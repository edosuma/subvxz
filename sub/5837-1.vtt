01:18.640 --> 01:20.688
JOURNEY TO ITALY

03:50.280 --> 03:52.248
Where are we?

03:52.360 --> 03:54.089
Oh, I don't know exactly.

03:55.360 --> 03:57.283
How far is it to Naples?

03:57.400 --> 03:59.050
About a hundred kilometres, I think.

04:03.560 --> 04:05.642
Do you mind if I drive?

04:05.760 --> 04:07.762
I'm afraid I'll fall asleep otherwise.

04:07.880 --> 04:09.803
All right. Fine. If you wish.

04:29.240 --> 04:30.765
Did you see that?

04:30.880 --> 04:33.531
It's incredible the way
some people drive here.

04:33.640 --> 04:36.928
Like madmen. They should amuse you.

04:44.400 --> 04:46.050
What noisy people.

04:46.160 --> 04:49.881
I've never seen noise and boredom
go so well together.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.206
Oh, I don't know.

04:51.320 --> 04:54.688
Uncle Homer lived here for 40 years
without getting bored.

04:54.800 --> 04:57.371
Uncle Homer was not a normal person.

04:59.880 --> 05:02.724
I must write to my mother.
How long do you think we'll be here?

05:02.840 --> 05:04.285
Only a few days.

05:04.400 --> 05:06.084
If what that Burton fellow
wrote me is true,

05:06.200 --> 05:08.726
we shouldn't have any trouble
in disposing of the property.

05:08.840 --> 05:10.080
I'd never have come on this trip

05:10.200 --> 05:13.044
if I didn't think we could clean up
this inheritance mess in no time.

05:13.160 --> 05:17.609
Well, you know, that Burton, he seems
to be such an attentive, orderly person.

05:17.720 --> 05:20.087
How would he be such a good friend
of Uncle Homer's?

05:20.200 --> 05:23.363
I can't say. I only know that he was
with him for a number of years,

05:23.520 --> 05:26.091
and that Uncle Homer
trusted him completely.

05:49.360 --> 05:52.140
Oh, is... is that a streak of blood?

05:52.792 --> 05:56.090
No, that's just a bug,
squashed against the glass.

05:56.200 --> 05:58.521
The air is full of insects.

05:59.960 --> 06:02.531
Do you think there's any danger
of catching malaria?

06:02.640 --> 06:04.404
They say not.

06:05.200 --> 06:08.409
You know, I was just thinking what
a fool I was, three months ago in London.

06:08.560 --> 06:11.245
It would have been so easy
for me to solve the Louis deal.

06:11.360 --> 06:14.011
There were at least three solutions
that were better than the one I chose

06:14.120 --> 06:15.690
and I just couldn't think of them.

06:15.800 --> 06:17.689
And you think of them now?

06:17.800 --> 06:20.201
Now they seem very clear to me.

06:23.040 --> 06:27.045
Ah, but what a shame
John and Dorothy couldn't come with us.

06:27.160 --> 06:28.764
Yes, it is.

06:48.080 --> 06:50.287
If only you'd listened to me,
we could have come by plane.

06:50.400 --> 06:51.731
We would have been back home a week ago.

06:51.840 --> 06:53.888
But I wanted you to take a rest.

06:54.680 --> 06:58.730
It didn't occur to me that it would be
so boring for you to be alone with me.

06:59.440 --> 07:03.001
What's that got to do with it? I'm just
bored because I've got nothing to do.

07:08.800 --> 07:11.007
This is the first time

07:11.120 --> 07:15.011
that we've been really alone,
ever since we married.

07:17.240 --> 07:19.607
Yes, I suppose it is.

08:22.080 --> 08:23.286
Good evening, sir.

08:23.400 --> 08:25.687
Good evening, madam. Good evening, sir.

08:25.800 --> 08:28.371
Uh, good evening. We have a reservation
under the name of Joyce.

08:28.520 --> 08:31.330
Yes, Mr Joyce.
Will you come this way, please?

08:33.360 --> 08:35.203
Good evening Mrs Joyce.
Good evening, sir.

08:35.320 --> 08:37.765
Rooms 317 and 318.

08:37.880 --> 08:39.722
Follow me, please.

08:40.760 --> 08:42.842
Excuse me, sir.
There is some mail for you.

08:42.960 --> 08:44.803
Oh, thanks.

08:48.320 --> 08:50.129
Good evening, sir.

08:57.560 --> 09:00.166
- Shall we have something to drink?
- Yes.

09:00.280 --> 09:02.806
But not here. Let's go down to the bar.

09:02.920 --> 09:04.968
At least there'll be
some other people around.

09:05.880 --> 09:09.680
Why? Would it be so terribly boring
if we were to remain alone?

09:09.800 --> 09:12.201
No, I was thinking of you.

09:12.320 --> 09:14.926
I don't think you're very happy
when we're alone.

09:18.520 --> 09:20.966
Are you sure you know when I'm happy?

09:21.080 --> 09:24.004
No. Ever since we left on this trip,
I'm not so sure.

09:24.120 --> 09:28.205
I realise for the first time that we...
we're like strangers.

09:30.320 --> 09:31.810
That's right.

09:31.920 --> 09:35.163
After eight years of marriage it seems
we don't know anything about each other.

09:35.280 --> 09:37.601
At home, everything seemed so perfect.

09:38.360 --> 09:40.931
But now that we're away and alone...

09:41.040 --> 09:42.769
Yes.

09:42.880 --> 09:45.247
It's a strange discovery to make.

09:46.720 --> 09:48.449
- Yes, sir.
- Will you send off this wire, please?

09:48.600 --> 09:50.364
- At once, sir.
- Thank you.

09:51.800 --> 09:55.850
Now that we're strangers, we can
start all over again at the beginning.

09:55.960 --> 09:58.122
Might be rather amusing,
don't you think?

09:59.600 --> 10:01.523
Let's go down to the bar.

10:26.320 --> 10:28.402
- Well, I don't see why...
- Oh, look!

10:28.560 --> 10:30.244
- Judy! How nice to see you.
- Alex! Katherine!

10:30.360 --> 10:32.442
- Are you here?
- I've been here for the day.

10:32.600 --> 10:34.921
I've been living in Capri
for the last three months.

10:35.040 --> 10:37.042
- But what are you doing here?
- Just a business trip.

10:37.160 --> 10:39.561
- Yes, a pleasure trip too.
- Oh, how nice.

10:39.680 --> 10:41.728
Look, we're just going to dinner.
Won't you join us?

10:41.840 --> 10:44.286
- Oh, this is Leslie Harris.
- How do you do?

10:44.400 --> 10:46.243
- Miss Restelli and Paul Dupont.
- Hello.

10:46.360 --> 10:48.647
Hello. Miss Sinibaldi and Miss Notari.

10:48.760 --> 10:50.649
- Hello.
- How do you do?

10:50.760 --> 10:52.569
Well... shall we have a drink first?

10:52.680 --> 10:55.365
Yes, come on. Have a drink with us?

10:55.520 --> 10:57.727
I never dreamt I would...
I would run into you here.

10:57.840 --> 11:00.411
Angelo, a glass of mineral water.

11:00.560 --> 11:02.528
You know she broke her leg a month ago?

11:02.640 --> 11:05.166
We brought her to Naples
to have the cast removed.

11:05.280 --> 11:07.044
She'll be all right again tomorrow.

11:07.160 --> 11:10.323
- A dry martini.
- Let's hurry with those drinks. I'm starving.

13:17.840 --> 13:19.763
Wake up, Alex.

13:21.320 --> 13:23.641
Wake up. It's terribly late.

13:24.680 --> 13:26.250
I called that man, Mr Burton.

13:26.360 --> 13:29.204
He'll be here in a little while
to take us to the house.

13:30.840 --> 13:33.002
Wake up! It's late!

13:35.440 --> 13:38.205
I must say,
one sleeps well in this country.

13:40.600 --> 13:43.365
I was dreaming about something.
I can't remember what it was.

13:43.520 --> 13:47.286
Maybe the charming Judy
we were so lucky to meet last night.

13:47.400 --> 13:51.200
- Maybe.
- I've never seen you in such good form.

13:51.320 --> 13:54.563
- Do you know her well?
- Yes.

13:54.680 --> 13:56.967
Well, I must get up.

13:59.520 --> 14:02.091
- Any tea?
- It's on its way up.

14:03.200 --> 14:07.524
How silly of me: I never realised
you were so interested in other women.

14:07.640 --> 14:09.526
Oh, you didn't?

14:14.320 --> 14:16.288
Hello?

14:16.400 --> 14:19.290
Oh, tell Mr Burton
that we'll be down in a few minutes.

14:19.400 --> 14:21.562
And send up a porter. Thank you.

14:21.680 --> 14:23.523
He's already here.

14:24.680 --> 14:27.729
There are two people
who are interested in buying the property.

14:27.840 --> 14:30.923
Too bad you want to sell it, though.
It's such a beautiful place.

14:31.040 --> 14:33.327
Yes, so I understand. But we must sell.

14:33.440 --> 14:35.647
I've become very fond of the place.

14:35.760 --> 14:37.762
You see, I arrived there during the war.

14:37.880 --> 14:40.770
It was all locked up,
practically deserted.

14:40.880 --> 14:44.009
The moment I saw it,
I requisitioned it immediately.

14:44.120 --> 14:47.169
It kept it from being robbed and ruined.

14:47.280 --> 14:49.681
One day, Uncle Homer arrived.

14:49.800 --> 14:51.609
He had taken refuge in Capri,

14:51.720 --> 14:54.246
where he was constantly
being watched by the police,

14:54.360 --> 14:55.964
practically interned, poor fellow.

14:56.080 --> 14:58.321
That's right. We had no news from him
for the whole duration of the war.

14:58.440 --> 15:00.522
It was madness to want to stay here
in an enemy country.

15:00.640 --> 15:04.645
Oh, I don't think he had
such a bad time in Capri, really.

15:04.760 --> 15:07.969
He had many friends.
Everybody liked him.

15:08.080 --> 15:12.244
Homer was the kind of a man you...
you couldn't help liking, you know?

15:13.880 --> 15:15.928
After the Allies had broken
through the Gothic line,

15:16.040 --> 15:18.122
I was transferred to Venice.

15:18.240 --> 15:20.288
That's where I got engaged.

15:21.360 --> 15:24.762
Homer had become just...
just like a father to both of us.

15:25.920 --> 15:27.888
Ah! There's the house right up there.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.401
The white one. Do you see it?

15:34.080 --> 15:36.082
They're here!

15:37.320 --> 15:39.209
Madam, they've arrived.

15:42.240 --> 15:44.049
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

15:44.160 --> 15:45.286
Welcome.

15:45.400 --> 15:47.243
- This is Natalia, my wife.
- How do you do?

15:47.360 --> 15:50.011
Please go on in.
I'll take care of the baggage.

15:50.120 --> 15:52.043
Please come in.

15:54.360 --> 15:56.124
This way, please.

15:56.960 --> 15:59.122
You see, this is one
of the drawing rooms

15:59.240 --> 16:02.369
where your uncle dined
when he had guests.

16:02.520 --> 16:05.967
And we used to
set up a large table right here.

16:06.080 --> 16:08.560
I never knew my uncle
had such good taste.

16:08.680 --> 16:10.762
And now this way, please.

16:16.320 --> 16:19.005
Oh, this is beautiful, isn't it?

16:21.520 --> 16:24.444
Oh, in there
are the kitchen and the pantry.

16:24.600 --> 16:26.165
Please.

16:31.560 --> 16:34.166
Look at her, Tony.
Doesn't she look like Lydia?

16:34.280 --> 16:37.124
- Oh, no, I don't think so.
- The profile.

16:37.240 --> 16:39.163
Much better looking, of course.

16:39.280 --> 16:41.521
Aren't they lovely?
Those are French porcelains.

16:41.640 --> 16:43.722
They are vieux Paris.

16:43.840 --> 16:45.569
Come!

16:46.520 --> 16:48.363
I want you to see the terrace.

16:48.520 --> 16:49.965
There's the Vesuvius.

16:50.080 --> 16:53.846
Ever since the eruption of 1944,
there's been a period of calm.

16:53.960 --> 16:56.930
Ah, but the temperature is beginning
to rise a little, though.

16:57.040 --> 17:01.170
That white back there, behind the hill,
that first hill, is Pompeii.

17:01.280 --> 17:04.011
There's Castellammare,
Torre Annunziata...

17:04.119 --> 17:07.124
Resina is over there. And Naples...

17:08.400 --> 17:10.641
There's Ischia, the isle of Capri.

17:10.760 --> 17:14.287
And that large strip down there
is the... Sorrento peninsula.

17:14.400 --> 17:15.560
Beautiful, isn't it?

17:15.680 --> 17:17.409
- Oh, yes.
- Right.

17:24.839 --> 17:27.002
This way, please.

17:31.640 --> 17:36.009
A Neopolitan painter of the 19th century.
Palizzi. Quite famous.

17:54.560 --> 17:56.608
Here we have sunshine all day long.

17:56.720 --> 17:59.041
It was your Uncle Homer's
favourite corner.

18:04.440 --> 18:06.647
And here are your bedrooms.

18:13.920 --> 18:17.208
- And this will be your room, Mrs Joyce.
- Oh, very nice.

18:20.320 --> 18:22.971
Ah, the baggage. Put it here, eh?

18:23.840 --> 18:25.808
- Thank you.
- Brava!

18:25.920 --> 18:27.763
- Are you having your lunch here?
- Yes.

18:27.880 --> 18:30.167
I'll have things ready in an hour.

18:30.280 --> 18:32.362
Thank you very much.

18:34.520 --> 18:37.171
- Do you like it?
- Yes, delicious.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.968
Of course, if you're going
to stay here for a while,

18:40.080 --> 18:42.970
we'll have to do something about
getting servants for you.

18:43.080 --> 18:45.321
Well, if you can find somebody.
Just for a few days.

18:45.440 --> 18:46.805
Only a few days?

18:46.920 --> 18:49.048
We can't stay very long.

18:49.160 --> 18:52.642
Our government doesn't make it possible
for us to stay abroad for very long.

18:52.760 --> 18:54.922
10 pounds a day for a month, you know.

18:55.040 --> 18:57.771
Yes, I know. I was very lucky.

18:57.880 --> 19:01.043
I came here right after the war
as soon as I got out of the army.

19:01.720 --> 19:03.131
Then we got married.

19:03.240 --> 19:05.686
This wine is excellent.

19:05.800 --> 19:09.168
Then Uncle Homer gave us hospitality
here in the hunting lodge.

19:09.280 --> 19:13.080
I found something to do in Pompeii.
The excavations, you know.

19:13.200 --> 19:15.771
I had taken a course in archaeology.

19:15.880 --> 19:18.929
You... you must come out there someday.

19:19.040 --> 19:20.929
We certainly will.

19:21.040 --> 19:23.008
I'm so anxious to see Pompeii.

19:28.200 --> 19:31.044
I don't seem to be able
to quench my thirst. How about you?

19:31.160 --> 19:34.960
Me? No. Did you notice,
I hardly touched the food?

19:35.080 --> 19:38.163
I can't understand what it is.
Perhaps it's all this garlic and oil.

19:38.280 --> 19:39.964
I've quaffed down
a whole bottle of wine.

19:40.080 --> 19:43.527
- Watch yourself. It might make you ill.
- No.

19:43.640 --> 19:45.449
Where's everybody gone to?

19:45.600 --> 19:48.524
I heard somebody talking
inside the house.

19:48.640 --> 19:51.041
I think I'll go and see what's going on.

20:17.040 --> 20:20.601
Oh... excuse me.
I'm sorry to trouble you.

20:21.640 --> 20:25.087
Well... I'm terribly thirsty.

20:25.200 --> 20:28.568
It's this food, you know.
I'm not used to all those sauces.

20:28.680 --> 20:31.763
- But what do you want?
- Something to drink.

20:31.880 --> 20:36.841
If you're feeling sick,
go have a bicarbonate.

20:36.960 --> 20:39.930
Eh, well, but I just
want you to fill it up.

20:40.040 --> 20:43.567
I understand. You 're feeling sick.
But what do you want me to do?

20:43.680 --> 20:47.526
This wine is excellent, you know,
but I'd just like you to fill it up.

20:47.640 --> 20:52.123
Take a bicarbonate.
I can't give you one. I don't have any.

20:53.240 --> 20:55.527
But... you misunderstand me.

20:55.640 --> 20:57.927
I want...
I want to fill it up with wine.

20:58.040 --> 21:00.691
He doesn't understand you.
What confusion!

21:00.800 --> 21:03.929
Take him to Signor Tony.
He will understand what he is saying! Go!

21:04.040 --> 21:05.530
OK.

21:05.640 --> 21:08.962
We don't have any. Come with me.

21:09.080 --> 21:11.811
Come! Come!

21:13.120 --> 21:15.327
Come! Come!

21:15.440 --> 21:19.923
- How dare you speak to me like that?
- Come with me to Signor Tony.

21:20.040 --> 21:23.089
Come! Come!

21:25.120 --> 21:30.081
Come. Come with me.
I don't want to be responsible for this.

21:35.920 --> 21:37.649
- Yes, what is it?
- Excuse me.

21:37.760 --> 21:41.401
The gentleman doesn't understand me.
He's feeling sick.

21:42.000 --> 21:45.971
- I think he wants a bicarbonate.
- She says she doesn't understand you.

21:46.080 --> 21:48.731
I'm dying of thirst.
I'd like to have a drink.

21:49.440 --> 21:51.647
The gentleman would like some wine.

21:51.760 --> 21:53.967
How am I supposed to understand him?

21:54.080 --> 21:57.163
Waving that bottle around!
I thought he was sick.

21:57.280 --> 21:59.328
Obviously, the poor woman
couldn't understand you.

21:59.440 --> 22:01.920
It seems you weren't making
the right gestures.

22:02.040 --> 22:04.042
- Well, what gestures should I make?
- Well...

22:04.160 --> 22:06.208
Picking up a bottle,
you should do like this.

22:06.320 --> 22:07.560
Yes.

22:07.680 --> 22:09.364
Well, what do I do
for a bottle of mineral water?

22:09.520 --> 22:10.760
That's simple.

22:10.880 --> 22:14.089
The gentleman would like
a bottle of mineral wafer.

22:14.680 --> 22:16.928
All right? I'll close it.

22:22.960 --> 22:26.043
Everybody's asleep.
It might be the middle of the night.

22:28.440 --> 22:30.647
- Are you asleep too?
- Almost.

22:32.080 --> 22:34.082
Oh, it's so nice in the sun.

22:34.200 --> 22:36.248
Why don't you sit down too?

22:48.160 --> 22:50.049
Temple of the spirit

22:51.360 --> 22:54.204
No longer bodies

22:54.320 --> 22:58.211
But pure ascetic images

22:59.320 --> 23:01.049
Do you remember poor Charles?

23:01.160 --> 23:04.607
- Charles who?
- Charles Lewington.

23:04.720 --> 23:08.167
- Lewington?
- Mmh, he died two years ago.

23:08.280 --> 23:10.328
Oh, and... you just heard about it?

23:10.440 --> 23:13.887
No, I knew the day after his death.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.809
Two years ago.

23:16.720 --> 23:18.245
Lewington.

23:18.360 --> 23:20.966
I don't seem to be able
to remember the fella.

23:21.080 --> 23:24.323
- Where did we meet him?
- At the Hooper-Smiths.

23:24.440 --> 23:26.090
- Was he a lawyer?
- No.

23:26.200 --> 23:28.407
No, he was a poet.

23:28.560 --> 23:32.565
He was thin, tall, fair...
So pale and spiritual.

23:34.280 --> 23:38.251
He was stationed here in Italy
during the war.

23:38.360 --> 23:40.806
Right here, as a matter of fact.

23:42.360 --> 23:44.806
Oh, yes, I think I remember him.
He was at...

23:44.920 --> 23:48.049
one of... Arthur's concerts.

23:49.240 --> 23:51.846
He had a fit of coughing
and had to leave the auditorium.

23:51.960 --> 23:56.170
Oh, yes, he was very ill.
Something he caught during the war.

23:56.280 --> 23:59.363
You know, that young man
started me thinking about something.

24:00.520 --> 24:02.010
About what?

24:02.840 --> 24:04.808
That you can learn more
from the way a man coughs

24:04.920 --> 24:06.763
than from the way he speaks.

24:07.760 --> 24:11.048
- What did Charles's cough tell you?
- That he was a fool.

24:11.160 --> 24:14.881
- He was not a fool. He was a poet!
- What's the difference?

24:15.000 --> 24:17.401
Charles wrote some wonderful poems.

24:17.560 --> 24:19.722
- I must get one of his books.
- Well, you won't find any.

24:19.840 --> 24:22.241
He was too young
to have any of his books published.

24:22.360 --> 24:26.410
- Then how did you know about them?
- He read them to me. I even copied some.

24:27.640 --> 24:29.961
Temple of the spirit

24:30.080 --> 24:33.721
No longer bodies but pure ascetic images

24:34.800 --> 24:38.043
Compared to which mere thought seems

24:38.160 --> 24:41.562
Flesh, heavy, dim...

24:41.680 --> 24:43.444
He wrote them here in Italy,
while he was in the war.

24:43.600 --> 24:46.524
I never knew
you were such great friends.

24:46.640 --> 24:49.849
Oh, I knew him before I met you.

24:49.960 --> 24:52.804
- Were you in love with him?
- No.

24:52.920 --> 24:54.843
But we got on terribly well together.

24:54.960 --> 24:57.531
I saw a great deal of him
at Copping Farm.

24:57.640 --> 25:01.770
Then he got desperately ill.
I couldn't even visit him.

25:01.880 --> 25:04.281
For almost a year, I didn't see him.

25:04.400 --> 25:06.880
Then on the eve of our wedding,

25:07.000 --> 25:09.844
the night before I left for London,

25:09.960 --> 25:14.602
I was packing my bags when I heard
a sound of pebbles on my window.

25:14.720 --> 25:18.805
And the rain was so heavy
that I couldn't see anyone outside.

25:19.720 --> 25:23.441
So I ran out, into the garden,
just as I was.

25:23.600 --> 25:25.329
And there he stood.

25:26.240 --> 25:28.766
He was shivering with cold.

25:28.880 --> 25:31.008
He was so strange and romantic.

25:31.120 --> 25:33.964
Maybe he wanted to prove to me

25:34.080 --> 25:38.051
that in spite of the high fever
he had braved the rain to see me.

25:39.320 --> 25:42.130
Or maybe he wanted to die.

25:42.240 --> 25:46.086
How very poetic.
Much more poetic than his verses.

25:52.600 --> 25:54.443
Alex!

25:56.360 --> 26:00.081
- Alex, may I take the car?
- Yes, of course, go ahead.

26:00.200 --> 26:01.690
- Good morning, Mrs Joyce.
- Good morning.

26:01.800 --> 26:03.802
- Where are you going?
- To Naples.

26:03.920 --> 26:06.685
- Well, what's your hurry?
- No, I'm in no hurry.

26:06.800 --> 26:08.006
Well what is it then?

26:08.120 --> 26:10.122
Well, if you need the car
I can borrow Mrs Burton's.

26:10.240 --> 26:11.765
I've already told you
I don't need the car.

26:11.880 --> 26:14.326
I'm waiting here to see the people
that are interested in buying the villa,

26:14.440 --> 26:16.090
and I think it might be a good idea
if you were here too.

26:16.200 --> 26:17.361
Oh, but why?

26:17.520 --> 26:19.443
Well, I don't know,
I think it might be a good idea.

26:19.600 --> 26:21.887
- You can leave after they've seen it.
- No, then I'd be too late.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.685
I want to go to the museum
and they close at four o'clock.

26:24.800 --> 26:26.131
I... I don't want to miss anything.

26:26.240 --> 26:28.527
- Aren't you going to have some lunch?
- I've had a sandwich.

26:28.640 --> 26:31.007
Well, I better get started.

26:31.120 --> 26:35.091
Is this the museum that your friend...
What was his name?

26:35.200 --> 26:37.806
- ...described in his verses?
- Maybe.

26:44.760 --> 26:46.922
I hate him.

26:50.160 --> 26:52.242
The brute!

27:37.080 --> 27:40.004
Watermelons, very fresh and cheap!

27:41.080 --> 27:43.287
He thinks he understands life.

27:43.400 --> 27:47.007
He ought to be punished for his pride,
his self-assurance.

27:49.440 --> 27:51.761
Ah, this must be it.

27:53.600 --> 27:57.321
Come! Come up to clean!

28:03.960 --> 28:06.884
'Morning. Do you have a guide, Madam?

28:07.000 --> 28:08.923
No. I haven't got one yet.

28:09.040 --> 28:11.691
- Do you wish to visit the art gallery?
- Yes, that would be fine.

28:11.800 --> 28:13.689
- Very well. Did you buy a ticket?
- No.

28:13.800 --> 28:16.963
You go inside.
I'll get the ticket. Just a second.

28:26.680 --> 28:28.523
This way, please.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.890
Many years ago,
this was a cavalry barracks.

28:34.000 --> 28:37.686
In 1700, King Charles
made a museum of it.

28:37.800 --> 28:39.609
The museum is very important.

28:39.720 --> 28:43.520
At one time, there were secret rooms,
with paintings of Pompeii.

28:43.640 --> 28:47.167
There are groups of sculptures here
from many famous collections:

28:47.280 --> 28:49.567
Capodimonte, Herculano,
Pompeii, and so forth.

28:50.320 --> 28:52.926
This is the famous group of dancers.

28:53.040 --> 28:55.281
They were found in a villa at Herculano.

28:55.400 --> 28:57.880
Observe the harmony of their movements.

28:58.000 --> 29:01.288
The fourth one looks
just like my daughter, Marianna.

29:06.800 --> 29:09.610
This satyr was in the villa at Pompeii.

29:09.720 --> 29:12.929
It is a pagan divinity
that was found in the woods.

29:13.040 --> 29:17.250
It is a good thing they exist no longer.
They were very dangerous.

29:18.920 --> 29:21.048
This is the drunken faun.

29:21.160 --> 29:23.606
He is about to fall asleep.

29:24.800 --> 29:27.087
Sleep is a wonderful habit.

29:33.680 --> 29:36.570
Here, we have a young discus thrower.

29:36.680 --> 29:38.603
A Greek.

29:39.440 --> 29:41.727
And here are the emperors.

29:41.840 --> 29:43.330
This is Caracalla.

29:43.440 --> 29:46.250
He built the famous
public baths in Rome.

29:46.360 --> 29:49.807
He killed his brother
right in his mother's arms.

29:52.680 --> 29:55.923
This is Nero.
You must have heard of him.

29:56.040 --> 29:58.691
He had the face of a baby,
but he was a madman.

29:58.800 --> 30:03.124
He burned Rome and killed
his whole family, even his mother.

30:06.200 --> 30:07.884
Tiberius.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.810
He spent almost all his life
on the isle of Capri,

30:10.920 --> 30:12.888
because he liked to live well.

30:13.000 --> 30:14.764
He was a little crazy too.

30:14.880 --> 30:17.929
He used to feed
his slaves to the fishes.

30:18.040 --> 30:20.646
Funny emperors, don't you think, lady?

30:22.280 --> 30:25.363
This is the Venus I like most.

30:25.520 --> 30:28.046
She is not as young as the others.

30:28.160 --> 30:32.802
She is more... more mature.
Don't you agree, lady?

30:33.680 --> 30:35.125
Perhaps. I wouldn't know.

30:35.240 --> 30:38.528
And over here is
the marvellous Farnese Hercules.

30:39.520 --> 30:43.161
It was found in the Baths
of Caracalla in Rome.

30:43.280 --> 30:48.411
It is over ten feet tall
and 2,200 years old.

30:48.560 --> 30:51.564
It shows Hercules resting on a club.

30:52.560 --> 30:57.805
It looks like everybody takes a rest
around here except me.

30:57.920 --> 31:00.161
Oh, it's wonderful.

31:02.440 --> 31:08.402
Down there is the famous Farnese bull,
carved out of a single block of marble.

31:08.560 --> 31:13.930
It's over 12 feet high.
And it was restored by Michelangelo.

31:14.040 --> 31:17.806
It's said to be the largest
marble group in the world.

31:20.040 --> 31:24.011
This group represents the sons of Antiope,
Amphion and Zethus,

31:24.120 --> 31:25.884
who to avenge their mother

31:26.000 --> 31:30.130
tied the cruel Queen Dirce
to the horn of an angry bull.

31:38.880 --> 31:41.531
To think that those men lived
thousands of years ago

31:41.640 --> 31:43.927
and you feel that they are
just like the men of today.

31:44.040 --> 31:45.804
It's amazing.

31:46.600 --> 31:50.810
It is as if Nero or, or Caracalla,
Cesar or Tiberius

31:50.920 --> 31:52.524
would suddenly tell you what they felt.

31:52.640 --> 31:55.211
And you could understand
exactly what they were like.

31:55.320 --> 31:58.244
- Then they're not ascetic figures.
- No, not at all.

32:00.240 --> 32:04.040
Poor Charles. He had a way all his own
of seeing things.

32:04.160 --> 32:06.367
What struck me
was the complete lack of modesty

32:06.520 --> 32:08.010
with which everything is expressed.

32:08.120 --> 32:10.282
There was absolutely no attempt to...

32:10.400 --> 32:11.526
- Come in.
- Come in.

32:11.640 --> 32:14.883
I'm so sorry to trouble you, but an
old friend of your Uncle Homer phoned,

32:15.000 --> 32:17.571
his dearest friend, in fact,
the Duke of Lippoli.

32:17.680 --> 32:19.045
He would like to meet you.

32:19.160 --> 32:22.164
'Course I told him that you weren't
at home and could he please call later.

32:22.280 --> 32:24.647
Well, when he calls again,
I'd like to talk to him.

32:24.760 --> 32:27.161
- Might be rather fun to meet him.
- Yes.

32:28.880 --> 32:31.724
- Very good, then. Good night.
- Good night.

32:33.000 --> 32:35.002
Let's go and eat.

32:48.840 --> 32:50.808
Why don't we try to enjoy our vacation?

32:50.920 --> 32:53.287
Well, if we don't, it's your fault.

32:54.640 --> 32:57.120
You don't realise
how mean you can be sometimes.

32:57.240 --> 33:00.050
It's more than anyone can stand.

33:06.320 --> 33:08.288
Did those people come to see the house?

33:08.400 --> 33:09.640
Yes.

33:09.760 --> 33:12.286
- What did they decide?
- Nothing.

33:12.400 --> 33:13.890
Nothing?

33:14.880 --> 33:17.929
They're going to make me an offer
on Thursday.

33:18.040 --> 33:20.281
What kind of people were they?

33:20.400 --> 33:22.265
Rather talkative.

33:23.440 --> 33:25.249
What... What was that?

33:27.760 --> 33:31.401
How dare you say that!

33:31.560 --> 33:34.723
Quiet! Get out of here!

33:36.800 --> 33:39.929
They're getting married in a week
and they're always fighting.

33:40.040 --> 33:41.690
It's jealousy.

33:41.800 --> 33:44.087
How could anyone be jealous
before marriage?

33:44.200 --> 33:47.443
Well, the time just before marriage
is a very delicate one.

33:47.600 --> 33:49.250
Oh!

34:36.600 --> 34:38.329
- Duque de Lippoli?
- Yes.

34:38.440 --> 34:41.011
- Second floor.
- Thank you.

35:15.600 --> 35:17.284
Thank you.

35:18.520 --> 35:20.170
Good evening. Very happy to meet you.

35:20.280 --> 35:21.770
- How do you do?
- Hello.

35:21.880 --> 35:24.087
- Please, do come in.
- How do you do?

35:24.200 --> 35:25.201
Please.

35:25.320 --> 35:26.810
I'm so glad you could come.

35:26.920 --> 35:28.684
We've been looking forward
to meeting you.

35:28.800 --> 35:31.531
I didn't know Homer had
such a beautiful niece.

35:31.640 --> 35:33.369
These are all friends of Homer.

35:33.520 --> 35:36.171
I want you to meet
the Duchesses of Montalban...

35:36.280 --> 35:38.521
the Duke of Marino. Come, Mrs Joyce.

35:38.640 --> 35:41.007
Would you like something to drink,
Mr Joyce?

35:42.840 --> 35:45.571
And may I introduce
the Count and Countess of Trebisonda,

35:45.680 --> 35:47.330
Prince and Princess Melissa

35:47.440 --> 35:49.283
Mrs Joyce.

35:50.280 --> 35:52.248
Won't you sit down, please.

35:53.280 --> 35:55.169
Thank you.

35:55.280 --> 35:58.124
That old joker Homer kept it a secret

35:58.240 --> 36:00.208
that he had such a beauty in the family.

36:00.320 --> 36:01.810
He had a mania for keeping secrets.

36:01.920 --> 36:03.729
- Even his death.
- Yes.

36:03.840 --> 36:06.969
We found out about it
quite a while after he'd been buried.

36:07.560 --> 36:10.450
We'll get even with him
up there someday.

36:10.600 --> 36:12.125
We'll pay him a surprise visit.

36:12.240 --> 36:15.369
And I bet he'll pretend
to be really surprised.

36:15.520 --> 36:18.285
What an unusual home you have.
And so comfortable.

36:18.400 --> 36:20.607
That sounds to me
like one of those compliments

36:20.720 --> 36:24.520
that hide the usual reproach:
Dolce farniente.

36:24.640 --> 36:26.404
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

36:26.560 --> 36:29.166
How do you say in English,
Dolce farniente?

36:29.280 --> 36:31.328
It is impossible to say it in English.

36:31.440 --> 36:36.048
Perhaps I could translate it,
"How sweet it is to do nothing."

36:36.160 --> 36:37.764
Oh, I understand.

36:37.880 --> 36:40.326
They say
that all Neopolitans are loafers.

36:40.440 --> 36:41.965
Now I'd like to ask you:

36:42.080 --> 36:45.402
Would you say
that a shipwrecked man is a loafer?

36:45.560 --> 36:48.689
In a certain sense,
we're all shipwrecked.

36:48.800 --> 36:51.929
You have to fight so hard
just to keep afloat.

36:52.040 --> 36:54.771
Well, it looks like
a very pleasant shipwreck to me.

36:54.880 --> 36:59.102
Especially when I look into your eyes.
They're like stars in the night.

37:00.840 --> 37:04.162
- Do you like Naples?
- Well, I haven't seen very much yet.

37:04.280 --> 37:06.886
- When did you arrive?
- Three days ago.

37:07.000 --> 37:08.764
Did you come by plane?

37:08.880 --> 37:10.962
No, we... motored down.

37:20.800 --> 37:22.802
Like something to drink?

37:22.920 --> 37:24.922
All right.

37:30.200 --> 37:32.089
Brandy?

37:32.200 --> 37:34.362
Yes, please.

37:36.960 --> 37:39.281
Have a good time?

37:39.400 --> 37:41.004
No.

37:41.840 --> 37:43.046
That's strange.

37:43.160 --> 37:46.209
It's a long time since I've seen you
in such a good mood.

37:46.320 --> 37:49.164
You seemed pretty gay yourself.

37:49.280 --> 37:52.204
Well, what did you want me to do,
look bored?

37:52.320 --> 37:55.802
Why don't you admit
that you did have a good time?

37:56.920 --> 37:59.685
I don't even want to talk about it.

37:59.800 --> 38:02.531
All those Italians milling around you.

38:03.600 --> 38:05.841
What were they doing,
telling you funny stories?

38:05.960 --> 38:07.849
Jealous?

38:07.960 --> 38:10.042
Is that what you think?

38:11.000 --> 38:13.924
Ever since we realised
how little we meant to each other, you...

38:14.040 --> 38:16.122
You've done everything you could
to make things worse.

38:16.240 --> 38:18.288
And what about you?

38:19.200 --> 38:21.407
You haven't said a word
or made a gesture

38:21.560 --> 38:23.324
to try to save what little is left
of our marriage.

38:23.440 --> 38:25.886
But why should I
make the effort all alone?

38:26.000 --> 38:28.128
Because it's your fault.

38:28.240 --> 38:30.447
The whole thing is your fault.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.526
I think you ought to know that it
didn't take me long after we were married

38:34.640 --> 38:36.563
to realise what was wrong.

38:38.040 --> 38:41.249
There was always criticism in your eyes,
criticism until it crushed me.

38:41.360 --> 38:42.646
Nonsense.

38:42.760 --> 38:46.287
But it is rather surprising to hear you say
that what I felt was important to you.

38:46.400 --> 38:49.006
- What do you mean?
- Exactly what I say.

38:49.120 --> 38:52.169
You accuse me of criticising you.
Well, it isn't true.

38:52.280 --> 38:54.760
'Course there are a few things
which I don't like about you.

38:54.880 --> 38:56.006
I know that.

38:56.120 --> 39:01.001
Your lack of a sense of humour,
your ridiculous romanticism.

39:02.080 --> 39:03.923
But when I was reduced in rank

39:04.040 --> 39:06.168
from your wife
to a mere hostess for your friends,

39:06.280 --> 39:09.648
then to handling your public relations,
you seemed quite pleased.

39:09.760 --> 39:12.650
Now look, I don't want
to talk about this anymore.

39:12.760 --> 39:15.081
You know, I'm getting absolutely sick
of this crazy country.

39:15.200 --> 39:17.009
It poisons you with laziness.

39:17.120 --> 39:19.407
I want to get back home. Back to work.

39:19.560 --> 39:21.403
Oh, at last that big word.

39:21.560 --> 39:24.245
I haven't heard you mention it
for some time: "work."

39:24.360 --> 39:27.443
I expect you
to be talking about duty next.

39:27.600 --> 39:30.683
Do the words "work" and "duty" mean
nothing to you since you've been here?

39:30.800 --> 39:32.564
Don't be a hypocrite.

39:32.680 --> 39:34.284
Now that's enough.

39:34.400 --> 39:37.529
I think the best thing for us
is to stay away from one another.

39:37.640 --> 39:38.971
I'm going to Capri to wait there

39:39.080 --> 39:41.287
for the answer of the people
that are interested in the house.

39:41.400 --> 39:45.325
I'm sure you'll find Capri terribly exciting,
now that your friends are there.

39:45.440 --> 39:48.011
Now you have such lovely friends.

40:19.560 --> 40:21.528
Alex!

41:01.960 --> 41:03.689
To Capri.

41:04.840 --> 41:06.922
To have a good time.

41:07.840 --> 41:10.923
If he thinks he can make me jealous.

41:28.400 --> 41:33.725
- Who died?
- Don Pasquale. A good man.

41:44.880 --> 41:47.451
He thinks I'm going to give in.

41:47.600 --> 41:49.921
Thinks I'll run after him.

41:50.040 --> 41:52.361
He's mistaken.

41:53.440 --> 41:55.761
I've learned a great deal from him.

41:56.880 --> 41:58.689
He'll see.

41:59.720 --> 42:01.324
He'll see.

42:26.800 --> 42:29.770
To the left of the Acropolis
is the cave of the Sibyl.

42:29.880 --> 42:33.680
After the Greeks and the Romans,
this place was transformed into a fortress.

42:33.800 --> 42:36.929
- Ah, a fortress.
- Yes, a fortress, that's what I said.

42:37.680 --> 42:40.570
After abandoning
the ancient city of Troy,

42:40.680 --> 42:43.331
Aeneas landed here on this very beach.

42:43.440 --> 42:47.445
In the last war,
the British troops landed here.

42:47.600 --> 42:50.046
Really? British troops landed here?

42:50.160 --> 42:51.400
Yes, right here.

42:51.560 --> 42:54.325
- And where did they stay?
- All around here.

42:56.920 --> 42:59.844
This is the entrance to the caves
of the Sibyl, the Cumaean Sibyl.

43:00.600 --> 43:02.841
Oh, but it's enormous!

43:02.960 --> 43:05.247
Listen to the echo.

43:06.880 --> 43:08.325
Oh!

43:08.440 --> 43:10.249
Yes, I hear it. Wonderful.

43:10.360 --> 43:12.522
In ancient times,
you could hear it much louder

43:12.640 --> 43:16.257
when the walls were covered
with bronze. Oh!

43:17.280 --> 43:19.601
It's extraordinary.

43:21.600 --> 43:23.628
Oh!

43:24.840 --> 43:27.081
Now, at the end,
there are the rooms of the Sibyl,

43:27.200 --> 43:29.168
and these were her baths.

43:29.280 --> 43:31.408
This way, lady.

43:35.840 --> 43:39.083
The Christians
made them over into catacombs.

43:40.200 --> 43:41.770
You see, lady,

43:41.880 --> 43:45.202
it is here that lovers came
to question the Sibyl...

43:46.320 --> 43:49.210
When they wanted to know
what the course of their love would be.

43:49.320 --> 43:51.129
Temple of the spirit

43:51.240 --> 43:53.368
No longer bodies

43:53.520 --> 43:56.649
But pure ascetic images

44:05.520 --> 44:07.568
Lady... Lady...

44:07.680 --> 44:10.160
Don't you want to visit
the rooms of the Sibyl?

44:10.280 --> 44:12.760
No, thank you. Some other time.

44:13.680 --> 44:17.241
Excuse me, lady. You see these holes?

44:17.360 --> 44:21.126
It is there that the Saracenes
tied their prisoners.

44:21.240 --> 44:23.322
Allow me.

44:23.440 --> 44:28.002
This is the way they would have tied
a beautiful woman like you.

44:30.600 --> 44:32.204
What's this crazy woman doing?

44:39.000 --> 44:41.526
- Where is the temple of Apollo?
- It's up there.

44:41.640 --> 44:44.689
But I'm not coming, it's too windy.
Goodbye.

44:55.040 --> 44:57.168
Silly old fool.

44:59.880 --> 45:02.167
All men are alike.

46:11.360 --> 46:13.203
I hate you.

46:14.240 --> 46:16.766
Cynical. Cruel.

46:36.280 --> 46:38.965
Anything needed here?
Have a sandwich, Judy?

46:39.080 --> 46:40.930
- Some more?
- Yes.

46:43.080 --> 46:45.367
- And for you?
- Thank you.

46:47.560 --> 46:49.289
There.

46:49.400 --> 46:52.609
When I decided to leave my husband,
I had no problems.

46:52.720 --> 46:55.610
The only important thing was my freedom.

46:57.560 --> 47:02.407
You seem to have a lot of problems,
a lot of questions on your mind.

47:03.600 --> 47:06.968
It's because you love her,
and you're jealous.

47:07.080 --> 47:08.081
Jealous?

47:09.080 --> 47:11.686
- What time is it, darling?
- 10:30.

47:12.440 --> 47:14.681
10:30? it's late.

47:14.800 --> 47:16.370
Come on, everybody.

47:17.800 --> 47:21.088
We have a rule here
never to go to bed later than 10:30.

47:22.240 --> 47:24.527
Oh. Well, thank you... very much.

47:24.640 --> 47:26.005
- Goodbye.
- I had fun.

47:26.120 --> 47:28.600
- Good night.
- Good night.

47:28.720 --> 47:29.846
Good night.

47:32.120 --> 47:34.407
- Come on, honey.
- Come along, now.

47:34.560 --> 47:35.641
Let's go.

47:35.760 --> 47:39.242
- Thanks for coming, Alex.
- And you must come again sometime, eh?

47:39.360 --> 47:41.044
Thanks for the party.

47:41.160 --> 47:42.889
- Bye!
- Good night.

47:43.720 --> 47:46.564
- Good night.
- Good night.

47:46.680 --> 47:49.411
- Hey, wait for me.
- Well, come on, then.

47:56.000 --> 47:58.128
- Good night.
- Bye.

47:58.960 --> 48:00.291
Are you taking Marie home?

48:00.400 --> 48:03.006
- Yes, of course.
- All right. Good night.

48:07.040 --> 48:09.247
- Do you mind if I lean on you?
- No, not at all.

48:09.360 --> 48:11.089
Thank you.

48:13.280 --> 48:16.329
- Do you want to go home right away?
- Yes.

48:16.440 --> 48:19.091
- What a beautiful sky.
- Yes, it is.

48:20.120 --> 48:22.930
It's a pity that I can't
leave my window open.

48:23.040 --> 48:25.850
- Night air is bad for me.
- Oh.

48:25.960 --> 48:27.610
But I leave the shutters open.

48:27.720 --> 48:32.282
And when I wake up in the night,
I can see the stars through the window.

48:32.400 --> 48:35.085
Well, that's a very lovely way
to look at the stars.

48:35.200 --> 48:36.850
This is where I live. Good night.

48:38.360 --> 48:41.125
- Shall I see you tomorrow?
- Oh, yes.

48:41.240 --> 48:43.561
- What time?
- At... eleven?

48:43.680 --> 48:44.681
All right.

48:44.800 --> 48:46.723
- Good night.
- Good night.

50:00.560 --> 50:02.961
This way, Madam, please.

50:08.240 --> 50:11.687
This little crater formed
during the last eruption.

50:11.800 --> 50:13.290
You can see the boiling lava.

50:13.400 --> 50:17.086
On this part, Madam, the crust
of the earth is only 12 feet thick.

50:17.200 --> 50:19.726
- But isn't it dangerous?
- No.

50:19.840 --> 50:23.162
Now I'll show you something
very interesting, the mystery of ionisation.

50:23.280 --> 50:26.841
- What is it? What does it mean?
- Well, it's a very interesting phenomenon.

50:26.960 --> 50:28.803
If you will watch now, I'll show you.

50:28.920 --> 50:33.403
All you have to do is light a torch
and the smoke increases everywhere,

50:33.560 --> 50:37.326
not only where we are now,
but in all the craters.

50:38.880 --> 50:40.006
Wait, I...

50:40.120 --> 50:43.010
- I must take a photo for my husband.
- Yes, yes, as you wish, Madam.

50:43.120 --> 50:45.009
I'm ready.

50:57.880 --> 50:59.848
There, here we are.

50:59.960 --> 51:03.521
Now you see. Look!
Look at the smoke in that corner.

51:03.640 --> 51:05.722
- Did you see what a cloud of smoke?
- Yes, that's right!

51:05.840 --> 51:08.207
- The smoke increase is not only here...
- And way over there, too.

51:08.320 --> 51:11.005
...but everywhere, all over the hill.

51:12.280 --> 51:15.011
Oh, that's... that's incredible!

51:17.360 --> 51:20.603
- This is extraordinary.
- Isn't it?

51:20.720 --> 51:22.449
And look over there.

51:29.720 --> 51:31.529
Observe down here.

51:31.640 --> 51:34.325
All right now, stand over there, please.

51:34.440 --> 51:36.522
And now, Madam,

51:36.640 --> 51:41.202
I'll show you the same effect of ionisation
produced by a cigarette.

51:41.320 --> 51:43.607
Yes, feel the heat at this opening.

51:43.720 --> 51:45.961
- And now, watch. Watch!
- It's hot.

51:50.880 --> 51:53.008
Now look. Look.

51:55.520 --> 51:58.683
You see? Not only here but all over.

51:58.800 --> 52:01.246
All over the hill, at the same time.

52:01.360 --> 52:05.001
The smoke increases over all the area.
Once more.

52:06.360 --> 52:09.091
- May I try?
- Of course, try yourself.

52:10.200 --> 52:12.328
- Let me hold it.
- Thanks.

52:20.440 --> 52:22.841
This way, Madam, please.

52:25.320 --> 52:28.244
This is another site you must not miss.

52:28.360 --> 52:32.160
This is the small Vesuvius,
called "the Pocket Vesuvius".

52:32.280 --> 52:35.727
It is one of the most interesting spots
in this area.

52:35.840 --> 52:40.767
In that corner, there are the boiling
cinders and lapillus. You'll see.

52:40.880 --> 52:44.123
Young man, come here. Stir there.

52:44.840 --> 52:46.808
Now look at that corner. Look, look!

52:46.920 --> 52:48.524
The lapillus, you see?

52:48.640 --> 52:53.123
Pompeii, you know, was destroyed
by a rain of burning lapillus and cinders.

52:53.240 --> 52:55.846
- Like these?
- Exactly.

52:55.960 --> 52:59.760
And now, if you will come this way.
Follow me, please.

53:02.360 --> 53:03.361
Good morning!

53:03.520 --> 53:05.648
Bonjour! I'm a little late.

53:05.760 --> 53:08.206
It doesn't matter. I'm very patient.

53:11.560 --> 53:14.325
- Where are we going?
- Well, would you like to go for a little walk?

53:14.440 --> 53:16.169
It'd be good for my leg.

53:16.280 --> 53:17.884
Which way should we go?

53:18.000 --> 53:20.162
- Let's go this way.
- All right.

53:22.320 --> 53:24.846
- Feeling better?
- Yes, thank you.

53:24.960 --> 53:27.645
Although I slept very little last night.

53:27.760 --> 53:30.525
- Oh? Why?
- Oh, I don't know.

53:30.640 --> 53:33.120
I feel so alone in my house.

53:33.240 --> 53:37.131
It seems kind of dead
without that disorder or something

53:37.240 --> 53:39.561
that a man leaves behind.

53:41.600 --> 53:44.604
The doors and the closets
creek strangely,

53:44.720 --> 53:47.769
seem to make sounds
I never heard before.

53:47.880 --> 53:52.522
And even the noises outside
seem louder, clearer.

53:52.640 --> 53:55.371
Footsteps in the streets or...
or a voice,

53:55.520 --> 53:59.366
or a child shouting,
or a radio in the distance.

54:00.840 --> 54:02.365
Fate is really strange.

54:03.920 --> 54:07.891
Such a big world. To think
that I might never have met you.

54:08.000 --> 54:11.561
You know, when I first saw you,
I hardly noticed you.

54:11.680 --> 54:15.287
And now, your happiness
is really quite important to me.

54:15.400 --> 54:18.210
But I am happy. Very happy.

54:18.320 --> 54:20.766
Everything is all right
with my husband now.

54:20.880 --> 54:23.121
I've been so nervous
for the past few days.

54:23.240 --> 54:26.449
You can't imagine
the letters we wrote each other.

54:26.600 --> 54:28.921
You see, he doesn't write very much,

54:29.040 --> 54:32.408
but when he wants
to really hurt someone,

54:32.560 --> 54:34.961
he can do it with one phrase.

54:35.080 --> 54:37.208
But everything is all right, now.

54:37.320 --> 54:39.926
He is coming back to Capri tonight.

55:08.080 --> 55:10.128
They'll bring the hot water
for your tea right away.

55:10.240 --> 55:11.605
Thanks.

55:11.720 --> 55:15.327
- Did you have an interesting day?
- Oh, yes, very.

55:15.440 --> 55:17.124
Did you see anything new?

55:17.240 --> 55:20.403
- Well, I saw the sulphur springs.
- Strange place, isn't it?

55:20.560 --> 55:23.131
Tell me, did you imagine
that Naples was like this?

55:25.320 --> 55:27.322
Oh, I can't say.

55:27.440 --> 55:29.841
Not quite as it is, perhaps.

55:29.960 --> 55:32.611
You haven't the faintest idea
what Naples is like.

55:32.720 --> 55:34.529
I must show you.

55:34.640 --> 55:38.929
Tomorrow, if you wish,
we can go together to visit the Fontanelle.

55:39.040 --> 55:41.771
- What is that?
- It's a... it's a catacomb,

55:41.880 --> 55:45.282
where they gather skeletons
from ancient cemeteries.

55:47.800 --> 55:49.370
Sounds very dismal.

55:49.520 --> 55:52.126
Dismal? Quite the contrary.

55:52.240 --> 55:54.083
These are the skeletons of people

55:54.200 --> 55:57.602
who died two, three, and even four
hundred years ago. Can you imagine?

55:57.720 --> 55:59.563
I don't think it sounds very amusing.

55:59.680 --> 56:01.887
But that's because
you've never been to the place.

56:02.000 --> 56:04.651
You wouldn't believe it,
but quite a few people go there.

56:04.760 --> 56:07.206
There are many people
who have chosen a skeleton,

56:07.320 --> 56:08.765
assembled it properly,

56:08.880 --> 56:10.564
take care of it lovingly,

56:10.680 --> 56:14.366
bring fresh flowers every so often,
and keep a lamp in front of it.

56:14.520 --> 56:16.443
But what is the meaning of all that?

56:17.600 --> 56:19.568
Oh, it's pity, I guess.

56:21.120 --> 56:23.885
These poor dead are abandoned and alone.

56:24.000 --> 56:27.607
They have no one to look after them,
no one to pray for them.

56:27.720 --> 56:30.041
Well, I don't understand.
I just can't understand it.

56:30.720 --> 56:35.205
I know, it's difficult to understand, but...
but you'll see for yourself.

56:37.000 --> 56:38.729
That must be the boat from Capri.

56:43.760 --> 56:46.001
Oh, yes, that must be it.

56:46.120 --> 56:48.282
Is your husband coming back tonight?

56:48.400 --> 56:51.244
Oh, I don't know. I don't think so.
He didn't phone me.

56:51.360 --> 56:53.442
Oh, I have a terrible headache.

56:53.600 --> 56:57.241
Ah, it's the sirocco.
The dampness in the air.

56:57.360 --> 57:01.570
Now if... if they would bring me the water
for my tea, I could take an aspirin.

57:01.680 --> 57:03.284
I'll see what's delaying them.

57:56.840 --> 57:58.888
There doesn't seem to be much
that a foreigner can do

57:59.000 --> 58:00.411
to amuse himself in this town.

58:00.560 --> 58:02.005
There are a few nightclubs, sir.

58:02.120 --> 58:06.250
Yes, I've tried them but...
I'm not much impressed.

58:06.360 --> 58:08.124
Did you visit the one on the left

58:08.240 --> 58:11.562
as you go out of the hotel,
about two blocks?

58:11.680 --> 58:14.365
- No, I haven't seen that one.
- There is a floor show there.

58:14.520 --> 58:16.761
It's a little better than the rest.

58:16.880 --> 58:19.281
I must investigate.

58:19.400 --> 58:23.325
- How much do I owe you?
- That will be 3,000 liras, sir.

58:24.920 --> 58:26.331
- Thank you.
- Good night.

58:26.440 --> 58:28.169
Good night, sir.

58:51.280 --> 58:53.044
Good evening.

58:55.400 --> 58:57.243
Good evening.

59:48.640 --> 59:50.005
Do you want me?

59:51.720 --> 59:54.371
I'm afraid I don't understand Italian.

59:54.520 --> 59:56.124
OK.

01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:13.607
You shameless, brazen hussy.

01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:15.722
What did you say?

01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:18.764
If you speak fast, I don't understand.

01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:20.530
Slowly.

01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:22.768
What did you say?

01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:26.043
Oh, nothing. Nothing important.

01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:55.291
- Cigarette?
- Thanks.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.571
Two night ago, a friend died.

01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:27.324
A woman friend.

01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:30.568
32 years old.

01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:35.400
In a nightclub.
She put her head on the table.

01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:37.449
And she died.

01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:39.523
But how? What of?

01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:41.927
It was her heart.

01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:44.566
She had a baby seven months ago.

01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:47.842
I'm sorry.

01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:55.644
If you didn't call me just now,

01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:58.889
I think I would have
thrown myself into the sea.

01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:03.369
- Isn't that a little extreme?
- Maybe.

01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:06.046
But it is what I would have done.

01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:07.924
Now look here.
After all, there are lots of...

01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:10.930
Listen. Where do you want to go?

01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:14.167
To your home?

01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:16.282
Are you in a hotel?

01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:18.323
Where do we go?

01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:21.124
Nowhere. Just forget it.

01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:24.528
I'll take you for a drive and then
I'll drop you off wherever you want to go.

01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:32.249
Alex!

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.570
Alex!

01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:41.085
Yes? What is it?

01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:47.451
I... I just wanted to
make sure it was you.

01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:51.684
- Who did you think it was?
- I was sound asleep. I...

01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:54.963
I had so much sun and air today
that I was dead tired.

01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:57.367
I fell asleep almost immediately.

01:04:57.520 --> 01:04:59.682
How well one sleeps here.

01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:01.723
Well... then...

01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:04.446
I... I woke up with a start
when I heard a noise.

01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:06.807
I didn't know... I...

01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:10.561
I didn't know that you were
coming back tonight.

01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:12.725
Well, as you see, here I am.

01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:18.964
- Did you have a good time?
- Not bad.

01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:22.922
What boat did you come back on?

01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:26.001
The one that leaves at five o'clock.

01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:29.090
Oh. Five o'clock?
What did you do until now?

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:33.003
I was in Naples.

01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:34.849
Oh.

01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:44.927
Anything else you want to know?

01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:46.565
Of course not.

01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:50.084
Then I... have your permission
to go to bed?

01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:52.123
Of course.

01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:55.122
Thank you.

01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:57.561
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.401
- Will you do me a favour?
- Yes.

01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:43.086
Have someone call me
at eleven o'clock tomorrow morning.

01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:44.804
And don't let anyone
disturb me until then.

01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:47.526
I haven't been sleeping very well
the last few nights.

01:06:48.680 --> 01:06:50.728
All right.

01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:52.729
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:19.284
I can't remember if I was supposed
to wake Alex before leaving.

01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:22.609
I guess not, though. He said something
about wanting to sleep until eleven.

01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:25.326
Sleep is always good for one.
Let him sleep.

01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:28.444
Oh, by the way, did he enjoy Capri?

01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:30.602
Not very much, I'm afraid.

01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:33.764
Oh, what a beautiful Madonna!

01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:37.207
Ah, there's some marvellous ones.

01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:39.402
Oh, let me tell you about a foreigner

01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:42.769
who was standing on the sidewalk
one day here in Naples.

01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:47.442
Suddenly, he noticed that everybody
was tipping their hats and waving to him.

01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:50.171
He couldn't understand
his sudden popularity

01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:55.002
until he realised he was standing
in front of one of those Madonnas.

01:07:58.120 --> 01:08:00.805
How many expectant mothers you see here.

01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:03.571
There are hundreds of them
in the streets of Naples.

01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:05.762
Count them in this space alone.

01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:10.363
Two... three... four... five...

01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:15.010
and another one down there: six.

01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:20.010
Now I'm sorry I took the car.

01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:22.087
Maybe he needed it.

01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:25.404
Oh, look there. Look at that donkey.

01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:29.689
Oh, what a load he's carrying,
and he's so little.

01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:33.009
But they're very strong.
It's a tough breed.

01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:39.446
The food here is spicy isn't it?

01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:44.002
- Why? Aren't you feeling well?
- Oh, yes, I was thinking of my husband.

01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:47.203
How beautiful the children are.

01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:50.567
I really think they are
very beautiful here.

01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:52.761
Is your husband also fond of children?

01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:55.008
Oh, I don't know.

01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:57.167
I think so.

01:08:57.279 --> 01:08:59.850
But one never knows what he's thinking.

01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:04.201
My brother died in Greece,
during the war.

01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:08.564
He was buried there,
so I often come here to pray for him.

01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:11.206
It consoles me a little.

01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:21.246
I pray for something else, too.

01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:23.931
I want so much...

01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:27.761
I want so much to have a child.
You understand me, don't you?

01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:29.848
Yes.

01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:03.729
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:05.171
- Oh, good morning.
- Morning.

01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:06.850
See you later.

01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:09.531
- I see you took the car.
- I didn't know you needed it.

01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:11.290
Well, you might have asked.

01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:13.289
I didn't want to wake you up.
And I was in a hurry.

01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:15.164
Why? What could possibly be so urgent?

01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:17.123
Another ruin, immortalised by Charles?

01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:19.163
I'm getting thoroughly
sick of these love...

01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:21.681
How can you make such a fuss,
just because I took the car?

01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:24.770
It's not only that. Everything you do
nowadays seems so utterly senseless.

01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:26.450
You've become quite intolerable.

01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:29.126
All right, then, if that's the way you feel,
let's do something about it.

01:12:29.240 --> 01:12:32.050
All right. Let's get a divorce.

01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:33.207
Good morning!

01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:36.045
I've come to pick you up.

01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:38.606
We should be leaving
for Pompeii immediately.

01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:40.890
Oh, well that's impossible. I...

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:42.968
Oh, but you can't miss this.
It's a special occasion.

01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:46.084
Something that's happened very rarely
since they've been excavating at Pompeii.

01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:48.601
They're going to make a cast
of the hollow place

01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:50.643
that has been left in the lava
by a human body!

01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:52.842
- I'm sorry, but we...
- Oh, please, you must come.

01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:56.043
Imagine that you actually see the shape
of a man just as he was then,

01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:58.162
the moment he was surprised by death.

01:12:58.280 --> 01:12:59.691
It's an extraordinary experience.

01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:01.529
Very few people
ever get a chance to see it.

01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:05.929
I must insist. I'm sure that you'll...
you'll thank me for it afterwards.

01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:13.128
All these are new excavations.

01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:37.730
It's on this spot
that they found a hollow space.

01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:43.006
When the men find hollow ground,
they make a number of holes,

01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:45.407
and through these, they pour plaster.

01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:48.211
The plaster fills out the hollow space
left in the ground by the body

01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:50.641
which has disintegrated.

01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:54.644
The shapes of bodies or objects
buried for over 2,000 years

01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:56.091
are reconstructed this way.

01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:07.568
Look, you can begin to see something!

01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:09.364
What is it?

01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:12.365
Let's see.

01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:15.129
It looks like a leg.

01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:19.167
Yes.

01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:23.884
There's an arm.

01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:26.929
And there are two more legs.

01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:31.290
Well...

01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:34.285
it must be a group.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.970
In the house of Menandro,
they found the remains of nine people.

01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:54.809
There's the head.

01:14:54.920 --> 01:14:57.844
You can see the skull
with the plaster clinging to it.

01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:18.246
And now the skull bones and the teeth,
both remarkably well-preserved.

01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:25.843
Two people, just as they were
at the moment they died.

01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:27.644
A man and a woman.

01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:29.646
A man and a woman.

01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:36.288
Perhaps husband and wife. Who knows?

01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:40.325
May have found death like this together.

01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:46.604
- What's happened to Mrs Joyce?
- I don't know.

01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:49.929
- Is there anything I can do?
- No, I'll talk to her.

01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:56.084
Catherine! What's the matter?
What's happened to you?

01:15:57.560 --> 01:16:00.723
Oh, Alex, this is too much.
I can't stand it anymore.

01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:02.569
Please take me home. I want to go home.

01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:04.728
I don't want to stay here any longer.

01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:07.283
Well, if that's what you want, but...

01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:09.926
We can't really
leave these people like this.

01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:12.850
They've been very kind,
and this isn't something they do every day.

01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:14.530
We owe them some kind of explanation.

01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:17.450
Well, you explain to them.
Say I'm sick or something.

01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:19.329
All right.

01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:22.604
Look, my life isn't feeling very well.

01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:24.722
If you'll excuse us,
I think I'll take her home.

01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:27.650
Oh, I'm terribly sorry. Do you want me
to show you the way out,

01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:29.649
or take you somewhere
where she can rest?

01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:30.807
Come, I'll show you.

01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:32.285
No, no. It's better if I go myself.

01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:35.131
She doesn't want anyone around
just at the moment, if you understand.

01:16:35.240 --> 01:16:38.528
But she'll be all right, and we'll probably
be back in a few minutes.

01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:40.563
All right.

01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:48.130
- Is this the way out?
- Yes, that's right.

01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:28.121
You know, I understand how you feel.

01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:30.891
I was pretty moved myself.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:32.923
But you must try
to pull yourself together.

01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:35.964
Oh, did it affect you the same way?

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.844
I... I've seen so many
strange things today

01:17:41.960 --> 01:17:44.804
that I didn't have the time
to tell you about.

01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:48.925
There are many things
that I didn't tell you.

01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:00.841
I'm sorry I answered you
in such a stupid way

01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:03.440
when I came back this morning.

01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:04.931
Why?

01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:07.042
Our situation is quite clear.

01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:09.003
We've made our decision.

01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:11.282
You don't have to make any excuses.

01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:24.722
Don't you want to look around a little,
as long as we're here?

01:18:24.840 --> 01:18:26.604
No.

01:18:34.040 --> 01:18:36.042
Nothing here that brings back
old memories?

01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:40.165
Oh, stop it! Must you continue to...
to harp on it?

01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:43.524
I'm sick and tired of your sarcasm.

01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:46.689
We have decided
to get a divorce and that settles it.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.287
Life is so short!

01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:15.971
That's why one should make
the most of it.

01:20:54.760 --> 01:20:56.364
Look, I've been thinking.

01:20:56.520 --> 01:20:58.568
Perhaps I ought to leave immediately.

01:20:58.680 --> 01:21:02.127
You seem to like it here, so why don't you
stay on until you've sold the house?

01:21:02.240 --> 01:21:04.242
I'll take the plane back to London.

01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:07.728
I think the best thing to do is to
talk to a lawyer and start proceedings.

01:21:09.720 --> 01:21:12.963
Maybe what is wrong
with our marriage is that we...

01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:14.605
we didn't have a child.

01:21:15.720 --> 01:21:17.768
Well, you didn't want a child.

01:21:17.880 --> 01:21:19.803
And now I agree with you.

01:21:19.920 --> 01:21:22.890
You were quite right.
You had much more foresight than I did.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:27.163
Imagine what it would be like
to have a child involved in this.

01:21:28.240 --> 01:21:30.811
It would make the divorce
even more painful.

01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:33.524
Painful?

01:21:33.640 --> 01:21:36.371
Is it going to be painful for you?

01:21:36.520 --> 01:21:39.171
Well... more complicated.

01:22:04.840 --> 01:22:07.525
What in the world is going on?

01:22:07.640 --> 01:22:11.042
Look at all these people.
Look at the children.

01:22:15.800 --> 01:22:20.010
Ah, this is awful.
We won't get through for hours.

01:22:23.680 --> 01:22:25.330
Alex, listen.

01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:28.125
Are you sure
we're doing the right thing?

01:22:28.240 --> 01:22:31.130
Are you suddenly getting sentimental?

01:22:31.240 --> 01:22:34.005
Listen, Cathy, we've been honest
with each other up till now.

01:22:34.120 --> 01:22:35.690
Don't let's spoil everything.

01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:50.882
How can they believe in that?

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.162
They're like a bunch of children.

01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:55.929
Children are happy.

01:23:59.160 --> 01:24:02.403
Alex, I don't want you to hate me.
I don't want it to finish this way.

01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:05.882
Oh, Cathy. What are you driving at?
What game are you trying to play?

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.048
You've never understood me.
You've never even tried.

01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:10.606
And now this nonsense.
What is it you want?

01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:12.768
Nothing. I despise you.

01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:15.451
Well, come on.
Let's get out of this crowd.

01:24:17.640 --> 01:24:19.881
A miracle! It was a miracle!

01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:24.288
Alex! Alex! Alex!

01:24:28.560 --> 01:24:30.050
Alex!

01:24:44.200 --> 01:24:47.841
- Alex, I don't want to lose you!
- Catherine.

01:25:01.760 --> 01:25:03.967
Catherine, what's wrong with us?

01:25:04.080 --> 01:25:05.650
Why do we torture one another?

01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:09.003
When you say things that hurt me,
I... try to hurt you back, don't you see?

01:25:09.120 --> 01:25:12.169
But I can't, I can't any longer,
because I love you.

01:25:12.280 --> 01:25:14.248
Perhaps we get hurt too easily.

01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:16.283
Tell me that you love me.

01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:19.563
Well, if I do, will you promise
not to take advantage of me?

01:25:20.760 --> 01:25:24.526
Yes. But tell me.
I want to hear you say it.

01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:26.563
All right. I love you.
