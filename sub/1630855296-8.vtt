00:06.006 --> 00:07.966
["No Sleep" by CHILDREN playing]

00:11.511 --> 00:14.764
[McEnroe] It was almost time for Princeton
to announce its decision,

00:14.848 --> 00:17.225
and Devi was feeling eerily calm.

00:17.308 --> 00:18.810
Maybe it was because she'd done

00:18.893 --> 00:21.479
everything humanly possible
to help her chances.

00:21.563 --> 00:23.773
All right, boys, make us proud out there.

00:23.857 --> 00:26.651
[McEnroe] Or maybe it was because
she'd matured a little.

00:26.735 --> 00:27.944
Did you actually apply to Yale?

00:28.028 --> 00:32.490
[McEnroe] Her fight with Fabiola had been
kind of a wake-up call about her temper.

00:32.574 --> 00:34.492
And her letting go of Paxton

00:34.576 --> 00:38.580
proved that she'd evolved
beyond the desperate nerd she once was.

00:39.122 --> 00:40.123
[phone chimes]

00:40.206 --> 00:41.833
But maybe she was just calm

00:41.916 --> 00:44.461
because she was distracted
by something else.

00:44.544 --> 00:45.587
[phone chimes]

00:45.670 --> 00:48.131
You see, last week, this went down.

00:49.466 --> 00:50.550
[Ben] What are you doing?

00:50.633 --> 00:51.718
[McEnroe] Oh, baby.

00:51.801 --> 00:54.220
This may not look like much to an adult,

00:54.304 --> 00:57.057
but an unsolicited
"what are you doing" text

00:57.140 --> 01:00.226
at 11 p.m. from a boy was pretty loaded.

01:00.310 --> 01:03.772
Especially a boy
who hasn't texted you in almost a year.

01:04.272 --> 01:05.398
Hmm.

01:05.482 --> 01:07.901
[McEnroe] And they'd been texting
every day since.

01:07.984 --> 01:09.652
[Ben] Saw this and thought of you.

01:10.236 --> 01:13.448
[McEnroe] As a man who's signed
his fair share of women's chests,

01:13.531 --> 01:15.325
I know flirting when I see it.

01:16.034 --> 01:16.910
Hmm.

01:16.993 --> 01:18.620
[indistinct chatter]

01:18.703 --> 01:20.622
[McEnroe] And I see it right now
in the kitchen.

01:20.705 --> 01:23.666
[indistinct chatter]

01:24.250 --> 01:26.002
[McEnroe] Wait, was that an arm touch?

01:27.545 --> 01:28.797
[speaking indistinctly]

01:29.464 --> 01:30.840
[McEnroe] And a hair tuck?

01:31.424 --> 01:32.467
Stop it.

01:32.550 --> 01:33.968
[McEnroe] A playful slap?

01:34.052 --> 01:38.389
Holy shit, did Devi's mom
have a crush on Margot's dad?

01:38.473 --> 01:40.100
What the hell's going on here?

01:40.183 --> 01:42.644
["Haunted" by Equateur playing]

01:45.897 --> 01:48.608
Devi drifted through the day in a daze,

01:48.691 --> 01:51.820
trying to process
the sight of her mom down bad

01:51.903 --> 01:54.572
for that Property Brother-looking ass.

01:54.656 --> 01:58.076
She assumed any minute
she would go absolutely batshit

01:58.159 --> 02:01.204
over her mom fraternizing
with her enemy's kin.

02:01.287 --> 02:04.999
But as the day wore on,
no insane reaction came,

02:05.083 --> 02:06.417
and Devi realized…

02:06.501 --> 02:07.710
I think I'm cool with it.

02:07.794 --> 02:10.547
Like, initially,
I was kind of freaked out,

02:10.630 --> 02:13.216
but I was thinking about it,
and I feel like I wanna do--

02:14.134 --> 02:16.803
[exhales sharply] What's that word
opposite of sabotage?

02:16.886 --> 02:18.346
You mean help?

02:18.429 --> 02:20.932
Yes, that's it.
I wanna help my mom get him.

02:21.015 --> 02:25.061
You know, I just don't want her
to be all alone after I'm gone next year.

02:25.145 --> 02:28.148
I'm moving on to a cool new life
and so should she.

02:28.231 --> 02:30.525
I get it. My parents can't survive
without each other.

02:30.608 --> 02:33.403
[inhales deeply] It takes two of them
to clip my dad into the Peloton.

02:33.486 --> 02:36.364
I don't know what he's gonna do
when we go look at colleges this weekend.

02:36.447 --> 02:38.116
Oh. You're looking at other colleges?

02:38.199 --> 02:39.909
Just to make sure
Princeton's the best fit,

02:39.993 --> 02:40.910
which it probably is.

02:40.994 --> 02:44.080
So don't worry, we'll still be roomies.
Oh, and also prom dates.

02:44.164 --> 02:46.541
I was talking to Addison,
and they'll be out of town for prom,

02:46.624 --> 02:48.626
so I thought the three of us
could go together.

02:48.710 --> 02:50.170
[Devi gasps] Yes! I love that.

02:50.253 --> 02:53.214
I mean, you two are the best relationship
I've had in high school.

02:53.298 --> 02:56.551
-So it's only fitting that we go together.
-I know. Eleanor, are you in?

02:56.634 --> 02:57.760
Huh? Uh…

02:58.303 --> 02:59.470
I agree with Devi.

03:00.388 --> 03:02.640
-She said something, right?
-Eleanor, come on.

03:02.724 --> 03:04.142
We're talking about prom.

03:04.225 --> 03:06.269
We hardly ever get to see you now,

03:06.352 --> 03:08.438
and when we do,
you're always so distracted.

03:08.521 --> 03:10.148
I know. I'm sorry.

03:10.231 --> 03:13.026
I'm just reading the script
for the movie I'm working on tomorrow.

03:13.109 --> 03:14.861
-Oh.
-Did you get a line this time?

03:14.944 --> 03:19.782
No, but I heard that one of the extras
might get to be a corpse on the poster.

03:19.866 --> 03:21.576
Well, that sounds cool.

03:22.160 --> 03:23.786
So what about going to prom with us?

03:23.870 --> 03:25.830
I mean, this is gonna be
the last high school thing

03:25.914 --> 03:26.956
that we get to do together.

03:27.040 --> 03:30.668
I know, but my agent
really wants me to network.

03:30.752 --> 03:33.004
The producers on this movie
I'm doing tomorrow night

03:33.087 --> 03:36.633
are also the producers
for the new marble movie.

03:36.716 --> 03:38.343
Oh, you mean Marvel movie.

03:38.426 --> 03:40.595
No, it's a movie about marbles.

03:41.179 --> 03:45.516
But maybe they'll see me and think,
"Hey, that corpse has something special."

03:46.100 --> 03:48.478
So I just can't commit to prom right now.

03:49.062 --> 03:50.063
Hmm.

03:50.146 --> 03:52.649
[gentle music playing]

03:52.732 --> 03:55.318
Okay, Nirmala Mami,
tomorrow we're taking care of you.

03:55.401 --> 03:57.695
So what would you like to do
for your birthday dinner?

03:57.779 --> 04:00.114
Oh, I'm a simple woman. I don't need much,

04:00.198 --> 04:02.450
just my family and loved ones,

04:02.533 --> 04:05.411
and maybe a catered dinner
from a Michelin-star restaurant.

04:05.495 --> 04:07.455
-Wow, only that?
-[Nirmala] Yes.

04:07.538 --> 04:11.000
But don't worry about dessert
because Len is taking care of it.

04:11.084 --> 04:12.043
[Devi] Hmm.

04:12.126 --> 04:14.504
Well, I'm off to call Verizon
about a rebate.

04:14.587 --> 04:16.756
There's no better way to end the day.

04:18.049 --> 04:21.219
Everyone be warned, Len is definitely
planning to bake a cake himself.

04:21.302 --> 04:25.223
Kamala, how do you know that Len
is planning to bake a cake by himself?

04:25.306 --> 04:27.809
[whispering] You're not still
following him around, are you?

04:28.518 --> 04:29.769
-Maybe?
-Kamala.

04:29.852 --> 04:32.480
Okay, well, you would follow him
around too, if you saw what I saw.

04:32.563 --> 04:35.400
Ooh, you mean when he was F-boying around
with that Eurotrash thot?

04:35.483 --> 04:36.401
[Nalini] Devi.

04:37.026 --> 04:38.319
I don't know what you just said,

04:38.403 --> 04:40.822
but I believe it is language
I do not want in this house.

04:40.905 --> 04:42.282
Let me talk to your cousin.

04:44.701 --> 04:48.496
I swear he is hatching a plan
with his mistress to steal Pati's money.

04:48.579 --> 04:49.831
If Len were a con man,

04:49.914 --> 04:52.083
you would have found something out,
and you haven't.

04:52.166 --> 04:54.585
But I just know that he's up to something.

04:54.669 --> 04:56.212
And Pati's too trusting.

04:56.296 --> 04:58.840
She writes back
to every piece of spam that she gets.

04:58.923 --> 05:02.302
How are you remotely keeping up
with your research with all this going on?

05:03.594 --> 05:04.846
I'm a little behind.

05:04.929 --> 05:08.391
Come on.
You really have to let this Len stuff go.

05:08.474 --> 05:10.018
[somber music playing]

05:10.101 --> 05:11.185
[sighs]

05:11.853 --> 05:12.979
[knocking]

05:13.563 --> 05:17.233
So Margot's dad has done
quite a bit of work around the house.

05:17.317 --> 05:20.069
It's almost as if
once one project is done,

05:20.153 --> 05:22.363
you happen to find another one for him.

05:23.239 --> 05:24.866
What are you getting at, Devi?

05:24.949 --> 05:26.909
I just wanted to let you know

05:27.410 --> 05:30.788
that if you happen to have a crush on him,
I'd be cool with it.

05:30.872 --> 05:32.623
What? I'm a grown woman.

05:32.707 --> 05:34.917
The only things I crush
are garlic and the crossword.

05:35.001 --> 05:37.503
Are you sure? I mean,
I heard a lot of giggling this morning.

05:37.587 --> 05:40.131
-Just admit it, you like him.
-I do not.

05:40.214 --> 05:42.383
Mom, you do, and you should ask him out.

05:42.467 --> 05:46.262
[laughs] For heaven's sake, Devi,
I'm not gonna ask him out.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.139
Just invite him to Pati's birthday dinner.

05:48.222 --> 05:51.559
It's barely romantic. He'll probably
end up finding her teeth in a napkin.

05:51.642 --> 05:53.269
Come on, Mom. You know you want to.

05:54.312 --> 05:55.855
-Fine.
-Yay!

05:56.439 --> 05:57.982
I guess it's not a horrible idea

05:58.066 --> 06:00.401
to invite a nice man
to a respectable family dinner.

06:00.485 --> 06:02.195
Great. Okay, so should we text him now?

06:02.278 --> 06:04.572
Chi. 9 p.m.

06:04.655 --> 06:06.824
You think I'm some
Jennifer Coolidge character?

06:07.575 --> 06:09.535
I'll just talk to him in the morning.

06:10.119 --> 06:11.037
-[Devi] Okay.
-Out.

06:11.120 --> 06:12.955
[pleasant music playing]

06:15.541 --> 06:16.834
[Devi] Oh my God. Mom, he's here.

06:16.918 --> 06:19.212
-Okay.
-[Devi] Mom, come here.

06:19.295 --> 06:22.006
Wait, hold on. Devi, what are you--
What are you doing?

06:22.090 --> 06:24.884
We are playing to your strengths, Mom.
Take it as a compliment.

06:24.967 --> 06:27.428
And let those slut strands breathe.

06:27.512 --> 06:30.515
Will you just get out of here?
And… And don't listen, okay?

06:31.641 --> 06:33.142
-[Nalini sighs]
-Hmm.

06:34.143 --> 06:37.063
-Andres, hello. Hi.
-[Andres] Hi. Hi.

06:37.146 --> 06:39.649
You look-- Are you going somewhere?

06:39.732 --> 06:43.277
No. No. I mean, yes, I--
I gotta work. [laughs]

06:43.361 --> 06:44.821
-[chuckles]
-Um…

06:44.904 --> 06:47.198
But before I leave, I was just, um…

06:47.281 --> 06:49.409
I was wondering
what you were doing tonight.

06:49.492 --> 06:52.829
Um, we're just having
a birthday dinner for Nirmala,

06:52.912 --> 06:56.499
and it is absolutely nothing fancy,
but I was just, um…

06:57.583 --> 06:59.127
May-- Maybe you'd like to come?

07:00.294 --> 07:01.212
Oh.

07:01.879 --> 07:04.006
-I'd love to come to dinner.
-Okay, good.

07:05.258 --> 07:08.553
But… I'm not sure I should.

07:10.471 --> 07:14.851
[sighs] You know the situation
with our daughters is… complicated,

07:14.934 --> 07:16.769
and Margot understands me working here,

07:16.853 --> 07:20.815
but I'm not sure if she'd be okay
with anything more than that.

07:20.898 --> 07:21.816
Mmm.

07:23.568 --> 07:25.862
-I'm sorry.
-Oh my goodness, it's okay.

07:25.945 --> 07:27.530
It was a silly idea.

07:27.613 --> 07:31.826
[McEnroe] And with that, Devi knew she
had to find a way to make up with Margot.

07:32.368 --> 07:34.954
But how do you win over someone
who detests you?

07:35.455 --> 07:36.998
Probably by just being yourself--

07:37.081 --> 07:39.750
Hey, girl. What's good?

07:40.668 --> 07:44.005
-Uh, okay, sorry. Uh, let me start over.
-What do you want, Devi?

07:45.173 --> 07:48.050
I know we had our issues back in the fall,

07:48.134 --> 07:49.677
but we're cool now, right?

07:49.760 --> 07:52.096
No, I deeply hate you
and think you're a bad person.

07:52.180 --> 07:53.639
But what about your dad?

07:54.265 --> 07:55.266
You love him, right?

07:56.058 --> 07:57.059
Are you feeling okay?

07:57.143 --> 07:59.228
Yeah. Yeah. Never better.

07:59.312 --> 08:03.399
I just think that my mom and your dad
might make a cute couple.

08:04.233 --> 08:05.318
I doubt it.

08:05.401 --> 08:10.281
My dad mostly dates, like, yoga teachers,
aestheticians, flight attendants.

08:10.364 --> 08:13.201
-You get what I'm saying.
-Uh-- My mom is very hot.

08:13.284 --> 08:15.620
The greeter at Costco
winks at her every time we go.

08:15.703 --> 08:17.997
And I think that your dad
would be into her

08:18.080 --> 08:19.540
if he thought you and I were friends.

08:19.624 --> 08:21.501
Well, we're definitely not friends,

08:21.584 --> 08:23.753
and I don't really want my dad
to date your mom.

08:23.836 --> 08:25.671
But my mom isn't me.

08:25.755 --> 08:28.174
She's a completely reasonable
super smart doctor.

08:28.257 --> 08:29.926
And when you go off to school,

08:30.009 --> 08:33.346
do you want your dad
to just be sad and lonely,

08:33.930 --> 08:36.849
falling asleep every night
on his La-Z-Boy?

08:40.061 --> 08:42.563
[sighs] I'll even throw in some In-N-Out
to sweeten the deal.

08:42.647 --> 08:43.940
[exhales]

08:45.816 --> 08:47.193
Fine.

08:47.276 --> 08:48.694
But I want a shake too.

08:48.778 --> 08:49.946
[inhales] Mmm.

08:50.029 --> 08:52.740
Alrighty, sista--

08:52.823 --> 08:53.991
No?

08:54.075 --> 08:55.034
No.

08:56.160 --> 08:58.579
Yo, Big Ben. Can I sit?

08:58.663 --> 09:00.790
-Uh, sure.
-Sweet.

09:01.791 --> 09:02.833
[wrapper rustling]

09:10.299 --> 09:11.217
Mmm.

09:11.300 --> 09:12.969
[chomping] Mmm.

09:13.052 --> 09:16.055
Pardon my interruption, but why are you
even doing homework anyway?

09:16.138 --> 09:17.682
Didn't you get into some good school?

09:17.765 --> 09:19.850
Yeah, but I still have to do
my assignments.

09:20.476 --> 09:22.353
-Why?
-Because I have to.

09:22.436 --> 09:25.314
If I let my grades slip,
Columbia might take back my acceptance.

09:25.398 --> 09:26.566
No, that's a myth.

09:26.649 --> 09:28.526
-No, it's not.
-[Trent] Yeah, it is.

09:28.609 --> 09:29.944
You think admissions officers

09:30.027 --> 09:32.530
are double-checking the grades
of over 1,000 kids?

09:32.613 --> 09:34.365
No, they're on vacation, baby.

09:34.448 --> 09:36.325
And you know who else needs a break?

09:36.409 --> 09:38.578
You, my nerdy little homie.

09:38.661 --> 09:40.746
I wouldn't even know
what to do with a break.

09:41.247 --> 09:43.332
I'm not, like, a chill person.

I mean, that's everything.

10:12.194 --> 10:13.446
What are you doing here?

10:14.280 --> 10:19.243
I'm, uh… hanging out…
hanging out with Devi.

10:19.744 --> 10:21.078
[blows raspberry]

10:21.162 --> 10:22.747
What? Really?

10:22.830 --> 10:25.082
Yup. We are friends now.

10:25.750 --> 10:26.917
[Margot] Mm-hmm.

10:27.710 --> 10:31.005
And I was thinking maybe
she could come to Pati's dinner tonight?

10:31.088 --> 10:34.300
[gasps] Oh my God, Mr. Ramos,
you should come too.

10:34.884 --> 10:37.094
Oh no, no. No, actually, he cannot come--

10:37.178 --> 10:39.847
Actually, I… I'd love to.

[Ben] Dude, send me that TikTok
of the shark dancing on the stripper pole.

10:53.778 --> 10:55.946
All right, everyone. Here you go.

10:56.030 --> 10:57.156
Dinner is served.

10:57.239 --> 10:58.366
Please dig in.

10:58.449 --> 10:59.617
I'll take that.

11:00.368 --> 11:03.162
Pati, Manish sent these for you.
He apologizes for missing your dinner.

11:03.245 --> 11:06.874
Ooh, Godiva Seashell Collection.

11:06.957 --> 11:08.542
It will hurt to regift this one.

Thank you all
for letting us join you this evening.

11:11.796 --> 11:12.630

11:12.713 --> 11:14.840
This is actually
the longest job I've ever done.

11:14.924 --> 11:16.258
-Hmm.
-[Kamala chuckles]

11:16.342 --> 11:18.761
But it's also been my favorite.

11:25.393 --> 11:26.227
[chiming stops]

11:26.310 --> 11:30.356
Uh, so, Devi and Margot,
how did you two make up?

11:30.439 --> 11:31.357
Ah…

11:32.358 --> 11:36.153
Well, we realized
that our little misunderstanding earlier

11:36.237 --> 11:37.738
was just silly, you know?

11:37.822 --> 11:38.781
Hmm.

11:38.864 --> 11:42.702
Yeah, I… I also thought it was silly
how I almost got kicked out of school,

11:42.785 --> 11:43.994
so I just told Devi,

11:44.078 --> 11:47.081
"Sure, I forgive you
for being such a reckless psycho."

11:47.164 --> 11:51.252
[chuckles] And that is how we are friends,
and we both like it.

-[Len sighs]

11:58.008 --> 12:01.303
Len, it seems like someone's
trying to call you. You should pick it up.

12:01.387 --> 12:04.890
I don't wanna distract
from Nirmy's special day,

12:04.974 --> 12:07.184
so I'm gonna take it upstairs.

12:10.020 --> 12:12.481
Wow. That is a real loud ringtone.

12:12.565 --> 12:15.443
Ugh. Just be happy he changed it
from "why you gotta be so rude?"

12:15.526 --> 12:18.654
-No, that sucks.
-Mm-hmm. [laughs]

12:18.738 --> 12:20.865
You know what? I also have to go upstairs.

12:20.948 --> 12:22.658
To use the washroom.

12:22.742 --> 12:24.702
You can hear everything downstairs.

12:26.120 --> 12:28.748
IBS runs rampant in our family.

12:29.331 --> 12:30.499
Oh.

12:31.292 --> 12:32.918
[whispering] Is everything all right?

12:34.420 --> 12:35.796
I can't talk right now.

12:35.880 --> 12:37.673
It's Nirmala's birthday dinner.

12:38.257 --> 12:40.217
Of course you can't come here.

12:40.301 --> 12:43.929
We gotta stick to the plan
and wait till after the wedding,

12:44.013 --> 12:45.264
or we're gonna blow it.

12:45.347 --> 12:47.475
They're already getting suspicious.

12:47.975 --> 12:50.603
[suspicious music playing]

12:52.813 --> 12:54.648
Hello. Eleanor Wong.

12:54.732 --> 12:57.276
Featured background.
Shall I report to hair and makeup?

12:57.359 --> 12:59.487
Uh… no, you can have a seat.

12:59.570 --> 13:02.239
We'll call you when it's time
to be laser-beamed to death by aliens.

13:02.323 --> 13:03.324
Thank you.

13:03.407 --> 13:04.241
[woman] Eleanor?

13:07.953 --> 13:08.788
[exhales]

13:09.371 --> 13:10.372
Mom?

13:10.456 --> 13:13.793
[McEnroe] Now, as you may remember,
the last time Eleanor saw her mom,

13:13.876 --> 13:16.295
she abandoned her
and left her in shambles.

13:16.879 --> 13:20.841
Since then, there had only been
a few phone calls and texts between them.

13:21.675 --> 13:26.222
Well, and also one invitation
for Eleanor to be on Joyce's podcast,

13:26.305 --> 13:27.640
The Joyce of Acting.

13:27.723 --> 13:29.809
Wow. You're back in town.

13:29.892 --> 13:31.101
I am.

13:31.185 --> 13:32.394
Uh, for a minute.

13:32.478 --> 13:34.522
I was just about to call you. [chuckles]

13:34.605 --> 13:36.023
So how are you, sweetie?

13:36.607 --> 13:39.401
Uh, I'm actually doing great.

13:39.485 --> 13:42.196
I graduated early,
and now I'm acting full-time.

13:42.279 --> 13:44.031
Ooh, following in my footsteps.

13:45.032 --> 13:47.076
But maybe now that you're
acting professionally,

13:47.159 --> 13:49.620
you'll see why I've done
some of the things I've done.

13:49.703 --> 13:52.540
You mean how you flaked on me
my whole life?

13:52.623 --> 13:53.958
Oh, honey.

13:54.625 --> 13:57.670
I know I upset you
the last time we saw each other,

13:57.753 --> 13:59.713
and I am so sorry about that.

14:00.297 --> 14:01.966
It's just that when you're an actor,

14:02.049 --> 14:04.760
you don't have control
of where or when you're gonna work next.

14:04.844 --> 14:07.680
But if you stick to it long enough,
you'll get your big break.

14:08.264 --> 14:11.892
For instance, I booked
my first national commercial last week.

14:12.476 --> 14:14.937
I play "depressed woman
at fun pool party."

14:15.020 --> 14:15.896
[scoffs]

14:16.689 --> 14:18.107
Congratulations, Mom.

14:19.942 --> 14:22.736
Hey, I need someone to be a corpse
for our publicity stills.

14:22.820 --> 14:24.864
I played dead three times in SVU.

14:25.656 --> 14:28.868
[McEnroe] As Eleanor saw the desperation
in her mother's face

14:28.951 --> 14:31.245
to play a dead body on a poster,

14:31.328 --> 14:33.163
she was filled with deep pity.

14:33.664 --> 14:34.874
Okay, fine. You.

14:34.957 --> 14:36.208
[exhales]

14:36.292 --> 14:38.544
[sentimental music playing]

14:40.629 --> 14:43.507
You know what? Actually,
I think my daughter should do it.

14:45.009 --> 14:46.760
Yeah, I don't care who it is.

14:47.386 --> 14:49.096
It's okay, Mom. You take it.

14:50.014 --> 14:51.015
You sure?

14:51.098 --> 14:53.434
[music continues]

15:00.900 --> 15:03.193
[Andres laughing]

15:03.277 --> 15:05.070
I think your scheme is working.

15:05.154 --> 15:06.447
Your mom just listened to my dad

15:06.530 --> 15:09.033
describe an entire episode
of Yellowstone in detail.

15:09.116 --> 15:10.826
I know. And normally, she's like,

15:10.910 --> 15:13.537
"serialized TV
is for society's laziest workers."

15:14.121 --> 15:16.790
Tonight hasn't been as annoying
as I thought it would be.

15:16.874 --> 15:20.419
Like, if Ben didn't exist,
I could see us being friends.

15:20.502 --> 15:21.670
Me too.

15:21.754 --> 15:25.049
But hey, you gotta give it to him.
He's got great taste in girlfriends.

-Uh, Ben just texted me.

15:32.890 --> 15:35.100
Oh. You guys still text?

15:35.184 --> 15:37.102
Yeah, it's kind of random.

15:37.186 --> 15:39.563
He just started texting me
out of nowhere recently.

15:39.647 --> 15:42.107
[McEnroe] Little fancy boy did what now?

15:42.191 --> 15:44.568
Sorry, is… is this weird to talk about? I…

15:44.652 --> 15:47.696
No, no, no, not weird at all.
Ben and I are just friends.

15:47.780 --> 15:49.239
Yeah. [chuckles]

15:49.323 --> 15:52.576
Yeah, I assumed so
'cause if you were gonna get together,

15:52.660 --> 15:54.912
you probably would've done it
right after we broke up.

15:54.995 --> 15:56.205
Right. [chuckles]

15:56.288 --> 15:59.917
'Cause that's when that would happen,
if it were going to.

16:02.836 --> 16:04.630
So, what's the deal with you guys?

16:04.713 --> 16:07.216
[McEnroe] Ah! A teen girl classic,

16:07.800 --> 16:11.345
pretending to not be interested
in the person you're interested in

16:11.428 --> 16:15.891
to find out if he's actually interested
in the other girl interested in him.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.685
I don't know. [sighs]

16:17.768 --> 16:19.937
I guess I still have some feelings,

16:20.020 --> 16:22.982
but I can't tell from his texts
what he's thinking.

16:23.065 --> 16:26.068
Maybe if you showed it to me,
I can help you figure it out.

16:26.151 --> 16:29.530
[McEnroe] While Ben had been texting Devi
about stripping sharks,

16:29.613 --> 16:33.033
he'd been asking Margot
about her hopes and dreams

16:33.117 --> 16:34.743
and hearting all her texts.

16:34.827 --> 16:36.787
Sure, he was texting them both,

16:36.870 --> 16:39.248
but Devi was clearly in the friend zone.

16:39.331 --> 16:42.084
Yeah, it seems like
the feelings are mutual.

16:42.668 --> 16:43.502
Really?

16:43.585 --> 16:47.047
Margot, you're our guest.
You should relax. I'll help Devi tidy up.

16:47.131 --> 16:49.258
-Oh, uh, I don't mind--
-Go sit.

16:52.136 --> 16:54.513
Are you okay?
Your eyes are seriously bugging out.

16:54.596 --> 16:56.890

I need you to help break into it.

17:33.719 --> 17:35.429
Do you not feel anything?

17:35.512 --> 17:37.347
Maybe you have, like,
a super high tolerance.

17:37.431 --> 17:40.225
Hmm, that's not surprising.
I'm always really hydrated,

17:40.309 --> 17:43.395
and my personal trainer says
that I have less body fat than The Rock.

17:43.479 --> 17:45.355
Well, you could always eat another.

17:45.439 --> 17:47.024
There's no such thing as too high.

17:47.733 --> 17:48.567
Okay.

17:52.780 --> 17:54.698
So, what we do now?

17:54.782 --> 17:57.618
Well, some people
like to watch weird cartoons,

What are you doing here?

20:09.750 --> 20:14.755
[chuckles] Oh my God, I'm… I'm so dumb.
Is something going on between you two?

20:14.838 --> 20:17.216
Were you lying to me
when I stupidly opened up to you?

20:17.299 --> 20:20.719
No, no, no, Margot, I promise.
Ben and I are just friends.

20:20.802 --> 20:23.222
-Right, Ben?
-Uh… Um…

-[happy music playing]

20:33.732 --> 20:36.735
-[echoing] Then why is he holding flowers?
-I don't know.

20:36.818 --> 20:38.862
Is that, like, a present
for my grandmother?

20:40.906 --> 20:45.494
Okay. Look, Margot,
Ben and I are not remotely a thing.

20:45.577 --> 20:47.496
He's the one that said
we should never be together

20:47.579 --> 20:50.082
because we're both too insecure
and competitive.

20:50.165 --> 20:51.667
And he's right.

20:51.750 --> 20:54.294
He's too mean, and I'm too crazy.

20:54.378 --> 20:57.130
Together, we're just two otters
trying to dunk each other.

20:57.214 --> 20:58.548
Then what is he doing here?

20:58.632 --> 21:00.425
I have no idea.

21:00.509 --> 21:02.469
[echoing] Ben, why are you here?

21:04.221 --> 21:06.473
-Because I'm on drugs.
-What?

21:06.556 --> 21:07.599
[Len] Hey, hey, everybody.

21:07.683 --> 21:12.020
Be prepared to be amazed
by my gorgeous cake.

21:12.104 --> 21:13.105
Get it?

21:13.188 --> 21:15.315
Nirmy is the apple of my eye.

21:15.399 --> 21:17.693
Wouldn't this be more like
the eye of your apple?

21:17.776 --> 21:20.445

21:22.531 --> 21:23.824

Hey, man, what the--

21:29.705 --> 21:31.039
My cake.

21:31.123 --> 21:33.333
-Dude! [gasps]
-Oh. I'm… I'm so sorry.

21:33.417 --> 21:36.628
[woman] You should be.
That cake looked fabulous.

21:36.712 --> 21:37.671
Gyah.

21:38.922 --> 21:41.216
Can everyone else see the British woman?

21:41.300 --> 21:44.678
-I'm actually Australian.
-It's her. It's Len's other woman.

21:44.761 --> 21:48.432
What? That's not another woman.
That's our real estate agent.

21:48.515 --> 21:50.892
No, no, no, no. He calls her "baby."

21:50.976 --> 21:53.437
-[all groan]
-Oh, Baby's actually my given name.

21:53.520 --> 21:56.690
I was named after the lead character
in Dirty Dancing.

21:56.773 --> 21:58.400
My parents were quite stupid.

21:59.776 --> 22:02.362
I actually do think that
there's such a thing as too high.

22:03.405 --> 22:07.576
Dad, can we go?
This all just got a little too weird.

22:07.659 --> 22:08.660
Um… [sighs]

22:08.744 --> 22:09.828
Yeah. Okay, honey.

22:11.496 --> 22:13.957
Thank you all for… an interesting evening.

22:14.458 --> 22:16.251
Pleasure to meet you, Baby.

22:16.835 --> 22:17.753
Likewise.

22:17.836 --> 22:19.463
Can you please drop me off at home?

22:22.049 --> 22:25.677
Margot, wait. Please don't go.
Our lonely parents need this.

22:25.761 --> 22:26.845
[door closes]

22:28.096 --> 22:30.474
Okay, if she's your "real estate agent,"

22:30.557 --> 22:32.851
then why is she pressuring Len for money?

22:32.934 --> 22:35.604
For a down payment
on a family vacation condo.

22:35.687 --> 22:38.732
We were going to surprise everyone
with it at the wedding,

22:38.815 --> 22:40.442
but Baby's been a little pushy.

22:40.525 --> 22:42.819
Darling, places get snatched up,

22:42.903 --> 22:45.322
and to be honest,
I really need the commission.

22:45.405 --> 22:46.656
I'm deep in debt.

22:46.740 --> 22:48.825
What can I say? I love to play the ponies.

22:48.909 --> 22:52.537
Okay, well, this has been
a very exciting night.

22:52.621 --> 22:57.584
Uh, why don't we just clean up this mess
and say goodnight to Len and…

22:57.667 --> 22:59.127
-Baby.
-[Nalini] Baby. Uh-huh.

23:00.212 --> 23:02.047
Hey, Kamala… [sighs]

23:02.130 --> 23:07.052
I love your grandmother,
and I would never do anything to hurt her.

23:07.135 --> 23:09.679
I hope to convince you of that someday.

23:10.305 --> 23:12.307
[sentimental music playing]

23:14.101 --> 23:14.935
Bye.

23:17.312 --> 23:19.231
[crickets chirping]

23:21.525 --> 23:23.777
Well, tonight was certainly a strange one,

23:23.860 --> 23:26.279
and the running theme seemed to be

23:26.363 --> 23:28.907
that you two, however misguided,

23:29.616 --> 23:31.368
were trying to look out for us.

23:31.952 --> 23:33.829
Devi, you don't have to worry about me.

23:33.912 --> 23:36.623
I am going to be just fine when you leave.

23:36.706 --> 23:37.916
But… [sighs]

23:37.999 --> 23:40.669
…sometimes when I see you eating
a Lean Cuisine alone,

23:41.294 --> 23:42.129
I get sad.

23:42.212 --> 23:45.507
Oh, don't be. Microwave fettuccine Alfredo
brings me nothing but joy.

23:45.590 --> 23:48.427
-Oh.
-And you know what else brings me joy?

23:48.927 --> 23:50.512
That you're okay with me dating.

23:51.304 --> 23:53.432
Because you don't wanna die
without hitting it again?

23:53.515 --> 23:54.933
Oh God, no.

23:56.101 --> 23:58.311
We were just trapped
in that dark place for so long,

23:58.395 --> 24:01.440
and this all made me realize
that we're coming out of it.

24:02.566 --> 24:04.860
Although, I don't think
I'll be moving on with Andres.

24:04.943 --> 24:08.196
I heard his tires screech
as he peeled out of the driveway.

24:08.280 --> 24:11.158
Hmm. And now, Kamala,
should we be worried?

24:12.409 --> 24:14.536
No. I'm sorry.

24:14.619 --> 24:17.164
I just really thought
that Len was a con man.

24:17.247 --> 24:18.957
[tsks] Len's no con man.

24:19.040 --> 24:21.793
He does not have
the organizational skills to con.

24:21.877 --> 24:24.296
He keeps all his files
in his guest bathtub.

24:24.379 --> 24:26.256
What is this really about, Kamala?

24:27.340 --> 24:28.425
I don't know.

24:30.552 --> 24:32.762
I turned down
this incredible job recently,

24:32.846 --> 24:35.015
and maybe this is
all just me distracting myself

24:35.098 --> 24:36.475
from feeling regret about it.

24:36.558 --> 24:38.435
And why did you turn this job down?

24:38.518 --> 24:42.105
Because it's in Baltimore,
and I can't move to Baltimore.

24:42.189 --> 24:44.024
I've never lived without family.

24:44.107 --> 24:46.234
I mean, I think Manish would come,

24:46.318 --> 24:49.738
but this little family unit
has become particularly precious to me.

24:52.866 --> 24:55.327
[Nalini] But we are always here for you.

24:56.077 --> 24:57.704
And if you're feeling enough regret

24:57.787 --> 24:59.789
to pull the sting operation
you did tonight,

24:59.873 --> 25:02.167
then maybe you need to take this job.

25:02.250 --> 25:04.669
And hey, you can always visit me.

25:04.753 --> 25:06.379
I'll probably be up the coast.

25:06.463 --> 25:09.216
You can get a new ID.
I'll take your old ID, uh--

25:11.176 --> 25:12.844
I know. It's scary.

25:12.928 --> 25:14.346
Our lives are changing.

25:14.429 --> 25:17.098
But… change is good.

25:17.182 --> 25:19.184
Change is [chuckles] necessary.

25:19.893 --> 25:21.186
Go to Baltimore, Kamala.

25:23.855 --> 25:24.731
[sighs]

25:24.814 --> 25:27.651
Now, how about we dig some cake
out of the trash

25:27.734 --> 25:31.821
and sing a proper "Happy Birthday"
to your grandmother?

25:33.198 --> 25:35.242
[Nirmala] I prefer
the Stevie Wonder version.

after school?

-[Fabiola] I'm down to.
-Hey, El, what are you doing here?

25:45.001 --> 25:48.004
I want you both to know that
you're more important to me than acting,

25:49.005 --> 25:51.007
and I'm absolutely in for prom.

25:51.091 --> 25:52.092
Really?

-Yes.
-[Devi chuckles] Dope.

25:58.431 --> 26:00.684
I'll be right back,
and then we can buy our tickets.

26:01.768 --> 26:04.187
-[girl] Okay, sweet. Talk to you later.

26:08.358 --> 26:13.154
Um… listen.
I am really sorry about last night.

26:13.238 --> 26:15.490
I don't know what that was with Ben,

26:15.574 --> 26:19.578
but I really, really promise
that I did not put him up to it.

26:20.328 --> 26:21.162
I know.

26:21.246 --> 26:25.041
Uh, he told me Trent got him high
and sent him over to your house.

26:25.125 --> 26:27.335
Sounds like it was a dumb prank.

26:27.419 --> 26:29.170
Oh. Okay.

26:30.213 --> 26:31.798
So then why do you still seem mad?

26:32.674 --> 26:36.469
Um, I'm… I'm not mad. I'm embarrassed.

26:37.345 --> 26:38.763
After we left your house,

26:38.847 --> 26:41.808
we took Ben to Popeyes,
where he ate like ten drumsticks.

26:41.891 --> 26:43.560
And he told me he was just texting me

26:43.643 --> 26:45.478
because he wanted
to end the year as friends.

26:46.354 --> 26:49.608
[McEnroe] Damn. Maybe that's what
he's doing with you, Devi.

26:49.691 --> 26:51.776
-I'm really sorry.
-Yeah. [sighs]

26:51.860 --> 26:55.530
I just feel a little mortified
that I showed you all our texts and stuff

26:55.614 --> 26:57.657
thinking that he might like me.

26:59.326 --> 27:01.369
Would it make you feel better to know

27:01.453 --> 27:03.955
that I kind of still have feelings
for him too?

27:04.039 --> 27:06.124
But he doesn't like me either.

27:07.292 --> 27:11.838
When you guys broke up,
I hoped that he'd ask me out, but nada.

27:12.797 --> 27:15.967
[laughs] Wait, so… we're just two rejects?

27:16.801 --> 27:18.136
Mm-hmm, yeah.

27:18.678 --> 27:20.055
[both laugh]

27:20.138 --> 27:22.599
You know, that actually
does make me feel better.

27:22.682 --> 27:23.683
Hmm.

27:23.767 --> 27:26.061
Well, we may never be besties,

27:26.144 --> 27:29.189
but I would be happy
if my dad dated your mom.

Hmm.

Well, I've always wanted
an evil stepsister, so…

-[Andres] Yeah.

27:49.209 --> 27:50.710

I'm just surprised to see you
after Birthdaygate.

27:54.005 --> 27:56.091
[chuckles] Yeah.
Well, last night made me realize

27:56.174 --> 27:59.886
that I… I can't build my life
on the… on the whims of a teenage girl.

but, uh, I do know that it's kids' stuff,
and, uh… and I'm a grown-up.

And, uh…

quite a while now.

for a while too.

28:27.372 --> 28:29.541
Why do you think
I had the cabinets replaced?

Why do you think
it took me two weeks to fix the faucet?

But she decided to remain calm.
