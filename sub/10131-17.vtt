07:09.804 --> 07:11.932
and grape jelly.

07:13.267 --> 07:14.726
Sounds good.

07:14.768 --> 07:17.854
I just hope you didn't put them

07:14.768 --> 07:17.854
all into one sandwich.

07:17.896 --> 07:19.981
[laughing]

07:22.483 --> 07:23.484
Here, look at this one.

07:23.526 --> 07:25.695
(Kimmy)

07:23.526 --> 07:25.695
'How neat.'

07:25.737 --> 07:27.447
And that one.

07:27.488 --> 07:29.532
- Hi, Stevie!

07:27.488 --> 07:29.532
- Hi, guys. We made lunch.

07:29.574 --> 07:32.869
Lunch!

07:29.574 --> 07:32.869
Food! Food! Food!

07:34.246 --> 07:36.873
[indistinct chatter]

07:36.915 --> 07:38.458
Hey, Laker-Celtics game's on.

07:38.499 --> 07:39.876
Alright!

07:38.499 --> 07:39.876
Some more b-ball!

07:39.918 --> 07:42.212
(in unison)

07:39.918 --> 07:42.212
B-ball, b-ball, b-ball.

07:43.546 --> 07:46.049
(Danny)

07:43.546 --> 07:46.049
'Girls, watch

07:43.546 --> 07:46.049
the game with us.'

07:49.552 --> 07:51.054
Animals.

07:53.223 --> 07:55.309
Glad I saved this.

07:58.937 --> 08:00.897
Come on! Go!

08:01.731 --> 08:02.774
Yes.

08:02.816 --> 08:04.151
- Yes.

08:04.192 --> 08:05.526
Yes.

08:05.568 --> 08:06.861
Yes.

08:08.363 --> 08:09.990
I really think the Lakers

08:08.363 --> 08:09.990
can repeat as world champions.

08:10.031 --> 08:11.408
If they do,

08:10.031 --> 08:11.408
they'd be the first team

08:11.450 --> 08:13.076
since Boston in '69-'70.

08:13.118 --> 08:15.078
Hey, Steve,

08:13.118 --> 08:15.078
you like my jeans?

08:15.120 --> 08:17.205
They're brand-new.

08:17.247 --> 08:18.915
Oh, yeah, great.

08:18.957 --> 08:20.667
You know, I think the Lakers

08:18.957 --> 08:20.667
have the best record

08:20.708 --> 08:22.085
since Portland back in '78.

08:22.127 --> 08:23.337
Yeah, well, they should,

08:22.127 --> 08:23.337
they got everything.

08:23.378 --> 08:24.712
They got the speed,

08:23.378 --> 08:24.712
the power, the depth

08:24.754 --> 08:28.758
and most importantly,

08:24.754 --> 08:28.758
the Laker girls.

08:28.800 --> 08:30.551
- Yes.

08:30.593 --> 08:32.304
(both)

08:30.593 --> 08:32.304
Yes.

08:32.346 --> 08:33.721
Yes!

08:36.933 --> 08:39.394
What an awesome thing..

08:39.436 --> 08:41.813
...that just happened.

08:41.855 --> 08:44.816
You don't have a clue,

08:41.855 --> 08:44.816
either, do you?

08:46.443 --> 08:48.028
Hey, does anybody else

08:46.443 --> 08:48.028
want another pickle?

08:48.069 --> 08:49.737
Oh, we're out of pickles.

08:49.779 --> 08:50.864
I'll get you some.

08:50.905 --> 08:52.491
If there are no pickles

08:50.905 --> 08:52.491
at my house

08:52.532 --> 08:54.075
I'll take a cab

08:52.532 --> 08:54.075
to the market.

08:54.117 --> 08:56.119
- Bye, Stevie.

08:54.117 --> 08:56.119
- Okay, see you later, Kammy.

08:56.161 --> 08:57.454
That's Kimmy.

08:57.496 --> 09:00.915
Hey, if it's Kammy to him,

08:57.496 --> 09:00.915
it's Kammy to me.

09:03.210 --> 09:05.295
Jesse, I'll bet two bucks

09:03.210 --> 09:05.295
Magic steals the ball.

09:05.337 --> 09:08.756
No, no. Not the way bird's

09:05.337 --> 09:08.756
been playing, buddy. You're on.

09:08.798 --> 09:10.091
Magic steals the ball.

09:10.133 --> 09:11.259
No!

09:11.301 --> 09:14.012
Yes. Two founding

09:11.301 --> 09:14.012
fathers, please.

09:14.888 --> 09:16.181
Thank you.

09:16.223 --> 09:17.557
Joey, that's incredible.

09:17.598 --> 09:20.185
I come from

09:17.598 --> 09:20.185
a long line of psychics.

09:20.227 --> 09:21.644
You mean psychos.

09:23.063 --> 09:24.814
Alright, give me a chance

09:23.063 --> 09:24.814
to win my money back here.

09:24.856 --> 09:27.025
Okay. I'm getting

09:24.856 --> 09:27.025
another vision here.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.151
I'll bet you

09:27.067 --> 09:28.151
two more bucks

09:28.193 --> 09:30.278
that Cooper steals

09:28.193 --> 09:30.278
the ball

09:30.320 --> 09:33.114
passes off to Magic, who'll lead

09:30.320 --> 09:33.114
a fast break down court

09:33.156 --> 09:35.534
end it with a

09:33.156 --> 09:35.534
slam dunk by worthy.

09:35.575 --> 09:39.037
You're out of your gourd.

09:35.575 --> 09:39.037
Alright, you're on.

09:39.079 --> 09:41.289
Look at this.

09:39.079 --> 09:41.289
Cooper steals the ball.

09:41.331 --> 09:43.542
Fast break.

09:41.331 --> 09:43.542
Magic to Scott to Magic.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.877
No, look.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.877
Pass to Worthy. Slam dunk!

09:45.919 --> 09:47.462
No way!

09:51.425 --> 09:54.052
- Unbelievable.

09:51.425 --> 09:54.052
- That's amazing.

09:54.094 --> 09:57.222
Sometimes I'm so good, I

09:54.094 --> 09:57.222
actually win money from myself.

09:57.264 --> 09:58.723
Thank you.

09:58.765 --> 10:01.184
Boy, Joey, you didn't

09:58.765 --> 10:01.184
know all this stuff

10:01.226 --> 10:03.437
when we watched

10:01.226 --> 10:03.437
this game this morning.

10:07.148 --> 10:08.275
[chuckles]

10:08.316 --> 10:09.484
[chuckles]

10:12.279 --> 10:14.948
Kids! What an imagination.

10:14.989 --> 10:18.535
One final wager.. Oh!

10:19.827 --> 10:22.372
I'll bet that if you don't give

10:19.827 --> 10:22.372
my money back

10:22.414 --> 10:24.249
you're gonna die.

10:28.628 --> 10:31.047
And I was going

10:28.628 --> 10:31.047
to give you half.

10:31.089 --> 10:32.507
[Michelle crying]

10:32.549 --> 10:34.092
Oh, baby alert. I gotta

10:32.549 --> 10:34.092
go check on Michelle.

10:34.134 --> 10:35.469
You guys stay here

10:34.134 --> 10:35.469
and watch the game.

10:35.510 --> 10:36.595
I'll take care

10:35.510 --> 10:36.595
of the kid.

10:36.636 --> 10:37.845
Oh, thanks.

10:37.887 --> 10:39.222
I'm sure you

10:37.887 --> 10:39.222
can take care of her.

10:39.264 --> 10:40.848
Considering you

10:39.264 --> 10:40.848
have no experience

10:40.890 --> 10:42.392
with an infant whatsoever.

10:42.434 --> 10:44.227
No problem.

10:45.520 --> 10:46.938
Help him.

10:50.191 --> 10:51.943
Hey, your Nephew Steve's

10:50.191 --> 10:51.943
a great kid.

10:51.985 --> 10:53.445
Thanks for being so

10:51.985 --> 10:53.445
nice to him.

10:53.487 --> 10:54.946
Ever since

10:53.487 --> 10:54.946
his dad moved out

10:54.988 --> 10:57.365
he hasn't had much

10:54.988 --> 10:57.365
of this guy stuff.

10:57.407 --> 11:01.869
Yup. Us guys gotta

10:57.407 --> 11:01.869
stick together.

11:01.911 --> 11:03.413
Bite.

11:04.581 --> 11:06.916
Hey, what's

11:04.581 --> 11:06.916
the matter, Michelle?

11:06.958 --> 11:08.751
'Um, are you hungry?'

11:08.793 --> 11:12.130
Sleepy? Grumpy?

11:08.793 --> 11:12.130
Bashful? Dopey?

11:12.172 --> 11:13.507
Sneezy? Doc?

11:14.549 --> 11:15.967
Having fun?

11:16.009 --> 11:17.594
Oh, yeah.

11:16.009 --> 11:17.594
I always have fun here.

11:17.636 --> 11:19.179
Your dad is great.

11:19.220 --> 11:20.514
I'm real glad

11:19.220 --> 11:20.514
you're back.

11:20.555 --> 11:22.223
Hey, is the little kid okay?

11:22.265 --> 11:24.392
(D.J.)

11:22.265 --> 11:24.392
'Uh, I think she needs

11:22.265 --> 11:24.392
a changing.'

11:24.434 --> 11:27.145
Uh, no, thank you.

11:24.434 --> 11:27.145
Be my guest.

11:27.187 --> 11:28.480
Oh, no.

11:27.187 --> 11:28.480
You'll be fine.

11:28.522 --> 11:30.398
I just think you need

11:28.522 --> 11:30.398
a dry run at this.

11:30.440 --> 11:32.442
Well, I think we're a little

11:30.440 --> 11:32.442
too late for that.

11:33.652 --> 11:35.612
No. I mean, practice

11:33.652 --> 11:35.612
on the monkey.

11:35.654 --> 11:37.280
Oh, right.

11:38.697 --> 11:39.991
[sighs]

11:38.697 --> 11:39.991
Alright.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.909
Okay, put the diaper on.

11:41.951 --> 11:43.828
Okay.

11:43.870 --> 11:46.581
Steve, want to go

11:43.870 --> 11:46.581
ice skating tomorrow?

11:46.623 --> 11:49.543
Oh, I can't. Your dad's

11:46.623 --> 11:49.543
taking me to a Warriors game.

11:50.168 --> 11:51.794
Okay.

11:51.836 --> 11:53.547
Well, we can go tomorrow.

11:53.588 --> 11:55.089
And since we'll be right

11:53.588 --> 11:55.089
there at the mall

11:55.131 --> 11:57.300
we can go to a movie

11:55.131 --> 11:57.300
and eat pizza

11:57.342 --> 12:00.178
and my friend Jennifer's

11:57.342 --> 12:00.178
having a boy-girl party.

12:00.220 --> 12:02.138
Well, I'm gonna be pretty busy

12:00.220 --> 12:02.138
the whole time I'm here.

12:02.180 --> 12:03.764
I gotta look

12:02.180 --> 12:03.764
at some colleges

12:03.806 --> 12:06.601
and besides, I'm a little

12:03.806 --> 12:06.601
too old for that kind of stuff.

12:07.852 --> 12:10.771
Okay, so I tape right,

12:07.852 --> 12:10.771
tape left.

12:10.813 --> 12:13.983
Alright, this monkey

12:10.813 --> 12:13.983
is ready to party.

12:14.025 --> 12:15.985
Hi, Michelle.

12:16.027 --> 12:17.529
How's everything

12:16.027 --> 12:17.529
goin', Steve?

12:17.571 --> 12:21.199
Uh, well, I think

12:17.571 --> 12:21.199
this speaks for itself.

12:21.241 --> 12:23.451
Nice work.

12:21.241 --> 12:23.451
Cheetah looks happy.

12:23.493 --> 12:25.203
- Yeah.

12:23.493 --> 12:25.203
- Come on, you're missin' it.

12:25.245 --> 12:26.371
The Bullets are

12:25.245 --> 12:26.371
playing The Pistons.

12:26.413 --> 12:28.456
Alright!

12:26.413 --> 12:28.456
I gotta see this.

12:28.498 --> 12:31.125
D.J., you don't have any plans

12:28.498 --> 12:31.125
for tomorrow afternoon, do you?

12:31.167 --> 12:32.627
Not anymore.

12:32.669 --> 12:34.879
Well, you do now because we're

12:32.669 --> 12:34.879
all goin' to the park.

12:34.921 --> 12:36.089
How does some

12:34.921 --> 12:36.089
touch football sound?

12:36.130 --> 12:37.382
Oh, great! Yeah!

12:37.424 --> 12:38.883
Then we can play

12:37.424 --> 12:38.883
some, uh, some soccer

12:38.925 --> 12:41.844
some basketball,

12:38.925 --> 12:41.844
volleyball, and tennis.

12:41.886 --> 12:43.179
And then

12:41.886 --> 12:43.179
we'll play a rousing game

12:43.221 --> 12:45.390
of let's rush Uncle Danny

12:43.221 --> 12:45.390
to the hospital.

12:45.432 --> 12:46.807
Great. Come on.

12:46.849 --> 12:48.309
See ya.

12:49.977 --> 12:52.188
And, Steve, after the game,

12:49.977 --> 12:52.188
I'm gonna take you

12:52.230 --> 12:54.107
to the locker room and

12:52.230 --> 12:54.107
introduce you to the whole team.

12:54.148 --> 12:56.150
Oh, really? I've got

12:54.148 --> 12:56.150
to meet Ralph Sampson.

12:56.192 --> 12:58.278
The man is

12:56.192 --> 12:58.278
a building.

12:58.319 --> 12:59.404
The team is a city.

12:59.446 --> 13:00.821
[chuckles]

13:01.948 --> 13:03.991
Let's have a little talk here.

13:06.785 --> 13:10.248
What do you think

13:06.785 --> 13:10.248
of your Cousin Steve?

13:10.290 --> 13:13.251
I know. He's just a big jock.

13:13.293 --> 13:15.712
You should have known him

13:13.293 --> 13:15.712
two years ago.

13:15.754 --> 13:18.298
Back when he was my friend.

13:18.339 --> 13:20.841
He doesn't care

13:18.339 --> 13:20.841
about me anymore.

13:20.883 --> 13:23.094
All he cares about

13:20.883 --> 13:23.094
is sports.

13:24.471 --> 13:26.431
Guess you're just

13:24.471 --> 13:26.431
nothing around here

13:26.473 --> 13:28.308
unless you're one

13:26.473 --> 13:28.308
of the guys.

13:28.349 --> 13:30.893
[dramatic music]

13:36.524 --> 13:37.858
I really appreciate this.

13:37.900 --> 13:39.860
Tomorrow's my first real game

13:37.900 --> 13:39.860
of touch football.

13:39.902 --> 13:41.362
And I don't want to look stupid.

13:41.404 --> 13:43.114
Stop. You look

13:41.404 --> 13:43.114
stupid already.

13:43.156 --> 13:44.407
What'd I do?

13:44.449 --> 13:46.909
D.J., you don't

13:44.449 --> 13:46.909
call it football.

13:46.951 --> 13:50.705
- You call it,<i> football!</i>

13:46.951 --> 13:50.705
-<i> Football!</i>

13:50.747 --> 13:53.458
Yes! That's it. Alright,

13:50.747 --> 13:53.458
you got lesson number one.

13:53.500 --> 13:57.504
Now, lesson number two,

13:53.500 --> 13:57.504
the ever popular psych out.

13:57.545 --> 14:00.965
No words.

13:57.545 --> 14:00.965
Just sheer intensity.

14:01.007 --> 14:02.592
Observe.

14:13.186 --> 14:16.397
[laughing]

14:16.439 --> 14:18.525
- It's something like that.

14:16.439 --> 14:18.525
- Something like that.

14:18.566 --> 14:19.900
Alright, let's show her a play,

14:18.566 --> 14:19.900
man. Let's show her a play.

14:19.942 --> 14:21.277
- Alright.

14:19.942 --> 14:21.277
- Watch this.

14:21.319 --> 14:22.821
I do a down-and-out,

14:21.319 --> 14:22.821
fake to the flag

14:22.862 --> 14:24.155
buttonhook back,

14:22.862 --> 14:24.155
and I'll hit you, okay?

14:24.197 --> 14:25.323
- Got it.

14:24.197 --> 14:25.323
- Here we go.

14:25.365 --> 14:26.366
You're gonna love this.

14:26.407 --> 14:28.660
You ready?

14:26.407 --> 14:28.660
Hut! Hut! Hut! Go!

14:28.702 --> 14:30.244
- Aah!

14:28.702 --> 14:30.244
- Alright.

14:30.286 --> 14:31.538
- Grr!

14:30.286 --> 14:31.538
- 'Go, Joey!'

14:31.579 --> 14:33.289
(Jesse)

14:31.579 --> 14:33.289
'Alright.

14:31.579 --> 14:33.289
Watch this.'

14:33.331 --> 14:34.457
I'm reading

14:33.331 --> 14:34.457
the defense, right?

14:34.499 --> 14:35.875
I'm checking

14:34.499 --> 14:35.875
the pass rush.

14:35.916 --> 14:37.794
I'm checkin', I'm checkin'

14:35.916 --> 14:37.794
my receivers.

14:37.836 --> 14:39.754
I'm-I'm-I'm still

14:37.836 --> 14:39.754
checking my receivers.

14:39.796 --> 14:42.048
I'm checking my watch.

14:42.089 --> 14:45.009
Joey! Where are you?

14:45.051 --> 14:48.596
Sorry. I just stopped off for

14:45.051 --> 14:48.596
a quick bite in the secondary.

14:48.638 --> 14:50.557
- Hit me, I'm open!

14:48.638 --> 14:50.557
- Argh!

14:50.598 --> 14:52.892
- Touchdown!

14:50.598 --> 14:52.892
- Spike it!

14:56.688 --> 14:58.523
The football!

14:58.565 --> 15:00.358
- Yeah!

14:58.565 --> 15:00.358
- Ya-hoo.

15:00.817 --> 15:03.236
Hoo.

15:03.277 --> 15:05.613
Now, this is fun.

15:05.655 --> 15:07.031
How do you guys

15:05.655 --> 15:07.031
know all this?

15:07.073 --> 15:09.701
- Well, 'cause we're guys.

15:07.073 --> 15:09.701
- Yeah.

15:09.743 --> 15:11.369
You see,

15:09.743 --> 15:11.369
it's in our blood.

15:11.411 --> 15:14.080
Guys are just born

15:11.411 --> 15:14.080
knowin' how to play..

15:14.121 --> 15:15.665
(in unison)

15:14.121 --> 15:15.665
<i>Football!</i>

15:15.707 --> 15:18.125
Alright, huh!

15:15.707 --> 15:18.125
Huh! Huh!

15:18.167 --> 15:20.169
[instrumental music]

15:34.768 --> 15:37.478
Half that money's

15:34.768 --> 15:37.478
mine, kid.

15:37.520 --> 15:39.021
Want another one

15:37.520 --> 15:39.021
of my sandwiches?

15:39.063 --> 15:41.107
Uh, no, thanks.

15:39.063 --> 15:41.107
Three's enough.

15:42.191 --> 15:44.026
Speaking of basketball.

15:44.068 --> 15:45.612
Did you know

15:44.068 --> 15:45.612
that Wilt Chamberlain

15:45.653 --> 15:48.698
scored the most points

15:45.653 --> 15:48.698
ever in an NBA game?

15:48.740 --> 15:50.366
And Moses Malone

15:48.740 --> 15:50.366
joined the league

15:50.408 --> 15:51.910
right out of high school.

15:51.951 --> 15:53.661
And if the Bulls

15:51.951 --> 15:53.661
ever built their team

15:53.703 --> 15:57.206
around Michael Jordan,

15:53.703 --> 15:57.206
they'd be unstoppable.

16:00.167 --> 16:03.671
Enough talk.

16:00.167 --> 16:03.671
Let's play<i> football!</i>

16:03.713 --> 16:05.172
Alright!

16:05.214 --> 16:07.049
Alright,

16:05.214 --> 16:07.049
we'll pick teams.

16:07.091 --> 16:09.594
I'll be a captain,

16:07.091 --> 16:09.594
because it's my football.

16:09.636 --> 16:10.887
Alright,

16:09.636 --> 16:10.887
I'll be a captain.

16:10.929 --> 16:13.306
Because your hair

16:10.929 --> 16:13.306
looks like a helmet.

16:15.266 --> 16:16.350
Way to go, football!

16:16.392 --> 16:18.269
- Yes.

16:16.392 --> 16:18.269
- Watch Michelle.

16:18.311 --> 16:19.646
There you go.

16:18.311 --> 16:19.646
Let's go. Let's pick.

16:23.942 --> 16:26.486
- Yeah, alright, Uncle Danny.

16:26.527 --> 16:29.489
Alright, let me see the first

I want you!

16:36.454 --> 16:38.205
Let me see.

16:38.247 --> 16:40.792
If I'm not

16:38.247 --> 16:40.792
on Steve's team, I'll die.

16:40.834 --> 16:42.460
Kimmy.

16:43.544 --> 16:46.756
Way to go,

16:43.544 --> 16:46.756

16:48.800 --> 16:49.884
Okay, here we go.

16:55.306 --> 16:57.517
Michelle.

16:57.558 --> 17:00.019
Come on, Michelle.

16:57.558 --> 17:00.019
High five. High five.

17:02.313 --> 17:05.608
Can you believe he

17:02.313 --> 17:05.608
picked Michelle over me?

17:06.734 --> 17:09.487
Steph, please.

17:06.734 --> 17:09.487
I have my own problems.

17:10.655 --> 17:12.782
Okay, Steph. You

17:10.655 --> 17:12.782
can be on our team.

17:12.824 --> 17:14.200
- What?

17:12.824 --> 17:14.200
- Low five.

17:14.241 --> 17:15.576
Whoo!

17:17.829 --> 17:21.081
Somebody please pick me

17:17.829 --> 17:21.081
before a stray dog shows up.

17:22.375 --> 17:24.627
Okay, we'll take Joey

17:24.669 --> 17:26.796
but you guys gotta

17:24.669 --> 17:26.796
spot us a touchdown.

17:26.838 --> 17:28.798
- It's only fair.

17:26.838 --> 17:28.798
- Enough messin' around.

17:28.840 --> 17:30.216
Let's play<i> football!</i>

17:32.719 --> 17:34.012

17:34.053 --> 17:35.638
You guys remember, the end zones

17:34.053 --> 17:35.638

17:35.680 --> 17:37.056
and this tree right here, okay?

17:37.097 --> 17:38.516
Let's go, Joey.

Alright.

17:49.652 --> 17:51.111

17:49.652 --> 17:51.111

17:51.153 --> 17:52.906
Touchdown!

Yeah! Whoo!

17:54.782 --> 17:56.492

17:54.782 --> 17:56.492
Ho.

17:56.534 --> 17:58.661
Huh! Huh! Huh!

17:58.703 --> 18:00.830
(in unison)

17:58.703 --> 18:00.830
In your face!

18:00.872 --> 18:02.456
Don't worry

18:00.872 --> 18:02.456
about it, big guy.

18:03.958 --> 18:06.794
You know,

18:03.958 --> 18:06.794
I'm worried about you.

18:06.836 --> 18:10.130
Told you you were

18:06.836 --> 18:10.130
dead meat, Gibbler.

18:10.172 --> 18:12.174
Steve, aren't we having

18:10.172 --> 18:12.174
the best time?

18:12.216 --> 18:13.384
Yeah.

18:15.428 --> 18:17.346
What are you

18:15.428 --> 18:17.346
looking at, chump!

18:17.388 --> 18:19.515
Nothin', fool!

18:21.517 --> 18:23.102
Let's get 'em,

18:21.517 --> 18:23.102
Stevie.

18:23.143 --> 18:24.729
Don't even

18:23.143 --> 18:24.729
think about it.

18:26.397 --> 18:28.524
- Okay, Steph. Here we go.

18:26.397 --> 18:28.524
- Here we go. Here we go.

18:28.566 --> 18:29.776
On three.

18:29.817 --> 18:31.778
- Hut! Hut! Hut!

18:29.817 --> 18:31.778
- Alright.

18:33.404 --> 18:35.573
Ohh! Got her!

18:35.615 --> 18:38.576
We almost fell for the old

18:35.615 --> 18:38.576
statue of Stephanie trick.

18:39.869 --> 18:41.412
Alright, alright, you girls

18:39.869 --> 18:41.412
have had your fun.

18:41.454 --> 18:43.163
Now, it's time for us guys

18:41.454 --> 18:43.163
to play some real football.

18:43.205 --> 18:44.958
- Alright!

18:44.999 --> 18:48.419
Hey! Just because we're girls

18:44.999 --> 18:48.419
doesn't mean we can't play.

18:48.461 --> 18:49.712
Let's just put

18:48.461 --> 18:49.712
the ball down

18:49.754 --> 18:51.839
and see what you

18:49.754 --> 18:51.839
guys are made of.

18:51.881 --> 18:53.925
(in unison)

18:51.881 --> 18:53.925
Ooh.

18:56.260 --> 18:57.511
Okay, Steph.

18:56.260 --> 18:57.511
Let's go.

18:57.553 --> 18:59.472
- Alright, come on.

18:57.553 --> 18:59.472
- Here we go.

18:59.513 --> 19:01.099
- Ready, sweetie?

18:59.513 --> 19:01.099
- Last play.

19:01.140 --> 19:03.101
Okay, on two. Hut! Hut!

19:03.142 --> 19:04.602
I like three better.

19:04.644 --> 19:05.645
Oh, sorry.

19:05.686 --> 19:07.271
You're right.

19:05.686 --> 19:07.271
My mistake.

19:07.313 --> 19:08.731
Okay, on three.

19:08.773 --> 19:09.899
Hut! Hut! Hut!

19:09.941 --> 19:12.110
Yes. Come on, Steph.

19:09.941 --> 19:12.110
Steve, go long.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.569
Oh, no!

19:14.278 --> 19:15.321
Yeah!

19:15.362 --> 19:17.115
D.J., what are you doing?

19:17.156 --> 19:18.866
Playing football, man.

19:18.908 --> 19:21.911
This is touch football.

19:18.908 --> 19:21.911
What's your problem?

19:21.953 --> 19:25.665
I got no problem.

19:21.953 --> 19:25.665
You got a problem?

19:25.706 --> 19:27.374
Yeah, that was

19:25.706 --> 19:27.374
a pass interference.

19:27.416 --> 19:29.002
Automatic first down.

19:29.043 --> 19:30.878
No way, you wimp!

19:32.254 --> 19:35.008
D.J., Steve's right.

19:32.254 --> 19:35.008
You were way out of line.

19:35.049 --> 19:36.550
We're not playing

19:35.049 --> 19:36.550
tackle here.

19:36.592 --> 19:38.094
Oh, sure,

19:36.592 --> 19:38.094
take Steve's side.

19:38.136 --> 19:39.804
You guys

19:38.136 --> 19:39.804
are such buddies.

19:39.846 --> 19:41.347
Why don't you

19:39.846 --> 19:41.347
just adopt him?

19:41.388 --> 19:43.933
That's what you want,

19:41.388 --> 19:43.933
isn't it?

19:45.559 --> 19:48.104
Great. Now I'm gonna start

19:45.559 --> 19:48.104
crying like a little girl.

19:48.146 --> 19:49.605
D.J.

19:51.565 --> 19:52.650
- Half time.

19:51.565 --> 19:52.650
- Yup.

19:52.692 --> 19:54.401
Half time.

19:55.611 --> 19:58.197
Shake it off,

19:55.611 --> 19:58.197
big fella.

20:02.827 --> 20:07.915
D.J., what's with the "why

20:02.827 --> 20:07.915
don't you adopt him" stuff?

20:07.957 --> 20:10.126
Oh, come on, dad.

20:07.957 --> 20:10.126
It's pretty obvious.

20:10.168 --> 20:11.752
You're taking Steve

20:10.168 --> 20:11.752
to ball games

20:11.794 --> 20:16.465
having fun, high fives

20:11.794 --> 20:16.465
all over the place.

20:16.507 --> 20:19.177
You know Steve's dad

20:16.507 --> 20:19.177
moved out last year.

20:19.218 --> 20:21.428
Steve needs me right now.

20:21.470 --> 20:22.555
It's real important

20:21.470 --> 20:22.555
for him to--

20:22.596 --> 20:26.559
I know. Hang out

20:22.596 --> 20:26.559
with the guys.

20:26.600 --> 20:27.727
What's wrong with that?

20:27.768 --> 20:30.063
Nothing, unless

20:27.768 --> 20:30.063
you're a girl.

20:30.104 --> 20:32.815
Dad, I want to spend

20:30.104 --> 20:32.815
time with him, too.

20:32.857 --> 20:35.860
We used to be

20:32.857 --> 20:35.860
such good friends.

20:35.902 --> 20:38.404
I don't know

20:35.902 --> 20:38.404
what happened.

20:40.823 --> 20:43.159
I'll tell you

20:40.823 --> 20:43.159
what's happened.

Fine, dad.

I've been here two days

21:35.086 --> 21:37.880
and this is first time

21:35.086 --> 21:37.880
I've ever been up to your room.

21:37.922 --> 21:39.882
You're a busy guy.

21:39.924 --> 21:41.926
Yeah, well, my schedule

21:39.924 --> 21:41.926
kinda opened up

21:41.968 --> 21:43.970
and I was hoping that

21:41.968 --> 21:43.970
maybe I could talk to you.

To me? You want to talk

21:44.011 --> 21:47.389
to little old me?

21:47.431 --> 21:51.018
Yeah. Look, D.J., I was-I was

21:47.431 --> 21:51.018
wondering why you clobbered me.

mad at you.

22:04.240 --> 22:05.950
I was really looking

22:04.240 --> 22:05.950
forward to you visiting

22:05.992 --> 22:08.661
and you didn't even want

22:05.992 --> 22:08.661
to go ice skating.

22:08.702 --> 22:12.165
I thought we could do stuff

22:08.702 --> 22:12.165

No, you're not.

The old Steve wouldn't have

22:22.091 --> 22:23.926
taken this long

22:23.968 --> 22:26.095
to come up to my room.

22:36.856 --> 22:39.525
and I still love you.

22:39.566 --> 22:43.570
So don't you think we can

22:39.566 --> 22:43.570
try and be friends again?

22:43.612 --> 22:46.448
You seem so much

22:43.612 --> 22:46.448
older than me now.

I'm 100 and you're 94

22:54.665 --> 22:57.668
notice the difference.

Great idea. Alright, I'll go

Oh, um...all gone.
