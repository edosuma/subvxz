RIGHT, OZ?

08:32.385 --> 08:34.931
- IT CAN DO A LOT
BUT NOT THAT.

08:35.014 --> 08:35.932
I'M SORRY, BOYS,

08:36.015 --> 08:37.808
BUT YOU'RE AT THE MERCY
OF THE MOUNTAIN NOW.

08:37.892 --> 08:39.059
- WHAT?

08:39.143 --> 08:40.477
IS THAT ALL YOU HAVE TO SAY,

08:40.561 --> 08:42.313
YOU HAM-SCENTED GEEK?

08:45.107 --> 08:46.359
- HELLO?
[rattling]

08:46.442 --> 08:47.652
HELLO!
[rattling]

08:47.735 --> 08:49.779
I'M AFRAID WE'VE LOST THEM

08:49.862 --> 08:50.738
AND THE DISPLAY CASE.

08:50.821 --> 08:56.244
[sobs]

08:56.327 --> 08:57.662
- [grunting]

08:57.745 --> 08:59.455
COLD.
KEEP GOING...

08:59.538 --> 09:01.582
IN THE COLD.

09:01.666 --> 09:03.209
[both murmuring indistinctly]

09:03.292 --> 09:04.418
[teeth chattering]

09:04.502 --> 09:08.130
WELL, I MANAGED TO FIND
SOME COLLECTIBLES.

09:08.214 --> 09:10.383
- IT'S A LITTLE BETTER ANYWAY.

09:10.466 --> 09:12.134
- [teeth chattering]
COLD, SO VERY COLD.

09:12.218 --> 09:15.554
[teeth chattering and moaning]

09:15.638 --> 09:17.223
- FANBOY,

09:17.306 --> 09:18.224
IS THIS THE END?

09:18.307 --> 09:21.727
- I'M AFRAID SO, LITTLE BUDDY.

09:21.811 --> 09:23.646
- [whimpering]

09:23.729 --> 09:24.814
- [whimpering]

09:24.897 --> 09:27.567
[both sobbing]

09:27.650 --> 09:31.946
- I WANT YOU TO KNOW
YOU'RE THE BEST FRIEND

09:32.029 --> 09:34.657
ANYBODY COULD HAVE
EVER HOPED FOR.

09:34.740 --> 09:37.159
- OH, NOT BETTER THAN YOU,
LITTLE BUDDY.

09:37.243 --> 09:40.871
I'LL NEVER FORGET YOU.

09:40.955 --> 09:44.041
- AND I'LL NEVER FORGET YOU!

09:44.125 --> 09:45.126
[both whimper]

09:46.168 --> 09:47.420
[distant cough]

09:48.379 --> 09:49.505
- OH, AND OF COURSE KYLE.

09:49.588 --> 09:52.508
[nervous laughter]
CAN'T FORGET HIM.

09:52.591 --> 09:55.261
- INDEED, YES.
GOOD SHOW ALL THE WAY ROUND.

09:55.344 --> 09:56.929
- BOY, CHUM CHUM,

09:57.013 --> 09:59.307
CAN YOU BELIEVE
AFTER ALL WE'VE BEEN THROUGH,

09:59.390 --> 10:01.058
THIS IS WHERE IT ALL ENDS?

10:01.142 --> 10:04.312
- YEAH, WE HAD SOME GOOD TIMES,
DIDN'T WE?

10:04.395 --> 10:05.646
- YOU KNOW,

10:05.730 --> 10:07.898
IT FEELS LIKE
JUST YESTERDAY WE MET.

10:10.026 --> 10:13.112
HI!

10:13.195 --> 10:14.363
- EYE!

10:14.447 --> 10:17.074
- [sniffs]
YOU WERE SO INNOCENT.

10:17.158 --> 10:18.492
- FANBOY!

10:18.576 --> 10:20.244
YOUR GLASS EYE!

10:20.328 --> 10:21.495
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

10:21.579 --> 10:22.997
I NEVER REALLY THANKED YOU
FOR THAT.

10:23.080 --> 10:24.707
- NO, YOUR EYE.

10:24.790 --> 10:25.708
[clinking]

10:25.791 --> 10:27.084
IT'S THE ANSWER.

10:27.168 --> 10:28.169
- IT IS?

10:28.252 --> 10:29.712
[gasps]
OF COURSE!

10:29.795 --> 10:30.963
IT'S SO OBVIOUS.

10:31.047 --> 10:32.548
WHY DIDN'T I
THINK OF IT SOONER?

10:32.631 --> 10:34.300
COME ON!

10:34.383 --> 10:36.469
- WAIT, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

10:36.552 --> 10:38.554
HOW IS A GLASS EYE
GOING TO SAVE US?

10:38.637 --> 10:39.555
- IF I CAN GET
JUST THE RIGHT ANGLE,

10:39.639 --> 10:41.932
THE SUN
WILL CUT THROUGH THIS SIGN,

10:42.016 --> 10:43.559
AND WE CAN USE IT TO GET DOWN.

10:43.642 --> 10:44.935
- GREAT IDEA.

10:45.019 --> 10:48.272
EXCEPT YOU NEED THE SUN
FOR THAT, YOU IDIOT.

10:48.356 --> 10:51.150
[laser zinging]

10:51.233 --> 10:52.985
OR MAYBE YOU DON'T.

10:53.069 --> 10:55.529
- TIMBER!

10:55.613 --> 10:55.863
[creaking]

10:55.946 --> 10:58.491
crash!

10:58.574 --> 10:59.492
- WHOA!

10:59.575 --> 11:00.618
- WHEE!
- [screaming]

11:03.204 --> 11:04.413
both: WE MADE IT!
WE MADE IT!

11:04.497 --> 11:06.707
WE MADE IT!
WE MADE IT!

11:06.791 --> 11:08.209
- OH, SWEET SEA LEVEL.

11:08.292 --> 11:10.419
HOW I MISSED YOU.

11:10.503 --> 11:11.504
[smooching]

11:11.587 --> 11:12.671
- WE MADE IT!
WE MADE IT!

11:12.755 --> 11:14.382
WELL, PRETTY GOOD CAMPING TRIP,
EH, CHUM?

11:14.465 --> 11:17.760
- YEAH, I REALLY LIKED THAT PART

11:17.843 --> 11:20.346
WHERE WE CELEBRATED
IN THE PARKING LOT.

11:20.429 --> 11:20.930
THE REST IS A LITTLE FOGGY,
THOUGH.

11:21.013 --> 11:23.432
- FOGGY?

11:23.516 --> 11:25.810
WE DANCED WITH DEATH!

11:25.893 --> 11:28.687
I SHALL CARRY A MENTAL PICTURE
OF THIS HORROR FOREVER.

11:31.232 --> 11:32.441
- PICTURES?
OOH!

11:32.525 --> 11:33.442
MAKE SURE YOU GET DOUBLES.

11:33.526 --> 11:35.653
- OH! OH! OH!
WAIT FOR US!

11:35.736 --> 11:36.904
- [groans]

11:36.987 --> 11:38.781
NOW STAY OFF MY ROOF!

11:38.864 --> 11:40.533
[echoing]
ROOF! ROOF! ROOF!

11:40.616 --> 11:41.951
splat!

11:42.034 --> 11:43.661
[whimpers]

11:43.744 --> 11:44.870
smash!
OW!

11:58.300 --> 12:00.302
[thunder rumbles]

12:05.599 --> 12:07.643
bang!

12:07.726 --> 12:10.146
- COCK-A-DOODLE DOO!

12:10.229 --> 12:12.565
- BOY,
IT SURE RAINED LAST NIGHT.

12:12.648 --> 12:13.315
[gasps]
OH, NO!

12:13.399 --> 12:15.484
I HOPE THE RAIN DIDN'T

12:15.568 --> 12:18.904
WASH THE MARKS
OFF MY MEASURING FLOWER.

12:18.988 --> 12:19.989
PHEW!

12:20.072 --> 12:20.865
MY LINES ARE STILL THERE.

12:20.948 --> 12:22.908
CHUM CHUM, MEASURE ME!
MEASURE ME!

12:22.992 --> 12:25.995
I WANT TO SEE IF I'VE GROWN.

12:26.078 --> 12:27.413
SO GIVE ME THE GOOD NEWS.

12:27.496 --> 12:29.039
- YOU GREW 6 INCHES...

12:29.123 --> 12:30.249
- ALL RIGHT!

12:30.332 --> 12:32.668
- SHORTER.

12:32.751 --> 12:33.627
- WAIT. WHAT?

12:33.711 --> 12:34.879
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

12:34.962 --> 12:36.839
HOW CAN THIS BE?

12:36.922 --> 12:38.090
CHUM CHUM,

12:38.174 --> 12:41.427
THERE'S ONLY ONE
RATIONAL EXPLANATION FOR THIS.

12:41.510 --> 12:45.347
I'M SHRINKING!

12:45.431 --> 12:46.474
- OR THE FLOWER GREW OVERNIGHT.

12:46.557 --> 12:48.851
- DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

12:48.934 --> 12:51.562
THIS IS A SUNFLOWER,
NOT A MOONFLOWER.

12:51.645 --> 12:54.273
IT NEEDS THE SUN TO GROW.

12:54.356 --> 12:56.525
SEE?
LOOK HOW FAST IT'S GROWING NOW.

12:56.609 --> 12:58.068
- [screams]
FANBOY!

12:58.152 --> 12:59.320
YOU JUST SHRUNK SOME MORE.

12:59.403 --> 13:00.321
- [screams]

13:00.404 --> 13:01.864
OH, MY GOSH!

13:01.947 --> 13:05.451
I'M SO SMALL, I CAN FIT
THROUGH THE CRACKS ON THE ROOF.

13:05.534 --> 13:06.869
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

13:06.952 --> 13:09.079
- DON'T WORRY, FANBOY,
WE'LL FIX YOU.

13:09.163 --> 13:11.123
WE'RE GONNA GET YOU
TO A SPECIALIST.

13:14.793 --> 13:17.338
- OOH, NOT GOOD.

13:17.421 --> 13:19.757
I SPECIFICALLY ASKED
FOR THE MEAT LOVER'S PIZZA

13:19.840 --> 13:21.300
WITH A SAUSAGE LINK CRUST,

13:21.383 --> 13:23.302
AND CLEARLY THIS IS CHEESE.

13:23.385 --> 13:26.096
I GUESS I'LL HAVE TO EAT IT...

13:26.180 --> 13:27.765
AND THEN ORDER ANOTHER ONE.

13:27.848 --> 13:29.099
[bell jingles]
- OZ!

13:29.183 --> 13:30.643
OZ?
YOU HAVE TO HELP ME.

13:30.726 --> 13:31.810
I'M SHRINKING!

13:31.894 --> 13:33.062
[yelps]

13:33.145 --> 13:34.939
[screams]

13:35.022 --> 13:35.606
OOH!

13:35.689 --> 13:37.900
[alarm rings]
[screams]

13:37.983 --> 13:39.193
I'M MICROSCOPIC.

13:39.276 --> 13:40.736
I'M SO SMALL!
[screams]

13:40.819 --> 13:41.737
CHUM CHUM, HELP!

13:41.820 --> 13:42.821
EVERYTHING WENT DARK.

13:42.905 --> 13:44.240
MY EYEBALLS ARE SHRINKING!

13:44.323 --> 13:46.075
- [grunting]
- THERE'S NO CAUSE FOR ALARM.

13:46.158 --> 13:47.743
THESE ARE MERELY PROPS
FROM THE MOVIE

13:47.826 --> 13:50.371
<i>MUTANT SCHOOL SUPPLIES</i>
<i>FROM OUTER SPACE.</i>

13:50.454 --> 13:52.039
- PHEW!
OH, WHAT A RELIEF.

13:52.122 --> 13:53.332
- WOW!

13:53.415 --> 13:56.085
THESE PROPS ARE ENORMOUS.

13:56.168 --> 13:59.588
I MEAN, LOOK AT THE SIZE
OF THIS UNDERWEAR!

13:59.672 --> 14:02.466
- THOSE ARE MINE.

14:02.550 --> 14:05.010
SO YOU FEEL
YOU MAY BE SHRINKING, HUH?

14:05.094 --> 14:06.554
I GUESS WE BETTER MEASURE YOU

14:06.637 --> 14:08.138
TO SEE
WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH HERE.

14:08.222 --> 14:10.015
WHOA.

14:10.099 --> 14:10.683
IT'S WORSE THAN I THOUGHT.

14:10.766 --> 14:13.060
YOU'RE ONLY 2 INCHES TALL.

14:13.143 --> 14:14.645
- [gasps]
2 INCHES?

14:14.728 --> 14:16.438
BUT I'M WEARING HEELS TODAY.

14:16.522 --> 14:19.066
- [whistles]

14:19.149 --> 14:22.903
- THESE STRANGE PHENOMENA
SEEM TO BE GOING AROUND.

14:22.987 --> 14:26.615
I MYSELF
HAVE A SIMILAR SIZE ANOMALY.

14:26.699 --> 14:28.701
FOR SOME YEARS NOW,
YOU MAY OR MAY NOT NOTICED,

14:28.784 --> 14:31.412
BUT I HAVE BEEN GROWING WIDER
AT AN ALARMING RATE.

14:31.495 --> 14:34.498
- WHY IS THIS HAPPENING?

14:34.582 --> 14:36.208
WHY?

14:36.292 --> 14:37.835
- I'LL TELL YOU WHY.

14:37.918 --> 14:40.754
IT ALL STARTED WHEN SCIENTISTS
REPORTED A SUPERNOVA

14:40.838 --> 14:41.463
IN THE HORSEHEAD NEBULA BELT.

14:41.547 --> 14:43.882
I REMEMBER IT WELL,

14:43.966 --> 14:48.429
BECAUSE IT WAS THE SAME DAY
THEY CAME OUT WITH...

14:48.512 --> 14:52.266
THE SUPER-DUPER PIG-OUT BAR.

14:52.349 --> 14:53.350
- WAIT A MINUTE, OZ.

14:53.434 --> 14:56.520
MAYBE IT'S NOT THE SUPERNOVA
THAT MADE YOU GROW.

14:56.604 --> 14:57.605
MAYBE IT'S THE CANDY BAR.

14:57.688 --> 15:00.316
AND MAYBE IF FANBOY ATE IT--

15:00.399 --> 15:02.067
- [chomping]

15:02.151 --> 15:04.528
SORRY.
ALL GONE.

15:04.612 --> 15:05.571
- SO THAT'S IT?

15:05.654 --> 15:08.365
ALL HOPE IS LOST.

15:08.449 --> 15:09.658
- [whimpers]

15:09.742 --> 15:11.452
THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME HOPE.

15:11.535 --> 15:13.829
OZ, WHEN'S THE NEXT SUPERNOVA?

15:13.912 --> 15:14.997
- IN...

15:15.080 --> 15:18.125
35 MILLION YEARS.

15:18.208 --> 15:19.168
slam!
- AW!

15:19.251 --> 15:20.669
THAT'S JUST TOO LONG TO WAIT.

15:20.753 --> 15:22.254
I NEED A CURE RIGHT NOW!

15:22.338 --> 15:23.672
- [slurping]

15:23.756 --> 15:25.424
- HMM?

15:25.507 --> 15:27.217
UNLESS...

15:30.095 --> 15:34.141
WE SHALL FREEZE MY BODY
FOR 35 MILLION YEARS,

15:34.224 --> 15:34.975
TILL THE TIME THAT SUPERNOVA

15:35.059 --> 15:38.145
CAN BLAST ME
BACK TO NORMAL SIZE.

15:38.228 --> 15:39.772
CRYOGENIC FLUID READY?

15:39.855 --> 15:41.065
- ROGER.
COPY THAT.

15:41.148 --> 15:42.191
[clanking and whirring]

15:42.274 --> 15:44.026
SWEET DREAMS, FUTURE BOY.

15:44.109 --> 15:46.445
[bubbling
and electricity humming]

15:46.528 --> 15:51.950
- PASSAGE OF TIME.

15:52.034 --> 15:53.369
[beeping and powering down]

15:53.452 --> 15:57.122
- EE...
CHOO.

15:57.206 --> 15:58.207
[hissing]
WOW.

15:58.290 --> 16:01.377
SO THIS IS THE FUTURE.

16:01.460 --> 16:04.088
EVERYTHING IS SO DIFFERENT.

16:04.171 --> 16:06.423
I'M TAKING A STEP...

16:06.507 --> 16:07.633
[giggles]

16:07.716 --> 16:10.052
IN THE FUTURE.

16:10.135 --> 16:12.805
I'M EATING
A CONVENIENCE STORE HOT DOG...

16:12.888 --> 16:13.889
[giggles]

16:13.972 --> 16:18.435
IN THE FUTURE.

16:18.519 --> 16:20.396
I'M GETTING SICK...

16:20.479 --> 16:22.272
[retching]

16:22.356 --> 16:23.816
[coughs and spits]

16:23.899 --> 16:25.067
[giggles]

16:25.150 --> 16:27.194
IN THE FUTURE.

16:31.782 --> 16:32.408
ding!
[yelps]

16:32.491 --> 16:33.784
CHOCOLATE! HOUSE! MOTION! CAT!

16:33.867 --> 16:35.285
OOH!

16:35.369 --> 16:35.869
[gasps]

16:35.953 --> 16:37.705
YOU MUST BE LENNY'S

16:37.788 --> 16:39.957
GREAT-GREAT-GREAT-GREAT-
GREAT-GREAT GRANDSON.

16:40.040 --> 16:43.377
YOUR ANCESTOR AND I WERE PALS
BACK IN DAYS OF OLD.

16:43.460 --> 16:46.296
I WAS KNOWN BY THE EARTH NAME
"FANBOY."

16:46.380 --> 16:47.214
beep! beep!
[gasps]

16:47.297 --> 16:48.090
YOU'VE HEARD OF ME?

16:48.173 --> 16:51.218
I SUSPECTED I'D BECOME LEGEND
ONE DAY.

16:51.301 --> 16:53.011
AND IT ONLY TOOK BEING FROZEN
FOR 35 MILLION YEARS.

16:53.095 --> 16:56.432
- ACTUALLY, YOU WERE ONLY FROZEN
FOR 45 SECONDS.

16:56.515 --> 16:57.808
- WHAT?

16:57.891 --> 16:59.143
- YOUR FRIEND GOT THIRSTY

16:59.226 --> 17:01.061
AND SUCKED YOU
OUT OF CRYOGENIC SUSPENSION.

17:01.145 --> 17:01.979
- WHAT?

17:02.062 --> 17:04.857
- OH, I'M SORRY, FANBOY.

17:04.940 --> 17:07.568
HERE, HOP ON MY HAND,
AND I'LL TAKE YOU HOME.

17:07.651 --> 17:08.444
thud!
[groans]

17:08.527 --> 17:10.738
DYING.
thud!

17:11.488 --> 17:13.741
OKAY, NOW,

17:13.824 --> 17:17.118
YOU FINISH UP YOUR BATH
WHILE I HEAT UP YOUR SUPPER.

17:17.202 --> 17:19.163
DO YOU WANT A GRAIN OF RICE
WITH YOUR PEA?

17:19.246 --> 17:20.622
