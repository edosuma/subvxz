WEBVTT

00:09.217 --> 00:10.468
Really look at me.

00:14.848 --> 00:16.474
As if I were your boyfriend.

00:20.687 --> 00:22.522
Like you want to hook up with me.

00:35.452 --> 00:37.036
Right.

00:37.871 --> 00:39.122
Yeah.

00:40.498 --> 00:42.542
Just like that.
Not like a little girl.

00:42.625 --> 00:44.210
Like a woman. Again, try it.

00:44.836 --> 00:45.879
Like that.

00:46.629 --> 00:47.964
No, stay like that.

00:56.097 --> 00:57.432
Now look down.

00:58.266 --> 00:59.559
Look down.

01:02.312 --> 01:04.105
Slowly look up.

01:04.189 --> 01:05.440
Very slow.

01:12.989 --> 01:15.116
Breathe in through your nose
and out through your mouth.

01:15.950 --> 01:17.035
Soft.

01:19.704 --> 01:20.914
Very soft.

01:24.709 --> 01:26.085
Like that.

01:27.420 --> 01:29.005
Relaxing.

01:30.048 --> 01:31.549
That's it.

01:31.633 --> 01:34.636
Through your nose
and out through your mouth.

01:34.719 --> 01:35.929
Follow me, look.

01:42.393 --> 01:43.478
That's right.

01:53.238 --> 01:54.572
Make a sound.

01:57.158 --> 01:58.409
Like the letter "A".

02:00.954 --> 02:02.413
That sounds like this.

02:06.459 --> 02:07.627
Repeat it.

02:10.964 --> 02:11.965
Again.

02:13.258 --> 02:14.259
Again.

02:15.593 --> 02:16.886
Again.

02:19.097 --> 02:20.098
Repeat it.

02:21.474 --> 02:22.475
Again.

02:23.226 --> 02:24.602
That's right. Again.

02:25.895 --> 02:27.480
Do you feel tingling?

02:31.693 --> 02:33.194
Again.

04:15.797 --> 04:17.674
THE PACK

04:34.816 --> 04:36.067
-Here is fine, Mom.
-What?

04:36.150 --> 04:37.694
Do I embarrass you?

04:37.777 --> 04:40.613
-Of course not.
-I can take you to class too.

04:40.697 --> 04:44.158
Great idea!
Come with your gun and uniform.

04:44.242 --> 04:46.286
-Shooting and making baby talk.
-Great idea!

04:46.369 --> 04:48.705
-Yes, yeah.
-See you in the afternoon.

04:54.961 --> 04:57.422
-Carla.
-<i>Boss, don't go to the station.</i>

04:57.505 --> 05:00.258
I think I found us something.

05:00.341 --> 05:02.719
-<i>Where?</i>
-Around Colina industrial park.

05:02.802 --> 05:04.345
I just sent you the location.

05:04.429 --> 05:06.222
What happened?

05:06.889 --> 05:08.224
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

05:10.810 --> 05:13.104
-Better come by.
-Copy that.

05:16.858 --> 05:18.776
No, not the backpack!

05:19.819 --> 05:23.322
-It's not funny, stop!
-Do you have to study, idiot?

05:45.053 --> 05:47.889
Thank you, I needed that.

05:50.016 --> 05:51.809
-Take this for me?
-Yeah.

05:51.893 --> 05:54.562
-So, what's up?
-A guard found the door busted.

05:54.645 --> 05:57.231
The camera shows five hooded men.

05:57.315 --> 05:58.983
An hour later,
they broke a camera.

05:59.067 --> 06:01.152
-And he didn't hear anything?
-No.

06:01.235 --> 06:04.030
He wasn't the best
security guard anyway.

06:04.113 --> 06:06.115
If they didn't steal anything,
then what's the problem?

06:07.116 --> 06:09.202
Five went in, but four came out.

06:11.621 --> 06:13.039
They entered around 2:00 a.m.

06:14.707 --> 06:17.418
-Are there any other cameras?
-No, there are no more cameras.

06:17.502 --> 06:19.670
-Just these ones?
-Yes.

06:20.296 --> 06:22.381
-Look.
-What?

06:22.465 --> 06:23.633
Look at that one.

06:24.926 --> 06:26.719
Where have I seen
those ski-masks before?

06:26.803 --> 06:28.554
Don't they look familiar?

06:28.638 --> 06:30.556
Maybe. Let me see.

06:32.892 --> 06:34.685
-Look, look.
-What?

06:35.561 --> 06:37.438
That one's being forced to walk.

06:39.357 --> 06:41.192
The shoes, the body type.

06:41.275 --> 06:43.736
The hair below the ski-mask.

06:46.072 --> 06:47.156
It's a woman.

06:49.033 --> 06:50.284
A teenager.

06:51.536 --> 06:53.204
The one who didn't leave
with them.

06:53.287 --> 06:54.997
-I want to see the crime scene.
-Yes.

07:02.588 --> 07:04.006
This way.

07:06.592 --> 07:09.428
-These are the ski-masks, right?
-Zoom in, please.

07:11.222 --> 07:13.724
Yes. Santa Ines High.

07:13.808 --> 07:15.268
-I just saw the news.
-You're right.

07:15.351 --> 07:16.602
Those are the ones.

07:16.686 --> 07:18.437
Upper-class girls.

07:18.521 --> 07:22.483
Protesting abuse
by a teacher, I think.

07:22.567 --> 07:25.027
The camera crops off around here.

07:31.659 --> 07:33.953
This is the blind spot?

07:34.036 --> 07:35.079
Yes.

08:01.772 --> 08:03.024
It's hers.

08:05.568 --> 08:09.030
Those men brought her here,
spent the night.

08:12.033 --> 08:15.244
They took their time with her
and left her here.

08:16.537 --> 08:19.165
I need a complete
forensic analysis of the scene.

08:19.248 --> 08:22.043
I want the surveillance tapes
analyzed as well.

08:22.126 --> 08:24.253
-OK.
-No, call in the car. Let's go.

08:24.337 --> 08:25.963
Where are we going?

08:26.047 --> 08:28.883
<i>Macho alert! Macho alert!</i>

08:28.966 --> 08:31.427
<i>Turn the whole country feminist!</i>

08:31.510 --> 08:34.555
<i>Macho alert! Macho alert!</i>

08:34.639 --> 08:36.057
Pardon me.

08:36.140 --> 08:39.143
These young people are minors,
you can't harass them like this.

08:39.227 --> 08:42.563
How do you respond
to the seniors' abuse allegations?

08:42.647 --> 08:43.814
They're just speculation.

08:43.898 --> 08:47.360
Did the school ignore initial
accusations against Ossandón?

08:47.443 --> 08:50.196
No concrete evidence
has been presented.

08:50.279 --> 08:52.323
When that happens, if it happens,

08:52.406 --> 08:53.991
I'll be the first to support
my students.

08:54.075 --> 08:57.453
-Get out.
-Keep your distance, please.

08:57.536 --> 09:00.289
You bastards!
Why are you defending him?

09:00.373 --> 09:01.791
Belmar is covering up!

09:01.874 --> 09:03.918
Ossandón is a sexual abuser!

09:04.001 --> 09:06.295
He's been covering for him
all these years!

09:10.633 --> 09:11.926
Leave your gun.

09:18.015 --> 09:21.394
<i>Let's see, let's see!</i>
<i>Who is in charge?</i>

09:21.477 --> 09:24.647
<i>The feminists or the chauvinists?</i>

09:35.741 --> 09:36.909
Oh, yeah.

09:36.993 --> 09:39.245
There are two girls
that are absent today.

09:39.328 --> 09:41.664
Miss Soto and Miss Ibarra.

09:41.747 --> 09:43.249
Both seniors.

09:43.958 --> 09:46.085
We'll need to contact
their families.

09:46.669 --> 09:48.379
I don't think that's necessary.

09:48.462 --> 09:50.381
I know Miss Soto is at home

09:50.464 --> 09:51.799
because she broke her foot
last week.

09:52.466 --> 09:54.885
What's the name of the other girl
who's absent today?

10:01.809 --> 10:03.060
Friendly priest, huh?

10:03.144 --> 10:04.645
Try the nuns, I would know.

10:07.690 --> 10:09.734
You can't decide who goes in
and who doesn't!

10:09.817 --> 10:13.195
Get it through your thick skull!
You're not coming in, period!

10:13.279 --> 10:15.156
You gonna stop me,
millennial bitch?

10:15.239 --> 10:16.449
You're an idiot!

10:16.532 --> 10:18.075
I'm gonna kill you!

10:20.369 --> 10:21.620
Please! Please!

10:21.704 --> 10:24.623
-You both have to calm down.
-I'm sick of having to calm down!

10:24.707 --> 10:26.500
I'm sick of these jerks
who want to resume classes

10:26.584 --> 10:28.419
-like nothing happened.
-It's their right.

10:29.337 --> 10:31.047
We don't do things like that,
Manuel.

10:31.130 --> 10:33.966
We're tired of watching
every word we say.

10:34.050 --> 10:35.176
That's it.

10:36.635 --> 10:39.430
Good afternoon. Bruno Ibarra,
academic coordinator.

10:39.513 --> 10:41.057
Blanca's father.

10:41.140 --> 10:42.641
Is something wrong
with my daughter?

10:42.725 --> 10:44.352
Do you have any idea where she is?

10:45.936 --> 10:49.023
She's not answering my calls,
but I assume she's at home.

10:50.358 --> 10:51.650
Are you sure?

11:02.995 --> 11:05.456
-My younger daughter, Celeste.
-Hi.

11:05.539 --> 11:06.749
-Hi.
-Hi.

11:08.626 --> 11:10.086
What's going on with my sister?

11:10.169 --> 11:14.298
She's not in trouble,
we just need to talk to her.

11:14.382 --> 11:16.175
You were with her last night.

11:16.258 --> 11:18.469
The officers are asking
where she went this morning.

11:21.305 --> 11:22.973
Blanca left last night
around 12:00.

11:23.057 --> 11:24.433
-What?
-Where?

11:24.517 --> 11:27.061
To meet someone, I don't know who.

11:27.144 --> 11:28.521
Did you help her?

11:29.605 --> 11:32.233
-Yes.
-Where the hell did she sleep?

11:32.316 --> 11:33.776
Please, let us talk to her.

11:33.859 --> 11:35.694
-Tell me, where?
-Hey, hey.

11:36.821 --> 11:38.197
Can we talk?

11:38.280 --> 11:39.990
-Yes.
-Thank you.

11:41.450 --> 11:42.535
Blanca.

11:44.537 --> 11:46.455
-People love her.
-Men?

11:46.539 --> 11:47.957
No, I mean that...

11:48.040 --> 11:49.750
people listen to her.

11:50.709 --> 11:51.961
People believe her.

11:52.920 --> 11:54.296
She leads the protest.

11:55.965 --> 11:57.550
And yes, men love her too.

11:57.633 --> 11:59.927
Do you know the accused teacher?

12:00.678 --> 12:02.179
Yes, but I was never his student.

12:02.888 --> 12:04.265
Also, I'm not his type.

12:05.224 --> 12:06.976
What do you mean?

12:07.059 --> 12:09.061
He loves girls in skirts.

12:09.145 --> 12:10.396
I don't wear skirts.

12:13.357 --> 12:14.608
And the school knows about it?

12:14.692 --> 12:16.318
That's why we're protesting.

12:16.402 --> 12:18.070
Because nobody believes us.

12:18.154 --> 12:19.738
Everyone defends Ossandón.

12:19.822 --> 12:21.574
Belmar, my father.

12:22.491 --> 12:24.785
How's your father's relationship
with Blanca?

12:27.621 --> 12:29.290
He shouldn't have let her go out.

12:30.875 --> 12:32.168
Why do you say that?

12:33.878 --> 12:35.171
Find her.

12:43.762 --> 12:46.474
It's the house on the left,
in front of the car.

12:46.557 --> 12:48.350
With the black gate.

12:54.440 --> 12:56.609
Bruno. What's going on?

12:56.692 --> 12:58.027
Stay calm, my love.

12:58.110 --> 12:59.862
What happened to your sister?

12:59.945 --> 13:01.405
Where is she?

13:01.489 --> 13:02.698
I don't know, Mom.

13:03.866 --> 13:05.201
I don't know.

13:12.374 --> 13:14.001
Do you like computers?

13:17.671 --> 13:19.298
Generational differences
are funny.

13:19.381 --> 13:21.133
I know nothing about computers,

13:21.217 --> 13:23.594
but my 6-year-old loves them, too.

13:26.222 --> 13:27.890
Cell phones, all that stuff.

13:27.973 --> 13:29.475
I'd like to talk
about your daughter...

13:30.392 --> 13:32.061
but I want to know
where my sister is.

13:32.144 --> 13:33.812
Was the fight between you
and your daughter

13:33.896 --> 13:35.940
also about the protest?

13:36.023 --> 13:37.566
I'm a father,
but I'm also a teacher.

13:37.650 --> 13:40.569
Sometimes school problems
mix with home problems,

13:40.653 --> 13:42.029
but that's normal, right?

13:42.112 --> 13:46.283
The school problems right now
are abuse allegations.

13:46.367 --> 13:47.660
One of your teachers, right?

13:47.743 --> 13:49.662
But we don't know
if there was abuse.

13:49.745 --> 13:52.498
There's no concrete evidence,
nothing.

13:52.581 --> 13:54.291
And what does Blanca think
about that?

13:55.918 --> 14:00.130
Blanca is very passionate,
she fiercely defends her ideas.

14:00.214 --> 14:03.884
And I think that's great,
but she's not always right.

14:03.968 --> 14:06.470
Do you believe these allegations
could be false?

14:07.930 --> 14:12.142
You can't condemn a person
without having evidence.

14:12.893 --> 14:16.272
These girls want the teacher
to be fired,

14:16.355 --> 14:20.818
and public statements to be made
against him, without any proof.

14:20.901 --> 14:21.944
Nothing.

14:22.778 --> 14:27.241
Today, social media has made
presumption of innocence a joke.

14:27.324 --> 14:31.036
So many men have been fucked over
by false accusations.

14:31.912 --> 14:33.080
If my daughter is right,

14:33.163 --> 14:35.374
I'll be the first to support her.

14:36.208 --> 14:37.960
Excuse me.

14:38.043 --> 14:40.004
Did you come here
to investigate a teacher,

14:40.087 --> 14:41.338
or to find my daughter?

14:41.422 --> 14:44.675
I called all her friends' moms,
nobody knows anything.

14:45.759 --> 14:48.304
I called her friends,
they don't know where she is.

14:48.387 --> 14:50.139
Nobody knows anything
about Blanca.

14:50.931 --> 14:54.059
She wouldn't do this,
she knows we'd worry.

14:54.143 --> 14:55.561
Something happened.

14:55.644 --> 14:57.563
Something bad happened
to my daughter.

14:57.646 --> 14:59.648
Something bad happened
to my daughter, Bruno!

14:59.732 --> 15:01.191
Alright, stay calm.

15:01.275 --> 15:02.735
Why are you looking for my sister?

15:02.818 --> 15:04.278
Or is this normal?

15:04.361 --> 15:07.072
Do you go to every school
looking for missing students?

15:07.156 --> 15:09.533
No, relax. This is just protocol.

15:10.659 --> 15:12.036
Tell me what you found.

15:13.787 --> 15:16.248
We're investigating
some surveillance tapes.

15:19.543 --> 15:21.003
What was on them?

15:23.547 --> 15:25.841
A girl interacting
with a group of people

15:25.924 --> 15:28.302
wearing the same ski-masks
from your school's protest.

15:45.235 --> 15:46.779
Well,

15:46.862 --> 15:49.114
we have here extensive
facial polytrauma.

15:50.616 --> 15:52.117
And multiple fractures.

15:53.494 --> 15:56.372
The dental records will be
a little complicated.

15:57.998 --> 15:59.708
Let alone fingerprints.

15:59.792 --> 16:01.543
We've got nothing.
Partial, at best.

16:01.627 --> 16:02.795
Commissioner.

16:15.140 --> 16:17.935
On the street,
people call me a rapist.

16:19.937 --> 16:21.271
Abuser.

16:22.564 --> 16:24.024
Do you know what that feels like?

16:25.818 --> 16:28.278
I know you're facing
two abuse allegations

16:28.362 --> 16:29.863
that have to be investigated.

16:29.947 --> 16:31.365
Go ahead.

16:33.784 --> 16:36.245
Once you find out there's
no evidence,

16:37.121 --> 16:42.000
go on the radio, TV, social media,
and tell the truth.

16:42.084 --> 16:43.919
What's the truth, Mr. Ossandón?

16:44.002 --> 16:45.921
The truth is
that I'm a drama teacher,

16:46.004 --> 16:48.132
and when you teach drama,

16:48.215 --> 16:50.718
the boundaries are very difficult
to negotiate,

16:50.801 --> 16:55.848
and affection and support
can easily turn into love,

16:55.931 --> 16:57.558
into passion, you know?

16:57.641 --> 16:59.852
Do you know what the problem is,
Mr. Ossandón?

17:00.894 --> 17:04.314
Victims of abuse,
especially if they're minors,

17:04.898 --> 17:08.610
are first broken down
psychologically.

17:09.862 --> 17:13.282
And as you say, they're teenagers.
It's easy.

17:14.825 --> 17:17.035
Then they're told
that they're liars, crazy,

17:17.119 --> 17:20.038
insistently, until they're broken.

17:20.789 --> 17:22.416
And once they're broken,

17:22.499 --> 17:25.377
those scars are used to say
they're not reliable.

17:26.795 --> 17:28.130
That works.

17:28.922 --> 17:30.466
Unfortunately, it works well.

17:30.549 --> 17:32.509
The same thing
they're doing to me?

17:35.512 --> 17:36.889
Isolating me.

17:38.724 --> 17:39.933
Breaking me.

17:42.311 --> 17:43.812
I lost everything I had.

17:45.981 --> 17:47.316
Do you know what this is?

17:48.192 --> 17:49.818
This is a witch hunt.

17:52.571 --> 17:54.239
I'm not an abuser.

17:57.201 --> 17:58.911
I'm not a pervert.

18:02.247 --> 18:03.957
I'm a good teacher.

18:18.013 --> 18:22.100
Generalized rigor mortis,
extensive loss of facial tissue.

18:22.184 --> 18:25.521
-Are there fingerprints?
-No, the tissue is very damaged.

18:27.189 --> 18:29.066
Whether she was thrown or fell,

18:29.149 --> 18:31.151
the wounds would be similar.

18:35.739 --> 18:38.575
-What's that?
-A tattoo.

18:38.659 --> 18:40.994
But it's under a week old.

18:41.078 --> 18:43.121
-Look into that, please.
-Of course.

18:46.875 --> 18:48.168
Commissioner.

18:49.962 --> 18:53.257
We got a Jane Doe that coincides
with Blanca's characteristics.

18:53.340 --> 18:55.092
-When?
-Today, around dawn.

18:56.718 --> 18:58.178
Who has the case?

18:59.012 --> 19:00.347
Elisa Murillo.

19:02.808 --> 19:04.017
OK. Thank you, Javi.

19:19.366 --> 19:20.659
Murillo.

19:21.952 --> 19:24.413
I was informed that you have
a Jane Doe in the morgue.

19:25.497 --> 19:27.082
You're very informed, huh?

19:27.791 --> 19:30.168
-Yes, very.
-I have one, indeed.

19:31.253 --> 19:34.256
I was also informed that you're
looking for a missing girl

19:34.339 --> 19:36.425
with her physical characteristics.

19:36.508 --> 19:37.759
Your point?

19:37.843 --> 19:39.803
Let's not waste time,
just give me the case.

19:42.139 --> 19:45.350
I'll make the comparisons
and keep you informed.

19:45.434 --> 19:47.352
For now the case is mine.

19:55.152 --> 19:58.113
To do what you asked,
I need your school's IP address.

20:02.242 --> 20:03.952
How long will you take?

20:04.036 --> 20:05.037
10 hours.

20:06.663 --> 20:07.664
Thanks.

20:09.291 --> 20:11.627
Again.

20:16.965 --> 20:20.594
MISSING PERSON.
PLEASE SPREAD THE WORD.

20:20.677 --> 20:22.179
Publish

20:45.243 --> 20:49.206
What's that? You got a tattoo
and didn't tell me?

20:49.289 --> 20:51.750
-No.
-Blanca, stop it!

20:51.833 --> 20:55.504
-You got a tattoo.
-No, I didn't. Show me.

21:14.481 --> 21:16.775
-Do you want me to rap?
-Do it, do it!

21:16.858 --> 21:18.151
-And I do it like this.
-Do it!

21:18.235 --> 21:19.403
OK.

21:19.486 --> 21:21.321
<i>Here I start and here I stop!</i>

21:22.364 --> 21:24.157
You thought I'd do it!

21:24.241 --> 21:25.617
Look who showed up!

21:25.701 --> 21:27.452
What are you doing here,
Fernández?

21:28.578 --> 21:30.539
I came with Diego González.

21:30.622 --> 21:32.958
Did you bring your backpack?
What's inside?

21:33.041 --> 21:34.710
Books.

21:34.793 --> 21:36.920
Hey, don't be shy. Play along!

21:37.004 --> 21:39.423
-No, no.
-Not so fast, come play.

21:39.506 --> 21:41.216
Leave him alone.

21:41.299 --> 21:43.260
Come on, dude! Let's play.
Come on, they don't bite.

21:43.343 --> 21:45.679
Sit down, get comfortable.

21:47.472 --> 21:49.683
Give it to him.

21:49.766 --> 21:51.685
Hurry up, read it.

21:51.768 --> 21:53.311
-What does it say?
-Camila.

21:54.896 --> 21:57.399
-Nice, little guy!
-Come on, dude!

21:57.482 --> 21:59.609
-He doesn't want to.
-Is that true, Gonzalo?

21:59.693 --> 22:02.029
-Cami doesn't bite, dude.
-Are you sure?

22:03.572 --> 22:05.073
Grow up, guys!

22:05.157 --> 22:07.743
-Are you gonna go?
-Are you going or not?

22:09.661 --> 22:12.039
-OK, let's go.
-Good!

22:12.122 --> 22:14.291
-Cool!
-Get in the ring!

22:14.374 --> 22:16.043
Come on, dude!

22:17.085 --> 22:20.088
-Don't be a buzzkill!
-That's it, Gonza!

22:25.761 --> 22:28.221
-Wanna listen?
-You guys are nosy!

22:28.305 --> 22:30.057
Hey, this is bullshit.

22:30.140 --> 22:32.225
If you want, we can just wait.

22:32.309 --> 22:34.061
OK.

22:34.144 --> 22:35.729
Unless you want to.

23:11.056 --> 23:12.349
What's the deal?

23:14.184 --> 23:15.769
What's wrong with you? Are you OK?

23:18.188 --> 23:21.942
Not so fast, Gonza. Enjoy it!

23:22.901 --> 23:24.694
No!

23:59.479 --> 24:00.605
Gonzalo!

24:10.657 --> 24:12.742
Gonza, are you OK?

24:14.452 --> 24:16.663
Yes, everything's fine.

24:16.746 --> 24:19.207
But you came back so early.

24:20.625 --> 24:24.254
The party was a bit boring,
and I have some things to do.

24:45.400 --> 24:48.653
-We want to get to class!
-Stop it, please. Enough!

24:48.737 --> 24:50.363
They're taking down posters!

24:50.447 --> 24:52.991
They have to be up
when the press gets here!

24:53.074 --> 24:55.994
Miss, I won't talk to you

24:56.077 --> 24:58.205
until you stop hiding
behind that mask.

24:58.288 --> 24:59.664
I'm not hiding.

24:59.748 --> 25:02.667
I'm protesting, it's different.

25:02.751 --> 25:05.629
-And why are you protesting now?
-For Blanca Ibarra.

25:11.426 --> 25:13.178
We're all worried about her.

25:13.261 --> 25:14.679
Clearly.

25:14.763 --> 25:17.974
But we don't know enough
to be protesting like this.

25:20.143 --> 25:21.645
-Have you spoken with her dad?
-No.

25:21.728 --> 25:23.188
With her family?

25:24.022 --> 25:26.107
Let's see if they agree
with this protest.

25:26.775 --> 25:30.862
Contact them
and help where it's needed.

25:32.155 --> 25:33.740
You all have to understand.

25:34.532 --> 25:38.286
This protest doesn't help
your classmate at all,

25:38.370 --> 25:39.955
quite the contrary.

25:40.538 --> 25:42.958
Maybe that's why Blanca's
not with us right now.

25:43.041 --> 25:45.335
-What are you saying?
-You can't say that!

25:45.418 --> 25:47.462
How can you say that?

25:47.545 --> 25:49.923
One thing for sure is
that we're not gonna stop!

25:50.006 --> 25:53.093
<i>We're not gonna stop!</i>

25:54.094 --> 25:55.720
<i>We're not gonna stop!</i>

25:56.888 --> 25:58.515
Enough! No violence!

25:58.598 --> 25:59.891
Augusto!

25:59.975 --> 26:01.768
Augusto, please!

26:01.851 --> 26:03.937
-Please! Please!
-They're screaming like animals!

26:04.020 --> 26:06.982
-Shut up, you fucking snob!
-Girls, girls! Not like that.

26:07.065 --> 26:08.566
That's not the way to win.

26:09.776 --> 26:12.195
I've been working with them
during this process...

26:13.446 --> 26:17.075
and it seems to me that they're...
directing it well.

26:17.158 --> 26:18.952
I don't think it's vandalism.

26:20.287 --> 26:23.081
Nobody is opposed to freedom
of expression, Manuel,

26:23.873 --> 26:27.961
but this is a school
and we must protect the classes.

26:28.044 --> 26:30.630
I know, but their leader
is missing.

26:35.719 --> 26:38.305
I think we can have
a little empathy, right?

26:40.640 --> 26:44.394
I don't think it's a whim...
or a game.

26:44.477 --> 26:45.895
For them it's serious.

26:48.606 --> 26:52.402
I don't want any more violence
at this school.

26:53.445 --> 26:56.448
Boys, wait there, please.
We'll train today, no matter what.

26:56.531 --> 26:58.074
What do you mean by violence?

26:58.158 --> 27:00.452
Girls, girls!

27:01.286 --> 27:03.121
The students clearly respect you
a great deal.

27:03.204 --> 27:06.166
I don't know if they respect me,
but I listen to them.

27:06.249 --> 27:07.667
To all of them.

27:07.751 --> 27:10.086
I'm quite used to arriving
at schools

27:10.170 --> 27:14.007
and seeing everyone stop listening
before others even speak.

27:14.090 --> 27:15.300
What do you teach?

27:15.383 --> 27:17.719
I'm not a teacher,
I'm a psychologist.

27:17.802 --> 27:20.138
I specialize in school crises.

27:20.221 --> 27:22.182
A kind of external advisor.

27:23.141 --> 27:25.477
I was brought here
to calm the storm.

27:25.560 --> 27:28.396
That's what Belmar told me,
but that's not my job.

27:28.480 --> 27:32.192
My job is to listen to victims
and help them be heard.

27:32.275 --> 27:35.111
I think the protest is a very
good way to do that.

27:35.195 --> 27:37.947
It does no good to have
the students' respect

27:38.031 --> 27:39.616
and the directors' hatred.

27:40.742 --> 27:43.453
My salary doesn't depend
on the directors' love for me.

27:43.536 --> 27:46.748
And regardless of salary,
I'll always choose what's right.

27:48.208 --> 27:51.002
Until they get tired of me,
that's where we agree:

27:51.086 --> 27:53.296
they'll fire me sooner
rather than later.

27:54.506 --> 27:57.717
This is a complicated case,
Commissioner.

27:58.593 --> 28:01.262
The school decided
to call into question...

28:02.263 --> 28:04.391
the young women's testimony.

28:04.474 --> 28:06.101
They never gave them a chance

28:06.184 --> 28:08.395
and Blanca is clearly
their leader.

28:10.313 --> 28:11.481
Over there.

28:13.775 --> 28:15.735
What's your opinion on the case?

28:18.488 --> 28:19.906
The abuse of power.

28:19.989 --> 28:21.616
The abuse of minors.

28:21.699 --> 28:23.326
Sexual abuse.

28:23.410 --> 28:25.995
They're very complicated topics.

28:26.955 --> 28:29.165
I imagine you know it very well.

28:29.249 --> 28:31.292
We're seeing forms of abuse

28:31.376 --> 28:33.378
that didn't exist a few years ago.

28:34.838 --> 28:36.673
Look, I'm a psychologist.

28:36.756 --> 28:38.842
It's not my job to seek justice.

28:39.676 --> 28:40.927
Nor do I want to.

28:41.886 --> 28:43.805
But I've worked a lot
with these girls.

28:44.848 --> 28:46.683
I know them, and I believe them.

28:49.477 --> 28:50.728
Have a seat.

28:57.485 --> 28:59.070
Do you know where Blanca could be?

28:59.612 --> 29:00.822
Or with whom?

29:01.531 --> 29:03.366
No, I don't know.

29:04.075 --> 29:05.743
We were friends but...

29:05.827 --> 29:07.287
Blanca is friends with everyone.

29:09.289 --> 29:10.498
And enemies?

29:11.124 --> 29:12.959
Did she have enemies?

29:13.042 --> 29:16.796
Yes, of course.
Belmar, for a start.

29:17.881 --> 29:19.632
They didn't get along.

29:19.716 --> 29:21.843
He hated her because
she always shut him up.

29:21.926 --> 29:24.679
But now with the protest
she has more enemies.

29:29.684 --> 29:30.810
Any names?

29:38.776 --> 29:39.944
Jose.

29:40.904 --> 29:42.405
This is confidential.

29:46.075 --> 29:47.243
It's just that...

29:48.912 --> 29:51.414
a lot of students disagree
with the protest.

29:51.498 --> 29:54.250
So, they don't like Blanca.

29:55.376 --> 29:59.005
But there are many. I mean...
it's not just Ossandón.

29:59.088 --> 30:00.381
Tell me about him.

30:01.716 --> 30:04.302
Ossandón is the typical
cool teacher

30:04.385 --> 30:05.970
that thinks he's still a kid.

30:07.180 --> 30:10.725
He always helped us pull
our grades up when we asked.

30:11.809 --> 30:13.561
But he was always flirting.

30:15.104 --> 30:16.397
Not directly.

30:16.481 --> 30:18.900
But you know when someone's
flirting with you.

30:18.983 --> 30:21.528
Could you please
be more specific, Sofia?

30:22.820 --> 30:25.698
He did some auditions
in his theater workshop.

30:28.284 --> 30:31.079
And in those auditions
he would look at you.

30:31.996 --> 30:33.373
In the eyes.

30:34.332 --> 30:36.125
And he'd give you
some instructions.

30:37.919 --> 30:39.921
He'd make you uncomfortable.

30:42.257 --> 30:43.550
That's abuse.

30:44.926 --> 30:47.011
It's an ambiguous sexual game.

30:47.095 --> 30:48.846
And he knew it.

30:48.930 --> 30:50.265
You can say it.

30:54.811 --> 30:57.480
In the last auditions he did...

31:01.734 --> 31:04.821
he made us enter one by one,
alone, behind closed doors.

31:07.156 --> 31:09.158
Does the school
have these recordings?

31:09.242 --> 31:12.370
I think he has the tapes at home,

31:12.453 --> 31:15.748
and he probably reviews them
every night with busy hands.

31:22.589 --> 31:23.756
Can I go?

31:23.840 --> 31:25.133
Yes.

31:32.515 --> 31:34.183
I have to go too.

31:34.267 --> 31:36.686
-Do you need anything else?
-No, thanks a lot.

31:59.250 --> 32:01.127
Go on.

32:03.504 --> 32:05.173
Come on, let's scrum.

32:07.175 --> 32:11.262
Good. Come on,
the front row has to go hard!

32:11.346 --> 32:13.556
-Grab on!
-Down to the scrum!

32:13.640 --> 32:15.642
Get the first shoulder in hard!

32:15.725 --> 32:17.060
Go, go!

32:17.143 --> 32:18.478
Let's win this!

32:18.561 --> 32:22.357
That's right! Very good!

32:22.440 --> 32:25.652
That's it! That's it, my lambs!

32:25.735 --> 32:27.528
Those are my lambs!

32:27.612 --> 32:29.489
Those are my lambs!

32:29.572 --> 32:31.240
Killing the lion!

32:31.324 --> 32:32.742
Come on, come on!

32:35.119 --> 32:36.371
Circle!

32:44.420 --> 32:46.255
-Go, go!
-That's it, open up.

32:47.674 --> 32:49.342
That's what I want to see.

32:49.425 --> 32:52.220
-Concentrated, strong!
-That's right, c'mon!

32:52.303 --> 32:54.055
-Ready?
-That's right!

32:54.138 --> 32:55.431
-Good.
-Let's go.

32:55.515 --> 32:57.892
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

33:00.436 --> 33:02.689
We thank you, Lord...

33:02.772 --> 33:05.274
for this helpful training.

33:05.358 --> 33:07.068
To the showers!

33:18.454 --> 33:20.415
The Wolf Game

33:21.874 --> 33:22.875
REGISTER

33:34.971 --> 33:37.223
How do I join the game?

33:38.057 --> 33:40.643
The WOLF will contact you...

33:52.613 --> 33:54.365
-Hello.
-How are you?

33:54.449 --> 33:56.367
-Everything OK?
-How are you?

33:56.451 --> 33:57.785
Fine.

33:57.869 --> 33:59.203
I'm a bit worried about Benja.

33:59.287 --> 34:02.290
Yesterday he missed the match.
You know that's not like him.

34:02.373 --> 34:04.917
He's not very well.

34:05.001 --> 34:06.335
He's been nauseous.

34:06.419 --> 34:09.422
He doesn't want to go to school
or to get up. We're worried.

34:09.505 --> 34:12.300
Well, we're all worried.
It's been very difficult.

34:12.383 --> 34:15.052
We never thought such a thing
could happen at our school.

34:15.136 --> 34:16.929
Especially to someone like Blanca.

34:17.597 --> 34:19.265
I hope it's over soon.

34:19.348 --> 34:21.309
Is Benja at home?

34:39.952 --> 34:41.245
They came to see you.

34:41.329 --> 34:42.830
Tell them to leave.

34:42.914 --> 34:44.749
-Please, dear, they're your--
-Mom.

34:45.416 --> 34:46.876
I don't want to see them.

34:49.253 --> 34:50.630
OK, I get it.

34:51.297 --> 34:52.757
I'll talk to them.

34:54.300 --> 34:55.760
Benja, look at me.

34:59.096 --> 35:01.474
You know you can tell me
anything, right?

35:03.017 --> 35:04.393
My dear?

35:23.079 --> 35:24.622
He doesn't want to see you.

35:26.123 --> 35:27.917
-Can I go up to see him?
-No, darling.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.670
He wants to be alone
and I'm going to respect that.

35:30.753 --> 35:32.046
Thanks for coming to see him.

35:32.129 --> 35:34.507
Could you have him call us?
It's urgent.

35:34.590 --> 35:37.426
We need the clothes
that he has for the team.

35:38.219 --> 35:40.555
-Do you want me to go get them?
-No, don't worry.

35:40.638 --> 35:43.349
Just tell him that.
and that we're waiting for him.

35:43.432 --> 35:44.892
OK, let's go.

35:45.726 --> 35:47.311
-Bye.
-Thank you, bye.

35:48.479 --> 35:49.814
Thank you.

36:01.492 --> 36:05.204
Blanca wasn't the only one
who used this brush.

36:05.288 --> 36:08.541
We're going to separate
the samples, so...

36:09.625 --> 36:12.211
Relax, we're used to it,
don't worry.

36:13.296 --> 36:15.298
Technology is wonderful, isn't it?

36:15.923 --> 36:17.842
Identifying bodies, for example.

36:18.634 --> 36:20.845
Why do you ask us for DNA
if there's no body?

36:21.804 --> 36:23.472
It's just a formality.

36:23.556 --> 36:26.684
Perfect, mouth wide open.
That's it.

36:27.518 --> 36:28.853
Perfect.

36:29.896 --> 36:31.772
Now put your arm here.

36:32.648 --> 36:34.275
Either one.

36:38.821 --> 36:40.323
Did you sleep?

36:41.240 --> 36:43.492
Not really, to be honest.

36:43.576 --> 36:46.871
I was up all night looking online
for any information.

36:48.497 --> 36:49.749
"Bitch."

36:51.083 --> 36:52.293
"Whore."

36:52.376 --> 36:53.878
"Feminazi."

36:53.961 --> 36:55.421
Don't do that.

36:58.299 --> 36:59.717
Don't read those things.

37:00.593 --> 37:01.844
It's useless.

37:02.803 --> 37:04.680
That won't help Blanca either.

37:06.724 --> 37:08.184
I don't understand.

37:10.019 --> 37:12.855
-All set.
-There's nothing to understand.

37:13.898 --> 37:15.900
-All set.
-It's just stupid people.

37:16.859 --> 37:18.110
That's all.

37:37.630 --> 37:38.839
Do you have it?

37:38.923 --> 37:40.341
Yes. I'll send it to you.

37:40.424 --> 37:42.134
You're not going to like it.

37:42.218 --> 37:43.761
Downloading file:

37:59.694 --> 38:02.905
<i>Like you're giving birth.</i>
<i>And start to push the baby.</i>

38:02.989 --> 38:06.534
<i>It's important that... Push!</i>

38:06.617 --> 38:09.954
<i>Pushing...with the sound,</i>
<i>with your voice.</i>

38:11.956 --> 38:13.916
<i>That's it, little by little.</i>

38:16.669 --> 38:21.257
<i>Add rhythm to your voice,</i>
<i>faster, more and more painful.</i>

38:27.805 --> 38:30.016
If they keep going to class,
it's not going to work.

38:30.099 --> 38:31.559
Don't pay attention
to those jerks.

38:31.642 --> 38:32.935
Jose, no.

38:34.437 --> 38:36.355
-I did it.
-What?

38:37.231 --> 38:38.315
What?

38:38.399 --> 38:39.525
-Ossandón?
-Yes.

38:39.608 --> 38:41.235
It took me two days,
but I hacked him.

38:43.529 --> 38:44.822
All the videos.

38:44.905 --> 38:46.490
That old man is a creep.

38:46.574 --> 38:48.367
Wait, what else did you find?

38:48.451 --> 38:51.537
A lot of porn. Amateur, S&M.

38:53.039 --> 38:54.540
We're going to destroy this creep.

38:54.623 --> 38:56.125
Yes.

38:57.918 --> 38:59.712
<i>We're going to defeat you!</i>

38:59.795 --> 39:01.964
<i>Let's take Ossandón down!</i>

39:07.053 --> 39:09.096
Don't leave this room
for any reason.

39:09.180 --> 39:10.639
Mama!

39:12.767 --> 39:15.352
<i>We're going to defeat you!</i>

39:15.436 --> 39:17.563
<i>Let's take Ossandón down!</i>

39:17.646 --> 39:20.733
<i>We're going to defeat you!</i>

39:20.816 --> 39:23.360
<i>Let's take Ossandón down!</i>

39:28.824 --> 39:30.701
Where did you get
these recordings?

39:30.785 --> 39:32.411
They were on my computer!

39:35.331 --> 39:38.042
It was an acting class
and you took it out of context

39:38.125 --> 39:40.461
and when you change the context,
the meaning changes.

39:40.544 --> 39:42.671
What did you do with Blanca,
bastard?

39:42.755 --> 39:44.423
I have nothing to do
with your friend.

39:44.507 --> 39:48.385
Get out of here!
Go home, fucking brats!

39:52.515 --> 39:54.141
Fuck! The cops!

39:54.934 --> 39:57.686
Take off your ski mask.
Take it off!

39:57.770 --> 39:59.730
Come on, get out of the car!

40:01.232 --> 40:03.651
-Go home!
-No, motherfucker!

40:10.116 --> 40:13.119
Let her go! Fucking pigs!

40:15.287 --> 40:17.206
Let her go!

40:17.289 --> 40:18.916
Calm down, young lady, please!

40:30.594 --> 40:33.681
Stand at the end of the line!
We're telling you to.

40:33.764 --> 40:36.559
Barias, what's going on?

40:36.642 --> 40:38.394
Colonel Barias, Commissioner.

40:39.353 --> 40:43.107
Colonel, I just had a long
conversation with your superior

40:43.190 --> 40:44.942
and we have agreed that...

40:45.025 --> 40:47.027
I'll take charge
of the protesters.

40:48.237 --> 40:50.489
-Please.
-Let's go, let's go.

40:51.907 --> 40:54.326
I wouldn't like to have
to call him again,

40:54.410 --> 40:57.121
so let me take control here
and I'll ignore the fact

40:57.204 --> 41:00.457
that they've been violated
and exposed.

41:00.541 --> 41:03.210
The detainees were vandalizing
a private property.

41:03.294 --> 41:06.755
The detainees are minors,
Colonel Barias.

41:07.423 --> 41:10.634
And they're also involved
in my missing persons case.

41:10.718 --> 41:13.095
So if Mr. Ossandón wants
to press charges, go ahead.

41:13.179 --> 41:15.431
For the moment,
I'm going to take them.

41:15.514 --> 41:17.224
-Please.
-Thank you.

41:17.308 --> 41:19.226
-Return their IDs.
-Of course.

41:19.310 --> 41:20.853
Celeste.

41:23.689 --> 41:25.983
-What did we agree on?
-That you'd find my sister.

41:26.066 --> 41:27.735
And that you'd let me work,

41:27.818 --> 41:30.029
and that you weren't
going to start vandalizing

41:30.112 --> 41:31.780
outside the home of a subject
under investigation.

41:31.864 --> 41:33.616
At least we're doing something.

41:36.118 --> 41:38.871
What if Ossandón has nothing to do
with your sister's disappearance?

41:41.415 --> 41:43.167
What if it's someone else?

41:45.169 --> 41:46.754
A circus.

41:47.880 --> 41:49.423
That's what you just created.

41:50.341 --> 41:53.636
A big circus, giving the public
a false suspect

41:53.719 --> 41:55.137
to keep them calm,

41:55.221 --> 41:58.057
while her real kidnapper
remains free.

42:02.061 --> 42:03.354
What did they say?

42:04.396 --> 42:06.440
Nothing, just formalities.

42:07.399 --> 42:08.901
Do they know anything else?

42:10.569 --> 42:13.822
No, when they know something,
they'll let us know.

42:24.124 --> 42:26.919
WOMEN WILL GO BACK TO THE
PLACE THEY NEVER SHOULD'VE LEFT

42:28.587 --> 42:29.880
ALEX, DO YOU WANT
TO PLAY A GAME?

42:29.964 --> 42:31.215
YES

42:36.971 --> 42:39.265
MAN'S TRUE NATURE IS VIOLENT,
TERRITORIAL, AND DOMINANT.

42:42.017 --> 42:44.228
CHOOSE YOUR PREY, ALEX.
A WOMAN YOU WANT.

42:44.311 --> 42:46.730
MARK HER AS IF SHE WERE YOURS.

42:58.576 --> 43:00.619
-Who were you talking to?
-No one.

43:00.703 --> 43:03.038
-Don't lie to me.
-No one.

43:03.122 --> 43:04.581
Who were you talking to, Celeste?

43:04.665 --> 43:05.958
-No one!
-How can I help you

43:06.041 --> 43:07.960
if you don't tell me anything?

43:09.670 --> 43:12.256
-Can I ask you a favor?
-Yes, of course.

43:13.841 --> 43:16.260
-I can't tell you anything.
-Tell me.

43:22.224 --> 43:25.394
Olivia, the case has
been politicized.

43:26.437 --> 43:29.189
Gender violence seems
like a kind of epidemic.

43:29.273 --> 43:31.608
The Ministry of Internal Affairs
is pressuring us.

43:32.526 --> 43:34.862
Gender violence has always
been an epidemic.

43:34.945 --> 43:36.989
Yes, we agree on that,
but now it has a name.

43:37.072 --> 43:39.199
-A name doesn't mean--
-OK, enough.

43:39.283 --> 43:41.493
I don't want to hear your shit.
Not today.

43:42.828 --> 43:44.496
We're all involved in this.

43:45.122 --> 43:47.875
And if we mess up,
we're all fucked.

43:47.958 --> 43:50.419
No matter our gender. OK?

43:54.173 --> 43:56.508
The DNA sample came back negative.

43:58.052 --> 43:59.470
What?

43:59.553 --> 44:01.638
Your Jane Doe has nothing to do
with the Ibarra case.

44:01.722 --> 44:04.558
Probably a suicide.
I want it investigated as such.

44:04.641 --> 44:06.268
A suicide?
And the marks on the head?

44:06.352 --> 44:09.146
No more spreading weird theories.

44:09.229 --> 44:11.315
-Especially in the press.
-They're not weird theories.

44:11.398 --> 44:12.775
It's a low-profile case.

44:12.858 --> 44:14.526
Let's keep it that way.

44:17.071 --> 44:18.906
We don't need more girls
being subjected to violence.

44:18.989 --> 44:20.866
I want Elisa on your team.

44:20.949 --> 44:22.326
Why?

44:22.409 --> 44:24.453
This case isn't a homicide.

44:24.536 --> 44:25.871
Why get the department involved?

44:25.954 --> 44:27.956
On the contrary, Blanca is alive.

44:28.040 --> 44:30.167
Elisa is the most
experienced officer

44:30.250 --> 44:31.877
in cases of gender violence.

44:31.960 --> 44:33.796
So you're gonna work together.

44:33.879 --> 44:35.255
I don't give a shit

44:35.339 --> 44:38.175
whether it's a homicide,
a kidnapping or...

44:38.258 --> 44:40.886
or maybe girls looking
for new experiences.

44:41.637 --> 44:42.679
Understood?

44:42.763 --> 44:44.515
Is that clear, Olivia?

44:44.598 --> 44:47.351
OK, get out of my office.
Let's get to work.

44:56.026 --> 44:57.945
You’re not going to tell me
what this is for?

44:58.404 --> 44:59.530
I can't.

45:03.242 --> 45:04.326
Now make a video.

45:06.286 --> 45:07.704
And who is the video for?

45:09.456 --> 45:11.041
What's this have to do
with Blanca?

45:11.125 --> 45:13.669
Sofi, I said no explanations.

45:14.420 --> 45:15.754
Please.

45:15.838 --> 45:17.381
Hey.

45:17.464 --> 45:18.674
Explain to me.

45:20.426 --> 45:22.094
My sister had this mark.

45:23.929 --> 45:26.181
Someone did it to her
without her noticing.

45:27.558 --> 45:29.017
It's part of a game.

45:30.102 --> 45:32.271
And why am I marking you
with it now?

45:33.689 --> 45:34.857
I found the game.

45:34.940 --> 45:36.775
They have you tattoo this
on a woman.

45:37.901 --> 45:39.862
-It's a test.
-You've gone crazy.

45:41.530 --> 45:44.366
-You're crazy.
-Promise you won't tell anyone.

45:44.450 --> 45:45.993
Sofia, promise me.

45:51.206 --> 45:54.960
What if...you end up like Blanca?

45:56.336 --> 45:57.963
I can't just stand by.

45:58.714 --> 46:00.716
I'm not like that
and neither are you.

46:00.799 --> 46:03.177
I know, but that's
what the police are for.

46:03.260 --> 46:04.636
No.

46:09.391 --> 46:10.726
Hey.

46:14.563 --> 46:16.815
I don't want anything bad
to happen to you.

46:17.983 --> 46:19.276
I'll be fine, OK?

46:21.320 --> 46:23.405
-Promise me.
-I promise.

46:23.489 --> 46:24.656
Promise me!

46:26.366 --> 46:27.743
I promise.

46:41.924 --> 46:43.467
Hey.

46:44.426 --> 46:46.261
I need you to film me, OK?

46:47.304 --> 46:48.889
No.

46:48.972 --> 46:50.265
Film me.

46:55.354 --> 46:56.730
There, there.

47:13.789 --> 47:15.874
In the 20 years...

47:15.958 --> 47:18.502
that I've been principal here...

47:19.461 --> 47:23.382
we've never had to go through
such a difficult situation.

47:23.465 --> 47:25.592
If anybody here knows something...

47:26.426 --> 47:31.265
even the smallest detail
about Blanca Ibarra...

47:31.348 --> 47:33.600
please, come forward...

47:33.684 --> 47:36.395
-and say it.
-Father, with all due respect.

47:36.478 --> 47:40.190
I doubt you're looking
in the right place.

47:40.274 --> 47:42.651
If someone knew something
about the girl,

47:42.734 --> 47:44.528
we already would have said it.

47:45.279 --> 47:49.825
The question I, and I think
many parents have is...

47:50.867 --> 47:52.995
when will classes resume?

47:53.078 --> 47:54.538
Yes, when?

47:54.621 --> 47:57.040
Since the protest began,

47:57.124 --> 47:58.875
our children haven't had
any classes.

47:58.959 --> 48:01.753
And that's what we expect
from this school.

48:01.837 --> 48:04.047
To educate the children, but this?

48:04.131 --> 48:05.299
I don't know.

48:05.382 --> 48:08.135
For me, frankly, this already
looks like a circus.

48:09.928 --> 48:12.264
Please, Francisca.
I understand you.

48:12.347 --> 48:15.142
But we have decided
to authorize the protest

48:15.225 --> 48:19.438
because we want to prioritize
the most important thing now:

48:19.521 --> 48:21.064
finding Blanca.

48:21.148 --> 48:25.569
Excuse me,
but your answer isn't enough.

48:25.652 --> 48:27.738
My son Augusto is part
of this school

48:27.821 --> 48:29.656
just like those girls.

48:29.740 --> 48:31.158
They can't keep wasting time.

48:31.241 --> 48:33.577
-OK, but...
-Understand me.

48:33.660 --> 48:35.996
I'm not blaming only you.

48:36.079 --> 48:39.416
There's also a group of parents
who agree with this situation.

48:39.499 --> 48:41.418
They allow their daughters
to spend the day

48:41.501 --> 48:45.130
painting banners and screaming
stupid things against a teacher

48:45.213 --> 48:48.467
against whom there's no evidence.

48:48.550 --> 48:51.011
What you need here is discipline

48:51.094 --> 48:53.555
and I don't see that anywhere.

48:53.639 --> 48:56.433
My family has had discipline
and, thanks to that,

48:56.516 --> 49:00.270
our son got into a university
in the USA.

49:00.354 --> 49:02.689
Bravo! You've done very well!

49:02.773 --> 49:06.526
Forgive me, but I'm not willing
to sacrifice anything

49:06.610 --> 49:09.154
because of parents who don't know
what to do with their daughters.

49:09.237 --> 49:10.781
And please, let's be honest.

49:10.864 --> 49:13.033
At this rate,
everyone will leave the school.

49:13.116 --> 49:15.410
Just these 20 loud girls
will be left.

49:17.788 --> 49:19.414
And this school
is unable to handle

49:19.498 --> 49:23.085
a group of 20 teenagers
who have no idea about life

49:23.168 --> 49:24.836
who fancy themselves feminists.

49:24.920 --> 49:26.421
Really.

49:27.964 --> 49:29.716
I demand here and now...

49:29.800 --> 49:32.427
that our children
go back to classes.

49:33.679 --> 49:37.057
Are you really unable to see
beyond your privilege?

49:38.642 --> 49:40.936
Do you think we're afraid?

49:41.853 --> 49:44.106
We're not afraid anymore.

49:44.189 --> 49:47.025
A friend of ours is missing.

49:47.109 --> 49:48.735
Her name is Blanca Ibarra,

49:48.819 --> 49:50.862
and it seems like
none of you care.

49:51.822 --> 49:54.658
Why do you want your children
to come back to school?

49:54.741 --> 49:57.911
You belong to the most
privileged 1% in this country.

49:57.994 --> 50:00.205
-As a rich man!
-I feel very proud.

50:00.288 --> 50:02.124
No means no!

50:02.207 --> 50:06.253
We're not going to stop
until they fire Ossandón,

50:06.336 --> 50:07.796
and until Blanca appears.

50:11.967 --> 50:14.219
Please, listen!

50:14.302 --> 50:16.388
We don't intend to leave you
out of this story.

50:16.471 --> 50:19.057
We want you to support us,
we can't force you.

50:19.141 --> 50:20.600
It's your decision.

50:20.684 --> 50:22.269
But we've already made a decision.

50:22.352 --> 50:26.189
We'll be here waiting for Blanca
to appear or be found.

50:26.273 --> 50:28.817
With our banners
and our green handkerchiefs

50:28.900 --> 50:31.611
and our ski masks!
We're not going back to normal

50:31.695 --> 50:33.530
until Blanca Ibarra appears!

51:12.402 --> 51:14.738
The day my daughter disappeared...

51:14.821 --> 51:16.656
I was angry with her.

51:16.740 --> 51:18.450
I didn't agree with the protest.

51:19.743 --> 51:21.203
But today...

51:22.245 --> 51:25.081
I think these girls' energy
is indispensable

51:25.165 --> 51:26.833
in finding my daughter.

51:26.917 --> 51:28.794
So, I ask you this favor...

51:30.378 --> 51:31.588
all of you...

51:32.214 --> 51:33.381
that...

51:33.465 --> 51:35.342
let's leave
all our differences aside...

51:35.425 --> 51:37.761
the quarrels, the...

51:40.847 --> 51:42.682
<i>No! Let me go!</i>

51:47.020 --> 51:48.563
Hey, look! Blanca!

51:53.985 --> 51:55.570
Somebody do something!

51:59.658 --> 52:01.326
No!

52:06.039 --> 52:07.290
No!

52:49.249 --> 52:50.959
ALEX, ARE YOU READY TO GO ON
TO THE NEXT LEVEL?

52:51.042 --> 52:52.335
YES - NO

52:58.049 --> 52:59.593
YES

52:59.676 --> 53:01.720
NOW YOU WON'T BE ALONE.

53:01.803 --> 53:03.513
MEET YOUR PACK.
