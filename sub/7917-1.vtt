00:24.692 --> 00:26.401
This is the Army.

00:27.986 --> 00:32.323
It's learning how to be a soldier.
And how to be much more.

00:37.287 --> 00:42.583
It's cold streams that chill your bones
and a hot meal to warm you up.

00:42.751 --> 00:45.169
It's softball and low bridges.

00:45.337 --> 00:47.547
It's a hundred ways
to prove yourself.

00:47.715 --> 00:49.006
This is the Army.

00:50.384 --> 00:53.094
If you'd like to be part of it,
call this number toll-free.

00:55.973 --> 00:59.016
That's my philosophy,
$100 shine on a $3 pair of boots.

00:59.184 --> 01:00.977
Yes, sir.

01:03.313 --> 01:06.149
I don't think I've ever
been this happy.

01:09.194 --> 01:11.529
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you.

01:19.121 --> 01:22.665
I got a nice, warm cab right here.
You sure?

01:22.833 --> 01:25.835
-Let's go. City center.
-Hey, let's go, man.

01:47.775 --> 01:50.193
Thanks for the ride, pal.

01:57.284 --> 01:58.743
Shit!

02:01.288 --> 02:03.539
God, I thought that was a dog
around your neck.

02:04.041 --> 02:06.042
If that's humor, don't bother.

02:06.210 --> 02:09.086
I want to be taken to the airport.
Be very careful with the bags.

02:09.253 --> 02:11.172
Don't scratch them.

02:12.257 --> 02:14.050
Allow me.

02:14.218 --> 02:15.760
Thank you.

02:36.281 --> 02:38.407
Would you be careful with those?

02:38.575 --> 02:41.786
Madam, perhaps you'd like
to eat your luggage.

02:42.037 --> 02:43.913
I'm in a hurry.

02:48.752 --> 02:51.587
Oh, my balls. Oh, my balls.

03:08.939 --> 03:10.439
Good morning.

03:10.607 --> 03:12.817
This is Basic English.

03:15.112 --> 03:18.030
My name is Russell Ziskey...

03:18.198 --> 03:21.075
...and I'm gonna be your instructor
for the next five weeks.

03:21.243 --> 03:24.787
I want you to call me Russell, and I'm
gonna call you by your first names...

03:24.955 --> 03:29.292
...because I would have a tough time
pronouncing some of your last names.

03:34.423 --> 03:37.800
Okay, I know you're anxious to jump
right in and start speaking English...

03:37.968 --> 03:40.970
...but there are a couple of things
I need to know first because...

03:41.138 --> 03:42.847
... I've never done this before.

03:43.015 --> 03:45.975
So how many of you would
say you speak English fairly well...

03:46.143 --> 03:48.394
...but with some difficulty?

03:50.355 --> 03:52.023
A little English?

03:54.568 --> 03:56.861
Yes, you speak some English?

03:58.322 --> 04:03.826
Son of bitch. Shit.

04:10.417 --> 04:12.501
I've never gone this way before.

04:12.669 --> 04:16.297
I'm sure there's a lot of ways
I've gone that you haven't.

04:16.464 --> 04:18.507
What is your name?

04:18.841 --> 04:22.178
John Ringer? What kind
of a name is Ringer?

04:22.346 --> 04:24.847
Winger. I'm adopted.

04:25.015 --> 04:27.683
I spent most of my life
in institutions.

04:27.851 --> 04:31.812
Doesn't surprise me. You look like
a typical lowlife character to me.

04:36.818 --> 04:41.405
Actually, I'm a photographer.
I took this job because I love people.

04:41.573 --> 04:44.700
There's nothing I enjoy more than
meeting someone like yourseIf...

04:44.868 --> 04:47.912
...and getting to know you,
then taking photos of you while I drive.

04:48.080 --> 04:52.541
Will you stop?! Turn around! Watch
the road! Stop with the pictures!

04:53.377 --> 04:55.336
Thank you so much.

04:56.922 --> 04:58.422
Aren't you going too fast?

04:58.590 --> 05:00.341
No, it's not the speed
really so much.

05:00.509 --> 05:03.219
I just wish I hadn't drunk
all that cough syrup this morning.

05:03.387 --> 05:04.679
Oh, my!

05:08.600 --> 05:10.893
-We're going to be killed!
-Oh, no.

05:11.061 --> 05:14.689
-Just keep your hands on the wheel!
-Not killed! Not killed!

05:25.075 --> 05:26.367
You....

05:26.535 --> 05:30.454
You should have your license
taken away.

05:31.498 --> 05:35.668
I am going to write
your name down...

05:35.836 --> 05:42.008
...and see that it's given to
the proper authorities, G-E-R.

05:42.175 --> 05:44.051
You're a bum!

05:44.219 --> 05:47.263
And that's all you'll ever be,
a bum!

05:49.808 --> 05:51.434
Well, that hurts, ma'am.

05:52.853 --> 05:55.688
And I don't think
I want to take your abuse.

05:55.856 --> 06:00.276
I know I don't want to take you
to the airport. How about that, huh?

06:09.494 --> 06:11.829
Hey, move that cab, buddy!

06:15.167 --> 06:18.502
Hey! You can't stop
in the middle of a bridge!

06:27.220 --> 06:29.680
Would you get back in the car?!

06:31.892 --> 06:35.061
Okay. That's really very good.
I'd like to try just one more time...

06:35.228 --> 06:37.313
...and then we'll call it a day.

06:50.660 --> 06:53.370
Okay, great, great.
All right, we'll see you next week.

06:53.538 --> 06:56.332
We'll learn some new tunes.
We'll have a great time. Bye-bye.

06:56.500 --> 06:58.626
Bye-bye.

07:17.521 --> 07:19.730
That's my car!

07:20.565 --> 07:22.733
-Hey, man!
-Instant Finance.

07:22.901 --> 07:25.236
You're late on the payments, pal.

07:54.391 --> 07:55.933
It's me.

08:01.481 --> 08:04.483
-John, is that you?
-Yeah.

08:04.651 --> 08:08.445
-Did you remember to get my dress?
-Yeah.

08:12.701 --> 08:15.536
Hi, baby. You're home
a little early, aren't you?

08:15.704 --> 08:17.705
-Yeah.
-How was your day?

08:17.873 --> 08:19.540
Fine.

08:19.875 --> 08:21.959
I got you a pizza too.

08:39.895 --> 08:41.604
I had a real bad day.

08:41.770 --> 08:44.732
Yeah. Yeah, I bet you did.

08:54.868 --> 08:56.452
I quit my job.

08:59.456 --> 09:02.041
I just can't take this anymore.

09:02.959 --> 09:05.002
I know. I gotta straighten out.

09:05.170 --> 09:07.463
-This is ridiculous.
-Right.

09:07.631 --> 09:09.089
That's what you said last week.

09:09.257 --> 09:12.468
You know, how much can you
straighten out in one week?

09:13.136 --> 09:16.138
It hasn't been a week, John.
It's been six months.

09:16.306 --> 09:17.932
Nothing's changed.

09:18.099 --> 09:21.477
You sleep in till noon, then
you watch Rocky and Bullwinkle.

09:21.645 --> 09:23.938
Then you drive your cab,
what, a couple hours?

09:24.105 --> 09:26.190
You come home,
you order out food...

09:26.358 --> 09:30.069
...and then you play those stupid Tito
Puente albums until 2 in the morning!

09:30.237 --> 09:32.404
Tito Puente is gonna be dead,
and you'll say:

09:32.572 --> 09:35.074
"I've been listening to him for years.
He's fabulous."

09:35.242 --> 09:37.618
Then you watch movies until dawn,
and then...

09:37.786 --> 09:40.329
...then you come to bed with me.

09:40.497 --> 09:44.458
You don't think that takes energy?
You're a sexual dynamo.

09:44.626 --> 09:46.168
Most guys couldn't even
handle you.

09:46.336 --> 09:49.505
I've been reading books on the outside
so I can keep up with you.

09:49.673 --> 09:51.257
It's not funny.

09:53.635 --> 09:55.552
You're going nowhere, John.

09:56.721 --> 09:58.931
It's just not that cute anymore.

10:04.688 --> 10:06.897
It's a little cute.

10:07.983 --> 10:12.194
Come on. I'm part of a lost
and restless generation.

10:12.696 --> 10:14.488
What, you want me to run
for the Senate?

10:14.656 --> 10:16.699
I don't know what I want.

10:16.866 --> 10:19.743
I just know that I don't want you.

10:22.664 --> 10:25.916
So the basic problem is
that I'm still around?

10:27.085 --> 10:30.170
Where's that sharp knife
we have? Anita!

10:34.551 --> 10:36.093
I need you.

10:36.928 --> 10:39.054
Come on, John.

10:39.222 --> 10:41.557
I knew that wasn't
gonna sound good.

10:41.891 --> 10:43.600
-Anita.
-No.

10:44.102 --> 10:47.438
John, no, it's not gonna work.
I like you, but I need something more.

10:47.605 --> 10:51.442
I need somebody who's gonna
develop with me and grow. Goodbye.

10:51.609 --> 10:53.319
-Who could grow more than me?
-Goodbye.

10:53.486 --> 10:55.988
Talk about massive potential
for growth.

10:56.156 --> 10:58.782
I am the little acorn
that becomes the oak.

10:58.950 --> 11:02.536
You can't go!
All the plants are gonna die!

11:09.836 --> 11:12.588
And then depression set in.

11:24.893 --> 11:26.268
Go away.

11:36.404 --> 11:37.821
Hi, John.

11:39.616 --> 11:41.575
What's the matter with you?

11:43.286 --> 11:44.703
Nothing.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.123
Nice shot, John.

11:53.213 --> 11:54.755
Need a little help.

11:54.923 --> 11:56.715
Hey, can I take your last beer?

11:56.883 --> 11:59.343
-No.
-We'll split it.

12:03.890 --> 12:06.183
I've had an interesting morning.

12:06.351 --> 12:08.894
In the last two hours...

12:09.062 --> 12:12.898
... I've lost my job, my apartment...

12:13.066 --> 12:15.818
...my car and my girlfriend.

12:16.194 --> 12:18.153
You still have your health.

12:24.494 --> 12:27.413
Hey. Yes, thank you.
Toss that up here.

12:30.458 --> 12:32.668
Yo. Here we are, my man.

12:32.836 --> 12:35.379
All right, come to papa.
Toss that thing. Let's go.

12:37.674 --> 12:39.091
Jeez.

12:40.385 --> 12:41.635
Thank you.

12:42.512 --> 12:44.805
The Army can make you feel
a lot of ways:

12:44.973 --> 12:49.518
-Tired, challenged, trained and proud.
-This doesn't look bad.

12:51.020 --> 12:53.021
What, the Army?

12:53.898 --> 12:55.149
You're kidding.

12:55.316 --> 12:58.360
No. I've always thought
about joining the Army.

12:58.528 --> 13:00.737
Bullshit. You're not the type.

13:03.867 --> 13:06.493
What do you mean,
I'm not the type?

13:07.162 --> 13:09.538
I've seen the kind of guys
that enlist in the Army.

13:09.706 --> 13:12.708
I saw them when I was working on
unemployment. They're like us.

13:12.876 --> 13:15.294
Except they're not as sophisticated.

13:15.462 --> 13:17.379
Yeah, they're not as old either.

13:17.547 --> 13:20.090
I bet you can't do five pushups.

13:20.258 --> 13:22.009
Five pushups?

13:23.970 --> 13:26.138
I got $3 says
I can do five pushups.

13:26.306 --> 13:28.765
Okay, let's go. Five good ones.
Come on.

13:30.310 --> 13:32.561
-Not Marine pushups.
-No, simple pushups.

13:36.733 --> 13:39.109
I've never heard bones
creak like that.

13:41.112 --> 13:42.654
That's none.

13:42.822 --> 13:45.115
-I'm praying.
-You ought to.

13:45.283 --> 13:47.701
Let's go. There's a time limit here.

13:49.412 --> 13:53.081
He's almost set.
He's eyeing that rug.

13:54.709 --> 13:57.169
And that's one.
All right. He's off.

13:57.337 --> 13:59.963
He's moving now. That's two.

14:00.131 --> 14:02.090
Not that good though.

14:06.262 --> 14:07.930
That's three.

14:08.097 --> 14:10.766
I think you're ready
for the Special Olympics.

14:11.851 --> 14:14.228
That's three.

14:14.395 --> 14:15.896
-That's four.
-Four.

14:16.064 --> 14:17.397
I was testing you.

14:17.565 --> 14:20.609
And here goes five. Will he do it?

14:21.277 --> 14:23.779
Congratulations.
You just doubled your money.

14:30.453 --> 14:32.371
I gotta get in shape.

14:33.581 --> 14:36.667
I gotta dry out,
or I'll be dead before I'm 30.

14:37.794 --> 14:39.628
The Army's my only chance.

14:40.338 --> 14:42.464
You could join a monastery.

14:43.925 --> 14:47.302
Did you ever see a monk get
wildly fucked by some teenage girls?

14:47.470 --> 14:50.639
-Never.
-So much for the monastery.

14:51.849 --> 14:53.141
Brew.

14:56.938 --> 14:59.523
-Thanks for splitting it.
-No problem.

14:59.691 --> 15:02.150
You're welcome to stay
at my place if you want.

15:02.318 --> 15:05.320
Pretty much got
that roach problem licked.

15:05.655 --> 15:07.322
I'm going Army.

15:07.490 --> 15:09.616
You've got some warped idea
about the Army.

15:09.784 --> 15:13.287
You think it's like a health club
with neat uniforms or something.

15:13.454 --> 15:16.623
I go in the Army, they turn my body
into a dangerous weapon.

15:16.791 --> 15:18.750
They make me a black belt.

15:18.918 --> 15:22.629
I'll come out a human killing machine.

15:22.797 --> 15:26.133
I think we should go
to California again and pick fruit.

15:26.301 --> 15:28.468
-They give you money.
-Who?

15:28.636 --> 15:32.514
The GI Bill.
Borrow all the money you want.

15:32.682 --> 15:34.683
Will you shut up about the Army?

15:34.851 --> 15:36.893
You borrow the money,
you buy a Winnebago.

15:37.061 --> 15:38.645
They ship it anywhere you want.

15:38.813 --> 15:41.398
You get lots of travel.
Kathmandu, guaranteed.

15:41.566 --> 15:43.400
Yeah, dysentery guaranteed.

15:43.568 --> 15:46.194
I'll be over there in Nepal
with those monkey-head chicks.

15:46.362 --> 15:48.572
They'll all be hitting on me.
"Hey, John...

15:48.740 --> 15:52.034
...thanks a lot for keeping the Chinese
off our backs. We appreciate it.

15:52.201 --> 15:54.620
Is there anything we can do for you?

15:54.787 --> 15:58.081
Oh, and by the way, handsome...

15:58.249 --> 16:00.709
...we've never been in a Winnebago."

16:01.753 --> 16:03.670
You figure it out.

16:04.047 --> 16:07.007
You ever heard stories about
the gratitude of the Nepalese people?

16:07.175 --> 16:10.052
-No.
-They'll probably teach me to levitate.

16:10.219 --> 16:12.721
A black beIt who can levitate.

16:12.889 --> 16:15.557
-With a Winnebago.
-Check, please.

16:15.725 --> 16:17.768
I can see you've got this all
figured out.

16:17.935 --> 16:20.562
You're nobody's fool
when it comes to your future, John.

16:21.856 --> 16:23.940
I'm falling apart here.

16:24.400 --> 16:29.237
All I've got are a lot of bad habits
and a lot of bad debts.

16:30.239 --> 16:34.076
I need some heavy discipline
in my Iife.

16:36.037 --> 16:39.247
You know who would be incredible
in the Army?

16:39.832 --> 16:41.083
Who?

16:41.250 --> 16:43.418
-You.
-Get out of here, I'd hate it.

16:43.586 --> 16:46.254
You would be, man.
You could go right into Intelligence.

16:46.422 --> 16:48.423
-I'm not going in.
-You could be a commander.

16:48.591 --> 16:51.593
You could probably be a general
in a year.

16:51.761 --> 16:54.930
I mean, Charles de Gaulle was
a general. You're smarter than him.

16:55.098 --> 16:57.641
That guy was like a member
of the steel-plate club.

16:57.809 --> 17:00.852
I ought to run right down there
and join up, huh?

17:01.604 --> 17:05.107
Well, I was gonna go over there.
We could use your car.

17:05.566 --> 17:08.527
-We'd have to, wouldn't we?
-Yeah.

17:21.624 --> 17:23.208
You coming in?

17:35.638 --> 17:38.432
Hey, this is a loading zone.
You can't park here.

17:38.599 --> 17:40.642
We're not parking it.
We're abandoning it.

17:40.810 --> 17:43.478
I can't believe we're doing this.

17:43.646 --> 17:46.440
Listen, if I get killed,
my blood is on your hands.

17:46.607 --> 17:50.068
Just don't get it on my shoes, okay?
Hello?

17:50.319 --> 17:53.739
I'm not saying that the Army will be
able to do for you what it did for me.

17:53.906 --> 17:57.534
All I'm saying is you get out of it
exactly what you put into it.

17:57.702 --> 18:01.163
Now, sometimes the Army's
your best shot.

18:01.330 --> 18:04.958
There's some questions I have to ask.
They're a little personal.

18:05.126 --> 18:08.295
Have you ever been convicted
of a felony or a misdemeanor?

18:08.463 --> 18:11.673
That's robbery, rape, car theft,
that sort of thing?

18:11.841 --> 18:13.550
-Convicted?
-Yeah.

18:13.718 --> 18:15.761
-No.
-Never convicted.

18:17.346 --> 18:19.181
That's good. Good.

18:19.932 --> 18:23.059
Are either of you homosexuals?

18:28.733 --> 18:30.692
You mean, like, flaming or...?

18:31.277 --> 18:34.696
Well, it's a standard question
we have to ask.

18:34.864 --> 18:37.824
No, we're not homosexual,
but we are willing to Iearn.

18:39.160 --> 18:41.578
Yeah, would they send us
someplace special?

18:43.623 --> 18:47.125
I guess that's no on both.

18:47.293 --> 18:51.338
All right, now if you'll just give
UncIe Sam your autograph here.

18:51.881 --> 18:55.967
"Sammy, get well soon."

18:56.135 --> 18:57.844
That's good. Now your name.

19:30.878 --> 19:33.129
Can I talk to you for a minute?

19:46.018 --> 19:49.062
I was wondering if you....
Are you...

19:49.230 --> 19:52.607
-...you know, holding?
-No, man, I'm not.

19:52.775 --> 19:55.777
Well, I was wondering if you could
hold something for me.

19:55.945 --> 19:58.780
What, are you smuggling furs
or something?

20:00.616 --> 20:02.450
Drugs.

20:04.579 --> 20:06.705
Excuse me. General Hansen?

20:06.873 --> 20:09.791
No, I'm not a general,
but may I help you?

20:09.959 --> 20:12.836
Yes. I want to thank you
for saving my life over in Vietnam.

20:13.004 --> 20:16.464
-I don't think that was me.
-You're right. It was Normandy Beach.

20:16.632 --> 20:19.092
I was shot up pretty bad.

20:19.260 --> 20:22.053
You grabbed me, pulled me
into a foxhole and patched me up.

20:22.221 --> 20:25.473
I don't think so and I don't care
and I don't have the time.

20:25.641 --> 20:28.059
-See this arm band? MP.
-Yes, ma'am.

20:28.227 --> 20:31.813
Stands for military police.
Are you on one of these buses?

20:31.981 --> 20:33.565
Not yet, ma'am.

20:33.733 --> 20:36.985
My job is to see that
big, strong men like you...

20:37.153 --> 20:39.446
...get on these buses
without getting lost.

20:39.614 --> 20:42.490
So why don't you just move along
and get on the bus?

20:42.658 --> 20:44.242
Did you check him off, Louise?

20:44.785 --> 20:47.871
You know, there's a strip search
before you get on the bus.

20:48.039 --> 20:50.582
-Really?
-Yeah. Be careful, man.

20:54.170 --> 20:56.838
So, what, I guess
we dig each other...

20:57.006 --> 21:00.592
...and we'll be seeing each other
around the officers' club?

21:05.723 --> 21:08.266
Watch out for this guy.
He's a troublemaker.

21:11.103 --> 21:13.438
-Do you have your papers?
-Yes. Here.

21:16.692 --> 21:18.818
What happens if I refuse
to get on the bus?

21:18.986 --> 21:21.863
You look like a sensitive,
intelligent guy.

21:22.990 --> 21:25.033
Don't make me shoot you.

21:25.201 --> 21:27.452
Climb aboard, soldier.

21:40.383 --> 21:42.884
-What do you think?
-I hope we don't go to war.

21:43.052 --> 21:46.721
Excuse me, stewardess.
Is there a movie on this flight?

21:46.889 --> 21:49.891
-Bus.
-A movie on this flight.

22:40.860 --> 22:42.861
Inside. Off the bus.

22:43.029 --> 22:45.822
Off the bus. Right on inside.

22:45.990 --> 22:48.700
Move it out, son. Move it out.

22:49.577 --> 22:51.953
Move it out!

22:52.121 --> 22:53.621
Off the bus.

22:56.333 --> 22:58.043
Right on inside.

22:58.544 --> 23:00.128
Sergeant Hulka.

23:01.756 --> 23:03.214
Yes, sir?

23:09.472 --> 23:11.139
At ease, sergeant.

23:11.640 --> 23:14.642
I'm Captain Stillman,
the new company commander.

23:15.269 --> 23:17.103
Pleased to meet you, sir.

23:17.271 --> 23:19.564
Fine-looking group of men,
wouldn't you say so?

23:20.316 --> 23:23.777
Boy, I hope this is the mess hall.

23:23.944 --> 23:25.653
How's it going, Eisenhower?

23:28.282 --> 23:31.326
Yes, sir, a fine-looking bunch
of men.

23:31.744 --> 23:35.163
Yes, well. Get them inside...

23:35.664 --> 23:37.332
...and carry on, I guess.

23:37.500 --> 23:39.793
I'll be in my office
if you need me.

23:39.960 --> 23:41.336
Yes, sir.

23:43.380 --> 23:44.839
Inside.

23:49.678 --> 23:51.638
Have that removed, corporal.

23:54.183 --> 23:55.767
Move it out!

23:59.855 --> 24:03.399
Men, welcome to
the United States Army.

24:03.567 --> 24:05.693
I'm Sergeant Hulka.

24:05.861 --> 24:08.196
I'm your drill sergeant.

24:08.364 --> 24:10.824
Before we proceed any further...

24:10.991 --> 24:12.867
...we gotta get something straight.

24:15.996 --> 24:21.084
Your mamas are not here
to take care of you now.

24:24.338 --> 24:27.465
It's just you, me and Uncle Sam.

24:28.759 --> 24:31.261
And before I leave you...

24:31.428 --> 24:35.765
...you're gonna find out that me
and Uncle Sam are one and the same.

24:35.933 --> 24:37.725
UncIe Hulka?

24:40.896 --> 24:43.398
When I tell you to move...

24:43.899 --> 24:45.817
...you'll move fast.

24:45.985 --> 24:47.902
When I tell you to jump...

24:48.070 --> 24:50.405
...you're gonna say, "How high?"

24:51.907 --> 24:54.075
And make no mistake.

24:54.243 --> 24:57.370
I don't care where you come from,
I don't care what color you are...

24:57.538 --> 25:00.039
... I don't care how smart you are
or how dumb you are...

25:00.207 --> 25:02.584
...because I'm gonna teach
every last one of you...

25:02.751 --> 25:05.044
...how to eat, sleep...

25:05.212 --> 25:09.799
...walk, talk, shoot, shit
like a United States soldier.

25:13.262 --> 25:15.680
-Understand?
-Yes, sir.

25:20.269 --> 25:21.853
I didn't hear you.

25:22.271 --> 25:23.938
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

25:24.231 --> 25:27.984
You don't say "sir" to me.
I'm a sergeant. I work for a living.

25:28.152 --> 25:30.778
-Yes, sergeant.
-I didn't hear you.

25:30.946 --> 25:34.032
-Yes, sergeant.
-Now that's what I wanna hear.

25:34.783 --> 25:37.285
You think this guy's
overdoing it a bit?

25:42.166 --> 25:43.833
You got a problem, boy?

25:44.543 --> 25:46.461
No problem, sergeant.

25:47.046 --> 25:48.630
On your feet, boy.

25:53.093 --> 25:54.802
What's your problem, boy?

25:55.221 --> 25:57.972
I was just making a joke, sergeant.

25:59.767 --> 26:02.685
Well, why don't you tell me
your joke, son?

26:02.853 --> 26:06.147
I don't think you'd think
it's funny, sir. Sergeant.

26:06.523 --> 26:08.107
How do you know?

26:08.275 --> 26:10.985
I got a hell of a sense of humor.
Ain't I, Corporal Briggs?

26:11.445 --> 26:13.071
Yes, sergeant!

26:13.822 --> 26:18.493
Corporal Briggs, we have a comedian
in our midst.

26:18.994 --> 26:21.579
Will you take
this comedian outside...

26:21.747 --> 26:24.290
...and watch him do 50 pushups?

26:24.458 --> 26:26.834
Get your goat-smelling ass
out of here!

26:28.754 --> 26:30.505
Move it!

26:30.673 --> 26:32.882
Hut, ho, hut!

26:33.467 --> 26:35.843
Anybody else want to be
a comedian in here?

26:36.262 --> 26:38.596
-No, sergeant.
-I didn't hear you!

26:38.973 --> 26:40.974
No, sergeant!

27:41.160 --> 27:43.077
You look good.

27:43.245 --> 27:46.247
Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna
Krishna, Krishna

27:46.415 --> 27:49.042
Shut up! Just shut up, will you!

27:49.209 --> 27:51.586
-I didn't mean it.
-How come yours is so long?

27:52.087 --> 27:53.963
Fifteen and a half.

27:55.549 --> 27:57.383
Thirty-three.

27:58.177 --> 27:59.886
Forty-two.

28:00.054 --> 28:01.429
-Thirty-seven.
-Thirty-seven?

28:01.597 --> 28:03.598
Step down. Grab your papers.

28:03.766 --> 28:07.226
These are 34s,
and they're loose.

28:09.021 --> 28:11.356
I gotta live with 37?

28:15.778 --> 28:17.487
Sergeant Hulka?

28:18.238 --> 28:20.281
I'm sorry about what happened
at the meeting.

28:20.449 --> 28:24.660
I certainly meant no offense by it.
It won't happen again.

28:24.828 --> 28:27.121
Keep it moving! Let's go!

28:30.584 --> 28:32.877
-Think he bought it?
-No.

28:35.672 --> 28:37.131
Boxer or jockey?

28:37.299 --> 28:40.468
You got something in a low-rise bikini?
Mesh, if possible.

28:43.305 --> 28:44.806
So where you from, Tex?

28:44.973 --> 28:48.142
Don't you ever touch me again, ever.

28:50.896 --> 28:53.022
This is pretty sweet.
Free clothing.

28:53.190 --> 28:56.609
Look at this stuff. Chicks in New York
paying top dollar for this garbage.

28:56.777 --> 28:59.153
How about that lunch?
What was that brown stuff?

29:00.989 --> 29:06.452
All right, men, fall in alongside
this roadway in a column of two.

29:06.620 --> 29:08.579
Fall in!

29:08.747 --> 29:10.873
Move it! Move it!

29:11.458 --> 29:12.875
Hi.

29:13.961 --> 29:15.420
Move it!

29:16.797 --> 29:20.925
You know something, soldier.
I've noticed you're always last.

29:21.093 --> 29:23.803
-I'm pacing myself, sergeant.
-Move it!

29:24.513 --> 29:26.139
Hold it!

29:29.184 --> 29:30.476
Sorry.

29:30.644 --> 29:32.645
Left face!

29:35.023 --> 29:37.984
Left, right, left, right.

29:38.152 --> 29:39.527
You stand in place.

29:44.032 --> 29:46.200
Forward march!

29:47.494 --> 29:49.203
Hey, we're walking.

29:49.371 --> 29:52.874
Left, right, left, right, left, right.

30:59.566 --> 31:03.277
My name's Howard J. Turkstra.
I'm from Kansas City.

31:03.820 --> 31:07.698
My hobbies are fast cars
and fast women.

31:08.951 --> 31:13.621
Because.... That's why guys in
my car club call me "The Cruiser."

31:13.789 --> 31:15.873
Should call him "The Dork."

31:16.041 --> 31:18.000
Knock it off.

31:18.168 --> 31:19.794
Go ahead.

31:20.671 --> 31:24.465
I joined the Army because my father
and my brother were in the Army.

31:26.468 --> 31:29.053
I thought I'd better join
before I got drafted.

31:34.768 --> 31:37.311
Son, there ain't no draft no more.

31:38.272 --> 31:39.730
There was one?

31:42.317 --> 31:43.901
What a jerk!

31:46.405 --> 31:47.947
Next.

31:48.865 --> 31:51.325
The name's Francis Soyer.

31:52.327 --> 31:54.412
But everybody calls me Psycho.

31:55.831 --> 32:00.585
Any of you guys call me Francis,
and I'll kill you.

32:01.336 --> 32:04.088
You just made the list, buddy.

32:04.256 --> 32:07.675
And I don't like nobody
touching my stuff!

32:08.176 --> 32:10.177
So just keep your meat hooks off.

32:10.345 --> 32:13.848
If I catch any of you guys
in my stuff, I'll kill you.

32:14.891 --> 32:18.811
Also, I don't like
nobody touching me.

32:18.979 --> 32:21.856
Now, any of you homos...

32:22.107 --> 32:25.192
...touch me, and I'll kill you.

32:28.447 --> 32:30.865
Lighten up, Francis.

32:34.745 --> 32:36.912
You're all in this together.

32:38.582 --> 32:41.876
One of these men may save your life
one of these days, understand?

32:42.044 --> 32:44.837
Then again, maybe one of us won't.

32:52.012 --> 32:53.304
-You, go ahead.
-Me?

32:53.472 --> 32:54.847
Yeah.

32:55.015 --> 32:59.060
My name's Dewey Oxberger.
My friends call me Ox.

32:59.227 --> 33:02.229
You might have noticed
I've got a slight weight problem.

33:02.648 --> 33:04.482
-No!
-Yeah, I do.

33:04.650 --> 33:07.193
Anyway, I went to this doctor.

33:07.361 --> 33:10.696
Well, he told me I swallowed
a lot of aggression...

33:10.864 --> 33:12.823
...along with a lot of pizzas.

33:12.991 --> 33:14.575
Pizzas!

33:15.035 --> 33:17.119
I'm basically a shy person.

33:17.287 --> 33:19.246
I'm a shy guy...

33:19.414 --> 33:23.000
...and he suggested taking one
of these aggression-training courses.

33:23.168 --> 33:26.796
You know, these aggressive-training
courses like EST, those type of things.

33:26.963 --> 33:30.383
Anyway, it costs 400 bucks
to join this thing.

33:30.550 --> 33:33.177
Well, I didn't have the money.

33:33.345 --> 33:38.599
And I thought to myself,
"Join the Army. It's free."

33:38.767 --> 33:42.019
So I figured while I'm here
I'll lose a few pounds.

33:42.187 --> 33:45.106
You got a six- to eight-week training
program here, a tough one.

33:45.273 --> 33:47.274
Which is perfect for me.

33:47.442 --> 33:51.612
I'm gonna walk out of here
a lean, mean, fighting machine.

33:53.281 --> 33:55.658
-Good thinking, Ox. Real good.
-It is.

33:56.368 --> 33:57.952
Ziskey.

33:58.120 --> 34:00.913
I've always been kind
of a pacifist.

34:01.540 --> 34:04.625
When I was a kid my father told me,
"Never hit anyone in anger...

34:04.793 --> 34:08.795
...unless you're absolutely sure
you can get away with it."

34:10.172 --> 34:12.299
I don't know what kind
of soldier I'll make...

34:12.467 --> 34:17.972
...but I want you guys to know that
if we ever get into real heavy combat...

34:18.139 --> 34:22.143
... I'll be right behind you guys
every step of the way.

34:25.897 --> 34:30.192
Okay, Mr. Pushups.
Let's hear your story.

34:30.652 --> 34:34.655
Chicks dig me because
I rarely wear underwear...

34:34.822 --> 34:37.992
...and when I do,
it's usually something unusual.

34:38.159 --> 34:43.496
But now I know why I have aIways
lost women to guys like you.

34:43.665 --> 34:45.875
It's not just the uniform.

34:46.042 --> 34:48.543
It's the stories that you tell.

34:48.712 --> 34:51.130
So much fun and imagination.

34:51.505 --> 34:53.591
Lee Harvey...

34:53.759 --> 34:56.802
...you are a madman.

34:58.138 --> 35:01.515
When you stole that cow...

35:01.683 --> 35:05.019
...and your friends tried
to make it with the cow.

35:05.187 --> 35:08.189
I want to party with you, cowboy.

35:08.774 --> 35:12.026
The two of us together,
forget it.

35:13.236 --> 35:15.529
I'm gonna go out on a limb here.

35:17.407 --> 35:20.785
I'm gonna volunteer my leadership
to this platoon.

35:20.952 --> 35:23.913
An Army without leaders
is like a foot...

35:24.539 --> 35:26.373
...without a big toe.

35:26.958 --> 35:29.543
And Sergeant Hulka isn't always
gonna be there...

35:29.711 --> 35:32.338
...to be that big toe for us.

35:33.089 --> 35:37.009
I think that we owe
a big round of applause...

35:37.177 --> 35:40.137
...to our newest, bestest buddy...

35:40.305 --> 35:42.348
...and big toe...

35:42.516 --> 35:44.683
...Sergeant Hulka.

35:53.735 --> 35:56.070
Well, okay, hotshot.

35:56.238 --> 35:59.448
We're gonna see what kind
of soldier you are.

35:59.616 --> 36:02.243
Reveille is 0500.

36:02.911 --> 36:04.703
We're gonna fall out
with locker boxes...

36:04.871 --> 36:07.331
...and we're gonna have
a locker-box inspection.

36:07.791 --> 36:12.086
And then we're gonna do 10 miles,
rain or shine.

36:12.921 --> 36:16.090
So you better hit them bunks,
my little babies...

36:16.258 --> 36:18.259
...or Sergeant Hulka with the big toe...

36:18.426 --> 36:21.053
...is gonna see how far he can stick it
up your ass.

36:33.024 --> 36:34.942
Out of them bunks!

36:43.952 --> 36:45.703
We got a full day ahead of us.

36:45.871 --> 36:48.664
We're gonna start out
with a five-mile run.

36:48.999 --> 36:51.584
I know I'm speaking for
the entire platoon when I say...

36:51.751 --> 36:56.463
...this run should be postponed
until this platoon is better rested.

37:00.510 --> 37:04.513
Well, I'll tell you what, soldier.
Let's make it 10 miles.

37:04.681 --> 37:06.682
Any more complaints?

37:09.227 --> 37:11.145
Thanks a lot, Winger!

37:15.567 --> 37:17.318
Nice going, asshole.

37:21.448 --> 37:23.991
You're making friends fast
around here, John.

37:26.703 --> 37:29.914
Oh, my-- Oh, my God! Mama!

37:39.007 --> 37:41.008
Captain Stillman.

37:43.136 --> 37:47.514
Major Ellis would like you to look over
these interim reports, captain, sir.

37:48.600 --> 37:52.311
Interim reports!
That's all I ever do around here.

37:52.479 --> 37:54.355
I want some action!

37:56.650 --> 37:58.525
Hold that, corporal.

38:00.987 --> 38:03.155
Oh, look at those men.

38:03.657 --> 38:04.990
Are those my men, corporal?

38:05.158 --> 38:08.202
No, sir. Those are
Captain Benton's men, sir.

38:08.703 --> 38:10.537
Well, where are my men?

38:10.705 --> 38:13.165
Let's see. Sergeant Hulka
is on the confidence course.

38:13.333 --> 38:15.250
Sergeant Crocker
is on the mortar range.

38:16.127 --> 38:18.337
Terrific. Corporal,
bring up the jeep.

38:18.713 --> 38:20.047
Yes, sir.

38:23.009 --> 38:24.426
Grenade!

38:32.769 --> 38:34.395
Go get them!

38:39.484 --> 38:42.736
Those are damn fine men.
Are they in my company?

38:42.904 --> 38:45.990
No, sir. Oh, here come
your men now, sir.

39:27.157 --> 39:40.502
Hit it!

39:44.716 --> 39:47.009
Stand up when
I'm sticking you, boy!

39:47.177 --> 39:49.094
Get down and give me 50, mother!

39:49.262 --> 39:52.931
Come on! I'll walk on your ass, boy!
I was killing--

39:53.475 --> 39:57.102
Fifteen, 16, 17....

40:22.837 --> 40:25.172
Twenty-seven, 28....

40:25.799 --> 40:26.799
Wait a minute.

40:26.966 --> 40:29.134
-You got the light one.
-Yeah, my mistake.

40:29.302 --> 40:30.636
-Yeah.
-Here, let's switch.

40:30.804 --> 40:32.930
-I kind of thought it was a mistake.
-I got it.

40:33.098 --> 40:35.015
It's real heavy.

40:35.183 --> 40:36.850
This one's light.
Stand out of the way.

40:44.651 --> 40:46.360
Fall out!

40:47.821 --> 40:50.447
-Stop! Fall in!
-Hey, sergeant, it's raining.

40:50.615 --> 40:53.200
Sergeant, I think it's a bad idea
to march today.

40:53.368 --> 40:55.619
You know, this is
the cold and flu season.

40:56.412 --> 40:59.331
Fifty-one, 52....

41:00.500 --> 41:03.210
-When's the good part, John?
-This is the good part.

41:03.378 --> 41:07.214
Get your butt down, soldier.
You'll get it shot off someday. Move it!

41:07.382 --> 41:08.715
Move it!

41:35.410 --> 41:36.869
You all right?

41:43.376 --> 41:45.752
I should've kept my head down.

41:47.964 --> 41:50.465
I learned a lot of things today, John.

41:51.801 --> 41:54.761
I've never felt more alive
in my whole life.

41:55.763 --> 41:59.016
I think this is the greatest day
I've ever spent.

41:59.684 --> 42:02.394
And I want to thank you for making me
join the Army.

42:05.982 --> 42:08.317
Get me out of here.

42:09.402 --> 42:11.445
I'll take care of you.

42:14.282 --> 42:16.950
Going south today? All right.

42:21.039 --> 42:24.124
-So, what are you taking?
-Oh, I got these from Elmo.

42:24.292 --> 42:27.252
I toId him I get sick when I fly.
I think they're Dramamine.

42:28.046 --> 42:31.465
These are Elmo’s microdots.
That's acid.

42:34.928 --> 42:36.220
John.

42:39.849 --> 42:42.517
-John, I took a lot of these.
-How many?

42:42.685 --> 42:45.854
Well, one just now
and one in the barracks.

42:46.022 --> 42:47.981
Two in the jeep.

42:48.149 --> 42:52.486
-Two when we got out of the jeep.
-Oh, no. Six hits.

42:52.654 --> 42:54.988
What a tragedy. Hey. Hey.

42:55.156 --> 42:58.408
We're not gonna let you drive now,
you sit right down here.

42:58.576 --> 43:00.702
Buckle up here, cowpoke.

43:00.870 --> 43:03.789
Stow your tray table
in the upright position, will you?

43:03.957 --> 43:07.000
You're gonna be just fine
in about 12 hours.

43:07.168 --> 43:09.878
It's gonna be kind of weird
till then, but....

43:22.225 --> 43:24.017
The plane's coming apart.

43:27.021 --> 43:28.438
Hello!

43:57.677 --> 44:00.971
I'm Captain Hollister, Special
Operations Group. Who are you?

44:01.139 --> 44:03.223
-I'm Major Dodge.
-Captain DeSoto.

44:03.558 --> 44:06.101
Pleasure to meet you, Hollister.
Heard a lot about you.

44:06.269 --> 44:09.062
Well, I never heard of you.
And you're not on my roster.

44:10.732 --> 44:13.734
That's just the way
we like to keep it, captain.

44:14.235 --> 44:16.695
It's double double top-secret.

44:17.613 --> 44:20.449
-Intelligence?
-Some.

44:20.616 --> 44:23.827
Anything I could tell you
would be a Iie, captain...

44:23.995 --> 44:26.747
...so how about we tag along
with you to your destination...

44:26.914 --> 44:29.416
...and then we'll go
our separate ways.

44:29.876 --> 44:31.752
Dismissed, captain.

44:57.195 --> 44:59.279
Okay, major, let's go!

44:59.822 --> 45:03.492
Go!

45:04.952 --> 45:06.620
Russell!

45:07.789 --> 45:10.123
They're all going backpacking, John!

45:13.628 --> 45:15.462
Go! Go! Go!

45:31.604 --> 45:34.648
The important thing is not to panic.

45:34.816 --> 45:37.484
We should, like, build a shelter,
I think.

45:37.652 --> 45:41.488
Then we make some stone tools and
we can cut some spears and arrows.

45:41.656 --> 45:44.157
Because tonight we're gonna go out
and kill a wild boar.

45:44.325 --> 45:46.451
And then we're gonna dry the meat
for traveling.

45:46.619 --> 45:49.538
And in the morning
we can chop down a big tree...

45:49.705 --> 45:51.206
...and make a dugout canoe.

45:51.374 --> 45:54.876
And we could find a river
that'll probably run down to the ocean.

45:55.044 --> 45:58.296
If we're lucky, we'll drift into
those major shipping lanes...

45:58.464 --> 46:01.800
...we'll probably get picked up in a day
or two by a Liberian freighter.

46:01.968 --> 46:03.343
What do you think?

46:03.511 --> 46:05.846
I think we should find a hotel room.

46:07.223 --> 46:08.932
That's a good idea.

46:14.355 --> 46:15.689
Hello!

46:17.316 --> 46:20.318
I think some of these plants
are edible.

46:20.486 --> 46:22.612
-Yeah.
-Not that one.

46:23.531 --> 46:26.324
I think we might have to settle
for a motel.

46:27.243 --> 46:31.329
-This looks like a main road.
-Oh, yeah, this is the interstate here.

46:31.497 --> 46:35.125
Yeah. We just find a gas station,
they'll tell us where all the nice--

46:38.880 --> 46:41.756
What a rush. The sky is brown.

47:05.031 --> 47:06.239
Hi.

47:12.288 --> 47:13.830
Thank you.

47:16.584 --> 47:17.959
Sit down.

47:38.814 --> 47:40.357
Thank you.

47:46.280 --> 47:49.282
Colombia. Love weed.

47:50.868 --> 47:52.577
Good, good, good.

47:52.745 --> 47:54.496
Pills.

47:56.165 --> 47:57.457
For you.

48:04.173 --> 48:06.007
Good, good.

48:08.886 --> 48:10.303
Oh, yeah.

48:10.471 --> 48:13.431
-Oh, it's good in stew, yeah.
-Yeah, put about 30 in there.

48:13.975 --> 48:16.309
That's good. Oh, great.

48:16.477 --> 48:18.228
Time to get out of here.

48:27.738 --> 48:29.281
What is their struggle?

48:39.083 --> 48:40.875
It's cutting time.

49:30.343 --> 49:33.511
I can't hear you!
You two should tie the knot!

50:04.168 --> 50:07.504
Hey, captain, could we get a ride
with you?

50:08.923 --> 50:10.715
Just get on the plane.

50:11.926 --> 50:13.677
You bet.

50:25.189 --> 50:26.398
Oh, God, look at that.

50:26.565 --> 50:29.609
Wash off the soap. That's right.
Wash it off.

50:29.777 --> 50:32.779
Look at that. Bend over. Drop
the soap. Oh, tits. Good.

50:32.947 --> 50:37.158
Oh, God, I wish I was a loofah.
Look at that! That's....

50:37.618 --> 50:39.953
Those muscles.

50:41.372 --> 50:44.624
Oh, I didn't know
they could do that.

50:45.334 --> 50:48.420
-Excuse me, captain.
-I don't want to be disturbed.

50:48.587 --> 50:50.422
Stillman!

50:51.882 --> 50:54.300
-Yes, sir?
-Colonel Glass to see you, sir.

50:54.468 --> 50:56.803
I can see that, corporal.
Dismissed.

50:57.179 --> 50:59.764
It's a pleasure to see you, sir.
Welcome to Fort Arnold.

50:59.932 --> 51:02.642
-Let's skip the bullshit, captain.
-Yes, sir.

51:02.810 --> 51:04.894
I've got a problem,
and I need your help.

51:05.062 --> 51:07.647
You've heard of the EM-50 project?

51:07.815 --> 51:10.233
Yes, sir. It's a tank or something.

51:10.401 --> 51:12.777
-It's an urban-assault vehicle.
-Of course.

51:12.945 --> 51:16.656
The Pentagon wants to unveil it
for the news media next month in Italy.

51:17.032 --> 51:19.325
What General Barnicke
wants from you...

51:19.493 --> 51:23.955
...is a real crack platoon of
new recruits to man the EM-50.

51:24.415 --> 51:26.040
Real go-getters.

51:26.459 --> 51:29.711
We'll have them photographed
putting the 50 through its paces.

51:29.879 --> 51:32.797
"Our newest soldiers with our
latest weapon." That kind of thing.

51:32.965 --> 51:35.842
Yes, sir. You can count on me, sir.

51:36.010 --> 51:37.677
You screw this up, Stillman...

51:37.845 --> 51:41.181
...and I'll have you assigned to a
weather station above the Arctic Circle.

51:41.348 --> 51:43.767
-You got that?
-Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

51:43.934 --> 51:45.351
Good.

51:48.355 --> 51:49.731
Attention!

51:56.280 --> 51:57.906
-I'm gonna fold.
-Okay.

51:58.073 --> 52:00.700
Well, I'm still in.
Cruise, how about you?

52:01.410 --> 52:02.702
Maybe I should fold.

52:02.870 --> 52:04.954
Well, let me see.
Let me see first.

52:05.122 --> 52:07.832
No, not with a hand like that.
Come on.

52:08.000 --> 52:10.543
Dare me. Go on, bluff me.
Come on.

52:10.711 --> 52:12.545
How much should I bet?

52:12.713 --> 52:14.881
If it were me, I'd bet everything.

52:15.049 --> 52:18.092
But that's me. I'm
an aggressive gambler. Mr. Vegas.

52:20.471 --> 52:24.224
Come on. Go for it. Go for it.

52:24.391 --> 52:26.726
Yes, yes, there we go. I'm in.

52:26.894 --> 52:28.937
-What do you got?
-Well, I got a full house.

52:29.104 --> 52:32.357
Three threes and two sixes, that's
a full house. What have you got?

52:32.525 --> 52:35.443
-Two fours, I got an ace.
-You got an ace, an eight and a seven.

52:35.611 --> 52:39.948
Well, you lose. If you would've had
four fours, you would've won.

52:40.115 --> 52:42.534
-You're getting good.
-Starting to get the hang of it.

52:42.701 --> 52:46.162
Isn't this fun? You're pretty good
for a first time, really.

52:46.330 --> 52:47.747
Attention!

52:48.791 --> 52:51.459
Fall in for muster. Move it! Move it!

52:53.254 --> 52:54.671
Ten-hut!

52:57.758 --> 53:00.260
It's come to my attention...

53:00.427 --> 53:03.972
...that several members of
the 3rd Platoon Bravo Company...

53:04.139 --> 53:06.891
...left this military post
without permission.

53:10.104 --> 53:12.146
I wanna know who it was.

53:14.817 --> 53:16.943
You can tell me now...

53:19.655 --> 53:22.866
...or I got ways
of finding out myself.

53:34.295 --> 53:36.337
Okay, mister...

53:36.505 --> 53:41.301
...you just got yourself 24 hours
of scrubbing garbage cans.

53:41.719 --> 53:43.303
Step back!

53:47.141 --> 53:50.977
Now, since nobody else
has got the guts...

53:52.605 --> 53:54.647
...to admit it...

53:55.608 --> 53:57.901
...the rest of this platoon...

53:58.068 --> 54:01.487
...will do the next two weekends
on KP.

54:04.325 --> 54:06.659
How's that sound to you, mister?

54:06.827 --> 54:08.745
I think it sucks.

54:11.081 --> 54:14.751
It's time you and me
had a private talk, Winger.

54:14.919 --> 54:16.836
Step into my office.

54:29.808 --> 54:32.727
I'm getting the idea, Winger,
that you don't like me.

54:32.895 --> 54:36.105
Maybe I just don't know you
well enough yet, sarge.

54:36.273 --> 54:39.025
What do you say let's cut out
the bullshit between you and me?

54:39.193 --> 54:42.320
-Oh, let's.
-I think you're a punk.

54:43.030 --> 54:45.323
I've been in this Army 28 years.

54:45.866 --> 54:48.618
I've seen your kind come and go.

54:51.288 --> 54:54.457
You think you know something
about everything, don't you?

54:54.959 --> 54:56.542
Let me tell you something, mister.

54:56.710 --> 54:59.212
You don't know a damn thing
about soldiering.

54:59.380 --> 55:03.383
Oh, it's real tough stuff. Especially that
marching-in-a-straight-line business.

55:03.550 --> 55:07.011
I ain't talking about that crap! I'm
talking about something important.

55:07.179 --> 55:10.723
Like discipline and duty and honor
and courage. You ain't got none of it.

55:10.891 --> 55:15.687
Those words mean so much to a man
who scrubs garbage cans.

55:15.896 --> 55:18.356
Look, if you don't want me
in your Army, kick me out...

55:18.524 --> 55:21.401
...but get off my back.

55:23.904 --> 55:27.323
Maybe you'd like to
take a swing at me.

55:28.117 --> 55:31.911
I'd like to take a big swing
at you, sarge.

55:32.871 --> 55:35.581
Well, go ahead and
give it your best shot.

55:36.125 --> 55:39.043
I don't think I wanna go
to the stockade.

55:46.635 --> 55:49.262
I'll take my hat off.

55:54.351 --> 55:58.479
There we are, Winger.
Ain't no more drill sergeant.

55:58.647 --> 56:01.149
It's just you and me, kid,
man-to-man.

56:02.568 --> 56:05.153
So go ahead, give it
your best shot.

56:05.904 --> 56:07.905
Swing at me.

56:09.408 --> 56:10.992
Gutless.

56:11.827 --> 56:13.286
Punk.

56:26.633 --> 56:29.510
I'm willing to forget about
this little incident.

56:29.678 --> 56:32.263
And I want you to think
real hard about it.

56:32.681 --> 56:36.768
And maybe someday you'll understand
what the hell I'm talking about.

56:47.863 --> 56:50.615
No. No, don't stop.

56:50.866 --> 56:52.533
Don't stop.

56:52.993 --> 56:55.328
I'll still respect you.

56:55.496 --> 56:57.413
I'll respect you even more.

56:58.499 --> 57:00.708
Just use more whipped cream.

57:07.174 --> 57:09.884
John. John.

57:10.052 --> 57:13.054
I just had the weirdest dream. John.

57:16.892 --> 57:18.351
John?

57:29.613 --> 57:33.491
If I call Anita, she has to
pick me up at the train, right?

57:38.038 --> 57:40.665
I go back, get a new apartment...

57:40.833 --> 57:43.793
... I see if I can get
my cab job back.

57:58.267 --> 58:01.727
Where are you going? You going
AWOL? Are you going AWOL?

58:01.895 --> 58:03.855
-No, I'm deserting.
-You idiot!

58:04.022 --> 58:06.649
You desert now,
it's a federal offense.

58:06.817 --> 58:09.193
-Come on.
-I'll take my chances with the feds.

58:09.361 --> 58:11.445
Get up. Come on.
You're not going anywhere.

58:11.613 --> 58:14.407
Now listen to me.
You're gonna finish basic training...

58:14.575 --> 58:17.577
...you're gonna keep your mouth shut
and do everything he tells you.

58:17.744 --> 58:19.328
-And you know why?
-Why?

58:19.496 --> 58:24.250
Because you talked me into this,
that's why, you idiot! It was your idea!

58:24.418 --> 58:26.836
I didn't talk you into this.
You needed this.

58:27.004 --> 58:29.338
I'm gonna kill you! Damn you!

58:29.506 --> 58:33.259
Where's the great pay?
Where's the travel?

58:33.594 --> 58:37.722
Where's the Winnebago?
Goddamn it! Shit!

58:47.733 --> 58:49.984
This isn't what you think.

58:50.152 --> 58:51.736
No, we're just good friends.

58:52.946 --> 58:54.572
In the jeep.

58:56.366 --> 58:58.284
Come on. Let's go.

58:59.203 --> 59:02.496
I was going to the laundry,
get my uniform.

59:03.290 --> 59:04.624
Save it for later.

59:16.845 --> 59:19.513
Okay, guys, you're home.
Get out.

59:26.146 --> 59:29.106
You're not gonna report this
or anything, are you?

59:29.691 --> 59:32.318
I'm gonna treat it
like a UFO sighting.

59:32.486 --> 59:36.155
"I saw something, but I'm not
quite sure what it was."

59:36.823 --> 59:38.532
Thank you.

59:47.209 --> 59:48.960
Oh, goodbye.

01:00:19.533 --> 01:00:22.076
Move it! Do it!

01:00:30.210 --> 01:00:31.961
Why, boy...

01:00:33.046 --> 01:00:35.506
...we got women can climb that
better than you. Get up!

01:00:35.674 --> 01:00:37.550
Get on your feet!

01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:41.345
Hit it!

01:00:41.763 --> 01:00:44.473
He said he couldn’t make it.
Why don't you do it?

01:00:51.648 --> 01:00:54.233
Take one step back, Winger.

01:00:54.401 --> 01:00:56.193
Move it!

01:01:13.462 --> 01:01:17.673
All right, soldier, let's see
how you fire that mortar.

01:01:18.675 --> 01:01:20.843
-What coordinates, sir?
-Coordinates?

01:01:22.095 --> 01:01:24.180
Yes, sir. They determine
where the mortar's--

01:01:24.348 --> 01:01:28.059
Soldier, the Army has spent a lot of
money teaching you how to fire that.

01:01:28.226 --> 01:01:30.853
Now set it and fire it.

01:01:31.021 --> 01:01:35.441
-We don't know where the shell's--
-The only way to learn is to do it!

01:01:35.859 --> 01:01:37.568
Now fire the weapon.

01:01:45.118 --> 01:01:47.036
All right!

01:01:47.204 --> 01:01:50.748
Any of you suckholes want to
come up here and knock me off?

01:01:54.711 --> 01:01:56.128
Oh, shit.

01:01:58.673 --> 01:02:00.091
Incoming!

01:02:24.616 --> 01:02:27.993
Sergeant, does this mean
we're through for the day?

01:02:31.289 --> 01:02:32.915
-Save your strength, sarge.
-Yeah.

01:02:33.083 --> 01:02:35.418
Get him off! Get him off!

01:02:47.305 --> 01:02:52.268
Men, I realize this tragic injury
to your drill sergeant is a real shock.

01:02:52.436 --> 01:02:55.729
Especially this close to the end
of basic training.

01:02:56.690 --> 01:03:00.985
As far as I'm concerned, Sergeant
Crocker's 100 percent responsible...

01:03:01.153 --> 01:03:02.653
...for the entire thing.

01:03:02.821 --> 01:03:05.030
That's not what I heard.

01:03:05.198 --> 01:03:08.242
Who said that? Pick that up!
Who said that?

01:03:08.410 --> 01:03:10.035
-Did you say that?
-No, sir.

01:03:10.203 --> 01:03:13.164
-Did you say that? Who said--?
-I said that.

01:03:14.416 --> 01:03:16.083
Now, I don't care what you heard.

01:03:16.251 --> 01:03:19.587
My report states that Crocker was
negligent in his mortar instructions...

01:03:19.754 --> 01:03:21.797
...and totally unable to control
his men.

01:03:21.965 --> 01:03:24.967
Have it your way, sir.

01:03:25.135 --> 01:03:26.510
You bet I will, soldier.

01:03:26.678 --> 01:03:28.971
I do not want to hear one more
insubordinate word...

01:03:29.139 --> 01:03:30.848
...from anyone in this platoon.

01:03:31.016 --> 01:03:32.850
The subject is closed.

01:03:33.018 --> 01:03:35.603
You'd better stop worrying
about what happened to Hulka...

01:03:35.770 --> 01:03:39.732
...and start worrying about how you're
going to pass muster at graduation.

01:03:40.066 --> 01:03:42.401
You've got three days
to get it together.

01:03:43.528 --> 01:03:46.447
And if you want my honest opinion...

01:03:48.074 --> 01:03:50.201
...you're not gonna make it.

01:03:51.286 --> 01:03:52.786
No stragglers. Now come on.

01:03:52.954 --> 01:03:57.208
We owe it to Sergeant Hulka to end up
face down in the gutter tonight.

01:03:57.375 --> 01:03:59.084
Hey, baby, want to come
to my place?

01:03:59.252 --> 01:04:01.754
Where were you two blocks ago
when we could've used you?

01:04:01.922 --> 01:04:03.923
Come on. Don't waste it.

01:04:04.090 --> 01:04:06.884
All right, we're here!
Come on.

01:04:07.093 --> 01:04:09.929
It's the Pom Pom. It's famous.
It's world-famous.

01:04:20.774 --> 01:04:22.733
This might be fun.

01:04:23.693 --> 01:04:25.152
Hi.

01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:55.140
Oh, amazing.

01:04:55.642 --> 01:04:58.185
I used to wrestle.
There's no tables.

01:04:58.353 --> 01:05:01.438
-Here's a table. Excuse me.
-Sounds good.

01:05:01.606 --> 01:05:04.316
-You wrestled, huh? Nice seats.
-Yeah.

01:05:04.484 --> 01:05:06.777
Give me a kick, honey.

01:05:06.945 --> 01:05:08.404
Oh, parted my hair.

01:05:12.158 --> 01:05:14.451
Okay, girls, go get them!

01:05:46.693 --> 01:05:48.611
We're gonna start the bidding.

01:05:48.778 --> 01:05:51.989
I'm not gonna accept
anything less than $100.

01:05:52.157 --> 01:05:54.199
The bidding has gotta start.
Now give me 100.

01:05:54.367 --> 01:05:56.660
-You gotta do it for us, Ox.
-I can't.

01:05:56.828 --> 01:05:59.455
-You said you used to wrestle.
-I used to lose a lot.

01:05:59.623 --> 01:06:01.749
Yeah, but these are girls.
They're weak and soft.

01:06:01.916 --> 01:06:05.252
-I need 150!
-One-sixty!

01:06:05.420 --> 01:06:09.381
One-seventy-five now!
One-seventy-five here! One-eighty!

01:06:09.549 --> 01:06:11.884
-It doesn't seem fair.
-Fair?

01:06:12.052 --> 01:06:15.179
Who cares about fair?
The worId isn't fair! Truth isn't fair!

01:06:15.347 --> 01:06:18.223
Is it fair that you were
born like this? No!

01:06:18.391 --> 01:06:21.977
They're not expecting somebody
like you. They're expecting a slug.

01:06:22.145 --> 01:06:25.439
You're different. You're weird.
You're a mutant. You're a killer!

01:06:25.607 --> 01:06:27.358
You're a trained killer!

01:06:27.525 --> 01:06:30.903
You're a lean, mean,
fighting machine!

01:06:31.071 --> 01:06:32.655
I'll do it!

01:06:32.822 --> 01:06:36.241
-All right. Give me your money.
-Four hundred and thirteen bucks!

01:06:36.409 --> 01:06:40.871
My man. My big man here
is gonna do it all for us...

01:06:41.039 --> 01:06:43.666
...for $413...

01:06:43.833 --> 01:06:46.085
-And 58 cents.
-...and 58 cents!

01:06:46.252 --> 01:06:50.756
Four hundred thirteen dollars
and 58 cents!

01:06:51.341 --> 01:06:53.258
I'll take that right now!

01:06:58.431 --> 01:07:01.225
Ladies and gentlemen,
the big event you've been waiting for.

01:07:01.393 --> 01:07:05.145
A three-round match,
five-minute time limit, one pin only.

01:07:05.313 --> 01:07:08.440
And during this match
there will be absolutely no biting.

01:07:09.192 --> 01:07:10.776
Cut that out! Cut that out!

01:07:10.944 --> 01:07:13.612
And no pulling of the nose.

01:07:13.780 --> 01:07:17.366
Hey, do something about this, ref!
What kind of place you running here?

01:07:18.576 --> 01:07:21.120
And no kicking,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:07:21.287 --> 01:07:24.915
All right, go to your neutral corners,
and we will begin the match!

01:07:39.431 --> 01:07:41.598
Hey, wait a minute! Wait! Hey!

01:07:43.518 --> 01:07:45.310
Hey, just a second here!

01:07:55.947 --> 01:07:57.573
Oh, jeez! Now you done it.

01:08:02.996 --> 01:08:04.705
Beat the shit out of them, Ox!

01:08:04.873 --> 01:08:09.126
-You hit me! I'm a girl!
-I'm sorry! I didn't mean to hit you!

01:08:12.797 --> 01:08:15.132
That's my man out there!
My champ! Now stop it!

01:08:22.015 --> 01:08:25.017
Behind you!
Hey, she's not even in the fight.

01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:45.912
Cut that out. Cut that out.

01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:48.040
You get in here. Come on.

01:08:48.207 --> 01:08:49.957
I'm a gentleman. Now stop it.

01:08:50.126 --> 01:08:51.542
All right.

01:08:51.711 --> 01:08:53.754
Okay, all right.

01:08:53.921 --> 01:08:55.130
-Thanks.
-No problem.

01:08:55.298 --> 01:08:57.591
-Thanks again.
-Okay, all right.

01:08:57.759 --> 01:08:59.968
-You're very competitive.
-I don't wanna go back.

01:09:00.136 --> 01:09:03.221
You gotta go back.
You're already dirty. Come on.

01:09:04.557 --> 01:09:06.558
All right, there you go.

01:09:26.996 --> 01:09:29.413
They got him down
and they got him pinned!

01:09:36.381 --> 01:09:44.429
Bravo Company!

01:09:44.596 --> 01:09:46.223
Go, man!

01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:55.607
Way to go, Ox! Kill them!

01:10:24.387 --> 01:10:27.347
-Should we?
-Yeah. Let's go.

01:10:33.146 --> 01:10:35.022
We'll take care of these two.

01:10:35.648 --> 01:10:37.816
It's okay. Special assignment.

01:10:37.984 --> 01:10:39.443
Yeah, we're with them.

01:10:39.611 --> 01:10:43.322
Louise, it's so nice to see you.
What are you doing here?

01:10:45.992 --> 01:10:48.827
Well, explain yourselves.

01:10:52.624 --> 01:10:55.667
Well, sir, we were....

01:10:55.835 --> 01:10:57.753
We were going
to the Bingo parlor...

01:10:57.921 --> 01:10:59.963
...at the YMCA.

01:11:00.131 --> 01:11:02.758
Well, one thing led to another...

01:11:02.926 --> 01:11:05.344
...and the instructions
got all fouled up there.

01:11:05.511 --> 01:11:07.846
-We ended up--
-Shut up.

01:11:08.014 --> 01:11:09.514
Okay, sir.

01:11:12.477 --> 01:11:15.771
You men are a disgrace.

01:11:17.941 --> 01:11:22.027
Maybe a few days
in the stockade...

01:11:22.528 --> 01:11:26.615
...would help change
your rotten attitude.

01:11:26.866 --> 01:11:29.701
But we're supposed to
graduate tomorrow, sir.

01:11:31.162 --> 01:11:32.746
That's even better.

01:11:35.124 --> 01:11:39.211
Tomorrow you'll be on parade
in front of General Barnicke.

01:11:41.089 --> 01:11:44.549
And when he sees
what total fuck-ups you really are...

01:11:45.259 --> 01:11:47.552
... I will personally recommend...

01:11:48.054 --> 01:11:50.055
...that your whole platoon...

01:11:50.223 --> 01:11:54.226
...repeat the entire course
of basic training.

01:12:08.116 --> 01:12:09.741
Well, get out.

01:12:20.294 --> 01:12:23.255
All right, now this is the second time
we've let you guys off.

01:12:23.423 --> 01:12:26.258
So let's not let it happen a third time.
Is that clear?

01:12:26.426 --> 01:12:29.803
-Very clear.
-Get back to your barracks, all right?

01:12:29.971 --> 01:12:32.097
-Good night.
-Good night.

01:12:32.265 --> 01:12:35.058
So, what are you guys gonna do?

01:12:35.518 --> 01:12:38.937
We're gonna check out General
Barnicke's house. He's in Washington.

01:12:39.105 --> 01:12:40.605
Barnicke?

01:12:41.357 --> 01:12:42.733
Barnicke?!

01:12:42.900 --> 01:12:45.944
He still owes me money.
Hey, Barney!

01:12:47.113 --> 01:12:49.281
Get him!

01:12:50.116 --> 01:12:51.783
Mom! I'm home!

01:12:52.744 --> 01:12:53.994
John!

01:12:54.662 --> 01:12:58.623
-No, no.
-Now, don't worry about a thing, okay?

01:12:58.791 --> 01:13:01.168
Oh, this is nice, really.

01:13:02.754 --> 01:13:06.006
Listen, if this is gonna get you
in trouble, we'll leave. All right?

01:13:06.174 --> 01:13:09.551
No, it's okay. General Barnicke's
gone until tomorrow morning.

01:13:09.719 --> 01:13:11.136
Good.

01:13:13.431 --> 01:13:14.848
Thank you.

01:13:16.142 --> 01:13:19.227
I feel like I'm 16 years old
in my parents' house...

01:13:19.395 --> 01:13:21.605
...and they're away on a trip.

01:13:21.773 --> 01:13:24.649
Sixteen?
Wanna play Spin the Bottle?

01:13:24.984 --> 01:13:26.943
This guy's doing pretty well.
Interested?

01:13:27.111 --> 01:13:30.072
All right, you've looked at
the general's refrigerator long enough.

01:13:30.239 --> 01:13:33.325
-Let's go. Come on.
-Let's look at the general's cupboards.

01:13:33.493 --> 01:13:35.160
John!

01:13:35.995 --> 01:13:39.623
You know, you're very pretty...

01:13:40.416 --> 01:13:43.126
-...for a cop.
-Oh, thanks a lot.

01:13:43.294 --> 01:13:45.629
No, thank you. You know
what your problem is, baby?

01:13:45.797 --> 01:13:47.923
-No, I don't.
-Your problem is that you're armed.

01:13:48.091 --> 01:13:49.341
You're heavily armed.

01:13:49.509 --> 01:13:51.802
Guys have trouble with girls
that are armed.

01:13:51.969 --> 01:13:55.138
They don't know how to come on.
Do you know the rest of your problem?

01:13:55.306 --> 01:13:56.306
Tell me.

01:13:56.474 --> 01:13:59.059
You've never had anyone give you
the Aunt Jemima treatment.

01:13:59.227 --> 01:14:02.938
-No, I certainly haven't had that.
-First you get up on the grill.

01:14:04.357 --> 01:14:06.817
-I'll get you up to cruising speed.
-Stop it!

01:14:06.984 --> 01:14:11.196
You're sticking on the bottom, dear.
Keep hopping. Keep hopping, honey!

01:14:11.364 --> 01:14:14.032
There you go. A little bit lumpy.
You're a little bit lumpy.

01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:16.493
A little bit lumpy.

01:14:16.661 --> 01:14:20.038
-I'm not enjoying this! Now quit it!
-You're not, huh?

01:14:20.206 --> 01:14:22.040
Maybe you need this.

01:14:23.209 --> 01:14:26.586
-What are you gonna do with that?
-This. And this.

01:14:29.715 --> 01:14:32.425
Who's your friend?
Who's your buddy?

01:14:32.593 --> 01:14:33.635
I am, aren't I?

01:14:33.803 --> 01:14:35.720
-You're crazy about me, aren't you?
-No.

01:14:35.888 --> 01:14:37.764
You're head over heels in love
with me.

01:14:38.015 --> 01:14:40.976
You're hopelessly, deeply in love
with me, aren't you?

01:14:41.144 --> 01:14:42.435
Yes.

01:14:43.396 --> 01:14:46.148
I knew it. I had that feeling.

01:14:46.315 --> 01:14:48.733
Even before I picked this up.

01:14:50.069 --> 01:14:52.070
It's about time you came around.

01:14:52.864 --> 01:14:54.656
So, what do we do now?

01:14:55.491 --> 01:14:58.577
Let's go upstairs
and check out the general's closets.

01:15:02.415 --> 01:15:04.749
Nice to know you can
move like that when you have to.

01:15:04.917 --> 01:15:07.919
Well, it's nice to know
you can make me so hot.

01:15:08.087 --> 01:15:09.921
You say the nicest things.

01:15:10.089 --> 01:15:13.258
Hold on, honey.
I got a special tool for you.

01:15:13.426 --> 01:15:14.968
Come here.

01:15:17.805 --> 01:15:20.265
I can't believe we're pIaying this.

01:15:20.433 --> 01:15:23.518
-Okay, down on your knees.
-Sounds good.

01:15:24.770 --> 01:15:27.522
All right, now the way
that you play it is...

01:15:27.690 --> 01:15:31.109
...you pretend there's a force field
all around your body...

01:15:31.527 --> 01:15:35.363
...and you try and get as close
to each other as possible...

01:15:35.531 --> 01:15:38.074
...without actually touching.

01:15:38.242 --> 01:15:40.827
-Okay?
-It sounds easy.

01:15:42.788 --> 01:15:44.706
It ought to be.

01:15:51.964 --> 01:15:54.132
I think I'm good at this.

01:15:54.300 --> 01:15:56.301
Maybe.

01:15:56.469 --> 01:15:58.303
How do you win?

01:15:58.471 --> 01:16:01.640
Well, if somebody breaks
your force field, then you win.

01:16:03.601 --> 01:16:06.519
-You just broke my force field.
-Yeah, you win.

01:16:19.075 --> 01:16:21.618
Well, that was interesting.

01:16:23.246 --> 01:16:27.499
It's all over with now. We might as well
not even show up to graduation.

01:16:27.667 --> 01:16:30.085
You white guys'll probably
get five years.

01:16:30.253 --> 01:16:32.087
-But we gonna get hung.
-Yeah, man.

01:16:32.255 --> 01:16:34.965
Guys! Hey!

01:16:39.178 --> 01:16:40.804
What's everybody so down about?

01:16:40.972 --> 01:16:43.556
Didn't everybody make it
with a beautiful MP tonight, huh?

01:16:43.724 --> 01:16:47.602
Oh, Stillman freaked out
when the MPs brought us back.

01:16:47.770 --> 01:16:50.855
If we screw up graduation, we'll
have to take basics all over again.

01:16:51.023 --> 01:16:53.817
Oh, Cruise, it's been a lot of fun
the first time, hasn't it?

01:16:53.985 --> 01:16:56.695
I can't handle
basic training again, man.

01:17:00.283 --> 01:17:03.326
You're number one
on the death list now, Winger.

01:17:05.621 --> 01:17:08.373
Take it easy, Francis-- Psycho.

01:17:10.751 --> 01:17:14.045
Will you guys just relax? We got
plenty of time. What time is it now?

01:17:14.213 --> 01:17:16.506
-Two a.m.
-Okay, 0200.

01:17:16.674 --> 01:17:18.925
-What time we get up?
-Five a.m.

01:17:19.427 --> 01:17:24.264
0500. All right, we have three hours.
Didn't you ever cram for a test before?

01:17:26.684 --> 01:17:29.019
I learned two semesters
of geology in three hours.

01:17:29.186 --> 01:17:31.187
We can do this.
We just have to practice.

01:17:31.647 --> 01:17:34.232
We've been practicing all night,
and we stink.

01:17:34.692 --> 01:17:38.278
-Yeah, well, the brains have arrived.
-Yeah, that's good news.

01:17:38.988 --> 01:17:40.363
We go down to the motor pool.

01:17:40.531 --> 01:17:42.657
We work on it all night.
We get it together.

01:17:42.825 --> 01:17:46.411
-We can do this, right?
-There's no way in hell we can do it.

01:17:46.912 --> 01:17:48.747
Right shoulder, arms!

01:17:51.042 --> 01:17:53.543
Forward, arms!

01:17:53.711 --> 01:17:55.879
Inspection, arms!

01:17:57.965 --> 01:18:00.050
Right shoulder, arms!

01:18:01.385 --> 01:18:03.636
Right face!

01:18:04.305 --> 01:18:08.224
Your left, your left, your left.

01:18:08.392 --> 01:18:10.685
Come on, rhythm.
Hut, two, three, four.

01:18:10.853 --> 01:18:12.771
Black guys,
help the white guys, okay?

01:18:12.938 --> 01:18:16.775
-What did he say?
-He said the black guys...

01:18:16.942 --> 01:18:19.319
...help the white guys.

01:18:20.279 --> 01:18:22.197
Come on, guys!

01:18:22.365 --> 01:18:24.282
Wait a minute!

01:18:27.536 --> 01:18:29.788
Cut it out! Stop!

01:18:29.955 --> 01:18:32.040
Hey, stupid,
look at yourself!

01:18:32.208 --> 01:18:36.836
Cut it out! Cut it out! Cut it out!

01:18:37.630 --> 01:18:40.131
What the hell's
the matter with you?

01:18:40.633 --> 01:18:42.300
Stupid!

01:18:43.969 --> 01:18:45.970
We're all very different people.

01:18:46.138 --> 01:18:49.015
We're not Watusi.
We're not Spartans.

01:18:49.183 --> 01:18:52.477
We're Americans.
With a capital A, huh?

01:18:53.020 --> 01:18:54.604
You know what that means?

01:18:55.022 --> 01:18:57.857
Do you? That means
that our forefathers...

01:18:58.025 --> 01:19:01.694
...were kicked out of every
decent country in the world.

01:19:01.862 --> 01:19:05.490
We are the wretched refuse.

01:19:07.493 --> 01:19:10.620
We're the underdog.
We're mutts.

01:19:10.788 --> 01:19:14.666
-Here's proof. His nose is cold.
-So is his brain.

01:19:14.834 --> 01:19:17.877
But there's no animal
that's more faithful...

01:19:18.045 --> 01:19:22.507
...that's more loyal,
more lovable than the mutt.

01:19:22.675 --> 01:19:24.884
Who saw Old Yeller?

01:19:27.847 --> 01:19:30.974
Who cried when Old Yeller
got shot at the end?

01:19:31.725 --> 01:19:35.770
Nobody cried when Old Yeller
got shot? I'm sure.

01:19:37.648 --> 01:19:40.024
I cried my eyes out.

01:19:40.192 --> 01:19:41.526
Yeah.

01:19:42.027 --> 01:19:45.155
So we're all dogfaces.
We're all very, very different.

01:19:45.322 --> 01:19:48.158
But there is one thing
that we all have in common.

01:19:48.325 --> 01:19:53.163
We were all stupid enough
to enlist in the Army.

01:19:53.330 --> 01:19:54.747
We're mutants.

01:19:55.082 --> 01:19:59.586
There's something wrong with us,
something very, very wrong with us.

01:19:59.753 --> 01:20:02.046
Something seriously wrong with us.

01:20:02.214 --> 01:20:06.050
We're soldiers,
but we're American soldiers.

01:20:06.218 --> 01:20:10.763
We've been kicking ass for 200 years!
We're 10 and 1!

01:20:12.933 --> 01:20:15.768
Now we don't have to worry...

01:20:15.936 --> 01:20:18.897
...about whether or not
we've practiced.

01:20:19.064 --> 01:20:20.899
We don't have to worry...

01:20:21.066 --> 01:20:23.776
...about whether Captain Stillman
wants to have us hung.

01:20:23.944 --> 01:20:26.446
All we have to do...

01:20:26.614 --> 01:20:30.408
...is to be the great American
fighting soldier...

01:20:31.327 --> 01:20:34.037
...that is inside each one of us.

01:20:35.498 --> 01:20:37.415
Now, do what I do...

01:20:39.460 --> 01:20:42.420
...and say what I say...

01:20:45.382 --> 01:20:47.592
...and make me proud.

01:20:49.094 --> 01:20:52.055
-Fall in!
-Yeah!

01:20:53.265 --> 01:20:54.724
Platoon...

01:20:56.727 --> 01:20:58.645
...ten-hut!

01:21:00.940 --> 01:21:03.650
Right shoulder, ho!

01:21:05.194 --> 01:21:07.111
Order, ho!

01:21:30.177 --> 01:21:32.136
Maybe they couldn't find
the parade grounds.

01:21:32.304 --> 01:21:35.139
-It's right in front of the barracks.
-That's what I mean.

01:21:43.857 --> 01:21:46.150
Eyes right!

01:21:48.988 --> 01:21:51.155
We checked the barracks, sir.
They're not there.

01:21:51.323 --> 01:21:55.159
If they're not here in five minutes,
I want them arrested.

01:22:07.506 --> 01:22:11.092
Hey, graduation's at 2:00.
What time is it now?

01:22:12.886 --> 01:22:15.013
Three o’clock. We've still got
an hour to sleep.

01:22:15.180 --> 01:22:17.140
Oh, good.

01:22:17.308 --> 01:22:20.268
Three o’clock! We're missing it!

01:22:21.437 --> 01:22:25.064
John! John!
We're missing graduation.

01:22:25.232 --> 01:22:27.942
-We're missing it.
-Let's go.

01:22:28.110 --> 01:22:30.028
Wake up, man! We're missing it.

01:23:00.100 --> 01:23:02.060
Where is it?

01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:55.113
All right, let's do
a little singing this morning.

01:24:08.460 --> 01:24:10.670
Oh, my God!

01:24:36.363 --> 01:24:37.989
Platoon...

01:24:40.159 --> 01:24:42.368
...a-one, two:

01:24:50.627 --> 01:24:53.379
Where the hell
have you been, soldier?

01:24:53.547 --> 01:24:56.674
-Training, sir!
-Training, sir!

01:24:56.967 --> 01:24:58.760
What kind of training, son?

01:24:58.927 --> 01:25:03.347
Army training, sir!

01:25:04.183 --> 01:25:07.727
Platoon, just like last night,
only better!

01:25:07.895 --> 01:25:11.439
And right shoulder, ho!

01:25:13.317 --> 01:25:15.234
Order, ho!

01:25:16.737 --> 01:25:18.404
Side step right!

01:25:30.042 --> 01:25:32.293
Left flank, left!

01:25:37.216 --> 01:25:39.675
Queen Anne salute!

01:25:41.553 --> 01:25:43.930
Three, five, seven!

01:25:49.353 --> 01:25:51.354
Razzle-dazzle!

01:25:51.522 --> 01:25:53.898
Hut, two, three, four!

01:25:55.192 --> 01:25:56.859
Hut, two, three, four.

01:25:57.027 --> 01:26:01.405
The quick brown fox jumped
over the lazy dog, sir!

01:26:13.669 --> 01:26:17.922
-Where's your drill sergeant, men?
-Blown up, sir!

01:26:18.090 --> 01:26:19.966
Blown up, sir!

01:26:21.969 --> 01:26:26.722
Sir, these are Sergeant Hulka's men.
He was injured during basic training.

01:26:26.890 --> 01:26:28.599
I see.

01:26:28.767 --> 01:26:32.186
So am I to understand that you men
completed your training on your own?

01:26:32.354 --> 01:26:35.940
-That's the fact, Jack!
-That's the fact, Jack!

01:26:36.275 --> 01:26:37.942
-Captain.
-Yes, sir?

01:26:38.193 --> 01:26:40.069
These are exactly
the kind of go-getters...

01:26:40.237 --> 01:26:42.947
... I want working on my EM-50
project in Italy.

01:26:44.074 --> 01:26:46.701
-Oh, but, sir, these men--
-Don't "but" me, captain.

01:26:46.869 --> 01:26:49.537
I want them on the plane tonight.

01:26:50.455 --> 01:26:54.083
Gentlemen, it's party time,
Italian style!

01:27:15.314 --> 01:27:17.315
Not bad! It's great.

01:27:18.150 --> 01:27:22.278
Best bunk? Best bunk is....

01:27:22.446 --> 01:27:24.405
Best bunk, right here.

01:27:26.491 --> 01:27:29.410
-Okay, who's up for the Vatican?
-No, I can't.

01:27:29.578 --> 01:27:32.830
Let's get some people
and some relics, and we'll do it.

01:27:33.832 --> 01:27:37.877
What are you doing? No, get off.
See, you gotta make my bunk.

01:27:38.045 --> 01:27:40.129
See, we're in ltaly.
The guy on the top bunk...

01:27:40.297 --> 01:27:43.466
...has gotta make the guy
on the bottom's bed all the time.

01:27:43.634 --> 01:27:45.801
It's in the regulations.
If we were in Germany...

01:27:45.969 --> 01:27:47.303
... I would have to make yours.

01:27:47.471 --> 01:27:50.306
But we're in Italy, so you've
gotta make mine. It's regulations.

01:27:51.183 --> 01:27:53.184
Who's gonna make the beds?

01:27:53.352 --> 01:27:56.187
Buona sera, gentlemen.

01:27:58.148 --> 01:28:00.816
It is alive.

01:28:11.370 --> 01:28:13.287
Welcome to Italy.

01:28:14.790 --> 01:28:18.084
We can forget all about
the tearful reunion.

01:28:19.294 --> 01:28:23.631
There's a couple things I want to get
straight with you right off the bat.

01:28:23.799 --> 01:28:27.635
I don't know what kind of shit
you pulled at graduation...

01:28:27.803 --> 01:28:31.055
...but this ain't
no glamour detail we're on.

01:28:31.848 --> 01:28:33.766
I want to see you walking tall...

01:28:33.934 --> 01:28:36.978
...looking good and mentally alert
at all times.

01:28:37.396 --> 01:28:38.729
I'm gonna bust your butts...

01:28:38.897 --> 01:28:42.483
...to make this the best damned outfit
in the European command.

01:28:44.820 --> 01:28:49.156
Get these bunks made up!
Get your gear stored!

01:28:49.324 --> 01:28:52.868
We're gonna muster in front
of the motor pool at 0600! Got it?

01:28:53.620 --> 01:28:55.246
Hi, sarge.

01:28:57.249 --> 01:29:00.167
"Hi, sarge." Just shut up.

01:29:00.335 --> 01:29:02.169
0600!

01:29:15.267 --> 01:29:17.184
As you may know,
General Barnicke...

01:29:17.352 --> 01:29:20.062
...is particularly interested
in this project.

01:29:21.356 --> 01:29:25.776
He has selected this platoon
for this assignment...

01:29:26.862 --> 01:29:30.197
...and he expects you to perform
particularly well.

01:29:31.616 --> 01:29:33.576
Raise it, sergeant.

01:29:36.872 --> 01:29:41.500
Gentlemen, this is the EM-50
Urban Assault Vehicle.

01:29:48.592 --> 01:29:52.053
A real beauty, colonel.
You can count on us.

01:30:01.688 --> 01:30:03.272
Fall in!

01:30:08.862 --> 01:30:11.447
I need two volunteers.

01:30:11.615 --> 01:30:12.990
You and you.

01:30:13.158 --> 01:30:16.786
You'll guard this vehicle
until 0800 on Monday morning...

01:30:16.953 --> 01:30:19.455
...and the rest of you
got the weekend off. Dismissed!

01:30:26.922 --> 01:30:30.299
-Sarge, why me?
-Oh, I don't know, son.

01:30:30.467 --> 01:30:33.761
I ain't got no military reason for it,
I just don't like you.

01:30:34.554 --> 01:30:36.806
Have a nice weekend.

01:30:37.557 --> 01:30:42.269
Oh, yeah. I want that so clean
I could eat off the floor.

01:30:51.113 --> 01:30:55.825
This is amazing. You wouldn't believe
what this thing could do.

01:31:00.539 --> 01:31:04.166
John.

01:31:05.377 --> 01:31:09.255
-Do you think I'm officer material?
-God, I'm worried about you.

01:31:09.422 --> 01:31:11.799
Come on. I'm in good shape.
I'm walking tall.

01:31:11.967 --> 01:31:14.844
I'm looking good.
First weekend in Europe.

01:31:15.011 --> 01:31:19.056
Yeah. We're spending it in
an airplane hangar watching a truck.

01:31:19.224 --> 01:31:20.724
We got each other.

01:31:20.892 --> 01:31:24.061
Well, I was kind of thinking we'd get
a couple companions this weekend.

01:31:24.271 --> 01:31:26.313
Too bad the girls
are in Germany.

01:31:26.481 --> 01:31:27.773
We could get...

01:31:27.941 --> 01:31:29.775
-...a hotel room somewhere.
-Yeah.

01:31:29.943 --> 01:31:31.777
Spend a couple days
eating room service.

01:31:31.945 --> 01:31:33.737
Would've been good.

01:31:33.905 --> 01:31:37.825
We could take them up in the Alps
for a little spin.

01:31:43.748 --> 01:31:45.082
-No.
-Oh, yeah.

01:31:45.250 --> 01:31:47.751
-No, no, no.
-Oh, yeah.

01:31:47.919 --> 01:31:51.088
-Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
-No, no. No, John, no.

01:31:51.256 --> 01:31:53.090
-I'll drive.
-Okay.

01:32:00.098 --> 01:32:01.599
We're here.

01:32:01.766 --> 01:32:04.268
Don't forget, you promised me
a real expensive dinner...

01:32:04.436 --> 01:32:06.854
...before we see this
whatever it is.

01:32:07.022 --> 01:32:08.689
Right.

01:32:13.945 --> 01:32:15.863
Come with me, my dear.

01:32:23.288 --> 01:32:27.625
Now, don't forget, this is a big secret,
so you can't tell anybody, okay?

01:32:27.792 --> 01:32:31.420
-Not unless they torture me.
-Come on.

01:32:32.380 --> 01:32:35.633
-Official business.
-May I see your identification, sir?

01:32:35.800 --> 01:32:37.927
Thank you, captain.

01:32:38.094 --> 01:32:41.430
Yeah. Just follow me.

01:32:44.976 --> 01:32:48.896
When the Army entrusts an important
project like this to an officer...

01:32:49.064 --> 01:32:53.943
...it usually means they're priming him
for a major promotion.

01:32:58.823 --> 01:33:02.868
-I really think you're gonna like this.
-Yeah?

01:33:11.002 --> 01:33:15.172
-Are you gonna get sick or something?
-Where the fuck's my truck? Where--?

01:33:16.675 --> 01:33:18.676
Where's my truck? Hey!

01:33:19.302 --> 01:33:22.012
Hey, where's the EM-50?

01:33:22.180 --> 01:33:24.723
A couple of soldiers took it
to get it washed, sir.

01:33:24.891 --> 01:33:26.517
Took it to get it washed?!

01:33:26.685 --> 01:33:29.353
Is there a bathroom around here?
I gotta pee.

01:33:29.521 --> 01:33:31.355
-HoId it!
-They had proper ID, sir.

01:33:31.523 --> 01:33:34.358
Do you want me to notify
post security, sir?

01:33:34.526 --> 01:33:37.194
You keep your mouth shut about this.
Do you understand me?

01:33:37.362 --> 01:33:40.781
And you let no one in there.
No one! Not even the colonel!

01:33:40.949 --> 01:33:42.199
Yes, sir.

01:33:47.330 --> 01:33:49.832
You know, I think this guy
Stillman is really dangerous.

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.167
Yeah, I'm becoming
aware of that, you know.

01:33:54.337 --> 01:33:57.381
Okay, let's go.
Let's load that truck.

01:33:57.549 --> 01:33:58.966
Sergeant.

01:34:00.176 --> 01:34:01.719
We've traced the EM-50 to Germany.

01:34:01.886 --> 01:34:04.096
They're probably heading
right for East Berlin.

01:34:04.264 --> 01:34:07.349
Sir, if you'll take my advice,
there's a crack squad in the 42nd...

01:34:07.517 --> 01:34:09.143
...that could link up
with Air Recon.

01:34:09.311 --> 01:34:11.645
We'd have that EM-50 back here
inside of 24 hours.

01:34:11.813 --> 01:34:14.106
Nothing doing.
We'd be the laughingstock...

01:34:14.274 --> 01:34:17.109
...of the entire armed forces.
We will do this ourselves.

01:34:17.277 --> 01:34:19.945
Sir, those numb-nuts can't
even tie their own shoelaces.

01:34:20.113 --> 01:34:23.866
I don't care, sergeant. Just load
the truck, and let's move out.

01:34:25.035 --> 01:34:27.369
All right, we're moving out!
Move!

01:34:28.955 --> 01:34:30.831
I guess we're going after
John and Russell.

01:34:30.999 --> 01:34:33.417
I can't believe
they're Russian spies. Can you?

01:34:33.585 --> 01:34:36.920
All I know is,
I finally get to kill somebody.

01:34:57.942 --> 01:34:59.777
Hey, Russell.

01:35:01.279 --> 01:35:03.697
Have you been doing
your special exercises?

01:35:03.865 --> 01:35:06.575
-I brought the magic suitcase.
-You did?

01:35:06.910 --> 01:35:09.787
Does this do anything for you?
French girls do it all the time.

01:35:09.954 --> 01:35:11.789
No. I've seen that.

01:35:12.457 --> 01:35:15.292
I've seen that on cable TV,
and it did nothing for me.

01:35:15.460 --> 01:35:17.920
Hey, watch it. A guy could get hurt.

01:35:21.424 --> 01:35:24.885
-My gosh, my gosh.
-Come on, John.

01:35:25.720 --> 01:35:27.679
-Come on.
-I'll do it!

01:35:27.847 --> 01:35:30.140
But just one more time.

01:35:31.476 --> 01:35:33.936
Off the low meter board.

01:35:34.521 --> 01:35:38.148
From the United States
Military Academy, John Winger.

01:35:38.608 --> 01:35:40.567
He's gonna do a reverse mo-fo.

01:35:44.489 --> 01:35:46.990
A somersault up to the knees,
to a butt banister...

01:35:47.158 --> 01:35:48.450
...a backflip...

01:35:48.618 --> 01:35:50.452
...all the way back,
a double backflip.

01:35:50.620 --> 01:35:53.664
A face bounce!
A double face bounce!

01:35:53.832 --> 01:35:56.667
A triple head! Oh, no!
Oh, he's hurt!

01:35:58.670 --> 01:36:00.254
That does sound nice.

01:36:00.422 --> 01:36:02.548
You know, my father was here
during the war.

01:36:02.715 --> 01:36:05.759
-In this bathtub?
-Your ears need cleaning.

01:36:05.927 --> 01:36:10.347
Easy. Louise,
what do you think of me?

01:36:10.849 --> 01:36:14.977
When we first met, I thought
you were kind of screwed up.

01:36:16.479 --> 01:36:17.771
And now?

01:36:17.939 --> 01:36:20.691
I still think you're kind of screwed up,
Russell...

01:36:20.859 --> 01:36:23.360
...but you're so cute.

01:36:23.528 --> 01:36:25.446
-A face bounce...
-John.

01:36:25.613 --> 01:36:27.614
...a dismount...

01:36:28.533 --> 01:36:30.659
...and a remount.

01:36:30.952 --> 01:36:32.369
John!

01:36:33.955 --> 01:36:36.081
How's this? How's this?

01:36:36.458 --> 01:36:37.875
-How's this for you?
-Perfect.

01:36:38.042 --> 01:36:40.878
-Is this good? Is this good?
-It's great. Oh, it's perfect.

01:36:41.045 --> 01:36:45.007
-What about this? How about this?
-That's better. Oh, so much better.

01:36:45.967 --> 01:36:47.593
Oh, I like that.

01:36:48.136 --> 01:36:49.470
That's different.

01:36:54.309 --> 01:36:57.769
Oh, where did you learn that?
Oh, where did you learn that?

01:37:00.565 --> 01:37:04.526
Oh, not yet. Please, not yet!
Oh, please!

01:37:04.694 --> 01:37:07.529
I can't stop! Please!

01:37:08.740 --> 01:37:11.450
Oh, I wanted it-- Oh, I'm sorry!

01:37:12.327 --> 01:37:16.246
-I can't see a thing up ahead, sir.
-The turnoff is just up to the right.

01:37:16.414 --> 01:37:18.248
No, sir. If we turn right,
we're gonna--

01:37:18.416 --> 01:37:23.295
Sergeant, when I want your input,
I will ask for it. Thank you.

01:38:13.012 --> 01:38:15.180
For chrissakes, captain.
We broke through the--

01:38:15.348 --> 01:38:19.851
This is my mission. I would appreciate
if you let me run it. Thank you.

01:38:22.105 --> 01:38:23.105
Fuck this.

01:38:34.325 --> 01:38:36.994
-Where you going, sarge?
-Hey, sarge, where are you going?

01:38:37.161 --> 01:38:39.997
Sarge, what are you doing?
Sarge, what are you doing?!

01:39:20.580 --> 01:39:24.708
Here you go. There you go.
Hand them off there, boys.

01:39:24.876 --> 01:39:26.835
Stupid jerks.

01:40:24.268 --> 01:40:26.937
Gunther, get yourself
a new Volkswagen, huh?

01:40:28.356 --> 01:40:32.150
Folks, don't order the schnitzel.
They're using schnauzer.

01:40:33.569 --> 01:40:36.655
Hey, Hansel, Gretel!
Hey, we're your allies.

01:40:36.823 --> 01:40:39.366
It's cool. All right.

01:40:39.534 --> 01:40:42.369
All right, Klaus,
hold it up right here.

01:40:42.537 --> 01:40:45.122
We got some naked animals in here
we don't want you to see.

01:40:45.289 --> 01:40:46.832
Here you are.

01:40:49.210 --> 01:40:51.002
-More worthless money for you.
-Come on.

01:40:51.170 --> 01:40:54.089
-All right.
-Hey, did you leave the radio on?

01:40:54.257 --> 01:40:56.049
-What?
-That's the shortwave radio.

01:40:56.342 --> 01:40:58.135
This is the EM-50?

01:41:03.808 --> 01:41:05.976
Mayday, mayday.

01:41:06.602 --> 01:41:11.231
Mayday. Code 21, Status 7.
Mayday. Code 21, Status 7.

01:41:11.399 --> 01:41:13.024
Code 21. Go ahead.

01:41:13.192 --> 01:41:17.696
I'm with the U.S. Army, 41st
Armored Division, Bravo Company.

01:41:17.864 --> 01:41:21.116
I have a platoon and CO
being held by hostile enemy...

01:41:21.284 --> 01:41:25.996
...at coordinates 41 6-397.

01:41:26.164 --> 01:41:29.040
They're Russian troops,
about 200.

01:41:29.208 --> 01:41:32.335
Send help. I gotta get moving.

01:41:33.546 --> 01:41:36.923
416-397.
That's Czechoslovakia.

01:41:38.259 --> 01:41:41.553
-Forty-first Armored?
-Yeah, Bravo Company.

01:41:43.431 --> 01:41:46.308
-That's our unit.
-Oh, no.

01:41:46.601 --> 01:41:49.853
-They came looking for us.
-Oh, they've had it.

01:41:50.021 --> 01:41:51.688
We've had it.

01:41:51.856 --> 01:41:54.691
If it's a Status 7 like you said,
they went in undercover.

01:41:54.859 --> 01:41:57.694
So the DOD won't even
acknowledge it.

01:41:57.862 --> 01:41:59.738
Those guys are dead.

01:42:01.282 --> 01:42:03.074
-We gotta go get them.
-Yeah.

01:42:03.242 --> 01:42:06.203
-No.
-We're responsible.

01:42:06.370 --> 01:42:08.580
-Russell.
-Come on, it's Czechoslovakia.

01:42:08.748 --> 01:42:11.291
We zip in, we pick them up
and we zip right out again.

01:42:11.459 --> 01:42:13.794
We're not going to Moscow.
It's Czechoslovakia.

01:42:13.961 --> 01:42:15.796
It's like going into Wisconsin.

01:42:15.963 --> 01:42:18.882
I got the shit kicked out of me
in Wisconsin once. Forget it.

01:42:21.719 --> 01:42:24.221
-Russell, what are you afraid of?
-I'm not afraid.

01:42:24.388 --> 01:42:26.890
There are two things I promised
myself I'd never do:

01:42:27.058 --> 01:42:28.558
Kill and die.

01:42:28.726 --> 01:42:30.936
What if the Russians were
raping your sister?

01:42:31.103 --> 01:42:34.356
Come on, you know my sister.
You practically raped her one night.

01:42:34.524 --> 01:42:37.025
The Russians would just have to
buy her dinner.

01:42:37.193 --> 01:42:41.404
Russell, that is our platoon out there.
That's Ox and Elmo and Cruiser.

01:42:41.572 --> 01:42:44.658
I love those guys.
We're their only chance.

01:42:44.826 --> 01:42:47.786
Two things, John:
First of all, they hate your guts.

01:42:47.954 --> 01:42:49.621
Those bastards.

01:42:49.789 --> 01:42:53.667
Second, when I finish all my training,
I'm probably gonna be a typist.

01:42:53.835 --> 01:42:56.294
Now, when you invade
a hostile foreign nation...

01:42:56.462 --> 01:42:59.256
...you don't send your typists
in the first wave.

01:42:59.423 --> 01:43:03.510
They got guys who like to do that,
John. Let's give them a call, okay?

01:43:05.721 --> 01:43:07.305
Okay.

01:43:08.140 --> 01:43:09.933
Yeah, we won't go in.

01:43:10.518 --> 01:43:13.270
-Okay.
-Okay, let's go.

01:43:13.437 --> 01:43:15.355
Oh, my hero.

01:43:17.567 --> 01:43:20.527
Damn it, though, we're so close.
I'd love to just go take a look.

01:43:20.695 --> 01:43:24.614
I mean, the Iron Curtain, it's gotta look
great. I'd love to have a picture of it.

01:43:24.782 --> 01:43:26.366
Think we could do that?

01:43:26.534 --> 01:43:30.036
Take about an hour. We could drive
over, get pictures and come back.

01:43:30.204 --> 01:43:32.664
-We'll just look?
-Yeah.

01:43:34.458 --> 01:43:37.878
-Okay. Let's look.
-Yeah, that's a much better plan.

01:44:04.280 --> 01:44:07.908
We're so damn lost.
Where the hell is Innsbruck, Austria?

01:44:08.075 --> 01:44:10.368
We're trying to get over there,
do some skiing.

01:44:12.830 --> 01:44:15.332
-Do you know Brandy? Hi, girls.
-Excuse me.

01:44:15.499 --> 01:44:18.501
-What a darling border guard.
-Is there a bathroom here?

01:44:18.669 --> 01:44:21.004
Bathroom, girls. Bathroom.

01:44:21.172 --> 01:44:23.173
There must be a bathroom
here somewhere.

01:44:23.341 --> 01:44:25.091
Bathroom. Bathroom.

01:44:28.971 --> 01:44:32.349
Hi. I'm John Winger
of the United States Army...

01:44:32.516 --> 01:44:35.226
-...and you are my prisoner.
-Why are you doing this?

01:44:37.480 --> 01:44:38.813
Chicago.

01:44:40.191 --> 01:44:43.193
Why do we want prisoners?
What do we want with prisoners?

01:44:43.361 --> 01:44:45.403
Come on, move!

01:44:50.534 --> 01:44:52.869
Do the words "act of war"
mean anything to you, huh?

01:44:53.037 --> 01:44:57.374
-I have a plan.
-Great. Custer had a plan too.

01:45:48.134 --> 01:45:49.718
We are in serious troubIe.

01:45:49.885 --> 01:45:52.804
He said he had a plan.
Now, just give him a chance.

01:45:53.222 --> 01:45:55.056
Hello, hello!

01:46:07.486 --> 01:46:11.072
What an idiot.
Get in here.

01:46:18.622 --> 01:46:20.915
-All right, we're in.
-Nice work, John.

01:46:26.130 --> 01:46:28.423
-What's the plan?
-I'm working on it.

01:46:28.591 --> 01:46:31.301
Oh, my God, what an idiot.
He's working on it.

01:46:33.804 --> 01:46:35.680
The absence of a plan is ridiculous.

01:46:35.848 --> 01:46:37.724
Hey, they're about
to start shooting at us.

01:46:37.892 --> 01:46:40.477
-Good. That's fine. Let them.
-It's working.

01:46:49.820 --> 01:46:53.156
-Louise, get this thing moving.
-You're dangerous, you know that?

01:46:57.119 --> 01:46:59.037
Oh, this is interesting.

01:47:04.752 --> 01:47:08.505
I got it figured this way: They got
one big gun, a couple of tanks.

01:47:08.672 --> 01:47:11.758
They got a hundred Baryshnikovs
running around.

01:47:11.926 --> 01:47:14.010
-And what do we got?
-What do we got?

01:47:14.178 --> 01:47:17.806
We got one heavily armed
recreational vehicle here, man.

01:47:17.973 --> 01:47:20.350
Okay, find that truck,
and we find them.

01:47:31.028 --> 01:47:33.446
-There's a gun in that tower, Russell.
-I see him.

01:47:36.367 --> 01:47:38.368
All right, steady, steady.

01:47:49.880 --> 01:47:52.382
-Got him!
-All right! Oh, God!

01:47:56.345 --> 01:47:58.388
Good one, Russell.

01:48:00.558 --> 01:48:03.059
-There's the truck.
-Must be them. Get ready!

01:48:07.064 --> 01:48:08.606
Out, please!

01:48:15.990 --> 01:48:18.533
John, over here!

01:48:39.597 --> 01:48:41.973
-That was stupid.
-Yeah.

01:48:45.769 --> 01:48:47.312
-You know who would love this?
-Who?

01:48:47.479 --> 01:48:49.856
Russell. He should be here.

01:48:50.024 --> 01:48:51.441
-Russell!
-Russell!

01:48:51.609 --> 01:48:53.359
Help!

01:49:02.953 --> 01:49:05.288
-Thank you.
-That helped.

01:49:15.549 --> 01:49:17.467
They'd better be in there.

01:50:11.105 --> 01:50:13.022
You can beat me
as much as you want!

01:50:21.573 --> 01:50:23.908
-Are you okay?
-Where are they?

01:50:24.076 --> 01:50:26.703
-Hi.
-Where are the others?

01:50:29.039 --> 01:50:30.623
Hello?

01:50:34.545 --> 01:50:36.254
Hello!

01:50:36.547 --> 01:50:38.423
Hello?

01:50:39.133 --> 01:50:40.967
-Hello?
-Hello.

01:50:41.135 --> 01:50:44.053
-Who is it?
-It's Idi Amin.

01:50:44.221 --> 01:50:46.556
-It's Winger!
-We're free!

01:50:46.724 --> 01:50:49.642
It's us, Winger! Get us out!

01:50:49.810 --> 01:50:52.228
All right, stand back from the door.
I'm gonna blow it.

01:50:52.396 --> 01:50:54.689
Everybody back! Everybody back!

01:50:57.026 --> 01:50:58.401
Get it.

01:51:01.155 --> 01:51:02.613
Get down.

01:51:12.041 --> 01:51:16.336
-Whoa, tough door!
-You got it locked on the inside?

01:51:16.503 --> 01:51:20.423
It's because of you people
that I cannot get outside!

01:51:20.591 --> 01:51:23.801
It's always your fault.
You are not capable of handling--

01:51:23.969 --> 01:51:25.845
To take orders from me, who is--

01:51:26.013 --> 01:51:30.099
-Open this door, pIease!
-I'm gonna squash him!

01:51:35.230 --> 01:51:39.776
-Winger! Oh, I'm so glad!
-What are you doing here?

01:51:58.379 --> 01:52:01.130
Look out, Louise!
There's a tank behind us! Move it!

01:52:26.782 --> 01:52:28.658
Find John, will you?
I'm gonna kill him.

01:53:14.079 --> 01:53:16.205
We had a car waiting.

01:53:20.836 --> 01:53:22.962
Russell?

01:54:03.337 --> 01:54:05.630
Let's get out of here!

01:54:30.239 --> 01:54:32.073
We're here!

01:54:34.117 --> 01:54:35.284
John!

01:54:35.452 --> 01:54:37.203
Come on!

01:54:42.960 --> 01:54:46.629
You are in trouble!
This is government property--

01:55:35.178 --> 01:55:37.013
Something's blocking the road.
Hang on!

01:55:37.180 --> 01:55:38.389
Hang on!

01:55:41.476 --> 01:55:44.103
I'm getting too old for this shit!

01:55:52.654 --> 01:55:55.865
Gentlemen, we are in Germany!

01:56:12.758 --> 01:56:15.593
I hate tourist season.

01:56:16.178 --> 01:56:22.391
Such a truck would be good
for picking up girls in Minsk.

01:57:06.061 --> 01:57:09.355
Platoon, ten-hut!

01:57:11.024 --> 01:57:13.401
Queen Anne salute!

01:57:15.946 --> 01:57:17.154
Get up!

01:57:32.629 --> 01:57:35.381
Thank you.
It's great to be back home.

01:57:57.362 --> 01:57:59.822
My people, we're number one.
All right.

01:58:07.414 --> 01:58:10.833
Ox, we got medals. Look.
Valortorious Service. Thank you.

01:58:13.754 --> 01:58:16.922
What the--? A surprise party!

01:58:17.090 --> 01:58:20.676
I'll kill you. Whose idea was this?

01:58:20.844 --> 01:58:24.346
All right, everybody's coming
to my place. This is ridiculous.

01:58:24.890 --> 01:58:27.266
Senator, hang onto that,
will you, for me?

01:58:27.434 --> 01:58:30.728
Oh, I wrote.
I didn't know if you'd come.

01:58:31.188 --> 01:58:33.022
No questions, please.

01:58:33.190 --> 01:58:35.274
We just want to get back
to our hotel rooms...

01:58:35.442 --> 01:58:37.860
...and have some really serious sex.

01:58:40.530 --> 01:58:43.824
What are you looking at?
Keep your eyes out there.

01:59:03.136 --> 01:59:05.846
Oh, you old dog.

01:59:42.300 --> 01:59:44.677
Right face!

01:59:45.053 --> 01:59:47.221
Forward march!

01:59:48.765 --> 01:59:52.768
Left, left, left, right, left.

01:59:58.775 --> 02:00:00.776
Five, six, seven, eight.
