CHARLIE:
 <i>It freaked him out.</i>

40:47.534 --> 40:50.400
Tell him I'll bring him
a present.

40:50.400 --> 40:52.234
 <i>So did I get any good mail?</i>

40:52.234 --> 40:53.968
Um,

40:55.467 --> 40:57.234
well,

40:57.234 --> 40:59.901
you may have won
a vacation home in Guadalupe.

40:59.901 --> 41:01.901
Ha. Great.

41:01.901 --> 41:03.767
I'm still getting issues
of <i>Modern Macramé</i>

41:03.767 --> 41:05.467
from the last time
I almost won.

41:07.834 --> 41:08.934
What's for dinner?

41:08.934 --> 41:12.667
Kung Pao chicken with extra MSG.
You?

41:12.667 --> 41:16.567
Um, aspartame
and Red Dye No. 2.

41:16.567 --> 41:18.434
[CHUCKLES]

41:20.267 --> 41:23.701
So how'd it go
with the stucco guy?

41:25.033 --> 41:28.000
Um, he wanted to
make it into a remodel,

41:28.000 --> 41:31.334
but I eventually got him
to talk him out of his vision

41:31.334 --> 41:33.367
and patch the hole.

41:35.534 --> 41:36.701
[SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]

41:36.701 --> 41:38.734
[CAR DOOR OPENS]

41:45.767 --> 41:46.767
Hey.

41:46.767 --> 41:48.133
Hey.

41:50.234 --> 41:51.767
So you're ready to roll, huh?

41:51.767 --> 41:55.601
Yeah, in a few.

41:55.601 --> 41:58.968
So, um, how's the--?
How's the jeep?

41:58.968 --> 42:01.033
Ah, it drives.

42:01.033 --> 42:03.067
It has a bit of a shimmy
if you get over 60,

42:03.067 --> 42:06.267
but that's probably
a good thing.

42:08.434 --> 42:10.033
That it?

42:20.868 --> 42:23.033
[***]

42:23.033 --> 42:24.534
I just wanted to say,

42:24.534 --> 42:27.400
um,

42:27.400 --> 42:30.234
you know, take care of yourself.

42:30.234 --> 42:32.334
Yeah.

42:33.400 --> 42:34.601
You too.

42:36.634 --> 42:37.901
Okay.

42:37.901 --> 42:40.634
So...

42:43.033 --> 42:46.167
 <i>* It's amazing *</i>

42:46.167 --> 42:51.801
 <i>* How, with the blink</i>
 <i>Of an eye *</i>

42:51.801 --> 42:55.000
 <i>* A picture may fade *</i>

42:55.000 --> 42:58.400
 <i>* But fail to say goodbye *</i>

42:59.834 --> 43:03.067
 <i>* Little miracles *</i>

43:03.067 --> 43:07.300
 <i>* Within the cornerstone *</i>

43:07.300 --> 43:11.434
 <i>* Next in line</i>
 <i>The debts are mine *</i>

43:11.434 --> 43:13.901
Later.

43:13.901 --> 43:18.234
 <i>* Little miracles</i>
 <i>Are all I own *</i>

43:18.234 --> 43:20.801
 <i>* Little miracles *</i>

43:20.801 --> 43:24.701
 <i>* Are all I own *</i>
