(grunting)

00:22.041 --> 00:23.709
Hey, Ninja-nomicon.

00:23.792 --> 00:25.625
Guess whose ridiculous
waterfall challenge

00:25.709 --> 00:29.917
is about to get got!
Boom! Yours.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.083
(shouting)

(groaning)

00:33.875 --> 00:35.000
What?
(shouting)

00:40.959 --> 00:42.625
What does
climbing a waterfall

00:42.709 --> 00:44.417
have to do with
kicking butt anyway?

00:44.500 --> 00:46.083
I should be learning
awesome fighting moves

00:46.166 --> 00:48.083
like ultimate punches
and ultimate kicks,

00:48.166 --> 00:50.959
and ultimate kick-punches.

00:51.041 --> 00:52.750
Hmm. Really?

00:52.834 --> 00:53.959
(fish squeaking)

00:54.041 --> 00:55.625
How am I gonna be
a master ninja

00:55.709 --> 00:57.917
if I spend all my time
getting fish-slapped?

00:58.000 --> 01:01.166
"The tiger who refuses
to get his paws wet

01:01.250 --> 01:02.917

01:03.000 --> 01:05.959
I don't want to catch fish,
I want to punch them.

01:06.041 --> 01:09.250
Not punch fish,
I want to punch bad guys.

01:09.333 --> 01:12.375
So to you I say,
a cannonball.

01:15.792 --> 01:18.458
I'm so sick of not getting
straight answers from the Nomicon.

01:18.542 --> 01:21.000
-(toilet flushing)
-Sounds like you've got a McQuestion.

01:21.083 --> 01:23.208
-A McWhat?
-Allow me to McSplain.

01:23.291 --> 01:24.834
Thanks to my new McFist Pad,

01:24.917 --> 01:27.583
I have the entire Internet
in my pocket.

01:27.667 --> 01:31.041
Ask anything, anything at all.
McFist Pad, go!

01:31.125 --> 01:32.375
What does becoming
a master ninja

01:32.458 --> 01:34.709
have to do with
wet tiger paws?

01:34.792 --> 01:38.041

01:50.125 --> 01:52.417
Brock Octane's Tiger Paw.

01:52.500 --> 01:55.083
Is exactly the kind
of straightforward

01:55.166 --> 01:58.375
super Bruce move the Nomicon
should be teaching me.

01:58.458 --> 01:59.583
(toilet flushing)

01:59.667 --> 02:01.500
The McFist Pad
is way less confusing

02:01.583 --> 02:03.125
than the Nomicon.

02:03.208 --> 02:04.917
(McFist Pad) <i>Don't forget</i>

02:09.000 --> 02:11.166
All right, Mr. Grumpy,
it's me against you.

02:11.250 --> 02:12.792
One of us
is getting flushed.

02:12.875 --> 02:14.750
And this time
it's not gonna be me!

02:14.834 --> 02:16.333
(straining)

02:16.417 --> 02:18.542
That ain't the funny sound
I'm used to hearing.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.667
Upside down six?

02:21.750 --> 02:24.792
Hey, I got that same number on
the back of my football jersey.

02:24.875 --> 02:27.166
<i>You have arrived</i>
<i>at your destination.</i>

02:27.250 --> 02:30.875
How did we ever find our
lockers before McFist Pad?

02:30.959 --> 02:32.875
I don't know and
I don't wanna know.

02:32.959 --> 02:34.709
Guess who's gonna be surprised
when they find out

02:34.792 --> 02:37.083
I've already mastered
the Ninja Tiger Paw?

02:37.166 --> 02:38.500
Here's a hint.
It's square

02:38.583 --> 02:39.834
with a little ninja
in the middle,

02:39.917 --> 02:42.000
and it's not
in my backpack!

02:42.083 --> 02:43.583
It's in here,
it's gotta be in here.

02:43.667 --> 02:45.542
Oh, man, it's not in here!
I gotta find it.

02:45.625 --> 02:47.709
Why? We have
the McFist Pad now.

02:47.792 --> 02:50.375
It's an 800-year-old book
of secret ninja wisdom.

02:50.458 --> 02:52.834
I don't have 800 years
of secret wisdom, do you?

02:52.917 --> 02:56.000
I have to get it back.
To the bathroom!

02:56.083 --> 02:57.083
I'll be here.

03:00.083 --> 03:01.917
(gasping) Seriously?

03:02.000 --> 03:04.333
My arch-enemy's stepson,
are you kidding me?

03:04.417 --> 03:05.875
(bell ringing)

03:05.959 --> 03:07.917
(gasping)

03:08.000 --> 03:10.041
Bash! Bash,
what up, bro?

03:10.125 --> 03:11.792
Hey, that book you
found in the bathroom?

03:11.875 --> 03:13.083
It's actually mine, and, um...

03:13.166 --> 03:15.250
-What book?
-Hmm?

03:18.959 --> 03:21.041
-(yelling) What did you do with it?!
-Get off of me!

03:21.125 --> 03:23.709
I gave all my books to
the homework-doing kid.

03:23.792 --> 03:25.166
The one what does
everybody's homework.

03:25.250 --> 03:27.959
Homework-doing kid?
Homework-doing kid.

03:28.041 --> 03:30.208
Bucky! To the library.

03:30.291 --> 03:32.792
(muttering)
Ooh, that's nice.

03:32.875 --> 03:34.375
Oh, that book
looked like it had

03:34.458 --> 03:35.959
non-school board
approved ideas in it

03:36.041 --> 03:37.834
so I gave it
to the principal.

03:37.917 --> 03:38.959
To the principal's office!

03:39.041 --> 03:40.417
(muttering)

03:42.625 --> 03:44.709
Oh, that book was too big
for my Word Gobbler.

03:44.792 --> 03:46.917
-(gasping)
-So, I gave it to Coach Green

03:47.000 --> 03:48.125
for flamethrower practice.

03:48.208 --> 03:49.291
To the gym!

03:49.375 --> 03:50.667
(muttering)

03:51.667 --> 03:53.125
(shouting) No!

03:54.750 --> 03:57.000
Nomicon.
Is it really you?

03:57.083 --> 03:59.500
McFist Pad suggested
I check the Lost and Found.

03:59.583 --> 04:01.166
And look who I found.

04:01.250 --> 04:03.625
(laughs) How awesome
is McFist Pad?

<i>-♪ McFist Pad, wow ♪</i>

04:05.083 --> 04:06.208

my blinky buzzy book.

04:08.500 --> 04:09.417
(gasping)

04:12.166 --> 04:16.208
Ah! The sacred book of Ninja
just got into McFist's limo.

04:17.250 --> 04:19.041
You know what you
gotta do now, right?

04:19.125 --> 04:21.375
-Go get the Nomicon.
-Go get some ice cream.

04:21.458 --> 04:24.250
Right. You Nomicon,
and me ice cream.

04:24.333 --> 04:25.625
Want me to
get you something?

04:26.667 --> 04:28.458
(chuckling)
Oh, right, right.

04:28.542 --> 04:30.375
It'll melt.
You go. Go.

04:30.458 --> 04:31.875
I'll figure out
this ice cream thing.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.166

04:46.583 --> 04:48.917
-Hey, monkey.
-My name's Frank.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.375
No. Your name's...
(makes chimp sounds)

04:51.458 --> 04:52.458

04:52.542 --> 04:53.917

04:54.000 --> 04:56.041

05:19.083 --> 05:20.792
Hey, guy who works
for McFist.

05:20.875 --> 05:21.875
I been looking for you.

05:21.959 --> 05:25.542
So you want me to cover
this beautiful antique book

05:25.625 --> 05:27.583
with blinkers and buzzers?
Why?

05:27.667 --> 05:29.125
I'm gonna use it
as a doorstop.

05:29.208 --> 05:30.875
I like the door open
when I poop.

05:30.959 --> 05:33.875
TMI, Bash.
Too much ickiness.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.917
And I won't stand for it.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.417
That boy can't tell me what to do.

05:37.500 --> 05:39.166
I'm a world-class
evil genius.

05:39.250 --> 05:41.875
I could atomize him.
I could protonize him.

05:41.959 --> 05:43.500
I could tell his step-daddy.

05:43.583 --> 05:45.917
Yep, evil genius.

05:47.959 --> 05:49.875
Hannibal. A word?

05:49.959 --> 05:52.500
Viceroy, I'm kind of
in a meeting right now.

05:52.583 --> 05:55.125
Ooh, that's a nice-looking
doorstop you've got there.

05:55.208 --> 05:56.959
Silence, you fools!

05:57.041 --> 06:00.000
There is a Ninja
to be destroyed.

06:00.083 --> 06:01.792
(gasps) The Sorcerer.

06:01.875 --> 06:03.250
No honkin' way!

06:03.333 --> 06:04.959
Yeah, Viceroy,
focus on that.

06:05.041 --> 06:07.333
I'm just here
about the doorstop.

06:07.417 --> 06:10.417
That's no doorstop.

06:10.500 --> 06:11.417
Oh, boy.

06:11.500 --> 06:12.625
(muttering)

06:12.709 --> 06:15.458
That's the Ninja-Nomicon!

06:15.542 --> 06:16.792
And there it is.

06:16.875 --> 06:19.000
What's he talking about?

06:19.083 --> 06:21.917
It is the Ninja's book
of ancient knowledge.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.208
We can learn the secrets
of his powers.

06:25.291 --> 06:28.750
And his weaknesses.

06:28.834 --> 06:30.500
Give me that!

06:30.583 --> 06:34.083
(grunting)

06:34.166 --> 06:37.166
Sir, let me
take a whack at it.

06:44.041 --> 06:44.959
Hang in there, Nomicon.

06:46.709 --> 06:48.834
-(all shouting)
-Enough of this!

06:48.917 --> 06:50.375
I'll do it myself.

06:50.458 --> 06:52.834
(muttering)

06:55.500 --> 06:58.000
-(roaring)
-(squeaking)

07:03.125 --> 07:04.583
(both shouting)

07:04.667 --> 07:06.750
Is that stank?
What the juice?

07:07.959 --> 07:10.083
(McFist shrieks)

07:12.083 --> 07:13.041
(gasping)

07:16.000 --> 07:19.583
(Randy) Oh, he's
stanking up the pages!

07:19.667 --> 07:20.875
Enough of that.

07:20.959 --> 07:23.417
-It's Ninja time!
-Ninja?

07:23.500 --> 07:24.542
-Sorcerer.
-Ninja?

07:24.625 --> 07:25.709
-McFist.
-Hello.

07:25.792 --> 07:27.834
You've got something
that belongs to me.

07:27.917 --> 07:28.875
Ninja Snatch!

07:28.959 --> 07:30.750
(groaning)

07:31.792 --> 07:34.333
Destroy him!

07:36.125 --> 07:39.000
Get ready to taste
Ninja Tiger Paw.

07:39.083 --> 07:42.667
(makes roaring sound)

07:42.750 --> 07:45.208
-(all laughing)
-Huh?

07:45.291 --> 07:47.000
OK, so maybe the McFist Pad

07:47.083 --> 07:48.959
isn't the best place
to learn ninja moves.

07:49.041 --> 07:50.250
Ha! What you don't know

07:50.333 --> 07:51.959
is that Viceroy
designed my office

07:52.041 --> 07:53.917
for exactly this kind
of confrontation!

07:54.000 --> 07:55.041
Well, now he knows.

07:57.542 --> 07:59.000
(shouting)

08:02.750 --> 08:04.750
OK, no.
No, I can do this.

08:04.834 --> 08:06.709
It's just like climbing
the old waterfall.

08:06.792 --> 08:09.834
This is nothing like
climbing the waterfall!

08:11.083 --> 08:12.625
(grunts)

08:14.083 --> 08:16.208
(shouting)

08:16.291 --> 08:17.709
(chuckles) Ninja Dodge.

08:17.792 --> 08:20.000
You're gonna have to do
better than that...

08:20.083 --> 08:22.792
(grunts) I take it back.
That was pretty good.

08:22.875 --> 08:24.625
You knocked me down
with a big hammer.

08:24.709 --> 08:25.667
Gut him!

08:26.875 --> 08:29.875
I present to you...
the Ninja!

08:29.959 --> 08:31.959
Now, about my reward.

08:32.041 --> 08:36.000
After centuries entombed
in this filthy hole,

08:36.083 --> 08:39.458
I will be free,
and chaos will reign.

08:39.542 --> 08:40.875
And my reward?

08:42.208 --> 08:43.542
(squeaking)

08:43.625 --> 08:45.500
(grunting)

08:45.583 --> 08:49.125
The Nomicon did not
prepare me for this.

08:49.208 --> 08:52.875
"The tiger who refuses
to get his paws wet

08:52.959 --> 08:53.959
catches no fish."

08:54.041 --> 08:55.917
We're way past
wet paws here.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.125
Why can't you teach me
something useful!

09:00.041 --> 09:01.000
(gasping)

09:02.417 --> 09:04.500
"A ninja must master
the art of stealth."

09:04.583 --> 09:06.792
"Believe in the weapon
that is in the suit."

09:06.875 --> 09:09.041
Everything you've
taught me is useful.

09:09.125 --> 09:12.917
Sorcerer, the Ninja's been
kicking your butt for 800 years,

09:13.000 --> 09:15.792
and he'll be kicking it
for 800 more.

09:15.875 --> 09:17.208
(grunting)
Ninja Air Kick!

09:18.834 --> 09:20.291
What are you
standing around for?

09:20.375 --> 09:21.917
Attack! He's over there.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.417
-Conceal.
-Uh, where'd he go?

09:24.500 --> 09:26.834
-Reveal.
-Ah, now he's over there!

09:26.917 --> 09:28.750
"Believe in the weapon
that is in the suit."

09:33.542 --> 09:34.500
(Sorcerer) Get him!

09:36.709 --> 09:40.083
Feel my wrath!

09:42.083 --> 09:44.166
Ninja Sprint!

09:45.834 --> 09:47.917
"The best way
to avoid an attack

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
is to avoid an attack."

09:54.041 --> 09:56.875
(panting) What you got there,
plate of cookies?

09:56.959 --> 09:58.625
-Hey!
-Not anymore.

09:58.709 --> 10:00.375
My eatin' circles!
(shouts)

10:00.458 --> 10:01.667
(all laughing)

10:03.792 --> 10:05.834
(gasps)

10:05.917 --> 10:08.583
Ninja Tengu Fire Ball!

10:11.083 --> 10:12.667
And then I sliced
through the grate,

10:12.750 --> 10:13.709
jumped out a window,

10:13.792 --> 10:15.125
caught the 2:30
cross-town bus,

10:15.208 --> 10:16.166
and here I am.

10:16.250 --> 10:18.208
Wow! You are hardcore,
Cunningham.

10:18.291 --> 10:20.542
I would never
take the bus.

10:20.625 --> 10:23.000
You weren't the only one
who had an epic afternoon.

10:23.083 --> 10:26.583
McFist Pad and I took my grave
punchin' to the next level, yo.

10:26.667 --> 10:28.333
Check out these moves.

10:30.125 --> 10:31.417
What are you doing?

10:31.500 --> 10:33.750
I've gotta get my paws wet.

10:33.834 --> 10:34.875
(grunts)

10:37.125 --> 10:40.041
Nomicon, whatever you say.
No matter how confusing

10:40.125 --> 10:43.000
or stupid or ridiculous,
I am in.

10:43.083 --> 10:46.166
I'm all about getting
my Master Ninja on.

10:46.250 --> 10:48.125
Aw, the waterfall?
Really?

10:48.208 --> 10:50.000
-Again?
-(thunder cracks)

10:50.083 --> 10:51.083
I'm going.

10:51.166 --> 10:53.417
(grunts)
I so got this.

10:53.500 --> 10:54.917
(grunts)

10:55.000 --> 10:57.792
Come on, Nomicon.
That all you got?

11:01.583 --> 11:02.834
(Randy) Don't feel bad.

11:02.917 --> 11:04.709
Who knew I could
defeat 70 robo-apes?

11:04.792 --> 11:08.125
I didn't even know!
But now it's just you and I.

11:08.208 --> 11:09.875
I think it's you and me.

11:09.959 --> 11:11.125
Less grabbing,
more stabbing!

11:12.375 --> 11:13.834
(Randy exclaiming)

11:13.917 --> 11:15.917
(muttering)

11:16.000 --> 11:17.959
Oil-drinking baboons!

11:18.041 --> 11:19.875
All a disgrace!

11:21.750 --> 11:22.667
Help him!

11:22.750 --> 11:24.417
But my leg came off. Whoa.

11:24.500 --> 11:27.834
Oh! My leg came off.
Boo-hoo!

11:29.583 --> 11:31.625
Man, your boss
is kind of a jerk.

11:31.709 --> 11:34.291
It's his company.
What can you do?

11:34.375 --> 11:37.250
I wouldn't take it.
I'd fight back.

11:37.333 --> 11:39.083
But hey, that's just me.

11:41.333 --> 11:42.625
Smoke bomb!

11:42.709 --> 11:44.375
-You make me sick!
-(exclaims)

11:46.000 --> 11:48.959
I'd kick the rest of you,
but I have somewhere to be.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.625
(Randy whistling)

11:53.709 --> 11:55.625
(video game music playing)

11:57.667 --> 12:00.750
-(panting)
-Sorry I'm late, Howard.

12:00.834 --> 12:03.667
And because I almost made us
miss the grand opening

12:03.750 --> 12:05.208
of the Barf-A-Centauri,

12:05.291 --> 12:08.333
I will pay for all your snacks
as an apology.

12:09.750 --> 12:11.500
You know I'm not
actually late, right?

12:11.583 --> 12:13.750
Apology accepted,
Cunningham.

12:13.834 --> 12:15.208
(McFist) I don't know
where I was

12:15.291 --> 12:16.667
when I came up
with the idea

12:16.750 --> 12:20.125
to build the most puke-tastic
coaster in history.

12:20.208 --> 12:23.750
I know I was at the day spa
getting a mud pack and a facial

12:23.834 --> 12:25.500
when I came up with it.

12:25.583 --> 12:28.250
But the important
thing is, I did.

12:28.333 --> 12:30.667
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you

12:30.750 --> 12:33.625
"Mission to Barf-A-Centauri!"

12:33.709 --> 12:34.917
(all cheering)

12:35.000 --> 12:36.959
Hannibal McFist
can do no wrong!

12:37.041 --> 12:38.583
You know he just tried
to kill me, right?

12:38.667 --> 12:40.750
OK, so he can do
a little wrong.

12:40.834 --> 12:43.750
And joining us for
the inaugural blast-off,

12:43.834 --> 12:46.542
Norrisville's favorite
space monkey,

12:46.625 --> 12:49.667
Neil Apestrong.

12:49.750 --> 12:51.542
(all cheering)

12:51.625 --> 12:53.709
(chittering)

12:58.041 --> 13:01.208
I'm apestrong nuts
for Apestrong!

13:01.291 --> 13:04.208
(robo-ape) Bad enough getting your head
taken off by the Ninja.

13:04.291 --> 13:07.291
But then to have your butt
chewed out by McFist.

13:07.375 --> 13:09.750
He's the boss.
What can we do?

13:11.750 --> 13:13.250
(Randy) <i>I'd fight back.</i>
<i>I'd fight back.</i>

13:13.333 --> 13:14.500
<i>I'd fight back.</i>

13:14.583 --> 13:16.875
Ninja is right.
We have to fight back.

13:16.959 --> 13:18.667
If we stop working,

13:18.750 --> 13:20.250
business would
grind to a halt.

13:20.333 --> 13:22.750
Today, we bring McFist
to his knees.

13:22.834 --> 13:25.041
Today, we strike.

13:27.458 --> 13:28.542
(all) Strike!

13:29.875 --> 13:30.875
(ringing)

13:35.750 --> 13:37.291
Strike, strike!

13:39.208 --> 13:40.333
(all screaming)

13:40.417 --> 13:42.542
(all shouting) Strike!

13:45.166 --> 13:47.208
(Marci) Look at that
adorable monkey.

13:47.291 --> 13:48.834
He's having
the time of his life.

13:48.917 --> 13:51.417
Yeah!
That popped ape face!

13:51.500 --> 13:54.250
(Howard) We are about to barf
at six G's, Cunningham.

13:54.333 --> 13:55.917
Six G's!

13:56.000 --> 13:57.834
To think we will have
achieved something so great,

13:57.917 --> 13:59.458
at such a young age.

13:59.542 --> 14:03.208
So I said to myself, "Willem,
what's it matter if no one knows

14:03.291 --> 14:05.125
-you created Barf-A-Centauri?
-(snoring)

14:05.208 --> 14:07.041
As long as you
get to ride it."

14:07.125 --> 14:08.917
What's up with
the robo-apes?

14:09.000 --> 14:09.917
(all chanting) Strike!

14:10.000 --> 14:11.709
(Randy) They're walking
off the job.

14:11.792 --> 14:13.959
Oh, my ninja,
they're on strike!

14:14.041 --> 14:16.917
You know, I'm the one who told
them to stand up for themselves.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.125
-That was me.
-(both grunting)

14:19.208 --> 14:21.250
(Howard) What's going
on with the ride?

14:22.667 --> 14:24.750
Yo, McFist.
This thing stinks.

14:24.834 --> 14:26.250
I didn't puke at all!

14:26.333 --> 14:28.083
Where do you think
you're going?

14:28.166 --> 14:30.083
(all chanting) Strike!

14:30.166 --> 14:32.875
(groaning)
Hang on, folks.

14:32.959 --> 14:35.208
We'll have you
puking momentarily.

14:35.291 --> 14:37.750
We're experiencing
a minor malfunction.

14:37.834 --> 14:39.208
-Oh, that's no malfunction.
-(snoring)

14:39.291 --> 14:40.875
Those robo-apes
are in Strike Mode.

14:40.959 --> 14:44.291
Strike Mode! Why on earth would
you give them a Strike Mode?!

14:44.375 --> 14:45.667
The more important
question is,

14:45.750 --> 14:47.709
why would they use
Strike Mode?

14:47.792 --> 14:50.083
No. I think
the important question

14:50.166 --> 14:51.750
is why would you
give it to them?!

14:51.834 --> 14:53.750
Somebody must have put
the idea in their heads

14:53.834 --> 14:55.625
that they're being
treated poorly.

14:55.709 --> 14:57.375
Cunningham,
thanks to you,

14:57.458 --> 14:59.792
we're not gonna get to ride
the Barf-A-Centauri.

14:59.875 --> 15:01.667
You have to fix this!

15:01.750 --> 15:03.166
Why would I fix it?

15:03.250 --> 15:04.667
If the robo-apes
are on strike,

15:04.750 --> 15:06.291
they're not coming
after the Ninja.

15:06.375 --> 15:08.208
I drank a yellow
McHyper-Slush,

15:08.291 --> 15:10.667
and ate a bag
of blue McSwizzlers.

15:10.750 --> 15:13.750
I'm not leaving
until I spew green.

15:13.834 --> 15:16.041
I would love to see that.

15:16.125 --> 15:18.667
(both) Looks like I got
a strike to stop.

15:19.625 --> 15:22.375
Commander, will you
sign my butt?

15:22.417 --> 15:23.959
(chittering)

15:24.041 --> 15:25.375
(all chanting)
Fist is a McMeanie!

15:25.458 --> 15:26.750
(Randy) Smoke bomb!

15:26.834 --> 15:28.792
OK, robo-apes,
you're angry, I get it.

15:28.875 --> 15:30.542
But there's a boy
up there with a dream

15:30.625 --> 15:31.917
to puke off a rollercoaster,

15:32.000 --> 15:33.583
and there's another boy
with a dream

15:33.667 --> 15:36.125
of watching that first boy's
dream come true.

15:36.208 --> 15:38.792
The only thing crushing
those dreams is you.

15:38.875 --> 15:40.500
But you said fight back.

15:40.583 --> 15:42.709
After you run the coaster.

15:42.792 --> 15:45.625
I mean, come on.
Is McFist really that bad?

15:45.709 --> 15:48.250
Get back to work,
you knuckle-dragging refrigerators!

15:48.333 --> 15:50.375
And somebody
destroy the Ninja!

15:53.083 --> 15:55.875
My cyber-simian brothers,

15:55.959 --> 15:58.041
it is time to activate...

15:58.125 --> 16:00.041
...Ape Mode!

16:02.166 --> 16:03.750
Ape Mode?
What's Ape Mode?

16:03.834 --> 16:05.000
(all screeching)

16:05.083 --> 16:07.375
Oh, Ape Mode.

16:07.458 --> 16:09.000
Yeah, this is bad.

16:20.959 --> 16:23.208
(screeching)

16:36.792 --> 16:37.834
(laughing)

16:37.917 --> 16:40.291
There's only
one thing to do.

16:40.375 --> 16:41.375
-Run!
-Fight!

16:55.333 --> 16:57.583
Please let that be
chocolate ice cream.

16:57.667 --> 17:00.542
And I'm saying, once I've
puked my guts out,

17:00.625 --> 17:02.667
I'll take the controls so
you can toss your cookies.

17:02.750 --> 17:04.792
How do I know
I can trust you?

17:04.875 --> 17:08.875
A situation like this requires
a certain faith in humanity.

17:08.959 --> 17:09.792
OK, deal.

17:09.875 --> 17:12.000
Why did you
give them Ape Mode?!

17:17.000 --> 17:18.792
You're gonna
fix that, right?

17:23.583 --> 17:24.834
(exclaims)

17:34.625 --> 17:35.917
Fix it yet?

17:36.000 --> 17:37.333
I'm trying to,

17:37.417 --> 17:39.667
but some kid won't
stop talking to me.

17:39.750 --> 17:41.375
You want me to say
something to him?

17:41.458 --> 17:43.125
(shouting)

17:55.625 --> 17:56.875
(shouting)

17:58.792 --> 18:00.458
-There's too many of them.
-(McFist) You.

18:00.542 --> 18:03.667
Banana-eating,
oil-drinking baboons.

18:03.750 --> 18:06.834
But wait a second.
They're mad at McFist.

18:06.917 --> 18:08.667
Only he could stop this.

18:08.750 --> 18:11.375
(groans) I have to
ask McFist for help?

18:11.458 --> 18:13.834
Go on.
Have your little uprising.

18:13.917 --> 18:15.291
Nothing you do
can hurt me!

18:15.375 --> 18:17.166
-(Marci) Hannibal!
-(Bash) My cotton candy!

18:17.250 --> 18:18.750
-Don't hurt Marci!
-Hannibal!

18:18.834 --> 18:22.250
And the kid.
Can't forget Bash.

18:22.333 --> 18:25.542
Help! Need some help here!

18:25.625 --> 18:28.583
Not from you!
Anybody else. Help!

18:28.667 --> 18:30.834
I'm not crazy about
this either, McFist.

18:30.917 --> 18:32.125
But innocent people
are in danger.

18:32.208 --> 18:34.083
(Marci screaming)

18:35.166 --> 18:37.583
Fine.
Just get it over with!

18:37.667 --> 18:38.667
Hi-ya!

18:39.166 --> 18:40.542
It ain't pretty,

18:40.625 --> 18:42.000
but this way
we can ride together.

18:42.083 --> 18:44.375
Join me for
an inaugural puke.

18:45.875 --> 18:48.834
Sorry, gents.
We need that coaster.

18:50.208 --> 18:52.250
Oh, come on!

18:52.333 --> 18:54.166
-(Marci screaming)
-(roaring)

18:54.250 --> 18:56.083
Ninja Snatch!

18:57.250 --> 18:58.417
Thanks, Ninja.

18:58.500 --> 19:00.458
Aw, I wanted to sit
in the front seat.

19:00.542 --> 19:02.709
OK, they're safe,
but this isn't over.

19:02.792 --> 19:04.250
-(all shouting)
-(growling)

19:05.625 --> 19:07.542
It's time to apologize.

19:07.625 --> 19:09.166
Can't you just
stab 'em or something?

19:09.250 --> 19:11.041
No, we can't stab...
They're mad at you.

19:11.125 --> 19:13.542
The only way to end this is
for you to say you're sorry.

19:13.625 --> 19:15.583
With words.

19:15.667 --> 19:17.250
(all screaming)

19:19.166 --> 19:20.667
Just say it.

19:20.750 --> 19:22.875
Hannibal McFist
doesn't apologize.

19:22.959 --> 19:24.875
-(roaring)
-OK, fine.

19:24.959 --> 19:26.333
Handle it your way.

19:26.417 --> 19:28.000
OK, OK.

19:28.083 --> 19:29.583
(McFist) Sometimes
I say things,

19:29.667 --> 19:31.542
and sometimes
those things are hurtful.

19:31.625 --> 19:33.166
So I guess what I'm
really trying to say is...

19:33.250 --> 19:35.250
(muttering)

19:35.333 --> 19:36.250
So that's not a word.

19:36.333 --> 19:38.792
Yeah, all right, fine.

19:38.875 --> 19:41.750
I'm sorry, OK?

19:41.834 --> 19:43.291
(roaring)

19:45.792 --> 19:46.750
Help, help!

19:48.959 --> 19:50.417
I don't get it.

19:50.500 --> 19:52.125
I really thought
that was gonna work.

19:57.750 --> 20:00.583
(shouting)

20:00.667 --> 20:02.083
(all chittering)

20:02.166 --> 20:04.917
Ape Mode. They only
understand monkey speak.

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
We need someone
who speaks monkey speak!

20:13.625 --> 20:16.083
Apestrong.
Norrisville needs you.

20:16.166 --> 20:17.834
-(chittering)
-Yes, again.

20:18.792 --> 20:20.500
Tell the robo-apes
McFist is sorry,

20:20.583 --> 20:21.792
and he'll never
yell at them again.

20:21.875 --> 20:23.750
(yelling) Yes, I'll
never yell again!

20:23.834 --> 20:25.500
(roaring)

20:25.583 --> 20:28.375
-(chittering loudly)
-(all chittering)

20:37.834 --> 20:40.083
Apology accepted.

20:40.166 --> 20:42.625
(all screaming)

20:44.792 --> 20:46.500
(sobbing)

20:46.583 --> 20:47.709
Whoops.

20:47.792 --> 20:50.875
-(ringing)
-(roaring)

20:50.959 --> 20:52.750
McFist Industries.

20:52.834 --> 20:54.709
How may I direct your call?

20:56.834 --> 20:58.583
(vomiting)

20:58.667 --> 21:00.750
Nice working
with you, Commander.

21:00.834 --> 21:01.709
(chittering)

21:01.792 --> 21:04.417
(groaning) What?

21:04.500 --> 21:06.750
You're welcome.
Smoke bomb!

21:06.834 --> 21:08.000
I never said thank you!

21:08.083 --> 21:10.083
-Yeah!
-Viceroy.

21:10.166 --> 21:13.041
You're not riding anything
until you remove Strike Mode,

21:13.125 --> 21:15.583
Ape Mode, and any other
ridiculous modes

21:15.667 --> 21:17.583
-from the robo-apes.
-(clearing throat)

21:17.667 --> 21:20.000
Even Brownie Hound
Suck-Up Mode?

21:20.083 --> 21:22.208
Keep that one for
when I'm feeling blue.

21:22.291 --> 21:23.333
(groaning)

21:23.417 --> 21:25.041
I will barf for you!

21:25.125 --> 21:27.834
Oh, I see how it is.
I'm gone for five minutes,

21:27.917 --> 21:29.625
and you got
a new puking pal?

21:29.709 --> 21:32.750
(Howard) Really wanna go there,
Cunningham? 'Cause technically,

21:32.834 --> 21:34.375
you already rode this thing
without me.

21:34.458 --> 21:36.834
(Randy) It was official Ninja business.
I didn't even enjoy it.

21:36.917 --> 21:39.208
Although turn three
is the cheese.

21:39.291 --> 21:41.500
You're ruining it again!

21:42.709 --> 21:43.917
(shouting)

21:44.000 --> 21:47.125
-(vomiting)
-So beautiful!

21:47.750 --> 21:49.250
(theme music playing)

22:05.792 --> 22:07.709
(music ends)
