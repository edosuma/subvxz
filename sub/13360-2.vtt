You're late,
and your breath stinks
of wine.

02:37.945 --> 02:39.745
I may have stopped
by the tavern

02:39.779 --> 02:43.145
for one small glass to fortify
myself against the night air.

02:43.179 --> 02:45.012
How goes things here?
Is all well?

02:45.045 --> 02:48.879
No. All is not well.
I nearly died
of boredom, twice.

02:48.912 --> 02:51.179
Finding boredom in one's work
is to be relished.

02:51.212 --> 02:54.112
It means you are being
paid for doing nothing.
What could be better?

02:54.145 --> 02:57.412
I didn't come to Atlantis
to be an errand boy
for rich merchants.

02:57.445 --> 03:00.119
Tomorrow, the frankincense
will be shipped to Helios

03:00.152 --> 03:02.819
and our work guarding it
will be done.

03:02.852 --> 03:06.219
You won't be so sour-faced
when you have gold
in your purse,

03:06.252 --> 03:10.319
a flagon of wine in one hand,
and a beautiful woman
in the other.

03:10.352 --> 03:13.119

three hands, my friend!

04:00.225 --> 04:01.592
That I cannot give.

04:03.025 --> 04:06.192
The man who was cursed
to become the Minotaur.

04:06.225 --> 04:10.292
He told me that I have
a great destiny.
What did he mean?

04:12.192 --> 04:14.059
The images I see are fleeting.

04:14.092 --> 04:16.725
They can be interpreted
in many ways.

04:16.759 --> 04:19.592
Well, then how am I
supposed to understand them?

04:19.625 --> 04:22.492
You tell me that I was brought
to Atlantis for a reason,

04:22.525 --> 04:24.759
but you cannot tell me
what it is?

04:24.792 --> 04:29.792
You tell me
that my father is dead,
but not how or when he died.

04:30.959 --> 04:32.658
You say that
all will become clear,

04:32.692 --> 04:34.258
but what am I supposed to do
until then?

04:34.292 --> 04:37.192
I don't understand
my place in this world!

04:45.759 --> 04:47.492
I don't belong here.

04:47.525 --> 04:52.159
But we have waited so many
years for your return.

04:52.192 --> 04:54.092
What do you want from me?

04:54.125 --> 04:56.192
It is not a question
of what I want.

04:56.225 --> 05:00.765
Your destiny is already
unfolding before you.

05:02.132 --> 05:04.932
How can that be
when I feel so lost?

05:04.965 --> 05:10.432
It is only when we accept
that we are lost that we find
our true path.

05:13.299 --> 05:15.132
I wish I could make it easier.

05:17.432 --> 05:19.432
I will do all I can
to help you.

05:23.232 --> 05:26.299
Why do I sense that you're not
telling me the whole truth?

05:28.665 --> 05:30.565
Because, above anything,

05:30.599 --> 05:34.232
I must protect you from those
who would do you harm.

05:35.232 --> 05:37.165
You must trust in yourself.

05:37.932 --> 05:41.532
With time,
all will become clear.

06:43.972 --> 06:46.505
For the life of me,
I cannot understand
how it happened.

06:46.539 --> 06:50.239
One minute,
the frankincense was there.
The next, it was gone.

06:50.272 --> 06:53.072
You got drunk and fell asleep,
didn't you?

06:53.105 --> 06:54.739
I'm surprised
at you, Pythagoras!

06:54.772 --> 06:57.605
What would lead you
to make such
an outrageous accusation?

06:57.639 --> 07:00.145
The wine stain on your shirt
for a start.

07:00.179 --> 07:02.979
And what is that
on your cheek?

07:03.012 --> 07:04.779
It's dried goat's saliva.

07:04.812 --> 07:09.545
Oh, you will kiss anything
once you've had a few drinks.

07:09.579 --> 07:11.112
I wasn't kissing a goat.

07:12.445 --> 07:14.545
I wasn't.

07:14.579 --> 07:17.545
We can all stand round here,
debating whose fault
this is...

07:17.579 --> 07:19.679
There's no debate.
It's your fault.

07:19.712 --> 07:21.979
A-ha. But is it?

07:22.012 --> 07:24.545
-Yes.
-PYTHAGORAS: Completely.

07:24.579 --> 07:26.912
Or perhaps you will try
and blame the goat?

07:26.945 --> 07:29.612
-(KNOCK AT DOOR)
-It's the merchant.

07:39.012 --> 07:40.479

07:40.512 --> 07:43.545

that his frankincense
was stolen.

07:43.579 --> 07:47.145

No good has ever come
from being honest.

07:47.945 --> 07:49.445
(BANGING ON DOOR)

07:51.245 --> 07:54.045
I seek the men
who slew the Minotaur.

07:59.186 --> 08:01.993
I came to Atlantis,
searching for my daughter...

08:02.926 --> 08:04.893
Demetria.

08:04.926 --> 08:07.160
It is many years
since I last saw her.

08:08.221 --> 08:11.621
I discovered
that she'd found work
in the palace kitchens.

08:11.654 --> 08:13.121
I went to the palace.

08:13.154 --> 08:15.554
I was overjoyed at the thought
of seeing her.

08:17.154 --> 08:18.421
What happened?

08:19.354 --> 08:22.354
I was told that my daughter
is missing.

08:22.387 --> 08:24.587
For three days now,
she's not been seen.

08:26.254 --> 08:28.321
No one knows
what has happened to her.

08:30.221 --> 08:34.254
I have heard stories
of your heroism
in defeating the Minotaur.

08:36.254 --> 08:38.787
I was hoping you would find
my daughter for me.

08:38.821 --> 08:41.187
You have undoubtedly
come to the right place.

08:41.221 --> 08:44.221
Our bravery
and skills are unrivalled,

08:44.254 --> 08:46.354
but such skills
do not come cheap.

08:47.821 --> 08:50.054
I am not a rich man.

08:50.087 --> 08:52.087
I will give you
all that I have.

08:54.754 --> 08:56.121
As much as it saddens me,

08:56.154 --> 08:58.654
unfortunately,
on this occasion,
we are unable to help you.

08:58.687 --> 09:01.354
I know that I'm not long
for this world.

09:01.387 --> 09:04.327
More than anything
I hope that I will die knowing

09:04.361 --> 09:08.161
that my daughter is safe,
and happy, and loved.

09:10.027 --> 09:12.094
It is my duty as her father.

09:12.127 --> 09:13.961
If I fail her...

09:14.927 --> 09:16.561
I will take it to my grave.

09:20.061 --> 09:23.261
We will do everything we can
to help you find
your daughter.

09:37.361 --> 09:38.627
Stay close.

09:41.694 --> 09:42.994
We must hurry.

09:56.627 --> 10:00.127
Korinna? What are you doing?

10:00.161 --> 10:03.434
-Forgive me, my Lady.
-That doesn't answer
my question.

10:03.467 --> 10:04.701
I'm to blame.

10:05.701 --> 10:07.501
A young serving girl
is missing

10:07.534 --> 10:10.201
and I promised her father
I would find out
what had happened to her.

10:10.234 --> 10:12.067
It is forbidden for you
to be here.

10:14.934 --> 10:16.701
You must go
before someone sees you.

10:20.167 --> 10:21.634
I hope you find her.

10:23.634 --> 10:24.901
Thank you.

10:36.467 --> 10:38.134
This is Celandine.

10:38.167 --> 10:41.434
She was the last person
to see Demetria
before she disappeared.

10:41.467 --> 10:43.367
JASON: What more
can you tell me?

10:43.401 --> 10:46.134
Demetria was sent
to the forest to gather herbs.

10:46.167 --> 10:48.067
That is the last
anyone saw of her.

10:49.567 --> 10:51.467
Did anyone search for her?

10:51.501 --> 10:52.934
We are servants.

10:52.967 --> 10:55.401
Our lives are of little value.

10:55.434 --> 10:57.234
Can you take me
to where Demetria

10:57.267 --> 10:59.601
would have gone
to gather these herbs?

10:59.634 --> 11:01.141
I cannot neglect my duties.

11:03.041 --> 11:06.374
I will ensure Princess Ariadne
hears of your kindness.

11:09.774 --> 11:14.141
I will meet you
by the South Gate
when I'm finished here.

11:14.174 --> 11:16.807
Her father
will be most grateful
for your trouble.

11:16.841 --> 11:18.007
As am I.

11:31.974 --> 11:34.374
KARPOS: Hercules, Hercules!

11:34.407 --> 11:36.541
-What are you doing?
-It's Karpos, the merchant.

11:36.574 --> 11:38.807
-Open up!
-What are we going to do?

11:38.841 --> 11:42.607
We will take
the only sensible course
of action available to us.

11:42.641 --> 11:44.807
I demand you let me in!

11:44.841 --> 11:46.907
Hercules! Come here.

11:46.941 --> 11:48.441
KARPOS: Hercules!

11:50.307 --> 11:53.441
Would Demetria really have
come so far to fetch herbs?

11:53.474 --> 11:57.474
Our King does not care
how far his servants walk
to fetch herbs,

11:57.507 --> 11:59.507
so long as they are fetched.

12:14.281 --> 12:15.781
How much further is it?

12:19.181 --> 12:21.281
We're here.

12:21.314 --> 12:24.581
These woods
are rich with herbs...
If you know where to look.

12:41.214 --> 12:43.047
Is this what happened
to Demetria?

12:43.914 --> 12:45.381
Did she die at your hand?

13:12.954 --> 13:15.654
Where's Demetria?
What have you done with her?

13:15.687 --> 13:18.121
She has not been harmed.

13:18.154 --> 13:21.087
Her God will comfort
and provide for her.

13:21.121 --> 13:22.187

14:06.161 --> 14:07.727

killed her in moments.

14:07.761 --> 14:09.861
Why would she take
her own life?

14:09.894 --> 14:11.261
This engraving...

14:12.261 --> 14:14.127
It's a thyrsus.

14:14.161 --> 14:15.727
What's a thyrsus?

14:15.761 --> 14:17.727
A fennel staff,
tipped with a pine cone.

14:17.761 --> 14:19.661
Is there no limit
to your ignorance?

14:19.694 --> 14:22.761
The thyrsus is the symbol
of the God, Dionysus.

14:22.794 --> 14:24.894
The cook must have been
a maenad.

14:24.927 --> 14:28.127
She would rather die
than reveal their secrets
to you.

14:28.161 --> 14:31.294
-Who are these maenads?
-They're the female followers
of Dionysus.

14:31.327 --> 14:35.294
They have a temple
high in the mountains,
in the forest of Nysa.

14:36.727 --> 14:38.527
It is said to be
a magical realm.

14:38.561 --> 14:42.627
Any man who sets foot there
is killed by their satyrs.

14:42.661 --> 14:45.661
-Satyrs?
-The servants of Dionysus.

14:45.694 --> 14:48.161
It's said they feed
on human flesh.

14:48.194 --> 14:50.427
But what would these maenads
want with Demetria?

14:50.461 --> 14:53.927
They take young girls
to initiate into the ways
of their cult.

14:53.961 --> 14:57.994
If the maenads have Demetria,
then they will be holding her
in their temple.

14:58.027 --> 15:01.234
And that is a place
no man should wish to go.

18:47.022 --> 18:50.922
You are blinded
by a foolish sense of duty.

18:50.955 --> 18:54.955
But you are blessed to have
such an honourable friend,

18:54.988 --> 18:59.388
because I have decided,
against my better judgment,
to accompany you.

18:59.422 --> 19:01.822
So, perhaps we should leave
by the North Gate?

If we return to Atlantis.

19:16.062 --> 19:20.262
So, your cunning plan
to avoid paying your debts
is to get yourself killed?

19:22.328 --> 19:26.395
That's it. I'm a genius.
We fake our own deaths.

19:26.428 --> 19:29.295
You cannot collect a debt
from a dead man.

19:29.328 --> 19:32.395
We could change our names,
grow beards...

19:32.428 --> 19:34.595

I can even grow a beard!

20:14.335 --> 20:16.668
I heard that they have talons
for fingers.

20:16.702 --> 20:20.568
-And eyes as black
as the night.
-And that they bathe in blood.

20:20.602 --> 20:23.435
And devour the organs
of those they've slain.

20:23.468 --> 20:26.535
And I heard that they can draw
milk and honey from streams.

20:26.568 --> 20:28.902

I was keeping watch

from the forest.

25:34.226 --> 25:36.692

-Who?

25:37.826 --> 25:40.626
A beautiful girl,
through the trees.

25:40.659 --> 25:42.859
I called to her, but she fled.

25:44.192 --> 25:45.726
I chased after her.

25:45.759 --> 25:48.426
She ran like a gazelle.

It was all I could do to keep
up with her.

25:51.026 --> 25:52.826
I ran, and ran.

25:52.859 --> 25:58.092
And then I found her,
standing in a clearing,
bathed in moonlight.

25:58.126 --> 26:00.159
She was clearly terrified.

26:00.192 --> 26:02.959
I'm not surprised if you were
chasing her through the woods.

26:17.532 --> 26:19.132

26:19.166 --> 26:22.166
Because then
I was surrounded by maenads.

26:22.199 --> 26:25.666
They were to make
an offering of me.
But I was too fast for them.

26:25.699 --> 26:29.866
-Really?
-Yes, really.
I ran for my life.

26:29.899 --> 26:33.299
I was nearly caught again,
but she saved me.

26:33.332 --> 26:36.766
Who? The girl?
I thought you said
that she was a satyr?

26:36.799 --> 26:38.366
She was.
This was another girl.

26:38.399 --> 26:43.332
A woman, a vision of beauty,
the like of which
I have never seen.

26:44.199 --> 26:45.466

38:02.127 --> 38:03.127
(GROANS)

38:03.960 --> 38:05.160
(CHOKES)

38:06.327 --> 38:09.967
(SPEAKS IN ALIEN LANGUAGE)

38:18.267 --> 38:19.667
What did she say?

38:20.433 --> 38:21.767
I don't know.

38:23.300 --> 38:24.900
I think she cursed you.

38:44.467 --> 38:45.867
You have returned?

38:47.067 --> 38:49.167
Demetria... She is with you?

38:49.200 --> 38:50.567
No.

38:51.967 --> 38:53.533
You have found her?

38:56.867 --> 38:58.400
Where is she?

39:00.000 --> 39:01.300
Your daughter...

39:01.333 --> 39:03.067
Your daughter is in Helios.

39:04.367 --> 39:08.307
You know Demetria?
You know her?

39:08.340 --> 39:13.340
I was held captive with her
until Jason and his friends
rescued us.

39:13.373 --> 39:17.040
Demetria has gone to Helios
to be with a boy.

39:17.073 --> 39:20.807
She wanted more than anything
to return to Atlantis...

39:20.840 --> 39:22.673
To be with you.

39:22.707 --> 39:25.640
But she has a new life
in Helios.

39:26.707 --> 39:28.573
She is happy?

39:29.273 --> 39:30.773
She is in love.

39:33.540 --> 39:37.107
Then I will find peace
in the afterlife.

39:43.240 --> 39:45.440
I am deeply indebted to you.

39:46.440 --> 39:48.307
You owe me nothing.

39:50.540 --> 39:52.673
All that I have
in this world...

39:55.373 --> 39:56.640
Is yours.

40:07.107 --> 40:10.680
Demetria asked me to care
for you in her place.

40:26.547 --> 40:29.947
JASON: You told me
the path I choose to follow
would become clear.

40:29.980 --> 40:32.061
Now, I'm more confused
than ever.

40:32.928 --> 40:35.261
I was unable to save Demetria.

40:37.528 --> 40:39.894
I failed.

40:39.928 --> 40:44.394
You believed that the path
you were following
would lead to one girl,

40:44.428 --> 40:46.028
and yet you found another.

40:47.528 --> 40:49.828
Perhaps that was
your true purpose.

40:52.394 --> 40:54.194
From my time
in the other world,

40:54.228 --> 40:56.828
there were stories
of someone named Medusa.

40:56.861 --> 40:59.794
What is to become of her?

40:59.828 --> 41:03.194
I believe you already know
the answer to that question.

41:04.761 --> 41:06.328
She has done no wrong.

41:07.801 --> 41:09.368
I will not see her harmed.

41:09.401 --> 41:13.768
Medusa can no more escape
her destiny than you can
escape yours.

41:15.168 --> 41:19.501
Her fate is inextricably
bound to your own.

41:19.534 --> 41:21.534
I don't understand.

41:21.568 --> 41:23.876
Why is my destiny
so important?

41:23.909 --> 41:27.876
Because the fate
of all of Atlantis
rests in your hands.

41:27.909 --> 41:30.543
Why? Why me?

41:33.043 --> 41:36.709
For the same reason that
the satyrs did not attack you.

41:43.143 --> 41:44.709
You're not like other men.

41:46.976 --> 41:49.543
You will realize that
soon enough.

42:09.816 --> 42:12.283
It is Poseidon
you have wronged,

42:12.316 --> 42:15.416
as such, you have been
called before the bulls.
