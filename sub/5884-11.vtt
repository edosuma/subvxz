01:08.808 --> 01:10.876
I have sand in the weirdest places.

01:10.943 --> 01:13.912
Jones beach? Don't be so sure it's sand.

01:13.980 --> 01:16.448
<i>- ( Radio playing )
- Hold up.</i>

01:16.516 --> 01:18.984
We got hitchers.

01:19.052 --> 01:20.819
<i>- Made it.
- I see that.</i>

01:22.422 --> 01:24.322
Hey.

01:24.390 --> 01:26.258
Hi.

01:29.529 --> 01:30.962
Girls, on the hop.

01:35.568 --> 01:37.235
You gotta get up.

01:39.639 --> 01:41.640
All I want to say is I did not plan this.

01:41.708 --> 01:43.842
Nobody talk. I'm really stoned.

01:47.046 --> 01:48.880
I'm sorry.

01:48.948 --> 01:50.215
You're like a pound or less.

01:52.885 --> 01:54.820
<i>( Door closes )</i>

01:54.887 --> 01:56.688
<i>( Engine struggling )</i>

02:00.126 --> 02:02.127
I see you went in.

02:02.195 --> 02:04.262
I like the water.

02:04.330 --> 02:05.797
<i>- Can I quote you on that?
- ( Engine starts )</i>

02:06.966 --> 02:08.600
I'm learning.

02:14.741 --> 02:16.575
- Oh my God. You're a slob.
- Shh!

02:16.642 --> 02:18.510
( Softly ) We have to be quiet.
I have a roommate.

02:22.381 --> 02:24.182
( Kissing )

02:37.063 --> 02:39.030
God, I love your shoulders.

02:39.098 --> 02:41.399
You look like you're in the Olympics.

02:42.535 --> 02:44.035
You never stop talking.

02:47.874 --> 02:49.941
It was like the movies.
One minute we're listening

02:50.009 --> 02:51.643
to a lecture on rhododendrons,

02:51.711 --> 02:53.345
the next, Patricia is driving

02:53.412 --> 02:55.013
like a speed racer to the hospital.

02:55.081 --> 02:57.048
And Trudy keeps apologizing
in the back seat.

02:57.116 --> 02:59.017
We're saying, "it's okay. Nobody cares.

02:59.085 --> 03:01.753
- You're having a baby!"
- ( Chuckles )

03:01.821 --> 03:03.755
Meanwhile, Campbell's on the back nine

03:03.823 --> 03:05.490
with his father-in-law,
who's also a client.

03:05.558 --> 03:08.059
Well, that's a nice way to end a round.

03:08.127 --> 03:10.362
Ken Cosgrove. Don't get up.

03:10.429 --> 03:12.430
John Flory.

03:12.498 --> 03:13.965
This is my fiancée Cynthia,

03:14.033 --> 03:15.700
her parents, Ed and Lillian Baxter.

03:15.768 --> 03:17.102
- Sorry to interrupt.
- It's a pleasure.

03:17.170 --> 03:19.070
- Nice to meet you.
- Aren't you lucky?

03:19.138 --> 03:20.972
I'm spending my Sunday night with Dodge.

03:21.040 --> 03:23.809
Nice to see you, Ken.
And I'm sorry about, you know.

03:23.876 --> 03:26.845
- My condolences.
- Oh, David Montgomery?

03:26.913 --> 03:29.314
I was only there for about six months.
I didn't really know him.

03:29.382 --> 03:31.716
Oh. Right.

03:31.784 --> 03:34.252
Well, I should be on my way.

03:34.320 --> 03:35.353
- It was nice meeting you all.
- Ed: Mmn.

03:38.758 --> 03:41.193
Flory.

03:42.495 --> 03:44.262
Look, you're with your family.

03:44.330 --> 03:46.064
- I shouldn't have said anything.
- You didn't.

03:46.132 --> 03:47.833
What's going on?

03:47.900 --> 03:49.601
Lucky Strike.

03:49.669 --> 03:51.203
They're coming over to us.

03:51.270 --> 03:52.938
What?

03:53.005 --> 03:54.472
Look, you didn't hear it from me, okay?

03:54.540 --> 03:56.741
( Snorts )
You're winding me up.

03:56.809 --> 03:58.643
No. American Tobacco came in last Monday,

03:58.711 --> 04:00.245
said they're moving all the brands to us.

04:00.313 --> 04:03.081
Well, that's not true.

04:03.149 --> 04:05.483
Someone should tell Lee Garner Jr. that.

04:05.551 --> 04:07.552
Sorry.

04:17.396 --> 04:19.397
<i>Ed: You okay, son?</i>

04:19.464 --> 04:22.132
Whenever ad men meet, all they
ever do is brag and brag.

04:22.201 --> 04:24.302
It's hard not to get rattled.

04:26.072 --> 04:28.240
Ed, Lillian, you'll have to excuse me.

04:28.307 --> 04:30.775
Sweetheart, I swear to
you I wouldn't do this

04:30.843 --> 04:32.077
if it wasn't serious.

04:37.516 --> 04:40.018
Ken! What a pleasant surprise!

04:40.086 --> 04:42.287
There's nothing much to celebrate yet.

04:42.355 --> 04:45.056
They were going to send Trudy
home, but her mother protested.

04:45.124 --> 04:47.058
I sent her for food just to get rid of her.

04:47.126 --> 04:50.362
Anyway, I suppose your visit is premature.

04:50.429 --> 04:52.597
- I shouldn't use that word around here.
- Can I talk to you?

04:55.001 --> 04:57.636
John Flory, some prick over at B.B.D.O.,

04:57.703 --> 04:59.537
just told me that Lucky Strike
is going there.

05:00.706 --> 05:02.240
What?

05:02.308 --> 05:05.443
<i>- ( Phone ringing )
- You made me wait for you</i>

05:05.511 --> 05:06.878
while you worked.
( Kissing )

05:06.946 --> 05:09.381
I'm not waiting anymore.

05:09.448 --> 05:11.049
I should get it.

05:13.119 --> 05:14.286
Faye: Of course. The kids.

05:16.889 --> 05:18.223
- Hello?
- It's Pete.

05:18.291 --> 05:20.292
Have you heard anything
about Lucky Strike leaving?

05:20.359 --> 05:23.194
- No.
- Ken heard from somebody at B.B.D.O

05:23.262 --> 05:26.364
- that Lucky's coming over.
- Bullshit. Call Roger.

05:26.432 --> 05:28.033
<i>I did. He's out.</i>

05:28.100 --> 05:30.001
Wake Cooper. Meet me in the office.

05:31.570 --> 05:33.772
- What happened?
- I'm not sure.

05:35.107 --> 05:36.708
I have to make a call.

05:38.911 --> 05:40.779
<i>Roger: Hello?</i>

05:43.149 --> 05:45.083
- What's going on?
- Pete: Ken here

05:45.151 --> 05:46.718
heard that Lucky Strike is leaving.

05:46.786 --> 05:48.853
- That they've already left.
- What?

05:48.921 --> 05:51.723
- Who told you what?
- John Flory.

05:51.791 --> 05:54.125
He's an account executive at B.B.D.O.
That's where they're going.

05:54.193 --> 05:57.128
- No. That's impossible.
- Call him.

05:57.196 --> 05:58.897
I'm telling you it's impossible.

06:03.703 --> 06:05.503
Don't lose your temper.

06:07.406 --> 06:08.873
Somebody call Lane in London?

06:08.941 --> 06:10.842
Yeah, I don't think he'll go back to sleep.

06:10.910 --> 06:13.111
Could I get a drink?

06:19.418 --> 06:21.019
It's ringing.

06:22.388 --> 06:24.022
Lee. Roger Sterling.

06:24.090 --> 06:26.858
From your agency?

06:26.926 --> 06:29.160
Well, it's serious.

06:30.730 --> 06:32.397
He's drunk.

06:34.033 --> 06:35.400
You're damn right I heard.

06:37.470 --> 06:40.038
<i>Because you can consolidate
your business here.</i>

06:42.441 --> 06:44.275
<i>Just because your father's
non compos mentis</i>

06:44.343 --> 06:45.977
doesn't mean you have
to listen to the board.

06:47.480 --> 06:49.481
It's bullshit! Lee!

06:49.548 --> 06:51.549
30 years?!

06:51.617 --> 06:53.718
I have to hear it on the street?

06:53.786 --> 06:55.954
No review? Nothing?!

07:03.195 --> 07:05.163
He hung up.

07:06.999 --> 07:08.700
It's true?

07:20.613 --> 07:23.548
Tomorrow morning we're getting
on the 6:00 a.m. to Raleigh-Durham.

07:23.616 --> 07:25.617
I'll do it.

07:25.684 --> 07:27.452
I've known him half my life.

07:27.520 --> 07:29.354
I need a drink.

07:39.098 --> 07:40.532
<i>( Keys jingle, door opens, closes )</i>

07:41.734 --> 07:43.735
<i>( Keys clatter )</i>

07:43.803 --> 07:47.072
- What time is it?
- Midnight.

07:49.075 --> 07:50.809
You want one?

07:52.645 --> 07:54.612
Looks like you need both.

08:02.054 --> 08:04.122
It looks like Lucky Strike
might have gone south.

08:05.658 --> 08:07.392
Holy crap.

08:07.460 --> 08:10.028
Obviously we'd like to avoid
that information getting out.

08:11.630 --> 08:13.231
What happened?

08:13.299 --> 08:15.700
Supposedly, they're consolidating

08:15.768 --> 08:18.636
for a reduced commission at B.B.D.O.

08:20.940 --> 08:24.209
Hey, watch it.
You have to keep a clear head.

08:24.276 --> 08:26.044
( Bottle thuds )

08:27.780 --> 08:30.248
( Sighs ) Every day, I tried not
to think about what would happen

08:30.316 --> 08:31.850
if this happened.

08:39.758 --> 08:41.592
Aw, look at that plum.

08:45.030 --> 08:47.565
- What's that?
- That face.

08:51.203 --> 08:53.338
You're the most hirable man
on Madison Avenue.

08:53.405 --> 08:55.106
I'm not at that point yet.

08:57.176 --> 08:58.610
Okay.

09:14.827 --> 09:16.694
( Tv playing )

09:18.864 --> 09:21.633
- Where's Trudy?
- Her mother's got her all worked up.

09:21.700 --> 09:24.502
She made such a stink.
And that thing's at least another day away.

09:24.570 --> 09:26.504
Can I see her?

09:26.572 --> 09:28.206
Have you been drinking?

09:30.009 --> 09:31.376
You need to calm down.

09:31.443 --> 09:33.511
I was at a ballgame when Trudy was born.

09:33.579 --> 09:35.713
Go about your business.

09:38.784 --> 09:40.018
( Sighs )

09:42.488 --> 09:43.821
Are you all right?

09:48.627 --> 09:50.128
Could I speak with you candidly?

09:50.196 --> 09:52.330
Always. I'd like to think

09:52.398 --> 09:54.432
I'm more to you than
a typical father-in-law.

09:54.500 --> 09:57.235
You are. That's the problem.
It's about business.

09:58.904 --> 10:00.772
There's no business in here, son.

10:02.875 --> 10:06.110
We may have lost Lucky Strike.

10:06.178 --> 10:08.379
I'm sure this agency was a thrill,

10:08.447 --> 10:09.614
but you've had your folly.

10:09.682 --> 10:12.350
That's not right, Tom.

10:12.418 --> 10:15.153
I haven't stayed at Vick Chemical
for 28 years because I love it.

10:15.221 --> 10:18.690
It's because I have a family.
Any minute here, you will too.

10:18.757 --> 10:21.893
- This still can work.
- I'm not rooting against you.

10:21.961 --> 10:24.195
You've got my account, for God's sake.

10:24.263 --> 10:26.464
It's just...

10:26.532 --> 10:29.567
You're a frequent topic at C.G.C.

10:30.836 --> 10:32.904
Apparently you were a tough act to follow

10:32.972 --> 10:35.473
- when we moved Clearasil over there.
- Ted Chaough?

10:35.541 --> 10:38.009
- I hate him.
- He's a good guy.

10:38.077 --> 10:41.679
He's not interested in me.
He's just trying to hobble Don.

10:41.747 --> 10:44.749
There's no reward
in going down with the ship.

10:44.817 --> 10:47.919
I have an agency. I'm a partner.

10:49.321 --> 10:50.855
I found him.

10:50.923 --> 10:53.625
He was down at the candy
machines dozed off.

10:53.692 --> 10:54.826
<i>- Can I see her?
- No.</i>

10:54.893 --> 10:56.894
She finally went to sleep.

10:56.962 --> 10:58.630
Why don't you just go back

10:58.697 --> 11:00.265
to the candy machines and we'll wait?

11:00.332 --> 11:02.033
I'm sorry about that.

11:09.608 --> 11:13.211
The air conditioning guy's
supposed to be there at 8:00.

11:16.215 --> 11:17.949
I guess I'll see you then.

11:20.786 --> 11:22.620
You don't want me to go?

11:24.423 --> 11:27.525
I want you to do whatever you usually do.

11:27.593 --> 11:30.528
<i>Hey, I don't usually do anything.</i>

11:32.798 --> 11:36.367
- Really?
- Can't you tell by how badly I'm leaving?

11:39.638 --> 11:41.239
I'm not letting you leave.

11:51.717 --> 11:53.618
What about your air?

11:59.958 --> 12:02.026
You're unbelievable.

12:02.094 --> 12:04.862
I'm sorry. I'm not usually like this.

12:12.404 --> 12:14.138
( Rings )

12:14.206 --> 12:18.142
- Hello?
- I just walked out of there.

12:18.210 --> 12:19.744
It's over.

12:22.014 --> 12:23.981
<i>- I see.
- Since his father got sick,</i>

12:24.049 --> 12:26.351
<i>the board took over.
There's no point in talking to them.</i>

12:26.418 --> 12:28.486
<i>He said we did good work.</i>

12:28.554 --> 12:30.588
Our clients need to hear this from us.

12:30.656 --> 12:32.957
I know, Bert. Don't wait for me.

12:33.025 --> 12:36.761
I'm standing by Lee's receptionist.

12:36.829 --> 12:38.996
I didn't want to have to pay
for the long-distance call.

12:39.064 --> 12:41.366
Very well then.

12:52.264 --> 12:53.998
<i>( Staff chatting )</i>

12:59.805 --> 13:01.539
Lane Pryce isn't coming back.

13:01.607 --> 13:03.541
That's my guess.

13:03.609 --> 13:05.576
I think they'd do that in a memo.

13:05.644 --> 13:07.979
I got $5 that says Cooper's retiring.

13:08.046 --> 13:10.047
No champagne?

13:10.115 --> 13:12.149
I'd say he's got cancer.

13:12.217 --> 13:14.051
It's in bigger print now.

13:14.119 --> 13:16.954
Everyone? If we could have
your attention, please?

13:19.524 --> 13:21.225
<i>- Bert.
- Ahem.</i>

13:23.161 --> 13:26.530
"We have called this meeting
of our nearest and dearest"

13:26.598 --> 13:31.135
to let you know of a change in the agency.

13:31.203 --> 13:33.771
After 30 years of consummate service,

13:33.839 --> 13:37.275
American Tobacco hasreluctantly decided

13:37.342 --> 13:39.710
to consolidate their business

13:39.778 --> 13:43.080
"at Batten, Barton, Durstine & Osborn."

13:44.249 --> 13:45.983
Damn it.

13:46.051 --> 13:50.054
"So what does this mean to you?

13:50.122 --> 13:55.159
Now Donald Draper:
partner, creative director."

13:58.063 --> 13:59.664
Pete Campbell and Ken Cosgrove

13:59.731 --> 14:01.332
will handle calls to clients.

14:01.400 --> 14:03.768
Those are the only calls
we want made with this news.

14:05.170 --> 14:07.405
Now we've had a pretty good year.

14:07.472 --> 14:09.473
We've gained more accounts

14:09.541 --> 14:10.942
than we've lost, a lot more,

14:11.009 --> 14:13.878
because our work is
thoughtful and effective...

14:13.946 --> 14:16.013
Even Lucky Strike said so...

14:16.081 --> 14:18.182
Which means that nothing should change.

14:18.250 --> 14:20.384
Nothing will change.

14:20.452 --> 14:22.453
We're gonna push ourselves
shoulder to shoulder

14:22.521 --> 14:24.755
and we're gonna overcome this
and succeed tenfold

14:24.823 --> 14:26.624
and it will be exhilarating.

14:26.692 --> 14:28.893
( Staff murmuring )

14:28.961 --> 14:30.828
Joe?

14:32.564 --> 14:36.434
As Don said, nothing is going to change.

14:36.501 --> 14:39.870
<i>( Faintly ) There's only a
small modification in policy.</i>

14:39.938 --> 14:41.872
<i>Anything out of the ordinary</i>

14:41.940 --> 14:46.243
<i>must be approved by myself,
Joan Harris or Lane Pryce.</i>

14:46.311 --> 14:48.045
<i>That said,</i>

14:48.113 --> 14:52.283
inquiries as to paychecks and advances...

14:52.351 --> 14:55.186
- What's going on?
- That's the head of accounting.

14:55.253 --> 14:56.954
What do you think's going on?

14:57.022 --> 14:58.356
<i>Joe: Any questions?</i>

15:01.126 --> 15:03.060
Nothing?

15:03.128 --> 15:05.629
Okay. If you want
to talk to me individually,

15:05.697 --> 15:07.999
- I'll be in my office.
- ( Staff murmuring )

15:10.202 --> 15:12.937
- What happened?
- We lost Lucky Strike.

15:13.005 --> 15:15.239
Jesus.

15:15.307 --> 15:18.042
But it sounds like
everything's under control.

15:18.110 --> 15:20.044
I've got to go to a meeting.

15:20.112 --> 15:23.314
Peggy, Freddy, Danny, Stan...
In my office.

15:30.722 --> 15:32.189
We're in some trouble here.

15:32.257 --> 15:34.358
Creative needs to be on its toes.

15:34.426 --> 15:37.094
Is it a "last hired, last fired"
sort of thing?

15:38.697 --> 15:40.698
You're in this room. That's all I can say.

15:40.766 --> 15:42.767
Now myself and the other partners

15:42.834 --> 15:45.002
will be out there beating the
bushes for new business,

15:45.070 --> 15:47.671
but creative's job is to
hold on to what we have.

15:47.739 --> 15:51.242
That means client's ideas should
seem better than they normally do.

15:51.309 --> 15:53.744
For the next few weeks
the only words you know

15:53.812 --> 15:55.846
- are "yes, sir."
- Yes, sir.

15:55.914 --> 15:58.516
That means, Stan, you babysit
that Samsonite shoot every day.

15:58.583 --> 16:01.052
Peggy, the Playtex presentation
is still set for tomorrow.

16:01.119 --> 16:02.820
I'll bring in my notes.
I can prep you in 10 minutes.

16:02.888 --> 16:04.455
No. You're still gonna do it.

16:04.523 --> 16:06.457
It'll look desperate
if I'm suddenly involved.

16:06.525 --> 16:09.660
- So what about it then?
- Be successful.

16:09.728 --> 16:11.662
I'm not worried.

16:11.730 --> 16:13.731
Okay. Let's skip the gossip out there.

16:13.799 --> 16:15.666
Get to work.

16:18.403 --> 16:20.738
Peggy?

16:20.806 --> 16:22.540
( Flatly ) You're not worried?

16:22.607 --> 16:25.309
I don't know.
You seem to have everything in hand.

16:27.012 --> 16:28.379
Should I be worried?

16:28.447 --> 16:30.614
We don't even know
how bad this is gonna be

16:30.682 --> 16:32.516
until Lane shows up.

16:32.584 --> 16:34.985
Every time something good happens,

16:35.053 --> 16:37.988
something bad happens.
I knew I'd pay for it.

16:38.056 --> 16:39.990
You're not paying for anything.

16:40.058 --> 16:41.926
But I'm counting on you.

16:44.996 --> 16:46.831
<i>Close that, will you?</i>

17:00.979 --> 17:03.380
<i>( Phone rings )</i>

17:05.383 --> 17:08.051
- Joan Harris.
- Joanie, I'm glad you're there.

17:08.119 --> 17:10.988
I'm so sorry.

17:11.056 --> 17:13.290
I feel so guilty.

17:13.358 --> 17:15.358
It's not your fault.

17:15.426 --> 17:17.461
I need to see you.

17:17.529 --> 17:18.996
I need you to come down here.

17:19.064 --> 17:20.763
I'm not flying to Raleigh.

17:20.832 --> 17:24.602
- When do you get back?
- No, I'm here.

17:24.669 --> 17:26.303
What are you talking about?

17:26.371 --> 17:28.105
Mr. Cooper said he spoke with you.

17:28.173 --> 17:31.642
He did, but I didn't go.

17:31.710 --> 17:34.111
Damn it, Roger. Get on a plane.

17:34.179 --> 17:36.780
You're very persuasive in person.

17:36.848 --> 17:38.849
There's no point.

17:38.917 --> 17:41.352
It's been over for weeks. Garner
was supposed to give me a month.

17:41.419 --> 17:42.753
The bastard couldn't keep to it.

17:42.821 --> 17:44.788
<i>You knew about it?!</i>

17:44.856 --> 17:47.391
I can't believe you.
We could've done something.

17:47.459 --> 17:49.994
Don't yell at me.
You know what it's been like

17:50.061 --> 17:52.229
walking around with this?
I got a hole in my gut.

17:52.297 --> 17:56.066
What am I supposed to do
with this information?

17:56.134 --> 17:57.735
I'm sorry.

17:57.802 --> 18:00.037
But I need you to know
why I need you to see you.

18:00.105 --> 18:01.906
You should've told me.

18:01.973 --> 18:04.074
Why didn't you tell me?

18:04.142 --> 18:06.677
I kept meaning to say something.

18:06.745 --> 18:08.879
I thought I still had time.
I don't know.

18:10.415 --> 18:13.250
I should go. There's a lot of work to do.

18:13.318 --> 18:15.152
Come after work.

18:15.220 --> 18:16.954
I'm at the Statler.

18:17.022 --> 18:19.290
I had to stay away from Midtown.

18:19.357 --> 18:21.258
I'll have to see.

18:30.402 --> 18:32.102
I think my setup is good,

18:32.170 --> 18:35.105
but Don always has these
little examples at the end

18:35.173 --> 18:38.475
<i>that explain to the client
how big the idea is.</i>

18:38.543 --> 18:41.212
They're always kind of poetic.

18:41.279 --> 18:43.747
So get Don to write it. We can't lose this.

18:43.815 --> 18:45.816
Since when do we have donuts?

18:45.884 --> 18:48.586
Condemned man always gets
his choice of a last meal.

18:48.653 --> 18:50.788
You know what Pete Campbell
just said to me?

18:50.855 --> 18:52.957
He said if anybody sends
a resume out of here,

18:53.024 --> 18:55.960
- they're gonna get executed.
- Fellas, we're on an account right now.

18:58.897 --> 19:01.465
Playtex gloves protect a woman's hands

19:01.533 --> 19:04.902
so they're soft enough to touch

19:04.970 --> 19:07.338
all the things a woman wants to touch.

19:07.405 --> 19:09.573
All the things?

19:09.641 --> 19:11.976
- ( Snorts softly )
- Uh-huh.

19:12.043 --> 19:14.712
The exciting things she wants to feel

19:14.779 --> 19:17.314
with her fingertips.

19:19.317 --> 19:20.918
His lips.

19:20.986 --> 19:23.621
The tuft of hair on his chest.

19:26.358 --> 19:28.525
The small of his back.

19:29.894 --> 19:31.895
I can't imagine Don saying that.

19:31.963 --> 19:35.199
Excuse me.
I have a delivery for Peggy Olson.

19:37.035 --> 19:39.436
- What?
- Are you Peggy Olson? It's C.O.D.

19:41.940 --> 19:43.607
Let me get my purse.

19:45.910 --> 19:48.479
Go ahead without me. I'm gonna
take care of this and then practice.

19:50.148 --> 19:52.850
Am I wrong or is she giving it off?

19:52.917 --> 19:55.085
Well, it's the last days of Rome.

19:55.153 --> 19:57.121
I was in an agency that went down.

19:57.188 --> 19:58.722
The women get sex-crazed.

20:00.058 --> 20:02.693
The energy is very good.

20:05.748 --> 20:07.249
They said they wanted
to revise the media plan,

20:07.316 --> 20:08.650
but I think what they
really wanted was a budget

20:08.718 --> 20:10.018
to see how much of their money
we haven't spent yet.

20:10.086 --> 20:12.687
- Who are we talking about?
- Birds-eye.

20:12.755 --> 20:14.423
Harry: Why are we worrying
about existing accounts?

20:14.490 --> 20:16.258
If anything, they're going
to get more attention.

20:16.325 --> 20:18.293
Because they're afraid we won't be here.

20:18.361 --> 20:21.129
I have news from London.

20:21.197 --> 20:24.232
Pete, wake up.

20:24.300 --> 20:27.235
Lane thinks our billings are probably
around $22 million without Lucky,

20:27.303 --> 20:28.937
but he has to look at everything in person.

20:29.005 --> 20:30.505
( Yawns ) When's he coming?

20:30.573 --> 20:32.107
As soon as he can.

20:32.175 --> 20:35.310
David Montgomery's memorial
is tomorrow afternoon.

20:35.378 --> 20:36.945
In case we need cheering up?

20:37.013 --> 20:39.114
The man was senior
vice president of accounts

20:39.182 --> 20:41.950
at the #4 agency.

20:42.018 --> 20:44.853
There's gonna be a lot of
vulnerable clients in attendance.

20:44.921 --> 20:47.422
- I think Roger knew him.
- Sorry to interrupt.

20:47.490 --> 20:50.358
- It's Al Weaver from Glo-coat.
- What does he want?

20:50.426 --> 20:52.761
- I don't know.
- Do you want me on the call?

20:52.829 --> 20:55.063
Didn't you talk with him this morning?

20:56.466 --> 20:57.866
No.

21:14.283 --> 21:16.284
<i>- Al, how are you?
- Hello, Don.</i>

21:16.352 --> 21:18.720
<i>I'm glad I could reach you.
I just wanted to let you know</i>

21:18.788 --> 21:21.356
<i>we appreciate everything
you've done for us,</i>

21:21.424 --> 21:24.459
<i>but we've decided to take the
account in a different direction.</i>

21:24.527 --> 21:26.928
<i>- All right, Al...
- I want you to know it wasn't an easy decision.</i>

21:26.996 --> 21:28.797
<i>- Now can I talk?
- Sure.</i>

21:28.865 --> 21:30.932
I don't think you understand
what's happened here.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.801
And I'm not talking about
losing Lucky Strike.

21:32.869 --> 21:35.303
<i>- Lucky Strike didn't enter into it.
- Really?</i>

21:35.371 --> 21:37.205
So that has nothing to do with this?

21:37.273 --> 21:39.474
<i>Don, it's a simple coincidence
that it happened now.</i>

21:39.542 --> 21:42.344
Okay, you're right. It is bad timing.

21:42.411 --> 21:44.112
<i>How can you blame us
for wanting to move on?</i>

21:44.180 --> 21:46.648
Because that commercial,
that little cowboy kid,

21:46.716 --> 21:49.050
was the first successful
strategy you've been near

21:49.118 --> 21:52.053
since you sponsored fibber McGee
and Molly. We won the Clio!

21:52.121 --> 21:53.855
<i>- You won the clio.
- With work we did for you!</i>

21:53.923 --> 21:55.390
With your direction!

21:55.458 --> 21:57.025
<i>Believe me, we know how it looks,</i>

21:57.093 --> 21:58.927
<i>but it's just business, plain and simple.</i>

21:58.995 --> 22:02.163
I'm coming out there.
We're gonna talk about this in person.

22:02.231 --> 22:04.866
<i>I'm sorry, Don. The decision's been made.</i>

22:04.934 --> 22:07.035
<i>I just thought you should hear it from me.</i>

22:07.103 --> 22:09.037
You know we're gonna want
another shot at this soon.

22:09.105 --> 22:10.872
<i>As long as you're around.</i>

22:10.940 --> 22:12.908
We'll be here. Don't worry.

22:12.975 --> 22:14.643
<i>Good luck, Don.</i>

22:14.710 --> 22:16.745
<i>I hope we can work together again sometime.</i>

22:16.812 --> 22:18.713
<i>- Okay.
- Goodbye.</i>

22:18.781 --> 22:19.814
Goodbye.

22:28.491 --> 22:31.092
<i>- ( Loud thud )
- What was that?</i>

22:31.160 --> 22:32.694
Nothing.

22:35.498 --> 22:37.899
- Do you want ice?
- No, but I need a favor.

22:37.967 --> 22:40.168
- Make sure I don't overdo it.
- Okay.

22:40.236 --> 22:43.471
How do I... um, it's hard to tell with you.

22:43.539 --> 22:46.741
Stop me at three.
This is one.

22:52.315 --> 22:54.916
The doctor says they never let
the labor go past two sunsets.

22:54.984 --> 22:56.384
<i>Harry: What exactly is the problem?</i>

22:56.452 --> 22:58.420
Apparently Trudy's pelvis is too small

22:58.487 --> 23:00.288
and the baby's shoulders
can't get through.

23:00.356 --> 23:03.592
- They should cut it out.
- They don't like to start there.

23:03.659 --> 23:06.194
Go to the hospital.
There's nothing to do here.

23:06.262 --> 23:08.730
- It's obviously what matters to you.
- What?

23:08.798 --> 23:10.865
I don't know what the hell you
said to them this morning.

23:16.339 --> 23:19.808
So, Joan, that puts us at what?
20 million and change?

23:19.875 --> 23:21.910
Are you doubting my efforts?

23:21.978 --> 23:23.812
All you had to do was tell
them everything was fine.

23:23.879 --> 23:25.513
You think that call's easy to make?

23:25.581 --> 23:27.382
I think you're distracted.

23:27.450 --> 23:29.017
Because of that, I think you
scared the shit out of 'em.

23:29.085 --> 23:31.052
Who the hell do you think
you're talking to?

23:53.142 --> 23:55.076
Don't blow a gasket.

23:55.144 --> 23:57.879
He called looking for me and my
secretary told him where I was.

23:57.947 --> 23:59.781
Incredible.

24:01.751 --> 24:03.485
<i>( Jeannie laughing )
That was something else.</i>

24:03.552 --> 24:06.855
There he is... The man of the hour.

24:06.922 --> 24:09.224
Ted. How considerate of you to stop by.

24:09.291 --> 24:11.026
I wish the baby was here already,

24:11.093 --> 24:12.594
but I'm sure everyone feels that way.

24:12.662 --> 24:14.663
Good news is always worth waiting for.

24:14.730 --> 24:17.599
Well, Jeannie, remember: Don't let
your vanity get the best of you.

24:17.667 --> 24:19.834
There is nothing wrong
with being called grandma.

24:19.902 --> 24:21.436
Oh.
( Laughs )

24:24.807 --> 24:27.409
It's a rattle. You can get it engraved.

24:27.476 --> 24:29.511
Ogilvy sent me one when my son was born.

24:29.578 --> 24:32.247
Thank you. What do you want, Ted?

24:32.314 --> 24:34.449
No, this is about what you want.

24:34.517 --> 24:36.885
I mean, you're about to have everything

24:36.952 --> 24:39.054
the minute that baby comes.

24:39.121 --> 24:41.156
You know your father-in-law
never stops talking about you?

24:41.223 --> 24:43.024
He doesn't know the half of it.

24:43.092 --> 24:45.627
You've brought in a little business
since you went out on your own...

24:45.695 --> 24:47.696
Glo-coat, Life cereal,

24:47.763 --> 24:49.931
Sugarberry Hams, Vick Chemical obviously,

24:49.999 --> 24:52.367
Mountain dew, Fillmore Auto,
Birds-eye, Ponds?

24:52.435 --> 24:54.502
I didn't do all that by myself.

24:54.570 --> 24:57.639
Pete, as far as I'm concerned,
you're what's missing from C.G.C.

24:59.008 --> 25:00.642
Jim Cutler's due to retire.

25:00.710 --> 25:02.644
"Campbell, Gleason & Chaough"?

25:02.712 --> 25:05.580
Has a nice ring to it.

25:05.648 --> 25:07.949
Wouldn't you want your name first?

25:08.017 --> 25:09.684
I'm open to it if we're
having that discussion.

25:11.253 --> 25:12.887
You'll have a full voting third.

25:12.955 --> 25:14.522
I'm not Don.

25:14.590 --> 25:16.458
It's not the wild west.

25:16.525 --> 25:19.494
We just got Alfa Romeo...
Little Italian sports car.

25:19.562 --> 25:22.163
I don't know if you've heard of it, but I
think you'll really enjoy driving one.

25:22.231 --> 25:24.766
- I don't drive.
- I'll teach you.

25:24.834 --> 25:28.403
Tom, Jeannie, remember
my offer still stands.

25:28.471 --> 25:30.271
<i>If you want a hotel room, I can
get you one across the street.</i>

25:45.955 --> 25:48.456
Roger. I let you come over

25:48.524 --> 25:50.925
because you said you needed to talk.
We can talk.

25:50.993 --> 25:53.128
- Joanie, I need you.
- Stop it,

25:53.195 --> 25:54.929
or we can talk on the phone.

25:58.067 --> 25:59.334
Is that what you sleep in now?

26:01.337 --> 26:04.372
What do you want? I'm exhausted!

26:04.440 --> 26:07.008
I waited for you at the hotel.

26:07.076 --> 26:09.244
- Why didn't you come?
Are you mad at me?
- No.

26:09.311 --> 26:12.147
Roger, I can't do this anymore.

26:12.214 --> 26:14.349
You always say that.

26:14.416 --> 26:17.185
- Then you come back to me because
we belong together.
- Don't do that.

26:18.721 --> 26:20.555
I need you right now.

26:20.623 --> 26:22.690
Because I'm a port in a storm?

26:22.758 --> 26:26.194
No. Because I feel like
shit and you care about me.

26:26.262 --> 26:28.663
I'm not a solution to your problems.

26:28.731 --> 26:31.099
I'm another problem.

26:31.167 --> 26:33.101
Are you serious?

26:33.169 --> 26:35.570
I can't do this anymore.

26:35.638 --> 26:38.273
You'll change your mind.
You'll see.

26:38.340 --> 26:39.674
I'm sorry.

26:41.443 --> 26:43.845
I just can't do this anymore.

26:46.215 --> 26:47.949
So what are you trying to say?

26:48.017 --> 26:49.918
Roger.

27:30.793 --> 27:32.594
So that night we got mugged,

27:32.661 --> 27:34.596
that was the last time?

27:39.268 --> 27:40.702
Wish I'd known that.

27:54.116 --> 27:55.984
<i>( Door closes )</i>

27:58.409 --> 28:00.143
( Buffer whirring )

28:03.614 --> 28:05.948
God, I'd think this place
would be packed still.

28:06.016 --> 28:07.784
It's 8:00.

28:07.851 --> 28:09.819
There's only so much we can
pretend like we're doing.

28:15.693 --> 28:17.260
- Are you okay?
- You want something?

28:19.697 --> 28:21.564
I'd rather eat, but that's me.

28:21.632 --> 28:23.566
I'm one over for the day.

28:27.471 --> 28:28.871
<i>( Whirring stops )</i>

28:28.939 --> 28:30.606
See that?

28:30.674 --> 28:33.042
I kissed you and it got quiet.

28:35.813 --> 28:38.181
- How'd it go?
- It was...

28:40.250 --> 28:41.984
Miserable.

28:42.052 --> 28:44.153
Clients are running scared.

28:44.221 --> 28:46.823
I'm used to having
my ideas rejected, not me.

28:48.625 --> 28:50.827
How do you do it?

28:50.894 --> 28:53.429
My job is to present facts.

28:53.497 --> 28:56.566
If they're unhappy with the
agency, it's not my problem.

29:00.070 --> 29:02.071
Who's unhappy?

29:02.139 --> 29:05.308
Come on.
Clients are always unhappy.

29:08.212 --> 29:09.245
Like who?

29:11.582 --> 29:13.015
- Are you kidding?
- No.

29:13.083 --> 29:15.151
Why? I'm drowning here.

29:15.219 --> 29:17.153
You know I can't do that.

29:17.221 --> 29:19.088
If a client is unhappy, they're unhappy.

29:19.156 --> 29:21.557
There's nothing against telling
them to have dinner with me.

29:21.625 --> 29:24.026
If you don't want to, tell me who they are.
I'll call 'em out of the blue.

29:24.094 --> 29:25.995
I can't do that.

29:26.063 --> 29:28.931
Sure you can.
Who'll know?

29:28.999 --> 29:31.167
The standard of ethics on this
business is low enough.

29:31.235 --> 29:33.836
God knows I've done
some things I'm not proud of,

29:33.904 --> 29:35.805
but those other agencies pay me.

29:35.873 --> 29:37.540
What about protecting the clients?

29:37.608 --> 29:40.610
So I'm gonna kill my
business to save yours?

29:40.677 --> 29:43.346
It's not your business.
It's Atherton's. This is different.

29:43.414 --> 29:45.615
- This is everything to me.
- I don't believe this.

29:45.682 --> 29:48.317
You want a shoulder to cry on, fine.

29:48.385 --> 29:51.187
You want to throw me to the wolves
so you can save your neck, forget it.

29:51.255 --> 29:53.222
- I would do it for you.
- I would never ask.

29:53.290 --> 29:55.425
I would never use you like that

29:55.492 --> 29:56.926
because I know the difference

29:56.994 --> 29:59.328
between what we have
and this stupid office.

30:13.110 --> 30:15.878
<i>- ( Intercom buzzes ) - Woman: Mr. Cosgrove
says Playtex just left the hotel.</i>

30:15.946 --> 30:17.713
Thank you.

30:17.781 --> 30:19.382
God, I'm so nervous.

30:20.517 --> 30:22.552
You need to relax.

30:22.619 --> 30:25.588
I can't do this drunk.

30:25.656 --> 30:27.623
I know a technique

30:27.691 --> 30:30.460
that can really take the nerves away.

30:32.196 --> 30:34.030
I learned it from a yogi.

30:34.097 --> 30:35.264
( Lock clicks )

30:37.734 --> 30:39.735
( Clears throat )

30:39.803 --> 30:42.205
- Show me.
- Close your eyes.

30:42.272 --> 30:45.141
- Take a deep breath.
- ( Inhales )

30:45.209 --> 30:47.944
Fill your lungs until you can't anymore.

30:49.413 --> 30:51.447
Stick out your stomach.

30:51.515 --> 30:54.450
Now release it in a cool
stream right in my face.

30:54.518 --> 30:56.352
( Exhales )

30:56.420 --> 30:58.354
Hey! What are you doing?

30:58.422 --> 31:00.423
You said you wanted to relax, so...

31:00.491 --> 31:02.725
- Let's relax.
- Stan, no.

31:02.793 --> 31:05.962
Oh, come on. You're so horny
I can smell it on your breath.

31:06.029 --> 31:07.697
Stan, knock it off.

31:07.764 --> 31:10.600
Hey, I saw you with
the delivery boy yesterday.

31:10.667 --> 31:12.301
What? He's my boyfriend.

31:12.369 --> 31:15.605
Oh, come on, baby.
It's the end of the world.

31:20.344 --> 31:22.078
Why do you keep making me reject you?

31:24.147 --> 31:26.482
I was trying to do you a favor.

31:26.550 --> 31:29.151
Well, thank you. I'm not anxious anymore.

31:41.064 --> 31:43.399
<i>( Footsteps )</i>

31:46.136 --> 31:49.372
- Should I get the door?
- No. It didn't get any worse.

31:49.439 --> 31:51.507
What exactly did he say?

31:51.575 --> 31:53.476
He said they were terrified
about the British

31:53.544 --> 31:55.711
banning cigarette ads from TV
and they need to cut costs.

31:57.748 --> 31:59.415
Maybe it's a good time
to get out of this business.

31:59.483 --> 32:01.584
That's crap. Sales were up 10%.

32:01.652 --> 32:04.020
You do what you can do.

32:06.390 --> 32:08.190
David Montgomery's memorial
is in 40 minutes

32:08.258 --> 32:10.726
- at the River Cub.
- David Montgomery died?

32:10.794 --> 32:13.229
( Chuckles )
Well, there's your silver lining.

32:13.297 --> 32:15.131
Who the hell wants to go to that?

32:15.198 --> 32:16.933
We're trying to get new accounts.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.302
- Remember how to do that?
- You wanna dogpile on me?

32:19.369 --> 32:20.836
Saving that account was impossible.

32:20.904 --> 32:22.572
Because you ignored it!

32:22.639 --> 32:24.707
One damn account and you ignored it.

32:24.775 --> 32:26.709
You don't know what you're talking about.
Pete, explain it to him.

32:26.777 --> 32:28.277
You squeezed me off of it, Roger.

32:28.345 --> 32:30.046
You wanted it all to yourself.

32:30.113 --> 32:31.981
He would have never let this happen.

32:32.049 --> 32:33.849
But you do what you can
do which is nothing.

32:33.917 --> 32:36.285
Hey. You're the one who dragged
me into your amateur hour.

32:36.353 --> 32:38.521
I was perfectly happy where I was.

32:38.589 --> 32:40.957
Why did I do it? Out of friendship.

32:41.024 --> 32:43.225
But now that the account's gone,
I guess that went with it.

32:43.293 --> 32:45.995
Get out of here, all of you.
Go chase a hearse.

32:47.464 --> 32:48.531
Sorry to interrupt.

32:48.599 --> 32:50.466
Mr. Campbell, your father-in-law called.

32:50.534 --> 32:52.902
Your wife and your daughter
are resting comfortably.

32:52.970 --> 32:55.137
Oh. Just now?

32:55.205 --> 32:57.640
Yes, it happened. You've got a baby girl.

32:57.708 --> 33:00.209
- All: Congratulations.
- Bert: Good job.

33:00.277 --> 33:02.478
Thank you, Megan.

33:04.448 --> 33:08.584
- Okay, we should get going.
- Don: Let me get my coat.

33:16.093 --> 33:17.326
Where does Draper get off?

33:19.129 --> 33:21.631
Lee Garner Jr. never took you seriously

33:21.698 --> 33:23.799
because you never took yourself seriously.

33:35.245 --> 33:36.879
- Are you ready?
- Mmm.

33:37.981 --> 33:39.949
No hard feelings?

33:40.017 --> 33:42.251
None at all.

33:42.319 --> 33:43.986
Everything good?

33:46.356 --> 33:47.556
Absolutely.

33:49.292 --> 33:51.227
And so I think about that night...

33:51.294 --> 33:54.897
Staring out the window
of that Detroit hotel room,

33:54.965 --> 33:58.534
knowing we were
going home with Buick

33:58.602 --> 34:01.504
and saying to David,

34:01.571 --> 34:04.140
"is this the best thing
we're ever going to do?"

34:05.876 --> 34:09.245
Lynn, it was your fifth birthday.

34:09.312 --> 34:12.514
<i>The next day when we were in the airport,</i>

34:12.581 --> 34:15.317
<i>he showed me this pendant he'd
bought the day before downtown.</i>

34:15.385 --> 34:18.187
As he closed the box, he said,

34:18.255 --> 34:22.425
"Crosby, that's the best
thing I'll ever do."

34:22.492 --> 34:24.659
I know it's hard,

34:24.728 --> 34:26.962
but Dave loved you more
than anything, sweetheart.

34:29.933 --> 34:32.534
( Softly ) That's Stu Carlsbad
from Ralston Purina.

34:32.601 --> 34:34.536
He's always ripe.

34:34.603 --> 34:36.605
( Softly )
We have dog food experience.

34:36.672 --> 34:38.474
I've got him.

34:38.542 --> 34:40.443
<i>Man: I don't know how prepared I am,</i>

34:40.510 --> 34:43.112
but Dave was always a fan of winging it.

34:43.179 --> 34:45.047
( All chuckle softly )

34:46.949 --> 34:48.984
Beth, his beautiful wife.

34:49.052 --> 34:50.719
You were there before he made partner

34:50.786 --> 34:52.455
and then you gave him to us,

34:52.522 --> 34:55.190
<i>but you know you and Lynnie</i>

34:55.257 --> 34:57.960
<i>were always on his mind.</i>

34:58.028 --> 34:59.829
True story.

34:59.896 --> 35:02.732
We'd been in London for three months

35:02.799 --> 35:04.567
trying to nail down British Petroleum.

35:06.069 --> 35:09.271
<i>- Never happened.
- ( All chuckle softly )</i>

35:09.339 --> 35:12.141
But once a week he would
drag me to Portobello Road

35:12.209 --> 35:15.411
looking for thimbles
for your collection, Lynn.

35:15.479 --> 35:18.247
<i>Silver thimbles.</i>

35:18.315 --> 35:20.149
<i>And he was an expert.</i>

35:24.221 --> 35:26.489
It's because Playtex is strong enough

35:26.556 --> 35:28.290
to protect a woman's hands.

35:28.358 --> 35:31.894
Through her fingertips, she
can dry the tears of a child

35:31.962 --> 35:36.198
<i>or feel the warmth of her husband's skin.</i>

35:36.266 --> 35:38.434
Playtex protects a woman's touch.

35:42.038 --> 35:44.740
It's very romantic. I have to admit

35:44.808 --> 35:48.110
when you first brought it up, I didn't
think that was possible for latex gloves.

35:48.178 --> 35:50.045
These images are about the moments

35:50.113 --> 35:52.681
<i>after the housework is over.</i>

35:57.120 --> 35:59.722
They're about the meaningful life

35:59.790 --> 36:01.791
a woman leads when work is done.

36:03.493 --> 36:05.294
Well, I feel pretty good about this.

36:05.362 --> 36:06.529
Peggy, our pleasure.

36:08.565 --> 36:10.332
We're thrilled to get this
in the first try.

36:10.400 --> 36:12.268
Well, I'm gonna let you
get back to the hotel

36:12.335 --> 36:14.136
and then steaks and a show.

36:20.410 --> 36:22.111
That went well.

36:22.179 --> 36:23.879
You have lipstick all over your teeth.

36:23.947 --> 36:25.681
What?

36:44.957 --> 36:47.425
- Why are you still here?
- I didn't know if I should leave or not.

36:47.493 --> 36:51.229
- How was the funeral?
- We'll see.

36:51.297 --> 36:53.164
Get me the campaign briefs
on Ken's accounts

36:53.232 --> 36:54.966
and then you can go.

36:55.034 --> 36:56.468
And send Peggy in.

37:02.541 --> 37:04.409
( Sighs )

37:09.949 --> 37:12.450
<i>( Footsteps )</i>

37:12.518 --> 37:13.918
Miss Olson's gone for the night,

37:13.986 --> 37:15.820
- but if you need help...
- Did you do that?

37:18.390 --> 37:20.391
I thought in the end you
wouldn't want to throw it away.

37:22.528 --> 37:24.529
You're wrong.

37:24.597 --> 37:25.897
That commercial was great

37:25.965 --> 37:27.765
and nothing they do can change that.

37:29.401 --> 37:30.935
I'll take those.

37:34.507 --> 37:36.674
Thank you. You can go.

37:40.579 --> 37:42.280
You sure you don't want some help?

37:42.348 --> 37:44.849
This is a little complicated.

37:44.917 --> 37:48.253
That's okay. I'd really like
to learn what goes on here.

37:48.320 --> 37:49.988
( Flatly ) Really.

37:50.055 --> 37:52.357
Well, first of all,
I think it would help me

37:52.424 --> 37:54.692
from making mistakes with
your work the way I have.

37:54.760 --> 37:57.795
And secondly,

37:57.863 --> 38:00.265
I think I'd like eventually
to do what you do

38:00.332 --> 38:01.833
or what Miss Olson does.

38:04.103 --> 38:06.371
- I didn't know that.
- Unless you'd rather be alone.

38:06.438 --> 38:07.906
I don't want to be in the way.

38:07.973 --> 38:10.008
No. I don't mind.

38:21.520 --> 38:23.788
This is a strategy statement

38:23.856 --> 38:27.392
signed by Fillmore Auto Parts.

38:29.261 --> 38:31.930
Copywriters stray from
these midstream sometimes

38:31.997 --> 38:33.965
if they have a better idea,

38:34.033 --> 38:35.733
but we can't take that chance now.

38:35.801 --> 38:38.269
Wouldn't clients want a better idea?

38:42.074 --> 38:44.375
What'd you like about the commercial?

38:44.443 --> 38:46.210
( Laughs ) Oh.

38:46.278 --> 38:47.812
You're putting me on the spot. Um...

38:49.748 --> 38:53.484
I know it's a floor wax, but I
really remember that feeling

38:53.552 --> 38:55.553
of being a little kid

38:55.621 --> 38:58.489
and feeling like I was being punished
when my mother cleaned the house.

39:00.626 --> 39:02.427
- Where are you from?
- Montreal.

39:02.494 --> 39:04.729
We didn't have Glo-coat.

39:04.797 --> 39:07.966
- Why'd you move here?
- Well, first of all, it's New York.

39:08.033 --> 39:09.901
For an artist, it's Mecca.

39:09.969 --> 39:11.669
You're an artist?

39:11.737 --> 39:13.838
I wouldn't say I'm an artist.

39:13.906 --> 39:16.207
I'm an artistic person.
I majored in literature

39:16.275 --> 39:19.010
and I've dabbled in writing and painting

39:19.078 --> 39:21.079
and a little bit of acting.

39:21.146 --> 39:23.047
( Giggles )

39:24.783 --> 39:26.217
What are you laughing about?

39:26.285 --> 39:27.885
Because I just realized

39:27.953 --> 39:29.821
I know everything about you.

39:29.888 --> 39:31.823
I mean, you're in my head all day,

39:31.890 --> 39:35.059
even when I go home.
And you don't know anything about me.

39:35.127 --> 39:37.695
<i>Well, you haven't been here that long.</i>

39:37.763 --> 39:40.331
And you don't know how long I will be,

39:40.399 --> 39:42.000
so why get to know me?

39:44.970 --> 39:48.239
I can see that's what everybody must think.

39:48.307 --> 39:50.308
You judge people on their work.

39:50.376 --> 39:52.677
I'm the same way.

39:54.079 --> 39:55.913
Everything else is sentimental.

39:59.184 --> 40:01.452
- You want one?
- How many is that?

40:04.556 --> 40:07.358
( Laughs ) Four.

40:12.164 --> 40:15.533
I know you're angry, but
I hope you're not afraid

40:15.601 --> 40:17.368
because you will get through this.

40:19.772 --> 40:21.205
You don't know that.

40:23.409 --> 40:25.043
Why do you care what I think?

40:37.690 --> 40:39.424
Megan, I don't think this is a good idea.

40:41.160 --> 40:42.894
This has nothing to do with work.

40:51.203 --> 40:53.638
I can't make any mistakes right now.

40:56.341 --> 40:58.409
Let's be clear.

40:58.477 --> 41:00.411
I'm not gonna run out of
here crying tomorrow.

41:02.181 --> 41:04.082
I just want you right now.

41:17.496 --> 41:19.297
<i>( Music playing softly )</i>

41:26.371 --> 41:28.439
Hey. Where are you going?

41:30.209 --> 41:32.744
I'm exhausted.

41:35.080 --> 41:37.315
How was your day?

41:37.382 --> 41:38.950
Fine.

41:39.017 --> 41:40.985
I know how to make it better.

41:41.053 --> 41:43.554
I'm really tired.

41:43.622 --> 41:45.123
Sit down.

41:57.336 --> 41:58.836
What'd you buy?

42:00.372 --> 42:02.306
Look.

42:05.277 --> 42:07.178
( Sighs )

42:08.847 --> 42:10.515
Look at it.

42:18.924 --> 42:21.058
Sign it.

42:38.544 --> 42:40.444
"To my loving wife."

42:41.613 --> 42:43.281
( Softly ) Oh.

42:55.994 --> 42:57.895
I'm so proud of you.

43:17.449 --> 43:20.051
You should go first.
Actually, I should go first.

43:22.988 --> 43:24.822
( Sighs )

43:29.027 --> 43:30.661
Do you want to grab a bite?

43:32.231 --> 43:33.931
I want you to go home

43:33.999 --> 43:36.000
and I want you to sleep.

43:36.068 --> 43:38.536
And I don't want you
drinking any more tonight.

43:51.917 --> 43:53.818
Wait. Did you want to go first?

43:55.988 --> 43:57.655
Good night, Mr. Draper.

44:06.098 --> 44:08.199
<i>( Keys jingling )</i>

44:12.671 --> 44:14.572
Didn't expect to see you here.

44:14.640 --> 44:17.174
I was gonna call,

44:17.242 --> 44:19.844
but I didn't want to do
this over the phone.

44:19.912 --> 44:22.146
So you were gonna write it on an envelope.

44:22.214 --> 44:24.715
Can I come inside?

44:48.740 --> 44:50.908
I got you a meeting with Heinz.

44:53.078 --> 44:56.414
It's vinegar, sauces and beans.

44:56.481 --> 44:59.016
They're at Ketchum Macleod
and they're restless.

45:01.320 --> 45:03.421
- Faye.
- I thought about what you said,

45:03.488 --> 45:05.990
I thought about you...

45:08.160 --> 45:11.262
And I thought about... Whatever.
You are my life right now.

45:14.266 --> 45:16.500
You didn't have to do this.

45:19.371 --> 45:20.371
I wanted to.

45:34.152 --> 45:35.886
Thank you.

45:37.055 --> 45:38.522
You're welcome.

45:42.127 --> 45:43.894
Do you wanna stay?

45:45.597 --> 45:47.932
I'll probably fall asleep on you.

46:03.115 --> 46:04.615
Just sit with me.
