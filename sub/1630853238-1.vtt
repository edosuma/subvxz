00:21.750 --> 00:22.791


00:45.416 --> 00:49.166
I am sick of this, Gabe.
I do fucking everything for you.

00:49.750 --> 00:51.083
I am your goddamn mother.

00:51.166 --> 00:53.125
-Oh really, Mom? Mom of the year.

00:53.208 --> 00:56.208
You're fucking lucky
I didn't call the fucking police on you.

00:56.291 --> 00:58.416
You're fucking lucky
she didn't call the police on you.

00:58.500 --> 00:59.916
Do you wanna be on my side?

01:00.000 --> 01:03.666
I will always be on your side, Gabe.
I'm always on your side.

01:03.750 --> 01:07.125
You're doing a fucking great job…
I look like a fucking idiot.

01:07.208 --> 01:09.416
I look like a fucking idiot.
You screaming at me.

01:09.500 --> 01:11.500
-All my friends are watching.
-Did you see her face?

01:11.583 --> 01:15.583
Did you see the way she looked at me?
And your father did nothing.

01:15.666 --> 01:17.541
Ha! He's too busy
living in the '80s.

01:17.625 --> 01:21.125
He's… He's playing with his toys.
His weird, creepy shit.

01:21.625 --> 01:24.125
-Oh, give me a break.

03:23.166 --> 03:24.875
Cool.

03:31.833 --> 03:33.708
Retro… Retro… Retro weirdos.

03:33.791 --> 03:35.083
Hiding in the '80s.

03:35.166 --> 03:38.041
Who the…
Who the fuck is Barry Newman anyway?

03:38.125 --> 03:41.458
It's Gary Numan. It's Gary…
It's… It's Gary Numan.

03:41.541 --> 03:44.083
He fucks his vinyl
more than you… you… you…

03:44.166 --> 03:47.583
-"His tongue? Her ears?"
-Those old movies… suck.

03:51.916 --> 03:53.166
What?

03:53.250 --> 03:55.333
"His tongue? Her ears?"

03:55.916 --> 03:58.458
He's just a fucking loser.
He's just a fucking loser.

03:58.541 --> 04:02.250
-Loser… Loser… Loser…

04:20.666 --> 04:21.500
Guys?

04:27.125 --> 04:29.250
-Laura?

04:29.333 --> 04:30.416
Honey?

04:36.458 --> 04:39.291
I don't know what happened.

06:53.250 --> 06:54.166
It's short.

06:54.916 --> 06:57.500
I got less out of you than the others.
You're lazy.

06:57.583 --> 06:58.958
I'm pregnant.

06:59.041 --> 07:00.791
So you're stupid and lazy.

07:01.750 --> 07:03.250
Don't speak to her like that.

07:04.416 --> 07:06.000
Maybe I don't need you tonight.

07:06.583 --> 07:07.458
Come on.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.916
You think you're special.
You're not fucking special.

God, you're so beautiful.

08:35.750 --> 08:36.833
Hey. Hey!

08:36.916 --> 08:38.583
How is the character design coming?

08:38.666 --> 08:40.333
-Uh, great.
-Want me to check your code?

08:40.416 --> 08:43.041
Mmm, no. No. I am…

08:44.458 --> 08:46.375
-Okay.
-You got the nose wrong.

08:47.375 --> 08:50.833
It is not… It's not supposed to be…
It's just an idea.

08:50.916 --> 08:51.833
It's just an idea.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.916
Oh, what is that?

08:59.416 --> 09:01.958
-What do you mean? What, Fad Gadget?
-Come on.

09:02.041 --> 09:05.000
Synth pioneer from the greatest decade
in pop-culture history?

09:05.083 --> 09:07.666
You shouldn't listen to stuff like that.
It's bad for you.

09:07.750 --> 09:08.583
It's not ba…

09:09.500 --> 09:11.500
You loved the last thing I played for you.

09:14.291 --> 09:15.250
Run-DMC.

09:16.083 --> 09:19.166
You think you turned me on to Run-DMC?

09:25.791 --> 09:27.166
How's that job hunt going?

09:27.250 --> 09:29.625
I'm on 27 "fuck yous" and counting, so…

09:29.708 --> 09:32.708
That's why you don't drop out.
You gotta go back and graduate.

09:40.708 --> 09:43.666
Well, hey, look, once my game's picked up,

09:43.750 --> 09:46.375
you can come program for me, full-time.

09:46.458 --> 09:47.791
At the House of Isaac?

09:50.791 --> 09:52.166
-The House of Isaac?
-Yeah.

09:52.250 --> 09:53.666
That's actually pretty good.

09:55.708 --> 09:56.625
Nice.

09:56.708 --> 09:58.875
Just some, like,
solders need fixing.

09:58.958 --> 10:00.208
Nice.

10:00.291 --> 10:02.458
This thing is
a retro collector's wet dream.

10:02.541 --> 10:04.708
-Is 70 okay?
-They're only selling them for 90.

10:04.791 --> 10:08.083
But I am paying for the art.

10:24.291 --> 10:25.208
New stock?

10:25.958 --> 10:28.875
Yeah. I mean, it's just
a load of junk really, but…

10:28.958 --> 10:30.166
Sorry. Oh…

10:30.250 --> 10:33.083
God, it's, uh… Sorry about the mess.

10:33.166 --> 10:34.916
I've seen it a lot worse.

10:36.500 --> 10:39.666
My mom won't eat here.
She says it's not sanitary.

10:39.750 --> 10:41.583
I mean, I don't really like eating here,

10:41.666 --> 10:45.041
with the bugs and the overwhelming sense
of existential…

10:45.125 --> 10:48.250
Hey, you eaten? There's this karaoke place
that does breakfast.

10:48.333 --> 10:50.666
They make you sing
before they bring out the menu.

10:50.750 --> 10:51.875
We could do our duet--

10:51.958 --> 10:53.833
Hey, I can try and clean this up for you.

10:53.916 --> 10:56.000
Yeah, sure, uh, take it.

11:02.041 --> 11:03.791
-Um…
-What's this?

11:05.875 --> 11:07.750
Uh, I don't… know?

11:08.458 --> 11:09.833
Looks like a bootleg.

11:10.958 --> 11:12.833
With a 125 grand prize?

11:13.458 --> 11:14.708
Curs>r.

11:15.500 --> 11:17.208
That's actually quite a good name.

11:17.708 --> 11:19.166
Not as good as Ghoster, but…

11:20.666 --> 11:22.375
Think the prize is still good?

11:22.458 --> 11:26.833
I don't know. I mean, there are a ton
of unclaimed prizes from retro games.

11:27.666 --> 11:29.875
Couple of months ago,
I read about this guy.

11:29.958 --> 11:33.708
He was the first person in 34 years
to complete Thou Art Dead.

11:34.250 --> 11:38.416
He found a treasure chest in a dungeon
with a bank account number.

11:42.041 --> 11:46.125
Greetings,
this is Robert Englund,

11:46.208 --> 11:48.458
horror royalty and Hollywood nightmare.

11:48.541 --> 11:49.666
No fucking way.

11:49.750 --> 11:51.625
Or should that be
the other way around?

11:51.708 --> 11:52.666
What?

11:52.750 --> 11:55.833
If you're listening to this,
then you're either a loser

11:55.916 --> 11:58.041
who isn't paying
Mommy and Daddy's phone bill,

11:58.125 --> 11:59.666
or you have survived Curs>r.

11:59.750 --> 12:01.250
-That is so cool!

12:01.750 --> 12:05.041
-What is--
-So, congratulations.

12:05.125 --> 12:07.416
You are worthy.

12:07.500 --> 12:09.166
-Oh my God.
-What? Who is that?

12:09.250 --> 12:11.458
Enter your four-digit prize code
after the tone.

12:11.541 --> 12:16.291
-"Who's that?" Fuck yeah.
-And remember, reality is cursed.

12:16.375 --> 12:17.541
That is so cool!

12:17.625 --> 12:21.000
Spend that money wisely, kiddos.

12:21.083 --> 12:22.791
-Robert Englund?

12:23.416 --> 12:24.750
Who the fuck is that?

12:25.416 --> 12:26.375
Oh, come on.

12:27.375 --> 12:30.333
Oh, you…
Your pop-culture ignorance

12:30.416 --> 12:32.875
is becoming unacceptable, bitch.

12:34.375 --> 12:35.625
You know that. You know that.

12:35.708 --> 12:38.541
I just-- I didn't just call you a bitch.

12:38.625 --> 12:39.500
Oh God.

12:40.125 --> 12:41.458
Could be easy money.

12:43.583 --> 12:47.500
Yeah. Yeah. Wait, no.
Technically, that is mine.

12:48.291 --> 12:51.041
-You know Wilkies on 37th?
-Yes, I do.

12:51.125 --> 12:53.208
Meet me there tonight at…

12:55.208 --> 12:56.125
- 30.

12:57.375 --> 12:59.000
-It's a date.
-It's a deal.

13:03.000 --> 13:06.041
-Just help yourself.

13:31.833 --> 13:34.666
I work! I work! I vacuum. I…

13:35.541 --> 13:36.458
I'm home.

13:44.166 --> 13:46.125
…record our voices, okay?

13:46.208 --> 13:47.666
-Ready?
-I wanna go swimming.

13:47.750 --> 13:49.541
We're gonna
go swimming in a minute.

13:49.625 --> 13:51.458
-Ricky--
-Will you look this time?

13:51.541 --> 13:54.083
What are you talking about?
I always look.

13:54.166 --> 13:57.708
You didn't look
when I did my big jump last week.

13:57.791 --> 14:01.000
Right, let's do it again.
Three, two, one.

14:01.916 --> 14:03.166
Love you, Mommy.

14:07.625 --> 14:10.000
You see here,
we have to talk in the ear

14:10.083 --> 14:12.333
and then it will record our voices, okay?

14:12.416 --> 14:14.125
-Ready?
-I wanna go swimming.

14:14.208 --> 14:16.041
We're gonna
go swimming in a minute.

14:16.125 --> 14:17.916
-Ricky--
-Will you look this time?

14:18.000 --> 14:20.458
What are you talking about?
I always look.

14:20.541 --> 14:23.666
You didn't look
when I did my big jump last week.

14:24.208 --> 14:27.458
Right, let's do it again.
Three, two, one.

14:28.416 --> 14:29.625
Love you, Mommy.

14:42.958 --> 14:43.791
Mom.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.375
Don't let Lance in here again.

14:48.916 --> 14:50.000
He's not helping you.

14:53.291 --> 14:54.250
The walls.

14:55.916 --> 14:56.791
Huh?

14:58.416 --> 14:59.416
The rats…

15:01.416 --> 15:02.750
they're in the walls now.

15:04.291 --> 15:05.291
They're hungry.

15:07.875 --> 15:10.333
I'll, uh, set another trap later.

15:19.625 --> 15:22.083
I was thinking
we could go for a walk tomorrow.

15:23.333 --> 15:25.333
To the park maybe?

15:29.750 --> 15:31.666
You see here,
we have to talk in the ear

15:31.750 --> 15:34.458
and then it will record our voices, okay?

15:34.541 --> 15:35.958
-Ready?
-I wanna go swimming.

15:36.041 --> 15:36.875

-Hey, Carmella?
-Hmm?

16:26.291 --> 16:29.000
Ever wonder why
they have us doing this shit?

16:29.875 --> 16:32.041
'Cause they think it's all we're good for.

16:32.875 --> 16:35.083
I mean, this place is fucking empty.

16:35.750 --> 16:38.208
They got us cleaning the floors
night after night.

16:38.708 --> 16:42.708
Oh yeah, I've given it a lot of thought
over the past few months.

16:43.291 --> 16:46.250
Pushed it around in my mind, you know?
Really considered it.

16:47.166 --> 16:52.291
Last week, I finally settled
on what you might call a firm conclusion.

16:53.958 --> 16:56.666
Long as they keep paying me,
I don't give a fuck.

17:39.958 --> 17:41.958
-

17:42.041 --> 17:44.041


17:50.291 --> 17:51.750
You gonna order something else?

17:54.541 --> 18:00.250
Sorry, I'd let you sit there all night,
but my asshole boss wakes up, then…

18:04.291 --> 18:05.125
Give me a minute.

18:05.208 --> 18:06.583
Yeah, sure.

18:07.625 --> 18:08.791
Uh, menu's right there.

18:55.041 --> 18:55.916
Coffee.

18:57.166 --> 18:58.125
Say "when."

18:58.916 --> 19:00.250
-Did you--
-Not saying "when."

19:00.333 --> 19:02.291
-I'm just gonna keep pouring.
-When. When.

19:02.375 --> 19:04.250
I'm only messing with you.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.041
Sorry.

19:06.125 --> 19:07.833
Are you-- Are you all right?

19:14.458 --> 19:16.583
I'm okay.

19:19.166 --> 19:21.625
You do not look okay.

19:27.041 --> 19:28.500
Hey, how'd you do that?

19:30.458 --> 19:31.291
Do what?

19:34.666 --> 19:38.875
To my screen. The words came up
right when you said them.

19:40.375 --> 19:44.500
I think that maybe
we both need some sleep.

19:57.291 --> 20:00.458
-You have to choose, Kayla.

20:02.916 --> 20:04.166
Choose or die.

20:22.458 --> 20:25.041
I gotta take a fucking break. Yes.

20:50.083 --> 20:51.500
Clean up.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
Stop!

22:01.916 --> 22:02.750
Please.

22:03.916 --> 22:06.541
I… I can't.

22:08.125 --> 22:09.916
I can't…

22:13.333 --> 22:15.583
It hurts. It hurts.

22:15.666 --> 22:16.916
Stop!

22:17.000 --> 22:19.041
I can't stop.

22:19.625 --> 22:21.875
-Help her. We have to help--

22:28.875 --> 22:31.416
-Please. Please stop.

22:40.416 --> 22:42.666
-Fuck. Help!

22:42.750 --> 22:43.958
I can't…

22:44.458 --> 22:46.833
-Fuck.

23:37.708 --> 23:40.708
-What's that supposed to mean?
-It's just a question.

23:41.250 --> 23:43.208
-She's my daughter.
-Of course.

23:43.291 --> 23:45.083
She works very hard.

23:45.166 --> 23:46.875
I didn't mean
to suggest anything.

23:48.500 --> 23:51.958
My colleague spoke to Kayla
at the scene of the suicide last night.

23:52.458 --> 23:54.875
This is a real tragedy.

23:55.500 --> 23:56.958
My family's seen its fair share.

23:58.500 --> 24:00.875
There used to be three of us.

24:02.875 --> 24:04.208
It's… It's okay.

24:05.416 --> 24:07.333
This your little boy in the picture here?

24:08.916 --> 24:09.750
That's him.

24:11.708 --> 24:13.041
Losing a kid is the toughest.

24:14.333 --> 24:16.708
Got my own two boys,
and I can't imagine ever--

24:16.791 --> 24:18.541
Can I get you a drink or something?

24:18.625 --> 24:19.791
No, I'm good.

24:21.541 --> 24:25.958
Once Kayla's rested, I'd like to follow up
on her statement if that's okay.

24:43.166 --> 24:45.166
This used to be a good neighborhood.

24:49.208 --> 24:50.250
We were happy.

24:52.291 --> 24:53.125
We were.

24:58.541 --> 24:59.541
You okay there, bump?

25:01.833 --> 25:03.666
You haven't called me that in years.

25:07.125 --> 25:09.375
-Mom, something happened--
-Is it still there?

25:11.791 --> 25:12.875
The pool.

25:18.250 --> 25:20.000
They tore it down, remember?

25:23.291 --> 25:25.666
-They don't work.
-They're all we can afford.

25:25.750 --> 25:26.791
Lance can help.

25:26.875 --> 25:29.583
You keep taking his shit,
you're gonna die. Is that what you want?

25:32.666 --> 25:33.875
Is that what you want?

25:40.208 --> 25:42.208
This used to be a good neighborhood.

25:44.041 --> 25:46.083
You see here,
we have to talk in the ear

25:46.166 --> 25:48.958
and then it will record our voices, okay?

25:49.041 --> 25:50.708
-Ready?
-I wanna go swimming.

25:52.875 --> 25:54.083
There's my girl.

25:55.958 --> 25:57.166
Saw you had a visit.

25:58.541 --> 26:00.541
-Fuck you, Lance.

26:01.333 --> 26:03.083
Can't have you talking about me.

26:04.541 --> 26:07.291
Pick up some coffee, would you?
Your mom's out.

26:07.875 --> 26:09.166
Stay the fuck away from her.

26:09.250 --> 26:12.750
Hey, it's my responsibility
to look out for the residents.

26:13.416 --> 26:15.500
There's no cure for what your mama's got.

26:16.250 --> 26:18.833
-I got the medicine--
-Keep that shit out of my house.

26:18.916 --> 26:23.041
-I know you guys been through a lot.
-You don't know anything about us.

26:25.375 --> 26:26.666
"Dear, Miss Edwards,

26:27.291 --> 26:32.333
thank you for your application
for the position of junior programmer."

26:34.500 --> 26:37.750
"Now, unfortunately,
we regret to inform you…" Ooh.

26:39.708 --> 26:42.958
When you gonna learn? Nobody around here
ever amounts to nothin'.

26:48.166 --> 26:49.708
Saw the eviction notice too.

26:49.791 --> 26:51.416
You need money, you come to me.

26:54.500 --> 26:55.583
Anything to help…

26:58.458 --> 27:00.291
Miss Edwards.

27:16.958 --> 27:20.333
I don't know how many more times
I can explain to you what happened.

27:20.416 --> 27:22.041
Yeah, I know. I know. It's just…

27:24.500 --> 27:27.458
I don't see how a video game
can kill someone.

27:28.500 --> 27:31.250
I mean Pac-Man
doesn't go around eating people.

27:32.416 --> 27:33.791
So what? I know what I saw.

27:33.875 --> 27:36.916
Yeah, no, I know, and she sounds crazy.

27:37.000 --> 27:38.916
She's not fucking crazy. She was fine.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.291
Everything was fine,
then the game took control.

27:41.375 --> 27:44.333
-Is that what you told the cops?
-It's what I'm telling you.

27:45.791 --> 27:47.041
You don't believe me?

27:48.458 --> 27:51.833
Kayla… Hey… Hey, I wanna believe you.

27:51.916 --> 27:54.083
-Just tell me where it came from.
-I don't know.

27:54.166 --> 27:56.708
I have no way of knowing.
It's house clearance.

27:56.791 --> 27:58.916
-Just in a lot--
-What fucking use are you?

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
Wait.

28:01.375 --> 28:02.708
Let me do some research.

28:03.291 --> 28:05.708
-I'll get to the bottom of this.
-Yeah, you do that.

28:06.250 --> 28:07.666
You're so fucking smart.

28:11.333 --> 28:12.166
Fuck.

28:38.958 --> 28:41.291
Kayla. Kayla! Kayla!

28:41.375 --> 28:43.333
Mom, what's wrong?
Why aren't you sleeping?

28:43.416 --> 28:46.250
I can… I can hear them.

28:46.333 --> 28:48.625
The rats. They're getting out.

28:48.708 --> 28:50.375
I'll set another trap later.

28:50.458 --> 28:52.208
-No, no, no.

28:52.291 --> 28:54.041
They're here! They're here!

28:54.125 --> 28:55.500
What are you talking about?

28:58.125 --> 28:59.541
-Kayla--

28:59.625 --> 29:00.750
-Shoo!

29:14.666 --> 29:15.833
Level two.

29:16.375 --> 29:18.625
You are in a tower.

29:22.791 --> 29:24.041
Please, Kay--

29:24.958 --> 29:26.875
Kayla, you have to help me.

29:26.958 --> 29:29.708
I can't do this on my own.

29:29.791 --> 29:32.333
I don't know what to do, Kayla.
I don't know what to do.

29:35.541 --> 29:36.833
You gotta get out of there.

29:36.916 --> 29:38.416
I can't get out. I can hear it.

29:38.500 --> 29:42.666
Choose.
The living room or the bathroom?

29:43.250 --> 29:45.125
Mom, you're… you're in the bedroom?

29:45.208 --> 29:46.666
Yeah, I'm in the bedroom.

29:46.750 --> 29:49.333
Choose or die.

29:49.916 --> 29:52.583
-Get to the living room.
-I can't. It's gonna see me.

29:52.666 --> 29:54.125
Go quick. Hide behind the couch.

29:54.208 --> 29:55.625
I can't. I can't move.

29:55.708 --> 29:57.750
-I cannot move from here!
-Trust me.

29:57.833 --> 30:00.416
Kayla, help me!
I'm gonna go and hide.

30:00.500 --> 30:02.333
-I'm gonna go and hide!
-No! No!

30:02.416 --> 30:04.041
It's destroying everything.

30:04.125 --> 30:05.000
I can hear it.

30:05.083 --> 30:08.000
There's no meat
in the living room. You're hungry.

30:08.083 --> 30:10.208
It's trying to make me hurt you.

30:10.291 --> 30:11.750
Bathroom or bedroom?

30:12.333 --> 30:14.166


30:14.250 --> 30:16.083
Choose or die.

30:18.083 --> 30:19.875
Wait there till I tell you to run.

30:19.958 --> 30:21.625
What? What? What?

30:22.208 --> 30:23.791
Run where? Run where?

30:23.875 --> 30:26.791
Bathroom. It's in the bathroom.
I want you to go right past.

30:26.875 --> 30:28.750
-Go straight for the front door.
-No.

30:28.833 --> 30:30.333
I need you to go right now.

30:30.416 --> 30:33.208
-Mom, do you see it? Go! Now!
-No, I cannot. I can't.

30:33.291 --> 30:34.125
Okay! Okay!

30:34.208 --> 30:36.625
There's no meat
in the bathroom.

30:36.708 --> 30:39.375
-

30:39.458 --> 30:41.166
-Meat.
-No, no, no!

30:43.250 --> 30:44.750
Shut the fucking door!

30:45.666 --> 30:47.625
The bedroom door is locked.

30:48.250 --> 30:50.833
Kayla, I don't know what to do!
I don't know what to do!

30:50.916 --> 30:52.541
-Help me!
-Charge it? Chew it?

30:52.625 --> 30:54.958
I can't do it, Kayla!
I can't do this!

30:56.500 --> 30:59.416
-Choose or die.

31:00.958 --> 31:05.916
Kayla, I love…
I love you, and I am so sorry.

31:06.000 --> 31:07.000
Go to the window.

31:07.083 --> 31:08.750
I can't do it, Kayla!

31:08.833 --> 31:11.916
-You have to!

31:12.500 --> 31:14.250
Choose or die.

31:14.333 --> 31:17.708
Kayla,
I can't hold the door!

31:17.791 --> 31:20.416
-Oh Jesus Christ!

31:20.500 --> 31:23.541
-Move, Mom!
-I can see it! I can see it!

31:23.625 --> 31:26.666
Help me! Somebody help me!

31:26.750 --> 31:28.750
The meat is so close
you can taste it.

31:28.833 --> 31:30.791
No, no, no!

31:30.875 --> 31:31.791
Jump.

31:31.875 --> 31:33.166
It's too high!

31:33.250 --> 31:35.041
I can't!

31:36.041 --> 31:39.375
-Jump out the fucking window!

31:49.333 --> 31:51.000
A worthy player.

31:51.083 --> 31:55.875
Same time again tomorrow for more terror.

32:00.666 --> 32:02.750
Kayla! What the fuck?

32:06.083 --> 32:07.333
You are fired.

32:19.750 --> 32:22.333
...on line 1.

32:34.916 --> 32:36.041
-Where's Ricky?
-Mom.

32:36.125 --> 32:37.041
Ricky.

32:39.541 --> 32:40.708
He wants to go swimming.

32:41.291 --> 32:43.083
Why did you say that? Did you see him?

33:02.125 --> 33:04.583
I can… I can hear them.

33:05.083 --> 33:07.375
The rats. They're getting out.

33:10.666 --> 33:12.916
You are in a tower.

33:19.750 --> 33:22.416
-They're here! They're here!

33:29.125 --> 33:32.458
Kayla, I don't know what to do!
I don't know what to do!

33:32.541 --> 33:33.833
You have to help me!

33:34.833 --> 33:37.416
Choose or die.

33:39.083 --> 33:42.625
Kayla, I don't wanna die.

33:50.666 --> 33:52.750
There's no meat
in the living room.

33:52.833 --> 33:53.875
You're hungry.

34:10.125 --> 34:13.166
Kayla, I can't hold the door!

34:13.916 --> 34:15.666
Oh Jesus Christ!

34:20.625 --> 34:22.583
Somebody help me!

34:43.708 --> 34:45.333
-Meat.

34:47.541 --> 34:50.750
You trashed the place, huh?
Landlord's gonna love this.

34:50.833 --> 34:52.458
-Get out.
-I gotta report it.

34:53.250 --> 34:54.875
-Unless…
-Fuck you.

34:54.958 --> 34:55.791
Maybe.

34:55.875 --> 34:57.000
What are you worth?

34:57.750 --> 34:59.750
Ten dollars? Fifteen for the hour?

34:59.833 --> 35:02.375
You take one more step,
you'll find out what I'm worth.

35:05.541 --> 35:08.791
Everyone in the neighborhood
used to look to your mom and be like…

35:09.541 --> 35:10.416
Well…

35:11.500 --> 35:13.000
she was really somethin'.

35:14.416 --> 35:16.791
Anyone was gonna make it out,
it was gonna be her.

35:25.916 --> 35:26.875
I got a 20.

35:58.625 --> 35:59.750
I am coming.

36:02.958 --> 36:03.833
Kayla?

36:04.541 --> 36:06.500
-What the fuck?
-You have to believe me.

36:07.000 --> 36:09.708
I… I believe you.
I believe you. Come inside.

36:09.791 --> 36:12.541
This is some fucked up shit.
Be sure before you get involved.

36:12.625 --> 36:13.458
I'm sure.

36:13.958 --> 36:16.083
I'm sure, okay?
Just get in. You're soaked.

36:19.625 --> 36:22.583
You weren't kidding.
This is some fucked up shit.

36:25.500 --> 36:26.583
Can we turn it on?

36:27.125 --> 36:28.125
I tried.

36:29.416 --> 36:33.125
But listen, I checked what time
it started itself up last night.- 00 a.m.

36:33.208 --> 36:35.791
Same time as when I first opened it
the night before.

36:35.875 --> 36:37.625
I think we gotta wait till then.

36:45.041 --> 36:47.958
Look, I'm sorry about yesterday.

36:48.041 --> 36:50.625
Okay? After you left,
I tried to find out what I could.

36:50.708 --> 36:53.750
It was a dead end.
And there's nothing online.

36:53.833 --> 36:56.541
Literally. Not even an honorary mention
on the forums.

36:56.625 --> 36:58.291
The prize line number's delisted.

36:59.625 --> 37:03.500
I wanted to see if somehow
it was much more contemporary technology,

37:03.583 --> 37:06.083
but there's nothing in the code
that'd begin to explain…

37:06.166 --> 37:09.208
I mean, yeah,
it's just ordinary wrapper code.

37:10.250 --> 37:12.375
Yeah,
so what's inside the wrapper?

37:13.208 --> 37:17.000
Well, some old games have code hidden
in the analog loading sound itself.

37:17.708 --> 37:20.833
-Sound is data.
-We could try to separate out the sound?

37:21.541 --> 37:22.500
Yes, we should.

37:23.000 --> 37:24.541
Yes, we should, Kayla.

37:25.125 --> 37:26.375
Okay.

37:28.458 --> 37:29.583
Where are you?

37:32.125 --> 37:33.750
When it loads, we'll be ready.

37:38.083 --> 37:41.416
You know what I mean? I feel like
we're just scratching the surface

37:41.500 --> 37:43.875
of interaction in, like, player choices.

37:43.958 --> 37:47.000
Even just cheat codes.
They're cool, but they're a bit standard.

37:47.083 --> 37:48.958
You know? You get left, right, A, B.

37:49.041 --> 37:51.791
You get to skip a level, or you power up.

37:51.875 --> 37:53.375
It's cool, but it's just easy.

37:54.041 --> 37:56.291
I am gonna reinvent the whole idea.

37:56.375 --> 37:59.750
So in my game,
if you wanna cheat, it's gonna cost you.

37:59.833 --> 38:01.666
Like, uh… Like it's gonna hurt.

38:05.416 --> 38:06.375
Am I boring you?

38:07.666 --> 38:08.500
No.

38:10.083 --> 38:11.500
I am. I am boring you.

38:12.958 --> 38:14.083
No, really. It's…

38:14.708 --> 38:16.666
It's good that you're making
something new.

38:17.166 --> 38:18.250
Something that's yours.

38:21.583 --> 38:23.083
Those, um…

38:23.166 --> 38:25.958
Those designs you saw?
Those are just sketches by the way.

38:26.041 --> 38:27.833
Those… They don't mean anything.

38:29.375 --> 38:31.625
I like that you made me look
like a superhero.

38:31.708 --> 38:36.708
Well, gotta make sure
you use your powers wisely.

38:37.708 --> 38:38.666
You're such a dick.

38:38.750 --> 38:41.500
Whoa! Hey, what the fuck was that for?

38:42.000 --> 38:46.083
Do not start a food fight with me.
I am a grand master.

38:46.166 --> 38:47.333
Go. Kayla.

38:47.833 --> 38:50.416
-Ew.
-Sto-- Did I get it in your mouth? Ah!

38:52.583 --> 38:55.208
-Hey, hey! This is our song.

38:55.791 --> 38:56.916
We don't have a song.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.375
What do you mean?
We listened to this, like, four times.

38:59.458 --> 39:01.625
-That doesn't make it our song.

39:02.208 --> 39:04.291
God, do you like anything about me?

39:04.833 --> 39:06.750
♪ And that's the way it is ♪

39:09.833 --> 39:10.916
It's time.

39:11.500 --> 39:12.791
Oh shit. It's time?

39:13.916 --> 39:15.625
-Wait.

39:15.708 --> 39:18.333
-Isaac, hurry up.
-Okay. Oh, there's something.

39:18.958 --> 39:21.166
Uh… Let me…

39:21.250 --> 39:23.416
-Wait. Hold on.

39:23.500 --> 39:26.166
-That is fucking evil.

39:30.458 --> 39:31.541
Oh.

39:31.625 --> 39:35.291
I don't know what that is. What is that?
It's not like anything I've ever seen.

39:35.375 --> 39:37.125
And, like, it's got this weird gap.

39:37.208 --> 39:39.583
If it's coding language,
there should be a cursor.

39:39.666 --> 39:42.541
-Some kind of command prompt?
-There should, but there's nothing.

39:42.625 --> 39:44.666
-Fuck!
-There's nothing--

39:45.458 --> 39:46.916
"Level 3."

39:47.000 --> 39:50.083
"You are with a loyal squire."

39:51.166 --> 39:54.083
A squire?
Have you been talking to this thing?

39:55.416 --> 39:57.875
"Prove yourself worthy of the prize.
Isaac looks…"

40:08.333 --> 40:10.083
How is it doing that?

40:11.625 --> 40:12.625
Ah.

40:12.708 --> 40:13.958
Wha--

40:14.041 --> 40:17.500
It's… It's almost putting the words
on the screen before I say…

40:18.291 --> 40:19.333
them.

40:20.041 --> 40:21.250
-Okay.

40:21.875 --> 40:23.041
Uh…

40:24.416 --> 40:27.875
Well, maybe these symbols
help it interact with reality.

40:27.958 --> 40:29.458
Bad idea.

40:29.541 --> 40:31.583
-"Help? No help?"
-Isaac, be careful.

40:31.666 --> 40:33.125
-It's gonna try hurting you.
-My help?

40:33.208 --> 40:34.833
-We shouldn't play.
-Choose or die?

40:34.916 --> 40:36.083
-Bad idea.
-Gotta choose.

40:36.166 --> 40:38.708
-No, we shouldn't. No, stop. Stop!

40:38.791 --> 40:40.833
-Hey! Oh God!

40:40.916 --> 40:42.708
-What do I do?

40:42.791 --> 40:44.541
Make it stop!

40:50.833 --> 40:52.041
What the fuck was that?

40:56.291 --> 40:57.208
You okay?

41:04.541 --> 41:06.458
Get up. All right.

41:19.250 --> 41:20.083
Oh fuck.

41:22.500 --> 41:24.916
That is some fucked up shit.

41:32.708 --> 41:35.333
I mean, how… How is that even possible?

41:40.625 --> 41:41.750
Blue or red?

41:45.000 --> 41:45.958
Never pick red.

41:47.666 --> 41:48.500
Trust me.

41:58.666 --> 41:59.500
It's locked.

42:05.125 --> 42:06.291
Die.

42:08.500 --> 42:10.708
-What the fuck?
-Well, red's not so bad.

42:17.875 --> 42:18.708
Anything?

42:20.875 --> 42:21.750
It's quiet.

42:44.208 --> 42:46.333
Red's not so bad.
Red's not so bad.

42:47.875 --> 42:49.166
Red's not so bad.

43:34.250 --> 43:36.500
I wanna go swimming.

43:37.041 --> 43:38.833
Kayla. Wait. Wait.

43:38.916 --> 43:41.083
-Kayla.
-I wanna go swimming now.

43:41.791 --> 43:44.375
-Ricky, stop.
-Wait. Kayla.

43:44.875 --> 43:45.750
Ricky!

43:46.333 --> 43:47.750
-Ricky!
-Let's go.

43:48.250 --> 43:50.458
-Let's go.
-Wait.

43:50.541 --> 43:51.916
-Let's go.
-Stop.

43:52.000 --> 43:53.250
-Let's go!
-Wait!

43:53.333 --> 43:55.458
-Kayla. Wait.
-Let's go!

44:02.458 --> 44:04.041
The fuck is this place?

44:05.458 --> 44:06.833
It's where my brother drowned.

44:06.916 --> 44:08.250
I wanna go swimming.

44:11.458 --> 44:13.625
-Ricky.
-No. Kayla, Kayla, remember.

44:13.708 --> 44:15.166
It's not real. It knows you.

44:15.250 --> 44:17.000
Don't… Don't let it play you.

44:17.083 --> 44:18.791
Stop! Ricky!

44:20.166 --> 44:21.875
-Shit.
-Ricky!

44:27.250 --> 44:28.541
-Kayla!

44:29.208 --> 44:31.083
Kayla, Kayla, Kayla. Can you hear me?

44:31.750 --> 44:33.500
Fuck! Fuck!

44:34.000 --> 44:34.833
Come on.

44:35.458 --> 44:37.541
Okay, I'm coming in.

44:39.291 --> 44:40.166
I'm coming in.

44:52.875 --> 44:53.833
Ricky?

44:54.958 --> 44:57.083
Will you look this time?

44:57.666 --> 44:58.791
Where are you?

45:01.291 --> 45:02.291
Fuck.

45:02.375 --> 45:04.250
I can't see shit.

45:07.500 --> 45:08.375
Kayla?

45:11.000 --> 45:12.166
Kayla!

45:12.250 --> 45:13.333
Fuck.

45:13.416 --> 45:14.500
Kayla, say something!

45:16.833 --> 45:17.708
Kayla!

45:18.666 --> 45:19.500
Ricky?

45:20.375 --> 45:22.041
Will you look?

45:23.333 --> 45:24.416
Ricky?

45:27.500 --> 45:29.666
-Isaac.

45:30.291 --> 45:33.250
-Is that you?
-Look at me, Kayla.

45:33.333 --> 45:34.333
Ricky?

45:36.708 --> 45:37.791
Oh fuck!

45:37.875 --> 45:39.250
What are you talking about?

45:39.333 --> 45:43.916
You have to talk in the ear, and then
it will record our voices, okay? Ready?

45:44.000 --> 45:47.250
-You're not… looking.
-You're gonna go swimming in a minute.

45:47.333 --> 45:48.916
Will you look this time?

45:49.000 --> 45:50.791
-Look!

45:53.250 --> 45:54.166
Kayla.

45:59.208 --> 46:00.833
Help! Help!

46:04.041 --> 46:05.250
-Isaac?

46:09.833 --> 46:10.833
Isaac?

46:12.708 --> 46:13.541
Isaac.

46:17.958 --> 46:19.083
-No.

46:28.708 --> 46:29.541
No.

46:50.166 --> 46:52.291
-Please--

46:58.500 --> 46:59.333

He loved the water.

49:26.833 --> 49:29.375
Mom was always working,
so I used to take him swimming.

49:29.458 --> 49:33.000
Well, I say swimming, but he just liked
to splash and play and jump around.

49:33.833 --> 49:35.833
And the one time I looked away…

49:37.583 --> 49:40.000
I don't know why.
It was just for a few seconds.

49:43.625 --> 49:46.041
And when I looked back, he was…

49:46.125 --> 49:47.958
That was it. He was lying face down.

49:49.958 --> 49:51.583
That doesn't make it your fault.

49:52.583 --> 49:54.166
Nobody's ever said it was,

50:46.583 --> 50:50.583
And no, I promise it's not
one of my obscure retro fetishes. Look.

50:52.166 --> 50:55.666
So kids used to play these games
with a dial-up.

50:55.750 --> 50:59.166
Spend a dollar for the first minute,
45 cents for every minute after.

50:59.250 --> 51:01.250
And you choose one or two,

51:02.000 --> 51:03.541
and they could play for hours,

51:03.625 --> 51:07.416
until their parents got, like,
a $500 phone bill.

51:07.500 --> 51:09.000
Then they had to get creative.

51:09.083 --> 51:13.791
And back then, everything was analog,
like, phone routing, sound…

51:13.875 --> 51:16.125
And once they figured out
what the tones meant,

51:17.125 --> 51:20.416
they could hack into the phone lines,
play for free.

51:20.500 --> 51:23.708
And once you're in the phone lines,
then you'd find out anything.

51:25.041 --> 51:25.916
So…

51:28.583 --> 51:30.333
we could try the same hack?

51:30.958 --> 51:33.416
Track the prize line number
using the dial tones?

51:33.500 --> 51:35.833
-I'm already there.

51:41.416 --> 51:42.958
Upstate.

51:44.625 --> 51:46.500
We got ten hours till the next level.

51:47.791 --> 51:48.916
Better get going.

51:52.500 --> 51:55.583
You're doing this 'cause you wanna help me
or you wanna get with me?

51:56.375 --> 51:57.250
Both.

52:02.708 --> 52:04.250
Oh, one more thing.

52:04.916 --> 52:06.875
My car, my music.

52:06.958 --> 52:09.916
-Oh, don't make me listen to your shit.
-No, you love my shit.

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000


52:12.583 --> 52:14.708
Isaac, come on.
Watch where you're going.

52:15.750 --> 52:19.750
-Who taught you to drive?
-I taught myself… mostly.

52:19.833 --> 52:22.833
-Watch out. Watch out.

52:23.541 --> 52:25.166
Slow the fuck down.

52:32.625 --> 52:36.250
-How long till the next level starts?
-About six hours.

53:01.875 --> 53:03.000
Guess we're going in?

53:05.000 --> 53:06.083
You all right?

53:38.250 --> 53:40.750
We gotta find something to bust this open.

53:43.125 --> 53:44.291
That works too.

54:02.875 --> 54:04.041
What now?

54:21.958 --> 54:23.041
Where is that?

54:27.375 --> 54:28.458
It's coming from there.

54:28.541 --> 54:30.125
Greetings.

54:30.625 --> 54:32.708
This is Robert Englund,

54:33.250 --> 54:36.750
horror royalty and Hollywood nightmare.

54:37.750 --> 54:40.083
Or should that be the other way around?

54:41.416 --> 54:45.041
If you're listening to this,
then you're either a loser

54:45.125 --> 54:47.791
who isn't paying
Mommy and Daddy's phone bill,

54:47.875 --> 54:51.916
or you have survived Curs>r.

54:53.666 --> 54:56.791
So, congratulations.

54:56.875 --> 54:59.416
You are worthy.

55:01.291 --> 55:04.083
Enter your four-digit prize code
after the tone.

55:05.000 --> 55:09.833
And remember, reality is cursed.

55:12.041 --> 55:14.375
-Spend that money wise--

55:38.125 --> 55:39.541
Guess we can forget that prize.

55:39.625 --> 55:42.541
There's gotta be something.
There's gotta be.

55:50.958 --> 55:52.000
Hey, hey.

55:53.250 --> 55:54.166
Power cables.

55:56.291 --> 55:58.125
They gotta go somewhere, right?

56:03.125 --> 56:04.083
It goes in here.

56:08.833 --> 56:09.875
Oh shit.

56:11.583 --> 56:12.458
Oh.

56:14.416 --> 56:15.791
Why leave it like this?

56:25.583 --> 56:27.000
They made the game here.

56:46.750 --> 56:47.750
Sorry.

56:59.583 --> 57:01.083
"Curs>r Beta 1."

57:06.000 --> 57:07.666
You promised me food, man.

57:07.750 --> 57:12.750
And we go back,
March 12th, 1984 at- 20 p.m.

57:13.333 --> 57:15.916
This is the first Curs>r beta test.

57:16.000 --> 57:19.875
Since we first discovered the curse,
we've been unable to identify its origins

57:19.958 --> 57:23.166
or translate its exact meaning,

57:23.250 --> 57:26.500
but we know it has unusual properties.

57:27.875 --> 57:31.458
Its symbols seem to affect reality.

57:32.041 --> 57:35.541
Each… Each of them…
Each of them means something.

57:35.625 --> 57:36.500
Fire…

57:38.583 --> 57:39.458
water

57:40.208 --> 57:42.833
and… blood.

57:42.916 --> 57:45.291
Their power
has lain dormant for centuries,

57:45.375 --> 57:46.875
but the myth suggests

57:46.958 --> 57:51.208
whenever they've been used
against a… a person or persons,

57:51.291 --> 57:52.833
they, well, they suffer.

57:52.916 --> 57:53.916
Oh fuck.

57:54.583 --> 57:58.041
Pain, fear, trauma…

57:58.125 --> 58:00.625
And the more the cursed suffer,

58:01.500 --> 58:05.291
the more the curser benefits.

58:05.375 --> 58:09.458
We've converted the original symbols
into 8-bit equivalents,

58:09.541 --> 58:13.750
contained them within
a simple horror game experience,

58:14.250 --> 58:15.083
Choose or Die.

58:15.166 --> 58:16.958
-Choose--
-What the fuck does that mean?

58:17.041 --> 58:20.333
Someo… Someone's been doing this to me?

58:20.416 --> 58:21.958
I will start the test now.

58:28.625 --> 58:29.791
I am the curser.

58:31.875 --> 58:33.333
As I cause suffering…

58:34.458 --> 58:36.291
-I will reap the rewards.

58:39.958 --> 58:41.208
The test has started.

58:42.083 --> 58:44.833
Curs>r. Yeah,
real fucking original, man.

58:46.458 --> 58:47.791
Okay…

58:47.875 --> 58:49.791
"You've been waiting for hours."

58:49.875 --> 58:53.166
"They promised you food, but where is it?"

58:54.166 --> 58:55.500
"Eat the computer?"

58:59.166 --> 59:00.166
"Eat your arm?"

59:02.458 --> 59:03.541
What is this, man?

59:04.166 --> 59:05.375
Just choose one.

59:08.875 --> 59:12.333
-This is bullshit.
-You… You want your money? Hmm?

59:13.125 --> 59:13.958
Choose.

59:14.041 --> 59:17.375
Hey, when this is over, when I get
my money, I'm gonna mess you up.

59:18.166 --> 59:19.041
Arm.

59:27.541 --> 59:28.375
Hey.

59:32.333 --> 59:33.166
Hey.

59:33.750 --> 59:34.916
Watch.

59:44.291 --> 59:46.625
Keep shooting. Get it all.

1:00:05.333 --> 1:00:07.833
It works. It works.

1:00:15.458 --> 1:00:18.833
It's incredible!

1:00:19.416 --> 1:00:20.458
That can't be real.

1:00:21.250 --> 1:00:22.625
Sometimes…

1:00:23.375 --> 1:00:27.416
-Sometimes, a curse can be a gift.

1:00:32.125 --> 1:00:34.083
This bit guy is fucking insane.

1:00:35.125 --> 1:00:37.333
I mean, we gotta tell them.
We gotta tell the police.

1:00:37.416 --> 1:00:38.666
-Or--
-See those?

1:00:38.750 --> 1:00:40.666
The symbol's the command prompt. Isn't it?

1:00:40.750 --> 1:00:42.791
It's the command prompt.
It's what we were missing.

1:00:42.875 --> 1:00:45.000
We gotta get out.
We'll take it back to mine.

1:00:45.083 --> 1:00:46.958
-The fuck?

1:00:48.291 --> 1:00:49.875
-What is that, Kayla?

1:00:49.958 --> 1:00:50.833
What's going on?

1:00:50.916 --> 1:00:53.791
It's too soon. Too fucking soon!

1:00:53.875 --> 1:00:57.083
Level four. You're in 1984.

1:00:57.166 --> 1:00:59.166
We gotta go. Kayla, we gotta go.

1:00:59.250 --> 1:01:02.041
I'm gonna reinvent the whole idea.

1:01:02.625 --> 1:01:05.250
In my game, if you wanna cheat…

1:01:05.333 --> 1:01:06.208
How's he doing that?

1:01:06.291 --> 1:01:07.166
…it's gonna cost you.

1:01:07.250 --> 1:01:08.833
-It knows we cheated.
-Isaac, no.

1:01:08.916 --> 1:01:12.583
-Oh my, it's gonna hurt.

1:01:13.583 --> 1:01:15.541
-What the fuck?

1:01:16.166 --> 1:01:18.625

Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:35.041
I'm sorry.

1:02:55.291 --> 1:02:56.125
You're okay.

1:02:58.083 --> 1:03:00.541
What did we… What did we win?

1:03:01.125 --> 1:03:02.416

You're so fucking smart.

You're okay.

1:03:36.583 --> 1:03:37.916

A player.

Won't you sit down?

1:07:59.958 --> 1:08:01.708

It sent me here.

Why would it do that?

1:08:08.750 --> 1:08:10.000

1:08:19.875 --> 1:08:20.958

1:08:22.958 --> 1:08:23.958
Not exactly.

1:08:28.833 --> 1:08:30.625
I collect things, you know.

I mean, everything's

1:08:41.250 --> 1:08:44.916
So I, uh… I picked up the game

1:08:46.125 --> 1:08:47.583
in a clearance site.

1:08:47.666 --> 1:08:50.333

a couple of minutes, but…

1:08:51.958 --> 1:08:55.000
-But I think I woke it up.

1:08:56.166 --> 1:08:57.541
And then…

1:09:00.625 --> 1:09:02.208
after two levels,

1:09:03.458 --> 1:09:05.458
it promised to leave us alone

1:09:06.458 --> 1:09:08.041
if I made copies.

1:09:11.333 --> 1:09:12.833
My friend is dead.

1:09:18.166 --> 1:09:19.166
I, uh…

1:09:19.708 --> 1:09:21.791
I really am devastated.

1:09:21.875 --> 1:09:23.000
Fuck you.

1:09:26.125 --> 1:09:30.625
If it sent you here,
it can't be for anything good.

1:09:30.708 --> 1:09:32.833
-You bastard!
-You let her go.

1:09:32.916 --> 1:09:37.166
-It's okay… son.

1:09:37.750 --> 1:09:39.541
There's nothing to be afraid of.

1:09:41.708 --> 1:09:42.833
Now, everybody--

1:09:44.083 --> 1:09:47.250
Everybody just sit down.

1:09:55.500 --> 1:09:56.833
You know what I think?

1:09:58.750 --> 1:10:01.375
I think you might be
what it was looking for.

1:10:07.541 --> 1:10:08.666
"Final level."

1:10:09.833 --> 1:10:11.125
"Boss battle."

1:10:13.208 --> 1:10:15.708
It thinks I'm the final level boss

1:10:16.375 --> 1:10:18.166
and you're the hero?

1:10:19.875 --> 1:10:21.458
Oh, that's… that's not fair.

1:10:22.458 --> 1:10:24.208
Aren't guys like me

1:10:24.291 --> 1:10:28.125
allowed to be the fucking hero anymore?

1:10:28.208 --> 1:10:30.583
-You know, in the '80s--
-Fuck the '80s.

1:10:31.166 --> 1:10:34.041
Fuck the '80s?

1:10:35.416 --> 1:10:36.625
You wanna be the hero?

1:10:38.125 --> 1:10:39.458

1:11:50.708 --> 1:11:53.833
You fucking idiot! Shoot me, not her!

1:12:03.875 --> 1:12:05.583
No. No.

1:12:05.666 --> 1:12:06.708
Laura, no!

1:12:08.291 --> 1:12:10.041
No! No!

1:12:13.958 --> 1:12:14.791
Do it.

1:12:17.291 --> 1:12:18.500
Again.

1:12:22.375 --> 1:12:24.833
-Let go, you fucking bitch.

1:12:24.916 --> 1:12:26.000
Fuck you!

1:12:26.583 --> 1:12:28.208
You're gonna fucking pay for this.

1:12:41.250 --> 1:12:42.083
Fu--

1:12:45.541 --> 1:12:47.000
-Fuck.

1:12:47.083 --> 1:12:49.041
-No, Gabe!

1:12:49.541 --> 1:12:50.541
No, Gabe, no, no!

1:13:06.791 --> 1:13:07.791
Yeah. Yeah.

1:13:10.125 --> 1:13:12.333
I'm the fucking hero!

1:14:46.791 --> 1:14:48.000
You were never here.

1:14:49.750 --> 1:14:50.833
Thank you.

1:14:50.916 --> 1:14:52.333
It's the least I can do.

1:14:54.250 --> 1:14:55.583
You saved my life.

1:14:57.750 --> 1:14:59.083
Are you gonna be okay?

1:15:01.791 --> 1:15:02.625
We'll survive.

1:15:18.000 --> 1:15:19.083
What is that?

1:15:20.541 --> 1:15:21.875
It's the real prize.

1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:28.833
Since we first discovered
the curse,

1:15:28.916 --> 1:15:30.583
we've been unable to identify its origins

1:15:30.666 --> 1:15:33.041
or translate its exact meaning,

1:15:33.125 --> 1:15:36.125
but we know it has unusual properties.

1:15:37.375 --> 1:15:40.958
Its symbols seem to affect reality.

1:15:42.250 --> 1:15:46.291
Whenever they've been used
against a person, they suffer.

1:15:47.666 --> 1:15:48.708
-Pain.
-Pain.

1:15:49.708 --> 1:15:50.958
-Fear.
-Fear.

1:15:51.958 --> 1:15:53.375
-Trauma.
-Trauma.

1:15:54.041 --> 1:15:54.875
Death.

1:16:27.666 --> 1:16:29.208
Sure you can.

1:16:44.916 --> 1:16:45.750
The fuck?

1:17:20.166 --> 1:17:23.208
The more
the one who's cursed suffers…

1:17:25.625 --> 1:17:29.666
the more the one
that's proved themself worthy benefits.

1:17:31.541 --> 1:17:33.541
Recovers from sickness.

1:17:36.166 --> 1:17:39.250
Everything wrong in their life made right.

1:17:49.833 --> 1:17:54.750
One life sacrificed
so another can be saved.

1:17:58.666 --> 1:18:01.375
Sometimes, the curse…

1:18:03.333 --> 1:18:04.500
can be a gift.

1:18:06.541 --> 1:18:08.791
I like that you made me look
like a superhero.

1:18:08.875 --> 1:18:11.875
Well, gotta make sure
you use your powers wisely.

1:18:12.375 --> 1:18:13.541
You're such a dick.

1:18:24.166 --> 1:18:25.916
You've suffered.

1:18:27.666 --> 1:18:29.000
I've prospered.

1:18:31.333 --> 1:18:34.083
Yet somehow you managed to beat my game.

1:18:38.041 --> 1:18:38.875
Beck?

1:18:40.791 --> 1:18:41.833
Tell me…

1:18:43.833 --> 1:18:45.625
who will suffer next?

1:18:49.541 --> 1:18:50.958
Only people who deserve it.

1:20:12.250 --> 1:20:17.416
Reality is cursed.

1:20:20.833 --> 1:20:25.375
Remember, reality is the curse.

1:20:31.083 --> 1:20:35.500
Remember, reality is cursed.

1:20:43.041 --> 1:20:47.291
Reality is cursed.

1:20:53.583 --> 1:20:56.958
You are in a dark tower.

1:21:00.500 --> 1:21:02.916
Choose or die.

1:21:07.333 --> 1:21:09.791
Choose or die.

1:21:14.208 --> 1:21:17.541
Choose or die.

1:21:31.333 --> 1:21:34.166
More terror.

1:21:38.208 --> 1:21:42.458
You have survived Curs>r.

1:21:45.083 --> 1:21:47.666
You have survived.

1:21:51.875 --> 1:21:54.416
You are worthy.

1:21:58.833 --> 1:22:01.958
You are worthy.
