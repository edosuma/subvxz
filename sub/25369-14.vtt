00:01.460 --> 00:04.296
[Gwen]
Peter Parker, wherever you are,
I hope you're okay,

00:04.296 --> 00:07.716
'cause this is my fourth call,
not to mention
the million texts I sent you.

00:07.716 --> 00:11.678
The Science Administration
just arrived to drop off
the Blood Gem,

00:11.678 --> 00:15.349
which you promised
to help me study with Horizon's
proprietary particle scanner.

00:15.349 --> 00:18.268
So whatever you're doing,
please stop doing it,
and call me!

00:18.268 --> 00:20.187
[beeps]
Hi there.

00:22.523 --> 00:25.108
Delivery manifest lists
two people picking up.

00:25.108 --> 00:26.735
Your friend flake on ya?

00:26.735 --> 00:28.528
[sighs]
No.

00:28.528 --> 00:31.657
It looks like all my friends
have more exciting things to do.

00:31.657 --> 00:34.952
I can handle this
on my own.
[sighs]

00:37.746 --> 00:40.165
[panting]

00:40.165 --> 00:42.084
I'll take high,
you take low.

00:42.084 --> 00:44.253
[grunting]

00:44.253 --> 00:47.839
Now, why would you want this,
Mr. Purse‐Snatcher?

00:47.839 --> 00:50.217
It seriously doesn't
match your look.

00:50.217 --> 00:51.969
[chuckles]
Banter.

00:51.969 --> 00:53.804
That's something Spider‐Man
taught me.

00:53.804 --> 00:56.181
He taught you
to not be funny? Huh.

00:56.181 --> 00:58.183
[muffled grunting]
He also taught me

00:58.183 --> 01:00.602
words can hurt
just as much as punches.

01:00.602 --> 01:03.730
How can you joke
when fighting crime
is so serious?

01:03.730 --> 01:06.024
According to Spidey,
it distracts the bad guys

01:06.024 --> 01:07.859
and makes the people you rescue
feel safe.

01:07.859 --> 01:09.903
[scoffs]
Where is Spider‐Man anyway?

01:09.903 --> 01:12.406
Wasn't he gonna help train me
how to use these powers too?

01:12.406 --> 01:13.907
[scoffs]
Please!

01:13.907 --> 01:16.076
I can Spider‐coach you
just as well as he could.

01:16.076 --> 01:19.329
He's probably off doing,
like, Avenger‐level stuff
or something.

01:21.081 --> 01:23.417
What?

01:23.417 --> 01:25.544
You have notes to the police
already written?

01:25.544 --> 01:27.713
Of course.
I'm always prepared.

01:27.713 --> 01:30.132
It's my other superpower!

01:30.132 --> 01:32.217
Okay, this is my last call,
Peter.

01:32.217 --> 01:35.220
The Blood Gem's in my lap,
and if I make
any real headway

01:35.220 --> 01:37.306
on its alleged
mystical properties,

01:37.306 --> 01:40.642
the glory of the discovery
is 100% going to me.

01:40.642 --> 01:43.020
Cool? Cool. See ya.

01:43.020 --> 01:45.230
[beeps]

01:45.230 --> 01:47.399
[chuckles]
"Spider‐Gwen."

01:47.399 --> 01:50.277
Sounds funny now,
doesn't it?

01:50.277 --> 01:52.237
But it sure was fun.

01:52.237 --> 01:55.449
But that was then.
Now I'm just going
to devote myself

01:55.449 --> 01:58.285
to world‐changing,
scientific breakthroughs.

01:58.285 --> 02:00.787
No superpowers,
no super‐villains.

02:00.787 --> 02:04.124
Who needs that kind
of excitement in your life
when you've got this?

02:04.124 --> 02:06.251
[yells]
[evil laughter]

02:11.298 --> 02:16.261
Scuse me, miss,
but I think you have
something I need.

02:16.261 --> 02:17.095
[grunts]
[Gwen screams]

02:28.899 --> 02:30.734
[yells]
[grunts]

02:31.818 --> 02:34.029
Scorpion?!
What do you want?

02:34.029 --> 02:36.198
How do you know who I am?

02:36.198 --> 02:39.159
You realize you're dressed
like a giant scorpion, right?

02:39.159 --> 02:42.162
And Spider‐Man taking you down
was all over the news last year?

02:42.162 --> 02:43.997
Don't mention the bug!

02:43.997 --> 02:46.833
Look, this doesn't
have to get messy.

02:46.833 --> 02:48.877
Just give me
that Blood Gem.

02:48.877 --> 02:52.631
You think I'm gonna
let a criminal take an item
of unknown power?

02:52.631 --> 02:55.467
Yeah. 'Cause how
you gonna stop me?

02:56.968 --> 02:58.970
Ooh, a microscope!

02:58.970 --> 03:00.847
How scary.
Now step aside!

03:00.847 --> 03:02.974
You first!
Ow!
[groans]

03:02.974 --> 03:04.643
[grunts]

03:04.643 --> 03:07.062
Gwen, get out of here.
We'll handle him.

03:07.062 --> 03:09.981
I'm not running away.
We took down the Spot together.

03:09.981 --> 03:12.651
I can help!
Help by getting to safety.

03:12.651 --> 03:15.320
Let the superheroes
handle this.

03:15.320 --> 03:17.739
I got a better idea.
[grunts]

03:20.283 --> 03:23.245
[grunts, yells]

03:23.245 --> 03:26.748
[both yell, grunt]

03:26.748 --> 03:29.084
[grunts]
Hero Lesson 52:

03:29.084 --> 03:31.253
Agility beats strength!

03:31.253 --> 03:32.587
[yells]

03:32.587 --> 03:34.798
[grunts]
But tails beats everything.

03:34.798 --> 03:38.927
I'm not sure about your lessons.
[yelling]

03:38.927 --> 03:40.262
[grunts]
[grunts]

03:40.262 --> 03:41.888
[grunts]

03:41.888 --> 03:44.349
I've fought the real
Spider‐Man, kiddos.

03:44.349 --> 03:46.435
You ain't him!

03:48.145 --> 03:50.021
[panting]

03:50.021 --> 03:53.191
Gotta find a place to hide this.

03:53.191 --> 03:55.193
This is either brilliant,

03:55.193 --> 03:57.779
or I'm gonna have to buy
a new phone.

03:58.780 --> 04:00.615
I'm done playing games!

04:00.615 --> 04:01.741
[growls]

04:01.741 --> 04:04.077
[grunts, yells]

04:04.077 --> 04:06.455
[Gwen grunts]

04:06.455 --> 04:08.039
Huh?
[grunts]

04:10.917 --> 04:12.544
See ya!
[laughs]

04:12.544 --> 04:14.838
[groans]
I'm guessing Scorpion
came this way.

04:14.838 --> 04:16.423
Gwen! Are you okay?

04:16.423 --> 04:19.259
Yeesh!
Why can't anyone
ever use a door?

04:19.259 --> 04:22.095
I‐‐ I'm fine,
but Scorpion took
the Blood Gem.

04:22.095 --> 04:24.931
What's a Blood Gem?
The Science Administration

04:24.931 --> 04:26.933
found it in an ancient
dig site last year.

04:26.933 --> 04:28.852
It supposedly gives off
strange energy.

04:28.852 --> 04:31.062
But they needed our scanner
to test it.

04:31.062 --> 04:34.232
So whatever
Scorpion wants it for,
it can't be good.

04:34.232 --> 04:36.234
But I think I know‐‐
Strange energy.

04:36.234 --> 04:38.445
Bad news. Got it.
Wait. There's‐‐

04:38.445 --> 04:40.447
Gwen, I love
that you wanna help,

04:40.447 --> 04:42.783
but you can't fight
villains like that
without powers.

04:42.783 --> 04:44.951
But I don't need powers,
because‐‐

04:44.951 --> 04:46.953
I just don't want you
to get hurt.

04:48.955 --> 04:50.499
Fine.

04:50.499 --> 04:52.417
Don't wanna listen to me?

04:52.417 --> 04:54.795
I'll handle this myself.

04:54.795 --> 04:58.465
Bet no one's ever used
a phone‐finder program
to track a super‐villain before.

04:58.465 --> 05:01.885
Gwen for the win.

05:01.885 --> 05:04.513
[Miles]
It looked like Scorpion
headed north from Horizon,

05:04.513 --> 05:06.264
so let's keep
that direction.

05:06.264 --> 05:07.682
So, we're just
winging it?

05:07.682 --> 05:10.435
We should invent
a Spider‐Tracer or something.

05:10.435 --> 05:13.021
Yeah, Spider‐Man already did,

05:13.021 --> 05:15.774
but I kind of forgot
to bring 'em with me.

05:15.774 --> 05:18.360
Wow. No offense, Miles,
but you're not exactly

05:18.360 --> 05:20.821
the most prepared
superhero coach, are you?

05:20.821 --> 05:23.698
Yeah. Okay. Maybe Spidey
would've been better at this.

05:23.698 --> 05:25.325
But at least I'm here.

05:41.258 --> 05:44.219
This is useless.
We can't just
wander the city

05:44.219 --> 05:46.930
looking for random clues
where Scorpion went.

05:46.930 --> 05:49.599
Okay. Let me check
police scanners
and social media,

05:49.599 --> 05:51.434
see if there's
any sign of him.
[beeping]

05:51.434 --> 05:52.978
But first...

05:52.978 --> 05:55.146
Hello, Mrs. Parker?

05:55.146 --> 05:57.899
Hey, it's Miles.
Is Pete home?

05:59.609 --> 06:01.695
Yeah, I'll check
the lab at school.

06:01.695 --> 06:04.447
I'm sure
he's just working late.

06:04.447 --> 06:07.826
Except that he's not.
Spidey, where are you?

06:12.289 --> 06:14.708
[Tinkerer]
It looks like your mission
was a success.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.459
Delightful!

06:16.459 --> 06:19.462
That gem‐tracker thingy
you whipped up worked great.

06:19.462 --> 06:22.090
Of course,
had to do a little bashing.

06:22.090 --> 06:24.134
[Tinkerer]
I'm sure.

06:24.134 --> 06:26.761
That's why this partnership
works so well.

06:26.761 --> 06:29.848
My brains
and your brute strength.

06:29.848 --> 06:33.602
Heh.
Which is about to become
strengthier, right?

06:33.602 --> 06:37.230
If "strengthier"
was a word, yes.

06:37.230 --> 06:41.401
I've heard legends
of the Blood Gem since before
you and I bonded

06:41.401 --> 06:43.653
over our hatred
of Spider‐Man.

06:43.653 --> 06:46.573
Its properties haven't
been completely tested.

06:46.573 --> 06:49.534
But based on what I've read,
if I can harness

06:49.534 --> 06:52.078
even a sliver
of its alleged energy,

06:52.078 --> 06:56.583
you'll find yourself
more powerful
than you could ever dream.

06:56.583 --> 06:58.793
I can dream big, Tinkerer.

06:58.793 --> 07:00.879
Big enough
to take down the bug!

07:00.879 --> 07:02.881
Oh, trust me,

07:02.881 --> 07:07.052
Spider‐Man will be no match
for the combined might

07:07.052 --> 07:10.639
of the new and improved
Tinkerer and Scorpion.

07:10.639 --> 07:13.475
"Scorpion and Tinkerer,"
you mean.

07:13.475 --> 07:18.271
The two names
that Spider‐Man will regret
ever sending to prison.

07:21.941 --> 07:23.652
What is this?

07:25.862 --> 07:28.782
Gotta belong to the girl
I yanked this from at Horizon.

07:28.782 --> 07:31.201
Well, she'll be
missing some texts.

07:31.201 --> 07:32.827
You moron!

07:32.827 --> 07:35.872
Someone could use this phone
to track us. Destroy it.

07:35.872 --> 07:38.166
[yells]

07:38.166 --> 07:41.002
Hurry this up!
I'm getting impatient!

07:43.755 --> 07:45.423
That was brand new.

07:45.423 --> 07:49.511
Okay, this is out of my league.
Time to call the big guns.

07:50.512 --> 07:51.763
[chirps]

07:51.763 --> 07:54.140
[Tinkerer]
It's working.

07:55.850 --> 07:58.269
Except I'm out of time.
[beeps]

07:58.269 --> 08:01.231
What are you waiting for?
Power me up!

08:01.231 --> 08:04.943
Our revenge on Spider‐Man
can't wait another second.

08:04.943 --> 08:08.947
Infusing your cells with
an untold mystical energy

08:08.947 --> 08:12.283
isn't like using
a common hair dryer.

08:12.283 --> 08:15.120
I must calibrate
the settings.

08:15.120 --> 08:16.788
Huh?

08:16.788 --> 08:18.331
[grunts]

08:18.331 --> 08:20.333
An interloper!

08:20.333 --> 08:22.293
The girl from the lab!

08:22.293 --> 08:24.379
Uh...

08:24.379 --> 08:26.840
[grunts]
[grunts]

08:29.759 --> 08:31.928
[yells, grunts]

08:31.928 --> 08:32.929
[groans]

08:37.517 --> 08:40.270
What‐‐ What happened to me?

08:40.270 --> 08:42.313
[growls]
Nothing happened to you!

08:42.313 --> 08:44.149
Hmm?
[grunts]

08:44.149 --> 08:46.484
Brilliant plan, genius.

08:46.484 --> 08:49.112
Your power‐up doohickey
doesn't work.

08:49.112 --> 08:51.489
This girl didn't
power up or nothing.

08:51.489 --> 08:54.492
I told you I had to
calibrate the settings.

08:54.492 --> 08:56.244
If this partnership's
going to work,

08:56.244 --> 08:58.496
you need to seriously consider
going to anger management.

08:58.496 --> 09:00.498
Hey, where are you
sneaking off to?

09:00.498 --> 09:02.876
[grunts]
[grunts]

09:02.876 --> 09:05.170
You've seen too much, girl.
[grunts]

09:05.170 --> 09:07.297
You ain't getting
out of here.
[grunts]

09:09.507 --> 09:11.217
[pants, grunts]

09:11.217 --> 09:15.847
Wha‐‐ My spider powers
are back?

09:15.847 --> 09:18.683
She couldn't
do that before.

09:18.683 --> 09:22.062
Hmm. Someone owes me
an apology.

09:22.062 --> 09:24.230
Your doohickey
really worked!

09:24.230 --> 09:27.233
You gotta blast me with the‐‐
[grunting]

09:27.233 --> 09:30.612
Oh, I missed having these.

09:30.612 --> 09:33.406
[grunts]
Ouch!

09:33.406 --> 09:35.033
[yells]
[cries out]

09:35.033 --> 09:36.409
[grunts]

09:36.409 --> 09:37.577
[grunts]
Aah!

09:37.577 --> 09:40.038
Ha! If you guys
are done with this,

09:40.038 --> 09:41.748
I think I'll just
take it with me.

09:41.748 --> 09:43.917
[grunts]

09:43.917 --> 09:47.087
[grunts, groans]

09:47.087 --> 09:50.215
I've got it!
Now, let's not get
ahead of ourselves.

09:50.215 --> 09:52.550
[pants, grunts]

09:52.550 --> 09:56.054
Just like riding a bicycle.
Take that, Anya.

09:57.555 --> 09:59.724
Huh?

09:59.724 --> 10:01.101
[yells]

10:01.101 --> 10:02.727
[grunts]

10:03.770 --> 10:06.648
[grunts]
Whoa. Okay.

10:06.648 --> 10:09.400
I can kind of
glide now, too?

10:09.400 --> 10:11.402
This just keeps
getting better.

10:12.445 --> 10:14.823
[grunts]
See ya.

10:14.823 --> 10:16.783
[growling]

10:19.285 --> 10:21.287
[Anya]
Excuse us.
[Miles]
Sorry.

10:21.287 --> 10:24.791
How is a giant Scorpion dude
so hard to spot?

10:24.791 --> 10:27.252
[sighs]
We should've gotten Gwen's help.

10:27.252 --> 10:30.463
With her expertise
on the Blood Gem, she could
maybe track it or something.

10:30.463 --> 10:33.258
'Cause it's not like Scorpion's
just gonna head our way.

10:33.258 --> 10:36.136
Heads up! Scorpion's
headed your way!

10:36.136 --> 10:37.470
[Scorpion grunting]

10:37.470 --> 10:39.430
[tires screech]
[yells]

10:39.430 --> 10:41.474
Bring that back!

10:41.474 --> 10:42.934
[whimpering]

10:42.934 --> 10:44.978
I have so many
questions right now.

10:44.978 --> 10:47.856
[yells]

10:47.856 --> 10:50.525
Guys, Scorpion trap!
Lock him in!

10:50.525 --> 10:53.778
[grunting]

10:55.780 --> 10:57.782
[straining]

11:02.745 --> 11:05.248
[yells]

11:05.248 --> 11:08.084
You can't stop me!

11:09.377 --> 11:11.588
I don't know
if that's gonna hold.

11:12.881 --> 11:16.092
Then just to be sure...

11:17.135 --> 11:18.761
[yells]

11:19.762 --> 11:21.681
[groans]

11:23.141 --> 11:25.059
[grunts]

11:25.059 --> 11:26.561
[chuckles]

11:26.561 --> 11:29.772
High fives all around
for the Spider Team!

11:31.566 --> 11:32.859
How...

11:32.859 --> 11:35.695
Funny you should ask.
So, the Tinkerer‐‐

11:35.695 --> 11:37.488
You fought
the Tinkerer too?

11:37.488 --> 11:39.490
Who now?
Don't be
so surprised.

11:39.490 --> 11:42.660
Remember, during Spider Island,
I had powers way before you did.

11:42.660 --> 11:44.204
Like, two days before.

11:44.204 --> 11:47.332
And I had powers
way before both of you.

11:47.332 --> 11:50.877
But that's not helping me
understand what happened to you.

11:50.877 --> 11:54.547
Well, the Tinkerer
created this to harness power
from the Blood Gem.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.883
Based on my preliminary scans
back in my lab,

11:56.883 --> 11:59.636
it had some sort of
transformative powers,

11:59.636 --> 12:03.264
and somehow they triggered
my spider‐powers to come back.

12:03.264 --> 12:05.767
Are you okay with that?

12:05.767 --> 12:09.604
Guys, I've missed having
these powers every day.

12:09.604 --> 12:11.898
And watching you two
swinging through the city‐‐

12:11.898 --> 12:13.691
It's not all fun and games.

12:13.691 --> 12:16.069
I didn't say it was.

12:16.069 --> 12:18.029
[straining]

12:18.029 --> 12:19.989
Shh!
We gotta get
to the police station

12:19.989 --> 12:22.158
and take them
to the Tinkerer's lab.

12:22.158 --> 12:25.161
Anyone have paper?
So we can leave a note.

12:26.871 --> 12:29.707
Whoo‐hoo!

12:29.707 --> 12:33.169
Gwen, we're not
at a playground here.
This is serious!

12:33.169 --> 12:35.797
Lighten up, Anya.

12:37.674 --> 12:41.052
I'm back!
Which is great.
Don't get me wrong.

12:41.052 --> 12:44.013
But you don't see me
cheering for myself
every time I shoot a web.

12:44.013 --> 12:47.225
Because you never lost
your powers like I did.

12:47.225 --> 12:50.478
Imagine it. One day,
you're swinging over the city,

12:50.478 --> 12:53.773
and the next day,
that's all gone.

12:53.773 --> 12:57.068
Now, let's get to
the police station before
the Tinkerer leaves his lab.

12:58.403 --> 13:00.280

"your Friendly Neighborhood

Spiders!

13:04.826 --> 13:06.119
[officers yell]

13:06.119 --> 13:08.663
I'm through playing around.

13:10.331 --> 13:11.958
The station's just
right up here.

13:16.129 --> 13:18.131
[Tinkerer]
Sneak attack!

13:18.131 --> 13:21.801
I wouldn't be surprised
if you did not recognize me.

13:21.801 --> 13:26.139
You're the Tinkerer...
in a robot suit.

13:26.139 --> 13:29.434
Well, it's not fair
for you to answer.
You just fought me.

13:29.434 --> 13:31.769
Did the rest of you
recognize me?

13:31.769 --> 13:35.315
Oh, so this is
that Tickler guy
you were talking about?

13:35.315 --> 13:37.859
Mm! It's "Tinkerer"!

13:37.859 --> 13:39.819
I'm famous.

13:39.819 --> 13:41.654
[all grunt]

13:48.411 --> 13:49.829
[gasps]

13:49.829 --> 13:54.333
And ha! My banter
was only a distraction.

13:54.333 --> 13:57.128
Clever! Now prepare
for real power.

13:57.128 --> 14:00.715
I'm not an evil mastermind,
but making us more powerful

14:00.715 --> 14:03.092
probably isn't
a winning plan for you.

14:03.092 --> 14:06.596
Ha! I'm not blasting you.

14:07.722 --> 14:11.934
[grunts, laughs]

14:11.934 --> 14:13.686
Finally.

14:18.232 --> 14:20.234
[evil laughter]

14:22.528 --> 14:26.032
Now, this... is power!

14:26.032 --> 14:29.035
[yells]

14:29.035 --> 14:31.037
Tell me one of you
has Spider‐Man
on speed dial.

14:34.957 --> 14:38.836
[grunts]

14:38.836 --> 14:40.963
Are you sure
you missed all this?

14:40.963 --> 14:42.590
Well, not
this part exactly.

14:42.590 --> 14:43.966
[Scorpion yells]
[grunts]

14:46.344 --> 14:47.303
Gwen!

14:47.303 --> 14:48.930
Hey! Don't ignore me.

14:48.930 --> 14:51.182
I can kick your butt too.

14:51.182 --> 14:53.684
Are you okay?
[grunts]

14:53.684 --> 14:55.770
Of course.
Spider strength.

14:55.770 --> 14:58.272
[both grunt]

15:04.862 --> 15:05.947
[grunts]

15:05.947 --> 15:08.116
Nope!

15:08.116 --> 15:11.244
Let's see Spider‐Man
ignore this.

15:11.244 --> 15:14.747
That web‐head shows up
any time we appear on the scene.

15:14.747 --> 15:17.625
Well, this time we're ready!

15:17.625 --> 15:21.587
Yes! It's time
for his final round

15:21.587 --> 15:23.881
with the Tinkerer and Scorpion.

15:24.882 --> 15:27.260
Scorpion and Tinkerer!

15:27.260 --> 15:29.095
You two need to agree
on your branding.

15:29.095 --> 15:31.556

15:31.556 --> 15:32.598
[grunts]

15:32.598 --> 15:35.601
[whimpers]

15:35.601 --> 15:40.273
Is all of this really just
to get Spider‐Man's attention?
Ever hear of e‐mail?

15:40.273 --> 15:42.275
Do not mock me.

15:42.275 --> 15:45.153
Spider‐Man probably doesn't
even have an e‐mail address.

15:45.153 --> 15:46.779
[grunts]
Sure he does.

15:46.779 --> 15:49.323
It's on the World Wide Web.

15:49.323 --> 15:50.491
[grunts]

15:50.491 --> 15:52.326
[gasps]
[thud]

15:52.326 --> 15:53.911
He thinks
he's good at banter.

15:57.415 --> 16:01.127
[yells, grunts]

16:01.127 --> 16:05.715
What's Spider‐Man got to do
that's more important
than stopping us?

16:05.715 --> 16:07.133
[growls]

16:07.133 --> 16:10.428
[grunting]

16:10.428 --> 16:14.682
[Tinkerer grunts]
Taste delicious defeat, kid!

16:14.682 --> 16:17.101
"Kid"?
Hey!

16:17.101 --> 16:18.895
Just gotta borrow this
for a second.

16:18.895 --> 16:21.898
What? Give that‐‐
[grunts]

16:21.898 --> 16:24.859
No one calls me "kid"!

16:24.859 --> 16:27.987
There's gotta be a way
to reverse what the Blood Gem
did to Scorpion.

16:27.987 --> 16:30.489
Maybe alter
the polarity on this?

16:30.489 --> 16:32.325
Check the amp
fluctuations.

16:32.325 --> 16:34.327
All hardwired, no access.

16:34.327 --> 16:36.037
[growls]

16:38.164 --> 16:41.209
Man, I missed this.
Fighting for our lives?

16:41.209 --> 16:42.627
No. Us.

16:42.627 --> 16:44.629
It wasn't just
my powers I missed.

16:44.629 --> 16:46.631
You and Miles have been off,
doing your spider things,

16:46.631 --> 16:48.633
and I was the only one left out.

16:48.633 --> 16:50.468
I missed... you.

16:50.468 --> 16:53.512
Well, I'd say you're back in
pretty seriously now.

16:54.555 --> 16:55.848

16:55.848 --> 16:58.893

you wish for!

17:06.525 --> 17:08.945
[growls]
Okay,

17:08.945 --> 17:11.197
the lesson was
agility beats strength.

17:11.197 --> 17:13.532
Let's see if it's true!
[yells]
[cries out]

17:13.532 --> 17:15.868
True!

17:15.868 --> 17:19.038
[Scorpion yelling]

17:19.038 --> 17:20.039
What?

17:20.039 --> 17:22.041
Am I doing something to it?

17:22.041 --> 17:24.794
You're not taking that, girl!

17:24.794 --> 17:28.089
That's my power source!

17:38.099 --> 17:39.976
That wasn't my fault!

17:39.976 --> 17:41.811
Oh, yeah.
[chuckles]
Heads up!

17:44.188 --> 17:45.189
[cries out]

17:51.737 --> 17:54.740
Why does that thing glow
every time you two touch it?

17:54.740 --> 17:58.578
Scorpion actually said
something smart.
His "power source."

17:58.578 --> 18:02.164
Maybe this thing's
like a battery.
It's generating our powers.

18:02.164 --> 18:05.459
But what about the "let's drain
Scorpion's powers" plan?
[grunts]

18:06.586 --> 18:09.213

18:11.048 --> 18:12.925

18:12.925 --> 18:16.387
There's just not a feasible way
to reverse this. Come on.

18:16.387 --> 18:20.057
[yells]
[angry grunt]

18:20.057 --> 18:23.102
[Scorpion grunts]
[grunts]
Wonderful.

18:23.102 --> 18:25.271
Now we're doing this
live on TV.

18:25.271 --> 18:27.607
Perfect.

18:27.607 --> 18:31.277
There's no way Spider‐Man
won't see this now.

18:31.277 --> 18:32.945

18:38.618 --> 18:41.996
Spider‐Man,
wherever you are,

18:41.996 --> 18:45.458
you have one minute
to show your face,
[straining continues]

18:45.458 --> 18:48.336
or I'll destroy
your little assistant here!

18:48.336 --> 18:49.754
"Assistant"?

18:49.754 --> 18:52.131
Show yourself!

18:52.131 --> 18:54.008
No! Let her‐‐

18:55.134 --> 18:57.136
You're next!

18:57.136 --> 19:00.431
[grunts]
I can't reverse this device.

19:00.431 --> 19:02.266
But I think
there's another way.

19:09.315 --> 19:11.359
What are you doing?

19:11.359 --> 19:14.779
If this thing's like a battery
for Scorpion's powers,

19:14.779 --> 19:16.864
then I need
to destroy the battery.

19:16.864 --> 19:19.033
But that would take away
your powers too.

19:19.033 --> 19:20.826
[straining]

19:21.827 --> 19:23.454
[grunts]

19:23.454 --> 19:26.749
This was never
really about powers.

The explosion‐‐
She has to
be here somewhere.

19:59.240 --> 20:02.076
Oh, come on, Gwen.

20:02.076 --> 20:04.995
[Gwen]
Wow. Nice to see
you guys care so much.

20:04.995 --> 20:06.997

20:06.997 --> 20:08.999
You're alive!

20:08.999 --> 20:10.668
Either that
or I'm a ghost.

20:10.668 --> 20:13.921
Ooh, how does that sound‐‐
"Ghost‐Spider"?

20:13.921 --> 20:16.465
Creepy
but kind of awesome.

20:16.465 --> 20:18.467
Weren't you supposed
to lose your powers?

20:18.467 --> 20:22.430
Right? Maybe being directly
at the gem's blast point,

20:22.430 --> 20:24.515
I absorbed a massive amount
of its energy,

20:24.515 --> 20:26.976
reenergizing my dormant powers?

20:26.976 --> 20:30.271
So, you're thinking
you became
your own power source?

20:30.271 --> 20:31.689
Intense.

20:31.689 --> 20:34.442
I'll definitely
have to study this.

20:34.442 --> 20:36.819
But, guys,
I can't believe it.

20:36.819 --> 20:39.155
Giant fight with super‐villains
in New York,

20:39.155 --> 20:41.282
and we were the ones
who took them down.

20:41.282 --> 20:43.284
We had to.

20:43.284 --> 20:45.286
I mean, Spider‐Man
never showed.

20:45.286 --> 20:47.288
Even after Scorpion
called him out.

20:47.288 --> 20:50.541
And that's weird, right?
Even for Spider‐Man.

20:50.541 --> 20:53.627
Yeah. Very weird.

20:58.924 --> 21:00.926
[quiet chatter]

21:00.926 --> 21:03.554
I think we need to apply
Planck's constant here to‐‐

21:24.909 --> 21:27.745
[girls whooping]

Okay, final lesson.

21:27.745 --> 21:30.623
We're only strengthened
when we surround ourselves

21:30.623 --> 21:32.291
You got that right!
