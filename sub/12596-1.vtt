get Lowry for drugs or human trafficking,

- we close the case on Danny's murder.
- My office is sympathetic, Detective,

we need more.

with everything that happened

you really think Danny would
come back home and face the music?

19:31.629 --> 19:33.798
[Little Jake] That trailer,
you can get seven, eight bucks for it.

19:33.881 --> 19:37.051
[laughs] Yeah, you're right.
Fucking A, that was a dumb idea.

19:37.134 --> 19:38.494
You keeping your mind right, boss?

19:40.930 --> 19:43.557
My mind? Yeah, I'm good.

19:44.892 --> 19:47.478
Well, you still moving forward
with the new marina?

19:47.561 --> 19:50.064
- How's that going, everything kosher?
- It will be.

19:51.399 --> 19:52.399
How?

19:53.192 --> 19:54.985
Ever since your brother died, you've...

19:57.905 --> 19:58.905
I've been what?

20:01.575 --> 20:02.575
Look...

20:03.953 --> 20:05.830
I get it. I feel bad, I really do.

20:05.913 --> 20:07.498
But ever since then
you've been losing focus.

20:07.581 --> 20:09.458
- We've been losing accounts.
- Jake...

20:09.542 --> 20:11.377
- Now, if you can't do the job...
- Jake...

20:11.460 --> 20:14.338
Look, if you can't do the job,
if you need some more time,

20:14.422 --> 20:16.924
- then bring someone else in here.
- Okay.

20:17.508 --> 20:18.676
Look at you, your mind ain't in it.

20:18.759 --> 20:21.887
Listen, man,
I thank you for talking to me.

20:22.596 --> 20:25.433
But I'm trying to build an empire here,
you know?

20:25.725 --> 20:27.727
And I'm not gonna forget
you little people.

20:28.477 --> 20:29.770
[chuckles]

20:30.438 --> 20:32.857
Relax, you'll get paid.

20:34.400 --> 20:36.402
[♪♪♪]

20:41.532 --> 20:44.118
You haven't spoken to the boy again,
have you?

20:44.452 --> 20:45.870
[Potts] No, not yet.

20:46.787 --> 20:48.330
Haven't been able to find him.

20:51.834 --> 20:53.669
The kids are coming for dinner tonight.

20:54.128 --> 20:57.256
John is supposed to update us
on the investigation.

21:06.015 --> 21:08.058
What you told me, about...

21:10.144 --> 21:12.521
what you found in Miami...

21:14.690 --> 21:16.066
[sighs]

21:17.610 --> 21:18.610
Yeah?

21:20.070 --> 21:21.781
It's a lot to process.

21:24.074 --> 21:25.326
I'm sure it is.

21:26.911 --> 21:30.206
John lied to me, I get that. I just...

21:31.665 --> 21:32.665
[sighs]

21:32.917 --> 21:34.794
I just can't figure out why.

21:37.505 --> 21:40.341
Would you like for me
to try and find out?

21:45.054 --> 21:46.764
Well, listen, I appreciate you

21:46.847 --> 21:49.558
- letting me in on the briefings.
- You deserve to be in the loop.

21:49.809 --> 21:51.393
Mm.

21:52.228 --> 21:55.523
I hear you're throwing your hat
in the ring for my job.

21:56.023 --> 21:58.609
Is that true? You wanna be sheriff?

21:59.860 --> 22:02.363
Shit, Frank,
do I look like a politician to you?

22:02.780 --> 22:05.783
Well, that's an evasive
non-response response, so, yeah,

22:05.866 --> 22:07.284
I guess you do.

22:10.079 --> 22:12.039
You know,
I thought I had this thing sewn up.

22:12.748 --> 22:14.124
Who's gonna oppose me?

22:15.084 --> 22:16.710
Plekanic is a fucking cowboy.

22:17.253 --> 22:20.381
Davis is a glorified paper-pusher.
But you?

22:23.467 --> 22:24.760
You make me nervous.

22:28.514 --> 22:30.599
Franco,
I haven't decided on anything yet.

22:31.725 --> 22:34.853
I like you, John.
We've known each other for a long time.

22:34.937 --> 22:38.482
But this job is a lot more complicated
than putting away bad guys.

22:38.566 --> 22:42.570
- I think I understand that.
- No, you don't. How could you?

22:48.534 --> 22:49.827
I'll tell you this as a friend.

22:51.161 --> 22:54.373
If you run, I will stomp your ass.

22:54.582 --> 22:56.584
[both laugh]

22:58.335 --> 22:59.335
All right.

23:03.924 --> 23:04.924
Hey.

23:06.343 --> 23:07.761
I'm sorry about your brother.

23:08.887 --> 23:11.807
I wish I could do more,
but the feds are running this.

23:35.539 --> 23:37.541
[Janey] Who do you know that does that?
[Nolan] Oh, boy. What?

23:37.625 --> 23:38.625
[Janey] Who does that?

23:38.709 --> 23:42.713
[Nolan] I've seen guys, you know,
gotten the leaves and it's all...

23:42.796 --> 23:44.048
Janey.

23:45.257 --> 23:46.675
You need to get ready for dinner.

23:46.925 --> 23:48.594
I'm just hanging out.

23:48.677 --> 23:51.877
But I don't wanna be late for Grandma's.
You need to go and get ready for dinner.

23:54.933 --> 23:56.143
- I'll finish that later.
- Yeah.

23:56.226 --> 23:57.853
- Thank you.
- Whatever.

24:13.369 --> 24:14.969
Your mother's a very hard woman to find.

24:15.496 --> 24:16.705
Well, when you spend
your life running

24:16.789 --> 24:19.083
from collection agencies
you get good at that.

24:20.542 --> 24:21.542
Yeah.

24:26.382 --> 24:27.758
You asked me
what I want from you.

24:30.886 --> 24:32.137
Mm-hm.

24:33.472 --> 24:34.472
That's right.

24:37.184 --> 24:38.686
I guess, mainly...

24:42.106 --> 24:43.607
I just wanted to meet you.

24:44.400 --> 24:46.860
See if the Rayburns
were actually real...

24:47.820 --> 24:50.364
or if they were just another lie
my dad told me.

24:52.533 --> 24:56.120
You can't just come into people's lives
and expect them to embrace you,

24:56.662 --> 24:59.206
especially when they know
so very little about you.

24:59.289 --> 25:02.710
Look, bro,
I haven't talked to my mom in a year.

25:02.793 --> 25:05.421
I don't know where she's living,
or if she's living.

25:06.714 --> 25:09.133
A few months ago my dad got
in touch with me...

25:10.300 --> 25:11.802
started sending me money.

25:14.680 --> 25:16.181
Sending you money where?

25:16.807 --> 25:19.643
Well, I didn't have my own address,
so he sent it to his place.

25:21.019 --> 25:22.020
In Miami.

25:25.441 --> 25:27.151
You know about the place in Miami?

25:27.234 --> 25:29.695
Yeah, I used to hang out there
with him sometimes.

25:32.156 --> 25:33.574
Did you know about it?

25:35.159 --> 25:36.159
I did.

25:38.120 --> 25:39.246
Did you ever go there?

25:39.913 --> 25:41.206
[♪♪♪]

25:42.833 --> 25:43.833
Once.

25:46.920 --> 25:48.088
Just once, huh?

25:51.175 --> 25:52.175
Yeah.

25:54.636 --> 25:56.972
I hear that's where they found
all the drugs...

25:57.639 --> 25:59.099
in the Miami apartment.

26:01.769 --> 26:03.854
Do you know anything about that,
Nolan?

26:05.522 --> 26:06.522
No.

26:07.858 --> 26:08.858
I mean...

26:10.611 --> 26:14.531
maybe you saw something
while you were there, like in September.

26:14.615 --> 26:15.615
Nope.

26:16.700 --> 26:17.993
I didn't see anything.

26:20.037 --> 26:22.206
I wasn't even in Miami in September.

26:25.667 --> 26:28.837
Anyway, the money my dad
was sending stopped coming.

26:31.381 --> 26:32.966
Next thing I know, he's dead.

26:36.386 --> 26:37.386
Yeah.

26:39.890 --> 26:41.308
[phone ringing]

26:41.558 --> 26:43.268
How do you know
he's really Danny's son?

26:43.685 --> 26:47.981
- I don't, but I think I believe him.
- [Kevin] <i>Okay, so what does this mean?</i>

26:48.857 --> 26:51.568
[John] <i>I'm not certain. I just thought</i>
<i>that you guys should know.</i>

26:51.652 --> 26:55.239
Jesus Christ,
Danny was a fucking father?

26:55.322 --> 26:58.450
[John] <i>Listen, it doesn't seem like they</i>
<i>had much of a relationship.</i>

26:58.534 --> 26:59.743
Still, John...

26:59.827 --> 27:02.037
Still what, Kevin?
It doesn't change anything.

27:02.120 --> 27:03.580
[Kevin] <i>It doesn't? How can you say that?</i>

27:03.664 --> 27:05.082
The kid had a father and we...

27:05.165 --> 27:08.252
[John] <i>Kevin, Meg is right.</i>
<i>It doesn't change anything.</i>

27:08.335 --> 27:10.546
<i>I just thought you should know, that's it.</i>

27:12.089 --> 27:14.633
So are you bringing him
to the inn tonight or what?

27:14.716 --> 27:17.719
No, I'm not bringing him tonight.
Don't say anything to Mom.

27:17.803 --> 27:21.014
- There's too many questions.
- What's going on with the investigation?

27:21.932 --> 27:23.767
The investigation is at a standstill.

27:24.268 --> 27:26.478
<i>I'll fill you in at dinner tonight.
I gotta go.</i>

27:27.020 --> 27:28.313
[phone rings]

27:30.482 --> 27:32.359
Miss Rayburn,
the Islamorada Bank called...

27:32.442 --> 27:36.029
- I fucking told you I'll call them back.
- Sorry, Ms. Rayburn, I'll let them know.

27:36.738 --> 27:40.158
- Also, I just...
- What?

27:40.784 --> 27:43.662
Just wanted to remind you about
the dinner tonight with Miss Chaffee.

27:45.497 --> 27:46.623
[Meg] Thank you.

28:05.267 --> 28:07.269
- Wow.
- Pretty amazing, huh?

28:07.352 --> 28:09.187
The detail is...

28:11.857 --> 28:13.859
I can't believe this is really happening.

28:21.074 --> 28:22.492
You don't seem happy.

28:22.993 --> 28:27.205
What? No, come on.
No, this is incredible. I'm thrilled.

28:27.289 --> 28:31.877
No, you're not thrilled. I can see
that you're feeling some other feeling,

28:31.960 --> 28:34.087
but you won't tell me what it is,
so I have to guess.

28:34.171 --> 28:35.631
You don't have to guess, Belle.

28:35.714 --> 28:37.925
Well, then you have
to express yourself.

28:39.635 --> 28:42.721
We talked about this.
This was our problem the last time.

28:42.804 --> 28:47.267
You can't just go bouncing along
the surface of things anymore, Kevin.

28:47.351 --> 28:51.271
I wanna express myself, I do.

28:51.355 --> 28:52.355
Do you?

28:55.359 --> 28:57.945
Because you still won't even talk
about Danny.

29:02.616 --> 29:04.451
And that doesn't seem healthy to me.

29:05.535 --> 29:08.121
And there's no way
that I can help you...

29:09.790 --> 29:11.583
if I don't know
what's going on with you.

29:11.959 --> 29:13.961
[♪♪♪]

29:18.382 --> 29:22.219
I wanna tell you everything, I do. I...

29:28.058 --> 29:30.394
Whatever it is, Kev, just tell me.

29:30.477 --> 29:32.062
I'll be here.

29:34.481 --> 29:35.899
Just tell me.

29:40.237 --> 29:42.406
Whatever it is, I'll be here.

29:43.949 --> 29:45.659
I fucked up.

29:51.081 --> 29:52.916
I'm in so much shit.

30:06.805 --> 30:08.056
[exhales sharply]

30:15.022 --> 30:16.022
I'm broke.

30:17.941 --> 30:19.401
It's the bank.

30:22.362 --> 30:26.867
There are some obstacles
to buying the new marina.

30:28.577 --> 30:33.457
I thought your family agreed
to back the loan with the inn.

30:33.540 --> 30:34.416
That's the new loan,

30:34.499 --> 30:36.209
but I still have debts
on the old property.

30:36.293 --> 30:40.714
I'm hemorrhaging interest payments.
Business sucks, it's tailing off.

30:40.797 --> 30:44.134
Boat repair is cyclical.
There's weather, there are seasons.

30:44.217 --> 30:45.385
Bank doesn't care.

30:47.304 --> 30:51.975
I have a quarter to recover, and then,
I don't know, maybe even foreclosure.

30:52.893 --> 30:54.936
So that's what's bothering you?

30:56.271 --> 30:57.689
Financial problems?

30:59.399 --> 31:00.399
Yeah.

31:03.278 --> 31:04.863
Money is money, Kev.

31:07.324 --> 31:08.742
We'll get through this.

31:09.659 --> 31:12.287
How can I help you if I don't know
what you're going through?

31:14.414 --> 31:15.707
Well, now you know.

31:24.424 --> 31:25.967
[upbeat music playing over radio]

31:26.176 --> 31:28.595
[man] Very kind. What do you think?
[woman] Yeah, I think so.

31:28.678 --> 31:31.390
[man] You all wanna go on the boat?
[woman] Well, we can ask them.

31:31.473 --> 31:32.516
[Potts] Well, hello.

31:35.477 --> 31:36.478
[Diana] Hi.

31:36.686 --> 31:39.314
- Forgive me, we met at Robert's funeral.
- Yes.

31:39.398 --> 31:41.024
- But I...
- Diana.

31:41.108 --> 31:42.109
- Diana.
- John's wife.

31:42.192 --> 31:45.320
Of course, yes, yes.
Well, it's nice to see you.

31:45.404 --> 31:47.114
It's nice to see you too.

31:47.197 --> 31:50.200
- Tell John I said hello.
- I'll do that.

31:50.283 --> 31:52.702
- So, have a good evening.
- You too.

32:22.232 --> 32:23.525
[Kevin] This what you need?
[Belle gasps]

32:23.608 --> 32:27.571
- You found it. Sally's favorite.
- [Diana] A little wilted, but...

32:27.654 --> 32:29.364
[Ben] Can you take this? Thank you.

32:29.448 --> 32:31.658
Did you know Lenny Potts
is staying here?

32:32.742 --> 32:36.163
- No, he's not.
- [Sally] Yeah, he is.

32:36.246 --> 32:38.165
Can't seem to get enough of the place.

32:39.833 --> 32:41.251
Well, that's great.

32:42.669 --> 32:45.255
[Kevin] I need some water, please.
[Belle] Okay.

32:45.338 --> 32:48.758
[Kevin] Mother, sit down.
Please sit down. I'm starving.

32:49.342 --> 32:51.136
- [Belle] Do we have everything?
- Yeah.

32:51.261 --> 32:52.804
[Belle] Okay.

33:07.277 --> 33:09.863
- No way. I lost your name, Mom.
- Wow.

33:09.946 --> 33:11.072
[Janey] Ouch.
[Diana] Wow.

33:11.156 --> 33:12.156
[Sally and Ben laugh]

33:24.628 --> 33:26.838
- You heard this, right?
- [Diana] You can have a half of one.

33:26.922 --> 33:28.465
[Ben] Okay, that's fine.

33:52.948 --> 33:54.991
[Kevin] So this guy
you keep talking about, Lowry...

33:55.075 --> 33:56.284
[car alarm wailing over phone]

33:56.368 --> 33:58.870
[John] Wayne Lowry.
[Kevin] Wayne Lowry.

33:59.412 --> 34:01.873
Meg, is that you? Can you hear me?

34:02.207 --> 34:03.727
[Meg over phone] <i>Yeah, I'm still here.</i>

34:04.292 --> 34:05.377
Sorry, I'm listening.

34:06.002 --> 34:08.420
So this guy, Wayne Lowry,
now he's a suspect?

34:08.505 --> 34:09.965
He's behind this.

34:10.840 --> 34:11.840
He's behind this.

34:12.384 --> 34:14.103
We don't think
that he killed Danny himself,

34:14.177 --> 34:16.804
but we believe
that he had someone do it for him.

34:16.888 --> 34:19.641
- Why aren't you looking for that person?
- We are.

34:20.766 --> 34:23.478
It's just that that line
of the investigation has gone cold.

34:23.562 --> 34:25.313
It's complicated.

34:25.981 --> 34:29.234
The DEA has been looking
at Wayne Lowry for trafficking.

34:29.693 --> 34:31.820
That's the same ring
that Danny was caught up in.

34:32.612 --> 34:35.699
Well, you're talking
about the drugs they found in Miami?

34:35.907 --> 34:36.947
[siren wailing over phone]

34:36.992 --> 34:40.245

stole those drugs from Wayne Lowry,

at Wayne Lowry for the murder.

49:32.761 --> 49:35.639
- Saw us where?
- Miami. Danny's apartment.

49:35.723 --> 49:39.101
Nobody saw us there, Kevin.
You have no reason to be scared.

49:39.185 --> 49:42.605
The only one
that they're looking at is Wayne Lowry.

49:42.688 --> 49:44.648
- That's it.
- What about Marco? Hm?

49:44.982 --> 49:47.443
Marco is spinning his wheels.
I'm watching him.

49:47.526 --> 49:49.945
Whatever he does, he brings to me.
I'm on top of that.

49:50.029 --> 49:52.029
- Then there's this kid.
- Don't worry about the kid.

49:52.072 --> 49:54.491
- What is he doing here?
- I'll worry about the kid.

49:54.575 --> 49:57.536
Don't fucking worry
about the kid, man.

49:58.370 --> 49:59.663
I'll worry about the kid.

49:59.747 --> 50:00.747
[both laugh]

50:00.915 --> 50:04.418
All you gotta do, is you just gotta
take care of your wife and your kid.

50:04.501 --> 50:08.130
Everything else is fine.
Come here. Everything is fine.

50:12.843 --> 50:14.553
[crying]

50:17.348 --> 50:18.766
[Kevin sighs]

50:24.813 --> 50:26.106
Hey, man, do you...?

50:31.946 --> 50:34.865
- What?
- You know, do you...?

50:35.407 --> 50:36.825
Do you feel guilty?

50:38.911 --> 50:39.912
At all?

50:40.454 --> 50:42.248
You can't think like that.

50:46.961 --> 50:49.588
The other day,
I wanted to tell Belle so bad.

50:50.839 --> 50:51.839
You know?

50:53.884 --> 50:56.178
That would be a really bad idea.

50:58.681 --> 51:00.474
Yeah, I know it would be
a bad idea, John.

51:00.557 --> 51:04.436
I didn't say that I was gonna tell her.
I said that I wanted to tell her.

51:04.520 --> 51:05.521
And I'm telling you this

51:05.604 --> 51:09.316
because you are the only person
that I can fucking talk to.

51:14.530 --> 51:16.365
Because we had to do it, right?

51:17.616 --> 51:18.616
Right?

51:21.662 --> 51:23.080
We didn't have a choice.

51:25.165 --> 51:26.542
Yes, Kevin.

51:28.377 --> 51:29.795
We had to do it.

51:36.385 --> 51:38.721
[cell phone ringing]

51:42.558 --> 51:43.767
Yeah, Marco.

51:45.811 --> 51:47.021
Yeah, I'll be right there.

51:52.443 --> 51:53.569
[kids laughing]

51:53.652 --> 51:55.195
[doorbell rings]

51:56.530 --> 51:59.658
You gonna make him stand out there
all day with your pizza?

52:01.744 --> 52:04.246
All right, you're doing the dishes.

52:04.663 --> 52:06.665
[doorbell ringing]

52:11.920 --> 52:13.320
Monroe County Sheriff's Department.

52:13.380 --> 52:15.507
We're executing a warranted search
of this property.

52:15.591 --> 52:18.761
- Step aside, sir.
- This is fucking harassment.

52:19.303 --> 52:20.512
I'm calling my lawyer.

52:20.596 --> 52:24.016
You do that.
In the meantime, we'll get started.

52:27.644 --> 52:28.937
Hey, boys. Come here.

52:29.021 --> 52:31.857
I'm gonna need you to come upstairs,
call your folks,

52:31.940 --> 52:35.778
have them come and pick you up.
Let's go. Right upstairs.

52:35.861 --> 52:39.281
Let's go. Come on.
Let's go. Come on.

52:43.994 --> 52:46.997
You don't know what you're fucking with,
detective.

52:47.831 --> 52:49.833
[indistinct radio chatter]

52:52.669 --> 52:54.546
- This is Meg Rayburn.
- [man over phone] <i>Hi, Miss Rayburn.</i>

52:54.630 --> 52:57.299
Sorry I couldn't call back sooner.
What exactly is the issue?

52:57.966 --> 52:59.846
We're closing out
all of your father's accounts.

52:59.885 --> 53:02.471
We came across a disbursement
we needed to ask you about.

53:02.554 --> 53:04.431
<i>What kind of disbursement?</i>

53:04.515 --> 53:07.226
It's a check your father sent
from his personal account every month.

53:07.601 --> 53:10.229
I don't know anything about it.
You have to talk to my mom.

53:10.312 --> 53:12.564
<i>I'm afraid I can't actually do that,
Miss Rayburn.</i>

53:12.981 --> 53:15.150
Your father was explicit
in his instructions.

53:15.234 --> 53:16.860
He wanted this account
kept confidential.

53:17.778 --> 53:19.655
Does anyone in my family
have access?

53:19.738 --> 53:21.657
<i>Not according to our paperwork, no.</i>

53:22.199 --> 53:23.617
Then why are you calling me?

53:23.700 --> 53:26.328
<i>Your father listed you as his trustee.</i>

53:26.412 --> 53:29.289
I can't provide additional information
over the phone,

53:29.373 --> 53:32.167
but how about I send over
an account authorization

53:32.251 --> 53:35.254
- and you can log in for yourself?
<i>- Okay, yeah. Sure.</i>

53:35.337 --> 53:36.839
And now that he's passed,

53:36.922 --> 53:39.550
it'll be your decision whether or not
to terminate the payments.

53:40.592 --> 53:43.303
I guess that depends on who
he was sending the money to.

53:47.141 --> 53:49.017
John, we're still
looking through everything,

53:49.101 --> 53:51.019
but so far the house is clean.

53:52.729 --> 53:53.729
[cell phone rings]

53:56.525 --> 53:57.818
I gotta take this.

53:59.736 --> 54:00.736
Yeah.

54:00.904 --> 54:04.283
- [woman] <i>Is this Detective John Rayburn?</i>
- This is him.

54:04.867 --> 54:08.120
Yeah, I'm calling from the Dade County
runaway shelter in Miami.

54:08.203 --> 54:11.582
- <i>You called about Nolan Rayburn?</i>
- Yes, I did.

54:11.874 --> 54:15.419
<i>Well, he's been registered here
several times. How can I help you?</i>

54:16.753 --> 54:18.130
I wondered if you could tell me

54:18.213 --> 54:22.468
if he was in Miami anytime,
say, around September?

54:23.552 --> 54:24.720
Let me see.

54:25.762 --> 54:28.474
- This past September?
- Yes.

54:29.016 --> 54:30.476
<i>Uh...</i>

54:31.768 --> 54:35.564
Yes, he spent almost a week here.

54:36.482 --> 54:37.774
<i>Anything else?</i>

54:40.194 --> 54:41.653
No, that's it. Thank you.

54:59.713 --> 55:01.715
[♪♪♪]

56:04.403 --> 56:05.654
[knocking]

56:06.071 --> 56:07.071
It's me.

56:14.663 --> 56:16.081
John is lying to me.

56:34.057 --> 56:36.268
[cell phone ringing]

56:46.194 --> 56:47.194
Hello.

56:50.824 --> 56:51.825
Who is this?

57:12.638 --> 57:13.638
What do you want?

57:13.680 --> 57:17.476
I didn't like your brother,
but I didn't kill him.

57:19.394 --> 57:21.897
Now, the son of a bitch may be dead...

57:22.856 --> 57:25.484
but he's still making
my life miserable.

57:26.234 --> 57:30.447
Now, I know you had
a complicated relationship with him, too.

57:30.948 --> 57:33.158
You didn't answer my question.
What do you want?

57:35.869 --> 57:37.871
You're gonna do something for me.

57:40.666 --> 57:42.084
I am?

57:42.876 --> 57:46.088
I want you
to make this investigation go away.

57:51.051 --> 57:53.220
I don't think I'm gonna do that.

57:53.303 --> 57:55.347
Oh, I think you will.

58:14.866 --> 58:16.535
[Danny on recording] <i>Hey, John.</i>

58:17.452 --> 58:20.080
<i>I'd like you to meet my friend
Wayne Lowry.</i>

58:22.040 --> 58:27.546
