00:04.700 --> 00:07.050
Dele, we're going to be late.

00:07.250 --> 00:09.190
We need to get to church
before the Awolowos.

00:09.390 --> 00:10.540
They are pew hoppers.

00:10.740 --> 00:12.890
I never thought
I'd be a church guy.

00:13.090 --> 00:14.580
And I'm very proud of you.

00:14.780 --> 00:17.150
Well, between the food
and the juicy gossip,

00:17.350 --> 00:18.980
it's not as miserable
as I thought.

00:19.180 --> 00:21.590
You should be going to church
because you'll be welcomed

00:21.790 --> 00:23.030
into the kingdom of heaven.

00:23.230 --> 00:25.460
Yeah, that's good, too.

00:25.660 --> 00:27.990
By the way, did you know
Ife's not even Nigerian?

00:28.190 --> 00:29.210
No.Eh?

00:29.410 --> 00:31.250
Keep it under your <i>gele.</i>

00:31.450 --> 00:33.340

00:33.540 --> 00:34.950
<i>E karo,</i>Mummy.
You look lovely.

00:35.150 --> 00:36.430
BOB:
Oh, look at this stud.

00:36.630 --> 00:38.350
You going to church
or the Met Gala?

00:38.550 --> 00:39.780
Thank you.

00:39.980 --> 00:42.050
You could not just
let me have my moment?

00:42.250 --> 00:43.860
Sorry.

00:45.340 --> 00:47.090
DOTTIE:
So, what do we think--

00:47.290 --> 00:49.270
am I gonna pull focus
from the pastor?

00:49.470 --> 00:50.660
You look wonderful.

00:50.860 --> 00:51.530
I'm glad you
decided to come.

00:51.730 --> 00:53.540
You invited her?

00:53.740 --> 00:55.060
Well, you said it was
the best part of your week.

00:55.260 --> 00:56.450
I wanted to see what
all the fuss was about.

00:56.650 --> 00:59.850
That's just great.

01:00.050 --> 01:01.580
Are you even allowed
in the church?

01:02.320 --> 01:05.370
Bob. We have to go.

01:05.570 --> 01:07.940
Dele, get in the car.

01:08.140 --> 01:09.550
Move your ass, Bobby.

01:09.750 --> 01:12.340
I'm not sure I should go.
I'm not feeling great.

01:12.540 --> 01:14.340
She's a nurse.
It never works.

01:14.540 --> 01:15.110
Let's go.

This isn't your night
at the Copa, Mom.

02:33.280 --> 02:35.380
Ow.Leave your mother alone.

02:35.580 --> 02:36.420
She's only doing it
for attention.

02:36.620 --> 02:38.030
That's why she's wearing
that stupid hat.

I see God is not the only one

Oh. Well, I am going to
have to hire a contractor.Why?

04:02.580 --> 04:04.510
Because when I sing
into that machine,

04:04.710 --> 04:06.810
I will blow the roof
off this place.

04:08.500 --> 04:10.170
Do I smell stockfish?

04:10.370 --> 04:12.040
Well, my mother sent me
a housewarming package

04:12.240 --> 04:13.300
from Nigeria.

04:13.500 --> 04:15.260
I also brought a gift.

04:15.460 --> 04:17.520
Oh, Uncle, you did not have to.Of course I did.

04:17.720 --> 04:20.180
We are practically roommates.

04:20.380 --> 04:22.270
Well, thank you for coming by.

04:22.470 --> 04:23.700
I am sure you are busy.

04:23.900 --> 04:26.360
As soon as I got a whiff
of that stockfish,

04:26.560 --> 04:29.320
my schedule opened up.

04:29.520 --> 04:31.580
I will get another bowl.

04:31.780 --> 04:33.580
Oh, and a better beer.

04:33.780 --> 04:36.400
I-I don't care for these.

Chukwuemeka and I
celebrated our engagement

04:47.490 --> 04:49.120
by drinking mimosas bottomless.

04:49.320 --> 04:51.250
You mean bottomless mimosas.

04:51.450 --> 04:52.950
I said it right.

04:53.150 --> 04:54.780
No, you...

04:54.980 --> 04:55.810
Ew.

04:57.160 --> 05:00.260
I took my mother-in-law
to church and saved her soul.

05:00.460 --> 05:01.610
Um, seeing as it was me

05:01.810 --> 05:02.960
who first brought you
to our church,

05:03.160 --> 05:05.790
technically,
I saved Dottie's soul.

05:05.990 --> 05:08.360
Please tell her
she's very welcome.

05:08.560 --> 05:11.010
Fine, we are both
model Christians.

05:11.210 --> 05:12.620
I'm not sure
bragging about it's

05:12.820 --> 05:15.190
very Christian.You don't think

05:15.390 --> 05:17.230
Jesus boasted when he
fed all those people

05:17.430 --> 05:18.370
with one loaf of bread?

05:18.570 --> 05:21.010
How else did the
story get out?

05:22.060 --> 05:23.410
You should come with us
this Sunday.

05:23.610 --> 05:24.460
I have a church, thank you.

05:24.660 --> 05:26.290
You only go on holidays.

05:26.490 --> 05:28.070
I don't have to go every week.

05:28.270 --> 05:29.680
My mother always told me

05:29.880 --> 05:32.160
there's no wrong way
to love God.

05:32.360 --> 05:34.160
That is a nice sentiment.

05:34.360 --> 05:35.640
But it is nonsense.

05:35.840 --> 05:37.910
Let me take you
to prayer group.

05:38.110 --> 05:39.470
I think you would love
our fellowship luncheon.

05:39.670 --> 05:40.820
I'm good.

05:41.020 --> 05:42.260
You are pushing
too hard.

05:42.460 --> 05:44.260
I could get you in the choir.

05:44.460 --> 05:45.440
We could use your husky voice.

05:45.640 --> 05:47.920
Stop saving her.
I will save her.

05:48.120 --> 05:50.180
You already saved someone
this week, it is my turn!

05:50.380 --> 05:52.310
You getting commission
or something?No.

05:52.510 --> 05:53.660
But it's not a bad idea.

05:53.860 --> 05:55.270
I will mention it
to the pastor.

05:55.470 --> 05:57.140
I will mention it
to the pastor!Oh...

05:57.340 --> 05:59.100
Gloria? Gloria.

05:59.300 --> 06:02.400

She needs Jesus!

I-I was saving that
for a special occasion.

06:58.620 --> 07:00.590
Look around, my friend.

07:01.720 --> 07:03.120

Fantastic. I need a place

07:03.320 --> 07:04.950
where I can get away
from all the crap at home

07:05.150 --> 07:06.340
and just hang with the guys.

07:06.540 --> 07:08.520

Are you and Abishola
having problems?

07:11.030 --> 07:12.170
No, no, we're great.
It's my mom

07:12.370 --> 07:14.220

in her sleep.

07:14.420 --> 07:16.090
Oh, that is a relief.

07:16.290 --> 07:18.830
I've tried being polite,
but she won't take a hint.

07:19.030 --> 07:21.530
Some people are
completely oblivious

07:21.730 --> 07:22.880
to when they have overstayed

07:23.080 --> 07:24.490
their welcome.Welcome?

07:24.690 --> 07:25.670
I didn't invite her, she just

07:25.870 --> 07:26.930
came over and never left.

07:27.130 --> 07:28.100
That is awful.

07:28.300 --> 07:29.980
Yes, it is.

07:30.170 --> 07:33.070
You must set boundaries
for your own peace of mind.

07:33.260 --> 07:36.240
Get clear on what you need,
and demand it.

07:36.440 --> 07:38.330
You're right. I need to not
worry about hurting feelings

07:38.530 --> 07:39.550
and just come out with it.

07:39.750 --> 07:43.730
I would really like
some alone time.

07:43.930 --> 07:45.250
That was perfect.

07:45.450 --> 07:47.210
Say it just like that, Bob,

07:47.410 --> 07:49.590
you will not be ignored.

07:54.290 --> 07:55.650

Hey. I'm making Olu's
egusi soup recipe

07:59.200 --> 08:00.660
for the potluck.

08:00.860 --> 08:03.260

I'm practically Nigerian.

08:04.300 --> 08:07.800
Yeah, I don't think they use
Guy Fieri's Donkey Sauce.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.410
I'm doing my take on it.There's no take.

08:10.610 --> 08:12.230
It's their culture.
You don't think sometimes

08:12.430 --> 08:14.590
I want to throw
a little ranch on the suya?

08:14.780 --> 08:16.150
But I don't,
because I'm a guest.

08:16.350 --> 08:17.680
Well, I just want
to be involved.

08:17.870 --> 08:20.030
You know, sing in
the church choir,

08:20.220 --> 08:21.420
go to the picnics,
and what's that thing

08:21.620 --> 08:23.420
where everybody gets together
to study the Bible?

08:23.620 --> 08:25.600
Bible study?Yeah, that.

08:25.800 --> 08:28.900
I got you something.

Agape Lutheran.

I'm just giving you options
to fill your Sundays.

08:38.200 --> 08:40.220
You ever do paint and sip?

08:40.420 --> 08:42.400
But I like our church.

08:42.590 --> 08:45.270
Plus, I'm already
in the hole 500 bucks.

08:45.470 --> 08:47.100
Well, how about
I write you a check

08:47.300 --> 08:49.350
and you go Jesus hunting
someplace else?

08:50.830 --> 08:52.620
I didn't realize you hated
being around me so much.

08:52.820 --> 08:54.320
I'm not saying that.

08:54.520 --> 08:55.930
I thought we were
having a good time.

08:56.130 --> 08:57.410
Everybody was happy
for me to be there

08:57.610 --> 08:58.460
except for my own son.

08:58.650 --> 09:00.150
They are happy.

09:00.350 --> 09:01.720
Please leave them alone
so they can stay that way.

09:01.920 --> 09:03.200
You know what,

09:03.400 --> 09:04.940
you can have
your church back.

09:05.140 --> 09:07.680
Thank you.In fact, I'll do
you one better.

09:07.880 --> 09:09.340
I'll get out of your
frickin' house.

09:09.530 --> 09:11.070
Aw, don't be so dramatic.

09:12.630 --> 09:14.640
Where are you gonna go?

09:16.380 --> 09:18.210
Bobby threw me out.

09:18.410 --> 09:22.480
Oh, well, you always
have a home here.

09:22.680 --> 09:25.220
Both in my arms and my abode.

09:25.420 --> 09:27.270
I will be a pillar
of strength in...

09:27.470 --> 09:28.750
Would you just let me in?

09:28.950 --> 09:30.140
Right this way.

09:30.340 --> 09:31.830
Get my bag.

09:41.620 --> 09:43.670
The cost reports are outrageous.

09:43.870 --> 09:45.330
Well, that's what happens
when you open a factory.

09:45.530 --> 09:46.720
You got to spend money
to make money.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.640
But when are we going
to make money?

09:48.840 --> 09:49.980
Just hang in there.

09:50.180 --> 09:51.510
We'll be out of the red
in six months.

09:51.710 --> 09:53.950
Give or take six months.

09:54.140 --> 09:55.990
That's right, have faith.

09:56.190 --> 09:58.820
But not too much faith.
Bobby doesn't like that.

09:59.020 --> 10:01.210
Mom, can you get under my skin
after the meeting?

10:01.410 --> 10:04.170
I'll put it in my calendar.

10:04.370 --> 10:06.260
Douglas, the new hires
start next week.

10:06.460 --> 10:08.700
Make sure you have all
the intake paperwork ready.Yep.

10:08.900 --> 10:10.350
Also made an orientation video.

10:10.550 --> 10:11.920
Went a little over budget,

10:12.120 --> 10:13.700
but we'll just hire
one less guy.

10:14.910 --> 10:16.450
What do you think
of these throw pillows?

10:16.650 --> 10:18.100
Oh, those would look
great in the living room.

10:18.300 --> 10:19.840
They're on sale.Oh, we should get 'em.

10:20.040 --> 10:21.490
Guys.

10:22.490 --> 10:25.460
Oh, excuse us, your majesty.

10:25.650 --> 10:26.760
Everyone,

10:26.960 --> 10:29.320
Bob Wheeler is speaking.

10:31.710 --> 10:33.850
You know, Mom, you're welcome
to stay at my house, too.

10:34.050 --> 10:35.510
Oh, thank you, sweetie.

10:35.710 --> 10:36.990
What are you doing?

10:37.190 --> 10:38.820
I'm your little brother.
I like to piss you off.

10:39.020 --> 10:40.250
GOODWIN:
Let's talk about

10:40.450 --> 10:41.910
the shipments for next week.

10:42.110 --> 10:43.780
We got to try and cut
our turnaround time.

10:43.980 --> 10:45.040
I don't want to
pay people to hang out.

10:45.240 --> 10:46.260
DOTTIE:
I got a hankering

10:46.460 --> 10:48.000
for tacos tonight.

10:48.200 --> 10:51.130
What do you say-- you want
to head down Mexico way?

10:51.330 --> 10:53.000
Ooh, <i>sí, señorita.</i>

10:53.200 --> 10:54.050
Where you going?

10:54.250 --> 10:55.820
Just, uh, give me a second.

10:58.260 --> 11:01.090
[screaming]

11:02.830 --> 11:04.920
All right,
let's ship some socks.

11:09.010 --> 11:11.200
[humming a tune]

11:11.400 --> 11:12.720
Hello.

11:12.920 --> 11:14.850
[continues humming]

11:15.050 --> 11:18.330
A little cheery for someone who
just switched out a catheter.

11:18.530 --> 11:20.030
Did you get another
doctor fired?

11:20.230 --> 11:22.030
No.

11:22.230 --> 11:24.170
Did a white patient pronounce
your name correctly?

11:24.370 --> 11:26.080
No, I had a normal morning

11:26.280 --> 11:27.300
with Bob, Dele, and Mummy.

11:27.500 --> 11:28.340
And after they left,

11:28.540 --> 11:30.690
I had a little time to myself.

11:30.890 --> 11:33.350
Oh, nice to relax before work.

11:33.550 --> 11:36.130
Yes. I organized
the kitchen drawers,

11:36.330 --> 11:37.960
cleaned out the pantry

11:38.160 --> 11:40.700
and got rid of a pesky clog
in the shower drain.

11:40.900 --> 11:43.320
Ooh, sounds magical.Yes.

11:43.510 --> 11:44.710
Ah-ha.

11:44.910 --> 11:45.710
What?

11:45.910 --> 11:47.890
You usually have some anecdote

11:48.080 --> 11:50.710
about your mother-in-law eating
an omelet in an open robe.

11:50.910 --> 11:53.500
Oh, stop making me
picture stuff.

11:53.700 --> 11:56.370
It seems Dottie's absence
has put pep in your step.

11:56.570 --> 11:58.360
You're step
is normally pep-less.

11:59.760 --> 12:02.770
When my mother moved to Hawaii,
my skin cleared up,

12:02.970 --> 12:03.990
I slept better,

12:04.190 --> 12:05.340
my cholesterol went down.

12:05.540 --> 12:07.210
I could even have dairy again.

12:07.410 --> 12:09.210
Well, I am not like you.

12:09.410 --> 12:10.430
I would never be happy

12:10.630 --> 12:12.260
that Bob
disrespected his mother.

12:12.460 --> 12:14.260
Oh. Okay then.

12:14.460 --> 12:17.040
Call her, tell her
to move back in.

12:17.240 --> 12:18.730
Okay.

12:24.090 --> 12:26.740
Oh, my God,
I'm a terrible person.

12:27.830 --> 12:29.010
Welcome to
the dark side,

12:29.210 --> 12:32.360
where we eat cheese
and look amazing.

12:35.620 --> 12:37.330
And that was when I knew

12:37.530 --> 12:39.280
I could rewire anything.

12:39.480 --> 12:41.850
I was six.

12:42.050 --> 12:44.250
You said the story
was about college.

12:44.450 --> 12:45.550
I'm getting there.

12:45.750 --> 12:47.120
[knocking]

12:47.320 --> 12:49.690
Oh, did you order dinner,
you rascal?

12:49.890 --> 12:53.460
No, it must be an
unexpected visitor.

12:55.030 --> 12:58.040
Oh. Hello, cousin.
How unexpected.

12:58.240 --> 13:01.430
Kofo, I am here
spontaneously.

13:02.600 --> 13:03.570
Goodwin,

13:03.770 --> 13:04.610
you came in the middle

13:04.810 --> 13:06.090
of a very interesting story.

13:06.290 --> 13:07.400
But don't worry,

13:07.600 --> 13:08.790
I will start again.

13:08.990 --> 13:11.140
Perhaps first we
should let Goodwin

13:11.340 --> 13:13.270
tell us why he is here.

13:13.470 --> 13:15.540
It is a good thing I am here.

13:15.740 --> 13:17.840
You have work tomorrow.

13:18.040 --> 13:20.670
You cannot afford
to spend your evenings

13:20.870 --> 13:22.760
talking until the wee hours.

13:22.960 --> 13:26.290
But I am having
so much fun.

13:26.490 --> 13:27.640
Of course you are.

13:27.840 --> 13:30.290
He's a wonderful storyteller.

13:30.490 --> 13:32.380
But I cannot allow it.

13:32.580 --> 13:34.950
I am sorry Uncle Tunde,

13:35.150 --> 13:37.780
but you must leave.

13:37.980 --> 13:39.740
Okay, well, you
are the bad guy.

13:39.940 --> 13:41.560
[chuckles] Well,

13:41.760 --> 13:43.700
I suppose I should
be getting home.

13:43.900 --> 13:46.000
I'll be back for movie night

13:46.200 --> 13:48.780
when Mr. Buzzkill is not around.

13:52.300 --> 13:53.970
[door closes]

13:54.170 --> 13:57.140
Thank you for
coming to my rescue.

13:57.340 --> 13:58.840
He would not
stop talking.

13:59.040 --> 14:00.280
I tried to take a toilet break

14:00.480 --> 14:03.190
but he continued to tell
the story through the door.

14:04.450 --> 14:05.680
I am glad to be
the person you call

14:05.870 --> 14:07.320
when you need to be chastised.

14:08.360 --> 14:10.810
This is very nice.

14:11.010 --> 14:12.200
Thank you, cousin.

14:12.400 --> 14:13.990
I am proud of you, Kofo.

14:14.190 --> 14:15.630
Congratulations.

14:17.240 --> 14:18.380
Are you going to watch
the Arsenal game?

14:18.580 --> 14:20.250
No.Well, I am.

14:20.450 --> 14:21.940
Put it on.

14:26.820 --> 14:28.740
<i>Kaale,</i>Mama Ebun.

14:28.940 --> 14:29.960
I need you to get my suitcase

14:30.160 --> 14:31.440
down from the attic.

14:31.640 --> 14:33.310
I have decided to
throw myself out on the street

14:33.510 --> 14:34.660
before you do.

14:34.860 --> 14:36.490
I don't think
it was unreasonable

14:36.690 --> 14:38.970
to ask my mom for some space.

14:39.170 --> 14:41.450
You have made sacrifices
since her stroke.

14:41.650 --> 14:42.580
Yes.You invited her

14:42.780 --> 14:44.150
into your home.

14:44.350 --> 14:45.890
You rearranged
your life for her.

14:46.090 --> 14:46.890
Thank you.But...

14:47.090 --> 14:48.670
Here it comes.

14:48.870 --> 14:49.810
...have you ever thought about

14:50.010 --> 14:51.550
what your mother has given up?

14:51.750 --> 14:53.240
Pretty sure
you're gonna tell me.

14:53.440 --> 14:54.900
Now that she is healthy,

14:55.100 --> 14:56.990
she spends
much of her time alone.

14:57.190 --> 14:59.290
Well, I can't devote
every second of my life to her.

14:59.490 --> 15:01.380
She knows that,
which is why she went

15:01.580 --> 15:02.780
searching for fellowship.Well why does she

15:02.970 --> 15:04.730
have to find it at my church?

15:04.930 --> 15:07.860
I just got them to stop
calling me White Bob.

15:08.990 --> 15:10.570
It is not easy to have

15:10.770 --> 15:12.740
your circumstances
change suddenly

15:12.940 --> 15:14.740
and find yourself
as a permanent guest

15:14.940 --> 15:16.480
in your child's home.

15:16.680 --> 15:18.920
We're not just talking about
my mom anymore, are we?

15:19.120 --> 15:22.060
Who else would we
be talking about?

15:22.260 --> 15:24.580
Well, it sounds like you're
feeling a little unwanted.

15:24.780 --> 15:26.060
So you are kicking me out?

15:26.260 --> 15:27.890
No, I'm trying to be sensitive.

15:28.090 --> 15:29.630
Go get the suitcase!I'm not doing it!

15:29.830 --> 15:30.880
You're here till you die!

15:39.540 --> 15:41.770
Mm, let's have some more.

15:41.970 --> 15:44.380
It's a slumber party.
We can be bad.

15:44.580 --> 15:46.170
What are you, 12?

15:46.370 --> 15:47.560
[knocking]

15:47.760 --> 15:48.600
You know, you wouldn't
let me have

15:48.800 --> 15:50.080
any more ice cream then, either.

15:50.280 --> 15:51.650
You're welcome.

15:51.850 --> 15:53.950
Someone had to save you
from the chub club.

15:55.990 --> 15:58.130
Oh, hey, guys. Come on in.

15:59.210 --> 16:00.960
What, moving across town
wasn't far enough for you?

16:01.160 --> 16:02.310
Well, I'm not
going to Canada.

16:02.510 --> 16:04.970
Those people give me the creeps.

16:05.170 --> 16:06.960
Did you miss this?

16:09.090 --> 16:10.190
I'm sorry about what I said.

16:10.390 --> 16:12.020
I was being selfish.

16:12.220 --> 16:14.280
And disrespectful.
And blasphemous.

16:14.480 --> 16:15.410
Honey, I got this.

16:15.610 --> 16:17.110
If you want to go to church,

16:17.310 --> 16:18.290
you can do that.

16:18.490 --> 16:20.290
I love you
and I'm always happy

16:20.490 --> 16:22.510
to have you around.
Please come home, Mom.

16:22.710 --> 16:24.420
Oh, that is so nice.

16:24.620 --> 16:26.380
I'll get your bag.

16:26.580 --> 16:27.690
Thank you for
saying that, Bobby,

16:27.890 --> 16:29.380
but I'm gonna stay.

16:29.580 --> 16:30.600
What?What?

16:30.800 --> 16:33.040
You deserve to
live your life

16:33.240 --> 16:34.740
without me being around 24-7.

16:34.940 --> 16:36.560
Only if that's
what you really want.

16:37.430 --> 16:39.040
You've taken care
of me long enough.

16:42.340 --> 16:45.100
We're gonna have a
blast, aren't we honey?
