SOMETHING ABOUT YOURSELF.

02:47.876 --> 02:51.335

VVHY DON'T THEY VVORK PROPERLY?

03:06.269 --> 03:09.307
OFFHAND, I'D SAY IT'S 'CAUSE
YOU DON'T TREAT THEM PROPERLY.

03:09.398 --> 03:12.516

TURNED IN MY HAND.

09:29.944 --> 09:35.030

DELIBERATELY HIT THE SIDE OF THE GARAGE.

09:35.075 --> 09:37.533

IF YOU'RE DEPRESSED, SEE A DOCTOR.
IF YOU'RE HAPPY, SEE A DOCTOR.

10:16.366 --> 10:20.781
IF THE SALARY IS TOO LOI/I/ AND THE
MORTGAGE IS TOO HIGH, SEE A DOCTOR.
