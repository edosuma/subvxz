<i>My name is Michael Westen.</i>
<i>I used to be a spy until...</i>

00:04.586 --> 00:07.121
We got a burn notice
on you. You're blacklisted.

00:07.189 --> 00:09.557
<i>When you're burned,</i>
<i>you've got nothing --</i>

00:09.625 --> 00:12.219
<i>no cash, no credit,</i>
<i>no job history.</i>

00:12.223 --> 00:14.491
<i>You're stuck in whatever city</i>
<i>they decide to dump you in.</i>

00:14.559 --> 00:16.526
- Where am I?
- Miami.

00:16.939 --> 00:20.108
<i>You do whatever work</i>
<i>comes your way.</i>

00:20.176 --> 00:22.744
<i>You rely on anyone</i>
<i>who's still talking to you.</i>

00:22.812 --> 00:24.346
<i>A trigger-happy</i>
<i>ex-girlfriend...</i>

00:24.413 --> 00:25.981
Should we shoot them?

00:26.048 --> 00:28.550
<i>...An old friend who used</i>
<i>to inform on you to the FBI...</i>

00:28.618 --> 00:30.952
You know spies --
a bunch of bitchy little girls.

00:31.020 --> 00:33.488
<i>...Family, too...</i>
<i>Hey, is that your mom again?</i>

00:33.556 --> 00:35.657
<i>...If you're desperate.</i>
<i>Someone needs your help, Michael.</i>

00:35.725 --> 00:38.159
<i>Bottom line --</i>
<i>as long as you're burned,</i>

00:38.227 --> 00:39.828
<i>you're not going anywhere.</i>

<i>There's nothing more frustrating</i>

00:54.096 --> 00:57.461
<i>for a spy, than being on the sideline</i>
<i>for a important operation.</i>

00:57.778 --> 01:00.288
<i>When you spent your career</i>
<i>in the middle of the action</i>

01:00.488 --> 01:02.484
<i>it's tough to take on a supporting role.</i>

01:02.684 --> 01:05.533
<i>Particularly when you're stuck</i>
<i>helping people pack.</i>

01:07.203 --> 01:07.970
Thanks, Mike.

01:08.031 --> 01:09.609
Look,
I know that it hurts

01:09.620 --> 01:10.305
that you're stuck here

01:10.352 --> 01:11.953
while Jesse and I
are out after the list,

01:12.021 --> 01:13.221
but this is
the smart play.

01:13.289 --> 01:15.590
Just got
the confirmation.

01:15.658 --> 01:17.325
We are in.

01:17.393 --> 01:19.427
Auction for the list goes down
in three days.

01:19.495 --> 01:21.095
We got a meeting
with the seller

01:21.163 --> 01:22.530
as soon as we land
in Santo Domingo.

01:22.598 --> 01:24.365
Wait. So the guy sent
a wedding invitation

01:24.433 --> 01:26.000
with instructions
for the auction?

01:26.068 --> 01:27.969
Yep. It's gonna be
an "exclusive affair,"

01:28.037 --> 01:29.971
restricted to "close
friends and family."

01:30.039 --> 01:32.240
Three days isn't much time
to clock this guy's security,

01:32.308 --> 01:33.308
find out where
he's hidden the list,

01:33.375 --> 01:34.542
<i>and</i> steal it.

01:34.610 --> 01:35.777
You know,
maybe I should come with you --

01:35.844 --> 01:38.546
Mikey, look,
if we get that list,

01:38.614 --> 01:40.381
it's the names of all the people
that burned you,

01:40.449 --> 01:41.916
the same people
who quarantined you in Miami.

01:41.984 --> 01:43.284
So this is not the time

01:43.352 --> 01:44.752
for you to be doing stuff
that raises eyebrows --

01:44.820 --> 01:47.755
like, you know, leaving
the country for three days.

01:47.823 --> 01:50.425
Fine.

01:50.492 --> 01:53.494
Just in case --
borrowed this from Fi.

01:53.562 --> 01:57.098
It's been modified
to shoot three-round bursts.

01:57.166 --> 01:58.199
Thanks, Mike.

01:58.267 --> 01:59.467
But, look,
we're gonna be fine.

01:59.535 --> 02:01.069
Nate's flying in today,
right?

02:01.136 --> 02:02.837
Pick him up. Enjoy some
family time. We got this, man.

02:05.474 --> 02:07.508
Promise me you'll call me
if you need me.

02:07.576 --> 02:09.043
Promise. Promise.

02:20.122 --> 02:21.756
<i>For a spy,</i>

02:21.824 --> 02:25.126
<i>it's often better to steal</i>
<i>secrets than pay for them.</i>

02:25.194 --> 02:26.527
<i>It saves money and time</i>

02:26.595 --> 02:28.429
<i>and doesn't leave</i>
<i>a messy paper trail.</i>

02:28.497 --> 02:31.232
<i>Of course, anyone who's in</i>
<i>the business of selling secrets</i>

02:31.300 --> 02:33.468
<i>is also in the business</i>
<i>of protecting them,</i>

02:33.535 --> 02:36.471
<i>which can make extracting</i>
<i>information nearly impossible.</i>

02:36.538 --> 02:37.805
<i>Just because your target</i>

02:37.873 --> 02:39.707
<i>is willing to share a meal</i>
<i>with you</i>

02:39.775 --> 02:41.376
<i>doesn't mean</i>
<i>he won't put a bullet</i>

02:41.443 --> 02:42.577
<i>in the back of your head.</i>

02:42.645 --> 02:45.246
Mr. Walsh.

02:45.314 --> 02:48.049
Got your wedding invitation.
Cute.

02:48.117 --> 02:49.684
Want some lambi?

02:49.752 --> 02:52.020
A little too spicy
for most tourists,

02:52.087 --> 02:54.789
but if you get past the heat,
it's delicious.

02:54.857 --> 02:56.758
Better have your girlfriend
on standby, though,

02:56.825 --> 02:58.359
'cause this stuff
gets you revved up.

02:58.427 --> 02:59.761
You know what?
I'm good. I'm good, thanks.

02:59.828 --> 03:02.563
Here's the time and place
of the auction.

03:06.502 --> 03:07.835
Hey,
before we talk business,

03:07.903 --> 03:09.570
I just have a few questions
about your security.

03:09.638 --> 03:11.339
It's taken care of.

03:11.407 --> 03:13.841
Okay. That's -- that's --
that's good to hear.

03:13.909 --> 03:16.244
I just need to know
what that means.

03:16.312 --> 03:18.646
Do I look stupid to you?

03:18.714 --> 03:20.615
You don't think
I know the same people

03:20.683 --> 03:22.650
who would pay for the list
would kill for it?

03:22.718 --> 03:24.419
You don't think
I've taken precautions?

03:24.486 --> 03:25.987
I'm sure you have.

03:26.055 --> 03:28.289
I need to be certain that
they're sufficient. That's all.

03:28.357 --> 03:30.525
Well, you don't have to
worry about it.

03:30.592 --> 03:32.026
Actually, I kind of do.

03:32.094 --> 03:34.395
Worrying is part of
my job description.

03:34.463 --> 03:36.130
I worry about things.
I don't know.

03:36.198 --> 03:38.066
What if someone
were to be sitting outside

03:38.133 --> 03:39.567
wherever
you got this list,

03:39.635 --> 03:42.337
just waiting for the deal
to go down?

03:42.404 --> 03:44.405
Okay, well, <i>that's</i> not possible,
'cause it's always moving.

03:44.473 --> 03:47.809
I'm not gonna
jump through hoops here.

03:47.876 --> 03:50.712
You want in,
it's on my terms.

03:50.779 --> 03:52.780
There's got plenty of buyers
to choose from.

03:52.848 --> 03:54.115
There's only one list.

03:54.183 --> 03:57.485
And anyone trying to help
themselves to it is dead.

04:14.269 --> 04:15.970
<i>Por favor.</i>

04:19.908 --> 04:21.809
Well, you don't
look very happy.

04:21.877 --> 04:23.378
Well --
<i>gracias.</i>

04:23.445 --> 04:25.146
If my guess is right, Walsh just
said he's using a moving loop

04:25.214 --> 04:26.280
to keep the list
out of harm's way.

04:26.348 --> 04:27.749
Well,
that tells us something.

04:27.816 --> 04:29.016
If it's on a 24/7 relay,

04:29.084 --> 04:30.518
then they're
using motorcycles.

04:30.586 --> 04:33.121
They're all over the town,
they can't get stuck in traffic,

04:33.188 --> 04:34.756
and they're just
handing that list

04:34.823 --> 04:36.290
from one rider
over to the next,

04:36.358 --> 04:37.892
and they don't stop
until it's sold.

04:37.960 --> 04:40.695
I got to tell you,
I'm impressed.

04:40.763 --> 04:42.263
You're <i>impressed?</i>
<i>You should be upset.</i>

04:42.331 --> 04:43.664
Sam,
we can't hit the list

04:43.732 --> 04:45.500
if we don't know where it is
or when it's gonna be there.

04:45.567 --> 04:47.702
Nobody said stealing
the list would be easy,

04:47.770 --> 04:48.903
but we can make it work.

04:48.971 --> 04:50.638
We just need
to make some new buddies.

04:50.706 --> 04:52.974
My specialty.

05:08.428 --> 05:10.329
Hey!
What's up, Big Brother?

05:10.397 --> 05:12.367
<i>...Especially when it means</i>
<i>playing chaperone</i>

05:12.435 --> 05:13.870

05:13.937 --> 05:15.472
Oh, yeah. Sorry, man.

05:15.540 --> 05:17.541
Hey, you're looking better
than I expected.

05:17.609 --> 05:19.143
Mom told me about, uh,
you getting shot.

05:19.210 --> 05:20.444
I heard
it was pretty serious.

05:20.511 --> 05:25.550
Yeah, I'm better. So why
the last-minute trip home?

05:25.618 --> 05:27.686
Yeah, well, there's mom,
you know. You.

05:27.754 --> 05:29.454
People I love
and I want to see.

05:29.522 --> 05:30.823
What's wrong with that?

05:30.890 --> 05:32.991
You booked a ticket
on one day's notice

05:33.059 --> 05:34.393
without any luggage.

05:34.460 --> 05:37.362
I'm figuring it's more than
just a family reunion, Nate.

05:37.430 --> 05:38.497
Fine.

05:38.564 --> 05:39.831
This buddy of mine,

05:39.899 --> 05:41.900
he owns a custom car shop
with his brother.

05:41.967 --> 05:44.536
They got hit a couple days ago.
They lost three cars.

05:44.603 --> 05:47.373
You flew back home just
to track down some stolen cars?

05:47.441 --> 05:50.043
These guys know I got contacts
in that arena.

05:50.111 --> 05:51.779
It's gonna be easy.
What is that look for?

05:51.847 --> 05:53.447
Don't they
have insurance?

05:53.515 --> 05:55.750
Look, it's good money,
they're friends.

05:55.818 --> 05:56.951
That's it. I swear.

05:57.019 --> 05:59.721
It's on the way, bro.

05:59.789 --> 06:01.925
Stop looking at me
like that.

06:06.698 --> 06:08.800
Oh-ho-ho.

06:08.868 --> 06:10.536
Nice!

06:10.603 --> 06:13.906
Hey, I wonder if they'll let me
roll the El Camino.

06:19.714 --> 06:21.348
How could you
do this to us?!

06:21.416 --> 06:23.618
Jeff? Billy! Hey!

06:23.685 --> 06:24.652
Stop it!

06:30.926 --> 06:32.794
That's enough!
Hey! Hey, guys!

06:32.862 --> 06:34.095
Come on! You're family!

06:34.162 --> 06:35.396
What's wrong with you?

06:35.464 --> 06:38.065
I'll tell you what's wrong,
Nate. We're dead men.

06:41.370 --> 06:44.474
You are lucky I did not
break your damn neck!

06:44.541 --> 06:46.376
Jeff, why are you
so heated, man?

06:46.443 --> 06:48.679
It's just
some stolen cars!

06:48.746 --> 06:51.348
It is and it isn't.

06:51.416 --> 06:53.751
Uh, can you elaborate
a bit more?

06:53.819 --> 06:55.753
A few months back,
the shop was in trouble.

06:55.821 --> 06:57.222
We were behind
on the mortgage,

06:57.290 --> 06:58.824
the bills, and everything.

06:58.891 --> 07:00.225
I messed up.

07:00.293 --> 07:02.594
I got into business with
this guy, Hector Rivera.

07:02.662 --> 07:05.697
He's not just a guy!
He's a drug kingpin!

07:05.765 --> 07:08.500
I let him use our cars
to transport his drugs.

07:08.568 --> 07:09.969
One shipment a month.

07:10.037 --> 07:12.204
Supposed to be
a temporary thing.

07:12.272 --> 07:15.274
It's low-risk.
And then we got robbed.

07:15.342 --> 07:17.042
And one of the stolen cars

07:17.110 --> 07:19.011
was loaded
with Rivera's drugs.

07:19.946 --> 07:21.046
How much?

07:21.114 --> 07:22.515
20 kilos of heroin.

07:22.582 --> 07:23.783
What?!

07:23.851 --> 07:25.051
And -- and you're telling me
this now?

07:25.119 --> 07:26.453
Don't feel bad, Nate.

07:26.521 --> 07:27.755
I'm just finding out, too,
and that's my brother.

07:27.822 --> 07:29.823
What were you thinking,
man?

07:29.891 --> 07:31.259
I-I was desperate.

07:31.327 --> 07:33.728
Look, this shop's been
in our family for 46 years.

07:33.796 --> 07:36.465
O-our grandfather built it,
passed it on to our dad.

07:36.533 --> 07:38.234
And now it's ours.

07:38.301 --> 07:40.036
Look, I didn't want
our generation

07:40.104 --> 07:41.538
to be the one to lose it.

07:41.606 --> 07:43.841
Look, I get it, Billy.
You did it for a good reason.

07:43.908 --> 07:45.309
Hooray for you.

07:45.377 --> 07:47.711
But that doesn't get us a pass
when Rivera shows up.

07:47.779 --> 07:49.213
He is still
going to kill us.

07:49.281 --> 07:50.381
Not if you find the car.

07:50.449 --> 07:51.983
How long
till he comes looking?

07:52.051 --> 07:55.087
I can probably hold him off
for another day, maybe two.

07:55.155 --> 07:56.656
Okay, well, it's not a lot
of time, but it can be done.

07:56.723 --> 07:58.758
I'll find your car.

08:01.829 --> 08:03.029
Nate.

08:03.097 --> 08:04.564
Can I talk to you a second?

08:04.632 --> 08:05.766
Oh, yeah, sure.

08:08.603 --> 08:09.771
Look, I swear to God,

08:09.838 --> 08:11.740
I didn't know
about the drugs, all right?

08:11.807 --> 08:13.041
But don't worry about it.

08:13.109 --> 08:15.277
I'm not trying
to rope you into this, okay?

08:15.345 --> 08:16.712
I'll figure
it out myself.

08:16.780 --> 08:18.314
No, I don't want you
to figure it out.

08:18.382 --> 08:19.482
You're not taking the job.

08:19.550 --> 08:20.683
Yes, I am.

08:20.751 --> 08:22.351
Nate, you're not just
looking for a car.

08:22.419 --> 08:24.353
It's full of dope. You need to
tell them to get out of town now.

08:24.421 --> 08:26.088
And I mean right now.
Then what?

08:26.156 --> 08:28.023
They gonna run
for the rest of their lives?

08:28.091 --> 08:29.825
Come on, Mike.
These guys got families.

08:29.892 --> 08:31.293
They should have
thought about that

08:31.360 --> 08:33.126
when they got into bed
with Rivera.

08:33.195 --> 08:35.563
Hey. You know what it's like to
have a screw-up for a brother.

08:35.631 --> 08:39.601
I'm taking the job -- I mean,
with or without your help.

08:41.169 --> 08:43.438
All right. I'll call Fi.

09:00.025 --> 09:01.926
Here's the three cars
they swiped.

09:04.229 --> 09:07.464
Which one of these
had the drugs in it?

09:07.532 --> 09:08.832
1969 G.T.O..

09:08.900 --> 09:10.868
God, she's pretty.

09:10.936 --> 09:13.036
You boys ready
for show and tell?

09:14.605 --> 09:17.506
Your friends were hit
by a top-notch crew.

09:17.574 --> 09:19.942
I checked
the surveillance footage.

09:20.010 --> 09:21.143
Nothing.

09:21.211 --> 09:23.145
They used laser strobes
to blind the cameras

09:23.213 --> 09:25.081
and a plasma torch
to cut through the gates.

09:25.148 --> 09:26.582
And to top it off,

09:26.650 --> 09:29.819
Billy said they put a sedative
in his poor dogs' puppy chow.

09:29.887 --> 09:31.488
Drugs, lasers,
and plasma torches?

09:31.556 --> 09:33.657
You make it sound like
they threw a rave in here.

09:33.725 --> 09:36.393
The list of crews working
in this level in Miami

09:36.461 --> 09:38.062
is likely to be
very short.

09:38.130 --> 09:42.033
Fi, I'm thinking I should
talk to Tony Soto.

09:42.101 --> 09:43.268
W-wait, what?

09:43.336 --> 09:46.205
I did some business
a while back

09:46.272 --> 09:48.674
with a guy who ran Miami's
biggest auto-theft ring.

09:48.741 --> 09:50.275
No, I know who Tony Soto is.
He --

09:50.343 --> 09:52.243
I just -- I didn't know that
he was friends with my brother.

09:52.311 --> 09:54.145
We're not exactly
"friends."

09:54.213 --> 09:57.081
And Soto doesn't exactly
know him as "Michael."

09:57.149 --> 09:59.150
<i>Re-establishing</i>
<i>an old cover I.D.</i>

09:59.218 --> 10:01.485
<i>Isn't just a matter</i>
<i>of changing your name.</i>

10:01.552 --> 10:02.753
<i>If you want access</i>

10:02.820 --> 10:04.421
<i>to the contacts</i>
<i>that go with that cover,</i>

10:04.489 --> 10:06.757
<i>you have to re-create the past.</i>

10:06.825 --> 10:08.926
<i>The way you walk, talk,</i>
<i>and look</i>

10:08.993 --> 10:10.694
<i>has to be consistent</i>
<i>with what people remember</i>

10:10.762 --> 10:13.364
<i>down to the smallest detail --</i>

10:13.431 --> 10:16.534
<i>the direction you part</i>
<i>your hair, what gun you carry,</i>

10:16.601 --> 10:18.603
<i>your brand of sunglasses,</i>

10:18.670 --> 10:21.039
<i>even the pinky ring you wear.</i>

10:23.575 --> 10:25.677
What the hell
is going on here?

10:27.446 --> 10:29.815
I -- I got to help
some friends, ma.

10:29.882 --> 10:31.784
And you have to dress like
a funeral director?

10:31.851 --> 10:34.220
Come on, mom.
The suits were Mike's idea.

10:34.288 --> 10:37.590
This "helping" you're doing
isn't dangerous, is it, Nate?

10:37.658 --> 10:40.093
No. I'm just gonna
find a car.

10:40.161 --> 10:41.561
Mm-hmm.

10:41.629 --> 10:44.330
I'm holding you responsible
for keeping him out of trouble.

10:44.397 --> 10:45.531
Mom, he's a grown man.

10:45.599 --> 10:46.665
You're still
his Big Brother!

10:46.733 --> 10:48.733
Okay.
I will look out for him.

10:48.801 --> 10:49.901
You ready?
Yeah.

10:49.969 --> 10:51.402
Wait!

10:51.470 --> 10:54.038
If my boys
are dressing up...

10:54.106 --> 10:55.539
I want to take a picture.

10:55.607 --> 10:57.308
Mom, we don't
have time for --

11:03.949 --> 11:05.817
Keep the car
running. I won't be long.

11:16.296 --> 11:19.399
Well, well.
Smooth-talking Johnny.

11:19.467 --> 11:23.169
What do you say, Tony?
Long time.

11:23.237 --> 11:24.637
What brings you
back to Miami?

11:24.705 --> 11:27.373
Looking for a car.

11:27.441 --> 11:30.843
Custom shop on Barton Ave.
Got hit the other day.

11:30.911 --> 11:33.212
The crew used laser strobes,
plasma torches.

11:33.279 --> 11:34.512
How many cars they get?

11:34.580 --> 11:35.880
Three in total,

11:35.948 --> 11:39.950
including a sweet '69 G.T.O.
That was just my size.

11:40.018 --> 11:42.886
Somebody stuck their finger
in the wrong pie.

11:42.954 --> 11:45.856
I'm not mad. I just want
to get my ride back.

11:45.924 --> 11:48.559
Mm.

11:50.462 --> 11:54.031
I got an idea
who you're talking about.

11:54.099 --> 11:56.166
My guy's gonna confirm.

11:56.233 --> 11:57.934
I appreciate it.

11:58.002 --> 11:59.502
How's tricks?

11:59.570 --> 12:01.137
Mm, better than ever.

12:01.205 --> 12:04.974
Have you heard what a BMW 750
goes for in China these days?

12:05.042 --> 12:06.241
Mm.

12:06.309 --> 12:07.709
Actually, I could use
a crew like yours

12:07.777 --> 12:08.911
if you're looking for work.

12:08.978 --> 12:11.246
Sorry.
My dance card is full.

12:12.816 --> 12:15.717
Hmm.

12:19.689 --> 12:21.856
The crew that hit
that custom shop

12:21.924 --> 12:23.892
is run by a guy
called Buckwild.

12:23.959 --> 12:25.794
He's not on my good side.

12:25.862 --> 12:28.296
That's the address
to his chop shop.

12:30.734 --> 12:32.201
Here's the thing,
Johnny --

12:32.269 --> 12:34.137
you take that information,

12:34.204 --> 12:37.240
and I'm gonna need
a little favor in return.

12:37.308 --> 12:40.210
As I recall, you enjoy
destroying things.

12:40.278 --> 12:42.179
Once you're done
with your business,

12:42.246 --> 12:44.347
I want you to do
some Johnny-style damage

12:44.415 --> 12:45.381
on that chop shop.

12:45.449 --> 12:47.050
Put it out of commission.

12:50.154 --> 12:52.488
A deal's a deal.

12:55.325 --> 12:57.293
Johnny's back.

13:01.331 --> 13:03.164
What took so long?

13:03.232 --> 13:05.000
Can't rush a guy
like Tony Soto.

13:05.067 --> 13:06.502
Billy called three times.

13:06.569 --> 13:08.303
Rivera's on his way
to their shop.

13:15.847 --> 13:16.914
Where's my car?

13:20.218 --> 13:21.318
It was stolen.

13:21.386 --> 13:23.421
I swear, I don't
know where it is.

13:23.489 --> 13:24.856
Ugh!

13:35.168 --> 13:36.902
Sorry, guys.
They're closed.

13:36.970 --> 13:38.937
We're not customers.

13:39.005 --> 13:39.971
Then who the hell
are you?

13:40.039 --> 13:41.106
The name's Johnny.

13:41.173 --> 13:42.974
I hear
you're looking for a car.

13:43.042 --> 13:44.876
I'm the guy
who's gonna find it.

13:44.944 --> 13:47.311
And I'm the guy who's gonna help
the guy who's gonna find it.

13:47.379 --> 13:50.247
Do we look
like we need help?

13:50.315 --> 13:54.652
Easy. We're car guys.
I used to steal. Now I find.

13:54.719 --> 13:57.221
The Taylor brothers
hired me.

13:57.289 --> 14:00.224
You put our business
in the street?

14:00.292 --> 14:02.393
They took initiative
to make up for a mistake.

14:02.461 --> 14:04.495
You're a businessman.
You can appreciate that.

14:04.563 --> 14:06.597
How do you plan
on finding my car?

14:06.665 --> 14:09.567
I already have the name
of the thief who took it.

14:09.635 --> 14:12.003
I'm gonna find him
and ask for it back...

14:12.070 --> 14:15.740
As soon as your dog
stops barking at me.

14:15.807 --> 14:16.774
No, no.

14:16.842 --> 14:18.642
Give the man some room,
Caleb.

14:20.011 --> 14:24.215
If you're as good
as you seem to think you are,

14:24.282 --> 14:27.818
I'd say 24 hours
is enough time.

14:27.886 --> 14:30.187
Do I look
like I need more?

14:31.556 --> 14:35.258
But I can't trust somebody
I don't know, so...

14:35.326 --> 14:38.328
You don't make a move unless my
boy Caleb is there to see it.

14:38.396 --> 14:40.363
The cheerleader can come.
Bring your pom-poms.

14:43.634 --> 14:44.935
One more thing.

14:45.002 --> 14:47.772
Just to make sure
you're sufficiently motivated...

14:50.743 --> 14:52.644
...I keep him
until it's done.

14:52.712 --> 14:54.847
Wait! Take me.
It's my fault.

14:58.785 --> 15:00.620
Suit yourself.

15:03.490 --> 15:06.025
Clock is ticking.

15:13.144 --> 15:15.245
<i>You don't always have to rely</i>
<i>on trained operatives</i>

15:15.344 --> 15:16.711
<i>to gather intelligence.</i>

15:16.779 --> 15:18.846
<i>A problem</i>
<i>that seems impossible --</i>

15:18.914 --> 15:20.715
<i>like finding</i>
<i>a single motorcycle</i>

15:20.783 --> 15:22.483
<i>circling in a crowded city --</i>

15:22.538 --> 15:25.206
<i>becomes much easier</i>
<i>if you can hire 100 people</i>

15:25.274 --> 15:26.875
<i>to sit on street corners</i>

15:26.942 --> 15:29.144
<i>and record every motorcycle</i>
<i>they see</i>

15:29.211 --> 15:30.845
<i>for a few dollars a day.</i>

15:30.913 --> 15:33.214
<i>Whether it's shop owners,</i>
<i>cab drivers,</i>

15:33.282 --> 15:35.116
<i>or kids playing in the street,</i>

15:35.184 --> 15:38.286
<i>every city in the world has</i>
<i>a network of potential spies</i>

15:38.354 --> 15:39.954
<i>just waiting</i>
<i>to be recruited.</i>

15:52.635 --> 15:55.103
So how's our new crew
of field operatives looking?

15:55.171 --> 15:57.172
We've got the downtown area
locked down.

15:57.239 --> 15:59.507
Any motorcycle comes
through here more than once,

15:59.575 --> 16:00.809
we'll know about it.

16:00.876 --> 16:02.944
We still have money
for beer left.

16:04.647 --> 16:06.247
You talk to Mike?

16:06.315 --> 16:07.549
No.

16:07.616 --> 16:09.351
We're gonna let him
take it easy on this one.

16:09.418 --> 16:10.885
He could use a break.
Yeah.

16:12.621 --> 16:13.922
Nate,
take the jacket off.

16:13.989 --> 16:15.156
You're not going with us
this time.

16:15.224 --> 16:16.458
Oh, okay. I see.

16:16.525 --> 16:18.360
I can drive you to a meeting.
That's fine.

16:18.427 --> 16:19.694
But I can't go with you

16:19.762 --> 16:21.896
to get the car
that I was hired to recover.

16:21.964 --> 16:24.532
Not when we're walking into
a location full of unknowns.

16:24.600 --> 16:26.835
Tony said Buckwild's crew
is a handful.

16:26.902 --> 16:28.269
That's my point.

16:28.337 --> 16:31.506
And don't forget, he told you
to level the place.

16:31.574 --> 16:33.208
You could use the help.

16:33.275 --> 16:35.276
Nate's right. With Sam and Jesse
out of town --

16:36.612 --> 16:38.246
Nate, you forgot
your sandwich!

16:44.653 --> 16:47.222
Michael, may I ask
what you boys are up to?

16:47.289 --> 16:49.524
Nothing, mom.

16:49.592 --> 16:50.959
Just, um...Mmm.

16:53.896 --> 16:55.463
Excuse me.

16:57.466 --> 17:00.568
They're only loaded
with bean-bag rounds.

17:01.871 --> 17:03.338
It's not Mike's fault.

17:03.406 --> 17:05.440
I got him
into this one.

17:05.508 --> 17:07.474
Nate, Fiona,
would you excuse me

17:07.542 --> 17:09.477
and give me a moment
with Michael, please?

17:16.385 --> 17:18.086
You may be too old
for me to spank,

17:18.154 --> 17:19.820
but I'll say this --

17:19.888 --> 17:21.790
your brother gets hurt,

17:21.857 --> 17:25.093
and I'm putting one of these out
in your eye.

17:26.494 --> 17:27.595
Understood?

17:27.663 --> 17:30.632
Understood.

17:34.703 --> 17:36.971
They use that garage
as the chop shop.

17:37.039 --> 17:38.673
Belongs to
a guy named Buckwild.

17:38.741 --> 17:40.341
And our car's in there?

17:40.409 --> 17:41.976
We're about to find out.

17:44.380 --> 17:45.814
Slow down, Caleb.

17:45.881 --> 17:48.950
The deal was you got to
congratulate, not participate.

17:49.018 --> 17:52.020
I do this my way
with my crew.

17:52.087 --> 17:54.789
Johnny boy, long as we get
the car back, I'm good.

18:01.230 --> 18:03.565
<i>Sometimes the best way</i>
<i>to get past security</i>

18:03.632 --> 18:05.834
<i>is to make it seem riskier</i>
<i>to keep you out</i>

18:05.901 --> 18:07.435
<i>than it is to let you in.</i>

18:07.503 --> 18:09.070
Hey, what do you think
you're doing, lady?

18:09.138 --> 18:11.473
I nicked this baby
off Biscayne.

18:11.540 --> 18:12.907
Buckwild said
to drop it here.

18:12.975 --> 18:14.209
I need to get it
off the street

18:14.276 --> 18:15.510
before it turns
into a Pumpkin.

18:15.578 --> 18:17.111
All right. Give me --
give me a minute, all right?

18:17.179 --> 18:19.113
<i>The average security guard</i>

18:19.181 --> 18:21.082
<i>won't risk</i>
<i>angering someone important.</i>

18:21.150 --> 18:22.884
<i>At an illegal chop shop,</i>

18:22.952 --> 18:26.020
<i>the lady in the $90,000</i>
<i>stolen car is a V.I.P.</i>

18:26.088 --> 18:28.289
Come on. Hurry up.

18:28.357 --> 18:30.758
Good news, boys.
It's quittin' time.

18:30.826 --> 18:31.960
Aah!

18:32.027 --> 18:34.229
Who the hell
are these guys?

18:34.296 --> 18:37.899
It doesn't matter who we are.
It matters what we want.

18:37.967 --> 18:41.402
I see a Camaro and a
Mercedes. Guess what's missing.

18:41.470 --> 18:44.439
You stole three cars
from Taylor & Sons.

18:44.507 --> 18:46.975
Prize goes to whoever
tells us where the G.T.O. is.

18:54.783 --> 18:57.852
Maybe we should be
more specific about the prize.

18:57.920 --> 19:02.323
The winner gets to be <i>outside</i>
<i>when this place burns.</i>

19:02.391 --> 19:04.292
Wait, wait, wait!
Buckwild has it!

19:04.360 --> 19:06.494
He said he already
had a buyer lined up!

19:06.562 --> 19:07.996
We got a winner.

19:08.063 --> 19:09.364
Bonus round.

19:09.431 --> 19:12.700
Tell me where I can find
this Buckwild.

19:23.312 --> 19:24.946
What happened?
Where's the car?

19:25.014 --> 19:26.648
We got an idea
where to find it.

19:26.715 --> 19:28.149
What the hell
did you do in there?

19:28.217 --> 19:29.217
What did we do?

19:32.855 --> 19:34.556
<i>That's</i> what we did.
Now let's go.

19:34.623 --> 19:36.057
I got another
stop to make.

19:45.534 --> 19:47.468
That's the house.
Remember the deal.

19:47.536 --> 19:49.437
You sit tight
while I go talk to Buckwild.

19:49.505 --> 19:50.605
Not this time.

19:50.673 --> 19:51.906
This guy stole
my boss's car,

19:51.974 --> 19:53.708
I want to hear what
he has to say. I'm going.

19:53.776 --> 19:55.643
Fine,
but you follow <i>my</i> lead.

19:55.711 --> 19:57.979
Whatever you say,
Johnny boy.

20:09.592 --> 20:10.692
Hey, man!

20:18.867 --> 20:21.536
It's gonna be kind of hard
to question a dead man.

20:21.604 --> 20:23.671
Stupid son of a bitch
tried to shoot me.

20:23.739 --> 20:24.806
Left me no choice.

20:24.873 --> 20:27.408
I'm getting the hell
out of here.

20:27.476 --> 20:29.477
This wasn't self-defense,
Michael.

20:29.545 --> 20:31.579
Caleb's been
in this house before.

20:31.647 --> 20:33.414
He came straight back here.
He knew where this room was.

20:33.482 --> 20:36.517
Safety's on.

20:36.585 --> 20:39.053
So Caleb stole Rivera's car
and the drugs,

20:39.121 --> 20:41.990
and he's letting the Taylors
take the fall for it.

20:42.057 --> 20:44.759
Too bad the only one
who can prove that is dead.

20:49.576 --> 20:51.744
<i>Intelligence gathering</i>
<i>tends to involve</i>

20:51.812 --> 20:53.346
<i>a lot of number crunching.</i>

20:53.414 --> 20:56.149
<i>Analysts have computers</i>
<i>specially programmed</i>

20:56.216 --> 20:58.885
<i>to turn raw data</i>
<i>into useful information.</i>

20:58.953 --> 21:01.754
<i>But as with repairing a radio</i>
<i>or dressing a wound,</i>

21:01.822 --> 21:05.058
<i>in the field, it's important</i>
<i>to be able to do the same work</i>

21:05.125 --> 21:09.462
<i>with what you can find</i>
<i>in a third-rate hotel room.</i>

21:09.530 --> 21:11.898
Well, my gal Gabriela
makes a mean cafecito,

21:11.966 --> 21:14.200
but she's got to work
on her handwriting.

21:14.268 --> 21:16.402
So this is it -- the last
of the intelligence reports.

21:16.470 --> 21:18.404
Every motorcycle that passed
in the last 12 hours.

21:18.472 --> 21:19.605
Shh...

21:19.673 --> 21:20.940
What? Here you go.

21:21.008 --> 21:22.208
Okay, hold on.
Let me...

21:22.276 --> 21:25.812
Okay, please tell me she saw
a red dirt bike,

21:25.879 --> 21:27.714
license plate 197-235.

21:27.781 --> 21:30.149
Bam! What? I got you!
You said it couldn't be done!

21:30.217 --> 21:31.851
You doubted me, but I got you.
Now what, huh?

21:31.919 --> 21:32.986
Hmm?

21:33.053 --> 21:34.687
Uh, Jesse, hey.
Can I get an invite?

21:34.755 --> 21:36.289
To what?
To the party in your head.

21:36.357 --> 21:37.490
Yes, you may. Okay.

21:37.558 --> 21:39.125
Most of these
motorbike sightings

21:39.193 --> 21:40.493
have been random, right?
Right.

21:40.561 --> 21:42.895
Guys doing drops-offs,
pick-ups.

21:42.963 --> 21:46.199
But these two are doing loops --
alternating.

21:46.266 --> 21:48.267
Every four hours.
Brrroop!

21:48.335 --> 21:50.169
Every four hours.
They stop for gas here.

21:50.237 --> 21:52.138
That's probably
where they make the switch.

21:52.206 --> 21:53.740
The best place
to intercept the list

21:53.807 --> 21:54.741
would be right there.

21:54.808 --> 21:55.908
That's the best place?

21:55.976 --> 21:57.443
It's downtown.
I know, it's gnarly,

21:57.511 --> 21:59.078
but that's the only place
they go off the main streets.

21:59.146 --> 22:00.513
And this back alley here --

22:00.581 --> 22:02.181
tailor-made
for springing a trap.

22:02.249 --> 22:04.984
Come on, now!
Come on, give it to me, man!

22:05.052 --> 22:07.153
Come on, now!

22:07.221 --> 22:09.589
I guess we're not talking about
a two-man job anymore, are we?

22:09.656 --> 22:11.124
No. How soon do you think
Mike and Fi can get down here?

22:11.191 --> 22:12.392
At least a day.

22:12.459 --> 22:15.628
Fi said Mike's family time
got a little "hectic."

22:15.696 --> 22:17.930
You're telling me that Caleb hired
a thief to steal the car for him,

22:17.998 --> 22:19.966
and then he killed him
right there in front of you?

22:20.034 --> 22:22.535
Well, not <i>right</i> in front of me,
but basically.

22:22.603 --> 22:24.337
Look, I know
it sounds bad --

22:24.405 --> 22:25.605
well,
it -- it <i>is</i> bad,

22:25.672 --> 22:27.006
but it's not as bad
as you're thinking.

22:27.074 --> 22:30.276
I got to go talk to Rivera

22:30.344 --> 22:33.513
and tell him that Caleb
stole the drugs and the car.

22:33.580 --> 22:35.948
That's not a good idea.
We still have plenty of time.

22:36.016 --> 22:38.051
How is 17 hours
plenty of time?

22:38.118 --> 22:40.019
I'm not just
gonna stand here

22:40.087 --> 22:42.622
and let Caleb
run the time out on Billy!

22:42.689 --> 22:44.457
Listen to me.
Listen to me!

22:44.525 --> 22:47.326
I know you want to help.
I <i>know</i> you love your brother.

22:47.394 --> 22:50.229
But if it's your word
against Caleb, you will lose.

22:50.297 --> 22:51.364
And so will Billy.

22:53.634 --> 22:55.501
He did it for me.

22:55.569 --> 22:58.671
The deal he made with Rivera,
he did it for <i>me.</i>

22:58.739 --> 23:01.340
I thought
you didn't know about it.

23:01.408 --> 23:03.776
I-I didn't <i>want</i>
<i>to know about it.</i>

23:03.844 --> 23:06.145
Look, I got sick
about a year ago,

23:06.213 --> 23:07.413
and the doctor bills --

23:07.481 --> 23:09.649
they sucked up every cent
we made and then some.

23:09.716 --> 23:11.818
And Billy told me
just to focus on getting well

23:11.885 --> 23:14.087
and not to worry
about taking care of the shop.

23:14.154 --> 23:17.290
And I never once asked him
where he got the money from.

23:17.357 --> 23:19.459
Now you're telling me
when he needs my help,

23:19.526 --> 23:20.927
there's nothing
that we can do?

23:20.994 --> 23:22.095
There's a lot we can do.

23:22.162 --> 23:23.663
Look, we know that Caleb
stole the car.

23:23.730 --> 23:25.198
All we got to do now
is prove it.

23:25.265 --> 23:27.166
Right? We're gonna
break into his place,

23:27.234 --> 23:29.769
and we're gonna find something
that's gonna lead us to it.

23:29.837 --> 23:31.104
What if we don't?

23:31.171 --> 23:34.507
Worst case, we go in hard,
and we get Billy.

23:34.575 --> 23:36.609
And then
we're on the run?

23:36.677 --> 23:39.011
Like I said --
worst case.

24:01.368 --> 24:03.402
Caleb's got two guys with guns
in the front of the house.

24:03.470 --> 24:04.637
What does it
look like here?

24:04.705 --> 24:05.872
It's wide open.

24:05.939 --> 24:07.140
We're just waiting
for Caleb to leave.

24:07.207 --> 24:09.509
But you guys are gonna
have to search without me.

24:09.576 --> 24:10.743
Why? What's going on?

24:10.811 --> 24:12.311
Got a text message
from Hector Rivera.

24:12.379 --> 24:13.446
He wants me at his house
for a meeting.

24:13.514 --> 24:15.248
Uh-oh.

24:15.315 --> 24:18.251
Looks like Rivera wants Caleb
and Billy at that meeting.

24:18.318 --> 24:20.520
I can't imagine
this is good news.

24:20.587 --> 24:23.089
I'm gonna see what's up,
but the plan doesn't change.

24:23.157 --> 24:25.091
The only chance we have
of helping Billy

24:25.159 --> 24:26.759
is to prove
Caleb stole the car.

24:26.827 --> 24:28.427
You guys
have to get in there

24:28.495 --> 24:29.962
and find
something we can use.

24:49.650 --> 24:52.251
Hey. Right on time.

24:52.319 --> 24:54.287
If I had known
it was a pool party,

24:54.354 --> 24:55.821
I would have brought
my floaties.

24:55.889 --> 24:58.291
Don't worry, Johnny.

24:58.358 --> 25:00.393
You're not going swimming.

25:00.460 --> 25:02.695
So what am I
right on time for?

25:02.763 --> 25:04.964
Gonna take a little trip.
I've been doing a little looking of my own, Johnny.

25:05.032 --> 25:08.367
Heard from a source.
He says that he found the G.T.O.

25:08.435 --> 25:11.771
This is my happy face.

25:11.838 --> 25:14.707
Figure you might want to be
there when we go to get it.

25:17.244 --> 25:19.412
Let me call off my people.

25:19.479 --> 25:23.115
No use searching for a car
that's already been found.

25:23.183 --> 25:25.251
Nothing but bad paintings
and tacky furniture

25:25.319 --> 25:26.552
in the rest
of the house.

25:26.620 --> 25:27.787
You find anything?

25:27.854 --> 25:29.555
No, but he's definitely
hiding something.

25:29.623 --> 25:32.024
I found a bunch of shredded
documents over there.

25:32.092 --> 25:33.693
It's just -- I can't get past these
encrypted files.

25:33.760 --> 25:35.228
Michael, what's up?

25:35.295 --> 25:37.597
Time to pull the plug,
people.

25:37.664 --> 25:39.832
Sounds like
the car turned up.

25:39.900 --> 25:41.367
Turned up where?

25:41.435 --> 25:45.338
I don't know, but Caleb's
taking us to it right now.

25:45.405 --> 25:46.872
They found the car.
Caleb's taking them to it.

25:46.940 --> 25:48.241
It's a setup.

25:48.308 --> 25:49.976
How much you want to bet me
that Caleb put that car

25:50.043 --> 25:51.177
somewhere
that makes it look

25:51.245 --> 25:52.411
like the brothers
double-crossed Rivera.

25:52.479 --> 25:54.413
That's why he's bringing
Michael and Billy.

25:54.481 --> 25:56.215
They get there,
Rivera sees the car.

25:56.283 --> 25:58.417
We've got to figure out
where they're headed.

25:58.485 --> 25:59.919
How?! We looked everywhere!

25:59.987 --> 26:01.754
And they shredded
everything.

26:01.822 --> 26:05.424
<i>Any security-conscious person</i>
<i>knows to protect their computer</i>

26:05.492 --> 26:06.892
<i>and shred their documents.</i>

26:06.960 --> 26:08.594
<i>They tend to forget, though,</i>

26:08.662 --> 26:11.397
<i>about the step between computer</i>
<i>and hard copy.</i>

26:11.465 --> 26:14.767
<i>Most printers store documents</i>
<i>in their memory.</i>

26:14.835 --> 26:17.970
<i>It's a convenient way for users</i>
<i>to print another copy</i>

26:18.038 --> 26:20.740
<i>and a convenient way for spies</i>
<i>to steal information.</i>

26:20.807 --> 26:23.342
He printed a rental agreement
for a storage unit.

26:23.410 --> 26:24.610
It's in Billy's name.

26:24.678 --> 26:25.511
Where?

26:25.579 --> 26:26.679
Dania Beach.

26:26.747 --> 26:28.047
If they're leaving
from Rivera's place,

26:28.115 --> 26:29.782
they've got
a five-minute head start.

26:29.850 --> 26:31.784
But they don't know
it's a race.

26:58.912 --> 27:00.546
She's in there.

27:00.614 --> 27:02.415
We're gonna
have to set up an ambush.

27:02.482 --> 27:03.783
Can't you pick the lock?

27:03.850 --> 27:05.384
Well...Yeah,
of course I can,

27:05.452 --> 27:07.887
but Rivera and his guys
are gonna be here any minute.

27:07.954 --> 27:09.955
We'll never get the car out
in time.

27:10.023 --> 27:11.757
Fi, there's not a lot of things I
can do better than my brother,

27:11.825 --> 27:13.526
but hot-wiring a car
is one of them.

27:13.593 --> 27:14.427
Just get me inside.

27:19.099 --> 27:20.866
<i>Any run-of-the-mill car thief</i>

27:20.934 --> 27:22.902
<i>can hot-wire</i>
<i>a standard vehicle,</i>

27:22.969 --> 27:26.238
<i>but dealing with a custom hot</i>
<i>rod equipped with a kill switch</i>

27:26.306 --> 27:28.207
<i>requires special skills.</i>

27:28.275 --> 27:30.209
<i>Splicing the right wires</i>
<i>together</i>

27:30.277 --> 27:32.845
<i>to create an electrical bypass</i>
<i>takes a seasoned pro.</i>

27:49.596 --> 27:51.430
Right over here.

27:51.498 --> 27:54.500
Last unit on the right.

27:54.568 --> 27:57.837
What's wrong, Billy?
This place look familiar?

27:57.904 --> 27:59.905
I don't understand.
This is my unit.

27:59.973 --> 28:01.874
Ah, so you admit it.
You <i>did</i> steal --

28:01.942 --> 28:03.676
slow it down, Colombo.

28:03.744 --> 28:06.112
The only thing Billy admitted to
is he <i>has</i> a storage unit.

28:06.179 --> 28:07.580
Let's see what's in it.

28:15.489 --> 28:19.058
Caleb,
I don't see my car.

28:20.761 --> 28:22.061
Why are you
wasting my time!?

28:22.129 --> 28:24.530
My sources were good!
They must have moved it somehow!

28:24.598 --> 28:26.599
I-I should kill
both of you!

28:26.666 --> 28:29.101
Not if your boss
still wants to find his car.

28:29.169 --> 28:32.304
We made a deal. I still have
eight hours to play with.

28:32.372 --> 28:35.508
Fine. But if I don't have my car
and my product

28:35.575 --> 28:37.943
when you're done playing,
the Taylors die.

28:39.579 --> 28:41.380
And so do you.

28:43.949 --> 28:45.069
Nothing, man.

28:45.890 --> 28:48.023
That's the last place
the drugs could have been.

28:48.415 --> 28:50.183
Damn it!

28:50.250 --> 28:52.919
Here's what we do --

28:52.986 --> 28:54.087
we, uh...

28:54.154 --> 28:57.690
We put this baby
back together, and...

28:57.758 --> 28:59.726
And we drive it
over to Rivera's.

28:59.793 --> 29:03.362
I doubt Hector Rivera
likes this car enough

29:03.430 --> 29:06.999
to forget about
$2 million worth of heroin.

29:07.067 --> 29:09.001
All right, then we just tell him
what happened.

29:09.069 --> 29:10.236
Right?
Caleb stole the car.

29:10.304 --> 29:12.205
By the time we found it,
the drugs were gone.

29:12.272 --> 29:13.673
It won't matter
what we tell him.

29:13.741 --> 29:15.208
He'll still think
we stole the car.

29:15.275 --> 29:17.744
Look, I get it.
It's a long shot.

29:17.811 --> 29:20.113
But...You got
any better ideas?

29:20.180 --> 29:22.982
Our only play here is to have
Rivera discover this car

29:23.050 --> 29:24.283
on Caleb's property.

29:24.351 --> 29:26.886
I mean,
talk about long shots, Mike.

29:26.954 --> 29:29.355
There's no way we drive
onto his property

29:29.423 --> 29:31.324
without his guards seeing us.

29:31.391 --> 29:33.326
There's an access gate
to the alley in back.

29:33.393 --> 29:34.694
We could walk the car in,

29:34.762 --> 29:36.729
put it right behind
Caleb's greenhouse.

29:36.797 --> 29:40.166
Remember that summer
dad made us rebuild the charger?

29:40.234 --> 29:42.034
Call Jeff.

29:42.102 --> 29:44.270
We need to borrow
some tools.

29:44.338 --> 29:46.906
Michael?!

29:46.974 --> 29:48.241
Mom.

29:48.308 --> 29:50.409
Is your phone broken,
or are you just not answering?

29:50.477 --> 29:51.444
We've been really busy.

29:51.512 --> 29:52.945
So I see.

29:53.013 --> 29:54.881
Nate's out front packing car
pieces on the back of a truck.

29:54.948 --> 29:56.582
Remember that car
we were looking for?

29:56.650 --> 29:57.950
Well, we found it.
Oh, good.

29:58.018 --> 30:00.153
Do you mind telling me why
there's a gun in his pocket

30:00.220 --> 30:01.521
when you promised me --

30:01.588 --> 30:03.256
mom, I really don't
have time for this.

30:03.323 --> 30:04.657
This job?
His idea, not mine.

30:04.725 --> 30:06.225
And, by the way,
you have two sons.

30:06.293 --> 30:08.161
I don't know why you're only
worried about him.

30:08.228 --> 30:09.562
Stop whining.

30:09.630 --> 30:12.532
I worry about
you both, Michael.

30:12.599 --> 30:14.967
But only one of you
is about to be a father.

30:17.304 --> 30:19.906
Nate and Ruth
are having a baby?

30:19.973 --> 30:24.610
Why do you think he was so hot
to fly across the country

30:24.678 --> 30:27.713
he should have told me.
<i>You</i> should have told me!

30:27.781 --> 30:29.615
I promised him
I wouldn't say anything.

30:29.683 --> 30:31.984
But now...

30:32.052 --> 30:33.920
Look, Michael, I-I know
you're never gonna go

30:33.987 --> 30:36.389
for the wife and kids and
the house with a picket fence.

30:36.456 --> 30:41.194
But I think Nate
wants a shot at normal.

30:41.261 --> 30:44.263
I'm not sure
there even is such a thing,

30:44.331 --> 30:45.932
but if he's got a chance,

30:45.999 --> 30:48.334
I <i>don't</i> want him
running around with a gun,

30:48.402 --> 30:50.002
chasing after bad guys!

30:50.070 --> 30:52.939
I get it, mom.

30:53.006 --> 30:54.674
I get it.

30:57.811 --> 30:59.912
If I could do this job
without him, I would.

30:59.980 --> 31:02.548
But I can't.

31:02.616 --> 31:06.052
Could you at least make sure
nothing bad happens to him?

31:17.064 --> 31:19.866
Charity truck.
Nice call, Fi.

31:19.933 --> 31:23.502
Well, we are making
a donation to Caleb.

31:25.639 --> 31:27.607
Hey, bro.

31:27.674 --> 31:29.976
<i>If you're planning on doing</i>
<i>heavy mechanic work</i>

31:30.043 --> 31:31.477
<i>in hostile territory,</i>

31:31.545 --> 31:33.746
<i>it's not enough to make sure</i>
<i>you can't be seen.</i>

31:33.814 --> 31:36.349
<i>You also have to make sure</i>
<i>you can't be heard,</i>

31:36.416 --> 31:38.484
<i>which means</i>
<i>silencing your tools.</i>

31:38.552 --> 31:41.520
<i>It's hard to concentrate on</i>
<i>getting the engine timing right</i>

31:41.588 --> 31:43.322
<i>if you're worried</i>
<i>about getting shot.</i>

31:43.390 --> 31:45.625
<i>In the field,</i>
<i>skill with a wrench</i>

31:45.692 --> 31:48.561
<i>is often just as important</i>
<i>as skill with a gun.</i>

31:48.629 --> 31:50.396
<i>When time isn't on your side,</i>

31:50.464 --> 31:53.466
<i>you can't worry about passing</i>
<i>a government inspection.</i>

31:53.533 --> 31:55.067
<i>But you have to do enough</i>

31:55.135 --> 31:58.104
<i>to make sure</i>
<i>your point gets across.</i>

31:58.171 --> 32:00.206
One hour left.
Time to go.

32:00.274 --> 32:02.708
Not yet, Fi.
We still have too much to do.

32:02.776 --> 32:04.777
Michael,
as much as I like

32:04.845 --> 32:07.246
seeing you all sweaty
and greasy,

32:07.314 --> 32:09.448
Rivera's expecting to see
Johnny. You got to go.

32:09.516 --> 32:10.883
Think you can
finish this?

32:10.951 --> 32:12.285
I already saved your ass
once today.

32:12.352 --> 32:13.286
I can do it again.

32:26.833 --> 32:31.437
For your sake, I hope
you came here in a 1969 G.T.O.

32:31.505 --> 32:32.939
I prefer Chargers,

32:33.006 --> 32:34.206
but I did find your car.

32:34.274 --> 32:35.408
I've heard that once
already today.

32:35.475 --> 32:36.542
Not from me.

32:36.610 --> 32:38.711
When I open my mouth,
I'm right.

32:49.323 --> 32:51.357
This is Caleb's address.

32:51.425 --> 32:53.592
You think this is funny?

32:53.660 --> 32:55.394
Do I look
like I'm laughing?

32:55.462 --> 32:57.697
Caleb stole your car
and your heroin,

32:57.764 --> 32:59.665
tried to pin it
on the Taylors.

33:03.904 --> 33:06.238
You come here
without my car,

33:06.306 --> 33:08.541
without my product...

33:09.376 --> 33:11.911
...And you expect me
to believe this story?

33:11.979 --> 33:13.579
Yes, yes, and no.

33:16.950 --> 33:19.819
In my experience,
show beats tell.

33:19.886 --> 33:23.789
Now, you and I are taking a ride
to Caleb's place.

33:23.857 --> 33:25.057
You're dead.

33:25.125 --> 33:26.993
My men will never --

33:27.060 --> 33:29.528
your men?
Your men are coming with us.

33:29.596 --> 33:31.097
I need somebody to drive.

33:42.209 --> 33:45.277
Ah, just a few more minutes,
and then I'm gonna off you.

33:45.345 --> 33:47.013
Then I'm gonna
off your brother.

33:47.080 --> 33:49.548
And then I'm gonna find
your friend in the suit!

33:49.616 --> 33:51.117
No need
to go looking for me, Caleb.

33:51.184 --> 33:52.718
I made it easy on you.

33:54.254 --> 33:56.889
What the hell is this?

33:56.957 --> 33:59.025
Mr. Rivera
was missing his car,

33:59.092 --> 34:00.726
so I brought him
to it.

34:00.794 --> 34:02.228
What are you
talking about?

34:02.295 --> 34:03.929
I told you
when I met you,

34:03.997 --> 34:05.765
I'm the guy who's gonna
find the car.

34:05.832 --> 34:07.133
I found it.

34:07.200 --> 34:10.036
That's ridiculous.
The car's not here. He's insane.

34:10.103 --> 34:11.536
Maybe I am.

34:11.605 --> 34:14.507
But I can still tell time, and
I got six minutes to make good.

34:14.574 --> 34:18.411
Now, why don't you walk us out
behind the greenhouse?

34:18.478 --> 34:20.413
Nate, they're here.
Hurry up!

34:20.480 --> 34:22.148
I'm going
as fast as I can.

34:24.217 --> 34:25.717
Are you gonna believe me

34:25.786 --> 34:27.719
or a crazy man
with a gun on you?

34:27.788 --> 34:31.590
Fine.
Try this on for size.

34:31.658 --> 34:34.893
If I'm lying, shoot me.

34:36.797 --> 34:39.899
Gladly.

34:41.967 --> 34:43.601
They're coming, Nate!

34:43.670 --> 34:45.036
We have to go!
We're good.

34:45.105 --> 34:46.672
Well,
what about this piece?

34:46.739 --> 34:49.141
I want it to look like
Caleb got the drugs out.

34:49.208 --> 34:50.543
Why are you so nervous?

34:50.610 --> 34:52.678
I'm not nervous!
I'm pissed!

34:52.746 --> 34:56.181
Okay. You want to see?
Let's go see. Come on.

34:56.248 --> 34:58.984
And then I am going to
<i>finish</i> you.

34:59.052 --> 35:02.822
If there's no car,
there's no Johnny.

35:02.889 --> 35:05.391
What the hell?
There's no way!

35:08.762 --> 35:10.930
I thought you said
it wasn't here!

35:10.997 --> 35:12.731
He did this.
Don't you see!

35:12.799 --> 35:14.066
He set me up!

35:14.134 --> 35:15.134
<i>I</i> set <i>you</i> up?

35:15.202 --> 35:16.936
How do you figure that,
Caleb?

35:17.003 --> 35:20.206
I just drove that car through the
front gate, past all your guards?

35:20.273 --> 35:23.709
I'm good. I'm <i>really</i> good.
But I'm not <i>that</i> good.

35:23.777 --> 35:26.378
Hector, I would never
steal from you.

35:26.446 --> 35:28.481
You mean...

35:30.150 --> 35:32.651
You mean
you never will...

35:32.719 --> 35:34.653
Again.

35:36.289 --> 35:37.423
Take him inside.

35:43.663 --> 35:45.764
What about my product?

35:45.832 --> 35:47.233
I said I'd find the car.

35:47.300 --> 35:49.735
You want the drugs,
talk to your boy.

35:54.141 --> 35:56.876
Get Taylor and go.

35:56.943 --> 35:59.011
You don't want to see
what happens next.

36:04.618 --> 36:07.553
Well, I was throwing a hail Mary
when I called you, Nate.

36:07.621 --> 36:09.622
Never thought
it would actually work.

36:09.689 --> 36:11.891
It was a pleasure, Billy.
Just don't make it a habit.

36:11.958 --> 36:13.425
Yeah, no need
to worry about that.

36:13.493 --> 36:15.427
From now on, we do business
the old-fashioned way,

36:15.495 --> 36:17.196
no matter what.

36:18.632 --> 36:22.535
Hey, man, Rivera paid us
for that last car,

36:22.602 --> 36:25.905
said it was a small price to pay
for finding a rat.

36:25.972 --> 36:27.339
You got it.

36:27.407 --> 36:29.341
If you need any work done
on that Charger, give us a call.

36:29.409 --> 36:30.409
We'll treat her
like family.

36:30.477 --> 36:31.877
I might take you up
on that.

36:37.617 --> 36:39.151
So what do you say?

36:39.219 --> 36:41.820
50/50?

36:41.888 --> 36:43.522
No,
why don't you keep it?

36:43.590 --> 36:46.258
You know,
for the baby.

36:50.163 --> 36:52.364
I was gonna tell you.

36:52.432 --> 36:53.866
I wanted to.

36:53.934 --> 36:56.368
But?

36:56.436 --> 37:00.339
I'm still not used to the idea
of being a dad, you know?

37:00.407 --> 37:02.741
I mean,
what am I gonna tell a kid?

37:02.809 --> 37:04.777
Hey, here's
everything <i>not</i> to do?

37:04.844 --> 37:06.178
How about you start

37:06.246 --> 37:08.547
with how you saved
the Taylors' lives?

37:08.615 --> 37:10.082
And me, too.

37:10.150 --> 37:13.185
I saved your ass twice.

37:13.253 --> 37:15.554
Yeah, you did
a great job, Nate.

37:15.622 --> 37:17.656
Now, if your kid turns out
anything like you,

37:17.724 --> 37:18.891
I'm gonna be
a proud Uncle.

37:22.262 --> 37:25.497
All right.

37:25.565 --> 37:27.433
Take care of yourself,
huh?

37:27.500 --> 37:29.868
Be nice if my kid
had a cousin someday.

37:40.413 --> 37:42.381
Yeah, Mike.
Sam. Got your message.

37:42.449 --> 37:43.549
Look, it's about time.

37:43.617 --> 37:45.084
Hey, you done
with your family thing?

37:45.151 --> 37:47.119
'Cause I got a guy with
a seaplane on standby --

37:47.187 --> 37:48.787
no customs,
no questions.

37:48.855 --> 37:51.991
Yeah, Sam. I'm done.

37:57.019 --> 37:58.152
Welcome to paradise.

37:58.220 --> 38:00.121
You bring those goodies
we talked about?

38:00.189 --> 38:02.857
Everything one needs
for a proper vacation.

38:05.728 --> 38:07.895
We're stealing a list, Fi,
not staging a coup.

38:07.963 --> 38:11.966
Well, you know us girls.
We have a tendency to overpack.

38:12.034 --> 38:14.902
I'm guessing you didn't
invite me here for the view.

38:14.970 --> 38:16.537
This is where
the magic happens, Mikey.

38:16.605 --> 38:18.439
All right, this is how
this is gonna work.

38:18.507 --> 38:19.474
The rider we're looking for

38:19.541 --> 38:21.109
is coming our way
in about an hour.

38:21.176 --> 38:23.444
Sam, you and your truck
will be waiting for him.

38:23.512 --> 38:25.146
We know he'll be heading west,

38:25.214 --> 38:26.814
and we know
he has the list.

38:26.882 --> 38:28.249
Get ready guys.

38:28.317 --> 38:30.251
There's about to be a major
backup on Avenida de Paz.

38:38.961 --> 38:41.362
Okay, Fi,
he's headed your way.

38:45.501 --> 38:48.069
Getting into position.

38:48.137 --> 38:49.904
In position now.

38:52.841 --> 38:55.109
Here we go, Mike.
Batter up.

39:12.561 --> 39:15.096
Okay. Lifeline's ready, Mike.
Just say when.

39:22.070 --> 39:23.137
His friends are here, Fi.

39:28.811 --> 39:30.745
Now they see you.

39:33.615 --> 39:34.916
When!
Now they don't.

39:40.289 --> 39:41.455
When!

39:45.694 --> 39:47.495
<i>Special-forces squads</i>

39:47.563 --> 39:50.731
<i>are built around the skills</i>
<i>of the individual members.</i>

39:50.799 --> 39:53.100
<i>But no matter how good</i>
<i>each member of the squad is,</i>

39:53.168 --> 39:55.336
<i>every mission comes down</i>
<i>to one thing --</i>

39:55.404 --> 39:57.038
<i>how well they work together.</i>

39:57.105 --> 39:58.472
<i>Because in the end,</i>

39:58.540 --> 40:01.108
<i>you don't need a hero</i>
<i>to succeed in the field.</i>

40:01.176 --> 40:03.277
<i>You need a team.</i>

40:20.495 --> 40:22.463
This thing has aliases,

40:22.531 --> 40:24.866
department designations,
security clearances.

40:24.933 --> 40:26.067
Good lord.

40:26.134 --> 40:27.802
Put this through
the right system,

40:27.870 --> 40:30.171
you'd have the real name
of every single person

40:30.239 --> 40:31.772
on that list
in like 60 seconds.

40:31.840 --> 40:33.941
You're whispering.
You know that, right?

40:34.009 --> 40:34.942
I'm just saying,

40:35.010 --> 40:36.444
this is, without a doubt,

40:36.511 --> 40:39.947
the hottest potato I've ever
seen with my own two eyes.

40:40.015 --> 40:41.749
People are gonna die
if that thing gets out.

40:41.817 --> 40:42.917
Lives are gonna be ruined.

40:42.985 --> 40:44.085
Which is why
we need to make sure

40:44.152 --> 40:45.419
we this to the right people,
you know?

40:45.487 --> 40:46.554
And I'm thinking
Uncle Sam, Mike.

40:46.622 --> 40:47.989
Yeah, but who's
the right people?

40:48.056 --> 40:49.390
I wouldn't know who the hell
to trust with that thing.

40:49.458 --> 40:51.025
Well,
then that's our job --

40:51.093 --> 40:52.193
we find someone
that we can trust,

40:52.261 --> 40:53.494
we give them this list,

40:53.562 --> 40:55.930
and we let them dismantle
the whole damn network.

40:55.998 --> 40:58.132
Or we do the dismantling
ourselves.

41:00.002 --> 41:03.504
These people took away
everything you ever wanted.

41:03.572 --> 41:06.841
We need to track them down
one by one.

41:06.909 --> 41:08.809
And do what?

41:08.877 --> 41:10.244
You name it,
they deserve it.

41:10.312 --> 41:11.479
Mike,
you want to weigh in?

41:11.546 --> 41:13.014
The people on that list
burned you,

41:13.081 --> 41:14.649
so this is your call.

41:16.285 --> 41:18.185
Mikey?

41:20.422 --> 41:22.356
Mike,
you with us, man?

41:25.060 --> 41:27.728
Michael...

41:27.796 --> 41:29.563
What do you want to do?
