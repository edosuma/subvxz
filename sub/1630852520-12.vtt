00:02.703 --> 00:03.702
- I had intercourse with steve.

00:03.837 --> 00:05.637
I just don't think that
I'm good enough for you.

00:05.639 --> 00:08.773
- The guy was guilty!
- But you beat up a kid!

00:08.809 --> 00:11.876
- You can't protect me? You're
supposed to be my partner.

00:11.912 --> 00:13.645
- Looks like a teenage boy
moved in around here.

00:13.681 --> 00:15.514
- I didn't think
you'd be back yet.

00:15.583 --> 00:17.116
- So a teenage boy did move?

00:17.118 --> 00:19.351
- Your daughter is smuggling
drugs for the pandilla quince.

00:19.353 --> 00:21.920
- You have to let her go.
- We'll see what we can do.

00:21.989 --> 00:24.790
- This is the place that's going
to save my reputation.

00:24.859 --> 00:25.757
I'll support the funding.

00:25.826 --> 00:27.725
- So, adeline has someone inside

00:27.762 --> 00:29.194
Covering her tracks...

00:29.263 --> 00:31.063
- Which means the oce
has a dirty cop.

00:32.500 --> 00:34.333
- Where's my mother?
- She's with me.

00:34.335 --> 00:37.536
I need you to put it in the
system that I've been arrested.

00:37.671 --> 00:39.471
- If adeline killed
her own brother, she will kill

00:39.507 --> 00:41.573
My mother in a heartbeat.
Take ten minutes,

00:41.708 --> 00:43.007
Go grab a sandwich, I got you.

00:43.744 --> 00:45.610
I'm officially corrupt.

00:45.646 --> 00:48.480
- I just want you to know that
word spread about my arrest,

00:48.615 --> 00:50.382
Just like we planned.
- You're under arrest.

00:50.384 --> 00:52.484
Oh, my god, mom. You're okay.

00:52.553 --> 00:54.752
- I'm back, and if you don't
mind, I'd like my seat.

00:54.789 --> 00:57.689
- I'm gonna take you up on that
job offer. Head of security.

00:57.691 --> 00:59.858
- You know that cop, the one
who tried to frame me

00:59.993 --> 01:01.760
For the shooting? He's here.

01:01.829 --> 01:03.762
- This vip terminal
is the coyotes' new way

01:03.897 --> 01:04.763
Of smuggling in pink coke.

01:04.832 --> 01:05.930
- I guess you get to see

01:05.966 --> 01:06.965
Boss man.
(laughs)

01:06.967 --> 01:08.266
- So nice to see you,
deputy mayor.

01:19.513 --> 01:22.514
- Hmm, get me out of this
god forsaken city

01:22.649 --> 01:24.516
With the psychotic
book-clubbers.

01:24.651 --> 01:27.452
Mark my words, this never
would've happened in florida.

01:27.521 --> 01:29.922
- I think you're just as likely
to get abducted in florida.

01:30.057 --> 01:31.723
I mean, do you read
people magazine?

01:31.859 --> 01:35.127
- I intend to drive into my
gated condo and resume a nice,

01:35.196 --> 01:38.063
Quiet life of golfing,
and gardening, and g&ts.

01:38.132 --> 01:41.567
- Mom. You really were
quite remarkable.

01:41.569 --> 01:43.635
What I'm trying to say is...

01:43.637 --> 01:44.970
You're my hero.

01:45.973 --> 01:49.207
Really, you are so smart,
and funny...

01:49.276 --> 01:51.543
(chuckling)
...And interesting.

01:51.678 --> 01:53.178
And I think you're really kind.

01:53.247 --> 01:54.679
I mean, albeit in your
own particular way.

01:54.715 --> 01:56.381
- Yeah. Look where
you got it from.

02:00.421 --> 02:01.620
- I'm gonna miss you.

02:02.356 --> 02:03.721
(sniffing)

02:04.625 --> 02:05.823
- Mmm, your shirt smells

02:05.860 --> 02:07.025
Kind of musty.
- What?

02:07.094 --> 02:08.993
- Did you leave it sitting
in the dryer for too long?

02:09.029 --> 02:10.461
- You know what?
Let's hit the road, please.

02:10.498 --> 02:12.164
- You did. I'm sure you did.
- No, I didn't.

02:12.299 --> 02:14.766
No, I didn't, actually,
I laid it on top of the dryer
like you taught me.

02:14.835 --> 02:16.168
Can you just open the door,
please?

02:17.271 --> 02:19.037
- Richie, I'm glad you got
your own place,

02:19.039 --> 02:20.705
But you need to quit
that airport job.

02:21.975 --> 02:24.442
We both know it's bad news
over there. And right now,

02:25.646 --> 02:27.379
You got a lot of
good things going,

02:27.381 --> 02:29.181
So you need to keep your head
down and your nose clean.

02:29.316 --> 02:32.084
- I'm not leaving dane.
I gotta get him out of there.

02:32.086 --> 02:34.452
- Okay, richie,
this is not the time

02:34.522 --> 02:36.854
For you to be a hero, okay?

02:37.992 --> 02:39.925
Imma be that asshole right now

02:39.927 --> 02:41.926
That's gonna quote your
favourite movie back at you.

02:42.930 --> 02:45.330
"you're a good man
with a good heart,

02:45.465 --> 02:48.466
And it is hard for a good man
to be a king."

02:48.502 --> 02:50.669
- See, that was a mistake.
- Eh?

02:50.804 --> 02:53.071
- 'cause now you know what I
gotta say back to that, right?

02:53.807 --> 02:55.273
- What do you have to say?

02:55.309 --> 02:59.544
- I can decide what kind
of king I'm gonna be.

03:01.615 --> 03:02.647
Open it.

03:10.724 --> 03:11.656
- Mm-hmm...

03:16.597 --> 03:18.263
(gasping)
richie...

03:21.501 --> 03:23.302
- Yeah, I don't have
the receipt,

03:23.304 --> 03:26.371
So if, you know, you wanted
to return it, I'm sorry.

03:27.775 --> 03:32.044
♪ if I was king
for just one day ♪

03:32.046 --> 03:36.148
♪ I would give it all away ♪

03:38.319 --> 03:40.585
(indistinct chattering)
- ladies, I need a moment.

03:41.655 --> 03:42.988
- Oh god, do you think
she knows?

03:43.057 --> 03:44.289
- Knows what?

03:45.359 --> 03:47.326
- Like, knows that I
arrested adeline

03:47.328 --> 03:48.727
Before she was
actually arrested?

03:48.729 --> 03:50.996
Now, she's gonna fire me?
- Calm down.

03:50.998 --> 03:54.199
She's asking to see both of us.
She doesn't know anything.

04:04.544 --> 04:06.478
- I read your terminal v
reports.

04:06.480 --> 04:09.447
- Okay, that's great.
Fantastic, so...

04:09.449 --> 04:11.216
You're seeing what we're seeing?

04:11.218 --> 04:13.952
- What I'm seeing is a list
of their board of directors.

04:14.021 --> 04:16.755
A who's who of the most wealthy,

04:16.890 --> 04:21.026
Powerful, influential men and
women in the city. Big business.

04:21.095 --> 04:24.629
Politicians, cops, lawyers,
judges, you name it,

04:24.698 --> 04:26.765
They are on that board.

04:26.767 --> 04:30.234
So if and...
Whew, this is a big if.

04:30.271 --> 04:32.704
If you are gonna make this case,

04:32.839 --> 04:35.173
It has to be bulletproof.

04:35.209 --> 04:40.112
It has to be waterproof,
bombproof. Tsunami-proof!

04:40.247 --> 04:42.847
Every "t" crossed.
Every "I" dotted.

04:42.883 --> 04:45.249
Cover your asses, and mine.

04:45.286 --> 04:47.452
Tell me now if you don't
understand what I'm saying.

04:48.055 --> 04:49.187
(both): We do.

04:49.256 --> 04:50.955
- Okay. Shoo.

04:55.262 --> 04:57.228
- I'm the furthest thing
from bulletproof.

04:57.264 --> 04:59.664
- Later for that. Now, we focus.

04:59.667 --> 05:02.100
- Just how can I focus
when I'm this dirty,

05:02.102 --> 05:03.468
Dirty, dirty,
terrible, corrupt--

05:03.603 --> 05:06.138
- Hey. Don't wig out on me,
okay, wazowski?

05:06.273 --> 05:09.141
You did a bad thing,
but for a very good reason.

05:09.276 --> 05:13.145
And if you own up to it,
which you do not need to do,

05:13.280 --> 05:15.213
You'll get thrown off this case,

05:15.282 --> 05:17.282
And we will be down
one excellent cop at a time

05:17.284 --> 05:18.683
When we need her the most.

05:19.486 --> 05:21.253
Do you need a moment?

05:21.255 --> 05:24.089
- That's what I'm saying,
terminal v, five years
in the making.

05:24.091 --> 05:26.491
Deputy mayor briggs lobbying,
pushing through permits.

05:26.527 --> 05:28.593
Will french handling logistics
and construction.

05:28.729 --> 05:29.594
Hey.

05:31.365 --> 05:34.232
- Morning, detective.
- Uh, morning.

05:35.102 --> 05:36.434
- Okay, so...

05:36.503 --> 05:39.404
Now, we got pink cocaine
coming up from mexico.

05:39.406 --> 05:42.273
Local distributors include
bikers, mafia,

05:42.343 --> 05:43.975
And real estate agent
will french,

05:44.011 --> 05:46.310
Who we now learn
was figuratively in bed

05:46.347 --> 05:48.380
With deputy mayor marley briggs.

05:48.382 --> 05:50.916
Briggs has now opened up
a private airport terminal

05:51.051 --> 05:53.318
Five minutes from the gta
international airport.

05:53.320 --> 05:55.787
No checks and balances,
little to no security,

05:55.856 --> 05:58.055
And private planes coming up
from the us, from mexico,

05:58.092 --> 05:59.191
From south america.

05:59.193 --> 06:00.992
It's basically
the perfect gateway

06:00.994 --> 06:02.260
For cartel cocaine.

06:02.396 --> 06:05.397
Except we have nothing
on briggs.

06:07.067 --> 06:09.467
- We caught her daughter
with pink cocaine?

06:09.536 --> 06:11.770
- Mmm, okay. That's a maybe.

06:11.839 --> 06:13.004
- We have adeline in holding.

06:13.006 --> 06:14.306
We could take another
run at her.

06:14.441 --> 06:16.408
- Ooh, ooh, that's good.
I like that.

06:16.477 --> 06:18.944
- We've got michaels doing
security for briggs

06:19.079 --> 06:20.745
And doing favours
for the coyotes.

06:20.748 --> 06:23.948
I mean, that's not nothing.
- Mmm. That's not nothing.

06:24.585 --> 06:25.783
- It's a bold move.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.153
- Mama likes a bold move.

06:30.758 --> 06:32.423
(lawn mower whirring)

06:39.733 --> 06:41.432
(lawn mower powers down)

06:41.969 --> 06:43.235
(birds chirping)

06:47.074 --> 06:48.440
- Can I help you with something?

06:48.575 --> 06:50.542
- We have questions about
why you quit the force

06:50.611 --> 06:52.110
And started working
for deputy mayor briggs

06:52.245 --> 06:53.778
At her brand new private airport

06:53.847 --> 06:56.581
Which we believe is a front
for smuggling pink cocaine.

06:56.650 --> 07:00.919
- I was working as head
of security at terminal v,

07:00.921 --> 07:03.621
A job that I decided
to leave this week.

07:05.426 --> 07:07.659
- You quit? Why?

07:08.662 --> 07:11.663
- Because I prefer
mowing my lawn,

07:11.665 --> 07:14.332
And the job wasn't for me.

07:14.368 --> 07:16.201
- Gabrielle told us
that you forced her

07:16.203 --> 07:17.702
To drop zorka's charges.

07:17.704 --> 07:20.605
- And we also know you like
to do favours for briggs,

07:20.607 --> 07:22.874
And we know that
she's connected to the cartel.

07:22.876 --> 07:25.410
We're onto her, michaels.
It's only a matter of time.

07:25.545 --> 07:28.346
- So... We can bring you in
right now for interfering

07:28.348 --> 07:30.615
With zorka's fraud charges,
or we can all just, like,

07:30.617 --> 07:32.951
Sit down, you can tell us
what you know,

07:33.020 --> 07:35.620
Because your cooperation,
it really would go a long way.

07:36.890 --> 07:38.789
(birds chirping)

07:39.659 --> 07:41.392
- Allow me to put on some pants.

07:44.364 --> 07:45.964
<i> (pj): You have to calm down.</i>

07:46.033 --> 07:47.866
- I can't catch my breath!

07:47.935 --> 07:49.167
(door buzzing)

07:49.302 --> 07:50.802
My throat is closing up.

07:50.871 --> 07:52.237
- What's going on here?

07:52.239 --> 07:53.771
- She's allergic to the paint
on the walls.

07:53.807 --> 07:55.674
- Stuart, there's lead
in this paint,

07:55.809 --> 07:57.776
I can feel it off-gassing,
I can't stay here.

07:57.911 --> 08:00.778
- I'm not stu, and you're not
allergic to the paint.

08:00.814 --> 08:02.447
Sit down,
I got some questions for you.

08:02.449 --> 08:04.115
- I don't know anything,

08:04.184 --> 08:06.785
And I'm not faking it,
I have asthma.

08:06.920 --> 08:08.320
(breathing heavily)
and it gets worse

08:08.322 --> 08:10.455
When I'm tired or I'm hungry
and haven't eaten,

08:10.590 --> 08:13.325
Because pj will not feed me!

08:13.460 --> 08:14.926
- No, she wouldn't eat.

08:14.962 --> 08:17.128
She said she was allergic to
the peanut butter sandwiches.

08:17.264 --> 08:19.864
- Well, lucky for you,
you're moving out of
hotel holding tomorrow,

08:19.900 --> 08:21.266
And going to good ol' jail,

08:21.401 --> 08:23.001
Where you're gonna stay
until your hearing.

08:23.136 --> 08:24.402
- Why, stuart?

08:24.471 --> 08:26.771
- Because you're of no use
to us anymore.

08:26.773 --> 08:28.540
I mean, you don't know
anything, right?

08:29.943 --> 08:32.877
- No, you can't put me in a
place with a bunch of strangers.

08:32.880 --> 08:34.345
They're gonna get me.

08:35.215 --> 08:37.515
Coyotes could be
anywhere, anyone.

08:38.452 --> 08:40.985
He could be one.
- I am not a coyote.

08:41.054 --> 08:44.255
- Adam was in police custody.
They got to him, didn't they?

08:54.568 --> 08:56.301
(sighing)

08:56.436 --> 08:58.436
- Alright, listen to me.
I'll make you a deal.

08:58.438 --> 09:00.638
You cough up some solid evidence
on molina's connection

09:00.774 --> 09:03.240
To briggs, and I'll be
your transport.

09:03.277 --> 09:06.044
You want safe passage?
Work for it.

09:06.980 --> 09:09.714
- Ooh, ooh! Swish!
(laughing)

09:11.218 --> 09:14.252
- Yo. Something's
not right here, man.

09:14.254 --> 09:16.454
- Who cares?!
The hours are good,

09:16.456 --> 09:18.122
And we're making crazy money.

09:18.158 --> 09:20.525
Look, some suit from bogota
came through last week,

09:20.594 --> 09:23.261
Tipped me a c-note.
- Exactly.

09:24.264 --> 09:25.730
With money like that
thrown around,

09:25.799 --> 09:27.431
You really think there's not
gonna be a catch?

09:29.469 --> 09:31.069
- Then consider me caught up.

09:31.138 --> 09:33.572
- Let's start with
deputy mayor briggs.

09:33.707 --> 09:34.940
How did you meet her?

09:36.276 --> 09:38.442
- Fundraiser.
She was a city councillor,

09:38.478 --> 09:40.145
We were both rising
through the ranks.

09:40.280 --> 09:42.280
It was practical and political.

09:42.415 --> 09:44.282
She'd just been elected
deputy mayor,

09:44.351 --> 09:46.985
She called me for a favour.
She said a friend of hers

09:47.054 --> 09:49.821
Had been arrested
on minor fraud charges,

09:49.956 --> 09:51.489
And could I make them go away.

09:51.558 --> 09:55.026
- Zorka farkas.
- Then I got promoted to oce,

09:55.062 --> 09:57.762
And the next time I saw her
was when briggs' daughter
was arrested.

09:57.897 --> 09:59.297
- Is that why you got promoted,

09:59.299 --> 10:00.432
Because of deputy mayor briggs?

10:00.567 --> 10:03.567
- I don't know. I wondered.

10:03.604 --> 10:06.504
Then, you guys found
adeline's thumb drive.

10:06.506 --> 10:10.775
Evidence against enrique molina,
new head of the sinaloa cartel.

10:10.777 --> 10:12.210
When briggs heard about it,

10:12.212 --> 10:13.645
She told me to get rid
of the evidence.

10:13.714 --> 10:16.181
- Or?
- Or she'd tell shanks and hill

10:16.316 --> 10:19.184
That I'd misunderstood our
conversation about zorka farkas,

10:19.319 --> 10:21.386
And that I'd finessed
the fraud charge

10:21.388 --> 10:23.988
In an attempt to curry favour
with a person in power.

10:23.991 --> 10:27.258
- So instead,
you damaged crucial evidence
and framed me for it.

10:29.663 --> 10:30.862
- I'm sorry.

10:30.931 --> 10:33.865
I was stuck,
and I covered my ass.

10:35.168 --> 10:38.536
Maybe it hasn't happened
to you guys, but it happens.

10:43.377 --> 10:44.476
- Hey.

10:44.478 --> 10:46.344
Transporting adeline french?

10:46.479 --> 10:48.079
It's a bad idea, brother.

10:48.115 --> 10:50.014
- Yeah, well, I made a promise.

10:50.050 --> 10:51.349
Quid pro quo.

10:53.887 --> 10:56.620
Adeline and will shared
a safety deposit box.

10:56.657 --> 10:58.890
She gave me permission to go
in there without having
to get a warrant.

10:59.025 --> 11:01.493
The box contained
will's financial records.

11:01.628 --> 11:04.628
E-transfers from his private
accounts to adam gentle.

11:04.665 --> 11:06.364
Proof that he was laundering.

11:06.499 --> 11:10.334
Don't say anything just yet,
okay? I could really use a win.

11:13.040 --> 11:16.240
- Okay. But what does this have
to do with briggs and enrique?

11:17.444 --> 11:19.977
- This. The other half
of the puzzle.

11:21.648 --> 11:23.381
Adeline said that it's got
even more proof

11:23.450 --> 11:27.051
Of enrique's indiscretions,
plus all of gentle's records.

11:27.120 --> 11:28.920
Who got money when.

11:29.055 --> 11:30.722
Now, if she's right about
this thing,

11:30.724 --> 11:32.990
This could link every player,
including briggs, to the cartel.

11:33.026 --> 11:34.425
- Mm-hmm, have you looked at it?

11:36.396 --> 11:38.930
Let me guess.
You get her there safely,

11:38.932 --> 11:40.732
She gives you
the decryption code.

11:40.801 --> 11:42.266
I could decrypt
this thing right now.

11:42.302 --> 11:44.869
- No, I already tried, it's got
a dead man's trigger on it.

11:44.871 --> 11:47.138
Deletes itself if you run
any kind of software on it.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.207
I got the crown to give her
solitary confinement

11:49.276 --> 11:51.109
Up until the time
of her hearing.

11:51.111 --> 11:52.811
If I can get adeline
to grand valley,

11:52.946 --> 11:54.445
She'll give me the code.

11:54.481 --> 11:56.213
- This is dangerous, man.

11:56.249 --> 11:58.415
For you and her.
What if she's right,

11:58.452 --> 12:00.552
And the cartel does have
a price on her head?

12:00.554 --> 12:01.886
- You want to nail briggs
or not?

12:01.888 --> 12:03.788
- Of course.
But I don't trust adeline.

12:03.857 --> 12:05.222
She's gonna finesse you.

12:06.326 --> 12:08.159
Maybe I should--
- you should what?

12:08.161 --> 12:09.961
You should do this
instead of me?

12:09.963 --> 12:12.730
Okay, tough guy, 'cause what,
you can see through her game,
but I can't?

12:12.865 --> 12:15.233
- No, I'm a nice guy,
she will finesse the hell
out of me too.

12:15.235 --> 12:17.769
She's a master manipulator.
Let's just play it safe.

12:17.904 --> 12:19.370
Figure out a way to open up
the files,

12:19.439 --> 12:21.239
Let bloch and the etf guys
take her in.

12:21.241 --> 12:22.841
- I can handle her, okay?

12:22.976 --> 12:25.209
Believe me, I'm not as nice
as you all think that I am.

12:27.614 --> 12:30.381
<i> - You ever seen briggs</i>
<i> with members of the cartel?</i>

12:30.383 --> 12:34.451
Any mention of a coyote alliance
or any sign of pink cocaine?

12:34.488 --> 12:36.053
- I only worked there
for two weeks.

12:36.123 --> 12:39.056
The terminal is in soft opening
mode, I didn't see anything.

12:40.227 --> 12:43.528
- Soft opening. What,
there's a hard opening?

12:43.597 --> 12:45.797
- Yes, tomorrow.
- What do you mean?

12:45.932 --> 12:47.798
- There's a private
ribbon cutting

12:47.834 --> 12:49.900
With the board of directors,
and all the vips.

12:52.539 --> 12:53.738
What?

12:53.740 --> 12:56.107
- Brad, you are never
gonna be a hero, but maybe...

12:56.977 --> 12:59.143
Maybe you can be our inside man.

13:11.358 --> 13:12.423
- Deputy!

13:13.359 --> 13:15.059
Uh, they told me
you were in here.

13:16.229 --> 13:17.695
- What do you want, brad?

13:17.731 --> 13:20.965
- I made a mistake. I would very
much like my job back.

13:21.100 --> 13:23.835
I was adjusting to leaving
the force so abruptly,

13:23.970 --> 13:26.037
I made a rash decision,
very unlike me,

13:26.172 --> 13:27.839
And I apologize.

13:27.841 --> 13:30.074
- I'm sorry, you're too late.

13:30.110 --> 13:32.410
Jeff! I'd like to introduce you

13:32.479 --> 13:35.479
To my new head of security,
jeff keegan.

13:36.349 --> 13:37.582
- Hey, brad. Good to see you.

13:40.920 --> 13:44.255
- Our plan to use michaels
as the inside man didn't work,

13:44.324 --> 13:46.690
'cause guess who showed up
to take his place?

13:47.460 --> 13:48.759
Jeff keegan.
- Right?

13:48.829 --> 13:50.327
Just when you think
it couldn't get any worse.

13:50.363 --> 13:51.796
Okay, so, where are you guys at
with adeline?

13:51.931 --> 13:53.731
- Uh, nothing solid yet,
but I'm still working on it.

13:53.800 --> 13:56.467
- Naz even offered to transport
her to grand valley tomorrow.

13:56.536 --> 13:58.535
- What? Oh god, no, no, no.
That's a terrible idea.

13:58.572 --> 14:00.672
You can't transport a sociopath.
- What do you care, sam?

14:00.674 --> 14:02.974
- Okay, okay, guys?
Can we focus?

14:02.976 --> 14:04.609
Michaels said that
they're planning on doing

14:04.678 --> 14:06.678
A private ribbon cutting
tomorrow.

14:06.813 --> 14:08.879
Just the board of directors,
the vips...

14:08.915 --> 14:11.115
- So what about that?
We plant one of our team,

14:11.151 --> 14:14.752
Maybe as a vip, scout it out.
- Briggs has seen me,

14:14.754 --> 14:16.553
She's been here, so she's
probably seen every one of us.

14:16.590 --> 14:18.756
- But if briggs is in
as deep as you say she is,

14:18.825 --> 14:20.591
She's probably got a whole file
on each one of us.

14:20.627 --> 14:23.428
- Yeah, but even if you put one
of our people in to pose as vip,

14:23.563 --> 14:25.697
Michaels said that there needs
to be an introduction...

14:25.832 --> 14:26.631
(sighing)

14:28.101 --> 14:30.268
- Why the hell would
I call my mother?

14:30.337 --> 14:32.437
She hasn't visited me here once.

14:32.439 --> 14:34.438
Not one time.
- Sorry, lorraine.

14:34.474 --> 14:36.440
That must be really rough.
- Do you know what's rough?

14:36.509 --> 14:39.377
Prison. Prison is rough.

14:40.480 --> 14:41.645
- We might be able to
help you with that.

14:41.681 --> 14:44.249
- How? Can you get me like,
an extra soft mattress,

14:44.384 --> 14:46.984
Or a straightening iron,
or some weed would be great

14:47.020 --> 14:49.520
To just take off the edge,
'cause prison is--

14:49.522 --> 14:51.088
- Lorraine, if you could
introduce your mother

14:51.157 --> 14:53.925
To someone over the phone,
maybe we could patch you out.

14:55.528 --> 14:56.928
- I don't know what that means.

14:57.063 --> 14:58.663
- We would drop your charges.

14:58.732 --> 14:59.797
If you cooperate.

15:01.334 --> 15:04.034
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, we are.

15:07.774 --> 15:09.206
- Okay.

15:09.742 --> 15:11.609
Okay. Um...

15:11.678 --> 15:13.811
Oh wait, would my mom
get in trouble though?

15:13.813 --> 15:15.613
'cause I mean, she's a bitch,

15:15.748 --> 15:17.014
But she's still my mom.

15:17.717 --> 15:19.516
- Lorraine, listen, um...

15:21.354 --> 15:23.221
We think it's your mother
who set you up

15:23.223 --> 15:24.822
To bring in the drugs.
It's a long story,

15:24.858 --> 15:27.024
But we think your mother's
connected to the mexican cartel.

15:28.528 --> 15:30.528
- Someone knew
you were travelling
back and forth from mexico.

15:30.530 --> 15:33.631
Someone gave anthony
your personal cell number.

15:33.766 --> 15:36.167
Someone also knew that you were,
let's say,

15:36.169 --> 15:40.137
Vulnerable to attractive men
who would promise you the world.

15:43.143 --> 15:44.608
Lorraine, you were a pawn.

15:46.112 --> 15:47.611
Let's go get the queen.

15:48.581 --> 15:50.782
- It's fine, mom.
I know you're busy.

15:50.784 --> 15:53.717
<i> - I really am.</i>
<i> It's been absolutely insane</i>

15:53.753 --> 15:54.852
<i> With this airport project.</i>

15:56.222 --> 15:58.322
- Well, that's actually what
I wanted to talk to you about.

15:59.659 --> 16:02.860
I have this friend, we've been
sharing a room recently.

16:02.896 --> 16:05.663
Well, technically, it's a cell.

16:05.665 --> 16:10.802
Um... But she was in for fraud
charges, and she's out now.

16:10.937 --> 16:13.004
<i> - Lorraine, how does this</i>
<i> concern me?</i>

16:13.807 --> 16:15.807
- Well, she's filthy rich.

16:16.743 --> 16:18.743
Well, at least her boyfriend is,

16:18.745 --> 16:21.212
And she's interested
in joining your airport.

16:22.849 --> 16:23.648
<i> - Oh.</i>

16:24.617 --> 16:26.351
- So I can give her your number?

16:28.221 --> 16:31.155
<i> - I believe everyone deserves</i>
<i> a second chance.</i>

16:31.290 --> 16:32.623
<i> I've run my campaigns on it.</i>

16:32.659 --> 16:34.826
<i> I might even be able</i>
<i> to meet her today.</i>

16:35.495 --> 16:36.561
<i> What's her name?</i>

16:38.097 --> 16:39.196
- Bree.

16:39.966 --> 16:41.398
Bree argawal.

16:42.902 --> 16:44.769
- You really think would
people believe I'm a
millionaire fraudster?

16:44.904 --> 16:48.706
- No. But they will believe
mizzbreethebizz is.

16:50.944 --> 16:53.311
I took a stroll
through your viewpix.

16:53.313 --> 16:55.479
Little photoshop,<i> et voilà.</i>

16:56.583 --> 16:58.215
- Whoa.
- Hmm?

16:58.918 --> 17:00.584
- I'm starting to see it.

17:00.620 --> 17:03.921
- Okay. I'm briggs, you're vip.

17:03.923 --> 17:04.755
(clearing throat)

17:05.925 --> 17:06.924
Go.

17:08.862 --> 17:11.962
- Hey! Mayor briggs,
what's happening?

17:11.998 --> 17:14.665
I'd be interested in hearing
more about your operation.

17:14.701 --> 17:17.968
I mean, no. N-not like
super interested. I mean...

17:20.173 --> 17:23.207
I would be down, if you ever
wanted to tell me more about it.

17:23.209 --> 17:25.943
- Okay, okay. Breann, um...

17:27.480 --> 17:30.681
Uh... What we're really
looking for is a look.

17:30.683 --> 17:32.283
- Okay.
- Okay? No, no,

17:32.418 --> 17:33.584
Don't write this down.
Just put that down.

17:33.719 --> 17:36.086
Just put that down.
Just free flow,

17:36.122 --> 17:37.822
Be in the flow with us.
(sighing)

17:37.891 --> 17:39.623
Yeah, just shake it out,
shake it out, shake it out.

17:39.659 --> 17:41.825
It's a look that says,

17:41.861 --> 17:43.828
"your life isn't worth
the garbage can

17:43.897 --> 17:45.162
That I just chucked
my iphone into

17:45.231 --> 17:46.897
Because the screen got smudged."

17:47.766 --> 17:49.834
No. Okay. Um, it's real easy.

17:49.836 --> 17:51.302
I-it's like, uh...

17:53.840 --> 17:56.039
- Oh yes, yes!
- Or, or, or...

17:57.510 --> 17:58.309
- Okay.

17:58.378 --> 18:00.110
- The squint,
that's a good one.

18:01.915 --> 18:03.113
- Oh, my god.

18:04.384 --> 18:06.784
Okay, breann, would you rather
have a family of penguins

18:06.919 --> 18:08.852
That lived in your butt,
or the body of a shrimp?

18:08.888 --> 18:09.954
- Ew.

18:10.023 --> 18:11.189
- Yes!
- Hey!

18:11.324 --> 18:12.657
- That's it right there!

18:21.968 --> 18:23.667
(camera clicking)

18:25.271 --> 18:26.470
- Alright, remember,

18:26.506 --> 18:28.339
You don't get out of bed
for less than a birkin.

18:28.408 --> 18:30.574
And you're already own
five of them bad boys.

18:30.610 --> 18:33.477
(car doors closing)

18:36.883 --> 18:39.417
(aircraft passing overhead)

18:44.624 --> 18:48.258
Looking good, chattopadhyay.
Looking good.

18:50.096 --> 18:51.762
- Miss agarwal.

18:55.502 --> 18:58.702
So lovely to finally
put a face to the voice.

18:58.738 --> 19:01.105
This is my head of security,
jeff keegan.

19:01.240 --> 19:03.174
- Are you sure that
he won't recognize her?

19:03.243 --> 19:05.008
- Yep. They've never met.

19:05.978 --> 19:08.312
- Just wait until
you get inside.

19:08.314 --> 19:09.179
(camera clicking)

19:09.949 --> 19:12.450
Annual membership is 10,000,

19:12.585 --> 19:14.318
Plus 3,000 per flight,

19:14.453 --> 19:17.255
Not including the rental cost
of your plane, of course.

19:18.725 --> 19:21.725
- I don't do rentals.
We have our own plane.

19:21.761 --> 19:23.727
- Oh. Well then, in that case,

19:23.796 --> 19:25.863
I'd love to tell you more
about our hangar space.

19:25.998 --> 19:28.132
<i>(kelly over earpiece): Alright,</i>
<i> let her know you're not</i>
<i> strictly above board.</i>

19:28.267 --> 19:31.135
- Okay, but discretion is
important, and...

19:32.338 --> 19:34.738
This place doesn't feel
very discreet.

19:34.774 --> 19:36.273
- Well, it's not normally
like this.

19:36.342 --> 19:37.474
<i> Our team members are busy</i>

19:37.510 --> 19:39.076
<i> Getting ready for</i>
<i> the ribbon cutting tomorrow.</i>

19:39.112 --> 19:40.878
- Why don't you
come by tomorrow?

19:41.013 --> 19:42.580
<i> You can get a sense</i>
<i> of the clientele,</i>

19:42.715 --> 19:45.216
And I'm sure that you will meet
some like-minded people.

19:45.285 --> 19:47.918
- I'll talk to my assistant,
see if we can fit it in.

19:56.462 --> 19:57.995
(crows cawing)

20:01.634 --> 20:03.634
- How much longer, sir?

20:06.439 --> 20:09.507
It's really hard to stay hidden
with my hands behind my back.

20:09.642 --> 20:11.308
How long of a drive is this?

20:13.446 --> 20:16.180
I don't feel well.
I'm so hungry.

20:16.315 --> 20:18.849
- Don't care.
- I don't believe you.

20:19.852 --> 20:21.986
You do care about people
in general,

20:21.988 --> 20:23.453
And that's what
makes you different.

20:23.489 --> 20:24.589
(whistling)

20:24.724 --> 20:26.791
Honestly, I haven't eaten
in three days,

20:26.793 --> 20:28.793
And who knows how long
it will be until they feed me.

20:28.928 --> 20:30.995
Please, can we go to like,
a drive-through?

20:31.064 --> 20:32.930
- Drive-through... What do you
think this is, adeline?

20:32.932 --> 20:34.932
Like a date?
If you're really that hungry,

20:35.067 --> 20:36.934
I got a peanut butter bar
over here for you.

20:37.069 --> 20:39.269
- I... I would be happy
to eat it.

20:40.540 --> 20:43.106
It's just,
my hands are... Cuffed.

20:44.244 --> 20:46.977
- I thought you were allergic
to peanuts.

20:48.481 --> 20:51.014
Go ahead. Keep trying to pull
the wool over on me,

20:51.050 --> 20:52.549
It's not going to work.

20:53.620 --> 20:55.486
(engine revving)

20:56.355 --> 20:58.422
- Please. I'm so hungry.

20:58.557 --> 20:59.623
- Shut up for a second.

21:01.160 --> 21:03.527
(engine revving)

21:08.234 --> 21:10.000
- Oh, my god.
It's them, isn't it?

21:10.036 --> 21:11.702
- No, it's just some jackass
trying to pass me.

21:13.640 --> 21:15.138
- Oh, my god. We're gonna die!

21:15.808 --> 21:16.740
(tires screeching)

21:18.311 --> 21:20.511
Oh, my god. See, I told you
they were coming for me!

21:21.447 --> 21:22.646
We're gonna die,
we're gonna die.

21:22.715 --> 21:25.248
I told you they were
coming for us, I told you!

21:25.285 --> 21:27.584
(gasping)
oh, my god, we're gonna die!

21:27.620 --> 21:28.986
- Shut up, we're not gonna die!

21:29.121 --> 21:30.454
(tires screeching)

21:31.557 --> 21:33.758
- See, I'm not a liar!
- Yes, you are!

21:33.760 --> 21:36.226
- Okay, fine!
Not when it counts!

21:36.829 --> 21:38.262
(tires screeching)

21:51.210 --> 21:53.010
(panting)

21:54.614 --> 21:56.747
(upbeat music playing)

22:07.627 --> 22:09.560
(camera clicking)

22:16.569 --> 22:18.068
(crows cawing)

22:18.137 --> 22:20.037
(panting)

22:41.394 --> 22:43.928
Thank you for being so nice.

22:44.063 --> 22:46.663
- Not nice. Just doing my job.

22:48.801 --> 22:50.801
- You're not gonna let me die,
are you?

22:50.870 --> 22:52.269
- No, you're gonna be fine.

22:54.741 --> 22:55.940
(gasping)

22:56.075 --> 22:58.542
Oh god, adeline, would you stop
with the theatrics?

22:58.677 --> 22:59.943
I told you,
you're not gonna die.

23:00.012 --> 23:02.613
- Peanuts! Peanuts!
(gasping)

23:02.748 --> 23:05.348
- Hey, hey, I'm serious.
Stop it!

23:06.352 --> 23:07.551
Oh, geez.

23:07.686 --> 23:09.019
(adeline gasping)

23:13.626 --> 23:15.693
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Send an ambulance, now!

23:15.828 --> 23:17.794
I have a woman here who's going
into anaphylactic shock!

23:18.865 --> 23:20.330
- Richie! What's good?

23:21.467 --> 23:22.966
You seem to have things
all locked down here.

23:23.002 --> 23:24.034
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

23:24.103 --> 23:25.735
It's good to have you
on the team. Dane.

23:27.173 --> 23:29.173
Okay, guys, opening day.

23:29.175 --> 23:31.075
I got a vip landing
in a few minutes,

23:31.210 --> 23:33.177
He's coming in
for the ribbon cutting.

23:33.312 --> 23:36.146
Now, he's got sensitive cargo
that needs to be unloaded.

23:36.215 --> 23:38.381
I'm counting on you two guys
to get it done right.

23:38.418 --> 23:40.317
(dane): Copy.
- Richie?

23:40.453 --> 23:41.651
(funky music)

23:41.687 --> 23:44.855
This is the job, okay?

23:44.857 --> 23:46.924
- Yes, sir.
- Great.

23:47.993 --> 23:49.192
Alright, I'll text you
when he lands.

23:49.228 --> 23:50.527
- Okay.

23:52.899 --> 23:54.364
(grunting)

23:54.434 --> 23:55.999
- Down you go, down you go.

23:56.035 --> 23:57.334
Alright. You're alright.

23:57.470 --> 23:59.437
(panting)

24:02.074 --> 24:04.007
(gasping)
hang in there, hang in there.

24:04.043 --> 24:05.276
Come on, breathe,
adeline, breathe!

24:05.411 --> 24:08.345
Oh, come on, adeline!
Hang in there!

24:08.414 --> 24:10.146
Hang in there, hang in there!

24:10.183 --> 24:11.015
(grunting)

24:12.985 --> 24:14.551
(vehicle approaching)

24:19.625 --> 24:20.624
(gasping)

24:22.962 --> 24:24.028
- Hand me the phone.

24:24.030 --> 24:25.662
(panting)

24:33.372 --> 24:36.373
Enrique. It's adeline french.

24:38.043 --> 24:40.711
I heard you were paying
top dollar for a thumb drive.

24:40.713 --> 24:41.712
<i> - Miss french.</i>

24:41.847 --> 24:43.179
I'll call you back later.

24:43.216 --> 24:45.015
We found a place to connect.

24:50.490 --> 24:53.990
Good morning, gentlemen.
What a day to be alive.

24:54.026 --> 24:56.460
- Enrique! Welcome.

24:58.364 --> 25:01.231
Let's rubber stamp you through
customs and get you a drink.

25:01.300 --> 25:02.800
- Who's taking care
of my luggage?

25:02.802 --> 25:05.368
- Those two.
Both excellent young men.

25:06.772 --> 25:08.605
- Right this way.
How was your flight?

25:08.641 --> 25:09.806
- It was okay.

25:09.842 --> 25:11.008
- Thanks.

25:11.010 --> 25:12.610
(indistinct chattering)

25:12.612 --> 25:15.045
Honestly, guys,
it's a little bit tacky.

25:15.047 --> 25:18.081
- Alright, good, breann.
Harness that snobbery.

25:18.150 --> 25:19.983
<i> - Oh. Briggs just walked in.</i>

25:21.787 --> 25:23.253
(camera clicking)

25:24.624 --> 25:25.889
(phone chiming)

25:25.958 --> 25:28.291
- Yep. Crooked politician
ruling the roost.

25:29.562 --> 25:31.962
- All this luggage here?
Get that to my office

25:32.097 --> 25:35.566
As soon as possible.
Do not pass go.

25:35.635 --> 25:38.902
Okay? You got this.
You're my guys.

25:41.774 --> 25:44.975
- Yo. There's definitely
not clothes in there.

25:46.045 --> 25:47.645
- If you're so sure
something's up,

25:47.780 --> 25:51.214
Then why are you still here?
- Because. Look...

25:52.384 --> 25:54.050
I've been biking down
malcolm street with you

25:54.086 --> 25:56.252
Since we had training wheels.

25:56.289 --> 25:59.123
It's not safe for me
in marshall court right now,

25:59.258 --> 26:01.058
But if I need to find
a new street,

26:01.060 --> 26:02.726
I at least want you there
with me.

26:02.795 --> 26:04.928
Dane, we got options.

26:04.931 --> 26:06.130
- Look. I'm not you, man.

26:06.132 --> 26:08.298
I know there's a risk,
but I'll take it.

26:10.903 --> 26:14.071
- Okay. Let's at least find out

26:14.140 --> 26:16.706
What that risk is,
then you can decide.

26:17.543 --> 26:19.242
(indistinct chattering)

26:22.181 --> 26:24.148
- Uh... Guys,

26:24.150 --> 26:26.350
<i> Enrique molina just walked in.</i>

26:26.352 --> 26:28.118
- Are you sure?
Can you get us a photo?

26:28.253 --> 26:29.686
<i> - Welcome, everyone!</i>

26:29.722 --> 26:32.289
It is my pleasure
to welcome you all

26:32.424 --> 26:36.393
To the next chapter in
the history of our fine city.

26:36.395 --> 26:41.999
Terminal v heralds a new era
of opportunity and of growth.

26:48.907 --> 26:51.708
- It's empty.
- Why is it so heavy, then?

26:51.744 --> 26:54.511
- When I look out
at all of your faces,

26:54.547 --> 26:57.915
<i> I see what bold innovation</i>
<i> can create.</i>

26:58.050 --> 27:02.653
With your support,
our new luxury airport

27:02.722 --> 27:04.921
Will forge connections
with friends

27:04.957 --> 27:08.591
Both across the globe,
and locally,

27:08.628 --> 27:12.028
<i> With our pioneering</i>
<i> youth employment program.</i>

27:14.066 --> 27:14.965
(zipping)

27:18.404 --> 27:19.502
- What the hell?

27:20.873 --> 27:26.410
- So, without further ado,
I present to you terminal v.

27:26.412 --> 27:29.345
Together, we will make toronto

27:29.382 --> 27:32.882
An elite destination
in every respect.

27:32.918 --> 27:35.218
(light applause)
(laughing)

27:35.254 --> 27:37.987
Thank you. Thank you so much.

27:38.958 --> 27:40.090
Thank you.

27:47.099 --> 27:49.500
(distant sirens wailing)

27:49.635 --> 27:50.667
(grunting)

27:55.908 --> 27:57.374
(sighing)

27:57.376 --> 27:59.243
(vehicle approaching)

28:02.048 --> 28:03.980
(panting)

28:06.385 --> 28:09.185
- Sir. Are you the one having
an allergic reaction?

28:09.221 --> 28:13.590
- No. Believe it or not,
I'm a police officer.

28:13.592 --> 28:15.259
- What happened to your head?

28:15.261 --> 28:17.861
- Nazir, what the hell happened?
Where's the prisoner?!

28:19.165 --> 28:21.531
- Just get, get, get!
- Whoa.

28:26.706 --> 28:28.005
(exhaling)

28:28.140 --> 28:30.373
Armstrong.
Let me ask you a question.

28:31.510 --> 28:32.942
When adeline told you
that she was allergic

28:32.978 --> 28:34.878
To the paint in the walls,
what did you do?

28:34.880 --> 28:36.947
- Checked her vitals,
asked about her symptoms...

28:36.949 --> 28:39.416
- Did you happen to give her
an epinephrine

28:39.485 --> 28:41.084
Auto-injector by any chance?

28:41.153 --> 28:42.653
- Well, she was really
freaked out,

28:42.788 --> 28:44.221
And I couldn't
get her to calm down.

28:44.290 --> 28:46.656
- So you gave a criminal
in a holding cell

28:46.726 --> 28:49.359
A needle full of adrenaline...

28:49.361 --> 28:51.829
And you didn't think
to maybe let me know?

28:51.831 --> 28:53.764
Even though you knew I was going
to be travelling with her?!

28:53.766 --> 28:55.832
- Well, I thought that you would
do a search of her, so...

28:55.968 --> 28:57.801
- I did a search. I just assumed
that she was searched

28:57.803 --> 29:00.437
When she went into the cell,
and searched when she
came out of the cell.

29:00.439 --> 29:01.705
I did a tertiary search.

29:01.840 --> 29:03.640
I would've done
a thorough search

29:03.642 --> 29:09.413
If I had known that some uniform
jackass gave her a needle!

29:09.415 --> 29:12.316
- I'm sorry, I didn't think
she was lying about the allergy.

29:12.318 --> 29:14.617
- She wasn't lying, you idiot!

29:16.422 --> 29:19.056
Search the perimeter.
She's around here somewhere.

29:19.191 --> 29:22.091
She got my clothes.
She got my gun.

29:24.530 --> 29:26.263
- Bob, are your guys in position

29:26.332 --> 29:28.265
In case we have to "audible"
this and go in?

29:28.334 --> 29:30.868
- I have to speak with
inspector shanks right away.

29:30.870 --> 29:33.604
Yeah, it's urgent. Tell her
we have the head of the cartel

29:33.606 --> 29:35.738
In our sights.
(sighing)

29:36.942 --> 29:38.107
(phone chiming)

29:40.112 --> 29:41.545
- What the hell?

29:43.015 --> 29:43.947
Look.

29:44.750 --> 29:46.349
- Damn, that's the pink cocaine.

29:49.455 --> 29:51.421
- Richie, it's me.
Where are you?

29:51.557 --> 29:53.290
What plane? Call me back now.

29:53.359 --> 29:54.591
- Duff, it's okay.
We're gonna find them.

29:54.726 --> 29:56.293
- You don't think this looks
like he got interrupted?

29:56.362 --> 29:58.361
The kid's smart. He would've
said which plane.

29:58.430 --> 30:00.363
- Bob, get your team
on standby, now.

30:00.432 --> 30:01.731
- Breann, we're gonna need
your help.

30:01.801 --> 30:04.101
<i> We need to find out what plane</i>
<i> enrique came in on.</i>

30:04.236 --> 30:06.770
<i> Keep him distracted</i>
<i> until etf shows up.</i>

30:06.839 --> 30:09.239
<i> (kelly): Don't try for sexy.</i>
<i>It's not gonna work on this guy.</i>

30:09.241 --> 30:10.707
<i> (sam): You're gonna have</i>
<i> to nerd out.</i>

30:10.776 --> 30:12.476
People who own planes love
to talk about planes,

30:12.611 --> 30:15.979
So you own a...
- A gulfstream g550.

30:16.114 --> 30:18.715
<i> Maximum range just under</i>
<i> 13 000 kilometres.</i>

30:18.851 --> 30:22.185
<i> Four living areas,</i>
<i> 19 passengers, sleeps 8.</i>

30:22.188 --> 30:23.854
- Um, go again?

30:23.989 --> 30:25.522
- Guys, I'm going in. It's okay.

30:25.591 --> 30:27.658
- Sam. Keegan will
recognize you.

30:27.793 --> 30:28.992
<i>(breann): He's not in the tent.</i>

30:29.127 --> 30:30.727
- I'm making my way to you.
- Sam.

30:30.863 --> 30:32.396
- Don't worry.
I'll be careful, duff.

30:37.669 --> 30:38.602
(clearing throat)

30:39.905 --> 30:41.605
- Hi, I'm bree.

30:42.641 --> 30:44.541
- Nice to meet you.
Have a great time.

30:47.279 --> 30:49.146
(clearing throat)
- not interested.

30:50.015 --> 30:51.148
- In what, exactly?

30:51.150 --> 30:53.016
- This terminal.
It's pretty rinky-dink.

30:53.151 --> 30:56.086
- Oh. What is it
that you fly, bree?

30:56.155 --> 30:59.289
- Gulfstream g550.
My only complaint,

30:59.424 --> 31:00.757
It doesn't sleep an even 20.

31:00.893 --> 31:02.992
Like, 19 passengers,
what is that?

31:03.929 --> 31:05.161
- And what's the maximum
on that one?

31:06.465 --> 31:08.965
- It's just under 13,000.

31:10.068 --> 31:11.635
<i> - No, I meant</i>
<i> the high-speed cruise.</i>

31:11.637 --> 31:13.770
(sam): Oh, it's mach .85.

31:13.772 --> 31:15.572
More like .80
if you're going long-range.

31:15.641 --> 31:18.508
- Hmm.
- Alonza harris, bree's pilot.

31:18.644 --> 31:20.911
We're just fuelling up, and then
we're ready for takeoff.

31:20.980 --> 31:23.846
We'll meet you back there?
- I'm definitely ready to leave.

31:26.185 --> 31:28.385
- A female pilot.
How intriguing.

31:28.520 --> 31:30.854
- There's not many of us.
I take it you rent?

31:30.989 --> 31:33.523
- Oh god, no.
I own a belmont 300.

31:33.559 --> 31:36.526
It's right from the apron.
Just right outside.

31:36.562 --> 31:38.595
- Belmont 300, get the wheel!

31:38.730 --> 31:40.063
<i> Sam, we're on our way.</i>

31:40.099 --> 31:42.532
(phone ringing)
- will you excuse me?

31:42.668 --> 31:43.467
Yes?

31:43.602 --> 31:45.034
<i> (man): You should</i>
<i> get out of here.</i>

31:48.741 --> 31:51.942
- Why did you have to open
those suitcases?

31:52.077 --> 31:54.410
I had to call the owner
and explain,

31:54.446 --> 31:57.347
And tell him that we had
interference.

31:57.416 --> 31:59.950
Do you have any idea

32:00.019 --> 32:03.653
What that means for you? For me?

32:15.834 --> 32:17.900
<i> (sam): Enrique just left</i>
<i> the tent. Do you see him?</i>

32:17.937 --> 32:21.037
- Hey, duff, wait!
Etf is two minutes out.

32:21.073 --> 32:23.106
- I'm not waiting.
I'm sick of waiting.

32:23.241 --> 32:25.776
- Hey! Consider that an order!
Kelly!

32:33.919 --> 32:35.118
- Get enrique!

32:35.120 --> 32:37.821
- No way, I'm your backup! Hey!

32:41.126 --> 32:44.461
- Very goddamn clear!
Get the luggage,

32:44.530 --> 32:45.862
Take it to my office,

32:45.898 --> 32:48.665
Certainly do not open
the luggage!

32:48.734 --> 32:50.533
What are you guys, stupid?!

32:50.569 --> 32:51.668
- Put it down, keegan.

32:53.805 --> 32:55.705
I said put it down, now.

33:04.282 --> 33:05.882
(breathing heavily)

33:05.884 --> 33:07.550
Now put your hands on your head
and turn around.

33:07.586 --> 33:09.152
- Oh, come...
- Do it!

33:23.469 --> 33:26.036
I find it almost unthinkable.

33:26.972 --> 33:27.837
- Oh, yeah?

33:28.974 --> 33:30.440
What's that, kel?

33:32.711 --> 33:34.844
- That you used to be my hero.

33:45.057 --> 33:47.590
(indistinct police
radio chatter)

33:51.830 --> 33:54.263
- I'm sorry.
- It's alright.

33:56.468 --> 33:58.101
- Really?
- You did good.

33:58.137 --> 33:59.736
Yeah, it's alright.

34:02.241 --> 34:03.140
- Oh, my god.

34:05.110 --> 34:06.676
Hey, deputy mayor.

34:06.812 --> 34:08.044
I think these are for you.

34:09.014 --> 34:10.013
Let's go.

34:21.460 --> 34:23.659
(indistinct chattering)

34:29.068 --> 34:30.967
- Hey. I heard what happened.

34:32.137 --> 34:35.105
- I'm waiting to get balled out
by the boss now.

34:35.107 --> 34:38.308
- Please don't...
Beat yourself up.

34:38.310 --> 34:40.377
It's not your fault.
Adeline is a psychopath

34:40.512 --> 34:42.412
And she's freakishly
manipulative,

34:42.414 --> 34:43.780
Especially with people like us.

34:43.915 --> 34:45.515
- What are people like us, sam?

34:46.118 --> 34:47.049
Dumb?

34:47.920 --> 34:50.419
- No. Not dumb.

34:51.723 --> 34:55.124
We just... Want to believe
the best about other people.

34:55.160 --> 34:57.060
You know, give them
the benefit of the doubt.

34:57.195 --> 34:58.662
We want to be heros,
we just kind of look

34:58.797 --> 34:59.996
For that quality
in other people.

35:01.032 --> 35:01.898
- You're right.

35:02.934 --> 35:04.868
I gave you the benefit
of the doubt.

35:04.870 --> 35:07.003
I believed the best about you.

35:08.940 --> 35:14.410
I believed that you would value
someone who was nice,

35:14.446 --> 35:18.114
And kind, and respectful.

35:21.553 --> 35:22.886
But where did that get me?

35:25.023 --> 35:27.223
I'd say I'm pretty dumb, sam.

35:28.160 --> 35:29.692
At least I was.

35:30.896 --> 35:31.895
(sniffling)

35:31.897 --> 35:33.096
Not anymore.

36:03.929 --> 36:05.595
- Not your desk, wazowski.

36:07.633 --> 36:09.031
- Not my boss, brad.

36:16.008 --> 36:17.740
- I want to say thank you.

36:18.810 --> 36:19.742
- For what?

36:20.812 --> 36:23.413
- For treating me
with respect yesterday,

36:23.415 --> 36:24.947
Which I didn't deserve.

36:24.983 --> 36:26.749
I'm not sure I would've done
the same,

36:26.785 --> 36:29.885
Especially if I was as
squeaky clean as you are.

36:31.823 --> 36:35.025
- So what happens now?
- I don't know.

36:35.160 --> 36:36.759
Professional standards
questioned me

36:36.828 --> 36:37.961
For five hours straight,

36:38.030 --> 36:39.829
But at least they're letting me
go home tonight.

36:42.334 --> 36:43.199
- Brad.

36:44.436 --> 36:47.771
I'm-I'm... I'm not that squeaky.
I'm not that clean.

36:47.906 --> 36:49.639
I mean, I am clean, like,
I'm physically clean,

36:49.774 --> 36:52.375
But I just, I made a really big
mistake a few days ago,

36:52.510 --> 36:55.111
Like a major one. Not as bad
as yours, but not that far off.

36:55.247 --> 36:59.649
I did it... For someone
that I love, but still.

37:00.552 --> 37:01.918
- Career ender?

37:03.855 --> 37:04.988
- I'm not sure yet.

37:10.729 --> 37:12.862
- You know why I quit
the airport job?

37:14.066 --> 37:16.966
My first day, briggs implied
to me that she'd asked

37:16.969 --> 37:18.735
Will french to get rid
of gabrielle.

37:18.870 --> 37:20.870
Said she didn't like loose ends.

37:21.940 --> 37:24.007
I couldn't be that guy
one day longer.

37:24.009 --> 37:26.142
That was the beginning
of the end for me.

37:26.144 --> 37:27.811
Then you guys came calling,

37:27.813 --> 37:29.412
Which I knew you would,
and um...

37:29.414 --> 37:33.083
Frankly, it was a relief
to come clean.

37:34.586 --> 37:37.353
At that point,
doing the right thing
was the only way forward.

37:40.859 --> 37:42.759
You're good police, wazowski.

37:43.895 --> 37:45.261
So hang in there.

37:53.838 --> 37:54.837
(sighing)

37:57.776 --> 38:00.109
(knocking)
(shanks): Oh hey, sam. Come in.

38:00.145 --> 38:01.711
- Hey.
- Come in. Listen,

38:01.846 --> 38:03.780
I just got off the phone
with the guys upstairs,

38:03.915 --> 38:08.184
They are so excited about--
- boss? I wouldn't...

38:11.589 --> 38:13.056
Could I just have a minute
of your time?

38:14.259 --> 38:15.325
- Uh-oh.

38:16.895 --> 38:17.993
How bad?

38:21.133 --> 38:22.331
- It's not great.

38:25.737 --> 38:27.303
- Okay.
(sighing)

38:46.792 --> 38:48.358
- I see you made it out.

38:48.427 --> 38:49.925
Lucky you.

38:49.961 --> 38:51.361
- Lucky me.

38:52.164 --> 38:53.696
Do you have the usb?

38:54.933 --> 38:56.900
- You're always in such a rush.

38:57.035 --> 38:58.134
(chuckling)

39:01.740 --> 39:04.240
Fine. Fine.

39:05.043 --> 39:06.976
I got the usb in my pocket,

39:07.012 --> 39:09.646
I'm gonna pull it out right now,
but I mean it...

39:09.648 --> 39:14.316
Gun lowered until
I'm out of here safely.

39:15.587 --> 39:16.519
(speaking spanish)

39:19.091 --> 39:21.191
(gunshots)

39:24.930 --> 39:26.662
Did you know enrique
was a pedo?

39:28.066 --> 39:30.466
If you don't believe me, then
why don't you see for yourself?

39:31.536 --> 39:33.736
Alright, well,
why don't you just take me

39:33.772 --> 39:34.938
To wherever you were taking him?

39:35.073 --> 39:36.206
- You got it, miss adeline.

39:38.810 --> 39:40.676
- That's the general, to you.

39:45.817 --> 39:48.151
- Oh! Hey, guess what?
- Hey.

39:48.153 --> 39:49.952
- Adriana had her baby!
- Oh!

39:49.988 --> 39:52.822
- Yeah! She's tiny,
but she has a full head of hair.

39:52.858 --> 39:55.191
She's so cute,
I could just eat her up!

39:56.094 --> 39:57.760
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

39:57.796 --> 40:00.430
- You're an auntie.
- I'm an auntie.

40:01.833 --> 40:04.901
Next best thing to motherhood,
and I'm smitten!

40:06.304 --> 40:08.971
- You got any pictures?
- I do.

40:09.007 --> 40:10.840
Yes, I do. Here.

40:12.644 --> 40:15.779
Look at that.
- Hey! She looks like you.

40:15.914 --> 40:18.381
(laughing)
- don't tell my sister, shh.

40:18.516 --> 40:20.516
- Okay. She got a name yet?

40:20.652 --> 40:22.051
(sighing)

40:22.087 --> 40:23.853
- No, but you know,
addy's a hippie,

40:23.889 --> 40:25.321
So she's probably gonna
take a couple--

40:30.529 --> 40:32.895
That's, um...
That's a bold move.

40:34.699 --> 40:36.265
- You said you were tired
of waiting.

40:37.202 --> 40:39.002
(soft music)

40:55.821 --> 40:57.220
(knocking)

40:57.289 --> 40:59.288
(kelly): Wazowski! You in there?

41:00.425 --> 41:02.225
The desk sergeant said
you left 20 minutes ago

41:02.294 --> 41:03.692
And you looked upset.

41:03.728 --> 41:06.061
And I need to talk to you
about something.

41:07.699 --> 41:10.166
Um, okay, I know
you're in there,

41:10.168 --> 41:11.767
'cause your car's here.

41:13.271 --> 41:16.172
Hey! I see you
sitting on the floor!

41:16.241 --> 41:17.907
(soft music continues)

41:20.645 --> 41:22.712
Remember that key you gave me?

41:22.781 --> 41:25.648
'cause bffs give each other
house keys!

41:28.286 --> 41:31.454
I'm warning you,
I'm pulling it out right now!

41:31.456 --> 41:34.924
Putting it in the door!
Opening the door!

41:43.134 --> 41:44.133
Hey, buddy.

41:46.071 --> 41:47.202
You okay?

41:49.140 --> 41:50.339
What's going on?

41:56.381 --> 41:57.680
- I got demoted.

41:59.350 --> 42:00.483
(sighing)

42:01.953 --> 42:02.885
- To?

42:09.127 --> 42:10.292
- Uniform.

42:10.962 --> 42:11.961
I don't know where.

42:13.565 --> 42:15.298
(sighing)
it's okay though, really,

42:15.300 --> 42:18.034
'cause I deserve it.
- No, you don't.

42:18.103 --> 42:20.703
There is not one world
in which you deserve that.

42:21.706 --> 42:23.373
Sam, you...

42:25.043 --> 42:28.177
...Are one of the best cops
that I've ever worked with.

42:29.847 --> 42:33.449
You're good, you're smart,
you have integrity,

42:34.486 --> 42:36.386
And you're my best friend.

42:39.858 --> 42:41.590
Wow. You didn't even twig.

42:43.061 --> 42:43.892
(scoffing)

42:46.364 --> 42:48.797
I said you're my best friend.

42:54.405 --> 42:55.405
(sighing)

42:55.407 --> 42:56.271
Come here.

42:57.809 --> 43:00.944
I am not doing this without you.

43:01.079 --> 43:02.011
So...

43:03.081 --> 43:05.280
If you're leaving oce,

43:05.317 --> 43:06.815
I'm leaving too.

43:15.026 --> 43:16.960
Subtitling: Difuze
