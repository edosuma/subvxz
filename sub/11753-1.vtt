Wilder: What time do you
want us tonight?

05:40.519 --> 05:42.684
- Seven sharp.
- That reminds me.

Come on.

I can't.
I haven't drunk enough yet.

I don't wanna disappoint them.

05:58.187 --> 05:59.851
What is Helen feeding you?

05:59.853 --> 06:01.918
Nothing.
She's too depressed to cook.

06:02.519 --> 06:04.151
I should have married
someone like you.

06:04.386 --> 06:06.351
- Stoic and perfectly breasted.
- Mm.

06:06.853 --> 06:09.517
You know, I'd dearly like to get
in between those thighs of yours

I suppose.

too many sweets.

little imps.

Doctor, this way.

21:00.019 --> 21:01.117
Excuse me.

21:49.219 --> 21:50.377
Charlotte: Royal likes you.

21:53.619 --> 21:54.934

penthouse since the accident.

22:01.385 --> 22:03.503
Charlotte: But everyone thinks
they know me.

22:04.452 --> 22:05.516
That's the trick.

22:08.885 --> 22:10.783
There's a rigid
social hierarchy here,

22:10.785 --> 22:12.250
whether Royal likes it or not.

22:13.186 --> 22:16.250
(moaning)

22:23.452 --> 22:25.570
Can you write me a script
for sleeping pills?

22:27.685 --> 22:28.783
No.

22:36.619 --> 22:38.537

your sister died.

22:39.885 --> 22:40.950
How do you know that?

23:36.619 --> 23:39.350
Laura: Sorry.
Just warming the milk.

23:39.352 --> 23:41.984
- Doesn't matter, I'm going out.
- I don't need a babysitter.

23:42.518 --> 23:43.917
What you need is to go to sleep

23:43.919 --> 23:45.416
or you'll be tired for school
in the morning.

23:45.418 --> 23:46.577
I don't want to go to school.

23:46.619 --> 23:47.650
Of course you don't
want to go to school,

23:47.652 --> 23:49.150
but we all have to do things
we don't want to do.

23:49.151 --> 23:51.070

He hates it.

38:59.718 --> 39:01.796
I'm afraid we might have
found something.

39:06.284 --> 39:07.483
What do you mean "something"?

39:24.884 --> 39:26.183
My father's not gonna like this.

39:33.351 --> 39:36.682
Woo-hoo! Come on, darling!

39:36.951 --> 39:40.382
Chop-chop! Half a league onward!

39:40.384 --> 39:42.582
(children screaming)

39:52.085 --> 39:54.149
- Dad: What are you in again?
- Sound.

39:54.718 --> 39:56.016
Just got back from Tanzania.

39:56.018 --> 39:58.249
Recording the mating cry
of the baboon.

39:58.784 --> 40:01.415
Awful bloody things.
They throw shit at you.

40:01.751 --> 40:02.816
Talbot: That's it.

40:04.251 --> 40:07.716
An object that is in motion
will not change its velocity

40:07.718 --> 40:11.116
unless an external force
acts upon it.

40:12.018 --> 40:14.249
I've no qualms about
the invasion of my privacy

40:14.251 --> 40:18.515
by government agencies or
data processing organizations.

40:19.118 --> 40:21.782
All I want is my fair share of
the electricity so I can turn

40:21.784 --> 40:25.782
a damned light on and ensure
I've wiped my backside properly.

40:26.618 --> 40:29.116
Teething problems, Wilder.
The building is still settling.

40:29.451 --> 40:32.349
Yeah, that what Herr Royal
told you, was it?

40:32.718 --> 40:35.515
Talbot: The fact is,
we're all bio-robots now.

40:35.517 --> 40:37.949
I mean none of us can live
without the equipment

40:37.951 --> 40:41.849
we surround ourselves with.
Cameras, cars, telephones.

40:41.851 --> 40:42.949
Exactly.

40:43.851 --> 40:46.116
- Thank you, Helen, very much.
- I wanna go home.

40:46.784 --> 40:50.849
I suspect Laing here has
been charged with disseminating

40:50.851 --> 40:53.515
propaganda amongst
the lower orders.

40:54.584 --> 40:58.182
The dangling carrot of
friendship and approval.

40:58.517 --> 41:00.582
Laing: Look, Toby,
try to fit in, all right?

41:00.584 --> 41:02.622
You want people to
like you, don't you?

41:03.918 --> 41:06.215
The children were turned away
from the pool this morning

41:06.217 --> 41:08.482
- for being too noisy.
- Under whose authority?

41:09.517 --> 41:11.182
Our lives are too messy,
Richard.

41:11.184 --> 41:13.049
Helen: Successful people don't
want to be reminded

41:13.051 --> 41:14.169
that things can go wrong.

41:15.751 --> 41:17.829
(high pitched voice)
Is that right, Laing?

41:18.618 --> 41:20.616
Are we the ones
letting the building down?

41:20.618 --> 41:21.616
(Laing laughs)

41:21.618 --> 41:25.582
I think any sensible person
would envy what you have here.

41:28.184 --> 41:29.249
(Wilder chuckles)

41:29.584 --> 41:33.282
Well, I won't have
my children humiliated.

41:35.184 --> 41:37.142
We'll start a
parents' action group.

41:37.351 --> 41:39.389
- Here we go.
- Who wants to go swimming?

41:39.517 --> 41:40.682
(children screaming)

41:40.684 --> 41:41.749
All right, come on.

41:43.884 --> 41:45.949
Richard, I don't have costumes
for all these children.

41:45.951 --> 41:47.949
I don't even know
if they can all swim.

41:48.018 --> 41:50.582
I'm not a parent but I am
a psychiatrist. Will that do?

41:51.584 --> 41:54.382
The more the merrier. Come on,
no time like the present.

41:54.384 --> 41:55.482
Come on, kids!

41:59.884 --> 42:01.515
This building's nowhere near
as homogenous

42:01.517 --> 42:02.756
as someone would like to think.

42:04.284 --> 42:06.402
- You're right about that.

42:38.117 --> 42:39.316
Why haven't you got a father?

42:42.718 --> 42:44.249
Laing: I'm so sorry. I...

42:44.751 --> 42:46.869
(laughs) I didn't mean
to say that out loud.

42:47.084 --> 42:49.242
Sorry, Toby. Come on,
let's help clear this up.

42:49.918 --> 42:51.482
Laura said your
family's all dead.

42:51.851 --> 42:53.649
- What?
- Did you kill them?

42:54.251 --> 42:55.315
(Laing laughs)

42:55.751 --> 42:56.849
Um.

42:58.117 --> 42:59.515
No. No, Toby, I didn't.

43:00.584 --> 43:02.662
What does it feel like
to be the last one?

43:08.951 --> 43:10.015
You know, Toby, um...

43:12.284 --> 43:14.602
when I was your age I was always
covered in something.

43:16.584 --> 43:17.649
Mud.

43:19.050 --> 43:20.782
Jam. Failure.

43:22.618 --> 43:24.897
My father would never
associate with anything dirty.

43:26.451 --> 43:28.949
- Or real.
- My father's up there.

43:31.584 --> 43:33.449
You mean he's in heaven?

43:34.117 --> 43:35.682
Toby: Heaven's not real, stupid.

43:38.551 --> 43:40.549
(sighs)
You should have gone with him.

44:12.184 --> 44:13.749
I'm gonna take Toby home.

44:15.784 --> 44:17.742
I think I've forgotten
how to sleep.

44:20.217 --> 44:22.655
You know, everyone's in terrible
debt like us, I'm certain.

44:24.417 --> 44:26.295
They're just better
at hiding it.

44:33.684 --> 44:34.782
Perhaps I can help.

44:40.751 --> 44:42.315

No, you shouldn't.

45:42.117 --> 45:44.649
It's undercooked. Send it back.

If it isn't the social climber.

babysitting now, has she?

What have you got there?

59:01.617 --> 59:03.815
- A kaleidoscope.
- Laing: Oh.

59:04.883 --> 59:06.561
Laing: What can you see
through that thing?

59:06.917 --> 59:08.015
The future.

59:08.416 --> 59:09.481
(laughs)

59:09.483 --> 59:12.348
And what do you want
to be in that future of yours?

59:12.617 --> 59:15.147
An engine driver?
An astronaut?

59:15.516 --> 59:18.514
- I wanna be better than you.
- Oh, for God's sake, Toby.

59:19.350 --> 59:21.068
Laing:
He's quite right.

59:21.717 --> 59:22.848
I should go and change.

59:25.049 --> 59:26.114
(mouthing)

59:38.383 --> 59:39.481
Simmons is right.

59:40.283 --> 59:42.281
Wilder is nothing but
an unconscionable

59:42.283 --> 59:43.581
fucking reprobate.

59:44.617 --> 59:46.147
He's symptomatic, isn't he?

59:46.516 --> 59:50.514
You know, the whole place
obviously needs a firmer hand.

59:51.283 --> 59:53.815
There's no food left.
Only the dog's.

59:55.049 --> 59:59.181
And Mrs. Hillman is refusing
to clean unless I pay her

59:59.183 --> 01:00:00.514
what I apparently owe her.

01:00:02.049 --> 01:00:04.915
Like all poor people,
she's obsessed with money.

01:00:06.116 --> 01:00:07.248
Yes.

01:00:07.550 --> 01:00:09.848
You know, we can't have
a repeat of last night.

01:00:11.250 --> 01:00:13.514
Pangbourne: We have got to show
the lower floors

01:00:13.516 --> 01:00:16.147
that we can throw
a better party than them.

01:00:17.717 --> 01:00:20.581
Healthy competition is the basis
of a modern thriving economy.

01:00:22.049 --> 01:00:24.448
But you're right,
we must prevail.

01:00:25.116 --> 01:00:26.481
Right, first things first.

01:00:28.949 --> 01:00:32.815
We must commandeer
all necessary resources.

01:00:33.949 --> 01:00:35.781
Simmons? List.

01:00:37.617 --> 01:00:38.681
Booze.

01:00:40.450 --> 01:00:41.581
Canapés.

01:00:44.383 --> 01:00:45.781
Cocktail onions.

01:00:47.916 --> 01:00:49.155
Pangbourne: Other suggestions?

01:00:50.583 --> 01:00:51.648
Cake.

01:00:51.916 --> 01:00:54.314
Are we talking about
a raiding party then?

01:00:54.783 --> 01:00:55.947
Pangbourne: Not so harsh.

01:00:57.049 --> 01:00:59.281
Although I think we
should be prepared

01:00:59.283 --> 01:01:02.248
to meet moderate resistance.

01:01:04.949 --> 01:01:06.181
Ah.

01:01:06.183 --> 01:01:07.648
Royal. Just the man.

01:01:08.850 --> 01:01:11.815
You still hold the key
to the building,

01:01:12.850 --> 01:01:14.947
symbolically, at least.

01:01:15.617 --> 01:01:17.535
We'd like you to lead
a delegation.

01:01:17.850 --> 01:01:19.348
Where to? The United Nations?

01:01:20.850 --> 01:01:22.181
The supermarket.

01:02:05.550 --> 01:02:06.615
Richard?

01:02:07.283 --> 01:02:09.161
- Is that you?
- It's all right.

01:02:09.849 --> 01:02:10.947
Go back to sleep.

01:02:22.216 --> 01:02:23.974
Helen:
What are you doing?

01:02:24.849 --> 01:02:26.768
Wilder:
I'm starting a new project.

01:02:28.949 --> 01:02:30.314
Another prison documentary?

01:02:35.683 --> 01:02:37.281
- Richard?
- What?

01:02:40.116 --> 01:02:42.154
You shouldn't leave me
alone like that.

01:02:45.016 --> 01:02:46.934
I love you
but I don't trust you.

01:02:47.283 --> 01:02:49.361
I don't think I ever have.
Isn't that sad?

01:02:50.083 --> 01:02:51.281
You're not alone.

01:02:52.717 --> 01:02:53.847
You've got the children.

01:02:55.183 --> 01:02:57.047
Things would be better
if we could afford to move

01:02:57.049 --> 01:02:58.114
to a higher floor.

01:03:01.250 --> 01:03:03.208
It's the light
I envy them up there.

01:03:08.782 --> 01:03:10.181
Wilder: Stop torturing yourself.

01:03:13.049 --> 01:03:14.414
You're perfectly happy.

01:03:17.516 --> 01:03:18.914
Try and be more like Charlotte.

01:03:23.216 --> 01:03:24.581
Less giving, you mean?

01:03:33.516 --> 01:03:36.181
- At least leave me some money.
- There's money on the table.

01:04:01.083 --> 01:04:02.581
(elevator chimes)

01:04:33.882 --> 01:04:35.081
(dog barking in distance)

01:05:04.949 --> 01:05:06.014
Excuse me.

01:05:06.749 --> 01:05:07.847
Get out of my way!

01:05:27.250 --> 01:05:28.348
Residuum.

01:05:28.350 --> 01:05:31.780
Some of these people generate
the most unusual garbage.

01:05:33.049 --> 01:05:35.407
Objects that could well be of
interest to the Vice Squad.

01:05:35.882 --> 01:05:36.947
Look.

01:05:38.782 --> 01:05:40.314
I don't know anything about it.

01:05:41.849 --> 01:05:43.248
I don't know what caused it.

01:05:45.183 --> 01:05:46.314
And I didn't do it.

01:05:46.749 --> 01:05:47.981
We're on the same level.

01:05:48.550 --> 01:05:49.947
That's all that counts now.

01:05:50.583 --> 01:05:52.581
At least until all
of this blows over.

01:05:55.682 --> 01:05:57.147
Steele:
Restrain that intruder!

01:05:57.383 --> 01:06:00.581
There, look! What we need
is a good sturdy chain!

01:06:05.016 --> 01:06:06.147
(dog whimpers)

01:06:09.083 --> 01:06:10.181
What are you doing?

01:06:10.416 --> 01:06:12.147
I'm packing to leave.

01:06:12.383 --> 01:06:13.481
What do you think?

01:06:13.483 --> 01:06:17.647
Has anyone actually made a
formal complaint to the owners?

01:06:18.083 --> 01:06:19.780
We are the owners.

01:06:20.350 --> 01:06:23.014
Pass me that green thing.
Daddy likes to see me in it.

01:06:24.116 --> 01:06:26.580
You're not going anywhere.
I forbid it.

01:06:28.516 --> 01:06:29.981
(Ann gasps)

01:06:31.383 --> 01:06:33.481
(Ann breathes heavily)

01:06:38.416 --> 01:06:39.481
(sighs)

01:06:40.450 --> 01:06:41.514
Well...

01:06:44.250 --> 01:06:47.680
That's the first time he's
touched me in... Six months?

01:06:49.616 --> 01:06:52.114
- (laughing)
- (elevator chimes)

01:06:53.882 --> 01:06:54.981
(Ann laughs)

01:07:01.782 --> 01:07:02.914
Royal: <i> Simmons!</i>

01:07:03.116 --> 01:07:05.780
(goat whimpers)

01:07:05.782 --> 01:07:07.114
Royal: <i> Simmons!</i>

01:07:07.849 --> 01:07:10.747
What's wrong? Poor little chap.

(screaming)

Pangbourne: What about him?

01:10:11.283 --> 01:10:12.580
I think he knows his place.

01:10:34.949 --> 01:10:36.947
Jane: Good God,
what do they look like?

01:10:37.283 --> 01:10:39.380
Cosgrove: You know,
I've never been in one of these.

01:10:39.382 --> 01:10:40.880
What does one do exactly?

01:10:40.882 --> 01:10:43.747
- Hunt and gather, of course.
- Gather what, exactly?

01:10:43.749 --> 01:10:45.181
(PA system chimes)

01:10:45.549 --> 01:10:47.981
Announcer: <i>Welcome to the
15th floor market.</i>

01:10:48.682 --> 01:10:51.014
<i>Today we have a special
offer on French bread</i>

01:10:51.016 --> 01:10:52.313
<i>and French</i> fromage.

01:10:52.582 --> 01:10:55.680
(distorted)<i> Thank you</i>
<i>for shopping on floor 15.</i>

01:10:57.949 --> 01:11:00.747
Wilder: Talbot! Where the hell
are you hiding, man?

01:11:00.749 --> 01:11:02.447
Talbot: The model
here is less the noble savage

01:11:02.449 --> 01:11:04.981
and more our un-innocent
post-Freudian selves.

01:11:05.582 --> 01:11:08.380
Perhaps they resent never
having had the chance

01:11:08.382 --> 01:11:09.447
to become perverse.

01:11:09.449 --> 01:11:12.647
Outraged by all that
over-indulgent toilet training.

01:11:14.716 --> 01:11:15.995
Customer:
Queue's back here, pal.

01:11:16.382 --> 01:11:19.047
(speaking French)

01:11:19.049 --> 01:11:21.513
Good. Working.
Need to get to the top.

01:11:21.916 --> 01:11:23.747
This money's yours if you can
point me in the direction

01:11:23.749 --> 01:11:24.847
of the service lift.

01:11:28.449 --> 01:11:31.313
Wilder: Oh, hello, girls.
Out on a spree, are we?

01:11:31.616 --> 01:11:32.947
That's Wilder!

01:11:33.216 --> 01:11:36.181
Yes, I recognize you
from the foyer.

01:11:36.183 --> 01:11:38.447
Sort of an agitator type.

01:11:44.549 --> 01:11:45.647
(Pangbourne grunts)

01:11:45.649 --> 01:11:48.181
Bet you wish you'd gone to the
back of the bloody queue now.

01:11:48.515 --> 01:11:49.580
Wilder: Bastard!

01:11:54.083 --> 01:11:55.947
Obviously a far more dangerous
mix than anything our

01:11:55.949 --> 01:11:58.247
Victorian forebears
had to cope with anyway.

01:11:59.616 --> 01:12:01.680
- (PA system chimes)
- (grunting)

01:12:04.183 --> 01:12:05.501
Excuse me,
let me through, please.

01:12:05.949 --> 01:12:07.114
Hold on.
What have you got?

01:12:07.382 --> 01:12:08.680
- Let me see it.
- Don't touch that.

01:12:08.682 --> 01:12:09.847
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

01:12:09.849 --> 01:12:11.088
Let me through, it's my paint.

01:12:12.716 --> 01:12:13.947
Get off that, it's mine.

01:12:13.949 --> 01:12:15.014
It's mine!

01:12:33.749 --> 01:12:35.480
(grunting)

01:12:48.282 --> 01:12:49.447
(shouts) It's my paint!

01:12:54.916 --> 01:12:56.313
You really smashed him up.

01:12:56.716 --> 01:12:58.280
I think you burst his eyeball.

01:13:00.682 --> 01:13:02.981
- (screaming)
- (indistinct shouting)

01:13:14.249 --> 01:13:15.513
Misogynist!

01:13:17.249 --> 01:13:18.347
(screaming)

01:14:11.749 --> 01:14:12.847
Talbot?

01:14:17.682 --> 01:14:19.747
He's expecting us.
I wonder where he is.

01:14:28.382 --> 01:14:31.513
Don't think you can count on
the Geneva bloody Convention

01:14:31.515 --> 01:14:34.413
to get you out of this one,
you longhaired poofter.

01:14:34.415 --> 01:14:35.580
(muffled) Help! Help!

01:14:36.182 --> 01:14:37.247
(knocking on door)

01:14:46.582 --> 01:14:47.680
Room for two more?

01:14:56.949 --> 01:14:58.947
I haven't got any money.
Will this do?

01:15:01.916 --> 01:15:03.035
Look after your brother.

01:15:05.515 --> 01:15:07.280
Why? You made him.

01:15:08.515 --> 01:15:09.580
Is it the bomb?

01:15:10.115 --> 01:15:12.034
- When are you coming back?
- Soon.

01:15:13.282 --> 01:15:14.413
Are you freaking out?

01:15:17.048 --> 01:15:18.146
Kiss.

01:15:18.849 --> 01:15:19.947
Kiss.

01:15:23.682 --> 01:15:24.747
(knocking on door)

01:15:35.082 --> 01:15:36.146
Laing: Helen.

01:15:36.682 --> 01:15:37.914
Come in, come in.

01:15:37.916 --> 01:15:38.981
Please.

01:15:39.382 --> 01:15:40.647
It's so nice to see you.

01:15:41.515 --> 01:15:44.614
Listen, you must
give me your opinion.

01:15:45.882 --> 01:15:47.960
I think I've finally found
the right tone.

01:15:50.849 --> 01:15:51.914
What do you think?

01:16:03.616 --> 01:16:05.213
Woman: (on radio)
<i>And now the shipping forecast</i>

01:16:05.215 --> 01:16:06.680

Royal: Simmons!

01:16:24.215 --> 01:16:25.280
Where's my wife?

01:16:26.282 --> 01:16:27.347
I don't know.

01:16:27.549 --> 01:16:29.467
Well who invited
all these people?

01:16:30.349 --> 01:16:31.614
They invited themselves.

01:16:34.015 --> 01:16:35.614
You can't hide up here forever.

01:16:36.882 --> 01:16:39.614
You'll have to go down there
and save her.

01:16:40.415 --> 01:16:41.480
He's right.

01:16:42.882 --> 01:16:44.920
Pangbourne:
She could get herself killed.

01:16:46.048 --> 01:16:47.113
Or worse.

01:16:49.115 --> 01:16:50.580
Unless that's what you want.

01:16:52.082 --> 01:16:55.180
You are fired.

01:16:57.382 --> 01:16:58.647
I don't work for you.

01:17:02.849 --> 01:17:03.967
I work for the building.

01:17:06.782 --> 01:17:08.614
Woman: (on radio)

01:17:08.616 --> 01:17:09.814

01:17:36.882 --> 01:17:37.946
Right.

01:17:37.948 --> 01:17:42.247
Which one of you bastards
is going to fuck me up the ass?

01:17:42.249 --> 01:17:44.180
(cheering)

01:17:44.716 --> 01:17:46.046
Woman: (on radio)
<i>...rain at times,</i>

01:17:46.048 --> 01:17:48.113
<i>moderate or poor becoming good.</i>

01:17:48.382 --> 01:17:51.547
<i>Biscay, south-westerly,
six to gale eight.</i>

01:17:51.549 --> 01:17:54.413
<i>Occasional rain,
moderate or poor.</i>

01:18:42.382 --> 01:18:44.280
(moaning)

01:18:53.749 --> 01:18:54.846
I'm coming.

01:19:52.749 --> 01:19:55.447
- What floor are you on?
- Uh, this one.

01:19:57.682 --> 01:19:58.747
What are you doing?

01:19:59.282 --> 01:20:00.347
Shh.

01:20:06.549 --> 01:20:07.647
Richard Wilder.

01:20:11.215 --> 01:20:14.247
It's a real pleasure,
Mr. Wilder.

01:20:17.382 --> 01:20:18.746
I'd watch out, if I were you.

01:20:19.881 --> 01:20:22.347
There's some very unhappy
bunnies bouncing about.

01:20:30.781 --> 01:20:31.846
(knocking on door)

01:20:35.382 --> 01:20:36.480
(knocking on door)

01:20:40.215 --> 01:20:41.280
P.C. White: <i> Hello?</i>

01:20:45.748 --> 01:20:46.813
(clears throat)

01:20:48.748 --> 01:20:49.813
White.

01:20:50.115 --> 01:20:51.180
Mr. Royal.

01:20:51.715 --> 01:20:52.874
Everything all right, sir?

01:20:53.249 --> 01:20:54.413
Perfectly.

01:20:56.349 --> 01:20:58.413
Bit of a mess in there,
isn't it?

01:20:59.382 --> 01:21:03.946
Oh, you know, nothing that can't
be "swept under the rug".

01:21:25.282 --> 01:21:27.180
(screaming)

01:21:30.449 --> 01:21:31.580
(glass shatters)

01:22:01.582 --> 01:22:03.679
(woman speaking in French)

01:22:15.449 --> 01:22:16.580
Royal: Enough!

01:22:20.715 --> 01:22:22.980
Kill you.
Go on, all of you!

01:22:26.549 --> 01:22:29.513
Quite enough fun
at my wife's expense.

01:22:30.549 --> 01:22:34.180
So if you will excuse us.

01:22:35.515 --> 01:22:37.347
We have guests waiting upstairs.

01:22:37.582 --> 01:22:38.646
Guests?

01:22:39.048 --> 01:22:40.966
- Come on, come on.
- Silly old me.

01:22:46.048 --> 01:22:47.146
Thank you, darling.

01:22:47.615 --> 01:22:49.380
I don't know what I would have
done without you.

01:22:49.382 --> 01:22:50.580
Shh.

01:22:50.582 --> 01:22:51.813
(groaning)

01:22:54.249 --> 01:22:55.813
Mrs. Hillman: Leave me alone!

01:22:56.282 --> 01:22:57.713
Leave me alone!

01:22:57.715 --> 01:22:59.347
Wilder: I won't be ignored.

01:22:59.681 --> 01:23:01.247
Tell me about the architect.

01:23:03.781 --> 01:23:04.913
(Mrs. Hillman squeals)

01:23:04.915 --> 01:23:07.280
Hillman: Senior side down!

01:23:13.082 --> 01:23:16.247
I won't be ignored.
You work for the Royals,

01:23:16.249 --> 01:23:18.247
you must have a way
into the penthouse.

01:23:18.681 --> 01:23:21.779
If I give you the key,
will you get my money?

01:23:22.282 --> 01:23:23.413
Money? Of course.

01:23:25.115 --> 01:23:27.513
If you really wanna know
about Anthony Royal,

01:23:28.549 --> 01:23:30.913
you'll have to talk
to that tart on 26

01:23:30.915 --> 01:23:32.873
with that poor little
bastard of his.

01:23:34.015 --> 01:23:35.146
Charlotte Melville?

01:23:36.082 --> 01:23:37.146
That's her.

01:23:38.249 --> 01:23:40.280
To sweethearts and wives.

01:23:42.915 --> 01:23:44.380
May they never meet.

01:23:44.381 --> 01:23:46.858
Mrs. Hillman: I suppose you're
a good boy really, aren't you?

01:23:48.781 --> 01:23:51.579
Big enough to come and go
as you please.

01:23:53.015 --> 01:23:56.347
Big enough to have your own key.

01:24:07.615 --> 01:24:08.746
What are you doing?

01:24:09.349 --> 01:24:12.280
I want to see you,
just once, properly.

01:24:13.748 --> 01:24:14.813
Please don't.

01:24:18.615 --> 01:24:20.746
I'm nearly perfectly
happy just as I am.

01:24:22.881 --> 01:24:24.113
Probably for the first time.

01:24:28.048 --> 01:24:31.113
Well, Charlotte's
right about one thing.

01:24:32.415 --> 01:24:34.693
You are definitely the best
amenity in the building.

01:24:40.082 --> 01:24:41.180
(knocking on door)

01:24:41.948 --> 01:24:43.413
Bugger off, you little shit!

01:24:43.681 --> 01:24:45.180
Or I'll pull your teeth out
through your ears

01:24:45.182 --> 01:24:46.447
and use them for buttons!

01:24:47.115 --> 01:24:48.180
Fuck!

01:24:57.881 --> 01:24:58.946
What's this?

01:24:59.415 --> 01:25:00.579
It's all right, Steele.

01:25:06.282 --> 01:25:07.347
Are you sure?

01:25:08.015 --> 01:25:09.146
It could be worth something.

01:25:09.148 --> 01:25:12.447
I've heard people are bartering
wives for food on other floors.

01:25:13.915 --> 01:25:15.113
I'm not that hungry.

01:25:16.382 --> 01:25:19.579
(Jane breathes heavily)

01:25:43.615 --> 01:25:45.693
Helen: <i>Charlotte's right
about one thing.</i>

01:25:46.249 --> 01:25:48.846
<i>You are definitely the
best amenity in the building.</i>

01:26:03.915 --> 01:26:05.280
<i>My name is Richard Wilder.</i>

01:26:06.948 --> 01:26:08.613
My name is Richard Wilder!

01:26:10.382 --> 01:26:12.579
<i>My name is Richard Wilder!</i>

01:26:13.414 --> 01:26:16.980
My name is Richard Wilder!

01:26:21.048 --> 01:26:23.347
(Helen screams)

01:26:24.681 --> 01:26:26.113
Richard Wilder!

01:26:29.414 --> 01:26:31.646
(screams)

01:26:45.881 --> 01:26:46.980
Wilder?

01:26:47.948 --> 01:26:50.066
What are you doing here?
How did you get in?

01:26:51.249 --> 01:26:53.980
(Wilder growling on recording)

01:26:55.015 --> 01:26:57.646
I thought you'd be downstairs
manning the barricades.

01:27:01.381 --> 01:27:03.113
I only came to get the
last of the supplies

01:27:03.115 --> 01:27:04.479
but I see you found them.

01:27:05.381 --> 01:27:09.579
(Wilder growling on recording)

01:27:12.414 --> 01:27:13.579
Get off!

01:27:15.048 --> 01:27:16.679
I know why I'm not your type.

01:27:17.881 --> 01:27:18.946
Don't be so silly.

01:27:20.581 --> 01:27:22.980
Oh, God, it's not just you.
It's everyone.

01:27:23.182 --> 01:27:24.247
Fibber.

01:27:25.948 --> 01:27:27.013
Let go!

01:27:28.215 --> 01:27:29.312
I know about you.

01:27:30.215 --> 01:27:31.779
I know about the architect.

01:27:32.915 --> 01:27:34.180
I know about Toby.

01:27:37.514 --> 01:27:38.613
You don't know anything.

01:27:38.615 --> 01:27:42.846
Quite the little building
project, isn't he, our Toby?

01:27:43.715 --> 01:27:44.946
The little professor.

01:27:48.681 --> 01:27:49.779
(Wilder laughs)

01:27:52.348 --> 01:27:54.113
Power will be restored tomorrow.

01:27:56.115 --> 01:27:57.446
Day after at the latest.

01:28:01.715 --> 01:28:05.312
I'll help you with your
stupid documentary then.

01:28:06.748 --> 01:28:11.013
But now I'm going
back to the party.

01:28:16.915 --> 01:28:21.213
Oh, I think you've had
enough excitement for one day.

01:28:21.215 --> 01:28:23.279
Richard, stop it. Stop it!

01:28:23.848 --> 01:28:25.512
No! (sobs)

01:28:26.715 --> 01:28:30.446
(screaming)

01:28:42.548 --> 01:28:43.980
(sobs) Please help me.

01:28:45.348 --> 01:28:46.512
(screams) Please help!

01:28:49.615 --> 01:28:50.679
Please!

01:28:53.915 --> 01:28:55.080
(Charlotte screaming above)

01:28:55.082 --> 01:28:56.560
Cosgrove:
<i>What are you doing in there?</i>

01:28:57.048 --> 01:29:00.113
♪ ("SOS" by Portishead plays) ♪

01:29:03.448 --> 01:29:05.246
Cosgrove:
<i>What are you doing?</i>

01:29:10.681 --> 01:29:12.080
<i>What are you doing in there?</i>

01:29:17.381 --> 01:29:19.579
Cosgrove: <i>What do you all do
while I'm at work?</i>

01:30:19.615 --> 01:30:20.679
Good morning.

01:32:07.748 --> 01:32:10.446
Now he's raping people
he's not supposed to.

01:32:11.015 --> 01:32:14.512
And to top it all, Mercer here
says he actually shat

01:32:14.514 --> 01:32:16.479
in his attaché case.

01:32:18.581 --> 01:32:22.746
Seems Richard Wilder
is certainly a maverick.

01:32:23.214 --> 01:32:25.512
A barrister, aren't you, Mercer?

01:32:26.081 --> 01:32:27.246
Retired.

01:32:27.248 --> 01:32:31.012
But it's still,
it's the principle.

01:32:32.114 --> 01:32:36.613
And I suppose you believe that
there should be unspoken rules?

01:32:37.414 --> 01:32:39.546
Even for this sort of thing?

01:32:39.548 --> 01:32:40.646
Mercer: Quite.

01:32:41.915 --> 01:32:45.012
Simmons has come up
with a workable solution.

01:32:45.014 --> 01:32:50.246
We get Laing to
lobotomize Wilder.

01:32:51.915 --> 01:32:53.713
Royal:
You can't be serious.

01:32:54.881 --> 01:32:56.479
It's an interesting thought.

01:32:57.381 --> 01:32:59.279
For the good of the building,
you mean?

01:32:59.281 --> 01:33:00.346
If you like.

01:33:01.348 --> 01:33:02.679
Shouldn't be too difficult.

01:33:02.681 --> 01:33:04.679
We've already made
contact with Laing.

01:33:05.181 --> 01:33:09.512
He insists on carrying out a
psychological evaluation first.

01:33:09.514 --> 01:33:10.613
Humor him, then.

01:33:10.615 --> 01:33:14.112
There's bound to be something
we can give Laing in exchange.

01:33:14.114 --> 01:33:16.679
I'd imagine he
wants to be left alone.

01:33:17.948 --> 01:33:19.012
(sighs)

01:33:19.014 --> 01:33:23.579
Nevertheless, you're all
forgetting one small point.

01:33:25.681 --> 01:33:26.813
This is my party.

01:33:28.081 --> 01:33:29.312
You're all my guests.

01:33:30.548 --> 01:33:33.746
I shall be the one who decides
if someone is lobotomized.

01:33:35.715 --> 01:33:37.279
You should thank us!

01:33:40.748 --> 01:33:42.479
You're the one he really wants!

01:33:43.947 --> 01:33:45.012
What?

01:33:45.781 --> 01:33:47.819
Simmons:
After all, you stole his wife.

01:33:51.414 --> 01:33:53.479
(laughs) I what?

01:33:54.514 --> 01:33:56.746
Certainly looks like that
on paper.

01:33:57.548 --> 01:34:00.145
Where is Wilder's wife now?

01:34:01.348 --> 01:34:02.479
Mercer: Broom cupboard.

01:34:02.947 --> 01:34:04.112
Pangbourne: Oh, perfect.

01:34:04.581 --> 01:34:06.779
We've got a vacancy
for a cleaner, haven't we?

01:34:07.615 --> 01:34:10.979
Yeah, right,
anyone going to work?

01:34:11.914 --> 01:34:12.979
Cosgrove.

01:34:13.548 --> 01:34:14.912
Most have taken leave.

01:34:15.581 --> 01:34:17.246
Well, quite right.

01:34:17.615 --> 01:34:19.412
The real work is here.

01:34:19.848 --> 01:34:22.045
Once we've dispensed
with the likes of Wilder,

01:34:22.047 --> 01:34:25.179
we play the lower people
off against each other.

01:34:25.581 --> 01:34:28.412
In short, Balkanize
the central section.

01:34:28.414 --> 01:34:32.312
Then begin colonization
of the entire building.

01:34:32.548 --> 01:34:37.613
Then I propose that Royal,
here, draw up plans

01:34:38.414 --> 01:34:40.646
to remodel the lower floors.

01:34:41.448 --> 01:34:42.512
Oh.

01:34:42.748 --> 01:34:44.479
Yes, a driving range.

01:34:44.848 --> 01:34:45.912
Cricket nets.

01:34:46.615 --> 01:34:47.679
Clubhouse.

01:34:49.348 --> 01:34:50.446
Pangbourne: Ah!

01:34:51.181 --> 01:34:52.279
What about the horse?

01:34:52.914 --> 01:34:54.012
What about the horse?

01:34:54.548 --> 01:34:55.646
We're gonna eat it.

01:34:56.848 --> 01:34:59.145
(Mercer chuckles)

01:35:00.014 --> 01:35:02.132
Dinner parties don't
grow on trees, darling.

01:35:03.414 --> 01:35:04.613
French do it all the time.

01:35:05.248 --> 01:35:06.512
Motion's carried.

01:35:07.914 --> 01:35:08.979
Meeting adjourned.

01:35:09.381 --> 01:35:11.139
Wouldn't say no
to a Bloody Mary.

01:35:11.348 --> 01:35:13.379
Mercer: I'll have the
kitchen look into it.

01:35:13.381 --> 01:35:14.620
Pangbourne: Who is the kitchen?

01:35:14.914 --> 01:35:16.512
The wives are rotating.

01:35:16.514 --> 01:35:18.192
- Ah!
- (both laughing)

01:35:19.681 --> 01:35:21.599
Still enjoying the party,
darling?

01:35:31.615 --> 01:35:34.346
(seagulls squawking)

01:35:47.914 --> 01:35:49.479
Fucking Christ.

01:36:50.448 --> 01:36:54.145
Cosgrove really is
quite convincing.

01:37:04.081 --> 01:37:06.679
(grunting)

01:37:08.014 --> 01:37:11.745
Cosgrove: What are you doing?
I... how fucking dare you!

01:38:05.581 --> 01:38:06.646
Laing!

01:38:08.548 --> 01:38:11.979
Funny, I was just
thinking about you.

01:38:14.281 --> 01:38:16.239
I was just about to leave.
Come in.

01:38:23.081 --> 01:38:24.145
How are things?

01:38:29.780 --> 01:38:31.079
<i>Comme ci comme ça.</i>

01:38:35.747 --> 01:38:36.812
Have you seen Helen?

01:38:38.081 --> 01:38:39.145
No.

01:38:45.047 --> 01:38:46.312
I'm no good without her.

01:38:48.680 --> 01:38:50.912
She shouldn't leave me alone.
It's this place.

01:38:52.780 --> 01:38:54.658
Won't let me find
my equilibrium.

01:39:00.214 --> 01:39:02.212
I thought I was cut out
for it, but...

01:39:03.714 --> 01:39:04.778
I'm not.

01:39:07.214 --> 01:39:10.312
Living in a high-rise requires
a special type of behavior.

01:39:13.414 --> 01:39:14.512
Acquiescent.

01:39:15.880 --> 01:39:16.979
Restrained.

01:39:20.847 --> 01:39:22.412
Perhaps even slightly mad.

01:39:27.914 --> 01:39:29.412
The ones who are the real danger

01:39:29.414 --> 01:39:31.446
are the self-contained
types like you.

01:39:34.514 --> 01:39:39.112
Impervious to the psychological
pressures of high-rise life.

01:39:41.381 --> 01:39:42.678
Professionally detached.

01:39:45.348 --> 01:39:46.412
Thriving.

01:39:46.947 --> 01:39:49.912
Like an advanced species
in the neutral atmosphere.

01:39:59.714 --> 01:40:00.912
I'm sorry you think that.

01:40:02.947 --> 01:40:04.012
No, you're not.

01:40:12.381 --> 01:40:13.512
Perhaps you're right.

01:40:26.181 --> 01:40:27.246
This might help.

01:42:13.914 --> 01:42:15.872
Simmons:
You won't be needing that.

01:42:19.847 --> 01:42:21.179
Come on, chop-chop!

01:42:33.580 --> 01:42:35.112
Pangbourne: Ah, Laing.

01:42:35.547 --> 01:42:36.678
Good of you to join us.

01:42:38.081 --> 01:42:39.200
Simmons: He won't do it.

01:42:39.381 --> 01:42:40.445
Oh.

01:42:40.614 --> 01:42:42.812
You should probably
reconsider that.

01:42:43.181 --> 01:42:44.678
It's not possible, I'm afraid.

01:42:45.348 --> 01:42:47.445
I will not lobotomize
Richard Wilder.

01:42:47.880 --> 01:42:49.912
He's possibly the sanest man
in the building.

01:42:49.914 --> 01:42:50.979
Oh.

01:42:52.281 --> 01:42:54.612
(groaning)

01:43:00.114 --> 01:43:05.812
Well, it's flying school
for you, I'm afraid, chum.

01:43:06.947 --> 01:43:09.012
- Simmons: Can I have his tie?
- If you must.

01:43:09.014 --> 01:43:10.932
- That's Savile Row, innit?
- Yes.

01:43:11.580 --> 01:43:12.845
(dogs barking)

01:43:18.181 --> 01:43:19.246
Pangbourne!

01:43:19.947 --> 01:43:23.246
What, Royal?
I'm in the middle of something.

01:43:23.447 --> 01:43:26.112
You can't put him over the edge.
He owes me a game of squash.

01:43:26.348 --> 01:43:28.465
Royal: Look, I insist you
stop this at once.

01:43:31.014 --> 01:43:32.678
All right then, let him go.

01:43:35.614 --> 01:43:38.645
(dogs barking)

01:43:42.014 --> 01:43:45.445
I'm having that tie
one way or another.

01:44:11.114 --> 01:44:14.411
(screaming)

01:44:16.281 --> 01:44:19.079
(screaming continues)

01:44:20.380 --> 01:44:22.778
Laing: <i>Ever thought of
leaving the nest yourself?</i>

01:44:23.413 --> 01:44:29.112
I was the first to arrive,
I shall be the last to leave.

01:44:34.547 --> 01:44:37.012
(Helen screaming below)

01:44:37.014 --> 01:44:41.712
You recall us speaking about
my hopes for the building

01:44:41.714 --> 01:44:43.945
to be a crucible for change?

01:44:45.347 --> 01:44:46.445
Of course.

01:44:46.714 --> 01:44:49.545
Well, all this has made
me realize something

01:44:49.547 --> 01:44:50.612
quite fundamental.

01:44:51.880 --> 01:44:53.838
It wasn't that I left
an element out,

01:44:55.380 --> 01:44:57.079
it was that I put too many in.

01:44:58.413 --> 01:44:59.411
(screaming continues)

01:44:59.413 --> 01:45:05.411
And now the building's failure
has offered those people

01:45:06.214 --> 01:45:10.246
the beginnings of a means
of escape to a new life.

01:45:10.847 --> 01:45:11.912
Mm.

01:45:13.614 --> 01:45:14.979
(screaming continues)

01:45:16.247 --> 01:45:17.311
Who knows...

01:45:18.780 --> 01:45:20.678
Perhaps it will become
a paradigm

01:45:20.680 --> 01:45:22.079
for future developments.

01:45:23.014 --> 01:45:24.079
(chuckling)

01:45:27.114 --> 01:45:30.179
And you, have you settled?

01:45:31.747 --> 01:45:32.812
I believe so.

01:45:37.247 --> 01:45:38.311
Impressions?

01:45:46.081 --> 01:45:47.179
(clears throat)

01:45:56.780 --> 01:46:03.645
Well, the lights, fire,
like neurons in a great brain.

01:46:04.547 --> 01:46:08.012
Laing: <i>The lifts seem like
the chambers of a heart.</i>

01:46:08.014 --> 01:46:09.445
(screams)

01:46:09.447 --> 01:46:10.612
Laing: <i> And when I move...</i>

01:46:10.614 --> 01:46:11.693
Pangbourne: That's it!

01:46:13.014 --> 01:46:15.912
<i>I move along its corridors
like a cell...</i>

01:46:16.413 --> 01:46:18.179
(laughing)

01:46:18.547 --> 01:46:20.112
<i>...in a network of arteries.</i>

01:46:20.380 --> 01:46:21.445
There we are.

01:46:22.280 --> 01:46:24.612
(breathing heavily)

01:46:24.614 --> 01:46:26.812
There.
That wasn't so bad, now was it?

01:46:27.014 --> 01:46:28.112
Pangbourne: Huh?

01:46:28.580 --> 01:46:29.645
Bravo.

01:46:30.680 --> 01:46:32.612
(baby crying)

01:46:46.914 --> 01:46:48.112
What... What is this?

01:46:49.513 --> 01:46:50.578
What do you think?

01:47:02.047 --> 01:47:03.112
Pudding?

01:47:05.081 --> 01:47:07.119
Laing: Right,
while I've got your ear...

01:47:09.180 --> 01:47:10.245
about Richard Wilder.

01:47:11.347 --> 01:47:13.345
You don't need to
worry about Richard.

01:47:13.914 --> 01:47:14.979
Or the others.

01:47:26.247 --> 01:47:28.578
- (baby crying)
- (Helen laughs)

01:47:30.247 --> 01:47:31.495
Bloody Mary, John?

01:47:31.496 --> 01:47:33.694
- Wet the baby's head.
- Where are all the menfolk?

01:47:34.614 --> 01:47:36.278
Cosgrove was taken, I'm afraid.

01:47:37.547 --> 01:47:38.912
On his way back from work.

01:47:39.880 --> 01:47:40.945
Christ.

01:47:41.280 --> 01:47:42.345
Really?

01:47:43.847 --> 01:47:45.345
Simmons has gone
to get him back.

01:47:45.614 --> 01:47:46.678
Oh.

01:47:47.014 --> 01:47:48.612
They may be some time.

01:47:50.614 --> 01:47:51.678
Now tell me.

01:47:52.714 --> 01:47:53.912
I can't remember.

01:47:53.914 --> 01:47:57.778
Have I ever given you
my autograph?

01:48:24.747 --> 01:48:25.812
Royal: Whose area?

01:48:27.047 --> 01:48:28.111
There's another.

01:48:53.714 --> 01:48:54.845
Wilder: <i> Helen!</i>

01:48:56.080 --> 01:48:57.245
<i>Helen!</i>

01:49:00.380 --> 01:49:01.578
<i>Helen!</i>

01:49:05.880 --> 01:49:06.945
It's you.

01:49:10.780 --> 01:49:12.678
- The architect.
- Yes.

01:49:16.213 --> 01:49:18.171
You see you've made
a mistake there.

01:49:19.247 --> 01:49:21.712
If you'd have confessed to your
sins on camera when our paths

01:49:21.714 --> 01:49:26.078
crossed in the foyer, I'd have
probably edited this bit out.

01:49:27.046 --> 01:49:29.645
I'm not accountable to you,
Mr. Wilder.

01:49:32.347 --> 01:49:33.411
Too late now, anyway.

01:49:33.914 --> 01:49:34.979
Camera broke.

01:49:35.747 --> 01:49:37.545
Oh, just one thing
before you go.

01:49:39.614 --> 01:49:41.612
Why exactly did
you take my wife?

01:49:45.347 --> 01:49:47.011
I can assure you,

01:49:47.012 --> 01:49:48.677
I have no interest
in your personal property.

01:49:48.680 --> 01:49:51.245
Because I ask myself why
would a great man like you

01:49:51.247 --> 01:49:53.511
feel the need to hide
behind women's skirts?

01:49:54.247 --> 01:49:56.945
Behind children, even.
Your own, as well as others'.

01:49:58.113 --> 01:50:01.912
How dare you judge me!
How dare...

01:50:01.914 --> 01:50:03.552
- Helen!
- (gunshot)

01:50:10.747 --> 01:50:11.845
That's right.

01:50:13.247 --> 01:50:15.678
You sit there and think about
what you've done.

01:51:11.347 --> 01:51:14.678
Laing: <i>On the whole,
life in the high-rise was good.</i>

01:51:16.080 --> 01:51:18.511
<i>There had been no obvious
point at which it had moved</i>

01:51:18.513 --> 01:51:20.778
<i>into a clearly more
sinister dimension.</i>

01:51:20.946 --> 01:51:22.178
(elevator chimes)

01:51:23.046 --> 01:51:24.144
<i>Helen was right.</i>

01:51:24.146 --> 01:51:29.778
<i>It was a huge children's party
which had got out of hand.</i>

01:51:31.680 --> 01:51:34.278
<i>Of course, Laing was sorry
the architect had died.</i>

01:51:35.714 --> 01:51:37.745
<i>He felt he owed the man
a debt of gratitude</i>

01:51:37.747 --> 01:51:38.978
<i>for his new family.</i>

01:51:40.580 --> 01:51:43.845
<i>The first Laing had ever really
felt part of.</i>

01:51:55.347 --> 01:51:58.278
<i>Now that several potential
patients had emerged</i>

01:51:59.614 --> 01:52:00.679
<i>here in the building,</i>

01:52:00.680 --> 01:52:01.745
<i>Laing might start
a private medical practice.</i>

01:52:02.180 --> 01:52:04.778
Steele: <i>Do you fancy a drink?
Cosgrove's here.</i>

01:52:05.347 --> 01:52:08.712
Laing: <i>And help others
surrender to a logic</i>

01:52:08.714 --> 01:52:10.245
<i>more powerful than reason.</i>

01:52:11.013 --> 01:52:13.478
Steele: All boys together.

01:52:15.780 --> 01:52:18.245
Laing's got someone waiting.

01:52:19.247 --> 01:52:20.345
You know how it is.

01:52:21.447 --> 01:52:22.511
Say no more.

01:52:27.013 --> 01:52:28.851
Laing:
<i>One thing was certain,</i>

01:52:29.747 --> 01:52:31.904
<i>now that everything was getting
back to normal,</i>

01:52:32.747 --> 01:52:34.625
<i>Laing would
throw his own party.</i>

01:52:35.347 --> 01:52:37.445
<i>A modest project which,
nevertheless,</i>

01:52:37.447 --> 01:52:40.178
<i>required careful
and cautious planning.</i>

01:52:42.347 --> 01:52:44.911
<i>For now, he would sit back,</i>

01:52:46.547 --> 01:52:50.378
<i>eat the rest of the dog
and wait for failure</i>

01:52:50.380 --> 01:52:53.511
<i>to reach the second tower
of the high-rise development.</i>

01:52:55.347 --> 01:52:58.411
<i>Ready to welcome its residents
into this new world...</i>

01:52:59.780 --> 01:53:00.944
<i>with open arms.</i>

01:53:08.513 --> 01:53:09.811
I heard you out there.

01:53:12.247 --> 01:53:13.445
Who were you talking to?

01:53:15.380 --> 01:53:16.478
No-one.

01:53:18.547 --> 01:53:19.612
Just the building.

01:53:23.347 --> 01:53:25.178
Margaret Thatcher: (on radio)
<i>The free enterprise system</i>

01:53:25.180 --> 01:53:28.278
<i>is a necessary
but not a sufficient condition.</i>

01:53:28.714 --> 01:53:31.411
<i>There is only one economic
system in the world</i>

01:53:31.413 --> 01:53:33.111
<i>and that is capitalism.</i>

01:53:33.380 --> 01:53:36.545
<i>The difference lies in whether
the capital is in the hands of</i>

01:53:36.547 --> 01:53:39.578
<i>the state or whether
the greater part of it</i>

01:53:39.580 --> 01:53:43.311
<i>is in the hands of people
outside of state control.</i>

01:53:43.513 --> 01:53:45.678
<i>Where there is
state capitalism,</i>

01:53:45.879 --> 01:53:49.111
<i>there will never be
political freedom.</i>
