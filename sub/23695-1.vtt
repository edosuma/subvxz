00:48.429 --> 00:50.468
They're coming.

00:57.062 --> 00:59.757
They're coming Hank.

01:00.453 --> 01:02.645
It's coming now.

01:05.116 --> 01:07.812
You ought to take care of that
Edgar.

02:51.791 --> 02:56.757
-Don't move, any of you.
-Move? I'm hit. Darn idiot fool.

03:03.006 --> 03:04.431
You all right Adam?

03:04.855 --> 03:06.389
Outside.

04:09.215 --> 04:11.286
Go ahead.

04:25.440 --> 04:28.015
All right. Get on out of here.

06:33.619 --> 06:38.858
-What's the matter with that old crock Burn?
- There's something about that grove he don't like.

06:39.130 --> 06:41.432
-Indians?
- Might be.

06:42.868 --> 06:44.446
I don't know. Best take it cautious.

06:47.377 --> 06:52.386
-We could go around.
-Why, everytime that old hag of yours gets skiddish?

06:52.811 --> 06:54.236
Why don't you put a martingale on
him?

06:54.507 --> 06:56.315
We'll just go easy.

06:57.397 --> 06:59.436
Chances are, if they was, they
would have rode out on us.

08:40.758 --> 08:42.291
Chances are, if they was, they
would have rode out on us.

08:46.037 --> 08:47.922
Yeah, something like that.

08:48.427 --> 08:51.660
This ain't no country to be set afoot.

08:53.205 --> 08:55.978
Man gets hung.

09:45.579 --> 09:50.424
Are we far enough away from that
human fruit to suit you?

10:15.794 --> 10:18.413
Dick! Come on out.

10:27.895 --> 10:31.238
-Three men coming this way.
-Three?

10:31.787 --> 10:35.098
-Well, what are they Hank?
- Is that all you seen?

10:37.491 --> 10:40.264
Ain't but three.

10:43.580 --> 10:46.999
No, there ain't no one here going to
do a little hard riding tonight.

10:47.781 --> 10:50.476
I figure we'll wait on this, old boys.
Right Indian?

10:52.135 --> 10:54.284
I ain't running from no free-range
bums.

10:55.026 --> 10:57.601
No, ain't no hands going to give us
trouble.

10:57.916 --> 11:00.952
I figure we'll let them bed down
here, as long as they are wanting.

11:01.423 --> 11:07.539
Joe, you and Hag might want to get
up above there. Cover it just in case.

11:07.782 --> 11:10.785
But if it looks clear, come on down.

11:17.802 --> 11:23.151
-We ain't taking no chances, right Dick?
-Edgar, you sit right over there like you've been.

11:31.175 --> 11:33.718
I might need some range.

11:34.374 --> 11:36.445
When ever you think it's clear.

11:46.051 --> 11:47.739
Ed?

11:52.217 --> 11:54.684
This is Dick.

12:50.333 --> 12:54.257
Howdy. Where you boys heading?

12:54.727 --> 12:58.812
-Waco.
- Waco, Texas boys.

12:58.812 --> 13:01.354
-Cowhands, are you?
-That's right.

13:04.246 --> 13:06.211
Coming from up north?

13:06.211 --> 13:09.400
Yeah, been two weeks since Pea
River.

13:15.229 --> 13:17.959
Long right yet to Waco.

13:21.318 --> 13:26.054
Well now. You boys might like to
cut a little trail dust out of your necks, huh?

13:26.251 --> 13:29.792
Why don't you step down and have
a snort with me and old Edgar.

13:30.876 --> 13:33.100
Well, that puts no pale on you little boy.

13:33.882 --> 13:35.613
Much obliged.

13:39.701 --> 13:42.003
-I'm Dick and this here is Edgar.
-Vern.

13:42.245 --> 13:44.359
-Wes.
-Otis.

13:45.096 --> 13:49.404
They call me blind Dick, on account
of one eye.

13:51.532 --> 13:55.347
There's a whole coral down there
on the side.

13:55.618 --> 13:57.459
You go on with them.

14:44.138 --> 14:47.908
- What outfit's the trail with?
- Crossfield, Seabard.

14:49.880 --> 14:53.650
Heading back there huh?
- No.

14:55.583 --> 14:59.354
Where? Waco.

15:01.441 --> 15:03.403
Just the three of you?

15:03.600 --> 15:08.258
Yeah, three's all. Five of you?

15:10.536 --> 15:19.624
-Run into any coyotes up around the Pea?
- Two or three. Signs mostly.

15:45.106 --> 15:51.694
Was just telling Otice and Vern here
how Adam fell on his knife and
that's what wrong with him.

15:54.817 --> 15:58.895
-Have a snort
- Obliged.

16:25.263 --> 16:28.957
-You boys are welcome to some of these vittles.
- Obliged.

16:30.311 --> 16:34.466
These men are going to bed down
for the night, Edgar.

16:39.483 --> 16:41.522
Come on in boys.

16:46.998 --> 16:54.781
I want you to meet, Otis, Vern and
ahhhh..Wes. Joe and Boise.

16:56.903 --> 17:01.288
Did you get any boys? Huh?
Critters.

17:01.527 --> 17:03.676
No, no, we didn't get any.

17:04.648 --> 17:07.192
A few droppings, that's all we seen.

17:08.002 --> 17:12.935
-Well beans and biscuits is it.
-That'll be fine, thank-you.

17:38.332 --> 17:41.492
They is a bunch on a scout, if I've
ever seen any.

17:41.492 --> 17:46.336
-Ain't no five ever rode out alive out of that shack.
- We could run for it.

17:46.618 --> 17:52.625
What for? They don't want no
trouble and we don't want no trouble.

17:57.370 --> 17:59.639
How about "fell on his knife".

18:00.068 --> 18:03.257
Yeah, that's a lou-lou.

18:04.769 --> 18:07.772
No, they figure we are just
cowhands passing through, that's
all.

18:08.006 --> 18:10.275
We are.

18:12.593 --> 18:15.092
They won't start nothing.

18:15.907 --> 18:21.256
They seen us coming sure. They
could have picked us off easy, if they wanted to.

18:24.501 --> 18:27.657
Hunting rabbits, ain't that one?

18:31.592 --> 18:37.215
-Maybe you want to try and bring them in?
- Maybe you do Vern?

18:55.409 --> 18:58.905
-It'll be light enough tomorrow.
-I'm ready right now.

19:25.276 --> 19:28.006
North up around Wardello would be
good for us.

19:29.015 --> 19:32.664
-They know we ain't no cowhands.
-You're too worried boys.

19:32.945 --> 19:35.170
I'd have picked them off original.

19:35.489 --> 19:38.799
They don't want no trouble. Going
to Waco, that's all they are.

19:50.172 --> 19:54.797
-Make up a pretty good mess of beans.
-I didn't mind it.

19:54.797 --> 19:58.293
Maybe you two ought to throw in
with this bunch.

19:58.651 --> 20:01.961
Sure is a softer line than what I've
got.

20:02.659 --> 20:07.745
Except I ain't anxious to wind up
trimming a tree, like the one we seen.

20:08.016 --> 20:11.632
I'll be pleased to part company
myself.

20:15.954 --> 20:18.574
Think we ought to put a watch on
them?

20:18.845 --> 20:21.465
No, we'll leave early.

20:21.774 --> 20:26.004
You'd think they'd do something for
that Adam.

20:26.899 --> 20:31.514
-What they gonna do?
-Wonder if this spread's got any riders up this way?

20:31.755 --> 20:35.405
They'll be lightening out just like us
tomorrow.

20:51.641 --> 20:56.837
-You gonna hook up in Seabar again?
- I don't know.

20:57.345 --> 21:01.543
-I was wondering....
- It's a good outfit.

21:01.777 --> 21:05.120
-How about you Wes?
- No.

21:05.515 --> 21:09.713
-Down to Cain?
-Maybe.

21:10.949 --> 21:16.419
-Didn't seem much to me.
- That's the way you seen it Vern.

21:27.598 --> 21:31.489
Ever think about trying for a spread
of your own?

21:32.107 --> 21:36.535
Once or twice.

21:37.733 --> 21:42.319
-You never get nothing growing.
-I've been doing it awile now.
Sounds like you want to squat.

21:42.319 --> 21:46.636
-You ought to throw in with this bunch Wes.
-You do all the riding you want.

21:46.636 --> 21:51.064
-Better than being afoot.
-He's got one there.

21:54.035 --> 21:56.995
Don't seem crazy to me.

21:57.272 --> 22:03.202
You start now Wes and you'd have something.
- I know it ain't crazy.

22:05.866 --> 22:11.599
I'm going to think about it, as soon
as we get out of here tomorrow.

22:37.931 --> 22:39.619
Do you know what's close by?

22:40.898 --> 22:43.781
Sierra Junction is a day or two south.

22:44.020 --> 22:46.870
Sierra Junction? Is that the one I mean.

22:47.103 --> 22:49.798
Got a place called "Golden Nugget"
in there?

22:50.032 --> 22:53.693
What don't? It's either the "Golden
Nugget" or the "Silver Dollar"....

22:53.693 --> 22:57.923
...every place between here and
Rosie's Canteena.

22:58.125 --> 23:01.128
You fixing to stop off?

23:01.362 --> 23:03.246
I was wondering if it was the one.

23:03.482 --> 23:06.562
You got something in there?

23:06.796 --> 23:11.729
Mention a saloon and you start to
dancing around.

23:11.960 --> 23:16.893
I ain't even going to get started with
you this morning, Vern.

23:38.590 --> 23:40.168
-Bout ready to head out, are they?

23:43.600 --> 23:47.370
Yeah. Anytime now.

24:25.954 --> 24:29.724
I don't know.

24:31.157 --> 24:34.698
-Are they still there?
-Yeah.

24:37.554 --> 24:39.439
You think them fools would be
bound......

24:47.690 --> 24:49.115
All right! You're surrounded.

24:50.310 --> 24:54.969
Don't make trouble for yourselves.
You got no chance.

24:57.324 --> 25:01.178
-What'll we do Dick?
-We'll have to make our play right here.

25:01.178 --> 25:02.866
What do you want with us?

25:03.414 --> 25:05.375
I guess they'll hang us.

25:05.572 --> 25:10.734
Throw out your weapons, and come
on out now or we'll open fi re.

25:12.624 --> 25:14.586
You got no chance.

25:24.417 --> 25:26.960
We won't wait forever.

25:33.050 --> 25:36.316
We'll open fire on three.

25:38.792 --> 25:40.633
One.....

25:44.688 --> 25:46.113
Two......

26:26.233 --> 26:31.001
Don't go slow. Keep the other three
pinned down and concentrate on the shack.

27:10.051 --> 27:14.984
-We got to get out.
-How?

27:19.262 --> 27:23.109
Hills are our only chance.

27:24.272 --> 27:30.125
-Where do they go anyhow, on foot?
- It's all we got.

27:33.675 --> 27:35.517
Going to be a long day.

28:30.712 --> 28:38.451
-You want to try and ride through them?
-We'll use the horses to get us into the hills.

28:45.357 --> 28:50.783
We're just sitting here waiting to get
shot, or hung.

28:55.685 --> 28:59.610
-What are they doing?
- Running back and forth looks like.

29:27.133 --> 29:29.325
Ain't going nowhere with that.

30:04.323 --> 30:06.822
Hold fire.

30:08.947 --> 30:11.414
They ain't going anywhere up there.

30:16.809 --> 30:19.462
We gotta get the rest of them
smoked out before dark.

30:20.586 --> 30:26.367
Sam, try and get up above the
shack. Ward take some of your
bunch and track the two that went up the canyon.

30:26.367 --> 30:31.058
Now don't take chances. Just track
them. They're killers.

31:06.138 --> 31:07.519
Save it.

33:32.084 --> 33:36.928
-I hope they follow us.
-Not me.

33:37.402 --> 33:38.783
We wasn't doing nothing.

33:42.451 --> 33:43.722
What's the matter with you?

33:44.532 --> 33:48.346
-Nothing's the matter. Come on
-Where to?

33:53.396 --> 33:59.096
I don't give a damn Wes. They'll
hang you just the same with Otis dead.

34:43.110 --> 34:44.918
Hold your fi re.

34:52.398 --> 34:55.400
Throw down your guns and come
out.

34:59.913 --> 35:03.683
You have no chance. There's men
above you.

35:05.000 --> 35:07.378
We're going to burn you out.

35:09.394 --> 35:11.586
What do you say?

35:15.252 --> 35:19.636
All right. Your last chance.

36:52.947 --> 36:56.257
Don't shoot. I'm coming out.

38:54.690 --> 38:57.233
Got anything to say?

39:13.959 --> 39:16.074
No?

39:39.010 --> 39:41.552
We can't just keep going up.

39:44.097 --> 39:46.869
We got to get down of f here.

39:50.494 --> 39:53.344
I know the vigilantes know that.

39:54.271 --> 39:59.039
They ain't playing Wes. They
burned them all out.

39:59.473 --> 40:02.203
Probably strung up by now.

40:02.788 --> 40:05.748
They know we can't get over this.

40:10.611 --> 40:13.417
I'm not going to hang Vern.

40:17.625 --> 40:23.829
What do they think? Burn them out!
No chances.

40:24.678 --> 40:27.988
They figured we couldn't get over
this, so we'd come to them.

40:28.185 --> 40:29.533
Just like the others done.

40:29.765 --> 40:33.382
Probably marking a trail behind us.

40:36.586 --> 40:38.548
Most of them are probably down at
that necktie party for awhile.

40:41.904 --> 40:45.368
We gotta try to go around them, or
through them.

41:25.877 --> 41:29.110
-You all right.
-Did you see them?

41:30.116 --> 41:34.161
Must be only three or four up here.
Come on then.

41:44.838 --> 41:51.732
Get on down and tell Quint that they're moving west
across the face and that you think you winged one
of them. And we'll just stay low until they box themselves in.

41:52.777 --> 41:55.813
It's going to begin to get chilly up
here in a couple of hours.

42:26.190 --> 42:31.386
-Supper Pa.
-Thank you. Tell your mother I'll be
along.

43:47.853 --> 43:50.703
-Good evening Catherine.
-Evan.

44:06.313 --> 44:08.582
We thank you Lord for this food.

44:08.818 --> 44:13.356
Your humble servants and we are
grateful for this food. Amen.

44:42.269 --> 44:44.461
It's very good. Tasty.

45:02.155 --> 45:06.386
My feet. I'm afraid to look at them.

45:06.703 --> 45:12.095
We got to keep going Wes. They
track us easy in daylight, out in the open.

45:12.291 --> 45:15.755
I can't walk much further.

45:25.278 --> 45:31.669
They was up all night, I figure. The
way they bush-whacked us this morning.

45:31.946 --> 45:36.604
We get some horses and I think
we're out of it Vern.

45:37.611 --> 45:42.544
-If there was a town around here......
- We can't go into no town.

45:42.736 --> 45:50.399
I know. But if there's a town nearby,
there's got to be nesters or a small
ranch or something.

45:51.793 --> 45:54.138
You figure we lost them?

45:55.839 --> 46:01.002
I figure we got to fi nd a place to
hide before the sun comes up
tomorrow and this ain't it.

46:03.740 --> 46:07.389
Be a shame to do all this walking
for nothing.

46:15.340 --> 46:20.075
Your one day ahead of the game
already. Better blisters than neck
burns. Come on.

46:44.591 --> 46:49.096
Hello inside. Can we have a word
with you?

46:50.873 --> 46:53.876
-Stay here.
-Be careful.

47:04.322 --> 47:11.217
-What can I do for you? - We are part of the
Citizens Vigilant Committe neighbor. You seen
anything peculiar out here?

47:11.375 --> 47:16.845
-No, you two are the only things I
seen today besides my family and a skunk.
-There are two killers lose out here.

47:17.079 --> 47:20.773
They're part of a gang. Got all of
them, but these two, and strung them up today.

47:21.010 --> 47:22.971
-Headed this way?
- No telling.

47:23.206 --> 47:26.747
They're on foot. One might be
wounded.

47:27.022 --> 47:31.680
-All right if we take a look at your stable there?
- Step down.

47:33.072 --> 47:39.660
-Can I offer you men coffee? I got a
jug of corn-whiskey inside.
- That'd be fine, thank-you, after we look around.

47:39.855 --> 47:41.466
Abigail!

47:43.131 --> 47:45.597
Bring out the corn-whiskey.

48:19.781 --> 48:21.206
Thank-you Abby.

48:25.485 --> 48:32.029
-This is my daughter Abigail.
-Good-evening Miss.

48:48.261 --> 48:51.187
I guess they ain't here.

49:06.528 --> 49:10.956
-Would you care to come inside?
-Well no thank-you. We'll go along now.

49:11.230 --> 49:15.428
We got to track these birds down.
Obliged for the drink.

49:16.587 --> 49:20.006
A pleasure meeting you Miss.

49:46.531 --> 49:50.653
-Cute little piece, wasn't she Roy?
-Ain't nothing wrong with her.

49:50.886 --> 49:54.305
I'll be getting back this way, I
believe.

50:51.315 --> 50:54.964
Don't make a sound, hear me?

50:55.747 --> 50:57.280
Sit down.

51:07.308 --> 51:14.543
You just sit there, real quiet and
you'll be fine.

51:17.367 --> 51:20.217
We don't aim to hurt nobody.

51:42.725 --> 51:48.381
Pardon me. We are chowing down.
Well, you see, we ain't eat since yesterday morning.

51:53.130 --> 51:55.169
This is good.

51:59.836 --> 52:04.341
-May I prepare the food?
-Sure.

52:16.677 --> 52:20.832
Good for our sakes, we came by
last night.

52:23.769 --> 52:27.418
-What's the matter?
- Nothing.

52:28.509 --> 52:35.436
I was just rying to figure out what
way to run?

52:35.716 --> 52:39.486
-Would you like some coffee?
-Much obliged.

52:47.084 --> 52:50.581
That's a pretty big stump out there.

52:52.094 --> 52:57.521
-What's funny?
-Nothing.

53:04.928 --> 53:09.663
-When's he come in?
- Abigail fetches him for dinner.

53:09.976 --> 53:14.054
-When's that usual?
-When the grubs ready, that's all.

53:18.301 --> 53:25.425
-They track us here, we ain't got a chance.
- This is going to be a long enough
day, without you going on.

53:27.473 --> 53:32.635
-I think we should take the horses now.
-Those vigilantes are spread out all over this country.

53:34.140 --> 53:36.211
It's ready, the food's ready.

53:39.921 --> 53:44.656
-She goes on out huh?
-That's what she usually does.

53:44.854 --> 53:52.011
-Well sure, you do what you done before, that'd be fine.
-Abby, do like they say.

53:56.223 --> 53:58.918
Your mother will be in here with us.

54:12.756 --> 54:14.597
She's there.

54:15.530 --> 54:20.770
-Dinner Pa. Thank-you Abby.
- Tell your mother, I'll be along.

54:22.429 --> 54:26.659
-She's coming back.
-You sit right there ma'm.

54:31.717 --> 54:34.376
-You did fine.
-I forgot the wash-up.

54:34.376 --> 54:37.072
- He always washes up.
-Abby!

54:38.037 --> 54:40.843
-Yes Pa.
-Where's my wash-up?

54:41.081 --> 54:42.615
Tell him you'll get it.

54:46.207 --> 54:49.243
I'm sorry Pa. I'll get it.

54:49.984 --> 54:53.480
What's gointg on inside there with
you women?

54:54.763 --> 54:56.724
Quick!

55:24.129 --> 55:27.779
-What's the matter with you?
- I'm sorry Pa, I forgot.

56:00.124 --> 56:01.735
Don't move.

56:07.986 --> 56:12.108
-Got something?
- I'm done with the, all night.

56:12.341 --> 56:15.727
-It might be all day.
- Yeah, most of us are.

56:16.002 --> 56:21.011
-They might not have come out of those mountains.
-Well, what do you want to do?`

56:21.551 --> 56:23.085
What are you going to do?

56:23.286 --> 56:28.174
Well they didn't come out between
here and the narrows, then they're
not coming out or....

56:28.373 --> 56:31.148
They got over. Slipped past us.

56:31.148 --> 56:34.381
Think I'll ride on ahead to them
squaters and get a meal.

56:34.770 --> 56:36.765
Roy told me about that "meal".

56:37.121 --> 56:44.980
-I join you when I catch up. Is that all right with you?
- Sure, the shape you're in, you ain't
seeing nothing. We'll all pack in after the day.

56:46.987 --> 56:48.565
Adios.

56:49.453 --> 56:52.764
-Aren't you going to eat Evan?
-What do you want with us?

56:52.960 --> 56:56.775
Nothing. Just don't want to make
trouble.

56:56.968 --> 57:01.199
-Listen Mister. We didn't do nothing.
-You're horse thieves.

57:01.400 --> 57:05.938
You know that. You can't just come
in here and take my stock.

57:06.256 --> 57:09.643
What'll I have. How will I work?

57:11.690 --> 57:15.767
-I'm going out to look at the horses.
-What for?

57:16.238 --> 57:19.197
-I want to see them.
-What if someone comes riding by?

57:19.398 --> 57:21.622
They ain't going to see me.

57:21.864 --> 57:24.716
You keep him in here and I'll take
her out with me.

57:24.716 --> 57:27.796
-What for?
-What do you want with her? Don't
think I'm him.

57:27.992 --> 57:31.181
-This ain't no social Wes.
-You said it was.

57:31.460 --> 57:35.034
All right, I won't take her. No, go
ahead and take her.

57:45.064 --> 57:48.802
All I'm doing is looking at your
horses.

57:53.543 --> 58:00.360
That's all Mister. I understand how
you feel.

58:01.443 --> 58:04.600
We ain't outlaws. We ain't!

58:04.835 --> 58:09.679
You just sit tight a couple of hours,
and then we'll be gone.

58:10.384 --> 58:14.276
Don't make no trouble, is what's
best for all of us.

58:50.657 --> 58:52.575
Not bad animals.

59:01.602 --> 59:04.298
You don't say much.

59:12.855 --> 59:16.275
I was getting a little cabin fever

59:21.719 --> 59:25.456
-You like it here?
- Can we go in?

59:27.654 --> 59:31.585
My father don't like it if I talk to
strangers.

59:31.585 --> 59:34.511
He don't mean nothing to me.

59:38.329 --> 59:45.684
-They're going to hang us. You think that's right?
- I don't know. It ain't up to me.

59:48.002 --> 59:51.817
You just do what? What's right with
your Pa? Is that all you care about?

59:52.049 --> 59:54.515
I can't say.

01:00:02.609 --> 01:00:07.344
-How old are you?
-18, I reckon.

01:00:08.274 --> 01:00:12.812
-You wanting to steal our stock.
-That's ain't my problem.

01:00:13.091 --> 01:00:17.716
-Tell them vigilantes, they're the ones.
- It's the wrong thing to do.

01:00:17.716 --> 01:00:26.298
What's right? Hang? You tell me.
They killed the best friend I ever had.

01:00:33.016 --> 01:00:35.317
We ought to go in.

01:00:39.606 --> 01:00:43.913
When I say, is when I want to go in.

01:00:58.913 --> 01:01:01.643
You going to eat that?

01:01:23.270 --> 01:01:29.123
-Pretty good horses.
- As long as they get us out of this part of the country.

01:01:29.397 --> 01:01:34.637
-You go out and beat that old stump
to death, then I won't have to hear it.
- I want to stay in here.

01:01:34.947 --> 01:01:40.373
Go out. Don't mean no trouble.
Look better if you out there working.

01:01:45.738 --> 01:01:48.511
Don't worry about them.

01:02:16.222 --> 01:02:21.308
-He sure is on the tick.
-Sure he's on the peck.

01:02:21.579 --> 01:02:25.075
Stealing horses is all we mean to
him. Can't blame him.

01:02:27.860 --> 01:02:31.324
-You mind if I get some sleep Vern?
-Go on.

01:02:33.872 --> 01:02:38.959
-This is my bed.
- No, go on.

01:03:01.582 --> 01:03:04.925
-How long has he been going at
that stump?

01:03:05.281 --> 01:03:09.249
-Yesterday morning.
-You like it here?

01:03:10.638 --> 01:03:12.710
It's all right.

01:03:15.032 --> 01:03:20.041
-Kind of lonesome for a woman.
-Same as for a man.

01:03:21.005 --> 01:03:23.888
-I reckon.

01:03:26.979 --> 01:03:30.826
Seems to me what you do is
lonesome.

01:03:34.917 --> 01:03:37.844
I guess you'd be right. I don't know.

01:03:40.968 --> 01:03:46.207
That man last night, said they
hanged some of your bunch.

01:03:49.023 --> 01:03:54.109
-It ain't my bunch ma'm.
-What are you going to do Vern, talk?

01:03:56.422 --> 01:03:59.841
Ah, you can go to sleep. Beats me
anyways.

01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:03.086
Well I guess I can't.

01:04:06.596 --> 01:04:09.063
If you ladies got anything to do, you
go on.

01:04:29.951 --> 01:04:37.185
Hey Wes, what was that with you
and Cain?

01:04:40.202 --> 01:04:47.447
-Damn, what do you want to do, talk is all?
- Better than sitting here all day listening to myself.

01:04:47.447 --> 01:04:52.456
I don't know. You want to play
checkers?

01:04:54.423 --> 01:04:58.314
-You got any checkers.
- Yes we do.

01:04:58.546 --> 01:05:01.582
Can we use them?

01:05:24.174 --> 01:05:29.984
-Playing checkers.....Stealing horses.....
-What's the matter with you?

01:05:30.225 --> 01:05:35.541
-Just don't seem to be no end to it.
- No use to that.

01:05:35.813 --> 01:05:42.247
-Strikes me as peculiar just the same.
- Why's that?

01:05:42.403 --> 01:05:47.675
Sitting here, playing checkers.

01:05:47.953 --> 01:05:52.346
While there is a bunch of men out
there, looking to string us up.

01:05:52.346 --> 01:05:58.386
-Why don't you put a tune to it?
-We're in the scout boy.

01:05:59.399 --> 01:06:03.169
You can't cash in, can you?

01:06:03.638 --> 01:06:06.520
Getting strung up is better?

01:06:07.299 --> 01:06:10.412
Nobody is just going to put a name
to me, and that's it.

01:06:20.633 --> 01:06:24.678
I'd like to take a whack at that
stump myself.

01:06:26.221 --> 01:06:29.027
Come on. Play!

01:06:42.446 --> 01:06:45.712
I don't know. I'm going to think
about it.

01:06:46.338 --> 01:06:48.607
You'll never get nothing growing.

01:06:49.229 --> 01:06:52.923
This is the less work I done on a
weekday, since I was four.

01:06:53.121 --> 01:06:55.313
Unelss I was sick.

01:06:55.626 --> 01:06:58.892
-What's so funny?
-They ain't playing Wes.

01:06:59.133 --> 01:07:01.248
They burned down my house.

01:07:03.295 --> 01:07:07.450
-It's your move Vern.
-I know it.

01:07:08.228 --> 01:07:13.117
-You're horse thieves.
- Indians?

01:07:15.127 --> 01:07:18.130
-Well come on, play.
- Where you been at Vern?

01:07:18.711 --> 01:07:21.089
I moved already.

01:07:32.315 --> 01:07:35.548
He stopped. See what he's doing.

01:07:35.745 --> 01:07:41.478
No, we ain't found them ain't.
Probably won't if we don't get them today.

01:07:41.950 --> 01:07:46.257
-Where's your women folk?
- Inside. Baking today.

01:07:46.767 --> 01:07:49.617
Baking? That right?

01:07:54.860 --> 01:07:59.245
Well I out scouting. The main body
is moving out this way.

01:07:59.485 --> 01:08:02.027
What the hell they talking about Vern.

01:08:02.568 --> 01:08:04.946
Well the side buster is spilling his beans.

01:08:05.420 --> 01:08:08.576
-Something the matter with you?
-No.

01:08:09.659 --> 01:08:12.662
You're acting mighty peculiar for
nothing the matter.

01:08:15.054 --> 01:08:18.747
-They're here!
- Yeah, that's what I thought.

01:08:18.908 --> 01:08:21.604
-Where're they at? In the house?
-They got the women. What are we going to do?

01:08:21.798 --> 01:08:24.176
Now, you don't look at the house.

01:08:24.496 --> 01:08:28.966
You start pointing off behind me.
I'm just going to ease out of here and get some help.

01:08:28.966 --> 01:08:32.858
Act like you're giving me directions
to some place, like I'm just passing through.

01:08:34.401 --> 01:08:36.702
You just go on back to work, like it
was nothing.

01:08:36.944 --> 01:08:39.212
Make them come out to you to fi nd
out what happened.

01:08:39.448 --> 01:08:41.916
Stall them.

01:08:41.916 --> 01:08:47.769
-We going to leave him go?
-Well, ain't no other way.

01:08:48.005 --> 01:08:54.318
Doing us a favor. Getting dumb-
enough to go for whatever it is.

01:08:55.057 --> 01:08:58.323
As soon as he's out of sight.

01:09:00.529 --> 01:09:03.029
Stay inside.

01:09:08.082 --> 01:09:09.846
Come on, let's go.

01:09:15.174 --> 01:09:17.059
Hey, stay out of there.

01:09:29.935 --> 01:09:32.357
They're taking our stock.

01:09:41.689 --> 01:09:44.154
Hold it right there!

01:09:53.443 --> 01:09:57.641
-What do you think?
-Take two men and fi nd out. It
could be anything.

01:11:41.582 --> 01:11:45.475
-We're sorry about this ma'm.
- I hope you hang them.

01:11:45.475 --> 01:11:48.095
Don't worry. They've
seen their last sunrise.

01:11:48.095 --> 01:11:51.592
-One of them is shot.
-They won't get far now.

01:13:38.740 --> 01:13:41.929
-Let me down.
-No we can't Vern.

01:13:44.597 --> 01:13:46.975
I ain't going.

01:13:52.267 --> 01:13:55.883
Two won't make it on that horse.

01:13:58.086 --> 01:14:04.630
I bought it, Wes. Go on.

01:14:05.678 --> 01:14:12.222
-I can't just leave you.
- You have to do that boy. Can't you see that?

01:14:13.193 --> 01:14:15.462
Go on!

01:16:00.831 --> 01:16:02.519
We got them now.

01:17:19.989 --> 01:17:22.367
What about the other one?
