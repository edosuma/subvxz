13:43.323 --> 13:44.741
<i>- Last night,
during a police raid</i>

13:44.866 --> 13:48.495
<i>of a known Italian crime boss's
garage of stolen cars,</i>

13:48.620 --> 13:50.914
<i>a police officer was taken hostage</i>

13:51.039 --> 13:53.875
<i>by one of the scumbags
that he was trying to arrest.</i>

13:54.000 --> 13:56.920
<i>He's with us this morning.
Perhaps he has something to say this morning.</i>

13:57.420 --> 13:59.464
<i>Mr. Ward, Poirier, Claude.</i>

13:59.589 --> 14:02.425
<i>How did a low-level scumbag</i>

14:02.551 --> 14:06.179
<i>manage to kidnap a highly trained officer
like yourself?</i>

14:07.138 --> 14:08.723
- Uh...

14:08.849 --> 14:12.018
<i>When we entered the garage,</i>

14:12.143 --> 14:17.440
<i>we were surprised
by the pushback we encountered.</i>

14:17.566 --> 14:19.985
<i>Many of them were armed.</i>

14:20.110 --> 14:23.572
<i>- Didn't they teach you how to deal with that
at the Ontarian Nicolet,</i>

14:23.697 --> 14:26.950
<i>that sometimes criminals might be armed?</i>

14:27.075 --> 14:29.077
- Uh, well...

14:29.911 --> 14:33.456
<i>I'm sorry, but I don't know...
Who's Nicolet?</i>

14:33.582 --> 14:36.751
- Nicolet is the Quebec police school.

14:36.877 --> 14:39.337
<i>Do you want me
to "conti-news" in English?</i>

14:39.462 --> 14:40.672
<i>- No, that's all right!</i>

14:40.797 --> 14:45.093
<i>But could you please speak
a little more slowly?</i>

14:46.720 --> 14:49.014
<i>- Is this my stag party?</i>

14:52.100 --> 14:53.435
- Where the fuck were you?

14:53.560 --> 14:55.145
(Both grunting)

14:56.229 --> 14:57.689
(Groaning)

14:57.814 --> 14:59.566
<i>- Calice!</i>

14:59.691 --> 15:01.067
(Sighing)

15:01.192 --> 15:02.861
<i>Can you tell your monkey here</i>

15:02.986 --> 15:05.697
<i>that he only needs to hit me
if I won't talk?</i>

15:05.822 --> 15:07.866
<i>He doesn't seem to understand the rules!</i>

15:15.248 --> 15:18.293
<i>When we got busted last night,
things got crazy.</i>

15:19.586 --> 15:22.172
<i>I managed to disarm one of them
and kidnapped him.</i>

15:22.297 --> 15:25.342
<i>- He made me drive to the Old Port.</i>

15:25.467 --> 15:28.678
<i>I was afraid he was going to kill me
and leave me there.</i>

15:28.803 --> 15:30.388
<i>I braked suddenly,</i>

15:30.513 --> 15:32.641
<i>and he hit the back of the seat.</i>

15:32.766 --> 15:35.518
<i>- I dropped the gun.
Punched him in the head.</i>

15:35.644 --> 15:38.146
<i>He lost control of the truck, and I jumped.</i>

15:38.271 --> 15:39.731
<i>- When I got out of the vehicle,</i>

15:39.856 --> 15:41.650
<i>he was running,
so I shot at him.</i>

15:41.775 --> 15:46.738
<i>- Luckily, he only winged me.
So, I kept on running.</i>

15:47.155 --> 15:49.658
<i>You don't want to know
what my night was like!</i>

15:49.783 --> 15:52.160
(Chuckling)
- No, I'm dying to know.

15:54.788 --> 15:56.998
Seriously, I'm curious.

15:58.667 --> 16:01.628
<i>- I didn't want to take a chance
by going somewhere and getting pinched,</i>

16:01.753 --> 16:03.964
<i>so I spent the night outside.</i>

16:05.256 --> 16:07.258
<i>I stole a hoodie off a bum,</i>

16:07.384 --> 16:11.262
<i>pounded a few cups of coffee,
'cause I knew it'd be a long night.</i>

16:11.805 --> 16:13.723
<i>I made myself a nice Band-Aid
with some napkins.</i>

16:13.848 --> 16:16.476
<i>All I could find for the pain
was some ecstasy.</i>

16:16.810 --> 16:18.228
That's it.

16:18.353 --> 16:19.604
<i>- You're a hero!</i>

16:20.355 --> 16:22.107
<i>When I first saw you,</i>

16:22.524 --> 16:24.943
<i>I thought,
"Here's just another Anglo,"</i>

16:25.068 --> 16:27.112
<i>but you're much more than that.</i>

16:28.238 --> 16:29.656
<i>- Thank you.</i>

16:30.323 --> 16:33.284
<i>- This is the composite sketch
of the scumbag.</i>

16:33.702 --> 16:38.581
<i>If you see him, call my voicemail
and leave it a message.</i>

16:38.707 --> 16:39.958
<i>10-4!</i>

16:40.083 --> 16:42.043
(Groaning)

16:42.502 --> 16:44.587
<i>- You little prick!</i>

16:45.547 --> 16:47.215
<i>- Looks real, Boss.</i>

16:47.340 --> 16:49.092
(Groaning)

16:55.140 --> 16:56.808
- Doctor's here?

16:56.933 --> 16:59.269
- Yeah, he's standby.

17:01.354 --> 17:03.189
- Tsk!

17:03.314 --> 17:05.275
Well, go get him.

17:08.028 --> 17:09.404
(Breathing heavily)

17:13.700 --> 17:15.827
- When do you wanna wrap it up?

17:15.952 --> 17:17.119
- I don't.

17:17.244 --> 17:19.372
It can't just look real. It has to be real.

17:19.497 --> 17:21.833
So we follow protocol.
Everything by the book.

17:21.958 --> 17:24.294
There's too much riding on this already.

17:24.419 --> 17:26.253
- So, you really shot your friend?

17:26.378 --> 17:28.173
- Yes, I did.

17:28.298 --> 17:31.092
- Just to be sure, boss,
we're not friends, right?

17:31.217 --> 17:33.344
(All laughing)

17:37.974 --> 17:40.935
<i>- Doc, go easy
when you pull the bandage off.</i>

17:41.061 --> 17:42.729
(Groaning)

17:54.574 --> 17:56.534
What the fuck?

17:56.993 --> 17:58.787
<i>What's he doing with that?</i>

17:58.912 --> 18:00.830
- Hey, hey. Shut up.

18:03.750 --> 18:06.044
(Groaning)

18:16.554 --> 18:17.847
<i>- What's he doing?</i>

18:18.598 --> 18:20.350
(Beeping)

18:22.560 --> 18:25.522
<i>- Loaded with caffeine.
Amphetamines, too.</i>

18:26.147 --> 18:27.107
- Hmm!

18:30.276 --> 18:31.986
<i>- He needs stitches.</i>

18:32.362 --> 18:33.238
- Mike...

18:33.363 --> 18:36.366
Come on, man. Untie him.
Get him a drink. Let's go.

18:40.662 --> 18:42.413
<i>- Thanks, Michel.</i>

18:42.539 --> 18:46.000
<i>- Call me Michel one more time,
and I'll rip your head off.</i>

18:47.627 --> 18:52.715
<i>- Michel, I'll have a scotch
with just one ice cube, please.</i>

18:52.841 --> 18:54.551
(Chuckling)

18:56.010 --> 18:58.179
- Ah! It's good to have you back, Davey.

18:58.304 --> 19:01.724
I don't want you to worry.
The doctor's gonna fix you up.

19:01.850 --> 19:02.934
And here...

19:03.977 --> 19:07.605
Buy yourself some new clothes,
'cause you smell like a homeless hooker.

19:07.730 --> 19:09.107
Your apartment's burned.

19:09.232 --> 19:11.734
So Mikey's gonna set you up
with a room upstairs. Yeah?

19:11.860 --> 19:13.611
<i>- Thanks, you won't regret it.</i>

19:13.736 --> 19:15.905
- Oh, I have no regrets.

19:16.030 --> 19:19.576
It's the people who fuck with me
who have regrets.

19:24.831 --> 19:26.833
<i>- Where's that scotch, Michel?</i>

19:42.932 --> 19:44.893
(Breathing shallowly)

20:05.872 --> 20:07.498
(Sighing)

20:07.624 --> 20:09.918
<i>- It's not the Ritz,
but your neighbours are cute!</i>

20:11.961 --> 20:14.464
<i>After last night,
we're changing things up.</i>

20:14.589 --> 20:18.092
<i>- What do you mean?
- Deliver right to the main garage.</i>

20:18.718 --> 20:20.845
<i>We need 25 cars in 5 days.</i>

20:21.179 --> 20:24.474
<i>- 25 in 5? We just lost half our team!</i>

20:24.599 --> 20:26.809
<i>- I've got new guys starting tonight.</i>

20:26.935 --> 20:28.895
<i>- The deadline is new. What's the deal?</i>

20:29.020 --> 20:31.022
<i>- It's none of your goddamn business!</i>

20:31.147 --> 20:34.025
<i>You're early!
- I'm doing the day shift.</i>

20:34.150 --> 20:35.485
Oh!

20:35.610 --> 20:38.363
<i>I thought no guys
were allowed upstairs!</i>

20:38.488 --> 20:40.240
<i>- He's your roommate for the week.</i>

20:40.990 --> 20:44.744
<i>- You can put him in my room
if he's afraid to sleep alone.</i>

20:44.869 --> 20:46.371
<i>I don't bite.</i>

20:47.747 --> 20:49.874
<i>And I like bad boys!</i>

20:52.460 --> 20:54.379
<i>- Your rockstar suite.</i>

20:54.504 --> 20:55.964
- Wow!

20:56.923 --> 20:59.759
<i>Are you the one I call for room service?</i>

20:59.884 --> 21:01.302
<i>- Don't touch my girls.</i>

21:01.427 --> 21:03.846
<i>You owe me a pickup truck.
I want it by 3:00.</i>

21:03.972 --> 21:05.390
<i>- Are you fucking kidding me?</i>

21:06.516 --> 21:08.017
- Try me.

21:10.478 --> 21:12.438
(Electronics beeping)

21:16.150 --> 21:19.153
(Engine revving,
tires screeching)

21:24.450 --> 21:26.286
- Oh!

21:28.955 --> 21:30.248
You trust him?

21:30.373 --> 21:32.667
- Well, he's one of our best.

21:32.792 --> 21:34.752
- No, that's not what I asked.

21:37.672 --> 21:40.383
- Yeah, I trust him.

21:43.052 --> 21:44.637
- You vouch for him?

21:47.640 --> 21:49.142
- Yes.

21:51.352 --> 21:52.812
- It's on you, then.

22:18.338 --> 22:19.714
- Wow!

22:19.839 --> 22:22.759
You're deep undercover.

22:23.301 --> 22:25.678
<i>- There's no time for your jokes.</i>

22:27.764 --> 22:29.432
- One man...

22:30.933 --> 22:35.730
sacrifices everything
and faces destiny

22:35.855 --> 22:40.735
to clean the filthy business
of the curling world.

22:40.860 --> 22:43.029
He's gonna clean it,

22:43.154 --> 22:46.366
armed with a gun and a broom.

22:46.491 --> 22:49.952
Martin Ward is...

22:51.245 --> 22:52.622
<i>Balls of Stone.</i>

22:52.747 --> 22:54.415
(Snorting)

22:54.540 --> 22:56.209
(Both laughing)

22:58.711 --> 23:00.630
- How's the shoulder?

23:00.755 --> 23:01.798
<i>- It's OK.</i>

23:01.923 --> 23:05.301
<i>You didn't have to go that far,
but it worked. They believed me.</i>

23:05.426 --> 23:08.262
<i>I was scared shitless.
I thought they were going to kill me!</i>

23:08.388 --> 23:09.931
- Hmm...

23:10.056 --> 23:12.350
<i>- And thanks for the composite sketch!</i>

23:12.475 --> 23:14.727
<i>It was so good, I had to...</i>

23:14.852 --> 23:16.312
(Chuckling)

23:19.565 --> 23:21.442
Wow!

23:22.485 --> 23:25.029
<i>Federal gets quite the budget!</i>
- Mm-hmm!

23:25.154 --> 23:27.949
<i>- We'd be two of us in a garden shed
with an iPhone 4.</i>

23:28.074 --> 23:29.492
(Chuckling)

23:29.617 --> 23:31.828
- OK, time to information share.

23:31.953 --> 23:33.996
What do you know about DiPietro?

23:34.122 --> 23:36.833
<i>- He's been working
for the Caprese family forever.</i>

23:36.958 --> 23:38.960
<i>But I was recruited by Mike Dubois.</i>

23:39.085 --> 23:40.753
<i>It's only been three months</i>

23:40.878 --> 23:44.132
<i>since DiPietro showed up
and started running things.</i>

23:44.257 --> 23:46.843
- What we've gathered
is that DiPietro's been sidelined

23:46.968 --> 23:49.804
by the godfather himself,
and he's none too happy about it.

23:49.929 --> 23:52.974
- You think he's ready to flip?
- We hope that's the case, yes.

23:53.099 --> 23:57.270
We squeeze him hard enough,
he gives us everybody at the top of the food chain.

23:57.687 --> 24:01.190
<i>- That's why he wants a side business.</i>
- But it doesn't make any sense.

24:01.315 --> 24:04.610
Why dabble in stolen cars
when there's more money to be had in drugs?

24:04.735 --> 24:08.489
<i>- I tried explaining it to you,
but then you started shooting at me.</i>

24:08.614 --> 24:11.492
<i>They've been talking about
a client for a while.</i>

24:11.617 --> 24:16.038
<i>I don't know what or who it is,
but I know it's big.</i>

24:16.622 --> 24:20.960
<i>The only change is the deadline:
they want 25 cars in 5 days.</i>

24:21.085 --> 24:24.464
<i>And we're not going
to the transit warehouse anymore.</i>

24:24.589 --> 24:28.009
<i>We go straight to the main garage.
Here's the address.</i>

24:30.845 --> 24:33.097
- Well, then, from now on,

24:33.222 --> 24:36.017
I'm gonna be in your head 24/7.

24:36.142 --> 24:39.604
With this little device,
you'll be able to hear me.

24:39.729 --> 24:43.399
If anything goes wrong,
I can be there within minutes.

24:46.611 --> 24:48.112
You put it in your ear.

24:48.237 --> 24:49.906
<i>- I know, but how--</i>

24:50.031 --> 24:52.074
- Turn it on here.
- OK.

24:53.367 --> 24:55.161
<i>And you'll hear me when I talk?</i>

24:55.286 --> 24:56.829
- Oh yes!

24:57.872 --> 24:59.248
- Cool!

25:01.167 --> 25:03.503
(Chuckling)

25:03.628 --> 25:05.922
<i>That was some reunion!</i>

25:06.464 --> 25:09.383
<i>What are the odds that you'd raid
the spot I was working undercover?</i>

25:09.509 --> 25:12.553
- Fairly high, I would imagine,
since our job depends

25:12.678 --> 25:15.223
on being in the wrong place
at the right time.

25:15.348 --> 25:16.307
(Both chuckling)

25:17.975 --> 25:19.977
<i>- And you? How's the family?</i>

25:20.102 --> 25:21.979
- Never better.

25:22.104 --> 25:25.983
My sister married an 86-year-old
somewhat senile banker.

25:26.108 --> 25:28.319
Lives in Switzerland now.

25:28.444 --> 25:29.445
<i>- And Jonathan?</i>

25:29.570 --> 25:32.448
- Your guess is as good as mine.

25:32.573 --> 25:34.742
Last I heard, he was in Montreal.

25:34.867 --> 25:36.327
<i>- You want me to find him?</i>

25:36.452 --> 25:40.540
- Oh, Dave, finding people is easy for me.

25:41.749 --> 25:43.376
Communicating with them,

25:43.501 --> 25:46.170
apparently, I haven't mastered yet.

25:47.755 --> 25:50.800
<i>- Kids aren't easy.</i>

25:52.677 --> 25:55.429
<i>Gabrielle is living
in my old apartment upstairs.</i>

25:55.555 --> 25:56.764
- That's wonderful, no?

25:56.889 --> 25:59.100
<i>- It would be, if it weren't for Cousin Itt.</i>

25:59.225 --> 26:02.228
<i>- Cousin Itt?
- Her boyfriend.</i>

26:02.687 --> 26:05.982
<i>It's like all he does is grow hair.</i>

26:06.399 --> 26:08.442
(Grunting)
(Laughing)

26:09.485 --> 26:12.071
<i>It's hard to tell
if he's speaking or burping.</i>

26:12.196 --> 26:14.782
<i>Gabrielle's good.
She applied to Nicolet.</i>

26:14.907 --> 26:17.785
- The police academy!
- Mm-hmm!

26:18.494 --> 26:19.912
<i>All right, I have to go!</i>

26:20.037 --> 26:23.583
<i>I only have a couple hours to find a pickup truck.</i>
- Well, I'm right behind you.

26:23.708 --> 26:25.876
Don't forget to put your earpiece in.

26:26.002 --> 26:28.045
<i>- So you'll be in my head 24/7?</i>

26:28.170 --> 26:31.132
- Well, I might give you some rest
from time to time,

26:31.257 --> 26:33.551
considering it's been uninhabited for so long.

26:33.676 --> 26:35.428
(Laughing)
- Wow!

I'm worried about you!</i>

26:42.268 --> 26:45.021
<i>- You're full of shit!
That's not Price's truck!</i>

26:45.146 --> 26:47.857
<i>- You don't believe me?
Check out what was inside!</i>

26:50.776 --> 26:51.652
<i>His new mask!</i>

26:53.029 --> 26:55.615
<i>Check it out! It's awesome!</i>

26:56.782 --> 26:58.034
(All laughing)

26:59.952 --> 27:03.706
<i>Price is a man of few words.
Now he'll be speechless for months!</i>

27:03.831 --> 27:05.833
Hey, Mike!

27:05.958 --> 27:07.835
<i>Listen to this! You'll die laughing!</i>

27:07.960 --> 27:11.589
<i>- The whole building heard your story already.
And you'll tell it 40 more times anyway!</i>

27:11.714 --> 27:14.175
- Ah, Mike!
<i>You're a ray of sunshine!</i>

27:14.300 --> 27:16.385
<i>You should do ads for orange juice!</i>

27:17.011 --> 27:20.848
<i>- You have to bring his mask back!
He'll be off his game without it!</i>

27:21.557 --> 27:26.520
<i>- You want me to go up to him
after practice and say:</i>

27:26.646 --> 27:28.230
<i>"Excuse me, Mr. Price.</i>

27:28.356 --> 27:30.900
<i>I stole your truck, and this was inside.</i>

27:31.025 --> 27:35.363
<i>I know goalies are as superstitious
as bingo ladies,</i>

27:35.488 --> 27:38.866
<i>so I brought it back so you don't
end up puking everywhere."</i>

27:39.408 --> 27:41.911
<i>- Put it in the mail.
- I'll bring it to him.</i>

27:43.829 --> 27:46.457
<i>- You think I'd give it to you?
- Sure!</i>

27:46.582 --> 27:49.752
<i>- In two weeks, I'll find it at the flea market!</i>
(Scoffing)

27:50.169 --> 27:52.088
<i>He once sold
his sister's washer and dryer...</i>

27:54.340 --> 27:55.841
<i>for three mags!</i>

28:01.681 --> 28:03.224

- First time.

28:07.353 --> 28:09.063
<i>That's good!</i>

28:11.065 --> 28:14.276
<i>I'm sure they were the big clients
I was telling you about.</i>

28:14.402 --> 28:16.987
<i>They were so young, though!
The oldest might've been 25.</i>

28:17.113 --> 28:21.325
- I still can't get my head around this.
Why cars? Why not drugs?

28:21.450 --> 28:25.788
<i>- Because there's a demand!
There's a market for everything.</i>

28:25.913 --> 28:29.417
- You know you can actually buy
clean urine on the Internet?

28:29.542 --> 28:32.962
<i>- Then, I'm surprised there's no
high-school-diploma pushers in Quebec!</i>

28:33.087 --> 28:35.798
(Both chuckling)
- OK, let's find out where they're from.

28:35.923 --> 28:37.967

28:41.303 --> 28:43.723
<i>If I shove this up your ass,
what will you do?</i>

28:44.265 --> 28:48.102
<i>- That's MC, our computer whiz.</i>

28:48.227 --> 28:50.271
<i>MC, David.</i>

28:51.147 --> 28:54.442
<i>- Some cowboy move, stealing Price's truck,
but I like your style.</i>

28:55.526 --> 28:59.655
<i>You and me are going to make
a fucking dangerous team!</i>

28:59.780 --> 29:01.532
<i>- A team?
- That's right!</i>

29:01.657 --> 29:04.285
<i>I'm your eyes, your ears,
your hands, your everything!</i>

29:04.410 --> 29:07.037

29:07.163 --> 29:09.540
<i>what I will do, goddammit! -</i>

29:09.665 --> 29:12.543
<i>is hack into the system

29:12.918 --> 29:15.296
<i>I can see in that look
you're wondering how, right?</i>

29:15.421 --> 29:17.339
<i>- Oh no. That's not what I'm wondering.</i>

29:17.465 --> 29:21.635
<i>- Who has poles and wires everywhere?
Who?</i>

29:21.761 --> 29:23.804
<i>Bell and Hydro-Québec.</i> Boom!

29:23.929 --> 29:27.224
<i>If I hack into their system and bypass it...</i>

29:29.351 --> 29:32.188
Come on, baby! <i>Allez!</i>

29:32.313 --> 29:35.524
Bang! Yes, fucker!

29:42.114 --> 29:45.284

You wanted a Macintosh?

29:45.409 --> 29:48.662
<i>I'll give you my Macintosh!</i>

29:49.371 --> 29:51.665

As of now, we're a team!</i>

30:04.720 --> 30:07.723
<i>I need help with the computers.
Their security is tight.</i>

30:07.848 --> 30:09.892
<i>- I don't know anything about computers.</i>

30:10.017 --> 30:14.396
<i>- It's easy. Just take pictures of their system.
- Oh, OK.</i>

30:14.522 --> 30:17.525
<i>- Computers, wiring,
external hard drives, modems...</i>

30:17.650 --> 30:19.360
<i>Whatever you can.</i> Name it.

30:19.485 --> 30:23.697
<i>- Sure. Hello, Minnie Mouse?
I'm undercover, you know.</i>

30:23.823 --> 30:26.492
<i>You think I can walk around
snapping pictures with my phone?</i>

30:26.617 --> 30:28.661

30:46.554 --> 30:48.639
<i>If they start losing because of it,</i>

30:48.764 --> 30:51.851
<i>the city will go nuts,
and people will lose their jobs!</i>

30:52.518 --> 30:54.144
- Hmm...
- Uh...

30:54.728 --> 30:56.230
<i>Sorry, my mistake.</i>

30:56.355 --> 31:00.109
<i>Leafs fan.
I can't trust you with this!</i>

31:00.234 --> 31:02.069

31:25.217 --> 31:29.471
- Really fucking weird, but awesome!

31:30.723 --> 31:32.516
- OK.

31:32.641 --> 31:35.436
- David, your camera's too low. Get it up.

31:38.105 --> 31:38.981
Perfect.

31:39.106 --> 31:40.024
<i>- OK, guys...</i>

31:40.149 --> 31:42.109
I know we're asking a lot here,

31:42.234 --> 31:45.279

31:45.404 --> 31:47.573

31:47.698 --> 31:48.365

<i>- If you think you're being followed,

31:51.243 --> 31:55.414
<i>Ditch the car and call me at the bar.
Don't call my cell. Is that clear?</i>

31:55.539 --> 31:56.957
<i>- What if we're arrested?</i>

31:57.082 --> 32:00.836
- OK, look, anything happens to you out there,

32:00.961 --> 32:03.297
<i>I want you to remember I got your bail...</i>

32:03.422 --> 32:04.798

32:07.343 --> 32:08.802
(Both chuckling)

32:08.928 --> 32:11.639
Now, for those of you

<i>I'm actually quite a nice guy...</i>

32:14.808 --> 32:15.851
until I'm not.

32:15.976 --> 32:18.020
So, here's what makes me not:

32:18.145 --> 32:22.107
You talk about the job
outside of these 4 walls. Yeah?

32:22.232 --> 32:24.860
You know, you shoot your mouth off

32:24.985 --> 32:27.488
to impress your buddies, get laid, huh?

32:27.613 --> 32:29.198
(Chuckling)

32:29.323 --> 32:33.702
<i>Oh, you know, another thing
that really gets me</i>

32:33.827 --> 32:37.373
<i>is when you don't show your face
when I expect to see it.</i>

32:38.874 --> 32:41.085
<i>- What happens when you're not a nice guy?</i>

32:41.210 --> 32:43.420
(Laughing and stammering)

32:43.545 --> 32:45.631

He's one of the team now.
Let's go. Help him up!

33:33.178 --> 33:36.807
- The kid's OK. He's gonna be OK, David.
I need those pictures.

33:39.852 --> 33:43.188
David, I really need those pictures.

<i>- No, I just wanted to ask Mike</i>

33:57.619 --> 33:59.246

<i>- OK, David, I don't want to be a bugger, but go...</i>
- You OK?

34:27.608 --> 34:28.609
<i>- Sure.</i>

34:30.152 --> 34:33.362

an electric shock sometimes.</i>

34:33.489 --> 34:36.949
<i>Give the Miatas to the new guys.
I want the high-paying stuff.</i>

34:37.076 --> 34:39.786

I don't wanna see that guy's face.</i>

34:46.918 --> 34:48.879

34:49.004 --> 34:50.047
<i>- A big problem.</i>

34:50.172 --> 34:52.507

34:52.632 --> 34:54.510

<i>I'll be at the bar if you change your mind.</i>

39:11.183 --> 39:13.393
<i>- Mike wants me to take care of them.</i>

39:14.311 --> 39:16.688
<i>- Who are they?
- I don't know.</i>

39:16.813 --> 39:18.065
<i>I don't ask questions,</i>

39:18.190 --> 39:20.817
<i>as long as they tip well
and take it easy on the groping.</i>

39:21.443 --> 39:26.239
<i>- Gina? Jen? Can I have another?
This one's empty.</i>

39:26.365 --> 39:29.451
<i>A double. And three more
for my friends over there.</i>

39:29.576 --> 39:30.702
<i>- What are you doing?</i>

39:30.827 --> 39:33.080
<i>- Five minutes, tops!</i>

39:36.416 --> 39:38.085
<i>- Jen, do you have any matches?</i>

39:44.674 --> 39:46.301
<i>- Uh-oh! They're angry!</i>

39:46.426 --> 39:48.136
<i>Don't worry, it's just liquid!</i>

39:48.261 --> 39:50.639
<i>Dry it off with your turban!</i>
- Yo, what's he saying?

39:50.764 --> 39:53.141
<i>- Get the hell out!
- I'll take care of it.</i>

39:53.266 --> 39:54.226
(Groaning)

39:54.351 --> 39:57.437
<i>Come on!
- What are you doing, man?</i>

39:57.562 --> 39:59.648
- It's all right.
- What's his problem?

39:59.773 --> 40:00.774
- That's nothing.

40:07.280 --> 40:08.949
<i>- Salut!</i>

40:09.074 --> 40:10.325
- OK!

40:11.910 --> 40:14.996
<i>Go home and come back tomorrow.</i>

40:15.122 --> 40:16.289
- OK!
- OK?

40:16.415 --> 40:18.792
<i>- That way? Tomorrow?
- Good night!</i>

40:22.421 --> 40:24.464
- I'm here.

40:25.841 --> 40:28.552
<i>- Listen, big shot!
- Is he still here?</i>

40:28.969 --> 40:33.014
<i>- You guys can't tell me what to do
in my own--</i>

40:33.140 --> 40:34.474
(Grunting)

41:12.804 --> 41:13.930
<i>- Do you have a light?</i>

41:22.814 --> 41:25.066
(Muttering indistinctly)

41:45.504 --> 41:46.963
(Coughing)

41:57.349 --> 41:58.808
<i>I'm going inside.</i>

42:09.361 --> 42:13.240
- David, you won't fucking believe this!

42:17.827 --> 42:19.454
<i>- You sure about that?</i>

42:19.579 --> 42:20.956
- No, Dave, I'm not 100% sure,

42:21.081 --> 42:24.167
but seeing as there were
3 American flags hanging off the building,

42:24.292 --> 42:27.420
2 armed Marines at the door,
oh, and yes, a gold plaque that says:

42:27.546 --> 42:29.631
"United States of America Consulate,"

42:29.756 --> 42:31.591
I think I might be onto something.

42:31.967 --> 42:34.427
<i>- What are they doing there?
- They're American.</i>

42:35.262 --> 42:37.389
<i>- Yeah, and I'm Japanese.</i>

42:37.514 --> 42:41.518
<i>On Saturdays, I put on my flip-flops
and make sushi at the mall.</i>

42:41.643 --> 42:43.436
- She's right. They are Americans.

42:43.562 --> 42:44.813
Show him.

42:50.443 --> 42:52.487
<i>- They're all at the same university.</i>

42:52.988 --> 42:55.240
<i>- What system did you hack into?
- None.</i>

42:55.365 --> 42:57.033
<i>They're all properly enrolled.</i>

42:57.158 --> 42:59.327
<i>They're even listed in our official database</i>

42:59.452 --> 43:01.997
<i>as humanitarian observers and consultants.</i>

43:02.581 --> 43:05.959
<i>- For who? Crooks Without Borders?
- That's not a real thing.</i>

43:07.627 --> 43:09.004
<i>- Thanks, Princess Leia.</i>

43:10.755 --> 43:12.549
- What if they're FBI?

43:12.674 --> 43:14.134
<i>- Fuck, this is heavy!</i>

43:14.259 --> 43:15.969
- They're rocks!

43:17.053 --> 43:18.263
- FBI?

43:18.388 --> 43:19.889
- Mm-hmm!

43:20.015 --> 43:22.183
- Nah! No, no, no.

43:22.309 --> 43:23.685
<i>What next?</i>

43:23.810 --> 43:28.356
<i>Are the KGB and Scotland Yard on their way
for middle management like DiPietro?</i>

43:29.190 --> 43:33.403
- OK, you take care of DiPietro,
and I'll keep my eyes on the Americans.

43:33.820 --> 43:36.698
<i>- Great. Keep me posted.</i>
- Hey!

43:36.823 --> 43:38.992
Aren't you forgetting something?

43:39.117 --> 43:40.201
- Uh, no.

43:40.327 --> 43:41.828
- Uh, the tip?

43:41.953 --> 43:43.330
<i>- What tip?</i>

43:43.455 --> 43:47.083
- Yesterday, the guy whose car you stole,
he gave you a tip.

43:47.208 --> 43:48.376
$20, right?

43:49.044 --> 43:50.045
<i>- Yeah, and?</i>

43:50.170 --> 43:54.090
- Well, I tipped the valet, too,
and I'd like to get my money back.

43:55.216 --> 43:56.801
- Man!

43:56.926 --> 43:59.137
You're so cheap!

43:59.262 --> 44:01.556
(Both chuckling)

44:03.183 --> 44:05.352
<i>How much did you tip him?</i>
- $10 bucks!

44:08.146 --> 44:09.773
<i>- I want my change.</i>

44:09.898 --> 44:12.400
- And you're calling me cheap.

44:18.156 --> 44:20.909
<i>- You're $5 short.
- No!</i>

44:22.160 --> 44:24.245
I paid $10, you got $20,

44:24.371 --> 44:27.207
the profit is $10, so your share is $5.

44:29.417 --> 44:31.294
<i>- Tabarnak!</i>

44:31.419 --> 44:35.215
You need help. You need therapy, my friend.

44:35.340 --> 44:36.424
Hey!

44:36.549 --> 44:40.303
<i>You should be in AA. Or maybe in CC...</i>
"Cheap Canadians."

44:40.428 --> 44:44.015
"Hi, my name is Martin!"
"Hi, Martin!"

44:44.140 --> 44:46.351
"I've been a cheap Canadian since I was born,

44:46.476 --> 44:50.105
"and I'm so excited to get 5 bucks,
I'm still shaking."

44:55.068 --> 44:59.280
<i>- Here! Swap this out!</i>
- Whoa! <i>You seem to think I work for you.</i>

44:59.406 --> 45:01.116
- Ah!

45:01.241 --> 45:03.910
<i>I'm sorry. Didn't I explain this to you?</i>

45:04.994 --> 45:06.538
<i>Federal...</i>

45:11.042 --> 45:11.960
<i>provincial.</i>

45:12.794 --> 45:16.965
<i>- That's not the best way to talk
to a separatist with anger issues!</i>

45:17.090 --> 45:19.175
<i>- Watch your mouth, young man!</i>

45:19.300 --> 45:22.971
<i>This morning, my endocrinologist
told me I wasn't the right sex!</i>

45:23.096 --> 45:25.557
<i>My testosterone level is abnormally high:</i>

45:25.682 --> 45:28.226
<i>women are at 2, men are at 7,</i>

45:28.351 --> 45:30.228
<i>and I'm a fucking 9.2!</i>

45:36.818 --> 45:38.778
(Door slamming)

45:41.531 --> 45:44.409
<i>- At least she's seeing a professional.</i>

45:47.245 --> 45:48.997
(Car honking)

45:54.377 --> 45:57.964
- Martin Ward, RCMP.
I need to see an official.

45:58.089 --> 46:02.093
It's regarding
a very important and delicate matter.

46:02.218 --> 46:04.512
- Everything is important, sir.

46:04.637 --> 46:07.056
Take a blue number.
Take a seat right there.

46:07.182 --> 46:09.267
Somebody will be with you shortly.

46:12.520 --> 46:13.813
<i>- Have a nice day!</i>

46:14.939 --> 46:16.941
<i>Hello! Can I take your order?</i>

46:17.066 --> 46:19.235
<i>- Yes, I'd like the surf and turf,</i>

46:19.360 --> 46:21.738
<i>a baked potato with foie gras</i>

46:21.863 --> 46:23.948
<i>and a glass of red wine, please.</i>

46:24.073 --> 46:26.743
<i>- Dad! OK, anything else?</i>

46:28.912 --> 46:30.872
<i>- I needed to see your face.</i>

46:32.791 --> 46:35.752
<i>Are you ready for your exam?
- Yes, I'm ready.</i>

46:35.877 --> 46:37.587
<i>Nervous, but ready.</i>

46:37.712 --> 46:40.924
<i>- Let's go over the steps involved
in a civilian intervention.</i>

46:41.049 --> 46:43.218
<i>- Dad, I'm ready!
- Tut, tut, tut!</i>

46:43.343 --> 46:44.427
<i>Envoie!</i>

46:45.887 --> 46:48.723
<i>- Approach, identification, questioning, listening,</i>

46:48.848 --> 46:51.100
<i>situation analysis, conflict resolution.</i>

46:51.226 --> 46:53.353
<i>- And if you can't resolve the conflict?</i>

46:53.478 --> 46:56.105
<i>- I'll do what you'd do:
make up a law or pull my gun.</i>

46:56.231 --> 46:57.482
<i>- Ha ha ha!</i>

46:57.607 --> 46:59.526
<i>Very funny!</i>

46:59.651 --> 47:01.402
(Laughing)
<i>- I'm ready, Dad.</i>

47:01.528 --> 47:04.614
<i>- I know you are. If I passed it,
then you'll ace it.</i>

47:05.865 --> 47:07.033
<i>- Thanks.</i>

47:07.158 --> 47:09.786
(Car honking)
- Hey!

47:10.161 --> 47:12.997
<i>Let's go, moron!
- Calm down!</i>

47:13.122 --> 47:16.459
<i>There are 40 different donuts!
I need a minute to choose!</i>

47:16.584 --> 47:18.169
<i>- Dad!
- I don't have all day!</i>

47:18.294 --> 47:20.088
(Speaking gibberish)

47:20.213 --> 47:22.549
<i>- Drive up to the first window, please.</i>

<i>Honey-lavender.

<i>- I can't believe that even exists.
They need a bacon and ribs flavour.</i>

(Gabrielle laughing)

48:27.071 --> 48:28.615
OK?

48:28.740 --> 48:30.700
- OK.

48:31.743 --> 48:32.869
<i>Here.</i>

48:39.918 --> 48:40.793
<i>- Smile!</i>

(Both laughing)

48:56.601 --> 48:57.894
- What?

49:04.525 --> 49:06.527
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

49:09.656 --> 49:12.492
- We're serving number 159, sir.

49:12.617 --> 49:14.452
- Perhaps you've made a mistake

49:14.577 --> 49:17.163
and slipped by a couple too quickly?

49:17.288 --> 49:19.415
- Impossible. It's all done by computer.

49:19.540 --> 49:21.501
The numbers are not switched manually.

49:21.626 --> 49:24.712
- I need to speak to somebody now!

49:24.837 --> 49:25.838
- Ken!

49:30.885 --> 49:32.178
We have a Code 63.

49:32.303 --> 49:34.555
- Code 63? What the heck is that?

49:34.681 --> 49:37.266
- Please... Thanks, Clo. Take your 15.

49:37.392 --> 49:39.310
I got this.

49:39.435 --> 49:41.521
(Sighing)

49:41.646 --> 49:45.566
- Look, I'm sorry--
- The paper we gave you on your way in.

49:48.319 --> 49:51.406
- The reason for my impatience...

49:51.531 --> 49:53.324
In fact, the entire visit here--

49:57.120 --> 49:59.080
(Keyboard clicking)

50:01.833 --> 50:03.876
- I'm sorry, sir. No one can see you today.

50:04.002 --> 50:07.839
But if you want to come back tomorrow,
I'm sure I can get you on another list.

50:07.964 --> 50:08.923

50:12.719 --> 50:15.138
<i>- You're beautiful.

50:16.222 --> 50:18.349
<i>But I don't miss your biker look.</i>

50:25.398 --> 50:26.774
<i>- How'd you do that?</i>

50:27.316 --> 50:29.736
<i>- I have an in with your tenant.</i>

50:31.070 --> 50:34.115
<i>- I knew I was right to remarry you!</i>

50:34.240 --> 50:35.491
<i>You're the perfect man:</i>

50:35.616 --> 50:39.912
<i>you're never here, so you feel bad

50:46.294 --> 50:47.795
<i>You OK?</i>

50:48.671 --> 50:51.799

50:52.550 --> 50:54.260
<i>- I know, my love.</i>

50:54.385 --> 50:57.722
<i>But it's almost over.
- It's never over.</i>

51:00.183 --> 51:02.185
<i>Sometimes I wonder why I do all this,</i>

51:02.310 --> 51:04.145
<i>just to catch a couple crooks.</i>

51:04.937 --> 51:06.856
<i>Then the trial will take years,</i>

51:06.981 --> 51:10.276
<i>and if any evidence gets thrown out,
the whole thing goes down the drain!</i>

51:10.401 --> 51:12.320
<i>- Can you put my husband on?</i>

51:12.445 --> 51:14.822
<i>My man never talks this way.</i>

51:14.947 --> 51:18.659
<i>Do you know him?
- No. What's he like?</i>

51:18.785 --> 51:21.954
<i>- He's a stubborn bastard with a bad temper,</i>

51:22.080 --> 51:26.959
<i>but he's the bravest, most honest,
most determined man there is.</i>

51:28.586 --> 51:29.921
<i>- Go on.</i>

51:30.046 --> 51:32.006
<i>- He's an alpha male.</i>

51:32.131 --> 51:34.133
<i>He doesn't quit until he wins.</i>

51:34.801 --> 51:38.179
<i>I should know. He won me over twice!</i>

51:38.304 --> 51:40.139
<i>- I don't deserve you!</i>

51:43.392 --> 51:44.477
<i>- I know.</i>

52:18.719 --> 52:21.180
<i>Are you there?
- Yes, I'm here, my love.</i>

52:21.305 --> 52:23.224
<i>Sorry, it was work.</i>

52:26.853 --> 52:29.522
<i>That's a lie. I'm not at a motel.</i>

52:29.647 --> 52:32.525
<i>- I know! You wouldn't be
a good undercover cop with me.</i>

52:33.359 --> 52:36.612
<i>OK, I'll let you go.
I want to enjoy my ice cream.</i>

52:37.488 --> 52:38.906
OK?

53:53.606 --> 53:55.149

53:55.274 --> 53:58.194
- Fine. Great, actually.

54:10.414 --> 54:12.541
Wait, did you track me down?

54:12.667 --> 54:14.543
- No!

54:15.586 --> 54:17.088
That doesn't matter.

54:17.213 --> 54:19.924
Son... we need to talk.

54:21.133 --> 54:23.010
- What could there possibly be to talk about?

54:24.011 --> 54:25.805
- Jonathan...

01:06:42.624 --> 01:06:44.292
(Gagging)

01:06:45.877 --> 01:06:47.838
- So, this is the first batch of cars.

01:06:47.963 --> 01:06:49.673
They leave for the coast tonight.

01:06:49.798 --> 01:06:53.927
- The 2nd wave heads out tomorrow.
- The rest will be on the road come D-Day.

01:06:54.052 --> 01:06:57.723
- And you can trust all these drivers?
- Absolutely! See, no one knows the endgame.

01:06:57.848 --> 01:07:00.767
As far as they know,
it's just another routine run.

01:07:01.935 --> 01:07:05.230
- We have secret drop spots
where the mechanics leave the vehicles.

01:07:05.355 --> 01:07:06.982
The drivers pick it up from there.

01:07:07.107 --> 01:07:09.651
- It's kind of like Bixi, but a little different.

01:07:11.695 --> 01:07:13.196
- Good work!

01:07:16.450 --> 01:07:18.618
Nobody pays to see the rehearsals!

01:07:18.744 --> 01:07:20.662
(Engine starting)

01:07:25.417 --> 01:07:27.627
- In 36 hours, we'll be rich.

01:07:29.212 --> 01:07:30.464
- Or dead.

01:07:42.851 --> 01:07:46.354
- Well, FBI's on the way.

01:07:47.481 --> 01:07:48.857
- Good call.

01:07:48.982 --> 01:07:49.900
- Yeah.

01:07:50.025 --> 01:07:51.443
- Yeah.

01:07:52.903 --> 01:07:55.322
(Crickets chirping)

01:07:56.823 --> 01:08:00.619
- Well, I guess I'd best go have a chat with him.

01:08:00.744 --> 01:08:04.331
- Don't do this, sir. I mean, he's a terrorist.

01:08:04.456 --> 01:08:07.626
- He's right. The FBI is on the way, sir.

01:08:07.751 --> 01:08:09.961
- Captain, your wife and the boys...

01:08:10.087 --> 01:08:12.506
Think about them. This isn't worth it!

01:08:12.631 --> 01:08:15.008
- Well, now, correct me if I'm wrong,

01:08:15.133 --> 01:08:16.384
but this is our town.

01:08:16.510 --> 01:08:19.763
Until somebody comes along
and tells me otherwise,

01:08:19.888 --> 01:08:21.640
we are still in charge here.

01:08:21.765 --> 01:08:23.225
I'm going in.

01:08:35.694 --> 01:08:36.988
(Sighing)

01:08:37.113 --> 01:08:38.365
Well!

01:08:39.741 --> 01:08:41.493
Who are you, son? Hmm?

01:08:41.618 --> 01:08:45.162
Who you, uh...
Who you working for?

01:08:45.287 --> 01:08:48.625
- Wow! Don't beat around the bush, sir!

01:08:48.750 --> 01:08:53.171
(Female officer): Mmm... Maybe a bit too aggressive.
You don't wanna put him on the defensive.

01:08:53.296 --> 01:08:56.091
- He's a terrorist.
I think he starts on the defensive.

01:08:56.216 --> 01:08:58.093
- My name is David Bouchard.

01:08:58.218 --> 01:09:00.178
I'm a French-Canadian cop

01:09:00.303 --> 01:09:03.265
working undercover for the Sûreté du Québec.

01:09:04.057 --> 01:09:05.725
- For who?

01:09:05.850 --> 01:09:09.437
(Anglophone accent):
The Sûreté du Québec.

01:09:09.563 --> 01:09:11.773
- He's totally making that up.

01:09:11.898 --> 01:09:12.774
- Mm-hmm.

01:09:12.899 --> 01:09:15.193
- Are you a German?

01:09:15.318 --> 01:09:16.611
- What?

01:09:18.988 --> 01:09:21.700
No. No! I'm French.

01:09:21.825 --> 01:09:23.410
- French?

01:09:24.786 --> 01:09:27.913
Well, now, I thought you said you was Canadian!

01:09:28.038 --> 01:09:30.667
- Oh!
- He's got him!

01:09:30.792 --> 01:09:32.961
- Really?
- Sure.

01:09:33.086 --> 01:09:36.298
First he says he's French, and then Canadian?

01:09:36.423 --> 01:09:40.051
- Uh, pretty sure there are French Canadians.

01:09:40.176 --> 01:09:41.261
(Both men chuckling)

01:09:41.386 --> 01:09:43.555
- French... French Can...?

01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:46.600
- Which is it, son? You French or Canadian?

01:09:46.725 --> 01:09:48.225
- I'm Quebecois, <i>calice!</i>

01:09:48.350 --> 01:09:51.563
French-Canadian, <i>séparatiste libérale, tabernak!</i>

01:09:51.688 --> 01:09:52.814
<i>Where are you from?</i>

01:09:52.939 --> 01:09:55.317
<i>United Stupids of America?
Or South Moronia?</i>

01:09:55.442 --> 01:09:56.443
<i>You fucking dumbass!</i>

01:09:56.568 --> 01:09:57.944
- OK, that was not French.

01:09:58.069 --> 01:10:00.238
- Yeah, it sounded more like Swedish.

01:10:00.363 --> 01:10:04.201
- Yeah! Like the Swedish Chef on <i>The Muppets.</i>

01:10:05.285 --> 01:10:07.204
- Hmm?

01:10:07.329 --> 01:10:08.413
- The...

01:10:08.538 --> 01:10:10.707
(Speaking Swedish-sounding gibberish)

01:10:10.832 --> 01:10:11.750
- Ah.

01:10:11.875 --> 01:10:13.210
- No, that was French.

01:10:13.335 --> 01:10:16.171
Like, it might be some kind of, like, street,

01:10:16.296 --> 01:10:19.090
weird, 2nd-rate, bastardized kind of French,

01:10:19.216 --> 01:10:20.508
but that was French.

01:10:20.634 --> 01:10:23.511
- I'm pretty sure it was Swedish.
- Mm.

01:10:23.637 --> 01:10:26.723
- You best get your story straight there, son!

01:10:26.848 --> 01:10:29.267
The FBI is on the way.

01:10:29.392 --> 01:10:31.228
- The FBI?
- Mm-hmm.

01:10:31.853 --> 01:10:34.606
And they won't be nearly as kind as we are!

01:10:37.317 --> 01:10:39.110
- Whew! FBI's coming here?

01:10:39.236 --> 01:10:40.654
- Mm.

01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:45.867
- Hallelujah! Praise the Lord!

01:10:46.576 --> 01:10:48.161
I'll wait for them, then.

01:10:48.286 --> 01:10:50.330
Thanks for your participation.

01:10:50.455 --> 01:10:51.623
Very appreciated.

01:10:54.668 --> 01:10:56.962
- Uh, you sure about that?

01:10:57.087 --> 01:10:59.005
<i>- Yep! Damn sure!</i>

01:10:59.130 --> 01:11:01.675
(Speaking Swedish-sounding gibberish)

01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:05.262
- You're sure?
Because if you... wanted to straighten anything up...

01:11:06.471 --> 01:11:09.724
more than happy to have a little chinwag...
(Chuckling)

01:11:09.849 --> 01:11:11.559
<i>...mano a mano.</i>

01:11:17.357 --> 01:11:20.610
(♪ Whistling <i>Auld Lang Syne</i> ♪)

01:11:30.287 --> 01:11:32.414
Well!
(Clearing throat)

01:11:32.539 --> 01:11:34.416
Can't say I didn't warn you!

01:11:45.635 --> 01:11:46.678
Well...

01:11:48.179 --> 01:11:50.932
I guess I stirred his giblets pretty good.

01:12:00.150 --> 01:12:01.359
(Sighing)

01:12:04.988 --> 01:12:06.865
(Sirens wailing)

01:12:12.203 --> 01:12:14.622
- All right. Let's make sure that bridge is safe.

01:12:14.748 --> 01:12:17.459
Let's take all the time that we need
to process this crime scene properly.

01:12:17.584 --> 01:12:19.544
I want Command and Central
up and running in ten.

01:12:19.669 --> 01:12:23.214
And get the mayor on the line
and tell him to meet me here in half an hour.

01:12:23.340 --> 01:12:26.718
- Yes, sir, excuse me, can I get...
- Sir, sir, sir! Just a few...

01:12:28.511 --> 01:12:30.889
- I'm gonna make a brief statement.

01:12:31.014 --> 01:12:34.225
- Sir, do we have information
on who committed this act of extreme violence?

01:12:34.351 --> 01:12:36.644
- Do you think that this attack
was terrorist-related?

01:12:36.770 --> 01:12:40.065
- The statement does not include questions.
However, I can say that this act

01:12:40.190 --> 01:12:43.109
was in no way related
to a terrorist organization.

01:12:43.234 --> 01:12:44.694
We do have a suspect in custody,

01:12:44.819 --> 01:12:47.447
and I will keep you posted
on any future developments.

01:12:47.572 --> 01:12:50.283
- Can you give us the name of the suspect?

01:12:50.408 --> 01:12:52.744
- I want the good people
of Middlebrook to know

01:12:52.869 --> 01:12:54.496
that they are safe tonight.

01:12:54.621 --> 01:12:56.998
Rest assured, there are no further threats.

01:12:57.123 --> 01:12:58.917
- Martin Ward, RCMP.
- Stay back.

01:12:59.042 --> 01:13:01.753
- I need to speak to whoever's in charge.

01:13:05.215 --> 01:13:06.800
- Agent Blaine, FBI.

01:13:06.925 --> 01:13:10.804
- I have information that'll be of great use to you.
- Oh, really?

01:13:17.394 --> 01:13:20.688
- David. Agent Blaine, FBI.

01:13:23.942 --> 01:13:27.487
- Is this man here your partner?
- Well, partner is a relative term.

01:13:27.612 --> 01:13:29.239
- Martin!
- Yes, he is.

01:13:29.364 --> 01:13:31.866
This is David Bouchard
from the Sûreté du Québec.

01:13:31.991 --> 01:13:33.201
He is one of my men.

01:13:33.326 --> 01:13:35.995
- Then, sir, I'm gonna
have to ask you to turn around

01:13:36.121 --> 01:13:38.373
and slowly put your hands on the table.

01:13:38.498 --> 01:13:39.958
- What?

01:13:40.083 --> 01:13:40.917
- Mm.

01:13:41.042 --> 01:13:42.168
- I'm RCMP!

01:13:42.293 --> 01:13:44.921
- Sir! I'm not gonna ask again.

01:13:57.183 --> 01:14:00.186
<i>- Did you really think they'd let me go</i>

01:14:00.311 --> 01:14:03.314
<i>because you flashed
your little Canadian police badge?</i>

01:14:03.982 --> 01:14:05.483
<i>You're so naïve!</i>

01:14:06.025 --> 01:14:09.154
<i>You haven't become
a Jehovah's Witness, have you?</i>

01:14:09.988 --> 01:14:12.490
<i>I was driving a car that exploded</i>

01:14:12.615 --> 01:14:15.827
<i>in the country with the most
terrorist threats in the world!</i>

01:14:15.952 --> 01:14:18.955
<i>Now, instead of just me
being stuck here, we both are!</i>

01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:20.915
<i>Good job!</i>

01:14:23.543 --> 01:14:26.713
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
my partner, Martin Ward!</i>

01:14:27.547 --> 01:14:28.756
RCMP!

01:14:28.882 --> 01:14:30.341
(Sighing)

01:14:38.266 --> 01:14:39.726
I'm sorry.

01:14:40.768 --> 01:14:42.270
- What for?

01:14:43.605 --> 01:14:46.191
<i>- You know. Don't rub it in.</i>

01:14:46.316 --> 01:14:49.360
- But there are just so many to choose from!

01:14:54.115 --> 01:14:55.575
- Fuck you.

01:14:55.700 --> 01:14:57.744
(Both chuckling)

01:14:58.703 --> 01:15:01.623
- Do you think the other 25 cars
are rigged like yours?

01:15:01.748 --> 01:15:03.249
<i>- Definitely!</i>

01:15:04.250 --> 01:15:07.712
<i>It's brilliant: you disseminate
stolen cars all over the States</i>

01:15:07.837 --> 01:15:09.589
<i>and simultaneously blow them up!</i>

01:15:09.714 --> 01:15:12.717
- Even if somebody knows that something's wrong,
who's gonna say anything?

01:15:12.842 --> 01:15:14.594
I mean, they bought a stolen car.

01:15:14.969 --> 01:15:16.888
<i>- What do we do if we get out?</i>

01:15:17.013 --> 01:15:20.350
- I'll get my team together.
We'll go back in, get those computers out.

01:15:20.975 --> 01:15:24.020
We need the FBI to believe us, or we're done.

01:15:33.029 --> 01:15:34.447
- Shaking again?

01:15:38.159 --> 01:15:42.539
<i>Is it that hard for you
to be alone in a room with me?</i>

01:15:43.081 --> 01:15:44.582
- You wish!

01:15:47.627 --> 01:15:48.920
<i>- What is it?</i>

01:15:51.005 --> 01:15:52.924
- I'm cold.

01:15:56.636 --> 01:15:58.137
<i>- What is it?</i>

01:15:58.721 --> 01:16:01.599
<i>This isn't the first time. What's going on?</i>

01:16:10.316 --> 01:16:11.818
(Sighing)

01:16:12.694 --> 01:16:14.195
<i>- I'm sick, David.</i>

01:16:15.321 --> 01:16:16.531
Very.

01:16:18.533 --> 01:16:19.951
- What is it?

01:16:23.079 --> 01:16:25.206
<i>- I have Lou Gehrig's disease.</i>

01:16:29.043 --> 01:16:30.503
- OK.

01:16:31.546 --> 01:16:33.298
<i>Who's Lou Gehrig?</i>

01:16:33.423 --> 01:16:37.635
<i>- He was a baseball player.
Had one of the first known cases.</i>

01:16:42.390 --> 01:16:43.891
<i>- I don't know baseball.</i>

01:16:45.393 --> 01:16:47.186
<i>Is it like Parkinson's?</i>

01:16:47.770 --> 01:16:49.314
- Well...

01:16:49.439 --> 01:16:51.774
<i>It's a degenerative disease.</i>

01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:56.613
I'm slowly losing control
of my motor functions.

01:16:56.738 --> 01:17:01.659
So... one by one,
things will shut down.

01:17:01.784 --> 01:17:03.244
And the fun part is,

01:17:03.369 --> 01:17:06.539
you never know what, when or in what order.

01:17:06.664 --> 01:17:10.585
Just that they're all gonna go. Eventually.

01:17:11.586 --> 01:17:14.881
<i>It's like Russian roulette.</i>

01:17:15.423 --> 01:17:18.593
Hey, Martin.
What are you gonna lose today?

01:17:18.718 --> 01:17:20.386
The ability to swallow...

01:17:22.472 --> 01:17:23.931
or speak?

01:17:28.019 --> 01:17:29.729
<i>- That could take years.</i>

01:17:29.854 --> 01:17:32.148
- Not many. Six, maybe seven.

01:17:32.273 --> 01:17:36.986
And the last few aren't that much fun, so I hear.

01:17:37.111 --> 01:17:38.071
(Sighing)

01:17:40.698 --> 01:17:42.742
<i>- There must be medication.</i>

01:17:42.867 --> 01:17:46.704
- Yeah. I'm taking them.
They slow it down, but...

01:17:55.380 --> 01:17:56.881
- I'm sorry, man.

01:17:58.174 --> 01:18:00.009
(Breathing deeply)

01:18:06.891 --> 01:18:08.351
<i>calice!</i>

01:18:16.484 --> 01:18:20.947
And you thought being stuck with me
was the worst thing that could happen to you?

01:18:21.072 --> 01:18:22.990
- Oh, it still is.

01:18:23.116 --> 01:18:25.243
(Both chuckling)

01:18:26.828 --> 01:18:28.287
I want...

01:18:32.625 --> 01:18:36.087
I need to win this one.

01:18:40.633 --> 01:18:42.427
I don't wanna step down...

01:18:43.928 --> 01:18:45.972
just a sick, old man.

01:18:47.390 --> 01:18:48.558
You know?

01:18:50.351 --> 01:18:51.519
- You won't.

01:19:01.654 --> 01:19:03.156
You won't.

01:19:16.335 --> 01:19:18.296
(Birds chirping)

01:19:27.472 --> 01:19:29.348
- Gentlemen!

01:19:29.474 --> 01:19:30.850
You're good to go.

01:19:30.975 --> 01:19:33.644
- Huh?
- Everything checked out.

01:19:35.062 --> 01:19:38.858
- There are about 25 more cars, we think,
rigged just like this one.

01:19:38.983 --> 01:19:42.320
- We don't know when the shit's gonna go down,
but we think it's gonna be pretty soon.

01:19:42.445 --> 01:19:44.322
- So what's our next move?
- I don't know.

01:19:44.447 --> 01:19:47.492
- You don't know what your next move is?
- Oh, <i>my</i> next move?

01:19:47.617 --> 01:19:49.744
My next move is to escort you to the border,

01:19:49.869 --> 01:19:52.622
shake your hands,
thank you kindly and wish you luck.

01:19:52.747 --> 01:19:56.334
And your next move
will be to file all the necessary paperwork

01:19:56.459 --> 01:19:59.504
that we're gonna need
to conclude this investigation.

01:19:59.629 --> 01:20:02.465
But your superiors
are gonna explain all of that to you,

01:20:02.590 --> 01:20:05.259
in both official languages, when you return.

01:20:05.384 --> 01:20:08.387
Oh, and gents, next time you feel like

01:20:08.513 --> 01:20:12.183
crashing into my backyard
and stirring up a shitstorm,

01:20:12.308 --> 01:20:14.185
do me a favour: call me first

01:20:14.310 --> 01:20:17.855
so I can tell you to stay
the fuck away from my country!

01:20:19.941 --> 01:20:21.442
<i>- What an asshole!</i>

01:20:23.569 --> 01:20:26.197
- He kind of reminds me of you when we met.

01:20:47.885 --> 01:20:49.720
- Where is everybody?

01:20:50.221 --> 01:20:54.559
<i>- The big boss pulled the plug, Boss.</i>
- Why are you still here, then?

01:20:54.684 --> 01:20:57.645
<i>- My boss is you, Boss. Not your boss.</i>
- What?

01:20:57.770 --> 01:20:59.021
<i>- Don't ask me.</i>

01:20:59.146 --> 01:21:01.899
<i>- There's no signal. I don't understand.</i>

01:21:02.024 --> 01:21:03.568
<i>What the fuck?</i>

01:21:03.693 --> 01:21:06.279
<i>- Are they still in the garage?
- No.</i>

01:21:06.404 --> 01:21:08.698
- Don't you have a tracker
on the device you had David switch?

01:21:08.823 --> 01:21:09.991
<i>- Yes, but there's no signal.</i>

01:21:10.116 --> 01:21:11.951
<i>- OK. The consulate.</i>

01:21:12.076 --> 01:21:15.872
- We can't touch them. They're on American soil.
Besides, we don't even know if they're still there.

01:21:17.373 --> 01:21:21.961
- Fucking fuck the fuck the fucking fuck!

01:21:23.379 --> 01:21:26.007
- Always one move behind.

01:21:30.303 --> 01:21:31.512
- OK.

01:21:38.686 --> 01:21:39.770
Jen!

01:21:39.896 --> 01:21:41.731
- Are you sure he's here?

01:21:41.856 --> 01:21:45.109
<i>- Yes, the bartender kept me in touch.
There is hardly anyone left.</i>

01:21:55.369 --> 01:21:58.331
<i>- We're closed! Don't you have a watch?</i>
- Oh! I'm sorry!

01:21:58.456 --> 01:22:00.333
My watch is still on Vancouver time,

01:22:00.458 --> 01:22:02.960
which means we've still got several hours left.

01:22:03.085 --> 01:22:05.129
So step right back inside.

01:22:05.254 --> 01:22:06.756
<i>- Salut!</i>

01:22:07.465 --> 01:22:08.716
<i>Remember me?</i>

01:22:12.178 --> 01:22:15.890
<i>I don't know this Lou Gehrig,
but he must've been a hell of a player!</i>

01:22:16.307 --> 01:22:18.392
<i>Sorry, too soon?</i>

01:22:20.478 --> 01:22:22.396
(Screaming)

01:22:23.856 --> 01:22:24.857
<i>- Fuck!</i>

01:22:25.441 --> 01:22:28.152
- Police! Everybody out!
We're looking for a Mike.

01:22:28.277 --> 01:22:29.904
(Groaning)

01:22:33.032 --> 01:22:34.992
<i>- OK, everybody out!</i> Mike!

01:22:37.119 --> 01:22:38.412
<i>Michel!</i>

01:22:40.206 --> 01:22:41.207
<i>Mikey!</i>

01:22:42.625 --> 01:22:45.086
<i>I know you're here, Mikey!</i>
(Jen whimpering)

01:22:45.211 --> 01:22:46.671
<i>- OK, easy! Easy there!</i>

01:22:48.839 --> 01:22:50.132
- Mike!

01:22:52.343 --> 01:22:56.681
<i>Don't make me shoot. Let her go.
She didn't know I was a cop!</i>

01:22:56.806 --> 01:22:58.391
- There's no way out.
The place is surrounded.

01:22:58.516 --> 01:23:02.520
<i>- Shut up! I'm getting out of here,
or I slit her throat. Got it?</i>

01:23:02.645 --> 01:23:03.854
- Mike!

01:23:03.980 --> 01:23:08.359
<i>Let her go, and we'll put
our guns down so we can talk.</i>

01:23:08.484 --> 01:23:11.278
<i>- What kind of idiot do you think I am?</i>
(Cops): Mike!

01:23:11.404 --> 01:23:12.613
<i>- Don't move!</i>

01:23:12.738 --> 01:23:15.074
- Nobody's died yet.
You can still get out of this.

01:23:15.199 --> 01:23:18.452
<i>- Shut up! I'll bleed her dry, goddammit!</i>

01:23:18.577 --> 01:23:20.496
- Mike! Mike! Mike! Mike! Mike!

01:23:20.621 --> 01:23:21.914
<i>Calm down! Look!</i>

01:23:23.541 --> 01:23:25.459
<i>I'm putting down my gun.</i>

01:23:25.584 --> 01:23:26.877
- David! Don't!

01:23:27.003 --> 01:23:28.546
<i>- Let him go. He'll kill her.</i>

01:23:28.671 --> 01:23:29.964
- No! No!

01:23:30.089 --> 01:23:32.299
<i>- Put your gun down!
- Drop it!</i>

01:23:32.425 --> 01:23:34.218
- Martin!
<i>- Tell him to drop it!</i>

01:23:34.343 --> 01:23:35.302
- No!

01:23:36.345 --> 01:23:38.472
You listen to me.

01:23:38.597 --> 01:23:41.600
If you hurt that girl, I will shoot you,

01:23:41.726 --> 01:23:44.020
you intolerable piece of shit!

01:23:44.729 --> 01:23:46.522
(Yelping)

01:23:46.647 --> 01:23:49.984
(Screaming)

01:23:50.109 --> 01:23:51.777
(Roaring)

01:23:58.034 --> 01:23:59.910
<i>- You fucking psychopath!</i>

01:24:03.914 --> 01:24:06.417
<i>Abusive motherfucking pimp!</i>

01:24:11.380 --> 01:24:14.258
<i>You won't be grabbing anyone's ass anymore!</i>

01:24:18.137 --> 01:24:19.722
- OK, OK, OK!

01:24:20.931 --> 01:24:22.308
(Panting)

01:24:24.477 --> 01:24:26.854
<i>OK, two more?
What do you think, Martin?</i>

01:24:26.979 --> 01:24:30.066
- Yeah, two's right.
But not too hard, we need to talk to him.

01:24:30.983 --> 01:24:32.651
(Grunting)

01:24:33.778 --> 01:24:36.113
<i>- OK, it's over.</i>

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:49.752
- We have to go.

01:24:49.877 --> 01:24:51.378
- That fucking bitch!

01:24:54.757 --> 01:24:56.258
<i>- Are you all right?</i>

01:24:57.593 --> 01:24:59.011
- Mm-hmm.

01:24:59.136 --> 01:25:01.305
<i>- As soon as we're gone, call 911.</i>

01:25:02.890 --> 01:25:07.269
<i>- Aren't you the police?
- Yes, but no.</i>

01:25:08.020 --> 01:25:12.108
<i>You understand?
- No, but yes.</i>

01:25:12.525 --> 01:25:15.027
<i>- As soon as we leave, call 911.</i>

01:25:15.152 --> 01:25:18.072
<i>Tell them someone's been seriously injured.
Then get out.</i>

01:25:18.197 --> 01:25:20.699
<i>Make sure you're gone before they get here.</i>

01:25:20.825 --> 01:25:22.159
<i>You have a boyfriend?</i>

01:25:22.535 --> 01:25:26.247
<i>Good. Go to his place
and stay there until I call you.</i>

01:25:26.372 --> 01:25:30.334
<i>I'll call you when this is all over.
Then you can teach me some of those moves.</i>

01:25:31.877 --> 01:25:33.129
OK?

01:25:34.797 --> 01:25:36.298
<i>Thanks, Jen.</i>

01:25:43.305 --> 01:25:44.515
(Mike grunting)

01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:46.058
<i>- You can't do this, motherfuckers!</i>

01:25:49.979 --> 01:25:51.355
- Wow! That was quick!

01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:53.691
- I learned from the best.

01:25:57.528 --> 01:25:58.988
Shit!

01:25:59.321 --> 01:26:01.532
<i>- What?</i>
- My son! He tried to call me!

01:26:01.657 --> 01:26:04.743
<i>- Cool, that's a good sign!
I knew you'd work it out!</i>

01:26:05.327 --> 01:26:08.622
<i>- You assholes--</i>
(Mike grunting, dog barking)

01:26:10.166 --> 01:26:14.044
- So, tell us everything you know right now,

01:26:14.170 --> 01:26:16.672
and we might be willing to deal.

01:26:17.298 --> 01:26:21.135
<i>- You can shove your deals up your ass!</i>

01:26:21.260 --> 01:26:22.469
(Chuckling)

01:26:24.096 --> 01:26:25.639
<i>- I know you, Mike.</i>

01:26:26.765 --> 01:26:29.393
<i>You're a liar, a thief and a cheat.</i>

01:26:29.518 --> 01:26:31.061
<i>All about cash and chicks.</i>

01:26:32.563 --> 01:26:33.647
<i>But you're no killer.</i>

01:26:33.772 --> 01:26:36.233
- Money has that effect on certain people.

01:26:36.358 --> 01:26:38.527
<i>- You think I'm scared of the police?</i>

01:26:38.903 --> 01:26:41.614
<i>You gonna hit me with a phonebook
if I don't talk?</i>

01:26:45.451 --> 01:26:46.911
- Hey.

01:26:47.995 --> 01:26:52.666
<i>Look around, you moron.
Does this look like a police station?</i>

01:26:53.167 --> 01:26:55.461
<i>You think we brought you here to finger paint</i>

01:26:55.586 --> 01:26:58.130
<i>and take pictures of your ugly face?</i>

01:27:00.424 --> 01:27:01.926
<i>I'll rearrange your face!</i>

01:27:03.594 --> 01:27:05.095
Shit! Fuck!

01:27:05.221 --> 01:27:07.056
<i>My wife!</i>

01:27:07.556 --> 01:27:09.808
- What?
<i>- It's my wife!</i>

01:27:09.934 --> 01:27:11.268
(Grunting)

01:27:11.936 --> 01:27:13.437
<i>Hide him! Hide him!</i>

01:27:19.443 --> 01:27:22.029
<i>- David?
- Hello!</i>

01:27:22.738 --> 01:27:24.448
<i>Did I wake you?</i>

01:27:24.573 --> 01:27:26.033
(Sighing)

01:27:26.158 --> 01:27:27.660
<i>- It doesn't matter.</i>

01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:30.204
<i>What are you doing?</i>
(Muttering)

01:27:31.455 --> 01:27:32.456
<i>- Working.</i>

01:27:33.832 --> 01:27:35.167
(Clearing throat)

01:27:35.292 --> 01:27:37.920
<i>- You have blood on your hand.</i>
- Huh?

01:27:39.922 --> 01:27:41.882
<i>Oh, yeah! Would you look at that!</i>

01:27:43.425 --> 01:27:44.468
(Grunting)

01:27:47.471 --> 01:27:50.015
<i>- Is someone with you?
- No.</i>

01:27:51.016 --> 01:27:52.643
<i>Oh, him? That's just Martin.</i>

01:27:53.227 --> 01:27:55.062
<i>- Martin! Well, I--</i>

01:27:56.105 --> 01:27:58.482
<i>- My love, you can't go in the garage.</i>

01:27:59.858 --> 01:28:03.904
<i>- You'd better not be putting us
in danger with your bullshit.</i>

01:28:04.822 --> 01:28:05.990
<i>- No way!</i>

01:28:07.157 --> 01:28:08.867
<i>Trust me!</i>

01:28:08.993 --> 01:28:10.077
(Sighing)

01:28:11.704 --> 01:28:13.622
<i>- We'll talk about this later.</i>

01:28:13.747 --> 01:28:14.915
- OK.

01:28:15.249 --> 01:28:17.668
<i>Thank you, my love! I love you!</i>

01:28:29.930 --> 01:28:32.099
<i>I'm in big trouble.</i>

01:28:32.224 --> 01:28:34.518
- She's crazy about you.

01:28:34.643 --> 01:28:35.853
Lucky prick!

01:28:37.313 --> 01:28:38.314
(Mike): Aaah!

01:28:38.439 --> 01:28:40.190
- Oh, shit!

01:28:48.449 --> 01:28:49.908
(Wheezing)

01:28:54.246 --> 01:28:56.081
<i>- Come on, Michel!</i>

01:28:57.624 --> 01:28:59.209
(Breathing heavily)

01:28:59.335 --> 01:29:02.212
<i>Don't swallow this! It's bad for your health!</i>
(Coughing)

01:29:02.338 --> 01:29:06.258
<i>- I know where you live!
I'll slit your wife's throat!</i>

01:29:06.592 --> 01:29:08.427
- What did you say?

01:29:08.552 --> 01:29:11.638
Listen! You tell me what I need
to know right now, or I'll--

01:29:11.764 --> 01:29:15.559
- Or what? <i>You think I'm scared
of a few punches in the face?</i>

01:29:18.062 --> 01:29:22.441
- Listen to me,
you worthless speck of dog shit!

01:29:22.566 --> 01:29:24.777
My wife is gone, my son won't talk to me,

01:29:24.902 --> 01:29:25.861
and I'm dying.

01:29:25.986 --> 01:29:28.030
So if you think I give a flying fuck

01:29:28.155 --> 01:29:30.407
whether you die tonight, think again!

01:29:30.532 --> 01:29:34.661
You know when they say this guy did this crazy thing
because he had nothing to lose?

01:29:34.787 --> 01:29:36.705
Well, I'm that fucking guy! OK?

01:29:36.830 --> 01:29:38.248
(Whimpering)

01:29:42.711 --> 01:29:45.672
You tell me where this thing
is going down right now,

01:29:45.798 --> 01:29:48.801
or I will drill so many holes
in your hideous face

01:29:48.926 --> 01:29:50.219
that when the sun rises

01:29:50.344 --> 01:29:52.930
and the beams shine through
your ugly fucking skull,

01:29:53.055 --> 01:29:55.432
you will light up
like a goddamn disco ball!

01:29:55.557 --> 01:29:58.560
<i>- OK, OK, OK! But it's too late!</i>

01:29:58.685 --> 01:30:00.270
<i>There are already 20 cars across the border.</i>

01:30:00.396 --> 01:30:02.815
<i>The last batch leaves this morning.</i>

01:30:02.940 --> 01:30:05.692
<i>They're all rigged to explode on the same day!</i>

01:30:05.818 --> 01:30:08.362
<i>They're mobile bombs! That's it!</i>

01:30:08.487 --> 01:30:09.863
<i>- Who's delivering the cars?</i>

01:30:10.781 --> 01:30:13.659
<i>- A bunch of greedy kids. But they won't be back.</i>

01:30:13.784 --> 01:30:18.205
<i>They don't know the cars are rigged.
They're going to explode with them.</i>

01:30:18.330 --> 01:30:20.290
<i>There's no connection between them.</i>

01:30:20.416 --> 01:30:23.710
<i>By the time the FBI figures it out,
everyone will be gone.</i>

01:30:23.836 --> 01:30:25.170
- Where are the computers?

01:30:25.295 --> 01:30:27.965
<i>- I don't know. I swear I don't know!</i>

01:30:28.090 --> 01:30:30.676
<i>All we did was get the cars
and handle delivery.</i>

01:30:30.801 --> 01:30:33.470
<i>I don't even know
when they're set to go off!</i>

01:30:34.179 --> 01:30:38.392
<i>All I know is the last batch
is leaving this morning at 5:00!</i>

01:30:38.517 --> 01:30:40.644
<i>- From where?</i>
- Huh?

01:30:40.769 --> 01:30:45.732
<i>- From where?
- A vacant lot in the east end!</i>

01:30:45.858 --> 01:30:48.485
<i>That's all I know, I swear!</i>

01:30:48.610 --> 01:30:50.154
(Sobbing)

01:30:59.288 --> 01:31:00.956
(Breathing heavily)

01:31:04.084 --> 01:31:06.712
- Did I make him talk or what?

01:31:07.880 --> 01:31:12.885
<i>- Impressive. Especially using
a drill with no battery.</i>

01:31:17.598 --> 01:31:19.433
(Both chuckling)

01:31:22.561 --> 01:31:24.396
- Michel!

01:31:24.521 --> 01:31:26.356
There's no fucking battery!

01:31:26.482 --> 01:31:29.568
<i>- Don't call me Michel!</i>

01:31:33.572 --> 01:31:35.032
(Gun cocking)

01:31:38.285 --> 01:31:39.828
<i>- You sure you're OK with this?</i>

01:31:39.953 --> 01:31:42.164
- No choice. No time to go for more help.

01:31:42.289 --> 01:31:44.374
<i>- It might not go that far.</i>

01:31:58.180 --> 01:32:01.308
<i>If plan A doesn't work,
we go right to plan B. Got it?</i>

01:32:01.433 --> 01:32:03.602
<i>- Sounds to me like you have two plan Cs!</i>

01:32:03.727 --> 01:32:08.065
<i>- Well, well! The strip-club owner
is suddenly a mastermind!</i>

01:32:09.608 --> 01:32:11.443
<i>Get over your fear of harmless tools</i>

01:32:11.568 --> 01:32:14.947
<i>and then apply for a job with the RCMP or the SQ!</i>

01:32:16.073 --> 01:32:18.116
<i>Handcuffs?</i>

01:32:21.870 --> 01:32:23.497
<i>But if you're shaking like that...</i>

01:32:23.622 --> 01:32:25.499
- I'll be fine. Don't worry.

01:32:25.624 --> 01:32:29.002
- You have your meds?
Now would be a good time to take them.

01:32:29.127 --> 01:32:31.296
And if you have any extras...

01:32:33.590 --> 01:32:36.134
- Give me 90 seconds. I'll be in place.

01:32:37.010 --> 01:32:40.806
<i>- Well, Michel, our lives are connected.</i>

01:32:41.974 --> 01:32:43.934
<i>If something happens, we're both dead.</i>

01:32:44.518 --> 01:32:46.353
<i>- You guys are fucking nuts.</i>

01:32:47.271 --> 01:32:51.149
<i>- That's the nicest thing
you've ever said to me. Thank you.</i>

01:32:51.900 --> 01:32:53.902
<i>Let's go.</i>

01:33:17.426 --> 01:33:19.177
<i>Martin, are you ready?</i>

01:33:20.470 --> 01:33:22.556
(Men talking, indistinct)

01:33:33.400 --> 01:33:35.777
(Over earpiece): <i>I'm coming in. 2 o'clock.</i>

01:33:39.656 --> 01:33:40.699
Hey!

01:33:43.660 --> 01:33:45.996
<i>I found your poodle. Is there a reward?</i>

01:33:48.373 --> 01:33:49.833
- Get in your fucking cars! Go!

01:33:49.958 --> 01:33:52.210
- Shit! David, are you hit?

01:33:52.336 --> 01:33:54.004
<i>- What a shitty plan!</i>

01:33:54.129 --> 01:33:55.255
<i>The cars can't go.</i>

01:33:57.883 --> 01:33:58.967
(Screaming)

01:34:01.386 --> 01:34:02.721
(Grunting)

01:34:26.662 --> 01:34:28.705
- Aaah!

01:34:32.250 --> 01:34:35.295
- Jonathan! Jonathan!

01:34:39.758 --> 01:34:41.301
- Drop the fucking gun!

01:34:41.426 --> 01:34:43.887
(Screaming)

01:34:44.012 --> 01:34:45.430
(Tires screeching)

01:34:45.555 --> 01:34:46.556
Martin!

01:34:46.682 --> 01:34:50.435
<i>- Hey, you've reached Jonathan.
You know what to do after the beep.</i>

01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:52.938
(Whispering): Come on!

01:34:55.524 --> 01:34:58.068
- Martin! Martin!

01:34:58.485 --> 01:35:00.070
<i>Martin, I've got DiPietro!</i>

01:35:01.029 --> 01:35:04.908
<i>Martin, where are you? Can you hear me?</i>

01:35:06.952 --> 01:35:07.953
(Groaning)

01:35:08.078 --> 01:35:09.830
<i>I need help with the kids!</i>

01:35:09.955 --> 01:35:11.373
(Moaning)

01:35:11.707 --> 01:35:14.459
<i>This will hurt, but you need
to put direct pressure on it.</i>

01:35:14.584 --> 01:35:16.044
(Beeping)
<i>- Ostie de c--</i>

01:35:17.254 --> 01:35:18.213
- Fuck!

01:35:20.340 --> 01:35:23.760
<i>Martin, they can see us! It's going to blow!</i>

01:35:26.722 --> 01:35:28.306
Calice!

01:35:28.432 --> 01:35:30.267
- Shut up! Shut up!

01:35:53.915 --> 01:35:55.125
(Metal creaking)

01:35:57.753 --> 01:35:59.463
<i>- TABARNAK!</i>

01:36:24.988 --> 01:36:26.490
<i>What the fuck?</i>

01:36:27.783 --> 01:36:29.201
(Laughing)

01:36:35.749 --> 01:36:36.875
Martin!

01:36:38.001 --> 01:36:39.419
Martin!

01:36:39.544 --> 01:36:41.922
- My son is one of the drivers.

01:36:43.173 --> 01:36:44.174
<i>- What?</i>

01:36:45.759 --> 01:36:49.012
- My son is driving one of those cars.

01:36:54.893 --> 01:36:58.104
- Martin! Martin!

01:36:58.230 --> 01:37:01.066
- He called. I could've saved him.

01:37:01.942 --> 01:37:03.568
<i>- Get a hold of yourself!</i>

01:37:03.693 --> 01:37:06.279
- I could've saved him.
Now my son is gone because of me.

01:37:06.822 --> 01:37:10.659
<i>- Martin, I understand, but this isn't the time!</i>
- I killed my son.

01:37:10.784 --> 01:37:12.369
- Huh?
- I killed him.

01:37:12.494 --> 01:37:13.787
- No! No!

01:37:13.912 --> 01:37:15.205
(Sniffling)

01:37:15.330 --> 01:37:17.332
Hey! Hey, shake it off, man!

01:37:17.457 --> 01:37:18.750
(Siren wailing)

01:37:18.875 --> 01:37:20.335
He's not dead!

01:37:20.460 --> 01:37:23.964
<i>He's not dead!
There weren't any other explosions!</i>

01:37:24.089 --> 01:37:26.049
<i>But I need you now!</i>

01:37:26.174 --> 01:37:27.843
<i>Jonathan needs you!</i>

01:37:31.304 --> 01:37:32.722
- Let's find him.

01:37:32.848 --> 01:37:34.432
What are you doing? Let's go!

01:37:34.558 --> 01:37:36.059
<i>- We can't go after your son.</i>

01:37:36.184 --> 01:37:40.647
- What? Let go of me!
<i>- Penses-y.</i> Think about it.

01:37:40.772 --> 01:37:42.774
- I don't wanna save the world.
I just wanna save my son!

01:37:42.899 --> 01:37:46.903
<i>- Me too! But we won't find your son
before he crosses the border.</i>

01:37:47.028 --> 01:37:51.575
<i>The only way to save your son
is to stop the cars from exploding.</i>

01:37:53.118 --> 01:37:55.412
- OK. OK.

01:38:08.466 --> 01:38:10.927
- Everything's ready. We need to move.

01:38:12.429 --> 01:38:14.681
- Take a deep breath and relax, kid.

01:38:16.641 --> 01:38:19.978
We are gonna stick to the schedule
exactly as planned.

01:38:20.103 --> 01:38:21.938
Now, what happened this morning

01:38:22.063 --> 01:38:25.025
was just a little bump on the road.

01:38:25.150 --> 01:38:28.028
We still have 27 cars in play

01:38:28.153 --> 01:38:32.282
and nobody has a clue
about what is about to go down.

01:38:33.366 --> 01:38:34.284
(Exhaling sharply)

01:38:42.792 --> 01:38:44.085
(Exhaling sharply)

01:38:45.962 --> 01:38:48.173
Today, we write history.

01:38:48.298 --> 01:38:52.385
See, the fight for freedom
is a never-ending fight

01:38:52.510 --> 01:38:54.387
that demands sacrifice.

01:38:54.512 --> 01:38:57.974
And it is worthy of everything we got.

01:38:58.099 --> 01:39:02.062
If our neighbours are poor or defenceless,

01:39:02.187 --> 01:39:04.105
it is our duty to protect them,

01:39:04.230 --> 01:39:06.358
sometimes even against themselves.

01:39:06.483 --> 01:39:08.151
Our country,

01:39:08.276 --> 01:39:11.446
our brothers and sisters are stoned:

01:39:11.571 --> 01:39:13.281
stoned on comfort,

01:39:13.406 --> 01:39:16.409
stoned on pumpkin-spice lattes

01:39:16.534 --> 01:39:18.578
and fucking Facebook!

01:39:19.788 --> 01:39:22.749
Somebody needs to step up and save them.

01:39:22.874 --> 01:39:25.585
Not friend them. Save them.

01:39:26.711 --> 01:39:28.505
And that somebody is us.

01:39:31.174 --> 01:39:32.467
Do you know why?

01:39:34.511 --> 01:39:38.390
Because we are the true patriots.

01:39:40.642 --> 01:39:42.644
And if we succeed today,

01:39:42.769 --> 01:39:47.315
50 years from now... we'll be in every textbook.

01:39:48.483 --> 01:39:50.151
But if we fail...

01:39:52.487 --> 01:39:53.863
Shit!

01:39:53.989 --> 01:39:56.032
Those pricks don't give up!

01:39:56.157 --> 01:39:57.033
- What is it?

01:39:57.158 --> 01:39:59.202
- Fucking Canadian cops!

01:39:59.327 --> 01:40:00.412
Ali, Connor,

01:40:00.537 --> 01:40:03.248
go and do everything exactly as we planned.

01:40:03.373 --> 01:40:04.624
- Yes, sir!

01:40:04.749 --> 01:40:06.626
- You, come with me.

01:40:06.751 --> 01:40:10.714
- Sir, I wanna be a part of--
- Shut up! Don't question my orders.

01:40:10.839 --> 01:40:12.549
- No papers, no numbers today.

01:40:12.674 --> 01:40:14.217
I wanna speak to your boss.

01:40:14.342 --> 01:40:17.262
- It's protocol. You need an appointment.

01:40:17.387 --> 01:40:20.890
<i>- What part of "emergency"
don't you understand?</i>

01:40:21.016 --> 01:40:23.435
- Sir, lower your voice!

01:40:25.353 --> 01:40:26.730
(Men and women screaming)

01:40:28.857 --> 01:40:31.234
- We need to talk to the person in charge, <i>bâtard!</i>

01:40:31.359 --> 01:40:32.736
- Get down!

01:40:32.861 --> 01:40:33.862
<i>- Bon!</i>

01:40:33.987 --> 01:40:35.488
- Get down on your knees!

01:40:35.613 --> 01:40:38.324
<i>- Are they going to take us seriously now?</i>

01:40:38.450 --> 01:40:39.826
- Down on your knees!

01:40:40.452 --> 01:40:43.288
<i>- I can't take their shitty attitude anymore!</i>

01:40:43.747 --> 01:40:46.458
<i>You're lucky my friend's son
is caught up in this,</i>

01:40:46.583 --> 01:40:50.128
<i>otherwise I'd be at home
with my feet up, drinking a beer</i>

01:40:50.253 --> 01:40:54.257
<i>and watching the cars blow up live
on fucking CNN!</i>

01:40:54.382 --> 01:40:58.553
<i>I can't handle them acting
like they're king of the world,</i>

01:40:58.678 --> 01:41:01.347
<i>as if the Garden of Eden itself
was in sunny California!</i>

01:41:01.473 --> 01:41:04.601
- FBI! Everybody put your guns down!

01:41:04.726 --> 01:41:06.102
Put them down!

01:41:06.227 --> 01:41:08.146
(Alarm sounding)

01:41:08.271 --> 01:41:10.023
Put them down.

01:41:11.066 --> 01:41:14.152
I know these men.
They are Canadian police officers.

01:41:14.277 --> 01:41:15.695
They're working with us.

01:41:18.114 --> 01:41:20.950
Gentlemen! If you would please come with me.

01:41:22.243 --> 01:41:23.953
I was just about to call you.

01:41:27.290 --> 01:41:31.252
<i>- Sometimes you have to be direct
in order to get things moving.</i>

01:41:31.377 --> 01:41:33.213
Hi, I'm David.

01:41:35.507 --> 01:41:38.718
- Gentlemen, after our little misadventure
up in Maine,

01:41:38.843 --> 01:41:42.514
I decided to come down here
and check things out for myself.

01:41:42.639 --> 01:41:44.724
Turns out, you were right.

01:41:45.642 --> 01:41:48.895
That man in there
was planning a terrorist attack on American soil.

01:41:50.605 --> 01:41:52.565
But we have him now, thanks to you.

01:41:52.690 --> 01:41:54.317
And I am gonna see to it,

01:41:54.442 --> 01:41:58.071
and I'm gonna make sure
that the proper authorities know

01:41:58.196 --> 01:42:00.240
what you both have done for my country.

01:42:00.365 --> 01:42:02.158
- But there are at least 3 of them.

01:42:02.283 --> 01:42:05.245
- Yes. The other two are also in custody.

01:42:05.370 --> 01:42:07.997
We've also impounded their cars and their computers.

01:42:08.123 --> 01:42:10.416
- And you were able to locate all of the cars?

01:42:10.542 --> 01:42:11.876
- Most of them.

01:42:12.001 --> 01:42:14.546
It's only a matter of time before we get them all.

01:42:17.632 --> 01:42:18.675
- It's over?

01:42:18.800 --> 01:42:20.093
- Yes.

01:42:21.928 --> 01:42:23.763
It's done.

01:42:27.183 --> 01:42:28.268
- It's over.

01:42:28.393 --> 01:42:31.855
<i>- Martin, David, can you hear me?
I picked up the signal!</i>

01:42:32.230 --> 01:42:35.525
- I'm sorry. I'm gonna have to take this.

01:42:35.650 --> 01:42:36.860
- Of course.

01:42:36.985 --> 01:42:38.528
- Yes, MC?

01:42:38.653 --> 01:42:41.614
<i>- I've got their computer's signal!
They reconnected!</i>

01:42:42.240 --> 01:42:44.742
- Slow down. Explain this to me again.

01:42:44.868 --> 01:42:47.245
<i>- I can't hack in, but the tracker is up.</i>

01:42:47.370 --> 01:42:49.247
<i>- That's impossible, MC.</i>

01:42:49.372 --> 01:42:50.748
I'm here in the Consulate.

01:42:50.874 --> 01:42:53.751
They have the guys and the computers.

01:42:53.877 --> 01:42:55.628
<i>- I have the tracker! It's moving!</i>

01:42:56.921 --> 01:43:00.049
<i>It's on the move, but it must be
hooked up to a generator.</i>

01:43:00.175 --> 01:43:02.677
- OK. Don't lose it.

01:43:02.802 --> 01:43:04.470
Keep your line open.

01:43:04.596 --> 01:43:08.308
<i>And don't say a damn word until I call you back.</i>
Clear?

01:43:08.433 --> 01:43:10.351
- Clear!

01:43:11.769 --> 01:43:16.065
- Um, when did you get them into custody?

01:43:16.191 --> 01:43:20.445
- The suspects were brought in
at about 8:00 p.m. yesterday evening.

01:43:20.570 --> 01:43:23.615
- Then you have the wrong computers.

01:43:23.740 --> 01:43:25.992
Shit is still blowing up!

01:43:26.117 --> 01:43:27.952
Three more cars exploded this morning,

01:43:28.077 --> 01:43:31.623
which tells me that this mission
is still very much in progress.

01:43:31.748 --> 01:43:34.417
- Put your hands behind your head.

01:43:34.542 --> 01:43:37.962
Put your hands behind your head! Do it now.

01:43:38.087 --> 01:43:40.590
Turn the fuck around!

01:43:40.715 --> 01:43:42.717
- What the fuck?

01:43:42.842 --> 01:43:46.971
- I knew you were an asshole. But a traitor?

01:43:47.096 --> 01:43:48.514
- You've got it wrong.

01:43:48.640 --> 01:43:51.017
You've got it wrong! I am a patriot.

01:43:51.142 --> 01:43:54.270
You see, all of those cars are gonna blow up

01:43:54.395 --> 01:43:56.606
in front of mosques in my country.

01:43:56.731 --> 01:43:59.275
We're not gonna stand for these

01:43:59.400 --> 01:44:02.278
extremist, radical sons of bitches anymore!

01:44:02.403 --> 01:44:04.864
- And killing innocent people is your solution?

01:44:04.989 --> 01:44:07.992
- Oh, here comes the liberal,
bleeding-heart rhetoric

01:44:08.117 --> 01:44:10.536
from the more stupid breed of Canadian:

01:44:10.662 --> 01:44:12.413
the French one!

01:44:12.538 --> 01:44:14.207
No one is innocent!

01:44:14.332 --> 01:44:15.959
No one!

01:44:16.084 --> 01:44:19.545
How do you fight cancer? By talking to it?

01:44:19.671 --> 01:44:22.131
No! You eradicate it. You kill it!

01:44:22.257 --> 01:44:24.968
And I'm not even talking
about an eye for an eye here.

01:44:25.093 --> 01:44:27.720
If someone sends one of my own to hospital,

01:44:27.845 --> 01:44:31.641
I will send 3 of theirs to see Allah himself.

01:44:31.766 --> 01:44:33.518
(Groaning)

01:44:39.899 --> 01:44:42.318
<i>- Oh yeah? You want to meet a real hardhead?</i>

01:44:45.989 --> 01:44:47.073
(Both panting)

01:44:47.198 --> 01:44:48.616
- You OK?
<i>- Oh yeah!</i>

01:44:48.741 --> 01:44:51.035
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

01:44:52.662 --> 01:44:54.163
(Grunting)

01:45:00.336 --> 01:45:01.796
- Let's go!

01:45:05.717 --> 01:45:08.052
MC? Are you there?
<i>- Yes!</i>

01:45:08.177 --> 01:45:11.806
- OK. You need to get in touch with the authorities
in every major city.

01:45:11.931 --> 01:45:15.435
They're to look for cars parked near mosques,
the drivers waiting inside them.

01:45:15.560 --> 01:45:16.519
<i>- Already on it, sir!</i>

01:45:16.644 --> 01:45:18.438
- David, lose the gun. Lose the gun.
<i>- What?</i>

01:45:18.563 --> 01:45:20.148
(Alarm beeping)

01:45:39.417 --> 01:45:40.293
<i>Monsieur?</i>

01:45:40.418 --> 01:45:41.377
Shhh!

01:45:44.422 --> 01:45:47.258
<i>Without the gun,
he wouldn't have given us the car.</i>

01:45:47.383 --> 01:45:48.176
<i>Well, maybe.</i>

01:45:48.301 --> 01:45:49.594
- MC, can you hear me?
<i>- Yes, Boss!</i>

01:45:49.719 --> 01:45:52.638
- Still have the signal? You need to guide us.
We're going east on President-Kennedy.

01:45:58.227 --> 01:45:59.645
<i>- You should be close.</i>

01:46:00.688 --> 01:46:01.939
<i>He just stopped.</i>

01:46:02.065 --> 01:46:04.942
- There! The armoured truck. That must be it.

01:46:05.068 --> 01:46:06.277
- Shit!

01:46:06.402 --> 01:46:07.445
<i>- Yes, there it goes!</i>

01:46:07.570 --> 01:46:09.238
- That's it! We've got it.

01:46:22.251 --> 01:46:23.127
Watch out!

01:46:23.252 --> 01:46:24.754
(Horn honking)

01:46:26.089 --> 01:46:27.673
Shit!

01:46:45.233 --> 01:46:46.609
No space, no space!

01:46:46.734 --> 01:46:48.903
<i>- There's plenty of room!</i>
- Shit!

01:46:52.573 --> 01:46:54.200
<i>- It's tight, but we'll make it.</i>

01:46:54.325 --> 01:46:56.285
(Tires screeching)

01:47:07.422 --> 01:47:08.297
(Grunting)

01:47:13.302 --> 01:47:15.179
(Both grunting)

01:47:22.645 --> 01:47:24.105
<i>I knew we'd make it!</i>

01:47:29.819 --> 01:47:31.320
- Shit!

01:47:40.496 --> 01:47:41.581
<i>- Are you crazy?</i>

01:47:49.046 --> 01:47:51.424
- That's it. We're police officers.

01:47:52.550 --> 01:47:53.843
There's no way out!

01:47:53.968 --> 01:47:57.680
Open the doors slowly and come out.

01:47:58.973 --> 01:48:02.185
We won't hurt you.
All we wanna do is talk to you.

01:48:02.310 --> 01:48:04.020
(Man): God bless America!

01:48:04.145 --> 01:48:05.354
(Gunshot)

01:48:05.480 --> 01:48:06.564
(Body thudding)

01:48:08.649 --> 01:48:10.526
- No! Oh shit!

01:48:12.320 --> 01:48:13.488
(Beeping)

01:48:14.530 --> 01:48:15.948
Fuck!

01:48:16.073 --> 01:48:17.074
<i>- Tabernak!</i>

01:48:17.200 --> 01:48:18.784

01:48:18.910 --> 01:48:20.036
MC!

01:48:20.161 --> 01:48:21.204
<i>- I'm listening.</i>

01:48:21.329 --> 01:48:22.413
- Can you shut this thing down?

01:48:22.538 --> 01:48:26.417
<i>- No, but I found the GPS coordinates
of some of the cars.</i>

01:48:26.542 --> 01:48:29.420
- Give them to Logan.
Have him call all the local authorities.

01:48:29.545 --> 01:48:32.298
<i>- I'm on it, Boss!</i>
- Keep me posted!

01:48:32.882 --> 01:48:36.677
<i>- There's no time to find the cars and disarm them!</i>
- I know!

01:48:37.678 --> 01:48:40.139
<i>- We have to get the truck out of signal range.</i>

01:48:41.265 --> 01:48:42.558
- We could submerge it.

01:48:42.683 --> 01:48:44.769
That might work. It has to work.

01:48:45.186 --> 01:48:49.315
<i>- Submerge it! That's good!
But how the fuck do we do that?</i>

01:48:51.442 --> 01:48:55.321
<i>I know! We'll call the fire department...</i>

01:49:07.416 --> 01:49:08.417
<i>Open up!</i>

01:49:12.380 --> 01:49:14.298
<i>- I love you, my friend.</i>

01:49:14.423 --> 01:49:16.092
<i>- Man, those pills are strong!</i>

01:49:17.468 --> 01:49:19.178
<i>Martin, don't do this to me!</i>

01:49:33.985 --> 01:49:35.444
<i>Oh, sorry!</i>

01:49:36.779 --> 01:49:38.948
<i>Police! I need your bike.</i>

01:49:39.073 --> 01:49:41.784

- What are you doing?

01:50:48.517 --> 01:50:51.854
- Please, get off! Don't do this to me!
<i>- You wanna die? You'll have to kill me!</i>

01:50:51.979 --> 01:50:55.024

<i>- No way! You're my partner!</i>

01:50:55.149 --> 01:50:58.944
<i>You want to drive into the river?
Fine! Let's drive into the river!</i>

Besides, basketball is way cooler.
