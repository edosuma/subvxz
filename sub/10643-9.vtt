02:12.507 --> 02:14.092
{\an1}I decided to go on Tinder.

02:14.175 --> 02:16.594
{\an1}And my hometown is really small.

02:16.678 --> 02:18.012
{\an1}So Tinder was like, "Dude,

02:18.096 --> 02:19.681
{\an1}"there's like two people here.

02:19.764 --> 02:21.683
{\an1}"Uh, this one and this other one

02:21.766 --> 02:22.976
{\an1}"might be your sister, so you

02:23.059 --> 02:24.435
{\an1}got one person to go for."

02:24.519 --> 02:25.979
{\an1}And, uh, fortunately, I hit it

02:26.062 --> 02:28.356
{\an1}off with that one of one.

02:28.439 --> 02:29.315
{\an1}Then like we're like we keep

02:29.399 --> 02:30.316
{\an1}partying, and we go back in to

02:30.400 --> 02:31.734
{\an1}have the birthday cake for

02:31.818 --> 02:33.152
{\an1}my grandma and like singing

02:33.236 --> 02:34.904
{\an1}it drunk all together.

02:34.988 --> 02:35.697
{\an1}The next thing I know, I get

02:35.780 --> 02:37.240
{\an1}a call, and it's the Tinder

02:37.323 --> 02:38.199
{\an1}girl.

02:38.283 --> 02:39.200
{\an1}"Hey, what's up?

02:39.284 --> 02:40.410
{\an1}"What is up on you?

02:40.493 --> 02:41.953
{\an1}"We have got to kick it

02:42.036 --> 02:42.787
{\an1}sometime."

02:42.871 --> 02:43.663
{\an1}She's like, "I'm in your

02:43.746 --> 02:45.164
{\an1}"driveway.

02:45.248 --> 02:47.750
{\an1}You told me to come over."

02:47.834 --> 02:48.751
{\an1}And I see this girl, and I'm

02:48.835 --> 02:49.961
{\an1}like, all right, if I'm

02:50.044 --> 02:51.546
{\an1}gonna do this--if I'm gonna do

02:51.629 --> 02:55.550
{\an1}this getaway, I gotta just jet.

02:55.633 --> 02:57.385
{\an1}So, I just Usain Bolt down

02:57.468 --> 02:59.220
{\an1}the driveway, hop in her car,

02:59.304 --> 03:01.848
{\an1}and peel out.

03:01.931 --> 03:03.391
{\an1}I just disappear into the night

03:03.474 --> 03:05.935
{\an1}with this random girl.

03:06.019 --> 03:07.270
{\an1}And my phone dies,

03:07.353 --> 03:08.062
{\an1}and that's that.

03:08.146 --> 03:08.813
{\an1}So the next morning, I woke up,

03:08.897 --> 03:11.399
{\an1}uh, on her downstairs couch.

03:11.482 --> 03:12.400
{\an1}Like half on the couch looking

03:12.483 --> 03:14.569
{\an1}like groggy dick.

03:14.652 --> 03:16.905
{\an1}And I look over and she's there,

03:16.988 --> 03:18.573
{\an1}showered, has her keys and is

03:18.656 --> 03:20.366
{\an1}like, "It's time to go."

03:20.450 --> 03:22.535
{\an1}And, uh, I, uh--I charge up

03:22.619 --> 03:23.786
{\an1}my phone 'cause it had died.

03:23.870 --> 03:24.537
{\an1}I'm like, "Just hold it

03:24.621 --> 03:25.580
{\an1}"a second, let me just get

03:25.663 --> 03:26.331
{\an1}at least this piece

03:26.414 --> 03:27.248
{\an1}of my life together."

03:27.332 --> 03:28.416
{\an1}And the thing just starts

03:28.499 --> 03:30.418
{\an1}"ping, ping, ping."

03:30.501 --> 03:33.588
{\an1}Everyone in my family had no

03:33.671 --> 03:34.631
{\an1}idea where I went.

03:34.714 --> 03:36.382
{\an1}Like I get text from my cousin.

03:36.466 --> 03:37.133
{\an1}It's like, "Dude, like,

03:37.216 --> 03:37.926
{\an1}"joke's over.

03:38.009 --> 03:39.135
{\an1}They are really worried."

03:39.218 --> 03:40.303
{\an1}Like voicemails from my nieces

03:40.386 --> 03:41.638
{\an1}and nephews, they're like,

03:41.721 --> 03:43.598
{\an1}"Alexander, where are you?"

03:43.681 --> 03:46.601
{\an1}My mom and dad and my grandma.

03:46.684 --> 03:47.352
{\an1}I'm like, "This is gonna be

03:47.435 --> 03:48.227
{\an1}so bad."

03:48.311 --> 03:49.812
{\an1}So, I was like, "Hey, can you

03:49.896 --> 03:51.564
{\an1}just give a ride home?"

03:51.648 --> 03:52.774
{\an1}And she's like, "Fine.

03:52.857 --> 03:54.776
{\an1}Just get out of my life."

03:54.859 --> 03:55.944
{\an1}So the girl drops me off, and

03:56.027 --> 03:56.903
{\an1}I'm like, "Do I like...what's

03:56.986 --> 03:57.904
{\an1}"the etiquette here?

03:57.987 --> 03:59.781
{\an1}"Do I invite her in or pay her

03:59.864 --> 04:01.449
{\an1}money for transport?"

04:01.532 --> 04:02.492
{\an1}And she just peels out and she's

04:02.575 --> 04:04.827
{\an1}just over this interaction.

04:04.911 --> 04:07.580
{\an1}So now I'm outside my house in

04:07.664 --> 04:10.083
{\an1}my childhood driveway,

04:10.166 --> 04:11.834
{\an1}and I can see through our window

04:11.918 --> 04:13.670
{\an1}that everyone is there having

04:13.753 --> 04:14.504
{\an1}breakfast.

04:14.587 --> 04:15.755
{\an1}And I walk in for what is

04:15.838 --> 04:17.714
{\an1}undoubtedly the worst walk of

04:17.798 --> 04:19.257
{\an1}shame I've ever had.

04:19.341 --> 04:20.551
{\an1}So I creep in, and I open

04:20.635 --> 04:21.886
{\an1}the door and...

04:21.970 --> 04:22.762
{\an1}[imitates door creaking]

04:22.845 --> 04:23.846
{\an1}And they all look at me, and no

04:23.930 --> 04:26.599
{\an1}one says a word.

04:26.683 --> 04:28.267
{\an1}But you can tell so clearly

04:28.351 --> 04:29.269

04:32.146 --> 04:32.939
{\an1}My grandma gave me a look

04:33.022 --> 04:34.232
{\an1}that was basically like, "Do you

{\an1}all by myself.

05:59.400 --> 06:01.652
{\an1}The teachers came by and then,

06:01.736 --> 06:02.820
{\an1}you know, they said hi,

06:02.904 --> 06:03.988
{\an1}and then I said the okay

06:04.072 --> 06:05.490
{\an1}and everything was good.

06:05.573 --> 06:07.075
{\an1}Well, I looked down and saw it's

06:07.158 --> 06:08.743
{\an1}like I can't even see the bottom

06:08.826 --> 06:10.536
{\an1}of the ocean.

06:10.620 --> 06:12.413
{\an1}What's happening?

06:12.497 --> 06:14.082
{\an1}My friends, they're very far

06:14.165 --> 06:15.124
{\an1}from me.

06:15.208 --> 06:16.709
{\an1}So that's when I realized I was

06:16.793 --> 06:17.293
{\an1}caught in the current, and I

06:17.376 --> 06:19.337
{\an1}knew I was in trouble.

06:19.420 --> 06:21.172
{\an1}My main goal was to get

06:21.255 --> 06:22.173
{\an1}someone's attention.

06:22.256 --> 06:22.924
{\an1}[muffled screaming]

06:23.007 --> 06:23.674
{\an1}I tried to do every hand signal

06:23.758 --> 06:24.592
{\an1}they told me.

06:24.675 --> 06:25.384
{\an1}I even improvised.

06:25.468 --> 06:26.594
{\an1}I gave them the middle finger.

06:26.677 --> 06:28.137
{\an1}Actually, my friend, she thought

06:28.221 --> 06:29.222
{\an1}I was wavin' at her and she

06:29.305 --> 06:29.639
{\an1}waved back at me.

06:29.722 --> 06:32.016
{\an1}[muffled screaming]

06:32.100 --> 06:33.101
{\an1}But I was just trying to tell

06:33.184 --> 06:34.602
{\an1}them , "Hello, I'm dying here."

06:34.685 --> 06:35.728
{\an1}So, inside my head, I'm like,

06:35.812 --> 06:36.813
{\an1}"Okay, do not panic.

06:36.896 --> 06:37.814
{\an1}"Do not panic.

06:37.897 --> 06:38.815
{\an1}"Shoot, I'm panicking,

06:38.898 --> 06:39.899
{\an1}"I'm panicking! I'm panicking!

06:39.982 --> 06:40.650
{\an1}"This is it. This is it.

06:40.733 --> 06:41.400
{\an1}"I'm gonna die.

06:41.484 --> 06:42.568
{\an1}"I'm gonna become seafood.

06:42.652 --> 06:44.153
{\an1}"I won't get to graduate.

06:44.237 --> 06:45.988
{\an1}"I'm gonna die a virgin.

06:46.072 --> 06:47.031

06:47.115 --> 06:48.658
{\an1}alcohol yet!"

06:48.741 --> 06:49.659
{\an1}And I start yelling at them

06:49.742 --> 06:50.952
{\an1}because, you know, in my mind

06:51.035 --> 06:52.120
{\an1}that makes perfect sense

{\an1}[muffled screaming]

07:04.590 --> 07:05.341
{\an1}So, finally, I was able to get

07:05.424 --> 07:07.885
{\an1}to the top of the water.

07:07.969 --> 07:08.761
{\an1}They told me, "You come swim

07:08.845 --> 07:09.762
{\an1}to the boat."

07:09.846 --> 07:10.638
{\an1}I'm like, "No, I'm not swimming.

07:10.721 --> 07:11.764
{\an1}"You come get me right now.

07:11.848 --> 07:11.848

{\an1}pass out.

07:18.980 --> 07:20.481
{\an1}Everything went like...blank.

07:22.900 --> 07:24.944
{\an1}So, the instructor came swimming

07:25.027 --> 07:28.156
{\an1}towards me on a dolphin and come

07:28.239 --> 07:30.241
{\an1}and rescue me with his big

{\an1}the soft lips on my lips.

07:35.621 --> 07:36.372
{\an1}I opened my eyes and I got this

{\an1}60-year-old dude just staring

{\an1}and...I'm so disappointed.

{\an1}Scuba diving is not as easy as

07:49.927 --> 07:51.095
{\an1}I learned that the hard way.

{\an1}throughout my high school.

08:00.563 --> 08:02.148
{\an1}The story begins, I got asked to

08:02.231 --> 08:02.690
{\an1}go to another girl's prom.

08:02.773 --> 08:05.276
{\an1}I throw on my Mike the Situation

08:05.359 --> 08:06.569
{\an1}tux with a cane.

08:06.652 --> 08:07.195
{\an1}For some reason, I thought that

08:07.278 --> 08:08.112
{\an1}was cool.

08:08.196 --> 08:08.863
{\an1}We get in the limo and that's

08:08.946 --> 08:10.531
{\an1}when things kind of, uh,

08:10.615 --> 08:11.574
{\an1}take a turn.

08:11.657 --> 08:13.034
{\an1}The second the doors close,

08:13.117 --> 08:14.785
{\an1}these kids start popping

08:14.869 --> 08:15.536
{\an1}bottles.

08:15.620 --> 08:17.371
{\an1}We roll up to the hotel.

08:17.455 --> 08:19.165
{\an1}And I realized that these kids

08:19.248 --> 08:20.333
{\an1}are lit.

08:20.416 --> 08:21.083
{\an1}They step out and it's like,

08:21.167 --> 08:22.168
{\an1}"Whoa!

08:22.251 --> 08:23.502
{\an1}"Like, oh, it's just my heels.

08:23.586 --> 08:24.337
{\an1}"I don't know how to walk

08:24.420 --> 08:25.046
{\an1}in 'em."

08:25.129 --> 08:26.714
{\an1}So, we like get in, but like it

08:26.797 --> 08:29.592
{\an1}lasted about 24 minutes.

08:29.675 --> 08:30.968
{\an1}This guy comes up to our table,

08:31.052 --> 08:32.010
{\an1}and he's like, "Hey, will you

08:32.094 --> 08:32.595
{\an1}and your date come with us?"

08:32.678 --> 08:35.097
{\an1}And I'm like, "Ha-ha, I'm

08:35.181 --> 08:35.890
{\an1}"probably gonna win Prom King

08:35.972 --> 08:36.682
{\an1}again."

08:36.765 --> 08:37.558
{\an1}I'm like, "Okay, here we go,

08:37.642 --> 08:38.351
{\an1}"baby, and it ain't even

08:38.433 --> 08:39.143
{\an1}my school."

08:39.227 --> 08:40.102
{\an1}And they walk us up these

08:40.186 --> 08:42.395
{\an1}staircases, and I'm like,

08:42.480 --> 08:44.690
{\an1}"Oh, no, I ain't the king."

08:44.774 --> 08:46.317
{\an1}The room is just full of a bunch

08:46.400 --> 08:47.818
{\an1}of crying kids, and there's like

08:47.902 --> 08:49.570
{\an1}12 police officers.

08:49.654 --> 08:50.154
{\an1}You got two teachers, and you

08:50.238 --> 08:52.323
{\an1}got that one gym coach who is

08:52.406 --> 08:54.659
{\an1}still wearing a gray sweat suit.

08:54.742 --> 08:56.118
{\an1}So, they basically say, "If you

08:56.202 --> 08:56.744
{\an1}"admit to drinking, you won't

08:56.827 --> 08:58.412
{\an1}"get in trouble.

08:58.496 --> 08:59.705
{\an1}We'll just send you home."

08:59.789 --> 09:01.082
{\an1}Twenty kids raise their hands

09:01.165 --> 09:03.084
{\an1}and like, "I drank. I'm sorry."

09:03.167 --> 09:03.876
{\an1}And they start handcuffing

09:03.960 --> 09:04.877
{\an1}these kids.

09:04.961 --> 09:06.337
{\an1}This gym teacher guy, he's been

09:06.420 --> 09:07.838
{\an1}waiting for this,

09:07.922 --> 09:09.215
{\an1}like he's been excited for this

09:09.298 --> 09:10.841
{\an1}since like September, like,

09:10.925 --> 09:12.218
{\an1}"You're gonna learn today."

09:12.301 --> 09:14.220
{\an1}And I'm like, "Oh, no, this is--

09:14.303 --> 09:15.012
{\an1}I'm not having this."

09:15.096 --> 09:16.180
{\an1}I'm gonna make a dash.

09:16.264 --> 09:17.723
{\an1}But I only got one shot at this.

09:17.807 --> 09:18.724
{\an1}So, the gym teacher's standing

09:18.808 --> 09:19.141
{\an1}right next to me,

09:19.225 --> 09:21.143
{\an1}and I'm doing like a typical,

09:21.227 --> 09:22.603
{\an1}"I honestly can't believe

09:22.687 --> 09:23.604
{\an1}young kids would drink."

09:23.688 --> 09:25.564
{\an1}So these two kids start arguing

09:25.648 --> 09:26.399
{\an1}that they can't call their

09:26.482 --> 09:27.066
{\an1}parents.

09:27.149 --> 09:28.609
{\an1}And the gym teacher steps up,

09:28.693 --> 09:29.610
{\an1}"This is it! I've had it!"

09:29.694 --> 09:30.361
{\an1}He walks away.

09:30.444 --> 09:31.153
{\an1}That's my moment.

09:31.237 --> 09:32.280
{\an1}I just take off.

09:32.363 --> 09:33.239
{\an1}And I hear him yelling,

09:33.322 --> 09:33.656
{\an1}"We got a runner!"

09:33.739 --> 09:35.658
{\an1}And I'm like, vroom, I sprint,

09:35.741 --> 09:36.659
{\an1}I got my cane.

09:36.742 --> 09:37.451
{\an1}[panting]

09:37.535 --> 09:38.244
{\an1}You know the gym teacher back

09:38.327 --> 09:39.578
{\an1}there, trying to chase after me.

09:39.662 --> 09:40.663
{\an1}He gets like four steps and--

09:40.746 --> 09:41.872
{\an1}[panting]

09:41.956 --> 09:43.374
{\an1}And I like fly down the steps.

09:43.457 --> 09:44.667
{\an1}I whip into this prom, and I'm

09:44.750 --> 09:45.710
{\an1}like--I'm snakin' through

09:45.793 --> 09:46.002
{\an1}the dance.

09:46.085 --> 09:47.253
{\an1}I'm like, "What up, girls?

09:47.336 --> 09:48.421
{\an1}What's up, Johnny?"

09:48.504 --> 09:49.297
{\an1}I'm trying to like blend,

09:49.380 --> 09:50.089

09:50.172 --> 09:51.132
{\an1}I'm clearly not blending in

09:51.215 --> 09:52.633
{\an1}'cause I'm sweating.

09:52.717 --> 09:53.175
{\an1}And like right then, the gym

09:53.259 --> 09:54.885
{\an1}teacher comes up.

09:54.969 --> 09:56.637
{\an1}He's like--[panting]

09:56.721 --> 09:58.389
{\an1}"Get him! Get him!"

09:58.472 --> 09:59.598

09:59.682 --> 10:00.725
{\an1}emergency exit.

10:00.808 --> 10:02.935
{\an1}And I honestly have no idea if

10:03.019 --> 10:04.020
{\an1}anyone's actually chasing me,

10:04.103 --> 10:05.479
{\an1}at this point, but in my head,

10:05.563 --> 10:06.480
{\an1}there are like 12 police

10:06.564 --> 10:08.024
{\an1}officers, guns drawn,

10:08.107 --> 10:08.941
{\an1}coming at me like,

10:09.025 --> 10:10.151
{\an1}"Guy! Come back!"

10:10.234 --> 10:11.319
{\an1}I jump out of this window.

10:11.402 --> 10:12.194
{\an1}And like, I drop my

10:12.278 --> 10:13.654
{\an1}Mike the Situation cane.

10:13.738 --> 10:14.196

10:16.574 --> 10:17.158
{\an1}away.

10:17.241 --> 10:17.908
{\an1}And I'm laying there and I got

10:17.992 --> 10:18.784
{\an1}that moment where I'm on the

10:18.868 --> 10:20.328

10:20.411 --> 10:20.870
{\an1}and I know they're coming.

10:20.953 --> 10:22.330

17:58.452 --> 17:59.077
{\an1}So, of course, I was way under.

17:59.161 --> 18:01.330
{\an1}It turns out everyone else

18:01.413 --> 18:02.456
{\an1}bid over.

18:02.539 --> 18:03.123
{\an1}I win! I'm going nuts.

18:03.207 --> 18:05.501
{\an1}The audience is going nuts!

18:05.584 --> 18:06.376
{\an1}So I moved on to the final

18:06.460 --> 18:07.503
{\an1}round of the show.

18:07.586 --> 18:09.922
{\an1}Who is going up against me?

18:10.005 --> 18:11.632
{\an1}Her name is Tanisha.

18:11.715 --> 18:12.841
{\an1}She's been watching the show

18:12.925 --> 18:14.301
{\an1}for the past six years.

18:14.384 --> 18:15.135
{\an1}And I'm like, "Hey, good luck."

18:15.219 --> 18:17.012
{\an1}And she looks me up and down

18:17.096 --> 18:18.430
{\an1}and snaps her fingers and goes,

18:18.514 --> 18:19.765
{\an1}"Yeah, you'll need it."

18:19.848 --> 18:20.891
{\an1}And the whole audience goes,

18:20.974 --> 18:21.099
{\an1}"Oh!"

18:21.183 --> 18:23.352
{\an1}And now it's super heated.

18:23.435 --> 18:24.895
{\an1}The audience is yelling.

18:24.978 --> 18:25.896
{\an1}Tanisha's dancing.

18:25.979 --> 18:26.647
{\an1}I'm sweating.

18:26.730 --> 18:27.773
{\an1}And I'm sure she's thinking,

18:27.856 --> 18:29.191
{\an1}"I got this in the bag."

18:29.274 --> 18:31.485
{\an1}So I go up first.

18:31.568 --> 18:33.737
{\an1}"Your grand prize--a new

18:33.821 --> 18:34.905
{\an1}sailboat."

18:34.988 --> 18:36.740
{\an1}And I'm freaking out.

18:36.824 --> 18:37.825
{\an1}But after I calm down,

18:37.908 --> 18:38.325
{\an1}I look at the sailboat.

18:38.408 --> 18:41.578
{\an1}It looks really small on the

18:41.662 --> 18:42.079
{\an1}other side of the stage.

18:42.162 --> 18:43.872
{\an1}And I don't know how much does

18:43.956 --> 18:44.706
{\an1}a sailboat cost?

18:44.790 --> 18:45.457
{\an1}I thought it was like

18:45.541 --> 18:46.041
{\an1}this little dingy.

18:46.125 --> 18:46.542
{\an1}And I lean into the mic

18:46.625 --> 18:50.045
{\an1}and I go, "Drew...

18:50.128 --> 18:51.046
{\an1}$3,000."

18:51.129 --> 18:52.881
{\an1}>> AUDIENCE: [gasping]

18:52.965 --> 18:54.049
{\an1}>> Dead silence.

18:54.132 --> 18:54.675
{\an1}Drew Carey goes, "Oh, college

18:54.758 --> 18:57.636
{\an1}"kids these days.

18:57.719 --> 18:59.137
{\an1}Alex, what's your real answer?"

18:59.221 --> 19:00.138
{\an1}And all I can think is that was

19:00.222 --> 19:02.808
{\an1}my real answer.

19:02.891 --> 19:03.392
{\an1}So now, I'm standing there,

19:03.475 --> 19:04.935
{\an1}sweat patches are growing under

19:05.018 --> 19:06.436
{\an1}my arms, and the audience

19:06.520 --> 19:06.728
{\an1}is chanting.

19:06.812 --> 19:08.397
{\an1}Drew goes, "We need an answer."

19:08.480 --> 19:09.982
{\an1}"Thirty hundred dollars"

19:10.065 --> 19:11.567
{\an1}He yanks the mic and goes,

19:11.650 --> 19:12.234
{\an1}"You know there's a difference

19:12.317 --> 19:13.527
{\an1}"between thirty hundred dollars

19:13.610 --> 19:14.778
{\an1}and $30,000?"

19:14.862 --> 19:17.197
{\an1}And I go, "Ah, yeah. $30,000!"

19:17.281 --> 19:18.949
{\an1}And he goes, "Great.

19:19.032 --> 19:19.700
{\an1}We're locking it in."

19:19.783 --> 19:20.450
{\an1}Moving on.

19:20.534 --> 19:21.869
{\an1}So now, it's Tanisha's turn.

19:21.952 --> 19:22.286
{\an1}She gets an ATV.

19:22.369 --> 19:24.496
{\an1}She gets a pickup truck.

19:24.580 --> 19:25.873
{\an1}And she's just dancing and

19:25.956 --> 19:26.957
{\an1}picking her numbers, and she's

19:27.040 --> 19:27.040
{\an1}so confident.

19:27.040 --> 19:29.960
{\an7}And then it's finally time to

19:30.043 --> 19:32.045
{\an7}reveal the prices.

19:32.129 --> 19:34.381
{\an7}Tanisha's off by $1,400.

19:34.464 --> 19:35.382
{\an7}She's really close.

19:35.465 --> 19:35.465
{\an7}And she goes nuts, pretty much

19:35.465 --> 19:39.511
{\an1}is thanking God for her new car.

19:39.595 --> 19:40.888
{\an1}And I'm standing there thinking,

19:40.971 --> 19:41.430
{\an1}"Okay, if I leave the studio

19:41.513 --> 19:44.057
{\an1}"now, I can get to school in

19:44.141 --> 19:45.058
{\an1}"an hour and a half.

19:45.142 --> 19:46.101
{\an1}"I still have six hours to study

19:46.184 --> 19:47.519
{\an1}"for Bio, three hours to study

19:47.603 --> 19:47.769
{\an1}for Chem."

19:47.853 --> 19:49.438
{\an1}And they go, "Alex, you

19:49.521 --> 19:50.814
{\an1}guessed, uuuh."

19:50.898 --> 19:51.565
{\an1}And I'm not listening,

19:51.648 --> 19:51.940
{\an1}I'm about to walk

19:52.024 --> 19:53.817
{\an1}off, and the producers keep

19:53.901 --> 19:55.611
{\an1}looking at me going, "Smile."

19:55.694 --> 19:55.694
{\an1}And I think,

19:55.694 --> 19:57.863
{\an7}"Wow, they're jerks."

19:57.946 --> 19:57.946
{\an7}And I see my podium is flashing.

19:57.946 --> 20:02.910
{\an1}I guessed $30,000.

20:02.993 --> 20:04.494
{\an1}Retail price--

20:07.998 --> 20:09.666
{\an1}And my face literally goes from

20:09.750 --> 20:11.877
{\an1}this to ahhhh!

20:11.960 --> 20:12.878
{\an1}I'm hugging Drew Carey.

20:12.961 --> 20:13.629
{\an1}I'm dancing with the super

20:13.712 --> 20:14.463
{\an1}models.

20:14.546 --> 20:14.546
{\an1}I'm jumping on the sailboat.

20:14.546 --> 20:16.673
{\an4}I get the boat, and I leave the

20:16.757 --> 20:19.801
{\an4}studio freaking out at the fact

20:19.885 --> 20:21.678
{\an4}that this actually worked.

20:21.762 --> 20:23.180
{\an4}Didn't sail the boat, but I sold

20:23.263 --> 20:26.058
{\an4}the [bleep] for a ton of money.
