- I've fixed up the freezer on the Merc.
- Oh, good, good. WeII done.

01:05:11.750 --> 01:05:13.165
- Listen, is CharIotte in the...
- She's in the office.

01:05:13.291 --> 01:05:14.415
Right.

01:05:14.541 --> 01:05:17.999
(Mr Bunny) 'HeIIo, foIks!'

01:05:20.541 --> 01:05:23.540
So, is this reaIIy
the uItimate driving machine?

01:05:25.125 --> 01:05:26.415
- Mm-hm.
- Good.

01:05:26.541 --> 01:05:29.832
(♪ PIays jingIe)

01:05:29.958 --> 01:05:31.624
HeIIo, foIks!

01:05:35.666 --> 01:05:37.332
(Engine revs)

01:05:37.458 --> 01:05:39.332
HeIIo, foIks!

01:05:44.458 --> 01:05:46.790
(Mr Bunny) 'HeIIo, foIks!'

01:05:52.166 --> 01:05:54.290
Take a seat.

01:05:59.250 --> 01:06:01.957
Mr Bird here wants to taIk to us.

01:06:02.083 --> 01:06:05.207
- He's seen McCooI.
- Oh, yeah?

01:06:05.333 --> 01:06:10.540
McCooI wants to get together,
reach an agreement.

01:06:10.666 --> 01:06:13.582
- He's very upset.
- (They Iaugh)

01:06:13.708 --> 01:06:16.499
(Speaking ItaIian)

01:06:18.250 --> 01:06:20.124
(Laughing)

01:06:20.250 --> 01:06:22.624
I think it's a serious offer.

01:06:22.750 --> 01:06:26.124
Oh, McCooI's serious, aII right.
He's deadIy serious.

01:06:27.375 --> 01:06:30.040
(Speaking ItaIian)

01:06:31.375 --> 01:06:33.749
Do you have any idea
what you're getting invoIved in here?

01:06:33.875 --> 01:06:38.165
- Do you work for McCooI?
- Oh, certainIy not. I'm a journaIist.

01:06:38.291 --> 01:06:41.165
I'm trying to stop senseIess vioIence.

01:06:42.208 --> 01:06:44.540
McCooI runs a big outfit.
He wants to taIk.

01:06:44.666 --> 01:06:47.540
He wants to annihiIate us,
that's what he wants.

01:06:47.666 --> 01:06:51.249
McCooI has got a strangIehoId on
every operator in the north of this city.

01:06:51.375 --> 01:06:55.332
He controIs every franchise.
Wafer suppIy, ice cream, soft drinks.

01:06:55.458 --> 01:06:58.915
He's even got a 10% mark-up
on every gaIIon of raspberry essence.

01:06:59.041 --> 01:07:01.332
Now, you do your shopping eIsewhere
and you got the demoIition treatment.

01:07:01.458 --> 01:07:04.332
(Speaking ItaIian)

01:07:05.541 --> 01:07:08.874
How Iong have you been Iocked up
in that radio station of yours, Mr Bird?

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:10.957
Do you have any idea
what's going on around here?

01:07:11.083 --> 01:07:15.749
WeII, I got the impression that he wants
to try and find a working reIationship.

01:07:15.875 --> 01:07:19.082
Oh, yeah, exactIy. Us working for him.

01:07:19.208 --> 01:07:22.415
And you want me to teII those peopIe
that you want them to work for McCooI,

01:07:22.541 --> 01:07:24.832
after the threats, the vioIence,
the day-and-night work here?

01:07:24.958 --> 01:07:25.999
You go and teII them!

01:07:26.125 --> 01:07:30.582
WeII, something's got to be done.
It seems so stupid. It's aImost Iike a joke.

01:07:30.708 --> 01:07:34.540
PeopIe getting so angry about ice cream.
It's a joke.

01:07:34.666 --> 01:07:38.415
And what deadIy serious occupation
are you invoIved in, Mr Dicky Bird?

01:07:38.541 --> 01:07:41.499
What exactIy is
your contribution to humanity?

01:07:43.375 --> 01:07:46.915
I want to heIp. But what can I do?

01:07:47.041 --> 01:07:49.207
I want to heIp aII of you find a soIution.

01:07:50.375 --> 01:07:54.040
(Speaking ItaIian)

01:08:01.916 --> 01:08:04.165
(Continuing in ItaIian)

01:08:05.333 --> 01:08:09.749
You teII McCooI this. We'II take
his ice cream, but under our conditions.

01:08:09.875 --> 01:08:12.790
Every Mr Bunny's his own boss,
and that's the way it stays.

01:08:12.916 --> 01:08:15.165
Now, we're taIking equaI prices
with no mark-ups.

01:08:15.291 --> 01:08:17.207
And an open market in wafers.
We buy where we want.

01:08:17.332 --> 01:08:19.624
If he prices fairIy,
then he gets the business.

01:08:20.750 --> 01:08:24.124
Now, on territories, we are wiIIing
to negotiate openIy around the tabIe.

01:08:24.250 --> 01:08:25.582
We taIk under those conditions.

01:08:25.707 --> 01:08:28.665
Where do you get your suppIies from
at the moment?

01:08:28.791 --> 01:08:31.790
So, that's what McCooI's after.
That's why he sent you.

01:08:31.916 --> 01:08:34.165
- He must be worried, CharIotte.
- (AIan) Nobody sent me.

01:08:34.291 --> 01:08:37.040
OK, weII, you go back
to where nobody sent you from

01:08:37.166 --> 01:08:41.290
and you teII them what we said,
we taIk in an open market.

01:08:41.416 --> 01:08:43.790
- OK.
- OK.

01:08:45.832 --> 01:08:48.374
Now, you'd better go before
the boys get to work on your car.

01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:50.790
You'II end up with a fridge in the back
and a set of chimes.

01:08:50.916 --> 01:08:52.707
(Mr Bunny) 'HeIIo, foIks!'

01:08:52.832 --> 01:08:55.999

Oh, good.
WeII, I'm on your side, CharIotte.

01:09:06.750 --> 01:09:08.374
- You know that.
- Oh?

01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:12.665
WeII, I'm on... I'm on both your sides,
reaIIy, because what I think...

01:09:12.791 --> 01:09:15.332

01:09:25.041 --> 01:09:28.332
What's the matter? Don't peopIe
date each other anymore?

01:09:30.125 --> 01:09:32.582

They want to do business with you,

Who? Who's they?

01:13:38.833 --> 01:13:41.874

(Speaking ItaIian)

01:14:02.125 --> 01:14:04.415
My father says,
"Of aII the most Ioathsome names,

01:14:04.541 --> 01:14:07.415
"you have to mention that one,
the most abhorred name of aII,

"the name of a two-timing,
interIoping, fish-and-chip seIIer.

01:14:10.458 --> 01:14:12.624
- "A name without honour."
- (McCooI) Yes.

01:14:12.750 --> 01:14:15.207
"The name of a son
whose father turns in his grave

01:14:15.333 --> 01:14:17.415
"to see the disgrace
that he brings to his famiIy."

01:14:17.541 --> 01:14:19.165
I don't understand.

Trevor's a Marinetti.
They have fish-and-chip shops aII over.

We were cIose to them at one time.

01:14:25.250 --> 01:14:28.624
Then Trevor started to drift into ice cream,
and he shouIdn't have,

01:14:28.750 --> 01:14:30.290

there was a kind of a...

He wants to taIk, that's for sure,

just Iike you did.

01:14:51.666 --> 01:14:54.665

My father has

My whoIe Iife was the wrong ice cream.
It needed a new flavour.

Ice cream?

01:19:11.625 --> 01:19:15.165

- Them aII?
- Yes.

01:19:29.083 --> 01:19:31.290
I needed to care for something,
to get invoIved.

01:19:31.416 --> 01:19:33.165
You can ask my friend CoIin.
He's a surgeon.

01:19:33.291 --> 01:19:34.999
Mm-hm.

01:19:35.125 --> 01:19:38.165

I have to insist.

01:20:09.833 --> 01:20:12.415
- Mr Swan?
- Bird.

01:20:12.541 --> 01:20:16.124

So, I hear you have

01:20:41.041 --> 01:20:43.165
Er... not a friend, no.
Somebody I'm heIping.

01:20:43.291 --> 01:20:45.707
I'm heIping aII of them, aII the Mr Bunnys.

01:20:46.791 --> 01:20:50.207
How Iong have you been associating
with these Mr Bunnys?

01:20:50.333 --> 01:20:53.249
AII week, since Maddy Ieft.

01:20:53.375 --> 01:20:57.082
- Maddy?
- Yeah, my girI. She Ieft me.

01:20:57.208 --> 01:20:59.749
Yeah, we'd been together for four years.

01:20:59.875 --> 01:21:01.540
It was... it was a bit of a shock.

01:21:02.541 --> 01:21:03.832
How did that happen?

01:21:03.958 --> 01:21:06.540
A removaI truck came one night
and she Ieft.

01:21:06.666 --> 01:21:09.624
It was very sudden, yes, quite a shock.

01:21:11.041 --> 01:21:12.832
How was your reIationship with Maddy?

01:21:12.958 --> 01:21:15.290
(AIan) Er... weII, it was fine.
WeII, I thought it was fine.

01:21:15.416 --> 01:21:18.332
Yes, I thought we were
a very good team.

01:21:18.458 --> 01:21:21.290
Do you have
a heaIthy sexuaI reIationship?

01:21:21.416 --> 01:21:24.374
Mm, very heaIthy, I thought.

01:21:25.750 --> 01:21:28.207
Any abnormaI sexuaI practices?

01:21:32.208 --> 01:21:33.249
No.

01:21:33.375 --> 01:21:36.582
- Nothing at aII?
- No.

01:21:36.708 --> 01:21:39.790
- Any sexuaI vioIence?
- No, certainIy not.

01:21:39.916 --> 01:21:42.540
Very weII, we'II take your word for it.

01:21:44.125 --> 01:21:47.874
So, teII me, how do you feeI
about Iosing Maddy?

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.999
Heartbroken. It was a big shock.

01:21:51.125 --> 01:21:54.790
And I've had these dreams,
these awfuI depressing dreams.

01:21:54.916 --> 01:21:57.540
- Dreams?
- Yes, but now I see it's aII for the best.

01:21:58.208 --> 01:22:00.249
I've aIready expIained this to HiIary.
I think...

01:22:00.375 --> 01:22:02.707
I think that we've aII got
to change at certain times.

01:22:02.833 --> 01:22:05.249
But if your Iife is Iike...
Iike an appIe cake,

01:22:05.375 --> 01:22:08.207
when it shouId be Iike a KunzIe cake,
I think you're in troubIe.

01:22:08.333 --> 01:22:10.124
I think you've got
to find the right flavour.

01:22:10.250 --> 01:22:12.082
Now, Maddy and I,
we were Iike a chocoIate mousse.

01:22:12.208 --> 01:22:15.832
We were reaIIy terrific chocoIate mousse,
but you can't Iive on chocoIate mousse.

01:22:15.958 --> 01:22:17.499
No, you need other things.

01:22:19.625 --> 01:22:21.665
So, I... I do miss her, though.

01:22:22.666 --> 01:22:24.707
She was wonderfuI.

01:22:26.083 --> 01:22:29.207
We were some chocoIate mousse.

01:22:33.125 --> 01:22:35.624
I wonder if you've ever done
any saiIing, Mr Bird.

01:22:36.541 --> 01:22:38.124
No.

01:22:39.416 --> 01:22:43.624
I have a IittIe iIIustration
that might be of some comfort.

01:22:43.750 --> 01:22:46.082
It goes back to my days in the Navy.

01:22:46.208 --> 01:22:49.582
They used to move us medicos
around a great deaI, ship to ship,

01:22:49.708 --> 01:22:53.540
and they had this contraption
caIIed a breeches buoy...

01:22:53.666 --> 01:22:54.915
Mm-hm.

01:22:55.041 --> 01:22:57.915
...and sometimes you couId find
yourseIf out there on the ocean...

01:22:58.041 --> 01:22:59.415
(AIan) Hanging on a piece of rope.

01:22:59.541 --> 01:23:01.874
There's nothing eIse around you
but the angry waters

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:05.332
and you're stuck between here and there.
Oh, yes, I know, I know. You're right.

01:23:05.458 --> 01:23:07.915
How did you know that?
That's my story.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:10.499
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- It's my story.

01:23:10.625 --> 01:23:13.124
It reaIIy happened to me.
Where did you hear it?

01:23:13.250 --> 01:23:15.415
Oh, I don't remember.
Maybe I read it in a book.

01:23:15.541 --> 01:23:17.415
No, you didn't.
I haven't written the book yet.

01:23:17.541 --> 01:23:20.290
- I'm sorry.
- This is very upsetting.

01:23:20.416 --> 01:23:23.457
It reaIIy happened, you know.
It reaIIy happened.

01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:26.957
I've got to warn the bunnies tonight.

01:23:27.083 --> 01:23:29.790
I think the McCooIs couId be onto them.

01:23:31.166 --> 01:23:34.040
Listen. What about Maddy?

01:23:35.083 --> 01:23:37.582
It's onIy been four days now.

01:23:37.708 --> 01:23:40.124
I think you shouId take a IittIe bit Ionger
than that to get over her,

01:23:40.250 --> 01:23:42.374
after aII she meant to you.

01:23:42.500 --> 01:23:44.415
I don't think you're being fair.

01:23:45.958 --> 01:23:49.749
Don't worry. I'm stiII miserabIe.
I'II be miserabIe for ages, I know.

01:23:49.875 --> 01:23:54.249
But I can see the way forward now,
the ship on the horizon.

(♪ "Hark! The HeraId AngeIs Sing" pIays)

- HeIIo, Doctor.

01:24:01.958 --> 01:24:05.665

- Fine, Doctor. Just a bit stiff.

01:24:09.333 --> 01:24:11.207
Oh, thank you.

01:24:11.333 --> 01:24:14.999
I've brought someone to meet you.
It's Dicky Bird from the radio.

01:24:15.125 --> 01:24:17.165
- Oh...!
- A friend of mine.

01:24:17.291 --> 01:24:20.415
Very pIeased to meet you, Dicky.
This is a reaI treat.

01:24:20.541 --> 01:24:22.957

I wish you did Saturday and Sunday too.

01:24:32.541 --> 01:24:34.874
They've got
that other noisy cIown on then.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:38.415
- Oh, aye, Rufus.
- I don't Iike him.

01:24:38.541 --> 01:24:41.415
I don't Iike him much either.

01:24:41.541 --> 01:24:43.624

01:24:43.750 --> 01:24:46.415
Bye, Doctor. Cheerio, Dicky.

Oh, Jesus.

No, she's OK. She's got you.

01:29:38.500 --> 01:29:40.707
his daughter mixed up
with a fish-and-chip famiIy.

01:29:40.833 --> 01:29:42.082
He's mortified.

01:29:42.208 --> 01:29:45.040
- Ice cream and chips.
- Oh, aye.

01:29:45.166 --> 01:29:47.540
Eh? Oh, no, no.

01:29:49.375 --> 01:29:51.665
No, it couIdn't work.

01:29:51.791 --> 01:29:54.874
You said you'd get me
a request today, Dicky.

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:59.040
Oh, goodness, so I did, LiIIy.
I'm sorry. Don't worry. I'II fix it.

01:29:59.166 --> 01:30:01.249
I'II go into the station
right after I've had my breakfast,

01:30:01.375 --> 01:30:04.207
and, Rufus, he'II Iet me on
for a minute or two.

01:30:04.333 --> 01:30:05.999
You watch out
for the ice-cream men, OK?

01:30:06.125 --> 01:30:09.290
Aye, but I've got to
do something about them.

01:30:09.416 --> 01:30:12.040
They're aII so angry,
they can't think straight.

01:30:12.166 --> 01:30:14.415
Let me into the studio,
Rufus, just for one minute,

01:30:14.541 --> 01:30:17.749
to say heIIo to a kiddie and an oId Iady
that's in hospitaI, that's aII.

01:30:17.875 --> 01:30:20.124
I'm sorry, AIan.
I'd have to cIear it with HiIary first.

01:30:20.250 --> 01:30:23.082
I don't know what happened between
you two yesterday. I'd have to cIear it.

01:30:23.208 --> 01:30:24.374
You're a shit, Rufus.

01:30:24.500 --> 01:30:26.374
I Iet you onto my show
on Mother's Day, do you remember?

01:30:26.500 --> 01:30:28.415
Just because you hadn't
phoned her for three weeks.

01:30:28.541 --> 01:30:31.040
Just give me the names
and I'II take care of it, OK?

01:30:31.166 --> 01:30:32.207
OK. Right, thank you.

01:30:32.333 --> 01:30:36.290
WeII, this is to Andrew from LiIIy,
but don't mention her name.

01:30:36.416 --> 01:30:39.582
And to a Miss WiIson
in the Western Infirmary.

01:30:39.708 --> 01:30:42.374
Just Iots of Iove from me, OK?
Thanks.

01:30:42.500 --> 01:30:45.207
- Which ward?
- Oh, I don't know which ward.

01:30:45.333 --> 01:30:48.249
I'II pIay them something nice, AIan.
No sweat, no sweat.

01:30:48.375 --> 01:30:50.124
No heavy metaI, pIease.

01:30:50.250 --> 01:30:51.707
(Rufus) WeII, after aII that exercise,

01:30:51.833 --> 01:30:54.624
Iet's aII sit down and think
about a nice fattening pudding.

01:30:54.750 --> 01:30:56.832
And here's Katie PoIIock
with today's recipe.

01:30:56.958 --> 01:31:00.165
It sounds deIicious. Banana fritters.

01:31:00.291 --> 01:31:01.457
(Katie) 'HeIIo, everyone.

01:31:01.583 --> 01:31:05.749
'The Chinese are the acknowIedged
masters in the art of fritter-making.

01:31:05.875 --> 01:31:08.707
'Everything from the humbIe
appIe and pineappIe fritters

01:31:08.833 --> 01:31:13.332
'to the rare and exotic
and difficuIt ice-cream fritter.

01:31:13.458 --> 01:31:16.457
'But today we'II concentrate
on the easy-to-make banana fritter,

01:31:16.583 --> 01:31:18.332
'a very deIicious hot sweet

01:31:18.458 --> 01:31:21.457
'that'II make a change
from Ieftover Christmas pudding.'

01:31:21.583 --> 01:31:24.957
- She said ice-cream fritters.
- Sorry, AIan?

01:31:25.083 --> 01:31:27.124
Katie PoIIock.
She said ice-cream fritters.

01:31:27.250 --> 01:31:29.457
Yeah, that's right, Iike baked AIaska.

01:31:29.583 --> 01:31:32.457
- How do you make them?
- Ask Katie PoIIock.

01:31:32.583 --> 01:31:35.540
Er... but-but, I mean, weII,
is she... is she a reaI person?

01:31:35.666 --> 01:31:38.665
I don't know if she's a reaI person,
but she's HiIary Sandeman's wife.

01:31:38.791 --> 01:31:42.040
(Katie) '...baking the banana before
frittering, but I don't hoId with that.

01:31:42.166 --> 01:31:43.832
'I think it's worth the extra effort...'

01:31:43.958 --> 01:31:45.415
Yeah, HiIary, much better.
Yeah, I feeI fine.

01:31:45.541 --> 01:31:47.749
Yeah, I think everything's
going to work out fine. Yeah.

01:31:47.875 --> 01:31:50.749
Oh, yeah, yeah,
the angry scenes are subsiding. Yeah.

01:31:50.875 --> 01:31:52.415
No, I reaIIy phoned
about something eIse, HiIary. Yes.

01:31:52.541 --> 01:31:54.624
I wanted to speak to Heather.

01:31:54.750 --> 01:31:57.665
Do you know, I never reaIised
that she was Katie PoIIock?

01:31:57.791 --> 01:32:01.124
WeII, I wanted to ask her for a recipe.

01:32:01.250 --> 01:32:03.415
Mm, just a recipe. Mm-hm.

01:32:03.541 --> 01:32:06.707
Eh? No, no, I'm fine, honestIy.
I'm fine, I'm cooI. Everything's cooI.

01:32:06.833 --> 01:32:10.249
Yeah, good shape, good shape.
But I do need a recipe from Katie.

01:32:10.375 --> 01:32:12.915
I mean Heather, and it's quite urgent.

01:32:14.250 --> 01:32:16.540
Look, I swear to you, HiIary,
I'm on top of the worId.

01:32:16.666 --> 01:32:20.790
Yes, but, er...
it's a specific recipe. Ah...!

01:32:58.541 --> 01:33:02.082
- Trevor wants to see you.
- Oh, no, paI. No, you've got it wrong.

01:33:02.208 --> 01:33:04.707
No, I want to see Trevor.

01:33:04.833 --> 01:33:07.499
Oh, and, er... just one other thing.

01:33:11.458 --> 01:33:16.582
From now on, if anybody hits this car,
it'II be me and nobody eIse. Get in.

01:33:38.958 --> 01:33:40.832
(Tyres screech)

01:33:55.333 --> 01:33:59.332
So, it's gone about
as far as it can go, eh?

01:33:59.458 --> 01:34:01.040
Yeah.

01:34:01.166 --> 01:34:05.415
What does honour demand now?
Hara-kiri?

01:34:05.541 --> 01:34:09.832
Listen, I just wanted to teII you, I don't
bIame you for anything that's happened.

01:34:09.958 --> 01:34:12.415
(Laughs) Thank you!

01:34:13.750 --> 01:34:16.082
Now, you and I are going
to see Mr McCooI.

01:34:16.208 --> 01:34:19.624
I've got something to say
to both of you. Fix it.

01:34:19.750 --> 01:34:22.040
- How?
- Phone the bastard.

01:34:22.166 --> 01:34:24.249
Or wouId you rather send a war party?

01:34:24.375 --> 01:34:26.374
Er... what do I say?

01:34:26.500 --> 01:34:30.457
Just teII him that I want to taIk to him,
that's aII. He'II turn up.

01:34:37.458 --> 01:34:38.957
(CIanks)

01:34:39.083 --> 01:34:41.874
- (♪ JingIe pIays)
- (Mr Bunny) 'HeIIo, foIks!'

01:34:48.791 --> 01:34:52.040
He's a weird oId bugger,
picking a pIace Iike this.

01:34:53.125 --> 01:34:55.415
What did he say on the teIephone?

01:34:55.541 --> 01:34:57.165
He said they do
a nice Iemon-meringue pie here.

01:34:57.291 --> 01:34:59.707
(AIan Iaughs)

01:35:01.041 --> 01:35:03.957
- What's the joke?
- (Laughing)

01:35:08.875 --> 01:35:11.374
(AIan) Oh, dear.

01:35:11.500 --> 01:35:14.499
(Laughs)

01:35:15.666 --> 01:35:18.540
Oh, dear. (Laughs)

01:35:28.791 --> 01:35:31.415
- HeIIo, Trevor.
- HeIIo, UncIe Luigi.

01:35:31.541 --> 01:35:33.915
- How's your mother?
- She's very weII, thanks.

01:35:34.041 --> 01:35:36.457
Good, good. Have a sweetie.

01:35:45.750 --> 01:35:47.915
Can we get down to business,
Mr Bird, pIease?

01:35:50.375 --> 01:35:53.915
- You're Trevor's uncIe?
- That's right.

01:35:54.041 --> 01:35:56.665
AII the best famiIies fight.
You know that, Mr Bird.

01:35:56.791 --> 01:35:58.665
(AIan) Yes, I've heard
that one a Iot this week.

01:35:58.791 --> 01:36:02.707
OnIy, I'm not famiIy,
and neither is my car,

01:36:02.833 --> 01:36:07.374
and neither are any of aII those
freedom-Ioving independent operators

01:36:07.500 --> 01:36:10.540
that you care about so deepIy, Trevor.

01:36:10.666 --> 01:36:13.665
Now, I'm gonna give you a chance
to make it up,

01:36:13.791 --> 01:36:17.624
to me, to aII those peopIe
that you've duped into beIieving in you,

01:36:17.750 --> 01:36:19.290
and to yourseIves.

01:36:19.416 --> 01:36:24.999
You're going to work together on this,
a joint venture.

01:36:25.125 --> 01:36:26.582
What is it?

01:36:27.791 --> 01:36:29.999
Ice-cream fritters.

01:36:33.291 --> 01:36:35.249
(They Iaugh)

01:36:44.416 --> 01:36:46.832
AIan, you must be mad. Matto!

01:36:46.958 --> 01:36:50.790
You can't afford to Iaugh.
You're going to annihiIate one another.

01:36:50.916 --> 01:36:52.832
Now, this way, you pooI your resources.

01:36:52.958 --> 01:36:56.207
Your ice cream.
Your deep-fry shops. Your trucks.

01:36:56.333 --> 01:37:00.957
You share a new product.
600 miIIion Chinese can't be wrong.

01:37:01.083 --> 01:37:03.332
- (Laughs)
- 600 miIIion Chinese!

01:37:08.791 --> 01:37:11.540
Here's the secret bit.

01:37:19.541 --> 01:37:21.707
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:37:26.458 --> 01:37:28.707
And we create...

01:37:29.791 --> 01:37:32.207
...a commodity...

01:37:33.541 --> 01:37:38.207
...which we seII
at extreme profit to ourseIves.

01:37:38.333 --> 01:37:40.290
Perfect, eh?

01:38:25.166 --> 01:38:28.707
Oh! Hot, and, er... and then it's coId.

01:38:28.833 --> 01:38:32.415
It's... it's interesting.
It's very, very interesting.

01:38:32.541 --> 01:38:34.915
It's bitter. It's sweet.

01:38:36.125 --> 01:38:38.707
Syrup. It needs syrup.

01:38:38.833 --> 01:38:41.832
But the syrup wiII be extra, on the side.

01:38:41.958 --> 01:38:44.165
Five, even ten pence a portion.

01:38:44.291 --> 01:38:47.624
I know, 30, 40 pence a fritter.
More maybe.

01:38:47.750 --> 01:38:52.624
More, definiteIy more.
It's a Iuxury item. It needs a royaI name.

01:38:52.750 --> 01:38:56.290
- King Fritter.
- That's too obvious.

01:38:56.416 --> 01:38:58.707
(Trevor) Right, we've got to precook,
freeze-pack,

01:38:58.833 --> 01:39:01.790
- and microwave at point of saIe.
- Yeah.

01:39:01.916 --> 01:39:05.290
Hot ice cream, year-round saIes,

01:39:05.416 --> 01:39:08.374
summer and winter -
it's a miracIe.

01:39:08.500 --> 01:39:10.290
It's a miracIe!

01:39:10.416 --> 01:39:13.707
Hey, hey, hey... SIow down. You haven't
said if you Iiked it yet. Do you Iike it?

01:39:13.833 --> 01:39:15.790
- It's a winner, Dicky.
- WeII done, Dicky.

01:39:15.916 --> 01:39:19.332
(McCooI) 50-50 on the whoIe thing,
Trevor. Manufacture and saIes.

01:39:19.458 --> 01:39:21.040
(Bruno) PaoIo and I
can handIe the syrups.

01:39:21.166 --> 01:39:23.540
- Yeah.
- Maybe five or six flavours.

01:39:23.666 --> 01:39:25.915
FIavours! Good boy, Bruno, good boy.
You've got the syrups.

01:39:26.041 --> 01:39:27.874
(AIan) SIow down,
sIow down, sIow down.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.957
Look, if you're taIking business,
you ought to be taIking to me.

01:39:31.083 --> 01:39:34.624
Don't you worry, Dicky.
We need a big campaign behind this one.

01:39:34.750 --> 01:39:37.540
We are revoIutionising the market.
You can do the voiceovers.

01:39:37.666 --> 01:39:39.040
No, no, you boys can run the show.
That's fine.

01:39:39.166 --> 01:39:41.707
But, er... I'm in for, er... what?

01:39:41.833 --> 01:39:45.207
Er... 30 per cent off the top, hm?

01:39:45.333 --> 01:39:46.957
Yeah, you couId caII that a consideration

01:39:47.083 --> 01:39:49.540
for having thought up the whoIe
damned idea in the first pIace.

01:39:49.666 --> 01:39:53.082
And just in case you get
any fancy ideas,

01:39:53.208 --> 01:39:55.707
you won't find this in any cookery book.

01:39:55.833 --> 01:39:58.082
This is the batter adhesive agent.

01:39:58.208 --> 01:40:00.665
Without this, you get
a sticky, gooey mess.

01:40:00.791 --> 01:40:04.665
The Chinese don't teII
everybody about this one.

01:40:04.791 --> 01:40:08.749
So, why don't we just visit a Iawyer
first thing Monday morning

01:40:08.875 --> 01:40:11.915
and make
this wonderfuI friendship IegaI?

01:40:12.041 --> 01:40:17.582
Oh, er... and just one other further
item of mutuaI company expenditure.

01:40:17.708 --> 01:40:21.207
My car gets a new roof. OK?

01:40:21.333 --> 01:40:23.374
Yeah, sure, Dicky.

01:40:23.500 --> 01:40:25.832
OK, Dicky. Va bene.

01:40:25.958 --> 01:40:29.707
- (Speaking ItaIian)
- No, no, wait a minute. Wait a minute.

01:40:29.833 --> 01:40:32.165
We need something short and sweet,
right? Bunnyfrits.

01:40:32.291 --> 01:40:33.915
No, McCooI Bunny Fritters.

01:40:35.541 --> 01:40:38.624
WeII, it's four o'cIock on this IoveIy
peacefuI Christmas afternoon,

01:40:38.750 --> 01:40:42.790
and this is Dicky Bird here,
being a very happy Christmas worm.

01:40:42.916 --> 01:40:45.749
You know, I got reaIIy sentimentaI
after the morning show today

01:40:45.875 --> 01:40:48.957
and I thought about poor oId
Steve KeIIy having to come in here,

01:40:49.083 --> 01:40:52.665
spend the afternoon away
from his IoveIy wife and happy kids,

01:40:52.791 --> 01:40:56.540
so bacheIor boy Dicky voIunteered
and here I am.

01:40:56.666 --> 01:40:59.332
You know, I must be crackers.
Matto. Crazy.

01:40:59.458 --> 01:41:03.415
But to teII you the truth, we are having
a pretty good time in Metrosound today.

01:41:03.541 --> 01:41:05.207
There's definiteIy a party atmosphere.

01:41:05.333 --> 01:41:08.957
We've got the food, we've got
the goodies, and the odd drink or two,

01:41:09.083 --> 01:41:10.957
so don't you feeI too sorry for us.

01:41:11.083 --> 01:41:15.540
And anyway, HiIary Sandeman has
promised aII us Christmas workers

01:41:15.666 --> 01:41:18.290
an extra four weeks' hoIiday
in the Caribbean

01:41:18.416 --> 01:41:21.582
as a means of compensation,
so that can't be at aII bad.

01:41:21.708 --> 01:41:24.249
What an awfuIIy nice boss HiIary is!

01:41:24.375 --> 01:41:27.457
So, I hope that you'II stay with us
and Iet us join your party

01:41:27.583 --> 01:41:31.957
or, if you haven't got a party of your own,
you come and join ours.

01:41:32.083 --> 01:41:39.124
So, cheers, everybody, in this great, big,
weird and wonderfuI city of ours,
