What time?

00:28.988 --> 00:30.281
(SNIFFING)
4:30.

00:30.407 --> 00:33.368
- Why so late?
- Make-up test in social studies.

00:34.077 --> 00:35.954
Did you invite
Shelby for Saturday?

00:36.079 --> 00:36.913
No.

00:37.038 --> 00:38.623
- Do you want me to call her?
- Yeah, that'd be great.

00:38.748 --> 00:41.209
You calling a 12-year-old girl
for a sleepover.

00:41.334 --> 00:43.002
- It'll be fine.
- Make you a deal.

00:43.128 --> 00:45.046
I'll call a friend
when you call a friend.

00:45.964 --> 00:47.132
(SIGHS)

00:48.383 --> 00:49.926
It's your birthday.
Do what you want.

00:50.051 --> 00:51.386
Thank you. Bye.

00:52.804 --> 00:53.888
Bye.

01:42.145 --> 01:43.563
(DOOR OPENS)

01:45.565 --> 01:47.066
- What did you forget?
- Nothing.

01:47.192 --> 01:48.359
Then why'd you come back?

01:48.485 --> 01:49.944
'Cause I live here.

01:50.069 --> 01:51.696
Come on, Samantha,
you're gonna be late for school.

01:51.821 --> 01:54.240
What are you talking about?
It's 4:30.

02:04.959 --> 02:06.669
Are you okay?

02:06.795 --> 02:07.754
Lull

02:11.966 --> 02:13.384
Tired, I guess.

02:26.147 --> 02:27.774
SAMANTHA: What's wrong?

02:31.694 --> 02:32.654
I don't know.

03:08.189 --> 03:09.315
CUDDY: Right.

03:09.440 --> 03:13.820
That's all I need to know.
You're late! Okay, bye.

03:15.280 --> 03:17.782
37-year-old male
with recurring blackouts.

03:17.907 --> 03:20.535
Tell him to switch from tequila
to bourbon. Worked for me.

03:20.660 --> 03:23.997
The three doctors he's already seen
already ruled out drugs and alcohol.

03:24.122 --> 03:25.081
Then it's epilepsy.

03:25.206 --> 03:26.207
Tell him to buy
a hockey helmet and...

03:26.332 --> 03:28.501
EEG's clean, so is the CT.

03:30.003 --> 03:33.256
Relax. Just because you got approved
by an adoption agency

03:33.381 --> 03:35.174
doesn't mean you'll get approved
by the birth mother.

03:35.300 --> 03:36.467
You're a single mom.

03:36.593 --> 03:40.221
That puts you somewhere below
couples acquitted in day care scandals.

03:40.346 --> 03:41.931
You're welcome,
Dr. House.

03:42.056 --> 03:43.808
It is an interesting case.

03:45.059 --> 03:46.811
What time are you
seeing the mom?

03:48.146 --> 03:50.481
Are you having
your guy follow me?

03:50.607 --> 03:52.650
I just trashed your
social value as a mother,

03:52.775 --> 03:54.527
and all I got
was a little sarcasm.

03:54.652 --> 03:56.571
It means you don't feel
the need to defend yourself,

03:56.696 --> 03:59.574
which means you're not worried
about getting a kid,

03:59.699 --> 04:01.951
which means
you've already got one.

04:02.076 --> 04:04.370
We're meeting at 11 :00.

04:04.495 --> 04:06.581
She's due to deliver
a baby girl in two weeks.

04:06.706 --> 04:10.001
Well, I'm sure the mom will be thrilled
to hand her crack baby off to a doctor.

04:10.126 --> 04:11.210
She's not a crack baby.

04:11.336 --> 04:12.921
No, mother's
perfectly healthy.

04:13.046 --> 04:14.380
She just had to give up
the baby in order

04:14.505 --> 04:17.592
to continue her work
on the human genome.

04:17.717 --> 04:19.802
She confessed
to some past meth use.

04:20.887 --> 04:24.390
What they don't confess to
is almost always more interesting.

04:24.515 --> 04:25.558
This is a mistake.

04:25.683 --> 04:28.645
Because a kid you don't know may have
some problems you don't know about

04:28.770 --> 04:30.229
that she may have
passed on to a kid...

04:30.355 --> 04:32.482
Because you're
a control-seeking narcissist,

04:32.607 --> 04:34.484
which is fine,
good even, in some jobs,

04:34.609 --> 04:38.071
but you're not equipped to handle
a real kid, never mind a factory second.

04:38.905 --> 04:41.157
Where are you meeting her?

04:41.282 --> 04:42.951
In a little place
called, "Follow me,

04:43.076 --> 04:45.745
"and your urologist
will be buying himself a new yacht."

04:45.870 --> 04:47.705
They explained
the returns policy, right?

04:47.830 --> 04:48.831
It's worse than video games.

04:48.957 --> 04:50.249
I'm not changing my mind.

04:54.128 --> 04:55.922
THIRTEEN: Could be
post-concussion syndrome.

04:56.047 --> 04:57.882
Not without a pre-concussion.

04:58.007 --> 04:59.133
HOUSE: Pick a number.

04:59.258 --> 05:00.259
For what?

05:00.385 --> 05:02.136
Cuddy pool. She got the nod.

05:02.261 --> 05:03.763
Little tweaker's due
in fourteen days.

05:03.888 --> 05:06.015
That's great news. I think.

05:06.140 --> 05:07.100
HOUSE: It's good news.

05:07.225 --> 05:10.186
The great news is she insisted
that she's not gonna change her mind,

05:10.311 --> 05:12.313
which means she's actually
thought about changing her mind,

05:12.438 --> 05:14.357
which means she's not sure
she's ready to be a mom,

05:14.482 --> 05:15.984
which means
she's not ready to be a mom,

05:16.109 --> 05:17.652
which means
she's gonna change her mind.

05:17.777 --> 05:19.153
The only question is when.

05:19.278 --> 05:21.990
$100 buy-in, less than seven means
the next seven days.

05:22.115 --> 05:24.325
But she's been dying for a kid
for three years.

05:24.450 --> 05:25.618
No way she's gonna
back out now.

05:25.743 --> 05:27.120
Not one of the options.

05:30.748 --> 05:33.167
Mini strokes can cause
blackouts and memory loss.

05:33.292 --> 05:35.837
Nine hours is a lot of time
to be out for a mini stroke.

05:35.962 --> 05:37.672
And there'd be
residual damage on the CT.

05:37.797 --> 05:40.049
THIRTEEN: The guy works at home
as a consumer product tester.

05:40.174 --> 05:42.802
He could've been exposed to a toxin
that caused short-term memory loss.

05:42.927 --> 05:43.928
Wouldn't show up on imaging.

05:44.053 --> 05:47.807
A cavernous sinus thrombosis could cause
absence seizures and memory loss.

05:47.932 --> 05:49.517
I'll take seven to fourteen.

05:49.642 --> 05:50.685
We have a player.

05:50.810 --> 05:51.894
You just said
it was great news.

05:52.020 --> 05:53.062
Now you want
to bet against her?

05:53.187 --> 05:55.148
It's only great news
if she wants it to be great news.

05:55.273 --> 05:57.025
House knows her better
than any of us.

05:57.150 --> 05:59.193
I'd rather use a pseudonym.

05:59.318 --> 06:00.987
Good thinking.

06:02.071 --> 06:04.198
I say she's gonna
meet the mom and bolt.

06:04.323 --> 06:06.868
I'm going for the early fold.

06:08.036 --> 06:12.999
Check his home for toxins,
and his sinuses for thrombosises.

06:14.751 --> 06:16.377
Maybe he OD'd on caffeine.

06:16.502 --> 06:19.380
Apparently he didn't drink the coffee,
just smelled it.

06:21.924 --> 06:22.884
Wow.

06:25.887 --> 06:27.722
Did they just move here?

06:27.847 --> 06:29.015
(SIGHING) Six years ago.

06:29.140 --> 06:30.767
This is no way
to raise a kid.

06:30.892 --> 06:33.019
He's a single dad.
I'm sure he's doing his best.

06:33.144 --> 06:34.145
(SIGHS)

06:34.270 --> 06:37.065
Which is why single people
shouldn't have kids.

06:37.190 --> 06:38.775
You got a problem
with what Cuddy's doing?

06:38.900 --> 06:39.984
You think
single mothers can't...

06:40.109 --> 06:42.862
I think the traditional family
is a fraud.

06:42.987 --> 06:44.906
Even married moms
are single moms.

06:45.031 --> 06:48.242
Daddy just pays some bills
and reads just enough bedtime stories

06:48.367 --> 06:49.702
to not kill himself
out of guilt.

06:49.827 --> 06:50.828
My dad was great.

06:50.953 --> 06:53.414
- After my mom died, he...
- He might be the exception.

06:53.539 --> 06:56.542
On the other hand,
you are fairly screwed up.

07:04.592 --> 07:06.844
No booze,
no meds, no drugs.

07:06.969 --> 07:07.929
TAUB: And no view.

07:08.054 --> 07:10.848
The building's half empty. He'd rather
a view of the turnpike than the park.

07:10.973 --> 07:12.391
Park views
are probably 50% more.

07:12.517 --> 07:15.061
You're surprised the guy's a pragmatist
after looking at this place?

07:15.186 --> 07:17.438
The guy's not a pragmatist,
he's a flagellant.

07:17.563 --> 07:18.648
Mmm.

07:18.773 --> 07:20.566
Looks like mold.

07:32.620 --> 07:33.955
Mom would have
cleaned better.

07:36.791 --> 07:40.002
THIRTEEN: Exposure to certain types of
mold can cause short-term memory loss.

07:40.128 --> 07:41.504
We're testing both of you.

07:41.629 --> 07:43.256
I feel fine.

07:43.381 --> 07:45.675
I'm sure you are.
We're just being cautious.

07:46.592 --> 07:49.637
So, where do you guys go,
other than home and school?

07:49.762 --> 07:52.223
Nowhere. Dad works at home,
and I go to school.

07:52.348 --> 07:55.017
What about sports,
friends, travel?

07:55.143 --> 07:57.728
Like I said, Dad works at home,
and I go to school.

08:01.315 --> 08:03.484
Must be hard not having
your mom around, huh?

08:03.609 --> 08:06.195
I was only four
when the accident happened.

08:06.863 --> 08:09.782
Still, I'm sure you
both miss her sometimes.

08:09.907 --> 08:11.492
Not really.

08:15.413 --> 08:16.956
- You're strong.
- No, I just don't get

08:17.081 --> 08:19.333
what the big deal
about death is, you know?

08:21.586 --> 08:22.962
Yeah.

08:25.756 --> 08:26.841
How is she?

08:28.176 --> 08:31.804
Physically, she's fine.
Mentally, she's weird.

08:31.929 --> 08:35.683
I'm sure she's just freaked out
about her dad. Mr. Harmon?

08:37.852 --> 08:39.353
Mr. Harmon?

08:39.478 --> 08:40.563
Where are you going?

08:40.688 --> 08:41.939
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)

08:43.816 --> 08:45.776
I have an appointment.
I have to go.

08:45.902 --> 08:47.486
We haven't finished
with your treatment,

08:47.612 --> 08:48.821
and we're still waiting
on some test results.

08:48.946 --> 08:49.864
I have an appointment.

08:49.989 --> 08:51.115
I'm sorry, you're gonna
have to reschedule.

08:51.240 --> 08:52.825
I really have to go.

08:55.203 --> 08:56.412
Mr. Harmon,
do you know where you are?

08:56.537 --> 08:58.247
Why are you
trying to stop me?

09:00.791 --> 09:03.336
Look at his eyes.

09:03.461 --> 09:05.046
THIRTEEN:
Is he having a seizure?

09:05.171 --> 09:09.467
His pupils are responsive.
I think he's asleep.

09:15.514 --> 09:18.100
TAUB: He was just asleep.
It means no memory loss.

09:18.226 --> 09:20.519
And sleepwalking doesn't kill,
unless he walks out a window.

09:20.645 --> 09:22.939
Sleepwalking's not a diagnosis,
it's a symptom.

09:23.064 --> 09:24.398
As long as we can't
figure out why...

09:24.523 --> 09:26.567
Stress-induced insomnia.
Lots of people sleepwalk.

09:26.692 --> 09:29.320
Not in the middle of the day before
they've even put their head on a pillow.

09:29.445 --> 09:30.571
Could be some
sort of narcolepsy.

09:30.696 --> 09:32.698
HOUSE: Which is caused by...

09:32.823 --> 09:34.408
There's usually
a genetic history.

09:34.533 --> 09:35.785
HOUSE: Or?

09:35.910 --> 09:38.829
If you know the answer,
can you tell us the answer?

09:38.955 --> 09:42.333
I don't know the answer.
Which brings us back to "Or?"

09:42.458 --> 09:44.710
Some sort of
environmental trigger.

09:44.835 --> 09:46.212
- Which means?
- It's a toxin.

09:46.337 --> 09:47.338
So we are?

09:47.463 --> 09:49.090
Being led down
an annoying path.

09:49.215 --> 09:52.551
I honestly don't know where
this is going. Just following the clues.

09:52.677 --> 09:53.761
TAUB: We're right back
where we started.

09:53.886 --> 09:56.013
The mold we found
doesn't cause these symptoms,

09:56.138 --> 09:58.391
and there's nothing else
at his home.

09:58.516 --> 10:00.351
- And?
- And you're obnoxious.

10:00.476 --> 10:01.686
He never goes
anywhere else.

10:01.811 --> 10:02.979
Which we know because?

10:03.104 --> 10:04.355
Because he says so.

10:04.480 --> 10:07.316
Because his daughter says so.
Because they have no reason to lie.

10:07.441 --> 10:10.695
Which proves he never goes
anywhere else

10:11.529 --> 10:13.030
when

10:14.115 --> 10:15.491
he's...

10:19.912 --> 10:21.247
Conscious.

10:21.372 --> 10:22.999
Oh, my God,
you're right.

10:23.124 --> 10:24.208
He said he had
an appointment.

10:24.333 --> 10:25.710
HOUSE: Next time,
let him keep it.

10:25.835 --> 10:28.963
Send him home,
see where his dreams take him.

10:49.275 --> 10:51.193
Becca?

10:51.319 --> 10:52.194
Dr. Cuddy?

10:52.320 --> 10:53.863
Lisa. Nice to meet you.

10:54.989 --> 10:56.699
- Oh! You want one?
- No, thanks.

10:56.824 --> 10:59.952
I can't stop eating them.
I guess it's, like, a craving.

11:00.077 --> 11:02.830
I must have,
like, a dozen a day.

11:02.955 --> 11:05.249
And this is decaf.

11:06.125 --> 11:07.001
How have you been feeling?

11:07.126 --> 11:10.921
Uh... You know,
tired, fat, nervous.

11:12.048 --> 11:14.925
Is there anything
you want to ask me?

11:15.051 --> 11:18.054
Yeah, actually,
I just have one question.

11:19.513 --> 11:21.932
What are you
going to call her?

11:22.058 --> 11:23.559
I'm not sure.

11:23.684 --> 11:25.436
It's all been rather sudden,
you know?

11:25.561 --> 11:26.854
I like Joy.

11:28.606 --> 11:31.650
But as I said,
I haven't really decided yet.

11:31.776 --> 11:32.985
(SIGHS)

11:33.152 --> 11:34.904
Well, is there anything
you want to ask me?

11:35.029 --> 11:36.489
It's okay.

11:38.574 --> 11:41.994
The agency website is filled
with prospective parents.

11:42.119 --> 11:43.704
There are their photos,
their biographies.

11:43.829 --> 11:46.082
There're so many
wonderful people out there.

11:46.207 --> 11:47.625
Wonderful couples.

11:48.542 --> 11:50.795
Why did I choose
a single mom?

11:50.920 --> 11:55.633
My grandmother was married for 37 years
to a man that treated her like garbage,

11:55.758 --> 11:58.219
and my mom would've stayed married
to my loser dad that long,

11:58.344 --> 11:59.678
but he dumped her.

11:59.804 --> 12:00.930
You know, I never understood

12:01.055 --> 12:03.682
how you could fall for the same crap
as your mother.

12:03.808 --> 12:05.601
Then I met Tony.

12:07.144 --> 12:10.898
When I read your bio,
a doctor, a head of a hospital.

12:11.023 --> 12:13.109
When I saw
your picture...

12:15.277 --> 12:18.155
I don't want her
raised by a loser.

12:25.871 --> 12:28.207
How long have you had
that rash?

12:28.332 --> 12:30.126
I don't know,
a few days.

12:30.251 --> 12:31.585
Have you had
any joint pain?

12:31.710 --> 12:34.004
Yeah, I'm pregnant.
All my joints hurt.

12:34.130 --> 12:36.006
They shouldn't all hurt.

12:36.132 --> 12:36.966
Have you been using?

12:37.091 --> 12:38.300
Not in seven months.

12:38.426 --> 12:40.845
Not since I found out
I was pregnant.

12:43.013 --> 12:45.266
That needs
to be checked out.

12:52.731 --> 12:55.276
You sure
you don't want children?

12:55.401 --> 12:58.946
You know, just because we're stuck here,
and I'm lying down,

12:59.071 --> 13:00.865
doesn't mean
we need to get deep.

13:00.990 --> 13:03.576
You're afraid you'll make the same
mistake you made with your wife?

13:03.701 --> 13:06.704
Get caught taking some other kid
to a ball game?

13:06.829 --> 13:08.414
I like my life as it is.

13:12.168 --> 13:14.003
No, nothing.
He just got up.

13:14.128 --> 13:16.922
Maybe it's a result
of a blood pressure change.

Out of nowhere.

13:20.634 --> 13:23.345
He's now asleep.

13:24.013 --> 13:25.764
Brain's supposed
to turn off motor function.

13:25.890 --> 13:27.641
If the brain was doing
what it was supposed to be doing,

13:27.766 --> 13:30.311
we wouldn't be here.
He's leaving. Come on.

13:32.605 --> 13:35.232
CAMERON: She's 38 weeks.
You think it's Fifth disease?

13:35.357 --> 13:36.817
- What's that?
- It's a viral infection.

13:36.942 --> 13:37.943
It can infect the fetus.

13:38.068 --> 13:39.778
Usually in the first
20 weeks of pregnancy,

13:39.904 --> 13:41.697
and in women who have trouble
with their immune system.

13:41.822 --> 13:44.241
History of drug use could have
compromised her immune system.

13:44.366 --> 13:46.827
I told you I haven't used anything
in seven months.

13:46.952 --> 13:48.662
It does look more
like a heat rash to me.

13:48.787 --> 13:52.958
Yes, well, maybe we want to look
at the actual blood tests.

13:53.542 --> 13:54.960
Of course.

13:55.753 --> 13:58.214
- Does she work for you?
- Yeah.

13:58.881 --> 14:01.008
Everybody here
works for you?

14:02.635 --> 14:05.346
When this happens for real,
are you okay to deliver here?

14:05.471 --> 14:07.348
- Yeah, sure.
- Good.

14:08.432 --> 14:10.643
Blood work's normal.

14:10.768 --> 14:11.894
Test it again.

14:12.019 --> 14:13.729
Tested it twice.

I'll get you some topical cream
for that rash.

14:16.023 --> 14:18.275
I'm admitting her.

14:19.360 --> 14:20.444
There's nothing
wrong with her.

14:20.569 --> 14:22.655
There are dozens of other things
this rash could indicate.

It's impressive that you didn't wait
for the actual crying and nagging.

14:36.210 --> 14:39.088
She had a lace-patterned rash,
joint pain and a history of drug abuse.

exactly the same thing.

14:52.935 --> 14:55.187
You leave me
no choice but to change.

14:55.312 --> 14:56.689
My clothes, not my mind.

14:56.814 --> 14:57.982
That's exactly my point.

14:58.107 --> 14:59.108
It's not gonna be
me and a cup.

14:59.233 --> 15:00.317

gonna ask you to baby-sit.

15:14.290 --> 15:15.708
We should stop him.

15:15.833 --> 15:16.667
THIRTEEN:
The whole point was to...

15:16.792 --> 15:18.502
Let him plow into
some innocent bystander?

15:18.627 --> 15:21.589
His legs are working.
Obviously his eyes are working, too.

could be slower.

15:23.215 --> 15:24.049

15:24.174 --> 15:25.593
Yeah, I see.

15:26.885 --> 15:28.637
He's having sleep sex.

15:28.762 --> 15:29.805
Maybe.

15:29.930 --> 15:32.016
- Pull up to her.
- I know.

15:41.066 --> 15:42.109
What'd that guy want?

15:42.234 --> 15:43.694
Piss off.

15:43.819 --> 15:45.362
Go after him.
She's not a hooker.

15:45.487 --> 15:46.447
How do you know?

15:46.572 --> 15:47.865
THIRTEEN: Do you want me
to describe the clues,

15:47.990 --> 15:51.660
or do you want to stop him before he
finishes off the drugs he just bought?

16:05.132 --> 16:07.009
Apparently,
Rip's a coke fiend.

16:14.767 --> 16:18.562
So, Sleeping Beauty
has a jones for Snow White.

16:18.687 --> 16:21.732
Coke explains the narcolepsy,
narcolepsy explains the sleepwalking.

16:21.857 --> 16:24.360
But it doesn't explain the rip
in the space-time continuum.

16:24.485 --> 16:27.404
Coke leads to sleepwalking,
which leads to coke,

16:27.529 --> 16:28.697
which leads to sleepwalking.

16:28.822 --> 16:30.199
What caused
the first sleepwalking?

16:30.324 --> 16:31.909
The coke he took
while he was wide awake.

16:32.034 --> 16:33.327
- He says he didn't.
- Wouldn't be the first time

16:33.452 --> 16:34.703
somebody lied about drug use.

16:34.828 --> 16:35.913

He has no reason to lie.

his job doesn't drug test,

16:38.332 --> 16:40.084
no relationship,
his daughter wouldn't find out.

16:40.209 --> 16:41.543
Maybe he just forgot.

16:42.711 --> 16:46.674
Forgot he did cocaine?
You're going with forgot over lying?

16:46.799 --> 16:48.300
It fits.

16:48.425 --> 16:52.388
Cocaine explains the narcolepsy,
narcolepsy explains the sleepwalking.

16:52.513 --> 16:55.557
Whatever's in the cocaine other than
the cocaine explains the memory loss.

16:55.683 --> 16:57.518
Dealers cut that stuff
with all kinds of garbage.

16:57.643 --> 17:00.187
Great. We'll start him on immediate
treatment for "all kinds of garbage."

17:00.312 --> 17:01.730
You can narrow it down
in the lab.

17:01.855 --> 17:02.690
Not without a sample.

17:02.815 --> 17:04.191
So get a sample.

17:04.316 --> 17:07.277
You want us to score cocaine
from a drug dealer?

17:07.403 --> 17:08.445
It's exciting.

17:08.570 --> 17:09.530
It's a felony.

17:09.655 --> 17:11.115
It's necessary.

17:15.119 --> 17:18.914
There she is.
Amniotic fluid looks good.

17:19.039 --> 17:21.875
Good fetal movement,
heart's beating nicely.

17:28.173 --> 17:31.051
- What?
- It looks like pulmonary hypoplasia.

17:31.176 --> 17:32.344
What's that?

17:32.469 --> 17:34.179
The baby's lungs
are underdeveloped.

17:34.304 --> 17:35.639
She won't be able
to breathe on her own.

17:35.764 --> 17:37.391
- She might die?
- I don't know.

17:37.516 --> 17:39.184
If she was born today,
she'd be in trouble,

17:39.309 --> 17:40.811
but we're not going
to let that happen.

17:40.936 --> 17:42.646
We'll put you on magnesium
to prevent labor,

17:42.771 --> 17:44.440
and steroids
to grow the lungs.

17:44.565 --> 17:47.109
It's a good thing
Dr. Cuddy brought you in.

17:50.904 --> 17:52.698
How do you know what
a drug dealer looks like?

17:52.823 --> 17:54.575
I'm not doing drugs,
if that's what you're asking.

17:54.700 --> 17:57.286
I just noticed that she had cash
in her hand. Obviously came from him.

17:57.411 --> 17:59.621
Obviously didn't have enough time
to perform any other services.

17:59.747 --> 18:00.748
I didn't notice
her holding any...

18:00.873 --> 18:02.416
Mmm. There she is.

18:07.671 --> 18:08.964
TAUB: We're not cops.

18:09.089 --> 18:10.174
Cops aren't allowed to say that,
right?

18:10.299 --> 18:11.550
Yeah, they can say it.

18:11.675 --> 18:12.509
Oh!

18:12.634 --> 18:16.221
But if you were a cop, you'd know that.
What do you want?

18:18.766 --> 18:20.184
I'd like to buy some cocaine,
please.

18:20.309 --> 18:23.228
(LAUGHS)
Definitely not a cop.

18:30.569 --> 18:32.321
Thank you.

18:32.446 --> 18:33.405
Wait.

18:41.038 --> 18:43.081
- It's good.
- Glad you like it. Now can we go?

18:43.207 --> 18:45.626
No.
You gave us the wrong stuff.

18:45.751 --> 18:47.085
What are you talking about?
You got my best.

18:47.211 --> 18:49.755
I know. I don't want the good,
"get the new customer hooked" stuff.

18:49.880 --> 18:52.800
I want the stepped-on, "keep the old
customer coming back for more" stuff.

18:52.925 --> 18:54.051
Are you crazy, bitch?

18:54.176 --> 18:56.053
No, I'm just a bitch
who knows what she wants.

is really working out for you.

19:05.145 --> 19:07.314
All of the shopping,
none of the stretch marks.

19:07.439 --> 19:08.732
Not a good time.

19:08.857 --> 19:10.651
Right.
Kid's getting worse.

19:10.776 --> 19:14.238
Blessing in disguise,
although completely predictable.

19:14.363 --> 19:17.157
If you take in strays,
don't be surprised by the worms.

19:17.282 --> 19:18.367
I'm still wearing
the sweater.

19:18.492 --> 19:21.203
I didn't say you weren't stubborn,
I said you weren't maternal.

19:21.328 --> 19:23.497
Thank you.
Go away.

19:23.622 --> 19:25.666
- You're getting crankier.
- Baby's sick.

19:25.791 --> 19:27.626
Sorry I'm not
finding the fun in that.

19:27.751 --> 19:31.839
Is it really worth it? Just for
the pursuit of unconditional love?

19:33.382 --> 19:35.175
Only you could see
that as a bad thing.

19:35.300 --> 19:36.510
It's a fake thing.

19:36.635 --> 19:39.304
There's no unconditional love,
it's just unconditional need.

19:39.429 --> 19:42.307
Don't make this child a victim
of your biological clock.

19:42.432 --> 19:43.725
Victim?

19:44.768 --> 19:46.395
You think
she's better off staying...

19:46.520 --> 19:47.688
Yes.

19:47.813 --> 19:50.774
'Cause at least she knows
she's not qualified for the job.

19:56.989 --> 20:00.617
Let me guess. I'm gonna tell her
not to play ball in the house,

20:00.742 --> 20:02.578
- but she's not gonna listen.
- No.

20:02.703 --> 20:06.248
Actually, I was going for she sneaks
her boyfriend in while you're sleeping,

20:06.373 --> 20:07.583
and he wants
to do it on the desk,

20:07.708 --> 20:11.461
and at first she says no,
but she has issues with self-esteem...

20:11.587 --> 20:12.462
You know you're
gonna pay for that.

20:12.588 --> 20:15.257
I'm paying for it
right now with wisdom.

20:28.937 --> 20:32.232
We found lactose.
The coke was cut with milk powder.

20:32.357 --> 20:33.483
Makes it nutritious.

20:33.609 --> 20:34.985
Not much of a toxin.

20:35.110 --> 20:36.653
It is
if he's allergic to milk.

20:36.778 --> 20:37.946
TAUB: He's not.
There's milk in his fridge.

20:38.071 --> 20:39.406

his coffee?

20:42.868 --> 20:45.370
Cocoa something. Why?
What does it matter?

20:45.495 --> 20:47.372
He likes his coffee black.
Milk's for the kid.

20:47.497 --> 20:48.332
How can you be sure?

20:48.457 --> 20:51.501
Because if he drank the milk,
he'd know that he's lactose intolerant.

20:51.627 --> 20:53.670
Ask him, then treat him
for allergic reaction.

23:09.765 --> 23:11.558
See, this is what's
screwed up here.

23:11.683 --> 23:13.101
You're not sure
that this is the right call,

23:13.226 --> 23:15.353
but you are sure that this is
what you want to tell her.

23:15.479 --> 23:18.398
And that scares you
because your motives aren't medical.

23:19.274 --> 23:21.610
Some part of you
doesn't want this baby,

23:21.735 --> 23:23.695
and that part wants
to tell her to kill it.

23:26.239 --> 23:28.283
This is an impossible situation.

23:28.408 --> 23:31.161
I'm advising her
to take the safest route.

23:31.286 --> 23:32.704
Right.

23:33.747 --> 23:35.874
Doesn't explain why
you changed your sweater.

23:46.093 --> 23:47.636
(DOOR OPENS)

23:51.640 --> 23:53.433
I need your advice.

23:54.267 --> 23:56.394
It's not cancer.

23:56.520 --> 23:59.815
Wow! Can you remove spleens
with your mind, too?

23:59.940 --> 24:02.776
You're here to talk about Cuddy.
The file is a pretext.

24:02.901 --> 24:05.445
Why the hell haven't you come
to talk to me about Cuddy?

24:05.570 --> 24:07.572
I've been doing
all sorts of insane stuff.

24:07.697 --> 24:10.700
If she can't handle your insanity,
she can't handle a baby.

24:10.826 --> 24:11.743
That's exactly my point.

24:11.868 --> 24:12.953
No, it isn't.

24:13.078 --> 24:15.580
You're feeling threatened
because she's going on to high school

24:15.705 --> 24:17.666
and leaving you behind
to repeat the 8th grade.

24:17.791 --> 24:20.502
She's sleeping with her math teacher
to get her diploma.

24:20.627 --> 24:22.796
Adoption is cheating?
Are they giving her a fake kid?

24:22.921 --> 24:24.464
That's the problem.

24:24.589 --> 24:25.841
She gets to have
a relationship with a kid,

24:25.966 --> 24:28.176
but she can't handle
one with an adult.

24:28.301 --> 24:30.053
So she's gonna kill it.

24:30.178 --> 24:31.805
That does seem cleaner.

24:33.056 --> 24:35.892
I've seen the file.
She's making a judgment call.

24:36.017 --> 24:37.894
Decisions are never made
in a vacuum.

24:38.019 --> 24:41.106
Just like your decision
to make her miserable.

24:41.231 --> 24:43.483
You're doing this because
we no longer have inkwells,

24:43.608 --> 24:45.694
and Cuddy doesn't
have pigtails.

24:50.532 --> 24:52.242
Why do you think
I did that?

24:59.082 --> 25:00.876
How you doing?

25:01.376 --> 25:02.669
Not sure.

25:02.794 --> 25:04.963
Been keeping an eye on the clock,
like you said.

25:05.088 --> 25:06.423
I don't think
I lost any time.

25:06.548 --> 25:07.841
The machinery agrees with you.

25:07.966 --> 25:10.510
That means your problems
were caused by the coke.

25:10.635 --> 25:11.928
Can't believe I did coke.

25:12.053 --> 25:13.138
You were asleep.

25:13.263 --> 25:15.307
I chose to do coke.

25:15.432 --> 25:17.350
In your sleep.
You weren't responsible.

25:17.475 --> 25:19.519
Something inside me
wanted to do it.

25:19.644 --> 25:21.730
Something inside of me
didn't think it was wrong.

25:21.855 --> 25:23.148
It's like a dream.

25:23.273 --> 25:25.650
We all do stuff in our dreams
we wouldn't do when we're awake.

25:25.775 --> 25:27.110
I don't.

25:31.948 --> 25:33.658
What's that?

25:39.080 --> 25:41.333
Did I fall asleep
and hurt myself?

25:42.667 --> 25:43.585
I don't see any cuts.

25:43.710 --> 25:45.253
'Cause there aren't any.

25:45.378 --> 25:46.796
I think

25:47.714 --> 25:49.799
you're sweating blood.

25:52.802 --> 25:57.390
The guy is bleeding out of his pores.
What does that tell us?

25:57.515 --> 26:01.269
Other than you don't want to play
basketball against him, and he's dying.

26:01.394 --> 26:03.188
FOREMAN: That neither cocaine
or allergies are the answer.

26:03.313 --> 26:05.273
KUTNER: It's gotta be systemic.
Hemorrhagic virus maybe?

26:05.398 --> 26:06.608
THIRTEEN:
You think it's Ebola?

26:06.733 --> 26:09.527
His white blood cell count would be
through the roof. It's not an infection.

26:09.653 --> 26:11.905
- DIC?
- Coags are normal.

26:12.030 --> 26:14.783
It's cancer.
Leukemia explains everything.

26:14.908 --> 26:16.243
KUTNER: No fever.
TAUB: The bleeding.

26:16.368 --> 26:17.369
KUTNER: No weight loss.
TAUB: The rash.

26:17.494 --> 26:18.828
- No headaches.
- The fatigue.

26:18.954 --> 26:20.622
Leukemia would be obvious
from the CBC.

26:20.747 --> 26:23.041
Leukemia has false negatives
all the time.

26:27.254 --> 26:30.882
So, we have four reasons for leukemia,
four reasons against.

26:31.007 --> 26:32.259
You only need one against.

26:32.384 --> 26:37.055
Yeah, if we had one reason for anything
else. Go do a bone marrow biopsy.

26:43.853 --> 26:45.897
What would you do?

26:48.692 --> 26:50.026
I think...

26:51.027 --> 26:53.071
I think you should wait.

26:53.196 --> 26:57.158
But if I wait,
I could die.

26:57.284 --> 26:59.703
There would be more danger
for you, but...

26:59.828 --> 27:02.539
Is this your opinion
as a doctor,

27:02.664 --> 27:04.374
as a mother?

27:04.499 --> 27:06.126
It's my medical opinion.

27:07.252 --> 27:08.628
It's my personal opinion.
I don't...

27:08.753 --> 27:10.630
I don't wanna wait.

27:12.674 --> 27:16.678
It might only be one week.
We will keep you on plasma.

27:16.803 --> 27:19.848
This is not my baby.

27:19.973 --> 27:24.978
I already sacrificed nine months
for this stupid mistake.

27:26.938 --> 27:30.066
I don't wanna
sacrifice any more.

27:31.443 --> 27:36.072
Becca, you asked my opinion because
you wanted to do the right thing.

27:36.197 --> 27:39.951
You are giving up this baby because
you don't want to make the mistakes

27:40.076 --> 27:42.787
your mom made,
her mom made.

27:42.912 --> 27:48.168
You have a chance to break this cycle,
to do something great for this baby.

27:53.590 --> 27:54.799
No.

28:03.016 --> 28:03.933
(EXHALES)

28:04.059 --> 28:06.227
I need you
to hold still.

28:08.688 --> 28:09.981
Wait.

28:12.025 --> 28:16.071
You been testing
any tanning creams or sprays?

28:16.196 --> 28:17.238
No.

28:18.698 --> 28:21.826
It's not a tan.
Means it's not leukemia.

28:22.702 --> 28:24.037
(GRUNTS)

28:29.042 --> 28:31.211
KUTNER: Chem panel
confirms kidney failure, end stage.

28:31.336 --> 28:32.420
Got him on dialysis?

28:32.545 --> 28:33.922
BP's too low.

28:34.047 --> 28:37.717
Too bad. Would have been nice to have
more than an hour to solve this thing.

28:37.842 --> 28:38.843
Haemachromatosis?

28:38.968 --> 28:41.346
- He have tiny testes?
- No. Scleroderma.

28:41.471 --> 28:43.723
His skin's darker,
not lighter.

28:43.848 --> 28:46.101
As much fun as 20 Questions
tends to be,

28:46.226 --> 28:48.353
he's blowing blood
out of every orifice.

28:48.478 --> 28:49.729
You think it just
might be vascular?

28:49.854 --> 28:51.439
Vasculitis?

28:51.564 --> 28:55.819
If I said it might be vitas gerular,
would you have said Vitas Gerulaitis?

28:55.944 --> 28:58.446
Test him for vasculitis.
Angio and blood.

28:58.571 --> 29:01.699
Even if we're right,
he's going to need a kidney transplant.

29:01.825 --> 29:03.493
- Test the daughter.
- She's 12.

29:03.618 --> 29:05.870
Small kidney?
It just means he won't pee as much.

29:05.995 --> 29:07.038
Great for road trips.

29:07.163 --> 29:08.415
I meant she's a minor,

29:08.540 --> 29:11.584
and Daddy has a conflict,
so we're gonna need Cuddy's sign-off.

29:11.709 --> 29:12.544
So get it.

29:12.669 --> 29:15.004
She's kind of busy.

29:19.801 --> 29:21.094
CHASE: Clamp.

29:29.185 --> 29:30.812
Suction.

29:32.814 --> 29:34.899
Entering the abdominal cavity.

29:36.818 --> 29:38.778
There's the head.

29:43.491 --> 29:45.410
HOUSE: Got a minute?

29:45.869 --> 29:47.787
- Get out of here.
- Who's that?

29:47.912 --> 29:49.164
CHASE: Dr. Gregory House.

29:49.289 --> 29:51.541
He's the one you'll be suing
when you develop sepsis.

29:51.666 --> 29:52.625
Well, why is he here?

29:52.750 --> 29:54.544
Better question is,
why is she here?

29:54.669 --> 29:56.629
You're an administrator,
administrate.

29:56.754 --> 29:58.423
My patient's daughter
needs a guardian ad litem.

29:58.548 --> 29:59.757
CHASE: That's it.
HOUSE: Tests are inconclusive,

29:59.883 --> 30:01.759
- but either way, he's gonna need...
- House, get out!

30:01.885 --> 30:03.386
This doesn't need you,
I do.

30:03.511 --> 30:04.679
Head's out.

30:07.098 --> 30:09.309
- Later.
- Later's too late.

30:12.353 --> 30:14.939
CHASE: And there she is.

30:17.609 --> 30:19.027
CUDDY: Come on, cry.

30:20.904 --> 30:22.322
There we go.

30:24.449 --> 30:25.617
Come on.

30:28.786 --> 30:33.082
Come on. Joy, cry!

30:33.958 --> 30:35.418
Cry,

30:35.543 --> 30:37.003
I'm sorry.

30:37.712 --> 30:39.672
I'm so sorry.

30:42.175 --> 30:43.760
(BABY CRYING)

30:43.885 --> 30:46.846
CHASE: That's a sound
we like to hear.

30:46.971 --> 30:48.765
Apgar's 9 out of 10.

30:49.474 --> 30:51.142
You hear that?

30:51.976 --> 30:54.103
You just got
your first A.

30:54.854 --> 30:56.689
(CUDDY CHUCKLING)

31:00.151 --> 31:03.112
She's yours now.

31:14.999 --> 31:16.626
Mazel tov.

31:16.751 --> 31:18.503
Now it's time to say those magic words

31:18.628 --> 31:20.588
you'll be telling her
for the rest of her life,

31:20.713 --> 31:22.966
"Mommy's gotta go to work."

31:27.887 --> 31:30.223
CUDDY: Have the risks of the transplant
procedure been explained to you?

31:30.348 --> 31:33.184
Damn it! I was hoping
you weren't going to ask her that.

31:33.309 --> 31:35.603
Of course she knows.
Can you just sign the paperwork?

31:35.728 --> 31:40.316
Dr. House explained to you that all
surgeries carry risks? You could die.

31:40.441 --> 31:42.151
And if you don't do it,
Daddy will die.

31:42.277 --> 31:43.528
CUDDY:
Stop pressuring her.

31:43.653 --> 31:45.697
Sorry.
Daddy's perfectly healthy.

31:45.822 --> 31:47.282
But we want you to give him
the kidney anyway,

31:47.407 --> 31:49.701
'cause it'd be cool
if he had three.

31:50.368 --> 31:52.120
Shut up.

31:53.913 --> 31:56.916
Do you understand the risks
of living with one kidney?

31:57.041 --> 31:57.875
Yeah.

31:58.001 --> 31:59.877
And you still want to proceed
with the transplant?

32:00.003 --> 32:00.878
Yeah.

32:05.466 --> 32:07.427
Okay. Go ahead.

32:12.974 --> 32:14.684
No.

32:14.809 --> 32:16.477
I'm saying
you can proceed.

32:16.603 --> 32:17.937
And I'm saying I can't.

32:21.899 --> 32:24.944
Whatever he has,
she has, too.

32:25.945 --> 32:28.031
She's sleepwalking.

32:32.910 --> 32:35.121
KUTNER: If we don't give him
a new kidney, he's dead in a week.

32:35.246 --> 32:36.581
We have to transplant.

32:36.706 --> 32:38.583
When your remote
has a dead battery,

32:38.708 --> 32:41.753
you don't replace it
with another dead battery.

32:41.878 --> 32:43.713
Whatever's killing
the dad's kidneys

32:43.838 --> 32:45.006
is going to kill
the kid's, too.

32:45.131 --> 32:48.092
It is possible the sleep issues
aren't medically related.

32:48.217 --> 32:51.095
Maybe they're both insomniacs
due to the turnpike noise,

32:51.220 --> 32:53.139
maybe they both drink
too much coffee, maybe...

32:53.264 --> 32:54.474
House is right.

32:54.599 --> 32:55.433
How do you know?

32:55.558 --> 32:57.852
Because the daughter
is sweating blood.

32:57.977 --> 33:00.229
But if they have the same thing,
it means there has to be a common cause,

33:00.355 --> 33:02.982
which means it has to be a toxin,
infection or genetic.

33:03.107 --> 33:05.443
And since we've ruled out
infections and toxins...

33:05.568 --> 33:08.321
It narrows it down to any one
of a dozen genetic disorders,

33:08.446 --> 33:10.698
each of which takes
more than a week to run.

33:11.574 --> 33:13.618
Call Foreman,
get to work.

33:17.830 --> 33:20.416
<i>WILSON:
Cuddy is positively aglow.</i>

33:20.541 --> 33:24.003
What's your theory, she's only
acting happy to make you miserable?

33:24.128 --> 33:26.172
I need a genetic disease.

33:26.297 --> 33:27.757
I'm sure
you're carrying a few.

33:27.882 --> 33:31.719
Symptoms are kidney failure,
bleeding and insomnia.

33:31.844 --> 33:33.388
You paid off the pool?

33:33.513 --> 33:36.182
Technically,
anyone who didn't enter is a winner.

33:36.307 --> 33:37.517
It's not over yet.

33:37.642 --> 33:39.727
Everyone's happy
until they unwrap that pretty present

33:39.852 --> 33:41.896
and find they got a wall clock
in the shape of Africa.

33:42.021 --> 33:44.148
Adoption's a cheat,
remember?

33:44.273 --> 33:47.735
There's no real pregnancy, so
there's no stranded dopamine receptors,

33:47.860 --> 33:50.405
so there's no
post-partum depression.

33:50.530 --> 33:53.491
Cuddy will be the happiest
new mother you've ever seen.

33:55.785 --> 33:58.579
I've just given you
the answer, haven't I?

33:59.789 --> 34:03.126
And now you're going to walk out of here
without saying a word.

34:04.544 --> 34:05.628
Nope.

34:09.257 --> 34:12.260
Good news.
I know what you have,

34:12.385 --> 34:14.345
and you're both
gonna be fine.

34:15.722 --> 34:17.432
What?
Are you serious?

34:17.557 --> 34:19.892
Yes, and no.

34:20.017 --> 34:21.394
So you do know
what they have?

34:21.519 --> 34:22.562
Yeah.

34:22.687 --> 34:24.480
FOREMAN: But they
aren't going to be fine.

34:24.605 --> 34:26.816
No idea.
They might be.

Why the hell
would you say they were?

HOUSE: Technically,
to see if they can be happy.

34:34.574 --> 34:38.703
I should have seen a grin,
a twinkle, a sigh of relief, something.

34:38.828 --> 34:40.288
They're sick,
they're tired.

34:40.413 --> 34:41.581
They're anhedonic.

34:41.706 --> 34:43.374
Incapable of
experiencing pleasure.

34:43.499 --> 34:45.376
Something's bushwhacked
their dopamine receptors.

34:45.501 --> 34:48.337
They're depressed.
Mom's dead, Dad's dying.

34:48.463 --> 34:51.716
You should know that being bummed
isn't necessarily a pathology.

34:51.841 --> 34:54.552
Being bummed doesn't explain
their lack of friends,

34:54.677 --> 34:56.220
or their indifference
to each other.

34:56.345 --> 34:59.307
Why their place had no music,
no view, no decor.

34:59.432 --> 35:01.225
But if you can't feel pleasure,
what's with the cocaine?

35:01.350 --> 35:04.854
Really? Is that why you do drugs?
'Cause you're happy?

35:04.979 --> 35:06.981
Most people do them
'cause they wanna be happy.

35:07.106 --> 35:09.025
His subconscious
craved it, needed it.

35:09.150 --> 35:11.402
The most common cause of anhedonia
is schizophrenia.

35:11.527 --> 35:12.653
Sure, in white folk.

35:12.779 --> 35:14.238
They're black?

35:16.824 --> 35:18.993
They're liars.

35:21.162 --> 35:23.206
What's your name?

35:23.331 --> 35:24.832
Jerry Harmon.

35:25.833 --> 35:31.839
Your real name.
Hosarian? Herzog? H'Ali-Baba?

35:33.090 --> 35:34.509
Hammoud.

35:38.846 --> 35:40.306
Jamal Hammoud.

35:40.431 --> 35:44.185
Changed it when we invaded Iraq,
the first time.

35:44.310 --> 35:46.479
How did you know?

35:46.604 --> 35:49.857
You and your daughter have
Familial Mediterranean Fever.

35:49.982 --> 35:53.444
It's a genetic disease contracted
by people of Mediterranean descent.

35:53.569 --> 35:56.364
Sephardic Jews,
Armenians, Arabs.

35:56.489 --> 36:00.743
Causes anhedonia, seizures, kidney
failure, even lactose intolerance.

36:00.868 --> 36:03.162
Symptoms are set off
by age and stress.

36:03.287 --> 36:06.541
Kid couldn't get happy, but she could
get stressed by Daddy dying.

36:06.666 --> 36:08.042
You don't know
if we'll get better?

36:08.167 --> 36:12.964
Treatment tends to be hit and miss,
once you reach the sweating blood stage.

36:13.089 --> 36:16.217
Start them on colchicine
and melphalan.

36:16.342 --> 36:18.553
His kidneys
are fried.

36:18.678 --> 36:21.222
If he doesn't have FMF,
the colchicine will kill him.

36:21.347 --> 36:23.057
Boy, I sure hope
I'm right.

37:08.185 --> 37:09.770
Mr. Harmon?

37:11.063 --> 37:13.858
Mr. Harmon,
I need you to open your eyes.

37:17.236 --> 37:18.779
Feeling better?

37:31.792 --> 37:33.878
How's Samantha?

37:34.003 --> 37:35.963
Healthy enough
to toss you a kidney.

37:38.341 --> 37:40.092
- Dad?
- Sammy.

37:40.217 --> 37:41.302
(CHUCKLES)

37:41.427 --> 37:43.137
(LAUGHS)

38:00.821 --> 38:02.156
Baby's doing great.

38:03.699 --> 38:05.201
Lull

38:05.701 --> 38:08.579
I can't imagine
how hard this must be for you.

38:08.704 --> 38:12.458
I was stupid
and selfish.

38:12.583 --> 38:15.878
- You were scared.
- Yeah. But you wouldn't have been.

38:16.754 --> 38:17.588
That's not true.

38:17.713 --> 38:20.758
Well, I mean,
you would have been scared,

38:20.883 --> 38:24.136
but you would have done
the right thing anyway.

38:25.388 --> 38:27.890
And I wanna be like that.

38:29.934 --> 38:33.980
I don't wanna be a loser.

38:34.105 --> 38:35.982
You're not a loser.

38:37.942 --> 38:42.029
When I saw you hold her,
and the look on your face,

38:42.154 --> 38:46.033
it was the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

38:48.577 --> 38:52.081
And that's when
I realized

38:53.332 --> 38:54.959
I can't...

39:00.965 --> 39:02.091
Becca.

39:03.718 --> 39:08.597
My life, it's always been
about pain and anger and disappointment,

39:08.723 --> 39:10.725
never about love.

39:10.850 --> 39:14.520
And that's when I realized,
you know, it could be.

39:14.645 --> 39:16.939
And I can't give that away.

39:18.649 --> 39:20.860
Becca, don't do this.

39:26.866 --> 39:28.659
(EXCLAIMS)

39:30.828 --> 39:32.913
What you're feeling
is natural,

39:33.039 --> 39:38.419
but you're filled with hormones
and emotion and fear.

39:39.879 --> 39:41.881
And you just can't make a huge decision
like this right now,

39:42.006 --> 39:44.175
you have to give it
some time.

39:44.300 --> 39:48.137
I'm so sorry.

39:52.641 --> 39:55.019
It's a decision
that changes everything.

39:58.314 --> 40:00.024
Changes the rest
of your life.

40:02.485 --> 40:04.862
I hope so.

41:04.755 --> 41:06.674
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

41:15.349 --> 41:18.227
It's really not the greatest time
for gloating.

41:24.984 --> 41:27.611
There's more than one baby
in the sea.

41:27.736 --> 41:31.699
The world is full of teenage boys
riding bareback.

41:31.824 --> 41:33.409
No.

41:34.076 --> 41:37.997
I'm done.
I can't go through that again.

41:38.122 --> 41:39.999
You're quitting?

41:40.124 --> 41:41.333
Just like you quit NF?

41:41.458 --> 41:43.419
Yeah. Just like that.

41:43.544 --> 41:45.337
There, you just did it again.

41:50.634 --> 41:52.469
It's too bad.

41:53.554 --> 41:56.182
You would have made
a great mother.

42:01.270 --> 42:03.105
You son of a bitch.

42:03.230 --> 42:06.609
When I was getting a baby,
you told me I'd suck as a mother.

42:06.734 --> 42:10.905
Now that I've lost it,
you tell me I'd be great as a mother.

42:11.030 --> 42:14.783
Why do you need
to negate everything?

42:18.996 --> 42:20.873
I don't know.

42:48.859 --> 42:50.819
Good night.

42:55.449 --> 42:57.326
Good night.
