03:18.600 --> 03:22.484
Grant us, Lord, the wisdom
and the grace to use right...

03:22.600 --> 03:26.398
the time that is left to us
here on Earth.

03:26.515 --> 03:30.530
Lead us to repent of our sins,
the evil we have done...

03:30.690 --> 03:33.517
and the good we have not done.

03:33.617 --> 03:37.140
And strengthen us to follow
the steps of Your son...

03:37.302 --> 03:41.577
in the way that leads to
the fullness of eternal life.

03:41.737 --> 03:45.185
For Jesus Christ, Our Lord,
Amen.

03:45.650 --> 03:46.650
Amen.

04:06.875 --> 04:08.475
Bastard!

04:09.920 --> 04:12.585
Still owes me for a lobster.

04:19.357 --> 04:22.849
It's like that David Bowie film:
"The Man Who Fell to Earth".

04:22.968 --> 04:26.881
No, it's not! Trevethyn jumped
off a plane without a parachute.

04:26.981 --> 04:29.982
- In the film, Bowie was an alien.
- "Is" an alien.

04:30.100 --> 04:32.406
Don't start with that bollocks.

04:32.506 --> 04:35.940
There are many people in
show biz that are from off-world.

04:36.058 --> 04:38.680
Have you ever looked
into David Bowie's eyes?

04:39.232 --> 04:42.420
By that same token, you could
say that Charlie was an alien.

04:42.537 --> 04:44.137
Exactly!

04:45.104 --> 04:48.031
- Charlie, more wine?
- Thanks, Grace.

04:48.974 --> 04:51.901
- House looks lovely!
- Oh, thank you.

04:52.236 --> 04:54.599
- Maurice?
- Yeah, thank you.

04:55.933 --> 04:58.903
- Thank you, Grace.
- Thank you, Grace.

05:02.631 --> 05:06.067
- Tongue. Sausage rolls in the kitchen.
- Thank you.

05:06.167 --> 05:08.211
- Wash your hands.
- Okay.

05:10.155 --> 05:12.125
Grace, who are you looking for?

05:12.242 --> 05:14.517
Matthew, there you are!

05:15.025 --> 05:19.345
Would you check the humidifier in
the greenhouse? I completely forgot.

05:20.028 --> 05:23.259
It's done! I did it yesterday
when you asked me.

05:24.072 --> 05:26.649
Don't know what I'd do without him.

05:30.247 --> 05:34.088
What kind of injuries would someone
have if they fell from that height?

05:34.292 --> 05:37.858
- Very bad ones.
- Why did he do it?

05:37.958 --> 05:39.925
We don't really know.

05:40.025 --> 05:44.090
Maybe he thought he was going to the
bathroom and picked the wrong door.

05:44.470 --> 05:48.006
Yes, very likely.
Would you excuse me?

05:49.905 --> 05:53.050
- I'm gonna get you!
- No, you're not! You can't catch me!

05:54.037 --> 05:55.037
Matt.

05:56.211 --> 05:58.356
- Have you got any?
- No. There's none about.

05:58.516 --> 06:00.116
Matthew.

06:01.213 --> 06:03.663
- Alright, come on.
- Good.

06:10.607 --> 06:12.695
She's not here, Grace.

06:12.795 --> 06:17.665
- Who's not here?
- She left just after the service.

06:18.870 --> 06:21.492
- Did you talk to her?
- No.

06:29.830 --> 06:34.671
- Do you think she'll leave?
- She loves it here.

06:35.224 --> 06:39.803
Diana thinks it was an accident.
He was just looking for the lavatory.

06:40.919 --> 06:43.586
I imagine he went
on the way down.

06:44.921 --> 06:46.748
Is this the last of it?

06:46.848 --> 06:49.937
Enjoy. It's gonna be
a long cold winter.

06:50.271 --> 06:51.546
All right, Alfred?

06:51.663 --> 06:54.459
- Hi, Dr. Bamford!
- Hi, Matthew.

06:54.577 --> 06:57.534
I wonder if you could
do me a favor, doctor.

06:57.634 --> 07:00.731
My ear needs to be
looked at again. It's still...

07:00.831 --> 07:06.418
still giving me gyp. I'll pop
into the surgery tomorrow.

07:06.841 --> 07:09.855
Okay. Well, I'd better be off.

07:09.973 --> 07:14.291
There's reports of salmon
poachers out in the estuary.

07:17.714 --> 07:19.727
You alright?

07:21.498 --> 07:23.773
You have no idea.

07:33.153 --> 07:35.384
My mom wanted to get
one of those dishwashers.

07:35.501 --> 07:39.299
My dad said "no".
She's already got one. Him.

07:45.028 --> 07:48.463
If there's anything I can do,
Grace, you know, in the house...

07:48.563 --> 07:52.476
Well, everyone's been
very kind, but, really...

07:53.288 --> 07:55.086
- I'm fine.
- I'll do that.

07:55.203 --> 07:56.739
No, it's...

07:57.291 --> 07:58.608
Harvey!

07:59.161 --> 08:00.961
I'm fine.

08:01.553 --> 08:03.153
Right-o.

08:54.656 --> 08:56.844
- Morning, Matthew.
- Hi ya.

09:01.093 --> 09:03.281
- Hello, Joyce.
- Good morning, Grace.

09:10.442 --> 09:12.412
- Morning, Tom!
- Hello, Grace!

09:17.575 --> 09:19.677
Good morning, ladies.

09:26.361 --> 09:28.504
Morning, Grace.

09:29.318 --> 09:33.896
I'd like a package of paracetamol
and I'd like to settle my account.

09:34.231 --> 09:36.233
Oh, no... We've...

09:36.333 --> 09:38.755
Lost our accounts. Why don't
you pay us next month?

09:38.855 --> 09:40.769
- Lost the accounts?
- Yes.

09:40.887 --> 09:43.466
It's very mysterious.

09:44.148 --> 09:47.381
- I'll just take the paracetamol.
- Right so.

09:47.497 --> 09:49.424
How much is that?

09:49.846 --> 09:52.046
Five pence.

09:53.021 --> 09:54.948
No, it's Â£1,25 on the box.

09:55.108 --> 09:57.165
Special offer.

10:00.154 --> 10:01.993
Thank you.

10:02.893 --> 10:05.515
Right. Thank you.

10:05.677 --> 10:08.081
- Bye-bye now.
- Bye-bye.

10:41.209 --> 10:43.658
I can extend the overdraft...

10:43.862 --> 10:48.745
a bit. And maybe you can find out
if there's a life insurance policy.

10:48.907 --> 10:52.659
- Investments.
- I don't understand, it's a mistake.

10:53.124 --> 10:58.618
Your late husband used the house
as an asset to raise capital.

10:59.083 --> 11:01.750
As you have no children,
you'll inherit the estate...

11:01.867 --> 11:04.969
but you'll also inherit
the mortgage.

11:05.174 --> 11:09.056
Fine. The house's 300 years old.
The mortgage must be paid off by now.

11:09.304 --> 11:11.218
You don't understand.

11:11.318 --> 11:16.711
He used the house as collateral
for loans to finance business deals.

11:16.871 --> 11:20.277
None of which,
actually, took off.

11:20.393 --> 11:23.843
- What about the money he left me?
- There isn't any.

11:24.743 --> 11:28.497
And there are
the mortgage payments.

11:28.614 --> 11:31.890
- How much are they?
- Two thousand pounds a month.

12:07.103 --> 12:09.856
I'll be up your flu
in a minute or two

12:10.104 --> 12:12.423
Cause I know where to find it

12:12.540 --> 12:15.032
It's on your back
and it's called...

12:15.194 --> 12:17.207
Hey, how are you doing?

12:17.890 --> 12:21.077
Matthew, I've got some
bad news, I'm afraid.

12:21.195 --> 12:22.595
I know.

12:29.850 --> 12:32.820
- Have you tried plant food?
- I tried everything.

12:33.067 --> 12:35.090
They died on purpose.
I even talk to them.

12:35.190 --> 12:37.299
- What do you say?
- "Would you mind not dying?"

12:37.461 --> 12:39.417
You really are
a crap gardener, Matthew.

12:39.517 --> 12:41.953
What do I know about plants?
I'm from Glasgow!

12:42.114 --> 12:45.419
- I hate this. I really hate this.
- Will somebody else do it?

12:45.519 --> 12:49.044
- We're sea people.
- He's not. He's a doctor!

12:49.160 --> 12:52.435
I don't have a fabulous record when
it comes to keeping things alive.

12:52.595 --> 12:54.870
It's like the signs.

12:55.074 --> 12:56.739
What signs?

12:56.900 --> 12:58.741
Armageddon.

12:58.859 --> 13:02.786
Final conflict.
A man falls from the sky...

13:02.990 --> 13:05.612
you lose your job,
and all the plants are dying.

13:07.861 --> 13:10.179
I meant to do that.

13:11.297 --> 13:14.920
Do you have
a stock portfolio, perhaps?

13:15.081 --> 13:17.964
- What's that?
- I don't know.

13:18.210 --> 13:20.778
I just thought you might have one.

13:20.878 --> 13:25.487
No, there's nothing like that. It's
just bills and letters of credit.

13:26.475 --> 13:31.446
I don't understand. There are accounts
here of companies I haven't heard of.

13:33.086 --> 13:35.491
We've got a Swiss bank account.

13:35.652 --> 13:38.535
There's nothing in it,
but we do have one.

13:39.828 --> 13:44.407
I'm sure there's something
tucked away somewhere.

13:44.524 --> 13:47.146
That's what I thought, Gerald.

13:47.394 --> 13:50.669
But no. No, there's not.

13:51.439 --> 13:53.627
There's nothing!

13:55.180 --> 13:58.280
What in God's name
am I going to do?

14:25.622 --> 14:28.986
- Are you alright? You look peaky.
- I'm fine.

14:29.277 --> 14:33.290
- I've just a bad hangover.
- I can't remember if we drank much.

14:36.060 --> 14:38.366
God, you're really ill.
You never get hangovers...

14:38.466 --> 14:41.946
- I'll be fine once I get on the boat.
- You shouldn't go to work.

14:42.063 --> 14:44.424
I think you should
see the doctor.

14:45.977 --> 14:48.729
I can't see anyone
without an appointment.

14:50.413 --> 14:52.471
- Tea?
- Yes, please!

14:54.154 --> 14:57.458
Hey, what are you doing?
Get off! Get off of there!

14:57.558 --> 15:01.416
Given your recent troubles, we
rather thought you'd want to cancel.

15:01.516 --> 15:03.939
It's only a tea party.
We could have it anywhere.

15:04.039 --> 15:07.996
But we always have it here.
It's tradition.

15:08.200 --> 15:10.344
I've been working
on a new hybrid.

15:10.463 --> 15:13.694
"Phalanopsis pathopedilum."
It's beautiful!

15:14.899 --> 15:17.608
Alright, ladies.
Back to business.

15:17.725 --> 15:20.291
Do we invite Dr. Bamford...

15:20.391 --> 15:23.784
given his disgraceful
display last year?

15:24.337 --> 15:27.350
No! Come on, sir. Off the mower!

15:27.510 --> 15:30.611
- What's going on?
- Afternoon, Mrs. Trevethyn.

15:30.773 --> 15:32.742
Hello, Bob. Terry.

15:32.860 --> 15:35.396
- How's your mom's hip, Bob?
- Much better, thanks.

15:35.557 --> 15:38.527
- Good, good.
- They wanna take the lawn mower.

15:39.994 --> 15:44.919
It's the finance company.
There haven't been any payments.

15:47.256 --> 15:50.182
Well, you'd better take it, then.

15:57.563 --> 16:00.011
I'm really sorry.

16:19.397 --> 16:23.332
Matthew! Matthew,
you don't have to do this.

16:23.432 --> 16:26.802
It's alright! You paid me
till the end of the week.

16:27.573 --> 16:30.674
I don't believe he even lied
about the lawn mower.

16:32.704 --> 16:35.197
He lied about everything.

16:45.795 --> 16:49.665
- Can't you get a job?
- What could I do?

16:49.765 --> 16:51.679
You could...

16:52.578 --> 16:55.724
- Do you want a cup of tea?
- No, thank you.

16:56.451 --> 16:58.421
Matthew...

16:58.538 --> 17:02.117
I'm really sorry about your job.
- It's alright.

17:02.756 --> 17:05.161
You're gonna have to get a goat.

17:06.757 --> 17:10.206
- If there's anything else I can do.
- I was hoping you would say that.

17:10.889 --> 17:12.597
- Why?
- Grace...

17:12.716 --> 17:15.557
you are the best gardener
in the world.

17:16.196 --> 17:19.253
I've got some plants
that are really sick.

17:19.632 --> 17:22.558
- They desperately need help.
- Well, where are they?

17:25.328 --> 17:26.328
What?

17:49.640 --> 17:52.697
- Why are you whispering?
- I don't wanna wake up any squirrels.

17:52.814 --> 17:55.002
Just through here. Here!

17:55.163 --> 17:59.046
- Are these Gerald's plants?
- No, no. They're mine.

17:59.642 --> 18:02.223
I think I may have
over watered them.

18:05.384 --> 18:09.832
I'm not stupid, Matthew.
I know what this is.

18:10.950 --> 18:12.790
What is it?

18:12.908 --> 18:15.400
- Hemp.
- Is it?

18:16.648 --> 18:19.430
- Alright, it's hemp.
- They're not getting enough light.

18:19.530 --> 18:21.618
They're never going to grow
in the dark down here.

18:21.735 --> 18:25.794
- I didn't want anybody to see them.
- You wouldn't, would you?

18:26.694 --> 18:31.534
For these poor things to grow, they
need some decent soil and better light.

18:31.653 --> 18:33.970
Okay, thanks.

18:39.090 --> 18:43.015
Come on, let's take one back to the
greenhouse, see what we can do.

18:43.133 --> 18:45.591
You may not want to do that.

18:45.691 --> 18:49.236
I'm a gardener.
These are sick plants.

18:49.353 --> 18:50.953
Alright.

18:58.052 --> 19:00.891
- Look! There's Gerald!
- He won't see us. His eyes are bad.

19:01.009 --> 19:02.674
Quick! Quick!

19:02.923 --> 19:06.414
- Where have you been?
- It's brilliant, Nicky.

19:06.533 --> 19:08.676
- I've saved the plants.
- How?

19:08.794 --> 19:10.894
- I called in an expert.
- Who?

19:11.012 --> 19:13.677
The best gardener in the world.

19:13.795 --> 19:16.143
- Grace!
- Grace?

19:16.243 --> 19:20.332
It's fantastic! It's compensation
for laying me off. Isn't that nice?

19:20.536 --> 19:22.898
- I don't know.
- What do you mean, you don't know?

19:23.059 --> 19:26.842
Hasn't she got enough problems
without getting into drugs?

19:26.942 --> 19:30.684
- What are you talking about, drugs?
- You know what I'm talking about.

19:30.931 --> 19:34.901
They're still illegal.
She's very vulnerable just now.

19:36.107 --> 19:38.627
I hope you're not
taking advantage of her.

19:38.727 --> 19:41.076
I'm doing this for us!

19:41.455 --> 19:44.338
- Is this how you say "thanks"?
- No.

19:44.934 --> 19:47.731
I've got a much better way.

19:48.936 --> 19:51.502
Congratulations, Mr. Stuart.

19:51.602 --> 19:54.995
You are tonight's
lucky Scotsman.

20:21.598 --> 20:24.567
- Well, I either am or I'm not.
- No, no, you definitely are.

20:25.032 --> 20:27.091
Pregnant indeed.

20:27.991 --> 20:30.439
- Is that a good thing?
- Yes.

20:31.948 --> 20:34.006
Yes, it's brilliant.

20:34.645 --> 20:37.210
Any idea who the father is?

20:37.310 --> 20:41.443
I think I know. I saw some of the
chromosomes had little kilts on.

20:42.474 --> 20:44.053
Very funny.

20:44.518 --> 20:47.647
I do have some bad news, though.

20:47.747 --> 20:51.011
- What?
- There's a risk of ginger hair.

20:52.693 --> 20:56.795
- Piss off.
- How are all our plants doing?

20:57.869 --> 21:00.100
He's called in an expert.

21:01.044 --> 21:03.102
Sounds good.

21:03.393 --> 21:09.146
Don't mention the baby yet. I wanna
tell him when the time is right.

21:10.004 --> 21:12.625
What baby? Have a sweetie.

21:17.657 --> 21:21.106
- Will she live, doctor?
- I think so.

21:21.919 --> 21:25.630
- Where did these seeds come from?
- A guy in a pub in Bodmin.

21:26.574 --> 21:28.805
I mean what kind are they?

21:28.966 --> 21:31.414
They're "Indicasativa" hybrids.

21:31.531 --> 21:34.489
"Purple Haze" with "Early Pearl"
crossed with "Ruderalis".

21:34.589 --> 21:38.285
But anyway, they're designed to
grow in a very sunny climate.

21:38.403 --> 21:40.199
If you say so.

21:40.359 --> 21:43.460
Is it the bud the bit
you're after?

21:46.971 --> 21:47.971
Look.

21:52.885 --> 21:56.726
- What is it?
- That's the start of a new bud.

21:58.409 --> 22:01.205
You did that in 24 hours?

22:01.498 --> 22:03.857
- You're a witch.
- It's not me, really.

22:03.976 --> 22:06.467
It's just a question
of having enough light.

22:06.585 --> 22:09.555
No light, no buds. Simple.

22:12.544 --> 22:15.427
- Yes?
- Is it alright if I park there?

22:15.544 --> 22:16.826
- Yes.
- Dogs?

22:16.926 --> 22:20.124
- Dogs?
- Dogs. Do you have dogs?

22:20.372 --> 22:23.242
Postmen and surveyors.
Irresistible to our canine friends.

22:23.342 --> 22:25.517
- No, there's no dogs.
- Good.

22:25.982 --> 22:27.808
Yes, fabulous hall.

22:27.908 --> 22:31.474
- Can I help you?
- No, no. I'm fine on my own.

22:31.593 --> 22:35.346
- Tea is always nice.
- You've come to the wrong house.

22:35.463 --> 22:38.042
I'm sorry, Nigel Plimpton.

22:38.246 --> 22:40.956
Trevethyn? Liac House?

22:41.770 --> 22:45.132
Evaluation for Ramptons
redebts outstanding.

22:45.248 --> 22:48.045
It's a standard procedure before
a house is put up for auction.

22:48.163 --> 22:50.438
But the house is not for auction.

22:51.903 --> 22:54.395
I'm afraid it will be.

22:54.599 --> 22:56.439
Here, look.

22:56.773 --> 23:00.426
People in your position often
stop opening their mail...

23:00.526 --> 23:03.963
so I'm the first real proof
it's all happening.

23:05.038 --> 23:07.660
I'll beg you to leave, please.

23:07.778 --> 23:09.747
I'm sorry. I can't.

23:09.865 --> 23:14.400
- I really must do this.
- I'd like you to leave as well.

23:17.258 --> 23:19.881
Call the office to reschedule.

23:25.695 --> 23:27.144
Thank you.

23:29.261 --> 23:31.928
Ramptons is an enormous
investment trust.

23:32.089 --> 23:35.525
John's syndicate
took a huge tumble.

23:35.625 --> 23:38.540
I'd no idea he had
business interest in the city.

23:38.656 --> 23:40.627
Yes, but how much do I owe them?

23:40.744 --> 23:45.105
If you don't pay the money owing,
they can claim any or all...

23:45.397 --> 23:47.584
of your assets.

23:47.702 --> 23:50.890
This, of course,
would include...

23:51.007 --> 23:54.848
the house.
- How much do I owe them, Melvyn?

23:55.486 --> 23:57.848
300 thousand pounds.

23:58.835 --> 24:01.155
Approximately.

24:41.587 --> 24:43.187
Bastard!

25:35.864 --> 25:37.747
- Matthew?
- Yeah?

25:37.909 --> 25:40.227
You know that plant...

25:40.343 --> 25:42.836
I'm looking after for you?

25:43.650 --> 25:47.011
- How much is it worth?
- It hasn't died, has it?

25:47.129 --> 25:50.402
No, no, it's thriving! I just...

25:51.041 --> 25:53.100
wondered how much
you'd get for it.

25:54.435 --> 25:57.536
Ounce for ounce, the really good
stuff is worth more than gold.

26:00.784 --> 26:03.320
Greenhouse, now!

26:05.264 --> 26:08.409
Here's what I think: we take
cuttings from the mother plant...

26:08.570 --> 26:12.105
root them, grow them hydroponically
and go straight to budding.

26:12.221 --> 26:14.341
We could have the first harvest
in a matter of weeks.

26:14.484 --> 26:18.543
You could clear what you need in the
1st run and in the time you've got.

26:19.790 --> 26:22.456
You haven't given it
any thought, then.

26:23.096 --> 26:25.631
You can't tell anybody.

26:35.925 --> 26:39.592
He just started.
We've got at least an hour.

26:48.015 --> 26:50.378
- Sorry.
- You've done it all

26:51.235 --> 26:54.161
You've broken every code

26:55.714 --> 27:00.816
Hold the rebel to the floor

27:02.324 --> 27:07.947
You've spoiled the game
No matter what you say

27:09.195 --> 27:13.950
For only metal What a bore

27:14.068 --> 27:18.081
Be reasonable.
That piece is worth that alone!

27:18.459 --> 27:21.591
I'm being very fair, Mrs. T.
Very good price I'm giving you.

27:21.691 --> 27:25.258
- It's daylight robbery!
- What else do you got?

27:26.420 --> 27:32.220
Come and see me Make me smile

27:32.897 --> 27:35.044
Or do what you want

27:35.204 --> 27:37.404
Run on wild

27:41.423 --> 27:43.923
There's nothing left

27:44.023 --> 27:47.569
All gone and runaway

27:48.599 --> 27:52.569
Maybe you'll tarry For a while

27:53.121 --> 27:55.353
- Is it this blue one, Jack?
- That's right.

27:55.469 --> 28:00.268
It's just a test
A game for us to play

28:00.385 --> 28:02.138
Hi, Grace.

28:02.603 --> 28:05.878
- Hello, Nicky!
- I haven't seen you for days.

28:05.995 --> 28:08.575
- Are you okay?
- Yes! Busy.

28:09.780 --> 28:11.836
What are you doing?

28:12.041 --> 28:15.142
I'm building a fence.
Keep out the rabbits.

28:15.651 --> 28:17.315
With electrical wire?

28:17.955 --> 28:21.043
- It's an electric fence.
- Okay.

28:21.143 --> 28:24.362
Is Matt up at the house? I just
gotta see him about something.

28:24.479 --> 28:28.493
No, he's out. He's looking
for a transformer.

28:28.697 --> 28:30.799
For the electric fence.

28:32.003 --> 28:35.104
If you do see him, would you tell
him I'll meet him at the pub at 7?

28:35.309 --> 28:36.931
Yeah, right-o.

28:38.570 --> 28:40.628
- Bye!
- Bye!

28:51.225 --> 28:53.066
Good book, is it?

28:55.532 --> 28:57.937
Oh, Jackie Collins.

28:59.142 --> 29:03.156
I'm reading a Kafka at the
moment. Not very funny.

29:03.753 --> 29:07.766
Except the one about a bloke that
turns into a beetle. Really wacky.

29:08.970 --> 29:12.594
Wouldn't get anybody turning
into a beetle in a Jackie Collins.

29:13.103 --> 29:16.030
You might get someone
sleeping with a beetle.

29:17.799 --> 29:22.683
"He wrapped her up, in his
stick-like arms, all six of them..."

29:22.844 --> 29:26.598
tapping her sensuously
on the head...

29:26.715 --> 29:29.773
"with his wiggly wobbly aerials."

29:31.890 --> 29:35.991
That's it. If he comes in now,
tell him I left in a huff.

29:36.196 --> 29:37.731
- Alright, love.
- Good night.

29:37.849 --> 29:41.037
- Probably lying in your couch asleep.
- Yeah, you're right.

29:46.808 --> 29:48.008
Sorry.

29:54.115 --> 29:59.768
It gives me great pleasure to ask
Dame Reggae Spliff of Port Liac...

29:59.868 --> 30:02.478
to switch on this year's
illumination.

30:02.638 --> 30:05.174
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

30:11.728 --> 30:15.395
When I die
And they lay me to rest

30:15.556 --> 30:18.613
Gonna go to the place that's the best

30:19.557 --> 30:22.122
When they lay me down to die

30:22.222 --> 30:26.659
Going up to the spirit in the sky

30:26.907 --> 30:30.573
Going up to the spirit in the sky

30:32.734 --> 30:36.314
- Where are you?
- Here we are...

30:36.910 --> 30:41.967
I'm gonna go to a place that's best

30:52.262 --> 30:55.101
They were up at the house,
I swear it.

31:04.962 --> 31:07.162
I told you.

31:07.441 --> 31:10.542
- That's a lot of light.
- Let's call the police...

31:10.703 --> 31:12.541
and the RAF.
They'll wanna be included.

31:12.659 --> 31:17.225
Let's just go back into the pub.
I wanna discuss something with you.

31:17.325 --> 31:20.457
Are you out of your fucking mind?
We gotta save Grace!

31:20.575 --> 31:24.067
I know what's causing the lights.
Just get back into the pub.

31:26.403 --> 31:29.534
- Is it gonna blow?
- No, I don't think so.

31:29.634 --> 31:31.548
That's it.

31:34.884 --> 31:37.809
- Well, how do you know?
- I've seen it before in Amsterdam...

31:37.927 --> 31:41.116
years ago, when I was on a medical
study, studying something medical.

31:41.363 --> 31:44.378
- So that's her plan, then?
- From what Matt's been saying...

31:44.495 --> 31:48.204
and putting 2 and 2 together...
- It kinda warms the heart...

31:48.322 --> 31:51.802
Grace carrying on the local tradition
of complete contempt for the law.

31:51.902 --> 31:55.641
- Makes you proud.
- Did you try that stuff, doctor?

31:55.759 --> 31:58.817
Once, at university.
Didn't inhale.

31:59.021 --> 32:00.621
Evening.

32:01.153 --> 32:03.022
- Evening.
- All right?

32:03.122 --> 32:04.775
Drinking after hours, Charlie?

32:04.979 --> 32:06.950
Private party, sergeant.

32:07.111 --> 32:09.415
Lagaboollen. 16 year-old.

32:09.515 --> 32:14.038
Just a small one. Any of you noticed
those lights out towards Liac House?

32:14.199 --> 32:15.809
- No.
- No.

32:15.909 --> 32:18.257
- How's your ear?
- Any luck with those poachers?

32:18.374 --> 32:22.475
I'll get them, just a matter
of time. Crime never pays.

32:22.593 --> 32:25.172
- Certainly not.
- Certainly.

32:31.900 --> 32:33.956
- Where have you been?
- Nowhere.

32:34.118 --> 32:35.957
- What have you been up to?
- Nothing.

32:36.076 --> 32:38.654
Well, I'm glad we got that
cleared up.

32:38.903 --> 32:42.526
I was working up at the house.
I lost track of time. Sorry.

32:42.686 --> 32:45.513
I waited for ages in the pub.
Didn't Grace tell you?

32:45.613 --> 32:49.788
She did. I was really, really
busy. I'm really, really sorry.

32:50.602 --> 32:53.993
- I've got something to tell you.
- Good, me too. Sit.

32:54.093 --> 32:57.355
- Let me go first. It's really good.
- So is mine.

32:57.690 --> 32:59.791
Right, you go first.

33:00.344 --> 33:03.487
- No, you go first.
- Alright.

33:03.780 --> 33:07.402
I'm moving the plants up to Liac House.
They're gonna grow quickly.

33:07.562 --> 33:09.987
There's a special way of growing
them. It's called "hydroponics".

33:10.087 --> 33:13.187
Grace is a good gardener. We're
gonna get out of money problems.

33:13.304 --> 33:16.013
- "We"?
- Me and Grace. Simple and perfect.

33:16.174 --> 33:19.796
We sell it! And anything over what
she needs we split fifty-fifty.

33:19.914 --> 33:22.189
Look, it's extreme, but it's smart.

33:22.350 --> 33:24.755
I don't wanna leave here to get
work and this way I get to stay.

33:24.855 --> 33:26.712
- Until you go to jail.
- I won't go to jail!

33:26.829 --> 33:31.134
Smoking weed is one thing.
Large scale cultivation is another.

33:31.234 --> 33:33.367
I'm surprised at Grace.
It's really stupid.

33:33.527 --> 33:37.542
It's not stupid, it's smart. It'd
be different if it was your idea.

33:37.659 --> 33:42.368
Right. When you're being chased in
the cell by a thief with a stiffy...

33:42.529 --> 33:44.969
I'll be standing here thinking:
"Why couldn't it have been me?

33:44.972 --> 33:47.501
Why couldn't I have had
that brilliant idea?"

33:47.618 --> 33:50.381
You've been bleating on about how
sad you are about losing your job...

33:50.481 --> 33:52.677
and what's your solution? Crime!

33:52.793 --> 33:55.635
You get in deeper and you
drag Grace down with you.

33:55.839 --> 33:58.808
Matthew, you are such an idiot!

34:02.710 --> 34:05.245
What's your news then?

34:05.928 --> 34:08.071
Doesn't matter.

34:38.719 --> 34:40.561
- Hello?
- Hello, Mrs. Trevethyn?

34:41.026 --> 34:44.822
Quentin Rhodes here, from
Ramptons. It's about our surveyor.

34:45.026 --> 34:48.518
"Velly solly. Long rumba."

35:07.468 --> 35:09.916
Get both of those.

35:10.730 --> 35:13.265
So she sort of gets
through there, you see?

35:15.558 --> 35:16.758
Right!

35:21.907 --> 35:24.441
- Mrs. Trevethyn.
- Hello.

35:25.300 --> 35:28.574
- Have you met my friend Tony?
- Hello.

35:28.691 --> 35:31.357
My name is Tony.
I'm from Scandinavia.

35:32.301 --> 35:34.489
Congratulations!

35:34.606 --> 35:39.055
Tony, could you go and get one
of those giant bags of kitty litter?

35:41.913 --> 35:44.435
He doesn't talk much.

35:44.535 --> 35:46.534
Does he have to?

35:47.740 --> 35:51.754
Grace, have you read
any of my letters?

35:51.872 --> 35:55.190
I'm sorry, no. But I'm
working on a little plan.

35:55.308 --> 35:59.366
It's a bit soon to talk about it
now, but I don't want to jinx it.

35:59.527 --> 36:02.236
Grace, I can't do anymore
to hold them off.

36:02.398 --> 36:04.518
It's gone up to head office,
and they don't know you.

36:04.703 --> 36:09.194
All they see is a middle-aged woman
with huge debts and no income!

36:09.355 --> 36:13.152
- What are you going to do?
- I'm becoming a drugs dealer.

36:15.096 --> 36:18.241
Grace, I'm serious.

36:19.228 --> 36:21.765
Thank you, Tony.
You will phone me, won't you?

36:21.881 --> 36:23.938
- Yes, righty-o.
- Come on, Tony.

37:38.599 --> 37:40.918
Honey Chambers?

37:43.210 --> 37:47.658
44 Wilberforce Street,
London, South West Three.

37:48.516 --> 37:51.138
He had me post his letters.

37:53.169 --> 37:55.530
I never got any.

38:00.737 --> 38:02.837
Would you like a drink?

38:08.521 --> 38:13.274
- Do you have any children?
- No! I'm not very maternal.

38:13.435 --> 38:15.437
I couldn't have any.

38:15.537 --> 38:18.842
- No, I know.
- Gosh, you know a lot!

38:21.959 --> 38:24.844
Can I ask you another question?

38:26.092 --> 38:28.062
If you want.

38:28.397 --> 38:31.323
How did you cope with sex?

38:32.441 --> 38:34.933
- Sex?
- Sex.

38:37.922 --> 38:39.979
What a nightmare!

38:45.924 --> 38:48.185
It was exhausting!

38:48.285 --> 38:53.635
Oh, God, it was so frustrating!
Talk about flogging a dead horse!

39:00.450 --> 39:01.644
No.

39:03.277 --> 39:04.741
Not really.

39:05.682 --> 39:07.075
What did you do then?

39:07.973 --> 39:11.987
- We shouldn't be talking about that.
- Please, I'd like to know.

39:15.149 --> 39:16.149
I...

39:19.455 --> 39:23.905
- Ice cream.
- What? Pardon?

39:26.805 --> 39:32.166
Ice cream. I sucked it from
his fingertips. It drove him wild.

39:34.982 --> 39:39.300
I had to pretend to pass out to get
any rest at all. He was insatiable.

39:49.161 --> 39:52.565
I think he thought
you weren't interested.

39:52.987 --> 39:55.349
He was wrong.

39:59.685 --> 40:01.728
It's a beautiful house.

40:01.828 --> 40:06.265
Yes. I think I'd like you
to leave now.

40:07.513 --> 40:10.832
- He did love you.
- Don't patronize me.

40:12.950 --> 40:16.007
Look, if you ever want to talk...

40:16.124 --> 40:19.703
Yeah, I know the address.

40:43.524 --> 40:45.494
Matthew...

40:48.611 --> 40:51.148
Will you give me one?

40:53.266 --> 40:54.266
What?

40:55.061 --> 40:57.802
I want to know what it feels like.

40:59.180 --> 41:00.580
Please.

41:01.876 --> 41:03.476
Grace...

41:03.791 --> 41:08.240
If I'm growing it and selling it,
I should know the effect it has.

41:08.749 --> 41:12.805
- Oh, yeah! Of course you should.
- No, not here!

41:13.968 --> 41:16.503
Come on. Let's get it
over and done with.

41:22.057 --> 41:25.419
Calm down!
There's no one about, relax.

41:51.370 --> 41:53.906
I don't feel anything.

41:56.067 --> 41:58.067
Slow down.

42:03.982 --> 42:06.170
Is this addictive?

42:09.984 --> 42:12.345
It's not crack.

42:22.509 --> 42:24.567
Are you sure this works?

42:24.728 --> 42:26.328
Oh, yes.

42:41.906 --> 42:44.094
- What?
- Nothing.

42:45.517 --> 42:47.717
What? What?

42:53.040 --> 42:57.707
- What?
- It's you. You're Scottish!

43:05.653 --> 43:07.623
Thank you.

43:39.315 --> 43:41.806
God, I love it here.

43:41.924 --> 43:44.372
You're feeling any better?

43:48.534 --> 43:51.984
Still feeling a little bit dizzy.

43:52.318 --> 43:54.506
You're hungry?

43:54.623 --> 43:58.028
Oh, yes!
God, I haven't thought of that.

43:58.364 --> 44:00.725
I'm ravenous.

44:19.587 --> 44:22.514
What made you decide to do this?

44:22.631 --> 44:26.733
44 Wilberforce Street, SW3.

44:50.206 --> 44:52.393
Mrs. Trevethyn?
Please, don't put the phone down.

44:54.294 --> 44:57.916
- Please, don't put the phone down.
- Problem?

44:58.033 --> 45:02.700
I've been trying to get through
Mrs. Trevethyn for most of my life.

45:03.470 --> 45:05.570
Phone, letters...

45:06.078 --> 45:08.702
What is that woman
doing down there?

45:09.255 --> 45:12.015
I don't know what's wrong with her.
She's been really moody recently.

45:12.212 --> 45:14.965
- Maybe she just doesn't approve.
- Desperate times call for...

45:15.082 --> 45:20.793
desperate measures. We could go
to Glasgow but she didn't want it.

45:21.779 --> 45:23.793
My uncle Willie's got
a building site there.

45:23.954 --> 45:26.142
- What does he build?
- Houses.

45:26.258 --> 45:27.881
- Round there.
- What?

45:34.697 --> 45:38.307
I play a good game,
but not as good as you

45:38.407 --> 45:42.568
I can be a little cold
but you can be so cruel

45:42.668 --> 45:46.539
I'm not made of brick
I'm not made of stone

45:46.655 --> 45:50.888
- But I had you fooled
- Five, four, three...

45:51.049 --> 45:52.976
two, one...

46:00.660 --> 46:03.457
Now the damage is done

46:03.574 --> 46:07.545
There's blood in these veins
And I cry when in pain

46:07.664 --> 46:11.198
I'm only human on the inside

46:11.533 --> 46:15.635
And if looks could deceive
Make it hard to believe

46:15.795 --> 46:21.158
I'm only human on the inside

46:25.233 --> 46:29.365
I thought you'd come through
I thought he'd come clean

46:29.465 --> 46:33.119
You were the best thing
I should never have seen

46:33.280 --> 46:37.641
But you go to extremes
You pushed me too far

46:37.758 --> 46:42.121
Then you keep going
until you break my heart

46:43.064 --> 46:46.035
Yeah, you break my heart

46:46.152 --> 46:50.166
See, I bleed and I bruise
But what's it to you?

46:50.285 --> 46:53.212
I'm only human on the inside

46:57.460 --> 46:59.852
- What do you want?
- I brought lunch.

46:59.952 --> 47:02.475
Cornish pastries. I'm kidding.

47:10.680 --> 47:12.913
Fish. You brought me fish?

47:13.074 --> 47:15.696
I thought it 'd be a nice change.

47:17.249 --> 47:20.394
What are you doing here?
You never come on the boat.

47:20.945 --> 47:25.178
I was wondering what you looked
like. I go to bed when you get up.

47:25.339 --> 47:28.439
- It's the tides.
- It's not the tides.

47:28.948 --> 47:31.308
- I don't like what you're doing.
- I know.

47:31.470 --> 47:34.150
I don't wanna be in a relationship
with someone who's irresponsible.

47:34.163 --> 47:36.515
Yes, you do. I have been
irresponsible my whole life!

47:36.615 --> 47:39.051
- Well, it's time you changed.
- Why?

47:39.560 --> 47:41.734
You're getting old!

47:41.834 --> 47:44.573
I'm not getting old.
These are laugh lines.

47:44.952 --> 47:47.401
Nothing is that funny.

47:47.823 --> 47:50.402
I don't understand. I thought
you liked me the way I am.

47:50.606 --> 47:51.606
I do.

47:52.476 --> 47:55.577
But things change and
you have to change with them.

47:55.694 --> 47:58.926
Fish and chips. Fantastic!

48:02.045 --> 48:07.364
In a few minutes, Tim Buxton'll be
here with more fun in the afternoon.

48:07.480 --> 48:10.669
First, it's 12 o'clock.
Time for the news headline.

48:11.396 --> 48:15.018
Police are celebrating a major
victory in the war on drugs today.

48:15.222 --> 48:18.613
Two men and one woman were found
guilty at Bristol Crown Court...

48:18.713 --> 48:22.454
after police discovered marijuana
with an estimated street value...

48:22.572 --> 48:26.238
of half a million pounds hidden
in a barn on their family farm.

48:26.356 --> 48:30.153
Sentencing them to 15 year
jail sentences, the judge...

49:17.937 --> 49:20.950
- Hello!
- Yeah...

49:21.807 --> 49:24.516
- Are you alright?
- I'm fine.

49:24.808 --> 49:28.345
I just wondered. You didn't
come into the pub last night.

49:28.550 --> 49:30.953
I'm not drinking at the moment.

49:34.593 --> 49:36.694
Are you angry with me?

49:36.854 --> 49:40.304
No, I'm angry at Matthew.
It's his fault.

49:40.465 --> 49:42.304
It was my decision to do it.

49:43.378 --> 49:44.871
I'm trying to save my house.

49:45.336 --> 49:49.393
Everybody knows what you're doing.
Soon you'll have the police there.

49:49.511 --> 49:51.308
They'll never find out.

49:51.425 --> 49:54.831
Your greenhouse lights up like
a space ship. People aren't stupid.

49:54.948 --> 49:59.048
- Anyway, we're nearly done now.
- He could be in jail by tomorrow.

50:04.863 --> 50:07.573
Why aren't you drinking?

50:07.951 --> 50:10.660
I just don't feel like it.

50:13.301 --> 50:16.054
He doesn't know, does he?

50:23.171 --> 50:25.664
How can I help?

50:26.348 --> 50:28.927
Don't let him go to jail.

50:38.960 --> 50:42.758
Our mutant buds will soon
be ready, great one!

50:42.918 --> 50:45.887
We can release them
into the atmosphere...

50:46.004 --> 50:49.020
and take over the entire planet!

50:51.007 --> 50:54.544
Do you realize what we have
done here? This is fabulous!

50:54.660 --> 50:57.326
It's time for me to go to London
and get a dealer.

50:57.662 --> 51:00.458
No, you are not.
You're staying here, I'm going.

51:00.619 --> 51:03.067
- What?
- It's my decision.

51:04.316 --> 51:06.634
I don't think you realize
what you're dealing with here.

51:06.751 --> 51:10.373
You were in London 5 years ago
for the Chelsea Flower Show.

51:10.710 --> 51:12.809
You can't sell this stuff
to a florist.

51:12.927 --> 51:14.839
What's your master plan then?

51:14.939 --> 51:20.464
I'd go to Portobello Rd. Or Notting
Hill, find a dealer and sell it.

51:20.973 --> 51:23.073
- That's your plan? That's it?
- Yeah.

51:23.191 --> 51:26.292
- Rubbish.
- You've got nothing!

51:26.408 --> 51:31.250
A drug dealer take one look at you and
know there's something fishy going on.

51:31.412 --> 51:35.511
With all due respect, I'm the hip one.
You're more hip replacement.

51:36.804 --> 51:39.468
One more word, and I'm gonna
throw the whole lot into the sea.

51:39.630 --> 51:41.774
- You're not thinking this through.
- I mean it.

51:41.935 --> 51:44.253
You are not the boss of me.
We're partners!

51:44.371 --> 51:46.603
The checks bounced, remember?

51:47.849 --> 51:50.169
Women like cuddly toys,
don't they?

51:50.285 --> 51:54.822
They like to hug and squeeze them,
poke their eyes and rip their limbs.

51:58.158 --> 52:00.085
I avoid confrontation, I know it.

52:00.201 --> 52:03.258
But if you grew up in Glasgow
in the 70's, you'd do the same.

52:03.419 --> 52:06.564
All I want is an easy life. Grow
some vegetables, smoke a reefer...

52:06.725 --> 52:08.260
sing some carols
at Christmas time.

52:08.378 --> 52:12.523
One day, I'd like to be a dad and
raise a couple of calm children.

52:12.684 --> 52:16.699
That's it, I've fucking had enough.
I'm gone. No more Mr. Cuddly Toy...

52:16.816 --> 52:20.961
or whipping boy for Ganja Grace
and Cap. Nicky, the lobster queen.

52:21.078 --> 52:23.570
I'm fucking gone! I'm gone!
I'm fucking out of here!

52:23.687 --> 52:27.571
Before that, I'm gonna see both of them
and give them a piece of my mind.

52:29.863 --> 52:31.746
Are you done?

52:35.386 --> 52:36.746
Good shot.

54:05.064 --> 54:06.120
Get out!

54:07.717 --> 54:08.917
Moron!

54:23.896 --> 54:28.723
Can I show you something privately?
It's ever so nice.

54:28.823 --> 54:30.518
Come on, let's go.

54:39.422 --> 54:42.915
- Can I show you?
- I don't know who you are.

54:43.772 --> 54:46.003
I'm not interested...

54:47.208 --> 54:48.808
Come on.

54:49.512 --> 54:51.426
Come here!

54:51.526 --> 54:53.832
I've got something really tasty.

54:55.383 --> 54:58.406
Are you looking for something?
Know what I mean?

54:58.506 --> 55:00.572
Alright, love. Hop in.

55:01.646 --> 55:02.846
Hello!

55:03.342 --> 55:05.574
Excuse me. Yo!

55:51.139 --> 55:54.371
I love it here. It's so quiet.

55:54.488 --> 55:59.067
If you think this is quiet,
you should see Evensong.

55:59.968 --> 56:02.765
I wish I were
a Catholic sometimes.

56:02.882 --> 56:07.752
Incense, nice costumes...
A lot to be said for it, really.

56:07.852 --> 56:10.853
They have confession too.

56:21.060 --> 56:23.641
I've got some friends...

56:23.889 --> 56:27.085
and I think they're going
to get into a lot of trouble.

56:27.185 --> 56:29.859
And I don't know what to do.

56:29.977 --> 56:32.643
Don't suppose you can go
to the police?

56:33.282 --> 56:35.427
I thought not.

56:35.543 --> 56:38.340
If you have to commit crime...

56:38.457 --> 56:40.861
to get what you want...

56:41.067 --> 56:43.820
then you're not meant to have it.

56:44.024 --> 56:48.039
I don't know if I'm worried more
for them or worried for myself.

56:48.373 --> 56:52.736
If one has a problem that
seems to be unsolvable...

56:53.071 --> 56:57.651
than perhaps one shouldn't try
to solve it, one should accept it.

56:57.856 --> 57:01.608
- What do you mean?
- "God, grant me the serenity..."

57:01.769 --> 57:04.043
to accept the things
I cannot change...

57:04.248 --> 57:07.291
courage to change
the things I can...

57:07.391 --> 57:09.871
"and the wisdom
to know the difference."

57:11.903 --> 57:14.177
The wisdom is the hard part.

57:21.905 --> 57:25.744
I like Matthew.
He's a good soul...

57:26.950 --> 57:29.398
for a Scotsman.

57:40.432 --> 57:42.346
What on Earth did you think
you were doing?

57:42.446 --> 57:46.448
You can't hang around pubs this way.
You're bound to get into trouble.

57:46.565 --> 57:50.361
If you're trying to meet a man,
I know so much better places.

57:50.478 --> 57:53.276
I wasn't trying to meet a man!

57:55.567 --> 57:57.263
Keep walking.

57:57.363 --> 58:00.190
- Go on, you'll be arrested.
- We need to talk!

58:06.441 --> 58:08.722
- Have you seen Nicky?
- No. Where the hell have you been?

58:08.738 --> 58:11.115
Grace had to get Harvey
to watch the plants.

58:11.215 --> 58:13.107
- What?
- I took her to the station.

58:13.224 --> 58:15.630
- She's gone to London.
- Fuck!

58:18.487 --> 58:20.283
Where are we going?

58:21.052 --> 58:24.110
44 Wilberforce Street, SW3.

58:29.229 --> 58:35.288
Ask your Scottish friend to help.
He'd know better how to go about it.

58:35.449 --> 58:39.073
His girlfriend is pregnant.
He can't get into trouble.

58:40.754 --> 58:43.986
I just want you to ring
a dealer, that's all.

58:44.407 --> 58:48.682
- It's mad. You'll end up in jail.
- I'm not going to give up.

58:49.584 --> 58:52.119
Call a dealer.

58:55.107 --> 58:57.860
How do you know that I know one?

59:06.588 --> 59:10.863
On one condition: that you let me
lend you an outfit that's...

59:11.851 --> 59:13.651
not that.

59:40.120 --> 59:41.424
- Kelly?
- Sir?

59:41.524 --> 59:43.352
Give times of trains
to Cornwall tomorrow.

59:43.468 --> 59:45.047
Yes, sir.

59:45.557 --> 59:48.557
Draw, spliff...

59:49.689 --> 59:51.089
puff...

59:51.645 --> 59:54.311
- shit.
- Yes, thank you.

59:54.993 --> 59:57.529
Call it what you will...

59:57.647 --> 1:00:01.922
but, as my belief,
it is the door to enlightenment.

1:00:02.822 --> 1:00:07.793
- In your own time.
- And now, the acid test.

1:00:21.827 --> 1:00:23.027
Jesus!

1:00:28.481 --> 1:00:30.974
I'll give you 60 for it.

1:00:33.049 --> 1:00:36.324
- Don't be silly.
- 70?

1:00:37.484 --> 1:00:41.138
That's just a sample.
I've got 20 kilos.

1:00:41.238 --> 1:00:43.718
20 kilos, Grace!

1:00:44.877 --> 1:00:48.587
You've caught the wrong man.
I'm on a limited operation.

1:00:48.705 --> 1:00:54.272
- You're talking big leagues!
- Well, you just got promoted.

1:00:54.372 --> 1:00:56.446
I don't have that kind of money.

1:00:56.546 --> 1:00:59.156
Well, do you know
anybody who does?

1:01:00.013 --> 1:01:02.201
I've heard of someone.

1:01:03.535 --> 1:01:05.335
Call him.

1:01:05.550 --> 1:01:09.637
He's a bit heavy. He's not
like us. He's not...

1:01:09.797 --> 1:01:11.797
Laid back.

1:01:12.029 --> 1:01:13.829
Call him.

1:01:19.541 --> 1:01:22.293
- Come on, Honey!
- There she is.

1:01:22.411 --> 1:01:25.063
- You don't know who the guy is.
- I don't care who the guy is.

1:01:25.163 --> 1:01:27.830
He may be a drug dealer. You can't
wander into something like that.

1:01:27.935 --> 1:01:30.408
- Why have you got so bossy?
- You are so fucking insensitive!

1:01:30.508 --> 1:01:32.661
- That could be dangerous!
- They're getting away now!

1:01:32.762 --> 1:01:34.905
Follow them, you dozy quack!

1:02:19.515 --> 1:02:22.168
Just like a window display
at Harvey Nicks.

1:02:22.268 --> 1:02:24.443
There's a rave tonight.
We hold them here.

1:02:24.560 --> 1:02:27.704
- What's a rave?
- Grace!

1:02:35.216 --> 1:02:39.708
- What have you brought me, China?
- Two ladies and a fucking hippie.

1:02:40.608 --> 1:02:42.708
What do they want?

1:02:59.005 --> 1:03:01.453
"Touche! Sur la tete!"

1:03:07.834 --> 1:03:11.617
- You like to fish?
- Where I live, the fishing is wonderful.

1:03:11.717 --> 1:03:13.762
I hate it here.

1:03:14.140 --> 1:03:16.631
The fishing is terrible.

1:03:16.749 --> 1:03:18.806
I should visit you.

1:03:18.967 --> 1:03:20.938
Where do you live?

1:03:23.446 --> 1:03:25.764
What's your name?

1:03:26.361 --> 1:03:27.561
Grace.

1:03:28.622 --> 1:03:30.158
Perfect.

1:03:31.406 --> 1:03:32.606
Hello!

1:03:33.754 --> 1:03:34.954
Grace?

1:03:36.886 --> 1:03:39.247
Funny smell.

1:03:41.495 --> 1:03:43.204
Who's that?

1:03:43.801 --> 1:03:46.249
Harvey. Where's Grace?

1:03:46.366 --> 1:03:49.423
We've come to finalize the details
of the Women's Institute visit.

1:03:49.541 --> 1:03:53.382
Grace invited us to supper.
It was arranged ages ago!

1:03:53.674 --> 1:03:57.818
- You gotta get out.
- No, we have to speak to Grace.

1:03:58.240 --> 1:04:01.775
No, you have to leave.
It's the plants, you see?

1:04:01.937 --> 1:04:04.676
They're very delicate.
They're special orchids from Peru.

1:04:04.776 --> 1:04:06.807
These aren't orchids.

1:04:06.907 --> 1:04:10.170
- Aren't they?
- No! They look more like tea.

1:04:10.286 --> 1:04:14.330
Tea, what a good idea.
Let's go in the kitchen...

1:04:14.430 --> 1:04:17.441
and I'll make you a cup of tea.
- I was expecting supper.

1:04:17.541 --> 1:04:19.822
There's some ham left over,
I can knock you up a sandwich.

1:04:19.869 --> 1:04:21.659
What's that funny smell?

1:04:21.759 --> 1:04:25.174
It's probably the ham. It's been
left out a bit, but it's okay.

1:04:34.381 --> 1:04:36.524
Where did you get it?

1:04:36.816 --> 1:04:39.774
The people I represent wish
to remain anonymous.

1:04:39.874 --> 1:04:41.474
Oh, yes.

1:04:41.917 --> 1:04:45.615
The people I represent wish
to remain anonymous as well.

1:04:45.906 --> 1:04:48.660
Maybe they are the same people.

1:04:48.952 --> 1:04:52.399
Can I go now? I've got to pick up
my daughter at the flute practice.

1:04:55.603 --> 1:04:57.387
How much do you have?

1:04:57.487 --> 1:04:59.661
A lot. Are you buying?

1:05:00.606 --> 1:05:03.128
Why don't I just take it?

1:05:03.228 --> 1:05:05.577
You don't know where it is.

1:05:05.738 --> 1:05:08.346
I'm sure I can get you to tell me.

1:05:08.446 --> 1:05:13.753
What if I cut a few fingers one by
one until you change your mind?

1:05:16.568 --> 1:05:19.840
Nobody move! I'm the police!
The whole place is surrounded!

1:05:23.395 --> 1:05:25.365
- And you would be?
- Hello, everyone.

1:05:26.222 --> 1:05:29.279
Martin Bamford.
Are we too early for the rave?

1:05:29.484 --> 1:05:32.889
I can't wait.
I just love raving.

1:05:33.093 --> 1:05:36.935
- This has nothing to do with me.
- Shut up, beardy-weirdy.

1:05:37.096 --> 1:05:40.022
- Who's this guy?
- That's my doctor.

1:05:41.444 --> 1:05:43.109
This one?

1:05:43.227 --> 1:05:45.066
He's my gardener.

1:05:46.532 --> 1:05:50.503
- Nice. Expecting anyone else?
- No.

1:05:50.794 --> 1:05:53.242
Your cleaning lady, perhaps?

1:05:54.012 --> 1:05:56.101
- No, no one else.
- Very well...

1:05:56.201 --> 1:05:58.275
This is China,
he beats people up for me.

1:05:58.375 --> 1:06:00.898
- Shall l...
- No, please...

1:06:01.189 --> 1:06:04.899
Matthew, take Dr. Bamford and
Honey and wait for me outside.

1:06:05.581 --> 1:06:06.981
Please.

1:06:09.278 --> 1:06:10.678
Please.

1:06:18.847 --> 1:06:20.847
Excuse me.

1:06:24.152 --> 1:06:27.471
- Grace...
- Wait for me outside.

1:06:30.894 --> 1:06:33.038
Shall I go too?

1:06:48.637 --> 1:06:51.042
Sit down, please.

1:07:01.814 --> 1:07:05.208
All the people I deal with are...

1:07:05.308 --> 1:07:06.308
scum.

1:07:07.383 --> 1:07:11.222
I'm a little scummy myself.
You are not scum.

1:07:11.688 --> 1:07:15.137
- That worries me.
- I take exception to that.

1:07:15.255 --> 1:07:18.095
I come from a long line of scum.

1:07:18.342 --> 1:07:22.922
My late husband was the scummiest
man to walk the face of the Earth.

1:07:23.083 --> 1:07:26.444
- My apologies.
- Yes, let's get to it, shall we?

1:07:26.997 --> 1:07:29.314
Three and a half a kilo.

1:07:29.433 --> 1:07:32.838
20 kg in the first week
and then 10 kg two weeks later.

1:07:33.389 --> 1:07:36.273
After that, we can do
20 kg every four weeks.

1:07:38.262 --> 1:07:41.479
Three for a kilo. And no more deals
until I see the first batch.

1:07:41.579 --> 1:07:44.537
- Three and a quarter.
- Done.

1:07:45.829 --> 1:07:47.755
Thank you!

1:07:50.699 --> 1:07:52.974
You're welcome.

1:07:54.527 --> 1:07:57.322
Can I offer you a glass of wine?

1:08:00.833 --> 1:08:03.239
I can't believe
your friend fainted.

1:08:06.140 --> 1:08:09.588
Do I look like I would
cut someone's finger off?

1:08:14.141 --> 1:08:17.502
- Oh, yes.
- Thank you.

1:08:25.014 --> 1:08:28.449
- You're going to be alright?
- Never felt better, Honey.

1:08:28.549 --> 1:08:30.637
Now, headache pills
and straight to bed.

1:08:30.755 --> 1:08:33.290
- Don't go over any bumps.
- Good luck!

1:08:34.365 --> 1:08:36.465
Come on, boys.

1:08:40.409 --> 1:08:41.857
What do you think?

1:08:42.148 --> 1:08:43.988
I'm not sure.

1:08:45.194 --> 1:08:47.151
Follow them.

1:08:47.251 --> 1:08:49.644
What do I do with the hippie?

1:08:53.848 --> 1:08:55.644
Take him.

1:08:55.980 --> 1:09:01.256
My old lady is expecting me. We're
having "Dungeons and Dragons" night.

1:09:05.721 --> 1:09:07.865
It's the regional final.

1:09:08.027 --> 1:09:10.332
If that knife had slipped,
I'd be a dead man.

1:09:10.432 --> 1:09:13.115
It 'd be a dead body driving
this car back to Cornwall.

1:09:13.215 --> 1:09:15.781
Don't be so stupid.
He was bluffing.

1:09:16.334 --> 1:09:19.043
As long as we have the
merchandise, we have the power.

1:09:19.161 --> 1:09:23.088
Do I know you? What are you talking
about "merchandise and power"?

1:09:23.206 --> 1:09:26.119
Look at the way you're dressed.
You're like Ma fucking Baker!

1:09:26.219 --> 1:09:28.220
- Language!
- Don't you "Language" me!

1:09:28.337 --> 1:09:31.642
- I nearly got my throat cut for you!
- You weren't supposed to be here.

1:09:31.742 --> 1:09:34.917
Fine! Do it yourself with
Jacques fucking Cousteau then!

1:09:35.035 --> 1:09:36.786
- I'm out!
- What?

1:10:10.785 --> 1:10:14.351
I can't find Grace's plants
anywhere.

1:10:14.451 --> 1:10:17.713
This tea has the most
extraordinary aroma.

1:10:17.830 --> 1:10:19.495
Darjeeling?

1:10:19.655 --> 1:10:21.234
Trevethyn.

1:10:21.352 --> 1:10:23.570
Oh, Diana, you never...

1:10:23.670 --> 1:10:27.411
Just a little cutting.
I do love fresh tea.

1:10:27.529 --> 1:10:30.543
So do I, dear. Give it here.

1:10:34.574 --> 1:10:36.284
That's lovely.

1:10:50.188 --> 1:10:52.506
I'm sorry for shouting at you.

1:10:58.929 --> 1:11:01.930
How else am I gonna
get the money?

1:11:02.030 --> 1:11:04.030
I don't know.

1:11:05.801 --> 1:11:07.858
It's Nicky.

1:11:07.975 --> 1:11:11.411
She doesn't want a relationship
with someone irresponsible.

1:11:11.511 --> 1:11:15.034
And I don't want a relationship
with someone who isn't Nicky.

1:11:17.803 --> 1:11:20.514
That's better.
Ready for my breakfast now.

1:11:20.631 --> 1:11:22.231
Come on!

1:11:38.202 --> 1:11:40.519
For Christ's sake!

1:11:40.636 --> 1:11:44.477
Okay, we harvest the plants and
we get the stuff up to London...

1:11:44.595 --> 1:11:47.566
and we never do it again!
- Thank you.

1:11:48.422 --> 1:11:51.871
We do it quick as well. I don't
want another knife on my throat.

1:11:53.771 --> 1:11:58.525
You know, this is the site
of the new proposed B-323.

1:11:58.644 --> 1:12:02.047
Due for completion early 2004.

1:12:02.251 --> 1:12:05.339
I can't believe you lost them!
How could you've lost them?

1:12:05.439 --> 1:12:08.007
It's not as if there's
a lot of traffic out there!

1:12:08.559 --> 1:12:10.529
I'm sorry, right?

1:12:10.646 --> 1:12:15.038
I'm not a career criminal.
I don't have tailing abilities.

1:12:15.138 --> 1:12:18.836
Are you getting lippy with me?
Don't start getting lippy with me!

1:12:19.866 --> 1:12:22.446
What? I'm just trying
to make the best of it.

1:12:22.562 --> 1:12:26.737
Since we came all the way here,
we might as well enjoy the day out.

1:12:26.837 --> 1:12:30.404
Get in the car.
Just shut up and get in the car!

1:12:30.566 --> 1:12:35.405
You need to sort out some anger
management when you get home.

1:12:37.305 --> 1:12:38.705
Harvey?

1:12:41.134 --> 1:12:44.656
You forgot your meeting with the
WI. They were in the greenhouse...

1:12:44.756 --> 1:12:48.106
It's alright, I bluffed them.
And Nicky was here.

1:12:49.091 --> 1:12:51.179
What did you tell her?

1:12:51.279 --> 1:12:55.398
That you went to London with Dr.
Bamford help Grace sell the drugs.

1:12:55.498 --> 1:12:58.616
- Shit! Grace, I have to go see her.
- That's alright, don't worry.

1:12:58.716 --> 1:13:01.413
Harvey and I will start
on the greenhouse.

1:13:01.530 --> 1:13:03.588
Come on, Harvey.

1:13:04.010 --> 1:13:08.228
Thanks. Do you know where
Liac House is? Mrs. Trevethyn?

1:13:08.328 --> 1:13:10.381
- No.
- I'll ask around.

1:13:10.481 --> 1:13:12.199
- Try the shop.
- Keep the change.

1:13:12.317 --> 1:13:13.917
Right-o.

1:13:17.100 --> 1:13:18.939
Thank you.

1:13:32.365 --> 1:13:34.596
Hello! Anybody home?

1:13:36.542 --> 1:13:37.742
Hello?

1:13:49.893 --> 1:13:52.893
May I help you?

1:14:03.853 --> 1:14:08.476
Would you like some Corn Flakes?
They're heavenly.

1:14:09.767 --> 1:14:12.303
No, thank you.
I've already eaten.

1:14:31.121 --> 1:14:34.441
Would you like
a chocolate ice cream?

1:14:34.950 --> 1:14:40.311
I'm looking for Liac House.
I want to contact Grace Trevethyn.

1:14:41.299 --> 1:14:45.096
I love Grace.
I really, really love her.

1:14:45.692 --> 1:14:47.954
She's an angel.

1:14:48.054 --> 1:14:50.663
She has wonderful hair...

1:14:50.868 --> 1:14:55.664
soft and silky,
like a lovely angora rabbit.

1:14:58.174 --> 1:14:59.374
Right.

1:15:00.566 --> 1:15:04.144
- Where do I find her?
- She lives...

1:15:04.741 --> 1:15:07.612
in a lovely, lovely house.

1:15:07.712 --> 1:15:12.351
- I love her.
- How do I get to the lovely house?

1:15:12.451 --> 1:15:15.105
Up the lovely, lovely hill.

1:15:15.526 --> 1:15:19.845
Lovely, lovely, lovely

1:15:21.528 --> 1:15:24.542
One, two, three, now.

1:15:28.703 --> 1:15:29.903
Nicky!

1:15:35.315 --> 1:15:36.515
Nicky!

1:15:39.490 --> 1:15:42.057
Nicky, I'm sorry
I did something illegal.

1:15:42.157 --> 1:15:45.025
- I'm gonna get a proper job!
- What?

1:15:45.622 --> 1:15:48.331
I'm ready to be responsible!

1:15:49.188 --> 1:15:53.507
- I love you!
- I can't hear you! What did you say?

1:15:53.668 --> 1:15:55.856
I love you!

1:15:56.408 --> 1:15:59.727
I love you! I'm pregnant!

1:16:00.322 --> 1:16:04.424
- What?
- I'm having a baby!

1:16:15.284 --> 1:16:18.254
No, no! Get out of the water!
You're pregnant!

1:16:24.112 --> 1:16:27.344
No, no! You can't swim!
You're pregnant!

1:17:12.561 --> 1:17:14.662
Mrs. Trevethyn?

1:17:14.780 --> 1:17:16.976
It's Quentin Rhodes.

1:17:17.076 --> 1:17:21.403
I can't see that person. Not now,
you've got to get rid of him.

1:17:21.522 --> 1:17:25.130
- What do I say?
- I don't know. Tell him anything.

1:17:25.230 --> 1:17:29.491
Tell him I'm still in London, I've
been kidnapped by aliens, anything!

1:17:33.045 --> 1:17:35.059
- Charlie, whiskey!
- Thank God.

1:17:35.176 --> 1:17:38.190
I've been trying to reach you at
the house. No one answer the phone!

1:17:38.308 --> 1:17:40.451
- What's wrong?
- There were two men here.

1:17:40.569 --> 1:17:45.020
Londoners. Asking about Grace.
I thought, maybe, Customs.

1:17:45.136 --> 1:17:46.136
Fuck!

1:17:55.399 --> 1:17:57.748
- That's them.
- Oh, shit!

1:17:57.848 --> 1:17:59.370
- What?
- They're no Customs.

1:17:59.487 --> 1:18:02.501
- They're drug dealers from London.
- So I was right about London.

1:18:02.619 --> 1:18:06.634
We'll go up to the house. Nicky,
meet us there with Dr. Bamford.

1:18:11.405 --> 1:18:13.809
Give this to me!
What's the matter with you?

1:18:13.927 --> 1:18:16.853
Get up there! How many times
have I gotta tell you?

1:18:20.234 --> 1:18:21.942
- Alfred.
- What is it?

1:18:22.102 --> 1:18:25.334
The two men who own this car,
they were just in the pub.

1:18:25.452 --> 1:18:29.367
I overheard them talking about how
much they enjoy salmon poaching.

1:18:29.467 --> 1:18:30.867
Really?

1:18:31.511 --> 1:18:36.251
Thank you, Nicky. There could be
a community service for you.

1:18:36.369 --> 1:18:39.947
Thanks, I've gotta go.
I'm pregnant.

1:18:40.109 --> 1:18:42.644
Oh, yes, yes, of course.

1:18:46.458 --> 1:18:49.080
- What are they doing here?
- They're not on holiday, Grace.

1:18:49.198 --> 1:18:51.764
- But Jacques said a week.
- Well, he lied.

1:18:51.864 --> 1:18:54.721
- Quentin Rhodes is here.
- Who the fuck is Quentin Rhodes?

1:18:54.821 --> 1:18:56.896
Harvey is holding him off.
What are we gonna do?

1:18:56.996 --> 1:18:59.936
Let's just get rid of this stuff
and get this thing over with, okay?

1:19:04.028 --> 1:19:05.228
Jesus!

1:19:17.293 --> 1:19:20.220
Up the hill,
second house on the left.

1:19:30.557 --> 1:19:33.559
5-7 to base.
Suspects under surveillance.

1:19:33.659 --> 1:19:35.441
Copy that. On our way.

1:19:43.084 --> 1:19:45.140
Mrs. Trevethyn!

1:19:45.910 --> 1:19:50.752
I've just come to warn you there are
2 men who are part of a salmon...

1:19:57.174 --> 1:19:59.175
It's parsley.

1:19:59.275 --> 1:20:01.928
It's marijuana, isn't it?

1:20:03.133 --> 1:20:04.280
Yes.

1:20:05.351 --> 1:20:09.178
I knew you and Matthew were
growing it, but I had no idea.

1:20:09.278 --> 1:20:12.310
- You knew?
- I live around here, don't I?

1:20:12.410 --> 1:20:16.485
But with your financial problems,
I thought I'd turn a blind eye...

1:20:16.585 --> 1:20:19.106
to a bit of homegrown.

1:20:19.223 --> 1:20:23.544
But, Grace, this is a huge amount.

1:20:27.271 --> 1:20:31.837
It's good stuff too. Better than
the shit you grew at the vicarage.

1:20:31.937 --> 1:20:33.982
You knew about that?

1:20:34.230 --> 1:20:38.244
Alfred, in a few minutes,
we'll have got rid of it.

1:20:38.578 --> 1:20:41.854
Can't you turn your blind eye
just a little bit longer?

1:20:42.275 --> 1:20:47.494
It's not me, it's the officers
from Coldock H.Q. which worry me.

1:20:47.594 --> 1:20:50.943
- Oh, God, what are we gonna do?
- If I were you...

1:20:51.061 --> 1:20:55.075
I'd get rid of this stuff quick.
I'm gonna go look for poachers.

1:21:05.500 --> 1:21:07.600
Excuse me a moment.

1:21:33.768 --> 1:21:36.433
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

1:21:36.552 --> 1:21:38.347
He asked first.

1:21:38.508 --> 1:21:42.784
I'm here to do some business
with Mrs. Trevethyn.

1:21:45.206 --> 1:21:47.206
So are we.

1:21:47.524 --> 1:21:48.924
Really?

1:21:49.903 --> 1:21:53.049
Are you interested in buying
the property or do you have...

1:21:53.209 --> 1:21:55.449
a claim on it in some way?

1:21:55.549 --> 1:21:57.485
What is this?

1:22:03.343 --> 1:22:05.704
Well, there it is.

1:22:06.126 --> 1:22:08.126
We did it.

1:22:09.170 --> 1:22:11.227
We did, didn't we?

1:22:13.303 --> 1:22:15.664
There's another 2 men here.
What are we gonna do?

1:22:15.780 --> 1:22:18.752
- Skin up.
- Even you can't smoke all of it.

1:22:18.912 --> 1:22:23.143
- I could try.
- Maybe no one should have the stuff.

1:22:27.480 --> 1:22:29.080
Alright.

1:22:30.002 --> 1:22:32.754
- Thank you, Matthew.
- You're welcome, Grace.

1:22:34.134 --> 1:22:36.627
Put that match out!

1:22:37.093 --> 1:22:40.353
Look, I have no idea
what's going on but...

1:22:40.453 --> 1:22:42.672
I think you'd better put it out.

1:22:43.572 --> 1:22:48.674
That's the most beautiful
and awesome thing I've ever seen.

1:22:52.183 --> 1:22:54.718
Hello, Mrs. Trevethyn.
I hope we're not too early.

1:22:54.836 --> 1:22:56.980
Who the hell are you?

1:23:01.447 --> 1:23:02.447
Shit.

1:23:08.753 --> 1:23:12.073
Look, ladies.
No, ladies, no, no!

1:23:12.189 --> 1:23:15.072
- Come on, make a run for it.
- What about you?

1:23:15.233 --> 1:23:17.247
Don't worry about me.
I can handle this.

1:23:17.407 --> 1:23:19.247
No, we did this together.
I'm staying.

1:23:19.408 --> 1:23:24.293
I love you both very much indeed.
But, Matthew, you're fired.

1:23:24.410 --> 1:23:26.010
Come on.

1:23:45.111 --> 1:23:47.168
Get off! Get off!

1:23:47.287 --> 1:23:49.887
Get that man!

1:23:50.288 --> 1:23:52.766
What are you arresting me for?

1:23:52.866 --> 1:23:55.911
No, madam! Stop there! Right...

1:24:18.165 --> 1:24:20.179
Hello, Grace.

1:24:40.476 --> 1:24:42.737
I trusted you.

1:24:42.837 --> 1:24:45.717
Whatever happened
to honor amongst thieves?

1:24:45.817 --> 1:24:49.753
- What about our deal?
- It's nice to see you too.

1:24:49.914 --> 1:24:51.971
You can't even do
your own dirty work.

1:24:52.088 --> 1:24:54.623
- Dirty work?
- Why did you send in your boys?

1:24:54.783 --> 1:24:57.046
To keep an eye on you.

1:24:57.146 --> 1:25:00.102
To stop you from coming
to any harm.

1:25:00.307 --> 1:25:03.409
- Do you expect me to believe that?
- It's the truth.

1:25:06.180 --> 1:25:09.062
I hope I haven't spoiled
everything.

1:25:18.356 --> 1:25:20.848
Are you trying to escape?

1:25:22.835 --> 1:25:27.285
- Maybe I could help.
- No, thank you.

1:25:33.056 --> 1:25:35.157
Mrs. Trevethyn!

1:25:35.711 --> 1:25:36.911
Grace!

1:25:38.581 --> 1:25:42.377
Those fingers through my hair

1:25:42.494 --> 1:25:46.377
That sly come hither stare

1:25:46.757 --> 1:25:52.076
That strips my conscience bare
It's witchcraft

1:25:54.846 --> 1:25:58.948
And I've got no defense for it

1:25:59.064 --> 1:26:03.035
The heat is too intense for it

1:26:03.196 --> 1:26:07.689
What good would
common sense for it do?

1:26:10.067 --> 1:26:12.951
Cause it's witchcraft

1:26:14.547 --> 1:26:17.909
- Witchcraft
- I like it here.

1:26:18.026 --> 1:26:24.824
And although I know
it's strictly taboo

1:26:27.421 --> 1:26:30.652
When you ride with me

1:26:32.423 --> 1:26:35.261
Is this the face
of a master criminal?

1:26:35.380 --> 1:26:39.350
Tonight, we investigate the
mystery behind Grace Trevethyn.

1:26:39.467 --> 1:26:42.089
How did an unknown widow
facing bankruptcy...

1:26:42.207 --> 1:26:46.614
saved her house and become the most
celebrated novelist of the year.

1:26:48.557 --> 1:26:50.875
Mrs. Trevethyn's novel,
"The Joint Venture"...

1:26:50.993 --> 1:26:53.963
has topped the best seller
list for over a year now.

1:26:54.081 --> 1:26:58.094
Although the book is sold as fiction,
the story bears remarkable similarity...

1:26:58.212 --> 1:27:00.212
to Trevethyn's own life.

1:27:00.312 --> 1:27:03.691
And her recent marriage to a
mysterious French businessman...

1:27:03.791 --> 1:27:07.562
has fueled tabloids' speculation
that she was, at one time...

1:27:07.662 --> 1:27:09.707
actually involved
with the drug trade.

1:27:09.824 --> 1:27:12.143
So, what is the true story?

1:27:12.259 --> 1:27:14.969
We went to the sleepy village
of Port Liac to find out.

1:27:15.087 --> 1:27:17.144
Turn it up, Charlie, turn it up.

1:27:17.306 --> 1:27:19.406
Wasn't there an incident
up at the Liac House?

1:27:19.567 --> 1:27:23.537
The police were called, but there
was a problem with witnesses.

1:27:23.654 --> 1:27:26.754
- No one wanted to talk?
- No one could remember anything.

1:27:26.871 --> 1:27:28.757
Excuse me.

1:27:29.222 --> 1:27:32.539
- We think it's fiction, don't we?
- Yeah.

1:27:32.700 --> 1:27:35.192
Because, in the book...

1:27:35.658 --> 1:27:40.716
Grace was growing drugs. But,
in real life, she was growing tea!

1:27:42.877 --> 1:27:45.240
As a doctor, a man of science...

1:27:48.356 --> 1:27:53.155
I could never condone the use of
a drug for a non-therapeutic thingy.

1:27:55.403 --> 1:27:58.982
- Have you got anything?
- See me later. It's good.

1:27:59.098 --> 1:28:00.460
- Is it?
- Ooh...

1:28:00.839 --> 1:28:07.072
It does seem strange that alcohol
is legal and marijuana is not.

1:28:07.363 --> 1:28:10.160
It's an accident of History,
I suppose.

1:28:15.364 --> 1:28:18.640
So you didn't have any marijuana
growing in your garden?

1:28:19.845 --> 1:28:21.685
Bless you.

1:28:23.715 --> 1:28:26.629
Do you think "The Joint
Venture" is fiction or fact?

1:28:26.729 --> 1:28:31.209
No, it's all fiction. My wife has
a fertile imagination, thank God.

1:28:31.370 --> 1:28:34.775
What about the gangster character
Pedro? Is that based on you?

1:28:34.893 --> 1:28:37.602
Pedro is Spanish, I'm French.
Don't be absurd.

1:28:37.719 --> 1:28:39.759
- No, but we've heard...
- It's time for you to go.

1:28:39.894 --> 1:28:42.821
Get off of my land.
I said this is my house!

1:28:45.287 --> 1:28:48.867
Grace Trevethyn refused
to be interviewed to this program.

1:28:49.289 --> 1:28:52.259
And to date she's made no public
statements about the rumors.

1:28:52.420 --> 1:28:53.824
Tonight may change that...

1:28:53.942 --> 1:28:56.651
as we take you live to
the New York Book Awards...

1:28:56.769 --> 1:29:01.176
where Grace Trevethyn has been
short listed for "The Joint Venture".

1:29:01.292 --> 1:29:05.001
And the winner of the
Award for Fiction goes to...

1:29:08.250 --> 1:29:11.525
Grace Trevethyn,
for "The Joint Venture"!

1:29:26.821 --> 1:29:28.878
Gosh, what a surprise!

1:29:31.170 --> 1:29:36.011
I should be used to surprises after
everything that's happened to me.

1:29:36.476 --> 1:29:39.607
I know there's been
a lot of speculation about...

1:29:39.707 --> 1:29:43.752
whether my book is based
on fact or fiction, but...

1:29:43.915 --> 1:29:47.015
well, to tell you the truth...

1:29:47.176 --> 1:29:52.798
if I told you what's happened to me,
you wouldn't believe me anyway.

1:29:52.915 --> 1:29:55.321
I can hardly believe it myself.

1:29:56.916 --> 1:30:00.452
I hope they're watching
this at home, because...

1:30:01.005 --> 1:30:03.062
I wanted to say...

1:30:06.138 --> 1:30:07.890
Matthew...

1:30:08.138 --> 1:30:12.413
I wanted to tell you that I think
you are a terrible gardener...

1:30:14.531 --> 1:30:17.198
but that you have
helped me to grow.

1:30:17.576 --> 1:30:23.068
And for that I thank you
from the bottom of my heart.

1:30:25.577 --> 1:30:29.853
I hope you're having a great party.
Keep the drinks flowing, Charlie.

1:30:33.058 --> 1:30:37.856
I've had another idea. I think
there might be a book in it.

1:30:42.300 --> 1:30:44.100
Thank You
