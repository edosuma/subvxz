00:29.297 --> 00:30.631
Oh! In your face.

00:31.665 --> 00:32.800
Sorry, Momma.

00:32.833 --> 00:34.668
I just loves me
some Halloweenie.

00:34.702 --> 00:36.137
We all love Halloween.

00:36.170 --> 00:38.306
Oh, yeah!
The best party of the year.

00:38.772 --> 00:40.808
The candy.

00:40.841 --> 00:42.510
The spooky decorations.

00:43.211 --> 00:44.778
The costumes.

00:44.812 --> 00:46.647
And, speaking of costumes,

00:46.680 --> 00:49.717
we need to prepare for this
year's Halloween costume contest.

00:49.750 --> 00:52.353
All right! Oh, yes!

00:52.386 --> 00:54.588
To win, we are going
to need to go all out.

00:54.622 --> 00:56.324
I have come up with
several options.

00:56.357 --> 00:57.858
Ooh.

00:57.891 --> 00:59.293
These are strong.

00:59.327 --> 01:01.195
- Ooh.
- Real strong.

01:02.596 --> 01:03.731
Hang on a second.

01:03.764 --> 01:06.234
Titans Tower, Robin speaking.

01:12.373 --> 01:13.674
Boo!

01:16.244 --> 01:17.645
Let me guess,

01:17.678 --> 01:21.515
you guys are gonna be
scaredy-cats for Halloween.

01:22.483 --> 01:24.318
What do you want, Gizmo?

01:24.352 --> 01:27.355
Eh, we figured since we are
going to win the costume contest,

01:27.388 --> 01:28.822
again this year.

01:28.856 --> 01:31.659
We wanted to start
rubbing it in your faces early.

01:33.261 --> 01:34.495
Yee-hah.

01:34.528 --> 01:35.896
You'll rub our faces in nothing!

01:35.929 --> 01:38.699
Oh, your faces will be
rubbed in it all right.

01:38.732 --> 01:41.502
We've got our best costume ever this year.

01:41.535 --> 01:43.804
There's no way
you're going to beat us.

01:43.837 --> 01:45.639
Later, losers.

01:45.673 --> 01:46.807
I hate those guys.

01:46.840 --> 01:48.342
They're the worst.

01:48.376 --> 01:49.910
They do come up with
sick costumes, though.

01:49.943 --> 01:53.181
Remembers that one years when
they dressed up like a hamburger.

01:53.214 --> 01:56.417
And the time they dressed up like
those cool skateboarding turtle-dudes.

01:56.450 --> 02:00.154
Or, when they dressed as
the many-legged insect.

02:00.188 --> 02:01.522
We'll never beat them.

02:01.555 --> 02:03.691
Not with these boring costumes.

02:03.724 --> 02:05.826
We might as well
rub our own faces in it.

02:08.862 --> 02:11.865
Stop that! The only faces that
will be rubbed in it tonight

02:11.899 --> 02:13.367
are the H.I.V.E.'s.

02:13.401 --> 02:15.603
But this endeavor is
the use of the less.

02:15.636 --> 02:18.506
No, we just need to
up our costume game.

02:18.539 --> 02:21.242
Do something even better
than we planned, so,

02:21.275 --> 02:24.812
let's just stay calm and try to
come up with some great ideas.

02:25.679 --> 02:27.415
Hmm...

02:28.616 --> 02:32.320
Oh, I knows. What if we be some ghosts?

02:32.353 --> 02:35.356
Ghosts?
That's the best you can come up with?

02:35.389 --> 02:36.724
Are you even trying?

02:36.757 --> 02:39.327
Whoa, it's not his fault.

02:39.360 --> 02:42.463
The only people clever enough to come up with a
costume to beat the H.I.V.E. are the H.I.V.E.

02:42.496 --> 02:45.433
That's it, we are going to
beat the H.I.V.E.,

02:45.466 --> 02:46.867
by being the H.I.V.E.

02:46.900 --> 02:48.869
Oh! You wish for us,

02:48.902 --> 02:52.506
to don not the costumes
of our own villainous rivals?

02:52.540 --> 02:54.508
Good guys dressing up like
bad guys?

02:54.542 --> 02:56.577
Bro, you some kind of
spacial genius.

02:56.610 --> 02:58.879
That trophy is as good as ours.

03:00.848 --> 03:01.882
Titans, sew!

03:24.938 --> 03:27.941
Uh, we're never going to win
wearing this trash.

03:27.975 --> 03:30.511
Ugh, I didn't know
sewing was so hard!

03:30.544 --> 03:35.683
I must now take back all of the terrible,
terrible things I have said about the Betsy Ross.

03:35.716 --> 03:37.451
Well, you know what this means.

03:37.485 --> 03:39.653
Time to start rubbing
our own faces in it.

03:40.921 --> 03:43.724
Stop it, stop!
Forget the face-rubbing Titans.

03:43.757 --> 03:45.759
I say we break into
the H.I.V.E. Tower

03:45.793 --> 03:48.629
and borrow
their actual costumes.

03:48.662 --> 03:50.731
- You mean steal.
- Of course, I mean steal.

03:50.764 --> 03:52.966
That's why I said "borrow,"
like that.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.468
Awesome.
Okay.

03:54.502 --> 03:56.003
Titans, steal!

04:08.482 --> 04:11.619
Uh, never seen the H.I.V.E.'s
tower with the lights off.

04:11.652 --> 04:13.621
Uh, its giving me the willies.

04:13.654 --> 04:18.025
Regardless of willies, screaming me-mes,
jitters, shakes, and or shivers...

04:20.594 --> 04:22.763
We need to get those costumes.
Follow me.

04:26.334 --> 04:28.769
Oh, it is the indoor cloud.

04:28.802 --> 04:29.970
What? Ah!

04:30.003 --> 04:31.905
Clouds are supposed
to be outside.

04:31.939 --> 04:35.376
What is this?
Strange weather is freaking me out.

04:38.011 --> 04:39.913
Hold up. Hold up.

04:39.947 --> 04:41.882
It's just a fog machine, yo.

04:41.915 --> 04:43.351
Right. Phew!

04:43.384 --> 04:44.985
Let's keep moving.

04:49.357 --> 04:51.392
It's probably just the wind.

04:51.425 --> 04:53.427
I'm really not liking
this indoor weather.

04:54.995 --> 04:56.564
Poltergeist!

04:58.999 --> 05:00.368
Hold up. Hold up.

05:00.401 --> 05:04.672
It's just sheet on a rope and a
recording of some spooky voice.

05:04.705 --> 05:08.409
I'm gonna eat your face.

05:08.442 --> 05:10.344
Oh, uh, Of course.

05:10.378 --> 05:11.679
Let's keep moving.

05:11.712 --> 05:15.015
Not this time. Spooky
Halloween decoration.

05:15.048 --> 05:17.351
Wow, you gotta
give to the H.I.V.E.,

05:17.385 --> 05:18.752
they really do Halloween right.

05:18.786 --> 05:20.654
Fog machine, spooky ghost,

05:20.688 --> 05:23.457
and the sweet,
animatronic prisoners arm.

05:23.491 --> 05:25.025
These decorations is legit.

05:25.058 --> 05:28.662
It is not the wonder they
always win the costume contest.

05:28.696 --> 05:30.330
They won't this year.

05:39.673 --> 05:41.575
Everyone, grab a costume.

05:44.678 --> 05:47.014
Hey, I can't wear this.

05:47.047 --> 05:48.716
It's too small.

05:48.749 --> 05:51.051
I'm concerned that
it may be too large.

05:52.886 --> 05:54.922
Fine. Titans, suit up.

05:56.724 --> 05:58.158
Hey, check me out.

05:58.191 --> 06:01.629
I'm Mammoth. I don't really
talk on the show

06:01.662 --> 06:02.963
I'm Gizmo, yo.

06:02.996 --> 06:05.433
I sees you, Billy Numerous.

06:05.466 --> 06:06.600
Who, me?

06:06.634 --> 06:08.035
Or me, me, me?

06:08.068 --> 06:09.169
Or me?

06:09.202 --> 06:12.072
Ah, so many mamas.

06:12.105 --> 06:13.874
Whoo, I am the Jinx.

06:13.907 --> 06:16.744
The bad luck. The broken mirror.
The black cat.

06:16.777 --> 06:19.747
The walking
under the the ladder.

06:19.780 --> 06:21.682
Uh, something is wrong
with this costume.

06:21.715 --> 06:23.617
You are a tiny dude, aren't you?

06:23.651 --> 06:25.152
I'm a man of every tight!

06:25.185 --> 06:27.421
Uh, things I go through
to win a trophy...

06:27.455 --> 06:29.623
What's going on here?

06:29.657 --> 06:32.726
We're winning the
costume contest, that's what.

06:32.760 --> 06:35.062
Hmm, hero's dressing up
like villains.

06:35.095 --> 06:36.063
Not bad.

06:36.096 --> 06:37.965
But it's not enough to beat us.

06:37.998 --> 06:39.667
Check it.

06:41.835 --> 06:43.036
Oh, wow.

06:45.238 --> 06:49.009
Now, that's just sick!

06:55.849 --> 06:57.951
It's the ultimate costume.

06:57.985 --> 06:59.620
I did not know that such heights

06:59.653 --> 07:02.723
were the attainable with the
costume of hallowed-ween.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.725
I've never seen
anything like it.

07:04.758 --> 07:08.962
Titans in the face of a costume
so brilliant and undeniable.

07:08.996 --> 07:10.731
There's only one thing to do.

07:10.764 --> 07:11.865
Concede to us.

07:11.899 --> 07:14.167
Destroy the H.I.V.E.'s costume!

07:14.201 --> 07:15.769
That's not fair.

07:15.803 --> 07:17.104
Oh, that's not fair.

07:17.137 --> 07:18.772
Titans, cheat!

07:24.845 --> 07:27.615
Oh, no.
Your costume's all ruined.

07:27.648 --> 07:30.751
Looks like the Teen Titans
are sure to win this year.

07:30.784 --> 07:31.952
See ya.

07:31.985 --> 07:34.622
Oh, wait till I get my hands
on them.

07:34.655 --> 07:36.123
Hold on!

07:36.156 --> 07:38.191
I have an idea.

07:44.064 --> 07:45.866
Boo!

07:47.801 --> 07:49.837
Attention! Attention, everyone.

07:49.870 --> 07:51.905
Peep this.

07:51.939 --> 07:55.676
Welcome to the third annual
costume contest.

07:55.709 --> 07:59.613
Woot, woot! We have got
some sick competition this year.

07:59.647 --> 08:01.782
Let's see what our judges think.

08:05.118 --> 08:07.688
The third place award goes to,

08:07.721 --> 08:09.523
The Brain.

08:10.991 --> 08:13.093
The second place award goes to,

08:13.126 --> 08:16.697
Batman and Commissioner Gordon.

08:16.730 --> 08:19.700
And, now, the moment
you have been waiting for.

08:21.334 --> 08:22.936
This is it, this is it.

08:22.970 --> 08:29.877
This year first place blue ribbon for
coming correct on best costume goes to...

08:29.910 --> 08:31.945
Not so fast, Titans!

08:36.316 --> 08:38.986
And boom goes the dynamite,
fellas.

08:39.019 --> 08:41.321
My mind is blown.

08:41.354 --> 08:43.256
Seems we have some
new contestants.

08:43.290 --> 08:45.258
These villains stole our suits.

08:45.292 --> 08:47.728
Only after you stole ours first.

08:47.761 --> 08:49.963
And ruined our
original costumes!

08:49.997 --> 08:53.901
Dang, Titans, straight up gank move.
Say it ain't so.

08:53.934 --> 08:55.969
Every body knows
that don't count,

08:56.003 --> 08:58.005
on account of us
being the good guys,

08:58.038 --> 09:01.141
and those fools
being the bad guys.

09:01.174 --> 09:03.577
Hold up heroes,
y'all needs to stay woke.

09:03.611 --> 09:06.680
To wrongs do not make
a riggity-right.

09:06.714 --> 09:08.048
Birdarang is right.

09:08.081 --> 09:10.651
Maybe we took our passion
to win a little too far.

09:10.684 --> 09:13.020
There's only one way
to make this right.

09:13.053 --> 09:14.321
H.I.V.E., go!

09:14.354 --> 09:15.656
Titans, go!

09:19.059 --> 09:21.862
Azarath Metrion Zinthos!

09:35.375 --> 09:36.677
Time out, yo.

09:36.710 --> 09:38.812
The judges have
made their decision.

09:38.846 --> 09:40.614
So, without further ado,

09:40.648 --> 09:41.915
this prize goes to...

09:41.949 --> 09:43.083
The H.I.V.E.,

09:43.116 --> 09:45.285
and The Titans.

09:45.318 --> 09:46.353
Word.

09:46.386 --> 09:47.688
We won!

09:47.721 --> 09:48.822
And we won too?

09:48.856 --> 09:49.990
That's riggity-right.

09:50.023 --> 09:52.626
Now, lets turn this party out.
