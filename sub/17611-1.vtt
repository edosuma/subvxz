Fuck! Here we are!

00:36.704 --> 00:38.455
Paid vacation in Europe, here we go!

00:38.497 --> 00:40.666
Fucking right! It looks the

00:38.497 --> 00:40.666
same over here.

00:40.708 --> 00:42.668
It is kind of the same, Ricky.

Oh, check it out, there's the

00:48.298 --> 00:50.467
Tour bus, two blocks to the right.

00:50.509 --> 00:52.469
Swearnet gave us a tour bus!

Oh, I'm getting so fucked up over here!

00:54.304 --> 00:56.473
I need a drink.

00:56.515 --> 00:58.099
Okay, just wait. Didn't they say go left?

No, they said take a right.

Two blocks to the right.

Hold on a second. Which right?

What do you mean, what's right?

01:03.731 --> 01:05.399
This is right. That's the station,

01:03.731 --> 01:05.399
like this.

01:05.440 --> 01:07.234
We're here. Is that right? Bubs, this

01:05.440 --> 01:07.234

01:07.275 --> 01:09.069
We go to the right, boys.

01:07.275 --> 01:09.069
But that's not really right.

01:09.110 --> 01:10.696
Right could be down that way.

01:10.738 --> 01:12.406
It's this way! This is right.

01:12.447 --> 01:14.366
Let's just go down this way. It's two blocks.

01:14.408 --> 01:16.076
Let's go, come on. All right. Well,

01:14.408 --> 01:16.076

Things are kind of backwards.

01:33.761 --> 01:35.554
Bubbles: Everything's backwards.

01:33.761 --> 01:35.554
So you've got to look...

01:35.596 --> 01:36.972
See it says, "look right".

The cars are coming this way.

I can't believe you guys made it through customs.

03:21.242 --> 03:22.619
I've heard that, actually.

03:22.661 --> 03:24.203
You don't do that on tour buses.

03:24.245 --> 03:25.914

03:46.267 --> 03:48.228
Ricky: What the fuck is

03:46.267 --> 03:48.228
with these ceilings?

03:48.269 --> 03:51.065
Ah! Why are they so low?

03:51.106 --> 03:53.441
It's a double-fucking-decker bus, that's why.

03:53.483 --> 03:55.443
Ricky: Wow, look at

03:53.483 --> 03:55.443
these fucking beds!

03:55.485 --> 03:57.445
You're on that side. I'm on the other side.

03:57.487 --> 03:59.239
It's kind of like a submaline.

03:59.280 --> 04:01.075
Bubbles: I'm going to take

03:59.280 --> 04:01.075
top bunk,

04:01.116 --> 04:03.077
be like Snoopy! (Chuckling)

04:03.118 --> 04:05.079
Sleep with your head towards the rear.

04:05.120 --> 04:06.663
Why is that?

04:06.705 --> 04:08.248
So that when the bus driver hits the brakes,

04:08.289 --> 04:10.417
he doesn't snap your fucking neck.

04:10.458 --> 04:13.670
Yeah, why would you crank 'er to the side?

04:10.458 --> 04:13.670
Just lean forward.

04:13.712 --> 04:15.839
Aw, fuck. All right, you boys

04:13.712 --> 04:15.839
got any questions?

04:15.881 --> 04:17.716
Yeah. Where's our money?

04:17.758 --> 04:19.718
We've got to get some fucking drink.

04:17.758 --> 04:19.718
What money?

04:19.760 --> 04:21.678
Our money. Like, we were promised

04:19.760 --> 04:21.678
some money.

04:21.720 --> 04:23.680
Yeah, as soon as you accomplish your tasks.

04:23.722 --> 04:25.265
Ricky: What the fuck are

04:23.722 --> 04:25.265
you talking about?

04:25.306 --> 04:27.267
Well, Swearnet sent your tasks right here.

04:27.308 --> 04:29.686
Ricky: It's a paid vacation,

04:27.308 --> 04:29.686
is it not? Tom: No.

04:29.728 --> 04:32.355
Julian: Tasks? What the fuck

04:29.728 --> 04:32.355
are you talking about, tasks?

04:32.397 --> 04:34.315
"Get Noel Fielding's autograph, 25 dollars."

04:34.357 --> 04:36.568
I don't know who that is but it doesn't

04:34.357 --> 04:36.568
sound too bad.

04:36.610 --> 04:37.986
Who the fuck is Noel Fielding?

04:38.028 --> 04:39.487
Noel Fielding, the fucking comedian!

04:39.529 --> 04:40.948
How are we going to get that?

04:40.989 --> 04:42.532
You got any drugs for us or booze?

04:42.574 --> 04:44.159
I need to get fucking high,

04:42.574 --> 04:44.159
big time! Drugs?

04:44.201 --> 04:45.702
There'll be no fucking drugs on this bus.

04:45.744 --> 04:47.162
We've got border crossings.

04:47.204 --> 04:48.914
I'm not going to fucking prison for you fucks.

04:48.956 --> 04:50.540
You've got to be kidding me.

04:48.956 --> 04:50.540
Look, man...

04:50.582 --> 04:52.500
You're joking, right? No, I'm not joking.

04:52.542 --> 04:54.294
This is our bus and I need to get high

04:54.335 --> 04:55.921
every fucking day, lots of times.

04:55.963 --> 04:57.547
You can do it outside.

04:57.589 --> 04:59.299
Ricky, just shut the fuck up

04:57.589 --> 04:59.299
for a second.

04:59.340 --> 05:00.926
I read through the fucking contract

05:00.968 --> 05:03.053
and it had nothing about tasks and shit.

05:03.095 --> 05:04.304
Did you read it all?

05:04.345 --> 05:05.680
Yeah, I read most of it.

05:05.722 --> 05:06.932
Most of it?

05:06.974 --> 05:09.726
Page 17, Paragraph fucking 3.

05:09.768 --> 05:11.770
All contracts are basically the same.

05:11.812 --> 05:14.522
I mean, all the important shit's in the first three pages,

05:14.564 --> 05:16.733
the rest is just useless garbage.

05:16.775 --> 05:20.320
Who the fuck puts vital information on page 17?

05:20.361 --> 05:22.948
Every word that's in a contract is put there for a reason.

05:22.990 --> 05:25.325
They don't just jam words in for fun.

05:25.366 --> 05:27.161
Julian thinks it's like a Fabio novel

05:27.202 --> 05:29.329
where you just skip around to the good parts.

05:29.370 --> 05:32.332
(Reading) "Drink 6 complimentary

05:29.370 --> 05:32.332
draught at the Swan pub.

05:32.373 --> 05:34.334
"You will be paid only

05:34.375 --> 05:36.962
if you're able to hold your piss for 6 hours."

05:37.004 --> 05:38.755
Tom: That can't be that hard.

05:38.797 --> 05:41.049
I can hold my piss for 12 fucking hours.

05:38.797 --> 05:41.049
6 draught, Ricky.

05:41.091 --> 05:42.759
I'm not drinking any draught.

05:41.091 --> 05:42.759
6 draught!

05:42.801 --> 05:44.803
I'm not drinking draught, boys.

05:42.801 --> 05:44.803
This is unbeliev...

05:44.845 --> 05:47.346
"Reshoot the cover of The Beatles'

05:44.845 --> 05:47.346
'Abbey Road', 25 dollars.

05:47.388 --> 05:49.975
"Or 1,000, if you can get a fucking...

05:50.017 --> 05:51.977
living Beatle in the picture."

05:52.019 --> 05:54.188
We can make a thousand bucks today?

05:52.019 --> 05:54.188
Tom: Yup.

05:54.229 --> 05:57.191
Yeah, Ricky, if we knew The Beatles, we could,

05:54.229 --> 05:57.191
which we do not.

05:57.232 --> 05:59.358
Well, that'll buy us some fucking drugs

05:57.232 --> 05:59.358
and some booze.

05:59.400 --> 06:01.195
Some food.

06:01.236 --> 06:04.198
"Retrieve a pair of Queen Elizabeth II's underwear

06:04.239 --> 06:05.782

06:05.824 --> 06:07.034
You've got to be fucking kidding me.

06:07.075 --> 06:08.827
No. It can't be that difficult.

06:08.869 --> 06:10.369
That... What do you mean! To get the

06:08.869 --> 06:10.369
Queen's underwear?

06:10.411 --> 06:12.206
Yeah. For fuck's sakes!

06:12.247 --> 06:13.414
Use your imagination.

06:14.833 --> 06:16.584
What the fuck is your deal?

06:14.833 --> 06:16.584
Who are you?

06:16.626 --> 06:18.795
I'm the fucking boss, dude. That's who I am.

06:18.837 --> 06:20.463
No, we're the fucking bosses.

06:18.837 --> 06:20.463
Yeah.

06:20.505 --> 06:22.257
All right. This is what we're going to do.

06:22.299 --> 06:24.218
We're going to get Noel Fielding's

06:22.299 --> 06:24.218
fucking autograph.

06:24.259 --> 06:26.220
We'll get 25 bucks, get some fucking drinks

06:26.261 --> 06:28.180
and some food and we'll figure

06:26.261 --> 06:28.180
this shit out.

06:28.222 --> 06:30.224
Let's get the fucking... go to The Swan and

06:28.222 --> 06:30.224
drink the beers first.

06:30.265 --> 06:32.391
I agree. I need a fucking buzz on.

06:30.265 --> 06:32.391
I'm not drinking draught.

06:32.433 --> 06:34.393
I am not drinking fucking draught, boys!

06:34.435 --> 06:35.645
Bubbles: This is fuckin'...

06:35.687 --> 06:36.897
This is awesome, Julian! Way to go!

06:36.938 --> 06:38.481
(Bump) Fuckin'... Jesus!

06:38.523 --> 06:40.317
(Banging) Julian:

06:38.523 --> 06:40.317
This isn't all my fault!

06:40.359 --> 06:41.943
Bubbles: Paid vacation in Europe

06:40.359 --> 06:41.943
is what you said.

06:41.985 --> 06:43.402
Ricky: Jesus Christ!

06:41.985 --> 06:43.402
Fucking asshole!

06:43.444 --> 06:44.821
Julian: That's what they

06:43.444 --> 06:44.821
fucking told me!

06:44.863 --> 06:46.073
Ricky: Fuck this bus!

06:44.863 --> 06:46.073
Jesus.

06:46.114 --> 06:48.116
Fuck you!

06:48.158 --> 06:50.618
This reminds me of that fucking movie

06:48.158 --> 06:50.618
In Malcolm John Cockovich!

06:50.660 --> 06:53.247
I was told we were going on a paid vacation.

06:53.288 --> 06:55.414
Now Julian's got everything fucked up and,

06:55.456 --> 06:57.251
if we want to get any money whatsoever,

06:57.292 --> 06:59.253
we've got to accomplish tasks!

06:59.294 --> 07:02.047
So all we can do is just try to do

06:59.294 --> 07:02.047
the easiest ones first

07:02.089 --> 07:05.050
and make enough money to eat.

07:05.092 --> 07:08.845
Apparently this place has been open 300 fucking years

07:08.887 --> 07:11.639
and this is where the sayings "one

07:08.887 --> 07:11.639
for the road"

07:11.681 --> 07:13.850
and "on the wagon" come from

07:13.892 --> 07:16.061
because this is where they used to drive by

07:16.103 --> 07:18.855
with the people on the wagon to go hang them.

07:18.897 --> 07:21.275
That's pretty fucked. This is the last place

07:18.897 --> 07:21.275
they could drink.

07:21.316 --> 07:23.068
This it here, The Swan?

07:23.110 --> 07:25.279
Yeah, this is it, according to this.

07:25.320 --> 07:27.697
It's a cool name. I like swans.

07:27.739 --> 07:30.075
Boys, I don't know how I'm going to drink six

07:27.739 --> 07:30.075
pints of fucking beer.

07:30.117 --> 07:31.659
I hate fucking beer.

07:31.701 --> 07:33.494
Suck it up. At least you're getting some

07:31.701 --> 07:33.494
alcohol.

07:33.536 --> 07:35.455
I need smoke in my lungs. I'm not complaining.

07:35.496 --> 07:37.457
Boys, we're on vacation. We're going to make

07:35.496 --> 07:37.457
a lot of money.

07:37.498 --> 07:39.084
Just party your fucking asses off!

07:39.126 --> 07:40.585
Let's do it.

07:40.627 --> 07:42.462
I can drink six beers and not piss,

07:40.627 --> 07:42.462
no problem.

07:42.503 --> 07:43.713
Even if I have to piss, I don't care.

07:43.755 --> 07:45.673
It's a free buzz on.

07:45.715 --> 07:47.301
Can I start before yours get here?

07:47.342 --> 07:49.136
Just get them in you, boys.

07:49.177 --> 07:51.096
I'd fucking... be embarrassed to be with

07:49.177 --> 07:51.096
someone that hairy.

07:51.138 --> 07:53.098
Holy fuck.

07:53.140 --> 07:55.100
What? Buddy's wife with

07:53.140 --> 07:55.100
the fucking hair.

07:55.142 --> 07:57.685
She needs a goddamn shave or something.

07:57.727 --> 07:59.479
A haircut. Ricky, are you joking?

07:59.520 --> 08:01.731
This? What?

08:01.773 --> 08:03.150
Look close, Ricky.

08:03.191 --> 08:04.901
You know that's not a person, right?

08:04.943 --> 08:06.694
Ah, fuck, okay. (Chuckling)

08:06.736 --> 08:08.488
I saw the hair...

08:08.529 --> 08:10.115
the fur dress...

08:10.157 --> 08:12.117
(Chuckles) Okay. No, it's...

08:12.159 --> 08:14.119
I mean, I don't know what it is, what is it?

08:14.161 --> 08:15.912
What do you... what do you think it is?

08:15.954 --> 08:18.039
Well, what stands on two legs, let's

08:15.954 --> 08:18.039
think about that?

08:19.374 --> 08:21.084
It could be a gristle bear'd?

08:21.126 --> 08:22.710
Both: A what?

08:22.752 --> 08:24.129
A kangarouge?

08:24.171 --> 08:26.173
"A gristle bear'd"?

08:26.214 --> 08:28.925
When have you ever seen a fucking black,

08:26.214 --> 08:28.925
hairy kangaroo, Ricky?

08:28.967 --> 08:30.344
So it's probably not that.

08:30.385 --> 08:31.803
A bird... has... stands on two legs,

08:31.845 --> 08:33.347
but I don't see any fucking wings,

08:33.388 --> 08:35.515
so let's... cross that off our list.

08:33.388 --> 08:35.515
A bird!

08:35.556 --> 08:37.517
A big, black fucking hairy bird

08:37.558 --> 08:39.269
with no wings?

08:39.311 --> 08:40.895
Giraffe? But I don't see any spots...

08:40.937 --> 08:42.481
Rick, it's a Newfoundland dog!

08:42.563 --> 08:44.358
We've got them back at home!

08:44.399 --> 08:46.401
What do you mean, Newfoundland dog?

08:44.399 --> 08:46.401
It's a big, fucking dog!

08:46.443 --> 08:48.362
There's no fucking dog that big!

08:46.443 --> 08:48.362
It's... That's a dog!

08:48.403 --> 08:50.530
If it was back home it'd be a Nova Scotia

08:48.403 --> 08:50.530
dog.

08:50.571 --> 08:51.948
Here you go, lads. Hey.

08:51.990 --> 08:53.533
Compliments of Swearnet. Thank you.

08:53.574 --> 08:55.369
I like the way you talk, it's English,

08:55.410 --> 08:57.162
but it's spokenly differently the way

08:55.410 --> 08:57.162
you do it!

08:57.204 --> 08:59.122
It's fucking cool. Man, I can't

08:57.204 --> 08:59.122
fucking do this.

08:59.164 --> 09:01.375
Julian, am I going to have to do some belly-work on you?

09:01.416 --> 09:03.377
Don't... get that thing... get it away from me.

09:03.418 --> 09:04.627
Up in the air, raise it up.

09:04.669 --> 09:06.380

09:14.221 --> 09:15.596
Ricky: Right on.

09:14.221 --> 09:15.596
Who's got your belly?

09:15.638 --> 09:16.973
Bubs, fuck off! Raise it up

09:17.015 --> 09:18.766

09:18.808 --> 09:21.561
Come on, Julian. You can chug one beer.

09:21.602 --> 09:23.397
You can chug one beer. Come on.

09:23.438 --> 09:24.981
I'll chug with you. Ricky:

To yours.

09:25.023 --> 09:26.691
I'll chug with you.

Boys, is the beer different over here?

11:52.795 --> 11:54.548
I drank 6 fucking beers and no buzz-on.

11:52.795 --> 11:54.548
No, it's...

11:54.589 --> 11:55.798
No, I don't either.

No, boys, that was non-alcoholic beer.

12:23.410 --> 12:25.119
(Imitating chimpanzee) Yeah?

Oh, it was a fairly normal day

12:40.677 --> 12:43.597

12:40.677 --> 12:43.597
of a fucking shed at us

12:43.638 --> 12:46.099
and then led us into what I perceived to be a kill room,

12:46.140 --> 12:47.766
which very well could have been.

13:29.058 --> 13:31.645
Although I do know where Noel is.

13:31.686 --> 13:33.647
So maybe I could take you to him.

13:33.688 --> 13:35.064
All right, that would be good.

13:35.106 --> 13:36.650
Let's get this going. Oh, goody.

13:36.691 --> 13:37.900
A little game.

13:37.942 --> 13:39.235
Come along, then, boys.

13:39.277 --> 13:41.820
Let's go and find Noel.

13:41.862 --> 13:44.031
Are you going to maybe put some pants on...?

13:44.073 --> 13:46.033
Pumpwhistle: I put my rubber pants on,

13:46.075 --> 13:48.202
the ones that Nanny gave me.

13:49.704 --> 13:51.830
Now, in order to find Noel,

13:51.872 --> 13:54.250
we'll have to take one of my private carriages.

13:54.292 --> 13:56.835
We may have to take a few detours.

13:56.877 --> 13:59.046
You see, you can never be sure where Noel is.

13:59.088 --> 14:00.674
Some say he's a shapeshifter...

14:00.715 --> 14:02.467
What? A shapeshifter.

14:02.509 --> 14:05.052
Others say he has the ability to turn into gas.

14:05.094 --> 14:06.721
Very difficult to pin down.

14:06.763 --> 14:09.474
I don't know if you've ever tried to pin gas before.

14:09.516 --> 14:10.849
Virtually impossible!

14:10.891 --> 14:12.477
Only Monkey managed it once

14:12.519 --> 14:15.062
when he was very high on opium.

14:15.104 --> 14:17.482
Anyway our carriage awaits, gentlemen!

14:17.524 --> 14:19.609
Monkey, lead the Canadian boys

14:19.651 --> 14:21.277
to the carriage!

14:21.319 --> 14:23.070
This is cool. I've never been in

14:21.319 --> 14:23.070
a private carriage.

14:23.112 --> 14:24.489
I haven't either.

14:24.531 --> 14:26.491
(Shouting) Just one...

14:24.531 --> 14:26.491
seco-o-o-ond!

14:26.533 --> 14:28.075
Ricky: Wow, is he ever powerful!

14:28.117 --> 14:30.286
Okay, boys, off we come to the

14:28.117 --> 14:30.286
private carriage.

14:30.328 --> 14:31.538
Ricky: Thank you.

14:31.579 --> 14:32.789
Thank you, my man.

14:32.831 --> 14:34.207
Any of these two will do.

14:34.248 --> 14:35.709
Ricky: These are yours?

14:34.248 --> 14:35.709
Well, yes.

14:35.750 --> 14:38.294
Most of the big ones like this I own.

14:38.336 --> 14:39.879
My father owns most of London.

14:39.920 --> 14:41.506
Some of these buildings here.

14:41.548 --> 14:42.716
This is awesome.

14:44.467 --> 14:46.302
I've never been on a double dunker.

14:44.467 --> 14:46.302
This is wicked!

14:46.344 --> 14:49.096
Ha ha! Double dunker! If you will!

14:49.138 --> 14:51.683
Julian: This fucking guy's driving?

14:49.138 --> 14:51.683
Are you kidding me?

14:51.725 --> 14:53.100
Can he drive?

14:53.142 --> 14:54.352
Oh, he'll be fine. (Honking)

14:54.394 --> 14:55.895
Monkey, get in your hatch.

14:55.936 --> 14:58.523
Come along, boys. No time to lose!

14:58.565 --> 15:00.525
Ricky: Look at the size

14:58.565 --> 15:00.525
of that fucking place.

15:00.567 --> 15:03.110
This is Westminster Abbey.

15:03.152 --> 15:05.321
A lot of people feel this is a building

15:05.363 --> 15:07.031
but most Londoners know

15:07.073 --> 15:09.909
that Westminster Abbey is in fact an insect.

15:09.950 --> 15:11.911
Ricky: Fuck off! Really?

15:11.952 --> 15:13.496
Ricky... Yes! True!

15:13.538 --> 15:14.997
No...

15:15.039 --> 15:16.916
It's not an insect. I was going to say.

15:16.957 --> 15:18.543
Like, how would it get around?

15:18.585 --> 15:19.794
It's huge!

15:19.836 --> 15:21.128
Pumpwhistle: The London Eye.

15:21.170 --> 15:23.130
Ricky: Holy fuck, is that ever cool!

15:23.172 --> 15:24.924
A big, giant Ferris cocksucker!

15:24.965 --> 15:26.551
Why is it called the London Eye?

15:26.593 --> 15:29.929
It's says that if the London Eye winks at you,

15:29.970 --> 15:32.348
you'll never be able to have children again.

15:32.390 --> 15:34.768
Oh... Better be careful, boys.

15:32.390 --> 15:34.768
(Chuckling)

15:34.809 --> 15:36.310
Ricky.

15:36.352 --> 15:38.938
Aslan, from "The Lion, The Witch And

15:36.352 --> 15:38.938
The Wardrobe".

15:38.979 --> 15:41.148
The first bisexual lion.

15:41.190 --> 15:44.360
He used to pack Turkish Delight

15:41.190 --> 15:44.360
into his anus

15:44.402 --> 15:46.153
with his huge claws

15:46.195 --> 15:48.406
and call for his mummy in the night times.

15:48.448 --> 15:50.366
(Sighing) Fu...

15:50.408 --> 15:52.368
Ricky: (Shouting) Do you know where Noel is?

15:52.410 --> 15:53.870
Does anybody know where Noel is?

15:53.912 --> 15:56.163
Because apparently Lord Pumperfucker

15:53.912 --> 15:56.163
doesn't!

15:56.205 --> 15:58.332
Has anybody seen Noel?

15:59.834 --> 16:01.961
Have you seen Noel?

16:02.002 --> 16:04.547
He's been gone for fucking ages!

16:05.632 --> 16:07.341
Ahhh, lady!

16:08.426 --> 16:10.386
I will lower down my pubes

16:10.428 --> 16:12.388
and you can climb up to the bus

16:12.430 --> 16:14.808
and tell us where Noel is!

16:14.849 --> 16:18.978
Ahhh, here we go! Wonderful!

16:19.019 --> 16:21.397
All right, are we going to get this autograph going or what?

16:21.439 --> 16:24.191
Yes, of course! I think you are

16:21.439 --> 16:24.191
Noel Fielding.

16:24.233 --> 16:26.611
Are you Noel? Are you just fucking around with us?

16:24.233 --> 16:26.611
No, no, my friend.

16:26.653 --> 16:28.613
Because, you know, we appreciate

16:26.653 --> 16:28.613
these costumes,

16:28.655 --> 16:30.615
little monkey boy, taking us around the town.

16:30.657 --> 16:33.200
Noel is very close. I can sense him.

16:33.242 --> 16:34.994
Perfect. Now, my muscular friend,

16:35.035 --> 16:37.413
all you need to do is have a little bit

16:35.035 --> 16:37.413
of patience

16:37.455 --> 16:39.624
and we'll skip away together like children

16:39.666 --> 16:42.418
in the afternoon mist and find Noel!

16:42.460 --> 16:44.420
We're having fun, I think you're cool...

16:44.462 --> 16:45.839
We just need the autograph, okay?

16:45.880 --> 16:47.423
I need to get some fucking food,

16:47.465 --> 16:49.300
I need some weed or hash, which you

16:47.465 --> 16:49.300
sort of promised.

16:49.342 --> 16:50.718
Okay, okay. Follow me.

16:50.760 --> 16:52.428
Ricky: So he's here?

16:50.760 --> 16:52.428
Follow me.

16:52.470 --> 16:53.847
Ricky: He is here, right?

16:52.470 --> 16:53.847
Of course he's here!

16:53.888 --> 16:55.264
Ricky: What about Mr. Monkey?

16:53.888 --> 16:55.264
Is Mr. Monkey...

16:55.306 --> 16:57.642
Oh, Monkey! Monkey! Monkey! Monkey!

16:57.684 --> 17:00.394
(Speaking gibberish)

17:04.273 --> 17:05.650
Bubbles: Boys...

17:05.692 --> 17:07.694
Now come along.

17:07.735 --> 17:11.030
I think we just stole a fucking bus, that's

17:07.735 --> 17:11.030
what happened.

17:11.071 --> 17:13.449
Follow me, boys! Not far to go!

17:13.491 --> 17:15.869
Ricky: Boys, what in the fuck

17:13.491 --> 17:15.869
is going on here?

17:15.910 --> 17:17.662
I'm telling you, the guy with the hair,

17:17.704 --> 17:19.246
that is Noel Fielding.

17:19.288 --> 17:20.665
Are you sure?

17:20.707 --> 17:22.458
Lord Pumpwhistle is Noel Fielding.

17:22.500 --> 17:23.710
Let's get his signature, then,

17:23.751 --> 17:25.586
and go get some fucking food.

17:25.628 --> 17:27.588
Bubbles: I didn't know he was this

17:25.628 --> 17:27.588
fucked, I'll be honest.

17:27.630 --> 17:29.465
Julian: Noel, Noel!

17:29.507 --> 17:31.258
All right, enough with this fucking around.

17:31.300 --> 17:32.844
I want a signature, right now.

17:34.053 --> 17:35.930
Right on... what the fuck?

17:35.972 --> 17:38.265
And I'm not buying this whole monkey

17:35.972 --> 17:38.265
shit, all right?

17:38.307 --> 17:40.059
I'm getting really sick of following this guy around,

17:40.100 --> 17:41.686
no pants on, a weird wig and a little friend

17:41.728 --> 17:43.312
who thinks he's a fucking monkey!

17:43.354 --> 17:45.481
I don't know where this Noel guy is,

17:45.523 --> 17:47.817
but he's nowhere they're saying he is

17:45.523 --> 17:47.817
and it's driving me crazy.

17:47.859 --> 17:49.986
He wasn't at the goddamn horse, which

17:47.859 --> 17:49.986
is the dumbest statue

17:50.028 --> 17:51.988
I've ever seen in my fucking life!

17:50.028 --> 17:51.988
He's not anywhere!

17:52.030 --> 17:53.406
Ricky: Let's just go do

17:52.030 --> 17:53.406
something else.

17:53.447 --> 17:54.824
What else is on the list?

17:54.866 --> 17:56.868
You know what? Let's go to Abbey Road.

17:58.953 --> 18:00.329
Bubbles: Fuck, boys, that's it!

18:00.371 --> 18:01.706
That's it right, there. Right there.

18:01.748 --> 18:03.499
Right on. Noel:

18:01.748 --> 18:03.499
Abbey Road.

18:03.541 --> 18:05.710
Bubbles: That's where The Beatles

18:03.541 --> 18:05.710
recorded all the stuff!

18:05.752 --> 18:07.712
Abbey Road is powerful. Big deal.

18:07.754 --> 18:09.923
So what the fuck is this picture we've

18:07.754 --> 18:09.923
got to re-create?

18:09.964 --> 18:11.716
It's the cross-walk picture, Ricky.

18:11.758 --> 18:13.718
You know, where The Beatles go across.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.720
If we do that we get 25 bucks.

18:15.762 --> 18:17.430
We get a picture on a crosswalk, 25 bucks!

18:17.471 --> 18:19.515
We should have did that long ago

18:19.557 --> 18:22.101
instead of following around Lord Fuckedinthehead

18:19.557 --> 18:22.101
and Monkey Man!

18:22.142 --> 18:24.311
Well, 25... I mean a thousand if we did it

18:24.353 --> 18:26.731
with a living Beatle but obviously

18:24.353 --> 18:26.731
we can't do that.

18:26.773 --> 18:28.524
That's not going to happen.

18:26.773 --> 18:28.524
Whoa, a living beetle?

18:28.566 --> 18:30.777
That's easy!

18:30.818 --> 18:32.737
No, Ricky... There's probably some

18:30.818 --> 18:32.737
fucking beetles in here.

18:32.779 --> 18:34.363
No, no, not... not insects, Ricky.

18:34.405 --> 18:35.615
The band, The Beatles.

18:35.656 --> 18:37.533
Somebody from the band, The Beatles.

18:37.575 --> 18:40.160
How in the fuck can you live on Planet Earth

18:40.202 --> 18:42.288
and not know who The Beatles are?

18:43.790 --> 18:45.374
Do you want to take our picture for us?

18:45.416 --> 18:47.418
Make it look like The Beatles, all right?

18:47.460 --> 18:49.336
Okay, you should go first because John Lennon

18:47.460 --> 18:49.336
was in the front

18:49.378 --> 18:51.171
with his white suit. Ricky:

18:49.378 --> 18:51.171
Where do you want me, Bubs?

18:51.213 --> 18:52.757
Maybe you could be Ringo.

18:52.799 --> 18:54.550
Where am I? Ricky:

18:52.799 --> 18:54.550
What are we going to do?

18:54.592 --> 18:56.010
Bubbles: I'll be McCartney.

18:56.052 --> 18:57.762
Ringo, McCartney, George.

18:56.052 --> 18:57.762
Ricky: Okay.

18:57.804 --> 18:59.764
Monkey, you be uh... you be Monkey!

18:59.806 --> 19:01.015
All right, let's just do this.

19:01.057 --> 19:02.349
Let's go! Let's go! Ah-ha!

19:02.391 --> 19:04.769
The first Welsh Beatles!

19:04.811 --> 19:06.145
Let's move it. Let's go.

19:06.186 --> 19:08.355
Ricky: So we just...

19:06.186 --> 19:08.355
Okay...

19:08.397 --> 19:11.525
Bubbles: Everybody get your legs

19:08.397 --> 19:11.525
going, just look over here for one second.

19:14.194 --> 19:15.780
All right, we're done. There we go.

19:15.822 --> 19:17.406
Let's go. That's it?

19:17.448 --> 19:19.575
Can I have the phone back?

19:17.448 --> 19:19.575
There we go.

19:19.617 --> 19:21.786
Let's see... That looks pretty good.

19:21.828 --> 19:23.997
We got it, let's go.

19:24.038 --> 19:25.790
Ricky: Oh, fuck, boys,

19:24.038 --> 19:25.790
I've got to piss.

19:25.832 --> 19:27.792
I can't hold it. My piss went away.

19:27.834 --> 19:30.169
I'm like a camel.

19:30.210 --> 19:31.420
Yeah, I've got to piss.

19:31.462 --> 19:32.839
No, no, Ricky, don't piss, man.

19:32.880 --> 19:34.632
Boys, we didn't even get a buzz on.

19:34.674 --> 19:36.009
How the fuck are they gonna

19:34.674 --> 19:36.009
know if we pissed or not?

19:36.050 --> 19:37.677
I'm pissing!

19:37.718 --> 19:39.595
Well, you're not getting any of my

19:37.718 --> 19:39.595
liquor money, man.

19:39.637 --> 19:41.597
Oh, fuck!

19:41.639 --> 19:45.392
(Trickling) (Sighing)

19:45.434 --> 19:46.769
Jesus Christ!

19:49.229 --> 19:51.190
Nice dick. Oh, fuck!

19:51.231 --> 19:52.984
Oh, yeah, fuck, that's great.

19:51.231 --> 19:52.984
For fuck's sakes.

19:53.026 --> 19:54.819
Tom: Scratch that one

19:53.026 --> 19:54.819
off the list, bud.

19:54.861 --> 19:56.195
I'll see you boys back at the bus.

19:56.236 --> 19:57.446
Bubbles: Way to go, Ricky.

19:57.488 --> 19:58.698
For fuck's sakes!

19:58.739 --> 20:00.574
(Sighing) Nice one.

20:02.785 --> 20:04.244
Ricky, for fuck's sakes!

20:04.286 --> 20:05.830
Sorry, boys. I'll fucking make up for it.

20:05.872 --> 20:07.081
What else is on the list?

20:07.123 --> 20:08.833
Well, there's just this...

20:08.875 --> 20:11.627
Buckingham Palace thing but we can't fucking do that.

20:11.669 --> 20:13.462
Ricky: Why not?

20:13.504 --> 20:14.881
Do you know where the Fucking Palace is?

20:14.922 --> 20:17.633
I certainly do! Perhaps Noel will be there.

20:17.675 --> 20:19.844
He sometimes frequents the Palace.

20:19.886 --> 20:22.388
Ricky: Perfect.

20:19.886 --> 20:22.388
Follow me, boys!

20:22.429 --> 20:23.806
Ricky, don't...

20:23.848 --> 20:25.432
You're wiping your piss-hands on me!

20:25.474 --> 20:26.851
I know what you're doing.

20:25.474 --> 20:26.851
No I wasn't.

20:26.893 --> 20:28.061
No, I wasn't.

20:29.145 --> 20:32.857
(Military music)

20:32.899 --> 20:35.860
Bubbles: If we did get in there,

20:32.899 --> 20:35.860
do you know where her quarters would be?

20:35.902 --> 20:38.196
This area here is where the panties live.

20:39.279 --> 20:40.489
Which area?

20:40.531 --> 20:42.075
This area here...

20:42.116 --> 20:43.868
is where the panties live.

20:43.910 --> 20:45.661
Monkey, go find him! (Yelling)

20:45.703 --> 20:47.287
Okay, I'm going in to get the fucking underwear,

20:47.329 --> 20:48.706
one of you guys has to come with me,

20:48.748 --> 20:49.957
I need someone to make a distraction.

20:49.999 --> 20:51.792
I'm not getting in with this.

20:51.834 --> 20:53.711
Well, I'm not going in with one of those

20:51.834 --> 20:53.711
two fucking weirdos.

20:53.753 --> 20:55.546
You can't... Can't you just set it down?

20:55.588 --> 20:58.091
Set it down? People steal shit around here, okay?

20:58.132 --> 21:00.259
So I'm supposed to go into the fucking

20:58.132 --> 21:00.259
Palace with him?

21:00.300 --> 21:03.262
Who else is going to fucking go in, Bubs?

21:00.300 --> 21:03.262
Who else is going to go in?

21:03.303 --> 21:05.056
Maybe you should take fucking Lord Weirdsy with you?

21:05.098 --> 21:06.682
You're not taking him!

21:06.724 --> 21:08.308
Me and you, we've got this. How hard can it be

21:08.350 --> 21:09.894
to get a pair of her fucking underwear?

21:09.936 --> 21:13.106
Yeah, so, just about to break into

21:09.936 --> 21:13.106
Buckingham Palace

21:13.147 --> 21:14.899
with Ricky here, no big deal.

21:14.941 --> 21:17.317
We're just going to steal the royal undergarments,

21:17.359 --> 21:19.153
no big deal whatsoever.

21:19.195 --> 21:22.073
Couldn't go to jail forever. Fucking police everywhere!

21:26.160 --> 21:27.369
Hello!

21:27.411 --> 21:29.747
Is it just... uh... paintings and...

21:29.789 --> 21:31.331
There's no...

21:31.373 --> 21:33.126
jewellery or any of that...?

21:33.167 --> 21:34.919
Umm... there's a couple of pieces of jewellery, yeah.

21:34.961 --> 21:37.296
Umm... some floral jewellery.

21:37.337 --> 21:38.756
It's just in that gallery.

21:38.798 --> 21:41.300
And there's some little works by Fabergé,

21:41.341 --> 21:43.510
as well, little flowers, yeah.

21:43.552 --> 21:45.345
Cool. All right, thank you.

21:45.387 --> 21:47.265
(Mixed chatter)

21:49.349 --> 21:50.559
(Whispering) Okay, Ricky,

21:50.601 --> 21:52.270
so we're in Buckingham Palace.

21:53.353 --> 21:55.106
(Singsonging)

21:55.148 --> 21:56.941
We've got to break away from the rest of these people.

21:56.983 --> 21:58.776
Oh wow, big paintings,

21:58.818 --> 22:01.320
big... rugs... mats...

21:58.818 --> 22:01.320
Ricky...

22:01.361 --> 22:02.738
Ricky. What?

22:02.780 --> 22:05.491
These are treasures of the land.

22:06.867 --> 22:10.329
I don't get it, Bubs. Although...

22:10.370 --> 22:13.624
One of these is probably worth a lot more

22:10.370 --> 22:13.624
than the underwear.

22:13.666 --> 22:16.961
Fuck, no, Ricky. You're not taking one

22:13.666 --> 22:16.961
of the tapestries.

22:17.003 --> 22:19.172
I could roll that up?

22:19.213 --> 22:22.133
You can't roll that up like just rolling up

22:19.213 --> 22:22.133
an old rug.

22:22.175 --> 22:23.717
Well, we should take a little, tiny painting.

22:23.759 --> 22:25.343
Look at these little, small ones here.

22:25.385 --> 22:26.971
I could fit those in my pants.

22:27.013 --> 22:28.597
You don't think they're going to notice

22:28.639 --> 22:30.308
a fucking blank spot on the wall with a hook?

22:31.809 --> 22:33.769
Do you know who Noel Fielding is?

22:31.809 --> 22:33.769
Yeah.

22:33.811 --> 22:35.271
Is that him right there? Man:

22:33.811 --> 22:35.271
That's him.

22:35.313 --> 22:36.605
Are you sure? Definitely.

22:36.647 --> 22:38.024
Look here... Noel...

22:38.065 --> 22:39.859
Noel, stop fucking around with me, okay?

22:39.900 --> 22:42.987
All I want... Noel, all I want is your

22:39.900 --> 22:42.987
autograph on my hand.

22:43.029 --> 22:44.530
That's all I want, then you guys can go off

22:44.571 --> 22:45.990
and do whatever the fuck you want.

22:46.032 --> 22:47.908
Monkey, deal with this.

22:47.950 --> 22:49.785
Are you fucking kidding me?

22:49.827 --> 22:52.370
(In low voice) If I take this elevator

22:49.827 --> 22:52.370
here up to the third floor,

22:52.412 --> 22:55.582
it doesn't look there's anything

22:52.412 --> 22:55.582
in between here and this laundry zone.

22:55.624 --> 22:56.959
This looks pretty easy.

22:59.045 --> 23:00.921
Trust me, this'll be easy,

22:59.045 --> 23:00.921
I got this.

23:00.963 --> 23:03.007
(Whispering) Listen to me. Are you

23:00.963 --> 23:03.007
even listening to me?

23:03.049 --> 23:05.592
There's undercover people.

23:05.634 --> 23:07.594
MI6. Oh, yeah?

23:07.636 --> 23:10.597
Yes. Like James Bond types walking around.

23:10.639 --> 23:12.350
All right. I'll try to be careful.

23:14.268 --> 23:16.354
We're fucked. We're fucked.

23:26.280 --> 23:28.115
(Whispering) MI6...

23:28.157 --> 23:31.077
(Mixed chatter)

23:43.463 --> 23:45.841
(Exhaling)

23:45.883 --> 23:47.593
Just here to look at the paintings...

23:49.469 --> 23:51.471
Just looking around like a regular person.

23:52.890 --> 23:55.268
One of the kings had a big barbecue one time.

23:55.309 --> 23:57.644
A big blowout. So they made a painting of it.

23:57.686 --> 23:59.855
See, all the smoke's there?

23:59.897 --> 24:02.233
And the chickens and stuff they were cooking.

24:05.319 --> 24:07.445
We haven't eaten since we left Sunnyvale

24:07.487 --> 24:10.074
and I'm about to faint, I'm so hungry.

24:10.116 --> 24:13.077
If Ricky pulls this off, we get a thousand bucks.

24:13.119 --> 24:15.662
We can live like kings for a thousand bucks.

24:17.539 --> 24:19.875
Get it? Live like kings, and I'm in Buckingham Palace.

24:21.377 --> 24:23.087
This is the only way to the third floor.

24:23.129 --> 24:25.256
It's closed. You're going to have to wait here.

24:31.345 --> 24:33.306
I'm thinking I might just take off.

24:33.347 --> 24:36.309
Ricky's been gone for 25 minutes.

24:33.347 --> 24:36.309
I'm freaking out!

24:36.350 --> 24:38.311
I don't know what I'm going to do.

24:38.352 --> 24:39.561
(Sighing)

24:39.603 --> 24:41.147
I think they're on to us...

24:41.188 --> 24:42.689
The chicken has landed, the chicken has landed.

24:42.731 --> 24:43.941
We've got to go now. Somebody saw me.

24:43.983 --> 24:45.318
Oh, my fuck!

24:45.359 --> 24:48.904
(Mixed chatter)

24:48.946 --> 24:50.114
(Indistinct)

24:58.538 --> 25:00.707
Holy fuck! It's fine, Bubs.

24:58.538 --> 25:00.707
We're good.

25:00.749 --> 25:02.126
We're good.

25:02.168 --> 25:03.710
Freaking out!

25:03.752 --> 25:05.712
You got them? I've got them, yeah.

25:05.754 --> 25:08.174
(Horse hooves clopping)

25:10.550 --> 25:12.136
We've got to go. We've got to go right now.

25:12.178 --> 25:13.679
We've got to go. We've got to go.

25:13.720 --> 25:15.931
He got them, he got the Queen's underwear.

25:15.973 --> 25:17.515
Are we still getting the autograph?

25:17.557 --> 25:19.935
Julian: Fuck the autograph!

25:19.977 --> 25:22.938
Bubbles: Boys, let's just get

25:19.977 --> 25:22.938
the fuck on the bus. I'm freaking out.

25:22.980 --> 25:24.940
I still feel like the guards are following us.

25:24.982 --> 25:26.524
Julian: Nobody's following us.

25:24.982 --> 25:26.524
We're good, boys.

25:26.566 --> 25:28.027
Fucking made it. All right, boys,

25:28.068 --> 25:29.820
how did you do today on your tasks?

25:28.068 --> 25:29.820
Good.

25:29.862 --> 25:31.822
Did you get Noel Fielding's

25:29.862 --> 25:31.822
autograph?

25:31.864 --> 25:34.116
Not exactly. He wouldn't even admit

25:31.864 --> 25:34.116
he was Noel Fielding.

25:34.158 --> 25:35.742
You were with him all fucking day

25:35.784 --> 25:37.161
and you didn't get his autograph?

25:37.203 --> 25:38.536
He's out of his fucking mind!

25:38.578 --> 25:40.538
The guy's a fucking lunatic.

25:40.580 --> 25:43.376
We already know you fucked up

25:40.580 --> 25:43.376
the drinking and fucking pissing.

25:43.417 --> 25:44.960
Check that out.

25:45.002 --> 25:46.962
We got the album cover.

25:47.004 --> 25:48.964
Ha ha! Ricky:

25:47.004 --> 25:48.964
Let's go, pay up!

25:49.006 --> 25:51.717
Last time I checked there was no Mexican

25:49.006 --> 25:51.717
horse jockey in The Beatles.

25:51.758 --> 25:53.511
Julian: What?

25:53.551 --> 25:55.388
Bubbles: Monkey's in the shot.

25:53.551 --> 25:55.388
Oh, my fuck, Ricky!

25:55.429 --> 25:56.847
Monkey was right behind you, for fuck's sakes!

25:56.889 --> 25:58.516
Oh, it's my fault? It's your fault!

25:58.556 --> 26:00.393
You should have been fucking on Monkeywatch,

25:58.556 --> 26:00.393
you dumbass!

26:00.434 --> 26:02.395
Fuck you, Julian! Well, guess what?

26:00.434 --> 26:02.395
I came through.

26:02.436 --> 26:04.397
Maybe I won't give you any of my

26:02.436 --> 26:04.397
fucking money for food!

26:04.438 --> 26:06.315
Tom: Oh, you've got

26:04.438 --> 26:06.315
the Queen's underwear?

26:06.357 --> 26:08.108
Congratulations. One pair of the Queen's

26:06.357 --> 26:08.108
fucking panties,

26:08.150 --> 26:09.360
right out of her washing machine.

26:09.402 --> 26:10.736
That's right. Pay up!

26:11.820 --> 26:13.989
The fuck does that say?

26:14.031 --> 26:15.408
Ricky: It's the company that

26:14.031 --> 26:15.408
makes them, I guess.

26:15.449 --> 26:16.825
I don't fucking know.

26:16.867 --> 26:18.285
Ricky, are you kidding me?

26:16.867 --> 26:18.285
What?

26:18.327 --> 26:19.995
Ricky, you stole Prince Charles'

26:18.327 --> 26:19.995
underwear!

26:20.037 --> 26:21.997
The Queen wouldn't fit in those!

26:22.039 --> 26:23.790
It's not Prince Charles'. There's lace all over them!

26:23.832 --> 26:25.418
That's the company that makes them.

26:25.459 --> 26:29.046
It's not... the Queen's.

26:25.459 --> 26:29.046
Oh, Ricky!

26:29.088 --> 26:30.464
Look, that's the...

26:30.506 --> 26:32.425
Why would the Queen have a piss-hole, Ricky?

26:32.466 --> 26:34.592
That's where the royal wiener

26:32.466 --> 26:34.592
comes out!

26:34.634 --> 26:36.803
Nice going, Rick. Nice fucking going!

26:36.845 --> 26:38.596
You were there, for fuck's sakes!

26:38.638 --> 26:40.224
Why didn't you just grab a bunch of them?

26:40.266 --> 26:41.599
At least I tried.

26:41.641 --> 26:43.436
Well, you fucking failed, didn't you?

26:43.477 --> 26:45.229
Wheels up in two hours.

26:45.271 --> 26:47.231
Fuck, man, you've got to give us some food.

26:47.273 --> 26:48.815
Tom: No. You've got to earn it.

26:48.857 --> 26:50.608
(Chuckle) Thanks a lot, buddy!

26:50.650 --> 26:52.236
Tom: Have a nice day.

26:50.650 --> 26:52.236
Thanks a lot!

26:52.278 --> 26:54.029
This is getting fucking serious, boys!

26:54.071 --> 26:56.031
Yeah, awesome trip you took us on here.

26:56.073 --> 26:58.033
"Oh we're going to party our asses off.

26:56.073 --> 26:58.033
Food and women and booze

26:58.075 --> 27:00.035
and drugs!" And this...

26:58.075 --> 27:00.035
This is my fault, huh?

27:00.077 --> 27:01.828
This is all my fault? Pretty much.

27:01.870 --> 27:03.621
No, you guys go fuck yourselves!

27:03.663 --> 27:06.041
You guys deal with the contracts

27:03.663 --> 27:06.041
from now on, okay?

27:06.083 --> 27:08.461
You said it was going to be awesome

27:08.502 --> 27:10.837
and now we're stranded in fucking Europe

27:10.879 --> 27:12.465
with no goddamn money!

27:12.506 --> 27:14.425
We could starve to death.

27:12.506 --> 27:14.425
I know.

27:14.467 --> 27:16.343
We could starve to death. We're not going...

27:16.385 --> 27:18.262
We're going to have to fucking turn

27:16.385 --> 27:18.262
into Mantracker!

27:18.304 --> 27:19.805
We're not going to starve to death!

27:19.846 --> 27:21.639
Survival of the fittest, it's going to be!

27:21.681 --> 27:23.476
I'll figure this out, okay?

27:23.517 --> 27:25.852
You fucking better. Bubbles:

27:23.517 --> 27:25.852
Fuck's sakes!

27:25.894 --> 27:27.980
I'm going to fucking bum some cigarettes,

27:25.894 --> 27:27.980
you fucking idiots!

27:29.315 --> 27:30.483
Fuck you, Ricky!

27:33.902 --> 27:35.862
Fucking asshole.

27:35.904 --> 27:37.655
(Beeping)

27:37.697 --> 27:39.492
Can you guys please stop fucking filming me?

27:39.533 --> 27:40.909
(Beeping)

27:40.951 --> 27:43.661
What the fuck is the combination?

27:43.703 --> 27:45.498
What's the combination?

27:45.539 --> 27:47.082
Man: 1-7-9-9.

27:47.124 --> 27:48.334
(Sighing)

27:48.375 --> 27:51.504
(Beeping)

27:51.545 --> 27:53.506
Great!

27:53.547 --> 27:54.714
Fuck's sakes!
