WEBVTT

00:18.318 --> 00:19.551
Gentlemen, three months ago,

00:19.553 --> 00:21.153
I bravely re-entered
the dating pool.

00:21.155 --> 00:22.988
And how has this city
rewarded me?

00:22.990 --> 00:25.290
With an endless parade
of weirdo ass clowns.

00:25.292 --> 00:27.192
Hard to say who was the worst.

00:27.194 --> 00:28.861
Comedy magician.
No, it's the guy
with the little ding-ding.

00:28.863 --> 00:30.996
The lion tamer.
Never went out
with a lion tamer.

00:30.998 --> 00:33.232
Then I am having
some vivid dreams.

00:33.234 --> 00:34.500
The point is,

00:34.502 --> 00:36.502
Ian has asked me out
on a third date.

00:36.504 --> 00:38.804
Ooh.
- And this is the biggest
compliment I could give:

00:38.806 --> 00:40.672
I want to go.

00:40.674 --> 00:42.808
Because I like him.
Boo.

00:42.810 --> 00:44.810
That's not a reason.
And, frankly, it's been a while.

00:44.812 --> 00:46.178
And the third date is where

00:46.180 --> 00:49.048
¶ Mama gets her biscuit. ¶
(chuckles)

00:49.050 --> 00:51.717
Mama gets her biscuit.
I don't understand.

00:51.719 --> 00:53.385
It's sex.
Oh!

00:53.387 --> 00:54.887
Yeah!
- Now, that's a reason!

00:54.889 --> 00:56.155
Anyway, I'm bringing him
home tonight,

00:56.157 --> 00:58.157
so let's keep
those toilets flushed.

00:58.159 --> 01:01.026
That means stick around.
Take a second look.

01:01.028 --> 01:03.095
How'd you tell Ian about
the fun surprise that
you still live with your ex?

01:03.097 --> 01:04.229
All right.

01:04.231 --> 01:05.431
Well, I haven't told him yet.

01:05.433 --> 01:06.999
Uh, tricky conversation.

01:07.001 --> 01:08.901
I'm thinking
of something simple like,

01:08.903 --> 01:11.236
"Hey, Ian, I live with my ex."

01:11.238 --> 01:13.572
No. No, no. When a guy
hears that, he is going to

01:13.574 --> 01:15.407
run through the wall
like the Kool-Aid Man.

01:15.409 --> 01:17.743
Here's a fun idea. You can put
a hat on him with antlers.

01:17.745 --> 01:22.414
This way, the hole he makes in
the wall will make us all smile.

01:22.416 --> 01:23.916
Nick brings home girls
all the time.

01:23.918 --> 01:25.717
There's no problem.
No complaints here.

01:25.719 --> 01:27.453
It'll make you forget
every botanical garden

01:27.455 --> 01:28.921
you've ever seen.

01:28.923 --> 01:30.155
I live with my ex-girlfriend.

01:31.224 --> 01:33.025
And after the
farmer's market...

01:33.027 --> 01:34.359
I live with my ex.

01:35.261 --> 01:36.261
Let's have sex again.

01:36.263 --> 01:37.362
I live with my ex.

01:37.364 --> 01:39.364
(sighs)

01:39.366 --> 01:40.899
Damn it. Too quick.

01:40.901 --> 01:42.568
Hey, if you're looking
to scare somebody off,

01:42.570 --> 01:44.203
it's basically a gold mine.

01:44.205 --> 01:46.605
Nobody cares that we're exes
who live together.

01:46.607 --> 01:48.674
(groans)
I got to go.

01:49.709 --> 01:51.610
Okay, that doesn't
prove anything.

01:51.612 --> 01:53.946
Just for the record, I'm leaving
'cause you live with your ex.

01:53.948 --> 01:56.115
It's gross.
And disgusting.

01:56.117 --> 01:58.417
And I'm gonna steal some stuff.

01:58.419 --> 01:59.785
Take what you want, honey.

01:59.787 --> 02:01.887
COACH:
We don't read those anymore.

02:03.490 --> 02:04.923
(door closes)

02:04.925 --> 02:08.327
Nick, who are these girls?

02:08.329 --> 02:10.229
They're not the best.

02:16.002 --> 02:19.238
Jess, guys hate
complicated situations.

02:19.240 --> 02:21.673
We want the path
of least resistance.

02:21.675 --> 02:24.276
There's a flap in our underwear
because we are too lazy

02:24.278 --> 02:25.944
to pull our underpants down.

02:25.946 --> 02:27.813
No offense, Nick, but...

02:27.815 --> 02:30.749
Ian's a little different from
you or the women you bring home.

02:30.751 --> 02:32.651
The... tavern folk.

02:32.653 --> 02:35.154
Have some respect.
They're called Uh-Ohs.

02:35.156 --> 02:38.123
And I've been through a lot
of names: Pork Pals,
- Mm-hmm.

02:38.125 --> 02:39.424
Okay.
- Bone Cronies,

02:39.426 --> 02:41.160
Right.
- C-Plussy Hussies.

02:41.162 --> 02:41.860
Very reverent.
But "Uh-Oh"

02:41.862 --> 02:43.262
takes it off of them

02:43.264 --> 02:45.197
and back onto me
where it belongs.

02:45.199 --> 02:47.332
I made the mistake, not them.
They're great.

02:47.334 --> 02:49.301
You really are a prince
among men, Nick.

02:49.303 --> 02:51.203
Aw, that's awfully nice.
I feel like I'm maturing.

02:51.205 --> 02:52.671
All I'm saying is that, somehow,

02:52.673 --> 02:55.107
Ian is even more mature
than you are.

02:55.109 --> 02:57.009
And that's why I think
he'll understand

02:57.011 --> 03:00.445
when I tell him in a mature
adult way, I live with my ex,

03:00.447 --> 03:01.880
but there's nothing
to worry about.

03:01.882 --> 03:04.116
Can I suggest a tweak?
Fine.

03:04.118 --> 03:05.884
"I live with my ex, but
there's nothing to worry about

03:05.886 --> 03:07.286
because he's gay now."
No.

03:07.288 --> 03:09.188
"Because he has weeks to live."
No.

03:09.190 --> 03:11.290
"Because he's already dead."

03:11.292 --> 03:13.225
What?
- Then I'll act like a ghost.

03:13.227 --> 03:14.860
No.

03:14.862 --> 03:16.328
(imitating ghost):
Consider it.

03:16.330 --> 03:19.064
No.
- Come on.

03:19.066 --> 03:20.732
That's the worst ghost
impression I've ever heard.

03:20.734 --> 03:22.701
This is the worst ghost
impression you've ever heard?

03:22.703 --> 03:25.003
(imitating ghost):
I'm a ghost.

03:25.005 --> 03:27.539
(scoffs)
There's way worse.

03:27.541 --> 03:28.874
(Winston humming softly)

03:28.876 --> 03:30.742
Anything for me?

03:30.744 --> 03:32.711
Oh, no, this isn't our mail.
This is our neighbors' mail.

03:32.713 --> 03:34.713
You see, Viv likes it
alphabetized.

03:34.715 --> 03:37.883
Yet Michelle likes it
according to size. (chuckles)

03:37.885 --> 03:39.051
Hashtag "go figure," right?

03:39.053 --> 03:40.686
Hashtag "did you see
how I rhymed?"

03:40.688 --> 03:42.187
I want to choke you
until your eyes

03:42.189 --> 03:43.922
literally pop out
of your head.

03:43.924 --> 03:46.558
Those girls are not
going to sleep with you.

03:46.560 --> 03:49.861
They are hot. And nothing is
less hot than a male secretary.

03:49.863 --> 03:52.397
(imitates record scratching)

03:52.399 --> 03:53.732
What?

03:53.734 --> 03:55.734
I think somebody needs
to take a good long look

03:55.736 --> 03:58.904
at Defense<i> Secretary</i>
Chuck Hagel.

03:58.906 --> 04:00.572
Dude's eyes are so pouchy,

04:00.574 --> 04:03.408
he can barely see anything,
and he's still killing it.

04:03.410 --> 04:06.778
Girls don't have sex with
guys who sort their mail.

04:06.780 --> 04:09.715
Look, I am playing
the long game here, Coach,

04:09.717 --> 04:12.517
weaving myself into the
fabric of their lives.

04:12.519 --> 04:14.119
Pretty soon I'll
be as permanent

04:14.121 --> 04:17.189
as the will that I
helped them draw up.

04:17.191 --> 04:19.224
Oh, Winston, thank
God you're here.

04:19.226 --> 04:20.726
The toilet won't flush.

04:20.728 --> 04:21.760
Did you jiggle the handle?

04:21.762 --> 04:23.128
No, it's not
working for us.

04:23.130 --> 04:25.330
Here.
- Oh.

04:26.966 --> 04:28.467
I'm not here to do any chores.

04:28.469 --> 04:30.235
You guys want
to hang out tonight?

04:30.237 --> 04:31.603
Sure.
- Sure.
- Right on.

04:31.605 --> 04:32.904
Right on. That's what's up.

04:32.906 --> 04:35.741
WINSTON: Coach, I really need
my stilts and a plunger!

04:35.743 --> 04:38.243
Eh, I don't care.

04:38.245 --> 04:39.811
I'm happy
to lend you a bra,

04:39.813 --> 04:41.813
but I don't think I have
anything that would fit you.

04:41.815 --> 04:43.282
That's the Peter Pan.

04:43.284 --> 04:44.916
That'll smash 'em down good,

04:44.918 --> 04:46.151
but you'll never
get those in there.

04:46.153 --> 04:47.419
I know. I just wanted to see

04:47.421 --> 04:48.987
what it would feel like
to be your size.

04:48.989 --> 04:50.822
Are we doing, like,
a boob<i> Freaky Friday?</i>

04:50.824 --> 04:53.992
Because I don't want to lug
yours around. They're a load.

04:53.994 --> 04:55.894
I know. That's the whole point.
That's why all the women

04:55.896 --> 04:57.162
in my family have back trouble,
you know?

04:57.164 --> 04:58.263
(groans)

04:58.265 --> 04:59.965
So, now that I have
insurance, though,

04:59.967 --> 05:01.300
I was thinking
maybe I could have, like,

05:01.302 --> 05:02.668
breast reduction surgery.

05:02.670 --> 05:04.303
SCHMIDT (in distance):
No!

05:04.305 --> 05:06.571
(footsteps running)

05:06.573 --> 05:09.141
(frantic knocking)
I wonder who this is.

05:09.143 --> 05:11.009
What?

05:12.178 --> 05:13.645
It's a boob reduction, Schmidt.

05:13.647 --> 05:14.980
Just accept it.

05:14.982 --> 05:16.648
Acceptance is stage five.

05:16.650 --> 05:18.984
I'm grieving, Cece.
There are five stages of grief.

05:18.986 --> 05:20.919
Stage one was denial.

05:20.921 --> 05:22.287
This is not happening,
this is not happening.
Yes, it is. Yes, it is.

05:22.289 --> 05:23.355
You're not getting
a boob reduction.
Yes, I am.

05:23.357 --> 05:24.323
This is not happening.
Yes, it is.

05:24.325 --> 05:25.691
Stage two was anger.

05:25.693 --> 05:27.092
Your breasts belong
to all of us!

05:27.094 --> 05:28.327
Okay.

05:28.329 --> 05:29.461
Who are you to decide?!

05:29.463 --> 05:31.263
Next will be stage
four, depression.

05:31.265 --> 05:32.931
And then stage
five, acceptance.

05:32.933 --> 05:35.434
But right now, I'm firmly
planted in stage three,

05:35.436 --> 05:36.835
bargaining.

05:36.837 --> 05:38.937
Dear God, if you stop
Cece's breast reduction,
- Okay.

05:38.939 --> 05:41.606
I'll circumcise Coach.
WINSTON: Whoa, Coach.

05:41.608 --> 05:43.375
Go out with them tonight?
Doesn't make any sense, man.

05:43.377 --> 05:45.444
And compromise
the long game? Ha.

05:45.446 --> 05:47.446
Not until I replace their
rocker switches with dimmers.

05:47.448 --> 05:49.548
Forget your long game,
Winston! Getting a girl

05:49.550 --> 05:51.550
to have sex with you is
not about planning ahead.

05:51.552 --> 05:53.151
It is about seizing
opportunities

05:53.153 --> 05:55.520
that you never saw coming.
It is instinct.

05:55.522 --> 05:56.655
All right?
It is improv.

05:56.657 --> 05:58.056
It is jazz, man.

05:58.058 --> 06:00.492
But with words. You dig?
And the words are,

06:00.494 --> 06:02.194
"Oh, yeah, girl,
I'm about to..."

06:02.196 --> 06:04.196
(scatting loudly)

06:04.198 --> 06:05.731
(phone vibrating)

06:05.733 --> 06:07.466
(humming quietly)

06:07.468 --> 06:09.468
(chuckles) Glen, my man,
tell me something good.

06:09.470 --> 06:11.069
And you better not be
trying to sell me

06:11.071 --> 06:13.171
some non-dimmable halogens,
you son of a...

06:13.173 --> 06:15.607
Where you at?
Are you kidding me?

06:16.542 --> 06:18.076
(sighs)

06:18.078 --> 06:19.845
Hey, buddy.

06:19.847 --> 06:22.714
You know what you need to
surround yourself with tonight?

06:22.716 --> 06:25.550
Four new boobs.

06:27.887 --> 06:29.855
On two different women?

06:29.857 --> 06:31.189
You're damn right.

06:31.191 --> 06:32.858
Take me to them.

06:32.860 --> 06:34.426
(laughs)

06:34.428 --> 06:37.195
Um, do you want to, like,
go find a bar, grab a drink?

06:37.197 --> 06:40.232
There's a bar that I like.

06:40.234 --> 06:43.235
It's called... my place.

06:43.237 --> 06:45.837
Great. Uh, is it...
You think it'll be crowded?

06:45.839 --> 06:47.606
You know I'm talking
about my house, right?

06:47.608 --> 06:49.207
Okay. Yeah, no, I wasn't...
I thought that was just

06:49.209 --> 06:50.909
a clever name, but now I do.
- No.

06:50.911 --> 06:53.011
And, yeah, let's go there.

06:53.013 --> 06:54.413
(laughs)

06:55.548 --> 06:57.282
Um, one thing I want to,

06:57.284 --> 06:59.451
uh, disclose to you
in a very mature

06:59.453 --> 07:02.454
adult way, I...
live with my ex.

07:02.456 --> 07:05.424
Okay. Uh, yeah,
you live with your ex.
- Yeah.

07:05.426 --> 07:06.925
But also three other guys.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.593
It's more zany than sexy.

07:08.595 --> 07:10.929
Okay. So it, like,
wasn't really serious?

07:10.931 --> 07:12.531
Oh, it was very serious.

07:12.533 --> 07:14.199
Did you say "I love you"?

07:14.201 --> 07:16.401
Not until he said it.
(chuckles)

07:16.403 --> 07:18.370
Uh, yeah, I don't think
I can do this.

07:18.372 --> 07:20.305
I'm sorry. I just...
- What?

07:20.307 --> 07:22.574
I've been on so many weird dates
lately. I'm just looking
No. Ian.

07:22.576 --> 07:23.975
for something easier. I...
No, Ian, Ian, Ian,

07:23.977 --> 07:26.044
Ian, Ian, look.

07:26.046 --> 07:29.648
Yes, I live with my ex.

07:29.650 --> 07:32.284
But there's nothing
to worry about.

07:33.419 --> 07:34.786
Because...

07:34.788 --> 07:37.289
Nick. You're gay.

07:37.291 --> 07:38.123
Huh?
- You're gay.

07:38.125 --> 07:40.158
Be gay. Be gay. Be gay.

07:40.160 --> 07:41.126
Be gay?

07:41.128 --> 07:42.661
Hey.
(chuckles)

07:42.663 --> 07:44.563
I just had to make sure
these animals flushed.

07:44.565 --> 07:46.331
Oh.
- Not you, you
fastidious queen.

07:47.433 --> 07:48.767
Oh, y-you must be Nick.

07:48.769 --> 07:51.736
Well, friends call me Gay Nick.

07:55.741 --> 07:57.642
My perfect Sunday-- sitting
here, watching the game,

07:57.644 --> 07:59.478
eating a pot pie
with a hot dude

07:59.480 --> 08:01.613
with no shirt on,
on my lap kissing me.

08:01.615 --> 08:03.815
Right on, man.
- Right on, man.

08:03.817 --> 08:05.016
All right.
- You got it.

08:05.018 --> 08:06.418
(imitates explosion)

08:06.420 --> 08:07.819
Uh, can I use
your restroom?

08:07.821 --> 08:09.120
Yeah. It's down the hall
to the right.

08:09.122 --> 08:10.689
Don't worry. I won't peek.

08:10.691 --> 08:12.624
But he wants to.
- (chuckles)

08:12.626 --> 08:14.025
Oh, my God, I am so sorry.

08:14.027 --> 08:15.360
I should just
tell him the truth.

08:15.362 --> 08:16.795
It's too late
for the truth, Jess.

08:16.797 --> 08:18.129
You live with a gay man,

08:18.131 --> 08:19.664
and this gay man's
gonna help you get laid.

08:19.666 --> 08:22.367
Okay. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

08:22.369 --> 08:24.002
Do you think you
can play a gay man?

08:24.004 --> 08:25.804
I'm terrible at lying,
I'm terrific at make-believe.

08:25.806 --> 08:28.006
Okay.
- Okay? But I need
to know some backstory

08:28.008 --> 08:29.508
'cause it's very
important to me.

08:29.510 --> 08:31.309
Okay. Yeah,
backstory's important.
- Okay.

08:31.311 --> 08:32.878
Tell me, have I always
known I was gay,

08:32.880 --> 08:34.479
or did I just recently
realize it?

08:34.481 --> 08:36.348
That's-- Um, you-you always
knew you were gay,

08:36.350 --> 08:38.617
but you grew up
in an oil town

08:38.619 --> 08:40.552
where masculinity was
the most valued currency.

08:40.554 --> 08:42.821
Um, you-you had an older
brother named Chip.

08:42.823 --> 08:44.789
And Chip was
a union guy.
- Yes.

08:44.791 --> 08:46.625
And if it wasn't
about Teamster Local 11,

08:46.627 --> 08:48.193
Chip didn't want
to hear about it.

08:48.195 --> 08:49.461
Oh, my God, we're doing this.

08:49.463 --> 08:51.029
When I came out, was it flashy?

08:51.031 --> 08:52.497
Was it emotional?

08:52.499 --> 08:54.900
Am I mad that Anderson Cooper
doesn't fly the flag?

08:54.902 --> 08:58.003
Or for what he's doing in his
own way-- is it even braver?

08:58.005 --> 09:00.071
These are all really good
questions, but I just can't

09:00.073 --> 09:02.207
get my mind off, like,
why you dress this way.

09:02.209 --> 09:04.643
Why aren't you
in better shape?
Don't put me in a box!

09:04.645 --> 09:07.412
There's nothing we gay men hate
more than being put in a box.

09:07.414 --> 09:10.181
Good.
- Look, maybe I'm a bear,
maybe I'm a twinkler.

09:10.183 --> 09:12.551
That's not a category.
(loudly): I like rugby

09:12.553 --> 09:15.253
for the game
and for the men.

09:15.255 --> 09:17.022
Now, if you excuse me,
I got to go do

09:17.024 --> 09:18.390
that gay thing
I was telling you about,

09:18.392 --> 09:20.392
because, of course,
I'm gay as hell.

09:20.394 --> 09:21.993
(laughs)
- Bye.

09:21.995 --> 09:23.562
(whispers):
That's not how gay men talk.

09:23.564 --> 09:26.431
(whispers): I am
shattering stereotypes.

09:27.667 --> 09:29.234
What are you
doing here, man?

09:29.236 --> 09:30.702
WINSTON:
I'm always here.

09:30.704 --> 09:32.537
Very definition
of the long game.

09:32.539 --> 09:34.205
COACH: Forget your long game.
It doesn't...

09:34.207 --> 09:35.574
What is he...?

09:35.576 --> 09:38.176
What are you doing, man?

09:38.178 --> 09:40.345
Is this...?

09:40.347 --> 09:42.781
Is this the fut... the future?

09:42.783 --> 09:45.350
I can hold them both
in one hand.

09:45.352 --> 09:46.751
Yeah, man.

09:46.753 --> 09:47.919
(sighs)

09:47.921 --> 09:49.588
No, no, there it is.
Look at that.

09:49.590 --> 09:53.124
Stage four-- depression.

09:53.126 --> 09:55.727
My two best friends
are going away.

09:55.729 --> 09:58.463
Going away far too soon.

09:58.465 --> 10:01.399
And if you were lucky enough
to meet them,

10:01.401 --> 10:04.769
to touch them,
to be touched by them,

10:04.771 --> 10:06.771
you came away
a better person.

10:06.773 --> 10:08.540
If you'll excuse me.

10:08.542 --> 10:10.275
Is he... is he talking
about you guys?

10:10.277 --> 10:13.378
Yes. Yes, he is, uh...
he's talking about us.

10:13.380 --> 10:16.081
We are, unfortunately,
we're going away... tomorrow.

10:16.083 --> 10:19.751
So, uh, we better make
tonight count, huh, ladies?

10:19.753 --> 10:21.219
Wait.

10:21.221 --> 10:22.787
We barely got
to know you!

10:22.789 --> 10:25.156
How long will
you be gone?

10:25.158 --> 10:27.892
For... for...

10:27.894 --> 10:29.828
44 weeks.
- 44 weeks?

10:29.830 --> 10:30.895
Tell them about
our business, man.

10:30.897 --> 10:32.631
You don't have to be
shy about it.

10:32.633 --> 10:34.599
Uh, right.
- No. Yeah.

10:34.601 --> 10:36.601
Hello. Do you like socks?

10:36.603 --> 10:38.470
We sell socks.

10:38.472 --> 10:40.905
Everybody likes socks.

10:40.907 --> 10:43.608
I just cried on my penis
while I was peeing.
- Whoa.

10:43.610 --> 10:45.076
SCHMIDT:
That happened.

10:45.078 --> 10:46.678
I just can't stop thinking
about them.

10:46.680 --> 10:48.413
(sighs)

10:48.415 --> 10:51.182
You know, there are some people
that are gonna say that they...

10:51.184 --> 10:53.084
they look alike.

10:53.086 --> 10:55.787
That they're exactly the same.
And you know what?

10:55.789 --> 10:57.656
They just don't know them
like I know them.

10:57.658 --> 10:59.357
Truth-truth be told?

10:59.359 --> 11:00.859
One of them...

11:00.861 --> 11:03.328
One of them is slightly
more brown than the other.

11:03.330 --> 11:05.130
And they're so unique,

11:05.132 --> 11:07.465
and they're so special.

11:07.467 --> 11:09.167
You know what I'm gonna miss
most about them?

11:09.169 --> 11:12.003
Watching them bounce.

11:12.005 --> 11:13.838
Watching them...

11:13.840 --> 11:15.907
Watching them bounce.

11:24.316 --> 11:26.351
If you just give me
a chance to exp...

11:26.353 --> 11:28.987
Well, easy come,
easy go.

11:28.989 --> 11:31.823
Easy? Easy?!

11:31.825 --> 11:35.026
You just stole six
months of my life, man.

11:35.028 --> 11:38.530
I am... I am
P.O.'d, hombre!

11:38.532 --> 11:40.231
Winston!

11:41.367 --> 11:43.001
Can I get a high five?
- Bam.

11:43.003 --> 11:44.636
(laughs)

11:44.638 --> 11:46.471
Sorry I called you a biscuit.

11:46.473 --> 11:48.173
I'm sorry I liked
it so much.
- (laughs)

11:48.175 --> 11:50.241
(knocking)
- NICK:
Hey, Jess, you in there?

11:50.243 --> 11:51.710
Is that Nick?

11:51.712 --> 11:53.144
Do you mean Gay Nick?

11:53.146 --> 11:54.813
Yeah, that's Gay Nick.

11:57.349 --> 11:59.250
(whispering):
I am so sorry.
- What's going on?

11:59.252 --> 12:01.753
I screwed up.
(door opens)

12:05.357 --> 12:06.758
A girl, Nick?
- I know.

12:06.760 --> 12:08.093
Nick, really?

12:08.095 --> 12:09.928
(laughs):
Hey.

12:09.930 --> 12:12.263
(laughs)

12:14.033 --> 12:16.367
You look like my
dead friend Karen.

12:16.369 --> 12:18.870
Does anyone ever
tell you that?
- Hmm, no.

12:18.872 --> 12:20.839
Thank you.
- NICK:
Hmm.

12:22.007 --> 12:23.875
(door closes)
What?!

12:23.877 --> 12:25.910
I wanted to be gay
for you, I really did,

12:25.912 --> 12:27.746
but it's a very
hard time to be gay.

12:27.748 --> 12:29.914
Girls are wearing
scarves and boots.

12:29.916 --> 12:31.583
They have so many
layers to them.

12:31.585 --> 12:34.018
What is underneath all those
layers? I want to find out!

12:34.020 --> 12:35.854
Are you blaming autumn?

12:35.856 --> 12:38.223
Look, it was one night.
Get rid of her!

12:38.225 --> 12:40.759
I tried. I told her I live with
my ex, and she didn't care.

12:40.761 --> 12:42.727
You look so cute
in the morning.
(laughs)

12:42.729 --> 12:44.562
You talking
to me or her?
(laughter)

12:44.564 --> 12:47.132
(door closes)
- Okay. I'll get rid of her.

12:47.134 --> 12:49.067
I'll just pretend
to be your crazy ex-girlfriend.

12:49.069 --> 12:52.070
I can do this. I did a one-woman
production of<i> A Christmas Carol.</i>

12:52.072 --> 12:54.939
(British accent):
You, sir, what day is it?

12:54.941 --> 12:57.142
Aye, it's Christmas day.

12:57.144 --> 12:59.811
That was not good.

12:59.813 --> 13:02.313
It was perfect.
- Thank you.
I thought you'd think that.

13:02.315 --> 13:03.815
Yeah, it's perfect.
All right, look,

13:03.817 --> 13:05.316
you stay here
and keep your gay warm, okay?

13:05.318 --> 13:07.752
In case Ian comes back.
Also, can we agree

13:07.754 --> 13:09.888
that this is not the most
mature way to handle things?

13:09.890 --> 13:10.989
Even though it's pretty fun.

13:10.991 --> 13:12.557
It's no fun a
couple Bellinis

13:12.559 --> 13:14.793
and a round of apples
to apples can't solve.

13:14.795 --> 13:16.795
What kind of gay are you?
I'm still finding it.

13:16.797 --> 13:18.329
All right.
- All right.

13:21.734 --> 13:23.601
Nick thinks we're broken
up, but he also thinks

13:23.603 --> 13:26.104
that the last girl he slept
with wasn't me in a wig.

13:26.106 --> 13:27.472
(laughs)

13:27.474 --> 13:29.707
Wigs are so good
for tricking guys.

13:30.643 --> 13:33.011
I'm around all the time.

13:33.013 --> 13:35.313
Do you really want to get
yourself in this situation?

13:35.315 --> 13:38.583
My last boyfriend was, like,
honestly in his 80s.

13:38.585 --> 13:41.653
I was just like,
"Don't die, Myron."

13:41.655 --> 13:44.088
Does that answer
your question?

13:44.090 --> 13:45.690
Tell me everything
you did sexually!

13:45.692 --> 13:47.659
Everything!
All of it, or leave!

13:47.661 --> 13:48.993
I put my finger...
- Stop!

13:48.995 --> 13:50.328
But you asked...
- No.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.463
I-I did, but
it backfired.

13:52.465 --> 13:53.965
WINSTON:
Ah, so it<i> is</i>

13:53.967 --> 13:55.867
load bearing, huh?

13:55.869 --> 13:57.335
What are you doing?

13:57.337 --> 14:00.138
Me? Oh, well, first,
I'm putting up the shelves.

14:00.140 --> 14:01.940
Then I got to finish the floor,

14:01.942 --> 14:04.642
so that the shelves can
appear level, then the ceiling.

14:04.644 --> 14:07.345
Enough! All right? You've
done enough for these women.

14:07.347 --> 14:09.380
Look, ladies, I tried
to manipulate you,

14:09.382 --> 14:11.149
and I am sorry about that, but

14:11.151 --> 14:13.651
you guys have been manipulating
my friend for months.

14:13.653 --> 14:16.855
It is not okay. Just dangling
sex like a little carrot.

14:16.857 --> 14:19.390
We are not using sex
to get Winston to do stuff.

14:19.392 --> 14:20.391
No.

14:20.393 --> 14:23.494
Wait. You're not?
- No.

14:23.496 --> 14:24.629
Well, then he's
done doing stuff.

14:24.631 --> 14:26.698
Come on, Winston.
You're better than this.

14:26.700 --> 14:28.533
Forget you guys.

14:28.535 --> 14:29.567
Wait!

14:29.569 --> 14:31.903
Yeah, just-just
give us a minute.

14:31.905 --> 14:33.705
Okay, we have
to talk about...
- Okay.

14:33.707 --> 14:35.874
What are they
whispering about?
- I don't know.

14:35.876 --> 14:37.342
We could just
stack the books.

14:37.344 --> 14:38.743
No...
- No.

14:38.745 --> 14:40.945
Oh, man, this is
embarrassing.

14:43.148 --> 14:44.382
Uh...

14:44.384 --> 14:46.818
Okay. It's me.

14:46.820 --> 14:48.253
Come on.

14:48.255 --> 14:49.320
What?

14:49.322 --> 14:51.422
Wait. Listen. Um...

14:51.424 --> 14:52.523
Michelle, you don't
have to do this.

14:52.525 --> 14:53.758
That's okay. I
kind of want to.

14:53.760 --> 14:56.027
Just, uh, keep the
pencil behind your ear,

14:56.029 --> 14:59.931
and bring the hard hat,
um, and the safety goggles.

15:02.234 --> 15:06.004
(whispers):
Long game.

15:10.276 --> 15:12.277
(sighs)

15:12.279 --> 15:14.512
Wonder what's taking,
uh, Jess so long.

15:14.514 --> 15:15.947
Well, you know women.

15:15.949 --> 15:17.348
What's women?

15:17.350 --> 15:18.650
(laughs)

15:20.552 --> 15:23.421
(laughs):
Am I right?
- "What's women?"

15:23.423 --> 15:26.090
I just don't know them
like you know them, is my point.

15:26.092 --> 15:27.258
Uh-huh.

15:27.260 --> 15:31.129
Uh, so, what kind of guys
do you like to date?

15:31.131 --> 15:32.430
Me? All kinds.

15:32.432 --> 15:33.898
Yeah.

15:33.900 --> 15:37.936
Hunks. If I can get my, uh,
paws on a hunk, I don't let go.

15:37.938 --> 15:40.371
Uh, ripped nerds.

15:40.373 --> 15:42.707
'Cause they're smart
but strong, I guess.

15:42.709 --> 15:44.575
Uh-huh.
- I like Spanish guys.

15:44.577 --> 15:46.978
Throw in a little, uh,
hint of German in there,

15:46.980 --> 15:48.646
there's a perfect combo.

15:48.648 --> 15:49.981
Okay.

15:49.983 --> 15:52.116
Certain ice cream men, I guess.

15:52.118 --> 15:54.585
Carpet steamers. Sleepy guys.

15:54.587 --> 15:57.455
Uh, we in the gay community
call them "drowsers."

15:57.457 --> 15:58.957
Why would you like
a sleepy guy?

15:58.959 --> 16:01.092
Look... I'm so
out of the game--

16:01.094 --> 16:02.327
I'm in a relationship.

16:02.329 --> 16:03.628
Um...

16:03.630 --> 16:05.229
he's got a nice penis.

16:05.231 --> 16:07.231
You're sweating a lot.

16:07.233 --> 16:08.933
That's what he said! Am I right?

16:08.935 --> 16:10.335
(laughs)

16:10.337 --> 16:13.638
I'm a sweaty lover,
is what he says to me.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.506
Okay, you know, you
really don't seem gay.

16:15.508 --> 16:17.809
I don't buy it.

16:19.078 --> 16:21.846
Hey.
- Not now.

16:21.848 --> 16:23.648
Probably wondering why I
didn't come home last night.

16:23.650 --> 16:26.684
Just needed some space to
process this whole thing.

16:26.686 --> 16:28.486
I'm sorry if our
room felt empty.

16:28.488 --> 16:31.422
(sighs)

16:31.424 --> 16:33.124
Well, it did.

16:33.126 --> 16:34.826
I was really worried
about you.

16:34.828 --> 16:36.995
So where were you?
You owe me that much.

16:36.997 --> 16:39.630
I just went walking on
the streets last night.

16:39.632 --> 16:42.000
I needed to come to
terms with all this.

16:42.002 --> 16:44.869
Ended up in a park.
I know that's stupid,

16:44.871 --> 16:46.270
but I promise
I was careful.

16:46.272 --> 16:47.638
I mean, I was
totally safe.

16:47.640 --> 16:48.840
A park?

16:48.842 --> 16:50.808
I don't know, man.
- Hey,

16:50.810 --> 16:53.311
I'm upset... but I understand.

16:53.313 --> 16:54.979
It's okay.

16:54.981 --> 16:56.214
Come here.

16:57.649 --> 16:59.517
Come here.

16:59.519 --> 17:01.352
(sighs)
There, there.

17:05.357 --> 17:06.824
Thanks.

17:06.826 --> 17:07.525
Yeah.

17:07.527 --> 17:09.527
Acceptance. Wow.

17:09.529 --> 17:10.361
Yeah.

17:12.464 --> 17:14.532
Give me a kiss.

17:16.168 --> 17:17.902
Just give me a kiss.

17:17.904 --> 17:19.370
All right?

17:22.708 --> 17:25.043
I felt like you needed that
more than I did.

17:25.045 --> 17:27.311
(sighs)

17:27.313 --> 17:29.013
Your scruff, by the way,
is perfect.

17:29.015 --> 17:31.315
Don't touch your
beard trimming setting.
- Okay.

17:32.317 --> 17:33.818
Take it easy.
Okay.

17:35.354 --> 17:36.854
That was beautiful.

17:36.856 --> 17:38.089
I'm-I'm sorry,
you know?

17:38.091 --> 17:39.991
I think I'm just
more used to, like,

17:39.993 --> 17:41.592
stereotypical gay guys,
like him, you know?

17:41.594 --> 17:43.494
You offended me.
- I'm sorry.

17:43.496 --> 17:45.096
Ian! Ian!

17:45.098 --> 17:46.731
Ian, hi. There are some events
that are about to occur

17:46.733 --> 17:48.032
that I'd like
to get ahead of.

17:48.034 --> 17:49.867
Um, the truth is that Nick is...

17:49.869 --> 17:51.836
Oh, God.

17:53.672 --> 17:55.239
Get off of me!

17:55.241 --> 17:57.008
You're not a man!

18:01.346 --> 18:04.382
Ian! Wait.
I'm so sorry I lied,

18:04.384 --> 18:06.717
and you don't owe me
anything, but could I just

18:06.719 --> 18:08.453
ask you one thing
before you leave?

18:08.455 --> 18:10.088
What is this,
an exit interview?
Is there any good way

18:10.090 --> 18:12.857
I could have told you
about my living situation?

18:12.859 --> 18:15.526
Okay, you know what?
Fair question. Um... no!

18:15.528 --> 18:17.462
Look, Nick was
just trying to help me.
Clearly,

18:17.464 --> 18:19.764
he would do anything for you.
I mean, he went so far

18:19.766 --> 18:22.066
as to hire an actual gay man
to play his cheating lover.

18:22.068 --> 18:25.269
What? Oh, my God.
You know what?

18:25.271 --> 18:26.604
I think that was Schmidt.

18:26.606 --> 18:28.272
He's... not gay.

18:28.274 --> 18:30.374
When are the lies
gonna stop?!

18:30.376 --> 18:31.776
Now, this is just
a consultation,

18:31.778 --> 18:33.144
so do your best
to relax.

18:33.146 --> 18:34.145
Okay.

18:34.147 --> 18:35.113
Stop the surgery!

18:35.115 --> 18:38.049
This is just a consultation.

18:38.051 --> 18:39.217
May we have the room, please?

18:39.219 --> 18:41.252
That's what it's here for.

18:41.254 --> 18:42.186
I'm sorry.

18:45.624 --> 18:47.425
What are you doing?!
Okay, look, I know

18:47.427 --> 18:50.094
I can't stop this,
and I accept that,

18:50.096 --> 18:51.963
but I just wanted
to stop it long enough

18:51.965 --> 18:53.431
so that I could
say good-bye.

18:53.433 --> 18:57.135
Aw. Look, this is a
low-risk procedure, okay?

18:57.137 --> 18:58.803
I'm gonna be fine.

18:58.805 --> 19:00.972
Oh, you meant say
good-bye to my boobs.

19:00.974 --> 19:02.507
I forgot who I
was talking to.

19:02.509 --> 19:05.109
No, Schmidt, you
cannot see my boobs.

19:05.111 --> 19:07.178
I need to look them in the eyes.
I can't let them leave

19:07.180 --> 19:08.980
without knowing how much
they've meant to me.

19:08.982 --> 19:10.281
I'll let them know.
- No.

19:10.283 --> 19:12.250
I need to tell them myself.

19:12.252 --> 19:14.619
(groans) All right...

19:14.621 --> 19:17.321
you can say good-bye
to one, all right?

19:17.323 --> 19:19.023
I mean, j-just one?
One.

19:19.025 --> 19:21.759
(sighs)
Gosh almighty.

19:21.761 --> 19:24.162
The Ultimate Sophie's Cho-Cho.

19:24.164 --> 19:26.097
I mean, there's Harold,
who's just...

19:26.099 --> 19:28.132
full of life...

19:28.134 --> 19:29.500
(groans)

19:29.502 --> 19:32.470
(sighs)
And Kumar, who's shy.

19:32.472 --> 19:35.540
Who's shy, but yet
surprisingly so brave.

19:35.542 --> 19:38.643
But, you know, who wouldn't be
with a best friend like Harold?

19:38.645 --> 19:40.144
Oh, my God, fine!

19:40.146 --> 19:41.979
You can say good-bye
to both, okay?

19:41.981 --> 19:44.382
Okay. I need you
to put these on.
- What?

19:44.384 --> 19:48.019
This is a private conversation
that doesn't concern you.

19:48.021 --> 19:49.453
The playlist...

19:49.455 --> 19:51.289
matches the mood.

19:51.291 --> 19:53.758
(Pachelbel's "Canon in D"
playing)

20:03.635 --> 20:05.736
¶ ¶

20:09.141 --> 20:11.275
¶ ¶

20:17.216 --> 20:19.650
¶ ¶

20:25.057 --> 20:26.257
(music fades)

20:26.259 --> 20:28.192
I mean, I guess
if I'm being honest,

20:28.194 --> 20:30.995
it doesn't matter
what size you are.

20:30.997 --> 20:32.863
I'm always gonna love you,

20:32.865 --> 20:35.199
because you're attached
to the most beautiful person

20:35.201 --> 20:36.834
in the whole world.

20:36.836 --> 20:38.469
(music resumes)

20:42.774 --> 20:44.775
You know what I think? I think

20:44.777 --> 20:47.111
that when people go
on dates with us,

20:47.113 --> 20:48.379
probably talk
to their friends

20:48.381 --> 20:49.747
and their friends say,

20:49.749 --> 20:52.083
"You go on dates with
a lot of weirdos."

20:52.085 --> 20:53.551
(shower running)
Oh, my God.

20:53.553 --> 20:56.454
We're the weirdo ass clowns.

20:56.456 --> 20:59.757
Aw, no. Everyone in their 30s
waits in line for the shower.

20:59.759 --> 21:03.728
I'm sorry, but the truth is,
as long as you live with me,

21:03.730 --> 21:05.630
you're not gonna meet
a normal guy.

21:05.632 --> 21:06.764
(Jess chuckles)

21:06.766 --> 21:08.766
Why are you guys
all in here?

21:08.768 --> 21:10.534
Winston's taking
a long-ass shower.

21:10.536 --> 21:11.702
Poor guy gets dirty.

21:11.704 --> 21:12.903
All right, let me see the new.

21:12.905 --> 21:14.105
I accept it.

21:14.107 --> 21:15.806
Again, it was just
a consultation.

21:15.808 --> 21:18.309
And actually, I don't even know
if I'm gonna go through with it.

21:18.311 --> 21:20.311
You're still here.
I saved you.

21:20.313 --> 21:22.046
I'm your Schindler.
One day, your children

21:22.048 --> 21:23.914
are gonna put rocks
on my grave.

21:23.916 --> 21:26.617
Hey, uh, wow.
You guys mind if I get cuts?

21:26.619 --> 21:29.053
'Cause I am<i> very</i> dirty.
JESS: Wait a minute.

21:29.055 --> 21:30.087
Who's in the sh...

21:30.089 --> 21:31.756
Hey, what's the vibe here

21:31.758 --> 21:32.957
on shower pee-pee?

21:32.959 --> 21:34.792
I'm just trying to plan my day.

21:34.794 --> 21:36.594
Who is this woman?!

21:36.596 --> 21:38.763
You have awesome water pressure.

21:38.765 --> 21:42.600
You should see
what's falling out of my hair.

21:42.602 --> 21:44.101
Well, Nick...

21:44.103 --> 21:46.270
looks like you're gonna
have to marry her.

21:46.272 --> 21:47.838
It's looking
that way, isn't it?
- Yeah.

21:47.840 --> 21:49.774
She's not so bad.
She's peeing in the shower.

21:49.776 --> 21:52.143
Yeah, she is. Classic Tina.
(laughs) That's weird.
