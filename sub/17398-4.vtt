WEBVTT

00:11.720 --> 00:15.159
'Tonight, I use a machine.'
Agh!

00:15.160 --> 00:18.199
James writes on a blackboard...

00:18.200 --> 00:21.400
And Richard lobs fruit
into a caravan.

00:26.560 --> 00:29.799
APPLAUSE
Thank you, everybody.

00:29.800 --> 00:32.319
Thank you, thank you so much.

00:32.320 --> 00:36.160
Good evening, hello. Thank you,
everybody. Thank you so much.

00:37.680 --> 00:43.439
Now, in the not very olden days,
Jaguar had a worldwide
reputation for...

00:43.440 --> 00:48.559
I was going to say quality - not
quality, but quietness, comfort,

00:48.560 --> 00:51.159
restrained good looks and value.

00:51.160 --> 00:57.039
Now, though,
they've introduced a new car which
seems to be only about one thing.

00:57.040 --> 00:59.439
Speed.

00:59.440 --> 01:02.199
120. 130.

01:02.200 --> 01:04.280
140.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.839
Into fifth.

01:07.840 --> 01:09.559
150.

01:09.560 --> 01:11.799
160.

01:11.800 --> 01:13.880
170. In a Jag! Come on!

01:18.200 --> 01:22.079
Apparently with a long
enough runway, it'll hit 186.

01:22.080 --> 01:25.280
Woah!
This isn't long enough. Help, help!

01:27.000 --> 01:33.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:34.040 --> 01:37.639
So, welcome to the new XKR-S,

01:37.640 --> 01:43.599
the most powerful road car
Jaguar has ever made.

01:43.600 --> 01:48.919
The supercharged V8 has been
re-calibrated and the exhausts
beefed-up

01:48.920 --> 01:55.279
so that it now fires
542 horsepower at the rear wheels.

01:55.280 --> 01:58.440
That's on the edge
of Ferrari territory.

02:00.440 --> 02:03.559
As a result, it feels and sounds

02:03.560 --> 02:09.759
as though it's being fuelled by a
blend of plutonium and wild animals.

02:12.160 --> 02:14.720
It's very fast.

02:17.200 --> 02:19.880
And very, very loud.

02:24.520 --> 02:26.479
And then in the corners,

02:26.480 --> 02:30.720
it'll get its tail out more readily
than George Michael.

02:32.400 --> 02:35.840
There you go. Hit the throttle...

02:37.640 --> 02:40.439
A lot of smoke. Ha-ha!

02:40.440 --> 02:43.079
It's mad! A mad car.

02:43.080 --> 02:47.840
It's like Terry Thomas
with a sub-machine gun.

02:53.000 --> 02:57.479
To make sure deaf people don't
mistake the S for an ordinary XKR,

02:57.480 --> 03:01.959
the body has bigger sills,
a bigger rear spoiler,

03:01.960 --> 03:04.960
and snowshoes on the bonnet.

03:06.480 --> 03:09.479
It's also got this new
downturned nose which makes

03:09.480 --> 03:14.759
it look rather disapproving,
like a 1950s seaside landlady.

03:14.760 --> 03:19.519
And I'm sorry but
red brake callipers on a Jag...

03:19.520 --> 03:24.199
it's like fitting Camilla Parker
Bowles with a vajazzle and rings.

03:24.200 --> 03:26.680
I'm saying this out loud, aren't I?

03:28.680 --> 03:34.279
Inside, we find leather designed
to look like carbon fibre,

03:34.280 --> 03:36.519
and blue ambient lighting.

03:36.520 --> 03:40.439
The walnut from Jags
of yesteryear, gone.

03:40.440 --> 03:44.439
The gentleman's club has been
turned into Grant Bovey's gym.

03:44.440 --> 03:47.359
There are other issues, too.

03:47.360 --> 03:49.679
The ride is a bit harsh.

03:49.680 --> 03:53.959
Run over a pheasant, and
you'd be able to tell if
it was a cock or a hen.

03:53.960 --> 03:57.479
Then there's the price,
it's not what you call cheap.

03:57.480 --> 04:01.559
In fact it's what
you'd call £97,000,

04:01.560 --> 04:05.600
and that's what you'd call
nearly 100 grand.

04:08.880 --> 04:13.479
So, Jag has sacrificed subtlety,
good looks, comfort, silence

04:13.480 --> 04:18.600
and value - all its core values -
in the pursuit of speed.

04:27.840 --> 04:31.839
But if all you're interested
in is speed, I wonder,

04:31.840 --> 04:35.440
would you be
better off with the Nissan GTR?

04:37.280 --> 04:38.879
This is the new model.

04:38.880 --> 04:45.120
More powerful, more aerodynamic
and unbelievably even more grippy.

04:48.040 --> 04:52.599
We're told it's a masterclass in
what's technically possible
right now.

04:52.600 --> 04:57.639
Built in a hermetically sealed
factory, it's the last word

04:57.640 --> 04:59.640
in precision engineering.

05:01.160 --> 05:05.679
Every single piece -
the brakes, all four wheels,

05:05.680 --> 05:09.199
the 3.8 litre twin-turbo engine,

05:09.200 --> 05:11.839
the steering, the new
double clutch gearbox,

05:11.840 --> 05:16.679
they're all electronically linked
to sing the song of speed

05:16.680 --> 05:18.640
in perfect harmony.

05:20.160 --> 05:22.919
Let me give you just one example.

05:22.920 --> 05:26.159
The tyres on this car are filled
with nitrogen

05:26.160 --> 05:29.399
because ordinary air
is considered to be too unstable.

05:29.400 --> 05:32.599
It expands and it contracts
too much.

05:32.600 --> 05:36.079
And I know what they mean,
air drives me mad.

05:36.080 --> 05:41.080
It's too big, it's too little.
Rrrrr! Air!

05:44.880 --> 05:50.840
But can this OCD special really
be faster than the bonkers Jag?

05:53.920 --> 05:57.679
The Jag has 20 more horsepowers and
50 more torques,

05:57.680 --> 06:01.599
and I know this is lighter
and it has launch control,

06:01.600 --> 06:07.239
which is what I'm engaging now,
but on paper this can't win.

06:07.240 --> 06:13.120
Three, two, one! Oh, my God!

06:18.640 --> 06:22.320
That was 0-60 in three seconds.

06:25.080 --> 06:28.640
The Jag is just a speck.

06:30.240 --> 06:35.399
It's funny, the Jag is surprisingly
fast because it's a Jag.

06:35.400 --> 06:37.480
This is surprisingly fast
because it's surprisingly fast.

06:45.160 --> 06:48.719
That was not a win,
that was a demolition.

06:48.720 --> 06:54.040
I don't think I've ever been
in a car that has launched itself
quite like that.

06:56.080 --> 06:59.519
And don't think the Jag can get
away on the corners either.

06:59.520 --> 07:04.080
Here it is now coming through the
follow-through as fast as it can.

07:08.240 --> 07:12.079
That's 84.8mph.

07:12.080 --> 07:14.919
And here is the Nissan...

07:14.920 --> 07:18.199
same corner, same conditions,
same driver.

07:18.200 --> 07:23.959
That's 93.3mph.

07:23.960 --> 07:29.319
So it's 8.5mph faster and that
explains why at the Nurburgring,

07:29.320 --> 07:34.599
where there are 147 corners, the
Jag takes nine minutes to do a lap

07:34.600 --> 07:39.639
while the Nissan can get round
in seven minutes and 24 seconds.

07:39.640 --> 07:44.119
That's faster than almost
anything else with a tax disc.

07:44.120 --> 07:49.920
This is an incredible car. The
new gearbox is spectacularly good.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.239
The engine... Well, it's not
an engine, it's just a bomb.

07:53.240 --> 07:56.079
The turbo is crisp and fantastic,

07:56.080 --> 08:03.239
and if you have the chassis and the
gearbox and the traction control set
in race mode, which they are now,

08:03.240 --> 08:05.399
the grip...

08:05.400 --> 08:07.959
is just mind-boggling.

08:07.960 --> 08:13.040
As I shall now demonstrate
graphically with my face.

08:19.520 --> 08:21.120
Bloody hell!

08:24.440 --> 08:27.959
All I've got
is the PlayStation G reading

08:27.960 --> 08:33.640
telling me how much damage this car
is doing to my internal organs.

08:42.880 --> 08:45.240
Just driving a Nissan.

08:50.560 --> 08:56.479
And yet, despite
everything, this car produces
fewer carbon dioxides than the Jag.

08:56.480 --> 09:03.279
It has seats in the back you can
actually use, a bigger boot,

09:03.280 --> 09:08.039
and at £69,000,
it's nearly £30,000 cheaper.

09:08.040 --> 09:09.959
So the conclusion is easy.

09:09.960 --> 09:14.879
Why buy a brogue that has been
converted into a training shoe,

09:14.880 --> 09:18.239
when for much less you can have
something that was designed

09:18.240 --> 09:21.000
to be a training shoe
in the first place?

09:29.840 --> 09:32.320
Astonishing.

09:37.040 --> 09:41.319
Outstanding. What the GTR is, it's
an instrument of speed. An
instrument. I like it.

09:41.320 --> 09:44.999
What about the Jag, not so good?

09:45.000 --> 09:51.039
I don't understand what Jaguar were
thinking of because they must have
looked at Aston Martin and thought,

09:51.040 --> 09:56.479
"right, they make nothing but a
range of hardcore front-engined GT
cars so we'll do exactly the same."

09:56.480 --> 09:59.359
But you know what the problem is,
don't you?

09:59.360 --> 10:05.679
Jaguar now have a permanent
testing facility at the Nurburgring.

10:05.680 --> 10:09.159
Where they should have
a permanent testing facility

10:09.160 --> 10:14.639
is between the two mini roundabouts
in Chipping Norton where I live
because that's the bumpiest stretch

10:14.640 --> 10:18.639
of road in the known universe and
it's been dug up again by that...

10:18.640 --> 10:20.480
what's that construction company
called that you can't pronounce?

10:20.481 --> 10:22.000
Chlamydia, no, not chlamydia.

10:23.560 --> 10:26.239
Clancy... Whatever it's called.
I know the one you mean.

10:26.240 --> 10:30.639
It would just be intolerable in a
car like that. So hang on, let me
get this straight, you're saying

10:30.640 --> 10:35.599
Jaguar should tailor their cars
to the Chipping Norton set. Yes.

10:35.600 --> 10:41.119
What's the point of that? Aren't they
all going to be in prison next week?
LAUGHTER

10:41.120 --> 10:45.119
Thank you, nice to know my friends
can count on you for your support.

10:45.120 --> 10:50.839
Now, though, it's time to find out
how fast the Nissan goes round our
track and that means handing it

10:50.840 --> 10:52.599
over to our tame racing driver.

10:52.600 --> 10:54.919
Some say

10:54.920 --> 10:58.440
that he once hacked
into his own helmet,

10:59.960 --> 11:06.039
and that he thinks Harper Seven
is a convicted terrorist cell.

11:06.040 --> 11:09.000
All we know is he's called the Stig.

11:10.520 --> 11:13.839
And he's off. A tiny chirp from
the back tyres, then a crisp smooth

11:13.840 --> 11:18.919
slingshot up to the first corner
like a precise Japanese missile.

11:18.920 --> 11:21.159
Turns in.

11:21.160 --> 11:25.840
Predictably tidy all the way through
and still tidy on the way out.

11:30.760 --> 11:34.879
Stig enjoying Rock the Casbah
in Algerian there.

11:34.880 --> 11:37.079
Wow!
Right, another laser-guided line

11:37.080 --> 11:43.119
through Chicago, hammerhead, the
one place where the Nissan's four
wheel drive might bring understeer.

11:43.120 --> 11:45.919
Not a chance.

11:45.920 --> 11:49.599
Tiny drift towards
the exit, then through.

11:49.600 --> 11:51.120
Cleaner than James's tool bench.

11:54.600 --> 11:58.119
Just kisses 7,000rpm and up a gear.

11:58.120 --> 12:00.919
Fires it into the follow through.

12:00.920 --> 12:04.559
Ballistic, through the tyres.
Two corners left.

12:04.560 --> 12:08.559
Here we go, getting a bit
squirrelly and wiggly in there.

12:08.560 --> 12:14.000
Back under control now
for Gambon, and drifts it
through, and across the line.

12:15.720 --> 12:18.240
OK, now, earlier on...

12:20.320 --> 12:22.199
Thank you, earlier on in the day,

12:22.200 --> 12:26.519
we went around in the jag
and we recorded a time of 1.23.3,

12:26.520 --> 12:29.799
so that goes there, and that's not
bad, it's faster than the DBS

12:29.800 --> 12:31.559
and faster than any other Aston.

12:31.560 --> 12:37.519
However, in the GTR,
he did it in not 1.23.3, OK?

12:37.520 --> 12:39.119
Little bit higher than that.

12:39.120 --> 12:41.359
Little bit harder than an R8V10.

12:41.360 --> 12:42.919
Or a 599.

12:42.920 --> 12:45.399
Or a 599GTO.

12:45.400 --> 12:47.159
Past the old GTR.

12:47.160 --> 12:49.639
Still higher, past the Enzo.

12:49.640 --> 12:53.999
Higher, higher, higher!

12:54.000 --> 12:55.879
There!

12:55.880 --> 13:00.800
Unbelievable! 1.17.8.

13:04.720 --> 13:07.759
So, that's
as fast as he's gone there,

13:07.760 --> 13:09.479
which cost four times as much.

13:09.480 --> 13:14.759
Yes. And it's faster than a
GTO Ferrari, by a big margin,

13:14.760 --> 13:17.919
which is four times as much.
Anyway, we must now do the news.

13:17.920 --> 13:22.079
Before we get into the news properly,
can I just say that, sticking with
the Nissan,

13:22.080 --> 13:25.999
it's very difficult to
get a four-wheel-drive turbocharged
car like that off the line quickly,

13:26.000 --> 13:28.919
except that the Nissan has
a thing called launch control, which

13:28.920 --> 13:34.919
is basically just a computer that
sorts everything out for you, so that
you get a perfect start every time.

13:34.920 --> 13:37.839
Yes, there's just one problem
with the launch control.

13:37.840 --> 13:42.479
It is the stupidest thing
ever fitted to a car. Why?

13:42.480 --> 13:47.599
No, seriously, when you think about
it, what you have to do to engage
it, right, a series of switches.

13:47.600 --> 13:52.999
You put your left foot on the brake,
plant your right foot hard
down on the accelerator, and

13:53.000 --> 13:55.320
when the lights go green you take
your foot of the brake and it goes.

13:55.321 --> 13:57.879
The computer sorts
it out, as you say.

13:57.880 --> 14:01.719
So, OK,
you're at the lights, MEHHHH!

14:01.720 --> 14:05.119
And everyone's looking at you
thinking, what an unintelligent man.

14:05.120 --> 14:11.399
It makes a bit of a scene. It does,
really. The most uncivilised thing
you can do with a car

14:11.400 --> 14:13.920
is use launch control
at a zebra crossing.

14:16.440 --> 14:19.639
Hnnnggghh! Come on, old lady!
It would hurry 'em up!

14:19.640 --> 14:22.799
Can we just say one other thing
as well, about launch control?

14:22.800 --> 14:27.639
Only one of us
has it fitted to our car.

14:27.640 --> 14:30.000
Is it, it's him!

14:31.920 --> 14:33.559
James May has launch control.

14:33.560 --> 14:36.719
Yeah, I don't use it. You don't say!

14:36.720 --> 14:41.119
Are you sure? Every time you're
in the pie shop, "Thanks for
the pies, I'm off! Hnnnggh!

14:41.120 --> 14:43.239
Can anybody think of a device

14:43.240 --> 14:47.079
fitted to modern cars that's
more stupid than launch control?

14:47.080 --> 14:49.279
You're fitted to quite a lot now.

14:49.280 --> 14:51.439
Has anybody got any ideas?

14:51.440 --> 14:54.599
What, like a gizmo? What?
Cup holders!

14:54.600 --> 14:58.799
They're useful, you stupid idiot!

14:58.800 --> 15:03.559
Cup holders are brilliant things,
for if you need a drink -
it won't fall, no, but,

15:03.560 --> 15:06.239
actually, I have a really good one.

15:06.240 --> 15:09.479
Mercedes and BMW now fit
a night-vision camera,

15:09.480 --> 15:12.319
so you can drive along at night,
and the dashboard's got this screen,

15:12.320 --> 15:16.679
showing you what's on the road ahead
so I was driving up a country lane
the other day, single track, OK?

15:16.680 --> 15:18.679
Doing about 60 miles
an hour, which is legal,

15:18.680 --> 15:23.119
middle of the night, and I thought,
God, I'm going to try and drive,
just using the night-vision camera.

15:23.120 --> 15:25.279
Why am I not surprised?

15:25.280 --> 15:28.199
Turned the lights off, looked down
to see where I was going, and there

15:28.200 --> 15:31.320
was a message saying "night vision
not available when lights off"!

15:33.600 --> 15:37.679
Aaargh! That's night vision
that only works...

15:37.680 --> 15:40.559
With the lights on.
Be good for snipers, wouldn't it?

15:40.560 --> 15:44.119
I'll just... bink... put the
lights on, now I can line up.

15:44.120 --> 15:47.279
Now, last week,
James brought you news of a new
Range Rover called the Evoke.

15:47.280 --> 15:52.319
This week, there's more new Range
Rover news, there's a new Sport.

15:52.320 --> 15:57.599
Now, what's interesting about
this is, it has voice control

15:57.600 --> 16:01.560
with what Land-Rover call
a "say what you see" function.

16:03.480 --> 16:09.519
Now, in order to get the car to do
things, it brings up words on the
screen, and then you repeat them.

16:09.520 --> 16:14.039
What's the point of that?
Does it have a picture of
the object next to it?

16:14.040 --> 16:18.519
Apple! Apple!
If it was that, you could have
enormous fun with foreign markets.

16:18.520 --> 16:22.159
In Germany you could bring
up a picture of a squirrel.

16:22.160 --> 16:28.599
Because, if you think about it, all
Germans, no matter how well they
speak English, can't say "squirrel".

16:28.600 --> 16:31.960
"What's this?
That would be a Skvirrol!!"

16:33.680 --> 16:36.559
Any Glaswegians here?

16:36.560 --> 16:38.400
Come here. Where are you?

16:40.200 --> 16:41.959
I want to just test it.

16:41.960 --> 16:43.678
Are you actually from Glasgow? Yes.

16:43.679 --> 16:45.600
Right, can you say "burglar alarm"?
"Burr-glur alar-rm."

16:45.601 --> 16:47.960
No! Burr-glurr alarrrm!

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
Burrr-glurr!

16:55.720 --> 16:58.959
Och, it's the burrr-glurrr
alarrrm gone off again!

16:58.960 --> 17:01.320
Anyway, there you go,
couple of other things about it.

17:01.321 --> 17:03.959
It's got an 825 watt stereo.

17:03.960 --> 17:06.559
That's more than Motorhead.

17:06.560 --> 17:08.839
A lot more. 17 speakers.

17:08.839 --> 17:11.079
And I'm sorry, but that front end
is hideous. I don't know why they

17:11.080 --> 17:13.638
don't just have done with that
car, and call it the Wilmslow.

17:13.640 --> 17:20.239
The day is coming when they fit
that with fake pillars on either
side of the door, I'm warning you.

17:20.240 --> 17:25.999
Now, there is a new version
of the Fiat Punto Abarth out - OK,

17:26.000 --> 17:27.638
it's called the SS.

17:27.640 --> 17:30.239
Here it is. Looks fantastic.
And I have to say, Hammond,

17:30.240 --> 17:34.679
this is the car you should
have taken on our hot hatchback
test to Monte Carlo, recently. Why?

17:34.680 --> 17:37.480
Because it is actually a hot
hatchback.

17:39.800 --> 17:43.839
Anyway, it's a normal Punto Abarth,
which you buy for £17,000,

17:43.840 --> 17:46.559
and then you buy the SS kit,

17:46.560 --> 17:52.039
so different suspension components
and a different ECU for the engine,
taking it up to 180 horsepower, OK?

17:52.040 --> 17:54.040
Now, they arrive in a box.
They make a big deal of this.

17:54.041 --> 17:59.159
They say all the parts arrive
in a high-quality wooden crate.

17:59.160 --> 18:04.119
There it is. Which, apparently,
you can keep as a memento.

18:04.120 --> 18:09.519
I'm sorry, but when I buy a new
washing machine, I don't go, I'm
going to keep the box it came in

18:09.520 --> 18:12.479
as a souvenir of the day
when my washing machine arrived.

18:12.480 --> 18:15.919
I always struggle
throwing boxes away. Why?

18:15.920 --> 18:19.879
If you take the washing machine out
of it, and fit it in your kitchen,

18:19.880 --> 18:23.519
and there's the box, all crisp and
new and empty and I can't help
but look at it,

18:23.520 --> 18:26.239
and part of my mind
sees the potential.

18:26.240 --> 18:30.479
You look at it and you think,
wow, that could be, like, a castle -
you've been there!

18:30.480 --> 18:35.839
Or a den, or a car. With shoeboxes,
I don't think I've ever thrown
one away, because you think,

18:35.840 --> 18:41.399
I could keep special things in it,
or put it on that side and you
could have, like, a TV screen,

18:41.400 --> 18:46.919
or maybe you could use the big box
as a spaceship and then the little
one as a dashboard. Come on!

18:46.920 --> 18:49.519
Richard? Are you all right?

18:49.520 --> 18:51.359
Seriously, because this is a man,

18:51.360 --> 18:55.039
there's no other way of putting
this, with a helicopter licence.

18:55.040 --> 18:56.639
The CAA said I was...

18:56.640 --> 19:00.279
The CAA, if they're watching this,
will think, "He's a madman!"

19:00.280 --> 19:04.280
It's not a real helicopter - it's
just the box his fridge came in.

19:07.120 --> 19:10.279
I just make the noise!

19:10.280 --> 19:13.119
THEY IMITATE
HELICOPTER ROTORS

19:13.120 --> 19:18.119
You don't live in a house, you just
live in boxes that things came in.

19:18.120 --> 19:24.799
Now, last week,
these two morons spent good money on
two second-hand V12 coupes.

19:24.800 --> 19:29.879
They spent the same money you would
spend on the Nissan Pixo, the
cheapest new car on sale in Britain.

19:29.880 --> 19:35.519
And I was prepared to bet all my hair
that, within two weeks, one of them
would have gone "pop".

19:35.520 --> 19:37.919
So, chaps, what's the news?

19:37.920 --> 19:40.359
My BMW, 100% not a problem.

19:40.360 --> 19:42.719
Still working perfectly.

19:42.720 --> 19:46.239
There you go, excellent. Moving on...
No, your Mercedes is here.

19:46.240 --> 19:51.479
My Mercedes, yes,
I bought a Mercedes 600CL.

19:51.480 --> 19:53.840
Yes, you did. It's quite interesting,
this, because I have a photograph

19:53.841 --> 19:58.279
here that I'd like to share with
everyone, of the Top Gear car park.

19:58.280 --> 20:02.959
There, in fact, is Hammond's BMW,
and where's your Mercedes?

20:02.960 --> 20:06.639
Warm and dry. Now, moving on...

20:06.640 --> 20:10.359
Tell the ladies and gentlemen
why it isn't in that space.

20:10.360 --> 20:13.079
Can't remember. Tell them.

20:13.080 --> 20:18.799
Tell them! One of its ignition
coils has gone a bit wonky.

20:18.800 --> 20:21.480
It's interesting that you should say
that because I did some research, and

20:21.481 --> 20:28.959
I found out that the ignition coil
for the Nissan Pixo is £138.

20:28.960 --> 20:30.919
How much is it for the Mercedes?

20:30.920 --> 20:32.719
800 and something.

20:32.720 --> 20:35.799
£878.

20:35.800 --> 20:38.159
Sorry, did that include fitting?

20:38.160 --> 20:39.759
No. No.

20:39.760 --> 20:43.479
Did it include the VAT?

20:43.480 --> 20:44.999
No. No.

20:45.000 --> 20:49.479
So, what, in fact, was the cost of a
new ignition coil for your Mercedes?

20:49.480 --> 20:52.279
HE MUMBLES: £1,200.

20:52.280 --> 20:53.999
£1,200, ladies and gentlemen!

20:54.000 --> 20:58.119
Thank you. I keep my hair.

20:58.120 --> 20:59.879
That's annoying.

20:59.880 --> 21:04.199
Now, recent figures have shown
that 71% of people across the UK

21:04.200 --> 21:11.399
still commute by car, and more
people go to work by walking or by
bicycle than they do, by train.

21:11.400 --> 21:16.199
Yeah, and the reason for that
is very simple. Train tickets
are enormously expensive.

21:16.200 --> 21:19.639
And they're enormously
expensive because trains are
enormously expensive to build.

21:19.640 --> 21:21.799
But why are trains
expensive to build?

21:21.800 --> 21:26.239
Why has
Britain's last train maker recently
laid off half its workforce?

21:26.240 --> 21:31.639
Surely there is a solution to this
problem. I mean, how hard can it be?

21:31.640 --> 21:34.559
This is a Jaguar XJS.

21:34.560 --> 21:39.719
It's 22 years old
and it cost £4,500.

21:39.720 --> 21:47.480
For that, we got the convertible
version with the big engine,
the 300 horsepower 5.3 litre V12.

21:50.960 --> 21:56.199
It really does go like a train,
this car, and that is what
got us thinking,

21:56.200 --> 21:58.480
because... could
it actually be a train?

22:02.480 --> 22:07.159
To find out, I took it to Top Gear's
Secret Railway Development Centre

22:07.160 --> 22:10.439
in Leicestershire, just off the A46
near Thurcaston,

22:10.440 --> 22:13.920
where we cued the music
and set to work.

22:15.720 --> 22:18.240
MUSIC: Theme from The A-Team

22:20.440 --> 22:23.520
Perfect!

22:24.960 --> 22:27.080
Argh!

22:36.840 --> 22:41.200
Finally, our XJ Express was ready.

22:54.000 --> 22:58.399
So, what we've done
is replace the standard wheels

22:58.400 --> 23:01.839
with train wheels, and that's it.

23:01.840 --> 23:07.399
Nothing else. The cost savings are
phenomenal, because a normal
railway locomotive is 4 million.

23:07.400 --> 23:13.119
This was in total £4,750.
That is an enormous saving!

23:13.120 --> 23:15.719
It's not much more than
one thousandth of the cost.

23:15.720 --> 23:19.159
Exactly. If we were running
this from Peterborough to London...

23:19.160 --> 23:21.640
I don't know what a season
ticket is. Do you know?

23:21.641 --> 23:23.799
Many thousands of pounds a year.

23:23.800 --> 23:27.599
This would be 20p or 30p.

23:27.600 --> 23:31.080
It was time for the
Jaguar's inaugural run.

23:35.160 --> 23:38.120
I don't think we need to turn that.
We could have taken this off.

23:39.880 --> 23:43.480
Ready? Yeah.
History's in the making. Drive.

23:46.480 --> 23:48.599
We are pulling out of the station.

23:48.600 --> 23:53.120
Oh! No steering - it's weird!

24:01.680 --> 24:05.200
This feels fantastic!
This is awesome.

24:07.080 --> 24:10.440
Sounds like a train. Listen to that!

24:12.000 --> 24:15.120
Blow the horn.
HORN BLARES

24:17.720 --> 24:23.079
We've solved public transport,
literally solved it. Yep!

24:23.080 --> 24:28.559
The only thing that would really
perfect the experience would
be if there were steam.

24:28.560 --> 24:32.639
But, as it's an old Jaguar,
there's a very real chance.

24:32.640 --> 24:36.239
But the old Jag ran like clockwork.

24:36.240 --> 24:38.840
So, we returned to base...

24:40.800 --> 24:43.319
You're all right. You're all right.

24:43.320 --> 24:46.799
You're all right... to attach our
equally brilliant carriages.

24:46.800 --> 24:48.839
You're all right. You're all right.

24:48.840 --> 24:55.639
A modern-day railway carriage costs
in excess of £1 million.

24:55.640 --> 25:00.000
Ours didn't cost
anything like that much.

25:04.160 --> 25:06.519
Now, we have made some
mechanical modifications.

25:06.520 --> 25:11.559
We've stripped out the
central wheels and added one
in each corner for extra stability.

25:11.560 --> 25:13.759
And we've introduced a class system.

25:13.760 --> 25:20.840
Absolutely. Now, I have taken the
Pageant CD Champagne model, no less,
and used it to create first class.

25:22.640 --> 25:26.079
Inside, it was
beautifully appointed,

25:26.080 --> 25:30.319
creating an atmosphere that I
hoped would resurrect the golden age

25:30.320 --> 25:33.800
of train travel for the
discerning first-class passenger.

25:36.400 --> 25:42.359
Hammond, meanwhile, had been
responsible for the buffet car
and second class.

25:42.360 --> 25:44.119
Just look at this.

25:44.120 --> 25:46.199
Inside, smart, clean, functional.

25:46.200 --> 25:51.439
Everything the modern rail traveller
wants and demands.

25:51.440 --> 25:55.079
And at the back,
there was Jeremy's creation.

25:55.080 --> 25:57.799
This is the economy section.

25:57.800 --> 26:01.599
What I've done is I've fitted
benches and, on the floor, straw

26:01.600 --> 26:06.999
to absorb the diseases and the
blood, should there be a riot.

26:07.000 --> 26:11.639
Then, for an authentic
working-class feel, at the back,

26:11.640 --> 26:14.479
I fitted an outside khazi.

26:14.480 --> 26:17.639
Why have you called it 'scum class'?

26:17.640 --> 26:20.759
Good name. It's a bit blunt.
Honestly, think about it.
This way, it's an incentive.

26:20.760 --> 26:26.039
You're not going to walk into the
ticket office and go, "Hello, can
I have three scum-class tickets?"

26:26.040 --> 26:29.279
You're going to say, "Oh,
I'll spend a little bit more
so I don't have to say that."

26:29.280 --> 26:34.039
You'll say, "I'll have second
class." We'll make more profit.
We'll make more money. Exactly.

26:34.040 --> 26:37.359
With the carriages hooked up to
the Jag, we prepared ourselves

26:37.360 --> 26:41.959
for the maiden voyage
of the world's cheapest train.

26:41.960 --> 26:44.880
Engaging drive. Engage forwards.

26:52.120 --> 26:57.479
Not moving.
Be gentle with it. Gently!

26:57.480 --> 26:59.519
That's not working, is it?

26:59.520 --> 27:01.839
It says we're doing
80 miles an hour then.

27:01.840 --> 27:03.879
Get out and give us a push.

27:03.880 --> 27:05.959
How's he going to push it?

27:05.960 --> 27:08.360
Just get it started. When did you
ever see anybody push a train?

27:10.200 --> 27:13.520
Why won't it go? 300 horsepower.

27:18.320 --> 27:20.399
It's not working.
Why isn't it working?

27:20.400 --> 27:22.560
Because it's just spinning all its
power away and not going anywhere.

27:22.561 --> 27:26.239
Why? Well, one, you're
driving it like an oaf.

27:26.240 --> 27:29.039
I've done gentle!
You didn't do gentle.

27:29.040 --> 27:31.160
You just planted your foot on it
and went, "power!" as normally.

27:31.161 --> 27:35.559
Secondly, I'm sorry to say this,
but you've brought the wrong car.

27:35.560 --> 27:38.839
You did.
It's a rear-wheel-drive roadster.

27:38.840 --> 27:40.678
What do you want?
Do you want front-wheel drive?

27:40.679 --> 27:42.840
Possibly. Four-wheel drive
is where it wants to be.

27:42.841 --> 27:45.279
It's not the car.

27:45.280 --> 27:47.439
We've got too many carriages.
It's too heavy.

27:47.440 --> 27:49.440
Of course it's got carriages
on it, you muppet! It's a train!

27:49.441 --> 27:52.639
There are too many.
Actually, that's the bare minimum.

27:52.640 --> 27:55.359
We've got first-class, second class,
scum class, buffet. Real trains!

27:55.360 --> 27:57.359
No less. Well, it's too heavy.

27:57.360 --> 28:00.159
That's how much it weighs.

28:00.160 --> 28:03.520
We need a different locomotive.

28:05.080 --> 28:07.360
What about...

28:09.080 --> 28:11.519
A sports train? A what?

28:11.520 --> 28:14.879
A sports train. One carriage
and a car. It's a sports train.

28:14.880 --> 28:17.679
Well, that defeats the point
of it being a train, doesn't it?

28:17.680 --> 28:21.639
One carriage? Listen, you've got
sports cars, sports planes,
sports boats, sports jackets.

28:21.640 --> 28:25.119
You've got loads of those.

28:25.120 --> 28:30.079
People pay more for sports
experience. If it's got
one carriage, it's not a train.

28:30.080 --> 28:32.039
No - Train GTI.

28:32.040 --> 28:37.479
And you can sell tickets for
millions of pounds because everybody
will want to go in a sports train.

28:37.480 --> 28:42.639
All the trains are on the same line.
Might as well get a bigger, better
locomotive and put them together.

28:42.640 --> 28:45.479
That's why it's called a train.
I'm not changing the car.

28:45.480 --> 28:48.079
Well, we're doing a proper train.
Well, you haven't got a car.

28:48.080 --> 28:50.799
Well, we'll go and get one.
We'll get one.

28:50.800 --> 28:52.879
Uncouple me. Gladly.
Off you go.

28:52.880 --> 28:59.360
Jeremy departed, leaving us with the
task of finding a new locomotive.

29:01.080 --> 29:02.920
Oh, yeah. That's great!

29:08.480 --> 29:10.879
We shall pick that up later on.

29:10.880 --> 29:15.559
No, we will not.
Because what is wrong with my idea
for a sports train?

29:15.560 --> 29:17.399
It's stupid, you're an idiot.

29:17.400 --> 29:21.559
Are you suggesting, therefore,
that Isambard Kingdom Brunel,

29:21.560 --> 29:24.719
the greatest engineer who
ever lived, was an idiot?

29:24.720 --> 29:28.639
No. Because Brunel did not
suggest making a sports train.
Well, that's where you're wrong.

29:28.640 --> 29:34.679
Because I have a photograph here
of an engine designed to go on
Brunel's Great Western Railway.

29:34.680 --> 29:37.919
And look at that.

29:37.920 --> 29:40.759
What? In what way is that sporty?

29:40.760 --> 29:45.639
Let me explain. We think today of
a 20-inch rim as being very sporty.

29:45.640 --> 29:49.559
Look at that. That is a 96-inch rim.

29:49.560 --> 29:53.639
For goodness' sake.
Look at this, that is a fat exhaust.

29:53.640 --> 29:56.639
And, you will notice, one carriage.

29:56.640 --> 29:59.719
This is a Max Power train,
right here.

29:59.720 --> 30:04.279
Anyway, putting aside Jeremy's
ideas of Pimp My Stovepipe Hat,

30:04.280 --> 30:07.919
Hammond and I think we might be
onto something with our train.

30:07.920 --> 30:10.119
So we will, in fact,
pick that up later.

30:10.120 --> 30:14.599
We will. But now it is time to put
a Star in our Reasonably Priced Car.

30:14.600 --> 30:18.400
And my guest tonight is
quite simply... Rowan Atkinson!

30:22.600 --> 30:28.359
120 shows. Finally got you here.

30:28.360 --> 30:30.719
Thank you so much.

30:30.720 --> 30:33.239
Have a seat.

30:33.240 --> 30:35.240
Rowan Atkinson.

30:37.800 --> 30:41.799
So, Rowan,
obviously Not The Nine O'Clock News,

30:41.800 --> 30:44.799
Mr Bean you are, Blackadder.

30:44.800 --> 30:49.159
But may we begin by talking, if
you don't mind, about the Honda NSX?

30:49.160 --> 30:51.520
You are a fan, I believe, of the
Honda? I have owned one. Yes.

30:51.521 --> 30:57.199
And why, did you find that...?
Well, I liked its modesty.

30:57.200 --> 30:59.039
I liked its understatedness.

30:59.040 --> 31:01.439
I liked the fact
that it was a very good car.

31:01.440 --> 31:03.559
And yet it didn't shout itself.

31:03.560 --> 31:06.919
It was sort of image-free. I
think that's what I liked about it.

31:06.920 --> 31:09.278
This is nice, I like
talking to a man about cars.

31:09.279 --> 31:12.758
It's the only thing I can really
talk about. Yes, quite. Which is why
we've looked forward

31:12.759 --> 31:14.640
for some many years to have you on.

31:14.641 --> 31:17.959
Of course, the McLaren F1
was another one of your...

31:17.960 --> 31:20.999
Which I've still got. 14 years on.
You still have it? Yeah.

31:21.000 --> 31:23.320
That is more interesting.
Because I don't like that.

31:23.321 --> 31:26.039
I know, you've never
been wild about it.

31:26.040 --> 31:29.399
I don't know, you could live with
it. I've lived with it for 14 years.

31:29.400 --> 31:32.039
And I've done a lot of miles in it.

31:32.040 --> 31:34.599
I've done 37,000 miles.

31:34.600 --> 31:38.199
In a McLaren?
Which, for a McLaren, is a lot.

31:38.200 --> 31:40.719
And you actually lent yours to us,
I seem to recall?

31:40.720 --> 31:42.959
Unbelievable. Unbelievable.

31:42.960 --> 31:44.600
What on earth possessed you to say,

31:44.601 --> 31:47.879
"Yes, Top Gear have rung saying, can
they borrow my most prized
possessions?"

31:47.880 --> 31:50.800
I know,
for some reason I trusted you more
than most people trust you, Jeremy.

31:50.801 --> 31:54.679
It was Richard Hammond as well,
I believe, who has a reputation

31:54.680 --> 31:59.479
for driving in a straight line
with no incidents at all.
Oh, right, yes.

31:59.480 --> 32:03.319
You had an Aston Martin last time
we saw you in Johnny English. Yes.

32:03.320 --> 32:06.479
Which was a DB7. Yes, a DB7 Vantage.

32:06.480 --> 32:08.439
That shows how long ago it was.

32:08.440 --> 32:11.119
It was 2002 when we made
the first Johnny English.

32:11.120 --> 32:13.320
And, of course, now there is
another one. There is a new one.

32:13.321 --> 32:14.919
Johnny English Reborn.

32:14.920 --> 32:17.159
Reborn? I'm embarrassed to say,

32:17.160 --> 32:19.399
I haven't actually seen it.

32:19.400 --> 32:23.639
There's a very good reason for that,
because we haven't
actually finished it.

32:23.640 --> 32:26.359
But it's coming.
It's in the pipelines.

32:26.360 --> 32:29.599
It's out in September,
so you'll see it then.

32:29.600 --> 32:31.560
We have a sample of what's
going to be in the new movie.

32:31.561 --> 32:36.319
Hopefully some cars.
Some bits and bobs, yes.
Let's have a look at the clip.

32:36.320 --> 32:38.759
The world's greatest spy...

32:38.760 --> 32:43.640
Johnny English.
Work hard, play hard. Is back.

32:45.280 --> 32:47.439
And deadlier than ever.

32:47.440 --> 32:49.320
You've been away for some time,
English.

32:49.321 --> 32:52.320
But you haven't been forgotten.

32:53.880 --> 32:56.919
There is a plot to kill the Premier.

32:56.920 --> 33:00.320
Time is of the essence.
Where are we on security? English?

33:05.160 --> 33:06.920
Give me 24 hours.

33:08.840 --> 33:12.359
In 2011... My country needs me.

33:12.360 --> 33:15.199
It's Johnny English.
Let's kick some bottom.

33:15.200 --> 33:18.600
British intelligence...

33:20.840 --> 33:22.000
Fights back.

33:23.680 --> 33:25.439
Johnny!

33:25.440 --> 33:28.840
It's the killer from Hong Kong!
Murderous crone!

33:30.400 --> 33:33.759
I've got her!
You old hag! She's the killer!

33:33.760 --> 33:35.600
She's my mother! Granny!

33:41.040 --> 33:43.759
I thought the last one was
excellent. And that looks...

33:43.760 --> 33:46.959
You'd go and see that, wouldn't you?

33:46.960 --> 33:51.439
Obviously, let's talk
about the cars in there.
We saw a Rolls-Royce, the Phantom.

33:51.440 --> 33:53.040
Yeah, Rolls-Royce
Phantom coupe, exactly.

33:53.041 --> 33:57.319
I feel as though the Aston
thing has been a bit over done.

33:57.320 --> 33:59.678
It's in the James Bond movies
and we used it in the first film.

33:59.679 --> 34:01.680
I just felt like doing
something a bit different.

34:01.681 --> 34:07.079
I've become quite a fan of the
Phantom. But I wanted to give the
car we had a little USP.

34:07.080 --> 34:11.719
You know, some unique little thing
which no other Phantom had.

34:11.719 --> 34:15.559
Which was? Which was an engine.

34:15.560 --> 34:18.159
But not any engine.

34:18.159 --> 34:19.679
This was an engine...

34:19.679 --> 34:21.679
There's an interesting
story behind it.

34:21.679 --> 34:24.518
When BMW bought the rights to the
Rolls-Royce name

34:24.520 --> 34:27.918
in the late 20th century,
they had the opportunity to create

34:27.920 --> 34:30.438
the ultimate
luxury car for the 21st century.

34:30.440 --> 34:33.159
And they thought, "Maybe we ought
to give it the ultimate engine."

34:33.159 --> 34:39.039
So let's give it something like
a nine-litre V16 engine.

34:39.040 --> 34:42.918
And, unbelievably, they made
three or four of these
engines and they tested them.

34:42.920 --> 34:47.119
They got them up to speed
and they had unbelievable
power and torque figures.

34:47.120 --> 34:51.239
And then, at the last minute,
they thought, "Hmm, might
be a bit over the top."

34:51.239 --> 34:54.799
But they had developed these
engines and they'd stuck them
in the warehouse somewhere.

34:54.800 --> 34:58.039
And I knew that they existed,
so I got in touch with Rolls-Royce

34:58.040 --> 35:03.799
and said, "Would you mind squeezing
one of your V16 engines in the front
of our Johnny English Phantom?"

35:03.800 --> 35:06.799
Very sweetly, they agree to do it.
And it works, it's the real thing.

35:06.800 --> 35:12.239
So the car we have over there,
which is from the movie,
that's got a V16 engine in it?

35:12.240 --> 35:13.799
Yes, a nine litre V16 engine.

35:13.800 --> 35:15.520
That's amazing.
That's why its bonnet's up?

35:15.521 --> 35:17.919
I thought it had broken down.

35:17.920 --> 35:20.519
No, Jeremy, it hasn't broken down.

35:20.520 --> 35:22.599
I'm with you,
I'm a huge fan of the Phantom.

35:22.600 --> 35:27.759
I think it is one of the greatest
cars. And, of course, it fits
perfectly because the Phantom

35:27.760 --> 35:29.479
was designed for that engine.

35:29.480 --> 35:31.400
I want to talk, if I may,
just a bit about comedy.
We've talked about cars now.

35:31.401 --> 35:35.679
The comedy stuff, take Blackadder.

35:35.680 --> 35:40.119
Right. When you read that script and
there was somebody there called Bob.

35:40.120 --> 35:43.080
Anybody else would read it and go,
All right, they're called Bob."
You decided that

35:43.081 --> 35:44.879
Bob could be a funny word.

35:44.880 --> 35:47.839
Right. Bob.

35:47.840 --> 35:50.319
But how do you do that?

35:50.320 --> 35:53.279
It was always at
the end of the sentence.

35:53.280 --> 35:56.079
"So, how can I help you, Bob?"

35:56.080 --> 36:00.759
It just seemed like
a funny way of saying it. Bob.

36:00.760 --> 36:02.480
Because I was wondering, I was
looking at a list of motoring words

36:02.481 --> 36:06.359
the other day and wondering if you
could, just by saying them,
make them funny.

36:06.360 --> 36:10.240
Just say the word. Airbag.

36:12.000 --> 36:15.239
De Dion-Bouton.

36:15.240 --> 36:17.599
That's a French word, that.

36:17.600 --> 36:19.280
Petrol pump.

36:22.200 --> 36:24.959
Very good. Round of applause
for saying "petrol pump".

36:24.960 --> 36:29.319
Can I just say, it's also the
faces. Exactly, that helps.

36:29.320 --> 36:34.199
Reviewing the car, because I
have to think of all sorts of
things to say about a car.

36:34.200 --> 36:39.679
I know that if you were a
presenter on this show, you could
just do it with an expression.

36:39.680 --> 36:44.080
Right. So, for example, if you
were presented with a McLaren F1.

36:51.360 --> 36:55.439
Think of another one.
The imperiousness one
gets from a Range Rover.

36:55.440 --> 36:58.080
Ah, right, OK.

37:00.120 --> 37:03.479
LAUGHTER

37:03.480 --> 37:06.959
APPLAUSE

37:06.960 --> 37:08.320
Amazing!

37:11.920 --> 37:15.919
We have so much to learn. So,
obviously, you do love your cars.

37:15.920 --> 37:18.959
Yeah. Now, of course, you race.

37:18.960 --> 37:22.159
Yeah, occasionally.
Historic racing, yeah.

37:22.160 --> 37:24.639
So, what are you racing now?

37:24.640 --> 37:27.599
What I have got is a Ford Falcon,
1964 Ford Falcon.

37:27.600 --> 37:31.039
It's a big 4.7 litre V8,
and very, very light.

37:31.040 --> 37:33.120
Isn't that like land yachting?!

37:35.360 --> 37:38.799
Yes, exactly,
it's got a certain floppiness to it!

37:38.800 --> 37:41.719
So, obviously, driving the Kia...

37:41.720 --> 37:45.279
One of my worries about
coming on the show was

37:45.280 --> 37:47.239
that I think people know

37:47.240 --> 37:49.959
that I'm a car enthusiast
and that I have done some racing,

37:49.960 --> 37:52.759
and they will assume
that in the Reasonably Priced Car

37:52.760 --> 37:56.159
I'll be very good, when there's
no guarantee of that whatsoever.

37:56.160 --> 37:58.399
Because it is
a very particular thing,

37:58.400 --> 38:00.599
and I'm a slow learner of cars
and all that.

38:00.600 --> 38:03.040
But anyway, I was keen to have a go,
so I had a go.

38:03.041 --> 38:06.199
Who here would like to see
Rowan's lap?

38:06.200 --> 38:08.599
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

38:08.600 --> 38:10.640
Play the tape. Let's have a look.

38:13.640 --> 38:16.000
Like you were using launch control!

38:17.880 --> 38:20.759
Okey-dokey. Here we go.

38:20.760 --> 38:24.479
You look a bit nervous,
if I may say.

38:24.480 --> 38:27.999
Ooh, wide line, like
a Formula 1 driver through there.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.520
And wide on the way out as well.
Looking smooth.

38:40.680 --> 38:42.440
Hopeless, hopeless, hopeless.

38:43.440 --> 38:45.919
Yes, now, here we are,
into the Hammerhead,

38:45.920 --> 38:47.400
keeping it between the lines.

38:47.401 --> 38:49.759
Obviously, the slower
you appear to be going...

38:49.760 --> 38:53.159
and that does appear to be
very slow indeed...

38:53.160 --> 38:54.560
sometimes, the faster it is.

38:54.561 --> 38:58.200
That doesn't look too bad,
but what do you think from inside?

39:00.840 --> 39:02.279
Good, good, good.

39:02.280 --> 39:05.999
You really weren't pleased with
any part of this, were you?

39:06.000 --> 39:08.080
Obviously, flat through there.

39:10.240 --> 39:11.680
Not so good. Not so good, that.

39:11.681 --> 39:14.439
Come on, cheer up!
Yeah, that's nicely done.

39:14.440 --> 39:16.999
I say, keeping it very tight
on the runway.

39:17.000 --> 39:19.799
That's a new, interesting line.

39:19.800 --> 39:22.319
Second to last corner,
that is beautifully handled.

39:22.320 --> 39:27.679
And Gambon, no drama,
no histrionics, across the line.

39:27.680 --> 39:30.320
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

39:33.920 --> 39:35.279
Well.

39:35.280 --> 39:39.399
There's the board. Where do you
think you might have come?

39:39.400 --> 39:40.440
Who's at the very top?

39:40.441 --> 39:44.399
The man at the very top is
John Bishop, the northern comedian,

39:44.400 --> 39:48.839
followed by Ross Noble, the northern
comedian. I was born in the north.

39:48.840 --> 39:51.519
You're from the same neck of
the woods as Ross Noble.

39:51.520 --> 39:54.839
Indeed. You're looking at the top,
you have that...?

39:54.840 --> 39:56.559
No, exactly, one looks at that,

39:56.560 --> 39:59.919
but there's no reason
why I should be there.

39:59.920 --> 40:04.119
I felt as though I did OK,
but not great. That's my view.

40:04.120 --> 40:07.119
OK, at the very top is Bishop on,
what is he, 1:42.8.

40:07.120 --> 40:09.360
So, Rowan Atkinson. You did it...

40:10.360 --> 40:12.079
one...

40:12.080 --> 40:14.000
Good.

40:15.040 --> 40:16.920
..forty...

40:17.920 --> 40:19.039
Excellent.

40:19.040 --> 40:20.800
..two...

40:24.960 --> 40:25.999
..two.

40:26.000 --> 40:27.800
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

40:30.120 --> 40:35.120
Come on! That's the new fastest man
we've ever had on our track!

40:38.480 --> 40:43.160
Ladies and gentlemen, Rowan
Atkinson, the fastest man ever!

40:50.160 --> 40:52.759
It is actually remarkable,

40:52.760 --> 40:55.919
because we did genuinely think
when Bishop did that time

40:55.920 --> 40:59.639
and was so much faster than Tom
Cruise, it would never be beaten.

40:59.640 --> 41:01.959
No, the Tom Cruise thing
is fun, actually.

41:01.960 --> 41:04.159
And your lap times were
incredibly consistent,

41:04.160 --> 41:07.319
as is the mark
of a great racing driver.

41:07.320 --> 41:09.199
Pish and posh!

41:09.200 --> 41:11.479
Turns out
you're in the wrong career.

41:11.480 --> 41:16.839
So, a lot of people think you've
already been on this show. Yes.

41:16.840 --> 41:19.639
Ladies and gentlemen, he has now.
Rowan Atkinson!

41:19.640 --> 41:21.160
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

41:25.280 --> 41:27.799
Great time!

41:27.800 --> 41:31.000
"Petrol pump." I can't do it!

41:33.320 --> 41:38.479
Now, earlier on, we embarked on
a project to build a cheap train

41:38.480 --> 41:41.799
using an old Jaguar XJS
and some caravans.

41:41.800 --> 41:44.639
Yeah, and sadly, it didn't work,

41:44.640 --> 41:49.159
because Jeremy's driving was rubbish,
and he bought the wrong car.

41:49.160 --> 41:52.999
Then there was a really big argument
and he stormed off with the Jag,

41:53.000 --> 41:56.839
saying he was going to make
something called a sports train.

41:56.840 --> 41:59.839
Yeah, and that left Hammond and me
with all the coaches,

41:59.840 --> 42:01.520
but nothing to pull them with.

42:03.240 --> 42:05.719
'After a canter through
the classifieds,

42:05.720 --> 42:10.519
'Hammond and I found
our new locomotive.'

42:10.520 --> 42:14.679
Here's what Hammond and I have
bought instead. It's an Audi S8.

42:14.680 --> 42:18.519
It has even more power than the
Jaguar, but more importantly, it has

42:18.520 --> 42:21.359
four-wheel drive,
which is what you need,

42:21.360 --> 42:23.559
because the rails are slippery.

42:23.560 --> 42:29.159
Also, I have feet made of flesh,
with nerves in them,

42:29.160 --> 42:33.959
like a human being, not lumps of
lead yoked to an incompetent oaf.

42:33.960 --> 42:36.279
'While I was doing the driving,

42:36.280 --> 42:38.799
'Hammond would take care
of the passengers.'

42:38.800 --> 42:41.519
In just a few minutes,
I shall be welcoming the passengers

42:41.520 --> 42:44.079
onto the train. This is the manifest
with their names.

42:44.080 --> 42:47.279
But before I do that,
let's get the buffet car ready.

42:47.280 --> 42:48.759
This has to look good.

42:48.760 --> 42:53.159
This really is... All passengers -
first, second - will be able

42:53.160 --> 42:57.519
to come in here, so I want it
to look excellent.

42:57.520 --> 43:01.120
Biscuits, various. Muffins. Yeah.

43:02.560 --> 43:04.800
It's the carriage of plenty.

43:05.880 --> 43:08.720
'With the buffet ready,
it was time to greet our guests...

43:10.240 --> 43:13.239
'..who were a group of
top officials and inspectors

43:13.240 --> 43:15.160
'from the railway world.'

43:16.440 --> 43:18.159
You are? Steve Davies.

43:18.160 --> 43:21.079
Steve Davies. MBE!
Steve Davies, MBE! Indeed.

43:21.080 --> 43:24.319
And you're a colonel! Hello! How do
you do? Nice to see you again.

43:24.320 --> 43:27.879
You're in first,
which is there. Indeed.

43:27.880 --> 43:30.239
Hello, you're Helen...? Helen Ashby.

43:30.240 --> 43:32.399
OBE! Hello! Hi! Come on in, please.

43:32.400 --> 43:35.319
Thank you.
You're on first as well, obviously.

43:35.320 --> 43:39.199
And sir? Ian Walmsley.
Yes, you're also...

43:39.200 --> 43:42.319
Yes, in there, Ian,
that'll be absolutely brilliant.

43:42.320 --> 43:44.519
In. There you go, you'll be fine.

43:44.520 --> 43:46.960
The straw's fresh, don't worry.

43:49.680 --> 43:53.039
'Everything now depended on giving
our passengers the train ride

43:53.040 --> 43:54.600
'of a lifetime.'

43:56.040 --> 44:00.759
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome aboard the 14:53 express

44:00.760 --> 44:03.519
from just outside Leicester
to near Loughborough.

44:03.520 --> 44:06.079
This train is about to depart.
Thank you very much

44:06.080 --> 44:07.960
for travelling with us.
We appreciate

44:07.961 --> 44:10.599
that you have a choice
of car-based rail companies.

44:10.600 --> 44:14.279
James, that's my job!
I'm running this bit of the train.

44:14.280 --> 44:15.520
You just drive!

44:15.521 --> 44:17.919
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your steward,

44:17.920 --> 44:21.880
whose train this is. We will shortly
be departing towards Loughborough.

44:33.440 --> 44:34.480
Look at this!

44:36.080 --> 44:38.200
It's a train, and it works!

44:42.280 --> 44:44.280
HE LAUGHS

44:46.600 --> 44:48.440
This is the best thing
I've ever done!

44:52.080 --> 44:56.200
Ladies and gentlemen, I'll be through
shortly with refreshments.

44:57.320 --> 44:58.360
Oh, yeah!

45:04.040 --> 45:05.838
I don't know if this is
coming across

45:05.839 --> 45:07.680
in the images you're seeing at home,

45:07.681 --> 45:14.079
but the sensation of being in a car
but on the railway is just

45:14.080 --> 45:17.079
the maddest thing I've ever seen
out of the window.

45:17.080 --> 45:18.120
It's a railway!

45:37.040 --> 45:41.240
Past another train parked
in the siding. It's just wonderful.

45:42.920 --> 45:47.039
More points coming up. The
responsible driver slows down a bit.

45:47.040 --> 45:48.960
A tiny bit of braking.

45:51.440 --> 45:53.440
Refreshments, gentlemen!

46:01.200 --> 46:03.200
Oh, it doesn't fit!

46:06.640 --> 46:09.999
Across the little bridge,
the water on the left.

46:10.000 --> 46:11.839
'While I was sightseeing,

46:11.840 --> 46:14.639
'Jeremy was finally
leaving the station

46:14.640 --> 46:16.760
'in his idiotic sports train.'

46:19.880 --> 46:21.920
TGV 12 is up and running.

46:27.880 --> 46:32.199
Let me talk you through
my passengers.

46:32.200 --> 46:35.719
The man on the left, he's just
a man, but the man on the right,

46:35.720 --> 46:39.759
that is the editor
of Rail Express magazine,
and I need to impress him.

46:39.760 --> 46:41.960
He's going to be reviewing
this experience.

46:43.240 --> 46:47.479
'Clearly, the best way of impressing
him would be to beat Hammond and May

46:47.480 --> 46:49.479
'to our destination.'

46:49.480 --> 46:51.120
Come on! Let's build up that speed!

46:54.840 --> 46:56.760
Taking it up now to 40.

46:59.600 --> 47:01.599
45!

47:01.600 --> 47:04.679
A few bugs there smashing into
the face

47:04.680 --> 47:07.080
of the editor
Railway Express magazine.

47:11.160 --> 47:12.680
55!

47:15.120 --> 47:17.159
HE LAUGHS
Look!

47:17.160 --> 47:22.239
The wind in your hair,
the bees in your face!

47:22.240 --> 47:23.759
V12 power!

47:23.760 --> 47:26.479
The editor
of Railway Express magazine

47:26.480 --> 47:29.720
basking in the shadow
of my magnificence!

47:34.040 --> 47:35.479
Ugh, a train!

47:35.480 --> 47:37.079
HORN BLARES

47:37.080 --> 47:39.120
Oh, my God!

47:46.880 --> 47:51.080
'Meanwhile, further up the line,
May had also got his foot down.'

47:52.280 --> 47:54.400
25 miles an hour!

47:55.840 --> 47:59.400
'But this turn of speed was
causing a few problems.'

48:06.320 --> 48:11.160
The cruise control works.
Look at that! I'm now doing nothing.

48:16.680 --> 48:21.159
'It wasn't just the vibrations that
were bothering the inspectors...

48:21.160 --> 48:22.680
'the noise was also an issue.'

48:31.680 --> 48:33.799
What? Do you think it's safe?

48:33.800 --> 48:35.040
I can't hear you!

48:35.041 --> 48:37.000
Do you think it's safe? No.

48:38.720 --> 48:44.559
How do we communicate in
an emergency? We have to shout!

48:44.560 --> 48:47.559
Is there a communication cord
to stop the train? Yes, yes, yes.

48:47.560 --> 48:50.879
I'm going to check it, actually.
I'm about to ask the driver, Mr May,

48:50.880 --> 48:54.000
to slow down a little bit,
just while we're serving the drinks.

48:56.800 --> 48:59.960
James!

49:01.080 --> 49:03.080
JAMES!

49:04.920 --> 49:06.639
What's the matter?

49:06.640 --> 49:09.400
Can you slow down a bit?
Everything's falling off. Right.

49:11.560 --> 49:16.679
Meanwhile, I'd caught up with the
idiots but I couldn't get past,

49:16.680 --> 49:19.679
due to a railway network design
fault.

49:19.680 --> 49:22.759
Even here, we're stuck
behind caravans.

49:22.760 --> 49:27.079
If I'm honest, though, that
wasn't the most immediate problem.

49:27.080 --> 49:29.320
Oh, for God's sake.

49:31.280 --> 49:33.359
Oh, this is really bad.

49:33.360 --> 49:37.159
A member of the working
classes is now taking a dump

49:37.160 --> 49:40.400
in full view of the editor
of Railway Express Magazine.

49:42.320 --> 49:44.879
Oh, no.

49:44.880 --> 49:47.720
I'm very sorry about this.

49:49.240 --> 49:52.840
I can't just drive along like
this forever, I'm backing off.

49:54.360 --> 50:00.079
I decided to go back
in search of some
points where I could change tracks.

50:00.080 --> 50:03.400
I do apologise, I do apologise.

50:04.920 --> 50:11.199
With Jeremy going backwards,
James and I decided we had time
to stop at the next station.

50:11.200 --> 50:13.879
A tiny bit of braking.

50:13.880 --> 50:16.600
You see, this is how you drive
a train. It's about finesse.

50:22.880 --> 50:25.360
James, stop! James, stop!

50:31.600 --> 50:34.399
James, we're bloody miles off.

50:34.400 --> 50:36.240
I'm going to back up.

50:40.080 --> 50:43.959
Ladies and gentlemen, if you'd
like to stretch your legs at this
intermediate station,

50:43.960 --> 50:45.360
and apologies for the overshoot.

50:46.880 --> 50:51.319
That was an overshoot.
RICHARD: 'Stop doing the BLEEP-ing
announcements, that's my job!'

50:51.320 --> 50:54.439
Ladies and gentlemen, we're just
pulling into the station in case,

50:54.440 --> 50:58.440
you might want to stretch your legs,
perhaps, or maybe have a walk.

51:00.240 --> 51:02.040
Allow me, please.

51:11.000 --> 51:13.199
Bloody hell.

51:13.200 --> 51:16.799
You don't have to be
wearing a short skirt, do you?

51:16.800 --> 51:19.039
Thank you.

51:19.040 --> 51:23.319
I have just discovered a small
design fault with the TGV12.

51:23.320 --> 51:26.439
When going backwards, you
have to have the bonnet up
to keep the engine cool

51:26.440 --> 51:28.560
because obviously there's no
air going into the radiator.

51:28.561 --> 51:30.799
And I can't see
anything out of the back.

51:30.800 --> 51:36.920
So the first I'll know about a
derailment is when we hear death and
screaming from the rear carriage.

51:38.960 --> 51:42.719
Back at the station, the inspectors
were busy doing some inspecting.

51:42.720 --> 51:45.759
What was the noise decibel level?

51:45.760 --> 51:49.759
108, it peaked at. It's higher
than anything I've ever measured.

51:49.760 --> 51:53.799
Just under 60. That's not
wide enough for disabled access.

51:53.800 --> 51:55.359
Good for people with one arm.

51:55.360 --> 51:57.359
There's only one armrest.

51:57.360 --> 51:58.920
The flammability is what
worried me, actually.

51:58.921 --> 52:02.559
I think my general consideration,
it's not a train, it's a death-trap.

52:02.560 --> 52:07.319
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I hope
you enjoyed your brief stopover at
Quorn and Woodhouse station.

52:07.320 --> 52:10.199
We will now be departing
again for near Loughborough.

52:10.200 --> 52:12.599
Come on!

52:12.600 --> 52:17.360
Meanwhile,
I'd found the set of points where I
could switch to the other track.

52:18.880 --> 52:25.839
Yes. Now, this is more of a palaver
than on the motorway but I am now
in the overtaking lane.

52:25.840 --> 52:27.799
Yes, I am.

52:27.800 --> 52:30.880
Let's go and hunt down James May.

52:36.960 --> 52:39.159
We're really moving now!

52:39.160 --> 52:41.039
70 miles an hour!

52:41.040 --> 52:42.720
Yes!

52:44.360 --> 52:49.880
That massive rear spoiler,
providing the downforce we need.

52:52.720 --> 52:55.280
My passengers are looking thrilled.

52:58.040 --> 53:02.319
And now I would show May
that speed is right, speed is good.

53:02.320 --> 53:04.279
Speed works.

53:04.280 --> 53:09.439
There he is.
James May is about to be splashed

53:09.440 --> 53:12.560
by the mighty wheel-spinning TGV12.

53:18.680 --> 53:21.879
Clarkson?

53:21.880 --> 53:25.040
God, how did he do that?

53:26.880 --> 53:29.720
The sports train is invincible.

53:31.680 --> 53:37.079
Ever since the dawn of the
train it has been mired in this
sea of turgid practicality.

53:37.080 --> 53:40.359
Nobody's ever thought, "Let's make
an exciting train."

53:40.360 --> 53:43.200
And here I am, in just such a thing.

53:44.720 --> 53:47.639
On Hammond and May's train,

53:47.640 --> 53:52.639
it's just one long, dreary trail
of boredom.

53:52.640 --> 53:53.960
Brace! Brace!

54:02.240 --> 54:04.440
Some poo's come out.

54:13.160 --> 54:17.919
Ladies and gentlemen, particularly of
first class, with your OBEs and MBEs.

54:17.920 --> 54:22.560
Richard Hammond, your steward,
will be passing through
shortly with hot meals.

54:29.080 --> 54:30.839
Oh, wait a minute.

54:30.840 --> 54:37.079
Since hunting was banned,
one sees the horses frolicking
gaily in the fields, enjoying...

54:37.080 --> 54:40.799
Forgive me while I just back
off and have a bit of a gloat.

54:40.800 --> 54:44.159
If we look over here, we see
traditional farming methods.

54:44.160 --> 54:46.159
And I think that pretty
much covers the lecture.

54:46.160 --> 54:49.839
I'm just doing a lecture on the
countryside. Nothing to see here.

54:49.840 --> 54:51.439
And that's it.

54:51.440 --> 54:52.960
Now we'll be on our way.

54:54.560 --> 54:56.079
Oh, dear.

54:56.080 --> 54:57.600
Bye!

54:59.320 --> 55:01.439
People of first class.

55:01.440 --> 55:06.119
Once again, the editor of
Railway Express Magazine was
heading back towards Leicester.

55:06.120 --> 55:12.039
Although this time I had
at least found a novel way
of seeing where I was going.

55:12.040 --> 55:14.639
Ignore the enormous
locomotive behind me.

55:14.640 --> 55:17.999
It's a glitch, really. Not my fault.

55:18.000 --> 55:24.239
Our train was now certain of beating
Jeremy's to near Loughborough.

55:24.240 --> 55:26.799
This is just serene.

55:26.800 --> 55:30.880
However, in the buffet car,
things weren't going so well.

55:43.120 --> 55:45.080
Ladies and gentlemen,
please brace yourself.

55:45.081 --> 55:49.719
The incompetent steward is about to
pour tepid coffee into your crotch.

55:49.720 --> 55:53.119
Christ's sake, James! Stop making
BLEEP-ing announcements!

55:53.120 --> 55:55.079
That's my job, I'm the steward!

55:55.080 --> 55:57.599
You drive, I steward.

55:57.600 --> 56:02.279
It's my train and the driver makes
the bleeding announcements.
That's the way it is.

56:02.280 --> 56:05.439
I had finally found a passing point

56:05.440 --> 56:09.119
and was now back in the chase.

56:09.120 --> 56:11.279
Really shifting, now.

56:11.280 --> 56:13.360
Really, really, really moving.

56:16.440 --> 56:19.759
No time to lose.

56:19.760 --> 56:21.479
80mph.

56:21.480 --> 56:23.679
Meanwhile...

56:23.680 --> 56:25.239
♪ La la la la la la!

56:25.240 --> 56:29.439
♪ La la la la la la la! ♪

56:29.440 --> 56:33.520
Penis, penis, penis, penis, penis.
It's my Tannoy.

56:36.320 --> 56:37.919
Hello, chaps.

56:37.920 --> 56:39.840
Can I offer you refreshments?

56:41.360 --> 56:43.559
Have you got a coffee, please? No.

56:43.560 --> 56:47.720
Any chance of a Danish
pastry, please? No.

56:53.880 --> 56:56.839
I'll slow it down
by one mile an hour.

56:56.840 --> 57:00.799
This isn't the fastest train
in the world. I'm sure Jeremy
will claim his goes faster.

57:00.800 --> 57:04.199
But ours carries more people.
That's the point of a train.

57:04.200 --> 57:06.279
It's mass transport.

57:06.280 --> 57:08.480
What Jeremy's built,
essentially, is a business jet.

57:08.481 --> 57:13.559
But that's out of the reach
of the vast majority of people.

57:13.560 --> 57:17.280
There you go. Anything else
I can get you? Red wine? No.

57:21.560 --> 57:23.279
Oh, dear.

57:23.280 --> 57:26.960
It appears my colleagues
have a bit of a problem.

57:37.040 --> 57:38.799
James. What?

57:38.800 --> 57:40.679
Your train's on fire.

57:40.680 --> 57:43.160
Is it? Yes, it is. Right.

57:45.200 --> 57:47.239
Well, there we are.

57:47.240 --> 57:52.519
Once again, then,
it looked like I would be the first

57:52.520 --> 57:54.439
to our destination.

57:54.440 --> 57:56.519
Very nearly at the end now.

57:56.520 --> 57:59.079
And what an epic voyage
this has been.

57:59.080 --> 58:04.199
Leicester - well, nearly Leicester -
to the outskirts of Loughborough.

58:04.200 --> 58:06.279
A distance of nearly eight miles.

58:06.280 --> 58:08.999
And the sports train

58:09.000 --> 58:11.319
just about done it.

58:11.320 --> 58:14.199
Easing it down, now.

58:14.200 --> 58:17.359
Should imagine
there'll be a fanfare.

58:17.360 --> 58:20.559
The mayor of Loughborough is
almost certainly going to be here.

58:20.560 --> 58:23.239
Oh, he isn't.

58:23.240 --> 58:25.719
Nobody is.

58:25.720 --> 58:30.680
Not to worry, though, because
the great pioneers are often
unappreciated at first.

58:33.160 --> 58:34.719
Throughout this epic voyage,

58:34.720 --> 58:40.199
I have referred to this as either
the TGV12 or the sports train.

58:40.200 --> 58:42.680
But I don't think that's right.
I don't think that does it justice.

58:42.681 --> 58:45.559
I think that the editor and the
other man

58:45.560 --> 58:49.359
will agree that what you
are looking at here is the future.

58:49.360 --> 58:54.880
And all we must do now is
await the arrival of my
less successful colleagues.

58:59.280 --> 59:01.519
No, listen. If you ignore the fire,

59:01.520 --> 59:06.599
and the fact we didn't get where we
wanted to go, it was incredibly noisy

59:06.600 --> 59:10.359
and the fact that all the passengers
have run away... Apart from that,
it was a resounding success?

59:10.360 --> 59:13.439
Yes, I think we can only judge it to
be a success. It worked as a train.

59:13.440 --> 59:15.600
We came up with something
new and unique and brilliant.

59:15.601 --> 59:18.679
Well, I think as a concept...
Oh, hello. It's quite nice.

59:18.680 --> 59:21.880
But the fact is...
HORN BLARES

59:41.000 --> 59:43.199
Hold on. Woah, woah.

59:43.200 --> 59:49.159
Let's just get this straight,
your train was a total failure.
No, it was not.

59:49.160 --> 59:52.679
Well, where is it, then? Well,
some of it is in the atmosphere.

59:52.680 --> 59:55.559
The rest of this is
all over Leicestershire.

59:55.560 --> 59:58.639
Whereas mine is here. And already
her Majesty's government

59:58.640 --> 01:00:03.679
has been on the telephone asking if
they can have the rights to use this

01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:06.039
on the proposed
West Coast Main Line.

01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:08.599
Really? No, I made that up.

01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:11.680
I'll tell you who has been
in touch, though. The editor of
Railway Express Magazine. Excellent.

01:00:11.681 --> 01:00:15.279
He wrote a short view of
his journey and your train.
Would you like to hear it?

01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:16.959
Uh-huh. He says the following.

01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:18.999
"There was nothing to eat.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:22.559
"The ride was awful.
The noise was distressing."

01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:26.799
He spent most of the day
going backwards, he genuinely

01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:30.959
feared for his life
and he ended up covered in excrement.

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:35.599
So, it's exactly
like a normal train.

01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:37.159
Only much cheaper.

01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:40.599
And, on that bombshell,
it is time to end.

01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:42.279
Thank you very much for watching.

01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:44.519
Next week, we destroy Kent
with a tank.

01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:46.160
But, for now, good night.
