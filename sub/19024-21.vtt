00:02.840 --> 00:04.592
When you're dating a woman

00:04.680 --> 00:07.274
whose husband just died
after two years in a coma,

00:07.360 --> 00:10.318
you can't help but have doubts
about the relationship.

00:10.400 --> 00:13.437
I guess all you can do is
be a man and face those doubts.

00:13.520 --> 00:15.556
What are you thinking about?

00:15.640 --> 00:17.312
Eggs.

00:17.400 --> 00:20.073
One minute they're bad for you,
now everybody's,

00:20.160 --> 00:22.674
"You tried eggs? They're great."
It's crazy.

00:22.760 --> 00:25.911
- Eggs.
- You know what? Forget I asked.

00:26.000 --> 00:27.797
What?

00:27.880 --> 00:30.110
I really wanted tonight
to be romantic.

00:30.200 --> 00:31.792
Sweetie, it is.

00:31.880 --> 00:34.314
No, exactly how much feeling

00:34.400 --> 00:36.630
am I supposed to lose
in my extremities?

00:36.720 --> 00:39.632
Just enough so it still hurts.

00:41.880 --> 00:44.678
Still, things are going pretty well
with me and Jamie.

00:48.320 --> 00:50.356
Looks like rope burn to me.

00:50.440 --> 00:53.113
Oh, no, this is a rash
from my new watch.

00:53.200 --> 00:55.839
They didn't tell me
the band was made of...

00:55.920 --> 00:57.273
Cat.

00:57.360 --> 01:00.079
Elliot, check out these wedding dresses.

01:02.280 --> 01:04.191
I'm so proud of you right now.

01:04.280 --> 01:06.350
This is exactly like the dress I bought.

01:07.120 --> 01:11.272
I didn't buy a wedding dress. I'm not
dating anybody, so that would be crazy,

01:11.360 --> 01:13.749
whether it was half off or not.

01:15.720 --> 01:18.712
There is not one good thing
about a wedding I can't afford.

01:18.800 --> 01:21.917
Turk, I know it's silly,
and I know it's only for one day,

01:22.000 --> 01:23.911
but ever since I was a little girl

01:24.000 --> 01:26.753
all I wanted to do
was have a big, beautiful wedding.

01:26.840 --> 01:29.479
What's the name of that designer
you love so much?

01:29.560 --> 01:31.551
She made that gown? Vera?

01:31.640 --> 01:33.949
Wang.

01:34.040 --> 01:35.792
You're the only two doctors

01:35.880 --> 01:38.269
immature enough
to laugh at the name Vera Wang.

01:38.360 --> 01:40.749
- Hello.
- Go ahead.

01:40.840 --> 01:43.274
What? Vera Wang
makes very beautiful gowns.

01:43.360 --> 01:46.158
Plus, her last name
is a very funny word for penis.

01:46.240 --> 01:48.276
Who's with me? Air-five.

01:53.320 --> 01:55.311
- Shorts, huh?
- Yeah.

01:55.400 --> 01:58.119
I don't get to wear shorts
cos I'm a lowly janitor?

01:58.200 --> 02:01.237
- I didn't say lowly.
- So now I'm a janitor?

02:01.320 --> 02:02.673
Yes.

02:02.760 --> 02:05.399
- Have you been drinking?
- I'm not drunk.

02:05.480 --> 02:08.277
I love your shorts.
I wish I had a pair just like them.

02:09.800 --> 02:12.268
OK, the angioplasty went well.

02:12.360 --> 02:14.715
But here's the thing.
It is on you, partner.

02:14.800 --> 02:18.679
Watch what you eat so that
we can kick this thing in the ass.

02:18.760 --> 02:21.752
- It's on you, partner.
- Oh, gosh, Shannon.

02:21.840 --> 02:26.630
Thank you so much for clarifying
my point by repeating it word for word.

02:26.720 --> 02:28.358
In a reciprocal gesture,

02:28.440 --> 02:31.637
am I included in the planning
of your coming-out party?

02:31.720 --> 02:34.154
- Is that a gay joke?
- No, it's a cotillion joke.

02:34.240 --> 02:37.994
My God, Newbie, it's been
two furiously frustrating years.

02:38.080 --> 02:40.799
How is it possible
that you still don't get me?

02:40.880 --> 02:43.758
I would never compare you
to the gays. I like the gays.

02:43.840 --> 02:46.308
I like their music.
I like their sense of style.

02:46.400 --> 02:48.550
I like what they've done with Halloween.

02:48.640 --> 02:51.791
But our thing
is that you're a little girl.

02:51.880 --> 02:54.030
That's who you are.
But that's not fair...

02:54.120 --> 02:57.874
Man, once Dr Cox gets on a roll,
nothing can derail him.

02:57.960 --> 02:59.916
My mom died.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.514
Except that.

03:06.000 --> 03:12.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:22.280 --> 03:24.430
Thank you for coming.
I know you're busy.

03:24.520 --> 03:28.195
It's tough working in a hospital.
No matter what is going on in your life,

03:28.280 --> 03:31.078
you have to dive right back
into the middle of things.

03:33.240 --> 03:35.117
So anyway, you said you like mine.

03:35.200 --> 03:37.236
I had the wife
whip up a pair for you.

03:37.320 --> 03:39.675
- You like 'em?
- Do I like 'em?

03:39.760 --> 03:41.512
The other day I was asking myself,

03:41.600 --> 03:43.158
how can I display my package

03:43.240 --> 03:45.515
in a way that's alluring
and professional?

03:45.600 --> 03:47.352
Well, there's your answer.

03:51.640 --> 03:53.870
To be young and in shorts.

03:55.960 --> 03:59.350
- Are you ready for bed?
- Oh, I'm ready.

03:59.440 --> 04:01.476
A lot can change in a week.

04:02.960 --> 04:06.350
Scoot. Can you hand
my mouth guard to me?

04:08.640 --> 04:09.834
Thanks.

04:13.560 --> 04:17.439
JD, if things have fizzled,
I could scout her out for you.

04:17.519 --> 04:19.158
Things haven't fizzled.

04:19.240 --> 04:22.596
Last night, we made ice cubes
out of orange juice. Step off.

04:22.680 --> 04:25.319
OK, gang, before we begin,

04:25.400 --> 04:27.436
Dr Kelso wants me to remind you

04:27.520 --> 04:29.351
of the legal ramifications

04:29.440 --> 04:32.113
of all your teensy snafus.

04:32.200 --> 04:34.077
Teensy snafus?

04:34.160 --> 04:37.755
Good God, Ted.
It's not a Dr Seuss story.

04:39.160 --> 04:40.878
Now, listen up, nametags.

04:40.960 --> 04:43.838
Over 50 per cent of our lawsuits
can be traced back

04:43.920 --> 04:46.195
to poor patient-doctor communication.

04:46.280 --> 04:50.193
To that end, if any of you still feel
the need to flap your babble holes,

04:50.280 --> 04:52.748
you will be joining me
in my new daily seminar

04:52.840 --> 04:54.592
on doctor-patient relations.

04:54.680 --> 04:58.673
My first invitee will be Dr Murphy,
whom I overheard telling someone,

04:58.760 --> 05:01.752
"Stop bleeding,
oh, God, please stop bleeding."

05:01.840 --> 05:05.515
- It was a gusher.
- Next catastrophe.

05:05.600 --> 05:07.352
Idiots.

05:07.440 --> 05:10.591
I hate him so much.

05:10.680 --> 05:13.399
Save it for our weekend bike ride.

05:15.880 --> 05:18.917
Would you like to try
one of my world-famous devilled eggs?

05:19.000 --> 05:21.468
No, thank you,
I've already had diarrhoea.

05:21.560 --> 05:24.711
Carla,
I just wanted to see how you're...

05:26.160 --> 05:30.039
It's always tough when you
have to bury your old mom, isn't it?

05:33.200 --> 05:36.397
- How was your mother's funeral?
- Don't know, skipped it.

05:36.480 --> 05:39.074
My aunt told my father
it was very moving.

05:41.760 --> 05:42.875
Gosh.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.791
Wow, the past and the present.

05:49.200 --> 05:51.668
Whenever I see two women
I've been intimate with

05:51.760 --> 05:54.877
talking to each other,
I always have the same fantasy.

05:54.960 --> 05:56.552
C'mon, ladies.

05:56.640 --> 05:59.359
It's right hand, left hand,
shoulder pop, jump.

06:15.920 --> 06:18.434
- What you talking about?
- Not the Rerun Dance.

06:18.520 --> 06:20.112
I tell her way too much.

06:20.200 --> 06:22.156
You left some stuff at my apartment.

06:22.240 --> 06:24.595
- Thanks.
- See ya.

06:25.640 --> 06:28.074
Wanna know why things with Jamie
are so lamey?

06:28.160 --> 06:30.913
- We're doing fine.
- She's clearing you out.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.390
Wrong. She came by because
she knows today at work I need my

06:35.000 --> 06:36.991
squash goggles.

06:37.080 --> 06:39.071
I have to saw something later.

06:39.160 --> 06:41.116
She's a drama queen, JD.

06:41.200 --> 06:44.112
When her husband was in a coma,
it was taboo and exciting,

06:44.200 --> 06:46.634
but now that it's OK
for you to be together,

06:46.720 --> 06:48.711
the relationship's got no snap.

06:48.800 --> 06:51.234
It's got no crackle.

06:51.320 --> 06:54.437
JD, it's got no pop.

06:54.520 --> 06:56.795
I know, because I'm a drama queen, too.

06:56.880 --> 06:59.075
Well, Jamie's not like you, OK?

07:01.680 --> 07:02.874
No pop!

07:04.760 --> 07:08.958
Nine pounds in a week?
Let me ask you a quick question.

07:09.040 --> 07:11.190
Are you trying
to make my head explode?

07:11.280 --> 07:13.953
Because you have no idea
just how frustrating it is

07:14.040 --> 07:16.873
working your ass off trying to inflate

07:16.960 --> 07:19.918
a tiny little balloon
inside someone's clogged artery

07:20.000 --> 07:22.912
and all that person has to do, really,
is, I don't know,

07:23.000 --> 07:26.629
go for a walk in the morning
or choke down a fresh green salad

07:26.720 --> 07:28.950
and you come back here
looking like that.

07:29.040 --> 07:32.828
I know. Here I am,
supposed to be Dr Give-A-Crap.

07:32.920 --> 07:36.993
You wanna know the God's honest truth?
This is a fact. You are what you eat.

07:37.080 --> 07:40.629
You clearly went out
and devoured a big fat guy, didn't ya?

07:42.240 --> 07:46.552
See, Dr Cox,
this is the sort of hostile behaviour

07:46.640 --> 07:49.074
that can cause us legal difficulty.

07:49.160 --> 07:51.913
Ted, I just might rip that tie
off your neck

07:52.000 --> 07:53.877
and jam it down your oesophagus.

07:53.960 --> 07:57.270
I think you proved at Nurse Roberts'
above-ground pool party

07:57.360 --> 08:00.875
- that doesn't solve anything.
- Dammit, you can't just go around

08:00.960 --> 08:03.554
browbeating nut jobs
and bullying fatties.

08:03.640 --> 08:07.428
I'm not a resident, so I'm not
going to your lame-ass seminar

08:07.520 --> 08:09.431
so in essence there, Big Bob,

08:09.520 --> 08:13.911
there's really nothing
you can do to me at all, is there?

08:14.000 --> 08:17.390
Hello, class.
My name is Dr Perry Cox.

08:17.480 --> 08:20.074
I'm going to be your teacher.

08:20.160 --> 08:22.037
No.

08:38.200 --> 08:39.188
You OK?

08:39.280 --> 08:41.919
Great.
What are you doing home so early?

08:42.000 --> 08:44.116
I just came to check on you.

08:44.200 --> 08:46.350
You looking at pictures?

08:48.280 --> 08:49.429
Yeah.

08:50.480 --> 08:53.472
I know she was old.

08:53.560 --> 08:56.996
Still, she was my best friend.

08:57.080 --> 09:00.277
I mean, what are you supposed to do
without your mom?

09:02.840 --> 09:06.594
You can let your man
fill a little bit of the hole she left.

09:08.320 --> 09:10.231
She would like that.

09:13.080 --> 09:15.594
- Baby, she hated me.
- Yeah, she did.

09:20.240 --> 09:23.038
- Holy...
- Calm down.

09:23.120 --> 09:25.793
- I didn't mean to scare you.
- Why are we whispering?

09:25.880 --> 09:28.440
To see if you would whisper
because I whispered.

09:28.520 --> 09:31.114
- I think I would.
- Anyway, what's the deal?

09:31.200 --> 09:33.839
We're shorts buddies today.
You saw the schedule.

09:33.920 --> 09:36.388
Monday, Tuesday, shorts,
Wednesday, wash 'em,

09:36.480 --> 09:39.756
Thursday, Friday. Weekend, optional.
I'll be wearing shorts.

09:39.840 --> 09:42.718
You know, I was gonna wear them,
but someone stole 'em.

09:42.800 --> 09:45.633
- What? Let me see.
- Yes.

09:45.720 --> 09:48.280
As a doctor, you get good
at thinking on your feet.

09:48.360 --> 09:50.430
I protected the janitor's feelings.

09:50.520 --> 09:52.829
Plus, he totally bought it.

10:02.440 --> 10:05.477
This burger's really meaty.

10:05.560 --> 10:08.950
I'm serious. You can taste all the meat.

10:09.040 --> 10:11.759
You know, I'm actually
gonna go put my sweats on.

10:11.840 --> 10:13.319
You're wearing sweats.

10:13.400 --> 10:15.152
You know, I gotta get up early,

10:15.240 --> 10:17.708
so maybe you should crash
at your place tonight.

10:17.800 --> 10:21.236
She probably does have to
get up early. So just be cool.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.275
I'm sorry.
It was a total accident, I just...

10:25.360 --> 10:29.797
Don't lie to me. I asked you to go,
so you punched through my coffee table.

10:29.880 --> 10:32.030
Oh, my God,
she does want drama.

10:32.120 --> 10:35.112
Sometimes you make me so crazy.

10:36.680 --> 10:39.717
Come here, I'll take care of you.

10:40.760 --> 10:44.992
This is totally normal. In relationships
you have to roll with the punches.

10:46.360 --> 10:48.351
Even the ones you don't see coming.

10:48.440 --> 10:52.797
If there were anything I could do
to make you feel better, I'd do it.

10:56.040 --> 10:57.712
Let's get married now.

11:04.920 --> 11:06.638
She wants to get married now?

11:06.720 --> 11:10.315
- She says spontaneity is romantic.
- Wow, that is romantic.

11:10.400 --> 11:12.994
- So how pregnant is she?
- She's not pregnant.

11:13.080 --> 11:15.913
I was getting really psyched
for this whole wedding.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.356
The dancing, the band.
You'd hook up with Carla's sister.

11:19.440 --> 11:21.351
- Which one?
- The drunkest one.

11:21.440 --> 11:24.318
There's no bachelor party,
and you being the best man,

11:24.400 --> 11:27.073
I know you would've hooked it up.

11:27.160 --> 11:29.549
All right, guys, let's make it happen.

11:43.760 --> 11:45.273
Dude.

11:46.880 --> 11:48.836
It would've been awesome.

11:48.920 --> 11:52.310
I'm having a hard time
getting excited about all of this.

11:52.400 --> 11:56.075
You work here so I guess we could do
the whole ceremony for 40 bucks.

11:56.160 --> 11:57.673
Praise Jesus!

11:57.760 --> 12:00.513
As for my relationship,
I was doing anything I could

12:00.600 --> 12:02.431
to keep the drama alive.

12:02.520 --> 12:06.399
Jamie and I are gonna be together,
and I don't care what you think, Mom.

12:08.880 --> 12:12.429
Because I don't want salad, that's why.

12:12.520 --> 12:16.035
Jamie and I will be together.
I don't care what you think, Dad.

12:19.320 --> 12:21.595
I'm warning you,
stop eyeballing my woman.

12:21.680 --> 12:24.831
Actually, JD, I think it was that guy.

12:24.920 --> 12:28.151
No, it was definitely that guy.

12:28.240 --> 12:30.595
Unfortunately,
I was running out of ideas.

12:30.680 --> 12:33.672
- How's the drama queen doing?
- I don't know, how are you?

12:35.520 --> 12:39.479
- Why can't you admit I'm right?
- Because you're not right.

12:39.560 --> 12:41.710
No pop.

12:43.560 --> 12:45.118
What was that all about?

12:45.200 --> 12:47.236
I wouldn't stoop this low for drama.

12:47.320 --> 12:49.038
Well, we used to be a couple.

12:49.120 --> 12:51.554
Now you're in the picture,
who wants me back?

12:51.640 --> 12:54.313
- Fine, I'd stoop.
- She better watch it.

12:54.400 --> 12:57.756
Lester, honey, I don't want you
using the stove on your own.

12:57.840 --> 13:00.229
Nurse, I asked for an extra pillow
an hour ago.

13:00.320 --> 13:04.472
I'm talking to my husband.
Why don't you get your own pillow?

13:04.560 --> 13:05.993
What?

13:06.080 --> 13:08.435
And they stuck you in here for that?

13:08.520 --> 13:11.751
I apologised to the old man.
Anybody can have a bad day.

13:11.840 --> 13:13.910
And what about you there, Beavis?

13:14.000 --> 13:15.672
Oh, uh...

13:15.760 --> 13:19.594
You know, I'm getting a little tired
of the sexual innuendo.

13:20.960 --> 13:23.190
In your endo.

13:23.280 --> 13:25.157
That's great stuff.

13:26.800 --> 13:29.758
Ted, why don't you be a sport
and get us started?

13:32.360 --> 13:35.670
- People, we're here today...
- Snore.

13:35.760 --> 13:39.036
New idea. All clam up for an hour
so I can get some shuteye.

13:39.120 --> 13:42.317
- Oh, and nervous guy?
- Yes, Dr Cox?

13:42.400 --> 13:46.029
If I were you, I'd swallow that
entire mouthful of baby carrots.

13:46.120 --> 13:48.190
If I hear you make
one more damn crunch,

13:48.280 --> 13:53.195
I'll use the rest of the carrots in that
bag to make you completely airtight.

14:00.040 --> 14:02.349
- Hey, Jamie.
- Hey, slut.

14:04.640 --> 14:06.870
I can totally explain
why Jamie said that.

14:06.960 --> 14:10.509
You know Turk says, "Hey, player."
when he means, "Hey, buddy."

14:10.600 --> 14:14.912
Jamie's from Cincinnati
and in Cincinnati they say "Hey, slut."

14:16.120 --> 14:17.314
Neat.

14:17.400 --> 14:19.834
Are you sure
you're happy we're doing this?

14:19.920 --> 14:21.990
Are you kidding?
It's my ideal wedding.

14:22.080 --> 14:24.514
It's cheap, there's no hassle,

14:24.600 --> 14:26.875
plus you said
you'd call my mom and explain.

14:26.960 --> 14:28.632
No, I didn't.

14:28.720 --> 14:31.359
- What's in it for me?
- This.

14:33.280 --> 14:35.430
My God!

14:35.520 --> 14:38.751
Give me the phone.
I'll call her right now.

14:38.840 --> 14:43.436
- You are such a mama's boy.
- Please. Dial Mommy.

14:43.520 --> 14:45.795
Dammit, Perry, you're there to teach.

14:45.880 --> 14:48.553
If I wanted somebody
to lay around and do nothing,

14:48.640 --> 14:52.189
I would've wheeled in a corpse,
or my housekeeper, Rosalba.

14:52.280 --> 14:55.909
Captain Clip-On.
Did you go ahead and tattle on me?

14:56.000 --> 14:58.434
Oh, please, with the shocked look.

14:58.520 --> 15:00.988
Newsflash, I'm sterile.

15:02.240 --> 15:03.992
I mean, gutless.

15:05.760 --> 15:09.469
My guys swim in circles.

15:09.560 --> 15:12.279
I think it's the bike riding.

15:15.680 --> 15:17.830
- Hey, Elliot.
- Hey, slut!

15:17.920 --> 15:20.036
- Excuse me?
- Carla!

15:20.120 --> 15:23.829
Could you give us a second?
I got to talk to her privately.

15:23.920 --> 15:25.797
Thank you.

15:25.880 --> 15:28.474
I just wanted to say
you were right about Jamie.

15:28.560 --> 15:30.710
What does Jamie
think you're doing here?

15:30.800 --> 15:33.837
Saying not to show up at
my apartment drunk, naked, crying.

15:33.920 --> 15:37.151
You know what's weird?
I really like this girl,

15:37.240 --> 15:39.913
but I'm not sure I carry it on
without all the drama.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.959
You have to gamble that once the drama's
gone, there'll be something there.

15:44.040 --> 15:47.669
If not, it's her loss.
Still, if it helps...

15:48.960 --> 15:50.871
Thanks.

15:53.280 --> 15:55.589
OK, here we go.

15:55.680 --> 15:58.911
When hospital employees
fail to communicate with patients,

15:59.000 --> 16:01.878
there are ethical
and legal ramifications that lead

16:01.960 --> 16:04.793
to financial hardship
and grievances against...

16:05.560 --> 16:07.630
...doctors.

16:07.720 --> 16:11.030
This is useless. I thought we
were going to learn something.

16:11.120 --> 16:13.588
Barbie? Why did they toss you in here?

16:13.680 --> 16:18.879
They didn't. I'm auditing.

16:18.960 --> 16:20.598
Fine.

16:20.680 --> 16:22.432
If you wanna know the real skinny.

16:22.520 --> 16:24.556
If you wanna be good doctors and nurses,

16:24.640 --> 16:27.712
you'd damn sure better get ready
to get in trouble a lot,

16:27.800 --> 16:30.758
because patients are stupid
and they are really scared.

16:30.840 --> 16:34.355
Some of them need you
to hold their hands, and you should.

16:34.440 --> 16:37.750
Others need you to kick their asses,
and you should do that too.

16:37.840 --> 16:40.229
It comes down to whether
you have the guts to say

16:40.320 --> 16:44.632
what you know in your heart of hearts
you really should say...

16:44.720 --> 16:48.872
So, Ted, how's Professor Cox doing?

16:48.960 --> 16:50.791
Excellent, sir.

16:52.160 --> 16:53.991
You know what else?

16:54.080 --> 16:56.230
- I quit.
- No, you don't.

16:56.320 --> 16:57.878
Well, I'm leaving early.

16:57.960 --> 17:00.633
No, you're coming to my office
and doing busy work.

17:00.720 --> 17:02.756
Fine, but I'm getting a soda first.

17:02.840 --> 17:04.114
Whatever.

17:17.839 --> 17:20.957
- Doctor...
- Janitor.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.508
- What's that smell?
- I don't know.

17:23.599 --> 17:26.592
Although it smells a little bit like
the truth.

17:27.760 --> 17:30.797
My poor wife slaved over these.

17:30.880 --> 17:33.838
She just cut off a pair of scrubs
and hemmed the bottom.

17:33.920 --> 17:36.388
- What's the big deal?
- What's the big deal?

17:36.480 --> 17:39.153
The Lord didn't bless my wife
with all ten fingers.

17:39.240 --> 17:42.152
She's only got pointer and thumb-pinky.

17:43.920 --> 17:47.833
Look, I'm sorry, OK,
for so many things.

17:47.920 --> 17:50.912
But I'm a doctor.
I can't really wear shorts to work.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.150
- You can't wear shorts to work?
- Nope.

17:54.280 --> 17:57.192
- You can't wear shorts to work?
- Not allowed.

18:00.280 --> 18:03.636
Thanks.
What's up with the man-thong?

18:03.720 --> 18:06.632
Oh, nothing,
I'm just trying to mend some fences.

18:08.160 --> 18:11.914
Do you think Elliot's somewhere
right now, crying her eyes out?

18:12.000 --> 18:14.275
Oh, without a doubt.

18:14.360 --> 18:16.430
But not about me.

18:18.480 --> 18:20.391
I kinda made all that stuff up.

18:20.480 --> 18:23.153
It just seems like
you and I only really click

18:23.240 --> 18:25.231
when something crazy's going on.

18:27.280 --> 18:30.909
I guess I don't really wanna be
in a relationship like that.

18:31.000 --> 18:34.117
- Is that an ultimatum?
- No, Jamie.

18:34.200 --> 18:37.749
No, it's not an ultimatum.
It's just something to think about.

18:39.760 --> 18:42.035
Oh, shoot, I gotta go.

18:44.760 --> 18:48.355
- You guys are having problems?
- Yeah.

18:50.400 --> 18:52.960
Hey, sorry I'm late.

18:53.040 --> 18:56.794
Well, it's just not a wedding without
a Dallas Cowboy cheerleader, is it?

18:56.880 --> 18:59.997
- Are you ready, sweetie?
- Since the day I met you.

19:00.080 --> 19:03.470
Sometimes it takes a priest to keep you
from making a big mistake.

19:03.560 --> 19:06.950
Christopher, before we begin,
remind me of the bride's name.

19:07.040 --> 19:08.871
Carla.

19:12.800 --> 19:16.554
I know it's silly and it's only for
one day, but since I was a little girl,

19:16.640 --> 19:19.313
all I wanted to do
was have a big, beautiful wedding.

19:19.400 --> 19:22.915
- Baby, you don't wanna do this.
- What?

19:23.000 --> 19:25.878
Since your mother passed,
you've been feeling lonely

19:25.960 --> 19:27.791
and like you don't have any family.

19:27.880 --> 19:30.314
I'm your family now,
whether we do it like this

19:30.400 --> 19:33.198
or we wait and do it
like you've always wanted to.

19:38.400 --> 19:42.075
Holy cow, talk about
your gigantic time wasters.

19:42.160 --> 19:43.878
Tell me about it.

19:43.960 --> 19:46.269
Lighten up, slut!

19:46.360 --> 19:48.430
What now?

19:48.520 --> 19:52.149
I think relationships can be defined
by big moments that don't happen.

19:56.040 --> 19:58.270
Or by the little ones that do.

19:59.280 --> 20:01.191
That's the stuff.

20:02.440 --> 20:05.591
But once you get past the drama
it's actually pretty simple.

20:12.760 --> 20:18.073
All we have to do is whatever it takes
to make her happy.

20:18.160 --> 20:20.993
4,606?

20:21.080 --> 20:23.640
- Y eah.
- Y eah.
