WEBVTT

02:19.973 --> 02:21.057
What?

02:21.391 --> 02:23.643
I was wondering if everything was okay.

02:24.394 --> 02:26.104
Why wouldn't it be?

02:26.312 --> 02:28.982
You know, like if there's a leak, or...

02:29.065 --> 02:30.150
This isn't a greenhouse.

02:31.276 --> 02:32.902
Or a power outage.

02:35.029 --> 02:36.447
I guess not.

02:37.448 --> 02:39.784
You could have been scared by the thunder.

02:40.577 --> 02:42.078
-Were you scared?
-Me?

02:42.662 --> 02:44.247
No. Why would I be?

02:45.123 --> 02:49.544
I thought you ladies may have been scared.
That's why I came to check.

02:49.627 --> 02:50.545
We're not scared.

02:51.963 --> 02:53.840
How about a snack? We can cook.

02:53.923 --> 02:54.966
This late?

02:55.842 --> 02:57.927
I'll cook. Jin-myung, I'll cook for you.

02:58.720 --> 03:00.638
I get sick if I eat late at night.

03:03.016 --> 03:04.684
Eun-jae. What about a board game?

03:04.767 --> 03:07.228
I have a whole bunch downstairs,
like Jenga...

03:07.312 --> 03:08.271
I'm sorry.

03:08.521 --> 03:10.565
Board games aren't fun for me.

03:12.066 --> 03:14.527
Ji-won. Why don't the three of us...

03:15.153 --> 03:16.237
play Go-Stop?

03:16.321 --> 03:19.240
I don't know how to play.
Surprising, right?

03:21.200 --> 03:24.329
Okay, then you and I play alone
all night long, okay?

03:24.495 --> 03:25.830
Have a good night.

03:31.711 --> 03:33.338
Such heartless city girls.

03:37.550 --> 03:39.510
I'm not scared.

03:39.677 --> 03:40.637
I'm not scared.

04:14.003 --> 04:17.465
EPISODE 8
SELF-DISHONESTY #Confessions

04:20.134 --> 04:22.762
Whore

04:27.225 --> 04:28.518
It's Doo-young.

04:29.269 --> 04:30.270
It's Doo-young.

04:31.562 --> 04:33.022
It was Doo-young after all.

04:34.565 --> 04:35.566
It's the pink letter.

04:39.362 --> 04:40.571
It must be Doo-young.

04:41.155 --> 04:42.865
No, it can't be.

04:44.409 --> 04:46.619
He was sentenced to a year and half.

04:46.703 --> 04:48.079
He should be in jail.

04:48.162 --> 04:50.415
She's right.
It's too soon to make conclusions.

04:51.958 --> 04:53.626
That's right. We don't know yet.

04:55.795 --> 04:57.839
Do you know who Doo-young is?

04:57.922 --> 05:00.174
That's right. How do you know him?

05:00.800 --> 05:03.052
Well... I was just...

05:03.511 --> 05:06.723
I'm saying we shouldn't be scared yet
since we don't know for sure.

05:11.060 --> 05:13.604
Have you heard any about Doo-young?

05:15.690 --> 05:18.651
You can ask your lawyer. Call him.

05:18.735 --> 05:20.528
I can ask him, but...

05:33.916 --> 05:34.917
Hello, Mr. Han.

05:35.001 --> 05:36.502
DELAYED JUSTICE

05:45.970 --> 05:47.972
Mapo-gu Yeonnam-ro 22, 2nd Floor

05:53.936 --> 05:55.188
Thank you.

05:56.606 --> 05:57.482
Okay.

06:03.529 --> 06:04.822
He was released...

06:07.158 --> 06:08.659
three months ago.

06:12.914 --> 06:14.457
Our laws are so...

06:14.707 --> 06:17.043
Couldn't they let you know first?

06:17.627 --> 06:19.420
It must really be him.

06:21.756 --> 06:23.257
We'll have to be careful.

06:23.925 --> 06:27.637
Let's be careful. Lock the doors.
Don't go anywhere alone.

06:28.096 --> 06:29.847
I'm sure he's bitter towards us, too,

06:30.389 --> 06:32.058
not just to Ye-eun.

06:35.603 --> 06:36.687
Well...

06:40.858 --> 06:44.195
I don't know for sure
if it's related to what's going on, but...

06:47.782 --> 06:49.700
Mapo-gu Yeonnam-ro 22, 2nd Floor

06:50.409 --> 06:51.244
What is it?

06:53.704 --> 06:55.998
I don't know what to say, but...

06:57.166 --> 07:00.002
What's wrong? You're being so serious,
it's scaring me.

07:08.386 --> 07:11.264
-Why did you scream?
-You screamed, so I screamed.

07:11.347 --> 07:13.224
-What?
-It's the doorbell. Calm down.

07:14.058 --> 07:16.144
-Who is it at this hour?
-Are you scared, too?

07:16.727 --> 07:17.562
Of course.

07:18.479 --> 07:21.274
-Who is it?
-Is it him? Is it Doo-young?

07:21.524 --> 07:24.360
-I don't know. I can't see his face.
-You can see the back of his head.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.237
How can I tell from the back of his head?

07:26.320 --> 07:28.906
You were with him for so long.

07:29.157 --> 07:30.783
-What the...
-Eun.

07:30.867 --> 07:32.952
-No. Don't go.
-Don't go.

07:33.035 --> 07:34.704
-Eun.
-Hey.

07:37.331 --> 07:39.292
-What?
-I was wondering if everything was okay.

07:39.500 --> 07:41.085
Why wouldn't it be?

07:41.252 --> 07:43.296
You know, like if there's a leak, or...

07:43.379 --> 07:46.257
-This isn't a greenhouse.
-Or a power outage.

07:48.426 --> 07:49.802
I guess not.

07:49.886 --> 07:52.805
You could have been scared by the thunder.

07:52.889 --> 07:54.056
Have a good night.

07:57.518 --> 07:59.562
How did she know
from the back of his head?

08:00.021 --> 08:02.857
-I know.
-I'm going to wash up first.

08:29.842 --> 08:32.637
Be careful. Call me if anything happens.

08:32.720 --> 08:33.888
Bye.

08:39.060 --> 08:40.686
-Call me.
-Okay.

08:58.621 --> 08:59.705
Jong-yeoul.

09:06.003 --> 09:07.922
I need to talk to you for a minute.

09:16.222 --> 09:18.849
-Are they back together?
-I don't know.

09:29.068 --> 09:30.778
That's the situation,

09:31.404 --> 09:34.740
so if you see Ye-eun's ex-boyfriend,
please let me know.

09:37.159 --> 09:38.160
Okay.

09:39.036 --> 09:39.870
Okay, then.

09:45.418 --> 09:46.502
Eun-jae.

09:53.175 --> 09:54.510
You be careful, too.

10:09.025 --> 10:09.859
Okay.

10:11.027 --> 10:12.320
I'll be careful.

10:18.326 --> 10:19.660
-Hello.
-Hi.

10:19.952 --> 10:21.037
-Hello.
-Hi.

10:22.079 --> 10:23.539
You know hapkido, right?

10:24.498 --> 10:27.835
-And?
-Good. Teach me some self-defense moves.

10:28.419 --> 10:30.880
Even poop is useful as fertilizer.

10:31.589 --> 10:32.882
Are you saying I'm poop?

10:33.007 --> 10:35.217
Something I can use right away.

10:36.677 --> 10:38.512
What did you do this time?

10:51.817 --> 10:53.110
Don't you have anything to say?

10:53.986 --> 10:57.198
-Did you even understand what I said?
-Yes.

10:57.990 --> 11:01.494
Your ex-boyfriend got out of jail
and texted you.

11:03.913 --> 11:04.914
But...

11:07.958 --> 11:09.418
Is he a good fighter?

11:10.127 --> 11:11.837
-Are you scared?
-Yes.

11:12.755 --> 11:14.965
I can't fight. What should we do?

11:15.758 --> 11:17.051
That's all?

11:17.843 --> 11:18.844
What?

11:19.678 --> 11:21.847
Forget it, if you're so scared.

11:25.684 --> 11:27.561
How fast do you run?

11:29.563 --> 11:31.857
I run 100m in 15 seconds.

11:33.609 --> 11:37.321
Then you should run away first.
I run 100m in 17 seconds.

11:37.905 --> 11:39.907
If we see him when we're together,

11:40.074 --> 11:42.743
you run away first
and call the police, okay?

11:45.538 --> 11:48.666
If I were slower than you,
you would run away first?

11:48.958 --> 11:51.627
Yes. I'll get the cops.

11:51.710 --> 11:53.003
I promise.

11:57.466 --> 11:58.426
Seriously.

12:05.558 --> 12:06.434
Try it.

12:07.017 --> 12:08.436
Do what I taught you earlier.

12:10.604 --> 12:13.441
-This is nice.
-Hey!

12:15.943 --> 12:18.112
-Lightly, you punk.
-You said to pretend it's real.

12:18.195 --> 12:19.363
Forget it. Don't bother.

12:19.447 --> 12:22.408
No. I'm in the most danger.

12:22.700 --> 12:25.244
Why? It's your friend who's being stalked.

12:25.327 --> 12:26.662
Don't you watch movies?

12:26.787 --> 12:29.748
The one being stalked doesn't die.
Her friend she's with does.

12:29.832 --> 12:32.209
Her friend who doesn't have a boyfriend.

12:32.543 --> 12:34.920
-It's okay. You won't die.
-Why not?

12:35.004 --> 12:36.755
Because annoying people don't die.

12:38.632 --> 12:39.508
Hey!

12:39.592 --> 12:41.552
Offense is the best defense.

12:41.635 --> 12:44.722
Take two. What if someone
grabs your hair? Try it.

12:44.847 --> 12:46.599
-You didn't teach me this.
-Apply...

12:47.391 --> 12:48.225
Whatever.

12:49.059 --> 12:50.144
Hey.

12:50.728 --> 12:51.896
Hey.

12:51.979 --> 12:53.814
And they say they aren't dating.

12:56.066 --> 12:59.862
Today, we will discuss cognitive therapy.

13:00.362 --> 13:02.448
Cognitive therapy.

13:03.115 --> 13:05.367
The main goal of the cognitive therapy is

13:05.951 --> 13:08.913
to remedy one's distorted thinking.

13:09.413 --> 13:12.791
What we're going to look
into in particular today

13:12.958 --> 13:14.251
is the radical thinking.

13:15.085 --> 13:16.795
The radical thinking here means

13:17.087 --> 13:19.590
viewing everything in black and white

13:19.673 --> 13:22.051
and categorizing all the experiences

13:22.134 --> 13:23.761
into one extreme.

13:24.678 --> 13:25.513
Now...

13:33.103 --> 13:35.731
-Where is Ye-eun?
-Eun-jae!

13:38.526 --> 13:40.402
Eun-jae! Stop right there!

13:47.910 --> 13:49.161
Eun-jae.

13:49.245 --> 13:50.079
Eun-jae!

13:51.789 --> 13:54.124
Eun-jae. Wake up.

14:03.551 --> 14:04.718
No.

14:05.135 --> 14:06.136
Jong-yeoul.

14:07.137 --> 14:08.222
No, Eun-jae.

14:08.722 --> 14:10.849
This isn't right. This is...

14:12.142 --> 14:14.144
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

14:14.728 --> 14:16.814
I was wrong. So...

14:18.315 --> 14:21.485
So, don't die like this. Please, no.

14:21.944 --> 14:23.445
-Eun-jae.
-Jong-yeoul.

14:24.405 --> 14:25.781
Do you know...

14:26.490 --> 14:27.324
that...

14:28.033 --> 14:30.995
I like you, Jong-yeoul?

14:32.371 --> 14:33.706
Eun-jae.

14:40.754 --> 14:41.589
Eun-jae.

14:43.090 --> 14:45.217
Eun-jae.

14:48.220 --> 14:49.305
Eun-jae!

14:54.560 --> 14:56.770
And in many cases, this radical thinking

14:57.479 --> 14:59.732
leads to schizophrenia,

14:59.815 --> 15:03.068
which we will look into in more detail.

15:03.652 --> 15:05.905
What are the common symptoms
of schizophrenia?

15:07.197 --> 15:09.533
"That person's looking at me weird."

15:09.617 --> 15:12.494
Or, "I feel like that person's
mocking me."

15:12.578 --> 15:16.206
The distorted thinking
and cognition like these...

15:26.634 --> 15:28.552
-Eun-jae!
-Where's Ye-eun?

15:37.269 --> 15:38.729
Stop right there.

15:54.870 --> 15:55.788
Jong-yeoul!

15:56.956 --> 15:58.040
Jong-yeoul!

15:58.123 --> 16:00.125
No! Jong-yeoul...

16:05.673 --> 16:06.799
Eun-jae.

16:17.893 --> 16:19.311
I'm glad...

16:19.895 --> 16:21.271
you are not hurt.

16:23.857 --> 16:24.984
Why did you do it?

16:26.110 --> 16:27.027
Why?

16:28.654 --> 16:29.613
I never...

16:31.448 --> 16:33.659
erased you from my heart.

16:34.952 --> 16:36.370
Not for a moment.

16:40.082 --> 16:41.083
I like you...

16:42.209 --> 16:43.085
Eun-jae.

16:50.259 --> 16:52.177
No. Jong-yeoul.

16:53.470 --> 16:54.596
Open your eyes.

16:55.431 --> 16:57.266
I said to open your eyes!

16:57.349 --> 16:58.976
Would that be a hate crime?

17:00.102 --> 17:02.479
It isn't that easy
to make that conclusion.

17:02.855 --> 17:07.443
Therefore, I would like to discuss
what exactly a hate crime is.

17:10.320 --> 17:11.280
You over there.

17:14.616 --> 17:16.118
Did something good happen?

17:16.326 --> 17:17.578
You look very happy.

17:18.120 --> 17:19.872
Okay, with that happy face,

17:20.456 --> 17:24.334
tell me what you think is the difference
between hate and loathe.

17:33.594 --> 17:35.971
-Where are you going?
-Heimdallr's contract...

17:36.055 --> 17:38.390
That's not important right now.

17:39.475 --> 17:41.852
-What are you doing? Call PR!
-Yes, sir.

17:44.938 --> 17:47.858
I am standing outside the agency

17:47.941 --> 17:52.571
of the Fifth Column,
the hottest group right now.

17:52.863 --> 17:56.241
Dong-hoon, the Fifth Column's
lead vocalist, and actress Da-mi So

17:56.325 --> 17:57.951
have been dating for two years.

17:58.077 --> 17:59.286
That's not true!

17:59.369 --> 18:02.122
-It's a lie!
-The fans are outraged.

18:26.772 --> 18:29.024
EXCLUSIVITY TERMINATION

18:29.108 --> 18:31.860
Oh &amp; Park Entertainment terminates
its contract with Jin-gwang Lee.

18:54.883 --> 18:56.760
NAME: JIN-GWANG LEE

19:35.132 --> 19:36.800
EXCLUSIVITY TERMINATION

20:06.288 --> 20:07.789
Nothing has been confirmed.

20:46.078 --> 20:48.538
EXCLUSIVITY TERMINATION

20:48.622 --> 20:49.748
No.

20:50.082 --> 20:51.750
He was released three months ago.

20:51.833 --> 20:54.169
How could he write a letter
last Christmas?

20:56.129 --> 20:58.924
Yes, he could have written
on any random sheet of paper,

20:59.007 --> 21:00.425
or he could be hiding his identity.

21:01.009 --> 21:02.135
So, I'm going to find out.

21:05.597 --> 21:09.059
It isn't dangerous.
I'm just going to go see.

21:10.811 --> 21:13.021
Whatever. Bye. Sign me in.

21:21.488 --> 21:23.115
YE-JI AHN

21:26.952 --> 21:28.287
I got it.

21:28.954 --> 21:31.331
I'm with her now. Happy? Bye.

21:33.375 --> 21:35.419
-Where are you going?
-Why do you care?

21:37.170 --> 21:38.672
Because I'm your bodyguard.

21:40.257 --> 21:42.050
If anything happens to you,

21:42.676 --> 21:44.845
Madam Ye-ji will kill me.

21:49.182 --> 21:50.475
Where are you going?

21:50.892 --> 21:52.644
To meet Ye-eun's ex-boyfriend.

21:53.353 --> 21:54.438
To do what?

21:55.272 --> 21:56.857
To find out if he sent those texts.

21:58.358 --> 21:59.568
You really have no fear.

22:00.444 --> 22:01.903
I thought he was a total psycho.

22:02.237 --> 22:03.864
He even had a knife.

22:06.450 --> 22:10.662
You must think you can take down a guy
just because you're tall.

22:14.958 --> 22:15.876
Get free.

22:21.423 --> 22:24.384
See? Guys are simply stronger
than girls...

22:27.220 --> 22:28.055
Happy?

22:30.307 --> 22:31.308
That's cheating.

22:32.684 --> 22:33.894
She's strong.

22:33.977 --> 22:38.148
RESEARCH SUBJECTS AND BUDGET 2017 REVIEW

22:38.857 --> 22:39.733
Doo-young Ko?

22:40.358 --> 22:42.235
There's no one here by that name.

22:43.236 --> 22:44.071
Doo-young Ko?

22:44.654 --> 22:46.031
Did he come back?

22:46.823 --> 22:48.366
I'm not sure.

22:49.534 --> 22:50.410
Thank you.

22:59.002 --> 23:00.629
NEW MATERIALS ENGINEERING
LABORATORY

23:10.097 --> 23:13.100
-Are you in New Materials Engineering?
-Yes.

23:13.183 --> 23:15.644
Then do you know Doo-young Ko?

23:15.727 --> 23:16.686
He's my year.

23:17.270 --> 23:19.898
He is? He's a friend from high school.

23:20.482 --> 23:22.901
I haven't been able to reach him recently.

23:22.984 --> 23:25.070
We last caught up over a year ago.

23:28.323 --> 23:30.325
I don't think he came back to the school.

23:31.993 --> 23:34.287
Find out who his closest friend is.

23:34.913 --> 23:36.289
He may have contacted him.

23:37.082 --> 23:37.916
Should we?

23:39.459 --> 23:42.379
Why do I feel like I'm the only one
who's busy? What do you think?

23:43.130 --> 23:44.923
It's all in your head.
Don't think about it.

24:08.947 --> 24:10.448
This is it. This is my home.

24:13.118 --> 24:13.994
Thank you.

24:16.830 --> 24:18.123
Get home safely.

24:18.331 --> 24:19.916
-Wait.
-Yes?

24:23.378 --> 24:25.547
May I come in for a minute?

24:27.883 --> 24:31.428
Hey. Guys aren't allowed in our house.

24:32.220 --> 24:33.221
I see.

24:34.181 --> 24:35.724
But I really need to pee.

24:37.601 --> 24:39.686
Is there a bathroom there?

24:40.937 --> 24:42.898
-Yes.
-Good. Bye.

24:43.732 --> 24:44.733
Gosh!

24:53.408 --> 24:54.409
This must be it.

25:20.435 --> 25:22.270
-Is this it?
-Yes.

25:24.189 --> 25:25.941
It gives me chills being back here.

25:27.025 --> 25:28.109
Should we turn back?

25:28.818 --> 25:30.153
After coming all the way here?

25:30.987 --> 25:31.988
Are you stupid?

25:44.167 --> 25:46.044
Doo-young still lives here.

25:46.920 --> 25:48.255
Let's go up.

25:48.421 --> 25:50.423
-Unit 904?
-Yes. At the end of the hall.

25:50.507 --> 25:53.593
-Stay here. I'll go check.
-What?

25:54.177 --> 25:56.680
Don't do anything,
and stay here until I get back.

25:57.889 --> 26:00.016
I wouldn't do that to a friend.

26:13.613 --> 26:14.823
Someone must live here.

26:15.365 --> 26:16.866
There is nothing by the door.

26:18.285 --> 26:20.120
The maintenance workers cleaned it.

26:20.203 --> 26:21.705
They do that in Seoul?

26:22.622 --> 26:24.416
-Ring the bell.
-Me?

26:24.916 --> 26:27.669
Isn't it better for a girl to do it?

26:30.255 --> 26:31.256
Me?

26:31.673 --> 26:32.716
Aren't you a girl?

26:34.801 --> 26:37.554
Take off the cap. Hair behind your ears.

26:38.346 --> 26:40.140
-Okay.
-Stop it.

26:40.348 --> 26:41.516
Use your looks.

26:46.521 --> 26:47.439
That's better.

26:48.023 --> 26:49.774
Do you have lipstick?

26:51.651 --> 26:55.030
-No.
-Okay. Give me a pretty look.

26:57.741 --> 26:59.784
-Forget it.
-It's not for me.

27:01.494 --> 27:02.829
Show me a pretty look. Come on.

27:12.797 --> 27:15.759
-I won't do it.
-Hey, no. You look super pretty.

27:16.259 --> 27:17.469
Ring the bell.

27:17.844 --> 27:18.678
Go on.

27:19.637 --> 27:20.930
Look pretty. Okay?

27:22.932 --> 27:24.184
That's good.

27:37.364 --> 27:38.239
He must be out.

27:39.991 --> 27:41.117
That's strange.

27:55.632 --> 27:56.925
-End of the hall?
-A guy

27:57.008 --> 27:58.051
-got off the elevator,
-Why?

27:58.134 --> 28:00.011
-and hid.
-There are two guys there.

28:00.178 --> 28:01.304
One tall and one short.

28:01.388 --> 28:02.680
Really?

28:04.057 --> 28:05.350
You said he would recognize you.

28:05.934 --> 28:07.560
-Is it Doo-young?
-Is he tall?

28:07.685 --> 28:09.104
He wouldn't have hidden otherwise.

28:09.187 --> 28:11.314
No. He's average.

28:12.232 --> 28:14.359
Stay here. I'll check.

28:14.442 --> 28:15.819
What does he look like?

28:15.902 --> 28:17.112
He looks like...

28:17.987 --> 28:20.657
He has a pretty face, and curly hair.

28:20.740 --> 28:21.699
What should we do?

28:23.410 --> 28:25.703
-I'll go.
-And do what?

28:27.747 --> 28:29.290
-Look pretty?
-Forget it.

28:30.250 --> 28:33.878
That doesn't work for you
unless they look closely.

28:34.170 --> 28:35.004
Stay here.

28:36.714 --> 28:37.632
Sung-min.

28:39.092 --> 28:41.428
Be careful. You know, right?

28:42.011 --> 28:43.596
If anything happens to you,

28:46.057 --> 28:47.976
I have to take the bus home.

28:50.854 --> 28:52.063
Be careful.

29:37.817 --> 29:38.943
Hey.

29:40.653 --> 29:44.324
-Ji-won.
-Don't come. He might have a knife. Run!

29:44.407 --> 29:46.826
I said to stay there. Hurry up, run!

29:46.910 --> 29:47.786
Don't worry...

29:47.869 --> 29:49.579
I'm not worried about you.

29:50.371 --> 29:51.289
But, stop.

29:51.372 --> 29:52.749
He's on our side.

29:57.545 --> 29:58.922
Separate.

29:59.839 --> 30:01.090
Who are you?

30:02.008 --> 30:03.092
Our side?

30:08.473 --> 30:09.933
Dang it.

30:11.559 --> 30:13.061
Of all the...

30:26.825 --> 30:28.701
He didn't go to his school either?

30:29.661 --> 30:31.913
No. No one saw him.

30:33.039 --> 30:35.041
His apartment is still in his name.

30:55.144 --> 30:57.480
No need to get out. Go home. Thank you!

30:57.689 --> 30:58.815
Thank you.

31:03.319 --> 31:05.196
You must have sprained your back.

31:05.363 --> 31:07.365
Ice packs are best for that.

31:11.160 --> 31:15.248
Your nosebleed looked bad.
I was worried you would bleed to death.

31:15.832 --> 31:18.334
It has stopped. See? Is your neck okay?

31:18.418 --> 31:20.837
I thought I was going to break it
with my headlock.

31:20.920 --> 31:23.464
Not at all.
Look, I can move it fine, right?

31:23.548 --> 31:25.258
-Shall we test it out?
-Want another round?

31:25.383 --> 31:27.594
You go home! And you, come in!

31:32.348 --> 31:34.642
Drive safely. It was a good fight.

31:39.981 --> 31:41.774
Oh, my gosh! Look!

31:42.817 --> 31:43.818
Look!

31:46.404 --> 31:48.364
I knew it!

31:49.866 --> 31:51.993
Dong-hoon Says,
"Da-mi and I are Just Friends."

31:52.702 --> 31:54.829
Finally, it's over.

31:54.913 --> 31:56.998
Dong-hoon Says,
"Da-mi and I are Just Friends."

31:57.081 --> 32:00.835
What's the big deal about dating
in this day and age?

32:01.544 --> 32:05.381
Let's go home, everyone. Good job.

32:05.465 --> 32:06.966
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

32:07.050 --> 32:08.301
I'm leaving.

32:08.384 --> 32:09.719
Good night.

32:09.802 --> 32:11.012
-Good night.
-Good night.

32:15.767 --> 32:19.646
I guess it was a lie that there was
a photo of them leaving a hotel.

32:19.729 --> 32:22.065
Why do you think it took a whole day
to deny they're dating?

32:22.774 --> 32:24.859
-I'm going to go, too.
-Good night.

32:25.234 --> 32:26.527
-See you tomorrow.
-Okay.

32:33.785 --> 32:35.161
They made a deal.

32:35.662 --> 32:37.413
The photos for another exclusive.

32:38.498 --> 32:41.668
Or maybe a part
in the Fifth Column's world tour.

32:44.087 --> 32:45.421
Good job. See you tomorrow.

32:45.505 --> 32:46.339
Bye.

33:11.072 --> 33:13.741
EXCLUSIVITY TERMINATION

33:52.447 --> 33:53.281
Eun-jae.

33:55.199 --> 33:56.325
You be careful, too.

34:19.640 --> 34:21.059
You look pretty.

34:42.288 --> 34:43.539
Why are you so happy?

34:46.584 --> 34:48.920
-Is everyone okay?
-You're home!

34:49.462 --> 34:51.547
Come here. Everyone gather around.

34:59.013 --> 35:01.682
I went to Doo-young's apartment today.

35:03.810 --> 35:05.478
It's still in his name.

35:06.729 --> 35:10.191
General Cho went to his school,
and he didn't go back.

35:10.608 --> 35:12.443
You went to his school?

35:14.612 --> 35:17.031
Well, I was kind of bored, so...

35:20.493 --> 35:23.287
Ye-eun, I saw you coming home
with a guy earlier.

35:24.247 --> 35:25.331
Be careful.

35:27.375 --> 35:30.044
What if he gets more pissed off
that you have a new boyfriend?

35:31.504 --> 35:33.381
You have a boyfriend?

35:33.840 --> 35:34.841
Who?

35:34.966 --> 35:36.300
Ho-chang?

35:37.051 --> 35:39.095
We are not dating yet.

35:40.680 --> 35:42.014
I hate my life.

35:42.682 --> 35:45.268
Some girl stumbles upon an IT genius.

35:45.351 --> 35:46.811
He's not a genius.

35:46.936 --> 35:50.398
They say if an unlucky girl falls in
men's baths, she ends up next to a eunuch.

35:51.816 --> 35:52.942
Madame Jung.

35:53.025 --> 35:57.155
-Will you marry that IT genius?
-There you go again.

35:57.363 --> 35:59.574
Madame Jung. Do you want more tea?

35:59.824 --> 36:00.992
Want more bread?

36:02.660 --> 36:05.329
Whoever you date,
you should know enough about him.

36:05.621 --> 36:07.039
Don't date just anyone.

36:07.748 --> 36:09.625
Hey. I don't just date anyone.

36:10.459 --> 36:13.754
You said last time that he was weird.

36:13.963 --> 36:14.964
I did?

36:15.214 --> 36:18.301
You said he talked weird and looked weird.

36:19.468 --> 36:21.387
I didn't say he looked weird.

36:30.354 --> 36:31.480
It's my lawyer.

36:37.153 --> 36:38.529
Hello, Mr. Han.

36:38.613 --> 36:39.822
Yes.

36:41.157 --> 36:44.660
No. Nothing yet. Yes.

36:45.995 --> 36:46.996
Pardon?

36:50.291 --> 36:51.209
I see.

36:53.920 --> 36:55.296
I understand.

36:56.255 --> 36:58.007
Thank you. Bye.

37:01.385 --> 37:03.221
It isn't Doo-young.

37:04.013 --> 37:06.933
He moved to Canada
right after he was released.

37:07.558 --> 37:08.643
Mr. Han confirmed.

37:17.818 --> 37:20.655
If it isn't Doo-young,
who else could it be?

37:23.241 --> 37:24.533
Can you think of anyone?

37:26.702 --> 37:30.164
How could you not know? Think hard.

37:30.665 --> 37:32.291
Why do you keep talking like that?

37:33.542 --> 37:34.752
What did I do?

37:34.835 --> 37:38.923
You think this is happening to me
because I date random guys.

37:39.924 --> 37:42.093
I do not. Why do you think that?

37:42.176 --> 37:45.221
-You're talking like that.
-I did not.

37:45.805 --> 37:47.974
What do you mean,
who else, other than Doo-young?

37:48.307 --> 37:52.270
You mean I'm a horrible person,
so lots of people hate me.

37:52.645 --> 37:54.522
Why are you twisting my words?

37:55.064 --> 37:56.732
I was just worried.

37:57.358 --> 38:00.361
And how could you not know
when someone hates you that much?

38:00.444 --> 38:02.196
I don't know! I don't!

38:02.446 --> 38:04.448
I'm a terrible person,
so everyone hates me.

38:04.532 --> 38:06.325
That's why I don't know who it is. Happy?

38:08.035 --> 38:09.954
Madame Jung, what's wrong with you?

38:10.037 --> 38:12.123
Eun-jae was just worried.

38:12.915 --> 38:14.500
Why is she blaming me?

38:14.834 --> 38:17.795
To be honest, whose fault is it
that we have to suffer like this?

38:18.629 --> 38:22.008
We can't go anywhere as we please
or open the window in the summer.

38:22.091 --> 38:23.718
She made everyone else uncomfortable,

38:23.801 --> 38:25.845
but she gets a boyfriend
like everything's fine.

38:25.928 --> 38:27.013
Eun-jae.

38:28.514 --> 38:29.682
That's enough.

38:47.616 --> 38:48.617
What?

38:49.243 --> 38:50.077
Sorry?

38:51.912 --> 38:52.747
Nothing.

39:03.341 --> 39:04.383
They fought?

39:04.884 --> 39:07.845
Yes. They were screaming.
I have never seen that before.

39:09.555 --> 39:11.349
You said they were always happy.

39:11.974 --> 39:13.392
That must have been fun.

39:14.185 --> 39:15.394
You find this fun?

39:15.478 --> 39:17.355
It is, as long as it isn't me.

39:19.732 --> 39:21.984
So? If it isn't Doo-young, who is it?

39:22.651 --> 39:25.154
I didn't think it was him to begin with.

39:26.489 --> 39:27.907
Eun-jae is right.

39:28.908 --> 39:29.742
What?

39:30.117 --> 39:31.160
Ye-eun.

39:31.744 --> 39:35.081
What has she been doing,
that so many people hate her?

39:35.456 --> 39:39.335
Hey. That's not right.
She was traumatized.

39:40.336 --> 39:41.170
Traumatized?

39:41.420 --> 39:43.172
From a little photo with scribbles on it?

39:43.381 --> 39:45.424
Because of the text saying she's a bitch?

39:45.841 --> 39:46.842
Goodness.

39:47.051 --> 39:50.096
If there was a snake in her locker,
she would have died.

39:51.097 --> 39:52.264
There was a snake?

39:52.973 --> 39:53.891
A rubber snake.

39:54.934 --> 39:57.436
Anyway, move out soon.

39:57.770 --> 39:59.480
What if you get hurt, too?

40:00.314 --> 40:02.400
What? It has nothing to do with me.

40:02.775 --> 40:06.654
Hey, it's a psycho doing psycho things.
There is no logic to it.

40:07.113 --> 40:10.157
What if the person sets fire to the house?
You'll burn to death too.

40:10.699 --> 40:14.870
Don't stay with someone that people hate.
You'll get stabbed along with her.

40:18.207 --> 40:20.167
That's right. People hate me, too.

40:20.501 --> 40:21.710
When are you moving out?

40:22.545 --> 40:24.296
Soon after I tell them about the letter.

40:24.797 --> 40:25.881
Do it soon.

40:34.098 --> 40:35.307
That's what she meant.

40:36.058 --> 40:38.477
It's like saying I got hit
because I deserved it.

40:40.312 --> 40:43.899
That means
wives who get beaten deserve it, too.

40:44.733 --> 40:45.860
Yes.

40:46.902 --> 40:48.988
I'm so upset as it is.

40:49.864 --> 40:52.116
She says there are lots of people
who hate me,

40:52.241 --> 40:53.868
and that I date just anyone.

40:54.452 --> 40:55.828
I'm so upset.

40:56.954 --> 40:57.788
Yes.

40:58.539 --> 40:59.498
I know.

40:59.874 --> 41:02.626
I know it's hard for them because of me.

41:02.751 --> 41:06.088
Every time I see the scar
on her hand, I feel terrible.

41:06.881 --> 41:12.011
But my feeling bad is one thing.
She shouldn't say that to me.

41:12.386 --> 41:14.847
-Yes.
-Is that all you can say?

41:15.431 --> 41:16.682
All you say is "Yes."

41:17.308 --> 41:19.768
Just give me a robot that says, "Yes."

41:20.352 --> 41:21.187
Yes.

41:22.313 --> 41:23.314
I mean...

41:33.532 --> 41:35.743
Maybe you were wrong about me.

41:37.453 --> 41:38.454
What?

41:39.163 --> 41:41.665
I may not be a nice person.

41:43.834 --> 41:44.960
You are a nice person.

41:47.796 --> 41:50.216
A nice and pretty person.

41:51.759 --> 41:53.844
Then why do people hate me?

41:55.262 --> 41:57.139
It's because of their popularity.

41:58.432 --> 42:00.851
People post mean comments
because they're popular.

42:02.811 --> 42:04.313
This is a bit much though.

42:04.939 --> 42:08.275
It's not like they killed their parents.
Why do they hate them so much?

42:09.151 --> 42:10.236
Are you reporting them?

42:10.319 --> 42:12.655
Just send what we captured

42:12.780 --> 42:14.823
-to the legal team by email.
-Okay.

42:16.033 --> 42:17.576
I'm so upset.

42:18.202 --> 42:20.329
How do the kids read
all of these every day?

42:20.538 --> 42:23.374
It's okay to ignore them,
but they read them all anyway.

42:24.250 --> 42:26.919
That's why they get depressed
and develop panic disorders.

42:28.254 --> 42:29.296
Why do they do it?

42:30.130 --> 42:31.215
I'll go now.

42:32.383 --> 42:34.051
-Heimdallr?
-Yes.

42:37.513 --> 42:38.389
Then again,

42:39.056 --> 42:42.685
from Asgard's point of view,
they must envy this, too.

42:44.979 --> 42:46.105
I'll be back in a bit.

43:06.750 --> 43:10.588
Oh &amp; Park must repent! It's been 5 years,
yet they terminate the 7-year contract!

43:27.855 --> 43:28.731
What are you doing?

43:29.356 --> 43:30.357
Can't you tell?

43:31.025 --> 43:32.026
You said you'll sign it.

43:33.611 --> 43:36.488
When did I say that?
I said I would think it over.

43:37.364 --> 43:39.491
If you wanted something,
you should have said so first.

43:39.700 --> 43:40.868
You can't do this.

43:42.077 --> 43:45.623
Did the agency tell us in advance
that they were firing us? Whatever.

43:50.461 --> 43:52.421
You didn't say anything either.

44:02.931 --> 44:03.807
Hello?

44:05.726 --> 44:06.810
Okay, I'm coming.

44:18.530 --> 44:20.074
Yes, I'm checking.

44:21.116 --> 44:23.452
I'll figure it out and report shortly.

44:26.622 --> 44:27.498
Jin-myung.

44:37.841 --> 44:39.051
Let's talk later.

44:48.060 --> 44:49.687
Maybe it's all over online.

44:53.315 --> 44:55.692
Oh &amp; Park one-man protest

45:08.080 --> 45:09.456
Try to get free.

45:09.540 --> 45:12.960
Try to get free. The moves
you taught me were useless, right?

45:13.043 --> 45:16.296
-Try to get free.
-Seriously, you little...

45:16.422 --> 45:19.299
Hey. There's just so much patience
a person can have.

45:19.383 --> 45:21.260
-Try to get free. Can you do it?
-That hurts.

45:21.343 --> 45:22.553
Try to get free.

45:26.306 --> 45:30.102
Violence has no place in society.
No violence! Violence go away!

45:33.439 --> 45:34.314
Hi.

45:34.815 --> 45:36.108
Can we talk?

45:36.900 --> 45:37.776
What?

45:43.073 --> 45:45.451
Hey. Don't say anything stupid.

45:51.665 --> 45:53.250
Why are you limping?

45:59.715 --> 46:00.549
What's up?

46:01.341 --> 46:02.634
We need to talk about Ye-eun.

46:04.470 --> 46:06.513
Is it true that Doo-young isn't in Korea?

46:07.306 --> 46:09.183
Yes. The lawyer confirmed.

46:10.184 --> 46:12.102
Is there anyone else that you suspect?

46:14.021 --> 46:15.939
No. Not yet.

46:18.859 --> 46:20.444
What does Ye-eun plan to do?

46:20.819 --> 46:22.488
Will she call the police?

46:22.738 --> 46:24.698
I don't think she wants to.

46:24.781 --> 46:26.825
She has to discuss it
with her parents, too.

46:31.580 --> 46:34.833
Why are you asking me
instead of asking her directly?

46:35.167 --> 46:36.251
I have my reasons.

46:37.836 --> 46:40.005
Anyway, I got it. Thank you.

46:47.846 --> 46:49.640
I'm going home.

46:50.182 --> 46:51.225
Good night.

47:04.071 --> 47:05.280
Jin-myung.

47:07.741 --> 47:12.079
It's a skill to know
what you can and cannot do.

47:14.206 --> 47:17.626
I'll finish up the Asgard matter,
just so you know.

47:18.335 --> 47:19.586
Yes, sir.

47:49.032 --> 47:50.826
Oh &amp; Park must repent!

48:36.496 --> 48:38.040
-Eun.
-Yes?

48:38.665 --> 48:39.666
The water is boiling.

48:41.960 --> 48:43.337
Why can't she do it?

48:45.130 --> 48:47.466
Ye-eun! The water's boiling.

48:48.759 --> 48:49.885
Turn it off for me!

49:14.701 --> 49:16.662
Why did she boil water
if she'd brush her teeth?

49:16.745 --> 49:17.954
What a waste of electricity.

49:19.706 --> 49:23.710
If you care so much about that,
why did you leave home with the lights on?

49:24.711 --> 49:27.839
People who leave the water running
while brushing their teeth are so weird.

49:27.923 --> 49:30.175
Why would you waste water like that?

49:30.258 --> 49:31.093
Am I wrong?

49:32.094 --> 49:36.473
You're so right.
You don't wash much to not waste water.

49:36.640 --> 49:38.975
The Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries
should award you.

49:39.810 --> 49:42.604
The Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries?
Why are you mentioning them?

49:42.688 --> 49:44.439
You mean the EPA.

49:45.524 --> 49:46.858
You're so smart.

49:47.859 --> 49:49.653
Better than being ignorant.

49:52.406 --> 49:53.573
Hi.

49:54.157 --> 49:55.492
Ji-won!

49:56.910 --> 49:58.286
Why are you home so late?

50:00.247 --> 50:01.790
It isn't even 9:00 p.m.

50:02.124 --> 50:03.834
Come home early.

50:04.418 --> 50:05.836
At least for the time being.

50:10.048 --> 50:12.426
Because of them? They'll get over it.

50:14.010 --> 50:15.053
Hi, Jin-myung.

50:50.213 --> 50:52.257
Mapo-gu Yeonnam-ro 22, 2nd Floor

51:01.725 --> 51:02.893
I need to talk to all of you.

51:09.858 --> 51:11.651
Ye-eun, can you come out?

51:11.860 --> 51:12.694
Why?

51:14.863 --> 51:16.573
Eun-jae, come out.

51:40.180 --> 51:43.058
I have been meaning to tell you
for the past few days.

51:48.605 --> 51:51.358
You asked why I moved in here, right?

51:54.528 --> 51:56.655
The truth is, this...

52:13.463 --> 52:14.673
Mom.

52:16.049 --> 52:17.676
Pack your things. You're moving home.

52:18.260 --> 52:19.553
-Hello.
-Hello.

52:23.348 --> 52:24.182
Mom.

52:24.641 --> 52:27.811
-Why? What's going on?
-I heard from Mr. Han.

52:28.144 --> 52:30.146
Some strange guy is bothering you again.

52:30.313 --> 52:32.941
How have you been behaving,
that this happened again?

52:33.400 --> 52:36.069
I said if it happens again,
you're moving back home.

52:36.862 --> 52:37.988
Where is your room?

52:46.538 --> 52:48.331
Get moving. I said to pack your things.

52:49.457 --> 52:50.625
Mom.

52:51.793 --> 52:53.795
We told you to study.

52:53.962 --> 52:56.840
All you do is dating.
That's why this happens.

52:57.257 --> 52:59.885
Other kids aren't like this.
What's wrong with you?

53:00.677 --> 53:03.555
Look at your aunt's daughters.
This never happens.

53:03.847 --> 53:07.601
Do you know how hard it was
to make sure no one found out?

53:08.560 --> 53:11.146
How could you humiliate
our family like this?

53:11.396 --> 53:13.773
Where did you pick that up?
How scandalous.

53:14.816 --> 53:17.277
Don't complain. Pack your things,
and move back home.

53:17.777 --> 53:19.237
Mom, don't do this.

53:19.863 --> 53:21.489
What about school?

53:21.656 --> 53:25.160
-Who cares about school?
-What did I do wrong?

53:25.702 --> 53:27.871
I heard you got a boyfriend again.

53:28.204 --> 53:30.916
Why are you so boy-crazy?

53:31.708 --> 53:33.376
Seriously.

53:33.460 --> 53:35.587
You're not even married,
but you go to a guy's house.

53:36.129 --> 53:38.798
It's because of the way you act,
that these things happen to you.

53:39.466 --> 53:43.094
And how long has it been,
that you're dating someone else already?

53:45.555 --> 53:48.808
What if word gets out?
How can I face people?

53:54.064 --> 53:57.150
Pack everything and come out.
I'll wait in the car.

53:57.484 --> 54:00.528
Don't leave anything behind.
I don't want to come back again.

54:10.413 --> 54:11.247
Madame Jung.

54:12.624 --> 54:13.625
I'm sorry.

54:14.960 --> 54:16.962
My mom is just angry.

54:18.213 --> 54:19.881
She isn't usually like this.

54:21.883 --> 54:23.134
Are you leaving?

54:24.970 --> 54:27.222
I think I'll have to for now,

54:28.598 --> 54:30.100
even if I come back later.

54:36.064 --> 54:38.400
Help me with my things.

55:55.310 --> 55:56.728
I'll call.

55:57.312 --> 55:58.521
Okay.

56:09.949 --> 56:11.159
Take care.

56:15.038 --> 56:15.997
It was...

56:17.999 --> 56:19.834
uncomfortable because of me, wasn't it?

56:21.419 --> 56:24.005
Yes, it was uncomfortable.

56:26.049 --> 56:27.133
I'm sorry.

56:30.845 --> 56:32.013
Take care.

56:32.097 --> 56:32.972
No.

56:35.183 --> 56:36.142
Don't go.

56:38.603 --> 56:39.979
Why won't you fight back?

56:40.313 --> 56:42.190
You always say what you think.

56:42.774 --> 56:44.609
You argue well.

56:44.818 --> 56:47.403
You're good at saying mean things
to other people.

56:47.946 --> 56:49.322
Why won't you say anything now?

56:50.406 --> 56:51.866
Your mom is wrong.

56:52.617 --> 56:54.953
A mom shouldn't say things like that.

56:55.620 --> 56:58.289
What did you do wrong
that you have to hear that?

56:59.541 --> 57:00.708
You're the victim.

57:01.876 --> 57:03.378
Why is she blaming you?

57:06.506 --> 57:07.924
Tell her to apologize.

57:08.633 --> 57:10.760
Tell your mom to apologize.

57:11.678 --> 57:13.555
Why do you put up with it like a fool?

57:17.517 --> 57:18.601
What was that?

57:20.019 --> 57:23.606
What did you do wrong?
You did nothing wrong.

57:23.857 --> 57:25.984
Why is she saying things like that
and hurting you?

57:26.067 --> 57:29.279
Look. If you have something to say,
say it to me.

57:35.326 --> 57:36.536
Get in!

57:42.709 --> 57:43.710
Eun-jae.

57:51.634 --> 57:53.470
I don't think you should go either.

57:58.057 --> 57:59.142
Jin-myung.

58:01.102 --> 58:02.937
What are you doing?

58:03.104 --> 58:06.357
Who are you kids?
Will you kids take responsibility?

58:07.192 --> 58:08.026
No.

58:08.610 --> 58:09.736
Why should I?

58:10.862 --> 58:12.739
How can we be responsible
for someone else?

58:14.365 --> 58:15.909
No one can do that.

58:16.659 --> 58:18.578
The same goes for you.

58:20.038 --> 58:21.789
Ye-eun will be responsible for herself.

58:22.373 --> 58:23.750
That's the only way.

58:24.792 --> 58:26.002
So...

58:27.337 --> 58:28.671
you decide.

58:51.653 --> 58:53.655
What are you doing? Get in!

59:08.044 --> 59:09.087
I'm dead.

59:09.963 --> 59:11.756
My mom is really scary.

59:12.840 --> 59:15.677
Even still.
Every parent loses to their child.

59:16.636 --> 59:18.137
Not my mom.

59:18.304 --> 59:19.764
Do you want to go, then?

59:21.683 --> 59:23.309
My legs feel weak.

59:24.102 --> 59:26.938
You started strong.
Why are you scared now? Get up.

59:32.443 --> 59:35.905
I was too scared to notice earlier,
but Eun-jae was so funny.

59:36.656 --> 59:39.367
She was looking at Ye-eun
but talking to her mom.

59:40.493 --> 59:42.120
-I was scared.
-"Tell her to apologize."

59:42.453 --> 59:43.454
That was funny.

59:53.006 --> 59:55.425
It's late. Let's unpack tomorrow.

59:55.508 --> 59:57.010
-Okay.
-Good night.

59:57.677 --> 59:58.970
-Night.
-Good night.

59:59.053 --> 1:00:01.431
-Good night.
-Good night.

1:00:07.395 --> 1:00:09.022
Mapo-gu Yeonnam-ro 22, 2nd Floor

1:00:25.330 --> 1:00:26.289
Are you sleeping?

1:00:28.916 --> 1:00:30.376
Are you sleeping?

1:00:32.045 --> 1:00:32.879
Yes.

1:00:33.671 --> 1:00:34.589
Why?

1:00:35.715 --> 1:00:37.508
I wondered if you were sleeping.

1:00:39.510 --> 1:00:41.804
I barely fell asleep.

1:00:44.515 --> 1:00:45.391
Am I...

1:00:46.809 --> 1:00:48.645
really the hateful type?

1:00:50.104 --> 1:00:50.938
What?

1:00:52.315 --> 1:00:53.941
That's what Eun-jae said.

1:00:55.276 --> 1:00:57.528
That I'm good at saying mean things.

1:00:59.864 --> 1:01:02.450
She also said you say what you think.

1:01:03.117 --> 1:01:05.328
And that you're smart too, I believe.

1:01:06.245 --> 1:01:07.330
Did she?

1:01:10.667 --> 1:01:14.253
Do you also think I'm hateful?

1:01:16.839 --> 1:01:20.426
-Is that what you care about right now?
-Yes.

1:01:21.928 --> 1:01:23.971
Yes, you're hateful.

1:01:57.380 --> 1:01:58.381
Who is it?

1:01:58.673 --> 1:01:59.507
Hello?

1:02:00.174 --> 1:02:01.718
Is Eun Cho...

1:02:24.365 --> 1:02:25.783
Why are you here?

1:02:26.451 --> 1:02:27.827
You wouldn't take my calls.

1:02:28.911 --> 1:02:30.913
Hyun, come here. Come here.

1:02:32.999 --> 1:02:36.085
This is Hyun. Hyun Cho.
She has a short name like you.

1:02:36.669 --> 1:02:37.837
Say hi to your sister.

1:02:38.296 --> 1:02:39.338
Hi.

1:02:40.465 --> 1:02:43.176
-If she's a girl, why is her hair short?
-So?

1:02:49.849 --> 1:02:51.809
She starts school next year.

1:02:51.976 --> 1:02:52.894
So?

1:03:00.526 --> 1:03:03.112
Convince your mom for me.

1:03:06.282 --> 1:03:07.325
Why should I?

1:03:10.369 --> 1:03:12.747
Dad.

1:03:12.830 --> 1:03:16.209
No. It's okay. It's nothing.

1:03:19.921 --> 1:03:22.256
Fine. I will do that.

1:03:24.091 --> 1:03:26.469
But answer my question first.

1:03:28.554 --> 1:03:30.807
If you find someone
you like more someday...

1:03:32.725 --> 1:03:34.685
will you abandon everyone again?

1:03:37.355 --> 1:03:40.566
Will you abandon her and her mom?

1:03:43.528 --> 1:03:45.071
Don't fight, Dad.

1:03:45.154 --> 1:03:47.949
No. We're not fighting. We're talking.

1:03:48.032 --> 1:03:49.450
Tell me.

1:03:50.284 --> 1:03:51.953
If you find someone you like more,

1:03:54.872 --> 1:03:56.874
will you abandon them as well?

1:04:05.258 --> 1:04:06.300
I'm sorry.

1:04:12.431 --> 1:04:13.766
Let's go.

1:05:00.688 --> 1:05:01.898
You're in my way.

1:05:04.442 --> 1:05:06.402
Why am I like this?

1:05:08.279 --> 1:05:10.156
There are times when I hate myself.

1:05:12.617 --> 1:05:13.951
I hate myself, too.

1:05:15.036 --> 1:05:18.789
So, I can't ask other people to like me.

1:05:21.167 --> 1:05:23.127
Either be mean through and through...

1:05:23.836 --> 1:05:25.379
But I'm only somewhat mean.

1:05:26.756 --> 1:05:29.508
I'm somewhat mean, somewhat regretful,

1:05:30.176 --> 1:05:31.469
and somewhat hopeful.

1:05:33.596 --> 1:05:34.972
What has gotten into you?

1:05:37.183 --> 1:05:39.894
It would have been nice
if I were simple and honest.

1:05:42.104 --> 1:05:43.105
Perhaps,

1:05:43.856 --> 1:05:45.816
there is someone
who would like me as I am.

1:05:50.363 --> 1:05:53.532
There is no point. He'll laugh at me.

1:05:56.494 --> 1:05:57.828
It's better to be lonely,

1:05:58.412 --> 1:05:59.455
than to be teased.

1:06:01.123 --> 1:06:02.541
If I don't like anyone,

1:06:03.167 --> 1:06:04.627
I won't get hurt.

1:06:05.461 --> 1:06:06.796
If I don't want anything,

1:06:07.755 --> 1:06:09.256
I won't be sad.

1:06:16.472 --> 1:06:19.558
Don't bother having hope.
Don't want anything.

1:06:20.226 --> 1:06:21.894
Close doors upon doors.

1:06:23.562 --> 1:06:26.232
Eun. This is yours, right?

1:06:34.490 --> 1:06:37.827
If I pretend not to know,
things can go back to normal.

1:06:38.911 --> 1:06:42.123
If I take no interest in them,
they'll take no interest in me.

1:06:43.541 --> 1:06:44.625
Just ignore it.

1:06:46.210 --> 1:06:47.712
It's because of this.

1:06:51.757 --> 1:06:55.344
I'll make you pay what you did, you bitch.
I won't forgive you. I'll have my revenge.

1:06:57.596 --> 1:06:59.140
The reason I moved in here...

1:07:00.891 --> 1:07:02.435
was this letter.

1:07:15.364 --> 1:07:20.161
I'll make you pay what you did, you bitch.
I won't forgive you. I'll have my revenge.

1:07:38.554 --> 1:07:40.431
Whose life did I ruin?

1:07:40.598 --> 1:07:43.059
Ye-eun! Why are you all down?

1:07:43.142 --> 1:07:45.728
Where does she live?
I'll yank out all of her hair.

1:07:45.811 --> 1:07:48.230
I will definitely find the sender.

1:07:48.314 --> 1:07:50.399
Do you have a record
of the person who sold this book?

1:07:50.483 --> 1:07:52.943
-Here it is. Young-soo Kim.
-Who would that be?

1:07:53.027 --> 1:07:55.196
I think it was meant for someone else.

1:07:55.279 --> 1:07:57.114
Are you sure this was for you?

1:07:57.198 --> 1:08:00.367
-It could have been for another housemate.
-It may be me.

1:08:00.451 --> 1:08:01.911
Do you have any idea

1:08:01.994 --> 1:08:04.121
what it's like to give your everything
for something?

1:08:04.205 --> 1:08:06.082
You're a leftover among leftovers.

1:08:06.165 --> 1:08:07.541
Do you even...

1:08:08.501 --> 1:08:12.838
Maybe that pink letter was for me.

1:08:20.179 --> 1:08:22.014
-Hello.
-Hello.

1:08:34.735 --> 1:08:36.112
Is it for someone else?

1:08:36.612 --> 1:08:38.155
No, it's for me.

1:08:38.239 --> 1:08:40.616
This section is for children.

1:08:41.158 --> 1:08:42.243
Junior.

1:08:46.705 --> 1:08:47.748
Hello.

1:09:00.719 --> 1:09:02.138
-Excuse me.
-Is it for a gift?

1:09:02.721 --> 1:09:04.598
No. It's for me.

1:09:08.644 --> 1:09:10.646
-Hello.
-Hello.

1:09:17.736 --> 1:09:18.904
I'll take this.

1:09:20.698 --> 1:09:21.907
Is it a gift?

1:09:22.408 --> 1:09:24.410
No. It's for me.

1:09:25.619 --> 1:09:27.371
But the size...

1:09:27.788 --> 1:09:29.039
It's 75D.

1:09:30.541 --> 1:09:32.543
-I mean it.
-Shall we measure you?

1:09:38.424 --> 1:09:40.134
-Hello.
-Hello.

1:09:48.767 --> 1:09:50.019
There it is.

1:09:56.817 --> 1:09:57.735
Isn't this pretty?

1:10:00.321 --> 1:10:01.405
Yes.

1:10:01.739 --> 1:10:03.157
Open your eyes.

1:10:10.456 --> 1:10:11.540
I want to go outside.

1:10:12.458 --> 1:10:13.500
Hello.

1:10:14.919 --> 1:10:16.295
May I help you?

1:10:29.141 --> 1:10:31.810
