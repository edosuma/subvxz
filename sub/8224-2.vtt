00:02.060 --> 00:04.210
On this episode of MythBusters...

00:06.310 --> 00:08.270
We expected something
and something happened.

00:08.440 --> 00:11.740
...Adam and Jamie have a movie
myth they were "<i>Bourne</i>" for.

00:13.720 --> 00:16.460
Can a gas leak and a
magazine in a toaster...

00:16.840 --> 00:19.340
I feel a little bit it's not
going to be very happy in here.

00:19.500 --> 00:21.170
...make a room go kaboom?

00:22.260 --> 00:23.540
I love running for safety.

00:23.780 --> 00:24.440
Then...

00:24.640 --> 00:25.920
I'm starting to get a little nervous.

00:26.090 --> 00:30.220
...Carrie, Grant and Tory tackle
the tall tale of blue ice.

00:30.950 --> 00:32.630
That is incredible!

00:32.820 --> 00:36.760
Can the contents of an airplane's
toilet really fall from the sky...

00:37.030 --> 00:38.720
That thing is falling.

00:38.910 --> 00:40.720
...in one frozen chunk?

00:40.910 --> 00:42.060
This is an awesome day.

00:45.150 --> 00:46.720
Who are the MythBusters?

00:47.320 --> 00:50.990
Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman.

00:51.210 --> 00:52.410
Am I really that ugly?

00:52.600 --> 00:56.250
Between them, more than 30 years
of special effects experience.

00:57.320 --> 00:59.310
Joining them, Grant Imahara...

00:59.570 --> 01:00.460
My God!

01:01.110 --> 01:01.690
...Kari Byron...

01:02.330 --> 01:03.680
I'm gonna wreck this car.

01:04.280 --> 01:05.180
...and Tory Belleci.

01:06.670 --> 01:07.670
We survived.

01:07.980 --> 01:09.760
They don't just tell the myths,

01:11.320 --> 01:13.380
they put them to the test.

01:13.405 --> 01:17.405

01:23.300 --> 01:24.770
Have you seen the "Bourne's Supremacy"?

01:24.780 --> 01:25.770
I love that movie.

01:25.771 --> 01:27.560
I love the whole Bourne trilogy.

01:27.580 --> 01:30.379
Have you got a myth from
"Supremacy" we can test?

01:30.380 --> 01:33.160
There is a scene where Bourne
broke into an apartment

01:33.170 --> 01:34.470
and he knows the bad guys are coming

01:34.560 --> 01:36.200
so he has to make an escape.

01:36.210 --> 01:37.800
What he does was he breaks the gas line

01:37.825 --> 01:40.625
where it goes into the
stove to let the gas flow.

01:40.680 --> 01:42.570
He grabs a magazine, shoves
it into the toaster,

01:42.750 --> 01:46.040
sets the toaster on and 20 seconds later

01:46.240 --> 01:50.260
when the magazine sets on fire
the whole apartment blows up.

01:52.900 --> 01:54.450
So Bourne makes his escape.

01:55.050 --> 01:57.470
That's like perfect for us to test.

01:57.680 --> 01:59.940
I think I have a pretty good
idea where we should start.

02:00.090 --> 02:00.980
OK, but before you tell me

02:00.981 --> 02:04.469
I actually want to demonstrate how
much I love the Bourne movies.

02:04.470 --> 02:05.660
You know I collect movie props.

02:05.950 --> 02:08.639
This is actually Jason Bourne's red bag

02:08.639 --> 02:11.290
from the "Bourne's Identity" in a
waste basket from the Swiss Bank,

02:11.291 --> 02:14.850
not only that, it's actually
full of all of the props

02:14.950 --> 02:16.670
that were actually in that bag in the film.

02:16.900 --> 02:18.790
All these trinkets and
even the stunt pistol.

02:19.590 --> 02:20.620
It's made of rubber.

02:20.810 --> 02:21.630
Isn't that cool?

02:23.360 --> 02:25.780
We need to find out whether
a magazine would actually

02:25.960 --> 02:27.750
set on fire when it's put in a toaster.

02:27.751 --> 02:28.650
OK.

02:32.780 --> 02:35.700
There are three ingredients to
this Bourne-style get-away,

02:35.950 --> 02:39.070
the toaster, the magazine
and the natural gas.

02:39.560 --> 02:41.990
And first in the mix are one and two.

02:42.280 --> 02:44.940
How long does it take to toast a magazine?

02:45.180 --> 02:46.520
- You ready?
- I'm ready.

02:47.450 --> 02:48.810
The guys start the clock

02:49.040 --> 02:51.380
using a magazine like the one in the movie,

02:51.580 --> 02:53.630
and the toaster rigged to stay "on".

02:54.530 --> 02:57.620
You know in the movie it was
already on fire at this point.

02:58.770 --> 03:01.180
As it turns out, toasting
a magazine takes a

03:01.370 --> 03:03.700
little longer than the
20 seconds of the film.

03:04.700 --> 03:05.870
Three minutes over schedule.

03:06.540 --> 03:07.780
I think we're really close.

03:08.040 --> 03:11.710
In fact it takes over 12 minutes
before they get ignition.

03:12.240 --> 03:14.420
Hey! We got fire. Ta-da!

03:17.460 --> 03:19.320
Remember kids, we're professionals.

03:23.520 --> 03:25.580
So reality's 12 minutes versus

03:25.770 --> 03:28.410
the movie's 25-some-odd seconds.

03:28.620 --> 03:29.740
Hey! We got fire.

03:29.970 --> 03:30.790
What do you think?

03:31.100 --> 03:34.610
Well, what I think is that this
magazine is a worst case scenario,

03:34.860 --> 03:37.160
because... look how thick those pages are.

03:37.700 --> 03:40.750
And magazines are all
different shapes and sizes.

03:40.980 --> 03:42.810
So, you think we should try a whole
bunch of different kinds of magazines

03:42.930 --> 03:45.680
and see if they have different
rates at which they catch on fire.

03:45.890 --> 03:46.430
Exactly.

03:46.620 --> 03:47.530
I love it. Let's do it.

03:48.590 --> 03:49.680
Lots of toasters now.

03:50.100 --> 03:52.390
It's clear the real world magazine

03:52.570 --> 03:54.720
doesn't light up like
its movie counterpart.

03:54.910 --> 03:56.390
So now the MythBusters

03:56.560 --> 03:58.720
are on the trail of a best case scenario.

03:59.310 --> 04:01.690
In order to cover our basis here
and working off the theory that

04:01.700 --> 04:04.380
different type of magazines composed
of different kinds of paper

04:04.470 --> 04:07.450
are going to catch alight
at different rates,

04:07.630 --> 04:09.120
we're about to put a half
dozen of them to the test.

04:09.320 --> 04:10.650
Everything from our original magazine

04:10.800 --> 04:12.380
to something much harder to catch on fire,

04:12.730 --> 04:16.079
comic book, something that would
probably catch on fire in like seconds.

04:16.250 --> 04:17.910
We're gonna put one in
each of these toasters,

04:18.089 --> 04:21.360
start this timer and log how long
each of them takes to catch alight.

04:21.750 --> 04:22.730
What could be more fun?

04:23.730 --> 04:25.800
Well, with the six magazines in place,

04:26.070 --> 04:28.460
let the char grilling challenge commence.

04:29.590 --> 04:32.910
We're experimentally doing something
that should just never ever be done.

04:33.350 --> 04:34.110
I like that.

04:35.860 --> 04:39.200
- Flame.
- Number three, 1 minute, 40 seconds.

04:39.480 --> 04:40.970
This time around it seems the

04:41.160 --> 04:43.420
contenders are a little quicker to toast.

04:44.940 --> 04:46.370
2'20".

04:46.380 --> 04:47.100
Yep.

04:47.190 --> 04:48.050
Here we go.

04:48.230 --> 04:51.080
Number 4, 3 minutes, 15 seconds.

04:51.410 --> 04:53.520
Ow! Number 1, 3 minutes, 20 seconds.

04:54.840 --> 04:56.440
Let's listen for that sound.

04:57.960 --> 04:58.790
There we go.

04:59.120 --> 05:00.040
There it is.

05:00.240 --> 05:02.160
Four minutes, 36 seconds.

05:02.510 --> 05:04.630
And finally bringing up the rear...

05:04.840 --> 05:05.580
There it is.

05:05.770 --> 05:08.380
...is the original magazine at 12 minutes.

05:10.470 --> 05:12.550
As we suspected, it does make a difference

05:12.750 --> 05:14.780
what kind of magazine is
stuck in the toaster.

05:15.120 --> 05:16.900
Best case scenario is something

05:17.070 --> 05:18.390
that amounts common newsprint,

05:18.580 --> 05:21.630
but even that took about three times

05:21.820 --> 05:23.860
as long as what it did in the movie.

05:24.530 --> 05:25.440
Interesting.

05:26.380 --> 05:29.560
So it's clear that even with the
best case scenario magazine,

05:29.770 --> 05:31.630
toaster ignition takes a lot longer

05:31.840 --> 05:33.990
than the 20 seconds it took Bourne.

05:35.470 --> 05:39.190
And now to test the next ingredient
of this explosive combination,

05:39.400 --> 05:40.590
the methane.

05:41.250 --> 05:43.330
Now, methane, here, is a natural gas,

05:43.520 --> 05:46.610
and it's most of what comes out of
your stove, at home, to cook with.

05:46.810 --> 05:47.820
It is a flammable gas,

05:47.821 --> 05:50.460
but it's not flammable on its own,
it actually requires a certain

05:50.650 --> 05:53.140
amount of oxygen out of
the air in order to burn.

05:53.610 --> 05:54.720
How much oxygen?

05:55.200 --> 05:57.640
Well, that actually turns out to be
a very particular relationship.

05:57.850 --> 06:01.440
The relationship of oxygen to flammable
gas is called stoichiometry.

06:02.710 --> 06:05.530
To create fire, it takes
heat, fuel and oxygen,

06:06.400 --> 06:08.270
and when it comes to flammable gases,

06:08.450 --> 06:13.780
the amount of fuel to oxygen is a complex
relationship called stoichiometry.

06:14.030 --> 06:17.940
Too much fuel, or too little, and there
will be nothing close to a flame.

06:18.300 --> 06:21.490
But get the perfect mixture
and you'd get an explosion.

06:22.790 --> 06:26.880
Now, according to the movie, it took
Bourne 20 seconds to get that explosive

06:27.070 --> 06:29.420
ratio of air to gas just right.

06:30.060 --> 06:31.220
So, now the MythBusters

06:31.420 --> 06:34.180
are dialing in to find out
exactly what it is.

06:37.980 --> 06:39.890
We know that if we're
gonna get methane to burn,

06:40.060 --> 06:44.140
we need a ratio of between
6% and 17% fuel to air.

06:44.720 --> 06:48.020
The ideal range is about 9%
methane and the rest air.

06:48.570 --> 06:50.830
What we don't know is
what that actually means.

06:51.040 --> 06:54.150
Does that mean if we are a little
off we get sort of a whoof,

06:54.320 --> 06:56.300
but if we get right at the 9%,

06:56.490 --> 06:58.460
we are getting a real strong bang?

06:58.790 --> 07:01.900
Before we go full scale, we wanna
really know what we're doing.

07:02.110 --> 07:07.950
So, what we've done is make a ten inch
by ten inch by ten inch cubic box,

07:08.260 --> 07:11.050
and that will allow us
to really easily dial in

07:12.010 --> 07:13.780
on these ratios to see what it means.

07:14.210 --> 07:15.940
And while Jamie is boxing,

07:16.420 --> 07:18.210
Adam has the ratios in the bag.

07:19.020 --> 07:20.000
One of the ratios I want to

07:20.190 --> 07:22.500
play with is 9% flammable gas to air.

07:23.060 --> 07:26.570
This bag holds 9% of the
volume of this chamber,

07:26.760 --> 07:27.930
I will fill it with gas.

07:29.550 --> 07:31.990
I will then hook it up to the chamber,

07:32.250 --> 07:34.730
open up both of the valves,

07:34.940 --> 07:37.080
press the gas into the chamber.

07:37.400 --> 07:38.800
I'll be displacing air that

07:38.960 --> 07:40.210
comes out of this little hole right here.

07:40.440 --> 07:42.379
Seal it up, walk away,

07:42.380 --> 07:45.310
ignite it with a neon transformer
and see what happens.

07:45.720 --> 07:47.260
Adam's bags will help the guys

07:47.370 --> 07:51.739
zone in on exactly what ratio
of methane to air is explosive.

07:51.740 --> 07:52.740
And speaking of methane...

07:54.070 --> 07:55.770
So that we can ignite this thing safely

07:55.980 --> 07:58.130
we're gonna remotely turn
on this neon transformer

07:58.320 --> 08:00.430
that will create a high voltage spark

08:00.640 --> 08:02.040
inside the methane chamber.

08:02.760 --> 08:05.670
And here, we'll be able to vary
the methane concentrations,

08:05.930 --> 08:08.210
ignite it, and see what we get.

08:08.790 --> 08:09.420
First up,

08:09.590 --> 08:12.490
a test at the very bottom
of the stoichiometric zone.

08:12.730 --> 08:13.870
6 percent.

08:14.060 --> 08:15.090
We're good.

08:15.270 --> 08:15.770
Okay.

08:15.800 --> 08:16.690
6%.

08:17.190 --> 08:20.200
In three, two, one.

08:25.600 --> 08:27.820
We expected something
and something happened.

08:32.789 --> 08:36.400
Our frangible box separated just as
we hoped it would and it's actually

08:36.700 --> 08:39.299
kind of a little bit of a pop.

08:40.559 --> 08:42.500
I was expecting a little
more from an explosion,

08:42.580 --> 08:46.050
and I'm interested to see if our optimal
stoichiometric ratio gives us that.

08:46.400 --> 08:47.160
Me, too.

08:47.380 --> 08:47.998
Well, let's set it up.

08:47.999 --> 08:48.560
Ok.

08:49.230 --> 08:51.350
6% is explosive,

08:51.380 --> 08:55.840
but what if Bourne achieved the
optimal ratio of 9% methane to air?

08:56.650 --> 09:00.260
9% in three, two, one.

09:04.370 --> 09:05.640
Well, that was more energetic.

09:06.510 --> 09:09.360
9% was definitely more energetic,

09:09.550 --> 09:12.750
but for Adam, the surprising
thing is that at both ratios

09:12.930 --> 09:14.470
they scored the mythical explosion

09:14.650 --> 09:15.860
they were looking for.

09:17.840 --> 09:18.870
This is awesome.

09:19.050 --> 09:22.480
We think that 6% means we'll
see a small pop, and 9%

09:22.660 --> 09:23.900
means we will see a big pop.

09:24.090 --> 09:26.000
In this case, that's not the case.

09:26.180 --> 09:28.410
And that actually makes it
look better for this myth.

09:28.590 --> 09:32.030
If we're getting a pop at the very
lowest end of the stoichiometric range,

09:32.240 --> 09:37.160
that's making Bourne's... use of
this as a diversion technique

09:37.670 --> 09:38.810
more feasible.

09:38.990 --> 09:41.340
I'm not saying it's probable, but
it's making it look more feasible.

09:43.330 --> 09:45.700
Later, the MythBusters build a house...

09:46.080 --> 09:47.440
It ain't pretty, but it's home.

09:47.620 --> 09:49.370
...but can the myth bring it down?

09:50.740 --> 09:54.550
And Carrie takes to the skies
on the tale of blue ice.

09:56.000 --> 10:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:07.560 --> 10:08.750
You're looking excited.

10:09.120 --> 10:10.829
That's because we have a myth

10:10.830 --> 10:13.870
that's spectacular, gross, and
challenging, all wrapped up into one.

10:13.900 --> 10:14.690
What's the story?

10:14.860 --> 10:17.650
It's the one with the pilot jettisons
the contents of an airplane toilet,

10:17.830 --> 10:19.900
which promptly freezes at altitude

10:20.060 --> 10:21.600
and turns into a deadly projectile.

10:21.780 --> 10:23.150
Ah, you're talking about
the myth of blue ice?

10:23.350 --> 10:24.350
Exactly.

10:26.950 --> 10:31.340
When mysterious substances of
suspect origin fall from the sky,

10:32.270 --> 10:34.150
urban myths are sure to follow.

10:35.380 --> 10:39.209
And the conspiracy theory that
has the message boards in a spin

10:39.210 --> 10:41.620
is the infamous blue ice.

10:41.860 --> 10:43.270
And here is how it happens.

10:44.910 --> 10:46.840
On a bright sunny day, a passing

10:47.040 --> 10:51.820
pilot supposedly jettisons the
contents of the toilet's tank,

10:52.190 --> 10:55.169
and apparently at high altitudes
the subzero temperatures

10:55.170 --> 10:59.889
freeze the liquid into a damaging
and disgusting missile.

11:01.390 --> 11:03.290
All right, we know a little
bit about airplane toilets

11:03.310 --> 11:04.720
because we did a myth on them.

11:07.450 --> 11:09.960
We know for fact you can't get sucked
into them if you're sitting down.

11:10.360 --> 11:12.200
And we know the reason why it's blue

11:12.201 --> 11:14.200
is because they use that
chemical to cover the smell.

11:14.420 --> 11:15.820
But what we don't know is

11:16.040 --> 11:17.430
what happens to the waste.

11:17.690 --> 11:20.040
Yeah, can you actually eject
the contents in mid-air?

11:20.240 --> 11:21.620
I guess this is where we start.

11:23.570 --> 11:25.909
So, first up, Carrie hits Stockton airport

11:25.910 --> 11:27.470
to find out when and how

11:27.480 --> 11:29.920
a pilot dumps his... waste.

11:31.520 --> 11:32.620
You're an airplane technician.

11:32.830 --> 11:34.780
What do you think of our old blue ice myth?

11:34.850 --> 11:37.400
Well, Carrie, as you can
see from this cockpit,

11:37.560 --> 11:39.470
there are thousands of buttons and switches

11:39.650 --> 11:42.550
of which none are
labeled "Dump the toilet".

11:43.110 --> 11:45.010
Which is bad news for the myth,

11:45.200 --> 11:48.270
but if the pilot can't jettison
the john mid flight,

11:48.460 --> 11:51.540
is there any way the liquid
blue waste can escape?

11:52.610 --> 11:53.820
Failure of components.

11:54.020 --> 11:55.550
So there could be a mechanical problem

11:55.560 --> 11:57.280
that causes the blue ice
instead of the pilot?

11:57.310 --> 12:00.120
Yes. Like with most systems on an airplane,

12:00.290 --> 12:03.750
there are redundancies and with
the lav, it's no different.

12:04.280 --> 12:05.730
Yeap, there are three fail safes

12:05.731 --> 12:08.510
that have to be breached in
order for the liquid to leave.

12:08.750 --> 12:10.670
The dump valve on the holding tank

12:11.060 --> 12:15.100
and two water tight seals leading
to the exterior of the fuselage.

12:15.680 --> 12:19.040
If all three of those components
fail, that's a problem.

12:21.030 --> 12:21.770
It's not likely.

12:21.980 --> 12:22.850
Is it possible?

12:23.040 --> 12:23.790
Absolutely.

12:23.970 --> 12:26.780
Multiple components that
fail leading to a problem.

12:26.960 --> 12:28.280
This myth is looking good.

12:31.490 --> 12:33.000
All right, Kari. So how did it go?

12:33.200 --> 12:34.510
Well, part of this myth isn't looking good.

12:34.680 --> 12:36.460
There's no way for the pilot

12:36.640 --> 12:37.810
to jettison the contents of the toilet.

12:37.990 --> 12:40.750
True. But that doesn't rule out
ice falling off the plane.

12:40.840 --> 12:42.860
That's right. There are still two
scenarios that could happen.

12:43.160 --> 12:44.640
There could be a major malfunction

12:44.830 --> 12:47.050
that leads to either all of the
contents coming out at once

12:47.240 --> 12:48.939
freezing and falling to Earth,

12:48.940 --> 12:51.170
or you could get a nice slow
leak that created an ice ball.

12:51.470 --> 12:52.130
Now, the question is

12:52.410 --> 12:53.440
how are we going to test them?

12:53.610 --> 12:55.270
Actually we've been talking
to our friends at NASA

12:55.460 --> 12:58.820
and they've agreed to let us use
their Icing Research Tunnel

12:59.000 --> 13:03.100
which can simultaneously duplicate
temperatures of minus 20 degrees

13:03.270 --> 13:05.510
and wind speeds up to 250 knots.

13:05.590 --> 13:07.540
That is the perfect
conditions for high altitude.

13:07.770 --> 13:09.699
Well, it sounds like before we leave

13:09.700 --> 13:11.230
we're gonna have to build
a leaky airplane toilet.

13:13.650 --> 13:16.420
Now, this myth is about
airplanes, but in order to test it

13:16.610 --> 13:18.860
we don't need to build a full airplane.

13:19.060 --> 13:20.530
All we need to do is make something

13:20.700 --> 13:23.450
that has similar aerodynamic properties.

13:23.810 --> 13:25.580
So this is our design.

13:26.280 --> 13:29.610
And this will have low drag and

13:31.760 --> 13:34.120
a place to leak which are
the most important things.

13:35.410 --> 13:36.830
So, for their tests at NASA,

13:36.831 --> 13:38.800
Kari builds a waste system

13:38.980 --> 13:40.610
designed to fail in two ways:

13:40.820 --> 13:44.240
either with a slow leak,
or a catastrophic dump.

13:45.490 --> 13:46.920
Now, according to NASA's specs,

13:47.080 --> 13:48.170
it had to be out of aluminum,

13:48.570 --> 13:49.420
'cause that's what our
planes are made of,

13:49.620 --> 13:51.670
and we were not allowed to weld anything,

13:51.860 --> 13:54.330
'cause they didn't want anything
breaking apart inside the wind tunnel,

13:54.820 --> 13:57.520
'cause there was gonna be so much
pressure created by the wind.

13:57.560 --> 14:01.240
So, we had to drill, and rivet,
over six hundred rivets,

14:01.580 --> 14:03.090
to put our airplane together.

14:03.180 --> 14:05.470
And what we have right here is our valve.

14:05.500 --> 14:07.710
This is where we're gonna have
hooked up to a water tank

14:07.760 --> 14:09.190
and we're gonna be doing two tests.

14:09.380 --> 14:12.230
One where we dump the water
completely, and then one

14:12.410 --> 14:15.270
where there's a slow leak,
to find out: can you grow

14:15.470 --> 14:17.170
a chunk of ice on the side of a plane?

14:20.910 --> 14:24.820
Jason Bourne knows how to
make an explosive exit.

14:25.470 --> 14:26.950
But could a magazine in a toaster

14:26.951 --> 14:29.700
really toast a gas filled apartment?

14:32.940 --> 14:34.960
After getting to know
their enemy in the shop,

14:35.160 --> 14:37.180
the guys are ready to go full scale.

14:42.030 --> 14:43.689
If we're going to replicate

14:43.690 --> 14:44.900
the natural gas explosion in this
guy's apartment from the movie,

14:45.090 --> 14:48.120
we're gonna need, clearly, two things.

14:48.780 --> 14:49.990
Yeah, they said get your own show,

14:50.170 --> 14:51.360
it'll open all sorts of doors.

14:51.730 --> 14:54.319
One is methane natural
gas which is easy to get

14:54.320 --> 14:56.910
and two is the guy's apartment

14:57.100 --> 14:58.350
which we don't actually have.

14:58.550 --> 14:59.938
So, we've come out to the bomb range

14:59.939 --> 15:01.210
where they got plenty of room,

15:01.700 --> 15:04.720
and in a few hours we're gonna
build this guy's apartment.

15:04.820 --> 15:06.289
Not to code,

15:06.290 --> 15:08.750
we just need it to be a
gas containment device

15:08.960 --> 15:10.710
that is in the shape of the apartment.

15:10.950 --> 15:13.130
But it will be properly
appointed, I'm sure.

15:13.550 --> 15:18.180
So to find out if you really can get
a room to kaboom with just gas,

15:18.370 --> 15:20.310
a magazine and a toaster,

15:20.520 --> 15:23.260
they'll precisely replicate
the circumstances

15:23.470 --> 15:25.740
of the movie, starting with
the apartment dimensions.

15:25.950 --> 15:27.790
16 by 32 feet.

15:28.930 --> 15:31.169
Once the roof has been successfully raised,

15:31.170 --> 15:33.420
it's time for the resident

15:33.620 --> 15:35.750
exterior decorator to take over.

15:36.360 --> 15:37.710
After you blow enough things up,

15:37.880 --> 15:41.750
you start to look for esthetic
finesse in the explosion.

15:42.150 --> 15:44.270
I'll give you an example:
first hot water heater.

15:44.470 --> 15:46.360
We painted that little house red.

15:51.730 --> 15:52.780
Look at that! Isn't that beautiful?

15:52.990 --> 15:54.750
So we're gonna give the same
treatment to this thing.

15:54.940 --> 15:57.069
We're gonna paint the
outside in lovely orange,

15:57.070 --> 15:58.140
so that when it finally blows up,

15:58.490 --> 16:00.870
the high speed shot will
be especially gorgeous.

16:01.850 --> 16:04.710
Well, it certainly will
be explosively tangerine.

16:10.770 --> 16:11.470
There.

16:11.670 --> 16:13.310
I wouldn't call it livable,

16:13.520 --> 16:14.900
but I'd call it blow up-able.

16:15.580 --> 16:16.910
It is blow up-able.

16:16.920 --> 16:20.320
And the final finishing touches
are to furnish it before

16:20.510 --> 16:21.900
they step on the gas.

16:23.340 --> 16:24.360
Excellent.

16:24.890 --> 16:26.170
It's got a nice view here.

16:26.360 --> 16:27.900
You know? The valley out the window there.

16:29.120 --> 16:30.770
The house may be complete,

16:30.950 --> 16:33.860
but soon it will be filled
with highly flammable gas.

16:34.080 --> 16:37.890
And, in the event they don't get
an ignition, Adam has created this.

16:38.980 --> 16:40.790
What I got here is an exhaust system,

16:40.970 --> 16:43.700
so that I can evacuate
the gas from this room.

16:43.900 --> 16:44.890
Because one of the most dangerous things

16:45.050 --> 16:47.230
that could happen to us in
this experiment is nothing.

16:48.080 --> 16:51.109
We found this on "cell
phone destroys gas station",

16:51.110 --> 16:52.630
we had a room full of gasoline fumes,

16:52.820 --> 16:54.060
and we didn't get it to ignite,

16:54.240 --> 16:56.910
and nobody wants to approach
a room full of fumes.

16:56.980 --> 16:58.560
Hello explosion, hello?

16:59.220 --> 17:02.930
So, if nothing happens I've got a switch I
can turn that will start these fans all up

17:03.100 --> 17:06.980
and get all the gas out of this room,
so it's safe to do a reset.

17:07.550 --> 17:09.560
I think that's the last
piece of the puzzle.

17:09.930 --> 17:11.990
I will get to a safe location.

17:12.849 --> 17:14.930
And that's not the only safety precaution

17:15.119 --> 17:16.440
they're taking with this test.

17:17.560 --> 17:20.430
This is our methane outlet,
which has tin sill on it,

17:20.730 --> 17:22.310
which we'll be able to see moving

17:22.520 --> 17:25.140
if gas is coming through
here on our remote camera.

17:27.930 --> 17:29.270
This is our tank of methane.

17:29.450 --> 17:31.720
We have a regulator, and
a flow meter attached to it.

17:31.920 --> 17:35.680
This rig is set up to give us
the same kind of input of gas

17:35.850 --> 17:38.370
into our house as you would normally have

17:38.530 --> 17:40.950
in a domestic gas line
going into an apartment.

17:41.790 --> 17:44.389
Now this valve here I have
with a line attached to it

17:44.390 --> 17:46.050
that goes to our bunker.

17:46.780 --> 17:49.890
I'm gonna pull on this
line if there is anything

17:50.050 --> 17:51.480
that bothers me about this setting.

17:52.400 --> 17:53.510
Because, you know, it's gas.

17:53.680 --> 17:54.480
It's flammable.

17:54.680 --> 17:55.770
If there's something we don't like

17:55.950 --> 17:57.170
we wanna be able to shut it off.

17:59.680 --> 18:01.890
And from this distance I
can safely pull the plug,

18:02.080 --> 18:03.520
if there's something I don't like.

18:04.310 --> 18:07.880
The list of things Jamie doesn't
like may be a long one,

18:08.040 --> 18:11.120
but if the explosion of the
movie is anything to go by,

18:11.340 --> 18:14.390
putting this myth to the test
could be very dangerous.

18:14.910 --> 18:16.420
Shall we get started?

18:16.445 --> 18:17.229
Yeah.

18:17.230 --> 18:18.040
After you.

18:20.590 --> 18:22.700
Next up, it's full speed ahead.

18:22.900 --> 18:24.850
All stations reporting with the go / no go.

18:25.230 --> 18:27.780
But will the blue ice myth be blown away?

18:33.280 --> 18:34.550
Kari, Grant, and Tori

18:34.551 --> 18:37.870
are tackling the infamous
tall tale of blue ice.

18:38.240 --> 18:40.270
Can a leaking toilet midair lead

18:40.490 --> 18:43.050
to a deadly chunk of ice down there?

18:46.730 --> 18:49.069
To find out for sure,

18:49.070 --> 18:53.180
Tori and Grant touch down in nerd Nirvana.

18:53.370 --> 18:55.240
All stations reporting with a go / no go.

18:55.380 --> 18:57.970
Roger. Prepare to release the geek.

18:58.630 --> 19:02.360
Because this place has a
heap of hard core hardware.

19:02.580 --> 19:05.860
This massive fan is the heart
of NASA's icing tunnel.

19:06.040 --> 19:07.820
It's powered by a 5,000 horsepower

19:08.000 --> 19:10.130
direct drive electric motor.

19:10.340 --> 19:13.190
It has 12 individual custom fan blades

19:13.250 --> 19:15.720
for a diameter of 25 feet.

19:15.910 --> 19:19.690
It's capable of generating
wind speeds over 300 knots.

19:20.010 --> 19:21.820
And that's only half the equation.

19:22.260 --> 19:23.970
This is the other half of the equation.

19:24.190 --> 19:25.570
The icing tunnel itself.

19:25.740 --> 19:27.430
The wind comes rushing through here

19:27.431 --> 19:29.560
refrigerated to minus
20 degrees Fahrenheit.

19:30.610 --> 19:32.780
Those are the spectacular specs.

19:32.970 --> 19:34.950
And now, to put them to good use.

19:35.270 --> 19:36.410
The way we're gonna test this

19:36.411 --> 19:38.779
is we're gonna stick
our section of fuselage

19:38.780 --> 19:40.259
into their wind tunnel...

19:40.260 --> 19:41.530
Does this mean I'm the R2D2?

19:41.820 --> 19:42.770
Oh, boy.

19:42.820 --> 19:45.740
...and recreate the same wind
speeds and temperatures

19:45.940 --> 19:47.610
that you would find at altitude.

19:47.780 --> 19:50.100
Then, we're gonna create
a leak inside the valve,

19:50.630 --> 19:53.850
let it sit there and see if
those conditions would cause

19:54.030 --> 19:57.290
that blue liquid to form
into a chunk of ice.

19:57.790 --> 20:01.690
Remember, there are two leaky
valve scenarios the team will test,

20:01.870 --> 20:04.720
and first up is the catastrophic dump.

20:05.920 --> 20:07.860
We have our model in position.
We're ready to go.

20:08.080 --> 20:09.460
All right. Fire it up.

20:09.470 --> 20:10.650
All right, let's go, fire it up.

20:10.860 --> 20:12.260
Maximum warp.

20:14.220 --> 20:15.100
Sorry, I just made that really...

20:15.300 --> 20:17.180
We're trying to make science cool, dude.

20:17.740 --> 20:18.540
There we go.

20:18.750 --> 20:21.110
And for cool science, let's make it so.

20:24.230 --> 20:27.930
The fan winds up, whipping up a
290 mile an hour wind speed.

20:29.560 --> 20:32.529
Then the heat exchanger
drops the air temperature

20:32.530 --> 20:35.510
to a high altitude minus
20 degrees celsius.

20:36.570 --> 20:39.450
Our model is holding together perfectly.

20:40.740 --> 20:44.170
Then they are ready to pull the pin
on the catastrophic failure test.

20:44.410 --> 20:48.160
Will the blue liquid instantly
freeze into a chunk of blue ice?

20:49.650 --> 20:51.820
So, this is full tank dump.

20:52.050 --> 20:56.510
In three, two, one, go!

20:59.335 --> 21:02.935
- Wow! Wha, ha, ha ha!
- On my God!

21:03.170 --> 21:04.910
Look at how fast is going out.

21:05.890 --> 21:07.320
That is awesome.

21:08.110 --> 21:09.440
As soon as the liquid exits

21:09.540 --> 21:13.130
the aircraft, it's ripped away by
the sheering force of the wind.

21:13.440 --> 21:16.010
And despite the bitterly
cold air temperatures,

21:16.130 --> 21:19.350
it's unable to form the
mythical slice of ice.

21:21.380 --> 21:24.370
Behind me are the results of
our complete release test

21:24.490 --> 21:27.560
where we dump the entire
contents of the waste tank.

21:27.700 --> 21:29.800
Now, it didn't atomize all the way,

21:29.910 --> 21:32.020
because you can see some of
it formed on the surface here,

21:32.130 --> 21:37.600
but it also did not form one big
chunk that could fall on someone.

21:37.700 --> 21:41.730
Yeap, although most of the blue waste was
vaporized on contact with the wind,

21:41.840 --> 21:43.800
some did form a thin layer,

21:43.910 --> 21:46.680
just not enough for a blue icicle.

21:47.910 --> 21:48.710
I mean, it's incredible.

21:48.830 --> 21:51.930
We got an actual layer of
ice, and pretty quickly.

21:52.060 --> 21:54.630
All right, well let's try again,
and this time have the slow leak.

21:54.750 --> 21:57.140
All right, let's see if that
gives us a big chunk of ice.

21:57.340 --> 22:01.590
Once again the NASA techs simulate
the same high altitude conditions

22:01.710 --> 22:04.800
and then sabotage the
plumbing for the drip test.

22:06.470 --> 22:08.840
And once the leak is leaking...

22:11.960 --> 22:13.740
Look how quick the ice is building up.

22:13.830 --> 22:16.580
...the results are astonishing
as they are immediate.

22:16.680 --> 22:18.810
Hey, this is looking great, and it's blue.

22:18.920 --> 22:20.310
That is fantastic.

22:20.440 --> 22:22.960
It hasn't even been two minutes yet.

22:23.680 --> 22:26.830
Oh, my gosh! That is incredible.

22:28.700 --> 22:31.140
The liquid moving over the
surface of the aircraft

22:31.290 --> 22:33.790
is protected from the extreme wind speeds

22:33.880 --> 22:36.100
by what's called a boundary layer.

22:36.940 --> 22:39.810
What that means is that not all the air

22:39.920 --> 22:42.760
traveling over the airplane
goes at the same rate.

22:42.950 --> 22:45.900
Over certain areas, it
actually travels a lot slower.

22:46.070 --> 22:48.110
Which creates a protective cushion

22:48.230 --> 22:50.170
where ice crystals can form.

22:51.160 --> 22:53.800
This thing is like this big.

22:53.930 --> 22:56.180
I'd call that baseball size right there.

22:56.290 --> 22:57.720
If that whole thing broke off,

22:57.920 --> 22:59.890
that would be just like the myth.

23:00.500 --> 23:02.290
The guys are blown away,

23:02.420 --> 23:03.610
unlike the ice.

23:03.730 --> 23:07.920
Question is, how big can
it get, and will it fall off?

23:08.980 --> 23:11.050
I just can't believe how big it's getting.

23:11.210 --> 23:14.200
20 minutes later, with the
diameter around ten inches,

23:14.330 --> 23:17.830
the blue icicle seems to
have reached a size plateau.

23:18.750 --> 23:20.830
It's approaching soccer ball size.

23:21.150 --> 23:23.620
And with plenty of water still in the tank,

23:23.730 --> 23:25.460
that's not the limiting factor,

23:25.580 --> 23:27.990
but Grant thinks he knows what is.

23:28.670 --> 23:30.390
Now, an interesting thing to note here

23:30.550 --> 23:32.170
is that as the ice is getting thicker

23:32.280 --> 23:33.700
and pushing away from the skin,

23:33.860 --> 23:36.490
it's actually pushing its way
out of the boundary layer.

23:36.610 --> 23:38.180
Once it exits the boundary layer,

23:38.270 --> 23:41.330
it actually hits the faster
moving air and... just goes away.

23:41.490 --> 23:43.000
It doesnâ€™t allow it to freeze up.

23:43.090 --> 23:47.640
Which may be a reason why the ice
doesn't get really really big.

23:47.790 --> 23:49.380
Let's see if we can get it to fall off.

23:49.480 --> 23:52.750
Let's pretend like it's at its final
descent, temperatures are rising,

23:52.880 --> 23:54.929
maybe we can get it to break off

23:54.930 --> 23:56.570
and find out exactly what
happens when it does.

23:56.670 --> 23:57.570
Perfect.

23:58.340 --> 23:59.910
All right. Start warming it up.

24:00.890 --> 24:02.210
It's a good theory.

24:02.330 --> 24:05.670
Because as the aircraft descends
and the air temperature warms...

24:06.510 --> 24:08.870
Oh, we're getting bigger
chunks breaking off!

24:09.160 --> 24:11.190
...surely it's only a matter of time before

24:11.290 --> 24:14.860
the blue ice barnacle
becomes a blue ice missile.

24:14.900 --> 24:16.350
Minus 7 degrees.

24:16.470 --> 24:17.890
And, as it turns out,

24:18.030 --> 24:20.030
when the wind tunnel conditions match those

24:20.150 --> 24:22.920
of an altitude of 12,000 feet...

24:24.800 --> 24:26.430
...we have lift off.

24:26.560 --> 24:29.000
That thing blew off in one giant chunk.

24:31.200 --> 24:32.490
That was perfect.

24:32.830 --> 24:36.910
This myth is starting to
look very, very believable.

24:37.010 --> 24:38.520
Yeah, but you know what the next step is?

24:38.650 --> 24:41.730
What happens to the ice after it falls off.

24:41.980 --> 24:43.280
I can't believe it.

24:43.400 --> 24:44.640
Coming up later...

24:44.810 --> 24:47.120
&*^#$ we're burning this building down.

24:53.240 --> 24:54.160
Here is the story we're testing.

24:54.260 --> 24:56.330
Jason Bourne, knowing that
the bad guys are coming,

24:56.420 --> 24:59.260
wanting to buy himself a little
extra time for the chase,

24:59.370 --> 25:02.950
opens up the gas line of the house he's in,

25:04.110 --> 25:07.190
walks over to a toaster, grabs a magazine

25:07.280 --> 25:08.580
and sticks it in that toaster

25:08.680 --> 25:13.330
and sets it as a remote fuse,
and then he exits the house.

25:14.680 --> 25:18.160
30 seconds later, a massive explosion

25:19.840 --> 25:21.520
gives him the lead time he's looking for.

25:21.610 --> 25:23.750
Now, is that remotely plausible?

25:23.820 --> 25:27.190
Well, those are the circumstances we've
got set up in this house right here

25:27.290 --> 25:28.770
and that's gonna be our first test.

25:28.930 --> 25:32.340
In other words, this test will
be exactly like the movie,

25:32.480 --> 25:34.010
but with one exception.

25:34.560 --> 25:38.090
According to our testing, it
actually takes about two minutes

25:38.240 --> 25:40.800
for the toaster to set
the magazine on fire.

25:41.060 --> 25:44.759
So that means that we've had
about four times the amount of gas

25:44.760 --> 25:45.910
going into the room,

25:46.100 --> 25:49.920
in that two minutes, as what Bourne
had, for the whole house to blow up.

25:50.120 --> 25:54.660
Now, that two minutes, in our
case, is only allowing about

25:54.770 --> 25:56.990
seven cubic feet of methane
to go into the house,

25:57.140 --> 25:59.320
and it's rising towards the roof.

25:59.410 --> 26:03.200
Meanwhile, our source of
ignition is about 15 feet away.

26:03.400 --> 26:06.330
I don't expect to see any
kind of explosion at all.

26:06.670 --> 26:08.580
And that's down to stoichiometry.

26:08.750 --> 26:10.830
In theory, for a room this size,

26:10.910 --> 26:13.879
seven cubic feet of methane will be

26:13.880 --> 26:15.740
too low a concentration to ignite.

26:15.840 --> 26:16.680
All right. I'm ready.

26:16.830 --> 26:18.780
Okay, Adam. Go ahead and turn on the gas.

26:18.920 --> 26:19.960
Copy that.

26:20.090 --> 26:21.860
But this is MythBusters,

26:22.000 --> 26:24.470
and it's not a fact until you test it.

26:25.240 --> 26:27.289
It's pretty eerie, watching flammable gas

26:27.290 --> 26:30.260
go into a room in which
we've started a fire.

26:30.590 --> 26:32.810
Or are about to.

26:35.070 --> 26:36.270
Oh, I see some fire.

26:36.400 --> 26:37.290
Fire. Great.

26:37.480 --> 26:38.160
All right.

26:38.290 --> 26:40.630
The magazine may finally be on fire,

26:40.700 --> 26:42.700
but the methane is not igniting.

26:42.980 --> 26:44.810
Oh man. That toaster is totally burning.

26:44.920 --> 26:47.320
And even after a further 60 seconds

26:47.480 --> 26:50.440
there's still no hint of a Hollywood blast.

26:50.530 --> 26:51.540
Gas is off.

26:51.640 --> 26:54.540
Starting up the fans to evacuate the room.

26:56.320 --> 26:58.160
That was cool.

26:58.210 --> 26:59.500
That was very cool. I was
a little... I was a little tense.

26:59.720 --> 27:02.530
Flammable gas, a fire, no boom.

27:02.640 --> 27:03.910
No boom.

27:04.060 --> 27:07.370
So it's time to send in the
MythBusters fire brigade.

27:08.995 --> 27:10.195
Oh, yeah.

27:12.280 --> 27:13.610
There's your problem.

27:17.780 --> 27:20.480
So, we've replicated all the
circumstances for Bourne's

27:20.580 --> 27:22.630
evasion technique, and
it totally didn't work.

27:22.750 --> 27:25.110
I think that's a pretty
clean busting of the myth.

27:25.270 --> 27:26.420
Yeah, it's busted.

27:26.530 --> 27:28.490
- But, you know, I was thinking...
- Yeah?

27:28.500 --> 27:31.280
...if we put something in that
room that burned for longer,

27:31.600 --> 27:33.900
eventually something's gonna happen.

27:34.050 --> 27:37.160
You mean, eventually the gas
and the air will reach a mixture

27:37.270 --> 27:39.090
whereby we will get some kind of reaction?

27:39.190 --> 27:40.640
Yeah.

27:40.780 --> 27:42.610
I love it. I think that
should be the next test.

27:43.120 --> 27:45.500
Although the exact
circumstances of the movie

27:45.570 --> 27:47.700
won't get the bad guys off your tail,

27:47.860 --> 27:51.060
the question is, could a little
more gas and a longer fuse

27:51.170 --> 27:53.930
get the big Bourne boom?

27:54.110 --> 27:56.819
We know from our small
scale testing in our research

27:56.820 --> 27:59.599
that it takes a minimum 6% fuel to air mix

27:59.600 --> 28:02.880
for methane and air to support ignition.

28:03.450 --> 28:07.640
The way we've got it planned out, if we
take the contents of this methane tank

28:07.720 --> 28:09.389
and put it in our test room,

28:09.390 --> 28:11.740
we'll have the right fuel-air mix.

28:11.880 --> 28:14.100
How we're gonna get a long
burning open flame, well

28:14.190 --> 28:15.720
we're throwing out the
toaster and the magazine,

28:15.820 --> 28:18.900
and we're going with a
supermarket fireplace log.

28:19.030 --> 28:22.310
Light this puppy on fire, it
will burn for at least an hour.

28:22.570 --> 28:23.910
This is for real.

28:24.020 --> 28:25.080
The log will burn

28:25.081 --> 28:27.740
while the gas builds to the 6% ratio.

28:27.750 --> 28:28.840
That's it.

28:29.050 --> 28:31.160
But, when it hits the stoichiometric zone,

28:31.260 --> 28:34.650
will they get the bad guy repelling
detonation of the movie?

28:36.180 --> 28:37.970
Back in the safety of the bunker,

28:38.020 --> 28:40.710
at first things go just as planned.

28:40.740 --> 28:43.130
Did you leave a log burning
on the kitchen table?

28:43.680 --> 28:45.800
Oh, crap, I did.

28:46.660 --> 28:50.520
But, in a dramatic turn of
events, after four minutes...

28:51.750 --> 28:53.080
Oh, you know what's happening?

28:53.190 --> 28:57.170
The gas is actually making the
whole room catch on fire.

28:57.390 --> 28:59.970
...things suddenly get incendiary...

28:59.990 --> 29:01.320
I see smoke on the...

29:01.940 --> 29:03.360
$%#^#, we're burning this building down.

29:03.520 --> 29:05.040
...and out of control.

29:09.660 --> 29:10.970
There we go. We had a blow up.

29:11.670 --> 29:13.130
That's it.

29:18.650 --> 29:21.500
Well, I don't know if we're
putting this building out.

29:22.410 --> 29:23.910
Ah, we should get up there with the hose.

29:24.010 --> 29:25.250
All right. Let's turn off the gas.

29:25.610 --> 29:26.570
Gas is off.

29:26.730 --> 29:29.620
The MythBusters initiate
the safety protocols

29:30.140 --> 29:32.830
and cautiously approach
their apartment inferno.

29:33.140 --> 29:33.940
Don't go in.

29:34.390 --> 29:36.340
I'm not seeing any flame.

29:37.450 --> 29:38.870
There's the hole we blew.

29:39.030 --> 29:41.200
It may not have been the
blast of the movie...

29:41.310 --> 29:42.940
It's a horror show in there.

29:43.050 --> 29:45.860
...but the methane sure made
a mess of the apartment.

29:45.960 --> 29:48.250
So all of a sudden, a fire is going
up and reaching the ceiling,

29:48.360 --> 29:50.010
I could see smoke coming out at the top,

29:50.120 --> 29:54.629
and then the mixture hit the
bottom of the stoichiometric range

29:54.630 --> 29:57.080
and we saw this hrrummm!
across the whole room.

29:58.170 --> 30:00.090
I've seen broken glass
on a bunch of windows,

30:00.200 --> 30:01.860
on the back double doors,

30:02.010 --> 30:03.920
it's clear that we got a
significant reaction,

30:04.040 --> 30:06.540
but nothing close to what
we saw in the movie.

30:06.800 --> 30:09.090
Nothing close to a kaboom,

30:09.250 --> 30:11.359
but certainly enough of a conflagration

30:11.360 --> 30:13.480
to distract the bad guys.

30:14.370 --> 30:16.800
It's really clear from all
the melted plastic in there,

30:16.920 --> 30:19.559
and even our exhaust fans melted,

30:19.560 --> 30:22.200
it got super-crazy hot
in there very quickly.

30:22.320 --> 30:24.100
I mean just the whole
room was absolutely...

30:24.450 --> 30:25.950
I didn't even know what
temperature it could be at,

30:26.210 --> 30:27.000
but it was really hot.

30:27.260 --> 30:28.690
But you know we're not
gonna leave it there.

30:28.770 --> 30:30.400
No, no.

30:32.710 --> 30:33.680
Next...

30:33.800 --> 30:35.800
I think Kari is gonna scream her head off.

30:35.810 --> 30:37.770
She may potentially pee her suit.

30:37.900 --> 30:39.298
But I think that block of ice

30:39.299 --> 30:40.700
is gonna land on the
ground in one big chunk.

30:46.630 --> 30:47.500
So here is where we're at.

30:47.700 --> 30:49.170
We've looked into airline toilets

30:49.250 --> 30:51.310
and found that they can leak
through an external valve.

30:51.330 --> 30:53.040
Is it possible? Absolutely.

30:53.190 --> 30:54.789
We've made our own fuselage,

30:54.790 --> 30:56.100
went to NASA's wind tunnel

30:56.200 --> 30:59.340
and found that you could actually
form a giant chunk of ice

30:59.470 --> 31:02.140
which then fell off the airplane.

31:04.180 --> 31:05.460
Now, what we're going to test

31:05.580 --> 31:08.590
is what happens to that ice after it falls.

31:08.740 --> 31:11.040
What we need to see for
this myth to be confirmed

31:11.140 --> 31:14.390
is for that ice to fall through
the air as one giant chunk,

31:14.450 --> 31:18.580
and hit the ground as one
piece with deadly force.

31:19.080 --> 31:22.090
This is the final piece
of the blue ice puzzle.

31:22.460 --> 31:24.730
While falling from 12,000 feet,

31:24.830 --> 31:28.010
at a terminal velocity
of 160 miles per hour,

31:28.180 --> 31:29.880
will the ice stay in one piece,

31:30.150 --> 31:33.190
or will wind erosion and
warming temperatures

31:33.310 --> 31:36.190
cause it to break up into
a harmless blue rain?

31:39.300 --> 31:42.610
To track that, the team has a
spectacular plan of action.

31:43.210 --> 31:44.520
We have our airplane.

31:44.610 --> 31:47.000
We are gonna load it up
with a large chunk of ice,

31:47.070 --> 31:49.090
take it up to altitude
and then throw it out.

31:49.200 --> 31:50.850
Now, we're gonna have a few sky divers

31:50.851 --> 31:52.510
jump out with the ice to track.

31:52.650 --> 31:54.910
Kari is gonna be one of those sky divers.

31:54.990 --> 31:56.900
Yeap, and sky diving team leader Nick

31:57.000 --> 32:00.050
also has the crucial job
of timing the drop.

32:00.220 --> 32:02.129
Because, if the myth is true,

32:02.130 --> 32:04.040
and the blue ice falls in one chunk,

32:04.160 --> 32:06.320
missing the mark could be deadly.

32:06.410 --> 32:08.080
Let's hope they can see that.

32:08.970 --> 32:10.000
Okay, so here's the plan.

32:10.110 --> 32:13.620
Kari and our expert Nick will
go in the plane with the ice.

32:13.710 --> 32:14.620
They're gonna go up,

32:14.621 --> 32:17.940
and based on prevailing conditions
and Nick's calculations,

32:18.060 --> 32:19.560
they'll know when to release the ice,

32:19.690 --> 32:22.280
at an altitude that they deem safe.

32:22.410 --> 32:25.910
Nick will jump out, and so will
Kari, following the ice down.

32:26.480 --> 32:28.140
You'll be fine.

32:29.210 --> 32:30.820
I'm gonna double check this.

32:31.020 --> 32:33.650
Meanwhile, Tori and I will
be on the ground, tracking

32:33.720 --> 32:37.030
the ice in the air and
looking for the impact zone.

32:37.280 --> 32:40.030
And as for the blue ice, well, earlier,

32:40.150 --> 32:42.280
Kari prepared a similar size block

32:42.390 --> 32:43.830
to the test at NASA.

32:44.120 --> 32:46.610
It's approximately the
diameter of a basketball,

32:46.740 --> 32:50.100
eye catching and easily retrievable.

32:50.230 --> 32:52.830
To make sure that we can
watch this ice fall,

32:52.970 --> 32:54.410
I've done something a little different.

32:54.470 --> 32:56.219
I've made it red instead of blue,

32:56.220 --> 32:58.380
so that it's going to
stand out on the blue sky.

32:58.630 --> 33:00.380
I've added some really long streamers

33:00.580 --> 33:01.600
so that we can track it,

33:01.710 --> 33:04.170
and I'm going to put a GPS on it.

33:04.720 --> 33:06.010
Now for this myth to be confirmed,

33:06.100 --> 33:09.310
we need to see that block
of ice drop from altitude,

33:09.420 --> 33:12.710
and get to the Earth in one solid chunk.

33:12.970 --> 33:13.890
Good luck.

33:13.950 --> 33:15.290
- Good luck you guys.
- Thank you!

33:15.610 --> 33:17.030
What I think is gonna happen?

33:17.150 --> 33:19.070
I think Kari is gonna
scream her head off,

33:19.190 --> 33:21.200
she may potentially pee her suit.

33:21.340 --> 33:22.959
But I think that block of ice

33:22.960 --> 33:24.580
is gonna land on the
ground in one big chunk.

33:25.200 --> 33:26.920
Okay. Here is the package.

33:27.560 --> 33:28.940
Good luck.

33:30.240 --> 33:32.100
And despite all of their precautions,

33:32.101 --> 33:33.960
they will need some luck.

33:34.180 --> 33:35.770
Their goal is to drop the ice

33:35.900 --> 33:38.620
and Kari from 12,000 feet...

33:38.840 --> 33:40.220
Here we go, Kari.

33:40.590 --> 33:42.380
...the height at which Grant and Tori

33:42.490 --> 33:45.640
saw the ice release from
the fuselage at NASA.

33:45.940 --> 33:50.010
OK. Now I'm starting to
get a little nervous.

33:50.130 --> 33:51.820
But will it remain intact?

33:51.950 --> 33:55.680
Traveling with an energy of 392,000 joules,

33:55.800 --> 33:58.560
its impact will certainly be deadly.

33:59.790 --> 34:02.740
However, if it melts in
the rising temperatures,

34:02.900 --> 34:04.950
it'll be rendered harmless.

34:06.970 --> 34:10.550
After the break, the MythBusters
touch down for blue ice.

34:12.330 --> 34:13.219
Nice!

34:13.300 --> 34:16.810
And can Adam and Jamie
get a big Bourne boom?

34:23.679 --> 34:27.170
At 12,000 feet, Kari and
her free-falling friends

34:27.260 --> 34:30.060
are preparing to deploy
their blue ice cargo.

34:30.600 --> 34:32.969
All I gotta do is look at the ice. One job!

34:33.480 --> 34:35.370
But will it break up on descent,

34:35.550 --> 34:39.580
or have the devastating impact
internet reports claim?

34:40.159 --> 34:42.800
Ah boy, this is it.

34:43.280 --> 34:47.030
If the team misjudged the timing
of the drop by even a second,

34:47.190 --> 34:51.580
a 35 pound projectile, traveling
at 160 miles per hour

34:51.710 --> 34:54.300
could crash through a neighboring house.

34:55.570 --> 34:59.100
But that's only if the ice
actually stays in one chunk.

34:59.230 --> 35:03.160
If it breaks up, the only thing
busted will be the myth.

35:05.120 --> 35:07.760
I got them.
They are approaching the drop zone.

35:08.630 --> 35:09.580
So, this is it.

35:09.730 --> 35:13.350
It's time to drop out and
jump off for science.

35:18.270 --> 35:19.850
Okay. The ice is away.

35:23.850 --> 35:25.370
So are they.

35:29.620 --> 35:32.320
In a stunning piece of
free-fall camera work,

35:32.550 --> 35:35.640
Nick manages to capture
the ice as it plummets.

35:37.080 --> 35:40.090
- Look how fast it's falling.
- That thing is hauling!

35:40.230 --> 35:43.270
And Kari can see that it's so far, so good.

35:43.390 --> 35:46.520
With the ice already at a balmy 5,000 feet,

35:46.640 --> 35:48.840
it's still completely intact.

35:50.330 --> 35:52.870
Look, it's staying in one chunk.

35:53.030 --> 35:54.500
Dude, that's crazy.

35:54.620 --> 35:59.450
But will it stay that way as they enter
the final few thousand feet of descent?

36:00.070 --> 36:01.290
I see the ice right there,

36:01.400 --> 36:02.960
and is that... is that near the target?

36:03.050 --> 36:04.050
That's great.

36:09.370 --> 36:11.000
Did you see the size of that impact?

36:11.120 --> 36:13.240
And did you see it stayed in one chunk?

36:13.390 --> 36:17.030
Wow, that's maybe only
150 feet from the drop zone.

36:21.920 --> 36:23.030
Let's go meet Kari, and we'll go find it.

36:23.140 --> 36:24.420
All right, let's go get it.

36:25.030 --> 36:27.940
Hi, Tory. Hi Grant.

36:28.060 --> 36:29.120
Here she comes.

36:29.230 --> 36:30.850
She's coming in hot.

36:32.290 --> 36:33.940
- You made it.
- Wow!

36:34.690 --> 36:36.510
Nice.

36:38.790 --> 36:41.050
What a ride and what a test.

36:41.150 --> 36:43.740
And no wonder Kari's
adrenalin is off the charts.

36:43.830 --> 36:44.680
It's a good job.

36:44.860 --> 36:45.930
Let's go check out the ice!

36:46.040 --> 36:47.970
- Did you see it?
- Yeah, yeah.

36:48.700 --> 36:50.540
Everything went according to plan.

36:50.650 --> 36:52.120
For the majority of its decent,

36:52.250 --> 36:57.350
there was visual contact confirming
that the ice retained its shape and mass.

36:57.540 --> 36:59.590
And then, thanks to Kari's visual aids,

37:00.990 --> 37:02.920
and Nick's awesome aim,

37:03.100 --> 37:05.720
finding the impact site is a breeze.

37:06.060 --> 37:07.660
There is a streamer.

37:07.760 --> 37:08.530
Is it intact?

37:08.630 --> 37:10.610
It was a chunk before it hit the ground.

37:10.770 --> 37:13.110
And that is still a chunk of ice.

37:13.260 --> 37:16.600
Check it out. It dug
itself into the ground!

37:16.720 --> 37:19.250
Wow. That is a serious impact.

37:19.420 --> 37:23.030
Yeap, and it may have melted slightly
in the time it took to find it,

37:23.130 --> 37:27.350
but the crater created is a clear
testament to its destructive power.

37:28.820 --> 37:30.550
This is the size of the block of ice

37:30.620 --> 37:33.210
that we threw out of our
plane, which is very similar

37:33.320 --> 37:35.240
to the size of the chunk of ice that

37:35.241 --> 37:38.330
we formed in the wind tunnel
at NASA that fell off.

37:38.930 --> 37:41.800
That block of ice reached
terminal velocity very quickly,

37:41.880 --> 37:44.330
it left a sizable impact crater area,

37:44.400 --> 37:47.090
what's more, it stayed pretty much intact

37:47.210 --> 37:49.340
all the way down to impact.

37:49.550 --> 37:52.830
Okay, a pilot can't release all
of the toilet water at once,

37:52.910 --> 37:54.329
so that part's busted,

37:54.330 --> 37:55.870
but I think the phenomena is confirmed.

37:55.960 --> 37:57.150
I mean, it made it all
the way to the ground.

37:57.240 --> 37:58.350
Totally confirmed.

37:58.450 --> 38:00.090
I agree 100%.

38:00.190 --> 38:02.830
Confirmed. But three mechanical failures

38:02.950 --> 38:04.520
leading to blue ice falling on

38:04.610 --> 38:09.130
your house is in reality
incredibly unlikely.

38:10.880 --> 38:14.470
I'm gonna be looking up for blue ice
to fall on my head now, right?

38:14.590 --> 38:16.120
Dude, I'm gonna get blue ice insurance.

38:16.170 --> 38:17.390
- I... I know a guy.
- Yeah?

38:17.550 --> 38:18.440
Let me know,

38:18.540 --> 38:19.370
I'll give you his number.

38:25.070 --> 38:26.959
At the MythBuster's mansion,

38:26.960 --> 38:29.340
they've been renovating, Bourne style.

38:29.365 --> 38:30.565
No boom!

38:30.920 --> 38:34.590
However, the myth, as it appears
in the movie, is busted.

38:35.770 --> 38:37.670
But it aren't over until the man

38:37.730 --> 38:40.480
in the beret gets a big Bourne boom.

38:40.600 --> 38:43.990
So, next, they are upping
the ante with more gas.

38:44.860 --> 38:47.080
Now, when we empty
this tank into that house

38:47.180 --> 38:51.130
that means we will have just
over 9% methane to air in there,

38:51.210 --> 38:53.680
and that happens to be the butter
zone for an explosion.

38:54.250 --> 38:58.010
The guys know from small
scale that 9% netted them

38:58.100 --> 39:01.520
the most energetic boom.
But this is large scale.

39:01.660 --> 39:05.370
Will this test rip apart
the apartment Bourne style?

39:05.480 --> 39:08.580
Before they blow it up,
they need to spruce it up.

39:08.810 --> 39:11.110
We swapped out all the windows and doors.

39:11.230 --> 39:13.729
All these holes that got warped and open,

39:13.730 --> 39:16.230
we're gonna actually lay
in a bunch of stripping.

39:17.360 --> 39:20.170
We probably tripled the cohesive
strength of this building,

39:20.290 --> 39:23.410
and that ought to give us just
the boom we're looking for.

39:24.640 --> 39:26.770
Jamie is known for how
he handles these fans.

39:28.240 --> 39:30.050
This time around I'm running
the methane into the house

39:30.160 --> 39:32.440
through these holes that
I've attached to the floor,

39:32.540 --> 39:35.470
and I've drilled a lot of little
holes in the hose, so that

39:35.540 --> 39:37.539
we'll get these jets of gas coming out

39:37.540 --> 39:40.220
that will mix with the air

39:40.330 --> 39:42.890
that is being pushed
across with these fans.

39:43.020 --> 39:44.550
Kind of like a blender.

39:44.700 --> 39:46.700
Just mix the air all along.

39:46.790 --> 39:47.910
Yeah.

39:47.990 --> 39:51.090
This squirreling mass of air
I'm hoping will distribute

39:51.160 --> 39:53.410
this fuel air mix throughout the room

39:53.490 --> 39:55.200
and hopefully that will make the difference

39:55.290 --> 39:57.120
between a "poof" and a "bang".

39:57.180 --> 39:59.580
Jamie's fantastic method will circulate

39:59.650 --> 40:01.500
the methane throughout the apartment.

40:01.610 --> 40:05.370
And with the dangerous
ratio of 9% gas to air,

40:05.500 --> 40:08.910
they'll need something
more sophisticated for ignition.

40:09.070 --> 40:11.990
We brought back out the neon transformer
from the small scale testing,

40:12.100 --> 40:14.660
with the addition of a little
piece of paper here.

40:14.770 --> 40:16.100
Go ahead and plug it in.

40:16.200 --> 40:18.090
We're gonna be able to set a fire exactly

40:18.180 --> 40:20.790
when we want to set a fire.

40:21.000 --> 40:25.570
Exactly when they achieve the
goldilocks ratio of 9% methane to air.

40:25.680 --> 40:26.690
Fans are rolling.

40:26.770 --> 40:27.810
That's the last piece of the puzzle.

40:27.890 --> 40:30.470
Shall we get to a safe place and go boom?

40:30.590 --> 40:32.060
- Yeah.
- Awesome.

40:33.930 --> 40:35.840
- Let's turn on the gas.
- Okie-dokie.

40:35.920 --> 40:37.180
All right. We got about five minutes.

40:37.260 --> 40:38.580
Let's get to the bunker.

40:40.120 --> 40:42.210
Fire in the hole.

40:42.850 --> 40:43.879
Hopefully.

40:43.880 --> 40:45.850
Actually, I think they need
a new signal for us, it'll be like...

40:45.960 --> 40:48.850
Fire in the hole!... hopefully.

40:49.020 --> 40:51.500
Fire in the hole!... hopefully.

40:52.860 --> 40:54.080
Hopefully is right.

40:54.210 --> 40:56.930
The precise stoichiometric ratio should be

40:57.010 --> 40:59.040
enough to detonate their apartment.

40:59.160 --> 41:01.270
So our fire starters take cover

41:01.350 --> 41:03.660
as the methane fills the room.

41:04.270 --> 41:07.120
Oh, we're down below
20 cubic feet per minute,

41:07.200 --> 41:09.410
and we're about 100 psi,

41:09.520 --> 41:13.120
so I'm thinking we should
go whenever you are ready.

41:13.270 --> 41:16.200
With the room filled with 9% methane,

41:16.300 --> 41:19.700
will this finally yield
the Hollywood blow out?

41:19.900 --> 41:20.620
All right, here we go.

41:20.700 --> 41:23.310
Ideal gas-air mixture, Bourne explosion

41:23.890 --> 41:26.810
in three, two, one.

41:37.250 --> 41:39.150
That is awesome.

41:39.480 --> 41:41.160
- We blew out the whole front.
- Yeah.

41:41.300 --> 41:43.830
We couldn't have done that if we planned.

41:43.960 --> 41:45.170
That was perfect.

41:47.310 --> 41:49.040
And there you have it.

41:50.770 --> 41:54.830
One magnificent made to
order apartment explosion.

41:59.060 --> 42:01.210
But unlike the movie detonation,

42:01.340 --> 42:04.160
this one is polite enough
to put itself out.

42:04.770 --> 42:05.990
Well, almost.

42:06.110 --> 42:07.970
I hope this is a cautionary tale

42:07.971 --> 42:12.140
what happens when you mix
MythBusters with science.

42:13.910 --> 42:15.210
Ok, here is the thing.

42:15.330 --> 42:17.100
While that was fairly exciting,

42:17.180 --> 42:18.850
I mean we blew out the wall,

42:19.000 --> 42:21.400
I wanna point out that we
didn't break any glass,

42:21.460 --> 42:22.980
there was no bang,

42:23.080 --> 42:24.250
it was a whoosh.

42:24.400 --> 42:27.040
And that's something entirely different
than what we saw in the movie.

42:28.230 --> 42:31.890
The fact that this was an
ideally mixed mixture with fans

42:32.020 --> 42:33.630
and everything in the exact quantity

42:33.750 --> 42:35.829
and that's the best we could do,

42:35.830 --> 42:36.470
kind of tells you

42:36.510 --> 42:39.310
what the real deal is, it's
not what the movie showed.

42:39.830 --> 42:43.290
