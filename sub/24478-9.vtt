WEBVTT

00:03.758 --> 00:05.034
Tracy, Franklin's here.

00:05.172 --> 00:06.241
I'll take care of it.

00:06.379 --> 00:08.172
Tell Gwen I need to see her.

00:09.275 --> 00:10.241
Nut job.

00:10.379 --> 00:12.448
Stop the madness.

00:12.793 --> 00:15.068
Holy shit. Tessa Campanelli?

00:15.206 --> 00:17.068
I know you're sleeping
with my husband,

00:17.206 --> 00:19.689
and frankly he's done better.

00:19.827 --> 00:23.551
So you think you can
just end this, like that?

00:23.689 --> 00:24.931
I just did.

00:25.068 --> 00:26.172
Bennet and I are
sort of moving in together.

00:26.310 --> 00:28.896
Wow, Bennet, this is great.

00:29.034 --> 00:31.379
Derek, Gwen. Gwen, Derek.

00:31.517 --> 00:33.793
Do you wanna get
some dinner tonight?

00:33.931 --> 00:35.103
Not really.

00:35.241 --> 00:36.965
You need to take me off
this trial.

00:37.103 --> 00:38.620
Gwen calls me like five times
a night, and she might actually

00:38.758 --> 00:39.931
be the undead, because
I swear she never sleeps.

00:40.068 --> 00:41.413
Do we have a problem?

00:41.551 --> 00:42.862
We are supposed
to be fighting for justice.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
Wrong! Wrong! Wrong!

00:45.137 --> 00:49.689
Our job is to fight like hell
for every single client.

00:49.827 --> 00:52.172
A white cop killed
by a young black man,

00:52.310 --> 00:54.931
the witnesses say he shot
the officer in self-defense.

00:55.068 --> 00:58.482
The black community... no,
the whole city needs to know

00:58.620 --> 01:00.413
this kid is going
to get a fair trial.

01:00.551 --> 01:02.068
I can't think of
a better attorney than you,

01:02.206 --> 01:03.310
Miss Sullivan.

01:04.103 --> 01:06.310
I'm not resisting!

01:06.448 --> 01:08.896
Jackson Allen Whitmore,
of Washington Heights,

01:09.034 --> 01:12.206
is accused of shooting
officer Jacob Lockman.

01:12.448 --> 01:15.758
He is currently in custody
here at Hollow Brook Hospital,

01:15.896 --> 01:18.689
being treated
for a crushed windpipe.

01:22.103 --> 01:23.344
Could you give us a moment?

01:23.482 --> 01:24.758
I'm not allowed
to leave this room.

01:24.896 --> 01:25.965
You're also not allowed
to interfere

01:26.103 --> 01:27.448
with attorney-client privilege.

01:27.586 --> 01:29.344
You really think
he's gonna make a run for it?

01:29.931 --> 01:31.172
I'll be just outside.

01:34.310 --> 01:36.034
Jackson,
my name is Gwen Sullivan.

01:36.172 --> 01:38.000
I'm gonna be your attorney.

01:39.896 --> 01:41.620
Can you tell me what happened?

01:52.448 --> 01:53.689
Yeah.

01:55.379 --> 01:57.724
What are they charging him with?
Police won't tell us anything.

01:57.862 --> 02:00.000
We haven't seen
the actual complaint yet.

02:00.137 --> 02:01.620
Since there's a cop dead,

02:01.758 --> 02:04.137
pretty sure it's going
to be first degree murder.

02:05.413 --> 02:09.103
My son has a crushed windpipe,
that cop tried to kill him.

02:09.241 --> 02:11.137
And that's exactly
what we're going to argue.

02:11.275 --> 02:12.482
Self-defense.

02:12.620 --> 02:14.241
News is already
calling him a cop killer.

02:14.379 --> 02:16.758
Dawg, my son never been
in trouble a day in his life.

02:16.896 --> 02:18.482
Saves every single
stray he meets.

02:18.620 --> 02:20.655
His vision is to open
his own veterinary hospital

02:20.793 --> 02:22.482
when he grows up because
there ain't one in miles.

02:22.620 --> 02:24.310
That's what they do, okay,

02:24.448 --> 02:27.689
but we will make sure everybody
knows who Jackson really is.

02:27.827 --> 02:29.137
This will not be easy.

02:29.275 --> 02:31.689
We're going to need
some photos of Jackson

02:31.827 --> 02:33.758
and we're going need you

02:33.896 --> 02:35.655
to talk to the press
about your son.

02:35.793 --> 02:39.724
I don't think you want me
to do that, Mr. Riggs, 'cause,

02:39.862 --> 02:42.965
see, I can't play the part of
the grieving mother right now.

02:43.103 --> 02:46.172
Maybe when I'm sure
that Jackson isn't gonna die,

02:46.310 --> 02:49.655
but right now
I'm filled with such an anger,

02:49.793 --> 02:54.275
and rage that I wanna do like
Michael Brown's step father,

02:54.413 --> 02:57.344
and tell everybody,
burn shit to the ground.

02:57.482 --> 03:00.620
So, so no. No, I'm sorry.

03:01.103 --> 03:03.931
You don't want me
talking to the press right now.

03:04.068 --> 03:06.034
If you can excuse me.

03:07.965 --> 03:10.379
The people
have no notices, your honor.

03:10.551 --> 03:11.896
We ask for remand.

03:12.034 --> 03:13.965
- Your honor--
- Don't bother, counselor.

03:14.103 --> 03:16.517
It's murder one.
You know he's gonna be remanded.

03:16.655 --> 03:19.068
Well, I understand the deceased
officer was wearing a body cam.

03:19.206 --> 03:20.379
I want that footage.

03:20.517 --> 03:22.172
That's gonna take
some time for us to get--

03:22.310 --> 03:24.620
Produce it, E.J. Posthaste.

03:24.862 --> 03:27.931
Now, let's proceed.

03:29.413 --> 03:31.137
Jackson Allen Whitmore,

03:31.275 --> 03:33.241
you are charged
with violating Penal Law

03:33.379 --> 03:38.482
Section 125.27.
Murder in the first degree.

03:39.241 --> 03:41.000
How say you?

04:05.517 --> 04:06.551
Hey!

04:06.689 --> 04:07.931
Hey, hey!

04:08.103 --> 04:09.206
All right,
gimme that skateboard.

04:09.344 --> 04:10.379
What?

04:10.517 --> 04:11.965
I said, gimme the skateboard.

04:12.103 --> 04:13.413
What?

04:15.068 --> 04:16.413
- Oh.
- Can you hear me now?

04:16.551 --> 04:18.310
This a joke.
Back up off me, man.

04:18.448 --> 04:20.448
Hey! Don't disrespect me!

04:21.000 --> 04:23.379
The footage
speaks for itself, doesn't it?

04:23.517 --> 04:25.068
The kid mouths off,

04:25.206 --> 04:27.206
then he obviously
gets violent with the officer.

04:27.344 --> 04:31.517
Yeah, to think a good cop
would be killed by some punk,

04:31.655 --> 04:33.482
it's just unconscionable.

04:33.655 --> 04:35.827
Unconscionable.

04:36.482 --> 04:38.344
Jackson Whitmore
is a 20-year-old

04:38.482 --> 04:39.896
community college Junior.

04:40.034 --> 04:42.379
He was skateboarding
in Washington Heights Plaza

04:42.517 --> 04:43.896
when officer Jacob Lockman

04:44.034 --> 04:45.689
told him to
get off his skateboard.

04:45.827 --> 04:47.862
Now, technically skateboarding
in the Plaza is illegal,

04:48.000 --> 04:49.413
but so is spitting
on the sidewalk.

04:49.655 --> 04:51.896
Dashay just turned over
the body cam footage.

04:52.034 --> 04:53.586
Here it is again.

04:53.724 --> 04:55.758
- Back up off me, man.
- Hey, don't disrespect me!

04:55.965 --> 04:57.413
Cuts off right there.

04:58.655 --> 05:00.000
The cop shut it off?

05:00.137 --> 05:01.931
We don't know,
but the two started scuffling,

05:02.068 --> 05:03.517
Jackson ends up
face down on the pavement,

05:03.655 --> 05:05.551
cop on his back,
he's got him in a choke hold.

05:05.689 --> 05:07.310
Geez. Just like Eric Garner.

05:07.448 --> 05:08.517
Exactly.

05:08.758 --> 05:10.206
This is a bystander video.

05:11.034 --> 05:12.586
Now, the bystander
started recording

05:12.724 --> 05:14.068
when he heard Jackson scream.

05:14.206 --> 05:16.344
Jackson, thinking
that he's about to be choked

05:16.482 --> 05:17.931
to death, reaches his hand back,

05:18.068 --> 05:20.931
gets his hand on the officer's
gun, gets off two shots.

05:23.448 --> 05:26.172
Now, unfortunately the bystander
dropped his camera.

05:26.310 --> 05:28.137
Not only don't
we have the crucial moments

05:28.275 --> 05:30.448
of how and why
the chokehold started,

05:30.586 --> 05:32.482
we don't have tape
of the actual shooting.

05:32.620 --> 05:34.379
- What about his partner?
- He missed the whole thing.

05:34.517 --> 05:36.551
He was across the street
at a bodega getting coffee.

05:36.689 --> 05:38.137
So we're looking
at self-defense.

05:38.275 --> 05:40.724
Except the justification statute
says you can't claim

05:40.862 --> 05:43.413
self-defense if you were
resisting arrest.

05:43.551 --> 05:45.034
But go with me here.

05:45.172 --> 05:47.137
What if we argue that
there wasn't an actual arrest?

05:47.275 --> 05:48.862
Oh Honey, that's good.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.931
And even if there was an arrest,
the guy's trachea is crushed.

05:52.068 --> 05:53.275
What does the statute say

05:53.413 --> 05:54.482
about excessive force
in an arrest?

05:54.620 --> 05:56.172
The statute doesn't address it.

05:56.310 --> 05:58.310
Let's do some research.
There must be case law on it.

05:58.448 --> 06:00.620
Well the prosecution's already
painting Jackson as a thug,

06:00.758 --> 06:02.034
and the cop as a fallen hero.

06:02.172 --> 06:03.517
We need to create
a different narrative.

06:03.655 --> 06:05.034
Well the phone's
been ringing off the hook.

06:05.172 --> 06:07.896
MSNBC, CNN,
they all want Gwen to appear.

06:08.034 --> 06:09.586
And we need to find witnesses.

06:09.724 --> 06:11.965
The initial burden is on us
to present some facts to support

06:12.103 --> 06:14.310
self-defense before we can
even take that claim to a jury.

06:14.448 --> 06:15.965
We need to own
the story of what happened

06:16.103 --> 06:18.793
in those missing pieces
of tape before they do.

06:21.482 --> 06:22.862
Wait, where's Vanessa?

06:24.724 --> 06:26.034
She quit last night?

06:26.172 --> 06:28.310
Look at that,
you burnt out the rookie.

06:28.448 --> 06:29.655
Shut up Charlie, she was just--

06:29.793 --> 06:31.793
Way too fancy for this work.

06:31.931 --> 06:34.620
Told you the little one wasn't
ready to roll Sullivan style.

06:34.758 --> 06:36.241
Don't put this on Gwen,

06:36.379 --> 06:38.000
I'm the boss here and I didn't
clock she was struggling.

06:38.137 --> 06:39.827
We should have never
pulled her in on that homicide.

06:39.965 --> 06:42.344
- Or your orbit of crazy.
- This isn't funny.

06:42.482 --> 06:45.448
I liked her, she had
a good heart, she was learning.

06:45.586 --> 06:48.379
And yet she left,
with no notice.

06:48.517 --> 06:50.517
I thought you were
starting to like her too.

06:50.655 --> 06:52.413
Yeah, maybe,
but the no notice thing?

06:52.551 --> 06:55.344
Uh-huh, Bye-bye Bambi.
Good riddance.

07:06.620 --> 07:08.068
You okay?

07:08.517 --> 07:12.275
You really ready
for this fame, infamy?

07:12.517 --> 07:14.034
I don't know.

07:14.172 --> 07:16.206
I mean, I've tried big cases
before but nothing like this.

07:16.344 --> 07:17.862
You know you're gonna
be the target

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
of every ignorant racist
bastard with internet access?

07:20.137 --> 07:21.758
You got thick enough skin?

07:21.896 --> 07:24.000
Oh please, you saw how much
lotion I brought to that spa?

07:25.034 --> 07:26.758
Look, I'm worried about you.

07:27.275 --> 07:29.482
When you take on a case,
you don't eat well

07:29.620 --> 07:31.827
you don't sleep, and you're
addicted to that shit.

07:31.965 --> 07:34.379
Bennet, I know you mean well,
and it's really sweet,

07:34.517 --> 07:38.034
but I don't need you
to take care of me. I'm fine.

07:38.275 --> 07:40.793
Taking care of each other
is the point, Gwen.

07:42.517 --> 07:44.793
Don't get mad,
I made you an appointment

07:44.931 --> 07:46.586
with that nutritionist.

07:47.068 --> 07:49.034
Bennet, I don't
have time for that right now.

07:49.172 --> 07:52.034
Maybe you should make time.
I work long hours too,

07:52.172 --> 07:55.034
and when I take care
of my body well I write better.

07:55.172 --> 07:56.586
I hear you. I do.

07:56.724 --> 07:58.965
It's just that I don't
have time for that right now.

08:00.310 --> 08:02.344
Okay, Miss thick skin.

08:02.724 --> 08:06.206
You just remember, you go
out there, and you get it.

08:06.344 --> 08:07.551
Thanks.

08:37.896 --> 08:40.310
I know you didn't eat breakfast.

08:40.689 --> 08:42.655
Try to force a muffin down.

08:44.448 --> 08:45.931
Or those.

08:47.551 --> 08:48.724
What's this?

08:49.000 --> 08:51.241
You got a letter
from a payday loan place.

08:51.586 --> 08:53.034
I opened it by mistake.

08:53.655 --> 08:55.034
I swear.

08:55.172 --> 08:56.793
Honey, it says you're way
overdue with your payment.

08:56.931 --> 08:58.241
Just leave it, okay?

08:59.620 --> 09:01.137
They sent two letters?

09:01.310 --> 09:04.896
Oh, no, I got my own version
of U.S. Mail delivery hell.

09:07.448 --> 09:09.068
The disciplinary committee?

09:09.448 --> 09:10.689
They're investigating you?

09:10.827 --> 09:12.275
Who filed a complaint, Dodson?

09:12.413 --> 09:16.206
No, he'd be the last person.
If I go down, so does he.

09:16.517 --> 09:18.413
How many judges
have you slept with?

09:19.068 --> 09:21.241
Counting state and federal?
Seven.

09:21.413 --> 09:22.862
Tracy, this is not a joke.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.482
I wasn't joking.

09:26.172 --> 09:27.448
Oh.

09:29.275 --> 09:30.689
Well look,
this is your livelihood.

09:30.827 --> 09:32.310
If you get disbarred
you're done,

09:32.448 --> 09:34.034
so we gotta make
an enemies list.

09:48.896 --> 09:50.827
Judge Fortman and Judge Myers?

09:50.965 --> 09:52.206
Gwen, no judging.

09:52.344 --> 09:53.655
Okay, sorry.

09:53.896 --> 09:55.862
Okay look, I would start
with this one,

09:56.000 --> 09:58.379
and then there's that.

09:58.517 --> 10:00.103
Who's that?

10:00.241 --> 10:02.137
The person in your blind spot,
the one you can't see coming.

10:03.448 --> 10:04.896
Don't tell me
you got a letter too?

10:05.034 --> 10:07.275
Prosecution is moving
to preclude self-defense.

10:13.482 --> 10:16.448
All lives matter!

10:16.586 --> 10:19.620
I'm not resisting!

10:20.034 --> 10:21.793
Officer Jacob Lockman

10:21.931 --> 10:24.931
was a hard-working
veteran police officer,

10:25.482 --> 10:30.517
and now his family is left
without a father and a husband.

10:30.655 --> 10:33.241
All lives matter!

10:33.379 --> 10:36.172
Miss Sullivan, Miss Sullivan,
what's your strategy?

10:36.310 --> 10:37.689
How is your client doing?

10:37.827 --> 10:41.379
My son is a good kid.
He's a college student.

10:41.724 --> 10:44.482
He went out to skateboard.
To skateboard.

10:44.620 --> 10:46.931
And he ended up in the hospital

10:47.068 --> 10:49.586
with a crushed windpipe,
unable to breathe.

10:49.724 --> 10:51.172
Now how does that happen?

10:51.310 --> 10:52.758
I will tell you how it happens,

10:52.896 --> 10:56.482
it happens because
a racist New York City cop

10:56.620 --> 10:59.896
thought that my son
on a skateboard was a threat.

11:00.034 --> 11:02.344
Like so many other
black men in this country,

11:02.482 --> 11:05.758
Jackson was aggressively
confronted by a police officer.

11:05.896 --> 11:08.310
He was about to be killed,
and he acted in self-defense.

11:08.448 --> 11:10.724
We are confident
that a jury will agree with us,

11:10.862 --> 11:12.241
no further comments.

11:12.758 --> 11:14.310
All lives matter!

11:14.448 --> 11:17.275
I'm not resisting!

11:34.172 --> 11:36.620
Chains? Jesus, really?

11:37.620 --> 11:40.793
It's a show of force for the
brothers and sisters in blue.

11:54.103 --> 11:55.275
'Eff me then.

11:55.413 --> 11:56.689
Hey.

12:07.827 --> 12:10.206
Take your bandage off
and sit up straight.

12:16.379 --> 12:17.931
All rise.

12:25.241 --> 12:26.689
Be seated.

12:29.103 --> 12:30.517
I required an escort

12:30.655 --> 12:34.137
to part the Red Sea
of reporters this morning,

12:34.620 --> 12:36.586
and I get the feeling fisticuffs

12:36.724 --> 12:38.137
might break out at any minute.

12:38.413 --> 12:40.000
It's interesting you should
bring that up, Your Honor--

12:40.137 --> 12:42.310
Shouldn't you be sitting
at the other table, counselor?

12:42.448 --> 12:44.310
Ms. Hastings recently
joined our office, Your Honor.

12:44.448 --> 12:47.172
- That's interesting.
- And a conflict of interest.

12:47.310 --> 12:49.448
Your Honor, while I was
recently employed

12:49.586 --> 12:52.896
at the defender association,
I had no exposure to this case,

12:53.034 --> 12:54.379
so there is no conflict.

12:54.517 --> 12:55.758
Oh there's a conflict.

12:55.896 --> 12:58.344
I see no reason
to disqualify counsel.

12:58.827 --> 13:01.103
Now, do People have a motion?

13:01.241 --> 13:02.551
Yes, Your Honor.

13:03.172 --> 13:05.103
Penal Law Section 35.27,

13:05.241 --> 13:07.689
if the force used
in self-defense during--

13:07.827 --> 13:09.344
During an arrest.
Yes, we know,

13:09.482 --> 13:11.827
but the encounter was not
an arrest, it was an assault.

13:11.965 --> 13:13.344
- By whom?
- The officer.

13:13.482 --> 13:15.034
He's the one who actually
committed the crime here,

13:15.172 --> 13:16.586
and if excessive force was used,

13:16.724 --> 13:18.241
then Mr. Whitmore
was within his rights

13:18.379 --> 13:19.551
to act in self-defense.

13:19.689 --> 13:21.931
People V. Stevenson,
People V. Sanses.

13:22.068 --> 13:23.551
She's right Mr. Dashay,

13:23.724 --> 13:25.172
but Miss Sullivan,
do you have any evidence

13:25.310 --> 13:26.620
to support your position?

13:26.758 --> 13:28.172
We've just begun
our investigation, Your Honor--

13:28.310 --> 13:29.724
So then that's a no,

13:29.862 --> 13:31.551
and with self-defense
you have the initial burden.

13:31.689 --> 13:35.310
Now he's right, Miss Sullivan.
You need to make out

13:35.448 --> 13:37.448
a prima facie case
for self-defense,

13:37.586 --> 13:39.931
- otherwise I will preclude it.
- Judge, if you do that--

13:40.068 --> 13:42.827
The whole city
is watching, counselor.

13:43.586 --> 13:48.068
I know it's difficult,
but try to respect the robe.

13:56.724 --> 13:59.000
- Did you just see that?
- See what?

13:59.137 --> 14:01.068
Sleeping with the enemy.

14:06.931 --> 14:08.344
Judas.

14:25.310 --> 14:27.758
Did I ever tell you
how much I hate canvassing?

14:27.896 --> 14:30.689
Yep, just about
every time we do it.

14:30.965 --> 14:34.000
Anyone look like a key witness
to a police shooting?

14:36.068 --> 14:38.689
The policeman asked the kid to
get off the skateboard nicely,

14:38.827 --> 14:41.206
and then a few seconds later
he reached in his pocket

14:41.344 --> 14:42.965
like he was gonna
pull out a gun.

14:43.103 --> 14:44.827
Look, I remember seeing
the cop and a black guy,

14:44.965 --> 14:46.896
they started, they started
shoving each other, you know?

14:47.034 --> 14:48.655
And then the cop,
he pulled out his gun.

14:48.793 --> 14:51.000
Yeah, yeah, I was there.
White boy took out his baton,

14:51.137 --> 14:52.689
and commenced to giving him
a beat down.

14:52.827 --> 14:54.000
And when the kid said what,

14:54.137 --> 14:55.551
the cop said,
can you hear me now?

14:55.689 --> 14:56.965
And the kid just laughed,

14:57.103 --> 14:59.344
and then the cop
became like a crazy person.

14:59.482 --> 15:01.206
He lunged at the kid
like he was in a bar fight,

15:01.344 --> 15:03.551
put him right in a chokehold.
I thought he was gonna kill him.

15:03.689 --> 15:05.827
Did the cop ever say
the kid was under arrest?

15:05.965 --> 15:07.793
I don't think so, no.

15:07.931 --> 15:09.310
Why?

15:10.482 --> 15:13.068
We got lucky,
a carpool mom saw everything.

15:13.206 --> 15:15.896
Says the cop just lost his cool
and went for Jackson.

15:16.034 --> 15:17.137
Will she testify?

15:17.275 --> 15:18.241
Eat.

15:18.379 --> 15:19.724
Says it's her civic duty.

15:19.862 --> 15:21.275
Talk about a unicorn.

15:21.413 --> 15:22.862
Okay this is good, because
maybe it'll establish

15:23.000 --> 15:24.448
that this wasn't an arrest.

15:24.586 --> 15:27.137
Maybe the cop
was the first aggressor.

15:27.275 --> 15:28.827
But we need more.

15:28.965 --> 15:31.517
What about Lockman's
civilian review panel file?

15:31.793 --> 15:33.655
Any issue of him
shutting off his body cam?

15:33.793 --> 15:35.586
Two complaints,
nothing about the cam,

15:35.724 --> 15:37.034
and both were deemed unfounded.

15:37.172 --> 15:38.827
The judge will never
let them in.

15:38.965 --> 15:41.965
If what Janine says is true,
the guy has an anger problem,

15:42.103 --> 15:43.551
and then if that's true

15:43.689 --> 15:45.551
he's gotta have a paper trail
of being an asshole,

15:45.689 --> 15:48.068
or there's somebody out there
with a story to tell about him.

15:48.206 --> 15:49.620
Tracy's right.

15:50.172 --> 15:51.758
We cast a wider net.

15:53.793 --> 15:56.000
Maybe he's clean as a cop,

15:56.172 --> 15:58.034
but there's no way
he's clean as a dude.

15:58.172 --> 15:59.310
Meaning?

15:59.448 --> 16:01.137
Meaning forget
about officer Lockman.

16:01.448 --> 16:03.206
How much do you
know about Jacob Lockman?

16:03.344 --> 16:04.689
I don't like to say
anything bad, okay,

16:04.827 --> 16:07.206
but this guy,
he has some problems.

16:07.344 --> 16:09.758
Yeah yeah,
he always wanted to be a cop.

16:09.896 --> 16:11.793
He liked the power,
I think anyways.

16:11.965 --> 16:14.620
We dated for like, a year.
Nice guy.

16:14.896 --> 16:17.586
This man in a Mustang was
waiting for a parking space.

16:17.724 --> 16:19.551
He honked at me,
so I decide to slow down.

16:19.689 --> 16:23.000
Anyway, I pulled out,
but then our cars touched.

16:23.137 --> 16:25.448
It was a small scratch,
no big deal, nothing happened.

16:25.586 --> 16:26.965
So this guy gets out of his car

16:27.103 --> 16:28.758
and just hits me on the chin.
So we fought.

16:28.896 --> 16:30.206
Did you file a police report?

16:30.344 --> 16:31.689
Yes, but nothing happened.

16:31.827 --> 16:33.482
And no big surprise,
'cause you know why?

16:33.620 --> 16:36.413
Even though he was an asshole,
he was a cop.

16:40.517 --> 16:43.000
Dashay's gotta know
about the fender bender issue.

16:43.137 --> 16:44.689
Well, if there was
a criminal investigation

16:44.827 --> 16:45.931
he absolutely knows.

16:46.068 --> 16:48.310
So how do we get
the police reports?

16:49.655 --> 16:51.724
We request them
in our omnibus motion,

16:51.862 --> 16:54.172
wait for him to trip
on his own shoelaces.

16:56.758 --> 16:58.655
- Excuse me, who are you?
- Are you Gwendolyn?

16:58.793 --> 17:00.793
I'm Glenmore. Bennet, uh,

17:00.931 --> 17:03.379
he scheduled us
for a 2PM consultation.

17:03.517 --> 17:04.827
I'm sorry, I thought you knew.

17:04.965 --> 17:07.379
Lisa was MIA,
and reception was crowded,

17:07.517 --> 17:08.689
so I stuck him in here.

17:08.827 --> 17:11.206
Did you tell her
about the needles yet?

17:11.344 --> 17:12.482
This should be amusing.

17:12.620 --> 17:14.068
Will somebody
please fill me in?

17:14.206 --> 17:16.379
Bennet asked me
to prepare 10 meals per week,

17:16.517 --> 17:18.827
lunch and dinner,
all delivered to the office.

17:19.034 --> 17:20.931
Why do I get the feeling
this is not gonna end well?

17:21.068 --> 17:22.586
Where's the food?

17:22.724 --> 17:25.793
Oh, I have a book, and it's
called The Blood Type Diet.

17:25.931 --> 17:27.793
I won't bore you
with all of the science,

17:27.931 --> 17:30.448
but my diets are tailored
to your blood type,

17:30.586 --> 17:33.827
so I just need a blood sample
before I prepare all the meals.

17:37.103 --> 17:38.896
Okay, that's a good one guys.
Seriously?

17:39.034 --> 17:40.275
Serious.

17:41.034 --> 17:42.034
It's not a joke.

17:42.172 --> 17:43.482
Nope, serious.

17:46.172 --> 17:47.517
Get Dracula out of here.

17:47.655 --> 17:49.896
No, I know it
sounds a bit out there, but--

17:50.034 --> 17:51.620
Glenmore, I appreciate
you coming, I really do,

17:51.758 --> 17:53.413
but if you don't get up
out of my office right now--

17:53.551 --> 17:54.931
Honey, honey, no.

17:55.068 --> 17:56.241
Gwen.

18:02.482 --> 18:04.620
Advance America Payday Loans.

18:04.758 --> 18:06.965
Girl they have
called you four times.

18:07.275 --> 18:08.413
Thanks Lisa.

18:08.551 --> 18:09.965
Yeah.

18:17.310 --> 18:18.413
Hey!

18:18.551 --> 18:19.896
How's it feel
to be on a winning team?

18:20.034 --> 18:21.862
Still adjusting,
it feels a little like whiplash.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.103
Won't take long. A few weeks
of putting the bad guys away

18:24.241 --> 18:26.344
and you'll come to loathe
the defense as much as I do.

18:26.482 --> 18:27.965
Speaking of which,

18:28.103 --> 18:30.448
the defense wants officer
Lockman's disciplinary records,

18:30.586 --> 18:32.379
and internal affairs reports.

18:32.517 --> 18:34.862
He's got an incident,

18:35.103 --> 18:36.896
someone pressed charges
against him.

18:37.034 --> 18:38.689
A fight over a parking space.

18:38.827 --> 18:40.620
- And did it move forward?
- No.

18:40.758 --> 18:41.965
Then it never happened.

18:42.586 --> 18:44.586
E.J., they moved for this stuff,
we have to hand it over.

18:44.724 --> 18:47.034
The last time I did that,
a witness wound up dead.

18:47.172 --> 18:48.413
You were there, remember?

18:48.551 --> 18:49.793
That was different.

18:49.931 --> 18:51.724
This is Brady material,
it's exculpatory.

18:51.862 --> 18:53.413
How is it exculpatory?

18:53.827 --> 18:55.310
If the officer
was the initial aggressor--

18:55.448 --> 18:57.310
It was investigated,
and it never went anywhere.

18:57.448 --> 18:59.793
But they should be able
to talk to the guy themselves.

18:59.931 --> 19:01.310
Why?

19:01.448 --> 19:02.965
We have no indication
that this is a bad cop.

19:03.103 --> 19:04.793
He has a couple
civilian complaints,

19:04.931 --> 19:07.344
so does everyone else that's
been on the force for 20 years.

19:07.482 --> 19:09.931
He has no disciplinary record
to speak of.

19:10.172 --> 19:12.103
E.J., I'm good with getting
the bad guys,

19:12.241 --> 19:14.000
but we have to play fair.

19:15.448 --> 19:16.862
You know what's fair?

19:17.896 --> 19:19.241
Not giving a defense attorney

19:19.379 --> 19:22.517
the ammunition to walk
a cop killer out the door.

19:31.413 --> 19:33.034
Judge, we want to ensure
that the prosecution

19:33.172 --> 19:35.517
has turned over
all discovery to the defense.

19:35.793 --> 19:37.551
The defense has
all pertinent discovery.

19:37.689 --> 19:38.931
Pertinent?

19:39.068 --> 19:40.586
The People have
turned over any and all

19:40.724 --> 19:42.103
discovery to the defense.

19:42.241 --> 19:43.931
Well, that's interesting,
because we've uncovered

19:44.068 --> 19:45.965
a gentleman who is willing
to testify

19:46.103 --> 19:47.724
as to the officer's
history of violence.

19:47.862 --> 19:50.172
Specifically, an incident
over a parking space.

19:50.310 --> 19:51.689
There was
a criminal investigation.

19:51.827 --> 19:53.655
I'm unaware of any
arrest record, Your Honor.

19:53.793 --> 19:55.068
As Mr. Dashay well knows,

19:55.206 --> 19:56.862
we didn't just request
the arrest records

19:57.000 --> 19:59.241
for the officer, we requested
his disciplinary records,

19:59.379 --> 20:01.793
including any internal affairs
investigation reports.

20:01.931 --> 20:03.344
Mr. Dashay,

20:03.482 --> 20:06.241
I'd strongly recommend
that you don't withhold any--

20:06.379 --> 20:07.896
Your Honor...

20:08.034 --> 20:12.206
I uncovered, uhm, discovered
the file just this morning.

20:12.344 --> 20:15.034
I should've let my lead counsel
know that I had it.

20:15.172 --> 20:16.551
Your Honor, I request

20:16.689 --> 20:17.931
that sanctions
be levied against Ms. Hastings.

20:18.068 --> 20:20.034
It was an honest mistake--

20:20.172 --> 20:21.586
She just sat through
that whole back and forth

20:21.724 --> 20:22.793
and didn't say anything.

20:22.931 --> 20:23.862
I'm sorry Your Honor,

20:24.000 --> 20:26.689
I-- It's just, I'm new,

20:26.827 --> 20:31.344
and I am honestly
afraid of Mr. Dashay.

20:34.275 --> 20:37.000
Everyone is allowed
a rookie mistake, Ms. Hastings,

20:37.137 --> 20:38.931
but only one.

20:39.068 --> 20:40.482
Except she's not
a rookie, judge.

20:40.620 --> 20:42.689
She worked for us,
and she knows what discovery is.

20:43.275 --> 20:46.344
Ms. Hastings,
you've just used your one.

20:46.482 --> 20:48.103
We understand each other?

20:48.241 --> 20:49.758
Loud and clear, Your Honor.

20:50.482 --> 20:52.448
Don't ever contradict me
in court again.

20:52.586 --> 20:54.310
I just saved
your ass back there.

20:54.448 --> 20:55.620
You could've been caught lying

20:55.758 --> 20:57.068
to a judge
in front of the press.

20:57.206 --> 20:58.758
I told you that file
was not exculpatory.

20:58.896 --> 21:00.896
Try explaining that to the media
or the general public.

21:01.034 --> 21:02.620
It wasn't your call.

21:02.758 --> 21:04.724
I know the law, E.J., and no
matter what side of it I'm on,

21:04.862 --> 21:06.689
I try really hard to follow it.

21:06.827 --> 21:09.758
I'm sorry you're mad, but
I can't just lie to a judge.

21:09.896 --> 21:11.758
Also, I know Gwen's moves.

21:11.896 --> 21:14.413
She was setting you up,
so you're welcome.

21:14.551 --> 21:15.551
We need to talk.

21:15.689 --> 21:17.103
And it just keeps getting worse.

21:17.241 --> 21:20.344
Go away E.J., this has
nothing to do with you.

21:23.551 --> 21:25.034
What do you want?

21:25.172 --> 21:27.103
I'm gonna ask you one question,
and I want one answer,

21:27.241 --> 21:28.931
and it better be the truth.

21:29.068 --> 21:30.413
Did you report me
to the State Bar?

21:30.551 --> 21:31.758
Wow.

21:31.896 --> 21:32.931
You play Russian roulette
long enough--

21:33.068 --> 21:34.206
Was it you?

21:35.413 --> 21:37.482
Tracy, I don't care enough
about you or the trolls

21:37.620 --> 21:39.862
you sleep with to spend my time
trying to hurt you.

21:40.448 --> 21:41.827
Just tell me.

21:42.034 --> 21:43.482
It wasn't me.

21:49.758 --> 21:52.344
I forgot to ask you,
did you see Glenmore today?

21:52.724 --> 21:54.413
Yeah, about that.

21:54.551 --> 21:56.034
I wasn't gonna say anything,
because frankly

21:56.172 --> 22:00.103
I have to finish my open,
but really?

22:00.655 --> 22:02.586
Pick a diet for your blood type?

22:03.000 --> 22:05.931
The guy wanted to draw
my blood on the spot.

22:06.482 --> 22:08.896
He's lucky
I didn't draw his, or yours.

22:09.275 --> 22:11.000
What's going on with you?

22:11.137 --> 22:13.137
The spa, blood type diets,

22:13.275 --> 22:15.448
that stuff isn't the guy I knew
eight years ago.

22:15.758 --> 22:18.655
Well, maybe I changed a little.
Just trying to help.

22:18.793 --> 22:20.275
Bennet, I don't need help.

22:20.620 --> 22:22.137
And I don't need fixing.

22:22.275 --> 22:23.758
I'm not trying to fix you,

22:23.896 --> 22:26.586
but you do need sleep,
and you can't argue with that.

22:28.068 --> 22:30.482
I've never been able to sleep
before the first day of a trial.

22:30.724 --> 22:31.896
Oh really?

22:32.137 --> 22:35.413
Well, if you are looking
to sleep,

22:36.000 --> 22:41.344
there's a really
good way to sleep.

22:41.655 --> 22:44.620
The mattress
is for sleeping, too.

23:00.241 --> 23:01.586
I was just thinking about

23:01.724 --> 23:04.137
when I saw you
at Nula's that first night,

23:04.413 --> 23:06.586
- I must have been staring.
- I remember thinking,

23:06.724 --> 23:09.068
why is Miss America
on the defense's side?

23:09.206 --> 23:10.586
You did not.

23:10.724 --> 23:12.413
Gwen told me to stop
fraternizing with the enemy.

23:12.551 --> 23:14.206
Yeah that sounds like her.

23:15.206 --> 23:18.827
So, why did you decide
to become a prosecutor

23:18.965 --> 23:20.689
instead of a defense attorney?

23:23.137 --> 23:25.068
I wanted the trial experience,

23:25.206 --> 23:27.241
and connections, you know.

23:27.517 --> 23:29.655
- You want to run for office?
- Maybe.

23:30.724 --> 23:32.034
Why so defensive?

23:32.965 --> 23:35.310
You know how many times
people imply that I'm a bad guy

23:35.448 --> 23:37.931
because I put bad guys
away that look like me?

23:38.793 --> 23:40.827
How many times
I get called a sellout?

23:41.310 --> 23:43.103
Does that ever give you pause,

23:43.379 --> 23:44.758
to prosecute
so many black people?

23:44.896 --> 23:46.758
Of course it gives me pause,

23:46.931 --> 23:49.000
but they committed crimes,
Vanessa.

23:49.448 --> 23:51.793
If they hadn't,
I wouldn't prosecute them.

23:51.965 --> 23:53.172
And most of my cases,

23:53.310 --> 23:55.275
black people are
the ones being victimized.

23:55.517 --> 23:57.517
I mean, shouldn't they
have a prosecutor like me

23:57.655 --> 23:58.931
to pursue justice for them?

23:59.068 --> 24:03.034
Yes, but do you
have to be so hard-core?

24:03.965 --> 24:05.241
Well you are.

24:13.172 --> 24:14.655
My uncle was a cop.

24:14.862 --> 24:16.793
You know, he used to say that
white folks didn't have to carry

24:16.931 --> 24:19.344
the burden of the race
on their shoulder.

24:19.827 --> 24:21.310
They could pursue a career,

24:21.931 --> 24:23.586
get by as best they can.

24:24.344 --> 24:27.965
And prosecutors don't get ahead
by being soft on crime.

24:28.551 --> 24:29.965
I know what Gwen
would say about that.

24:30.103 --> 24:31.655
And I really don't care
what Gwen would say.

24:31.793 --> 24:34.137
You know, you might like her
if you got to know her.

24:34.758 --> 24:37.551
She has a million
funny little quirks.

24:38.344 --> 24:39.758
Oh, yeah?

24:40.482 --> 24:41.655
What's your favorite?

24:42.103 --> 24:44.206
Well, when she has a big trial,

24:44.448 --> 24:47.448
she starts her opening with,
when I was a kid,

24:47.586 --> 24:50.275
I believed
in magic and miracles.

24:50.931 --> 24:52.344
I never noticed that.

24:54.586 --> 24:56.931
Come on, we have a trial soon.

24:59.724 --> 25:02.000
Damn, that's today?

25:05.068 --> 25:07.379
I'm not resisting!

25:07.517 --> 25:09.275
All lives matter!

25:09.413 --> 25:11.241
Open your eyes!

25:11.586 --> 25:14.206
It's the criminal justice system
that's the criminal,

25:14.344 --> 25:16.689
and it's destroying us,
my brothers and sisters--

25:16.827 --> 25:18.206
Franklin, are you okay?

25:18.344 --> 25:20.310
I'm just telling them
it's the system.

25:20.448 --> 25:22.448
- Okay, are you on your meds?
- I'm fine.

25:22.586 --> 25:25.724
I am fine.
I know exactly what I'm doing.

25:26.620 --> 25:28.586
I am not resisting.

25:28.724 --> 25:33.689
Those are the words of a man
being choked by the system!

25:33.827 --> 25:35.241
I can't talk right now.

25:35.655 --> 25:37.344
It's on the thumb drive, okay?

25:37.724 --> 25:39.034
Thanks Akeem.

25:39.896 --> 25:41.448
Nice move in court yesterday.

25:41.862 --> 25:44.241
Reminded me that despite
your recent shitty behavior

25:44.379 --> 25:46.137
you actually do
have principles.

25:46.689 --> 25:48.172
It wasn't personal, you know.

25:48.310 --> 25:50.137
That's funny, because
quitting without telling me

25:50.275 --> 25:51.655
and then showing up
on this case,

25:51.793 --> 25:53.517
that feels pretty personal,
Vanessa.

25:53.655 --> 25:56.275
- I didn't plan that.
- Yet here you are.

25:56.586 --> 25:58.448
Gwen, I'm sorry.

25:59.758 --> 26:01.344
I'll see you in court.

26:06.655 --> 26:08.413
All parties prepared to proceed?

26:09.137 --> 26:10.793
- Yes, Your Honor.
- Yes, Your Honor.

26:18.413 --> 26:21.379
When I was a child, I believed
in magic and miracles,

26:21.655 --> 26:24.241
but as a adult
I must put childish things aside

26:24.379 --> 26:26.448
and look at life
the way it really is.

26:31.206 --> 26:33.620
My partner was a straight up
professional.

26:34.068 --> 26:35.689
His arrests were textbook.

26:36.206 --> 26:37.965
If Jake laid hands on anyone,

26:38.103 --> 26:40.275
he always told them
they were under arrest.

26:40.413 --> 26:41.620
- Objection!
- Objection!

26:41.758 --> 26:43.103
One at a time,
for heaven's sake.

26:43.241 --> 26:44.827
Your Honor, the People
can't possibly think

26:44.965 --> 26:47.310
it's appropriate to offer
completely speculative testimony

26:47.448 --> 26:49.517
regarding the crucial
timeframe in this encounter.

26:49.655 --> 26:51.034
It's habit evidence, Judge.

26:51.172 --> 26:52.379
Overruled.

26:53.482 --> 26:54.793
Would he read them their rights?

26:54.931 --> 26:57.551
Always,
even when he didn't have to.

26:57.689 --> 26:59.000
What about use of force?

26:59.137 --> 27:01.655
We get a lot of training
on the use of force.

27:01.793 --> 27:04.517
We're only allowed to use
the minimum amount of force

27:04.655 --> 27:06.862
necessary to protect ourselves,

27:07.000 --> 27:09.241
and bring the suspect
into police custody.

27:09.448 --> 27:11.689
Jake followed
that rule to the letter.

27:11.827 --> 27:14.793
He had strong feelings
about not being excessive.

27:14.931 --> 27:16.172
He's so full of shit.

27:16.310 --> 27:17.896
Yet your partner
doesn't appear to back off

27:18.034 --> 27:20.034
when the defendant said,
I'm not resisting.

27:20.172 --> 27:21.758
Again, causal speculation.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
I shall allow it.

27:23.655 --> 27:26.655
Defendants always say
they aren't resisting,

27:26.793 --> 27:27.965
even when they are.

27:28.241 --> 27:30.448
I once had a guy
slamming me into a wall,

27:30.586 --> 27:31.931
yelling, I'm not resisting.

27:32.068 --> 27:33.931
And what about the defendant's
crushed trachea?

27:34.068 --> 27:35.827
If Jake crushed
the guy's trachea,

27:35.965 --> 27:38.310
I would say it was
because he was fighting back

27:38.448 --> 27:40.620
against an enormous
amount of physical force.

27:40.758 --> 27:41.965
- Objection!
- Objection!

27:42.103 --> 27:43.310
Sustained.

27:43.482 --> 27:45.344
That's a bridge
too far, Mr. Dashay.

27:45.655 --> 27:48.689
The jury shall
disregard that last answer.

27:49.310 --> 27:51.241
Thank you,
officer Alpern.

27:51.482 --> 27:53.689
We are adjourned,
we'll continue tomorrow.

27:53.827 --> 27:55.241
All rise.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.103
Hello again Audrey.

28:15.241 --> 28:16.827
Oh, are you kidding me?

28:17.034 --> 28:19.482
You've got a lot
of nerve coming to my home.

28:19.620 --> 28:21.655
- I need to talk to you.
- I don't think so.

28:21.793 --> 28:23.379
Please, Audrey?

28:25.620 --> 28:27.137
I just need to know if you made

28:27.275 --> 28:29.724
an ethics complaint
against me to the State Bar.

28:30.172 --> 28:33.517
Oh, so it finally
caught up with you.

28:34.551 --> 28:39.068
If I'm disbarred Audrey,
I have nothing left.

28:39.379 --> 28:40.551
That's not my problem.

28:40.689 --> 28:43.137
Look, I know that
I've done you wrong,

28:44.103 --> 28:45.310
and I am...

28:45.689 --> 28:49.827
I'm sorry if I caused you
or your marriage any pain, I--

28:50.586 --> 28:53.379
An if-pology is not an apology.

28:54.241 --> 28:57.896
Okay, you want me to grovel?
Fall at your feet?

28:58.034 --> 29:00.275
I was wrong to have slept
with your husband,

29:00.413 --> 29:02.000
he is a good man, but--

29:02.275 --> 29:04.931
he is a good man,
but he is your man.

29:06.275 --> 29:09.275
I'm sorry, I'm truly sorry.

29:10.586 --> 29:12.965
You know, I used
to be furious with you,

29:13.827 --> 29:15.655
but now I just pity you.

29:15.793 --> 29:17.172
Audrey, the chicken's done.

29:17.310 --> 29:18.931
I'll be right there.

29:19.344 --> 29:21.931
Listen, if your career goes down

29:22.068 --> 29:24.620
then so does
my soon-to-be ex-husband's,

29:24.758 --> 29:28.620
and I stand
to lose a lot of alimony.

29:29.172 --> 29:32.586
Sorry sweetheart,
but you're just not worth it.

29:49.965 --> 29:52.344
Yes, yes yes
I got the lead character,

29:52.482 --> 29:55.586
yeah, I feel free, I'm loose,
and it's just flowing.

29:55.724 --> 29:57.413
It's flowing, man.

29:57.793 --> 30:00.586
Ronnie, listen to me man,
this is gonna be it.

30:02.655 --> 30:05.241
Promise you. I promise,
I'll have that draft to you

30:05.379 --> 30:06.793
by the end of the week.

30:06.931 --> 30:08.448
I gotta go. All right, bye.

30:10.586 --> 30:11.655
Welcome home, dear.

30:11.793 --> 30:13.517
This looks wonderful, but...

30:14.241 --> 30:17.000
Lesson learned,
it's buffet style.

30:17.172 --> 30:19.655
Grab your food,
retreat to your corner,

30:19.793 --> 30:21.517
and get the work done.

30:23.172 --> 30:25.241
What's wrong? You okay?

30:25.413 --> 30:28.482
No, I'm not.
Dashay stole my opening,

30:28.620 --> 30:30.965
the dead cop's partner
is lying through his teeth,

30:31.103 --> 30:32.758
and my guy is facing
life in prison

30:32.896 --> 30:35.482
having just recovered
from having his trachea crushed,

30:35.620 --> 30:38.172
so... no.

30:40.827 --> 30:42.000
What happened to my food?

30:42.137 --> 30:43.586
The fake food
police came in here.

30:43.724 --> 30:45.034
I fought them off,
but they had a warrant, so--

30:45.172 --> 30:46.448
No seriously,
where are my Flame bolts?

30:46.586 --> 30:48.517
I threw them out.
We had a deal, remember?

30:48.655 --> 30:50.103
After your last trial,

30:50.241 --> 30:51.896
- we said that would be it.
- What is wrong with you?

30:52.034 --> 30:53.827
Why are you so obsessed with
what I eat and what I drink?

30:53.965 --> 30:56.241
- Now you're mad.
- You're damn right I'm mad.

30:56.379 --> 30:57.758
Stop treating me like a child.

30:57.896 --> 30:59.034
Then don't live like one.

30:59.172 --> 31:00.689
News flash,
you're not my parent.

31:00.827 --> 31:02.827
Someone has to be brave enough
to stand up to you

31:02.965 --> 31:04.413
and tell you
when you're in trouble.

31:04.551 --> 31:05.862
The only trouble I have
right now is trying to do

31:06.000 --> 31:07.862
what I need to do
without my Flame bolt...

31:08.896 --> 31:11.448
You know what, I'm gonna
stay down here tonight.

31:11.827 --> 31:13.758
Be easier for me
to work and to think.

31:16.344 --> 31:17.482
Do that.

31:17.758 --> 31:18.689
I'm gonna go for a walk.

31:18.827 --> 31:20.448
- Fine.
- Fine.

31:24.758 --> 31:28.034
Officer Alpern,
let's talk about minimum force.

31:28.172 --> 31:29.793
Isn't it true that...

31:34.034 --> 31:35.448
Oh...

31:36.793 --> 31:37.896
Officer, isn't it--

31:57.758 --> 31:59.275
Charlie.

32:02.137 --> 32:04.827
There's no way Adler's
gonna give us an adjournment.

32:05.000 --> 32:06.103
What if I faked a coma?

32:06.241 --> 32:07.655
He'd never believe it.

32:15.551 --> 32:16.931
Oh it's okay, he can stay.

32:17.689 --> 32:19.275
Good news and bad news,
Miss Sullivan.

32:19.413 --> 32:20.517
Good news first?

32:21.586 --> 32:23.724
The good news is
you didn't have a heart attack.

32:24.310 --> 32:26.586
The bad news is
you do have a small arrhythmia.

32:26.896 --> 32:29.517
Your blood pressure was through
the roof when you came in.

32:29.896 --> 32:31.793
So let me try
to be as clear as I can,

32:32.000 --> 32:34.137
you need to start taking
much better care of yourself.

32:34.827 --> 32:35.862
Okay?

32:36.000 --> 32:37.862
Yeah, okay.
I hear ya, thanks.

32:38.000 --> 32:39.034
Okay.

32:39.172 --> 32:41.586
Hey, he's serious.

32:41.724 --> 32:42.896
I know.

32:44.034 --> 32:45.931
Look, don't go getting
all squishy on me Riggs.

32:46.068 --> 32:47.758
You scared the hell out of me.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.896
Nothing like getting
a 3 AM call from your friend

32:50.034 --> 32:51.517
thinking she's
having a heart attack.

32:51.793 --> 32:53.000
I know.

32:53.689 --> 32:54.827
Thanks.

32:54.965 --> 32:56.413
Now look who's
getting all squishy.

32:56.551 --> 32:58.068
You know what,
next time call the ambulance.

32:58.206 --> 32:59.275
I'll meet you here.

32:59.413 --> 33:01.068
I didn't wanna seem stupid.

33:01.206 --> 33:02.482
Where was Bennet?

33:03.551 --> 33:05.310
- We had a fight.
- And?

33:05.724 --> 33:07.344
And things are fine.

33:07.724 --> 33:09.965
They're fine. Really.

33:11.310 --> 33:12.793
But I'm glad it was you.

33:33.793 --> 33:35.344
I was looking for you.

33:35.482 --> 33:37.379
I figured you went out for
bacon egg and cheese, and um--

33:37.517 --> 33:38.827
Bennet, look, I'm sorry--

33:38.965 --> 33:40.482
I wanted to say,
I'm so sorry about last night.

33:40.620 --> 33:42.103
- I should have listened to you.
- And I'm telling you,

33:42.241 --> 33:43.448
from here on out,
this place is gonna be stocked

33:43.586 --> 33:45.241
to the ceiling with Flame bolts.

33:45.379 --> 33:49.379
Actually, you were right.

33:49.517 --> 33:52.827
Had a little episode last night,
it's a heart palpitation thing.

33:52.965 --> 33:55.655
Not a big deal, but I went
to the ER, and they fitted me--

33:55.793 --> 33:57.379
You went to
the hospital last night?

33:57.517 --> 33:58.620
Why didn't you call me?

33:58.758 --> 34:00.965
Because I was mad,
and embarrassed.

34:01.137 --> 34:03.586
Gwen, I don't want you
to ever have to go through

34:03.724 --> 34:06.413
something like this alone
because you're embarrassed.

34:06.655 --> 34:07.931
You okay?

34:08.068 --> 34:10.172
I'm fine. Turned out
to be almost nothing,

34:10.310 --> 34:11.413
it's a small arrhythmia.

34:11.551 --> 34:12.758
Are you sure? Really?

34:12.896 --> 34:15.137
I promise. Just a scare.

34:15.275 --> 34:16.551
Point made.

34:16.689 --> 34:18.068
Awh, I hate the idea

34:18.206 --> 34:20.586
that you went through
something like this alone.

34:21.000 --> 34:22.379
So, what did you do?

34:22.517 --> 34:25.724
Did you haul yourself
downstairs and hail a cab?

34:27.448 --> 34:29.000
I called an Uber.

34:40.241 --> 34:42.724
Just to be clear, you did not
see the altercation, did you?

34:42.862 --> 34:44.275
That's correct,

34:44.413 --> 34:46.793
I was across the park
getting coffee at a bodega.

34:46.931 --> 34:49.034
I ran over
after I heard the shots.

34:49.172 --> 34:50.517
So you never heard
your partner say anything

34:50.655 --> 34:51.931
about being under arrest?

34:52.068 --> 34:53.310
No.

34:53.448 --> 34:54.827
And surely you'd agree
that not every encounter

34:54.965 --> 34:56.517
with a civilian
leads to an arrest, right?

34:56.655 --> 34:57.896
Of course not.

34:58.034 --> 34:59.517
And when you do
decide to arrest someone,

34:59.655 --> 35:01.275
you always use the
minimum force necessary right?

35:01.413 --> 35:02.206
Yes.

35:02.344 --> 35:03.620
So it is your testimony

35:03.758 --> 35:05.241
that this is
the minimum force necessary?

35:05.379 --> 35:06.275
Hey man!

35:06.413 --> 35:07.551
Stay down.

35:07.689 --> 35:09.482
Stop resisting!
Stop resist--

35:09.620 --> 35:11.034
Hold still.

35:11.206 --> 35:12.551
Stop resisting!

35:15.413 --> 35:17.068
Under the circumstances.

35:17.206 --> 35:19.482
So this child
riding his skateboard

35:19.620 --> 35:21.965
required officer Lockman
to do this?

35:23.965 --> 35:25.827
Under the circumstances, yes.

35:25.965 --> 35:27.965
Now these same police procedures
in your department,

35:28.103 --> 35:30.655
did they also justify
the fatal point-blank shooting

35:30.793 --> 35:32.758
of Warren Henning last year?

35:33.034 --> 35:36.172
Objection Your Honor, this
is outrageous and offensive.

35:36.310 --> 35:37.655
The officer says
the use of force

35:37.793 --> 35:39.103
depends on the circumstances.

35:39.241 --> 35:41.241
I'm allowed
to investigate what he means.

35:42.310 --> 35:46.034
Be aware, you're very
close to the line Miss Sullivan.

35:47.137 --> 35:48.482
You bet.

35:48.620 --> 35:51.241
That was entirely reasonable
under the circumstances.

35:51.379 --> 35:53.620
And what about this,
the beating of Isaiah Marin?

35:53.758 --> 35:54.965
Objection.

35:55.103 --> 35:56.586
Again, yes.

35:56.724 --> 35:59.137
We live in a dangerous world,
some people pose a threat.

35:59.275 --> 36:01.310
And how about
this officer in Cincinnati,

36:01.448 --> 36:04.482
the one who shot Damien Carmore
in the back as he ran away?

36:04.620 --> 36:07.172
We don't know what happened
before that photo was taken--

36:07.310 --> 36:09.172
He was 20 feet away
from the cop, running away.

36:09.310 --> 36:10.448
Is there a question there?

36:10.586 --> 36:12.448
Withdrawn.
In this case, officer,

36:12.586 --> 36:14.827
who had the gun, Jackson
Whitmore or your partner?

36:14.965 --> 36:16.724
- My partner.
- Who had the nightstick?

36:16.862 --> 36:18.172
Who had the taser,
who had backup,

36:18.310 --> 36:19.689
who had martial arts
and combat training?

36:19.827 --> 36:21.034
Objection.

36:21.172 --> 36:22.896
One question
at a time, Miss Sullivan.

36:23.034 --> 36:24.379
Of course.

36:29.862 --> 36:32.206
Officer,
in your 16 years on the force,

36:32.344 --> 36:34.379
have you ever seen
a case of police brutality

36:34.517 --> 36:36.689
that you
did not think was justified?

36:41.137 --> 36:43.551
No? That's what I thought.

36:43.689 --> 36:45.000
No further questions.

37:05.172 --> 37:07.689
You should just close
your twitter account.

37:09.551 --> 37:10.793
It gives me insight.

37:10.931 --> 37:13.000
It's like the
unfiltered id of the city.

37:14.931 --> 37:16.137
So, bed?

37:16.310 --> 37:17.724
I'm not going to bed, Bennet.

37:17.862 --> 37:19.896
Hey, what's with the tone?

37:20.172 --> 37:22.068
I have a tone because I feel
like we keep having

37:22.206 --> 37:24.275
the same conversation,
and I don't understand why.

37:24.413 --> 37:26.965
All I did was ask you
if you were coming to bed.

37:27.103 --> 37:28.241
No you were pushing me.

37:28.379 --> 37:29.758
Gwen, I'm trying to help you.

37:29.896 --> 37:31.241
No, you're trying to control me.

37:31.379 --> 37:33.793
You're trying to make me
into somebody I'm not.

37:34.482 --> 37:37.448
How did this go from
me asking you to come to bed

37:37.586 --> 37:39.034
to me trying to control you?

37:39.172 --> 37:41.034
All you ever do is tell me
what's wrong with me.

37:41.172 --> 37:42.413
I don't get enough sleep,

37:42.551 --> 37:44.172
I don't eat right,
I'm short tempered,

37:44.310 --> 37:46.275
I'm obsessed with work.
But you know what Bennet?

37:46.413 --> 37:47.758
That's who I am.

37:48.137 --> 37:49.413
That's me.

37:49.551 --> 37:52.068
I'm crazy, I'm complicated,
I'm messed up.

37:52.482 --> 37:54.965
God, I really want
for this to work out, but...

37:55.103 --> 37:56.862
Then stop thinking
that this is all about me.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.689
This is a two-way street,
and I'm doing what I do.

37:59.827 --> 38:02.310
And that's
to take care of people.

38:02.482 --> 38:04.620
And why is that
such a big deal

38:04.758 --> 38:05.758
for you to let me do that?

38:05.896 --> 38:07.551
I am letting you do that.

38:07.724 --> 38:09.551
You don't even know how much.

38:09.689 --> 38:11.758
I just left everyone
at the office working

38:11.896 --> 38:13.206
to come back here
and be with you,

38:13.344 --> 38:15.344
and it makes me
wanna jump out of my skin.

38:16.586 --> 38:18.000
Thanks a lot.

38:18.965 --> 38:21.310
This is who I am, Bennet.

38:22.862 --> 38:24.517
My work comes first.

38:24.758 --> 38:27.275
I'm not predicable
or perfect, I'm not sweet.

38:27.413 --> 38:29.034
I am not sweet.

38:29.655 --> 38:31.482
And maybe you can change
who you are for a woman,

38:31.620 --> 38:33.448
and pretend to like vegan food
because that makes you happy,

38:33.586 --> 38:35.758
but that's not me.
I'm not gonna drop everything

38:35.896 --> 38:37.379
and go on a book signing
tour with you,

38:37.517 --> 38:39.517
and learn how to
hand make native foods.

38:39.655 --> 38:41.103
And if you can't
deal with that,

38:41.241 --> 38:43.413
if you can't just
accept me for who I am, then...

38:51.068 --> 38:53.931
So how did you really
get to the hospital last night?

38:58.482 --> 38:59.827
Charlie.

39:01.137 --> 39:02.586
I called Charlie.

39:05.310 --> 39:06.482
You love him?

39:15.724 --> 39:17.206
I trust him.

39:18.413 --> 39:19.655
So that's it.

39:20.896 --> 39:22.517
I think it is.

39:28.965 --> 39:32.827
I'll come by later
to get my things.

39:54.862 --> 39:56.724
New evidence
has come to light today

39:56.862 --> 39:58.896
in the Jackson Whitmore trial.

39:59.034 --> 40:00.586
A rap video
made by the youth...

40:00.724 --> 40:03.172
There you are,
I've been trying to reach you.

40:03.586 --> 40:05.586
I just broke up with Bennet.

40:05.724 --> 40:07.137
Oh, honey.

40:07.275 --> 40:08.862
It seriously
undermines the defendant's...

40:09.000 --> 40:11.551
Then this is really
gonna make you feel terrible.

40:12.758 --> 40:14.413
I don't mess with cops.

40:14.551 --> 40:16.448
Shoot till they body drop.
Shoot till they beg to stop.

40:16.586 --> 40:18.068
Yeah it's going down, they
don't like no black or brown.

40:18.206 --> 40:19.793
Kill them all,
don't make a sound.

40:19.931 --> 40:21.793
Sad I know, why they wanna
fuck up everywhere I go

40:21.931 --> 40:23.655
Line 'em all up,
put 'em on death row,

40:23.793 --> 40:25.586
making me feel
like there's no hope.

40:25.724 --> 40:27.379
Shoot till their body drop.
Shoot till they beg to stop.

40:27.517 --> 40:29.068
Yeah it's going down...

40:34.862 --> 40:36.310
Next time, on In Contempt.

40:36.448 --> 40:37.931
You wanna know
if I tampered with a witness

40:38.068 --> 40:39.620
- and committed a felony?
- You're damn right I do.

40:39.758 --> 40:42.206
That stain kind of looks like
Michael Jackson.

40:42.344 --> 40:44.310
This is an
adversarial process, Vanessa,

40:44.448 --> 40:46.000
not a truth seeking one.

40:46.172 --> 40:47.965
I cannot lose this case, Tom.

40:48.103 --> 40:50.172
I slept with Dods
and tampered with the jury,

40:50.310 --> 40:52.827
and somebody reported me
to the Bar Association.

40:52.965 --> 40:54.103
You're my hero.

40:54.241 --> 40:55.758
You gotta win this,
Miss Sullivan.

40:55.896 --> 40:57.551
I'm not giving them my son.

40:57.689 --> 40:58.724
I know who you are.

40:58.862 --> 40:59.827
We're gonna leave now.

40:59.965 --> 41:01.310
That's why I went to jail!

41:01.448 --> 41:04.448
I am deeply,
deeply in love with you.
