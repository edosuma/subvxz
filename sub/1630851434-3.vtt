00:06.000 --> 00:07.958
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:09.333 --> 00:11.666
Courtly love. Yes.

00:12.833 --> 00:14.166
It's a kind of love

00:14.250 --> 00:16.166
based on…

00:18.166 --> 00:20.875
an idealization of the beloved.

00:20.958 --> 00:24.375
On the unattainable desire
of winning her heart.

00:26.125 --> 00:29.166
Basically,
the desire not to know her at all.

00:29.250 --> 00:32.083
What's the matter, miss?
You don't like the Troubadours?

00:32.166 --> 00:34.458
Not particularly, no.

00:37.708 --> 00:41.333
I think they have
a somewhat belittling vision of women,

00:41.416 --> 00:44.875
who are always the object of desire
without having any of their own.

00:44.958 --> 00:47.416
I didn't ask for your opinion.

00:48.041 --> 00:49.458
Actually, you did.

00:49.541 --> 00:51.375
FACULTY OF LITERATURE AND PHILOSOPHY

00:58.625 --> 00:59.750
Rosa!

01:00.750 --> 01:02.958
They told me you were here
at the front gate.

01:05.750 --> 01:06.583
Hey!

01:07.791 --> 01:09.125
What happened to you?

01:09.875 --> 01:10.875
I failed.

01:10.958 --> 01:13.291
Because I dared to disagree
with the professor.

01:15.583 --> 01:18.125
-Stop crying. Come on.
-What do you want from me?

01:18.708 --> 01:20.750
I wanted to apologize for the other day.

01:20.833 --> 01:22.625
Please, stop. Enough with the lies.

01:22.708 --> 01:24.916
I want to know more about your sister.

01:25.750 --> 01:26.625
Why?

01:28.000 --> 01:30.083
Did you read something else in the cards?

01:32.416 --> 01:35.583
Nora, listen. Tell me what you know
or leave me alone, okay?

01:36.333 --> 01:38.291
First, you have to tell me how it went.

01:44.333 --> 01:45.416
Fine.

01:47.250 --> 01:48.458
But you come with me.

02:03.375 --> 02:06.500
My mom keeps all the things
she doesn't want to throw away up here.

02:08.250 --> 02:09.208
Look.

02:17.833 --> 02:20.708
For a year and a half,
Adele and I were inseparable.

02:31.958 --> 02:34.333
That day, the nanny got distracted.

02:36.958 --> 02:39.166
Adele managed to undo her belt,

02:39.250 --> 02:40.541
and crawl out of here,

02:42.208 --> 02:43.708
and then she disappeared.

02:46.166 --> 02:48.708
We were just babies, but maybe…

02:53.416 --> 02:56.125
Nora, please. If you know something,
you have to tell me.

03:08.458 --> 03:09.875
The birthmark was here.

03:12.416 --> 03:14.500
They covered it up when I was little.

03:17.916 --> 03:19.625
I saw it in an old home movie.

03:20.208 --> 03:22.250
What happened, then? Were you kidnapped?

03:22.333 --> 03:23.416
I don't know.

03:24.208 --> 03:25.583
But in my grandma's scrapbook,

03:25.666 --> 03:27.833
I found a bunch of articles
about your family.

03:27.916 --> 03:30.458
What did your grandmother say?
Did you ask her why?

03:30.541 --> 03:32.500
She won't talk. She won't say a thing.

03:32.583 --> 03:34.875
My dad doesn't know a thing
and my mom's dead, so--

03:34.958 --> 03:39.083
No! Your mother is alive. She's downstairs
and she's desperately looking for you.

03:39.166 --> 03:41.833
We never lost hope, Adele.

03:47.500 --> 03:50.583
Rosa, you can't tell anyone. Anyone.

03:51.291 --> 03:52.291
Why?

03:53.416 --> 03:55.958
We can't be sure.
Maybe it's just a coincidence.

03:56.041 --> 03:58.625
But we have to understand
and find out how things really went.

03:58.708 --> 03:59.875
Don't get crazy!

04:00.833 --> 04:02.708
I knew I shouldn't have told you.

04:02.791 --> 04:04.166
Why are you acting like this?

04:04.250 --> 04:07.583
Because you're everything
I've always hated!

04:07.666 --> 04:09.541
-Who?
-You, rich people!

04:09.625 --> 04:11.500
You're in here, too, you know?

04:11.583 --> 04:13.416
A piece of your past in every box.

04:13.500 --> 04:15.375
You can't pretend you don't know.

04:15.458 --> 04:16.791
I already have a mother.

04:18.708 --> 04:19.583
Had.

04:21.333 --> 04:24.875
And I already have my own box of memories.
I don't need this junk.

04:25.833 --> 04:26.875
I don't want it.

04:27.458 --> 04:28.625
Nora!

04:28.708 --> 04:30.791
-Stop, please!
-Leave me alone!

04:30.875 --> 04:32.625
-Let's talk about it.
-No.

04:35.166 --> 04:36.083
Nora!

04:36.583 --> 04:38.750
Promise me you won't tell anyone.

04:38.833 --> 04:39.833
I promise.

04:40.625 --> 04:43.666
You need time, I know that,
but, please, stay here with me a while.

04:43.750 --> 04:44.833
Honey?

04:45.625 --> 04:46.833
Didn't you have an exam?

04:46.916 --> 04:49.208
Yes, Mommy, but I failed.

04:49.791 --> 04:51.333
So why are you so excited?

04:52.541 --> 04:54.416
Because the professor is a real jerk.

04:55.166 --> 04:56.583
She's right not to care.

04:56.666 --> 04:57.666
Oh, well.

04:58.291 --> 05:00.041
I'm going out to buy a table lamp.

05:00.125 --> 05:01.291
You girls want to come?

05:01.375 --> 05:04.333
-No, thanks.
-It's just a stupid lamp. Let's go!

05:04.416 --> 05:06.125
It's not stupid. It's important.

05:06.208 --> 05:07.791
I need it to draw at night.

05:08.833 --> 05:11.750
Mommy, why don't you show Nora
your drawings?

05:13.333 --> 05:14.583
I don't know.

05:15.791 --> 05:18.541
They're pretty bad, truth be told.

05:18.625 --> 05:20.875
Please, Mommy. It means a lot to me.

05:24.125 --> 05:26.500
This is my daughter Adele,
as I see her today.

05:26.583 --> 05:28.416
This is from two years ago.

05:28.500 --> 05:32.250
This one is how I thought Adele
would be when she was ten.

05:33.083 --> 05:35.375
Back then, I was even worse at drawing.

05:37.375 --> 05:40.875
And this is my daughter Adele
one year after she disappeared.

05:42.750 --> 05:44.916
I hadn't taken drawing lessons yet,

05:45.000 --> 05:47.083
but it's the one
that looks like her the most.

05:47.666 --> 05:48.666
It has to be.

05:49.958 --> 05:51.583
It's beautiful, Mommy.

05:55.083 --> 05:59.000
You know, when you lose a child,
you do silly things.

05:59.625 --> 06:00.708
It's like

06:02.250 --> 06:04.208
you're indulging your imagination.

06:04.708 --> 06:07.958
But the more time goes by,
the sillier it gets.

06:08.041 --> 06:09.833
I realize that, but…

06:11.500 --> 06:13.333
I feel she's close to me, this way.

06:17.041 --> 06:18.458
What can I say, miss?

06:23.000 --> 06:24.291
Please, call me Nora.

06:43.875 --> 06:45.416
All I can see is shadows.

06:45.500 --> 06:47.500
That's because
I need professional equipment.

06:47.583 --> 06:49.708
I can't work miracles in a bathroom.

06:50.375 --> 06:53.125
Matteo, you have to let me use
the darkroom at the newspaper.

06:53.208 --> 06:54.250
Are you nuts?

06:54.791 --> 06:56.750
We have proof of a murder!

06:56.833 --> 06:59.708
The photos of the Loch Ness Monster
are better than these.

06:59.791 --> 07:02.291
-Do you realize that?
-You don't have the expert eye.

07:02.375 --> 07:03.708
-Trust me.
-Listen, Simone.

07:03.791 --> 07:04.875
He's a movie star.

07:04.958 --> 07:07.750
Why would he go around
strangling girls on a Friday night?

07:07.833 --> 07:09.666
-Come on!
-No, wait.

07:09.750 --> 07:11.833
Look at this sequence. Look.

07:13.666 --> 07:15.208
She's uncomfortable, see?

07:16.500 --> 07:18.458
He must have felt rejected.

07:19.583 --> 07:21.458
Yeah. Sorry, but I'm late.

07:21.541 --> 07:23.166
-I have to go.
-Matteo!

07:26.333 --> 07:29.541
I can't get that scream out of my head.

07:36.250 --> 07:38.708
We'll see.
For now, have him sign the contract.

07:39.750 --> 07:40.916
Look at him!

07:41.000 --> 07:44.416
From being a perfect nobody
to hosting a variety show.

07:45.541 --> 07:47.250
A lame show, but still.

07:48.000 --> 07:51.125
My dear, I may be a good talent scout,

07:51.208 --> 07:53.666
but this time you deserve all the credit.

07:54.500 --> 07:55.708
Congratulations.

07:57.541 --> 07:59.500
You think I'm a moron, don't you?

08:00.500 --> 08:03.541
Don't be upset, darling.
I've been doing this for long enough

08:03.625 --> 08:06.625
to know there's a fine line
between being a moron and a genius.

08:06.708 --> 08:09.375
-Especially on TV.
-I'm not upset, no.

08:09.458 --> 08:10.916
I'm way too happy.

08:12.791 --> 08:14.083
Here, then.

08:14.166 --> 08:17.583
Two tickets for the premiere
of my darling Sandro's new movie.

08:18.958 --> 08:22.416
It's time to start showing
this ugly mug around town.

08:23.041 --> 08:24.375
Are you serious?

08:24.458 --> 08:26.458
Bring your girlfriend, if you have one.

08:26.541 --> 08:29.333
No, I don't.
But that's not a problem anymore, right?

08:29.416 --> 08:30.625
Watch me.

08:34.750 --> 08:35.833
Miss?

08:37.083 --> 08:41.333
Would you like to come to the premiere of
Sandro Ralli's new movie with me tomorrow?

08:41.875 --> 08:42.958
No, thanks.

08:48.916 --> 08:50.541
Sandro Ralli is relaxing

08:50.625 --> 08:53.625
ahead of the premiere
of his new movie, Bello al Ballo.

08:53.708 --> 08:58.041
Here, he's walking in Villa Borghese,
hand in hand with Linda Pertica,

08:58.125 --> 09:00.208
his partner in the film.

09:00.291 --> 09:04.000
Could it be love off screen too?
Who knows.

09:04.083 --> 09:08.250
Meanwhile, tomorrow night we will see them
for the first time on the big screen,

09:08.333 --> 09:09.666
dancing the twist.

09:10.333 --> 09:12.875
A dance from the US that's taking--

09:19.916 --> 09:22.416
-Hello?
-Hi, Lando? It's Tullio.

09:22.500 --> 09:24.416
-Tullio?
-How's it going?

09:25.666 --> 09:27.291
Everything is fine. Thanks.

09:27.375 --> 09:29.250
Quite an eventful dinner we had, huh?

09:29.333 --> 09:30.208
I'd say so.

09:30.291 --> 09:33.291
But it was also kind of fun, wasn't it?

09:33.958 --> 09:35.083
I'm not so sure.

09:35.833 --> 09:39.833
Come on. At least it wasn't the same old
boring dinner. It was exciting.

09:40.333 --> 09:44.416
You and Doriana were honest
and straight to the point. I liked that.

09:44.500 --> 09:47.458
For some reason, no one has the courage
to talk to me like that.

09:47.541 --> 09:49.000
Maybe it's because I'm so rich.

09:49.083 --> 09:51.083
They must feel intimidated. Who knows?

09:51.166 --> 09:52.916
Well, thank you.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.958
There was something else
I wanted to talk about.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.750
It's about my land.

09:58.833 --> 10:01.625
-That I pinched from you.
-You're quite direct yourself.

10:01.708 --> 10:06.000
Well, what's the point of pretending?
We both know how the world works.

10:06.083 --> 10:07.750
Of course.

10:07.833 --> 10:09.916
So what did you want to talk about?

10:10.000 --> 10:13.125
I was thinking
that maybe we could find a way

10:13.208 --> 10:15.666
for my project to include

10:16.500 --> 10:19.791
your shelter for bums.

10:19.875 --> 10:21.375
What do you mean, "bums"?

10:21.958 --> 10:24.791
This thing could be convenient for me too.

10:24.875 --> 10:28.166
If it's a charity,
I'll be able to save on some taxes.

10:28.875 --> 10:31.208
I understand. That sounds interesting.

10:32.041 --> 10:33.125
Let's talk about it.

10:33.625 --> 10:35.708
Why don't we have another dinner?

10:35.791 --> 10:39.708
-No.
-We'd love to.

10:39.791 --> 10:42.625
We'll return
your kind dinner invitation, then.

10:42.708 --> 10:44.416
I accept the invitation.

10:44.500 --> 10:45.958
Gladly. Thank you, Lando.

10:46.041 --> 10:47.625
Say hi to Doriana for me.

10:47.708 --> 10:50.250
Of course. I sure will. Bye, Tullio.

10:50.333 --> 10:51.166
Thank you.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.708
THE ITALIAN GAZETTE

11:09.583 --> 11:12.666
How can I help you
if you don't know this Goia's surname?

11:12.750 --> 11:15.208
She's Sardinian.
She auditioned at Cinecittà.

11:15.291 --> 11:18.250
Try and go there.
Maybe you'll find out her surname.

11:19.125 --> 11:21.208
But no one's looking for her. We'd know.

11:21.291 --> 11:23.625
No dead bodies
found on the beach this morning?

11:24.208 --> 11:26.875
-Where? What beach?
-No, I'll talk to the chief editor.

11:26.958 --> 11:29.416
Unfortunately,
there's nothing to say. Thank you.

11:29.500 --> 11:30.458
Let's go.

11:35.833 --> 11:37.833
Let's at least show the photos
to the editor.

11:37.916 --> 11:41.166
No way. Go to Cinecittà
and find out what Gioia's last name was.

11:41.250 --> 11:43.833
No, wait. I'll talk to Giggi first.
He knows Ralli.

11:43.916 --> 11:46.291
All Ralli did was fix his hair
with his saliva!

11:48.500 --> 11:52.208
Seriously, Simone.
Don't get Giggi involved, please.

11:57.041 --> 11:59.416
Look at this one.
It looks like Giggi. Let's buy it.

11:59.500 --> 12:00.625
-It's true.
-Right?

12:00.708 --> 12:03.083
Let's prank him
and put it in his bedroom tonight.

12:03.166 --> 12:05.333
Yes! It looks just like him.

12:05.875 --> 12:08.166
My husband likes modern gadgets,

12:08.250 --> 12:11.416
but I'm very into all these old trinkets.

12:12.625 --> 12:14.375
What a beauty! Look at this.

12:14.916 --> 12:16.916
And what is this?

12:17.708 --> 12:18.875
It's a gyroscope.

12:20.541 --> 12:21.875
A gyroscope?

12:22.375 --> 12:24.083
Oh, and what's that?

12:24.166 --> 12:28.458
It's used to balance bicycles,
airplanes, anything that moves.

12:29.833 --> 12:30.791
Nice.

12:31.791 --> 12:35.166
My dad needs one to build some cars
that run around a track,

12:35.250 --> 12:37.208
but he can't afford it.

12:38.125 --> 12:40.291
But, dear, let me buy it for you!

12:40.916 --> 12:42.958
No, that's not what I meant. Don't--

12:43.041 --> 12:44.416
But it's nothing. I insist.

12:44.500 --> 12:46.333
She really wants to. It's nothing.

12:46.416 --> 12:48.583
-It's probably old and broken.
-It's decided.

12:48.666 --> 12:50.208
Giorgio, we'll take it.

12:58.791 --> 13:01.541
How is it Matteo's fault
that you failed the exam?

13:01.625 --> 13:04.666
I don't know.
I was nervous because of our argument.

13:04.750 --> 13:07.416
And the topic of the exam
didn't help, you know?

13:07.500 --> 13:09.083
Courtly love. Please!

13:09.666 --> 13:11.583
It's done more harm than the atomic bomb.

13:11.666 --> 13:12.541
Darling.

13:13.791 --> 13:15.500
Why don't you make up with Matteo?

13:15.583 --> 13:17.250
He's such a dear boy.

13:17.333 --> 13:19.875
Yes, but he's so uptight.

13:20.666 --> 13:21.791
He's cowardly.

13:23.083 --> 13:24.291
He's petulant.

13:25.625 --> 13:27.458
But do you like him? Huh?

13:28.833 --> 13:30.166
I mean, if you like him,

13:31.375 --> 13:32.500
if she likes him.

13:33.125 --> 13:34.958
I would be a bad mother, otherwise.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.750
I try my best to be a good mother.

13:40.666 --> 13:42.708
But there's no need, actually,

13:42.791 --> 13:45.458
because my daughter is perfect.

13:45.541 --> 13:47.291
My mom is perfect too.

13:54.250 --> 13:56.125
What about your mother?

14:00.291 --> 14:01.291
Perfect.

14:04.125 --> 14:05.708
But she's dead now.

14:06.916 --> 14:08.125
I'm really sorry.

14:08.875 --> 14:10.041
Don't worry.

14:13.166 --> 14:14.750
What do you think about Matteo?

14:16.625 --> 14:20.041
What should I think about a guy
who wears a scarf in this heat?

14:20.125 --> 14:21.958
It's just a little quirk he has.

14:22.041 --> 14:24.708
It's really late, girls. We have to go.

14:30.166 --> 14:31.250
Wait.

14:33.208 --> 14:34.250
Thanks.

14:37.083 --> 14:38.833
Wait. Let me help you.

14:40.875 --> 14:41.708
Thank you.

14:44.916 --> 14:45.875
Here you go.

14:49.416 --> 14:52.208
It's Chanel N° 5. Did I put too much on?

14:55.041 --> 14:58.708
You recognized it, right?
Well, all the ladies are wearing it now.

14:58.791 --> 15:00.125
Let's go, dear. Come on.

15:04.625 --> 15:07.041
This idiot wants to turn himself in!

15:07.125 --> 15:09.750
It was just a tragic accident!

15:10.333 --> 15:13.833
My son is too naive, too honest.
They'll tear him apart.

15:13.916 --> 15:17.208
Sandro, your mother's right.
You do that, they'll rip you apart.

15:17.291 --> 15:19.000
The judge, the newspapers,

15:19.083 --> 15:21.166
they'll grind you down
to your pinkie finger.

15:21.250 --> 15:24.375
You'll go to jail and she'll go back
to living under a bridge.

15:24.916 --> 15:27.083
Elvira, it's good you came to me.

15:28.333 --> 15:29.708
Let's just hope

15:30.458 --> 15:33.125
no one found the girl's body this morning.

15:38.125 --> 15:39.333
-Mom, I--
-No!

15:40.541 --> 15:42.750
My son is not going to jail.
That's for sure.

15:42.833 --> 15:44.125
Over my dead body.

15:44.208 --> 15:47.750
Elvira, calm down. I know what I'm doing.

15:48.375 --> 15:51.375
Do you think it's the first time
a client of mine is in trouble?

15:52.750 --> 15:54.833
I guess I have to thank you, for once.

15:56.166 --> 15:58.416
Okay. Go now, I'll keep you posted.

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
Sandro. Tomorrow, at the premiere,

16:03.708 --> 16:06.666
I want you all cheerful and smiling, okay?

16:09.250 --> 16:10.250
Of course.

16:11.166 --> 16:12.708
I'm Sandro Ralli, after all.

16:38.333 --> 16:39.750
Minnella, my dear.

16:40.625 --> 16:42.583
Today you are my only hope.

16:50.708 --> 16:53.291
Maybe we should have called the driver.

16:53.375 --> 16:55.875
Why? You don't like your mom's driving?

17:00.000 --> 17:01.458
So where am I going?

17:02.208 --> 17:03.708
Where should I take you, Nora?

17:05.083 --> 17:07.583
You can leave me wherever.
I'll walk from there.

17:07.666 --> 17:09.375
Why walk? We have a car!

17:09.458 --> 17:12.041
-No, really. I'll take a walk.
-Nora is coming with us.

17:12.625 --> 17:14.333
So we can finish studying.

17:19.500 --> 17:21.750
Quiet on the set!

17:21.833 --> 17:23.166
And action!

17:24.625 --> 17:25.958
Go! Go on!

17:26.041 --> 17:28.625
Keep going! Keep up the pace!

17:28.708 --> 17:31.083
Go!

17:31.166 --> 17:32.166
Cut!

17:35.666 --> 17:36.500
Well?

17:43.875 --> 17:45.291
There's a dead body here.

17:45.375 --> 17:47.000
Make it disappear.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.500
Don't screw up.

17:52.583 --> 17:53.583
Nora, don't go.

17:53.666 --> 17:56.625
Rosa, please.
You got everything you wanted today.

17:56.708 --> 17:59.125
But why? How can you not want
to know everything?

17:59.208 --> 18:01.500
-I really don't get it.
-Get what?

18:02.333 --> 18:05.791
That, in the best-case scenario,
my mom was a loon who kidnapped kids?

18:05.875 --> 18:09.500
I can't even ask her for an explanation.
But there has to be one.

18:09.583 --> 18:11.500
I saw how you were looking at Mom.

18:11.583 --> 18:14.291
You must think I'm one of those dolls
you keep in the attic.

18:14.375 --> 18:16.541
Just leave me alone! Fuck!

18:19.250 --> 18:23.250
What? Your little sister
isn't how you imagined her to be?

18:23.333 --> 18:24.375
I'm sorry.

18:29.625 --> 18:30.625
Nora.

18:35.875 --> 18:37.875
Hey. Look.

18:43.166 --> 18:44.416
-Hi.
-Hi.

18:44.916 --> 18:46.625
-What are you doing here?
-Leaving.

18:46.708 --> 18:49.000
No! I miss you already.

18:49.083 --> 18:50.583
Stop it.

18:50.666 --> 18:52.166
Wait. This concerns you too.

18:52.250 --> 18:53.333
What happened?

18:53.416 --> 18:54.583
Nothing. Simone went mad.

18:55.166 --> 18:57.625
He's convinced
that Sandro Ralli is a murderer.

18:57.708 --> 18:59.375
Oh, I'm convinced? Okay.

19:02.333 --> 19:03.333
Look at these.

20:42.291 --> 20:43.291
She was there.

20:45.250 --> 20:46.500
-Where?
-Over there.

20:49.833 --> 20:50.666
Hello?

20:50.750 --> 20:52.041
Can I speak to Ettore?

20:52.125 --> 20:54.000
Excuse me, it's for me.

20:57.375 --> 20:58.416
We're coming.

21:02.833 --> 21:04.583
Guys, there's nothing here.

21:04.666 --> 21:06.833
Somebody had too much tequila last night.

21:06.916 --> 21:09.083
No, Giggi. She screamed.
Stop making jokes.

21:09.166 --> 21:10.791
You heard her too.

21:10.875 --> 21:13.166
Yes, but it wasn't really a scream.

21:13.250 --> 21:14.541
What do you mean?

21:14.625 --> 21:15.458
There. See?

21:15.541 --> 21:18.916
Anyway, Simone, sometimes women
scream for pleasure too. Right?

21:19.000 --> 21:20.625
-You idiot.
-You're a jerk.

21:20.708 --> 21:23.166
-Giggi, you'd better shut up.
-What did I say?

21:23.750 --> 21:25.625
I say we go to the police,
just to be safe.

21:25.708 --> 21:27.958
No. I say we go to the newspaper,
with my photos.

21:28.041 --> 21:29.125
Again with the paper?

21:29.208 --> 21:31.875
-You can't see anything!
-Because you have no imagination!

21:31.958 --> 21:34.291
You could write a story,
prompt an investigation.

21:34.375 --> 21:35.958
I'm a political journalist.

21:36.041 --> 21:38.041
But this is political, Matteo.

21:38.125 --> 21:41.541
How much is that poor girl's life worth?
And how much is Sandro Ralli worth?

21:41.625 --> 21:44.958
If we don't create a scandal, no one
will know what happened to Gioia!

21:45.041 --> 21:46.083
Boom!

21:46.166 --> 21:48.625
He's right.
We don't all have the same price tag.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.416
We're so lucky! Lucky for us,

21:52.500 --> 21:55.416
the carny is giving us a lesson
in politics. We were worried!

21:55.500 --> 21:58.375
Tell me, how much is the reward
for finding your sister?

21:58.458 --> 22:01.000
You should know.
That's why you're playing Rosa.

22:01.083 --> 22:02.916
-Enough.
-And you're playing him too.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.041
You think I don't see right through you?

22:05.125 --> 22:07.125
You don't know a thing. Shut up!

22:07.208 --> 22:10.000
You shut up too! And you're about
to get your face rearranged.

22:11.000 --> 22:11.958
Enough!

22:12.041 --> 22:14.583
A girl might've been killed
and you want to argue?

22:14.666 --> 22:18.458
We're not in the garden at the villa
and we're not at the carnival!

22:18.541 --> 22:20.833
You know what? None of this is my problem.

22:20.916 --> 22:23.875
-I'm going back to the carnival.
-Nora, wait! I'll come with you.

22:23.958 --> 22:26.041
-Let her go.
-You're giving me orders now?

22:26.125 --> 22:27.500
Wait, I'll go.

22:27.583 --> 22:29.041
Go ahead, Casanova. Go!

22:29.583 --> 22:31.125
Get to work! Go!

22:31.625 --> 22:33.083
That's just perfect!

22:34.458 --> 22:35.666
Nora!

22:35.750 --> 22:37.125
Nora, wait!

22:39.500 --> 22:41.625
Hey, why are you acting like this?

22:42.250 --> 22:43.500
What did Rosa tell you?

22:43.583 --> 22:46.000
Nothing. She's a spoiled little girl.

22:46.625 --> 22:50.375
No, she's not. Come on.
Rosa's smart, she's sensitive.

22:50.458 --> 22:51.708
And she's sincere.

22:53.333 --> 22:55.666
-Hey, will you stop?
-Do you know what I did today?

22:55.750 --> 22:59.083
I went shopping with my mother!
With my mother!

23:00.708 --> 23:03.208
It feels like a nightmare.
I just want to wake up.

23:03.291 --> 23:06.833
Is there anyone who can help you
understand how things happened?

23:06.916 --> 23:09.958
Only my grandmother, but she won't.

23:10.041 --> 23:12.583
Are you sure?
Because you're a pretty tough girl.

23:12.666 --> 23:14.625
Exactly. I get it from her.

23:14.708 --> 23:17.666
But I'm sure you can make her see reason.

23:18.458 --> 23:19.791
You don't know her.

23:20.458 --> 23:22.000
But I know you.

23:23.541 --> 23:24.833
I don't think so.

23:45.333 --> 23:46.750
What are we doing, Miranda?

23:46.833 --> 23:48.416
It's an old trick.

23:48.500 --> 23:53.250
When business is slow,
you pretend you have a client.

23:53.333 --> 23:55.333
At least you're making yourself useful.

23:57.333 --> 23:59.125
-Well?
-What?

23:59.208 --> 24:01.666
What did the Grotta cousins want
on the phone?

24:01.750 --> 24:04.125
You're the fortune teller. You tell me.

24:04.708 --> 24:06.916
I've known those two
since they were babies.

24:09.750 --> 24:10.916
They're criminals.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.083
Yeah, sure.

24:15.291 --> 24:17.125
And you're just a poor idiot.

24:22.541 --> 24:23.833
They will fool you.

24:25.750 --> 24:27.750
That's what the cards say,

24:27.833 --> 24:30.041
and those dimwit eyes of yours.

24:33.458 --> 24:35.000
Why don't you mind your business?

24:35.083 --> 24:36.916
-May we come in?
-In two minutes.

24:37.000 --> 24:37.833
This place

24:38.416 --> 24:39.541
is my business.

24:40.250 --> 24:41.791
-And my daughter's.
-Yeah.

24:42.458 --> 24:43.791
And Antonio's.

24:43.875 --> 24:46.416
They all put their heart
and soul into this place.

24:47.916 --> 24:49.375
-Ettore.
-What?

24:51.041 --> 24:52.916
We're talking about the future here.

24:54.291 --> 24:56.541
And you're one to never look ahead.

24:57.541 --> 24:59.291
That's why you have to be careful.

25:00.375 --> 25:03.083
The Grottas can fool you.

25:10.125 --> 25:12.250
Why don't you come eat something with us?

25:13.916 --> 25:14.750
No.

25:15.583 --> 25:16.666
I don't feel like it.

25:16.750 --> 25:18.000
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

25:18.916 --> 25:19.916
Okay.

25:28.541 --> 25:30.000
Nora. There you are.

25:31.500 --> 25:32.708
Look what I've got.

25:36.166 --> 25:38.625
-You've put some effort into it.
-Yes. Want some?

25:42.166 --> 25:43.875
You didn't say you'd be out tonight.

25:43.958 --> 25:46.875
Didn't you tell me
I can do whatever I want?

25:50.875 --> 25:52.541
With that kid again?

25:53.125 --> 25:55.375
The rich dandy Miranda doesn't like?

25:58.166 --> 26:00.041
Look what I've got for you.

26:01.250 --> 26:02.083
Huh?

26:03.875 --> 26:05.708
It's wonderful, but…

26:07.750 --> 26:08.916
Where did you get it?

26:10.250 --> 26:12.208
I found it in a garbage can.

26:19.250 --> 26:20.375
Your uncle Ettore…

26:22.416 --> 26:24.083
is scheming with the Grottas.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.000
No way!

26:31.333 --> 26:34.041
You and I trust the people we love
a bit too much.

26:34.125 --> 26:36.041
It's inevitable, sweetheart.

26:38.125 --> 26:41.333
You can't really love someone
you don't trust.

26:42.333 --> 26:43.250
No.

26:47.250 --> 26:50.083
-No. Not a word here.
-Are you sure?

26:50.166 --> 26:51.541
What are they doing?

26:51.625 --> 26:53.625
-No dead bodies.
-Nothing at all?

26:54.625 --> 26:57.541
Since when do you care
about the local news?

26:58.541 --> 27:01.125
No. I was just looking

27:01.208 --> 27:03.375
for information
on tonight's premiere, Mom.

27:03.458 --> 27:05.000
-Are you excited, honey?
-Very.

27:05.083 --> 27:08.166
Of course! Not everyone
gets to hang out with Sandro Ralli.

27:09.541 --> 27:13.583
I'm going to study,
or else I'll fail the exam again.

27:13.666 --> 27:15.708
Sounds like a great idea.

27:16.416 --> 27:18.333
-Good job, darling.
-Thanks, Daddy.

27:19.041 --> 27:19.875
Hey.

27:21.958 --> 27:23.791
-Come.
-Are you going to the Baldis'?

27:23.875 --> 27:25.583
-No.
-How come?

27:27.083 --> 27:28.750
I don't know. It's complicated.

27:28.833 --> 27:32.250
I thought you and Matteo had made up.
I saw you together last night.

27:33.291 --> 27:34.791
What do you think of Nora?

27:35.708 --> 27:37.291
If you like her, my darling…

27:38.791 --> 27:40.708
Are you plotting behind my back?

27:41.291 --> 27:43.750
-You have your little secrets, huh?
-What secrets?

27:44.250 --> 27:45.250
Bye, my love.

27:46.083 --> 27:48.416
Oh, we're having dinner
at the Baldis' tonight.

27:49.083 --> 27:49.916
What?

27:52.041 --> 27:54.083
-I called your brother.
-No, Miss.

27:54.166 --> 27:55.625
I want to speak with the editor.

27:56.208 --> 27:58.541
-I'm sorry, but--
-Are you trying to get me fired?

27:58.625 --> 28:00.375
If anything, I'll get you a promotion.

28:02.750 --> 28:05.958
I appreciate a bit of imagination,
but I know Ralli pretty well.

28:06.500 --> 28:08.750
He's a great kid,
and you can't see anything here.

28:08.833 --> 28:09.875
-Exactly.
-No, sorry.

28:09.958 --> 28:11.791
If you'd let me use your darkroom,

28:11.875 --> 28:14.666
I could enlarge the photos,
try and make the image clearer.

28:15.541 --> 28:17.083
Ten minutes, that's it.

28:17.958 --> 28:20.625
I started out
as a photojournalist, you know?

28:20.708 --> 28:23.666
I've got a little more experience
than you. Trust me.

28:24.166 --> 28:25.791
Even when it comes to women.

28:26.458 --> 28:29.625
No young lady would resist Sandro.

28:36.583 --> 28:38.166
Why the long faces?

28:38.666 --> 28:40.750
We should all be happy for Miss Gioia,

28:40.833 --> 28:43.416
who, I'm sure, is doing great.

28:43.500 --> 28:47.708
And for yourselves too. Because if Ralli
was a killer, you'd be in real trouble.

28:48.625 --> 28:49.625
Us? Why?

28:50.208 --> 28:53.250
Powerful people
know how to protect themselves.

28:53.916 --> 28:56.166
Even from us. You tell him, Matteo.

29:05.291 --> 29:08.500
Okay, so, what do you need that land for?

29:08.583 --> 29:10.000
That's a lot of money.

29:10.083 --> 29:12.291
-Don't you know, cousin?
-No, what?

29:12.375 --> 29:14.666
Discretion these days
is worth its weight in gold.

29:35.250 --> 29:36.250
Do you like it?

29:36.791 --> 29:37.791
It's nice.

29:38.458 --> 29:41.000
It looks a bit less like a van
and more like a house.

29:43.875 --> 29:45.166
There you go!

29:47.625 --> 29:48.708
You're blushing, Tina.

29:50.375 --> 29:51.583
It's nothing.

29:54.333 --> 29:55.708
Is everything all right?

29:57.083 --> 29:58.166
Everything's fine.

29:58.666 --> 29:59.500
Listen.

30:00.500 --> 30:02.916
If you need anything,
don't hesitate to ask.

30:04.541 --> 30:05.541
Like I said…

30:09.375 --> 30:10.625
we're family here.

30:21.791 --> 30:23.958
I told you it was all just in your head.

30:24.833 --> 30:27.791
Maybe. But can I come with you
to the premiere?

30:27.875 --> 30:29.791
No. I'm sorry, Simone.

30:29.875 --> 30:32.500
I'd rather cash in on the invitation
and take a girl.

30:32.583 --> 30:34.416
A girl? What girl?

30:35.000 --> 30:37.291
I don't know yet. I'm working on it.

30:37.375 --> 30:40.083
Come on. It's in an hour.
Who are you going to find?

30:40.166 --> 30:42.791
What a nightmare, Simone! Just this once.

30:43.875 --> 30:46.958
Let's go, come on.
I really want to look him in the eyes.

30:47.041 --> 30:49.041
Let's go and look him in the eyes.

30:49.125 --> 30:50.916
-Wait.
-What?

30:54.250 --> 30:55.166
Matteo?

30:55.250 --> 30:57.875
Huh? No, I'll stay here a bit longer.

30:57.958 --> 30:59.250
By yourself?

31:00.041 --> 31:00.875
Yes.

31:01.458 --> 31:03.000
Maybe she'll come down.

31:03.083 --> 31:04.500
Yeah, right!

31:04.583 --> 31:05.791
You're so mean!

31:28.916 --> 31:30.083
Look.

31:31.916 --> 31:33.208
It's all set, then.

31:33.708 --> 31:37.625
The first floor of my new building
will be entirely dedicated

31:37.708 --> 31:39.291
to your shelter for bums

31:39.375 --> 31:41.375
coming from the countryside.

31:44.166 --> 31:46.583
What can we say? Thank you.

31:46.666 --> 31:49.583
-The Party will be thrilled.
-And the bums too.

31:49.666 --> 31:50.916
Not to mention incredulous.

31:51.000 --> 31:54.666
Are you kidding, Lando? It's charity.
It's important to me.

31:55.166 --> 31:57.083
Plus, I'll also save on taxes.

31:57.166 --> 31:58.500
Everyone's happy.

31:58.583 --> 31:59.958
I'm proud of you, my love.

32:02.375 --> 32:05.250
So, everything's been sorted out already.

32:06.333 --> 32:08.333
And we're still on the appetizers.

32:10.875 --> 32:12.375
May I use the toilet?

32:13.583 --> 32:15.583
-It's down the hall.
-The maid will show you.

32:15.666 --> 32:17.375
No. I've got it.

32:57.125 --> 32:58.708
God damn it!

33:00.083 --> 33:01.583
Damn it.

33:07.750 --> 33:09.208
That's great news, right?

33:10.333 --> 33:12.375
My husband always manages
to surprise me.

33:12.458 --> 33:13.416
Good for you.

33:13.500 --> 33:16.208
Do you know what he did when he proposed?

33:17.333 --> 33:19.916
He organized a treasure hunt
across the whole city.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.708
And this ring, look, this one…

33:22.833 --> 33:24.208
Guess where it was?

33:25.041 --> 33:25.875
Where was it?

33:25.958 --> 33:28.541
In the Trevi Fountain,
among all those coins!

33:30.208 --> 33:32.208
That must've taken some guts.

33:32.291 --> 33:34.750
He took a big risk,
leaving such a nice rock

33:34.833 --> 33:37.625
just floating like that in the water.

33:37.708 --> 33:39.083
Well, yes.

33:39.166 --> 33:40.458
But that's how he is.

33:41.083 --> 33:43.375
Everything is a game to him.

33:47.000 --> 33:48.958
-Shall we play too?
-Huh?

34:06.000 --> 34:08.250
I needed to clear my head.

34:09.833 --> 34:10.875
I did that

34:11.500 --> 34:12.958
and I wanted to apologize.

34:15.833 --> 34:16.916
You don't have to.

34:19.000 --> 34:20.541
I said you put me on a pedestal,

34:21.208 --> 34:23.208
but, actually, I did that too.

34:23.291 --> 34:25.250
Both with you and with Adele.

34:25.333 --> 34:26.916
What's Adele got to do with this?

34:27.833 --> 34:30.625
Well, she was always
kind of my courtly love.

34:33.541 --> 34:35.416
I had this image of her.

34:39.375 --> 34:40.666
The thing is, Matteo,

34:42.500 --> 34:45.666
that we want reality
to be the way we dream of it.

34:46.375 --> 34:48.708
But it's more complicated than that.

34:50.333 --> 34:51.750
We have to grow up.

34:52.708 --> 34:54.500
We don't have any choice.

35:09.458 --> 35:12.125
So what do we do now?

35:12.208 --> 35:14.875
We'll grow up together.

35:16.125 --> 35:18.250
One step at a time.

35:19.375 --> 35:21.083
Together, one step at a time.

35:28.791 --> 35:31.416
-I'd ask you to come inside, but--
-No.

35:31.500 --> 35:34.125
No. I don't want to see your dad
after that dinner.

35:34.750 --> 35:36.916
I'll get changed and we'll go to my place.

35:38.375 --> 35:40.208
My parents will already be asleep.

35:40.291 --> 35:41.208
Okay.

35:51.166 --> 35:52.000
Sandro!

35:52.083 --> 35:54.125
-A picture, please!
-Sandro, a picture!

35:54.208 --> 35:55.833
You girls, too, give us a smile.

35:55.916 --> 35:58.208
A full theater for the premiere

35:58.291 --> 36:01.208
of the sure-to-be-announced new success

36:01.291 --> 36:04.125
of our all-Italian star, Sandro Ralli.

36:04.208 --> 36:06.458
Here he comes, the handsome Sandro Ralli,

36:06.541 --> 36:09.791
surrounded by the beautiful women
who had the honor of dancing with him.

36:09.875 --> 36:12.166
A picture, girls. One more!

36:12.250 --> 36:14.208
Go ahead. Take a picture.

36:15.000 --> 36:16.416
That's it. Fantastic.

36:16.500 --> 36:18.500
-Thank you.
-Time to celebrate.

36:18.583 --> 36:19.625
Oh, yeah.

36:23.500 --> 36:25.125
Okay. That's enough. Thank you.

36:25.208 --> 36:26.666
Doesn't he seem a bit tense?

36:27.291 --> 36:29.250
It's his premiere. He must be nervous.

36:29.916 --> 36:31.666
Anyway, I brought you here,

36:31.750 --> 36:34.208
but I won't let you
ruin this night for me.

36:34.291 --> 36:37.291
Ruin? No way!
Let's go and congratulate him.

36:37.375 --> 36:39.875
No, we're not going to congratulate him.

36:39.958 --> 36:43.125
He likes me, I don't want him
to change his mind because of you.

36:43.208 --> 36:44.791
Tonight is just about fun.

36:44.875 --> 36:45.833
Watch me.

36:52.541 --> 36:53.666
Sorry.

36:53.750 --> 36:55.625
Enchanté, milady.

36:55.708 --> 36:57.958
Giggi Gabrielli, the host of Musicherò.

36:58.916 --> 37:00.208
I'm engaged.

37:00.958 --> 37:02.791
My condolences. Sorry to hear that.

37:02.875 --> 37:04.916
You too? It's carnage these days.

37:06.666 --> 37:08.333
-Smile.
-What did I tell you?

37:08.416 --> 37:10.875
-Last picture. Sandro, look here.
-Enough.

37:11.916 --> 37:14.041
Enough. No more photos, please.

37:14.875 --> 37:16.916
Let's enjoy this beautiful night.

37:19.333 --> 37:20.541
Good evening.

37:24.208 --> 37:25.208
What is it?

37:25.291 --> 37:27.208
-I know this one!
-No, I've got it.

37:27.291 --> 37:29.250
-It's Lassie Come Home!
-No!

37:29.333 --> 37:32.208
It's not Lassie, Doriana!
It's a horse, not a dog!

37:32.291 --> 37:34.000
It's not a horse! It's a dog!

37:34.083 --> 37:35.750
A big, big, big dog!

37:35.833 --> 37:38.000
-Yeah!
-What big dog? It's a horse. Ben Hur?

37:38.083 --> 37:40.375
No! It's Shane!

37:40.458 --> 37:42.708
-No.
-Stagecoach!

37:43.958 --> 37:45.166
Time's up!

37:46.166 --> 37:48.208
-Time's up!
-What was it?

37:48.291 --> 37:50.708
-You almost had it.
-With Lassie Come Home?

37:50.791 --> 37:52.708
-No.
-Is that it?

37:52.791 --> 37:54.041
The Girl of the West.

37:54.125 --> 37:55.750
Of course! I'm such an idiot!

37:55.833 --> 37:58.625
What the heck is The Girl of the West?
Some art house film?

37:58.708 --> 38:01.750
It's not a film.
It's one of Puccini's late operas.

38:01.833 --> 38:03.375
-Whose opera?
-Puccini.

38:03.458 --> 38:05.416
-I slept through it for sure!
-What a drag!

38:07.041 --> 38:09.750
Tell me something,
why were you punching? I mean--

38:09.833 --> 38:12.833
-Those were hooves.
-Give me a break!

38:12.916 --> 38:15.666
Honey, Lando is such a communist

38:15.750 --> 38:18.041
that he even makes fists to play a horse!

38:18.125 --> 38:19.375
Communist!

38:19.458 --> 38:20.416
Mommy?

38:22.958 --> 38:24.791
-Hi.
-Darling.

38:24.875 --> 38:26.708
We were just playing.

38:27.291 --> 38:30.041
Sorry, we didn't know
you were having a get-together.

38:30.125 --> 38:32.750
We don't mind at all if you guys

38:32.833 --> 38:36.000
want to go to the kitchen
and make yourselves something to eat.

38:36.083 --> 38:37.250
Yes. Go ahead.

38:37.333 --> 38:41.708
We'll move to the other room, so you can
carry on doing what you were doing.

38:41.791 --> 38:44.458
In the kitchen though! Right, Doriana?

38:44.958 --> 38:46.875
Or else we'll get a Democrat grandkid!

38:52.000 --> 38:54.458
If you're tired, you can go. I'll stay.

38:54.541 --> 38:56.916
No, why? I'm here now.

38:58.500 --> 38:59.500
What a drag!

39:00.208 --> 39:01.458
You're always cranky.

39:01.541 --> 39:03.791
You talk nonsense,
you go out with that guy.

39:05.375 --> 39:07.208
And since when do you care about money?

39:07.291 --> 39:09.416
I don't care about the money.

39:10.250 --> 39:12.416
-That's not the problem.
-What is it, then?

39:13.208 --> 39:14.625
You don't want to be free?

39:15.333 --> 39:18.541
-Don't talk about things you don't know.
-You're shutting me out.

39:23.833 --> 39:26.166
You want to go sunbathe
at the river tomorrow?

39:27.625 --> 39:29.250
-Maybe.
-Come on!

39:30.833 --> 39:34.416
I won't see him again, anyway.
I wasted my time with those people.

39:36.458 --> 39:37.500
What happened?

39:38.291 --> 39:41.166
Stop asking questions,
or I'll beat you up!

39:53.250 --> 39:54.708
I'm going for a ride.

41:33.750 --> 41:34.791
Sandro?

41:36.375 --> 41:37.458
Who is it?

41:45.625 --> 41:47.583
I've sacrificed everything.

41:48.375 --> 41:49.875
For who, Sandro?

41:53.250 --> 41:55.333
For my fans, of course.

41:57.500 --> 42:00.416
For your fans. Hey! Are you crazy?

42:00.916 --> 42:02.958
Do you remember me?

42:03.041 --> 42:05.666
Giggi Gabrielli. We have the same agent.

42:05.750 --> 42:07.291
We met, you combed my hair.

42:07.375 --> 42:09.083
-Of course.
-Ouch.

42:10.208 --> 42:11.291
Take this, Giggi.

42:11.375 --> 42:13.541
No, that's enough.
It's time to drink water.

42:13.625 --> 42:16.666
No, it's time for you to shut up.
You talk too much.

42:16.750 --> 42:19.791
Why are you in a bad mood, Sandro?
It's a beautiful night.

42:22.166 --> 42:24.125
They just won't go away.

42:28.000 --> 42:29.666
Those little eyes.

42:31.125 --> 42:32.583
Those little eyes.

42:33.500 --> 42:34.958
They won't go away.

42:36.833 --> 42:39.083
I keep seeing them, you know?

42:41.250 --> 42:42.625
What are you talking about?

42:51.750 --> 42:54.291
I'm talking about my fans, of course.

42:54.375 --> 42:56.125
Oh, you're talking about your fans.

42:56.208 --> 42:58.583
-They always stare.
-You don't look great, Sandro.

42:58.666 --> 43:01.250
-I'll slap you in the face!
-Slap me? Why?

43:02.041 --> 43:05.125
-Wait. What were you saying?
-Get the fuck out of my way.

46:15.541 --> 46:18.333
Tell me what happened,
or I'll go talk to Dad.

46:20.166 --> 46:21.625
I'll wake him up right now.

46:22.458 --> 46:24.083
Are you threatening me?

46:24.166 --> 46:25.958
I thought you loved me.

46:27.291 --> 46:29.166
I can't trust you anymore,

46:29.250 --> 46:31.125
so I can't love you either.

46:41.791 --> 46:43.208
You win, my dear.

46:45.666 --> 46:47.833
But you're making me open up an old wound

46:47.916 --> 46:49.666
and pour a whole bag of salt on it.

46:52.250 --> 46:53.750
I'll tell you what happened.

46:55.000 --> 46:56.875
But don't you dare judge us.

47:15.833 --> 47:18.833
