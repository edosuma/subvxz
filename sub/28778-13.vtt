WEBVTT

00:00.820 --> 00:02.994
Previously on Blood & Treasure...

00:03.000 --> 00:04.601
We've known all along

00:04.617 --> 00:07.050
that Farouk was planning
to use Antony and Cleopatra

00:07.056 --> 00:08.464
somehow in an attack.

00:08.470 --> 00:09.904
His crew is still out there,

00:09.910 --> 00:11.166
and they have a bioweapon.

00:11.172 --> 00:12.306
Go ahead, Simon.

00:12.312 --> 00:14.440
Antony and Cleopatra are
being held in a vault

00:14.446 --> 00:16.347
in the Bank Saint-Laurent in Paris.

00:16.353 --> 00:17.555
We're building a replica

00:17.561 --> 00:19.272
of the tomb in a brand-new wing

00:19.278 --> 00:21.237
in my museum in Egypt.

00:21.243 --> 00:23.579
What better way to
unveil her to the world.

00:23.585 --> 00:26.454
Jay, did you know that you
were Karim Farouk's father?

00:26.460 --> 00:27.794
I've known for years.

00:27.800 --> 00:30.034
I don't care that you fathered someone

00:30.040 --> 00:31.387
who became a terrorist.

00:31.393 --> 00:33.227
You couldn't help what he would become.

00:33.233 --> 00:35.391
That's not how the
world would see it, Ana.

00:35.458 --> 00:38.445
Everything I've ever worked for
would be destroyed forever.

00:40.025 --> 00:41.787
Maybe you're the last person

00:41.793 --> 00:43.766
who has to die in the name of

00:43.772 --> 00:45.573
Karim Farouk.

01:06.618 --> 01:08.824
I blame myself.

01:10.465 --> 01:11.983
Farouk or d...

01:12.916 --> 01:15.517
Somebody who worked for him...

01:16.285 --> 01:17.966
Must have intended the poison for me.

01:17.972 --> 01:19.492
Unfortunately for Ana, they put it

01:19.498 --> 01:21.012
in the wine and not the bourbon.

01:21.018 --> 01:23.293
Jay, you need to put the unveiling

01:23.299 --> 01:25.033
of Antony and Cleopatra on hold

01:25.039 --> 01:26.811
until Farouk's crew is finally caught.

01:26.817 --> 01:28.888
I agree. I've already given the order.

01:29.206 --> 01:31.107
So the poison was in the wine?

01:31.113 --> 01:33.589
Why? What are you thinking?

01:33.595 --> 01:35.557
Farouk poisoned two other people.

01:35.563 --> 01:38.666
But the other two instances
were a contact poison.

01:38.672 --> 01:41.400
Easier to target, less chance
of a mistake like this.

01:41.406 --> 01:42.773
Why change it up now?

01:57.097 --> 01:59.666
Hey, guys, I got to talk to you about...

02:00.594 --> 02:01.953
What are you doing?

02:01.959 --> 02:03.860
Dr. Castillo...

02:04.836 --> 02:06.522
She's dead.

02:10.269 --> 02:11.657
How?

02:12.327 --> 02:14.962
Supposedly, poisoned wine.

02:15.154 --> 02:17.389
They think Farouk's crew is behind it.

02:17.408 --> 02:18.788
What do you mean "supposedly"?

02:18.794 --> 02:20.496
I have my doubts, but
until we know more,

02:20.502 --> 02:22.295
we need to be careful.

02:25.459 --> 02:28.862
Danny, I actually do know more.

02:29.753 --> 02:33.957
I talked to a friend of mine
who's an imam in Egypt.

02:33.963 --> 02:37.199
He sent me a document
from Zara Farouk's mosque.

02:37.205 --> 02:39.023
It's from a baby's Sebou.

02:40.057 --> 02:42.160
Egyptian birth custom,
like a baby shower

02:42.166 --> 02:44.067
seven days after the child is born.

02:44.073 --> 02:45.340
What did it say?

02:45.346 --> 02:48.148
It listed the name of the baby's father.

02:49.807 --> 02:51.374
Jacob Reece.

02:52.959 --> 02:54.826
Oh, my God.

02:54.832 --> 02:57.413
What-what-what does this
have to do with Castillo?

02:57.481 --> 03:00.377
Castillo signed for
the package. She opened it.

03:01.537 --> 03:05.000
She found out Reece's secret
and went right to him.

03:11.724 --> 03:12.867
Gwen.

03:12.873 --> 03:14.819
Danny, I'm sending you
and Lexi something.

03:14.825 --> 03:16.962
Hold on. Let me put you on speaker.

03:17.173 --> 03:19.124
So, I went through Ghazal's hard drive

03:19.130 --> 03:20.431
and I found a number of e-mails

03:20.437 --> 03:22.300
from a private account to Ghazal,

03:22.306 --> 03:25.008
from Yates, Reece's head of security.

03:25.075 --> 03:27.295
And they're not explicit,
but it's pretty clear

03:27.301 --> 03:28.912
that they are referring to Farouk.

03:28.979 --> 03:30.280
How is that clear?

03:30.471 --> 03:31.972
Well, they're using chess terms.

03:31.978 --> 03:33.878
Look at the first one,
from the first day

03:33.884 --> 03:35.102
of the Farouk operation,

03:35.108 --> 03:37.220
when you were still working the case.

03:37.509 --> 03:41.302
"In current game, my king
is going to be captured.

03:41.308 --> 03:42.675
"How should I proceed?"

03:42.681 --> 03:43.916
Yates...

03:43.922 --> 03:45.823
"Use the bishop to block."

03:45.829 --> 03:48.259
Ghazal is the bishop
and Farouk is the king.

03:48.265 --> 03:50.929
 Ghazal's next e-mail:
"King escaped capture.

03:50.935 --> 03:52.201
"Good advice."

03:53.156 --> 03:55.600
When we were trailing
Farouk, and he veered off

03:55.606 --> 03:58.116
towards the border to
avoid getting captured...

03:58.776 --> 04:00.610
Ghazal warned him off.

04:01.484 --> 04:03.677
Ghazal was Reece's mole.

04:03.863 --> 04:05.233
Not Farouk's.

04:05.387 --> 04:07.599
Going through Ghazal's finances,

04:07.605 --> 04:09.188
it seems like he received a pretty

04:09.194 --> 04:10.584
hefty payment the next day.

04:10.590 --> 04:12.455
And the bank that issued it,

04:12.461 --> 04:15.613
it's the same bank that issued
the check to Zara Farouk.

04:15.619 --> 04:18.461
Reece wanted him killed.

04:19.135 --> 04:20.725
But it was a capture mission.

04:20.731 --> 04:22.370
He couldn't risk Farouk talking.

04:22.376 --> 04:23.762
That bastard.

04:23.768 --> 04:25.797
He was willing to keep
a terrorist on the loose

04:25.803 --> 04:28.871
rather than take the chance
of his secret being exposed.

04:29.001 --> 04:30.702
Wait, when we tracked

04:30.708 --> 04:32.508
Farouk to the free port in Geneva,

04:32.576 --> 04:35.378
Reece gave me specific
instructions to alert

04:35.384 --> 04:39.120
only him when we found
Farouk, and he'd handle it.

04:42.777 --> 04:45.010
It was never about saving Castillo.

04:46.269 --> 04:49.192
He's been using me since day one.

04:51.161 --> 04:53.594
And then he murdered
Castillo to keep his secret.

04:56.455 --> 04:59.353
- Danny!
- Is everyone okay?

05:04.857 --> 05:06.377
I'll go talk to him.

05:06.383 --> 05:07.943
Lexi, wait.

05:08.972 --> 05:11.171
I found something else
in Ghazal's e-mails.

05:11.177 --> 05:13.244
Great, just what he needs.

05:13.250 --> 05:15.284
It actually concerns you as well.

05:35.539 --> 05:37.573
Thought I broke it.

05:37.641 --> 05:39.042
Here.

05:44.515 --> 05:46.343
There's something else,

05:46.953 --> 05:49.380
but before I tell you,
I need you to promise me

05:49.386 --> 05:51.684
you won't throw yourself off this ledge.

05:51.690 --> 05:53.890
How much worse can it get?

05:57.810 --> 05:59.541
Do you remember, two years ago,

05:59.547 --> 06:01.091
after Farouk went on the run,

06:01.097 --> 06:02.497
and all the antiquities he looted

06:02.503 --> 06:03.995
were taken by the Americans?

06:04.251 --> 06:05.893
My father was then brought in to

06:05.899 --> 06:07.746
help inventory everything. Well...

06:08.390 --> 06:10.457
Apparently he found a box of paperwork

06:10.463 --> 06:12.874
amongst Farouk's things...

06:13.204 --> 06:14.872
Including an official birth certificate

06:14.878 --> 06:17.447
listing Reece as the father.

06:17.514 --> 06:20.116
- What?
- My father called Ghazal to make sure

06:20.122 --> 06:22.847
it was all authentic. Ghazal
told him he would handle it.

06:22.853 --> 06:24.954
Took all the paperwork
and swore him to secrecy.

06:25.022 --> 06:27.590
That's what was in the office safe,

06:27.658 --> 06:30.293
in the file I stole for Fabi.

06:31.412 --> 06:34.097
Ghazal kept it as leverage on Reece.

06:34.103 --> 06:36.284
And told Reece he destroyed it.

06:38.166 --> 06:40.064
Reece had your father killed.

06:40.727 --> 06:43.039
He made it look like Farouk did it.

06:43.107 --> 06:45.341
Just like he did with Castillo.

06:48.182 --> 06:49.651
Hmm.

06:50.800 --> 06:52.653
We've really come a long way.

06:54.962 --> 06:56.380
How's that?

06:56.386 --> 06:59.722
I almost broke my hand
punching a wall...

07:00.556 --> 07:03.691
And you just found out Reece
murdered your father, and...

07:04.781 --> 07:07.897
Your first instinct
was to come up here...

07:07.965 --> 07:10.423
Not race out there and
put a bullet in him.

07:10.429 --> 07:13.570
Well... it was my first instinct.

07:14.427 --> 07:16.228
But now I've got a Danny in my head,

07:16.234 --> 07:18.474
so here I am trying to figure out...

07:19.614 --> 07:21.144
What to do.

07:21.211 --> 07:23.557
I am so sorry, Lexi.

07:24.263 --> 07:26.566
I promise you we're gonna
get justice for your father.

07:26.572 --> 07:29.780
Danny... everybody who
knows Reece's secret is dead

07:29.786 --> 07:33.225
except us, and we can't prove a thing.

07:33.231 --> 07:35.305
Maybe, maybe not.

07:35.592 --> 07:38.728
The file Fabi was
working on was destroyed.

07:38.734 --> 07:40.589
But if he shared his investigation

07:40.595 --> 07:42.663
with the Brotherhood,
they might have everything

07:42.669 --> 07:44.194
we need to take down Reece.

07:44.200 --> 07:46.882
Okay... I'll check in with
Alina and the Brotherhood.

07:46.888 --> 07:49.672
She's always been straight with me.

07:55.953 --> 07:58.422
You have a lot of nerve calling.

07:58.428 --> 08:00.073
I'm sure it was you that robbed the bank

08:00.079 --> 08:02.480
and gave Antony and
Cleopatra to the authorities.

08:02.486 --> 08:04.468
Well, we'll call it
even for the Brotherhood

08:04.474 --> 08:06.923
leaving us stranded on an
island in the Caribbean.

08:07.388 --> 08:09.356
I admit, it was a bold move.

08:09.770 --> 08:12.094
But part of me wishes
you were still on our side,

08:12.162 --> 08:14.034
helping us stop Farouk's crew.

08:14.040 --> 08:15.932
Wait... where are you?

08:15.999 --> 08:17.633
Outside Tanis, Egypt.

08:17.639 --> 08:19.347
One of Farouk's men popped up

08:19.353 --> 08:21.173
on our radar renting a truck.

08:21.179 --> 08:23.267
Our operatives followed
that truck to a small port,

08:23.273 --> 08:25.903
where it was loaded with
suspicious-looking crates.

08:25.909 --> 08:27.431
We believe those crates contain

08:27.437 --> 08:29.002
the biotoxin, and that they're

08:29.008 --> 08:30.341
probably targeting the unveiling

08:30.347 --> 08:32.414
of Antony and Cleopatra, which means

08:32.421 --> 08:34.424
hundreds of people are at risk.

08:34.429 --> 08:36.464
They're coming.

08:40.157 --> 08:42.758
I've got to go. I will
catch up with you later.

08:42.826 --> 08:45.094
Wait! Al...

10:15.747 --> 10:18.382
Travelers have been urged
to avoid the area of Tanis,

10:18.388 --> 10:21.590
targeted by a thwarted terrorist
bombing this afternoon.

10:21.596 --> 10:23.130
At least 20 people were killed in

10:23.136 --> 10:25.423
the ensuing firefight and explosion.

10:25.429 --> 10:27.430
This comes at a time when the country's

10:27.497 --> 10:30.066
- vital tourism industry...
- Gwen. What'd you find?

10:30.133 --> 10:32.675
A lot of bodies with Serapis medallions.

10:32.681 --> 10:34.904
There are no survivors.

10:34.910 --> 10:36.405
... more than three years

10:36.411 --> 10:38.779
- after two deadly terror attacks...
- I'm sorry, Lexi.

10:38.785 --> 10:41.157
The toxin's been destroyed,
and the Egyptians believe

10:41.163 --> 10:43.579
that this is the last of Farouk's men.

10:43.585 --> 10:45.910
The threat of the Farouk attack is over.

10:45.916 --> 10:47.249
A state of emergency

10:47.255 --> 10:48.689
has been in effect in Egypt since...

10:48.695 --> 10:50.929
They gave their lives to stop it.

10:58.528 --> 10:59.647
Gwen.

10:59.653 --> 11:02.460
They need to confirm it's the same toxin

11:02.466 --> 11:04.467
- Farouk weaponized in Russia.
- Yeah.

11:04.473 --> 11:06.197
I've already put a rush on the analysis

11:06.203 --> 11:08.537
and I'm gonna wait here
until I get confirmation.

11:09.967 --> 11:11.386
I got to go.

11:11.392 --> 11:13.350
I'll be in touch.

11:15.946 --> 11:17.279
Uh...

11:17.347 --> 11:20.383
Literally engraved invitations

11:20.919 --> 11:22.420
from Reece.

11:28.325 --> 11:30.793
The gala's back on.

11:30.861 --> 11:32.205
It's tomorrow night.

11:32.211 --> 11:34.989
Anyone else think it's a little
tacky to do it this soon?

11:34.995 --> 11:38.131
Tomorrow's the anniversary
of Cleopatra's death.

11:39.736 --> 11:41.971
The symbolism's too good
for Reece to miss it.

11:41.977 --> 11:44.641
He's been... working his
whole life for this moment.

11:46.076 --> 11:48.321
- And we're going.
- Next time I see that man,

11:48.327 --> 11:50.228
I plan for him to be all alone.

11:50.234 --> 11:53.036
He'll be distracted, celebrating.

11:53.712 --> 11:55.679
Thinking he's gotten
away with everything.

11:56.893 --> 11:59.739
We'll never have a better chance
to catch him off balance.

12:00.034 --> 12:01.274
Fine.

12:01.280 --> 12:03.972
But if this plan fails,
I can't promise I won't rip

12:03.978 --> 12:06.389
Reece's throat out with my bare hands.

12:06.787 --> 12:09.255
Then we better not fail.

12:11.765 --> 12:14.453
_

12:21.664 --> 12:23.098
Names?

12:23.258 --> 12:25.504
Daniel McNamara and Lexi Vaziri.

12:25.510 --> 12:26.895
Ah.

12:26.901 --> 12:29.393
Guests of Jacob Reece. Of course.

12:29.460 --> 12:31.928
Please step forward.

12:33.310 --> 12:35.244
- Hi, uh...
- Hi.

12:35.250 --> 12:37.184
- Father Charles Donnelly.
- Oh, yes.

12:37.190 --> 12:39.613
Thank you so much. Uh, I'm sorry.

12:39.619 --> 12:41.019
Father.

12:41.239 --> 12:43.206
Security needs to wand you.

12:44.778 --> 12:46.512
- Of course.
- Thank you.

12:53.655 --> 12:55.956
Uh... oh.

12:56.454 --> 12:58.622
My St. Ignacius medallion.

12:59.048 --> 13:01.449
Uh, peace be with you.

13:10.937 --> 13:13.539
He's gonna pay for everything he's done.

13:14.138 --> 13:15.605
Let's get to it.

13:40.941 --> 13:42.408
Reece isn't here yet.

13:42.507 --> 13:44.441
We have everything we need?

13:44.447 --> 13:46.248
We do. Padre?

13:46.456 --> 13:48.857
It'll be a doozy of a
confession this week.

13:48.863 --> 13:50.941
Well, you're helping
bring down a murderer.

13:51.008 --> 13:52.309
God'll forgive you.

13:52.377 --> 13:54.478
Did you, uh... bring my thing?

13:57.421 --> 13:58.754
Excellent.

13:58.760 --> 14:00.517
So, what's the plan?

14:00.585 --> 14:02.652
Lexi will get this on Reece.

14:02.658 --> 14:04.192
Somewhere it won't be noticed.

14:04.198 --> 14:06.499
This recording device
will transmit to you.

14:06.558 --> 14:08.726
Range should cover
anywhere in the building.

14:08.732 --> 14:10.799
I'll try to get Reece to confess.

14:10.805 --> 14:12.674
So, if they check you
for a recording device,

14:12.680 --> 14:13.981
they won't find one on you.

14:13.987 --> 14:15.146
Smart.

14:15.152 --> 14:17.053
Well, Reece likely
won't confess anything

14:17.059 --> 14:18.759
to Danny, but keep
recording just in case.

14:18.765 --> 14:20.132
If he's rattled enough,

14:20.138 --> 14:21.805
he might say something
to one of his security

14:21.811 --> 14:23.618
- and implicate himself.
- What, like, "They know"

14:23.624 --> 14:25.323
I poisoned Castillo, go murder them"?

14:25.329 --> 14:26.624
That would be perfect.

14:26.630 --> 14:28.197
It probably won't be that clear-cut.

14:28.932 --> 14:30.066
Am I interrupting?

14:30.134 --> 14:32.702
Simon, of course not.

14:32.770 --> 14:35.405
Simon Hardwick. I'm one of the heroes

14:35.411 --> 14:37.613
of the hour. Kind of.

14:37.619 --> 14:39.577
So, uh, what are you guys doing here?

14:39.583 --> 14:41.210
History's being made.

14:41.278 --> 14:42.779
We wouldn't miss it for the world.

14:42.785 --> 14:44.720
Well, I'm just here for
the champagne and my check.

14:44.726 --> 14:46.744
Somebody told me
that the line for the valet

14:46.750 --> 14:48.251
is ridiculously long.

14:48.319 --> 14:50.687
So I'm getting out of
here as soon as I can.

14:50.972 --> 14:52.673
I suggest you all do the same.

15:01.463 --> 15:04.232
- Such a pleasure.
- Thank you.

15:37.510 --> 15:41.260
In 1944, my father
began a quest to recover

15:41.266 --> 15:43.471
Antony and Cleopatra.

15:44.174 --> 15:47.676
That quest cost many lives.

15:47.878 --> 15:49.779
But finally,

15:49.785 --> 15:52.487
after so many years lost...

15:52.735 --> 15:54.903
They are reunited.

15:54.909 --> 15:57.166
They are... home.

15:57.651 --> 15:59.785
And so I present for you...

15:59.791 --> 16:02.159
Antony and Cleopatra.

16:16.633 --> 16:19.268
Thank you.

16:19.743 --> 16:21.565
Bow your head, sir.

16:23.747 --> 16:25.348
Thank you.

16:25.354 --> 16:27.121
So, we were told there would be money?

16:30.756 --> 16:33.322
There they are. Heroes of the hour.

16:33.328 --> 16:35.186
I know you said you didn't want medals,

16:35.192 --> 16:36.459
but I had them made anyway.

16:36.465 --> 16:38.999
Well, thank you for all
your help, Mr. Reece.

16:39.412 --> 16:40.669
Ah...

16:40.675 --> 16:43.094
My friends call me Jay.

16:43.100 --> 16:44.558
Well, Jay,

16:44.564 --> 16:46.332
I'm gonna let you two chat

16:46.338 --> 16:48.371
while I enjoy your beautiful exhibit.

16:51.880 --> 16:54.415
Been a long road, kid. Congratulations.

16:54.700 --> 16:55.933
Jay.

16:57.675 --> 16:59.610
Farouk's crew may be dead,

16:59.616 --> 17:02.418
but the guy the world called Farouk

17:02.424 --> 17:04.258
was a man named Rasheed Hegazi.

17:04.387 --> 17:06.055
He was just using the name.

17:06.123 --> 17:08.343
The real Karim Farouk
may still be out there.

17:08.348 --> 17:10.425
Danny, relax. Relax, it's over.

17:10.432 --> 17:11.799
Good guys won this time.

17:11.805 --> 17:13.663
Maybe, but you're still not safe.

17:14.002 --> 17:16.509
Unless you've taken care
of all the loose ends.

17:17.249 --> 17:18.749
Listen...

17:19.036 --> 17:22.739
I know a guy like yourself sometimes...

17:23.002 --> 17:24.430
You know, sometimes has to

17:24.435 --> 17:26.468
cross the line to protect himself.

17:26.944 --> 17:28.878
I understand.

17:32.145 --> 17:35.214
Well, um, I need to...

17:35.486 --> 17:37.453
See to some things, but...

17:37.521 --> 17:39.922
Thank you for the heads-up, and...

17:40.255 --> 17:42.189
Enjoy.

17:46.497 --> 17:48.764
- He knows.
- What do you mean?

17:48.770 --> 17:50.237
About Castillo. He knows.

17:50.243 --> 17:52.196
He tried to get a confession out of me.

17:52.202 --> 17:54.737
I wouldn't be surprised if he's wired.

18:42.388 --> 18:44.854
- Father Donnelly.
- Yeah.

18:44.860 --> 18:46.952
Would you mind coming
with us for a moment?

18:46.958 --> 18:48.591
O-Okay.

18:48.597 --> 18:50.064
Yeah.

18:51.432 --> 18:52.832
Gentlemen.

18:53.330 --> 18:54.816
Gentlemen?

18:54.822 --> 18:56.546
If you wouldn't mind holding up

18:56.552 --> 18:58.162
your medals for our photographer...

18:58.168 --> 18:59.252
- No, no.
- No, uh...

18:59.258 --> 19:01.070
- I don't want to be in the paper.
- Absolutely no photographs.

19:01.076 --> 19:03.010
Thank you very much.

19:03.941 --> 19:05.808
What just happened?

19:05.876 --> 19:07.476
I saw you and Simon run off

19:07.482 --> 19:09.216
like somebody was asking you a favor.

19:09.222 --> 19:11.042
They tried to take my
picture for the paper.

19:11.048 --> 19:13.182
I don't need my picture
out there with a fake name.

19:13.188 --> 19:14.220
Yeah.

19:14.226 --> 19:16.187
- What's wrong with Simon?
- I don't know.

19:16.193 --> 19:18.220
What can I say? Dude is strange.

19:18.226 --> 19:19.426
We got bigger issues.

19:19.432 --> 19:21.763
I know. I think I
tipped my hand to Reece.

19:21.769 --> 19:24.555
Oh, definitely. He talked
about it to his security team.

19:24.561 --> 19:27.330
Not exactly a confession,
but pretty close.

19:27.336 --> 19:28.670
That's great.

19:28.676 --> 19:30.666
Not great. The bug went dead.

19:30.672 --> 19:31.939
They found it.

19:32.069 --> 19:34.503
Okay, well, at least
we have the recording.

19:34.571 --> 19:36.005
Maybe that'll be enough.

19:38.782 --> 19:39.967
Gwen.

19:39.973 --> 19:41.811
Danny, we have a problem.

19:41.817 --> 19:43.084
There's no toxin here.

19:43.090 --> 19:44.290
Wait, what do you mean?

19:44.296 --> 19:45.663
You said they blew it up.

19:45.669 --> 19:48.317
Yeah, they blew up the
canisters, but they were empty.

19:49.302 --> 19:51.270
Gwen, hold on. What's the problem?

19:51.276 --> 19:53.952
I just saw Farouk's wheelman
dressed as a museum guard.

19:53.958 --> 19:55.125
If he's here...

19:55.131 --> 19:57.666
The truck explosion in
Tanis was misdirection.

19:58.061 --> 19:59.195
What?

19:59.262 --> 20:00.511
No.

20:05.235 --> 20:07.203
Why didn't he want his
picture in the paper?

20:07.209 --> 20:09.344
He said he wanted the limelight.

20:09.473 --> 20:11.841
- Who?
- Simon Hardwick.

20:12.488 --> 20:15.007
He's been there since
the very beginning.

20:15.762 --> 20:17.730
He's the one to give me
the name "Karim Farouk"

20:17.736 --> 20:19.243
when he was rescued in Iraq.

20:19.249 --> 20:21.031
He gave us the picture.

20:21.037 --> 20:23.725
He was at the underground
bazaar, Jessica Wong's,

20:23.854 --> 20:26.522
every step of the hunt.

20:26.590 --> 20:28.024
Simon gave us the tip.

20:28.030 --> 20:29.693
Without him, we never would have found

20:29.699 --> 20:31.565
Antony and Cleopatra. We never would...

20:33.664 --> 20:36.966
- Wait, Simon killed Farouk.
- No.

20:36.972 --> 20:39.506
He killed Rasheed Hegazi.

20:39.512 --> 20:41.747
The only one who knew
the truth of who he was.

20:44.627 --> 20:47.528
Simon Hardwick is Karim Farouk,

20:48.011 --> 20:50.479
and the real attack is
about to happen here.

20:58.941 --> 21:01.519
_

21:05.505 --> 21:08.278
_

21:08.312 --> 21:13.462
_

21:14.284 --> 21:16.971
_

21:17.016 --> 21:19.610
_

21:19.616 --> 21:22.719
_

21:23.427 --> 21:26.763
_

21:27.835 --> 21:30.335
_

21:30.357 --> 21:32.388
_

21:32.394 --> 21:35.024
_

21:35.040 --> 21:37.842
You talk of the West as if
you are not a part of it.

21:37.909 --> 21:39.677
My mother was Egyptian.

21:40.266 --> 21:43.247
I was born in a slum outside of Cairo.

21:43.315 --> 21:45.883
Over this last year, I've
realized that you and I

21:45.889 --> 21:48.624
want many of the same things, Rasheed.

21:48.630 --> 21:50.316
The only difference is I actually know

21:50.322 --> 21:52.302
how to get a hold of them.

21:52.308 --> 21:54.109
Enlighten us.

21:59.030 --> 22:00.965
If you try and run...

22:01.032 --> 22:04.599
I'll be dead within ten
paces, no doubt. Yes.

22:10.380 --> 22:12.214
But I'm not trying to run.

22:12.902 --> 22:15.546
I'm more interested
in forming an alliance.

22:16.245 --> 22:19.111
First issue that you
face, as far as I can see,

22:19.117 --> 22:20.985
is you're getting fleeced
on these treasures

22:20.991 --> 22:23.109
by a series of greedy middlemen.

22:23.115 --> 22:26.318
Middlemen are necessary
to moving antiquities.

22:26.324 --> 22:28.064
It's a cost of doing business.

22:28.070 --> 22:29.333
For terrorists...

22:29.339 --> 22:31.878
Pardon the expression...
It's the cost of doing business.

22:31.884 --> 22:33.722
For a man such as myself,

22:33.728 --> 22:35.896
born in the Middle East
but educated in the West,

22:35.902 --> 22:38.703
it's a pitiable waste of money.

22:47.813 --> 22:50.448
All of these holdings belong to one man,

22:50.515 --> 22:52.266
Jacob Reece.

22:53.106 --> 22:55.477
He and his family have been bleeding

22:55.483 --> 22:57.716
this region dry for generations.

22:57.784 --> 22:59.151
Oh...

22:59.157 --> 23:00.925
What's that expression?

23:00.931 --> 23:02.902
To kill the beast,

23:04.515 --> 23:06.091
you must aim at his heart.

23:06.097 --> 23:09.500
Bigger targets mean more risk.

23:09.630 --> 23:11.102
More losses.

23:11.108 --> 23:13.837
I can also ensure that I make you much,

23:13.843 --> 23:15.167
much more money.

23:15.173 --> 23:17.448
It sounds too good to be true.

23:17.454 --> 23:19.772
How do we know you will do as you say?

23:19.778 --> 23:22.546
Well, I'm not asking for
you to let me go, am I?

23:24.608 --> 23:28.581
By now, the Americans
must be looking for me.

23:28.587 --> 23:30.888
Well, I hope so... well, really,
they're looking for you.

23:31.018 --> 23:33.519
At the rate you're going,
they can't be far off.

23:33.525 --> 23:38.462
We can use my inevitable
rescue to our advantage.

23:39.099 --> 23:42.034
I can prove to be an
unimpeachable source on you,

23:42.040 --> 23:43.907
give them just so much information

23:43.913 --> 23:45.314
as to prove myself useful,

23:45.402 --> 23:47.571
and manipulate them from the inside.

23:47.639 --> 23:50.541
And what information will you give them?

23:50.609 --> 23:54.345
Every bogeyman needs a name, don't they?

23:54.497 --> 23:56.152
I was thinking...

23:57.954 --> 23:59.628
Karim Farouk.

23:59.634 --> 24:02.047
You shall be Karim Farouk.

24:02.053 --> 24:05.489
And that name will give
our enemy sleepless nights

24:05.557 --> 24:07.892
for the rest of their lives.

24:13.121 --> 24:15.044
_

24:15.050 --> 24:17.229
He's been ahead of us the whole time.

24:17.235 --> 24:20.170
Everything he's done has
led him to this moment.

24:20.440 --> 24:22.441
Gwen, you there?

24:22.447 --> 24:24.735
Yes, I'm on my way to Cairo!

24:25.744 --> 24:27.444
I will alert the Egyptian authorities

24:27.450 --> 24:29.287
while I'm in the air!

24:29.626 --> 24:31.527
Get them to prep antidote
for the mycotoxin

24:31.533 --> 24:33.646
for at least 300 people.

24:33.652 --> 24:35.786
I'm on my way, Danny!

24:39.890 --> 24:41.224
Go, go, go, go!

24:45.042 --> 24:47.143
We still got time to get out of here.

24:47.149 --> 24:49.150
We can't just leave these people now.

24:49.218 --> 24:51.152
Ain't no way I'm letting
that mummy cancer get me.

24:51.158 --> 24:53.414
- Wait... Shaw!
- Bloody perfect.

24:53.420 --> 24:55.454
I guess it's just us.

24:56.352 --> 24:58.543
Wait, where's Chuck?

24:58.549 --> 25:00.550
We got to clear this place out now.

25:00.556 --> 25:02.123
Come on, I know the way.

25:05.667 --> 25:08.146
I saw a fire alarm here earlier.

25:08.609 --> 25:09.743
There.

25:11.215 --> 25:13.683
I'm gonna need the two
of you to come with us.

25:14.009 --> 25:16.844
Over your literal dead bodies.

25:16.912 --> 25:19.280
Well, we don't need to
make a scene, now, do we?

25:19.348 --> 25:21.716
Oh, we're gonna make a scene.

25:32.828 --> 25:35.759
Really tired of being electrocuted.

25:36.231 --> 25:39.267
You were the one after
us in Boston and Havana.

25:39.334 --> 25:41.669
I owe you an ass-beating.

25:41.737 --> 25:43.704
I never got to finish yours.

25:43.710 --> 25:45.945
So, you work for Reece?

25:45.951 --> 25:47.596
Well, you need to warn him and

25:47.602 --> 25:49.406
everybody else in this building

25:49.412 --> 25:52.713
Simon Hardwick is Karim Farouk.

25:52.719 --> 25:54.887
He has a bioweapon.

25:54.893 --> 25:57.185
Sorry, not buying it.

25:57.191 --> 25:59.092
We know all about your little plan

25:59.098 --> 26:00.704
to try and stop Reece.

26:00.710 --> 26:02.028
No.

26:04.290 --> 26:05.857
N-N-N-N-No, no, no, no!

26:09.398 --> 26:11.132
Who else knows about Castillo?

26:11.902 --> 26:14.802
Aside from your friend Shaw,
who we're looking for,

26:14.808 --> 26:16.705
and your friend Father Donnelly,

26:16.711 --> 26:18.074
who we already have.

26:25.310 --> 26:27.645
It's simple. You talk or he dies.

26:28.565 --> 26:29.698
Who else knows?

26:43.110 --> 26:45.311
- Mr. Reece.
- Oh, yes, hi.

26:45.317 --> 26:46.330
Uh, we met earlier?

26:46.336 --> 26:47.579
Yes. Simon. Simon Hardwick.

26:47.585 --> 26:49.569
- A-Actually, I received the award.
- Ah.

26:49.575 --> 26:51.168
- Only I'm not wearing it now.
- Congratulations.

26:51.174 --> 26:52.718
That's why you didn't
recognize me. Thank you.

26:52.724 --> 26:54.933
Thank you. Do you mind if I
borrow him for a second, please?

26:54.939 --> 26:56.721
- Yeah.
- Uh, funny enough, we-we-we

26:56.727 --> 26:58.072
almost met years ago.

26:58.078 --> 27:00.580
- Uh-huh.
- Yes, uh, you knew my mother.

27:00.586 --> 27:02.354
- Did I?
- Yes, uh,

27:02.459 --> 27:05.228
uh, unfortunately she wasn't very well.

27:05.234 --> 27:06.749
Yeah, no, she, uh...

27:07.038 --> 27:08.315
Well, it's an understatement,

27:08.321 --> 27:10.096
she was really ill. Uh, she, uh...

27:10.102 --> 27:12.642
- Mm.
- She had a rare disease,

27:12.648 --> 27:15.117
a toxin usually found in old tombs,

27:15.184 --> 27:17.586
and it was killing her slowly.

27:17.715 --> 27:19.716
Uh, doctors couldn't
diagnose what it was,

27:19.722 --> 27:21.490
and she was poor.

27:21.557 --> 27:24.926
Very poor, so, so her care
wasn't very good anyway.

27:24.932 --> 27:27.867
And that's when I came to your office,

27:27.873 --> 27:29.993
hoping that you might
be able to afford her

27:29.999 --> 27:32.300
the care she so urgently needed.

27:32.306 --> 27:33.641
Uh...

27:35.204 --> 27:37.339
Obviously, I told them I was your child.

27:37.406 --> 27:39.841
But I was sent away. They
said you didn't have a son.

27:39.847 --> 27:41.389
- Uh...
- But we know differently,

27:41.395 --> 27:43.417
don't we, Dad? Yeah.

27:45.193 --> 27:48.195
Do you know how hard it
was for a single woman

27:48.201 --> 27:51.197
to bring up an illegitimate
child in Egypt back then?

27:52.534 --> 27:54.301
We were mocked.

27:54.450 --> 27:56.384
She was shamed.

27:56.859 --> 27:59.027
And I was beaten up so
badly by the other boys,

27:59.033 --> 28:00.891
I could barely walk,
and that's when my mum

28:00.897 --> 28:02.831
took the check that you
gave her to buy her off

28:02.837 --> 28:05.271
and sent me away to a
boarding school in England.

28:05.277 --> 28:07.898
How do you think those little
rich, entitled sociopaths

28:07.904 --> 28:09.471
treated a young Egyptian boy

28:09.477 --> 28:11.511
who didn't speak the Queen's English?

28:11.641 --> 28:13.341
And I had to give up my upbringing,

28:13.347 --> 28:15.782
my culture. I became a
product of my surroundings.

28:15.788 --> 28:17.950
- My surroundings were hell.
- I think you should leave,

28:17.956 --> 28:19.548
and I think you should
leave immediately.

28:19.554 --> 28:21.088
Yeah, no, I don't think I will.

28:21.094 --> 28:22.448
I don't think anyone will,

28:22.454 --> 28:25.103
- 'cause your doors are locked.
- What...?

28:26.822 --> 28:27.989
Security!

28:41.231 --> 28:44.000
As I was saying, in a funny way...

28:44.006 --> 28:46.341
Well, funny in a nasty,
ironic kind of way,

28:46.347 --> 28:48.281
all of this would have come to nothing

28:48.287 --> 28:50.455
had fate not stepped in and lent a hand.

28:50.646 --> 28:53.582
Had it not given me
a vessel for my rage.

28:53.649 --> 28:57.118
And I gave that vessel my real
name so that you would know

28:57.124 --> 28:59.913
that your son was out there,
and one of these days

28:59.919 --> 29:01.641
he'd be coming for you.

29:02.291 --> 29:04.559
And I'm happy to say, Dad,

29:04.627 --> 29:06.628
the day of reckoning...

29:07.802 --> 29:09.803
... has arrived.

29:28.547 --> 29:30.234
Because right now...

29:31.399 --> 29:33.388
... I am going to watch you...

29:34.561 --> 29:36.558
... and all these other...

29:37.359 --> 29:38.670
People...

29:41.290 --> 29:44.959
... the upper crust
of the East and West,

29:45.301 --> 29:48.470
who abandoned us and beat us...

29:49.236 --> 29:51.172
I'm gonna watch you die.

29:52.248 --> 29:54.682
Much like I watched my mother die.

29:55.210 --> 29:57.912
Only, fortunately for you
and unluckily for me,

29:57.918 --> 30:00.486
it's gonna happen much, much faster.

30:03.377 --> 30:05.126
I'll ask one more time.

30:05.132 --> 30:06.924
Who else knows about Castillo?

30:06.930 --> 30:09.637
I gave the evidence we found to the FBI.

30:09.643 --> 30:11.344
If we disappear,
they'll know it was you.

30:11.756 --> 30:13.518
Oh, will they?

30:15.149 --> 30:16.683
What's my name?

30:18.200 --> 30:20.181
They have your picture.

30:20.187 --> 30:22.655
You have nothing, just like I thought.

30:40.068 --> 30:41.733
We got this. Go.

30:43.877 --> 30:46.479
I can feel the end.

30:46.547 --> 30:48.187
Go to her, Danny.

30:48.193 --> 30:50.121
Be with your love.

30:52.720 --> 30:55.655
Son of a... Shaw.

30:55.723 --> 30:57.957
The medal took the hit.

30:59.627 --> 31:02.328
Man, I can't even die heroically.

31:04.141 --> 31:05.970
Hey, thanks for coming
back for us, Shaw.

31:05.976 --> 31:08.296
Yeah. No problem.

31:08.302 --> 31:09.494
Get Chuck somewhere safe.

31:09.500 --> 31:10.970
What are you gonna do?

31:11.038 --> 31:12.805
I'm gonna go stop Simon.

31:14.775 --> 31:16.542
Come on, little buddy.

31:16.610 --> 31:18.678
And you're experiencing now

31:18.746 --> 31:21.626
what my mother experienced
after two months.

31:22.243 --> 31:24.485
Soon your throat will close up,

31:24.825 --> 31:27.282
making it impossible to breathe.

31:27.288 --> 31:30.890
And your brain will swell,
making you delirious.

31:30.958 --> 31:33.059
I never knew.

31:33.065 --> 31:34.532
You never cared.

31:48.067 --> 31:49.801
I couldn't give up my life.

31:49.807 --> 31:52.865
- I had responsibilities...
- I was your responsibility!

32:00.422 --> 32:02.305
But you taught her well,
I'll give you that,

32:02.311 --> 32:03.845
and she had a good eye.

32:03.857 --> 32:07.226
Uh, she never gave up
hope of finding Cleopatra.

32:07.294 --> 32:08.628
Of course she never did.

32:10.494 --> 32:13.436
She'd find the odd
trinket here or there...

32:14.099 --> 32:16.139
Sell it to support us.

32:16.145 --> 32:18.738
And eventually that's what killed her.

32:22.776 --> 32:24.911
So here we are, Dad.

32:26.213 --> 32:29.549
Finally, the world will
know the whole story.

32:31.783 --> 32:34.191
How you abandoned your child.

32:35.114 --> 32:38.182
How you murdered people
to keep it a secret.

32:40.043 --> 32:42.778
And how your secret
ended up murdering you.

32:44.832 --> 32:47.266
Hey, bitch.

32:53.053 --> 32:54.841
You're not going anywhere.

32:57.396 --> 32:59.497
You'll regret trying to stop me.

33:00.446 --> 33:02.815
You know, I've been thinking.

33:02.883 --> 33:04.538
If you're Reece's fixer,

33:04.544 --> 33:05.990
you must be the one

33:05.996 --> 33:08.097
who planted the bomb
that killed my father.

33:08.222 --> 33:11.059
Is it worth dying to find out?

33:11.065 --> 33:14.037
I did say I owe you
an ass-beating, so...

33:14.503 --> 33:17.271
Let's settle this like ladies, shall we?

34:26.266 --> 34:28.167
Aren't you going to kill me?

34:31.851 --> 34:33.717
He wouldn't do it.

34:37.945 --> 34:40.947
Ah, she'd totally do it.

34:49.656 --> 34:51.724
You can come in!

34:55.324 --> 34:57.559
We have the antidote.

35:03.191 --> 35:05.388
I have medical training. I can help.

35:05.394 --> 35:06.716
No.

35:07.716 --> 35:09.083
Let him die.

35:10.879 --> 35:12.044
Danny.

35:16.184 --> 35:18.117
- What...?
- What are you doing?

35:18.840 --> 35:20.681
He killed your father

35:20.687 --> 35:23.322
and ruined my father's life,

35:23.390 --> 35:26.392
murdered Castillo and God
knows how many other people.

35:27.743 --> 35:30.825
And now we have no proof of anything.

35:32.184 --> 35:34.362
I'm not letting him get away with it.

35:34.368 --> 35:37.003
Don't you see, he's not
gonna get away with it.

35:37.070 --> 35:39.605
He's gonna get his worst nightmare.

35:39.900 --> 35:43.156
Danny, the whole world
will know what he's done.

35:43.735 --> 35:46.245
His name, his reputation,

35:46.251 --> 35:48.477
his entire family legacy will be ruined.

35:48.727 --> 35:51.584
And he'll watch it all happen
while rotting behind bars.

35:53.301 --> 35:55.202
Look at me, Danny.

35:55.208 --> 35:57.643
I took his assassin alive.

35:57.649 --> 35:59.382
She's outside in custody.

35:59.388 --> 36:01.507
We can get her to testify
to everything he's done.

36:01.513 --> 36:04.156
Reece has destroyed so many lives.

36:04.162 --> 36:06.710
Oh... I know.

36:08.379 --> 36:10.680
I'm not gonna let him
destroy yours, too.

36:21.214 --> 36:22.908
Guys...

36:23.617 --> 36:25.551
Where's Simon?

36:28.840 --> 36:31.350
So we checked all over of
Farouk's known holdings,

36:31.356 --> 36:32.923
and the day after Simon disappeared,

36:32.929 --> 36:34.762
a vault at the Janus Freeport

36:34.768 --> 36:36.537
in Geneva was cleared out.

36:36.543 --> 36:39.276
The director, Rory Muller, confirmed

36:39.282 --> 36:41.060
that Simon Hardwick was there.

36:41.206 --> 36:42.738
Looks like Simon was stashing

36:42.744 --> 36:44.592
away a little rainy-day treasure.

36:44.850 --> 36:46.785
Jessica Wong confirmed the items hit

36:46.791 --> 36:49.493
the underground market
about 72 hours ago.

36:49.499 --> 36:51.375
And were sold at an auction

36:51.443 --> 36:52.977
from an unnamed seller.

36:53.044 --> 36:55.312
We intercepted the buyer
and collected the items,

36:55.318 --> 36:57.586
but we couldn't connect
the money to the seller,

36:57.592 --> 36:59.745
because the money was laundered

36:59.751 --> 37:01.318
through a Mafia-connected business.

37:01.386 --> 37:03.988
Though we do know someone
with the connections

37:03.994 --> 37:05.662
to help us with that last piece.

37:05.668 --> 37:07.387
We believe Carlo Velardi

37:07.393 --> 37:09.276
can give us Hardwick's location.

37:09.282 --> 37:12.184
But as of now, he's
been reticent to talk.

37:12.190 --> 37:15.261
I imagine if we shaved a few
years off of his sentence,

37:15.267 --> 37:16.667
that would loosen his tongue.

37:16.735 --> 37:18.369
Thank you, General.

37:18.436 --> 37:19.954
I'll make the deal.

37:21.273 --> 37:23.649
Before we go after Simon,

37:24.262 --> 37:26.596
I just need to ask one favor.

37:26.945 --> 37:29.847
I need you to deputize me.

37:34.391 --> 37:37.125
_

37:45.520 --> 37:48.389
Graham Townsend, is it?

37:50.216 --> 37:52.718
Where do you get these names?

37:57.871 --> 38:00.272
- How did you find me?
- You're not really getting

38:00.278 --> 38:04.014
this whole "we track bad guys
through their treasure" thing,

38:04.082 --> 38:05.249
are you?

38:05.829 --> 38:07.618
Hello, Danny.

38:08.391 --> 38:10.354
Karim Farouk,

38:10.422 --> 38:12.189
you're under arrest.

38:20.608 --> 38:23.133
Well, you got to do what
you got to do, I suppose.

38:23.201 --> 38:25.936
But you should know...

38:26.004 --> 38:28.105
It wasn't personal.

38:28.133 --> 38:30.233
Well, not to you, at least.

38:30.239 --> 38:32.810
It was deeply personal to me.

38:32.816 --> 38:34.294
It was revenge...

38:34.300 --> 38:35.690
For my mother.

38:35.728 --> 38:38.029
I'd have thought out of all
the people in the world,

38:38.035 --> 38:39.427
you'd be able to understand that.

38:39.433 --> 38:42.052
You would have murdered
everyone at that gala.

38:42.120 --> 38:44.254
I tried to give you a fair
warning, though, didn't I?

38:44.322 --> 38:46.657
Let you get out... I mean,
it was a subtle nod.

38:46.663 --> 38:48.123
Nonetheless...

38:49.798 --> 38:51.326
I like you guys.

38:51.956 --> 38:53.380
And Reece hurt us.

38:53.551 --> 38:54.894
Each one of us.

38:56.622 --> 38:57.889
Come on.

38:58.899 --> 39:01.625
We're practically on the same side.

39:02.240 --> 39:05.409
Karim, Simon, whatever
I'm supposed to call you,

39:05.415 --> 39:08.684
you look at the gun under
the magazine one more time,

39:08.690 --> 39:10.124
I'm just gonna shoot you.

39:10.130 --> 39:11.574
I forgot it was there

39:11.580 --> 39:13.651
until you reminded me just right now.

39:16.502 --> 39:19.023
You'll find it ironic, as I do,

39:19.090 --> 39:21.338
that here you are to arrest me,

39:22.093 --> 39:24.795
but actually the only man I ever killed

39:24.863 --> 39:26.497
was Rasheed Hegazi.

39:26.503 --> 39:28.678
Oh, you can't possibly believe that.

39:28.684 --> 39:30.868
I do believe it, and he deserved it.

39:30.935 --> 39:33.437
That's something we can all agree on.

39:34.722 --> 39:37.490
He was a stone-cold killer.

39:39.611 --> 39:41.679
I'm not the bad guy.

39:43.176 --> 39:44.610
Yes.

39:45.350 --> 39:47.317
Yes, you are.

39:47.385 --> 39:49.353
Nothing personal.

40:09.551 --> 40:11.801
I'm sure I'll be seeing
you guys soon enough.

40:12.538 --> 40:16.240
After all, the world's such
a small place these days.

40:35.338 --> 40:37.722
_

41:55.563 --> 41:56.912
So, uh...

41:57.952 --> 42:00.682
Thanks for not listening
to me when I said I,

42:01.072 --> 42:02.471
you know,

42:02.790 --> 42:04.791
never wanted to see you again.

42:31.702 --> 42:34.608
