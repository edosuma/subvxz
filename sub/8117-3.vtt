WEBVTT

00:25.459 --> 00:27.728
Huh, this way a little more,
come on, come on.

00:31.465 --> 00:35.069
Oh, hey, h-hey, hey, hey,
come on.

00:35.103 --> 00:37.305
Hey, come on.

00:37.338 --> 00:38.706
Come on.

00:38.739 --> 00:41.109
Oh, come on, no fair.

00:44.145 --> 00:47.548
Come on, come on.

00:59.727 --> 01:00.794
Hey.

01:01.762 --> 01:04.265
Oh, look at all the flowers,
pretty flowers.

01:36.197 --> 01:37.641
What kind of work were
they doing out there?

01:37.665 --> 01:39.267
It's just standard
field research,

01:39.300 --> 01:40.501
it's nothing dangerous.

01:40.534 --> 01:42.703
Yeah, then why hasn't
anyone heard from them

01:42.736 --> 01:44.172
in the last 72 hours?

01:44.205 --> 01:45.949
Well, that's what we're
going there to find out.

01:45.973 --> 01:48.409
Stop worrying.
Commander Taylor says

01:48.442 --> 01:49.853
we'll probably be back
before dinner.

01:49.877 --> 01:50.944
Well, you'd better be

01:50.978 --> 01:52.689
'cause that Reynolds kid is
coming a-courting tonight.

01:52.713 --> 01:53.614
Oh, don't make fun.

01:53.647 --> 01:54.991
I think it's really sweet,
the way he's going

01:55.015 --> 01:56.193
about things
the old-fashioned way.

01:56.217 --> 01:57.318
Well, I think
it's weird.

01:57.351 --> 01:59.287
I'm telling you,
it's a tech situation,

01:59.320 --> 02:00.588
not a science situation.

02:00.621 --> 02:02.022
The signal has been spotty

02:02.055 --> 02:03.391
out in that area
for weeks.

02:03.424 --> 02:05.593
I'm sure it's just
a downed comm relay,

02:05.626 --> 02:08.127
but if I need you,
I will let you know.

02:08.162 --> 02:09.396
They're my people
out there.

02:09.430 --> 02:10.931
I should be
going with you.

02:10.964 --> 02:11.965
I'll take my
own rover.

02:11.999 --> 02:14.235
Don't worry, Malcolm,
I'll be your eyes out there.

02:14.268 --> 02:15.936
You'll get
a full report.

02:15.969 --> 02:17.171
Thank you, Elisabeth.

02:17.205 --> 02:19.340
Lieutenant Washington
is in command

02:19.373 --> 02:20.341
while I'm off-colony.

02:20.374 --> 02:22.276
You need anything,
you talk to her.

02:22.310 --> 02:24.745
All right, let's go.

02:26.414 --> 02:28.482
All right, be safe.

02:31.084 --> 02:33.221
Oh, no, my wedding ring.

02:34.855 --> 02:37.358
I took it off before surgery
this morning.

02:37.391 --> 02:38.959
Um, could you stop
by the hospital

02:38.992 --> 02:39.993
and pick it up for me?

02:40.027 --> 02:41.104
It should be
in my scrub locker,

02:41.128 --> 02:42.863
I think.
Uh, sure.

02:42.896 --> 02:45.399
Unless, of course,
I left it inside a patient.

02:45.433 --> 02:47.435
Doc...?
See you.

02:53.607 --> 02:55.876
So they give you
your own rover, huh?

02:55.909 --> 02:59.046
Chief Science Officer...
One of the perks of the job.

02:59.079 --> 03:02.283
Well, I'm the only cop in town,
they didn't give me one.

03:02.316 --> 03:04.985
That must be awkward

03:05.018 --> 03:07.187
with your siren.

03:18.399 --> 03:21.269
Whoa, whoa, Doc.

03:21.302 --> 03:23.271
That gate should not be open.

03:24.071 --> 03:26.474
Commander!

03:27.408 --> 03:29.477
Looks like they've had
ovosaurs out here

03:29.510 --> 03:31.345
chewing on
the power cables.

03:31.379 --> 03:34.181
Let's make sure
none of 'em wandered in.

03:34.214 --> 03:35.082
Stay alert.

03:35.115 --> 03:38.286
Don't you wander either,
Doc... stick close.

04:13.186 --> 04:16.324
What kind of work did you say
they were doing at this outpost?

04:16.357 --> 04:18.591
Wetlands research.

04:22.195 --> 04:24.332
Commander Taylor!

04:35.275 --> 04:36.944
Doc, take a
look at this.

04:47.521 --> 04:49.390
Brady, let's get
this door open.

04:49.423 --> 04:50.891
The snow was up to my knees,

04:50.924 --> 04:55.329
but I must have run
for an hour straight.

04:55.363 --> 04:57.898
I guess that's how
I wound up here.

04:59.967 --> 05:02.403
Are you with the Red Cross?

05:02.436 --> 05:04.772
Something like
that, yes.

05:04.805 --> 05:07.040
This is gonna
help you relax.

05:08.376 --> 05:11.278
Here we go.

05:11.311 --> 05:13.581
Snow up to her knees?

05:13.614 --> 05:15.483
I guess I must've missed
the blizzard.

05:15.516 --> 05:18.719
Not if you were
in Detroit in 2137.

05:18.752 --> 05:21.288
It was the coldest
October ever recorded,

05:21.321 --> 05:23.056
while the
city burned.

05:23.090 --> 05:24.758
The Detroit Food Riots.
Yeah.

05:24.792 --> 05:27.160
From what I can tell,
that's where

05:27.194 --> 05:28.061
she thinks she is.

05:28.095 --> 05:30.163
She has no idea she's
in Terra Nova. Doc,

05:30.197 --> 05:31.207
what's going on here?
I don't know.

05:31.231 --> 05:32.433
Her vitals are normal.

05:32.466 --> 05:33.643
There doesn't appear to be
anything physically wrong.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.403
It's some sort of
dissociative disorder.

05:35.436 --> 05:37.571
What about
the other two?

05:37.605 --> 05:40.674
My best guess... same thing,
only more advanced.

05:40.708 --> 05:43.110
Look, Doc, three people
don't just lose their minds

05:43.143 --> 05:44.244
at the same time.

05:44.277 --> 05:45.946
There's got to
be a reason.

05:52.085 --> 05:54.154
It's Wednesday, I think.

05:54.187 --> 05:56.256
I can't be sure.

05:56.289 --> 05:57.401
It's happening to me just like

05:57.425 --> 05:58.726
with the others.

05:58.759 --> 06:02.430
First, short-term memory becomes
jumbled, confused.

06:02.463 --> 06:05.298
Then one finds oneself somewhere
in one's past.

06:05.332 --> 06:06.299
I don't recognize him.

06:06.333 --> 06:07.635
He's not in the infirmary.

06:07.668 --> 06:09.236
This outpost has
a staff of four.

06:09.269 --> 06:11.271
That's Dr. Jonathan Guagenti.

06:11.304 --> 06:12.239
He's head
researcher here.

06:12.272 --> 06:13.474
Brady.

06:13.507 --> 06:14.642
I ought to remember

06:14.675 --> 06:16.544
the three people
in the infirmary.

06:16.577 --> 06:18.011
This fella is
still missing.

06:18.045 --> 06:21.081
Search the perimeter...
200-yard radius.

06:21.114 --> 06:22.049
Be back by sundown.

06:22.082 --> 06:22.750
Yes, sir.

06:22.783 --> 06:24.618
I know I have to tell someone

06:24.652 --> 06:26.720
about the pathogens
before they spread.

06:26.754 --> 06:30.624
I just can't remember who.

06:30.658 --> 06:33.961
Okay, a pathogen...
So that's what's behind this.

06:33.994 --> 06:36.296
So what are the chances
we've been exposed?

06:36.329 --> 06:37.765
Fairly likely,
I'm afraid.

06:37.798 --> 06:39.533
Well, it looks like he's made

06:39.567 --> 06:42.503
some progress towards
a diagnosis, but then

06:42.536 --> 06:44.204
his handwriting
just deteriorates

06:44.237 --> 06:45.439
and then it becomes

06:45.473 --> 06:46.874
a nursery rhyme.

06:46.907 --> 06:49.042
You think you can
finish what he started?

06:49.076 --> 06:51.011
I can try.

06:51.044 --> 06:52.412
Try hard, Doc.

06:52.446 --> 06:54.214
Till we know
what this is,

06:54.247 --> 06:55.516
we're not going home.

06:55.549 --> 06:57.417
Mr. Shannon.

06:57.451 --> 06:58.486
Yeah.

06:58.519 --> 06:59.352
Dr. Shannon's wedding ring.

06:59.386 --> 07:00.954
Oh, great, thanks.

07:00.988 --> 07:03.123
You didn't have to cut
anyone open, did you?

07:03.657 --> 07:06.159
Never mind, thank you.

07:06.860 --> 07:08.295
What are you two doing here?

07:08.328 --> 07:09.296
Shouldn't you
be at school?

07:09.329 --> 07:12.299
Zoe's sick, and this time
she's not pretending.

07:12.332 --> 07:13.333
It's just a cold,

07:13.366 --> 07:14.602
but they asked me to take her

07:14.635 --> 07:16.103
out of class.

07:16.136 --> 07:17.571
I need Mommy.

07:17.605 --> 07:20.040
Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie,
Mommy's not here.

07:20.073 --> 07:21.141
Where is she?

07:21.174 --> 07:22.819
Well, she had to go
save some other people.

07:22.843 --> 07:24.812
Tell you what, why
don't we go see

07:24.845 --> 07:26.523
if there's anything in
this hospital for a cold,

07:26.547 --> 07:27.781
and then I
take you home?

07:27.815 --> 07:29.182
Just be careful.

07:29.216 --> 07:29.950
Don't catch her cold.

07:29.983 --> 07:31.485
I never catch colds.

07:32.620 --> 07:34.321
Only crooks.

07:42.295 --> 07:43.731
Ah, here's another one.

07:44.498 --> 07:46.800
To the stars.

07:46.834 --> 07:50.070
God, they're
beautiful.

07:50.804 --> 07:53.541
Hey, any word from
Outpost Three?

07:53.574 --> 07:54.575
I heard they
went dark.

07:54.608 --> 07:56.577
My mom's out there now...
Nothing yet.

08:02.516 --> 08:04.284
You're good.

08:06.153 --> 08:08.488
Thanks.

08:08.522 --> 08:10.190
No, don't stop.

08:18.899 --> 08:21.101
Any luck finding
Guagenti?

08:21.134 --> 08:24.605
Found his boots.

08:24.638 --> 08:25.773
He's out there
barefoot?

08:25.806 --> 08:29.509
No, his feet were still in 'em.

08:31.111 --> 08:32.780
You got enough to go on
to figure out

08:32.813 --> 08:34.214
what we're dealing with here?

08:34.246 --> 08:35.616
Yeah, I think so.

08:35.649 --> 08:36.817
All right.

08:36.850 --> 08:39.186
This outpost is
under general quarantine...

08:39.219 --> 08:40.486
Nobody in or out.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.856
I'm not going
to risk exposing

08:42.890 --> 08:45.693
anyone or the
colony to this.

08:45.726 --> 08:46.970
So do... do you know what it is?

08:46.994 --> 08:48.361
Some kind
of memory loss.

08:48.395 --> 08:49.196
Could be anything...

08:49.229 --> 08:52.532
Contaminated rations
or an insect bite.

08:52.566 --> 08:53.743
I'm running blood samples now.

08:53.767 --> 08:55.468
I should know more soon.

08:55.502 --> 08:56.436
You're not just making
all this up

08:56.469 --> 08:58.271
to get out of tonight, are you?
Of course not.

08:58.305 --> 09:01.008
What time's Maddy's
gentleman caller coming, anyway?

09:01.041 --> 09:03.176
I don't know,
but she's changed outfits,

09:03.210 --> 09:04.077
like...

09:04.111 --> 09:05.746
...three times already.

09:05.779 --> 09:07.347
I used to do that for you,
you know.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.116
Be nice to him.

09:09.149 --> 09:10.117
I'll try.

09:10.150 --> 09:12.152
I love you.

09:12.185 --> 09:12.853
Love you, too.

09:12.886 --> 09:13.854
Kiss the
kids for me.

09:13.887 --> 09:15.355
All right.

09:15.388 --> 09:17.858
What was that?

09:17.891 --> 09:19.727
Oh, I picked up a cold.

09:19.760 --> 09:20.994
Fluids and
straight to bed.

09:21.028 --> 09:22.963
I don't want to catch your cold
when I get back.

09:22.996 --> 09:24.932
It's not my cold
I borrowed it from Zoe.

09:24.965 --> 09:26.533
Okay, feel better,
I'll call you

09:26.566 --> 09:29.002
in the morning. Bye.

09:29.036 --> 09:30.203
Bye.

09:40.313 --> 09:42.315
Zoe?

09:43.617 --> 09:46.019
Who's Zoe?

09:52.592 --> 09:54.127
Some more
Key lime pie?

09:54.161 --> 09:56.196
Not that there's
actually any lime in it

09:56.229 --> 09:59.466
because limes won't evolve
until millions of years later.

09:59.499 --> 10:00.768
Anyway...
So,

10:00.801 --> 10:03.971
uh, do you find that
you enjoy cooking?

10:04.004 --> 10:07.007
Yeah, um, it's kind of
like chemistry,

10:07.040 --> 10:09.342
except, at the end,
you get a treat.

10:10.443 --> 10:12.312
Um, I should get going.

10:12.345 --> 10:13.847
Right, yeah.

10:13.881 --> 10:15.983
Oh, sorry.
Oh.

10:16.016 --> 10:17.484
Whoops.

10:17.517 --> 10:19.386
Well, um, thank you
for welcoming me

10:19.419 --> 10:20.654
into your home.

10:20.688 --> 10:23.957
Uh, bye, Mr. Shannon.

10:26.927 --> 10:28.896
Okay, tell me the truth...

10:28.929 --> 10:30.130
Was that the worst first date

10:30.163 --> 10:32.265
in the history
of the universe?

10:32.299 --> 10:33.233
Not even close.

10:33.266 --> 10:34.234
Yeah,

10:34.267 --> 10:35.779
you're just saying that
to make me feel better.

10:35.803 --> 10:37.013
I'm saying it 'cause I lived it.

10:37.037 --> 10:39.306
It was my first date
with your mom.

10:39.339 --> 10:43.043
She was so astronomically
out of my league...

10:43.076 --> 10:44.954
A fact that her friends
brought up constantly...

10:44.978 --> 10:46.747
By the time
I picked her up,

10:46.780 --> 10:49.482
I'd psyched myself out so much,

10:49.516 --> 10:52.720
I was a total wreck.

10:52.753 --> 10:54.487
But when it was all over,

10:54.521 --> 10:56.523
guess what?

10:56.556 --> 10:57.991
I asked her out again

10:58.025 --> 11:00.994
'cause I knew that,
no matter

11:01.028 --> 11:03.764
how much of a fool
I made out of myself,

11:03.797 --> 11:07.367
in the end,
it'd be worth it.

11:13.140 --> 11:14.808
What's the word
from Outpost Three?

11:14.842 --> 11:16.509
Still waiting.

11:16.543 --> 11:17.778
What do you mean?

11:17.811 --> 11:19.780
Shouldn't they have
checked in?

11:19.813 --> 11:21.214
Yes, but we've been having

11:21.248 --> 11:23.784
communication
problems out that way

11:23.817 --> 11:24.952
for the past week or so.

11:24.985 --> 11:26.754
Well, maybe you should
send another team

11:26.787 --> 11:27.955
to see if they're okay.

11:27.988 --> 11:31.058
Commander Taylor left me
with very specific orders.

11:31.091 --> 11:32.860
Until he directs otherwise,

11:32.893 --> 11:34.728
Outpost Three is under
general quarantine.

11:34.762 --> 11:36.096
Quarantine?!

11:36.129 --> 11:38.098
No, no, I spoke to
my wife last night.

11:38.131 --> 11:39.499
She never used the
word quarantine.

11:39.532 --> 11:42.469
If Commander Taylor hasn't
checked in by nightfall,

11:42.502 --> 11:44.637
I will consider sending
another team at that time.

11:44.671 --> 11:46.049
No, no, I'm not waiting
around for that.

11:46.073 --> 11:47.583
I'm going out there.
That is out of the question.

11:47.607 --> 11:50.543
You will remain here, and
as soon as I know anything more,

11:50.577 --> 11:53.080
you will be informed.

11:53.113 --> 11:54.882
Understood.

11:54.915 --> 11:57.184
I need your rover.
And I need

11:57.217 --> 11:59.820
my favorite reading glasses
that I left back in Boston.

11:59.853 --> 12:01.588
Elisabeth's in trouble.

12:01.621 --> 12:02.655
What's going on?

12:02.689 --> 12:05.893
I don't know, but Outpost Three
is under quarantine.

12:05.926 --> 12:07.761
Ah, where do you think
you're going?

12:07.795 --> 12:09.930
To lodge a complaint
with Lieutenant Washington.

12:09.963 --> 12:11.598
All science outposts
are my jurisdiction.

12:11.631 --> 12:14.201
It's entirely unacceptable I
haven't been briefed about it.

12:14.234 --> 12:16.045
And I'm personally offended
for you, but before you go,

12:16.069 --> 12:18.105
I need the ignition code
to your rover and about

12:18.138 --> 12:19.572
a ten-minute
head start.

12:19.606 --> 12:21.975
No. I'm going with you.

12:22.009 --> 12:24.077
No, you're not.

12:24.111 --> 12:25.212
This a medical emergency.

12:25.245 --> 12:26.947
What are you going
to do without me?

12:26.980 --> 12:28.048
Shoot them back to health?

12:28.081 --> 12:30.683
Fine, but I'm drive...

12:30.717 --> 12:32.685
Oh, God, you have a cold.

12:32.719 --> 12:34.654
I have kids.
Here.

12:34.687 --> 12:36.023
Chew on this.

12:38.125 --> 12:40.027
I won't have you sneezing
on me the whole way.

12:40.060 --> 12:41.862
Chew it. You'll be good
for 12 hours.

12:41.895 --> 12:42.796
Oh, it tastes awful!

12:42.830 --> 12:45.098
Yeah, I know.

12:52.840 --> 12:55.108
Scoot over.

13:02.715 --> 13:06.920
Um... I've been meaning
to talk to you about something.

13:06.954 --> 13:11.158
Uh, remember that day,
out by the falls

13:11.191 --> 13:12.926
when you showed me
those calculations,

13:12.960 --> 13:14.627
or whatever they were?

13:16.029 --> 13:20.133
Don't you think
that we should, uh...

13:21.902 --> 13:23.670
...tell someone?

13:23.703 --> 13:27.140
Who?

13:29.609 --> 13:31.811
I don't know.

13:31.845 --> 13:34.147
I forget what
I was talking about.

13:52.165 --> 13:54.167
Skye?

13:59.006 --> 14:01.174
You know I like you.

14:01.208 --> 14:05.979
I'd be insane not to.

14:06.013 --> 14:08.848
Just the way
I left things with Kara...

14:08.882 --> 14:09.983
the way we said good-bye...

14:10.017 --> 14:12.119
I just, I can't. I'm sorry.

14:12.785 --> 14:15.188
It's okay.

14:16.689 --> 14:18.658
I get it.

14:18.691 --> 14:20.928
Oh. You hate me now.

14:20.961 --> 14:25.065
I do not hate you, Josh.

14:25.098 --> 14:28.135
You promised Kara you'd
try to get her here.

14:29.202 --> 14:32.105
What if I told you
I might know a guy

14:32.139 --> 14:36.143
who could help you with that?

14:48.355 --> 14:49.923
The hell's that?

14:50.723 --> 14:52.725
Ovosaurs. Damn it.

15:01.501 --> 15:04.671
I keep telling Taylor we
should sink these things deeper.

15:04.704 --> 15:05.973
It's the nickel.

15:06.006 --> 15:07.007
It's like catnip to them.

15:19.352 --> 15:21.154
Outpost Three,
this is Terra Nova.

15:21.188 --> 15:22.956
Come in, Commander Taylor.

15:29.262 --> 15:31.731
Outpost Three,
this is Terra Nova. Come in.

15:31.764 --> 15:32.632
Do you hear me?

15:32.665 --> 15:36.970
Outpost Three,
this is Terra Nova. Come in.

15:37.004 --> 15:38.972
Commander Taylor, are you there?

15:39.006 --> 15:40.773
Commander Taylor isn't here
right now.

15:40.807 --> 15:41.975
Can I take a message?

15:42.009 --> 15:43.977
What the hell are you
doing there?

15:44.011 --> 15:45.678
Well, uh,
I'm looking for my wife.

15:45.712 --> 15:47.014
Where's the commander?

15:47.047 --> 15:48.781
I don't know yet,
but I'll let you know

15:48.815 --> 15:50.017
as soon as I find out.

15:50.050 --> 15:51.684
Good talk. Over.
Shannon?

15:54.954 --> 15:56.189
Hi.

16:04.064 --> 16:06.633
Elisabeth.

16:06.666 --> 16:07.634
Don't move!

16:07.667 --> 16:10.503
Elisabeth, it's us.

16:10.537 --> 16:13.040
Malcolm?

16:13.073 --> 16:17.210
Malcolm, thank God
you're here!

16:29.956 --> 16:31.058
What the hell's going on?

16:31.091 --> 16:32.892
Why doesn't she recognize me?

16:32.925 --> 16:34.727
Okay, um...

16:34.761 --> 16:37.964
she seems to have lost
all memory of the last 20

16:37.997 --> 16:40.267
or so years.

16:40.300 --> 16:42.235
As far as
Elisabeth's concerned,

16:42.269 --> 16:44.137
she's in university,

16:44.171 --> 16:47.507
she and I have
just started dating.

16:47.540 --> 16:50.977
Oh, terrific... so, you're in,
the, uh, honeymoon period.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.879
Yeah.
Yeah.

16:52.912 --> 16:54.814
Malcolm, how did this happen?

16:54.847 --> 16:56.616
Some kind of pathogen.

16:56.649 --> 17:00.287
I looked at the notes she made
before she became symptomatic.

17:00.320 --> 17:02.122
Um, the first stage
of the disease

17:02.155 --> 17:03.990
is intermittent
memory loss.

17:04.022 --> 17:06.159
The infected become disoriented.

17:06.193 --> 17:08.428
They can hold on,
but with some effort.

17:08.461 --> 17:11.131
And they eventually
do become unmoored,

17:11.164 --> 17:13.233
which leads to stage two,

17:13.266 --> 17:15.667
which is, uh,
catastrophic memory loss.

17:15.702 --> 17:19.038
That could explain why we
can't find Taylor and Brady.

17:19.071 --> 17:20.473
According to Elisabeth's notes,

17:20.507 --> 17:24.977
the final stage of the disease
is full-on catatonia.

17:25.011 --> 17:26.979
Malcolm...

17:27.012 --> 17:29.015
can you cure this thing?

17:29.048 --> 17:31.151
With her help,
I-I believe so.

17:31.184 --> 17:33.186
I mean, she's
still Elisabeth.

17:33.220 --> 17:35.122
Her cognitive mind
is still functioning,

17:35.155 --> 17:37.557
and even as a student,
she was amazing.

17:37.590 --> 17:41.828
We just need to bring her up to
the present as fast as possible.

17:41.861 --> 17:44.063
Okay.

17:44.097 --> 17:45.432
Guess I better
introduce myself.

17:45.465 --> 17:47.100
Um, actually,
you know what?

17:47.134 --> 17:48.777
It would probably be
better if I do the talking.

17:48.801 --> 17:51.204
I mean, we just need to
give her enough information

17:51.238 --> 17:53.106
to get her back to work.

17:53.140 --> 17:55.041
You throw a husband and
kids at her right now,

17:55.074 --> 17:55.975
it'll just confuse her.

17:56.008 --> 17:57.277
So, you're going to tell her

17:57.310 --> 17:59.112
it's 20 years later
than she thinks it is,

17:59.146 --> 18:00.789
and she's gone back
in time 85 million years,

18:00.813 --> 18:02.582
but you think a husband's
gonna confuse her?

18:02.615 --> 18:04.651
Look, she doesn't
remember who you are.

18:04.684 --> 18:07.620
You want to break out the
family album, be my guest.

18:07.654 --> 18:10.022
I'm just trying to
be efficient. Fine.

18:10.056 --> 18:12.058
We'll do it your way.

18:12.091 --> 18:14.194
Okay, uh, Elisabeth,

18:14.227 --> 18:16.229
this is Jim Shannon.

18:16.263 --> 18:18.565
He's with security.

18:21.067 --> 18:23.170
Pleased to meet you.

18:30.009 --> 18:31.344
Hey, Tom.
Skye.

18:31.378 --> 18:33.713
Hey, uh, you got a minute?

18:33.746 --> 18:34.881
Yeah.

18:34.914 --> 18:36.549
Um, I told Josh

18:36.583 --> 18:40.086
you're a man
who can get things here.

18:40.119 --> 18:43.223
Well, I've done so
in the past.

18:43.256 --> 18:45.158
Or the future, I should say.

18:46.926 --> 18:48.127
People, too?

18:48.161 --> 18:49.196
People?

18:49.229 --> 18:51.030
People is difficult.

18:51.063 --> 18:52.765
And expensive.

18:52.799 --> 18:54.334
How expensive?

18:54.367 --> 18:57.003
More than a kid your
age could afford.

18:57.036 --> 18:58.571
Well, I've got time to earn,

18:58.605 --> 18:59.682
and this couldn't
happen until

18:59.706 --> 19:00.949
at least the pilgrimage
after next, right?

19:00.973 --> 19:03.376
Because you would have to get
a message through to 2149,

19:03.410 --> 19:05.221
and that could only happen
when the portals open.

19:05.245 --> 19:09.482
Or so Taylor says.

19:13.286 --> 19:15.822
Your the cop's son, right?

19:18.157 --> 19:20.493
'Cause, uh...

19:21.494 --> 19:23.963
...trust is important
around here,

19:23.996 --> 19:26.266
so, theoretically,

19:26.299 --> 19:28.501
if a person had secrets,

19:28.535 --> 19:31.170
would they be safe with you?

19:33.005 --> 19:35.942
Why, are we theoretically having
a job interview right now?

19:41.648 --> 19:44.917
85 million BC?

19:44.951 --> 19:48.020
You people couldn't time travel
to after the Ice Age?

19:48.054 --> 19:49.722
Uh, it's too complicated.

19:49.756 --> 19:50.890
Okay.

19:50.923 --> 19:53.826
The important thing is
that you came to this outpost

19:53.860 --> 19:58.164
and identified a pathogen that
causes some kind of amnesia.

19:58.197 --> 19:59.399
And it's affecting
you, too.

19:59.432 --> 20:01.200
You don't
believe me?

20:01.234 --> 20:02.669
Well, of course I don't

20:02.702 --> 20:05.104
because what you're talking
about is completely ridiculous.

20:05.137 --> 20:10.109
If you don't believe him,

20:10.142 --> 20:12.645
maybe you'll believe yourself.

20:18.885 --> 20:21.321
The incubation period is
approximately four to six hours.

20:21.354 --> 20:23.623
Early symptoms include

20:23.656 --> 20:26.493
disorientation,
loss of short-term memory.

20:26.526 --> 20:29.362
It appears to involve
cognitive regression

20:29.396 --> 20:31.264
to a point
in the patient's history,

20:31.298 --> 20:32.799
in their past...

20:32.832 --> 20:34.967
I'm so old. No, you're
not. You're beautiful.

20:35.001 --> 20:37.804
And the disease appears to reach
its third and final stage

20:37.837 --> 20:39.706
within 36 to 48 hours.

20:39.739 --> 20:43.843
It remains to be seen whether
the catatonia is reversible.

20:46.879 --> 20:48.848
Okay.

20:50.550 --> 20:52.752
How long have I been here?

20:52.785 --> 20:53.853
A little over a day.

20:53.886 --> 20:57.724
Then we need to figure this out
before I get any worse

20:57.757 --> 21:00.327
and before you two
start showing any symptoms.

21:03.363 --> 21:04.297
What's happening?

21:04.331 --> 21:06.466
Ovosaurs

21:06.499 --> 21:08.401
chewing on power
cables. Could be.

21:08.435 --> 21:11.738
All right, I'll go
chase 'em off.

22:16.369 --> 22:18.671
Brady?

22:55.007 --> 22:58.010
Move a muscle,
I'll blow your head off.

23:10.089 --> 23:11.958
James Shannon.

23:11.991 --> 23:15.595
Terra Nova Security.

23:17.063 --> 23:19.098
What's Terra Nova? Huh?

23:19.131 --> 23:21.067
This place?

23:21.100 --> 23:23.436
Uh... not exactly.

23:23.470 --> 23:25.838
It's a code name,
isn't it?

23:25.872 --> 23:28.641
Is that what you're calling
this operation, Terra Nova?

23:28.675 --> 23:31.277
Taylor, listen to me,
I don't know when or where

23:31.310 --> 23:33.279
you think you are...
Save it.

23:33.312 --> 23:35.381
I know exactly
where I am.

23:35.414 --> 23:37.684
Somalia. 2138.

23:37.717 --> 23:41.954
What are you talking about? Only question
is, who's running this mind game on me?

23:41.988 --> 23:43.790
I know the Somalis
ain't got the tech

23:43.823 --> 23:45.592
to get inside
my head like this.

23:45.625 --> 23:48.027
That means you are
either Axis psi-ops,

23:48.060 --> 23:49.261
or you're Russo-Chinese.

23:49.295 --> 23:50.830
I'll figure it out.

23:50.863 --> 23:52.899
And then I'll know
who took her.

23:52.932 --> 23:55.468
What do you mean, her?
You mean Wash?

23:55.502 --> 23:57.403
You're a liar.

23:57.436 --> 23:59.906
I was there when they
medevac'd her out.

23:59.939 --> 24:03.409
There's no way
she's in on this.

24:03.442 --> 24:04.844
Where's Ayani?

24:04.877 --> 24:07.079
Where did they take her?
Who?

24:07.113 --> 24:09.081
My wife.

24:09.982 --> 24:12.084
My son.

24:12.118 --> 24:14.020
Taylor...

24:14.053 --> 24:15.922
I saw those people
strapped in back,

24:15.955 --> 24:17.690
the ones you're
experimenting on.

24:17.724 --> 24:20.126
You're lucky I didn't
find my family there,

24:20.159 --> 24:23.162
and you better pray
that I do find them.

24:24.897 --> 24:28.467
If I don't, I'm
gonna come back...

24:28.501 --> 24:31.571
and I'm gonna slit
every throat in sight.

24:34.006 --> 24:35.708
Count on it.

24:36.142 --> 24:38.578
Malcolm.

24:40.747 --> 24:44.450
Look at the DNA sequencing
on this blood sample.

24:44.483 --> 24:45.828
This isn't a pathogen
we're dealing with.

24:45.852 --> 24:49.021
Someone in this lab was
experimenting with gene therapy.

24:49.055 --> 24:50.623
No, no, no, no,
that's impossible.

24:50.657 --> 24:52.234
Any research involving
genetic manipulation

24:52.258 --> 24:53.926
has to be cleared
through me.

24:53.960 --> 24:55.562
Well, then, so,
whoever it is,

24:55.595 --> 24:58.297
is obviously trying
to keep it a secret.

24:58.330 --> 25:00.399
You're so beautiful.
What?

25:00.432 --> 25:03.302
Let's get lost today, hmm?

25:03.335 --> 25:05.772
Malcolm, hey, look at
me. I am looking at you.

25:05.805 --> 25:07.073
I can't help but look at you.

25:07.106 --> 25:08.708
This doesn't feel right,
Malcolm. Please.

25:08.741 --> 25:10.276
Yeah, Malcolm. Please.

25:11.778 --> 25:14.547
Jack! What are you doing?

25:14.581 --> 25:16.082
He's been infected!

25:16.115 --> 25:18.050
No, no, I-I'm fine.
I'm-I'm fine now.

25:18.084 --> 25:21.621
I-I-I just drifted,
but I'm-I'm-I'm okay.

25:23.155 --> 25:25.057
Where are you?

25:25.091 --> 25:26.325
Uh, Terra Nova.

25:26.358 --> 25:27.994
Research outpost.

25:28.027 --> 25:30.630
If you can remember
that, remember this.

25:30.663 --> 25:33.866
That's my wife... so keep
your hands to yourself.

25:37.303 --> 25:40.172
What happened to you?

25:42.875 --> 25:45.945
Uh... I found Taylor.

25:45.978 --> 25:47.218
He's infected.
He thinks he's in

25:47.246 --> 25:49.481
some kind of psi-ops SIM
back in Somalia.

25:49.515 --> 25:51.851
I know he served there.
They did some

25:51.884 --> 25:53.829
horrible psychological
experiments during that war.

25:53.853 --> 25:56.088
And if that's
the last thing he remembers,

25:56.122 --> 25:59.058
then everything he's seeing now
doesn't make much sense to him,

25:59.091 --> 26:01.728
just like it didn't to Elisabeth
when we first found her.

26:01.761 --> 26:03.996
He's trying to make his
way back to Terra Nova.

26:04.030 --> 26:05.431
He'll find it.
He's motivated...

26:05.464 --> 26:07.433
He thinks his wife's in
danger. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

26:07.466 --> 26:09.936
If he makes it back to the
colony, he'll infect everyone.

26:09.969 --> 26:12.171
Which is why we need
to warn them... except we can't.

26:12.204 --> 26:14.340
Com-system went out
when we lost power.

26:14.373 --> 26:16.075
- You have to follow him.
- No, no, no,

26:16.108 --> 26:18.177
we have to assume
Jack's been infected, too.

26:18.210 --> 26:19.245
Uh, Jim.
It's-it's Jim.

26:19.278 --> 26:21.013
And no,
I feel fine.

26:21.047 --> 26:22.649
Well, so did he
five minutes ago.

26:22.682 --> 26:25.184
Have you experienced
any disorientation at all

26:25.217 --> 26:27.053
since you've been here?

26:27.086 --> 26:28.688
Um... no.

26:28.721 --> 26:29.789
That's curious.

26:29.822 --> 26:31.991
The two of you were exposed
at the same time,

26:32.024 --> 26:34.794
so why aren't you showing
any symptoms? I don't know.

26:34.827 --> 26:38.497
But Taylor did a job on
that soldier Brady back there,

26:38.530 --> 26:40.466
so I'm gonna get him
to the infirmary,

26:40.499 --> 26:42.034
so you can check he's okay.

26:42.068 --> 26:44.236
Okay, we'll get
back to work.

26:45.204 --> 26:46.973
Okay...
Yeah...

26:47.006 --> 26:49.341
Actually, uh, why don't
you come give me a hand.

26:49.375 --> 26:51.043
This guy's not small.

26:51.077 --> 26:53.245
Oh. Okay, yeah.

26:53.279 --> 26:55.247
I'll, um...
Take care.

26:56.716 --> 26:58.150
This...?
Yeah.

26:58.184 --> 27:00.152
Okay.

27:04.223 --> 27:05.524
Hey.

27:05.557 --> 27:06.993
Mark.

27:07.026 --> 27:08.627
Oh, I'm so sorry.
No...

27:08.661 --> 27:09.962
I totally forgot.
I wanted...

27:09.996 --> 27:11.774
I thought that we knew
that it was canceled tonight

27:11.798 --> 27:13.108
because my parents are
missing and I'm...

27:13.132 --> 27:15.301
No, I just came to check
if you were okay.

27:15.334 --> 27:16.669
Are you okay?

27:16.703 --> 27:18.137
You know what the worst part is?

27:18.170 --> 27:20.206
Having absolutely no idea
what's going on.

27:20.239 --> 27:21.640
All my dad said was

27:21.674 --> 27:23.042
he was going to help my mom,

27:23.075 --> 27:24.486
and then nothing
from either of them.

27:24.510 --> 27:26.478
Yeah, that's rough.

27:26.512 --> 27:28.014
It could be
anything, you know?

27:28.047 --> 27:29.257
Sixers could have ambushed them.

27:29.281 --> 27:31.050
It's not the Sixers.

27:31.083 --> 27:34.253
Then you know what's going on.

27:34.286 --> 27:36.122
Look, Maddy, I'm really...

27:36.155 --> 27:38.290
not supposed to be
talking about this.

27:39.191 --> 27:40.292
Mark...

27:41.493 --> 27:44.296
...it's my parents.

28:05.284 --> 28:07.319
No way.

28:11.958 --> 28:14.894
Of all the times you could
have flashed back to,

28:14.927 --> 28:15.962
did it have to be

28:15.995 --> 28:18.097
when you were dating my wife?
I just saw Elizabeth

28:18.130 --> 28:20.275
in a laboratory and my mind
must have filled in the rest.

28:20.299 --> 28:23.302
What do you want me to say?
Uh, that it won't happen again.

28:23.335 --> 28:25.404
It won't happen again.

28:27.373 --> 28:28.707
What?

28:28.741 --> 28:29.441
Oh, my God.

28:29.475 --> 28:31.243
Who is this?

28:31.277 --> 28:33.312
Who are you?

28:33.345 --> 28:35.047
Oh, God, what now?

28:36.615 --> 28:40.619
D-D-Di-Did we, uh,
kill this man?

28:40.652 --> 28:42.188
No, he's not even dead.

28:43.322 --> 28:44.490
See?

28:44.523 --> 28:45.958
So come on,
give me a hand.

28:45.992 --> 28:49.495
I-I-I don't want any trouble.
I'm here on a grant.

28:49.528 --> 28:51.497
Come on, just
pick up his legs.

28:54.533 --> 28:58.437
Malcolm... uh...

28:58.470 --> 29:01.808
Malcolm, move!

29:18.925 --> 29:21.093
Those are the ugliest
dogs I've ever seen.

29:21.127 --> 29:23.429
Hey, maybe they'll
just eat that solider

29:23.462 --> 29:25.431
and go away.

29:25.464 --> 29:27.499
Stay here.

29:28.467 --> 29:30.236
What are you doing?

29:44.516 --> 29:47.586
The nickel in the cables!
They can smell it!

29:47.619 --> 29:49.021
Clear the door.
What?

29:49.055 --> 29:50.522
Get out of the way!

29:53.459 --> 29:55.527
Go! Go!

30:03.602 --> 30:04.871
Oh, dear God,
somebody help me.

30:04.904 --> 30:06.581
Malcolm... What the
hell were those things?

30:06.605 --> 30:08.140
Calm down, Malcolm.

30:13.045 --> 30:15.581
What did
you just do?

30:15.614 --> 30:19.018
Uh, I... No choice.

30:20.686 --> 30:24.290
So where are we
on this cure?

30:25.557 --> 30:27.493
Nowhere. I mean...

30:27.526 --> 30:29.371
I really felt like we
were making some progress,

30:29.395 --> 30:31.797
but I can't do this
without Malcolm.

30:31.830 --> 30:33.565
You don't need Malcolm.

30:35.034 --> 30:37.036
You were doing just fine
before he got here.

30:37.069 --> 30:40.172
No, I was cowering in the corner
with a rifle.

30:40.206 --> 30:43.275
You were confused and alone,
but you're not anymore.

30:48.915 --> 30:50.582
Do we know each other?

30:50.616 --> 30:55.521
Yeah, we do.

30:55.554 --> 31:00.092
We come from the same place...
The future.

31:04.396 --> 31:09.335
But we're more than just
acquaintances, aren't we?

31:09.368 --> 31:10.702
We're friends.

31:10.736 --> 31:13.973
Yeah, we are.

31:16.408 --> 31:18.244
All right.

31:19.645 --> 31:21.713
Uh, okay.

31:21.747 --> 31:25.017
So we know somebody
in this lab

31:25.051 --> 31:26.895
was conducting illicit
gene therapy experiments.

31:26.919 --> 31:28.820
Now, if I knew who that was,

31:28.854 --> 31:31.323
I might be able to figure out
what they were trying to do,

31:31.357 --> 31:33.859
and then that might help me
work out how to undo it.

31:33.892 --> 31:36.895
Yeah, suspect and motive.
Now you're talking my language.

31:36.929 --> 31:38.597
Okay, so we need
to start going through

31:38.630 --> 31:39.765
the staff's personal files.

31:39.798 --> 31:42.001
Um... how are you at
computer hacking?

31:42.034 --> 31:44.070
Uh, Maddy's taught me
a thing or two.

31:44.103 --> 31:46.005
Maddy?
Yeah.

31:46.038 --> 31:47.206
My daughter.

31:47.239 --> 31:50.076
Oh, you have a daughter.

31:50.109 --> 31:52.044
So, you married?

31:52.078 --> 31:55.514
Yeah. Well, you know,
it's complicated.

31:55.547 --> 31:57.716
Isn't it always.

31:57.749 --> 32:02.254
Okay, let's get to hacking.

32:30.516 --> 32:34.220
♪

32:53.305 --> 32:54.806
I think I got something.

32:54.840 --> 32:56.675
Whose computer terminal is it?

32:56.708 --> 32:59.278
Dr. Douglas Joslyn.

32:59.311 --> 33:02.348
Okay, let's bring up
his medical history.

33:05.517 --> 33:08.254
He carries the latent gene
for Gormon's Disease.

33:08.287 --> 33:10.956
Gormon's... that's kind of
like Alzheimer's, right?

33:10.989 --> 33:13.092
Yeah, only worse.

33:13.125 --> 33:14.760
He must have been
looking for a cure,

33:14.793 --> 33:16.128
trying to resequence

33:16.162 --> 33:17.205
the gene cluster
that controls memory.

33:17.229 --> 33:18.464
The resequencing

33:18.497 --> 33:20.899
must have misfired, started
blocking the neural pathways

33:20.932 --> 33:22.068
instead of
opening them up.

33:22.101 --> 33:24.070
He must have
engineered a virus

33:24.103 --> 33:26.004
to use as a delivery system,

33:26.038 --> 33:29.875
but then that's how
it became contagious.

33:29.908 --> 33:30.876
I'm not sure
of anything anymore,

33:30.909 --> 33:32.087
and we're running out of time.

33:32.111 --> 33:33.712
Elisabeth,
you can do this.

33:33.745 --> 33:35.047
No, I'm at 39 hours.

33:35.081 --> 33:37.083
Catatonia can set in
as early as 36.

33:37.116 --> 33:38.817
All right, so we work fast.

33:38.850 --> 33:40.886
Okay?
Okay.

33:40.919 --> 33:42.888
Okay...

33:42.921 --> 33:45.224
Just give me
something to do.

33:49.561 --> 33:51.530
Elisabeth?

33:54.166 --> 33:56.068
This is my handwriting,

33:56.102 --> 33:57.936
but I don't remember
writing these and I-I-I,

33:57.969 --> 34:00.139
I don't know who they are.

34:01.140 --> 34:02.641
But if I wrote them down,

34:02.674 --> 34:04.976
it must be because...
because they're important to me

34:05.010 --> 34:07.313
and I was afraid
I was going to forget.

34:08.580 --> 34:10.248
Josh.

34:11.882 --> 34:14.253
Maddy.

34:15.887 --> 34:18.123
That's your daughter's name.

34:26.398 --> 34:27.533
Zoe...

34:32.704 --> 34:35.072
Jim.

34:36.942 --> 34:38.844
Your husband.

34:42.880 --> 34:44.815
I don't remember.

34:44.850 --> 34:48.154
I know.

34:48.887 --> 34:51.157
But you will.

34:51.889 --> 34:53.992
What if I don't?

34:54.025 --> 34:56.728
What happens if we both forget?

34:56.762 --> 35:01.867
What I feel for you is...
is more than just a memory.

35:07.005 --> 35:11.109
Anyway... I'm fine.

35:14.846 --> 35:18.584
Yeah, you are, aren't you?

35:18.617 --> 35:21.086
Why is that?

35:21.119 --> 35:22.221
Why?

35:24.956 --> 35:26.858
Oh, sorry.

35:26.892 --> 35:28.927
So much for 12 hours.

35:28.960 --> 35:29.995
What's that?

35:30.028 --> 35:31.563
Oh, it's something
Malcolm gave me

35:31.597 --> 35:33.699
for my cold.

35:33.732 --> 35:35.967
This is it.

35:36.001 --> 35:37.269
It has to be.

35:37.303 --> 35:39.046
There's something in this
that he's given you

35:39.070 --> 35:40.772
that has a
medicinal quality

35:40.806 --> 35:41.873
that blocks the pathogen.

35:41.907 --> 35:43.108
I mean,

35:43.141 --> 35:44.843
all we have to do is
work out what it is.

35:44.876 --> 35:46.845
I'm not sure this is
such a good idea, Maddy.

35:46.878 --> 35:48.780
Look, nobody said that
you had to come with me.

35:48.814 --> 35:49.881
Either way I'm going in

35:49.915 --> 35:52.951
and I'm asking Lieutenant
Washington what's going on.

35:52.984 --> 35:54.186
L-Look,
what about Zoe?

35:54.220 --> 35:55.954
Okay? We can't just
leave her alone.

35:55.987 --> 35:56.855
How is she alone?

35:56.888 --> 35:58.924
You posted two guards
outside her bedroom.

35:58.957 --> 36:00.192
Uh, yeah, about that,

36:00.226 --> 36:02.328
if you wouldn't mind
not mentioning that

36:02.361 --> 36:05.931
to my commanding officer,
I'd really appreciate it.

36:05.964 --> 36:06.998
Lieutenant Washington?

36:07.032 --> 36:07.999
It's Maddy Shannon.

36:08.033 --> 36:10.936
I'd like to speak to you.

36:10.969 --> 36:11.970
Look, Maddy...

36:12.003 --> 36:14.072
Lieutenant Washington.

36:14.105 --> 36:15.116
Not now, Maddy.
My parents...

36:15.140 --> 36:16.842
Reynolds, get her
out of here... now!

36:16.875 --> 36:18.777
Lieutenant, a-all she...
That was an order!

36:21.513 --> 36:23.949
You're not too good
at following orders,

36:23.982 --> 36:25.417
are you, soldier?

36:32.057 --> 36:33.759
You're sick, Commander.

36:33.792 --> 36:34.802
You've been infected
with something,

36:34.826 --> 36:35.794
it's got you confused.

36:35.827 --> 36:37.996
The war... it's over.

36:38.029 --> 36:39.998
Has been for a decade.

36:40.031 --> 36:41.032
We won.

36:41.066 --> 36:42.901
Don't you lie to me, Wash.

36:42.934 --> 36:44.736
I want answers.

36:44.770 --> 36:46.672
Please...!

36:46.705 --> 36:48.274
You don't want
to do that, sir.

36:48.307 --> 36:50.776
He's a soldier
he's one of your men.

36:50.809 --> 36:52.578
His name is Reynolds,
Mark Reynolds.

36:52.611 --> 36:54.021
He came out here
on the Fifth Pilgrimage.

36:54.045 --> 36:55.747
He came here because of you,

36:55.781 --> 36:59.285
because seven years ago,
you led us to this place...

37:01.353 --> 37:04.590
...so that we could have
a second chance.

37:07.025 --> 37:09.695
What is this place?

37:12.798 --> 37:14.032
It's home.

37:14.065 --> 37:16.234
This is home?

37:16.268 --> 37:17.436
Yeah.

37:19.471 --> 37:22.574
All right, then
where is my wife?

37:23.775 --> 37:24.576
Show her to me.

37:24.610 --> 37:26.945
Ayani's gone, Nathaniel.

37:26.978 --> 37:28.814
No.

37:28.847 --> 37:29.981
She died.

37:30.015 --> 37:31.650
No, you're lying to me, Wash.

37:31.683 --> 37:34.886
You know I would never lie
to you about anything.

37:34.920 --> 37:39.090
This is your place,
this is your home,

37:39.124 --> 37:40.426
and you've forgotten,
that's all,

37:40.459 --> 37:42.994
but we're going to help you
find a way to remember.

37:43.028 --> 37:45.564
Ayani's dead.

37:45.597 --> 37:48.033
Yeah.

37:51.837 --> 37:53.872
Why would I want
to remember that?

37:53.905 --> 37:54.905
No, sir.
No!

38:00.078 --> 38:04.550
Natural antihistamines,
traces of animal dung.

38:04.583 --> 38:07.218
No, there's nothing in that
root that Malcolm gave you

38:07.252 --> 38:08.854
that would account
for you being immune.

38:08.887 --> 38:09.888
Animal dung?

38:09.921 --> 38:11.823
Yeah.

38:14.360 --> 38:16.462
You want it back?

38:16.495 --> 38:20.298
Oh, I'd rather sneeze, but
I don't want to get you sick,

38:20.332 --> 38:21.667
so...

38:21.700 --> 38:22.634
Yes, you do.

38:22.668 --> 38:24.470
What?
I'm such an idiot.

38:24.503 --> 38:25.937
It's not this root,
it's your cold.

38:25.971 --> 38:26.805
My cold?

38:26.838 --> 38:28.374
Yeah, your virus
is counteracting

38:28.407 --> 38:29.841
the one that
Joslyn engineered.

38:29.875 --> 38:31.309
It's blocking the
cell receptors

38:31.343 --> 38:32.554
so the pathogen
can't get through.

38:32.578 --> 38:35.080
All I have to do is
identify the serotype

38:35.113 --> 38:39.217
and we should be able to
manufacture a treatment.

38:39.250 --> 38:43.154
Uh, I-I-I think
I know a faster way.

38:58.169 --> 39:00.539
You feel sick yet?

39:00.572 --> 39:03.575
Not quite yet, no.

39:11.683 --> 39:13.151
Okay, take it easy.

39:13.184 --> 39:15.053
Take it easy,
Commander.

39:16.455 --> 39:18.790
Can you tell me where you are?

39:21.326 --> 39:23.695
Terra Nova.

39:26.432 --> 39:28.434
You're going to
experience some confusion,

39:28.467 --> 39:29.401
just for a few hours,

39:29.435 --> 39:31.603
while the memories
sort themselves out.

39:31.637 --> 39:33.472
Based on the success
we had at the outpost,

39:33.505 --> 39:35.340
you should be fine
before dinner.

39:35.373 --> 39:37.976
Except for a wicked cold, right?

39:38.009 --> 39:41.480
No, well, I created a vaccine
out of an inactive virus,

39:41.513 --> 39:43.515
so you shouldn't
exhibit any symptoms.

39:43.549 --> 39:45.617
All right, we'll
let you rest.

39:48.219 --> 39:50.188
Lieutenant.

39:50.221 --> 39:52.323
Yes, sir.

39:52.357 --> 39:55.326
You shot me.

39:55.360 --> 39:57.663
I did, sir.

39:58.363 --> 40:00.666
Good job.

40:05.370 --> 40:07.639
Thank you.

40:07.673 --> 40:08.707
How are you feeling?

40:08.740 --> 40:11.276
Hey, Elisabeth,
yeah, I'm fine,

40:11.309 --> 40:12.611
except for this headache.

40:12.644 --> 40:15.213
I must have taken
a fall or something.

40:15.246 --> 40:18.016
Or something.

40:28.359 --> 40:30.696
Okay.

40:33.264 --> 40:35.200
Mr. Shannon.

40:45.611 --> 40:47.946
Don't mind me.

40:54.586 --> 40:56.855
Hi, angel.

40:56.888 --> 40:58.524
Hi, Daddy.

40:58.557 --> 41:00.325
Feeling better?

41:00.358 --> 41:02.093
Yeah.

41:02.127 --> 41:03.127
Yeah.

41:05.731 --> 41:07.633
What have you got here?

41:07.866 --> 41:08.867
Dinosaurs.

41:08.900 --> 41:10.802
Dinosaurs?

41:10.836 --> 41:12.437
Hey.

41:12.470 --> 41:14.039
Hey.

41:14.072 --> 41:15.674
Come in here
and hide with us.

41:19.645 --> 41:21.412
Look what Z made.

41:21.446 --> 41:24.382
I'm teaching them
how to walk.

41:24.415 --> 41:26.251
How they doing?

41:26.284 --> 41:27.953
Pretty well.

41:28.720 --> 41:31.256
We should enjoy
this while we can.

41:31.289 --> 41:33.825
Yeah.
Yeah.

41:47.338 --> 41:49.708
How are you, Mira?

41:56.181 --> 41:59.017
Medicine, power cell...

41:59.050 --> 42:01.820
No ammo?

42:01.853 --> 42:03.121
Taylor would lock me up

42:03.154 --> 42:05.857
if he even knew I was doing
business with the Sixers.

42:05.891 --> 42:10.195
If he thought I was getting you
weapons, he'd have me shot.

42:12.030 --> 42:14.299
I was able to find you
more of that wild sorghum

42:14.332 --> 42:16.267
you're so keen on.

42:20.371 --> 42:22.540
Good as gold.

42:22.574 --> 42:25.276
This stuff makes
the finest hooch.

42:27.278 --> 42:30.048
Just one more thing.

42:30.081 --> 42:34.552
The next time you're able
to establish contact with 2149,

42:34.586 --> 42:36.822
I need to get a message through.

42:37.689 --> 42:39.991
What's it about?

42:40.759 --> 42:43.128
Ah, it's just a kid
who wants to buy

42:43.161 --> 42:44.863
his girlfriend's way
through the portal.

42:45.764 --> 42:47.365
You going soft?

42:47.398 --> 42:49.267
The kid...

42:49.300 --> 42:52.070
He's our new sheriff's son.

42:53.171 --> 42:56.041
You mean Shannon?

42:56.074 --> 42:57.342
That's right.

42:57.375 --> 42:59.778
I gave his boy
a job in my bar.

42:59.811 --> 43:04.482
You know, keep your enemies
close and all that?

43:04.515 --> 43:06.752
But, I mean,
if it's a problem,

43:06.785 --> 43:08.820
I can tell him
I just couldn't work it out.

43:08.854 --> 43:10.288
It's not a problem.

43:10.321 --> 43:11.356
It's an opportunity.

43:12.457 --> 43:14.793
One I plan to take
advantage of.
