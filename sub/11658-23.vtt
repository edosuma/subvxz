A few more snacks like that,

01:00.133 --> 01:02.533
and the only thing
you'll fit into is a saddle.

01:03.200 --> 01:05.900
I won't eat all this at once.

01:05.967 --> 01:08.700
There's an <i>I love Lucy</i> marathon.

01:08.767 --> 01:11.900
I'm setting up for 12 hours
of classic TV.

01:11.967 --> 01:13.633
I never cared for it.

01:13.700 --> 01:16.767
Every single episode,
Lucy said the same thing,

01:16.834 --> 01:20.734
"Ricky, why can't I be in the show?"

01:20.800 --> 01:22.633
Why couldn't she be in the show?

01:22.700 --> 01:24.133
The woman was a riot at home.

01:24.200 --> 01:26.367
His show at the club Stank.

01:28.100 --> 01:30.867
What's so entertaining about
a Cuban beating a drum?

01:31.767 --> 01:34.367
Rose, there's an
<i>I love Lucy </i>marathon on tonight.

01:34.433 --> 01:35.934
Want to watch it?

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
That sounds great.
Who's in it?

01:41.066 --> 01:42.700
Who's in it?

01:42.767 --> 01:45.066
Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz and...

01:45.600 --> 01:47.533
the Ricardos. The Mertzes.

01:48.033 --> 01:50.633
Oh, don't tell me you never saw
<i>I love Lucy.</i>

01:50.700 --> 01:54.533
No. I never watched much TV.

01:54.600 --> 01:56.767
Charlie and I
never even had a television.

01:56.834 --> 01:58.266
We talked about getting one,

01:58.333 --> 02:00.700
but Charlie said
it wasn't perfected yet.

02:02.500 --> 02:06.133
Sounds like to me Charlie
was a little on the cheap side.

02:06.200 --> 02:07.266
I'll say.

02:07.333 --> 02:09.767
Charlie was a wonderful man,

02:09.834 --> 02:12.967
but he could squeeze a nickel
till the buffalo pooped.

02:15.900 --> 02:17.166
Boy, I'll tell you.

02:17.233 --> 02:19.633
There's something to
the power of suggestion.

02:19.700 --> 02:20.967
Excuse me.

02:28.300 --> 02:31.967
Would you like to watch
<i>I like Lucy?</i>

02:32.033 --> 02:33.200
<i>I love Lucy.</i>

02:33.266 --> 02:35.767
I haven't seen it.
I don't know how I feel about it.

02:36.900 --> 02:40.133
I won't have time
with my daughter coming.

02:40.200 --> 02:42.433
We'll spend our time
talking about...

02:43.633 --> 02:44.734
nothing.

02:45.567 --> 02:47.467
Nothing?
What's the nothing?

02:47.533 --> 02:49.834
The nothing is... nothing.

02:49.900 --> 02:52.467
If it were something,
I'd call it something.

02:52.533 --> 02:54.633
There are more important
things to talk about.

02:54.700 --> 02:55.734
Is that rumaki?

02:55.800 --> 02:58.233
You're keeping a secret from us.

02:58.300 --> 03:02.100
I can't believe it. I tell you everything.
I told you a secret last night.

03:02.166 --> 03:04.033
That you're not
naturally blonde?

03:04.100 --> 03:06.500
I am a natural blonde.

03:06.567 --> 03:09.000
Right, Rose. You and Tina Turner.

03:10.500 --> 03:13.100
Did Dorothy tell you she's going
to be a grandma?

03:13.166 --> 03:16.266
Oh, Ma! That was a secret.

03:16.333 --> 03:20.900
-Why didn't you tell us?
-We're not 100% sure.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
I didn't talk to Kate. Ma did.

03:23.066 --> 03:24.834
I know what I heard.

03:24.900 --> 03:29.233
She said she had news,
and then she had to throw up.

03:30.400 --> 03:31.700
Call me Kreskin.

03:33.133 --> 03:36.033
She and Dennis
have been trying to have children.

03:36.100 --> 03:38.200
Dorothy, this is so exciting.

03:38.266 --> 03:40.667
But, honey, we're not sure yet.

03:40.734 --> 03:42.700
-(doorbell rings)
-Oh, that's Kate.

03:42.767 --> 03:46.934
Oh, I am so nervous.
I'm also very excited.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
I've dreamed
about this moment all my life.

03:50.066 --> 03:52.300
-Oh, honey!
-Darling!

03:55.567 --> 03:59.233
Is it my imagination,
or was that my ex-husband Stan?

03:59.300 --> 04:03.100
Dorothy,
it's me, your ex-husband Stan.

04:03.166 --> 04:06.767
With that new toupee,
I thought you were Ted Danson.

04:10.266 --> 04:11.567
I got it today.

04:11.633 --> 04:14.000
It hasn't had time to settle.

04:14.066 --> 04:15.900
Wow, is that rumaki?

04:15.967 --> 04:18.533
-What are you doing here?
-I came to see Kate.

04:18.600 --> 04:21.600
-Oh, she hasn't gotten here yet.
-How did you know?

04:21.667 --> 04:23.433
She left a message.

04:23.500 --> 04:24.567
I was in Lauderdale.

04:24.633 --> 04:27.000
Oh, of course, I forgot.
It's spring break.

04:28.133 --> 04:29.567
You know why she's coming?

04:29.633 --> 04:30.834
No.

04:30.900 --> 04:32.767
<i>♪ Look at Dorothy's nose grow ♪</i>

04:32.834 --> 04:34.233
Oh, shut up, Rose.

04:35.533 --> 04:37.700
The Yutz should know.

04:37.767 --> 04:39.967
What should the Yutz know?

04:40.467 --> 04:41.834
We're not sure,

04:41.900 --> 04:45.333
but we think Kate
may be pregnant.

04:45.400 --> 04:49.033
Wow. That's incredible!
That makes me--

04:49.100 --> 04:51.200
A Yutz.
Some things never change.

04:52.800 --> 04:55.433
You're going to be
a granddaddy, Stanley.

04:55.500 --> 04:58.333
Wow, isn't life a gas?

04:58.834 --> 05:00.367
This is amazing.

05:04.233 --> 05:05.500
Excuse me again.

05:11.200 --> 05:14.967
I can't believe it.
I am going to be a grandfather.

05:15.033 --> 05:19.266
Part of me will be
passed on to that child.

05:19.333 --> 05:21.266
Well, I'm sure
we'll learn to love it anyway.

05:21.333 --> 05:23.567
(doorbell rings)

05:25.567 --> 05:28.834
-Oh, Mom!
-Kate, honey!

05:30.400 --> 05:32.867
-Hello, princess.
-Daddy.

05:32.934 --> 05:35.300
It's good to see you again.

05:35.367 --> 05:37.333
You look wonderful.

05:37.400 --> 05:40.266
I guess you have
big news for us.

05:40.333 --> 05:42.834
Rose, why don't we
give them their privacy?

05:42.900 --> 05:47.100
Don't go. You're family.
You can hear this.

05:47.166 --> 05:48.967
I knew it. I knew it.

05:49.033 --> 05:50.333
I just knew it.

05:50.400 --> 05:53.433
Oh, Stanley,
I'm so happy.

05:53.934 --> 05:56.433
Dennis had an affair,
and I've left him.

05:58.467 --> 06:00.567
Stan, take your damn
hands off me!

06:07.767 --> 06:09.734
I never liked him.

06:09.800 --> 06:11.734
The moment that worm
slithered into your life,

06:11.800 --> 06:12.867
I knew he was no good.

06:12.934 --> 06:18.333
What man has
so little respect for marriage

06:18.400 --> 06:20.233
that he can cheat on
a wonderful woman

06:20.300 --> 06:23.467
and jumps into bed
with the first available bimbo?

06:23.533 --> 06:25.500
But enough about you, Stanley.

06:29.066 --> 06:31.467
Let's talk
about Kate's problems.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.934
We had no problems.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.367
That's why this
was such a shock.

06:37.433 --> 06:38.900
-Not even in bed?
-Oh, Stanley.

06:38.967 --> 06:40.934
Hey, I'm just trying to help.

06:41.033 --> 06:43.467
Most men cheat on their wives

06:43.533 --> 06:45.300
because what they have
under the sheets at home

06:45.367 --> 06:46.567
is less than satisfying.

06:46.633 --> 06:49.266
Really, Mr. 30 seconds?

06:50.667 --> 06:52.667
Mom, Dad.

06:52.734 --> 06:54.667
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, sweetheart.

06:54.734 --> 06:56.767
We're both being very insensitive.

06:57.633 --> 06:59.433
How are you feeling, kitten?

06:59.500 --> 07:00.900
Fine, grandma.

07:00.967 --> 07:02.433
You're full of it, but that's okay.

07:02.500 --> 07:04.900
A brave front
is the first step back.

07:04.967 --> 07:07.900
Bertrand Russell said that,
or was it Nipsey Russell?

07:07.967 --> 07:09.767
They're both so witty.

07:11.500 --> 07:14.700
You're right, Grandma.
I'm not fine.

07:14.767 --> 07:16.834
He really hurt me.

07:16.900 --> 07:18.233
I feel so alone.

07:18.300 --> 07:20.166
You are not alone.

07:20.233 --> 07:22.000
You have your family.

07:22.066 --> 07:23.934
Your grandma, your mother,
and your father

07:24.000 --> 07:25.433
will see you through this.

07:25.500 --> 07:29.967
Absolutely. In fact, I'll cancel
my business appointment

07:30.033 --> 07:31.233
to be here for you.

07:31.300 --> 07:33.333
Daddy, don't do that.

07:33.400 --> 07:34.467
I'll be fine, really.

07:34.533 --> 07:37.333
I'll only be gone an hour.

07:37.400 --> 07:40.100
Less than half an hour,
if she doesn't want dinner.

07:41.200 --> 07:43.367
Keep your chin up,
princess.

07:43.433 --> 07:45.300
Your chins too, Dorothy.

07:53.033 --> 07:55.600
You know,
I'm still a little confused.

07:55.667 --> 07:57.633
Who exactly is Ricky?

08:01.033 --> 08:02.133
Lucy's husband.

08:02.200 --> 08:04.734
-Wasn't Desi Lucy's husband?
-Not on the show.

08:04.800 --> 08:06.000
Desi wasn't on the show?

08:06.066 --> 08:07.266
Desi played Ricky.

08:07.333 --> 08:09.600
-Who did Lucy play?
-Lucy.

08:09.667 --> 08:11.867
But who did she play?

08:13.033 --> 08:14.934
-Lucy.
-But who did she play?

08:15.000 --> 08:16.867
Lucy played Lucy.

08:18.400 --> 08:21.800
-Then why didn't Desi play Desi?
-He wasn't tall enough.

08:27.033 --> 08:30.734
I've never seen Kate so upset.
I'm a wreck myself.

08:30.800 --> 08:32.800
I feel like this whole thing
is happen to me.

08:32.867 --> 08:35.433
I feel I'm the one
who had my guts wrenched out

08:35.500 --> 08:37.066
and my heart stomped on.

08:37.133 --> 08:39.567
(laughing)

08:44.367 --> 08:46.500
Thank you for all your support.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.800
Oh, I'm sorry, Dorothy.

08:48.867 --> 08:50.700
It's just that Lucy
doesn't know

08:50.767 --> 08:53.367
that's really Fred
dressed up as a burglar.

08:54.233 --> 08:57.133
I'm sorry. I didn't realize
this was more important.

09:04.000 --> 09:08.967
This is the part where
my good friends shut off the TV

09:09.033 --> 09:10.333
and run after me.

09:10.400 --> 09:13.300
Shut off the TV,
or I'll hurl it through the window.

09:17.934 --> 09:19.333
Thank you.
I'm touched.

09:21.400 --> 09:22.834
How are you holding up?

09:22.900 --> 09:25.767
I've just threatened to throw a TV
through a window.

09:25.834 --> 09:27.767
That's some indication.

09:27.834 --> 09:30.166
Kate is handling things pretty well.

09:30.233 --> 09:33.300
Yeah. That's tonight.
She's still in shock.

09:33.367 --> 09:37.333
I remember when Stanley told me
he was having an affair.

09:37.400 --> 09:42.767
It was 24 hours before I cut the
crotches out of all of his slacks.

09:50.066 --> 09:51.033
You didn't?

09:51.100 --> 09:53.367
I was teaching
English lit at the time.

09:53.433 --> 09:55.233
Symbolism was my life.

09:57.200 --> 10:02.100
I remember how I felt when I thought
Charlie was cheating on me.

10:02.166 --> 10:04.133
Charlie?

10:04.200 --> 10:06.867
We'd been married for 18 years.

10:06.934 --> 10:09.767
Up until then, everything had
seemed so perfect.

10:09.834 --> 10:12.166
Then one night, it happened.

10:12.233 --> 10:17.300
He came home, had dinner,
walked upstairs, and went to sleep.

10:17.367 --> 10:20.233
I went into the bathroom
and cried my eyes out.

10:22.633 --> 10:26.000
Rose, I don't want
to encourage long stories.

10:26.066 --> 10:28.700
In this story,
you left out the...

10:28.767 --> 10:30.433
-The story.
-That's the word.

10:32.400 --> 10:35.600
Charlie went right to sleep.
We didn't...

10:36.333 --> 10:38.834
well... you know.

10:40.233 --> 10:42.266
Oh, and he promised?

10:42.333 --> 10:45.367
No. It's just that
that was the first time

10:45.433 --> 10:48.333
that had happened in 18 years
of married life.

10:54.400 --> 10:55.900
Get out of here.

10:59.066 --> 11:03.266
You mean to say that,
every night, without fail,

11:03.333 --> 11:06.600
for 18 years, you and Charlie--

11:06.667 --> 11:08.600
Yeah, of course.

11:08.667 --> 11:10.100
Right after dinner.

11:12.266 --> 11:15.967
Well, no wonder you never heard
of <i>I love Lucy.</i>

11:19.166 --> 11:22.600
As it turned out,
I was just overreacting.

11:22.667 --> 11:25.400
It was a freak one-time thing.

11:25.467 --> 11:27.900
By morning,
everything was back to normal.

11:29.700 --> 11:30.800
By morning?

11:32.400 --> 11:35.000
You mean to tell me that...
every morning?

11:39.133 --> 11:41.133
Charlie said that's why
we didn't have headaches

11:41.200 --> 11:43.667
and we both had
really shiny hair.

11:50.600 --> 11:52.667
Listen, Rose, no offense,

11:52.734 --> 11:55.867
but I find that story
hard to believe.

11:55.934 --> 11:58.066
You don't even like
to talk about sex.

11:58.133 --> 12:03.033
People who talk about it a lot
don't do it very often.

12:11.600 --> 12:12.734
Coffee, anyone?

12:12.800 --> 12:14.233
(doorbell rings)

12:14.300 --> 12:16.200
-That must be Stan.
-I'll get it.

12:17.100 --> 12:18.533
Oh, Blanche.

12:18.600 --> 12:23.734
Why do men do it and think
they can get away with it?

12:23.800 --> 12:26.333
Same reason a dog
licks himself.

12:28.467 --> 12:29.934
Because he can.

12:35.500 --> 12:36.400
Where's Stan?

12:36.467 --> 12:37.867
That wasn't Stan.

12:37.934 --> 12:39.000
Oh? Who was it?

12:39.066 --> 12:40.967
Dorothy, just stay calm.

12:41.033 --> 12:43.934
Don't do anything
you'll be sorry for.

12:48.400 --> 12:49.867
Dennis.

12:49.934 --> 12:51.266
Hello, mother Dorothy.

13:01.700 --> 13:04.467
I can't believe you're here
after what you've done.

13:04.533 --> 13:06.433
You should be leaving.

13:06.500 --> 13:07.734
Mother Dorothy--

13:07.800 --> 13:11.800
And don't call me mother Dorothy.
I hate it.

13:11.867 --> 13:15.734
I feel like I should be handing out
rice on the streets of Calcutta.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.900
-Where's Kate?
-She's not here.

13:19.967 --> 13:21.166
She was coming here.

13:21.233 --> 13:23.266
-Mm-mmm. She left.
-Where'd she go?

13:23.333 --> 13:26.333
To meet with Gloria Steinem,
Betty Friedan, and Marlo Thomas.

13:26.400 --> 13:28.633
They're going to figure out

13:28.700 --> 13:30.934
how to fry your
wandering male behind.

13:33.333 --> 13:35.500
-Dennis.
-Kate, we have to talk.

13:35.567 --> 13:38.200
She has nothing to say. Get out.

13:38.266 --> 13:40.533
Mom, you don't have to speak
for me.

13:40.600 --> 13:43.467
-Dennis, get out.
-Kate, please.

13:43.533 --> 13:46.300
I'll leave if you
really want me to,

13:46.367 --> 13:50.667
but I'm just asking for a minute
to speak to you.

13:58.433 --> 14:01.633
I wonder how
he'll talk his way out of this one.

14:01.700 --> 14:04.867
Doesn't matter. I know my daughter.
Whatever he says,

14:04.934 --> 14:06.300
she'll see right through it.

14:06.367 --> 14:09.767
Good. That bum deserves
everything he gets.

14:09.834 --> 14:13.467
I'm glad he showed up.
She'll get it over with.

14:13.533 --> 14:16.066
Will she still have time to see
Marlo Thomas?

14:16.133 --> 14:17.867
I'd sure like an autograph.

14:31.800 --> 14:33.500
I can't stand it anymore.

14:34.633 --> 14:36.834
I thought you said
everybody loved Lucy.

14:37.667 --> 14:39.367
She means Kate and Dennis.

14:39.433 --> 14:41.633
How long have they been in there?

14:41.700 --> 14:43.567
Since Lucy went to Scotland.

14:44.567 --> 14:46.700
That's over 30 years, Rose.

14:46.767 --> 14:51.367
It's been about an hour.
Kate had a lot to get off her chest.

14:56.233 --> 14:59.533
He didn't have the courtesy
to say goodbye.

14:59.600 --> 15:02.433
-He's coming back, mom.
-What?

15:02.500 --> 15:05.100
He's getting his suitcase
out of the car.

15:05.166 --> 15:07.133
We talked things over.
Everything's okay.

15:07.200 --> 15:09.333
Okay? Everything's okay?

15:09.400 --> 15:11.433
-Come on, Rose.
-Well, what about Lucy?

15:11.500 --> 15:13.467
We'll watch Lucy
on the portable TV.

15:13.533 --> 15:15.900
But that set's black and white.

15:19.166 --> 15:21.033
Dennis explained everything.

15:21.100 --> 15:23.667
Explained what?
How he did it?

15:23.734 --> 15:25.967
I explained that to you
when you were 12.

15:26.600 --> 15:29.100
I can live with his apology.

15:29.166 --> 15:32.367
He promised
he'll never do it again.

15:32.433 --> 15:34.567
I don't want this
to end my marriage.

15:34.633 --> 15:36.633
You're making a big mistake.

15:37.133 --> 15:39.433
Dennis is my husband.

15:39.500 --> 15:41.734
If I can forgive him,
you should too.

15:41.800 --> 15:43.133
Forgive him?

15:43.200 --> 15:46.200
Look, it's my marriage.

15:46.266 --> 15:48.033
I never should
have come here.

15:48.100 --> 15:49.800
That was a big mistake.

15:49.867 --> 15:51.934
We'll be out of here
in the morning.

16:11.233 --> 16:14.066
Ma.

16:14.133 --> 16:15.367
What's going on?

16:15.433 --> 16:17.834
Honey, I'm sorry,
but I have to talk to you.

16:17.900 --> 16:19.300
Dennis is here.

16:19.367 --> 16:21.734
He told Kate that he was sorry
for what he did

16:21.800 --> 16:22.900
and they've made up.

16:22.967 --> 16:25.734
Marvelous, now,
get the hell out of my room.

16:25.800 --> 16:28.800
Ma, Dennis had an affair.
What he did was terrible.

16:28.867 --> 16:30.100
How can she forgive him?

16:30.166 --> 16:32.500
Dorothy, please,
let me go back to sleep.

16:32.567 --> 16:34.200
I was in the middle of a dream

16:34.266 --> 16:37.533
where I was captive on a desert
island by Cesar Romero

16:37.600 --> 16:38.867
in a loincloth.

16:39.967 --> 16:41.900
Ma, Kate and I had a fight.

16:41.967 --> 16:43.900
I have to talk to you.

16:43.967 --> 16:46.266
Dorothy, you know that blue
washcloth in my bathroom?

16:46.333 --> 16:47.266
Yeah.

16:47.333 --> 16:50.400
That's how big Cesar's loincloth was,
good night.

16:52.033 --> 16:54.433
Ma.

16:55.266 --> 16:58.800
All right. What did you and Kate
have a fight about?

16:58.867 --> 17:01.166
About advertising condoms
on television.

17:01.233 --> 17:03.300
About Dennis.

17:03.367 --> 17:05.400
I mean, I can't believe
that she would go back to him.

17:05.467 --> 17:07.633
I told her that
it was a big mistake.

17:08.133 --> 17:10.867
Who's asking you what you think?
It's none of your business.

17:10.934 --> 17:12.467
Kate came to me.

17:12.533 --> 17:15.367
She came to you to listen,
not tell her how to run her life.

17:15.433 --> 17:16.767
You should have
stayed out of it.

17:17.266 --> 17:19.133
I don't know what to do.

17:19.200 --> 17:21.200
All right.

17:21.266 --> 17:23.633
Sit. Listen.

17:23.700 --> 17:25.066
Learn.

17:25.133 --> 17:29.100
Picture this,
Brooklyn, July, 1949.

17:29.166 --> 17:30.934
Ma, can't you put
a sentence together?

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
You sound like a sportscaster.

17:33.066 --> 17:34.600
Ah, shut up.

17:35.100 --> 17:37.834
Anyway, it was the night
of your first anniversary.

17:37.900 --> 17:40.100
You showed up at my house
at 2 in the morning

17:40.166 --> 17:43.200
crying and carrying on.
You looked like hell.

17:46.166 --> 17:50.066
You told me you had cooked
an anniversary dinner for Stan.

17:50.133 --> 17:52.400
He came home late.
He didn't have a gift.

17:52.467 --> 17:54.367
And there was lipstick
on his shirt.

17:54.433 --> 17:57.900
You kept saying to me,
"ma, what should I do?"

17:57.967 --> 18:00.200
-You remember what I told you?
-Yeah.

18:00.266 --> 18:02.233
Thank god, what was it?
I forgot.

18:03.367 --> 18:06.934
You said, if you could erase
this one day,

18:07.000 --> 18:10.300
is this still the man you want
to spend the rest of your life with.

18:10.367 --> 18:11.667
And you said yes.

18:11.734 --> 18:13.967
And I thought to myself,
"idiot."

18:14.033 --> 18:15.600
But I kept my mouth shut.

18:17.033 --> 18:19.400
I knew this was a decision
you had to make.

18:19.467 --> 18:22.567
But your saying that I should
stay out of this mess

18:22.633 --> 18:24.233
between Kate and Dennis.

18:24.300 --> 18:26.433
I said it. I used it is a story.

18:26.500 --> 18:29.767
What do you want me to do,
embroider it on your underwear?

18:29.834 --> 18:31.033
Just stay out of it.

18:31.100 --> 18:33.066
I don't know if I can do that.

18:34.500 --> 18:36.200
Then your gonna lose Kate.

18:36.266 --> 18:39.767
And someday, someday
Stan will be the one to call you up

18:39.834 --> 18:42.333
and tell you, you have a grandchild
who you're never gonna see.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
Good night, Ma.

18:58.800 --> 19:01.300
Not tonight, Cesar,
I'm not in the mood anymore.

19:09.200 --> 19:11.767
That last episode of
<i>I love Lucy</i> was hilarious!

19:11.834 --> 19:13.133
Oh, sure was.

19:13.200 --> 19:16.433
I never realized you could have
that much fun staying up all night.

19:16.500 --> 19:19.166
Oh? Not even with Charlie?

19:19.233 --> 19:21.567
We never stayed up all night.

19:21.633 --> 19:25.467
Just 7 to midnight every night,
5 to 7 every morning,

19:25.533 --> 19:27.834
and, of course,
till noon on Sundays.

19:33.633 --> 19:36.667
Good lord! No wonder
you still mourn that man.

19:39.133 --> 19:39.934
Morning.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
-How you doing?
-Better.

19:42.066 --> 19:45.867
Ma and I talked.
I know how to handle things.

19:45.934 --> 19:48.367
For once, you'll keep quiet.

19:48.433 --> 19:53.033
For things to be ok, I want
to get everything off my chest.

19:53.100 --> 19:56.700
Fine. You'll feel better,
but you'll lose your daughter.

19:57.200 --> 19:58.467
Morning, everyone.

19:58.533 --> 20:01.166
-How did you get in?
-Key under the mat.

20:01.233 --> 20:03.166
-Do I smell waffles?
-No.

20:03.233 --> 20:04.767
Could I smell waffles?

20:06.100 --> 20:08.967
Does this look like
the house of pancakes?

20:09.033 --> 20:11.033
So how's Kate doing?

20:11.100 --> 20:12.700
Better than I am.

20:12.767 --> 20:15.200
Dennis is here,
and she's forgiven him.

20:15.266 --> 20:18.633
Dennis here?
Hold my hair. I'm going to kill him!

20:18.700 --> 20:21.233
Sit down and shut up.

20:21.300 --> 20:22.800
-Morning, everybody.
-Hi, Daddy.

20:22.867 --> 20:26.467
I hear that you and Dennis
are back together.

20:26.533 --> 20:29.300
That's right. We're leaving
for the airport now.

20:29.367 --> 20:31.567
Kate,
I want to say something.

20:31.633 --> 20:34.000
-Yeah.
-Not to you. To Dennis.

20:35.300 --> 20:38.300
Dennis,
I want to speak with you.

20:38.367 --> 20:39.233
Mother.

20:39.300 --> 20:41.000
It's all right, Kate.

20:41.066 --> 20:42.266
Is your name Dennis?

20:42.333 --> 20:44.567
I have a right to be there.

20:44.633 --> 20:46.500
One sperm with
a sense of direction,

20:46.567 --> 20:49.233
and I'm paying for it for life.

20:55.266 --> 20:56.033
Dorothy, I really--

20:56.100 --> 20:58.633
Please, Dennis,
I just want you to listen.

21:03.200 --> 21:05.934
Yesterday Kate
came to me crying.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.667
She was more hurt than
I'd ever seen her.

21:08.734 --> 21:10.433
-Dorothy--
-Please, please,

21:10.500 --> 21:14.100
I want you to understand
what that does to a parent.

21:15.734 --> 21:19.900
Seeing your child hurt
is worse than any pain

21:19.967 --> 21:21.967
you can possibly feel yourself.

21:22.934 --> 21:24.100
When they're little, you...

21:24.934 --> 21:28.433
you protect them from the bullies
on the playground.

21:28.500 --> 21:32.934
Then later, you suffer with them
through acne and puppy love.

21:34.333 --> 21:38.033
And the first date,
the first time alone in the car.

21:38.100 --> 21:42.200
Finally, they meet someone
who'll love and care for them.

21:42.266 --> 21:43.867
They don't need you anymore.

21:43.934 --> 21:46.467
You're not too thrilled,
but you get used to it.

21:48.100 --> 21:51.500
Then... then something happens,
and you find out

21:51.567 --> 21:54.000
there's still bullies
on the playground.

21:54.066 --> 21:56.567
All the old instincts come back.

21:56.633 --> 21:58.000
That's what happened
yesterday.

21:58.066 --> 22:00.233
You and Kate have made up,

22:00.300 --> 22:04.333
but I still have the same feelings.
Do you understand?

22:04.400 --> 22:08.133
Yes. I did something stupid
that can't be undone,

22:08.200 --> 22:11.400
but I'm doing everything possible
to make it up to Kate. I love her.

22:12.133 --> 22:15.900
Nothing like this
will ever happen again.

22:15.967 --> 22:17.967
Good.

22:19.166 --> 22:23.667
Because if it does, I will
break every bone in your hands.

22:25.100 --> 22:28.800
You'll spend the rest of your life
selling newspapers out of a wagon.

22:32.300 --> 22:34.233
Keep it zipped, buddy.
She's not kidding.

22:37.600 --> 22:40.033
-Dennis, is everything okay?
-Everything is fine.

22:40.100 --> 22:42.667
You better hurry.
You'll miss your plane.

22:42.734 --> 22:44.066
Thanks, mom.

22:46.800 --> 22:48.000
Thanks, Dad.

22:48.066 --> 22:50.700
If you're not doing anything
around memorial day,

22:50.767 --> 22:52.200
maybe you'll visit.

22:52.266 --> 22:53.266
And me?

22:53.333 --> 22:56.166
Of course, Dennis. Of course.

22:56.233 --> 22:58.000
You're always included.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.467
Dorothy, you're hurting me.

23:07.166 --> 23:09.166
-Good-bye again.
-Good-bye, darling.

23:11.333 --> 23:14.633
I'm so glad
things worked out.

23:14.700 --> 23:15.700
Me too.

23:15.767 --> 23:17.133
Maybe you're not
a grandmama yet,

23:17.200 --> 23:19.133
but you're a darned good mama.

23:19.200 --> 23:23.233
Kate's going to be a darned good
mama too, sometime.

23:23.300 --> 23:24.667
How do you know?

23:24.734 --> 23:26.133
It runs in the family.

23:28.066 --> 23:30.133
I'll be going too.

23:31.000 --> 23:32.533
You know, Dorothy,

23:32.600 --> 23:36.567
out on the lanai out there,
it was like old times.

23:36.633 --> 23:39.000
You and me, a team. United.

23:39.066 --> 23:42.467
Partners.
It felt pretty good, didn't it?

23:42.967 --> 23:44.367
It sure did.

23:48.467 --> 23:50.133
Where did it
go wrong, Dorothy?

23:50.200 --> 23:53.367
Oh, who knows?

23:53.433 --> 23:55.300
These things happen.

23:55.367 --> 23:56.500
Oh, I remember.

23:56.567 --> 23:58.500
I wasn't happy at home
under the sheets.

24:01.700 --> 24:03.967
Dorothy, you're hurting me.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.633
I mean it.
You're really hurting me!

24:14.500 --> 24:17.967
(theme music playing)
