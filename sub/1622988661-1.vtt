01:24.547 --> 01:29.253
- Dominoes, the greatest game
ever invented mother fuckers.

01:29.288 --> 01:31.156
Good evening, ladies
and gentlemen,

01:31.191 --> 01:34.225
Wannabe domino players,
fans, groupies,

01:34.260 --> 01:35.886
and niggas sick
and tired of losing

01:35.921 --> 01:37.855
all the motherfucking time.

01:37.890 --> 01:41.331
Welcome to my Masterclass.

01:41.366 --> 01:46.204
I am the Pimpfesser
Dr. DMF, AKA Big Dub.

01:46.239 --> 01:49.174
Look, I'm here to
explain this shit,

01:49.209 --> 01:51.539
so sit down and
shut the fuck up.

01:52.806 --> 01:54.773
See dominoes was
started by the Chinese.

01:56.909 --> 01:58.678
Down in the Compton
part of China.

02:06.490 --> 02:07.786
Back in the war.
-  What war?

02:07.821 --> 02:09.458
- Would you shut the fuck up?

02:09.493 --> 02:11.394
I told you I'm on TV.

02:11.429 --> 02:13.462
It don't matter what war.

02:13.497 --> 02:15.431
Nigga we got so many, who cares?

02:15.466 --> 02:17.367
- Yeah, shut the fuck up.

02:17.402 --> 02:19.237
- Like I was saying before
I was rudely interrupted.

02:20.636 --> 02:22.735
My great- great- great-
great- grandfather

02:22.770 --> 02:25.441
learned the game
from the Chinese.

02:25.476 --> 02:26.805
He snatched the big six.

02:26.840 --> 02:28.675
We wrote the whole damn game.

02:31.383 --> 02:33.482
Then he smuggled
it back to America.

02:33.517 --> 02:36.320
Where it spread like
mudbutt on ribs.

02:36.355 --> 02:37.948
You dig?

02:37.983 --> 02:40.258
Mother fuckers from all parts
of the world took to it.

02:40.293 --> 02:42.359
'Cause see, that's
the magic of dominoes.

02:42.394 --> 02:44.295
It brings people together.

02:44.330 --> 02:47.232
Even the saltiest motherfucker
will pull that stick

02:47.267 --> 02:49.762
out of their ass when they
sit down and throw them bones.

02:49.797 --> 02:51.863
28 bones to be exact.

02:51.898 --> 02:55.966
Yeah, yeah I know, real bones
are white and so are dominoes,

02:56.001 --> 02:57.935
but they wouldn't mean shit

02:57.970 --> 03:00.509
if it wasn't for them
black dots, you feel me?

03:01.545 --> 03:02.643
Can I get a witness?

03:02.678 --> 03:03.743
Black power, alright.

03:03.778 --> 03:05.580
- Ah fuck you.

03:05.615 --> 03:07.780
Big six is the highest number.

03:07.815 --> 03:09.287
Match the numbers in
your hand to seven

03:09.322 --> 03:10.981
with the bones on the table.

03:11.016 --> 03:12.884
If you can't play,

03:12.919 --> 03:14.622
that's when you draw from
the boneyard until you can.

03:14.657 --> 03:16.261
Score in multiples of five,

03:16.296 --> 03:18.362
and play until you
have your last domino.

03:18.397 --> 03:21.728
And when that's gone,
you yell "Domino!"

03:21.763 --> 03:25.336
Or as we say in the hood,
"Domino motherfucker!"

03:25.371 --> 03:27.437
To let them know you run shit.

03:27.472 --> 03:29.769
And that's all there is to it.

03:29.804 --> 03:31.474
Buy my app, if you're too slow

03:31.509 --> 03:33.245
to figure the rest
of this shit out.

03:33.280 --> 03:36.006

ratchetest domino tournament

03:40.584 --> 03:41.715

I'm gonna take them.

13:12.485 --> 13:13.352
Yeah.

13:29.601 --> 13:31.909
- This is my kitchen.

13:31.944 --> 13:33.405
Where I cook things I like.

13:35.013 --> 13:36.375
I don't know what
white folks like.

13:36.410 --> 13:37.508
That's the living room.

13:40.183 --> 13:42.315
That's where I play dominoes.

13:42.350 --> 13:44.152
Hey, hey, don't touch that!

13:44.187 --> 13:45.857
Still got a game going.

13:45.892 --> 13:47.892
- I'm sorry, I didn't know.

13:51.227 --> 13:52.127
Who's she?

13:55.363 --> 13:56.263
- That's Ella May.

13:57.629 --> 14:00.366
Sweetest most faithful
woman to ever live.

14:03.140 --> 14:05.338
- Ella, I wanna
give you something.

14:05.373 --> 14:06.845
I wanna give you this ring.

14:08.211 --> 14:10.112
- Gerald, Where'd you
get this ring from?

14:10.147 --> 14:13.115
I know you didn't buy me no
ring with no gambling money.

14:13.150 --> 14:14.919
I don't want no gambling ring.

14:14.954 --> 14:16.888
- I told you I ain't
gambling no more.

14:16.923 --> 14:19.286
I got this ring with
my hard earned money,

14:19.321 --> 14:20.551
and I want you to have it.

14:21.455 --> 14:22.322
I ain't lying.

14:23.688 --> 14:26.458
- Then I'll wear it,
and cherish it forever!

14:28.297 --> 14:29.934
- Shit, you better cherish
that damn ring forever.

14:29.969 --> 14:31.496
You with me for the long haul.

14:31.531 --> 14:33.432
Till death, do us part.

14:33.467 --> 14:34.565
- Okay.

14:35.601 --> 14:36.908
- Goddam mosquito.

14:36.943 --> 14:38.536
Where the waiter at? Goddamn.

14:38.571 --> 14:40.175
Been waiting for our
damn food for 30 minutes.

14:40.210 --> 14:42.243
All they brought us
is some damn wine.

14:42.278 --> 14:43.145
I'm hungry!

14:47.217 --> 14:48.579
That's your room on the left.

14:50.957 --> 14:51.923
Wait a minute.

14:51.958 --> 14:53.353
Slow your roll son.

14:53.388 --> 14:55.256
Everything in here
is important to me.

14:55.291 --> 14:56.994
I don't want you to forget that.

14:57.029 --> 14:59.095
- Neat, I definitely
will, Granddad.

14:59.130 --> 15:00.558
- And I'm not your granddad!

15:00.593 --> 15:02.395
Do we look related?

15:02.430 --> 15:04.199
My good for nothing,
all the time, son

15:04.234 --> 15:05.937
ditched you on me.

15:05.972 --> 15:08.302
And that's what this
is, social service.

15:08.337 --> 15:10.502
So since we gotta be
trapped in here together,

15:10.537 --> 15:12.240
I got some rules and shit.

15:13.606 --> 15:15.705
Don't touch nothing
that ain't yours.

15:15.740 --> 15:18.675
Wash your ass, keep
my house clean,

15:18.710 --> 15:19.743
and make yourself useful.

15:21.713 --> 15:24.549
White privilege is a foreign
term in Compton, boy.

15:24.584 --> 15:26.650
If you didn't
know, now you know.

15:27.719 --> 15:29.422
And that's my room on the right.

15:31.096 --> 15:33.063
- Whoa, that's a lot of pills.

15:33.098 --> 15:34.999
- Hey, don't touch those.

15:36.035 --> 15:37.298
They're for my heart.

15:37.333 --> 15:38.970
I forget them sometimes.

15:39.005 --> 15:41.071
So you see them lying
around, leave them be.

15:42.734 --> 15:45.570
- And you must be Ms. Jeffries.

15:45.605 --> 15:47.341
- Mr. McDonough.

15:47.376 --> 15:50.179
- Yes, Walter McDonough,
so nice to meet you.

15:50.214 --> 15:51.609
- Pleasure to meet you.

15:51.644 --> 15:54.249
Please, let me show
you around the venue.

15:54.284 --> 15:57.087
Now, Pastor recently
bought this place.

15:57.122 --> 16:00.288
So it's still a
work in progress.

16:00.323 --> 16:02.257
Oh, don't mind the mess.

16:04.063 --> 16:06.063
- As long as you don't
mind my camera crew here!

16:06.098 --> 16:07.427
You're so gorgeous!

16:07.462 --> 16:08.659
You should be in the movies!

16:08.694 --> 16:10.529
- Oh, I wish I was.

16:10.564 --> 16:13.103
- I mean, this crib could
use some renovations.

16:14.436 --> 16:16.271
I mean, wasn't
Jesus a carpenter?

16:16.306 --> 16:19.010
- Yes, and a divine one.

16:19.045 --> 16:21.045
- Oh, all right.

16:21.080 --> 16:22.178
Well, hopefully
he'll come back soon.

16:22.213 --> 16:23.740
We could really use him, huh?

16:23.775 --> 16:26.017
You know, I'm just,
I'm like a chameleon.

16:26.052 --> 16:28.580
I'm always rebuilding
myself, rebranding.

16:28.615 --> 16:31.583
After 34 years of
award-winning service,

16:31.618 --> 16:35.290
they just revoked my
retirement fund, huh?

16:35.325 --> 16:38.590
I guess you don't send a
little old mimis around

16:38.625 --> 16:40.658
with the lady showing her-

16:40.693 --> 16:42.330
But, uh, you know,

16:42.365 --> 16:44.233
so I had to dabble in a
lot of different things.

16:44.268 --> 16:48.303
And some of them were just
right before their time.

16:52.441 --> 16:54.705
You know, they say
you miss a 100%

16:54.740 --> 16:56.278
of the shots you don't take.

16:56.313 --> 16:59.215
So I'm glad I took those swings.

16:59.250 --> 17:01.811
It's just unfortunate that
they ricocheted right back

17:01.846 --> 17:03.615
and hit me in the nuts.

17:03.650 --> 17:07.553
- Oh, this way to
the pastor's office.

17:07.588 --> 17:09.522
He should be in there now.

17:09.557 --> 17:10.655
- Give you a hand there.

17:10.690 --> 17:12.228
- Thank you, Mr. McDonough.

17:12.263 --> 17:13.097
- There you go.

17:13.132 --> 17:14.263
- Follow me.

17:17.862 --> 17:19.169
- Goddamn, Ms. Jeffries.

17:19.204 --> 17:20.830
Even the Devil knocked twice.

17:20.865 --> 17:22.733
I was just spreading some--

17:22.768 --> 17:25.604
God comes
in a thief in the night.

17:25.639 --> 17:27.276
Yeah, He do.

17:27.311 --> 17:28.706
Okay, we brought a
guest, a visitor.

17:28.741 --> 17:32.314
- Pastor Steele, this
is Mr. Walter McDonough.

17:32.349 --> 17:35.680
He's the gentleman who's
going to rent the venue

17:35.715 --> 17:37.253
tomorrow afternoon.

17:37.288 --> 17:38.617
His crew is loading
in right now.

17:38.652 --> 17:40.751
- Okay, you got my check, right?

17:40.786 --> 17:41.620
- Yeah, yeah, I sure do.

17:41.655 --> 17:42.786
It's right here.

17:42.821 --> 17:44.095
Yeah, there you go.

17:44.130 --> 17:46.295
- All right, all right.

17:46.330 --> 17:47.626
Thank you, Jesus.

17:47.661 --> 17:49.232
All right, Ms. Jeffries,

17:49.267 --> 17:50.662
You go and run that
money down to the bank.

17:50.697 --> 17:52.499
You know, take care of,

17:52.534 --> 17:55.139
and I'll put you on
later, all right?

17:55.174 --> 17:57.570
Be marching with you, okay?

18:00.575 --> 18:02.377
Shit, for an old lady,

18:02.412 --> 18:04.346
Ms. Jeffries got ass.

18:06.251 --> 18:09.450
But anyway, you know, this
was a Mexican restaurant.

18:09.485 --> 18:11.386
And they was selling
some nasty tacos.

18:11.421 --> 18:13.256
That's why it shut
down, but you know,

18:13.291 --> 18:15.819
and then I decided to
get ordained by the Lord

18:15.854 --> 18:18.195
and we went into
business together.

18:18.230 --> 18:19.493
So we got a lot to do, man.

18:19.528 --> 18:21.132
A lot to catch up on.

18:21.167 --> 18:22.760
So I'm going to
take y'all around

18:22.795 --> 18:24.234
in the spirit of the Lord.

18:35.412 --> 18:36.510
- Granp...

18:36.545 --> 18:37.445
Mr. Edges, your food is ready.

18:38.943 --> 18:40.547
- Hot damn Rufus,
it's been your play

18:40.582 --> 18:42.648
for the last five
fucking minutes.

18:42.683 --> 18:43.616
- Mr.--

18:43.651 --> 18:45.288
- Not now, boy!

18:45.323 --> 18:46.388
Can't you see I'm busy?

18:49.228 --> 18:50.755
What, boy? You're
breaking my concentration.

18:50.790 --> 18:52.658
- Well, your food's ready.

18:52.693 --> 18:55.397
My mom says the body needs
three square meals a day

18:55.432 --> 18:56.596
to be happy and healthy.

18:58.402 --> 18:59.896
- You sure she stopped at three?

19:00.965 --> 19:03.306
What I need is to play somebody

19:03.341 --> 19:04.835
who ain't just sold their fridge

19:04.870 --> 19:06.639
to get that China Brown.

19:06.674 --> 19:09.477
What I need is somebody
I can talk shit to.

19:09.512 --> 19:10.907
- You can talk shit to me.

19:10.942 --> 19:12.414
- Watch your fucking
mouth in my house.

19:15.716 --> 19:17.518
What you know about them bones?

19:17.553 --> 19:19.652
- It's basic
probability, really.

19:19.687 --> 19:21.588
It all comes down to
how many variations

19:21.623 --> 19:23.227
of numbers you can play

19:23.262 --> 19:24.855
based on the factors of
the hand you've drawn.

19:24.890 --> 19:27.297
And then you calculate the
most efficient statistical one,

19:27.332 --> 19:29.200
until you're down
to a single tile.

19:32.469 --> 19:33.765
- You mean you know
how to play this shit?

19:33.800 --> 19:37.505
- Well, I, uh, yeah.

19:38.376 --> 19:39.639
- Hell, Andy!

19:39.674 --> 19:40.937
Shit!

19:40.972 --> 19:41.905
Hell!

19:41.940 --> 19:42.774
Damn!

19:42.809 --> 19:43.907
Shit!

19:43.942 --> 19:45.942
Why didn't you say so?

19:45.977 --> 19:47.284
Rufus.

19:47.319 --> 19:48.450
Rufus!

19:48.485 --> 19:50.980
Take your ass home!

19:51.015 --> 19:52.916
No, no way down
to the damn floor.

19:52.951 --> 19:55.292
Go on home, you
ain't no good here!

19:57.494 --> 19:59.857
I'm gonna call your mama
and tell you on your way.

20:00.926 --> 20:01.892
- You know I ain't got no car.

20:01.927 --> 20:03.564
You calling me an Uber?

20:03.599 --> 20:04.565
- Uber?

20:04.600 --> 20:05.731
The fuck is a Uber?

20:05.766 --> 20:06.897
I got some Goobers.

20:06.932 --> 20:08.437
You want some peanuts?

20:08.472 --> 20:09.504
- Bye, Rufus.

20:12.344 --> 20:13.607
- Let's see what you got.

20:18.284 --> 20:19.217
Watch them.

20:25.049 --> 20:26.257
That's all you got?

20:28.723 --> 20:30.327
That a bitch!

20:30.362 --> 20:32.329
Your mama do voodoo or
something like that?

20:33.464 --> 20:34.096
Damn!

20:37.303 --> 20:39.402
Is white privilege in Compton?

20:40.636 --> 20:41.965
- Domino?

20:43.001 --> 20:44.902
- The fuck just happen?

20:44.937 --> 20:46.871
What kind of Twilight Zone
have I just slipped into?

20:50.448 --> 20:52.008
Is this what a
stroke feels like?

20:54.617 --> 20:57.783
- Sorry, well, my mom
says I don't make friends

20:57.818 --> 21:00.291
because they're intimidated
by my intellect.

21:00.326 --> 21:02.425
And that I should be
proud of my gifts.

21:03.527 --> 21:05.362
I try to listen to her.

21:05.397 --> 21:07.463
But it's hard to see your inner
light, or much light at all,

21:07.498 --> 21:09.630
when you're stuffed
inside your locker.

21:09.665 --> 21:10.532
- Yeah.

21:12.338 --> 21:13.568
Well how the fuck did your
little albino sausage fingers

21:13.603 --> 21:15.801
learn to throw bones like that?

21:15.836 --> 21:17.671
- Oh, from this app.

21:17.706 --> 21:18.672
- App?

21:18.707 --> 21:20.509
The fuck is a app?

21:20.544 --> 21:21.873
- It's a way you can
play people on the phone.

21:21.908 --> 21:23.644
It was actually
beating the AI system

21:23.679 --> 21:25.514
that got me so proficient
at it and the--

21:25.549 --> 21:27.351
- Fuck, wait a goddamn minute!

21:27.386 --> 21:28.517
You're telling me you ain't
playing against people

21:28.552 --> 21:30.321
just your damn phone?

21:30.356 --> 21:32.521
- Well, there are other
opponents on their phones, too.

21:32.556 --> 21:34.391
- The fuck is the
world coming to!

21:34.426 --> 21:37.053
Dear God, Jesus, you oughta
just come back and kill us all.

21:37.088 --> 21:38.791
Oh, bring the rapture, Lord.

21:38.826 --> 21:39.693
Look.

21:41.092 --> 21:44.632
You can't play bones
with a screen, boy.

21:44.667 --> 21:49.373
Dominoes, real dominoes is
all about the mental game

21:49.408 --> 21:52.101
just as much as
it is the numbers.

21:52.136 --> 21:53.806
You hear me?

21:53.841 --> 21:54.840
We got a lot of training to do--

21:54.875 --> 21:55.742
- We?

21:57.141 --> 21:58.613
I'm sorry, I just, I
can't cheat for you.

21:58.648 --> 22:00.109
My mom would--

22:00.144 --> 22:01.946
- It ain't cheating actually.

22:01.981 --> 22:05.048
Niggas do bones with a spotter.

22:05.083 --> 22:07.688
You do wanna be a
real nigga, don't you?

22:08.955 --> 22:10.691
Ah, don't you answer that shit.

22:10.726 --> 22:13.056
I see that shit eating
grin on your face.

22:13.091 --> 22:15.124
Look, I need a spotter.

22:15.159 --> 22:17.599
You wanna be a real nigga.

22:17.634 --> 22:19.062
Everybody wins.

22:19.097 --> 22:19.964
So come on.

22:20.934 --> 22:22.934
Let's practice.

22:26.907 --> 22:28.379
What's you got in your hand?

22:28.414 --> 22:29.512
- Double six.

22:29.547 --> 22:30.513
- No, no, elephant ass, no.

22:30.548 --> 22:32.009
It's called Big Six!

22:33.749 --> 22:35.584
Look, I don't want you
getting laughed off the table

22:35.619 --> 22:37.916
with your Oxford English
motherfucking speaking ass.

22:37.951 --> 22:39.588
All right?

22:39.623 --> 22:41.458
Lord, help me, he
got a ways to go.

22:41.493 --> 22:43.625
- You know, you sure talk a lot

22:43.660 --> 22:47.662
but I'm beating you 75 to 25.

22:47.697 --> 22:48.564
- Are you?

22:49.633 --> 22:51.600
You think you're winning, huh?

22:53.769 --> 22:56.440
What I see across from me

22:56.475 --> 22:58.508
is a neglected little boy.

22:59.577 --> 23:01.170
You know my son is

23:03.141 --> 23:05.141
pumping your momma right now.

23:05.176 --> 23:09.420
Putting an integrated
baby in her with my DNA.

23:09.455 --> 23:11.785
That's going to be
stronger, faster,

23:11.820 --> 23:15.822
and a million times more
mocha latte lovelier than you.

23:15.857 --> 23:17.956
And when that baby comes,

23:17.991 --> 23:19.826
it ain't gonna take no time

23:19.861 --> 23:23.929
forgetting your pasty, two
tons of fun ass ever existed.

23:26.769 --> 23:27.636
Domino.

23:28.639 --> 23:30.474
See.

23:30.509 --> 23:33.708
You don't win at bones unless
you get in the folks head.

23:34.744 --> 23:36.876
The game is all mental.

23:38.715 --> 23:40.110
- I'm tired of this game.

23:40.145 --> 23:42.552
Why don't you me about
that scary devil guy

23:42.587 --> 23:43.982
you were talking about?

23:44.017 --> 23:46.050
- Never mentioned that
guy's name in my house.

23:46.085 --> 23:47.689
And if there is a God,

23:47.724 --> 23:49.152
he'll give me my revenge

23:49.187 --> 23:51.220
at this tournament
I'm training for.

23:51.255 --> 23:54.124
I want the whole
world to see me whoop

23:54.159 --> 23:56.599
that tweaking bully's ass!

24:06.204 --> 24:08.039
- See, usually ladies,

24:08.074 --> 24:11.482
I don't mingle amongst
them gangster thug

24:12.584 --> 24:14.210
sober motherfuckers.

24:14.245 --> 24:15.948
Who in the fuck gonna
gang bang if you're sober?

24:15.983 --> 24:18.654
That's silly, I
don't trust them.

24:18.689 --> 24:21.888
See, if I want to win this
tournament and get my crown,

24:21.923 --> 24:25.529
I had to call in the
baddest gangster bitches

24:25.564 --> 24:27.157
security guards I know.

24:27.192 --> 24:29.192
And it was you and you.

24:29.227 --> 24:32.162
You gotta understand
this is about me.

24:32.197 --> 24:34.769
I am the greatest
motherfucker that ever lived.

24:34.804 --> 24:36.067
There's God.

24:36.102 --> 24:36.969
And then,

24:38.137 --> 24:39.807
there is me!

24:54.087 --> 24:56.186
- You know the Lord
laid his hand down

24:56.221 --> 24:57.693
in this one right here.

24:57.728 --> 24:59.629
You know, this is the room.

24:59.664 --> 25:02.027
You know, this is the one
for all my entrepreneurs.

25:02.062 --> 25:04.227
You know, the big wigs.

25:06.099 --> 25:07.967
- Yeah man, what a blessing.
- So, but this is the lobby?

25:08.002 --> 25:09.870
- Oh yeah, yeah, what a
blessing, what a blessing.

25:09.905 --> 25:12.169
- Well it just seemed like the
pictures made it look bigger

25:12.204 --> 25:13.170
in the pamphlet.

25:13.205 --> 25:15.040
- Yeah, we do that.

25:15.075 --> 25:17.581
- Namita, hold off one second.

25:17.616 --> 25:19.682
Is this ceiling load-bearing?

25:20.685 --> 25:21.882
- Uh, partially.

25:21.917 --> 25:23.587
Hey, God bless you.

25:23.622 --> 25:25.886
- Well, let's just
hold off for a second.

25:25.921 --> 25:27.756
Till I get this figured out.

25:27.791 --> 25:31.122
I got a lot of run
running on this

25:31.157 --> 25:34.862
and I can't have any lawsuits

25:34.897 --> 25:38.701
'cause I've technically
maxed out my credit cards

25:38.736 --> 25:41.132
and put a lien on my house.

25:41.167 --> 25:42.936
But it's all good.

25:42.971 --> 25:44.234
It's all good.

25:44.269 --> 25:45.774
Whoa!

25:45.809 --> 25:47.776
Oh, I gotta sit down.

25:47.811 --> 25:48.843
Woo, who knew?

25:50.341 --> 25:51.912
But yeah, it's good.

25:51.947 --> 25:53.210
You know, I haven't
seen my kids in a while.

25:53.245 --> 25:55.784
Ever since my wife threw me out.

25:55.819 --> 25:57.621
She said, and I quote,

25:59.251 --> 26:03.286
"I'm an abject failure and
a complete joke of man."

26:04.355 --> 26:05.860
But I think this tournament's

26:05.895 --> 26:06.960
gonna turn everything
around, right?

26:07.864 --> 26:08.830
Yeah!

26:08.865 --> 26:10.029
We can do this, right?

26:10.064 --> 26:11.998
Namita, give me, give it up.

26:12.033 --> 26:13.868
All right, yeah.

26:13.903 --> 26:15.771
- My name is Namita Sodhi.

26:15.806 --> 26:18.202
I am the event coordinator
and general task master

26:18.237 --> 26:19.643
for the WDC.

26:20.712 --> 26:22.371
I'd like to say, for the record,

26:22.406 --> 26:24.307
that I'm here to serve my
client's personal needs

26:24.342 --> 26:25.946
and tastes.

26:25.981 --> 26:27.079
And that if I were
running things,

26:27.114 --> 26:29.818
my decisions would have been,

26:29.853 --> 26:31.721
different.

26:31.756 --> 26:33.349
But considering the I'm
the only, even marginally,

26:33.384 --> 26:35.252
competent person here,

26:35.287 --> 26:37.122
I think things could have
turned out a lot worse.

26:37.157 --> 26:41.126
And by that, I mean we've
yet to have anyone seriously,

26:41.161 --> 26:42.127
injured.

26:43.163 --> 26:44.129
Oh, shit.

26:44.164 --> 26:45.130
This is fucking heavy.

26:45.165 --> 26:46.362
Oh shit, shit, shit!

26:48.201 --> 26:51.268
- And this is my
prize back here.

26:51.303 --> 26:54.645
'Cause the Lord said,
"Let there be light!"

26:58.013 --> 26:58.847
There it is.

26:58.882 --> 27:00.145
- Oh, yeah.

27:00.180 --> 27:02.246
Does that happen a lot?

27:02.281 --> 27:04.985
- Oh, when you got
Jesus on the main line,

27:05.020 --> 27:07.020
anything is possible.

27:07.055 --> 27:08.153
- Okay.

27:08.188 --> 27:10.925
- And I call this my incubator.

27:12.764 --> 27:16.095
These are the companies
and the brands that I own.

27:16.130 --> 27:17.228
It's not for you.

27:17.263 --> 27:18.361
I got some big stuff for you.

27:18.396 --> 27:20.264
I got the big room for you.

27:20.299 --> 27:22.838
This is just
collaborations of brands

27:22.873 --> 27:25.269
I wanted to introduce
you to, you know,

27:25.304 --> 27:27.139
like I can partner with you.

27:27.174 --> 27:28.778
- Well, it's nice.

27:28.813 --> 27:29.779
It's not exactly
what I envisioned

27:29.814 --> 27:31.209
but what's that saying?

27:31.244 --> 27:33.145
"A shoddy craftsman
blames his tools."

27:34.819 --> 27:36.148
- I don't know what the
fuck you talking about

27:36.183 --> 27:38.348
but do you wanna
partner with Mac Woo?

27:38.383 --> 27:40.185
Macaroni and sushi?

27:40.220 --> 27:41.824
Bomb.

27:41.859 --> 27:43.892
- Oh, sure we're always
looking for sponsors.

27:43.927 --> 27:46.158
Yeah, I'm just really
excited to get going here.

27:46.193 --> 27:47.225
It's gonna be a great show.

27:47.260 --> 27:48.996
- Me too.

27:49.031 --> 27:50.932
And so when Ms.
Jeffries' cash that check

27:50.967 --> 27:53.869
and it go "cha-ching",
then we can go.

27:53.904 --> 27:57.840
Until then, you don't want
me and the Lord on your ass.

27:57.875 --> 27:59.237
- No, no I don't.

27:59.272 --> 28:01.371
- Don't don't make
me pray for you, boy.

28:01.406 --> 28:02.273
- Okay.

28:06.411 --> 28:08.147
Oh, come on! Namita!

28:08.182 --> 28:10.182
Can you please do
something about this light?

28:11.251 --> 28:12.954
- Hey, Walter, it's cool.

28:12.989 --> 28:14.054
I got this.

28:16.388 --> 28:18.025
- I'm sorry.

28:18.060 --> 28:19.928
We just got such a
big show planned.

28:19.963 --> 28:21.358
People are gonna be asking
you what are you doing here?

28:21.393 --> 28:23.360
They'll be all up in your grill.

28:23.395 --> 28:27.771
But fact of the matter is,
once we have our winner,

28:27.806 --> 28:31.170
we'll be able to edit this
together in a nice tight promo.

28:31.205 --> 28:33.337
And sell it to a
couple of investors

28:33.372 --> 28:35.075
I got coming out
on tournament day.

28:35.110 --> 28:37.748
So, everything goes as planned,

28:37.783 --> 28:39.442
we're gonna be in business.

28:39.477 --> 28:40.784
You really
think you can get this off

28:40.819 --> 28:41.477
without a hitch?

28:42.546 --> 28:43.919
- Well, you know what?

28:43.954 --> 28:47.351
I've pretty much
lost everything.

28:47.386 --> 28:51.025
So what's the worst
that could happen, huh?

28:51.060 --> 28:52.928
- His dumbass got no idea.

28:52.963 --> 28:54.160
- Follow me, ladies.

28:57.033 --> 28:58.428
I'm trying to tell y'all

28:58.463 --> 29:00.265
and then when we do
what we gotta do.

29:00.300 --> 29:02.872
What the fuck?

29:02.907 --> 29:04.467
Do you know who
the fuck that is?

29:04.502 --> 29:06.007
- No, cuz.

29:06.042 --> 29:06.843
- Well kick the
motherfucker in the ass!

29:06.878 --> 29:07.811
Get him!

29:15.854 --> 29:17.447
This is my brother!

29:17.482 --> 29:18.822
Ain't these some bad
motherfuckers, aint they?

29:18.857 --> 29:20.285
- You better tell them who I am!

29:20.320 --> 29:22.518
- Okay, calm down,
calm down, calm down.

29:22.553 --> 29:24.157
We don't need to
kill my brother.

29:24.192 --> 29:26.357
Boy, y'all are some bad
motherfuckers though.

29:26.392 --> 29:28.062
Now y'all get back over there.

29:28.097 --> 29:29.899
Take my keys, what we doing

29:34.268 --> 29:35.564
- This ain't WWF motherfucker!

29:35.599 --> 29:37.368
I'm gonna take your ass-

29:38.976 --> 29:40.437
- Hold on, killas!

29:40.472 --> 29:41.339
Calm down.

29:42.408 --> 29:43.946
There's plenty of ass to kick.

29:45.543 --> 29:47.114
It's cool, shit, hold up.

29:48.051 --> 29:49.512
This is important to me.

29:49.547 --> 29:52.482
Excuse me, she's calling me.

29:56.125 --> 29:58.059
Ain't nothing more beautiful

29:58.094 --> 30:00.094
than breaking a
motherfucking domino.

30:00.129 --> 30:02.459
When you break a
motherfucker in dominoes

30:02.494 --> 30:05.462
it's like breaking their
motherfucking soul!

30:09.303 --> 30:11.974
Let me show you
motherfuckers something.

30:12.009 --> 30:13.239
See this shit here?

30:17.608 --> 30:19.344
Y'all do this shit?

30:19.379 --> 30:20.213
- No.

30:20.248 --> 30:21.082
- No, thanks.

30:21.117 --> 30:21.984
You wanna start?

30:30.390 --> 30:33.193
It's like 37
orgasms at one time.

30:35.131 --> 30:37.395
Now, what we're gonna do,

30:38.970 --> 30:40.332
is this right here.

30:40.367 --> 30:41.234
Follow me.

30:46.571 --> 30:47.438
Look at it!

30:47.473 --> 30:48.439
Look around.

30:48.474 --> 30:49.605
Don't touch nothing!

30:55.679 --> 30:57.118
This right here, ladies,

31:00.057 --> 31:02.519
my greatest prized possession!

31:10.100 --> 31:10.967
Domino D.

31:12.498 --> 31:15.235
This motherfucker was
undefeated, never lost a game!

31:15.270 --> 31:19.140
I tore his ass up just when
he thought he had it made!

31:20.374 --> 31:21.571
And the nigga passed out.

31:22.508 --> 31:24.277
I went to his funeral.

31:24.312 --> 31:26.081
Best funeral I ever been to.

31:26.116 --> 31:27.676
Boy, I enjoyed it.

31:32.419 --> 31:33.319
Gerald Edges.

31:35.994 --> 31:39.061
I've been beating this
motherfucker his whole life.

31:40.196 --> 31:42.493
Even with his wife dying.

31:42.528 --> 31:44.363
I just don't give a fuck.

31:44.398 --> 31:46.200
I got his ring.

31:46.235 --> 31:48.400
I love beating
this motherfucker.

31:48.435 --> 31:51.172
And when I beat this dude again,

31:51.207 --> 31:53.075
my book will be complete!

31:57.345 --> 32:00.643
- Domino OG, I hate to do
it to you but I had to.

32:00.678 --> 32:02.216
- Ah, man.

32:02.251 --> 32:05.153
Man, Calvin, I'll
catch you little later.

32:05.188 --> 32:06.286
I'ma get you.

32:06.321 --> 32:07.155
All right, my man.

32:07.190 --> 32:07.584
- I'ma get you.

32:11.689 --> 32:13.128
- What's up, buzzard?

32:13.163 --> 32:14.965
- What's happening, man?

32:15.000 --> 32:15.966
blood,
what's happening, man?

32:16.001 --> 32:16.967
What you been doing?

32:17.002 --> 32:17.264
- Uh, nothing, nothing.

32:18.663 --> 32:20.498
I ain't seen you in
a good minute, bruh.

32:20.533 --> 32:22.269
I had probably thought
you were up and relocated

32:22.304 --> 32:24.139
or something.

32:24.174 --> 32:25.272
- Ah, shit, nah man. It just
happened like that, man.

32:25.307 --> 32:26.702
You know what I'm saying?

32:26.737 --> 32:28.539
I've been in the
wind, you feel me?

32:28.574 --> 32:30.310
I had to get relocated a little
bit, you what I'm saying?

32:30.345 --> 32:31.707
I'm out to play my priorities,
blood, you feel me?

32:31.742 --> 32:32.708
Prison, nigga.

32:32.743 --> 32:34.314
- Okay, right, right.

32:34.349 --> 32:36.481
I understand every word
you just said, man.

32:36.516 --> 32:37.482
- Shit, I see you're
still representing

32:37.517 --> 32:38.483
for the Swetto, blood.

32:38.518 --> 32:39.616
That's what's up.

32:39.651 --> 32:40.485
- Oh, for sure. For sure.

32:40.520 --> 32:42.355
I rep every day.

32:42.390 --> 32:44.390
I wake up in the morning saying
Sewoo-nothing but the blood!

32:44.425 --> 32:45.655
I even do them when I go to bed.

32:48.099 --> 32:49.758
- All right, what's up.

32:49.793 --> 32:51.364
I'd be happy to be free,
you know what I'm saying.

32:51.399 --> 32:53.168
'Cause like with
the Lord on my side,

32:53.203 --> 32:54.301
I can go down a righteous
path, you feel me?

32:54.336 --> 32:56.204
And put all that shit behind me.

32:56.239 --> 32:57.568
I'm tryna win this domino
tournament, you feel me?

32:57.603 --> 32:59.207
and get all the bread from that.

32:59.242 --> 33:00.670
And get my own spot.

33:00.705 --> 33:03.574
So right now, I'm
at the point where

33:03.609 --> 33:06.280
every time I think about beating
the shit out of somebody,

33:06.315 --> 33:09.349
I just rub my thumbs
against my earlobes

33:09.384 --> 33:11.021
and shit like this, right?

33:11.056 --> 33:13.551
And I just be like
"On bloods, nigga.

33:13.586 --> 33:15.454
Don't break this
nigga's chin on bloods."

33:15.489 --> 33:17.786
That shit be working
every time though.

33:17.821 --> 33:19.722
Not every time.

33:19.757 --> 33:21.328
Sometimes I still fuck a nigga
up but other than that nigga,

33:21.363 --> 33:23.594
I'm basically out here
living a zen life-

33:25.664 --> 33:27.235
- Oh shit.

33:29.701 --> 33:31.305
- Who the fuck threw
the ball at me?

33:32.242 --> 33:33.670
- I don't know, OG.

33:36.345 --> 33:37.740
- Throw me a shot.

33:44.716 --> 33:46.452
- Oh, hell no, shit!

34:16.781 --> 34:18.583
- Oh, why don't you
stay out of my business

34:18.618 --> 34:20.222
and off of the tables, kiddo.

34:20.257 --> 34:21.223
Because Dominica has
been embarrassing

34:21.258 --> 34:22.224
the whole family lately.

34:22.259 --> 34:23.423
- Who's Dominica?

34:23.458 --> 34:24.523
- My alter ego.

34:25.460 --> 34:27.361
Get out of my room.

34:33.336 --> 34:34.467
I'm a grown ass woman!

34:34.502 --> 34:35.635
- Sure doesn't look like it.

34:38.374 --> 34:40.473
- We just wanna know where
you're going

34:40.508 --> 34:43.080
- To practice for the
domino tournament tomorrow.

34:45.447 --> 34:46.743
What?

34:46.778 --> 34:47.843
Is that allowed?

34:48.780 --> 34:50.153
What do you think, Mom?

35:05.929 --> 35:08.600
- So why don't you follow your
mother's example for once?

35:08.635 --> 35:10.866
Respect the men of
the house, you know?

35:10.901 --> 35:12.769
- How about you find your balls

35:12.804 --> 35:15.541
or get my dad's out
of your fucking mouth!

35:29.557 --> 35:31.260
- Do I look okay, papa, huh?

35:34.859 --> 35:36.628
- I don't know how
to answer that.

35:38.665 --> 35:40.566
Why do you have to be this way?

35:40.601 --> 35:42.436
It's unnatural!

35:42.471 --> 35:44.900
You know, after a long
day's work, men come home.

35:44.935 --> 35:48.178
They like to unwind
over a game of bones.

35:48.213 --> 35:50.774
We should have
that right as men!

35:50.809 --> 35:53.909
Women, they have
their own sports even.

35:53.944 --> 35:56.285
Like volleyball.

35:56.320 --> 35:57.418
Ribbon dancing.

35:57.453 --> 35:58.881
Basket weaving.

35:58.916 --> 36:00.388
- Basket weaving, ha!

36:00.423 --> 36:01.290
For real?

36:02.920 --> 36:06.361
You guys can talk all the
misogynist shit you want

36:06.396 --> 36:08.891
but when I come back
holding this trophy,

36:08.926 --> 36:11.828
my seat at the table
will be undeniable!

36:11.863 --> 36:15.403
I'll be the best domino
player to carry the Ines name.

36:42.795 --> 36:43.761
- Andy!

36:43.796 --> 36:44.663
Come on, boy, wake up!

36:44.698 --> 36:45.796
It's time to go.

36:45.831 --> 36:46.434
We got a tournament to win.

37:00.549 --> 37:01.647
All right, boy, we got to
get there early and register.

37:01.682 --> 37:03.253
Then go over a few things.

37:03.288 --> 37:04.980
- We're not taking the car?

37:05.015 --> 37:06.883
- Why would we take a car when
it's just a couple of blocks?

37:06.918 --> 37:09.754
Gas is as high as a
giraffe's coochie.

37:09.789 --> 37:10.953
- Granddad.
- You better hurry up.

37:10.988 --> 37:12.724
- Wait up.

37:12.759 --> 37:13.923
- Unless you got
navigation on that phone.

37:13.958 --> 37:16.332
And I ain't your damn granddad.

37:17.665 --> 37:18.862
Hurry up boy!

37:18.897 --> 37:20.303
I'm on a mission.

37:20.338 --> 37:21.931
I'm gonna take this bitch down.

37:21.966 --> 37:24.373
And this is gonna be it.

37:24.408 --> 37:26.034
Me and Tenspeed.

37:26.069 --> 37:28.575
I'm coming for you!

37:28.610 --> 37:30.841
- Worst day of my fucking
life, you feel me?

37:30.876 --> 37:32.513
Worst.

37:32.548 --> 37:33.910
- You know you're still white

37:33.945 --> 37:35.516
even though you
wear Nike's, right?

37:35.551 --> 37:36.913
- Man, pay attention
what I'm saying!

37:36.948 --> 37:38.783
- My bad, nigga, my bad.

37:38.818 --> 37:40.422
- What I'm saying is, before
I even could do anything

37:40.457 --> 37:41.687
she walked in on me
with her sister, man.

37:41.722 --> 37:42.820
Fucked up.

37:42.855 --> 37:44.756
- Ah, man, what'd you say?

37:44.791 --> 37:46.395
- Man, I said I was trying
to get to know her family

37:46.430 --> 37:47.825
a little better, you
know what I'm saying?

37:47.860 --> 37:48.991
Get a little relations
with the relatives,

37:49.026 --> 37:50.960
you know what I'm saying?

37:50.995 --> 37:51.961
- Shit, nigga, did it work?

37:51.996 --> 37:53.831
- No, it didn't work!

37:53.866 --> 37:55.503
I can't take my advice from
Shaggy songs, my nigga.

37:55.538 --> 37:56.504
That only works for
light skinned niggas

37:56.539 --> 37:57.274
with their shirts off.

38:00.840 --> 38:02.543
Hey, did you just
see this Rastafari

38:02.578 --> 38:03.973
with this check right here?

38:04.008 --> 38:05.612
- You know how many
Nike's and tattoos

38:05.647 --> 38:06.613
that he can buy
with that, nigga?

38:06.648 --> 38:07.746
- That's 10 thou-wow!

38:07.781 --> 38:09.748
- Oh we about to get it, nigga.

38:24.061 --> 38:25.698
- What kind of ghetto
ass operation is this,

38:25.733 --> 38:27.095
not having a ramp
for my wheelchair?

38:27.130 --> 38:28.734
Y'all trying to kill the king

38:28.769 --> 38:30.538
before I get a chance
to sit in my throne?

38:30.573 --> 38:32.474
So who do I need to
make wild passionate

38:32.509 --> 38:35.675
chittlin grease love to to
get some water up in here?

38:36.711 --> 38:38.579
Oh my god!

38:38.614 --> 38:39.712
Just let his
body completely shut down

38:39.747 --> 38:41.384
and reboot itself stronger.

38:41.419 --> 38:42.814
That's the way real
black slaves did it.

38:42.849 --> 38:45.047
And you're welcome for
the history lesson.

38:45.082 --> 38:46.114
- You poor thing.

38:46.149 --> 38:47.885
Are you okay?

38:47.920 --> 38:48.919
- Thank you.

38:49.823 --> 38:50.756
I love you.

38:52.023 --> 38:53.561
- Okay.

38:53.596 --> 38:55.464
- I mean, I'm Andy.

38:55.499 --> 38:56.564
- Have some water.

39:01.098 --> 39:02.702
- Hi, I'm Andy.

39:02.737 --> 39:03.868
- Get out of my
fucking way, kid!

39:14.782 --> 39:17.882
- Look, you can't be
going around with my
name in your mouth

39:17.917 --> 39:19.554
acting softer than baby shit.

39:19.589 --> 39:22.392
You got to take
pride in yourself.

39:22.427 --> 39:23.822
You wanna be a Edges?

39:23.857 --> 39:26.825
You don't take nothing
off of nobody, ever.

39:32.129 --> 39:32.996
Shit.

39:35.638 --> 39:39.035
- Ladies and gentlemen,
Tenspeed is in the building.

39:57.462 --> 39:59.858
- Ha, if it ain't the S.N.I.C!

40:04.898 --> 40:06.964
You know what that means,
little white fella?

40:06.999 --> 40:07.833
- No.

40:08.869 --> 40:09.703
- Well, let me tell you.

40:11.003 --> 40:14.444
If it ain't the saddest
nigga in Compton,

40:14.479 --> 40:15.742
Gerald motherfucking Edges.

40:17.779 --> 40:18.712
- Tenspeed.

40:20.243 --> 40:22.749
I see that rehab
went terribly bad.

40:24.049 --> 40:25.950
- The judge must've
been on drugs.

40:25.985 --> 40:28.117
He shouldn't have been trying
to stop me from doing cocaine.

40:28.152 --> 40:29.822
I love cocaine, nigga.

40:29.857 --> 40:31.758
That's not what this is about.

40:31.793 --> 40:34.431
This is about if you think
you finna come to Compton

40:35.533 --> 40:39.194
and take my victory from me.

40:39.229 --> 40:42.571
See, let me explain something
to you about winning.

40:42.606 --> 40:46.773
Only a loser would lose
something so precious.

40:46.808 --> 40:47.906
You're a loser, Gerald.

40:47.941 --> 40:49.809
You can't fool a nigga like me.

40:49.844 --> 40:53.945
You lost the most precious
thing that God gave to man.

40:55.520 --> 40:56.783
That you vowed that
you could keep it

40:56.818 --> 40:57.949
and you lost it!

40:59.524 --> 41:02.492
When you get your ass
played at dominoes,

41:02.527 --> 41:04.692
you think about this.

41:04.727 --> 41:06.221
It's 2020.

41:07.730 --> 41:10.500
You run around
here like it's 1974

41:10.535 --> 41:12.931
with all that goddam chest
hair on your goddam chest.

41:12.966 --> 41:14.570
You look ridiculous!

41:14.605 --> 41:16.803
You need to get a tattoo
that says "Flammable".

41:17.971 --> 41:19.234
I love this shit.

41:25.110 --> 41:25.977
- Come on, Andy.

41:31.050 --> 41:32.786
- Don't worry, Grandad.

41:32.821 --> 41:34.249
No matter what it takes,

41:34.284 --> 41:35.921
if it means bending
the rules a little,

41:35.956 --> 41:37.956
I'm gonna help you
bury his second rate

41:37.991 --> 41:40.024
Scooby Doo villain looking ass.

41:40.059 --> 41:43.093
Because Edges stand up
for themselves, right?

41:44.668 --> 41:46.932
- You damn skippy, my
little soda cracker.

41:51.741 --> 41:54.170
- Look at all this sweet shit!

41:54.205 --> 41:56.909
Hell, look at all
these goddam brownies.

41:56.944 --> 41:58.878
Trying to fuck up
my blood pressure.

41:58.913 --> 42:00.176
All this sweet shit.

42:00.211 --> 42:03.586
Let me add a little,

42:03.621 --> 42:06.116
a little flavor to this.

42:06.151 --> 42:07.656
Tenspeed flavor.

42:08.956 --> 42:10.054
Don't want to put too much...

42:10.089 --> 42:11.891
Just balance my blood sugar.

42:22.068 --> 42:23.034
- Name please.

42:23.069 --> 42:25.333
- Slams. S-L-A-M-S.

42:25.368 --> 42:27.940
- Oh, sorry, your
birth name, sir?

42:27.975 --> 42:31.273
- Oh, that's
Rutherford Wrinkleton.

42:33.376 --> 42:35.277
- Really?

42:35.312 --> 42:37.114
- Yeah, it's on my parole
bar, you know what I mean?

42:37.149 --> 42:38.247
I just got out.

42:38.282 --> 42:39.952
You know, I did like a quick 10.

42:39.987 --> 42:41.151
I don't even know what's
bracking these days.

42:41.186 --> 42:42.185
What you like to do?

42:43.793 --> 42:45.320
You like going to the binema?

42:45.355 --> 42:46.959
- Sorry, what?

42:46.994 --> 42:48.895
- The movies, you like
going to the movies?

42:48.930 --> 42:49.896
- Oh, mm-hmm.

42:49.931 --> 42:51.832
- Okay, bull, bull.

42:51.867 --> 42:53.933
So maybe after this, we can
go catch like a

42:53.968 --> 42:55.605
matinee or something?

42:55.640 --> 42:58.608
- I'm more of a Netflix
& chill girl, honestly.

42:59.875 --> 43:01.171
- All right, Netflix is bull.

43:01.206 --> 43:02.942
I could do that, what's that?

43:02.977 --> 43:03.943
That's the new shit?

43:03.978 --> 43:05.076
Okay, I'm with that.

43:05.111 --> 43:06.077
My name right there though.

43:07.113 --> 43:08.717
- Excuse me, miss!

43:08.752 --> 43:10.620
I'm gonna need you
to hold on a second.

43:10.655 --> 43:11.280
I'm gonna need you to step
over here for a second,

43:11.315 --> 43:12.149
big fella.

43:12.184 --> 43:13.755
Random search!

43:13.790 --> 43:15.185
- I really don't think
that's necessary.

43:15.220 --> 43:16.989
- I rolled a dice and
his number came up!

43:17.024 --> 43:18.628
I want you to know I'm extremely
proficient with a taser.

43:18.663 --> 43:20.223
And I have a certificate.

43:20.258 --> 43:21.763
I'm gonna need you to
assume the position

43:21.798 --> 43:22.764
I'm sure you're familiar.

43:22.799 --> 43:23.897
Please spread them!

43:23.932 --> 43:25.635
- Oh my god this is ridiculous!

43:25.670 --> 43:26.867
- What's going on here!

43:26.902 --> 43:27.868
Is this a weapon?

43:27.903 --> 43:28.869
Is this a weapon?

43:28.904 --> 43:30.002
Are you moving suddenly?

43:30.037 --> 43:31.366
Do not move suddenly, sir!

43:31.401 --> 43:32.972
Calm down!

43:33.007 --> 43:33.973
- I got this under
control ma'am!

43:34.008 --> 43:34.611
- It's a spork, blood.

43:35.680 --> 43:36.712
I don't do forks no more, man.

43:36.747 --> 43:37.713
They too sharp.

43:37.748 --> 43:39.176
And spoons are too dull.

43:39.211 --> 43:41.079
That's a hybrid utensil, blood.

43:42.687 --> 43:43.345
- A spork.

43:45.184 --> 43:47.184
All right, I'm gonna need to
take this one to the back.

43:47.219 --> 43:48.053
- Why?

43:48.088 --> 43:49.417
Why?

43:49.452 --> 43:50.693
Ma'am, let me do my job!

43:50.728 --> 43:51.353
I have an online degree!

43:51.388 --> 43:52.695
- No!

43:52.730 --> 43:53.696
- All right, full cavity search.

43:53.731 --> 43:54.356
- The fuck you say?

43:54.391 --> 43:55.698
- Stand down!

43:55.733 --> 43:56.864
Don't you know who this is?

43:58.230 --> 44:01.198
This is legendary
Bonesmith Big Slams.

44:01.233 --> 44:02.298
From the D Block.

44:02.333 --> 44:03.739
Come on, G.

44:04.973 --> 44:06.940
I am so sorry, Mr. Slams.

44:08.141 --> 44:09.745
- It's bull.

44:09.780 --> 44:11.439
- It is not bull,
it is not bull.

44:11.474 --> 44:13.078
We're gonna treat you like
the pampered prince you are.

44:13.113 --> 44:15.850
We're gonna make sure
you get all the L'Croix

44:15.885 --> 44:18.985
and hand sanitizer your
massive heart can handle.

44:19.020 --> 44:20.855
All right?

44:20.890 --> 44:22.791
And some cocoa butter so
your elbows don't get ashy.

44:22.826 --> 44:25.057
I know, 'cause I
get ashy elbows.

44:25.092 --> 44:28.126
Little known fact,
white guys get ashy too!

44:29.195 --> 44:31.063
Yeah, it's true, it's true.

44:31.098 --> 44:33.461
All right, come on Namita,
let's get him his name tag.

44:33.496 --> 44:35.232
What are you doing?

44:35.267 --> 44:36.233
Give me that.

44:36.268 --> 44:37.267
What's wrong with you?

44:37.302 --> 44:39.104
How would you like it?

44:39.139 --> 44:40.072
Jeez-ah!

44:41.174 --> 44:42.338
Put that away!

44:42.373 --> 44:43.240
- Walter!

44:43.275 --> 44:44.241
- Harold.

44:44.276 --> 44:45.242
- How's it going?

44:45.277 --> 44:46.375
- You must be Quinton?

44:46.410 --> 44:47.882
- Yeah, it Quilton, actually.

44:47.917 --> 44:48.949
- Quilton?

44:48.984 --> 44:50.313
- Yeah, like a quilt.

44:50.348 --> 44:54.020
- Oh, and your parents
named you that?

44:54.055 --> 44:55.384
- Family names.

44:55.419 --> 44:56.792
- Very artistic!

44:58.224 --> 45:00.059
You know what, Namita?

45:00.094 --> 45:03.293
why don't get these guys
the VIP pizza rolls,

45:03.328 --> 45:05.064
that little area?

45:05.099 --> 45:06.736
And give them triple pepperoni!

45:06.771 --> 45:07.869
On the house.

45:07.904 --> 45:10.300
Enjoy. Here we go, there it is.

45:10.335 --> 45:12.808
Hey, and everyone,
I want y'all to know

45:12.843 --> 45:15.910
that black lives
absolutely matter!

45:16.880 --> 45:18.748
Probably more than ours!

45:18.783 --> 45:20.816
Definitely more than ours!

45:20.851 --> 45:23.511
I mean, haven't we
screwed it up enough?

45:25.482 --> 45:29.286
So, black lives matter at
this tournament especially.

45:33.028 --> 45:34.995
Big Slams is coming up fired up.

45:39.496 --> 45:41.463
Man, I get mad about that.

45:41.498 --> 45:43.531
Am I the only one
that misses Obama?

45:43.566 --> 45:45.104
Am I right here?

45:45.139 --> 45:46.776
Jeez!

45:47.944 --> 45:48.811
That guy had it going on.

45:50.375 --> 45:53.211
And Michelle, can we
talk about Michelle?

45:59.923 --> 46:02.286
- This is the most beautiful
shit I've ever seen.

46:15.037 --> 46:16.564
I'ma get you.

46:32.219 --> 46:33.119
- You good?

46:34.188 --> 46:35.990
- Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

46:36.025 --> 46:37.420
I'm just looking for
somebody for registration,

46:37.455 --> 46:39.092
you know what I'm saying?

46:39.127 --> 46:40.555
This is the Domino
Tournament, right?

46:40.590 --> 46:41.556
- Absolutely, this is
the Domino Tournament.

46:41.591 --> 46:43.327
I'm a domino tournament.

46:43.362 --> 46:44.966
- You know, I'm a child prodigy.

46:45.001 --> 46:47.166
Look, I'm a long line
of domino champion.

46:47.201 --> 46:48.167
You know what I'm saying?

46:48.202 --> 46:49.597
- You're a prodigy?

46:49.632 --> 46:51.500
- Yeah. I ain't lost
since I was three.

46:51.535 --> 46:53.172
- I'm just here brother,
I'm just here to help you.

46:53.207 --> 46:54.173
Matter fact, since
you're a prodigy,

46:54.208 --> 46:55.240
I got something for you.

46:55.275 --> 46:56.879
I wanna welcome you.

46:56.914 --> 46:58.012
Take one of these
bralettes, man.

46:58.047 --> 46:59.145
Registration right there.

46:59.180 --> 47:00.278
And make yourself at home.

47:00.313 --> 47:01.884
This is what this is about.

47:01.919 --> 47:03.413
- All right man,
thank you, brother.

47:03.448 --> 47:04.546
- A prodigy.

47:04.581 --> 47:06.185
- Well, I appreciate that, man.

47:06.220 --> 47:07.318
- Matter of fact, you
take two, take two.

47:07.353 --> 47:08.924
- Oh man, thank you, man.

47:08.959 --> 47:10.156
I ain't know it was
gonna be like this man.

47:10.191 --> 47:11.223
- You know I got your back man.

47:11.258 --> 47:12.257
- Oh man, thank you.

47:12.292 --> 47:13.159
- Yes.

47:15.262 --> 47:17.625
- What's up buddy.
- Hi.

47:17.660 --> 47:19.561
- I need to holler at you.

47:19.596 --> 47:22.630
You got an appointment with
one of Jesus' disciples.

47:22.665 --> 47:25.105
Let's go.

47:25.140 --> 47:26.337
- It's starting to pick up.

47:26.372 --> 47:27.206
It's getting hot.

47:27.241 --> 47:28.075
I'm excited.

47:28.110 --> 47:29.175
Oh thank you.

47:30.211 --> 47:31.606
- Do you love the Lord?

47:31.641 --> 47:33.278
- Oh yes, I love the
Lord, hallelujah.

47:33.313 --> 47:35.181
Praise the Lord.

47:35.216 --> 47:37.084
- You know, because the
Lord says, don't be cruel,

47:38.450 --> 47:41.418
'cause I will never
be that cruel to you.

47:41.453 --> 47:43.057
You know.

47:43.092 --> 47:44.190
said
it's my prerogative.

47:45.127 --> 47:45.961
You know?

47:45.996 --> 47:46.995
- Didn't Bobby--

47:48.691 --> 47:49.558
- You're coming up in
here with bounced checks,

47:49.593 --> 47:51.131
playing with me.

47:51.166 --> 47:52.165
You thinks this is a game?

47:52.200 --> 47:53.463
- No, no, no.

47:53.498 --> 47:54.464
It's not a game.

47:54.499 --> 47:56.103
Listen, about that,

47:56.138 --> 47:57.071
my wife, she must've put
a block on my account,

47:57.106 --> 47:58.633
but good news,

47:58.668 --> 48:00.635
I've got the gate money.

48:01.704 --> 48:02.538
You can take that.

48:02.573 --> 48:03.407
You can have it.

48:03.442 --> 48:05.013
- Gate money?

48:05.048 --> 48:06.146
Oh, you're
giving me permission

48:06.181 --> 48:06.641
to have my own fucking money?

48:08.381 --> 48:10.645
I will cut a mother fucking
pie hole out of you.

48:10.680 --> 48:12.251
- Hold on.

48:12.286 --> 48:13.120
- You know what I mean,
you scared of this?

48:14.024 --> 48:15.122
- Yeah, yeah.

48:15.157 --> 48:16.552
- Guess what, guess what?

48:16.587 --> 48:17.685
I got three, 50
pound cockroaches.

48:17.720 --> 48:19.060
The size of pit bulls right

48:21.295 --> 48:22.129
You hear me?

48:22.164 --> 48:22.998
- Cockroaches?

48:23.033 --> 48:24.065
- Yeah, yeah.

48:24.100 --> 48:25.066
- God, no.

48:25.101 --> 48:26.463
- Hey, what?

48:26.498 --> 48:28.102
Oh, you're gonna use
the Lord's name in vain?

48:28.137 --> 48:29.037
- No.
- Huh?

48:29.072 --> 48:30.170
- I didn't.

48:30.205 --> 48:31.303
- In my fucking establishment?

48:31.338 --> 48:33.338
Do you know I'm a man of God?

48:33.373 --> 48:34.977
- Clearly.

48:35.012 --> 48:37.177
- You got till 4:00
PM to come up with

48:37.212 --> 48:39.047
my mother fucking scratch.

48:39.082 --> 48:40.477
- Okay.

48:40.512 --> 48:41.610
- Or I'ma have these
these cockroaches

48:41.645 --> 48:42.479
bite the shit out of you.

48:42.514 --> 48:43.480
You hear me?

48:45.484 --> 48:47.253
Oh Lord, forgive me.

48:49.092 --> 48:50.993
- Cockroach, cockroaches?

49:07.605 --> 49:09.605
- Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for coming out.

49:09.640 --> 49:11.310
Oh, hi there.

49:13.149 --> 49:15.380
So we're getting about to
get started in a minute.

49:15.415 --> 49:17.382
Oh look, we got some
hotties coming in.

49:19.221 --> 49:21.089
Just want y'all to know
we're gonna get this show

49:21.124 --> 49:22.090
on the road.

49:22.125 --> 49:22.750
So just sit back.

49:22.785 --> 49:24.422
Yeah, sit back.

49:24.457 --> 49:25.324
Time to party.

49:27.559 --> 49:29.966
All right, let's hear
from DJ Dominoes.

49:30.694 --> 49:31.561
- Oh yeah.

49:32.630 --> 49:34.003
Y'all know what time it is.

49:34.038 --> 49:36.269
It's your girl DJ Dominoes.

49:38.735 --> 49:43.078
I'm here to drop knowledge
and drop some dope sport beat.

49:44.675 --> 49:47.775
- Not trying to hate, but I
taught her everything she knows.

49:47.810 --> 49:49.414
Facts.

49:49.449 --> 49:51.350
- Let's take a look at
our strongest contenders

49:51.385 --> 49:53.121
as we enter the first round.

49:53.156 --> 49:55.024
On table one, we have Tenspeed.

49:55.059 --> 49:57.356
The highest ranked player
according to Liberty Parks,

49:57.391 --> 49:58.786
top 10 winners.

49:58.821 --> 50:01.195
He's most famously
here for his ability

50:01.230 --> 50:04.528
to mind fuck opponents,
hard and deep

50:04.563 --> 50:05.793
with no lubrication, y'all.

50:05.828 --> 50:07.597
- Somebody move all your asses.

50:07.632 --> 50:10.336
- Then there's big
slams on table two.

50:10.371 --> 50:13.042
Who've been locked up
for the last 14 years

50:13.077 --> 50:14.439
and it has shit else
to do but play bones

50:14.474 --> 50:16.573
for 23 hours in his cell.

50:16.608 --> 50:20.214
And on table three,
got Camilla Ines.

50:20.249 --> 50:23.811
Known for her lewd and
downright nasty trash talk.

50:23.846 --> 50:26.286
Oh, Ines is getting personal.

50:26.321 --> 50:28.684
It looks like a family
rivalry is a brew

50:28.719 --> 50:32.556
as her cousin Fredrico,
a big time champ himself

50:32.591 --> 50:34.426
sits at table four.

50:35.825 --> 50:38.760
On table five, we've
got Pimpdaddy fresh,

50:38.795 --> 50:43.270
a retired pimp whose fashion
sense is a mix of mace,

50:43.305 --> 50:45.734
bargain, late 2000s.

50:45.769 --> 50:47.571
We don't really know.

50:47.606 --> 50:49.474
But it doesn't seem like
Pimpdaddy has his opponent yet

50:49.509 --> 50:52.114
as we wonder where the
great veteran Gerald Edges

50:52.149 --> 50:53.379
has disappeared to?

50:53.414 --> 50:55.249
Somebody find me a man.

50:57.748 --> 50:59.418
Are you hanging out
with aunt Jemimah?

50:59.453 --> 51:00.518
What's you doing?

51:00.553 --> 51:02.322
- All right.

51:02.357 --> 51:04.225
So you have a flip
phone, so texting is out.

51:04.260 --> 51:06.128
Okay, this is three, five.

51:09.496 --> 51:11.397
This is four, six.

51:15.568 --> 51:18.239
And if you have any doubles,

51:18.274 --> 51:22.309
it can be, oh, Lord,
it's hot in here.

51:22.344 --> 51:23.145
All right?

51:23.180 --> 51:24.575
Get it?

51:24.610 --> 51:26.544
- Yeah, I got it, I'm
black and I see now,

51:26.579 --> 51:28.315
and it ain't that
damn difficult.

51:28.350 --> 51:30.680
- Yeah, it's not like
talking with girls

51:30.715 --> 51:33.386
or anything like that, right?

51:33.421 --> 51:35.520
- Hell you're talking about?

51:35.555 --> 51:38.523
- Well, I was just wondering

51:38.558 --> 51:40.459
if I help you with dominoes,

51:41.792 --> 51:44.793
maybe you can help
me learn about women?

51:44.828 --> 51:46.432
- Oh, shucks.

51:46.467 --> 51:47.763
Hormones raging, huh?

51:49.602 --> 51:54.308
Okay, ain't nothing
more beautiful in life

51:54.343 --> 51:56.244
than finding the
love of a good woman

51:57.643 --> 51:58.675
'cause you'll never
be able to find one

51:58.710 --> 52:00.281
half as good as mine

52:00.316 --> 52:01.711
'cause my Ella May
was the greatest woman

52:01.746 --> 52:03.614
that ever graced
this green earth.

52:03.649 --> 52:06.188
Having love is like pure magic.

52:08.753 --> 52:10.291
There's no greater feeling.

52:12.493 --> 52:15.692
Losing it is like a
repeated kick in the ass

52:15.727 --> 52:17.595
with a steel toed boot.

52:18.730 --> 52:21.401
That damn Tenspeed got her ring.

52:21.436 --> 52:23.568
That's the only memory
of her I got left.

52:24.637 --> 52:26.736
I don't wanna lose it for life.

52:26.771 --> 52:28.606
Not while I'm still half alive.

52:30.478 --> 52:33.215
He beat him in the losing
in last tournament.

52:33.250 --> 52:35.283
We got to win it back.

52:35.318 --> 52:36.746
- All right, let's get it back.

52:38.486 --> 52:42.488
But what you were
talking about with girls,

52:42.523 --> 52:44.655
I think I found my Ella May.

52:44.690 --> 52:47.691
- Look, we don't have
a lot of time left,

52:47.726 --> 52:50.793
so we're gonna have to do
a crash course, all right?

52:50.828 --> 52:52.333
Two things I'ma give you.

52:59.001 --> 53:01.738
- And lastly, about you
random motherfuckers

53:01.773 --> 53:03.377
who are definitely gonna lose.

53:06.811 --> 53:08.679
It looks like Gerald
Edges has finally decided

53:08.714 --> 53:10.846
to come on through and play.

53:12.751 --> 53:13.519
- Uncle Ben.

53:14.852 --> 53:17.259
Did you just climb
out of your rice box?

53:17.294 --> 53:18.689
Man. I want all these
beautiful people

53:18.724 --> 53:20.724
to watch me whoop your ass.

53:20.759 --> 53:22.957
And there ain't gon' be no
sympathy here Papa Bones.

53:22.992 --> 53:25.729
Although, I would like
to formally thank you

53:25.764 --> 53:28.303
for the invention
of peanut butter.

53:28.338 --> 53:29.700
That shit is good as fuck.

53:29.735 --> 53:32.439
Especially with jelly, goddam.

53:32.474 --> 53:33.836
George
Washingtonlooking
ass.

53:33.871 --> 53:35.409
- Lemme tell you what.

53:35.444 --> 53:36.542
- What?

53:36.577 --> 53:38.005
- Get on up, so we can get down.

53:38.040 --> 53:39.974
- Oh man. What was
that from the 50s?

53:40.009 --> 53:41.745
Goddam, get on up
so we can get down.

53:41.780 --> 53:43.879
There were no cars
when you was born, sir.

53:43.914 --> 53:45.386
- All right, all
right, all right.

53:45.421 --> 53:47.289
About to play some dominoes.

53:47.324 --> 53:48.554
And no sore losers up in here.

53:48.589 --> 53:49.753
Y'all got it?

53:49.788 --> 53:51.425
Let's keep it cute, Compton.

53:52.329 --> 53:53.757
Let's get it.

53:55.530 --> 53:57.024
I'm about to tear your ass up.

53:57.059 --> 53:58.366
- Come on with
the big six again.

53:58.401 --> 54:00.599
Is this sponsored by ARP?

54:00.634 --> 54:02.370
- Got you right there.

54:03.967 --> 54:04.999
Come on.

54:05.034 --> 54:05.868
What you got?

54:05.903 --> 54:06.770
- Nickel.

54:07.905 --> 54:08.838
- Nickel.

54:11.612 --> 54:12.941
- Alfred Lord Tennyson.

54:13.878 --> 54:15.251
- What the fuck that is.

54:16.815 --> 54:18.980
How does that feel, Gerald?

54:19.015 --> 54:20.586
Painful?

54:20.621 --> 54:22.489
Do you got your
arthritis acting up?

54:22.524 --> 54:26.823
- Oh, a dumb ass mistake
from Gerald Edges.

54:26.858 --> 54:28.396
He must be getting old

54:28.431 --> 54:31.300
or is it that
dementia kicking in?

54:31.335 --> 54:32.400
- What's wrong pops?

54:32.435 --> 54:33.434
Come on man.

54:35.834 --> 54:37.933
Ah, that's right.

54:37.968 --> 54:41.035
Circle of life Mufasa, the old

Your time is up.

54:48.814 --> 54:50.979

54:59.495 --> 55:00.494
Guess what?

55:00.529 --> 55:01.924

55:01.959 --> 55:03.794
- I ain't scared
of your bitch ass.

55:03.829 --> 55:06.060
My momma told me all about you.

55:06.095 --> 55:08.502
You ain't nothing but a
motherfucking crack head.

55:08.537 --> 55:10.603
- All this time I've been
fucking your mama nigga

55:10.638 --> 55:12.539

telling you about me bitch?

55:12.574 --> 55:14.035
And it should have been your
daddy that told you about me

55:14.070 --> 55:15.377
motherfucker.

55:15.412 --> 55:16.510
And just don't disrespect me

55:16.545 --> 55:17.643
with an unlit cigarette

55:17.678 --> 55:19.106

55:24.146 --> 55:25.948
Come on, I defeat
everything I do.

55:25.983 --> 55:27.620
And next time I fuck your mama,

55:27.655 --> 55:29.457
I'ma tell her to keep
your ass in the house.

55:30.427 --> 55:31.052
- 10.

55:31.087 --> 55:32.658
- 15.

55:32.693 --> 55:33.791
- First of all, I didn't
hear shit you said.

55:33.826 --> 55:35.694
Is your mustache too big?

55:35.729 --> 55:36.893
And I will suck your bitch ass
but you ain't gonna feel it.

55:36.928 --> 55:38.499
- Oh you're a genius, huh?

55:38.534 --> 55:39.962
You real slick with your

you little irrelevant
motherfucker.

55:43.033 --> 55:44.604
20.

55:44.639 --> 55:46.067
It ain't never too
late for an abortion.

55:46.102 --> 55:47.442
So you should shut
your goddam mouth.

55:47.477 --> 55:48.641
You see what I'm saying?

55:48.676 --> 55:50.104
- What?

55:50.139 --> 55:51.545
- Dominoes, that's
what motherfucker.

55:53.813 --> 55:55.516
- I'm about to tear your ass up.

55:55.551 --> 55:58.046
- 46, 46 trombones
in the big parade.

56:02.492 --> 56:03.755
- It looks like
I spoke too soon.

56:03.790 --> 56:04.987
Gerald is racking up points.

56:05.022 --> 56:06.758
- The fuck he is.

56:06.793 --> 56:07.660
- Very white.

56:08.795 --> 56:09.860

56:09.895 --> 56:11.796

56:11.831 --> 56:13.061
- Hey.

56:13.096 --> 56:14.601
- Sorry, I have Tourette's.

56:17.001 --> 56:17.901
Tickle that teat.

56:18.970 --> 56:20.101
- Security, security.

56:21.643 --> 56:23.038
- Oysters.

56:23.073 --> 56:25.678
- Some kind of commotion
going on in the crowd.

56:25.713 --> 56:27.779
We're gonna have the
monitors take a look.

56:27.814 --> 56:30.045
- 25 big booty bitches bouncing.

56:33.622 --> 56:35.919
Shocker, shocker, doing
the pink, what a stink.

56:38.660 --> 56:40.495
- Dominoes.

56:40.530 --> 56:41.661
- Stop.

56:46.602 --> 56:47.997
- Tell your
grandmamma I said hey.

56:48.032 --> 56:49.867
She'll remember me.

56:49.902 --> 56:52.738
- And a huge come from behind
victory from Gerald Edges.

56:52.773 --> 56:54.641
Congratulations.

56:54.676 --> 56:55.675
You must start taking your
fish oil halfway through

56:55.710 --> 56:56.742
I see that.

56:58.680 --> 57:01.142
Ooh, Camilla Ines is looking
surprisingly shaky out there.

57:02.948 --> 57:04.816
- You know, I've been meaning
to ask you this all game.

57:04.851 --> 57:06.752
Aside from the fact
that you are dressed

57:06.787 --> 57:08.820
like Cleo from "Set It Off,"

57:08.855 --> 57:10.118
how does it work when
you're in the bathroom?

57:10.153 --> 57:11.724
Like are you standing up?

57:11.759 --> 57:12.857
Are you sitting down?

57:12.892 --> 57:13.858
Are you on there backwards?

57:13.893 --> 57:15.497
What are you doing?

57:15.532 --> 57:16.795
- Well, I'll be
standing only when

57:16.830 --> 57:18.566
it's in your momma's mouth.

57:21.703 --> 57:22.570
- Nasty.

57:23.936 --> 57:25.738
- You should make
sure you hold onto her

57:25.773 --> 57:26.838
before you lose her.

57:27.775 --> 57:29.038
Call her and shit.

57:29.073 --> 57:30.710
All right?

57:30.745 --> 57:31.810
- What?

57:31.845 --> 57:32.910
Are you good?

57:32.945 --> 57:34.516
Are you okay?

57:34.551 --> 57:36.210
Are you having a mental
breakdown right now?

57:36.245 --> 57:39.015
Are you suffering
from identity crisis?

57:39.050 --> 57:41.083
You wanna write your
feelings in your diary?

57:41.118 --> 57:42.150
Huh?

57:42.185 --> 57:43.756
Go ahead, you got time.

57:43.791 --> 57:45.153
You can have a
whole lot of time.

57:45.188 --> 57:47.595
I'm just be over here,
spanking that ass.

57:49.225 --> 57:51.896
Who the hell invited Mr. old
town road to this tournament?

57:51.931 --> 57:54.030
See, this is gentrification
at its finest.

57:54.065 --> 57:54.899
I'm telling you.

57:54.934 --> 57:55.900
- Miguel, right?

57:55.935 --> 57:56.901
- Vandersloot, right?

57:56.936 --> 57:57.770
- Good to see you.

57:57.805 --> 57:58.771
- You too, man.

57:58.806 --> 57:59.772
You build that wall yet?

57:59.807 --> 58:00.674
- Working on it.

58:02.106 --> 58:02.940
Let it rip.

58:02.975 --> 58:04.073
- Boom.

58:04.108 --> 58:05.712
There you go, Willie Nelson.

58:05.747 --> 58:07.076
Come on, let me see
what you on there.

58:07.111 --> 58:09.045
- Well, it's anything
like last time.

58:09.080 --> 58:10.882
You know exactly how this goes.

58:10.917 --> 58:15.051
- Mmh okay, that means I'm
gonna leave out of here a winner

58:15.086 --> 58:16.987
and you get to go
back to your cousins.

58:17.022 --> 58:18.956
That's exactly what that means.

58:21.125 --> 58:22.861
Boom, there we go.

58:22.896 --> 58:23.763
- Okay.

58:25.635 --> 58:30.033
- 15, put a lasso around
your ass for that one, huh?

58:30.068 --> 58:34.301
- Hey, well, sorry to
disappoint you 'cause,

58:34.336 --> 58:35.203
domino bitch.

58:36.107 --> 58:37.678
That's right.

58:37.713 --> 58:39.548
Oh, you're gonna
cry now, aren't you?

58:39.583 --> 58:41.044
Look, I know it hurts.

58:42.619 --> 58:44.014
Willie Nelson
looking motherfucker.

58:44.049 --> 58:45.950
Come on, get out of here.

58:45.985 --> 58:48.315
to the hell out of here

58:48.350 --> 58:50.185
Get yo ass up out
the damn chair.

58:50.220 --> 58:52.055
That's right.

58:52.090 --> 58:54.728
- Seems like it's officially
national douche bag day

58:54.763 --> 58:59.194
as Fredrico wins his
first game, advancing on.

59:00.362 --> 59:02.131
Camilla still struggling.

59:02.166 --> 59:04.903
- You know, I hope
you learn from this.

59:04.938 --> 59:07.268
I truly, truly hope
you learn from this

59:07.303 --> 59:10.337
and find out what
happened when you fuck

59:10.372 --> 59:12.614

59:12.649 --> 59:13.912
Look at this goddam shirt.

59:13.947 --> 59:15.617
I look like a African pill.

59:19.920 --> 59:20.786
- Kick his cheat ass.

59:24.694 --> 59:29.697
- I have, I learned that
having a dick means,

59:31.360 --> 59:34.361
if you try hard enough, you
can always go fuck yourself.

59:34.396 --> 59:35.263
Dominoes.

59:36.904 --> 59:39.707
Get the fuck out
of here Bernie Mac.

59:40.743 --> 59:41.841
- Man, wait a minute.

59:41.876 --> 59:42.842
Where did this even come from?

59:42.877 --> 59:44.107
Somebody check her.

59:45.847 --> 59:49.618
- Lets swing the
action onto table two.

59:49.653 --> 59:52.918
Look like big Slam is coming
for blood on them bones.

59:52.953 --> 59:55.855
- You remember that bitch
you wasted at the park blood?

59:55.890 --> 59:59.320
- Bitchuation? What the
hell is a bitchuation?

1:00:02.061 --> 1:00:03.698
Oh, you talking

1:00:03.733 --> 1:00:05.128
when you beat the
black off old dude

1:00:05.163 --> 1:00:06.261
for hitting you
with a basketball

1:00:06.296 --> 1:00:07.900

1:00:07.935 --> 1:00:10.199
Kinda, yeah. I know what

1:00:15.712 --> 1:00:16.810
- He taken a nap?

1:00:16.845 --> 1:00:18.207
- He had to be in the hospital.

1:00:18.242 --> 1:00:19.747
In the boma, blood.

1:00:19.782 --> 1:00:21.408

1:00:21.443 --> 1:00:23.344
I mean a boma?

1:00:25.117 --> 1:00:28.019
- Police are looking everywhere

1:00:28.054 --> 1:00:29.152

Do it look like I can bee

1:00:46.204 --> 1:00:47.335
- If I find out somebody's
snitching a bump

1:00:47.370 --> 1:00:48.710
on their gums about me.

1:00:50.846 --> 1:00:51.944
Well, I ain't got

1:00:53.112 --> 1:00:54.716
'Cause you got my back, right?

1:00:54.751 --> 1:00:55.816

1:00:55.851 --> 1:00:57.686
So I got partial of it.

1:00:57.721 --> 1:01:00.249

1:01:08.457 --> 1:01:10.292
You said you're gonna kill him?

1:01:10.327 --> 1:01:12.195
- Absolutely nigga, I

1:01:12.230 --> 1:01:13.460
- Did you hear that?

1:01:13.495 --> 1:01:14.934
My phone going off.

1:01:31.216 --> 1:01:32.820
That's mom's man.

1:01:32.855 --> 1:01:34.217
The doctor says she got

1:01:34.252 --> 1:01:35.856

1:01:35.891 --> 1:01:37.726

I'ma say a prayer

1:01:49.333 --> 1:01:51.773
- Big slam didn't even
have to lay one bone

1:01:51.808 --> 1:01:53.005
to win this round.

1:01:53.040 --> 1:01:54.435
His opponent took off

1:01:54.470 --> 1:01:56.272
like somebody told him
to split the check.

1:01:56.307 --> 1:01:57.845

1:02:04.513 --> 1:02:06.381

1:02:06.416 --> 1:02:10.187
Get some intels on

1:02:48.458 --> 1:02:49.930
- Something ain't right.

1:02:49.965 --> 1:02:51.327
- Okay?

1:02:51.362 --> 1:02:52.328
- Now Gerald with
that little white kid.

1:02:52.363 --> 1:02:53.461
- That wippy kid?

1:02:53.496 --> 1:02:54.803
- Yes, the little chunky one.

1:02:54.838 --> 1:02:55.496
The one who fails to do sit ups.

1:02:55.531 --> 1:02:56.365
- What's up?

1:02:56.400 --> 1:02:58.004
- That one.

1:02:58.039 --> 1:02:59.038
That motherfucker
is up to something.

1:02:59.073 --> 1:03:00.974
- What, what is it?

1:03:01.009 --> 1:03:02.877
- Ain't no way a white kid
hang out with a black man

1:03:02.912 --> 1:03:04.571
if they're not being kidnapping.

1:03:04.606 --> 1:03:05.946
Ain't no ransom involved
if you don't hang out

1:03:05.981 --> 1:03:07.409
with a little white kid.

1:03:07.444 --> 1:03:09.818
That's what I told ya
I'll to get to my fault.

1:03:09.853 --> 1:03:12.117
I'm going undercover and
tryna find out what's wrong.

1:03:12.152 --> 1:03:13.184
Did you get the mics?

1:03:13.219 --> 1:03:14.823
- We got it, we got it.

1:03:14.858 --> 1:03:15.285
- I got you, I got
it right here, look.

1:03:17.025 --> 1:03:17.991
- Bitch, do we look
like we're doing

1:03:18.026 --> 1:03:18.992
a motherfucking concert?

1:03:19.027 --> 1:03:20.389
What you gonna do?

1:03:20.424 --> 1:03:21.456
Well we put the
mic on, go with it.

1:03:23.064 --> 1:03:23.898
I'm a go around.

1:03:23.933 --> 1:03:25.262
And when I go...

1:03:28.465 --> 1:03:30.234
Bitch, have you ever
heard of

1:03:30.269 --> 1:03:31.169
- Yeah.

1:03:31.204 --> 1:03:32.566
- Me too, bitch.

1:03:32.601 --> 1:03:33.600
She don't catch a case.

1:03:35.274 --> 1:03:38.275
- So, our fish was
pretty great, right?

1:03:38.310 --> 1:03:40.442
- Yeah, sushi gives me gas.

1:03:40.477 --> 1:03:44.050
I'll regret it later,
as will your mother.

1:03:45.449 --> 1:03:47.251
Our marriage will
be tested tonight.

1:03:48.188 --> 1:03:51.288
- Papa, come on, please.

1:03:51.323 --> 1:03:52.454
Leaving without me now?

1:03:54.524 --> 1:03:56.359
- This has gone far
enough, Camilla.

1:03:56.394 --> 1:03:58.625
You need to stop now.

1:03:58.660 --> 1:04:00.264
You need to quit the tournament

1:04:00.299 --> 1:04:02.299
before you do even more
damage to this family.

1:04:02.334 --> 1:04:03.905
No, no.

1:04:03.940 --> 1:04:05.038
You're making a laughing
stock of all of us.

1:04:05.073 --> 1:04:06.468
- I'm not.
- Yes.

1:04:06.503 --> 1:04:08.503
- Look, I know we
have our difference.

1:04:08.538 --> 1:04:10.340
But how can you
treat me like this?

1:04:11.541 --> 1:04:12.914
I'm still your daughter.

1:04:54.287 --> 1:04:56.518
- You're working with
the area motherfuckers?

1:04:56.553 --> 1:04:58.124
- I just wanted a Fresco.

1:04:59.556 --> 1:05:00.423
- My fault homie.

1:05:02.229 --> 1:05:04.592
Old habits die hard you
know what I'm saying, blood?

1:05:04.627 --> 1:05:06.935
You can't run up on me
like that from the back.

1:05:06.970 --> 1:05:08.629
You know where I'm from
you get shanked homie.

1:05:08.664 --> 1:05:09.531
- Cool.

1:05:31.126 --> 1:05:32.389
- I like you, Gerald.

1:05:32.424 --> 1:05:34.358
I liked your
motherfucking old ass.

1:05:34.393 --> 1:05:36.063
And the way you
slapped them bones,

1:05:36.098 --> 1:05:37.526
you damn motherfucker.

1:05:37.561 --> 1:05:39.968
Dude you slapped the
fuck out them bones.

1:05:40.003 --> 1:05:41.167
- And the next batch
is gonna come to us.

1:05:41.202 --> 1:05:42.597
So why don't you
just go on ahead

1:05:42.632 --> 1:05:45.369
and drown yourself and
all that upcoming hand.

1:05:47.175 --> 1:05:48.339
- You know what, Gerald,

1:05:48.374 --> 1:05:49.670
let me tell you something, man.

1:05:49.705 --> 1:05:51.276
I like you.

1:05:51.311 --> 1:05:52.739
If a old motherfucker
did a lot for me,

1:05:52.774 --> 1:05:55.984
and you made a way for
a young fighter player

1:05:56.019 --> 1:05:58.052

myself to do what I do.

1:05:59.715 --> 1:06:02.650
I'm telling you something,
that little fat white boy,

1:06:02.685 --> 1:06:05.092
he's a little
chucky motherfucker

1:06:05.127 --> 1:06:08.590
you're running around with
playing up Mr. Rogers with.

1:06:10.165 --> 1:06:11.725
That motherfucker
is up to something.

1:06:11.760 --> 1:06:13.397
- And up to nothing.

1:06:13.432 --> 1:06:15.135
That's my son's new
stepson, all right?

1:06:15.170 --> 1:06:17.005
- Yeah.

1:06:17.040 --> 1:06:19.040
- Him and his mom have been
living this white privilege life

1:06:19.075 --> 1:06:20.635
living off their hard work.

1:06:22.177 --> 1:06:23.176
Fuck you doing?

1:06:23.211 --> 1:06:24.309
- I'm just checking man.

1:06:24.344 --> 1:06:25.772
Just say what you gotta say.

1:06:25.807 --> 1:06:28.478
- But he's a little fat
roly polis son of a gun.

1:06:30.152 --> 1:06:31.712
I got arrested of
their life, you know?

1:06:31.747 --> 1:06:33.351
But they just left them on me.

1:06:33.386 --> 1:06:35.023
I don't know what he does.

1:06:35.058 --> 1:06:36.222
I don't know where
he goes to school.

1:06:36.257 --> 1:06:37.652
I don't even know his last name.

1:06:37.687 --> 1:06:39.654
- You know. How the fuck
white people will come

1:06:39.689 --> 1:06:41.062
to hood just yelling.

1:06:41.097 --> 1:06:42.492
Six, four.

1:06:42.527 --> 1:06:43.625
Everybody know six
four on domino.

1:06:43.660 --> 1:06:44.791
That's some bullshit, Gerald.

1:06:44.826 --> 1:06:46.694
So goddam bullshit, Gerald.

1:06:46.729 --> 1:06:51.270
- So why don't you just
forget about this little

1:06:51.305 --> 1:06:53.107
Cheddar Bay biscuits eating boy

1:06:54.737 --> 1:06:57.408
and focus on the one who's
gonna fuck your life up

1:06:57.443 --> 1:07:00.411
better than a
NyQuil

1:07:00.446 --> 1:07:01.742
- I like that, Gerald.

1:07:01.777 --> 1:07:02.644
I like that.

1:07:02.679 --> 1:07:03.744
There you go.

1:07:06.188 --> 1:07:07.616
That's some bullshit like daddy.

1:07:07.651 --> 1:07:09.453
Take this guy down,
fuck that bullshit.

1:07:11.226 --> 1:07:12.093
- Sup Slams?

1:07:13.459 --> 1:07:15.459
You look like they
revoke you bro.

1:07:15.494 --> 1:07:17.758
Competition here is
tough as hell man.

1:07:17.793 --> 1:07:20.761
- And I need that,
my girl dumped me.

1:07:20.796 --> 1:07:22.136
- Well that sucks.

1:07:22.171 --> 1:07:23.500
What happened?

1:07:23.535 --> 1:07:25.073
What do you do?

1:07:25.108 --> 1:07:26.206
- I ain't do nothing.

1:07:26.241 --> 1:07:27.669
- Do you try talking to her?

1:07:27.704 --> 1:07:29.308
- I tried talking to her but

1:07:29.343 --> 1:07:30.771
she ain't trying
to hear that shit.

1:07:30.806 --> 1:07:32.575
Now she's scared of
me all of a sudden.

1:07:32.610 --> 1:07:34.247
- I feel you, man.

1:07:34.282 --> 1:07:36.381
How long have you
two been together?

1:07:38.286 --> 1:07:40.319
- About two and a half hours.

1:07:42.158 --> 1:07:44.422
I know it ain't a long time,
but it was real, you know?

1:07:53.433 --> 1:07:57.501
- If it isn't popping fresh,
you get your shit together?

1:07:57.536 --> 1:07:59.833
Oh, you gonna try to
fool me like you did,

1:07:59.868 --> 1:08:02.176

1:08:02.211 --> 1:08:03.837

1:08:10.285 --> 1:08:11.614

1:08:13.354 --> 1:08:15.321
Some say you're the
greatest ever did this shit.

1:08:18.161 --> 1:08:20.194
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

1:08:21.494 --> 1:08:22.823

1:08:22.858 --> 1:08:25.826

You don't believe me?

I don't know what he does.

I don't know where

1:08:48.587 --> 1:08:50.455
I don't even know his last name.

1:08:50.490 --> 1:08:52.391

1:09:13.513 --> 1:09:14.908
What's wrong with you?

1:09:14.943 --> 1:09:16.844
Game's about to

1:09:16.879 --> 1:09:18.483
Hey, where the
hell are you going?

1:09:18.518 --> 1:09:20.815
- Home, I'm ordering an Uber.

1:09:20.850 --> 1:09:21.948
Maybe look it up.

1:09:21.983 --> 1:09:23.620
- What?

1:09:23.655 --> 1:09:25.193
We're about to win the

1:09:28.594 --> 1:09:30.429

Big up to the

1:10:11.934 --> 1:10:13.637
You know what's
great about bankers?

1:10:13.672 --> 1:10:15.738
They always have money.

1:10:16.675 --> 1:10:18.004
Y'all watch busy bagels.

1:10:18.039 --> 1:10:19.841

- No, I'm good.

1:10:38.796 --> 1:10:40.961
- I'm not feeling too
well, it's my angina.

1:10:46.738 --> 1:10:47.968
- I'm gonna take a minute.

1:10:53.910 --> 1:10:55.448

1:10:55.483 --> 1:10:56.548
- Vibes.

1:10:56.583 --> 1:10:58.352
- Mm.

1:10:58.387 --> 1:10:59.485
Great.

1:10:59.520 --> 1:11:00.486

Andy?

1:11:10.531 --> 1:11:11.926

1:11:11.961 --> 1:11:13.697

1:11:13.732 --> 1:11:15.831

1:11:15.866 --> 1:11:17.734
'Cause this here is the big one.

1:11:17.769 --> 1:11:18.900
We've got Ines vs Ines,

1:11:21.905 --> 1:11:26.072
for control of the
familia

1:11:26.107 --> 1:11:27.711
and it's pretty
clear from over here

1:11:27.746 --> 1:11:29.548
where the fans loyalty lies.

1:11:29.583 --> 1:11:32.551
- Well, well what's
going on Luda Chris?

1:11:32.586 --> 1:11:34.652
You ready to go down

1:11:34.687 --> 1:11:37.083
I mean, I would
think you'd be used

1:11:40.660 --> 1:11:41.459
.

1:11:43.058 --> 1:11:44.926
I swear this isn't
even fun anymore.

1:11:44.961 --> 1:11:48.468
Hey, hey you promised me
a fight not a massacre.

1:11:51.506 --> 1:11:53.341
- Thea, she's got five.

1:11:53.376 --> 1:11:55.574
Is that seriously
the best you got?

1:11:55.609 --> 1:11:58.346
Oh sweetheart you're frazzled.

1:11:59.580 --> 1:12:00.810
What's that smell?

1:12:00.845 --> 1:12:02.713
Did you get your period?

1:12:02.748 --> 1:12:04.979
- Oh okay no, no, no it
must be your hair braided

1:12:05.014 --> 1:12:06.585
too tight.

1:12:06.620 --> 1:12:07.949
Either way I think
you worked out

1:12:07.984 --> 1:12:09.456
on me beating you
bloody

1:12:09.491 --> 1:12:10.820
Thank God for the red table.

1:12:12.626 --> 1:12:13.724
- This is starting to look
pretty bad for the one

1:12:13.759 --> 1:12:14.890
and only Dominica.

1:12:17.092 --> 1:12:18.927
- Oh, you're gonna cry, right?

1:12:18.962 --> 1:12:20.632
No don't do it right here.

1:12:20.667 --> 1:12:22.568
- Fuck this bullshit.

1:12:22.603 --> 1:12:24.735
If I'm going down, I'll be
sure to bite your dick off

1:12:24.770 --> 1:12:25.835
when I'm there.

1:12:30.072 --> 1:12:30.906
- Thea.

1:12:33.174 --> 1:12:34.547
But I'm your nephew.

1:12:38.718 --> 1:12:40.586
- Bro get your wife,
who are you smiling at?

1:12:41.688 --> 1:12:42.984
- Camilla

1:12:44.823 --> 1:12:47.120
- You boys may think dominoes
is machismo game huh!

1:12:47.155 --> 1:12:50.596
The thing you boys
forget about dominoes

1:12:50.631 --> 1:12:54.600
is that the bones might
be hard and loud and cold

1:12:54.635 --> 1:12:56.932
but the only thing anyone
actually gives a fuck

1:12:56.967 --> 1:12:59.506
about out of those
little periods

1:12:59.541 --> 1:13:03.103
laying enough together
on every side.

1:13:03.138 --> 1:13:05.171
motherfucker.

1:13:06.174 --> 1:13:07.008
- What the fuck?

1:13:07.043 --> 1:13:07.877
You gotta be...

1:13:07.912 --> 1:13:08.812
Come on, man.

1:13:10.618 --> 1:13:12.618
- Got the holy spirit here.

1:13:12.653 --> 1:13:16.787
Got the holy spirit, something
magical's happening here.

1:13:18.725 --> 1:13:22.188
- Fuck that, Camilla Ines
just dominated your ass.

1:13:24.731 --> 1:13:25.895
And the party don't stop

1:13:27.195 --> 1:13:29.063
as two of our
heaviest hitters go

1:13:38.943 --> 1:13:42.076
- I got that
activated

1:13:42.111 --> 1:13:44.518
- Man, come on man.

1:13:44.553 --> 1:13:45.651
- What about this?

1:13:45.686 --> 1:13:47.147
- No, you gotta go home, bro.

1:13:47.182 --> 1:13:48.621
- You've got to like that.

1:13:51.219 --> 1:13:54.726
- Tenspeed, what did
you do to that boy?

1:13:54.761 --> 1:13:56.662
- When the fuck you
start giving a fuck about

1:13:56.697 --> 1:13:59.225
a motherfucker you don't give
a fuck about motherfucker?

1:13:59.260 --> 1:14:00.699
- Who's a motherfucker?

1:14:00.734 --> 1:14:02.569
- You are a motherfucker.

1:14:02.604 --> 1:14:05.198
- Oh, so little squirty
you wanna fight dirty, huh?

1:14:05.233 --> 1:14:08.839
Why don't we just cut the
games and throw down clown?

1:14:08.874 --> 1:14:11.875
- 1974 style a box,
I don't give a fuck.

1:14:11.910 --> 1:14:13.008
Put them up.

1:14:13.043 --> 1:14:14.845
I'll knock your old ass out.

1:14:14.880 --> 1:14:16.616
- I'm about to knock the
wrinkles out of your grandma.

1:14:16.651 --> 1:14:19.487
- Swing bitch, that's right.

1:14:19.522 --> 1:14:21.115
Die right now motherfucker.

1:14:21.150 --> 1:14:23.788
You deserve it,
you deserve to die.

1:14:23.823 --> 1:14:24.921
- It's my heart.

1:14:24.956 --> 1:14:25.790
- Fuck your heart, nigga.

1:14:25.825 --> 1:14:27.693
- My Angina.

1:14:27.728 --> 1:14:29.893
- Fuck your aunt vagina and
the rest of them bitches.

1:14:29.928 --> 1:14:31.763
- You cool O.G?

1:14:31.798 --> 1:14:33.094
- It's like your grandmamma
is sitting on my chest.

1:14:33.129 --> 1:14:34.733
- Fuck your chest.

1:14:34.768 --> 1:14:36.163
Die, why are you
still standing up?

1:14:36.198 --> 1:14:37.802
- It's the big one Ella May.

1:14:37.837 --> 1:14:39.199
- God, why are you still
taking so goddam long

1:14:39.234 --> 1:14:41.102
the devil wouldn't
have been

1:14:41.137 --> 1:14:42.708
- I'm coming.

1:14:42.743 --> 1:14:43.577
- Don't you come over
here

1:14:43.612 --> 1:14:44.578
- Mr. Edges.

1:14:44.613 --> 1:14:45.975
- Fuck this nigga.

1:14:46.010 --> 1:14:47.515
- We should get you
to the hospital.

1:14:47.550 --> 1:14:48.912
- No, no, no, no.
- Fucker.

1:14:48.947 --> 1:14:49.913
- I just need to get
the blood pumping again.

1:14:49.948 --> 1:14:51.585
I ain't quitting.

1:14:51.620 --> 1:14:52.245
- Okay, let me get
you a chair, okay?

1:14:52.280 --> 1:14:53.246
- Let him die.

1:14:53.281 --> 1:14:54.280
- You okay?

1:14:59.694 --> 1:15:01.925
Well everything seems normal

1:15:01.960 --> 1:15:04.059
but you have to take it easy.

1:15:04.094 --> 1:15:06.567
No more fighting. Promise?

1:15:06.602 --> 1:15:07.260
- Promise.

1:15:12.608 --> 1:15:14.806
You promise to do
something for me?

1:15:14.841 --> 1:15:17.677
- But that is the
saddest I've ever seen.

1:15:17.712 --> 1:15:20.680
We're in front of white
people in bow ties.

1:15:20.715 --> 1:15:22.781
Can't take y'all niggas nowhere.

1:15:22.816 --> 1:15:24.717
- The footage is great.

1:15:24.752 --> 1:15:28.248
I mean, twists and turns,
drama around every corner.

1:15:29.823 --> 1:15:32.087
This is gonna be good,
real good, you know?

1:15:32.122 --> 1:15:34.188
But I'm a hustler.

1:15:34.223 --> 1:15:35.090
I get it done.

1:15:36.126 --> 1:15:37.664
What's up buddy?

1:15:37.699 --> 1:15:39.798
Though I'd pray for you.

1:15:39.833 --> 1:15:41.767
Come on man, come to
my office, you know.

1:15:41.802 --> 1:15:42.966
Prayer changes.

1:15:43.001 --> 1:15:44.836
- Okay.

1:15:44.871 --> 1:15:45.969
- And I realize, you know,
you're on my property,

1:15:46.004 --> 1:15:46.970
I haven't prayed for you.

1:15:47.005 --> 1:15:48.103
- Okay.

1:15:48.138 --> 1:15:49.038
- Put your hand on the Bible.

1:15:50.305 --> 1:15:54.879
Now look motherfucker,
it's 4:00 PM.

1:15:54.914 --> 1:15:56.782
The bank is closed.

1:15:56.817 --> 1:15:59.686
Now, somebody about to lose
some motherfucking fingers

1:15:59.721 --> 1:16:01.314
if I don't get my cash.

1:16:02.317 --> 1:16:03.756
- Okay, listen.

1:16:06.893 --> 1:16:08.959
I can't, I tried, I
don't have the money.

1:16:10.028 --> 1:16:11.797
Don't please, wait, wait, wait.

1:16:11.832 --> 1:16:13.766
I don't even have
the prize money yet.

1:16:15.099 --> 1:16:18.804
I'm hoping that this
film blows up, you know.

1:16:18.839 --> 1:16:20.773
That's why I invited
the investors down

1:16:20.808 --> 1:16:24.106
but I am 20 grand
in the hole myself.

1:16:24.141 --> 1:16:26.009
- Oh, for real?
- Yeah.

1:16:26.044 --> 1:16:27.648
- That's some shit.

1:16:27.683 --> 1:16:29.078
- I'm desperate,
I'll do anything,

1:16:29.113 --> 1:16:30.343
just give me a few
more hours, please.

1:16:32.787 --> 1:16:34.820
- So you want me to
give a few more hours?

1:16:36.791 --> 1:16:39.924
Well, you, my friend are in luck

1:16:41.730 --> 1:16:46.326
because the Lord has anointed
me to get my certification

1:16:47.263 --> 1:16:48.900
to be a same day lender.

1:16:48.935 --> 1:16:50.869
- Oh, that's convenient.

1:16:50.904 --> 1:16:53.234
- So you can sign right there

1:16:53.269 --> 1:16:57.139
and I can loan you money
for the next 45 minutes.

1:16:57.174 --> 1:16:58.041
- Okay.

1:17:01.409 --> 1:17:03.013
- Isn't it beautiful?
- Yeah.

1:17:04.786 --> 1:17:05.785
God is good.

1:17:07.921 --> 1:17:09.789
- Where's my money?

1:17:10.990 --> 1:17:13.793
- Oh, white Jesus.

1:17:13.828 --> 1:17:15.289
- That's your credit.

1:17:15.324 --> 1:17:16.763
That's right, that's the savior,

1:17:16.798 --> 1:17:18.292
He saved your ass today.

1:17:18.327 --> 1:17:19.194
- All right.

1:17:20.296 --> 1:17:21.295
It's gonna be good.

1:17:21.330 --> 1:17:23.099
It's gonna be real good.

1:17:33.177 --> 1:17:35.276
Look, wink, wink.

1:17:35.311 --> 1:17:37.212
I want to have your
big homies know

1:17:37.247 --> 1:17:40.314
that the first time you caught
a case at nine years old,

1:17:40.349 --> 1:17:42.987
you got caught stealing
some goddam twinkies.

1:17:43.022 --> 1:17:45.792
You was a motherfucking
twinky gangster.

1:17:46.960 --> 1:17:47.926
Nigga with the cream filling.

1:17:49.996 --> 1:17:52.293
Then give me 15 while you
sitting there thinking.

1:17:52.328 --> 1:17:54.064
- Who the fuck
told you that shit?

1:17:54.099 --> 1:17:55.428
- Your grandmother.

1:17:55.463 --> 1:17:57.265
She's a sweet lady.

1:17:57.300 --> 1:17:59.267
- Grandma always talking shit.

1:17:59.302 --> 1:18:01.137
Running her fucking mouth.

1:18:01.172 --> 1:18:02.468
Hating ass bitch.

1:18:02.503 --> 1:18:04.206
- Still in that halfway house?

1:18:07.475 --> 1:18:10.047
- So tell me, when
did you get out?

1:18:11.479 --> 1:18:14.084
- I spend 175 days in the hole.

1:18:14.119 --> 1:18:18.055
Nothing but darkness and the
sound of my own heartbeat,

1:18:18.090 --> 1:18:20.090
blood sweeping through
my veins, homie.

1:18:21.456 --> 1:18:23.027
Hey shit you can do
that can break me.

1:18:23.062 --> 1:18:24.424
I been through
everything, blood.

1:18:24.459 --> 1:18:26.833
- Give me that 20.

1:18:27.869 --> 1:18:30.001
You like that, huh?

1:18:30.036 --> 1:18:32.003
Congratulations on
your new relationship.

1:18:32.038 --> 1:18:33.774
- How the fuck you
know about Sherry?

1:18:33.809 --> 1:18:34.434
- Sherry?

1:18:34.469 --> 1:18:35.776
EBP?

1:18:35.811 --> 1:18:37.437
- What the fuck is EBP, blood?

1:18:37.472 --> 1:18:39.307
- Nigga, that's
everybody person.

1:18:40.981 --> 1:18:41.815
And don't even get mad.

1:18:41.850 --> 1:18:43.509
I fucked twice.

1:18:43.544 --> 1:18:44.884
The pussy barely decent, you
shouldn't be getting that mad.

1:18:44.919 --> 1:18:46.017
- Uh Oh!

1:18:46.052 --> 1:18:47.821
I can't hear what they're saying

1:18:47.856 --> 1:18:49.955
but it looks like Tenspeed
found his opening.

1:18:49.990 --> 1:18:51.418
- Fuck you, nigga.

1:18:51.453 --> 1:18:54.960
- Oh, you wanna fuck me now?

1:18:54.995 --> 1:18:57.523
Prison must have really
clean the best of you.

1:18:57.558 --> 1:19:00.361
Listen nigga, get
off your feelings.

1:19:00.396 --> 1:19:02.264
Calm down.

1:19:02.299 --> 1:19:04.167
Everybody's neighborhood
say good things about her.

1:19:04.202 --> 1:19:06.169
Here, see, hold on, look
at that pretty smile,

1:19:06.204 --> 1:19:07.775
ain't she gorgeous?

1:19:07.810 --> 1:19:09.139
- What the fuck is this?

1:19:09.174 --> 1:19:10.778
- That was her in
church with her grandma.

1:19:10.813 --> 1:19:11.911
- She sending you
pictures, nigga?

1:19:11.946 --> 1:19:12.912
- That was just at church.

1:19:12.947 --> 1:19:14.177
Ain't that smile pretty?

1:19:14.212 --> 1:19:15.541
Oh, this one you might like.

1:19:15.576 --> 1:19:17.851
Don't that smile look pretty?

1:19:17.886 --> 1:19:19.215
With my dick in her mouth?

1:19:19.250 --> 1:19:22.119
- Oh shit, slam is
about to lose it y'all.

1:19:22.154 --> 1:19:24.088
Everybody get down.

1:19:24.123 --> 1:19:25.859
This negro finna blow.

1:19:25.894 --> 1:19:27.960
- Everybody hit the deck.

1:20:00.258 --> 1:20:01.224
Hello?

1:20:01.259 --> 1:20:02.962
- Hey Andy, it's Namita.

1:20:04.625 --> 1:20:06.196
Yeah?

1:20:06.231 --> 1:20:07.967
- Hey, I don't know
where you are right now

1:20:08.002 --> 1:20:10.266
but can I talk to
you real quick?

1:20:10.301 --> 1:20:11.399
Yeah, sure.

1:20:11.434 --> 1:20:13.038
I'm outside on the steps.

1:20:13.073 --> 1:20:14.468
- Okay, cool, I'll
be right there.

1:20:17.473 --> 1:20:19.077
There you are.

1:20:19.112 --> 1:20:21.112
Everyone's worried about you.

1:20:21.147 --> 1:20:22.949
- I really doubt that.

1:20:22.984 --> 1:20:26.084
- Oh Andy, of course
they're worried about you.

1:20:26.119 --> 1:20:28.251
You've become quite
the talk around here.

1:20:30.255 --> 1:20:31.122
- Damn!

1:20:32.961 --> 1:20:34.961
A tragic loss for one of
the best to bang the bone.

1:20:34.996 --> 1:20:37.161
- Everybody get the fuck down.

1:20:42.300 --> 1:20:44.399
- Anybody wanna try some
shit I'll put your ass down

1:20:44.434 --> 1:20:45.532
just like him.

1:20:45.567 --> 1:20:47.204
- Damn, I need a better agent.

1:20:47.239 --> 1:20:48.876
- Oh, hell no cuz.
- Fuck this shit.

1:20:50.209 --> 1:20:52.110
- Hey, get your
big ass over there.

1:20:52.145 --> 1:20:53.012
Hurry up.

1:20:54.642 --> 1:20:57.148
Yeah, nigga, make a move and
I promise I started bursting.

1:20:57.183 --> 1:20:58.578
- Yeah, all right.

1:20:58.613 --> 1:21:00.283
- Put your hands in
the air fat wink wink.

1:21:00.318 --> 1:21:01.922
Do some.

1:21:01.957 --> 1:21:03.286
- Get your tiny
ass on the ground.

1:21:03.321 --> 1:21:04.518
- Please, I have several
adult rescue cats.

1:21:04.553 --> 1:21:05.651
- Hand cuff yourself.

1:21:05.686 --> 1:21:07.587
- Everybody is scared except me.

1:21:07.622 --> 1:21:08.588
I ain't scared of shit.

1:21:08.623 --> 1:21:09.589
- Hurry the fuck up.

1:21:09.624 --> 1:21:10.964
- Ah, I'm trying.

1:21:10.999 --> 1:21:12.361
- Yeah, that figures.

1:21:12.396 --> 1:21:14.528
Sad, lonely white kid
that nobody loves.

1:21:14.563 --> 1:21:16.200
I'm sure they're all laughing.

1:21:17.269 --> 1:21:19.533
- You know I'm different too.

1:21:19.568 --> 1:21:22.404
When I first came here, it
was hard for me to fit in.

1:21:22.439 --> 1:21:24.912
People judge me by my outside.

1:21:24.947 --> 1:21:29.048
But you know, you can't
judge a book by its cover.

1:21:29.083 --> 1:21:30.181
You just can't
always see through

1:21:30.216 --> 1:21:32.480
the rough exterior sometimes.

1:21:32.515 --> 1:21:35.351
- My parents don't
even care about me.

1:21:35.386 --> 1:21:37.353
They're too busy focusing
on their own lives

1:21:37.388 --> 1:21:39.289
and Cabo or whatever.

1:21:39.324 --> 1:21:42.358
- I'm sure that's
not true, not really.

1:21:42.393 --> 1:21:46.164
Like your granddad, they
may be distracted sometimes,

1:21:46.199 --> 1:21:48.903
but people tend to come
around when the dust settles.

1:21:51.732 --> 1:21:53.303
- You think so?

1:21:53.338 --> 1:21:56.405
- I do, family's
for life after all.

1:22:02.446 --> 1:22:03.610
- Move it here.

1:22:03.645 --> 1:22:05.282
Fill the fucking
bag

1:22:05.317 --> 1:22:06.580
Fuck you're looking at.

1:22:06.615 --> 1:22:08.186
Trick or treat mother fucker.

1:22:10.421 --> 1:22:13.488
- I think you might be the
first real friend I've ever had.

1:22:13.523 --> 1:22:17.261
- Well, I doubt that, but I
am definitely your friend now.

1:22:17.296 --> 1:22:20.330
So what do you say we
get back in there--

1:22:20.365 --> 1:22:22.970
- Namita, can I
ask you a question?

1:22:25.667 --> 1:22:27.073
Do you have a boyfriend?

1:22:27.108 --> 1:22:28.536
And what's reverse cow girl?

1:22:28.571 --> 1:22:32.309
Is it like a
time-traveling lady cowboy?

1:22:35.215 --> 1:22:37.050
- I'm going to time travel

1:22:37.085 --> 1:22:39.580
and pretend that last three
seconds never happened.

1:22:41.386 --> 1:22:43.584
Right now, we need to get
back to check on your grandad.

1:22:43.619 --> 1:22:47.390
He had an accident trying
to defend your honor

1:22:47.425 --> 1:22:48.721
against Tenspeed.

1:22:48.756 --> 1:22:49.689
- Where is he?

1:22:49.724 --> 1:22:51.328
Is he okay?

1:22:51.363 --> 1:22:52.593
Tenspeed better
not have hurt him.

1:22:52.628 --> 1:22:53.495
- Let's go.

1:22:57.567 --> 1:22:59.732
- Anybody else got
something to say?

1:22:59.767 --> 1:23:01.437
And who the fuck is you?

1:23:01.472 --> 1:23:03.736
Get the fuck in here.

1:23:03.771 --> 1:23:05.375
Huh?

1:23:05.410 --> 1:23:06.574
And get the fuck over there,

1:23:06.609 --> 1:23:08.180
you hear the fuck I'm saying?

1:23:12.285 --> 1:23:14.549
There's a fucking gun,
man, put that shit down.

1:23:19.655 --> 1:23:21.325
- Grab the fucking hook.

1:23:21.360 --> 1:23:23.393
- You're ruining everything.

1:23:23.428 --> 1:23:26.528
- Okay, yeah, pass the
bag around

1:23:36.111 --> 1:23:39.442
- My blood pressure is too much.

1:23:53.524 --> 1:23:54.622
- Motherfucker.

1:23:54.657 --> 1:23:55.623
- Bitch get the fuck off.

1:23:55.658 --> 1:23:56.492
- What's wrong with you?

1:23:56.527 --> 1:23:58.065
Tenspeed, bitch.

1:24:01.565 --> 1:24:03.136
- Oh hell yeah.

1:24:03.171 --> 1:24:04.071
- Where y'all going,
the motherfucker's dead?

1:24:05.404 --> 1:24:08.702
what's
wrong with you?

1:24:08.737 --> 1:24:10.209
- No, no, no, no, no, stay.

1:24:10.244 --> 1:24:12.145
Everybody stay in here.

1:24:12.180 --> 1:24:15.808
Not in my house, they're
not gonna stop my dreams.

1:24:17.647 --> 1:24:20.186
Look, what just happened
was a horrible experience.

1:24:20.221 --> 1:24:23.519
And I'm sure it's gonna
cost me thousands more

1:24:23.554 --> 1:24:25.785
in medication, therapy,

1:24:27.294 --> 1:24:29.129
which I absolutely do not have.

1:24:31.859 --> 1:24:35.366
But just stop for a second
and think about it, okay?

1:24:35.401 --> 1:24:38.303
Listen, some of you paid
a perfectly reasonable,

1:24:38.338 --> 1:24:41.141
but not minuscule price
to be in this tournament.

1:24:42.540 --> 1:24:44.738
And some of you spent
your hard-earned money

1:24:44.773 --> 1:24:48.676
to come out here and see the
world's best dominoes players

1:24:48.711 --> 1:24:50.117
go for the grand prize.

1:24:50.152 --> 1:24:53.450
$10,000, $10,000

1:24:53.485 --> 1:24:55.452
that has still not been claimed.

1:24:55.487 --> 1:24:56.651
I have it right here.

1:24:59.722 --> 1:25:04.197
Now, are you seriously
willing to walk away

1:25:04.232 --> 1:25:05.396
from what we've started?

1:25:07.202 --> 1:25:08.795
What we're part of?

1:25:08.830 --> 1:25:10.698
History.

1:25:10.733 --> 1:25:12.898
Just because a couple of
trick ass gangsters choose

1:25:12.933 --> 1:25:15.175
to disrupt our championship?

1:25:16.277 --> 1:25:18.178
Fuck those guys.

1:25:18.213 --> 1:25:19.872
Fuck those guys.

1:25:19.907 --> 1:25:22.314
Now, who are the
winners in this place?

1:25:22.349 --> 1:25:23.315
Huh?

1:25:23.350 --> 1:25:25.845
Is it us or is it them?

1:25:27.651 --> 1:25:31.554
'Cause I went on a search all
through South Los Angeles,

1:25:31.589 --> 1:25:35.723
terrifying journey to
find the best of the best.

1:25:38.200 --> 1:25:41.894
And those are the winners
that stand before you today.

1:25:43.271 --> 1:25:44.666
And for one of you,

1:25:44.701 --> 1:25:48.637
the title, the
respect, the glory

1:25:48.672 --> 1:25:50.804
is still yours for the taking.

1:25:52.973 --> 1:25:56.546
As long as you don't
let those losers win,

1:25:58.319 --> 1:26:00.616
we just keep fighting
for our dreams.

1:26:01.982 --> 1:26:03.751
Now, who's with me?

1:26:03.786 --> 1:26:05.192
I mean, come on.

1:26:06.756 --> 1:26:07.689
Yeah, yeah.

1:26:16.271 --> 1:26:18.370
It's party time, let's
get this started.

1:26:30.549 --> 1:26:31.383
LAPD.

1:26:31.418 --> 1:26:32.846
- Hello officer.

1:26:32.881 --> 1:26:34.815
There's just been
an armed robbery.

1:26:34.850 --> 1:26:35.948
All right.

1:26:35.983 --> 1:26:37.554
- How quickly can you be here?

1:26:37.589 --> 1:26:38.555
What's your location?

1:26:38.590 --> 1:26:40.227
- We're in Compton.

1:26:40.262 --> 1:26:41.921
Oh, I don't think

1:26:41.956 --> 1:26:43.626
we can make it out there.
- There's white people here.

1:26:43.661 --> 1:26:44.759
Oh, in that case,

1:26:44.794 --> 1:26:45.892
we'll be there in two minutes.

1:26:45.927 --> 1:26:47.564
- Okay, great, thank you.

1:26:47.599 --> 1:26:48.730
- Papa we should get
you to the hospital.

1:26:48.765 --> 1:26:50.270
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

1:26:50.305 --> 1:26:51.469
I'm fine.

1:26:52.703 --> 1:26:53.669
Are you okay?

1:26:57.345 --> 1:26:59.741
I don't know what
I would have done.

1:26:59.776 --> 1:27:00.874
If they'd hurt you.

1:27:00.909 --> 1:27:01.974
- I'm fine Papa.

1:27:04.385 --> 1:27:05.252
Listen.

1:27:06.783 --> 1:27:08.816
Dominoes was never
about pretending

1:27:08.851 --> 1:27:10.686
to be something I'm not.

1:27:13.658 --> 1:27:15.262
It's actually the only time

1:27:15.297 --> 1:27:17.561
I've been able to
be who I really am.

1:27:22.568 --> 1:27:27.571
But maybe this is a sign that
maybe this is not for me.

1:27:30.576 --> 1:27:31.872
- No, no, no, no,
no, no stop Camilla.

1:27:33.381 --> 1:27:34.248
Listen.

1:27:38.551 --> 1:27:39.748
I was wrong too.
- No.

1:27:47.395 --> 1:27:48.394
are strong.

1:27:50.024 --> 1:27:54.862
You have got more balls than
that punk cousin of yours.

1:28:05.941 --> 1:28:08.678
You can be whoever you wanna be.

1:28:13.080 --> 1:28:15.916
You're still my baby girl.

1:28:15.951 --> 1:28:18.655
- Papa, that's
all I ever wanted.

1:28:46.113 --> 1:28:49.048
- I gotta say, Walter, what
we've seen here today has been-

1:28:49.083 --> 1:28:50.049
- Real, right?

1:28:50.084 --> 1:28:51.688
Quite the experience.

1:28:51.723 --> 1:28:53.393
- Yeah a bit too
real for my blood,

1:28:53.428 --> 1:28:57.925
but, hey, thank you for
an unforgettable ride.

1:28:57.960 --> 1:28:59.828
- So unreal.

1:28:59.863 --> 1:29:02.028
- I guess suddenly will
start their work then.

1:29:03.438 --> 1:29:05.064
- What work, sir?

1:29:05.099 --> 1:29:07.968
- Well, you guys as
producers must know

1:29:08.003 --> 1:29:12.907
that the real in
reality television

1:29:12.942 --> 1:29:14.414
isn't really what it seems.

1:29:16.044 --> 1:29:17.978
That security guard you think
he's a real security guard?

1:29:20.719 --> 1:29:22.389
Actor!

1:29:22.424 --> 1:29:23.555
- What?

1:29:23.590 --> 1:29:24.116
- Oh, hell yeah.
- No, no way.

1:29:25.460 --> 1:29:26.756
- Genius.

1:29:26.791 --> 1:29:28.395
- No, no.

1:29:28.430 --> 1:29:30.122
- Those dudes that
came in, actors.

1:29:30.157 --> 1:29:33.796
Wardrobe, acting, all
of it guys, come on.

1:29:35.162 --> 1:29:36.931
Why are you gonna do
one cheap promo piece,

1:29:36.966 --> 1:29:41.969
when you can get hours
of ad sponsored footage

1:29:43.038 --> 1:29:44.741
for a reality television show?

1:29:44.776 --> 1:29:45.775
- I see it.

1:29:45.810 --> 1:29:46.908
- You see it?

1:29:46.943 --> 1:29:48.547
- I mean it's it's yeah, it's-

1:29:48.582 --> 1:29:49.614
- What about this
one right here?

1:29:49.649 --> 1:29:50.483
- Yeah, actor.
- No.

1:29:51.684 --> 1:29:53.585
- So real.
- Yeah?

1:29:53.620 --> 1:29:54.850
- You don't know man I almost
shit my pants I was crowning.

1:29:54.885 --> 1:29:56.522
- Oh yeah?
- Prairie dogging it.

1:29:56.557 --> 1:29:58.018
- Oh yeah, me too.
- Am so thankful.

1:29:58.053 --> 1:29:58.953
- Me too I was into it.

1:29:58.988 --> 1:30:00.526
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1:30:00.561 --> 1:30:01.824
- I mean that
speech you felt wow.

1:30:01.859 --> 1:30:02.825
- I felt it.
- Well, now I'm in it.

1:30:02.860 --> 1:30:03.859
Like now we are in.

1:30:03.894 --> 1:30:05.025
- You're in it?

1:30:05.060 --> 1:30:06.664
- We are in.
- Yeah, yeah.

1:30:06.699 --> 1:30:08.028
Do you guys want
some of the Forty?

1:30:08.063 --> 1:30:10.602
- Yeah, what is that?
- What is that?

1:30:14.168 --> 1:30:17.070
- Mr. Edges, I heard
you're sick, are you okay?

1:30:19.041 --> 1:30:21.481
- You just took down a
crazy ass bitch with a gun

1:30:21.516 --> 1:30:22.713
and you worried about me?

1:30:23.881 --> 1:30:25.980
Only white folks.

1:30:26.015 --> 1:30:29.852
- Well, yeah, I saw you
forgot this at home.

1:30:29.887 --> 1:30:31.821
So I grabbed them just in case.

1:30:31.856 --> 1:30:33.526
They are for your heart, right?

1:30:37.257 --> 1:30:38.124
- Yeah.

1:30:39.633 --> 1:30:41.732
But ain't nothing wrong
with my heart boy.

1:30:43.538 --> 1:30:45.164
This is nothing this little
pills can take care of.

1:30:47.135 --> 1:30:48.805
I ain't got it no more.

1:30:52.173 --> 1:30:53.579
I've been weak out there.

1:30:57.849 --> 1:30:59.585
I was faking just to buy time

1:30:59.620 --> 1:31:02.852
and now I realized that,

1:31:04.284 --> 1:31:06.460
ain't no more time
in this game for me.

1:31:08.695 --> 1:31:10.156
Time for some new blood.

1:31:12.798 --> 1:31:14.468
You're the one that got us here.

1:31:16.835 --> 1:31:18.505
You the man now Andy.

1:31:21.675 --> 1:31:23.807
I want you to go over
there, take my place.

1:31:26.108 --> 1:31:28.240
I want you to show
the world what we got.

1:31:29.276 --> 1:31:31.177
- Me against Tenspeed?

1:31:31.212 --> 1:31:33.652
- Against the world
starting with Tenspeed.

1:31:35.953 --> 1:31:38.690
- He's gonna roll over
and crush me though.

1:31:38.725 --> 1:31:40.560
- He ain't crushing you boy.

1:31:42.124 --> 1:31:44.025
You smarter than
all these people.

1:31:44.060 --> 1:31:46.962
You've proven it to me
now prove it to yourself.

1:31:47.866 --> 1:31:49.195
You're ready.

1:31:49.230 --> 1:31:50.834
All right?
- Okay.

1:31:50.869 --> 1:31:52.671
- Now I want you to
go on over there,

1:31:52.706 --> 1:31:56.543
when you sit down, I
want you to represent us.

1:32:00.615 --> 1:32:01.273
- Okay.

1:32:04.982 --> 1:32:07.818
- Him for me.

1:32:10.218 --> 1:32:12.218
- It's been a wild
night tonight guys,

1:32:12.253 --> 1:32:14.154
but let's get back into it.

1:32:14.189 --> 1:32:16.959
We have a last minute change
for our championship round.

1:32:16.994 --> 1:32:19.225
We got Gerald Pablo Bones,

1:32:19.260 --> 1:32:23.229
he's passing his seat seat
onto his grandson, Andy Edges.

1:32:23.264 --> 1:32:24.230
Get him youngster.

1:32:25.167 --> 1:32:26.034
Go on.

1:32:28.170 --> 1:32:29.301
- And this is it.

1:32:30.370 --> 1:32:32.172
Andy Edges is growing up fast

1:32:32.207 --> 1:32:35.142
as he sits in for
his ailing grandad.

1:32:35.177 --> 1:32:37.584
Is good versus evil.

1:32:38.851 --> 1:32:41.621
Purity and innocence,
versus a heart

1:32:41.656 --> 1:32:44.085
of the blackest midnight.

1:32:44.120 --> 1:32:46.758
- Hey, bitch, what you doing
that old racist shit for?

1:32:46.793 --> 1:32:48.661
Fuck you calling midnight bitch?

1:32:48.696 --> 1:32:50.256
- Hey fuck you Tenspeed.

1:32:50.291 --> 1:32:52.764
I hope a Lego falling
your skate boots,

1:32:52.799 --> 1:32:53.666
how about that?

1:32:54.834 --> 1:32:56.229
Now let's fucking domino.

1:32:58.266 --> 1:33:03.269
- Andy, Andy, Andy, Andy,
Andy, Andy, Andy, Andy.

1:33:09.915 --> 1:33:13.851
- What the fuck
adorable shit?

1:33:20.123 --> 1:33:21.925
- Let's go, shake em.

1:33:23.357 --> 1:33:25.896
niggas fully activated

1:33:25.931 --> 1:33:29.229
watch me activate it

1:33:29.264 --> 1:33:30.098
- Hit six.

1:33:30.133 --> 1:33:30.967
- Bam!

1:33:31.002 --> 1:33:31.834
15 like that.

1:33:33.334 --> 1:33:36.236
You know one thing
going on about dominoes?

1:33:36.271 --> 1:33:39.305
It ain't about no
goddamn app

1:33:39.340 --> 1:33:41.010
It's not about that shit.

1:33:42.277 --> 1:33:43.980
It's mental.

1:33:44.015 --> 1:33:45.619
This is all about psychology,

1:33:46.853 --> 1:33:49.381
and to win the mental game,

1:33:50.923 --> 1:33:52.692
you gotta know people Andy.

1:33:54.795 --> 1:33:57.092
You gotta know their strengths,

1:33:58.260 --> 1:34:00.161
you gotta know their weaknesses,

1:34:02.396 --> 1:34:03.395
but most of all,

1:34:05.806 --> 1:34:07.168
you gotta know what makes them

1:34:07.203 --> 1:34:11.304
buckle, under pressure.

1:34:13.143 --> 1:34:14.714
See, you don't know people.

1:34:15.849 --> 1:34:16.782
Just a loser.

1:34:18.082 --> 1:34:22.018
You just a little
chunky, obese little boy

1:34:23.824 --> 1:34:27.859
in Tenspeed house.

1:34:29.731 --> 1:34:30.389
Now,

1:34:32.899 --> 1:34:34.162
you're all alone.

1:34:36.001 --> 1:34:38.100
- Tenspeed officially revealing
he was raised by wolves,

1:34:38.135 --> 1:34:43.138
is going in on Andy,
damn, mind, body and soul.

1:34:44.944 --> 1:34:46.812
Can we please contact
child protective services

1:34:46.847 --> 1:34:48.715
on the line?

1:34:50.048 --> 1:34:50.915
- Give me 10.

1:34:52.919 --> 1:34:54.050
Like to count Andy?

1:34:55.856 --> 1:34:56.822
Give me 25.

1:34:58.089 --> 1:34:59.858
Think about everything
you're doing.

1:35:01.092 --> 1:35:01.959
Yeah.

1:35:03.523 --> 1:35:05.226
In the hood when you fuck up,

1:35:06.295 --> 1:35:08.361
some time you got to get out

1:35:10.035 --> 1:35:12.805
other times you gotta
go to the ball yard.

1:35:12.840 --> 1:35:17.843
- Oh Tenspeed with the blocks
as Andy keeps the digging.

1:35:19.242 --> 1:35:22.243
But goddamn, I know he
is a human skid mark,

1:35:22.278 --> 1:35:24.883
but the nigga can show domino.

1:35:24.918 --> 1:35:26.115
- Another one.

1:35:26.150 --> 1:35:28.084
Oh, try again

1:35:30.484 --> 1:35:31.351
and again.

1:35:32.893 --> 1:35:35.861
- Look Andy Edges,
digging his own grave.

1:35:35.896 --> 1:35:37.126
Don't follow the light Andy,

1:35:37.161 --> 1:35:38.325
don't follow the light.

1:35:38.360 --> 1:35:40.393
You better call on Jesus.

1:35:40.428 --> 1:35:42.230
Don't follow the light.

1:35:42.265 --> 1:35:43.099
- Shut the fuck up, can't
you see he is trying

1:35:43.134 --> 1:35:44.232
to concentrate?

1:35:44.267 --> 1:35:46.036
- Oh, ungrateful ass nigga.

1:35:48.975 --> 1:35:52.911
- You don't win at bones unless
you get in the folks head,

1:35:54.112 --> 1:35:56.079
the game is all mental.

1:35:59.282 --> 1:36:00.380
- That's 10 bitch.

1:36:01.416 --> 1:36:03.020
- Mr. Tenspeed Sir.

1:36:03.055 --> 1:36:05.022
- That's me there,
that's my grandson.

1:36:06.960 --> 1:36:10.258
- Wow, Andy Edges noting
the comeback is essential.

1:36:10.293 --> 1:36:11.391
- 15 Sir.

1:36:11.426 --> 1:36:13.525
- Looking not so little man, go.

1:36:13.560 --> 1:36:14.933
- You think we having fun?

1:36:14.968 --> 1:36:16.330
- Get in Andy.

1:36:16.365 --> 1:36:19.234
- Winning ain't fun
until it is won.

1:36:19.269 --> 1:36:21.269
Won is fun.

1:36:21.304 --> 1:36:23.403
- He's moments away
from taking it home.

1:36:24.978 --> 1:36:28.309
- That's 10 looks
like five to go.

1:36:29.917 --> 1:36:34.018
- Oh, looks like it's
all over for Tenspeed.

1:36:34.053 --> 1:36:35.382
There is a God.

1:36:36.451 --> 1:36:38.858
Is he heading for the boneyard?

1:36:38.893 --> 1:36:39.892
- Fucking brilliant.

1:36:44.932 --> 1:36:47.130
You only need five to go, jeez.

1:36:51.466 --> 1:36:53.807
But not that jeez, domino!

1:36:55.140 --> 1:36:58.240
Little mother fucker,
you can't beat me.

1:37:00.277 --> 1:37:03.542
Talking about the
mind, psychology.

1:37:07.086 --> 1:37:10.318
- Go on over there you goddamn
loser, that's the game.

1:37:19.032 --> 1:37:21.868
- Damn, what kind
of bullshit is that?

1:37:21.903 --> 1:37:26.565
- Well, I guess that means
Tenspeed wins, yippee.

1:37:26.600 --> 1:37:29.271
Now let me take my
ass and get a drink.

1:37:29.306 --> 1:37:31.174
- And the winner is Tenspeed.

1:37:47.390 --> 1:37:49.929
- Focus on the money,
let's focus on the money.

1:37:49.964 --> 1:37:51.359
- Oh, oh, oh.

1:37:51.394 --> 1:37:52.998
- Yeah, focus on the
honey lady there.

1:37:54.265 --> 1:37:55.165
And I wanna give a big shout out

1:37:57.499 --> 1:37:58.399
to drugs.

1:38:00.007 --> 1:38:02.106
Because they try to
make you think drugs

1:38:02.141 --> 1:38:03.668
ain't good for you,

1:38:03.703 --> 1:38:04.702
they're lying to you man.

1:38:06.706 --> 1:38:08.541
Some of the greatest ever
did, it was on drugs.

1:38:08.576 --> 1:38:11.280
I wanna thank Nino Brown
from New Jack city.

1:38:11.315 --> 1:38:13.447
I wanna thank Rollo
for a good time.

1:38:13.482 --> 1:38:18.485
Johnny Cash, 'cause like
he said, I did it my way.

1:38:20.357 --> 1:38:24.590
You are my first interracial
friendship and without you,

1:38:27.496 --> 1:38:29.067
I mean shit it still be the same

1:38:29.102 --> 1:38:31.333
but I'm really
emotional at this point.

1:38:32.732 --> 1:38:36.107
Only the world know
that I deserve this.

1:38:42.511 --> 1:38:46.150
- The American dream ladies
and gentlemen, you saw it here.

1:38:46.185 --> 1:38:48.548
The World Dominoes Championship.

1:38:51.157 --> 1:38:52.156
- Keep your head up.

1:38:53.258 --> 1:38:54.125
It's not you.

1:38:55.524 --> 1:38:58.492
Your grandfather ain't
shit, never been shit.

1:38:58.527 --> 1:39:01.066
I been kicking his
ass his whole life.

1:39:01.101 --> 1:39:02.463
And guess what?

1:39:02.498 --> 1:39:06.170
If I'm number one, that
make you number two.

1:39:06.205 --> 1:39:08.337
And guess I got
something for you.

1:39:09.736 --> 1:39:12.341
You keep that little
chunky

1:39:23.288 --> 1:39:24.155
- You done good.

1:39:26.027 --> 1:39:28.324
- I'm proud of you anyway.

1:39:28.359 --> 1:39:30.194
- But I didn't get your ring.

1:39:30.229 --> 1:39:32.130
- No, no, no.

1:39:32.165 --> 1:39:35.232
I'm proud of you because in
spite of all this trash talk

1:39:35.267 --> 1:39:37.399
you stood up to a bully

1:39:37.434 --> 1:39:40.600
and earned everyone's
respect, especially mine.

1:39:42.175 --> 1:39:43.471
You stood firm when
someone was trying

1:39:43.506 --> 1:39:44.703
to put fear in you.

1:39:46.476 --> 1:39:48.542
That's the very first thing
every black man learns

1:39:48.577 --> 1:39:49.642
in this society.

1:39:50.711 --> 1:39:54.251
So maybe you coming around,

1:39:55.716 --> 1:39:56.583
grandson.

1:39:59.258 --> 1:40:01.555
Look Andy, he can have it.

1:40:02.558 --> 1:40:03.425
I'm good.

1:40:05.462 --> 1:40:07.627
- Mr. Tenspeed wanted
me to have this.

1:40:07.662 --> 1:40:09.299
- What?

1:40:09.334 --> 1:40:10.729
Boy don't be taking
that from that guy?

1:40:10.764 --> 1:40:12.236
Could be anything.

1:40:15.637 --> 1:40:16.669
- What's in there?

1:40:27.187 --> 1:40:29.187
Is this Ella May's ring?

1:40:30.817 --> 1:40:34.786
- Yeah, I don't give a damn
about no ring no more son,

1:40:35.855 --> 1:40:36.722
I got you.

1:40:38.231 --> 1:40:39.131
- Thanks granddad.

1:40:43.863 --> 1:40:47.271
- Hey, I still got her
panties though nigga.

1:40:58.449 --> 1:40:59.712
- And where are you going?

1:41:02.189 --> 1:41:04.090
- You know what?

1:41:04.125 --> 1:41:06.851
You were clearly a pimp at
some point, am I correct?

1:41:06.886 --> 1:41:08.754
- But now I'm
pimping for the Lord

1:41:08.789 --> 1:41:12.626
and don't nobody take
the Lord's money.

1:41:12.661 --> 1:41:14.331
'Cause that's my money.

1:41:14.366 --> 1:41:15.860
You understand what I'm saying?

1:41:15.895 --> 1:41:18.467
Now where the fuck
is my money at?

1:41:18.502 --> 1:41:20.139
- Good news, good news.

1:41:20.174 --> 1:41:22.339
I got an advance on
the reality show and

1:41:23.573 --> 1:41:25.705
- Hey man, that's bad.
- Yeah

1:41:25.740 --> 1:41:27.278
That's bad, Sam.

1:41:27.313 --> 1:41:28.477
- Thank you, Lord.

1:41:28.512 --> 1:41:29.478
- Thank you, Jesus.

1:41:29.513 --> 1:41:30.809
Now about that inches.

1:41:30.844 --> 1:41:31.810
- Oh yeah.

1:41:31.845 --> 1:41:32.778
- Yeah.

1:41:32.813 --> 1:41:34.780
- White Jesus?

1:41:34.815 --> 1:41:36.650
- Oh white Jesus,
Holy Lord white Jesus.

1:41:36.685 --> 1:41:38.289
- All right, we're good now.

1:41:38.324 --> 1:41:40.423
- No, no, no, like the
paperwork you signed

1:41:40.458 --> 1:41:41.853
this is...

1:41:41.888 --> 1:41:44.196
- Interest.
- The collateral, white Jesus.

1:41:44.231 --> 1:41:47.430
- Okay, well what could the
interest be on a 45 minute?

1:41:47.465 --> 1:41:52.204
- Let's see, 45, 58%.

1:41:53.174 --> 1:41:53.799
- What?

1:41:53.834 --> 1:41:55.438
- See, see, see.

1:41:55.473 --> 1:41:57.473
You know what your
problem is, Walter?

1:41:57.508 --> 1:42:01.411
You shouldn't sign shit
under duress, right?

1:42:01.446 --> 1:42:02.544
- Ah shit.

1:42:02.579 --> 1:42:04.645
- Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit.

1:42:04.680 --> 1:42:07.351
Now I got to cut
the shit out of you?

1:42:07.386 --> 1:42:08.814
- No.

1:42:08.849 --> 1:42:10.156
- Yeah, I gotta cut
you, I gotta cut it.

1:42:10.191 --> 1:42:11.520
- You don't have to cut me.

1:42:11.555 --> 1:42:12.257
- I have to because
you know why?

1:42:12.292 --> 1:42:13.687
- Why?

1:42:13.722 --> 1:42:15.326
- People think I'm
old school, see?

1:42:15.361 --> 1:42:17.427
They think I preach
out the Old Testament.

1:42:17.462 --> 1:42:19.231
Old Testament preaching, dude.

1:42:19.266 --> 1:42:21.662
I'm more like a New Testament.

1:42:21.697 --> 1:42:24.698
Oh shit, I'm ordained,
I'm an ordained Minister.

1:42:26.405 --> 1:42:27.239
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

1:42:27.274 --> 1:42:28.372
I'm anointed.

1:42:28.407 --> 1:42:29.802
- How many fathers smite him?

1:42:29.837 --> 1:42:31.408
- I don't believe in the
effectiveness of your

1:42:31.443 --> 1:42:32.871
punishment blood.

1:42:32.906 --> 1:42:34.444
- Come on come on big
guy. Come on big guy.

1:42:34.479 --> 1:42:35.874
- Save me God.

1:42:35.909 --> 1:42:37.513
We've got enough
of that for today.

1:42:37.548 --> 1:42:38.844
- You get the fuck
out of here man.

1:42:38.879 --> 1:42:41.319
- That was really good.

1:42:41.354 --> 1:42:43.189
Proud of you fool.

1:42:43.224 --> 1:42:47.688
- Matthew 21:12 He who
lies can

1:42:47.723 --> 1:42:49.558
- You said it.

1:42:49.593 --> 1:42:50.460
- Don't say it.

1:42:51.826 --> 1:42:52.924
So what you like to
Netflix and bill too?

1:42:52.959 --> 1:42:56.202
- No, what if I'm matinee girl?

1:42:56.237 --> 1:42:59.238
- Matinee, I likes
that, that's old school.

1:42:59.273 --> 1:43:00.668
You my type of woman, Bamilla.

1:43:05.246 --> 1:43:06.542
All right, Camilla.

1:43:06.577 --> 1:43:07.444
- Yes.

1:43:11.582 --> 1:43:12.977
- You hungry, you
want something to eat?

1:43:13.012 --> 1:43:14.319
Let's get a fat burger?

1:43:16.290 --> 1:43:21.260
- Big Slams, I wanna make you
the head of the WDC security.

1:43:21.295 --> 1:43:22.294
What do you say?

1:43:23.297 --> 1:43:24.956
- The fuck?

1:43:24.991 --> 1:43:26.628
- Get the fuck out of my face
man, before I pack you out.

1:43:28.027 --> 1:43:29.730
- Okay.

1:43:29.765 --> 1:43:30.632
All right.

1:43:33.439 --> 1:43:34.570
We did it.

1:43:36.002 --> 1:43:37.870
And I survived with
all my fingers.

1:43:39.709 --> 1:43:41.280
You know what Namita,

1:43:41.315 --> 1:43:42.611
I could not have done
this without you.

1:43:43.977 --> 1:43:45.515
Why don't we make
this permanent?

1:43:46.848 --> 1:43:50.916
I'm gonna make you
vice president of WDC.

1:43:50.951 --> 1:43:52.258
- That's right.

1:43:52.293 --> 1:43:53.523
You're the new vice president.

1:43:53.558 --> 1:43:55.459
You know how real is that?

1:43:55.494 --> 1:43:57.329
- I don't know what to say.

1:43:57.364 --> 1:43:58.924
- Good.

1:43:58.959 --> 1:44:00.563
Because I got a lot of
thoughts going through my head

1:44:00.598 --> 1:44:01.564
and I don't want you
to stop the train.

1:44:01.599 --> 1:44:02.763
We're going worldwide.

1:44:02.798 --> 1:44:04.402
You hear me?

1:44:04.437 --> 1:44:08.802
London, Paris, Africa,
Afghanistan, Kazakhstan.

1:44:09.871 --> 1:44:11.541
Forget it, all the stans.

1:44:11.576 --> 1:44:14.544
And we're going
wherever you're from.

1:44:14.579 --> 1:44:15.677
- Cool.

1:44:15.712 --> 1:44:16.579
- You want some help there?

1:44:16.614 --> 1:44:17.712
- Yeah, thanks.

1:44:17.747 --> 1:44:20.385
- All right. It's gonna be good.

1:44:24.688 --> 1:44:26.424
It's a wrap y'all, it's a wrap.

1:44:28.395 --> 1:44:30.560
- That's it y'all. It's
a wrap, we're done.

1:44:30.595 --> 1:44:31.957
Y'all gonna get on out here.

1:44:31.992 --> 1:44:33.629
But guess what?

1:44:33.664 --> 1:44:34.025
I got one more tune
to take us all home.

1:44:35.094 --> 1:44:40.273
Young Bugatti, run it up.

1:44:55.455 --> 1:44:56.619
You lost, bitch.

1:45:00.757 --> 1:45:01.624

1:45:05.432 --> 1:45:06.530
- What's up y'all?

1:45:06.565 --> 1:45:08.928
This is my family y'all, no cap.

1:45:08.963 --> 1:45:11.337
We're back at it in
Compton, California

1:45:11.372 --> 1:45:14.571

1:45:14.606 --> 1:45:16.001
It's on.

1:45:16.036 --> 1:45:17.574
We got new jerseys
from the swap meet.

1:45:18.544 --> 1:45:20.445
This is my family y'all.

All the way from China

1:45:33.020 --> 1:45:35.823
We got some Rastafari
from the Bahamas

1:45:35.858 --> 1:45:37.759
coming with that sweet ganja.

1:45:39.125 --> 1:45:42.599

1:45:42.634 --> 1:45:44.502

1:45:49.641 --> 1:45:50.541
- We're out

1:45:50.576 --> 1:45:51.410

1:45:51.445 --> 1:45:53.808
- We're out

1:45:56.615 --> 1:45:58.714
- Fridah, are you really out?

1:45:59.783 --> 1:46:01.387
- Boy, you got a new look.

1:46:01.422 --> 1:46:04.753
- Yeah granddad, this
is my Compton swag.

1:46:04.788 --> 1:46:07.690
- Compton swag, get on here boy.

1:46:08.858 --> 1:46:09.725
- Let's ride.

1:46:32.145 --> 1:46:34.046
Beefing with that fool.

1:46:34.081 --> 1:46:36.521
- Think about this
look, what is that?

1:46:37.788 --> 1:46:40.690
In God's will is the holy jeans.

1:46:40.725 --> 1:46:42.120
You know I even draw characters.

1:46:42.155 --> 1:46:45.024
You so fugly, you see
this crack head one day,

1:46:47.127 --> 1:46:50.095
he had talent, I was like,
"Man , what you doing?"

1:46:50.130 --> 1:46:52.603
He was like "Man, I'm over
here making these balloons."

1:46:52.638 --> 1:46:54.737
And he was making these
sexy balloons and I said,

1:46:54.772 --> 1:46:57.971
"Why don't you come on down
here to the church work center

1:46:58.006 --> 1:46:59.577
and be an entrepreneur?"

1:46:59.612 --> 1:47:01.876
So now we've got
the erotic balloons.

1:47:01.911 --> 1:47:03.944
- Brownie is so fuck delicious,
you know what I'm saying,

1:47:03.979 --> 1:47:05.748
I thinking of starting
my own brownie business,

1:47:05.783 --> 1:47:07.816
you know what I'm
saying, with Joe Jackson.

1:47:07.851 --> 1:47:08.685
Joe Jackson.

1:47:08.720 --> 1:47:09.686
Oh yeah.

1:47:09.721 --> 1:47:10.819
Smack 'em brownies.

1:47:10.854 --> 1:47:12.018
You know what I'm talking about?

1:47:12.053 --> 1:47:13.591
Oh, yeah, that's
what we go'n do?

1:47:13.626 --> 1:47:14.724
Joe Jackson brownies.

1:47:14.759 --> 1:47:16.594
I can't even play dominoes

1:47:16.629 --> 1:47:19.465
but I don't really even
know exactly what happened.

1:47:19.500 --> 1:47:21.566
I got to put the
urge to run a 58.

1:47:21.601 --> 1:47:23.095
58 miles, man I thought
the tournament was over,

1:47:23.130 --> 1:47:24.569
which is crazy.

1:47:24.604 --> 1:47:25.636
'Cause I'm ready to go.

1:47:25.671 --> 1:47:26.571
I'm ready to rock.

1:47:27.937 --> 1:47:29.574
I've never lost
since I was three.

1:47:29.609 --> 1:47:31.477
So I just got a lot
of energy right now.

1:47:31.512 --> 1:47:32.907
That's the only one to
stand to stay apart.

1:47:32.942 --> 1:47:33.842
Anybody wanna build it.

1:47:33.877 --> 1:47:35.107
Build a house.

1:47:35.142 --> 1:47:36.614
So you didn't play?

1:47:36.649 --> 1:47:38.517
- Nah, I didn't get to play.

1:47:38.552 --> 1:47:41.146
Right now, I feel like if you
put dominoes in front of me,

1:47:41.181 --> 1:47:44.523
I could build an
origami out of dominoes.

1:47:44.558 --> 1:47:45.854
You ain't never seen
that shit like that.

1:47:45.889 --> 1:47:47.625
Thirsty on parts?

1:47:49.992 --> 1:47:52.696
- You don't just sit down and
just cordially play dominoes.

1:47:52.731 --> 1:47:53.664
What a motherfucker.

1:47:53.699 --> 1:47:54.962
Hey, nice hands.

1:47:54.997 --> 1:47:56.766
Great, shut the fuck up.

1:47:56.801 --> 1:47:58.735
Bitch, domino.

1:47:58.770 --> 1:48:00.165
20 motherfucker.

1:48:00.200 --> 1:48:02.805
Shut up, get in the
bone yard, nigga.

1:48:07.581 --> 1:48:09.042
- Domino motherfucker.

1:48:12.850 --> 1:48:13.717
- Walter.

1:48:14.819 --> 1:48:17.083
West side.

1:48:17.118 --> 1:48:18.150
This is my son.

1:48:19.219 --> 1:48:20.559
- I hate you.

1:48:20.594 --> 1:48:22.022
- It's all love down here

1:48:22.057 --> 1:48:25.058

Championship.

1:48:29.999 --> 1:48:31.603
- Where did everybody go?

1:48:31.638 --> 1:48:32.769
Hey, my cuffs.

1:48:33.937 --> 1:48:35.607

1:48:35.642 --> 1:48:37.037
Somebody help me.

1:48:38.073 --> 1:48:39.105

1:48:40.174 --> 1:48:42.009

1:48:42.044 --> 1:48:44.044
Y'all need to get a damn life

1:48:44.079 --> 1:48:45.848
