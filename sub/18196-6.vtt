WEBVTT

00:01.280 --> 00:04.158
I am not a number. I am a free man.

00:04.240 --> 00:05.275
You what?

00:05.360 --> 00:08.157
Well, Rachel's on her way to New York.
I can come and play.

00:08.240 --> 00:12.995
I'll pick you up in 20 minutes.
- That's the spirit, young man!

00:17.080 --> 00:18.798
Oh, hi, Pete.

00:18.880 --> 00:20.518
Yeah. Oh.

00:20.600 --> 00:22.511
I thought I might play golf this morning.

00:22.600 --> 00:26.195
David, you always get pissed off
when me and Adam do things without you.

00:26.280 --> 00:28.236
We were only saying this last night.

00:28.320 --> 00:30.117
What were you doing last night?

00:30.200 --> 00:32.191
We'll pick you up in 20, all right, mate?

00:39.360 --> 00:42.989
Come on, hurry up, David's waiting.
- I know, I know, I just can't find my wallet.

00:43.080 --> 00:44.513
Why aren't you going?

00:44.640 --> 00:46.278
With Rachel?
- Yeah.

00:46.360 --> 00:49.272
And listen to her and Jenny
talk about babies for ten days?

00:49.360 --> 00:52.716
No, I'd rather stay here with you,
take Rachel's advice, have some fun.

00:52.800 --> 00:54.631
Oh, while you still can.

00:54.720 --> 00:56.870
Oh! Let's go.

01:03.320 --> 01:06.437
A car auction?
I thought we were going to have some fun.

01:06.520 --> 01:09.432
Have a look around. See what's tasty.

01:09.520 --> 01:13.115
It's Karen's birthday in a couple of days.
I still need to get her a present.

01:13.200 --> 01:16.749
What are you thinking, driving lessons?
- I could get her something special.

01:16.840 --> 01:18.831
No, she already has a car.

01:18.920 --> 01:20.956
Not a Ferrari, she hasn't.

01:22.640 --> 01:24.995
Now, that is not a bad idea.

01:25.760 --> 01:27.159
Wheee!

01:28.880 --> 01:30.108
Oh, Karen.

01:30.200 --> 01:32.156
This is just like olden times, eh?

01:32.240 --> 01:33.673
You know?

01:33.760 --> 01:35.591
Now David's home.

01:35.680 --> 01:38.069
Well, there's certainly more washing.
- Yeah.

01:38.160 --> 01:40.390
But I don't know. It's nice.

01:40.480 --> 01:42.357
Maybe it's because I'm Catholic.

01:42.440 --> 01:46.274
But from the bottom of my heart,
I do believe in the sanctity of marriage.

01:46.360 --> 01:49.716
You don't have to be Catholic to believe that.
Just single.

01:49.800 --> 01:52.314
No, I do believe it.

01:54.160 --> 01:55.229
Hello?

01:56.080 --> 01:57.911
Mark. Hello.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.434
Not a subject I'd normally um...

02:05.360 --> 02:07.920
But Karen and I,
we actually had sex the other night.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.274
Ah! Ha, ha!

02:09.360 --> 02:11.555
It started as a massage.

02:11.640 --> 02:12.914
Was it good?

02:13.000 --> 02:15.150
Yes, my back had been...
- The sex.

02:15.240 --> 02:16.878
Oh, I see. Well...

02:16.960 --> 02:19.394
Um, how much detail do you want?

02:21.160 --> 02:22.752
Oh, my God.
- What?

02:22.840 --> 02:25.434
Well, Rachel's away, Pete's inactive.

02:25.520 --> 02:27.750
You're the only one who was having sex.

02:28.880 --> 02:30.791
Yes. The same thing had occurred to me, too.

02:32.000 --> 02:38.074

02:39.920 --> 02:45.153
Now, speed is not
a priority for the driver of this car.

02:45.240 --> 02:47.276
However, safety is.

02:47.360 --> 02:51.148
Four doors, allowing easy access.

02:51.240 --> 02:55.995
Plenty of boot space in the back
for those bulkier items.

02:56.080 --> 03:00.835
The question we ask is,
who would drive a car like this?

03:00.920 --> 03:02.353
Over to you, David.

03:02.440 --> 03:04.317
What?
- A boring old fart.

03:04.400 --> 03:07.039
What about a new parent?

03:07.120 --> 03:09.839
You'd get a travel cot in here.
- Something to think about.

03:09.920 --> 03:13.959
If you'll excuse me, this, however,
is more my kind of car.

03:14.040 --> 03:16.793
You know, Pete's right, Adam.
A Volvo makes sense.

03:18.600 --> 03:20.830
Sold to the gentleman in the check shirt.

03:20.920 --> 03:21.955
Ha, ha!

03:22.040 --> 03:25.271
Phwoar! Lovely! Whoo-hoo!

03:33.520 --> 03:35.636
Ho-ho, wow! Look at you!

03:36.520 --> 03:39.353
Well, that's what I'm hoping.
You know, people will.

03:39.440 --> 03:41.556
Well, women.

03:41.640 --> 03:44.438
What do you think?
- I think they will. Is it yours?

03:44.520 --> 03:46.556
Well, it's my little present to me.
- Mmm!

03:46.640 --> 03:49.632
Don't fancy a spin, do you?
- Yeah! Maybe when I get back.

03:49.720 --> 03:52.598
Why, where are you going?
I can always give you a lift, you know.

03:52.680 --> 03:54.636
For a run.
- Oh, right.

03:54.720 --> 03:57.553
You should come with me.
You've been slacking off a bit lately.

03:57.640 --> 04:00.916
Yeah, I know. Well, all right,
but don't work me too hard, OK?

04:01.000 --> 04:02.911
OK. We won't.
- We?

04:03.000 --> 04:04.797
You all right, Gifford?
- All right?

04:04.880 --> 04:06.757
You all set?

04:06.840 --> 04:09.070
Yeah, we're just waiting for Pete.
- Yeah.

04:09.160 --> 04:11.310
Yeah, we'll have to, if he comes running with us!

04:18.120 --> 04:21.555
Second thoughts, I tell you what, I won't bother.
Probably pull something.

04:21.640 --> 04:23.949
Are you sure?
- Yeah. You two, run along.

04:24.040 --> 04:26.190
All right. Come on.
- Bye.

04:34.560 --> 04:38.792
Oh, that's perfect, Ramona.
Thanks very much. I'd run out.

04:38.880 --> 04:40.836
I know. I use it. Sorry.

04:40.920 --> 04:42.433
Can I open this one?

04:42.520 --> 04:45.557
No, Josh, that's Mummy's present.
- No, David, let him open it.

04:48.960 --> 04:53.033
Oh!
- Oh, look, more bath oils. Isn't that lovely?

04:53.120 --> 04:54.838
No. It's massage oil.

04:54.920 --> 04:56.672
Mmm!

04:56.760 --> 04:58.990
This is from me.

04:59.080 --> 05:00.274
The present's inside.

05:06.800 --> 05:08.518
Sorry, I don't understand.

05:08.600 --> 05:11.319
What do you think it is?
- A picture of a horse.

05:11.400 --> 05:14.073
Yes, well, it is, obviously, but...hmm?

05:14.160 --> 05:18.119
OK. It's a painting of a horse,
and you're having it framed?

05:18.200 --> 05:20.077
No.
- Riding lessons?

05:20.160 --> 05:23.277
No.
- Pony-trekking in the Dolomites?

05:23.360 --> 05:24.634
No.

05:24.720 --> 05:25.948
It's...

05:26.680 --> 05:27.954
It's a racehorse!

05:28.040 --> 05:30.315
It's your very own racehorse.

05:30.400 --> 05:32.789
The idea came to me
when Pete was buying his car.

05:32.880 --> 05:34.916
<i>You want to get her a Ferrari?</i>

05:35.000 --> 05:36.069
No...

05:36.160 --> 05:37.479
A racehorse.

05:38.680 --> 05:40.511
Karen will be delighted.

05:41.360 --> 05:44.636
Yes?
- Yeah. Yeah.

05:44.720 --> 05:46.950
It's just...I don't really...

05:47.040 --> 05:49.235
I'm just a bit surprised.

05:49.320 --> 05:52.949
It's stabled at Chester racecourses.
It's running there. We could have a day out.

05:53.040 --> 05:54.359
Lovely.

05:55.560 --> 05:59.189
<i>He's practically moved in.
I wish I had hit him.</i>

05:59.280 --> 06:02.272
<i>Good thing you didn't.
Anyway, I thought you liked Suggs.</i>

06:05.200 --> 06:07.794
I do. I just don't like him going out with Jo.

06:07.880 --> 06:09.598
Can I drive the car home?
- No.

06:09.680 --> 06:11.113
Please.
- No. No.

06:11.200 --> 06:13.794
Oh, pretty please.
- No, it wouldn't be fair.

06:13.880 --> 06:16.872
Why?
- You'd only want one and you can't have one.

06:17.760 --> 06:20.991
Oh! Nappies on special offer.
Perhaps you'd better stock up.

06:24.920 --> 06:29.550
The prices! Good job we're not taking a holiday
this year, after all.

06:29.640 --> 06:31.835
Yeah, I don't go down the pub like I used to.

06:31.920 --> 06:35.515
<i>Hey, shall we get a video tonight?
- Oh, I'll be too tired.</i>

06:35.600 --> 06:38.068
Let's just stare at the wall,

06:38.160 --> 06:40.435
and talk endlessly about His Nibs.

06:40.520 --> 06:43.592
<i>Nibs...nibs...
- Oh, my God.</i>

06:43.680 --> 06:45.591
Pete! Pete, listen.
- What? What?

06:45.680 --> 06:46.749
Look...

06:46.840 --> 06:50.594
All this time Rachel's away,
I thought it was a chance to have fun.

06:50.680 --> 06:52.750
But it's my last chance to have fun.

06:52.840 --> 06:55.274
You know, I've got to make the most of it.

06:55.360 --> 06:57.396
Well, yeah, OK. How?

07:01.280 --> 07:05.068
Poker school.
- Yes, yes. Brilliant.

07:05.160 --> 07:06.957
<i>Two, please.
- Two.</i>

07:07.040 --> 07:08.598
Thank you.
- I'll have one.

07:08.680 --> 07:11.717
One plus Veron - no chance. Dealer takes...

07:12.960 --> 07:14.234
..two.

07:16.440 --> 07:17.714
OK, David?

07:17.800 --> 07:19.791
<i>I'll bet 40.</i>

07:19.880 --> 07:22.348
<i>OK. I'll see your 40.</i>

07:22.440 --> 07:24.556
I'll raise you 50.

07:24.640 --> 07:27.200
Which gives you 90, Pete.

07:29.720 --> 07:31.870
<i>Yeah, all right.</i>

07:34.440 --> 07:37.716
Why not?
- So, is it you who owns a racehorse?

07:37.800 --> 07:42.999
Yeah. Well, it's my wife, actually. It's running
at Chester next week. You should all come.

07:44.120 --> 07:47.112
Maybe you should get a box.
- No, the stable arranges transport.

07:49.680 --> 07:50.874
Hospitality.

07:50.960 --> 07:52.871
- Oh.
- That's what owners do,

07:52.960 --> 07:54.678
entertain their friends.

07:54.760 --> 07:56.671
That's a great idea.

07:56.760 --> 08:00.070
Yeah. Yeah, I could invite some clients,
get the company to pay.

08:00.160 --> 08:01.593
Great, lovely. Cheers.

08:01.680 --> 08:05.514
I think they'd be rather impressed,
rubbing shoulders with a racehorse owner.

08:05.600 --> 08:08.910
Well, you'd better get Karen
to stand next to them, then, hadn't you?

08:10.840 --> 08:15.152
Right. Well, I hope you haven't got
any plans for tonight.

08:15.240 --> 08:16.434
Yes. Sleep.

08:16.520 --> 08:18.078
No. No, sleep's for wimps.

08:19.200 --> 08:21.668
Right, you take Chapters 1 to 3,
and I'll take 4 to 6.

08:21.760 --> 08:22.988
What about the rest?

08:23.080 --> 08:25.469
Well, we'll do those later.

08:25.560 --> 08:29.599
Has anybody ever told you
that you are extremely irritating?

08:30.800 --> 08:34.395
Never mind.
When it's all done, I'll buy you lunch.

08:34.480 --> 08:37.870
Oh, yeah?
You reckon we'll be done by lunch time?

08:41.120 --> 08:43.236
Pete. Pete!
- What?

08:43.320 --> 08:45.629
Let's sandbag Suggsy.
- You what?

08:45.720 --> 08:48.632
When I've got a good hand I'll give you a nod.
We'll keep raising.

08:48.720 --> 08:52.315
If Suggsy wants to play, he has to stay with us.
Then boom! We clean him out.

08:52.400 --> 08:53.958
Oh, come on, that's not very nice.

08:54.040 --> 08:56.634
It's just a game.
- Yes, precisely.

08:56.720 --> 08:59.234
Well, Jo might be impressed if you beat him.

08:59.320 --> 09:03.233
Oh, I've given up on her. I'm looking elsewhere.
- Well, you did OK after Jenny left.

09:03.320 --> 09:07.836
You were riding left, right and centre.
- Yeah, but now I want a proper girlfriend.

09:07.920 --> 09:10.957
You know, someone to date.
The thing is, I don't know how to any more.

09:11.040 --> 09:12.678
How to what?
- Oh, nothing.

09:12.760 --> 09:14.751
Date women.
- Oi!

09:14.840 --> 09:17.513
Don't put yourself down.
You're always telling me.

09:17.600 --> 09:20.512
Oh, he can pull them, all right.
- Trouble is, I can't keep 'em.

09:20.600 --> 09:24.434
Simple. Buy them gifts, let them come first.
- Well, isn't Rachel the lucky lady?

09:24.520 --> 09:25.873
Yeah.

09:25.960 --> 09:29.236
I can give you some pointers if you want.
I mean, not that I know anything.

09:29.320 --> 09:31.629
Well, it looks like you're doing all right.

09:31.720 --> 09:34.314
Come on, I want your money!
Come on, get in there.

09:37.520 --> 09:39.511
You never told me it was your birthday.

09:39.600 --> 09:43.832
I used to have to remind people.
Now when they remember, I wish they'd forget.

09:45.120 --> 09:47.350
Oi! Are you going to do some work?

09:48.760 --> 09:50.671
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Sorry.

09:51.600 --> 09:54.353
Right then, where are we up to?

09:54.440 --> 09:57.079
OK, I'm up to the chapter
on balancing home and work

09:57.160 --> 09:59.549
and I need an example
of how one impinges on the other.

10:02.120 --> 10:04.475
Well, it sounds like you've just found one.

10:10.080 --> 10:12.196
I'll see you.
- I'm in.

10:12.280 --> 10:14.032
OK.
- I'm out.

10:14.120 --> 10:17.237
We used to play poker a lot. What happened?
- We had exams, didn't we?

10:17.320 --> 10:20.153
I got married, we had little Adam.
Then you got married.

10:20.240 --> 10:22.470
<i>Yeah, anyway, it's great. Um...OK.</i>

10:22.560 --> 10:24.835
Your five plus five.

10:24.920 --> 10:26.751
Folding?
- Folding.

10:26.840 --> 10:28.319
Come on, the Irish!

10:28.400 --> 10:30.550
And you always took it too bloody seriously.

10:30.640 --> 10:32.232
Spoken like a true loser.

10:33.080 --> 10:34.308
Full house.

10:34.400 --> 10:36.436
<i>No!</i>

10:38.640 --> 10:40.676
Come to Dada.

10:40.760 --> 10:43.035
How much it worth, that hand?
- 1 pound 26 pence.

10:43.120 --> 10:45.475
Oh, that's a big one.
- Woo-hoo!

10:45.560 --> 10:48.472
Woo-hoo!
- Come on, who's dealing now?

10:48.560 --> 10:52.553
You know, this is the one time
I really miss drinking.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.594
I used to have another bottle
just before I went to bed.

10:58.480 --> 11:00.436
Another...when I got up.

11:01.840 --> 11:04.308
You had it bad, didn't you?

11:06.880 --> 11:08.836
What, so you can have it good?

11:12.360 --> 11:14.669
Have you talked to your friends about it?

11:14.760 --> 11:16.079
No.

11:16.840 --> 11:18.751
It's difficult, isn't it?

11:18.840 --> 11:19.829
Yeah.

11:19.920 --> 11:23.390
David's really good about it.
We don't have alcohol in the house.

11:23.480 --> 11:26.950
It's different when we go out with friends.
They ask me what I want to drink.

11:27.040 --> 11:30.919
I feel like I've got this neon sign
flashing above my head. I hate it.

11:32.560 --> 11:35.677
At least they ask you.
I can't stand it when people come up to you

11:35.760 --> 11:38.991
and they order you a glass of water
like there aren't any other options.

11:39.080 --> 11:43.995
Or even worse, when they know, so they don't
offer you anything at all and you're parched.

11:46.920 --> 11:47.989
Yeah.

11:50.200 --> 11:52.509
Right, well, come on, then.

11:52.600 --> 11:56.559
We've still got the photos to sort out.
- Oh, no, no, no.

11:56.640 --> 11:58.870
Get up. Nearly there.

12:06.880 --> 12:10.634
Come on, Suggsy, what's it gonna be?
- Oi! Oi! No bullying.

12:10.720 --> 12:13.029
# You've gotta know when to hold 'em

12:13.120 --> 12:15.793
Too rich for me.
- # Know when to fold 'em

12:15.880 --> 12:18.314
Hey, what are you gonna do, raise or see?

12:18.400 --> 12:19.799
Hmm.

12:22.560 --> 12:25.870
I think I'll raise.
- Oh, come on, I can't afford that.

12:25.960 --> 12:27.075
Oh, dear.

12:27.160 --> 12:30.197
Tell you what, I'll let you off.
But if I win, I get to drive your car.

12:30.280 --> 12:31.713
No way.
- You can't see me.

12:31.800 --> 12:35.429
No. Someone lend me just a couple of quid.
Something. Just...

12:35.520 --> 12:37.829
Oi, oi! No borrowing.
- Well, no bullying.

12:37.920 --> 12:41.356
That's all there is. Pete.
- Right. Yes, thank you. There you go. That...

12:42.400 --> 12:44.436
Plus...

12:45.120 --> 12:48.510
The lot.
- Right. Fine.

12:48.600 --> 12:50.113
<i>There you go.</i>

12:50.200 --> 12:52.509
Read 'em and weep.

13:00.960 --> 13:02.678
Yeah!
- Yes, Gifford!

13:12.560 --> 13:15.836
Full house won't do it.
- But four sixes will.

13:17.320 --> 13:19.914
- Aww!
- I don't believe that amount of luck.

13:20.000 --> 13:24.312
Wipe-out! And once again,
Gifford loses all his money to Williams.

13:24.400 --> 13:27.119
But you don't get to drive my car.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.592
Right, I've had enough. Good night.

13:30.680 --> 13:32.193
<i>Me, too.</i>

13:32.280 --> 13:34.316
Yeah, cheers, Adam. Come on, Ramona.

13:34.400 --> 13:38.154
OK.
- Well, that was fun, eh? Let's do it again.

13:38.240 --> 13:41.038
<i>No, not me. I think we're busy.
- Yeah, this week we are.</i>

13:41.120 --> 13:44.237
Or go to a casino.
- Thanks. No, I'd better stay with Karen.

13:44.320 --> 13:47.676
Come on, where's your sense of fun?
- Listen, I'll go to a casino with you.

13:47.760 --> 13:49.318
Right, Ramona, you're on.
- OK.

13:49.400 --> 13:51.197
We can play with Pete's money.

13:51.280 --> 13:53.111
<i>Piss off!
- Ciao.</i>

14:00.120 --> 14:02.111
And this is mine.

14:02.200 --> 14:04.760
What's so funny?

14:04.840 --> 14:07.752
You can't use that. That is pornographic.

14:07.840 --> 14:10.513
<i>No, it's graphic.
It's to illustrate the joy of sex.</i>

14:10.600 --> 14:13.751
<i>Yeah, for women, not men.
- Men can read it as well.</i>

14:13.840 --> 14:15.558
<i>Do you fancy her?</i>

14:15.640 --> 14:18.234
<i>Er...she's all right, I suppose.</i>

14:18.320 --> 14:21.756
Bit young. How old are you?
- Excuse me.

14:21.840 --> 14:25.719
<i>A gentleman shouldn't ask,
a lady shouldn't tell.</i>

14:25.800 --> 14:29.713
Ah, but you see, I'm no gentleman.
- And I'm no lady.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.319
<i>Hello.</i>

14:34.400 --> 14:36.550
Sorry, I didn't hear you come in, darling.

14:36.640 --> 14:38.278
Hi, David, hi.

14:38.360 --> 14:40.078
Hello, Mark.

14:40.160 --> 14:44.233
We've almost finished. We have one more
picture to find. Do you think that's pornographic?

14:46.640 --> 14:50.030
Well, it certainly seems...unlikely.

14:51.280 --> 14:53.111
Er, sorry, David, you've...

14:53.200 --> 14:55.270
got it round the wrong way.

14:55.360 --> 14:56.315
Oh.

14:56.400 --> 14:57.753
Right.

15:03.480 --> 15:07.268
<i>And with one
furlong to go, it's Montezuma's Revenge.</i>

15:07.360 --> 15:09.669
But coming up on the outside, it's Lady Perfect.

15:09.760 --> 15:11.955
<i>Lady Perfect taking up the running.</i>

15:12.040 --> 15:14.508
She moves fluidly. You can see that.
- She's winning.

15:14.600 --> 15:17.990
David, it's not a race.
- And besides, your horse is third.

15:18.080 --> 15:19.479
Is she?

15:20.960 --> 15:23.793
<i>Ah. Well, they all look the same to me.</i>

15:24.840 --> 15:26.512
You know, from this range.

15:26.600 --> 15:30.479
So, you're keen on racing, are you?
- No, not really. I've never been.

15:31.840 --> 15:34.798
She's keen on horses. You said you wanted one
since you were little.

15:34.880 --> 15:36.393
Yeah, a pony.

15:36.480 --> 15:38.550
She's only two.

15:40.160 --> 15:42.116
Ah, she's catching up now.

15:42.200 --> 15:44.555
<i>No, she's running fifth.</i>

15:46.520 --> 15:47.748
<i>Hey?</i>

15:47.840 --> 15:50.195
It's a great-looking string, Harry.
- Thank you.

15:50.280 --> 15:51.793
Ah, here we are.

15:51.880 --> 15:53.393
Yes.

15:54.560 --> 15:57.836
Um, I've got a few clients coming to Chester.

15:57.920 --> 15:59.592
The firm's taking a box.

15:59.680 --> 16:02.558
So, um...what do you think of her chances?

16:02.640 --> 16:04.710
Oh, er, I'm not a betting man.

16:04.800 --> 16:06.631
Oh, right.

16:06.720 --> 16:08.597
Though, speaking of money...

16:08.680 --> 16:10.477
Your account.

16:10.560 --> 16:12.357
Yes. Yes, of course.

16:18.520 --> 16:19.839
Jolly good.

16:19.920 --> 16:21.512
How much?

16:21.600 --> 16:25.149
That is rather a lot, isn't it?
- Didn't you know that when you bought her?

16:25.240 --> 16:29.279
Harry did mention the figure which I thought
was per month. It turns out it's per week.

16:29.360 --> 16:30.998
200 pounds per week.

16:32.160 --> 16:35.277
That is 800 pounds per month. David, per year, that's...

16:35.360 --> 16:37.316
It doesn't bear thinking about.

16:39.200 --> 16:41.475
Maybe I can sell it.

16:41.560 --> 16:44.154
So, you're out for dinner. First date.

16:44.240 --> 16:45.912
Make conversation.

16:46.000 --> 16:46.989
OK.

16:53.480 --> 16:55.436
I like a girl that likes beer.

16:55.520 --> 16:57.112
Pete!

16:57.200 --> 16:59.760
I find it hard to do deep stuff, you know.

16:59.840 --> 17:05.233
OK. Don't panic. Films are always good.
Seems like chat, but reveals a lot about you.

17:05.319 --> 17:08.471
OK. Er...what's your favourite film?

17:08.560 --> 17:10.117
The Piano.

17:10.200 --> 17:11.997
You're joking?

17:12.079 --> 17:15.277
What a load of old bollocks that is.
Boring rubbish.

17:15.359 --> 17:17.794
It's a chick flick. You're not serious, are you?

17:17.880 --> 17:20.155
No. Crock of shit. But I'm in character.

17:20.240 --> 17:24.313
Well, don't be. Just be yourself.
Right, what's your favourite film?

17:24.400 --> 17:26.391
You wouldn't know it. Between The Lines.

17:26.480 --> 17:27.959
You're joking!

17:28.040 --> 17:31.476
Jeff Goldblum works for an underground
newspaper in Chicago.

17:31.560 --> 17:33.676
Boston.
- Oh...

17:34.720 --> 17:37.837
The answer to the question
whether rock and roll...

17:37.920 --> 17:41.833
...is not, like some people claim, hither...
- ...but thither.

17:42.920 --> 17:45.229
Wow!
- I can't believe it!

17:45.320 --> 17:49.552
Rachel, well, you know what a sore loser
Pete is, despite the practice.

17:50.360 --> 17:52.828
I won 24 pounds.

17:54.560 --> 17:58.439
Hey, excuse me, you're the one on holiday.
I get the presents.

17:58.520 --> 18:01.478
Anyway, I lost it all at the casino.

18:01.560 --> 18:02.754
Ha, ha!

18:02.840 --> 18:04.068
Hee, hee!

18:05.040 --> 18:06.268
Whoo!

18:07.120 --> 18:08.439
<i>Was it fun?</i>

18:08.520 --> 18:10.511
Well, she enjoyed it.

18:10.600 --> 18:12.033
I didn't.

18:12.120 --> 18:16.432
But don't worry, I will have fun
before you get back. Well, I'll have to.

18:17.960 --> 18:19.075
Nothing.

18:19.160 --> 18:21.037
No, no. I didn't mean anything. No.

18:22.200 --> 18:24.111
<i>Well...</i>

18:24.200 --> 18:26.634
I guess the only person I ever really loved
was Jenny.

18:26.720 --> 18:29.996
But hang on! I did have this massive thing
for Samantha Fox.

18:30.080 --> 18:31.513
Was she at school as well?

18:32.840 --> 18:36.515
What?
- Cultural differences. Cheers.

18:36.600 --> 18:37.828
Cheers.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.433
So, how about you?

18:41.520 --> 18:45.399
That's good. Act as if you're interested in them.
Women are suckers for that.

18:45.480 --> 18:47.436
No, no, no. I am interested.

18:47.520 --> 18:49.476
Oh, sorry. Not used to it.

18:49.560 --> 18:52.518
Um, what was the question?
- OK.

18:52.600 --> 18:55.353
How many times have you been in love before?

18:55.440 --> 18:57.317
Um, let me see.

18:58.160 --> 18:59.149
Once.

18:59.240 --> 19:01.549
And what happened?

19:01.640 --> 19:04.791
Oh, you know, the usual.
Scared of commitment.

19:04.880 --> 19:06.950
You or him?
- We were engaged.

19:07.040 --> 19:09.395
Hang on, I thought you said
that he was scared...

19:09.480 --> 19:12.153
Oh, he was.
He wouldn't set a date for the wedding.

19:12.240 --> 19:17.030
So I gave him an ultimatum and...
he gave me the elbow.

19:18.640 --> 19:20.596
It's funny how things happen.

19:20.680 --> 19:22.830
It seems kind of surreal now.

19:22.920 --> 19:25.388
That's why I came over to England,

19:25.480 --> 19:27.675
to get away from the lousy no-good bastard.

19:27.760 --> 19:29.159
And is it working?

19:30.720 --> 19:32.676
Well, Suggs is helping.

19:36.280 --> 19:37.952
Hey, good session.

19:39.680 --> 19:42.353
I reckon you are ready for a road test.
- Oh.

19:42.440 --> 19:44.670
I've got someone in mind, actually.

19:50.080 --> 19:52.036
Here we are, angel.

19:52.120 --> 19:54.076
Sit down, please.

19:54.160 --> 19:55.878
Other one.

19:55.960 --> 19:57.951
David, sell the horse.

19:58.040 --> 19:59.996
Ten grand a year is a lot of money.

20:00.080 --> 20:02.469
We could put Joshy through school for that.

20:03.320 --> 20:05.072
Not that we want to, of course.

20:05.160 --> 20:08.357
Anyway, it's your birthday present, darling.
I'm not going to sell it.

20:08.440 --> 20:11.750
Well, I will accept shopping vouchers
to the same value.

20:11.840 --> 20:14.798
I just wanted it to be something we could share,
you know.

20:14.880 --> 20:19.271
The joy of victory as Lady Perfect romps home
10 furlongs clear.

20:19.360 --> 20:21.920
You know this roulette?

20:22.000 --> 20:23.991
I don't understand it, you know.

20:24.080 --> 20:27.868
One night you win.
And then, the next night, I lose everything.

20:27.960 --> 20:30.235
You know with racing, David,

20:30.320 --> 20:33.756
with a good horse,
you could make a killing, huh?

20:33.840 --> 20:36.559
I mean, do you think that
this Lady Perfect is worth a bet?

20:37.680 --> 20:39.432
Not on your wages, no.

20:40.320 --> 20:44.279
If we have to pay the stabling for a few months,
we won't be able to afford a bet, either.

20:44.360 --> 20:48.558
I may have worked out a very clever way
to offset some of those expenses.

20:48.640 --> 20:49.868
Have a good day.

20:52.880 --> 20:56.589
Now, like us, a number of firms will be
having a box at the Chester races,

20:56.680 --> 20:59.478
but we have an opportunity
to stand out from the crowd

20:59.560 --> 21:01.710
in a way which will reinforce...

21:04.320 --> 21:06.959
...the recognition of our company name,

21:07.040 --> 21:08.712
a positive image

21:08.800 --> 21:10.552
and client loyalty.

21:11.360 --> 21:12.918
How?

21:13.960 --> 21:15.234
By having...

21:15.320 --> 21:17.959
our own horse called...

21:18.040 --> 21:20.315
DZQ International.

21:20.400 --> 21:23.597
Sporting the company colours,
running in the 4:45,

21:23.680 --> 21:27.593
and, hopefully,
joining us in the winners' enclosure.

21:30.720 --> 21:32.199
How much?

21:32.280 --> 21:35.829
Thank you.
Thank you all very much for your time.

21:37.960 --> 21:39.552
Oh, piss.

21:50.360 --> 21:53.272
So, tonight, I thought, greyhound racing.

21:53.360 --> 21:54.793
Er, can't go out tonight.

21:54.880 --> 21:56.199
Why not?
- Busy.

21:56.280 --> 21:57.793
What doing?
- Nothing.

21:58.840 --> 22:03.630
OK. It starts, I think, at 7:30.
- Look, I'm going out with Jo and Suggs.

22:05.440 --> 22:08.876
All right. Let me nip home and get changed.
- You can't come, Adam.

22:08.960 --> 22:10.598
Huh?

22:10.680 --> 22:12.033
Look, I've got a date.

22:12.120 --> 22:17.638
Right? Jo's working this shift at the gym
and there's this other aerobics instructor.

22:17.720 --> 22:20.393
She's set you up with an aerobics instructor?
- Yep.

22:20.480 --> 22:21.708
Well, let me come.
- No.

22:21.800 --> 22:24.553
Oh, just for a minute. I won't stay.
- No!

22:24.640 --> 22:26.835
Adam, I've got to get changed.

22:26.920 --> 22:27.875
Pete!

22:43.572 --> 22:45.194
Hi!

22:45.280 --> 22:46.599
Those idiots!

22:49.320 --> 22:51.709
They wouldn't even know
a good opportunity if it...

22:51.800 --> 22:54.758
you know, grabbed them by the mouth
and French-kissed them.

22:55.600 --> 22:57.875
Still, we might as well enjoy our day at Chester.

22:57.960 --> 23:00.952
If the damn horse does well,
I suppose we can always sell it.

23:01.040 --> 23:04.237
What's for dinner?
- You'll have to fend for yourself, darling.

23:04.320 --> 23:07.073
What?
- I'm meeting with Mark to put the book to bed.

23:07.160 --> 23:09.515
I thought you had.
- It just needs tucking in a bit.

23:09.600 --> 23:11.113
But I won't be late.

23:11.200 --> 23:12.713
Bye.
- Bye.

23:20.160 --> 23:22.230
<i>Oh, yes, I could get used to this!</i>

23:23.280 --> 23:25.840
I'll just save the world and...

23:25.920 --> 23:27.638
then we'll make love.

23:29.520 --> 23:34.036
Check yourself in the mirror.
All in all, looking surprisingly appropriate.

23:35.760 --> 23:37.034
Hello!

23:40.280 --> 23:42.350
<i>My God, is she flirting?</i>

23:56.320 --> 23:58.151
<i>Oh, my gosh. She is.</i>

23:58.240 --> 24:00.196
<i>She is!</i>

24:00.280 --> 24:03.556
<i>This is unbelievable!</i>

24:11.400 --> 24:12.674
Nice car.

24:12.760 --> 24:14.716
Yours, too.

24:14.800 --> 24:16.995
What are you saying?
- I'm Deborah.

24:17.080 --> 24:18.672
Max. Max?

24:18.760 --> 24:20.239
Nice to meet you, Max.

24:20.320 --> 24:23.551
<i>My name's Max. Holy God.</i>

24:28.480 --> 24:31.711
Hi, my name's Pete,
what's your favourite film?

24:31.800 --> 24:36.157
No. Hi, my name's Pete,
what's your favourite film?

24:42.520 --> 24:43.714
You're joking.

24:48.080 --> 24:50.548
<i>Well, are you sure
that's where you parked it?</i>

24:50.640 --> 24:52.710
Of course I am.
- It's easy to forget.

24:52.800 --> 24:57.271
I park it under a lamp so I can see it from my
window before I go to bed and say good night.

24:57.360 --> 24:59.351
You say good night to your car?
- Do I heck?

25:01.840 --> 25:04.354
All right, Gif?
- No, I'm not. Someone's nicked my car.

25:04.440 --> 25:07.079
Oh, bummer. You reported it to the police?

25:07.160 --> 25:09.720
Yeah, too bloody right I have.
- They'll be on the case.

25:09.800 --> 25:14.476
What else can you do?
Put it out of your mind, relax and enjoy yourself.

25:14.560 --> 25:16.437
<i>Hey.</i>

25:16.520 --> 25:20.559
Here's Liz now. Are you OK?
- What's her favourite film?

25:20.640 --> 25:23.598
I don't know. Ask her.
Just not straight away. All right?

25:23.680 --> 25:24.715
Hi.

25:25.760 --> 25:27.113
This is Pete.

25:32.120 --> 25:33.792
Well, we did it.

25:33.880 --> 25:35.359
You did extremely well.

25:35.440 --> 25:38.477
And better than that, of course,
you did it on time.

25:38.560 --> 25:40.152
Yeah.

25:40.240 --> 25:44.074
So, by a small way of thank you, Karen,
I bought you this.

25:44.160 --> 25:45.878
I thought I was getting paid.

25:45.960 --> 25:48.428
It's also a belated birthday present.
So, there you go.

25:53.040 --> 25:56.794
Mark, that is too...that's too much.

25:56.880 --> 26:00.839
Well, I thought it elegantly understated, myself.

26:00.920 --> 26:02.672
I can't take that.

26:02.760 --> 26:04.193
I don't understand. Why not?

26:04.280 --> 26:07.636
Well, you wouldn't give that
to one of your staff, would you?

26:07.720 --> 26:10.837
If it was their birthday, then probably...not.

26:10.920 --> 26:14.708
But you actually work much harder than them,
so there you are.

26:20.720 --> 26:23.154
That's not what this is about, though, is it?

26:26.760 --> 26:28.478
Karen, I like you.

26:29.360 --> 26:31.032
We've got an awful lot in common.

26:31.120 --> 26:34.078
And not just the old obvious.

26:34.160 --> 26:35.832
And that's it.

26:35.920 --> 26:37.956
What, that's it?

26:38.040 --> 26:41.430
No, no, that's not...that's not it.

26:42.880 --> 26:46.475
No, this is really by way
of an inducement, you see?

26:46.560 --> 26:48.198
I want you to work for me full-time.

26:49.240 --> 26:50.514
Please.

26:55.400 --> 26:59.234
This is a disaster.
- Well, if you forget about your car for a minute.

26:59.320 --> 27:00.912
It's not my fault. She brought it up.

27:01.000 --> 27:02.911
When?
- Her favourite film.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.991
Oh, yeah, Gone In 60 Seconds.

27:05.080 --> 27:07.640
It's shit.
- Pete, we're having a nice time.

27:07.720 --> 27:10.393
No, the film.
- Oh, yeah.

27:11.440 --> 27:15.558
Can you have a lasting relationship
with someone with completely different taste?

27:15.640 --> 27:17.676
Well, Suggs liked it.

27:17.760 --> 27:19.716
<i>Yeah, he did, didn't he?</i>

27:19.800 --> 27:22.360
I think I might just go home.
- Pete, don't do that.

27:22.440 --> 27:26.228
What are you going to do there except
stare out the window at where your car was?

27:26.320 --> 27:30.472
Yeah, you're right.
I probably wouldn't be able to sleep. Come on.

27:37.640 --> 27:39.312
Do you know...

27:39.400 --> 27:42.312
I have one of your birthday presents
in bed with me.

27:42.400 --> 27:44.391
I hope this isn't a Godfather moment.

27:46.080 --> 27:47.957
No, not the damned horse. No.

27:48.040 --> 27:50.554
The massage oil that Josh gave you.

27:50.640 --> 27:52.995
I'm not actually sure I approve

27:53.080 --> 27:56.038
of our six-year-old son
helping to spice up our sex life.

27:56.120 --> 27:58.554
I'm sure that Josh would like us to be happy.

28:10.920 --> 28:14.356
Excuse me, sir,
but whose birthday present was this?

28:14.440 --> 28:16.715
Oh, just a bit, then I'll do you.

28:37.520 --> 28:38.919
I should go.

28:40.480 --> 28:42.436
Pussy, sit down.

28:47.040 --> 28:48.439
Relax.

28:56.280 --> 28:57.872
Sorry.

28:57.960 --> 29:01.270
I seem to be out of soda.
- That's OK. I prefer it straight.

30:13.120 --> 30:14.189
See you.

30:17.200 --> 30:19.438
Do you know any other aerobics instructors?

30:20.200 --> 30:22.794
Well, there's Brian.
- Brian?

30:22.880 --> 30:24.074
Funny!

30:25.120 --> 30:28.510
My car. Look, look, look, that's my car! My car!

30:28.600 --> 30:30.636
Are you sure it's yours?
- Course I'm sure.

30:30.720 --> 30:32.676
How are you going to get in?

30:32.760 --> 30:34.239
With these.

30:34.320 --> 30:37.756
Are you going to steal it back?
- Course I'm not going to steal it. It's mine.

30:37.840 --> 30:39.239
You two, get in.

31:12.760 --> 31:14.034
Oh, shite.

31:15.040 --> 31:17.600
Shite, shite, shite, shite, shite.

31:19.680 --> 31:22.638
Police? I'm having a nightmare.

31:24.440 --> 31:26.032
Do you chew gum?
- No.

31:26.120 --> 31:27.917
Well, the thief does.

31:28.000 --> 31:31.515
Right, bag that for fingerprints. And DNA.

31:31.600 --> 31:34.592
Gifford, the police don't give a monkey's
about stolen cars.

31:36.120 --> 31:38.475
So they're stopping us
for you riding in the back?

31:41.240 --> 31:43.231
It's illegal to carry passengers in the back.

31:44.880 --> 31:46.279
<i>Sir, look at this.</i>

31:46.360 --> 31:48.237
<i>That's interesting.</i>

31:48.320 --> 31:49.992
Apparently, this car's been stolen.

31:50.080 --> 31:53.959
Yes, that's right, Officer. I reported it.
Peter Gifford.

31:54.040 --> 31:56.395
The name I've got here is Adam Williams.

31:59.880 --> 32:01.836
Let's go down to the station, shall we?

32:05.400 --> 32:07.595
Wanker!
- Come on. I would have told you.

32:07.680 --> 32:09.432
Bullshit!
- Well, I might have.

32:09.520 --> 32:13.559
Pete, I'm sorry, but if you'd lent it to me
in the first place, this wouldn't have happened.

32:13.640 --> 32:16.200
If you hadn't nicked it,
this wouldn't have happened.

32:16.280 --> 32:19.955
Will you tell him he's overreacting?
- You did get it back safe and sound.

32:20.040 --> 32:24.431
<i>Get out of it! Adam had no business stealing it.
- Stealing it! He only borrowed it.</i>

32:24.520 --> 32:27.398
Right, like you borrowed my Faithless CD?
- What?

32:27.480 --> 32:31.314
Look, there's no point you two falling out.
Right, we'll hear no more of this, OK?

32:31.400 --> 32:32.992
Good man.
- Do you need a lift?

32:33.080 --> 32:34.798
Yeah.
- Get the bus!

32:39.320 --> 32:41.470
Well, I must say,
I hadn't expected an answer so quickly.

32:42.800 --> 32:44.313
When do you want to start?

32:44.400 --> 32:46.755
I can't. I'm not taking the job.

32:48.240 --> 32:49.958
Is it the money?
- No.

32:51.120 --> 32:52.917
The hours?

32:53.000 --> 32:56.470
You know, we can come
to some form of an arrangement.

32:56.560 --> 32:58.118
No. It's not that.

32:59.320 --> 33:01.117
Is it me?

33:04.120 --> 33:06.156
It's just too much of a commitment.

33:06.240 --> 33:09.915
Right, you want an assistant.
That's easily managed.

33:10.000 --> 33:11.877
Gill, can you send...
- Mark!

33:13.040 --> 33:15.474
I just don't want the job. OK?

33:28.160 --> 33:30.390
Have you ever had a perfect moment?

33:31.200 --> 33:32.155
Hmm?

33:32.240 --> 33:35.038
You know, when everything seems just right.

33:36.120 --> 33:41.513
When there's nothing in the world that anybody
could do to make things better than they are.

33:43.080 --> 33:44.798
You mean, apart from during sex?

33:46.040 --> 33:47.678
I'm serious.
- So am I.

33:52.240 --> 33:54.196
I don't know. Um...

33:55.240 --> 33:58.118
Pete said he had one
when they were on holiday in France once.

34:01.960 --> 34:05.430
It was late in the afternoon.
You know, magic hour.

34:05.520 --> 34:08.830
We were on this camping holiday,
and it was terrible. It was awful.

34:08.920 --> 34:11.036
Everyone had bad colds. It was freezing.

34:11.120 --> 34:14.396
And then, I'm fast asleep and I hear pftttt!

34:14.480 --> 34:17.755
It's little Adam. He's had the squits.
And we've run out of nappies.

34:17.840 --> 34:23.039
There's no shops nearby. I come out of the tent
and this incredible dawn is breaking.

34:23.120 --> 34:24.348
Beautiful.

34:24.440 --> 34:27.989
And then I hear a little giggle
from inside the tent, which became laughter.

34:28.080 --> 34:29.592
And it was little Adam.

34:29.679 --> 34:32.592
And I'll never forget. It was just...

34:32.679 --> 34:34.398
a perfect moment.

34:36.199 --> 34:39.510
That's it?
- Yeah, that's it.

34:43.199 --> 34:45.235
I like getting pissed.

34:49.360 --> 34:50.713
What?

34:53.840 --> 34:55.795
We need to talk.

34:56.840 --> 34:59.434
<i>Let's move on now
to our fourth race,</i>

34:59.520 --> 35:01.033
<i>which is the Showcase Handicap.</i>

35:05.920 --> 35:08.878
Come on!
- Come on, come on, come on.

35:08.960 --> 35:10.996
<i>Come on, get up there!</i>

35:11.080 --> 35:13.230
Go! Go!
- Oh, yes.

35:15.400 --> 35:16.753
Oh, yes!

35:17.960 --> 35:19.439
<i>Come on!</i>

35:23.280 --> 35:26.317
This is going to be an expensive afternoon.
- Tell me about it.

35:26.400 --> 35:28.197
Which race is Karen's in?
- The last.

35:28.280 --> 35:31.113
Is that the race or where it'll finish?
- Yeah, good point.

35:31.200 --> 35:33.714
Let's get a beer.
- Something we don't have to pay for!

35:33.800 --> 35:36.314
Go on, you fool.
- Oh, shut up.

35:42.680 --> 35:45.353
Ah, darling, I think it's going pretty well.

35:45.440 --> 35:48.591
Charles, Lisa. So glad you could make it.
- Hello, David.

35:48.680 --> 35:51.638
Hello, look out for my horse
in the last race, Lady Perfect.

35:51.720 --> 35:53.039
Right.

35:53.120 --> 35:55.076
My horse.
- Well, you know...

35:55.160 --> 35:57.469
Joshy! Hello, darling.

35:57.560 --> 35:59.949
Ramona. Come and have a drink.
What do you fancy?

36:00.040 --> 36:01.268
In the next race?

36:01.360 --> 36:04.113
I think maybe Velvet Runner.
He likes firm ground,

36:04.200 --> 36:06.714
he's good over this distance
and is drawn on the inside.

36:06.800 --> 36:07.755
Um...

36:07.840 --> 36:09.990
You mean something to drink.

36:10.080 --> 36:11.832
Help yourself.
- Thank you.

36:11.920 --> 36:14.639
Andy, so glad you could make it after all.
Come on in.

36:14.720 --> 36:18.633
Darling, I think Lady Perfect is turning out
to be a rather inspired present.

36:28.040 --> 36:30.713
Nice-looking filly over there.

36:30.800 --> 36:33.872
Yeah. Carrying a few excess pounds, though.

36:33.960 --> 36:36.679
And knows we're talking about her.

36:36.760 --> 36:39.274
Hiya, Jo.
- Hi.

36:40.280 --> 36:41.315
Hi.

36:41.400 --> 36:42.879
Where's Suggsy?

36:42.960 --> 36:45.758
He's erm...he's not coming.

36:47.560 --> 36:49.198
Actually, we split up.

36:49.280 --> 36:50.793
Oh. Why?

36:50.880 --> 36:52.836
Well, it's no big deal.

37:06.280 --> 37:09.431
Thank you. Thanks very much.

37:13.200 --> 37:14.349
Hello.

37:15.160 --> 37:16.309
Hello.

37:16.400 --> 37:18.994
Oh, you look a little surprised to see me.

37:19.080 --> 37:23.039
No. Well, yeah, actually.
I didn't know you were coming.

37:24.520 --> 37:26.476
Your husband invited me.

37:27.520 --> 37:28.714
He didn't say.

37:29.840 --> 37:31.671
Geraldine not with you?

37:31.760 --> 37:32.954
No, no.

37:33.040 --> 37:36.191
Horse racing, er... Well, it's not really her bag.

37:38.880 --> 37:40.916
You're wearing the necklace I bought you.

37:41.680 --> 37:42.715
Yeah.

37:46.600 --> 37:49.797
Hello. Yeah, can we have 20 pounds

37:49.880 --> 37:52.553
on number three, that's Velvet Runner, to win.

37:52.640 --> 37:54.198
20 pounds, number three.
- Yeah.

37:54.280 --> 37:56.635
Ticket, Joshy. Thank you very much.

37:56.720 --> 37:59.280
OK. Come on, let's go get an ice cream.

38:00.400 --> 38:02.356
So why did you split up, then?

38:02.440 --> 38:06.274
Oh, you know, I just figured we didn't
actually have that much in common.

38:06.360 --> 38:09.079
So what made you decide that?

38:12.960 --> 38:15.235
So, have you got your eye on anything?

38:18.840 --> 38:21.115
Oh, I don't know, the favourite.

38:24.240 --> 38:26.470
So you're up next?
- Yeah.

38:27.520 --> 38:30.432
Hey, listen, Mark,
I think it would be better if you left.

38:32.720 --> 38:34.995
Why? Is it something I said?
- No.

38:35.080 --> 38:36.832
It's just I think it would be better.

38:36.920 --> 38:38.478
No, no, no.

38:38.560 --> 38:42.155
I didn't come here for the racing,
I didn't come here to network.

38:42.240 --> 38:44.196
I came here to see you.
- I know.

38:46.360 --> 38:48.430
Karen, I think I'm falling in love with you.

38:49.520 --> 38:52.478
Karen! Karen, darling, it's time to go.

38:52.560 --> 38:54.710
Hello, having a good time?
- Yeah, very much.

38:54.800 --> 38:56.153
Come on.

38:58.360 --> 39:00.635
<i>Right, down to the parade ring, everyone.</i>

39:01.800 --> 39:03.756
Ah, this is the life, Karen.

39:09.800 --> 39:13.190
It's only a race, Ramona.
- Yeah, for you, maybe.

39:13.280 --> 39:14.838
There he is.

39:16.760 --> 39:20.196
Have you put your money on yet?
- No, but I think we should go soon.

39:20.280 --> 39:24.034
The going should suit her.
- Good, good. Right, let's have a look at her.

39:24.120 --> 39:26.350
I'm so sorry! Are you all right?

39:26.440 --> 39:28.908
I do beg your pardon. So sorry.

39:29.920 --> 39:32.195
God, I hope that wasn't ours.
- The favourite.

39:32.280 --> 39:33.952
Not any more.

39:34.040 --> 39:35.758
Ah, here she is!

39:35.840 --> 39:38.912
I bet David's loving all this.
- Oh, yeah!

39:39.920 --> 39:42.229
Look, we're going to go and put our bets on.

39:42.320 --> 39:45.153
Yeah, put a tenner on for me.
- Are you not coming?

39:45.240 --> 39:47.390
No, no, I think I'll stay here.

39:47.480 --> 39:49.072
Oh, right.

39:50.720 --> 39:53.393
Come on, Joshy. Hup. Hoodlah-hi-ho.

40:02.520 --> 40:04.078
Good luck.

40:07.400 --> 40:10.392
You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine. Sorry, just a bit nervous.

40:10.480 --> 40:13.438
Me too. Come on,
let's go and watch it with the others.

40:21.520 --> 40:23.192
<i>Here we go. Here we go.</i>

40:23.280 --> 40:25.157
<i>Come on, come on, Lady Perfect.</i>

40:33.400 --> 40:34.799
<i>Come on!</i>

40:42.840 --> 40:44.796
Yes! We're going to win it!

40:47.800 --> 40:49.995
No, no, no...

40:52.560 --> 40:53.675
No!

40:53.760 --> 40:55.352
Oh, my God!

40:56.280 --> 40:59.078
Bad luck, bad luck, bad luck.
- Never mind.

40:59.160 --> 41:01.037
Don't worry, darling.

41:01.120 --> 41:02.758
Are you all right, Ramona?

41:02.840 --> 41:05.957
<i>Just another two furlongs,
she'd have got there.</i>

41:07.680 --> 41:10.353
Ramona. Ramona, are you all right?

41:10.440 --> 41:12.874
No, it is not all right, David. I needed to win.

41:12.960 --> 41:14.837
Needed? How much have you lost?

41:14.920 --> 41:17.593
I don't know, 500 or 600 pounds.
- You bet that much?

41:17.680 --> 41:20.638
No, not just betting. Roulette, cards, everything.

41:20.720 --> 41:23.678
Look, Adam took me to a casino, OK?

41:24.960 --> 41:26.632
I got buggered by the beat.
- Sorry?

41:26.720 --> 41:29.678
B-B-Beaten by the bug?

41:29.760 --> 41:31.478
Oh, right.

41:31.560 --> 41:33.915
Anyway, I need to win it back. It's all my savings.

41:34.000 --> 41:35.592
Ramona, that's terrible.

41:35.680 --> 41:37.989
I know. But it's not Adam's fault, OK?

41:38.080 --> 41:40.116
Indeed, it's yours, but...

41:40.200 --> 41:44.352
Look, Ramona, if you can promise me faithfully
that you will never gamble again...

41:45.880 --> 41:47.632
..I will make good your losses.

41:47.720 --> 41:48.835
Make good?

41:48.920 --> 41:52.230
The money, yes.
- Oh. Oh, David, that's wonderful.

41:52.320 --> 41:55.232
Thank you so much.
- Not at all. Not at all.

41:55.320 --> 41:57.276
You can pay me back 10 pounds a week.

41:58.360 --> 41:59.315
Oh.

42:00.280 --> 42:02.794
Harry.
- Mr Marsden, could I have a word?

42:03.960 --> 42:05.678
Where's Jo?
- Gone for a pee.

42:05.760 --> 42:07.159
Ooh-ooh!

42:07.240 --> 42:09.595
What's the matter with you?
- Nothing.

42:09.680 --> 42:11.079
Eh?
- Max?

42:12.240 --> 42:14.629
Max, I should have known you'd be into racing.

42:14.720 --> 42:17.154
I don't think I...
- His name's Adam.

42:17.240 --> 42:19.629
Adam?
- Mmm.

42:19.720 --> 42:21.915
I guess I must be thinking of someone else.

42:22.000 --> 42:23.228
Yeah, probably.

42:23.320 --> 42:26.357
It wasn't you who came back to my flat
the other night?

42:26.440 --> 42:27.668
No!

42:27.760 --> 42:30.877
Took me to bed and couldn't deliver the goods?

42:30.960 --> 42:32.188
No.

42:32.280 --> 42:34.396
Drives a red MGB?

42:35.760 --> 42:37.512
Fine.

42:39.440 --> 42:42.955
I did not sleep with her.
- You were pissed! Couldn't deliver the goods.

42:43.040 --> 42:46.715
I wasn't drunk. I was driving.
Your car - that's what got me into trouble.

42:46.800 --> 42:50.349
Oh, so it's my fault now, is it?
- No, no.

42:51.880 --> 42:54.440
I was just trying to have a bit of fun.

42:54.520 --> 42:56.750
By shagging some bird.
- No.

42:56.840 --> 42:58.717
Well...

42:58.800 --> 43:00.279
Oh, here we go.

43:00.360 --> 43:02.316
I'm going to be a father soon.

43:03.320 --> 43:06.551
This was my last chance.
No-one need ever know.

43:08.920 --> 43:10.876
It's not like I'd see her again.

43:10.960 --> 43:12.188
Ha! Good thinking.

43:13.840 --> 43:15.273
So, what actually did happen?

43:24.160 --> 43:27.630
Shall we leave the lights on?
- Er...no. No.

43:27.720 --> 43:30.757
All right, I'll turn them off, then.
- No, no, I mean...

43:32.440 --> 43:35.398
I can't do this.
- Why not?

43:39.120 --> 43:40.109
Er...

43:41.000 --> 43:42.149
I...

43:42.240 --> 43:44.037
Oh...

43:46.480 --> 43:48.198
<i>I could've, you know.</i>

43:49.840 --> 43:51.398
A big bit of me wanted to.

43:51.480 --> 43:53.118
But I didn't.

43:54.840 --> 43:57.354
Because I love Rachel. Pure and simple.

44:00.840 --> 44:04.116
I suppose I'm more of a Volvo driver
than I thought.

44:07.760 --> 44:10.035
Who'd ever have thought that you'd grow up?

44:24.040 --> 44:25.359
Excuse me.

44:25.440 --> 44:27.271
Champagne or orange, madam?

44:28.160 --> 44:30.116
Champagne, please. Thanks.

44:33.040 --> 44:34.393
Karen, don't.

44:40.000 --> 44:41.797
Just don't.

45:01.640 --> 45:03.949
Not here, not here, not here.
- Then where?

45:04.040 --> 45:06.713
Karen, there you are.
I've been looking for you everywhere.

45:08.400 --> 45:10.550
Excuse me, Mark, sorry,
could we have a moment?

45:10.640 --> 45:11.755
Er...no.

45:11.840 --> 45:13.831
Yeah, I'm sorry. Of course.

45:15.600 --> 45:17.830
Karen, I've got some rather bad news.

45:17.920 --> 45:20.593
Lady Perfect has gone lame.

45:21.440 --> 45:23.396
Now, she won't have to be put down.

45:23.480 --> 45:26.040
Although that, of course,
would be the cheapest option.

45:26.120 --> 45:28.315
No, no, we'll keep her.

45:28.400 --> 45:30.038
In a field.

45:30.960 --> 45:31.995
OK?

45:32.080 --> 45:34.071
It'll be cheaper than a racing stables.

45:35.560 --> 45:37.755
Look, I know it's upsetting, darling.

45:38.560 --> 45:41.632
I'm sorry. This isn't quite the day
we'd been hoping for, is it?

45:41.720 --> 45:42.709
No.

45:44.160 --> 45:46.958
I wish Adam'd hurry up.
- Yeah.

45:52.360 --> 45:53.509
Pete?
- Yeah.

45:53.600 --> 45:55.909
Do you think you could give me a lift home?

45:56.000 --> 45:58.594
I'm sorry. I promised Adam a lift.
I can only take...

45:58.680 --> 45:59.874
..one passenger.

45:59.960 --> 46:02.155
Sorry.
- No worries, no worries.

46:02.240 --> 46:03.355
OK.

46:09.280 --> 46:10.872
Look, um...
- Yeah?

46:10.960 --> 46:12.518
Do you want to go to a movie tonight?

46:12.600 --> 46:15.273
What are we doing? Practising for my next date?

46:17.680 --> 46:21.275
Actually, I was thinking
it could be your next date.

46:21.360 --> 46:22.873
OK.

46:22.960 --> 46:25.713
All set?
- Yeah. Yeah.

46:25.800 --> 46:28.758
Adam...could you get a bus?
