We've got to get in there
before Jesse does something

36:35.367 --> 36:36.585
stupider than usual.

36:36.628 --> 36:38.717
You listen to me.
Jesse is dead.

36:38.760 --> 36:40.371
You have to
remember that.

36:40.414 --> 36:43.679
When you see him, you're not
looking at your friend.

36:43.722 --> 36:46.204
You're looking at the thing
that killed him.

36:54.733 --> 36:56.952
Almost free.

36:56.996 --> 36:58.650
[low growling]

36:58.693 --> 37:02.001
Give me more!

37:07.181 --> 37:08.226
This one's mine.

They're all
for the master.

I can feel the master's
strength growing!

I feel him rising!

Every soul
brings him closer!

37:36.253 --> 37:39.081
I need another!

The vessel.

37:41.824 --> 37:43.347
[low growl]

37:43.391 --> 37:46.873
Tonight is his ascension.

37:46.916 --> 37:50.876
Tonight will be history
at its end!

37:50.920 --> 37:54.184
Yours is
a glorious sacrifice.

37:54.228 --> 37:57.362
Degradation... most holy.

38:01.626 --> 38:02.628
What?

38:02.670 --> 38:04.150
No volunteers?

in the middle of something?

You!

38:20.340 --> 38:22.864
You didn't think
I'd miss this, did you?

38:22.909 --> 38:25.172
I hoped you'd come.

38:25.215 --> 38:26.956

Okay, vessel boy.

Do you want blood?

38:47.411 --> 38:49.588
I want yours.

38:49.630 --> 38:51.590
Only yours.

don't make me do it.

to kill a slayer.

Okay...

40:34.867 --> 40:37.304
let's
deal with this.

40:37.347 --> 40:39.219
Jesse was an
excruciating loser

40:39.262 --> 40:41.786
who couldn't get a date with
anyone in the sighted community.

Well, we averted
the apocalypse.

42:55.224 --> 42:56.661
I give us points for that.

42:56.704 --> 42:59.184
One thing's for sure:

42:59.228 --> 43:01.969
nothing's ever going
to be the same.

43:05.670 --> 43:07.715
CORDELIA:
Well, I heard
it was rival gangs,

43:07.759 --> 43:09.150
you know,
fighting for turf.

43:09.195 --> 43:10.413
But all I can tell you is,

43:10.456 --> 43:12.153
they were an ugly way
of looking.

43:12.197 --> 43:13.677
And Buffy, like, knew them,

43:13.721 --> 43:15.157
which is just too weird.

43:15.201 --> 43:16.811
I mean, I don't even
remember that much,

43:16.855 --> 43:18.682
but I'm telling you,
it was a freak show.

43:18.726 --> 43:20.293
Oh, I wish
I'd been there.

43:20.335 --> 43:23.731
You should have been there.
It was so creepy.

43:23.775 --> 43:25.777
What exactly
were you expecting?

43:25.820 --> 43:27.561
I don't know. Something.

43:27.605 --> 43:28.867
I mean, the dead rose.

43:28.909 --> 43:30.389
We should have at least
had an assembly.

43:30.432 --> 43:31.434
People
have a tendency

43:31.478 --> 43:33.219
to rationalize
what they can

43:33.262 --> 43:34.742
and forget
what they can't.

43:34.786 --> 43:36.657
Believe me, I've seen it happen.

43:36.701 --> 43:38.746
Well, I'll never forget it.
None of it.

43:38.789 --> 43:40.661
Good. Next time
you'll be prepared.

43:40.704 --> 43:41.661
Next time?

43:41.706 --> 43:43.141
Next time is why?

43:43.184 --> 43:45.056
We prevented the master
from freeing himself

43:45.099 --> 43:46.753
and opening
the mouth of hell.

43:46.797 --> 43:48.713
That's not to say he's
going to stop trying.

43:48.755 --> 43:50.105
I'd say the fun
is just beginning.

Not just vampires.

something quite different.

hardly wait.

We're at the center of a
mystical convergence here.

44:00.159 --> 44:01.768
We may, in fact,

44:01.813 --> 44:05.643
stand between the earth
and its total destruction.

44:05.686 --> 44:07.427
Well, I got to look
on the bright side.

44:07.469 --> 44:09.429
Maybe I can still get
kicked out of school.

44:09.472 --> 44:10.952
Oh, yeah.
That's a plan,

44:10.996 --> 44:12.606
'cause lots of schools
aren't on hellmouths.

44:12.650 --> 44:13.954
WILLOW: Maybe you could
blow something up.

44:13.998 --> 44:15.695
They're really strict
about that.

44:15.739 --> 44:17.742
BUFFY: I was thinking
of a more subtle approach,

44:17.784 --> 44:20.570
you know, like,
excessive not studying.

44:20.614 --> 44:22.442
The earth is doomed.

45:02.134 --> 45:04.570
Grr. Argh.
