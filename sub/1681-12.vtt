WEBVTT

00:01.410 --> 00:03.310
Kids, in the winter of 2009

00:03.310 --> 00:05.360
aunt Robin and I just become roomates.

00:05.360 --> 00:07.700
and to be honest, it wasn't going very smoothly.

00:07.730 --> 00:08.430
Ooh,that looks good.

00:08.460 --> 00:09.830
I'm gonna get some.

00:09.860 --> 00:10.660
There's no more milk.

00:10.700 --> 00:11.630
No,I just saw some in the fridge.

00:11.660 --> 00:12.760
Empty.

00:12.800 --> 00:13.830
So throw it out.

00:13.860 --> 00:15.300
The trash can's full.

00:15.330 --> 00:17.030
So take the trash out.

00:17.060 --> 00:19.660
I'm eating cereal.

00:19.700 --> 00:23.160
You know,when I asked you to be my roommate,I figured,

00:23.200 --> 00:25.430
"She's a girl,she'll be neat."

00:25.460 --> 00:28.460
But no,you're Ogre from Revenge of the Nerds.

00:28.500 --> 00:30.430
You know what,Ted?

00:30.460 --> 00:32.299
Instead of coming up with hot off the press

00:32.299 --> 00:34.100
topical references like that,

00:34.130 --> 00:36.130
maybe you should spend a little time,

00:36.160 --> 00:39.300
I don't know,uh, washing a dish ever.

00:39.330 --> 00:41.430
Oh,darn,I can't.

00:41.460 --> 00:44.630
I'm too busy leaving a plate of cookies for the magical elf

00:44.660 --> 00:46.300
who changes the toilet paper roll.

00:46.330 --> 00:48.230
Oh,wait,there's no elf.

00:48.260 --> 00:49.100
It's always me!

00:49.130 --> 00:51.530
I alwa change it. You never do!

00:51.560 --> 00:53.200
-That is ridiculous! -No,I went in there yesterday...

00:53.230 --> 00:55.000
I changed it,like, the last five times.

00:55.030 --> 00:56.000
Stop! Stop!

00:56.030 --> 00:57.930
God,what is going on?

00:57.960 --> 00:59.030
When we were dating each other,

00:59.030 --> 01:01.130
we were practically living together

01:01.160 --> 01:02.860
and we didn't drive each other this crazy.

01:02.860 --> 01:03.930
I know.

01:03.930 --> 01:05.160
What happened?

01:05.200 --> 01:07.260
You know what it is?

01:07.300 --> 01:08.700
We were having sex.

01:08.730 --> 01:11.530
Men and women need sex to live together.

01:11.560 --> 01:13.400
It solves all disputes.

01:13.430 --> 01:16.360
Oh,like Barney's theory about world peace?

01:16.400 --> 01:17.700
So I explained to her.

01:17.730 --> 01:21.430
I said,Madeline,every single international conflict

01:21.460 --> 01:24.600
essentially boils down to sexual tension.

01:24.630 --> 01:26.460
Every international conflict?

01:26.500 --> 01:27.600
Every single one,dude.

01:27.630 --> 01:30.860
So the crisis in the Middle East could be solved by...

01:30.900 --> 01:33.100
Gaza Strippers. Next.

01:33.130 --> 01:34.530
Apartheid?

01:34.530 --> 01:37.730
Apart thighs. What else you got?

01:37.760 --> 01:39.230
Cold War?

01:39.260 --> 01:43.400
"Mrs. Gorbachev, take down those pants."

01:45.260 --> 01:48.830
Well,guess we should just start having sex,then.

01:48.860 --> 01:50.530
Yeah,right.

01:51.600 --> 01:53.060
Wow.

01:53.100 --> 01:54.460
I know.

01:54.500 --> 01:56.460
It's like riding a bike,huh,buddy?

01:56.500 --> 01:59.460
Riding a bike upside down, maybe.

01:59.500 --> 02:02.200
Okay,listen. If this is gonna happen on occasion,

02:02.230 --> 02:04.330
we can't tell anyone about this.

02:04.360 --> 02:05.860
-Deal? Deal.

02:05.900 --> 02:06.900
Deal.

02:23.600 --> 02:24.940
Marshall,Marshall...

02:24.970 --> 02:26.340
What the hell are you guys doing?

02:26.370 --> 02:28.340
What,are you guys, like,back together?

02:28.370 --> 02:31.170
No. We're just having sex so we don't fight ghymore.

02:31.200 --> 02:33.470
Oh,that's a great idea.

02:33.500 --> 02:35.400
No,really. Two thumbs up,guys.

02:35.440 --> 02:37.340
Hey,I just looked into the future

02:37.470 --> 02:39.700
and that works out really great for everyone.

02:39.740 --> 02:41.770
What are you even doing here?

02:41.800 --> 02:46.870
I was on my way to work and I just had to drop by here to...

02:46.900 --> 02:48.140
read this magazine.

02:49.070 --> 02:50.340
In...

02:50.340 --> 02:52.270
that room over there.

02:52.300 --> 02:53.970
Oh,I get it.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.570
No problem,buddy.

02:55.600 --> 02:57.440
Uh,yes, a problem,buddy.

02:57.470 --> 03:00.240
You came all the way over here to read a magazine?

03:00.240 --> 03:04.970
I'm willing to bet that there is a place to read a magazine at work.

03:04.970 --> 03:07.700
You know,a room with a little man on the door?

03:07.740 --> 03:10.340
Okay,Robin. Come on.

03:10.370 --> 03:12.770
Nobody likes to read a magazine at work.

03:12.800 --> 03:16.000
I mean,you walk out of your office holding a magazine

03:16.040 --> 03:19.940
and that magazine is saying one thing and one thing only.

03:19.970 --> 03:22.870
Hey everyone,look at what Marshall's about to do!

03:22.900 --> 03:26.070
Marshall's about to read a big ol' magazine

03:26.100 --> 03:29.000
in the bathroom that you all share with him.

03:31.200 --> 03:33.900
Well,have you thought about maybe not reading

03:33.940 --> 03:35.670
a magazine when you read a magazine?

03:35.700 --> 03:37.770
You gotta read a magazine.

03:37.800 --> 03:39.640
I mean, that's why there's magazines.

03:39.670 --> 03:41.670
Otherwise,it's just time you're not getting back.

03:41.700 --> 03:43.300
Exactly.

03:43.340 --> 03:44.600
And the worst part is this:

03:44.640 --> 03:48.240
That stretch of hallway from my door to that restroom

03:48.270 --> 03:52.500
is a gauntlet of judging eyes.

03:52.540 --> 03:53.870
You got my boss.

03:53.900 --> 03:57.440
We all know exactly  what you're about to do.

03:58.470 --> 03:59.940
Her boss.

03:59.970 --> 04:01.340
Hey,Eriksen,

04:01.370 --> 04:03.270
why don't you just move your desk in there?

04:03.270 --> 04:06.170
I-Can't-Believe-He-Has-A-Wife Donald.

04:06.200 --> 04:09.000
Oh,sweetie,so obvious.

04:09.870 --> 04:13.570
Anyways,I just would rather do that here.

04:13.600 --> 04:14.970
No,I'm sorry.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.339
This is our apartment now.

04:16.370 --> 04:19.700
Marshall,you have to read a magazine someplace else.

04:19.740 --> 04:20.700
Give me your key.

04:20.740 --> 04:22.700
Yeah,I'm not gonna do that.

04:23.240 --> 04:23.970
Marshall.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.140
I seem to recall

04:25.170 --> 04:27.600
a deal being struck between three parties

04:27.640 --> 04:29.440
wherein none would discuss

04:29.470 --> 04:32.470
a certain event that transpired.

04:32.500 --> 04:34.670
An event of the...

04:34.700 --> 04:35.900
...persuasion.

04:35.940 --> 04:38.540
That key,madam, buys my silence.

04:39.440 --> 04:40.800
Good day to you both.

04:42.940 --> 04:44.270
You two hooked up?

04:45.170 --> 04:46.970
thanks a lot,lily

04:47.970 --> 04:49.570
So,wow.

04:49.600 --> 04:52.040
You two... slept together.

04:52.070 --> 04:54.670
That is awf... some.

04:55.640 --> 04:57.240
Awfsome.

04:57.270 --> 04:59.670
Nice work,Ted. Tap that.

04:59.700 --> 05:02.000
It sounds like a bigger deal than it is.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.340
We talked it over,and we both realized

05:04.340 --> 05:06.140
we've had a rough couple of months.

05:06.170 --> 05:07.040
We deserve a little fun.

05:07.070 --> 05:08.170
No.

05:08.170 --> 05:10.340
This could wind up ruining your friendship.

05:10.340 --> 05:13.400
When two exes try to "just be casual,"

05:13.440 --> 05:15.500
someone always winds up getting hurt.

05:15.540 --> 05:17.200
Turned out,Lily was right.

05:17.240 --> 05:19.270
But more on that later.

05:19.300 --> 05:21.200
Look,guys,we've got this covered okay?

05:21.240 --> 05:22.440
No one's gonna get hurt.

05:22.440 --> 05:24.500
We set up ground rules.

05:24.540 --> 05:26.070
Okay,rule number one:

05:26.100 --> 05:27.970
This is strictly a physical relationship.

05:28.000 --> 05:28.840
There are no feelings involved, okay?

05:28.870 --> 05:31.740
Oh,please,that's like telling the Fonz to be cool.

05:31.770 --> 05:33.500
And since it's just physical,

05:33.540 --> 05:35.240
we don't have to worry about romance,right?

05:35.270 --> 05:36.070
Hell,no.

05:36.100 --> 05:37.440
Ooh,we can do it while we watch TV!

05:37.670 --> 05:38.640
Totally!

05:38.670 --> 05:40.100
And we can multi-task.

05:40.140 --> 05:42.840
You know,use the sex to spice up otherwise dull activities.

05:42.870 --> 05:44.100
Like folding laundry.

05:44.140 --> 05:45.100
Paying bills.

05:45.140 --> 05:46.800
Cooking dinner.

05:46.840 --> 05:49.300
-That doesn't seem hygienic. -Yeah,not that one.

05:49.340 --> 05:52.100
And now that we're hooking up, we're not fighting anymore.

05:52.140 --> 05:53.300
Problem solved.

05:53.300 --> 05:55.100
Actually,the credit belongs to Barney.

05:55.140 --> 05:57.300
This whole idea came out of your thing about world peace.

05:57.340 --> 05:58.770
Yeah. Thanks,Barney.

05:58.800 --> 06:01.440
You were right. Peace was achieved.

06:01.470 --> 06:03.540
Repeatedly.

06:04.270 --> 06:06.570
So I'm-I'm responsible for...

06:06.740 --> 06:11.100
Excellent. Excellent. Excellent.

06:11.140 --> 06:14.670
Uh... next round's on me!

06:19.440 --> 06:20.570
Hey,are you okay?

06:20.600 --> 06:21.670
Yeah. Why do you ask?

06:21.700 --> 06:24.700
Well,for one thing, you're openly weeping.

06:25.740 --> 06:28.340
With joy.

06:28.370 --> 06:30.440
So happy for those two.

06:30.470 --> 06:32.400
Barney,admit it.

06:32.440 --> 06:34.500
You still have feelings for Robin

06:34.540 --> 06:36.040
and this is killing you.

06:36.040 --> 06:38.340
I am totally fine.

06:38.640 --> 06:41.070
Now,excuse me for just a minute.

06:43.000 --> 06:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:53.800 --> 06:55.540
I'm totally fine.

06:55.570 --> 06:58.440
Barney,you have to learn how to express these feelings.

06:58.470 --> 07:00.770
Maybe you should talk to a psychiatrist.

07:00.800 --> 07:02.300
Please.

07:02.340 --> 07:04.770
If I'm gonna pay so woman $200 an hour

07:04.800 --> 07:08.640
to make me feel better, we aren't going to be talking.

07:08.670 --> 07:11.100
And we're both going to be on that couch.

07:12.800 --> 07:15.540
The woman in this scenario is a prostitute.

07:17.170 --> 07:20.770
A dirty,skanky,surgically enhanced,Eastern European...

07:20.900 --> 07:21.640
I got it.

07:22.400 --> 07:23.540
And there's something kind of liberating

07:23.570 --> 07:24.700
about not taking it all too seriously.

07:24.740 --> 07:26.640
Yeah. Last night, we actually did it

07:26.670 --> 07:28.840
while I was returning a bunch of phone calls.

07:28.870 --> 07:32.100
I knew you didn't get a rowing machine!

07:34.470 --> 07:37.200
Awesome, we're still talking about this!

07:37.840 --> 07:38.970
Look,guys,

07:39.000 --> 07:41.140
this is a private thing between me and Ted.

07:41.170 --> 07:42.300
Private Thing.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.900
We wouldn't even be talking about this

07:44.940 --> 07:47.800
if Marshall could read a magazine at work.

07:47.840 --> 07:49.500
Oh,he's always been this way.

07:49.540 --> 07:51.370
Remember law school?

07:51.400 --> 07:52.800
Sure do.

07:56.770 --> 07:58.570
Baby?

07:58.600 --> 07:59.740
Baby,what is it?

07:59.770 --> 08:02.700
The credit card bill came today.

08:02.740 --> 08:06.270
You checked into a hotel two blocks from school

08:06.300 --> 08:07.940
on a Tuesday.

08:07.970 --> 08:09.170
It's not what you think.

08:09.200 --> 08:10.940
Who is she,Marshall?

08:10.970 --> 08:12.800
What's her name?

08:12.840 --> 08:15.100
Burrito.

08:15.140 --> 08:17.100
Carnitas Burrito.

08:17.140 --> 08:19.900
So,you checked into a hotel room

08:19.940 --> 08:22.470
just so you could read a magazine there?

08:22.500 --> 08:24.600
Hey,Robin,do you want me to see if the waitress has

08:24.640 --> 08:28.470
any giant sugar cubes for that high horse of yours?

08:28.500 --> 08:30.200
Nobody likes to read a magazine at work

08:30.240 --> 08:33.100
and if they say that they do, then they're not human.

08:33.140 --> 08:35.600
Dude,I read a magazine at work every day.

08:35.640 --> 08:38.440
I can't tell you how many meetings I've been late to

08:38.470 --> 08:40.570
because I was busy "reading a magazine."

08:40.600 --> 08:42.840
But I don't feel bad about it. That's my time.

08:43.840 --> 08:46.770
Sure,"reading a magazine" ain't pretty,

08:46.800 --> 08:48.970
but,you know, it's something I gotta do.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.640
So why be ashamed about it?

08:52.740 --> 08:55.940
Wait,"reading a magazine" means masturbating,right?

08:57.840 --> 08:59.400
I can't believe it.

08:59.440 --> 09:01.070
You drank all my milk again!

09:01.700 --> 09:03.640
We can have sex.

09:03.670 --> 09:04.670
Okay.

09:06.900 --> 09:08.240
It's the perfect set up.

09:08.270 --> 09:10.170
Anytime we start getting into an argument,

09:10.200 --> 09:11.470
we just have sex instead.

09:11.470 --> 09:13.370
One minute we're just laying into each other,

09:13.400 --> 09:14.870
and then the next minute...

09:14.900 --> 09:16.100
Well,same thing.

09:17.170 --> 09:18.840
Awesome.

09:22.100 --> 09:24.670
So,this morning,she's yelling at me through the door,

09:24.700 --> 09:26.500
"You're taking too long in the shower!"

09:26.540 --> 09:27.670
Next thing I know,

09:27.700 --> 09:29.040
she hops in.

09:30.200 --> 09:33.000
Now baby don't mind I took my time.

09:34.040 --> 09:35.500
So awesome.

09:38.540 --> 09:39.670
Sorry I'm late.

09:39.700 --> 09:42.040
I was just jammin' on Scherbatsky.

09:42.070 --> 09:44.970
She used up all my stamps, so long story short,

09:45.000 --> 09:47.170
the postman rang twice.

09:47.200 --> 09:48.940
You must bump this!

09:49.970 --> 09:55.040
That's just so...

09:55.070 --> 09:57.000
Excuse me for a second.

10:08.400 --> 10:10.900
So,you're saying plasmas are better for low light,

10:10.940 --> 10:13.440
but LCDs are better for games?

10:13.470 --> 10:16.700
Right,but the CRTs have the truest blacks.

10:16.700 --> 10:20.370
So,if I want a really crisp contrast ratio...

10:20.400 --> 10:22.770
The CRT's deep-pixel cell structure produces

10:22.800 --> 10:25.140
a resolution you just can't match with an LCD.

10:25.170 --> 10:27.770
Huh... I'll take the CRT.

10:32.100 --> 10:33.600
Barney, this is nuts.

10:33.640 --> 10:35.640
I'm doing just fine, thank you.

10:35.670 --> 10:37.570
No,you're not.

10:37.600 --> 10:39.640
You need to learn to let this stuff out.

10:39.670 --> 10:42.170
Like we do in my kindergarten class

10:42.200 --> 10:44.300
"Feelings Hour" every Tuesday morning.

10:44.340 --> 10:46.400
Look,Lily,maybe yourindergartners

10:46.440 --> 10:47.970
are upset that their friends are sleeping with each other,

10:48.000 --> 10:48.970
but not me.

10:50.170 --> 10:51.900
I have never been better.

10:51.940 --> 10:54.440
Meanwhile,Marshall was still struggling at work.

10:56.300 --> 10:57.400
Coming through.

10:57.440 --> 10:59.070
Big breakfast this morning.

10:59.100 --> 11:01.000
You know what that means.

11:01.140 --> 11:04.940
But then came the best news  he'd heard in a long time.

11:04.970 --> 11:06.340
And did you hear?

11:06.370 --> 11:08.440
They laid off everybody on the eighth floor.

11:08.470 --> 11:11.340
I know. It's a ghost town down there.

11:35.840 --> 11:37.000
Morning.

11:37.040 --> 11:38.000
Morning.

11:38.040 --> 11:39.170
Hey,that was fun last night.

11:39.200 --> 11:41.300
Word,that was a good one.

11:41.340 --> 11:42.040
Mental note:

11:42.070 --> 11:44.770
don't throw out the pizza box more often.

11:45.400 --> 11:47.000
All right,see you later.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.400
So last night,Robin left a pizza box out on the floor,

12:02.430 --> 12:04.260
-so we had sex three times. -Sure.

12:04.300 --> 12:06.730
And then,this morning before I left for work...

12:06.760 --> 12:07.900
we kissed.

12:07.930 --> 12:09.300
Ooh,that's weird.

12:09.330 --> 12:10.960
That is weird.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.360
Right?

12:12.400 --> 12:14.130
That kiss violated the spirit

12:14.200 --> 12:15.230
Of our whole arrangement.

12:15.260 --> 12:17.260
I mean,she probably thinks I'm getting feelings for her.

12:17.300 --> 12:18.760
Well,are you?

12:18.800 --> 12:20.560
Yes,I'm in love with her.

12:21.930 --> 12:22.930
Is what you--

12:22.960 --> 12:24.500
That's you,dude.

12:25.560 --> 12:27.460
No. It didn't mean anything.

12:27.500 --> 12:30.360
It was just some leftover reflex from when we were a couple.

12:30.400 --> 12:31.760
But I think I probably blew it.

12:31.800 --> 12:33.960
Definitely.

12:34.760 --> 12:37.730
It is so over.

12:37.760 --> 12:38.800
Hold the phone.

12:38.830 --> 12:40.100
Maybe Robin didn't think it was weird.

12:40.130 --> 12:41.500
It was weird.

12:41.530 --> 12:43.900
Weird,weird,weird, weird,weird.

12:43.930 --> 12:46.930
W-I-E-R-D. Weird.

12:46.960 --> 12:48.200
That's not how you spell "weird."

12:48.230 --> 12:50.000
Come on,Lily. Nobody likes a Ted.

12:51.060 --> 12:52.330
I tried to warn you.

12:52.360 --> 12:55.730
When exes relapse, someone always gets hurt.

12:55.760 --> 12:57.230
But no one listened.

12:57.260 --> 12:58.530
Story of my life.

12:58.560 --> 13:01.300
My cuteness interferes with people hearing my message.

13:01.330 --> 13:02.800
Well,what should I do?

13:02.830 --> 13:05.000
There's only one thing to do.

13:05.030 --> 13:08.460
You have to stop sleeping together,please.

13:08.500 --> 13:10.630
I think we have to stop sleeping together.

13:10.660 --> 13:11.730
With me and Ted,

13:11.760 --> 13:13.700
it's like cigarettes.

13:13.730 --> 13:15.900
You have one when you're drunk and you think it's fine.

13:15.930 --> 13:18.500
But before you know it, you're buying a carton a week.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.400
I think I have to end it.

13:20.430 --> 13:21.600
Yup.

13:21.630 --> 13:22.660
I have to end it.

13:22.700 --> 13:24.200
So...

13:24.230 --> 13:25.960
We're ending it,huh?

13:26.000 --> 13:27.530
I think so,yeah.

13:27.560 --> 13:29.130
It's probably for the best.

13:29.530 --> 13:30.630
It was fun,

13:30.660 --> 13:32.000
but I don't want things to get weird.

13:32.030 --> 13:32.830
Me neither.

13:32.860 --> 13:33.660
Roomies?

13:33.700 --> 13:34.700
Roomies.

13:38.460 --> 13:39.700
Robin!

13:39.730 --> 13:41.060
But we tell no one.

13:41.100 --> 13:42.060
Deal?

13:42.100 --> 13:43.060
Deal.

13:43.100 --> 13:44.600
-Deal. -Dude!

13:44.630 --> 13:45.860
Come on!

13:45.860 --> 13:47.160
What is the matter with you?

13:49.460 --> 13:50.700
That one.

13:53.960 --> 13:55.530
So,that didn't last long.

13:56.760 --> 13:57.900
By the way,Marshall,

13:57.930 --> 13:59.630
what were you doing back in our apartment?

13:59.660 --> 14:01.700
I thought you had the perfect situation.

14:01.730 --> 14:03.760
I did.

14:03.800 --> 14:05.360
Everything was going great.

14:05.400 --> 14:07.360
I was feeling  comfortable,

14:07.400 --> 14:08.960
more confident.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.630
I felt I could  take on the world.

14:12.660 --> 14:15.360
One morning,I took my magazine  down to the eighth floor.

14:20.560 --> 14:21.800
We gotta gut this whole place.

14:21.830 --> 14:26.560
I need these walls taken out here and here.

14:26.600 --> 14:27.560
You got it.

14:27.600 --> 14:28.360
All right.

14:30.830 --> 14:33.530
Celebrities pick up their dry cleaning?

14:33.560 --> 14:34.900
I pick up my dry cleaning.

14:35.930 --> 14:37.930
Don't come in!

14:37.960 --> 14:40.030
So that didn't last long.

14:42.630 --> 14:43.760
Oh,thanks.

14:43.800 --> 14:45.360
What are you doing?

14:45.400 --> 14:47.960
Oh,well,since all these roomie squabbles

14:48.000 --> 14:49.760
are still causing friction between you and Robin,

14:49.800 --> 14:51.000
I thought I'd help out.

14:51.030 --> 14:53.230
Oh,BTW,I went by the post office today.

14:53.260 --> 14:54.530
I picked you up some stamps.

14:54.560 --> 14:56.760
Here's ten thousand. That oughta do ya.

14:56.760 --> 14:58.160
Um,okay.

14:58.200 --> 14:59.800
Thanks,I guess.

14:59.830 --> 15:01.260
Hey,uh,you want a beer?

15:01.300 --> 15:02.930
Okay.

15:05.230 --> 15:07.660
Yeah,I picked those up on the way over. It was nothing.

15:07.800 --> 15:10.860
Did you buy us a dishwasher?

15:10.900 --> 15:13.900
No. That dishwasher's always been there.

15:13.900 --> 15:15.400
How long have you been living here?

15:20.900 --> 15:22.900
So,you are doing these things

15:23.100 --> 15:25.700
to keep me and Robin from fighting,huh?

15:25.730 --> 15:27.000
Exactly.

15:27.030 --> 15:28.360
I worry about you two.

15:30.330 --> 15:33.430
It bothers you that Robin and I a hooking up,doesn't it?

15:34.460 --> 15:35.430
No.

15:35.460 --> 15:36.500
Not at all.

15:36.530 --> 15:38.030
That's crazy.

15:39.360 --> 15:41.930
What?

15:41.960 --> 15:44.500
Are you in love with Robin?

15:51.000 --> 15:52.930
You're in love with Robin.

15:52.970 --> 15:54.670
That's why you don't want us hooking up.

15:54.700 --> 15:57.300
What? That is crazy talk.

15:57.330 --> 15:59.930
Can't a bro clean another bro's apartment

15:59.970 --> 16:01.700
like bros do?

16:01.700 --> 16:04.130
Name me one bro in the history of bros

16:04.170 --> 16:05.170
who has ever done that.

16:08.730 --> 16:09.900
I'll name two:

16:09.930 --> 16:13.230
Misters Clean and Belvedere.

16:14.470 --> 16:16.070
Look,this thing with me and Robin,

16:16.100 --> 16:17.100
it's totally casual.

16:17.130 --> 16:18.230
I'm not gonna freak out

16:18.270 --> 16:19.430
if you tell me you have feelings for her.

16:19.470 --> 16:20.730
So,do you?

16:20.770 --> 16:21.830
No. No,I don't.

16:21.870 --> 16:23.000
I don't,no.

16:23.030 --> 16:24.130
I don't. I don't. No.

16:24.170 --> 16:25.730
Robin is all yours,dude.

16:25.770 --> 16:27.770
Have fun with her.

16:27.800 --> 16:30.570
Now,if you'll excuse me,

16:30.600 --> 16:32.330
I'm gonna go sleep with other girls.

16:32.370 --> 16:33.530
Are you sure?

16:33.570 --> 16:34.530
Yes!

16:34.570 --> 16:35.730
Positive?

16:35.730 --> 16:37.500
Absolutely.

16:39.830 --> 16:41.670
And then I stormed out.

16:41.700 --> 16:44.770
Why did I do that?

16:44.800 --> 16:47.700
I mean,maybe it goes back to my father issues,but...

16:47.730 --> 16:50.370
I basically gave my best friend license

16:50.400 --> 16:53.330
to have sex with the girl of my dreams.

16:53.370 --> 16:55.400
totally sabotaged myself.

16:57.030 --> 16:58.030
And now I'm smoking.

16:58.070 --> 17:00.500
Now I'm smoking.

17:00.530 --> 17:02.800
Get out.

17:02.830 --> 17:05.000
But it's feelings hour

17:05.030 --> 17:07.130
and I'm holding Feely the Share Bear.

17:07.170 --> 17:09.030
And whoever's holding Feely the Share Bear

17:09.069 --> 17:10.970
gets to sit in the share chair.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.829
Barney,this is not your private therapist's office.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.369
These kids have issues to talk about,too,you know.

17:17.400 --> 17:19.230
Ben's parents are getting divorced.

17:19.270 --> 17:20.700
They are?

17:21.770 --> 17:23.970
Who wants to do some coloring?

17:27.400 --> 17:29.570
Oh,great,did Lily send you?

17:29.600 --> 17:31.330
I don't have the bear,okay?

17:31.670 --> 17:33.000
I'm not giving it back!

17:34.430 --> 17:35.900
Why are you smiling?

17:36.930 --> 17:39.030
Oh,I just...

17:39.070 --> 17:40.800
read a magazine.

17:40.830 --> 17:42.000
Here at work.

17:42.030 --> 17:43.570
What?

17:43.600 --> 17:45.330
Yeah. It's the funniest thing.

17:45.370 --> 17:47.900
I was online, looking up rates for hotels

17:47.930 --> 17:50.030
when I realized something.

17:50.070 --> 17:51.970
This is stupid.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.530
I decided it was time to let go of my hang-ups

17:54.570 --> 17:56.730
and do the thing I gotta do

17:56.770 --> 17:59.430
and once I made that decision, everything changed.

18:02.600 --> 18:06.600
There's a young man who's comfortable  with who he is.

18:11.330 --> 18:14.300
I know what you're about to do  and I respect you for it.

18:15.270 --> 18:16.400
Hey,Eriksen.

18:16.430 --> 18:18.730
Go the distance.

18:26.200 --> 18:27.900
Marshall,

18:27.930 --> 18:30.230
you made a brave step today.

18:30.270 --> 18:31.700
Remember what Shakespeare wrote:

18:31.730 --> 18:35.900
"Virtue is bold, and goodness never fearful."

18:35.930 --> 18:39.530
Yoreu'ight, Super Hot Lady Who My Wife Keeps

18:39.570 --> 18:42.200
Telling Me Why You're Famous But I Keep Forgetting.

18:42.230 --> 18:43.200
Let's do this.

18:43.230 --> 18:45.900
Lead the way.

18:49.230 --> 18:50.500
Wow,Marshall.

18:50.530 --> 18:51.670
Congratulations.

18:51.700 --> 18:53.000
Thanks.

18:53.030 --> 18:54.430
I was gonna ve to do it eventually.

18:54.470 --> 18:55.730
You know,sometimes you just gotta...

18:55.770 --> 18:59.130
you gotta man up and... and just go for it.

19:00.870 --> 19:02.770
Marshall,I have to go.

19:04.230 --> 19:05.500
Oh,by the way,

19:05.530 --> 19:07.500
I have a bathroom here if you ever want to use it.

19:12.100 --> 19:12.970
Son of a...

19:13.630 --> 19:15.700
Ted,I have to tell you the truth.

19:15.730 --> 19:16.970
I'm in love with...

19:17.000 --> 19:18.330
tacos.

19:19.530 --> 19:20.500
What are you doing?

19:20.530 --> 19:22.430
I'm,uh,taking out the triz-ash.

19:23.200 --> 19:25.970
If you're,uh,looking for Ted,he left.

19:28.070 --> 19:31.600
our little arrangement is,uh,over,by the way.

19:31.630 --> 19:33.770
Really? That's aws... ful.

19:33.800 --> 19:35.570
Awfsful?

19:35.600 --> 19:38.230
Yeah,it's just awfsful.

19:38.770 --> 19:39.600
What happened?

19:39.630 --> 19:41.200
Ah,he just insisted.

19:41.530 --> 19:43.170
He said he couldn't do it anymore because

19:43.200 --> 19:44.530
"someone's gonna get hurt."

19:44.570 --> 19:46.970
think we all know who he meant by that.

19:48.200 --> 19:49.730
Do we?

19:50.700 --> 19:51.900
Isn't it obvious?

19:52.030 --> 19:53.700
Is it?

19:53.730 --> 19:54.600
Yeah.

19:55.500 --> 19:56.670
It's Ted.

19:58.030 --> 19:59.400
You know what a romantic he is.

19:59.430 --> 20:01.130
He can't separate the physical from the emotional.

20:01.170 --> 20:02.130
He'sll like...

20:02.170 --> 20:03.030
I love you.

20:03.070 --> 20:03.900
Exactly.

20:04.830 --> 20:06.870
He's not like you,you know?

20:07.870 --> 20:09.170
Besides,we're friends.

20:09.200 --> 20:12.370
I don't want to screw that up by getting involved.

20:12.400 --> 20:14.330
Dating friends never works out.

20:15.830 --> 20:18.500
So,uh,you want to get a taco?

20:19.530 --> 20:20.630
A taco?

20:20.670 --> 20:22.870
You love them,remember?

20:23.900 --> 20:25.630
Right.

20:25.670 --> 20:26.500
Come on,I'm hungry.

20:36.870 --> 20:40.170
So Robin and I went back to just being roommates

20:40.200 --> 20:42.330
and things went back to normal.

20:42.370 --> 20:44.400
Your Aunt Lily was right.

20:44.430 --> 20:46.430
When two exes decide  to just be casual,
