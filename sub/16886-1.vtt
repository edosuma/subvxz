Sometimes the accidents are big,
and sometimes they're small.

tell us about the boy,

from a medical point of view?

19:22.840 --> 19:24.479
[DALTON] Louis was a bit disturbed.

19:24.760 --> 19:26.160
He had been seeing a therapist,

19:26.240 --> 19:27.276
a Dr. Michael...

19:29.160 --> 19:31.277
Perez.

19:34.840 --> 19:38.595
Um, disruptive at school,
no friends, doesn't fit in.

19:38.680 --> 19:40.512
The other kids called him "Whacko Boy".

19:41.440 --> 19:44.876
Now, looking through his records, there's
a recurring theme of physical trauma.

19:45.440 --> 19:47.397
It's difficult to get
to the bottom of that one.

19:47.480 --> 19:49.437
His therapist thinks that he may have been

19:49.520 --> 19:51.432
self-harming for attention.

19:52.080 --> 19:53.912
But the admissions go back to infancy.

19:54.920 --> 19:55.910
I noted this also.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.310
So there's a history
of violence from the father.

19:59.760 --> 20:01.831
What's the chances that this boy
is going to wake up?

20:03.120 --> 20:04.873
Well, based on his most recent EEG,

20:04.960 --> 20:07.395
I have diagnosed
a persistent vegetative state.

20:07.480 --> 20:08.755

20:09.040 --> 20:10.793
It means not good.

[NATALIE] I spoke to Dr. Janek
this morning

20:16.560 --> 20:18.756
about your awareness accretion theory.

20:19.040 --> 20:20.872
He said that your methods are radical,

20:21.640 --> 20:24.439
that you believe in your patients
when others don't.

20:24.640 --> 20:26.757
Well I don't know
how radical my methods are.

20:28.160 --> 20:30.470
I just believe that Louis
can still sense things.

20:32.080 --> 20:34.037
Though he may appear to be far away,

20:34.120 --> 20:35.440
he's still with us in some way.

20:36.880 --> 20:39.190
Do you think that the brain
is the same as the soul?

20:40.160 --> 20:43.232
I mean, if Louis' brain is damaged,
is he still Louis?

20:44.960 --> 20:47.031
He's still Louis.

20:51.840 --> 20:53.718
We just need to find a way through to him,

- [MONSTER WITHOUT A FACE] You hear that?
- [LOUIS] It's Pascal.

01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:03.680
He's reading to me
about monster tubeworms.

01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:07.870
They're gross to look at
because one end's a butt

01:17:07.960 --> 01:17:10.350
- and the other's a mouth.

- The Little Prince.
- Blah, blah, blah. Too babyish.

Yes.

Once upon a time...

01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:35.276
there were three bats...

01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:39.389
one male and two female.

01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:42.994
One of the female bats
was always laughing,

01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:47.233
and the other female bat
was always crying.

01:17:47.320 --> 01:17:50.757
And the male bat
had to choose between them.

01:17:50.840 --> 01:17:53.150
- To mate with?
- Yes!

01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:55.840
Yes.

01:17:56.600 --> 01:17:58.034
You see...

01:17:58.360 --> 01:18:02.832
he was in love with the laughing bat.

01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:08.510
But he felt sorry for the crying bat.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.196
She seemed to need him more.

01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:20.476
He thought if he loved her enough,
he could stop her from crying.

01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:22.678
Why was she crying?

01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:29.716
Because it made people
feel sorry... for her.

01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:34.069
And she liked that feeling

01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:38.996
more than she liked jokes or love.

01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:43.754
What happened to you?

01:18:44.680 --> 01:18:46.751
I was happy

01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:52.271
because I had a baby bat.

01:18:53.960 --> 01:18:58.557
And that bat was the most amazing bat

01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:01.952
in the entire world.

01:19:03.320 --> 01:19:09.396
And I... loved him more
than the whole house.

01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:11.199
More than the whole street?

01:19:12.360 --> 01:19:17.913
More than all the fish in the sea.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:22.472
But the baby bat had problems
and made everyone sad.

01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:23.596
No!

01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:25.716
No!

01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:31.157
He was perfect and smart...

01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:34.511

[JANEK] The body is badly decomposed
and bloated.

01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:21.077
The coroner has given us a dental ID.

01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:24.275
It seems he fell
from the cliff into the ravine

01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:25.999
and was swept into the cave.

01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:28.757
He suffered several breakages
and fractures.

01:20:29.480 --> 01:20:32.314
There were large quantities of sea matter
clogged in the intestine,

01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:34.392
which indicates he survived the fall.

01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:36.670
He didn't die on impact?

01:20:37.720 --> 01:20:39.154
Most likely pneumonia.

01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:47.229
You have a ballpark idea how long
he was in the cave before he died?

01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:49.591
One week. Maybe two.

You were sleeping so deeply.

Um, it's, uh... 6:00.

I'm sorry, I should've woken you earlier.

Was I snoring?

- No, you were sleepwalking.
- What?

01:21:41.320 --> 01:21:42.595
You were sitting next to Louis,

01:21:42.680 --> 01:21:45.400
and then you got up and came over here.

01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:48.157
And you just sat here for a while,

01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:49.833
and then you took out
your prescription pad

01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:53.391
and wrote out a prescription,
and then you crumpled it up

01:21:53.640 --> 01:21:55.677
and threw it in the trash.

01:21:55.840 --> 01:21:57.991
Then you got up...

01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:04.277
And you walked back to your chair
and went back to sleep.

01:22:06.120 --> 01:22:07.554
I'm sorry if I scared you.

and not only that, the exact right dosage?

01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:42.833
That seems like knowledge
belonging to a pharmacist.

You are not a suspect. You are...
eccentric, perhaps, but not a suspect.

Then why does this feel
like an interrogation?

like a coincidence to you?

Did you never suspect that she might
be involved in the accident?

What are you getting at?

01:25:30.080 --> 01:25:32.760

would have me write that prescription?

To who? What part? How strange?

are coming out of your head

through your frustrations, fears,
repressed thoughts, feelings...

01:31:36.080 --> 01:31:37.992
[PEREZ] What kind of food?

01:31:38.080 --> 01:31:41.437
[CHUCKLES] Of course
you would ask that, fatty.

01:31:41.560 --> 01:31:45.076
Mmm, you want a list?
I bet it makes you hungry.

01:31:45.400 --> 01:31:48.074
Sure. Give me a list.

01:31:49.480 --> 01:31:52.200
We had bread and pepperoni and cheese

01:31:52.520 --> 01:31:55.592
and beer for them and apple juice for me.

01:31:58.280 --> 01:31:59.760
Mom wanted me to slow down

01:31:59.840 --> 01:32:01.877
because she thought I'd get a stomachache.

01:32:02.200 --> 01:32:03.873
She's always scared that I'm going to puke

01:32:03.960 --> 01:32:06.316
or swallow a screw by accident.

01:32:06.680 --> 01:32:08.034
That can happen.

01:32:08.360 --> 01:32:10.591
I once ate a Phillips head by accident.

01:32:11.280 --> 01:32:14.079
You ask her.
She'll tell you. I'm not a liar.

01:32:14.560 --> 01:32:16.438
I know you're not a liar, Louis.

01:32:17.240 --> 01:32:18.674
Tell me more.

01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:21.760
About food? You want more food?

01:32:22.200 --> 01:32:23.554
[PEREZ] About anything.

01:32:25.080 --> 01:32:26.594
There was birthday cake.

01:32:26.920 --> 01:32:29.515
[LOUIS] Chocolate.
And you had to make a wish.

01:32:29.920 --> 01:32:32.276
Mom wished that I'd be hers forever

01:32:32.360 --> 01:32:34.033
and nothing bad would happen to me.

01:32:34.840 --> 01:32:36.479
[PEREZ] And your wish?

01:32:36.720 --> 01:32:38.871
[LOUIS] That my dad was my real dad

01:32:38.960 --> 01:32:40.440
so he'd stay with us.

01:32:42.280 --> 01:32:45.352
Did you tell them your wish,
or did you keep it to yourself?

01:32:46.720 --> 01:32:48.154
[LOUIS] Blah, blah, blah.

01:32:49.480 --> 01:32:50.709
What does that mean?

01:32:50.800 --> 01:32:54.157
[PASCAL AS LOUIS]
It means blah, blah, blah.

01:32:54.600 --> 01:32:56.000
Does that mean you kept it to yourself?

01:32:56.080 --> 01:32:59.118
It means that I was going to say it,

01:32:59.840 --> 01:33:03.878
but I didn't because Mom and Dad
started arguing about the candy.

01:33:04.280 --> 01:33:05.396
Me first.

01:33:06.920 --> 01:33:09.389
- What?
- Peter, I made these for Louis.

01:33:09.600 --> 01:33:12.069
[CHUCKLES] Louis, can I have one?

01:33:12.160 --> 01:33:13.355
Can he have one?

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:18.232
No, you can't because...
I made these for Louis.

01:33:18.360 --> 01:33:20.875
- Here.
- Stop it.

01:33:21.720 --> 01:33:23.916
- What is your problem?
- Pack your things, come on.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.674
- You always do this.
- Look at this, yet again.

01:33:26.760 --> 01:33:28.399
- You know what? You're drunk.
- Oh, my god.

01:33:28.480 --> 01:33:30.233
- Come on.
- Are we driving back with Dad?

01:33:30.320 --> 01:33:31.515
Of course you're driving back...

01:33:31.600 --> 01:33:33.034
We're not going home with you, okay?

01:33:33.120 --> 01:33:34.634
- You're drunk.
- I'm not drunk...

01:33:35.080 --> 01:33:37.037
Yeah, you're drunk,
and you're not allowed to drive like this.

01:33:37.160 --> 01:33:38.719
What's wrong with these candies?

01:33:38.840 --> 01:33:40.194
- Peter, give them back!
- What, I can't have one?

01:33:40.280 --> 01:33:41.555
Did you put something in these?

01:33:41.640 --> 01:33:42.960
- Stop it!
- Did you put something in...

01:33:43.040 --> 01:33:44.554
What are you doing? Give it back!

01:33:44.840 --> 01:33:47.116
Fine, fine.
All right, eat one. Eat one! Eat one!

01:33:47.280 --> 01:33:48.430
- No, what? Stop!
- Stop!

01:33:48.600 --> 01:33:49.636
What happened next?

01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:53.075
[PASCAL AS LOUIS]
I ran away, and she ran after me,

01:33:53.160 --> 01:33:54.196
and he ran after her.

01:33:54.280 --> 01:33:55.760
- [PETER] Louis!
- Louis! Louis!

01:33:56.320 --> 01:33:57.959
[PETER] Louis, wait, Louis.

01:33:58.040 --> 01:34:00.191
- Hey, buddy, wait.
- Stay away from us, Peter!

01:34:00.360 --> 01:34:01.396
[PASCAL] She dragged me to the edge.

01:34:01.480 --> 01:34:03.472
It's okay, come here. You're too close!

01:34:03.560 --> 01:34:04.789
Step back from the edge.

01:34:04.920 --> 01:34:06.513
[PASCAL AS LOUIS] It's allowed, you know.

01:34:06.920 --> 01:34:08.400
- You're too close, come here.
- [PEREZ] What's allowed?

01:34:08.480 --> 01:34:09.960
[PASCAL AS LOUIS] The right of disposal.

01:34:10.240 --> 01:34:12.072
- Louis, come here. Let go!
- Louis! No, Louis!

01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:14.630
[PASCAL AS LOUIS] Dad doesn't know
the rules. He didn't understand.

01:34:14.720 --> 01:34:16.757
No! Wait in the car!

01:34:17.080 --> 01:34:21.359
Why do you want to hurt him?
You need some serious help.

01:34:21.680 --> 01:34:25.833
[PASCAL AS LOUIS] She gave him this
huge push, and he wobbled like a cartoon.

01:34:26.200 --> 01:34:27.475
You can guess the rest.

01:34:30.400 --> 01:34:31.436
[PEREZ] He fell.

01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:36.071
[PASCAL AS LOUIS] It could've been
an accident. I know a lot about accidents.

01:34:36.160 --> 01:34:39.358
But... was it an accident, Louis?

01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:41.909
Was it really an accident?

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:43.036
Maybe it was.

01:34:43.400 --> 01:34:44.754
Maybe it wasn't.

01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:50.120
Then what happened?

01:34:54.360 --> 01:34:58.433
[PASCAL AS LOUIS]
I did what she wanted, like I always do.

01:35:14.440 --> 01:35:16.352
[WHIMPERS]

01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:30.520
Louis.

01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:46.636
Come to me.

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:49.912
What did you do, Louis?

01:35:51.680 --> 01:35:53.592
I walked backwards.

01:35:54.680 --> 01:35:56.637
She didn't have to help me this time.

01:35:57.680 --> 01:35:59.273
I counted the steps.

01:35:59.360 --> 01:36:00.430
Come with me.

01:36:01.680 --> 01:36:03.512
It was only five steps.

01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:05.069
It was easy.

01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:06.680
One...

01:36:08.920 --> 01:36:10.320
two...

01:36:11.760 --> 01:36:12.876
three...

01:36:15.520 --> 01:36:16.556
four...

01:36:17.680 --> 01:36:18.830
five.

01:36:23.120 --> 01:36:25.680
And then I thought there might be a six,

01:36:26.200 --> 01:36:28.157
but there wasn't a six.

01:36:40.720 --> 01:36:43.792
Instead of a six, I fell into the water.

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:45.559
[LOUIS AND PASCAL TOGETHER] And I died.

01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:46.836
[MONITOR BEEPS]

01:36:49.320 --> 01:36:50.674
Code blue on three!

01:36:51.960 --> 01:36:53.394
[PEREZ] Dr. Pascal, wake up.

01:36:53.560 --> 01:36:54.914
[WOMAN ON PA] Code blue in coma bay!

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:56.832
Repeat: code blue in the coma bay.

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:09.753
[PASCAL] Hundred. Are you charging?

01:37:10.360 --> 01:37:11.396
[ALARM BEEPS]

01:37:12.560 --> 01:37:13.596
Get clear.

01:37:14.360 --> 01:37:15.396
[MACY] Come on.

01:37:15.760 --> 01:37:17.752
- [JANEK] No pulse.
- Okay, 150.

01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:19.716
[ALARM BEEPS]

01:37:20.040 --> 01:37:21.190
[PASCAL] Clear.

01:37:23.080 --> 01:37:25.640
[DRAMATIC MUSIC]

01:37:25.720 --> 01:37:29.350
[NATALIE HUMMING]

01:37:31.280 --> 01:37:32.316
[PASCAL] Clear.

01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:41.916
[ALARM BEEPS]

01:37:42.720 --> 01:37:43.995
Again.

01:37:47.200 --> 01:37:49.590
- [ELECTRICITY CRACKLES]
- [LOUIS SCREAMS]

01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:52.396
Clear.

01:38:07.040 --> 01:38:08.554
[PASCAL] Yeah, we got him.

01:38:09.120 --> 01:38:10.110
Okay.

01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:52.752
[LOUIS] Pascal made the mistake
that all men make.

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:56.596
He thought that because Mommy
is so beautiful,

01:38:56.840 --> 01:38:58.354
then she must be good.

01:38:59.920 --> 01:39:01.639
But she's not good.

01:39:01.840 --> 01:39:04.230
That's why she
has to live in a hospital now,

01:39:04.320 --> 01:39:08.917
just like me, and now she has to tell
Fat Perez all of her secrets.

01:39:09.080 --> 01:39:11.037
[PEREZ] We, uh,
we put her in a private room,

01:39:11.200 --> 01:39:13.510
but she's responding very,
very well to the treatment.

01:39:14.200 --> 01:39:16.078
Misses Louis tremendously.

01:39:16.160 --> 01:39:18.675
Did you ever conclude on her diagnosis?

01:39:18.880 --> 01:39:21.714
Munchausen syndrome by proxy.

01:39:21.800 --> 01:39:24.634
Induced illness
is the correct terminology.

01:39:24.720 --> 01:39:28.316
The victim abuses another,
usually a child,

01:39:28.640 --> 01:39:31.997
in exchange for, you know,
love, attention.

01:39:32.920 --> 01:39:36.675
When Louis was small,
she had actually injured him herself.

01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:39.429
As he grew older,
he learned what she wanted,

01:39:39.520 --> 01:39:43.230
you know, responded to her needs
in exchange for love.

01:39:43.320 --> 01:39:45.630
She just had to be there, right?

01:39:47.240 --> 01:39:50.438
He'd have an accident, and she'd save him.

01:39:52.720 --> 01:39:54.393
And every time,

01:39:54.480 --> 01:39:57.154
it would strengthen the bond between them.

01:39:57.640 --> 01:39:59.472
She loved him, she hated him.

01:39:59.560 --> 01:40:02.758
Couldn't live with him,
couldn't live without him.

01:40:05.840 --> 01:40:08.594
[LOUIS] Pascal has to live
with the choice he made.

01:40:09.880 --> 01:40:11.633
Just like I did.

01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:16.473
Live with the consequences.
There are always consequences.

01:40:20.440 --> 01:40:22.955
Things work out in a funny way sometimes.

01:40:23.520 --> 01:40:27.036
Not funny "ha ha." Funny unexpected.

01:40:30.680 --> 01:40:34.515
[VIOLET] "The island of Ceylon
disappeared under our horizon

01:40:34.600 --> 01:40:36.512
during the course of the day, January..."

01:40:36.600 --> 01:40:39.274
[LOUIS] You shouldn't think,
oh, poor Louis Drax,

01:40:39.360 --> 01:40:42.273
because it doesn't suck too badly.

01:40:42.440 --> 01:40:43.920
True story.

01:40:44.440 --> 01:40:47.160
"Where on Earth
was Captain Nemo leading us?

And again, the tarnal sea is not the road

to get us back to Europe.

'Who ever said we were
going back to Europe?'

[VOICE FADING] 'What do you think
we're trying to do then?"'

01:40:57.520 --> 01:40:59.398
[LOUIS] All my life,
I've been waiting for this.

01:41:00.120 --> 01:41:03.431
Nine years. Nine is my lucky number.

01:41:03.960 --> 01:41:05.440
This is my ninth life,

01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:08.354
and my ninth life is my best one.

01:41:10.600 --> 01:41:13.035
Lots of stuff sucked before.

01:41:13.320 --> 01:41:15.915
It's not easy being a disturbed child

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:17.400
or accident-prone.

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:20.798
Mom and Dad hating each other sucked,

01:41:21.360 --> 01:41:22.396
and school sucked,

01:41:22.920 --> 01:41:25.310
and being called, Whacko Boy, sucked.

01:41:25.800 --> 01:41:28.440
Being in a coma doesn't suck, though.

01:41:30.520 --> 01:41:32.751
You don't have to worry
that Mom is fragile,

01:41:32.840 --> 01:41:36.197
and I don't have to miss my dad
more than the whole universe

01:41:36.280 --> 01:41:38.715
because he's always going to be here

01:41:38.800 --> 01:41:39.836
if I need to talk to him.

01:41:40.560 --> 01:41:42.472
[PETER] You don't have to stay.

01:41:43.200 --> 01:41:47.592
You can wake up and live if you want to.

01:41:48.520 --> 01:41:49.840
Do you want to?

01:41:49.920 --> 01:41:50.956
[LOUIS] I don't know.

01:41:51.680 --> 01:41:53.831
[PETER] It depends how curious you are

01:41:53.960 --> 01:41:55.679
about what comes next.

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:59.152
Think about the world, Louis.

01:41:59.320 --> 01:42:04.395
Think about all of its magic,
all the possibility.

01:42:04.720 --> 01:42:07.833

of going back if you're not there?
