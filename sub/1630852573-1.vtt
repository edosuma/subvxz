WEBVTT

00:55.634 --> 00:57.135
Ray Ray.

01:08.813 --> 01:11.691
I got a number on me

01:11.733 --> 01:14.319
I got a number

01:14.361 --> 01:18.240
Won't make it through
the high noon sun

01:19.866 --> 01:22.827
Well, I am my father's son

01:22.869 --> 01:25.330
And I am my father's son

01:25.372 --> 01:27.332
His bed is made

01:29.918 --> 01:32.337
And I was a hero

01:33.672 --> 01:38.885
Early in the morning
I ain't no hero

01:38.927 --> 01:40.095
In the night

01:48.019 --> 01:50.230
I am my father's son

01:53.358 --> 01:56.069
And I'll build a house
inside of you

01:56.111 --> 01:58.738
I'll go in through the mouth

01:58.780 --> 02:02.325
I'll draw three figures
on your heart

02:04.661 --> 02:07.122
One of them will be me as a boy

02:07.163 --> 02:09.833
And one of them will be me

02:09.874 --> 02:14.337
And one of them will be me
watching you run

02:14.379 --> 02:17.465
Watching you run

02:17.507 --> 02:20.218
Into the high noon sun

02:20.260 --> 02:23.096
Watching you run

02:23.138 --> 02:25.932
Farther than guns will go

02:25.974 --> 02:27.392
You are a runner

02:29.853 --> 02:31.313
With a stolen voice

02:31.354 --> 02:33.231
And you are a runner

02:36.151 --> 02:38.236
And I am my father's son

03:03.178 --> 03:06.139
I am my father's son

03:09.309 --> 03:11.895
I am my father's son

03:40.215 --> 03:42.133
Hello?

03:45.804 --> 03:48.139
Who is this?

03:48.181 --> 03:50.141
I gotta ask you something.

03:51.101 --> 03:52.852
Ray?

03:55.605 --> 03:59.109
I tell you something I did...

03:59.150 --> 04:02.362
something bad...

04:02.404 --> 04:04.072
you gotta tell the cops?

04:15.959 --> 04:18.168
Ray, where are you?

04:18.211 --> 04:19.838
Doesn't matter.

04:40.150 --> 04:41.401
I did it.

04:43.611 --> 04:45.488
What did you do?

04:48.116 --> 04:50.368
I killed my father.

05:33.161 --> 05:35.997
Shit runs downhill.

05:38.541 --> 05:40.960
Father to son.

05:41.002 --> 05:43.254
Father to daughter.

05:48.218 --> 05:50.094
What do you need, sweetheart?

05:53.139 --> 05:55.225
To not be awake.

06:01.731 --> 06:04.192
Please just leave me alone.

06:50.947 --> 06:52.282
You all right?

06:55.368 --> 06:57.912
I'm not gonna be able to do it,
Ray.

06:57.954 --> 06:59.038
Do what?

06:59.080 --> 07:02.625
You and I both know
I won't make it in prison.

07:05.628 --> 07:06.713
It's taken care of.

07:06.754 --> 07:08.506
What is?

07:08.548 --> 07:10.258
You're leaving tonight.

07:12.176 --> 07:13.136
Where?

07:13.177 --> 07:15.430
LA, for now.

07:15.471 --> 07:16.574
Lena will meet you at the gate

07:16.598 --> 07:19.058
with another ticket
and a passport.

07:23.896 --> 07:26.274
Okay, so where
the fuck am I going?

07:28.359 --> 07:30.820
Maybe it's better
if you don't know for now.

07:47.378 --> 07:51.758
Be not inhospitable
to strangers,

07:51.799 --> 07:55.178
lest they be angels in disguise.

07:55.219 --> 07:56.179
To Smitty.

07:56.220 --> 07:57.430
To Smitty.

09:23.766 --> 09:25.518
You got old, huh?

09:25.560 --> 09:28.479
You owe me 80 bucks.

09:28.521 --> 09:29.814
What for?

09:29.856 --> 09:31.816
- My Cutlass.
- What?

09:31.858 --> 09:35.903
You double-parked my Cutlass
in front of the Stop & Shop.

09:36.696 --> 09:38.406
I don't recall, Matty.

09:38.448 --> 09:39.449
I didn't, neither,

09:39.490 --> 09:41.617
till I got pulled over
two years later.

09:41.659 --> 09:44.537
$20 ticket times four.

09:44.579 --> 09:48.207
Oh. Okay, yeah.

09:49.333 --> 09:50.960
Here.

09:51.002 --> 09:54.839
Here's 53.
You know I'm good for the 27.

09:54.881 --> 09:59.051
I know what you're good for,
Mick, and it ain't money.

09:59.093 --> 10:02.138
That's where you're wrong,
Matty.

10:02.180 --> 10:03.806
Look here.

10:14.150 --> 10:16.027
The fuck is that?

10:16.068 --> 10:19.322
Something for your ex-wives
to fight over.

10:27.663 --> 10:30.750
How much you looking for here?

10:30.792 --> 10:34.128
Jim's son Kevin
was gonna give me 20 mil.

10:34.170 --> 10:36.339
We were right
in the middle of the draw.

10:36.380 --> 10:37.340
Yeah?

10:37.381 --> 10:39.801
And then we hit
that little snag.

10:39.842 --> 10:41.636
And what was that?

10:41.677 --> 10:45.264
I think you must've heard,
Matty.

10:45.306 --> 10:47.141
Heard what?

10:49.310 --> 10:51.395
Declan got shot.

10:53.606 --> 10:56.025
So who shot Declan?

10:57.401 --> 10:59.070
Your son?

11:04.408 --> 11:06.202
Yeah.

11:06.244 --> 11:08.496
Which one?

11:08.538 --> 11:10.122
Daryll.

11:10.164 --> 11:11.624
The Black one?

11:11.666 --> 11:13.459
Right.

11:14.794 --> 11:17.547
Why the fuck would he do that?

11:17.588 --> 11:20.383
Crime of passion, Matty.

11:20.424 --> 11:21.467
Declan killed his girl.

11:21.509 --> 11:22.611
You can't hold a man accountable

11:22.635 --> 11:24.395
for getting vengeance over love.

11:26.097 --> 11:28.766
Well, Jim Sullivan
won't see it that way.

11:30.810 --> 11:32.019
You wanna move those papers,

11:32.061 --> 11:35.648
you're gonna have to go through
Declan's people to do it.

11:35.690 --> 11:39.819
I got no problem with that.
Do you?

11:39.861 --> 11:42.196
You don't think
they'd be loyal to Declan?

11:42.238 --> 11:45.700
I'm thinking it's paper
worth 20 mil.

11:45.741 --> 11:48.870
At that number,
no one's fucking loyal.

11:55.710 --> 11:59.213
Grandpa Michael
wasn't a mobster.

11:59.255 --> 12:00.172
Sure he was.

12:00.214 --> 12:03.551
No, he was just
a mean son of a bitch.

12:03.593 --> 12:05.803
Oh, come on. He was in the mob.

12:05.845 --> 12:07.388
- He wasn't.
- He was.

12:07.430 --> 12:10.016
He wasn't. Sorry, Bunch.

12:10.057 --> 12:12.435
He used to work the door
at Rose's hotel.

12:12.476 --> 12:13.561
Mm-hmm.

12:13.603 --> 12:14.645
Wow.

12:14.687 --> 12:16.522
I remember that fucking place.

12:16.564 --> 12:18.608
No, you don't.
You was too young.

12:18.649 --> 12:20.526
Yeah, actually I do.

12:21.652 --> 12:24.322
Mom, she used to drop
me and Bridge off there

12:24.363 --> 12:25.615
when she had shit to do.

12:25.656 --> 12:28.117
We'd sit at the bar

12:28.159 --> 12:33.456
and drink cokes
with the cocktail waitresses.

12:33.497 --> 12:34.332
Waitresses?

12:34.373 --> 12:38.544
Oh, and they fucking played gin
all day long.

12:38.586 --> 12:39.980
I mean, they taught us.

12:40.004 --> 12:41.440
I remember there was...
There was...

12:41.464 --> 12:42.673
There were two Black ones,

12:42.715 --> 12:46.719
and there were two white ones
and they were obese.

12:49.263 --> 12:50.056
But fuck it.

12:50.097 --> 12:52.642
They were nice
cocktail waitresses.

12:52.683 --> 12:54.286
They weren't
cocktail waitresses, Bunch.

12:54.310 --> 12:56.771
Yeah, and that hotel,
it wasn't no hotel.

12:56.812 --> 12:57.980
No.

13:01.943 --> 13:03.361
It was a fuckin' whorehouse?

13:05.196 --> 13:07.406
Proud descendants
of whoremongers

13:07.448 --> 13:08.699
on your grandmother's side.

13:08.741 --> 13:09.825
Did you know that, Daryll?

13:09.867 --> 13:12.203
You're two generations away
from being a pimp.

13:12.244 --> 13:13.329
Two? One.

13:13.371 --> 13:15.873
Yeah, he was a pimp.

13:15.915 --> 13:18.501
It all makes sense, though,
when you think about it.

13:18.542 --> 13:20.461
What?

13:20.503 --> 13:23.881
I mean, raised in a whorehouse?

13:23.923 --> 13:26.133
Beat every day?

13:26.175 --> 13:29.637
It's probably the reason
Mickey is the way that he is.

13:35.810 --> 13:37.395
Dancing.

13:37.436 --> 13:38.187
What?

13:38.229 --> 13:40.189
That's what he should've done.

13:40.231 --> 13:42.650
Mick should've been an
instructor at Arthur Murray.

13:42.692 --> 13:46.112
Ballroom shit?
He'd be good at that.

13:46.153 --> 13:50.408
With the leather pants
and a disco ball buckle on it?

13:51.534 --> 13:54.036
Cheatin' old ladies
outta their husbands' money.

13:54.078 --> 13:55.830
Yeah. Hey, hey.

13:57.123 --> 14:00.918
Don't worry, darling.
'Cause it's all in the hips.

14:00.960 --> 14:05.506
Oh, you fucking call that hips?
Give me a break.

14:05.548 --> 14:07.341
Oh, hey, hey, it's electric.

14:07.383 --> 14:09.010
No, it's not.

14:09.051 --> 14:11.846
It's fucking pornographic.

14:11.887 --> 14:14.098
Take it back!

14:14.140 --> 14:16.100
Oh!

14:16.142 --> 14:18.978
- And up!
- Oh!

14:22.106 --> 14:23.315
Bring it back now.

14:23.357 --> 14:27.319
Take it back,
take it back, take it back. Oh!

14:27.361 --> 14:28.612
And hey!

14:32.950 --> 14:34.952
You're up.

14:34.994 --> 14:37.079
What are you doing?

14:37.955 --> 14:40.499
Nothing. We were just...

14:40.541 --> 14:41.459
No, I know. I'm sorry.

14:41.500 --> 14:42.376
I know what you're doing.

14:42.418 --> 14:45.504
I'm just, um,
trying to figure out why.

14:46.589 --> 14:47.339
Bridge.

14:47.381 --> 14:50.426
We didn't mean
anything by it, Bridge.

14:56.724 --> 14:59.685
Why is it so easy
for you to forget?

14:59.977 --> 15:02.271
Forget what, sweetheart?

15:02.938 --> 15:05.357
Someone's life.

15:06.984 --> 15:09.820
To just...

15:09.862 --> 15:11.947
drink it all away
as if someone's life

15:11.989 --> 15:15.409
is just another bullshit story
to tell.

15:18.120 --> 15:20.790
Another notch in Mickey's belt.

15:22.458 --> 15:25.086
Along with...
With all the other stories,

15:25.127 --> 15:27.088
all the...

15:27.129 --> 15:28.964
whores and killers and thieves

15:29.006 --> 15:31.467
that you're so fucking proud of.

15:38.808 --> 15:42.770
That is what Mickey did to you.

15:46.774 --> 15:48.192
All of you.

15:53.239 --> 15:56.450
That's what makes you so alike.

15:59.036 --> 16:01.080
He taught you how to forget.

16:01.122 --> 16:04.166
Soft dramatic music

17:13.068 --> 17:14.236
Hey.

17:14.278 --> 17:16.696
Were there many people
at the funeral?

17:17.906 --> 17:18.949
Just us.

17:22.203 --> 17:26.290
We're postponing Declan's
till we find my father.

17:31.754 --> 17:34.298
Ray, you there?

17:34.340 --> 17:36.008
You home?

17:36.050 --> 17:37.384
Yeah.

17:39.845 --> 17:41.138
I'll be right over.

17:59.782 --> 18:01.617
Everything is such a mess.

18:07.581 --> 18:09.625
There's something
I gotta tell you.

18:15.839 --> 18:16.924
What?

18:20.010 --> 18:21.887
About your father.

18:28.185 --> 18:29.603
What is it, Ray?

18:44.868 --> 18:47.913
He's gone, isn't he?

18:47.955 --> 18:49.707
My father's gone.

18:59.800 --> 19:01.468
We did everything Mickey said.

19:01.510 --> 19:05.973
We gave him everything
that he wanted.

19:06.015 --> 19:07.975
I'll get you the papers back.

19:16.567 --> 19:19.987
I don't... I don't care
about the fucking money, Ray.

19:34.793 --> 19:36.128
Are you coming?

19:39.256 --> 19:41.842
She would've been better
off if she never met me.

19:42.760 --> 19:44.845
What does that mean, Ray?

19:49.016 --> 19:52.311
I got what I had coming.

19:52.353 --> 19:55.731
What did you have coming?

20:38.690 --> 20:40.192
Ray Ray.

20:44.113 --> 20:47.449
Fish gotta swim,
birds gotta fly.

21:13.434 --> 21:15.352
Everybody's looking at you.

21:15.394 --> 21:17.154
They're thinking
you ain't got balls.

21:17.187 --> 21:19.356
That what you want 'em to think?

21:24.319 --> 21:29.074
Ray Ray, trust me, all right?
I'll catch ya.

21:29.116 --> 21:31.118
Come on, kid. Trust me.

23:52.467 --> 23:56.138
There is a time for everything.

23:56.179 --> 23:59.182
A time to be born.

23:59.224 --> 24:03.687
A time to die. A time to plant.

24:05.772 --> 24:07.482
And a time to pluck up

24:07.524 --> 24:09.651
the thing that has been planted.

24:15.032 --> 24:16.867
Body of Christ.

24:19.536 --> 24:21.204
Body of Christ.

24:25.334 --> 24:26.543
Body of Christ.

24:26.585 --> 24:28.003
Amen.

24:38.639 --> 24:40.349
Body of Christ.

25:46.123 --> 25:47.749
Who the fuck are you?

25:48.458 --> 25:50.252
My name's Ray Donovan.

25:51.545 --> 25:53.213
Mick's son?

25:53.255 --> 25:54.840
Yeah.

25:54.881 --> 25:56.550
The one who moved out West?

25:56.591 --> 25:59.010
To become an agent or something?

25:59.803 --> 26:00.762
Someone told me you were

26:00.804 --> 26:02.532
banging that broad
from the movies.

26:02.556 --> 26:03.849
The one from the cult show.

26:03.890 --> 26:06.184
What's her name with the big...

26:06.226 --> 26:07.936
You heard from my father?

26:08.562 --> 26:10.439
Mick?

26:12.566 --> 26:14.526
Not in 15 years.

26:15.610 --> 26:17.779
Why, did you lose him
or something?

26:33.378 --> 26:35.589
What's that for?

26:35.630 --> 26:37.299
If you see him.

27:33.897 --> 27:37.317
Stay strong, stay strong.

27:45.033 --> 27:47.077
We all loved her, Raymond.

27:50.705 --> 27:52.666
I've been transferred
to another diocese

27:52.707 --> 27:54.417
in Pennsylvania.

27:56.670 --> 27:59.005
I'm so sorry to be leaving.

28:00.799 --> 28:04.219
I'm gonna miss you and the boys.

28:07.806 --> 28:11.893
You have been an angel
to this family, Raymond.

28:17.649 --> 28:19.901
I hope you know that.

28:20.527 --> 28:22.404
To all of us.

28:48.305 --> 28:51.266
- You're fucking late.
- For what?

28:52.225 --> 28:53.935
That shitshow?

28:53.977 --> 28:55.246
You think I'm gonna sit in there

28:55.270 --> 28:58.523
and watch that cocksucker
desecrate my daughter's body?

29:00.066 --> 29:02.319
At least he was there.

29:15.916 --> 29:19.169
She was my baby, Raymond.

29:19.210 --> 29:20.897
That fucking fairy's
got no business

29:20.921 --> 29:22.964
going anywhere near my babies.

29:24.549 --> 29:26.968
Never seemed
to bother you before.

29:28.303 --> 29:32.599
You're a piece of shit, Mick.
You always have been.

29:44.152 --> 29:46.446
What do you want, boy? Huh?

29:50.825 --> 29:52.619
I should've killed him then.

29:56.581 --> 29:58.333
And then what?

30:01.419 --> 30:03.213
I don't know.

30:03.254 --> 30:06.091
Maybe none of this
would've happened.

30:06.132 --> 30:07.276
You're probably right.

30:07.300 --> 30:09.052
None of it would have happened.

30:09.719 --> 30:11.930
No wife,

30:11.972 --> 30:15.225
no kids,

30:15.266 --> 30:16.434
no life.

30:17.686 --> 30:20.230
Probably better
for everyone if I had.

30:22.023 --> 30:24.567
That's some sacrifice, Ray.

30:27.779 --> 30:30.782
You'd be willing to give up
all those years...

30:33.576 --> 30:36.454
all that life...

30:37.956 --> 30:40.417
just for him?

31:29.257 --> 31:30.592
What can I get you?

31:30.633 --> 31:33.094
Whiskey, please. Neat.

31:35.513 --> 31:37.724
Was that Matty Gleeson
who just walked out of here?

31:37.766 --> 31:38.725
What?

31:38.767 --> 31:40.327
Am I fucking Facebook
all of a sudden?

31:42.687 --> 31:44.773
Am I asking the wrong guy?

32:00.747 --> 32:03.208
Was my makeup running
or something?

32:05.960 --> 32:07.837
No. Sorry.

32:10.757 --> 32:14.803
I'm Evelynne. What's your name?

32:14.844 --> 32:16.012
Ray.

32:16.054 --> 32:18.640
Well, you look like you had
a rough day, Ray.

32:19.682 --> 32:20.767
Yeah?

32:21.643 --> 32:23.144
You mind?

32:24.062 --> 32:25.688
Sure.

32:41.746 --> 32:44.999
My day was a fuckin' doozy.
Pfft.

32:45.041 --> 32:47.502
A real four-star shitshow.

32:47.544 --> 32:48.419
Yeah?

32:48.461 --> 32:50.463
Work over at the Gap.
Manager now, you know?

32:50.505 --> 32:54.092
It's all right.
The benefits don't suck.

32:54.134 --> 32:55.260
Keeps the rent paid.

32:55.301 --> 32:57.804
And I get 40 percent off
the clothes, which, you know.

32:58.555 --> 32:59.764
But today, it was like

32:59.806 --> 33:01.492
the fucking running
of the bulls.

33:01.516 --> 33:04.769
This whole busload
full of Japanese tourists.

33:05.353 --> 33:06.497
You'd think they'd never seen

33:06.521 --> 33:08.374
a pair of flat-front khakis
before.

33:08.398 --> 33:09.708
I mean, what the hell
do you think we are?

33:09.732 --> 33:12.694
What did you say your name was?

33:12.735 --> 33:14.320
I didn't.

33:14.362 --> 33:17.448
Well, whoever you are,
finish your drink.

33:18.074 --> 33:19.450
We're closing.

33:25.707 --> 33:27.625
For the bottle.

33:27.667 --> 33:28.686
Nice to meet you, Evelynne.

33:28.710 --> 33:29.711
Yeah.

33:29.752 --> 33:32.422
Coulda sworn
we had it all worked out

33:32.463 --> 33:35.800
Bryan Adams' "Cuts Like A Knife"

33:37.010 --> 33:39.345
You had this boy believin'

33:39.387 --> 33:42.849
Way beyond the shadow of a doubt

33:45.560 --> 33:46.477
Yeah

33:46.519 --> 33:49.105
Well, I heard it on the street

33:49.147 --> 33:51.608
I heard you might've
found somebody new

33:51.649 --> 33:53.234
Come on, dance with me.

33:53.276 --> 33:55.820
Dance with your girlfriend.

33:55.862 --> 33:57.071
Come on, Ray.

33:57.113 --> 33:59.365
Well, who is he, baby?

33:59.407 --> 34:02.869
Who is he and tell me
what he means to you

34:04.913 --> 34:06.915
Oh, yeah

34:06.956 --> 34:09.208
Took it all for granted

34:09.250 --> 34:13.963
But how was I to know
that you'd be letting go

34:14.005 --> 34:15.340
Hey. Ray.

34:15.380 --> 34:17.175
Ray? Come on. Look at me.

34:17.217 --> 34:21.429
Look at me, baby. Look at me.

34:21.471 --> 34:23.514
But it feels so right

34:23.556 --> 34:25.891
You all right?

34:25.934 --> 34:26.809
Yeah.

34:26.851 --> 34:28.186
It cuts like a knife

34:30.271 --> 34:32.774
Oh, but it feels so right

34:37.904 --> 34:40.114
I'll be right back.

34:40.156 --> 34:42.033
I'm gonna use the girls' room.

34:43.743 --> 34:44.994
Ooh, yeah

34:46.536 --> 34:49.248
So wait a minute, darlin'

34:49.290 --> 34:52.710
Can't you see we did
the best we could

34:52.752 --> 34:54.920
Ooh, yeah

34:56.505 --> 34:59.509
This wouldn't be the first time

34:59.550 --> 35:00.802
Things have gone astray

35:00.843 --> 35:02.303
Hey, how you guys doing?

35:16.025 --> 35:17.819
Bridget was good people.

35:18.361 --> 35:22.031
Wore her heart on her sleeve.
Never a bad word about anyone.

35:22.073 --> 35:23.658
Never.

35:24.951 --> 35:26.536
She loved you.

35:27.870 --> 35:29.580
She was proud of you.

35:33.042 --> 35:36.629
Hey.

35:36.671 --> 35:38.673
She was.

35:41.592 --> 35:42.802
Sláinte.

35:43.928 --> 35:45.096
Sláinte.

35:45.138 --> 35:47.015
You look like shit, by the way.

35:51.311 --> 35:52.228
Can I ask you something?

35:52.270 --> 35:53.563
Sure.

35:54.605 --> 35:55.273
Colleen?

35:55.315 --> 35:57.608
What about her?

35:57.650 --> 35:59.110
Why?

35:59.152 --> 36:00.611
Why?

36:01.237 --> 36:03.114
She's a whore.

36:03.573 --> 36:05.616
A fucking coke fiend
and a half-wit.

36:05.658 --> 36:06.909
So why?

36:11.039 --> 36:13.458
Seriously. Why?

36:14.751 --> 36:16.127
I don't know, Abby.

36:17.170 --> 36:18.087
You don't know?

36:18.129 --> 36:19.672
I don't know.

36:23.217 --> 36:25.595
It's honest, at least.
It's honest.

36:33.311 --> 36:34.705
You know what happens
if my father finds out

36:34.729 --> 36:37.023
he's dealing coke
in the bathroom, right?

36:38.983 --> 36:42.028
Oh, cuts like a knife

36:47.700 --> 36:50.161
I mean, he's a romantic,
your father.

36:50.203 --> 36:52.955
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

36:53.498 --> 36:55.875
Come on, let's get
the fuck out of here.

36:56.250 --> 36:59.712
He may be a cocksucker, Ray,
but he sure loves being alive.

37:03.341 --> 37:05.051
Do you?

37:06.928 --> 37:08.137
"Do you?"

37:08.179 --> 37:10.306
That's what she said?

37:11.682 --> 37:13.643
Yeah.

37:13.684 --> 37:16.437
What do you think she meant
by that?

37:18.481 --> 37:20.233
I don't know.

37:24.070 --> 37:25.279
She let him in.

37:27.323 --> 37:28.908
Let who in?

37:35.373 --> 37:37.583
Calabasas.

37:37.625 --> 37:40.044
I thought that if we could get
away, we'd be all right.

37:40.086 --> 37:41.254
But...

37:44.048 --> 37:46.551
She let the wolf in.

37:46.592 --> 37:48.803
Opened the fucking door for him.

37:50.847 --> 37:53.516
Who's the wolf, Ray?

38:58.498 --> 39:00.291
Ray?

39:00.333 --> 39:02.043
How is she?

39:03.878 --> 39:05.087
How's who?

39:05.129 --> 39:07.673
Bridge.

39:07.715 --> 39:10.134
She's asleep.

39:10.176 --> 39:11.260
She okay?

39:11.302 --> 39:12.929
Yeah, she's okay.

39:12.970 --> 39:14.138
Good.

39:14.180 --> 39:15.223
Where are you?

39:15.264 --> 39:16.724
Boston.

39:16.766 --> 39:19.769
Fuck you doing in Boston?

39:21.229 --> 39:24.774
Don't worry about it.
Go back to sleep, Bunch.

39:34.367 --> 39:36.202
Look at this fucking guy.

39:36.244 --> 39:37.888
Come on, Arty.

39:37.912 --> 39:40.623
These fucking twinkletoes.
Look at him.

39:44.919 --> 39:48.005
Hey, all right, fellas.
Hey, it's nice to see you.

39:49.507 --> 39:51.592
- All right, all right.
- Let's go.

39:52.009 --> 39:53.487
All right,
I'm coming, I'm coming. Jesus.

39:53.511 --> 39:54.428
Oh, fuck.

39:54.470 --> 39:57.014
Paint the street fuckin' red.

40:01.644 --> 40:04.188
Hey, what the fuck
is this about?

40:04.230 --> 40:05.290
I was just coming to see you.

40:05.314 --> 40:06.708
You've been a busy fucking boy,
Mick.

40:06.732 --> 40:08.442
What the fuck you talking about?

40:08.484 --> 40:09.610
I'm talking about

40:09.652 --> 40:11.213
the 50 French blenders you stole

40:11.237 --> 40:13.531
from the back of Sam's truck.

40:13.573 --> 40:15.199
Oh, the Cuisinarts?

40:15.241 --> 40:17.326
Yes, the fucking Cuisinarts.

40:17.368 --> 40:20.538
When you gonna get it through
your thick fucking skull

40:20.580 --> 40:22.665
these guys are not
to mess with, huh?

40:22.707 --> 40:24.417
Oh, Jesus Christ.

40:24.458 --> 40:26.794
That's what you're upset about?

40:35.928 --> 40:37.054
Hey, Jim.

40:37.096 --> 40:42.059
Jim, I need you to, uh,
just do me a favor.

40:42.101 --> 40:45.354
Broaden your fuckin' horizons
for a minute.

40:50.484 --> 40:51.902
What?

40:52.820 --> 40:54.447
All right. All right.

40:54.488 --> 40:56.300
I need to talk to you
for a second, Jim.

40:56.324 --> 40:58.326
Oh, fuck.

41:01.162 --> 41:03.581
Hey Ray Ray. How are the boys?

41:03.623 --> 41:08.169
Jim, sit down. Jesus.

41:12.131 --> 41:13.716
All right.

41:14.675 --> 41:18.220
So the other day, um,

41:18.262 --> 41:21.098
I'm sitting there
in the Taco Grande

41:21.140 --> 41:22.725
and minding my own business

41:22.767 --> 41:25.478
eating my chimichanga
in the corner.

41:25.519 --> 41:28.272
And who do you think
walks in the front door?

41:29.899 --> 41:32.652
What the fuck
are you talking about?

41:32.693 --> 41:35.780
- Ezra Goldman.
- Who?

41:35.821 --> 41:37.365
Ezra fucking... I don't know.

41:37.406 --> 41:39.176
Some Hollywood Jew.
It's not important.

41:39.200 --> 41:40.576
What is important

41:40.618 --> 41:44.038
is that they are shooting
a movie right here in Southie.

41:44.080 --> 41:44.914
So?

41:44.955 --> 41:48.834
So what the fuck
do they know about Southie?

41:48.876 --> 41:50.562
I'm talking to this guy
for ten minutes

41:50.586 --> 41:51.712
and already he hires me on

41:51.754 --> 41:55.508
as Sean Walker's personal
technical consultant.

41:55.549 --> 41:56.592
Who?

41:56.634 --> 41:57.778
- Sean Walker.
- Yeah.

41:57.802 --> 42:00.155
- The movie star Sean Walker.
- Movie star Sean Walker.

42:00.179 --> 42:03.015
Supposed to be some kind of
vigilante priest or something.

42:03.057 --> 42:05.851
Yeah. Black Mass,
they're calling it.

42:05.893 --> 42:09.313
Huh? And I'm telling you,
these guys are loaded, Jimmy.

42:09.355 --> 42:11.315
A major motion picture here.

42:11.357 --> 42:12.817
Trucks up and down E Street

42:12.858 --> 42:15.695
loaded with expensive equipment
and no fucking security.

42:16.737 --> 42:18.864
Oh, come on.
Camera, lights, you know,

42:18.906 --> 42:20.366
trailers, these guys even carry

42:20.408 --> 42:22.910
their own
fucking kitchens around.

42:24.745 --> 42:27.415
You wanna make a play
for a hit on 'em, huh?

42:27.456 --> 42:30.418
Well, I talk to this Ezra guy,

42:30.459 --> 42:33.546
he, uh, brings the security
contracts to you.

42:33.587 --> 42:36.966
Boom shakalaka,
you catch my drift?

42:37.007 --> 42:39.844
And, uh, what do you think, Jim?

42:39.885 --> 42:42.388
Ray here would make
a hell of a bodyguard.

42:42.430 --> 42:45.474
Might even put in a word
with Sean Walker himself.

42:48.769 --> 42:51.814
Ray, you know anything about
these movie trucks coming in?

42:53.107 --> 42:56.152
I saw a couple of trucks
over on E Street.

43:01.449 --> 43:03.200
How many trucks
we talking about?

43:03.242 --> 43:06.245
Soft dramatic music

43:17.381 --> 43:20.426
Oh, come on Teresa.
Don't do that.

43:23.888 --> 43:27.266
I just want to talk
to my daughter, all right?

43:29.393 --> 43:31.562
Please.

43:32.688 --> 43:35.357
I'm not drunk.

43:37.485 --> 43:40.863
I'm lonely, and I miss her.

43:43.949 --> 43:47.828
When my mother died,
my Aunt Rose told us

43:47.870 --> 43:51.499
we had to stay up all night
watching the body.

43:52.666 --> 43:54.436
And when I asked her why,
she said,

43:54.460 --> 43:57.713
"Well, that's what wakes
are for."

43:57.755 --> 43:59.840
To watch the body.

43:59.882 --> 44:02.343
"To make sure
they don't wake up."

44:06.138 --> 44:10.142
We were terrified that she'd
start twitching at any moment.

44:12.603 --> 44:16.857
But also half hoping
that she would wake up again.

44:20.736 --> 44:24.198
Rose went downstairs
and starting cooking stew.

44:26.200 --> 44:28.035
Oh, the smell.

44:29.078 --> 44:30.722
The whole neighborhood
must have smelled that stew

44:30.746 --> 44:34.250
because by four in the morning,
we had a full house.

44:34.625 --> 44:35.876
And everyone brought something.

44:35.918 --> 44:39.338
Booze, a bag, box of something.

44:39.380 --> 44:41.298
Cakes, cookies.

44:42.591 --> 44:44.468
I came downstairs
and everyone was there

44:44.510 --> 44:47.179
sharing stories about my mom.

44:51.976 --> 44:55.145
I never knew
I had so much family.

45:04.947 --> 45:07.533
But you were right,
what you said about us.

45:09.410 --> 45:11.161
That we forget.

45:13.205 --> 45:17.918
There's a difference
between drinking to forget

45:17.960 --> 45:22.006
and remembering someone the way
they ought to be remembered.

45:27.553 --> 45:30.556
Poignant music

45:50.868 --> 45:53.787
Ray.

45:53.829 --> 45:54.997
Ray... Raymond.

45:55.039 --> 45:56.582
He's not here.

45:58.334 --> 46:00.711
Where'd he go?

46:00.753 --> 46:02.755
Boston.

46:02.796 --> 46:03.839
What?

46:03.881 --> 46:06.592
He went to Boston.

46:06.634 --> 46:08.010
When?

46:08.052 --> 46:10.971
I don't know. Last night.

46:11.013 --> 46:13.724
He called me,
that's where he told me he was.

46:19.939 --> 46:22.900
Raymond, it's your brother.

46:22.942 --> 46:25.194
What the fuck are you doing
in Boston?

46:25.235 --> 46:27.363
Mickey.

46:27.404 --> 46:29.156
What?

46:29.198 --> 46:32.743
Mickey's in Boston.
He's got those fucking papers.

46:32.785 --> 46:35.120
That's probably why
Ray went up there.

46:36.121 --> 46:39.416
No, he's not going up there
for that.

46:39.458 --> 46:42.252
Do you know much
those things are fucking worth?

46:42.294 --> 46:43.128
No.

46:43.170 --> 46:45.422
He's not going up there
for the money, Bunch.

46:47.132 --> 46:49.176
He's gonna kill Mickey.

46:49.218 --> 46:51.053
You gotta go up there.

46:51.095 --> 46:52.513
Right fucking now.

46:52.554 --> 46:53.806
Oh, let me just call.

46:53.847 --> 46:55.033
No, he's not answering.

46:55.057 --> 46:57.643
You don't go, then I gotta go.

46:57.685 --> 47:00.980
All right, all right, calm down.

47:01.021 --> 47:04.733
My dad's in Boston? Why?

47:04.775 --> 47:06.235
We don't know, Bridge.

47:06.276 --> 47:08.046
Bunch is going up there
to find out.

47:10.906 --> 47:12.116
I'm going with you.

47:12.157 --> 47:14.451
No, Bridge,
that's not a good idea.

47:14.493 --> 47:15.577
I'm coming.

47:15.619 --> 47:17.788
No, sweetheart. It's not safe.

47:20.082 --> 47:21.750
I don't care.

49:56.780 --> 49:58.240
Where the fuck you going?

49:59.199 --> 50:02.411
Get up, you piece of shit.

50:02.452 --> 50:03.287
Ray?

50:03.328 --> 50:04.872
Get in the fucking car!

50:05.873 --> 50:07.749
Get in the fucking car!

50:07.791 --> 50:10.043
- Come on!
- I'm getting in.

50:10.085 --> 50:11.628
- Get in!
- I'm in. I'm in.

50:11.670 --> 50:13.338
Stand him up.

50:14.673 --> 50:15.716
Hey!

50:16.466 --> 50:19.553
Move! Move!
Get out of the fucking way!

50:20.053 --> 50:21.930
Fuck!

50:24.933 --> 50:28.103
Tense music

50:33.609 --> 50:34.651
Matty, you fuck.

50:40.240 --> 50:41.950
Fuck.

50:41.992 --> 50:43.952
- Hey.
- Fuck.

50:49.917 --> 50:51.752
Raymond.

50:53.086 --> 50:54.087
Oh, shit.

51:04.056 --> 51:05.349
Son of a bitch.

51:09.102 --> 51:10.604
No, no!

52:34.146 --> 52:36.523
You want some gum or something?

52:39.401 --> 52:42.237
Oh, hey, you can hook
my phone up to the Bluetooth.

52:42.279 --> 52:43.905
Is this Mickey?

52:47.242 --> 52:49.286
It's his briefcase.

52:49.328 --> 52:51.663
What's in his briefcase?

52:54.041 --> 52:56.126
Papers.

52:56.168 --> 52:57.836
What papers?

53:02.424 --> 53:05.385
Stocks he wants to trade
for money.

53:07.846 --> 53:12.642
If he hasn't traded it already
for coke and whores, you know.

53:19.983 --> 53:22.486
Do you think
some people are just bad?

53:35.165 --> 53:36.792
Yeah, I do.

53:47.803 --> 53:49.513
Coke and whores.

53:58.146 --> 53:59.165
What do you want?

53:59.189 --> 54:00.899
Hey Kev, it's Mick.

54:00.941 --> 54:05.737
Yeah, that was some kind of
fuckup we got caught in, huh?

54:06.196 --> 54:08.782
You know, it had nothing
to do with you and me.

54:08.824 --> 54:11.118
No?

54:11.159 --> 54:13.495
I mean,
Daryll was out for blood.

54:13.537 --> 54:14.764
Shit between him
and your brother.

54:14.788 --> 54:17.707
We just got caught,
wrong place wrong time, right?

54:18.333 --> 54:19.960
Fuck you.

54:21.211 --> 54:23.338
Still want those papers?

54:23.380 --> 54:25.632
You're out of your mind.

54:25.674 --> 54:29.052
I'm having a fire sale,
if you're interested.

54:29.094 --> 54:33.723
75 percent off, today only.

54:35.559 --> 54:37.060
Where are you?

54:37.102 --> 54:38.854
Boston.

54:43.108 --> 54:44.901
Was that Mickey Donovan?

54:47.112 --> 54:48.780
What does he want?

54:49.448 --> 54:51.992
He wants to sell us
our money back.

55:57.474 --> 55:58.600
Fuck.

56:19.120 --> 56:20.413
Dad?

56:20.455 --> 56:22.666
- Bridge?
- Where are you?

56:22.707 --> 56:26.169
Boston. I need to talk to Bunch.

56:26.211 --> 56:27.754
Are you okay?

56:27.796 --> 56:29.673
I'm fine, sweetheart.
Where's Bunch?

56:30.924 --> 56:32.676
Did you do it?

56:32.717 --> 56:34.678
Did I do what?

56:37.305 --> 56:38.932
Kill Mickey.

56:42.018 --> 56:43.770
No.

56:44.229 --> 56:46.273
Tell Bunch to call me,
all right?

56:46.690 --> 56:48.942
Tell him I need him
to come get me.

58:11.316 --> 58:13.276
Hold traffic!

58:15.695 --> 58:17.447
Pictures up!

58:18.073 --> 58:19.240
We're rolling, guys.

58:19.282 --> 58:20.950
Roll sound!

58:23.495 --> 58:25.205
Action!

58:31.419 --> 58:34.214
This is... this is bullshit.

58:34.255 --> 58:35.924
Cut!

58:36.424 --> 58:38.176
Cut! Cut!

58:44.057 --> 58:46.393
So you just
want me to walk up to him,

58:46.434 --> 58:49.229
shoot him in the back,
and then walk away?

58:49.270 --> 58:51.523
Yes, Sean, yes.

58:51.564 --> 58:53.167
You reach into your robe
like so.

58:53.191 --> 58:55.527
Just as you approach,
you shoot him in the back.

58:55.568 --> 58:57.380
Then you put the gun
back into your robe

58:57.404 --> 58:58.798
and you simply continue
down the street

58:58.822 --> 59:01.241
as if nothing
at all had transpired.

59:04.703 --> 59:06.955
That ain't how it works.

59:06.996 --> 59:08.456
No?

59:08.498 --> 59:10.375
Shoot a guy in the back?

59:10.417 --> 59:13.503
That's, uh, a warning.

59:13.545 --> 59:15.690
You wanna make him dead,
you gotta put two in the head.

59:15.714 --> 59:16.756
That's what I thought.

59:16.798 --> 59:18.025
Not even a stupid fucking priest

59:18.049 --> 59:19.402
is just gonna
walk down the street

59:19.426 --> 59:21.928
and pull out a gun
where anyone can see.

59:22.637 --> 59:24.389
Sean, we have worked this out

59:24.431 --> 59:25.825
and it will be best
if the blocking...

59:25.849 --> 59:28.017
I want to hear
what he has to say.

59:31.646 --> 59:33.273
Show me.

59:37.026 --> 59:38.278
All right.

59:40.155 --> 59:41.364
Uh...

59:42.907 --> 59:44.325
- Hey.
- Don't worry.

59:44.367 --> 59:45.744
You'll get it back.

59:45.785 --> 59:47.996
Come on, give me the gun.

59:49.914 --> 59:52.584
Jesus.

59:52.625 --> 59:54.002
It's rubber!

59:55.879 --> 59:59.048
Fuck. It looks real.

59:59.090 --> 01:00:01.885
I'll be you.

01:00:01.926 --> 01:00:04.387
Come on. You know what to do.

01:00:06.556 --> 01:00:08.516
All right. Great.

01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:13.813
Action.

01:00:18.777 --> 01:00:21.321
Pow! Pow!

01:00:21.362 --> 01:00:22.405
Second one in the head.

01:00:24.657 --> 01:00:27.494
Everybody's looking at the car.

01:00:27.535 --> 01:00:29.162
No one's the wiser.

01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:33.500
That's what I was talking about.

01:00:57.398 --> 01:00:58.691
Hello?

01:00:58.733 --> 01:01:03.530
Bridget took my car, my phone,

01:01:03.571 --> 01:01:05.031
and my gun.

01:01:05.073 --> 01:01:05.990
What?

01:01:06.032 --> 01:01:08.219
We were on our way
to come get you.

01:01:08.243 --> 01:01:09.035
What for?

01:01:09.077 --> 01:01:11.621
To keep you out of prison,
that's what for.

01:01:11.663 --> 01:01:14.207
Why the fuck
would you bring Bridge?

01:01:14.249 --> 01:01:15.083
She didn't really give me

01:01:15.124 --> 01:01:17.418
a fucking option, Ray,
all right?

01:01:17.460 --> 01:01:18.854
Look, we're both
worried about you.

01:01:18.878 --> 01:01:20.713
What was... what was I gonna say?

01:01:20.755 --> 01:01:25.176
All right. All right.
Where are you?

01:01:25.218 --> 01:01:27.720
Boston.

01:01:27.762 --> 01:01:31.891
I need you to get my car.
It's at South Station.

01:01:31.933 --> 01:01:33.059
Keys in the console.

01:01:33.101 --> 01:01:35.562
And come to the Gardner Motel,
room 46, all right?

01:01:49.325 --> 01:01:50.201
People who forget.

01:01:50.243 --> 01:01:51.887
Who just wipe their heads clean.

01:01:51.911 --> 01:01:53.454
What do you call that?

01:01:53.496 --> 01:01:55.498
Repressed memory?

01:01:55.540 --> 01:01:58.585
Yeah, repressed.

01:01:58.626 --> 01:02:00.837
What are you thinking about?

01:02:00.879 --> 01:02:03.339
Something my daughter said.

01:02:03.381 --> 01:02:05.300
What? What did she say?

01:02:07.886 --> 01:02:10.263
That I was taught to forget.

01:02:10.305 --> 01:02:12.265
Taught?

01:02:12.307 --> 01:02:16.686
You didn't have
much of a choice, Ray.

01:02:16.728 --> 01:02:20.148
Trauma's a thief.

01:02:20.189 --> 01:02:21.917
The younger you are
when it starts

01:02:21.941 --> 01:02:25.528
and the longer it went on...

01:02:25.570 --> 01:02:28.573
the more memory
it will take from you.

01:02:49.302 --> 01:02:51.596
Jesus, Ray.
What the fuck happened?

01:02:51.638 --> 01:02:53.473
It's not important.

01:02:54.807 --> 01:02:56.517
Yeah, but did you find Mick?

01:02:58.519 --> 01:03:00.229
No.

01:03:02.565 --> 01:03:04.067
What about Bridge?

01:03:04.859 --> 01:03:06.277
Nothing.

01:03:10.698 --> 01:03:12.408
Is that her?

01:03:13.910 --> 01:03:15.119
Yeah?

01:03:15.161 --> 01:03:16.746
Your father called.

01:03:16.788 --> 01:03:17.872
When?

01:03:17.914 --> 01:03:19.391
He's selling
the papers back to me.

01:03:19.415 --> 01:03:22.460
I told him to meet me
at our house in Wellesley.

01:03:22.502 --> 01:03:24.462
I thought you'd wanna know.

01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:26.965
I gotta go.

01:03:27.006 --> 01:03:28.633
Whoa, wait, what's going on?

01:03:28.675 --> 01:03:30.152
Give me the keys. I gotta go.

01:03:30.176 --> 01:03:31.362
No, I'm coming with you.

01:03:31.386 --> 01:03:34.681
No. You stay here.
Keep trying Bridge.

01:03:36.891 --> 01:03:39.894
Tense music

01:04:09.298 --> 01:04:12.010
Lena. Hey.

01:04:12.051 --> 01:04:13.845
Passport,
Social Security papers,

01:04:13.886 --> 01:04:15.680
and birth certificate.

01:04:16.806 --> 01:04:19.058
This is your access code
to your Bancaribe account.

01:04:19.100 --> 01:04:21.769
I want you to memorize it
and throw the paper away.

01:04:22.937 --> 01:04:24.522
Bancaribe. Okay.

01:04:25.189 --> 01:04:26.250
Now, I already checked you in

01:04:26.274 --> 01:04:27.459
and made sure
your passport cleared,

01:04:27.483 --> 01:04:30.278
but they're gonna check it
again at the gate.

01:04:30.319 --> 01:04:33.990
- Caracas?
- They don't extradite.

01:04:34.032 --> 01:04:35.175
- Okay.
- All right.

01:04:35.199 --> 01:04:37.285
What I want you to do
is go through security

01:04:37.326 --> 01:04:40.538
and stop for nothing,
not even the fucking bathroom.

01:04:40.580 --> 01:04:43.124
You're gonna get to the gate,
you're gonna go on the plane

01:04:43.166 --> 01:04:44.417
and pretend you're asleep.

01:04:44.459 --> 01:04:46.002
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

01:04:46.044 --> 01:04:48.379
So when... when can I come back?

01:04:51.215 --> 01:04:54.469
What? I... I can't come back?

01:04:55.136 --> 01:04:58.222
Not unless you wanna spend the
rest of your life in prison.

01:05:02.226 --> 01:05:05.021
Daryll, don't fuck around.

01:05:05.063 --> 01:05:08.357
Just get through security
and lay low until your flight.

01:05:09.984 --> 01:05:12.028
- Okay?
- Okay.

01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:26.811
Hello?

01:06:27.854 --> 01:06:29.605
Hey.

01:06:30.106 --> 01:06:31.858
I'm in Boston.

01:06:33.484 --> 01:06:34.485
So?

01:06:34.527 --> 01:06:37.280
So I'm...

01:06:37.321 --> 01:06:41.701
I'm standing on the porch
of the house where I grew up.

01:06:45.037 --> 01:06:48.875
And I... I don't know,
I got to thinking...

01:06:52.795 --> 01:06:55.298
what if I could get a do-over?

01:06:58.217 --> 01:07:03.347
You know, what if I bought
the house back, hmm?

01:07:04.098 --> 01:07:05.975
What if I tried again?

01:07:11.147 --> 01:07:12.249
I really think we could make

01:07:12.273 --> 01:07:15.568
some beautiful
family memories here.

01:07:15.610 --> 01:07:19.071
Brendan, you know
it doesn't work that way.

01:07:19.113 --> 01:07:20.072
You know that.

01:07:20.114 --> 01:07:21.532
Well, what if it did?

01:07:21.574 --> 01:07:22.843
If it did, we'd all go back

01:07:22.867 --> 01:07:24.118
to the shithole we grew up in

01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:26.204
and live happily ever after,

01:07:26.245 --> 01:07:28.581
every single one of us.

01:07:39.342 --> 01:07:41.594
You wanna
come out here and visit?

01:07:42.637 --> 01:07:43.971
Come out here.

01:07:44.931 --> 01:07:46.224
I ain't making no promises,

01:07:46.265 --> 01:07:50.102
but come out here

01:07:50.144 --> 01:07:51.979
and you get a job,

01:07:52.021 --> 01:07:53.898
and get some help.

01:07:53.940 --> 01:07:55.733
Maybe I get some help.

01:07:59.695 --> 01:08:00.738
Maybe.

01:08:06.244 --> 01:08:08.287
Maybe.

01:08:08.329 --> 01:08:10.122
Best I can do.

01:10:30.721 --> 01:10:33.182
Might not be a good time,
Mr. Goldman.

01:10:35.309 --> 01:10:37.269
Call me Ezra, please.

01:10:37.311 --> 01:10:39.730
Might not be a good time, Ezra.

01:10:39.772 --> 01:10:42.316
I'm sorry,
I don't remember your name.

01:10:42.358 --> 01:10:44.193
Ray.

01:10:44.235 --> 01:10:47.154
Of course. Ray.

01:10:50.825 --> 01:10:54.286
Mickey was just teaching me
how to talk Southie.

01:10:54.328 --> 01:10:56.056
Let's go to the packies
for some jimmies

01:10:56.080 --> 01:10:56.997
so I can bang

01:10:57.039 --> 01:10:58.879
the wicked hot cashier
at Dunkies.

01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:04.797
You ready?

01:11:04.839 --> 01:11:05.756
What?

01:11:05.798 --> 01:11:07.317
I thought we'd have
some dinner over at Nona's,

01:11:07.341 --> 01:11:09.385
maybe take in the town a little?

01:11:09.427 --> 01:11:12.138
Sorry, Ezra. Not tonight.

01:11:12.179 --> 01:11:13.514
No?

01:11:13.556 --> 01:11:15.683
I'm working. You know that.

01:11:15.724 --> 01:11:20.646
I'm doing the whole method
thing, and Mickey, he's...

01:11:23.107 --> 01:11:25.734
Of course.

01:11:25.776 --> 01:11:28.237
Do your thing, bubala.
I love you. Have fun.

01:11:28.279 --> 01:11:31.282
You can take the rest
of the night off, too, Ray.

01:11:31.323 --> 01:11:32.408
Thanks for everything.

01:11:32.450 --> 01:11:35.703
Yeah, just take the rest
of the night off, Ray.

01:11:43.252 --> 01:11:44.920
Do me a favor.

01:11:44.962 --> 01:11:45.796
Keep an eye on that one,

01:11:45.838 --> 01:11:48.174
and call me
if anything comes up.

01:11:50.676 --> 01:11:52.887
I'll take care of it,
Mr. Goldman.

01:11:57.266 --> 01:11:58.726
Ray.

01:12:02.521 --> 01:12:05.274
You know what chutzpah is?

01:12:05.316 --> 01:12:06.525
No, sir.

01:12:08.152 --> 01:12:09.904
Well, you've got it.

01:12:11.113 --> 01:12:13.282
Don't worry, it's a good thing.

01:12:44.271 --> 01:12:46.315
Oh, you're bad.

01:12:49.652 --> 01:12:52.029
You're gonna get me in trouble.

01:13:13.342 --> 01:13:15.427
Whoo!

01:13:24.603 --> 01:13:27.147
Oh, I got fucking stories.

01:13:27.189 --> 01:13:29.733
True ones!

01:13:29.775 --> 01:13:32.861
None of the priests I know
are fucking vigilantes.

01:13:32.903 --> 01:13:34.363
Ray!

01:13:35.197 --> 01:13:36.991
Vigilantes?

01:13:37.032 --> 01:13:38.117
Hi, baby.

01:13:38.158 --> 01:13:40.136
They're too busy putting their
dicks where they don't belong.

01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:41.579
What?

01:13:43.539 --> 01:13:46.083
You gotta help me out here, Ray.

01:13:46.125 --> 01:13:47.626
They had enough fucking coke

01:13:47.668 --> 01:13:49.545
to last them
till fucking New Year's.

01:13:49.587 --> 01:13:50.546
I gotta close.

01:13:50.588 --> 01:13:51.964
They're all corrupt.

01:13:53.340 --> 01:13:55.175
Yeah, all right.

01:13:55.217 --> 01:13:56.427
It's why you need guys like me

01:13:56.468 --> 01:14:00.139
to keep the scorecard even,
you know?

01:14:00.180 --> 01:14:01.724
Ted wants to close up.

01:14:01.765 --> 01:14:05.477
Oh, not unless he's out of
fucking whiskey, he's not.

01:14:05.519 --> 01:14:06.746
Not unless he's out

01:14:06.770 --> 01:14:08.439
of fucking whiskey, he's not.

01:14:12.109 --> 01:14:13.277
Time to go.

01:14:14.236 --> 01:14:17.031
Hey, oh, how do...
What do you say...

01:14:17.072 --> 01:14:18.532
Southie slang for cash?

01:14:18.574 --> 01:14:20.492
Cash.

01:14:22.745 --> 01:14:27.750
Uh, I will give you,
my good sir, a grand of cash,

01:14:27.791 --> 01:14:30.628
if you let us stay another hour.

01:14:30.669 --> 01:14:32.296
Ray, lock up.

01:14:33.464 --> 01:14:34.715
Come on, Ray.

01:14:34.757 --> 01:14:38.761
When are we ever gonna party
with a movie star again?

01:14:39.845 --> 01:14:41.305
Yeah, Ray, when are we ever

01:14:41.347 --> 01:14:43.267
gonna get to party
with a movie star again?

01:14:49.104 --> 01:14:50.230
Sure.

01:15:49.373 --> 01:15:50.833
Where's Mick?

01:15:51.166 --> 01:15:52.334
He's gone.

01:16:10.269 --> 01:16:12.938
He told me it was yours.

01:16:12.980 --> 01:16:14.064
What?

01:16:14.106 --> 01:16:15.107
The money.

01:16:15.149 --> 01:16:17.234
He told me it was yours.

01:16:17.651 --> 01:16:19.236
He didn't take it?

01:16:20.362 --> 01:16:21.947
No.

01:16:23.949 --> 01:16:26.785
It is yours, isn't it, Ray?

01:16:28.662 --> 01:16:29.788
What?

01:16:29.830 --> 01:16:34.293
It's what you've been after
all along, isn't it?

01:16:34.334 --> 01:16:35.544
No.

01:16:35.586 --> 01:16:38.172
You wanted the money
and you helped him.

01:16:38.213 --> 01:16:39.631
Just say it.

01:16:45.721 --> 01:16:47.639
Look, Molly.

01:16:47.681 --> 01:16:51.602
Ray, where is he? I'm so tired.

01:16:51.643 --> 01:16:52.954
I just... I just want you
to tell me

01:16:52.978 --> 01:16:55.147
what you've done to my father.

01:17:15.417 --> 01:17:16.752
I'm sorry.

01:17:51.703 --> 01:17:53.372
Ray.

01:18:07.427 --> 01:18:08.804
Oh.

01:18:50.637 --> 01:18:52.931
Ray, where is he?

01:18:59.396 --> 01:19:02.900
I just want you to tell me
what you've done to my father.

01:19:06.987 --> 01:19:08.572
Do you?

01:19:11.325 --> 01:19:12.701
Do you?

01:19:18.999 --> 01:19:20.709
What did you do, Ray?

01:19:24.838 --> 01:19:28.300
What did you do, Raymond?

01:19:28.342 --> 01:19:31.678
What did you do?

01:19:32.846 --> 01:19:35.474
What?
I banged it back like you said.

01:19:35.515 --> 01:19:37.851
Yeah, but you're
still drinking it.

01:19:37.893 --> 01:19:41.104
Yeah, she'll tell you
she's an orphan

01:19:41.146 --> 01:19:43.607
You oughta open your mouth

01:19:43.649 --> 01:19:45.293
and throw the whiskey
back in there

01:19:45.317 --> 01:19:47.420
like you're trying to splash
the back of your throat.

01:19:47.444 --> 01:19:50.739
The Black Crowes'
"She Talks to Angels"

01:19:57.621 --> 01:20:00.207
You dance good, Mick.

01:20:00.248 --> 01:20:02.668
Even if it doesn't
really match the song.

01:20:04.670 --> 01:20:05.629
Oh!

01:20:05.671 --> 01:20:07.714
Oh, shit.

01:20:13.929 --> 01:20:16.348
- Sorry.
- You all right?

01:20:16.390 --> 01:20:18.100
Sorry, sweetheart.

01:20:18.141 --> 01:20:19.685
Take a seat, Mickey.

01:20:19.726 --> 01:20:20.954
Gotta sit this one out.

01:20:20.978 --> 01:20:23.689
She paints her eyes
as black as night now

01:20:23.730 --> 01:20:26.483
Mm, I need a cigarette.

01:20:26.525 --> 01:20:27.401
Who's got a cigarette?

01:20:27.442 --> 01:20:30.028
Pulls those shades down tight

01:20:30.070 --> 01:20:31.321
Okay.

01:20:31.363 --> 01:20:33.782
Yeah, she gives a smile
when the pain come

01:20:36.868 --> 01:20:39.830
Pain gonna make everything
all right

01:20:39.871 --> 01:20:41.915
Your father's
a fucking character.

01:20:43.834 --> 01:20:47.379
You know, I'm basing
my whole performance on him.

01:20:47.421 --> 01:20:49.131
Yeah?

01:20:49.172 --> 01:20:50.900
His tough-but-heart-of-gold
stuff, you know?

01:20:50.924 --> 01:20:54.511
They call her out by her name

01:20:55.470 --> 01:20:58.140
Oh, yeah, she talks to angels

01:20:58.181 --> 01:21:01.143
He's got him good, Ray.

01:21:01.184 --> 01:21:03.770
Oh, my God, that's perfect.

01:21:03.812 --> 01:21:06.481
Don't do that.

01:21:06.523 --> 01:21:08.650
You shoot a guy in the back,

01:21:08.692 --> 01:21:10.360
that's a warning.

01:21:10.402 --> 01:21:14.489
You wanna make him dead,
pop him in the head.

01:21:14.531 --> 01:21:15.574
Put the gun down.

01:21:15.615 --> 01:21:16.658
It rhymes, you know?

01:21:16.700 --> 01:21:18.845
Two in the head, make 'em dead.
Two in the head, make 'em dead.

01:21:18.869 --> 01:21:20.949
Two in the head, make 'em...

01:21:26.001 --> 01:21:27.001
Oh, my God.

01:21:29.171 --> 01:21:33.175
Oh, fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

01:21:33.216 --> 01:21:35.761
The cross from someone
she has not met

01:21:35.802 --> 01:21:39.181
I killed her.

01:21:39.222 --> 01:21:42.142
Oh, my fucking God.

01:21:44.436 --> 01:21:47.647
My life.

01:21:47.689 --> 01:21:50.525
My fucking life. Oh, my God.

01:21:50.567 --> 01:21:53.570
Oh, yeah, she talks to angels

01:21:53.612 --> 01:21:56.114
Ray, Ray,
what am I gonna do, Ray?

01:21:56.156 --> 01:21:58.909
Says they call her out
by her name

01:21:58.950 --> 01:22:01.703
What am I gonna do?

01:22:01.745 --> 01:22:04.247
I didn't mean to.
I swear to God, Ray.

01:22:04.289 --> 01:22:07.793
Jesus Christ.

01:22:07.834 --> 01:22:10.128
I'm going to prison.

01:22:10.170 --> 01:22:13.924
I'm going to fucking prison.
I'm going to prison.

01:22:21.765 --> 01:22:23.141
Give me the gun.

01:22:26.603 --> 01:22:27.646
Give it to me.

01:22:33.235 --> 01:22:35.028
You were in your trailer.

01:22:35.070 --> 01:22:39.116
You had a few too many
with Mick and you slept there.

01:22:39.157 --> 01:22:41.618
- What?
- Say it.

01:22:46.081 --> 01:22:49.251
I got drunk in my trailer
with Mickey

01:22:49.292 --> 01:22:53.171
and I... I slept there.

01:23:01.388 --> 01:23:05.225
Gives a smile
when the pain comes

01:23:07.060 --> 01:23:11.064
The pain's gonna make
everything all right

01:23:11.106 --> 01:23:13.108
- Hello?
- Mr. Goldman.

01:23:13.150 --> 01:23:15.402
You better meet Sean
in his trailer.

01:23:15.443 --> 01:23:16.862
Now!

01:23:16.903 --> 01:23:18.989
I'll call you later
with a place we can talk.

01:23:19.030 --> 01:23:23.160
Says they call her out
by her name

01:23:24.870 --> 01:23:26.788
Oh, yeah

01:23:26.830 --> 01:23:31.710
Angels

01:23:31.751 --> 01:23:35.463
Call her out by her name

01:23:37.132 --> 01:23:41.970
Oh, angels

01:23:43.805 --> 01:23:47.976
Call her out by her name

01:23:49.269 --> 01:23:50.729
Oh

01:23:50.770 --> 01:23:55.358
She talks to angels

01:23:55.400 --> 01:23:58.069
They call her out

01:23:58.111 --> 01:24:00.947
Yeah

01:24:00.989 --> 01:24:04.075
Call her out

01:24:04.117 --> 01:24:05.785
Don't you know

01:24:05.827 --> 01:24:08.955
That they call her out

01:24:08.997 --> 01:24:11.666
By her name

01:24:14.002 --> 01:24:17.672
Ray Ray. Ray Ray.

01:24:17.714 --> 01:24:19.424
Ray.

01:24:21.009 --> 01:24:22.969
You okay?

01:24:24.221 --> 01:24:25.931
Ray.

01:24:27.390 --> 01:24:30.477
You all right? Unlock the door.

01:24:31.603 --> 01:24:33.271
Unlock it.

01:24:41.613 --> 01:24:44.032
You okay? Huh?

01:24:44.074 --> 01:24:45.992
I gotta call Ezra.

01:24:47.452 --> 01:24:49.162
Come on.
I'll help ya, I'll help ya.

01:24:49.204 --> 01:24:50.747
Here, here.

01:24:58.255 --> 01:24:59.673
Here.

01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:12.018
Here.

01:25:14.020 --> 01:25:16.356
Just lie down. Just lie...

01:25:22.529 --> 01:25:25.282
Let me see what you got, Ray.

01:25:25.323 --> 01:25:26.783
Let me see it.

01:25:28.076 --> 01:25:29.327
Here.

01:25:29.369 --> 01:25:31.037
This is bad, Ray Ray.

01:25:31.079 --> 01:25:32.580
I gotta find Bridge.

01:25:32.622 --> 01:25:34.141
Listen to me, Ray Ray.
This is bad.

01:25:34.165 --> 01:25:35.834
We gotta get you to a hospital.

01:25:35.875 --> 01:25:37.502
No hospitals, Mick.

01:25:37.544 --> 01:25:39.796
Put pressure on this.

01:25:39.838 --> 01:25:41.756
I'm gonna get some towels.

01:26:16.875 --> 01:26:18.877
Come on, trust me.

01:26:22.422 --> 01:26:24.716
You're a good boy.

01:26:24.758 --> 01:26:29.346
Don't let no one
tell you something different.

01:26:29.387 --> 01:26:31.097
You were an angel.

01:26:32.932 --> 01:26:34.267
Mick.

01:26:34.309 --> 01:26:36.019
What, son?

01:26:36.061 --> 01:26:40.106
I know...

01:26:40.148 --> 01:26:42.067
I know you tried.

01:26:44.277 --> 01:26:46.780
You get that money, huh?

01:26:46.821 --> 01:26:48.948
No, I didn't take it.

01:26:48.990 --> 01:26:51.409
It was yours. You deserve it.

01:26:51.451 --> 01:26:53.078
No, I don't.

01:26:53.119 --> 01:26:54.412
Yes, you do.

01:26:54.454 --> 01:26:57.165
You deserve the whole world.

01:26:57.207 --> 01:26:58.375
What I did...

01:26:58.416 --> 01:27:00.001
What you did?

01:27:01.544 --> 01:27:04.756
You looked after, Ray.

01:27:04.798 --> 01:27:06.257
You looked after us.

01:27:06.299 --> 01:27:09.094
No. What I did to you.

01:27:10.261 --> 01:27:12.097
I want you to know...

01:27:17.894 --> 01:27:19.771
you didn't deserve that.

01:27:22.232 --> 01:27:23.983
What?

01:27:24.901 --> 01:27:26.903
Fish gotta swim.

01:27:34.285 --> 01:27:35.662
Yeah.

01:27:35.703 --> 01:27:40.834
You remember, fish gotta swim,
birds gotta fly.

01:27:42.043 --> 01:27:46.131
I got to love one man
till I die.

01:27:47.340 --> 01:27:50.718
Stay with me, Ray.
Stay with me. Stay with me.

01:27:53.263 --> 01:27:57.142
Can't help loving
that man of mine

01:27:59.811 --> 01:28:04.607
Tell me he's lazy,
tell me he's slow

01:28:05.650 --> 01:28:10.280
Tell me I'm crazy, maybe I know

01:28:10.321 --> 01:28:13.324
Can't help loving
that man of mine

01:28:18.121 --> 01:28:20.165
When he goes away.

01:28:20.623 --> 01:28:25.253
When he goes away,
that's a rainy day.

01:28:25.295 --> 01:28:29.966
But when he comes back,
the day is fine.

01:28:30.008 --> 01:28:31.384
The sun will shine.

01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:49.527
What did you do?

01:29:03.333 --> 01:29:06.169
It had to stop.

01:29:06.211 --> 01:29:08.546
It had to end.

01:29:21.976 --> 01:29:23.853
It's all right.

01:29:26.231 --> 01:29:27.857
It's all right.

01:29:27.899 --> 01:29:29.901
It's all right.

01:29:29.943 --> 01:29:30.943
It's all right.

01:29:33.154 --> 01:29:36.533
Hey, hey.
I'm gonna be all right.

01:30:01.849 --> 01:30:06.479
Get her outta here, Bunch.
Please.

01:30:06.521 --> 01:30:09.440
You hear me?

01:30:09.482 --> 01:30:11.234
Get her outta here.

01:30:13.069 --> 01:30:15.280
Dad.

01:30:15.321 --> 01:30:18.783
You're gonna be all right.

01:30:18.825 --> 01:30:19.951
Go.

01:30:22.912 --> 01:30:23.997
Go.

01:31:40.531 --> 01:31:42.742
Ray, are you there?

01:31:46.287 --> 01:31:48.498
I know you tried to help me.

01:31:52.669 --> 01:31:55.046
Please keep talking to me.

01:31:57.423 --> 01:32:00.718
I... I didn't tell him.

01:32:00.760 --> 01:32:02.637
You didn't tell him what?

01:32:05.682 --> 01:32:10.478
I didn't tell him...

01:32:10.520 --> 01:32:14.148
that I love him.

01:32:14.190 --> 01:32:17.443
And I'm sorry.

01:32:17.485 --> 01:32:19.570
I'm sorry
for what I did to him. I...

01:32:19.612 --> 01:32:23.199
What did you do to him?

01:32:23.241 --> 01:32:26.744
I put him away.

01:32:26.786 --> 01:32:29.789
He didn't deserve that.

01:32:29.831 --> 01:32:34.711
Wasn't his fault, but I...
I did it.

01:32:39.173 --> 01:32:42.510
Even if I didn't shoot him,
I ended his life 30 years ago.

01:32:45.513 --> 01:32:49.767
What do you mean,
"Even if you didn't shoot him"?

01:33:07.660 --> 01:33:09.245
Room 46...

01:33:09.287 --> 01:33:10.204
Ray.

01:33:10.246 --> 01:33:11.456
Gardner Motel, Boston.

01:33:11.497 --> 01:33:12.766
No. No, wait. Listen...

01:34:33.412 --> 01:34:35.015
The Rolling Stones'
"Shine A Light"

01:34:35.039 --> 01:34:37.667
Saw you stretched out

01:34:37.708 --> 01:34:41.003
In room 1009

01:34:41.045 --> 01:34:44.715
With a smile on your face

01:34:44.757 --> 01:34:47.635
And a tear right in your eye

01:34:47.677 --> 01:34:50.304
Oh

01:34:50.346 --> 01:34:54.517
Couldn't seem
to get a line on you

01:34:55.977 --> 01:34:57.812
My sweet

01:34:57.854 --> 01:35:00.565
Hands, hands!
Let me see your hands!

01:35:00.606 --> 01:35:03.776
Gun! He's got a gun!

01:35:03.818 --> 01:35:05.987
Berber jewellery

01:35:06.028 --> 01:35:09.574
Jangling down the street

01:35:09.615 --> 01:35:11.993
Making bloodshot eyes

01:35:12.034 --> 01:35:14.370
At every woman that you meet

01:35:16.914 --> 01:35:21.836
Could not seem
to get a high on you

01:35:21.878 --> 01:35:26.424
My, my sweet honey love

01:35:26.465 --> 01:35:27.925
Freeze!

01:35:29.343 --> 01:35:34.390
May the good Lord
shine a light on you

01:35:35.808 --> 01:35:40.396
Make every song
your favorited tune

01:35:41.731 --> 01:35:46.277
May the good Lord shine
a light on you

01:35:47.904 --> 01:35:51.407
Warm like the evening sun

01:35:53.117 --> 01:35:56.162
When you're drunk
in the alley, baby

01:35:56.203 --> 01:35:59.206
With your clothes all torn

01:35:59.248 --> 01:36:02.627
When your late night
friends leave you

01:36:02.668 --> 01:36:04.795
In the cold, grey dawn

01:36:04.837 --> 01:36:06.756
Whoa

01:36:06.797 --> 01:36:11.010
Just seemed too many
flies on you

01:36:12.303 --> 01:36:15.973
I just can't brush them off

01:36:18.142 --> 01:36:20.853
The angels beating

01:36:20.895 --> 01:36:24.106
All their wings in time

01:36:24.148 --> 01:36:27.026
Smiles on their faces

01:36:27.068 --> 01:36:29.570
And a gleam right in their eyes

01:36:29.612 --> 01:36:33.658
Whoa, thought I heard one

01:36:33.699 --> 01:36:36.911
Sigh for you

01:36:36.953 --> 01:36:40.122
Come on up now, come on up now

01:36:40.164 --> 01:36:42.792
Come on up now

01:36:42.833 --> 01:36:47.213
May the good Lord shine
a light on you

01:36:47.254 --> 01:36:51.634
Yeah, make every song you sing

01:36:51.676 --> 01:36:54.136
Your favorite tune

01:36:54.178 --> 01:36:58.766
May the good Lord
shine a light on you

01:36:58.808 --> 01:37:03.604
Yeah, warm like the evening sun

01:37:03.646 --> 01:37:07.024
Ah-nah-nah-nah-yeah

01:37:41.892 --> 01:37:44.895
Come on up now, come on up now

01:37:44.937 --> 01:37:47.857
Come on up now, come on up

01:37:47.898 --> 01:37:51.944
May the good Lord
shine a light on you

01:37:53.779 --> 01:37:56.866
Make every song you sing

01:37:56.907 --> 01:37:59.326
Your favorite tune

01:37:59.368 --> 01:38:03.539
May the good Lord
shine a light on you

01:38:05.207 --> 01:38:08.294
Warm like the evening sun

01:38:08.335 --> 01:38:11.922
Ah-nah-nah-nah-nah yeah

01:38:11.964 --> 01:38:13.549
Yeah
