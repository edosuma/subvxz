Oh, my God, are you still
obsessed with Kent?

00:44.211 --> 00:45.511
Just ask him out already.

00:45.513 --> 00:47.312
The worst that could happen
is he says no.

00:47.314 --> 00:49.548
Are you kidding? Of
course he'll say no.

00:49.550 --> 00:51.717
There's no way he'd
ever go out with me.

00:51.719 --> 00:53.252
He's just so...

00:53.254 --> 00:55.020
dreamy.

00:55.022 --> 00:58.223
Oh, Kent,
what are we gonna do?

00:58.225 --> 01:01.193
With the Earth destroyed,
we're the only two humans left.

01:01.195 --> 01:03.562

need to start repopulating.

Should we wake her up?

01:25.453 --> 01:27.920
No, she's got to learn
to breathe out of her nose.

01:27.922 --> 01:29.188
(breathing heavily)

01:29.190 --> 01:31.290

Peter, you want
another waffle?

01:36.764 --> 01:37.896
I can't Lois.

01:37.898 --> 01:39.565
I promised Janice
I'd take her shift.

01:39.567 --> 01:41.400

Sure thing, honey. Adam and
Eve on a raft, wreck them!

01:43.537 --> 01:46.071
I'd like a hotdog with ketchup
and some Jell-O, please.

01:46.073 --> 01:48.574

Psst.

02:00.154 --> 02:01.987
Hey, dog.
What?

02:01.989 --> 02:03.722
You want in?

02:03.724 --> 02:06.258
Yeah.

02:06.260 --> 02:07.659
Ah, look at this.

02:07.661 --> 02:10.629
She's taped photographs of
Virginia Woolf and Katy Perry

02:10.631 --> 02:13.132
on the inside cover,
as if she's some sort

02:13.134 --> 02:14.633
of hip hybrid
of those two things.

02:14.635 --> 02:16.268
Ugh. Yeah, like
she could ever write

02:16.270 --> 02:17.402
<i>Who's Afraid of</i>
<i>Virginia Woolf?</i>

02:17.404 --> 02:19.238
Brian,
Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?

02:19.240 --> 02:21.240
was not written
by Virginia Woolf.

02:21.242 --> 02:22.407
Yeah, obviously.

02:22.409 --> 02:24.409
But, you know, it's-it's
pretty much about her.

02:24.411 --> 02:26.145
It really isn't, Brian.

02:26.147 --> 02:29.214
Let's, uh, let's just
get into this, huh?

02:30.483 --> 02:33.085
"Dear Diary, got
down to 152 today.

02:33.087 --> 02:34.786
Think that's a
nice weight for me."

02:34.788 --> 02:36.155
Oh, here's another one.

02:36.157 --> 02:39.158
"Dear Diary, just discovered
the music of John Denver.

02:39.160 --> 02:41.660
Wow-wee, where's this been?"

02:41.662 --> 02:43.195
Hey, look at this.

02:43.197 --> 02:45.464
"Kent is so incredibly sexy.

02:45.466 --> 02:48.033
"He said 'hi' to me
today, and I almost died.

02:48.035 --> 02:52.304
"Also, I learned a funny lesson
today in my pursuit of Kent:

02:52.306 --> 02:55.674
anal bleaching is better
left to professionals. LOL."

02:55.676 --> 02:58.277
Oh, oh!
No, no, no,
come on, now, come on.

02:58.279 --> 03:01.313
Jeez, it's just pages and pages
of stuff about this Kent guy.

03:01.315 --> 03:02.681
She's really obsessed with him.

03:02.683 --> 03:04.383
Well, obsession's not such
a bad thing.

03:04.385 --> 03:06.385
It got us
the first printing press.

03:06.387 --> 03:07.886
You're a whore, Sheila,

03:07.888 --> 03:09.955
and I'm gonna make sure
everybody knows it!

03:21.568 --> 03:23.168
Here!

03:23.170 --> 03:25.070
I can't read.

03:25.072 --> 03:26.471
No one can read.

03:31.344 --> 03:33.212
Bye, Patty. Bye, Esther.

03:33.214 --> 03:34.513
Bye, overzealous Asian kids

03:34.515 --> 03:36.882
lining up to be the first ones
in school tomorrow.

03:36.884 --> 03:39.218
Go away. No time
to say "bye."

03:39.220 --> 03:42.221
(laughs) I pass you
'cause you lose focus!

03:42.223 --> 03:44.022
Damn! Lost focus!

03:44.024 --> 03:46.124
Life over!

03:55.101 --> 03:58.770
Oh, Kent,
this is all I ever wanted.

03:58.772 --> 04:00.372
I feel the same way, Meg.

04:00.374 --> 04:03.842
From today onward,
this is our life.

04:03.844 --> 04:05.444
We should get
off the horse soon.

04:05.446 --> 04:08.213
I want to save one for you.

04:08.215 --> 04:10.282
(horn honking, tires squealing)

04:11.784 --> 04:12.951
Oh, my God!

04:12.953 --> 04:14.419
Are you all right?

04:14.421 --> 04:17.489
Lucky for you,
this tree was my destination.

04:20.293 --> 04:23.128
And the job exchange begins.

04:23.130 --> 04:24.863
Sir, do you want to move ahead

04:24.865 --> 04:27.532
on the agreement
with the sanitation union?

04:27.534 --> 04:29.568
Sir, we need leadership.

04:29.570 --> 04:30.802
Oh, my God, Meg!

04:30.804 --> 04:32.104
Are you okay?

04:32.106 --> 04:33.272
Yeah, I-I'm fine.

04:33.274 --> 04:35.374
I guess I got distracted again
thinking about Kent.

04:35.376 --> 04:37.309
Oh, I can't do this anymore.

04:37.311 --> 04:39.611
I've just got to ask him out.

04:39.613 --> 04:41.446
Sorry!

04:47.287 --> 04:49.254
Honey, give me
any laundry you have.

04:49.256 --> 04:51.123
I'm doing a diapers
and Meg load.

04:51.125 --> 04:53.225
Hey, Mom, can I ask you
about something?

04:53.227 --> 04:55.460
Of course, Meg.
What's on your mind?

04:55.462 --> 04:57.396
Well, there's this guy
I like at school,

04:57.398 --> 04:58.930
and I was thinking about,

04:58.932 --> 05:02.167
I-I don't know, maybe
calling him and...

05:02.169 --> 05:04.803
Meg, are you asking,
in this day and age,

05:04.805 --> 05:07.339
when the CEO of Xerox
is a woman,

05:07.341 --> 05:09.474
when the president
of Brazil is a woman,

05:09.476 --> 05:11.343
even Rosie O'Donnell
is a woman,

05:11.345 --> 05:13.412
whether it's appropriate
for a girl

05:13.414 --> 05:15.314
to ask a boy out on a date?

05:15.316 --> 05:17.282
Of course it's appropriate.

05:17.284 --> 05:21.019
It's also sad and desperate
and I would never do it,

05:21.021 --> 05:22.854
but you're not me,
are you, sweetie?

05:22.856 --> 05:24.189
No, I'm not.

05:24.191 --> 05:26.258
(laughing):
No, you're not.

05:28.361 --> 05:31.129
(sighs)

05:31.131 --> 05:32.698
(phone rings)

05:32.700 --> 05:34.466
Hello?
Hey, Kent?

05:34.468 --> 05:36.134
It's Meg, from
English class.

05:36.136 --> 05:37.336
Uh...

05:37.338 --> 05:38.603
And math class?

05:38.605 --> 05:40.138
And bio?

05:40.140 --> 05:42.307
And the Facebook campaign
to get me to kill myself?

05:42.309 --> 05:43.475
Oh, Meg!

05:43.477 --> 05:45.110
Hey, what's up?
Hey!

05:45.112 --> 05:46.378
Um, nothing much.

05:46.380 --> 05:48.613
I was just wondering

05:48.615 --> 05:51.049
if you maybe wanted
to hang out some time?

05:51.051 --> 05:52.284
Sure.

05:52.286 --> 05:54.386
Oh, wow, cool!

05:54.388 --> 05:57.289
Okay, um,
I'll-I'll text you?

05:57.291 --> 05:58.290
(beeps)

05:58.292 --> 06:01.159
(screams)
Yes! I can't believe it!

06:01.161 --> 06:04.663
Oh, my God, I'm going out
on a date with Kent Lastname.

06:04.665 --> 06:06.465
Yes! Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

06:06.467 --> 06:07.299
(screams)

06:07.301 --> 06:08.633
Oh, my gosh!

06:08.635 --> 06:11.603
I'm gonna go ahead
and shut this for you.

06:17.143 --> 06:18.944
(knocking)

06:20.580 --> 06:21.747
Oh, hello.

06:21.749 --> 06:23.014
Hi, you must be
Mrs. Griffin.

06:23.016 --> 06:24.983
I'm Kent.
I'm here to pick up Meg.

06:24.985 --> 06:26.885
Oh, Kent, it's so
nice to meet you.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.487
She's just getting ready.

06:28.489 --> 06:30.088
Meg, Kent's here!

06:30.090 --> 06:32.023
Just putting on my lipstick.

06:32.025 --> 06:33.558
Damn it.

06:33.560 --> 06:35.560
And this is Meg's brother,
Chris.

06:35.562 --> 06:36.995
Oh, yeah,
I've seen you around school.

06:36.997 --> 06:38.597
You eat
with the deaf kids, right?

06:38.599 --> 06:40.665
One of them isn't
all the way deaf.

06:40.667 --> 06:42.200
What grade are you in again?

06:42.202 --> 06:44.603
That's still being worked
out by a team of counselors.

06:44.605 --> 06:46.538
Cool.
Hope to see you around school.

06:46.540 --> 06:48.173
He seems nice.

06:48.175 --> 06:49.374
Sorry, I missed all that.

06:49.376 --> 06:50.509
I was tweeting.

06:59.085 --> 07:02.220
MOVIE ANNOUNCER:
Coming this fall,
the prequel to <i>Philadelphia.</i>

07:02.222 --> 07:03.855
Are you sure
we don't need a condom?

07:03.857 --> 07:05.524
No, it's okay,
I'm a lawyer.

07:05.526 --> 07:08.727
(loud kissing noises)

07:08.729 --> 07:10.896
(yawns)

07:10.898 --> 07:13.899
How you girls doing on popcorn?

07:13.901 --> 07:15.066
I'll take some.

07:15.068 --> 07:16.701
Here you go.

07:16.703 --> 07:19.438
(yawns)

07:19.440 --> 07:22.507
Oh, sorry, am I taking
up the whole armrest?

07:23.776 --> 07:26.278
Boy, it's kind
of chilly in here.

07:26.280 --> 07:28.713
Really? You got big sweat
marks under your boobs.

07:28.715 --> 07:31.817
That must mean
they must like you then.

07:31.819 --> 07:32.984
(forced giggling)

07:32.986 --> 07:34.419
Hey, I'll be
right back.

07:34.421 --> 07:36.488
I got to go to
the bathroom.

07:36.490 --> 07:38.623
Oh, thank God.

07:42.829 --> 07:44.095
And now,
our feature presentation:

07:44.097 --> 07:47.799
<i>Adrien Brody Doing Sit-Ups</i>

07:49.235 --> 07:50.302
ADRIEN BRODY:
One.

07:50.304 --> 07:51.436
(crowd screams)

07:51.438 --> 07:53.405
Two.
(screams)

07:53.407 --> 07:56.074
(tires squeak)

07:56.076 --> 07:58.243
That was fun.

07:58.245 --> 07:59.945
We should hang out
again some time.

07:59.947 --> 08:01.079
Yeah, definitely.

08:01.081 --> 08:02.681
Well, good night.

08:02.683 --> 08:03.782
Night.

08:03.784 --> 08:06.418
Oh, no, I'm sorry.
Oh, my God, I thought you...

08:06.420 --> 08:09.187
I didn't think
this was a date.
Oh, my God.
I'm so embarrassed!

08:09.189 --> 08:11.256
Hey, it's 10:30!

08:11.258 --> 08:14.359
I suggest you take your dope
and go elsewhere!

08:14.361 --> 08:15.994
I'm sorry, Meg. I
think you're great,

08:15.996 --> 08:17.629
and I love hanging
out with you,

08:17.631 --> 08:19.764
but there's something
you should know.

08:19.766 --> 08:21.199
I'm gay.

08:21.201 --> 08:22.801
You are?

08:22.803 --> 08:25.937
Look, I really like you as a
friend, but to be honest...

08:25.939 --> 08:27.639
I like Chris.

08:27.641 --> 08:28.874
What?

08:28.876 --> 08:31.676
I have a shoe appointment
in the morning,

08:31.678 --> 08:32.944
and I want to be fresh!

08:32.946 --> 08:35.046
Yeah, the person
I'm attracted to

08:35.048 --> 08:36.448
is your brother.

08:36.450 --> 08:38.316
Brother?

08:38.318 --> 08:39.885
Rupert, did you hear that?

08:39.887 --> 08:41.853
Meg's boyfriend
is in love with me.

08:41.855 --> 08:43.054
Not that I care.

08:43.056 --> 08:45.156
I mean, it won't matter
once I explain to him

08:45.158 --> 08:46.858
what's going on with us.

08:46.860 --> 08:51.029
But what would I tell him
is going on with us?

08:54.166 --> 08:56.234
(sobbing)

09:08.014 --> 09:10.081
(sobbing continues)

09:20.259 --> 09:22.027
Thanks, Brian!

09:22.029 --> 09:23.562
Brian?

09:23.564 --> 09:25.864
Hey... princess.

09:25.866 --> 09:27.566
I'll get out of your hair.

09:27.568 --> 09:29.034
I can see you want
to be left alone.

09:29.036 --> 09:31.570
Why does everything bad
always happen to me?

09:31.572 --> 09:33.004
Huh, you and me both.

09:33.006 --> 09:34.873
I got this cold.
(coughing)

09:34.875 --> 09:37.409
And it's-it's
just in that

09:37.411 --> 09:39.844
"I don't want to give it to
a friend" stage, you know?

09:39.846 --> 09:41.580
(sniffling)
Oh, God, you hear that?

09:41.582 --> 09:43.548
I sound like a
Jewish See 'n Say.

09:43.550 --> 09:45.917
The uncle says...

09:45.919 --> 09:48.587
(phlegmy coughing)

09:48.589 --> 09:50.088
The grandpa says...

09:50.090 --> 09:51.790
GRANDPA:
What?!

09:51.792 --> 09:52.924
The aunt says...

09:52.926 --> 09:54.693
AUNT:
Oh-h.

09:54.695 --> 09:56.294
Kent told me he's gay,

09:56.296 --> 09:58.697
and even worse,
he likes Chris!

09:58.699 --> 10:00.932
Oh, wow, I'm really
sorry to hear that, Meg.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.100
I don't get it.

10:02.102 --> 10:04.402
I've been going to high school
with him for three years,

10:04.404 --> 10:06.605
and I always assumed
he was straight.

10:06.607 --> 10:08.406
Well, high school's
a tough time, Meg.

10:08.408 --> 10:09.874
Maybe he thought
he was straight,

10:09.876 --> 10:11.409
but then realized
he's gay.

10:11.411 --> 10:12.877
He's probably still
figuring things out.

10:12.879 --> 10:14.813
Hang in there.

10:14.815 --> 10:16.948
Well, I'll help him
figure things out.

10:16.950 --> 10:20.018
I'll help him figure out
that he's straight.

10:23.956 --> 10:26.057
That was really close.

10:30.830 --> 10:32.564
Hey, Chris, you
mind if I sit here?

10:32.566 --> 10:33.765
No, of course not.

10:33.767 --> 10:36.668
We were just having
a political discussion.

10:45.978 --> 10:48.446
Bill's, uh...
kind of conservative.

10:48.448 --> 10:50.081
Hey, you know,
it was really cool

10:50.083 --> 10:51.249
meeting you the
other night.

10:51.251 --> 10:53.084
I was thinking maybe we
should hang out sometime.

10:53.086 --> 10:56.087
Sure. I sleep for, like, six
hours every day after school,

10:56.089 --> 10:58.023
but other than that,
I'm pretty open.

10:58.025 --> 10:59.357
Well, great, then
we should definitely...

10:59.359 --> 11:00.859
Oh, hey, Meg.

11:00.861 --> 11:03.461
Listen, I hope you're okay
after the other night.

11:03.463 --> 11:04.796
Yeah, no,
that's-that's what

11:04.798 --> 11:06.364
I wanted to talk to
you about, Kent.

11:06.366 --> 11:09.134
Look, I-I know you're going
through a confusing time.

11:09.136 --> 11:10.602
The thing is, though,

11:10.604 --> 11:13.271
I feel like you're
not actually gay.

11:13.273 --> 11:14.606
What?

11:14.608 --> 11:16.207
No, I-I told you, I am.

11:16.209 --> 11:17.876
You don't talk
or act gay.

11:17.878 --> 11:19.310
I mean, you
play football.

11:19.312 --> 11:21.046
Those jeans cost
20 bucks, tops.

11:21.048 --> 11:23.348
And you only use
"hello" as a greeting,

11:23.350 --> 11:25.316
not as a way to outdo
some imaginary antagonist

11:25.318 --> 11:26.685
in conversation.

11:26.687 --> 11:27.886
Meg, please stop.

11:27.888 --> 11:29.654
I know your heart's
in the right place, but...

11:29.656 --> 11:30.722
Actually, it's not.

11:30.724 --> 11:32.524
It's a serious
medical condition.

11:32.526 --> 11:36.127
Yeah, that's...
that's not supposed to be there,

11:36.129 --> 11:39.130
so she should probably
always wear a hat.

11:41.901 --> 11:43.568
Hey.
Hey.

11:43.570 --> 11:45.570
So I guess you heard
about Meg's boyfriend, huh?

11:45.572 --> 11:46.971
I did.
I did hear, yes.

11:46.973 --> 11:48.139
Weird, right?

11:48.141 --> 11:49.974
Guy has a crush
on her own brother.

11:49.976 --> 11:53.244
But, you know, the heart wants
what the heart wants.

11:53.246 --> 11:54.879
I just hope it doesn't
cause awkwardness,

11:54.881 --> 11:55.980
you know, in the house.

11:55.982 --> 11:57.415
Oh, no, it doesn't have
to be awkward,

11:57.417 --> 11:58.917
not if we don't make it awkward.

11:58.919 --> 12:00.318
I just don't see
the attraction.

12:00.320 --> 12:02.253
I mean, is it all
about that big package?

12:02.255 --> 12:03.988
Big? You really think so?

12:03.990 --> 12:06.024
Are you kidding?
Biggest in the family.

12:06.026 --> 12:08.093
That thing should be hanging
from the ceiling of a deli.

12:08.095 --> 12:09.394
Thanks, Brian.

12:09.396 --> 12:11.029
God, I have
so much energy now.

12:11.031 --> 12:15.066
(giggling):
Am I the only one
who feels like grabbing a drink?

12:19.171 --> 12:21.840
Hey, do you think
this picture is hot?

12:23.609 --> 12:25.076
Kind of, yeah.

12:25.078 --> 12:27.078
Well guess what:
that's <i>my</i> back.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.747
Hook up with me!
Come on!

12:28.749 --> 12:30.181
We can make this work.

12:30.183 --> 12:32.283
Just stick your head in here
and pretend it's a butt.

12:32.285 --> 12:33.618
No, Meg, stop it.

12:33.620 --> 12:35.086
God, this is
getting too weird.

12:35.088 --> 12:37.388
I can't be
your boyfriend.

12:37.390 --> 12:41.126
In fact, I don't even
think I can be your friend.

12:41.128 --> 12:42.193
Kent, wait!

12:42.195 --> 12:43.461
We can totally be friends.

12:43.463 --> 12:45.063
We can go shopping together.

12:45.065 --> 12:47.198
And I like musicals.
I've even seen

12:47.200 --> 12:49.400
the latest Tony Award-winning
piece of crap.

Hey, Meg, what's wrong?

13:21.902 --> 13:24.102
What's wrong
is that Kent doesn't like me.

13:24.104 --> 13:25.670
He likes my brother, Chris.

13:25.672 --> 13:26.738
Oh, my God.

13:26.740 --> 13:27.839
No way!

13:27.841 --> 13:29.140
Well, I mean,

13:29.142 --> 13:30.341
you've done
everything you can do.

13:30.343 --> 13:32.177
I guess you just
have to move on.

13:32.179 --> 13:35.079
Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of
sweet guy-trim at this school.

13:35.081 --> 13:36.648
You-you don't understand.

13:36.650 --> 13:38.082
He's all I think about.

13:38.084 --> 13:39.784
I-I can't eat, I can't sleep.

13:39.786 --> 13:42.954
Just thinking about him now
gives me heart palpitations.

13:42.956 --> 13:44.455
(heart thumping)

13:44.457 --> 13:47.992
I feel like if I could just know
what it's like to be with him,

13:47.994 --> 13:49.661
just-just once,

13:49.663 --> 13:51.596
I could at least have
some sort of closure.

13:51.598 --> 13:53.364
Well, if Kent hooks up
with your brother,

13:53.366 --> 13:54.532
you could just have Chris

13:54.534 --> 13:56.034
describe every last detail
to you.

13:56.036 --> 13:58.269
Oh, my God, that's it.

13:58.271 --> 13:59.437
What do you mean?

13:59.439 --> 14:01.272
I mean,
if I can't have Kent,

14:01.274 --> 14:02.974
then that's
the next best thing.

14:02.976 --> 14:05.276
I've just got to get Chris
to sleep with him.

14:05.278 --> 14:06.678
Oh, no.

14:06.680 --> 14:08.046
Here comes
Mr. Davis with one

14:08.048 --> 14:10.648
of his technically-not-
illegal invitations.

14:10.650 --> 14:13.618
Girls, I'm gonna be
at the park later.

14:19.158 --> 14:21.492
Oh, I wouldn't worry
about it, Bonnie.

14:21.494 --> 14:23.528
I've put Stewie in the oven
a bunch of times.

14:23.530 --> 14:25.163
As long as you come
to your senses

14:25.165 --> 14:27.565
within 15 minutes,
everything's fine.

14:27.567 --> 14:29.701
Lois, can I go Slip 'N
Slide in the yard?

14:29.703 --> 14:31.502
Has it been half an hour
since you've eaten?

14:31.504 --> 14:32.704
Yes. Almost.

14:32.706 --> 14:35.173
Okay, I just want to be sure
you don't get a cramp.

14:35.175 --> 14:37.709
Yay! Poor people
water fun!

14:39.144 --> 14:40.645
Hey, Chris.

14:40.647 --> 14:42.714
Uh, can I ask you a question?

14:42.716 --> 14:44.048
Sure, what's up?

14:44.050 --> 14:46.684
Um, remember that "free hug"
coupon you gave me

14:46.686 --> 14:48.653
for my ninth birthday
that I never used?

14:48.655 --> 14:49.888
Yeah.

14:49.890 --> 14:52.156
Well, I'd like to use it.

14:52.158 --> 14:54.259
Oh, okay. Sure.

14:54.261 --> 14:57.729
But... I'd like
to sort of upgrade it.

14:57.731 --> 15:00.698
I'd like it
to be a butt-hug with Kent.

15:00.700 --> 15:02.600
What? Are you out
of your mind?!

15:02.602 --> 15:04.235
Chris, please,
just sleep with Kent

15:04.237 --> 15:05.837
and then tell me
all about it.

15:05.839 --> 15:06.838
Forget it, Meg.

15:06.840 --> 15:08.873
I can't just do stuff
with another guy.

15:08.875 --> 15:10.675
I'm not Derek Jeter.

15:10.677 --> 15:11.910
I like girls.

15:11.912 --> 15:13.177
Ugh, come on, Chris.

15:13.179 --> 15:14.279
Girls are terrible.

15:14.281 --> 15:15.513
They're always backstabbing

15:15.515 --> 15:17.682
and giving each other
phony compliments.

15:17.684 --> 15:20.885
Oh, wow, you are definitely
not afraid of dessert.

15:20.887 --> 15:22.720
You know, I wish I
were secure enough

15:22.722 --> 15:24.889
to throw on any old thing
and call it an outfit.

15:24.891 --> 15:27.859
Come on, you have
so much body confidence.

15:27.861 --> 15:30.695
I mean, who wouldn't
with those strong legs?

15:30.697 --> 15:32.230
So muscular.

15:32.232 --> 15:35.533
I'm jealous of how thick
with strength they are.

15:35.535 --> 15:36.634
Hey, I like your tie.

15:36.636 --> 15:37.635
Thanks.

15:37.637 --> 15:41.806
♪

15:41.808 --> 15:43.808
Come on, Chris,
he'll do all the work.

15:43.810 --> 15:45.076
I said no, Meg.

15:45.078 --> 15:46.611
I'll pay you
a hundred bucks.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.413
Oh, fine, I'll
keep it in my bum.

15:48.415 --> 15:49.881
There'll be
plenty of room.

15:49.883 --> 15:52.717
That's my sarcastic way of
saying it's not gonna happen.

15:52.719 --> 15:53.651
Good day, Meg.

15:53.653 --> 15:56.487
Oh, it's gonna happen.

16:01.727 --> 16:03.728
(doorbell rings)

16:03.730 --> 16:05.096
Oh, hi, Meg.

16:05.098 --> 16:06.297
Hi, Mr. Quagmire.

16:06.299 --> 16:07.632
What can I do for you?

16:07.634 --> 16:09.734
I-I was wondering
if I could borrow some roofies?

16:09.736 --> 16:11.970
Oh, sure, sure,
just a sec.

16:11.972 --> 16:13.471
Roofies, huh?

16:13.473 --> 16:15.306
Pretty big pill for
such a little girl.

16:15.308 --> 16:17.742
Yeah, I know, but I asked
someone to do me a favor,

16:17.744 --> 16:19.577
and they're not too keen
on doing it.

16:19.579 --> 16:20.945
Oh, I know what
they're for, honey.

16:20.947 --> 16:22.680
So, how's school?

16:22.682 --> 16:23.748
Oh, good, thanks.

16:23.750 --> 16:25.249
Studies going well?

16:25.251 --> 16:27.852
Yeah, yeah, mostly A's and B's
so far this semester.

16:27.854 --> 16:29.487
Oh, that's so great.

16:29.489 --> 16:31.456
Seeing anyone
special these days?

16:31.458 --> 16:33.257
Hey, obviously, right?

16:33.259 --> 16:35.026
(laughter)
Of course, yeah.

16:35.028 --> 16:36.661
Okay, well, listen, good
luck with everything.

16:36.663 --> 16:38.796
And, uh, call me
if you get arrested.

16:38.798 --> 16:40.999
I will. Thanks.

16:41.001 --> 16:42.700
That's what
it's all about, Glenn.

16:42.702 --> 16:45.103
Don't rape it back,
rape it forward.

16:49.875 --> 16:51.142
All right,
I talked to Chris,

16:51.144 --> 16:53.811
and he totally wants
to hook up with you, too.

16:53.813 --> 16:54.879
No way! Really?

16:54.881 --> 16:56.714
I didn't even
know he was gay.

16:56.716 --> 16:58.549
It's just that
he's not as comfortable

16:58.551 --> 17:00.284
with his sexuality
as you are yet,

17:00.286 --> 17:02.987
so he's gonna need
to pretend to be asleep

17:02.989 --> 17:04.222
while it's happening.

17:04.224 --> 17:05.890
Oh, he's a snooze-juicer.

17:05.892 --> 17:07.225
Okay.

17:07.227 --> 17:09.994
Wow, I didn't know Chris
had this dark side to him.

17:09.996 --> 17:12.830
Oh, yeah,
Chris has a major dark side.

17:12.832 --> 17:16.467
My dad is actually
really scared of him.

17:17.069 --> 17:19.871
(creaking)
Wha...

17:19.873 --> 17:21.406
Who's there?

17:21.408 --> 17:25.343
Go back to sleep, Dad.

17:25.345 --> 17:27.412
Okay.

17:30.649 --> 17:32.750
(whimpering)

17:34.853 --> 17:38.089
You're very
precious to me.

17:41.427 --> 17:43.227
Chris, I made
some Kool-Aid!

17:43.229 --> 17:44.595
You want some?

17:44.597 --> 17:45.997
Sure!

17:56.875 --> 17:58.776
Chris, what are you doing
in my room?

17:58.778 --> 18:00.378
Nothing.
Yes, you were.

18:00.380 --> 18:02.413
You were putting something
in my drawer.

18:02.415 --> 18:04.549
What's this?

18:04.551 --> 18:06.017
(sighs)
Look, Meg,

18:06.019 --> 18:07.852
I know you've been having
a hard time lately,

18:07.854 --> 18:10.254
so I wanted
to give you something

18:10.256 --> 18:13.091
that means a lot to me.

18:13.093 --> 18:15.193
Oh, I remember this.

18:15.195 --> 18:17.528
This was the trip
our family took to the Cape.

18:17.530 --> 18:18.763
Ugh, it was miserable.

18:18.765 --> 18:21.399
It was raining, and Mom and
Dad fought the whole time.

18:21.401 --> 18:22.934
You taught me how
to hunt squirrels

18:22.936 --> 18:23.935
with poisoned cheese,

18:23.937 --> 18:25.470
and then you took me
to the hospital

18:25.472 --> 18:27.939
when the squirrels tricked me
into eating the cheese.

18:27.941 --> 18:31.375
Chris, you kept this photo
all these years?

18:31.377 --> 18:33.878
Yeah, it's gotten me
through a lot of tough times.

18:33.880 --> 18:36.114
Like when Felicity
cut her hair.

18:36.116 --> 18:37.949
What?!

18:37.951 --> 18:40.418
Aw, thanks, Chris.

18:40.420 --> 18:42.053
That was really
thoughtful of you.

18:42.055 --> 18:44.922
Hey, so can I have
some of that Kool-Aid now?

18:44.924 --> 18:46.124
No.

18:46.126 --> 18:48.192
No, actually you can't.

19:04.910 --> 19:06.611
Oh, Chris, hi.

19:06.613 --> 19:08.112
I didn't realize
you'd be awake.

19:08.114 --> 19:09.413
What?

19:09.415 --> 19:11.983
Well, Meg said you'd be asleep,
but it's fine.

19:11.985 --> 19:12.917
I can work with this.

19:12.919 --> 19:14.619
Oh, hell no!

19:14.621 --> 19:15.853
Meg!

19:15.855 --> 19:17.922
Oh, my God.

19:17.924 --> 19:19.991
Kent, I just texted you
that the plan was off.

19:19.993 --> 19:22.927
Meg, what the hell
were you planning on doing?!

19:22.929 --> 19:24.862
Oh, Chris,
I'm so sorry.

19:24.864 --> 19:26.430
I was so obsessed
with Kent

19:26.432 --> 19:28.132
that I-I guess I wasn't
thinking straight.

19:28.134 --> 19:31.302
I'm just glad I stopped before
I did a really terrible thing.

19:31.304 --> 19:33.804
Terrible thing?
What terrible thing?

19:33.806 --> 19:37.008
Well, like I said,
I-I changed my mind.

19:37.010 --> 19:38.342
I-I didn't do it.

19:38.344 --> 19:39.677
But, um...

19:39.679 --> 19:40.978
I was...

19:40.980 --> 19:42.947
kind of gonna...

19:42.949 --> 19:43.848
roofie you.

19:43.850 --> 19:45.983
What?!
What is wrong with you?!

19:45.985 --> 19:48.553
And, Kent, I owe you
an apology, too.

19:48.555 --> 19:51.155
I lied when I told you that
Chris wanted to sleep with you.

19:51.157 --> 19:52.290
Save it, Meg!

19:52.292 --> 19:53.691
I don't need your apologies!

19:53.693 --> 19:56.194
I can see now
that you're a complete psycho!

19:59.231 --> 20:02.066
Boy, clothes sure are a prison,
aren't they?

20:04.303 --> 20:06.637
Lot of drumroll for nothing.

20:06.639 --> 20:08.005
What's this?

20:08.007 --> 20:10.074
Ooh, candy!

20:21.086 --> 20:21.919
Hey, Meg.

20:21.921 --> 20:23.321
I heard what happened.

20:23.323 --> 20:25.423
Yeah, Kent hates me now.

20:25.425 --> 20:27.024
You made a mistake.

20:27.026 --> 20:28.159
I know you feel terrible,

20:28.161 --> 20:29.894
but you're not
a bad person, Meg.

20:29.896 --> 20:31.529
You just need
to get back out there,

20:31.531 --> 20:33.664
and someday,
maybe you'll find the right guy.

20:33.666 --> 20:35.233
You really
think so, Brian?

20:35.235 --> 20:36.767
I know so.

20:36.769 --> 20:38.936
All it takes is one guy
making one mistake,

20:38.938 --> 20:40.271
one drunken night.

20:40.273 --> 20:41.539
Sperm finding a fertile egg.

20:41.541 --> 20:43.274
You refusing to do
what a sane woman would do.

20:43.276 --> 20:47.278
You got him, Meg.
You got him for life.

20:47.280 --> 20:49.847
Thanks, Brian.
No problem.

20:49.849 --> 20:52.516
Hey, do either of you know
what poison ivy looks like?
