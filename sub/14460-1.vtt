03:12.150 --> 03:16.070
EVOLUTION

05:28.150 --> 05:29.250
Nicolas!

05:50.950 --> 05:53.350
- There's a dead boy!
- Did you go out?

05:53.550 --> 05:55.250
He's underwater.

05:55.450 --> 05:56.550
Have you been swimming?

05:57.850 --> 05:59.350
His eyes are horrible!

05:59.350 --> 06:01.250
The sea makes you think
all kinds of things.

06:06.150 --> 06:09.850
Don't do it again,
you could have drowned.

06:13.050 --> 06:15.050
There was a star on his belly.

06:16.050 --> 06:17.250
A starfish?

06:17.350 --> 06:19.250
Yes, a red one, this big.

06:46.050 --> 06:47.150
Nicolas!

06:56.950 --> 06:59.050
We're going to bury it.
Coming?

07:01.150 --> 07:02.250
I saw a dead body.

07:03.350 --> 07:04.250
It's in the water.

07:05.050 --> 07:06.150
Where in the water?

07:06.350 --> 07:07.150
In the sea.

07:07.350 --> 07:08.250
Liar!

07:14.150 --> 07:15.150
He's scared!

07:18.150 --> 07:20.050
We'll bury it here.

09:00.750 --> 09:01.950
Time for your medicine.

09:16.750 --> 09:17.750
One,

09:18.050 --> 09:19.150
two,

09:19.450 --> 09:20.250
three,

09:20.950 --> 09:22.250
four.

09:30.750 --> 09:32.250
Why am I sick?

09:32.650 --> 09:34.950
Because at your age
your body is changing

09:35.150 --> 09:36.050
and weakening.

09:36.650 --> 09:38.050
Like lizards?

09:38.750 --> 09:40.250
In a way.

09:40.950 --> 09:43.050
Like lizards or crabs.

09:43.250 --> 09:45.450
When they molt, they're very fragile.

09:52.350 --> 09:53.650
And starfish?

09:54.950 --> 09:57.150
They only change once, at birth.

09:57.950 --> 09:59.150
And afterwards?

09:59.950 --> 10:01.150
Afterwards...

10:02.750 --> 10:04.950
A new cycle begins.

10:05.150 --> 10:06.150
A new life.

10:08.550 --> 10:10.050
Drink up.

10:39.550 --> 10:41.950
You frightened me before.

10:48.850 --> 10:50.950
Where did you go swimming?

11:39.650 --> 11:41.350
There never was any drowned boy.

13:32.850 --> 13:33.950
Nicolas!

15:08.950 --> 15:10.850
You're a good boy.

19:31.650 --> 19:32.650
Nicolas!

19:52.950 --> 19:54.950
See its mouth? It's scary.

20:02.950 --> 20:04.550
You're scared of this?

20:04.750 --> 20:06.050
Coward!

20:13.350 --> 20:14.350
Frank!

20:16.850 --> 20:18.250
Stop that!

20:23.850 --> 20:24.850
Coward!

23:17.950 --> 23:20.250
You'll stay here overnight.

23:20.850 --> 23:22.050
It won't be long.

23:47.850 --> 23:50.050
What will you do to me?

23:50.250 --> 23:51.050
An injection.

23:51.350 --> 23:54.050
It's nothing for a big boy like you.

23:59.250 --> 24:01.250
Your mother tells me you draw a lot.

24:02.650 --> 24:03.650
Yes.

24:17.750 --> 24:19.050
What do you draw?

24:24.750 --> 24:25.950
Animals.

24:28.650 --> 24:29.850
Starfish.

25:13.850 --> 25:15.750
Am I going to die?

25:28.750 --> 25:30.550
Hang your clothes there.

25:34.650 --> 25:37.050
You can't shower dressed.

25:37.850 --> 25:39.750
I can do it myself.
66.

25:39.850 --> 25:41.850
It'll be more fun together.

25:48.350 --> 25:49.450
Come on!

26:00.150 --> 26:01.350
What's that?

26:05.750 --> 26:07.750
I'd love to see your drawings.

26:11.750 --> 26:13.850
I can keep a secret.

26:20.650 --> 26:21.750
Thank you.

26:47.050 --> 26:48.150
It's beautiful.

27:00.250 --> 27:02.750
I'll count 10 and it'll be over.

27:05.850 --> 27:06.950
One,

27:13.050 --> 27:14.150
two,

27:22.550 --> 27:23.750
Three,

27:34.750 --> 27:35.750
four,

27:40.750 --> 27:41.750
five,

27:44.650 --> 27:45.650
six,

27:49.950 --> 27:50.950
seven,

28:00.050 --> 28:01.050
eight,

28:04.050 --> 28:05.050
nine,

28:08.050 --> 28:08.950
Ten.

30:53.850 --> 30:55.850
Look, what they did to me.

30:57.550 --> 30:59.250
They did it to us all.

31:04.550 --> 31:05.850
Are we all sick?

32:02.450 --> 32:03.650
Where are you going?

32:04.350 --> 32:06.750
Don't you want to come home?

33:46.750 --> 33:47.750
Victor!

33:55.650 --> 33:56.850
Victor!

33:58.350 --> 33:59.550
Victor!

34:06.550 --> 34:07.750
Are you coming?

34:07.950 --> 34:10.150
- Where?
- They're lying to us.

34:10.350 --> 34:12.250
Let's see what they do at night.

34:37.750 --> 34:38.949
Are you coming?

35:07.850 --> 35:09.150
We're going to get lost.

35:09.350 --> 35:11.050
No, we're not.
Come on!

41:33.350 --> 41:34.950
How long do we have to stay here?

42:01.950 --> 42:03.250
They're lying.

42:05.850 --> 42:07.850
We won't get better.

44:40.850 --> 44:42.850
Where's Victor?

44:57.750 --> 44:59.850
Look what I have for you.

45:32.950 --> 45:34.850
What's that?

45:35.050 --> 45:36.850
A Ferris wheel.

45:42.850 --> 45:44.750
And what does this wheel do?

45:45.350 --> 45:47.150
You get on it

45:47.350 --> 45:49.350
and it spins around.

46:36.850 --> 46:38.150
Children!

46:38.250 --> 46:40.150
I have good news.

46:40.350 --> 46:43.050
Your friend Victor has been cured.

46:43.750 --> 46:45.950
He sent you this.

47:10.950 --> 47:11.950
More!

47:16.750 --> 47:17.850
What are you doing?

47:18.050 --> 47:20.050
Do you want them to force-feed you?

47:25.850 --> 47:27.150
Give me that!

47:28.750 --> 47:29.750
Give me that!

47:35.050 --> 47:36.150
Get back into bed!

47:36.350 --> 47:37.850
Obey me!

47:38.350 --> 47:39.550
Obey your mother!

47:39.650 --> 47:41.450
You're not my mother!

51:00.950 --> 51:01.850
Nicolas...

51:05.650 --> 51:06.950
Nicolas!

51:24.750 --> 51:26.150
They took them all.

52:05.350 --> 52:06.350
You know,

52:06.550 --> 52:08.950
my mother's not my mother either.

54:57.750 --> 54:58.750
Here.

55:03.650 --> 55:04.950
Shall we draw?

55:35.950 --> 55:37.350
You don't draw?

55:43.750 --> 55:45.650
Show me.

55:51.650 --> 55:53.350
Draw something.

58:32.750 --> 58:34.750
Shall I tell you a secret?

58:36.850 --> 58:37.850
Yes.

01:06:04.650 --> 01:06:06.150
Can you feel it?

01:06:11.750 --> 01:06:12.750
Yes.

01:07:21.950 --> 01:07:23.050
Here he is!

01:16:57.850 --> 01:16:58.950
Stella!

01:17:03.750 --> 01:17:04.950
Come back!

01:17:08.750 --> 01:17:10.050
Stella!
