00:14.514 --> 00:16.599
Excuse me.

00:19.811 --> 00:20.979
{\an3}(grunts)

00:21.062 --> 00:22.147
{\an3}Let's roll.

00:22.230 --> 00:24.065
Our favorite weatherman says
there's gonna be some snow

00:24.149 --> 00:25.066
in West Hollywood.

00:25.150 --> 00:27.110
{\an1}Would you mind dropping me
off at the Peach Pit?

00:27.193 --> 00:28.737
{\an1}I told my mom
I would meet her there.

00:28.820 --> 00:30.280
{\an3}I'm already 20 minutes
late, Kelly.

00:30.363 --> 00:32.073
It'll just take a minute.

00:32.156 --> 00:33.450
{\an1}She's worried about me
all right?

00:33.533 --> 00:35.076
{\an3}Well, I'm worried about
us getting some blow.

00:35.160 --> 00:37.120
{\an3}Look, if we stand
up Danny Five,

00:37.203 --> 00:39.956
{\an3}we're out of luck for
the whole weekend.

00:40.039 --> 00:43.918
I promised her
I would be there.

00:44.002 --> 00:46.921
{\an3}Fine. Fine.

00:47.005 --> 00:49.424
Just don't come crying to me
when you're coming down.

00:49.507 --> 00:51.593
(engine starting)

01:08.193 --> 01:09.986
Hey.

01:10.069 --> 01:11.988
what's the powwow?

01:12.071 --> 01:13.990
{\an3}Kelly.

01:14.073 --> 01:15.992
Well, there's nothing
they can do about her.

01:16.075 --> 01:17.827
{\an1}Some people just
have to hit bottom

01:17.911 --> 01:19.996
before they realize
their life's a mess.

01:20.079 --> 01:21.998
{\an3}Hmm. Yeah, I guess
you're right about that.

01:22.081 --> 01:25.001
But you do need to give
people a chance, right?

01:25.084 --> 01:26.836
{\an1}Is that what you're doing
with Jonathan?

01:26.920 --> 01:28.338
Giving him another chance?

01:28.421 --> 01:30.340
No.

01:30.423 --> 01:32.342
No.

01:32.425 --> 01:33.885
{\an3}I'm just glad
Brandon forgave me.

01:33.968 --> 01:35.512
{\an1}Think Jonathan
got the picture?

01:35.595 --> 01:37.055
I don't know.

01:37.138 --> 01:39.098
{\an3}I hope so.

01:39.182 --> 01:41.559
{\an1}Maybe he just needs another
woman to distract him.

01:41.643 --> 01:42.936
Please.

01:43.019 --> 01:44.354
Got anyone in mind?

01:44.437 --> 01:45.897
Actually, I do.

01:45.980 --> 01:48.191
{\an1}I have an old friend of mine,
just came into town.

01:48.274 --> 01:50.193
{\an3}Really?
What's her name?

01:50.276 --> 01:52.195
Ginger.

01:52.278 --> 01:55.198
{\an5}JACKIE:
Why did you wait so long
to tell me?

01:55.281 --> 01:57.033
No, no, no, no, no.

01:57.116 --> 01:59.035
{\an3}Why did I wait
so long to notice?

01:59.118 --> 02:01.037
{\an3}Okay, what are we
going to do about it?

02:01.120 --> 02:03.081
Well, Colin isn't exactly
the best influence on her.

02:03.164 --> 02:05.375
{\an3}Obviously, they
both have a problem.

02:05.458 --> 02:06.376
But I know my daughter.

02:06.459 --> 02:07.585
{\an3}And if we try to
separate them,

02:07.669 --> 02:09.086
it'll just make
matters worse.

02:09.169 --> 02:11.214
At least she said
she's only using on weekends.

02:11.297 --> 02:13.216
AndJACKIE: All right,y?

02:13.299 --> 02:14.551
she's on her way.

02:14.634 --> 02:16.553
When she gets here,
we'll just discuss it.

02:16.636 --> 02:18.513
I think she'll listen to us.

02:20.974 --> 02:22.851
{\an1}Excuse me,
Kelly just called.

02:22.934 --> 02:24.894
She said she's not gonna be able
to meet you after all.

02:24.978 --> 02:27.647
{\an1}But she'll call you
later, okay?

{\an3}GreetinHi.

04:34.607 --> 04:36.526
Nice to meet you.

04:36.609 --> 04:37.819
I've heard a lot about you.

04:37.902 --> 04:40.071
Yeah, right, none of
it is probably true.

04:40.154 --> 04:42.532
{\an3}So, look, whatever
you need,

04:42.615 --> 04:43.533
I'm here, all right?

04:43.616 --> 04:44.867
{\an3}That goes for you
too, Kelly.

04:44.951 --> 04:46.327
{\an3}Great.

04:46.411 --> 04:47.704
Maybe we should hang out
sometime.

04:47.787 --> 04:49.205
All right,.

04:49.288 --> 04:50.373
but I gotta run.

04:50.456 --> 04:52.208
Uh-- oh, and Colin,

04:52.291 --> 04:53.251
I'd appreciate it
if you didn't, uh, you know,

04:53.334 --> 04:55.545
pass my number around
unless it was someone, uh,

04:55.628 --> 04:56.713
you know, really discreet.

04:56.796 --> 04:57.714
No problem.

04:57.797 --> 05:00.008
All right, man,
have a good one.

05:00.091 --> 05:02.010
Nice guy, huh?

05:02.093 --> 05:04.053
Yeah, yeah.

05:04.137 --> 05:07.223
{\an3}So, want me to take you
to the Peach Pit now?

05:07.306 --> 05:08.558
Uh, no, no, no,
it's too late.

05:08.641 --> 05:10.059
I'll explain to her later.

05:10.143 --> 05:12.603
{\an1}I want you
to take me home.

05:18.651 --> 05:19.569
DONNA:
Thanks for coming.

05:19.652 --> 05:20.570
I just wanted to remind you

05:20.653 --> 05:22.780
that the Alpha's Valentine's Day
Pajama Party

05:22.864 --> 05:24.574
will begin 8:00 Friday night

05:24.657 --> 05:26.576
and go through breakfast
the next morning.

05:26.659 --> 05:27.910
Hey, what's this
"sex out" thing?

05:27.994 --> 05:29.078
DONNA:
Well, it's, uh,

05:29.162 --> 05:30.788
kind of like the
Great American Smokeout,

05:30.872 --> 05:32.415
except instead
of not smoking,

05:32.498 --> 05:33.583
we are asking people

05:33.666 --> 05:36.044
to take a vow of celibacy
for 24 hours.

05:36.127 --> 05:38.588
Now it's strictly voluntary
of course,

05:38.671 --> 05:40.423
but we are trying
to bring awareness

05:40.506 --> 05:42.258
to safe sex and abstinence.

05:42.341 --> 05:43.801
FRAT GUY: Exactly
what do you mean

05:43.885 --> 05:45.762
{\an3}by abstinence?
Is kissing allowed?

05:45.845 --> 05:47.597
Sure, kissing, dancing--

05:47.680 --> 05:49.974
anything you can do
from the neck up is okay.

05:50.058 --> 05:51.976
{\an3}Well, uh, you can
count me out.

05:52.060 --> 05:53.978
(crowd booing)

05:54.062 --> 05:55.271
Guys, guys.

05:55.354 --> 05:57.440
This is a pajama party.

{\an5}STEVE:
satin nighties,
see-through nightgowns.

06:02.653 --> 06:04.405
How bad can it be?

06:04.489 --> 06:06.616
{\an3}Think of it as 24 hours
of foreplay, right?

06:06.699 --> 06:08.493
{\an3}Give me one of those
pledge cards.

06:09.827 --> 06:10.745
{\an3}Thank you.

06:10.828 --> 06:11.871
Here you go, Donna.

06:11.954 --> 06:14.916

How can you make
a pledge

06:25.718 --> 06:27.261
you have absolutely
no ability to keep?

06:27.345 --> 06:28.513
{\an3}What are you
talking about?

06:28.596 --> 06:29.680
I've got plenty
of self-control.

06:29.764 --> 06:31.099
Really?

06:31.182 --> 06:33.101
{\an1}When has Mr. Instant
Gratification

06:33.184 --> 06:34.977
{\an1}ever denied himself
anything?

06:35.061 --> 06:37.522
Okay, in eighth grade,

06:37.605 --> 06:39.440

{\an3}It's a bet you're
gonna lose.

06:48.116 --> 06:49.659
I And why's that?

06:49.742 --> 06:51.994
Because...

06:52.078 --> 06:55.039
I'm not signing the pledge.

06:55.123 --> 06:56.707
{\an3}Okay, well, you take
your best shot,

06:56.791 --> 06:58.376

clears throat):
Arnold.

06:58.459 --> 07:00.419

Thanks.tfit.

07:06.592 --> 07:07.760
You bought it for me.

07:07.844 --> 07:09.345
How much was it?

07:09.428 --> 07:10.596
Oh, you know me.

07:10.680 --> 07:12.598
I never look at
the price tag.

07:12.682 --> 07:14.392
Oh, how considerate.

07:14.475 --> 07:16.185
{\an3}This Jonathan
better be cute.

07:16.269 --> 07:18.187
{\an3}I mean as cute
as David.

07:18.271 --> 07:19.522
{\an1}Well, take a look
for yourself.

07:19.605 --> 07:21.023
He's right over there.

07:24.110 --> 07:26.028
{\an3}Not bad.

07:26.112 --> 07:28.030
{\an1}He travels
all over the world.

07:28.114 --> 07:30.032
Makes a lot of money.

07:30.116 --> 07:32.160
{\an1}He's definitely
a good catch.

07:33.119 --> 07:35.163
{\an1}Sit here
and I'll be right back.

07:39.458 --> 07:41.377
(clears throat)

07:41.460 --> 07:44.213
Oh, Jonathan, I'm glad
you could make it.

07:44.297 --> 07:46.215
Um, that's Ginger
right over there.

07:46.299 --> 07:48.217
Wow, she is cute.

07:48.301 --> 07:50.219
Well, she's, uh,
more than cute.

07:50.303 --> 07:52.221
She's available.

07:52.305 --> 07:54.015
{\an1}What do you mean
available?

07:54.098 --> 07:55.558
Well, let's see.
How do I put it?

07:55.641 --> 07:57.351
Um... she's easy.

07:57.435 --> 07:58.895
She's very easy.

07:58.978 --> 08:00.563
{\an3}Come on.

08:00.646 --> 08:02.565
(chuckles)

08:02.648 --> 08:04.567
(clears throat)

08:04.650 --> 08:06.569
Uh, Jonathan,
this is Ginger.

08:06.652 --> 08:08.029
Ginger, this is Jonathan.

08:08.112 --> 08:09.697
{\an3}It's nice to meet
you, Ginger.

08:09.780 --> 08:11.449
{\an3}You are just as beautiful
as Valerie said.

08:11.532 --> 08:12.700
Thank you.

08:12.783 --> 08:14.493
You're not so bad yourself.

08:14.577 --> 08:17.955
So, I guess you know
Brandon and the gang.

08:18.039 --> 08:21.042
{\an3}Yeah, yeah,
I do, but, uh,

08:21.125 --> 08:22.585
{\an3}actually they-they
can't stand me.

08:22.668 --> 08:23.586
GINGER:
Really?

08:23.669 --> 08:24.462
(laughs)

08:24.545 --> 08:26.756
Looks like we have something
in common.

08:26.839 --> 08:28.883
{\an3}So, Val,

08:28.966 --> 08:30.927
{\an3}you gonna join us
for lunch or...

08:31.010 --> 08:32.428
{\an6}VALERIE:
I don't think so.
I think the two of you

08:32.510 --> 08:33.471
{\an3}will just be fine
without me.

08:33.554 --> 08:35.472
{\an3}All right,
well, sit down.

08:35.556 --> 08:37.975
Okay.

08:44.357 --> 08:46.734
Will you get away
from me?

08:46.817 --> 08:48.277
{\an1}You are such
a little pest.

08:48.361 --> 08:50.404
{\an3}Come on, I'm just trying
to get a little action

08:50.488 --> 08:51.322
before the deadline.

08:51.405 --> 08:52.949
{\an4}CLARE:
Yeah, well, you can
forget it, okay?

08:53.032 --> 08:54.784
{\an1}'Cause I'm in the business
of increasing my odds.

08:54.867 --> 08:56.077
That's not fair.

08:56.160 --> 08:57.411
{\an3}You're rigging
your bet.

08:57.495 --> 08:58.496
Fair to whom?

08:58.579 --> 09:00.122
Fair to me, Clare.

09:00.206 --> 09:02.124
Yeah, well, no way, bud.

09:02.208 --> 09:04.377
{\an1}I want you down
on your hands and knees

09:04.460 --> 09:06.337
begging for something
you're not gonna get.

09:06.420 --> 09:07.922
{\an3}You'll do anything
to win, I'm convinced.

09:08.005 --> 09:10.007
{\an1}CLARE:
Clare, um,

09:10.091 --> 09:12.009
{\an3}could I get in on
thisMe, too.

09:12.093 --> 09:13.678
It looks like a sure thing.

09:13.761 --> 09:15.304
{\an3}Will you guys stop
encouraging her, please?

09:15.388 --> 09:16.347
Steve, you have

09:16.430 --> 09:17.765
{\an3}no one to blame
but yourself.

{\an5}SUSAN:
Speak for yourself,
dear.

09:23.020 --> 09:24.105
{\an3}You didn't.

09:24.188 --> 09:25.481
I did.

09:25.564 --> 09:27.066
{\an1}Happy Valentine's Day,
precious. (smacking lips)

Hey, pal, cold shower.

09:29.694 --> 09:30.695
It works.

09:30.778 --> 09:32.488

it'll work for you.

09:37.285 --> 09:38.869

09:40.121 --> 09:41.497
Mm, cool by me.

09:41.580 --> 09:42.707
Kelly, hear that?

09:42.790 --> 09:44.166
Yeah, that's great.

09:44.250 --> 09:45.501
{\an3}Do you guys want
another beer?

09:45.584 --> 09:47.336
Yeah, me, too.

{\an3}How about
you, babe?

09:52.174 --> 09:53.050
Mm, I'm fine.

09:53.134 --> 09:54.218
Want another bump?

09:54.302 --> 09:55.344
Are you kidding?

09:55.428 --> 09:56.679
I'm already flying.

09:57.638 --> 09:59.557
(doorbell buzzing)

09:59.640 --> 10:02.518
Oh, um, I'll get it.

10:02.601 --> 10:04.603
{\an1}KELLY:
Coming.

10:11.110 --> 10:12.486
{\an1}Hi.

10:12.570 --> 10:14.697
{\an3}Hey, I, uh, brought
your mail over.

10:14.780 --> 10:16.490
Um...

10:17.616 --> 10:19.577
We'll be outside on the deck.
Come on.

10:21.787 --> 10:23.831
Come on in.

10:26.125 --> 10:28.544
Uh, there's a-a letter
in here from your dad.

10:28.627 --> 10:30.546
If you want,
I could stay with you

10:30.629 --> 10:32.089
while you open it.

10:32.173 --> 10:34.091
No. No, I'm fine.

10:34.175 --> 10:35.593
Did you talk
to your mom?

10:35.676 --> 10:36.802
{\an3}'Cause she called
this morning.

10:36.886 --> 10:38.721
She said you were supposed
to meet her at the Peach Pit.

10:38.804 --> 10:40.222
Oh, yeah, I know.

10:40.306 --> 10:43.642
Um, I spent the whole morning
apologizing to her.

10:47.104 --> 10:49.940
{\an3}Come home, Kel,
please.

10:50.024 --> 10:52.401
{\an3}I mean you don't
belong here.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.570
Why don't you come with me
to the Alpha party tomorrow.

10:54.653 --> 10:56.405
{\an3}You know, have some fun.
Be with your friends.

10:56.489 --> 10:58.407
I am with my friends,

10:58.491 --> 11:00.868
and I'm having a great time.

11:00.951 --> 11:03.829
{\an3}You sure this is
what you really want?

11:04.872 --> 11:07.083
Yeah.

11:11.003 --> 11:13.589
Well, if there's ever
anything you need,

11:13.673 --> 11:14.924
you know I'm always
here for you.

11:15.966 --> 11:18.094
I know.

11:19.637 --> 11:20.930
You know I love you.

11:21.972 --> 11:24.600
I love you, too.

11:29.814 --> 11:31.607
Well, I-I guess
I'd better get going

11:31.690 --> 11:33.067
and let you get back
to your friends.

11:33.150 --> 11:34.777
{\an1}Yeah, that's
probably a good idea.

11:34.860 --> 11:37.071
Yeah.

11:37.154 --> 11:40.199
Well, have fun at your,
um, party.

11:45.162 --> 11:47.123
Bye, Kel.

11:47.206 --> 11:48.207
Bye.

12:26.579 --> 12:28.998
Happy Valentine's Day.

12:29.081 --> 12:31.500
{\an3}Mmm... hi.

12:31.584 --> 12:33.502
What's this?

12:33.586 --> 12:35.004
Breakfast in bed,
cafeteria style.

12:35.087 --> 12:37.173
We have an egg muffin,

12:37.256 --> 12:40.676
orange juice, and of course,
instant oatmeal.

12:40.759 --> 12:42.136
(chuckles)

12:42.219 --> 12:43.846
That is so sweet.

12:43.929 --> 12:45.598
Happy Valentine's Day.

12:46.724 --> 12:48.601
There's a card
for you there, too.

12:48.684 --> 12:50.686
I see.

12:53.606 --> 12:55.608
What's this?

12:56.775 --> 12:58.527
It's a poem I wrote for you.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.029
Really?

13:00.112 --> 13:01.322
Yes.

13:01.405 --> 13:03.782
Will you read it to me?

13:05.242 --> 13:07.244
Sure.

13:08.913 --> 13:10.956
(clears throat)

13:13.792 --> 13:16.545
"As fingertips feel
the sensation to weep,

13:16.629 --> 13:19.423
"And wax-melted candles reflect
in your sleep.

13:19.507 --> 13:22.009
"A beauty that forces
the pain to retreat,

13:22.092 --> 13:25.846
"Even though the waves
can keep breaking.

13:25.930 --> 13:28.516
"The power of destiny
pulls like a rage.

13:28.599 --> 13:31.727
"The touch of your lips
hides the beast in the cage.

13:31.810 --> 13:34.980
"For love, as does wine,
gets better with age.

13:35.064 --> 13:37.691
"My heart is the one
that you're taking.

13:37.775 --> 13:40.861
"I hope and pray
as the years run away,

13:40.945 --> 13:43.697
"And hourglass sands
stand still as I say,

13:43.781 --> 13:47.535
"I love you a little bit more
every day.

13:47.618 --> 13:49.537
You're the half of my whole,
no mistaking."

13:49.620 --> 13:52.081
That was so beautiful.

13:52.164 --> 13:54.083
Thanks.

13:54.166 --> 13:56.627
Well, I have something for you.

13:59.797 --> 14:01.340
{\an3}(giggles)

14:01.423 --> 14:02.925
Okay.

14:04.385 --> 14:06.887
Ah, a bracelet.

14:06.971 --> 14:08.222
No, a friendship bracelet.

14:08.305 --> 14:09.557
Come here.

14:14.812 --> 14:17.106
I've had many men in my life,

14:17.189 --> 14:20.401
but you're the only one
who's been my friend.

14:24.572 --> 14:26.699
Will you be my Valentine?

14:29.201 --> 14:30.786
Let me think about that.

14:30.869 --> 14:32.663
(both laugh)

14:32.746 --> 14:34.123
Ah, what the hell.

14:40.879 --> 14:42.965
Hey, good-lookin'.

14:43.048 --> 14:45.467
Check this out.

14:45.551 --> 14:47.261
{\an1}Nice.

14:47.344 --> 14:48.679
Is that foSure.

14:48.762 --> 14:50.514
Ten smackeroos.

14:50.598 --> 14:52.016
That's a good deal.

14:52.099 --> 14:54.310
{\an1}Yeah, it's for
Good.IDS charities.

14:54.393 --> 14:56.687
I have to go see the coach.

14:56.770 --> 14:57.813
{\an3}What's up?

14:57.896 --> 14:59.189
Nothing really,

14:59.273 --> 15:01.692
{\an1}except for all this
medical stuff; I just want

15:01.775 --> 15:02.985
to thank him
for being behind me.

15:03.068 --> 15:04.695
Well, wish him
a Happy Valentine's Day for me.

15:04.778 --> 15:06.322
I will.

15:06.405 --> 15:08.157
{\an1}See ya.

15:08.240 --> 15:09.658
Your T-shirt.

15:09.742 --> 15:11.327
Yeah.hanks.

15:22.254 --> 15:24.298
{\an1}SUSAN:
Walsh, get in here!

15:27.926 --> 15:31.013
{\an3}I see you got
a visit from Cupid.

15:31.096 --> 15:33.098
Happy Valentine's Day.

15:34.767 --> 15:36.685
They're beautiful,
and so are you.

15:36.769 --> 15:38.020
Oh, thank you.

15:38.103 --> 15:39.855
{\an3}Does that mean I don't
have to go back to work?

15:39.938 --> 15:41.023
Not right now you don't.

15:41.106 --> 15:42.858
Good.

15:42.941 --> 15:44.777
Oh, wait.

15:47.613 --> 15:49.531
I have a present for you, too.

15:49.615 --> 15:51.325
Aha.

15:56.497 --> 15:58.207
Wow.

15:58.290 --> 16:01.210
{\an3}Woodward and Bernstein
signed letters.

16:01.293 --> 16:02.878
Well done, Keats.

16:02.961 --> 16:04.088
Not bad.

16:04.171 --> 16:05.381
"Not bad"?

16:05.464 --> 16:06.840
You know how hard these
were to get?

16:06.924 --> 16:08.550
Yes I do.

16:08.634 --> 16:10.219
Thank you.

16:13.806 --> 16:14.890
Susan Keats?

16:14.973 --> 16:17.726
These are for you.

16:17.810 --> 16:19.520
Where should I put them?

16:19.603 --> 16:21.397
{\an1}Uh, right there
is fine, thank you.

16:25.150 --> 16:27.778
I don't suppose I have
to ask who those are from, do I?

16:29.780 --> 16:31.782
No.

16:53.804 --> 16:56.098
Where's the coke, Kelly?

16:56.181 --> 16:59.268
I dIf it were in the box,ox.

16:59.351 --> 17:00.519
{\an3}I wouldn't be asking
now, would I?

17:00.602 --> 17:02.730
Maybe your friends
did it all last night.

17:15.909 --> 17:18.244
I can't believe you went through
a whole gram by yourself.

17:18.328 --> 17:20.204
Give me a break, would you?

17:24.877 --> 17:25.544
You know, you're really

17:25.627 --> 17:27.003
{\an3}a selfish bitch,
you know that?

17:27.087 --> 17:29.006
It was my money that bought it.

17:29.089 --> 17:30.632
That makes it my stash.

17:30.716 --> 17:32.468
Daddy's money.
You're not going to wrap me

17:32.551 --> 17:34.470
around your little finger
like you do your father.

17:34.553 --> 17:36.472
You don't know anything
about me or my dad.

17:36.555 --> 17:38.807
So wYou're right, I don't. up.

17:38.891 --> 17:39.683
And I don't care.

17:39.767 --> 17:41.602
{\an3}If you want more,
you score this time.

17:41.685 --> 17:43.312
{\an3}FiI'm done.

17:48.400 --> 17:49.943
I'm glad you came in.

17:50.027 --> 17:51.820
There is something
we have to talk about.

17:51.904 --> 17:53.822
Oh, yeah, what's that?

17:53.906 --> 17:56.700
{\an1}Joe, I don't want you
to take this the wrong way.

17:56.784 --> 17:58.660
You've been
a team player all along,

17:58.744 --> 18:01.705
and I'm counting on you
to always be a team player.

18:01.789 --> 18:02.498
Of course I am.

18:02.581 --> 18:05.334
You know how
I feelGood.t that.

18:05.417 --> 18:08.003
'Cause I've had to do
a little checking around.

18:08.086 --> 18:12.007
I can't go into next season
without strong support for you.

18:12.090 --> 18:13.509
Are you looking
for a quarterback?

18:13.592 --> 18:14.676
We've already got Mac.

18:14.760 --> 18:16.678
Mac's a good backup.

18:16.762 --> 18:19.139
So you're...

18:19.223 --> 18:20.849
you're looking for a starter?

18:20.933 --> 18:23.727
Well, you know how close we came
to the Rose Bowl this year.

18:23.811 --> 18:25.979
And I've got all my boys
coming back.

18:26.063 --> 18:27.856
{\an1}We've got
a good chance.

18:27.940 --> 18:30.692
{\an1}I've got to find
a starter to replace you

18:30.776 --> 18:32.027
because of your condition.

18:32.110 --> 18:33.529
Yeah, I guess you do.

18:33.612 --> 18:35.155
{\an1}It's for the good
of the team.

18:35.239 --> 18:37.199
I know that's the way
you'd want it.

18:43.956 --> 18:46.708
Well, uh...

18:46.792 --> 18:48.710
{\an3}thanks for giving me
the time, Coach.

18:48.794 --> 18:50.879
You bet, Joe.

18:50.963 --> 18:52.714
You know I'm here.

18:52.798 --> 18:54.758
Anything you need.

18:57.803 --> 18:59.805
Yeah.

19:28.959 --> 19:30.878
(door unlocking)

19:30.961 --> 19:32.963
Kelly, come on in.

19:38.010 --> 19:40.345
{\an3}I didn't expect
to see you so soon.

19:40.429 --> 19:42.890
Make yourself at home.

19:42.973 --> 19:45.100
<i>Mi casa es su casa,</i> eh?

19:45.183 --> 19:46.602
What can I do for?

19:46.685 --> 19:49.855
Um, I was hoping
to get a couple of grams.

19:49.938 --> 19:51.607
A Uh-huh.Gs?

19:51.690 --> 19:53.275
Why don't you get an eight
ball? It's a lot cheaper.

19:53.358 --> 19:55.485
{\an3}OAll right.

19:55.569 --> 19:56.820
Here, have a seat.

19:56.904 --> 19:58.697
And by the way,
help yourself.

19:58.780 --> 20:00.198
I'll be right back.

20:03.785 --> 20:05.829
Hi.

20:13.754 --> 20:16.673
This stuff is amazing.

20:16.757 --> 20:18.884
My name's Sherry.

20:18.967 --> 20:20.969
{\an3}I'm Kelly.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.971
Yeah, I know.

20:23.055 --> 20:24.848
Oh, girls.

20:24.932 --> 20:27.017
Come on, Sher,
I'm waiting for you.

20:27.100 --> 20:28.810
C-Can I do another?

20:28.894 --> 20:30.979
Yeah, yeah, knock yourself out.

20:31.063 --> 20:32.439
You...

20:34.232 --> 20:36.777
I'll wait for you
in the bedroom.

20:37.736 --> 20:39.655
It was nice to meet you.

20:39.738 --> 20:41.615
You, too.

20:43.742 --> 20:46.328
HOh, thanks.

20:46.411 --> 20:48.330
How much doHey, relax.

20:48.413 --> 20:49.665
There's always time
to take care of business.

20:49.748 --> 20:52.668
Check this out.

20:52.751 --> 20:54.336
Pure pharmaceutical.

20:54.419 --> 20:55.671
Believe me, Kelly.

20:55.754 --> 20:57.965
{\an1}You've never done
anything like this.

20:58.048 --> 21:00.342
This is my own private reserve.

21:00.425 --> 21:02.427
It's not even for sale.

21:04.096 --> 21:06.139
Check it out.

21:12.396 --> 21:14.398
Yeah, yeah.

21:18.902 --> 21:20.904
(dance music playing)

21:45.804 --> 21:47.556
{\an3}Clare, cut it out.
I told you.

21:47.639 --> 21:48.724
I'm temporarily celibate.

21:48.807 --> 21:49.725
Stop touching me!

21:49.808 --> 21:51.560
CLARE:
You know what?

21:51.643 --> 21:53.729
{\an3}I keep thinking about
the dressing room upstairs

21:53.812 --> 21:55.439
where we first made love.

21:55.522 --> 21:57.524
Remember how
good it felt?

21:59.943 --> 22:02.195
I'm not listening to you.

22:02.279 --> 22:04.823
{\an3}Fine, but you can
still see me.

22:12.414 --> 22:14.416
(muttering)

22:16.168 --> 22:18.086
Oh...

22:18.170 --> 22:20.088
Not anymore.

22:20.172 --> 22:21.548
(sniffs)

22:21.631 --> 22:23.050
(exhales)

22:24.676 --> 22:26.303
What are they doing here?

22:26.386 --> 22:28.388
{\an5}DAVID:
I don't know
why you're so surprised.

22:28.472 --> 22:29.806
You're the one
who introduced them.

22:29.890 --> 22:31.600
{\an3}Well, I never expected
them to come here.

22:31.683 --> 22:33.226
{\an3}I mean, this is
a sorority sex-out party,

22:33.310 --> 22:34.352
for God's sake.

22:34.436 --> 22:37.606
{\an1}Well, maybe they're just here
for a little clean living.

22:37.689 --> 22:39.441
Somehow I doubt that.

22:39.524 --> 22:40.942
I'll be right back.

22:43.403 --> 22:45.113
Uh, excuse me.

22:45.197 --> 22:47.407
Come here.

22:52.245 --> 22:53.663
Everything working out?

22:53.747 --> 22:54.748
Mm-hmm, just like
you said it would.

22:54.831 --> 22:56.208
{\an3}What's your deal,
Ginger?

22:56.291 --> 22:57.751
What are you talking about?

22:57.834 --> 22:58.627
There is no way
you would come here,

22:58.710 --> 22:59.836
knowing how everybody feels
about you

22:59.920 --> 23:01.505
unless you were up to something.

23:01.588 --> 23:03.965
Don't worry so much, Val.

23:04.049 --> 23:07.594
{\an1}Everything's going to be
just fine.

23:11.598 --> 23:13.975
(man snorting)

23:14.059 --> 23:15.811
You having a good time?

23:15.894 --> 23:17.979
{\an1}Yeah. Yes, I'm having
a great time.

23:18.063 --> 23:19.314
There's plenty more.

23:19.397 --> 23:21.191
{\an3}We can have a great
time all night.

23:21.274 --> 23:22.818
Oh, yeah.

23:24.736 --> 23:26.488
{\an3}Hey, Danny.

23:26.571 --> 23:28.740
{\an3}Danny, I don't,
I don't feel so good.

23:28.824 --> 23:30.117
Can I have some more?

23:31.701 --> 23:32.994
Go ask Kirk.

23:33.078 --> 23:34.663
Get it from his stash.

23:34.746 --> 23:35.664
{\an3}Kirk's mad
at me.

23:35.747 --> 23:37.457
{\an3}Please?

23:37.541 --> 23:38.917
Sorry, honey.

23:40.252 --> 23:42.671
No free rides, Sherry.

23:42.754 --> 23:45.632
{\an3}I didn't say it
would be for free.

23:45.715 --> 23:48.135
{\an3}I know the way
you like it.

23:48.218 --> 23:49.344
I can make you
feel real good.

23:49.427 --> 23:50.679
Listen, if I give you
what you want,

23:50.762 --> 23:52.139
will you get out of my hair?

23:52.222 --> 23:55.475
{\an3}Yeah. Sure,
I will.

23:55.559 --> 23:56.852
All right, come on.

23:56.935 --> 23:58.687
I'll take care of you.

23:58.770 --> 24:00.522
{\an3}I'll just be a minute,
all right, Kelly?

24:00.605 --> 24:01.523
Yeah.

24:01.606 --> 24:03.316
AMm-hmm.t?

24:16.413 --> 24:18.206
{\an1}Hey, hey, hey!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

24:18.290 --> 24:19.708
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Where you going?

24:19.791 --> 24:21.001
What's your rush?

24:21.084 --> 24:22.878
Uh, I got to go.
I have someone I have to meet.

24:22.961 --> 24:23.670
{\an3}Aw, man.

24:23.753 --> 24:25.714
{\an3}We, uh, we barely
even met yet.

24:25.797 --> 24:27.215
{\an3}I thought we could, uh,
you know hang,

24:27.299 --> 24:29.050
I've really got to go.

24:29.134 --> 24:31.052
{\an3}Well, I don't think
you're going anywhere.

24:31.136 --> 24:32.387
See, you got a bill...

24:32.471 --> 24:34.014
the biggest bill.

24:34.097 --> 24:35.724
{\an3}I mean, do you have
any idea

24:35.807 --> 24:37.559
{\an3}how much
pharmaceuticals are?

24:37.642 --> 24:38.727
{\an3}Huh?

24:38.810 --> 24:39.728
Danny!

24:39.811 --> 24:40.854
Hey! Danny's busy!

24:40.937 --> 24:43.857
(muffled screaming):
No! No!

24:43.940 --> 24:45.525
Yeah... (mutters)

24:45.609 --> 24:47.068
Come over to the couch,

24:47.152 --> 24:49.237
{\an3}Strawberry, 'cause you've
got some work to do.

24:49.321 --> 24:50.363
So stop yelling.

24:50.447 --> 24:51.865
Stop it. Stop it.

24:51.948 --> 24:53.200
You gonna stop yelling?

24:53.283 --> 24:54.784
{\an3}You gonna
stop yelling?

24:54.868 --> 24:57.370
{\an3}Okay.
Stop yelling.

24:57.454 --> 24:58.830
I mean, come on.

24:58.914 --> 25:01.374
{\an3}I don't understand
why we can't get along.

25:01.458 --> 25:04.544
{\an3}I'm very...
I'm nice.

25:05.795 --> 25:07.756
Okay... just wait a second.

25:07.839 --> 25:10.759
Look, let's, um...

25:10.842 --> 25:11.885
have some more, um...

25:11.968 --> 25:13.261
wine, all right?

25:13.345 --> 25:14.763
Yeah.

25:14.846 --> 25:17.224
Well... that's good.

25:17.307 --> 25:18.892
We could do that.

25:18.975 --> 25:20.769
Here. Now you're talking.

25:20.852 --> 25:23.772
Here, you pour the wine,
and I'll chop the line.

25:23.855 --> 25:25.232
{\an1}(chuckles)

25:25.315 --> 25:26.816
That rhymes.

25:26.900 --> 25:28.944
(muttering)

25:33.365 --> 25:34.991
(bottle shatters)

25:35.075 --> 25:36.284
Oh!

25:36.368 --> 25:37.869
You bitch!

25:37.953 --> 25:38.954
(whimpering)

26:00.725 --> 26:03.478
{\an5}STEVE:
Well, there's a match
made in heaven, huh?

26:03.561 --> 26:04.980
{\an6}SUSAN:
Valerie said
she was nice.

26:05.063 --> 26:06.314
She's a human virus.

26:06.398 --> 26:07.941
{\an1}Oh, they're keeping you
in the dark, I guess.

26:08.024 --> 26:09.609
{\an4}DAVID:
Yeah, we should definitely
keep our distance.

26:09.693 --> 26:11.278
Look, I just thought,

26:11.361 --> 26:12.779
{\an1}if Jonathan and Ginger
hit it off,

26:12.862 --> 26:14.155
{\an1}it would keep him
out of Susan's hair.

26:14.239 --> 26:16.283
{\an3}Well, they certainly
do deserve each other.

26:16.366 --> 26:17.200
{\an4}CLARE:
He'll be lucky
if he still has

26:17.284 --> 26:19.828
{\an3}his gold fillings
at the end of the night.

26:19.911 --> 26:21.079
{\an3}(chuckling)

26:22.706 --> 26:26.501
{\an1}Ooh! Don't look now,
but we're being watched.

26:26.584 --> 26:28.878
Great.

26:34.759 --> 26:36.303
Oh... What was that for?

26:36.386 --> 26:37.679
I thought we had a deal?

26:37.762 --> 26:40.765
{\an3}Yeah, just giving them
something to think about.

26:42.684 --> 26:43.768
Ooh, a slow dance.

26:43.852 --> 26:45.520
Come on, take me.

26:45.603 --> 26:47.314
{\an1}I told you, Arnold,
I am impervious

26:47.397 --> 26:49.649
{\an1}to your feminine wiles
for at least another....

26:49.733 --> 26:51.985
{\an1}ten hours.

26:52.068 --> 26:55.363
{\an3}But that's like
600 minutes, Steve.

26:55.447 --> 26:56.489
Yep.

26:56.573 --> 27:02.162
{\an3}600 long, hard,
throbbing minutes.

27:04.581 --> 27:08.251
Okay, let's dance, slow.

27:13.506 --> 27:15.342
Want to do it?

27:15.425 --> 27:17.260
Yeah, lead on.

27:21.014 --> 27:22.849
Well, I'm just glad
Jonathan has found

27:22.932 --> 27:25.101
{\an1}someone else to occupy
his attention.

27:25.185 --> 27:27.020
Yeah, and, apparently,

27:27.103 --> 27:29.481
{\an3}he's trying to occupy
your attention.

27:29.564 --> 27:32.609
{\an1}If you think he's making me
jealous, he's not.

27:32.692 --> 27:34.277
{\an3}Then what are
you staring at?

27:34.361 --> 27:35.945
I'm not staring.

27:36.029 --> 27:37.447
Sure.

27:37.530 --> 27:39.282
{\an1}I'm not. Why do you let him
get to you so much?

27:39.366 --> 27:40.658
He's not getting to me.

27:40.742 --> 27:42.327
Yes, he is.

27:42.410 --> 27:44.412
{\an1}Besides, he didn't come here
to make <i> me</i> jealous.

27:44.496 --> 27:45.747
{\an1}He came here to get
under <i> your</i> skin,

27:45.830 --> 27:47.916
{\an1}and, obviously,
it's working.

27:47.999 --> 27:49.793
{\an3}Oh, see, that's
where you're wrong.

27:49.876 --> 27:51.378
He's irrelevant.

27:51.461 --> 27:54.422
{\an3}I'm having
a great time.

27:54.506 --> 27:56.257
{\an1}So am I.

27:56.341 --> 27:59.094
Hey, Donna,
great party.

27:59.177 --> 28:01.304
Oh, did you guys see
Joe come in?

28:01.388 --> 28:03.264
{\an3}No, I haven't
seen him.

28:03.348 --> 28:05.475
Great. I'd better go give him
a call.

with real relationship material,

30:46.719 --> 30:48.805
not some guy who's obsessed
with another woman.

30:48.888 --> 30:51.432
I'm sorry. I just thought
once Jonathan saw

30:51.516 --> 30:53.810
how charming you were,
he'd forget all about Susan.

30:53.893 --> 30:55.270
I guess you weren't
that charming.

30:55.353 --> 30:56.604
Really?

30:56.688 --> 30:59.232
Let's see how charming
David thinks I am.

31:05.363 --> 31:06.614
Hey, Nat.

31:06.698 --> 31:08.116
You missed all the fun.

31:08.199 --> 31:09.617
Susan clocked Casten.

31:09.701 --> 31:12.287
{\an3}Oh, cool.
Um, um...

31:12.370 --> 31:13.454
Excuse me, Susan.

31:13.538 --> 31:15.290
{\an3}Can I speak to Brandon
for a second?

31:15.373 --> 31:16.708
Excuse me.

31:20.211 --> 31:21.629
{\an3}Uh, Kelly's in big trouble.
I've got to go.

31:21.713 --> 31:24.132
Yeah, yeah, come on.

31:24.215 --> 31:25.967
(sighs)

31:26.050 --> 31:28.761
Um... David, I think
you should sit down.

31:31.556 --> 31:33.725
What are you being
so dramatic about?

31:35.393 --> 31:37.520
You know how hard it was

31:37.604 --> 31:39.147
{\an1}for me to get accepted
by everyone, right?

31:39.230 --> 31:41.149
Right.

31:41.232 --> 31:42.483
Remember how...

31:42.567 --> 31:45.278
Ray was accused
for stealing all that stuff

31:45.361 --> 31:46.779
back in September?

31:46.863 --> 31:47.780
Right.

31:47.864 --> 31:48.990
(sighs)

31:49.073 --> 31:50.325
It was a hoax.

31:50.408 --> 31:52.327
{\an1}Ginger and I took
all that stuff

31:52.410 --> 31:54.662
so I could bust her

31:54.746 --> 31:55.830
and look like a hero.

31:55.913 --> 31:57.498
There, I said it.

31:57.582 --> 31:59.667
You're kidding me, right?

31:59.751 --> 32:01.502
No.

32:01.586 --> 32:03.087
(sighs)

32:04.922 --> 32:07.342
So why are you telling me
this now?

32:07.425 --> 32:11.054
Because she's trying
to blackmail me, and...

32:11.137 --> 32:12.680
{\an1}you're the only one
who can get me out of it.

32:12.764 --> 32:14.349
Why me?

32:14.432 --> 32:16.351
She taped a... (sighs)

32:16.434 --> 32:20.605
very incriminating conversation
between us last fall...

32:23.775 --> 32:27.362
{\an3}and she said if I don't
give her $50,000...

32:27.445 --> 32:29.656
{\an3}she's going to play it
for everyone.

32:29.739 --> 32:31.532
(scoffs)

32:31.616 --> 32:34.327
50 Gs?

32:34.410 --> 32:36.162
Phew! Man...

32:36.245 --> 32:37.664
she's not playing around.

32:39.415 --> 32:41.751
You got that kind of money?

32:41.834 --> 32:44.921
Yeah... but it's all I got.

32:46.798 --> 32:48.841
David, there's no way anybody
is gonna forgive me for this.

32:48.925 --> 32:53.721
Well, if it means
that much to you, uh...

32:53.805 --> 32:55.431
pay her.

32:57.100 --> 32:59.352
Well, she did give
another option.

32:59.435 --> 33:00.770
She said that, uh,

33:00.853 --> 33:02.355
she would leave
town for good,

33:02.438 --> 33:04.065
{\an3}and give me
back the tape...

33:05.191 --> 33:08.444
if you would...
sleep with her.

33:11.197 --> 33:13.282
Wait a minute,
let me get this straight.

33:13.366 --> 33:15.118
Ginger's gonna
give up 50 Gs

33:15.201 --> 33:16.744
just to sleep with me?

33:16.828 --> 33:18.413
Yeah.

33:18.496 --> 33:19.956
Flattered?

33:20.039 --> 33:21.749
I'm... I'm amazed.

33:22.834 --> 33:24.836
David, you...

33:24.919 --> 33:26.754
{\an3}you know I love
you, right?

33:26.838 --> 33:27.964
{\an3}But...

33:28.047 --> 33:29.590
what else can I do?

33:31.342 --> 33:32.927
I could lose everything.

33:38.891 --> 33:41.102
I don't know.

33:41.185 --> 33:43.312
Just let me sleep on it.

33:43.396 --> 33:44.939
I can't.

33:45.022 --> 33:47.108
I have to let her
know by midnight,

33:47.191 --> 33:49.277
or she's gonna play
that tape for everyone.

33:49.360 --> 33:51.863
David, please.

33:52.864 --> 33:53.906
Please.

34:14.594 --> 34:15.928
I'll be right back.

34:16.012 --> 34:17.263
Okay.tay here.

34:22.310 --> 34:23.518
{\an3}Kelly?

34:27.065 --> 34:28.775
{\an3}Kelly?

34:30.067 --> 34:31.485
{\an3}Kelly?

34:31.569 --> 34:33.112
Kelly.

34:34.864 --> 34:35.782
{\an3}Kelly.

34:35.864 --> 34:37.449
(takes sharp, quick breath)

34:40.244 --> 34:41.329
(hyperventilating)

34:41.411 --> 34:44.373
Brandon, please help me.

34:44.456 --> 34:45.833
(crying)y, it's okay.

34:45.917 --> 34:47.335
{\an3}Hey, hey, hey,
it's okay.

34:47.418 --> 34:49.003
{\an3}It's okay, it's
all right.

34:49.085 --> 34:51.505
It's okay, it's okay.

34:58.763 --> 35:00.139
(knock at door)

35:05.228 --> 35:07.021
What's going on?

35:07.105 --> 35:08.898
I'm quitting school.

35:08.981 --> 35:10.399
{\an3}I'm getting the
hell out of here.

35:10.483 --> 35:12.193
{\an1}Joe, what are you
talking about?

35:12.276 --> 35:13.861
I'm off the team.

35:13.945 --> 35:16.489
{\an3}They're already recruiting
my replacement.

35:16.572 --> 35:18.074
{\an3}I guess nobody
wants a quarterback

35:18.157 --> 35:19.033
with a bad heart.

35:19.116 --> 35:21.369
{\an1}Wait, we don't
even know

35:21.452 --> 35:23.037
{\an1}how serious
your condition is yet.

35:23.120 --> 35:25.206
And what do you
know about it?

35:25.289 --> 35:27.667
{\an1}Oh, oh, that's great,
so what are you gonna do,

35:27.750 --> 35:29.168
{\an1}just slink off
in the middle of the night?

35:29.252 --> 35:30.586
Look, I don't want
to talk about it.

35:30.670 --> 35:32.046
Would you just go back
to your little party?

35:32.129 --> 35:34.507
{\an3}Hey, and what
about me?

35:34.590 --> 35:36.175
I don't know what else to do.

35:36.259 --> 35:37.760
Look, first of all,
the coach has to do

35:37.844 --> 35:39.387
what he has to do--
he has a job, too.

35:39.470 --> 35:41.722
Is that supposed
to cheer me up?

35:43.683 --> 35:45.518
No.

35:47.311 --> 35:50.398
{\an1}But you don't even know
what's wrong with you yet.

35:50.481 --> 35:52.942
{\an1}And neither
does that coach.

35:58.489 --> 36:00.575
(sighs)

36:00.658 --> 36:02.201
{\an3}Do you know
what it's like

36:02.285 --> 36:05.371
{\an3}to work for something
your entire life,

36:05.454 --> 36:10.001
and then... it's just
taken away from you?

36:12.336 --> 36:14.463
(sighs)

36:20.803 --> 36:22.221
(sighs)

36:24.140 --> 36:26.142
(crickets chirping)

36:50.708 --> 36:53.294
{\an5}DAVID:
<i>"The power of destiny</i>
<i>pulls like a rage.</i>

36:53.377 --> 36:56.881
<i>"The touch of your lips</i>

36:56.964 --> 37:01.177

{\an5}STEVE:

37:18.235 --> 37:20.488
{\an1}CLARE:
STEVE: Ten... it.

37:20.571 --> 37:22.657
nine, eight...

37:22.740 --> 37:24.659
{\an1}You had
seven...trol.

37:24.742 --> 37:25.826
{\an3}You did it.

37:25.910 --> 37:26.994
Come on.

37:27.078 --> 37:28.829
Come get your winnings.

37:28.913 --> 37:29.997
{\an3}Come on.

37:30.081 --> 37:32.124
Two, one.

37:33.209 --> 37:35.002
(screaming excitedly)

37:35.086 --> 37:37.171
{\an3}(giggling)

37:37.254 --> 37:39.006
What's so funny?

37:39.090 --> 37:41.175
{\an3}I set the clock
forward 30 seconds.

37:41.259 --> 37:43.010
It's not 8:00 yet.

37:43.094 --> 37:44.136
You lose, sucker.

37:44.220 --> 37:45.680
{\an1}Oh, yeah? Well,
the joke's on you.

37:45.763 --> 37:47.848
{\an1}I set it back--
it's 8:01.

37:47.932 --> 37:50.017
Now give me some loving, baby.

37:50.101 --> 37:51.352
{\an1}(laughing
and snorting)

37:51.435 --> 37:53.020
You're kidding.

37:53.104 --> 37:54.814
(kissing loudly)

38:04.573 --> 38:06.409
Hi.

38:10.955 --> 38:12.915
Here you go.

38:14.750 --> 38:16.127
Any copies?

38:16.210 --> 38:17.378
(laughs)

38:17.461 --> 38:18.754
Please, Val.

38:18.838 --> 38:20.923
Honor among thieves, you know?

38:21.966 --> 38:23.050
{\an1}Besides,

38:23.134 --> 38:25.177
I got what I wanted.

38:25.261 --> 38:27.722
Well, I hope you're happy.

38:27.805 --> 38:29.056
Mmm.

38:29.140 --> 38:31.308
More than you can imagine.

38:35.229 --> 38:38.274
I gotta go
if I'm gonna catch my plane.

38:39.775 --> 38:40.901
Bye, Val.

38:40.985 --> 38:42.028
Bye, Ginger.

38:42.111 --> 38:43.988
Don't hurry back.

38:44.071 --> 38:45.031
I won't.

38:45.114 --> 38:47.241
We have a deal, remember?

38:54.665 --> 38:56.375
Hi.

38:58.878 --> 39:00.796
Listen, David, I'm...

39:00.880 --> 39:03.257
I'm really sorry.

39:03.340 --> 39:05.301
{\an3}I know you're totally
disgusted with me,

39:05.384 --> 39:07.303
{\an3}and... and I
don't blame you.

39:08.220 --> 39:11.223
{\an3}Last night was the
worst night of my life.

39:11.307 --> 39:13.309
{\an3}I mean, the thought
of you touching her just...

39:13.392 --> 39:15.436
just drove me crazy.

39:17.813 --> 39:19.440
I never laid a finger on her.

39:20.524 --> 39:21.609
What?

39:21.692 --> 39:23.611
I told her I was in love
with you

39:23.694 --> 39:24.904
and I wouldn't do it.

39:26.572 --> 39:27.990
But I don't understand.

39:28.074 --> 39:29.950
{\an3}I mean, she...
she gave me the tape back.

39:31.869 --> 39:33.996
Ginger didn't want
to sleep with me, Val.

39:34.080 --> 39:36.248
She wanted to hurt you.

39:41.879 --> 39:44.173
I'm really sorry I had
to drag you into this.

39:44.256 --> 39:46.342
Me, too.

39:46.425 --> 39:48.427
(sighs)

39:48.511 --> 39:50.221
At least nothing happened.

39:52.098 --> 39:53.432
That's where you're wrong.

39:54.433 --> 39:55.810
A lot happened.

39:57.394 --> 40:00.439
And as far as I'm concerned...

40:02.691 --> 40:04.819
it's over between you and me.

40:04.902 --> 40:05.986
What?

40:06.070 --> 40:06.946
{\an1}It's over.

40:07.029 --> 40:11.325
And you know what the irony
of this is?

40:11.408 --> 40:12.827
I want to be with you more

40:12.910 --> 40:14.829
than anyone else in the world,
and I can't.

40:14.912 --> 40:16.497
{\an1}Not after what you
asked me to do.

40:16.580 --> 40:17.998
But, David, I had no choice.

40:18.082 --> 40:20.417
There's always a choice, Val.

40:22.753 --> 40:25.506
So, you're probably
gonna tell everybody, right?

40:27.466 --> 40:29.426
No.

40:31.762 --> 40:33.931
I wouldn't do that to you.

41:00.583 --> 41:03.252
{\an5}WOMAN (over intercom):
Dr. James Friedman,
to patient services.

41:03.335 --> 41:04.503
Dr. James Friedman...

41:04.587 --> 41:06.589
{\an3}Here, honey,
have some water.

41:06.672 --> 41:08.716
They want you to drink
lots of fluids.

41:08.799 --> 41:11.135
You're very dehydrated.

41:14.138 --> 41:16.223
I'm sorry, Mom.

41:17.183 --> 41:19.059
Everything's gonna be okay.

41:19.143 --> 41:20.853
{\an3}BRANDON:
You're in good hands.

41:20.936 --> 41:22.229
They'll take real
good care of you.

41:22.313 --> 41:25.566
{\an3}And, uh, we'll
all be here.

41:27.109 --> 41:28.694
{\an3}JACKIE:
Come on, Brandon.

41:28.777 --> 41:30.821
{\an1}Let's let her
get some sleep.

41:30.905 --> 41:32.198
{\an3}Yeah.

41:32.281 --> 41:34.200
{\an1}KELLY:
Brandon?

41:34.283 --> 41:36.076
Will you stay?

41:36.160 --> 41:38.287
MAN (over intercom):
Dr. Kirk, neonatal.

41:38.370 --> 41:41.123
Dr. Kirk, neonatal.

41:43.626 --> 41:45.294
I'm here for you.

41:47.379 --> 41:49.381
I wish you were.

41:49.465 --> 41:51.133
I am.

41:51.217 --> 41:53.552
I always have been.

41:53.636 --> 41:55.638
What did I do?

41:57.223 --> 41:58.974
You're gonna be all right.

41:59.975 --> 42:01.644
I feel like such a loser.

42:02.686 --> 42:03.938
You're not a loser.

42:04.021 --> 42:04.980
Don't say that.

42:05.064 --> 42:07.608
I am.

42:07.691 --> 42:10.486
Look what I've done to myself.

42:12.071 --> 42:14.490
You're just human, Kel.

42:14.573 --> 42:16.200
That's all.

42:20.371 --> 42:22.414
(sighs)

42:22.498 --> 42:25.417
I had everything.

42:27.419 --> 42:29.797
And I lost it all.

42:35.094 --> 42:38.138
All that matters now is that
you take care of yourself.

42:39.223 --> 42:41.725
I still love you, Brandon.

42:48.232 --> 42:50.484
Yeah, look, um...

42:52.403 --> 42:54.113
You'd better get some sleep.

42:55.197 --> 42:56.198
I'm so scared.
