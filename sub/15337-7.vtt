- This is our daughter, Betsy.
- Hi.

00:04.738 --> 00:07.007
I have withdrawn
from college.
You made us a deal.

00:07.075 --> 00:09.377
- I made my choice, Mom.
- She's enlisted.

00:09.443 --> 00:12.080
- She's not ready.
- She isn't or you aren't?

00:12.146 --> 00:14.582
There's a big disconnection
between military wife...

00:14.648 --> 00:18.219
and mother of a kid
who just signed up.

00:20.854 --> 00:25.159
[ Bob ] Did you find
what you were looking for?
Where do you think you're going?

00:25.226 --> 00:27.361
- To a trial and execution.
- You take this to the team.

00:27.428 --> 00:32.166
An officer sleeps with
a shooter's wife and he's
executed. That's the Unit code.

00:32.233 --> 00:35.903
- And if he is found guilty,
we will honor that code.
- There will be a trial.

00:35.969 --> 00:38.072
- I did cheat.
- I know.

Yes.

Tom Ryan?
Never in this life.

been found guilty.
It's our problem.

01:09.337 --> 01:12.606
Well, the question
still stands.
What's the punishment?

01:12.673 --> 01:16.777
He knew the punishment
the moment he chose
to sleep with my wife.

01:16.844 --> 01:19.213
How does that differ
from vigilante justice?

01:19.280 --> 01:21.949
We're not the first to stand
in judgment of an officer
who's betrayed his men.

01:22.015 --> 01:27.355
- It's the code.
- A warrior joins the Unit,
he swears to live by the code.

01:27.421 --> 01:31.159
It holds true
for an operator or an officer.

01:31.225 --> 01:33.894
- We could turn him in.
- And?

01:33.961 --> 01:37.398
The army will strip him
of his rank and he'll
lose his command.

01:37.465 --> 01:39.533
Would that be sufficient?

01:42.002 --> 01:47.575
This was an ongoing,
planned, premeditated
violation.

he was sleeping with?

01:55.916 --> 01:58.286
He'd be dead already.

or who took her.

It's none of your concern.

05:19.820 --> 05:22.423
You're gonna frag him,
aren't you?

05:22.490 --> 05:26.527
- Is that what I'm gonna do?
- We've got a chance here, Mack,
to be a family again.

we're giving up

So the convoy had
to take Route Seattle,

It funneled them

That's right.

09:52.225 --> 09:54.828
Why were they there

Probably working with

He LoJacked himself.

Thallium?

35:07.273 --> 35:09.508
It's a radioactive isotope.

35:09.575 --> 35:11.710
How strong
a gamma reading could
the thallium produce?

35:11.777 --> 35:15.113
Could a Predator
track him from the sky?

I don't know.
Let's find out.

38:00.479 --> 38:03.582
Outbound, to Syria.
Seventy yards.

38:03.649 --> 38:07.819
We're only tasked to stop
vehicles coming into Iraq with
W.M.D., not the ones leaving.

38:07.886 --> 38:11.690
- Do we stop?
- W.M.D.'s won't register
above a five.

38:11.757 --> 38:15.694

It's a gamma hit.

Fifty yards.
Do you want me to stop it?

If that's Colonel Ryan,
we should pull
the truck over now.

this is his plan.

Why didn't he tell anybody
that he was doing this?
He would've been stopped.

He's trying to get to Betsy
before they kill her.
That's his plan.

39:14.019 --> 39:18.123

that's not a plan.
That's suicide.

39:47.118 --> 39:50.055
The country of Syria
