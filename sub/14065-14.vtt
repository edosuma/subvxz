NARRATOR:<i> Previously on </i>Boston Legal...

00:02.502 --> 00:04.379
Are you and Denise
having intimate relations?

00:04.462 --> 00:05.422
Why would you ask me that?

00:05.505 --> 00:06.631
-Are you?
-Are you?

00:06.715 --> 00:08.633
You and I have an arrangement.
No exclusivity.

00:08.717 --> 00:09.759
Are you sleeping
with somebody else in this office?

00:09.843 --> 00:11.803
-I'm not having this conversation.
-Denise, I will not be made a fool of.

00:11.886 --> 00:13.304
Are you sleeping with somebody else
in this office?

00:13.388 --> 00:14.472
I'm not answering these questions.

00:14.556 --> 00:17.976
"Professor Clifford Cabot's cabinet
of sexual curiosities."

00:18.059 --> 00:20.854
This is my vision.
It's not just some collection of smut.

00:20.937 --> 00:22.897
Ever appear before a raving loon
named Clark Brown?

00:22.981 --> 00:24.315
Shocking. Outrageous.

00:24.399 --> 00:26.401
These are serious criminal charges.

00:26.484 --> 00:28.278
Seventy years old,
still lives with his mother.

00:28.361 --> 00:30.989
Do you know what my mother would call you?
A namby-pamby.

00:38.038 --> 00:39.205
(elevator bell dings)

00:39.497 --> 00:40.915
(horn honks)

00:47.464 --> 00:48.548
What are you looking at?

00:51.760 --> 00:53.595
Bethany, you got taller.

00:53.678 --> 00:55.472
I'm just trying it out, snidey-doo.

00:55.805 --> 00:57.390
Well, it looks smashing on you.

00:58.141 --> 01:00.977
-Is there a reason you're here?
-I'm meeting Denny for breakfast.

01:01.061 --> 01:02.937
I'd say "join us," but that might ruin it.

01:03.021 --> 01:05.482
-(horn honks)
-Oh, dear.

01:05.815 --> 01:06.775
Judge Brown.

01:07.692 --> 01:09.736
I need to see Denny Crane, please.

01:09.819 --> 01:10.653
Why?

01:11.321 --> 01:14.699
It is a matter of great urgency
for which I need a powerful firm.

01:17.702 --> 01:20.121
What's the urgency?
Your shorts riding up on you?

01:20.622 --> 01:21.956
This is a grave matter.

01:22.040 --> 01:23.875
I'd appreciate your sensitivity.

01:23.958 --> 01:25.502
I am nothing if not sensitive.

01:28.088 --> 01:31.466
Eighteen months ago,
I was diagnosed with SSAD.

01:31.549 --> 01:34.135
-Oh.
-I was directed to a rehab facility

01:34.219 --> 01:36.221
where I was told I'd be cured.

01:36.763 --> 01:39.516
$40,000 later, I am not cured.

01:40.350 --> 01:42.310
Oh, I'm so sorry, Judge.

01:42.936 --> 01:45.855
-What's SSAD?
-Same-Sex Attraction Disorder.

01:47.398 --> 01:48.233
What do you mean?

01:48.775 --> 01:53.154
I-- it's a disorder where a person thinks
he's attracted to the same sex.

01:53.863 --> 01:54.697
What do you mean?

01:55.240 --> 01:59.077
What I mean is the person
becomes erroneously convinced

01:59.160 --> 02:02.622
that he's sexually attracted
to a person of the same sex.

02:02.705 --> 02:04.791
-This affects you?
-Yes.

02:06.501 --> 02:07.418
But you're a man.

02:08.169 --> 02:09.212
That would mean you're attracted...

02:10.296 --> 02:12.006
-to men.
-Yes.

02:13.091 --> 02:17.178
Oh, I'm not, of course.
It's just that I think I am.

02:17.762 --> 02:19.180
You mean like homosexual gay?

02:19.264 --> 02:21.141
Well, which is why I want to sue.

02:21.724 --> 02:24.936
I will not take this lying down.

02:27.355 --> 02:30.817

02:57.552 --> 03:00.305
Shirley, this is my sister Carol,
my niece Michelle.

03:00.388 --> 03:03.141
Michelle regrettably was a victim
of a rather

03:03.224 --> 03:05.727
-traumatic assault last night.
-What happened?

03:06.978 --> 03:08.479
I was molested by a rabbi.

03:08.730 --> 03:10.315
She's not even really Jewish.

03:10.523 --> 03:12.984
-We could make this out a hate crime.
-I'm<i> half </i>Jewish.

03:13.067 --> 03:14.485
(scoffs) Her father's side.

03:14.569 --> 03:16.571
You were-- This was last night?

03:17.739 --> 03:19.741
I've been getting counseling
from my father's rabbi

03:19.824 --> 03:22.785
over my so-called disability
with intimacy,

03:22.869 --> 03:25.330
which is the new term for prudes, I guess.

03:26.706 --> 03:30.043
And he sucked me down
this path-of-trust thingy,

03:30.126 --> 03:33.254
and last night he somehow got me
to lie naked with him,

03:33.338 --> 03:37.050
and he pressed his fat, naked body
against mine

03:37.133 --> 03:40.386
and groped me like an ape.
I was practically enveloped by flab.

03:40.887 --> 03:42.305
Did you ask him to stop?

03:42.388 --> 03:45.808
-She's only 16. It wouldn't matter.
-I understand, but--

03:45.892 --> 03:49.687
I asked him to stop,
and he made some stupid comment, like,

03:49.938 --> 03:51.272
"Why should priests have all the fun?"

03:51.356 --> 03:53.816
Which I did not find funny.
He should get letters.

03:54.901 --> 03:56.277
Have you been to the police?

03:56.361 --> 03:58.321
We've been to the police.
This isn't about that.

03:58.613 --> 04:00.990
-What is it about then?
-There's a new pill.

04:01.074 --> 04:03.326
It's still in the trial stage.
Perhaps you've heard of it.

04:03.409 --> 04:05.536
-It's called "the forgetting pill."
-"The forgetting pill"?

04:05.620 --> 04:09.123
Basically, if you take it in the immediate
aftermath of a traumatic event,

04:09.374 --> 04:11.084
it can make you forget that event,

04:11.167 --> 04:14.003
the goal being to circumvent
the emotional scarring.

04:14.587 --> 04:16.172
Michelle's father wants her to take it.

04:16.256 --> 04:18.007
He's going for a court order. (chuckles)

04:18.091 --> 04:21.511
We think the idea is perverse.
A pill that makes you forget?

04:21.594 --> 04:23.972
Aldous Huxley didn't even dream of that.

04:24.597 --> 04:28.518
Well, actually he did, but still,
to experiment with a person's memory,

04:28.768 --> 04:30.937
-the idea is grotesque.
-Whoa, uh, hold on a second.

04:31.020 --> 04:33.314
-You and the father are--
-We're divorced.

04:33.398 --> 04:35.149
He wants her to take the medication.

04:35.566 --> 04:37.777
-I'm opposed.
-Well, you can't force medication

04:37.860 --> 04:40.071
on a 16-year-old,
even if you're the father.

04:40.154 --> 04:42.615
-She wants to take it.
-Of course I do.

04:42.949 --> 04:44.909
How would you like
to spend the rest of your life

04:44.993 --> 04:47.370
remembering a fat, naked rabbi?

04:47.453 --> 04:49.831
-You have to trust us, sweetheart.
-Trust you?

04:50.415 --> 04:52.500
You're a bigger perv than the rabbi.

04:52.959 --> 04:55.962
Um, Michelle, something tells me

04:56.045 --> 04:57.463
that if you really wanted
to take this pill,

04:57.547 --> 04:59.048
you would've done so by now.

04:59.132 --> 05:02.969
No, because these two
freaked the doctors out

05:03.052 --> 05:04.137
with all their threats of lawsuits,

05:04.220 --> 05:06.139
and they won't give it to me
without her consent.

05:08.141 --> 05:09.559
It just seems morally wrong.

05:09.934 --> 05:13.396
Her father's going to court.
Shirley, we need your help.

05:28.244 --> 05:30.580
I do not want her here.

05:31.414 --> 05:34.500
-Medical malpractice is my niche.
-Your Honor, she can help.

05:34.584 --> 05:36.294
I've seen her in action.
She's a little dynamo.

05:37.879 --> 05:42.008
How exactly does this same-sex
attraction disorder play out?

05:42.258 --> 05:46.054
Well, I find men,
and I have relations with them.

05:47.263 --> 05:49.432
I've been struggling with this
most of my life.

05:49.515 --> 05:51.809
About a year and a half ago,
I had a talk with my minister.

05:51.893 --> 05:54.520
He gave me the diagnosis of SSAD,

05:55.021 --> 05:58.107
told me he knew of a faith-based facility
that could help me.

05:58.191 --> 06:00.276
It's called "Better Tomorrows."

06:00.568 --> 06:01.986
They're a sham.

06:02.236 --> 06:06.407
$40,000 later, I still have urges.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.619
I've seen this exact same thing before,

06:09.702 --> 06:11.996
-and I think I can explain it.
-You can?

06:12.080 --> 06:14.248
Yes. You're totally gay.

06:14.499 --> 06:16.709
I am not! How dare you?

06:16.793 --> 06:19.504
Your Honor,
going to court's a very public forum.

06:19.921 --> 06:20.880
Are you sure you want to do this?

06:21.464 --> 06:25.802
At some point,
a man has to stand up for principle.

06:26.594 --> 06:29.013
This Better Tomorrows...

06:29.931 --> 06:31.099
It's outrageous!

06:36.604 --> 06:37.647
(toilet flushing)

06:40.066 --> 06:41.067
Congratulations.

06:42.068 --> 06:43.403
What? Oh.

06:43.486 --> 06:46.280
Uh, no, it's negative. No blue line.

06:46.364 --> 06:48.616
Yeah, I could tell from your reaction.

06:49.784 --> 06:50.785
Who's the father?

06:51.411 --> 06:52.245
Nobody.

06:54.205 --> 06:55.415
Nobody is the father.

06:56.124 --> 06:59.669
You really shouldn't claim that, Denise.
They'll throw rocks at your kid.

07:00.545 --> 07:02.213
You have a smart little wisecrack
for everything,

07:02.296 --> 07:03.589
-don't you?
-Most things.

07:09.053 --> 07:10.012
You okay?

07:10.972 --> 07:11.806
No.

07:14.684 --> 07:15.560
What am I gonna do?

07:18.187 --> 07:20.690
Well, you can have it...

07:21.816 --> 07:22.650
or not.

07:27.530 --> 07:28.364
Can you help?

07:29.031 --> 07:32.118
It's just the subject matter
makes me a little uncomfortable.

07:32.785 --> 07:34.287
I'm afraid I won't do my best work.

07:34.745 --> 07:36.330
-What about Bethany?
-DENNY: She'll be around.

07:37.206 --> 07:40.334
But I want one of those really,
really long closings.

07:40.418 --> 07:42.336
-Oh.
-We've all come to expect them.

07:44.130 --> 07:47.133
Your Honor, do you really want
this problem aired out?

07:49.469 --> 07:52.889
Companies like this,
they threaten our national security.

07:53.473 --> 07:54.849
Of course they do.

07:54.932 --> 07:58.227
Well, if people get the idea that--
that businesses like this are shams,

07:58.311 --> 08:01.689
they may stop trying to cure themselves
of homosexuality.

08:01.772 --> 08:02.857
(chuckling) But, Your Honor,

08:02.940 --> 08:06.110
you can't really cure homosexuality
with therapy.

08:07.320 --> 08:08.321
You need to take a pill.

08:08.613 --> 08:11.449
How dare you make light of this situation!

08:11.908 --> 08:13.701
I think I'm gay, for God's sake.

08:13.951 --> 08:15.328
-It's--
-Hard on the hips.

08:16.204 --> 08:17.455
Shocking!

08:18.581 --> 08:19.415
All rise.

08:19.874 --> 08:21.834
Case number 32666,

08:22.293 --> 08:24.629
<i>Judge Clark Brown vs. Better Tomorrows.</i>

08:26.047 --> 08:28.966
(erotic music playing)

08:34.639 --> 08:35.723
Oh, my.

08:39.435 --> 08:40.978
Alan Shore for the plaintiff.

08:41.062 --> 08:43.773
Could I perhaps get
an ex parte sidebar, Judge?

08:44.649 --> 08:45.483
Approach.

08:49.820 --> 08:50.696
Good morning, Your Honor.

08:51.447 --> 08:54.534
I cannot be 100 percent sure,

08:54.742 --> 08:56.452
but I believe years ago,

08:56.536 --> 08:59.789
long before you were a judge,
there was a party.

09:00.581 --> 09:02.208
I believe I was at it,

09:02.291 --> 09:03.793
and I believe Your Honor was.

09:03.876 --> 09:07.964
And it turned out we only had
one motor vehicle between us,

09:08.256 --> 09:10.258
so I offered to give you a lift.

09:10.341 --> 09:14.512
And even though between us,
we had two places of residence,

09:14.595 --> 09:15.972
we only went to one of them,

09:16.806 --> 09:20.726
and between you and me,
we had a very rewarding time.

09:21.102 --> 09:23.145
And I would hope that experience

09:23.604 --> 09:27.483
wouldn't come between us now
in a court of law.

09:29.735 --> 09:34.323
I'm glad you remember it, counsel,
because I don't.

09:35.366 --> 09:39.370
I guess between us,
one of us wasn't that memorable.

09:39.704 --> 09:43.666
Ah, well, I'm sure
it all pales in comparison

09:43.749 --> 09:45.543
to a subsequent party
I'm told you attended,

09:45.626 --> 09:47.837
one where the governor was there, as well.

09:47.920 --> 09:51.090
Do governors still appoint judges
in the Commonwealth?

09:52.300 --> 09:53.843
Between us, I believe they do.

09:54.343 --> 09:55.928
I'll hold you in contempt right now.

09:56.554 --> 09:57.972
My handcuffs or yours?

09:58.889 --> 10:00.558
You'd better respect this robe, Alan.

10:00.891 --> 10:04.729
Oh, I've already put it
and all of its contents

10:04.812 --> 10:06.814
on the highest of pedestals.

10:22.371 --> 10:23.331
Time is against us.

10:23.706 --> 10:25.750
If we don't give Michelle
the propranolol now,

10:25.833 --> 10:27.877
before this horrific memory
has a chance to set in--

10:27.960 --> 10:30.004
We're talking about a child's brain here.

10:30.296 --> 10:32.006
Why the rush to pump her with drugs?

10:32.089 --> 10:33.591
Because they can help my daughter!

10:33.674 --> 10:37.136
What is this drug you speak of?
It sounds like poopycock.

10:37.219 --> 10:39.263
It's called propranolol.
It's a beta-blocker.

10:39.347 --> 10:40.640
And it makes you forget?

10:40.723 --> 10:43.100
-You obviously wouldn't need it.
-Who said that?

10:43.684 --> 10:46.020
-He forgot.
-The drug essentially blocks adrenaline

10:46.103 --> 10:47.063
from entering the nerve cell,

10:47.146 --> 10:49.106
and adrenaline attaches emotion
to memories.

10:49.190 --> 10:50.858
If you take the drug quickly enough,

10:50.941 --> 10:53.444
it can prevent you from remembering
and being scarred by the trauma.

10:53.527 --> 10:54.904
Which in this case would be?

10:54.987 --> 10:57.657
-A naked rabbi.
-It's brainwashing, Your Honor.

10:57.740 --> 11:00.368
They use it with soldiers with P.T.S.D.
with good results.

11:00.451 --> 11:02.662
Even so, we're talking about a teenager.

11:02.745 --> 11:05.039
Who suffered a horrendous sexual assault.

11:05.122 --> 11:06.624
Now hold on just a second.

11:06.707 --> 11:08.376
Where is the naked rabbi?

11:08.751 --> 11:11.504
Your Honor, the issue before you
simply concerns Michelle's right

11:11.587 --> 11:12.713
to take this medication.

11:12.797 --> 11:14.507
And the father is for it,

11:14.590 --> 11:16.342
-and her mother is against it?
-SHIRLEY: Yes.

11:16.425 --> 11:19.345
-Who the hell are you?
-I'm the funny uncle.

11:20.513 --> 11:21.430
Every family has one.

11:21.514 --> 11:24.433
And you say the girl wishes
to take the medication?

11:24.850 --> 11:26.352
Why is it so difficult to understand?

11:26.435 --> 11:29.980
I do not want to spend the rest of my life
as a sexual assault victim.

11:30.064 --> 11:32.108
But, Michelle, that's what you are.

11:32.191 --> 11:34.902
But I don't have to be,
not psychologically.

11:35.486 --> 11:38.030
This isn't anybody's business but my own!

11:38.114 --> 11:40.282
Your Honor, my client, in addition
to being Michelle's father,

11:40.366 --> 11:41.575
is a psychiatrist.

11:41.659 --> 11:44.203
He can give medical testimony
as to the efficacy of this drug.

11:44.745 --> 11:47.039
-I would like you to hear from him.
-Get him up here!

11:54.422 --> 11:55.256
(knock on door)

11:55.673 --> 11:58.008
-You wanted to see me, sport?
-Why would I want to do that?

11:59.343 --> 12:02.471
Actually, um,
I called this little meeting.

12:06.100 --> 12:07.143
Could you sit, both of you?

12:07.560 --> 12:09.603
-Couch.
-Why?

12:09.687 --> 12:10.813
Brad, sit, please.

12:20.656 --> 12:21.949
There is no delicate way to say this,

12:22.032 --> 12:24.535
so... I'm pregnant.

12:25.327 --> 12:26.620
One of you is the father,

12:26.704 --> 12:29.832
and while I'm not asking either of you
to bear any responsibility,

12:30.916 --> 12:35.045
I would like to know
who the paternal parent is.

12:36.130 --> 12:37.047
What's this?

12:37.423 --> 12:39.633
-Brad, swab, please.
-Hold on a second. I have rights.

12:39.717 --> 12:40.926
You can't just drop a bomb.

12:41.010 --> 12:42.261
You have no rights
unless you're the father,

12:42.344 --> 12:43.888
which we won't know until we do the test,

12:43.971 --> 12:46.098
so, Brad, swab, please.

13:05.493 --> 13:06.327
Thanks.

13:07.912 --> 13:08.871
I'll get back to you.

13:14.251 --> 13:16.003
-What am I gonna do?
-Brad.

13:17.922 --> 13:18.964
One of us is a father.

13:26.388 --> 13:28.432
Well, there are many, many people
in this country

13:28.516 --> 13:31.393
who have fallen victim to this confusion

13:31.477 --> 13:33.604
over sexual orientation. It's shocking.

13:33.813 --> 13:36.690
-And these victims suffer from?
<i>-SSAD.</i>

13:37.566 --> 13:39.109
Same-sex attraction disorder.

13:39.777 --> 13:41.028
My minister diagnosed me,

13:41.111 --> 13:44.990
and he-- he recommended Better Tomorrows
for reparative therapy.

13:45.407 --> 13:47.952
And what does this treatment entail,
doctor?

13:48.494 --> 13:50.287
-I'm not a doctor.
-Whatever.

13:50.371 --> 13:53.249
Well, basically, it entails bible study,

13:54.208 --> 13:55.501
gender-appropriate activities,

13:55.584 --> 13:59.213
like, uh, sports activities for men,
sewing for women.

13:59.839 --> 14:03.217
We were to report all sexual fantasies
to the staff.

14:04.468 --> 14:09.223
Every day, they searched our belongings
for secular media, movies, CDs.

14:09.306 --> 14:11.058
Certain deviant behaviors were prohibited.

14:11.267 --> 14:14.186
-It was all very entailed.
-GLORIA: Come on.

14:14.478 --> 14:17.481
Did you actually believe
in all this nonsense?

14:17.565 --> 14:19.567
What you call "nonsense," I call values.

14:20.526 --> 14:22.486
So you went to the defendant...

14:22.570 --> 14:26.240
To be cured of these evil
and impure predilections.

14:26.323 --> 14:28.450
We're talking about homosexuality,
Your Honor.

14:28.534 --> 14:31.203
It's life-threatening.
If God doesn't get you for it,

14:31.287 --> 14:32.162
the skinheads will,

14:32.246 --> 14:34.123
and if the skinheads don't,
the Republicans will.

14:34.206 --> 14:36.917
And if the Republicans don't,
the southern Democrats will.

14:37.001 --> 14:39.420
And if they don't, by God,
it will be left up to Florida.

14:40.504 --> 14:43.841
I'm ready to be disciplined now. Chambers?

14:45.759 --> 14:47.011
I expressly directed you

14:47.094 --> 14:49.763
to refrain from your antics
in my courtroom.

14:50.639 --> 14:53.392
Yes, well, once I get started,
I just go on and on.

14:53.809 --> 14:55.102
Surely you remember.

14:55.853 --> 14:56.937
Shall we get started, Judge?

15:01.275 --> 15:05.195
You're suggesting an ex parte encounter
that would get us both disbarred.

15:05.279 --> 15:08.616
Yes, but on the upside,
I could tell you how bad you're being.

15:08.699 --> 15:11.160
And as I recall,
you like being a bad girl.

15:16.081 --> 15:17.708
Keep it about the case, counsel.

15:18.918 --> 15:19.835
That's all.

15:20.669 --> 15:21.503
You sure?

15:25.090 --> 15:26.508
That's all.

15:51.575 --> 15:52.910
Hey, Clarence. How's it going?

15:53.994 --> 15:55.537
-Good. You?
-Great.

15:57.915 --> 15:59.875
Well, it's been good catching up.

16:01.710 --> 16:03.003
How come you're looking at yourself?

16:05.297 --> 16:06.298
What was that?

16:06.924 --> 16:08.801
You were looking at yourself
when I came in.

16:08.884 --> 16:11.637
-How come?
-Well, Clarence, this is a conversation

16:11.720 --> 16:14.264
typically reserved for friends,
but what the hell?

16:14.515 --> 16:18.394
The reason they put these mirrors up
is so that people can look at themselves.

16:18.477 --> 16:20.938
Well, that felt good to get off my chest.

16:21.146 --> 16:23.941
-Thanks.
-You thinking about the baby?

16:26.610 --> 16:27.444
Claire told me.

16:28.946 --> 16:29.905
You worried it's yours?

16:32.658 --> 16:33.492
(sighs)

16:36.578 --> 16:39.373
Actually, I'm a little worried
that it might not be.

16:41.333 --> 16:43.961
You want it to be yours?

16:45.421 --> 16:46.672
I guess I do, actually.

16:47.464 --> 16:50.217
-Why I'm telling you this, I--
-You should tell Denise.

16:50.926 --> 16:54.346
I'll bet she's feeling real alone
right now and scared.

16:56.056 --> 16:58.350
You're getting kind of bold
in your old age, Clarence.

17:01.270 --> 17:02.104
Thanks.

17:07.401 --> 17:08.360
(door opens)

17:10.654 --> 17:11.488
-(sighs)
-(door closes)

17:17.619 --> 17:19.163
Denise, do you have a sec?

17:19.246 --> 17:21.707
Uh, actually, I don't. Can it wait?

17:23.208 --> 17:24.251
Apparently it can.

17:28.464 --> 17:31.133
Memories require time
to congeal in our brains.

17:31.550 --> 17:34.178
And while they're forming,
they can become stronger or weaker

17:34.261 --> 17:36.472
depending on how much adrenaline
is involved.

17:36.555 --> 17:39.433
-So if we wait too long...
-Then the memory will set,

17:39.516 --> 17:42.936
and Michelle will be haunted by this
for the rest of her life.

17:43.645 --> 17:46.440
Have you ever prescribed propranolol
as a licensed psychiatrist?

17:46.523 --> 17:49.443
Yes, many times with great success.

17:50.027 --> 17:52.613
I once gave propranolol
to a woman who had been raped.

17:52.821 --> 17:56.158
She couldn't even face her husband,
let alone undress in front of him,

17:56.241 --> 17:58.243
she was so ashamed and traumatized.

17:58.660 --> 17:59.870
After taking the medication,

17:59.953 --> 18:04.083
she reported feeling as though
the cord linking the memory to the emotion

18:04.166 --> 18:06.752
-had been cut.
-Is time of the essence?

18:06.835 --> 18:07.920
Absolutely.

18:08.253 --> 18:10.631
It has a much higher success rate
when given immediately,

18:11.006 --> 18:14.384
which is why I would like to prescribe it
for Michelle now.

18:15.344 --> 18:17.846
So let's just delete the memory
she'd like to forget?

18:18.138 --> 18:20.682
I'd like to erase my first husband.
That would be lovely.

18:20.974 --> 18:24.019
Ms. Schmidt, I work with
post-traumatic stress disorder.

18:24.103 --> 18:26.730
There's nothing funny about it.
I've seen what it does.

18:26.814 --> 18:29.024
People who have it, it ruins their lives.

18:29.108 --> 18:30.150
They can't hold down a job.

18:30.234 --> 18:32.694
They suffer from nightmares
and flashbacks.

18:32.778 --> 18:35.280
Ever have a patient
suffer those exact things

18:35.364 --> 18:37.783
because he or she suppressed the memories?

18:37.866 --> 18:39.326
I tend to know my patients.

18:39.409 --> 18:40.410
-This one's your daughter.
-Yeah.

18:40.494 --> 18:44.081
And because she is my daughter,
I know her better.

18:44.164 --> 18:46.208
Assuming you're thinking like a doctor,
not a father.

18:46.416 --> 18:51.088
I have the power to prevent an enormous,
potentially lifelong disability

18:51.171 --> 18:55.467
with virtually no side effects,
and how dare you try and stop me!

18:55.717 --> 18:57.594
-How dare you!
-What have I done?

18:57.678 --> 19:00.055
-This is her life!
-You speak as if it were yours.

19:00.139 --> 19:04.351
No, it's mine.
So how about letting me decide?

19:11.817 --> 19:13.527
(clears throat) Clarence.

19:13.944 --> 19:15.195
My office, please.

19:21.785 --> 19:22.619
(door closes)

19:23.245 --> 19:26.248
You shared with Jeffrey Coho
something I shared with you.

19:27.166 --> 19:29.793
I do not expect the things
that I tell my assistant

19:29.877 --> 19:33.505
in the privacy of my office
to end up in the office gossip pool.

19:34.214 --> 19:35.966
Things I share with my boyfriend,

19:36.258 --> 19:38.969
I especially expect to stay private.

19:39.803 --> 19:41.096
I'm, uh... (clears throat)

19:42.097 --> 19:44.016
I'm your boyfriend?

19:44.433 --> 19:46.268
Well, we're dating.

19:46.894 --> 19:49.146
It may not be exclusive, but even so--

19:49.354 --> 19:50.606
(in deep masculine voice) You're just
getting a little ahead of yourself,

19:50.689 --> 19:51.565
don't you think, child?

19:52.065 --> 19:53.901
If I was your boyfriend, you'd know.

19:54.109 --> 19:57.070
You'd be doing my laundry,
making me dinner every night.

19:57.154 --> 19:58.906
I don't see you doing that, sugar-pop.

19:59.865 --> 20:01.033
You think you're funny.

20:02.618 --> 20:03.493
Rule number two--

20:03.827 --> 20:07.331
when it comes to us, I do not want
to be hearing from the peanut gallery,

20:07.581 --> 20:12.002
which includes Clarice, Clevant, Oprah
and whoever else you have stored in there.

20:12.836 --> 20:13.670
Claire,

20:15.505 --> 20:17.841
could we be exclusive?

20:20.093 --> 20:20.928
Well...

20:22.471 --> 20:23.722
I suppose we could try.

20:27.267 --> 20:29.311
In that case, I quit.

20:30.604 --> 20:32.689
-What?
-I can't work for my girlfriend.

20:33.523 --> 20:34.608
Can you get me reassigned?

20:36.360 --> 20:37.194
(sighs)

20:37.486 --> 20:39.947
Well, we tell everyone
who comes to Better Tomorrows

20:40.030 --> 20:41.823
that self-control, not indulgence,

20:41.907 --> 20:43.617
-is the path to grace.
-Huh!

20:45.118 --> 20:46.954
What exactly does that mean?

20:47.871 --> 20:50.874
Same-sex attraction
is a pernicious disorder.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.919
Reparative therapy
will give a patient the tools

20:54.002 --> 20:56.755
to maintain his sobriety,
but he has to want to change.

20:57.798 --> 20:59.800
Frankly, Mr. Brown didn't try hard enough.

21:00.259 --> 21:03.095
We didn't fail him. He failed himself.

21:03.679 --> 21:08.016
How long has your exciting
and revolutionary rehabilitation facility

21:08.100 --> 21:09.726
been open, if I may ask?

21:10.060 --> 21:13.146
We started with our first
discipleship program in 1974.

21:13.230 --> 21:16.024
Now we have several ministry houses
throughout New England.

21:16.108 --> 21:17.859
And this treatment works?

21:17.943 --> 21:21.613
One third of our patients go on to have
long-term heterosexual relationships.

21:21.697 --> 21:23.949
One third show significant improvement,

21:24.408 --> 21:28.036
while still engaging occasionally
in inappropriate relations.

21:28.370 --> 21:29.538
And the final third?

21:29.871 --> 21:31.206
I'm afraid they show no improvement

21:31.290 --> 21:34.084
and continue to engage
in homosexual behavior.

21:35.043 --> 21:37.462
But they have the decency
to hate themselves for it.

21:37.754 --> 21:39.214
Objection. Badgering.

21:40.090 --> 21:41.967
-No, wait. She's our badger.
-Overruled.

21:44.594 --> 21:46.305
Are you licensed by the state?

21:46.888 --> 21:48.098
We're a faith-based initiative.

21:48.473 --> 21:51.018
-Is that a "no"?
-We are not licensed.

21:51.101 --> 21:54.062
Are you endorsed
by the American Psychiatric Association?

21:54.396 --> 21:56.440
Regretfully, in 1973,

21:56.523 --> 21:59.318
the American Psychiatric Association
bowed to pressure

21:59.401 --> 22:01.028
from the homosexual lobby and declared

22:01.111 --> 22:03.739
that same-sex attraction
was not a mental disorder.

22:04.906 --> 22:06.825
We consider ourselves
one of the last bulwarks

22:06.908 --> 22:08.618
against the homosexual tide.

22:08.702 --> 22:11.496
You took $40,000 from this man

22:11.580 --> 22:14.791
and represented to him
that you would cure him of being gay.

22:14.875 --> 22:17.502
And we would have had he maintained
the discipline and the faith.

22:18.211 --> 22:19.504
He kept up neither.

22:20.464 --> 22:22.299
I'm sorry. Have we won yet?

22:22.382 --> 22:23.717
Mr. Shore!

22:32.434 --> 22:34.102
We're making a big mistake, you know.

22:35.270 --> 22:36.521
Which one are you referring to?

22:36.855 --> 22:40.359
There isn't just one America.
There's at least two, maybe more.

22:41.026 --> 22:44.404
There's your America,
where people are tolerant, progressive,

22:45.072 --> 22:47.824
open-minded about alternative lifestyles.

22:47.908 --> 22:49.117
Then there's the other one,

22:49.493 --> 22:52.371
the one that thinks
homosexuality is a disease,

22:52.454 --> 22:53.914
the one that elects presidents.

22:57.417 --> 23:01.546
There are more people than you think
in that other America, Alan.

23:03.465 --> 23:05.675
We need to try this case in that country.

23:20.232 --> 23:23.026
I first began to have sexual urges
watching football,

23:23.110 --> 23:25.237
especially during goal-line stands.

23:25.737 --> 23:28.031
I sought out Better Tomorrows.
They helped me.

23:28.323 --> 23:32.619
I thought it absurd, quite frankly,
the idea of curing sexual predilections.

23:33.161 --> 23:36.665
But better tomorrows,
by getting me to recommit myself

23:36.748 --> 23:37.624
to my faith, my family,

23:38.125 --> 23:40.794
I absolutely did rid myself
of any gay urges.

23:41.086 --> 23:43.130
I suppose it was a little
like my alcoholism,

23:43.713 --> 23:45.257
which I also beat.

23:45.549 --> 23:49.261
The first four months were hard,
but it got easier.

23:49.553 --> 23:50.971
(in feminine voice)
I never think of men now.

23:52.222 --> 23:55.016
Oh, my god. The idea totally repulses me.

24:01.565 --> 24:03.483
A sexual assault is traumatic.

24:03.775 --> 24:05.444
I realize that. Of course I do.

24:06.695 --> 24:08.238
Well, if you can lessen
your daughter's pain,

24:08.321 --> 24:10.615
-why wouldn't you?
-It works on the brain.

24:10.699 --> 24:14.870
For god sakes, the idea
that you just take a pill

24:14.953 --> 24:17.873
-every time something bad happens...
-That's bad?

24:18.165 --> 24:21.376
It's called life, and you can't just erase
the bad parts.

24:21.877 --> 24:23.378
-Why not?
-Our best artists

24:23.462 --> 24:25.130
are informed by their pain.

24:25.464 --> 24:28.216
Our greatest heroes
are born out of adversity.

24:28.675 --> 24:31.470
Certainly, if the trauma
affects your life, treat it,

24:31.553 --> 24:34.347
either behaviorally or with medication.

24:34.431 --> 24:37.225
But some miracle amnesia pill,

24:37.434 --> 24:39.853
so you have no memory of bad things,

24:40.770 --> 24:43.356
what kind of brave new world
are we entering into?

24:43.857 --> 24:45.442
When Michelle was born, you vaccinated her

24:45.525 --> 24:47.152
-against polio, didn't you?
-Yes.

24:47.444 --> 24:49.321
-The measles?
-Of course.

24:49.404 --> 24:51.990
-You gave her a P.D.T. shot?
-Those are known diseases.

24:52.073 --> 24:54.159
So is post-traumatic stress disorder.

24:54.242 --> 24:55.827
She may not develop P.T.S.D.

24:56.286 --> 24:58.455
She didn't have whooping cough,
but you still gave her the shot,

24:58.747 --> 25:00.957
because you preemptively
wanted to protect her,

25:01.291 --> 25:02.417
as any good mother would.

25:02.709 --> 25:04.211
Now you have the chance to protect her

25:04.294 --> 25:06.379
from a potentially
life-threatening disorder

25:06.630 --> 25:08.965
by simply giving her this pill
in a timely matter.

25:09.049 --> 25:12.511
I just don't agree with it. I'm sorry.

25:12.969 --> 25:17.432
Well, as your daughter suggested,
how about we let it be<i> her </i>choice,

25:17.724 --> 25:19.518
since it's<i> her </i>life we're talking about?

25:23.647 --> 25:26.233
Is it just me,
or are you getting your clock cleaned?

25:30.987 --> 25:34.157
Okay, so, um, how do I say this?

25:34.699 --> 25:35.534
Just say it.

25:35.867 --> 25:39.329
Just out of curiosity,
what do you want the answer to be?

25:39.621 --> 25:41.206
My curiosity trumps yours.

25:42.123 --> 25:43.083
What are the results, Denise?

25:48.255 --> 25:49.256
(sighs)

25:50.006 --> 25:52.717
-it's yours.
-Oh, my god.

25:59.849 --> 26:00.850
Have you thought about schools?

26:02.686 --> 26:03.520
Not just yet.

26:03.812 --> 26:04.854
-(door opens)
-(knock on door)

26:05.313 --> 26:07.357
-What's going on?
-The results are back.

26:08.233 --> 26:09.276
-Really?
-Yeah.

26:12.779 --> 26:16.449
-And?
-And it's Brad's. You're off the hook.

26:16.992 --> 26:17.826
Oh.

26:21.538 --> 26:24.541
What a relief. Congratulations.

26:25.041 --> 26:25.875
Yeah.

26:27.335 --> 26:29.462
And you, of course. Congratulations.

26:31.047 --> 26:32.007
We are sure it's yours?

26:32.465 --> 26:33.842
-It's likely.
-Well...

26:34.467 --> 26:35.594
congratulations again.

26:53.862 --> 26:57.949
A catastrophic flood,
a man is on his roof.

26:58.158 --> 27:01.453
The floodwaters rise,
inching closer to his heels

27:01.536 --> 27:03.330
as he clings to the chimney.

27:03.413 --> 27:04.664
A rowboat passes.

27:04.748 --> 27:08.251
"Get in my rowboat or you'll certainly
drown," says the man in the boat.

27:08.710 --> 27:12.380
"No, God will save me,"
answers the man on the roof.

27:12.589 --> 27:13.923
A motorboat passes.

27:14.007 --> 27:16.176
"Get in or you'll certainly drown."

27:16.259 --> 27:19.638
"No," says the man on the roof,
"God will save me."

27:19.721 --> 27:22.932
Now a helicopter flies over
and the pilot shouts,

27:23.016 --> 27:25.977
"Climb up this ladder to me
or you'll certainly drown."

27:26.061 --> 27:29.731
"No, God will save me."
And the helicopter flies off,

27:29.814 --> 27:31.858
and the man drowns.

27:32.275 --> 27:33.735
And when the man gets to Heaven,

27:34.194 --> 27:38.031
he says, "Lord, why didn't you save me?"

27:38.239 --> 27:41.951
And God says, "I sent you a rowboat,

27:42.035 --> 27:44.663
a motorboat, a helicopter."

27:44.954 --> 27:48.458
Now judge Brown
is the man on the roof, drowning,

27:48.541 --> 27:52.379
waiting for a miracle,
dismissing practical solutions.

27:52.462 --> 27:55.048
My client gave him the tools,
the guidelines,

27:55.131 --> 27:57.092
the map to achieve the goal,

27:57.175 --> 27:59.636
to be cured, to be rescued.

27:59.719 --> 28:03.056
Judge Brown rejected those tools
that had worked for so many.

28:03.139 --> 28:08.436
And now he asks the justice system
to punish my client,

28:08.520 --> 28:14.734
when all my client did was see the flood
and send the boat.

28:30.542 --> 28:31.918
What are you doing?

28:32.001 --> 28:34.045
Climbing on my soapbox, Judge.
I do it once a week.

28:34.129 --> 28:36.548
Get off that thing now, Mr. Shore.

28:36.798 --> 28:39.592
You sure? This is vintage soapbox stuff.

28:39.843 --> 28:44.681
You've got God, money,
politics, homosexuality.

28:44.764 --> 28:47.726
Has anyone ever heard
of restless leg syndrome?

28:47.809 --> 28:50.145
It's where you move your leg about
in your sleep.

28:50.520 --> 28:52.439
It's awful. You may have it.

28:52.897 --> 28:54.315
It may not keep you awake.

28:54.399 --> 28:57.819
It doesn't really harm you in any way.
It may not bother you in the slightest,

28:57.902 --> 28:59.070
but nonetheless, it's awful.

28:59.154 --> 29:00.905
The pharmaceutical companies
have declared it so.

29:00.989 --> 29:04.701
So they've invented a drug,
and you simply must take it.

29:04.784 --> 29:07.078
If you haven't heard of restless leg,
by the way,

29:07.162 --> 29:08.997
you probably have
attention deficit disorder.

29:09.080 --> 29:11.499
Awful. We've got a lot of drugs
for that one.

29:11.583 --> 29:12.459
You must take them.

29:14.043 --> 29:14.878
You're depressed.

29:15.920 --> 29:17.213
You're not sleeping enough.

29:17.297 --> 29:18.256
You think you're shy,

29:18.339 --> 29:22.427
but you've actually got
a social anxiety disorder.

29:22.510 --> 29:25.054
Weak stream, irritable bowel syndrome.

29:25.138 --> 29:28.183
You people have all kinds of ailments
you don't know about.

29:28.433 --> 29:30.727
Luckily, we've got drugs
for every one of them.

29:30.810 --> 29:31.728
You must take them.

29:32.187 --> 29:35.398
My colleague has a case
involving a forgetting pill.

29:35.482 --> 29:39.152
You can take that one to forget you ever
had restless leg or irritable bowels.

29:39.235 --> 29:41.362
Mr. Shore, what are you talking about?

29:41.446 --> 29:43.364
Same-sex attraction disorder.

29:44.157 --> 29:48.077
And what troubles me
is why the folks in big pharmaceutical

29:48.161 --> 29:50.413
haven't invented a pill for this disease.

29:50.497 --> 29:52.373
Clearly, they're in the business
of selling sickness.

29:52.457 --> 29:54.584
If there was a profit to be made,
they would make it.

29:54.793 --> 29:58.922
And with an estimated gay population
of over ten million in the U.S. alone,

29:59.005 --> 30:00.548
there's certainly a big enough market.

30:00.840 --> 30:02.509
Could it be that they<i> can't </i>cure it?

30:03.134 --> 30:04.219
Well, not to worry.

30:04.302 --> 30:08.014
If big pharmaceutical can't do it,
maybe big religion can, and they are.

30:08.389 --> 30:11.059
They're the ones who have coined the term
"same-sex attraction disorder."

30:11.142 --> 30:14.521
It's a very good name.
Very important, a good name.

30:14.771 --> 30:17.774
It's a crucial first step
in disqualifying homosexuals

30:17.857 --> 30:21.069
as a segment of the population
and categorizing them as a disease.

30:21.152 --> 30:24.656
It makes homosexuals seem less like people
and more like the flu,

30:25.406 --> 30:29.702
and with terrible, awful symptoms,
but curable.

30:30.537 --> 30:32.705
And therefore less concerning
when it comes to things

30:32.789 --> 30:37.961
like an individual's rights,
freedom, privacy, marriage.

30:38.211 --> 30:41.422
Big religion is very concerned
with marriage.

30:41.506 --> 30:44.050
Big religion is the one
filling the pockets of Congress.

30:44.133 --> 30:48.012
It actually got them to propose
a constitutional ban on gay marriage.

30:48.096 --> 30:49.097
Think about that.

30:49.180 --> 30:52.183
A governmentally imposed
systematic prejudice

30:52.267 --> 30:54.686
against a class
based on their sexual orientation.

30:54.894 --> 30:58.356
Never mind that one of the most
trusted evangelical advisors

30:58.439 --> 31:01.150
to the president was himself having
a homosexual affair on the side.

31:01.234 --> 31:02.652
Never mind that one of our congressmen

31:02.735 --> 31:05.321
was writing naughty e-mails
to his teenage male pages.

31:05.405 --> 31:07.657
Isn't it just a disease?
And I thought it was curable.

31:07.740 --> 31:09.868
That's what they told me
down at the church.

31:10.577 --> 31:14.080
Well, you can legislate against it.

31:14.163 --> 31:16.165
You can give it a clever name
and treat people for it.

31:16.249 --> 31:17.834
You can shut your eyes,
have sex with your wife

31:17.917 --> 31:20.086
and pretend it all feels right.

31:20.169 --> 31:22.881
You can join the church and swear
to be celibate for the rest of your life.

31:22.964 --> 31:24.924
You can drive around on a Saturday night
with a baseball bat

31:25.008 --> 31:27.260
and try to beat it out of some poor soul
you happen to meet.

31:27.343 --> 31:29.304
You can even come
to this courtroom and testify

31:29.387 --> 31:31.764
as to your new leaf
and how well it's all working.

31:31.848 --> 31:35.852
What a miracle. My only response is,
"Give it time. We'll see."

31:36.436 --> 31:40.481
Meanwhile, this company took
$40,000 from my client,

31:40.565 --> 31:42.317
promising to cure him of his gayness.

31:42.400 --> 31:46.112
Only in America. Only in a country
that overtly and notoriously

31:46.195 --> 31:49.032
celebrates its prejudice
against a class of people

31:49.115 --> 31:51.034
by proposing constitutional amendments.

31:51.326 --> 31:53.536
God bless us all. Home of the brave!

31:54.078 --> 31:54.913
Shame on you.

31:55.163 --> 31:57.123
Couldn't you have at least offered
a money-back guarantee

31:57.206 --> 31:58.291
and thrown in a blender?

32:16.726 --> 32:20.104
My filing system isn't that difficult.
I throw everything out.

32:20.188 --> 32:21.856
-I can improve that.
-What's going on?

32:22.941 --> 32:25.443
Clarence works for me now.
Tell him why, Clarence.

32:26.361 --> 32:28.655
Claire and I are involved.

32:28.738 --> 32:31.366
Well, well, well. (chuckles)

32:32.867 --> 32:33.701
(lowered voice) Hey, listen.

32:33.993 --> 32:38.456
I've had almost every daytime
talk show hostess except the big one.

32:38.539 --> 32:40.667
Do you think you could get
your assistant to dress up

32:40.750 --> 32:42.835
and come over to my office
every once in a while?

32:43.962 --> 32:45.088
Denny, he's a guy.

32:45.546 --> 32:48.383
If he can pretend he's Oprah all day,

32:49.467 --> 32:51.177
I should be able to buy it
for two minutes.

32:52.220 --> 32:53.096
But he's a guy.

32:53.888 --> 32:55.431
Do I need to put you in rehab?

32:56.224 --> 32:57.058
You're right.

32:57.392 --> 33:00.103
Mr. Shore, your jury's back.

33:05.608 --> 33:08.361
iPods, cell phones, Google.

33:08.820 --> 33:11.155
How odd were these concepts
just a short time ago?

33:11.531 --> 33:12.991
Now they're completely commonplace.

33:13.408 --> 33:16.285
In five years,
using propranolol to treat P.T.S.D.

33:16.619 --> 33:19.914
might become commonplace too,
and we won't be having this argument.

33:20.873 --> 33:23.543
But Michelle Cabot-Levinson
doesn't have five years.

33:24.377 --> 33:25.420
She needs it now.

33:27.422 --> 33:30.174
And we're not talking about some new drug
that just came out of a lab.

33:30.258 --> 33:33.094
It's been prescribed by doctors
for nearly 50 years,

33:33.428 --> 33:35.096
albeit for a different purpose.

33:35.430 --> 33:39.392
It is undeniably safe
and so far, seems very effective.

33:39.892 --> 33:41.936
If this young girl
had a life-threatening infection

33:42.645 --> 33:45.314
and one of her parents
wanted to deny her antibiotics,

33:45.398 --> 33:46.399
we wouldn't hesitate.

33:46.649 --> 33:48.109
This case is no different.

33:48.192 --> 33:51.070
Michelle is at risk
of a lifelong disability.

33:51.154 --> 33:52.697
Why are we hesitating?

33:53.740 --> 33:55.533
Because the research is still out

33:55.616 --> 33:58.911
on whether or not
this propranolol actually works,

33:59.287 --> 34:01.956
to say nothing of what
the long-term effects might be.

34:02.248 --> 34:03.708
And the research is still coming in

34:03.791 --> 34:05.918
on the dangers of suppressing memories,
by the way,

34:06.002 --> 34:09.839
but that's a-a whole other bag
of emotional scarring.

34:10.298 --> 34:12.717
But this case isn't about any of that.

34:12.800 --> 34:16.012
This case is about
what makes us who we are.

34:16.763 --> 34:17.972
There are lots of answers,

34:18.056 --> 34:23.227
but certainly one possible answer
is we are the sum of our experiences,

34:24.187 --> 34:26.939
not just the good,
not just the bad, but all of them.

34:27.273 --> 34:30.985
If we can take a pill and forget parts
of our personal histories,

34:31.360 --> 34:32.361
who are we then?

34:34.530 --> 34:38.326
When Arthur Hallam died,
his best friend was shocked,

34:38.868 --> 34:41.496
grief-stricken, utterly inconsolable.

34:41.704 --> 34:45.083
But that best friend
was the great English poet Tennyson,

34:45.374 --> 34:48.002
who went on to write<i> In Memoriam</i>.

34:48.086 --> 34:49.962
He immortalized his friend in verse

34:50.171 --> 34:53.758
and gave us one of the greatest poems
in the English language.

34:54.217 --> 34:56.511
Imagine if Tennyson
could have just taken a pill

34:56.594 --> 34:58.638
and forgotten about the whole thing.

34:58.721 --> 35:02.141
Did Tennyson have a bad experience
with a rabbi?

35:04.227 --> 35:07.271
Your Honor, this girl is a teenager.

35:07.730 --> 35:12.860
Yes, one who's looking to avoid
post-traumatic distress.

35:13.653 --> 35:17.323
If the drug works,
why not let her have it, for God's sake?

35:17.657 --> 35:20.576
Because it's a form of mind control.

35:20.910 --> 35:23.621
Our memories, our experiences,
that's who we are.

35:24.038 --> 35:27.458
Are we really prepared to turn that over
to the drug companies, too?

35:45.309 --> 35:47.937
I don't like the way
that one on the left is looking at me.

35:48.020 --> 35:49.814
That's the one with irritable bowels.

35:51.065 --> 35:52.316
Madam Foreperson,

35:52.400 --> 35:55.027
-has the jury reached its verdict?
-Yes, Judge.

35:56.112 --> 35:59.282
We find for the plaintiff
and award compensatory damages

35:59.365 --> 36:03.161
in the amount of $40,000,
plus interest and punitive damages

36:03.244 --> 36:05.371
in the amount of $350,000.

36:05.621 --> 36:09.375
Your Honor, ask that the jury
be polled for sexual orientation.

36:10.585 --> 36:12.962
I'm sure that there is
a congressional bill afoot

36:13.045 --> 36:14.839
that would allow me to do so, counsel,

36:14.922 --> 36:17.800
but it hasn't been enacted yet.
The verdict stands.

36:18.050 --> 36:20.553
We're adjourned. The jury's free to go,

36:20.636 --> 36:23.472
and this case is officially over.

36:24.765 --> 36:29.353
Please do not think that this entitles you
to any special favors from the bench.

36:29.854 --> 36:31.814
Let's go, Alan. It's scotch time.

36:32.106 --> 36:36.027
I first need to see a judge about a,
well, a special favor.

36:39.906 --> 36:42.491
(rock music playing)

36:49.832 --> 36:51.751
(moaning)

36:53.377 --> 36:54.378
(exhales deeply)

36:55.463 --> 36:57.465
I'm gonna hate myself in the morning.

36:59.592 --> 37:01.928
There are two morning-after pills
you can take now,

37:02.595 --> 37:04.847
one to forget this whole thing
ever happened.

37:06.224 --> 37:08.559
Of course, I suppose
you should take that one second.

37:15.983 --> 37:17.193
-(knock on door)
-Hey.

37:18.027 --> 37:19.403
Don't mean to nag you.
Have you thought about schools yet?

37:19.904 --> 37:21.948
You have to start applying early
for these preschools,

37:22.031 --> 37:24.784
or else you basically give up any chance
of getting into a decent college.

37:25.243 --> 37:27.286
Oh, what about the amnio?
We should discuss that.

37:27.703 --> 37:28.663
Um, Brad...

37:30.081 --> 37:32.750
-I'm not sure I'm going to have it.
-What do you mean?

37:32.833 --> 37:37.546
I mean, I-- I don't know whether
I'm going to have this child.

37:39.465 --> 37:42.343
Denise, if you're thinking
about what I think

37:42.426 --> 37:44.011
you're thinking about,
you can just forget it.

37:44.095 --> 37:47.515
-It's my decision to make, not yours.
-Yes, the rights of the woman.

37:47.765 --> 37:49.934
-Well, the child has rights, as well.
-I'm not engaging

37:50.017 --> 37:50.851
-in this discussion with you.
-And as the father, I'm gonna stand up...

37:50.935 --> 37:52.186
-Brad!
-Let me tell you something, Denise.

37:52.270 --> 37:54.563
No child who was aborted
ever grew up to be anything.

37:56.399 --> 37:58.901
I have an incredibly difficult decision
to make.

37:58.985 --> 38:02.446
I will not have you charging in my office
quoting bumper stickers.

38:02.530 --> 38:04.240
And I will not have you just decide.

38:04.323 --> 38:06.909
If I have to get a restraining order
against you, I will do it.

38:14.750 --> 38:21.757
Post-traumatic stress disorder is bad,
but brainwashing is bad, too.

38:22.508 --> 38:25.177
And spinach is bad.

38:25.845 --> 38:27.054
I'm not going to eat it.

38:28.681 --> 38:29.515
Where was I?

38:30.808 --> 38:36.439
Oh, I'm granting the T.R.O.
Propane will not be given

38:36.522 --> 38:39.734
-to Michelle Cabot-Levinson.
-(bangs gavel)

38:39.817 --> 38:41.652
-Thank you.
-Thank you, Shirley.

38:42.570 --> 38:44.113
Let's hope we did the right thing.

38:47.074 --> 38:48.117
I think we did.

39:01.088 --> 39:01.922
Alan...

39:03.758 --> 39:04.592
I have a theory.

39:05.384 --> 39:06.844
Maybe instead of mad cow,

39:08.637 --> 39:11.724
somebody's been grinding up
that forgetting pill

39:11.807 --> 39:13.517
and putting it in my hamburger. (chuckles)

39:13.601 --> 39:16.479
So I'll forget the bad thing
they did to me, and I won't seek revenge.

39:17.772 --> 39:19.190
See? It's working already.

39:20.399 --> 39:21.901
What are you doing on that thing?

39:22.360 --> 39:24.445
I meant to climb on Bethany,
but she wasn't on it.

39:25.488 --> 39:27.031
This thing is intuitive, you know.

39:27.948 --> 39:29.325
Which is great, 'cause I'm not.

39:30.868 --> 39:32.578
Denny, you won the day again.

39:33.412 --> 39:35.706
You reminded me
of that other America out there.

39:36.040 --> 39:37.666
Who teaches them their values?

39:38.459 --> 39:40.836
Well, for fidelity and family,

39:40.920 --> 39:43.464
we have, uh, Jim Bakker
and Jimmy Swaggart.

39:44.715 --> 39:46.801
For heterosexuality
and keeping with God's will,

39:46.884 --> 39:47.927
we have Ted Haggard.

39:48.177 --> 39:51.138
For gambling, we have Bill Bennett,
and for guns, Dick Cheney.

39:52.098 --> 39:54.517
But to deny an entire class of people

39:54.600 --> 39:56.644
one of their basic individual freedoms...

39:56.727 --> 39:59.313
Alan, you're talking about marriage,

39:59.563 --> 40:01.440
an institution with sacred vows,

40:01.941 --> 40:04.527
ones which we live up to
almost 50 percent of the time.

40:04.610 --> 40:05.820
It's a sanctity.

40:05.903 --> 40:10.032
Even so, we've got millions of homosexuals
in this country, for God's sake.

40:10.116 --> 40:11.367
Most of them Republicans.

40:11.450 --> 40:13.536
How do you feel about this issue, Denny?

40:15.746 --> 40:16.914
I'm all for gay rights,

40:18.416 --> 40:19.500
but letting them marry,

40:19.917 --> 40:21.752
do we really want them
to have children together?

40:22.086 --> 40:24.713
I mean, two biologically gay parents?

40:25.047 --> 40:27.133
Imagine what kind of an army
we would have,

40:27.508 --> 40:28.676
other than a happy one.

40:29.552 --> 40:31.053
It's definitely mad cow.

40:31.137 --> 40:36.225
But I believe, if we truly
are a nation of human rights,

40:36.308 --> 40:37.143
and I think we are,

40:37.601 --> 40:40.229
we gotta walk the walk,
not just talk the talk.

40:40.312 --> 40:42.898
But the problem with gay rights,
especially when it comes to marriage,

40:42.982 --> 40:45.484
is we don't even talk the talk
in this country,

40:45.568 --> 40:46.402
so the walk...

40:47.278 --> 40:50.865
Ask me, there's only one real solution.

40:51.073 --> 40:51.907
Tell me.

40:55.786 --> 40:56.704
All those homosexuals,

40:56.787 --> 40:59.248
they join the NRA,
take over the gun lobby.

40:59.331 --> 41:01.750
Congress bends over
and does whatever they want.

41:01.834 --> 41:03.836
-A gay gun lobby?
-It's the only answer.

41:03.919 --> 41:05.045
(chuckles) I like it.

41:07.756 --> 41:09.341
Hey, you want to have a sleepover tonight?

41:09.675 --> 41:12.052
-I knew you'd go there.
-We could watch a movie.

41:12.136 --> 41:15.264
Every time I say something you agree with,

41:15.639 --> 41:17.057
you trot out the sleepover idea.

41:17.141 --> 41:19.393
-It's sexual harassment.
-Popcorn?

41:19.477 --> 41:21.228
-Not interested.
-S'mores.

41:21.687 --> 41:23.939
-Old-fashioned graham crackers?
-Is there anything else?

41:24.023 --> 41:25.566
-<i>Guns of Navarone?</i>
-If you'd like.

41:25.649 --> 41:28.486
-Separate beds.
-You bring the scotch.

41:37.453 --> 41:38.621
NARRATOR:<i> Next on </i>Boston Legal...

41:38.704 --> 41:40.372
-Represent you?
-Yes.

41:40.623 --> 41:41.707
A-against Denise?

41:41.957 --> 41:43.792
-For having your baby?
-For not having it.

41:43.876 --> 41:45.252
-Word is you're gonna have the baby.
-Yeah.

41:45.336 --> 41:48.047
-We are sure it's Brad's.
-What is my client charged with?

41:48.130 --> 41:49.757
-First degree murder.
-You killed a man.

41:49.840 --> 41:51.050
I was his slave.

41:51.133 --> 41:53.469
Did the judge know
you've never practiced before

41:53.552 --> 41:55.429
-when he assigned you this?
-I can do this.

41:55.513 --> 41:57.223
I've gotten myself slightly arrested.

41:57.306 --> 41:58.724
Please tell me you didn't shoot somebody.

41:58.807 --> 42:00.100
You know where I can find a good lawyer?

42:00.184 --> 42:01.894
I'm going to have to put you on the stand.

42:01.977 --> 42:04.605
You ask the questions.
I'll answer them from deep in here.

42:04.688 --> 42:07.441
You're goin' down, Denny Crane, at last.

42:08.734 --> 42:11.737
