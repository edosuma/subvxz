about Akbar having a wife

04:02.408 --> 04:03.943
But the social media post

{\an1}But the fact that
he's coming off, like, weird?

04:11.684 --> 04:13.252
That's why he's trying
to isolate her,

04:13.319 --> 04:15.655
because he is up
to some bull(bleep)

So if I'm gonna go
work with anyone

07:19.839 --> 07:21.808
or just vent to anyone,
I feel really comfortable

07:21.874 --> 07:24.777
to talk to Roccstar because
we've been friends for a while.

07:34.887 --> 07:36.556
He ain't seeing me right now.

07:36.622 --> 07:38.825
{\an1}'Cause this is what

07:38.891 --> 07:41.027
{\an5}Did you break up with A1?

I don't know what Lyrica saw
in the guy with the pearls

08:01.747 --> 08:04.317
but she's got ten times
more talent than him,

08:04.383 --> 08:05.952
and I know she's
sexually deprived.

08:06.018 --> 08:08.921
His day is done,

{\an5}nobody cared.

08:13.292 --> 08:15.194
{\an1}You know,
he asked me one time,

08:15.261 --> 08:16.596
{\an1}he's like,
"Do you know who I am?"

08:16.662 --> 08:18.731
{\an5}Ah! "Do you know
who I am?"

08:16.662 --> 08:18.731
Yes! He was like--

08:18.798 --> 08:19.799
I do know who you are,
actually!

08:25.738 --> 08:29.976

14:09.415 --> 14:11.217
Brooke treated-- treated--

14:11.283 --> 14:12.484
{\an1}she said we got
a surrogate.

14:12.551 --> 14:13.752
{\an1}She said "I ain't even
wanna have a baby anyway."

14:13.819 --> 14:16.088
{\an6}What?!

14:13.819 --> 14:16.088
What the (bleep)?

14:16.155 --> 14:18.090
Yeah. I'ma take her
down to the clinic,

14:18.157 --> 14:19.458
and get a blood test.

14:19.525 --> 14:20.693
She's a little late,
so we just gonna see

14:20.759 --> 14:21.894
{\an1}what happens,
you know what I mean?

14:21.961 --> 14:23.929
Now, the crazy part is
I'm talkin' to Brooke,

14:23.996 --> 14:25.264
{\an1}I catch her
going through my phone,

14:25.331 --> 14:26.665
{\an1}you know I'm sayin',
'cause Stassia had

14:26.732 --> 14:28.267
already sent me the address.

14:28.334 --> 14:29.835
{\an5}So she got the address--

14:28.334 --> 14:29.835
To the clinic?

14:29.902 --> 14:31.537
To the clinic.

14:29.902 --> 14:31.537
{\an3}Oh, no!

14:31.604 --> 14:33.405
And so she-- yeah, so she
just makin' it difficult.

14:33.472 --> 14:34.974
Like, "I'ma come down there.

14:35.040 --> 14:37.443
{\an1}We gonna have a blood test
for <i> our</i> baby.

14:37.509 --> 14:39.278
I ain't gonna lie, bro,
I-- I love Brooke,

14:39.345 --> 14:41.313
but...

14:39.345 --> 14:41.313
But what, bro?

14:41.380 --> 14:43.515
We know Brooke got
a little cuckoo clock.

14:43.582 --> 14:45.017
{\an1}I'm not gonna sit here
and act like

14:45.084 --> 14:46.952
{\an5}I don't know she crazy.

14:45.084 --> 14:46.952
You like it?

14:47.019 --> 14:49.755
{\an4}I love it,
you know what I mean?

14:47.019 --> 14:49.755
What the...?

14:49.822 --> 14:51.523
(Marcus)
Okay, Brooke's crazy, yes.

14:51.590 --> 14:52.958
But I gotta be honest,
the way she been

14:53.025 --> 14:54.827
going hard for me
over the last couple weeks

14:54.893 --> 14:56.562
kinda got me
reconsidering things.

14:56.629 --> 14:58.163
(Solo)
Dude, she got sisters

14:58.230 --> 14:59.732
{\an5}or cousins
I need to know.

14:58.230 --> 14:59.732
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:59.798 --> 15:01.600
{\an4}(Loyd)
What up, man?

14:59.798 --> 15:01.600
What up?

15:01.667 --> 15:04.236
Yo, you came, bro.
No round two, right?

15:04.303 --> 15:06.639
Nah, no round two, man,

15:06.705 --> 15:07.640
it ain't nothin'
like that, bro.

15:09.541 --> 15:12.144
{\an5}(A1)
Even though things
got intense the other night

15:12.211 --> 15:14.446
at dinner with Moms,
I invited Loyd

15:14.513 --> 15:16.582
and his wife Patrice
to my show tonight.

15:16.649 --> 15:18.984
I'm glad he accepted
the olive branch,

15:19.051 --> 15:21.487
and maybe he was right
about Lyrica being the problem.

15:21.553 --> 15:23.322
What up, man?
Thanks for coming.

15:23.389 --> 15:25.724
Yeah, you know we had
to come show some support.

15:25.791 --> 15:27.559
You know what I'm saying?
But, uh, the last time,

15:27.626 --> 15:29.962
me, Mom, and you
had the dinner.

15:30.029 --> 15:32.031
{\an8}Things went left,
you know?

15:32.097 --> 15:34.633
{\an5}(scoffs)
Yeah.

15:32.097 --> 15:34.633
So man to man,

15:34.700 --> 15:37.036
{\an1}I apologize
and I'm sorry, brother.

15:37.102 --> 15:39.672
{\an5}That was nice.

15:37.102 --> 15:39.672
That's a'ight,
right there.

15:39.738 --> 15:40.939
(overlapping chatter)

15:41.006 --> 15:43.275
Real (bleep),
I apologize.

15:43.342 --> 15:44.610
I been thinking about
a lot of (bleep)

15:44.677 --> 15:46.612
you was saying about Lyrica.

15:46.679 --> 15:48.614
{\an5}Yeah

15:46.679 --> 15:48.614
And to be honest, bro...

15:48.681 --> 15:52.351
I-- I think we gonna
get a divorce.

15:52.418 --> 15:55.254
What?

15:55.321 --> 15:56.989
For real?
You serious, man?

15:57.056 --> 15:58.791
{\an5}(Solo)
I knew things was getting
a little rough in paradise,

15:58.857 --> 16:00.225
but a divorce?

16:00.292 --> 16:02.094
I just hope that
the strip party I threw

16:02.161 --> 16:04.930
is not the reason that all this
(bleep) is going down, man.

16:04.997 --> 16:06.999
{\an7}And I don't support divorce,
but Lyrica,

16:07.066 --> 16:08.434
{\an8}she's a lot to deal with.

16:08.500 --> 16:10.202
{\an7}And she don't
take responsibility
for nothin' she do.

16:10.269 --> 16:12.304
{\an1}She been trippin'
with everybody,

16:12.371 --> 16:14.506
and it's all behind Lyrica.

16:14.573 --> 16:15.541
(Teairra)
Hey!

16:15.607 --> 16:19.144
Hey!

16:15.607 --> 16:19.144
{\an1}Hey!

16:19.211 --> 16:20.646
Thought I wasn't gonna
see you no more.

16:20.713 --> 16:22.748
{\an1}I know, you sure got
the end of this performance.

16:22.815 --> 16:23.882
It's good to see you.

16:23.949 --> 16:26.251
You got you--
eyes outside.

16:26.318 --> 16:27.786
Akbar's editing the video.

16:27.853 --> 16:29.555
{\an8}The other night,
(bleep) got really crazy.

16:29.621 --> 16:31.590
{\an7}I don't wanna--
I talked to him about that,

16:31.657 --> 16:32.691
and I wanna apologize.

16:32.758 --> 16:33.792
{\an1}He's good.

16:33.859 --> 16:35.127
(Paris)
But, see, he is good,

16:35.194 --> 16:36.929
but when I looked
on, like, line

16:36.995 --> 16:40.566
{\an1}I saw something on the blogs
that he might be married.

16:40.632 --> 16:43.469
{\an1}Well, he's not married.
That's a lie.

16:43.535 --> 16:47.005
{\an5}(Teairra)
Given how Paris and Nikki's
last encounter with Akbar went,

16:47.072 --> 16:50.776
{\an8}it's not surprising that they go
digging for (bleep) gossip.

16:50.843 --> 16:53.812
But Akbar is so different from
any other guy that I've dated,

16:53.879 --> 16:55.581
and I'm happy.

16:55.647 --> 16:56.715
That's some corny-ass
(bleep), though.

16:56.782 --> 16:58.417
The girl's putting
his last name.

16:58.484 --> 17:00.152
{\an1}What?

17:00.219 --> 17:01.954
And this is recent?

17:02.020 --> 17:03.489
Yeah, he was
posting something.

17:03.555 --> 17:05.691
Just be careful with him.
You know we on your side.

17:05.758 --> 17:06.959
Well, I love you guys--

17:07.025 --> 17:08.861
You know we always
ready for a drive-by.

17:08.926 --> 17:09.962
{\an5}You know?
So just let us know.

17:08.926 --> 17:09.962
{\an1}(laughing)

17:10.028 --> 17:11.663
{\an1}Ain't no damn
drive-by, bitch.

17:11.730 --> 17:13.398
{\an1}All right,
I'll see y'all.

17:13.464 --> 17:15.367
{\an5}(Teairra)
I'm trying to save face
in front of my friends,

17:15.434 --> 17:17.736
but this is so embarrassing.

17:17.803 --> 17:20.372
I really wanna trust
Akbar about this rumor,

17:20.439 --> 17:22.207
but my friends
bringing it back to me?

17:22.273 --> 17:24.143
It just really
makes me wonder.

17:24.209 --> 17:25.711
I'ma get to
the bottom of this.

17:25.778 --> 17:27.880
We gonna dig deep
and find out more (bleep).

17:27.945 --> 17:30.382
Okay, let's do it.

17:30.449 --> 17:31.617
{\an8}(man)
Coming up...

17:31.683 --> 17:33.252
{\an7}(Teairra)
People are really believing

17:33.318 --> 17:35.154
{\an8}that this is your wife,
and I'm looking crazy.

17:35.220 --> 17:36.488
{\an8}I ain't thinking about
no other woman.

17:36.555 --> 17:37.790
{\an8}No, I'm focused on you.

17:37.856 --> 17:40.259
{\an8}That's in my past.

17:40.325 --> 17:41.693
{\an7}You know La'Britney?
She was doing

17:41.760 --> 17:43.662
{\an8}the American joint.

17:41.760 --> 17:43.662
{\an9}Whoa!

17:43.729 --> 17:45.764
{\an8}And that (bleep)--

17:43.729 --> 17:45.764
{\an8}Looks like he's living
his best life.

17:45.831 --> 17:47.399
{\an8}Oh, he living his life.

17:47.466 --> 17:50.502
{\an7}All righty,
so the blood results are back.

17:50.569 --> 17:52.438
{\an9}And...

17:58.744 --> 18:03.515
{\an8}♪♪

18:03.582 --> 18:06.251
{\an8}(Teairra)
The reintroduction
of these marriage rumors

18:06.318 --> 18:09.488
{\an8}has me second guessing
if Akbar is telling the truth.

18:09.555 --> 18:11.824
Now that Nikki and Paris
are telling me

18:11.890 --> 18:14.026
that this bitch is still
posting pictures of Akbar

18:14.092 --> 18:17.129
with his last name,
he got some explaining to do.

18:17.196 --> 18:19.465
{\an5}Hey, sexy.

18:17.196 --> 18:19.465
'Sup, baby?

18:19.531 --> 18:21.400
{\an5}(Teairra)
We're supposed to
be having dinner tonight

18:21.467 --> 18:23.769
so that he can show me
progress on my music video.

18:23.836 --> 18:25.971
Instead, I have to talk
to his ass about this "wife"

18:26.038 --> 18:27.840
making me look like
a homewrecker.

18:27.906 --> 18:29.374
So I got a surprise
for you, though.

18:29.441 --> 18:31.910
{\an5}You gonna love it.

18:29.441 --> 18:31.910
Just like I love you.

18:31.977 --> 18:33.045
Aww!

18:33.111 --> 18:35.581
As long as you're honest.

18:35.647 --> 18:37.316
{\an9}About what?

18:37.382 --> 18:39.318
{\an8}Well, I went to a concert,

18:39.384 --> 18:42.087
{\an1}and, um, I saw
Nikki and Paris there

18:42.154 --> 18:46.191
and they bring up stuff that
we had already talked about.

18:46.258 --> 18:49.928
{\an1}But they're bringing it up as if
it's, like, current.

18:49.995 --> 18:52.831
{\an1}Like, with your ex,
saying that you're married...

18:52.898 --> 18:54.199
{\an5}No, that's--

18:52.898 --> 18:54.199
{\an1}... and they're, like,
a happy family.

18:54.266 --> 18:56.368
{\an6}No.

18:54.266 --> 18:56.368
{\an1}She's like,
"Oh, my hubby."

18:56.435 --> 18:57.870
Baby, what you care
about what they say?

18:57.936 --> 18:59.404
You can't-- you can't be
conscious and thinking

18:59.471 --> 19:01.039
about that all the time.

19:01.106 --> 19:03.809
{\an1}But she's having
your last name up,

19:03.876 --> 19:05.277
{\an1}and people
are really believing

19:05.344 --> 19:07.579
that this is your wife,
and I'm looking crazy.

19:07.646 --> 19:09.815
That's in my past.

19:09.882 --> 19:12.184
{\an5}That's in the past?

19:09.882 --> 19:12.184
Yes.

19:12.251 --> 19:14.987
{\an5}Nothing going on right now?

19:12.251 --> 19:14.987
Nothing's going on.

19:15.053 --> 19:18.223
But y'all would hit it off
if y'all was cool.

19:18.290 --> 19:21.260
You and Sade.

19:21.326 --> 19:22.561
Why you acting like that?

19:22.628 --> 19:23.996
You don't even know her.
I'm just sayin--

19:24.062 --> 19:26.632
I don't want to.

19:24.062 --> 19:26.632
{\an3}Okay.

19:26.698 --> 19:28.834
{\an5}(Teairra)
I don't give a (bleep)
how good we would get along.

19:28.901 --> 19:31.169
Akbar needs to keep his focus
on me and this video

19:31.236 --> 19:32.337
and that's it.

19:32.404 --> 19:34.773
{\an1}This conversation
that I'm having with you

19:34.840 --> 19:38.043
is about clarity.

19:34.840 --> 19:38.043
{\an3}It's clear.

19:38.110 --> 19:39.511
Look, I'm not dealing
with her like that.

19:39.578 --> 19:41.280
And once again,
we cool.

19:41.346 --> 19:44.016
Just-- just relax.

(Lyrica vocalizing)

19:59.631 --> 20:02.334
{\an5}(Lyrica)
Today, I'm recording
a little bit with Roccstar

20:02.401 --> 20:03.702
{\an8}because I just really
need a friend right now.

20:03.769 --> 20:05.704
{\an8}And Roccstar has always
been that to me.

20:05.771 --> 20:08.273
(vocalizing)

20:08.340 --> 20:10.309
But I have to admit,
I definitely regret

20:10.375 --> 20:12.244
talking to Roccstar about
my husband.

20:12.311 --> 20:15.113
{\an5}Whew!

20:12.311 --> 20:15.113
Yeah, that was a vibe.

20:15.180 --> 20:16.315
Yeah, that's a vibe.

20:16.381 --> 20:18.717
{\an8}Little banger.

20:16.381 --> 20:18.717
{\an8}This right here reminds me

20:18.784 --> 20:20.586
{\an7}of when we been
in the studio back--

20:20.652 --> 20:23.922
{\an1}and we just was just vibin',
and it just was different.

20:23.989 --> 20:25.524
But it's just,
like, weird.

20:25.591 --> 20:28.727
{\an1}Like, I haven't really worked
with any other producers

20:28.794 --> 20:31.496
{\an1}outside of our camp
or with A1 in, like, forever.

20:31.563 --> 20:33.398
{\an4}Right.

20:31.563 --> 20:33.398
You know, we have,
like, a whole little...

20:33.465 --> 20:35.000
{\an4}Mmm.

20:33.465 --> 20:35.000
{\an5}... method of operation
we been doin'.

20:35.067 --> 20:37.469
So now I'm just trying
to get used to...

20:37.536 --> 20:40.639
Sorry, you start talkin'
about A1 and y'all camp,

20:40.706 --> 20:41.974
I start falling asleep.

20:42.040 --> 20:44.076
{\an1}I mean,
I just feel like you free.

20:44.142 --> 20:45.444
{\an1}You need to live
a free life.

20:45.510 --> 20:46.745
{\an1}Spread your wings
a little bit

20:46.812 --> 20:48.180
{\an1}and see what's going on,
'cause, like,

20:48.246 --> 20:50.716
{\an1}that (bleep), I seen him
spreading his wings.

20:50.782 --> 20:52.684
What'd you see?

20:50.782 --> 20:52.684
It was like--

20:52.751 --> 20:54.519
Let me just show you,
'cause this is crazy.

20:54.586 --> 20:56.321
I can't believe you ain't
seen this right here.

20:56.388 --> 20:57.956
You know La'Britney?

20:58.023 --> 21:00.892
{\an4}She on stage going off.
I was like-- Oh...

20:58.023 --> 21:00.892
Oh!

21:00.959 --> 21:03.395

27:28.480 --> 27:30.281
she acted like it's old news.

27:30.348 --> 27:32.083
Look at you comin' in.

27:32.150 --> 27:33.718
Lookin' like you
the lead singer

27:33.785 --> 27:35.153
{\an5}in an R&amp;B group.

27:33.785 --> 27:35.153
I'm the only singer.

27:35.220 --> 27:36.788
I know that's right, bitch.

27:36.855 --> 27:38.556
{\an5}(Nikki)
There has to be something
more going on

27:38.623 --> 27:40.325
that TT does not know about.

27:40.392 --> 27:42.127
So Paris set up
a meeting with Sade.

27:42.193 --> 27:44.529
You know, the one that calls
herself "Akbar's wife."

27:44.596 --> 27:46.064
First of all,
how did you even

27:46.131 --> 27:47.565
get this girl to agree
to come here?

27:47.632 --> 27:48.666
She has a clothing line.

27:48.733 --> 27:51.136
{\an7}I reached out to her
on social media,

27:51.202 --> 27:54.139
{\an8}basically told her that

27:54.205 --> 27:56.341
{\an1}you're interested
in investing into her.

27:56.408 --> 27:58.076
So you used me, bitch.
You used me.

27:58.143 --> 27:59.310
{\an1}I told you
I need your help.

27:59.377 --> 28:00.845
{\an1}I set it up,
just play your part.

28:00.912 --> 28:02.047
(Paris)
Look, I had to think fast

28:02.113 --> 28:03.048
to come up with
something quick

28:03.114 --> 28:04.549
and since Nikki got the bags,

28:04.616 --> 28:06.651
why not lie and tell Sade
she want to invest in

28:06.718 --> 28:08.219
her stupid-ass clothing line?

28:08.286 --> 28:09.988
{\an3}Hi, ladies.

28:08.286 --> 28:09.988
{\an1}Hi!

28:10.055 --> 28:12.057
How are you?

28:10.055 --> 28:12.057
{\an3}Good.

28:12.123 --> 28:13.525
Thank you
for having me.

28:13.591 --> 28:14.959
You're welcome.
Nikki, nice to meet you.

28:15.026 --> 28:17.662
{\an5}Nice to meet you, Sade.

28:15.026 --> 28:17.662
{\an1}Good to meet you
in person.

28:17.729 --> 28:19.130
So I reached out to you

28:19.197 --> 28:20.498
{\an1}because I saw
your clothing line.

28:20.565 --> 28:22.000
{\an3}Right.

28:20.565 --> 28:22.000
Yes, and Miss Nikki,

28:22.067 --> 28:23.401
she loves your clothes.

28:23.468 --> 28:25.170
So, what is
y'all's relationship?

28:25.236 --> 28:26.304
Oh, that's my homegirl.

28:26.371 --> 28:27.472
{\an1}You know,
we have mutual...

28:27.539 --> 28:28.740
She thinks she's my manager.

28:28.807 --> 28:31.576
{\an8}You see what I'm saying?

28:31.643 --> 28:33.411
{\an4}And I'm just nosey.
You feel me?

28:31.643 --> 28:33.411
{\an3}Right.

28:33.478 --> 28:34.946
{\an1}So, talking of
being nosey,

28:35.013 --> 28:36.081
I was, like,
on your page

28:36.147 --> 28:38.083
{\an1}and I see that you're,
like, with someone

28:38.149 --> 28:39.818
that's dating my friend,

28:39.884 --> 28:41.019
Teairra Marí.

28:42.720 --> 28:44.989
Pause, um, are we here
on business,

28:45.056 --> 28:47.092
{\an1}or are y'all here to talk about
my personal relationship?

28:47.158 --> 28:49.727
{\an5}Well, it was like I...

28:47.158 --> 28:49.727
{\an1}I was kinda like--
it is still business.

28:49.794 --> 28:51.262
{\an1}But we just kinda
wanna see--

28:51.329 --> 28:52.797
{\an1}'cause we wanna tell you
what we knew, too.

28:52.864 --> 28:54.165
{\an6}Okay.

28:52.864 --> 28:54.165
{\an1}'Cause if this is
your man, too,

28:54.232 --> 28:56.134
{\an1}I think that,
woman to woman,

28:56.201 --> 28:57.769
{\an1}you would wanna know, too,
what we know.

28:57.836 --> 28:59.337
{\an1}Lately Teairra's
been dating

28:59.404 --> 29:01.039
{\an1}this guy who's
been on your page.

29:01.106 --> 29:02.941
{\an1}I just wanna know is the guy
that's on your page,

29:03.007 --> 29:04.843
{\an5}is that your husband?

29:03.007 --> 29:04.843
That is my husband.

29:04.909 --> 29:06.311
Are you guys really married,
or you just, like,

29:06.377 --> 29:07.846
{\an5}call yourself "wifey...?"

29:06.377 --> 29:07.846
No, we are really married.

29:07.912 --> 29:09.347
I don't play
those types of games.

29:09.414 --> 29:10.682
{\an4}Okay.

29:09.414 --> 29:10.682
If I'm dating somebody,
I'm dating somebody.

29:10.748 --> 29:11.883
{\an5}If that's my man...

29:10.748 --> 29:11.883
But when you come out here,

29:11.950 --> 29:13.418
{\an1}you stay in a hotel
or y'all stay together?

29:13.485 --> 29:15.053
No, we have a spot here,
we have a spot in Atlanta,

29:15.120 --> 29:16.688
{\an5}we have a spot in Dallas.

29:15.120 --> 29:16.688
So how the hell he be--

29:16.754 --> 29:18.857
{\an1}I'm just confused.
I'm not trying--

29:18.923 --> 29:20.558
{\an5}They're always together.

29:18.923 --> 29:20.558
'Cause they be together
at the house, too.

29:20.625 --> 29:22.327
{\an5}They're always together?

29:20.625 --> 29:22.327
Always together.

29:22.393 --> 29:23.828
Oh. They're always together?

29:23.895 --> 29:26.030
{\an1}If they're always together,
then why are we together?

29:26.097 --> 29:27.499
You know, clearly you're in
the picture.

29:27.565 --> 29:29.234
You know what I'm saying?

29:29.300 --> 29:32.137
{\an5}'Cause you know--

29:29.300 --> 29:32.137
Obviously they have
some type of arrangement.

29:32.203 --> 29:33.171
{\an6}I mean...

29:32.203 --> 29:33.171
{\an1}So you don't know about
the arrangement?

29:33.238 --> 29:34.272
What I'm saying is:

29:34.339 --> 29:36.307
Whatever he does,
that's his business.

29:36.374 --> 29:37.509
I don't have anything
to do with...

29:37.575 --> 29:38.676
Y'all have, like,
an open marriage?

29:38.743 --> 29:40.512
That's not what
I'm saying, Paris;

29:40.578 --> 29:43.281
{\an5}I don't know you
well enough
to even indulge...

29:43.348 --> 29:44.849
This woman
acts like she knows about

29:44.916 --> 29:46.384
Teairra and Akbar's
relationship.

29:46.451 --> 29:48.419
If that's what their
arrangement is, that's fine,

29:48.486 --> 29:50.388
but leave my friend
the hell out of this.

29:50.455 --> 29:52.423
If she has any questions,
she can come and ask me.

29:52.490 --> 29:54.492
{\an5}He's a womanizer.

29:52.490 --> 29:54.492
He-- He's not--

29:54.559 --> 29:55.827
{\an1}You don't think
he's a womanizer?

29:55.894 --> 29:56.728
Girl, don't disrespect
my husband like that.

29:56.794 --> 29:57.962
But he's dating my friend.

29:58.029 --> 29:59.531
But-- Okay,
but he's not a womanizer.

29:59.597 --> 30:00.832
{\an5}Don't say stuff
like that.

29:59.597 --> 30:00.832
What does that mean though?

30:00.899 --> 30:02.200
{\an5}Don't say stuff--

30:00.899 --> 30:02.200
But he's married to you

30:02.267 --> 30:03.301
and he's dating
my friend, so--

30:03.368 --> 30:04.769
{\an5}That is not a womanizer.

30:03.368 --> 30:04.769
So what is it?

30:04.836 --> 30:06.304
Y'all don't know
what she got going on.

30:06.371 --> 30:08.206
{\an5}Maybe she don't
wanna tell you.
I don't know!

30:08.273 --> 30:10.675
(crosstalk)

30:10.742 --> 30:12.644
{\an5}Are y'all in the band
with him?

30:10.742 --> 30:12.644
{\an1}I know for a fact
they (bleep).

30:12.710 --> 30:14.679
Are you in the back room
when they're having sex?

30:14.746 --> 30:16.014
Are you in the back--

30:16.080 --> 30:17.448
{\an1}How the (bleep) do you know
if they (bleep)?

30:17.515 --> 30:18.783
(crosstalk)

30:18.850 --> 30:20.018
{\an1}I know.

30:20.084 --> 30:21.419
Either this woman is in
an open marriage,

30:21.486 --> 30:22.654
or she's just in denial.

30:22.720 --> 30:24.522
But it seems like
she don't even care

30:24.589 --> 30:26.491
that her husband's
banging my friend.

30:26.558 --> 30:28.459
{\an5}There's more to this
than she's admitting

30:28.526 --> 30:29.727
and I can feel it.

30:29.794 --> 30:31.329
She wants to invest in
my company, or...?

30:31.396 --> 30:32.430
{\an4}No, she don't.
She don't.

30:31.396 --> 30:32.430
Okay, well then,

30:32.497 --> 30:33.998
what the (bleep)
am I still here for?

30:34.065 --> 30:36.134
{\an4}Exactly. I don't know why.
I don't know why.

30:34.065 --> 30:36.134
Bye, bye, bye.

30:36.201 --> 30:37.902
