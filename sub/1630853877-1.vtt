49:40.770 --> 49:43.083
And, it just so...
It happens that

49:43.187 --> 49:45.913
she has been hangin'
out with my brother

49:46.017 --> 49:48.986
and his friend,
[STAMMERING] Charlie.

49:49.676 --> 49:51.333
That's why I'm here.

49:51.436 --> 49:56.855
So what happened was
you [MIMICS STAMMERING]
came here to hang out

49:56.959 --> 49:59.858
with your girl who's also
hangin' out with your...

49:59.962 --> 50:00.825
Brother.

50:00.928 --> 50:03.103
Who then is
hanging out with...

50:03.207 --> 50:04.622
Charlie....Charlie,

50:04.725 --> 50:06.037
and his friends.

50:06.141 --> 50:08.212
You don't gotta
make fun of me,
but yes.

50:08.488 --> 50:09.765
Perfect.

50:11.353 --> 50:12.802
Just kids, huh?

50:19.050 --> 50:20.707
Irons! When were
you gonna tell me

50:20.810 --> 50:22.295
you found The Guard's
secret headquarters?

50:22.398 --> 50:24.642
I wanted to wait
till we actually had
the energy source.

50:24.745 --> 50:26.195
You were waiting.
So where is it?

50:26.299 --> 50:27.507
Missing.

50:27.610 --> 50:30.234
There's someone down here.
Could be security, militia...

50:30.337 --> 50:31.476
Militia?

50:31.580 --> 50:33.168
I mean, whoever it is,
they're highly evasive.

50:35.963 --> 50:38.449
Romeo and Juliet over here
are the teenage militia?

50:40.175 --> 50:41.417
Hi, guys.

50:41.521 --> 50:43.350
Defend ourselves?

50:43.454 --> 50:44.731
How do you expect us
to do that?

50:44.834 --> 50:46.077
I have an idea.

50:46.181 --> 50:47.906
Have you guys heard
of guerilla warfare?

50:48.010 --> 50:49.391
Xbox or PS5?

50:49.494 --> 50:51.565
No, actual
guerilla warfare.

50:51.669 --> 50:53.153
Using your weaknesses
as strengths?

50:53.257 --> 50:55.155
We're smaller than them,
but we're mobile.

50:55.259 --> 50:58.193
We have home field advantage
and a giant 3D printer.

50:58.296 --> 51:00.091
I say we get
the gadgets,

51:00.195 --> 51:02.680
get scrappy,
and fight our way out.

51:02.783 --> 51:04.095
ARGON:
Is this thing on? Yeah.

51:04.199 --> 51:06.408
Hi, I'm looking for
a Charlie Kincaid.

51:06.511 --> 51:08.444
I got someone here
who'd like to say hi to you.

51:08.548 --> 51:11.378
LIZZIE: Charlie, these
old guys have guns!
Do whatever they say.

They got Lizzie.

51:13.587 --> 51:16.797
BIG MAC: Berger, hey,
hey, man. Look, if I die,
I'm gonna kill you!

51:16.901 --> 51:17.936
ARGON: Dude, shut up.

51:18.040 --> 51:19.766
Give me the Source,
Charlie Kincaid,

51:19.869 --> 51:21.457
or I'll kill your friends.
You got it?

51:21.561 --> 51:22.631
BERGER: My brother's here.

51:22.734 --> 51:24.529
They're gonna kill
my brother. Give me that.

51:24.633 --> 51:26.842
Berger, I know you're
scared. I am, too.

51:26.945 --> 51:28.982
But we have a plan.
We can fight back.Shh.

51:29.086 --> 51:32.089
Come on, Charlie,
you're not exactly
the action hero type.

51:32.192 --> 51:34.125
What am I then,
since you seem to know?

51:34.229 --> 51:37.301
You're a scaredy-cat.
And you know what?
Scaredy-cat is good.

51:37.404 --> 51:39.406
Guys.But this is not the time
to play hero cat, okay?

51:39.510 --> 51:40.890
Stick to scaredy-cat.MAYA: Shh!

51:40.994 --> 51:43.583
This coming from
a guy who's scared
to leave the house

51:43.686 --> 51:44.894
without a backup inhaler?

51:44.998 --> 51:48.588
With all the asthma,
the celiacs,
the tubs of Flonase?

51:48.691 --> 51:50.003
Guys, come on.
You guys are friends.

51:50.107 --> 51:52.039
We're risking our lives
for that rock

51:52.143 --> 51:53.903
so you can prove
to your dad
how brave you are.

51:54.007 --> 51:55.595
But guess what?
He doesn't care.

51:55.698 --> 51:56.734
He cares more
about his job

51:56.837 --> 51:58.322
than he cares
about his own son.

52:00.427 --> 52:01.566

Hey, stop it. You idiots.

52:08.815 --> 52:10.610
This isn't the time for
airing of grievances!

52:10.713 --> 52:12.163
Now let's work together.

52:12.267 --> 52:15.960
No way. I'd rather go
Han Solo than be
teamed up with you.

52:27.730 --> 52:30.561
Busy. Just focus on
finding the Source.

52:31.838 --> 52:33.150
You heard him,

what's your status?

53:03.904 --> 53:05.285
Have you found anything?

53:05.389 --> 53:06.355
Damn.

53:07.943 --> 53:09.807
Nothin'. And the power
source isn't here.

53:10.463 --> 53:11.429
Find it, please.

I can't wait to blow
this place up.

This is it.
This is The Guard's

54:01.928 --> 54:05.172
You literally gave
a presentation
about this yesterday.

54:05.276 --> 54:07.520
Ms. Squint owes me
an apology.

54:07.623 --> 54:09.763
Do you think I could win
a Nobel Prize from this?

54:09.867 --> 54:11.386
I don't think so.BERGER: Hey!

54:12.352 --> 54:15.252
Who's the hero-cat now,

54:21.499 --> 54:23.398
Sorry about what
I said back there.

54:23.501 --> 54:25.262
Your ailments aren't
what make you weak,

54:25.365 --> 54:27.471
they're actually what
makes you strong.

54:27.574 --> 54:29.196
And I'm sorry
I punched you.[SIGHS]

54:29.300 --> 54:31.820
BERGER: That was
a really good apology.

54:31.923 --> 54:33.684
I wasn't ready
to forgive you.

54:33.787 --> 54:35.824
I planned on throwing
way more shade.

54:35.927 --> 54:38.033
But, I'm sorry, too.

And how do you plan
on torturin' me?

Are you gonna
tickle torture me?

gonna do?

55:14.138 --> 55:15.381
Dude, that was too long!

55:15.484 --> 55:17.072
Does that feel
like tickle torture?

55:17.175 --> 55:18.315
That thing's amazing.
Ya wanna sell it?

55:18.418 --> 55:19.833

55:23.941 --> 55:26.081
Okay, that thing?
That glowing thing?

55:26.184 --> 55:27.945
That thing's highly
advanced technology.

55:28.048 --> 55:30.327
It's like otherworldly
technology.

55:30.430 --> 55:33.191
"Otherworldly"
as in aliens?

55:35.262 --> 55:36.540
Yeah.

55:36.643 --> 55:39.646
That's what "otherworldly"
means, it's not
from this world.

55:39.750 --> 55:42.235
No way. That thing
is clearly designed
for humans.

55:42.339 --> 55:44.237
No, that's because
it adapts
to its environment.

55:44.341 --> 55:46.377
It's a world builder.
It created
this entire place!

55:46.481 --> 55:49.415
I mean, do you think
The Guard built this?
Not without that.

55:49.518 --> 55:50.623
Why do you want it?

55:50.726 --> 55:53.936
Because I think that
The Guard has only unlocked

55:54.040 --> 55:56.283
a fraction
of its potential.

55:56.387 --> 55:57.768
And you wanna
make weapons out of it.

55:57.871 --> 55:59.045
Ya know what
I want it for?

55:59.148 --> 56:02.048
I wanna use it
so I can solve
the world's problems.

56:02.151 --> 56:03.670
So why not tell that
to my dad, huh?

You know how many times
I've been on TV
asking for his help?

56:07.294 --> 56:09.952
And you know what?
I got ghosted.

56:10.056 --> 56:11.644
I'm familiar
with the feeling.

56:11.747 --> 56:14.474
And your dad's being, like,
so selfish right now.

56:14.578 --> 56:16.959

that technology
all to himself!

be close to him,

let him in, okay?
