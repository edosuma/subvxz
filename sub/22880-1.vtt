there's this attraction

03:14.278 --> 03:16.614
Because that's the source

03:18.240 --> 03:19.450
[faint audience chuckling]

03:19.450 --> 03:20.743
Wow, all right.

03:20.743 --> 03:22.369
I'm the last guy.

03:22.369 --> 03:24.496
I do stand up comedy,
I've never smoked weed.

03:24.496 --> 03:27.083
And when you tell comics that,
you blow their minds.

03:27.083 --> 03:29.127
I basically get a couple
of responses.

03:29.127 --> 03:31.837
Either they'll be like
"Dude, just try it, man.

03:31.837 --> 03:33.047
It's gonna open up your mind,

03:33.047 --> 03:34.423
you're gonna be
so much funnier,

03:34.423 --> 03:36.258
like next level stuff, bro."

03:36.258 --> 03:39.053
Or they'll be like, "Dude,
stay away from that stuff."

03:39.053 --> 03:40.805
You don't need it,
it's gonna ruin your life."

03:40.805 --> 03:42.681
And what's scary is
it's the same guy

03:42.681 --> 03:43.808
telling me both those things.

03:43.808 --> 03:45.267
[audience laughing]

03:45.267 --> 03:47.519
I was a kid in the 70s,
when it was outlawed.

03:47.519 --> 03:49.147
It was the devil's weed.

03:49.147 --> 03:51.482
[rock music]

03:55.194 --> 03:56.570
It was good for you.

03:56.570 --> 03:58.697
So therefore,
I always felt it was legal.

03:58.697 --> 04:01.408
[rock music]

04:01.408 --> 04:03.368
I was really tired of
going to shops

04:03.368 --> 04:05.079
and seeing a lot of crappy meds.

04:05.079 --> 04:07.165
So I thought, "Fuck it,
I'll grow my own."

04:07.165 --> 04:09.333
[rock music]

04:10.584 --> 04:12.711
People are purchasing
legal marijuana

04:12.711 --> 04:14.421

they're getting

04:29.061 --> 04:31.063
I don't think cannabis
is a problem,

04:31.063 --> 04:32.898
I think the ignorance
is the problem.

04:32.898 --> 04:34.733
[rock music]

04:34.733 --> 04:38.154
The war on drugs has
been a war on young people;

04:38.154 --> 04:40.698
people of addiction issues,
people of color,

04:40.698 --> 04:44.326
and people from the lowest
socioeconomic backgrounds.

04:44.326 --> 04:46.162
[rock music]

04:47.454 --> 04:50.916
There's been voluminous
studies on the topic

04:50.916 --> 04:52.292
that have completely debunked

04:52.292 --> 04:54.336
that marijuana
is a gateway drug.

04:55.754 --> 04:58.216
There's a lot of money
in this and now business,

04:58.216 --> 04:59.550

come in and say,

"You all gonna take
this shit over."

05:01.052 --> 05:03.137
[rock music]

05:03.137 --> 05:05.681
The mindset that I was
brought up with was yes,

05:05.681 --> 05:08.017
that marijuana
and cocaine and acid,

05:08.017 --> 05:11.729
all those hippie drugs,
that they're all the same.

05:11.729 --> 05:14.648
[subdued musical tone]

05:16.817 --> 05:19.695
The time is long overdue

05:19.695 --> 05:24.533
for us to remove the Federal
prohibition on marijuana.

05:24.533 --> 05:29.413
We have got to stop imprisoning
people who use marijuana. The

05:29.413 --> 05:33.292
marijuana thing is
such a big, such a big thing.

05:33.292 --> 05:35.669
I really believe you should
leave it up to the states.

05:35.669 --> 05:37.046
I like where it is now.

05:37.046 --> 05:39.006
If the state wants
to try it, they can. I

05:39.006 --> 05:41.842
think California's gonna
vote to legalize it in November

05:41.842 --> 05:44.011
and I think that's really
gonna be the tipping point.

05:44.011 --> 05:45.554

06:26.553 --> 06:29.265
You as a private citizen

ever know of in any top level

at this stage,

it's the only reason
that I'm still alive.

in Detroit, Michigan,

09:36.701 --> 09:39.497

in the city alone.

09:42.249 --> 09:45.127

and I lost my job.

09:45.127 --> 09:47.087
It was like, cannabis was there.

09:47.087 --> 09:50.424
And I took my severance pay and
I built a grow room in Michigan.

09:50.424 --> 09:52.801
And since then I've been
in the caregiver network,

09:52.801 --> 09:55.554
in the medical marijuana
industry of Michigan.

Marijuana does 400
different things.

Helps with 400
different maladies.

10:01.768 --> 10:03.603
When you take
all of that into account,

10:03.603 --> 10:05.730
why would you deny
a medical use?

the other big pharma companies

10:08.900 --> 10:12.279

for us at very high cost,

10:12.279 --> 10:14.781

in cannabis, cannabidiol,

benefit in children

known as Dravet syndrome.

form of epilepsy.

hundreds every single day.

11:04.039 --> 11:06.250

and physical decline,

11:06.250 --> 11:09.002
similar to Alzheimer's
or Parkinson's Disease.

11:10.837 --> 11:15.259
Any legally prescribed
pharmaceutical for epilepsy,

11:15.259 --> 11:18.345
our son has tried.

11:18.345 --> 11:21.932
He would have significant weight
gain or weight loss, rage,

11:21.932 --> 11:23.808
anger, sadness,

11:23.808 --> 11:25.810
and none of them
stopped the seizures.

11:25.810 --> 11:29.565
None of them,
over fourteen years.

11:29.565 --> 11:31.525
When I returned to the
University of Oklahoma

11:31.525 --> 11:35.571
to do some studies on neurology
and our son's condition,

11:35.571 --> 11:40.951
I stumbled across the U.S.
Patent number 6630507,

11:40.951 --> 11:43.787
which in that particular patent,
it proves that cannabinoids

11:43.787 --> 11:45.956
are neuroprotectants.

11:45.956 --> 11:48.917
There was 40 years
of post-World War II,

11:48.917 --> 11:51.920
modern era's research
that supported not only

11:51.920 --> 11:53.380
the plant as medicinal,

11:53.380 --> 11:56.634
but as non-toxic and non-lethal.

11:56.634 --> 11:59.470
We knew that cannabis was
never gonna be an option

11:59.470 --> 12:00.887
with Austin in Oklahoma.

12:00.887 --> 12:02.722
The doctors said,
"That there was nothing more

12:02.722 --> 12:04.224
that they could do for our son."

12:04.224 --> 12:06.602
The pharmaceuticals were
shutting down his organs,

12:06.602 --> 12:08.270
and basically to take him home.

12:08.270 --> 12:11.398
So in a way we did,
we took him to Colorado.

12:12.065 --> 12:13.817
[pensive music]

12:17.237 --> 12:21.158
When you watch your son dying

12:21.158 --> 12:25.120
and the doctors tell you there's
nothing else that they can do,

12:26.622 --> 12:31.001
and then this little
plant stops his seizures,

12:34.338 --> 12:37.215
it's like we could live again.

12:37.215 --> 12:38.800
We had hope again.

12:38.800 --> 12:42.095
We knew...

12:42.095 --> 12:44.764
We knew that we were gonna
have Austin a little longer.

12:48.977 --> 12:50.646
[pensive music]

12:53.106 --> 12:54.566
Now that he's on cannabis,

12:54.566 --> 12:56.276
I mean he tells us
that he loves us.

12:56.276 --> 13:00.947
He will come over and just
hug us to give us a kiss.

13:09.873 --> 13:11.375
He can play
with his little brothers.

13:11.375 --> 13:13.752
He can comprehend
and understand things.

13:13.752 --> 13:15.337
He's happy now.

13:15.337 --> 13:17.964
You know, we used to think
that cannabis was bad too.

13:17.964 --> 13:20.342
I used to think
it was the devil's lettuce

13:20.342 --> 13:23.178
and that it caused people
to do crazy things.

13:23.178 --> 13:26.806
Now I've learned it's not.
That's not the case at all.

13:26.806 --> 13:30.977
Moving to Colorado saved our
son's life, it saved our life.

13:35.315 --> 13:38.360
If you're telling me that
a family has to leave a state

13:38.360 --> 13:41.821
to get something to make their
kid feel a little better,

13:41.821 --> 13:43.615
are you kidding me?

13:43.615 --> 13:45.116
People have to leave their state

13:45.116 --> 13:46.702
to alleviate their
children's pain?

13:46.702 --> 13:49.204
That is outrageous
and worth, you know,

13:49.204 --> 13:52.040

of injustice.

13:52.040 --> 13:55.544
In 2004, I was diagnosed
with breast cancer.

13:55.544 --> 13:58.296
I quickly saw what the

13:58.296 --> 14:00.048
chemotherapy was
going to do to me,

14:00.048 --> 14:02.259
and I understood
that these cures,

14:02.259 --> 14:04.052
these medicines
that they were giving us

14:04.052 --> 14:07.472
were terribly destructive
to the body.

14:07.472 --> 14:11.059
I couldn't imagine someone
going through chemotherapy

14:11.059 --> 14:14.688
without this for appetite,
for depression,

14:14.688 --> 14:16.314
for pain, for sleep.

14:16.314 --> 14:19.150
And after I'd gone
through that experience,

14:19.150 --> 14:22.987
I realized that I felt very
passionate about cannabis

14:22.987 --> 14:25.490
and I really wanted people
to know that it was a big part

14:25.490 --> 14:26.950
of my recovery.

14:26.950 --> 14:30.287
Instead of writing
prescriptions for

14:30.287 --> 14:31.871
five or six different medicines,

14:31.871 --> 14:34.207
I can recommend that
they try one medicine,

23:21.776 --> 23:25.863
by the American government
on the American people.

23:25.863 --> 23:27.490
Pelican Bay is one of
the most secure prisons

23:27.490 --> 23:29.117
in the entire country.

23:29.117 --> 23:31.202
It's where we put the worst
of the worst of the worst.

23:31.202 --> 23:34.705
That prison has an opiate
overdose rate several times

23:34.705 --> 23:36.624
that of what exists
on the street.

23:36.624 --> 23:38.960
If you can't keep drugs
out of Pelican Bay,

23:38.960 --> 23:41.629
you can't keep drugs out
of your local high school.

23:41.629 --> 23:44.507
[Paul] We would rather
demonize drugs,

23:44.507 --> 23:48.386
we would rather
make drugs mysterious,

23:48.386 --> 23:51.931
we would rather give these
moral qualities to drugs,

23:51.931 --> 23:54.475
than simply recognize the fact

23:54.475 --> 23:56.936
that these are
chemical compounds

23:56.936 --> 24:00.357
that have psychotropic
effects on the human body.

24:00.357 --> 24:02.566
You know we've taken this
out of the back alleys.

24:02.566 --> 24:04.194
We've taken it
out of the shadows.

24:04.194 --> 24:06.321
We've created an environment
where people can go

24:06.321 --> 24:08.447
just like you go to
a liquor store

24:08.447 --> 24:10.658
and can get something
that's regulated.

24:10.658 --> 24:12.535
You know what
you're putting in your body,

24:12.535 --> 24:15.163
so we've taken money out of
the pockets of our cartels.

24:15.163 --> 24:17.957
We've actually seen
some decline in crime.

24:17.957 --> 24:20.626
We haven't seen teen
use of marijuana go up.

24:20.626 --> 24:24.755
We've taken in about 135 million
dollars in in-state taxes.

24:24.755 --> 24:26.924
They're gonna legalize pot

24:26.924 --> 24:29.344
so they can mend
the fucking potholes.

24:29.344 --> 24:31.304
[tires squealing]

24:31.304 --> 24:32.680
Am I wrong?

24:32.680 --> 24:34.307
Am I wrong?

24:34.307 --> 24:36.976
You, you legislators,
am I wrong?

24:37.935 --> 24:40.397
Are you gonna take the money?

24:40.397 --> 24:43.691
Well if you don't it'd be a
remarkable change in politics,

24:43.691 --> 24:44.734
wouldn't it?

24:44.734 --> 24:46.819
[rock music]

25:06.797 --> 25:10.134
So if we can write the
rules and create an industry

25:10.134 --> 25:14.222
and create a culture that
is good for working people,

25:14.222 --> 25:15.932
that's good for the environment,

25:15.932 --> 25:18.059
that's a huge opportunity,
and it's something

25:18.059 --> 25:20.686
that is developing right
along with legalization.

25:22.105 --> 25:26.776
NORML did a
congressional scorecard

25:26.776 --> 25:30.988
where we graded every
member of congress

25:30.988 --> 25:32.656
based on their statements

25:32.656 --> 25:36.453
and their voting record with
regard to marijuana policy.

25:36.453 --> 25:40.581
Five percent of the members
of congress were graded an A,

25:40.581 --> 25:44.210
which meant that they
had backed publicly

25:44.210 --> 25:46.212
the legalization of marijuana.

25:46.212 --> 25:50.258
That's a public policy that
is now supported by 60%

25:50.258 --> 25:51.717
of America,

25:51.717 --> 25:54.512
but only 5% of lawmakers

25:54.512 --> 25:56.973
in congress embrace that policy.

25:56.973 --> 26:00.351
We did a governor's scorecard,
all 50 governors,

26:00.351 --> 26:03.146
we found exactly
the same results.

26:03.146 --> 26:05.689
Only two governors out of 50

26:05.689 --> 26:10.445
were on record supporting
the regulation of marijuana.

26:10.445 --> 26:12.238
Again,

26:12.238 --> 26:14.449
at the political level,

26:14.449 --> 26:18.869
we simply don't see the support
we see among the public.

26:18.869 --> 26:22.748
The democrats and the
republicans all have to take

26:22.748 --> 26:24.625
a certain amount
of responsibility

26:24.625 --> 26:26.127
for these racist laws.

26:26.127 --> 26:28.254
So in terms of this
administration,

26:28.254 --> 26:29.880
it defies common sense.

26:29.880 --> 26:33.176
Conservatives tend to uphold
the ideal of states rights,

26:33.176 --> 26:36.971
so I'm hoping that Donald
Trump adheres to that,

26:36.971 --> 26:38.515
but I have no fucking idea.

26:38.515 --> 26:40.308
This drug is dangerous.

26:40.308 --> 26:41.725
You cannot play with it.

26:41.725 --> 26:42.893
It's not funny.

26:42.893 --> 26:44.354
It's not something
to laugh about.

26:44.354 --> 26:47.315
And trying to send that
message with clarity,

26:47.315 --> 26:49.984
that good people
don't smoke marijuana.

26:49.984 --> 26:52.362
"Good people don't
smoke Marijuana"

26:52.362 --> 26:53.821
[audience laughing]

26:53.821 --> 26:55.698
In that voice that sounds
like it was spawned

26:55.698 --> 26:58.117
from like twelve
generations of moonshiners.

26:58.117 --> 26:59.785
[audience laughing]

26:59.785 --> 27:01.871
Like Keebler
just opened a still.

27:01.871 --> 27:03.998
[audience laughing]

27:05.249 --> 27:07.043
That breaks my heart
that I won't be invited

27:07.043 --> 27:09.628
to Jeff Sessions'
good people party.

27:11.464 --> 27:13.174
I hear it's very formal,

27:13.799 --> 27:14.967
white hood only.

27:14.967 --> 27:17.011
[audience laughing]

27:17.011 --> 27:19.347
And if we go back
into this path,

27:19.347 --> 27:20.890
we're going to regret it.

27:20.890 --> 27:23.393
On a Federal level,
because it's still Schedule 1,

27:23.393 --> 27:26.229
this despot is gonna stand
up there and he's gonna say,

27:26.229 --> 27:30.858
"Look, this is what the law is,
and I'm gonna go after you.

27:30.858 --> 27:34.445
Even though in your
state you've all agreed

27:34.445 --> 27:35.738
that this is what you wanna do."

27:35.738 --> 27:37.698
How mad can
the reefer madness get?

27:37.698 --> 27:40.243
You've got a president that's
worried about terrorism

27:40.243 --> 27:41.744
and he wants to
spend money and time

27:41.744 --> 27:44.747
going after
law abiding cannabis users.

27:44.747 --> 27:46.957
But we have some
bad hombres here

27:46.957 --> 27:48.418
and we're gonna get 'em out.

27:48.418 --> 27:50.002
Could troops be
coming in here?

27:50.002 --> 27:52.213
Could the National Guard
be deployed?

27:52.213 --> 27:54.632
If they wanna come in
and pull the rug out

27:54.632 --> 27:56.217
from under the state of Colorado

27:56.217 --> 27:59.637
when we're doing successfully
economically, socially,

27:59.637 --> 28:02.014
and even providing new resources

28:02.014 --> 28:04.058
for people struggling
with drug addiction.

28:04.058 --> 28:05.851
If they wanna pull that
rug out from under us,

28:05.851 --> 28:06.936
I'm ready for a fight.

28:06.936 --> 28:08.229
[screaming and yelling]

28:08.229 --> 28:09.688
[Fight Announcer]
And look at this! Trump!

28:09.688 --> 28:10.773
Donald Trump!

28:10.773 --> 28:13.109
Donald Trump, oh my God!

28:13.109 --> 28:15.861
The hostile takeover of
Donald Trump.

28:15.861 --> 28:19.449
I'm okay with legalization
as long as a few things happen.

28:19.449 --> 28:22.410
Number one, you get that person
off of our healthcare system.

28:22.410 --> 28:24.537
Number two, you take away
their driver's license.

28:24.537 --> 28:27.582
Number three, you take away
their kids and you isolate them.

28:27.582 --> 28:29.750
If they sell or smoke weed,

28:29.750 --> 28:31.710
they should take away
their healthcare,

28:31.710 --> 28:33.504
they should take away
their children,

28:33.504 --> 28:35.798
and they should take away
their fucking citizenship.

28:35.798 --> 28:37.925
Like, dude,
that's not a weed smoker.

28:37.925 --> 28:40.177
That's a Mexican.
That's what that is.

28:40.177 --> 28:43.847
I was arrested seven
times for having weed.

28:43.847 --> 28:45.349
A small amount for a blunt.

28:45.349 --> 28:47.893
If your skin happens
to be a little darker,

28:47.893 --> 28:52.315
you have a 50% to 75%
more of a chance

28:52.315 --> 28:54.733
of going to jail
for the same crime.

28:54.733 --> 28:56.735
How do we solve the
problem of getting minorities

28:56.735 --> 28:59.697
into the legal market and
getting them to be able

28:59.697 --> 29:02.283
to participate just as
much as, as anyone else?

29:02.283 --> 29:05.077
People with less means,
whether that's economic

29:05.077 --> 29:08.456
or educational, a person
of color, or a woman,

29:08.456 --> 29:11.917
there's these barriers to
entry into the legal market

29:11.917 --> 29:14.920
that in some ways have been
set up just by the regulations

29:14.920 --> 29:17.423
that we put forward
as lawmakers.

29:17.423 --> 29:19.342
In many states,
you're not allowed

29:19.342 --> 29:21.594
to work in the industry
if you have a conviction.

29:21.594 --> 29:23.304
And those that are convicted,

29:23.304 --> 29:26.182
especially on marijuana crimes,
these are our experts.

29:26.182 --> 29:28.892
So it's kind of ironic
that the very people

29:28.892 --> 29:31.770
that got us started are
now being excommunicated

29:31.770 --> 29:34.148
from participating
in a legal market.

29:34.148 --> 29:35.941
And it's not fair because
it's the people of color

29:35.941 --> 29:37.735
that went to prison
for this plant.

29:37.735 --> 29:40.613
Now, you have, you know,
all the suits making billions

29:40.613 --> 29:43.366
of dollars, and they're
trying to cut everybody out.

29:43.366 --> 29:44.992
That's not okay.

29:46.744 --> 29:49.622
[Tommy] They came to my
house at five in the morning

29:49.622 --> 29:54.711
with a SWAT team fully
armed with riot gear,

29:54.711 --> 29:56.170
and masks,

29:56.170 --> 30:00.341
and helmets
and automatic weapons.

30:00.341 --> 30:03.761
[Nick] These guys are looking
like they're in downtown Mosul,

30:03.761 --> 30:05.596
a special forces team
type of deal,

30:05.596 --> 30:07.431
and they're just
decked out head to toe.

30:07.431 --> 30:09.933
That militarization
of our police force

30:09.933 --> 30:11.435
has gotten a little bit
out of control.

30:11.435 --> 30:13.396
[loud sawing]

30:16.399 --> 30:18.108
It's SWAT style raids.

30:18.108 --> 30:20.861
And I have clients that have
PTSD as a result of these raids.

30:20.861 --> 30:22.530
My name is Gary Levine.

30:22.530 --> 30:26.325
For the past 35 years,
I've been preparing kids

30:26.325 --> 30:27.993
and adults for the tests

30:27.993 --> 30:30.871
to get them into the next
phase of their education.

30:30.871 --> 30:33.374
Over the years, I've helped
people get into college

30:33.374 --> 30:35.292
and grad school
and medical school,

30:35.292 --> 30:37.545
that they probably wouldn't
have been able to do

30:37.545 --> 30:39.880
were it not for our
work together.

30:43.175 --> 30:45.010
About 14 years ago,

30:45.010 --> 30:48.431
I bought this property
that had an avocado farm on it.

30:48.431 --> 30:52.184
About six years ago, they did
away with agricultural water

30:52.184 --> 30:55.772
for my district
and my monthly water bill

30:55.772 --> 30:58.232
went from about
a thousand dollars a month

30:58.232 --> 31:00.234
to about three thousand
dollars a month.

31:00.234 --> 31:02.570
So I told everybody
that we're gonna get out

31:02.570 --> 31:04.363
of the avocado business.

31:07.032 --> 31:10.911
One day, a guy knocks
on my door and he said,

31:10.911 --> 31:12.913
"We're a group of
disabled veterans,

31:12.913 --> 31:16.125
and we would like to
rent that space to grow."

31:16.125 --> 31:19.086
When I started doing it,
I had visions that, you know,

31:19.086 --> 31:21.672
I was gonna make some money,
and isn't it gonna be ironic

31:21.672 --> 31:24.341
that Gary is making money
in the pot business.

31:24.341 --> 31:27.886
When Gary is the guy
who's never smoked pot.

31:27.886 --> 31:31.432
The second day of trimming,
the police raided us.

31:32.224 --> 31:33.892
And it was the police.

31:33.892 --> 31:35.185
It was the sheriffs department.

31:35.185 --> 31:36.646
It was the DEA.

31:36.646 --> 31:38.731
There were some
Federal agencies.

31:38.731 --> 31:41.358
There were probably
40 or 50 police.

31:41.358 --> 31:44.695
With at least one helicopter
overhead the whole time.

31:44.695 --> 31:47.740
All had their guns pointed
at different people.

31:47.740 --> 31:50.075
They threatened us with prison.

31:50.075 --> 31:53.036
They took me to jail.

31:53.036 --> 31:56.999
They enjoy intimidating
and hurting people.

31:56.999 --> 31:59.084
They sent me to strip naked

31:59.084 --> 32:01.003
and to put on their
jail clothes,

32:01.003 --> 32:03.714
all the while knowing that
my bail had been posted.

32:03.714 --> 32:06.509
They were trying to make
an example out of us

32:06.509 --> 32:10.346
and anybody else
who might grow weed.

32:10.346 --> 32:14.684
Because I used the word sell
instead of the word donate,

32:14.684 --> 32:17.645
they came down
really hard on me.

32:17.645 --> 32:21.064
[Michael] You see people that
have given their, their body

32:21.064 --> 32:24.485
and their soul
to fighting for our country

32:24.485 --> 32:26.320
and to fighting for our
way of life,

32:26.320 --> 32:29.114
and they come back and in
many cases they're ignored

32:29.114 --> 32:32.576
and there aren't a lot of
treatments out there for PTSD.

32:32.576 --> 32:34.745
And we're starting to see
that marijuana

32:34.745 --> 32:36.706
is one of the most
effective treatments.

32:36.706 --> 32:39.416
In many cases these people
end up being arrested

32:39.416 --> 32:42.085
and prosecuted for
cultivating for themselves

32:42.085 --> 32:43.880
or providing it to other vets.

32:43.880 --> 32:45.964
And it is an
emotional experience.

32:45.964 --> 32:49.301
It's very difficult to see
these people prosecuted.

32:49.301 --> 32:51.846
I would like to share my story

32:51.846 --> 32:53.890
about me facing five years

32:53.890 --> 32:56.600
in prison
for six cannabis plants.

32:56.600 --> 32:58.477
I'm a veteran of the
United States Marine Corp.

32:58.477 --> 33:00.813
I served for ten years.
I did three tours.

33:00.813 --> 33:03.399
They were treating conditions
associated with PTSD,

33:03.399 --> 33:06.944
so it was meds for anxiety,
depression, paranoia,

33:06.944 --> 33:11.198
as well as a large amount
of opiate-based meds

33:11.198 --> 33:15.202
to include Vicodin and
actually pure OxyContin.

33:15.202 --> 33:19.665
Roughly a year ago,
I was on over 13 pills a day,

33:19.665 --> 33:23.001
and as of March of 2016,

33:23.001 --> 33:24.670
I am pharmaceutical free,

33:24.670 --> 33:26.630
living only
a cannabis lifestyle.

33:26.630 --> 33:29.675
Within a day,
I'm actually playing

33:29.675 --> 33:31.761
with my newborn son at the time.

33:31.761 --> 33:33.011
So it was a dramatic difference.

33:33.011 --> 33:36.599
Cannabis has literally
changed my life.

33:36.599 --> 33:39.351
My kids understand why daddy
needs the medicine he does,

33:39.351 --> 33:42.229
and they truly love me
on cannabis.

33:42.229 --> 33:43.898
I'm a happier dad.

33:43.898 --> 33:46.233
I'm a better person to be
around. I live a better life.

33:46.233 --> 33:49.653
This is not just for me,
it is for veterans everywhere.

33:51.822 --> 33:53.532
[helicopter thrumming]

33:53.532 --> 33:55.868
[Reporter] <i> The drug trafficking</i>
<i>business has always been one</i>

33:55.868 --> 33:57.536
<i>that generates a ton of cash.</i>

33:57.536 --> 33:59.830
The attorney general's office
says that it's estimated

33:59.830 --> 34:02.332
that drug trafficking
profits in the U.S.

34:02.332 --> 34:05.711
are about 65 billion
dollars a year.

34:05.711 --> 34:07.504
[man] As soon as
you made it illegal,

34:07.504 --> 34:09.799
the price of it shot
up on the black market.

34:09.799 --> 34:12.342
Now, when the price shoots
up on the black market,

34:12.342 --> 34:17.306
what happens is it's basic
economic supply and demand.

34:17.306 --> 34:18.849
I am Mr. Purple.

34:18.849 --> 34:22.603
I distribute cannabis
products through the darknet.

34:22.603 --> 34:25.731
People go on there,
they make a selection.

34:25.731 --> 34:28.484
The buyer's money,
which is in bitcoin,

34:28.484 --> 34:31.821
goes into an escrow
in the darknet market

34:31.821 --> 34:36.659
until we send the package
and is received by the buyer.

34:36.659 --> 34:41.371
The protocol usually consists
of gloves, no fingerprints,

34:41.371 --> 34:43.581
no handwriting, no hair.

34:43.581 --> 34:48.587
There is no smell coming
from the package in any way.

34:48.587 --> 34:50.589
That's one of the primary ways

34:50.589 --> 34:54.969
that packages are confiscated
is by poor packing.

34:54.969 --> 34:57.680
From there, you then do
a little bit of extra security

34:57.680 --> 35:00.850
by putting anything that
you ship into Mylar.

35:00.850 --> 35:05.729
The Mylar is
completely un-X-rayable

35:05.729 --> 35:07.940
and it's impermeable to scent.

35:07.940 --> 35:10.359
A lot of it goes
to the east coast.

35:11.485 --> 35:13.529
Very seldomly does it head west.

35:13.529 --> 35:17.700
It's not as gangster
as people think it is.

35:17.700 --> 35:21.912
[man in green shirt] It is
the sellers in the black market

35:21.912 --> 35:26.166
that want cannabis
to be illegal,

35:26.166 --> 35:27.960
'cause that keeps the price high

35:27.960 --> 35:30.087
and it keeps
their profits rolling.

35:30.087 --> 35:32.422
If you look at
statistics on the number

35:32.422 --> 35:34.341
of marijuana seizures
that are happening

35:34.341 --> 35:35.843
at the border right now,

35:35.843 --> 35:38.595
they are down significantly
from previous years.

35:38.595 --> 35:42.182
They don't need to buy
the black market marijuana

35:42.182 --> 35:45.061
that in many cases has
chemicals, pesticides,

35:45.061 --> 35:46.687
they don't know what
they're getting,

35:46.687 --> 35:49.523
and that money is going
to fuel organized crime.

35:51.400 --> 35:54.236
[mysterious tones]

36:05.205 --> 36:07.124
[birds chirping]

36:14.090 --> 36:16.008
[engines whirring]

36:19.636 --> 36:22.305
We're told we don't know
enough about cannabis.

36:22.305 --> 36:24.808
We're told it hasn't
been adequately studied.

36:24.808 --> 36:26.560
Again,

36:26.560 --> 36:28.812
the reality is,

36:28.812 --> 36:31.314
is that we have ample evidence

36:31.314 --> 36:33.025
with regard to cannabis.

36:33.025 --> 36:36.570
We have more than 25,000
peer-reviewed studies

36:36.570 --> 36:38.572
in the scientific literature

36:38.572 --> 36:41.700
that reference
the marijuana plant.

36:41.700 --> 36:45.245
That's more than the
total volume of literature

36:45.245 --> 36:47.205
we have for Tylenol,

36:47.205 --> 36:49.458
or for ibuprofen.

36:50.500 --> 36:52.086
When it comes to cannabis,

36:52.086 --> 36:54.671
there is so much
for people to learn.

36:54.671 --> 36:57.174
[rock music]

37:03.513 --> 37:05.307
What is Oaksterdam University?

37:05.307 --> 37:06.934
For those that might not know,

37:06.934 --> 37:09.061
it's America's first
cannabis college.

37:19.155 --> 37:21.448
I focus on curriculum
and making sure

37:21.448 --> 37:24.660
that what we offer
the students matches

37:24.660 --> 37:27.370
what they'll need once
they get out on their own.

37:32.375 --> 37:34.044
And just removing the leaf.

37:34.044 --> 37:35.337
And we wanna remove the leaf,

37:35.337 --> 37:37.047
remember,
this is called the petiole,

37:37.047 --> 37:38.632
that's the stem of the leaf.

37:38.632 --> 37:40.759
We wanna remove the leaf
at the base of the petiole.

37:40.759 --> 37:43.261
[rock music]

37:56.066 --> 37:59.277
They're learning everything
from starting with seeds

37:59.277 --> 38:02.031
and seed germination
to transplanting,

38:02.031 --> 38:03.991
to what's called
vegetative growth,

38:03.991 --> 38:05.408
all the way through
the reproductive

38:05.408 --> 38:07.161
and flowering stages
of the plant.

38:07.161 --> 38:10.164
Through to harvest,
and how to design

38:10.164 --> 38:13.375
their own grow room from scratch
and fill it with lighting

38:13.375 --> 38:15.002
and all kinds
f ventilation equipment.

38:16.545 --> 38:19.631
You're gonna sit in
probably the most diverse

38:19.631 --> 38:22.092
classroom setting you're ever
gonna be in your life.

38:22.092 --> 38:23.844
You're gonna have high
school graduates sitting next

38:23.844 --> 38:26.763
to neurosurgeons next to
grandmothers sitting next

38:26.763 --> 38:29.266
to policymakers
and city council members.

38:29.266 --> 38:30.976
We have nine
academic departments,

38:30.976 --> 38:33.436
of which our legal
department is our largest.

38:33.436 --> 38:35.647
Before we teach you anything,
we teach you the law,

38:35.647 --> 38:37.774
so you understand what
you shouldn't be doing,

38:37.774 --> 38:40.027
and how to operate safely
and responsibly.

38:41.653 --> 38:43.697
In this industry, when you talk
to somebody about cannabis,

38:43.697 --> 38:45.991
99% of the time, you know
what they're giving you?

38:45.991 --> 38:47.743
Their opinion.

38:47.743 --> 38:49.786
And there's a difference between
being opinionated vs. educated.

38:49.786 --> 38:51.914
And that's why we have
Oaksterdam University.

38:51.914 --> 38:55.834
We graduated over 30,000
students from over 30 countries.

38:57.294 --> 38:59.088
When you graduate
from Oaksterdam,

38:59.088 --> 39:00.380
it's just the beginning.

39:00.380 --> 39:02.299
[rock music]

39:04.260 --> 39:06.595
They should be teaching
this to kids.

39:06.595 --> 39:09.098
You know, fuck that avocado
with the toothpicks in the jar,

39:09.098 --> 39:10.266
get that out of here!

39:10.266 --> 39:11.808
[audience laughing]

39:11.808 --> 39:14.270
Let's get Timmy and Scotty
to cutting some clones.

39:14.270 --> 39:15.562
[audience laughing]

39:15.562 --> 39:19.191
Yeah? We're gonna
crack seeds today, kids!

39:20.358 --> 39:22.278
"Hey, what are
you working with Kyle?"

39:22.278 --> 39:25.239
"Oh, I, I, I have a hybrid."

39:25.239 --> 39:27.616
"Really, did you cross-breed?"

39:27.616 --> 39:29.159
"Yes."

39:29.159 --> 39:31.954
My senior year in high
school I was in honors English.

39:31.954 --> 39:33.705
My teacher hated me.

39:33.705 --> 39:36.541
She just did not like me at all.

39:36.541 --> 39:39.002
And just to piss her off
I wrote a paper

39:39.002 --> 39:40.879
on the legalization
of marijuana.

39:40.879 --> 39:42.256
The paper was well written

39:42.256 --> 39:44.382
so she had to give me
a high grade [laughing],

39:44.382 --> 39:45.801
High grade.

39:48.053 --> 39:50.097
[Michael] Kids are
learning in high school

39:50.097 --> 39:54.184
that marijuana's just as
bad as heroin, cocaine, LSD,

39:54.184 --> 39:57.020
and as a result,
when they try it

39:57.020 --> 39:58.647
and realize it's not that bad,

39:58.647 --> 40:00.232
then maybe they think,
"You know what?

40:00.232 --> 40:02.318
Maybe heroin, LSD, and cocaine,

40:02.318 --> 40:04.194
maybe they're lying
to me about that as well."

40:04.194 --> 40:05.821
Marijuana is a gateway drug.

40:05.821 --> 40:08.698
That's the number one drug
people say they started with

40:08.698 --> 40:11.034
before they got onto
harder drugs.

40:11.034 --> 40:13.829
The notion that
it's a gateway to heroin

40:13.829 --> 40:17.499
is like saying sugar is a
gateway to, you know, suicide.

40:17.499 --> 40:21.795
[Laughing] I mean, it's
such a pedantic, pedestrian,

40:21.795 --> 40:24.506
immature, irrelevant,
unliterate,

40:24.506 --> 40:27.009
stupid fucking thing to say.

40:27.009 --> 40:29.678
If you're gonna make
cannabis, or marijuana,

40:29.678 --> 40:32.097
a Schedule 1 controlled
substance right there

40:32.097 --> 40:34.933
with ecstasy, heroin, and LSD,

40:34.933 --> 40:37.353
then let's put
alcohol in there too.

40:39.104 --> 40:42.816
[Jason] I never quite understood
why there was such a taboo

40:42.816 --> 40:46.945
and consequence around
the use of cannabis,

40:46.945 --> 40:50.907
whereas alcohol was free-range
if you're 21 and up.

40:50.907 --> 40:52.701
[Dr. Abrams] There are
statistics that suggest

40:52.701 --> 40:55.245
that there might be
a two-fold increased risk

40:55.245 --> 40:56.663
of a driving accident,

40:56.663 --> 40:59.082
compared to an eight-fold
risk with alcohol.

40:59.082 --> 41:01.459
But in states that have
approved cannabis

41:01.459 --> 41:03.086
and made it legal there appears

41:03.086 --> 41:06.298
to be a decrease in
fatal traffic accidents.

41:06.298 --> 41:09.176
[Nick] People that drink alcohol
tend to drive faster,

41:09.176 --> 41:10.593
take more chances,

41:10.593 --> 41:15.349
and they're less aware
of their intoxication.

41:15.349 --> 41:18.685
Marijuana on the other hand,
people are driving slower,

41:18.685 --> 41:20.270
following distance are greater,

41:20.270 --> 41:22.564
the risk-taking
behaviors are less,

41:22.564 --> 41:27.777
and the awareness of the level
of intoxication is much higher.

41:27.777 --> 41:29.446
I'm not saying
smoke a joint and drive,

41:29.446 --> 41:31.031
but I'm just saying,

41:31.031 --> 41:33.825
sometimes when you smoke
joints you gotta go places.

41:33.825 --> 41:35.369
[audience laughing]

41:35.369 --> 41:36.995
Don't get me wrong,
I drink, I have a few drinks.

41:36.995 --> 41:39.081
I hang out with Mr. Alcohol,
That's my boy.

41:39.081 --> 41:41.291
But I'm just saying,
it's a big difference.

41:41.291 --> 41:43.835
All right, here's hanging
out with Mr. Alcohol:

41:43.835 --> 41:46.380
"Oh hey Mr. Alcohol,

41:46.380 --> 41:47.797
what you wanna do?"

41:47.797 --> 41:50.175
"I dunno know man,
let's get on the freeway."

41:50.175 --> 41:52.677
"Okay Mr. Alcohol, let's go."

41:53.887 --> 41:56.265
Then you and Mr. Alcohol
be on the freeway.

41:56.265 --> 41:57.891
"Wah what now?"

41:57.891 --> 41:59.435
"Speed up!"

41:59.435 --> 42:01.644
"All right Mr. Alcohol!"
[loud humming and whoops]

42:02.854 --> 42:06.066
"Oh shit, Mr. Alcohol,
it's the police.

42:06.066 --> 42:07.650
What the fuck should I do?"

42:07.650 --> 42:09.111
"Go faster."

42:09.111 --> 42:11.738
"Okay Mr. Alcohol,
[loud humming], what next?"

42:11.738 --> 42:14.408
"I dunno know, pull over,
tell him to suck your dick."

42:14.408 --> 42:16.576
"That's a great idea
Mr. Alcohol."

42:16.576 --> 42:19.746
"Alright, here they come,
here they come.

42:20.372 --> 42:21.915
Suck my dick!"

42:21.915 --> 42:23.375
[audience laughing]

42:23.375 --> 42:24.793
"Huh?

42:24.793 --> 42:27.796
Oh, hold on I gotta roll
down the window right."

42:27.796 --> 42:29.589
Suck my dick, bitch!

42:29.589 --> 42:33.260
"Oh Mr. Alcohol,
they whoopin' our ass!"

42:33.260 --> 42:35.804
And Mr. Alcohol would say,
"I didn't say, say bitch."

42:35.804 --> 42:37.555
[audience laughing]

42:37.555 --> 42:39.516
But that's how he'll do you.

42:39.516 --> 42:42.478
You see, hanging out with Mr.
Weed, it's totally different.

42:42.478 --> 42:44.104
Hanging with Mr. Weed:

42:44.104 --> 42:46.106
"Hey Mr. Weed,
what you wanna do?"

42:46.106 --> 42:48.275
"Uh, I don't know,

42:49.401 --> 42:51.194
I think we're hungry though."

42:51.194 --> 42:53.696
[audience laughing]

42:53.696 --> 42:56.533
"Right again, Mr. Weed.

42:56.533 --> 42:58.743
Well, let's go to the store,

42:58.743 --> 43:00.329
you think we should drive?"

43:00.329 --> 43:02.789
"Hey man,
we're not gonna go fast."

43:02.789 --> 43:05.000
[audience laughing]

43:05.000 --> 43:08.337
"Besides, you've driven
a thousand times."

43:08.337 --> 43:10.130
"This is true."

43:10.130 --> 43:14.050
And there you'll be,
driving Mr. Weed.

43:14.050 --> 43:17.637
"Oh yeah, you become a precision
driver when you're high."

43:19.055 --> 43:20.474
"I'll take this left."

43:20.474 --> 43:23.059
[audience laughing]

43:24.394 --> 43:26.438
"I didn't like that
turn there, Mr. Weed.

43:26.438 --> 43:29.191
I think you should've
leaned into it more."

43:29.191 --> 43:32.277
"Yeah alright Mr. Weed,
what now?"

43:32.277 --> 43:34.530
"Let's get on the freeway
go to that McDonalds."

43:34.530 --> 43:37.824
"Alright, they do got the
hot nuggets down there."

43:37.824 --> 43:39.451
[audience laughing]

43:39.451 --> 43:41.578
"Check the mirror,
check the side,"

43:41.578 --> 43:43.539
"check the side,
check the mirror."

43:43.539 --> 43:45.374
[audience laughing]

43:45.374 --> 43:47.376
"We are so good at this man."

43:47.376 --> 43:48.460
"Oh yeah."

43:48.460 --> 43:49.503
"Whoo-woo!"

43:49.503 --> 43:51.963
"Oh shit, oh shit, Mr. Weed."

43:51.963 --> 43:56.593
"Hey, hey motherfucker
what's this panicky shit?

43:56.593 --> 43:58.554
You're not a rookie."

43:58.554 --> 44:03.225
"That's right, that's right,
I don't get paranoid anymore.

44:03.225 --> 44:05.185
I know what to say.
Right, Mr. Weed?"

44:05.185 --> 44:07.937
"That's right, compliment him on
the uniform first off the bat.

44:07.937 --> 44:10.648
[audience laughing]

44:10.648 --> 44:12.484
"Why hello officer.

44:12.484 --> 44:15.653
My are they tailor
fitting you guys nowadays?"

44:17.947 --> 44:19.032
"What now?"

44:19.032 --> 44:20.116
"Relax.

44:20.116 --> 44:21.910
Not that much.

44:23.661 --> 44:25.247
Give him the paperwork."

44:28.458 --> 44:29.751
"What now?"

44:29.751 --> 44:32.629
"Just relax,
ten o'clock two o'clock."

44:37.259 --> 44:38.635
"All right.

55:58.064 --> 56:00.649
completely opposite
of the people

56:00.649 --> 56:02.818
and the culture around it,

56:02.818 --> 56:04.612
and I think it's because,

56:04.612 --> 56:07.823
honestly, here, a lot of
rich people smoke weed.

56:07.823 --> 56:09.158
And they were like,

56:09.158 --> 56:10.576
"I don't wanna go to
jail for smoking weed."

56:10.576 --> 56:12.161
So rich people paid to
have the laws changed.

56:12.161 --> 56:14.538
If you don't love cannabis

56:14.538 --> 56:16.874
and you're not passionate
about cannabis,

56:16.874 --> 56:19.668
it's gonna be hard to grow
really great cannabis.

56:19.668 --> 56:22.088
[Blake] Any idiot can grow pot,
it's a fucking plant,

56:22.088 --> 56:23.214
you water it, it'll grow.

56:23.214 --> 56:24.506
But there's those of us

56:24.506 --> 56:26.217
that spend the time
doing the research.

56:26.217 --> 56:27.969
We go and we find the masters
and we learn from them.

56:27.969 --> 56:31.055
Cannabis cultivation
is part science,

56:31.055 --> 56:32.848
and part art.

56:32.848 --> 56:37.019
And certainly I think part luck.

56:37.019 --> 56:38.729
Welcome to Dank by Pank Gardens.

56:38.729 --> 56:41.190
This is our awesome
propagation room.

56:41.190 --> 56:42.608
I'm gonna tell you,
this is one of the most

56:42.608 --> 56:45.027
important rooms
in our entire garden.

56:45.027 --> 56:47.696
When you come down here, you'll
see all of our teen plants

56:47.696 --> 56:49.282
that just came out
of the cloner.

56:49.282 --> 56:51.242
These have been growing
for about two weeks,

56:51.242 --> 56:52.785
so they're really
starting to rip.

56:52.785 --> 56:54.536
[peaceful soothing music]

56:56.372 --> 56:59.458
This is an aeroponic cloner
and I wanna show you underneath,

56:59.458 --> 57:01.210
if you want to
take a quick look.

57:01.210 --> 57:04.213
You can see all the roots inside
of it which are really fun.

57:04.213 --> 57:05.840
We've turned this off.

57:05.840 --> 57:08.301
Normally, we have water
spraying out of every red head

57:08.301 --> 57:10.469
and that basically creates
the perfect environment

57:10.469 --> 57:13.306
for hormones to build on the
cambium layer of these cuts,

57:13.306 --> 57:16.142
and really shoot out the huge
root systems that we want.

57:19.020 --> 57:22.357
This is to me,
is the original OG Kush

57:22.357 --> 57:24.025
that's called Ghost OG.

57:24.025 --> 57:26.819
We grow in a medium
right here of coco.

57:26.819 --> 57:29.864
This is organic coco
from inland in Sri Lanka.

57:29.864 --> 57:32.158
So we have it shipped
in containers,

57:32.158 --> 57:33.868
and it comes in bricks.

57:33.868 --> 57:36.204
And we basically
put those bricks in water

57:36.204 --> 57:37.872
and let them sit overnight.

57:37.872 --> 57:39.874
And then we break the bricks
up and it comes into a nice,

57:39.874 --> 57:41.250
fine medium.

57:41.250 --> 57:42.668
You wanna see?

57:42.668 --> 57:43.836
It's like, really nice.

57:43.836 --> 57:45.629
And the reason everyone
is really into

57:45.629 --> 57:47.215
this coco craze right now,

57:47.215 --> 57:50.885
is coco holds about six
times its weight in water

57:50.885 --> 57:53.346
and it also is very high,
like fibers.

57:53.346 --> 57:54.763
So when you feed coco,

57:54.763 --> 57:56.473
it's really easy
for the nutrients

57:56.473 --> 57:58.100
to adhere to the coco fibers.

57:58.100 --> 58:00.061
We've actually won
the Cannabis Cup

58:00.061 --> 58:02.355
with the plants all back
through here a bunch of times.

58:02.355 --> 58:04.273
This is a strain called
Don Shula,

58:04.273 --> 58:06.901
which is just,
it's a winning strain.

58:06.901 --> 58:09.945
It's ironic that we called it
the Don Shula because I mean,

58:09.945 --> 58:11.364
he's the only, you know,

58:11.364 --> 58:13.449
coach that ever won
a full season of football

58:13.449 --> 58:15.284
and the Super Bowl.

58:15.284 --> 58:17.453
I bought marijuana
seeds when I moved here.

58:17.453 --> 58:18.662
Why wouldn't you?

58:18.662 --> 58:20.706
You can legally
buy pot seeds now.

58:20.706 --> 58:22.124
Right? I don't even grow 'em.

58:22.124 --> 58:23.376
I'd just like to walk
around my neighborhood

58:23.376 --> 58:25.169
sprinkle them into
peoples yards.

58:25.169 --> 58:27.796
Hey fuck you,
called the cops on me.

58:27.796 --> 58:30.132
Looks like someone's growing
within 100 feet of a school.

58:30.132 --> 58:31.508
[audience laughing]

58:31.508 --> 58:33.261
And you're at church,
you should know better.

58:33.261 --> 58:34.303
[audience laughing]

58:34.303 --> 58:35.721
[helicopter thrumming]

58:35.721 --> 58:37.181
[police sirens wailing]

58:37.181 --> 58:39.141
[News Anchor] <i> The DEA,</i>
<i>US Marshal Service,</i>

58:39.141 --> 58:42.019
<i>and IRS are raiding
Oaksterdam University</i>

58:42.019 --> 58:44.397
<i>as a school shooting
is taking place</i>

58:44.397 --> 58:46.148
<i>in nearby East Oakland.</i>

58:47.358 --> 58:48.817
It was surreal.

58:48.817 --> 58:51.237
What I remember most
about the day of the raid

58:51.237 --> 58:54.449
is a line of local
law enforcement,

58:54.449 --> 58:56.325
our Oakland Police Department,

58:56.325 --> 58:59.828
trying to stand between
a crowd of hundreds

58:59.828 --> 59:01.956
shouting shame at the DEA

59:01.956 --> 59:04.500
and a hundred or so agents

59:04.500 --> 59:08.212
raiding five
different properties.

59:08.212 --> 59:09.838
[Protestor] We know you
don't wanna be out here

59:09.838 --> 59:11.090
on this assignment.

59:11.090 --> 59:12.549
We know that in
your heart you think

59:12.549 --> 59:14.260
that this assignment
is bullshit.

59:14.260 --> 59:17.096
[Dale] We found out
that a tragedy was going

59:17.096 --> 59:20.308
on a mile away, there
was a school shooting.

59:20.308 --> 59:23.018
It's unknown if
the gunman is still inside

59:23.018 --> 59:26.939
or if the gunman fled
before police arrival.

59:26.939 --> 59:29.358
Our law enforcement
couldn't walk away

59:29.358 --> 59:31.610
because they were
busy protecting the DEA

59:31.610 --> 59:36.198
while they raided a plant
that's never killed anyone.

59:36.198 --> 59:39.201
The idea of that
school shooting happening

59:39.201 --> 59:42.330
and our police
not being able to reply

59:42.330 --> 59:43.914
to it in a timely manner,

59:43.914 --> 59:46.083
and the looks on
the faces of the cops

59:46.083 --> 59:48.419
that were pissed off at having
to be there in the first place,

59:48.419 --> 59:50.587
because our local law
enforcement actually supports

59:50.587 --> 59:52.548
our local cannabis industry.

59:52.548 --> 59:54.550
and nobody told them
that there was going

59:54.550 --> 59:55.801
to be a raid that morning.

59:55.801 --> 59:57.594
It's not easy,
it's not easy at all.

59:57.594 --> 01:00:00.931
The city changes its
regulations or the county,

01:00:00.931 --> 01:00:04.018
or the state, or the government,
or the President changes,

01:00:04.018 --> 01:00:07.522
or whatever it is that is
going to affect this business.

01:00:07.522 --> 01:00:09.273
It's a very
competitive market.

01:00:09.273 --> 01:00:12.151
And we reject
90% of the cannabis

01:00:12.151 --> 01:00:13.777
that comes through our doors.

01:00:13.777 --> 01:00:15.863
Picture a family with an
18 year old child

01:00:15.863 --> 01:00:18.991
who comes to them and says,
"I wanna grow pot."

01:00:18.991 --> 01:00:22.995
That isn't probably
a very easy thing

01:00:22.995 --> 01:00:24.455
for a parent to deal with.

01:00:24.455 --> 01:00:26.790
So it came to a lot
of pushing and pulling,

01:00:26.790 --> 01:00:28.376
a lot of fighting.

01:00:28.376 --> 01:00:30.752
And after the first crop,
when they saw,

01:00:30.752 --> 01:00:32.838
Oh shit, you know, this
kid knows what he's doing

01:00:32.838 --> 01:00:34.549
and can actually
make money on this.

01:00:34.549 --> 01:00:38.677
That kinda started easing
into more of an acceptance.

01:00:38.677 --> 01:00:40.804
[light guitar music]

01:00:47.395 --> 01:00:48.687
When we're growing indoors,

01:00:48.687 --> 01:00:50.147
we're literally
trying to play God.

01:00:50.147 --> 01:00:51.982
We're bringing
the sun from outside

01:00:51.982 --> 01:00:53.317
and we're putting it indoors.

01:00:53.317 --> 01:00:57.029
I tried doing outdoors
and the bugs came,

01:00:57.029 --> 01:00:59.615
so I said, "Fuck it,
I'll build a grow room

01:00:59.615 --> 01:01:00.949
and I'm gonna try and play God."

01:01:00.949 --> 01:01:02.910
[light guitar music]

01:01:21.053 --> 01:01:22.888
[water splashing]

01:01:24.306 --> 01:01:28.060
Inside of the grow room
there is a center box

01:01:28.060 --> 01:01:30.145
and when it goes below
a certain point,

01:01:30.145 --> 01:01:32.356
there's a pump in here
that'll kick on,

01:01:32.356 --> 01:01:35.276
and it literally just
pumps the water, you know,

01:01:35.276 --> 01:01:37.361
underneath my grow room
up through the floor

01:01:37.361 --> 01:01:39.321
and into that center box.

01:01:39.321 --> 01:01:40.906
[whooshing]

01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:44.493
[bubbling]

01:01:44.493 --> 01:01:46.537
Cannabis, to me,
has kinda been a world of

01:01:46.537 --> 01:01:49.164
opening new friendships and

01:01:49.164 --> 01:01:53.043
it's not a drug to me.

01:01:53.043 --> 01:01:56.964
It's not either like a morning
coffee or a sipping wine.

01:01:56.964 --> 01:01:58.507
It's a whole culture.

01:01:58.507 --> 01:02:02.303
It's a whole thing that's
embraced me as who I am.

01:02:04.305 --> 01:02:06.223
I dunno know, it's special.

01:02:06.223 --> 01:02:10.227
And I get all the free pot I
want, and my friends of course.

01:02:16.442 --> 01:02:18.068
You wanna piss a farmer off?

01:02:18.068 --> 01:02:19.987
Tell him how much weed
sells for.

01:02:19.987 --> 01:02:21.489
[audience laughing]

01:02:21.489 --> 01:02:23.115
Like, how much per bushel?

01:02:23.115 --> 01:02:26.661
Holy shit, my buddy
makes more in his closet.

01:02:26.661 --> 01:02:28.621
One light and two plants.

01:02:28.621 --> 01:02:29.955
Good luck with your acreage.

01:02:29.955 --> 01:02:31.457
[drumming]

01:02:31.457 --> 01:02:33.792
Everybody's wondering whether
industrial hemp's

01:02:33.792 --> 01:02:35.085
going to make a come back.

01:02:35.085 --> 01:02:36.671
I remember finding
out that my grandparents

01:02:36.671 --> 01:02:40.132
actually grew hemp back
before it was made illegal.

01:02:40.132 --> 01:02:42.510
It was used, of course,
for rope, and cloth,

01:02:42.510 --> 01:02:43.844
and a myriad of things.

01:02:43.844 --> 01:02:45.554
My wife and I,
we drink hemp milk,

01:02:45.554 --> 01:02:49.350
we use hemp soaps,
we have hemp clothing.

01:02:49.350 --> 01:02:51.143
It's not marijuana, it's hemp.

01:02:51.143 --> 01:02:54.062
It's used as fiber.
It's used for paper,

01:02:54.062 --> 01:02:56.482
It's used even in some plastics.

01:02:56.482 --> 01:02:58.817
This is,
this is actually a resource

01:02:58.817 --> 01:03:01.778
that it doesn't take
intensive quantities of water

01:03:01.778 --> 01:03:03.698
in a dry, semi-arid state.

01:03:03.698 --> 01:03:06.659
Something like hemp could
be the new cash crop

01:03:06.659 --> 01:03:09.995
to really answer
some of the economic woes

01:03:09.995 --> 01:03:12.414
that we have in our
rural parts of our state.

01:03:12.414 --> 01:03:14.208
I think industrial hemp
is gonna play

01:03:14.208 --> 01:03:16.960
a very important role in
saving the planet Earth.

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:19.880
[Dr. Sappal] You'll notice we
have a hemp museum downstairs

01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:22.675
and you can see everything that
we can produce just from hemp.

01:03:22.675 --> 01:03:24.719
So a lot of countries are
moving forward with it.

01:03:24.719 --> 01:03:27.095
There's a reason why cannabis
is a Schedule 1 substance.

01:03:27.095 --> 01:03:30.015
The moment it changes,
there's a lot of big businesses,

01:03:30.015 --> 01:03:32.393
I'm talking about billion dollar
international corporations,

01:03:32.393 --> 01:03:34.978
and they're gonna lose tens
of billions of dollars.

01:03:34.978 --> 01:03:36.772
So they will do
everything they can

01:03:36.772 --> 01:03:38.273
to stop that from happening.

01:03:38.273 --> 01:03:40.776
[Earl] We were
in Skagway, Alaska.

01:03:40.776 --> 01:03:42.861
I was doing a movie with
Woody Harrelson,

01:03:42.861 --> 01:03:44.279
of course
you hang out with Woody,

01:03:44.279 --> 01:03:45.573
you smoke with Woody.

01:03:45.573 --> 01:03:47.282
He had just
recently gotten arrested.

01:03:47.282 --> 01:03:48.492
He had gone to Kentucky,

01:03:48.492 --> 01:03:50.244
'cause he's all about
hemp activism

01:03:50.244 --> 01:03:51.870
and the multiple usages of hemp.

01:03:51.870 --> 01:03:53.706
And he's telling me the story.

01:03:53.706 --> 01:03:58.335
So, having a guitar nearby,
I made up this song on the spot,

01:03:58.335 --> 01:04:00.921
The Ballad of Woody
and His Seed.

01:04:00.921 --> 01:04:06.093
It is written on the
back of a set of sides.

01:04:06.093 --> 01:04:09.221
The lines, a scene that
we had filmed that day.

01:04:09.221 --> 01:04:10.931

You can make those
connections happen,

01:04:58.854 --> 01:05:00.856
where maybe you do have
some business people

01:05:00.856 --> 01:05:03.191
that have those skills
that can partner

01:05:03.191 --> 01:05:05.277
with the growers
that have those skills

01:05:05.277 --> 01:05:08.405
and build successful small
to medium business models.

01:05:08.405 --> 01:05:11.074
[upbeat music]

01:05:11.074 --> 01:05:12.534
[Luke] We were kind of
looking for something

01:05:12.534 --> 01:05:14.787
in downtown L.A.
that was a warehouse

01:05:14.787 --> 01:05:16.955
that had a little bit
of edge to it. There was a vibe.

01:05:16.955 --> 01:05:20.250
The dinner didn't start when you
sat down ate your first bite.

01:05:20.250 --> 01:05:21.960
The dinner started when
you got out of your car.

01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:26.674
You walked to this
parking lot, into a building,

01:05:26.674 --> 01:05:28.759
and then you were transformed
the whole thing.

01:05:28.759 --> 01:05:31.928
Playing visuals on the wall,
we wanted a whole experience.

01:05:31.928 --> 01:05:34.014
'Cause to me it's like,
that's what dining is,

01:05:34.014 --> 01:05:35.557
it's all encompassing.

01:05:35.557 --> 01:05:38.727
It's not just the food,
it's not just the service.

01:05:38.727 --> 01:05:42.356
It's a good feeling because
my thought was with doing this

01:05:42.356 --> 01:05:46.318
I've kind of destigmatized
the idea of edible cannabis.

01:05:50.322 --> 01:05:52.658
As I started working
with some of the farmers

01:05:52.658 --> 01:05:55.076
and whatever it might be that
they brought to the table,

01:05:55.076 --> 01:05:56.662
we treated it as an ingredient.

01:05:56.662 --> 01:05:59.748
First and foremost in the
style of cooking that I do,

01:05:59.748 --> 01:06:02.501
it's using ingredients that
are fresh and seasonal.

01:06:02.501 --> 01:06:05.420
To take that with the
different strains of cannabis

01:06:05.420 --> 01:06:07.381
that paired best with those.

01:06:08.883 --> 01:06:12.010
As cannabis comes further
into legalization,

01:06:12.010 --> 01:06:15.723
I 100% think that this is the
future of cuisine in general.

01:06:15.723 --> 01:06:19.309
I want people to eat and
enjoy and not be wrecked.

01:06:21.854 --> 01:06:24.314
Something like this where
you're doing fine dining

01:06:24.314 --> 01:06:26.525
and elevated food,
I think now as we can

01:06:26.525 --> 01:06:29.152
kind of dip our toe into
bringing it to the masses.

01:06:37.452 --> 01:06:39.120
The more and more
people play with this,

01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:41.540
the more you can find
the right magic,

01:06:41.540 --> 01:06:45.460
small dose per item so that
you can enjoy the food,

01:06:45.460 --> 01:06:49.924
but then you can also get
that elated experience as well

01:06:49.924 --> 01:06:51.550
and the satisfaction from it

01:06:51.550 --> 01:06:56.012
without being curled up in
a fetal position. [chuckles]

01:06:56.012 --> 01:06:56.972
[static]

01:06:56.972 --> 01:06:58.933
Hi, my name is Chef Niko.

01:06:58.933 --> 01:07:00.976
And I'm gonna show you
how my cannabis recipes

01:07:00.976 --> 01:07:02.853
will spice up
more than your palate.

01:07:02.853 --> 01:07:04.730
My food will not only
taste better,

01:07:04.730 --> 01:07:06.273
but will make you feel better,

01:07:06.273 --> 01:07:09.150
and you will never look at
food the same way again.

01:07:11.528 --> 01:07:14.448
I have four kids, so when
I'm ready to go to an event,

01:07:14.448 --> 01:07:16.116
they always tell me like,

01:07:16.116 --> 01:07:19.202
"Oh, are you gonna go and
cook for people that need it,

01:07:19.202 --> 01:07:20.913
or are they really sick?

01:07:20.913 --> 01:07:23.331
And I always tell them,
you know like,

01:07:23.331 --> 01:07:25.250
"Some of them are sick,
some of them are not."

01:07:25.250 --> 01:07:28.420
[upbeat music]

01:07:28.420 --> 01:07:30.881
Here we have some nice
Kobe beef,

01:07:30.881 --> 01:07:33.174
and we're gonna make
three patties.

01:07:33.174 --> 01:07:35.093
And you can just press 'em
with your hand,

01:07:35.093 --> 01:07:36.637
like if you're
caressing a woman.

01:07:36.637 --> 01:07:39.180
Nice, thick, juicy.

01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:41.850
Next, we're gonna add
some herb butter

01:07:41.850 --> 01:07:43.852
to the pan in the back.

01:07:43.852 --> 01:07:45.980
We can put down our burgers.

01:07:46.563 --> 01:07:48.398
[sizzling]

01:07:56.239 --> 01:07:58.074
You take the extract,

01:07:58.074 --> 01:07:59.994
I would take about that much.

01:07:59.994 --> 01:08:02.370
I mean, it's literally that much

01:08:02.370 --> 01:08:06.291
that would
medicate three people.

01:08:06.291 --> 01:08:10.170
Once all of it has melted
into it, two quail eggs.

01:08:10.170 --> 01:08:12.631
Next, we're gonna fry our buns.

01:08:12.631 --> 01:08:16.176
Once you've got them
to soak up all the oil,

01:08:16.176 --> 01:08:18.553
they should look nice
and toasted, like that.

01:08:18.553 --> 01:08:20.596
[upbeat music]

01:08:30.649 --> 01:08:34.486
This is my take on the most
expensive cannabis burger,

01:08:34.486 --> 01:08:36.488
and I hope you guys enjoy it.

01:08:36.488 --> 01:08:38.198
[upbeat music]

01:08:45.997 --> 01:08:47.707
[train clacking]

01:08:51.752 --> 01:08:53.796
[birds chirping]

01:08:55.049 --> 01:08:57.216
[rock music]

01:09:03.057 --> 01:09:06.142
Everyone here that
checks into my place

01:09:06.142 --> 01:09:09.229
is cannabis friendly, is
passionate about cannabis,

01:09:09.229 --> 01:09:10.981
and loves cannabis.

01:09:10.981 --> 01:09:13.984
What they have never experienced
is the ability to smoke freely.

01:09:17.529 --> 01:09:19.613
When we created this
place I said to Joel,

01:09:19.613 --> 01:09:23.577
"If we're doing this, we're
doing over the top hospitality."

01:09:23.577 --> 01:09:25.662
A secure, warm,

01:09:25.662 --> 01:09:28.832
comfortable place
for people to smoke.

01:09:35.005 --> 01:09:37.131
Cooking and entertaining
has always been

01:09:37.131 --> 01:09:38.633
my love and my passion.

01:09:41.176 --> 01:09:43.055
We want every guest to feel

01:09:43.055 --> 01:09:44.639
like they're the only
guest here,

01:09:44.639 --> 01:09:46.767
but the beauty of the
place is that they're not,

01:09:46.767 --> 01:09:51.020
and people love to smoke
cannabis with other people.

01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:55.067
And our guests come in and
within 10 to 15 minutes

01:09:55.067 --> 01:09:57.652
they've known
each other forever.

01:09:57.652 --> 01:09:59.571
[rock music]

01:10:03.199 --> 01:10:05.493
[Joel] On any given
night there'll be 12 people

01:10:05.493 --> 01:10:09.414
playing board games and
passing joints all night long.

01:10:09.414 --> 01:10:11.125
[whooshing]

01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:20.050
[coughing and exhaling]

01:10:25.346 --> 01:10:27.015
The guests that we have here

01:10:27.015 --> 01:10:30.060
varies from 21 year olds
to 81 year olds.

01:10:31.645 --> 01:10:34.522
[Lisa] We get people from
all over the world.

01:10:34.522 --> 01:10:37.776
Doctors, lawyers, veterans,

01:10:37.776 --> 01:10:39.694
ex-military, principals,

01:10:39.694 --> 01:10:42.906
teachers, you name it,
across the board.

01:10:45.117 --> 01:10:47.452
Our guests walk down
in the morning,

01:10:47.452 --> 01:10:50.664
and the first thing they
hear is, "Oh, how'd you sleep?

01:10:50.664 --> 01:10:51.957
Would you like a mimosa?"

01:10:51.957 --> 01:10:54.042
They cannot believe
that they can sit

01:10:54.042 --> 01:10:56.419
in a beautiful living room,
a beautiful dining room,

01:10:56.419 --> 01:10:58.630
a beautiful patio and smoke.

01:10:58.630 --> 01:11:02.342
So their appetite is wonderful
for our great breakfast.

01:11:05.846 --> 01:11:08.015
We have a full
paraphernalia bar.

01:11:08.015 --> 01:11:10.433
So they don't need to
purchase anything

01:11:10.433 --> 01:11:12.019
to smoke their cannabis with.

01:11:12.019 --> 01:11:15.396
Some people just like to
stay here all day and relax,

01:11:15.396 --> 01:11:18.358
other people, we have the
Botanic Gardens right here,

01:11:18.358 --> 01:11:21.778
we have the Denver Zoo,
the museum, downtown Denver,

01:11:21.778 --> 01:11:23.697
and then they all come back

01:11:23.697 --> 01:11:26.158
and gather together for
420 Happy Hour.

01:11:26.158 --> 01:11:28.368
[rock music]

01:11:42.632 --> 01:11:44.718
[Joel] 420 is a happy time.

01:11:44.718 --> 01:11:46.761
It's the best happy hour
there is.

01:11:54.310 --> 01:11:56.104
[busy street footfalls]

01:11:56.771 --> 01:11:58.773
[funky music]

01:12:01.068 --> 01:12:03.528
I'm the president of
Strava Craft Coffee.

01:12:03.528 --> 01:12:05.321
We're a local specialty
coffee roaster.

01:12:05.321 --> 01:12:07.282
We've been in business
for a year and a half.

01:12:07.282 --> 01:12:10.244
We chose to celebrate
the infusion of cannabis

01:12:10.244 --> 01:12:12.620
into some really
fantastic coffee.

01:12:13.747 --> 01:12:15.456
The really great thing
about Denver

01:12:15.456 --> 01:12:18.501
is that it's a community
of innovators, of makers,

01:12:18.501 --> 01:12:20.003
of specialty foods,

01:12:20.003 --> 01:12:21.379
of specialty experiences,

01:12:21.379 --> 01:12:23.882
and as we've moved into
the cannabis community

01:12:23.882 --> 01:12:25.383
with our hemp-infused coffee,

01:12:25.383 --> 01:12:27.635
we've connected with
members of this community

01:12:27.635 --> 01:12:29.304
that are extremely supportive.

01:12:29.304 --> 01:12:30.764
They believe in our vision

01:12:30.764 --> 01:12:32.515
and they help connect us
with resources.

01:12:32.515 --> 01:12:36.853
We're using a hemp-derived CBD
oil to infuse into the beans,

01:12:36.853 --> 01:12:40.232
and it produces some really
fantastic results for consumers.

01:12:40.232 --> 01:12:42.150
You can enjoy a
couple cups of coffee

01:12:42.150 --> 01:12:44.111
and not worry about
coffee jitters,

01:12:44.111 --> 01:12:46.863
and it's fantastic for
alleviating anxiety as well.

01:12:48.698 --> 01:12:51.492
We roast all of our coffees
here in Denver, Colorado.

01:12:51.492 --> 01:12:53.578
We do the infusions
here as well,

01:12:53.578 --> 01:12:56.372
and then package up in 12 ounce
bags of whole bean coffee,

01:12:56.372 --> 01:12:59.000
and we sell those at a couple
of cafes locally in town,

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.628
and we do sell those online
and they can order right there

01:13:01.628 --> 01:13:03.130
and we'll ship directly
to their house.

01:13:03.130 --> 01:13:06.216
You can prepare it via
French press or aeropress,

01:13:06.216 --> 01:13:08.260
however you like to prepare
your coffee at home.

01:13:13.556 --> 01:13:16.893
[upbeat music]

01:13:16.893 --> 01:13:19.229
High End Transportation
is a luxury vehicle company

01:13:19.229 --> 01:13:21.648
that caters to the
420 community.

01:13:22.941 --> 01:13:26.236
We are veteran owned,
women owned,

01:13:26.236 --> 01:13:29.156
and just 100% diversified
in our company.

01:13:32.117 --> 01:13:34.202
We create experiences for people

01:13:34.202 --> 01:13:36.371
who like to
indulge in a journey.

01:13:37.914 --> 01:13:39.749
We'll pick you up
from the airport

01:13:39.749 --> 01:13:41.584
in one of our luxury vehicles.

01:13:43.128 --> 01:13:45.463
We'll take you to a dispensary
where you can load up

01:13:45.463 --> 01:13:47.299
and get your first joint on.

01:13:50.551 --> 01:13:52.679
You get all your drivers
fingerprinted, you know,

01:13:52.679 --> 01:13:55.265
background checks, physicals,
make sure they're safe

01:13:55.265 --> 01:13:56.766
to drive on the road.

01:13:58.352 --> 01:14:01.521
Once they're all limo'd up
and our cars are licensed

01:14:01.521 --> 01:14:03.439
and they have all their
numbers on there,

01:14:03.439 --> 01:14:05.150
you can go in there and
hotbox with your friends,

01:14:05.150 --> 01:14:06.776
and do whatever you want,
you know.

01:14:06.776 --> 01:14:08.153
Fifteen passengers or more,

01:14:08.153 --> 01:14:10.322
have a good time
and it won't affect our driver.

01:14:10.322 --> 01:14:12.699
But definitely,
our service is meant

01:14:12.699 --> 01:14:14.617
to give you a safe place
to consume

01:14:14.617 --> 01:14:17.453
while you enjoy the sights
of Denver, Colorado.

01:14:19.664 --> 01:14:21.208
I love weed.

01:14:21.208 --> 01:14:22.250
I love it.

01:14:22.250 --> 01:14:23.543
I love it!

01:14:23.543 --> 01:14:24.669
[audience laughing]

01:14:24.669 --> 01:14:26.296
I don't like it, I love it.

01:14:27.339 --> 01:14:28.756
You know why I love it.

01:14:28.756 --> 01:14:30.550
Well maybe you don't,
but I'll tell you

01:14:30.550 --> 01:14:33.136
'cause I'm not ashamed,
I'm not ashamed.

01:14:33.136 --> 01:14:34.512
Don't you forget.

01:14:34.512 --> 01:14:38.016
Don't you forget who...

01:14:38.016 --> 01:14:39.684
made marijuana.

01:14:39.684 --> 01:14:41.728
That's right. It wasn't me,

01:14:41.728 --> 01:14:43.688
it was none of you either.

01:14:45.106 --> 01:14:46.649

01:14:46.649 --> 01:14:48.526
[audience laughing]

01:14:48.526 --> 01:14:49.944
That's right.

01:14:50.570 --> 01:14:52.780
Our Father.

01:14:52.780 --> 01:14:54.449
He made it for us.

01:14:54.449 --> 01:14:59.704
He made it for us because he
wants us to smoke that shit.

01:14:59.704 --> 01:15:00.914
[audience laughing]

01:15:00.914 --> 01:15:02.207
And eat muffins and shit.

01:15:02.207 --> 01:15:03.791

01:15:03.791 --> 01:15:07.003

I own Sweet Grass Kitchen.

01:15:07.003 --> 01:15:09.172
We make cannabutter
base edibles.

01:15:14.844 --> 01:15:18.390
So this is
Sweet Grass's cultivation.

01:15:18.390 --> 01:15:20.100
We grow everything in-house

01:15:20.100 --> 01:15:23.270
because we wanna make sure that
every time you have an edible,

01:15:23.270 --> 01:15:25.021
whether it's a brownie,
or a cookie,

01:15:25.021 --> 01:15:27.190
or you're eating it today
or six months from now,

01:15:27.190 --> 01:15:29.525
that you're getting
the same experience.

01:15:31.903 --> 01:15:35.531
It's not required by regulation
to grow our own product.

01:15:35.531 --> 01:15:39.411
We really want to be sure
that we're seeing everything

01:15:39.411 --> 01:15:40.787
from a five inch tall plant

01:15:40.787 --> 01:15:43.623
to the cookie that
comes out at the end.

01:15:45.541 --> 01:15:48.169
Every room in the
facility has its purpose.

01:15:48.169 --> 01:15:51.047
So this is where we do all
of our scaling and mixing.

01:15:51.047 --> 01:15:55.009
Everything from the harvest
comes into here, we process it.

01:15:57.178 --> 01:16:00.723
You can actually see
Brittney here scooping some

01:16:00.723 --> 01:16:03.559
of our cannabutter
into the mixer there.

01:16:03.559 --> 01:16:05.561
So the tub that
she has in her hand

01:16:05.561 --> 01:16:07.855
can make about 20,000 cookies.

01:16:07.855 --> 01:16:12.193
That's 200,000 milligrams
of THC in one bucket,

01:16:12.193 --> 01:16:15.696
so you'd get pretty high
if you ate the whole thing.

01:16:20.952 --> 01:16:23.163
It's a sativa dominant hybrid.

01:16:23.163 --> 01:16:25.957
The experience and the effects
that you'll get from that

01:16:25.957 --> 01:16:28.668
is more of a energetic effect.

01:16:46.186 --> 01:16:49.022
All edibles companies now
have to stamp their product

01:16:49.022 --> 01:16:51.566
in some way
in order to make sure

01:16:51.566 --> 01:16:55.111
that consumers know exactly
what's in the product.

01:16:55.111 --> 01:16:58.532
This machine laser-engraves
every single product

01:16:58.532 --> 01:17:03.203
that we have, so it's a
pretty clean way of staying

01:17:03.203 --> 01:17:05.288
in compliance with
these regulatory changes

01:17:05.288 --> 01:17:08.249
while making sure that consumers
are safe in their consumption.

01:17:17.425 --> 01:17:20.053
I'm happy knowing that
Sweet Grass

01:17:20.053 --> 01:17:22.514
and everyone involved
with it is participating

01:17:22.514 --> 01:17:24.307
in this incredible
piece of history.

01:17:24.307 --> 01:17:27.143
That my best hope for
the future, my dream is

01:17:27.143 --> 01:17:31.105
to make it into a national
and international company.

01:17:31.105 --> 01:17:32.940
[techno music]

01:17:35.402 --> 01:17:38.779
Originally, I came out
to California working

01:17:38.779 --> 01:17:40.948
in the music industry.

01:17:40.948 --> 01:17:44.077
Being in shops and seeing
where trends were going,

01:17:44.077 --> 01:17:48.415
I actually saw
the first vape pen.

01:17:48.415 --> 01:17:51.042
At that time, it was
such a new technology,

01:17:51.042 --> 01:17:53.378
I just remember that
moment being in the shop,

01:17:53.378 --> 01:17:55.630
hitting it, and being like,
"This is the future."

01:17:57.340 --> 01:18:00.885
You just unscrew the top,
just load the concentrate

01:18:00.885 --> 01:18:04.514
in the top here, press
the button five times.

01:18:06.474 --> 01:18:08.476
[exhaling]

01:18:08.476 --> 01:18:09.894
That's it.

01:18:11.771 --> 01:18:15.149
This is currently our
top selling product,

01:18:15.149 --> 01:18:17.818
with this being
exclusively for herb.

01:18:17.818 --> 01:18:19.779
It heats up in under 30 seconds.

01:18:20.655 --> 01:18:22.532
We don't touch the plant.

01:18:24.284 --> 01:18:26.244
What's amazing about it
as a product

01:18:26.244 --> 01:18:29.497
is all you have to do is
screw it on and hit a button.

01:18:29.497 --> 01:18:31.625
The difference of having
to actually take weed,

01:18:31.625 --> 01:18:33.460
put your hands on it,
break it up.

01:18:33.460 --> 01:18:35.420
It eliminates so much of that,

01:18:35.420 --> 01:18:37.797
and I think
that's the attraction.

01:18:42.677 --> 01:18:44.679
[peaceful tranquil music]

01:18:51.352 --> 01:18:53.104
[Dr. Shu] While I was
a veterinarian,

01:18:53.104 --> 01:18:55.440
we prescribed a lot of
different medications.

01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:58.485
And a lot of times they
were for very common causes.

01:18:58.485 --> 01:19:01.488
For example, a lot of
pets will get arthritis.

01:19:02.738 --> 01:19:05.825
The medications that
we use for arthritis

01:19:05.825 --> 01:19:08.035
can have negative effects
on the kidney

01:19:08.035 --> 01:19:09.621
or the liver, for example.

01:19:09.621 --> 01:19:11.998
And so looking at cannabis,

01:19:11.998 --> 01:19:14.626
we found that CBD
and other cannabinoids can be

01:19:14.626 --> 01:19:16.419
very effective for arthritis,

01:19:16.419 --> 01:19:18.338
pain, nausea, vomiting,

01:19:18.338 --> 01:19:21.174
separation anxiety or
noise anxiety.

01:19:21.174 --> 01:19:23.468
We wanted to make sure
that we had something

01:19:23.468 --> 01:19:25.595
that was not only safe
for them to consume,

01:19:25.595 --> 01:19:27.805
but that was
tailor-made for them.

01:19:33.894 --> 01:19:35.855
[Dog Owner] Good boy!
What do you think?

01:19:35.855 --> 01:19:38.107
There you go, good boy.

01:19:38.107 --> 01:19:40.109
[peaceful tranquil music]

01:19:46.824 --> 01:19:48.784
A lot of people are
concerned about cannabis

01:19:48.784 --> 01:19:50.745
and the high effect.

01:19:52.205 --> 01:19:55.249
The product that we've created,
there is no high.

01:19:58.127 --> 01:20:01.756
It's a ratio of about
twenty-to-one CBD to THC.

01:20:01.756 --> 01:20:03.675
There's a small amount
of THC in there,

01:20:03.675 --> 01:20:05.968
but that THC
is medicinally effective.

01:20:05.968 --> 01:20:08.929
It doesn't cause a high
because we have a lot more CBD

01:20:08.929 --> 01:20:12.559
to counteract that, so
owners don't have to worry.

01:20:16.229 --> 01:20:18.898
The most rewarding thing
is hearing the feedback.

01:20:18.898 --> 01:20:21.735
All pet owners should
be able to have access

01:20:21.735 --> 01:20:24.987
to medicine like this, you know,
especially for their pets.

01:20:28.700 --> 01:20:32.161
[upbeat music]

01:20:32.161 --> 01:20:33.621
[Butterfly] Where I'm from,
it's really hard

01:20:33.621 --> 01:20:35.915
to find good product,
and when you do find it,

01:20:35.915 --> 01:20:37.250
it's gonna be expensive.

01:20:37.250 --> 01:20:39.419

01:20:45.174 --> 01:20:48.803

scene is a lot more vibrant.

01:20:48.803 --> 01:20:50.888

01:21:00.981 --> 01:21:03.192
There's growers,
there's people in competitions

01:21:03.192 --> 01:21:04.611
with each other
to create product

01:21:04.611 --> 01:21:06.237

01:21:06.237 --> 01:21:08.948

of stores across the state.

01:21:18.374 --> 01:21:20.334

wanted to be able to, like,

01:21:20.334 --> 01:21:23.296
have a boring ass job and smoke
a bowl and not go to jail.

01:21:23.296 --> 01:21:25.214
Then I realized the potential,

01:21:25.214 --> 01:21:27.925
and now I'm here to
make money and succeed.
