WEBVTT

00:16.182 --> 00:17.225
What’s up, Drew?

00:17.350 --> 00:18.685
- Hey, what's going on?
- Hey, man.

00:22.063 --> 00:26.693
<i>A-haw haw haw-haw
Heh, a-haw haw haw</i>

00:26.901 --> 00:31.906
<i>Well, I hear it's fine if you got the time</i>

00:32.907 --> 00:36.911
<i>And the ten to get yourself in</i>

00:37.037 --> 00:40.415
<i>When I realized that I would
not be part of the AMS spacewalks,</i>

00:40.540 --> 00:42.333
<i>I definitely was disappointed.</i>

00:42.792 --> 00:46.880
<i>I feel really tied to them.
And the whole team, I feel part of it.</i>

00:53.428 --> 00:56.347
When you have your mind set
on a goal and it doesn’t work out,

00:57.098 --> 00:58.808
<i>it can get you down.</i>

00:58.892 --> 01:01.478
<i>We’re all human
and nobody likes a setback.</i>

01:01.561 --> 01:03.104
<i>Nobody likes disappointment
and I’m no different.</i>

01:03.855 --> 01:05.690
<i>But I’ve been around
this business long enough</i>

01:05.857 --> 01:07.901
<i>to know that you can’t
get married to a launch date.</i>

01:08.068 --> 01:09.694
<i>-You can’t get married to a task.</i>

01:32.550 --> 01:33.802
Yeah.

01:52.987 --> 01:54.030
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:54.114 --> 01:55.990
No worries.
- Thanks for having us.

01:56.074 --> 01:57.700
- Pleasure. Thanks.
Thanks a lot, guys.

01:58.118 --> 01:59.953
<i>My role now
is to impart the knowledge</i>

02:00.036 --> 02:01.955
<i>I’ve gained from a year
and a half of training</i>

02:02.122 --> 02:03.206
<i>on to Drew and Luca.</i>

02:06.417 --> 02:08.128
<i>Do I wish I was out there with them?</i>

02:09.337 --> 02:10.463
<i>Absolutely.</i>

02:30.358 --> 02:32.819
<i>Spectacular view
at an orbital sunset</i>

02:32.902 --> 02:36.072
<i>of the approaching Soyuz MS-13.</i>

02:36.614 --> 02:39.200
<i>Just a couple of moments from now.</i>

03:01.181 --> 03:03.850
<i>The two vehicles
about two hundred meters from each other.</i>

03:04.726 --> 03:11.024
<i>And you can see thruster firings on
the Soyuz as it prepares to park itself.</i>

03:30.543 --> 03:32.253
<i>I’m expecting contact.</i>

03:36.925 --> 03:38.760
<i>Do you have contact.
Contact confirmed.</i>

03:38.843 --> 03:42.472
<i>Contact confirmed,
capture confirmed. Docking confirmed.</i>

04:17.257 --> 04:19.133
<i>And NASA astronaut Drew Morgan</i>

04:19.259 --> 04:21.427
<i>now aboard
the International Space Station.</i>

04:23.513 --> 04:25.473
You're welcome aboard
the International Space Station.

04:25.556 --> 04:27.225
I have you loud and clear.

04:28.810 --> 04:29.894
Yeah!

04:32.689 --> 04:34.899
Awesome!

04:36.067 --> 04:40.196
I’m doing
the sleeping bag tour of the ISS.

04:43.074 --> 04:47.328
<i>This was my first flight,
my first time in space.</i>

04:48.621 --> 04:50.456
<i>I felt this overwhelming sense of,</i>

04:50.540 --> 04:52.959
<i>"Wow, I can’t believe
that I’m on the ISS."</i>

04:53.501 --> 04:56.421
<i>"I can’t believe that
they’re allowing me to do this!"</i>

05:01.175 --> 05:03.886
<i>You know, I’ve looked at pictures,
I’ve been to IMAX movies and I’m like,</i>

05:04.053 --> 05:07.098
<i>"Does it really look like that?
Does it really look like that?"</i>

05:07.181 --> 05:12.020
<i>"I mean, these mov... these pictures
been modified or enhanced in some way?"</i>

05:13.271 --> 05:16.691
It really looks like that.
Except that it surrounds you.

05:32.165 --> 05:35.209
<i>I felt like a balloon that just wanted
to keep floating to the ceiling</i>

05:35.293 --> 05:37.420
<i>because I didn’t know
how to control my body.</i>

05:37.503 --> 05:39.130
<i>It takes some getting used to.</i>

05:40.923 --> 05:44.844
<i>Well, it’s a lot of fun. The moment
that I first experienced microgravity,</i>

05:44.969 --> 05:47.013
I felt like I was hanging upside down.

05:47.096 --> 05:49.640
Because you’re so used
to gravity pulling you down all the time.

05:51.601 --> 05:54.354
<i>I had that sensation
for the first couple of days</i>

05:54.520 --> 05:57.398
<i>of just feeling a little bit
disorientated all the time.</i>

05:58.524 --> 06:01.110
<i>I was excited to see
Jessica and Christina who have just</i>

06:01.194 --> 06:04.864
<i>only recently conducted
the first all-female spacewalk.</i>

06:06.449 --> 06:10.286
It was so nice. Drew, Christina, and I,
actually, you know, we are all classmates.

06:10.453 --> 06:11.996
<i>We’d gone through training together.</i>

06:12.080 --> 06:14.540
<i>So, we know each other
like brothers and sisters.</i>

06:14.791 --> 06:16.584
Grab the other two...

06:18.503 --> 06:20.755
<i>The difference
was that, as a veteran,</i>

06:21.214 --> 06:23.591
<i>I was really waiting for the moment</i>

06:23.674 --> 06:27.220
<i>where we got into weightlessness
and see Drew’s face.</i>

06:28.304 --> 06:31.516
<i>That's when I was, kinda,
sneaking a look at his face</i>

06:31.641 --> 06:33.601
<i>to catch the big grin that comes to you</i>

06:33.768 --> 06:37.522
<i>when you realize,
"Wow! This is really happening."</i>

06:38.481 --> 06:44.529
<i>There is this shared moment
of just, pure joy.</i>

06:46.864 --> 06:52.078
Time to change command.
This is a symbol of ISS commander.

06:55.665 --> 06:56.666
It’s for you.

07:00.920 --> 07:04.340
Now, you’re ISS commander.
My congratulations.

07:04.674 --> 07:05.675
Thank you.

07:07.885 --> 07:08.886
Thank you, Aleksey.

07:09.804 --> 07:12.306
<i>I feel confident
that even though, right now,</i>

07:12.390 --> 07:14.976
<i>all of the tasks that we have
in front of us look daunting...</i>

07:16.769 --> 07:18.521
we as a crew, will make it happen.

07:19.355 --> 07:20.982
And four months from now,

07:21.065 --> 07:24.610
we’ll be looking at this day thinking,
"Yes, that confidence that we felt,

07:24.735 --> 07:27.822
"the confidence that we feel,
we deserved it."

07:28.698 --> 07:31.242
And I will do the best that I can

07:31.576 --> 07:34.495
to be at your service
to deserve your confidence.

07:35.621 --> 07:39.292
Thank you very much. Thank you all
for listening to these words.

07:42.753 --> 07:43.796
What happens now?

07:45.631 --> 07:46.674
Congratulations.

07:52.305 --> 07:55.892
<i>I feel this very deep
sense of responsibility</i>

07:55.975 --> 07:58.686
<i>because they said, "Okay, Luca,
you are going to be performing</i>

07:58.769 --> 08:02.398
<i>"all the specialized tasks
and Drew will become your support."</i>

08:03.941 --> 08:07.778
<i>We'll get it done.
Drew and I will get it done.</i>

08:08.488 --> 08:10.031
Wow. All right.

08:22.126 --> 08:25.004
<i>The AMS is
a multibillion-dollar experiment</i>

08:25.087 --> 08:26.756
<i>on the outside of the space station.</i>

08:29.300 --> 08:30.885
<i>The reason we care so much about it</i>

08:30.968 --> 08:34.180
<i>is because the data that we get from this
impressive piece of machinery,</i>

08:34.764 --> 08:39.018
it could shape where we go
with the future of space exploration.

08:40.478 --> 08:42.730
<i>Human physiology is not compatible</i>

08:42.813 --> 08:44.857
<i>with long duration
space flight in open space</i>

08:44.982 --> 08:46.567
<i>because of the cosmic rays.</i>

08:47.318 --> 08:50.321
<i>In order for us to become
an interplanetary species,</i>

08:51.072 --> 08:53.741
<i>we need to understand what’s out there.</i>

08:54.075 --> 08:56.869
<i>Now, AMS is capable
of finding out what’s out there.</i>

08:58.704 --> 09:01.874
<i>In space, you’re exposed
to giant temperature swings.</i>

09:02.250 --> 09:04.335
<i>Any part that’s exposed
to direct sunlight,</i>

09:04.460 --> 09:08.714
<i>it’s about
positive 250 degrees Fahrenheit or so.</i>

09:09.257 --> 09:13.803
And then any part that’s in the shade
is minus 200 degrees.

09:14.971 --> 09:18.432
<i>The problem is, right now,
the AMS cooling system is broken.</i>

09:19.267 --> 09:23.646
We’ll be required to do a series of
spacewalks to repair this cooling system

09:23.729 --> 09:25.523
and get back to full health.

09:26.357 --> 09:30.027
<i>The final batch of tools which
Drew and Luca will need for the repair,</i>

09:30.570 --> 09:33.322
<i>will get to the space station
on an unmanned cargo launch.</i>

09:34.407 --> 09:37.285
<i>There’s a really tight window
between the arrival of the tools</i>

09:37.368 --> 09:40.204
<i>on the space station
and the AMS spacewalks.</i>

09:40.871 --> 09:44.041
If we miss the delivery
of those tools on that cargo ship,

09:44.542 --> 09:47.712
the spacewalks will be delayed,
who knows how long.

09:50.965 --> 09:52.258
<i>For the AMS repairs,</i>

09:52.383 --> 09:55.469
<i>Luca and Drew will be the astronauts
in space actually doing the work.</i>

09:56.262 --> 10:00.057
<i>But Jeremy and I are continuing
to train with the team on the ground.</i>

10:00.141 --> 10:02.893
<i>To make sure everything goes smoothly
on the day of the spacewalk.</i>

10:05.688 --> 10:10.359
And now I get to turn
the podium over to Jeremy Hansen.

10:12.278 --> 10:17.450
<i>Jeremy Hansen is the most
talented astronaut I’ve worked with.</i>

10:17.533 --> 10:20.578
He has not flown in space,
but you’d never know it.

10:20.953 --> 10:24.915
Canada truly appreciates
American space leadership.

10:25.082 --> 10:27.126
We have accomplished
incredible things together.

10:27.376 --> 10:31.422
Being a Canadian astronaut,
there're significant time between flights

10:31.505 --> 10:34.383
for Canadians and so,
you know, I’ve been here ten years.

10:34.467 --> 10:37.011
I’m still a number of years away
from flying in space.

10:42.808 --> 10:44.769
This here is the AMS.

10:44.977 --> 10:47.563
This is a one-to-one scale
mockup made out of wood.

10:47.938 --> 10:53.653
This is, you know, a mockup of the box
that we need to put on the AMS,

10:53.736 --> 10:55.363
this is the cooling pump itself.

10:55.821 --> 10:58.532
And CO2, it uses CO2 as its coolant.

10:58.824 --> 11:01.535
And that’s what these tubes are all about,

11:01.619 --> 11:04.038
is they run this new
air conditioning system

11:04.121 --> 11:05.539
that goes into these radiators.

11:05.623 --> 11:10.544
You see one up there. So,
we have to cut into these cooling tubes.

11:11.253 --> 11:14.799
Right inside here, on our mockup here,
we’ve already done the cutting.

11:14.882 --> 11:16.008
You’ve got these ten tubes.

11:16.092 --> 11:18.886
We’ve had to come up
with ways to pull these tubes out,

11:19.428 --> 11:21.639
and then cut them
with bolt cutters almost.

11:21.764 --> 11:23.224
Then you bend them out like this.

11:24.225 --> 11:25.726
And then we can do the connection,

11:25.810 --> 11:28.688
but from, you know,
far away in a spacesuit

11:28.938 --> 11:34.694
at an angle, it can be easy
to misidentify which tubes we’re cutting

11:34.777 --> 11:36.070
'cause we’re not cutting all the tubes.

11:36.779 --> 11:37.905
So, you gotta get this right.

11:38.197 --> 11:41.867
If we did cut the wrong tube,
the AMS will probably break.

11:54.922 --> 11:57.466
<i>As we prepare
a plan for a spacewalk,</i>

11:57.800 --> 12:01.345
<i>we need to run it in the NBL
as many times as we can.</i>

12:02.430 --> 12:07.935
<i>We try to cover as many scenarios as we
can in terms of locations where you’ll be,</i>

12:08.227 --> 12:10.563
<i>nuts and bolts,
and tools that you’ll have to use.</i>

12:11.147 --> 12:15.651
<i>You’re constantly trying to validate
that the process is right.</i>

12:18.028 --> 12:19.864
<i>So,
we’re back here for AMS again.</i>

12:20.823 --> 12:25.077
As we talked last time, we’ve got all
the fun things for Luca to avoid

12:25.161 --> 12:26.245
as he's flying in.

12:26.412 --> 12:29.457
The big one for that is going
to be these cables up here.

12:29.582 --> 12:31.417
Wanna make sure
we’re not running into those.

12:31.625 --> 12:35.880
This is our last run.
So, everything comes out.

12:37.089 --> 12:39.842
- Anything else?
Okay.

12:40.468 --> 12:43.012
<i>Each time you go
outside on a spacewalk,</i>

12:43.345 --> 12:47.683
<i>you are one event away
from blowing the repair</i>

12:47.767 --> 12:51.061
<i>or not getting done
what you set out to do.</i>

12:51.562 --> 12:52.980
I want
to remind everybody up here.

12:53.063 --> 12:56.358
Please keep your phones,
or electronic devices on off or silent.

12:56.525 --> 12:58.444
Okay, I’ve gotta go to work.
We'll see ya.

12:59.779 --> 13:03.699
<i>So, I can run tests in the NBL
to arm Drew and Luca</i>

13:03.783 --> 13:06.994
<i>with all the skills and knowledge
they need to go do the EVAs.</i>

13:08.746 --> 13:09.747
Flight lead.
Go.

13:09.872 --> 13:10.873
EV1.
Go.

13:11.040 --> 13:12.208
EV2.
Go.

13:12.291 --> 13:13.709
Back up.
Go.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.044
- Top side.
- Go.

13:15.169 --> 13:16.170
ECS.
<i>Go.</i>

13:16.295 --> 13:17.296
SSRMS.
Go.

13:17.421 --> 13:19.715
Station call will be at 8:23.

13:20.132 --> 13:22.134
EV2, copy.
Copy on two.

13:34.313 --> 13:36.273
Jeremy,
I’ll need the comm, if you don't mind.

13:36.398 --> 13:38.818
You have the comm,
I’m heading to the worksite, Chris.

13:39.235 --> 13:41.654
<i>Ritchie, EV1.</i>
Yes, sir.

13:42.905 --> 13:44.698
I’m ready
whenever the divers are done.

13:45.407 --> 13:46.450
Copy that.

13:47.576 --> 13:50.120
All right, ready for cutting stuff.

13:50.454 --> 13:52.206
That sounds good to us.

13:53.165 --> 13:54.875
See if I can cut my gloves.

13:55.876 --> 13:57.086
Not allowed to say that.

13:58.254 --> 14:00.422
<i>-But I didn't really look hard in there.</i>

14:01.090 --> 14:02.550
<i>Suddenly, three flight directors</i>

14:02.633 --> 14:04.301
<i>-in the room just stood up.</i>
What?

14:05.594 --> 14:07.429
What, what, what, what?

14:08.180 --> 14:10.558
So, first we’re still
on number six, right?

14:10.724 --> 14:11.976
<i>We are on number six.</i>

14:12.059 --> 14:14.144
Okay. So, copy, right on number six.

14:15.271 --> 14:20.442
Six is gonna be
directly below the previously cut number.

14:21.610 --> 14:23.821
- Seven, correct?
Yep.

14:24.488 --> 14:25.948
<i>Okay. Sounds good.</i>

14:36.333 --> 14:37.376
Six is cut.

14:39.795 --> 14:43.674
Now, we’re doing the lower tubes.
Number eight.

14:45.301 --> 14:49.430
These are the two most dangerous ones
for getting the wrong one, I think.

14:50.347 --> 14:51.348
That's right.

14:54.643 --> 14:59.106
All right, triple checked.
I’m confident I have the right one.

14:59.189 --> 15:01.233
<i>And we’re confident as well.</i>

15:04.987 --> 15:07.031
<i>Only put in what you want to cut,</i>

15:07.489 --> 15:09.241
<i>which is actually good words here.</i>

15:10.701 --> 15:12.036
Got a stubborn one here.

15:14.705 --> 15:17.458
There we go. Number eight is cut.

15:18.250 --> 15:20.586
All right. After we do three,
Sabo, what's next?

15:21.337 --> 15:23.505
So, before we move on to the next task,

15:23.589 --> 15:25.674
I’ll take one more glove
and HAP check from you both.

15:26.425 --> 15:28.427
All right, I’ll give you
my glove check right now.

15:28.510 --> 15:29.887
No change, no damage.

15:30.804 --> 15:33.223
<i>And good HAP.
Hold on, guys.</i>

15:38.812 --> 15:40.105
Just hold for a minute.

15:40.481 --> 15:45.152
So, the one that I have capped
for number eight is really three.

15:50.866 --> 15:53.953
<i>So, the one that’s actually number three,</i>

15:54.995 --> 15:57.373
<i>still needs to be cut. Oh, we have a...</i>

15:59.166 --> 16:01.377
<i>Or, excuse me,
that’s actually number eight.</i>

16:03.379 --> 16:04.463
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

16:10.427 --> 16:11.804
<i>Yeah, I pulled it out.</i>

16:11.887 --> 16:14.181
- Yeah. Okay.
<i>I gotta be able</i>

16:14.264 --> 16:15.516
<i>to do this right.</i>

16:16.308 --> 16:20.020
So, tube number three which
is supposed to be cut on the nadir side,

16:20.938 --> 16:22.815
<i>has been cut on the zenith side.</i>

16:23.524 --> 16:25.484
<i>I think that’s unrecoverable failure.</i>

16:26.860 --> 16:28.696
That’s bad news, dudes.

16:30.531 --> 16:32.366
This is unrecoverable, right?

16:33.117 --> 16:34.576
That’s just... Those...

16:35.244 --> 16:38.622
That’s it, right?
No... no action required?

16:39.289 --> 16:40.749
Affirm. No action required.

16:52.511 --> 16:54.805
- I got... I don’t know what to say to you.
How was it?

16:54.888 --> 16:56.181
It’s all good, yeah.

17:34.053 --> 17:37.222
<i>I couldn't believe it.
I actually... I was like, "What?"</i>

17:38.807 --> 17:40.642
<i>Sure enough, I cut the wrong tube.</i>

17:42.352 --> 17:43.771
<i>And it was unrecoverable.</i>

17:44.521 --> 17:46.482
<i>If you cut the wrong tube
in the wrong place,</i>

17:46.607 --> 17:52.237
<i>you've effectively lost the ability
to do the repair. So, it's a big deal.</i>

18:00.454 --> 18:06.710
<i>The heart of the fabric of who I am
is someone who doesn't like to disappoint.</i>

18:09.171 --> 18:12.216
It really bothers me
to disappoint those people

18:12.299 --> 18:15.177
that are believing in me
or counting on me.

18:20.015 --> 18:22.810
<i>It’s the same analogy
for when I was in the military.</i>

18:24.394 --> 18:27.856
<i>In times of war, you have
to be completely immersed</i>

18:27.981 --> 18:30.359
<i>in your role with the unit.</i>

18:31.860 --> 18:34.029
Going to funerals of teammates...

18:35.239 --> 18:39.451
really makes you want to just be
as sharp as you can with your job.

18:39.576 --> 18:42.162
<i>We would think about everything,
plan for everything</i>

18:42.287 --> 18:45.040
<i>because your poor decisions
or poor preparation</i>

18:45.124 --> 18:48.585
<i>could impact the mission,
and your teammate’s lives.</i>

18:49.545 --> 18:52.548
That’s true
in the astronaut world as well.

18:55.759 --> 19:00.931
<i>At a certain point it’s time for other
astronauts, for them to have their chance.</i>

19:02.266 --> 19:06.061
<i>You just never want to be that person
that everybody wants to retire.</i>

19:30.961 --> 19:34.506
<i>My team has worked on this project
for four or five years now.</i>

19:35.215 --> 19:38.135
<i>We have built twenty-five plus tools</i>

19:38.218 --> 19:40.762
<i>designed specifically
for the AMS missions.</i>

19:42.181 --> 19:45.559
<i>One of the challenges with this project
is there aren’t handrails</i>

19:45.642 --> 19:47.644
<i>on the outside of AMS
that the crew members can grab onto,</i>

19:47.853 --> 19:49.021
and stabilize themselves.

19:49.271 --> 19:52.024
When you’re turning a wrench,
you don’t want their whole body to turn,

19:52.107 --> 19:54.276
so they need to stabilize
themselves somehow.

19:55.194 --> 19:58.447
So, when we first talked to Chris
at the very beginning of this project,

19:58.530 --> 20:00.365
we said,
"Okay, we think you need handrails."

20:02.659 --> 20:06.330
He said, "If you can get me a handrail
that will install in less than 30 minutes,

20:06.413 --> 20:07.497
"I’ll take it."

20:08.165 --> 20:11.168
I said, "challenge accepted."
And we did it in less than 30 seconds.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.505
And you have a handrail.

20:16.089 --> 20:18.634
I like the handrail a lot.
It makes me happy.

20:21.386 --> 20:22.387
Swages?
Yeah.

20:22.638 --> 20:25.390
Oh, my least favorite tool.

20:28.393 --> 20:32.397
<i>So, swaging, we’ve got
the old system that is currently on orbit</i>

20:32.481 --> 20:34.066
<i>and we need to connect the new system.</i>

20:34.191 --> 20:37.152
<i>So, to do that you have to
connect the old stainless-steel lines</i>

20:37.236 --> 20:38.362
<i>to the new stainless-steel lines.</i>

20:38.445 --> 20:41.240
<i>So, we go in and we cut those lines
and then we’ve gotta connect them.</i>

20:43.408 --> 20:48.497
<i>So, a swage is a way
to crimp onto the old tubes.</i>

20:48.580 --> 20:51.750
<i>So, you crimp on one side on the old tubes
then you bring the new tubes in.</i>

20:53.085 --> 20:58.048
Crimps onto it and creates
a metal-on-metal seal that doesn’t leak.

20:58.632 --> 20:59.633
Fingers crossed.

21:01.134 --> 21:05.055
<i>We’ve been working
with the swage tool for years now</i>

21:06.473 --> 21:08.267
<i>but we haven’t been able
to find the solution.</i>

21:10.227 --> 21:11.895
<i>We always thought that the swaging</i>

21:12.062 --> 21:14.147
<i>was gonna be
the most difficult part of the operation.</i>

21:14.648 --> 21:18.443
<i>It is one of the most frustrating things
I think I’ve ever had to deal with.</i>

21:19.236 --> 21:20.320
<i>This is ARGOS.</i>

21:20.445 --> 21:23.532
<i>It can basically suspend you
as if you’re in microgravity</i>

21:23.615 --> 21:26.576
<i>and we’ve used it a lot for AMS
to improve our techniques</i>

21:26.660 --> 21:28.912
<i>and make sure that they’re going
to work for us in space.</i>

21:29.621 --> 21:32.165
I can’t even get the tube
in the straightener all the way.

21:33.083 --> 21:34.584
Maybe it slipped in there or something?

21:35.335 --> 21:36.920
Yeah...
<i>It’s a lot of pressure.</i>

21:37.045 --> 21:38.130
<i>We're all very stressed.</i>

21:39.381 --> 21:41.008
We weren’t able to get it to work

21:50.017 --> 21:51.518
<i>Chris has done an amazing job.</i>

21:51.601 --> 21:53.770
He’s one of the most capable
astronauts we have.

21:57.816 --> 21:59.484
<i>Some days I feel like
we torture him a bit</i>

21:59.568 --> 22:01.528
<i>because we have him in ARGOS all the time</i>

22:02.029 --> 22:04.740
<i>and we just keep finding
that every time we fix something,</i>

22:04.823 --> 22:06.325
<i>something else runs in.</i>

22:15.292 --> 22:19.379
What iteration are we on? Like if you had
a folder on your computer...

22:19.463 --> 22:20.881
- What does this say?
- We do actually have one.

22:20.964 --> 22:23.050
...like Swage dot 17?

22:23.216 --> 22:25.761
Fix that problem and then
another one crops up,

22:25.844 --> 22:27.346
and we fix that one
and this one crops up.

22:29.931 --> 22:32.809
I can’t reach it right now.

22:35.187 --> 22:38.607
<i>It is the most frustrating thing
I’ve ever had to deal with.</i>

22:39.107 --> 22:41.193
<i>It makes me want to scream.</i>

22:49.034 --> 22:50.827
<i>We have to get this working today.</i>

22:52.037 --> 22:56.166
<i>This time nothing’s going to leak,
we’ve left nothing up to chance.</i>

22:59.169 --> 23:03.256
<i>If the swage doesn't
work this time, we’re out of ideas.</i>

23:03.715 --> 23:04.716
How you doing, Jeremy?

23:04.800 --> 23:06.009
- Great.
- Suit feel okay?

23:06.301 --> 23:08.929
<i>We cannot miss our tool's launch window.</i>

23:10.430 --> 23:14.351
All right, Jeremy you are in microgravity.

23:15.185 --> 23:17.729
<i>Every single piece
has to fall into place.</i>

23:21.817 --> 23:23.902
Okay,
I’m going to go ahead and swage.

23:24.069 --> 23:25.070
Yep.

23:28.073 --> 23:29.908
Go for one.

23:32.702 --> 23:33.954
Go for two.

23:36.123 --> 23:37.499
So far so good.

23:40.544 --> 23:41.711
Go three.

23:49.010 --> 23:53.473
It’s still off. That’s what
I’m telling you is not happening.

23:55.934 --> 23:58.311
<i>It is insanely frustrating.</i>

23:58.395 --> 24:05.318
<i>I’ve done everything you can think of
to get this to do what I need it to do</i>

24:05.444 --> 24:10.866
<i>and something that I can’t name,
is causing it to fail.</i>

24:12.951 --> 24:14.619
<i>Oh, boy, are we running out of time.</i>

24:15.620 --> 24:18.999
<i>How we gonna get this done,
and still have enough runway at the end?</i>

24:19.124 --> 24:22.711
Okay, GCA, I'm gonna GCA,
five degrees, right roll.

24:22.878 --> 24:26.506
<i>My last name is Bollweg,
that sometimes stands for Plan B.</i>

24:29.468 --> 24:33.597
Well. I gotta come up with a Plan B here.

24:33.889 --> 24:34.890
<i>Copy.</i>

24:50.822 --> 24:53.033
<i>Never give up. You just can’t.</i>

24:53.158 --> 24:58.163
<i>Otherwise, the whole mission is not
gonna be successful. Never give up.</i>

25:03.627 --> 25:06.588
<i>If it’s leaking,
I can make it stop leaking.</i>

25:07.130 --> 25:09.382
<i>I’ve been doing it
since I was 11 years old.</i>

25:10.175 --> 25:13.512
This is... You know, I was
brought up as a plumber.

25:16.890 --> 25:21.061
<i>My father was a plumbing, heating,
electrical and drainage contractor.</i>

25:21.144 --> 25:25.315
<i>The business was actually formed by
my grandfather, J.H. Bollweg and Sons</i>

25:25.732 --> 25:27.776
<i>and I started working there
when I was 11 years old.</i>

25:27.859 --> 25:30.028
<i>You know, sweeping the floors,
stocking shelves, you know,</i>

25:30.153 --> 25:32.239
<i>and learned a lot about plumbing.</i>

25:33.156 --> 25:36.117
So, it was that plumbing background
that started in my father’s shop

25:36.660 --> 25:38.078
that led to this.

25:39.996 --> 25:42.832
<i>And now I’m a space plumber.</i>

25:50.549 --> 25:54.261
<i>My entire life
I’ve always had some sorta workshop.</i>

25:54.761 --> 25:58.515
<i>I’m not a whole person
if I don't have a place to work on things.</i>

25:58.890 --> 26:03.770
<i>Alright so the acronym BARF is
the Bollweg Advanced Research Facility.</i>

26:05.105 --> 26:10.193
Well, I did some tests in the
Bollweg low temperature thermal chamber

26:10.610 --> 26:12.862
which of course
is the freezer in the house.

26:12.988 --> 26:15.824
Or I did it in the high temperature
thermal chamber which was our oven.

26:15.907 --> 26:17.158
You know...

26:19.202 --> 26:20.370
So, welcome to the BARF!

26:28.295 --> 26:29.546
<i>Everywhere I’ve ever worked,</i>

26:29.629 --> 26:31.923
<i>I’ve always been pushed into
various management positions</i>

26:33.758 --> 26:35.927
and I’ve hated it. Every time.

26:37.345 --> 26:41.558
<i>I enjoy building things.
That’s my thing. Making things work.</i>

26:43.935 --> 26:47.981
<i>When it became apparent
that this fitting was a problem,</i>

26:48.106 --> 26:50.567
my next trip back here
I brought a bunch of this stuff with me

26:51.234 --> 26:52.569
<i>to make that fitting.</i>

26:53.778 --> 26:58.283
<i>If we do all these spacewalks
and the fitting leaks, what's the point?</i>

27:00.744 --> 27:04.456
<i>It's a passion,
it’s always been like this, I don't know.</i>

27:04.539 --> 27:07.792
<i>I guess a lot like my dad was,
kind of a workaholic.</i>

27:08.376 --> 27:09.794
<i>He worked extra hours as well.</i>

27:10.920 --> 27:15.300
But with seven of us kids
we still all came out okay!

27:23.558 --> 27:26.478
<i>You have to sacrifice a lot
of your personal life to be doing this.</i>

27:26.853 --> 27:28.730
<i>You know,
so it takes a certain personality.</i>

27:29.522 --> 27:33.234
It’s not unusual for me to be at work
all day, come home, we have dinner,

27:33.318 --> 27:35.945
do a couple things, they go
to bed and I go back to work.

27:37.113 --> 27:40.241
<i>You pay for it, it stresses you out,
it ages you.</i>

27:41.534 --> 27:43.495
<i>There's been times
where the sun is coming up...</i>

27:43.578 --> 27:45.538
<i>...and I’m still out here tinkering.</i>

27:59.219 --> 28:01.388
<i>My youngest boy keeps saying
at least once a week,</i>

28:01.471 --> 28:03.306
<i>"You need to retire, you need to retire."</i>

28:03.682 --> 28:08.311
<i>And he might be right,
you know, who knows?</i>

28:33.920 --> 28:38.299
<i>We went to the next stage,
and built our first prototype, in Germany.</i>

28:52.063 --> 28:55.984
<i>Seeing the capability they have there
and having that wonderful machine shop,</i>

28:57.569 --> 29:00.739
I described what I needed and boom!

29:01.322 --> 29:02.407
"Here you go."

29:02.782 --> 29:03.783
Perfect.

29:04.075 --> 29:08.037
<i>So, then we showed the team
the prototype and from that point</i>

29:08.121 --> 29:10.081
<i>we could build a complete set of them.</i>

29:10.457 --> 29:12.625
<i>But you need
to swage 'em and test 'em</i>

29:12.751 --> 29:15.378
<i>to make sure that they’re going
to work okay in the vacuum of space.</i>

29:15.462 --> 29:16.546
Okay?

29:24.137 --> 29:26.681
<i>It wasn't perfectly clear
that these repairs</i>

29:27.515 --> 29:30.769
would be ready to execute this year,
this calendar year.

29:31.019 --> 29:34.773
When they're having serious,
serious problems with the tools,

29:35.273 --> 29:37.942
it doesn't breed a lot of confidence

29:38.443 --> 29:43.740
that you should put
the plan in place to make it happen.

29:56.836 --> 29:58.087
Right.

30:02.217 --> 30:06.763
<i>Late in the game, to completely
change the whole tool process</i>

30:06.971 --> 30:09.140
<i>is a big deal.</i>

30:10.350 --> 30:11.851
Yeah. Tough.

30:14.813 --> 30:16.022
Yaw me around.

30:27.325 --> 30:29.911
All right, I’m ready
for the swage tool, please.

30:33.832 --> 30:34.958
Here we go.

30:42.215 --> 30:43.216
Like butter.

30:46.177 --> 30:48.346
And you see on one, 75 flat.

30:50.014 --> 30:51.641
It's one of them.

30:54.018 --> 30:55.854
And then you close both handles.

31:00.275 --> 31:03.695
To me, that's a game changer
for this. To do it in this way.

31:08.741 --> 31:10.827
- Yeah, I like it!
Good, good.

31:12.704 --> 31:16.499
<i>To have Ken’s swage pass the test
is a huge relief for the whole team.</i>

31:17.083 --> 31:19.794
<i>Now, we can get it
to the cargo ship on time for launch.</i>

31:23.423 --> 31:28.761
<i>Today’s results were great.
We passed leak tests on all eight swages.</i>

31:29.512 --> 31:31.848
<i>It’s exciting news.
Moving in the right direction.</i>

31:43.359 --> 31:46.112
I’m more confident today
than I’ve been in the last four years.

31:46.195 --> 31:47.196
Yeah, me too.

31:47.280 --> 31:49.198
It’s nice to be one step closer.

31:49.741 --> 31:51.117
I think it’s gonna be really good.

31:55.038 --> 31:56.414
The hardware’s ready to go.

31:57.540 --> 31:59.334
You know,
you figure all these things out

31:59.417 --> 32:01.294
and then by the time you get to the end,

32:01.377 --> 32:04.255
hopefully you got a good spacecraft,
a good piece of hardware,

32:04.547 --> 32:07.759
- in this case, a good set of EVAs.
- Yeah, here’s hoping.

32:08.843 --> 32:10.053
It’s gonna be awesome.

32:20.647 --> 32:22.732
Never quite sure how I like my hairnet.

32:23.274 --> 32:24.776
Yeah.

32:24.901 --> 32:27.487
<i>The team is looking
at all these pieces of equipment</i>

32:27.570 --> 32:31.032
<i>before it gets loaded up in the bags
for final loading into the spacecraft.</i>

32:31.157 --> 32:34.369
<i>So, this is the last time
people on earth will see this equipment.</i>

32:34.661 --> 32:36.204
Next time will be on board the station.

32:37.705 --> 32:42.335
We get that line. So, since there is
pressure inside, this will pop open.

32:43.044 --> 32:47.298
So, when you do the leak check,
see how it’s pushed in just a little bit?

32:47.423 --> 32:48.675
That’s what you’re going to see.

32:48.841 --> 32:50.426
That indicates that there is no leak.

32:50.551 --> 32:54.681
If they see any red,
if it’s a small leak it'll look like that.

32:54.764 --> 32:56.599
If it’s a big leak,
it'll look like that then.

32:56.933 --> 33:00.728
So, if you tighten it, come back
in an hour, then you should see that.

33:01.354 --> 33:04.983
Which is nothing. If you see that again,
that’s a really bad day.

33:11.823 --> 33:14.158
Getting the cover off, I think
the next most important critical thing

33:14.242 --> 33:17.829
would be
making the EVA connections for the tubes.

33:20.373 --> 33:23.292
Many times. Both in the NBL and ARGOS.

33:29.716 --> 33:34.846
No. And what concerns us is that the last
time they saw this was on May 31st.

33:35.388 --> 33:36.681
- Yeah.
- Next time they'll see it,

33:36.806 --> 33:37.849
will be on orbit.

33:38.224 --> 33:40.727
So, that’s why
we’re very concerned about this.

33:43.896 --> 33:48.276
<i>It’s done. The what-ifs,
the what if we... All done.</i>

33:48.693 --> 33:51.279
<i>The team is happy, the team is motivated,</i>

33:51.446 --> 33:57.118
and really anxious to see a rocket lift
off the planet with their equipment in it

33:57.326 --> 34:01.039
<i>and knowing that it’s on its way
to the final step which is the repair.</i>

34:21.100 --> 34:23.644
<i>It's a great honor
for me to introduce our next speaker,</i>

34:23.770 --> 34:27.315
Professor Samuel Ting is the creator
and the principal investigator

34:27.398 --> 34:30.109
of the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer
on the ISS.

34:30.860 --> 34:33.988
The AMS results over
its eight year period in space

34:34.072 --> 34:36.115
have changed
our understanding of the cosmos,

34:36.240 --> 34:39.660
and they continue to do so, to this day.
Professor Ting...

35:42.974 --> 35:44.058
Hey, here we go.

35:59.782 --> 36:02.493
Pretty excited.
The kickoff was four years ago,

36:02.577 --> 36:04.245
this is... now we’re on the goal line.

36:06.038 --> 36:07.957
<i>I’m not in charge
of any of this right now.</i>

36:09.208 --> 36:11.961
<i>Everything else that’s on it, I’ve been
in charge of for the last four years,</i>

36:12.044 --> 36:15.173
<i>so of course, I’m very worried about that.
I want to see this thing get off.</i>

36:17.258 --> 36:19.302
<i>This has been
a real constant in my life.</i>

36:19.468 --> 36:23.556
AMS started in ‘94,
so I was eight years old.

36:23.681 --> 36:27.977
So, really the project is like my...
little brother in space.

36:47.830 --> 36:48.831
Five minutes.

36:49.790 --> 36:51.125
- Five?
- Yep.

36:53.419 --> 36:57.048
My worst nightmare is to see
the thing somehow fail on the pad,

36:57.131 --> 36:59.884
destroy the hardware and,
"Oh, my gosh, we gotta go do this again?"

37:00.593 --> 37:02.678
Sam, I'm not sure if we actually got all
the hardware on there...

37:05.014 --> 37:08.267
- Did you double check everything?
- Yeah, I’ll be back in a minute...

37:11.771 --> 37:14.440
<i>T-minus 30 seconds.</i>
Good to go.

37:15.316 --> 37:16.692
Let’s just get this off.

37:23.741 --> 37:24.825
<i>T-minus ten.</i>

37:29.747 --> 37:34.043
<i>Five, four, three, two, one.</i>
One!

37:36.087 --> 37:37.171
Come on, baby...

37:39.382 --> 37:41.092
Here it is, there it is. Here we go!

37:52.311 --> 37:55.314
- Look at it! Look!
- Go, baby, go. Go.

38:08.911 --> 38:09.996
We’re on our way.

38:21.382 --> 38:22.383
Wow.

38:27.054 --> 38:28.389
Now, we can go to work.

38:28.639 --> 38:29.932
It's a great achievement.

38:31.600 --> 38:33.102
- I know!
Everything you did.

38:34.562 --> 38:37.064
- Thank you!
- Nope! We’ve got more to do,

38:37.148 --> 38:39.900
- now we’ve got a couple spacewalks to do.
- Yes, yes. Yes, yes, that's right.

38:40.067 --> 38:41.360
Fire it up.

38:45.281 --> 38:47.783
<i>The science it’s doing,
the research we’re doing,</i>

38:47.950 --> 38:51.579
<i>the ways we can learn
to go to Mars, to go to the Moon,</i>

38:51.787 --> 38:54.540
<i>to go to other galaxies eventually.</i>

38:55.458 --> 38:57.043
<i>This is the foundation of it.</i>
