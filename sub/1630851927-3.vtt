- First one today, aren't you?

03:36.871 --> 03:37.872
- Nope.

03:40.185 --> 03:41.497
- No?

03:41.531 --> 03:43.671
- Getting to the barn first
is no easy trick.

03:43.706 --> 03:46.018
- I'd set that alarm back
a half hour to be sure.

03:59.273 --> 04:00.309
- Morning.

04:02.897 --> 04:06.729
- Starting to think you lost
faith in my riding skills.

04:06.763 --> 04:08.351
- I lost faith in damn near
everything else,

04:08.386 --> 04:09.732
but not your riding.

04:09.766 --> 04:12.390
Ain't that.
- No?

04:12.424 --> 04:15.358
- Just don't know how many more
times we'll get to do this.

04:18.706 --> 04:19.983
- Me neither, son.

04:20.018 --> 04:21.261
Me neither.

04:37.794 --> 04:39.934
- We'll head up the East Canyon
check them pastures,

04:39.969 --> 04:41.557
and just doctor
down into the valley.

04:43.075 --> 04:45.975
- Just don't seem right after
what he's been through.

04:47.873 --> 04:49.599
- Lloyd, he needs to grow up.

04:49.634 --> 04:51.601
He ain't been doing that here.

04:51.636 --> 04:54.708
- He wears the brand.
This is his home.

04:54.742 --> 04:56.675
- Not anymore it ain't.

04:56.710 --> 04:57.711
Not for a while.

05:01.749 --> 05:03.337
Where's Walker at, Lloyd?

05:04.649 --> 05:06.789
- Sleeping in that barrel
racer's trailer...

05:09.274 --> 05:11.759
I sure don't know how much
more my pride can take

05:11.794 --> 05:14.210
of that little son of a bitch.

05:14.244 --> 05:15.901
Jimmy's kicked out
of the bunkhouse

05:15.936 --> 05:17.455
but these girls--

05:17.489 --> 05:20.492
- Lloyd, get your fucking
head right.

05:20.527 --> 05:22.529
And you leave your pride right
here in this bunkhouse.

05:27.050 --> 05:28.328
Let's go to work.

05:42.065 --> 05:44.861
Why are you sleeping
in a trailer, Walker?

05:44.896 --> 05:47.070
- So that old fart
don't stab me in my sleep.

05:49.866 --> 05:51.316
- What's the job today?

05:51.351 --> 05:53.663
- Go on and start saddling
horses then drag the arena.

05:53.698 --> 05:54.802
Travis will be here in a bit.

06:05.261 --> 06:07.884
- Weren't my idea to invite
a bunch of barrel racers

06:07.919 --> 06:09.921
to live here.

06:09.955 --> 06:11.647
- You got no problem riding
them, though, do ya?

06:13.580 --> 06:16.514
- Hell, I was in prison
for seven years.

06:16.548 --> 06:20.000
You're lucky I don't drill
a hole in the side of that barn

06:20.034 --> 06:21.898
and take it
for a ride too.

06:27.283 --> 06:28.905
- Did he say which ranch?

06:30.148 --> 06:31.494
- Just said Texas.

06:32.530 --> 06:33.703
- Texas?

06:33.738 --> 06:34.877
- Yeah, I know.

06:35.947 --> 06:37.189
- You ever been?

06:38.846 --> 06:40.469
Then you don't know.

06:40.503 --> 06:42.471
Everything in that place
is trying to bite you,

06:42.505 --> 06:44.093
stick you, or sting you.

06:44.127 --> 06:45.577
It's a hundred and ten
in the fucking shade.

06:45.612 --> 06:46.854
- Yeah, well,
I didn't choose it.

06:51.376 --> 06:52.929
Look, I don't have anything.

06:55.138 --> 06:57.382
I don't have a family,
I don't have anyone.

06:58.763 --> 07:01.421
This is my family.

07:01.455 --> 07:03.388
This is all I have,
so I didn't...

07:03.423 --> 07:04.872
I didn't have a fucking choice.

07:06.564 --> 07:10.119
- Which one of those wranglers
sat with you every day,

07:10.153 --> 07:12.259
all day, all night,

07:12.293 --> 07:14.537
fed you, dressed you?

07:14.572 --> 07:16.297
And you have the nerve
to look me in the eye

07:16.332 --> 07:17.816
and say that
you don't have anyone, Jimmy?

07:17.851 --> 07:19.335
- That's not what I meant.

07:19.369 --> 07:20.474
- You could've chosen me.

07:20.509 --> 07:23.373
You could've chosen me.
But you didn't.

07:23.408 --> 07:26.204
So, you're right,
you're all out of choices,
- Don't--

07:26.238 --> 07:28.758
- because your only other
choice is fucking done with you.

07:30.726 --> 07:32.106
- Mia.

07:57.235 --> 07:59.409
- Son of a bitch.

07:59.444 --> 08:00.480
Hey.

08:00.514 --> 08:01.481
Boy, come here.

08:04.725 --> 08:06.658
Did you put that saddle
on this horse?

08:06.693 --> 08:07.832
- Uh, yep.

08:09.247 --> 08:10.973
- What's wrong
with this picture?

08:11.007 --> 08:12.630
- Don't really know the picture.

08:12.664 --> 08:14.494
I just winged it.

08:14.528 --> 08:17.427
- Right, if you don't know how
to do something, don't do it.

08:17.462 --> 08:20.534
Cause it's gonna get you hurt
or even worse on this ranch.

08:20.569 --> 08:21.535
You understand me?

08:21.570 --> 08:22.985
- Gotcha.
- No, hey, hey.

08:23.019 --> 08:25.505
It ain't "gotcha."
It's "Yes, sir."

08:25.539 --> 08:26.816
Learn some fucking manners.

08:28.784 --> 08:29.750
- Yes, sir.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.139
- All right, let's go.

08:40.796 --> 08:43.384
- Hey, Kiddo.
What's your name?

08:43.419 --> 08:45.870
- Everyone's just
been calling me "boy."

08:45.904 --> 08:47.388
- So you want
to be a cowboy, huh?

08:47.423 --> 08:49.770
- Life kinda robbed
me of my options.

08:49.805 --> 08:52.221
- Well, that's how
it usually starts.

09:26.842 --> 09:28.740
- Why does he get
the roast beef?

09:28.775 --> 09:30.052
- 'Cause there's
only enough for one

09:30.086 --> 09:32.744
and he won't eat peanut butter.

09:32.779 --> 09:34.608
- Boy's not hungry enough.

09:44.825 --> 09:45.792
- Home late?

09:45.826 --> 09:46.931
- Don't know.

09:46.965 --> 09:48.864
- Be safe.

09:48.898 --> 09:49.865
- Love you.

10:18.963 --> 10:20.447
- Eat fast.

10:20.481 --> 10:21.759
- Why?

10:22.932 --> 10:24.002
Where are you taking me?

10:26.246 --> 10:28.110
Hey. Where are you taking me?

10:29.974 --> 10:33.287
Where are you taking me!

10:49.683 --> 10:51.892
- Emmett Walsh
is in your office.

10:51.927 --> 10:53.273
- Thank you.

10:55.965 --> 10:57.726
- Emmett.
- Kayce.

10:58.934 --> 11:01.591
- Have a seat.
- Naw, I'm all right.

11:02.592 --> 11:04.318
How's your father doing?

11:04.353 --> 11:08.391
- He's about through it,
I guess.

11:08.426 --> 11:10.877
- That tough old bastard's
hard to kill, isn't he?

11:10.911 --> 11:12.326
You too, I guess.

11:12.361 --> 11:14.501
- Yeah, we're just stubborn
that way.

11:14.535 --> 11:16.503
- Kayce, I, uh...

11:16.537 --> 11:18.539
I know you're up
to your neck in shit

11:18.574 --> 11:20.265
and I don't
mean to add on to it, but...

11:21.991 --> 11:24.028
I've tried being nice,
I've tried lawyers.

11:24.062 --> 11:26.064
I've tried just about everything
I can think of.

11:26.099 --> 11:28.101
- What's the problem?

11:28.135 --> 11:30.966
- This son of a bitch
from Cali-fucking-fornia,

11:31.000 --> 11:33.209
bought property
across from mine.

11:33.244 --> 11:35.591
My easement goes
through his land.

11:35.625 --> 11:37.800
I push my cattle
up to that easement

11:37.835 --> 11:39.284
to get them
to summer pastures

11:39.319 --> 11:42.805
and this fucker,
pardon my French.

11:42.840 --> 11:44.842
- You've been speaking French
since you got here, Emmett.

11:44.876 --> 11:46.326
What'd he do, put up a fence?

11:46.360 --> 11:49.087
- Fuck no. Cattle guards all
up and down the road.

11:49.122 --> 11:51.918
Now I have to truck
in and out.

11:51.952 --> 11:54.196
And with the price of cattle,
you know what that means.

11:54.230 --> 11:55.197
- Yeah, what do the lawyers say?

11:55.231 --> 11:57.199
- The lawyers? Oh, shit.

11:57.233 --> 12:00.927
Back and forth for months.
You know, lawyers.

12:00.961 --> 12:03.239
The trucking fees are
eating me alive, Kayce.

12:04.724 --> 12:06.173
- What do you want me to do
about it?

12:06.208 --> 12:08.728
- I don't know...
I don't know, something.

12:12.559 --> 12:13.733
Get your damn greens.

12:13.767 --> 12:15.286
You want to go
look at some shit?

12:15.320 --> 12:16.597
- Hell yeah.

12:18.392 --> 12:21.188
- What did this
fucking thing cost?

12:21.223 --> 12:22.638
- That is sexy.

12:22.672 --> 12:25.537
- No. That's sexy.

12:26.953 --> 12:30.439
- What did them
fucking things cost?

12:30.473 --> 12:33.649
- Well...
more than the truck.

13:53.315 --> 13:54.799
Goddamn.

13:58.872 --> 14:01.150
- Just once I'd like to
ride a horse like that.

14:01.185 --> 14:02.600
- If you tried to stop
a horse like that

14:02.634 --> 14:04.809
it would lawn-dart you
into the cattle trough.

14:04.844 --> 14:07.018
- What? No. Have you trotted
a horse past a mirror lately?

14:07.053 --> 14:09.572
'Cause you look like a drunk
cat trying to fuck a football.

14:09.607 --> 14:11.505

What are you talking about?

14:11.540 --> 14:13.300
That's what
a lawn dart looks like.

14:14.543 --> 14:15.993
I think I'm done
doing that.

14:18.443 --> 14:20.031
- Mia, can I talk to you
for a minute please?

14:21.930 --> 14:23.000
Please.

14:25.830 --> 14:27.142
- Hard to believe you
can sell one of those

14:27.176 --> 14:29.075
and buy a brand new truck.

14:29.109 --> 14:31.077
- You can sell one
of those and buy a house.

15:10.599 --> 15:12.912
- I know what you're thinking.

15:12.946 --> 15:15.293
That it's cruel, what I'm doing,
sending you away.

15:15.328 --> 15:17.986
That it isn't fair.

15:18.020 --> 15:19.711
- Yeah, not much in my life
is fair.

15:22.714 --> 15:24.371
- This isn't
a punishment, Jimmy.

15:24.406 --> 15:26.166
It's an opportunity
if you'll let it be.

15:28.582 --> 15:32.034
- It's costing me the only
person who ever loved me

15:32.069 --> 15:33.725
in my whole fucking life.

15:35.279 --> 15:37.419

for a while makes her leave,

15:37.453 --> 15:39.490
you never had her, son.

15:39.524 --> 15:41.250
Love doesn't walk that easy.

15:42.838 --> 15:45.599
If she really loves you, she'll
be right here when you get back.

15:48.809 --> 15:50.846
- When is that exactly?

15:51.847 --> 15:52.848
- When you're ready.

15:56.231 --> 15:57.473
- Who decides when I'm ready?

15:59.061 --> 16:00.269
- You do.

16:01.788 --> 16:05.826
While you're down there,
you represent this ranch.

16:05.861 --> 16:07.932
You represent my brand.

Yeah.

See you around, Jimmy.

16:41.483 --> 16:42.725
- See you around.

16:56.222 --> 16:58.120
- Spinning son of a bitch.

16:58.155 --> 16:59.708
- Yee-fucking-haw.

16:59.742 --> 17:02.228
- That's the different between
5000 and 300,000 right there.

17:02.262 --> 17:03.884
- Travis...

17:03.919 --> 17:06.025
Let me run and stop just once.

17:06.059 --> 17:08.234
- You bet... for
three hundred thousand dollars.

17:08.268 --> 17:10.408
- Come on, just once.
-

17:10.443 --> 17:12.859
This is a "you break it
you buy it" kind of situation

17:12.893 --> 17:15.310
here, brother,
and you can't afford to buy it.

17:15.344 --> 17:17.829
Nope, only race car drivers
on the race cars.

17:17.864 --> 17:18.830
Is the gimp all packed up?

17:18.865 --> 17:19.831
- The gimp?

17:19.866 --> 17:21.385
- Jerry.
- No, Jimmy.

17:21.419 --> 17:22.731
- Jimmy.

17:22.765 --> 17:24.284
- Yeah, Jimmy's gonna be
ready to go.

17:24.319 --> 17:26.321
- We'll get out of here
around sundown.

17:26.355 --> 17:27.943
- You going with them?

17:27.977 --> 17:29.910
- Yes, sir, right as soon as
Ethan and I get the rest

17:29.945 --> 17:31.015
of these colts finished.

17:31.050 --> 17:32.534
- Where's the first stop?

17:32.568 --> 17:33.983
- Well, we gotta go
to Scottsdale.

17:34.018 --> 17:36.400
Then we got to swing off
into Vegas, meet the cutters.

17:36.434 --> 17:38.781
- You lucky son of a bitch.
- Lucky son of a bitch.

17:38.816 --> 17:40.231
- Then we gotta go
to Fort Worth.

17:40.266 --> 17:42.061
- Fuck, that's the fucking
stockyards, man.

17:42.095 --> 17:43.441
That's my stomping grounds.

17:43.476 --> 17:46.306
- Then we drop dipshit
off at the Four Sixes.

17:46.341 --> 17:47.273
- Oh, shit.

17:47.307 --> 17:48.826
- He's going to the Four Sixes?

17:48.860 --> 17:50.724
- Yeah, yeah.

17:50.759 --> 17:52.174
- Wow.

17:53.796 --> 17:56.765
- He won't last a week.
- Unbelievable.

18:09.295 --> 18:13.506
- You look like a kid in the toy
store who forgot his allowance.

18:13.540 --> 18:15.715
- Darling, those are some of
the finest horses in the world

18:15.749 --> 18:16.888
right there in front of us.

18:20.685 --> 18:24.413
- That's my inheritance running
around in circles.

18:24.448 --> 18:26.691
Glad someone's enjoying it.

18:26.726 --> 18:28.797
- Your inheritance ain't
going nowhere. Believe me.

18:32.180 --> 18:33.974
- Hey, Carter's done
for the day.

18:35.355 --> 18:37.323
- No, not even close.

18:39.221 --> 18:41.223
- It wasn't a question.

18:41.258 --> 18:44.330
I'm taking him shopping.
He's done.

18:44.364 --> 18:47.402
- Beth, please do not
spoil that fucking boy.

18:47.436 --> 18:49.024
He needs to learn
to work right now,

18:49.058 --> 18:50.439
he doesn't need anything else.

18:50.474 --> 18:53.132
- He doesn't have shit.
- He's got this place.

18:53.166 --> 18:54.926
And right now that's as
good as it's going to get.

18:56.928 --> 18:58.344
- Look, I'm going to
take him to Murdoch's.

18:58.378 --> 19:00.587
I'm going to get him a pair
of boots and a decent jacket.

19:00.622 --> 19:01.795
Like, that's it.

19:01.830 --> 19:04.039
- It's up to you.
He's your pet.

19:06.869 --> 19:08.630
- What did you call him?

19:08.664 --> 19:10.908
- Trust me with this boy.

19:10.942 --> 19:12.081
You treat him like a pet

19:12.116 --> 19:13.807
and that's what
you're going to get...

19:13.842 --> 19:16.016
a pet.
And a not a good one.

19:16.051 --> 19:18.122
- Fuck you.
- All right.

19:21.746 --> 19:23.990
- I love you.
I'll see you at the house.

19:25.094 --> 19:26.441
But fuck you.

19:26.475 --> 19:27.476
- All right, baby.

19:29.340 --> 19:31.031
- Hey, let's go.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.483
Let's go.

19:52.708 --> 19:53.675
<i>Can I help you?</i>

19:55.159 --> 19:56.747
- I'm the Livestock
Commissioner.

19:56.781 --> 19:58.266
I need to speak
with Ralph Peterson.

19:58.300 --> 20:00.406
<i>- You need to
make an appointment.</i>

20:00.440 --> 20:01.786
- No, I don't.

20:01.821 --> 20:03.374
<i>- Leave or I'm calling
the police.</i>

20:03.409 --> 20:05.307
- I am the police.
Now open the gate.

20:05.342 --> 20:07.551
<i>- I'm calling my lawyer.</i>

20:07.585 --> 20:08.828
- Fuck this.

20:32.817 --> 20:34.716
- Now I'm on with the police
so you go ahead

20:34.750 --> 20:35.717
and stay right where you are.

20:46.521 --> 20:49.489
- This is Livestock
Commissioner Dutton.

20:49.524 --> 20:52.251
I've got a Mr. Peterson in
my custody for refusing entry.

20:52.285 --> 20:53.286
- You don't have a warrant!

20:53.321 --> 20:55.392
- I don't need
a fucking warrant.

20:55.426 --> 20:58.291
No... If I charge him,
I'll bring him in.

21:02.295 --> 21:03.745
- You arresting me?

21:03.779 --> 21:05.264
- I want to see these
cattle guards.

21:48.617 --> 21:50.550
- Strange place for a meeting.

21:50.585 --> 21:52.311
- It's necessary.

21:52.345 --> 21:54.209
You'll understand why
when I tell you.

21:55.728 --> 21:57.695
- Tell me what?

21:57.730 --> 21:59.732
- Who ordered the attack on you.

21:59.766 --> 22:00.836
And your family.

22:02.597 --> 22:04.046
- You know?

22:05.082 --> 22:06.186
- We know.

22:07.912 --> 22:09.466
- How do you know?

22:09.500 --> 22:13.021
- I can show you
or you can trust me.

22:13.055 --> 22:16.680
But if I show you,
it's your trash to take out.

22:17.853 --> 22:20.339
We still have chess to play,
you and me,

22:20.373 --> 22:22.893
and I refuse to
surrender my queen.

22:22.927 --> 22:23.928
- Yeah.

22:26.552 --> 22:27.967
- Who's this?

22:28.001 --> 22:29.796
- The man who wanted you dead.

22:31.695 --> 22:33.144
- I don't know this man.

22:33.179 --> 22:34.732
- He knows you.

22:34.767 --> 22:36.769
- Where is this man right now?

22:36.803 --> 22:38.978
- State prison in Deer Lodge.

22:40.566 --> 22:42.706
- I'm not in
a very trusting mood, Tom.

22:42.740 --> 22:44.224
I think you need to show me.

22:44.259 --> 22:48.194
- Then it becomes your trash.
And you have to take it out.

22:48.228 --> 22:51.231
- Just fucking show me.

22:51.266 --> 22:53.302
- I'm truly sorry for
what happened to you, John.

22:54.787 --> 22:57.168
I hope this helps you
get to the bottom of it.

23:16.947 --> 23:18.293
- The suspense
is killing me, Mo.

23:18.327 --> 23:20.778
It's just...
Fucking killing me.

23:20.813 --> 23:22.711
- I want to watch him
reach the pavement.

23:25.680 --> 23:28.303
You know, I've got better
things to do with my day.

23:28.337 --> 23:29.753
- This is worth the wait, John.

23:44.975 --> 23:46.494
- This him?

23:46.528 --> 23:48.357
- This is who he used
to put it together.

24:01.198 --> 24:03.372
- I don't know who
any of these fuckers are.

24:03.407 --> 24:04.822
Who are you?

24:06.375 --> 24:07.791
Who is this?

24:07.825 --> 24:09.931
- His cell mate from way back.

24:09.965 --> 24:12.002
- The hit comes to him

24:12.036 --> 24:16.351
and then I put
people together on the outside.

24:16.385 --> 24:20.044
That's all I do.
I just put people together.

24:21.563 --> 24:24.117
- So you went to the militia.

24:24.152 --> 24:26.637
- Yes, sir, I did.
I went to the militia.

24:26.672 --> 24:29.468
The same one that you burned.

24:29.502 --> 24:31.366
That's all I did.

24:31.400 --> 24:33.506
I got nothing to do with
what they did to you.

24:33.541 --> 24:35.059
- Who gives the order to him?

24:41.065 --> 24:42.481
I'm keeping this.

24:43.585 --> 24:44.655
- It's yours to keep.

24:46.864 --> 24:48.141
- You can go now, Mo.

25:09.680 --> 25:11.302
- Now, why'd you do that?

25:11.337 --> 25:13.477
- All spring he's
marching cattle up this road,

25:13.512 --> 25:14.478
shitting everywhere.

25:14.513 --> 25:16.135
- Your cattle don't shit?

25:16.169 --> 25:17.723
- I don't have cattle.

25:17.757 --> 25:19.725
Raising something to eat
is fucking barbaric.

25:19.759 --> 25:21.002
- You're claiming
an ag-exemption, aren't you?

25:21.036 --> 25:21.968
So what are you raising?

25:22.003 --> 25:23.176
- Llamas.

25:23.211 --> 25:25.489
- Llamas.
What do you do with llamas?

25:25.524 --> 25:27.387
- I don't do anything with them,
but get the tax break.

25:27.422 --> 25:28.457
- Of course you do.

25:28.492 --> 25:29.458
That right there is wrong.

25:29.493 --> 25:31.495
That violates his easement

25:31.530 --> 25:33.186
and he has to spend money
he doesn't have

25:33.221 --> 25:35.534
to load cattle in trucks
because you don't like cattle.

25:35.568 --> 25:37.052
- I don't have anything
against cattle.

25:37.087 --> 25:38.295
I just don't want
them on my fucking road.

25:38.329 --> 25:39.365
- That is not your choice.

25:39.399 --> 25:41.954
- This land is mine.
It's mine!

25:41.988 --> 25:43.472
You can't tell me what
to do on it.

25:43.507 --> 25:44.715
- You know what I can do?

25:44.750 --> 25:46.303
I can make a good
neighbor out of you.

26:03.009 --> 26:04.839
- I'll just put in another one,
you know.

26:06.116 --> 26:08.705
And another one.
And another one.

26:08.739 --> 26:11.397
It'll be cattle guards
to the fucking interstate.

26:21.994 --> 26:23.271
Oh, whoa!

26:25.376 --> 26:27.068
Are you fucking crazy?

26:27.102 --> 26:28.656
You can't put me in here!

26:28.690 --> 26:30.519
Come back!

26:31.348 --> 26:33.592
Stop! No, no, no!

26:43.015 --> 26:44.016
Are you crazy?

26:46.018 --> 26:48.089
- You like your cattle guard
so much,

26:48.123 --> 26:49.677
why don't you
fucking live in them.

26:49.711 --> 26:53.612
- Come back here, you crazy--
You can't leave me here.

26:53.646 --> 26:56.511
Your grandchildren will have
a lawsuit to pay off.

26:56.545 --> 26:59.445
You get me outta here!
Goddamn it!

27:15.288 --> 27:17.325
- Hey. Put your seatbelt on.

27:17.359 --> 27:20.708
<i>Thanksgiving is now earlier this year...</i>

27:20.742 --> 27:22.606
Thank you.

27:22.641 --> 27:23.642
<i>And this is where they're
going to get off.</i>

27:23.676 --> 27:25.402
<i>for the fourth quarter.</i>

27:25.436 --> 27:28.163
<i>But it could be challenging
to unload</i>

27:28.198 --> 27:31.339
<i>The surge in what we're
seeing right now,
especially when Covid--</i>

27:36.344 --> 27:39.243
<i>♪ About her</i>

27:39.278 --> 27:41.314
<i>♪ She's the prettiest flower</i>

27:41.349 --> 27:42.799
- This has a massager?

27:42.833 --> 27:44.283
- Yup.

27:47.873 --> 27:49.633
Shit.

27:49.668 --> 27:51.014
- All right, that's enough.

27:51.048 --> 27:52.463
Just...

27:52.498 --> 27:54.707
- I can get anything I want?
Really?

27:54.742 --> 27:55.984
- Not anything.

27:56.019 --> 27:59.401
You get a pair of boots,
a decent jacket, and a hat.

27:59.436 --> 28:01.749
- Don't like wearing hats.

28:01.783 --> 28:04.234
- Then you picked
the wrong line of work, buddy.

28:04.268 --> 28:05.511
- Jeans?

28:05.545 --> 28:08.169
- Yeah, you can get
a pair of jeans. Not them.

28:08.203 --> 28:09.653
These.

28:09.688 --> 28:12.138
- Oh, shit, look at this!

28:13.830 --> 28:15.935
- Uh, yeah, no.

28:33.159 --> 28:35.403
- I mean...
We gotta, right?

28:37.577 --> 28:39.856
- Okay, let's go.

28:39.890 --> 28:40.857
- Where we going?

28:42.030 --> 28:44.308
- Take the shirt off.

28:44.343 --> 28:46.069
- You said I could have it.

28:46.103 --> 28:50.038
- No, I said you
could get a pair of boots.

28:50.073 --> 28:51.591
- I want this instead of boots.

28:56.976 --> 28:58.875
- Take the fucking shirt off.
- No.

28:58.909 --> 29:00.359
- That's child abuse.

29:00.393 --> 29:02.671
- Excuse me?

29:02.706 --> 29:04.570
It's not child abuse.
He's taking off
the fucking shirt.

29:04.604 --> 29:05.951
- She's making me.
I don't want to.

29:05.985 --> 29:07.815
- I'm calling the police.
That's child abuse.

29:07.849 --> 29:10.300
- That wasn't child abuse.

29:10.334 --> 29:11.784
This is fucking child abuse.

29:11.819 --> 29:13.406
- What the fuck?

29:22.761 --> 29:24.797
- That is destruction
of personal property.

29:24.832 --> 29:26.937
Assault is next.
You ready to see that?

29:26.972 --> 29:28.214
- I don't want any trouble.

29:30.527 --> 29:32.632
- Lady, you crave trouble,

29:32.667 --> 29:34.807
you just don't want resistance.

29:34.842 --> 29:36.878
And if you don't want
resistance around here

29:36.913 --> 29:38.397
you just mind
your own business.

29:40.399 --> 29:42.366
- You have no idea
how to parent a child.

29:46.474 --> 29:47.889
Well, ain't that the truth?

29:53.377 --> 29:54.689
You think you can do better?

29:57.519 --> 29:58.589
He's all yours.

30:13.328 --> 30:14.605
- What did I do wrong?

30:19.058 --> 30:20.611
- You know what you did wrong.

30:22.027 --> 30:24.270
- I tried to get more
than we bargained for.

30:24.305 --> 30:25.858
I'm sorry. Jesus.

30:25.893 --> 30:28.827
- We didn't have a bargain, kid.
Okay? It was a gift.

30:30.000 --> 30:31.105
- I'm sorry.

30:35.316 --> 30:36.489
- Well, get in.

30:44.670 --> 30:47.604
Look, I'm going
to tell you something.

30:47.638 --> 30:50.745
It is a universal truth.

30:50.779 --> 30:54.507
Doesn't matter
where you live, man or woman,

30:54.542 --> 30:57.959
it's as true today as it was
a thousand fucking years ago...

31:01.445 --> 31:02.446
Do you want nice things?

31:04.138 --> 31:05.725
You want the best?

31:05.760 --> 31:08.590
There's only four ways
to get rich, kid.

31:08.625 --> 31:11.076
Four.
That's it.

31:11.110 --> 31:13.837
inherit it.

31:13.872 --> 31:15.390
That ain't happening for you.

31:16.460 --> 31:19.015
you steal it.

31:20.568 --> 31:24.779
You do not have, my friend,
the patience, the power

31:24.813 --> 31:26.643
or quite honestly the intellect

31:26.677 --> 31:29.266
to steal anything of
substance and keep it, so...

31:29.301 --> 31:33.788
work really,
really fucking hard.

31:35.100 --> 31:36.722
Okay?

31:36.756 --> 31:38.068
You learn.

31:40.312 --> 31:41.865
You fail.

31:41.900 --> 31:43.798
Learn more.
Fail more.

31:45.765 --> 31:49.769
And don't let anyone
outwork you.

31:51.047 --> 31:52.186
Ever.

31:55.085 --> 31:56.190
- What's option four?

31:58.295 --> 32:00.849
- Learn how to suck a dick like
you lost your car keys in it.

32:05.337 --> 32:06.476
- Is that how you got rich?

32:12.171 --> 32:13.310
- All right.

32:24.597 --> 32:26.323
- Help me!

32:26.358 --> 32:28.256
Please!

32:28.291 --> 32:31.708
Please, help me!

32:31.742 --> 32:33.399
Help me, please!

32:34.504 --> 32:36.023
Help me, please.

32:39.026 --> 32:40.475
Help.

32:40.510 --> 32:41.856
Oh...

32:57.458 --> 32:58.873
- Everybody ate?

33:01.082 --> 33:02.187
- You're the first one here.

33:04.637 --> 33:06.570
- Monica and Tate
didn't come down?

33:11.541 --> 33:13.715
You, um...

33:13.750 --> 33:16.270
make them a couple of plates?

33:16.304 --> 33:17.443
- Yeah, sure.

33:43.228 --> 33:46.127
- Where you're heading are some
of the best cowboys on earth.

33:48.095 --> 33:50.373
No egos.

33:50.407 --> 33:51.960
None of this bullshit.

33:53.514 --> 33:56.655
No fighting for your life
or your land.

33:56.689 --> 33:58.933
It's just cattle ranches
to the horizon

33:58.967 --> 34:01.487
in every direction.

34:01.522 --> 34:03.938
It's like God just froze
everything in this one place,

34:04.973 --> 34:06.251
and just let it be.

34:08.563 --> 34:10.048
I can imagine it's gonna
be a bit tough for you

34:10.082 --> 34:11.463
to come back here.

34:13.292 --> 34:14.673
If I were you, I wouldn't.

34:16.502 --> 34:18.194
Biggest regret of my
life is leaving

34:18.228 --> 34:19.264
the place you're going to.

34:23.095 --> 34:24.269
Adios, amigo.

34:26.236 --> 34:28.066
I'd brush up on that Spanish.

34:30.309 --> 34:31.276
You might need it.

34:35.866 --> 34:37.903
- All right, Jerry, let's go.
- Jimmy.

34:37.937 --> 34:39.215
- Whatever.
Just get in the fucking truck.

34:48.983 --> 34:51.296
Whoa, hey, wait, what the fuck
are you doing, man?

34:51.330 --> 34:52.883
You can't get in here
with that shit on.

34:52.918 --> 34:55.058
These are
Cayman Alligator seats.

34:55.093 --> 34:57.095
Put all that shit in the back.
Goddamn, dude.

34:58.268 --> 34:59.959
Can you fucking
believe this guy?

35:02.030 --> 35:03.549
- What if it falls off?

35:04.964 --> 35:06.483
- What if it falls off?

35:06.518 --> 35:09.245
Well, maybe you ought
to strap it down, Jimmy.

35:09.279 --> 35:10.556
- With what?

35:10.591 --> 35:11.868
- Jesus Christ.

35:11.902 --> 35:12.869
- Well, how about a rope?

35:12.903 --> 35:14.112
- You got a rope?

35:14.146 --> 35:15.803
- Yeah, I do have a rope.

35:15.837 --> 35:17.701
In fact everyone's got a rope.
You're on a fucking ranch.

35:17.736 --> 35:19.117
Here, give me this shit.
Just give it to me.

35:19.151 --> 35:21.326
Give it to me.
Take that shit off.

35:28.988 --> 35:30.197
Give it to me.

35:41.069 --> 35:42.933
- Where's our first stop?

35:42.968 --> 35:45.453
- Our first stop
is shut the fuck up, all right?

35:45.488 --> 35:47.145
And our second stop is
you make yourself useful

35:47.179 --> 35:49.561
at these horse shows.
This ain't no fucking Uber.

35:49.595 --> 35:51.666
- We got to ride to Scottsdale
with this fucking guy?

35:51.701 --> 35:53.461
- You don't fucking
snore, do you, Jimmy?

35:53.496 --> 35:56.809
- I don't know.
I've never heard myself sleep.

35:56.844 --> 35:57.879
- You look like you snore.

35:57.914 --> 35:59.191
- Okay, that's it.
Hey, Tom?

35:59.226 --> 36:01.504
You don't have any room
in that big fucking thing?

36:01.538 --> 36:03.195
- Sure, last stall
in the trailer.

36:04.990 --> 36:06.716
All right, we're just going to
drown this fucker out.

36:06.750 --> 36:08.131
- Put some road music on.

36:08.166 --> 36:09.891
- Yes.
- A little Shane Smith.

36:09.926 --> 36:12.066
- Shane Smith and
the fucking Saints.

38:25.475 --> 38:27.374
he tricked me.

38:30.377 --> 38:32.171
Well, why don't you
let me work on the boy?

I want you to listen to me.

38:54.815 --> 38:56.748
He's not our son.

38:58.750 --> 39:01.339
No matter what he becomes,
he'll never be that.

39:04.307 --> 39:05.343
Nobody will.

39:08.207 --> 39:10.865
- The day's coming
when you'll resent me for that.

39:12.419 --> 39:13.489
- No, I won't, sweety.

39:17.285 --> 39:18.425
- It's coming.

39:20.219 --> 39:21.807
You'll see.

39:41.551 --> 39:42.587
- You hungry?

39:43.795 --> 39:44.796
- No.

39:47.764 --> 39:48.800
- You need to eat.

39:48.834 --> 39:50.284
- Is that what I need?

40:02.986 --> 40:06.058
Hey, buddy.
I brought you some dinner.

40:06.093 --> 40:07.439
- Leave it.

40:09.855 --> 40:12.375
- Come on out and eat, okay?

40:12.410 --> 40:14.135
- He's not coming out today.
He's worse today.

40:16.137 --> 40:18.485
- Son, come on out.

40:18.519 --> 40:20.348
- I said leave it.

40:20.383 --> 40:22.523
- He's not coming out
if someone's in the room.

40:22.558 --> 40:24.318
- I'm not someone.

40:24.352 --> 40:25.906
I'm his father.

40:30.151 --> 40:33.327
What's he gonna do, just live
under the fucking bed?

40:33.361 --> 40:36.434
I been telling you for weeks,
he needs to see a doctor.

40:36.468 --> 40:38.436
You're making it worse just
letting him stay under there.

40:38.470 --> 40:40.472
- I'm not letting
him do anything.

40:40.507 --> 40:42.129
You want me to drag
him out by his feet?

40:42.163 --> 40:43.717
- Yeah, that's exactly
what you should do.

40:43.751 --> 40:44.787
- No!
- Kayce!

40:44.821 --> 40:47.168
- Come here, buddy.
- No, get off!

40:47.203 --> 40:49.101
- Kayce!

40:49.136 --> 40:51.449
- Stop!
No!

40:51.483 --> 40:52.864
- It's okay.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

40:52.898 --> 40:54.003
- Stop.

40:55.142 --> 40:56.557
- It's okay.

40:56.592 --> 40:58.283
Being under the bed is not
going to make you safe, okay?

40:58.317 --> 41:01.769
You're the only thing that's
going to make you safe.

41:01.804 --> 41:03.909
You got nothing to
be afraid of, all right?

41:03.944 --> 41:05.393
You already did it.

41:05.428 --> 41:07.741
Your biggest fear already came
and you already beat it, right?

41:09.363 --> 41:10.606
You already beat it.

41:12.021 --> 41:13.229
It's okay.

41:15.611 --> 41:16.888
Look at me.

41:16.922 --> 41:20.167
You beat it, huh?

41:20.201 --> 41:21.686
That's right.

41:21.720 --> 41:24.136
So just grab your plate
and go sit at the table

41:24.171 --> 41:26.484
like a human
and eat your dinner, okay?

41:37.322 --> 41:39.462
He's not scared.

41:39.497 --> 41:40.877
It's you who's making
him scared.

41:42.707 --> 41:45.399
- I begged you
not to bring us here.

41:46.400 --> 41:48.229
I told you that
this place was evil.

41:48.264 --> 41:49.437
I told you he was evil.

41:49.472 --> 41:50.853
And now we're all evil.

41:50.887 --> 41:52.095
- This place isn't evil.

41:52.130 --> 41:53.649
The people who tried to
take it from us were evil.

41:53.683 --> 41:55.651
And we're not evil
for defending it.

42:01.104 --> 42:02.278
- I hate you.

42:12.875 --> 42:14.428
I hate you.

42:27.130 --> 42:28.753
I want to go home.

42:32.653 --> 42:33.930
Please let me go.

43:20.598 --> 43:23.117
- Goddam you for
putting me in this situation.

43:28.433 --> 43:29.468
Ever shot a man?

43:32.230 --> 43:35.026
- Yeah. I've shot some men.

43:35.060 --> 43:36.544
- Where?

43:37.960 --> 43:40.790
- South Dakota, Nebraska.

43:40.825 --> 43:42.205
- On his body, dummy.

43:45.070 --> 43:46.589
- Back of the head.

43:48.867 --> 43:49.937
- Why the back of the head?

43:53.113 --> 43:55.425
- Shoot 'em in the chest
or stomach,

43:55.460 --> 43:58.601
they look right at you,
with all this...

43:58.636 --> 44:00.741
surprise in their eyes.

44:02.467 --> 44:04.538
Shoot 'em in
the back of the head

44:04.572 --> 44:07.990
they never know it's coming.

44:08.024 --> 44:11.683
Better for them.
Better for me.

44:11.718 --> 44:14.617
- This is one time I wish
I had your lack of character.

44:24.006 --> 44:25.835
Ah!

44:27.734 --> 44:29.218
Quit your whining.

44:38.227 --> 44:40.747
- About the simplest gun

44:40.781 --> 44:44.612
cock the hammer,
pull the trigger.

44:54.174 --> 44:56.832
- Ohh...

44:56.866 --> 44:59.041
I'd love nothing more

44:59.075 --> 45:01.699
than to shoot you in the back of
the head and be done with you,

45:01.733 --> 45:03.839
and there's nobody's watching

45:03.873 --> 45:05.461
so no one would know.

45:07.083 --> 45:08.671
But I'd know.

45:11.398 --> 45:14.712
So, we'll have ourselves
an old-fashioned shoot out.

45:26.931 --> 45:31.038
care to send me to Heaven before
I park your sorry ass in hell?

45:38.494 --> 45:40.634
- I ain't falling for this!

45:40.668 --> 45:42.981
That gun don't work
or some shit!

45:43.016 --> 45:44.569
- Naw, the gun's fine.

45:48.504 --> 45:51.610
This is as even
as it's gonna get.
