WEBVTT

01:13.560 --> 01:16.520
It's done.

01:38.440 --> 01:40.680
I'm leaving. Keep an eye on him.

04:27.120 --> 04:28.160
Where is he?

04:29.520 --> 04:30.520
Mr. Sartaj.

04:40.360 --> 04:41.280
Fuck! Fuck you!

04:54.240 --> 04:56.080
Majid, don't be a traitor.

04:56.280 --> 04:59.080
I'm following
the RAW officer's instructions.

04:59.720 --> 05:01.160
Stop bullshitting.

05:01.240 --> 05:02.400
Check the room.

05:02.960 --> 05:04.080
I said shut up.

05:04.160 --> 05:05.800
Just go and check.

05:17.520 --> 05:18.400
You got that?

05:23.960 --> 05:27.200
If I tell Parulkar
you're here despite being suspended,

05:27.760 --> 05:28.800
you will be fucked.

05:28.880 --> 05:33.200
Stop licking Parulkar's ass, Majid.
You were the best at the academy.

05:33.280 --> 05:36.440
Worry about your own ass. I'll show you.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.120
Okay, call him.

05:38.520 --> 05:44.280
Tell the RAW officer what you were doing
while I was solving the case.

05:52.880 --> 05:54.360
Long live India, sir.

05:55.480 --> 05:56.320
Yes, sir.

06:07.920 --> 06:10.400
Looks like all of the fake currency
is stored here.

06:10.960 --> 06:13.360
-How did you trace it?
-I tracked her car.

06:17.360 --> 06:20.760
Can you find out more
about Jojo Mascarenhas?

06:20.840 --> 06:22.200
Ma'am, what's going on?

06:29.760 --> 06:33.720
We have intel on an operation
involving fake currency.

06:34.240 --> 06:37.400
Gaitonde's warning
could be linked to this.

06:40.240 --> 06:41.840
I've been suspended from work.

06:41.920 --> 06:46.320
If Mr. Parulkar finds out about this,
I'll lose my job.

06:46.400 --> 06:49.320
You wouldn't be here
if your job meant so much to you.

06:49.400 --> 06:51.400
Find out what Jojo was doing there.

06:52.040 --> 06:55.320
What was Gaitonde talking about?
The 25-day warning?

06:55.400 --> 06:57.240
And Trivedi... Who is Trivedi?

06:57.360 --> 06:59.840
There are too many questions,
and we are running out of time.

07:00.600 --> 07:01.840
<i>Ma'am, it's an emergency.</i>

07:08.480 --> 07:09.520
Sartaj.

07:10.600 --> 07:12.960
I'm sending a team to seize the currency.

07:19.840 --> 07:20.880
What happened?

07:27.880 --> 07:29.320
Did anyone go inside? Let me see him.

08:08.760 --> 08:10.760
What the fuck?

08:13.720 --> 08:16.240
She won't leave
until I throw this on her head.

08:29.240 --> 08:30.240
What the fuck...?

08:32.680 --> 08:33.520
Yes, sir.

08:35.680 --> 08:41.880
<i>I came to Mumbai because this is where</i>
<i>my dreams could be realized.</i>

08:42.280 --> 08:47.480
<i>I'm friends with top models,</i>
<i>actresses, and movie stars.</i>

09:03.640 --> 09:06.440
-Who is that girl?
-Must be one of her hoes.

09:07.400 --> 09:08.360
Clients.

09:13.120 --> 09:16.480
Holy shit! Sir, that's her...

09:16.560 --> 09:17.600
-Nayanika.
-Who?

09:18.280 --> 09:21.400
Nayanika Sehgal. She's a TV star.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.200
<i>The Super Eye.</i>

09:25.120 --> 09:26.400
She is famous.

09:30.640 --> 09:32.120
-Her?
-Yeah.

09:38.520 --> 09:40.520
<i>Your mother is a fan of my show, right?</i>

09:41.320 --> 09:43.160
Yes, she watches every episode.

09:43.760 --> 09:44.840
And you?

09:46.360 --> 09:47.840
I'll watch your show now.

09:48.480 --> 09:50.080
Do you want an autograph?

10:10.920 --> 10:11.760
Who are you?

10:12.640 --> 10:14.240
Inspector Sartaj Singh.

10:14.880 --> 10:15.920
Mumbai Police.

10:18.040 --> 10:19.920
I want to ask you a few questions.

10:21.520 --> 10:24.320
Jojo is my manager. She handles my work.

10:24.400 --> 10:25.480
What kind of work?

10:28.480 --> 10:31.480
Well, TV, commercials...

10:32.440 --> 10:35.520
I just shot a commercial
for Scooter incense sticks.

10:35.600 --> 10:36.440
And?

10:38.600 --> 10:39.920
What else?

10:46.720 --> 10:48.680
Does she send you to clients?

10:52.000 --> 10:53.760
Who did she send you to?

10:57.760 --> 10:58.680
Nayanika...

11:00.120 --> 11:01.640
we want to help you.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.480
Don't be scared.

11:07.640 --> 11:10.000
Was Ganesh Gaitonde one of your clients?

11:11.080 --> 11:12.200
Then who?

11:15.240 --> 11:16.880
Jojo has been murdered.

11:20.880 --> 11:21.840
She's dead.

11:23.600 --> 11:26.080
You don't have to be
scared of her anymore.

11:36.400 --> 11:38.400
I'm not scared of her, Mr. Sartaj.

11:40.320 --> 11:41.320
Then who?

11:51.400 --> 11:55.400
She gets calls
from different numbers every night.

11:56.760 --> 11:59.400
All the numbers are different. No repeats.

12:01.280 --> 12:02.880
Did she say anything?

12:04.240 --> 12:06.560
She was too scared. She said nothing.

12:16.520 --> 12:19.280
Sir, I spoke to the retired constables.

12:19.560 --> 12:23.160
They said that your father
had nothing to do with Gaitonde.

12:25.080 --> 12:26.240
Here she comes.

13:19.520 --> 13:24.800
The gangster you are trying to reach
is currently unavailable.

13:25.040 --> 13:27.760
The gate is closed.

13:27.920 --> 13:29.720
Please try again later.

13:29.920 --> 13:32.160
To link your Social Security Number--

13:32.240 --> 13:33.240
Shut up.

14:59.720 --> 15:00.840
What a place, sir!

15:03.400 --> 15:05.120
Look at this fucker's bed.

15:07.840 --> 15:10.720
My entire family can sleep on it.

15:13.520 --> 15:15.080
Velvet handcuffs.

15:15.640 --> 15:17.560
Just like the ones the cops use.

15:18.360 --> 15:19.680
Have you ever used these?

15:23.560 --> 15:27.080
We don't even have room for a bed.
Where would we keep these?

15:27.200 --> 15:28.920
People have weird fantasies.

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
If I take these home,
my wife will hang me from the ceiling.

15:33.080 --> 15:36.280
She will hang me upside down
and set me on fire!

15:38.800 --> 15:44.280
Holy shit! What is all this?

15:44.960 --> 15:46.160
It's called S&amp;M.

15:46.360 --> 15:47.640
What?

15:48.960 --> 15:52.560
These are used for pleasure.
They are tied to the bed.

15:52.800 --> 15:55.960
You can have pleasure in pain
and pain in pleasure.

15:58.200 --> 16:02.640
Let's get these for our police station.
Pain and pleasure at the same time.

16:03.200 --> 16:04.680
Who is this psychopath?

16:51.160 --> 16:55.200
<i>Bunty. Some called him a pervert</i>
<i>and others, an animal.</i>

16:55.760 --> 16:57.720
<i>But no one really understood him.</i>

16:58.320 --> 17:00.960
<i>His veins had hatred running through them.</i>

17:01.160 --> 17:03.640
<i>Especially for Muslims.</i>

17:04.160 --> 17:07.440
<i>He triggered the Hindu-Muslim</i>
<i>conflict in my gang.</i>

17:08.240 --> 17:11.640
<i>It was Bunty who created all the chaos.</i>

17:11.720 --> 17:12.760
Hit harder!

17:15.160 --> 17:17.640
Hey, asshole... someone posted your bail.

17:22.080 --> 17:23.400
Hey, sign here!

17:27.160 --> 17:28.000
Hey!

17:35.240 --> 17:38.440
Why are you running away from me?
Are you embarrassed?

17:38.760 --> 17:42.200
Are you late for your clients?
Do you work round the clock?

17:44.280 --> 17:47.840
You should thank me for bailing you out,
you motherfucker!

17:50.680 --> 17:53.120
How many men did you fuck to bail me out?

17:54.480 --> 17:58.960
I got into this because of you.
Have you ever earned a penny in your life?

17:59.040 --> 18:02.680
You are lucky
we are at the police station, bitch!

18:08.560 --> 18:10.720
Boss wants to see you.

18:11.920 --> 18:13.040
Who is that?

18:23.080 --> 18:26.240
Do you only use talcum powder?
Don't you have perfumes?

18:26.800 --> 18:29.160
It has a fragrance. I'll spray it later.

18:29.760 --> 18:32.840
Mr. Isa only uses imported perfumes.

18:33.640 --> 18:35.000
He gets loads of it...

18:35.600 --> 18:36.600
every month.

18:45.800 --> 18:50.840
Bitch.
You don't deserve imported perfumes.

19:00.640 --> 19:03.200
Boss, I've brought the guy from the mill.

19:05.560 --> 19:06.880
You guys can continue.

19:19.440 --> 19:24.560
You will not fuck around
in my area... without my permission.

19:25.320 --> 19:26.160
Yes, boss.

19:26.840 --> 19:28.680
Gather your men.

19:30.400 --> 19:31.920
He will tell you what to do.

19:32.960 --> 19:34.400
Boss, I know what to do.

19:35.320 --> 19:37.440
My men are ready to die for you.

19:39.440 --> 19:40.720
Learn your job first.

19:42.160 --> 19:44.560
I will ask you for favors later.

19:44.640 --> 19:45.520
Yes, boss.

19:46.240 --> 19:48.240
-What's your name?
-Bunty.

19:49.440 --> 19:53.920
My official name is Deepak Shinde,
but everyone here calls me Bunty.

19:57.000 --> 20:00.280
<i>Every asshole in the city</i>
<i>knew me as the king of trash.</i>

20:00.360 --> 20:04.680
<i>But I was way ahead of them.</i>
<i>I had a beast like Bunty on my side.</i>

20:05.320 --> 20:08.240
<i>It was time to mess with Isa.</i>

20:31.240 --> 20:33.080
What was it you said last time?

20:34.280 --> 20:35.440
"Know your worth."

22:28.040 --> 22:30.120
<i>Kukoo... She was magical.</i>

22:30.800 --> 22:34.280
<i>Whoever won over Kukoo, ruled Bombay.</i>
<i>That's what I heard.</i>

22:34.440 --> 22:37.520
<i>Isa was invincible,</i>
<i>nothing could kill him.</i>

22:37.760 --> 22:40.600
<i>To defeat him, I had to take Kukoo away.</i>

22:52.800 --> 22:53.640
Hey, baby. Come with me.

22:56.600 --> 22:58.400
-Where will you take me?
-To paradise.

22:58.480 --> 22:59.880
I am paradise.

23:00.440 --> 23:02.400
Those who want to see paradise...

23:02.800 --> 23:03.840
they come to me.

23:06.360 --> 23:08.680
Besides, you look like shit.

23:09.640 --> 23:10.800
What do you do?

23:11.680 --> 23:12.880
I have just begun.

23:13.440 --> 23:15.600
Where do you want to go?
I'll drop you off.

23:16.920 --> 23:19.760
Do you know the guy in the red car?

23:19.840 --> 23:20.880
Suleiman Isa.

23:21.560 --> 23:24.560
If he finds out what you just told me...

23:25.640 --> 23:28.480
he will chop you into pieces.

23:29.040 --> 23:30.200
Do you belong to him?

23:32.160 --> 23:35.920
-Kukoo doesn't belong to anyone.
-Prove it. Come with me.

23:36.400 --> 23:38.080
Isa's reign is over.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.160
It's my time now.

23:41.080 --> 23:41.920
Think about it.

23:42.520 --> 23:45.840
The movie has just begun...

23:47.320 --> 23:51.840
and I've met my girl
in the very first scene.

23:52.800 --> 23:56.600
If you come with me,
we'll have a great time.

23:56.680 --> 24:00.160
If the girl leaves with her man
in the first scene,

24:00.360 --> 24:01.840
the movie will be a flop.

24:02.560 --> 24:04.400
The film can only be fantastic

24:04.680 --> 24:09.200
when the bad guy
loses the girl to the good guy.

24:09.280 --> 24:12.760
You want to be the good guy, right?
So, stop being a jerk.

24:13.760 --> 24:16.400
Kukoo only falls for action.

24:16.960 --> 24:21.720
<i>That's when I realized why the leaders</i>
<i>of Bombay were smitten by Kukoo.</i>

24:22.280 --> 24:26.200
<i>She wasn't the prize.</i>
<i>She was the road to victory.</i>

24:27.720 --> 24:31.360
<i>I didn't know then</i>
<i>that the Bombay we were fighting for</i>

24:32.000 --> 24:34.120
<i>would never belong to anyone.</i>

24:34.200 --> 24:39.840
<i>Isa and I would destroy it,</i>
<i>and with it, I would lose my life.</i>

24:40.440 --> 24:42.520
<i>I was obsessed with Kukoo,</i>

24:42.600 --> 24:44.720
<i>and the nation was obsessed</i>
<i>with its temples.</i>

24:44.800 --> 24:47.840
<i>Meanwhile, my third father</i>
<i>was wreaking havoc in others' lives</i>

24:47.920 --> 24:49.360
<i>before coming into mine.</i>

24:50.280 --> 24:53.920
Atapi and Vatapi were demon brothers.

24:55.120 --> 24:56.200
Atapi...

24:57.720 --> 24:59.680
targeted wandering travelers

25:00.240 --> 25:02.680
by inviting them to his home
with great affection.

25:03.360 --> 25:05.000
"Please come to my home.

25:05.080 --> 25:09.120
Perhaps you're hungry.
I'll offer you tasty food."

25:09.200 --> 25:10.040
BREAKING NEWS

25:10.120 --> 25:11.960
<i>The travelers would agree happily.</i>

25:12.640 --> 25:13.720
<i>Meanwhile...</i>

BABRI MASJID'S GATES UNLOCKED IN AYODHYA
MUSLIM COMMUNITY IN TURMOIL

25:15.440 --> 25:16.920
<i>...Vatapi, with the help</i>
<i>of mystical and demonic powers,</i>

25:17.560 --> 25:21.800
<i>would assume the form of a goat.</i>

25:22.320 --> 25:23.560
<i>-What form?</i>
<i>-A goat's.</i>

25:23.640 --> 25:24.520
<i>A goat's form.</i>

25:26.040 --> 25:30.960
<i>The guests would devour the goat meat</i>
<i>and feel contented.</i>

25:33.120 --> 25:36.160
<i>At that point, Atapi would call out</i>
<i>to his brother.</i>

25:36.880 --> 25:40.600
<i>"Vatapi! Come out!"</i>

25:42.240 --> 25:43.360
<i>Immediately,</i>

25:43.760 --> 25:47.760
<i>Vatapi would tear open</i>
<i>the guest's stomach and emerge.</i>

25:50.280 --> 25:52.480
<i>The traveler would die.</i>

25:53.200 --> 25:57.680
<i>And then the brothers,</i>
<i>Atapi and Vatapi, would rejoice.</i>

26:01.080 --> 26:03.240
<i>This is what religions are all about.</i>

26:07.160 --> 26:11.560
<i>Entice the travelers, feed them,</i>

26:12.080 --> 26:13.680
<i>and then kill them.</i>

26:27.640 --> 26:30.080
<i>Jews and Muslims, Christians and Muslims,</i>

26:30.160 --> 26:31.400
<i>Hindus and Muslims...</i>

26:32.000 --> 26:34.160
<i>All are victims of Atapi and Vatapi.</i>

26:35.120 --> 26:36.680
<i>-Whose victims?</i>
<i>-Atapi and Vatapi's.</i>

26:36.760 --> 26:38.280
<i>Atapi and Vatapi's.</i>

26:38.360 --> 26:39.600
<i>All of them.</i>

26:51.800 --> 26:53.160
I brought this for you.

26:54.200 --> 26:55.520
Are you a big man now?

26:56.720 --> 26:57.600
Very big.

27:02.840 --> 27:04.920
You are, indeed.

27:16.480 --> 27:21.160
Look closely.
Parveen Babi wore this in the movie <i>Shaan</i>.

27:25.040 --> 27:26.160
It's fake.

27:26.960 --> 27:29.360
It's genuine. The same piece of jewelry.

27:31.280 --> 27:32.640
Where did you get it? I found it for you.

27:38.040 --> 27:40.920
I killed a few merchants.

27:41.040 --> 27:43.320
I can do anything for you.

27:46.200 --> 27:49.920
How did you know that I like Parveen Babi?

27:52.000 --> 27:54.400
The same face. The same eyes.

27:57.560 --> 27:59.560
The same figure. Exactly the same.

28:01.080 --> 28:02.560
Do you like Parveen Babi?

28:03.560 --> 28:05.800
If I didn't,
I wouldn't have dared to do this.

28:05.880 --> 28:07.480
I watched the movie <i>Deewaar</i> eight times.

28:08.520 --> 28:12.760
My dream is to see you
light two cigarettes

28:12.840 --> 28:14.920
and offer me one in my bed.

28:20.360 --> 28:23.800
You have the same pain in your eyes
as Parveen Babi's.

28:27.400 --> 28:29.880
-What kind of pain?
-The same pain.

28:32.440 --> 28:36.720
Everyone sees you,
but no one understands you.

28:39.160 --> 28:40.240
But I do.

28:42.680 --> 28:43.640
Totally.

31:15.520 --> 31:16.640
Move, motherfucker!

31:26.280 --> 31:27.280
Go! Go!

31:47.000 --> 31:50.400
<i>We waited a long time,</i>
<i>ready for Isa to exact his revenge.</i>

31:50.480 --> 31:53.480
<i>But he never showed up.</i>
<i>Because he was a bastard.</i>

31:54.160 --> 31:55.320
<i>He was in no hurry.</i>

31:55.880 --> 31:58.120
<i>He had a plan to strike back harder.</i>

32:06.960 --> 32:10.920
<i>Kukoo fell into my lap</i>
<i>like she had always been mine.</i>

32:11.560 --> 32:15.320
<i>The news was all over Bombay</i>
<i>that finally Isa had competition.</i> HAPPY BIRTHDAY, GAITONDE SIR

32:57.880 --> 33:00.320
<i>As a kid, I never celebrated my birthday.</i>

33:00.400 --> 33:03.320
<i>But that year,</i>
<i>even Bollywood star Mithun's impersonator</i>

33:03.440 --> 33:04.720
<i>danced at my party.</i>

33:36.280 --> 33:39.080
<i>And that was the first time</i>
<i>I saw Bipin Bhonsle.</i>

33:39.360 --> 33:42.440
<i>He ran a local Hindu committee</i>
<i>in Kailashpada,</i>

33:42.520 --> 33:45.240
<i>but dreamt of forming</i>
<i>his own political party.</i>

33:49.720 --> 33:53.120
<i>Nobody thought this imbecile would become</i>
<i>the next home minister.</i>

34:01.640 --> 34:05.600
That garland is worth 5000 rupees.
And he didn't even ask for my name.

34:06.040 --> 34:07.920
It was a waste of time.

34:09.760 --> 34:13.600
This is Mumbai. Anything is possible here.

34:15.400 --> 34:18.600
A filthy dog is going to take a shit
on the whole city.

34:22.320 --> 34:23.639
Bipin Bhonsle, sir.

34:23.760 --> 34:27.840
I will be contesting the election...

34:29.000 --> 34:32.400
<i>Bhonsle, Parulkar,</i>
<i>and the other asshole Trivedi.</i>

34:33.120 --> 34:37.040
<i>If I knew how badly</i>
<i>they would fuck me over later,</i>

34:37.400 --> 34:39.440
<i>I would have killed them that very day.</i>

35:32.920 --> 35:35.000
<i>What else did you find in Trivedi's house?</i>

35:35.080 --> 35:37.280
Everything was in order.

35:37.960 --> 35:41.600
The papers were on the table.
The milk was in the refrigerator.

35:45.200 --> 35:49.280
If there was no milk in his house,
it would mean something was wrong.

35:49.360 --> 35:50.600
You wouldn't understand.

36:06.280 --> 36:07.600
Where do I put this?

36:08.080 --> 36:09.000
Here, sir.

36:15.800 --> 36:16.640
Trivedi.

36:18.080 --> 36:21.520
An old friend of Bhonsle's.
This is a 25-year-old photograph.

36:23.000 --> 36:24.320
Find out where he is.

36:26.480 --> 36:27.560
Yes, sir.

36:30.400 --> 36:33.080
The RAW officer has kept Sartaj busy.

36:34.560 --> 36:35.480
Let her.

36:36.520 --> 36:38.480
He'll be back to fix your nose.

36:47.520 --> 36:48.360
Majid.

36:57.000 --> 36:59.600
Can this 5-star hotel be attacked?

37:01.920 --> 37:03.880
I mean, for serving this.

37:07.200 --> 37:08.640
Not while I'm here.

37:10.880 --> 37:13.680
I heard that you're working
on a big superhero film.

37:17.440 --> 37:21.080
But... you're the real superhero.

37:25.760 --> 37:29.440
Actually, I wanted access
to Jojo Mascarenhas' apartment.

37:32.800 --> 37:35.160
It's not under
the Mumbai police's jurisdiction.

37:36.840 --> 37:39.080
The RAW officers have seized everything.

37:44.600 --> 37:46.160
What do you want from there?

37:47.920 --> 37:51.080
Small-town girls tend to make mistakes.

37:52.560 --> 37:54.080
Something like that.

38:28.280 --> 38:30.840
Please, two minutes.

38:34.120 --> 38:36.080
We have Bunty Sharma's record.

38:37.880 --> 38:40.760
Violence against women, rape...

38:40.840 --> 38:42.440
There are many charges against him.

38:45.040 --> 38:48.240
But he's still a free bird, and I am not.

38:49.200 --> 38:51.200
I'll say it again, cooperate with us.

38:52.880 --> 38:54.640
Tell me what you know about Bunty.

38:56.320 --> 38:58.800
I know Bunty is the producer of your show.

38:59.320 --> 39:00.160
Don't worry.

39:00.920 --> 39:02.600
I won't let anyone hurt you.

39:12.920 --> 39:15.440
Bunty always talks about leaving Mumbai.

39:16.840 --> 39:19.960
He says he has one last job to finish
before leaving.

39:20.080 --> 39:21.280
What kind of job?

39:22.600 --> 39:23.480
I don't know.

39:23.560 --> 39:24.800
A job for Gaitonde?

39:25.560 --> 39:27.840
No, he never mentioned that name.

39:28.040 --> 39:29.720
Did he mention a date?

39:31.840 --> 39:32.800
No.

39:33.560 --> 39:35.840
He said he would leave in 20-25 days.

39:37.560 --> 39:38.400
Where to?

39:40.520 --> 39:41.440
He didn't say.

39:43.520 --> 39:45.320
He says he'll take me with him.

39:46.440 --> 39:47.280
And?

39:48.200 --> 39:49.600
I don't want to go.

39:58.800 --> 39:59.760
You won't.

40:01.680 --> 40:02.920
We'll help you...

40:04.360 --> 40:06.440
if you help us get Bunty.

40:08.600 --> 40:09.960
You don't have to do much.

40:10.520 --> 40:13.880
The next time he calls you,
inform us before you go to him.

40:13.960 --> 40:15.400
-No.
-Even he--

40:15.720 --> 40:17.560
-I don't want to go.
-Listen...

40:17.640 --> 40:19.600
Listen. Don't be scared.

40:20.160 --> 40:22.000
He won't learn about it.

40:36.200 --> 40:40.120
Ma'am, why are we sending her back
to Bunty instead of protecting her?

40:40.680 --> 40:44.400
If Bunty calls her and she doesn't go,
he'll get suspicious and go into hiding.

40:46.680 --> 40:50.440
-There has to be another way.
-We don't have the time.

40:50.520 --> 40:51.840
We only have 21 days. We'll keep her safe.

40:57.320 --> 41:00.560
The camera in this bag
will live-stream everything.

41:01.200 --> 41:06.200
Make sure not to cover its view.
Keep this next to you. This way.

42:10.160 --> 42:11.040
Zoya!

42:15.520 --> 42:16.360
Karan!

42:35.920 --> 42:37.080
Talent manager?

42:38.080 --> 42:41.080
She was your pimp.
I saw her here so many times.

42:42.720 --> 42:43.920
How would it feel...

42:44.720 --> 42:46.240
if tomorrow's headlines read:

42:46.320 --> 42:49.280
"Zoya, the self-made star from Kanpur,

42:49.800 --> 42:52.040
who is hard-working and independent...

42:52.680 --> 42:54.000
was Jojo's client"?

43:54.000 --> 43:55.080
<i>He called.</i>

43:56.600 --> 43:57.920
<i>I have half an hour.</i>

44:01.040 --> 44:02.040
<i>Sartaj?</i>

44:03.920 --> 44:04.840
I'm coming.
