00:00.055 --> 00:02.039
Previously on The Shannara Chronicles...

00:02.367 --> 00:04.539
The Changeling is an ancient Demon,

00:04.563 --> 00:07.078
that can inhabit the form
of any being it chooses.

00:09.055 --> 00:11.212
Long live the king.

00:12.219 --> 00:14.430
The truth has been lying to us.

00:14.469 --> 00:16.586
This sword is a talisman of evil.

00:16.638 --> 00:18.838
It is you who are the danger.

00:18.923 --> 00:21.140
The Druid is no more.

00:21.226 --> 00:22.759
Pykon's no fairy tale.

00:22.844 --> 00:26.479
My parents died in the dungeons
of that stinking Elvin Fortress.

00:26.564 --> 00:28.631
I'd really like to get
the hell out of here.

00:28.700 --> 00:30.683
- (roaring)
- Run!

00:30.769 --> 00:33.486
Hold on!

00:33.571 --> 00:34.771
(shouting)

00:36.357 --> 00:37.740
The hell with that!

01:00.815 --> 01:02.565
(startled gasping)

01:07.238 --> 01:09.572
The stones...

01:12.076 --> 01:14.243
(wincing)

01:30.595 --> 01:33.095
Amberle?

01:33.181 --> 01:34.514
Eretria?

01:48.279 --> 01:51.197
Eretria?!

01:55.286 --> 01:57.086
(crows cawing)

01:57.121 --> 01:59.455
Hello?

02:16.024 --> 02:17.306
Aah! Hey!

02:17.358 --> 02:19.725
Whoa, whoa, whoa! What are you doing?

02:19.811 --> 02:21.861
Who are you?

02:21.946 --> 02:23.980
(grunting, fighting)

02:25.533 --> 02:27.567
Come on, man. You're hurtin' yourself.

02:29.904 --> 02:31.287
- (grunting)
- Unh!

02:31.322 --> 02:33.206
Hey! Wait, wait, please!

02:33.291 --> 02:35.541
Whoa, whoa, whoa... wait! Please.

02:35.627 --> 02:37.710
You're one of them, aren't you?

02:37.795 --> 02:38.744
Who? One of who?

02:38.830 --> 02:41.631
The Elf hunters. They took my ear!

02:43.621 --> 02:45.721
Oh, no, it's okay. Look, I'm half-Elf.

02:49.057 --> 02:50.339
(stone clatters)

03:00.935 --> 03:02.652
Attacking isn't an option.

03:02.687 --> 03:05.438
The terrain is too hostile,
the army's too big...

03:05.523 --> 03:07.523
We'd be crushed before we
even reached the battlefield.

03:07.575 --> 03:08.991
Arion: What about the Federation?

03:09.027 --> 03:10.776
Even <i> if</i> they agreed to fight by our side

03:10.862 --> 03:13.663
and sent every available
soldier in the Four Lands,

03:13.698 --> 03:15.748
I still don't like our chances.

03:15.833 --> 03:18.751
What if it were not an attack,
but an assassination?

03:18.836 --> 03:21.370
We have the blade, and with
the Druid out of the way

03:21.422 --> 03:22.955
we have the advantage of surprise.

03:23.041 --> 03:24.874
A lot has happened in
your absence, brother.

03:24.926 --> 03:26.509
The Druid was in league
with the Dagda Mor.

03:26.544 --> 03:28.961
How is that possible?

03:29.047 --> 03:30.379
Oh, that means Amberle's...

03:30.431 --> 03:32.632
We have to assume that she's been misled.

03:32.717 --> 03:34.300
Tell me, if a force was small enough,

03:34.385 --> 03:35.851
could it reach the Henge undetected?

03:35.887 --> 03:38.387
Even if we got there,
it's surrounded by magic.

03:38.473 --> 03:40.222
Dark magic.

03:40.275 --> 03:45.728
The type that the Warlock
Blade was forged to combat.

03:45.813 --> 03:48.614
The Dagda Mor would be
powerless against it.

03:48.700 --> 03:51.067
You need to sneak in and kill him.

03:51.152 --> 03:52.318
You can't be serious.

03:52.403 --> 03:53.903
It's our only chance.

03:53.955 --> 03:55.571
At what, dying?

03:55.623 --> 03:57.406
We can't send our soldiers
to slaughter like that.

03:57.492 --> 03:59.375
Father, I should be the one to go.

03:59.410 --> 04:01.294
I will bring you back his head.

04:01.379 --> 04:03.629
Let me wield the blade for you.

04:03.715 --> 04:04.747
No.

04:04.799 --> 04:06.666
You're next in line, you're needed here.

04:06.751 --> 04:07.883
I'll go.

04:07.919 --> 04:11.671
You are both my sons.

04:11.756 --> 04:13.673
There are no two men on the
planet that I could be

04:13.758 --> 04:16.341
more certain of would
bring home a victory.

04:16.427 --> 04:18.010
You shall both go.

04:18.096 --> 04:20.012
Wha...

04:20.098 --> 04:21.012
But, Father, you...

04:21.099 --> 04:22.848
The decision is made.

04:22.934 --> 04:27.486
Two sons, one blade...

04:27.572 --> 04:28.938
One purpose.

04:33.945 --> 04:35.361
(Eventine laughing)

04:35.446 --> 04:38.531
The Demon won't even know you're coming.

(panting, coughing)

05:41.429 --> 05:44.346
Wil!

05:45.850 --> 05:47.850
Eretria!

05:55.576 --> 05:56.692
Woman: Where did he go?

05:56.744 --> 05:58.244
Man: I don't know.

05:58.329 --> 06:00.529
He slipped out of my hands.

06:01.999 --> 06:04.667
Woman: I need the other ear.

06:13.127 --> 06:14.343
You lost him.

06:14.378 --> 06:17.713
Elves just don't fall out
of the sky every day.

06:19.050 --> 06:20.266
Find that elf!

06:20.351 --> 06:21.467
Man: I'll find him.

06:21.552 --> 06:23.552
(gasping) Shhh!

06:26.057 --> 06:27.973
(whispering) They've
done something to Wil.

06:28.059 --> 06:31.644
- We need to...
- Those aren't just any humans.

06:31.729 --> 06:34.063
They're Elf hunters.

06:45.626 --> 06:49.211
(pained gasping)

06:55.206 --> 06:58.668
_

07:01.872 --> 07:06.317
_

07:47.722 --> 07:50.139
You look worried.

07:52.977 --> 07:57.780
It is not weakness to disobey
your father's orders.

07:57.815 --> 07:59.782
They are the king's orders.

08:01.819 --> 08:05.538
I know.

08:05.623 --> 08:07.489
But rushing in alone

08:07.575 --> 08:11.493
to kill the Dagda Mor is suicide.

08:11.579 --> 08:13.996
So is waiting.

08:21.255 --> 08:24.506
This is a chance to prove myself worthy.

08:26.510 --> 08:29.645
I know that you're upset with him,

08:29.680 --> 08:33.097
but you cannot make him
give you the crown.

08:34.769 --> 08:37.852
Now is the time to stand united.

08:37.905 --> 08:41.857
Together, behind the walls of Arborlon.

08:43.945 --> 08:45.277
I can't.

08:58.042 --> 09:00.292
This will stop the bleeding.

09:06.801 --> 09:09.718
Wow. It feels good.

09:11.722 --> 09:14.890
Mmm, real good. (giggling)

09:14.976 --> 09:18.727
This particular combo is also
good for recreational use.

09:21.732 --> 09:24.450
Tell me more about these hunters.

09:24.535 --> 09:28.737
Uh, they're human. Hate Elves.

09:28.789 --> 09:31.073
They hunt us down and harvest our ears.

09:32.326 --> 09:33.575
Harvest them?

09:33.628 --> 09:35.544
Harvest them for what?

09:35.579 --> 09:37.079
Gnomes.

09:37.131 --> 09:41.917
They think Elf ears have some
sort of medical properties.

09:42.003 --> 09:45.671
By this time next week, my
left ear will be ground up

09:45.756 --> 09:47.673
in some horny gnome's tea.

09:47.758 --> 09:50.342
I was travelling with two friends.

09:50.428 --> 09:53.929
I'm worried that these hunters
might have snatched them.

09:55.566 --> 09:57.232
Either of your friends an Elf?

09:58.936 --> 10:00.936
Then you should be worried.

10:06.444 --> 10:08.610
Eretria.

10:08.696 --> 10:09.945
Eretria, we have to go back.

10:09.997 --> 10:11.780
You're not safe back there.

10:11.832 --> 10:13.832
And so we just leave Wil?

10:13.918 --> 10:15.200
Of course not.

10:15.286 --> 10:17.036
We find cover, and then we go back

10:17.121 --> 10:19.455
and look for him once night falls.

10:19.540 --> 10:21.090
(twigs snapping)

10:26.464 --> 10:27.796
Run!

10:42.313 --> 10:44.029
Amberle!

10:44.115 --> 10:45.314
Come on!

10:58.713 --> 11:01.163
We lost them.

11:01.215 --> 11:04.466
We need to get back to camp
and round everyone up.

11:04.502 --> 11:06.335
Now!

11:06.387 --> 11:09.838
This isn't just any Elf we're hunting.

11:09.890 --> 11:11.757
This one is royal.

11:17.014 --> 11:19.598
That was close.

11:19.683 --> 11:21.066
Yeah, no kidding.

11:21.152 --> 11:22.317
You know, sometimes I feel like there's

11:22.353 --> 11:23.902
someone out there watching over us.

11:23.988 --> 11:26.238
Don't know if you call
it magic or fate...

11:26.323 --> 11:27.940
(snapping)

11:29.660 --> 11:31.193
(grunting)

11:43.368 --> 11:45.535
(coughing)

11:45.621 --> 11:47.821
(coughing continues)

11:53.149 --> 11:54.482
Are you okay?

11:56.102 --> 11:58.102
Yeah, I think so.

12:03.660 --> 12:05.276
Where are we?

12:06.963 --> 12:09.097
I don't know.

12:13.437 --> 12:15.854
Wait, I've heard of places like this.

12:19.410 --> 12:23.612
Buildings from the age of man,
buried during the great war.

12:24.949 --> 12:28.450
You can't seriously believe that.

12:28.535 --> 12:30.252
It would have rotted away by now.

12:31.622 --> 12:33.956
They were sealed and preserved.

12:34.041 --> 12:38.377
Like a butterfly caught in amber.

12:38.462 --> 12:40.712
It's almost like they
were gonna have a party.

12:41.882 --> 12:44.766
Place is creepy if you ask me.

12:44.802 --> 12:46.885
(flittering, screeching)

12:55.646 --> 12:56.862
Whatever this place is,

12:56.947 --> 12:58.613
we need to get out of here, and fast,

12:58.649 --> 13:01.783
before those Elf hunters find us.

13:01.819 --> 13:03.735
That's our way out.

13:09.910 --> 13:12.127
(horse whinnying)

13:12.162 --> 13:15.130
Man: We'll find out when she returns.

13:15.165 --> 13:16.965
(indistinct chattering)

13:17.001 --> 13:19.968
When they cut off my ear, the pain...

13:21.171 --> 13:22.554
When they went for the other one,

13:22.639 --> 13:23.722
my partner, Genewen,

13:23.807 --> 13:26.842
fought back, and I escaped.

13:26.927 --> 13:29.311
I think they have her in there.

13:29.346 --> 13:30.896
Maybe your friends, too.

13:30.981 --> 13:33.482
What were you two doing out here?

13:33.517 --> 13:34.816
We were on a scouting mission.

13:34.852 --> 13:36.485
We come from Olden Moor.

13:36.520 --> 13:37.769
Never heard of it.

13:37.855 --> 13:39.404
Some of the Elven settlements

13:39.490 --> 13:40.989
were coming under attack by demons,

13:41.025 --> 13:42.741
so we started scouting missions

13:42.826 --> 13:44.359
to warn the outlying villages.

13:47.831 --> 13:49.948
It's him. The one who took my ear.

13:51.752 --> 13:53.785
Wait here.

13:56.040 --> 13:57.289
Gather!

14:02.880 --> 14:06.048
We spotted an Elf and a human,

14:06.133 --> 14:08.216
travelling north below the ridge trail.

14:08.268 --> 14:11.219
- This Elf... is a royal.
- (amazed murmuring)

14:11.271 --> 14:13.388
Her ears will keep us in furs and drink

14:13.474 --> 14:15.023
for many winters to come.

14:15.059 --> 14:18.727
The first who hands me her head

14:18.812 --> 14:20.896
will be paid double.

14:20.948 --> 14:22.814
(laughing, chattering)

14:42.219 --> 14:45.637
They had no idea their
world was about to end.

14:45.722 --> 14:47.923
They look happy.

14:49.810 --> 14:51.726
They look dead to me.

14:53.097 --> 14:55.230
You can drop the whole
tough girl act, you know.

14:55.265 --> 14:57.015
What's that supposed to mean?

14:57.101 --> 15:00.235
You were across that line at Pykon.

15:00.270 --> 15:02.270
You could have easily left
us there, but you didn't.

15:02.356 --> 15:04.940
You came back, you saved my life.

15:05.025 --> 15:07.109
Don't overthink it, Princess.

15:07.161 --> 15:09.494
You die, I don't get paid.

15:09.580 --> 15:10.829
I don't believe that.

15:10.914 --> 15:12.080
I don't care.

15:18.505 --> 15:19.921
Fine, I do care.

15:23.844 --> 15:25.794
Why don't we braid each other's hair,

15:25.879 --> 15:28.597
have a party, talk about
the boys we like?

15:28.632 --> 15:30.265
Sound good to you?

15:30.300 --> 15:31.967
Hilarious.

15:32.052 --> 15:34.019
Now, why don't you put
that stupid book down

15:34.104 --> 15:36.304
and help me find a way out of this tomb?

15:50.037 --> 15:51.536
Anything I can say to stop you

15:51.622 --> 15:53.321
from going on this suicide mission?

15:53.373 --> 15:55.740
I could think of a few that
might delay me for a few hours.

15:55.826 --> 15:58.493
I'm serious. I have a bad feeling.

15:59.746 --> 16:01.213
What choice do I have?

16:01.298 --> 16:05.667
The Druid is gone,
Amberle is out of reach.

16:05.752 --> 16:07.919
People are losing hope.

16:08.005 --> 16:12.174
Thanks to you, we know
exactly where our enemy is.

16:12.226 --> 16:13.975
And for the first time
since this war began,

16:14.011 --> 16:17.429
we have a weapon strong
enough to defeat their magic.

16:20.567 --> 16:21.900
Okay, you're right.

16:21.985 --> 16:24.736
The people need you.

16:24.821 --> 16:26.521
Yes, they do.

16:33.080 --> 16:36.031
Got any last words of
advice for me, Commander?

16:37.417 --> 16:38.617
Don't die.

16:38.702 --> 16:40.368
That is an excellent plan.

17:12.069 --> 17:13.902
(shallow gasping)

17:13.987 --> 17:15.819
(screaming)

17:28.752 --> 17:30.418
Bremen?

17:30.504 --> 17:33.088
Yes, my apprentice.

17:33.173 --> 17:35.757
I have walked these lands

17:35.842 --> 17:38.260
for over 300 years.

17:38.345 --> 17:40.262
I am tired.

17:40.314 --> 17:44.182
Tired of people refusing
to believe the truth.

17:45.269 --> 17:48.270
I am ready to leave, Master.

17:48.355 --> 17:52.657
I am ready to join you on the other side.

17:52.743 --> 17:54.359
It is not your time.

17:55.445 --> 17:57.579
There's work yet to be done.

17:59.449 --> 18:02.334
What more can I do...

18:02.419 --> 18:03.785
alone?

18:03.870 --> 18:07.839
You are not alone.

18:07.924 --> 18:09.674
Another has emerged.

18:09.760 --> 18:13.295
Powerful, full of promise.

18:13.380 --> 18:17.215
And without you, they cannot
fight what is coming.

18:19.803 --> 18:22.137
You must be strong.

18:22.222 --> 18:25.390
The world is at a tipping point.

18:25.475 --> 18:26.775
Without you,

18:26.810 --> 18:28.610
all will be lost.

18:40.073 --> 18:41.406
Bremen...

19:08.598 --> 19:10.598
We need to find a door out of here.

19:21.077 --> 19:23.444
I think this is it.

19:34.874 --> 19:36.457
We're never gonna get out of here.

19:44.300 --> 19:45.683
You're hurt.

19:45.768 --> 19:47.768
It's just a scratch.

19:51.357 --> 19:53.858
You need to get warm.

19:53.943 --> 19:57.061
I need to take a look at that.

19:58.481 --> 20:00.815
So you do care?

20:01.251 --> 20:03.533
About you slowing us down? Yes.

20:03.620 --> 20:04.986
Come on, let's go.

20:25.675 --> 20:27.975
Zora: Hunters, move out.

20:29.228 --> 20:31.679
Cormac, guard the camp.

20:36.686 --> 20:38.269
I'm going after my friends.

20:38.354 --> 20:39.437
I have to follow.

20:39.522 --> 20:40.988
As soon as I find them, we'll come

20:41.024 --> 20:42.523
and help you get Genewen back.

20:42.608 --> 20:44.025
You have my word.

20:44.110 --> 20:45.776
Will you wait?

20:45.862 --> 20:48.162
I'll wait, but only because
I owe you my life.

20:55.371 --> 20:58.039
That's my ear.

20:58.091 --> 21:00.091
Hey, Perk! You said you'd wait.

21:00.176 --> 21:02.677
That's... my... ear!

21:11.771 --> 21:13.387
Little one.

21:13.473 --> 21:15.306
You came back.

21:15.391 --> 21:17.441
You owe me another ear.

21:17.527 --> 21:19.894
Aah!

21:36.295 --> 21:38.329
(screaming)

21:40.583 --> 21:42.383
Sure you want to do that?

21:53.312 --> 21:56.847
It happened when I hit the water.

21:56.933 --> 21:59.483
I floated downstream, and it slammed

21:59.569 --> 22:02.186
into this jagged rock.

22:02.271 --> 22:04.772
Thought I was going to drown.

22:06.526 --> 22:08.192
Do you think he made it?

22:08.277 --> 22:10.411
Of course he did.

22:10.446 --> 22:11.746
Do you know how many times

22:11.781 --> 22:14.115
I've tried to get rid of that guy?

22:14.167 --> 22:17.334
He'll probably sail in here
and save the day any minute.

22:17.420 --> 22:18.786
Exactly.

22:20.456 --> 22:21.956
And he was in your vision.

22:22.008 --> 22:24.759
I'm guessing your old tree
has no reason to lie.

22:30.049 --> 22:33.384
What'd you see in there anyway?
You never told me.

22:35.221 --> 22:37.721
I saw you and Wil.

22:39.475 --> 22:42.393
Standing in front of this
incredible stained glass window.

22:47.984 --> 22:50.151
It was right after I...

22:55.658 --> 22:58.125
Right after what?

22:58.161 --> 23:00.795
Right after I killed Wil.

23:03.132 --> 23:04.665
The tree said I had to do it to prove

23:04.717 --> 23:06.133
I was ready for what's ahead.

23:06.169 --> 23:09.553
I'm sorry you had to do that.

23:09.639 --> 23:11.338
Not as sorry as I am.

23:13.176 --> 23:16.143
The things we've seen
since this all started.

23:17.430 --> 23:20.681
All the innocent blood
that's been spilled.

23:21.851 --> 23:24.819
You know, and what's the point?

23:24.854 --> 23:26.520
Now that I know what my grandfather did

23:26.572 --> 23:27.771
in the name of our kind?

23:27.857 --> 23:29.156
Maybe you were right about the Elves.

23:29.192 --> 23:31.358
Maybe we don't deserve saving.

23:31.444 --> 23:32.910
Yeah, maybe none of us do.

23:32.995 --> 23:34.578
Perhaps it would be better for the Demons

23:34.664 --> 23:36.413
to do their bidding.

23:36.499 --> 23:38.949
Wash the slate clean.

23:39.035 --> 23:41.869
Well, it didn't work out
too well the last time.

23:49.095 --> 23:52.213
I know how it feels to be
trapped by your own life.

23:54.767 --> 23:57.351
I didn't exactly choose to be a Rover.

23:58.554 --> 24:00.221
You said you were bought?

24:02.391 --> 24:04.859
So the story goes.

24:05.978 --> 24:09.396
According to Cephalo,
he vastly underpaid.

24:09.482 --> 24:13.117
Guess my first owners were
pretty eager to unload me.

24:13.202 --> 24:15.369
And who knows about my parents.

24:15.404 --> 24:17.488
That's awful.

24:22.295 --> 24:25.746
A child shouldn't be left
to walk through life alone.

24:28.467 --> 24:30.417
On the bright side, we've
finally found something

24:30.503 --> 24:32.052
that we have in common.

24:33.556 --> 24:35.222
We're orphans.

24:40.096 --> 24:43.764
Well, it's a reach, but I'll take it.

24:45.568 --> 24:47.768
Who would've thought?

24:47.853 --> 24:50.905
The Princess and the Rover.

24:50.940 --> 24:53.023
Bound by a tragic fate and...

24:53.109 --> 24:54.658
Hot for the same guy?

24:54.744 --> 24:56.110
(chuckling)

24:56.195 --> 24:59.113
One hell of a mess, aren't we?

25:02.285 --> 25:03.951
(crash)

25:10.793 --> 25:12.293
Zora: They're here.

25:12.378 --> 25:13.877
Find them.

25:14.964 --> 25:16.297
Nobody gets out.

25:27.128 --> 25:29.462
Now, about my friends.

25:29.547 --> 25:31.264
Tell me where you last saw them.

25:31.299 --> 25:32.298
Why bother?

25:32.384 --> 25:35.018
They're probably dead already.

25:35.103 --> 25:37.604
Zora... She's the best Elf Hunter

25:37.639 --> 25:39.555
this side of the Drey Wood.

25:40.642 --> 25:42.442
It's all you.

25:42.477 --> 25:44.477
Wait! Wait! Okay, okay.

25:44.529 --> 25:45.812
Okay.

25:45.864 --> 25:49.232
Head east, past the treeline.

25:49.317 --> 25:50.483
Follow the game trail.

25:50.568 --> 25:51.818
That's where they disappeared.

25:51.903 --> 25:53.870
I swear, I swear, that's all that I know.

25:53.955 --> 25:57.490
Thanks, you did the right thing.

25:57.575 --> 25:59.409
- Go ahead.
- What?

25:59.494 --> 26:01.411
You didn't think we were going
to just let you go, did you?

26:01.496 --> 26:03.329
Wait...

26:03.415 --> 26:04.664
It's okay, tough guy.

26:06.584 --> 26:08.584
Torture's not really my thing.

26:08.670 --> 26:10.253
(chuckling)

26:16.678 --> 26:18.978
Taking out a serial Elf
killer, on the other hand,

26:19.014 --> 26:20.096
is a top priority.

26:20.181 --> 26:21.848
You didn't have to do that.

26:21.900 --> 26:23.816
Kill or be killed, that's the only way.

26:23.852 --> 26:26.569
No, it's not. It makes you
just as bad as he is.

26:26.655 --> 26:29.272
He got what he deserved,
and I'm not sorry.

26:35.447 --> 26:36.996
Give me a hand.

26:41.169 --> 26:43.419
Hey, girl, you okay?

26:43.505 --> 26:45.455
(screeching)

26:45.540 --> 26:47.540
That is Genewen?

26:47.592 --> 26:49.792
(screeching)

26:54.466 --> 26:56.599
Split up.

26:56.685 --> 26:57.967
We'll cover more ground.

26:58.053 --> 27:00.219
We need to get those ropes.

27:10.982 --> 27:12.365
Please don't hurt me.

27:29.084 --> 27:30.249
Thanks.

27:46.518 --> 27:48.234
(grunting)

28:14.879 --> 28:16.295
Let's get out of here.

28:34.566 --> 28:36.315
There's a small ravine
that runs to the west

28:36.401 --> 28:37.784
of the breakline.

28:37.819 --> 28:40.953
Lets out just beyond
the Dagda Mor's Henge.

28:40.989 --> 28:42.572
It's our best chance of slipping past

28:42.657 --> 28:43.990
the Demon army and getting to him.

28:44.075 --> 28:46.459
Let's hope that blade protects us.

28:46.494 --> 28:48.961
I'm willing to bet they're not
expecting two idiot princes

28:48.997 --> 28:50.413
to fly in there solo.

28:51.916 --> 28:54.000
We've got that to our advantage.

28:57.806 --> 29:00.006
There's no way we're going to
make it out of there alive,

29:00.058 --> 29:02.175
right?

29:05.563 --> 29:07.814
That's the burden of princes.

29:19.277 --> 29:20.359
Come on.

29:24.499 --> 29:26.699
What?

29:28.453 --> 29:30.286
She's still here.

29:30.371 --> 29:31.838
We have to go.

29:41.132 --> 29:43.466
That's the window from my vision.

29:47.805 --> 29:49.188
Ending up here was no accident.

29:49.224 --> 29:51.307
This is how we find the Bloodfire.

29:51.392 --> 29:53.142
Are you sure?

29:53.228 --> 29:55.061
Positive.

29:57.649 --> 30:00.233
Long time no see, Eretria.

30:07.139 --> 30:08.889
I always knew we'd meet again.

30:08.941 --> 30:11.391
Happy to see you too, Zora.

30:13.548 --> 30:15.098
You two know each other?

30:15.133 --> 30:17.216
We grew up together.

30:17.302 --> 30:20.636
When was the last time we saw each other?

30:20.722 --> 30:23.723
Oh... that's right.

30:24.120 --> 30:25.586
When you left me.

30:27.007 --> 30:28.840
Well, that's an exaggeration.

30:28.925 --> 30:32.176
We had a thing, but you
got a little clingy.

30:32.262 --> 30:34.212
Do you know what it was like for me?

30:34.297 --> 30:35.630
Alone?

30:35.715 --> 30:37.465
In the wilderness?

30:37.517 --> 30:40.601
So you started collecting
Elf ears for a living?

30:41.805 --> 30:43.137
Sit.

30:50.480 --> 30:53.147
I'm impressed with how
you took out my hunters.

30:53.233 --> 30:56.451
Not bad for a pampered
princess and her...

30:56.486 --> 30:58.403
what are you anyway?

30:58.488 --> 30:59.654
Her pet?

30:59.706 --> 31:02.323
You're an embarrassment
to the human race.

31:02.375 --> 31:04.542
Well, coming from you, I'll
take it as a compliment.

31:04.627 --> 31:06.994
I don't know what's going
on between the two of you,

31:07.047 --> 31:09.497
but you need to let us go.

31:09.582 --> 31:10.882
Is that right?

31:10.967 --> 31:12.500
Don't bother.

31:12.552 --> 31:15.386
The Four Lands is in danger.

31:15.472 --> 31:18.222
You must have heard about
the Demon attacks.

31:18.308 --> 31:20.508
I'm not interested in
your stories, Princess.

31:22.512 --> 31:24.479
Just your ears.

31:53.760 --> 31:55.510
Something's wrong.

31:57.046 --> 31:59.297
There should be thousands
upon thousands of Demons.

31:59.382 --> 32:01.132
I saw them here with my own eyes.

32:01.217 --> 32:03.050
You're sure this is the right place?

32:03.136 --> 32:04.218
Yes.

32:06.973 --> 32:08.556
There.

32:08.608 --> 32:10.725
That's the Dagda Mor's Henge.

32:10.810 --> 32:12.727
Totally unguarded.

32:12.779 --> 32:15.563
Perhaps the Demons have
already been dispatched

32:15.615 --> 32:18.366
and are marching on Arborlon.

32:18.401 --> 32:19.534
Or Amberle.

32:23.740 --> 32:25.790
Now is the time to strike, is it not?

32:25.875 --> 32:27.708
You with me, brother?

32:27.744 --> 32:29.210
I'm ready.

32:42.509 --> 32:46.060
Afraid there's only room
for two on this ride.

32:46.095 --> 32:48.262
Maybe in the next life?

32:51.768 --> 32:53.434
Shame you have to die.

33:05.782 --> 33:09.033
(screeching)

33:14.707 --> 33:16.841
Wil!

33:16.926 --> 33:18.292
You're alive!

33:21.464 --> 33:22.797
What is that?

33:22.882 --> 33:24.632
- (screeching)
- She's called a Roc.

33:24.717 --> 33:26.634
I saved her and her partner, Perk.

33:26.686 --> 33:28.186
He's a Wing Rider.

33:28.271 --> 33:30.471
- (Zora moaning)
- Let's go!

33:34.277 --> 33:35.643
Wil: Hold on.

33:37.897 --> 33:39.397
Eretria!

33:41.734 --> 33:43.317
We have to go back!

33:56.132 --> 33:58.332
Aah!

34:41.976 --> 34:43.893
Bandon?

34:47.032 --> 34:49.866
(roaring)

35:04.299 --> 35:06.383
I've been expecting you.

35:06.418 --> 35:07.634
Keep your distance.

35:07.719 --> 35:09.252
We don't know what he's capable of.

35:09.352 --> 35:10.685
Foolish prince.

35:10.770 --> 35:12.971
I tell you to fetch me my sword,

35:13.056 --> 35:14.472
and you do it.

35:14.557 --> 35:17.275
I command you to kill the Druid,

35:17.310 --> 35:19.610
and you run him through.

35:19.646 --> 35:22.146
They were the King's commands.

35:22.198 --> 35:25.066
Your father is dead.

35:25.151 --> 35:26.484
Father...

35:26.536 --> 35:30.321
And you are my puppet.

35:30.373 --> 35:32.373
Ander, no!

35:32.459 --> 35:33.825
Aah!

35:38.665 --> 35:39.914
Aah!

35:40.000 --> 35:43.918
I tricked you into
delivering me this sword.

35:44.004 --> 35:46.504
Now you will test its blade.

35:53.013 --> 35:54.429
No!

36:09.029 --> 36:11.362
No!

36:29.132 --> 36:33.017
(chanting)

36:42.112 --> 36:44.729
(screaming)

37:57.137 --> 38:00.438
- It's taking too long.
- He'll be back.

38:00.473 --> 38:02.640
You just got to be patient.

38:04.360 --> 38:05.860
What you got there?

38:05.945 --> 38:08.312
Oh, it's just something I found inside.

38:09.566 --> 38:10.982
What are they?

38:11.034 --> 38:12.950
It's just some sort of game, or...

38:12.986 --> 38:15.403
I don't know, it's silly.

38:15.488 --> 38:17.288
No, tell me.

38:23.413 --> 38:25.830
They reminded me of you.

38:31.171 --> 38:32.887
Perk: Hey!

38:32.972 --> 38:34.922
Any sign?

38:35.008 --> 38:36.507
They packed her up and
headed out quickly.

38:36.593 --> 38:38.009
I think they're using
the trees for cover.

38:38.094 --> 38:41.429
I've done half a dozen
passes, and still nothing.

38:41.514 --> 38:42.597
We need to go on foot.

38:42.682 --> 38:44.015
Thank you, Perk.

38:44.067 --> 38:46.017
No, thank you.

38:46.102 --> 38:48.853
If you ever need me, use this whistle.

38:56.529 --> 38:58.946
She's out there alone.

38:59.032 --> 39:00.364
We'll find her.

39:00.416 --> 39:01.866
I promise.

39:41.241 --> 39:43.908
Arion charged the Dagda Mor head on.

39:43.993 --> 39:47.962
The truest act of bravery
I have ever seen.

39:48.047 --> 39:50.881
And you escaped the Henge unharmed?

39:50.917 --> 39:52.917
All because of my brother.

39:53.002 --> 39:55.586
He saved me, Father.

39:55.672 --> 39:59.006
He gave up his life, but
I couldn't help him.

40:05.982 --> 40:08.065
I'm sure you did everything you could.

40:09.352 --> 40:10.401
No, I didn't.

40:11.904 --> 40:13.771
But I'm gonna try and do my best now.

40:40.152 --> 40:41.183
Ander...

40:41.566 --> 40:43.324
Arion, my father...

40:45.761 --> 40:47.574
All gone. And now...?

40:52.165 --> 40:54.470
And now you are king.
