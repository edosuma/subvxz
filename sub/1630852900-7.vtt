WEBVTT

00:31.666 --> 00:33.366
WELCOME, WELCOME,

00:33.433 --> 00:34.166
WELCOME TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT!"

00:34.233 --> 00:34.833
I'M JOHN OLIVER.

00:34.900 --> 00:35.366
THANK YOU SO MUCH

00:35.433 --> 00:37.466
FOR JOINING US.

00:37.533 --> 00:38.333
IT'S BEEN ANOTHER BUSY WEEK.

00:38.400 --> 00:39.133
THE SENATE CONFIRMED

00:39.200 --> 00:40.133
KETANJI BROWN JACKSON TO THE

00:40.200 --> 00:42.533
SUPREME COURT.

00:42.600 --> 00:43.900
ELON MUSK JOINED THE BOARD

00:43.966 --> 00:45.033
OF TWITTER, PRESUMABLY TO

00:45.100 --> 00:47.000
INNOVATE NEW WAYS TO MAKE IT

00:47.066 --> 00:47.433
WORSE.

00:47.500 --> 00:48.333
AND THE RUSSIAN INVASION

00:48.400 --> 00:48.900
OF UKRAINE CONTINUED TO

00:48.966 --> 00:49.966
ESCALATE, WITH REPORTS OF

00:50.033 --> 00:52.566
UNFATHOMABLE HORRORS, STRONGLY

00:52.633 --> 00:53.033
SUGGESTING WAR CRIMES,

00:53.100 --> 00:56.233
IF NOT GENOCIDE.

00:56.300 --> 00:57.500
AND LOOK, I KNOW THIS IS

00:57.566 --> 00:59.266
ALLEGEDLY A COMEDY SHOW,

00:59.333 --> 01:00.500
AND I'VE JUST SAID THE MOST

01:00.566 --> 01:01.533
UPSETTING COLLECTION OF WORDS

01:01.600 --> 01:02.566
SINCE "LOUIS CK WINS GRAMMY

01:02.633 --> 01:04.333
FOR BEST COMEDY ALBUM."

01:04.400 --> 01:05.166
BUT WE DO NEED TO AT LEAST

01:05.233 --> 01:07.033
BRIEFLY DEAL WITH WHAT'S GOING

01:07.100 --> 01:08.400
ON IN UKRAINE, AND PARTICULARLY

01:08.466 --> 01:10.266
BUCHA, SITE OF SOME OF THE WORST

01:10.333 --> 01:11.466
IMAGES TO EMERGE THIS WEEK.

01:11.533 --> 01:13.666
BECAUSE RUSSIAN STATE TV IS

01:13.733 --> 01:16.200
GOING OUT OF ITS WAY NOT TO.

01:16.266 --> 01:18.500
HERE IS HOW ONE BROADCASTER

01:18.566 --> 01:20.000
THERE SPUN THOSE TERRIBLE IMAGES

01:20.066 --> 01:24.066
OF BODIES IN THE STREETS.

01:24.133 --> 01:25.200
>> THERE ARE PEOPLE ON THE

01:25.266 --> 01:26.100
SCREEN THAT ARE LYING DEAD

01:26.166 --> 01:26.900
IN THE STREET WITH WHITE

01:26.966 --> 01:28.433
ARM BANDS.

01:28.500 --> 01:30.400
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

01:30.466 --> 01:31.400
IT MEANS THAT AFTER RUSSIAN

01:31.466 --> 01:33.133
FORCES LEFT BUCHA,

01:33.200 --> 01:34.933
THE SO-CALLED LIBERATORS CAME IN

01:35.000 --> 01:35.666
AND THEY SIMPLY KILLED PEACEFUL

01:35.733 --> 01:37.200
CIVILIANS.

01:37.266 --> 01:38.200
ON THE SCREEN,

01:38.266 --> 01:40.633
PEOPLE ARE MOVING.

01:40.700 --> 01:42.100
THAT MEANS THAT ACTORS

01:42.166 --> 01:42.866
WERE ALSO INVOLVED.

01:42.933 --> 01:43.600
A CONCLUSION OUT OF ALL OF THIS

01:43.666 --> 01:45.800
IS THAT TO ACHIEVE

01:45.866 --> 01:48.700
THEIR MEDIA GOALS,

01:48.766 --> 01:50.400
THE UKRAINIAN KYIV REGIME,

01:50.466 --> 01:51.066
KILLED ITS OWN PEOPLE.

01:51.133 --> 01:51.866
YEAH, SO THAT MAN'S

01:51.933 --> 01:53.233
OFFICIAL ARGUMENT IS UKRAINIANS

01:53.300 --> 01:55.000
KILLED THEIR OWN CIVILIANS,

01:55.066 --> 01:56.000
WHO ACTUALLY AREN'T CIVILIANS;

01:56.066 --> 01:56.900
THEY'RE ACTORS WHO WERE JUST

01:56.966 --> 01:57.900
PRETENDING TO BE DEAD, AND THE

01:57.966 --> 01:58.966
UKRAINIAN GOVERNMENT ITSELF IS

01:59.033 --> 02:00.433
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE REAL

02:00.500 --> 02:01.566
SLAUGHTER OF ITS OWN FAKE

02:01.633 --> 02:04.100
CIVILIANS.

02:04.166 --> 02:05.933
THAT'S OBVIOUSLY RIDICULOUS, AND

02:07.500 --> 02:09.600
DON'T OVERCOMPLICATE.

02:09.666 --> 02:10.933
THERE'S A REASON THE LINE IS

02:11.000 --> 02:12.666
"I DEFINITELY HAVE A GIRLFRIEND,

02:12.733 --> 02:14.133
SHE JUST GOES TO ANOTHER SCHOOL"

02:14.200 --> 02:14.700
AND NOT, "I DEFINITELY HAVE

02:14.766 --> 02:16.166
A GIRLFRIEND, SHE'S ACTUALLY

02:16.233 --> 02:17.833
TWINS, SOMETIMES THEY MERGE AND

02:17.900 --> 02:19.233
BECAME ONE REALLY BIG GIRL, I'D

02:19.300 --> 02:20.700
INVITE YOU TO COME OVER AND MEET

02:20.766 --> 02:21.333
THEM, BUT THAT MIGHT BE

02:21.400 --> 02:22.566
CONFUSING, BECAUSE I AM YOU FROM

02:22.633 --> 02:24.733
THE FUTURE."

02:24.800 --> 02:25.966
RUSSIAN STATE TV HAS BEEN

02:26.033 --> 02:28.333
GRASPING AT STRAWS ALL WEEK,

02:28.400 --> 02:28.933
WITH A PRESENTER AT ONE POINT

02:29.000 --> 02:29.833
ARGUING, AS EVIDENCE THAT BUCHA

02:29.900 --> 02:31.200
WAS THE SITE OF A FALSE FLAG

02:31.266 --> 02:33.233
ATTACK, THAT "BIDEN SAID THAT

02:33.300 --> 02:35.333
PUTIN IS A BUTCHER.

02:35.400 --> 02:37.500
BUCHA SOUNDS LIKE BUTCHER.

02:37.566 --> 02:38.966
HOW COULD THEY NOT TAKE

02:39.033 --> 02:40.300
ADVANTAGE OF SUCH A TOWN?"

02:40.366 --> 02:42.200
WHICH IS JUST INSANE.

02:42.266 --> 02:43.866
IF BAD THINGS ONLY HAPPENED IN

02:43.933 --> 02:45.700
PLACES WITH NAMES THAT SOUNDED

02:45.766 --> 02:47.400
SCARY, ALL OF AMERICA'S WORST

02:47.466 --> 02:49.933
SHIT WOULD BE HAPPENING IN

02:50.000 --> 02:52.600
TOMBSTONE, ARIZONA,

02:52.666 --> 02:53.366
CAPE FEAR, NORTH CAROLINA,

02:53.433 --> 02:53.933
OR HELL, MICHIGAN

02:54.000 --> 02:56.300
AND NOT WHERE IT ACTUALLY

02:56.366 --> 02:58.033
TALLAHASSEE, FLORIDA.

02:58.100 --> 02:59.500
BUT THIS FLAGRANT LYING IS

02:59.566 --> 03:01.733
CONSISTENT WITH HOW RUSSIA'S

03:01.800 --> 03:02.333
STATE MEDIA'S DEALT WITH THIS

03:02.400 --> 03:03.466
WAR FROM THE BEGINNING.

03:03.533 --> 03:04.933
AT FIRST, THEY REFUSED TO EVEN

03:05.000 --> 03:06.600
ACKNOWLEDGE THERE WAS A WAR,

03:06.666 --> 03:08.200
LET ALONE ADDRESS CASUALTIES.

03:08.266 --> 03:09.600
JUST WATCH WHAT HAPPENED LAST

03:09.666 --> 03:11.400
MONTH WHEN A MILITARY OFFICER

03:11.466 --> 03:21.200
MERELY MENTIONED RUSSIAN DEATHS.

03:21.266 --> 03:27.633
>>

03:27.700 --> 03:46.666
WOW, CLOSE CALL THERE!

03:46.733 --> 03:47.700
RUSSIAN VIEWERS ALMOST LEARNED

03:47.766 --> 03:48.866
THAT THEIR TROOPS WERE BEING

03:48.933 --> 03:50.233
KILLED UNTIL THAT HOST JUMPED UP

03:50.300 --> 03:51.966
AND SCREAMED "WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,

03:52.033 --> 03:54.733
IXNAY ON THE ASUALTIES-KAY."

03:54.800 --> 03:55.800
SOME TRULY GRADE-A PROPAGANDA

03:55.866 --> 03:57.266
WORK FROM THE NETWORK THAT

03:57.333 --> 03:58.000
BROUGHT YOU "SHUT UP ABOUT

03:58.066 --> 03:59.866
VLADIMIR PUTIN'S ELECTION FRAUD"

03:59.933 --> 04:00.400
AND "POISONING OPPONENTS?

04:00.466 --> 04:03.466
LA, LA, LA.

04:03.533 --> 04:05.166
I CAN'T HEAR YOU."

04:05.233 --> 04:06.400
IT SEEMS RUSSIA IS DETERMINED TO

04:06.466 --> 04:07.400
DENY THE OBVIOUS AND TO JUSTIFY

04:07.466 --> 04:08.300
THE INDEFENSIBLE.

04:08.366 --> 04:09.266
BUT THAT'S GETTING INCREASINGLY

04:09.333 --> 04:11.200
HARD TO DO.

04:11.266 --> 04:12.766
AND IF YOU THINK "THOSE BODIES

04:12.833 --> 04:14.266
ARE ACTUALLY ACTORS" IS AS

04:14.333 --> 04:16.400
PATHETIC AS IT GOT, JUST LISTEN

04:16.466 --> 04:17.600
TO ROSSIYA-24'S RIDICULOUS

04:17.666 --> 04:22.433
EXPLANATION.

04:22.500 --> 04:23.200
>> THIS IS HOW THE

04:23.266 --> 04:24.866
PREPARATION FOR PERFORMANCE,

04:24.933 --> 04:25.466
LITERALLY, OF MILITARY ACTIONS

04:25.533 --> 04:26.566
IN UKRAINE IS TAKING PLACE.

04:26.633 --> 04:27.400
AS YOU CAN SEE, IT'S QUITE

04:27.466 --> 04:28.866
UNCOMPLICATED.

04:28.933 --> 04:29.633
TWO PEOPLE IN MILITARY UNIFORMS

04:29.700 --> 04:31.433
CAREFULLY WRAP THE MANNEQUIN

04:31.500 --> 04:32.500
WITH TAPE.

04:32.566 --> 04:33.500
OBVIOUSLY, THEY ARE GOING TO

04:33.566 --> 04:38.400
PASS IT OFF AS A CORPSE.

04:38.466 --> 04:39.000
LOOK, THAT'S CLEARLY

04:39.066 --> 04:39.833
ABSURD.

04:39.900 --> 04:41.033
NOT ONLY ARE THE UKRAINIAN

04:41.100 --> 04:42.000
CASUALTIES OBVIOUSLY REAL, THAT

04:42.066 --> 04:42.633
FOOTAGE TURNED OUT TO BE PART OF

04:42.700 --> 04:44.666
A TV DRAMA BEING FILMED NEAR

04:44.733 --> 04:45.666
ST. PETERSBURG LAST MONTH.

04:45.733 --> 04:47.566
AND IF YOU'RE WONDERING WHICH TV

04:47.633 --> 04:48.666
SHOW, IT'S ZOEY'S EXTRAORDINARY

04:48.733 --> 04:50.133
PLAYLIST.

04:50.200 --> 04:51.500
WHAT CAN I SAY?

04:51.566 --> 04:53.066
RUSSIAN AUDIENCES REALLY CONNECT

04:53.133 --> 04:53.733
WITH THE STORY OF A WOMAN FORCED

04:53.800 --> 04:54.933
TO HALLUCINATE A MORE JOYFUL

04:55.000 --> 04:56.700
EXISTENCE.

04:56.766 --> 04:58.300
AND CLEARLY, THERE WILL BE MORE

04:58.366 --> 04:59.433
TO SAY ABOUT THE UKRAINIAN

04:59.500 --> 05:01.200
SITUATION AS IT DEVELOPS.

05:01.266 --> 05:02.300
BUT FOR NOW, LET'S MOVE TO A

05:02.366 --> 05:03.433
MUCH LESS CONSEQUENTIAL STORY,

05:03.500 --> 05:05.100
CONCERNING OAN.

05:05.166 --> 05:06.733
THE NETWORK WITH A LOGO THAT

05:06.800 --> 05:08.033
LOOKS LIKE IT BELONGS ON THE

05:08.100 --> 05:08.600
SIDE OF A TRUCK TRANSPORTING

05:08.666 --> 05:10.233
REFRIGERATOR PARTS.

05:10.300 --> 05:11.700
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT OAN A FEW

05:11.766 --> 05:13.700
TIMES OVER THE YEARS, PRIMARILY

05:13.766 --> 05:14.300
BECAUSE THEY WERE TRUMP'S

05:14.366 --> 05:16.366
FAVORITE NEWS OUTLET,

05:16.433 --> 05:17.000
AS WELL AS A PERPETUAL SOURCE OF

05:17.066 --> 05:18.633
MISINFORMATION ABOUT COVID AND

05:18.700 --> 05:19.600
PLATFORM FOR PILLOW PRINCE MIKE

05:19.666 --> 05:21.300
LINDELL'S ELECTION-FRAUD

05:21.366 --> 05:23.333
DOCUMENTARY "ABSOLUTE PROOF."

05:23.400 --> 05:25.133
AND YES, I AM USING THE WORD

05:25.200 --> 05:26.666
DOCUMENTARY THERE WITH

05:26.733 --> 05:29.166
CHRISTLIKE GENEROSITY.

05:29.233 --> 05:31.400
THIS WAS A BIG WEEK FOR OAN,

05:31.466 --> 05:33.100
ALTHOUGH NOT IN A GOOD WAY, AS

05:33.166 --> 05:35.300
ONE OF THEIR ANCHORS EXPLAINED.

05:35.366 --> 05:36.900
>> COME MONDAY, YOU WILL

05:36.966 --> 05:37.900
NO LONGER SEE ONE AMERICA NEWS

05:37.966 --> 05:41.800
ON A CERTAIN SATELLITE PROVIDER,

05:41.866 --> 05:42.433
WHICH I WILL NOT MENTION BECAUSE

05:42.500 --> 05:43.933
I DON'T EVEN LIKE UTTERING THEIR

05:44.000 --> 05:45.333
NAME OUT OF MY MOUTH.

05:45.400 --> 05:47.400
AH, YES, THE HALLMARK

05:47.466 --> 05:49.400
OF A GREAT NEWS NETWORK,

05:49.466 --> 05:52.166
BRINGING YOU HARD HITTING

05:52.233 --> 05:53.200
NEWS STORIES WITHOUT SPECIFICS

05:53.266 --> 05:53.800
BECAUSE THEY MAKE THE ANCHOR

05:53.866 --> 05:55.100
SAD.

05:55.166 --> 05:57.566
JUST SO YOU KNOW, THE PROVIDER

05:57.633 --> 05:59.000
HE'S REFERRING TO IS DIRECT TV,

05:59.066 --> 06:00.966
WHICH IS A SUBSIDIARY OF

06:01.033 --> 06:01.533
A PARENT COMPANY I WILL NOT

06:01.600 --> 06:02.300
MENTION BECAUSE I DON'T EVEN

06:02.366 --> 06:03.166
LIKE UTTERING THEIR NAME

06:03.233 --> 06:05.433
OUT OF MY MOUTH.

06:05.500 --> 06:06.933
INTERESTINGLY, AS OF FRIDAY,

06:07.000 --> 06:09.466
AT&T OFFICIALLY NO LONGER OWNS

06:09.533 --> 06:11.366
US, SO IT'S GOODBYE FROM ME,

06:11.433 --> 06:12.966
BUSINESS DADDY.

06:13.033 --> 06:14.733
LET ME JUST SAY THIS, WHICH IS

06:14.800 --> 06:17.066
FRANKLY TWO MORE BARS THAN

06:17.133 --> 06:20.100
YOU'VE EVER HAD.

06:20.166 --> 06:21.533
AS WE'VE MENTIONED BEFORE, AT&T

06:21.600 --> 06:26.000
WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN OAN'S RISE,

06:26.066 --> 06:26.633
WITH ABOUT 90% OF ITS

06:26.700 --> 06:27.600
REVENUE REPORTEDLY GENERATED

06:27.666 --> 06:28.966
FROM ITS AT&T AND DIRECTV DEALS.

06:29.033 --> 06:29.733
BUT THIS PAST WEEK, OAN WAS

06:29.800 --> 06:32.066
FINALLY DROPPED BY THE PROVIDER,

06:32.133 --> 06:34.500
AND NOT A MOMENT TOO SOON.

06:34.566 --> 06:35.666
ITS COVERAGE OF UKRAINE IN

06:35.733 --> 06:38.866
PARTICULAR HAS BEEN APPALLING,

06:38.933 --> 06:40.466
WITH THIS FUCKING GUY SUGGESTING

06:40.533 --> 06:43.400
THAT THIS BOMBING OF A MATERNITY

06:43.466 --> 06:44.300
HOSPITAL MIGHT HAVE BEEN A HOAX.

06:44.366 --> 06:45.166
>> SO WHAT'S THE MOST RECENT

06:45.233 --> 06:47.066
STORY COOKED UP BY THE AMERICAN

06:47.133 --> 06:49.066
PRAVDA?

06:49.133 --> 06:50.533
WELL, IT TURNS OUT THAT THE

06:50.600 --> 06:52.700
RUSSIANS, DEMOCRATS' FAVORITE

06:52.766 --> 06:54.933
ADVERSARY, BLEW UP A HOSPITAL,

06:55.000 --> 06:55.966
KILLING SEVERAL PEOPLE,

06:56.033 --> 06:58.466
INCLUDING A CHILD.

06:58.533 --> 07:00.566
PERHAPS WAR CRIMES ARE BEING

07:00.633 --> 07:01.566
COMMITTED, PERHAPS CIVILIANS ARE

07:01.633 --> 07:05.100
BEING MURDERED, BUT PERHAPS THEY

07:05.166 --> 07:07.633
AREN'T.

07:07.700 --> 07:11.066
WOW, IT'S PRETTY

07:11.133 --> 07:12.966
MADDENING TO WATCH NEO-FACIST

07:13.033 --> 07:13.500
VIN DIESEL THERE QUESTION

07:13.566 --> 07:14.766
CIVILIAN CASUALTIES WITH THE

07:14.833 --> 07:16.100
TONE OF A STONED TEENAGER

07:16.166 --> 07:18.766
TALKING ABOUT PENGUINS.

07:18.833 --> 07:20.300
"PERHAPS THEY'RE WEARING LITTLE

07:20.366 --> 07:23.400
BIRD TUXEDOS, BUT PERHAPS...

07:23.466 --> 07:25.866
THEY AREN'T."

07:25.933 --> 07:27.466
NOW, LOSING DISTRIBUTION ON

07:27.533 --> 07:29.233
DIRECTV IS CLEARLY A BIG BLOW TO

07:29.300 --> 07:31.766
OAN, AND THEY'RE NOT GOING OUT

07:31.833 --> 07:33.066
WITHOUT A FIGHT, AS THEIR OWNERS

07:33.133 --> 07:35.300
ARE CURRENTLY SUING AT&T AND

07:35.366 --> 07:39.400
DIRECT TV FOR $1 BILLION.

07:39.466 --> 07:40.866
CLAIMING AT ONE POINT IN THE

07:40.933 --> 07:43.033
SUIT THAT AT&T BREACHED A

07:43.100 --> 07:44.066
"NON-DISPARAGEMENT PROVISION" IN

07:44.133 --> 07:45.433
THEIR CONTRACT, BECAUSE SHOWS

07:45.500 --> 07:47.233
THE COMPANY OWNED HAD BEEN

07:47.300 --> 07:49.033
CRITICAL OF THEM.

07:49.100 --> 07:51.466
AND HERE'S WHERE THINGS GET FUN.

07:51.533 --> 07:52.300
BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT, WE'RE

07:52.366 --> 07:54.600
ACTUALLY IN THE LAWSUIT.

07:54.666 --> 07:56.033
IT CITES A NUMBER OF THINGS I

07:56.100 --> 07:57.966
SAID ABOUT OAN IN THE PAST,

07:58.033 --> 07:59.766
LIKE THE FACT THEY'RE FOX NEWS

07:59.833 --> 08:01.300
WITH EVEN LESS SHAME AND EVEN

08:01.366 --> 08:02.500
FEWER SCRUPLES AND A RAGTAG

08:02.566 --> 08:05.833
BAND OF FASCISTS WHO ARE HAPPY

08:05.900 --> 08:07.266
TO GIVE A PLATFORM TO BATSHIT

08:07.333 --> 08:08.166
ELECTION FRAUD THEORIES FROM

08:08.233 --> 08:09.966
AMERICA'S MOST OUT-OF-BREATH

08:10.033 --> 08:11.700
PILLOW FETISHIST.

08:11.766 --> 08:13.366
AND WHILE I'M HAPPY TO HAVE SAID

08:13.433 --> 08:15.033
ALL OF THOSE, I CAN'T BELIEVE

08:15.100 --> 08:17.500
THEY LEFT OUT THE FACT THAT I

08:17.566 --> 08:20.700
ALSO CALLED THIS GUY DECAF

08:20.766 --> 08:21.833
PITBULL JUST LAST YEAR, AND

08:21.900 --> 08:23.100
FRANKLY, I WANT THAT ENTERED

08:23.166 --> 08:25.833
INTO THE LEGAL RECORD.

08:25.900 --> 08:27.366
AND LOOK, I DO GET THEY'RE

08:27.433 --> 08:28.633
UPSET.

08:28.700 --> 08:29.933
JUST AS I GET THEY'RE AN

08:30.000 --> 08:31.100
INTELLECTUALLY BANKRUPT

08:31.166 --> 08:32.233
ORGANIZATION, FULL OF

08:32.300 --> 08:33.166
OPPORTUNISTIC GRIFTERS, WHO'VE

08:33.233 --> 08:33.833
DONE NOTHING BUT MAKE THIS

08:33.900 --> 08:35.466
COUNTRY A WORSE PLACE.

08:35.533 --> 08:36.700
BUT PERHAPS THIS ISN'T THE TIME

08:36.766 --> 08:37.833
FOR THAT.

08:37.900 --> 08:40.300
AND PERHAPS I'M SORRY FOR TAKING

08:40.366 --> 08:41.900
JOY IN THEIR MISFORTUNE AND

08:41.966 --> 08:45.166
KICKING THEM WHEN THEY'RE DOWN.

08:45.233 --> 08:47.333
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND

08:47.400 --> 08:49.766
PERHAPS I'M NOT.

08:49.833 --> 08:55.666
AND NOW THIS.

08:55.733 --> 08:56.700
AND NOW THINGS

08:56.766 --> 08:59.733
GET UNCOMFORTABLE ON LOCAL NEWS

08:59.800 --> 09:02.200
THANKS TO A TERRIBLE HOLIDAY.

09:02.266 --> 09:04.366
>> ALLEGEDLY ITS NATIONAL HUG

09:04.433 --> 09:06.233
"E! NEWS" PERSON DAY.

09:08.966 --> 09:17.266
>> TODAY IS NATIONAL HUG A NEWS

09:20.200 --> 09:23.533
>> JACKIE IS THERE ANYONE YOU

09:23.600 --> 09:25.166
WANT TO GIVE A HUG TOO?

09:25.233 --> 09:28.866
>> I HATE HUG SO MUCH.

09:28.933 --> 09:33.966
I HATE HUGS SO MUCH.

09:34.033 --> 09:35.833
TODAY IS NATIONAL HUG A NEWS

09:35.900 --> 09:36.166
PERSON DAY.

09:36.233 --> 09:39.200
>> DON'T COME UP AND HUG

09:39.266 --> 09:39.466
SOMEBODY.

09:39.533 --> 09:40.800
>> I DON'T KNOW YOU.

09:40.866 --> 09:41.933
>> YOU MADE THAT UP.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.400
>> I DID NOT MAKE THAT OUT.

09:44.466 --> 09:47.166
>> WHERE DID YOU FIND IT?

09:47.233 --> 09:48.966
SOME BOGUS WEBSITE?

09:49.033 --> 09:50.366
>> WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

09:50.433 --> 09:54.533
>> I AM WARMING UP MY HUGGING

09:54.600 --> 09:56.533
MUSCLES.

09:56.600 --> 10:01.133
JUSTIN GOT ONE LAST HOUR.

10:01.200 --> 10:02.133
MOVING ON.

10:02.200 --> 10:05.700
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

10:05.766 --> 10:07.566
COMPUTERS.

10:07.633 --> 10:08.200
THERE'S ONE IN MY HOUSE, ONE IN

10:08.266 --> 10:08.833
MY POCKET AND ONE ON MY WRIST,

10:08.900 --> 10:11.100
AND, FUN FACT, IF THEY ALL BROKE

10:11.166 --> 10:12.666
AT THE SAME TIME, I'D DIE!

10:12.733 --> 10:13.466
MORE SPECIFICALLY, WE'RE GOING

10:13.533 --> 10:14.033
TO TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT

10:14.100 --> 10:14.666
WE'VE ALL HAD UNSETTLING MOMENTS

10:14.733 --> 10:15.433
WHEN IT BECAME CLEAR THAT OUR

10:15.500 --> 10:16.000
COMPUTER WAS MONITORING OUR

10:16.066 --> 10:16.633
ACTIVITIES A LITTLE MORE CLOSELY

10:16.700 --> 10:18.500
THAN WE MIGHT LIKE.

10:18.566 --> 10:20.833
>> AFTER FINANCIAL PLANNER

10:20.900 --> 10:22.333
ROD LAURENZ OPENED A NEW OFFICE,

10:22.400 --> 10:23.166
HE USED A CREDIT CARD

10:23.233 --> 10:24.266
TO BUY BABY WIPES TO

10:24.333 --> 10:25.733
CLEAN THE PLACE.

10:25.800 --> 10:26.766
HE SAYS AFTER PICKING UP

10:26.833 --> 10:28.166
JUST ONE CANISTER, HE WAS

10:28.233 --> 10:30.200
SHOCKED TO BE BOMBARDED WITH

10:30.266 --> 10:31.933
TARGETED ONLINE ADS FOR OTHER

10:32.000 --> 10:33.766
BABY WIPES AND MORE CHILDREN'S

10:33.833 --> 10:36.166
PRODUCTS, SOMETHING THIS SINGLE

10:36.233 --> 10:37.433
GUY AROUND TOWN SAYS HE'S

10:37.500 --> 10:39.533
DEFINITELY NOT INTERESTED IN,

10:39.600 --> 10:43.366
AT LEAST NOT NOW.

10:43.433 --> 10:44.300
YES, IT'S TRUE.

10:44.366 --> 10:44.966
POOR ROD GOT ROPED

10:45.033 --> 10:45.733
INTO THE MODERN UPDATE

10:45.800 --> 10:48.133
OF HEMINGWAY'S CLASSIC STORY.

10:48.200 --> 10:48.400
"FOR SALE.

10:48.466 --> 10:49.566
BABY SHOES.

10:49.633 --> 10:50.800
CLICK HERE."

10:50.866 --> 10:51.400
AND OF COURSE ROD DIDN'T WANT

10:51.466 --> 10:52.066
THAT SHIT.

10:52.133 --> 10:54.133
HE WAS A MAN ABOUT TOWN!

10:54.200 --> 10:55.400
HE WAS ONLY INTERESTED IN THREE

10:55.466 --> 10:56.366
GETTING LAIDS, GETTING

10:56.433 --> 10:57.500
PAIDS, AND ROCKING THE HELL OUT

10:57.566 --> 11:01.300
OF SOME WRAP-AROUND SHADES.

11:01.366 --> 11:02.433
WE'VE ALL FOUND OURSELVES BEING

11:02.500 --> 11:04.066
TARGETED BY ADS FOR SOMETHING

11:04.133 --> 11:05.300
ODDLY SPECIFIC, AND THOUGHT,

11:05.366 --> 11:06.766
"HOW ON EARTH DID THEY KNOW TO

11:06.833 --> 11:08.000
SHOW ME THAT?"

11:08.066 --> 11:09.566
AND TONIGHT, WE'RE GOING TO TALK

11:10.900 --> 11:13.033
DATA BROKERS.

11:13.100 --> 11:13.633
IT'S A MULTIBILLION-DOLLAR

11:13.700 --> 11:14.733
INDUSTRY, ENCOMPASSING EVERYONE

11:14.800 --> 11:16.700
FROM CREDIT-REPORTING COMPANIES,

11:16.766 --> 11:18.866
TO THESE WEIRD PEOPLE-FINDING

11:18.933 --> 11:20.600
WEBSITES THAT POP UP WHENEVER

11:20.666 --> 11:21.700
YOU GOOGLE THE NAME OF YOUR

11:21.766 --> 11:23.633
FRIEND'S SKETCHY NEW BOYFRIEND,

11:23.700 --> 11:24.866
TO THESE NAMES YOU MAY NEVER

11:24.933 --> 11:27.166
HAVE HEARD OF.

11:27.233 --> 11:28.633
BUT WHAT ALL THESE COMPANIES

11:28.700 --> 11:29.900
HAVE IN COMMON IS, THEY COLLECT

11:29.966 --> 11:30.500
YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION AND

11:30.566 --> 11:31.933
THEN RESELL OR SHARE IT WITH

11:32.000 --> 11:33.733
OTHERS.

11:33.800 --> 11:35.066
AS ONE EXPERT PUTS IT, THEY'RE

11:35.133 --> 11:35.900
THE "MIDDLEMEN OF SURVEILLANCE

11:35.966 --> 11:37.766
CAPITALISM."

11:37.833 --> 11:38.266
WHICH SOUNDS LIKE BOTH A

11:38.333 --> 11:41.100
HORRIFIC PROFESSION, AND ALSO,

11:41.166 --> 11:42.400
A B-PLUS JAKE GYLLENHAAL

11:42.466 --> 11:43.833
THRILLER.

11:43.900 --> 11:45.166
HE'S NOT A SPY.

11:45.233 --> 11:45.866
AND HE'S NOT A CIVILIAN.

11:45.933 --> 11:46.700
HE'S...

11:46.766 --> 11:47.833
THE MIDDLE MAN.

11:47.900 --> 11:49.966
AND LADIES?

11:50.033 --> 11:52.500
IN THIS ONE, HE SHOWS TRUNK.

11:52.566 --> 11:54.233
AND LOOK, I KNOW IT'S NOT NEWS

11:54.300 --> 11:55.600
THAT YOU GET TRACKED ONLINE.

11:55.666 --> 11:57.200
IN FACT, ROUGHLY SIX IN TEN U.S.

11:57.266 --> 11:58.966
ADULTS SAY THEY DON'T THINK IT'S

11:59.033 --> 12:00.366
POSSIBLE TO GO THROUGH DAILY

12:00.433 --> 12:01.400
LIFE WITHOUT HAVING DATA

12:01.466 --> 12:02.500
COLLECTED ABOUT THEM BY

12:02.566 --> 12:04.833
COMPANIES OR THE GOVERNMENT.

12:04.900 --> 12:05.433
MAKING FOUR OUT OF TEN U.S.

12:05.500 --> 12:08.833
ADULTS EMBARRASSINGLY WRONG.

12:08.900 --> 12:10.900
BUT THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT THE

12:10.966 --> 12:12.666
- CONVENIENCE AND/
- OR IRRITATION OF

12:12.733 --> 12:13.900
TARGETED ADS.

12:13.966 --> 12:15.566
DATA BROKERS OPERATE IN A

12:15.633 --> 12:17.366
SPRAWLING, UNREGULATED

12:17.433 --> 12:18.133
ECOSYSTEM, WHICH CAN GET VERY

12:18.200 --> 12:21.266
CREEPY VERY FAST.

12:21.333 --> 12:23.100
>> THE MAJOR U.S. RETAILER

12:23.166 --> 12:24.300
OFFICEMAX KNEW NOT ONLY

12:24.366 --> 12:26.033
THAT MIKE SEAY'S DAUGHTER

12:26.100 --> 12:28.300
WAS DEAD BUT HOW SHE DIED.

12:28.366 --> 12:29.633
>> IT SAYS, "MIKE SEAY,

12:29.700 --> 12:31.833
DAUGHTER KILLED IN CAR CRASH

12:31.900 --> 12:33.366
OR CURRENT BUSINESS,"

12:33.433 --> 12:35.666
AND THIS IS MY HOME.

12:35.733 --> 12:36.266
WHY WOULD THEY HAVE THAT KIND

12:36.333 --> 12:39.233
OF INFORMATION?

12:39.300 --> 12:40.066
WHY WOULD THEY NEED THAT?

12:40.133 --> 12:44.866
RIGHT, AND OBVIOUSLY

12:44.933 --> 12:46.066
THAT'S COMPLETELY APPALLING.

12:46.133 --> 12:47.200
BUT I WILL SAY, I'M NOT THAT

12:47.266 --> 12:48.266
SURPRISED OFFICEMAX WAS BEHIND

12:48.333 --> 12:49.066
THAT, AS THEY ARE CLEARLY NOT

12:49.133 --> 12:51.433
ENTIRELY ON TOP OF THEIR SHIT.

12:51.500 --> 12:52.300
IF YOU GOOGLE OFFICEMAX,

12:52.366 --> 12:53.400
THE "PEOPLE ALSO ASK" QUESTIONS

12:53.466 --> 12:54.633
INCLUDE, AND THIS IS TRUE,

12:54.700 --> 12:55.466
"IS OFFICEMAX THE SAME

12:55.533 --> 12:56.733
AS OFFICE DEPOT?"

12:56.800 --> 12:57.466
"IS OFFICEMAX AND STAPLES

12:57.533 --> 12:58.933
THE SAME?"

12:59.000 --> 13:02.700
AND "DOES OFFICEMAX EXIST?"

13:02.766 --> 13:03.733
THE TRUTH IS, WHEN IT COMES TO

13:03.800 --> 13:05.166
DATA BROKERS, THEY KNOW

13:05.233 --> 13:06.333
SIGNIFICANTLY MORE ABOUT YOU

13:06.400 --> 13:07.833
THAN YOU MIGHT LIKE, AND DO

13:07.900 --> 13:08.933
SIGNIFICANTLY MORE WITH IT THAN

13:09.000 --> 13:10.833
YOU MIGHT THINK.

13:10.900 --> 13:12.066
SO TONIGHT LET'S TALK ABOUT THE

13:12.133 --> 13:13.466
WHOLE INDUSTRY.

13:13.533 --> 13:15.000
AND LET'S START WITH HOW YOUR

13:15.066 --> 13:16.366
INFORMATION IS COLLECTED.

13:16.433 --> 13:17.766
BASICALLY EVERY TIME YOU

13:17.833 --> 13:19.400
INTERACT WITH SOCIETY, YOU'RE

13:19.466 --> 13:21.133
LEAVING BREADCRUMBS THAT CAN BE

13:21.200 --> 13:23.033
GATHERED AND SOLD.

13:23.100 --> 13:25.400
AND MUCH OF THIS HAPPENS ONLINE,

13:25.466 --> 13:26.266
THANKS IN LARGE PART TO COOKIES.

13:26.333 --> 13:28.000
COOKIES WERE DEVELOPED IN THE

13:28.066 --> 13:29.666
EARLY DAYS OF THE INTERNET,

13:29.733 --> 13:30.666
AND THEY'RE ACTUALLY ONE OF THE

13:30.733 --> 13:31.600
THINGS THAT MAKE IT SLIGHTLY

13:31.666 --> 13:33.300
BETTER, A DISTINCTION THEY SHARE

13:33.366 --> 13:35.500
WITH HENRY WINKLER'S TWITTER

13:35.566 --> 13:38.466
FEED AND LITERALLY NOTHING ELSE.

13:38.533 --> 13:39.933
WHAT THEY ESSENTIALLY DO IS

13:40.000 --> 13:42.466
ENABLE WEBSITES TO REMEMBER YOU,

13:42.533 --> 13:44.033
THEY'RE WHY AMAZON REMEMBERS

13:44.100 --> 13:45.300
YOU PUT A $106 COMPLETE BOX

13:45.366 --> 13:46.366
SET OF THE MENTALIST IN YOUR

13:46.433 --> 13:48.333
CART AFTER EATING AN

13:48.400 --> 13:49.533
UNEXPECTEDLY STRONG WEED GUMMY,

13:49.600 --> 13:52.000
EVEN IF YOU DON'T.

13:52.066 --> 13:53.033
AND IF THAT'S ALL COOKIES DID,

13:53.100 --> 13:54.933
IT'D BE FINE.

13:55.033 --> 13:56.300
BUT THE PRACTICE GRADUALLY

13:56.366 --> 13:58.100
EVOLVED TO INCLUDE THIRD-PARTY

13:58.166 --> 14:00.500
COOKIES BASICALLY, COMPANIES

14:00.566 --> 14:01.900
OTHER THAN THE SITE THAT YOU'RE

14:01.966 --> 14:03.200
ON, PLANTING A PIECE OF CODE IN

14:03.266 --> 14:05.066
YOUR BROWSER THAT ALLOWS THEM TO

14:05.133 --> 14:06.166
TRACK WHERE ELSE YOU'RE GOING ON

14:06.233 --> 14:07.500
THE INTERNET.

14:07.566 --> 14:08.833
JUST WATCH AS A TECH WRITER

14:08.900 --> 14:10.066
EXPLAINS WHAT THEY FOUND, WHEN

14:10.133 --> 14:11.166
THEY TRIED TO LEARN JUST HOW

14:11.233 --> 14:12.300
MANY COMPANIES WERE TRACKING

14:12.366 --> 14:13.366
THEM.

14:13.433 --> 14:14.366
>> SO I STARTED THE DAY

14:14.433 --> 14:15.766
ON GOOGLE AND DID A SEARCH.

14:15.833 --> 14:16.866
AND NINE TRACKERS

14:16.933 --> 14:17.800
WERE DOWNLOADED

14:17.866 --> 14:19.533
ONTO MY COMPUTER.

14:19.600 --> 14:20.666
>> TRACKERS DO WHAT IT

14:20.733 --> 14:21.100
SOUNDS LIKE THEY DO.

14:21.166 --> 14:22.100
THEY TRACK YOU.

14:22.166 --> 14:24.700
THEY CAN GET MY I.P. ADDRESS

14:24.766 --> 14:26.100
OR THE DEVICE I'M USING

14:26.166 --> 14:27.300
OR THE SCREEN SIZE.

14:27.366 --> 14:28.766
THEY WERE ABLE TO DETERMINE

14:28.833 --> 14:31.000
MY LOCATION VERY PRECISELY.

14:31.066 --> 14:32.500
NEXT, I WENT TO HUFFPO,

14:32.566 --> 14:34.966
AND I WAS SWARMED.

14:35.033 --> 14:36.766
THE TRACKERS KIND OF MULTIPLIED.

14:36.833 --> 14:37.700
THERE WERE DOZENS AND

14:37.766 --> 14:38.300
DOZENS.

14:38.366 --> 14:39.700
AND THEY'RE JUST -- THE TRACKERS

14:39.766 --> 14:41.600
ARE JUST KIND OF, YOU KNOW,

14:41.666 --> 14:43.000
ON MY HEELS AS I GO AROUND

14:43.066 --> 14:44.066
THE WEB.

14:44.133 --> 14:45.400
YEAH, AND I DON'T KNOW

14:45.466 --> 14:46.533
ABOUT YOU, BUT I DON'T WANT

14:46.600 --> 14:47.766
A WHOLE CROWD OF STRANGERS

14:47.833 --> 14:48.966
WATCHING WHAT I SEARCH FOR

14:49.033 --> 14:50.466
ON THE INTERNET.

14:50.533 --> 14:51.900
NOT BECAUSE IT'S GROSS,

14:51.966 --> 14:53.333
BECAUSE IT'S PRIVATE.

14:53.400 --> 14:54.333
PRIVATE DOESN'T HAVE TO MEAN

14:54.400 --> 14:54.900
GROSS.

14:54.966 --> 14:56.333
THERE'S NOTHING GROSS ABOUT

14:56.400 --> 14:58.200
LOOKING UP "ARE THERE ANY

14:58.266 --> 14:59.433
SHOWERHEADS WITH

14:59.500 --> 15:01.800
A 'CONTAINS PULP' OPTION?"

15:01.866 --> 15:02.466
I WOULDN'T WANT IT ALL THE TIME,

15:02.533 --> 15:03.100
I WOULDN'T NEED IT

15:03.166 --> 15:04.066
ALL THE TIME.

15:04.133 --> 15:05.833
THAT'S WHY IT'S AN OPTION.

15:05.900 --> 15:07.533
THE OPTION TO HAVE SOME PULP.

15:07.600 --> 15:09.033
IN THE SHOWER.

15:09.100 --> 15:10.633
IT'S -- CAN I FINISH?

15:10.700 --> 15:11.600
IT'S A NORMAL SHOWER MOST OF

15:11.666 --> 15:13.166
THE TIME BUT OCCASIONALLY I'LL

15:13.233 --> 15:14.500
HAVE THE OPTION TO GET PELTED

15:14.566 --> 15:16.000
WITH SOMETHING THAT'S GOT SOME

15:16.066 --> 15:17.933
HEFT TO IT.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.200
JUST SOME WEIGHTED CHUNKS

15:19.266 --> 15:19.500
OF WHATEVER.

15:19.566 --> 15:19.733
THWOOMP.

15:19.800 --> 15:20.133
THWOOMP.

15:20.200 --> 15:21.466
THWOOMP.

15:21.533 --> 15:22.166
SOMETHING TO WAKE ME UP

15:22.233 --> 15:23.100
AND KEEP ME ON MY TOES.

15:23.166 --> 15:25.700
SOMETIMES I NEED IT,

15:25.766 --> 15:26.633
DON'T CLAIM YOU DON'T.

15:26.700 --> 15:27.533
WE'D ALL LOVE TO PRETEND THAT

15:27.600 --> 15:28.966
THE SUN ONLY RISES IN PEACETIME,

15:29.033 --> 15:29.766
BUT THINGS BEING WHAT THEY ARE

15:29.833 --> 15:31.066
WE FIND OURSELVES AGAIN AT WAR

15:31.133 --> 15:32.266
SO, YEAH, START MY DAY

15:32.333 --> 15:32.800
AND ROCK ME WITH SOME

15:32.866 --> 15:33.600
JUICY BITS.

15:33.666 --> 15:35.066
THAT'S WHAT I WANT.

15:35.133 --> 15:36.466
AND I DON'T WANT ANYONE

15:36.533 --> 15:37.566
WATCHING ME WHEN I SEARCH TO

15:37.633 --> 15:38.166
SEE HOW CLOSE WE ARE TO THAT

15:38.233 --> 15:40.233
TECHNOLOGY EXISTING.

15:40.300 --> 15:42.833
BECAUSE IT'S PRIVATE.

15:42.900 --> 15:44.733
BUT DATA BROKERS OFTEN TAKE ALL

15:44.800 --> 15:46.400
THE BREADCRUMBS THEY'VE GATHERED

15:46.466 --> 15:47.866
ABOUT YOU, PAIR THEM WITH OTHER

15:47.933 --> 15:50.200
DATA THEY CAN OBTAIN, AND THEN

15:50.266 --> 15:53.100
SHARE ALL OF IT WITH BUSINESSES

15:53.166 --> 15:53.633
WHO WANT TO MARKET TO YOU.

15:53.700 --> 15:54.100
AND THEY'LL FRAME THIS

15:54.166 --> 15:55.533
AS A WIN-WIN.

15:55.600 --> 15:56.833
HERE'S HOW EPSILON, ONE OF THE

15:56.900 --> 15:57.600
BIGGEST DATA-BROKER FIRMS,

15:57.666 --> 16:00.066
POSITIONS ITSELF.

16:00.133 --> 16:01.466
>> THIS IS A PERSON.

16:01.533 --> 16:02.800
SO IS THIS.

16:02.866 --> 16:03.900
HERE'S ANOTHER.

16:03.966 --> 16:05.233
AND ANOTHER.

16:05.300 --> 16:05.866
THEY ALL LOOK AND ACT

16:05.933 --> 16:07.633
DIFFERENT BUT PEOPLE ARE

16:07.700 --> 16:09.366
FUNDAMENTALLY THE SAME.

16:09.433 --> 16:11.033
THEY ALL WANT RESPECT,

16:11.100 --> 16:12.000
PROTECTION, AND AN EASIER TIME

16:12.066 --> 16:13.133
GETTING THE THINGS

16:13.200 --> 16:14.200
THEY NEED FROM BRANDS.

16:14.266 --> 16:15.033
RIGHT!

16:15.100 --> 16:17.100
THE BIG THREE!

16:17.166 --> 16:18.666
IT'S ALL IN MASLOW'S FAMOUS

16:18.733 --> 16:19.966
HIERARCHY OF NEEDS, PEOPLE WANT

16:20.033 --> 16:21.600
THEIR PHYSIOLOGICAL NEEDS MET,

16:21.666 --> 16:23.266
THEIR SAFETY ACCOUNTED FOR AND

16:23.333 --> 16:25.333
THEIR SEARCH HISTORY HANDED OVER

16:25.400 --> 16:27.766
DIRECTLY TO THE AFLAC DUCK.

16:27.833 --> 16:29.033
EPSILON'S AD EVEN GOES ON TO

16:29.100 --> 16:30.300
SHOW HOW THAT PARTICULAR SERVICE

16:30.366 --> 16:31.666
OF THEIRS WORKS, DEMONSTRATING

16:31.733 --> 16:32.666
HOW THEY CAN CREATE

16:32.733 --> 16:34.000
A CLIENT ID FOR SOMEONE

16:34.066 --> 16:35.266
THAT CONTAINS EVERYTHING

16:35.333 --> 16:35.866
THEY KNOW ABOUT THEM,

16:35.933 --> 16:37.133
LIKE THE FACT THEY'RE A VEGAN

16:37.200 --> 16:39.566
AND MAKE $45,000 TO $50,000

16:39.633 --> 16:41.600
A YEAR, OR THAT THEY'RE

16:41.666 --> 16:43.200
A 41-YEAR-OLD MALE WHO'S MARRIED

16:43.266 --> 16:44.466
WITH KIDS AT HOME AND IS

16:44.533 --> 16:45.933
GOOGLING "SNOW GLOBE STUCK IN

16:46.000 --> 16:48.866
BUTT, WHAT TO DO?"

16:48.933 --> 16:50.033
AND ONCE COMPANIES LIKE EPSILON

16:50.100 --> 16:51.600
COLLECT ENOUGH INFORMATION ABOUT

16:51.666 --> 16:53.233
YOU, THEY CAN SORT YOU INTO

16:53.300 --> 16:54.900
GROUPS.

16:54.966 --> 16:57.366
DATA BROKER FIRMS SELL LISTS

16:57.433 --> 16:58.500
WITH NAMES LIKE "COUPLES WITH

16:58.566 --> 16:59.733
CLOUT," "AMBITIOUS SINGLES,"

16:59.800 --> 17:01.433
"BOOMERS AND BOOMERANGS,"

17:01.500 --> 17:02.200
"POTLUCKS AND THE GREAT

17:02.266 --> 17:03.800
OUTDOORS," "GOLF CARTS AND

17:03.866 --> 17:04.466
GOURMETS," AND "KIDS AND

17:04.533 --> 17:13.566
CABERNET."

17:13.633 --> 17:14.466
THOSE ARE ALL BOTH "REAL NAMES"

17:14.533 --> 17:15.133
OF GROUPS MADE BY DATA BROKERS

17:15.200 --> 17:15.500
"AND" AS OF NOW

17:15.566 --> 17:16.066
IMMEDIATELY-GREENLIT SHOWS

17:16.133 --> 17:18.600
ON TLC.

17:18.666 --> 17:19.600
LOOK, YOU MIGHT NOT CARE IF A

17:19.666 --> 17:20.533
COMPANY WANTS TO TOSS YOUR DATA

17:20.600 --> 17:21.433
IN A GROUP CALLED "KIDS AND

17:21.500 --> 17:23.700
CABERNET" SO THEY CAN MORE

17:23.766 --> 17:25.766
EFFECTIVELY SEND YOU ADS THAT

17:25.833 --> 17:27.700
MAKE YOU SEEM LIKE A BAD MOM IN

17:27.766 --> 17:29.300
A FUN WAY, BUT THERE'S ALSO

17:29.366 --> 17:34.866
A DARK SIDE HERE.

17:34.933 --> 17:36.133
BECAUSE SOME COMPANIES CAN AND

17:36.200 --> 17:37.300
DO DRAW UP EVEN MORE NARROWLY

17:37.366 --> 17:38.233
TARGETED LISTS -- LIKE PEOPLE

17:38.300 --> 17:39.000
WITH CERTAIN AILMENTS, OR SEXUAL

17:39.066 --> 17:39.566
PREFERENCES -- AND THEN SELL

17:39.633 --> 17:40.866
THOSE LISTS TO ANYONE WHO WANTS

17:40.933 --> 17:43.000
TO BUY THEM.

17:43.066 --> 17:44.200
AND WHAT THEY CAN BUY IS PRETTY

17:44.266 --> 17:45.766
TROUBLING.

17:45.833 --> 17:49.066
>> WRAL BOUGHT THOUSANDS OF

17:49.133 --> 17:49.633
NAMES AND ADDRESSES OF LOCAL

17:49.700 --> 17:51.033
PEOPLE WITH SERIOUS ILLNESSES.

17:51.100 --> 17:53.200
THIS GROUP LIVING IN THE

17:53.266 --> 17:55.633
26707 ZIP CODE HAVE DIABETES.

17:55.700 --> 17:57.833
THESE PEOPLE IN 26708 HAVE

17:57.900 --> 18:03.100
CANCER.

18:03.166 --> 18:04.066
THESE RESIDENTS OF 27609

18:04.133 --> 18:05.000
HAVE HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE.

18:05.066 --> 18:05.500
AND ALL OF THESE LOCALS

18:05.566 --> 18:07.300
BATTLE DEPRESSION.

18:07.366 --> 18:09.266
THIS LIST IS MOMS-TO-BE.

18:09.333 --> 18:10.600
>> SO, WE BOUGHT THIS DATA

18:10.666 --> 18:11.966
AND IT TELLS US YOU'RE PREGNANT.

18:12.033 --> 18:13.733
>> YES.

18:13.800 --> 18:15.333
>> AND YOU ARE?

18:15.400 --> 18:15.866
>> I AM.

18:15.933 --> 18:18.566
I AM 18 WEEKS.

18:18.633 --> 18:21.033
THAT'S PRETTY CREEPY.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.066
ISN'T IT?

18:22.133 --> 18:23.200
I HONESTLY DID NOT THINK THERE

18:23.266 --> 18:23.800
COULD BE A WORSE THING TO ASK

18:23.866 --> 18:24.400
A WOMAN YOU DON'T KNOW THAN

18:24.466 --> 18:25.300
'ARE YOU PREGNANT?'

18:25.366 --> 18:26.366
BUT "YOU ARE PREGNANT,

18:26.433 --> 18:27.266
WANNA KNOW WHO I PAID

18:27.333 --> 18:27.933
TO FIND OUT?"

18:28.000 --> 18:30.700
HAS CERTAINLY ENTERED THE CHAT.

18:30.766 --> 18:31.633
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING,

18:31.700 --> 18:32.633
"BUT THAT'S ILLEGAL UNDER HIPAA,

18:32.700 --> 18:33.133
RIGHT?"

18:33.200 --> 18:34.000
WELL, NO.

18:34.066 --> 18:35.300
AS ONE RESEARCHER POINTED OUT,

18:35.366 --> 18:36.900
THE MEDICAL INFORMATION YOU

18:36.966 --> 18:38.500
RELAY TO YOUR PHYSICIAN IS

18:38.566 --> 18:41.000
HIGHLY PROTECTED, BUT IF YOU GO

18:41.066 --> 18:42.466
TO A MEDICAL WEBSITE AND SEARCH

18:42.533 --> 18:44.466
FOR TERMS LIKE HIV OR

18:44.533 --> 18:45.900
ABORTION, THAT INFORMATION IS

18:45.966 --> 18:48.666
NOT PROTECTED AT ALL.

18:48.733 --> 18:50.000
IT'S A SYSTEM THAT SEEMS RIPE

18:50.066 --> 18:52.066
FOR ABUSE, BEFORE YOU LEARN SOME

18:52.133 --> 19:03.566
DATA BROKERS HAVE OFFERED LISTS

19:03.633 --> 19:06.033
SUFFERING SENIORS

19:06.100 --> 19:06.566
PAYDAY LOAN CENTRAL --

19:06.633 --> 19:08.333
HISPANIC,

19:08.400 --> 19:09.400
OR EVEN HELP NEEDED, I AM 90

19:09.466 --> 19:10.333
DAYS BEHIND ON BILLS.

19:10.400 --> 19:11.066
AND SOME IN THE INDUSTRY WILL

19:11.133 --> 19:11.833
INSIST THEY'D NEVER PUT PEOPLE

19:11.900 --> 19:12.733
AT RISK BY SELLING THEIR DATA.

19:12.800 --> 19:13.500
REMEMBER EPSILON, THE COMPANY

19:13.566 --> 19:14.133
THAT COLLECTS CLOUDS OF

19:14.200 --> 19:14.733
INFORMATION ABOUT YOU?

19:14.800 --> 19:15.500
IN 2014, THEIR THEN CEO EVEN

19:15.566 --> 19:17.133
WENT ON "60 MINUTES,"

19:17.200 --> 19:17.700
TO REASSURE PEOPLE THAT HIS

19:17.766 --> 19:20.566
BUSINESS, IN PARTICULAR,

19:20.633 --> 19:21.333
OPERATED IN A COMPLETELY

19:21.400 --> 19:22.700
ABOVE-BOARD MANNER.

19:22.766 --> 19:23.733
>> IF THERE ARE ABUSES OUT

19:23.800 --> 19:25.066
THERE, WE DON'T BELIEVE THOSE

19:25.133 --> 19:26.366
HAPPEN WITHIN OUR COMPANY.

19:26.433 --> 19:27.300
AND WE WOULD BE THE FIRST TO

19:27.366 --> 19:28.000
RAISE OUR HAND.

19:28.066 --> 19:29.566
OH, REALLY?

19:29.633 --> 19:31.700
YOU'D BE THE FIRST TO RAISE YOUR

19:31.766 --> 19:32.066
HAND, WOULD YOU?

19:32.133 --> 19:35.600
THAT'S INTERESTING.

19:35.666 --> 19:36.966
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE LAST YEAR,

19:37.033 --> 19:38.000
EPSILON SETTLED WITH THE DOJ FOR

19:38.066 --> 19:39.433
$150 MILLION FOR FACILITATING

19:39.500 --> 19:40.833
ELDER FRAUD SCHEMES, AFTER

19:40.900 --> 19:43.033
ADMITTING THAT IT SOLD MORE THAN

19:43.100 --> 19:44.633
30 MILLION CONSUMERS' DATA TO

19:44.700 --> 19:46.966
CLIENTS WHO EMPLOYEES KNEW WERE

19:47.033 --> 19:48.333
CARRYING OUT SCAMS.

19:48.400 --> 19:48.866
AND THEY WERE DOING IT FOR

19:48.933 --> 19:49.500
NEARLY A DECADE.

19:49.566 --> 19:50.566
SO I GUESS THAT GUY REALLY

19:50.633 --> 19:52.566
SHOULD'VE BEEN DOING THAT ENTIRE

19:52.633 --> 19:53.366
INTERVIEW WITH HIS

19:53.433 --> 19:56.300
FUCKING HAND IN THE AIR.

19:56.366 --> 19:57.133
AND AT THIS POINT, YOU MAY BE

19:57.200 --> 19:59.700
THINKING, "OKAY.

19:59.766 --> 20:00.566
I THINK I GET IT.

20:00.633 --> 20:01.466
I'M SUFFICIENTLY CREEPED OUT,

20:01.533 --> 20:02.100
THERE IS NOTHING MORE YOU NEED

20:02.166 --> 20:04.233
TO TELL ME."

20:04.300 --> 20:06.166
HOLD ON.

20:06.233 --> 20:07.100
WHAT ABOUT THE FACT THAT

20:07.166 --> 20:08.166
APPS ON YOUR PHONE CAN GIVE AWAY

20:08.233 --> 20:08.933
YOUR EXACT LOCATION TO THIRD

20:09.000 --> 20:09.533
PARTIES, SOMETIMES WITHOUT YOU

20:09.600 --> 20:13.066
KNOWING IT?

20:13.133 --> 20:14.166
THIS FREE FLASHLIGHT APP SETTLED

20:14.233 --> 20:15.100
WITH THE FTC FOR DOING JUST

20:15.166 --> 20:16.500
THAT.

20:16.566 --> 20:18.166
AND THEY'RE NOT ALONE.

20:18.233 --> 20:19.733
TAKE LIFE 360, AN APP GIVING

20:19.800 --> 20:21.100
FAMILIES THE OPPORTUNITY TO KEEP

20:21.166 --> 20:22.733
TRACK OF ONE ANOTHER.

20:22.800 --> 20:24.100
YOU MAY'VE SEEN THEIR ADS

20:24.166 --> 20:25.433
FEATURING PARENTS LOOKING

20:25.500 --> 20:26.933
RELIEVED BECAUSE THEY CAN SEE

20:27.000 --> 20:28.800
WHERE THEIR KIDS ARE GOING AND

20:28.866 --> 20:30.300
KNOW WHEN THEY'VE SAFELY REACHED

20:30.366 --> 20:32.666
THEIR DESTINATION.

20:32.733 --> 20:33.600
WELL, GUESS WHAT?

20:33.666 --> 20:35.133
>> A NEW REPORT FROM THE WEBSITE

20:35.200 --> 20:36.700
THE MARKUP SAYS THAT LIFE360

20:36.766 --> 20:37.466
SELLS ITS LOCATION DATA TO ABOUT

20:37.533 --> 20:38.233
A DOZEN DIFFERENT BROKERS

20:38.300 --> 20:38.900
WHO THEN SELL IT

20:38.966 --> 20:42.566
TO MARKETERS.

20:42.633 --> 20:43.600
YEAH, IT TURNS OUT THEY

20:43.666 --> 20:45.166
WERE SELLING LOCATION DATA TO

20:45.233 --> 20:46.900
AROUND TWELVE DIFFERENT BROKERS.

20:46.966 --> 20:48.533
IT'S LIKE THOSE OLD COMMERCIALS.

20:48.600 --> 20:49.200
IT'S 10:00.

20:49.266 --> 20:49.866
DO YOU KNOW WHERE YOUR CHILDREN

20:49.933 --> 20:53.000
ARE?

20:53.066 --> 20:56.600
'CAUSE IF SO, SAME.

20:56.666 --> 20:57.533
AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU LIFE360

20:57.600 --> 20:58.800
INSISTS THEY'RE NO LONGER DOING

20:58.866 --> 21:00.300
THAT, AND THAT ANYWAY, THEY'D

21:00.366 --> 21:01.966
"DE-IDENTIFIED" THEIR USERS'

21:02.033 --> 21:03.300
DATA BEFORE SELLING IT.

21:03.366 --> 21:05.200
THAT LAST CLAIM IS ACTUALLY VERY

21:05.266 --> 21:06.600
COMMON AMONG BOTH DATA BROKERS

21:06.666 --> 21:08.000
AND THE COMPANIES THEY WORK

21:08.066 --> 21:09.333
WITH, AND IT'S WORTH TAKING

21:09.400 --> 21:10.466
A LOOK AT.

21:10.533 --> 21:13.100
BUT WHILE IT SOUNDS REASSURING,

21:13.166 --> 21:14.500
THE TRUTH IS, IT CAN BE

21:14.566 --> 21:15.500
INCREDIBLY EASY TO FIND OUT

21:15.566 --> 21:17.966
WHO'S BEHIND A NUMBER OR A CODE.

21:18.033 --> 21:19.533
ONE TEAM OF RESEARCHERS EVEN

21:19.600 --> 21:22.166
FOUND THAT 99.98% OF AMERICANS

21:22.233 --> 21:24.533
WOULD BE CORRECTLY RE-IDENTIFIED

21:24.600 --> 21:26.933
IN ANY DATA SET USING JUST

21:27.000 --> 21:28.533
15 DEMOGRAPHIC ATTRIBUTES, AMONG

21:28.600 --> 21:29.366
THEM AGE, GENDER, AND MARITAL

21:29.433 --> 21:31.400
STATUS.

21:31.466 --> 21:32.866
AND THE EASE OF DE-ANONYMIZING

21:32.933 --> 21:33.666
DATA IS SOMETHING WE'VE ACTUALLY

21:33.733 --> 21:36.466
KNOWN ABOUT FOR YEARS.

21:36.533 --> 21:37.666
>> IN 2006, AOL TURNED OVER A

21:37.733 --> 21:39.500
BUNCH OF THESE ANONYMIZED SEARCH

21:39.566 --> 21:40.100
RECORDS OF THEIR USERS TO THE

21:40.166 --> 21:41.600
PUBLIC, AND IT ONLY TOOK A FEW

21:41.666 --> 21:43.200
SHORT HOURS FOR A REPORTER TO

21:43.266 --> 21:46.033
DECODE WHO USER NUMBER NUMBER

21:46.100 --> 21:48.300
4417749 WAS.

21:48.366 --> 21:49.633
BETWEEN SEARCHES FOR THINGS

21:49.700 --> 21:50.400
LIKE NUMB FINGERS, 60s SINGLE

21:50.466 --> 21:51.633
MEN, AND DOG THAT URINATES

21:51.700 --> 21:53.166
ON EVERYTHING, THE REPORTER

21:53.233 --> 21:54.366
UNCOVERED A WOMAN NAMED

21:54.433 --> 21:55.966
THELMA ARNOLD.

21:56.033 --> 21:57.433
SHE WAS AGE 62.

21:57.500 --> 21:59.600
OKAY, I'M NOT SAYING

21:59.666 --> 22:00.866
IT'S AT ALL PLEASANT THAT THAT

22:00.933 --> 22:01.733
HAPPENED, BUT FOR THE RECORD

22:01.800 --> 22:03.033
I AM GLAD THAT IT INTRODUCED ME

22:03.100 --> 22:05.233
TO THELMA ARNOLD.

22:05.300 --> 22:07.300
BECAUSE I LOVE THAT WOMAN.

22:07.366 --> 22:08.833
SHE HASN'T GIVEN UP DESPITE HER

22:08.900 --> 22:10.200
NUMB FINGERS, LACKLUSTER LOVE

22:10.266 --> 22:13.033
LIFE, AND UTTERLY BROKEN DOG.

22:13.100 --> 22:14.733
NONE OF THAT'S STOPPING HER FROM

22:14.800 --> 22:15.833
SHOOTING HER SHOT AND LOOKING

22:15.900 --> 22:18.633
FOR SINGLE MEN IN HER AREA.

22:18.700 --> 22:19.466
WE STAN A MIDDLE-AGED QUEEN WITH

22:19.533 --> 22:21.833
STAMINA.

22:21.900 --> 22:26.700
AS WE LOOKED INTO THIS STORY, WE

22:26.766 --> 22:27.900
CONSTANTLY GOT REMINDERS THAT

22:27.966 --> 22:29.000
NONE OF US ARE REALLY ANONYMOUS

22:29.066 --> 22:29.333
ONLINE.

22:29.400 --> 22:29.933
AT ONE POINT, A RESEARCHER

22:30.000 --> 22:30.600
CLICKED ON THIS COMPANY'S

22:30.666 --> 22:31.833
WEBSITE -- DIDN'T DO ANYTHING

22:31.900 --> 22:32.733
ELSE, JUST WENT THERE ON HIS

22:32.800 --> 22:34.733
BROWSER -- AD LATER THAT DAY,

22:34.800 --> 22:36.466
GOT THIS EMAIL, SAYING THEY KNEW

22:36.533 --> 22:38.200
HE VISITED, AND THAT, "WE OFFER

22:38.266 --> 22:39.833
A PRETTY COOL SERVICE CALLED

22:39.900 --> 22:41.833
WEBSITE VISITOR IDENTIFICATION,

22:41.900 --> 22:42.600
WHICH HELPS BRANDS IDENTIFY

22:42.666 --> 22:44.566
WHO'S BROWSING THEIR WEBSITE.

22:44.633 --> 22:46.600
IN FACT, IT'S HOW WE KNEW HOW TO

22:46.666 --> 22:49.266
SEND YOU THIS QUICK EMAIL!"

22:49.333 --> 22:49.866
WHICH IS JUST OBJECTIVELY

22:49.933 --> 22:51.266
UNSETTLING.

22:51.333 --> 22:53.133
I DON'T WANT ANYONE TRACKING

22:53.200 --> 22:54.466
WHAT MY STAFF MEMBERS ARE DOING

22:54.533 --> 22:56.033
ONLINE, MAINLY BECAUSE I DON'T

22:56.100 --> 22:57.533
WANT TO KNOW HOW MANY OF THEM

22:57.600 --> 22:59.366
HAVE LOOKED UP "WHAT IS JOHN

22:59.433 --> 23:01.700
OLIVER LIKE?"

23:01.766 --> 23:03.700
AND IT'S NOT LIKE DATA BROKERS

23:03.766 --> 23:05.333
ARE SUPER-CAREFUL ABOUT WHO GETS

23:05.400 --> 23:07.500
YOUR SENSITIVE INFORMATION.

23:07.566 --> 23:08.700
YOU'VE ALREADY SEEN A LOCAL NEWS

23:08.766 --> 23:11.333
STATION AMBUSH A PREGNANT WOMAN.

23:11.400 --> 23:13.400
AND A FEW YEARS AGO, CBS BOUGHT

23:13.466 --> 23:15.500
SOME LOCATION DATA FROM BROKERS

23:15.566 --> 23:17.566
AND IT DIDN'T TAKE MUCH FOR THEM

23:17.633 --> 23:19.033
TO FIND OUT WHOSE IT WAS, WHERE

23:19.100 --> 23:20.966
THEY LIVED, AND WHAT THEY WERE

23:21.033 --> 23:21.633
DOING.

23:21.700 --> 23:22.600
>> NO NAMES OR PHONE NUMBERS

23:22.666 --> 23:24.366
WERE TIED TO THE DATA, BUT IT

23:24.433 --> 23:25.966
WAS EASY TO FIGURE OUT WHO

23:26.033 --> 23:26.966
EACH PHONE BELONGS TO BASED ON

23:27.033 --> 23:27.900
WHERE THEY SPEND THEIR NIGHTS

23:27.966 --> 23:29.700
HERE IN GREENWICH.

23:29.766 --> 23:31.200
ONE PHONE PINGED IN THE MORNING

23:31.266 --> 23:33.600
INSIDE A $7 MILLION MANSION.

23:33.666 --> 23:34.733
THE PERSON THEN VISITED

23:34.800 --> 23:36.466
A COUNTRY CLUB BEFORE HEADING

23:36.533 --> 23:38.700
DOWNTOWN AND RETURNING HOME.

23:38.766 --> 23:39.366
YEAH, THAT DOESN'T FEEL

23:39.433 --> 23:40.833
GREAT, DOES IT?

23:40.900 --> 23:42.833
ALTHOUGH THAT PARTICULAR EXAMPLE

23:42.900 --> 23:44.900
ISN'T THAT SURPRISING.

23:44.966 --> 23:45.466
IF YOU TOLD ME AN INDIVIDUAL

23:45.533 --> 23:47.333
WOKE UP IN A $7 MILLION MANSION

23:47.400 --> 23:48.733
IN GREENWICH, CONNECTICUT, AND

23:48.800 --> 23:49.366
MADE ME GUESS WHERE THEY WENT

23:49.433 --> 23:50.333
NEXT, I'D HAVE GONE WITH,

23:50.400 --> 23:55.233
"I DUNNO, A COUNTRY CLUB,

23:55.300 --> 23:56.266
DOWNTOWN TO HUNT HUMANS FOR

23:56.333 --> 23:57.800
SPORT, AND THEN HOME AGAIN."

23:57.866 --> 23:59.133
AND I'D BE PRETTY SURE I WAS

23:59.200 --> 24:01.033
RIGHT.

24:01.100 --> 24:01.633
AND THE THING IS, THAT KIND OF

24:01.700 --> 24:03.066
IDENTIFYING INFORMATION CAN

24:03.133 --> 24:04.833
CAUSE HUGE PROBLEMS.

24:04.900 --> 24:06.366
JUST LAST YEAR A PRIEST WAS

24:06.433 --> 24:08.000
FORCED TO RESIGN AFTER A

24:08.066 --> 24:09.400
CATHOLIC NEWSLETTER SAID IT USED

24:09.466 --> 24:11.466
APP DATA SIGNALS FROM GRINDR TO

24:11.533 --> 24:13.266
MONITOR HIS ACTIVITY, AND

24:13.333 --> 24:13.900
MATCHING HIS PHONE TO HIS

24:13.966 --> 24:15.766
RESIDENCE, ESSENTIALLY OUTING

24:15.833 --> 24:17.900
HIM, WHICH IS A MASSIVE, HARMFUL

24:17.966 --> 24:19.266
INVASION OF PRIVACY, AND

24:19.333 --> 24:21.333
DEFINITELY THE WORST SCANDAL

24:21.400 --> 24:25.066
EVER TO HIT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH.

24:25.133 --> 24:26.266
ALSO, QUICK SIDE NOTE HERE.

24:26.333 --> 24:27.233
CATHOLIC CHURCH, ARE YOU

24:27.300 --> 24:28.933
ABSOLUTELY SURE JESUS WAS

24:29.033 --> 24:30.733
HOMOPHOBIC?

24:30.800 --> 24:31.866
THINK ABOUT IT.

24:31.933 --> 24:32.733
HE HAD MUTUALLY RESPECTFUL

24:32.800 --> 24:33.833
FRIENDSHIPS WITH WOMEN,

24:33.900 --> 24:35.133
A DISTANT RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS

24:35.200 --> 24:37.633
FATHER, AND WHEN HE FOUND OUT HE

24:37.700 --> 24:38.166
WAS GOING TO BE BETRAYED,

24:38.233 --> 24:39.000
HE INVITED EVERYONE TO

24:39.066 --> 24:41.833
A CONFRONTATIONAL DINNER.

24:41.900 --> 24:43.066
IT MIGHT BE WORTH RE-EXAMINING

24:43.133 --> 24:44.900
YOUR THESIS.

24:46.500 --> 24:47.566
"I DON'T CARE ABOUT THIS.

24:47.633 --> 24:49.466
MY LIFE'S AN OPEN BOOK, I HAVE

24:49.533 --> 24:50.533
NO SECRETS, SO DATA BROKERS CAN

24:50.600 --> 24:52.233
HAVE AT IT."

24:52.300 --> 24:54.766
EVEN IF THAT'S TRUE FOR YOU,

24:54.833 --> 24:56.500
CONSIDER THERE ARE OTHERS OUT

24:56.566 --> 24:57.800
THERE WHO MIGHT HAVE VERY GOOD

24:57.866 --> 25:00.800
REASONS TO NOT WANT TO BE FOUND.

25:00.866 --> 25:01.400
>> DONNA IS A DOMESTIC

25:01.466 --> 25:02.766
VIOLENCE VICTIM.

25:02.833 --> 25:04.300
WE'RE PROTECTING HER IDENTITY.

25:04.366 --> 25:05.366
ONE OF HER ADDRESSES CAME UP

25:05.433 --> 25:07.133
ON A DATA BROKER SITE.

25:07.200 --> 25:09.433
SHE SAYS THAT'S FRIGHTENING.

25:09.500 --> 25:11.766
>> IF YOU HAVE SOMEONE THAT'S

25:11.833 --> 25:13.800
TRIED TO KILL YOU, FOR THEM TO

25:13.866 --> 25:15.066
BE ABLE TO JUST TYPE IN

25:15.133 --> 25:16.833
YOUR NAME AND ANY KNOWN

25:16.900 --> 25:18.733
ADDRESS THAT YOU'VE EVER STAYED

25:18.800 --> 25:22.400
IN CAN POP UP, IT'S SCARY

25:22.466 --> 25:23.933
BECAUSE NOW THEY KNOW WAYS

25:24.000 --> 25:25.133
TO START TRYING TO

25:25.200 --> 25:26.766
FIND YOU.

25:26.833 --> 25:27.500
RIGHT.

25:27.566 --> 25:28.833
AND THAT'S NOT JUST THEORETICAL.

25:28.900 --> 25:30.266
IT'S HAPPENED.

25:30.333 --> 25:32.633
IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, A STALKER

25:32.700 --> 25:33.266
KILLED A FORMER CLASSMATE AFTER

25:33.333 --> 25:33.933
FINDING HER WITH INFORMATION

25:34.000 --> 25:36.033
HE'D BOUGHT FROM A DATA BROKER

25:36.100 --> 25:38.266
FOR $45.

25:38.333 --> 25:39.433
AND IF YOU HAVE A STALKER OR

25:39.500 --> 25:40.600
YOU'RE A VICTIM OF DOMESTIC

25:40.666 --> 25:41.633
VIOLENCE, IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE TO

25:41.700 --> 25:45.066
WANT YOUR INFORMATION REMOVED

25:45.133 --> 25:46.533
FROM THESE PEOPLE SEARCH SITES.

25:46.600 --> 25:47.666
UNFORTUNATELY, EACH HAS ITS OWN

25:47.733 --> 25:49.533
SPECIFIC AND SOMETIMES VERY

25:49.600 --> 25:51.100
COMPLEX PROCESS OF REQUESTING

25:51.166 --> 25:52.666
THE REMOVAL OF INFORMATION.

25:52.733 --> 25:54.400
AND THERE'S NO FEDERAL LAW

25:54.466 --> 25:57.033
REQUIRING THEY HONOR AN OPT-OUT

25:57.100 --> 25:58.133
REQUEST AT ALL.

25:58.200 --> 25:59.366
AND THE LACK OF REGULATION HERE

25:59.433 --> 26:01.566
DOESN'T JUST BENEFIT INDIVIDUALS

26:01.633 --> 26:02.866
WHO MIGHT MEAN YOU HARM.

26:02.933 --> 26:06.866
IT BENEFITS THE GOVERNMENT TOO.

26:06.933 --> 26:07.700
BECAUSE IT GIVES THEM A VERY

26:07.766 --> 26:08.566
ATTRACTIVE LOOPHOLE TO THE

26:08.633 --> 26:09.400
FOURTH AMENDMENT PROTECTION

26:09.466 --> 26:11.333
AGAINST UNREASONABLE SEARCHES

26:11.400 --> 26:12.400
AND SEIZURES.

26:12.466 --> 26:13.200
BECAUSE UNDER THAT, THE

26:13.266 --> 26:15.066
GOVERNMENT NEEDS A WARRANT TO

26:15.133 --> 26:16.233
COLLECT INFORMATION ABOUT YOU

26:16.300 --> 26:18.033
WITHOUT YOUR CONSENT.

26:18.100 --> 26:20.233
BUT IF IT'S NOT FORCING SOMEONE

26:20.300 --> 26:22.000
TO TURN OVER YOUR DATA, IF IT'S

26:22.066 --> 26:23.766
SIMPLY BUYING IT FROM A DATA

26:23.833 --> 26:26.600
BROKER, THAT'S APPARENTLY FINE.

26:26.666 --> 26:28.333
NO WARRANT NECESSARY.

26:28.400 --> 26:29.466
YOU CAN SEE HOW VALUABLE THAT

26:29.533 --> 26:31.266
WOULD BE TO THEM.

26:31.333 --> 26:33.266
IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.

26:33.333 --> 26:34.933
IN FACT, FEDERAL AGENCIES FROM

26:35.000 --> 26:36.300
THE FBI TO I.C.E. HAVE PURCHASED

26:36.366 --> 26:38.100
DATA WITHOUT WARRANTS, PUBLIC

26:38.166 --> 26:39.500
DISCLOSURES, OR ROBUST

26:39.566 --> 26:41.033
OVERSIGHT-TO CARRY OUT

26:41.100 --> 26:45.133
EVERYTHING FROM CRIMINAL

26:45.200 --> 26:46.233
AND THE THING IS, YOU MIGHT NOT

26:46.300 --> 26:47.733
KNOW IF YOUR INFORMATION HAS

26:47.800 --> 26:48.566
BEEN SUPPLIED TO THE GOVERNMENT

26:48.633 --> 26:50.033
BY AN APP.

26:50.100 --> 26:51.833
EVEN THE COMPANY BEHIND THE APP

26:51.900 --> 26:53.533
MIGHT NOT KNOW.

26:53.600 --> 26:54.733
BECAUSE IT MIGHT SELL YOUR INFO

26:54.800 --> 26:56.833
TO A BROKER, WHICH THEN RE-SELLS

26:56.900 --> 26:58.233
IT TO SOMEONE ELSE, WHICH THEN

26:58.300 --> 27:00.033
SUPPLIES IT TO THE GOVERNMENT.

27:00.100 --> 27:00.866
I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE.

27:00.933 --> 27:02.733
A COUPLE YEARS BACK, VICE FOUND

27:02.800 --> 27:04.300
THAT THE APP MUSLIM PRO, WHICH

27:04.366 --> 27:06.633
LET MUSLIMS KNOW WHEN TO PRAY,

27:06.700 --> 27:08.466
HAD BEEN SELLING USER LOCATION

27:08.533 --> 27:10.600
DATA TO A BROKER THAT SUPPLIED

27:10.666 --> 27:11.800
INFORMATION TO THE U.S.

27:11.866 --> 27:12.800
GOVERNMENT.

27:12.866 --> 27:13.666
AND WHILE BECAUSE THE CHAIN IS

27:13.733 --> 27:15.366
SO OPAQUE, IT'S HARD TO KNOW

27:15.433 --> 27:17.000
WHAT EXACTLY WAS SOLD OR WHAT

27:17.066 --> 27:18.666
THE GOVERNMENT DID WITH IT, THE

27:18.733 --> 27:21.000
APP'S USERS WERE UNDERSTANDABLY

27:21.066 --> 27:23.066
PRETTY ALARMED.

27:23.133 --> 27:25.400
>> FEELING DISTURBED, APPALLED,

27:25.466 --> 27:28.766
BUT NOT SURPRISED.

27:28.833 --> 27:29.433
>> SARA MOSTAFAVI USED

27:29.500 --> 27:30.766
MUSLIM PRO.

27:30.833 --> 27:31.766
THAT APP HAS SINCE REPORTEDLY

27:31.833 --> 27:32.800
SEVERED TIES WITH ITS DATA

27:32.866 --> 27:34.200
PARTNERS.

27:34.266 --> 27:35.666
>> SO INTRUSIVE.

27:35.733 --> 27:36.200
YOU KNOW, MY CONVERSATION

27:36.266 --> 27:39.033
WITH GOD IS NOT INFORMATION

27:39.100 --> 27:41.266
THE GOVERNMENT NEEDS.

27:41.333 --> 27:42.033
YEAH, OF COURSE, IT'S

27:42.100 --> 27:43.266
NOT INFORMATION THE GOVERNMENT

27:43.333 --> 27:44.066
NEEDS.

27:44.133 --> 27:45.533
THERE'S A REASON THE BOOK WASN'T

27:45.600 --> 27:47.133
CALLED, "ARE YOU THERE GOD,

27:47.200 --> 27:48.466
IT'S ME MARGARET AND HOMELAND

27:48.533 --> 27:49.533
SECURITY'S ON THE LINE AS WELL,

27:49.600 --> 27:52.333
HOPE THAT'S COOL."

27:52.400 --> 27:53.433
SO TO RECAP HERE.

27:53.500 --> 27:55.500
WE'VE GOT SHADY DATA BROKERS

27:55.566 --> 27:56.266
WITH VIRTUALLY NO OVERSIGHT

27:56.333 --> 27:57.600
COLLECTING YOUR DATA AND

27:57.666 --> 27:59.100
BUILDING PROFILES THAT CAN TRACK

27:59.166 --> 27:59.866
WHO YOU ARE, WHERE YOU ARE AND

27:59.933 --> 28:02.400
WHAT YOU ARE MOST LIKELY TO DO

28:02.466 --> 28:02.633
OR BUY.

28:02.700 --> 28:04.666
YOU CAN'T EDIT THIS DOSSIER, AND

28:04.733 --> 28:06.066
OTHERS, FROM COPS TO REPORTERS

28:06.133 --> 28:07.533
TO YOUR OWN ABUSERS, CAN FIND

28:07.600 --> 28:09.033
AND USE THIS INFORMATION.

28:09.100 --> 28:10.700
IT'S NOT A GREAT SITUATION.

28:10.766 --> 28:16.600
SO WHAT DO WE DO?

28:16.666 --> 28:17.300
WELL, IT IS A BIT TRICKY,

28:17.366 --> 28:18.400
ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE FACT THAT

28:18.466 --> 28:19.166
ENTIRE ECONOMY OF THE INTERNET

28:19.233 --> 28:20.300
RIGHT NOW IS BASICALLY BUILT ON

28:20.366 --> 28:21.700
THIS PRACTICE.

28:21.766 --> 28:23.700
ALL THE FREE STUFF THAT YOU TAKE

28:23.766 --> 28:25.566
FOR GRANTED ONLINE IS ONLY FREE

28:25.633 --> 28:27.833
BECAUSE YOU ARE THE PRODUCT.

28:27.900 --> 28:29.266
THEY MAKE MONEY BY SELLING YOUR

28:29.333 --> 28:31.166
DATA.

28:31.233 --> 28:32.366
BUT EXPERTS SAY THERE ARE SOME

28:32.433 --> 28:33.133
SMALL STEPS THAT YOU CAN

28:33.200 --> 28:34.666
PERSONALLY TAKE.

28:34.733 --> 28:36.333
YOU CAN USE WEB BROWSERS LIKE

28:36.400 --> 28:37.733
THESE TO HELP BETTER PROTECT YOU

28:37.800 --> 28:39.333
AGAINST THIRD-PARTY TRACKING.

28:39.400 --> 28:40.800
AND IF YOU HAVE AN iPHONE, YOU

28:40.866 --> 28:41.966
CAN GO TO THE PRIVACY MENU, HIT

28:42.033 --> 28:43.766
THE TRACKING BUTTON AND TURN OFF

28:43.833 --> 28:45.666
"ALLOW APPS TO REQUEST TO

28:45.733 --> 28:46.766
TRACK."

28:46.833 --> 28:48.966
BUT THIS SHOULDN'T BE YOUR

28:49.033 --> 28:50.166
RESPONSIBILITY.

28:50.233 --> 28:51.600
YOUR PRIVACY SHOULD BE THE

28:51.666 --> 28:53.800
DEFAULT SETTING.

28:53.866 --> 28:54.800
AND THERE SHOULD BE LEGAL FIXES

28:54.866 --> 28:55.433
TO THIS.

28:55.500 --> 28:57.533
OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE TRIED.

28:57.600 --> 28:59.466
THE E.U. PASSED A LAW TO FORCE

28:59.533 --> 29:01.066
SITES TO DISCLOSE COOKIES AND

29:01.133 --> 29:02.833
ALLOW YOU TO OPT OUT.

29:02.900 --> 29:05.233
BUT I WILL SAY COMPANIES NOW

29:05.300 --> 29:06.933
OFTEN CLEVERLY PRESENT THOSE

29:07.000 --> 29:08.200
OPTIONS IN THE MOST ANNOYING WAY

29:08.266 --> 29:09.466
POSSIBLE, WITH "ACCEPT ALL

29:09.533 --> 29:12.633
COOKIES" AN EASY DEFAULT, BUT IF

29:12.700 --> 29:13.500
YOU WANT TO REJECT THEM, FORCING

29:13.566 --> 29:14.900
YOU TO GO THROUGH MULTIPLE

29:14.966 --> 29:16.400
CONFUSING STEPS FOR NO CLEAR

29:16.466 --> 29:18.266
REASON, WHICH IS VERY SMART TO

29:18.333 --> 29:19.833
BE HONEST.

29:19.900 --> 29:21.033
NO ONE'S GOING TO PUT IN THE

29:21.100 --> 29:22.066
WORK TO REJECT COOKIES JUST TO

29:22.133 --> 29:24.400
SNEAK A PEAK AT AN ARTICLE

29:24.466 --> 29:25.566
TITLED "FIVE TIMES ANDREW

29:25.633 --> 29:30.100
GARFIELD JUST WAS."

29:30.166 --> 29:31.066
YOU'D MUCH RATHER HIT "ACCEPT"

29:31.133 --> 29:32.033
AND ENJOY YOUR REMAINING TIME ON

29:32.100 --> 29:32.900
EARTH GAZING AT THE MOST

29:32.966 --> 29:34.866
EMOTIONALLY CONNECTED SPIDERMAN

29:34.933 --> 29:38.200
TO EVER SPLOOGE THE OOZE.

29:38.266 --> 29:40.000
AS FOR HERE IN THE U.S.,

29:40.066 --> 29:41.333
INDIVIDUAL STATES HAVE TRIED TO

29:41.400 --> 29:42.733
LIMIT DATA BROKERS, BUT

29:42.800 --> 29:43.666
ADVOCATES SAY THAT WHAT IS

29:43.733 --> 29:45.133
REALLY NEEDED IS A COMPREHENSIVE

29:45.200 --> 29:47.300
FEDERAL PRIVACY LAW GOVERNING

29:47.366 --> 29:48.966
THEM.

29:49.033 --> 29:49.866
THIS HAS BEEN PROPOSED FOR YEARS

29:49.933 --> 29:51.400
NOW, BUT NOTHING'S HAPPENED,

29:51.466 --> 29:52.600
FOR A COUPLE OF KEY REASONS.

29:52.666 --> 29:54.433
FIRST, DATA BROKER SPENDING ON

29:54.500 --> 29:56.400
LOBBYING IN 2020 RIVALED THAT OF

29:56.466 --> 29:58.433
FACEBOOK AND GOOGLE.

29:58.500 --> 30:00.400
BUT ALSO, POLITICIANS NOW

30:00.466 --> 30:02.466
FAMOUSLY BUILD THEIR CAMPAIGNS

30:02.533 --> 30:04.400
ON DATA OBTAINED FROM BROKERS.

30:04.466 --> 30:05.766
BOTH PARTIES REGULARLY BOAST

30:05.833 --> 30:08.200
ABOUT HOW MUCH THEY USE DATA.

30:08.266 --> 30:09.733
JUST LISTEN TO FORMER RNC CHAIR

30:09.800 --> 30:10.900
REINCE PREIBUS OPENLY BRAGGING

30:10.966 --> 30:13.800
ABOUT IT.

30:13.866 --> 30:15.533
>> EVERYTHING ABOUT ALMOST EVERY

30:15.600 --> 30:17.133
POTENTIAL VOTER IN GEORGIA IS

30:17.200 --> 30:18.300
KNOWN.

30:18.366 --> 30:19.433
AND IT'S NOT EVEN A JOKE,

30:19.500 --> 30:20.433
THEY -- THEY KNOW WHAT BEER THEY

30:20.500 --> 30:21.866
DRINK, WHAT CAR THEY DRIVE,

30:21.933 --> 30:23.033
HOW MANY KIDS THEY HAVE,

30:23.100 --> 30:24.733
AND ALL THAT DATA IS USED

30:24.800 --> 30:26.933
TO TARGET EVERY SINGLE

30:27.000 --> 30:29.133
VOTER IN GEORGIA.

30:29.200 --> 30:30.133
IT'S TRUE.

30:30.200 --> 30:31.400
POLITICIANS RELY ON DATA TO BE

30:31.466 --> 30:33.033
ABLE TO TARGET OUR INTERESTS

30:33.100 --> 30:35.533
WITH PINPOINT PRECISION.

30:35.600 --> 30:36.666
ALTHOUGH THEREFORE I DO WONDER

30:36.733 --> 30:37.900
WHY NO PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE

30:37.966 --> 30:40.100
HAS YET TARGETED ME PERSONALLY

30:40.166 --> 30:41.733
WITH ADS PROMISING TO FIGHT FOR

30:41.800 --> 30:43.700
THE SHOWER OF MORNING CHUNKS

30:43.766 --> 30:45.166
THAT I SO RICHLY DESERVE.

30:45.233 --> 30:46.966
I GOOGLE IT ALL THE TIME, AND

30:47.033 --> 30:49.533
YOU'D HAVE MY VOTE INSTANTLY.

30:49.600 --> 30:50.900
IT'S VERY FRUSTRATING THAT THE

30:50.966 --> 30:52.200
PEOPLE WHO COULD DO SOMETHING

30:52.266 --> 30:53.766
ABOUT DATA BROKERS ARE SO

30:53.833 --> 30:55.900
ACTIVELY INCENTIVIZED NOT TO.

30:55.966 --> 30:57.966
BUT HERE IS WHERE WE MAY BE ABLE

30:58.033 --> 30:59.333
TO HELP.

30:59.400 --> 31:01.366
BECAUSE INTERESTINGLY, THE ONE

31:01.433 --> 31:02.600
TIME THAT CONGRESS HAS ACTED

31:02.666 --> 31:04.433
QUICKLY TO SAFEGUARD PEOPLE'S

31:04.500 --> 31:06.066
PRIVACY WAS IN THE 1980s, WHEN

31:06.133 --> 31:07.933
ROBERT BORK WAS NOMINATED TO THE

31:08.000 --> 31:09.133
SUPREME COURT, AND A REPORTER

31:09.200 --> 31:10.866
WALKED INTO A LOCAL VIDEO STORE

31:10.933 --> 31:12.833
AND ASKED THE MANAGER WHETHER HE

31:12.900 --> 31:14.200
COULD HAVE A PEEK AT BORK'S

31:14.266 --> 31:14.966
VIDEO RENTAL HISTORY,

31:15.033 --> 31:17.266
AND HE GOT IT.

31:17.333 --> 31:19.366
AS SOON AS CONGRESS REALIZED

31:19.433 --> 31:20.400
THERE WAS NOTHING STOPPING

31:20.466 --> 31:21.766
ANYONE FROM RETRIEVING THEIR

31:21.833 --> 31:24.566
VIDEO RENTAL RECORDS TOO,

31:24.633 --> 31:27.066
THEY FREAKED THE FUCK OUT,

31:27.133 --> 31:28.166
AND LO AND BEHOLD,

31:28.233 --> 31:29.466
THE VIDEO PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT

31:29.533 --> 31:30.133
WAS PASSED WITH

31:30.200 --> 31:32.500
QUITE DELIBERATE SPEED.

31:32.566 --> 31:33.966
SO IT SEEMS WHEN CONGRESS' OWN

31:34.033 --> 31:36.433
PRIVACY IS AT RISK, THEY SOMEHOW

31:36.500 --> 31:38.133
FIND A WAY TO ACT.

31:38.200 --> 31:39.700
AND IT ALSO SEEMS LIKE THEY'RE

31:39.766 --> 31:41.733
NOT ENTIRELY AWARE JUST HOW EASY

31:41.800 --> 31:43.433
IT IS FOR ANYONE -- AND I DO

31:43.500 --> 31:45.133
MEAN ANYONE -- TO GET THEIR

31:45.200 --> 31:46.900
PERSONAL INFORMATION,

31:46.966 --> 31:49.600
WHICH BRINGS ME TO ME.

31:49.666 --> 31:50.700
BECAUSE IN RESEARCHING THIS

31:50.766 --> 31:52.066
STORY, WE REALIZED THERE'S ANY

31:52.133 --> 31:54.566
NUMBER OF PERFECTLY LEGAL BITS

31:54.633 --> 31:56.033
OF FUCKERY THAT WE COULD ENGAGE

31:56.100 --> 31:57.066
IN.

31:57.133 --> 31:59.633
WE COULD, FOR EXAMPLE, USE DATA

31:59.700 --> 32:01.100
BROKERS TO GO FISHING FOR

32:01.166 --> 32:02.133
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, BY CREATING

32:02.200 --> 32:04.500
A DEMOGRAPHIC GROUP CONSISTING

32:04.566 --> 32:06.466
OF MEN AGE 45 AND UP, IN A

32:06.533 --> 32:07.866
FIVE-MILE RADIUS OF THE U.S.

32:07.933 --> 32:09.033
CAPITOL, WHO HAD PREVIOUSLY

32:09.100 --> 32:10.700
VISITED SITES REGARDING, OR

32:10.766 --> 32:12.866
SEARCHED FOR TERMS INCLUDING,

32:12.933 --> 32:14.700
DIVORCE, MASSAGE, HAIR LOSS AND

32:14.766 --> 32:16.733
MIDLIFE CRISIS.

32:16.800 --> 32:19.800
WE COULD CALL THAT GROUP

32:19.866 --> 32:21.933
"CONGRESS AND CABERNET," AND

32:22.000 --> 32:24.100
THEN TARGET THAT LIST WITH ADS

32:24.166 --> 32:25.200
THAT MIGHT ATTRACT THOSE MEN TO

32:25.266 --> 32:26.833
CLICK, LIKE,"MARRIAGE SHOULDN'T

32:26.900 --> 32:28.566
BE A PRISON," OR "CAN YOU VOTE

32:28.633 --> 32:32.333
TWICE?"

32:32.400 --> 32:32.933
WE COULD ALSO THROW IN, "DO YOU

32:33.000 --> 32:33.866
WANT TO READ TED CRUZ EROTIC FAN

32:33.933 --> 32:36.500
FICTION?"

32:36.566 --> 32:37.666
JUST TO SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN.

32:37.733 --> 32:39.566
AND IF ANYONE CLICKED, WE'D BE

32:39.633 --> 32:41.266
ABLE TO HARVEST EVEN MORE DATA

32:41.333 --> 32:42.766
FROM THEM, WHICH WE COULD THEN

32:42.833 --> 32:44.700
THEORETICALLY TAKE STEPS TO

32:44.766 --> 32:45.466
DE-ANONYMIZE.

32:45.533 --> 32:47.633
NOW, AM I SAYING THAT WE'RE

32:47.700 --> 32:49.533
ACTUALLY GOING TO DO THAT?

32:49.600 --> 32:50.866
COLLECT ALL THAT RAW INFORMATION

32:50.933 --> 32:53.066
AND STORE IT IN, LET'S SAY,

32:53.133 --> 32:55.233
A MANILA ENVELOPE SOMEWHERE?

32:55.300 --> 32:55.833
WELL, I'M SORRY TO DISAPPOINT

32:55.900 --> 32:56.833
YOU.

32:56.900 --> 32:59.100
WE ARE NOT GOING TO DO THAT.

32:59.166 --> 33:00.633
WHY WOULD WE WHEN WE HAVE

33:00.700 --> 33:02.566
ALREADY DONE IT?

33:02.633 --> 33:07.766
BECAUSE ALL THAT RAW DATA IS

33:07.833 --> 33:09.566
CURRENTLY RIGHT IN HERE.

33:09.633 --> 33:11.333
AND HONESTLY, THIS WHOLE

33:11.400 --> 33:14.700
EXERCISE WAS FUCKING CREEPY.

33:14.766 --> 33:16.166
WE RAN THOSE THREE TARGETED ADS

33:16.233 --> 33:17.366
THIS WEEK IN THE CAPITOL HILL

33:17.433 --> 33:19.200
AREA, AND TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF

33:19.266 --> 33:21.666
JUST HOW MANY CLICKS WE GOT...

33:21.733 --> 33:25.200
IT WAS VERY MUCH NOT ZERO.

33:25.266 --> 33:26.433
DO YOU WANT TO SEE MORE?

33:26.500 --> 33:27.966
BECAUSE SO DO I!

33:28.033 --> 33:34.633
PLEASE COME WITH ME.

33:34.700 --> 33:35.433
LET'S START.

33:35.500 --> 33:36.300
LET'S ME START WITH THE VERY

33:36.366 --> 33:36.866
FIRST HIT WE GOT.

33:36.933 --> 33:38.066
IT CAME AT 3:35 PM ON TUESDAY

33:38.133 --> 33:39.233
AFTERNOON FROM AROUND THE

33:39.300 --> 33:41.100
EMBASSY ROW AREA, WHEN A MAN

33:41.166 --> 33:43.766
FITTING OUR DESCRIPTION CLICKED

33:43.833 --> 33:49.533
ON THE TED CRUZ AD.

33:49.600 --> 33:50.266
MEANING WE NOW HAVE HIS

33:50.333 --> 33:50.866
IP ADDRESS AND DEVICE ID, AND

33:50.933 --> 33:51.566
ALSO KNOW THAT HE DID IT ON AN

33:51.633 --> 33:53.466
ANDROID PHONE.

33:53.533 --> 33:54.066
SO WE COULD NOW TAKE STEPS TO

33:54.133 --> 33:55.700
IDENTIFY HIM.

33:55.766 --> 33:56.300
JUST LIKE WE COULD WITH ALL

33:56.366 --> 33:57.533
THESE OTHERS WHO CLICKED ON ONE

33:57.600 --> 34:02.300
OF OUR ADS IN THE CAPITOL HILL

34:02.366 --> 34:03.633
AREA THIS WEEK, INCLUDING AT

34:03.700 --> 34:04.233
LEAST THREE WHO MAY'VE BEEN

34:04.300 --> 34:04.933
INSIDE THE CAPITOL BUILDING

34:05.000 --> 34:06.200
ITSELF.

34:06.266 --> 34:07.433
ONE OF WHOM CLICKED ON THE

34:07.500 --> 34:08.833
"CAN YOU VOTE TWICE?" AD

34:08.900 --> 34:10.233
ONE OF WHOM CLICKED ON THE

34:10.300 --> 34:11.966
DIVORCE ONE, AND ANOTHER WHO

34:12.033 --> 34:15.433
CLICKED ON THE EROTIC FICTION,

34:15.500 --> 34:16.733
WHICH WAS DISTRESSINGLY POPULAR.

34:16.800 --> 34:17.800
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING,

34:17.866 --> 34:18.933
"HOW ON EARTH

34:19.000 --> 34:19.933
IS ANY OF THIS LEGAL?"

34:20.000 --> 34:21.566
I TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU.

34:21.633 --> 34:24.166
IT SHOULDN'T BE.

34:24.233 --> 34:25.500
AND IF YOU HAPPEN TO BE

34:25.566 --> 34:26.533
A LEGISLATOR WHO'S FEELING

34:26.600 --> 34:28.900
A LITTLE NERVOUS RIGHT NOW ABOUT

34:29.000 --> 34:31.533
WHETHER YOUR INFORMATION IS IN

34:31.600 --> 34:32.933
THIS ENVELOPE AND YOU'RE

34:33.000 --> 34:33.966
TERRIFIED ABOUT WHAT I MIGHT DO

34:34.033 --> 34:35.233
WITH IT, YOU MIGHT WANT TO

34:35.300 --> 34:36.800
CHANNEL THAT WORRY INTO MAKING

34:36.866 --> 34:39.666
SURE THAT I CANNOT ACTUALLY DO

34:39.733 --> 34:42.466
ANYTHING.

34:42.533 --> 34:43.600
ANYWAY, SLEEP WELL.

34:43.666 --> 34:46.400
THAT'S OUR SHOW.

34:46.466 --> 34:47.400
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WATCHING.

34:47.466 --> 34:47.933
WE'LL SEE YOU NEXT WEEK.

34:48.000 --> 34:52.133
GOOD NIGHT!
