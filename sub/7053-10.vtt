ANNOUNCER:
<i>Previously on</i> Fringe...

00:02.157 --> 00:04.462
A storm is coming,
and when it is over,

00:04.497 --> 00:06.464
I fear there will be
little left of our world.

00:07.536 --> 00:08.942
BELL: <i>They are</i>
<i>looking for someone,</i>

00:08.977 --> 00:11.535
someone to open the door
between universes.

00:12.156 --> 00:13.719
Laston-Hennings Cryonics
was hit.

00:13.754 --> 00:14.697
<i>They took everything.</i>

00:14.732 --> 00:16.136
<i>All the cryo-capsules</i>
<i>are gone.</i>

00:16.171 --> 00:17.773
So they found
who they were looking for.

00:18.065 --> 00:20.885
Remember this symbol.
It's hidden on their leader.

00:21.157 --> 00:21.871
<i>That's how</i>
<i>you'll know him.</i>

00:22.101 --> 00:23.570
And if they find him,

00:23.605 --> 00:24.874
<i>there will be</i>
<i>no stopping them,</i>

00:24.942 --> 00:27.844
and that is why
<i>you</i> must find him first.

[crickets chirping]

00:37.588 --> 00:39.719
SLATER:
A girl in a red dress...

00:41.586 --> 00:43.104
Flowers in her hair.

00:43.595 --> 00:45.799
<i>Hmm. What kind</i>
<i>of flowers?</i>

00:47.204 --> 00:49.231
Uh, I'm not sure.

00:49.883 --> 00:52.499
Thank you, Mr. Slater.
It will come.

00:59.221 --> 00:59.814
Heather--

01:01.370 --> 01:03.788
The flowers
in her hair.

01:07.553 --> 01:09.464
The fl--the flowers
in her hair are heather.

01:10.418 --> 01:12.102
Oh, I think so.
Yes.

01:15.680 --> 01:16.292
Container.

01:18.328 --> 01:20.145
Now hold very still.

01:21.632 --> 01:23.685
I assure you
there will be no pain.

[instrument whirring]

01:40.899 --> 01:41.581
Hold on.

01:43.952 --> 01:44.497
Yeah?

01:48.689 --> 01:49.459
We've got activity.

02:09.243 --> 02:11.071
We have two minutes,
maybe three.

02:12.636 --> 02:14.025
Oh, my sincere
apologies.

02:14.060 --> 02:15.913
I--I'd rather not leave you
in such a state.

02:30.132 --> 02:31.448
[tires squeal]

02:35.906 --> 02:37.518
Mr. S-Slater?

02:44.548 --> 02:45.616
Help me.

03:00.034 --> 03:04.008
"Grey Matters"

03:10.958 --> 03:13.109
Special Agent Olivia Dunham
with the FBI.

03:13.177 --> 03:14.577
These two men
are consultants--

03:14.645 --> 03:16.520
Peter Bishop
and Dr. Walter Bishop.

03:16.696 --> 03:17.999
We're here to investigate
the break-in.

03:21.084 --> 03:22.447
And you're Dr. Bishop?

03:22.667 --> 03:23.383
Yes.

03:24.694 --> 03:26.222
And I'm perfectly sane.

03:33.603 --> 03:35.440
Joseph Slater has been
a patient here

03:35.475 --> 03:36.755
for the last 14 years.

03:36.900 --> 03:38.334
When he was admitted,
he was diagnosed

03:38.402 --> 03:40.061
with acute paranoid
schizophrenia.

03:40.096 --> 03:42.071
His file said that
he suffered from delusions,

03:42.139 --> 03:44.390
false memories,
severe emotional swings.

03:44.425 --> 03:46.262
Every classical symptom
of the condition--

03:46.297 --> 03:47.243
He exhibited each one.

03:47.311 --> 03:49.312
- Until last night.
WOMAN: <i>That's right.</i>

03:50.010 --> 03:51.504
And within an hour,
after discovering

03:51.539 --> 03:52.615
what had been done
to Mr. Slater,

03:52.683 --> 03:55.051
the change in his behavior
is nothing short of remarkable.

03:55.358 --> 03:57.587
So basically,
two guys broke in,

03:57.654 --> 04:00.267
cut a big hole in his head
and did what, drove him sane?

04:00.302 --> 04:02.426
As unlikely
as it sounds, yes.

04:02.461 --> 04:04.864
And just as strange,
we can't find evidence

04:04.899 --> 04:05.962
<i>that they did anything</i>
<i>to him.</i>

04:06.557 --> 04:09.273
Mr. Slater's brain
is structurally intact.

04:09.466 --> 04:11.751
We ran blood tests,
tox screens--

04:11.786 --> 04:13.168
<i>Nothing came back</i>
<i>unusual.</i>

04:13.270 --> 04:15.157
We'll need to see
his medical reports.

04:15.564 --> 04:16.947
<i>And also</i>
<i>his personal history.</i>

04:16.983 --> 04:18.101
WOMAN: <i>Of course.</i>
MAN: <i>Aah!</i>

04:19.285 --> 04:19.999
WOMAN [in distance]:
<i>Oh, boy.</i>

04:20.606 --> 04:21.990
<i>Everything's</i>
<i>gonna be okay.</i>

04:22.693 --> 04:24.713
Doctor, I'd like to see
the patient.

04:25.637 --> 04:26.914
That's where we're going
right now, Walter,

04:26.949 --> 04:27.850
to see Mr. Slater.

04:28.309 --> 04:30.765
Peter, we're going to see
a sane man.

04:31.447 --> 04:33.802
I'd like to see him
when he was a <i>patient.</i>

04:34.898 --> 04:38.130
<i>No, no, no, the girl</i>
<i>in the red dress...</i>

04:40.097 --> 04:41.986
<i>Chrysanthemums</i>
<i>in her hair.</i>

04:42.399 --> 04:46.022
<i>Her mother grows them in a box</i>
<i>on the window sill.</i>

04:46.783 --> 04:48.549
<i>And where does</i>
<i>this little girl live?</i>

04:49.352 --> 04:50.303
<i>Across the street.</i>

04:51.675 --> 04:53.319
<i>No, Joseph,</i>
<i>she doesn't.</i>

04:54.444 --> 04:56.621
SLATER:
<i>She--She moved.</i>

04:58.242 --> 04:59.274
DR. WEST:
<i>She was never there.</i>

05:00.689 --> 05:03.617
<i>What did you do with her?</i>
<i>What did you do?</i>

05:03.652 --> 05:04.849
<i>What did you do</i>
<i>with her?</i>

05:04.884 --> 05:06.831
<i>You give her back.</i>
<i>Give her back!</i>

05:06.866 --> 05:08.547
<i>Bring her back!</i>
<i>Bring her back!</i>

05:08.558 --> 05:09.531
<i>Bring her ba--</i>

05:13.273 --> 05:15.549
OLIVIA: And you can't describe
either of the men?

05:15.666 --> 05:18.531
No. To be honest,
I can barely remember them.

05:19.123 --> 05:20.920
My first clear memory
of last night,

05:20.955 --> 05:22.405
I was turning
from my window,

05:22.706 --> 05:24.111
and Miss Holbrook
was standing there--

05:24.146 --> 05:25.408
one of the nurses,
she was scared.

05:25.475 --> 05:26.938
And they raced me
to the medical ward.

05:27.077 --> 05:30.532
But what struck me was
that I felt unburdened,

05:31.853 --> 05:33.668
like my mind had had
a spring cleaning,

05:33.669 --> 05:35.663
- like I was suddenly--
- Free.

05:38.344 --> 05:39.144
Yes.

05:41.002 --> 05:44.407
And I seem to remember
them being...

05:45.600 --> 05:46.246
pleasant--

05:46.281 --> 05:48.051
polite even--
But beyond that, nothing.

05:48.086 --> 05:49.433
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

05:49.666 --> 05:50.693
Anything else?

05:50.968 --> 05:52.854
No. Not right now.

05:53.103 --> 05:53.899
Thank you.

05:54.367 --> 05:57.618
Okay, in that case, Mr. Slater,
your wife is here.

05:57.794 --> 06:00.113
They tell me that she came
to visit me twice a week.

06:00.148 --> 06:01.880
I think I remember
being horrible to her.

06:03.153 --> 06:06.209
I think it'll be fine.
She's right outside.

06:07.507 --> 06:08.164
Thank you.

06:16.492 --> 06:17.337
WALTER:
<i>He's a lucky man.</i>

06:18.409 --> 06:20.697
17 years that I was
in St. Claire's,

06:20.732 --> 06:21.894
never a single visitor.

06:24.372 --> 06:25.313
Walter...

06:26.926 --> 06:29.922
Oh, I wasn't trying
to make you feel guilty, son.

06:29.957 --> 06:31.321
It was just
an observation.

06:36.313 --> 06:38.581
Walter, have you had
any theories

06:38.616 --> 06:40.217
on how this man
is suddenly sane?

06:40.403 --> 06:43.268
No. Not yet,
but I'm eager to.

06:44.191 --> 06:46.628
A remedy for insanity,
as you can imagine,

06:46.663 --> 06:48.970
I have thought long
and hard about it.

06:56.687 --> 06:57.420
There they are.

06:58.965 --> 07:00.442
Huh.
You see that lock?

07:01.046 --> 07:02.143
Can you zoom in
right there?

07:03.073 --> 07:04.598
That's a lypticro-crypto.

07:05.024 --> 07:05.917
Top of the line.

07:06.246 --> 07:08.360
And these guys took it down
like it's a bicycle lock.

07:08.651 --> 07:10.908
Whoever these guys are,
they're either very smart,

07:10.943 --> 07:13.285
very rich,
or very well-connected.

07:13.505 --> 07:14.660
Can you play
that bit back?

07:19.024 --> 07:20.600
- What?
OLIVIA: Freeze it right there,

07:20.601 --> 07:21.513
<i>when he turns around.</i>

07:24.340 --> 07:25.268
I know that face.

07:26.286 --> 07:27.111
Can I use this?

07:28.865 --> 07:30.671
And some privacy,
if you don't mind.

07:36.399 --> 07:36.901
[keys clacking]

07:36.936 --> 07:38.577
- You know him?
- Mm-hmm.

07:40.572 --> 07:41.477
PETER: <i>Where do you</i>
<i>know him from?</i>

07:41.817 --> 07:44.061
From Laston-Hennings
Cryonics.

07:45.415 --> 07:48.698
Are you referring to the theft
of the frozen heads?

07:48.733 --> 07:51.303
Yeah. William Bell told me
that the people from over there,

07:51.421 --> 07:53.887
the people that tried
to kill me, that killed Charlie,

07:54.212 --> 07:55.691
they were looking
for someone.

07:55.759 --> 07:57.545
Belly said they were looking
for their leader.

07:57.661 --> 08:00.412
Well, I've been combing through
Laston-Hennings' files,

08:00.630 --> 08:02.868
<i>trying to figure out,</i>
<i>of all the heads they took,</i>

08:02.903 --> 08:04.585
which was the one
that they wanted?

08:06.259 --> 08:07.336
I've been looking
at these faces

08:07.337 --> 08:08.601
for the last two months.

08:08.705 --> 08:10.529
Are you really trying
to tell us that <i>he</i>

08:10.564 --> 08:12.175
<i>is one of the heads</i>
<i>that they stole?</i>

08:13.610 --> 08:15.320
Fine. Let's say for a second
that you're right.

08:15.645 --> 08:18.079
Frozen heads don't just get up
and walk into places.

08:18.350 --> 08:20.343
<i>I mean, the dead don't rise</i>
<i>out of their graves</i>

08:20.378 --> 08:21.981
and perform midnight
brain surgery.

08:22.641 --> 08:24.431
No, I know they don't.

08:25.626 --> 08:27.772
But this one did.

08:29.217 --> 08:31.861
<i>"Thomas Jerome Newton."</i>

08:37.417 --> 08:38.510
Wow.

08:42.548 --> 08:43.168
Newton.

08:44.148 --> 08:45.552
So what do we know
about him so far?

08:45.950 --> 08:47.528
Besides his name,
nothing.

08:48.252 --> 08:50.153
Thomas Jerome Newton
was the name on record

08:50.221 --> 08:51.723
at Laston-Hennings Cryonics.

08:51.989 --> 08:53.539
But it was an alias.
It led nowhere.

08:54.392 --> 08:56.793
Now, William Bell told me
the man with that marking

08:56.828 --> 08:59.560
would try to open
a corridor

08:59.597 --> 09:01.736
from our universe
to the other side.

09:02.829 --> 09:03.694
<i>I managed to infer</i>

09:03.729 --> 09:05.513
that the results would be
less than desirable.

09:05.693 --> 09:07.298
Exactly how much
less desirable?

09:08.481 --> 09:09.617
Global destruction...

09:10.541 --> 09:12.007
Biblical proportions.

09:13.544 --> 09:14.476
[sighs]

09:14.812 --> 09:15.563
So what's that have to do

09:15.598 --> 09:16.972
with sneaking
into a mental hospital

09:17.007 --> 09:18.988
to perform brain surgery
on a schizophrenic?

09:19.023 --> 09:21.231
You're leaving out the part
where they apparently cured him.

09:21.540 --> 09:23.933
As opening moves go,
that one's pretty strange.

09:25.448 --> 09:26.665
Where's Dr. Bishop
on this?

09:26.700 --> 09:29.100
He's trying to figure out
exactly how they cured Slater.

09:29.293 --> 09:31.187
If he can do that,
maybe we can anticipate

09:31.222 --> 09:32.080
Newton's next move.

09:32.305 --> 09:33.170
There's no maybe.

09:33.397 --> 09:35.071
I don't know
what Newton's up to,

09:35.106 --> 09:36.175
but I know
what I have to do.

09:36.400 --> 09:37.722
<i>I have to stop him.</i>

09:38.869 --> 09:41.849
Mr. Slater's referring doctor
was a psychiatrist

09:41.906 --> 09:43.545
called Simon Paris.

09:44.701 --> 09:47.800
Let's see if you could locate
Dr. Paris, please, dear.

09:48.446 --> 09:51.716
I have some questions about
Mr. Slater's medical history

09:51.751 --> 09:53.377
before his admission
to Hennington.

09:53.784 --> 09:54.278
Sure.

09:54.781 --> 09:56.204
Why, what are you
looking for?

09:56.239 --> 09:56.810
Not sure.

09:57.955 --> 10:00.367
Something that would induce
the delusional thinking.

10:00.951 --> 10:01.544
Some <i>thing?</i>

10:02.195 --> 10:03.331
Something or <i>someone.</i>

10:04.658 --> 10:06.429
You mean you think
that someone

10:06.497 --> 10:08.364
made him crazy
on purpose?

10:08.854 --> 10:09.730
It's a theory.

10:11.869 --> 10:15.678
The truth is there is no cure
for madness--it's a fantasy.

10:16.991 --> 10:19.550
The road back from madness
is a struggle.

10:20.711 --> 10:23.249
Only the luckiest of people
find their way,

10:23.284 --> 10:25.922
more or less,
back to the world you live in.

10:26.795 --> 10:29.681
And from what we saw
of Mr. Slater...

10:30.621 --> 10:33.194
Well, my only supposition

10:33.229 --> 10:34.557
is that he wasn't mad
to begin with.

10:35.120 --> 10:38.082
There is no Simon Paris
in the A.M.A. database.

10:38.262 --> 10:39.889
<i>He's not</i>
<i>on the membership roster.</i>

10:40.831 --> 10:42.712
- Does that mean that he died?
- It shouldn't.

10:43.167 --> 10:45.107
Even if he had,
there should still be a record.

10:46.378 --> 10:48.608
Um, Mr. Paris' RX number

10:48.643 --> 10:50.897
will be on Mr. Slater's
initial prescription

10:50.932 --> 10:51.574
when he was admitted.

10:51.642 --> 10:52.799
Check the pharmacy
records.

10:54.111 --> 10:55.745
Why would someone
do that, Walter--

10:56.136 --> 10:57.316
<i>Make someone crazy?</i>

10:57.414 --> 10:58.368
WALTER:
<i>Any number of reasons.</i>

10:58.530 --> 10:59.596
<i>It would make them</i>
<i>insusceptible</i>

10:59.631 --> 11:00.839
<i>to interrogation for one.</i>

11:00.840 --> 11:03.530
ASTRID: <i>Huh, according to this,</i>
<i>14 years ago,</i>

11:03.565 --> 11:06.209
Dr. Paris set up
an indefinite prescription

11:06.244 --> 11:08.346
of medications
for Mr. Slater.

11:08.730 --> 11:09.982
<i>No termination date.</i>

11:10.761 --> 11:12.263
<i>Now, this is interesting.</i>

11:12.329 --> 11:14.998
In the same week,
he wrote the same prescription

11:15.065 --> 11:16.728
for two other patients.

11:16.978 --> 11:17.738
In the same week?

11:18.135 --> 11:19.569
At two other hospitals.

11:19.770 --> 11:20.784
- [phone beeping]
- I'll call Olivia.

11:24.608 --> 11:27.258
And when I woke up,
I felt like I had been

11:27.634 --> 11:28.932
out drinking
the night before.

11:29.762 --> 11:31.548
Only the night lasted
14 years.

11:32.027 --> 11:33.049
It says here
that you suffered

11:33.117 --> 11:36.322
from a severe form of
obsessive-compulsive disorder.

11:36.554 --> 11:38.737
Yeah, "arithmomania"
they call it.

11:39.256 --> 11:40.666
You're obsessed
with numbers.

11:41.508 --> 11:42.869
Just one, actually--

11:43.294 --> 11:44.194
28.

11:45.096 --> 11:47.315
I'd see it everywhere,
hear it everywhere.

11:47.965 --> 11:49.422
I could never get it out
of my head.

11:49.697 --> 11:51.052
28, 28.

11:52.336 --> 11:54.132
Then, uh,
last Tuesday morning,

11:54.167 --> 11:56.582
I woke up, and it was gone,
just like that.

11:57.473 --> 11:58.721
Suddenly, I was free.

11:59.210 --> 12:00.715
And your doctors
have no explanation?

12:01.459 --> 12:02.442
Between you and me,

12:02.832 --> 12:04.394
I think that's why
they're keeping me here.

12:05.217 --> 12:07.109
One of them is probably hoping
to get a paper out of it.

12:09.429 --> 12:12.103
So what does this have to do
with the FBI?

12:12.326 --> 12:13.131
OLIVIA:
<i>We're not sure.</i>

12:13.734 --> 12:14.531
Maybe nothing.

12:15.693 --> 12:17.451
But do you mind if we take
a look at your head?

12:17.561 --> 12:18.273
My head?

12:18.596 --> 12:19.871
<i>It should only take</i>
<i>a minute.</i>

12:20.555 --> 12:22.146
Is there somewhere
that you could sit down?

12:29.708 --> 12:30.396
Excuse me.

12:35.012 --> 12:36.365
What are you looking for?

12:38.762 --> 12:39.601
It's here.

12:41.209 --> 12:43.148
PETER: <i>A fresh scar,</i>
<i>but there are no sutures.</i>

12:44.032 --> 12:46.578
Looks more like the burn
from a surgical laser.

12:47.511 --> 12:48.705
I don't understand.

12:49.285 --> 12:50.801
What kind of scar?

12:51.263 --> 12:52.629
<i>What are you saying</i>
<i>happened to me?</i>

12:53.120 --> 12:54.944
Mrs. Crampton,
did you have any visitors

12:54.979 --> 12:55.944
during your stay here?

12:55.945 --> 12:57.418
My husband, my son.

12:57.693 --> 13:00.346
But what about the doctor
who referred you--Dr. Paris?

13:00.510 --> 13:02.015
No. Never.

13:02.167 --> 13:04.837
I only saw him a couple times
before he sent me here.

13:05.086 --> 13:06.409
But it was Dr. Paris
who diagnosed

13:06.477 --> 13:07.678
the arithmomania, right?

13:08.271 --> 13:12.299
Oh, no. He saw me
for mild depression, postpartum.

13:13.017 --> 13:16.223
Told me I needed to rest
a few weeks and sent me here.

13:17.877 --> 13:20.730
The arithmomania
just started one day.

13:27.531 --> 13:29.431
- How we doing?
- It should work,

13:29.533 --> 13:31.094
but we took too long
getting to Slater.

13:31.101 --> 13:32.667
The first specimen's dying.

13:33.104 --> 13:34.609
The nutrient bath
won't keep it alive

13:34.638 --> 13:36.101
for more than another
five hours.

13:36.206 --> 13:37.306
Six if we're lucky.

13:37.441 --> 13:38.660
Then we better
get moving.

13:49.019 --> 13:51.095
Third patient,
Stuart Gordon.

13:53.090 --> 13:54.448
Just like Mrs. Crampton.

13:55.092 --> 13:58.152
14 years ago,
Dr. Paris refers him

13:58.187 --> 13:59.056
to a mental hospital

13:59.091 --> 14:00.999
with the psychiatric equivalent
of a cough,

14:01.034 --> 14:03.132
which then develops
into full-blown schizophrenia.

14:03.367 --> 14:06.748
Two days ago,
he miraculously recovers.

14:07.348 --> 14:08.301
<i>Apparently,</i>
<i>Mr. Gordon thought</i>

14:08.336 --> 14:09.711
he was the actor
Sydney Greenstreet

14:10.174 --> 14:12.049
and walked around
quoting <i>Casablanca.</i>

14:15.192 --> 14:15.799
That's funny.

14:16.962 --> 14:17.515
What?

14:18.473 --> 14:20.033
He looks a lot more
like Peter Lorre.

14:22.965 --> 14:23.721
That's a joke.

14:27.691 --> 14:29.559
You know, all my life
I've been able to understand

14:29.626 --> 14:30.679
what drives people--

14:31.261 --> 14:33.930
Their emotions, like greed
or envy or revenge.

14:33.998 --> 14:35.398
But Newton--

14:36.049 --> 14:37.634
<i>These people</i>
<i>we're up against...</i>

14:38.466 --> 14:40.674
How can I fight
what I can't understand?

14:41.105 --> 14:43.782
Olivia, I know you think
you're alone in this.

14:44.708 --> 14:46.584
Maybe that's because
of what Bell told you.

14:47.183 --> 14:48.928
Maybe that's just
your personality.

14:49.079 --> 14:50.977
But this isn't just
your fight.

14:59.819 --> 15:00.874
That was Olivia.

15:01.190 --> 15:03.259
Stuart Gordon
is just like the others.

15:03.308 --> 15:05.377
Two days ago,
he woke up perfectly sane.

15:05.562 --> 15:07.388
He's got a fresh scar
on the back of his head.

15:08.230 --> 15:09.540
I must have missed
something.

15:10.167 --> 15:13.212
When did Mr. Slater
have an organ transplant?

15:13.579 --> 15:14.323
I'm sorry?

15:14.738 --> 15:17.073
Oh, one of the drugs
that Dr. Paris prescribed

15:17.141 --> 15:19.008
is sirolimus--
It's an anti-rejection drug.

15:19.076 --> 15:21.310
It's only given to
organ-transplant patients.

15:21.378 --> 15:24.333
It's absolutely useless
for a paranoid schizophrenic.

15:25.389 --> 15:29.269
It suggests that not only
has Dr. Paris vanished,

15:29.304 --> 15:30.015
he's a quack!

15:35.113 --> 15:36.359
Unless he's a genius.

15:36.855 --> 15:37.512
What?

15:39.596 --> 15:41.440
Organ transplants.

15:42.481 --> 15:43.826
The human brain.

15:44.935 --> 15:47.013
Well, half of one.

15:47.504 --> 15:49.354
But it's useless dead,

15:49.700 --> 15:52.809
because when you remove
brain tissue from a living body,

15:52.810 --> 15:54.210
you can keep it alive
for a short time

15:54.278 --> 15:55.456
in a nutrient suspension.

15:55.612 --> 15:56.944
But eventually,
it will die.

15:57.181 --> 15:59.396
It's a problem
I've tried to solve many times

15:59.431 --> 16:01.150
- <i>without success.</i>
- Keeping a human brain alive?

16:01.218 --> 16:03.609
It's very tricky.
You see,

16:03.821 --> 16:06.682
<i>it's not enough to simply</i>
<i>give it blood and oxygen.</i>

16:06.717 --> 16:09.290
You have to give it
electrical stimulation as well.

16:09.426 --> 16:12.428
But Dr. Paris
found a solution.

16:12.496 --> 16:17.284
He stored the brain tissue
inside of another brain.

16:17.790 --> 16:19.706
I'm sorry, I don't follow.
What brain tissue?

16:20.226 --> 16:21.491
Our mental patients'.

16:21.505 --> 16:24.368
Mr. Slater, Mrs. Crampton,
and Mr. Condon.

16:24.403 --> 16:25.021
Gordon.

16:25.022 --> 16:27.287
These are
a few years old.

16:27.778 --> 16:29.835
But you see the slight
discoloration here?

16:29.870 --> 16:30.680
PETER:
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

16:30.747 --> 16:32.849
WALTER: <i>Normally that would be</i>
<i>interpreted as machine error.</i>

16:32.916 --> 16:34.349
<i>But this is not</i>
<i>a machine error.</i>

16:36.036 --> 16:37.160
This is foreign tissue.

16:37.788 --> 16:40.174
That's why they were all
on anti-rejection drugs.

16:40.209 --> 16:42.458
So the surgeries
that Newton performed...

16:42.459 --> 16:44.439
He was removing
transplanted brain tissue.

16:44.594 --> 16:48.272
And my hypothesis explains
the patients' madness.

16:48.307 --> 16:50.204
<i>Putting the tissue</i>
<i>of one person</i>

16:50.239 --> 16:51.533
into the brain
of another is--

16:52.236 --> 16:55.204
It--It's like putting
a motorcycle engine into a car.

16:55.272 --> 16:56.608
It's simply incompatible.

16:56.609 --> 16:58.664
Of course, because the host mind
would have no way

16:58.699 --> 17:00.101
to process
the new information.

17:00.357 --> 17:01.446
Thus, the mental distress.

17:01.447 --> 17:03.447
The false memories,
delusions.

17:03.482 --> 17:05.181
But as soon as you remove
the foreign tissue,

17:05.810 --> 17:06.705
then they're fine.

17:06.885 --> 17:07.997
Correct.

17:08.596 --> 17:09.934
[cell phone rings]

17:10.186 --> 17:11.465
Agent Farnsworth.

17:11.488 --> 17:12.982
<i>Hi, this is Doctor West.</i>

17:13.017 --> 17:14.724
You asked me to see
if we had any information

17:14.777 --> 17:17.292
on Dr. Paris at our facility--
We didn't.

17:17.361 --> 17:18.828
Oh, all right.

17:18.896 --> 17:20.229
- Well, thank you for--
- <i>I'm not finished.</i>

17:20.297 --> 17:22.765
We also checked with some
of our affiliated facilities.

17:23.050 --> 17:23.670
Oh?

17:24.253 --> 17:26.234
Well, that just
leaves more questions.

17:26.303 --> 17:29.256
Why cut out someone's brain and
store it inside other people?

17:29.412 --> 17:30.486
And whose brain is it?

17:31.255 --> 17:32.308
WALTER: <i>That's a good question,</i>
<i>of course.</i>

17:32.376 --> 17:32.766
[beep]

17:32.884 --> 17:34.288
- And I have no idea.
- Peter...

17:34.527 --> 17:36.384
Can I, uh,
speak to you a moment?

17:48.901 --> 17:50.860
Walter, you said that
you never had any visitors

17:50.928 --> 17:52.353
in your time
at St. Claire's, right?

17:53.368 --> 17:54.181
That's right.

17:54.765 --> 17:57.401
According to their records,
Dr. Paris visited you

17:57.436 --> 17:58.884
on six separate
occasions.

18:05.339 --> 18:07.213
You mind if I take a look
at your head?

18:10.111 --> 18:10.782
Okay.

18:14.284 --> 18:16.567
[breathes deeply]

18:23.716 --> 18:24.479
PETER:
<i>It's there.</i>

18:26.853 --> 18:28.558
I-It's different.
It's older. But...

18:30.002 --> 18:30.860
[sighs]

18:30.895 --> 18:32.010
There's definitely
a scar.

18:40.783 --> 18:42.175
I can see
from your chart

18:42.210 --> 18:44.042
that you've been through
this procedure before,

18:44.212 --> 18:45.298
several times,
in fact.

18:48.249 --> 18:50.244
This is not
a good idea, Peter.

18:50.385 --> 18:52.854
These M.R.I. machines
have magnets

18:52.889 --> 18:55.302
that rip the metal
out of the patients.

18:55.303 --> 18:58.292
And I have that tracking chip
implanted in my neck--

18:58.607 --> 19:00.766
The GPS locator.
I--

19:00.962 --> 19:02.772
You have absolutely nothing
to worry about,

19:03.726 --> 19:05.096
because it's made
out of silicon.

19:05.923 --> 19:07.167
And you know
as well as I do

19:07.235 --> 19:08.869
that it won't be affected
by the machine.

19:09.489 --> 19:10.537
Maybe some Valium
would help.

19:11.213 --> 19:14.441
You know, I don't do Valium
nearly enough.

19:14.509 --> 19:15.562
<i>That's a good idea.</i>

19:15.743 --> 19:17.811
I--I'll have 50 milligrams,
please.

19:18.143 --> 19:20.198
Well, that's--that's quite
a high dosage.

19:20.482 --> 19:22.659
I have quite
a high tolerance.

19:23.592 --> 19:24.633
All right.

19:27.650 --> 19:28.785
<i>You're going to be fine.</i>

19:28.845 --> 19:29.338
Yeah.

19:30.025 --> 19:31.422
It's a routine procedure.

19:32.460 --> 19:34.394
And the Valium will take care
of any claustrophobia

19:34.395 --> 19:35.178
you might be feeling.

19:35.200 --> 19:37.591
I'm not worried
about claustrophobia, Peter.

19:40.551 --> 19:42.286
What do you think
that man did to me?

19:44.855 --> 19:46.363
I don't know, Walter.

19:49.778 --> 19:51.365
But we're going
to find out, okay?

20:22.214 --> 20:23.893
- You okay?
- Yeah.

20:24.457 --> 20:26.102
Yeah, Walter wanted
to stick around

20:26.137 --> 20:26.721
and wait for the results,

20:26.790 --> 20:28.717
but there's Walter
on drugs,

20:28.752 --> 20:29.965
and then there's Walter
on drugs.

20:31.052 --> 20:32.246
I had Astrid
take him home.

20:37.706 --> 20:38.521
You see the look
on his face

20:38.580 --> 20:39.868
when we were talking
to Mr. Slater?

20:41.620 --> 20:43.111
What do you think
that's like for him...

20:45.018 --> 20:46.394
Wishing that he could
turn back the clock

20:46.429 --> 20:47.546
to before
he went crazy?

20:52.941 --> 20:55.432
He's just sane enough
to realize how much he's lost.

20:58.233 --> 20:59.657
I don't mean
to sound callous,

20:59.692 --> 21:02.744
but from what I know
of your father...

21:03.937 --> 21:05.849
Going crazy made him
a better person.

21:06.701 --> 21:08.296
It certainly made him
a better father.

21:14.329 --> 21:16.455
I should have visited him
in St. Claire's.

21:18.974 --> 21:20.669
I think you're making up
for that now.

21:27.575 --> 21:28.546
[clears throat]

21:28.877 --> 21:30.813
I've reviewed the scans
of your father's brain.

21:31.446 --> 21:33.476
- And?
- You should take a look.

21:34.349 --> 21:35.682
DR. WEST: I've never seen
anything like it.

21:35.750 --> 21:37.786
Three scars,
all on the same side

21:37.821 --> 21:38.933
in the left temporal lobe.

21:39.621 --> 21:41.311
These incisions
go all the way down

21:41.346 --> 21:42.122
into the gray matter.

21:42.423 --> 21:43.394
I'm not following.

21:43.558 --> 21:45.340
Walter didn't have
brain tissue implanted.

21:45.360 --> 21:46.213
He had it removed.

21:46.361 --> 21:47.761
DR. WEST:
<i>Yes, from the hippocampus.</i>

21:47.829 --> 21:48.980
And as far
as I can tell,

21:48.981 --> 21:50.364
there would be
no medical reason for it.

21:50.775 --> 21:53.033
So what does it do...
the hippocampus?

21:53.101 --> 21:54.855
<i>It controls</i>
<i>our inhibitions,</i>

21:54.890 --> 21:56.211
helps store
long-term memory,

21:56.251 --> 21:58.173
<i>contributes to our sense</i>
<i>of spatial awareness.</i>

21:58.208 --> 22:00.105
Doctor, do you have the scans
of the other three patients?

22:00.140 --> 22:00.616
Sure.

22:02.245 --> 22:02.926
What are you thinking?

22:03.311 --> 22:04.188
Hold on one second.

22:08.885 --> 22:10.449

22:18.425 --> 22:19.203

22:21.672 --> 22:22.786
It's a perfect fit.

22:24.873 --> 22:26.960
WALTER:
<i>I took too much Valium.</i>

22:27.402 --> 22:30.767
Confusion,
dizziness, nausea.

22:32.240 --> 22:34.973
I think I must have
miscalculated the dose.

22:35.515 --> 22:37.699
Maybe we should take you
to a hospital, Walter.

22:38.746 --> 22:40.584
I don't want to go
to a hospital.

22:47.722 --> 22:50.560
I need
Violet Sedan Chair.

22:51.282 --> 22:52.870
Walter, you're not
making any sense.

22:53.328 --> 22:57.320
My dear, Violet Sedan Chair,
it's a band.

22:58.055 --> 22:59.459
Their debut album...

23:00.768 --> 23:03.426

from a Valium high.

23:06.074 --> 23:07.541
It's in the lab.
We should go--

23:07.608 --> 23:08.815
[straining]

23:08.906 --> 23:09.491
Walter...

23:11.196 --> 23:13.433
No, you--
You do the driving.

23:15.476 --> 23:17.519
I might puke in your car.

23:18.186 --> 23:20.621
Why don't
you stay here and rest

23:20.788 --> 23:21.686
and let me get it?

23:22.590 --> 23:24.007
[breathing deeply]

23:28.429 --> 23:29.784
- Okay.
- That might be the best.

23:30.171 --> 23:31.204
I'll be back.

23:33.783 --> 23:35.569
OLIVIA:
<i>It must be Paris.</i>

23:35.922 --> 23:38.138
He must have removed
pieces of Walter's brain.

23:38.206 --> 23:39.116
But why?

23:39.207 --> 23:40.942
And--and why preserve them?

23:43.244 --> 23:43.939
Memory.

23:45.413 --> 23:46.871
The hippocampus--
Memory storage.

23:47.148 --> 23:48.849
Bell told you that Newton
wants to open a door

23:48.884 --> 23:49.799
to the other side, right?

23:50.051 --> 23:51.255
Well, we already know
that Walter's done that.

23:51.306 --> 23:52.436
He just can't remember how.

23:53.388 --> 23:55.125
That is why
he can't remember.

23:56.457 --> 23:58.363
He literally had
the memories removed.

23:59.262 --> 24:00.211
No way.

24:00.582 --> 24:02.696
OLIVIA: <i>So then how does Newton</i>
<i>read them?</i>

24:03.035 --> 24:04.185
PETER: <i>In theory,</i>
<i>he shouldn't be able to.</i>

24:04.220 --> 24:05.182
But in theory,
he should still be

24:05.252 --> 24:06.028
a frozen head.

24:06.467 --> 24:07.703
So in the department
of how to make

24:07.742 --> 24:09.326
impossible things possible,
what would he need to do?

24:09.671 --> 24:10.607
He would need to...

24:12.462 --> 24:13.551
implant the memories

24:13.586 --> 24:14.923
into a brain
that could interpret them.

24:16.208 --> 24:16.757
Walter.

24:21.582 --> 24:22.365

24:24.352 --> 24:25.282
ASTRID:
<i>I'm going to the lab.</i>

24:25.453 --> 24:26.538
He's at your house.

24:26.621 --> 24:28.055
He sent me to get him
an album.

24:28.431 --> 24:30.423
- How long ago?
- <i>Five minutes ago.</i>

24:30.458 --> 24:32.715
You've got to get back there.
Walter is in danger.

24:33.176 --> 24:33.812

24:56.151 --> 24:57.224
Hello, Dr. Bishop.

25:06.506 --> 25:09.171
Peter. He was already gone
when I got here.

25:10.043 --> 25:11.019
I'm sorry.

25:11.036 --> 25:13.015
Peter, I-I shouldn't
have left him.

25:14.247 --> 25:16.145
It's not your fault.
You didn't know.

25:17.084 --> 25:18.045
<i>I got an idea.</i>

25:18.552 --> 25:19.885
Last week
when Walter got lost,

25:19.920 --> 25:21.760
he did exactly what
you'd expect Walter to do.

25:21.866 --> 25:23.917
He implanted a transponder chip
into his neck

25:23.952 --> 25:26.547
so that if he ever got lost,
I could find him.

25:27.594 --> 25:29.266
He can't be far.
Let's go.

25:32.599 --> 25:35.177
Hold still, please.
This wont hurt a bit.

25:40.107 --> 25:42.323
WALTER: I'm sorry,
do we know each other?

25:42.324 --> 25:43.118
Oh, we will.

25:44.311 --> 25:47.773
This is a mild sedative,
something to calm your nerves.

25:47.848 --> 25:51.407
I've already had
50 milligrams of Valium.

25:51.718 --> 25:53.788
Then this should be
very enjoyable.

Now, figuring out where

There are no right

But please tell me
the truth.

27:39.750 --> 27:41.983
If you don't, I'll know.

27:43.027 --> 27:45.431
You're using associations

this is difficult.

28:51.474 --> 28:52.608
It's not working.

28:52.975 --> 28:54.485
He's not making
the connections.

28:55.177 --> 28:56.415
Should I recalibrate
the machine?

28:56.450 --> 28:57.212
<i>No, no, no, no, no.</i>

28:57.478 --> 28:59.047
We need to find something
more powerful

28:59.115 --> 29:00.268
to stimulate his memory.

29:03.847 --> 29:04.433
<i>Of course.</i>

29:04.468 --> 29:06.021
Human memory
is sensory based.

29:06.055 --> 29:07.898
Vision alone is not
the strongest trigger.

29:07.948 --> 29:10.809
<i>Sound and smell</i>
<i>actually work better.</i>

29:13.095 --> 29:13.803
We need...

29:15.831 --> 29:17.512
a proper context.

29:20.803 --> 29:23.684
Okay, Walter said brain tissue
can't survive for long

29:23.739 --> 29:24.773
outside a human body.

29:24.840 --> 29:26.110
Which means
they've got to be close.

29:26.409 --> 29:27.959
We've raised the alert level
at every hospital,

29:27.994 --> 29:29.877
emergency care facility,
and outpatient clinic

29:29.878 --> 29:30.970
in the Greater Boston area.

29:31.046 --> 29:32.226
We're even calling
veterinarians.

29:32.277 --> 29:33.700
That's assuming
that they need a hospital

29:33.701 --> 29:34.451
to complete the procedure.

29:34.486 --> 29:36.678
With their level of technology,
we can't know for sure.

29:36.686 --> 29:38.050
It's a start,
and if we're wrong,

29:38.085 --> 29:38.912
we'll have to get
creative.

29:40.823 --> 29:41.971
The girl
in the red dress.

29:43.192 --> 29:44.015
How did I miss this?

29:44.293 --> 29:45.393
The girl in the red dress,

29:45.461 --> 29:47.265
28, 28,
Sydney Greenstreet.

29:47.597 --> 29:49.826
Dr. Paris' patients,
they all had obsessions.

29:50.366 --> 29:51.574
Slater
was always ranting

29:51.609 --> 29:53.802
about the girl who lived
across the street,

29:53.803 --> 29:55.111
the one that we thought
never existed.

29:55.304 --> 29:55.999
She did exist.

29:56.405 --> 29:57.706
She lived
across the street from me

29:57.773 --> 29:59.170
when I lived in Cambridge
as a kid.

29:59.308 --> 30:00.081
Her name was Sydney.

30:00.132 --> 30:02.160
She lived at 2828 Green Street.

30:02.195 --> 30:03.298
So those were
Walter's memories.

30:03.333 --> 30:03.788
<i>Exactly.</i>

30:03.823 --> 30:04.698
Memory is all about--

30:05.114 --> 30:06.915
It's all about context,
all about association.

30:06.983 --> 30:09.465
Every time Walter asks
for a piece of food

30:09.500 --> 30:11.386
or music or art, he's trying
to recreate a moment in time

30:11.454 --> 30:12.359
to help him remember.

30:12.455 --> 30:13.398
Which suggests what?

30:13.522 --> 30:15.608
I don't know.
I don't know.

30:16.025 --> 30:17.374
But if they're trying
to get him to remember

30:17.409 --> 30:19.260
how it was that he built
a door to the other side,

30:19.328 --> 30:21.309
maybe they're--
Maybe they're gonna take him

30:21.344 --> 30:22.123
to the place
that he did it.

30:22.802 --> 30:24.133
- Reiden Lake--the lake house.
- <i>No, no, no, no, no.</i>

30:24.168 --> 30:25.697
No, no, that's where
he actually opened the door,

30:25.732 --> 30:26.867
but it's not where
he had the thought.

30:29.405 --> 30:31.503
WALTER:
<i>This place looks familiar.</i>

30:33.571 --> 30:35.958
Last time I was here,
it was a different season.

30:36.746 --> 30:38.522
The leaves were falling.

30:38.714 --> 30:41.181
Yes, this place exists
in both worlds.

30:41.895 --> 30:44.887
You see, but on my side,
the trees died long ago.

30:45.054 --> 30:46.930
And the same thing
killed the grass.

30:47.156 --> 30:48.343
They call it the Blight.

30:49.685 --> 30:50.859
That's terrible.

30:51.176 --> 30:52.059

30:57.194 --> 30:57.694

31:03.738 --> 31:04.785
<i>Now, Dr. Bishop,</i>

31:05.573 --> 31:08.457
I can see which areas
of your brain can make sense

31:08.492 --> 31:10.897
of the data that's stored
in these slivers of flesh.

31:11.540 --> 31:12.527
<i>In a perfect world,</i>

31:12.577 --> 31:14.110
I would simply
put it back,

to a process so crude.

31:31.967 --> 31:33.355
You do know where you are,
don't you?

31:43.609 --> 31:44.840
Of course I do.

31:45.735 --> 31:47.242

31:56.859 --> 31:58.258
Yes. And now...

31:58.627 --> 31:59.825
I have a question
for you.

32:01.397 --> 32:03.717
You once built a door--

32:04.767 --> 32:06.739
A door that let you walk
between worlds.

32:10.974 --> 32:12.128
Tell me how you did it.

32:14.629 --> 32:16.857
How are things
on your side?

32:17.183 --> 32:18.646
Worse, I'm told.

32:20.483 --> 32:23.544
I know why you built it,
the door.

32:25.355 --> 32:26.817
I know what you lost.

32:28.111 --> 32:29.218
Now, are you going
to pretend

32:29.248 --> 32:30.772
that you're willing
to lose him again?

32:34.735 --> 32:39.224
Now, tell me
about the door.

32:59.359 --> 33:00.061
We got company.

33:00.500 --> 33:00.987
They're here.

33:01.825 --> 33:03.365
That's okay.
We're done.

33:03.861 --> 33:05.078

34:23.306 --> 34:24.710
Freeze! FBI!

34:29.446 --> 34:30.913
[tires squeal]

34:52.826 --> 34:53.898
Come out of there.

35:08.319 --> 35:09.847
Step down slowly.

35:10.821 --> 35:12.509
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

35:14.225 --> 35:15.915
You so much as twitch,

35:15.950 --> 35:18.409
and you won't have
a head left to refreeze.

35:27.204 --> 35:27.954
Are they mine?

35:29.707 --> 35:30.187
Yep.

35:33.043 --> 35:34.594
My brain tissue,
Peter...

35:35.679 --> 35:36.316
It's dying.

35:37.314 --> 35:39.042
Whatever was in there...

35:41.652 --> 35:43.408
Memories
I'll never get back.

35:44.422 --> 35:45.878
It's all right.
You don't need them.

35:48.019 --> 35:49.119
[chuckles]

35:50.728 --> 35:51.690
Hello, son.

35:59.169 --> 36:00.317
Hello, son.

36:02.039 --> 36:03.035
[gags]

36:03.213 --> 36:03.892
Walter?

36:05.309 --> 36:06.560
Oh! Walter!

36:07.411 --> 36:09.237
Hey, Walter, look at me.
Walter!

36:09.580 --> 36:11.114
NEWTON: I think there's something
you should know.

36:11.902 --> 36:12.978
It's about Walter Bishop.

36:13.751 --> 36:16.409
He's going to die unless
you do exactly what I say.

36:17.154 --> 36:18.856
I injected him
with a neurotoxin,

36:18.891 --> 36:21.804
and unless he gets
the antidote in four minutes,

36:21.964 --> 36:22.692
it will kill him.

36:23.494 --> 36:26.198
Call it my fail-safe
to ensure my escape.

36:26.360 --> 36:27.199
You're bluffing.

36:30.134 --> 36:33.403
[phone beeps, line trilling]

36:33.470 --> 36:34.193
Hey, it's me.

36:34.212 --> 36:35.107
They've done something
to Walter.

36:35.142 --> 36:36.277
I-I don't know
what it is,

36:36.278 --> 36:38.272
but I think maybe
he's been poisoned.

36:38.509 --> 36:39.403
His pulse is racing.

36:39.510 --> 36:40.388
What did you do to him?

36:40.487 --> 36:42.910
Ask him if he sees
a medical kit I left behind.

36:42.913 --> 36:44.075
Olivia, you've got to get
back here.

36:44.682 --> 36:46.785
Please! Please.
I need your help.

36:46.786 --> 36:49.044
Okay, Peter, listen to me.
Do you see a medical kit?

36:49.219 --> 36:50.825
Yeah, there's one here
on the table. Why?

36:50.921 --> 36:52.558
There are three vials
in the kit.

36:52.723 --> 36:55.247
Injected in the correct order,
they neutralize the toxin.

36:55.659 --> 36:57.226
- Tell me.
- No, no, no, no, no.

36:57.294 --> 36:57.979
Not yet.

36:59.029 --> 37:02.915
You have about two minutes
until Dr. Bishop dies.

37:02.916 --> 37:05.420
At a flat run, I estimate
about 40 seconds

37:05.470 --> 37:06.463
until you get
back to him.

37:07.238 --> 37:08.358
Now, hand me
your phone.

37:08.539 --> 37:10.159
When I hear you go
back into the house,

37:10.194 --> 37:12.810
from Peter's phone,
I'll tell you what to do.

37:13.010 --> 37:14.833
You're crazy if you think
I'm letting you go.

37:14.859 --> 37:16.412
PETER: <i>Olivia, please,</i>
<i>I need your help.</i>

37:16.714 --> 37:17.628
I think he's dying.

37:18.849 --> 37:21.022
Oh, God, Walter.
Walter!

37:21.785 --> 37:23.081
<i>The choice is yours.</i>

37:23.487 --> 37:24.706
You can have me...

37:26.223 --> 37:27.129
or Walter Bishop.

37:32.345 --> 37:35.339
One minute,
45 seconds.

37:35.374 --> 37:36.811
Come on, Olivia.

37:36.812 --> 37:37.996
PETER: <i>Olivia, please,</i>
<i>you got to get back here.</i>

37:38.047 --> 37:39.291
- <i>I need your help.</i>
- Make your choice--

37:40.292 --> 37:42.841
Me or Walter Bishop.

37:49.134 --> 37:50.338
Go to hell.

38:06.485 --> 38:07.228
Give me your phone!

38:09.165 --> 38:10.957
Okay, you son of a bitch.

38:12.358 --> 38:13.987
NEWTON: <i>Do you have</i>
<i>the medical kit?</i>

38:14.225 --> 38:14.786
Got it.

38:14.933 --> 38:16.097
Okay, tell me
how to do this.

38:16.679 --> 38:18.591
Blue, yellow, red.

38:19.152 --> 38:22.328
Okay, blue, yellow, red.

38:28.028 --> 38:31.148
And, Olivia, now I know
how weak you are.

38:31.814 --> 38:32.897
- [phone beeps]
- [injection hissing]

38:56.230 --> 38:57.666
[gasps]

39:03.879 --> 39:04.552
Peter...

39:07.579 --> 39:09.609
I have
a terrible headache...

39:11.426 --> 39:14.990
and a sudden craving
for chicken wings.

39:19.758 --> 39:21.331
[Peter sighs deeply]

39:28.667 --> 39:31.068
OLIVIA: <i>He was right.</i>
<i>I made an emotional choice.</i>

39:31.103 --> 39:33.677
I chose my friend
over my responsibility.

39:33.939 --> 39:36.607
And we have no idea
if Walter gave Newton

39:36.675 --> 39:37.991
the plans for the door.

39:38.177 --> 39:39.283
Walter doesn't remember,

39:39.478 --> 39:41.989
and the brain tissue
that Newton extracted is dead.

39:42.081 --> 39:44.548
- And Dr. Paris?
- Nothing. He's vanished.

39:44.930 --> 39:46.520
So all we have
is more questions.

39:46.555 --> 39:47.825
I mean, who is Paris?

39:48.020 --> 39:49.988
How did Newton know
about Walter's memories?

39:50.055 --> 39:51.299
And why did they let
Walter live?

39:51.790 --> 39:53.553
I suspect that's the way
this is going to be.

39:54.126 --> 39:56.242
The more answers we get,
the more questions they'll lead to.

39:56.562 --> 39:57.984
We didn't get
any answers.

39:58.547 --> 39:59.230
Sure we did.

39:59.997 --> 40:02.534
We've given our enemy
a name and a face.

40:02.768 --> 40:03.660
That's something.

40:05.035 --> 40:06.537
And you saved
Dr. Bishop's life.

40:06.605 --> 40:07.459
That's something too,

40:08.224 --> 40:09.385
because despite
what you think,

40:09.808 --> 40:12.117
you made a rational choice,
not an emotional one.

40:12.378 --> 40:14.479
If you had captured Newton
or even killed him,

40:14.546 --> 40:15.761
that wouldn't have been
the end of this.

40:16.874 --> 40:18.521
But there's only one
Walter Bishop...

40:21.242 --> 40:23.083
and we'll be needing him
before this is over.

40:26.158 --> 40:27.713
Don't be so hard
on yourself.

40:28.727 --> 40:30.233
We're gonna be
needing you too.

40:38.297 --> 40:41.168
[overlapping chatter]

40:45.611 --> 40:47.190
They just want to make sure
that everything's okay.

40:47.846 --> 40:48.628
I know.

40:54.920 --> 40:56.286
I should have
visited you, Walter,

40:57.921 --> 40:59.076
while you were
in St. Claire's.

41:01.360 --> 41:02.890
Oh, that's okay,
Peter.

41:06.732 --> 41:09.005
If you had, I probably
wouldn't have remembered anyway.

41:15.844 --> 41:17.416
I'll be right outside
if you need me.

41:26.218 --> 41:29.387
[pulsating sound waves]

41:47.059 --> 41:48.298
He's ready, Dr. Paris.

41:48.841 --> 41:50.823
<i>His system</i>
<i>is completely clean?</i>

41:50.976 --> 41:54.666
<i>No sedatives,</i>
<i>no antidepressants?</i>

41:55.314 --> 41:57.575
- The electrodes are in place.
- <i>Good.</i>

42:05.390 --> 42:06.588
Hello, Walter.

42:08.875 --> 42:09.897
Are you comfortable?

42:10.814 --> 42:11.977
Comfortable?

42:14.500 --> 42:16.134
I'm frightened, Belly.

42:18.355 --> 42:19.830
I wish there was
another way.

42:20.806 --> 42:22.699
But what
you've accomplished...

42:23.809 --> 42:25.436
It's just too dangerous.

42:27.255 --> 42:29.783
But what if we ever
have to go back?

42:30.482 --> 42:33.085
Don't worry.
Your memory--

42:33.504 --> 42:35.998
I'll put it in a place
that only I can find.

42:38.277 --> 42:39.712
Now, listen to me,
Walter.

42:41.537 --> 42:44.726
You designed a door
to the other side.

42:45.898 --> 42:47.881
I want you to think
about that door.
