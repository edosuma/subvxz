WEBVTT

00:12.762 --> 00:14.889
Excuse me, we're--
we're closing early.

00:14.973 --> 00:17.225
Ut, Ãºt! Ut, Ãºt.

00:17.308 --> 00:18.893
Megan.

00:18.977 --> 00:20.145
All right--

00:20.228 --> 00:22.272
I sincerely hope nobody
followed you here.

00:22.355 --> 00:23.773
Nobody followed me here.
I'm better than that.

00:23.857 --> 00:25.358
Come on. Hey, why are you
freaking out on me?

00:25.442 --> 00:27.068
- I'm not!

00:27.152 --> 00:28.695
I'm not. I'm sorry.

00:30.029 --> 00:32.615
It's good to see you,
but you being here is not good.

00:32.699 --> 00:34.534
What do you mean?
You told me you needed help.

00:34.617 --> 00:35.910
When did I ever say that?

00:36.703 --> 00:39.247
These messages.
Hello, "bravo" means danger,

00:39.330 --> 00:41.082
"7700" means emergency,

00:41.166 --> 00:42.625
and bring the--
the puffin keychain

00:42.709 --> 00:43.626
to the queen of Long Island.

00:43.710 --> 00:44.794
Okay, that's very sweet,

00:44.878 --> 00:46.296
but I'm not
the queen of Long Island.

00:46.379 --> 00:48.840
Cassie, I was asking you
to bring the key

00:48.923 --> 00:50.049
to our friend Cherri,

00:50.133 --> 00:52.802
who works at the Queen
Strip Club on Long Island.

00:52.886 --> 00:55.638
You just overshot
a few thousand miles.

00:55.722 --> 00:57.307
Okay, your explanation
is a lot better.

01:00.769 --> 01:03.688
Now listen,
that key is for a lockbox

01:03.772 --> 01:05.774
where I stashed evidence
against the North Koreans.

01:05.857 --> 01:07.650
Jesus Christ,
the North Koreans?

01:07.734 --> 01:09.611
Why didn't you just
bring the box here with you?

01:09.694 --> 01:11.237
I was trying
to keep it safe, okay?

01:11.321 --> 01:12.405
'Cause I want to use it

01:12.489 --> 01:13.448
to try to make some kind
of deal

01:13.531 --> 01:15.408
because honestly,

01:15.492 --> 01:17.327
I don't know how much longer
I can stay safe

01:17.410 --> 01:18.453
living on the lam like this.

01:22.332 --> 01:25.251
- Where'd everyone go?
- Hi.

01:25.335 --> 01:28.713
Very lucky to have Charlie
here. She basically saved me.

01:28.797 --> 01:30.340
Charlie, this is Cassie.

01:30.423 --> 01:31.508
Cassie Cassie?

01:31.591 --> 01:32.926
Cassie Cassie, yeah.

01:33.009 --> 01:35.178
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, what am I doing here?

01:35.261 --> 01:36.346
Well, she sent me a message

01:36.429 --> 01:38.556
that I completely
misinterpreted, and here I am.

01:38.640 --> 01:41.851
Full disclosure, Charlie runs
bluefin tuna fishing boats

01:41.935 --> 01:42.852
out of Nova Scotia

01:42.936 --> 01:44.437
and sells them
on the black market.

01:44.521 --> 01:46.940
It started in Asia,
but the black market margins

01:47.023 --> 01:48.358
are way better in Europe,

01:48.441 --> 01:50.068
and bluefin
is one of my passions.

01:50.151 --> 01:51.069
Wow! Okay,

01:51.152 --> 01:53.279
this is an insane,
incredible story.

01:53.363 --> 01:55.281
I'm just so grateful
you kept her safe. Thank you.

01:55.365 --> 01:57.826
Well, Megan
is a very special lady.

01:57.909 --> 02:00.161
I have a pretty big crush
on her, but that's a secret.

02:00.245 --> 02:03.998
- Don't tell anybody.
- Oh, stop it.

02:05.625 --> 02:07.669
- We just dance.
- Is that what they call it?

02:07.752 --> 02:09.295
- Jesus.
- Sorry.

02:11.172 --> 02:13.591
Oh, and also, I have a bounty
on my head--

02:13.675 --> 02:14.884
half a million for whoever

02:14.968 --> 02:16.427
turns me in
to the North Koreans.

02:16.511 --> 02:18.721
There's a man from Korea
hunting me.

02:18.805 --> 02:21.349
Can you believe it?
I'm a prize.

02:21.432 --> 02:22.350
I mean, it's terrifying,

02:22.433 --> 02:24.727
but who would have
thought--me, a prize?

02:24.811 --> 02:26.855
Of course I can believe it.
Look what you've accomplished.

02:26.938 --> 02:27.897
Of course
you're a fucking prize,

02:27.981 --> 02:29.232
like, top-shelf shit
right there.

02:29.315 --> 02:30.817
Okay, Cassie,

02:30.900 --> 02:33.361
that's the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

02:35.155 --> 02:36.573
Top shelf is right.

02:36.656 --> 02:37.782
Megan is just living it up

02:37.866 --> 02:39.868
like some sort of sparkly
fugitive pirate lady.

02:39.951 --> 02:42.287
I mean, she's wanted.
That should be me.

02:42.370 --> 02:43.705
Well, then the scary guy would
be trying to murder you

02:43.788 --> 02:44.831
instead of Megan.

02:44.914 --> 02:46.165
Don't spoil it.
Come on, God,

02:46.249 --> 02:47.667
I really got
the short end of the stick.

02:47.750 --> 02:50.879
Megan's got a sugar mama,
just bankrolling her with cash.

02:50.962 --> 02:54.048
How many black market bluefin
tuna boats does Marco own?

02:54.132 --> 02:55.341
You know what,
I'm sparkly, too,

02:55.425 --> 02:57.218
and I don't even need
dirty tuna money.

02:57.302 --> 02:59.679
All right?
Megan needs my help now.

02:59.762 --> 03:02.515
Seems kind of like you
need her to need your help.

03:02.599 --> 03:04.058
You know, it's a lot easier
to play hero

03:04.142 --> 03:05.310
instead of focusing
on your own shit.

03:05.393 --> 03:07.186
Listen, you're a child
and I used to be you.

03:07.270 --> 03:09.230
So stop trying to put
all this wisdom on me, okay?

03:09.314 --> 03:10.982
I have done the work
and I'm all better.

03:11.065 --> 03:12.817
March 21st.

03:12.901 --> 03:13.860
Yeah, what does that mean?

03:13.943 --> 03:15.320
How about March 23rd?

03:15.403 --> 03:18.281
Those are just dates.
Who cares?

03:19.365 --> 03:20.658
Oh.
Looks like we have a leak.

03:20.742 --> 03:22.160
We should probably head
to the hardware store.

03:22.243 --> 03:25.038
Oh, wait, your double
already did that for you.

03:25.121 --> 03:26.789
Fuck yes, we're doing shots.

03:26.873 --> 03:27.790
No, we're not. No.

03:27.874 --> 03:29.792
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

03:29.876 --> 03:31.127
I can't have that drink.
Oh, no, I'm not drinking.

03:31.210 --> 03:32.378
Thank you,
that's very generous of you,

03:32.462 --> 03:33.504
but I'm gonna--just gonna--

03:33.588 --> 03:34.881
I'm not gonna
have that tonight.

03:34.964 --> 03:36.257
You're being
impolite to our host, okay?

03:36.341 --> 03:38.092
It's just a shot.
Can you just...

03:38.176 --> 03:39.469
play being sober tomorrow?

03:39.552 --> 03:40.553
- No, I'm sober for real.

03:40.637 --> 03:42.347
A year, AA sober. I haven't
had a drink in a year.

03:42.430 --> 03:44.140
- Really?
- Really.

03:44.223 --> 03:47.435
Well, happy to help you
resolve your little spat.

03:47.518 --> 03:50.229
Now back to the
important stuff. It's ready.

03:53.191 --> 03:56.069
So, let me get this straight.
This man has been hunting you?

03:56.152 --> 03:57.403
He's relentless.

03:57.487 --> 03:59.322
He showed up
in Reykjavik last week.

03:59.405 --> 04:01.074
Okay, well, we've got to get
the fuck out of here.

04:01.157 --> 04:02.033
I have a plan.

04:02.116 --> 04:03.326
Charlie and I
have our own plan.

04:03.409 --> 04:05.161
- We're stopping him.
- For good.

04:05.244 --> 04:06.788
Sorry. What does that mean?

04:06.871 --> 04:08.998
We're gonna K-I-L-L him.

04:10.041 --> 04:12.126
Okay, spelling it
does not make it better.

04:12.210 --> 04:14.003
He's been coming in
every night.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.463
And we didn't know exactly
when we were gonna do it

04:15.546 --> 04:16.422
but now that you showed up,

04:16.506 --> 04:17.465
we're gonna have
to do it tonight.

04:17.548 --> 04:18.841
- What?
- When he comes,

04:18.925 --> 04:20.927
she's gonna fix him
his favorite cocktail

04:21.010 --> 04:23.513
with a little something extra
in it--poison mushrooms.

04:24.931 --> 04:28.810
A little gives you a trip,
a lot makes you dead.

04:28.893 --> 04:29.894
You're gonna do this tonight?

04:31.521 --> 04:32.480
Okay, that's Hak. Move.

04:32.563 --> 04:34.065
Wait. Who? Hak?

04:34.148 --> 04:36.067
Shane said that name.
I know that name.

05:41.049 --> 05:43.593
Sorry if he was
one of your friends.

05:43.676 --> 05:45.386
Anyhoo...

05:45.470 --> 05:46.346
miss me?

06:52.411 --> 06:54.831
Oh, my God.

06:54.914 --> 06:55.957
Who are you?

06:56.040 --> 06:56.958
Megan, Miranda. Miranda, Megan.

06:57.041 --> 06:58.417
I'm sure you'll be
besties in no time.

06:58.501 --> 07:00.795
Oh. Thank you.
Thank you very much.

07:00.878 --> 07:02.171
There was something
that was supposed to go down

07:02.255 --> 07:03.172
with poison mushrooms
and everything.

07:03.256 --> 07:04.423
- Poison mushrooms?
- Yes.

07:04.507 --> 07:05.800
So I'm here because
of poison mushrooms?

07:05.883 --> 07:07.135
No, not exact--

07:07.218 --> 07:09.637
No, my friend here,
she sold state secrets--

07:09.720 --> 07:11.347
Wait, what, the plan
was poison mushrooms?

07:11.430 --> 07:12.598
- Yes.
- It wasn't my plan.

07:12.682 --> 07:14.809
It was her plan.
My plan was to call you,

07:14.892 --> 07:17.270
which is why I sent you
this guy.

07:17.353 --> 07:19.313
Listen, it is so sweet
that you came out,

07:19.397 --> 07:20.648
but I just thought you were
gonna send someone else

07:20.731 --> 07:22.233
like a business associate
or something.

07:22.316 --> 07:24.110
Honestly,
I got bored being boss.

07:24.193 --> 07:25.278
You know,
I thought I'd be happy

07:25.361 --> 07:27.613
just telling a small army
of very bad people what to do.

07:27.697 --> 07:28.906
But you know,
it turns out I like the taste.

07:28.990 --> 07:31.492
So, when I got your little
note, I figured, what the fuck?

07:37.248 --> 07:38.291
- Okay. Yeah.
- Got it. Yep.

07:38.374 --> 07:39.709
Pat him down and get his ID.

07:39.792 --> 07:40.710
I'm sorry, what?

07:40.793 --> 07:42.003
I said pat him down
and get his ID.

07:42.086 --> 07:43.838
What? Pat him...

07:43.921 --> 07:46.716
Oh, my God.

07:46.799 --> 07:48.259
Oh, my God.

07:52.471 --> 07:53.472
This is Cecilia.

07:53.556 --> 07:56.350
Yes, I'm calling an audible.
Stabbed a, um...

07:56.434 --> 07:59.228
- North Korean spy.
- ...a North Korean spy,

07:59.312 --> 08:01.522
and I'm sure there's gonna be
plenty more where he came from,

08:01.606 --> 08:03.733
so we will not
be exiting out the front.

08:03.816 --> 08:07.028
We had a whole plan.
This is way above my pay grade.

08:07.111 --> 08:09.071
Okay, I'm sorry,
I can't hear you

08:09.155 --> 08:10.781
over the din of you eating
your double fried chips.

08:10.865 --> 08:12.700
Pregnancy cravings
and remote offices

08:12.783 --> 08:14.368
don't mix, Miranda.

08:14.452 --> 08:15.661
Yeah, we're going with
contingency B.

08:15.745 --> 08:17.580
Make it happen.
Thank you.

08:17.663 --> 08:19.373
Hak's friends are here
and they have guns.

08:19.457 --> 08:20.416
Lovely bar.
Nice to meet you.

08:20.499 --> 08:21.500
Thanks for looking out for me.

08:21.584 --> 08:24.086
Okay,
let's go this way, guys.

08:24.170 --> 08:25.087
Go.

08:34.472 --> 08:36.015
Get in the bus!

08:36.098 --> 08:37.433
Just get on the bus.

08:49.528 --> 08:50.988
Cass, is that you?

08:51.072 --> 08:52.114
They're waking up.

08:54.867 --> 08:56.118
Don't worry about it.

08:56.202 --> 08:57.787
If they get rowdy,
we'll just dose 'em again.

08:57.870 --> 08:59.914
- Stay focused.
- Almost had her at LAX,

08:59.997 --> 09:01.707
and then she just disappeared.

09:01.791 --> 09:04.210
I'm not getting fucked over
by a fucking flight attendant.

09:04.293 --> 09:06.087
Stay focused.

09:06.170 --> 09:07.213
- Hey, babe.
- Yeah.

09:07.296 --> 09:08.756
- You awake?
- Yeah.

09:08.839 --> 09:11.008
- My head really hurts.
- Yeah.

09:14.387 --> 09:16.555
Are those
the fucking neighbors?

09:16.639 --> 09:17.848
Yeah.

09:17.932 --> 09:18.933
"Hi there,
welcome to the neighborhood.

09:19.016 --> 09:20.726
We roofied the fuck
out of you."

09:22.270 --> 09:23.312
I'll check the rooms.

09:25.022 --> 09:26.649
See her hair.

09:26.732 --> 09:28.150
It's blonde.

09:28.234 --> 09:29.902
Max, what if
she's the double Cassie?

09:29.986 --> 09:31.904
- Shit, this is really bad.
- Yeah.

09:31.988 --> 09:32.905
This is really--

09:32.989 --> 09:35.908
What are you--
what are you doing?

09:35.992 --> 09:38.035
I'm gonna--
I'm gonna cut these zip ties

09:38.119 --> 09:39.328
with my shoelaces.

09:39.412 --> 09:41.289
How do you know
that that's a thing?

09:41.372 --> 09:43.249
- YouTube.
- Oh, okay, great.

09:43.332 --> 09:44.667
That's, like,
a super reliable source.

09:44.750 --> 09:46.919
I'm sorry, slipping out
of zip ties isn't as easy

09:47.003 --> 09:48.170
as slipping off a ring.

09:48.254 --> 09:49.255
Are you kidding me?
You want to talk

09:49.338 --> 09:50.589
- about that right now?
- No.

09:50.673 --> 09:52.049
- But if I did, I'd tell you--

09:52.133 --> 09:53.342
Oh, my God! Stop!

09:53.426 --> 09:55.136
- Get the fuck up.
- Max!

09:55.219 --> 09:56.178
We're looking
all over the place

09:56.262 --> 09:57.638
and we're not finding shit.
Okay?

09:57.722 --> 09:59.098
So I'm gonna ask you
very clearly--

09:59.181 --> 10:01.851
- where is Cassie Bowden?
- She is on a flight.

10:01.934 --> 10:03.602
Bullshit! 'Cause we checked
every manifest

10:03.686 --> 10:06.188
and she isn't
listed anywhere.

10:06.272 --> 10:08.024
Would the both of you like
to be all bruised up

10:08.107 --> 10:09.150
for your wedding pictures?

10:09.233 --> 10:10.401
Dude, I wouldn't hold
my breath for that.

10:10.484 --> 10:11.610
- Shut the fuck up.
- What you say, soy boy?

10:11.694 --> 10:13.529
Don't hit him. We don't know
where the fuck she is, okay?

10:13.612 --> 10:15.156
Baby, stop.

10:15.239 --> 10:18.200
You're gonna hurt your hand.
We have tools for that.

10:18.284 --> 10:20.536
- I'll be right back.
- Good point, babe.

10:30.504 --> 10:31.839
Sorry, it's tight in here,

10:31.922 --> 10:34.342
I don't think anyone's
following us, I don't think.

10:34.425 --> 10:35.468
Are you okay, by the way?

10:35.551 --> 10:36.635
No, I'm great. I'm great.
Yeah.

10:36.719 --> 10:38.346
I've just been shot
in the leg, again.

10:38.429 --> 10:40.890
I'm so hot.
I'm having a hot flash.

10:40.973 --> 10:42.850
How are you hot?
It's fucking freezing in here.

10:42.933 --> 10:45.353
Cassie, when a woman reaches
a certain age,

10:45.436 --> 10:46.604
her body starts to change.

10:46.687 --> 10:48.856
Would you like to hear my full
TED talk on the subject?

10:48.939 --> 10:49.815
- No.
- Absolutely not.

10:49.899 --> 10:51.650
- Actually, fuck no. No.
- Really don't.

10:54.987 --> 10:56.405
Okay. How are you?

10:56.489 --> 10:58.199
I left behind a woman

10:58.282 --> 11:00.368
who is impersonating me
internationally

11:00.451 --> 11:02.995
and actually blowing things up
all over the world.

11:03.079 --> 11:05.831
Wait a minute, somebody's
committing crimes as you,

11:05.915 --> 11:07.833
and you flew to Iceland.

11:07.917 --> 11:10.044
Listen, it's
a big, tough situation,

11:10.127 --> 11:11.420
but I'm handling it.

11:11.504 --> 11:14.423
Right. Sure.
How exactly?

11:14.507 --> 11:16.509
- Again with the phone?

11:16.592 --> 11:17.551
Okay, I'm sorry,
I have to answer this,

11:17.635 --> 11:19.428
It's an AA friend,
it's part of the package.

11:20.638 --> 11:22.056
- Jenny?
- Hi, Cassie.

11:22.139 --> 11:23.224
Is this a bad time?

11:23.307 --> 11:24.892
Uh, no,
it's a wonderful time.

11:24.975 --> 11:27.228
Are you okay?
You've called a lot, so...

11:27.311 --> 11:28.604
Okay, I have this podcast.

11:28.687 --> 11:30.439
Podcast?
No, Jenny,

11:30.523 --> 11:31.482
please don't tell me
that's why

11:31.565 --> 11:33.234
you've been
calling me incessantly.

11:33.317 --> 11:34.819
No, I can't do a podcast.

11:34.902 --> 11:37.613
It's not my thing.
It's--it's a bad time, okay?

11:37.697 --> 11:38.739
After everything you
went through in Thailand?

11:38.823 --> 11:40.449
I mean, it was all over
the news.

11:40.533 --> 11:41.909
No, I've got a lot going on

11:41.992 --> 11:42.910
and I'm in the middle
of a situation.

11:42.993 --> 11:44.954
I'm gonna have to text you.
I'm sorry.

11:47.373 --> 11:48.791
- Cassie.
- Yes.

11:48.874 --> 11:50.793
If anyone asks you to do
a podcast about this,

11:50.876 --> 11:51.961
you better say no.

11:52.044 --> 11:53.921
I'm not going
to be telling anyone

11:54.004 --> 11:55.631
that I misconstrued
a few emojis,

11:55.714 --> 11:57.800
flew to Iceland to hang out
with you on a bus.

11:58.717 --> 12:00.177
Not gonna tell anyone that.

12:05.808 --> 12:07.935
There better be something
amongst all this shit.

12:11.272 --> 12:12.982
You know, this bounty
won't wait forever.

12:13.065 --> 12:14.233
There's other people
looking for her.

12:14.316 --> 12:16.152
Don't worry about it.

12:16.235 --> 12:17.486
Everybody talks.

12:24.702 --> 12:26.162
Now you've seen
the instruments.

12:26.245 --> 12:27.746
You guys are psychos.

12:27.830 --> 12:29.498
No, we're fully sane.

12:29.582 --> 12:30.541
We just care about money

12:30.624 --> 12:31.750
more than we care about your
comfort.

12:31.834 --> 12:34.295
Actually, we don't care
about you at all.

12:34.378 --> 12:37.131
Now the output of this taser
is 50,000 volts.

12:37.214 --> 12:39.633
At that level,
it'll just immobilize you.

12:39.717 --> 12:41.469
But if you turn it down
a little bit...

12:43.888 --> 12:45.222
...it just
really fucking hurts.

12:45.306 --> 12:47.266
Oh, shit. Holy shit!

12:47.349 --> 12:48.601
- Whoa.
- Hey, Max.

12:48.684 --> 12:49.685
Max, Max, Max.

12:49.768 --> 12:50.978
Max, babe, hey, hey.

12:51.061 --> 12:52.313
I love you. Okay?

12:52.396 --> 12:54.690
I love you, so much.
And I'm so sorry.

12:54.774 --> 12:56.317
I'm so sorry, I know
you're really mad right now

12:56.400 --> 12:57.818
'cause I fucked up,
and I know you're really mad

12:57.902 --> 12:59.361
'cause you're really bad
at hiding it.

12:59.445 --> 13:01.280
Sorry.
That was a criticism,

13:01.363 --> 13:02.281
and I didn't mean it
like that.

13:02.364 --> 13:05.451
It's just--I'm just--
I'm bad....at...

13:05.534 --> 13:06.702
like...feelings!

13:06.785 --> 13:08.871
Hey, hey, it's be gonna okay,
okay? We're gonna be okay.

13:08.954 --> 13:10.998
- We're gonna be totally okay.
- No, no. Totally.

13:11.081 --> 13:12.166
But like, if it's not fine

13:12.249 --> 13:13.751
and like, you know,
we fucking die,

13:13.834 --> 13:14.877
I just really need you to know

13:14.960 --> 13:16.378
that I'm, like,
not okay right now

13:16.462 --> 13:18.214
about, like, you know,
everything,

13:18.297 --> 13:20.591
like, work and moving,
and, you know, us.

13:20.674 --> 13:22.426
And like,
what does our future look like

13:22.510 --> 13:23.427
after I did all this shit?

13:23.511 --> 13:25.513
Like, you know,
I lied and I did fraud

13:25.596 --> 13:27.014
and I worked for the mob.

13:27.097 --> 13:29.058
And, like helped people
who kill people and--

13:29.141 --> 13:30.726
What do you--what do you mean,
mob? The mob?

13:33.729 --> 13:35.814
- Yeah, yeah.
- Big time.

13:35.898 --> 13:36.899
Totally big time, yeah.

13:36.982 --> 13:38.234
Like, I did all this stuff
for them.

13:38.317 --> 13:40.152
That's...yeah.
So, you're, like, intimidated

13:40.236 --> 13:43.822
by, um, very dangerous people
insisting on payback

13:43.906 --> 13:45.574
if you were to be, like,
framing our friend

13:45.658 --> 13:46.909
or like, we were to get hurt,
that's smart.

13:46.992 --> 13:49.495
That's totally...
That's super smart.

13:49.578 --> 13:51.622
Okay.
That's obviously a bluff.

13:51.705 --> 13:54.625
Nice try. What are you
talking about, framing?

13:54.708 --> 13:56.669
You know what? I don't care.

13:56.752 --> 13:58.170
- So, here we go.
- What? No.

13:58.254 --> 13:59.755
No, hey, no, no, no.

14:03.050 --> 14:04.009
I found something.

14:05.135 --> 14:06.679
She's in Iceland.

14:20.109 --> 14:22.111
- Hey, what is this place?
- Sky Lagoon.

14:22.194 --> 14:23.654
The water's really good for
your skin. It's super relaxing.

14:23.737 --> 14:25.447
-No.

14:25.531 --> 14:28.158
Okay, no spa day
for us today, ladies.

14:28.242 --> 14:29.243
Excuse me!

14:35.332 --> 14:37.084
How do you think
they even found us here?

14:37.167 --> 14:39.878
I, uh--I can solve
that little mystery.

14:39.962 --> 14:42.298
- This is Cecilia.
- Hey.

14:42.381 --> 14:44.633
Care to explain, Cecilia?

14:44.717 --> 14:45.634
Sure.

14:45.718 --> 14:47.553
I have a baby on the way
and the bounty

14:47.636 --> 14:50.306
on Megan Briscoe's head
pays way more than you do.

14:50.389 --> 14:51.932
Is this you asking
for a fucking raise?

14:52.016 --> 14:55.144
I'm not gonna dodge bullets
for you at this day rate.

14:55.227 --> 14:58.063
Well, stick to plan B and then
maybe we'll talk, okay?

14:58.147 --> 14:59.648
All right.
Cecilia has betrayed us,

14:59.732 --> 15:01.984
but it's all gonna be fine.
Don't--don't worry about it.

15:02.067 --> 15:03.402
Wait.
They're right there.

15:03.485 --> 15:04.486
They're right there.
They're right there.

15:04.570 --> 15:05.487
- Go back. Go back.
- Run, run, run!

15:11.619 --> 15:13.120
Here, here, here.
In here.

15:14.371 --> 15:15.706
Hot sauna. Hot sauna.

15:15.789 --> 15:17.750
There's got to be
an exit somewhere.

15:31.472 --> 15:32.806
- Oh!

16:07.633 --> 16:09.468
Okay, what are we
supposed to do now?

16:09.551 --> 16:11.512
I don't know,
but running isn't working.

16:11.595 --> 16:12.721
We need to steal a boat.

16:12.805 --> 16:15.265
-- A what?!
-- A boat. Down there.

16:27.820 --> 16:30.280
Should we let the North Koreans
know that we have a lead?

16:30.364 --> 16:31.615
A lead won't get us the bounty.

16:31.699 --> 16:34.326
We need eyes on
Megan Briscoe in Iceland first.

16:37.246 --> 16:38.747
Megan Briscoe?

16:38.831 --> 16:41.458
Like, Cassie's flight attendant
friend, Megan Briscoe?

16:41.542 --> 16:43.335
Why the hell would you
home-invade Cassie's place

16:43.419 --> 16:45.879
if you're just...looking...

16:45.963 --> 16:48.048
Wait. Do you think they're
not even after Cassie?

16:48.132 --> 16:49.425
I don't know who they're after,

16:49.508 --> 16:51.009
but we're sitting ducks here.

16:52.636 --> 16:54.388
Max, that's very loud.

17:16.869 --> 17:18.120
I know
I haven't known you long,

17:18.203 --> 17:19.955
but you two have some
serious relationship shit

17:20.038 --> 17:21.373
you need to work out.

17:21.457 --> 17:22.791
So long, lovebirds.

17:22.875 --> 17:23.959
Oh, by the way,

17:24.042 --> 17:25.669
if you call the police,
we'll kill you.

17:27.087 --> 17:28.047
Ciao.

17:44.438 --> 17:46.023
Okay. You okay?

17:46.106 --> 17:47.983
I'm sorry I took off the ring.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.318
I'm sorry
you took off the ring, too.

17:49.401 --> 17:50.778
Just...

17:50.861 --> 17:52.321
stay here, okay?

17:58.035 --> 17:59.578
Okay.

17:59.661 --> 18:03.832
So, psychotic couple
is just using Cassie

18:03.916 --> 18:05.876
to find someone named Megan?

18:05.959 --> 18:07.086
Why blow up a car?

18:07.169 --> 18:08.629
Maybe they had nothing
to do with the bombing.

18:08.712 --> 18:11.173
I mean, they didn't seem
that focused on Cassie at all.

18:11.256 --> 18:15.177
Okay, so,
if that unhinged blonde bimbo

18:15.260 --> 18:19.515
isn't the View-Master double,
then who the fuck is, Max?

18:59.763 --> 19:00.848
Come on, come on, come on.

19:00.931 --> 19:02.307
Okay, okay, okay.

19:02.391 --> 19:04.351
Oh, my God.
Just one--give me one...

19:04.434 --> 19:05.561
- I gotta take this.
- No, what the fuck?

19:05.644 --> 19:08.063
We are literally on a cliff!

19:08.146 --> 19:09.523
How do you have
service right now?

19:09.606 --> 19:11.066
- Who's your provider?
- I actually don't.

19:11.149 --> 19:12.484
Just once second.
Shane, hi.

19:12.568 --> 19:13.902
Can I please
lead with the fact

19:13.986 --> 19:15.404
that I have
not called to fight?

19:15.487 --> 19:16.572
I'm not answering to fight.

19:17.906 --> 19:20.909
Look, Cassie, uh,
I made some assumptions.

19:20.993 --> 19:22.619
- Cassie!
- Maybe I shouldn't have,

19:22.703 --> 19:24.288
but I've never
not closed a case,

19:24.371 --> 19:27.082
so I don't know.
Year two of this Megan thing

19:27.165 --> 19:28.125
has got me on edge.

19:28.208 --> 19:31.503
Cassie! Ask Shane
why he's asking about Hak!

19:31.587 --> 19:33.088
- Who is that?
- Uh, nothing.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.840
Just an angry tourist.
There's a lot of them.

19:36.174 --> 19:37.885
Look, I just wanted
to make sure you're okay.

19:39.344 --> 19:40.429
So sweet.
Yes, thank you.

19:40.512 --> 19:42.264
I am--I am--I am okay.

19:42.347 --> 19:44.558
It's just, it's very
complicated right now.

19:44.641 --> 19:46.768
Well, if you were ever
in any trouble,

19:46.852 --> 19:49.771
you know
you just come to me, right?

19:49.855 --> 19:50.856
Honestly, if I was in trouble,

19:50.939 --> 19:52.733
you'd be the first person
I would call.

19:52.816 --> 19:55.444
Cassie, I, um...

19:55.527 --> 19:58.488
I'm gonna try to let
what I do not come between us.

19:58.572 --> 20:00.574
Would you please do the same?

20:00.657 --> 20:04.077
And remember, I'm--I'm
right here. Phone call away.

20:04.161 --> 20:06.747
All right. Love you.

20:06.830 --> 20:08.790
- Bye.
- Wait--

20:09.583 --> 20:12.085
-Cassie! Ca--
- Sorry.

20:12.169 --> 20:13.420
- Oh, my goodness!
- Okay, sorry.

20:13.503 --> 20:15.255
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

20:40.656 --> 20:43.367
Megan Briscoe, most likely
traveling with a blonde.

20:43.450 --> 20:45.202
Give me eyes
on all the airports.

20:50.666 --> 20:51.708
They went through my purse.

20:51.792 --> 20:53.085
Yeah, I think they went
through everything.

20:53.168 --> 20:56.171
No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no. No, where are you?

20:56.254 --> 20:57.631
It's okay.
Look, it's just stuff.

20:57.714 --> 20:59.299
We can replace stuff.
I'm glad you're okay.

20:59.383 --> 21:00.717
Max...

21:00.801 --> 21:02.511
when I took
the ring off earlier...

21:02.594 --> 21:04.429
Yeah, Annie,
I remember that part.

21:04.513 --> 21:06.056
I put it in here.

21:08.976 --> 21:11.770
Fuck. Those motherfuckers
took my ring.

21:19.695 --> 21:21.655
- Okay.

21:22.781 --> 21:25.409
- Okay.
- Max.

21:30.372 --> 21:31.623
Max, what are you doing?

21:40.173 --> 21:43.301
Those assholes
left their door open.

21:44.136 --> 21:46.304
Do you see them?

21:46.388 --> 21:48.974
No.

21:49.057 --> 21:50.851
Okay, come on.

22:36.772 --> 22:38.148
Oh, my God!

22:38.231 --> 22:39.983
Oh, my God! Oh!

22:40.067 --> 22:41.985
Oh, my God!
Are you okay?

22:42.069 --> 22:45.489
Are you okay?
Max, call 911!

22:50.952 --> 22:54.748
Oh!

23:00.087 --> 23:01.046
Are you ready to...

23:03.090 --> 23:05.008
Uh, okay, sorry.
I'll give you a second.

23:10.347 --> 23:13.141
Oh, no, they shot you.

23:13.225 --> 23:15.435
You did not say
that you got shot.

23:15.519 --> 23:17.729
No, well, what did you think
was gonna happen, Cecilia?

23:17.813 --> 23:20.232
Now, did you get
everything I requested?

23:20.315 --> 23:22.150
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you.

23:22.234 --> 23:23.443
Now you can locate

23:23.527 --> 23:25.987
and train your replacement
so I can kill you.

23:26.071 --> 23:27.989
What, you really think
you can replace me?

23:28.073 --> 23:30.909
Who else can organize your
international crime syndicate

23:30.992 --> 23:33.161
and always make sure

23:33.245 --> 23:35.664
that you have a matcha latte?

23:35.747 --> 23:37.624
Which, by the way,
is not an easy find in Iceland.

23:37.707 --> 23:39.459
Oh, fucking hell!

23:39.543 --> 23:43.130
Megan, you have to go.
I get it.

23:43.213 --> 23:46.049
But...

23:46.133 --> 23:48.969
let me give you this.

23:49.052 --> 23:50.178
Charlie, no.

23:50.262 --> 23:52.264
I can't be with you
to protect you,

23:52.347 --> 23:53.849
so it would mean a lot

23:53.932 --> 23:57.686
if you had a little bit of me
to take with you.

23:57.769 --> 23:58.854
Thank you.

24:00.438 --> 24:01.398
And this.

24:05.443 --> 24:07.696
- Bluefin bucks.

24:07.779 --> 24:11.324
And some poison
mushroom powder, just in case.

24:11.408 --> 24:13.076
I picked a lot of mushrooms,
huh?

24:18.248 --> 24:21.751
Thank you, Charlie,
for everything.

24:23.086 --> 24:24.963
Who will I dance with now?

24:25.046 --> 24:26.006
Aw!

24:35.056 --> 24:36.057
Ugh.

24:36.141 --> 24:37.309
Okay, listen,
I'm just trying to watch

24:37.392 --> 24:38.977
Megan's Casablanca goodbye,

24:39.060 --> 24:40.770
and I'm in here doing this?

24:42.355 --> 24:44.316
Do you need help or anything?

24:44.399 --> 24:46.109
Do you
need help or anything?

24:46.193 --> 24:47.402
I mean,
that's the real question.

24:47.485 --> 24:49.321
I'm not the one doing
some weird balancing act

24:49.404 --> 24:50.989
for something
that's gonna fall apart anyway.

24:51.072 --> 24:52.199
Wow.

24:52.282 --> 24:54.409
I'm an alcoholic teenager,
and even I think

24:54.492 --> 24:57.120
the metaphor here
is pretty obvious.

24:57.204 --> 24:58.205
Good luck.

25:01.625 --> 25:04.252
Where is all this water
coming from?

25:04.336 --> 25:06.254
The lady in the gold dress
said someone upstairs

25:06.338 --> 25:07.756
probably left
their bathtub running.

25:07.839 --> 25:10.175
Wait, what?
What did you just say?

25:10.258 --> 25:12.636
She said it must be, like,
flowing onto the floor,

25:12.719 --> 25:14.012
like they passed out
or something,

25:14.095 --> 25:15.931
and now water
is just splashing everywhere.

25:21.561 --> 25:24.356
- Okay.
- Okay.

25:29.319 --> 25:30.737
Thank you.

25:36.451 --> 25:37.577
Are you okay?

25:40.497 --> 25:41.706
All right, let's go.

25:41.790 --> 25:43.333
The plane's waiting
in the hangar.

25:46.836 --> 25:48.505
I'm sorry,
you look so familiar.

25:48.588 --> 25:49.714
Have we met?

25:49.798 --> 25:51.007
No.

26:06.022 --> 26:07.399
Hildegard Bouffant?

26:07.482 --> 26:10.235
Well, if you don't like it,
then feel free to use your own

26:10.318 --> 26:12.320
carefully crafted
fake identity.

26:13.446 --> 26:15.073
Hildegard's just fine.

26:15.156 --> 26:17.409
Oh, and neither of you need
to use the clothes

26:17.492 --> 26:20.996
that I brought you, but you
should definitely dig in

26:21.079 --> 26:23.081
'cause yellow is not your--

26:23.164 --> 26:24.457
Fucking hell!

26:25.500 --> 26:26.418
Okay, listen.

26:26.501 --> 26:27.919
The name is horrible,
but it works.

26:28.003 --> 26:30.005
She knows what she's doing.
I put together a list of things

26:30.088 --> 26:31.214
we gotta do
when we get back to LA

26:31.298 --> 26:32.924
to get you home,
get you to your family.

26:33.008 --> 26:35.385
- Don't talk about my family.
- No, we need to. We need to--

26:35.468 --> 26:36.970
No, Cassie. I don't--

26:38.555 --> 26:39.514
What?

26:41.057 --> 26:43.518
Do you know
how hard it's been?

26:43.601 --> 26:45.020
Not being with my family
for a year?

26:45.103 --> 26:47.230
It's--it's felt like decades,
okay?

26:47.314 --> 26:49.524
And yes, I miss them.
Yes, I want to see them.

26:49.607 --> 26:51.526
But do they want to see me?

26:51.609 --> 26:53.570
Do I even want to drag them
back into this?

26:53.653 --> 26:57.574
I mean, do I? Now that
I'm just on my way back home...

26:57.657 --> 26:59.701
- Listen, listen to me.
- ...I'm just freaking out.

26:59.784 --> 27:03.455
I know they miss you and
they are desperate to see you.

27:03.538 --> 27:05.957
Okay.

27:06.041 --> 27:07.876
It's just...

27:07.959 --> 27:09.044
I just...

27:09.127 --> 27:11.004
You're gonna be okay.
It is okay, all right?

27:11.087 --> 27:12.005
- I just--

27:12.088 --> 27:15.050
Oh, my God!
Jesus, Marco.

27:15.133 --> 27:17.135
Who's Marco?

27:17.218 --> 27:19.888
Um, my boyfriend.

27:19.971 --> 27:21.723
- Your boyfriend?
- Yeah.

27:21.806 --> 27:24.059
So he, you know, he just keeps
asking me where I am.

27:24.142 --> 27:25.477
It's like,
"Well, where are you?"

27:25.560 --> 27:27.062
But what am I supposed to say?
Like, "Hey, babe, sorry,

27:27.145 --> 27:28.480
"I jetted off to Iceland and

27:28.563 --> 27:30.231
"played a human game
of Mousetrap

27:30.315 --> 27:31.524
"and tried to save my friend

27:31.608 --> 27:32.525
"and saved her.
We're on our way back,

27:32.609 --> 27:35.153
and I can't tell you
anything else, so..."

27:35.236 --> 27:37.322
How about you just say

27:37.405 --> 27:39.199
"I'm okay,
I'll see you soon."

27:39.282 --> 27:41.034
- It's gonna work.
- I know, but I just...

27:41.117 --> 27:43.536
I don't want to lie to him,
again. I--

27:45.413 --> 27:48.541
Look at me. Look at us.
I need a drink so bad.

27:48.625 --> 27:49.918
Do you know
how badly I want a drink?

27:50.001 --> 27:53.004
I want a drink so bad
so I can forget all of this.

27:53.088 --> 27:54.798
You're really sober?

27:54.881 --> 27:56.174
Cassie.

27:56.257 --> 27:57.592
Cassie,
that is so impressive.

27:57.675 --> 27:59.844
- Oh, no. Come on, it's--
- Really, it is.

28:01.679 --> 28:02.806
I missed you.

28:05.892 --> 28:07.519
I missed you, too.

28:07.602 --> 28:10.438
- Thank you.
- Always.

28:13.858 --> 28:15.026
- I'm gonna sleep.
- Okay.

28:26.996 --> 28:28.623
Hey. All right.
I gotta tell you,

28:28.706 --> 28:30.417
I really appreciate
what you're doing for us.

28:30.500 --> 28:31.584
Seriously,
you really came through.

28:31.668 --> 28:33.378
Um, but here's the thing,
I gotta get Megan back

28:33.461 --> 28:35.046
to her family
in Long Island, okay?

28:35.130 --> 28:37.465
And I was hoping that
maybe you could, like--

28:37.549 --> 28:39.884
Cassie, Cassie, Cassie.

28:39.968 --> 28:42.512
All righty.
I find you fascinating.

28:42.595 --> 28:44.347
I seriously, honestly, I do.

28:44.431 --> 28:46.307
But no more
Miranda Ex Machina.

28:46.391 --> 28:48.351
- What?
- And also, Long Island?

28:48.435 --> 28:49.686
No, no.

28:49.769 --> 28:51.896
Come on!
Don't you want to, like,

28:51.980 --> 28:53.648
get back in the saddle again?

28:53.731 --> 28:54.899
You know, I genuinely thought
I did want to get

28:54.983 --> 28:58.319
back in the saddle,
but I forgot how...

28:58.403 --> 28:59.779
good you are
at getting into trouble,

28:59.863 --> 29:01.114
and I actually would quite like

29:01.197 --> 29:02.615
to enjoy the fruit
of my labors.

29:02.699 --> 29:04.826
I'm a very wealthy
olive farmer.

29:04.909 --> 29:06.077
I want to chill by my pool

29:06.161 --> 29:11.458
and not get shot
in the fucking leg, again.

29:11.541 --> 29:13.668
- Same leg.
- I mean, what are the odds?

29:13.751 --> 29:14.919
- What are the odds?
- I--

29:15.003 --> 29:16.838
So, you can just go home
on your own,

29:16.921 --> 29:17.881
and solve your own drama,

29:17.964 --> 29:19.757
You're perfectly
capable of doing that.

29:19.841 --> 29:21.801
Fucking hell.

29:25.430 --> 29:27.474
What is that?

29:27.557 --> 29:29.517
What?
You got me a gift?

29:29.601 --> 29:31.102
You got me a gift?

29:31.186 --> 29:33.271
Cecilia bought it, wrapped it,
and brought it here,

29:33.354 --> 29:34.689
but I just handed it to you.

29:34.772 --> 29:36.983
So yeah, I did, I got you--
I got you a gift.

29:37.066 --> 29:40.403
Wow! I am impressed.
Let's see.

29:40.487 --> 29:41.654
- Mace?
- Yep.

29:41.738 --> 29:45.033
Oh.
Personal safety alarm.

29:45.116 --> 29:48.077
- Well, yeah. Of course.
- Thank you.

29:48.161 --> 29:50.663
Little olive oil.
Cold pressed, huh?

29:50.747 --> 29:52.540
- I pressed that.
- You did this?

29:52.624 --> 29:54.334
- I learnt how to press it.
- Wow.

29:59.797 --> 30:01.007
Listen.

30:01.090 --> 30:02.675
I'm gonna stash you
at my place, okay?

30:02.759 --> 30:05.136
We'll figure out
the next step after that.

30:05.220 --> 30:06.179
We are coming to you live

30:06.262 --> 30:07.263
with this breaking news.

30:07.347 --> 30:08.640
Then I can get the files from
Cherri and then--

30:08.723 --> 30:10.683
and then somehow make a deal
with the CIA or the FBI.

30:10.767 --> 30:12.936
In Echo Park, one of
our city's best-known parks,

30:13.019 --> 30:14.979
Hello. Are you
even listening to me?

30:15.063 --> 30:16.022
- Wait. Hold on.
- Police have discovered

30:16.105 --> 30:17.190
a horrific scene.

30:17.273 --> 30:19.150
Two bodies are being recovered

30:19.234 --> 30:22.570
from the bottom
of Echo Park Lake.

30:22.654 --> 30:24.656
Both victims were
found wrapped in tarps

30:24.739 --> 30:27.242
and weighted down
by heavy chains.

30:27.325 --> 30:28.743
Police have not been able

30:28.826 --> 30:31.621
to identify these victims
at this time.

30:31.704 --> 30:33.248
Authorities are on scene
and have indicated

30:33.331 --> 30:35.250
they will be here all night
searching for evidence

30:35.333 --> 30:37.043
in their murder investigation.

30:37.126 --> 30:38.962
Oh, wow.
That looks like everything

30:39.045 --> 30:40.421
that was bought
on your credit card, right?

30:40.505 --> 30:42.048
Details are thin,
but we have been told--

30:42.131 --> 30:43.591
How much do you want to bet
that killer

30:43.675 --> 30:45.426
looks exactly like...

30:45.510 --> 30:47.178
Me.

30:47.262 --> 30:48.137
Fuck.

30:48.221 --> 30:49.180
We will continue
to bring you live updates

30:49.264 --> 30:50.223
as this story develops.

31:02.151 --> 31:03.111
Thank you.

31:04.195 --> 31:06.197
Cassie. Are you okay?
Where are you?

31:06.281 --> 31:07.574
Hi. Just hold on.
One second.

31:07.657 --> 31:08.575
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

31:08.658 --> 31:10.076
Um, I'm--
I'm not okay.

31:10.159 --> 31:11.953
I'm not okay, but I'm back.
So, wait a minute.

31:12.036 --> 31:13.955
You sound weird. What's wrong?
What happened?

31:14.038 --> 31:15.582
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah. Don't freak out.

31:15.665 --> 31:17.166
It's just, you know,
some crazy shit went down

31:17.250 --> 31:18.501
with the neighbors
and the police were here.

31:18.585 --> 31:20.420
Oh, my God, no.
What happened? Are you okay?

31:20.503 --> 31:22.171
Yes, it's fine. We'll tell you
all about it when we see you.

31:22.255 --> 31:23.339
Did you connect with Marco?

31:23.423 --> 31:24.424
Okay, listen,
if something went down

31:24.507 --> 31:26.009
and the police were there,
then we have to meet

31:26.092 --> 31:27.594
somewhere else,
literally anywhere else.

31:27.677 --> 31:29.679
- Did you say police?
- No, just go. Hold on.

31:29.762 --> 31:31.639
Wait, what?
Oh, whatever.

31:31.723 --> 31:32.974
I'll have Max pick a place
and I'll text you.

31:33.057 --> 31:34.225
Call Marco.

31:34.309 --> 31:36.352
Okay, okay. Text me. Bye.

31:37.812 --> 31:39.272
- Welcome to Westwood.
- Westwood?

31:39.355 --> 31:40.815
I thought
we were going to your place.

31:40.898 --> 31:42.567
- Where are we?
- We had to take a detour.

31:42.650 --> 31:43.943
Megan, I love you
more than anything,

31:44.027 --> 31:45.987
but I am barely holding on
to my own shit right now,

31:46.070 --> 31:47.614
so I really need you
to trust me.

31:47.697 --> 31:48.906
Okay.

31:48.990 --> 31:50.533
- Let's go.
- Okay.

31:54.078 --> 31:55.246
- Cassie.
- Hi.

31:55.330 --> 31:56.372
- Come in.
- Okay.

31:56.456 --> 31:58.416
And hello to you, too,
Cassie's friend.

31:58.499 --> 32:01.002
- I'm Brenda.
- Hi, I'm...Hildegard.

32:01.085 --> 32:03.504
Lovely to meet you, Hildegard.

32:03.588 --> 32:04.547
Nice to meet you, too.

32:04.631 --> 32:06.841
Um, I'm sorry, it was
a really long car ride.

32:06.924 --> 32:08.384
Do you mind
if I use your bathroom?

32:08.468 --> 32:09.677
Oh, not at all.

32:09.761 --> 32:12.013
Down the hall, right there.

32:14.140 --> 32:15.808
Oh. So appreciate you
doing this. Thank you.

32:15.892 --> 32:17.268
And if I'm putting you out
in any way,

32:17.352 --> 32:18.811
will you just say so?

32:18.895 --> 32:20.021
I'm your sponsor.

32:20.104 --> 32:22.190
Putting me out is your job,

32:22.273 --> 32:25.985
but I need you
to be up-front with me.

32:26.069 --> 32:28.363
- What's going on here?
- Okay.

32:28.446 --> 32:31.366
So, um, Hildegard
is a good friend of mine

32:31.449 --> 32:33.534
and she's having family issues

32:33.618 --> 32:34.619
and I'm trying to, you know,

32:34.702 --> 32:38.414
do my acts of service
sort of thing,

32:38.498 --> 32:39.916
trying to be of service.
Also, quick question--

32:39.999 --> 32:41.751
do you have any Hot Tamales
around here by any chance?

32:41.834 --> 32:43.753
Like, any sort of candy,
like, that you hide

32:43.836 --> 32:46.297
- that I could have?
- No, not really a staple.

32:46.381 --> 32:48.633
But, Cassie,
how are you doing?

32:48.716 --> 32:50.927
Good. I'm doing good. Thank
you. Thank you for asking.

32:51.010 --> 32:52.512
Thank you. I'm really--I'm
really, really, really good.

32:52.595 --> 32:55.181
Okay.
Your vibe is very manic.

32:55.264 --> 32:58.267
So I am not going to accept
that answer.

32:58.351 --> 33:00.269
Let's try this again.

33:00.353 --> 33:02.605
How are you doing, Cassie?

33:02.689 --> 33:06.484
Well, I'm, um...
trying to be a hero

33:06.567 --> 33:10.571
and I'm holding on so tight
that my hands are burning,

33:10.655 --> 33:12.031
and I would really
like a drink,

33:12.115 --> 33:12.990
but I didn't have a drink.

33:13.074 --> 33:14.617
So, yay me.

33:14.701 --> 33:16.661
And, um, yeah, I feel like

33:16.744 --> 33:18.830
I'm maybe
one little tiny accident

33:18.913 --> 33:20.373
away from a complete collapse.

33:20.456 --> 33:22.041
This whole sobriety thing,

33:22.125 --> 33:23.626
it's never not hard.

33:23.710 --> 33:24.836
Should it feel like...

33:24.919 --> 33:29.090
like walking a tightrope
above a pit of broken glass

33:29.173 --> 33:31.884
that I'm about to, like,
completely fall into?

33:31.968 --> 33:33.219
Only sometimes.

33:33.302 --> 33:35.304
- Only sometimes?
- Hmm.

33:35.388 --> 33:37.849
- Good.
- You look tired.

33:37.932 --> 33:39.976
- What?
- You look like my oldest child

33:40.059 --> 33:42.895
after she saved me
from asphyxiating in the pool.

33:42.979 --> 33:44.731
Oh, my God!

33:44.814 --> 33:47.108
How are you alive?
I don't understand.

33:47.191 --> 33:48.276
I didn't drown.

33:48.359 --> 33:49.861
- Yay!
- Obviously.

33:49.944 --> 33:51.863
- Oh.
- Calm down.

33:51.946 --> 33:53.448
And I'll
keep your friend here.

33:53.531 --> 33:55.366
- Thank you.
- But only for one night.

33:55.450 --> 33:56.784
Thank you.

33:56.868 --> 33:58.411
I'm going to make some tea.

33:58.494 --> 33:59.579
Okay, okay.

34:04.041 --> 34:05.418
- Cassie.
- Hey.

34:06.294 --> 34:08.463
I need to get
to Long Island now.

34:08.546 --> 34:10.173
Okay, I understand, but you
have to stay here one night.

34:10.256 --> 34:11.758
People are after you.
It's very dangerous.

34:11.841 --> 34:13.092
- Cassie. Cassie.
- You have to be very careful.

34:13.176 --> 34:15.219
I have been on the run
by myself

34:15.303 --> 34:17.263
without your help for a year.

34:17.346 --> 34:18.598
I need that evidence,

34:18.681 --> 34:20.850
specifically before someone
murders me.

34:20.933 --> 34:21.934
- Shh. Okay.
- No, listen!

34:22.018 --> 34:23.686
It's the only way
I'm gonna get out of this mess.

34:23.770 --> 34:25.480
I understand. Listen, you have
to stay for one night.

34:25.563 --> 34:26.439
- I'm not staying.
- Yes, you are.

34:26.522 --> 34:27.440
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

34:27.523 --> 34:28.483
She is going to help you.

34:28.566 --> 34:29.901
I'm not gonna stay
with that kooky lady.

34:29.984 --> 34:31.319
She's not kooky,
she's making you tea.

34:31.402 --> 34:32.487
Now listen to me.

34:32.570 --> 34:34.113
I'm gonna come back tomorrow.

34:34.197 --> 34:35.156
You're gonna keep this.

34:35.239 --> 34:37.241
This is mace.
Do not mace Brenda.

34:37.325 --> 34:38.826
I'm gonna come back tomorrow,
I'm gonna pick you up.

34:38.910 --> 34:41.162
One night. Please.

34:48.669 --> 34:50.797
I still cannot believe
you guys were held hostage.

34:50.880 --> 34:52.340
More like prisoners,
because they didn't want

34:52.423 --> 34:53.716
a ransom or anything like...

34:53.800 --> 34:55.343
Ow. Okay.

34:55.426 --> 34:57.094
- Babe, careful.
- Yeah.

34:57.178 --> 34:58.096
I mean, it was crazy.

34:58.179 --> 34:59.180
We fully thought this lady
was your double.

34:59.263 --> 35:00.556
I mean, all of a sudden,
she was just blonde.

35:00.640 --> 35:02.517
But then we realized
they were just after Megan

35:02.600 --> 35:04.101
and they're hot on her trail.

35:04.185 --> 35:05.311
I am so glad you're okay.

35:05.394 --> 35:06.854
I'm horrified that
this happened.

35:06.938 --> 35:08.147
I'm literally
fucking horrified.

35:08.231 --> 35:10.608
Cassie, you did not ask
for a home invasion.

35:10.691 --> 35:12.527
- Still. Still.
- Okay? Okay, upside,

35:12.610 --> 35:15.321
Max snapped
a photo of one of them.

35:16.239 --> 35:18.282
Wait, I know him.

35:18.366 --> 35:19.534
This guy was in Berlin.

35:19.617 --> 35:20.785
I saw him there,
but he was with a--

35:20.868 --> 35:22.203
he was with a woman.
He had different color hair.

35:22.286 --> 35:23.830
This was the couple?

35:23.913 --> 35:25.665
Wait, he was in Berlin?

35:25.748 --> 35:27.625
Yeah!

35:27.708 --> 35:30.294
Yeah, no, he also dyed
his hair blonde.

35:30.378 --> 35:31.712
So freaky
when couples look alike.

35:31.796 --> 35:33.923
- Oh, I hate it.
- Is every single human crazy

35:34.006 --> 35:35.258
and pretending
to be someone else?

35:35.341 --> 35:36.884
This is insane.

35:36.968 --> 35:38.052
It's okay.
Megan's in a safe place.

35:38.135 --> 35:40.221
I don't have to worry.
Go to Iceland, have fun.

35:40.304 --> 35:41.556
I'm sorry.
You know where she is?

35:41.639 --> 35:43.474
Hey, hey,
according to the news,

35:43.558 --> 35:44.475
the Echo Park Lake murders were

35:44.559 --> 35:45.768
right after that couple
left us,

35:45.852 --> 35:47.228
so they couldn't have crossed
town that fast.

35:47.311 --> 35:49.480
Okay. So then we agree
that the double

35:49.564 --> 35:51.190
probably committed
these murders, right?

35:51.274 --> 35:53.150
There's security cameras
placed all around that lake.

35:53.234 --> 35:56.153
Fuck, I mean, Cass,
that plus your

35:56.237 --> 35:57.780
hardware store purchases
and this,

35:57.864 --> 35:59.031
plus the fact
that you were in Berlin.

35:59.115 --> 36:00.241
I know. I know.

36:00.324 --> 36:02.034
And I know that you can explain
most of this away,

36:02.118 --> 36:04.579
but the tonnage is really
starting to add up.

36:04.662 --> 36:06.205
I have to go to the CIA
with this.

36:06.289 --> 36:07.623
I have to.
You guys, this is...

36:07.707 --> 36:08.958
It's too much, it's piling on,

36:09.041 --> 36:10.418
- I can't, I can't, I can't.
- Cass,

36:10.501 --> 36:12.587
they told you not to
look into it and you did.

36:12.670 --> 36:14.297
And not for nothing,

36:14.380 --> 36:15.923
you're gonna look suspicious
as fuck to them.

36:16.007 --> 36:18.217
I know that.
But this has gone too far.

36:18.301 --> 36:19.635
I have to go say something.

36:34.400 --> 36:36.485
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

36:36.569 --> 36:38.821
Sorry, I was looking for Dot
and I can't get ahold of her

36:38.905 --> 36:40.323
and I really need
to talk to someone.

36:40.406 --> 36:41.949
Now is not the time.

36:42.033 --> 36:43.451
No, no.
See, here's the thing, it is.

36:43.534 --> 36:45.661
This is very important.

36:45.745 --> 36:47.288
You know
I'm so tough with you

36:47.371 --> 36:50.041
because I'm trying
to protect you.

36:50.124 --> 36:52.543
'Cause this is--
this is dangerous,

36:52.627 --> 36:54.337
dangerous work, Bowden.

36:54.420 --> 36:56.547
Are--are you okay?

36:56.631 --> 36:58.925
No.

36:59.008 --> 37:02.303
I lost two analysts today.

37:02.386 --> 37:05.473
Murdered at Echo Park Lake.

37:05.556 --> 37:09.060
And we don't even have any idea
why they were there.

37:09.143 --> 37:10.728
Oh, my God.

37:10.811 --> 37:12.855
I'm so sorry. I--I--
I heard about that today.

37:12.939 --> 37:14.607
I had no idea
they were CIA, though.

37:14.690 --> 37:16.609
- I--I--
- That's it right there.

37:16.692 --> 37:20.279
This place
is a fucking disaster.

37:20.363 --> 37:24.492
Sometimes I want
to burn the whole shit down.

37:24.575 --> 37:27.828
You ever have that feeling?

37:27.912 --> 37:29.914
Go ahead. Go.

37:29.997 --> 37:33.250
I'm going to be fucking fine.

37:56.232 --> 37:57.692
The door's over there.

38:00.277 --> 38:01.862
I'm just so fucking tired.

38:01.946 --> 38:04.365
You can practically smell
the alcohol on his breath.

38:04.448 --> 38:07.702
Ugh, imagine how good
he would taste.

38:07.785 --> 38:09.036
Say no.

38:09.120 --> 38:11.956
You've been wanting to blow up
this fake happy life for days.

38:12.039 --> 38:13.666
Come on, blow it up.

38:13.749 --> 38:16.544
Say yes.

38:28.180 --> 38:29.140
A moth?

38:29.223 --> 38:31.267
I'm not really
a butterfly girl.

38:31.350 --> 38:33.352
You're not a moth
either, Cassie.

38:33.436 --> 38:34.895
You're the whole goddamn flame.

38:34.979 --> 38:36.647
It's just a fucking tattoo.
