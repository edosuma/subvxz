00:06.006 --> 00:07.674
(distorted, echoing ticking)

00:07.674 --> 00:11.386
NANCY:
Every one of us
lives with a clock.

00:11.386 --> 00:15.015
Most of the time
we don't hear it tick.

00:15.015 --> 00:17.267
But when the end is near,
because you

00:17.267 --> 00:18.727
and your friends
made a bad deal

00:18.727 --> 00:20.687
with a vengeful sea spirit,

00:20.687 --> 00:23.482
and she's coming to kill you

00:23.482 --> 00:26.276
in three days,
that ticking clock

00:26.276 --> 00:28.320
drowns out everything else.

00:30.656 --> 00:32.950
Here. Quaint carriage house,
furnished.

00:32.950 --> 00:34.576
You should look at this.

00:34.576 --> 00:38.372
Okay. So, Nancy's tracking
the only known Aglaeca survivor,

00:38.372 --> 00:39.873
and...

00:39.873 --> 00:41.458
what are we doing?

00:41.458 --> 00:43.043
We're doing this.

00:43.043 --> 00:44.670
First you were on my couch
and then Nancy's couch.

00:44.670 --> 00:46.004
It's time for a place
of your own.

00:46.004 --> 00:47.798
Three days, George.

00:47.798 --> 00:50.717
Three days to beat the Aglaeca
or die trying.

00:50.717 --> 00:52.678
Is finding me a rental
really a priority?

00:52.678 --> 00:54.221
It is to me, okay?

00:54.221 --> 00:55.973
This is my way
of telling the universe

00:55.973 --> 00:58.225
that in three days life moves on
and we're still gonna be here.

00:58.225 --> 01:00.477
I'm buying green bananas.
Don't try to tell me otherwise.

01:00.477 --> 01:01.937
NICK:
Oh, my God.

01:01.937 --> 01:04.481
BESS:
They're buying produce,

01:04.481 --> 01:06.358
and you're washing dishes.

01:06.358 --> 01:09.194
Near the death cooler
with the meat hooks.

01:09.194 --> 01:10.821
Great.

01:10.821 --> 01:13.073
Should you even be here?

01:13.073 --> 01:14.491
I tried staying home.

01:13.073 --> 01:14.491
(sighs)

01:14.491 --> 01:17.035
But my mom is out of town,
my dad and I just argue,

01:17.035 --> 01:18.245
so this feels a lot better.

01:18.245 --> 01:20.330
Okay, fine.
Um, since I have you,

01:20.330 --> 01:21.957
I have an idea.

01:21.957 --> 01:25.294
So, Lucy's bones is what
got us here in the first place,

01:25.294 --> 01:27.754
and-and I know
that Nancy wants

01:27.754 --> 01:29.631
to bury her
mum, but...

01:29.631 --> 01:32.551
what if we just give the bones
back to the Aglaeca?

01:32.551 --> 01:34.720
What are you saying,
we just throw the bones

01:34.720 --> 01:36.680
back into the sea, and the
Aglaeca calls off everything?

01:36.680 --> 01:37.889
Yeah.
Yeah, bingo.

01:37.889 --> 01:39.683
No more death sentence.

01:39.683 --> 01:41.852
Wait. Look. I...
I did some research,

01:41.852 --> 01:45.272
and I found dozens of
cases throughout time.

01:45.272 --> 01:47.441
Okay, the binding
tablets of Macedonia,

01:47.441 --> 01:48.942
the stones of
St. Anne's Well--

01:48.942 --> 01:50.694
it's all here.

01:50.694 --> 01:52.362
Like a curse reverse.

01:52.362 --> 01:53.572
Yeah.

01:53.572 --> 01:56.575
Okay, let's ask Hannah Gruen.

01:53.572 --> 01:56.575
Okay, good.

01:56.575 --> 01:58.910
But even if we want to do it,
we don't have all the bones.

01:58.910 --> 02:01.330
What?

01:58.910 --> 02:01.330
The day that

02:01.330 --> 02:02.789
we put Lucy's skeleton
back together,

02:02.789 --> 02:04.207
there was a piece missing.

02:04.207 --> 02:06.084
Yeah.
A piece of Lucy's skull.

02:06.084 --> 02:08.337
I-I... I found it,

02:08.337 --> 02:10.797
and I hid it
from Detective Tamura.

02:10.797 --> 02:12.799
I-I thought you took it.

02:13.800 --> 02:15.218
No.

02:15.218 --> 02:17.596
(sighs)

02:15.218 --> 02:17.596
So... none of us have it?

02:19.139 --> 02:21.099
What, Tamura found it?

02:19.139 --> 02:21.099
Yes!

02:21.099 --> 02:23.226
Of course Tamura
found it!

02:23.226 --> 02:24.895
Okay, he already
doesn't like us,

02:24.895 --> 02:27.898
and now-- now-- he's gonna
think we're grave robbers

02:27.898 --> 02:30.025
and-and bone smugglers...

02:30.025 --> 02:31.443
Let's try to live long enough

02:31.443 --> 02:33.028
for Tamura
to be our biggest problem.

02:33.028 --> 02:35.155
I'll get the bone.
You go talk to Hannah.

02:35.155 --> 02:37.407
Yes, okay.

02:42.746 --> 02:45.082
Welcome to Lily's.
Can I help you?

02:42.746 --> 02:45.082
Well, um...

02:45.082 --> 02:48.335
Oh, you're Lily. Ha.

02:48.335 --> 02:50.587
Great name for a florist.

02:48.335 --> 02:50.587
Yes.

02:50.587 --> 02:52.506
Almost like I had no choice.

02:50.587 --> 02:52.506
(chuckles)

02:52.506 --> 02:56.176
Um, I was visiting the grave of
a dear friend the other night,

02:56.176 --> 02:58.178
and I noticed that somebody left

02:58.178 --> 03:00.764
this beautiful wreath
of white roses.

03:00.764 --> 03:03.392
The groundskeeper told me that
it came from your shop.

03:03.392 --> 03:05.894
I would just really like
to issue a thank you.

03:05.894 --> 03:07.687
Um, if-if you could
give me their name

03:07.687 --> 03:08.814
or their phone number, maybe...

03:08.814 --> 03:11.983
Oh, no, that's legally
impossible.

03:11.983 --> 03:13.902
Legally?

03:13.902 --> 03:15.862
Is there some kind
of florist-client privilege

03:15.862 --> 03:17.447
I don't know about?

03:17.447 --> 03:20.492
Well, in here there is.
The answer's no.

03:20.492 --> 03:22.702
Was there anything else?

03:22.702 --> 03:25.455
No. I'm just gonna
look around.

03:39.845 --> 03:41.930
(phone rings)

03:41.930 --> 03:43.682
Lily's Garden,
can I help you?

03:43.682 --> 03:46.309
I'm getting married
this afternoon, 150 guests.

03:46.309 --> 03:48.728
My florist was just extradited.

03:48.728 --> 03:53.066
Can you help me?

03:48.728 --> 03:53.066
Oh, I would suggest
zinnias, dahlias

03:53.066 --> 03:55.318
and English daisies.
I'll go count.

03:55.318 --> 03:57.028
Oh, big day.
Big, big day.

04:08.623 --> 04:10.917
Come on, give me something.

04:10.917 --> 04:13.086
Bingo, a phone number.

04:15.338 --> 04:18.008
You have got to be kidding me.

Hi, you've reached
the law office of Carson Drew.

04:45.952 --> 04:47.746
GEORGE: Your dad Carson?

04:47.746 --> 04:51.500
Carson Drew sent the flowers
to the 1975 victims?

04:51.500 --> 04:54.294
Yep. And he's been doing it
every year for over a decade.

04:54.294 --> 04:56.046
How many secrets
can one guy have?

04:56.046 --> 04:57.631
What about AJ?

04:57.631 --> 04:59.466
There's no mention of AJ,

04:59.466 --> 05:01.134
just the note that
went along with the flowers:

05:01.134 --> 05:04.513
"Forgive me, Kitsune,"
and Carson Drew's phone number.

05:04.513 --> 05:06.014
So the only
connection we have

05:06.014 --> 05:07.891
to the sole survivor
of the Aglaeca...

05:07.891 --> 05:09.893
Is the one guy that I don't know

05:09.893 --> 05:11.311
if I can have
a conversation with

05:11.311 --> 05:13.396
without losing my mind.

05:13.396 --> 05:15.690
Yeah. So that's why I'm
meeting him in a public place,

05:15.690 --> 05:18.485
right here, and you guys...

05:18.485 --> 05:21.112
We're like the ambulance
on standby at the Indy 500.

get me out of there.

05:35.627 --> 05:37.712
How are you?

05:37.712 --> 05:39.839
Why do you send flowers
to the same five graves

05:39.839 --> 05:42.050
at Hillside Cemetery every year
on the same day?

05:42.050 --> 05:44.469
What?

05:42.050 --> 05:44.469
Five graves.

05:44.469 --> 05:47.097
Hillside Cemetery... every year.

05:47.097 --> 05:48.431
Do you know what
I'm talking about?

05:48.431 --> 05:51.393
Yes or no?

05:48.431 --> 05:51.393
Yes, but...

05:51.393 --> 05:54.479
that's what you want
to talk about?

05:54.479 --> 05:56.439
I was hoping that
maybe you were ready to...

05:56.439 --> 05:57.899
Oh, I don't know if I'll
ever be ready for that.

05:57.899 --> 05:59.901
The guy that sends the flowers'
name is AJ.

05:59.901 --> 06:02.279
Are you sending the flowers
for AJ, or are you AJ?

06:02.279 --> 06:04.823
AJ Nishiyama.

06:04.823 --> 06:07.158
He goes by AJ Crane.

06:07.158 --> 06:08.660
You've probably seen his books.

06:08.660 --> 06:11.496
AJ Crane, the horror novelist?

06:11.496 --> 06:13.540
I was his lawyer
years ago, briefly.

06:13.540 --> 06:15.500
I arranged
for that delivery.

06:15.500 --> 06:18.461
White roses every year
on Harbor Day.

06:18.461 --> 06:20.714
Why was his lawyer doing
his flower purchasing?

06:20.714 --> 06:24.676
Because AJ was a total recluse,
even back then.

06:24.676 --> 06:26.553
He bought an old hunting cabin
up in the woods,

06:26.553 --> 06:28.054
almost never left it.

06:28.054 --> 06:30.265
Refused to deal with
the outside world.

06:30.265 --> 06:33.018
Like Salinger?

06:30.265 --> 06:33.018
Or Kaczynski.

06:33.018 --> 06:36.813
I need his address.

06:33.018 --> 06:36.813
I won't give you his address.

06:36.813 --> 06:38.356
But I'll take you there.

06:38.356 --> 06:40.275
It's a two-hour drive.

06:40.275 --> 06:42.277

to keep talking.

I've read all of his books.
Did you meet him?

10:23.748 --> 10:26.167
Yes. Um, so he kept
looking at this

10:26.167 --> 10:28.169
like it was
a security blanket.

it could repel the Aglaeca?

Nothing we've done
so far makes any sense.

10:55.113 --> 10:56.281
Nothing is working,

10:56.281 --> 10:58.908
Nancy, and...

10:58.908 --> 11:01.160
everyone wants to try this.

11:02.412 --> 11:04.289
When were you all gonna tell me?

11:05.790 --> 11:07.834
I'm telling you now.

11:12.171 --> 11:14.757
(groans)

11:14.757 --> 11:16.801
Going to lunch.

11:16.801 --> 11:19.178
Joyce is in charge. No parties.

11:22.223 --> 11:24.809
Yo, Fred, you...

11:24.809 --> 11:26.561
You're not Fred.

11:26.561 --> 11:28.646
Where's Fred?

11:28.646 --> 11:31.900
The new detective
transferred him to traffic duty.

11:31.900 --> 11:33.818
Detective Tamura?

11:33.818 --> 11:35.570
Why would he do that?

11:35.570 --> 11:38.781
I mean, I'd ask the guy,
but he went to lunch.

11:38.781 --> 11:41.951
Said the evidence room
security was lax.

11:41.951 --> 11:44.579
Too many civilians
in and out.

11:44.579 --> 11:47.707
Well, that makes sense.

11:47.707 --> 11:50.543
I mean, what, with the
human skull that he found.

11:50.543 --> 11:54.088
You don't want a lot of people
just popping in to say "hello."

11:54.088 --> 11:55.632
What human skull?

12:11.356 --> 12:13.232
♪ ♪

12:38.007 --> 12:40.051
♪ ♪

12:49.143 --> 12:51.270
(indistinct chatter)

12:51.270 --> 12:53.564
Ooh, Dad. What are
you doing here?

12:58.194 --> 13:01.155
Again? What happened
to retirement?

13:01.155 --> 13:04.701
You never tell me when
you're coming in to work.

13:04.701 --> 13:07.036
I'm part of this family, too.

13:17.505 --> 13:20.216
Well, tonight I have plans
with my friends.

13:34.313 --> 13:37.817
Uh... I'll be there.

13:37.817 --> 13:39.777
I'll be there.
See you tonight at sundown.

13:40.778 --> 13:43.072
Okay? All right.

13:47.994 --> 13:49.620
Do you have a nice jacket?

13:49.620 --> 13:52.165
Landlords like to rent to
tenants who wear nice jackets.

13:52.165 --> 13:54.042
Yeah, yeah, it's just
under my top hat. George.

13:54.042 --> 13:55.877
Polo shirt.
See, this works.

13:55.877 --> 13:57.670
Look, listen,
before I go ask

13:57.670 --> 14:00.048
for a three-day lease
with an option for death...

14:00.048 --> 14:03.843
Okay, stop!
Just stop.

14:03.843 --> 14:06.304
It gets to me,
too, all right?

14:06.304 --> 14:08.556
Hey, okay.
It's okay.

14:08.556 --> 14:11.350
Look, I didn't come here
to pick out clothing with you.

14:11.350 --> 14:13.561
I came because, if we have less
than three days left,

14:13.561 --> 14:15.313
I don't want to be apart
for any of it.

14:15.313 --> 14:17.065
Me, neither.

14:17.065 --> 14:19.901
It's not fair--
you and me.

14:19.901 --> 14:21.235
I just... I keep thinking
about all the things

14:21.235 --> 14:24.614
we're gonna miss, like...

14:24.614 --> 14:27.033
(sighs)
We're never gonna
have a road trip,

14:27.033 --> 14:30.703
or an anniversary
for our first kiss.

14:30.703 --> 14:35.583
Or wake up in the same bed,
argue over who stole the covers.

14:42.006 --> 14:44.050
Or even get to bed
in the first place.

14:46.844 --> 14:49.305
I don't want
to miss everything, Nick.

14:56.062 --> 14:58.272
Mmm.

14:59.899 --> 15:01.317
(door closes)

15:04.153 --> 15:06.614
Oh, my.
Oh, my God. Nancy. I...

15:06.614 --> 15:08.574
NICK:
Oh, we were, we were
just, um, uh, uh...

15:08.574 --> 15:11.244
Look, I don't need details.

15:11.244 --> 15:13.955
We're so sorry, Nancy.

15:11.244 --> 15:13.955
Yeah, yeah.

15:13.955 --> 15:15.414
Uh, we're gonna go.

15:13.955 --> 15:15.414
We're gonna...

15:13.955 --> 15:15.414
Sorry.

15:15.414 --> 15:16.999
We're gonna go.

15:21.921 --> 15:23.673
(phone ringing)

15:23.673 --> 15:25.383
Hello?

15:25.383 --> 15:27.718
AJ:
Where's your daughter, Drew?

15:27.718 --> 15:29.554
AJ?

15:29.554 --> 15:31.180
That girl took something
of mine,

15:31.180 --> 15:33.141
and now hell is coming for her.

15:33.141 --> 15:35.184
AJ, what are you talking about?

15:36.686 --> 15:39.230
Hello? AJ!

15:51.159 --> 15:55.288
(wind whistling)

15:56.539 --> 15:57.790
(phone vibrating)

15:58.791 --> 16:00.918
Hello?

16:00.918 --> 16:02.628
Nancy, it's Hannah.

16:02.628 --> 16:04.213
Do you still have that talisman?

16:04.213 --> 16:05.798
Yeah, I'm looking right at it.

16:05.798 --> 16:07.717
Get rid of it.

16:07.717 --> 16:09.677
That pattern--

16:09.677 --> 16:11.679
it's the mark of the bhoot.

16:11.679 --> 16:13.723
Malevolent spirits
on the Indian subcontinent.

16:13.723 --> 16:15.183
What does that mean?

16:15.183 --> 16:17.185
It doesn't repel spirits.

16:17.185 --> 16:19.061
It attracts them.

16:19.061 --> 16:21.022
It's bait for the most vicious

16:21.022 --> 16:22.815
and dangerous ghosts
in the area.

16:22.815 --> 16:24.066
Nancy, you need to get...

16:24.066 --> 16:25.818
(line clicks)

16:24.066 --> 16:25.818
Hannah?

16:25.818 --> 16:27.778
Hannah?!

16:27.778 --> 16:29.572
(wind howling)

16:33.534 --> 16:35.328
(roaring)

16:38.789 --> 16:40.666
(shrieking)

16:43.127 --> 16:44.754
(shrieks)

16:44.754 --> 16:46.631
Don't look back!

16:46.631 --> 16:48.841
Get down! Stay there.

16:48.841 --> 16:51.552
Cover your ears! Do it!

16:51.552 --> 16:53.471
(yells)

16:53.471 --> 16:55.264
(wind howling)

16:53.471 --> 16:55.264
(AJ grunting)

16:58.768 --> 17:00.603
(glass shatters)

17:00.603 --> 17:02.521
(AJ continues grunting)

17:04.607 --> 17:06.484
(wind stops)

17:11.530 --> 17:13.366
My talisman.

17:11.530 --> 17:13.366
Are you okay?

17:13.366 --> 17:15.159
What was that?

17:13.366 --> 17:15.159
Where-Where's my talisman?

17:15.159 --> 17:16.369
(door opens)

17:15.159 --> 17:16.369
TAMURA:
Police!

17:16.369 --> 17:18.579
AJ Crane, put your hands up.

17:18.579 --> 17:21.707
What? No. Wait, wait.
What are you doing?

17:21.707 --> 17:23.584
Your father asked me
to check the house.

17:23.584 --> 17:25.962
My father?

17:23.584 --> 17:25.962
You're under arrest

17:25.962 --> 17:27.672
for breaking and entering.

17:27.672 --> 17:29.382
You have the right
to remain silent.

17:29.382 --> 17:32.510
Anything you say...

17:29.382 --> 17:32.510
No! He didn't do anything!

17:32.510 --> 17:33.970
I need to talk to him.

17:42.937 --> 17:44.522
A Hudson getting
his own groceries.

17:44.522 --> 17:47.024
What is it,
a full moon or something?

17:47.024 --> 17:48.734
They're for Patrice Dodd.

17:48.734 --> 17:51.279
That's unexpected.

17:51.279 --> 17:54.907
You're, uh, getting groceries
for Lucy's mom now?

17:54.907 --> 17:58.077
Yeah, well, she's all alone,
so I started visiting her.

17:58.077 --> 18:01.455
I figured it was a...
a way to honor Lucy.

18:01.455 --> 18:03.749
Is that supposed
to make me feel better about

18:03.749 --> 18:05.126
being your daughter?

18:05.126 --> 18:06.836
I don't know. Does it?

18:06.836 --> 18:11.382
(scoffs)
Forget it. I... need a favor.

18:11.382 --> 18:13.634
See, that right there-- that's
the opposite of unexpected.

18:13.634 --> 18:16.345
I know, but think about
all the times I didn't ask you

18:16.345 --> 18:18.514
for money or braces
or dance lessons

18:18.514 --> 18:21.767
or keys to the Porsche.

18:18.514 --> 18:21.767
Okay, Nancy.

18:18.514 --> 18:21.767
What's the favor?

18:21.767 --> 18:24.478
I know that Horseshoe Bay P.D.
is under new management,

18:24.478 --> 18:26.689
but does the Hudson name
still have juice there?

18:42.079 --> 18:45.499
Hey! I want to see a lawyer!

18:47.710 --> 18:49.795
(sighs)

18:49.795 --> 18:52.798
(eerie breathing echoes)

18:55.217 --> 18:57.428
(gasps)

18:57.428 --> 18:59.263
(shrieking)

18:59.263 --> 19:02.224
Mr. Crane?

19:02.224 --> 19:03.642
(shuddering)

19:03.642 --> 19:05.061
(gasps)

19:07.980 --> 19:09.565
You brought it?

19:07.980 --> 19:09.565
Yeah.

19:09.565 --> 19:12.151
I, um...

19:12.151 --> 19:13.736
I'm really sorry
that I took it.

19:13.736 --> 19:16.489
I... I didn't know
what else to do.

19:22.536 --> 19:25.831
Can you tell me how
it works? Please?

19:30.002 --> 19:34.131
Yeah, Shabbat.
It's a whole thing with my dad.

19:34.131 --> 19:36.258
He converted
when he married my mom.

19:36.258 --> 19:38.135
Bess, don't worry.

19:38.135 --> 19:41.013
I will be at the shoreline
in time for low tide.

19:43.891 --> 19:46.227
I got to go. Bye.

19:51.816 --> 19:53.109
Mom come back early?

19:57.029 --> 19:58.697
Ace.

19:58.697 --> 20:00.658
Heard I missed you
at the station today.

20:00.658 --> 20:02.701
Thanks for welcoming me
into your home.

20:06.664 --> 20:09.291
You look surprised.

20:06.664 --> 20:09.291
No.

20:09.291 --> 20:11.460
This is... this is
my Shabbat face.

20:11.460 --> 20:13.295
TAMURA:
Ah.

20:13.295 --> 20:15.423
How did all this come about?

20:15.423 --> 20:19.135
"Ran into Detective Tamura
after lunch.

20:19.135 --> 20:22.555
Told him about our Shabbat
dinner, and he said..."

20:22.555 --> 20:24.056
The hardest part about moving
to a new town is having no one

20:24.056 --> 20:25.558
to celebrate Shabbat with.

20:25.558 --> 20:27.518
Well...

20:28.727 --> 20:31.272
(clears throat)

20:31.272 --> 20:34.608
It's amazing. Uh...

20:34.608 --> 20:37.111
The same day that I visited
the police station,

20:37.111 --> 20:40.364
you got yourself invited
to dinner here.

20:40.364 --> 20:43.242
It is amazing,
no bones about it.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.627
I didn't know
that you were Jewish.

20:53.627 --> 20:55.004
Half-Jewish.

20:59.300 --> 21:02.636
Here's a thought. Why...
Why don't we let our guest

21:02.636 --> 21:04.472
say the Motzi?

21:04.472 --> 21:08.559
"We don't need to put Abe
on the spot like that."

21:08.559 --> 21:12.730
Actually, I'm-I'm happy
to take a stab at it.

21:12.730 --> 21:15.316
See if I can remember
all the words.

21:20.613 --> 21:22.823
Baruch ata, Adonai Eloheinu,

21:22.823 --> 21:24.366
melech ha'olam,

21:24.366 --> 21:26.577
hamotzi lechem
min ha'aretz.

21:28.954 --> 21:30.706
I could sing it, too,
if you guys...

21:30.706 --> 21:32.374
Oh, that's okay.
He can't hear.

21:32.374 --> 21:33.876
You look hungry.
We should just...

21:33.876 --> 21:36.462
go right into it.

21:36.462 --> 21:38.881
There were six of us
in the car.

21:38.881 --> 21:42.176
Six... stupid teenagers.

21:42.176 --> 21:43.802
Mac was driving
too fast,

21:43.802 --> 21:46.055
trying to scare Rita.

21:46.055 --> 21:47.264
We skidded through a red light,

21:47.264 --> 21:48.891
slammed into a station wagon,

21:48.891 --> 21:50.893
and it burst into flame.

21:52.353 --> 21:53.896
Did you...

21:53.896 --> 21:55.981
God protects idiots.

21:57.983 --> 22:00.152
The other driver and...
(shudders)

22:00.152 --> 22:03.614
his wife were both killed.

22:03.614 --> 22:06.825
They pulled a three-year-old
girl out of the wreckage.

22:06.825 --> 22:09.370
She wasn't expected
to survive the night.

22:11.038 --> 22:12.456
It was our fault.

22:12.456 --> 22:14.208
We had to do something.

22:14.208 --> 22:15.834
So you called
to the Aglaeca.

22:15.834 --> 22:19.088
We asked to make sure
the little girl lived.

22:19.088 --> 22:22.049
Mm. We couldn't pay the toll.

22:22.049 --> 22:24.510
Yeah, just like us.

22:26.262 --> 22:28.222
The little girl...

22:28.222 --> 22:29.223
After she got out
of the burn unit,

22:29.223 --> 22:32.017
she was adopted by a couple

22:32.017 --> 22:33.769
that ran the historical society.

22:33.769 --> 22:35.104
Oh, my God.

22:37.064 --> 22:40.401
The scars on her arms are burns.

22:40.401 --> 22:43.821
The-the little girl
was Hannah Gruen?

22:43.821 --> 22:47.199
The Aglaeca always keeps
her end of the bargain.

22:47.199 --> 22:50.077
Seven days later,

22:50.077 --> 22:51.537
my five friends were dead.

22:51.537 --> 22:53.747
But you're not.

22:53.747 --> 22:55.624
How is that?
How'd you do it?

22:55.624 --> 22:57.543
My friends stayed put.
I hit the road.

22:57.543 --> 22:59.461
But you can't outrun
the Aglaeca.

22:59.461 --> 23:01.630
She'll find you,
wherever you are.

23:01.630 --> 23:02.423
So...

23:04.008 --> 23:05.759
...I started looking
for anything

23:05.759 --> 23:07.136
that would keep
a monster at bay.

23:07.136 --> 23:10.097
And I found it,

23:10.097 --> 23:12.891
in a pawn shop in New Orleans.

23:12.891 --> 23:14.727
It's like a magnet.

23:14.727 --> 23:17.521
It draws the most malevolent
spirits around to you,

23:17.521 --> 23:19.773
so the Aglaeca stays away.

23:19.773 --> 23:21.817
How do you keep a man-eating
tiger out of your tent?

23:21.817 --> 23:24.194
Make sure to keep yourself
covered with the most

23:24.194 --> 23:25.738
poisonous spiders you can find.

23:25.738 --> 23:27.072
(shudders)

23:27.072 --> 23:28.616
And if you're an orphan

23:28.616 --> 23:32.870
and your will to survive
far outweighs everything else,

23:32.870 --> 23:34.913
you endure the pain.

23:34.913 --> 23:36.999
They come in waves.

23:36.999 --> 23:39.209
Every single day
for 44 years.

23:39.209 --> 23:40.836
And there's no other way out?

23:40.836 --> 23:42.755
I've looked.

23:42.755 --> 23:45.090
If there's another way out,
I haven't found it.

23:46.300 --> 23:48.886
(wind whistling)

23:48.886 --> 23:50.137
They're coming.

23:50.137 --> 23:51.889
You should go.

23:50.137 --> 23:51.889
Wait.

23:51.889 --> 23:54.808
Um, my-my friend Bess, she-she
came up with this theory.

23:54.808 --> 23:57.686
W-What if we give back
what we asked the Aglaeca for?

23:57.686 --> 23:59.188
I asked for a little girl
to live.

23:59.188 --> 24:01.273
That option isn't
available to me anymore.

24:01.273 --> 24:02.733
Y-Yeah, but-but...
but what about us?

24:02.733 --> 24:04.693
Try anything.
Just don't end up like me.

24:04.693 --> 24:06.028
Now go.

24:06.028 --> 24:06.987
Are you gonna be all right?

24:06.987 --> 24:08.238
Get the hell out!

24:08.238 --> 24:10.616
(wind screeching)

24:08.238 --> 24:10.616
Go! Go!

24:10.616 --> 24:12.159
(Nancy panting)

24:12.159 --> 24:14.745
Bess? I'm in.

24:14.745 --> 24:16.997
Let's give that bitch
the bones back.

24:24.838 --> 24:27.591
Oh. Uh...

24:24.838 --> 24:27.591
(clattering)

24:30.135 --> 24:34.264
Um, this is all they had.

24:34.264 --> 24:36.058
(laughs softly)

24:36.058 --> 24:38.060
I mean, I-I wanted it
to have a view.

24:38.060 --> 24:39.978
Or, um, or, um...
(clears throat)

24:39.978 --> 24:41.563
less colorful sheets.

24:41.563 --> 24:43.774
Or maybe the...

24:43.774 --> 24:45.734
Nick.
(laughs softly)

24:45.734 --> 24:48.028
It's perfect.

Yeah.

Me, too.

While your dad's
in the kitchen,

26:42.851 --> 26:43.811
is there something you
want to say to me?

26:45.854 --> 26:48.148
Well, you knocked it out
of the park with that Hebrew.

26:49.900 --> 26:51.527
Did you pick it up today?
YouTube?

26:51.527 --> 26:53.737
My bar mitzvah. Temple Sinai.

26:53.737 --> 26:55.948
(sighs)

26:55.948 --> 26:58.367
You know why I'm here.

26:58.367 --> 27:00.327
You took something
from my office today.

27:00.327 --> 27:01.912
I don't even know
where your office is.

27:01.912 --> 27:04.081
Try again.

27:04.081 --> 27:05.624
Detective, I don't know
what you're talking about.

27:05.624 --> 27:07.209
Did you misplace something?

27:07.209 --> 27:09.837
Listen to me,
you walking haircut...

27:09.837 --> 27:11.171
What's going on?

27:14.550 --> 27:17.177
I found a human skull
bone in The Claw,

27:17.177 --> 27:19.721
and this afternoon that bone
went missing from my office.

27:22.057 --> 27:25.894
You found a human bone
at The Claw?

27:25.894 --> 27:28.397
Okay, Brando, dial it down.

27:28.397 --> 27:31.316
And why was a human bone
in your office,

27:31.316 --> 27:32.609
and not the evidence room?

27:31.316 --> 27:32.609
Enough.

27:32.609 --> 27:34.611
I'm gonna search you, search
your room until I find it.

27:34.611 --> 27:36.196
All right?

27:36.196 --> 27:38.073
"Not without
a warrant."

27:40.284 --> 27:42.411
He says
this is his house

27:42.411 --> 27:43.829
and his son,
whom he trusts, so...

27:43.829 --> 27:48.125
if you want to search,
go see a judge.

27:57.342 --> 27:58.385
Thanks for dinner.

28:00.971 --> 28:02.556
Ace?

28:04.766 --> 28:07.728
We'll talk.

28:07.728 --> 28:09.146
Shabbat shalom.

28:13.901 --> 28:14.693
(door closes)

28:18.071 --> 28:21.199
I didn't do anything wrong,
but it's pretty deep.

28:23.619 --> 28:25.037
You can't.

28:27.331 --> 28:31.627
My friends and I, we-we think
that we're gonna fix it tonight,

28:31.627 --> 28:34.129
but that means that I have
to go, like, right now.

28:41.261 --> 28:43.680
(quietly):
Thank you.

28:43.680 --> 28:45.474
(exhales)

29:05.744 --> 29:10.332
Lucy, I'm sorry that I couldn't
give you a better burial.

29:11.625 --> 29:13.418
Hey.
(sniffles)

29:13.418 --> 29:16.380
She's saving your life.
(chuckles)

29:16.380 --> 29:18.173
It's what she
would've wanted.

29:23.387 --> 29:26.139
(both exhale)

29:26.139 --> 29:29.184
Aglaeca,

29:29.184 --> 29:31.269
guardian of the mighty sea...

29:31.269 --> 29:34.356
You hateful, vindictive,
sex-life stealing,

29:34.356 --> 29:36.942
mortality-sucking...

29:34.356 --> 29:36.942
Hey, shush!

29:36.942 --> 29:38.652
(shushes)

29:40.112 --> 29:43.240
We humbly ask that
you forgive our debt.

29:43.240 --> 29:45.200
In return, we offer you

29:45.200 --> 29:48.161
the bones of Lucy Sable.

29:48.161 --> 29:50.580
What once was yours
is yours again.

29:56.920 --> 29:59.131
What more does she want?

29:59.131 --> 30:01.591
We know what she wants.

30:05.429 --> 30:07.097
(winces)

30:12.144 --> 30:16.231
Aglaeca, forgive our debt.

30:16.231 --> 30:19.026
What we requested,
we've returned.

30:31.455 --> 30:34.583
BESS:
She took the bones back.

30:34.583 --> 30:37.169
That one really likes her blood.

30:34.583 --> 30:37.169
(phone vibrating)

30:38.628 --> 30:40.172
HBPD.

30:40.172 --> 30:42.132
If that's Tamura,
I'm not here.

30:42.132 --> 30:43.759
Hello?

30:43.759 --> 30:45.260
TAMURA:
Where's AJ Crane?

30:45.260 --> 30:46.887
30 minutes after you left,
he escaped.

30:46.887 --> 30:47.846
You're gonna tell me you don't
know how that happened?

30:47.846 --> 30:49.973
I don't know how that happened.

30:49.973 --> 30:50.974
BESS:
Wait, I do.

30:50.974 --> 30:52.768
I do.

30:52.768 --> 30:55.270
Okay, so in one of his books,
The Cold Cell,

30:55.270 --> 30:58.273
the guy spends three years
researching the company

30:58.273 --> 30:59.608
who manufactures
the prison's bars,

30:59.608 --> 31:00.942
doors and hinges.

31:00.942 --> 31:02.152
It's in the hinges.

31:02.152 --> 31:03.528
Check the hinges!

31:03.528 --> 31:04.821
We just had a sighting
on Chestnut Street.

31:04.821 --> 31:06.490
He's headed east.

31:04.821 --> 31:06.490
Set up a roadblock.

31:04.821 --> 31:06.490
Then...

31:06.490 --> 31:08.742
check the hinges.

31:08.742 --> 31:10.619
You and your friends,
we're gonna have

31:10.619 --> 31:13.538
a real come-to-Jesus
when this is over.

31:14.790 --> 31:15.999
ACE:
"Come to Jesus"?

31:15.999 --> 31:18.668
The man had a bar mitzvah.
Pick a lane.

31:18.668 --> 31:20.295
Nancy, what's wrong?

31:20.295 --> 31:23.131
AJ was spotted
on Chestnut Street.

31:23.131 --> 31:25.217
Hey, that's
the historical society.

31:25.217 --> 31:26.301
Yeah, what if we're not
the only ones trying

31:26.301 --> 31:28.970
to return something
to the Aglaeca tonight?

31:28.970 --> 31:30.347
Well, what did AJ ask for?

31:32.349 --> 31:34.142
Hannah Gruen's life.

31:41.858 --> 31:44.069
(line ringing)

31:44.069 --> 31:46.154
NICK (over phone): Ace and Bess
are checking the attic.

31:46.154 --> 31:47.531
No sign of Hannah yet.

31:47.531 --> 31:49.449
Okay, I'll try her phone again.

31:49.449 --> 31:51.034
(phone vibrating nearby)

32:13.056 --> 32:15.350
Oh, my God.

32:15.350 --> 32:18.061
AJ?

32:18.061 --> 32:19.604
AJ, stop.

32:19.604 --> 32:21.189
Is this the plan?

32:21.189 --> 32:24.317
Hannah dies in a car fire,
like she was supposed to,

32:24.317 --> 32:26.236
you give her back
to the Aglaeca?

32:26.236 --> 32:30.198
For 44 years I let the worst
kind of monsters destroy me

32:30.198 --> 32:33.743
every single day.
I'm through.

32:33.743 --> 32:35.537
You think that
this ends your suffering?

32:35.537 --> 32:38.790
Because it doesn't.
I-I think it'll be worse.

32:38.790 --> 32:41.543
You can't avoid the monster
when it's you.

32:44.087 --> 32:47.132
You are not a monster.

32:47.132 --> 32:49.009
You are a survivor.

32:51.386 --> 32:53.722
So give me the matches.

32:53.722 --> 32:55.515
Give me the matches.

33:03.773 --> 33:06.484
Nancy!

33:03.773 --> 33:06.484
Oh, my God.

33:06.484 --> 33:09.070
Uh, Hannah's in the car.
Call 911.

33:09.070 --> 33:11.281
Oh, my God, AJ Crane, I...
I have read all of your books...

33:11.281 --> 33:13.408
Bess, not now.

33:15.785 --> 33:18.163
GEORGE:
Hey, she's breathing.

33:18.163 --> 33:19.998
NICK:
Hello? Uh, yeah, yeah.

33:19.998 --> 33:22.667
Uh, we need, we need assistance.
We're at the, uh...

33:22.667 --> 33:23.960
Hey, Nancy.

33:23.960 --> 33:26.963
NANCY:
Let him go.

33:30.467 --> 33:32.969
Is that his?

33:32.969 --> 33:36.514
NANCY:
AJ, wait. Hey.

33:36.514 --> 33:38.600
You're not gonna
get very far.

33:38.600 --> 33:41.311
AJ:
I left it for you.

33:41.311 --> 33:44.272
The Aglaeca's out there
waiting. You're unprotected.

33:44.272 --> 33:47.317
Turns out I was
never protected.

33:47.317 --> 33:50.237
All those years alone
with your demons,

33:50.237 --> 33:52.489
it's... it's just
another way of being dead.

33:55.659 --> 33:59.120
The Aglaeca can have
whatever's left of me.

34:07.671 --> 34:09.297
NICK:
What are we doing here?

34:09.297 --> 34:11.341
Yeah, are any of us
gonna wish that

34:11.341 --> 34:13.134
we spent one more
night at work?

34:13.134 --> 34:15.262
We're celebrating.

34:15.262 --> 34:17.472
What, you think
the curse reverse worked?

34:17.472 --> 34:19.140
Called off the Aglaeca?

34:19.140 --> 34:22.727
I don't know. Maybe.
Maybe not.

34:22.727 --> 34:25.730
But what I do know is that
no matter what happens tomorrow

34:25.730 --> 34:28.316
or the next day,

34:28.316 --> 34:30.527
the five of us
were here today.

34:30.527 --> 34:32.946
Yeah, we are.

34:32.946 --> 34:34.698
Desserts all around.

34:34.698 --> 34:37.242
Yeah, I like that.
And for the record,

34:37.242 --> 34:41.079
yes, I do think the curse
has been reversed.

34:41.079 --> 34:43.373
(bell jingles)

34:43.373 --> 34:45.333
BESS:
Oh, no.

34:45.333 --> 34:47.168
It's Lucy's bones.

34:47.168 --> 34:50.672
No return policy.

34:50.672 --> 34:53.091
I hate this store.

35:04.894 --> 35:06.730
Hey, um...

35:06.730 --> 35:09.607
I'm sorry I
steamrolled you

35:09.607 --> 35:11.443
into using your
mother's remains

35:11.443 --> 35:13.653
as some kind of offering.

35:13.653 --> 35:16.364
That's okay.
At least we got 'em back.

35:16.364 --> 35:18.158
(phone chimes)

35:16.364 --> 35:18.158
And we're not giving up,

35:16.364 --> 35:18.158
there's...

35:18.158 --> 35:19.367
ACE:
Hey, guys, check your phones.

35:21.745 --> 35:24.539
National News Alert.

35:24.539 --> 35:27.417
"Renowned horror author
dies in freak accident."

35:27.417 --> 35:30.420
Oh, my God.

35:27.417 --> 35:30.420
"Writer AJ Crane
was killed Friday

35:30.420 --> 35:32.756
"when an errant weather vane
fell from a rooftop

35:32.756 --> 35:35.842
and impaled him in front
of horrified residents."

35:35.842 --> 35:38.386
"Grieving fans are claiming
he predicted his own death

35:40.263 --> 35:42.223
"He Died Alone."

35:42.223 --> 35:44.642
BESS: Hey, I-I've
read that one.

35:46.519 --> 35:51.149
Yeah, it's... it's the scariest
book he's ever written.

35:59.032 --> 36:01.201
Two more nights.

36:01.201 --> 36:03.411
That's it.

36:03.411 --> 36:05.372
Don't think about it.

36:07.874 --> 36:09.709
I'll walk you home.

36:12.545 --> 36:15.090
Nick...

36:15.090 --> 36:17.759
let's get in the truck.

36:17.759 --> 36:19.677
(scoffs)
No.

36:19.677 --> 36:22.430
The day after tomorrow,
we die in that truck.

36:22.430 --> 36:25.600
Okay, and you know what?
I don't care anymore.

36:25.600 --> 36:27.394
We're still here,
and the Aglaeca doesn't get

36:27.394 --> 36:28.645
to ruin everything.

36:28.645 --> 36:30.438
I'm tired of being afraid.

36:39.239 --> 36:42.117
We're reclaiming your truck.

36:42.117 --> 36:44.160

Hey, what is that?

40:22.670 --> 40:24.839
I think he was trying

40:24.839 --> 40:28.718
Um, follow-up question:
what is a dybbuk box?

40:28.718 --> 40:30.637
Uh, in Jewish folklore,
the dybbuk's an evil spirit.

40:30.637 --> 40:33.181
Just like the Aglaeca.
And you use this to trap it.

40:33.181 --> 40:34.974
And it looks like
he never finished it.

40:34.974 --> 40:37.435
So he never got the chance
to try it.

40:37.435 --> 40:39.812
So there we go.
We-we finish the box,

40:39.812 --> 40:41.481
