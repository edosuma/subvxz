00:00.112 --> 00:01.913
Previously on
"The Secret Circle"...

00:01.915 --> 00:04.799
My sweet Cassie,
you finding this means I'm gone,

00:04.800 --> 00:06.420
and for that,
I am so sorry.

00:06.464 --> 00:08.297
I didn't want you
to have this life,

00:08.299 --> 00:10.099
but destiny's not
easy to run from.

00:10.101 --> 00:13.452
You're a witch.
You're a full-blooded 100% witch.

00:13.454 --> 00:14.937
A complete circle is six.

00:14.939 --> 00:16.321
You complete the circle.

00:16.323 --> 00:17.606
That's the fire that
killed our parents.

00:17.608 --> 00:19.558
We need to know what
happened 16 years ago.

00:19.560 --> 00:20.675
That's when my mom died.

00:20.677 --> 00:21.860
And my dad.

00:21.862 --> 00:24.096
Francis Balcoin was as evil
as they come.

00:24.098 --> 00:27.232
He passed his dark power from
my father to me.

00:27.234 --> 00:28.534
We can all figure
this out together.

00:28.536 --> 00:29.684
Don't!

00:29.686 --> 00:31.653
Whatever this is,
I don't want it inside me.

00:31.655 --> 00:33.138
That fire
that he died in,

00:33.140 --> 00:35.124
did he have anything
to do with that?

00:35.126 --> 00:36.825
This is not a road
you want to go down.

00:36.827 --> 00:38.710
What if I'm just like him.

00:38.712 --> 00:40.078
Jake said understanding
where it comes from

00:40.080 --> 00:41.713
is what can help you
control it.

00:41.715 --> 00:44.133
Jake was a witch hunter
who chose to leave with them.

00:44.135 --> 00:46.868
You're now open
to receiving Cassie's energy.

00:48.539 --> 00:50.272
Faster, people.
It didn't work.

00:50.274 --> 00:51.473
I got your magic,
didn't I?

00:51.475 --> 00:53.509
The circle's magic,
not Cassie's.

00:55.000 --> 01:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:05.438 --> 01:06.939
Interrupting something?

01:06.941 --> 01:08.941
What the hell are
you doing here?

01:08.943 --> 01:11.093
Keeping an eye on Cassie.

01:13.947 --> 01:15.781
You were at the school.

01:15.783 --> 01:18.500
You're the one who saved me
and Melissa from the fire.

01:18.502 --> 01:21.370
So you're an
avenging angel now.

01:21.372 --> 01:23.789
Don't they usually
stay hidden in the shadows?

01:23.791 --> 01:25.574
Don't you usually have
a different girlfriend?

01:25.576 --> 01:26.675
What happened?

01:26.677 --> 01:28.594
Why did you leave
with the witch hunters?

01:28.596 --> 01:29.812
Where have you been?

01:29.814 --> 01:33.365
I had to get them as far away
from you as possible

01:33.367 --> 01:35.200
before I could escape.

01:35.202 --> 01:37.970
Part two of your plan is just
to lead them right to her?

01:37.972 --> 01:40.472
I came back to warn you.
About what?

01:40.474 --> 01:42.185
Discovering you were
a Balcoin stopped

01:42.210 --> 01:43.410
Isaac from killing you.

01:43.727 --> 01:47.045
Your bloodline's too strong
for him to mess with.

01:47.047 --> 01:48.814
He didn't want to
get torched like Luke.

01:48.816 --> 01:50.365
So then I'm safe.

01:50.367 --> 01:51.917
From Isaac.

01:51.919 --> 01:53.535
But not from the council.

01:53.537 --> 01:55.320
There's a council
of witch hunters?

01:55.322 --> 01:56.538
You their mascot?

01:56.540 --> 01:57.823
They have a ritual
that they use

01:57.825 --> 02:01.043
to kill witches
with dark power.

02:01.045 --> 02:05.747
The last time they used it
was 16 years ago.

02:05.749 --> 02:08.116
To kill your father.

02:09.785 --> 02:12.404
It's how they plan
on killing you.

02:28.137 --> 02:32.107
I thought my father was killed
in the fire with everyone else.

02:32.109 --> 02:34.576
And that happened because
the circle wasn't bound

02:34.578 --> 02:36.144
and their magic
got out of control.

02:36.146 --> 02:38.163
That's what we pieced
together from Diana's book.

02:38.165 --> 02:39.615
I thought
the same thing.

02:39.617 --> 02:41.216
I had no idea that
the witch hunters

02:41.218 --> 02:43.702
were at the boat yard that day,
but they were.

02:43.704 --> 02:45.571
So witch hunters
killed my father?

02:45.573 --> 02:46.905
Yes.

02:46.907 --> 02:48.340
Did they kill
all our parents?

02:48.342 --> 02:50.092
I only know
about Blackwell.

02:50.094 --> 02:53.845
One of the men in the council,
Eben, was there that day.

02:53.847 --> 02:57.683
He was talking about the ritual
they used to kill your father

02:57.685 --> 02:59.935
and destroy his dark magic.

02:59.937 --> 03:01.103
What was the ritual?

03:01.105 --> 03:03.455
He wouldn't tell me.

03:03.457 --> 03:05.207
Isaac didn't even know.

03:06.442 --> 03:08.310
But finding out is
the only way to protect you.

03:08.312 --> 03:10.312
You buying this?

03:10.314 --> 03:12.114
Adam, he saved
my life before.

03:12.116 --> 03:13.865
Or he just didn't know how
to kill you last time

03:13.867 --> 03:15.350
without the proper
ritual,

03:15.352 --> 03:18.687
and now he's come
back to find out.

03:18.689 --> 03:20.956
That's ridiculous.

03:20.958 --> 03:24.192
You stay away
from Cassie.

03:29.215 --> 03:30.865
You know
where to find me.

03:47.267 --> 03:48.350
You ok?

03:48.352 --> 03:51.870
Heh. I have no idea.

03:51.872 --> 03:53.355
You want to talk
about it?

03:53.357 --> 03:59.027
Which it? Jake?
The witch hunters?

03:59.029 --> 04:00.696
My father?

04:00.698 --> 04:03.865
I don't know.
Ladies choice.

04:03.867 --> 04:05.234
If Jake's right,

04:06.181 --> 04:08.281
then I have to find out
what happened to my father.

04:08.339 --> 04:10.038
I mean, I really have to.

04:10.040 --> 04:11.790
How do you trust him?

04:11.792 --> 04:16.411
I don't--I can't explain it.
I just do.

04:18.079 --> 04:20.515
I don't get why he's so obsessed
with your dark magic.

04:20.517 --> 04:22.384
He's just trying to
help me understand it.

04:22.386 --> 04:23.685
Why?

04:23.687 --> 04:26.688
Because he cares about me.

04:27.724 --> 04:30.258
You or your powers?

04:33.446 --> 04:36.448
He uses people.
That's all I'm saying.

04:36.450 --> 04:37.783
That's who he is.

04:37.785 --> 04:39.284
You don't really know him.

04:39.286 --> 04:40.719
But you do.

04:42.655 --> 04:45.907
Hey. I texted you both
like a hundred times.

04:45.909 --> 04:48.360
Is everything ok?
I was worried.

04:48.362 --> 04:50.779
Not worried
you were together,

04:50.781 --> 04:52.314
worried you were ok.

04:52.316 --> 04:55.500
We're fine.
I mean, sort of.

04:55.502 --> 04:58.003
I'll fill you in.

05:17.940 --> 05:19.808
Sweetheart, what are
you doing here?

05:19.810 --> 05:21.193
Dawn asked me to coffee.

05:21.195 --> 05:24.279
To catch up on a little
girl talk and gossip.

05:24.281 --> 05:27.332
I've got to run, so why don't you
take my seat?

05:27.334 --> 05:28.583
No, I can't. I'm--

05:28.585 --> 05:31.586
Dad, sit. Relax.

05:33.623 --> 05:35.674
Thanks again
for coffee.

05:35.676 --> 05:36.842
This was awesome.

05:36.844 --> 05:38.427
We'll do it again.

05:45.668 --> 05:48.353
Don't ever use my
daughter to get to me.

05:48.355 --> 05:50.105
What do you expect me
to do, Charles?

05:50.107 --> 05:51.523
You don't answer
my phone calls.

05:51.525 --> 05:53.558
Well, I thought I made it clear
I don't want to talk to you.

05:53.560 --> 05:55.227
Why, because your mother
doesn't like me?

05:55.229 --> 05:57.446
Maybe because
you wanted to kill her.

05:59.398 --> 06:04.836
Look, I admit,
things got a little crazy.

06:04.838 --> 06:08.006
But we have two crystals.

06:08.008 --> 06:09.691
The circle is bound.

06:09.693 --> 06:11.543
We are on our way
to getting our power back.

06:11.545 --> 06:16.331
No, Dawn, you have a dead one
and I have an alive one,

06:16.333 --> 06:17.999
and you're never getting
anywhere near it.

06:19.201 --> 06:22.220
Why are you doing
this to me, Charles?

06:23.756 --> 06:26.057
You're up to something

06:26.059 --> 06:27.759
and I'm gonna
find out what.

06:32.381 --> 06:34.883
After what happened
last night,

06:34.885 --> 06:37.435
you trying to siphon
magic from the circle,

06:37.437 --> 06:39.104
I don't know
why I'm here.

06:39.106 --> 06:43.158
Because your circle
skanks don't want you back.

06:43.160 --> 06:45.894
Because there are other ways
to get your magic back.

06:45.896 --> 06:47.529
So you keep saying.

06:53.753 --> 06:55.036
Hey, Lee.

06:55.038 --> 06:57.539
I didn't know you were
with a client.

06:57.541 --> 06:59.457
Please.
I'm not a client.

07:00.960 --> 07:03.745
A friend?

07:03.747 --> 07:05.313
Introduce me.

07:09.352 --> 07:12.587
Faye,
this is Callum.

07:12.589 --> 07:14.088
What do you want?

07:14.090 --> 07:17.592
Faye. Beautiful name.

07:17.594 --> 07:19.528
I'm surprised he even
remembers mine.

07:19.530 --> 07:21.112
Bitch won't return
my calls.

07:21.114 --> 07:22.314
I've been busy.

07:22.316 --> 07:24.366
Oh, yeah,
I can see that.

07:24.368 --> 07:26.034
Excuse us, honey.
Shop talk.

07:26.036 --> 07:27.202
Get us some beers
from the house.

07:27.204 --> 07:28.537
Do I look like
a waitress?

07:28.539 --> 07:30.405
Get it yourself.

07:33.543 --> 07:37.162
Got yourself a lively one
here, Lee, huh?

07:38.915 --> 07:41.666
Can't wait to get
to know you better.

07:50.626 --> 07:55.347
Did you get Adam's
permission to come here?

07:57.433 --> 07:59.951
Did you come back
to kill me?

07:59.953 --> 08:02.921
You wouldn't be here all by
yourself if you really thought that.

08:02.923 --> 08:04.272
Actually, while you've
been gone,

08:04.274 --> 08:07.025
I've been really getting
a hang of this dark magic thing.

08:07.027 --> 08:08.343
So, yeah, I would.

08:08.345 --> 08:09.494
If I wanted to kill you,

08:09.496 --> 08:12.214
I would have left you
in the burning school.

08:12.216 --> 08:14.316
I'm here to save
your life.

08:14.318 --> 08:16.301
By figuring out how
they killed my father?

08:16.303 --> 08:17.702
- Yes.
- How?

08:17.704 --> 08:19.487
You can't ask
anyone's parents

08:19.489 --> 08:21.590
and you can't ask
the witch hunters.

08:21.592 --> 08:26.211
So who's left to tell us
what happened that day?

08:26.213 --> 08:27.462
Me.

08:27.464 --> 08:28.930
What does that mean?

08:28.932 --> 08:31.600
I was there.

08:31.602 --> 08:34.552
At the fire?

08:35.988 --> 08:37.589
How? You would have been
so young.

08:37.591 --> 08:39.557
I was hiding in
my parents' car.

08:39.558 --> 08:41.092
They didn't know
I was there.

08:41.094 --> 08:42.876
Why didn't you say
anything before?

08:42.879 --> 08:45.714
I don't remember much.

08:45.716 --> 08:47.983
I must have
blocked it all out.

08:47.985 --> 08:51.569
So...What?

08:52.872 --> 08:55.123
I think you can
help me remember.

08:55.125 --> 08:58.543
Or maybe even see
what happened for yourself.

08:59.578 --> 09:01.079
How?

09:01.081 --> 09:03.999
You can connect
with others

09:04.001 --> 09:06.234
in ways the rest
of us can't.

09:18.692 --> 09:22.188
On the day of the fire,
my parents were going out.

09:22.189 --> 09:24.472
I didn't want them
to go without me,

09:24.474 --> 09:27.525
so I snuck into
the backseat

09:27.527 --> 09:29.277
and hid under a blanket.

09:29.279 --> 09:32.397
When we got to
the boat yard, they parked,

09:32.399 --> 09:35.150
went onto the ferry.

09:35.152 --> 09:38.253
I waited until they couldn't
see me and followed them.

09:38.255 --> 09:40.835
I snuck up onto the boat,

09:40.860 --> 09:43.073
and that's the last thing
I can remember.

09:44.977 --> 09:46.528
Diana said
you were here.

09:46.530 --> 09:48.296
She didn't mention you brought
along your pet psychopath.

09:48.298 --> 09:51.299
Adam, he was at the fire
16 years ago.

09:51.301 --> 09:53.034
Whatever he saw
was bad enough

09:53.036 --> 09:55.220
that he's blocked it out
completely.

09:55.222 --> 09:56.388
So?

09:56.390 --> 09:58.673
For years I've been working
on a memory spell

09:58.675 --> 10:00.475
that can take me
back to that day

10:00.477 --> 10:03.595
so we can find out
what really happened.

10:03.597 --> 10:06.982
So what makes you think
the spell will work now?

10:06.984 --> 10:10.018
Cassie and her dark magic.

10:10.020 --> 10:11.770
See, there's a disconnect

10:11.772 --> 10:14.589
between Jake's memories
and the consciousness of it.

10:14.591 --> 10:17.892
So if I can link to him
and experience his memory,

10:17.894 --> 10:20.111
maybe I can see
what he's blocked out.

10:20.113 --> 10:22.063
You hear how ridiculous
that sounds?

10:22.065 --> 10:25.250
I did it with Faye
at her grandfather's cabin.

10:25.252 --> 10:29.037
I saw Faye's memory
of herself as a little girl.

10:29.039 --> 10:32.924
It was like she was standing
right in front of us.

10:35.244 --> 10:37.178
Is this spell safe?

10:37.180 --> 10:39.479
The only risk is if
the mind disconnects

10:39.504 --> 10:40.704
from what's real.

10:40.767 --> 10:43.771
By us experiencing it
together, we'll be

10:43.796 --> 10:44.996
grounded to each other.

10:45.155 --> 10:47.605
I barely understand
what that means.

10:47.607 --> 10:49.974
Cassie, please, it's
too much of a risk.

10:49.976 --> 10:53.061
I can't. I can't
just wait around

10:53.063 --> 10:54.446
for these witch hunters
to come at me

10:54.448 --> 10:57.982
with some super special
dark magic killing plan.

10:57.984 --> 11:01.870
I have to find out
what happened that day.

11:03.372 --> 11:05.206
We all do.

11:05.208 --> 11:07.992
This is our only chance.

11:10.663 --> 11:13.448
Chill out,
you'll get it.

11:13.450 --> 11:17.168
Yeah, well, while you're whining,
the price is going up.

11:17.170 --> 11:21.122
So how do you know this guy?

11:21.124 --> 11:22.474
I used to work with him.

11:22.476 --> 11:24.259
Later.

11:24.261 --> 11:25.677
You make it sound
like ancient history.

11:25.679 --> 11:27.762
What's it been,
less than a year?

11:28.931 --> 11:30.231
How's Eva?

11:30.233 --> 11:31.232
Who's Eva?

11:31.234 --> 11:33.435
Old girlfriend.

11:33.437 --> 11:35.103
We lost touch.

11:35.105 --> 11:36.488
Sorry to hear that.

11:37.840 --> 11:41.826
So, are you gonna get me
what I need or what?

11:41.828 --> 11:43.912
You know I don't
deal anymore.

11:43.914 --> 11:45.930
You're a drug dealer?

11:45.932 --> 11:47.115
Was.

11:47.117 --> 11:48.583
Not just any drug.

11:48.585 --> 11:52.287
Purundenga.
The devil's spirit.

11:52.289 --> 11:53.755
What does it do?

11:53.757 --> 11:55.874
Gives you super powers.

11:55.876 --> 11:57.609
What does that mean?

11:57.611 --> 11:58.659
You want to find out?

11:58.661 --> 11:59.627
No, she doesn't.

11:59.629 --> 12:01.946
And like I said,
I don't have any.

12:01.948 --> 12:03.264
I think...

12:03.266 --> 12:06.768
You still know
where to get it.

12:06.770 --> 12:10.221
You got two hours.

12:10.223 --> 12:12.357
Faye, why don't you
take off?

12:12.359 --> 12:15.443
No, no, no, no.
You go, she stays.

12:16.729 --> 12:18.580
Why don't we leave
her out of this?

12:20.066 --> 12:21.399
Lee thinks I might
hurt you.

12:21.401 --> 12:24.736
But why would I?
I don't have a reason to.

12:24.738 --> 12:26.354
Do I, Lee?

12:26.356 --> 12:27.855
Go ahead, Lee.
I'll stay.

12:27.857 --> 12:29.057
No way.

12:29.059 --> 12:31.859
It's ok.
I'm sure Callum here

12:31.861 --> 12:33.828
will be the perfect
gentleman.

12:36.415 --> 12:37.882
You sure?

12:41.870 --> 12:45.890
All right.
Be right back.

12:57.820 --> 13:00.522
Hey.

13:01.941 --> 13:03.942
Your text said
it was important.

13:03.944 --> 13:06.092
Cassie's gonna do this
crazy memory spell

13:06.417 --> 13:07.546
with Jake tonight.

13:07.547 --> 13:08.613
What does that mean?

13:08.615 --> 13:12.951
Jake was there
the day of the fire

13:12.953 --> 13:15.620
that killed our parents.

13:15.622 --> 13:18.790
They want to spell his memory
and have Cassie access it

13:18.792 --> 13:20.208
like she did with Faye.

13:20.210 --> 13:22.527
So they might be
able to see our parents,

13:22.529 --> 13:24.429
find out what really
happened that day.

13:24.431 --> 13:26.214
Yeah, that's the idea,
but it's too risky.

13:26.216 --> 13:28.683
And Jake has her convinced
that it's fine.

13:28.685 --> 13:31.820
She's a big girl, and I don't
blame her for wanting to.

13:31.822 --> 13:33.655
I'd do it, too,
if I could.

13:33.657 --> 13:38.526
Just to see them,
to know the truth.

13:40.262 --> 13:42.564
Everybody in the circle
had their lives destroyed that day.

13:42.566 --> 13:44.616
We should all be there.

14:08.974 --> 14:10.758
This is
where it happened?

14:10.760 --> 14:12.010
Yeah.

14:12.012 --> 14:14.395
Which one is it?

14:16.749 --> 14:19.901
Are you sure you wanna
try this?

14:19.903 --> 14:23.521
Yeah.

14:23.523 --> 14:25.306
I have to know.

14:25.308 --> 14:27.692
Me, too.

14:36.443 --> 14:40.314
Ok, so what do you remember
after getting out of the car?

14:40.373 --> 14:42.590
I could hear people
on the boat.

14:42.592 --> 14:46.010
I could hear sounds
all around me, up on deck,

14:46.012 --> 14:49.497
behind closed doors.

14:49.499 --> 14:52.967
But I couldn't find
my parents anywhere.

14:55.087 --> 14:56.671
That's all.

14:56.673 --> 14:58.723
I remember coming
down here,

14:58.725 --> 15:04.362
but everything
after this is really foggy.

15:05.614 --> 15:08.666
Whatever I saw,
whatever happened,

15:08.668 --> 15:10.068
it was down here.

15:15.541 --> 15:17.625
For the spell we need something
from the boat

15:17.627 --> 15:20.361
that would have been
here 16 years ago.

15:28.504 --> 15:31.539
Hey, Dawn.
What can I get you?

15:31.541 --> 15:34.726
A drink.

15:37.546 --> 15:39.180
Is everything all right?

15:39.182 --> 15:42.150
Not really.

15:42.152 --> 15:44.852
Can I help?

15:44.854 --> 15:48.055
You're sweet.

15:48.057 --> 15:50.108
You always were.

15:51.160 --> 15:53.945
I remember when you and
Amelia started dating.

15:53.947 --> 15:58.499
I envied how you were
always there for her.

15:58.501 --> 16:01.703
She was
a lucky girl.

16:01.705 --> 16:04.605
I don't think she
saw it that way.

16:04.607 --> 16:07.508
Things got confusing
for all of us.

16:11.296 --> 16:13.431
So, what's going on?

16:13.433 --> 16:15.633
It's nothing.

16:15.635 --> 16:18.019
Dawn.

16:20.723 --> 16:23.224
It's Charles.

16:23.226 --> 16:25.693
What happened?

16:26.912 --> 16:29.731
We got in
an argument and...

16:32.034 --> 16:33.484
Things got heated.

16:33.486 --> 16:35.319
Did he do something
to you?

16:37.539 --> 16:39.607
He choked me.

16:43.079 --> 16:44.996
What is it?

16:46.882 --> 16:49.584
He did the same thing to me.

16:51.553 --> 16:53.054
Dawn, you've got to
press charges.

16:53.056 --> 16:55.056
- I can't.
- Why the hell not?

16:58.310 --> 17:00.094
He did magic.

17:00.096 --> 17:03.314
Ethan, he has a crystal.
I saw it.

17:03.316 --> 17:04.348
Then I'll take care
of him.

17:04.349 --> 17:05.400
He's dangerous.

17:05.402 --> 17:07.151
You know Charles and I
have never gotten along.

17:07.153 --> 17:11.439
He was a bully back then,
and he still is.

17:11.441 --> 17:14.659
But I will not let him
get away with it anymore.

17:16.779 --> 17:18.279
Thank you.

17:19.647 --> 17:21.315
When you get
the crystal,

17:21.317 --> 17:25.586
we'll figure out the safest way
to get rid of it.

17:29.425 --> 17:32.343
Is this you, Nick,
and your parents?

17:35.297 --> 17:38.966
It's the only picture I have
of my mother and father.

17:42.438 --> 17:46.441
So, what do we do now?

17:46.443 --> 17:48.893
Read the spell
out loud.

17:48.895 --> 17:49.861
Ok.

17:49.863 --> 17:52.179
Touch the dirt and ashes from
the boat.

17:52.181 --> 17:55.450
Visualize the night
of the fire.

18:11.650 --> 18:15.753
Corpore intin,
comsera en praterum.

18:15.755 --> 18:20.007
Corpore intin,
comsera en praterum.

18:31.052 --> 18:33.204
What's happening?

18:33.206 --> 18:35.857
It worked.

18:44.672 --> 18:45.872
No luck?

18:45.874 --> 18:47.707
Melissa went to Seattle
with her dad

18:47.709 --> 18:48.925
and Faye's phone is off.

18:48.927 --> 18:51.244
I left her a message to meet
us at the abandoned house.

18:51.246 --> 18:53.463
So it's just us?

18:53.465 --> 18:56.800
I feel like the circle
is falling apart.

18:58.436 --> 19:00.470
Maybe finding out
the truth about that day

19:00.472 --> 19:02.755
will bring us
back together.

19:10.599 --> 19:13.116
Ethan.
What do you want?

19:13.118 --> 19:15.418
I know you have a crystal

19:15.420 --> 19:17.696
and that you killed
Henry Chamberlain

19:17.721 --> 19:18.823
when he found out.

19:18.824 --> 19:21.374
Are you drunk?
You should sleep it off.

19:21.376 --> 19:23.944
I'm sober as
a church mouse, Charles.

19:23.946 --> 19:25.745
I'm telling the elders.

19:25.747 --> 19:27.380
They'll stop you.

19:27.382 --> 19:29.216
You can't kill them all.

19:39.060 --> 19:40.227
What do we do now?

19:42.431 --> 19:43.463
Come on,
we're gonna be late.

19:43.465 --> 19:44.681
What if someone sees us?

19:44.683 --> 19:45.798
We're gonna be fine.

19:50.971 --> 19:53.106
Hey!

19:53.108 --> 19:55.275
I guess they can't.

19:55.277 --> 19:57.410
This is so strange.

20:07.655 --> 20:09.489
Is that?

20:10.458 --> 20:12.342
My parents.

20:12.344 --> 20:13.760
Come on, let's
follow them.

20:13.762 --> 20:15.428
Aah!

20:17.164 --> 20:18.164
What's wrong?

20:18.166 --> 20:20.166
I don't know.
My head.

20:20.168 --> 20:21.301
Are you ok?

20:21.303 --> 20:23.670
Yeah.

20:24.639 --> 20:27.107
All right, come on.

20:28.192 --> 20:29.609
Sarah, listen to me.

20:29.611 --> 20:30.944
The witch hunters don't
want to kill

20:30.946 --> 20:31.895
if they don't have to.

20:31.897 --> 20:33.146
They promised me.

20:33.148 --> 20:34.197
I can't hear what
they're saying.

20:34.199 --> 20:35.282
We need to get
closer.

20:35.284 --> 20:36.566
It's getting worse.

20:36.568 --> 20:39.369
My memory, everything's
getting confusing.

20:39.371 --> 20:40.853
If we agree to stop
practicing,

20:40.855 --> 20:42.489
they'll agree
to leave us alone.

20:42.491 --> 20:43.573
It's true.
It's the right thing to do.

20:43.575 --> 20:45.542
Yeah, but John says
we shouldn't trust them.

20:45.544 --> 20:47.327
And you believe
his instincts over mine?

20:47.329 --> 20:49.329
What is it about Blackwell?

20:49.331 --> 20:50.630
They're talking
about my father.

20:50.632 --> 20:52.499
We...We have to
follow them.

20:52.501 --> 20:54.167
I--I can't.

20:54.169 --> 20:55.919
Something terrible
is about to happen.

20:55.921 --> 20:57.087
What?

20:57.089 --> 20:59.222
We have to get
out of here.

21:00.257 --> 21:02.092
I have to find
my father.

21:02.094 --> 21:04.043
No, no.

21:04.045 --> 21:06.680
Everything past here
is completely blocked.

21:06.682 --> 21:07.814
We can't go any further.

21:07.816 --> 21:08.881
I have to.

21:08.883 --> 21:10.717
You can't.

21:10.719 --> 21:12.319
It's too dangerous
otherwise.

21:12.321 --> 21:13.820
We have to stay together.

21:14.605 --> 21:17.073
I need to see
what happened.

21:17.992 --> 21:20.226
Cassie.

21:21.112 --> 21:23.997
Cassie!

21:31.055 --> 21:32.372
Cassie?

21:32.374 --> 21:34.174
Cassie, come back.

21:34.176 --> 21:35.175
Cassie!

21:35.177 --> 21:36.343
Please come back.

21:36.345 --> 21:37.844
Cassie, come back.

21:45.951 --> 21:48.119
Just talk to John,
ok?

21:48.121 --> 21:49.821
Hear what
he has to say.

21:49.823 --> 21:52.207
They're waiting for us
to agree to the truce.

21:52.209 --> 21:54.659
I'm not going to go back
to town to find Blackwell--

21:54.661 --> 21:57.212
John's here.

21:57.214 --> 21:58.996
He's on the deck
upstairs.

21:58.998 --> 22:00.548
It's too late.

22:00.550 --> 22:02.166
Tom's already inside.

22:02.168 --> 22:03.351
So is Sophie Ann.

22:03.353 --> 22:05.470
But Dawn's up on deck
with Charles.

22:05.472 --> 22:07.972
They agree with John.

22:07.974 --> 22:10.024
There's no truce without
the whole circle.

22:10.026 --> 22:12.527
Someone has to take
the first step.

22:12.529 --> 22:15.012
If we show our support,
maybe the others will follow.

22:15.014 --> 22:16.681
Amelia's not even here.

22:16.683 --> 22:19.951
She won't go near John with
the way he betrayed her.

22:19.953 --> 22:23.020
I'm worried that the
circle is falling apart.

22:23.022 --> 22:24.539
Maybe we should let it.

22:24.541 --> 22:27.375
We've already taken things
farther than we should have.

22:27.377 --> 22:31.296
If we agree
to stop practicing,

22:31.298 --> 22:32.997
we'll be safe again.

22:36.969 --> 22:39.537
Ok.

22:39.539 --> 22:41.222
You're right.

22:41.224 --> 22:42.757
Let's end this

22:42.759 --> 22:46.411
and go home
to our children.

22:54.770 --> 22:57.388
Ethan.

22:59.325 --> 23:00.725
What are you doing here?

23:02.895 --> 23:04.863
See, I told you Eben
would show.

23:04.865 --> 23:06.164
My wife there thought
you--

23:08.918 --> 23:09.918
No!

23:09.920 --> 23:11.920
No! No!

23:20.245 --> 23:22.297
No!

23:22.299 --> 23:24.966
You husband should have
listened to you.

23:41.266 --> 23:45.870
Oh, my God, Lucy.

23:45.872 --> 23:48.039
Mommy.

23:48.041 --> 23:50.225
Jake.

23:50.227 --> 23:52.911
Cassie, come back to me.
Come back!

23:52.913 --> 23:54.412
Come back, Cassie,
please.

23:54.414 --> 23:55.880
Get your hands off her.

23:55.882 --> 23:56.998
What happened?

23:57.000 --> 23:59.250
We went to my memory.
We saw my parents.

23:59.252 --> 24:00.318
She followed them.

24:00.320 --> 24:02.470
And then what?
Where is she now?

24:02.472 --> 24:04.772
We need to stop this.
Do a spell to bring her back.

24:04.774 --> 24:07.392
That won't make
things worse?

24:13.015 --> 24:16.651
Can you believe
the junk he has?

24:18.771 --> 24:20.021
Not a fan of masks?

24:20.023 --> 24:21.890
Not since Halloween.

24:21.892 --> 24:29.614
Well, we all wear masks,
every day.

24:37.756 --> 24:40.091
Just a non-addictive
herbal enhancement.

24:40.093 --> 24:43.878
But it has
special properties.

24:43.880 --> 24:46.164
It'll open up your mind,

24:46.166 --> 24:47.832
free you
from inhibition.

24:47.834 --> 24:52.520
For someone like you who I can
see isn't afraid of anything,

24:52.522 --> 24:56.007
it would tap into
your inner strength

24:56.009 --> 25:02.113
and give you the power to have
or do anything you want.

25:03.283 --> 25:05.033
The hell?

25:05.868 --> 25:08.019
Keep your panties on.
We were just talking.

25:08.021 --> 25:10.488
Is that it?

25:15.794 --> 25:17.295
Leave. Go.

25:17.297 --> 25:20.164
Want to try some, Faye?
It's a rush.

25:20.166 --> 25:21.332
I said leave.

25:30.809 --> 25:31.893
Damn it, Faye!

25:31.895 --> 25:33.227
I just cleaned up
the place

25:33.229 --> 25:34.762
from the last time
you trashed it.

25:34.764 --> 25:36.898
You're acting like
idiots.

25:36.900 --> 25:38.399
No, no, it's ok.
Lee here was just trying

25:38.401 --> 25:39.600
to protect you
from crazy Callum.

25:39.602 --> 25:42.020
Kind of touching,
actually.

25:42.022 --> 25:43.187
Get out.

25:45.858 --> 25:48.359
See you around.

26:05.077 --> 26:08.062
John Blackwell.

26:08.064 --> 26:11.466
You've been accused
and found guilty.

26:11.468 --> 26:14.185
Have you anything
to say?

26:14.187 --> 26:17.772
Admit your guilt.
Confess your sins.

26:17.774 --> 26:21.209
Die with peace.

26:21.211 --> 26:23.260
You know you can't kill me.

26:23.262 --> 26:25.313
Couldn't kill you.

26:27.483 --> 26:29.901
Not without a
dark root colocasia.

26:29.903 --> 26:32.086
Get that away from me.

26:33.739 --> 26:38.126
Tenebras dissipare.
Omne evum.

26:38.128 --> 26:39.410
Go to hell.

26:39.412 --> 26:42.714
No, John, hell is
where you're going.

26:58.130 --> 26:59.680
No!

27:01.734 --> 27:03.401
What are you doing here?

27:03.403 --> 27:04.736
You don't belong here.

27:04.738 --> 27:06.437
You--you can see me?

27:06.439 --> 27:08.856
Get out. Now.

27:08.858 --> 27:10.575
Come with me.

27:29.462 --> 27:30.478
What's happening?

27:32.432 --> 27:33.881
She's suffocating.

27:33.883 --> 27:36.100
She's choking
on the smoke.

27:37.994 --> 27:40.015
Her brain's telling her

27:40.016 --> 27:41.348
that's she's really
in the fire.

27:42.061 --> 27:43.144
All right, we have
no choice now,

27:43.146 --> 27:44.362
we have to do
something.

27:44.364 --> 27:46.364
Put your hands
on her.

27:46.366 --> 27:48.199
Concentrate on
expanding her lungs.

27:48.201 --> 27:50.651
Breathe. Breathe, Cassie.

27:50.653 --> 27:52.870
Breathe. Breathe.

27:52.872 --> 27:54.372
Breathe.

27:54.374 --> 27:56.040
Breathe.

27:57.442 --> 28:00.461
Breathe. Breathe.

28:03.448 --> 28:06.517
You've got to go back
and get her out.

28:06.519 --> 28:09.637
I don't think I can.

28:09.639 --> 28:11.556
I don't give a damn
about your blocked memories.

28:11.558 --> 28:14.425
You took her there,
now get her the hell out.

28:21.500 --> 28:24.652
Read this spell.

28:27.639 --> 28:31.943
Corpore intin,
comsera en praterum.

28:31.945 --> 28:36.664
Corpore intin,
comsera en praterum.

28:36.666 --> 28:40.835
Corpore intin,
comsera en praterum.

28:40.837 --> 28:42.920
Corpore...

28:42.922 --> 28:46.007
Aah!

29:07.779 --> 29:11.616
Ignidissipare et vallum.

29:21.910 --> 29:23.077
Aah!

29:58.530 --> 30:00.948
Cassie!

30:13.244 --> 30:14.378
Are you ok?

30:15.548 --> 30:17.247
Help! Can anybody here me?

30:17.249 --> 30:19.750
No, no, no! Mom!

30:19.752 --> 30:21.986
Is anyone there?

30:34.100 --> 30:37.902
Cassie, hey.

30:45.210 --> 30:47.542
Trust me, I could kick
Callum's ass all over

30:47.567 --> 30:48.767
Chance Harbor if I wanted.

30:48.831 --> 30:50.915
Mm-hmm.

30:50.917 --> 30:52.800
But I'd like to keep him
in my past.

30:52.802 --> 30:55.336
And what about
this Eva?

30:55.338 --> 30:56.837
Is she really
in your past

30:56.839 --> 30:58.973
or is she about
to walk through the door?

31:00.475 --> 31:04.211
I stopped dealing
devil's spirit for a reason.

31:04.213 --> 31:07.431
I kept telling her
to stay away from it,

31:07.433 --> 31:08.933
but she wouldn't listen.

31:08.935 --> 31:10.518
She died.

31:10.520 --> 31:12.570
She took too much?

31:15.474 --> 31:17.591
It destroyed her.

31:20.412 --> 31:22.530
I'm sorry.

31:30.038 --> 31:32.089
It was awful.

31:32.091 --> 31:34.208
The truce was a trap.

31:34.210 --> 31:38.328
And I think the circle, they were
split over who to believe.

31:38.330 --> 31:41.832
Those who trusted the witch hunters
were lead into the cafeteria

31:41.834 --> 31:45.686
of the boat
and massacred.

31:47.139 --> 31:48.472
You saw your father?

31:48.474 --> 31:50.758
I didn't see his face.

31:50.760 --> 31:53.961
But he was standing
right in front of me.

31:53.963 --> 31:57.314
He got out.
He didn't die in that room

31:57.316 --> 31:58.899
like the witch hunters
thought.

31:58.901 --> 32:02.953
All these years,
I believed Isaac

32:02.955 --> 32:04.266
when he said the witches

32:04.291 --> 32:06.229
were the ones who started
the fire that night.

32:06.492 --> 32:11.128
No.

32:11.130 --> 32:13.831
It was definitely
the witch hunters.

32:13.833 --> 32:15.416
I saw them.

32:15.418 --> 32:18.469
They started the fire when
they tried to kill my father.

32:21.306 --> 32:23.340
Your mother
was so brave.

32:23.342 --> 32:25.976
Your father, too.

32:25.978 --> 32:29.063
All he wanted was
for them to be safe.

32:29.065 --> 32:30.898
What about the rest
of them?

32:30.900 --> 32:32.850
Did you see my mother?

32:32.852 --> 32:34.652
Was my mom in
the cafeteria?

32:34.654 --> 32:35.886
I don't know.

32:35.888 --> 32:38.823
I could hear things going on
in other parts of the boat,

32:38.825 --> 32:41.775
but I'm
not sure what.

32:41.777 --> 32:43.661
I'm sorry.

32:45.113 --> 32:47.064
But I saw your dad.

32:47.066 --> 32:49.033
He was coming out
of the room.

32:49.035 --> 32:50.151
That's impossible.

32:50.153 --> 32:51.335
My dad wasn't there
that day.

32:51.337 --> 32:52.853
You must have seen
someone else.

32:52.855 --> 32:55.039
No, I saw his face
and heard his name.

32:55.041 --> 32:57.791
Why would he lie?

33:05.717 --> 33:07.384
Let's get out of here.

33:10.922 --> 33:13.190
I'll catch up with
you guys later.

33:13.192 --> 33:15.476
Are you sure?

34:44.273 --> 34:45.806
I was right.

34:45.808 --> 34:49.359
You did kill
Henry Chamberlain.

34:49.360 --> 34:53.230
Otherwise, why come
after me with this?

34:56.918 --> 34:59.369
I didn't kill
anybody.

34:59.371 --> 35:03.490
You're a bully, Charles.
You always were.

35:03.492 --> 35:06.109
First me, then Dawn.

35:06.111 --> 35:09.396
Dawn?

35:09.398 --> 35:11.365
She put you
up to this?

35:11.367 --> 35:13.934
She's playing you,
Ethan.

35:13.936 --> 35:16.470
It's what she does.

35:16.472 --> 35:17.967
You're a fool.

35:17.992 --> 35:19.192
As soon as she gets
the crystal back,

35:19.842 --> 35:23.510
you're dead, just like Henry.
She killed him.

35:23.512 --> 35:24.895
You expect me
to believe that?

35:24.897 --> 35:27.064
Power is very
intoxicating.

35:27.066 --> 35:29.182
You should know that
as well as anyone.

35:29.184 --> 35:30.217
Shut up.

35:30.219 --> 35:32.069
Look, you don't want
to repeat history.

35:32.071 --> 35:35.305
It's not too late.
Just walk away.

35:35.307 --> 35:39.342
I said shut up.

35:55.159 --> 35:56.760
Ethan.

35:56.762 --> 36:00.814
That's enough.
That's enough.

36:00.816 --> 36:04.017
Get out.

36:25.289 --> 36:27.857
Sorry if I scared you.

36:37.301 --> 36:41.555
The horror that you
saw that day,

36:41.557 --> 36:44.224
maybe it should have
stayed locked away.

36:44.226 --> 36:45.759
No.

36:45.761 --> 36:49.846
I wasn't just
blocking out a memory.

36:49.848 --> 36:52.315
I was blocking out
the truth.

36:52.317 --> 36:55.769
That's why it was so easy for
Isaac to manipulate me.

36:55.771 --> 36:58.188
I believed our parents
were destroyed

36:58.190 --> 37:01.291
by the destructive thirst
for power,

37:01.293 --> 37:03.443
not that they were murdered.

37:05.913 --> 37:07.030
I found this.

37:07.032 --> 37:10.717
My father was wearing it the day
of the fire.

37:10.719 --> 37:12.118
It saved him.

37:12.120 --> 37:14.754
So you're safe
from them now.

37:14.756 --> 37:17.491
Glad I came back.

37:17.493 --> 37:22.078
Is that the only
reason that you did?

37:22.080 --> 37:24.581
No.

37:24.583 --> 37:27.934
Maybe I was too late.

37:33.057 --> 37:38.411
Everything's just really
complicated right now.

37:38.413 --> 37:41.648
I can't stop thinking
about my father.

37:41.650 --> 37:45.268
If he really did
get off this ferry,

37:45.270 --> 37:49.606
then is there a chance
that he's still alive?

37:49.608 --> 37:50.848
Why would he let people

37:50.873 --> 37:52.775
believe he's been dead
for all these years?

37:53.095 --> 37:56.779
I don't know.

37:58.499 --> 38:01.551
He's buried at
Harbor cemetery,

38:01.553 --> 38:04.337
not too far from my parents.

38:13.848 --> 38:17.350
Do you still think
Jake came back to hurt us?

38:18.569 --> 38:23.139
I don't know what
I believe anymore.

38:23.141 --> 38:27.193
You do realize he's
in love with Cassie.

38:29.530 --> 38:31.364
Yeah.

38:35.819 --> 38:38.238
I don't know
how to do this.

38:38.240 --> 38:40.457
Do what?

38:42.593 --> 38:46.129
Us.

38:46.131 --> 38:49.099
Being friends.

38:52.553 --> 38:56.473
Me neither.

38:56.475 --> 39:01.361
But we have to.

39:01.363 --> 39:04.864
Anyway, nobody else
knows me like you do.

39:15.042 --> 39:16.192
Ethan, what happened?

39:16.194 --> 39:18.495
Did Charles hurt you?

39:18.497 --> 39:21.498
No. I got the crystal.

39:21.500 --> 39:23.366
Oh, thank God.

39:23.368 --> 39:24.701
Where is it?

39:24.703 --> 39:26.920
It's safe.

39:26.922 --> 39:29.556
Can I see it?

39:29.558 --> 39:32.375
Tomorrow. Ok?

39:32.377 --> 39:34.511
Ethan.
For tonight...

39:34.513 --> 39:38.515
I think I'll just
hold onto it.

39:38.517 --> 39:41.601
Good.

39:41.603 --> 39:43.520
Hold onto it.

39:43.522 --> 39:45.105
I'll see you
tomorrow.

40:03.240 --> 40:05.542
Stay where you are
or I'll scream.

40:05.544 --> 40:09.095
Ohh. Just brought you
a little present.

40:09.097 --> 40:12.415
Devil's spirit.

40:12.417 --> 40:13.933
No, thanks.

40:13.935 --> 40:16.436
No problem.

40:16.438 --> 40:18.355
It's just you expressed
some interest

40:18.357 --> 40:22.809
and I'm very sensitive
to a pretty girl's needs.

40:26.230 --> 40:29.799
Call me if you develop
any more needs.

40:31.452 --> 40:34.704
Don't hold
your breath.

40:36.992 --> 40:38.579
Just want you
to know I realize

40:38.604 --> 40:40.209
this is kind of insane.

40:40.362 --> 40:43.329
Yeah.

40:43.331 --> 40:46.299
I just need to know
if my father's alive.

40:49.587 --> 40:51.921
Wait.

41:04.185 --> 41:06.319
Go ahead.
