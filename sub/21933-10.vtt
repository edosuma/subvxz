WEBVTT

00:02.203 --> 00:04.105
Rootger, come sit.
Daily meeting.

00:04.172 --> 00:06.707
No, I can hear you from here.
No, no, that's why
I got the table.

00:06.774 --> 00:08.709
So we could have
team meetings,
like a real company.

00:08.776 --> 00:10.044
So, I lost my desk

00:10.111 --> 00:11.512
just so that we could have
team meetings?

00:11.579 --> 00:13.247
Yeah, and this one's
getting off to a bumpy start

00:13.314 --> 00:15.916
because of
that attitude.
Okay.

00:15.983 --> 00:17.418
This table is pretty nice.

00:17.485 --> 00:19.187
Yeah. Thank you,
Rootger, very much.
Yeah.

00:19.253 --> 00:20.654
All right. (CLEARS THROAT)

00:20.721 --> 00:22.556
First order of business...

00:23.124 --> 00:24.458
Hmm.

00:24.525 --> 00:26.026
I have nothing.
Vanessa, you have the floor.

00:26.094 --> 00:27.128
It's all you.
Go ahead.

00:27.195 --> 00:28.929
Well, unfortunately,

00:28.996 --> 00:30.664
I have to start
on a bad note.

00:30.731 --> 00:33.234
We did not
get the security gig
at the Billy Joel concert.

00:33.301 --> 00:35.436
It went to Nassau Security.

00:35.503 --> 00:37.271
(ROOTGER SIGHS)
Unbelievable.
We lost out to those guys?

00:37.338 --> 00:39.407
Well, they are ex-Navy SEALs.
I mean...

00:39.473 --> 00:40.308
Yeah. Ex.

00:40.374 --> 00:41.609
Have you seen
'em lately?

00:41.675 --> 00:44.378
They look like actual seals.
(CHUCKLES)

00:44.445 --> 00:45.713
All they do is they eat,
and they lay...

00:45.779 --> 00:47.781
Lay on the beach
and stuff, like...

00:51.285 --> 00:53.721
Continue. Continue.
Go ahead. Go ahead.

00:53.787 --> 00:54.955
We did get one account.

00:55.022 --> 00:57.258
It's from
a small law firm,

00:57.325 --> 00:59.227
but it could lead
to bigger things.

00:59.293 --> 01:00.494
Okay. Hit me with it.
Let's do it.

01:00.561 --> 01:02.563
All right,
well, it's a divorce case.

01:02.630 --> 01:06.134
A woman thinks that her
husband's cooking the books
to keep his alimony low.

01:06.200 --> 01:08.336
He, uh... He owns
Westbury Auto Mall.

01:08.402 --> 01:10.904
All right, so I guess we got
to get in there somehow,

01:10.971 --> 01:12.673
locate the safe,
and then just

01:12.740 --> 01:14.642
figure out a way
to crack it, right?

01:14.708 --> 01:16.177
I can get some C-4.

01:17.378 --> 01:18.812
Nah, I think it's a little
too much club.

01:18.879 --> 01:20.714
Probably take out
the Hallmark store next to it.

01:20.781 --> 01:23.551
We're not doing any of that.
No one's cracking anything.

01:23.617 --> 01:25.319
We got to do something,
all right?

01:25.386 --> 01:27.388
I say we go undercover,

01:27.455 --> 01:28.989
get in there,
and, believe me,

01:29.056 --> 01:30.758
we'll get all
the information we need.

01:30.824 --> 01:33.361
Yeah, actually, you know what?
That's not a bad idea.

01:33.427 --> 01:34.695
I mean, I know the maintenance
people there.

01:34.762 --> 01:37.231
Maybe I can get in
on the cleaning crew.

01:37.298 --> 01:38.466
What do you mean, you?
First of all,

01:38.532 --> 01:40.534
I just said that.
It was my idea.

01:40.601 --> 01:44.238
I understand that,
but you tend to lose focus.

01:44.305 --> 01:46.174
Let me just get in there,
get it done. In, out.

01:46.240 --> 01:47.808
No. You're not a janitor.

01:47.875 --> 01:49.277
Look at you,
you're all prissy
with your bracelets

01:49.343 --> 01:51.745
and the jingles
and, "Oh, I..."

01:51.812 --> 01:52.680
Okay.

01:52.746 --> 01:55.349
No. This... Look.
This is a janitor.

01:55.416 --> 01:57.318
Yes.
Right? Thank you, Rootger.

01:57.385 --> 01:59.320
I would also believe you
as a... As a deli guy

01:59.387 --> 02:00.788
who makes nice sandwiches.

02:02.356 --> 02:03.757
Okay, you can go
back outside now.

you've got out there.

I don't work in...

02:41.295 --> 02:42.430
Does the third row go flat?

02:42.496 --> 02:44.031
We need the extra space.

02:44.097 --> 02:46.200
Well, it's definitely got
the extra space. I know that.

02:46.267 --> 02:47.301
And the third row
does go flat.

02:47.368 --> 02:48.569
I know it only
'cause of my buddy.

02:48.636 --> 02:50.170
He's... He's got
the exact same car.

02:50.238 --> 02:52.773
Actually, a few months ago,
he was on the way
to a Jet game,

02:52.840 --> 02:55.008
and his pregnant wife
felt a little kick.

you just sold us.

ready to buy.

you don't.

about you,

of that board in no time.

Absolutely.

gets you that Vespa.

Mario Batali rode

04:01.842 --> 04:03.344
in Food Warriors.

04:04.144 --> 04:05.546
It is the one.

of mine.

a Harley's a little too much.

you're speaking,

with words.

um, some... I, um...

04:32.039 --> 04:33.273
Thank you.

04:36.577 --> 04:38.278
All right.
I did it.

04:38.346 --> 04:40.848
Good for you.
Did what?

04:40.914 --> 04:43.317
I signed up to audition
for the school play.

04:43.384 --> 04:44.852
You said you'd help me.
So, let's do it.

Today? Oh, no, Jack.
I'm sorry. I can't.

04:48.522 --> 04:50.924
I have to be at Enzo's
in like five minutes.

04:50.991 --> 04:52.393

for the school play.

04:57.765 --> 04:59.266
Really? Huh.

04:59.333 --> 05:01.702
I didn't realize there
was a fellow thespian
in the house.

05:02.536 --> 05:04.405
That means he used
to act.

05:04.472 --> 05:05.873
Some call it "acting."

05:05.939 --> 05:09.009
Others say that I
"held a mirror up to society."

05:09.076 --> 05:11.679
And that means
he thinks he was good.

05:11.745 --> 05:13.280
Okay, so,
you can help him?

05:13.347 --> 05:16.016

"Bullying: Don't Do It."

Mr. Gronk, wrote it.

05:27.461 --> 05:29.229
Oh, well.
We all start somewhere.

05:29.296 --> 05:32.633
But don't worry. I've got
a lot of tricks in my bag.

05:32.700 --> 05:35.703
Now, where does
our journey begin?

05:35.769 --> 05:39.072
Oh, I take some kid's milk
and flick him in the ear.

05:39.139 --> 05:44.044
Right. But that's probably
just a metaphor for, um...

05:44.111 --> 05:46.647
Oh, no.
You just take some milk,
flick a kid in the ear.

05:49.450 --> 05:50.984
Hey.
Hey. There you are.

05:51.051 --> 05:52.786
Well, what'd you find out?
Did you get the sales numbers?

05:52.853 --> 05:55.889
I did not, but I got
something way better.

05:55.956 --> 05:57.224
A promotion.

05:57.290 --> 05:58.826
Boom!

06:00.060 --> 06:01.495

to sales.

06:01.562 --> 06:02.963
What're you talking about?

06:03.030 --> 06:05.399
What am I talking about?
I sold three cars today.

06:05.466 --> 06:06.934
A Camry, an Elantra,
and then a...

06:07.000 --> 06:10.404
Okay, what about the job
that you were there to do?

06:10.471 --> 06:12.573
Let me finish.
And a Tahoe.

06:15.876 --> 06:18.546
You do realize that Jerry's
not your friend, right?

06:18.612 --> 06:20.313
He's the guy that
we're supposed to nail.

06:20.380 --> 06:22.082
Yeah, speaking of nails,
by the way,
he gave me a nickname.

06:22.149 --> 06:25.919
He calls me "The Hammer,"
because I hammer deals shut!

06:27.354 --> 06:29.457
Killin' it.
Okay. Hey. Hey!

06:29.523 --> 06:30.658
I need you to focus.
Yeah.

06:30.724 --> 06:33.026
Can you focus?
Yeah. I'm focused.

06:33.093 --> 06:34.227
I spoke to the client.

06:34.294 --> 06:36.363
She said that Jerry
keeps his sales numbers

06:36.430 --> 06:37.965
on a purple thumb drive
in his safe.

06:38.031 --> 06:39.700
Yeah, you know what?
I saw it. It's in his office.

06:39.767 --> 06:41.401
And, by the way,
now that I'm a salesman,

06:41.469 --> 06:42.603
I have access to that.

06:42.670 --> 06:44.705
That is

and just get it done, okay?

06:49.209 --> 06:50.678
I'm sorry. Who do you
want to go in there?

06:50.744 --> 06:51.445
I am not calling you
"The Hammer," so...

06:51.512 --> 06:52.713
You just did.

06:57.217 --> 06:59.186
"Hey, kid. Nice milk."

06:59.252 --> 07:00.554
"Leave me alone, Duke."

07:00.621 --> 07:03.156
"I will. Right after
I drink your milk!"

07:03.223 --> 07:05.025
Okay, hold. Hold.

07:05.092 --> 07:06.860
That's a hold.
What are you doing, Jack?

07:06.927 --> 07:08.328
Well, I'm saying
the lines.

07:08.395 --> 07:10.464
Exactly.
You're saying them.

07:10.531 --> 07:12.866
I need you to feel them.

07:12.933 --> 07:15.469
Look, when you're out there,
there is no Jack.

07:15.536 --> 07:17.471
There is only Duke,

and eventual hero.

07:19.540 --> 07:20.808
Find it. Go.

07:21.942 --> 07:23.143

07:23.210 --> 07:24.512
No, not lou...

Look...

07:25.879 --> 07:27.347

to impart in you

07:27.414 --> 07:30.518
is that you need to feel
your character's pain, okay?

Here, a little
acting trick.

07:32.285 --> 07:34.888

place it in your shoe.

And then, every time you
feel the pain in your foot,

07:37.324 --> 07:41.161
you will actually be feeling
the pain in Duke's heart.

07:41.228 --> 07:44.231

with a rock in my shoe?

07:44.297 --> 07:45.666
Yes!

understand why Duke

is picking on, um...

07:48.902 --> 07:51.038
"Boy eating sandwich"
on page five?

07:51.104 --> 07:53.507

than this, Mr. Gronk.

07:56.510 --> 07:57.778
Coffee, Mr. Hammer?

07:57.845 --> 07:59.379
You know what?
Make it a latte, Maritza.

07:59.446 --> 08:00.514

checking out the car, sport.

17:03.590 --> 17:04.557
You're only, uh,

17:04.624 --> 17:06.193
two away from winning
that Vespa.

17:06.259 --> 17:07.827
Oh, it's happening.
(CHUCKLES)

17:07.894 --> 17:10.863
You know, I read that you can
slap a fuel injector on it,

17:10.930 --> 17:13.533
get her up to 50, 55.

17:13.600 --> 17:14.901
Safe? No.

17:14.967 --> 17:16.636
Fun? You betcha.

17:16.703 --> 17:17.870
(BOTH LAUGHING)

17:17.937 --> 17:20.940
Would you stop talking
about the stupid Vespa?

17:21.007 --> 17:22.542
Yeah, he's not focused.

17:22.609 --> 17:24.577
But, you know,
it is interesting
about the Vespa.

17:24.644 --> 17:27.180
I did not know
it could go that fast.

17:27.247 --> 17:30.150
Rootger, I might need
a little of this.

17:30.217 --> 17:32.852
Actually, I wanted
to give you one of these.

17:32.919 --> 17:35.555
You know, just a little
thank you for, uh,

17:35.622 --> 17:39.092
allowing me to work in your
fine used-car establishment.

17:39.159 --> 17:41.761
Wow, an Arturo Magnifico.

17:41.828 --> 17:44.231
I'll only smoke one
if you'll have one with me.

17:44.297 --> 17:46.633
Well, that's why I brought
myself another one.

17:46.699 --> 17:48.601
(LAUGHS)

17:48.668 --> 17:51.003
Jer, I wanted
to pick your brain
on a couple things.

17:51.070 --> 17:52.772
Ask you a few questions.
Kinda sensitive.

17:52.839 --> 17:55.275
Well, anything you
tell me stays here.

17:55.342 --> 17:57.944
Appreciate that. I've been
dating this red-haired gal.

17:58.010 --> 18:00.547
Lives in Jersey. Right outside
the Holland Tunnel.

18:00.613 --> 18:02.415
You know,
when you get out
of the tunnel,

18:02.482 --> 18:03.916
that first quick exit
comes up really fast?
Mmm-hmm.

18:03.983 --> 18:07.354
It's not that one.
It's the one, uh, after it.

18:07.420 --> 18:08.688
He doesn't need to know

18:08.755 --> 18:10.990
where your fake girlfriend
lives, dummy.

18:11.057 --> 18:12.859
Anyway, she wants
to get married,

18:12.925 --> 18:16.529
but after I heard what
happened with your wife...

18:16.596 --> 18:19.199
I just... I hope you
don't mind me asking,

18:19.266 --> 18:23.002
but how do you hide
money from your ex?

18:23.069 --> 18:25.004
Don't mind your asking.

18:25.071 --> 18:27.874
To be honest,
it's smart.

18:27.940 --> 18:30.677
The first thing
I did was...
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

18:30.743 --> 18:32.545
I'm off the fence.
I'm ready to buy.

18:33.746 --> 18:36.883
Crap. What is Kyle
doing there?

18:36.949 --> 18:39.552
No, he's there
to buy some car
made out of meatballs.

18:39.619 --> 18:40.987
Again, Rootger.

18:41.053 --> 18:42.555
Kyle, I'm in the middle of
something right here.

18:42.622 --> 18:44.291
Look, I can't play
the game anymore.

18:44.357 --> 18:46.159
I want the Meatball car.

18:46.226 --> 18:47.994
KEVIN: (SCOFFS)
I'm busy right now, okay?

18:48.060 --> 18:49.462
Hold on a minute.

18:50.597 --> 18:52.332
Did you just say
you're interested

18:52.399 --> 18:54.033
in buying the movie car?

18:54.100 --> 18:55.202
Interested?

18:55.268 --> 18:57.337
Would a man drain
his entire 401(k)

18:57.404 --> 18:58.871
if he was just
"interested"?

18:58.938 --> 19:01.908
(CHUCKLES) Hammer,
that's a special car.

19:01.974 --> 19:04.577
That's why it counts as you
selling two vehicles.

19:04.644 --> 19:07.180
You sell that,
the Vespa's yours.

19:07.247 --> 19:09.382
Really?

19:09.449 --> 19:11.284
Yeah.
So, are we
doing this, bro?

19:11.351 --> 19:12.652
Absolutely.

19:13.853 --> 19:15.054
Wow.

19:15.121 --> 19:16.456
This is fantastic.

19:16.523 --> 19:18.090
What are you...
What are you talking about?

19:18.157 --> 19:19.726
Kyle, he got
the Meatball car.

19:20.927 --> 19:22.195
Whoa. What is this?

19:22.262 --> 19:24.163
One of those fancy Montblancs?

19:28.134 --> 19:29.536
(CAR HORN BLARES)

19:29.602 --> 19:30.703
Pull over!

19:30.770 --> 19:33.240
No! Why can't you
just be happy for me?

19:37.677 --> 19:40.447
Okay, look, I'd like to open
today's team meeting

19:40.513 --> 19:42.315
by saying I'm sorry.

19:42.382 --> 19:45.485
I got carried away,
and I blew the case.

19:46.886 --> 19:48.321
You didn't tell him?

19:49.021 --> 19:50.290
Tell me what?

19:50.357 --> 19:52.225
Oh. Take a look.

19:54.894 --> 19:56.296
My ex is so clueless.

19:56.363 --> 20:00.099
She has no idea
I moved everything
into the Cayman account.

20:00.166 --> 20:02.235
(CHUCKLES)

20:03.570 --> 20:04.604
How'd you get that?

20:04.671 --> 20:06.839
Well, your stupid brother,

20:06.906 --> 20:09.842
uh, left your stupid pen
on Jerry's desk

20:09.909 --> 20:11.244
after he bought his car,

20:11.311 --> 20:14.614
and Jerry
spilled everything.

20:14.681 --> 20:16.849
Security questions,
account numbers.

20:16.916 --> 20:17.950
We got him.

20:18.017 --> 20:19.252
Are you kidding?

20:19.319 --> 20:20.720
That's amazing!

20:20.787 --> 20:24.557
Wow! I guess Kyle's
a lot cooler than I thought.

20:27.059 --> 20:29.195
Beautiful day, ladies.

20:29.262 --> 20:30.663
But it's
about to get cloudy,

20:30.730 --> 20:32.632
with a chance of meatballs.

20:41.207 --> 20:44.277
* Don't want no sweet perfume

20:44.344 --> 20:47.547
* Shake your thing,
go bust your move

20:47.614 --> 20:50.082
* Do, do, do, do, do

20:50.149 --> 20:51.718
* Do, do, do, do

20:51.784 --> 20:54.954
* Oh, yeah

20:55.021 --> 20:58.024
* Don't want
no high-heel shoes

20:58.090 --> 21:00.026
* I just don't want no...
