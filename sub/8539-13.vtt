[gasps]

01:33.658 --> 01:35.356
What do we
have here?

01:35.443 --> 01:37.140
The name's Harry Lashley,
a junior VP with the company.

01:37.227 --> 01:39.664
He's the son-in-law
of the boss, A.P. Caid.

01:39.751 --> 01:41.927
The receptionist, Miss Duane,
over there, forget her phone.

01:42.014 --> 01:43.755
Came back to get it,
found him like this.

01:43.842 --> 01:46.584
Uh, she called security.
Luckily I was working late.

01:46.671 --> 01:48.891
I called 9-1-1 as
soon as I got here.

01:48.978 --> 01:51.502
'I then opened up
Mr. Caid's office to check'

01:51.589 --> 01:54.157
but nothing was amiss.
I-I have an all-access pass.

01:54.244 --> 01:55.854
Well, come on.

01:57.682 --> 01:59.336
Only one thing
was missing

01:59.423 --> 02:02.818
'but it's the most
valuable painting he owns.'

02:02.905 --> 02:05.603
A.P. picked it up at an
auction a couple of months ago.

02:05.690 --> 02:06.952
Paid a little over
$50 million for it.

02:07.039 --> 02:08.432
You said that
these doors were

02:08.519 --> 02:10.260
uh, closed
before you got here?

02:10.347 --> 02:12.610
The office is always locked
up when A.P.'s not here.

02:12.697 --> 02:15.918
'It's a strict rule that
A.P. has when he's gone.'

02:16.005 --> 02:18.138
And Mr. Lashley what would
he have been doing here?

02:18.225 --> 02:20.879
No idea. Uh, his office
is two floors down.

02:20.966 --> 02:23.186
- 'He had no reason to be here'.
- Maybe he was involved.

02:23.273 --> 02:24.709
If we're lucky, we'll
find the murder weapon.

02:24.796 --> 02:26.798
This was obviously
a well-planned robbery.

02:26.885 --> 02:27.799
Why is that
obvious?

02:27.886 --> 02:29.366
Well, nobody
finds themselves

02:29.453 --> 02:31.412
in a locked room
full of old masters

02:31.499 --> 02:33.022
in the middle of the
night by accident, do they?

02:33.109 --> 02:35.851
So well-planned,
but they weren't expecting

02:35.938 --> 02:38.158
to...meet
any opposition.

02:38.245 --> 02:39.811
Otherwise, Mr. Lashley here

02:39.898 --> 02:41.335
would have been
shot or tasered

02:41.422 --> 02:43.902
or tied up
and gagged.

02:43.989 --> 02:45.208
But when they were
surprised by him

02:45.295 --> 02:47.906
they simply hit
him on the head

02:47.993 --> 02:50.779
which suggests an
improvised weapon, yeah?

02:50.866 --> 02:51.780
[camera shutter clicks]

02:51.867 --> 02:52.998

02:53.085 --> 02:55.740
Yes, something like..

02:57.264 --> 02:58.787
[instrumental music]

03:02.617 --> 03:04.880
I predict forensics
will find traces of

03:04.967 --> 03:07.665
Harry Lashley
on this...bust.

03:07.752 --> 03:10.451
No offense, but I used
to be police myself

03:10.538 --> 03:13.584
and that's not police
work, that's...guessing.

03:14.672 --> 03:15.760
[camera shutter clicks]

03:15.847 --> 03:17.980
- Carl, bag this for me.
- Yes, sir.

03:19.982 --> 03:21.157
[camera shutter clicks]

03:21.244 --> 03:22.724
Frank.

03:22.811 --> 03:23.986
Is there a good diner
around here?

03:24.073 --> 03:25.683
Uh, yeah.

03:25.770 --> 03:28.947
Garrity's, a couple of
blocks over on...Madison.

03:29.034 --> 03:31.080
- Do they do good eggs?
- 'I guess.'

03:31.167 --> 03:34.170
That's the test
of a good diner, eggs.

03:34.257 --> 03:36.694
You must have had a contentious
relationship with your father.

03:36.781 --> 03:38.435
Excuse me?
Uh, no.

03:38.522 --> 03:41.351
Tell me, I can't tell
with the hair in her face

03:41.438 --> 03:44.006
and the sobbing,
but, uh, I imagine

03:44.093 --> 03:46.835
Miss Duane is quite
attractive, isn't she?

03:46.922 --> 03:49.577
I mean, receptionists are
often hired for their looks.

03:49.664 --> 03:51.187
What are you
talking about?

03:51.274 --> 03:54.408
- Where are you going with this?
- This way.

03:54.495 --> 03:56.845
Look at the seams.

03:56.932 --> 03:59.021
These shoulder
seams here

03:59.108 --> 04:02.067
had pulled apart and the
way he's lying so straight

04:02.154 --> 04:04.679
like this, and that
shoe that has come off.

04:04.766 --> 04:06.637
No, we all noticed. Somebody
must have dragged him here.

04:06.724 --> 04:08.987
Yes, but dragged
him from where?

04:09.074 --> 04:11.773
And why?

04:11.860 --> 04:14.036
Care to tell us, Frank?

04:14.123 --> 04:15.820
I don't know what
you're talking about.

04:15.907 --> 04:18.562
Oh, alright,
then let me explain.

04:18.649 --> 04:21.826
You and Miss Duane came up here
to have sex in the boss' office.

04:21.913 --> 04:23.567
That's absurd. Why would
I do such a stupid thing?

04:23.654 --> 04:26.570
Well, because it's forbidden,
and thus, very sexy, of course.

04:26.657 --> 04:28.877
Especially if you
have father issues.

04:28.964 --> 04:29.921
And who doesn't?

04:30.008 --> 04:31.532
It's a furtive

04:31.619 --> 04:34.361
but powerful challenge
to the paternal authority.

04:34.448 --> 04:37.146
So you open up
A.P.'s office and then

04:37.233 --> 04:39.191
"Crap! there's a dead
body. What are we gonna do?"

04:39.279 --> 04:41.498
You gotta report it,
but how do you explain

04:41.585 --> 04:44.936
your presence in his office?
A quick but dirty solution.

04:45.023 --> 04:47.287
You drag the body out
and lock the doors back up

04:47.374 --> 04:49.289
before calling the police.

04:49.376 --> 04:50.333
Who is this guy?

04:50.420 --> 04:51.769
He's a pain in the ass

04:51.856 --> 04:53.423
but he's making sense.

04:53.510 --> 04:54.859
You sure you don't want
to change your statement?

04:54.946 --> 04:56.252
No.

04:56.339 --> 04:58.254
Oh, please, Frank,
it'd be silly to deny it.

04:58.341 --> 05:01.649
Five minutes in the room
with the persuasive Agent Cho

05:01.736 --> 05:04.521
and Miss Duane
will tell all.

05:04.608 --> 05:05.827
Back off, man.

05:05.914 --> 05:07.872
[chuckles]
I want to, believe me.

05:07.959 --> 05:09.918
I have zero interest
in your sex life.

05:10.005 --> 05:11.049
But one thing
that occurs to me

05:11.136 --> 05:12.312
a room like this would have

05:12.399 --> 05:13.313
security cameras in it.

05:13.400 --> 05:15.576
- Yeah?
- Yes.

05:15.663 --> 05:18.274
But surely, you wouldn't
knowingly record yourself

05:18.361 --> 05:21.364
making loveon
the boss's carpet.

05:21.451 --> 05:24.454
You'd have to know that the
cameras in the room were off.

05:24.541 --> 05:26.587
Probably because you turned them
off, being the head of security.

05:26.674 --> 05:29.894
They are off,
aren't they, Frank?

05:29.981 --> 05:31.940
So the question
now is, Frank

05:32.027 --> 05:34.159
'how long have they been off
and who else might have known'

05:34.246 --> 05:36.597
they were gonna
be off last night?

05:36.684 --> 05:38.512
You guys can take it from here.
I am starving.

05:38.599 --> 05:39.904
Gotta
get me some eggs.

05:39.991 --> 05:42.211
Garrity's, right?
Thanks.

05:42.298 --> 05:44.126
You ready to tell
us the truth?

05:47.999 --> 05:49.610
[theme music]

05:57.357 --> 05:59.141
Hey, look at this.

05:59.228 --> 06:00.751
It's known as "The Moro"

06:00.838 --> 06:02.579
14th century, Italy.

06:02.666 --> 06:04.712
'It's a portrait of somebody
named "Carlotta Moro".'

06:04.799 --> 06:06.148
It's the only known
works of an artist

06:06.235 --> 06:08.063
known as the
"Siennese master."

06:08.150 --> 06:11.066
It's been owned by two popes,
the king of France

06:11.153 --> 06:12.981
and John Jacob Astor,
among others.

06:13.068 --> 06:15.331
But A.P. Caid bought it
for $50 million, 3 months ago.

06:15.418 --> 06:16.376
[whistles]

06:16.463 --> 06:17.942
What do we
know about Caid?

06:18.029 --> 06:21.206
Apart from he's an idiot
with his money?

06:21.293 --> 06:23.121
Like the cover says.

06:23.208 --> 06:25.341
'He got his start as a
roughneck in the oil fields.'

06:25.428 --> 06:27.474
And turned into a wildcatter
and made a fortune by the time

06:27.561 --> 06:30.564
he was 30. He's a tough guy.
His trick's pulling oil

06:30.651 --> 06:32.130
out of places nobody
else has the balls to go.

06:32.217 --> 06:34.437
- Where is he now?
- He's somewhere on a sailboat.

06:34.524 --> 06:36.134
He's been told what's going on.
He's coming back as quick as

06:36.221 --> 06:38.180
he can. I was thinking,
it would have been easy

06:38.267 --> 06:39.790
for him to sail up or
down the coast a few miles

06:39.877 --> 06:41.488
'put into a small
marina and come back'

06:41.575 --> 06:43.359
'and commit the crime without
anybody else knowing.'

06:43.446 --> 06:45.666
- Why would he wanna do that?
- I'm just saying he could.

06:45.753 --> 06:47.624
Maybe he wants the insurance
money or he wants to get rid

06:47.711 --> 06:49.713
of Harry. Doesn't like that
he's married to his daughter.

06:49.800 --> 06:51.236
Did you check with
Caid's security team?

06:51.323 --> 06:53.108
Everybody at the company
that didn't wear a suit

06:53.195 --> 06:55.502
knew all about Frank Schiappa
and his use of A.P.'s office.

06:55.589 --> 06:56.677
Any number of people might
have known

06:56.764 --> 06:57.765
the cameras were off last night.

06:57.852 --> 06:59.027
Sounds like we're gonna
have to

06:59.114 --> 07:01.812
check out
any number of people.

07:01.899 --> 07:04.424
- 'Where's Jane?'
- I don't know.

07:04.511 --> 07:07.905
Well, find him. I'm gonna go
and talk to Lashley's wife.

07:07.992 --> 07:10.560
You guys give Caid's personnel
files a good hard look.

07:10.647 --> 07:12.823
See if there's
any criminal connections.

07:12.910 --> 07:15.086
- Especially Harry Lashley.
- Do you think he's dirty?

07:15.173 --> 07:17.393
Well, he's involved.
Why else would he be there

07:17.480 --> 07:18.873
in the middle
of the night?

07:22.746 --> 07:24.356
'It doesn't feel real.'

07:24.444 --> 07:25.967
If it wasn't
for you people

07:26.054 --> 07:27.403
I wouldn't believe it.

07:27.490 --> 07:29.187
Harry is going to
walk through the door

07:29.274 --> 07:31.799
and this is all
just a strange dream.

07:31.886 --> 07:34.279
But here you are.
Harry's dead.

07:34.366 --> 07:36.543
'When was the last
time you spoke to him?'

07:36.630 --> 07:38.327
Yesterday afternoon.

07:38.414 --> 07:40.938
Just chitchat,
where to go for dinner.

07:41.025 --> 07:44.159
Then he left me a message
cancelling, didn't say why.

07:44.246 --> 07:47.162
That wasn't unusual, cancelling
without giving any reason?

07:47.249 --> 07:50.731
No. Harry was very
hardworking, very keen.

07:50.818 --> 07:54.038
Stuff would come up
all the time.

07:54.125 --> 07:55.823
What was his
job here exactly?

07:55.910 --> 07:58.129
[scoffs]
Good question.

07:58.216 --> 08:00.697
He was a sort of
jack-of-all-trades

08:00.784 --> 08:02.220
'for my father.'

08:02.307 --> 08:04.571
'Did whatever he needed
from week to week.'

08:04.658 --> 08:06.529
My father liked
having someone on hand

08:06.616 --> 08:09.358
with no ties or friendships
within the company.

08:09.445 --> 08:11.316
That's a tough assignment.

08:11.403 --> 08:13.014
Yes.

08:13.101 --> 08:16.321
But he only joined the
company when we were married.

08:16.408 --> 08:19.194
He was...learning the ropes.

08:19.281 --> 08:21.196
Your father didn't want
Harry to have a soft ride

08:21.283 --> 08:22.719
just 'cause he
was your husband.

08:22.806 --> 08:25.243
Yes, you could put
it like that.

08:25.330 --> 08:26.767
What was his
previous employment?

08:26.854 --> 08:29.073
He was a musician.

08:29.160 --> 08:30.205
Jazz guitarist.

08:30.292 --> 08:32.642
Yes. How did you
know that?

08:32.729 --> 08:35.123
I looked at his fingers.
Guitarist fingers.

08:35.210 --> 08:37.691
Jazz with a flamenco edge

08:37.778 --> 08:39.519
judging by the
ridge on his thumb.

08:39.606 --> 08:40.520
Yes.

08:40.607 --> 08:41.521
He was playing a gig

08:41.608 --> 08:43.218
at one of these ghastly, uh

08:43.305 --> 08:45.002
events you have to go to

08:45.089 --> 08:47.091
and you struck up
a conversation.

08:47.178 --> 08:50.094
You love jazz, so you
could talk with him easily

08:50.181 --> 08:52.270
which, uh, normally is
quite difficult for you

08:52.357 --> 08:54.577
'outside of business.'

08:54.664 --> 08:58.059
I, uh, yes, that's--

08:58.146 --> 09:01.715
I'm sorry, Ms. Caid.
He's just showing off.

09:01.802 --> 09:04.631
Can-can you think of any
reason why harry would have been

09:04.718 --> 09:07.459
on this floor at
that time of night?

09:07.547 --> 09:10.767
Uh, no. Uh, he
would have known

09:10.854 --> 09:12.943
that neither I nor
my father were here.

09:13.030 --> 09:14.466
So?

09:14.554 --> 09:16.381
I understand
from my assistant

09:16.468 --> 09:17.905
that Frank Schiappa's
misbehavior

09:17.992 --> 09:20.560
was an open secret
amongst the junior staff.

09:20.647 --> 09:22.344
He's no longer
a Caid employee.

09:22.431 --> 09:23.780
Hmm.

09:23.867 --> 09:26.609
Perhaps...Harry
had found out

09:26.696 --> 09:28.916
and he was trying
to catch him.

09:29.003 --> 09:30.526
Perhaps.

09:30.613 --> 09:32.833
'Or is it possible that
he had prior knowledge'

09:32.920 --> 09:35.052
'that the theft was
gonna take place?'

09:35.139 --> 09:37.533
You're asking if he could have
been complicit in the theft?

09:37.620 --> 09:38.708
Yes, I am.

09:38.795 --> 09:40.144
No.

09:40.231 --> 09:42.407
He was honest and gentle.

09:42.494 --> 09:44.018
No.

09:44.105 --> 09:46.411
So he never talked to
you about the painting?

09:46.498 --> 09:49.937
No. I didn't approve
of buying it.

09:50.024 --> 09:51.982
$50 million
is far too much money

09:52.069 --> 09:54.115
to spend on
a single object.

09:54.202 --> 09:59.294
When it comes to art, rational
arguments don't apply for him.

09:59.381 --> 10:01.731
That would be Kathryn Hawkes'
area of expertise.

10:01.818 --> 10:04.168
Kathryn Hawkes?
She is..

10:04.255 --> 10:07.128
She buys the art for
my father's collection.

10:09.130 --> 10:11.306
It's a terrible
tragedy, terrible.

10:11.393 --> 10:12.829
Did you know Mr. Lashley?

10:12.916 --> 10:15.092
Not well. I mean,
I knew of him, obviously.

10:15.179 --> 10:18.618
But, uh, poor man.
It's very sad.

10:18.705 --> 10:20.010
But you think the
loss of the painting

10:20.097 --> 10:21.316
is the real
tragedy here.

10:21.403 --> 10:22.883
Well, no.

10:22.970 --> 10:25.973
Every human life
is a sacred thing.

10:26.060 --> 10:28.845
But "The Moro" is a
uniquely beautiful treasure

10:28.932 --> 10:30.194
beyond precious.

10:30.281 --> 10:31.935
You know the
art market.

10:32.022 --> 10:34.851
Who would be willing and able
to steal such a high-end piece?

10:34.938 --> 10:37.462
Worldwide, there's probably
a good hundred collectors

10:37.549 --> 10:40.248
with the resources and passion
enough to do something like this

10:40.335 --> 10:44.078
but it's public knowledge
that Mr. Caid outbid

10:44.165 --> 10:46.210
Shirali Arlov
to get the "The Moro."

10:46.297 --> 10:47.864
Mr. Arlov is
not pleased.

10:47.951 --> 10:50.301
Shirali Arlov,
the Russian oil baron?

10:50.388 --> 10:51.520
Him.

10:54.175 --> 10:55.959
Arlov is
a nasty piece of work.

10:56.046 --> 10:57.482
He has a legit front
as an oilman

10:57.569 --> 11:00.181
'but he's a super rich
gangster, basically.'

11:00.268 --> 11:02.270
They say he likes his business
rivals to be delivered to him

11:02.357 --> 11:04.881
hog-tied and naked
so he can kill 'em personally.

11:04.968 --> 11:07.144
'Vicious, greedy
and the owner'

11:07.231 --> 11:09.494
of the finest collection of
renaissance paintings in Russia.

11:09.581 --> 11:11.018
Sounds likes our kinda guy.

11:11.105 --> 11:12.802
Talk to the organized
crime boys upstairs.

11:12.889 --> 11:15.326
Find out who Arlov's
connections are in California.

11:15.413 --> 11:18.155
Who he'd use for a job like this
and where they were last night.

11:18.242 --> 11:20.984
- You got it, boss.
- What do you have?

11:21.071 --> 11:24.335
Harry Lashley has a past.
Ten years ago in Canada

11:24.422 --> 11:27.208
he stole cash from a video
store he was working at.

11:27.295 --> 11:28.905
Busted and served
six months.

11:28.992 --> 11:30.951
Damn, I was hoping
he was clean.

11:31.038 --> 11:33.344
Yeah, I know. Then I tried to
find any connection he had

11:33.431 --> 11:36.478
with the art world,
and this popped up.

11:36.565 --> 11:39.699
'A month ago, he paid a company
called R.W. Arts $20,000.'

11:39.786 --> 11:41.309
That's pretty much the
only financial transaction

11:41.396 --> 11:42.876
he's made recently.

11:42.963 --> 11:44.791
- What's R.W. Arts?
- I don't know yet.

11:44.878 --> 11:46.618
Shell, probably.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.751
The address is just a
mailbox in Lockesdale

11:48.838 --> 11:49.883
a little farming
town up north.

11:49.970 --> 11:51.232
Hmm. That's interesting.

11:51.319 --> 11:52.755
Uh, let's Van Pelt and I go up

11:52.842 --> 11:55.279
and take a look-see.

11:55.366 --> 11:57.020
You and Van Pelt?

11:57.107 --> 12:00.197
Mm. Well, she's from a small
farming town. Aren't you?

12:00.284 --> 12:01.459
Yes, I am.

12:01.546 --> 12:03.244
Right. Well, that's what
you guys call

12:03.331 --> 12:06.377
uh, what is it? Cover.

12:06.464 --> 12:09.859
What do you need cover for?
You're a CBI operative.

12:09.946 --> 12:13.515
Uh, I thought
I was a "consultant."

12:13.602 --> 12:16.561
Just follow procedure.
Have fun.

12:16.648 --> 12:19.347
Where's the fun in that?

12:19.434 --> 12:20.609
Shall we?

12:23.394 --> 12:24.700
[theme music]

12:36.756 --> 12:38.366
[indistinct noise]

12:46.983 --> 12:50.247
How cute is this?

12:50.334 --> 12:52.380
It sure doesn't look like the
lair of high-end art thieves.

12:52.467 --> 12:55.339
Not at all.
Flowers and fruit.

12:58.255 --> 13:01.171
"Rob Wallace
gallery and framing."

13:01.258 --> 13:02.216
Bingo.

13:04.044 --> 13:05.828
Uh, let's not start
with the badge.

13:05.915 --> 13:07.351
Let's just get
the lay of the land first

13:07.438 --> 13:09.310
then we use the
badge if we have to.

13:09.397 --> 13:11.965
Well, okay.

13:12.052 --> 13:14.532
- But don'tembarrass me.
- What do you mean?

13:14.619 --> 13:17.492
- You know what I mean.
- No. What do you mean?

13:17.579 --> 13:19.276
[door creaks]

13:20.408 --> 13:21.496
Morning, folks.

13:21.583 --> 13:23.237
Hi.

13:23.324 --> 13:25.326
Look around,
make yourself at home.

13:25.413 --> 13:27.197
Will do.

13:43.300 --> 13:44.824
- Hi.
- Hi.

13:47.348 --> 13:50.786
- I know what you're thinking.
- You do?

13:50.873 --> 13:54.224
You're thinking my fiancée
is a lot younger than me.

13:54.311 --> 13:56.313
[laughs]
Oh, no.

13:56.400 --> 14:00.013
Well, she is. I'll let
you in on a little secret.

14:00.100 --> 14:03.146
I was her college
professor...seduced her.

14:05.801 --> 14:07.281
- You're kidding.
- Mm-hmm.

14:07.368 --> 14:09.326
Her parents hated it.
A lot of drama.

14:09.413 --> 14:11.111
Totally worth it,
though. Right, babe?

14:11.198 --> 14:14.070
Okay, that's what I mean.
Come on. Stop it.

14:14.157 --> 14:15.942
Oh, that's good.
He's good.

14:19.206 --> 14:21.382
Huh, wow!

14:21.469 --> 14:22.862
Do you think you could do
a portrait of my fiancée?

14:22.949 --> 14:24.037
- No.
- Yeah?

14:24.124 --> 14:25.386
- Yeah, you bet.
- No.

14:25.473 --> 14:27.257
Who's the boss
in this relationship?

14:27.344 --> 14:30.608
Um. He's just
playing the fool.

14:30.695 --> 14:32.349
Stop it now.

14:32.436 --> 14:33.873
[funk music]

14:39.356 --> 14:42.751
Okay, turn just a little
to your left. There.

14:42.838 --> 14:43.970
Good.

14:47.669 --> 14:50.890
Looks good.

14:50.977 --> 14:52.413
Uh, just-just make
sure you don't

14:52.500 --> 14:53.893
do her eyes too
close together.

14:56.069 --> 14:58.854
Um...um..

14:58.941 --> 15:01.117
I'm sorry. I'm-I'm
getting in your space.

15:01.204 --> 15:03.380
Uh, where's
your facilities?

15:03.467 --> 15:04.904
Down the hall,
door on the right.

15:04.991 --> 15:07.515
Okay, alright.
Okay.

15:07.602 --> 15:09.212
Just not too
close, you know?

15:09.299 --> 15:10.474
'You know, what I'm saying?'

15:14.870 --> 15:16.263
Yeah.

15:18.308 --> 15:19.919
[intense music]

15:24.184 --> 15:26.534
Just, uh, passing
through town, are you?

15:26.621 --> 15:29.319
Yes, uh, just
passing through.

15:33.541 --> 15:34.498
[door creaks]

15:39.547 --> 15:40.548
[floorboard creaks]

15:44.334 --> 15:46.815
- 'You have an excellent nose.'
- Thank you.

15:49.992 --> 15:51.385
[intense music]

15:59.697 --> 16:00.655
[door creaks]

16:02.004 --> 16:03.919
How long have you
lived here?

16:04.006 --> 16:05.094
All my life.

16:11.013 --> 16:12.058
[door creaks]

16:21.458 --> 16:23.373
Do you mind if I ask you
a personal question?

16:23.460 --> 16:25.549
That depends, I suppose.

16:25.636 --> 16:27.725
Uh, go ahead.

16:27.812 --> 16:29.336
How long have you and
Patrick been together?

16:29.423 --> 16:32.382
Um, not long.

16:32.469 --> 16:33.993
[chuckles]
Okay, I'm just
gonna say it.

16:34.080 --> 16:35.777
'Are you sure about
marrying this guy?'

16:35.864 --> 16:39.955
I mean, he kinda appears to
be a jerk. I mean, no offense.

16:40.042 --> 16:42.871
Oh, no. Yes.
I-I'm not marrying him.

16:42.958 --> 16:44.481
That's...no.

16:44.568 --> 16:47.397
[chuckles]
Don't worry about that.
Not gonna happen.

16:50.661 --> 16:51.836
[door creaks]

16:53.795 --> 16:54.752
[metal clacking]

16:57.886 --> 16:58.887
[laughs]

17:01.803 --> 17:02.891
[door creaks]

17:09.593 --> 17:11.117
Hello.

17:11.204 --> 17:14.250
'Turn your head just
to the left a little bit.'

17:14.337 --> 17:15.556
'Just a little bit more.'

17:15.643 --> 17:18.080
A little bit more
to your left.

17:18.167 --> 17:21.736
Just, uh, that's great.
Hold that, okay?

17:21.823 --> 17:24.739
Look down.
Hold that.

17:24.826 --> 17:27.568
This way, I'm gonna have
a lot of light on your..

17:27.655 --> 17:28.569
'...cheekbones.'

17:30.919 --> 17:34.749
You're gonna be so amazed
with how good this looks..

17:34.836 --> 17:36.229
...the facial structure.

17:39.362 --> 17:40.363
Okay.

17:40.450 --> 17:41.451
Stand up.

17:45.934 --> 17:47.849
[intense music]

17:57.032 --> 17:59.513
Put your hands
in the air.

17:59.600 --> 18:00.905
Okay.

18:03.560 --> 18:04.953
Move. Move!

18:05.040 --> 18:05.997
Steady.

18:06.085 --> 18:07.129
Steady.

18:09.566 --> 18:12.743
Mr. Wallace, if you'd
just let me show you my badge

18:12.830 --> 18:15.529
we're from the California
Bureau of Investigation.

18:15.616 --> 18:16.834
Our office knows
we're here.

18:16.921 --> 18:19.141
If you kill us,
they'll know who did it.

18:19.228 --> 18:21.187
Kill you? Why would I
wanna kill you?

18:21.274 --> 18:22.231
You're cops?

18:22.318 --> 18:23.363
Well, she..

18:25.539 --> 18:28.107
We're investigating
the murder of Harry Lashley.

18:28.194 --> 18:29.325
Lashley's dead?

18:32.981 --> 18:34.374
What happened? I..

18:34.461 --> 18:36.115
We were hoping you might
be able to tell us that.

18:36.202 --> 18:37.725
Considering you have
the stolen painting.

18:37.812 --> 18:39.857
Uh, no,
that's-that's a copy.

18:39.944 --> 18:43.774
Mr. Wallace here
is, uh, an art forger

18:43.861 --> 18:45.820
very-very good one,
by the way.

18:45.907 --> 18:50.346
Um, that's a copy.
He's...not a thief.

18:50.433 --> 18:52.131
- Well, give me the shotgun.
- Yeah.

18:52.218 --> 18:53.132
Oh.

18:59.442 --> 19:01.227
Mr. Lashley came to me
a couple of months ago

19:01.314 --> 19:04.534
and commissioned two
copies of "The Moro."

19:04.621 --> 19:06.406
How did he find you?

19:06.493 --> 19:09.148
People who need my services
tend to find me eventually.

19:11.976 --> 19:13.804
It's not a crime,
what I do.

19:13.891 --> 19:15.676
If you have a valuable
painting, it's only sensible

19:15.763 --> 19:17.504
to have a copy made
for the display.

19:17.591 --> 19:20.289
That way,
the real thing's safe.

19:20.376 --> 19:22.726
He picked up the copies
about a month ago.

19:22.813 --> 19:25.816
So you gave him
two copies already?

19:25.903 --> 19:27.383
What's this one for?

19:27.470 --> 19:30.647
This one I did for myself.

19:30.734 --> 19:34.347
It's a beautiful picture.
I'd come to love her.

19:34.434 --> 19:36.044
Why did he
want two copies?

19:36.131 --> 19:38.264
- He didn't say.
- And you didn't ask questions.

19:40.309 --> 19:42.137
He paid me $10,000
for each of them

19:42.224 --> 19:44.270
so no, I didn't ask
any questions.

19:44.357 --> 19:46.272
Hmm.

19:46.359 --> 19:48.274
How do we know this
isn't the real thing?

19:48.361 --> 19:50.450
I'm not a forger.
I'm an artist.

19:50.537 --> 19:52.626
I'm not trying
to trick anyone.

19:52.713 --> 19:54.715
Okay? I always added
detail that ensures

19:54.802 --> 19:57.239
that nobody can sell my work
as the genuine article.

19:57.326 --> 19:58.588
That's very ethical of you.

20:00.503 --> 20:02.026
It looks pretty much
exactly the same to me.

20:02.113 --> 20:03.506
No, he's telling
the truth.

20:03.593 --> 20:04.725
Take a closer look.

20:09.033 --> 20:10.513
What am I looking for?

20:10.600 --> 20:13.037
Closer.

20:13.124 --> 20:16.737
Um. Oh, I still don't..

20:16.824 --> 20:18.042
You're getting warmer.

20:18.129 --> 20:19.740
'Huh?'

20:19.827 --> 20:21.698
[gasps]
Oh!

20:21.785 --> 20:22.699
'A TV aerial.'

20:24.310 --> 20:25.876
- Yes.
- They didn't have TV.

20:25.963 --> 20:29.053
No.Beautiful work.

20:29.140 --> 20:31.142
May I borrow it for a while?

20:31.230 --> 20:32.405
Uh, I don't know
about that.

20:32.492 --> 20:33.754
How-how do I know
I'm gonna get it back?

20:33.841 --> 20:37.192
Uh, let me put
it another way.

20:37.279 --> 20:39.063
Lend it to me
or Agent Van Pelt here

20:39.150 --> 20:41.240
will take you and the
painting back to Sacramento

20:41.327 --> 20:44.417
and keep you there and ask
you mind-numbing questions

20:44.504 --> 20:46.375
for hours and hours on end.

20:48.856 --> 20:49.857
Thank you.

20:51.380 --> 20:52.947
'Copies, huh? Clever.'

20:53.034 --> 20:55.297
Harry and his accomplices
steal the painting once

20:55.384 --> 20:56.820
but they get to sell
it three times.

20:56.907 --> 20:58.735
'Hey, boss.'

20:58.822 --> 21:00.302
A.P. Caid's back
from his trip.

21:00.389 --> 21:02.261
He's on his way
back to his office.

21:08.092 --> 21:10.181
No, no, no. You got
it all wrong, see..

21:10.269 --> 21:13.184
I told Harry to get a copy
made on the hush-hush.

21:13.272 --> 21:15.796
I mean, what kind of idiot
is gonna put $50 million

21:15.883 --> 21:18.189
on his wall so anybody
can steal it, huh?

21:18.277 --> 21:20.453
So the painting that
was stolen is a fake?

21:20.540 --> 21:22.977
[laughs]
Damn right, it was.

21:23.064 --> 21:25.371
Now the real one is
in my...private vault.

21:25.458 --> 21:28.678
With all due respect, A.P., the
art here is my responsibility.

21:28.765 --> 21:30.854
Kathryn, the fewer people
who knew, the better.

21:30.941 --> 21:33.204
Besides, it paid off,
didn't it, huh?

21:33.292 --> 21:35.424
I mean, right now, there's
some...thieving son of a bitch

21:35.511 --> 21:38.384
out there who spent a
whole lot of money on junk.

21:38.471 --> 21:40.951
Daddy, Harry's dead.

21:41.038 --> 21:43.258
Oh, baby, I know.
I'm sorry.

21:43.345 --> 21:47.088
I know. It's too sad, but, uh,
you know, I did like that kid.

21:47.175 --> 21:48.655
Can we see the painting?

21:48.742 --> 21:49.786
You wanna see my baby?

21:49.873 --> 21:51.745
[chuckles]
I'll open the vault.

21:54.878 --> 21:56.837
[whistles]

21:56.924 --> 21:58.578
Ain't she a beauty?

21:58.665 --> 22:02.364
- You, uh, mind if I take a--
- No. Oh, yeah, yeah.

22:02.451 --> 22:04.671
[Kathryn]
'A masterpiece of
Quattrocento portraiture.'

22:04.758 --> 22:07.891
- One of a kind.
- $50 million right there.

22:07.978 --> 22:11.591
It's about $10,000
right there. It's a fake.

22:11.678 --> 22:12.722
The hell it is.

22:12.809 --> 22:14.811
Fake as a $6 bill.

22:14.898 --> 22:16.291
That's not funny, son.

22:16.378 --> 22:18.337
Take a look back
here by the trees

22:18.424 --> 22:21.035
the guys on horseback.

22:21.122 --> 22:23.559
'The third one in from the
left, next to the footmen--'

22:23.646 --> 22:25.431
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I see the horses, what?

22:25.518 --> 22:28.608
'What do you think, is that
an M16 or a Kalashnikov?'

22:28.695 --> 22:29.870
Son of a bitch.

22:29.957 --> 22:31.741
Yeah, I think it's
a Kalashnikov.

22:31.828 --> 22:35.049
Son of a bitch. There's-there's
a machine gun in my painting.

22:35.136 --> 22:37.704
How in the hell could
you not notice that?

22:37.791 --> 22:39.401
Huh? If this bozo here
can see it, why couldn't you?

22:39.488 --> 22:40.837
A.P., I can assure you.

22:40.924 --> 22:42.665
- No, no, no, no.
- The painting--

22:42.752 --> 22:45.364
You're the one who has the good
eye. No, you brought me a fake.

22:45.451 --> 22:48.323
Mr. Caid, I can state
with absolute certainty

22:48.410 --> 22:51.457
the painting which I purchased
for you and placed in your hands

22:51.544 --> 22:52.719
was genuine.

22:52.806 --> 22:54.938
I have the documents
to prove it.

22:55.025 --> 22:58.028
'If you chose to engage
in some clever subterfuge'

22:58.115 --> 22:59.595
without my knowledge

22:59.682 --> 23:03.991
I can hardly be
blamed for the results.

23:04.078 --> 23:05.993
- Excuse me.
- Harry.

23:06.080 --> 23:07.690
That son of
a bitch, Harry.

23:07.777 --> 23:10.519
He switched out...the real
painting for the fake one.

23:10.606 --> 23:11.868
And then bludgeoned
himself to death

23:11.955 --> 23:13.479
I suppose? You have
no basis for that.

23:13.566 --> 23:14.784
That was probably
one of his crackhead

23:14.871 --> 23:16.395
musician friends
he brought along.

23:16.482 --> 23:18.571
You don't know that.
That's not fair.

23:18.658 --> 23:21.269
Were you aware
he spent time in prison?

23:21.356 --> 23:23.880
Six months for theft
in Canada, ten years ago.

23:23.967 --> 23:25.926
[scoffs]
Huh.

23:26.013 --> 23:27.971
Yes.

23:28.058 --> 23:29.320
I mean, no, I didn't.

23:29.408 --> 23:32.585
'Um-m, I-I'm sure it doesn't..'

23:32.672 --> 23:35.457
Yeah, I'm sure it's not.
It was ten years ago.

23:35.544 --> 23:37.503
I knew it.

23:37.590 --> 23:40.288
I knew it. This guy
was no good for you.

23:40.375 --> 23:42.116
I could feel it.

23:42.203 --> 23:43.160
But I kept
quiet, didn't I?

23:43.247 --> 23:44.640
For your sake.

23:44.727 --> 23:47.600
'I forced myself
to trust this guy.'

23:47.687 --> 23:50.167
Because you finally
had yourself a man.

23:50.254 --> 23:52.039
'He stole $50 million from me.'

23:53.736 --> 23:56.696
Damn it, Stevie.

23:56.783 --> 23:59.002
Please, I beg you.

23:59.089 --> 24:01.614
Find my husband's murderer.

24:01.701 --> 24:03.703
That's what we're
trying to do, ma'am.

24:03.790 --> 24:05.966
[weeps]
They'll tell you the truth.

24:06.053 --> 24:07.533
I want the truth.

24:13.190 --> 24:16.237
You can go now.

24:16.324 --> 24:18.108
That's all we need
at the moment.

24:18.195 --> 24:19.980
We'll be in touch.

24:20.067 --> 24:21.982
Right.

24:22.069 --> 24:23.331
[clears throat]

24:23.418 --> 24:25.725
Uh, I hate to be
blunt, Mr. Caid.

24:25.812 --> 24:28.075
- But you're just--
- Let's...no, no, you don't.

24:28.162 --> 24:30.425
Well, we'll talk later.

24:30.512 --> 24:32.862
Harry has copies made, but he
doesn't hang one on the wall

24:32.949 --> 24:34.560
to disguise the robbery, why?

24:34.647 --> 24:36.344
'Cause it was part of
the plan. Everyone has to know

24:36.431 --> 24:38.346
the painting was stolen for him
to have anything to sell.

24:38.433 --> 24:40.087
The painting has to be missing.

24:40.174 --> 24:42.350
So he makes the switch, goes
to steal the real painting

24:42.437 --> 24:44.265
off the wall,
knowing frisky Frank

24:44.352 --> 24:46.528
has turned the cameras off.

24:46.615 --> 24:48.051
So who kills him then?

24:48.138 --> 24:50.489
Whoever ended up delivering
the painting to a buyer.

24:50.576 --> 24:52.360
Harry outlived his usefulness
the minute he used his

24:52.447 --> 24:55.276
security pass to get
into A.P.'s office.

24:55.363 --> 24:57.452
Well, we just heard from
the organized crime boys

24:57.539 --> 24:58.801
about Shirali Arlov.

24:58.888 --> 24:59.802
- We did?
- 'Yeah.'

24:59.889 --> 25:00.847
The good news is

25:00.934 --> 25:02.283
he's in California, L.A.

25:02.370 --> 25:03.893
'He arrived a
couple of days ago.'

25:03.980 --> 25:05.286
Well, that can't
be a coincidence.

25:05.373 --> 25:06.417
And what's the bad news?

25:06.505 --> 25:07.723
The bad news is he's traveling

25:07.810 --> 25:09.769
on a diplomatic passport.

25:09.856 --> 25:11.814
'We cannot touch him
under any circumstances.'

25:11.901 --> 25:13.381
Just ask him
a couple questions--

25:13.468 --> 25:16.776
State department was
crystal clear...keep away.

25:16.863 --> 25:19.430
Arlov controls an oil pipeline
route this country needs.

25:19.518 --> 25:20.997
It's a national security issue.

25:21.084 --> 25:23.478
Another argument for
energy independence there.

25:23.565 --> 25:24.914
Where's he staying?

25:25.001 --> 25:27.656
I repeat, do not touch.

25:27.743 --> 25:28.962
Oh, no, no.

25:29.049 --> 25:30.529
No touching.

25:30.616 --> 25:33.357
I promise.

25:33.444 --> 25:35.272
[techno music]

26:09.655 --> 26:10.786
Nope, nyet,no,
and Minelli says no, too.

26:10.873 --> 26:12.092
That's four nos.

26:12.179 --> 26:13.484
Minelli always says no.
It's his job.

26:13.572 --> 26:15.138
And it's my job
to listen to him.

26:15.225 --> 26:16.792
You'd walk away?

26:16.879 --> 26:20.535
If Arlov is our man, you'd let
him get away with murder?

26:20.622 --> 26:22.189
'He didn't do the murder.'

26:22.276 --> 26:24.060
He probably bought the
painting from the murderer.

26:24.147 --> 26:25.627
We'll never know unless
we go talk to him.

26:25.714 --> 26:27.455
We're gonna close this
case but not by causing

26:27.542 --> 26:28.456
an international scandal.

26:28.543 --> 26:29.805
Arlov's the key.

26:29.892 --> 26:31.894
I want to get
Harry Lashley's killer

26:31.981 --> 26:33.940
as much as you do but we cannot

26:34.027 --> 26:35.637
go after Arlov.
The state department--

26:35.724 --> 26:38.901
- A fig to the state department.
- Yeah, I agree. Screw 'em.

26:38.988 --> 26:41.687
That attitude is why I'm
in charge and you guys aren't.

26:41.774 --> 26:44.515
And would you please leave some
of those for everybody else?

26:44.603 --> 26:45.734
They're so small.

26:48.302 --> 26:50.478
[sighs]

26:50.565 --> 26:53.437
I just...don't understand
why a law officer

26:53.524 --> 26:56.571
can't go after
a known criminal.

26:56.658 --> 26:58.181
Man, damn right.

27:00.793 --> 27:02.925
If we left now, we
could be in L.A. before dark.

27:03.012 --> 27:03.970
What?

27:04.057 --> 27:05.319
Tell Cho to meet us

27:05.406 --> 27:06.276
in the parking lot
in ten minutes.

27:06.363 --> 27:07.364
Uh..

27:12.543 --> 27:14.197
[instrumental music]

27:21.988 --> 27:23.598
[cell phone rings]

27:27.646 --> 27:29.996
- Hello.
- You ready?

27:30.083 --> 27:31.780
- Yeah.
- Are youready?

27:31.867 --> 27:34.000
I'm ready.
What's the signal?

27:34.087 --> 27:35.349
"She is beautiful."

27:35.436 --> 27:37.220
Good.

27:37.307 --> 27:38.482
Let's do this.

27:42.878 --> 27:43.923
[thud]

27:49.319 --> 27:51.191
[singing in foreign language]

27:54.150 --> 27:55.108
[rings doorbell]

28:03.899 --> 28:05.335
[indistinct chatter]

28:11.559 --> 28:12.691
Hi.

28:12.778 --> 28:13.996
Uh, could you tell

28:14.083 --> 28:17.521
Mr. Arlov, Patrick Jane is here?

28:17.608 --> 28:20.786
I have "The Moro" portrait that
was stolen a couple days ago.

28:20.873 --> 28:22.701
I'd like to sell it to him.

28:43.286 --> 28:44.505
What?

28:47.421 --> 28:49.205
Let him come in.

28:53.993 --> 28:54.907
Thank you.

28:59.738 --> 29:00.782
Good evening.

29:03.916 --> 29:04.830
Please sit.

29:15.188 --> 29:17.843
"World's Best Collisions"
you know this show?

29:17.930 --> 29:19.453
- No.
- Oh, you should check it out.

29:19.540 --> 29:23.979
It's, uh, it's very amusing
and, uh, educational.

29:24.066 --> 29:25.981
It's a lesson for us all.

29:26.068 --> 29:27.287
Anytime, anyplace

29:27.374 --> 29:29.419
boom!

29:29.506 --> 29:31.160
Your life can be over.

29:31.247 --> 29:34.076
- That's very true.
- Mm-hmm.

29:34.163 --> 29:35.861
Would you like
a drink, a snack?

29:35.948 --> 29:39.342
Uh, yes.
Um, sparkling water.

29:39.429 --> 29:40.387
Please.

29:42.345 --> 29:45.087
No ice, room temperature.

29:45.174 --> 29:47.046
[Jane]
'Oh, and in a
tall glass please.'

29:51.877 --> 29:52.921
[keys clacking]

29:55.924 --> 29:57.317
Where is everyone?

29:57.404 --> 29:59.319
Weird. They all
called in to sign out.

29:59.406 --> 30:01.712
Jane wasn't feeling well,
Rigsby's got a hot date

30:01.800 --> 30:03.323
and Cho got kings tickets.

30:03.410 --> 30:04.628
- Son of a--
- What?

30:04.715 --> 30:05.847
Jane doesn't get sick.

30:05.934 --> 30:06.892
Rigsby's not on a date

30:06.979 --> 30:08.154
because he's in love with you

30:08.241 --> 30:09.372
'and the Kings
aren't playing tonight.'

30:09.459 --> 30:10.504
- You know about that?
- Yeah.

30:10.591 --> 30:11.984
They're on
an east coast road trip.

30:12.071 --> 30:13.333
They're playing the
Knicks tomorrow night.

30:13.420 --> 30:14.334
No, I mean, about Rigsby.

30:14.421 --> 30:15.335
How do you know about that?

30:15.422 --> 30:16.379
Everybody knows that.

30:16.466 --> 30:17.554
The attorney general knows that.

30:17.641 --> 30:19.208
[sighs]
I'm so embarrassed.

30:19.295 --> 30:20.644
Please.

30:20.731 --> 30:22.864
[cell phone ringing]

30:22.951 --> 30:24.518
Pick up the phone, damn it.

30:25.606 --> 30:26.955
[instrumental music]

30:28.827 --> 30:29.871
Thank you.

30:36.399 --> 30:38.619
So.

30:38.706 --> 30:41.361
[clears throat]

30:41.448 --> 30:45.582
Mr. Patrick Jane.

30:45.669 --> 30:48.368
You have a painting
you want to sell me?

30:48.455 --> 30:50.544
"The Carlotta Moro"?

30:50.631 --> 30:52.328
Yes.

30:52.415 --> 30:53.721
I don't believe you.

30:53.808 --> 30:56.593
Would you like
to take a look?

30:56.680 --> 30:58.247
Sure.

31:08.214 --> 31:09.215
[dramatic music]

31:13.959 --> 31:15.482
[chuckles]

31:15.569 --> 31:16.918
Are you mad?

31:17.005 --> 31:19.094
No, I'm just kidding.
Kidding.

31:19.181 --> 31:21.488
'It's just a prop
to get me into the room.'

31:21.575 --> 31:23.838
I am aware that you
have the real painting.

31:23.925 --> 31:27.015
Oh, really?
You are aware?

31:27.102 --> 31:29.800
And how are you
aware of this?

31:29.888 --> 31:33.630
A guess, confirmed by
a predatory smile on your face

31:33.717 --> 31:36.111
when you asked me
about it just then.

31:36.198 --> 31:37.765
You enjoy trapping people in

31:37.852 --> 31:39.898
'nets of their own
making, don't you?'

31:39.985 --> 31:43.031
That's-that's, um-m,
that's very perceptive of you.

31:43.118 --> 31:45.207
Not really.

31:45.294 --> 31:46.948
[chuckles]

31:47.035 --> 31:50.256
Most successful criminal
bosses share a similar profile

31:50.343 --> 31:52.562
sadistic, violent

31:52.649 --> 31:56.958
but also highly methodical
and psychologically astute.

31:57.045 --> 32:00.092
[chuckles]

32:00.179 --> 32:02.529
Why are you here, Mr. Jane?

32:02.616 --> 32:05.140
I'm a detective...of sorts.

32:05.227 --> 32:06.489
[Arlov speaking Russian]

32:17.022 --> 32:17.979
Explain.

32:18.066 --> 32:18.980
I'm trying to find out

32:19.067 --> 32:20.242
who killed Harry Lashley.

32:20.329 --> 32:21.287
Who?

32:21.374 --> 32:22.723
The man who died in the course

32:22.810 --> 32:23.942
of the painting's theft.

32:24.029 --> 32:26.596
Oh, yes, yes, I recall.
Poor fellow.

32:26.683 --> 32:29.121
If you're looking for
a bribe, I'm afraid, um..

32:29.208 --> 32:30.470
...you're running out of luck.

32:30.557 --> 32:31.950
You see, uh..

32:32.037 --> 32:33.908
...you do understand
that I have immunity

32:33.995 --> 32:35.170
from prosecution
in this country?

32:35.257 --> 32:37.346
I know, I know. No touching.

32:37.433 --> 32:40.654
I show you my identification to
discourage you from killing me

32:40.741 --> 32:43.352
or torturing me or something.

32:43.439 --> 32:44.832
You might not get
arrested for it

32:44.919 --> 32:46.442
but you sure will make
some kind of a fuss.

32:46.529 --> 32:48.967
Oh, I don't mind fuss,
you know?

32:49.054 --> 32:50.533
Anything to avoid boredom.

32:50.620 --> 32:52.274
Given your immunity you
could tell me who you

32:52.361 --> 32:54.755
bought the painting from?
And do no harm to yourself.

32:54.842 --> 32:57.758
And inform to the police? Why?
Why on earth would I do that?

32:57.845 --> 33:00.543
Harry Lashley didn't
deserve to die.

33:00.630 --> 33:02.632
He has a wife who needs
to know what happened.

33:02.719 --> 33:03.851
She deserves justice.

33:03.938 --> 33:06.071
[laughs]

33:06.158 --> 33:09.552
Are you serious?
"She deserves justice", huh?

33:09.639 --> 33:11.076
Perhaps you haven't
paid the full price

33:11.163 --> 33:12.686
for the painting yet.

33:12.773 --> 33:15.994
Perhaps an arrest would
save you some...money.

33:16.081 --> 33:18.953
Oh, well, that's-that's
not a bad thought.

33:19.040 --> 33:22.391
But you see, I-I
love my art collection.

33:22.478 --> 33:24.393
I-I love beauty.

33:24.480 --> 33:26.700
It's why I do what
I do, you know?

33:26.787 --> 33:28.528
Who would want to
sell to me if I start

33:28.615 --> 33:30.486
sending my suppliers
to jail, you know?

33:30.573 --> 33:32.271
True.

33:32.358 --> 33:35.100
Well, I thought
it was worth a try.

33:35.187 --> 33:38.320
Hmm, thank you, and I'm
sorry for wasting your time.

33:38.407 --> 33:41.541
Oh, no, no, no.
Not at all. Not at all.

33:41.628 --> 33:45.632
You are a, uh, very...very
strange kind of policeman.

33:45.719 --> 33:47.068
It's been most diverting.

33:47.155 --> 33:49.679
Could I see it before I leave..

33:49.766 --> 33:51.116
..."The Moro?"

33:51.203 --> 33:52.900
I'm told, it's very beautiful.

33:52.987 --> 33:56.295
Oh, you-you appreciate art, huh?

33:56.382 --> 33:58.427
Well, hmm. Why not?

33:58.514 --> 33:59.950
Of course.

34:00.038 --> 34:01.256
[speaks Russian]

34:07.349 --> 34:08.655
What's happening?

34:08.742 --> 34:12.485
Soon. Get ready.

34:12.572 --> 34:14.487
Here you go. Look at that.

34:14.574 --> 34:17.446
It's a...an Italian
silk merchant's wife.

34:17.533 --> 34:20.406
It's 600 years old.
It's, uh, and it's alive.

34:20.493 --> 34:23.583
It's...it's immortal.

34:23.670 --> 34:24.627
May I?

34:27.978 --> 34:30.024
Please. Please.

34:30.111 --> 34:31.852
[gasps]

34:31.939 --> 34:35.899
Now I understand why you went
to such lengths to get her.

34:35.986 --> 34:37.945
She is beautiful.

34:38.032 --> 34:40.208
Now.

34:40.295 --> 34:42.080
[fire alarm bleeping]

34:46.997 --> 34:48.042
[Arlov]
'Everybody out.'

34:50.175 --> 34:54.266
Out. Out, out.
Please, out.

34:54.353 --> 34:55.484
Out, out, out!

34:58.835 --> 35:00.272
Out!

35:00.359 --> 35:01.316
[speaking Russian]

35:09.803 --> 35:10.717
- Well?
- Well?

35:10.804 --> 35:11.718
[chuckles]

35:11.805 --> 35:12.762
Yes!

35:14.721 --> 35:16.462
You better call Lisbon,
give her an update.

35:16.549 --> 35:18.812
- You call her.
- Oh, I can't. I'm driving. Cho?

35:18.899 --> 35:20.422
- No way.
- Oh, come on, guys.

35:20.509 --> 35:21.858
I just robbed a Russian mobster.

35:21.945 --> 35:23.643
You can't call Lisbon?
Whoo!

35:23.730 --> 35:25.862
[chuckles]
Ha ha.

35:27.734 --> 35:29.344
[Jane]
'You're gonna be grumpy
like this in the room?'

35:29.431 --> 35:31.390
- Yes, I am.
- I'm just asking.

35:31.477 --> 35:33.000
I don't think
it's very professional.

35:33.087 --> 35:35.742
- Seriously, don't push me.
- I said I'm sorry.

35:35.829 --> 35:38.440
You had express orders
to stay away from Arlov.

35:38.527 --> 35:40.703
But that's why I didn't tell
you. You have total deniability.

35:40.790 --> 35:41.791
But that's beside the point.

35:41.878 --> 35:43.010
The point is, my brilliant plan

35:43.097 --> 35:44.142
worked like clockwork.

35:44.229 --> 35:46.100
What plan? This case
is not closed.

35:46.187 --> 35:49.538
- You haven't done anything yet.
- Not yet, but you watch.

35:49.625 --> 35:51.627
No, I disagree. Mm-hmm.

35:51.714 --> 35:53.281
[knocking]
Morning!

35:55.022 --> 35:57.416
I'll get back to you.

35:57.503 --> 35:59.244
Ta-da!

35:59.331 --> 36:01.333
What the hell?

36:01.420 --> 36:03.509
You got it back.

36:03.596 --> 36:05.075
Bring her to me.

36:05.163 --> 36:08.078
Oh, baby! Oh!

36:08.166 --> 36:09.384
'This is fabulous.'

36:09.471 --> 36:11.386
Was it Arlov?
Did he have it?

36:11.473 --> 36:13.649
- Yes, it was.
- How did you get it back?

36:13.736 --> 36:17.827
- Oh, um...hmm. I stole it.
- Are you serious?

36:17.914 --> 36:20.613
Well, there was nothing we
could do legally, as you said.

36:20.700 --> 36:23.137
'But Arlov was in possession
of a stolen painting.'

36:23.224 --> 36:25.531
So there was nothing
he could do either.

36:25.618 --> 36:27.794
This gets better and better.

36:27.881 --> 36:30.013
First of all, I get
the painting back.

36:30.100 --> 36:32.494
Second...when Arlov finds out

36:32.581 --> 36:34.235
'that I've got it,
it'll kill him.'

36:34.322 --> 36:36.106
Who cares about Arlov?

36:36.194 --> 36:37.804
Who cares about
the damn painting?

36:40.328 --> 36:42.417
You assured me you would
find Harry's killer.

36:42.504 --> 36:44.245
We're doing everything
we can, Stevie

36:44.332 --> 36:46.073
'but there's not a lot
left for us to do.'

36:46.160 --> 36:48.206
Look, Stevie,
I know you loved him.

36:48.293 --> 36:50.904
And I liked him, too,
but he was part of this theft.

36:50.991 --> 36:54.777
He betrayed me. In a way, this
is a good thing that he's gone

36:54.864 --> 36:56.562
because you could be having
children with this bum

36:56.649 --> 36:58.303
right now. Alright, you
think of that.

36:58.390 --> 37:00.218
We dodged a bullet here.

37:00.305 --> 37:01.958
Come on, give me a hug.

37:02.045 --> 37:03.221
[chuckles]

37:03.308 --> 37:05.875
Look, we're gonna
find you a good man.

37:05.962 --> 37:09.270
The main thing is we
sent out a message here

37:09.357 --> 37:12.621
that nobody messes
with A.P. Caid.

37:12.708 --> 37:14.319
Thank you, thank you.

37:24.590 --> 37:25.765
I had a daughter once.

37:29.334 --> 37:34.339
She died...killed.
It was my fault.

37:34.426 --> 37:35.818
That's how I know
that a man who treats

37:35.905 --> 37:37.603
his only daughter the
way you do is a fool.

37:37.690 --> 37:39.474
- Jane.
- What did you say?

37:39.561 --> 37:42.434
Your child is hurting and you're
crowing over this petty victory

37:42.521 --> 37:45.088
'like a cockerel
on a dung heap.'

37:45.175 --> 37:48.831
You're a blind, vain,
emotionally stunted fool.

37:48.918 --> 37:51.747
You care more about this,
for this painting

37:51.834 --> 37:56.926
for all this rubbish...than you
do...the child that loves you.

37:57.013 --> 37:58.537
You found my painting.

37:58.624 --> 38:02.062
I am grateful. And now...I'm
going to be patient

38:02.149 --> 38:05.108
and tell you, you get this
clown out of my office--

38:05.195 --> 38:06.806
- How am I gonna make you--
- Right now.

38:06.893 --> 38:08.590
How am I gonna make you
understand, see this?

38:08.677 --> 38:11.332
- Jane--
- See this? This is nothing.

38:11.419 --> 38:12.594
- It's nothing.
- 'What are you doing?'

38:12.681 --> 38:13.987
- 'Jane.'
- Hey!

38:14.074 --> 38:15.293
- 'No! No!'
- Hey, what are you, nuts?

38:15.380 --> 38:17.338
'Oh, my God! Jane?'

38:17.425 --> 38:20.123
- Jane, have you gone crazy?
- Oh, no, I'm just doing my job.

38:20.210 --> 38:22.300
Look. You'd think that someone
that has dedicated their lives

38:22.387 --> 38:24.954
to fine art would want to save
a masterpiece from burning up.

38:25.041 --> 38:28.523
Wouldn't you? Unless she already
knew it was just another fake.

38:28.610 --> 38:31.787
No, not at all. I'm just...I'm
just shocked, that's all.

38:31.874 --> 38:33.920
- Is it a fake?
- 'Yes, it is.'

38:34.007 --> 38:35.313
I only found out
after I stole it

38:35.400 --> 38:37.271
but Kathryn knew,
because...it was

38:37.358 --> 38:39.099
'she who stole the original'

38:39.186 --> 38:44.409
and it is she who still has
it in her safe possession.

38:44.496 --> 38:45.975
- No.
- Is that true, Kathryn?

38:46.062 --> 38:47.673
No.

38:47.760 --> 38:50.850
Horrible job you found
for yourself, Kathryn.

38:50.937 --> 38:53.983
Helping a greedy egotist
snatch up beautiful things

38:54.070 --> 38:56.725
'he has no ability
to appreciate.'

38:56.812 --> 38:59.641
And you don't get
paid much, do you?

38:59.728 --> 39:02.209
All the money...
beauty around you

39:02.296 --> 39:05.125
and you can't have any of it.

39:05.212 --> 39:07.127
Very frustrating.

39:07.214 --> 39:09.564
Not at all.

39:09.651 --> 39:12.350
Harry came to you for
advice about the painting.

39:12.437 --> 39:16.049
You asked him to make a second
copy for your own personal use.

39:17.529 --> 39:21.054
Did you blackmail him...huh?

39:21.141 --> 39:23.839
Must've known about the
theft conviction in Canada.

39:23.926 --> 39:26.407
Threatened to tell A.P.
and destroy the life

39:26.494 --> 39:28.278
'he was building with Stevie.'

39:28.366 --> 39:29.584
Care to comment on that?

39:29.671 --> 39:31.847
It's all nonsense, A.P.
It's all nonsense.

39:31.934 --> 39:34.633
Oh, is it? The reason
you had two copies made

39:34.720 --> 39:37.375
so that you could sell one
to Arlov, and you could keep

39:37.462 --> 39:40.639
the original picture
for yourself

39:40.726 --> 39:42.815
because, of course

39:42.902 --> 39:44.904
'you're the only one
that really deserves it.'

39:44.991 --> 39:46.775
It was her? She did it?

39:46.862 --> 39:49.343
'Yes, like I switched
the paintings with Arlov'

39:49.430 --> 39:52.999
she switched the
original with...Harry.

39:53.086 --> 39:54.957
Right before it went
into the vault.

39:55.044 --> 39:58.526
All you had to do...was come
up in here after hours

39:58.613 --> 40:00.354
and take it off the wall.

40:05.185 --> 40:07.056
[Patrick]
But Harry suspected
something, didn't he?

40:07.143 --> 40:08.884
He tried to stop you.

40:16.892 --> 40:19.678
[grunts]

40:19.765 --> 40:22.289
And you killed him.

40:22.376 --> 40:24.073
Tell the truth, Kathryn.
Our people are going through

40:24.160 --> 40:25.901
your apartment right now.

40:25.988 --> 40:27.947
'They will find that painting.'

40:28.034 --> 40:30.340
Even if they have to tear
the place to the ground.

40:30.428 --> 40:32.560
There is no point
in lying anymore.

40:34.562 --> 40:37.260
I'm sorry.

40:37.347 --> 40:39.088
I never meant to kill him.

40:39.175 --> 40:41.003
'Why did he try to stop me?'

40:41.090 --> 40:43.092
- No!
- No, no, baby. No, no, don't.

40:43.179 --> 40:44.180
- It was an accident.
- Kathryn.

40:44.267 --> 40:45.312
You're under arrest

40:45.399 --> 40:46.313
for the murder
of Harry Lashley.

40:46.400 --> 40:47.749
Put your hands behind your back.

40:47.836 --> 40:49.534
Oh, I'm so sorry, I'm so
sorry. It was a mistake.

40:49.621 --> 40:51.318
Come on. Let's go.

40:58.064 --> 40:59.761
Uh, for what it's worth

40:59.848 --> 41:04.940
uh, I-I just wanted to apologize
for my pious rant earlier.

41:05.027 --> 41:07.856
I needed a pretext
to burn the picture, and..

41:07.943 --> 41:11.773
...your family dysfunction
became it.

41:11.860 --> 41:15.081
Well, no, sir.
No apology needed.

41:15.168 --> 41:17.257
There was some good,
hard truth in what you said.

41:17.344 --> 41:19.389
Yes, there was.

41:19.477 --> 41:21.914
But you know, no one likes
to be too judgmental.

41:23.785 --> 41:24.786
[chuckles]

41:31.663 --> 41:34.100
- Hard to believe it's a fake.
- Crazy, isn't it?

41:35.971 --> 41:37.625
One painting's worth $50
million, the other's only worth

41:37.712 --> 41:40.323
a few thousand.

41:40.410 --> 41:41.934
They look identical.

41:42.021 --> 41:43.457
Yep. Crazy.

41:46.025 --> 41:48.593
Now that you mention it,
I'm not sure, uh..

41:54.599 --> 41:56.905
Uh, it's just so hard
to keep track after a while.

42:01.562 --> 42:03.477
[intense music]

42:19.362 --> 42:22.191
[male narrator]
Stay tuned for scenes
from our next episode.

42:25.151 --> 42:26.369
[theme music]
