00:02.094 --> 00:04.294
Last season on The O.C.:
Theresa's pregnant.

00:04.414 --> 00:06.054
- You don't have to leave.
- Then come with me.

00:06.134 --> 00:08.494
I'm leaving. Can't let Theresa do this by herself.

00:08.534 --> 00:10.054
Oh, my God. It's a palace!

00:10.214 --> 00:12.693
Look, you're getting what you wanted
I'm moving in with you.

00:12.854 --> 00:14.934
- Going somewhere?
- Like, say, San Quentin.

00:14.974 --> 00:17.054
- Thank you.
- Could we convince you to stay?

00:17.214 --> 00:20.174
He's the first real friend I've ever had.
The only real friend I've ever had.

00:20.294 --> 00:23.494
I understand why you have to do this,
but I wish you didn't have to.

00:23.734 --> 00:27.054
Before he got here, I was the biggest loser.
This place was hell for me.

00:27.134 --> 00:30.494
I can't even imagine what it's going
to be like here without him.

00:32.000 --> 00:38.074

00:40.814 --> 00:44.294
So, we've knocked down the
retaining wall to allow for more flow.

00:44.574 --> 00:47.734
Great, now, when do you think
we will have achieved flow?

00:48.054 --> 00:49.894
When do you think we'll be done
tearing your house apart?

00:50.054 --> 00:52.974
Well, my house is torn apart and
construction's got nothing to do with it.

00:53.094 --> 00:54.454
Ballpark, Archie, ballpark.

00:54.654 --> 00:57.774
It's September now. I'd say two weeks.
A month, tops.

00:58.934 --> 01:01.654
- Six weeks.
- Well, in the meantime...

01:05.054 --> 01:09.774
In the meantime, could you please try to
convince the fellas here to wear something in a shirt?

01:10.174 --> 01:12.934
My neighbors have started to
refer to my home as The Man Hole.

01:13.094 --> 01:14.974
- Too, uh, Village People?
- Exactly.

01:15.294 --> 01:18.054
- I'll talk to my guys.
- Hey, Archie... Sandy.

01:22.054 --> 01:24.494
Oh, and don't ever get married,

01:24.694 --> 01:27.054
and if you do, don't ever have kids.

01:29.094 --> 01:32.814
Well, good news. Archie thinks the
remodel should be done anytime between

01:32.894 --> 01:34.934
now and, well, he didn't say never,

01:35.334 --> 01:37.534
but there was subtext.
I'd love some coffee.

01:39.854 --> 01:40.814
Thank you.

01:41.374 --> 01:44.094
Boy, am I excited to head into court for day one

01:44.254 --> 01:46.534
of this riveting nuisance lawsuit,

01:46.814 --> 01:51.934
where one yacht owner feels that this other yacht owner
is in violation of the noise ordinance at Crystal Cove.

01:53.894 --> 01:57.654
Butterscotch duck in El Paso, lampshade,
truck stop, stethoscope...

01:57.734 --> 02:00.454
I know you're doing that thing
where you think that I'm ignoring you

02:00.454 --> 02:02.694
so you start speaking in gibberish
to see if I'm listening.

02:03.054 --> 02:04.934
Aw... You were listening.

02:05.294 --> 02:06.254
Nope.

02:06.574 --> 02:09.894
I'm distracted by today's paper.
Actually, the date of today's paper.

02:10.294 --> 02:13.134
- He's going to come back.
- By the time school starts

02:13.294 --> 02:15.974
or by the time Archie finishes the remodel?

02:16.574 --> 02:20.894
- What do you want me to do?
Tie him up and stuff him in the trunk?
- At this point? Yes.

02:22.294 --> 02:25.534
I have had enough of your hippie-parenting, psycho-babble.

02:25.854 --> 02:27.494
Oh, so that's the problem.

02:27.654 --> 02:31.894
It's not your smothering overprotectiveness that kept
him from ever having a friend till Ryan came along.

02:32.534 --> 02:35.134
Sometimes the best thing for a kid is to have some space.

02:35.494 --> 02:38.254
The Pacific Ocean? That's not enough space?

02:38.454 --> 02:41.134
If you force him to come home, he's
going to want to run away again.

02:42.094 --> 02:44.054
I don't care what he wants.

02:44.094 --> 02:47.214
I don't care what he thinks is fair.
He could have died out there.

02:47.454 --> 02:49.254
Okay, so you can blame me.

02:49.374 --> 02:52.854
And he can blame us.
And we can keep passing the buck all summer long.

02:52.894 --> 02:55.334
Summer is over. School is starting.

02:55.494 --> 02:58.574
This is where he belongs. He's going to figure that out.

02:58.694 --> 03:00.654
I'm tired of waiting for that.

03:01.094 --> 03:02.814
Bring him home, Sandy.

03:03.534 --> 03:05.694
Bring him home.

03:43.164 --> 03:45.164
DVDRip Subtitle Resync by MageMinds
La vie est belle!

03:49.389 --> 03:51.669
(SUMMER: Oh, could it be any hotter?)

03:52.069 --> 03:55.589
I feel like my flesh is melting.
I just hope it melts evenly.

04:01.029 --> 04:03.989
Damn, girl, break me off a piece of dat.

04:09.989 --> 04:12.829
He's totally checking you out.

04:14.749 --> 04:18.988
So my mom's trying to drag me to the Cardio Bar again.
It's her idea of mother-daughter bonding.

04:19.269 --> 04:23.029
- Cardio Bar, Coop?
- Well, she says it's the new Tae Bo,
so maybe I can learn to kick her ass.

04:23.269 --> 04:25.029
I don't think you need to do anymore cardio.

04:26.069 --> 04:29.669
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing. It's just that,

04:30.189 --> 04:34.309
and I mean this in the least scandalous
way... but you're looking a little thin.

04:35.389 --> 04:37.589
- I eat.
- Okay.

04:39.669 --> 04:41.989
Oh, God. You definitely drink.

04:42.549 --> 04:46.829
- What's in this, lighter fluid?
- This is a Newport Beach iced tea.

04:47.109 --> 04:50.749
- This is 10:00 in the morning. It's a little early.
- For who?

04:55.629 --> 04:59.949
Oh, this bikini is so uncomfortable.
I need to go get a new one.
You want to go to South Coast?

05:00.309 --> 05:04.909
- Totally. There's a Paul Frank sale there Wednesday.
- Wednesday? I can't. I have plans with Zach.

05:04.989 --> 05:07.469
- Oh, more plans with Zach, huh?
- Yes.

05:07.789 --> 05:10.709
The more time I spend with Zach,
the less time I have to think about...

05:10.989 --> 05:12.829
God, what's his face?

05:13.109 --> 05:16.389
Built like a beanpole, curly hair,
runs away like a little bitch on a sailboat,

05:16.469 --> 05:19.909
leaving nothing but a note for his girlfriend,
who cried and cried over him until the Fourth of July

05:19.989 --> 05:23.029
when she decided she doesn't cry over bitches on boats.

05:23.909 --> 05:24.629
Seth.

05:25.989 --> 05:27.829
His name, it's Seth.

05:27.949 --> 05:30.789
I know. I'm just doing that thing where I pretend I don't

05:30.829 --> 05:34.869
and I have to use a lot of descriptive
insults to give voice to my inner pain.

05:39.629 --> 05:42.309
- So, yeah, I can't do it Wednesday.
- More plans with Zach.

05:42.709 --> 05:46.149
Well, it's a formality, really.
I refuse to get close to him.

05:47.029 --> 05:51.909
- I will never be close to a boy again.
- Yeah, I know what you mean.

06:05.589 --> 06:08.069
That's good. All right, thanks for the ride.

06:08.189 --> 06:10.149
Oh, don't forget your lunch.

06:10.549 --> 06:12.589
I, uh, peeled your orange for you.

06:13.109 --> 06:16.229
Thanks, but, uh, it's probably not the
best way to fit in with these guys.

06:17.229 --> 06:18.949
Right.

06:22.869 --> 06:26.589
- All right, well, I'll, uh...
- You don't want the foreman to get angry.

06:26.749 --> 06:29.189
He's always angry. He's an angry man.

06:31.269 --> 06:34.349
Maybe tonight we could rent a
movie or play pool or something.

06:34.629 --> 06:37.669
Yeah, pool sounds good. See ya.

06:49.109 --> 06:52.349
Honey? I've got to pick up Kaitlin from junior lifeguards.

06:52.549 --> 06:55.629
Maybe she can save her sister from drowning in self-pity.

06:55.829 --> 06:59.989
What is that flower truck doing in our driveway?
I get the feeling that it's been there every week.

07:00.229 --> 07:01.949
Because it has.

07:02.709 --> 07:07.389
- We get flowers delivered every week?
- Yes, they're living things, they die.

07:09.389 --> 07:12.469
Do you hear a clicking on the phone?
Every time I try to dial out,

07:12.589 --> 07:16.349
- I swear, I hear a clicking.
- Okay, Nixon, paranoid much?

07:17.909 --> 07:19.429
What's going on with you, Cal?

07:19.549 --> 07:22.309
You're either hopped up on blow
or something is seriously wrong.

07:22.389 --> 07:26.709
It's nothing. It's my blood-thinning medication.
Sometimes it makes me feel...

07:26.829 --> 07:29.029
Whacko? Like all summer long?

07:30.629 --> 07:34.789
- I'm taking Kaitlin to go look at new ponies.
- What's wrong with China?

07:36.149 --> 07:38.309
China has alopecia.

07:38.869 --> 07:42.869
I was hoping that the hair treatments
would work, but... bald as a baby's ass.

07:43.149 --> 07:46.149
It's just not right for a little girl to love a hairless pony.

07:46.389 --> 07:48.709
- Yeah, I suppose that's fair.
- Thanks.

07:49.789 --> 07:52.549
Not charging it on the company card, are you?

07:54.309 --> 07:55.429
Why?

07:57.549 --> 08:02.469
Because we can't claim Kaitlin's new
pony as a business expense. It's illegal.

08:02.829 --> 08:05.829
Oh, I know. I was going to put it on the black card.

08:06.229 --> 08:08.029
Bye, sweetie.

08:36.029 --> 08:38.269
- Hello?
- Uh, Luke, it's Kirsten.

08:38.469 --> 08:40.389
Hey, Mrs. Cohen, how you doing?

08:40.869 --> 08:45.509
- Although I think I can answer that one for myself.
- Yeah. Is, uh, is he there?

08:47.109 --> 08:48.629
It's for you.

08:49.829 --> 08:51.909
- Hello?
- Seth, it's Mom.

08:52.029 --> 08:56.269
Mom. Hmm. Blonde?
Sharp, angular features?
Cute little nose?

08:57.949 --> 09:00.269
- Come home.
- Did Ryan come back?

09:00.549 --> 09:04.429
- Seth Ezekiel.
- Okay, using the dreaded middle name
is not the best way to forge a bond.

09:04.469 --> 09:06.029
This has gone on long enough.

09:06.109 --> 09:09.949
Ah, not quite yet. I just signed up to
teach more sailing lessons through September.

09:10.149 --> 09:12.229
- Portland needs me, mother.
- So do I.

09:13.629 --> 09:16.269
Here's the thing, though. I hate it there.

09:16.469 --> 09:20.269
I'm never coming back to O.C.
Now, if you and Dad want to move to, I don't know,

09:20.349 --> 09:22.709
say, anywhere else on the planet, then we can talk.

09:23.149 --> 09:27.909
And here I was, crazy to think that a simple appeal
from a mother to a son might get some traction.

09:27.989 --> 09:30.109
Yeah, well, that is crazy. Bye.

09:30.389 --> 09:32.749
So you're just going to hang up on...

09:40.189 --> 09:43.749
- Gave in and called him, huh?
- He used to be such a sweet kid.

09:43.829 --> 09:46.709
He's turning out to be quite the angry young man.

09:46.829 --> 09:48.789
I had the same talk with him this afternoon.

09:48.949 --> 09:52.869
Doesn't he know that we didn't want
Ryan to leave any more than he did?

09:53.669 --> 09:57.549
Oh, right now, it's... it's not about what he knows.

09:58.189 --> 10:00.749
It's about how he feels.

10:03.429 --> 10:05.949
This house just seems so empty.

10:09.149 --> 10:11.349
And yet so full.

10:11.949 --> 10:15.669
Full of sweaty, shirtless men.
You'd think you'd be in heaven.

10:18.349 --> 10:22.869
- Oh, that's Jimmy. I said that we were
going to have dinner with him, but...
- I'll talk to him.

10:25.229 --> 10:27.909
- Jimbo, how goes it?
- It goes fantastic.

10:28.549 --> 10:33.629
- You guys still going to join me
and Haley on the boat for dinner?
- No. Kirsten's not feeling so great.

10:34.149 --> 10:37.509
- Seth still won't come home, huh?
- Oh, he'll come home, you know...

10:37.669 --> 10:39.629
He's got no real choice.

10:39.789 --> 10:43.029
I'm just trying to figure out the
best way for him to realize that.

10:44.149 --> 10:48.029
Well, if you're too tough on him and
you bring him back kicking and screaming...

10:48.229 --> 10:50.149
No, no, it'll only make things worse.

10:50.349 --> 10:54.469
The last thing anybody wants is a bitter,
resentful teenager in the house.

10:55.429 --> 10:58.589
He won't talk to me.
He won't talk to Kirsten.

10:58.789 --> 11:01.189
Well, maybe there's somebody else he'll talk to.

11:09.189 --> 11:12.829
Oh, I wanted to make sure you weren't
slacking off. Trying to punch out early.

11:12.989 --> 11:15.909
- I wish. How are you?
- Uh, pretty good. You?

11:16.349 --> 11:21.109
- That was real nice of Kirsten to send over those baby clothes.
- Oh, please, Kirsten loves to shop, even for the unborn.

11:21.549 --> 11:25.149
- How's the remodel going?
- A lot like this... a disaster.

11:25.669 --> 11:29.949
- As long as it keeps her distracted, right?
- It's not really doing the trick anymore.

11:31.229 --> 11:34.189
- Seth wants to stay in Portland?
- School is right around the corner

11:34.309 --> 11:37.149
and everybody is digging in their heels, holding their positions.

11:37.549 --> 11:40.309
- So you going up there?
- Yeah, I've always liked Luke.

11:40.349 --> 11:42.949
He's like a big, golden retriever.

11:45.589 --> 11:49.149
- Actually, he kind of is.
- You want to come?

11:49.909 --> 11:53.749
One-two punch...
it might be more effective. You and me?

11:54.389 --> 11:56.549
Unbeatable combination.

11:57.029 --> 12:00.429
He was pretty mad at me last time I saw him.
We haven't talked since and...

12:00.709 --> 12:03.749
- Oh, he's pretty mad at everybody.
- I don't know, Theresa's got some tests,

12:03.789 --> 12:06.349
- I've got work...
- Well...

12:08.069 --> 12:12.349
just in case. And don't worry if you don't use it.
I got a great fare.

12:21.549 --> 12:23.109
Good luck.

12:24.469 --> 12:25.989
Take care, kid.

13:03.829 --> 13:07.109
*You got me all wrong*

13:10.429 --> 13:14.749
*You left me underwater*

13:17.189 --> 13:21.149
*To tumble and fall*

13:23.429 --> 13:26.749
*So many years ago*

13:30.789 --> 13:34.789
*You got me all wrong*

13:37.109 --> 13:43.229
*You got me all wrong*

13:43.829 --> 13:49.109
*You got me all wrong*

13:53.115 --> 13:55.835
Breakfast is ready. My mom left early, so there's plenty.

14:00.155 --> 14:02.555
- What's that?
- Nothing, uh... Sandy needed some help

14:02.915 --> 14:06.275
- convincing Seth to come home.
- Is that why he came by yesterday?

14:06.795 --> 14:10.235
- Cause you said he was just checking in.
- Yeah... nah... I don't know. I mean,

14:10.475 --> 14:14.115
- Seth's still angry. I guess he blames his parents.
- For you leaving?

14:17.075 --> 14:19.755
I can't imagine what he thinks about me.

14:20.435 --> 14:23.875
- So you gonna go to Portland?
- No, I can't.

14:24.115 --> 14:27.595
- You should go if you want to go.
- It's for them to figure out... It's their family.

14:27.915 --> 14:30.515
- You're not part of their family?
- Not anymore.

14:30.955 --> 14:33.035
I should get to work.

14:46.955 --> 14:52.475
Hey, Cal. Always a pleasure, although, if I may,
why we meeting in a parking garage?

14:52.795 --> 14:55.995
Because my office might be bugged.
My home, your home...

14:56.315 --> 15:00.075
- who knows what the Feds are up to.
- You've really flipped your noodle, haven't you?

15:00.315 --> 15:04.715
Hey, I could be wearing a wire.
You never know.
Sure you don't want to frisk me?

15:04.875 --> 15:09.315
- I don't have time for your jokes.
- Nor do I. I've got to be at the
OC airport in half an hour.

15:09.675 --> 15:11.995
- I'm heading up to Portland.
- To see Seth?

15:12.035 --> 15:13.635
- Yeah.
- I don't get it.

15:13.715 --> 15:18.075
His best friend leaves so he runs
off with another boy and his gay dad?

15:18.275 --> 15:20.475
You've got to admit, it sounds kind of strange.

15:20.675 --> 15:24.555
And this coming from a guy who is one click
away from wearing a wig and a fake mustache.

15:24.955 --> 15:29.035
- You think my paranoia is unfounded?
- It's entertaining but completely unfounded.

15:29.275 --> 15:33.435
- I haven't heard anything from any
of my friends at the DA's office.
- It doesn't make any sense.

15:33.635 --> 15:37.475
The DA comes to see me at the beginning
of summer, and tells me the sky is falling

15:37.675 --> 15:41.995
- and he hasn't done a damn thing since.
- Either they've realized they've got nothing,

15:42.675 --> 15:44.955
or they're building one hell of a case.

15:46.435 --> 15:48.395
I got a plane to catch.

15:55.075 --> 15:57.475
That looks just like, uh...

15:59.275 --> 16:02.075
- Talk to her since your Fourth of July blowout?
- No.

16:02.275 --> 16:04.475
She stopped taking my calls so I stopped making them.

16:04.715 --> 16:09.755
She doesn't understand it's not about her.
Man, you've got some willpower,
because she has a killer rack.

16:14.555 --> 16:16.835
You guys missed the greatest water-ski lesson of all time.

16:16.955 --> 16:20.035
This guy must have been 300 pounds
and he wanted to drop his ski.

16:20.155 --> 16:23.475
I've never seen anyone wipe out
harder in my life. He lost everything.

16:23.595 --> 16:25.315
Including his bathing suit.

16:25.595 --> 16:28.955
- Hey, I'm sorry I missed that.
- Hey, what happened to you last night?

16:29.275 --> 16:32.955
We went to Salty's and my I.D.
finally worked. It was so much fun.

16:33.035 --> 16:34.715
I don't know... I just wasn't up for it.

16:34.835 --> 16:39.315
- Cohen got in a little fight with his mom.
- Thank you. That was both honest and emasculating.

16:39.475 --> 16:43.635
- Parents turning up the heat?
- I guess. It's probably time to tell
them about the home school plan.

16:43.835 --> 16:46.835
I'm sure that will go over really well.
We've got to get back out there.

16:47.195 --> 16:50.715
- Just wanted to share.
- All right, dude. Don't drown.

16:53.035 --> 16:56.795
Oh, hey, if you see any more naked
fat guys, be sure and let Luke know, okay?

17:02.515 --> 17:05.435
Dude. You need to close on Jane before the summer's over.

17:05.675 --> 17:09.275
- I live here; so does she. There's plenty of time.
- Whatever you say.

17:09.994 --> 17:11.875
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Dad. What time's dinner?

17:12.075 --> 17:14.555
Uh, half an hour... and we have a guest.

17:17.234 --> 17:18.954
Hi... Sandy Cohen.

17:21.835 --> 17:23.875
Oh, hey. New car?

17:24.115 --> 17:27.435
My mom gave it to me. It's my getaway car.

17:27.635 --> 17:30.275
- Yeah, what's happening?
- Uh, thank you, you guys, for coming.

17:30.395 --> 17:33.675
Haley is stuck at work, but we're happy to keep you company.

17:33.715 --> 17:37.235
Being in the house by yourself isn't
as wonderful as I had fantasized.

17:37.315 --> 17:39.715
So have you talked to Seth... or Ryan?

17:39.835 --> 17:43.315
I talked at Seth, if it qualifies as a conversation.

17:43.555 --> 17:46.675
Sandy saw Ryan last night.
He seems to be doing well.

17:46.795 --> 17:48.955
- Oh, that's good.
- Do you guys still talk?

17:49.435 --> 17:54.115
Yeah, not really. We used to... but it
just sort of made everything harder.

17:57.715 --> 18:00.915
See? A kid doesn't need to be in Portland to be distant.

18:33.355 --> 18:36.795
So the last I heard, you were opening
a restaurant. How's that going?

18:36.875 --> 18:40.115
Well, it didn't happen.
It's, it's a long story.

18:40.635 --> 18:43.235
But, hey, there are plenty of good restaurants in Newport.

18:43.435 --> 18:46.195
I thought you said that all the restaurants
in Newport were overpriced and oversauced.

18:49.995 --> 18:52.835
I have this thing about sauces.
Less is more.

18:53.515 --> 18:56.875
- So you excited about school?
- It's going to be a little weird.

18:57.035 --> 19:00.235
I've got to meet all the new kids and
they don't have a water polo team.

19:00.435 --> 19:02.915
Hey... some would call that heaven.

19:03.075 --> 19:06.515
The Harbor School just broke ground
on the new gym. It should be beautiful.

19:06.795 --> 19:10.515
- Are you working for the tourism board now?
- Watch your mouth.

19:10.915 --> 19:15.075
- I was trying to be polite. You might want to give it a try.
- No, thanks. I'd rather be honest.

19:15.315 --> 19:19.235
You want to be honest? Well, let's talk about the
spoiled brat who's had everything handed to him.

19:19.475 --> 19:22.835
Whose parents have been busting their asses to
make sure he's happy and how does he repay them?

19:22.915 --> 19:24.635
- This isn't about you.
- Yes, it is.

19:24.715 --> 19:26.515
- You're killing your mother and she is killing me.

19:26.715 --> 19:30.195
You can't spend my entire life telling
me everything that's wrong with Newport,

19:30.235 --> 19:32.435
and then just expect I'm going to go back. You can't do that.

19:32.555 --> 19:34.395
Newport is your home, like it or not.

19:34.715 --> 19:37.315
When you're 18 and you've saved
up enough money, you can move

19:37.355 --> 19:39.675
far away from the parents you resent and the town you loathe.

19:39.715 --> 19:43.195
- You let Ryan go; why not me?
- We invited Ryan into our home.

19:43.315 --> 19:45.555
- You don't get that choice.
- But you didn't even try and stop him.

19:45.715 --> 19:47.995
I mean, you didn't even make an attempt.

19:49.355 --> 19:52.115
- Ryan had to do what he had to do.
- Okay, well, so do I.

20:31.195 --> 20:33.675
*Force yourself*

20:35.475 --> 20:37.515
*Turn it on*

20:39.755 --> 20:42.795
*Comes in waves*

20:43.635 --> 20:44.115
Hello?

20:44.315 --> 20:46.715
*Try to find*

20:47.635 --> 20:48.635
Hello? Who is this?

20:48.715 --> 20:51.915
*Maybe this time*

20:52.835 --> 20:56.035
*Don't turn your head*

20:57.315 --> 21:00.395
*It's easy to forget...*

21:31.595 --> 21:32.755
- Morning.
- Morning.

21:32.835 --> 21:35.635
- You want some coffee?
- Please. Yeah. I make it kind of strong.

21:35.795 --> 21:38.195
Oh, anything this side of motor oil.
I didn't sleep at all.

21:39.195 --> 21:42.155
I'm sorry about our little family drama last night.

21:42.515 --> 21:46.635
- He's a good kid, Sandy. A smart kid.
- He's too smart.

21:47.155 --> 21:50.715
- When is it that the kids get all the power?
- Oh, they've always had the power.

21:50.835 --> 21:55.595
When they're two years old, you're running
after them, trying to make sure they don't get hurt,

21:55.755 --> 21:58.515
and, this is the teenage version of that.

22:00.955 --> 22:02.755
- Carson. Father.
- Son.

22:03.995 --> 22:06.395
I'm going to go see what Luke wants for breakfast.

22:09.555 --> 22:12.035
I believe that was just a convenient
excuse to leave us for round two.

22:12.115 --> 22:14.115
Oh, there is no round two.

22:14.595 --> 22:16.915
- I'm backing your play.
- What?

22:17.155 --> 22:19.395
Is this like a Jedi mind trick or...

22:19.595 --> 22:22.555
No, I... I thought about what you said last night.

22:23.235 --> 22:26.795
I don't know what else to do.
If this is really where you want to be,

22:27.195 --> 22:30.195
- I can't push you to come back.
- So you're letting me stay?

22:30.395 --> 22:34.035
Well, at least I know you're safe here.
It's better than dragging you home

22:35.075 --> 22:39.315
so that when the next time you decide to run away,
you might not leave a note, you might not call.

22:41.355 --> 22:43.475
Well, thank you.

22:44.515 --> 22:47.155
Thank you. I, you know, I'm really sorry

22:47.515 --> 22:50.275
- to drag you all the way up here.
- Well, it was worth it just to see you.

22:50.915 --> 22:53.115
Yeah, you, too.

22:55.395 --> 22:59.195
So, look, you know that I left home
when I was your age and, uh...

22:59.555 --> 23:02.915
I, uh, and I want to say to you what

23:03.395 --> 23:06.995
I wish my parents had said to me.

23:07.515 --> 23:13.075
- We love you. And the door is always open.
- Yeah, I know, I know.

23:18.715 --> 23:21.875
All right. I've got a sailing lesson at 10:00, I gotta...

23:22.155 --> 23:24.315
- Right.
- Thanks.

23:33.075 --> 23:35.235
- Take care of yourself.
- Yeah. Bye.

23:45.355 --> 23:48.675
Hey. So, we should probably leave in a half hour.

23:48.755 --> 23:51.395
- I don't work Saturdays.
- No, my doctor's appointment.

23:52.995 --> 23:55.235
- Ah, right.
- You forgot?

23:55.555 --> 23:57.795
No, no, I, um...

23:58.555 --> 24:01.155
Yeah, I forgot. Sorry.

24:04.955 --> 24:08.555
- What's with the bag?
- I was... going to go to Portland,

24:08.915 --> 24:12.435
Actually. Before I remembered your doctor's appointment.

24:14.155 --> 24:15.555
Except you didn't remember.

24:15.715 --> 24:18.355
I've been to every doctor's appointment.
What are you saying, I don't care?

24:18.435 --> 24:23.315
No, it's just... a plane ticket showing up,
phone calls in the middle of the night.

24:23.955 --> 24:25.235
What's going on?

24:26.115 --> 24:28.755
Look, I left Newport to make life easier for everyone.

24:29.075 --> 24:31.995
It seems like all I did was make everything more complicated.

24:33.555 --> 24:37.155
That's funny, I thought you left Newport to be with me.

24:38.715 --> 24:42.795
I did. All right?
I... I've just got to make things right with Seth.

24:44.115 --> 24:48.675
- Why? It's not like you abandoned him.
- Actually, it kind of is. I just...

24:49.355 --> 24:52.115
I just took off.
I didn't really talk to him about it.

24:54.195 --> 24:57.875
I'm only going to Portland. Are you afraid
I'm going to lose my construction job?

25:01.795 --> 25:03.635
It's just a checkup, you know?

25:03.795 --> 25:07.195
There'll be a lot of sitting around, reading
old TV Guides, listening to bad Muzak.

25:08.355 --> 25:10.755
My mom loves that stuff.

25:20.675 --> 25:22.915
- You sure?
- Yeah.

25:24.435 --> 25:27.115
All right. I've got to run.

25:36.195 --> 25:37.595
Marissa.

25:40.435 --> 25:42.355
Marissa, you're not even ready.

25:43.875 --> 25:45.475
Take your headphones off.

25:46.035 --> 25:48.155
I said, take your headphones off.

25:53.395 --> 25:54.955
I was listening to that, Mom.

25:55.155 --> 25:57.595
We were supposed to leave for Cardio Bar 15 minutes ago.

25:59.075 --> 26:02.115
Oh. Right. Sorry.

26:09.235 --> 26:12.115
Fine. I'm taking this away and you're grounded.

26:12.555 --> 26:14.835
What are you talking about?
You can't ground me.

26:14.995 --> 26:18.555
I most certainly can, because I will not
spend another minute living like this.

26:18.755 --> 26:22.515
- All summer long you've ignored me,
acting like I don't even exist.
- I wish.

26:23.555 --> 26:25.995
What did you say?

26:28.435 --> 26:30.755
Why do we have to keep doing this? Honey

26:30.915 --> 26:34.675
Instead of shutting me out,
just tell me what's bothering you.

26:35.155 --> 26:37.795
You really want to know what's bothering me? Do you?

26:37.995 --> 26:40.835
- Do you really want to know what's on my mind?
- Yes.

27:04.595 --> 27:06.795
Okay, thanks for the head's up, Otis.

27:06.915 --> 27:09.195
I'm going to talk to Caleb as soon as I get back into town.

27:09.355 --> 27:11.595
- Sandy, cab's here.
- All right, thanks.

27:18.195 --> 27:20.195
Oh, I had a feeling I'd see you here.

27:20.395 --> 27:24.195
- What, are you leaving?
- I took my shot. Good luck.

27:28.755 --> 27:30.355
And thanks.

27:35.195 --> 27:37.715
- Summer. Hello.
- Hey, Mrs. Cohen.

27:37.955 --> 27:41.315
- Can I come in?
- Sure. Is everything okay?

27:42.315 --> 27:44.515
- I'm here to get over Seth.
- Excuse me?

27:44.795 --> 27:47.395
My therapist said the best thing I can do to move on in my life

27:47.755 --> 27:50.755
is to divest myself of all of Seth's material possessions.

27:52.035 --> 27:54.795
- I got to dump off a bunch of his crap.
- Oh, right, got it.

27:54.995 --> 27:58.995
My therapist said that it's my best chance
of ever again vibrating at a high frequency.

27:59.155 --> 28:01.595
- Vibrating at a high frequency?
- Lynn Grabhorn.

28:02.035 --> 28:04.395
Excuse Me, Your Life Is Waiting.

28:04.915 --> 28:09.395
Human beings have an electro-chemical currency
running through us, which is affected by our emotions.

28:09.635 --> 28:11.795
When you're feeling happy or joyful,

28:11.995 --> 28:16.035
that current or energy is vibrating at a
higher frequency than when you're feeling

28:16.115 --> 28:18.435
sad or angry, at let's say, Seth Cohen.

28:18.675 --> 28:21.915
When you're vibrating at a higher frequency,
you're more likely to attract happy people

28:21.995 --> 28:25.155
than when you are vibrating at a
low, sad, bitter-at-Cohen frequency.

28:25.355 --> 28:27.795
It's the law of attraction in physics.

28:28.715 --> 28:32.155
You know where to find his room.
Summer? For the record,

28:32.435 --> 28:35.595
if he wasn't my son, I'd do the same thing.

28:56.035 --> 28:58.835
I hope we can still be friends.

29:24.035 --> 29:26.315
What do you say, Cohen?
First up, Madden Football.

29:26.315 --> 29:29.515
- Dude, when are you going to give up the sports games?
- Why would I do that?

29:29.755 --> 29:33.955
- Hey, Dad, is dinner ready yet?
- I got the grill going. And we've got another guest.

29:34.035 --> 29:35.795
- Who is it this time, my mom?

29:43.155 --> 29:46.395
- You, I would not have guessed.
- What's going on, Chino?

29:46.675 --> 29:49.955
- How are you guys?
- Uh, you know, good.

29:50.435 --> 29:52.435
I'm sure you're probably here to do my father's bidding.

29:53.115 --> 29:55.635
But, I don't know, you might as
well stay for a burger, right?

30:08.035 --> 30:10.195
So you learned how to work a grill.

30:10.355 --> 30:13.235
- You've got a step up on your mom.
- I've learned a lot this summer, Ryan.

30:13.355 --> 30:14.955
- Portland seems nice.
- Yeah.

30:15.115 --> 30:18.955
- From the airplane, anyway.
- Yeah, it's awesome. Real people,
real weather, cute girls, too.

30:20.115 --> 30:24.835
- So you and Summer...?
- Not so good, actually.
She'll probably never speak to me again.

30:27.315 --> 30:29.515
It's probably best she moves on, though.

30:29.555 --> 30:33.155
I mean, I don't think we're going to be seeing
too much of each other, I live here now.

30:33.235 --> 30:36.435
- Listen, man, I'm sorry if I caused...
- Dude, honestly, stop.

30:37.235 --> 30:40.395
You did not make me leave Newport, ok?
If anything, the truth of the matter is,

30:40.755 --> 30:43.235
you probably made me stay a
year longer than I should have.

30:43.795 --> 30:46.195
Honestly, like, boarding school, Portland, whatever,

30:46.395 --> 30:50.915
I was out of there sooner or later. I mean,
me and the OC are a truly beatable combination.

30:51.555 --> 30:54.595
It's still a pretty big deal, I mean,
dropping out of school, moving up here?

30:54.795 --> 30:58.835
I don't know, it used to be perfectly normal for teenagers
to board tramp steamers and travel the country.

30:59.075 --> 31:02.315
- That was The Depression; they were looking for work.
- Hobos are hot again.

31:03.395 --> 31:06.315
- So there's no chance of you going back to Newport?
- Are you?

31:09.715 --> 31:13.195
- Well, then, you know...
- Yeah, but, Seth, I can't.

31:14.675 --> 31:16.355
Neither can I.

31:21.242 --> 31:25.642
Got to admit, Jules, you've done well for yourself.
It's everything you always wanted.

31:25.842 --> 31:28.242
- Be careful what you wish for.
- Thanks.

31:28.482 --> 31:32.482
- So what's the matter? What's going on?
- Aside from our daughter being the
spawn of Chuckie and Keith Moon.

31:33.482 --> 31:36.242
She is definitely going through a hard time right now.

31:36.682 --> 31:40.802
Jimmy, you have no idea the
Level Four meltdown I witnessed.

31:41.202 --> 31:44.562
- There was lawn furniture in the pool.
- Sounds like it constitutes a Level Five.

31:45.082 --> 31:48.082
The sad part is, it's the most honest conversation we've had yet.

31:49.442 --> 31:52.922
Thank God Kaitlin's going away to boarding
school. This is no environment for a child.

31:53.282 --> 31:56.722
Marissa, however, is going to be seriously
screwed up for the rest of her life,

31:56.842 --> 31:59.882
permanent damage, Jimmy, unless we do something.

32:00.042 --> 32:03.442
- Like what?
- Provide her with some semblance of a normal family dynamic.

32:03.522 --> 32:06.322
Maybe Sunday dinners you can come over here with, uh...

32:07.322 --> 32:09.442
- Haley?
- Right, right.

32:10.722 --> 32:14.922
- You two are still...
- Yeah, we're doing great. She's fantastic, sweet, limber.

32:16.122 --> 32:18.402
- How about you and Caleb?
- Not so limber.

32:24.522 --> 32:27.922
- I'll help... the best I can. Okay?
- Thank you.

32:28.722 --> 32:31.482
And for the record, I am happy for you.

32:32.282 --> 32:36.482
For the record, I don't believe you,
but for Marissa's sake, I'll pretend to.

32:45.242 --> 32:48.682
I can't believe you talked to the DA's
office yesterday and we're just talking now.

32:48.842 --> 32:50.842
I was trying to bring your grandson home.

32:51.042 --> 32:54.322
- He's staying... thanks for asking.
- He's staying?

32:55.202 --> 32:57.682
Would you like me to talk to him?
I can be quite persuasive.

32:57.882 --> 33:01.042
You'd better rest up and stockpile
some of that persuasiveness.

33:01.242 --> 33:03.122
Why? What did the DA say?

33:03.322 --> 33:05.242
The clouds have gathered, Cal.

33:05.362 --> 33:08.042
It's about to rain down on you.
On all of us.

33:08.562 --> 33:12.002
- So put your storm windows in,
if you know what I mean.
- That bad, huh?

33:12.122 --> 33:16.042
Get your house in order.
The Newport Group,the family. Do it soon.

33:20.282 --> 33:22.562
Come on, Chino. Try and hurt me.

33:23.282 --> 33:26.282
Make me feel pain. Wound me.

33:26.642 --> 33:29.082
Think of all the money Luke saves
on therapy playing these games.

33:29.242 --> 33:32.322
- I think you should still consider therapy.
- Oh, you're going to pay for that.

33:32.642 --> 33:35.922
- Ryan, telephone.
- Good luck.

33:36.042 --> 33:37.922
I'll wait here.

33:38.642 --> 33:40.442
Okay. Here you go.

33:40.842 --> 33:42.162
- Hello?
- Ryan?

33:42.402 --> 33:43.922
Hi. What's wrong?

33:45.602 --> 33:48.242
I went to the doctor's for the checkup

33:49.922 --> 33:52.442
and they couldn't find a heartbeat.

33:53.322 --> 33:58.002
I lost the baby, Ryan. I guess in the first
couple of months, this can happen.

33:59.202 --> 34:01.682
Ok, I'm coming back. I'm getting on the next flight...

34:02.002 --> 34:03.682
- No.
- What?

34:03.922 --> 34:06.962
I think that maybe we should see this as a sign

34:08.842 --> 34:10.681
(You know? I think it's a sign.)

34:12.282 --> 34:15.081
Ryan, you're not happy with me.

34:15.601 --> 34:17.522
You haven't been happy.

34:17.922 --> 34:20.722
The only reason you've stayed is because of this baby...

34:21.762 --> 34:23.681
and now there isn't a baby.

34:25.402 --> 34:26.802
You don't want me to come home.

34:29.922 --> 34:32.242
You don't want to come home.

34:36.562 --> 34:38.681
Is this your battleground? Is this your...

34:39.322 --> 34:41.282
Hey, everything all right?

34:44.641 --> 34:47.042
Theresa lost the baby.

35:32.482 --> 35:34.722
Did you tell him?

35:38.122 --> 35:42.642
- Did he believe you?
- Yeah, I think so.

35:49.322 --> 35:51.042
It's for the best.

35:51.282 --> 35:53.722
For you and him and for the baby.

36:07.162 --> 36:10.322
- What time does your cab get here?
- Any minute.

36:12.962 --> 36:15.482
- What are you going to do now?
- I don't know.

36:15.762 --> 36:19.082
Get my stuff out of Theresa's
and then I'm homeless again.

36:20.242 --> 36:24.082
Have I sold you on the wonders of Portland?
We could take our show on the road.

36:24.882 --> 36:27.442
I can't impose.
Besides, I've got this job.

36:27.682 --> 36:30.242
It pays pretty well, so...
I'll figure something out.

36:30.962 --> 36:35.402
- What about you, man?
- Just keep teaching sailing, hang with Luke.

36:37.442 --> 36:40.642
His dad's dating someone new, so. That should be interesting.

36:41.282 --> 36:43.482
- Sounds fun.
- Plus, you know,

36:44.482 --> 36:48.042
my parents are kind of okay with this now,
and so it's good because I don't have to feel guilty.

36:48.242 --> 36:50.922
- That's great, man.
- Yeah, it's awesome.

36:51.722 --> 36:53.082
It's awesome.

36:53.522 --> 36:54.882
Chino, your cab's here!

36:56.322 --> 36:57.842
All right. Well.

36:58.722 --> 37:00.282
I guess this is it.

37:02.962 --> 37:05.042
Yeah, don't be a stranger.

37:07.522 --> 37:08.922
All right.

37:10.042 --> 37:11.082
See you.

37:33.602 --> 37:36.482
*All of the arms around you now*

37:37.522 --> 37:40.482
*Could they ever catch you then?*

37:41.482 --> 37:44.322
*First you tell me not to fret*

37:45.402 --> 37:48.842
*Then you frighten me again...*

37:53.722 --> 37:56.002
- All right, so, uh... I was thinking.
- I was thinking, too.

37:57.882 --> 38:00.242
You know, they don't even have a water polo team here?

38:00.402 --> 38:02.682
And that's just going to be a problem for me.

38:06.282 --> 38:08.322
- We don't have to hug or anything like that, right?
- Nah.

38:09.322 --> 38:10.402
Okay, come on in.

38:10.562 --> 38:13.162
*You're the brother and the beast*

38:14.082 --> 38:17.722
*You're the friend I knew the best*

38:18.162 --> 38:21.242
*Can't you listen to the past?*

38:22.042 --> 38:24.682
*Can't you let the...*

38:29.922 --> 38:33.082
I kind of like eating amongst the furniture. It's... it's cozy.

38:40.162 --> 38:43.242
Hmm, so we leave for like three months,
you tear the whole place apart?

38:43.642 --> 38:44.722
You're back?

38:46.482 --> 38:49.722
How's that two-for-one special on brooding young men?

38:50.002 --> 38:52.442
- Are you coming back, too?
- Uh, yeah.

38:53.162 --> 38:55.882
It's a long story, but I figured this is where I belong, so.

38:58.802 --> 39:00.682
Uh, what he said.

39:01.842 --> 39:04.722
Good. 'Cause nobody leaves this family twice.

39:05.242 --> 39:06.962
- Welcome home.
- Thanks.

39:27.322 --> 39:29.682
Hey. What's going on?

39:30.522 --> 39:32.802
All right.

39:33.522 --> 39:36.962
- So... good to be back?
- Yeah. Yeah, it is.

39:38.002 --> 39:41.522
- You?
- My room felt...

39:42.282 --> 39:45.602
so much smaller to me.
I don't know, or perhaps...

39:45.762 --> 39:48.042
I've grown quite a bit in the last few months.

39:49.442 --> 39:51.522
Summer had been there, though. She...

39:52.082 --> 39:55.442
dumped everything and anything that reminded her of me.
So that should be really fun, come Monday.

39:55.722 --> 39:59.682
- Yeah, Monday's going to suck.
- You need anything? Want me to, um...

40:00.682 --> 40:03.762
fire up the grill, because, Ryan...
I can do that.

40:04.002 --> 40:06.082
No, I'm good. I'm good. Tired, but good.

40:08.042 --> 40:09.242
Hey! Wait, wait.

40:10.122 --> 40:12.842
How'd you make it all the way to Portland
from Newport in that little catamaran?

40:17.042 --> 40:19.122
Well, Ryan. Sit down my son.

40:19.602 --> 40:24.402
It was a long and torturous journey and I'm not gonna...
not gonna sugarcoat any of the details for you.

40:24.562 --> 40:26.442
- Please don't.
- Because we're friends.

40:27.522 --> 40:31.082
First... I sailed to Catalina.

40:32.042 --> 40:33.482
Then I sailed to Santa Barbara.

40:34.162 --> 40:36.882
In Santa Barbara, I ran out of snacks.

40:37.162 --> 40:40.682
Freaked out a little bit, pawned my boat for cash,
took a Greyhound to Portland.

40:41.402 --> 40:44.002
- You took a bus?
- Yeah, but don't say it like that. It was a local.

40:44.122 --> 40:47.122
Okay? Have you ever been on one of those?
Not for the faint of heart.

40:47.482 --> 40:49.722
I can't believe after all that you took a bus.

40:49.882 --> 40:53.842
I think we're definitely going to have to come up with
a better story for school, though. That'd be good.

40:53.922 --> 40:55.162
No, no, I like the bus idea. It's cool.

40:55.402 --> 40:57.722
But what about maybe, um...

40:58.242 --> 41:01.842
- Boat sank, saved by whales. It's very Whale Rider.
- What else you got?

41:02.162 --> 41:05.482
- I took the boat, the boat sank. Saved by a mermaid.
- Splash.

41:06.322 --> 41:09.602
The boat sank, stranded
on a desert island, uh... volleyball.

41:09.762 --> 41:12.122
We both know that's Castaway. Tom Hanks.

41:12.322 --> 41:14.402
Uh, okay, you'll really like this one.

41:14.642 --> 41:17.322
I get hired by the British Royal Navy to-to-to sail with them

41:17.402 --> 41:19.442
and, I have a master, and he's also my commander...
