00:02.000 --> 00:06.050
Captain's log, star date 41294.5.

00:06.217 --> 00:11.561
Our destination, the Class-M
Beta Cassius planet known as Haven.

00:12.312 --> 00:14.985
It is so renowned
for its peaceful beauty

00:15.151 --> 00:18.742
that some believe it to have
mystical healing powers.

00:18.909 --> 00:23.418
We will rest and relax...
all too briefly, I fear.

00:26.633 --> 00:28.637
Such a beautiful world.

00:29.346 --> 00:34.189
Legends say it has been known
to mend souls and heal broken hearts.

00:34.356 --> 00:37.947
Legends which are
totally unsupported by fact, Captain.

00:38.114 --> 00:40.786
Such legends
are the spice of the universe,

00:40.911 --> 00:44.168
because they have a way
of sometimes coming true.

00:59.198 --> 01:01.077
Lt. Yar to Cmdr Riker,

01:01.243 --> 01:04.583
your presence is requested
in transporter room one.

01:12.140 --> 01:15.397
Sorry, ladies. Duty calls.

01:20.908 --> 01:25.375
- You needed me?
- An object's beaming in from Haven.

01:25.542 --> 01:27.462
- What?
- We're not sure.

01:27.629 --> 01:29.884
Surface station approval's coming in.

01:30.051 --> 01:32.055
Alright, let's bring it in.

01:45.665 --> 01:46.709
Odd looking.

01:52.512 --> 01:53.473
What's going on?

01:55.727 --> 01:59.193
I hold a message for Deanna Troi.

02:00.946 --> 02:06.165
Lwaxana Troi and the honourable
Miller family will soon arrive.

02:06.332 --> 02:10.800
The momentous day is close at hand.
Rejoice.

02:16.394 --> 02:17.771
No.

02:20.110 --> 02:21.445
What's going on?

02:23.616 --> 02:26.580
Jewels! Look at these jewels.

02:28.919 --> 02:34.471
They're bonding gifts,
what you would call wedding presents.

02:35.098 --> 02:36.559
Who's getting married?

02:39.773 --> 02:41.152
I am.

03:02.945 --> 03:06.035
Space, the final frontier.

03:07.746 --> 03:11.670
These are the voyages
of the Starship Enterprise.

03:11.837 --> 03:15.929
Its continuing mission,
to explore strange new worlds,...

03:17.766 --> 03:21.440
..to seek out new life
and new civilizations,...

03:22.359 --> 03:26.033
..to boldly go
where no one has gone before.

04:38.302 --> 04:41.225
I was certain it would never happen,
Captain.

04:42.143 --> 04:44.314
The years I'd spend on this mission,

04:44.481 --> 04:47.320
the distance it has taken me
away from home.

04:48.990 --> 04:54.125
As you must have heard, genetic
bonding is a Betazoid tradition.

04:54.626 --> 04:57.465
Steven Miller
was my father's closest friend.

04:57.632 --> 05:01.223
Your father was human, Deanna.
The Millers are human.

05:01.932 --> 05:05.105
Will you and your husband be
staying with the ship?

05:09.781 --> 05:11.201
No, sir.

05:16.754 --> 05:17.923
Then...

05:22.807 --> 05:27.107
..l will just say
congratulations for now, Deanna.

05:28.444 --> 05:30.030
You'll excuse me?

05:38.339 --> 05:39.508
Bill,...

05:39.675 --> 05:44.183
..more than anything in the world,
anything,...

05:45.143 --> 05:48.609
..you want to be a starship captain,
true?

05:49.528 --> 05:52.993
- That's not all I want, Deanna.
- I can feel that.

05:53.159 --> 05:56.959
I know you care, within those limits.

05:58.713 --> 06:02.177
- Did you hear what I said?
- Every word.

06:03.931 --> 06:06.227
This whole thing is still bizarre.

06:07.480 --> 06:08.524
I'm sorry.

06:10.403 --> 06:12.407
Come dance at my wedding.

06:15.413 --> 06:17.041
I'll try.

06:29.190 --> 06:31.528
A message from planet Haven,
Counsellor.

06:31.695 --> 06:34.910
They wish to beam
the Miller wedding party aboard.

06:48.646 --> 06:52.654
I'm Jean-Luc Picard, Captain of
the Enterprise. Welcome aboard.

06:53.906 --> 06:56.745
Quite some starship you have here,
Captain.

06:58.081 --> 06:59.876
Look forward to this visit.

07:00.545 --> 07:01.922
You couldn't be...

07:03.759 --> 07:04.928
I'm Deanna.

07:07.976 --> 07:13.738
Deanna, darling.
You probably don't even remember me.

07:18.079 --> 07:22.589
Wyatt was absolutely right.
She is a beauty.

07:25.177 --> 07:26.555
I'm Wyatt.

07:31.022 --> 07:33.359
Isn't this simply beautiful?

07:33.736 --> 07:37.493
I knew romance was still alive,
somewhere.

07:37.660 --> 07:40.248
I'd like you to have
this chameleon rose.

07:40.415 --> 07:43.254
It changes colour
with the mood of its owner.

07:43.923 --> 07:46.511
It's wonderful. Thank you.

07:47.931 --> 07:49.726
When is my mother arriving?

07:49.893 --> 07:52.356
Your mother is still on the planet.

07:52.523 --> 07:54.235
Why?

07:54.402 --> 07:57.366
Is there a place
for my parents to rest, Captain?

07:59.203 --> 08:02.669
Well, we're not really tired, son.

08:03.253 --> 08:08.806
Besides,...
I'd like to see some of the ship.

08:08.973 --> 08:11.144
Steven, you know full well

08:11.310 --> 08:16.028
Lwaxana Troi isn't about to
beam on board until we leave.

08:16.947 --> 08:19.995
- So?
- You can see your quarters now.

08:20.162 --> 08:22.959
Show the Millers
to their accommodations.

08:23.126 --> 08:24.713
I shall join you later.

08:31.852 --> 08:34.315
Two more are ready to beam in, sir.

08:36.235 --> 08:37.822
So be it.

08:40.409 --> 08:42.246
Wyatt seems a fine young man.

08:42.414 --> 08:46.715
Yes, he does.
But I'm not what he expected.

08:47.424 --> 08:49.136
I don't understand.

08:49.303 --> 08:53.938
Neither do l, but I'm definitely
a surprise of some sort to him.

08:57.027 --> 08:59.991
I should warn you, sir,

09:00.158 --> 09:03.833
my mother is a little... eccentric.

09:11.430 --> 09:15.105
Where is everyone? I hate that.

09:17.234 --> 09:18.444
Hello, Mother.

09:18.611 --> 09:22.035
Don't say it. Think it.
Use your mind, not your mouth.

09:22.912 --> 09:24.415
Hello, Mother.

09:24.582 --> 09:28.464
Deanna, shame.
What has this life done to you?

09:28.631 --> 09:32.347
No, don't tell me,
you're the Captain.

09:32.514 --> 09:35.478
Deanna explained
your telepathic abilities.

09:35.645 --> 09:38.193
That wasn't telepathy,
just common sense.

09:38.359 --> 09:40.823
Who else would they send
but the Captain?

09:40.990 --> 09:42.701
You may carry my luggage.

09:42.869 --> 09:43.786
Mother!

09:44.413 --> 09:46.125
No, that's quite alright.

09:46.292 --> 09:50.175
I'm indebted to your mother
for the fine counsellor she...

09:54.225 --> 09:55.393
This way.

10:04.203 --> 10:05.789
It's inappropriate...

10:05.957 --> 10:08.336
Yes, you seem to be struggling.

10:08.503 --> 10:10.799
A man your age must keep in shape.

10:10.967 --> 10:13.096
Mother, I won't go another step.

10:13.263 --> 10:16.227
A starship has its customs,
just as we do.

10:18.064 --> 10:21.195
If you're my mother's valet,
then please valet.

10:21.362 --> 10:24.368
Don't let me keep you
from your duty.

10:24.535 --> 10:26.664
I apologize for her behaviour.

10:26.831 --> 10:29.545
- You've embarrassed your Captain.
- No.

10:29.712 --> 10:33.386
Anything to avoid a quarrel
on this occasion.

10:33.553 --> 10:37.477
It's amazing how your accent
reminds me of your father.

10:37.644 --> 10:40.901
Your last valet
tried to rid me of it.

10:41.068 --> 10:42.905
What happened to Mr. Xelo?

10:43.072 --> 10:46.997
I had to terminate his employment.
Xelo was attracted to me.

10:47.164 --> 10:49.961
His thoughts
became truly pornographic.

10:52.132 --> 10:55.639
The thoughts of Wyatt's father
were almost as vulgar.

10:55.805 --> 10:59.146
- But he doesn't have...
- Passenger accommodation.

10:59.313 --> 11:01.985
He doesn't have Xelo's imagination.

11:02.152 --> 11:06.827
Between him and that woman's inane
chatter, it's a wonder I made it.

11:06.995 --> 11:10.669
- How do you like the Millers?
- Very pleasant...

11:10.835 --> 11:15.804
It's shocking how they've changed
since my husband and I knew them.

11:15.971 --> 11:18.977
It's probably because
I've grown beyond them.

11:19.144 --> 11:23.653
You realize that with Betazoids,
our ability to read thoughts

11:23.820 --> 11:27.119
does see us grow faster
than the typical plodding human.

11:27.286 --> 11:28.746
Mother, that's enough!

11:29.373 --> 11:32.462
So, you're not
totally out of practice.

11:32.629 --> 11:34.591
Good. Very good.

11:39.810 --> 11:41.939
We hope you find this comfortable.

11:42.107 --> 11:48.411
Yes. The room is adequate.
Small, but adequate.

11:48.578 --> 11:52.084
You will adjust the temperature
to a civilized level?

11:53.171 --> 11:54.840
I'll see what I can do.

11:55.007 --> 11:59.725
Now, if you will excuse me, I'm sure
you have much to talk about.

11:59.892 --> 12:02.564
Yes, Captain. You may go.

12:09.244 --> 12:14.296
You've been slack, little one,
allowed your mental powers to rust.

12:14.880 --> 12:17.009
Only to avoid confusion, Mother.

12:17.177 --> 12:20.558
Humans constantly think one thing
and say another.

12:21.142 --> 12:23.105
They do, don't they? Poor dears.

12:23.272 --> 12:26.069
Our style of complete honesty
frightens them.

12:26.988 --> 12:29.326
On that subject, Mother,

12:29.493 --> 12:33.376
there is such a thing
as too much honesty with humans.

12:33.543 --> 12:37.551
If they'd only say what they think
instead of hiding it.

12:37.718 --> 12:42.644
A shipload of such inconsistency
could drive one insane.

12:44.147 --> 12:50.243
Darling, I'm terribly sorry about
what happened here. Truly I am.

12:50.410 --> 12:54.208
Steven Miller tracked me down
and reminded me of our vows.

12:54.376 --> 13:00.012
Mother, I'm having trouble believing
in those vows as once I did.

13:00.179 --> 13:01.682
Deanna.

13:01.849 --> 13:07.026
But I'll honour them, of course.
I'm a Betazoid.

13:08.571 --> 13:11.744
You may find Wyatt an unusual person.

13:11.911 --> 13:14.750
I've sensed
remarkable depths in him.

13:19.217 --> 13:21.430
Message coming in from Haven.

13:21.597 --> 13:22.974
On screen.

13:25.020 --> 13:29.696
I'm Valeda Innis, First Electorine
of Haven. Capt Picard?

13:30.365 --> 13:32.577
Greetings, Electorine. I'm Picard.

13:33.996 --> 13:37.879
Your presence honours us,
and your timing's fortuitous.

13:38.046 --> 13:39.173
In what way?

13:39.341 --> 13:43.975
An incoming vessel has bypassed
our star gate, violating our law.

13:44.142 --> 13:46.856
It has refused
any attempt at communication.

13:47.022 --> 13:52.367
- Do you believe it to be hostile?
- Not communicating is hostile.

13:52.534 --> 13:55.330
We have no defensive capabilities.

13:55.498 --> 13:57.669
Our treaty with the Federation

13:57.836 --> 14:00.800
specifies your obligations
in that matter.

14:00.967 --> 14:05.602
Agreed. But let's hope
it doesn't become a defence matter.

14:05.769 --> 14:09.860
Of course, Captain, but I am
very happy we have you here.

14:16.331 --> 14:17.793
Come in.

14:24.848 --> 14:28.355
I wanted to apologize
for my mother's behaviour.

14:28.523 --> 14:31.402
Your mother's honest.
I respect that.

14:31.570 --> 14:34.535
Yes. She never lets up.

14:35.829 --> 14:39.920
I'll admit,
her honesty is a bit persistent.

14:40.087 --> 14:45.640
I never heard it described better.
But it is a Betazoid trait.

14:48.478 --> 14:50.942
I'll try to be only half as annoying.

14:51.109 --> 14:54.867
Let's see...
What can I tell you about myself?

14:55.033 --> 14:58.290
I'm a medical doctor,
for what that's worth.

14:58.749 --> 14:59.918
Doctor?

15:00.169 --> 15:03.008
If you were sensing my thoughts,
you'd know.

15:03.175 --> 15:06.431
- You can do that, can't you?
- Sometimes.

15:08.143 --> 15:10.857
This must be
what Mother felt about you.

15:12.359 --> 15:14.865
We could read each other eventually.

15:15.032 --> 15:18.706
- Can I take that as a compliment?
- Absolutely.

15:19.666 --> 15:21.670
I only ever felt this...

15:23.633 --> 15:27.306
..well,
with someone who's on this ship.

15:29.603 --> 15:33.568
- Do I have competition?
- No.

15:34.445 --> 15:38.370
What he wants most
is to captain a starship.

15:39.706 --> 15:42.461
What I want is to cure people.

15:43.046 --> 15:48.808
Well, I'm a practising psychologist.
Maybe we could work in concert.

15:49.935 --> 15:52.189
We are going to be together
a long time.

15:53.901 --> 15:57.449
Yes. That is the point
of marriage, I suppose.

15:59.746 --> 16:03.211
I really thought
you'd tell me you were an artist.

16:05.382 --> 16:08.221
I just felt your mind
very much on these.

16:08.723 --> 16:10.727
They are your work, aren't they?

16:11.644 --> 16:14.483
I can see that it'll be hard
to keep secrets from you.

16:17.908 --> 16:21.497
This is why you were surprised
when you first saw me.

16:21.664 --> 16:22.876
This woman.

16:24.170 --> 16:26.717
You thought I would be this woman.

16:29.597 --> 16:31.476
I have seen this face...

16:32.603 --> 16:34.733
..ever since I was a boy.

16:37.363 --> 16:42.874
When I closed my eyes at night,
I could hear her whispering my name.

16:45.254 --> 16:46.966
Knowing you were Betazoid,

16:47.132 --> 16:50.639
I assumed it was you
projecting yourself into my mind.

16:54.146 --> 16:57.486
- I'm sorry I'm not what you wished.
- No.

17:00.075 --> 17:04.083
Please don't mistake a childish
fantasy for disappointment.

17:04.250 --> 17:07.714
You are so beautiful.
I feel honoured.

17:17.192 --> 17:21.034
- You've no idea who she is?
- It doesn't really matter now.

17:30.552 --> 17:32.097
Captain's personal log.

17:32.306 --> 17:35.812
I trust my concern over
the problems of Counsellor Troi

17:35.980 --> 17:39.695
are not based merely on losing
a highly valuable crew member.

17:39.862 --> 17:43.954
But I feel that she's trapped
by a custom of her world

17:44.121 --> 17:48.338
which 24th-century life
has made unwise and unworkable.

17:49.131 --> 17:50.717
I wish I could intervene.

17:53.390 --> 17:55.018
On the viewer, Captain.

17:55.185 --> 18:00.737
Unidentified vessel travelling
at sub warp speed, bearing 235.7.

18:01.656 --> 18:04.161
Sub warp?
It's several hours away, then.

18:05.539 --> 18:08.211
Let's take a look.
Enlarge to maximum.

18:08.545 --> 18:10.549
Increasing magnification, sir.

18:15.225 --> 18:17.896
Mr. Data, is that the trouble
I believe it is?

18:18.898 --> 18:23.658
If you mean a Tarellian vessel,
sir,... it is.

18:26.330 --> 18:29.670
Aren't the Tarellians all dead?
What are they doing here?

18:29.837 --> 18:32.676
Picard to sickbay.
Dr. Crusher to bridge, urgent.

18:36.100 --> 18:40.609
They must not be permitted
to destroy us. Or the planet.

18:44.033 --> 18:45.702
Captain's log supplemental.

18:45.869 --> 18:48.958
It has been believed
the Tarellian race was extinct,

18:49.126 --> 18:55.012
an assumption contradicted by one
of their vessels approaching Haven.

18:55.180 --> 18:58.395
Its present velocity
suggests a possible answer.

18:58.561 --> 19:00.982
A damaged vessel could explain it.

19:01.150 --> 19:04.782
Without warp speed,
it would take this long to get here.

19:04.949 --> 19:07.036
Go on with your briefing, Mr. Data.

19:07.204 --> 19:11.379
Tarella was Class-M, like Earth,
with similar humanoid life forms.

19:11.546 --> 19:15.595
Unfortunately,
hatred overpowered intelligence.

19:15.762 --> 19:17.433
There were hostilities?

19:17.599 --> 19:20.272
Between the inhabitants
of two land masses.

19:20.397 --> 19:23.945
One group unleashed a deadly
biological weapon on the other.

19:24.113 --> 19:26.159
In the end, both became infected.

19:26.367 --> 19:29.999
Makes one question
the sanity of humanoid forms.

19:30.167 --> 19:32.921
Can you identify
the origin of the infection?

19:33.088 --> 19:36.596
They had reached Earth's
late 20th-century level of knowledge.

19:36.763 --> 19:38.850
That's all you need if you're a fool.

19:39.017 --> 19:43.610
A deadly, infectious virus
which is not difficult to grow.

19:43.777 --> 19:48.203
We learnt the story in training.
Some Tarellians went to other worlds,

19:48.369 --> 19:51.250
but died along with
the populations they infected.

19:51.417 --> 19:53.630
It's well covered
in Academy training.

19:53.797 --> 19:56.511
Many tried to avoid civilized worlds,

19:56.677 --> 19:58.973
only to be hunted down and destroyed.

19:59.975 --> 20:02.523
It was believed
that the last Tarellian ship

20:02.689 --> 20:05.278
was destroyed eight years ago
by the Alcyones.

20:05.445 --> 20:06.280
Yes, sir.

20:07.198 --> 20:08.993
Exactly when will they arrive?

20:09.160 --> 20:12.376
Exactly 13 hours,
9 minutes, 22 seconds, 350...

20:12.543 --> 20:13.920
Thank you.

20:14.839 --> 20:17.386
Which creates
a difficult problem for us.

20:17.553 --> 20:20.099
Our treaty requires us
to protect Haven,

20:20.267 --> 20:24.149
and Federation policy requires
that we assist life forms in need,

20:25.067 --> 20:27.739
which must include the Tarellians.

20:29.869 --> 20:32.791
I shall want you
to help find answers. Thank you.

20:33.418 --> 20:37.593
However, there will be time
for a second, voluntary assignment,

20:37.759 --> 20:42.853
the pre-joining announcement
of Counsellor Deanna Troi...

20:48.406 --> 20:49.658
..and Wyatt Miller.

21:02.016 --> 21:05.690
We've talked it over,
and the ceremony will be tomorrow.

21:05.857 --> 21:09.907
And Captain, would it be possible
for you to perform the ceremony?

21:10.074 --> 21:12.496
Of course, if all parties request it.

21:12.663 --> 21:16.127
All parties do not request it.
It's out of the question.

21:16.294 --> 21:21.179
You are not practised
in the ways of Betazed joining.

21:21.346 --> 21:25.062
- That's quite true.
- So you are totally unqualified.

21:25.229 --> 21:29.112
He is qualified
to lead a traditional Earth ceremony,

21:29.279 --> 21:31.324
which is what this will be.

21:32.452 --> 21:36.627
I thought you had no sense of humour.
Earth wedding? Ridiculous!

21:36.794 --> 21:38.882
We live on Earth now.

21:39.048 --> 21:42.096
So that's why
you want that backward ritual.

21:42.263 --> 21:45.227
Terrible to see a woman
go downhill like this.

21:45.394 --> 21:47.356
- Mother!
- Downhill?

21:47.524 --> 21:52.033
The matter is settled.
Mr. Homn will conduct the joining.

21:52.910 --> 21:55.582
But... Homn can't even talk!

21:56.124 --> 21:58.963
No matter,
he is adept in sign language.

21:59.130 --> 22:00.550
The matter is closed.

22:00.717 --> 22:04.140
Who are you to tell us
what we should do?

22:05.100 --> 22:07.230
Your ignorance is astonishing.

22:07.396 --> 22:10.110
I am Lwaxana Troi,
daughter of the Fifth House,

22:10.277 --> 22:14.118
holder of the Sacred Chalice,
heir to the Holy Rings of Betazed.

22:14.285 --> 22:15.204
Who are you?

22:15.747 --> 22:19.212
It is a Starfleet tradition
that at social gatherings,

22:19.379 --> 22:21.174
disputes are not permitted.

22:21.341 --> 22:25.432
I hereby declare therefore
all disagreements resolved.

22:38.710 --> 22:43.343
A toast. To the young couple,
and their families.

22:43.510 --> 22:44.470
And?

22:45.222 --> 22:49.397
And may this union
be a productive one.

22:49.564 --> 22:50.692
Hear, hear.

22:51.026 --> 22:52.613
Cheers.

23:07.099 --> 23:10.314
Considering the rate
at which you imbibe, sir,

23:10.481 --> 23:14.155
is your lineage
at all mixed with human?

23:21.086 --> 23:25.469
Is it true, Captain, that there's
a Tarellian ship headed for Haven?

23:30.479 --> 23:34.070
- Yes, it is true.
- That's amazing.

23:34.237 --> 23:36.366
I've read everything about them.

23:36.533 --> 23:40.207
Virus analysis was my favourite
subject at medical school.

23:40.374 --> 23:43.296
Then I'd very much like
to confer with you.

23:43.463 --> 23:46.344
I'm pleased to have
a medical colleague on board.

23:47.973 --> 23:50.895
Yes, ma'am... Doctor.

23:51.981 --> 23:54.903
Would it be possible
to prepare medical needs

23:55.070 --> 23:57.241
geared toward the Tarellians' needs?

23:57.408 --> 23:59.537
Then beam it over to avoid infection.

23:59.997 --> 24:02.126
What do you think?

24:02.293 --> 24:06.634
It's a very considerate idea.
Our sickbay is at your disposal.

24:07.053 --> 24:08.638
Thank you.

24:12.730 --> 24:14.317
Mr. Data?

24:15.862 --> 24:16.654
Sir?

24:16.822 --> 24:19.660
You're circling the room
like a buzzard.

24:23.627 --> 24:27.969
Perhaps being human yourself,
you do not find them as...

24:28.136 --> 24:30.892
..intriguing as l.

24:34.565 --> 24:36.904
Must he do that?

24:37.071 --> 24:41.079
It is the Betazed way
of giving thanks for our food.

24:41.246 --> 24:44.837
You giving thanks?
Besides, you never did this before.

24:45.003 --> 24:49.888
I do it now.
Unlike some people, I am in growth.

25:01.286 --> 25:06.087
Victoria, I've forgotten
whether you enjoy pets or not.

25:06.922 --> 25:08.926
Love them, of course.

25:10.554 --> 25:12.057
Good.

25:21.952 --> 25:26.127
Gently.
Poor baby, did she hurt you?

25:30.928 --> 25:34.435
If you'll excuse me,
I'd like to spend time considering...

25:35.104 --> 25:36.982
..the Tarellian situation.

25:37.608 --> 25:40.656
- Yes, of course.
- Ladies and gentlemen.

25:49.298 --> 25:54.350
Mrs. Troi, I'm very interested in
the Betazed ceremony you mentioned.

25:54.517 --> 25:57.898
- Could you tell us more?
- I'd be delighted.

25:58.066 --> 26:02.658
It's an ancient ceremony, regarded as
the most beautiful in the universe.

26:02.825 --> 26:05.497
After the couple
remove their clothing...

26:05.622 --> 26:09.380
- Bride and groom go naked?
- All guests go unclothed.

26:09.547 --> 26:12.428
It honours
the act of love being celebrated.

26:13.763 --> 26:16.686
Don't worry.
Your body's not that bad.

26:17.146 --> 26:22.114
Besides, your husband quite likes
the idea of seeing me unclothed.

26:22.281 --> 26:23.116
Steven!

26:23.283 --> 26:26.080
You did know he's attracted to me?

26:26.247 --> 26:28.084
Untrue. I don't...

26:28.251 --> 26:32.176
Stop this petty bickering,
all of you! Especially you, Mother!

26:50.254 --> 26:52.925
Could you please continue
the petty bickering?

26:53.092 --> 26:54.971
I find it most intriguing.

27:25.782 --> 27:27.786
May I join you?

27:45.154 --> 27:47.033
I will miss you, Deanna.

27:48.118 --> 27:50.374
I'm no longer Imzadi to you?

27:50.540 --> 27:53.797
You taught me
that word means "my beloved".

27:53.964 --> 27:58.013
And the human heart is too small
to permit that feeling now.

27:58.180 --> 28:02.356
Have you discussed this with Wyatt?
I think you should.

28:02.523 --> 28:04.944
It's also damned unfair to me.

28:05.862 --> 28:08.284
I understand.

28:08.451 --> 28:10.455
I should've realized.

28:10.622 --> 28:14.254
Humans,
young human males particularly,

28:14.422 --> 28:19.180
have difficulty separating
platonic love and physical love.

28:20.057 --> 28:22.813
The problem is,...

28:22.980 --> 28:25.276
..Imzadi,...

28:25.694 --> 28:28.450
..l couldn't. Not now.

28:28.617 --> 28:31.789
Call it an old,...
an old Earth tradition,...

28:33.418 --> 28:36.549
..habit of the beasts, whatever.

28:37.384 --> 28:38.970
Hello, you two.

28:39.889 --> 28:43.730
- We were just talking about you.
- This is incredible!

28:43.897 --> 28:47.738
- Yes. And in that discussion, l...
- Actually...

28:49.199 --> 28:52.456
Bill was concerned
that you might be upset

28:52.623 --> 28:54.752
that I care deeply for him, too.

28:56.380 --> 28:59.637
You're the one
who wants to be a starship captain.

28:59.804 --> 29:03.937
I've heard that bonding would
complicate things in that case.

29:05.147 --> 29:07.987
To each his own.
Good luck with that ambition.

29:08.488 --> 29:11.786
And I very much respected
what you did tonight.

29:12.663 --> 29:14.290
All I did was lose my temper.

29:15.334 --> 29:17.338
- Excuse me.
- Of course.

29:17.798 --> 29:20.302
Running all this is a big job.

29:27.066 --> 29:31.074
In fact,...
you shamed them into compromise.

29:33.747 --> 29:38.422
So they've decided that the joining
will be half Betazed, half Earth.

29:38.590 --> 29:44.059
The Captain will do the ceremony
and Mr. Homn will be my best man.

29:44.225 --> 29:46.773
And we'll take half our clothes off?

29:48.150 --> 29:50.530
Some of us still go naked.

29:50.697 --> 29:57.795
You do, I do, your mother, my father,
but not my mother or the guests.

29:57.961 --> 30:02.470
Capt Picard will be very relieved.
How did you manage it?

30:03.097 --> 30:04.934
Your mother relented.

30:07.355 --> 30:12.365
And I caught my father practising
naked in front of his mirror.

30:26.978 --> 30:28.564
And so,...

30:29.692 --> 30:32.530
..a question
I should've asked before.

30:34.200 --> 30:38.918
Deanna, do you really want
to go through with this?

30:40.129 --> 30:44.012
Yes, I want to.

30:46.558 --> 30:48.980
I'm a very lucky man.

31:09.562 --> 31:10.982
Captain's log, supplemental.

31:11.149 --> 31:14.656
All attempts at warning off
the Tarellian ship have failed.

31:14.824 --> 31:19.040
They still refuse to communicate,
and I'm growing concerned.

31:19.834 --> 31:22.088
How do you know they're receiving us?

31:22.255 --> 31:27.223
Our sensors show a responder echo
on the frequency they once used.

31:27.390 --> 31:30.939
We have a message, sir,
coming in from Haven.

31:31.106 --> 31:32.692
On viewer.

31:34.362 --> 31:38.245
Captain, the plague ship
is approaching transporter range.

31:38.412 --> 31:40.124
We are aware of that.

31:40.792 --> 31:45.009
Do you realize they can turn our
wonderful world into a graveyard?

31:45.886 --> 31:49.767
Please, take action now
before it's too late.

31:49.935 --> 31:51.771
We recognize your situation.

31:51.939 --> 31:56.031
- Please destroy them now.
- We will not fire on them.

31:56.531 --> 31:58.118
You must.

32:00.498 --> 32:04.130
I'm certain I could disable
their ship with a phaser burst.

32:05.716 --> 32:07.720
And then, Lieutenant?

32:11.979 --> 32:14.192
They're within transporter range.

32:14.692 --> 32:19.536
Then we can't delay any longer.
Ready the tractor beam, Lt. Yar.

32:20.538 --> 32:22.792
Target the ship. Activate on command.

32:22.960 --> 32:26.132
- Tractor beam ready.
- Engage.

32:32.103 --> 32:33.730
Got them, sir.

32:33.898 --> 32:37.280
Are they secure?
Can they beam out to the planet?

32:37.446 --> 32:40.244
Negative, sir.
They can't leave that ship.

32:40.411 --> 32:45.588
I know they can receive us. They
can respond with lights if necessary.

32:45.796 --> 32:50.014
Unless they've all died and the ship
was brought in by automation.

32:51.016 --> 32:52.476
Captain.

33:18.362 --> 33:21.117
It's the woman in Wyatt's drawings.

33:29.842 --> 33:33.015
Captain's log, star date 41294.6.

33:33.183 --> 33:36.982
Orbiting Haven with a Tarellian
vessel locked in our tractor beam.

33:37.775 --> 33:41.241
Question. What strange
combination of circumstances

33:41.408 --> 33:45.291
has caused a woman from someone's
imagination to appear on the ship?

33:45.916 --> 33:50.175
Enterprise to Tarellian vessel.
Are you receiving us?

33:56.354 --> 33:57.940
My name is Wrenn,

33:58.108 --> 34:02.408
and before I enquire why your
tractor beam has trapped us here,

34:03.285 --> 34:06.374
is there one aboard your vessel
named Wyatt?

34:08.253 --> 34:10.466
Captain, I don't understand.

34:12.092 --> 34:14.097
It's astounding.

34:14.264 --> 34:17.813
Ariana was right.
He is here, daughter.

34:17.980 --> 34:21.571
Wyatt, you've come,
just as you promised.

34:22.657 --> 34:24.911
How could I be so accurate?

34:27.500 --> 34:30.172
Except for the dreams,
I've never seen her.

34:30.297 --> 34:35.224
Sir, our concern is with the threat
your vessel poses to the planet.

34:35.391 --> 34:38.938
If you still carry the infection
that destroyed your world...

34:39.106 --> 34:41.485
We still carry it, Captain.

34:41.652 --> 34:44.659
My daughter, l, all eight of us.

34:46.036 --> 34:48.792
- Eight?
- All of us that are left.

34:49.335 --> 34:53.092
The rest passed on during
the years it took to reach Haven.

34:54.387 --> 34:57.351
If you've come here
because of the legend

34:57.518 --> 35:00.983
about planet Haven
miraculously healing the sick...

35:01.150 --> 35:04.072
We don't ask to make contact
with those living below.

35:05.033 --> 35:09.041
All we ask is to be...
on the edge of some sea,

35:09.207 --> 35:11.671
an unpopulated island,
a faraway peninsula.

35:11.838 --> 35:14.677
This is not our planet, sir.

35:14.844 --> 35:18.352
But I will present your needs
to those who do govern here.

35:18.810 --> 35:21.858
Present the fact
that we intend to die here, Captain.

35:24.572 --> 35:31.461
And if we die while caged by
your tractor beam,... so be it.

35:45.196 --> 35:47.868
Wyatt,
how do you like my new hairstyle?

35:48.035 --> 35:50.707
It will look much better
when I'm naked.

35:50.874 --> 35:53.254
Can we talk about something serious?

35:53.422 --> 35:57.178
I'm always serious. Only my pleasant
nature makes it seem otherwise.

35:57.346 --> 35:59.266
Please, Mrs. Troi.

36:01.604 --> 36:03.650
Yes, that was puzzling.

36:03.817 --> 36:07.198
A woman from another place
who insists she knows you.

36:07.366 --> 36:10.748
- And...
- Who you've dreamed of for years.

36:10.914 --> 36:12.501
I was hoping that you...

36:12.668 --> 36:17.177
Fascinating, Wyatt, how easily
your thoughts come through.

36:24.567 --> 36:28.575
The answer to the puzzle
of Ariana and you is so simple,

36:28.742 --> 36:31.748
- it's too simple for most humans.
- Too simple?

36:32.123 --> 36:34.670
It's something
they know instinctively,

36:34.837 --> 36:38.970
but try to reject or build
complicated superstitions about.

36:39.931 --> 36:44.231
All life, Wyatt, all consciousness
is indissolubly bound together.

36:44.397 --> 36:47.070
Indeed,
it's all part of the same thing.

36:48.280 --> 36:51.370
Yes, I have wondered
if something like that...

36:51.538 --> 36:54.209
That weren't so.

36:58.092 --> 37:02.810
And no doubt so has Ariana, which
helped you two to make contact.

37:04.020 --> 37:07.695
Wyatt,
tell me something seriously.

37:09.447 --> 37:11.911
Which of these
would look best on me naked?

37:29.279 --> 37:30.866
Wyatt?

37:33.037 --> 37:36.251
- Are you feeling alright?
- Just wedding nerves.

37:36.418 --> 37:39.257
I'll take the supplies
to the transporter room.

37:39.424 --> 37:41.804
I'll notify the Captain
they're ready.

38:04.307 --> 38:05.601
Look at your father.

38:05.769 --> 38:09.819
He can't wait to strip off his
clothes for that barbaric ceremony.

38:11.656 --> 38:13.576
Please take care of each other.

38:22.928 --> 38:24.974
You are beautiful.

38:27.478 --> 38:31.153
But you looked the best of all
in the desert on the holodeck

38:32.530 --> 38:34.534
when we did this.

39:02.173 --> 39:04.386
You can put the supplies on the pad.

39:05.513 --> 39:07.851
Dr. Crusher had me
set the coordinates.

39:08.018 --> 39:10.231
All we need is the Captain's order.

39:23.674 --> 39:27.473
Captain, someone's transporting
over to the Tarellian ship.

39:27.640 --> 39:30.730
- Override.
- I can't, sir, it's too late.

40:16.822 --> 40:18.200
Hello, Wyatt.

40:21.790 --> 40:23.962
We always thought you were a dream.

40:26.258 --> 40:28.053
You're not surprised?

40:30.683 --> 40:32.353
Did you know I'd beam over?

40:32.895 --> 40:36.486
Once we saw you were real,...
we knew.

40:37.822 --> 40:39.075
You are a doctor?

40:39.242 --> 40:43.292
Yes.
I've brought medicines and supplies.

40:44.252 --> 40:47.759
And I knew you would be this brave.

40:59.282 --> 41:03.791
How could you let this happen?
My son, surrounded by those lepers.

41:03.957 --> 41:06.213
If I could've prevented it, I would.

41:06.380 --> 41:09.928
- Beam him back.
- He can never come back, Mrs. Miller.

41:11.807 --> 41:14.771
You may turn off your tractor beam,
Captain.

41:14.938 --> 41:17.485
We will not be going to Haven.

41:19.948 --> 41:23.288
We have... what we really came for.

41:24.416 --> 41:26.962
- Wyatt?
- Mother.

41:27.880 --> 41:32.724
Mother,... forgive me, but I must...

41:33.225 --> 41:36.857
I'm going to try to continue
the work to cure these people.

41:37.900 --> 41:42.201
And Wyatt will do it.
I've believed that all along.

41:44.037 --> 41:47.128
I knew I was coming to Haven
to meet my destiny.

41:47.837 --> 41:50.301
I thought it was to be with you,
Deanna.

41:51.720 --> 41:55.352
It was Ariana who drew me here.

41:56.563 --> 41:57.648
I'm sorry.

41:57.815 --> 42:02.825
Wyatt,... I'm happy for you,
and for Ariana too.

42:03.660 --> 42:06.333
You've done very well
for a human, Wyatt.

42:06.500 --> 42:08.086
Mother.

42:10.508 --> 42:13.764
Captain,... my respects.

42:13.931 --> 42:15.559
And mine, sir.

42:22.573 --> 42:24.159
Goodbye.

42:35.098 --> 42:38.772
Keep the chest.
You'll have use for it someday.

42:53.259 --> 42:58.269
Shame to waste the trip. Perhaps I
should stay and join with a new mate.

42:58.437 --> 42:59.188
What?

42:59.355 --> 43:04.699
Well, the Captain's highly attracted
to me, but he's a little too old.

43:04.824 --> 43:06.995
Perhaps I should choose... you.

43:07.413 --> 43:09.792
He has other obligations, Mother.

43:11.588 --> 43:13.717
Very well. It's his loss.

43:19.269 --> 43:20.856
Mr. Homn.

43:25.366 --> 43:27.787
Thank you for the drinks.

43:36.680 --> 43:40.353
Try and remember your heritage,
little one.

43:48.369 --> 43:52.962
Captain,... even Xelo
never had such thoughts about me.

43:53.630 --> 43:56.010
You may energize.

44:00.686 --> 44:04.151
That was meant as a joke, Captain.

44:05.278 --> 44:07.073
I was not amused.

44:08.827 --> 44:13.252
- Take us out of here, Mr. Riker.
- Aye, sir. Warp two, helm.

44:13.419 --> 44:14.923
Heading 57.

44:15.423 --> 44:17.511
Mark 319.

44:19.431 --> 44:21.645
Our destiny is elsewhere.

44:23.732 --> 44:26.738
But I'm happy that yours
is with us, Counsellor.

44:26.905 --> 44:31.831
Warp two, sir.
Heading 57, mark 319.

44:33.000 --> 44:34.587
Engage.
