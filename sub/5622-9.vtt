00:00.934 --> 00:02.534
<i>You're watching</i>
The Last Man On Earth.

00:02.536 --> 00:05.804
We were known as KWA,
Knitters with Attitude.

00:05.806 --> 00:09.141
<i>Catch all-new episodes Sunday.</i>
<i>And check out</i>
<i>our other Fox programs--</i>

00:09.143 --> 00:12.277
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,
The Grinder<i> and</i> Grandfathered.

00:12.279 --> 00:14.513
I'm a grand--
I'm a grandfather?

00:14.515 --> 00:15.714
<i>Only on Fox.</i>

00:18.118 --> 00:19.118
<i>Previously on</i>
The Last Man on Earth...

00:19.120 --> 00:20.953
Phil, I'm having
a friggin' baby!

00:20.955 --> 00:22.821
You have a nice day, you hear?

00:22.823 --> 00:24.790
TODD:
<i>Melissa and I just broke up.</i>

00:24.792 --> 00:26.892
Looks like it's just
you and me, bud.

00:29.029 --> 00:30.829
All right, everyone,

00:30.831 --> 00:33.632
I ho-ho-hope you're in
the holiday spirit. (chuckles)

00:33.634 --> 00:36.468
As you can see, I've been doing
a little bit of decorating.

00:36.470 --> 00:37.736
Not quite done yet.

00:37.738 --> 00:39.238
Don't judge it.

00:39.240 --> 00:40.706
Wait, there's gonna be more?

00:40.708 --> 00:42.141
(laughs):
Oh, yeah.

00:42.143 --> 00:43.475
What you're looking at

00:43.477 --> 00:46.245
is the decoration version
of Bruce Banner.

00:46.247 --> 00:48.914
But someone just
made him very angry.

00:48.916 --> 00:50.416
And over the next few days,

00:50.418 --> 00:53.218
he's about to become
the Christmas Hulk!

00:53.220 --> 00:54.987
What do you think so far?

00:54.989 --> 00:57.389
I think it's like Santa ate
the Rockefeller Christmas Tree

00:57.391 --> 00:59.258
and then took a big dump
on the walls.

00:59.260 --> 01:01.693
Gail...

01:01.695 --> 01:03.695
thank you.

01:03.697 --> 01:05.931
Of course, I didn't
do it all by myself.

01:05.933 --> 01:08.767
Christmas helper!

01:08.769 --> 01:10.502
Who, me?

01:10.504 --> 01:12.604
(laughter)

01:12.606 --> 01:14.773
♪ Oh, Tandybaum, oh, Tandybaum ♪

01:14.775 --> 01:18.210
♪ How faithful
are your branches. ♪

01:18.212 --> 01:20.612
(chuckles)
Merry Christmas.

01:20.614 --> 01:22.881
Okay, who's ready
for some Secret Santa?

01:22.883 --> 01:24.883
Yeah! Come on.

01:24.885 --> 01:28.120
All right, now,
in this Kris Kringle chapeau

01:28.122 --> 01:30.589
is the name of everyone
in the group.

01:30.591 --> 01:34.793
So, draw a name, and under
absolutely no circumstances

01:34.795 --> 01:37.629
are you to share it with anyone.

01:37.631 --> 01:39.364
TANDY:
Oh, hey, Phil!

01:39.366 --> 01:41.633
Just in time.
We're doing Secret Santa.

01:41.635 --> 01:42.801
Want to come
pick a name?

01:42.803 --> 01:43.869
Um...

01:45.572 --> 01:47.706
Okay, sure, yeah.

01:49.642 --> 01:51.810
All right.

01:51.812 --> 01:53.212
(Carol gasps)

01:53.214 --> 01:56.782
All right, now commit
the name to memory.

01:56.784 --> 01:58.784
Roll up your papers.

01:58.786 --> 02:01.253
Put 'em in your mouth
and swallow it.

02:01.255 --> 02:03.055
Seriously?

02:03.057 --> 02:04.423
Did I stutter, Melissa?

02:04.425 --> 02:06.492
Eat your goldarn papers!

02:06.494 --> 02:07.726
It's just rice paper, guys.

02:07.728 --> 02:08.760
It's no big deal.

02:08.762 --> 02:10.829
Don't be babies about it.

02:14.434 --> 02:16.768
Full disclosure--
it wasn't rice paper.

02:16.770 --> 02:18.070
(groans)
Carol!
Of course.

02:18.072 --> 02:20.405
All right, you guys,
let's do this!

02:20.407 --> 02:22.307
Off and running.
Whoever got me,

02:22.309 --> 02:24.176
I'd like to request
Jimmy Choo thigh-high boots,

02:24.178 --> 02:25.911
size six and a half.

02:25.913 --> 02:28.480
And I would like that
stricken from the record!

02:28.482 --> 02:31.917
Melissa, it's<i> Secret</i> Santa,
not Live-Out-Loud Santa.

02:31.919 --> 02:35.320
Hey, billion-dollar
spending limit, please!

02:35.322 --> 02:37.923
And watch out
for the strings outside!

02:41.828 --> 02:44.163
That was, like,
the literal version

02:44.165 --> 02:46.498
of<i> The Nightmare</i>
<i>Before Christmas.</i>

02:46.500 --> 02:49.801
Well, at least we have a little
undecorated oasis in here.

02:49.803 --> 02:53.438
Wuh-oh, this room's
looking a little naked!

02:53.440 --> 02:55.307
Carol, enough is enough.

02:55.309 --> 02:57.776
Even gorillas don't
have hair on their nipples.

02:57.778 --> 02:59.878
Yeah, but I bet
they wish they did.

02:59.880 --> 03:01.013
(sighs)

03:01.015 --> 03:02.181
Hey, everybody.

03:02.183 --> 03:04.349
Gail, hey.

03:04.351 --> 03:06.685
I was just gonna go shopping.

03:06.687 --> 03:08.720
Oh, you're going shopping?

03:08.722 --> 03:11.890
I was going shopping, too.
That's-that's so funny.

03:11.892 --> 03:13.992
I'm gonna, I'm gonna go
someplace different.

03:13.994 --> 03:15.894
Me, too.

03:15.896 --> 03:17.529
Hey, you guys, you know,

03:17.531 --> 03:19.364
I was thinking,
in the spirit of Christmas,

03:19.366 --> 03:21.667
maybe we should let Phil
move back into the house.

03:21.669 --> 03:24.369
I mean, he seems like
he's really sorry.

03:24.371 --> 03:25.904
No, absolutely not.

03:25.906 --> 03:28.140
Well, Gail, it's kind of
Erica's call, isn't it?

03:28.142 --> 03:30.809
Fine, whatever.

03:31.811 --> 03:32.811
Hot dog!

03:32.813 --> 03:34.146
I'm gonna go tell him the news.

03:34.148 --> 03:36.648
(jingling)

03:37.650 --> 03:39.851
Yuletide greetings, braheem.

03:39.853 --> 03:41.887
Ah, Santa's here
early this year,

03:41.889 --> 03:45.224
and he's got two huge lumps
in his big old Christmas sack.

03:45.226 --> 03:46.325
Hi, Tandy.

03:46.327 --> 03:47.593
So, gift number one--

03:47.595 --> 03:49.161
Santa would like
to formally invite you

03:49.163 --> 03:51.430
to move back into the house.

03:51.432 --> 03:52.864
Oh.
Yeah, that's right.

03:52.866 --> 03:54.233
That's cool.

03:54.235 --> 03:56.435
And gift number two--
stick out your hand.

03:56.437 --> 03:57.603
What?

03:57.605 --> 03:59.238
Come on, I want
that hand stuck out

03:59.240 --> 04:02.608
and I want it stuck out now.

04:02.610 --> 04:04.176
What?

04:04.178 --> 04:05.577
Really?

04:05.579 --> 04:06.878
Hey, you dropped
your Christmas present.

04:06.880 --> 04:08.347
Oh, God.

04:08.349 --> 04:10.682
Check this out. Okay, hang on.

04:12.118 --> 04:14.186
Hang on.

04:16.122 --> 04:17.756
It's Erica's name.

04:17.758 --> 04:20.859
I was a naughty little boy
and I didn't swallow my paper.

04:20.861 --> 04:23.095
(chuckles)
Don't tell Santa, okay?

04:23.097 --> 04:24.429
But I want you to have it.

04:24.431 --> 04:26.098
Okay.

04:26.100 --> 04:27.299
Okay.

04:27.301 --> 04:29.034
And, uh, whose name did you get?

04:29.036 --> 04:31.036
Yours.
Aw!

04:31.038 --> 04:33.605
I'm sure you would've gotten me
something very personal.

04:33.607 --> 04:35.140
Hey, you know what?

04:35.142 --> 04:37.643
The look on your face
when I gave you Erica's name?

04:37.645 --> 04:39.278
That's all I need.

04:39.280 --> 04:41.380
All right.

04:43.816 --> 04:46.318
"Oh, thank you
for your help, Tandy."

04:46.320 --> 04:47.786
"Oh, no, no, no,
no worries, Phil.

04:47.788 --> 04:49.655
No, no, no, you don't even
have to thank me."

04:49.657 --> 04:50.822
"Oh, no, no, Tandy,

04:50.824 --> 04:53.125
I would never dream
of not thanking you."

04:53.127 --> 04:55.394
Try to help someone.
He just doesn't get it.

04:55.396 --> 04:57.129
Friggin' turd.

05:03.670 --> 05:05.671
(scoffs)

05:05.673 --> 05:07.572
I see you looking at me, Terry.

05:07.574 --> 05:10.776
Yeah, judging me, right?

05:10.778 --> 05:12.144
Think I'm a big
disappointment, huh?

05:12.146 --> 05:13.345
Big loser?

05:13.347 --> 05:15.347
Well, you try it--
living in a pod for three years

05:15.349 --> 05:17.316
with nothing but a bunch
of worms, huh?

05:17.318 --> 05:20.252
Or-or you try watching
all your loved ones die

05:20.254 --> 05:21.586
from 200 miles up in space.

05:21.588 --> 05:23.121
How do you think
that'd make you feel, huh?

05:23.123 --> 05:24.690
Huh, Terry?

05:24.692 --> 05:26.124
Hmm? What?

05:26.126 --> 05:27.359
Nothing?
You got nothing to say, huh?

05:27.361 --> 05:28.493
Oh, no, of course not.

05:28.495 --> 05:30.629
Of course not, no, that's right.

05:30.631 --> 05:32.097
'Cause you're just a worm.

05:32.099 --> 05:35.267
Just a stupid little
useless worm,

05:35.269 --> 05:37.602
who eats his own turds.

05:37.604 --> 05:39.838
Yeah.

05:44.844 --> 05:46.945
What the hell?

05:46.947 --> 05:49.881
CAROL:
I call it Frosty's lair.

05:49.883 --> 05:52.718
It's where Frosty
comes to think.

05:52.720 --> 05:55.487
Do you love it?

05:55.489 --> 05:58.457
It's just...

05:58.459 --> 05:59.858
Thank you.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.860
(chuckles)
Now...

06:01.862 --> 06:04.363
I've got a bone
to pick with you.

06:04.365 --> 06:07.632
Do you know why
we do Secret Santa?

06:07.634 --> 06:09.034
For the presents?

06:09.036 --> 06:10.569
No, Melissa.

06:10.571 --> 06:13.638
We do it for
the surprises.

06:13.640 --> 06:17.409
In Secret Santa, you can't know
what you're going to get.

06:17.411 --> 06:19.978
Yes, it's scary.

06:19.980 --> 06:21.747
And, yes, it's reckless.

06:21.749 --> 06:25.317
You are on a high-wire act
without a net, sister.

06:25.319 --> 06:28.587
And there's no sexy fireman
to catch you when you fall.

06:28.589 --> 06:29.855
But you know what?

06:29.857 --> 06:33.091
That's what makes
you feel alive.

06:33.093 --> 06:35.927
So, no jibber-jabber
about who wants what

06:35.929 --> 06:37.262
and who's getting this.

06:37.264 --> 06:38.897
Not even with Todd.

06:38.899 --> 06:41.066
Todd and I broke up.

06:41.068 --> 06:42.334
What?!

06:42.336 --> 06:45.237
Did lovemaking
become a chore?

06:45.239 --> 06:47.239
No, it just,
it wasn't working out.

06:47.241 --> 06:48.874
We want different things.

06:48.876 --> 06:50.409
Come here,
you little Vixen.

06:50.411 --> 06:52.544
The reindeer,
not the whore.

06:52.546 --> 06:53.912
(both chuckle)

06:53.914 --> 06:57.048
Oh, Carol, really,
it's fine.

06:57.050 --> 06:59.251
Thank you, though.

06:59.253 --> 07:02.754
Honestly, I'm more
worried about Todd.

07:15.868 --> 07:18.437
Hey, everybody, look.

07:18.439 --> 07:20.539
I'm not one for speeches.

07:20.541 --> 07:22.307
I-I just want to
say I'm grateful

07:22.309 --> 07:23.608
to be back.

07:23.610 --> 07:25.310
And-and there's
one person

07:25.312 --> 07:27.379
in particular I want to thank.

07:27.381 --> 07:30.916
Uh, someone who never
gave up on me.

07:30.918 --> 07:33.084
Um, he had it
rough with me.

07:33.086 --> 07:34.186
'Cause I've been stubborn.

07:35.388 --> 07:36.822
He deserves all the credit.

07:36.824 --> 07:39.458
Because without him,
I wouldn't be here with you.

07:39.460 --> 07:42.160
So, I-I just want to say thanks.

07:42.162 --> 07:45.497
Thank you, God.

07:45.499 --> 07:47.899
(laughs)
Yes!

07:47.901 --> 07:49.067
Amen!
Amen!

07:49.069 --> 07:50.168
Praise his name!

07:50.170 --> 07:52.938
Praise the Lord, yes!

Phil? Hey, there.

08:10.924 --> 08:13.191
Just wanted to say
that was a great speech.

08:13.193 --> 08:15.961
You know, truly inspiring,
TED-quality.

08:15.963 --> 08:18.163
Um, didn't know
you were so into God.

08:18.165 --> 08:20.131
Well, I... I am.

08:20.133 --> 08:21.132
(laughs)

08:21.134 --> 08:22.467
Same here. Praise him.

08:22.469 --> 08:23.602
But, y-you know,
it's funny.

08:23.604 --> 08:24.870
'Cause you mentioning God

08:24.872 --> 08:26.538
kind of reminded me
of that poem,

08:26.540 --> 08:28.540
you know, about the footprints
in the sand.

08:28.542 --> 08:29.875
And for some reason,

08:29.877 --> 08:32.177
that reminded me
of<i> my</i> footprints in the sand.

08:32.179 --> 08:33.979
You know, the other night,
when, uh,

08:33.981 --> 08:36.047
I was, uh, dragging you

08:36.049 --> 08:38.149
and, uh, saving
your life and such.

08:38.151 --> 08:39.451
What are you doing here, Tandy?

08:39.453 --> 08:41.186
I'm here to save
your life again.

08:41.954 --> 08:43.154
Ah, what are you doing?!

08:43.156 --> 08:44.689
You got to catch that!

08:44.691 --> 08:46.458
It's the friggin'
Hope Diamond, dude.

08:46.460 --> 08:47.959
Whoa.

08:47.961 --> 08:49.961
Why don't you give
that little puppy to Erica?

08:49.963 --> 08:51.796
Yeah, well, I already have
a present for her.

08:51.798 --> 08:53.632
Trust me, she'll love this.
This will win her back.

08:53.634 --> 08:54.966
Just, please, Phil,

08:54.968 --> 08:56.801
Phil, please.

08:56.803 --> 08:57.903
Fine.

08:57.905 --> 08:59.337
Hey, thank you.

08:59.339 --> 09:00.805
You're welcome.

09:03.309 --> 09:04.910
"You're welcome"?

09:04.912 --> 09:07.579
Oh, he friggin'
flipped it on me.

09:27.767 --> 09:29.834
(groans)

14:31.204 --> 14:33.638
