15:01.856 --> 15:04.656
- LAST CHANCE.
RETREAT, OUTLANDER.

15:04.658 --> 15:08.326
- I GOT ENOUGH JUICE
IN MY RESERVE PACK FOR ONE SHOT,

15:08.328 --> 15:10.194
AND THAT'S ALL IT'S GONNA TAKE.

15:10.196 --> 15:13.063
I DON'T MISS.

15:13.065 --> 15:16.399
OK. THAT'S NOT
SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN.

15:16.401 --> 15:18.501
- RAAGH!

15:18.503 --> 15:20.569
RRGH! AAH!

15:20.571 --> 15:23.638
- AAH! OH!

15:27.243 --> 15:30.577
- I SHALL BE LEGEND.

15:33.481 --> 15:34.780
- GAAH!

15:34.782 --> 15:35.847
- OH!

15:35.849 --> 15:38.749
OOF! OH!

15:38.751 --> 15:42.719
WITCH! I NEED MORE POWER!

15:45.857 --> 15:47.857
AARGH! WHAT--

15:47.859 --> 15:50.492
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

15:50.494 --> 15:55.329
- I DO AS YOU COMMAND, MASTER.

15:57.433 --> 16:00.333
- [GROWLING]

16:07.909 --> 16:10.342
- RAAGH!

16:19.886 --> 16:23.287
- HAAH! AAH! UGH!

16:26.091 --> 16:28.624
RAAGH!

16:28.626 --> 16:33.295
OH, COME ON. COME ON.
DON'T GIVE OUT ON ME NOW!

16:39.001 --> 16:42.435
- HOME IS BUT A STEP AWAY.

16:42.437 --> 16:47.406
- NO. NOW I WISH HIM TO STAY...
TO BE DESTROYED.

16:47.408 --> 16:50.441
HRRGH!
- UH!

16:52.344 --> 16:54.311
AAH!

16:54.313 --> 16:56.980
AAH! AAH! AAH!

16:56.982 --> 17:00.917
AAAGH! AAAGH!

17:00.919 --> 17:03.052
UHH...

17:03.054 --> 17:05.721
UHH...UHH...

17:34.217 --> 17:34.715
UHH...UHH...

17:34.717 --> 17:36.249
- WELCOME BACK.

17:36.251 --> 17:40.119
- SARASIM. I'VE GOT POWER.
HOW DID YOU--

17:47.995 --> 17:50.628
BUT MY PROTOTYPE
DIDN'T EVEN WORK.

17:50.630 --> 17:55.832
- PERHAPS WE ARE NOT
SO PRIMITIVE, AFTER ALL.

17:56.801 --> 17:59.334
[BEEPING]

18:01.838 --> 18:03.170
- 7%.

18:03.172 --> 18:04.704
NOT MUCH, BUT IT'S GOOD ENOUGH.

18:04.706 --> 18:07.873
SARASIM, THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU NEED TO KNOW.

18:07.875 --> 18:10.275
KRALL, HE'S BEHIND EVERYTHING--

18:10.277 --> 18:12.810
THE ATTACKS, MY BEING HERE,
ALL OF IT.

18:12.812 --> 18:14.545
- THAT IS CLEAR TO US NOW.

18:14.547 --> 18:17.180
OUR SCOUTS BRING WORD
OF A TERRIBLE ARMY APPROACHING.

18:17.182 --> 18:18.915
HE LEADS IT.

18:18.917 --> 18:22.084
- AND IF WE'RE GONNA BEAT HIM,
WE'VE GOT WORK TO DO.

18:22.086 --> 18:24.920
- THEN YOU WISH TO STAY?

18:24.922 --> 18:27.222
- TRY AND STOP ME.

18:55.985 --> 18:59.152
SARASIM, IF THIS
DOESN'T GO WELL,

18:59.154 --> 19:00.753
THERE'S SOMETHING
I NEED TO TELL YOU,

19:00.755 --> 19:03.122
SOMETHING
I SHOULD HAVE SAID BEFORE.

19:03.124 --> 19:05.591
- YOU ALREADY HAVE.

19:16.336 --> 19:21.305
STAND FIRM!
THIS WAR ENDS TONIGHT!

19:21.307 --> 19:24.041
- [KRALL
LAUGHING MANIACALLY]

19:24.043 --> 19:27.243
[THUNDERING FOOTSTEPS]

19:29.580 --> 19:33.048
- HIDING IN THE SHADOWS?
ARE YOU A COWARD, KRALL?

19:33.050 --> 19:36.918
COME OUT AND FIGHT.

19:50.066 --> 19:51.665
- AAH!

20:09.684 --> 20:12.217
- [HISSING]

20:14.955 --> 20:17.989
- YOU. COWARD.

20:22.494 --> 20:25.961
- [GASP] SARASIM! SARASIM!

20:25.963 --> 20:28.463
- UH! OOH!

20:28.465 --> 20:31.032
- I MAY HAVE FAILED YOU
AS A HERO,

20:31.034 --> 20:33.934
BUT I WILL TRIUMPH
AS YOUR CONQUEROR.

20:35.304 --> 20:36.670
- HUH!

20:36.672 --> 20:37.937
AAH!

20:37.939 --> 20:41.040
- HUH! AAH!

20:41.042 --> 20:43.509
NO! OUT OF MY WAY!

20:43.511 --> 20:46.845
UH! UH! AAH! AAH!

20:50.250 --> 20:54.685
- NO! AAH! SARASIM! DON'T MOVE!

20:55.988 --> 20:58.888
[BEEPING]

20:58.890 --> 21:01.991
ONE SHOT, CYBORG.
MAKE IT COUNT.

21:01.993 --> 21:05.260
NOOOOOO!

21:10.032 --> 21:11.765
OH!

21:11.767 --> 21:14.000
- I THINK IT WORKED.

21:14.002 --> 21:15.468
- CYBORG?

21:15.470 --> 21:19.404
- SARASIM! NO!
SEND ME BACK.

21:19.406 --> 21:21.773
- CYBORG, IT IS US,
YOUR FRIENDS.

21:21.775 --> 21:22.974
YOU ARE HOME.

21:22.976 --> 21:26.043
- THE VILLAGE,
IT'S UNDER ATTACK.
THEY NEED ME.

21:26.045 --> 21:28.712
- IT WAS KIND OF
A ONE-WAY DEAL.

21:28.714 --> 21:31.848
- BESIDES, DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW HARD IT IS TO LOCK

21:31.850 --> 21:35.084
ON YOUR SONIC CANNON'S FREQUENCY
FROM 5,000 YEARS AWAY?

21:35.086 --> 21:38.287
- I MADE A PROMISE.
THEY WERE COUNTING ON ME.

21:38.289 --> 21:41.323
- CYBORG, I'M SORRY.
WE HAD NO IDEA.

21:41.325 --> 21:45.293
- I DIDN'T EVEN
GET TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

21:49.132 --> 21:51.298
WELCOME TO THE FUTURE.

21:57.338 --> 21:59.805
- I HAVE SOMETHING TO SHOW YOU.

22:02.676 --> 22:07.611
- SARASIM. SHE DID IT. THEY WON.

22:07.613 --> 22:12.781
- APPARENTLY, THEY HAD HELP.
THAT'S YOU, ISN'T IT?

22:12.783 --> 22:16.551
INTERESTING.
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WITHOUT ARMOR.

22:16.553 --> 22:19.320
- YEAH. DIDN'T NEED IT.
