It's called

No, she did not,

dig out the bullet first

07:31.991 --> 07:33.892
So we could get started
on ballistics?

I think there might be something
trapped in the wound.

Well, there's definitely
a bullet trapped in the skull.

It'd be good
to look at that bullet.

Society is slow to change,

08:56.045 --> 08:57.412
Mm.

of those chicks in my household?

Yeah, sure.
I'll call you later.

09:08.256 --> 09:11.057
Or...Uh...

09:11.092 --> 09:12.892
Maura, have you seen
the new break room?

09:12.927 --> 09:14.060
It's
the old break room.

09:14.095 --> 09:16.864

all the old stuff --

09:20.035 --> 09:21.836

09:21.870 --> 09:24.538
You have your own refrigerator.
Impressive.

09:24.572 --> 09:25.873
Okay, what did you want
to talk to me about?

09:25.941 --> 09:28.709
Could you ever be married
to a caretaker?

09:28.744 --> 09:31.612
And this is a pressing question
because...

09:31.647 --> 09:34.048
Oh, I was just thinking
about you and Casey.

09:34.082 --> 09:35.282
Well, stop.

09:35.350 --> 09:37.384
I haven't heard from that guy
in three months.

09:37.452 --> 09:40.354
Plus, I don't really think
he's the househusband type.

09:40.388 --> 09:43.223
Probably just fell in love
with his nurse

09:43.257 --> 09:44.458
Or physical therapist.

09:44.559 --> 09:47.894
Very common.

09:47.928 --> 09:49.195
I know
what you're doing.

09:49.230 --> 09:51.798
I don't know
what you're talking about.

Misery loves company.

09:55.436 --> 09:57.070

09:57.104 --> 09:58.905
I hate
seeing you so sad,

09:58.939 --> 10:00.540
And whatever
you're feeling,

10:00.575 --> 10:02.309
It's okay to feel it,
all right?

10:02.343 --> 10:04.145
Just say it.

10:04.179 --> 10:05.680
Okay.

10:08.417 --> 10:09.884
I did want
a fruit basket.

10:09.919 --> 10:10.952
Yes.

10:10.986 --> 10:12.787
I did, and it should have had
D'Anjou pears

10:12.822 --> 10:15.089
And -- and --
and a nice prosecco

10:15.124 --> 10:17.825
And gourmet chocolates
and spa stuff.

10:17.893 --> 10:20.261
So pick up the phone
and tell her.

10:20.295 --> 10:21.563
I can't.

10:21.597 --> 10:24.466
Maura, okay, look.

10:24.500 --> 10:29.771
It is okay for you to want
a relationship with your mom.

10:29.805 --> 10:31.639
You'd be even weirder
than you are

10:31.673 --> 10:34.241
If you didn't want to know
your biological mother.

10:34.308 --> 10:37.711
<i>Okay, so, now I am
a whiny, weird pain in the ass.</i>

10:38.746 --> 10:40.380
I'm trying to be patient.

10:40.414 --> 10:42.014
That must be very hard
for you.

10:42.049 --> 10:43.082
It is!

10:43.116 --> 10:44.617
Well,
I'd at least like to know

10:44.651 --> 10:46.485
If Cailin
is taking care of my kidney.

10:46.520 --> 10:48.086
Well, so, what?
You want to spy on your kidney?

10:48.121 --> 10:49.387
Susie: There you are.

10:49.455 --> 10:51.956
This is nice.

10:51.991 --> 10:53.158
What is it, Susie?

10:53.192 --> 10:54.459
I thought you'd like to know
that I was analyzing

10:54.493 --> 10:55.827
The stomach contents
from the victim,

10:55.861 --> 10:57.095
And I noticed
blueberries in it.

10:57.162 --> 10:58.163
Blueberries?

10:58.230 --> 10:59.664
I found blue chunks in vomit
at the scene.

10:59.698 --> 11:01.199
Yeah, I know that.

11:01.233 --> 11:02.634
I was analyzing that,
too.

11:02.668 --> 11:03.935
Did you compare
both the samples?

11:03.970 --> 11:04.970
Yes.

11:06.873 --> 11:07.940
So, Erica and her killer

11:07.975 --> 11:09.575
Both had the same batch
of blueberry waffles

11:09.609 --> 11:11.110
Two hours
before Erica was shot.

11:11.144 --> 11:12.377
Wow,
that is a huge break

11:12.478 --> 11:14.546
If we can figure out
who she ate breakfast with.

11:14.581 --> 11:15.814
I say it's the husband.

11:15.849 --> 11:16.983
He's got motive.

11:17.050 --> 11:18.083
Which is?

11:18.151 --> 11:19.518
He's fed up
with being a househusband.

11:19.552 --> 11:21.320
He was a big lawyer
when they met.

11:21.354 --> 11:22.555
<i>She worked for him.</i>

11:22.589 --> 11:24.189
Well, we could rule out
her staffers,

11:24.224 --> 11:27.159
And her opponent's
right there.

<i>Erica:
Thank you so much.</i>

11:40.539 --> 11:43.073
First thing he does is
go to his wife's office?

11:43.108 --> 11:44.675
He killed her
to take her seat?

11:44.709 --> 11:46.476
Let's go talk to him.
Take Frost.

11:46.511 --> 11:47.711
I want to go look
at the bullet fragments.

11:47.745 --> 11:49.045
Governor just called.

11:49.080 --> 11:51.248
And you know how much I hate it
when the Governor calls.

11:51.282 --> 11:53.416
Not only was our victim
a State Senator,

11:53.484 --> 11:55.552
Her father has friends
in high places,

11:55.620 --> 11:58.989
So let's get this shooter
as fast as we can.

11:59.023 --> 12:00.123
Yes, sir.

12:02.860 --> 12:05.729
I'll meet you
downstairs.

12:05.763 --> 12:07.697
Okay.

12:07.732 --> 12:10.500
I heard your mother was
at the parade with T.J.

12:10.535 --> 12:11.735
How's she doing?

12:11.769 --> 12:13.403
Why don't you call her?

12:13.438 --> 12:15.839
I mean, I'm sure
she'd love to hear from you.

12:15.874 --> 12:17.741
Well, I don't want
to bother her.

12:17.776 --> 12:20.144
She just watched a woman
get gunned down.

12:20.178 --> 12:22.012
She's already
pretty bothered.

12:22.046 --> 12:26.785
Well, tell her --
give her my best.

12:32.292 --> 12:34.960
Jeff: No matter what,
my wife's work will continue.

12:35.028 --> 12:36.795
She was committed
to all of you

12:36.863 --> 12:38.798
And to the people
of Massachusetts.

12:38.865 --> 12:40.533
Yeah, sounds
like he's running for office.

12:40.601 --> 12:42.702
Mm-hmm.

You were there.
Yes.

Jane Rizzoli.

12:47.074 --> 12:48.441
This is
Detective Barry Frost.

12:48.476 --> 12:49.909
We're very sorry
for your loss.

12:49.944 --> 12:50.877
Thank you.

12:50.911 --> 12:51.945
I'll do
whatever I can

12:51.979 --> 12:53.780
To find the people
who murdered my wife.

12:53.815 --> 12:55.282
Did she have
any enemies?

12:55.317 --> 12:56.550
Anyone
she was afraid of?

12:56.585 --> 12:59.354
Erica was pushing to pass
new environmental legislation.

12:59.421 --> 13:01.055
The bad guys
didn't like that.

13:01.090 --> 13:02.724
You think
that got her killed?

13:02.758 --> 13:03.691
Yes.

13:03.726 --> 13:05.894
I think
it was a fringe group.

13:05.928 --> 13:08.430
She'd always gotten
nasty letters, but...

13:08.464 --> 13:11.700
This felt organized.

13:12.869 --> 13:14.069
Did you call
the police?

13:14.103 --> 13:15.503
She didn't want to.

13:15.538 --> 13:17.939
Did she have a breakfast meeting
scheduled for this morning?

13:17.974 --> 13:19.240
No.

13:19.275 --> 13:20.842
You sure?
She left the house at 7:00.

13:20.876 --> 13:22.544
Well, she didn't get
to the parade until 8:30.

13:22.578 --> 13:23.778
Where was she
for 90 minutes?

13:23.812 --> 13:25.146
No idea.

13:25.214 --> 13:28.616
I handled
her schedule.

13:28.651 --> 13:30.318
All she had today
was the parade.

13:30.353 --> 13:32.187

stand for?

on Tuesday, June 11th.

last week.

13:43.300 --> 13:44.466
I don't know.

13:44.501 --> 13:45.801
Erica put it
in the calendar.

13:47.004 --> 13:48.838
Why weren't you
at the parade?

13:48.872 --> 13:50.106
One of us had to take
our six-year-old

13:50.141 --> 13:51.207
To his soccer game.

13:51.241 --> 13:53.609
Our children were
very important to us.

13:53.644 --> 13:55.811
We didn't want them
to have the childhood Erica had.

13:55.846 --> 13:57.179
We were campaign kids.

13:57.214 --> 14:00.015
We spent every spare minute
with my dad.

14:00.049 --> 14:02.618
We got to do sports,
though.

14:02.685 --> 14:05.620
She was a great skier.

to collect her computer.

Uh, excuse me,
Mr. Miller.

14:18.833 --> 14:20.501
Uh, where was
your son's soccer game?

14:20.569 --> 14:21.736
Breed's park.

14:21.770 --> 14:23.204
That's not far
from the parade.

14:23.238 --> 14:25.039
What's that
supposed to mean?

14:25.073 --> 14:26.707
I didn't shoot my wife.

14:26.742 --> 14:28.143
We found some evidence
at the scene.

14:28.177 --> 14:29.177
Well,
check with the other parents.

14:29.212 --> 14:30.145
They'll confirm my alibi.

you don't have any,

is good.

Erica's credit cards.

She didn't use them
today.

18:46.937 --> 18:48.804
The only calls she made were
to her husband and her sister.

What about
the bullet fragments?

18:50.240 --> 18:51.674

it's because of that necklace --

36:23.947 --> 36:26.349
It looks like the grant money
was supposed to fund

36:26.383 --> 36:28.117
Environmentally friendly
practices.

36:28.152 --> 36:29.986
Hairy honeysuckle got
2 million bucks.

36:30.054 --> 36:31.187
Why am I paying taxes?

36:31.222 --> 36:33.289
So they can give them
to Bill Davenport?

36:33.357 --> 36:34.391
Does he look
like he needs the money?

36:34.459 --> 36:35.992
Well, it's used to pay
for safeguards

36:36.027 --> 36:38.161
Like showers
and air regulators,

36:38.196 --> 36:40.497
In addition
to disposable uniforms.

36:40.532 --> 36:43.768
Which they weren't using.

36:43.802 --> 36:45.503
What if they took
the government handout

36:45.537 --> 36:47.505
And then paid off an inspector
to look the other way?

36:47.539 --> 36:48.806
OSHA doesn't monitor
take-home toxins

36:48.841 --> 36:50.241
With inspectors yet.

36:50.275 --> 36:51.842
They rely
on outside regulators.

36:51.877 --> 36:54.678
Frost, scroll to the end
of that document.

36:55.947 --> 36:58.148
Look who was in charge
of compliance.

37:12.760 --> 37:13.860
You said you didn't know what THT meant.
I don't.

37:13.894 --> 37:15.028
Then I'll decode that
for you.

37:15.062 --> 37:16.129
It means
"take-home toxins."

37:16.163 --> 37:17.397
Malcolm: Where are we going
with this?

37:17.431 --> 37:19.732
You said you had a development
in the case.

37:19.767 --> 37:20.700
We do.

37:20.734 --> 37:23.669
These are straps
for a.22 caliber rifle,

37:23.737 --> 37:24.871
Aren't they, Jennifer?

37:26.306 --> 37:28.774
Erica and Jennifer were
both biathletes.

37:28.842 --> 37:31.644
What does this have to do
with my daughter's murder?

37:31.678 --> 37:33.546
Senator,
you need to hear this.

37:33.613 --> 37:35.815
Your résumé
on the Senate website

37:35.849 --> 37:36.916
Says you went
to law school.

37:36.950 --> 37:39.886
Doesn't say you failed the bar
three times.

37:39.920 --> 37:42.455
No husband, no children.

37:42.490 --> 37:44.924
Erica threw you a bone
making you chief of staff.

37:44.959 --> 37:47.928
Detective Frost,
please tell us what you found.

37:47.962 --> 37:49.930
The person who paid
"stop bad people"

37:49.964 --> 37:51.766
To harass Erica
used a pay service

37:51.800 --> 37:54.068
That hides
their customers' identities

37:54.102 --> 37:55.403
By sending the money
through a Boston bank,

37:55.437 --> 37:58.572
A Nashville bank,
and, finally, a bank in London.

37:58.640 --> 38:01.642
Those documents there
trace a transaction

38:01.676 --> 38:03.644
Right back
to your office computer.

38:03.678 --> 38:05.379
What?

38:05.447 --> 38:07.147
Malcolm:
What the hell is going on here?

38:07.182 --> 38:08.282
I think Jennifer knows.

38:12.420 --> 38:15.188
[ cheers and applause
in distance ]

38:17.192 --> 38:18.392
[ gunshot ]

38:20.027 --> 38:21.962
That's pretty cold,
Jennifer.

38:22.029 --> 38:24.830
We found gun oil
inside the baby's backpack...

38:24.865 --> 38:27.399
And what's left
of a blueberry waffle.

38:27.434 --> 38:29.168
Three months ago,
Erica started testing

38:29.202 --> 38:30.802
The water and the soil
in Readville

38:30.837 --> 38:32.304
Because the children
were so sick,

38:32.338 --> 38:34.105
But the water was fine,
the soil was fine,

38:34.140 --> 38:35.673
So it didn't make
any sense...

38:35.741 --> 38:37.241
Unless the toxins
were coming

38:37.276 --> 38:38.910
From the only new thing
in town --

38:38.944 --> 38:40.578
The honeysuckle
battery factory.

38:40.613 --> 38:42.947
Malcolm: Oh, no, no, no, no.
That's not possible.

38:42.982 --> 38:46.817
Erica got them a $2 million
grant to prevent that.

38:46.885 --> 38:48.185
I bet it was hard for Erica
to believe

38:48.219 --> 38:49.319
That her little sister
would take a bribe

38:49.354 --> 38:50.788
And let children die.

38:52.524 --> 38:55.659
"deliver GBS."

38:55.693 --> 38:57.394
Tell your father,
Jennifer.

38:57.495 --> 38:58.796
What did that mean?

39:01.266 --> 39:02.833
Jennifer: It meant...

39:02.868 --> 39:06.203
Deliver goodbye speech.

39:06.271 --> 39:07.538
Oh, my God.

39:07.573 --> 39:10.708
Erica was gonna resign
and expose you,

39:10.742 --> 39:13.110
And I'll bet she was even gonna
take the responsibility

39:13.145 --> 39:15.479
And clean up the environmental
mess that you made.

39:15.513 --> 39:16.947
I want a lawyer.

39:16.982 --> 39:18.349
I bet you do.

39:18.383 --> 39:20.618
[ crying ]

39:25.358 --> 39:26.692
I'm sorry, Senator.

39:38.671 --> 39:41.207
At least her children
won't be orphans.

39:41.241 --> 39:43.642
Even more reason
to marry a househusband.

39:43.676 --> 39:45.644
I'm glad
I don't have a sister.

39:45.678 --> 39:48.647
Well,
Cailin's not gonna shoot me.

39:48.715 --> 39:53.251
You know, that motorcycle would
make a beautiful café racer.

39:53.286 --> 39:54.419
Come on.

39:54.453 --> 39:56.621
He's in the drug unit,
not the espresso unit.

39:56.656 --> 39:58.424
The Harley look
is passé.

39:58.458 --> 40:01.527
1960s British rockers
are back.

40:01.561 --> 40:04.630
Actually, café racer
could be a better cover

40:04.665 --> 40:08.001
For busting dealers selling
in clubs and colleges.

40:08.068 --> 40:09.035
I'm in.

40:09.070 --> 40:10.370
Can you get it running?

40:12.073 --> 40:16.710
Well, the intake vacuum pressure
pulls the fuel through

40:16.744 --> 40:18.745
And mixes liquid
with air

40:18.779 --> 40:23.283
Before it sucks it
into the combustion chamber.

40:23.317 --> 40:25.786
Mm. Go on.

40:25.820 --> 40:32.093
Violent explosion rams
the big piston down

40:32.127 --> 40:34.428
With great force.

40:34.463 --> 40:39.500
Long connecting rod forces
the crank pin into rotation,

40:39.534 --> 40:43.738
Which is
what you want.

40:43.772 --> 40:46.974
God, I would love
to have my crank pin rotated

40:47.009 --> 40:48.176
Right about now.

40:48.277 --> 40:50.312
I knew you'd miss him.
Mm.

40:50.346 --> 40:52.414
Okay, you guys are making me
really uncomfortable.

40:52.481 --> 40:53.581
[ both laugh ]

40:53.616 --> 40:55.150
Angela:
Oh, stop it, you big lug.

40:55.217 --> 40:57.118
You would not
have done --

40:57.153 --> 40:58.320
Oh. [ chuckles ]

40:58.354 --> 41:00.355
I didn't know
you were here.

41:00.389 --> 41:01.323
Cavanaugh: Hello.

41:01.424 --> 41:02.424
Hi, Lieutenant.

41:02.458 --> 41:07.362
We were just gonna
make dinner together.

41:07.396 --> 41:08.963
I hope
you two don't mind.

41:08.998 --> 41:10.031
No.

41:10.066 --> 41:12.267
No. How nice.

41:13.236 --> 41:14.236
Night.

41:17.907 --> 41:19.474
"night"?
What the hell?

41:19.542 --> 41:21.342
Shh!
They can hear you!

41:21.377 --> 41:22.944
I hope
they can hear me!

41:23.012 --> 41:24.178
They shouldn't be doing

41:24.213 --> 41:25.680
Whatever it is
they're planning to do.

41:25.747 --> 41:26.714
[ groans ]

41:26.748 --> 41:27.982
Frankie, go in there.

41:28.017 --> 41:29.284
<i>Me? I'm not going in there.
You go in there.</i>

41:29.318 --> 41:30.518
No.

41:30.553 --> 41:31.820
[ as Cavanaugh ]
hope you don't mind,

41:31.854 --> 41:33.521
I'm gonna toss your mother
around a bit, all right?

41:33.555 --> 41:34.589
[ groans ]

41:34.623 --> 41:35.623
Shh!

41:35.657 --> 41:37.124
Yeah, you know what?
I mind!

41:37.158 --> 41:38.459
We are minding!

41:38.526 --> 41:40.828
Toss? Them?
I can't. No.
