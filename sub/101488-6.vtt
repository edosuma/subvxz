WEBVTT

00:20.437 --> 00:22.564
<i>BOB:</i>
<i>All right.</i>

00:22.647 --> 00:23.940
Everything's ready for tomorrow.

00:24.024 --> 00:26.276
Ocean Avenue Business
Association Ocean Fest!

00:26.359 --> 00:29.237
-Oh, I can't wait.
-Right, so we're all prepped.

00:29.320 --> 00:31.781
And now you kids are going to be <i>pepped,</i>

00:31.865 --> 00:34.117
'cause I'm about to give
you kids a great pep talk.

00:34.200 --> 00:35.910
-Incredible start.
-Mm...

00:35.994 --> 00:37.871
I'm pretty fired up.
It's working, Dad.

00:37.954 --> 00:39.831
Great, I-I haven't really started it yet.

00:39.914 --> 00:41.624
-And you lost me.
-Now hold on.

00:41.708 --> 00:44.294
As you all know, Ocean Fest
is a big day for business.

00:44.377 --> 00:47.714
And crafts and drinking
and music and drinking...

00:47.797 --> 00:50.091
And middle-aged guys playing
steel drums in the street.

00:50.175 --> 00:52.719
Anyway, my point is there's
gonna be a lot of foot traffic,

00:52.802 --> 00:54.304
so I'm gonna need you guys to work ex...

00:54.387 --> 00:56.181
I think it's gonna
be bigger than ever this year

00:56.264 --> 00:58.475
'cause of the Creatures
of the Sea sculpture contest.

00:58.558 --> 01:00.685
-A sculpture contest?
-Yeah.

01:00.769 --> 01:02.771
All the businesses are making
sculptures of sea creatures

01:02.854 --> 01:04.564
to put in front of their stores.

01:04.647 --> 01:06.608
The prize is a $300 gift certificate

01:06.691 --> 01:08.109
to any store on the street.

01:08.193 --> 01:10.195
Even Mort's? Free funeral!

01:10.278 --> 01:12.197
Guys, we need to win this.

01:12.280 --> 01:14.199
Toys in the Hood is on Ocean Avenue.

01:14.282 --> 01:17.327
$300-- that could get us through
the rest of our childhood.

01:17.410 --> 01:19.120
We don't need to win
the sculpture contest.

01:19.204 --> 01:21.873
We just need to win at working good.

01:21.956 --> 01:24.042
But, Dad, my hands
were made for sculpting.

01:24.125 --> 01:25.752
And for going like this.
(snorts)

01:25.835 --> 01:27.212
I'm a little piggy.
(oinking)

01:27.295 --> 01:28.963
Okay, just one to ten more questions

01:29.047 --> 01:30.882
-about this sculpture contest.
-Mm.

01:30.965 --> 01:32.634
You don't have to worry about it
'cause I already made

01:32.717 --> 01:34.094
our sculpture.
Ooh, I'm gonna go get it!

01:34.177 --> 01:36.388
Great. Oh, okay, uh,
now back to my pep talk.

01:36.471 --> 01:38.640
-LINDA: Bob, do your pep talk!
-Yeah, I'm doing it, Lin.

01:38.723 --> 01:40.809
Tomorrow morning,
I need you kids to hand out

01:40.892 --> 01:42.519
these flyers for the restaurant.

01:42.602 --> 01:44.771
(singsongy):
It's a mermaid who loves beef!

01:44.854 --> 01:47.315
-Is that a used piñata?
-No, it's my sculpture.

01:47.399 --> 01:49.693
It's papier-mâché.
I made it last night.

01:49.776 --> 01:52.696
-Were you asleep?
-No. I maybe had some wine.

01:52.779 --> 01:55.365
Did you wake up next to it
in a pool of your own vomit?

01:55.448 --> 01:57.951
-No!
-Did you guys hear
what I said about the flyers?

01:58.034 --> 02:00.203
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
So that's definitely

02:00.286 --> 02:02.122
what we're entering
in the sculpture contest?

02:02.205 --> 02:04.541
-Hmm.
-Yes! She's pretty, isn't she?

02:04.624 --> 02:06.292
She's not conventionally attractive,

02:06.376 --> 02:07.794
but she has kind eyes.

02:07.877 --> 02:09.295
They're kind of eyes.

02:09.379 --> 02:11.047
And can we talk about
what color you painted her?

02:11.131 --> 02:13.008
And why it's off-putting?

02:13.091 --> 02:15.802
No, leave her alone.
Don't listen to them, mermaid.

02:15.885 --> 02:17.846
I just don't think it's gonna
get the judges' attention.

02:17.929 --> 02:19.806
Don't worry, I'll take care of it.

02:19.889 --> 02:22.225
Um, we don't need to focus
on the sculpture, okay?

02:22.308 --> 02:24.602
Ocean Fest should actually be
a good day for us.

02:24.686 --> 02:27.522
So I need you kids to not be horrible.

02:27.605 --> 02:29.941
I mean, I love you all,
but it'd be great if you

02:30.025 --> 02:32.861
could just not be like
how you are sometimes.

02:32.944 --> 02:35.405
I just really want to give
that mermaid a mer-makeover.

02:35.488 --> 02:37.741
-A merk-over.
-No, don't touch her.

02:37.824 --> 02:39.784
My sculpture's good.
She's beautiful.

02:39.868 --> 02:42.871
If you don't look at her face.
Sorry. She's really pretty.

02:42.954 --> 02:44.914
Hello, Bob.
Guess what time it is.

02:44.998 --> 02:47.584
-It's 3:45.
-Ron, I was doing a thing!

02:47.667 --> 02:50.295
-Oh, sorry.
-It's inspection time.

02:50.378 --> 02:51.963
-I was gonna say.
-Nice.

02:52.047 --> 02:54.382
Full disclosure: one booth
might have a booger under it.

02:54.466 --> 02:55.633
Don't ask me how I know.

02:55.717 --> 02:58.178
-Okay, that's enough.
-Thank you, Tina.

02:58.261 --> 02:59.971
This prep area is damp.

03:00.055 --> 03:01.348
I just cleaned it.

03:01.431 --> 03:03.141
That makes sense-- you look damp.

03:03.224 --> 03:05.101
These lettuce heads are stacked weird.

03:05.185 --> 03:06.519
Is that illegal?

03:06.603 --> 03:08.438
-No, it's... it's just stupid.
-Mm-hmm.

03:08.521 --> 03:10.023
What do we have here?

03:10.106 --> 03:12.067
-Rags?
-Wash... your...

03:12.150 --> 03:13.735
greasy... rags!

03:13.818 --> 03:15.695
Stop throwing them at me, Hugo.

03:15.779 --> 03:17.364
Also, you missed every time.

03:17.447 --> 03:19.074
-Good effort though.
-Hmph!

03:19.157 --> 03:21.618
Well, Bob, you passed. Barely.

03:21.701 --> 03:23.453
-That's our thing.
-Go, Dad.

03:23.536 --> 03:25.705
I guess you get to stay open
during Ocean Fest.

03:25.789 --> 03:27.665
You're a lucky little fishy.

03:27.749 --> 03:30.168
-Lucky little fishy?
-Forget I said that.

03:30.251 --> 03:32.045
I thought it would sound tough.
We're leaving!

03:32.128 --> 03:33.880
That thing makes me uncomfortable.

03:33.963 --> 03:35.674
-I made it.
-I love it.

03:35.757 --> 03:37.133
Come on, Ron.

03:38.176 --> 03:39.469
Please let tomorrow go okay.

03:39.552 --> 03:40.929
It'll be great.

03:41.012 --> 03:42.389
-I hope so.
-I know so.

03:42.472 --> 03:44.140
It's like I can see the future.

03:44.224 --> 03:46.726
You're there, you're looking
sexy selling burgers,

03:46.810 --> 03:48.561
-you have a cool tattoo.
-Wait.

03:48.645 --> 03:50.355
I have a cool tattoo tomorrow?

03:50.438 --> 03:52.148
-Yeah, of a sword.
-Of a sword?

03:52.232 --> 03:54.192
-Is that cool?
-You thought it was.

03:54.275 --> 03:56.152
Hey, don't worry.
Tomorrow's gonna be...

03:56.236 --> 03:57.737
it's gonna be good.

03:57.821 --> 03:59.239
-You're probably right.
-(snoring)

03:59.322 --> 04:01.825
And you're asleep.

04:06.287 --> 04:07.622
Linda. Linda?

04:07.706 --> 04:09.165
-Do you smell smoke?
-Yeah.

04:09.249 --> 04:10.583
What's burning?

04:10.667 --> 04:12.836
-Ah, it's probably nothing.
-(alarm ringing)

04:12.919 --> 04:15.839
BOB:
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

04:15.922 --> 04:18.341
-Oh, my God!
-Aah, my mermaid!

04:18.425 --> 04:19.759
No. Why?

04:19.843 --> 04:21.428
Oh, this is bad.

04:21.511 --> 04:23.054
Okay, uh, maybe it's okay.

04:23.138 --> 04:25.265
Uh, the-the fire didn't spread,
so maybe we can

04:25.348 --> 04:27.767
still open?
Yeah, it's not so bad out there.

04:27.851 --> 04:29.227
And we can cook in here, right?

04:29.310 --> 04:30.770
It <i>is </i>cooked in here.

04:30.854 --> 04:32.147
-What do you think started it?
-(clicking)

04:32.230 --> 04:33.732
I have no idea. Crap!

04:33.815 --> 04:35.066
The grill won't turn on.

04:35.150 --> 04:36.317
That's not good.

04:36.401 --> 04:38.319
-Mommy, Daddy?
-Yeah?

04:38.403 --> 04:40.864
I think I might know
what started the fire.

04:40.947 --> 04:41.990
-What?
-What, honey?

04:42.073 --> 04:43.867
Me.

04:46.327 --> 04:48.288
<i>BOB:</i>
<i>Gene, how could you have started the fire?</i>

04:48.371 --> 04:50.040
You were upstairs, asleep.

04:50.123 --> 04:52.125
It all began when Mom
showed us her weird...

04:52.208 --> 04:54.210
I mean, good and not weird sculpture.

04:54.294 --> 04:55.962
I couldn't stop thinking about the contest

04:56.046 --> 04:58.340
and how her mermaid would never win.

04:58.423 --> 04:59.966
And we'd never get to be up to our butts

05:00.050 --> 05:01.968
in toy gift certificate money.

05:42.384 --> 05:44.803
So, yeah.
I left Mom's old crimping iron plugged in,

05:44.886 --> 05:47.138
and I guess it set the restaurant on fire.

05:47.222 --> 05:48.973
I'm really, really sorry.

05:49.057 --> 05:51.518
Oh, my God.
That was not great of you, Gene.

05:51.601 --> 05:54.604
But it's gonna be fine.
But why did you do that?

05:54.688 --> 05:57.440
Terrible. Bad.
I mean, I-I'm glad you told us.

05:57.524 --> 05:59.025
But why did you do that?!

05:59.109 --> 06:01.194
Sorry. Sorry.
But it'll be okay.

06:01.277 --> 06:02.987
Maybe.
Probably not.

06:03.071 --> 06:04.406
Bob! Linda!

06:04.489 --> 06:06.700
Kids.
Oh, my God, Linda.

06:06.783 --> 06:08.868
-Give me a hug. Come on.
-No. Uh-huh.

06:08.952 --> 06:10.036
TEDDY:
I thought I lost you there, Bob.

06:10.120 --> 06:11.413
-Mm-hmm. Mm.
-Let me look at you.

06:11.496 --> 06:12.914
Kids, there you are.

06:12.997 --> 06:15.166
Linda, all the stuff
we almost never got to say.

06:15.250 --> 06:17.544
-We're okay, Teddy. W-Wait, wait, what?
-(panting)

06:17.627 --> 06:20.171
W-Wow.
You're breathing really hard.

06:20.255 --> 06:22.924
-I ran here.
-From your house?

06:23.008 --> 06:24.509
No, from my truck.

06:24.592 --> 06:26.302
It's, uh, parked out in the alley.

06:26.386 --> 06:27.929
I'm just in really bad shape.

06:28.013 --> 06:30.306
Well, thanks for coming.
Sorry we called you so early.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.308
We can't start the grill
and we were thinking maybe

06:32.392 --> 06:34.894
you could fix it,
like, really soon. Please?

06:34.978 --> 06:36.604
I don't want to let go.
I don't want to lose you,

06:36.688 --> 06:38.898
-you know? (crying)
-Uh-huh. I know.

06:38.982 --> 06:41.192
I know, but it-it seems
like it'd be hard for you

06:41.276 --> 06:43.611
to fix the grill
if you're also still hugging us.

06:43.695 --> 06:45.697
(shushes)
Just a little longer.

06:45.780 --> 06:47.157
<i>GENE:</i>
<i>I feel terrible.</i>

06:47.240 --> 06:48.742
Don't end up like me, you guys.

06:48.825 --> 06:50.368
I had so much promise.

06:50.452 --> 06:52.328
Yeah, yeah. Uh-huh.

06:52.412 --> 06:54.456
But you know, Mom and Dad, Gene actually

06:54.539 --> 06:56.750
kind of got me thinking about something.

06:56.833 --> 06:57.876
Yeah, honey? What?

06:57.959 --> 06:59.210
Just that I, um,

06:59.294 --> 07:01.379
also might have started the fire?

07:01.463 --> 07:03.006
-What? H-How?
-No.

07:03.089 --> 07:05.508
I shared Gene's opinion
that your sculpture

07:05.592 --> 07:08.928
was sort of unlikely
to win us any toy money.

07:09.012 --> 07:11.264
So, I, uh, snuck downstairs
in the middle of the night.

07:11.348 --> 07:13.516
<i>BOB:</i>
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

07:34.829 --> 07:37.499
<i>Anyway, I just shoved, like,</i>
<i>a bunch of them into the mermaid.</i>

07:51.262 --> 07:54.140
So, yeah. I feel like,
by bringing a bunch of sparklers

07:54.224 --> 07:56.518
into the restaurant, I maybe, potentially,

07:56.601 --> 07:58.186
contributed to the fire.

07:58.269 --> 08:00.146
(high-pitched):
Mm-hmm. Great. Yep. Uh-huh.

08:00.230 --> 08:02.982
She didn't need sparklers.
She sparkled all on her own.

08:03.066 --> 08:04.943
I'm sorry about the sparklers.
(scoffs)

08:05.026 --> 08:07.696
Let's go back to blaming
Mr. Crimping Iron.

08:07.779 --> 08:09.739
It's hard out here for a crimp.

08:09.823 --> 08:12.200
-I think I figured out what's wrong.
-What? What is that?

08:12.283 --> 08:14.411
It's your thermocouple.
It's why your grill isn't turning on.

08:14.494 --> 08:16.579
-Uh, the-the what-a-couple?
-Your thermocouple.

08:16.663 --> 08:18.998
It regulates your heat.
I think it got damaged by the water.

08:19.082 --> 08:21.334
-A lot of stuff did.
-Yeah, those fire guys

08:21.418 --> 08:23.044
went all Patrick Sprayzey in there.

08:23.128 --> 08:24.713
So, can we get a new one and install it

08:24.796 --> 08:27.007
-before Ocean Fest starts?
-I don't know. I'll try.

08:27.090 --> 08:29.426
Your grill is old,
so this might not be a standard size.

08:29.509 --> 08:31.928
I'll start calling around
and see if anyone has the part.

08:32.012 --> 08:34.848
-(groans)
-You figured it out, Teddy. Good job.

08:34.931 --> 08:36.850
Listen, Gene and I
haven't discussed this yet,

08:36.933 --> 08:38.476
but we're both willing to move

08:38.560 --> 08:39.936
our stuff out by the end of the day.

08:40.020 --> 08:41.479
We'll find a place to live.

08:41.563 --> 08:43.898
-Probably a nunnery.
-Or a Cinnabunnery?

08:43.982 --> 08:46.735
I, um, kind of need
to tell you guys something, too.

08:46.818 --> 08:48.028
Tina, no.

08:48.111 --> 08:49.362
-Yeah.
-No.

08:49.446 --> 08:50.989
Uh-huh.

09:12.969 --> 09:15.430
<i>'Cause, you know, oxygen and fire.</i>
<i>You-you do the math.</i>

09:28.651 --> 09:29.736
I'm really sorry.

09:29.819 --> 09:30.862
What is wrong with all of you?!

09:30.945 --> 09:32.072
Nope.
I didn't mean that.

09:32.155 --> 09:33.698
It's okay.
(sighs)

09:33.782 --> 09:35.450
Thanks, Tina, for telling us.

09:35.533 --> 09:37.369
So, it sounds like Gene started the fire

09:37.452 --> 09:38.995
with Mom's old crimping iron.

09:39.079 --> 09:41.498
Louise gave the fire fuel
with all of the sparklers

09:41.581 --> 09:44.084
and, Tina, you literally
fanned the flames.

09:44.167 --> 09:46.670
Aw, working together.
I mean, that's not good.

09:46.753 --> 09:48.672
Teddy, did you find
a new thermocouple thing yet?

09:48.755 --> 09:50.173
I called everybody.

09:50.256 --> 09:51.883
The closest I've come was
a restaurant equipment place

09:51.966 --> 09:53.635
called Chef Marks The Spot.

09:53.718 --> 09:55.845
But they sold the last one.
I said, "How could you do that?"

09:55.929 --> 09:58.139
They said, "Who are you?"
I said, "Who are you?"

09:58.223 --> 09:59.891
Aah!
I'll keep calling places.

09:59.974 --> 10:02.185
Our street is about to be full
of hungry Ocean Fest people

10:02.268 --> 10:03.395
and we can't feed them.

10:03.478 --> 10:04.854
W-We got to figure out a way to cook.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.690
We're gonna figure out a way to cook.

10:06.773 --> 10:07.899
Kids, go hand out flyers.

10:07.982 --> 10:09.526
So, the restaurant's open?

10:09.609 --> 10:11.820
It will be, 'cause it's Ocean Fest,
damn it.

10:11.903 --> 10:14.280
-Right, Bob?
-Yeah. I don't know how.

10:14.364 --> 10:17.367
And hopefully the restaurant
won't smell like it does now.

10:17.450 --> 10:19.577
But yeah.
Kids, go hand out flyers.

10:19.661 --> 10:20.912
It seems like the least we could do

10:20.995 --> 10:22.372
'cause of the whole fire thing.

10:22.455 --> 10:24.124
Unless you guys already forgot about that?

10:24.207 --> 10:26.543
-We remember.
-You got a good memory, Dad.

10:26.626 --> 10:29.004
-For your age.
-And a great ass.

10:29.087 --> 10:30.338
Thank you.

10:30.422 --> 10:32.507
LOUISE:
Guys, we're horrible.

10:32.590 --> 10:34.342
We set the restaurant on fire.

10:34.426 --> 10:36.678
-Yeah. Why are we so bad?
-I know.

10:36.761 --> 10:39.389
Aah! Damn it!
We're not even good at handing out flyers.

10:39.472 --> 10:40.765
We got to fix this.

10:40.849 --> 10:42.934
I mean, we can't
un-set the restaurant on fire,

10:43.018 --> 10:46.521
but maybe we can un-horrible ourselves
and help Mom and Dad.

10:46.604 --> 10:47.939
How?
We killed Dad's grill.

10:48.023 --> 10:49.399
He can't even cook.
He's useless.

10:49.482 --> 10:50.775
He's a sick joke.

10:50.859 --> 10:52.569
What if we get the thermocouple thing?

10:52.652 --> 10:54.863
We go to Chef Marks The Spot,
find out who bought it,

10:54.946 --> 10:56.406
and track them down.

10:56.489 --> 10:57.574
So, you in?
You in?

10:57.657 --> 10:59.200
You both are making faces like you're in.

10:59.284 --> 11:01.327
I have resting in face.
But yeah, I'm in.

11:01.411 --> 11:02.704
-Tina?
-I'm in.

11:02.787 --> 11:05.165
All right.
Operation un-horrible ourselves is a go.

11:05.248 --> 11:08.084
Steel Songnolias, wait for me.

11:12.172 --> 11:13.673
<i>BOB:</i>
<i>All right, thanks.</i>
I'll-I'll be right there.

11:13.757 --> 11:15.884
Tell, uh, tell it I'm coming.
That was the rental place.

11:15.967 --> 11:17.469
They have a portable grill we can rent.

11:17.552 --> 11:19.012
I can go pick it up right now.

11:19.095 --> 11:20.680
Oh, we have so much cleaning to do here.

11:20.764 --> 11:22.390
-Hey, I can pick it up.
-Uh, really?

11:22.474 --> 11:23.808
Yeah, 'cause otherwise
you'd probably want me

11:23.892 --> 11:25.477
to clean this place, and it's a mess.

11:25.560 --> 11:27.937
-It really is.
-Yep. So, bye.

11:28.021 --> 11:29.314
Wait.
Where am I going?

11:29.397 --> 11:30.982
The catering rental place, Teddy.
Supplies Party.

11:31.066 --> 11:32.400
You think they'll be all right

11:32.484 --> 11:34.027
with a guy in pajamas and slippers?

11:34.110 --> 11:35.904
-I think they'll like it.
-Great.

11:35.987 --> 11:37.697
LINDA:
Yoo-hoo!

11:37.781 --> 11:39.324
-Bob, what do you think?
-Aah!

11:39.407 --> 11:41.409
-I've been fixing her up.
-You gave it teeth?

11:41.493 --> 11:43.119
Yeah.
She's smiling.

11:43.203 --> 11:44.871
She's saying, "I'm okay. I'm alive."

11:44.954 --> 11:47.123
I got to go put it out in front.

11:48.375 --> 11:51.378
-Perfect.
-Oh, great, Jimmy's coming over.

11:51.461 --> 11:53.463
Whoa-oh-oh!
Hey, I heard you had a fire this morning.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.215
Good thing no one's ever in there,

11:55.298 --> 11:57.467
or somebody could've gotten hurt. Zoom!

11:57.550 --> 11:59.511
Good one, Jimmy-- if it's Opposite Day

11:59.594 --> 12:01.513
and good ones are bad ones.

12:01.596 --> 12:03.264
-(quietly): Nice, Bob.
-Oof.

12:03.348 --> 12:05.684
-What the hell is that thing?
-It's a very brave mermaid

12:05.767 --> 12:07.268
with an incredible story,

12:07.352 --> 12:08.895
and a smile that lights up a room.

12:08.978 --> 12:10.939
Hey, you want to see a sculpture?
Look at mine.

12:11.022 --> 12:12.816
It's Trev.
I put a bunch of seaweed on him.

12:12.899 --> 12:14.192
He's, like, a creature thing.

12:14.275 --> 12:16.194
I think I'm allergic to seaweed, Jimmy.

12:16.277 --> 12:17.696
Sculptures can't talk.

12:17.779 --> 12:19.280
Well, I'm gonna head back to my restaurant

12:19.364 --> 12:21.741
and get ready for Ocean Fest,
'cause mine didn't catch on fire

12:21.825 --> 12:23.284
like an idiot.
Bye-zoom!

12:23.368 --> 12:26.329
Oh, go French-kiss a jellyfish, Jimmy!

12:26.413 --> 12:27.831
<i>LOUISE:</i>
<i>Hello...</i>

12:27.914 --> 12:29.290
"Kyle."

12:29.374 --> 12:31.376
We're just following up
on a phone call you received

12:31.459 --> 12:34.504
this morning about, I believe,
it's called a thermocouple.

12:34.587 --> 12:36.006
Oh, the, uh, heavy-breathing guy

12:36.089 --> 12:37.674
who sounded scary but also vulnerable?

12:37.757 --> 12:40.051
-Big-time.
-Yeah. I told him we sold the last one.

12:40.135 --> 12:42.387
Totally.
We just need to know who you sold it to.

12:42.470 --> 12:44.681
Oh. I don't think
I'm supposed to tell you that.

12:44.764 --> 12:46.683
Dang. We can't break this guy.
Should we just go?

12:46.766 --> 12:48.893
We're not leaving
until we get that name from you.

12:48.977 --> 12:51.980
Wouldn't want your nice kitchen
supply store to get messed up.

12:52.063 --> 12:54.899
-What?
-Oh. Look at this
beautiful display of whisks.

12:54.983 --> 12:56.901
-Yeah. That was me.
-They go from small to large.

12:56.985 --> 12:59.404
Thank you. You don't know
how hard I had to fight for that.

12:59.487 --> 13:01.781
Well, what if this little one goes here?

13:01.865 --> 13:03.616
-(Kyle gasping)
-And this one goes here.

13:03.700 --> 13:06.077
And this one just gets
mushed in with this one?!

13:06.161 --> 13:07.245
Okay, okay, I'll tell you.

13:07.328 --> 13:08.788
Just stop messing with my whisks.

13:08.872 --> 13:10.040
I don't know her name.

13:10.123 --> 13:11.833
I just know she's opening
a new shrimp restaurant.

13:11.916 --> 13:13.168
It's called A Shrimp-le Plan.

13:13.251 --> 13:14.753
-I love her.
-You did good, Kyle.

13:14.836 --> 13:16.171
Now go tend to your whisks.

13:16.254 --> 13:18.381
We got to go see a shrimp about a lady.

13:18.465 --> 13:19.883
TEDDY:
Here it is.

13:19.966 --> 13:21.634
I got the grill.
And maybe a hernia.

13:21.718 --> 13:23.178
But I'm fighting through it.

13:23.261 --> 13:26.097
Thanks, Teddy. I guess
I need to put it on top of my grill

13:26.181 --> 13:28.183
-so I can use the vent, right?
-That works.

13:28.266 --> 13:30.101
-Just seems rude.
-What?

13:30.185 --> 13:31.936
I don't know, it's like having an affair

13:32.020 --> 13:34.564
with another woman on top of my wife.

13:34.647 --> 13:36.107
I <i>am </i>a pretty sound sleeper.

13:36.191 --> 13:37.942
Okay. Uh, grill?

13:38.026 --> 13:39.903
I'm-I'm really sorry
for what we're about to do.

13:39.986 --> 13:42.155
Here's the thing.
We're gonna put this...

13:42.238 --> 13:44.449
other grill on top of you to cook.

13:44.532 --> 13:46.868
It might feel weird,
but it's not long-term.

13:46.951 --> 13:48.870
But... but you can't get hot right now.

13:48.953 --> 13:51.206
(crying): You're...
you're gonna get better soon, though.

13:51.289 --> 13:53.375
I know it.
Just shut your eyes.

13:53.458 --> 13:54.834
Teddy, let's just do it!

13:54.918 --> 13:56.711
I'm crying over here.

13:56.795 --> 13:59.339
-LOUISE: Ugh! Nobody's here.
-TINA: What should we do?

13:59.422 --> 14:01.716
Forget about the plan?
Come back when she opens this place?

14:01.800 --> 14:03.551
-Eat a bunch of shrimp?
-You're allergic.

14:03.635 --> 14:04.928
You don't know me!

14:05.011 --> 14:08.056
Dang it!
Who locks all their doors when they leave?

14:08.139 --> 14:09.724
Oh, my God.
I see it.

14:09.808 --> 14:11.601
It's right there.
It's sitting on the counter.

14:11.685 --> 14:14.104
Damn, look at the thermocouple
on that thing.

14:14.187 --> 14:16.231
-Huh.
-Why'd you just say "huh" like that?

14:16.314 --> 14:18.233
I mean, they won't
need it until they open.

14:18.316 --> 14:19.901
Would it really make a difference

14:19.984 --> 14:21.986
if we borrowed it until Dad got a new one?

14:22.070 --> 14:23.988
You mean, like, steal it?

14:24.072 --> 14:26.825
<i>-Borrow, </i>Tina.
-How? The door is locked.

14:26.908 --> 14:29.494
-Well, windows get broken.
-N-No, they don't.

14:29.577 --> 14:31.204
They do.
They get broken all the time.

14:31.287 --> 14:34.082
I don't know, rocks,
croquet balls, drunk birds.

14:34.165 --> 14:35.959
-Nope.
-Gene, help me find a rock.

14:36.042 --> 14:38.044
-Gene, don't help her.
-Darn it.

14:38.128 --> 14:39.546
-I only found a brick.
-Perfect.

14:39.629 --> 14:41.548
Don't give it to her.
Take the brick and run!

14:41.631 --> 14:42.632
I can't run with a brick.

14:42.716 --> 14:44.259
I can barely run without a brick.

14:44.342 --> 14:46.428
Louise, if we break the window
and take the thermocouple,

14:46.511 --> 14:48.263
doesn't that make us <i>actually </i>horrible?

14:48.346 --> 14:49.723
Maybe that's just what we are.

14:49.806 --> 14:51.891
We set our restaurant on fire
this morning.

14:51.975 --> 14:54.102
We're horrible.
We're bad eggs.

14:54.185 --> 14:56.855
But if we take that thing,
at least it'll help Mom and Dad.

14:56.938 --> 14:58.064
Uh...

14:58.148 --> 14:59.858
-Wait, let me write a note.
-A note?

14:59.941 --> 15:01.526
Yes. An apology note.
Something like,

15:01.609 --> 15:03.361
"We're really sorry we broke your window,

15:03.445 --> 15:04.738
love, Tina, Gene and Louise"?

15:04.821 --> 15:06.406
No! No names.

15:06.489 --> 15:08.074
Maybe just, "Here's a free brick"?

15:08.158 --> 15:09.284
Oh, God, whatever.

15:09.367 --> 15:10.702
Here, give me that.

15:10.785 --> 15:11.953
All right, we're doing this.

15:12.037 --> 15:13.496
-Oh, God, we're doing this.
-Yes!

15:13.580 --> 15:14.873
Aah!

15:14.956 --> 15:17.667
Bubba Gump, give us strength!

15:20.128 --> 15:21.713
Aah!

15:21.796 --> 15:23.840
Okay, just do it!
You're stressing me out!

15:23.923 --> 15:26.217
Hang on.
I'm getting warmed up.

15:26.301 --> 15:28.636
Aah!

15:28.720 --> 15:31.639
Damn it!
I just don't think I can do it.

15:31.723 --> 15:33.058
Gene, you try.

15:35.143 --> 15:36.853
I can't do it.

15:36.936 --> 15:37.937
-Tina?
-Fine.

15:38.021 --> 15:39.272
Wait, no, I'm not doing it.

15:39.356 --> 15:40.940
Hi.

15:41.024 --> 15:42.692
Welcome to Bob's Burgers.
Ignore the smell.

15:42.776 --> 15:44.527
We had a fire.
That's not the food.

15:44.611 --> 15:46.738
-Are you guys open?
-Are we... open?

15:46.821 --> 15:48.990
Uh, that is a good question.
Hold on.

15:49.074 --> 15:51.076
Bob, how we doing back there?

15:51.159 --> 15:52.327
BOB:
Why isn't it turning on?

15:52.410 --> 15:53.953
Why is this grill also not working?

15:54.037 --> 15:55.372
Why-why is this happening?

15:55.455 --> 15:57.499
Why did everything
turn out the way it did?

15:57.582 --> 15:59.918
-Hey, you sound like me every morning.
-(groans softly)

16:00.001 --> 16:01.336
Uh-oh.
The propane tank is pretty light.

16:01.419 --> 16:02.837
They might have forgotten to fill it.

16:02.921 --> 16:04.464
-Oh, my God.
-LINDA: Bob?

16:04.547 --> 16:06.591
Uh, ask them if they
like their burger cooked.

16:06.675 --> 16:08.885
LINDA:
Excuse me, do you like your bur...

16:08.968 --> 16:10.845
-(door bells jingle)
-Oh, you're leaving. Have a nice day.

16:10.929 --> 16:13.056
I could go back to the place
and get a new tank.

16:13.139 --> 16:15.308
No. You won't get back
till after the lunch rush.

16:15.392 --> 16:17.268
Gah!
I wish I was made of propane.

16:17.352 --> 16:19.979
I would get inside that tank
for you so fast.

16:20.063 --> 16:21.940
Hi, parents.

16:22.023 --> 16:23.191
-Hi, kids.
-Wait, wait.

16:23.274 --> 16:25.110
Why are you still
holding all of the flyers?

16:25.193 --> 16:27.779
-Y-You didn't pass them out?
-What the heck have you kids been doing?

16:27.862 --> 16:29.280
-Should we just tell them?
-(sighs)

16:29.364 --> 16:30.490
We didn't pass out flyers

16:30.573 --> 16:31.825
'cause we've been trying to track down

16:31.908 --> 16:33.743
the one thermocouple in this dang town.

16:33.827 --> 16:35.286
And when we finally found it,

16:35.370 --> 16:38.289
the only way to get it was
to break a window and steal it.

16:38.373 --> 16:39.708
What?! No!

16:39.791 --> 16:40.709
Oh, God.

16:40.792 --> 16:41.793
It was Tina's idea.

16:41.876 --> 16:42.794
Wait, what?

16:42.877 --> 16:44.045
But we couldn't do it.

16:44.129 --> 16:46.131
Kids, you can't go around
breaking windows.

16:46.214 --> 16:47.632
Even if it <i>is </i>fun.

16:47.716 --> 16:49.968
Smashing it and running away
and laughing...

16:50.051 --> 16:51.469
-Lin.
-Kids, no!

16:51.553 --> 16:53.972
No window breaking.
No stealing, too.

16:54.055 --> 16:55.306
Even if that's fun.

16:55.390 --> 16:57.392
Grabbing the thing
and running and laughing...

16:57.475 --> 16:58.560
-Lin.
-Sorry.

16:58.643 --> 17:00.020
You were right about us, Dad.

17:00.103 --> 17:01.354
We <i>are </i>horrible.

17:01.438 --> 17:03.940
And we felt horrible
about being so horrible.

17:04.024 --> 17:05.692
And then we almost
did something horrible

17:05.775 --> 17:08.069
because we felt horrible
about being horrible.

17:08.153 --> 17:09.237
W-W-Wait, what?

17:09.320 --> 17:10.488
We'll pack our things.

17:10.572 --> 17:12.157
Actually, Mom,
if you could pack our things,

17:12.240 --> 17:14.367
that'd be great.
We're really bad at packing.

17:14.451 --> 17:16.286
This is Bob's Burgers, right?

17:16.369 --> 17:20.123
Uh, yeah. But, uh, we don't have
the burgers part right now.

17:20.206 --> 17:21.750
I was just stopping by because of this.

17:21.833 --> 17:24.586
Our flyer?
Oh, kids, you <i>did </i>hand out one.

17:24.669 --> 17:27.672
Yeah, sorry.
Our grill is, uh, uh, not working.

17:27.756 --> 17:29.424
Both of them.
We have two grills.

17:29.507 --> 17:30.925
It's-it's complicated.

17:31.009 --> 17:32.510
Actually, that's kind of why I came by.

17:32.594 --> 17:34.512
-I read about it on the flyer.
-My note!

17:34.596 --> 17:36.014
It must have fallen out of my pocket.

17:36.097 --> 17:37.349
I'm Pam.
From A Shrimp-le Plan.

17:37.432 --> 17:38.433
Pam Shrimple.

17:38.516 --> 17:39.976
Oh, God, are you here to arrest us?

17:40.060 --> 17:42.645
No. I came because I thought
the note was really sweet.

17:42.729 --> 17:44.147
I mean, it's a little weird,
writing an apology

17:44.230 --> 17:45.148
for something you didn't do.

17:45.231 --> 17:46.733
But I'm also glad you didn't.

17:46.816 --> 17:47.942
'Cause I like my window.

17:48.026 --> 17:49.194
"Dear Shrimp Lady,

17:49.277 --> 17:50.945
"We're sorry we broke your window.

17:51.029 --> 17:53.114
"Our dad needs your thermocouple.

17:53.198 --> 17:55.700
"We set our restaurant on fire
and ruined his grill.

17:55.784 --> 17:57.911
"He's a great dad and a great cook.

17:57.994 --> 17:59.662
"Sometimes he smells weird.

17:59.746 --> 18:01.331
-"But we're used to it.
-Mm.

18:01.414 --> 18:04.167
"We promise we'll be back
in a few days with the thermocouple

18:04.250 --> 18:05.835
"and money to pay for a new window.

18:05.919 --> 18:07.170
"Good luck with the shrimps.

18:07.253 --> 18:08.922
We're sorry."
Long note.

18:09.005 --> 18:09.923
Yeah, it came up.

18:10.006 --> 18:11.007
You've got some good kids here.

18:11.091 --> 18:12.092
I wanted you to know that.

18:12.175 --> 18:14.260
And I wanted to bring you this.

18:14.344 --> 18:15.261
The thermocouple.

18:15.345 --> 18:16.262
We don't open for a month.

18:16.346 --> 18:17.597
It's all yours.
Go nuts.

18:17.681 --> 18:19.724
Wow. That is really nice.
Thank you.

18:19.808 --> 18:21.643
Wait, I think Teddy left.
I-I got to call him.

18:21.726 --> 18:22.936
TEDDY:
Nope. I'm still here.

18:23.019 --> 18:24.854
I was using your employee bathroom.

18:24.938 --> 18:26.856
Quick question,
do you have an employee plunger?

18:26.940 --> 18:27.857
Oh. Hello, ma'am.

18:27.941 --> 18:29.442
Teddy, we got a thermocouple.

18:29.526 --> 18:31.027
-W-We need you to install it.
-Great.

18:31.111 --> 18:32.612
You want a burger?
On the house.

18:32.696 --> 18:34.030
All right!
Let's do that, too.

18:34.114 --> 18:35.657
Oh. No.
I was talking to her.

18:35.740 --> 18:37.283
-Oh.
-Uh, you can have one.

18:37.367 --> 18:39.536
-Yay!
-Sit anywhere you want.
-Thanks.

18:39.619 --> 18:41.079
Oh, great.
You're here.

18:41.162 --> 18:42.288
No, not to inspect.

18:42.372 --> 18:44.207
-Hugo has something to say.
-Eh.

18:44.290 --> 18:45.625
All right, fine, I'll start.

18:45.709 --> 18:47.210
We heard about the fire, didn't we?

18:47.293 --> 18:48.962
-Eh. Yep.
-And I was going back over

18:49.045 --> 18:50.296
what was happening yesterday,

18:50.380 --> 18:51.840
-and I remem...
-(sighing loudly)

18:51.923 --> 18:54.509
I remembered that Hugo
pulled out all your greasy rags.

18:54.592 --> 18:56.136
-Didn't you, Hugo?
-(mumbles)

18:56.219 --> 18:58.471
And as you might know,
when grease-soaked rags are exposed

18:58.555 --> 19:01.224
to open air,
they can sometimes spontaneously what?

19:01.307 --> 19:03.643
-Rarely.
-They spontaneously combust.

19:03.727 --> 19:04.644
So, yeah,

19:04.728 --> 19:06.563
I, um, started your fire.

19:06.646 --> 19:07.814
(mumbles):
I'm sorry.

19:07.897 --> 19:09.232
Hugo, louder.

19:09.315 --> 19:10.233
The last part.

19:10.316 --> 19:11.359
(quietly):
I'm... sorry.

19:11.443 --> 19:12.360
Hugo.

19:12.444 --> 19:13.945
I'm sorry!
There, I said it!

19:28.668 --> 19:30.503
-I mean, the stuff we did didn't help.
-Tina, shush.

19:41.056 --> 19:43.808
Mom, unpack our things.
We're staying.

19:43.892 --> 19:45.060
Yeah, that makes sense.

19:45.143 --> 19:46.811
I thought I picked up
the rags you threw at me,

19:46.895 --> 19:48.646
but I guess I didn't find them all.

19:48.730 --> 19:52.108
Hopefully you've learned your
lesson about greasy rag storage.

19:52.192 --> 19:53.860
No, you don't get to say that.

19:53.943 --> 19:55.278
We're leaving.
Can't hear you!

19:55.362 --> 19:57.364
Sorry about the fire.
Hugo will probably offer

19:57.447 --> 19:59.199
to help you cover
your insurance deductible.

19:59.282 --> 20:00.658
Ron!
(mumbles)

20:00.742 --> 20:01.743
Oh, we got customers.

20:01.826 --> 20:02.744
How we doing, Teddy?

20:02.827 --> 20:03.745
TEDDY:
Almost done!

20:03.828 --> 20:05.497
Hi. Here you go.
Thanks. Here you go.

20:05.580 --> 20:07.082
-Hey, kids.
-Yeah?

20:07.165 --> 20:09.334
You know I don't actually
think you're horrible, right?

20:09.417 --> 20:13.171
It's just something I said
'cause sometimes... you...

20:13.254 --> 20:14.172
-are.
-Bob.

20:14.255 --> 20:15.340
At restaurant stuff.

20:15.423 --> 20:17.008
But then look at what you did.

20:17.092 --> 20:18.551
You-you cared about this place so much,

20:18.635 --> 20:20.053
you were gonna break a window for it.

20:20.136 --> 20:22.055
I'd do more than that.
I'd kill a guy.

20:22.138 --> 20:23.306
Uh, okay, don't do that.

20:23.390 --> 20:25.308
But I just want to say,
you kids are great.

20:25.392 --> 20:27.143
Maybe the best ever.

20:27.227 --> 20:29.145
Including that kid from <i>Jerry Maguire?</i>

20:31.815 --> 20:33.233
-I do.
-Nerd!

20:33.316 --> 20:35.068
Wow.
Oh, my God.

20:35.151 --> 20:36.403
Best sculpture.

20:36.486 --> 20:38.238
I mean, like, what even is this?

20:38.321 --> 20:39.572
Let's take a picture with it.

20:39.656 --> 20:41.408
Did you hear that?!
Best sculpture!

20:41.491 --> 20:42.659
Those were probably the judges!

20:42.742 --> 20:43.868
Lin, I don't think those were the...

20:43.952 --> 20:45.537
The pictures are probably for the paper.

20:45.620 --> 20:48.123
-I won! I won!
-Nice work, Mama.

20:48.206 --> 20:50.709
Aw. After Ocean Fest,
we should bring her inside.

20:50.792 --> 20:53.461
-She's looking cold.
We'll take her upstairs.
-(others protesting)

20:53.545 --> 20:55.672
-LOUISE: That's an out...
that's an outdoor sculpture.
-No, we just take it.

20:55.755 --> 20:57.841
-Just for one night...
-BOB: No.

21:16.818 --> 21:19.404
<i>RON: Hugo, louder.</i>
<i>The last part.</i>

21:19.487 --> 21:21.156
<i>HUGO:</i>
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

21:24.534 --> 21:26.077
<i>HUGO:</i>
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

21:26.161 --> 21:27.871
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

21:27.954 --> 21:30.874
<i>-RON: Hugo.</i>
<i>-HUGO: I'm sorry. There, I said it!</i>
