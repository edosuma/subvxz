07:06.159 --> 07:07.827
I DON'T CARE, BECAUSE BIG WAS

07:07.894 --> 07:08.661
POMPOUS, GOOD FOR NOTHING, AND

07:08.728 --> 07:09.295
-- LET'S BE HONEST -- VOTED FOR

07:09.362 --> 07:10.096
TRUMP.

07:10.163 --> 07:13.866
BUT I DO CARE A LITTLE BECAUSE I

07:13.933 --> 07:15.101
THAT KNOW CARRIE CARES.

07:15.168 --> 07:15.701
LOOK AT HER THERE IN HIS LAST

07:15.768 --> 07:16.702
MOMENTS, DEVASTATED, DOING

07:16.769 --> 07:19.605
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

07:19.672 --> 07:21.641
BUT THEIR AMBIVALENCE SPEAKS TO

07:21.707 --> 07:22.208
THE FACT THAT -- TO A DEGREE

07:22.275 --> 07:23.142
AMERICANS MAY NOT REALIZE -- THE

07:23.209 --> 07:25.211
MONARCHY ISN'T A UNIVERSALLY

07:25.278 --> 07:26.479
BELOVED INSTITUTION.

07:26.546 --> 07:27.580
AND THEY WERE BEING VERY NICE

07:27.647 --> 07:29.015
ABOUT IT.

07:29.081 --> 07:30.483
OTHERS HAVE BEEN LESS KIND.

07:30.550 --> 07:32.018
IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE QUEEN'S

07:32.084 --> 07:33.953
DEATH, MANY SPORTING EVENTS HELD

07:34.020 --> 07:35.154
A "MINUTE OF SILENCE."

07:35.221 --> 07:36.389
BUT SOME CROWDS -- PARTICULARLY

07:36.455 --> 07:38.224
IN SCOTLAND AND IRELAND -- WENT

07:38.291 --> 07:39.826
A DIFFERENT WAY, WITH THIS SONG

07:39.892 --> 07:42.061
PROVING PARTICULARLY POPULAR.

07:42.128 --> 07:42.962
>> [CROWD SINGING "LIZZIE'S IN A

07:43.029 --> 07:54.240
BOX"]

07:54.307 --> 07:55.541
>> John: YEAH, "LIZZIE'S IN A

07:55.608 --> 07:56.442
BOX."

07:56.509 --> 07:58.077
WHICH I KNOW SOUNDS INSENSITIVE,

07:58.144 --> 07:59.779
BUT I'D ARGUE OF ALL THE PLACES

07:59.846 --> 08:01.581
THEY COULD HAVE CHANTED SHE WAS

08:01.647 --> 08:02.448
IN, "BOX" IS ACTUALLY PRETTY

08:02.515 --> 08:04.450
GENEROUS.

08:04.517 --> 08:06.152
AND LOOK, YOU CAN MAKE THE CASE

08:06.219 --> 08:07.086
THAT'S IN BAD TASTE.

08:07.153 --> 08:07.854
YOU CAN ALSO MAKE THE CASE IT'S

08:07.920 --> 08:08.588
VERY FUNNY.

08:08.654 --> 08:10.122
TWO THINGS CAN BE TRUE.

08:10.189 --> 08:12.358
EVEN WE GOT IN TROUBLE WHEN

08:12.425 --> 08:14.460
SKY TV IN THE UK CUT A COUPLE OF

08:14.527 --> 08:15.695
FAIRLY BENIGN JOKES WE DID THE

08:15.761 --> 08:17.063
WEEK SHE DIED.

08:17.129 --> 08:19.131
WHO KNOWS IF THIS SEGMENT WILL

08:19.198 --> 08:21.634
EVEN AIR ON TV OVER THERE?

08:21.701 --> 08:22.301
JUST IN CASE THEY REFUSE, WE'VE

08:22.368 --> 08:23.903
ACTUALLY PREPARED AN ALTERNATE

08:23.970 --> 08:25.104
SHOW FOR THEM, WHERE THIS STORY

08:25.171 --> 08:26.472
IS REPLACED WITH A 25-MINUTE

08:26.539 --> 08:29.008
LOOP OF THIS VIDEO OF WINSTON

08:29.075 --> 08:31.477
CHURCHILL GOING BACKWARDS DOWN A

08:31.544 --> 08:32.044
WATERSLIDE, SET TO THE BENNY

08:32.111 --> 08:32.345
HILL THEME.

08:32.411 --> 08:35.414
SO THEY WON'T HAVE NOTHING.

08:35.481 --> 08:37.383
BUT IN THE UK, THE ARGUMENT WAS

08:37.450 --> 08:38.251
THAT, IN THE WAKE OF THE QUEEN'S

08:38.317 --> 08:39.952
DEATH, IT JUST WASN'T THE TIME

08:40.019 --> 08:41.921
FOR CRITICISM OF HER OR THE

08:41.988 --> 08:45.892
MONARCHY IN GENERAL.

08:45.958 --> 08:46.726
IT WOULD BE IMPOLITE.

08:46.792 --> 08:47.693
BUT IT'S BEEN TWO MONTHS SINCE

08:47.760 --> 08:48.794
THEN, AND CHARLES IS KING NOW.

08:48.861 --> 08:49.729
AND WHILE, FOR MANY, THE CHARM

08:49.795 --> 08:50.563
OF HIS MOTHER WAS IN HER

08:50.630 --> 08:51.163
LONGEVITY.

08:51.230 --> 08:53.332
SHE WAS THE ONLY SOVEREIGN MOST

08:53.399 --> 08:54.734
BRITONS HAD EVER KNOWN, AND HER

08:54.800 --> 08:56.369
TENDENCY TOWARD SILENCE, YOU

08:56.435 --> 08:57.703
NEVER KNEW WHAT SHE THOUGHT

08:57.770 --> 08:59.138
ABOUT ANYTHING.

08:59.205 --> 09:00.907
NEITHER OF THOSE THINGS ARE TRUE

09:00.973 --> 09:01.908
OF HER SON.

09:01.974 --> 09:03.609
BECAUSE CHARLES -- A MAN WHOSE

09:03.676 --> 09:04.443
FACE ANSWERS THE QUESTION "WHAT

09:04.510 --> 09:05.878
IF TWO COUSINS HAD A KID" -- IS

09:05.945 --> 09:11.851
TAKING THE THRONE AT THE RIPE

09:11.918 --> 09:12.385
AGE OF 73, HE HAD TO PUT IT

09:12.451 --> 09:13.052
MILDLY, AN INCREDIBLY MESSY

09:13.119 --> 09:13.986
DIVORCE, AND HAS BEEN OUTSPOKEN

09:14.053 --> 09:14.820
ON A RANGE OF TOPICS, FROM

09:14.887 --> 09:15.454
ARCHITECTURE, TO THE

09:15.521 --> 09:19.425
ENVIRONMENT, TO HIS BELIEF IN

09:19.492 --> 09:20.459
HOMEOPATHIC MEDICINE, INCLUDING

09:20.526 --> 09:20.993
SUPPORTING A CONTROVERSIAL

09:21.060 --> 09:21.861
CANCER TREATMENT WHICH INVOLVES

09:21.928 --> 09:23.195
13 FRUIT JUICES A DAY, COFFEE

09:23.262 --> 09:24.463
ENEMAS, AND WEEKLY INJECTIONS OF

09:24.530 --> 09:25.631
VITAMINS.

09:25.698 --> 09:27.033
THE POINT IS, HE DOESN'T HAVE

09:27.099 --> 09:29.135
THE INSCRUTABILITY OF HIS

09:29.201 --> 09:30.469
MOTHER, OR ENJOY HER LEVEL OF

09:30.536 --> 09:31.404
PUBLIC AFFECTION.

09:31.470 --> 09:33.673
AND HIS ASCENT TO THE THRONE

09:33.739 --> 09:34.206
COMES AS THE UK'S FACING A

09:34.273 --> 09:36.208
COST-OF-LIVING CRISIS.

09:36.275 --> 09:38.244
ONE MAN EVEN CONFRONTED CHARLES

09:38.311 --> 09:39.378
DIRECTLY ABOUT THIS.

09:39.445 --> 09:40.880
>> CHARLES!

09:40.947 --> 09:42.214
WHILE WE STRUGGLE TO HEAT OUR

09:42.281 --> 09:43.015
HOMES, WE HAVE TO PAY FOR YOUR

09:43.082 --> 09:44.116
PARADE.

09:44.183 --> 09:45.217
>> OH...

09:45.284 --> 09:46.752
>> THE TAXPAYER PAYS

09:46.819 --> 09:49.121
$100 MILLION FOR YOU, WHAT FOR?

09:49.188 --> 09:50.222
>> John: WOW.

09:50.289 --> 09:52.124
THAT BEFUDDLED "OH" FROM HIM

09:52.191 --> 09:55.628
PRETTY MUCH SAYS IT ALL THERE.

09:55.695 --> 09:56.629
BUT THAT WASN'T THE ONLY RECENT

09:56.696 --> 09:56.862
PROTEST.

09:56.929 --> 09:57.463
JUST THIS WEEK, A MAN THREW

09:57.530 --> 09:58.130
MULTIPLE EGGS AT CHARLES ON THE

09:58.197 --> 09:59.198
STREET.

09:59.265 --> 10:00.800
AND WHEN THEY CAUGHT HIM, HE

10:00.866 --> 10:01.834
DIDN'T SEEM THAT SORRY, GIVEN

10:01.901 --> 10:03.202
THIS WAS THE PHOTO FROM HIS

10:03.269 --> 10:05.037
ARREST.

10:05.104 --> 10:06.372
HE WAS RELEASED ON BAIL, WITH

10:06.439 --> 10:07.840
CONDITIONS INCLUDING -- AND THIS

10:07.907 --> 10:09.275
IS TRUE -- NOT BEING ALLOWED TO

10:09.342 --> 10:11.177
BE WITHIN 500 METERS OF THE

10:11.243 --> 10:13.179
KING, AND NOT BEING ALLOWED TO

10:13.245 --> 10:14.013
POSSESS ANY EGGS IN A PUBLIC

10:14.080 --> 10:15.448
PLACE.

10:15.514 --> 10:17.416
WHICH REALLY SHOWS JUST HOW FAR

10:17.483 --> 10:18.017
THE POWER OF THE MONARCHY HAS

10:18.084 --> 10:18.651
FALLEN.

10:18.718 --> 10:20.286
A FEW HUNDRED YEARS AGO, IT

10:20.353 --> 10:20.886
WOULD HAVE BEEN INSTANT

10:20.953 --> 10:21.921
BEHEADING.

10:21.988 --> 10:23.055
NOW THE PUNISHMENT IS "BE

10:23.122 --> 10:23.622
CAREFUL IN THE REFRIGERATED

10:23.689 --> 10:25.458
AISLE."

10:25.524 --> 10:26.892
SO GIVEN THAT CHARLES IS NOW

10:26.959 --> 10:28.260
KING, AND WILL ACTUALLY HAVE A

10:28.327 --> 10:30.363
FORMAL CORONATION NEXT MAY, TO

10:30.429 --> 10:32.665
BE BEAMED BY CAMERAS ALL AROUND

10:32.732 --> 10:34.467
THE WORLD, BEFORE THAT HAPPENS,

10:34.533 --> 10:36.535
WE THOUGHT TONIGHT, IT'D BE

10:36.602 --> 10:42.108
WORTH LOOKING AT THE BRITISH

10:42.174 --> 10:42.708
MONARCHY SPECIFICALLY, TO ASK

10:42.775 --> 10:43.309
WHAT THE POINT OF IT IS, FIRST

10:43.376 --> 10:43.843
IN THE UK, AND THEN IN THE

10:43.909 --> 10:44.477
COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD WHERE

10:44.543 --> 10:45.077
THE MONARCH STILL SERVES AS A

10:45.144 --> 10:45.378
FIGUREHEAD.

10:45.444 --> 10:47.113
AND LET'S START WITH THE BASIC

10:47.179 --> 10:48.547
QUESTION OF, "WHAT DOES THE

10:48.614 --> 10:50.316
ROYAL FAMILY DO?"

10:50.383 --> 10:51.751
IT'S SOMETHING THAT EVEN THEY'VE

10:51.817 --> 10:52.685
HAD TROUBLE DEFINING IN THE

10:52.752 --> 10:53.986
PAST, AS THIS CLIP OF

10:54.053 --> 10:54.954
PRINCE PHILIP FROM 1968

10:55.021 --> 10:56.489
DEMONSTRATES.

10:56.555 --> 10:58.958
>> COULD YOU TELL ME WHAT IS

10:59.025 --> 11:02.595
YOUR JOB IN YOUR OWN MIND?

11:02.661 --> 11:03.429
>> WELL, I HAVEN'T GOT ONE.

11:03.496 --> 11:05.564
I'M SELF-EMPLOYED.

11:05.631 --> 11:06.599
>> BUT SURELY, YOU MUST HAVE

11:06.665 --> 11:10.102
SOME CLEAR IDEA OF WHAT ROLE YOU

11:10.169 --> 11:14.907
FULFILL IN MODERN SOCIETY.

11:14.974 --> 11:16.275
>> REALLY DIFFICULT TO ANSWER.

11:16.342 --> 11:17.943
>> John: WOW.

11:18.010 --> 11:20.146
IT'S AMAZING TO WATCH HIM

11:20.212 --> 11:21.180
INITIALLY LAUGH THAT OFF BEFORE

11:21.247 --> 11:22.114
CONSIDERING THE QUESTION AND

11:22.181 --> 11:22.948
FACING SOMETHING OF AN

11:23.015 --> 11:25.751
EXISTENTIAL CRISIS.

11:25.818 --> 11:26.719
BUT SINCE THAT QUESTION SEEMED

11:26.786 --> 11:27.520
TO STUMP HIM, PERHAPS WE CAN

11:27.586 --> 11:28.220
HELP.

11:28.287 --> 11:29.789
UNLIKE IN THE U.S., WHERE THE

11:29.855 --> 11:30.489
HEAD OF GOVERNMENT AND THE HEAD

11:30.556 --> 11:33.092
OF STATE ARE THE SAME PERSON, IN

11:33.159 --> 11:33.659
THE UK, THOSE ARE TWO VERY

11:33.726 --> 11:35.394
DIFFERENT ROLES.

11:35.461 --> 11:36.462
BECAUSE WHILE, FOR CENTURIES,

11:36.529 --> 11:37.863
THE BRITISH MONARCH HAD HUGE

11:37.930 --> 11:39.698
POLITICAL POWER, IT WAS

11:39.765 --> 11:41.434
GRADUALLY STRIPPED AWAY, TO THE

11:41.500 --> 11:42.668
POINT THAT THE POSITION'S NOW

11:42.735 --> 11:44.603
LARGELY SYMBOLIC.

11:44.670 --> 11:45.704
THE MONARCH'S MAIN ROLE, AS HEAD

11:45.771 --> 11:47.006
OF STATE, IS TO RECEIVE INCOMING

11:47.073 --> 11:48.074
AND OUTGOING AMBASSADORS AND

11:48.140 --> 11:49.341
VISITING HEADS OF STATE, AND TO

11:49.408 --> 11:50.910
MAKE VISITS ABROAD.

11:50.976 --> 11:52.812
HERE'S THE QUEEN MEETING

11:52.878 --> 11:53.546
NARENDRA MODI, HERE SHE IS

11:53.612 --> 11:54.613
TAKING A CARRIAGE RIDE WITH

11:54.680 --> 11:56.549
VLADIMIR PUTIN, AND HERE SHE IS

11:56.615 --> 11:57.650
WITH FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP.

11:57.716 --> 11:58.984
JUST TWO PEOPLE DELIGHTED TO BE

11:59.051 --> 12:01.821
THERE.

12:01.887 --> 12:02.788
YOU DON'T USUALLY SEE A PAIR SO

12:02.855 --> 12:04.090
UNHAPPY WHILE WEARING FANCY

12:04.156 --> 12:05.224
COSTUMES OUTSIDE OF CATS ON

12:05.291 --> 12:07.226
HALLOWEEN.

12:07.293 --> 12:08.294
THERE ARE ALSO SMALLER

12:08.360 --> 12:10.496
RESPONSIBILITIES, LIKE VISITING

12:10.563 --> 12:12.531
FACTORIES AND OPENING THINGS,

12:12.598 --> 12:13.165
AND ALSO -- AND THIS IS TRUE --

12:13.232 --> 12:14.300
SENDING PEOPLE BIRTHDAY CARDS

12:14.366 --> 12:15.067
WHEN THEY TURN 100.

12:15.134 --> 12:17.103
BASICALLY, THINK OF THE ROYALS

12:17.169 --> 12:17.870
AS MICKEY AND MINNIE AT

12:17.937 --> 12:18.771
DISNEYLAND.

12:18.838 --> 12:20.139
THEY'RE NOT RUNNING THE RIDES,

12:20.206 --> 12:21.707
BUT THEY'RE A MASCOT FOR THE

12:21.774 --> 12:23.843
WHOLE OPERATION, AND PEOPLE LIKE

12:23.909 --> 12:25.878
HAVING PICTURES TAKEN WITH THEM.

12:25.945 --> 12:27.546
AND THE FAMILY'S DEFENDERS WILL

12:27.613 --> 12:28.280
SAY THAT THE CEREMONIAL ASPECT

12:28.347 --> 12:30.182
OF THE MONARCHY IS THE WHOLE

12:30.249 --> 12:30.950
POINT.

12:31.016 --> 12:31.817
IN FACT, THE ROYAL FAMILY'S

12:31.884 --> 12:33.452
OFFICIAL WEBSITE DESCRIBES THE

12:33.519 --> 12:36.655
ROLE OF SOVEREIGN AS A FOCUS FOR

12:36.722 --> 12:37.256
NATIONAL IDENTITY, UNITY, AND

12:37.323 --> 12:38.390
PRIDE, AND THAT IT GIVES A SENSE

12:38.457 --> 12:40.292
OF STABILITY AND CONTINUITY.

12:40.359 --> 12:42.027
BUT THAT COMES AT A PRICE.

12:42.094 --> 12:44.630
AS YOU HEARD THAT MAN YELL

12:44.697 --> 12:45.965
EARLIER, BRITONS PAY MILLIONS OF

12:46.031 --> 12:47.600
POUNDS, EVERY YEAR, TO SUPPORT

12:47.666 --> 12:48.234
THE ROYALS.

12:48.300 --> 12:50.102
ALTHOUGH SOME ARGUE, IT'S MONEY

12:50.169 --> 12:51.137
WELL SPENT.

12:51.203 --> 12:52.938
>> INTERESTINGLY, THE BRITISH

12:53.005 --> 12:55.508
STATE GIVES, OR THE GOVERNMENT

12:55.574 --> 12:56.675
GIVES THE ROYAL FAMILY

12:56.742 --> 12:57.376
£100 MILLION PER YEAR, ROUGHLY.

12:57.443 --> 12:58.777
IT'S CALLED THE SOVEREIGN GRANT

12:58.844 --> 13:01.647
TO PAY FOR UPKEEP.

13:01.714 --> 13:03.215
BUT TOURISM GENERATED BY THE

13:03.282 --> 13:04.517
ROYAL FAMILY GENERATES ABOUT 500

13:04.583 --> 13:10.489
MILLION A YEAR.

13:10.556 --> 13:10.856
SO, THAT'S 5-1.

13:10.923 --> 13:11.423
I WOULD TAKE -- I WOULD TAKE

13:11.490 --> 13:12.024
THAT INVESTMENT RETURN.

13:12.091 --> 13:12.625
>> John: YES, DEFENDERS ARGUE

13:12.691 --> 13:13.259
WHATEVER MONEY THE ROYAL FAMILY

13:13.325 --> 13:13.993
COSTS IS VASTLY OUTWEIGHED BY

13:14.059 --> 13:15.027
WHAT THEY BRING IN.

13:15.094 --> 13:16.061
IT'S THE SAME ARGUMENT THOUSANDS

13:16.128 --> 13:17.463
OF MEN HAVE MADE TO THEIR WIVES

13:17.530 --> 13:18.864
ABOUT INVESTING IN CRYPTO.

13:18.931 --> 13:20.366
AND IT'S GOING REALLY WELL FOR

13:20.432 --> 13:21.767
THEM RIGHT NOW!

13:21.834 --> 13:22.902
BUT A FEW THINGS.

13:22.968 --> 13:25.104
FIRST, THE CLAIM THEY BRING IN

13:25.171 --> 13:27.473
$500 MILLION A YEAR IN TOURISM

13:27.540 --> 13:28.040
IS HEAVILY DISPUTED.

13:28.107 --> 13:29.975
AND IT'S NOT LIKE THAT GOES AWAY

13:30.042 --> 13:30.743
IF THE ROYAL FAMILY DOES.

13:30.809 --> 13:32.578
YOU CAN STILL VISIT A PALACE IF

13:32.645 --> 13:34.146
NOBODY LIVES INSIDE IT.

13:34.213 --> 13:36.015
NOBODY SHOWS UP TO VERSAILLES

13:36.081 --> 13:37.149
AND SAYS, "WAIT, NO ONE LIVES

13:37.216 --> 13:39.485
HERE?

13:39.552 --> 13:40.786
IT'S A HARD PASS FOR ME."

13:40.853 --> 13:41.587
AND THE NOTION THAT "THE

13:41.654 --> 13:43.222
MONARCHY ONLY COSTS $100 MILLION

13:43.289 --> 13:44.823
POUNDS" ALSO HAS SOME MAJOR

13:44.890 --> 13:45.691
ASTERISKS ON IT.

13:45.758 --> 13:47.226
BECAUSE WHILE IT'S TRUE THAT, AS

13:47.293 --> 13:48.294
IS OFTEN SAID, THE "SOVEREIGN

13:48.360 --> 13:54.400
GRANT" AMOUNTS TO JUST OVER A

13:54.466 --> 13:55.034
POUND A PERSON IN THE UK, IT'S

13:55.100 --> 13:55.601
BY NO MEANS THE ROYALS' ONLY

13:55.668 --> 13:56.035
SOURCE OF INCOME.

13:56.101 --> 13:56.635
>> THE NEW KING NOW HAS THREE

13:56.702 --> 13:58.237
MAIN SOURCES OF WEALTH, THE

13:58.304 --> 13:59.838
SOVEREIGN GRANT, MONEY THE UK

13:59.905 --> 14:00.673
TREASURY GIVES THE CROWN TO

14:00.739 --> 14:02.308
FULFILL ITS ROYAL DUTIES.

14:02.374 --> 14:03.842
THE FAMILY'S PRIVATE WEALTH, THE

14:03.909 --> 14:05.511
FULL EXTENT A CLOSELY GUARDED

14:05.578 --> 14:07.079
SECRET.

14:07.146 --> 14:08.681
THEN THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER, A

14:08.747 --> 14:11.150
PRIVATE ESTATE OF LAND PROPERTY

14:11.217 --> 14:12.585
AND ASSETS, THE MONARCH RECEIVES

14:12.651 --> 14:14.053
ITS ANNUAL PROFITS.

14:14.119 --> 14:15.921
THE QUEEN RECEIVED $27 MILLION

14:15.988 --> 14:17.656
FROM IT LAST YEAR.

14:17.723 --> 14:18.457
>> John: IT'S TRUE.

14:18.524 --> 14:20.659
THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER IS A

14:20.726 --> 14:22.361
MASSIVE PROPERTY PORTFOLIO,

14:22.428 --> 14:22.895
CONTAINING LAND THAT --

14:22.962 --> 14:24.163
INCIDENTALLY -- WAS SEIZED BY

14:24.230 --> 14:25.431
THE MONARCHY BACK IN THE 13TH

14:25.497 --> 14:26.732
CENTURY, AND FROM WHICH THEY

14:26.799 --> 14:27.366
CONTINUE TO DRAW PERSONAL

14:27.433 --> 14:29.702
PROFITS TO THIS DAY.

14:29.768 --> 14:30.803
SO, AS KING, CHARLES GETS MONEY

14:30.869 --> 14:31.604
FROM THE GOVERNMENT, MONEY

14:31.670 --> 14:33.472
PASSED DOWN THROUGH HIS FAMILY

14:33.539 --> 14:34.039
AND MONEY FROM THE DUCHY OF

14:34.106 --> 14:34.640
LANCASTER.

14:34.707 --> 14:36.275
AND NONE OF THAT INCLUDES THE

14:36.342 --> 14:37.243
DUCHY OF CORNWALL, HELD BY

14:37.309 --> 14:39.578
WHOEVER HOLDS THE TITLE OF

14:39.645 --> 14:40.846
PRINCE OF WALES -- NOW PRINCE

14:40.913 --> 14:42.181
WILLIAM.

14:42.248 --> 14:43.882
THAT'S A SEPARATE BILLION-DOLLAR

14:43.949 --> 14:46.418
REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO NEARLY THE

14:46.485 --> 14:47.720
SIZE OF CHICAGO, BY THE WAY,

14:47.786 --> 14:49.388
WHICH INCLUDES SEASIDE VACATION

14:49.455 --> 14:50.589
RENTALS, OFFICE SPACE IN LONDON

14:50.656 --> 14:52.024
AND A SUBURBAN SUPERMARKET

14:52.091 --> 14:53.692
DEPOT.

14:53.759 --> 14:58.897
THAT ALONE BROUGHT IN MORE THAN

14:58.964 --> 14:59.531
$56 MILLION IN ADDITIONAL INCOME

14:59.598 --> 15:00.165
FOR THE FAMILY LAST YEAR SO THE

15:00.232 --> 15:01.233
ROYAL FAMILY'S WEALTH -- UNLIKE

15:01.300 --> 15:02.768
THEIR GENE POOL -- IS MASSIVE.

15:02.835 --> 15:03.869
AND WHILE, IN 1993, IN RESPONSE

15:03.936 --> 15:06.872
TO PUBLIC ANGER OVER THEIR

15:06.939 --> 15:08.040
SPENDING, BOTH THE QUEEN AND

15:08.107 --> 15:10.109
CHARLES AGREED TO PAY

15:10.175 --> 15:11.076
"VOLUNTARY" INCOME TAXES, THAT

15:11.143 --> 15:11.677
ARRANGEMENT ISN'T NECESSARILY

15:11.744 --> 15:13.412
PERMANENT.

15:13.479 --> 15:14.947
MEANWHILE, THE TWO DUCHIES ARE

15:15.014 --> 15:16.982
COMPLETELY EXEMPT FROM

15:17.049 --> 15:18.017
CORPORATION TAXES, AND CHARLES

15:18.083 --> 15:19.585
DOESN'T HAVE TO PAY ANY

15:19.652 --> 15:20.719
INHERITANCE TAX ON WHATEVER THE

15:20.786 --> 15:21.620
QUEEN PASSED ON TO HIM.

15:21.687 --> 15:24.423
AND WHEN YOU FACTOR ALL THAT IN

15:24.490 --> 15:25.057
IT SURE STARTS TO FEEL LIKE

15:25.124 --> 15:26.258
THEY'RE COSTING A HELL OF A LOT

15:26.325 --> 15:27.226
MORE THAN JUST A POUND PER

15:27.293 --> 15:28.260
PERSON.

15:28.327 --> 15:29.662
SO, IS IT WORTH IT?

15:29.728 --> 15:32.831
WELL, I THINK MY POSITION ON THE

15:32.898 --> 15:33.966
ROYAL FAMILY IS PRETTY

15:34.033 --> 15:35.567
WELL-DOCUMENTED.

15:35.634 --> 15:36.168
TO ME, THEY'RE LIKE A HUMAN

15:36.235 --> 15:37.102
APPENDIX.

15:37.169 --> 15:38.604
WE'VE LONG EVOLVED PAST NEEDING

15:38.671 --> 15:39.838
THEM, AND THERE'S A COMPELLING

15:39.905 --> 15:42.675
CASE FOR THEIR SURGICAL REMOVAL.

15:42.741 --> 15:44.977
BUT I ADMIT, I'M IN THE MINORITY

15:45.044 --> 15:47.046
WHEN IT COMES TO BRITISH PEOPLE.

15:47.112 --> 15:47.613
MANY FEEL EXACTLY LIKE THIS

15:47.680 --> 15:49.381
WOMAN DOES.

15:49.448 --> 15:50.649
>> I JUST THINK IT'S NICE THAT

15:50.716 --> 15:51.517
WE HAVE IT, AND IT MAKES US A

15:51.583 --> 15:52.284
BIT UNUSUAL.

15:52.351 --> 15:52.518
UNIQUE.

15:52.584 --> 15:54.453
YEAH.

15:54.520 --> 15:55.554
I MEAN, IT'S NICE THAT WE HAVE

15:55.621 --> 15:56.689
IT.

15:56.755 --> 15:58.691
IT'S A BRITISH THING, ISN'T IT?

15:58.757 --> 16:00.526
AND I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE

16:00.592 --> 16:02.428
WOULD LIKE WHAT WE HAVE.

16:02.494 --> 16:04.029
>> John: OKAY, BUT "IT'S NICE

16:04.096 --> 16:05.564
THAT WE HAVE IT" ISN'T WHAT YOU

16:05.631 --> 16:07.066
SAY ABOUT A FREE-LOADING

16:07.132 --> 16:08.467
MULTIMILLIONAIRE FAMILY EXEMPT

16:08.534 --> 16:09.501
FROM PAYING MOST TAXES, IT'S

16:09.568 --> 16:11.103
WHAT YOU SAY ABOUT A WATER

16:11.170 --> 16:13.572
DISPENSER IN YOUR FRIDGE.

16:13.639 --> 16:14.873
AS FOR BEING "A BRITISH THING,"

16:14.940 --> 16:16.175
THAT'S NOT A GREAT

16:16.241 --> 16:16.875
JUSTIFICATION, EITHER.

16:16.942 --> 16:17.743
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE IS A BRITISH

16:17.810 --> 16:18.344
THING?

16:18.410 --> 16:20.079
MUSHY PEAS.

16:20.145 --> 16:21.413
IF YOU'VE NEVER HAD THE

16:21.480 --> 16:22.781
PLEASURE, IMAGINE EMOTIONALLY

16:22.848 --> 16:24.983
UNAVAILABLE GUACAMOLE.

16:25.050 --> 16:26.185
THEY'RE LIKE IF MASHED POTATOES

16:26.251 --> 16:32.458
KILLED THEMSELVES.

16:32.524 --> 16:32.958
BUT THE FACT IS, 67% OF

16:33.025 --> 16:33.559
PEOPLE IN THE UK FEEL THAT THE

16:33.625 --> 16:34.426
MONARCHY SHOULD REMAIN.

16:34.493 --> 16:36.362
SO FOR NOW, IT SEEMS SECURE

16:36.428 --> 16:36.895
THERE.

16:36.962 --> 16:38.430
BUT THAT BRINGS US TO THE SECOND

16:38.497 --> 16:39.164
PART OF THIS STORY.

16:39.231 --> 16:40.532
BECAUSE ABROAD, THEIR ROLE IS A

16:40.599 --> 16:42.301
MUCH MORE OPEN QUESTION.

16:42.368 --> 16:46.071
CHARLES IS NOW HEAD OF THE

16:46.138 --> 16:47.005
COMMONWEALTH OF NATIONS, A

16:47.072 --> 16:47.940
LOOSE ALLIANCE LARGELY COMPOSED

16:48.006 --> 16:49.074
OF FORMER BRITISH COLONIES,

16:49.141 --> 16:50.776
FOURTEEN OF WHICH STILL HAVE THE

16:50.843 --> 16:52.010
BRITISH MONARCH AS THEIR TITULAR

16:52.077 --> 16:53.979
HEAD OF STATE, IN SPITE OF BEING

16:54.046 --> 16:55.180
SELF-RULING NATIONS.

16:55.247 --> 16:57.182
THESE ARE THOSE COUNTRIES.

16:57.249 --> 16:58.217
AND DEBATES HAVE BEEN RAGING FOR

16:58.283 --> 17:00.152
A WHILE IN MANY OF THEM ABOUT

17:00.219 --> 17:01.186
WHAT THE CROWN REPRESENTS.

17:01.253 --> 17:02.421
AS WE MENTIONED BACK IN MARCH,

17:02.488 --> 17:03.555
WILLIAM AND KATE HAD TO CANCEL

17:03.622 --> 17:05.591
THE FIRST STOP ON THEIR ROYAL

17:05.657 --> 17:07.559
TOUR THROUGH THE CARIBBEAN, DUE

17:07.626 --> 17:08.427
TO OVERWHELMING LOCAL PROTESTS.

17:08.494 --> 17:09.928
AND IN AUSTRALIA, IN THE WAKE OF

17:09.995 --> 17:11.597
THE QUEEN'S DEATH, THE WOMEN'S

17:11.663 --> 17:12.664
AUSSIE-RULES FOOTBALL LEAGUE

17:12.731 --> 17:14.166
HELD A MOMENT OF SILENCE FOR

17:14.233 --> 17:15.334
HER, BUT -- GIVEN THEY WERE, BY

17:15.401 --> 17:17.469
COINCIDENCE, IN THE MIDST OF A

17:17.536 --> 17:19.104
TEN-DAY TRIBUTE TO INDIGENOUS

17:19.171 --> 17:21.206
PLAYERS -- THEY OPTED TO NOT DO

17:21.273 --> 17:21.740
THAT FOR THE REST OF THE

17:21.807 --> 17:23.108
MOURNING PERIOD, PROMPTING THIS

17:23.175 --> 17:25.544
MAN TO FREAK OUT.

17:25.611 --> 17:26.812
>> WHAT A DISGRACE.

17:26.879 --> 17:28.347
SERIOUSLY, I MEAN THAT ANY

17:28.414 --> 17:29.848
SPORTING ORGANIZATION IN THIS

17:29.915 --> 17:31.950
COUNTRY WOULD THINK THERE IS ANY

17:32.017 --> 17:33.719
REASON NOT TO HONOR THE QUEEN IS

17:33.786 --> 17:35.354
A JOKE.

17:35.421 --> 17:37.122
AND WHY CAN'T THEY HAVE A

17:37.189 --> 17:38.424
MINUTE'S SILENCE IN INDIGENOUS

17:38.490 --> 17:40.726
WEEK ANYWAY?

17:40.793 --> 17:41.827
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, INDIGENOUS

17:41.894 --> 17:44.463
PEOPLE ARE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE.

17:44.530 --> 17:47.900
THEY WERE SUBJECTS OF HER

17:47.966 --> 17:48.367
MAJESTY THE QUEEN.

17:48.434 --> 17:49.268
AND YOU CAN

17:49.334 --> 17:50.669
HAVE YOUR ARGUMENTS ABOUT

17:50.736 --> 17:51.637
COLONIALISM OR WHATEVER, BUT THE

17:51.703 --> 17:53.639
QUEEN IN THIS COUNTRY AND FOR

17:53.705 --> 17:55.374
THE WORLD WAS A FORCE FOR GOOD.

17:55.441 --> 17:56.608
>> John: WHAT?

17:56.675 --> 17:58.477
YOU CAN'T JUST GLOSS OVER THE

17:58.544 --> 18:00.145
ENTIRE HISTORY OF COLONIALISM

18:00.212 --> 18:01.313
THERE.

18:01.380 --> 18:02.381
ITS LIKE SAYING, "HAVE ALL THE

18:02.448 --> 18:03.882
ARGUMENTS ABOUT MURDER OR

18:03.949 --> 18:05.818
WHATEVER, BUT AT THE END OF THE

18:05.884 --> 18:07.119
DAY, CHARLES MANSON WAS A FAMILY

18:07.186 --> 18:09.588
MAN."

18:09.655 --> 18:10.789
AND LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT

18:10.856 --> 18:13.025
HISTORY, STARTING IN AUSTRALIA,

18:13.091 --> 18:15.327
WHERE THE INDIGENOUS POPULATION

18:15.394 --> 18:15.961
SUFFERED GREATLY UNDER COLONIAL

18:16.028 --> 18:17.229
RULE.

18:17.296 --> 18:18.931
RESEARCHERS FOUND EVIDENCE FOR,

18:18.997 --> 18:20.165
CONSERVATIVELY, NEARLY 200

18:20.232 --> 18:21.700
MASSACRES OF ABORIGINAL PEOPLE

18:21.767 --> 18:23.101
AT THE HANDS OF THE BRITISH

18:23.168 --> 18:24.703
MILITARY AND COLONIAL POLICE,

18:24.770 --> 18:26.338
AND HUNDREDS MORE BY COLONISTS.

18:26.405 --> 18:28.574
AND WHEN THE QUEEN HERSELF FIRST

18:28.640 --> 18:30.142
VISITED AUSTRALIA IN 1954, FIRST

18:30.209 --> 18:31.643
NATIONS PEOPLE WERE NOT COUNTED

18:31.710 --> 18:33.278
AS PART OF THE POPULATION, AND

18:33.345 --> 18:34.880
CHILDREN WERE STILL BEING

18:34.947 --> 18:36.615
FORCIBLY REMOVED FROM THEIR

18:36.682 --> 18:37.583
FAMILIES TO BE ASSIMILATED INTO

18:37.649 --> 18:39.084
WHITE HOUSEHOLDS.

18:39.151 --> 18:42.087
SO, "HAVE YOUR ARGUMENTS ABOUT

18:42.154 --> 18:43.622
COLONIALISM OR WHATEVER" IS VERY

18:43.689 --> 18:45.524
MUCH WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING,

18:45.591 --> 18:47.292
NOT GLOSSING OVER IT, AND

18:47.359 --> 18:48.794
FORCING PEOPLE TO MOURN A SYMBOL

18:48.861 --> 18:49.928
OF A PAINFUL PAST.

18:49.995 --> 18:51.697
AND THAT'S JUST AUSTRALIA.

18:51.763 --> 18:53.065
IF YOU REALLY WANT TO TALK ABOUT

18:53.131 --> 18:55.167
"COLONIALISM OR WHATEVER," OR

18:55.234 --> 18:56.635
LITIGATE THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE

18:56.702 --> 18:57.569
QUEEN, OR THE MONARCHY IN

18:57.636 --> 18:59.304
GENERAL, HAS BEEN A GLOBAL FORCE

18:59.371 --> 19:01.039
FOR GOOD, LET'S DO THAT.

19:01.106 --> 19:03.108
AND LET'S START WITH THE FULL

19:03.175 --> 19:05.511
EXTENT TO WHICH THE MONARCHY WAS

19:05.577 --> 19:06.712
INTRICATELY INVOLVED IN THE

19:06.778 --> 19:08.413
TRANSATLANTIC SLAVE TRADE.

19:08.480 --> 19:09.848
>> AFTER BRITAIN INVADED JAMAICA

19:09.915 --> 19:11.083
IN 1655, THE ROYAL AFRICAN

19:11.149 --> 19:13.919
COMPANY WAS SET UP BY ROYAL

19:13.986 --> 19:16.722
CHARTER UNDER KING CHARLES II.

19:16.788 --> 19:18.056
THE RAC WENT ON TO TRANSPORT

19:18.123 --> 19:19.992
MORE ENSLAVED AFRICANS TO THE

19:20.058 --> 19:23.595
AMERICAS THAN ANY OTHER SINGLE

19:23.662 --> 19:25.030
INSTITUTION EVER, LINING THE

19:25.097 --> 19:26.665
POCKETS OF THE STUART MONARCHS.

19:26.732 --> 19:28.967
MANY OF THOSE TRAFFICKED WERE

19:29.034 --> 19:31.236
BRANDED WITH THE INITIALS DY, AS

19:31.303 --> 19:32.771
IN THE DUKE OF YORK, WHO LED THE

19:32.838 --> 19:34.473
COMPANY AND LATER BECAME KING

19:34.540 --> 19:37.809
JAMES II.

19:37.876 --> 19:38.310
>> John: THAT'S TRUE.

19:38.377 --> 19:38.944
THE DIRECT ANCESTORS OF TODAY'S

19:39.011 --> 19:40.979
ROYAL FAMILY WERE INVESTORS IN

19:41.046 --> 19:42.648
THE "ROYAL AFRICAN COMPANY" AND

19:42.714 --> 19:45.884
HAD THEIR INITIALS LITERALLY

19:45.951 --> 19:47.185
BRANDED INTO PEOPLE'S SKIN.

19:47.252 --> 19:48.554
AND BOTH THE TRADE OF ENSLAVED

19:48.620 --> 19:49.788
PEOPLE AND THE HIGH-DEMAND

19:49.855 --> 19:50.622
PRODUCTS THEY PRODUCED, LIKE

19:50.689 --> 19:52.224
SUGAR AND TOBACCO, WENT TO

19:52.291 --> 19:55.994
ENRICHING BRITAIN, STRENGTHENING

19:56.061 --> 19:56.828
ITS EMPIRE, AND BY EXTENSION,

19:56.895 --> 19:57.329
FILLING ROYAL COFFERS.

19:57.396 --> 19:57.963
AND I GET THAT PEOPLE SHOULDN'T

19:58.030 --> 19:58.630
BE HELD PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE

19:58.697 --> 20:00.499
FOR WHATEVER THEIR ANCESTORS

20:00.566 --> 20:01.833
DID, BUT TRYING TO TALK ABOUT

20:01.900 --> 20:03.168
THE BRITISH ROLE IN THE SLAVE

20:03.235 --> 20:04.870
TRADE WITHOUT TALKING ABOUT THE

20:04.937 --> 20:07.139
MONARCHY IS SORT OF LIKE TRYING

20:07.205 --> 20:08.941
TO TALK ABOUT JEFFREY EPSTEIN

20:09.007 --> 20:09.474
WITHOUT TALKING ABOUT THE

20:09.541 --> 20:10.676
MONARCHY.

20:10.742 --> 20:12.844
THEY ARE INEXTRICABLY LINKED,

20:12.911 --> 20:14.880
HOWEVER UNCOMFORTABLE THEY MIGHT

20:14.947 --> 20:17.115
FIND THAT FACT.

20:17.182 --> 20:18.016
YET DESPITE ALL THAT, NO ONE IN

20:18.083 --> 20:19.718
THE ROYAL FAMILY HAS EVER

20:19.785 --> 20:20.586
APOLOGIZED ON BEHALF OF THE

20:20.652 --> 20:21.153
CROWN.

20:21.219 --> 20:22.955
INSTEAD THEY'VE TIPTOED AROUND

20:23.021 --> 20:24.189
CULPABILITY WITH PASSIVE-VOICE

20:24.256 --> 20:25.824
STATEMENTS LIKE PRINCE WILLIAM

20:25.891 --> 20:28.060
SAYING "SLAVERY WAS ABHORRENT,"

20:28.126 --> 20:29.261
OR PRINCE CHARLES GOING TO GHANA

20:29.328 --> 20:30.362
AND SAYING THIS.

20:30.429 --> 20:32.164
>> THE APPALLING ATROCITY OF THE

20:32.230 --> 20:36.001
SLAVE TRADE AND THE UNIMAGINABLE

20:36.068 --> 20:38.937
SUFFERING IT CAUSED LEFT AN

20:39.004 --> 20:41.740
INDELIBLE STAIN ON THE HISTORY

20:41.807 --> 20:44.443
OF OUR WORLD.

20:44.509 --> 20:45.677
WHILE BRITAIN COULD BE PROUD

20:45.744 --> 20:47.980
THAT IT LATER LED THE WAY IN THE

20:48.046 --> 20:49.648
ABOLITION OF THIS SHAMEFUL

20:49.715 --> 20:52.284
TRADE, WE HAVE SHARED A

20:52.351 --> 20:55.287
RESPONSIBILITY-WE HAVE A SHARED

20:55.354 --> 20:57.289
RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT

20:57.356 --> 20:58.423
THE ABJECT HORROR OF SLAVERY IS

20:58.490 --> 21:02.761
NEVER FORGOTTEN.

21:02.828 --> 21:03.929
>> John: BUT LISTEN TO THAT, HE

21:03.996 --> 21:05.764
CAN'T EVEN MENTION HOW AWFUL THE

21:05.831 --> 21:06.698
SLAVE TRADE WAS WITHOUT IN THE

21:06.765 --> 21:08.467
SAME BREATH MENTIONING THAT

21:08.533 --> 21:09.801
BRITAIN "LED THE WAY" IN

21:09.868 --> 21:13.038
ABOLISHING IT.

21:13.105 --> 21:13.639
BRITISH PEOPLE LOVE TO TALK

21:13.705 --> 21:14.773
ABOUT THEIR ROLE IN ABOLITION.

21:14.840 --> 21:15.974
BUT CHARLES LEFT A LOT OUT

21:16.041 --> 21:17.009
THERE, INCLUDING THAT, WHILE,

21:17.075 --> 21:19.044
YES, THE BRITISH DID ABOLISH THE

21:19.111 --> 21:20.879
SLAVE "TRADE" IN 1807, IT

21:20.946 --> 21:23.215
ALLOWED PLANTATION SLAVERY TO

21:23.281 --> 21:24.549
PERSIST IN COLONIES FOR DECADES

21:24.616 --> 21:26.151
AFTER, MEANING FULL ABOLITION

21:26.218 --> 21:26.885
DIDN'T FOLLOW FOR ANOTHER

21:26.952 --> 21:27.819
GENERATION.

21:27.886 --> 21:29.921
BUT THE LARGER POINT IS, YOU

21:29.988 --> 21:30.889
CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS.

21:30.956 --> 21:32.524
YOU DON'T GET TO TAKE THE CREDIT

21:32.591 --> 21:33.959
FOR ABOLITION WITHOUT TAKING THE

21:34.026 --> 21:35.861
BLAME FOR WHAT LED UP TO IT.

21:35.927 --> 21:37.596
IF SOMEONE INTENTIONALLY SET

21:37.663 --> 21:39.064
FIRE TO A QUIZNOS, THEN HOURS

21:39.131 --> 21:41.633
LATER PUT THAT FIRE OUT, THEY

21:41.700 --> 21:44.670
WOULDN'T GET TO POST A PICTURE

21:44.736 --> 21:45.237
OF THEMSELVES HOLDING A HOSE

21:45.303 --> 21:45.837
WITH THE CAPTION, "SO I DID A

21:45.904 --> 21:46.204
THING!"

21:46.271 --> 21:50.609
THAT'S NOT THE FULL STORY!

21:50.676 --> 21:51.643
ALSO, FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH, THE

21:51.710 --> 21:52.611
EFFECT OF SLAVERY CLEARLY ISN'T

21:52.678 --> 21:54.546
JUST IN THE PAST.

21:54.613 --> 21:55.947
THE UK WAS PAYING FOR IT -- IN A

21:56.014 --> 21:57.015
VERY LITERAL SENSE -- INCREDIBLY

21:57.082 --> 21:58.684
RECENTLY.

21:58.750 --> 21:59.718
BECAUSE WHEN BRITAIN FINALLY

21:59.785 --> 22:01.286
ABOLISHED SLAVERY IN ITS

22:01.353 --> 22:03.422
COLONIES IN THE 1830S, IT TOOK

22:03.488 --> 22:05.157
OUT A LOAN OF 20 MILLION POUNDS

22:05.223 --> 22:08.560
TO COMPENSATE NOT ENSLAVED

22:08.627 --> 22:11.229
PEOPLE, BUT SLAVE OWNERS, FOR

22:11.296 --> 22:19.571
THE "CONFISCATION OF THEIR

22:19.638 --> 22:20.205
INCOME FROM THEIR PROPERTIES" --

22:20.272 --> 22:20.639
WHICH, TO BE CLEAR,

22:20.706 --> 22:20.939
WAS PEOPLE.

22:21.006 --> 22:21.573
THAT'S ABOUT 17 BILLION POUNDS

22:21.640 --> 22:22.207
IN TODAY'S MONEY, AND UP UNTIL

22:22.274 --> 22:22.841
2015 THE BRITISH STATE WAS STILL

22:22.908 --> 22:23.408
PAYING OFF THE DEBT.

22:23.475 --> 22:24.810
AMAZINGLY, MANY LEARNED ABOUT

22:24.876 --> 22:25.844
THIS FOR THE FIRST TIME WHEN, A

22:25.911 --> 22:26.945
FEW YEARS AGO, THE BRITISH

22:27.012 --> 22:30.816
TREASURY TWEETED, "HERE'S

22:30.882 --> 22:31.483
TODAY'S SURPRISING #FRIDAYFACT

22:31.550 --> 22:32.784
MILLIONS OF YOU HELPED END THE

22:32.851 --> 22:34.186
SLAVE TRADE THROUGH YOUR TAXES."

22:34.252 --> 22:35.487
AND SORRY, BUT THAT'S JUST NOT A

22:35.554 --> 22:37.789
GOOD FRIDAY FACT.

22:37.856 --> 22:39.157
"THE AVERAGE PERSON FARTS

22:39.224 --> 22:39.858
BETWEEN 10 AND 20 TIMES PER

22:39.925 --> 22:42.127
DAY?"

22:42.194 --> 22:42.594
THAT IS PRETTY GOOD.

22:42.661 --> 22:42.994
"FISH CAN COUGH?"

22:43.061 --> 22:44.930
NOW WE'RE TALKING.

22:44.996 --> 22:45.497
"SURPRISE, I KNOW TIMES ARE

22:45.564 --> 22:46.631
TOUGH BUT YOU JUST HELPED PAY

22:46.698 --> 22:47.866
OFF THE FAMILIES OF DEAD

22:47.933 --> 22:51.770
ENSLAVERS?"

22:51.837 --> 22:52.404
NO, ABSOLUTELY FUCKING NOT.

22:52.471 --> 22:53.171
SAVE THAT SHIT FOR MONDAY, YA

22:53.238 --> 22:54.573
BUZZKILL.

22:54.639 --> 22:56.007
AND FOR ANYONE THINKING, "WELL,

22:56.074 --> 22:57.509
THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN ON THE WATCH

22:57.576 --> 22:58.677
OF THE MODERN MONARCHY," IT'S

22:58.744 --> 23:00.612
WORTH KNOWING, ONE OF THE MOST

23:00.679 --> 23:01.413
BRUTAL ATROCITIES CARRIED OUT BY

23:01.480 --> 23:03.782
THE BRITISH ACTUALLY HAPPENED IN

23:03.849 --> 23:05.383
THE FIRST EIGHT YEARS OF

23:05.450 --> 23:06.485
ELIZABETH'S REIGN, AND WHEN

23:06.551 --> 23:08.053
CHARLES WAS ALIVE.

23:08.120 --> 23:09.454
BECAUSE IN THE 1950S, WHILE

23:09.521 --> 23:10.989
KENYA WAS STILL A BRITISH

23:11.056 --> 23:12.424
COLONY, AN ARMED REBELLION WAS

23:12.491 --> 23:13.959
LAUNCHED BY THE KIKUYU PEOPLE

23:14.025 --> 23:15.026
WHO HAD LOST LAND TO WHITE

23:15.093 --> 23:16.128
SETTLERS, AND FOUND THEMSELVES

23:16.194 --> 23:17.362
LOCKED INTO A FORMAL RACIAL

23:17.429 --> 23:19.231
HIERARCHY THAT PLACED EUROPEANS

23:19.297 --> 23:20.065
ON TOP AND AFRICANS AT THE

23:20.132 --> 23:21.166
BOTTOM.

23:21.233 --> 23:22.467
THE BRITISH SENT ARMY

23:22.534 --> 23:25.971
REINFORCEMENTS TO PUT DOWN THE

23:26.037 --> 23:27.572
SO CALLED "MAU MAU UPRISING," A

23:27.639 --> 23:29.808
DECISION IT DESCRIBED TO THE

23:29.875 --> 23:30.342
WORLD BACK THEN LIKE THIS.

23:30.408 --> 23:31.042
>> AGITATORS URGE SOME OF THE

23:31.109 --> 23:32.477
AFRICANS TO FREE THEIR COUNTRY

23:32.544 --> 23:33.578
OF THE WHITE MAN.

23:33.645 --> 23:35.080
THERE IS LITTLE RELIABLE

23:35.147 --> 23:36.314
INFORMATION ABOUT THE SET-UP OF

23:36.381 --> 23:37.983
THE TERRORIST ORGANIZATION FOR

23:38.049 --> 23:39.684
FEW MEMBERS EVEN KNOW FROM WHOM

23:39.751 --> 23:41.019
THEY TAKE THEIR ORDERS.

23:41.086 --> 23:43.288
THEY OBEY BLINDLY, SAVAGELY

23:43.355 --> 23:45.090
ATTACKING THE DEFENSELESS.

23:45.157 --> 23:47.859
BURNING, LOOTING, MURDERING.

23:47.926 --> 23:49.461
KENYA IS A BATTLEFIELD OF A

23:49.528 --> 23:51.396
CONFLICT THAT CANNOT END UNTIL

23:51.463 --> 23:53.131
THE MAU MAU IS DISSOLVED

23:53.198 --> 23:54.399
FOREVER.

23:54.466 --> 23:56.168
>> John: "OH RIGHT-O!

23:56.234 --> 23:57.435
THE TROUBLE IN KEEN-YA COMES NOT

23:57.502 --> 23:58.336
FROM THE BRITISH WHO TOOK OVER

23:58.403 --> 24:00.038
AND STOLE LAND BUT FROM THE

24:00.105 --> 24:02.941
PEOPLE WHOSE LAND WAS STOLEN!

24:03.008 --> 24:03.775
NOW IS THERE MORE TO THIS STORY?

24:03.842 --> 24:04.309
SURELY!

24:04.376 --> 24:04.943
BUT WILL YOU HEAR IT COME FROM A

24:05.010 --> 24:06.812
VOICE THAT SOUNDS LIKE THIS?

24:06.878 --> 24:10.916
I SAY NEVER!"

24:10.982 --> 24:11.416
NEVER I SAY!

24:11.483 --> 24:12.017
IN CRUSHING THE UPRISING, THE

24:12.083 --> 24:12.617
BRITISH INSTITUTED A SYSTEM OF

24:12.684 --> 24:14.886
DETENTION CAMPS, AND 90,000

24:14.953 --> 24:17.722
KENYANS WERE EXECUTED, TORTURED

24:17.789 --> 24:18.557
OR MAIMED DURING THE CRACKDOWN,

24:18.623 --> 24:19.291
AND AN ESTIMATED 160,000 WERE

24:19.357 --> 24:19.858
DETAINED IN APPALLING

24:19.925 --> 24:22.060
CONDITIONS.

24:22.127 --> 24:25.130
FOR A LONG TIME THE BRITISH MET

24:25.197 --> 24:26.298
OUTCRY OVER THIS WITH A MIXTURE

24:26.364 --> 24:27.766
OF DENIAL AND DEFENSIVENESS.

24:27.833 --> 24:29.000
JUST WATCH THIS INTERVIEW WITH A

24:29.067 --> 24:30.235
FORMER BRITISH COLONIAL OFFICER,

24:30.302 --> 24:31.403
WHO'D BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR AT

24:31.469 --> 24:33.171
LEAST SIX OF THOSE DETENTION

24:33.238 --> 24:34.039
CAMPS.

24:34.105 --> 24:35.340
WHEN ASKED ABOUT REPORTS THAT

24:35.407 --> 24:38.176
SOLDIERS HAD PUT THEIR FEET ON

24:38.243 --> 24:38.877
THE NECKS OF DETAINEES UNTIL

24:38.944 --> 24:39.678
THEY SCREAMED, HE HAS AN

24:39.744 --> 24:40.312
ESCALATING EXCHANGE CULMINATING

24:40.378 --> 24:41.847
IN THE LONGEST PAUSE YOU'LL EVER

24:41.913 --> 24:44.082
SEE ON TELEVISION.

24:44.149 --> 24:44.916
I'LL WARN YOU -- HOWEVER LONG

24:44.983 --> 24:46.017
YOU THINK THIS PAUSE IS GOING TO

24:46.084 --> 24:50.922
BE, IT'S MUCH LONGER.

24:50.989 --> 24:51.590
>> DID YOU HAVE CAUSE TO GIVE

24:51.656 --> 24:52.424
THE ORDER TO OR YOURSELF PUT

24:52.490 --> 24:55.160
YOUR BOOT ON THEIR NECK OF THESE

24:55.227 --> 24:55.894
RESISTERS, THE ONES THAT WERE

24:55.961 --> 25:04.002
HOWLING?

25:04.069 --> 25:05.070
>> UMM, CAN WE STOP TALKING FOR

25:05.136 --> 25:05.337
A MOMENT?

25:05.403 --> 25:06.004
>> NO, 'CAUSE I'D QUITE LIKE YOU

25:06.071 --> 25:06.471
TO ANSWER THAT.

25:06.538 --> 25:07.105
>> I WILL ANSWER IT WHEN I HAVE

25:07.172 --> 25:10.609
STOPPED TALKING FOR A MOMENT.

25:10.675 --> 25:11.977
I'M SORRY, BUT I -- I --

25:12.043 --> 25:13.345
>> WELL, DO YOU HAVE A PROBLEM

25:13.411 --> 25:14.212
WITH THAT QUESTION?

25:14.279 --> 25:18.917
>> NO, IT'S -- IT'S A

25:18.984 --> 25:20.285
HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION.

25:20.352 --> 25:20.819
>> NO, IT'S NOT.

25:20.886 --> 25:22.153
IT'S A VERY PRECISE QUESTION.

25:22.220 --> 25:24.556
>> YOU'VE ASKED ME, "DID I PUT

25:24.623 --> 25:25.957
MY FOOT ON ANYBODY'S NECK?"

25:26.024 --> 25:26.791
NO.

25:26.858 --> 25:27.459
>> DID YOU CAUSE THE ORDER TO BE

25:27.525 --> 25:27.659
GIVEN?

25:27.726 --> 25:28.260
DID YOU GIVE THE ORDER TO DO

25:28.326 --> 25:52.083
THAT?

25:52.150 --> 25:53.351
ARE YOU NOT GOING TO ANSWER THE

25:53.418 --> 25:53.718
QUESTION?

25:53.785 --> 25:56.788
>> NO, I AM LOOKING AT YOU WITH

25:56.855 --> 25:59.491
CERTAIN THOUGHTS IN MY MIND.

25:59.557 --> 26:00.926
>> John: HOLY SHIT!

26:00.992 --> 26:02.494
IF YOU'RE TRYING TO CONCEAL YOUR

26:02.560 --> 26:05.163
ROLE IN SUPERVISING TORTURE,

26:05.230 --> 26:05.997
HERE'S A FEW TIPS: DON'T RESPOND

26:06.064 --> 26:07.632
TO A SIMPLE QUESTION BY TAKING A

26:07.699 --> 26:09.367
FULL 23 SECONDS TO ANSWER.

26:09.434 --> 26:10.335
DON'T THEN ISSUE A VAGUE THREAT

26:10.402 --> 26:12.337
LIKE SOME CARTOON VILLAIN.

26:12.404 --> 26:14.205
AND FINALLY, TRY NOT TO GLARE

26:14.272 --> 26:15.307
MALEVOLENTLY AT THE INTERVIEWER

26:15.373 --> 26:16.274
WITH WHAT I CAN ONLY DESCRIBE AS

26:16.341 --> 26:19.177
"WAR CRIME EYES."

26:19.244 --> 26:21.413
AND JUST TO BE CLEAR, WE DON'T

26:21.479 --> 26:22.447
KNOW WHAT THE QUEEN KNEW.

26:22.514 --> 26:24.015
WHAT SHE'S BRIEFED ON IS KEPT

26:24.082 --> 26:25.617
SECRET, CONVENIENTLY.

26:25.684 --> 26:27.052
BUT WE DO KNOW WHAT WAS DONE IN

26:27.118 --> 26:29.387
HER NAME, BY HER GOVERNMENT.

26:29.454 --> 26:30.822
HER FACE WAS ON THE MONEY IN

26:30.889 --> 26:32.023
KENYA.

26:32.090 --> 26:33.692
WHEN KENYANS' CAPTORS SANG THEIR

26:33.758 --> 26:34.726
NATIONAL ANTHEM, IT WAS A HYMN

26:34.793 --> 26:36.061
TO HER PROTECTION.

26:36.127 --> 26:37.529
AND WE DO KNOW SHE WAS NOT ONLY

26:37.595 --> 26:41.733
CHARACTERISTICALLY SILENT ABOUT

26:41.800 --> 26:45.236
THOSE ATROCITIES

26:45.303 --> 26:45.570
YOU KNOW, IN

26:45.637 --> 26:46.438
THAT CHARMING STYLE EVERYBODY

26:46.504 --> 26:50.909
LOVED -- BUT SHE ALSO AWARDED

26:50.976 --> 26:51.476
THAT MAN AN MBE, ONE OF THE

26:51.543 --> 26:52.010
COUNTRY'S HIGHEST HONORS.

26:52.077 --> 26:52.644
WHICH IS APPALLING, UNLESS THE

26:52.711 --> 26:54.012
"MBE" STANDS FOR "MESSIEST BITCH

26:54.079 --> 26:54.612
EVER," IN WHICH CASE, I GUESS

26:54.679 --> 26:57.082
THAT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE.

26:57.148 --> 26:57.782
AND THAT'S THE THING, IF

26:57.849 --> 26:59.384
YOU'RE THE SYMBOL OF A COUNTRY,

26:59.451 --> 27:01.619
YOU REPRESENT WHAT IT DOES.

27:01.686 --> 27:02.253
AND IT'S REVEALING THAT, EVEN

27:02.320 --> 27:03.621
DECADES LATER, WHEN THE BRITISH

27:03.688 --> 27:08.259
FINALLY AGREED TO PAY

27:08.326 --> 27:08.860
COMPENSATION TO A FRACTION OF

27:08.927 --> 27:09.594
THOSE WHO SUFFERED IN KENYA,

27:09.661 --> 27:11.096
THIS WOMAN WAS CLEAR ABOUT WHO

27:11.162 --> 27:13.365
SHE WANTED TO HEAR FROM.

27:13.431 --> 27:14.466
>> MUTHONI MATHENGE IS ONE OF

27:14.532 --> 27:15.767
THE FEW SURVIVING MAU MAU

27:15.834 --> 27:17.902
INDEPENDENCE FIGHTERS IN KENYA.

27:17.969 --> 27:19.337
BRITAIN HAS APOLOGIZED FOR SOME

27:19.404 --> 27:21.840
ABUSES, BUT MATHENGE DID NOT GET

27:21.906 --> 27:24.042
A COMPENSATION PAID TO OTHER

27:24.109 --> 27:24.709
REBELS.

27:24.776 --> 27:27.012
SHE IS CALLING ON THE QUEEN FOR

27:27.078 --> 27:29.914
HELP BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

27:29.981 --> 27:31.483
>> LET ELIZABETH BRING WHAT

27:31.549 --> 27:32.150
BELONGS TO ME.

27:32.217 --> 27:33.218
THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO SAY.

27:33.284 --> 27:36.087
NO MIDDLEMEN IN BETWEEN.

27:36.154 --> 27:37.989
LET THE COMPENSATION COME

27:38.056 --> 27:38.890
DIRECTLY TO ME.

27:38.957 --> 27:40.658
SHE SHOULD LOOK FOR A SENSIBLE

27:40.725 --> 27:42.127
PERSON AND SEND IT HERE.

27:42.193 --> 27:45.597
>> John: YEAH, THAT'S

27:45.663 --> 27:46.164
COMPLETELY UNDERSTANDABLE.

27:46.231 --> 27:46.664
PARTICULARLY THE "SEND A

27:46.731 --> 27:47.332
SENSIBLE PERSON" POINT.

27:47.399 --> 27:48.333
BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH

27:48.400 --> 27:49.834
THE ROYAL FAMILY, IT'S WORTH

27:49.901 --> 27:50.769
REMEMBER THAT UNLESS YOU

27:50.835 --> 27:52.003
STIPULATE OTHERWISE, YOU COULD

27:52.070 --> 27:53.271
END UP BEING SENT SOMEONE LIKE

27:53.338 --> 27:55.206
THIS.

27:55.273 --> 27:56.074
>> AH!

27:56.141 --> 27:57.375
DIG THAT CRAZY RHYTHM!

27:57.442 --> 28:02.547
>> John: EXACTLY.

28:02.614 --> 28:05.083
AND NOBODY WANTS THAT, NOBODY!

28:05.150 --> 28:05.650
YOU CAN'T SAY YOU'RE JUST A

28:05.717 --> 28:06.084
SYMBOL AND BEAR NO

28:06.151 --> 28:06.851
RESPONSIBILITY FOR HOW THE

28:06.918 --> 28:08.286
INSTITUTIONS YOU'RE THE HEAD OF

28:08.353 --> 28:09.387
BEHAVE.

28:09.454 --> 28:10.822
TAKE THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND, OF

28:10.889 --> 28:12.090
WHICH THE MONARCH IS THE HEAD.

28:12.157 --> 28:13.525
IN CANADA, IT PLAYED A ROLE IN

28:13.591 --> 28:14.592
THEIR SYSTEM OF RESIDENTIAL

28:14.659 --> 28:16.227
SCHOOLS FOR INDIGENOUS CHILDREN,

28:16.294 --> 28:17.695
WHO WERE FORCIBLY SEPARATED FROM

28:17.762 --> 28:19.664
THEIR FAMILIES AND SENT TO

28:19.731 --> 28:20.832
GOVERNMENT-FUNDED, CHURCH-RUN

28:20.899 --> 28:23.334
BOARDING SCHOOLS IN ATTEMPT TO

28:23.401 --> 28:23.701
ASSIMILATE THEM.

28:23.768 --> 28:24.836
HORRIFIC ABUSES HAPPENED IN

28:24.903 --> 28:25.970
THOSE SCHOOLS.

28:26.037 --> 28:27.705
AND WHILE THEY WERE LARGELY RUN

28:27.772 --> 28:28.907
BY THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, THE

28:28.973 --> 28:30.275
CHURCH OF ENGLAND OPERATED

28:30.341 --> 28:31.709
APPROXIMATELY THREE DOZEN OF

28:31.776 --> 28:33.678
THEM, GIVING UP CONTROL OF THE

28:33.745 --> 28:36.114
LAST ONE IN 1969, WHICH IS

28:36.181 --> 28:37.282
PRETTY FUCKING RECENT.

28:37.348 --> 28:38.516
EARLIER THIS YEAR, CHARLES

28:38.583 --> 28:39.818
VISITED CANADA AND MADE A POINT

28:39.884 --> 28:41.319
OF SHOWING UP AT A GARDEN THAT

28:41.386 --> 28:42.454
PAID TRIBUTE TO THE VICTIMS OF

28:42.520 --> 28:43.321
THOSE SCHOOLS.

28:43.388 --> 28:45.323
BUT WHEN IT CAME TO SHOWING

28:45.390 --> 28:46.157
REMORSE FOR WHAT HAD HAPPENED,

28:46.224 --> 28:46.958
THAT SEEMED TO BE OFF THE TABLE.

28:47.025 --> 28:48.726
BECAUSE JUST LISTEN TO ONE

28:48.793 --> 28:50.028
INDIGENOUS LEADER WHO BRIEFLY

28:50.095 --> 28:51.596
SPOKE WITH CHARLES THAT DAY

28:51.663 --> 28:53.798
DESCRIBE THEIR ENTIRE EXCHANGE.

28:53.865 --> 28:56.434
>> HE DID SAY, "I HOPE WE

28:56.501 --> 28:57.936
WEREN'T TOO BAD ON YOU."

28:58.002 --> 28:59.337
I DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO RESPOND

28:59.404 --> 29:00.805
SO HE MOVED ON.

29:00.872 --> 29:02.574
THE PRINCE, WHILE LEADING THIS

29:02.640 --> 29:04.075
COUNTRY, HE SHOULD APOLOGIZE TO

29:04.142 --> 29:06.578
THE ABORIGINAL PEOPLE FOR THIS

29:06.644 --> 29:08.046
TRAUMA THAT WE'VE GONE THROUGH

29:08.113 --> 29:09.547
FOR 500 YEARS.

29:09.614 --> 29:10.281
>> John: WOW.

29:10.348 --> 29:12.283
"I HOPE WE WEREN'T TOO BAD ON

29:12.350 --> 29:13.651
YOU," HE SAID, BEFORE WALKING

29:13.718 --> 29:14.185
AWAY.

29:14.252 --> 29:16.621
WHICH I KNOW SEEMS BAD, BUT AS A

29:16.688 --> 29:21.726
SYMBOL OF BRITAIN, IT'S PRETTY

29:21.793 --> 29:22.794
ON-BRAND HONESTLY.

29:22.861 --> 29:32.203
"YOU KEEP CALM.

29:32.270 --> 29:33.238
AND IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I'LL

29:33.304 --> 29:33.505
CARRY ON."

29:33.571 --> 29:34.005
AND LOOK, I KNOW, ACROSS

29:34.072 --> 29:34.606
COMMONWEALTH COUNTRIES, THERE

29:34.672 --> 29:35.273
ARE A RANGE OF VIEWS, ESPECIALLY

29:35.340 --> 29:35.874
AMONG THE OLDER GENERATION --

29:35.940 --> 29:36.474
AS, INCREDIBLY, EVEN SOME WHO

29:36.541 --> 29:37.108
SUFFERED UNDER BRITISH RULE CAN

29:37.175 --> 29:37.775
FEEL STRONG AFFECTION FOR THE

29:37.842 --> 29:38.443
QUEEN PERSONALLY, EVEN IF THEY

29:38.510 --> 29:39.344
DIDN'T LOVE WHAT SHE

29:39.410 --> 29:39.711
REPRESENTED.

29:39.777 --> 29:40.879
AND SOME ARGUE, "IF THE ROYAL

29:40.945 --> 29:42.313
FAMILY'S JUST CEREMONIAL NOW,

29:42.380 --> 29:43.681
WHERE'S THE REAL HARM?"

29:43.748 --> 29:45.583
BUT THE CEREMONIAL CAN STILL

29:45.650 --> 29:46.985
HAVE THE POWER TO INFURIATE.

29:47.051 --> 29:47.952
AND TO SEE THAT, LET'S GO BACK

29:48.019 --> 29:49.487
TO AUSTRALIA.

29:49.554 --> 29:50.889
BECAUSE SHORTLY BEFORE THE QUEEN

29:50.955 --> 29:52.090
DIED, LIDIA THORPE, AN

29:52.157 --> 29:53.758
INDIGENOUS AUSTRALIAN SENATOR

29:53.825 --> 29:55.293
WAS TAKING THE OATH OF OFFICE,

29:55.360 --> 29:56.528
WHICH REQUIRED HER TO SWEAR

29:56.594 --> 29:57.529
ALLEGIANCE TO THE QUEEN.

29:57.595 --> 29:59.497
SOMETHING SHE UNDERSTANDABLY HAD

29:59.564 --> 30:01.032
A BIT OF A PROBLEM WITH, SO THIS

30:01.099 --> 30:01.833
IS WHAT SHE DID.

30:01.900 --> 30:05.270
>> PLEASE RECITE THE AFFIRMATION

30:05.336 --> 30:08.840
ON THE CARD HANDED TO YOU.

30:08.907 --> 30:09.908
>> I, SOVEREIGN LIDIA THORPE, DO

30:09.974 --> 30:13.878
SOLEMNLY AND SINCERELY AFFIRM

30:13.945 --> 30:15.513
AND DECLARE THAT I WILL BE

30:15.580 --> 30:18.316
FAITHFUL, AND I BEAR TRUE

30:18.383 --> 30:21.452
ALLEGIANCE TO THE COLONIZING HER

30:21.519 --> 30:22.020
MAJESTY QUEEN ELIZABETH II.

30:22.086 --> 30:22.954
>> SENATOR THORPE -- SENATOR

30:23.021 --> 30:24.389
THORPE, YOU ARE REQUIRED TO

30:24.455 --> 30:26.691
RECITE THE OATH AS PRINTED ON

30:26.758 --> 30:27.725
THE CARD.

30:27.792 --> 30:28.726
>> John: YEAH, THEY ACTUALLY

30:28.793 --> 30:30.361
FORCED HER TO READ WHAT WAS

30:30.428 --> 30:35.333
PRINTED ON THE CARD, VERBATIM.

30:35.400 --> 30:37.335
SO SHE DID THAT, BUT CREDIT TO

30:37.402 --> 30:38.870
HER -- BECAUSE SHE THEN EMPLOYED

30:38.937 --> 30:39.604
A TONE OF VOICE THAT DID A "LOT"

30:39.671 --> 30:40.271
OF HEAVY LIFTING.

30:40.338 --> 30:40.905
>> I, LIDIA THORPE, DO SOLEMNLY

30:40.972 --> 30:44.309
AND SINCERELY AFFIRM AND DECLARE

30:44.375 --> 30:46.778
THAT I WILL BE FAITHFUL AND BEAR

30:46.844 --> 30:53.117
TRUE ALLEGIANCE TO HER MAJESTY

30:53.184 --> 30:54.152
QUEEN ELIZABETH II, HER HEIRS,

30:54.219 --> 31:00.058
AND SUCCESSORS ACCORDING TO LAW.

31:00.124 --> 31:01.459
>> John: OKAY, I HATE THAT SHE

31:01.526 --> 31:02.360
WAS FORCED TO DO THAT, BUT I

31:02.427 --> 31:04.229
ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE WAY SHE WAS

31:04.295 --> 31:05.964
ABLE TO MAKE A PLEDGE TO A FANCY

31:06.030 --> 31:06.564
OLD LADY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF

31:06.631 --> 31:09.100
THE WORLD SOUND EXACTLY AS

31:09.167 --> 31:11.236
STUPID AS IT FUCKING IS.

31:11.302 --> 31:12.870
AND LOOK, TO GO BY RECENT POLLS,

31:12.937 --> 31:13.871
AUSTRALIA -- LIKE THE UK --

31:13.938 --> 31:15.473
SEEMS UNLIKELY TO LET GO OF THE

31:15.540 --> 31:17.375
MONARCHY ANYTIME SOON.

31:17.442 --> 31:19.611
BUT OTHER COMMONWEALTH COUNTRIES

31:19.677 --> 31:21.179
ARE ALREADY PREPARING TO DO SO.

31:21.246 --> 31:22.847
LAST YEAR, BARBADOS REMOVED THE

31:22.914 --> 31:23.848
QUEEN AS HEAD OF STATE.

31:23.915 --> 31:25.216
JAMAICA IS LOOKING TO HAVE A

31:25.283 --> 31:26.551
REFERENDUM TO DO THE SAME WITHIN

31:26.618 --> 31:27.552
THE NEXT THREE YEARS, WITH ONE

31:27.619 --> 31:29.354
POLL SHOWING A MAJORITY SUPPORTS

31:29.420 --> 31:31.189
IT.

31:31.256 --> 31:32.557
AND ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA, GRENADA

31:32.624 --> 31:33.191
AND BELIZE SEEM TO BE MOVING IN

31:33.258 --> 31:35.193
THE SAME DIRECTION.

31:35.260 --> 31:35.994
AND WHILE THE ROYAL FAMILY'S

31:36.060 --> 31:37.629
SAID THESE COUNTRIES ARE FREE TO

31:37.695 --> 31:38.630
LEAVE IF THEY SO CHOOSE, THEY

31:38.696 --> 31:40.732
ALSO REFUSE TO RECKON WITH WHY

31:40.798 --> 31:42.033
THEY MIGHT WANT TO DO THAT IN

31:42.100 --> 31:43.134
THE FIRST PLACE.

31:43.201 --> 31:44.802
INSTEAD, THEY'VE CONTINUED

31:44.869 --> 31:45.903
WORKING HARD TO BE PERCEIVED AS

31:45.970 --> 31:47.138
A MERE "SYMBOL," WHILE NEVER

31:47.205 --> 31:49.907
TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT

31:49.974 --> 31:50.708
THAT SYMBOL EXCUSED -- ALL WHILE

31:50.775 --> 31:51.876
IGNORING CALLS FOR TRUE

31:51.943 --> 31:53.845
APOLOGIES AND REPARATIONS TO

31:53.911 --> 31:55.346
THOSE WHO SUFFERED TREMENDOUSLY

31:55.413 --> 31:57.382
BECAUSE OF WHAT WAS DONE IN

31:57.448 --> 31:58.583
THEIR NAME.

31:58.650 --> 32:00.418
AND LOOK, YOU DON'T HAVE TO HATE

32:00.485 --> 32:02.453
THE ROYAL FAMILY PERSONALLY.

32:02.520 --> 32:03.288
I MEAN, GOOGLE "PRINCE PHILIP

32:03.354 --> 32:04.889
RACISM" OR "PRINCE ANDREW

32:04.956 --> 32:05.723
EVERYTHING" AND SEE WHERE YOU

32:05.790 --> 32:07.158
LAND.

32:07.225 --> 32:09.761
YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO THINK THE

32:09.827 --> 32:11.362
INSTITUTION SHOULDN'T EXIST.

32:11.429 --> 32:14.065
BUT IF IT'S GOING TO, IT'S FAIR

32:14.132 --> 32:15.566
TO EXPECT SIGNIFICANTLY MORE

32:15.633 --> 32:16.868
FROM THEM.

32:16.934 --> 32:17.602
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW, FAR TOO

32:17.669 --> 32:25.176
OFTEN, THEY HIDE BEHIND THE

32:25.243 --> 32:25.677
SHIELD OF POLITENESS AND

32:25.743 --> 32:26.210
MANNERS, WHICH FREQUENTLY

32:26.277 --> 32:26.811
DEMANDS THE SILENCE OF ANYONE

32:26.878 --> 32:27.378
WHO MIGHT CRITICIZE THEM, OR

32:27.445 --> 32:27.845
WHAT THEY STAND FOR.

32:27.912 --> 32:28.446
WILL THIS SEGMENT EVEN AIR ON

32:28.513 --> 32:30.348
SKY IN BRITAIN?

32:30.415 --> 32:31.749
I DUNNO.

32:31.816 --> 32:32.550
MAYBE.

32:32.617 --> 32:34.085
MAYBE NOT.

32:34.152 --> 32:36.654
BUT IF THEY DO CUT IT FOR BEING

32:36.721 --> 32:37.488
DISRESPECTFUL, THEY MIGHT WANT

32:37.555 --> 32:39.957
TO THINK ABOUT WHY.

32:40.024 --> 32:41.059
WHY THEY, AND EVERYONE ELSE, ARE

32:41.125 --> 32:42.593
WORKING SO HARD NOT TO OFFEND A

32:42.660 --> 32:44.128
FAMILY WHOSE NAME WAS BRANDED

32:44.195 --> 32:47.532
INTO PEOPLE'S SKIN, AND WHO SIT

32:47.598 --> 32:48.833
ATOP A PILE OF STOLEN WEALTH,

32:48.900 --> 32:50.134
WEARING CROWNS ADORNED WITH

32:50.201 --> 32:51.536
OTHER COUNTRIES' TREASURES.

32:51.602 --> 32:56.207
AND IF THERE'S AN ANSWER TO

32:56.274 --> 32:56.808
THAT, I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR IT,

32:56.874 --> 32:57.442
THOUGH IF HISTORY IS ANY GUIDE,

32:57.508 --> 32:58.409
I'M GUESSING I'M JUST GOING TO

32:58.476 --> 32:59.877
GET AN ICY STARE WHILE YOU THINK

32:59.944 --> 33:01.846
CERTAIN THOUGHTS IN YOUR HEAD.

33:01.913 --> 33:03.648
BUT I REALLY HOPE THEY DON'T CUT

33:03.715 --> 33:04.148
THIS PIECE.

33:04.215 --> 33:08.586
PARTLY BECAUSE THIS IS A

33:08.653 --> 33:10.788
LONG OVERDUE CONVERSATION THAT

33:10.855 --> 33:13.391
NEEDS TO BE HAD, AND PARTLY

33:13.458 --> 33:15.893
BECAUSE NO AUDIENCE DESERVES TO

33:15.960 --> 33:16.494
BE SUBJECTED TO 25 MINUTES OF

33:16.561 --> 33:17.328
THIS.
