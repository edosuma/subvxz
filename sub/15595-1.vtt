04:12.239 --> 04:14.107
Remi!

04:14.174 --> 04:16.276
Remi, look!

04:16.343 --> 04:18.579
I got you a surprise.

04:21.281 --> 04:23.016
Wiener-Dog!

04:28.756 --> 04:31.258
Now who's gonna walk it?

04:31.324 --> 04:33.260
I'll walk it.

04:33.326 --> 04:34.828
And Remi will pitch in, too.

04:34.895 --> 04:36.564
You don't have to
if you don't want to.

04:36.630 --> 04:37.898
Damn right I don't have to.

04:37.965 --> 04:39.533
But tell me
who's going to clean up

04:39.600 --> 04:41.034
after it shits all over
the living room floor.

04:41.101 --> 04:43.804
Remi understands.
He's not a little kid.

04:43.871 --> 04:46.106
He's a fucking survivor!

04:50.644 --> 04:52.813
His hair is all grown back.

04:52.880 --> 04:54.482
The doctor said
it would be fine

04:54.515 --> 04:57.050
as long as he keeps up
with the blood work.

04:57.117 --> 04:59.720
And now he's got all summer
to learn how to housebreak it.

04:59.787 --> 05:02.490
It's gonna be good for him.

05:02.556 --> 05:04.525
Fucking asshole.

05:32.185 --> 05:34.354
Shh.
It's okay.

05:34.421 --> 05:36.089
It's okay, Wiener-Dog.

05:36.156 --> 05:37.658
I'm here.

05:39.527 --> 05:41.294
Shh.

05:41.361 --> 05:45.198
Heel!
Heel!

05:46.534 --> 05:48.401
Heel! Goddamn it!

05:48.536 --> 05:50.638
Heel!

05:50.704 --> 05:52.072
Motherfucker! Heel.

05:52.139 --> 05:54.742
Heel, motherfucker.
Heel, motherfucker.

06:07.054 --> 06:08.689
Hey, Dad,
when do you think

06:08.756 --> 06:11.725
we can let Wiener-Dog
out of her cage?

06:14.227 --> 06:17.064
When she's housebroken.

06:17.130 --> 06:20.568
Why do people
say "housebroken"?

06:20.601 --> 06:22.402
Because...

06:22.469 --> 06:26.006
Remi, you have to break a dog,

06:26.073 --> 06:27.775
break their will,

06:27.841 --> 06:31.244
so that they'll submit
to your will.

06:31.311 --> 06:34.314
It's a kind of civilizing.

06:34.381 --> 06:36.750
So they act like humans.

06:39.086 --> 06:42.155
You mean so they go
to the bathroom outside

06:42.222 --> 06:44.391
instead of inside?

06:44.457 --> 06:46.193
Exactly.

06:50.397 --> 06:52.966
But when you break a will,

06:53.033 --> 06:54.935
well...

06:55.002 --> 06:59.272
What is a will exactly, anyway?

06:59.339 --> 07:01.809
It's character.

07:01.875 --> 07:04.812
Force of character.

07:04.878 --> 07:08.782
It's the thing
that makes you you.

07:32.640 --> 07:34.374
Hey, Remi, it's time!

07:34.441 --> 07:36.209
We have to go the vet!

07:47.320 --> 07:50.157
- Mom?
- Yes, honey?

07:50.223 --> 07:52.159
What's "spaying" mean?

07:52.225 --> 07:54.294
It just means, this way,
we don't have to worry

07:54.361 --> 07:55.829
about the dog getting pregnant.

07:55.896 --> 07:57.831
What do they do to her?

07:57.898 --> 08:00.701
Really, it's nothing.
She won't know any different.

08:00.768 --> 08:02.002
Does it hurt?

08:02.069 --> 08:03.737
No, really, it happens so fast,

08:03.804 --> 08:05.839
she won't even
know what happened.

08:05.906 --> 08:08.141
But what do they do to her?

08:08.208 --> 08:11.044
You know, honey,
I'm really not sure.

08:11.111 --> 08:14.547
I mean, all dogs get this done.

08:14.682 --> 08:16.416
Really, it's like going
to the dentist

08:16.483 --> 08:17.685
and having your teeth cleaned.

08:17.685 --> 08:19.019
No big deal.

08:19.086 --> 08:22.189
But what if Wiener-Dog
wants to have puppies.

08:22.255 --> 08:25.092
She won't.
Believe me, that's a total myth.

08:25.158 --> 08:27.761
But what
if Wiener-Dog's different?

08:27.828 --> 08:29.496
Honey, she's not.

08:29.562 --> 08:31.364
She's not like you and me.

08:31.431 --> 08:32.966
She doesn't think this way.

08:33.033 --> 08:35.268
She doesn't think.
I mean, she's just a dog.

08:35.335 --> 08:37.337
But she has feelings.

08:37.404 --> 08:41.207
Oh, sweetheart, I know,
and you're right.

08:41.274 --> 08:44.311
But with a dog,
things are different.

08:44.377 --> 08:46.046
A dog is not human.

08:46.113 --> 08:47.715
It's an animal.

08:47.748 --> 08:49.349
They look to us for guidance.

08:49.416 --> 08:51.618
Without us,
they wouldn't even be here.

08:51.719 --> 08:53.721
What do you mean?

08:53.754 --> 08:55.588
Nature doesn't care about them.

08:55.723 --> 08:57.557
It's sad but true.

08:57.624 --> 09:01.094
We're dog's only friend.

09:01.161 --> 09:02.529
Can I watch?

09:02.595 --> 09:05.065
No, definitely not.

09:05.132 --> 09:07.600
The doctor has to be able
to concentrate.

09:07.735 --> 09:10.070
I won't say anything.

09:10.137 --> 09:12.840
I'm sorry, Remi,
but it's just not allowed.

09:12.906 --> 09:15.242
But Wiener-Dog will be scared.

09:15.308 --> 09:17.911
I know she'll want
to hold my hand.

09:17.978 --> 09:20.513
Wiener-Dog will be fine.
Really.

09:20.580 --> 09:23.550
But if you're there with her,
you'll bring in germs with you.

09:23.616 --> 09:26.286
It would be just like
when during intensification,

09:26.353 --> 09:28.255
remember, all the nausea

09:28.321 --> 09:30.390
and then all sorts
of complications

09:30.457 --> 09:33.761
could start up...
Serious complications.

09:33.827 --> 09:36.129
Like what?

09:39.299 --> 09:41.068
She could die.

09:50.610 --> 09:52.379
All right, then.

10:01.354 --> 10:04.224
Run!
Run, Wiener-Dog, run!

10:04.291 --> 10:06.126
Run, run!

10:06.193 --> 10:08.028
Oh!

10:08.095 --> 10:09.797
Remi!

10:25.779 --> 10:27.547
Oh!

10:27.614 --> 10:30.417
Well, I don't think
there'll be any barking tonight.

10:34.387 --> 10:35.789
Way to go.

10:50.303 --> 10:53.640
Hi, honey.

10:53.706 --> 10:55.442
Honey.

10:58.211 --> 10:59.847
Hi.

10:59.880 --> 11:02.282
You know, when I was
a little girl in France,

11:02.349 --> 11:05.485
we had a little dog also...
A poodle.

11:05.552 --> 11:07.554
My mother
found her at the animal shelter,

11:07.620 --> 11:09.156
and she decided to take her in

11:09.222 --> 11:13.426
because she was so cute
and cuddly and sweet and funny.

11:13.493 --> 11:14.928
We named her Croissant

11:14.995 --> 11:17.497
because she loved croissants
so much.

11:17.564 --> 11:20.400
But then, a few months
after she moved in,

11:20.467 --> 11:23.003
she suddenly started getting
a little tired,

11:23.070 --> 11:24.872
like she was depressed.

11:24.905 --> 11:27.875
All her happy spirit
seemed to have vanished.

11:27.908 --> 11:30.878
And that's when we found
out she was pregnant.

11:30.878 --> 11:33.413
Who was the father?

11:33.480 --> 11:36.884
Well, turns out...

11:36.950 --> 11:38.451
she was raped.

11:39.953 --> 11:41.889
What do you mean?

11:41.889 --> 11:45.392
Well, it was a stray dog
in the woods.

11:45.458 --> 11:48.395
He was called Muhammad.

11:48.461 --> 11:50.663
Hair all matted
and scratched up,

11:50.730 --> 11:52.199
all oily and ugly...

11:52.265 --> 11:54.401
The kind of dog
that growled and snarled,

11:54.467 --> 11:56.904
the kind of dog that has
rabies or ticks

11:56.937 --> 11:59.272
or even worse.

11:59.339 --> 12:01.074
Like what?

12:01.141 --> 12:03.610
Like possibly...

12:03.676 --> 12:05.745
a venereal disease.

12:05.812 --> 12:08.148
You mean like...

12:08.215 --> 12:09.983
AIDS?

12:12.185 --> 12:15.422
Anyway, at the end,
Croissant became very sick.

12:15.488 --> 12:19.159
All her hair
started falling out, her teeth.

12:19.226 --> 12:22.029
Oh, it was too horrible.

12:22.095 --> 12:25.032
And then when she gave birth,
she was in so much pain.

12:25.098 --> 12:27.167
We gave her as many painkillers
as we could,

12:27.234 --> 12:29.769
but she wouldn't
stop whimpering.

12:29.836 --> 12:31.939
And then she died.

12:33.573 --> 12:35.842
What about her puppies?

12:35.943 --> 12:38.078
Stillborn.

12:38.145 --> 12:41.148
If only she had been spayed.

12:41.214 --> 12:44.251
- Poor Croissant.
- Yeah.

12:44.317 --> 12:46.253
What happened to Muhammad?

12:46.319 --> 12:49.189
- Oh, Remi.
- What?

12:49.256 --> 12:52.792
Well, it went on raping...

12:52.859 --> 12:54.494
raping.

12:54.561 --> 12:58.798
Supposedly even squirrels
were victimized.

12:58.865 --> 13:01.434
Until one day, it was shot dead.

13:01.501 --> 13:06.039
They say it was skinned
and turned into a purse.

13:06.106 --> 13:08.475
Were the squirrels spayed?

13:11.278 --> 13:13.380
Oh.

13:36.003 --> 13:38.138
- Dina?!
- Coming.

13:38.205 --> 13:41.008
I'll get the car.
We're gonna be late.

13:45.178 --> 13:47.514
You sure you don't want
to come join us at yoga?

13:47.580 --> 13:49.116
Yeah.

13:49.182 --> 13:50.883
Would you rather we stay home?

13:51.018 --> 13:52.419
No, it's okay. You go.

13:52.485 --> 13:54.887
You need to do your body
maintenance.

13:55.022 --> 13:57.024
Oh, honey, are you sure?

13:57.057 --> 14:00.027
I just want to stay
with Wiener-Dog.

14:00.060 --> 14:01.861
I understand.

14:01.928 --> 14:04.264
Do you have enough granola bars?

14:04.331 --> 14:07.934
Okay.
We'll be back before lunch.

14:27.187 --> 14:29.189
They're gone!

15:52.239 --> 15:54.907
Wiener-Dog?

15:54.974 --> 15:56.743
What's the matter?

16:00.313 --> 16:02.315
Are you hungry?

16:07.187 --> 16:10.056
Want my granola bar, hmm?

16:12.192 --> 16:14.161
Okay.

16:50.297 --> 16:52.064
Oh, God.
Fuck.

16:52.199 --> 16:53.833
Oh!

16:53.900 --> 16:55.968
You see this?
No!

16:56.035 --> 16:58.305
No diarrhea!
No!

16:58.371 --> 17:00.907
Christ!

17:00.973 --> 17:03.210
What did you give her?!
What?!

17:03.276 --> 17:05.311
Some granola bars.

17:05.377 --> 17:07.914
Granola bars is not dog food.

17:07.980 --> 17:11.384
It's food for humans,
and dogs are not human!

17:11.451 --> 17:14.320
But I thought
granola was healthy.

17:14.387 --> 17:17.223
Granola is poison!
Christ, the dog can't digest!

17:17.257 --> 17:18.790
Oh, shit!

18:41.941 --> 18:45.211
Oh, shit!

20:32.318 --> 20:34.887
- Mom?
- Yes, honey?

20:34.954 --> 20:38.391
What's it like
to be put to sleep?

20:40.560 --> 20:45.565
It feels good.
Like forgetting everything.

20:45.632 --> 20:49.636
I'll never forget Wiener-Dog.

20:49.702 --> 20:51.303
Maybe when you're older.

20:51.438 --> 20:54.441
No.
Never.

20:55.675 --> 20:58.445
Did Dad watch her die?

20:58.511 --> 21:01.180
No.
They would never allow that.

21:01.247 --> 21:03.049
So she was alone.

21:03.115 --> 21:06.553
No, the vet was with her.

21:06.619 --> 21:09.221
Where do you think
they buried her?

21:09.288 --> 21:10.690
I don't know.

21:10.757 --> 21:13.460
Actually,
she was probably cremated.

21:13.493 --> 21:17.296
What's cremated?

21:17.363 --> 21:20.166
Sort of like put in an oven.

21:39.251 --> 21:41.253
Honey, death is a sad thing,

21:41.320 --> 21:43.723
but it's a natural thing.

21:43.790 --> 21:47.560
And sometimes it happens
without any reason at all.

21:51.163 --> 21:54.133
Well, what about God?

21:54.200 --> 21:55.735
We don't believe in God.

21:55.802 --> 21:59.772
Well, what do we believe in?

21:59.839 --> 22:04.677
Truth, compassion, love.

22:10.149 --> 22:12.084
We're all going to die.

22:15.855 --> 22:18.525
That's why we have each other.

22:18.558 --> 22:21.093
That's why we love each other.

22:26.298 --> 22:29.401
Then death is...

22:29.536 --> 22:31.137
a good thing?

22:54.694 --> 22:57.830
Yeah?
All right, hold on.

24:28.888 --> 24:30.857
Hey, Wiener dog.

24:33.025 --> 24:36.328
- Brandon McCarthy?
- How's it going?

24:38.665 --> 24:41.267
Wo... Wow!

24:41.333 --> 24:44.536
Yeah, wow.

24:44.671 --> 24:47.707
What are you doing here?

24:47.774 --> 24:49.676
Not much.
Passing through.

24:49.709 --> 24:51.678
Huh.

24:55.347 --> 24:57.149
You look pretty good.

24:57.216 --> 24:58.384
Thanks.

24:58.450 --> 25:00.252
You do, too.

25:03.522 --> 25:05.992
- Weird.
- Yeah, I know.

25:09.128 --> 25:12.431
I actually tried looking
you up on Facebook once.

25:12.498 --> 25:14.934
Oh, yeah?
Why?

25:15.001 --> 25:19.872
I don't know.
I was just surfing around and...

25:19.939 --> 25:23.209
I don't know. Your name.

25:23.275 --> 25:28.214
I mean, I've tried looking
up other people, too.

25:28.280 --> 25:29.415
Like who?

25:31.884 --> 25:33.619
Remember Ralphie?

25:33.720 --> 25:35.822
Who?

25:35.888 --> 25:38.124
He used to hang out with me
in, like, seventh grade.

25:38.190 --> 25:41.093
Oh, is he like gay pride
or something?

25:41.160 --> 25:42.729
Transgender.

25:43.595 --> 25:44.897
Huh.

25:46.232 --> 25:49.035
- You used to pick on him a lot.
- Really?

25:49.101 --> 25:52.104
- Yeah, like all the time.
- Hmm.

25:52.171 --> 25:53.973
You even beat him up once.

25:54.040 --> 25:57.376
You smashed his head
against the sidewalk.

25:57.443 --> 25:59.145
Remember?

25:59.211 --> 26:02.749
It's funny how none
of that shit sticks.

26:02.749 --> 26:04.751
Yeah.

26:07.553 --> 26:09.055
- Well, um...
- Maybe, uh...

26:09.121 --> 26:13.125
So, uh, do you want
to exchange e-mails or...

26:13.192 --> 26:17.563
I don't know, maybe catch up?

26:17.629 --> 26:19.999
We're kind of caught up now.

26:22.101 --> 26:23.502
Yeah.

26:23.569 --> 26:26.038
I'm sorry, but, like,
I'm really just passing through.

26:26.105 --> 26:28.074
That's okay.
Totally cool.

26:32.444 --> 26:34.380
Well, take care.

26:34.446 --> 26:35.982
Take care!

26:46.058 --> 26:50.262
Hey. There you go.
There you go.

26:50.329 --> 26:52.598
Good.
Yeah.

26:52.664 --> 26:55.902
Hey there, little meaner.

26:55.968 --> 26:59.638
Her name is Doo Dee.

26:59.705 --> 27:03.042
You mean, like, shit?

27:05.812 --> 27:08.314
I got her a week or so ago.

27:08.380 --> 27:12.584
She was sick,
but now she's much better.

27:12.651 --> 27:14.053
She likes you.

27:14.120 --> 27:16.222
Yeah, dogs like me.

27:18.390 --> 27:20.392
She looks like you.

27:20.459 --> 27:23.662
Thanks.

27:23.729 --> 27:25.832
I'm going to Ohio tomorrow.

27:25.865 --> 27:29.468
I leave early.

27:29.535 --> 27:31.303
You want to come along?

27:34.340 --> 27:36.642
What's in Ohio?

27:36.708 --> 27:38.377
Crystal meth.

27:41.447 --> 27:44.583
Okay.

27:44.650 --> 27:46.853
- Joke.
- Yeah.

27:46.919 --> 27:48.955
I-I-I know.

27:59.165 --> 28:01.300

No.
We prefer Mexico.

31:27.106 --> 31:29.708
But isn't it very dangerous
there now?

31:29.775 --> 31:32.611
I mean, with the drug violence?

31:32.678 --> 31:36.182
Yes, but not so lonely.

31:36.248 --> 31:39.451
In America, so lonely.

31:39.518 --> 31:41.187
And sad.

31:41.253 --> 31:43.122
And depressing.

Hey, look, April!

35:44.330 --> 35:46.398

These hot dogs are really good.

We have them every night
for supper.

- With hot dog rolls!
- Mmm!

36:03.582 --> 36:06.251
Can I give her a hot dog?

36:06.352 --> 36:07.653
Wiener dogs love hot dogs.

36:07.719 --> 36:10.522
Well, she has kind
of a sensitive stomach.

36:10.589 --> 36:12.624

Would you like to go for a walk?

37:14.420 --> 37:17.723
What for?

37:17.789 --> 37:21.560
I just thought it would be nice
if we could talk.

37:21.627 --> 37:23.929
Yeah.
I like talking.

kind of...

37:37.576 --> 37:40.446
girls only, you know?

37:40.479 --> 37:42.814
'Cause I wanted
us to get the chance

37:42.881 --> 37:47.152
to bond and talk about things.

37:47.218 --> 37:49.655
Tommy, Brandon.

37:49.721 --> 37:53.659
The way sometimes he just
doesn't get me, you know?

37:53.725 --> 37:58.464
And then his elusiveness
and intractability.

37:58.464 --> 38:00.165
Relationships.

38:02.868 --> 38:04.235
Oh.

38:04.302 --> 38:06.972
Why are you stopping, April?

38:07.038 --> 38:09.140
Can we go back inside?

38:09.207 --> 38:11.176
Oh, already?

38:11.242 --> 38:12.511
I want to go home.

38:12.578 --> 38:15.481
Did I say something wrong?

38:22.488 --> 38:25.090
Heads up, bitch.

38:25.156 --> 38:26.692
I win, I win, I win!

38:26.758 --> 38:29.260
Yeah! Let's play again!

38:29.327 --> 38:30.696
Uh, okay.

38:30.762 --> 38:33.231
Okay, but let's take
a little break first.

38:33.298 --> 38:35.266
How long?

38:35.333 --> 38:38.269
- 10 minutes.
- Five minutes.

38:38.336 --> 38:39.905
Okay, five minutes.

38:39.971 --> 38:42.307
- Five minutes.
- Five minutes.

38:42.373 --> 38:45.877
- And then we play again.
- And then we'll play again.

38:45.944 --> 38:47.513
Five minutes.

38:50.716 --> 38:52.884
Uh, come on,
let's go outside.

38:52.951 --> 38:54.820
Okay.

39:09.400 --> 39:11.202
Tommy?

39:15.273 --> 39:17.976
Yeah?

39:18.043 --> 39:20.445
You know how Dad
had a drinking problem?

39:20.546 --> 39:22.447
Yeah. But he worked
real hard.

39:22.548 --> 39:25.551
Now he doesn't drink anymore.

39:25.551 --> 39:27.653
But then he started
drinking again.

39:29.555 --> 39:32.157
- He did?
- Yeah.

39:32.223 --> 39:34.560
But he told me he stopped.

39:34.560 --> 39:35.894
He stopped...

39:35.961 --> 39:37.896
and then he started again.

39:40.331 --> 39:42.267
Why?

39:42.333 --> 39:44.770
He couldn't help himself.

39:44.836 --> 39:46.938
But he told me he stopped.

39:50.041 --> 39:52.243
The drinking made Dad
very sick.

39:52.310 --> 39:53.812
I know.

39:53.879 --> 39:55.747
That's why he stopped.

39:59.017 --> 40:01.219
He died, Tommy.

40:01.286 --> 40:03.922
But...

40:03.989 --> 40:07.859
I spoke to him last week.

40:07.926 --> 40:11.597
He spoke to you,
and then he died.

40:19.938 --> 40:22.808
Why?

40:22.874 --> 40:25.844
He drank too much.

40:25.911 --> 40:28.079
But he told me he stopped.

40:28.146 --> 40:29.414
He did.

40:29.480 --> 40:31.449
And then he started again,

40:31.516 --> 40:33.852
and he got sick and died.

40:33.919 --> 40:36.154
But he told me he stopped.

40:38.523 --> 40:41.459
I went looking
for Dad's family.

40:41.526 --> 40:44.996
Tracked them down.
I thought we were his family.

40:45.063 --> 40:47.899
He has a brother and a sister.

40:47.966 --> 40:50.135
But we're his family.

40:53.639 --> 40:54.906
You're right, we're his family.

40:54.973 --> 40:57.142
He has no brother and sister.

41:00.411 --> 41:02.480
You're right, they were just...

41:02.547 --> 41:03.682
names.

41:03.749 --> 41:06.752
He had no brother and sister.

41:06.818 --> 41:08.787
You're right.

41:14.660 --> 41:17.095
So...

41:17.162 --> 41:18.964
he died?

41:36.447 --> 41:38.984
Did you stop doing drugs?

41:41.152 --> 41:43.454
Yes.

41:43.521 --> 41:46.224
- Promise?
- Yes.

41:46.291 --> 41:48.293
And you won't start
doing them again.

41:50.962 --> 41:52.297
No.

41:52.363 --> 41:55.100
Promise?

41:55.166 --> 41:57.502
Yes.

41:57.568 --> 41:59.137
No more drugs?

42:01.406 --> 42:02.708
No more drugs.

42:02.708 --> 42:04.776

See, at first, I really

46:09.054 --> 46:11.556
and the Green Lantern
together in a movie.

46:11.622 --> 46:13.258
It's never been done.

46:13.324 --> 46:15.793
Yeah, it's too complicated
and expensive with the rights.

46:15.860 --> 46:18.829
Marvel is extremely guarded
about its trademarks.

46:18.964 --> 46:20.565
So, instead,
I thought I'd come up

46:20.631 --> 46:22.833
with my own
original superheroes,

46:22.968 --> 46:24.435
get the copyrighted,
and go to work.

46:24.502 --> 46:26.972
I mean, has a film student
ever done that for a short film?

46:27.038 --> 46:29.640
I don't think so.
And then...

46:29.707 --> 46:32.010
I could create original
villains, as well.

46:32.077 --> 46:33.979
For instance, there's...

46:34.045 --> 46:36.047
There's Sticky Fingers.

46:36.114 --> 46:37.682
I really like that name.

46:37.748 --> 46:41.319
And, remember, this is all
extremely confidential, please.

46:41.386 --> 46:43.521
So Sticky Fingers has this power

46:43.588 --> 46:45.723
where anything he touches sticks
to his fingers.

46:45.790 --> 46:47.225
It makes it really easy

46:47.292 --> 46:49.027
for him to rob people
without their realizing it.

46:49.094 --> 46:52.163
Like there's a special type
of gum

46:52.230 --> 46:53.431
at the end of each finger

46:53.498 --> 46:56.234
that can pick up
money or merchandise.

46:56.301 --> 46:58.503
Anyway, the police force
is at wit's end,

46:58.569 --> 46:59.804
the mayor of the city.

46:59.870 --> 47:02.707
Sticky Fingers is on the front
page of every paper.

47:02.773 --> 47:04.642
But then um, uh...

47:04.709 --> 47:06.077
Well,
this is where I have trouble.

47:06.144 --> 47:07.578
I mean, where do I go from here?

47:07.645 --> 47:09.247
I know how you're always
saying about the story,

47:09.314 --> 47:11.016
"what if," "then what?"

47:11.049 --> 47:13.584
But that's what I don't know
the answer to.

47:13.651 --> 47:16.754
What do you think
Sticky Fingers should do?

47:26.064 --> 47:29.200
- Hey, Professor Schmerz.
- Have a great weekend!

47:53.058 --> 47:54.659
Trey Silver's office.

47:54.725 --> 47:57.462
Hi. This is Dave Schmerz.

47:57.528 --> 48:00.398
I was just wondering
if you had any idea

48:00.465 --> 48:04.069
of when Trey might get around
to looking at the screenplay

48:04.135 --> 48:06.071
I sent back in November.

48:06.137 --> 48:08.139
It was a new draft.

48:08.206 --> 48:10.108
Oh, Dave, I'm so sorry.

48:10.175 --> 48:12.543
Did...
Did Trey not get back to you?

48:12.610 --> 48:14.079
No, not yet.

48:14.112 --> 48:16.914
I sent him a bunch of e-mails,
but I haven't had any reply.

48:16.981 --> 48:19.717
Well, he's been, like, crazy
busy these last few weeks.

48:19.784 --> 48:22.553
The whole agency's doing
this radical reshuffle.

48:22.620 --> 48:25.190
Oh, wait, I think he's just
wrapping up his FaceTime.

48:25.256 --> 48:27.592
Let me see
if I can pull some magic.

48:29.427 --> 48:31.196
Oh. It looks like he just

48:31.262 --> 48:32.863
hopped on another
conference call.

48:32.930 --> 48:35.900
What's the best number
I can have him reach you at?

48:35.966 --> 48:38.269
- My cell will be fine.
- Great.

48:38.336 --> 48:40.105
Then I'll let him know
you called as soon

48:40.105 --> 48:41.806
as he gets off.

48:41.872 --> 48:43.674
Thanks.

48:52.983 --> 48:55.120
Bear with me.

48:55.120 --> 48:58.289
Okay, then.

48:58.356 --> 49:01.126
So...
how are you doing?

49:01.126 --> 49:03.928
Great.
Great!

49:03.994 --> 49:05.963
Great.

49:06.030 --> 49:07.965
Would you like something
to drink?

49:08.032 --> 49:09.967
- Bottled water?
- Oh, thanks.

49:10.034 --> 49:12.137
Thanks, I'm good.

49:12.170 --> 49:13.704
Good.

49:13.771 --> 49:15.206
So, tell us...

49:15.273 --> 49:17.242
why do you want
to be a filmmaker?

49:17.308 --> 49:20.245
Well, I've just always
wanted to be a filmmaker.

49:20.311 --> 49:24.682
Ever since, really,
my whole life.

49:24.749 --> 49:26.617
Well, that's great.

49:26.684 --> 49:29.187
Yes, but... why?

49:29.254 --> 49:32.923
Well, I just feel I have
so much to say.

49:32.990 --> 49:34.292
Like what?

49:34.359 --> 49:35.960
What do you have to say?

49:36.026 --> 49:37.695
Well, just everything.

49:37.762 --> 49:41.499
I mean, movies have always
been so inspiring to me.

49:41.566 --> 49:45.170
But tell me,
what movies have inspired you?

49:45.170 --> 49:47.438
What movie or movies

49:47.505 --> 49:49.907
made you want
to become a filmmaker?

49:49.974 --> 49:51.276
Oh, gee.

49:51.342 --> 49:53.278
Well, really,
there are just so many.

49:53.344 --> 49:54.879
I mean, you name it.

49:54.945 --> 49:57.382
Like, all... all kinds.

49:57.448 --> 50:00.251
- Name one, for example.
- Oh, God.

50:00.318 --> 50:02.320
That is such a good question.

50:02.387 --> 50:03.888
And, I mean,
it's really hard, you know,

50:03.954 --> 50:06.591
because there are so many
that are just so great.

50:08.459 --> 50:11.095
What movies have you seen
in the past few weeks

50:11.162 --> 50:12.597
or months?

50:12.663 --> 50:16.267
Have you liked
any of them in particular?

50:16.334 --> 50:19.670
The past few weeks?

50:19.737 --> 50:21.739
Hmm.

50:21.806 --> 50:24.342
Any movie
that you saw over the last year

50:24.409 --> 50:26.877
and that you really liked.

50:26.944 --> 50:29.514
Or made an impression.

50:33.384 --> 50:36.221
Yeah, I know this is
like a trick question, you know,

50:36.287 --> 50:37.688
but there really are so many

50:37.755 --> 50:39.824
that I... I just
can't keep track.

50:39.890 --> 50:42.860
Please, just name a movie.

50:42.927 --> 50:44.929
Any movie.

50:47.265 --> 50:49.300
Excuse me.

50:49.367 --> 50:51.202
I have to take this.

51:01.946 --> 51:03.648
Hello, Schmerz here.

51:03.714 --> 51:06.584
I've got Trey Silver for you.

51:06.651 --> 51:09.086
- How you doing?
- Great!

51:09.153 --> 51:10.455
Great.

51:10.521 --> 51:12.457
Listen, I have big news.

51:12.523 --> 51:14.124
It's gonna sound
like bad news at first,

51:14.259 --> 51:17.762
but I promise you
it's good news in the end.

51:17.828 --> 51:18.996
Uh-huh.

51:19.063 --> 51:20.598
I'm leaving the agency,

51:20.665 --> 51:22.533
and I'm moving over
to Universal

51:22.600 --> 51:23.901
to be VP of production.

51:23.968 --> 51:26.003
I feel super sad
about leaving you,

51:26.070 --> 51:28.939
but it's gonna be so much
better for you in the end

51:29.006 --> 51:30.775
because I'll be in
a much stronger position

51:30.841 --> 51:32.743
to help move
your projects forward.

51:32.810 --> 51:34.679
Have you gotten
to read my script yet?

51:34.745 --> 51:37.047
No, but I wanted
to be totally focused

51:37.114 --> 51:40.050
on where I was first instead
of giving it a sloppy read

51:40.117 --> 51:42.453
while I'm in the middle
of a major job switch

51:42.520 --> 51:44.355
and the phone
is ringing off the hook

51:44.422 --> 51:46.757
and I've got, like,
5,000 e-mails

51:46.824 --> 51:49.627
and Variety...
Yada, yada, yada.

51:49.694 --> 51:51.929
So when do you think
you'll get around to reading it?

51:51.996 --> 51:55.165
First, I want to hand you
over to Carol Steinhardt.

51:55.300 --> 51:58.369
She's super excited about
taking over as your agent,

51:58.436 --> 52:00.805
provided you feel
cool about that.

52:00.871 --> 52:03.173
She's hot,
she's young, she's smart...

52:03.308 --> 52:04.375
Straight out of Harvard.

52:04.442 --> 52:06.311
She's a major up-and-comer.

52:06.311 --> 52:07.945
You're gonna totally click.

52:08.012 --> 52:09.780
So Carol's gonna read it first?

52:09.847 --> 52:13.651
Right now
I think that's your best move.

52:13.718 --> 52:16.621
Speaking off the record
as your friend.

52:16.687 --> 52:18.188
I'm gonna tell her
to give you a call

52:18.323 --> 52:19.657
as soon as we hang up.

52:19.724 --> 52:21.392
Er, wait.
Kara?

52:21.459 --> 52:22.993
I'm here, yes.

52:23.060 --> 52:25.630
See if you can get
Carol Steinhardt right now.

52:25.696 --> 52:26.997
Oh, okay.

52:27.064 --> 52:28.366
Really this is the best thing

52:28.433 --> 52:29.734
that could ever
have happened to you.

52:29.800 --> 52:31.602
I'm, like, so happy for you.

52:31.669 --> 52:33.638
- She's on a conference call.
- Oh, okay, listen.

52:33.704 --> 52:35.205
It's all gonna work out great.

52:35.340 --> 52:36.674
Promise.
Now I got to run.

52:36.741 --> 52:39.344
But I'll talk to you soon,
my friend.

52:47.352 --> 52:48.953
You need to exercise.

52:53.358 --> 52:54.925
I walk my dog.

52:57.094 --> 52:59.063
Exercise.

53:04.869 --> 53:06.671
I can't.

53:08.506 --> 53:11.376
Work out.

53:11.376 --> 53:13.378
Lose weight.

53:25.790 --> 53:29.394
I can't.

53:29.394 --> 53:31.729
You're a ticking time bomb.

54:14.338 --> 54:15.773
Hello?

54:15.840 --> 54:18.676
- Hi, is this Dave Schmerz?
- Yes.

54:18.743 --> 54:20.911
Please hold. I have
Carol Steinhardt for you.

54:20.978 --> 54:23.781
So nice to connect
with you at last, Dave.

54:23.848 --> 54:25.883
Things have been, like,
so crazy here at the agency.

54:25.950 --> 54:28.352
But, tell me,
how are you doing?

54:28.453 --> 54:30.220
Well, I don't have cancer.

54:30.287 --> 54:33.157
Oh, gee!

54:33.223 --> 54:34.559
Trey warned me about you.

54:34.625 --> 54:37.462
- So how are things going?
- Oh, my God.

54:37.528 --> 54:39.229
You can't...
Okay, well, listen now.

54:39.296 --> 54:40.798
Are you sitting down?

54:40.865 --> 54:42.266
Yeah.

54:42.332 --> 54:47.137
I slipped a copy of your
script over to DreamWorks.

54:47.204 --> 54:48.606
Oh.

54:48.673 --> 54:50.775
So when do you think
they'll read it by?

54:50.841 --> 54:53.010
I should know by Monday.
I mean, really,

54:53.077 --> 54:55.646
they are desperate
for new material.

54:55.713 --> 54:58.248
- Uh, did you read it?
- Dave, are you kidding me?

54:58.315 --> 55:00.250
Oh, my God, it's genius!

55:00.317 --> 55:01.552
Hilarious!

55:01.619 --> 55:02.920
I'm telling you, the script

55:02.987 --> 55:05.490
is going to be
a game changer for you.

55:05.523 --> 55:06.924
Oh, gee!

55:06.991 --> 55:08.993
Because I was really worried
about the third act

55:09.059 --> 55:11.629
where DooBee disguises himself
as his mother-in-law

55:11.696 --> 55:13.564
and the Mafia chases him
and then suddenly...

55:13.631 --> 55:15.032
List...
Oh, listen, Dave, honey,

55:15.099 --> 55:16.934
that's DreamWorks
on the other line.

55:17.001 --> 55:19.737
I'm gonna have to jump
onto that. Talk soon!

55:23.808 --> 55:25.175
Hey.

55:25.242 --> 55:27.311
Dave.

55:27.377 --> 55:29.079
Thanks for dropping by.

55:29.146 --> 55:31.381
I got a message you wanted me
to come talk with you.

55:31.516 --> 55:32.850
Come sit down.

55:32.917 --> 55:36.587
Don't worry,
it's really nothing so serious.

55:36.654 --> 55:38.422
Can I get you something
to drink?

55:38.523 --> 55:40.858
Coffee?
No, I'm good.

55:40.925 --> 55:42.827
Good.

55:42.893 --> 55:44.061
So...

55:44.128 --> 55:46.430
how are things
going with your screenplay?

55:46.531 --> 55:48.533
Things are happening.

55:49.534 --> 55:51.135
Good.

55:51.201 --> 55:52.169
Good!

55:54.639 --> 55:56.006
Oh, I'm sorry

55:56.073 --> 55:59.009
that I had to drop
out of that interview

55:59.076 --> 56:00.444
last week, the student.

56:00.545 --> 56:02.547
Nah.
I understood.

56:02.613 --> 56:04.682
Totally cool.

56:04.749 --> 56:06.383
Things are happening.

56:06.450 --> 56:08.352
I get it.

56:08.418 --> 56:12.022
Listen... we have a surprise
director

56:12.089 --> 56:13.991
coming this evening
for the Director Series,

56:14.058 --> 56:17.562
and I know you're not required
to show up for these things,

56:17.562 --> 56:20.230
but I'd really like it
if you did,

56:20.297 --> 56:21.899
as a favor.

56:21.966 --> 56:25.235
I really need a good turnout.

56:25.302 --> 56:27.605
Oh, I can show up.

56:27.672 --> 56:30.074
That's what you want?

56:30.140 --> 56:31.241
Fill a seat?

56:33.143 --> 56:35.079
Thanks, Dave.

56:40.450 --> 56:43.253
Is that all?

56:43.320 --> 56:45.089
Actually...

56:45.155 --> 56:46.924
there is something else.

56:46.991 --> 56:49.894
I've gotten a few reports,

56:49.960 --> 56:53.898
e-mails from some faculty,
some students.

56:53.964 --> 56:56.100
Who?

56:56.166 --> 56:58.669
They're not happy
with your performance here.

57:00.738 --> 57:01.906
What did I do wrong?

57:01.972 --> 57:04.208
You didn't do anything wrong.

57:04.274 --> 57:05.843
It's just...

57:05.910 --> 57:08.646
the general consensus is...

57:08.713 --> 57:11.616
you're a little too negative.

57:11.682 --> 57:13.450
General consensus?

57:13.517 --> 57:15.219
Well,
not everyone's complaining.

57:15.285 --> 57:16.453
It's...

57:16.520 --> 57:19.624
just there are always a few...

57:19.657 --> 57:21.058
complainers.

57:21.125 --> 57:23.260
So they're being negative
about me?

57:23.327 --> 57:26.931
Look, Dave, I'm talking
to you as your friend.

57:26.997 --> 57:29.834
I know you're a great
teacher here.

57:29.900 --> 57:32.369
I helped push
to keep you full time.

57:32.436 --> 57:35.372
"Celebrity Schmelebrity"
is a terrific script.

57:35.439 --> 57:36.841
It's a piece of shit.

57:42.379 --> 57:44.682
I tried to do something good.

57:46.784 --> 57:49.119
It's... something...

57:57.662 --> 58:01.331
Get into my childhood.

58:01.398 --> 58:04.534
Get into some...

58:04.669 --> 58:06.837
Something real.

58:11.441 --> 58:14.544
Real stuff.

58:14.679 --> 58:16.380
Pain.

58:20.150 --> 58:21.886
Memories.

58:27.024 --> 58:28.693
Dreams.

58:31.696 --> 58:33.931
But I wanted it to be funny.

58:37.835 --> 58:39.737
I wanted people to like it.

58:41.706 --> 58:43.708
I wanted it to sell.

58:53.483 --> 58:58.522
So I threw in
the mixed-up identities...

58:58.588 --> 59:03.360
I threw in the sex jokes.

59:03.427 --> 59:05.796
The Mafia.

59:10.835 --> 59:12.737
A little schtick.

59:16.473 --> 59:18.743
Everyone loves a little schtick.

59:23.781 --> 59:26.083
You're not tenured.

59:26.150 --> 59:27.818
This is a new administration.

59:27.885 --> 59:29.887
Shapiro's out.

59:29.954 --> 59:32.089
Brenner's gone.
Wienstein's gone.

59:32.156 --> 59:34.391
Horrowitz and Mandell, gone.

59:34.458 --> 59:35.993
There's only so much

59:36.060 --> 59:38.863
I can do if you don't put forth
a more positive attitude.

59:38.929 --> 59:42.099
Show people
that you really care.

59:47.805 --> 59:49.774
Show people.

59:56.080 --> 59:59.349
Thank you, thank you.

59:59.416 --> 01:00:02.787
Thank you.
Oh.

01:00:02.853 --> 01:00:04.554
The students and faculty

01:00:04.621 --> 01:00:08.158
are all so delighted
to have you with us today.

01:00:08.225 --> 01:00:09.960
As an alumnus,

01:00:10.027 --> 01:00:12.596
you serve
as a real-life inspiration.

01:00:12.662 --> 01:00:14.965
You've shown how it is,
in fact,

01:00:15.032 --> 01:00:19.236
possible to achieve success
after film school.

01:00:19.303 --> 01:00:20.337
Yes.

01:00:20.404 --> 01:00:23.373
But really
all I did was make a movie.

01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:26.543
One movie.
Luck is such a big factor.

01:00:26.610 --> 01:00:29.479
Yes, but talent doesn't hurt.

01:00:29.546 --> 01:00:32.682
- Well...
- Tell me,

01:00:32.749 --> 01:00:36.353
how do you feel about
your film school experience?

01:00:36.420 --> 01:00:37.521
I mean,

01:00:37.587 --> 01:00:40.357
how did it prepare you
for the real world?

01:00:40.424 --> 01:00:43.427
Nothing can prepare you
for the real world.

01:00:43.493 --> 01:00:46.931
Yes,
but what would you advise

01:00:46.997 --> 01:00:50.634
the students here
today who want to make movies,

01:00:50.700 --> 01:00:52.469
be like you?

01:00:52.536 --> 01:00:53.838
My advice?

01:00:53.904 --> 01:00:55.072
Drop out.

01:00:55.139 --> 01:00:57.842
Drop out and make a movie.

01:00:57.875 --> 01:01:00.544
You learn by doing.

01:01:00.610 --> 01:01:02.847
Class time is a waste.

01:01:02.913 --> 01:01:04.181
But, really,

01:01:04.248 --> 01:01:06.917
are you saying
you learned nothing here?

01:01:06.984 --> 01:01:09.753
Maybe some storytelling
techniques,

01:01:09.854 --> 01:01:11.688
screenwriting approaches?

01:01:11.755 --> 01:01:14.224
What if? Then what?

01:01:20.764 --> 01:01:23.100
I mean, no offense, but...

01:01:24.334 --> 01:01:25.302
Shit.

01:01:25.369 --> 01:01:27.771
Is Schmerz
still teaching here?

01:01:48.625 --> 01:01:51.595
You have reached
the office of Carol Steinhardt.

01:01:51.661 --> 01:01:53.898
Our office hours are Monday
through Friday,

01:01:53.931 --> 01:01:55.799
9:00 AM to 6:00 PM.

01:01:55.900 --> 01:01:59.303
Please leave a message telling
us your name, phone number,

01:01:59.369 --> 01:02:02.372
and purpose for calling
at the sound of the beep.

01:02:02.439 --> 01:02:03.707
Thank you.

01:02:06.610 --> 01:02:08.678
Carol...

01:02:08.745 --> 01:02:10.547
it's Dave Schmerz.

01:02:16.954 --> 01:02:19.223
I love you.

01:03:33.063 --> 01:03:36.400
Go on, I'm listening.

01:03:36.466 --> 01:03:38.902
Well, the thing is
I just don't understand

01:03:39.003 --> 01:03:40.870
why I can't write
a script about identity.

01:03:41.005 --> 01:03:42.439
What about identity?

01:03:42.506 --> 01:03:44.441
I mean, identity
in terms of gender.

01:03:44.508 --> 01:03:46.076
Its fluidity.

01:03:46.143 --> 01:03:47.911
I've been wanting
to apply '90s queer theory

01:03:48.012 --> 01:03:49.379
from a race perspective,
as well,

01:03:49.446 --> 01:03:51.581
but after reading
"Epistemology of the Closet,"

01:03:51.648 --> 01:03:53.017
I'm just not sure

01:03:53.083 --> 01:03:56.286
how to go about the problem
of cohesion and structure.

01:04:03.060 --> 01:04:04.794
Look...

01:04:04.861 --> 01:04:07.031
you know what I'm gonna say.

01:04:07.097 --> 01:04:10.100
You got to have a "what if."

01:04:10.167 --> 01:04:12.236
Simple as that.

01:04:12.302 --> 01:04:15.139
What if you got locked
out of your house?

01:04:15.205 --> 01:04:17.041
What if your girlfriend
cheated on you?

01:04:17.107 --> 01:04:19.043
What if you won the lottery?

01:04:19.109 --> 01:04:22.346
Then you would have a story.

01:04:22.412 --> 01:04:27.051
Then you would be in business.

01:04:27.084 --> 01:04:29.419
- I don't know.
- I know.

01:04:32.322 --> 01:04:35.225
Thanks for your time,
Professor Schmerz.

01:04:59.083 --> 01:05:01.085
Hey, Zeno...

01:05:01.118 --> 01:05:03.587
how'd it go with Schmerz?

01:05:03.653 --> 01:05:06.556
I'm dropping out.

01:05:06.623 --> 01:05:08.925
What did he say?

01:05:08.992 --> 01:05:10.260
What if.

01:05:10.327 --> 01:05:12.562
Fuck that shit.
I mean, like,

01:05:12.629 --> 01:05:14.964
what if you taught
script writing at a film school

01:05:15.099 --> 01:05:16.600
and had no fucking talent?

01:05:16.666 --> 01:05:19.269
What if you wrote,
like, one movie 19 years ago

01:05:19.336 --> 01:05:20.604
and it was a piece of shit?

01:05:20.670 --> 01:05:22.939
What if you had
incurable halitosis?

01:05:23.006 --> 01:05:24.608
At least he's got an agent.

01:05:24.674 --> 01:05:26.643
Big fuck.
My ex-boyfriend's an agent.

01:05:26.710 --> 01:05:28.712
The school
should get rid of him.

01:05:28.778 --> 01:05:32.616
It's just somehow everything
he suggests seems totally lame.

01:05:33.683 --> 01:05:35.452
Like, it's all shtick.

01:05:35.519 --> 01:05:36.753
He's probably got, like,

01:05:36.820 --> 01:05:39.123
the box set
to "Curb Your Enthusiasm."

01:05:39.189 --> 01:05:41.358
- Or "Seinfeld."
- Or Woody Allen.

01:05:41.425 --> 01:05:43.493
He's such a homophobe.

01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:45.162
He's an idiot,
and he's old.

01:05:45.229 --> 01:05:47.197
He's a dinosaur.

01:05:58.808 --> 01:06:01.178
Look, I read your script.
It's good.

01:06:01.245 --> 01:06:04.214
It's transgressive.

01:06:04.281 --> 01:06:06.616
- Thanks.
- I want to start a petition.

01:06:06.683 --> 01:06:08.352
I already talked to Phillips
about it...

01:06:08.418 --> 01:06:10.220
My uncle's on the board.

01:06:10.287 --> 01:06:11.955
I'm just,
like, done with this shit.

01:06:12.021 --> 01:06:13.657
He's so out of here.

01:06:13.723 --> 01:06:16.693
- Yeah, but, like, what if...
- What if what?

01:06:25.802 --> 01:06:28.772
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on!

01:07:49.118 --> 01:07:51.255
I.D.?

01:08:18.147 --> 01:08:20.450
Are you David Schmerz?

01:08:23.287 --> 01:08:25.322
What if I am?

01:08:26.990 --> 01:08:28.457
Then what?

01:09:02.225 --> 01:09:05.094
You did what?

01:09:05.161 --> 01:09:06.496
Cheese!

01:09:33.357 --> 01:09:35.124
Hi, Nana, it's Zoe.

01:09:35.191 --> 01:09:37.926
Um, listen, I'm just
running a little bit late,

01:09:37.993 --> 01:09:40.697
but I should definitely
be there in, like, in 20...

01:09:40.764 --> 01:09:42.631
20, 30 minutes tops, okay?

01:09:42.698 --> 01:09:45.368
And I'll...
I'll see you soon, okay?

01:09:45.435 --> 01:09:47.404
Okay, I love you.

01:10:09.393 --> 01:10:11.728
This way. This way.

01:10:15.131 --> 01:10:17.200
Yvette! Hi!

01:10:17.266 --> 01:10:20.670
Hi.

01:10:20.737 --> 01:10:22.872
Nana!
I'm sorry I'm late.

01:10:22.939 --> 01:10:26.676
Just the traffic
and now with that new highway...

01:10:26.743 --> 01:10:28.912
Hi.

01:10:28.978 --> 01:10:31.681
Oh, let me introduce you.
This is Fantasy.

01:10:31.748 --> 01:10:32.882
Hey.

01:10:32.949 --> 01:10:34.784
That's his actual name.
He's, um...

01:10:34.851 --> 01:10:37.220
He's got a sister called Dream.

01:10:37.286 --> 01:10:40.089
So...

01:10:40.156 --> 01:10:41.925
Yvette!

01:10:49.265 --> 01:10:51.067
Kaopectate.

01:11:04.047 --> 01:11:05.849
You look really good.

01:11:05.915 --> 01:11:07.884
Huh?

01:11:07.951 --> 01:11:09.986
I said you're
looking really good.

01:11:10.053 --> 01:11:11.488
I heard you.

01:11:13.557 --> 01:11:16.460
Fantasy is an artist.

01:11:16.493 --> 01:11:17.694
Like Picasso.

01:11:17.761 --> 01:11:19.463
He was just in this group show,

01:11:19.529 --> 01:11:21.998
and it got mentioned in
"Artforum" 30 Under 30.

01:11:22.065 --> 01:11:26.903
And he was a finalist
for a Guggenheim last year.

01:11:26.970 --> 01:11:28.538
Oh, I got robbed.

01:11:28.605 --> 01:11:30.139
You know,
Nana used to do some painting

01:11:30.206 --> 01:11:31.808
when she was young.
Didn't you, Nana?

01:11:31.875 --> 01:11:35.512
I posed nude
and spread my legs.

01:11:36.546 --> 01:11:38.047
That's cool.

01:11:39.483 --> 01:11:41.350
Yeah, Fantasy is actually, um,

01:11:41.485 --> 01:11:43.853
he's involved
in installation work.

01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:46.923
Not... Not type specific,
but more like mixed media.

01:11:46.990 --> 01:11:49.993
And, um, he actually
finds these dead animals,

01:11:50.059 --> 01:11:51.394
and he embalms them,

01:11:51.495 --> 01:11:52.996
and then he sort of
roboticizes them

01:11:53.062 --> 01:11:56.132
into these, like,
audio sculptural sort of...

01:11:56.199 --> 01:11:59.368
- I'm interested in mortality.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:11:59.503 --> 01:12:00.804
I mean his work is...

01:12:00.870 --> 01:12:03.039
very exploratory,
very controversial.

01:12:03.106 --> 01:12:04.841
And you might be thinking
that it's sort of

01:12:04.908 --> 01:12:06.710
like a Damien Hirst derivative,
but it's...

01:12:06.776 --> 01:12:09.378
Fuck that derivative shit!

01:12:11.180 --> 01:12:13.182
But it... But it...
But his work is...

01:12:13.249 --> 01:12:16.720
Motherfuckers.

01:12:16.786 --> 01:12:20.023
His work is actually
very, um...

01:12:20.089 --> 01:12:24.528
you know, social welfare,
income gap, inequality oriented.

01:12:24.528 --> 01:12:26.229
Fuck Damien Hirst!

01:13:09.939 --> 01:13:13.577
Thanks.

01:13:23.787 --> 01:13:26.623
I think it's really great
that you got a new dog,

01:13:26.690 --> 01:13:28.124
and it's so cute!

01:13:28.191 --> 01:13:31.460
I mean, I think that everyone
should have a pet.

01:13:31.595 --> 01:13:33.496
What's its name?

01:13:33.597 --> 01:13:35.599
Cancer.

01:13:38.868 --> 01:13:42.038
Wait, wait, um...
Why would...

01:13:42.105 --> 01:13:44.207
you name it that?

01:13:44.273 --> 01:13:46.610
It felt right.

01:13:46.610 --> 01:13:49.445
Wait...

01:13:49.512 --> 01:13:51.180
Nana, are y... are you?

01:13:51.247 --> 01:13:53.382
Everyone's dying.

01:13:53.449 --> 01:13:55.018
- I'm going outside.
- Here.

01:13:55.084 --> 01:13:58.187
Take Cancer with you.
She has to go.

01:14:11.901 --> 01:14:14.638
Um, there's all of
this traffic now,

01:14:14.638 --> 01:14:16.640
and it used to be so quiet here

01:14:16.673 --> 01:14:18.174
and peaceful and...

01:14:18.241 --> 01:14:20.777
sound of bird calls.

01:14:27.516 --> 01:14:29.986
Do you ever think about moving?

01:14:30.053 --> 01:14:31.454
No.

01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:33.222
But the highway...

01:14:38.194 --> 01:14:39.663
Oh, um...

01:14:39.663 --> 01:14:42.065
I got you a little present.

01:14:44.133 --> 01:14:46.569
What for?

01:14:46.670 --> 01:14:49.305
I just thought, you know...

01:14:49.372 --> 01:14:51.374
crazy, spur of the moment.

01:14:54.678 --> 01:14:56.112
Here, open it.

01:14:56.179 --> 01:14:59.115
You open it.

01:14:59.182 --> 01:15:00.984
Yeah, okay.

01:15:04.153 --> 01:15:05.588
It's, um...

01:15:05.689 --> 01:15:07.691
It's an ostrich egg.

01:15:10.126 --> 01:15:11.394
It's... It's...

01:15:11.460 --> 01:15:14.397
It's supposed to be
like a delicacy in South Africa.

01:15:14.463 --> 01:15:19.035
People worship it there,
and you can fry it or poach it

01:15:19.102 --> 01:15:22.972
or scramble it or,
you know, pickle it or...

01:15:23.039 --> 01:15:24.007
Yvette?

01:15:40.757 --> 01:15:42.625
Just be super careful
with it, Yvette.

01:15:42.726 --> 01:15:44.493
It's just really delicate.

01:16:09.986 --> 01:16:12.455
I got a part in a movie.

01:16:12.521 --> 01:16:13.757
It's a speaking part.

01:16:13.757 --> 01:16:16.993
Um, I play...

01:16:17.060 --> 01:16:19.896
a crack whore,
but it's very emotional,

01:16:19.963 --> 01:16:21.430
super tender.

01:16:21.497 --> 01:16:23.266
Very tender.

01:16:23.332 --> 01:16:25.268
And it's two scenes.

01:16:32.675 --> 01:16:36.212
Nana, I know that I haven't been
to visit you in a while.

01:16:36.279 --> 01:16:39.182
When was the last time
you came by?

01:16:39.248 --> 01:16:42.518
I don't know.

01:16:42.585 --> 01:16:44.353
Three years.

01:16:46.689 --> 01:16:49.959
Four.

01:16:50.026 --> 01:16:52.228
How much do you need this time?

01:16:56.565 --> 01:16:58.334
10,000.

01:17:00.804 --> 01:17:02.972
But it's not 'cause of drugs.

01:17:03.039 --> 01:17:05.174
It's just this could be such
a big deal for Fantasy.

01:17:05.241 --> 01:17:08.711
You know, in this moment
of his career and he's...

01:17:08.812 --> 01:17:11.614
You know, he's worked so hard
and he's so sensitive inside.

01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:13.917
And it's...
It's for a really,

01:17:13.983 --> 01:17:16.052
really good cause.

01:17:46.615 --> 01:17:49.252
How's your dad?

01:17:49.318 --> 01:17:50.920
He's in...

01:17:50.987 --> 01:17:53.556
California, I think.

01:17:55.859 --> 01:17:59.328
When was the last time
you saw him?

01:17:59.395 --> 01:18:00.997
We don't speak.

01:18:04.333 --> 01:18:08.071
- When are you getting married?
- I don't know.

01:18:08.137 --> 01:18:10.039
Um...
You know,

01:18:10.106 --> 01:18:13.742
there's just so much stuff
going on right now, and...

01:18:13.877 --> 01:18:16.012
Fantasy and I are kind
of just taking things easy,

01:18:16.079 --> 01:18:18.547
you know,
'cause there's no rush, like...

01:18:18.614 --> 01:18:20.516
I mean, I'm still young, so...

01:18:20.583 --> 01:18:22.251
Don't kid yourself.

01:18:27.623 --> 01:18:28.992
Um, you just...

01:18:29.058 --> 01:18:31.594
You just forgot to fill out
the amount.

01:18:31.660 --> 01:18:32.962
No, you fill it out.

01:18:33.029 --> 01:18:35.131
I'm no good with numbers.

01:18:45.942 --> 01:18:47.911
I'm worried that...

01:18:51.447 --> 01:18:55.952
I'm worried that Fantasy
isn't faithful to me.

01:19:06.362 --> 01:19:09.132
Yo, Zoe!

01:19:09.198 --> 01:19:11.634
That's him.
I got to go.

01:19:17.006 --> 01:19:19.008
Bye, Nana!
We'll be back soon.

01:19:19.075 --> 01:19:21.277
Thank you!

01:20:16.732 --> 01:20:19.068
What happened to you?

01:20:20.836 --> 01:20:22.571
I got old.

01:20:22.638 --> 01:20:26.242
- I don't want to be old.
- Don't worry.

01:20:26.309 --> 01:20:29.512
It will happen so fast,
you won't even know it happened.

01:20:32.048 --> 01:20:35.985
Do I have to get wrinkles?

01:20:36.052 --> 01:20:37.886
They're not so bad.

01:20:37.953 --> 01:20:40.923
Yes, they are.

01:20:40.990 --> 01:20:42.992
Well, you can always
have work done.

01:20:43.059 --> 01:20:46.629
You mean Botox?

01:20:51.767 --> 01:20:53.502
Who are all these children?

01:20:53.569 --> 01:20:55.104
You.

01:20:55.171 --> 01:20:57.206
They're all you.

01:20:57.273 --> 01:20:59.375
All the different lives
you could have had

01:20:59.442 --> 01:21:02.078
if you hadn't chosen
the life you chose.

01:21:02.145 --> 01:21:03.779
But I didn't choose.

01:21:03.846 --> 01:21:08.151
That's you if you had
continued studying art.

01:21:08.217 --> 01:21:12.488
And that's you if you had
married your true love.

01:21:12.555 --> 01:21:16.392
And that's you
if you had forgiven your mother.

01:21:16.459 --> 01:21:20.963
So many years
you never got to know.

01:21:21.064 --> 01:21:23.866
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:21:23.932 --> 01:21:26.502
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:21:26.569 --> 01:21:27.736
And that's you

01:21:27.803 --> 01:21:30.139
if you'd shown kindness
to your daughter.

01:21:30.206 --> 01:21:31.707
And that's you

01:21:31.774 --> 01:21:35.144
if you'd learned
to overlook others' flaws.

01:21:35.211 --> 01:21:39.648
And you if you hadn't
given up on life.

01:21:39.715 --> 01:21:40.849
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:21:40.916 --> 01:21:44.853
- Hello.
- Hello. Hello.

01:21:44.920 --> 01:21:48.591
And here's you if you'd ever
liked other people.

01:21:48.657 --> 01:21:52.295
And you
if you'd ever liked yourself.

01:21:52.361 --> 01:21:55.498
You if you left bigger tips.

01:21:55.564 --> 01:21:57.800
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:21:57.866 --> 01:21:59.535
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:21:59.602 --> 01:22:03.172
And now it's time
to say good-bye.

01:22:03.239 --> 01:22:05.608
- No.
- But you have to.

01:22:05.674 --> 01:22:08.544
- You have to.
- You have to.

01:22:08.611 --> 01:22:09.978
No!

01:22:10.113 --> 01:22:13.916
- Everything has a beginning.
- And everything has an end.

01:22:13.982 --> 01:22:17.120
No! No!

01:22:17.153 --> 01:22:19.488
No! N...

01:22:34.437 --> 01:22:36.605
Cancer?

01:22:37.940 --> 01:22:39.408
Cancer?

01:22:47.183 --> 01:22:48.517
Cancer?

01:22:52.521 --> 01:22:53.856
