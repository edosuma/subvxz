00:56.633 --> 00:57.700
Oh!

00:58.400 --> 01:01.200
Rose, you nearly scared me to death.
What are you doing?

01:01.266 --> 01:02.800
Getting a close-up of your face.

01:03.300 --> 01:06.667
Maybe I'm too close.
Have you been eating poppy seeds?

01:07.734 --> 01:10.834
Put that thing down.
What are you doing?

01:10.900 --> 01:14.166
I'm making a video
for my junior college class.

01:14.233 --> 01:17.233
Oh, really? Gee, it sounds like fun.

01:17.300 --> 01:22.700
-I want you to be one of the stars.
-I don't think so.

01:22.767 --> 01:25.400
I'm uncomfortable in front of a camera.

01:25.467 --> 01:28.667
I always come out
looking like Fess Parker.

01:30.233 --> 01:33.700
This is a documentary.
It's ok if you're not good-looking.

01:35.934 --> 01:38.467
Rose, stop trying to appeal to my ego.

01:38.834 --> 01:40.066
The answer is no.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.333
Sophia, would you like to star
in my video?

01:45.400 --> 01:47.266
Are there any
nude love scenes involved?

01:48.834 --> 01:49.834
No!

01:49.900 --> 01:52.600
If it's integral to the plot, I'll do it.

01:53.600 --> 01:57.400
Dorothy, Sophia wants to be in my video.
Why won't you?

01:57.467 --> 01:59.200
Dorothy's camera shy.

01:59.767 --> 02:02.166
You'd be, too, if you looked like
Fess Parker in heels.

02:05.400 --> 02:09.367
Oh, Blanche, how do you feel about
performing in front of a video camera?

02:13.000 --> 02:16.233
I think it's ok if you've already had
at least three dates.

02:19.200 --> 02:21.066
It's for my video class.

02:21.133 --> 02:24.767
My final project is
<i>a day in the life of my roommates.</i>

02:24.834 --> 02:26.900
Sure, honey. Sounds like fun.

02:26.967 --> 02:30.967
Thank you, Blanche. You're a real friend.
You and Sophia.

02:31.533 --> 02:35.667
-I'll shoot around Dorothy.
-All right, Rose. I'll do it.

02:35.734 --> 02:38.066
Just don't shoot from too low.

02:38.433 --> 02:40.800
Stan did that in our home movies.

02:40.867 --> 02:43.200
I always looked like someone
from another planet.

02:44.100 --> 02:47.000
She looked like Fess Parker
from another planet.

02:48.500 --> 02:53.867
I got an invitation to my college sorority
reunion. The alpha gams.

02:54.667 --> 02:57.066
I belonged to a sorority
when I was in college.

02:57.133 --> 02:58.533
The alpha yams.

03:00.600 --> 03:02.266
It was an agricultural college.

03:04.133 --> 03:09.533
I cannot wait to see my sorority sisters,
Scarlett, Melanie, and the other girls.

03:10.000 --> 03:14.700
It'll be exactly like old times.
Well, maybe not just exactly.

03:14.767 --> 03:18.333
The other girls will have
grown wrinkled and saggy,

03:18.400 --> 03:21.533
while I have remained
unbelievably devastating.

03:22.934 --> 03:25.800
I cannot wait to rub their noses in it.

03:26.533 --> 03:30.133
You make lifelong bonds
when you join a sorority.

03:30.200 --> 03:33.000
I never belonged to a sorority.
I was blackballed.

03:33.066 --> 03:36.233
Oh, that is so cruel.

03:36.300 --> 03:38.467
The alpha yams didn't have blackballing.

03:38.533 --> 03:42.133
We believed any girl who wanted
to help her community

03:42.200 --> 03:46.700
-should be allowed to join.
-That's very commendable.

03:46.767 --> 03:48.734
As long as she could castrate a sheep.

03:54.633 --> 03:58.567
There was a service organization in Sicily
with similar membership requirements.

03:59.433 --> 04:00.967
Except instead of a sheep,

04:01.033 --> 04:03.767
it usually involved the mayor
from a neighboring town.

04:05.667 --> 04:09.600
-Ma!
-Some of Italy's finest sopranos

04:09.667 --> 04:10.834
were former mayors.

04:20.600 --> 04:21.700
Hi, Rose.

04:21.767 --> 04:24.433
Dorothy, you're supposed
to pretend I'm not here.

04:24.500 --> 04:25.900
I'm sorry, Rose.

04:25.967 --> 04:29.467
Ever since you filmed me naked
giving myself a pedicure,

04:29.533 --> 04:32.033
I've become slightly aware
of your presence.

04:33.533 --> 04:36.367
Dorothy, my child,
sunshine of my life.

04:36.433 --> 04:37.600
Mmm, mmm.

04:37.667 --> 04:39.400
You got that on a close-up,
Rose?

04:40.633 --> 04:44.633
Ma, why are you dressed like someone who
just escaped from "it's a small world"?

04:45.700 --> 04:47.033
Come, my darling daughter.

04:47.100 --> 04:49.433
Mother has made you
your favorite breakfast.

04:49.734 --> 04:52.033
Lasagna in meat sauce?

04:52.100 --> 04:54.433
Mmm. Doesn't it look delicious?

04:54.767 --> 04:58.734
And think, for just 5.95
the recipe can be yours.

05:01.467 --> 05:04.467
Hold it. Stop! Stop the camera. Cut!

05:04.533 --> 05:08.000
The director's the only one
who can say when to cut.

05:08.500 --> 05:11.300
Unless the actor is big and mad.

05:12.667 --> 05:16.533
-Ma, what is going on?
-Dorothy, this could be my big chance.

05:16.600 --> 05:19.133
With the exposure I get
from Rose's movie...

05:19.200 --> 05:21.200
I could hawk my recipes
all over the country.

05:21.266 --> 05:22.800
Oh, that's ridiculous.

05:23.100 --> 05:27.133
Oh, no. If you wanna move your product,
you gotta have exposure.

05:27.200 --> 05:29.066
All the great Italian chefs had it.

05:29.467 --> 05:33.200
Mama Celeste, chef Boyardee
and chef Balducci.

05:34.800 --> 05:36.467
I don't remember chef Balducci.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.934
Oh, right.
He didn't have television exposure.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.467
That was indecent exposure.

05:43.333 --> 05:45.967
He should've stuffed the cannelloni
in the traditional manner.

05:53.266 --> 05:54.266
Hi, girls.

05:54.900 --> 06:00.133
What are you doing here?
The reunion isn't over till tomorrow.

06:00.200 --> 06:04.867
-I decided I'd come home a day early.
-Is there something wrong?

06:04.934 --> 06:07.133
No. Nothing.

06:13.300 --> 06:14.600
Whatever gave you that idea?

06:14.667 --> 06:16.667
If there's nothing wrong...

06:17.133 --> 06:21.266
should we defrost a pork loin
so you could scoop up the sauce?

06:22.834 --> 06:25.300
I can't help it. I'm so upset.

06:25.667 --> 06:27.967
Seeing my sorority sisters
was just dreadful.

06:28.033 --> 06:29.400
What happened?

06:30.033 --> 06:32.700
It was as if time had stood still
for 30 years.

06:32.767 --> 06:36.367
They looked wonderful.
They had hardly aged at all.

06:36.433 --> 06:38.500
I saw a movie like that once.

06:40.233 --> 06:43.867
All the women were sucked
into flying saucers.

06:43.934 --> 06:46.934
Mechanical doubles were sent to earth
to replace them.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.100
Did any of them mention
a leader named Zardoz?

06:53.467 --> 06:58.100
They had all had facelifts,
and they looked absolutely gorgeous.

06:58.166 --> 07:01.233
It was the most disgusting spectacle
I've ever witnessed.

07:02.266 --> 07:05.934
Are you saying you're upset
because the reunion went great

07:06.000 --> 07:08.066
and your sorority sisters
looked wonderful?

07:08.133 --> 07:10.867
Of course not. That would be childish.

07:10.934 --> 07:13.200
I'm upset because I wasn't the center
of attention

07:13.266 --> 07:15.033
and nobody said I was the prettiest.

07:17.100 --> 07:22.700
-What difference does it make?
-Oh, Dorothy.

07:22.767 --> 07:26.767
You cannot possibly begin to comprehend
the terrible trauma

07:26.834 --> 07:30.767
a gorgeous woman goes through
when her beauty starts to fade.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.500
Who do you see
when you look at me, Joe Pepitone?

07:37.367 --> 07:41.000
My beauty has always outshone
every other woman's.

07:41.066 --> 07:42.133
But no more.

07:42.433 --> 07:45.834
Now people are cuter than me.
My life is over.

07:45.900 --> 07:50.867
-Blanche, you can get a facelifts, too.
-I can't do that.

07:50.934 --> 07:53.567
Surgery scares me to death.

07:53.633 --> 07:57.567
Then you'll just have to grow old
along with us.

07:57.633 --> 08:00.367
I couldn't go on
if I had to look like you two.

08:04.233 --> 08:08.400
You know, she had me in her corner
right up until the end.

08:20.767 --> 08:22.100
Hi, ma, you want some tea?

08:22.433 --> 08:24.767
Nah, I'm trying to cut back.
Tea stains my dentures.

08:24.834 --> 08:26.834
Last night I had to soak them in Ajax.

08:29.166 --> 08:32.300
They're white, but my mouth feels like
somebody should rinse their socks in it.

08:33.166 --> 08:36.000
-Want a glass of milk?
-Nah, it upsets my stomach.

08:36.066 --> 08:38.033
-Orange juice?
-Ah, too acidic.

08:38.100 --> 08:41.100
-Is there anything I can get you?
-A cup of tea would be nice.

08:43.266 --> 08:47.834
The rough cut of my documentary is done.
Where's Blanche?

08:47.900 --> 08:50.100
Where she's been for two days...

08:50.567 --> 08:52.367
locked in her room crying.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.233
I can't believe she's still upset

08:55.300 --> 08:57.700
because her classmates
look better than she does.

08:57.767 --> 09:02.433
I can. Her looks have always been
very important to Blanche.

09:02.500 --> 09:06.166
Blanche is very vain.
Vanity can be terrible.

09:06.233 --> 09:11.000
-I used to be vain myself.
-You, Sophia?

09:11.066 --> 09:14.266
You think I was born with white hair
and a butt like Play-Doh?

09:18.934 --> 09:21.266
When I was a teenager,
I was gorgeous.

09:21.633 --> 09:24.300
Eyes as deep and black as ripe olives.

09:24.367 --> 09:27.667
Skin as smooth and
creamy as fresh butter.

09:28.300 --> 09:31.600
Hair, flaming red,
like a rich marinara sauce.

09:31.667 --> 09:34.333
Ma, that's not you.
That's your lasagna recipe.

09:36.266 --> 09:37.266
Aw, shut up.

09:38.633 --> 09:41.700
I was the most gorgeous girl
in the village.

09:41.767 --> 09:45.166
I had my pick of the town's most eligible
goat farmers...

09:47.200 --> 09:51.667
until Anna Maria Alonzo Palladino,
known to her friends as muffin...

09:52.166 --> 09:53.433
moved to our village.

09:53.967 --> 09:57.300
Suddenly, all the men...
who were always fighting over

09:57.367 --> 10:01.467
who would keep the footprints
I left in the mud, were after muffin.

10:02.333 --> 10:05.667
-So, I decided--
-Just a minute.

10:06.233 --> 10:10.867
They would fight over who kept
the footprints you left in the mud?

10:10.934 --> 10:15.066
It was a poor village. What did you want
them to collect, Faberge eggs?

10:19.266 --> 10:23.800
Anyway, I was too vain to be the second
most beautiful girl in the village...

10:24.100 --> 10:27.834
so I told muffin how I felt.

10:28.467 --> 10:34.166
That's when I found out that beautiful
girl was even more beautiful inside.

10:34.633 --> 10:37.066
She offered to move
to the neighboring village.

10:37.133 --> 10:39.800
And you felt guilty
because you'd been vain.

10:39.867 --> 10:41.667
Hell, no! I helped her pack!

10:44.767 --> 10:46.867
But it all backfired in my face.

10:46.934 --> 10:50.066
The next day,
all the good-looking men followed her.

10:51.600 --> 10:53.533
That's how I ended up with your father.

10:55.834 --> 10:58.400
Boy, talk about
learning a lesson the hard way.

11:00.333 --> 11:02.333
-Hi, girls.
-Blanche, how you feeling?

11:02.400 --> 11:06.600
Much better.
I've decided I've been acting foolish.

11:06.667 --> 11:11.500
-I guess I still look pretty good.
-Pretty good? You look terrific.

11:11.567 --> 11:12.633
I know.

11:12.967 --> 11:17.767
I'm also trying to be more modest,
but that's like lying, which is worse.

11:18.066 --> 11:19.734
You're right. I do look terrific.

11:20.266 --> 11:25.333
Thank goodness that's over with.
I want your opinion on my movie.

11:25.400 --> 11:27.133
It's in the living room.

11:27.433 --> 11:30.967
There's no soundtrack,
but the editing's done.

11:31.467 --> 11:36.667
This would be better with a bigger TV,
and it would be better with music.

11:36.734 --> 11:37.800
It would be better--

11:37.867 --> 11:40.667
It would be better with Shelley Hack.
Turn it on!

11:41.533 --> 11:42.533
Here goes.

11:45.767 --> 11:47.700
That's Sophia walking into the kitchen.

11:48.200 --> 11:50.333
I didn't know
Fess Parker was in this picture.

11:52.700 --> 11:54.967
-Ma! What are you doing?
-Mugging for the camera.

11:55.033 --> 11:57.900
You're mugging me.
You're stealing money from my pocket.

11:58.200 --> 12:00.667
I'm checking for bus change.

12:01.166 --> 12:02.300
Now I'm stealing.

12:03.934 --> 12:06.100
My God! Is that me? I look awful.

12:06.166 --> 12:09.433
-I was out of focus.
-You're always out of focus.

12:09.500 --> 12:13.633
I look old. I look decrepit.
I look ancient!

12:13.700 --> 12:16.133
I'm wrinkled like a prune!

12:16.200 --> 12:18.867
Could be worse.
She could look like Fess Parker.

12:18.934 --> 12:24.467
-Turn that thing off!
-Blanche, calm down.

12:24.533 --> 12:28.000
Oh, I'm just as calm as can be.
And you know why?

12:28.066 --> 12:32.433
My worst suspicions have been confirmed.
My good looks are fading.

12:32.500 --> 12:34.133
The camera does not lie.

12:34.700 --> 12:36.633
That leaves me with only one choice.

12:37.100 --> 12:40.266
I'm going to be perfect.
I'm going to be gorgeous!

12:40.600 --> 12:44.867
I'll have my tummy tucked,
my butt firmed, my breasts raised,

12:44.934 --> 12:46.333
and my face lifted.

12:49.033 --> 12:51.166
It's a shame to do all that
and keep that hairdo.

13:05.400 --> 13:08.200
Rose, what do you think
of Cheryl Tiegs' nose?

13:08.867 --> 13:11.800
Oh, very nice. Kind of small.

13:12.533 --> 13:14.867
Grandpa Nylund always said,
"The air is free.

13:14.934 --> 13:18.133
You might as well have a big honker
and suck up as much as you can."

13:20.100 --> 13:22.567
Course, grandpa looked
like he'd caught a boomerang

13:22.633 --> 13:23.633
in the middle of his face.

13:25.200 --> 13:28.033
-I think I'll get this nose.
-What are you getting?

13:28.500 --> 13:32.233
I'm picking out a face
to show the plastic surgeon tomorrow.

13:32.300 --> 13:36.767
I want to get Linda Evans' eyes,
Lena Horne's cheekbones,

13:36.834 --> 13:39.467
and Carol Burnett's chin.

13:39.533 --> 13:41.867
I think you can get that chin
through a catalog.

13:43.300 --> 13:48.233
If you put the pieces together,
you see the new me.

13:48.300 --> 13:49.300
What do you think?

13:49.967 --> 13:52.433
Why is everyone
looking at a picture of Gavin Macleod?

13:55.400 --> 13:59.467
No, Sophia honey, this is a collage
of the things I'm having done to my face.

13:59.533 --> 14:03.700
-You're going ahead with the surgery?
-I'm looking forward to it.

14:03.767 --> 14:07.000
I think plastic surgery is unnatural.

14:07.066 --> 14:10.433
This from a woman
who slept with a pig until she was 11.

14:12.500 --> 14:16.734
If looking better makes you feel better,
there's nothing wrong with it.

14:16.800 --> 14:21.500
-Looking good isn't that important to me.
-What are you talking about?

14:21.567 --> 14:25.367
You wear makeup.
You even color your hair.

14:25.867 --> 14:27.600
This is my hair's natural color.

14:29.900 --> 14:32.567
Yeah, and John Madden
is a finicky eater.

14:35.600 --> 14:40.734
Plastic surgery is so drastic.
I think I'd be too scared.

14:40.800 --> 14:45.100
Believe me, there's nothing to it.
It's not that bad.

14:45.166 --> 14:48.667
Dorothy, have you had plastic...
I don't believe it.

14:48.734 --> 14:51.767
-On what?
-My eyes. Worth every penny.

14:51.834 --> 14:55.333
You spent $1,500.
You go out on two dates a year.

14:56.700 --> 14:59.367
I didn't do it for anybody else.
I did it for me.

14:59.433 --> 15:03.500
Most people didn't know I'd had surgery,
but I knew.

15:03.567 --> 15:07.734
-It made me feel better about myself.
-You were lucky.

15:07.800 --> 15:09.900
It doesn't always work out that well.

15:10.200 --> 15:13.000
-It sure didn't for Olga Fetchick.
-Just a minute, Rose.

15:17.066 --> 15:19.066
Give me a hand signal
when she's finished.

15:21.700 --> 15:24.133
Olga Fetchick was our town beautician...

15:24.400 --> 15:28.066
and one of God's most unattractive
creations since the aardvark.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.133
Anyway, over the years...

15:32.433 --> 15:36.467
Olga had been secretly squirreling away
money for plastic surgery.

15:36.934 --> 15:40.867
One day she left without telling anyone,
had the surgery,

15:40.934 --> 15:43.100
and didn't return for months.

15:43.667 --> 15:45.934
Well, nobody could believe their eyes.

15:46.000 --> 15:49.300
Olga Fetchick had become
a stunning beauty.

15:49.367 --> 15:51.633
Every man in town wanted her.

15:51.700 --> 15:55.233
She ended up marrying St. Olaf's most
eligible bachelor,

15:55.300 --> 15:57.233
dance instructor Adolph Stepp.

16:00.066 --> 16:03.800
The two of them moved back to Norway,
decided to get into show business,

16:03.867 --> 16:08.533
and they became the renowned dance team
of Stepp and Fetchick.

16:29.834 --> 16:31.934
Rose, not that I care, but...

16:32.000 --> 16:33.934
since you've already gone
to so much trouble...

16:34.300 --> 16:37.433
how did having plastic surgery
ruin Olga's life?

16:37.500 --> 16:42.133
It didn't ruin her life.
It almost ruined St. Olaf.

16:42.767 --> 16:47.266
After she left, the town didn't have
a professional beautician for years.

16:48.667 --> 16:51.066
Women started giving
each other home perms.

16:51.467 --> 16:54.266
Pretty soon, everybody
looked like Art Garfunkel.

16:57.133 --> 17:01.934
Husbands stopped sleeping with their
wives. The population started to go down.

17:04.266 --> 17:06.200
The town would have gone under

17:06.266 --> 17:10.800
if Oslo's most famous hair stylist,
Vidal Sassbogodotter...

17:11.967 --> 17:17.467
hadn't relocated his shop in St. Olaf
because of our more favorable tax laws.

17:18.467 --> 17:21.633
Now, you see why I don't
like plastic surgery?

17:26.900 --> 17:31.433
-Ow! Why did you do that?
-Why should we be the only ones in pain?

17:36.166 --> 17:37.567
You were saying, Rose?

17:45.166 --> 17:49.333
-Mrs. Devereaux, come in. I'm Dr. Taylor.
-Pleased to meet you.

17:49.400 --> 17:51.333
I'd like to go over your form.

17:51.400 --> 17:55.233
Fine. Shall I disrobe here,
or do you have an examining room?

17:55.834 --> 17:59.633
I meant your medical form
that you filled out.

17:59.700 --> 18:00.967
Sorry.

18:01.033 --> 18:05.433
You are proposing some
very extensive surgery.

18:05.700 --> 18:10.233
-Eyes, nose, stomach--
-And breasts. I cut this out of magazine.

18:10.300 --> 18:13.700
-What do you think?
-Very nice.

18:15.333 --> 18:19.333
The angle's a little steep
for my personal taste...

18:19.867 --> 18:21.867
but they certainly do make a statement.

18:22.467 --> 18:23.967
Yes, they do. They say "big."

18:25.133 --> 18:26.600
That's exactly what I want.

18:26.667 --> 18:30.100
It so happens that breasts
are my specialty.

18:30.600 --> 18:34.266
You have that in common with a linebacker
I know on the Miami dolphins.

18:35.367 --> 18:39.600
As a matter of fact,
I've worked on several celebrities.

18:39.667 --> 18:43.333
-What celebrities have you done?
-I can't tell you that.

18:43.400 --> 18:44.600
That would be unethical.

18:44.667 --> 18:49.400
Let's just say that some of my handiwork
is prominently featured

18:49.467 --> 18:52.100
on NBC's Thursday night lineup.

18:53.867 --> 18:56.133
-Mrs. Devereaux--
-Call me Blanche.

18:56.200 --> 18:59.600
We're talking about tightening my behind
and pumping up my bosoms.

18:59.667 --> 19:02.200
We can be on a first name basis.

19:02.266 --> 19:04.133
All right, Blanche.

19:04.400 --> 19:06.533
But I think you don't
understand some things.

19:06.934 --> 19:10.066
There are a lot of good reasons
for having this work done,

19:10.133 --> 19:12.867
but there are also a lot of bad ones.

19:13.367 --> 19:16.433
Plastic surgery will
improve your appearance.

19:16.500 --> 19:21.500
It won't make you perfect.
And there are risks involved.

19:21.567 --> 19:25.200
There are absolutely no guarantees,
no miracles.

19:26.133 --> 19:29.300
You are not going to dissuade me
from having this surgery.

19:30.300 --> 19:32.834
You see, all my life,
my physical beauty

19:32.900 --> 19:37.367
has served as a source of inspiration
to me and to countless others.

19:37.867 --> 19:42.266
But now that beauty seems to be fading,
and I'm scared.

19:42.834 --> 19:45.700
I've never had to do without it.
And I don't know if I can.

19:46.633 --> 19:50.800
I don't mind growing older
as long as I always look the same.

19:51.767 --> 19:54.967
So there's no doubt about it.
I don't care about the risks.

19:55.033 --> 19:57.300
I definitely intend to have this surgery.

20:10.233 --> 20:15.000
Oh, Blanche, honey, how are you?

20:15.467 --> 20:18.734
-(mumbling)
-You're probably pretty uncomfortable,

20:18.800 --> 20:21.133
but in a few days,
you'll be feeling fine, Blanche.

20:21.200 --> 20:22.533
(mumbling)

20:22.600 --> 20:26.200
-Can we get you anything?
-(mumbling)

20:27.967 --> 20:29.500
Whoa.

20:34.767 --> 20:37.734
I think you got yourself
one hell of a lawsuit, Blanche.

20:40.934 --> 20:43.133
Was this a last-minute decision?

20:46.934 --> 20:48.600
We're very sorry, sir.

20:52.233 --> 20:53.233
Uh...

20:55.133 --> 20:58.333
Uh, nurse, do you know what
happened to Mrs. Devereaux?

20:58.400 --> 21:01.567
Mrs. Devereaux canceled her surgery.
She checked herself out this morning.

21:02.600 --> 21:05.467
I'm sorry for the inconvenience,
Mr. Diodoro.

21:05.533 --> 21:06.967
It's time for your medication.

21:07.500 --> 21:10.533
Diodoro?
Funny, he didn't look Italian.

21:22.433 --> 21:25.033
-She's not out there.
-She isn't in her bedroom.

21:25.100 --> 21:29.133
I think she was in the kitchen.
The coffee's still warm.

21:29.200 --> 21:32.700
We were there less than an hour ago.

21:32.767 --> 21:35.600
Excuse me, miss Marple.
I'm new at this.

21:38.967 --> 21:40.500
Blanche, where have you been?

21:40.567 --> 21:42.867
Why didn't you call us?
You had us worried.

21:42.934 --> 21:46.667
I thought I'd get home
before you left for the hospital.

21:46.734 --> 21:50.667
I would have, too,
if I hadn't seen this dress

21:50.734 --> 21:53.266
and realized instantly
how it would accentuate

21:53.333 --> 21:56.133
the soft, voluptuous curves
of my gorgeous body.

21:56.600 --> 21:58.000
Gorgeous body?

21:58.066 --> 22:01.333
Yesterday it was a bag
of russet potatoes with earrings.

22:02.533 --> 22:04.600
That depends on how you look at it.

22:04.934 --> 22:08.266
Dr. Gordon W. Taylor
looked at it with desire.

22:08.333 --> 22:11.667
Why else would he ask me out
for Friday night?

22:11.734 --> 22:18.600
-You canceled surgery for a date?
-It was a date with a plastic surgeon.

22:18.934 --> 22:20.367
Beauty is his stock in trade.

22:20.433 --> 22:22.867
He can create any face, body he wants.

22:23.133 --> 22:24.800
What he wanted was mine.

22:25.166 --> 22:26.567
That got me to thinking.

22:26.633 --> 22:31.700
All my life, I have had a unique charm
that kind of flowed naturally.

22:31.767 --> 22:35.500
If I tampered with that,
I could risk losing forever that...

22:35.567 --> 22:38.500
special magic
that is Blanche Devereaux.

22:39.166 --> 22:42.033
That was a risk I wasn't willing to take.

22:42.100 --> 22:44.700
That's why you decided
not to have the surgery.

22:44.767 --> 22:49.000
No. If I could land a doctor,
I'd wait and let him pay for it.

22:51.967 --> 22:54.433
Besides, I guess
I can live with the lines,

22:54.500 --> 22:56.166
the wrinkles, and the sagging...

22:56.667 --> 22:58.967
if I have the three of you
to grow old with.

22:59.033 --> 23:01.266
That's lovely.

23:01.333 --> 23:04.266
Especially since,
no matter how old we get,

23:04.333 --> 23:08.133
I'll always be the youngest, prettiest,
and by far the most desirable.

23:12.066 --> 23:15.400
You know, once again,
she had me in her corner

23:15.467 --> 23:17.066
right up until the end.

23:23.867 --> 23:29.033
(theme music playing)
