WEBVTT

00:06.339 --> 00:08.041
EVERY HELL SPAWN,

00:08.108 --> 00:10.777
ALL THE WAY BACK
TO THE PRIMORDIAL PAST,

00:10.844 --> 00:14.481
HAS LOST THEIR STRUGGLE
WITH THE DARKNESS.

00:14.547 --> 00:16.182
DON'T GIVE
INTO THE DEMONS.

00:16.249 --> 00:17.751
YOU HEAR ME,
SOLDIER ?

00:17.817 --> 00:20.687
DON'T LET
THE DEMONS
TAKE YOU.

00:20.754 --> 00:22.322
( Cogliostro )
WHEN YOU PULLED
THAT TRIGGER

00:22.389 --> 00:24.724
YOU MADE HELL
TAKE NOTICE.

00:24.791 --> 00:27.927
SPAWN WAS BORN
ON THAT DAY.

00:29.796 --> 00:31.164
( Spawn )
WE WERE PARTNERS.

00:31.231 --> 00:34.834
FROM THE DAY WE MET,
MY JOB WAS TO WHACK YOU.

00:34.901 --> 00:36.236
WHO GAVE
THE ORDER ?

00:36.302 --> 00:37.937
IT WAS WYNN !

00:39.973 --> 00:41.775
( rambling )
I KILLED HIM... !

00:41.841 --> 00:43.309
CONFESSIONS OF
A FRUITCAKE,

00:43.376 --> 00:44.544
PROBABLY NOTHING.

00:44.611 --> 00:46.646
CHECK THE ALLEYS FOR
ANOTHER BODY ANYWAY.

00:46.713 --> 00:47.981
DETECTIVES BURKE
AND WILLIAMS,

00:48.047 --> 00:50.517
I'M LISA WU,
WASHINGTON POST.

00:50.583 --> 00:52.051
YOU'RE INVESTIGATING
MURDERS COMMITTED

00:52.118 --> 00:53.686
IN THE ALLEYS
OFF 42nd STREET.

00:53.753 --> 00:54.921
NO COMMENT, LADY.

00:54.988 --> 00:57.290
HAVE YOU FOUND THE GUNS
USED IN THE MURDERS ?

00:57.357 --> 00:59.092
( Spawn )
GET AWAY FROM ME !

00:59.159 --> 01:02.028
( Cogliostro )
A HELL SPAWN CAN BE
FREE OF THE CURSE.

01:02.095 --> 01:03.530
HOW CAN YOU
KNOW THAT ?

01:03.596 --> 01:05.732
BECAUSE I AM FREE.

01:06.633 --> 01:10.503
Captions made possible by
HOME BOX OFFICE

01:10.570 --> 01:14.674
A DIVISION OF TIME WARNER
ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY, L.P.

01:51.077 --> 01:53.580
AHH !

02:05.024 --> 02:07.660
WE'VE ALL SEEN FACES
THAT MAKE US TURN OUR HEADS.

02:07.727 --> 02:10.296
PEOPLE WITH SCARS
OR BAD BURNS.

02:10.363 --> 02:13.333
WHAT IF IT WENT
WAY BEYOND THAT ?

02:13.399 --> 02:16.302
WHAT IF SOMEONE HAD A FACE
SO UGLY AND HIDEOUS

02:16.369 --> 02:20.240
THAT EVEN THEY COULDN'T
BEAR THE SIGHT OF THEMSELVES ?

02:21.774 --> 02:23.543
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED
TO AL SIMMONS,

02:23.610 --> 02:24.978
NOW TRAPPED
IN A BURNT BODY

02:25.044 --> 02:26.312
THAT'S NOT
EVEN HIS OWN.

02:26.379 --> 02:28.515
RETURNING FOR A LOVER
WHO'S NOW LOST.

02:28.581 --> 02:31.584
HE REMEMBERS THE WAY HIS
WIFE USED TO TOUCH HIM,

02:31.651 --> 02:33.953
CARESS HIS FACE,
KISS HIS LIPS.

02:38.925 --> 02:41.494
HE MIGHT AS WELL BE TRAPPED
IN A STONY TOMB.

02:41.561 --> 02:43.563
COLDNESS SEEPING
INTO THE BONES,

02:43.630 --> 02:45.498
ALL ALONE,

02:45.565 --> 02:47.800
SUFFOCATING IN
THE TOTAL DARKNESS.

03:00.747 --> 03:05.118
( Cogliostro )
HOW DOES ONE FIND
HUMANITY IN AN ALLEY ?

03:08.354 --> 03:11.124
HOW DOES ONE
REGAIN ONE'S SOUL

03:11.190 --> 03:13.993
IN AN ABANDONED CHURCH ?

03:17.030 --> 03:19.098
FOR THIS NEWEST
HELL SPAWN,

03:19.165 --> 03:22.068
THIS ALLEY IS
A WEIGH STATION,

03:22.135 --> 03:24.871
HIS SPECIAL
PURGATORY.

03:30.843 --> 03:33.980
( priest )
... IN SICKNESS
AND IN HEALTH,

03:34.047 --> 03:37.817
UNTIL DEATH
DO YOU PART.

03:45.592 --> 03:48.494
( Cogliostro )
HE LURKS HERE IN THE SHADOWS,

03:48.561 --> 03:52.298
AMID THIS
HUMAN DEBRIS,

03:52.365 --> 03:54.601
WAITING...

03:54.667 --> 03:58.304
JUST INSIDE
THE PORTAL FROM HELL.

04:08.247 --> 04:10.850
BUT THIS IS
NOT HIS DOMAIN.

04:10.917 --> 04:14.787
HIS DOMAIN IS
THAT BURNED SKIN.

04:14.854 --> 04:20.393
HIS SHELL OF NECROPLASM,
AND THE SCARLET SHROUD

04:20.460 --> 04:23.162
WHICH HOVERS
AROUND HIM,

04:23.229 --> 04:26.399
PROTECTING HIM
AND POSSESSING HIM,

04:26.466 --> 04:28.635
AT THE SAME TIME.

04:28.701 --> 04:31.537
( chatter )

04:33.373 --> 04:36.109
WHERE IS
THE OLD MAN ?

04:36.175 --> 04:38.311
WHY ISN'T
HE HERE ?

04:38.378 --> 04:40.480
I DON'T KNOW.

04:40.546 --> 04:42.949
HE'S A GHOST,
LIKE YOU.

04:43.016 --> 04:45.418
HE JUST APPEARS.

04:45.485 --> 04:49.222
AL, WHAT'S HAPPENING
TO YOUR FACE ?

04:51.057 --> 04:52.558
( evil laughter )

04:52.625 --> 04:54.560
HE'S LAUGHING AT ME !

04:54.627 --> 04:56.729
C'MON, IT'S OKAY,
MAN, IT'S OKAY.

04:56.796 --> 04:59.732
LOOK, IT'S JUST
THE CHURCH BELLS.

04:59.799 --> 05:02.702
C'MON, IT'S
SUNDAY MORNING.

05:02.769 --> 05:04.937
( bells chiming )

05:02.769 --> 05:04.937
STOP IT !

05:02.769 --> 05:04.937
( bells chiming )

05:02.769 --> 05:04.937
STOP IT !

05:08.341 --> 05:11.077
( Clown laughing )

05:35.034 --> 05:39.205
LEAVE ME ALONE !

05:46.679 --> 05:48.314
( evil laughter )

06:20.813 --> 06:24.517
I AM STILL ALIVE.

06:24.584 --> 06:28.755
DID YOU THINK YOU COULD
STRIKE A DEAL WITH
MALEBOLGIA ?

06:28.821 --> 06:31.157
AND THEN RENEGE ?

06:31.224 --> 06:33.893
THIS IS
A GRAVEYARD.

06:33.960 --> 06:35.661
I CAN FEEL
THE DEATH.

06:35.728 --> 06:38.397
YES, LOOK AROUND YOU.

06:38.464 --> 06:40.666
THESE ARTIFACTS
ARE ALL THAT REMAIN

06:40.733 --> 06:43.469
FROM HELL SPAWNS
OF THE PAST.

06:43.536 --> 06:46.305
THEY WERE
CURSED LIKE YOU.

06:46.372 --> 06:49.075
THIS IS
THEIR SHRINE.

06:49.142 --> 06:51.577
A REMINDER OF WHAT
MAY BE YOUR FATE.

06:54.247 --> 06:57.383
MAYBE YOU'RE NOT
A CRAZY OLD BUM.

07:00.853 --> 07:03.122
WHAT DO
THEY CALL YOU ?

07:03.189 --> 07:04.957
I HAVE HAD MANY NAMES.

07:05.024 --> 07:08.161
IN THIS TIME,
THEY CALL ME COGLIOSTRO.

07:08.227 --> 07:10.429
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN HIDING HERE ?

07:10.496 --> 07:11.597
HIDING ?

07:11.664 --> 07:15.635
I'VE BEEN HERE
FOR MANY YEARS.

07:15.701 --> 07:18.371
YOU SEE, I'M THE NIGHT
CURATOR OF ANTIQUITIES,

07:18.437 --> 07:21.541
THIS IS HOW I HAVE KEPT
THESE RELICS SAFE,

07:21.607 --> 07:23.609
WHILE I WAITED FOR YOU.

07:23.676 --> 07:24.944
WAITED ?

07:25.011 --> 07:27.079
IN EVERY AGE,
A HELL SPAWN IS SENT.

07:27.146 --> 07:29.348
I TRY TO
GUIDE THEM,

07:29.415 --> 07:31.651
AS I'VE TRIED
TO GUIDE YOU.

07:31.717 --> 07:33.686
BUT THEY ARE
LOST SOULS.

07:33.753 --> 07:35.288
I'M NOT THEM.

07:37.790 --> 07:39.959
THIS IS
YOUR TOMB.

07:40.026 --> 07:45.364
WHAT DEAL DID YOU
STRIKE WITH HIM ?

07:45.431 --> 07:48.334
IT WAS THE TIME
OF KNIGHTHOOD,

07:48.401 --> 07:50.837
A TIME OF THE MIST.

08:02.748 --> 08:04.717
AFTER THE
ENDLESS BATTLES

08:04.784 --> 08:06.719
AND THE SLAUGHTER
OF INNOCENTS,

08:06.786 --> 08:09.288
IT WAS I WHO WAS
SENT BY MALEBOLGIA

08:09.355 --> 08:12.091
TO COLLECT THE SOULS,

08:12.158 --> 08:15.094
AND RIDE WITH THEM
IN THE AIR NIGHT,

08:15.161 --> 08:17.496
THE RIDE
OF THE DEAD.

08:17.563 --> 08:19.665
BUT NEVER TO DIE,

08:19.732 --> 08:21.667
THERE WAS NO
HONOR IN THAT,

08:21.734 --> 08:23.469
NOT FOR A KNIGHT.

08:23.536 --> 08:26.772
MY HONOR HAD BEEN
TAKEN FROM ME.

08:26.839 --> 08:28.808
I TURNED AWAY
FROM KILLING,

08:28.875 --> 08:32.011
THE BLACK ARTS DREW ME.

08:32.078 --> 08:35.581
I STRUGGLED WITH
EVIL INSIDE

08:35.648 --> 08:38.417
AND USED SORCERY
TO FREE MYSELF.

08:38.484 --> 08:42.421
IN THAT TIME,
I WAS KNOWN AS MERLIN.

08:46.659 --> 08:48.861
IF YOU ARE
THE BLACK KNIGHT,

08:48.928 --> 08:50.496
THEN I WANT
ANSWERS.

08:50.563 --> 08:53.332
YOUR FLESH REBELS
AGAINST YOU.

08:53.399 --> 08:56.068
THE SHROUD
ATTACKS YOU.

08:56.135 --> 08:58.504
YOU WALLOW
IN SELF PITY.

08:58.571 --> 08:59.705
YOUR LOSS.

08:59.772 --> 09:01.641
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
ANYMORE TALK, OLD MAN !

09:01.707 --> 09:03.676
YOU CLAIM TO BE
SOME KIND OF WIZARD.

09:03.743 --> 09:06.279
SHOW ME WHAT THIS GODDAMN
SHROUD IS GOOD FOR !

09:06.345 --> 09:08.381
NO.

09:08.447 --> 09:10.616
YOU WILL,
OLD MAN.

09:10.683 --> 09:12.752
THIS IS NOT
THE ALLEY, HELL SPAWN.

09:12.818 --> 09:14.687
I MAKE THE RULES
IN THIS PLACE.

09:14.754 --> 09:17.056
YOU ARE IN MY DOMAIN.

09:17.123 --> 09:19.458
THEY MAY HAVE
TAKEN YOUR HONOR

09:19.525 --> 09:22.728
BUT THEY STOLE
MY LIFE.

09:22.795 --> 09:24.997
I CAME BACK
FOR WANDA.

09:25.064 --> 09:27.767
BUT SHE SEES ME
AS A MONSTER.

09:27.833 --> 09:30.336
DO YOU WISH TO
FIND THE ANSWERS ?

09:30.403 --> 09:32.571
WHAT ARE YOU
PREPARED TO DO ?

09:32.638 --> 09:34.674
I AM GOING TO GET
MY LIFE BACK.

09:34.740 --> 09:36.309
IF YOU WON'T HELP ME,

09:36.375 --> 09:39.145
I'LL FIND THE ANSWERS
SOMEWHERE ELSE.

09:42.214 --> 09:43.749
ONE OF YOUR OFFICERS
FOUND A REPORT

09:43.816 --> 09:45.551
ON A COP KILLED
IN THE ALLEYS.

09:45.618 --> 09:47.753
Jason, you're
a busy man.

09:47.820 --> 09:49.455
Why are you
spending your time

09:49.522 --> 09:52.425
reading our
New York City
police reports ?

09:52.491 --> 09:54.460
CHIEF BANKS,

09:54.527 --> 09:56.896
IF I DIDN'T FEEL YOU
SERVED A PURPOSE FOR ME,

09:56.963 --> 09:58.431
I WOULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN
YOU NOMINATED

09:58.497 --> 10:01.334
FOR POLICE COMMISSIONER
AND WE WOULDN'T BE HAVING

10:01.400 --> 10:03.536
this conversation,
would we ?

10:03.602 --> 10:05.538
MR. WYNN, I DIDN'T
MEAN TO IMPLY...

10:05.604 --> 10:07.640
THE REPORT WAS WRITTEN
BY AN OFFICER

10:07.707 --> 10:09.675
NAMED MAX WILLIAMS.

10:09.742 --> 10:12.178
Twitch, smart cop,
thorough.

10:12.244 --> 10:15.848
HIS PARTNER IS SAM BURKE,
A MEAT AND POTATOES GUY.

10:15.915 --> 10:18.184
YOUR SMART COP DESCRIBES
THE SHOOTING DEATH

10:18.250 --> 10:20.319
OF ONE OF
YOUR BEST OFFICERS,

10:20.386 --> 10:21.654
KILLED IN THE ALLEYS.

10:21.721 --> 10:23.823
The dying man's
last words on earth were,

10:23.889 --> 10:25.424
"red cloak".

10:25.491 --> 10:27.493
FIND THE MAN
IN THE RED CLOAK.

10:27.560 --> 10:29.895
DON'T MOVE IN ON HIM
UNTIL YOU CALL ME.

10:29.962 --> 10:32.531
Consider it done.

10:41.407 --> 10:42.975
THE DAMN THING'S NO GOOD,

10:43.042 --> 10:44.477
THE SIGHTS ARE
OFF OR SOMETHING.

10:44.543 --> 10:46.746
YES, SIR.

10:46.812 --> 10:48.848
WORTHLESS
PIECE OF SHIT.

10:48.914 --> 10:50.249
IT'S JAMMED.

10:50.316 --> 10:51.717
FORTUNATELY.

10:51.784 --> 10:53.652
I CAN USUALLY
SHOOT THE DICK

10:53.719 --> 10:55.221
OFF A SQUIRREL
FROM HERE.

10:55.287 --> 10:57.256
LOOK AT THIS JUNK,
STUPID GUN !

10:59.058 --> 11:02.294
( Twitch )
YOUR LACK OF AIM IS SURELY
THE GUN'S FAULT, SIR.

11:02.361 --> 11:03.562
LACK OF AIM, HUH ?

11:03.629 --> 11:05.264
WHAT, TWITCH, YOU THINK
YOU CAN DO BETTER ?

11:05.331 --> 11:06.465
YOU KNOW, TWITCH,

11:06.532 --> 11:08.000
YOU REALLY LOST
YOUR SENSE OF HUMOR.

11:08.067 --> 11:09.402
YOU'RE TOO SERIOUS.

11:09.468 --> 11:11.604
YOU GOTTA LEARN
TO LIGHTEN UP A LITTLE.

11:23.649 --> 11:25.418
( bells )

11:32.458 --> 11:34.160
LET'S JUST
SEE NOW.

11:37.963 --> 11:39.999
LUCKY SON-OF-A-BITCH.

11:40.066 --> 11:42.268
GIVE ME THAT GUN.

11:42.334 --> 11:45.337
BURKE, I THOUGHT
THEY WEREN'T GONNA

11:45.404 --> 11:46.739
LET YOU BACK
ON THE RANGE

11:46.806 --> 11:48.874
AFTER THAT
INCIDENT LAST WEEK.

11:48.941 --> 11:50.409
HEY, I'VE BEEN
CLEARED OF THAT ONE.

11:50.476 --> 11:52.144
IT WAS THE GUY'S FAULT,
HE SHOULD HAVE DUCKED.

11:52.211 --> 11:53.779
YOU'RE AT A
DISADVANTAGE, BURKE.

11:53.846 --> 11:56.715
YOUR GUT KEEPS YOU
TOO FAR FROM THE TARGET.

11:56.782 --> 11:57.883
HEY, TWITCH,

11:57.950 --> 11:59.785
I THINK THE CHIEF
JUST CRACKED A JOKE.

11:59.852 --> 12:01.420
ALRIGHT, THIS
IS YOUR REPORT

12:01.487 --> 12:03.689
ON ONE OF OURS THAT
WAS KILLED IN THE ALLEYS.

12:03.756 --> 12:05.825
WE CLOSED THAT CASE,
IT WAS OUR COLLAR.

12:05.891 --> 12:07.827
THAT COP WAS KILLED
BY A CRAZY PRIEST.

12:07.893 --> 12:09.328
BEFORE HE DIED,

12:09.395 --> 12:10.963
THAT COP SAID THERE
WERE TWO OF THEM.

12:11.030 --> 12:12.364
THAT LEADS ME
TO BELIEVE

12:12.431 --> 12:14.066
MAYBE THE PRIEST
HAD A PLAYMATE.

12:14.133 --> 12:16.936
HE ALSO SAID SOMETHING
ABOUT A RED CLOAK.

12:17.002 --> 12:18.604
I REMEMBER,

12:18.671 --> 12:21.774
THAT'S A DETAIL
I SHOULDN'T HAVE
MISSED, CHIEF.

12:21.841 --> 12:23.476
GET ME A PERP.

12:23.542 --> 12:24.743
I DON'T CARE
IF YOU GOTTA EAT,

12:24.810 --> 12:26.312
SLEEP AND BREATHE
THOSE ALLEYS.

12:26.378 --> 12:27.847
AND I DON'T CARE HOW
MUCH SHIT YOU STEP IN.

12:27.913 --> 12:30.816
YOU SHOULD FEEL
RIGHT AT HOME, BURKE.

12:30.883 --> 12:32.785
CHECK IT OUT.

12:32.852 --> 12:34.453
( male )
You're missing
the point, Lisa.

12:34.520 --> 12:36.122
I don't want you to have
a good time in New York,

12:36.188 --> 12:38.023
I want you to have
a lonely, exhausting trip,

12:38.090 --> 12:39.925
which indicates to me
that you're writing a story

12:39.992 --> 12:41.927
that will spill
a lot of ink.

12:41.994 --> 12:43.896
LET'S CUT
THE BULLSHIT.

12:43.963 --> 12:47.099
IF I WASN'T THE BEST...
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE SENT ME.

12:47.166 --> 12:49.201
You got a thing for
these psychos, Lisa.

12:49.268 --> 12:51.170
You always manage
to get close to them.

12:51.237 --> 12:53.973
YEAH, WELL MY JOB IS
TO HUNT THEM DOWN.

12:54.039 --> 12:56.742
THEY ALL GIVE OFF
THE SAME SCENT.

12:56.809 --> 12:58.711
What scent
is that ?

12:58.777 --> 12:59.778
EVIL.

12:59.845 --> 13:02.047
Hey, Lisa ?

13:02.114 --> 13:03.282
YEAH ?

13:03.349 --> 13:05.718
You're spooky.

13:05.784 --> 13:07.219
Now tell me
what you have.

13:07.286 --> 13:09.655
THIS GUY WEARS
A RED CLOAK.

13:09.722 --> 13:11.257
( man laughing )

13:11.323 --> 13:15.060
HEY, HE'S NO JOKE,
HE MURDERS PEOPLE.

13:15.127 --> 13:17.763
I'M GONNA FIND HIM.

13:17.830 --> 13:20.699
AND DELIVER TO YOU
HIS HEAD ON A PLATTER.

13:34.847 --> 13:37.483
( speaking foreign )

13:43.222 --> 13:44.657
( alarm buzzing )

13:55.534 --> 13:58.003
LIKE DOLL'S EYES.

14:01.974 --> 14:03.709
( Burke )
FOURTH TIME WITH
THIS ZOMBIE,

14:03.776 --> 14:05.110
AND WE DON'T HAVE SHIT.

14:05.177 --> 14:06.912
THE GUY HAS
NO PRINTS, NO NAME.

14:06.979 --> 14:09.515
AND AS SOON AS HE STARTS IN
ABOUT THE DEAD GUY'S BACK,

14:09.582 --> 14:11.083
I'M GONE.

14:11.150 --> 14:13.152
I CAN'T DO A FIFTH DANCE
WITH THIS TWISTED SISTER.

14:13.219 --> 14:14.787
NICE DIGS.

14:14.853 --> 14:16.989
IT'S GOOD THING YOU'RE
GETTING R & R, BIG GUY.

14:17.056 --> 14:19.525
A WALL FLOWER, HUH ?

14:27.533 --> 14:28.968
YOU SEE THIS ?

14:29.034 --> 14:30.603
THIS A FORENSIC REPORT.

14:30.669 --> 14:32.504
IT SAYS THAT YOUR DNA
MATCHES THE CELLS

14:32.571 --> 14:35.307
FOUND UNDERNEATH
THE NAILS OF A DEAD BUM.

14:35.374 --> 14:36.842
WE ALSO HAVE
WITNESSES THAT SAY

14:36.909 --> 14:39.411
YOU KILLED THIS
LESS FORTUNATE FELLOW.

14:39.478 --> 14:42.047
WE FOUND
THIS NEARBY.

14:45.317 --> 14:47.386
HE'S DEAD.

14:47.453 --> 14:50.289
I SAW HIM BURNT
TO A CRISP.

14:50.356 --> 14:52.157
BUT HE'S BACK.

14:52.224 --> 14:53.859
THAT'S IT,
I'M GONE.

14:53.926 --> 14:55.194
C'MON, TWITCH.

14:55.261 --> 14:56.762
WHO'S BACK
FROM THE DEAD ?

14:56.829 --> 14:59.231
HE LOOKED AT ME WITH
THOSE GREEN EYES...

15:01.567 --> 15:04.603
THAT CLOAK,
IT REACHED OUT
AND TOUCHED ME

15:04.670 --> 15:05.838
LIKE IT WAS ALIVE.

15:05.904 --> 15:07.673
DID YOU
SAY CLOAK ?

15:16.982 --> 15:19.585
HE'S GONNA DRAG ME
BACK TO HELL.

15:19.652 --> 15:23.289
TELL ME, WHO'S
COME FROM HELL ?

15:23.355 --> 15:28.327
SIMMONS,
AL SIMMONS.

15:36.702 --> 15:38.337
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING ?

15:38.404 --> 15:41.240
JUST CHECKING
SOME DETAILS, SIR.

15:41.307 --> 15:43.609
HOW'S THE CHILI DOG ?

15:43.676 --> 15:45.544
KIND OF LIGHT
ON THE ONIONS.

15:45.611 --> 15:49.982
THAT MAY SIGNAL
A SLIGHT IMPROVEMENT
IN AIR QUALITY.

15:50.049 --> 15:52.885
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH,
WHAT A COMEDIAN.

15:52.951 --> 15:54.920
I'M GONNA
GRAB A SODA.

16:35.627 --> 16:37.896
( phone )

16:43.469 --> 16:45.137
YOU CAME IN
LOOKING FOR ME.

16:45.204 --> 16:46.438
WHY ?

16:46.505 --> 16:49.007
SHALL WE
HAVE A SEAT ?

16:53.145 --> 16:54.947
YOU WROTE SOME ARTICLES
FOR "THE WASHINGTON POST"

16:55.013 --> 16:57.049
ABOUT A SOLDIER
NAMED AL SIMMONS.

16:57.116 --> 16:58.684
THAT'S OLD NEWS,
DETECTIVE,

16:58.751 --> 17:00.452
WHY THE INTEREST ?

17:00.519 --> 17:02.821
I WAS JUST WONDERING
IF YOU COULD OFFER ME

17:02.888 --> 17:05.758
ANYTHING THAT WAS,
TOO SENSITIVE

17:05.824 --> 17:07.726
TO PUT IN PRINT.

17:07.793 --> 17:09.027
LIKE ?

17:09.094 --> 17:10.763
YOU TELL ME.

17:10.829 --> 17:12.731
A MEMBER OF A
SPECIAL OPS GROUP

17:12.798 --> 17:14.633
THAT SAVED THE PRESIDENT
A FEW YEARS BACK.

17:14.700 --> 17:17.102
BUT YOU ALREADY
KNEW ALL THAT...

17:17.169 --> 17:19.371
BEFORE YOU CAME
IN THE DOOR.

17:19.438 --> 17:22.074
I'M LIKE YOU,
I DO MY HOMEWORK.

17:22.141 --> 17:23.876
YOU KNOW WHAT,
TWITCH ?

17:23.942 --> 17:27.346
I LIKE YOU,
YOU'RE A GOOD COP.

17:27.413 --> 17:29.181
AND I'M A GOOD
REPORTER.

17:29.248 --> 17:31.383
AND I KNOW A FLUFF JOB
WHEN I HEAR IT.

17:31.450 --> 17:32.951
SO, LET'S CUT
THE BULLSHIT.

17:33.018 --> 17:36.522
YOU TELL ME SOMETHING,
I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING.

17:36.588 --> 17:38.624
LADIES FIRST.

17:38.690 --> 17:40.392
I WASN'T ALLOWED
TO PRINT THE FACT

17:40.459 --> 17:42.127
THAT AL SIMMONS
WAS BURNED ALIVE

17:42.194 --> 17:45.964
ON A MISSION THAT
THE NSC SAYS DIDN'T HAPPEN.

17:48.434 --> 17:50.335
YOUR TURN.

17:50.402 --> 17:52.137
I'M WORKING
"THE ALLEY MURDERS",

17:52.204 --> 17:54.773
LOOKING FOR A GUY
WITH A RED CLOAK.

17:54.840 --> 17:56.708
I HAVE A PERP
DOWN AT BELLEVUE

17:56.775 --> 17:58.510
THAT SAYS HE
GOT A GOOD LOOK

17:58.577 --> 17:59.912
AT THIS GUY
IN THE ALLEY.

17:59.978 --> 18:01.780
SAYS HE HAS
A BURNED FACE.

18:01.847 --> 18:03.282
NOW YOU TELL ME,

18:03.348 --> 18:05.417
AL SIMMONS
WAS BURNED ALIVE.

18:05.484 --> 18:07.352
COINCIDENCES
DO HAPPEN.

18:07.419 --> 18:09.888
I DON'T BELIEVE
IN COINCIDENCES.

18:09.955 --> 18:13.692
THANK YOU FOR
YOUR TIME, MISS WU.

18:20.999 --> 18:22.501
I SEE THE WAY
YOU LOOK

18:22.568 --> 18:24.069
WHEN YOU
TALK ABOUT AL.

18:24.136 --> 18:25.637
YOU REALLY
LOVED HIM.

18:25.704 --> 18:27.773
HE WAS
MY HUSBAND.

18:27.840 --> 18:31.210
NO, I MEAN
HE WAS "THE ONE".

18:31.276 --> 18:33.846
IS THIS GOING TO
SHOW UP IN THE PAPER ?

18:33.912 --> 18:37.816
THIS IS JUST
YOU AND ME.

18:37.883 --> 18:41.053
WHAT YOU SAID
BEFORE, ABOUT AL,

18:41.119 --> 18:45.390
YOU'RE RIGHT,
HE WAS THAT ONE.

18:47.993 --> 18:51.063
JUST HEARING HIS
VOICE EXCITED ME.

18:51.129 --> 18:53.632
WHEN HE TOUCHED ME...

18:53.699 --> 18:57.102
AFTER HE DIED,
I ACHED FOR HIM.

18:57.169 --> 19:00.539
FOR MONTHS I'D SLEEP
WITH HIS SHIRT OR HIS ROBE,

19:00.606 --> 19:03.208
ANYTHING THAT
SMELLED LIKE HIM.

19:03.275 --> 19:04.776
( Cyan )
MOMMY, WHERE
ARE YOU ?

19:04.843 --> 19:06.612
MOM... MOMMY.

19:06.678 --> 19:08.947
MOMMY'S IN
HERE, SWEET GIRL.

19:09.014 --> 19:10.249
THERE YOU ARE.

19:14.553 --> 19:17.623
HI, YOU'RE
A PRETTY LADY.

19:17.689 --> 19:20.726
I REMEMBER YOU.

19:22.728 --> 19:25.097
I'VE NEVER SEEN HER TAKE
TO SOMEONE SO QUICKLY.

19:25.163 --> 19:26.765
YOU HAVE
A WAY WITH HER.

19:26.832 --> 19:28.767
IS SHE AL'S
CHILD ?

19:28.834 --> 19:32.538
NO, AL COULDN'T
GIVE US A CHILD.

19:34.973 --> 19:36.441
OHH...

19:40.212 --> 19:43.181
WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH
THE NSC AND TERRY ?

19:43.248 --> 19:44.216
HE LOST HIS JOB.

19:44.283 --> 19:45.417
C'MON, CYAN.

19:45.484 --> 19:46.518
I'M GLAD
HE'S NOT THERE.

19:46.585 --> 19:47.719
UP, MOMMY.

19:47.786 --> 19:49.187
WE'RE A LOT
BETTER OFF NOW.

19:49.254 --> 19:53.625
JASON WYNN WILL
TOPPLE OFF THE MOUNTAIN,

19:53.692 --> 19:56.595
IT IS JUST A MATTER
OF TIME, WANDA.

19:56.662 --> 19:58.130
WE ALMOST
LOST EVERYTHING.

19:58.196 --> 19:59.965
AND I STILL CAN'T
TERRY TO TALK ABOUT IT.

20:00.032 --> 20:01.833
HE STAYS AWAY FOR
DAYS AT A TIME.

20:01.900 --> 20:04.102
MAYBE HE'S
PROTECTING YOU.

20:04.169 --> 20:06.238
SOMETIMES
THE TRUTH IS BRUTAL.

20:06.305 --> 20:08.073
IT'S DRIVING
US APART.

20:08.140 --> 20:09.641
SOMETHING'S WRONG.

20:09.708 --> 20:11.710
BUT HE WON'T
LET ME INSIDE.

20:11.777 --> 20:14.379
MAYBE YOU HAVEN'T
GRIEVED AL'S DEATH.

20:14.446 --> 20:17.783
DO YOU SOMETIMES FEEL
THAT HE'S STILL WITH YOU ?

20:19.251 --> 20:21.453
YOU'VE SEEN HIM,
HAVEN'T YOU.

20:21.520 --> 20:22.988
THE CREATURE.

20:23.055 --> 20:24.690
TWICE.

20:24.756 --> 20:26.992
I'VE SEEN WHAT
HE'S CAPABLE OF.

20:27.059 --> 20:28.560
AND I HAVEN'T
TOLD ANYONE.

20:28.627 --> 20:30.696
YOU KNOW WHO IT IS,
DON'T YOU ?

20:30.762 --> 20:33.332
HE SPOKE MY NAME.

20:33.398 --> 20:36.168
THERE WAS SOMETHING
IN HIS VOICE.

20:36.234 --> 20:39.972
I THINK YOU
SHOULD GO NOW.

20:54.620 --> 20:57.155
IF YOU CAN
HEAR ME, AL,

20:57.222 --> 20:59.257
I KNOW
YOU'RE WITH ME.

20:59.324 --> 21:01.526
I FEEL IT.

21:01.593 --> 21:03.629
WANDA...

21:08.600 --> 21:10.669
I'M HUNGRY, MAMA.

21:46.772 --> 21:50.709
I ASK YOU TO STEP OUT
WHERE I CAN SEE YOU,

21:50.776 --> 21:53.045
VERY RESPECTFULLY.

21:59.985 --> 22:03.555
I WARNED THE LAST COP
NOT TO COME INTO MY ALLEY.

22:03.622 --> 22:06.358
ARE YOU
THREATENING ME ?

22:06.425 --> 22:10.328
WHAT WOULD YOU
DO ABOUT IT ?

22:10.395 --> 22:13.131
I'D SHOOT YOU
BETWEEN THE EYES.

22:13.198 --> 22:15.667
DID YOU KILL HIM ?
THE POLICE OFFICER ?

22:15.734 --> 22:18.837
YOU GOT SOME HARD BARK
ON YOU FOR A LITTLE GUY.

22:18.904 --> 22:21.206
NO, I DIDN'T
KILL HIM.

22:21.273 --> 22:23.075
MURDERS HAVE OCCURRED
IN THIS ALLEY.

22:23.141 --> 22:24.876
ONE VICTIM WAS
A HOMELESS MAN.

22:24.943 --> 22:27.045
WE HAVE A SUSPECT
WHO WEARS A SKULL FACE.

22:27.112 --> 22:29.047
A RITUAL
OF SOME KIND.

22:29.114 --> 22:32.417
CHAPEL, I LEFT HIM
ALIVE FOR YOU.

22:32.484 --> 22:34.553
THIS MAN YOU
CALL CHAPEL,

22:34.619 --> 22:36.855
WE HAVE HIM
LOCKED AWAY.

22:36.922 --> 22:38.490
HE'S QUITE
COMPLETELY INSANE

22:38.557 --> 22:40.158
SO, NATURALLY WHEN
HE DESCRIBED YOU,

22:40.225 --> 22:41.727
WE DIDN'T
BELIEVE IT.

22:41.793 --> 22:44.029
YOU BELIEVED IT,
YOU'RE HERE.

22:44.096 --> 22:46.465
HE CLAIMS
YOU'RE AL SIMMONS,

22:46.531 --> 22:50.202
A SOLDIER WHO WAS BURNED
ALIVE FIVE YEARS AGO.

22:50.268 --> 22:52.070
WHAT DO
YOU THINK ?

22:52.137 --> 22:55.741
I THINK YOU'VE
SOMEHOW SURVIVED

22:55.807 --> 22:57.142
A GOVERNMENT
COVER-UP.

22:57.209 --> 22:59.411
YOU'RE CLOSER
THAN YOU THINK.

22:59.478 --> 23:01.646
CAN YOU GET
ME CLOSER ?

23:01.713 --> 23:03.515
YOU WANT TO BE A KNIGHT
IN SHINING ARMOR ?

23:03.582 --> 23:05.851
GO PLAY COPS AND ROBBERS,
FORGET ALL ABOUT THIS.

23:05.917 --> 23:08.086
I WOULDN'T WANT
TO SEE YOUR BODY

23:08.153 --> 23:09.955
DUMPED IN MY ALLEY.

23:10.021 --> 23:14.092
CONFIRM CHAPEL'S
INVOLVEMENT.

23:14.159 --> 23:15.627
CHAPEL WAS
JUST A PUPPET.

23:15.694 --> 23:17.729
THE NSC WAS PULLING
THE STRINGS.

23:17.796 --> 23:20.031
WHO'S THE
PUPPET MASTER ?

23:20.098 --> 23:21.600
WHAT DIFFERENCE
DOES IT MAKE ?

23:21.666 --> 23:23.869
DO YOU THINK YOU CAN
STOP THEM, LITTLE MAN ?

23:23.935 --> 23:25.303
I CAN DO MY BEST.

23:25.370 --> 23:27.839
YOU WERE A
SOLDIER ONCE.

23:27.906 --> 23:29.741
A HERO TO
YOUR COUNTRY.

23:29.808 --> 23:32.144
WHAT HAPPENED TO
YOUR CODE OF HONOR ?

23:32.210 --> 23:34.146
WHEN YOU PLAY
WITH MATCHES,

23:34.212 --> 23:37.115
YOU CAN GET BURNED.

23:37.182 --> 23:41.353
DON'T COME DOWN TO
THESE ALLEYS AGAIN.

23:44.356 --> 23:46.191
( Wynn )
ONE OF YOUR OFFICERS
HAS ACCESSED

23:46.258 --> 23:48.093
SOME OF MY FILES,
CHIEF BANKS.

23:48.160 --> 23:49.227
WHY ?

23:49.294 --> 23:50.529
I don't know
anything about it.

23:50.595 --> 23:53.365
THE ONLY GUY HERE CAPABLE OF
DOING THAT WOULD BE TWITCH.

23:53.431 --> 23:54.800
OFFICER WILLIAMS.

23:54.866 --> 23:57.135
You asked
about him before.

23:57.202 --> 23:59.337
He's working on
the killings in the alley.

23:59.404 --> 24:00.772
FIND OUT
WHAT HE KNOWS.

24:00.839 --> 24:02.774
AND AFTER I GET
THE INFORMATION

24:02.841 --> 24:04.176
FROM OFFICER WILLIAMS ?

24:04.242 --> 24:07.646
I UNDERSTAND THAT
NEW YORK'S FINEST

24:07.712 --> 24:09.481
WHO ARE KILLED
IN THE LINE OF DUTY

24:09.548 --> 24:11.716
ARE GIVEN QUITE
A HERO'S BURIAL.

24:11.783 --> 24:13.518
Just tell me where
to send the flowers,

24:13.585 --> 24:14.953
Chief Banks.

24:30.735 --> 24:32.771
( Twitch )
I SPOKE WITH
THE RED CLOAKED MAN

24:32.838 --> 24:34.339
HERE, IN THIS PLACE.

24:34.406 --> 24:36.908
I BELIEVE HE'S STILL
SOMEWHERE IN THESE ALLEYS.

24:36.975 --> 24:38.877
OKAY, I'M GONNA
TAKE A LOOK AROUND.

24:38.944 --> 24:40.512
CHECK IT OUT.

24:46.017 --> 24:47.786
THIS GOES ALL
THE WAY UP

24:47.853 --> 24:50.021
TO A HIGH OFFICIAL
IN THE NSC.

24:50.088 --> 24:52.023
AND WHO WOULD
THIS OFFICIAL BE ?

24:52.090 --> 24:53.692
THE ONLY MAN WHO
CAN MAKE DECISIONS

24:53.758 --> 24:55.694
AT THIS LEVEL
IS JASON WYNN.

24:55.760 --> 24:57.729
MY INSTINCT IS
THAT THE SUSPECT

24:57.796 --> 24:59.164
WE HAVE DOWN
AT BELLEVUE

24:59.231 --> 25:00.932
IS ONE OF HIS
ASSASSINS.

25:00.999 --> 25:02.500
THAT'S QUITE
A STORY, TWITCH.

25:02.567 --> 25:05.070
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVE
A VERY SOLID LEAD.

25:05.136 --> 25:07.839
YOU'VE DONE
WELL, OFFICER.

25:07.906 --> 25:10.408
THE DEPARTMENT
IS PROUD OF YOU.

25:10.475 --> 25:12.244
THANK YOU, SIR.

25:34.833 --> 25:36.468

HARD FROM HIS HEAD.
