00:39.538 --> 00:42.632
Ha ha ha. Take
that, Master Chen.

00:42.707 --> 00:44.142
Jake?

00:44.209 --> 00:45.644
What?

00:45.712 --> 00:47.908
Jake, did you hide my sock?

00:47.981 --> 00:49.005
No, man.

00:49.082 --> 00:51.813
I told you... I don't do
that kind of stuff anymore.

00:51.885 --> 00:53.251
So, what?

00:53.318 --> 00:55.015
It just magically disappeared?

00:55.088 --> 00:58.081
I don't know.

00:58.158 --> 00:59.821
Maybe.

00:59.894 --> 01:02.728
Is that just a cute way
of saying you took it?

01:02.797 --> 01:03.797
No!

01:03.864 --> 01:05.456
Why don't you just
help me find my sock?

01:05.532 --> 01:07.058
Oh, Finn lost his sock!

01:07.134 --> 01:08.625
Everybody stop what you're doing

01:08.703 --> 01:12.196
and help Finn find
his precious sock!

01:13.174 --> 01:15.769
<i>It looked like a
tough case to crack,</i>

01:15.843 --> 01:19.111
<i>but... I hate to see
good friends fight.</i>

01:19.182 --> 01:21.776
<i>So I decide to take the case.</i>

01:26.956 --> 01:27.956
Hmm.

01:28.857 --> 01:30.758
Ronnie.

01:32.161 --> 01:34.687
<i>It looked like I had
a guilty mouse.</i>

01:52.517 --> 01:53.609
Hello, Ronnie.

01:53.684 --> 01:55.779
What do you want, Beemo?

01:57.155 --> 01:58.886
Where is Finn's sock?

01:58.958 --> 02:01.517
I don't know what you're
talking about, Beemo.

02:01.593 --> 02:03.392
I didn't do nothing.
Leave me alone!

02:05.965 --> 02:08.433
<i>I knew that lipstick anywhere.</i>

02:08.501 --> 02:09.627
How is Lorraine?

02:09.702 --> 02:11.432
You stay away from her!

02:11.504 --> 02:13.497
She's with me now. Do you hear?

02:13.573 --> 02:15.336
Calm down, big guy.

02:15.407 --> 02:18.344
Me and Lorraine are...
dinosaur bones.

02:18.411 --> 02:21.109
<i>Good. 'Cause I would
be so jealous.</i>

02:22.150 --> 02:25.484
Just tell me where the sock
is, and I will let you go.

02:25.553 --> 02:27.020
I don't know, man.

02:27.087 --> 02:29.524
What if I put some knuckle
in your eyeballs?

02:29.591 --> 02:31.080
Would that help you think?

02:31.158 --> 02:32.821
Okay! Okay!

02:32.894 --> 02:34.192
Um...

02:34.262 --> 02:37.255
it looks like a grape-juice
stain on his sock.

02:37.331 --> 02:39.630
Check the pantry.

02:39.700 --> 02:43.103
<i>Of course, I didn't
trust Ronnie.</i>

02:43.172 --> 02:45.368
<i>But I had no other leads.</i>

02:45.440 --> 02:48.376
<i>Maybe the grape juice had
some secrets to tell me.</i>

02:48.443 --> 02:52.643
<i>Or maybe Ronnie was
just pulling my hair.</i>

02:56.151 --> 02:57.347
Ugh.

02:57.420 --> 03:00.151
<i>Just as I thought...
Not even opened.</i>

03:00.223 --> 03:02.125
<i>I fell right into his trap.</i>

03:04.260 --> 03:05.820
Let me out, you!

03:05.896 --> 03:07.524
I will get you!

03:07.598 --> 03:09.363
Piece of you, Ronnie!

03:09.434 --> 03:10.366
Oof!

03:10.433 --> 03:14.065
Oh. Officer Davis. Thank goodness.
I...

03:14.138 --> 03:15.971
Beemo, what are you doing here?

03:16.041 --> 03:18.373
Looking for Finn's sock...
Same as you.

03:18.442 --> 03:20.605
We got this under control.

03:20.679 --> 03:22.614
Stay out of police business,

03:22.681 --> 03:26.482
or you will be the
one behind bars.

03:26.551 --> 03:29.020
<i>I didn't listen to that cop.</i>

03:29.087 --> 03:31.250
<i>I needed to find Ronnie.</i>

03:31.324 --> 03:35.990
<i>And I knew just the lady
who could lead me to him.</i>

03:39.900 --> 03:42.460
<i>She looked as beautiful as ever.</i>

03:43.637 --> 03:45.765
Where is the sock, Lorraine?

03:45.839 --> 03:48.308
What makes you think I know?

03:48.375 --> 03:50.845
I saw your lipstick on his fur,

03:50.912 --> 03:52.904
so don't act so cute.

03:52.981 --> 03:56.440
It sounds like
somebody's jealous, no?

03:56.517 --> 03:59.043
Don't count on it, Lorraine.

03:59.120 --> 04:01.454
Now, tell me where Ronnie is.

04:01.523 --> 04:04.152
Ha! You think it was Ronnie?

04:04.226 --> 04:06.990
<i>Maybe if he was man
enough to steal a sock,</i>

04:07.061 --> 04:10.430
I wouldn't have spent
my nights with Bebe.

04:10.499 --> 04:12.991
Bebe?!

04:13.068 --> 04:15.971
<i>So you are saying
Bebe is man enough?</i>

04:16.039 --> 04:17.063
What? No.

04:17.139 --> 04:19.507
You are putting
words in my mouth.

04:19.576 --> 04:22.546
Bebe doesn't know anything
about Finn's sock.

04:22.612 --> 04:25.946
<i>Finn's sock?</i>

04:26.017 --> 04:29.180
How do you know it
was Finn's sock?

04:29.252 --> 04:32.746
I never said whose sock
was stolen, Lorraine.

04:32.823 --> 04:34.417
I, um, um...

04:34.493 --> 04:36.620
I heard it on the TV news.

04:36.694 --> 04:38.687
No dice, sweet beak.

04:38.764 --> 04:42.428
Officer Davis has this
case under tight wraps.

04:42.501 --> 04:44.594
Uh, uh... fine!

04:44.669 --> 04:47.105
Bebe stole the sock! Okay?

04:47.172 --> 04:48.231
Oh, Beemo.

04:48.307 --> 04:50.174
Can't you just forget about it?

04:50.243 --> 04:51.267
Sorry, lady.

04:51.344 --> 04:53.836
Forgetting ain't in
my job description.

04:55.147 --> 04:58.550
Does this mean you
still remember... us?

05:02.989 --> 05:06.654
Ha ha. Same old Lorraine.

05:06.727 --> 05:11.427
Well, don't tell Ronnie
about me and Bebe.

05:11.498 --> 05:14.526
You know how he gets
when he's jealous.

05:18.873 --> 05:23.743
<i>Bebe owned Bebe's, a
dance club downtown.</i>

05:23.812 --> 05:25.804
<i>He yells at ladies.</i>

05:28.116 --> 05:29.346
<i>Wake up, brainiac.</i>

05:29.418 --> 05:31.409
Beemo? Aah! Aah!

05:31.486 --> 05:32.921
Arrgh!

05:32.989 --> 05:34.925
Where is the sock, Bebe?

05:34.991 --> 05:37.359
Uh...

05:37.427 --> 05:39.657
I don't know nothin'
'bout socks!

05:39.729 --> 05:41.323
Don't play dumb, Bebe.

05:41.398 --> 05:42.922
Don't play dumb with me.

05:46.103 --> 05:47.867
I talked to Lorraine, Bebe.

05:47.938 --> 05:49.464
She sold you out, dum-dum.

05:49.540 --> 05:52.032
No! She... she wouldn't do that!

05:52.110 --> 05:54.101
It wasn't me! I swear!

05:54.177 --> 05:55.976
<i>It was Ronnie!</i>

05:56.047 --> 05:58.209
Ronnie? But why?

05:58.282 --> 06:00.582
I don't know, man. I don't know.

06:01.986 --> 06:03.420
Oh, Lorraine.

06:06.358 --> 06:09.385
I'm gonna go wash this
schmutz off my grabbers.

06:09.461 --> 06:13.398
When I get back, you better
start talking sense.

06:17.870 --> 06:19.339
<i>It wasn't adding up.</i>

06:19.406 --> 06:21.841
<i>Why would Ronnie swipe the sock?</i>

06:21.908 --> 06:24.537
<i>And why would
Lorraine finger Bebe?</i>

06:24.611 --> 06:30.142
<i>Sure, he's a dirtbag born out
of a mother, but who's not?</i>

06:30.217 --> 06:31.742
I don't really get it.

06:31.819 --> 06:36.189
<i>Maybe it was time
to cut my losses.</i>

06:36.257 --> 06:38.749
Come on, Bebe. Let's
get you cleaned up.

06:38.826 --> 06:41.193
Bebe?

06:41.262 --> 06:43.390
Bebe!

06:43.464 --> 06:45.524
Dead!

06:45.600 --> 06:48.298
This doesn't look good.
I better hightail it!

06:48.371 --> 06:50.965
Huh?! The cops!

06:51.039 --> 06:53.304
It was a setup!

06:53.375 --> 06:55.811
Oh. Oh, no.

06:55.878 --> 06:57.641
Bang, bang! Pyoo! Pyoo! Pyoo!

07:01.617 --> 07:02.779
Whoa!

07:02.853 --> 07:04.480
Ugh!

07:04.554 --> 07:05.647
Ugh! Ugh!

07:05.721 --> 07:06.951
Ohh...

07:07.024 --> 07:09.858
ugh...

07:09.927 --> 07:12.089
Hey, has anyone seen Beemo?

07:12.161 --> 07:13.824
Beemo!

07:13.897 --> 07:15.866
Where's Beemo?

07:15.933 --> 07:18.096
Hello?

07:18.169 --> 07:22.538
<i>With the lipstick, she
looked as beautiful as ever.</i>

07:25.578 --> 07:27.944
I'm worried about Beemo.

07:33.586 --> 07:35.987
This is real.

07:36.055 --> 07:37.853
Beemo!

07:37.923 --> 07:39.916
Who's Beemo?

07:45.097 --> 07:46.259
Hello?

07:46.333 --> 07:48.632
Hello? Hello?

07:48.702 --> 07:51.365
Hello? Hello? Hello?

07:51.438 --> 07:54.033
Hey, Beemo. Wake up, buddy.

07:54.107 --> 07:55.736
Are you all right?

07:57.078 --> 08:01.812
I feel like I got hit with
a Dracula by King Kong.

08:01.883 --> 08:03.283
Whoa. Sorry, man.

08:03.351 --> 08:05.412
You want some pie or something?

08:05.487 --> 08:08.615
Sorry. I gotta run. The
cops are after me.

08:08.689 --> 08:10.556
Have you seen any down here?

08:10.625 --> 08:13.027
Nah. No one's been
down here all day,

08:13.096 --> 08:15.860
except me, you, and Ronnie.

08:15.931 --> 08:18.127
What?! What was Ronnie
doing down here?

08:18.200 --> 08:19.133
I don't know.

08:19.201 --> 08:20.693
But now my sensors indicate

08:20.770 --> 08:22.329
that some treasure is missing.

08:22.405 --> 08:25.068
About a sock's worth.

08:25.141 --> 08:26.473
That's it!

08:26.543 --> 08:28.274
That's why Ronnie
took the sock...

08:28.345 --> 08:30.677
To carry stolen
treasure in with!

08:30.747 --> 08:33.649
He had to whack Bebe to
keep him from squealing.

08:33.716 --> 08:35.447
Then, he pinned the rap on me.

08:35.519 --> 08:37.249
Bebe's dead?

08:37.321 --> 08:40.450
Listen, NEPTR, you better
lay low for a while.

08:40.524 --> 08:42.390
I'm gonna go find Ronnie.

08:42.460 --> 08:44.452
I've got a score to settle.

08:44.529 --> 08:45.758
Hey, Beemo.

08:45.830 --> 08:47.957
We should hang out more.

08:48.032 --> 08:49.695
We're both robots.

08:49.768 --> 08:53.762
<i>No, NEPTR. I am not like you.</i>

08:58.444 --> 08:59.742
- Ronnie?
- Evening, Beemo.

09:01.481 --> 09:04.541
Don't worry, buddy.
You're off the hook.

09:04.617 --> 09:06.609
We know it was Ronnie
who killed Bebe

09:06.686 --> 09:08.952
<i>and snatched the treasure.</i>

09:09.022 --> 09:12.584
We found this confession
on him after the shootout.

09:12.659 --> 09:15.185
Hmm. What about the sock?

09:15.262 --> 09:18.790
Forget the sock, Beemo.
The case is closed.

09:18.865 --> 09:21.699
Let it go, buddy. It's over.

09:21.768 --> 09:22.998
<i>Maybe he was right,</i>

09:23.071 --> 09:26.371
<i>but I just couldn't shake
the feeling that, somehow,</i>

09:26.441 --> 09:31.244
<i>this case had slipped
right through my fingers.</i>

09:31.313 --> 09:32.542
Lipstick?

09:37.720 --> 09:39.212
Ohh! Ohh!

09:45.762 --> 09:46.890
Lorraine!

09:46.964 --> 09:48.898
Beemo?

09:48.965 --> 09:51.332
Get back here with that
treasure, Lorraine!

09:51.401 --> 09:55.169
Sorry, Beemo. I
earned this loot.

09:55.239 --> 09:58.333
<i>Those chumps were not
framing themselves.</i>

09:58.408 --> 10:00.071
See you around, Beemo.

10:00.144 --> 10:01.942
Lorraine! Wait!

10:02.013 --> 10:04.073
What about the sock, Lorraine?

10:04.148 --> 10:05.741
Oh. That old thing?

10:05.816 --> 10:09.309
I hid that where no one
would ever find it...

10:09.387 --> 10:12.085
In our secret grown-up
kissing spot.

10:12.157 --> 10:14.820
Remember?

10:14.893 --> 10:17.260
It was good to see
you again, Beemo.

10:17.329 --> 10:19.628
'Til next time.

10:22.368 --> 10:24.428
'Til next time, Lorraine.

10:26.840 --> 10:28.136
You see, man?

10:28.206 --> 10:29.368
That was really fun.

10:29.442 --> 10:31.707
<i>You don't need two
socks to have fun.</i>

10:31.778 --> 10:34.146
Yeah. I guess.

10:34.214 --> 10:36.307
<i>But maybe it would have been
more fun with two socks.</i>

10:37.718 --> 10:39.653
Finn! Finn! I know
where your sock is.

10:39.720 --> 10:41.087
Huh?

10:41.156 --> 10:43.181
It was in your pillow
this whole time. See?

10:43.257 --> 10:45.227
Whoa!

10:45.293 --> 10:46.521
Right on, Beemo!

10:46.593 --> 10:48.256
Ronnie the Mouse stole it,

10:48.330 --> 10:51.197
but Lorraine Chicken set
him up to kill Bebe.

10:51.265 --> 10:53.235
But the flatfoots busted Ronnie,

10:53.301 --> 10:56.272
and Lorraine skedaddled
with the loot.

10:56.339 --> 10:58.274
But Beemo solved the case!

10:58.341 --> 11:00.640
Yay, Beemo! Yeah! Yeah!

11:00.710 --> 11:01.733
Yay, Beemo!

11:01.811 --> 11:02.811
Yay!

11:02.878 --> 11:04.245
Yay, Beemo!

11:04.314 --> 11:06.748
Our chicken's name is Lorraine?

11:06.816 --> 11:09.980
She's red-hot like pizza supper.
