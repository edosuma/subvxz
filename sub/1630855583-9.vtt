Ben?
Everyone gets opening night jitters!

00:06.673 --> 00:08.800
- I'm good.
- My review was going to be a pan.

00:08.800 --> 00:12.054
This one... just didn't sing.

00:12.054 --> 00:14.139
NYPD, motherfuckers!

00:14.139 --> 00:16.140
The stalker, he didn't do it!

00:16.140 --> 00:18.936
The killer is someone in this room.

00:18.936 --> 00:21.396
We've got to get in on those interviews.

00:21.396 --> 00:24.316
The spooky sound from opening night.

00:24.316 --> 00:26.360
Someone was in here shredding something.

00:26.360 --> 00:28.403
We need to reassemble these.
There might be a clue.

00:28.904 --> 00:31.907
<i>We have the interrogations on tape.</i>

00:31.907 --> 00:33.617
<i>We recorded everything.</i>

<i>These aren't photos of Ben.
They're photos of Dickie.</i>

00:40.707 --> 00:44.545
When he was gone for those
brief moments, I felt free.

00:44.545 --> 00:46.088
And then he was back.

00:46.088 --> 00:48.340
<i>I couldn't take it anymore.</i>

00:48.340 --> 00:50.217
You spend your whole life
looking out for your child,

00:50.217 --> 00:52.845
and you'll do anything
to make sure they're okay.

00:54.888 --> 00:57.057
Wait! I did it. I killed Ben.

00:57.057 --> 00:59.810
No, you can't do this! Leave her alone!

00:59.810 --> 01:01.311
Oh, my God...

01:01.311 --> 01:03.689
Oliver? What's going on? Oliver!

He had a heart attack.

You did great with the first two.

Mabel! Mabel!
- Wah!

02:05.417 --> 02:07.544
Mabel!

02:07.544 --> 02:09.254
The doctor said I can finally go home.

02:09.254 --> 02:11.256
- What? No, no, no, no, no.
- Yeah.

02:11.256 --> 02:14.051
The man had a full-on
heart attack five days ago.

02:14.051 --> 02:15.511
You rush him in here,

02:15.511 --> 02:18.013
stick in a stent to prop up
his creaky artery.

02:18.013 --> 02:19.765
- Nobody said creaky.
- Now, you're just gonna go

02:19.765 --> 02:21.517
and send him off into the world?

02:21.517 --> 02:23.143
Mabel, I need to get back.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.811
My show opens in two days,

02:24.811 --> 02:26.813
and my star is about
to be charged with murder.

02:26.813 --> 02:29.191
Doctor, maybe you should
just run a few more tests to be sure?

02:29.191 --> 02:31.985
His body responded
very well to the stent.

02:31.985 --> 02:34.655
Although I'm sure it was
quite a scare for all of you.

02:34.655 --> 02:36.156
I wasn't scared.

02:36.156 --> 02:37.616
Oh, is that so?

02:37.616 --> 02:40.786
You know, I was just pretending to be
unconscious when I heard you wailing,

02:40.786 --> 02:42.829
"I can't let him go!

02:42.829 --> 02:45.582
Come back to me,
you sweet son of a bitch!"

02:45.582 --> 02:47.334
I was doing
a performance for the nurses.

02:47.334 --> 02:49.044
They're big fans of mine.
What am I gonna do?

02:49.044 --> 02:50.629
Not be Charles-Haden Savage?

02:50.629 --> 02:52.631
Oh, admit it.
You're obsessed with me.

02:52.631 --> 02:54.842
Can't believe I actually missed this.

02:55.926 --> 02:57.970
Come on, Putnam. We've got work to do.

02:57.970 --> 02:59.304
Yes, yes, yes.
Let's go.

02:59.304 --> 03:01.515
<i>For starters,</i>

03:01.515 --> 03:05.352
if Loretta made up her confession
to protect her son,

03:05.352 --> 03:07.479
don't we need to <i>prove</i> that her son

03:07.479 --> 03:09.648
is Ben's real killer to get her out?

03:09.648 --> 03:11.275
Loretta's been in jail a few days now.

03:11.275 --> 03:14.528
I wonder if she's shaved her head
and gotten all <i>jacked.</i>

03:15.028 --> 03:18.031
I can't let her take the fall for this.
She's the love of my life.

03:18.031 --> 03:20.701
Love?
I thought you were just hooking up.

03:20.701 --> 03:23.370
Oh, we hooked up.

03:23.370 --> 03:25.414
We hooked up big time.

03:25.414 --> 03:28.458
We hooked up and down
and every which direction.

03:28.458 --> 03:30.752
You name a way, we did a hook.
- Okay, alright, thank you. Enough. Okay.

03:30.752 --> 03:33.463
I promise we will get her home to you.

03:33.463 --> 03:35.549
No matter how many
face tattoos she has now.

03:35.549 --> 03:37.634
Charles, did you learn anything

03:37.634 --> 03:40.804
from those police interrogations
we so skillfully recorded?

03:40.804 --> 03:42.431
Actually, we haven't watched them yet.

03:42.431 --> 03:44.600
We were sitting by your
bedside this whole time.

03:44.600 --> 03:47.394
Mabel wanted to wait
so you could be a part of it.

03:47.394 --> 03:48.395
Little softy.

03:48.395 --> 03:49.938
- Aw!
- No! I--

03:49.938 --> 03:51.440
I didn't-- It wasn't like I was like,

03:51.440 --> 03:54.193
"Let's hold hands and watch it together."
It was just like...

03:55.277 --> 03:56.403
Shut up.

03:56.403 --> 03:59.489
Okay, we're focusing on Dickie.

03:59.489 --> 04:02.117
Loretta clearly thinks that he's guilty.

04:02.117 --> 04:04.703
That's why she confessed to protect him.

04:04.703 --> 04:06.163
Ben was poisoned,

04:06.163 --> 04:08.498
and then later
pushed down the elevator shaft.

04:08.498 --> 04:12.252
But, we don't know whose hanky
he was holding onto

04:12.252 --> 04:15.130
when he died.
I mean, it could be Dickie's.

04:15.631 --> 04:19.218
We know that someone wrote
"fucking pig" in lipstick on his mirror,

04:19.218 --> 04:21.345
and we have footage of him
in a heated moment

04:21.345 --> 04:23.180
talking to an unseen person,

04:23.180 --> 04:24.765
possibly a lover.

04:24.765 --> 04:28.477
C-Can we just take a beat
to appreciate how magical this is?

04:29.144 --> 04:32.856
The three of us, reunited at last,
investigating as one.

04:32.856 --> 04:36.318
Mabel, you stayed faithful to the podcast.

04:36.318 --> 04:38.070
You should take the lead.

04:38.070 --> 04:40.072
Just... the besties are back.

04:40.072 --> 04:42.241
Ooh! That should be our opening line!

04:42.241 --> 04:44.201
You just said Mabel
should take the lead.

04:44.201 --> 04:46.203
Can't I make a suggestion?

04:46.203 --> 04:48.622
I narrowly escaped death,
and now you won't let me live?

04:48.622 --> 04:50.832
Oh, wah, wah.

04:50.832 --> 04:52.835
- Wah, wah!
- Wah, wah!

04:52.835 --> 04:54.837
Oh, this is fucking weird.

04:54.837 --> 04:58.173
Okay, okay.
The besties are back.

04:59.508 --> 05:01.760
The besties are back.

05:01.760 --> 05:04.012
It may take two to tango,

05:04.012 --> 05:06.598
but it takes three to solve the murder

05:06.598 --> 05:09.476
of an ill-fated movie star.

- I'll take this.
- Yeah.

Oh, yeah. Her dad, too. In fact,

07:08.971 --> 07:10.556

07:10.556 --> 07:12.015
Yeah. Us neither.

07:12.015 --> 07:14.434
Hey, you wanna hear something funny?
For a <i>minute</i>,

07:14.434 --> 07:15.811
we thought you did it.

07:17.604 --> 07:19.106
You did? Wh-Why?

07:19.106 --> 07:22.609
Ah, it's so dumb. We, um,

07:22.609 --> 07:25.529
we just know he stole CoBro from you.
Uh-huh.

07:25.529 --> 07:26.780
Oh.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.449
Shit. Really?

07:30.534 --> 07:34.162
Okay. Yeah, I was resentful.

07:34.162 --> 07:37.833
Yeah, and you told me
you cover up things,

07:37.833 --> 07:41.461
so I kinda figured you
covered up his blood work

07:41.461 --> 07:43.630
to hide the poison in his system.

07:44.173 --> 07:45.465
I did do that.

07:46.091 --> 07:48.302
I mean, I didn't know he was poisoned
when I did it.

07:48.302 --> 07:51.180
I just knew there was other stuff in there
he wouldn't want getting out.

07:52.222 --> 07:53.557
Wait, you believe me, right?

07:53.557 --> 07:55.642
Oh, of course. Yes.

07:55.642 --> 07:57.311
Out of curiosity,

07:57.311 --> 08:00.439
where were you when Ben
was pushed to his death?

08:00.439 --> 08:02.441
Because <i>you</i> weren't pushing him, obviously.

08:02.441 --> 08:05.903
E-Everyone knows that.
But, uh, unless...

08:05.903 --> 08:07.613
I left your party early.

08:07.613 --> 08:11.158
I was freaked the fuck out
that Ben came back to life

08:11.158 --> 08:12.701
and I had to get outta there.

08:13.869 --> 08:15.495
So, I...

08:17.748 --> 08:20.250
I got wasted,
put on Ben's CoBro suit,

08:20.250 --> 08:22.294
and went looking for drugs and whores.

08:22.878 --> 08:25.088
- Well, who wouldn't?
- Wow.

08:25.088 --> 08:26.798
Why should he have all the fun?

08:26.798 --> 08:28.759
That's what Ben was into?

08:28.759 --> 08:32.137
Every Thursday,
he'd disappear for hours.

08:32.137 --> 08:35.641
And when I asked about it,
he'd say, "Snitches get stitches."

08:36.683 --> 08:40.020
So, I tracked his phone
to a place on Broadway

08:40.020 --> 08:42.147
between 35th and 36th,

08:42.147 --> 08:43.732
where he'd go to...

08:44.441 --> 08:47.569
do sex with his "five whores,"

08:47.569 --> 08:50.906
as he so affectionately called them.

08:50.906 --> 08:53.575
He even saved
opening night seats for them.

08:53.575 --> 08:57.538
Uh, Trixie, Marigold,
Emerald, Dot, and Mei Mei.

08:57.538 --> 08:59.248
Here.

09:03.669 --> 09:05.963
I was outside, screaming for them

09:05.963 --> 09:08.048
to bring me the five whores.

09:08.048 --> 09:10.217
I slept there all night.

09:10.217 --> 09:11.718
A dog peed on me.

09:12.886 --> 09:14.429
I hope it was a dog.

09:15.264 --> 09:19.059
This is proof you weren't at the Arconia
when Ben was pushed.

09:19.059 --> 09:21.436
The cops got that image
from a security camera

09:21.436 --> 09:23.146
after I told them where I was,

09:23.146 --> 09:24.815
but they didn't really buy it as an alibi,

09:24.815 --> 09:26.859
since you can't fully see my face.

09:27.609 --> 09:30.612
I guess I should just be
grateful there isn't audio.

09:33.282 --> 09:35.576
I just can't believe Loretta did it.

09:35.993 --> 09:39.663
Well, for what it's worth,
w-we don't think she really did do it.

09:40.539 --> 09:42.583
But why else would she confess?

09:43.208 --> 09:45.627
- No idea.
- Oh, yeah, theater folk, cuckoo!

09:47.671 --> 09:48.797
Wait a minute.

09:50.215 --> 09:51.925
If you guys think
the killer's still out there,

09:51.925 --> 09:53.927
I should probably call my lawyer.

09:58.140 --> 10:00.058
Hm.

10:00.058 --> 10:02.019
Guys, if he's telling the truth,

10:02.019 --> 10:03.437
he couldn't have pushed Ben.

10:03.437 --> 10:06.607
That means that Loretta gave herself up
for someone who didn't even do it.

10:06.607 --> 10:08.192
If we can find the real killer in time,

10:08.192 --> 10:11.153
maybe we can convince Loretta
to take back her confession.

10:11.153 --> 10:13.322
Charles, her arraignment is at 5:00 p.m.

10:13.322 --> 10:16.783
We need to figure out what Ben was doing
and who he was seeing

10:16.783 --> 10:19.578
in the last few days
leading up to his death.

10:19.578 --> 10:22.247
I say we start at Broadway and 35th.

10:22.247 --> 10:25.584
Except we can't just walk into a brothel
without a reservation.

10:28.128 --> 10:29.755
I know what we need.

10:29.755 --> 10:32.049
Nobody stops a guy with a ladder!

10:32.049 --> 10:35.427
It gets you in anywhere.
- So the ladder's the new turkey.

10:35.427 --> 10:37.179
It might work better
if the guy carrying the ladder

10:37.179 --> 10:38.972
wasn't also wearing orthopedic shoes

10:38.972 --> 10:41.099
and dressed like a leprechaun.
- Hm.

10:41.099 --> 10:42.476
Hey, hey, this is it.

10:44.144 --> 10:46.647
Snitches Get Stitches?

10:46.647 --> 10:50.359
It's a fabric shop.
- No, no, no, no, no. It's a front.

10:50.359 --> 10:53.570
Brothels always use puns
to name their fake businesses.

10:53.570 --> 10:55.948
I learned that by wandering
in the back of a cabinet shop

10:55.948 --> 10:58.075
called All By My Shelf.

10:58.075 --> 11:00.494
Follow my lead!
Let the ladder do the work.

11:00.494 --> 11:02.454
Wait a second! I have a better way in.

11:02.454 --> 11:04.039
No one says no to a crying man.

11:04.039 --> 11:06.458
I did a scene in <i>Brazzos</i>, episode 315.

11:06.458 --> 11:08.752
<i>The Foreign Exchange Killer.</i>
It was a good one.

11:08.752 --> 11:11.255
And I cried a single solitary tear.

11:11.255 --> 11:14.132
And that week, our fan mail went sky high.

11:14.132 --> 11:16.051
Mostly from men.
You wanna know why?

11:16.051 --> 11:18.512
You helped them access
their inner feelings.

11:18.512 --> 11:20.097
Yes.

11:20.097 --> 11:21.890
But just gimme a go.
Gimme the stage.

11:21.890 --> 11:23.600
No, no, no, no.

11:23.600 --> 11:26.270
Me first.
Stop it!

11:27.437 --> 11:29.940
Just here to change a light bulb!

11:29.940 --> 11:31.733
No, you can't go back there.

11:31.733 --> 11:33.777
Of course not, dude.

11:34.820 --> 11:37.239
We all know what's going on
in the back room.

11:37.239 --> 11:38.699
Wink, wink.

11:38.699 --> 11:40.951
But did you see my ladder?

11:49.626 --> 11:51.170
I'm sorry. Is my crying upsetting you?

11:51.170 --> 11:52.713
You're not crying.

11:52.713 --> 11:54.423
Give it a minute.

12:00.262 --> 12:01.638
This guy's made of stone.

12:01.638 --> 12:03.432
Do you have any menthol
for under the eyes?

12:03.432 --> 12:05.267
Yeah, I have a bucket of menthol.

12:09.938 --> 12:13.066
Do you need a restroom?
We have one in the back.

12:13.817 --> 12:17.237
- Oh! Thank you so much. Get in there.
- Thanks.

12:17.237 --> 12:18.238
Ooh!

12:23.535 --> 12:25.621
You're the five whores?

12:26.580 --> 12:28.165
Please ignore him!

12:28.165 --> 12:30.959
I'm sorry. We were just looking
for a group of women

12:30.959 --> 12:32.794
who might have known Ben Glenroy,

12:32.794 --> 12:34.338
but we'll just get out of the way.
- Sorry.

12:34.338 --> 12:35.631
Benny!

12:35.631 --> 12:38.342
Oh, yes! We knew him!

12:38.342 --> 12:41.803
Our sewing circle met here every Thursday.

12:41.803 --> 12:45.015
Benny said sewing kept him off

12:45.015 --> 12:47.518
all those dangerous street drugs.

12:48.268 --> 12:51.021
We miss him terribly.

12:53.273 --> 12:54.775
When was the last time you saw him?

12:54.775 --> 12:56.610
Oh, um,

12:56.610 --> 13:00.572
his big opening night of <i>Death Rattle.</i>

13:02.908 --> 13:06.203
<i>We'd stayed up all night helping him sew</i>

13:06.203 --> 13:09.998
<i>these lovely hankies for his cast and crew</i>

13:09.998 --> 13:11.834
<i>while running lines.</i>

13:12.334 --> 13:15.838
"Everyone else in that lighthouse
is dead, Nanny.

13:15.838 --> 13:19.758
So the killer is either you, me,
or the baby."

13:19.758 --> 13:25.097
"I wouldn't bet on that baby, detective."

13:25.097 --> 13:28.225
He wanted to make
something special for them.

13:28.225 --> 13:30.185
Something personal.

13:30.185 --> 13:33.146
He said he treated a lot of them

13:33.146 --> 13:36.066
like a steaming pile of cow manure.

13:36.984 --> 13:40.153
<i>We finished those hankies just in time,</i>

13:40.153 --> 13:42.823
<i>and off Benny went to the theater.</i>

13:42.823 --> 13:43.949
Thank you. Thank you.

13:43.949 --> 13:45.659
I'm gonna see you all
at the theater, ladies.

13:45.659 --> 13:47.452
- We're rooting for you. Bye.
- Love you.

13:47.452 --> 13:49.037
<i>But then...</i>

13:49.913 --> 13:51.915
Mei Mei, my phone.

13:56.920 --> 13:59.173
BEN [on phone]:
<i>Uh, hey!</i>

13:59.173 --> 14:01.466
<i>It's, uh, it's me. It's Benny.</i>

14:01.466 --> 14:02.926
<i>Um...</i>

14:02.926 --> 14:05.637
<i>A-Are you guys coming to the show?</i>

14:05.637 --> 14:08.140
<i>I really need you t-to be here.</i>

14:08.140 --> 14:11.852
<i>Uh, I've just never felt... so alone.</i>

14:11.852 --> 14:14.146
OLIVER [on phone]: <i>Ben?</i>

14:14.146 --> 14:17.941
<i>Everyone gets opening night jitters!
I can talk you through it.</i>

14:17.941 --> 14:19.526
That's me just before curtain.

14:19.526 --> 14:21.320
BEN [on phone]:
<i>I-I gotta go. Please get here soon.</i>

14:21.320 --> 14:24.531
<i>I'm surrounded by people I can't trust.
They're all out to get me.</i>

14:25.282 --> 14:28.327
It's so hard to hear him like that.

14:28.327 --> 14:32.331
He was so excited for us to see the show.

14:33.832 --> 14:36.001
- Alright. Okay. Okay.
- Thank you.

14:36.001 --> 14:38.212
- Sorry.
- Thank you. Sorry. Thank you so much.

14:39.254 --> 14:40.506
Oh, this...

14:41.590 --> 14:44.218
It's a gift for you. It's a-a ladder.

14:44.218 --> 14:45.511
Oh, thank you!

14:45.511 --> 14:46.970
Sorry for calling you whores.

14:46.970 --> 14:48.931
Oh, that's alright.

14:48.931 --> 14:50.682
I used to be one.

14:51.808 --> 14:55.020
Okay. That's... interesting. Bye.

14:56.021 --> 14:58.899
So what happened from
the time Ben arrived at the theater,

14:58.899 --> 15:02.861
on top of the world,
to leaving a distressed voicemail

15:03.445 --> 15:05.906
30 minutes later?
I mean,

15:05.906 --> 15:07.699
who did he think was out to get him?

15:07.699 --> 15:11.203
I already know how we can find out.
The interrogations.

15:11.203 --> 15:14.498
Williams questioned everyone
who crossed paths with Ben that night,

15:14.498 --> 15:16.458
and we can use those interrogations

15:16.458 --> 15:18.877
to make a timeline of that 30 minutes!

15:19.962 --> 15:23.799
Ah! I knew you were due for a good idea
since your last one six months ago.

15:23.799 --> 15:25.217
- Huh?
- When you proposed

15:25.217 --> 15:27.928
we go halfsies on
a <i>New Yorker</i> digital subscription.

15:27.928 --> 15:29.721
- That was your idea.
- Oh, good.

15:29.721 --> 15:32.558
You owe me $32,
and I'm keeping the free tote.

15:32.558 --> 15:34.184
Shh, guys.

15:34.184 --> 15:35.644
KT's up first.

15:36.520 --> 15:39.940
KT [on video]: <i>All actors must be at
the theater for what we call "half hour."</i>

15:39.940 --> 15:43.735
<i>Boots on the ground
30 minutes before curtain.</i>

15:43.735 --> 15:46.655
<i>Not 28, not 29, 30.</i>

15:48.323 --> 15:49.825
<i>Ben, of course, was late.</i>

15:52.995 --> 15:55.122
Check it!
I have gifts for everyone.

15:55.122 --> 15:58.083
Where the fuck have you been?
Get into costume!

15:58.083 --> 15:59.334
Go!

15:59.334 --> 16:01.170
KT sure knows how to kill a mood.

16:01.170 --> 16:04.256
Someone should really talk to her
about her tone.

16:05.048 --> 16:07.759
- Oh, the producer's son is up next.
- Oh, Cliff.

16:07.759 --> 16:11.054
<i>I saw Ben right after
KT yelled at him.</i>

16:11.763 --> 16:13.807
<i>Not a fan of her tone.</i>

16:13.807 --> 16:16.476
Schmackary's?
They're so good.

16:16.476 --> 16:18.145
Mom ordered them special.

16:18.145 --> 16:20.189
Check out the rattles.
Can you even?

16:20.939 --> 16:24.026
You know what, get those away from me.
I'm fasting till after the show.

16:25.319 --> 16:26.904
Wait! No.

16:27.779 --> 16:29.198
Let me just smell 'em.

16:30.324 --> 16:32.284
Oh, g--

16:32.284 --> 16:33.911
I said get them away from me!

16:34.786 --> 16:38.081
Hey, listen. I need you to check
on my five guests for tonight.

16:38.081 --> 16:41.585
Emerald, Trixie, Marigold,
Dot, and Mei Mei.

16:42.252 --> 16:43.754
The five whores.

16:44.963 --> 16:47.466
Sorry. I--
That's how I learned them in my brain.

16:48.383 --> 16:49.760
Charles, can you scooch a little?

16:49.760 --> 16:51.929
- Sure.
- Thanks.

16:51.929 --> 16:54.431
So that's new.
Ben was fasting before the show.

16:55.557 --> 16:57.184
Let's keep going.

16:57.184 --> 16:59.311
DICKIE [on computer]:
<i>I'll admit, I was furious with Ben.</i>

16:59.311 --> 17:01.063
<i>I mean, who shows up late
to his opening night?</i>

17:01.063 --> 17:04.066
<i>It was always something with him,
which is why...</i>

17:05.359 --> 17:09.238
<i>Loretta was encouraging me
to leave him.</i>

17:11.073 --> 17:13.075
I just...

17:13.075 --> 17:17.246
I just think you deserve
so much better, you know?

17:17.246 --> 17:19.831
Look at your arm. Aw...

17:20.374 --> 17:22.459
These are stress hives.

17:22.459 --> 17:24.294
I call 'em "Benny bites."

17:25.754 --> 17:28.590
What about that
cortisone cream I gave you?

17:28.590 --> 17:30.551
Did you use that?
I did.

17:30.551 --> 17:34.346
How did we not get
that she's his mother?

17:34.346 --> 17:36.181
I feel she's about to give him a bottle.

17:36.974 --> 17:39.142
Doesn't Loretta look pretty?

17:39.977 --> 17:42.229
And did you make
that list of bullet points

17:42.229 --> 17:43.939
to say when you quit?

17:43.939 --> 17:46.817
That always helps me, I tell you.

17:46.817 --> 17:48.110
Sure. Yeah.

17:48.110 --> 17:49.778
Uh-oh, incoming.

17:51.113 --> 17:53.156
- Hey!
- You losers passing notes?

17:53.699 --> 17:56.201
Okay, I'm gonna go warm up.

17:57.411 --> 17:59.037
See you at fight call.

18:00.998 --> 18:03.000
Give it!

18:06.336 --> 18:07.588
Wait, what is this?

18:09.715 --> 18:10.757
Are you quitting?

18:11.341 --> 18:13.802
I was gonna wait till after the show.

18:19.600 --> 18:21.185
Sh-She put you up to this.

18:21.185 --> 18:23.270
'Cause you know fucking Loretta,
she's been...

18:23.270 --> 18:25.397
she's been driving a wedge
between us from day one.

18:25.397 --> 18:27.357
It's not Loretta! It's you!

18:27.733 --> 18:31.361
I've spent my entire life
catering to the great Ben Glenroy!

18:31.361 --> 18:34.156
Who we all know isn't exactly
a delight to be around!

18:34.156 --> 18:36.116
See bullet point four!

18:36.116 --> 18:37.117
Ju--

18:37.576 --> 18:39.620
You know what? Fine. Alright, fine. Go.

18:39.620 --> 18:41.038
Fuck if I care!

18:43.332 --> 18:45.292
You're a lousy manager anyway.

18:45.292 --> 18:47.211
And you know what?
And you're an even lousier brother.

18:47.211 --> 18:48.629
I know you think you created it,

18:48.629 --> 18:50.547
but I <i>am</i> CoBro!

18:52.883 --> 18:54.593
Actually, no. You know what?

18:54.593 --> 18:56.428
The way you just betrayed me?

18:56.428 --> 18:58.347
I'm NoBro.

18:58.347 --> 19:00.140
Because I don't have a brother anymore.

19:07.189 --> 19:10.067
Loretta was
encouraging Dickie to leave Ben?

19:10.067 --> 19:12.194
Messy, messy. Who's next?

19:12.194 --> 19:15.489
<i>After Ben arrived, I went to KT's office
to get the ritual broom.</i>

19:16.323 --> 19:17.533
<i>The door was locked,</i>

19:17.533 --> 19:19.368
<i>which I thought was odd.</i>

19:20.869 --> 19:22.663
That's odd.

19:28.502 --> 19:31.046
I'll do a progress check
on the shredder.

19:32.923 --> 19:36.844
And so, it was the brilliant
Howard Francis Morris

19:36.844 --> 19:38.387
who cracked the case

19:38.387 --> 19:39.930
by-- Oh, fuckity fuck!

19:42.057 --> 19:43.892
Howard says he needs more time.

19:43.892 --> 19:45.269
If I'm not mistaken,

19:45.269 --> 19:47.813
next up is Ben and Loretta's
fight call rehearsal.

19:47.813 --> 19:50.732
Oh, she told me about this on our date.

19:50.732 --> 19:54.528
<i>Well, Ben accused me of
trying to steal Dickie from him.</i>

19:54.528 --> 19:56.196
<i>And this was just moments</i>

19:56.196 --> 19:59.157
<i>after he learned his brother was quitting.</i>

20:03.745 --> 20:06.748
You're late.
- Whatever. Let's just do this.

20:07.833 --> 20:10.043
That's enough, Detective.

20:10.043 --> 20:11.879
I'm not gonna let you take that baby.

20:11.879 --> 20:14.006
You are just a nanny.

20:14.006 --> 20:16.383
You can't keep him.
You're not the mother.

20:16.383 --> 20:19.219
He needs me to be
his mother now.

20:19.219 --> 20:22.764
It's my job to protect him
as if he were born of my own flesh!

20:22.764 --> 20:24.850
Wow, this dialogue really lines up.

20:24.850 --> 20:27.519
What are you...

20:27.519 --> 20:29.605
Stay out of our lives!

20:29.605 --> 20:30.856
- What?
- I mean it!

20:30.856 --> 20:33.025
Stay the fuck away from my brother.

20:34.067 --> 20:36.028
He's been nothing but loyal to you!

20:36.028 --> 20:37.237
All you do is treat him like shit!

20:37.237 --> 20:39.156
You weaseled your way
into this production.

20:39.156 --> 20:42.367
No! Let me go, you fucking pig.
Hey, look.

20:42.367 --> 20:43.535
There's me.

20:43.535 --> 20:44.870
God, I'm pale.

20:44.870 --> 20:46.038
What the hell's going on?

20:46.038 --> 20:47.748
Is that what I sound like?

20:47.748 --> 20:49.458
He attacked me!

20:49.458 --> 20:51.835
What? No, I didn't.
We were rehearsing.

20:51.835 --> 20:54.755
Stay out of it, fuck bag.
- Hey!

20:57.966 --> 20:59.343
That's...

21:00.552 --> 21:02.054
My face!

21:07.392 --> 21:08.936
I still can't believe you hit him.

21:08.936 --> 21:11.188
Well, why don't you add
"for good reason" to the board?

21:11.188 --> 21:13.815
Or "Charles punches Ben
and he had it coming"?

21:13.815 --> 21:16.568
Anyway, this is where Joy comes in
to touch up the bruise,

21:16.568 --> 21:19.655
which wasn't that bad anyway.
- Yeah, easy, Cassius.

21:19.655 --> 21:23.617
Joy leaves her lipstick behind
in Ben's dressing room, and...

21:24.576 --> 21:26.912
who's the next person to see him?

21:29.039 --> 21:31.583
DONNA [on computer]: <i>I did see Ben, yes.</i>

21:31.583 --> 21:35.295
<i>It was right after I gave
Cliff a little pep talk.</i>

21:38.090 --> 21:40.175
My tummy is in knots.

21:40.175 --> 21:41.969
Oh, it's almost showtime.

21:41.969 --> 21:44.513
I've put everything into this play.
I need it to be a hit.

21:44.513 --> 21:47.599
Oh, it will be.
I won't let you fail, sweetie.

21:47.599 --> 21:49.768
Here's a kiss from Mommy.

21:49.768 --> 21:51.144
Hey!

21:51.144 --> 21:53.814
Wh-Where are my guests?
I don't see them in their seats.

21:53.814 --> 21:55.732
Yeah, I think traffic's pretty bad.

21:55.732 --> 21:57.901
Something's happening at the UN.
I don't know what.

21:57.901 --> 22:01.613
You know, I'm boycotting global politics
until everyone just gets along.

22:02.823 --> 22:03.824
Fuck.

22:03.824 --> 22:05.325
I'm going to be straight with you, Ben.

22:05.325 --> 22:08.370
It's opening night,
and you look like shit.

22:08.370 --> 22:09.997
Can you see a mark?

22:09.997 --> 22:13.125
- What?
- It's f-fucking Charles and Loretta.

22:13.125 --> 22:14.751
I-I'm done with them both!

22:14.751 --> 22:17.337
I don't know what's
going on with you, darling,

22:17.337 --> 22:19.548
but this is not a good energy.

22:19.548 --> 22:21.008
Go to your dressing room.

22:21.008 --> 22:22.676
Be nice to Ben.

22:22.676 --> 22:26.180
Do whatever it takes
to get your ass ready to go on that stage.

22:26.180 --> 22:28.098
Alright.

22:29.683 --> 22:31.727
Oh, hey, you're here!

22:31.727 --> 22:33.562
Yeah, where the shit else would I be?

22:33.562 --> 22:36.398
Right. Well, how about we start shooting
some behind-the-scenes stuff, huh?

22:36.982 --> 22:39.610
Look, dude, you--
I-I'm not an animal in your zoo.

22:39.610 --> 22:41.069
What?

22:41.069 --> 22:42.779
I'm doing the thing
you're paying me to do.

22:42.779 --> 22:45.532
- You know what? Not anymore.
- Wait!

22:45.532 --> 22:48.118
Gimme that!
Why don't you fuck the fuck off?

22:48.118 --> 22:50.913
You know what? Fucking happy to!

23:00.547 --> 23:03.592
So, Ben takes Tobert's camera

23:03.592 --> 23:07.012
into his dressing room
where he's caught talking to somebody.

23:07.012 --> 23:08.430
Watch.

23:10.057 --> 23:12.434
<i>I want you so fucking bad.</i>

23:14.520 --> 23:16.813
<i>But you're gonna ruin my career.</i>

23:17.856 --> 23:19.358
<i>And I'm gonna like it.</i>

23:19.358 --> 23:21.193
Who the hell is he talking to?

23:21.193 --> 23:23.570
Everyone's accounted for.

23:23.570 --> 23:26.865
This, my friends,
is what we call a dead end.

23:30.869 --> 23:33.872
I told Ben, "I know what you did."

23:35.415 --> 23:37.417
But I didn't have the whole picture.

23:38.418 --> 23:41.421
H-His brother was leaving him.

23:41.421 --> 23:42.923
I punched him.

23:43.674 --> 23:46.301
He was fasting.

23:46.301 --> 23:49.680
His elderly sewing ladies
got stuck in UN traffic

23:49.680 --> 23:51.306
and didn't even see the show.

23:51.849 --> 23:53.350
And all this goes on

23:53.350 --> 23:56.270
30 minutes before his Broadway debut

23:56.270 --> 24:00.065
after being up all night
making hankies for everybody?

24:01.316 --> 24:02.818
Oh, my God.

24:04.403 --> 24:08.323
It was Ben who needed a hanky to cry into.

24:09.116 --> 24:10.909
Oh jeez!

24:10.909 --> 24:12.077
Oh!

24:12.077 --> 24:15.330
The damn has burst!

24:20.794 --> 24:22.045
Nah, there's a little bit.

24:22.045 --> 24:24.173
There's a little something.
- Eh, not much.

24:24.173 --> 24:25.674
Thank God that's over.

24:28.427 --> 24:31.722
Ben must have been poisoned
in that pocket of time

24:31.722 --> 24:33.599
by whoever he was talking to.

24:33.599 --> 24:36.018
If we could just figure out--
Give it up.

24:36.018 --> 24:38.020
We don't know what we don't know.

24:38.020 --> 24:40.689
Sorry, Oliver.
I don't think we're gonna solve this

24:40.689 --> 24:43.066
in time to free Loretta.

24:44.401 --> 24:45.903
I suppose it's fine.

24:47.029 --> 24:50.073
I guess I'll just die sad and alone.

24:50.616 --> 24:53.619
Wanna know how I was able
to access those tears just now?

24:54.494 --> 24:56.246
I thought about Joy.

24:56.246 --> 24:58.790
Seeing her wedding dress
was like a punch in the gut.

24:59.166 --> 25:01.293
I hear she's with Bakula now.

25:01.293 --> 25:03.003
Scott or Jeff?

25:03.003 --> 25:05.714
Scott. Who's Jeff Bakula?

25:05.714 --> 25:07.841
Meh, I have both of you beat

25:07.841 --> 25:10.511
in the "we're losers" competition.

25:10.511 --> 25:13.555
I still don't have my life figured out,

25:13.555 --> 25:17.267
I haven't solved this case,
and I have no place to live.

25:17.267 --> 25:18.644
Still lost.

25:18.644 --> 25:21.063
You don't have to have it
all worked out. You've got time.

25:21.063 --> 25:23.565
Yeah, well, tell that
to 10-year-old Mabel.

25:25.108 --> 25:27.653
This is a MASH
from when I was a kid.

25:29.029 --> 25:31.532
You know, the game
that tells you your future?

25:32.491 --> 25:33.992
Anyway, mine predicted

25:33.992 --> 25:36.703
that I would be married to Josh Hartnett,

25:36.703 --> 25:38.789
with two kids,

25:38.789 --> 25:41.124
driving a Honda Odyssey.

25:41.542 --> 25:44.461
I was so sure this MASH was right.

25:46.088 --> 25:50.008
I made my mom promise to send it
to me when I turned 30.

25:50.008 --> 25:53.387
Came in the mail today, so perfect timing.

25:53.387 --> 25:54.847
Wait.

25:54.847 --> 25:56.974
Are you saying today's
your 30th birthday?

25:58.809 --> 26:01.645
And you spent it running around
looking for clues with the two of us?

26:01.645 --> 26:04.690
Honestly, there's no way
I'd rather spend it.

26:07.401 --> 26:08.944
What do you think
10-year-old Mabel would say

26:08.944 --> 26:10.946
if she could see how your life
actually turned out?

26:10.946 --> 26:12.781
Oh, she'd be horrified.

26:12.781 --> 26:15.450
But what the fuck did she know?
She shopped at Wet Seal.

26:15.450 --> 26:17.452
I did it!

26:17.452 --> 26:19.872
I solved the shredder paper!

26:19.872 --> 26:21.498
But I've been taping too long.

26:21.498 --> 26:24.126
My vision's gone blurry.
I can't read it.

26:24.126 --> 26:26.211
- No, no, o-over here. Yes, okay.
- Oh, you're over here.

26:29.882 --> 26:32.801
OM God! I know what this is.

26:32.801 --> 26:34.928
- That fast?
- No, I just need to read two words.

26:34.928 --> 26:36.096
Two words I'll never forget.

26:36.096 --> 26:37.931
"Didn't sing."

26:37.931 --> 26:41.435
This is Maxine's review
of my original show,

26:41.435 --> 26:42.686
but it was never published.

26:42.686 --> 26:44.771
How did someone get ahold of this?
Two words.

26:44.771 --> 26:47.274
I need to get LASIK,
and he only needed two words.

26:48.233 --> 26:50.444
What is that?
- Torn paper?

26:50.444 --> 26:52.821
I need to tape it together.

26:52.821 --> 26:54.907
Look what you've turned me into!

26:54.907 --> 26:56.533
Ow.

26:56.533 --> 26:59.328
This review says Ben
was the weak link of the show.

26:59.328 --> 27:02.998
She said, "He was as wooden
as the lighthouse he's standing on."

27:03.540 --> 27:05.542
What if someone read this that night?

27:05.542 --> 27:08.337
Maybe they decided
to get rid of Ben to save the play.

27:08.337 --> 27:10.547
There are a lot of careers
riding on it being a hit.

27:10.547 --> 27:14.051
Not mine, of course.
I came to it as an established TV veteran.

27:14.051 --> 27:16.553
- Yes, and thank you for your service.
- Guys?

27:17.471 --> 27:19.014
This could be our motive.

27:19.014 --> 27:20.974
Now we're getting somewhere!

27:20.974 --> 27:22.392
I-I need to refuel.

27:22.392 --> 27:24.978
Charles, please tell me
you have some dips...

27:24.978 --> 27:27.064
I think there's some
Norwegian red herring in the fridge.

27:28.941 --> 27:31.610
Hey, did that review
mention my performance?

27:31.610 --> 27:35.155
Huh? Oh, uh, no. Nothing.

27:35.155 --> 27:37.074
Really? 'Cause I kinda
had a big, big role--

27:37.074 --> 27:39.117
Charles, don't.

27:39.117 --> 27:41.703
♪ Happy birthday to you! ♪

27:41.703 --> 27:44.665
Happy birthday to you!

27:44.665 --> 27:48.168
♪ Happy birthday, dear Mabel ♪

27:48.168 --> 27:50.379
♪ Happy birthday to you! ♪

27:50.379 --> 27:51.964
- You're flat, horrible.
- I know.

27:51.964 --> 27:54.174
Thank you, guys.

27:54.174 --> 27:55.425
Come on. Make a wish.

27:56.426 --> 27:59.179
Ah, yes.
Hey, come on. Sit down.

27:59.596 --> 28:01.682
There you go.

28:01.682 --> 28:03.934
Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

28:03.934 --> 28:06.436
They tried to keep us apart,

28:06.436 --> 28:10.148
make me stick to my heart-healthy diet,

28:10.148 --> 28:11.942
but you found your way back to me.

28:11.942 --> 28:14.695
Oliver, keep going.

28:14.695 --> 28:16.446
Yeah-- Why?

28:16.446 --> 28:18.282
I know you feel it, too.

28:18.282 --> 28:21.326
You want me--
No, you <i>need</i> me to tear into you,

28:21.326 --> 28:24.454
you naughty little mistress.

28:24.454 --> 28:26.957
I know who Ben was talking to.

28:28.041 --> 28:29.084
- Wait!
- Gimme that!

28:29.084 --> 28:30.377
Why don't you fuck the fuck off?

28:31.086 --> 28:34.089
TOBERT [muffled]: <i>You know what?
Fucking happy to!</i>

28:53.525 --> 28:55.027
You're not supposed to be here.

28:55.861 --> 28:57.863
We both know you're bad.

29:06.538 --> 29:08.540
God, I want you.

29:10.083 --> 29:12.085
I want you so fucking bad.

29:14.046 --> 29:16.048
But we both know you'll ruin my career

29:18.842 --> 29:20.135
and I'm gonna like it.

29:37.736 --> 29:38.570
Mm!

29:39.196 --> 29:40.697
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

29:40.697 --> 29:42.616
<i>Oh!</i>

29:54.044 --> 29:55.796
<i>What the fuck did you just do?</i>

29:58.590 --> 30:00.092
<i>You ate the whole thing.</i>

30:02.427 --> 30:04.137
<i>You're disgusting.</i>

30:07.099 --> 30:08.600
Loretta was right.

30:08.600 --> 30:10.227
You're a fucking pig.

30:11.812 --> 30:13.856
You're a fucking pig!

30:15.482 --> 30:19.319
You're a fucking pig.
You... are...

30:19.319 --> 30:22.322
a fucking... pig!

30:23.657 --> 30:26.243
Pig!

30:26.243 --> 30:29.079
Pig! [oinking] You're a fucking pig!

30:33.959 --> 30:36.461
Fucking pig!

30:54.646 --> 30:58.400
TRIXIE [on phone]: <i>This is Trixie.
Please leave me a message.</i>

30:58.400 --> 31:00.485
Uh, hey!

31:00.485 --> 31:02.863
It's, uh, it's me. It's Benny.

31:02.863 --> 31:04.364
Um...

31:04.364 --> 31:06.617
A-Are you guys coming to the show?

31:06.617 --> 31:09.328
I really need you t-to be here.

31:09.328 --> 31:10.621
Uh...

31:10.621 --> 31:13.540
I've just never felt so alone.

31:13.540 --> 31:15.959
OLIVER [muffled]: <i>Ben!</i>

31:15.959 --> 31:18.921
<i>Everyone gets opening night jitters!
I can talk you through it.</i>

31:18.921 --> 31:21.507
I-I gotta go. Please get here soon.

31:21.507 --> 31:24.468
I'm surrounded by people I can't trust.
They're all out to get me.

31:38.273 --> 31:40.275
Uh...

31:42.861 --> 31:43.862
I'm good.

31:44.738 --> 31:45.739
I'm good.

31:47.282 --> 31:50.285
This whole time,
it wasn't <i>who</i> Ben was talking to.

31:50.285 --> 31:52.162
It was <i>what.</i>

31:52.162 --> 31:55.123
You think if those last 30 minutes
hadn't been so brutal,

31:55.123 --> 31:57.042
maybe Ben wouldn't have
needed to eat that cookie.

31:57.042 --> 31:58.502
Maybe he'd still be alive.

31:59.294 --> 32:00.546
That cookie!

32:02.548 --> 32:03.841
It was from Donna.

32:04.466 --> 32:07.094
Mabel, what did that review say
about Ben's performance?

32:07.094 --> 32:10.347
It said he was as wooden
as the lighthouse.

32:10.347 --> 32:13.141
Donna said that exact thing
at <i>sitzprobe.</i>

32:13.141 --> 32:15.143
She'd read the review.

32:15.143 --> 32:18.188
A-And you know, she was always bragging
about her connection to the paper.

32:18.188 --> 32:21.441
I bet she sweet-talked someone
into slipping her a copy.

32:21.441 --> 32:23.569
She'd sabotage her own play?

32:23.569 --> 32:25.571
It wasn't hers.

32:27.072 --> 32:28.490
It was her son's.

32:28.490 --> 32:30.742
His first production.

32:30.742 --> 32:32.619
And if it had been panned,

32:32.619 --> 32:35.122
it could have also been his last.

32:40.836 --> 32:44.131
So, let's say Donna
gets her hands on the review

32:45.132 --> 32:48.760
which says Ben is
the weak link of the show.

32:55.517 --> 32:56.768
HOWARD [muffled]:
<i>That's odd.</i>

33:07.237 --> 33:09.489
She spots the rat poison.

33:12.367 --> 33:14.077
Then, the cookie.

33:15.037 --> 33:17.623
And she gets the idea to poison Ben.

33:42.314 --> 33:44.983
<i>She leaves him the cookie,
knowing it's his weakness,</i>

33:44.983 --> 33:47.069
<i>and that he's in a bad spot emotionally.</i>

33:47.069 --> 33:49.530
<i>The perfect temptation.</i>

33:49.530 --> 33:52.699
<i>All she has to do now
is make sure he eats the cookie.</i>

33:52.699 --> 33:56.370
Go to your dressing room.
Be nice to Ben.

33:56.370 --> 34:00.207
Do whatever it takes to get your ass ready
to go on that stage.

34:00.207 --> 34:02.209
Yeah.

34:04.336 --> 34:06.505
Oh, hey, you're here!

34:06.505 --> 34:08.423
Yeah, where the shit else would I be?

34:08.423 --> 34:10.008
Right. Well, how about we start shooting

34:10.008 --> 34:11.301
some behind-the-scenes stuff, huh?

34:11.301 --> 34:14.513
Look, dude, you--
I-I'm not an animal in your zoo.

34:14.513 --> 34:17.307
So, we have our motive, the review.

34:17.307 --> 34:19.518
We have the murder weapon, a cookie.

34:19.518 --> 34:21.979
And when the cookie doesn't work,

34:21.979 --> 34:24.857
she pushes him down the elevator shaft.

34:24.857 --> 34:26.984
She was in and out
of that party all night.

34:26.984 --> 34:29.361
She could have easily
made a murderous pit stop.

34:29.361 --> 34:30.612
So

34:31.321 --> 34:33.740
we have our killer, Donna.

34:33.740 --> 34:35.450
Which means we can get Loretta out!

34:35.450 --> 34:37.160
I-I don't know.

34:37.160 --> 34:39.121
Her arraignment's in 20 minutes,

34:39.121 --> 34:40.831
and the courthouse is way downtown.

34:40.831 --> 34:42.541
And I'm all out of ladders.

34:42.541 --> 34:44.877
And I can't cry twice in one day.

34:44.877 --> 34:47.588
Unless I think of my dad. Or my mom.

34:47.588 --> 34:49.590
Or any moment from my childhood.

34:50.716 --> 34:52.259
Mabel, what is it?

34:52.259 --> 34:54.386
Nobody stops a bride.

34:59.558 --> 35:02.060
I still don't get why you guys wore tuxes.

35:02.060 --> 35:04.062
Oh, I never miss
a chance to put on my tux.

35:04.062 --> 35:06.565
Last time I wore this was 1987 Emmys.

35:06.565 --> 35:08.233
Wait, wait! That means... Hey!

35:08.233 --> 35:10.027
Bebe Neuwirth's phone number!
- Ah!

35:10.027 --> 35:11.653
Oh! Oh, oh, oh!
Oh no!

35:11.653 --> 35:13.363
A bride needs a cab, please.

35:13.363 --> 35:16.408
Bride. Bride needs a cab.
Oh, thank you.

35:16.408 --> 35:19.077
You, out. You, in.
Thank you, ma'am!

35:19.077 --> 35:20.287
That's very good.

35:20.287 --> 35:21.997
<i>Wanna know what I wished for</i>

35:21.997 --> 35:25.292
<i>over that birthday candle
stuck in a tub of dip?</i>

35:26.043 --> 35:27.044
<i>You're looking at it.</i>

35:27.044 --> 35:28.086
Thank you--

35:28.921 --> 35:32.049
<i>Me with my two besties doing murder stuff.</i>

35:32.049 --> 35:33.050
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

35:33.050 --> 35:34.968
<i>Not a bad life.</i>

35:34.968 --> 35:37.387
Wait. Whoa, whoa.
Slow down. Y'all got an appointment?

35:37.387 --> 35:39.389
It's my wedding, ma'am.

35:39.389 --> 35:41.391
And you guys are, what, her two dads?

35:41.391 --> 35:43.393
That's right.
We're the fathers of the bride.

35:43.393 --> 35:45.354
- Oh, that's fun.
- So you got a groom in there?

35:45.854 --> 35:48.732
Why does there
always have to be a groom?

35:49.858 --> 35:51.860
- Many happy returns.
- Thank you.

35:55.364 --> 35:56.990
There she is.

35:56.990 --> 35:58.367
Loretta, wait!

36:00.619 --> 36:03.038
Oliver, what are you doing here?

36:03.038 --> 36:05.374
I came to stop you. Don't plead guilty.

36:05.374 --> 36:08.627
Wow. You look... great in orange.

36:08.627 --> 36:10.462
Oh! I do?

36:10.462 --> 36:12.756
Thanks.

36:13.674 --> 36:15.926
You look really nice, too.

36:15.926 --> 36:17.553
- I do?
- Mm-hmm.

36:17.553 --> 36:19.805
Oh, this old thing. I...

36:19.805 --> 36:21.098
We know who murdered Ben.

36:21.807 --> 36:23.225
You only confessed to save Dickie,

36:23.225 --> 36:24.893
but he didn't do it.
And we can prove that.

36:24.893 --> 36:28.105
You have to trust me.
- I do.

36:28.105 --> 36:31.483
I trust you. I just...

36:31.483 --> 36:34.486
I've gone down this road
so far already.

36:37.948 --> 36:39.449
Who do you think did it?

36:39.449 --> 36:41.660
Um, Oliver?

36:41.660 --> 36:44.246
♪ dramatic sting ♪

36:46.582 --> 36:49.042
Fuckity fuck.
