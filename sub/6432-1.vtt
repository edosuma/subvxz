00:00.300 --> 00:01.698
<i>Previously on Warehouse 13...</i>

00:02.533 --> 00:04.435
You got what you wanted,
now get out.

00:04.670 --> 00:05.903
No, this is just step one.

00:05.937 --> 00:08.942
This is an artifact
nuclear device.

00:08.976 --> 00:10.645
Helena, what are you doing?

00:10.679 --> 00:11.780
You've protected us
from the blast.

00:17.690 --> 00:20.726
Mrs. Frederic!

00:20.761 --> 00:25.132
That was his plan,
to destroy the entire warehouse.

00:25.167 --> 00:27.771
We lost, Artie.

00:27.805 --> 00:30.107
Not yet.

01:49.739 --> 01:51.273
Artie.

01:51.307 --> 01:53.876
Artie. Artie!

01:53.910 --> 01:56.345
What did you mean?
About what?

01:56.380 --> 01:58.281
What did you mean
when you said, "not yet"?

01:58.316 --> 02:01.685
The watch. Is it...
is it something?

02:01.720 --> 02:03.954
Is it some kind of a...
a warehouse rebuilder?

02:03.989 --> 02:07.225
Oh, my God. Lavoisier's law
of the conservation of mass.

02:07.260 --> 02:09.193
Matter cannot be created,
nor can it be destroyed.

02:09.228 --> 02:10.895
It's lavoisier's watch,
isn't it?

02:10.930 --> 02:15.067
It can somehow
reconstitute matter, right?

02:15.102 --> 02:16.202
- Myka...
- Well, thank God.

02:16.236 --> 02:17.670
I mean, what are you
waiting for, Artie?

02:17.704 --> 02:19.706
Wave the watch
and rebuild the warehouse.

02:19.740 --> 02:21.941
Do you think you can bring back
Steve and H.G. Too?

02:21.976 --> 02:25.112
Listen to me, this watch
is not a rebuilder.

02:25.147 --> 02:26.514
It's not a reconstituter.

02:26.548 --> 02:29.617
Wait, you said,
"not yet," Artie.

02:29.652 --> 02:31.720
Please have something
up your sleeve.

02:31.754 --> 02:34.156
Artie, if we ever needed
some sort of warehouse magic,

02:34.190 --> 02:35.958
now would be the time.
Look.

02:35.992 --> 02:39.329
All I can tell you is that this
is some kind of a key

02:39.363 --> 02:41.998
to what might be
a fail-safe device.

02:42.033 --> 02:44.668
I- I don't know.

02:44.702 --> 02:47.271
- Artie?
- Can you feel that?

02:47.305 --> 02:50.541
All I feel is really sad.

02:50.576 --> 02:53.377
Exactly.

02:53.412 --> 02:56.748
Oh, dear God, no.

02:56.782 --> 02:57.816
Artie, Artie,
where are you going?

02:57.850 --> 02:59.818
Where are you going?

03:04.323 --> 03:06.491
Artie, what is that?

03:06.492 --> 03:08.692
It was ytterbium chamber.

03:08.693 --> 03:11.693
What's important... The what now?

03:11.697 --> 03:13.698
Nothing any more.

03:13.733 --> 03:16.334
It was made of pure lutetium.
It's the hardest metal on earth.

03:16.368 --> 03:20.239
And I had hoped that it would
survive and protect the...

03:20.273 --> 03:22.174
Protect the what?

03:22.208 --> 03:23.542
Just can't be
absolutely certain

03:23.576 --> 03:25.411
until I've checked
the television.

03:25.445 --> 03:26.412
I got to go to Leena's.

03:26.446 --> 03:28.348
Oh, now I know he's lost it.

03:28.382 --> 03:30.083
He never watches television.

03:30.118 --> 03:33.287
Okay, so the watch
might lead us to an artifact.

03:33.321 --> 03:36.690
We have no idea what
or where that artifact is.

03:36.725 --> 03:37.892
Or if it has a downside.

03:37.926 --> 03:39.493
Nor do I know what
that artifact might do.

03:39.528 --> 03:41.129
I don't even know
what the watch does.

03:41.163 --> 03:42.564
All right, well,
we should ask Mrs. Frederic.

03:42.598 --> 03:47.203
She'll know what to...

03:47.237 --> 03:51.775
I imagine Mrs. Frederic
is gone?

03:51.809 --> 03:55.345
Gone? What... what do you mean
she's gone?

03:55.379 --> 03:56.579
She collapsed, and then just...

03:56.614 --> 03:58.381
she just disappeared
right in front of us.

03:58.415 --> 04:01.551
Mrs. Frederic
is... is dead?

04:01.585 --> 04:03.420
Wait, so when the warehouse
was destroyed...

04:03.454 --> 04:05.255
- the warehouse was what?
- Destroyed?

04:05.289 --> 04:06.623
The bomb destroyed
the whole place?

04:06.657 --> 04:07.623
Listen to me, listen to me.

04:08.926 --> 04:10.660
Please, everyone! If we
are gonna get through this,

04:10.694 --> 04:12.795
we have to take a deep breath
and you have to focus.

04:12.830 --> 04:14.631
Now, Leena, Claudia...

04:14.665 --> 04:18.500
The bomb that Walter Sykes
set off was far more powerful

04:18.535 --> 04:19.702
than we imagined.

04:19.736 --> 04:22.103
We only survived
because H.G. Wells insulated us

04:22.137 --> 04:24.139
from the blast,
and she was killed.

04:24.174 --> 04:25.941
Oh, my God.

04:25.975 --> 04:28.944
Pete, Myka...
Mrs. Frederic, as caretaker

04:28.978 --> 04:31.747
of Warehouse 13, was organically
connected to the warehouse,

04:31.781 --> 04:35.417
and when it was taken,
she went with it.

04:38.520 --> 04:40.755
So...

04:49.465 --> 04:51.400
Trailer.

04:56.373 --> 04:59.641
All right, look, um...

04:59.675 --> 05:01.410
Take a deep breath
and focus, right?

05:01.444 --> 05:03.545
Okay, all right, come on.
Artie, let's go.

05:03.580 --> 05:05.413
Use the watch.
Watch?

05:05.448 --> 05:07.549
What watch?
MacPherson's watch?

05:07.583 --> 05:09.183
Artie, I thought you didn't
know how that worked.

05:09.218 --> 05:10.418
I don't.

05:10.452 --> 05:12.119
We also don't know
if it has a downside.

05:12.154 --> 05:13.721
Well, yeah, but what
difference does it make?

05:13.755 --> 05:15.490
Well, it's a danger
that we have to consider.

05:15.524 --> 05:18.659
Who cares?
Mrs. Frederic is dead.

05:18.693 --> 05:20.928
Steve is dead.
H.G. Is dead.

05:20.962 --> 05:24.364
I know.
I watched her die.

05:24.398 --> 05:27.667
But every day, people die.

05:27.702 --> 05:29.736
Sometimes it's people
we care about,

05:29.771 --> 05:32.840
and sometimes
it's even people that we love.

05:32.874 --> 05:34.275
We just... we just need
to make sure

05:34.309 --> 05:37.644
that we're not being selfish.

05:37.679 --> 05:39.680
The ytterbium.

05:39.714 --> 05:41.348
The ytterbium chamber.

05:41.383 --> 05:42.950
Artie, what about
the ytterbium chamber?

05:42.984 --> 05:46.654
It's gone.

05:46.688 --> 05:49.390
The what?
What's in there?

05:49.424 --> 05:52.459
- Pandora's box.
- What?

05:52.494 --> 05:55.796
What's that even mean?

05:55.830 --> 05:57.665
No one seems
to be able to pinpoint

05:57.699 --> 06:00.834
exactly why there has been
this sudden and steep decline

06:00.869 --> 06:03.637
across every financial market
that is now open.

06:03.672 --> 06:07.274
The dow has lost 58%
of its value in the last hour.

06:07.309 --> 06:09.810
Currencies across the globe
are crashing

06:09.845 --> 06:12.112
in this stunning
financial meltdown

06:12.147 --> 06:15.049
that experts say
may be the delayed reaction

06:15.083 --> 06:17.585
to the turmoil that has gripped
the world's economies

06:17.619 --> 06:18.886
in recent months.

06:18.920 --> 06:22.323
As a result, rioting and looting
has broken out

06:22.358 --> 06:24.425
in dozens of major cities.

06:24.459 --> 06:25.693
Lester Holt is with us

06:25.727 --> 06:27.595
about an even more
bizarre development.

06:27.629 --> 06:28.596
Lester?

06:28.630 --> 06:29.897
Ed, thanks.

06:29.932 --> 06:32.633
In dozens of major cities
around the world,

06:32.667 --> 06:34.902
this morning's panic
is trending towards spates

06:34.937 --> 06:37.071
of both individual
and group suicides.

06:37.106 --> 06:38.472
Here in New York,

06:38.507 --> 06:42.043
there have been at least 16
separate incidents reported.

06:42.077 --> 06:43.778
Witnesses say in most cases,

06:43.812 --> 06:46.547
an overwhelming depression
gripped the victims,

06:46.581 --> 06:50.051
and ultimately led them
to take their own lives.

06:50.085 --> 06:53.354
Oh, wait, you're saying
that all that

06:53.388 --> 06:55.456
was caused
by the explosion here?

06:55.490 --> 06:58.073
"And in the bottom
of pandora's box,

06:58.193 --> 07:02.130
all that remained
was hope."

07:02.164 --> 07:04.299
So when the warehouse
was destroyed...

07:04.334 --> 07:08.470
The world lost hope.

A New Hope

07:19.951 --> 07:21.918
"Barbosa."
Thoughts?

07:21.953 --> 07:23.887
What else does it say?

07:23.921 --> 07:24.921
I don't know,
I can't see anything else.

07:24.956 --> 07:26.222
Maybe if I had
a microscope, I could...

07:26.257 --> 07:27.590
it's a Portuguese language.

07:27.624 --> 07:29.092
Also a surname.

07:29.126 --> 07:30.393
It's probably the name
of the watchmaker.

07:30.427 --> 07:31.394
Artie, look at that.

07:31.428 --> 07:32.395
- Where?
- There.

07:32.429 --> 07:34.563
<i>"Carregar o Botao."</i>

07:34.598 --> 07:35.898
I don't know what that is.
That's Portuguese

07:35.932 --> 07:39.835
for, uh,
"push the button."

07:39.869 --> 07:43.738
Really? This is still
a surprise to you?

07:43.772 --> 07:45.273
Well, here goes.

07:52.481 --> 07:56.250
- Nobody got vaporized.
- Artie, look.

07:56.284 --> 07:57.751
I see it.
It's turned into a stopwatch.

07:57.786 --> 08:01.355
Let me see.
24-hour stopwatch.

08:01.390 --> 08:03.658
Yeah, but it didn't start
at 24 hours.

08:03.692 --> 08:06.528
It started just over 23 hours.
Why?

08:06.562 --> 08:08.663
Because it started
counting down

08:08.697 --> 08:10.631
the moment the warehouse
was destroyed,

08:10.666 --> 08:11.932
and this is all the time
we have left.

08:11.967 --> 08:13.267
Left till what?

08:13.301 --> 08:15.102
Well, whatever
this fail-safe is,

08:15.136 --> 08:17.604
maybe we have to use it
within the next 23 hours.

08:17.639 --> 08:20.775
And maybe once we find
the fail-safe,

08:20.809 --> 08:22.543
that'll buy us back 24 hours.

08:22.577 --> 08:25.647
Okay, so we have
around 23 hours

08:25.681 --> 08:27.048
to find this...
Whatever the hell it is,

08:27.083 --> 08:28.650
and it's anywhere in the world?

08:28.684 --> 08:30.519
I like beavers.
I'll take Canada.

08:30.553 --> 08:32.254
Artie, look.
The back of the watch,

08:32.289 --> 08:34.524
it... it's loose.

08:34.558 --> 08:40.029
It is loose.

08:40.063 --> 08:42.097
Nothing.
There's nothing.

08:42.131 --> 08:43.299
There's no symbols,
there's no writing.

08:43.333 --> 08:44.968
There should be something.
Black diamonds.

08:45.002 --> 08:46.069
- Where?
- Right there.

08:46.103 --> 08:49.338
Look, usually watchmakers
use... use rubies.

08:49.373 --> 08:51.240
I've never seen anyone
use black diamonds before.

08:51.275 --> 08:52.408
She's right,
it's black diamonds.

08:52.443 --> 08:53.709
What does that mean?

08:53.744 --> 08:56.045
Leena, bring the pump needle.

08:56.080 --> 08:57.213
- Artie, what are you doing?
- Artie?

08:57.248 --> 08:59.382
- Where are you going?
- To the warehouse.

08:59.417 --> 09:01.317
You know it blew up
though, right?

09:10.195 --> 09:11.696
Shouldn't we be trying
to figure out

09:11.731 --> 09:12.864
what the fail-safe does?

09:12.898 --> 09:16.167
That's exactly what I'm doing.

09:16.201 --> 09:18.669
There! Pete!

09:18.704 --> 09:23.174
Oof! Ugh!

09:23.208 --> 09:24.175
Yeah, okay,
all right, all right.

09:24.209 --> 09:26.310
All right, all right.

09:33.417 --> 09:35.218
Oh, I knew that
wasn't regulation weight.

09:35.253 --> 09:39.156
Wait, so... so the football
isn't an artifact?

09:39.190 --> 09:40.390
Uh, it's an artifact tracker.

09:40.424 --> 09:42.559
No, the football
is constantly in the process

09:42.593 --> 09:43.693
of collecting information

09:43.728 --> 09:45.128
on various artifacts
all over the world.

09:45.163 --> 09:47.130
It would normally
download that information

09:47.165 --> 09:48.965
to the warehouse system
as it passes overhead.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.401
Now that we have a clue...
"black diamond"...

09:51.436 --> 09:54.605
the football
is our only resource.

09:54.639 --> 09:56.973
Yeah, well, I've been
through Google, Bing, Altavista,

09:57.008 --> 09:59.376
Yahoo, Hotbot, Galaxy,
Gigablast, Alexa, and Cuil,

09:59.410 --> 10:00.911
and I can't find anything
on black diamonds

10:00.945 --> 10:02.779
unless you're looking for
jewelry, ski gear, or tattoos.

10:02.813 --> 10:06.016
Internet is a distant second
to the football.

10:07.585 --> 10:10.487
<i>"In hoc signo vinces."</i>

10:10.522 --> 10:11.955
"By this sign,
we conquer."

10:11.990 --> 10:13.223
It's a templar motto.

10:13.257 --> 10:15.124
I hate running into
the knights of the templar.

10:15.159 --> 10:17.694
They're always so intense,
and they're overly devoted

10:17.728 --> 10:19.629
to whatever kooky task
they've been given.

10:19.663 --> 10:21.731
Yeah, that would be annoying.

10:23.801 --> 10:26.002
"Richerenches."
That's in the South of France.

10:26.036 --> 10:28.004
There was an underground sect
in Richerenches.

10:28.038 --> 10:30.206
16th century, I think.

10:30.240 --> 10:31.373
And it was descended
of the templars.

10:31.407 --> 10:32.941
Very dangerous.
I got it.

10:32.975 --> 10:35.640
"The brotherhood of the knights
of the black diamond."

10:35.674 --> 10:37.506
The Internet knows everything.

10:37.540 --> 10:38.974
Okay.

10:39.008 --> 10:40.775
Looks like we're off
to France to find a...

10:40.809 --> 10:41.843
we still don't know what,
do we?

10:41.877 --> 10:43.310
We'll know it when we find it.

10:43.344 --> 10:44.678
Leena, you've got
to talk to Mr. Keeler.

10:44.712 --> 10:45.912
Uh, Keeler.

10:45.946 --> 10:47.679
That... that was the regent
from the grocery store.

10:47.714 --> 10:49.213
The one who led us
into the vault, right?

10:49.247 --> 10:50.679
Yes, he's also got
a master's in history

10:50.714 --> 10:53.009
from usd-rapid city,
and he's got access

10:53.045 --> 10:55.141
to a private
regents library there.

10:55.175 --> 10:57.006
And you are gonna need him
to do the research.

10:57.037 --> 10:58.004
What am I researching?

10:58.034 --> 10:59.598
A plan, right?
I mean, if...

10:59.632 --> 11:01.055
if we're gonna
somehow get the day back,

11:01.090 --> 11:02.389
we're gonna need
a plan to stop the bomb.

11:02.423 --> 11:03.855
Precisely.

11:03.890 --> 11:05.921
Leena, you're gonna have to
research and locate an artifact

11:05.956 --> 11:08.386
that was in warehouse 13,
and if we can erase 24 hours,

11:08.420 --> 11:11.586
an artifact that we can use
to diffuse Sykes's bomb.

11:11.620 --> 11:15.484
How hard could that be?

11:18.016 --> 11:19.882
- Good game.
- Thank you.

11:19.916 --> 11:23.113
Precisely 22 hours
and 18 minutes

11:23.147 --> 11:25.072
to get to Richerenches,
find the artifact,

11:25.107 --> 11:27.424
figure out what it does,
and go back far enough

11:27.459 --> 11:29.373
to stop the warehouse
from being destroyed.

11:29.408 --> 11:31.689
Great, what could possibly
go wrong?

11:31.723 --> 11:34.900
I'm not going.

11:34.928 --> 11:36.322
What?

11:36.357 --> 11:38.111
But, Claudia...

11:38.146 --> 11:39.965
It's too late already,
isn't it?

11:40.000 --> 11:41.852
We're never gonna
get there in time.

11:41.886 --> 11:43.078
In time for what?

11:43.112 --> 11:45.067
What... we... we've
got to try.

11:45.101 --> 11:47.557
In time to go back
far enough to save Steve.

11:47.591 --> 11:50.574
No, I'm taking the metronome.
I'm bringing him back.

11:50.608 --> 11:54.186
Claudia. Claudia!

11:54.221 --> 11:55.381
Bring him back to what?

11:55.416 --> 11:57.705
A world without hope?
Okay, look, I get it.

11:57.739 --> 11:59.395
I do.
We... we all do.

11:59.429 --> 12:01.484
We've all lost someone
we care about.

12:01.518 --> 12:04.345
And if you live long enough,
it happens over and over again.

12:04.465 --> 12:06.722
Listen, Claude.

12:06.756 --> 12:08.813
We need everything
that we got right now.

12:08.847 --> 12:13.156
We need you.

12:19.129 --> 12:23.542
Okay.

12:23.577 --> 12:25.800
Don't think this is over.

12:25.834 --> 12:28.048
I will remember
what I have to do,

12:28.168 --> 12:30.509
and nothing will stop me
from doing it.

12:49.281 --> 12:50.983
10 hours, 28 minutes left.

12:51.017 --> 12:53.185
Why are there signs
for truffles everywhere?

12:53.219 --> 12:55.087
Black perigold truffles,
to be precise.

12:55.122 --> 12:56.523
They're also known
as black diamonds.

12:56.558 --> 12:57.926
The public face
of the brotherhood

12:57.961 --> 13:00.298
is that they collect and auction
the truffles for the church.

13:00.332 --> 13:01.732
Not a lot of other info
exists on them.

13:01.767 --> 13:03.400
Well, they're an intensely
secretive sect.

13:03.435 --> 13:04.635
Oh, why is it so cold
in the middle of summer?

13:04.669 --> 13:06.570
It's not actually cold.

13:06.604 --> 13:07.971
Are you kidding me?
It's freezing.

13:08.005 --> 13:10.040
It's a physical manifestation
of the loss of hope.

13:10.074 --> 13:12.442
Our minds are starting
to interpret weather and music,

13:12.476 --> 13:15.478
sounds, colors
in a duller, darker context.

13:15.512 --> 13:17.247
Our brains are producing
far fewer endorphins.

13:17.281 --> 13:19.849
That explains why Pete didn't
hit on that flight attendant.

13:19.883 --> 13:21.918
I know, right?
That's not like me.

13:21.952 --> 13:23.253
We can control the loss of hope

13:23.287 --> 13:25.155
if we dig into other emotions,
focusing on those.

13:25.189 --> 13:27.891
I'm using anger.
It's working rather well.

13:27.925 --> 13:30.059
Artie, there's the commandry.

13:30.094 --> 13:32.062
- It's been converted.
- Wait. "Barbosa."

13:32.096 --> 13:33.396
Isn't that the name
of the watch company?

13:33.431 --> 13:35.498
Yeah.
Let's get that cab.

13:35.533 --> 13:37.867
Ah, ah, ah.
I'm assuming the rest of you

13:37.902 --> 13:40.203
have noticed the two guys
following us?

13:40.237 --> 13:42.205
Yeah, since the station.

13:42.239 --> 13:43.873
They're not doing
a very good job hiding it.

13:43.907 --> 13:46.175
It's the brotherhood's turf.
They don't have to hide it.

13:46.210 --> 13:48.277
Well, they could've
at least made it challenging.

13:48.312 --> 13:49.745
You know,
professional courtesy?

13:49.780 --> 13:52.615
Hi, guys!
Pete.

13:52.650 --> 13:54.584
- Okay, who's got francs?
- Euros.

13:54.618 --> 13:57.887
<i>Bonjour.
Okay, Allonsy.</i>

14:03.794 --> 14:05.928
Okay, fill us in.
The percussive force

14:05.962 --> 14:07.430
of the house of commons masonry
was fueled

14:07.464 --> 14:08.531
by the Nazi regime's hate.

14:08.565 --> 14:10.399
That's why it was so powerful.

14:10.434 --> 14:12.235
More than any war in history,

14:12.269 --> 14:15.104
Hitler's campaign was driven
by pure, violent hate.

14:15.138 --> 14:17.206
We're thinking an artifact
of pure peace

14:17.240 --> 14:19.141
might counteract it.
That sounds reasonable.

14:19.175 --> 14:20.676
Any ideas?

14:20.710 --> 14:22.911
Uh, something that
sergeant shriver owned?

14:22.945 --> 14:24.779
He was the first director
of the peace corps.

14:24.814 --> 14:26.214
Yeah, or the first
peace treaty ever signed.

14:26.248 --> 14:29.216
We must have that.
A peacekeeping missile.

14:29.251 --> 14:31.151
And that's why
this is not my department.

14:31.186 --> 14:33.821
- We'll find something, Artie.
- All right, good.

14:33.855 --> 14:35.689
I assume your alien mother ship

14:35.723 --> 14:38.525
will be taking you back home?

14:58.214 --> 15:02.651
Okay, is that enough
of a challenge for you?

15:02.685 --> 15:05.921
Yes, much better, thank you.

15:05.955 --> 15:10.292
Artie, look at that door
behind them.

15:12.996 --> 15:16.698
Carbonado is the mineral name
for black diamonds.

15:16.733 --> 15:19.568
<i>Andprivemeans that's
probably where we need to go.</i>

15:19.603 --> 15:21.403
All right, Myka and I
will distract the brotherhood.

15:21.438 --> 15:23.138
You guys go find
the magic doohickey.

15:23.173 --> 15:24.606
It's not a doohickey,
it's a fail-safe.

15:24.641 --> 15:25.908
Whatever, as long
as it's magic.

15:25.942 --> 15:28.043
Be careful, because those guys
will not think twice

15:28.078 --> 15:29.278
about killing you.

15:29.312 --> 15:31.179
Okay, so what's the plan?

15:31.214 --> 15:33.114
Plan?
No, that's all I had.

15:33.149 --> 15:34.282
You usually have all the plans.

15:34.316 --> 15:36.985
- What?
- Kidding. Watch this.

15:42.424 --> 15:45.292
Oh, guys, hey!
How are you?

15:45.326 --> 15:47.794
Hey, listen, I'm thinking
you guys can help me.

15:47.829 --> 15:51.397
I'm looking for
ye olde truffle shoppe.

15:51.432 --> 15:55.401
Anything? It's in my, uh...
my "go France" guide,

15:55.435 --> 15:56.969
and I promised the missus
I'd get her some

15:57.004 --> 15:58.938
of those 'shrooms she loves.

15:58.972 --> 16:00.373
Oh, there she is!
Come on out.

16:00.407 --> 16:02.642
No, come on out, honey.
Huh?

16:02.676 --> 16:04.410
Huh?
Look at that figure.

16:04.444 --> 16:06.512
Uh, she likes to put the...
you know, the 'shrooms

16:06.547 --> 16:07.513
in her salad.

16:07.548 --> 16:09.215
She's a bit of a health nut,

16:09.250 --> 16:11.951
which apparently
you can understand.

16:11.986 --> 16:13.720
Can't you, big guy?
Whoo!

16:13.754 --> 16:15.488
Oh, man, you're big.

16:15.523 --> 16:19.193
Oh, my God, you're...
not gay, but open-minded.

16:20.695 --> 16:24.499
Really, that was the plan?
Hit the big one?

16:30.407 --> 16:32.541
All right, we're here.

16:32.576 --> 16:33.909
Any idea what
we're looking for yet?

16:33.944 --> 16:35.211
We're looking
for anything out of place.

16:35.245 --> 16:37.179
If they hid
an artifact in here,

16:37.213 --> 16:40.482
they'd need some kind of clue
or a map to find it again.

16:40.517 --> 16:42.451
This is nuts.
Is it bigger than a baguette?

16:42.485 --> 16:44.420
Is it an antique corkscrew?
Napoleon's original pastry?

16:44.454 --> 16:45.421
I mean, it could be anything.

16:45.455 --> 16:47.256
Uh... Wait a minute.

16:47.291 --> 16:49.358
Look at this.

16:49.392 --> 16:50.926
Claudia...

16:50.961 --> 16:54.364
You see the difference
between that and that?

16:54.398 --> 16:57.000
Yeah, these barrels have space
between them and the wall.

16:57.035 --> 16:58.769
This is right up against it.
Sneaky, sneaky.

16:58.803 --> 17:00.237
Yeah.

17:00.272 --> 17:02.373
So there's something
about these barrels that...

17:05.211 --> 17:06.377
Something about
these barrels...

17:11.818 --> 17:14.352
Ha!

17:14.387 --> 17:17.922
Ha ha! Yes!
There is a track under here.

17:17.957 --> 17:19.924
Oh!
Okay, all right, nice.

17:19.958 --> 17:22.259
You found a track.
And I broke my back.

17:22.292 --> 17:24.060
I think it's l4.
No, l5.

17:24.095 --> 17:25.462
You know what?
Pull my elbows down.

17:25.496 --> 17:27.696
Put your knee right...
Yeah, that's gonna happen.

17:27.732 --> 17:29.599
Help me pull these forward.

17:29.634 --> 17:30.767
All right.

17:34.671 --> 17:35.938
Harder, harder, come on,
pull harder.

17:35.973 --> 17:38.274
I am pulling.
Did I mention I broke my back?

17:38.309 --> 17:40.743
Argh!
Just pull, grandma!

17:40.778 --> 17:43.647
Aah! No!

17:43.681 --> 17:45.382
Maybe it's something else.

17:45.416 --> 17:47.651
No, never give up,
never surrender.

17:47.686 --> 17:51.388
Just give me a second.
Let me look at this.

17:51.422 --> 17:54.358
Okay, six barrels,
same label, same trim pieces.

17:54.392 --> 17:56.259
Same... oh!
It's so obvious.

17:56.294 --> 17:59.730
That's better.

18:06.237 --> 18:07.204
- Huh?
- Yeah.

18:07.238 --> 18:09.673
- Again.
- Okay.

18:11.876 --> 18:13.943
Oh, yeah, I'm lifting.

18:18.383 --> 18:19.884
Still an expert
at breaking and entering.

18:19.918 --> 18:22.019
It's like stealing a bicycle.

18:22.054 --> 18:23.922
All right.

18:23.956 --> 18:27.025
And how are you
at breaking through walls?

18:27.059 --> 18:28.793
Well, we'll find out, won't we?

18:28.828 --> 18:32.063
Hope Pete and Myka are okay.

18:43.976 --> 18:46.478
Hey, pooh bear,
you want to let me do that?

18:46.512 --> 18:49.614
Now do you see
why it was important

18:49.649 --> 18:51.049
that you came along?
Yeah.

18:51.084 --> 18:52.484
I can just picture you
trying to get through here.

18:52.518 --> 18:53.585
"Oh, help and bother!
I'm stuck!"

18:53.620 --> 18:54.786
All right, all right.

18:54.821 --> 18:56.655
- "I'm so rumbly in my tumbly."
- Stop it.

18:56.689 --> 18:59.858
- Silly old bear.
- Enough.

18:59.892 --> 19:01.760
What do you see?

19:01.794 --> 19:02.761
Claudia.

19:02.795 --> 19:05.697
Claudia, can you hear me?

19:05.732 --> 19:08.834
Claud... Claudia?

19:08.868 --> 19:10.168
You all right?
I'm fine.

19:10.203 --> 19:14.473
I think I found something.

19:14.508 --> 19:15.674
I found something, right?

19:15.709 --> 19:18.444
Dear God.

19:18.478 --> 19:21.681
This is an astrolabe.

19:21.715 --> 19:24.750
And if I'm...
Reading this right,

19:24.785 --> 19:28.454
it belonged
to ferdinand Magellan.

19:28.489 --> 19:33.861
That must be what this "m"
on the watch is for.

19:33.895 --> 19:35.195
That's why
it's a 24-hour stopwatch.

19:35.230 --> 19:36.296
Because Magellan
was the first guy

19:36.331 --> 19:37.564
to sail all the way
around the world.

19:37.599 --> 19:39.266
So you actually
paid attention in fifth grade?

19:39.301 --> 19:40.702
Yes, now think back
to your youth,

19:40.736 --> 19:42.203
and try to remember
what he said to you on deck

19:42.238 --> 19:43.805
the night he crossed
the international date line.

19:43.839 --> 19:46.141
I never tire of those comments.

19:46.175 --> 19:48.110
If this is
the fail-safe,

19:48.144 --> 19:49.845
then it must've been imbued
with something.

19:49.880 --> 19:55.318
Something that
lets it erase 24 hours, but...

19:55.353 --> 19:57.888
- But what?
- The alidade...

19:57.922 --> 20:01.392
eyepiece that affixes
to the center... it's missing.

20:01.426 --> 20:03.961
It's what... it's what
the sailors used

20:03.995 --> 20:06.129
to look through
to get their bearings.

20:06.164 --> 20:07.798
Okay, it must still be in here.

20:07.832 --> 20:10.234
It's not very deep,
only about 12 feet back

20:10.268 --> 20:13.704
before it dead ends
into solid rock.

20:13.738 --> 20:16.673
Uh, it's just
a straight piece of brass,

20:16.708 --> 20:20.076
pointed slightly on each end.
Uh, please.

20:20.111 --> 20:23.479
Who doesn't know
what an alidade looks like?

20:23.513 --> 20:25.581
Uh, there's nothing
back here, Artie.

20:25.615 --> 20:27.082
Absolutely nothing.
Maybe it's...

20:27.117 --> 20:30.085
that belongs to us.

20:32.722 --> 20:34.690
You don't understand.

20:34.724 --> 20:36.292
The world has lost hope.
No, my friend.

20:36.326 --> 20:39.228
It's you who doesn't
understand.

20:39.263 --> 20:41.664
I can't let you
take the astrolabe.

20:41.699 --> 20:43.466
Put it back.
No, no.

20:43.501 --> 20:45.968
Listen to me.
Put it back.

20:46.003 --> 20:47.369
Now.

20:47.404 --> 20:49.305
I won't ask you again.

20:53.042 --> 20:56.845
Claudia, get back!

20:56.879 --> 20:58.947
- Aah!
- No!

21:04.353 --> 21:06.321
Claudia!

21:16.039 --> 21:17.506
Any luck out there, Pete?

21:17.541 --> 21:19.142
Look, there's no use trying
to get in this way.

21:19.176 --> 21:21.177
It's not just a cave-in,
it's a trap.

21:21.211 --> 21:22.545
We'll never get past
the iron gate.

21:22.579 --> 21:23.980
Got to be a release switch
or something

21:24.014 --> 21:25.515
to get her out of there.
All right, Claudia,

21:25.549 --> 21:27.517
can you see another way out?
No.

21:27.551 --> 21:29.686
My legs are trapped
under the dirt anyway.

21:29.720 --> 21:31.520
I can't move.
I should've seen this.

21:31.555 --> 21:33.489
It was so damn obvious.
What the hell was I doing?

21:33.524 --> 21:35.725
You were getting
Magellan's astrolabe, Artie.

21:35.760 --> 21:38.161
I only got half of it.
And at what price?

21:38.196 --> 21:40.130
We're already seeing
the downside of this thing

21:40.164 --> 21:43.133
before we get any
of the benefits from it.

21:43.168 --> 21:45.135
Artie, hey.
We're gonna get her out.

21:45.170 --> 21:48.204
There's always a way, all right?
Yeah.

21:48.239 --> 21:50.807
Don't lose hope, guys.
Just find the other part.

21:50.841 --> 21:51.974
If you can make it work,

21:52.009 --> 21:53.476
I won't ever
have gone in here, right?

21:53.510 --> 21:56.645
She's right, we have to stay
focused on the big picture.

21:56.679 --> 21:59.347
We have to erase
the last 24 hours.

21:59.382 --> 22:00.649
Yeah, but where's
the other part?

22:00.683 --> 22:02.083
The alidade.

22:02.118 --> 22:03.218
It wasn't with the disc.

22:03.252 --> 22:04.252
I don't know,
it could be anywhere.

22:04.286 --> 22:05.419
It could be anywhere
in the world.

22:05.454 --> 22:06.520
The watch.
The writing on the watch

22:06.555 --> 22:07.755
was Portuguese, right?

22:07.789 --> 22:10.791
Magellan was Portuguese.
Barbosa was Portuguese.

22:10.826 --> 22:14.162
Duarte Barbosa, he was
the captain of Magellan's ship.

22:14.196 --> 22:16.330
<i>Victoria.</i>

22:16.365 --> 22:17.899
Well, don't look at me.

22:17.933 --> 22:19.734
I was probably
at wrestling practice.

22:19.768 --> 22:21.535
All right, maybe there's
something on this watch.

22:21.569 --> 22:23.437
Something to connect it
to this astrolabe

22:23.471 --> 22:25.272
so it'll tell us something.

22:25.307 --> 22:27.709
Artie, look.

22:27.743 --> 22:29.945
I know.
It's a watch again.

22:29.979 --> 22:32.014
Yeah, but that's
the wrong time.

22:32.048 --> 22:36.452
4:18? 4:18?
What's the significance of that?

22:36.486 --> 22:37.753
Could be longitude/latitude.

22:37.788 --> 22:41.858
4 north/18 east is literally
the middle of the jungle

22:41.892 --> 22:43.460
in the central
African Republic.

22:43.494 --> 22:46.430
4 south/18 east
is middle of Congo.

22:46.464 --> 22:48.965
We couldn't get
to either place in time anyway.

22:49.000 --> 22:52.369
4 north/18 west,
middle of the Atlantic.

22:52.403 --> 22:53.737
4 south/18 west, ditto.

22:53.771 --> 22:56.272
April 18th?

22:56.307 --> 22:57.507
1775. Paul revere's ride.

22:57.541 --> 22:58.875
I don't even have to
look that one up.

22:58.910 --> 23:01.912
Uh, 1881, Billy the kid
escaped from Lincoln county jail

23:01.947 --> 23:04.548
in new Mexico.
1906.

23:04.582 --> 23:06.182
San Francisco earthquake.
1923.

23:06.217 --> 23:07.817
Yankee stadium opened.
1930.

23:07.852 --> 23:10.653
BBC announces that there's
no news to report that day.

23:10.688 --> 23:12.288
All right,
maybe it's not a date.

23:12.322 --> 23:13.422
Any other options?

23:13.457 --> 23:15.424
Uh, the 418 area code
is quebec.

23:15.459 --> 23:20.162
Uh, the year 418,
nothing happened of consequence.

23:20.196 --> 23:23.565
- What about military time?
16:18, does...

23:23.599 --> 23:24.799
or does that just
complicate things?

23:24.834 --> 23:25.867
I don't know.

23:25.901 --> 23:26.935
No, you know what?
Never mind.

23:26.969 --> 23:29.137
No, wait, 16:18.
Chapter and verse!

23:29.171 --> 23:31.039
- Chapter and verse!
- You guys sound excited.

23:31.074 --> 23:32.207
Did I solve it?

23:32.241 --> 23:33.608
What if the "m"
doesn't stand for...

23:33.643 --> 23:34.876
it doesn't stand for
"Magellan," it stands for...

23:34.911 --> 23:35.944
A book
in the Bible!

23:35.979 --> 23:37.979
- Leena!
- I'm looking them up right now.

23:38.014 --> 23:39.414
The only "m" s
in the old testament

23:39.448 --> 23:41.783
are Micah and malachi, and they
don't have a 16th chapter.

23:41.818 --> 23:45.821
In the new testament,
it'd be mark or Matthew.

23:45.855 --> 23:48.657
They made us read the Bible
a lot in the psych hospital.

23:48.691 --> 23:50.325
I think it's how
they kept their funding.

23:50.360 --> 23:53.930
Mark 16:18: "They shall
take up serpents..."

23:53.964 --> 23:56.666
And if they drink any deadly
thing, it shall not hurt them."

23:56.701 --> 23:59.203
Man, I-I really hope we don't
have to drink snake poison

23:59.237 --> 24:01.238
to find this thing.
I mean, I'll do it...

24:01.272 --> 24:02.773
But I'm really hoping
we don't have to.

24:02.808 --> 24:05.009
Artie, Artie!

24:05.044 --> 24:08.713
Matthew 16:18: "And I
tell you, you are Peter..."

24:08.747 --> 24:10.682
"And on this rock
I will build my church...

24:10.716 --> 24:13.618
And the gates of hell
shall not prevail against it."

24:13.653 --> 24:15.220
- Peter.
- "On this rock."

24:15.254 --> 24:16.287
- The Vatican.
- The Vatican.

24:16.322 --> 24:17.688
The alidade is at the Vatican.

24:17.723 --> 24:18.923
Listen to this:

24:18.958 --> 24:21.326
The cornerstone
of St. Peter's basilica

24:21.360 --> 24:24.262
was laid in 1506, April 18th.

24:24.296 --> 24:25.630
Even I know that's where it is.

24:25.664 --> 24:28.533
All right, you two keep
looking for the peace artifact.

24:28.568 --> 24:30.802
Don't worry,
we'll find something.

24:30.837 --> 24:32.704
- Bye.
- And Artie, Artie, Artie...

24:32.739 --> 24:34.006
Look, the watch
is counting down again.

24:34.040 --> 24:35.474
What?

24:35.509 --> 24:38.177
All right, we've got exactly
8 hours and 57 minutes

24:38.211 --> 24:39.612
to get to Rome,
break into the Vatican,

24:39.646 --> 24:41.981
get down to St. Peter's tomb,
find the alidade.

24:42.015 --> 24:45.518
All right, well, let's go.

24:45.553 --> 24:48.822
Huh?

24:51.292 --> 24:52.659
I'll stay.

24:52.694 --> 24:54.695
Oh, Mykes, I'll... I'll...
I'll stay.

24:54.730 --> 24:56.898
Hey, are you guys still there?

24:56.933 --> 24:58.667
- Yeah, Claude, don't worry...
- Why?

24:58.701 --> 25:00.402
Get the hell out of here.

25:00.436 --> 25:02.204
Forget about me, just go
get the thing and make it work.

25:02.239 --> 25:05.174
Now. Go now.
You should be gone already.

25:05.208 --> 25:07.042
- Okay, Claude.
- We'll get it, I promise.

25:07.076 --> 25:11.113
Or we'll be back.

25:39.309 --> 25:41.077
- Hey, hey, hey!
- No, no, no, no, Pete!

25:41.111 --> 25:43.913
No, no, no, no!
We've got no time.

25:43.948 --> 25:45.648
We've got less
than two hours left.

25:45.683 --> 25:46.883
Artie, it's getting worse,
isn't it?

25:46.917 --> 25:48.885
Yes, yes,
because when there's no hope,

25:48.920 --> 25:52.422
then people turn to fear
and chaos takes over.

25:56.495 --> 25:59.197
Okay, this...
this is the restaurant.

25:59.231 --> 26:00.965
- Man, I'm starving.
- Really? Now?

26:00.999 --> 26:02.634
We are not here to eat.

26:02.668 --> 26:04.936
An army travels on its stomach.

26:26.156 --> 26:27.156
Alberto!

26:27.191 --> 26:30.093
Alberto, no, no, no, no, no.

26:35.766 --> 26:37.199
Ooh!

26:37.234 --> 26:38.534
Okay, what are we even
doing here?

26:38.568 --> 26:40.269
Shouldn't we be
breaking into St. Peter's?

26:40.304 --> 26:41.971
No, no, no, in the basement
of Giancarlo's,

26:42.005 --> 26:43.806
there is an old tunnel
that leads directly

26:43.841 --> 26:45.342
into the bowels
of the basilica.

26:45.376 --> 26:47.110
People used to break
into the Vatican?

26:47.144 --> 26:48.144
Back when the tunnel was built,

26:48.179 --> 26:49.946
they more often
used it to sneak out.

26:49.981 --> 26:51.414
All right, so how
do we get past brunhilda?

26:51.449 --> 26:53.784
- Exactly.
- You guys stay here.

26:53.818 --> 26:55.352
Whatwhat...
what are you gonna do?

26:55.387 --> 26:57.288
We're running out of time
and options, okay?

26:57.322 --> 26:59.123
So just get ready
to find your tunnel.

26:59.157 --> 27:00.658
Oh, man, I've seen
that look before.

27:00.692 --> 27:03.294
Just get your head down.

27:08.867 --> 27:11.536
<i>- Oh, dio!
- Arrivederci!</i>

27:12.872 --> 27:15.607
- Go!
- What? Wait.

27:22.115 --> 27:24.717
- Come on, let's go.
- Artie, she's in trouble.

27:24.751 --> 27:26.686
Go.

27:26.720 --> 27:29.021
Okay, it's now or never.

27:29.055 --> 27:30.022
Come on.

27:30.056 --> 27:31.523
I got her.

27:31.558 --> 27:34.526
All right, all right.

27:36.562 --> 27:40.898
St. Peter's tomb is another
level directly below us.

27:40.933 --> 27:43.801
The church has had it sealed off
for over a hundred years,

27:43.836 --> 27:49.040
but, you know, if I remember,
there is an elevator system.

27:49.074 --> 27:52.676
And, okay, this is...

27:52.711 --> 27:55.279
oh, God, 30 minutes left.

27:55.313 --> 27:59.750
Artie, I'm getting
some major vibe-age here.

27:59.784 --> 28:00.851
Good or bad?

28:00.885 --> 28:03.653
I don't know.
Both. It's weird.

28:03.688 --> 28:05.255
Good and then...

28:05.289 --> 28:09.359
Something... something
really dark.

28:09.393 --> 28:12.128
Wait. Ah.
Look at that.

28:12.162 --> 28:14.563
Looks like an elevator to me.

28:14.598 --> 28:17.366
But how do we...

28:17.400 --> 28:19.000
Wires.

28:23.139 --> 28:24.739
We need Claudia.

28:24.774 --> 28:28.543
No, no, the old dog's
still got a few tricks.

28:33.014 --> 28:34.548
Ow!

28:36.185 --> 28:38.953
Looks like it singed your fur
a little bit there, scrappy.

28:38.987 --> 28:44.226
Yeah, yeah, that didn't do it.

28:46.996 --> 28:48.930
Bingo.

28:48.965 --> 28:51.733
And that's how you get down
to St. Peter's tomb.

28:51.768 --> 28:54.603
What?
Vibe, Artie.

28:54.637 --> 28:58.607
A big one. I don't know.
There's something.

28:58.641 --> 29:01.743
Oh, my God.
The alidade.

29:01.777 --> 29:04.413
Look in the mirror.
The dial.

29:04.447 --> 29:06.949
It's right here.

29:10.620 --> 29:12.921
Oh, great.

29:12.955 --> 29:16.325
You guys again.

29:16.359 --> 29:18.027
Hyah!

29:27.303 --> 29:28.603
Yeah-uh!

29:28.637 --> 29:32.373
My partner taught me that one.

29:32.408 --> 29:33.474
Behind you!

29:56.064 --> 30:00.802
Pete.

30:00.836 --> 30:04.172
I got it, Artie.

30:07.677 --> 30:09.578
I got it.

30:13.650 --> 30:14.884
Oh, my God.

30:14.919 --> 30:17.820
Should've seen the other guy.

30:17.855 --> 30:20.023
Oh!

30:22.426 --> 30:25.528
I think he got...

30:25.563 --> 30:27.597
I think he got me good, Artie.

30:27.631 --> 30:29.432
It didn't hurt at first, but...

30:29.466 --> 30:32.102
Now it kind of does.

30:32.136 --> 30:34.004
It hurts bad.

30:34.038 --> 30:35.872
It really, really hurts, Artie.
Yeah.

30:35.907 --> 30:37.407
Don't you... don't...
don't talk.

30:37.442 --> 30:39.142
I just got to stop
this bleeding.

30:39.176 --> 30:41.211
But that was it, right?
That was what...

30:41.245 --> 30:44.848
that's what you needed?

30:44.882 --> 30:47.450
We...
We got it?

30:47.484 --> 30:50.253
Yes, Pete, okay.
You got it.

30:50.287 --> 30:53.455
You got it, you got it.

30:53.490 --> 30:55.457
Yeah.

30:55.491 --> 30:59.794
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.

30:59.829 --> 31:02.530
It's gonna be okay, okay.

31:02.565 --> 31:06.234
It's gonna be okay, right?
Mmhmm.

31:06.268 --> 31:09.738
I'm not gonna remember?

31:09.772 --> 31:12.807
Remember what?

31:12.842 --> 31:16.445
Remember dying.

31:16.479 --> 31:21.717
No. No, Pete.

31:21.751 --> 31:24.253
You won't remember.

31:33.564 --> 31:37.634
But I will.

31:37.668 --> 31:40.437
I will.

32:03.968 --> 32:06.770
- Artie, what's wrong?
- Pete.

32:06.804 --> 32:10.007
He... he...

32:10.041 --> 32:13.109
he, uh, found the alidade.

32:13.144 --> 32:14.811
So we're good to go.

32:14.845 --> 32:16.946
But we're out of time,
so please tell me

32:16.981 --> 32:19.082
you've got something
to counteract the bomb.

32:19.116 --> 32:20.984
Gandhi's dhoti.

32:21.018 --> 32:23.486
The homespun cloth of cotton
that the mahatma wore

32:23.520 --> 32:24.988
during his fast
for non-violence.

32:25.023 --> 32:26.689
I've seen it in the inventory.

32:26.724 --> 32:27.991
It was snagged
after he was assassinated.

32:28.025 --> 32:30.360
They say it emanates
pure peace.

32:30.394 --> 32:32.663
We think it's your best bet.
All right.

32:32.697 --> 32:35.533
Wish me...

32:35.567 --> 32:38.569
wish us luck.

32:44.410 --> 32:48.479
Why?

32:48.514 --> 32:51.182
Oh, my God.

32:51.217 --> 32:55.220
Please...
Tell me why.

32:55.254 --> 32:56.221
I can't.

32:56.255 --> 32:59.390
I'm so sorry.

32:59.425 --> 33:02.427
Something's happened.
Something...

33:02.461 --> 33:05.163
something irrevocable?

33:05.197 --> 33:09.334
I believe I can fix it.
I know I can.

33:09.369 --> 33:12.237
If you do this,
you can tell no one.

33:12.272 --> 33:16.075
Anyone you tell...

33:16.109 --> 33:18.878
Of your actions
will be in grave danger.

33:18.912 --> 33:22.883
All right.

33:22.917 --> 33:24.518
If you use the astrolabe,

33:24.552 --> 33:29.591
you will create an evil
of your own making.

33:29.625 --> 33:34.630
An evil that will live
with you the rest of your days.

34:22.176 --> 34:23.243
Artie, thank God.

34:23.277 --> 34:26.079
Yes, that was getting
rather close.

34:26.114 --> 34:28.081
- Uh...
- Okay, listen.

34:28.116 --> 34:29.815
We have to find Sykes, right?

34:29.850 --> 34:31.784
He's probably...
what... Artie, what's wrong?

34:31.819 --> 34:32.786
- Are you all right?
- What?

34:32.820 --> 34:35.355
Yeah, I'm... I'm good.

34:35.389 --> 34:39.125
Right, you were tied up,
and now you're free.

34:39.159 --> 34:40.126
Artie, what is wrong?

34:40.159 --> 34:41.127
Nothing.

34:41.161 --> 34:43.129
Right, uh, yeah.

34:43.163 --> 34:44.730
Then there's a bomb
in Sykes's wheelchair.

34:44.764 --> 34:45.964
What?

34:45.998 --> 34:47.533
There's a bomb
in Sykes's wheelchair!

34:47.567 --> 34:49.301
Why would he have a bomb...

34:49.335 --> 34:51.203
because he wants
to destroy the warehouse.

34:51.237 --> 34:52.304
He wants to blow it up.

34:52.338 --> 34:53.672
Yes, yes,
that makes perfect sense.

34:53.706 --> 34:55.774
This is what he's
been waiting decades to...

34:55.808 --> 34:57.509
how did you know about that?

34:57.543 --> 34:59.110
We have to go
to aisle Rajghat 1948.

34:59.144 --> 35:00.311
We have to do that right now.

35:00.345 --> 35:01.746
Why do you always do that?

35:01.780 --> 35:03.514
Artie!
Artie!

35:03.549 --> 35:06.250
This is masonry from the British
house of commons.

35:06.284 --> 35:07.818
Yeah, it was infused
with all the hatred

35:07.852 --> 35:09.453
of the Nazi regime
during the blitzkrieg.

35:09.487 --> 35:11.121
Now where is it?

35:11.156 --> 35:13.556
Are you sure we even have
Gandhi's dhoti? I mean...

35:15.292 --> 35:16.760
and there's the sandals.
There's the glasses.

35:16.794 --> 35:18.462
Where's the damn...
Dhoti! Got it.

35:18.496 --> 35:19.764
But, Artie,
how did you even know

35:19.798 --> 35:20.765
about the bomb
being in the wheelchair?

35:20.799 --> 35:21.900
It was logical, and, uh,

35:21.934 --> 35:23.635
I think he may have
mentioned it in passing.

35:23.669 --> 35:25.370
And how did you know
about Gandhi's...

35:25.405 --> 35:26.471
it doesn't matter.

35:27.507 --> 35:30.409
Oh!

35:40.454 --> 35:41.888
It's still counting down.

35:41.922 --> 35:44.090
No, it can't be.
It's supposed to stop.

35:44.124 --> 35:45.358
Myka, if we don't do something,

35:45.392 --> 35:46.626
this thing is gonna
destroy the whole warehouse.

35:46.660 --> 35:48.027
Hey, don't panic, all right?

35:48.061 --> 35:51.063
You... you said that the bomb
was fueled by hatred, right?

35:51.097 --> 35:52.565
Yeah, well, we thought

35:52.599 --> 35:54.633
that the pure peace
of Gandhi's dhoti

35:54.668 --> 35:56.235
would counteract
Hitler's pure hatred.

35:56.269 --> 35:58.604
- It's not the bomb.
- What?

35:58.638 --> 36:00.005
It's not the bomb.

36:00.040 --> 36:02.275
- Of course. The hatred.
- Right.

36:02.309 --> 36:04.377
So if hatred is
what ignites the bomb,

36:04.411 --> 36:06.779
then we don't need
to diffuse the bomb.

36:06.813 --> 36:08.414
We need to diffuse
Walter Sykes.

36:08.448 --> 36:09.682
Right.

36:09.716 --> 36:12.484
And Pete is about
to push him through the portal,

36:12.519 --> 36:13.953
and he's gonna be lost forever.

36:13.987 --> 36:15.621
Wait!

36:15.655 --> 36:19.224
How do you know these things?

36:19.259 --> 36:20.292
Get away from her!

36:29.403 --> 36:30.636
No, no!
Pete, don't!

36:30.670 --> 36:33.072
No, bring him back.
You have to bring him back.

36:33.106 --> 36:35.307
Bring him back!

36:42.783 --> 36:44.050
Myka.

36:57.799 --> 36:59.934
It stopped.

37:27.294 --> 37:30.529
I'm sorry.

37:30.563 --> 37:34.133
I'm so sorry.

37:39.706 --> 37:41.707
He's gone.

37:52.823 --> 37:54.624
Agent Nielsen,
you have to be m more specific.

37:54.658 --> 37:57.059
How can you be certain
of h.G. Wells's rehabilitation?

37:57.094 --> 37:58.260
I know how all this sounds,

37:58.295 --> 38:00.162
but could you possibly
just trust me on this?

38:00.197 --> 38:01.397
Trust you on this?
That's it?

38:01.431 --> 38:04.467
Look, she did save Myka's life
in Hong Kong,

38:04.501 --> 38:07.069
and the two of them did manage
to reopen the portal,

38:07.103 --> 38:08.537
which ultimately saved us all.

38:08.572 --> 38:10.139
What h.G. Did
was admirable,

38:10.174 --> 38:12.141
but one event
doesn't change history.

38:12.176 --> 38:14.410
You cannot have the regents
simply ignore the past.

38:14.444 --> 38:17.346
Why not? The past isn't
written in stone, you know.

38:17.381 --> 38:19.783
Well, I mean, you know,
it's... it's written in...

38:19.817 --> 38:22.018
you... you know
what I mean.

38:22.053 --> 38:23.687
No.

38:23.721 --> 38:26.323
Actually we don't, Arthur.
What are you talking about?

38:26.357 --> 38:29.459
II mean, people change.

38:29.493 --> 38:32.195
They learn.
They grow.

38:32.230 --> 38:35.165
She had any number
of opportunities to bury us.

38:35.199 --> 38:36.833
She didn't.

38:36.867 --> 38:40.003
I think under
an extreme circumstance,

38:40.037 --> 38:42.839
I can see miss Wells
behaving quite...

38:42.874 --> 38:43.840
Heroically.

38:43.875 --> 38:46.944
I mean, if it came to it.

38:46.978 --> 38:50.680
This is a sudden and
miraculous change of opinion.

38:50.715 --> 38:51.948
It's quite unlike you.

38:51.983 --> 38:54.184
If I recall, in the past,

38:54.219 --> 38:55.953
you have been
the most vocal opponent

38:55.987 --> 38:57.621
of miss Wells
having her freedom.

38:57.655 --> 39:00.891
Yeah... Well...

39:00.926 --> 39:05.429
My point is that in my gut,
I know that if she had to,

39:05.463 --> 39:09.700
h.G. Wells would give her life
for the warehouse.

39:09.735 --> 39:11.335
I know it.

39:11.369 --> 39:12.770
And I think I've earned
the occasional.

39:12.804 --> 39:14.705
"I'm gonna go
with Artie's gut on this."

39:14.739 --> 39:18.575
Don't you?

39:18.610 --> 39:20.377
Would you excuse us
for a moment?

39:20.412 --> 39:24.248
Yeah, take all
the time you need.

39:24.282 --> 39:26.517
- Thank you.
- Oh.

39:35.128 --> 39:37.396
We are inclined to go

39:37.430 --> 39:38.998
with Artie's gut on this,
as requested.

39:39.032 --> 39:41.167
This must, of course,
be taken up

39:41.201 --> 39:43.035
with the rest of the regents.
Of course.

39:43.070 --> 39:45.204
But given your
strong recommendation,

39:45.238 --> 39:46.739
I don't foresee a problem.

39:48.875 --> 39:51.377
Uh, thank you very much,
Mr. Kosan.

39:51.411 --> 39:54.613
Appreciate it.
Thank you.

39:59.286 --> 40:01.220
Got a lotta work to do...

40:01.254 --> 40:03.255
something strange is going on.

40:03.289 --> 40:04.456
Well, it's warehouse 13.

40:04.490 --> 40:06.324
I mean, isn't something strange
always going on?

40:06.359 --> 40:11.096
Not like this.

40:11.130 --> 40:16.100
No doubt you know what I mean.

40:16.135 --> 40:19.070
Arthur Nielsen
at a loss for words?

40:19.104 --> 40:22.774
You've done something.

40:22.809 --> 40:27.613
Don't be ridiculous.
I didn't do anything.

40:27.647 --> 40:28.814
I'm not at a loss for words.

40:28.849 --> 40:30.049
I simply don't
have anything to say.

40:30.084 --> 40:33.486
I will tell you...

40:37.458 --> 40:39.259
oh, dear God.

40:53.156 --> 40:57.392
Don't judge me.

40:57.426 --> 40:58.726
I didn't have any choice,
did I?

40:58.761 --> 41:02.697
I haven't slept
in two parallel universes.

41:04.166 --> 41:07.835
I'm exhausted.

41:09.504 --> 41:16.672
You will create an evil
of your own making.

41:37.094 --> 41:40.730
No!

41:40.764 --> 41:43.866
No! No!

41:43.901 --> 41:46.402
No!

41:46.436 --> 41:48.537
Artie!

41:52.474 --> 41:54.275
Oh...

41:56.912 --> 41:59.046
Artie?
Claudia's gone.

41:59.080 --> 42:00.881
She disappeared
in the middle of the night.

42:03.251 --> 42:09.222
An evil that will live with you
the rest of your days.
