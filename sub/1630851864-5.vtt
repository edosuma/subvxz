WEBVTT

00:04.461 --> 00:08.590
OLMEC: Mere mortals,
on an adventure to prove

00:08.632 --> 00:12.095
they are heroes
worthy of entering my temple.

00:13.762 --> 00:18.100
Thrust into an epic legend
told by generations

00:18.143 --> 00:21.271
of oral storytellers like me.

00:21.312 --> 00:23.815
Many versions
of these legends exist,

00:23.856 --> 00:29.111
but there is only one
Legend of the Hidden Temple!

00:32.698 --> 00:35.534
These four teams have
a chance to become heroes

00:35.576 --> 00:41.040
and win a king's ransom:
$25,000.

00:41.082 --> 00:46.128
But only one team may enter
my temple to try,

00:46.170 --> 00:49.673
and here's their guide
to tell them how to do it--

00:49.716 --> 00:52.469
Cristela Alonzo.

00:52.509 --> 00:54.929
Thanks, Olmec! Hey, everybody!

00:54.970 --> 00:56.972
-[cheering]
-You wanna go on an adventure?

00:57.015 --> 00:59.100
Let's do it.

00:59.142 --> 01:01.101
It's so great to see you.

01:01.143 --> 01:03.938
A pleasure, as always, Cristela.

01:03.979 --> 01:07.817
Olmec, you know your temple is
full of lost treasures

01:07.858 --> 01:10.861
from, like, the most amazing
legends throughout history.

01:10.903 --> 01:14.823
What legend are
our heroes living today?

01:14.865 --> 01:19.579
The Hindu legend of the 10,000
year pearl necklace of Rama.

01:20.537 --> 01:22.498
One of these
four teams of heroes

01:22.539 --> 01:24.292
has the chance
to enter your temple

01:24.334 --> 01:27.212
to retrieve the 10,000 year
pearl necklace of Rama

01:27.253 --> 01:28.921
and win that King's ransom.

01:28.962 --> 01:31.049
Will it be the Red Jaguars?

01:31.091 --> 01:34.551
College friends and roommates,
Kaylei and Lindsey.

01:34.593 --> 01:36.012
The Orange Iguanas.

01:36.054 --> 01:39.140
Best pals, Emma and Jackie.

01:39.182 --> 01:40.682
The Silver Snakes.

01:40.724 --> 01:43.103
Workout buddies,
Gyasi and Devonn.

01:43.144 --> 01:45.104
Or the Blue Barracudas.

01:45.146 --> 01:47.439
OG contestants, Nick and Josh.

01:47.481 --> 01:49.067
-I'm Nick.
-And I'm Josh!

01:49.109 --> 01:50.652
We're both former contestants.

01:50.692 --> 01:52.194
I was actually
a contestant on season one

01:52.236 --> 01:53.612
JOSH: I was on season two.

01:53.655 --> 01:55.698
We both made it to the temple.

01:55.740 --> 01:57.575
And on a side note,
we both lost.

01:57.616 --> 01:58.867
We're here for redemption,

01:58.909 --> 02:00.411
that's what we're here for.

02:00.453 --> 02:01.578
My name is Devonn.

02:01.620 --> 02:03.081
I'm Gyasi.

02:03.123 --> 02:04.957
-Fitness is life.
-We're super athletic.

02:04.998 --> 02:07.835
I believe till the day I die

02:07.876 --> 02:10.379
that I need to have a six-pack.

02:10.420 --> 02:12.173
CRISTELA:
Before we let our heroes loose

02:12.215 --> 02:13.550
to cross your moat, Olmec,

02:13.591 --> 02:14.967
tell us more about the legend.

02:16.343 --> 02:18.721
This story comes
from the Ramayana,

02:18.763 --> 02:21.765
the sacred Hindu epic
of the story of Rama.

02:22.432 --> 02:25.645
Young Rama travels to
a neighboring kingdom

02:25.687 --> 02:27.271
where Sita, a princess

02:27.312 --> 02:29.816
of unparalleled
beauty and strength,

02:29.858 --> 02:33.861
is holding a competition
to find a husband.

02:33.902 --> 02:37.448
A mighty bow left to her
ancestors by the god, Shiva,

02:37.490 --> 02:40.659
has gone unstrung
for generations.

02:40.701 --> 02:43.246
She will marry the man
who can string it.

02:43.288 --> 02:46.165
Rama not only strings the bow,

02:46.206 --> 02:49.918
he draws its back
and breaks it in two.

02:50.420 --> 02:52.588
Oh, snap.

02:52.629 --> 02:54.257
OLMEC: Indeed.

02:54.299 --> 02:56.091
And the wedding is on.

02:56.134 --> 03:00.221
Ten years pass and Rama's
father is ready to retire,

03:00.263 --> 03:02.639
leaving his kingdom to Rama.

03:02.681 --> 03:05.100
But this decision
does not sit well

03:05.143 --> 03:07.687
with one of the king's
other wives,

03:07.729 --> 03:11.983
who reminds him he promised
her son would be next in line.

03:12.025 --> 03:13.943
Unable to deny her,

03:13.985 --> 03:17.280
the king banishes Rama
and Sita to the forest,

03:17.322 --> 03:21.033
where they go
on the most epic quest.

03:21.074 --> 03:23.828
So, what does a pearl necklace
have to do with it?

03:23.870 --> 03:26.497
Shall I skip to
the end of the story

03:26.538 --> 03:28.040
and tell it backwards?

03:28.081 --> 03:29.250
[laughing]

03:31.336 --> 03:32.420
I'm Emma.

03:32.461 --> 03:34.129
Hi, I'm Jackie.

03:34.171 --> 03:36.382
We're very fun
and we're really down to clown.

03:36.424 --> 03:38.218
We're just as excited
to play the game

03:38.259 --> 03:39.635
as we are to maybe win.

03:40.552 --> 03:42.222
-I'm Kaylei.
-I'm Lindsey.

03:42.263 --> 03:43.848
And we're just ready
to come out here

03:43.889 --> 03:45.724
and have fun and win.
Our life is a party,

03:45.766 --> 03:47.727
and these games
are gonna be a party, too.

03:47.769 --> 03:50.729
Like Rama, our teams
are about to start a quest

03:50.771 --> 03:53.274
full of physical
and mental tests

03:53.316 --> 03:56.860
to determine which team is
worthy of entering your temple.

03:56.902 --> 03:59.197
The first test
is crossing your moat.

03:59.239 --> 04:00.657
Olmec,
how are we doing it today?

04:01.282 --> 04:03.575
Like Rama,
to prove your strength,

04:03.617 --> 04:07.330
you must string Shiva's bow
with three bow strings.

04:07.372 --> 04:09.873
When Cristela gives the signal,

04:09.915 --> 04:12.669
swim to either end of
the giant bow,

04:12.710 --> 04:14.920
where you will find
discs attached to

04:14.962 --> 04:17.423
the ends of several bow strings.

04:17.464 --> 04:20.759
Describe a symbol on
one disc to your teammate,

04:20.802 --> 04:22.720
who must find its match.

04:22.762 --> 04:25.389
Swim the discs to
the middle of the bow,

04:25.430 --> 04:29.018
connect them,
and try to string the bow.

04:29.060 --> 04:32.312
If you are correct,
the string will fit perfectly.

04:32.355 --> 04:36.776
But if the bow string sags
or is too short, try again.

04:37.276 --> 04:39.987
Once you have thrice
strung Shiva's bow,

04:40.028 --> 04:43.031
exit the moat
to find a real bow,

04:43.074 --> 04:46.076
and like Rama, break it in two.

04:46.119 --> 04:48.663
Then you may hit your gong.

04:48.704 --> 04:50.747
The first three teams
to hit their gong

04:50.790 --> 04:53.167
will continue their quest.

04:53.209 --> 04:57.504
The last team is out.

04:57.547 --> 04:59.132
Usually when we're at the pool,

04:59.173 --> 05:00.800
we're there to, like,
have fun and party.

05:00.841 --> 05:02.718
That's going to be a bit hard
for us today.

05:02.759 --> 05:06.055
There's no drinks
or anything, but we got this.

05:06.096 --> 05:07.973
Heroes, are you ready?

05:08.016 --> 05:10.560
ALL: Yeah!

05:10.600 --> 05:12.894
Hey, Olmec, are you ready?

05:12.937 --> 05:15.023
This rock is ready to roll.

05:15.064 --> 05:17.233
All right. On your mark...

05:17.274 --> 05:19.401
get set...

05:19.444 --> 05:20.819
go!

05:21.821 --> 05:23.363
They're off!

05:25.658 --> 05:27.535
Stuff just got real.
This is insane.

05:27.576 --> 05:29.329
JOSH: You have, like,
a squiggly one,

05:29.370 --> 05:31.456
-like a squiggly three?
-CRISTELA: Remember,

05:31.497 --> 05:33.624
if the symbols match, the bow
strings will fit perfectly,

05:33.665 --> 05:35.584
nice and tight,
like Shiva's bow.

05:36.418 --> 05:38.086
NICK: Which squiggle?

05:38.129 --> 05:40.005
How many squiggles?
Symbols are similar enough

05:40.048 --> 05:41.632
to fool you,
but not quite the same if

05:41.673 --> 05:43.343
they just share
the general shape.

05:43.384 --> 05:45.093
So, we have to be
all about the details.

05:45.136 --> 05:46.637
NICK: We got the whole thing?

05:46.678 --> 05:48.305
JOSH: Olmec is a tricky,
sly piece of rock

05:48.348 --> 05:49.557
that I don't take for granite.

05:49.598 --> 05:50.725
Do you get it?

05:52.060 --> 05:53.394
[indistinct].

05:55.480 --> 05:57.814
Right, wait for ya.

05:57.856 --> 05:59.358
CRISTELA: Blue Barracudas

05:59.399 --> 06:00.817
are the first team
to make a match.

06:00.860 --> 06:02.362
Let's see if that string fits.

06:05.197 --> 06:07.783
Yes! Blue Barracudas have
their first bow string.

06:07.824 --> 06:09.535
Two more to go!

06:09.576 --> 06:10.995
-You got that?
-JOSH: Yeah.

06:13.663 --> 06:16.042
I have trouble
just treading water,

06:16.084 --> 06:18.127
'cause I swim but I don't tread.

06:18.920 --> 06:20.504
DEVONN: Got it good.

06:20.545 --> 06:22.464
Sorry bro, gotta go!

06:24.716 --> 06:26.636
JACKIE: Emma,
look for an hourglass.

06:26.677 --> 06:29.055
There's so much noise,
you can hear the other teams.

06:29.096 --> 06:31.307
-What about a squiggly line?
-Pass me one of those.

06:31.348 --> 06:34.601
They're all tangled, I don't
know which one is which.

06:34.644 --> 06:36.437
Our ropes kind of got
all mixed up,

06:36.478 --> 06:38.980
and the ropes are all tied
around the snake,

06:39.023 --> 06:41.442
and we're trying to like,
get them untangled.

06:41.483 --> 06:43.026
JACKIE: I'm so confused here,

06:43.069 --> 06:44.987
I don't know how to
get them undone.

06:45.028 --> 06:46.988
Wait, I have an hourglass open.
I have an hourglass open.

06:47.031 --> 06:49.867
Ooh, the Orange Iguanas seem
to be making some progress.

06:49.908 --> 06:51.994
They have their first
bow string clipped in.

06:52.036 --> 06:53.788
Two to go.

06:53.829 --> 06:56.415
The Blue Barracudas just
clipped in string number two.

06:56.456 --> 06:58.418
One more for them.

06:59.209 --> 07:01.254
Okay, I have mine.
Clip your symbol to here.

07:01.295 --> 07:03.130
CRISTELA: Red Jaguars have none,

07:03.172 --> 07:04.966
and I'm officially worried
about the Silver Snakes.

07:05.007 --> 07:07.218
Gyasi's having
real problems treading water.

07:07.259 --> 07:09.470
It's eight feet deep
in the middle of the moat.

07:09.512 --> 07:11.221
When I realized
he couldn't float,

07:11.264 --> 07:12.723
I'm like, "Okay."

07:12.764 --> 07:14.684
Adrenaline pumping,
heart's racing.

07:14.725 --> 07:17.144
Our strategy
was formed around that.

07:17.185 --> 07:19.396
I was like, "Listen, what
I'll do is I'll swim to you,

07:19.439 --> 07:20.814
you connect them in the middle."

07:25.444 --> 07:27.612
CRISTELA: The new strategy
is paying off.

07:27.654 --> 07:30.199
Silver Snakes have their
first bow string.

07:30.240 --> 07:32.409
Red Jaguars have theirs, too.

07:32.451 --> 07:34.620
All four teams are on the board.

07:35.704 --> 07:37.415
A bit like a dog.

07:38.957 --> 07:41.168
JACKIE: Emma,
I only have one rope left.

07:42.795 --> 07:44.504
That is not it.

07:44.547 --> 07:46.257
CRISTELA:
That's two for Red Jaguar,

07:46.298 --> 07:48.050
same for Blue Barracudas
and Orange Iguanas.

07:48.091 --> 07:49.718
They each need one more.

07:49.759 --> 07:51.137
Silver Snakes still need two.

07:51.178 --> 07:52.721
Yeah, I don't have it.

07:52.762 --> 07:54.514
These ropes are too long.

07:54.557 --> 07:56.141
So, I'm like,
"Where's the short rope?"

07:56.183 --> 07:57.976
It looks like, uh--
it looks like this.

07:58.019 --> 07:59.478
-[indistinct]
-Yup.

07:59.519 --> 08:01.355
Coming in, coming in.

08:01.396 --> 08:03.064
Seeing other ropes go up,

08:03.107 --> 08:04.774
and seeing other people
almost where you are,

08:04.817 --> 08:06.360
you want to turn on the hustle

08:06.401 --> 08:07.862
and make sure that
you don't fall behind.

08:09.029 --> 08:10.447
Good to go.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.115
Orange Iguanas
are about to do it.

08:12.158 --> 08:13.826
Remember, they have
to both be on land

08:13.867 --> 08:15.661
and they hit that gong
for it to count.

08:15.702 --> 08:17.204
But before they do anything,

08:17.245 --> 08:19.540
they have to break
Shiva's bow in two.

08:24.836 --> 08:26.297
-Ready?
-Yeah.

08:28.216 --> 08:29.550
Get the gong!

08:31.177 --> 08:32.928
-[cheering]
-CRISTELA: The Orange Iguanas

08:32.970 --> 08:35.056
are the first team
to cross the moat.

08:35.096 --> 08:37.307
One step closer to
the temple run.

08:37.350 --> 08:39.559
We're like,
overjoyed, like, just
completely--

08:39.601 --> 08:41.729
I don't know. I'm just like,
losing my mind over this!

08:42.730 --> 08:45.274
CRISTELA: It's a race
for the last two spots.

08:45.691 --> 08:48.068
Oh, no. I don't think
it's the right one.

08:48.110 --> 08:49.695
CRISTELA: Will it be
the Blue Barracudas?

08:49.736 --> 08:51.447
They had an early lead

08:51.489 --> 08:53.448
before the Orange Iguanas
overtook them,

08:53.490 --> 08:56.744
the Red Jaguars
or the Silver Snakes?

08:56.786 --> 08:58.370
Let's go-- let's go with those.

08:58.412 --> 08:59.913
Oh man. 'Cause Josh is

08:59.956 --> 09:01.331
fumbling with the ropes,

09:01.374 --> 09:03.292
not able to match
up our symbols.

09:04.293 --> 09:05.961
But that's not it.

09:06.003 --> 09:07.712
JOSH: That's-- but what
about the one we have?

09:07.754 --> 09:10.006
It's close. Let me see
that one again. That's it.

09:10.048 --> 09:12.217
Okay, that's it.
That's it. That's it.

09:12.259 --> 09:15.096
Oh, Blue Barracudas seem
to have their third one.

09:15.136 --> 09:16.556
Oh, is it going to fit?

09:16.596 --> 09:18.224
If it does,
then they can swim in,

09:18.265 --> 09:19.892
break the bow, and hit the gong.

09:22.519 --> 09:24.688
Oh! Remember,
they both have to be on land,

09:24.730 --> 09:26.731
break the bow
before they can hit the gong.

09:32.779 --> 09:34.615
Break it.

09:34.657 --> 09:36.951
CRISTELA: Now that's
the way to break that bow!

09:36.993 --> 09:39.412
Blue Barracudas are
the second team moving on.

09:39.452 --> 09:41.581
We came, we saw,
we kicked the drum!

09:41.621 --> 09:44.417
We've got redemption coming.
Three more steps, baby.

09:44.457 --> 09:46.126
We're going to make it happen.

09:46.168 --> 09:47.878
CRISTELA: Only one more
team is moving on

09:47.919 --> 09:49.462
to the Steps of Knowledge.

09:49.504 --> 09:50.880
Silver Snakes will
have to hurry.

09:50.923 --> 09:52.758
They still need two bow strings.

09:52.799 --> 09:54.634
Red Jaguars, only one.

09:55.219 --> 09:56.345
Do you have that one?

09:57.346 --> 09:59.932
It was us
and Silver Snakes left.

09:59.974 --> 10:01.642
Both of us are struggling.

10:01.683 --> 10:04.061
And then we noticed
our symbols were mixed up.

10:04.102 --> 10:06.605
So, I started looking at
the lengths of the ropes.

10:06.647 --> 10:08.356
I told Keylei,
I said, "Grab that one.

10:08.399 --> 10:09.567
I'm flipping it."

10:11.027 --> 10:12.320
You got a short one?

10:12.360 --> 10:13.528
I dunno.

10:13.571 --> 10:15.447
These ropes are not connected.

10:15.489 --> 10:16.698
Gyasi's right.

10:16.740 --> 10:18.408
-Damn.
-Hey, bro.

10:21.412 --> 10:23.998
This is the last
possible option we have.

10:24.039 --> 10:25.582
I know this has to be right.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.418
So, I'm not waiting
for her to even clip it.

10:27.460 --> 10:28.836
I'm sprinting to the end,

10:28.878 --> 10:30.171
and Kaylei can catch up with me.

10:37.595 --> 10:39.179
CRISTELA:
They gotta break that bow.

10:39.221 --> 10:41.222
[bow snapping]

10:41.264 --> 10:43.475
Our final team
is the Red Jaguars.

10:43.517 --> 10:45.436
We are the underdogs right now,

10:45.477 --> 10:46.729
but we're gonna rise
to the occasion.

10:46.770 --> 10:48.563
Silver Snakes, unfortunately,

10:48.605 --> 10:50.106
you're not moving to
the next round,

10:50.149 --> 10:51.984
but you're not going
home empty handed.

10:52.025 --> 10:54.028
You get to keep those amazing
Silver Snakes T-shirts,

10:54.070 --> 10:56.029
and they look pretty
good on you!

10:56.864 --> 10:59.366
Moving on to the next round, and
one step closer

10:59.408 --> 11:02.827
to the Temple Run
and $25,000 are...

11:02.870 --> 11:04.621
the Red Jaguars,

11:04.663 --> 11:06.581
the Blue Barracudas,

11:06.624 --> 11:08.375
the Orange Iguanas.

11:08.417 --> 11:10.168
We got to see some of
their physical skills.

11:10.211 --> 11:12.004
Coming up next,
we test their smarts

11:12.046 --> 11:13.547
on the Steps of Knowledge,

11:13.589 --> 11:14.965
right when we come back.

11:15.006 --> 11:16.091
Stay tuned.

11:16.133 --> 11:18.344
[cheering]

11:22.932 --> 11:25.809
CRISTELA: Welcome back to
Legends of the Hidden Temple.

11:25.850 --> 11:28.062
-Teams, how you feeling?
-[cheering]

11:28.104 --> 11:30.355
You look so great,
I love to see it.

11:30.398 --> 11:32.732
Orange Iguanas,
you crossed the moat first.

11:32.774 --> 11:34.567
I gotta ask you,
do you think you've got

11:34.610 --> 11:35.903
what it takes to do this level?

11:35.945 --> 11:37.028
-We're ready.
-Absolutely.

11:37.071 --> 11:38.447
Feeling amazing.

11:38.489 --> 11:39.990
I'm about as smart
as a 13-year-old.

11:40.032 --> 11:42.534
My short-term memory
comes and goes.

11:42.576 --> 11:44.912
So, I'm going to look to Jackie
for some of this stuff,

11:44.953 --> 11:47.539
but I'll still be buzzing in
if I think I know the answer.

11:47.581 --> 11:49.625
We just saw you cross the moat.

11:49.667 --> 11:52.043
Now, let's see how
smart you are.

11:52.086 --> 11:54.046
I want you
to listen carefully to Olmec

11:54.087 --> 11:56.215
as he gives you
the origins of the legend

11:56.256 --> 12:00.510
of the 10,000 year pearl
necklace of Rama. Olmec?

12:01.010 --> 12:02.513
Banished to the forest,

12:02.554 --> 12:04.974
Rama takes
his faithful wife, Sita,

12:05.014 --> 12:07.017
his half brother Lakshmana,

12:07.058 --> 12:10.812
and his magic bow and quiver
with unlimited arrows.

12:10.855 --> 12:13.023
He and Lakshmana hunt for days

12:13.065 --> 12:16.067
until they come upon
a bloodthirsty demon

12:16.110 --> 12:20.197
named Surpanakha,
who finds Rama irresistible.

12:20.239 --> 12:22.450
Rama politely declines
the advances.

12:22.490 --> 12:26.537
So, Surpanakha turns
her affections to Lakshmana,

12:26.578 --> 12:30.374
who promptly...
cuts off her nose.

12:30.416 --> 12:33.085
Infuriated at the diss,

12:33.126 --> 12:36.755
she calls on one of her brothers
to defend her honor.

12:36.797 --> 12:41.469
He sends an army of
14,000 soldiers to attack Rama,

12:41.509 --> 12:44.388
who singlehandedly
defeats them all.

12:44.429 --> 12:47.892
Surpanakha runs
to another brother, Ravana,

12:47.932 --> 12:50.519
the evil 10-headed
ruler of Lanka,

12:50.561 --> 12:53.272
who hatches
a plan to get to Rama

12:53.313 --> 12:55.899
by kidnapping and killing Sita.

12:55.941 --> 12:58.027
So, he disguises another demon

12:58.067 --> 13:00.696
as a beautiful golden deer.

13:00.738 --> 13:03.072
Sita sees it and wants it.

13:03.657 --> 13:04.950
"Rama, be a dear.

13:04.991 --> 13:07.369
Bring me that golden deer."

13:07.410 --> 13:09.746
Rama smells something fishy.

13:09.788 --> 13:12.666
So, he draws a magical
protective circle

13:12.707 --> 13:14.585
around his wife.

13:14.626 --> 13:18.963
"As long as you stay in
this circle, you will be safe."

13:19.005 --> 13:22.467
He heads out with his brother
to bring back the deer.

13:22.509 --> 13:25.346
Meanwhile,
Ravana dons a disguise

13:25.386 --> 13:27.556
of a holy man begging for food,

13:27.597 --> 13:30.225
and goes to Sita for help.

13:30.267 --> 13:33.229
The well-meaning Sita leaves
the protective circle

13:33.269 --> 13:36.231
just enough
for Ravana to grab her

13:36.273 --> 13:38.984
and whisk her to
his flying chariot.

13:39.025 --> 13:42.446
Rama and Lakshmana
return with the golden deer

13:42.488 --> 13:44.740
to find Sita gone.

13:47.201 --> 13:49.370
So much of the legend is about

13:49.411 --> 13:51.330
bringing back the people
that matter to you,

13:51.371 --> 13:53.123
sticking together as a team.

13:53.164 --> 13:55.042
Um, I would light myself
on fire for you, Jackie.

13:55.084 --> 13:56.836
I would light myself on
fire for you, too.

13:56.876 --> 13:58.837
We might have to. If I have
to sacrifice myself for--

13:58.879 --> 14:01.005
I don't know, maybe that's an
element of it. You never know.

14:01.048 --> 14:02.591
I feel like
we're back in college,

14:02.633 --> 14:04.176
like, taking finals again,
except, like,

14:04.217 --> 14:05.719
there's bigger stakes now.

14:05.760 --> 14:08.556
This is the craziest
sense of déjà vu,

14:08.596 --> 14:10.682
and I'm terrified.

14:10.724 --> 14:14.102
These are the Steps
of Knowledge.

14:14.144 --> 14:16.105
Olmec will be
asking you questions

14:16.145 --> 14:17.730
about the legend you just heard.

14:17.773 --> 14:20.650
He'll also ask general
knowledge questions

14:20.692 --> 14:22.152
related to the story.

14:22.193 --> 14:24.153
Once he's done asking
the question,

14:24.196 --> 14:25.739
if you know the answer,

14:25.780 --> 14:27.575
step on the ancient marking
in front of you.

14:27.615 --> 14:29.869
If correct,
you'll take a step down,

14:29.909 --> 14:32.538
if not, or if you take too long,

14:32.580 --> 14:34.706
the other teams have a chance.

14:34.748 --> 14:37.125
The first two teams
to get to the bottom

14:37.167 --> 14:39.168
will move on to
the Temple Games.

14:39.211 --> 14:42.213
The last team will be out.

14:42.255 --> 14:45.341
Olmec, first question, please.

14:45.384 --> 14:48.220
How many heads does Ravana have?

14:48.261 --> 14:50.306
-[bell rattles]
-CRISTELA: Blue Barracudas?

14:50.346 --> 14:52.307
-10.
-That is correct.

14:53.267 --> 14:55.059
Blue Barracudas moved down.

14:55.101 --> 14:56.937
It looked like you were
tap dancing there. Love it.

14:56.979 --> 14:58.480
Love the passion!

14:58.522 --> 15:00.231
All right.
Olmec, next question please.

15:00.274 --> 15:03.693
Ravana sends a demon
to distract Sita,

15:03.735 --> 15:05.403
disguised as a golden what?

15:05.446 --> 15:06.697
[bell rattles]

15:06.739 --> 15:07.865
CRISTELA: Blue Barracudas?

15:07.907 --> 15:09.033
Deer.

15:09.741 --> 15:11.576
That is correct.

15:11.619 --> 15:13.453
CRISTELA: Blue Barracudas,
another step down.

15:13.495 --> 15:16.749
We've been on this journey
for almost 30 years

15:16.789 --> 15:18.625
to get back to this spot.

15:18.667 --> 15:21.503
And this is not where our
journey ends on this last step,

15:21.544 --> 15:23.297
looking at that final step.

15:23.338 --> 15:25.173
CRISTELA: All right, Olmec,
next question.

15:25.215 --> 15:28.134
OLMEC: Emperor Shah Jahan built

15:28.177 --> 15:30.678
which of these famous
tourist sites

15:30.721 --> 15:34.224
as a mausoleum
to immortalize his wife?

15:34.265 --> 15:35.558
-[bell rattles]
-CRISTELA: Oh!

15:35.600 --> 15:37.644
-Orange Iguanas?
-Taj Mahal.

15:37.686 --> 15:39.480
-OLMEC: That is correct.
-CRISTELA: Ooh!

15:39.520 --> 15:41.981
Orange Iguanas,
take your step down.

15:42.024 --> 15:43.984
Olmec, next question.

15:44.025 --> 15:46.611
What is Rama's
little brother's name?

15:46.653 --> 15:48.655
-[bell rattles]
-CRISTELA: Orange Iguanas.

15:48.697 --> 15:49.865
Laskshmana.

15:49.907 --> 15:52.283
OLMEC: That is correct.

15:52.326 --> 15:54.119
CRISTELA: Orange Iguanas,
come down.

15:54.161 --> 15:55.870
It's neck and neck between
the Orange Iguanas

15:55.913 --> 15:57.831
and the Blue Barracudas to see

15:57.873 --> 16:00.000
who will be the first to move
on to the Temple Games.

16:00.042 --> 16:02.628
Red Jaguars are still in
the game, don't worry.

16:02.669 --> 16:04.379
There's two spaces, three teams.

16:04.421 --> 16:06.381
Okay, it's time to kick it
into gear. Time to go.

16:06.423 --> 16:08.424
We're not gonna lose this.

16:08.466 --> 16:10.259
CRISTELA: Next question, please.

16:10.302 --> 16:13.138
Known for its huge musical
productions,

16:13.179 --> 16:16.600
India's film industry
is often referred to

16:16.642 --> 16:18.018
-as what?
-[bell rattles]

16:18.059 --> 16:19.477
CRISTELA: Red Jaguars.

16:19.519 --> 16:20.604
Bollywood?

16:20.645 --> 16:22.398
OLMEC: That is correct.

16:22.438 --> 16:24.984
[Cristela laughing]

16:25.024 --> 16:27.193
[together] Yes!
One question right!

16:27.235 --> 16:28.946
That general knowledge stuff.

16:29.822 --> 16:31.907
CRISTELA: Olmec, next question.

16:31.948 --> 16:35.744
The king banishes Rama
to which of these locations?

16:35.786 --> 16:37.620
-[bell rattles]
-CRISTELA: Blue Barracudas.

16:37.663 --> 16:38.956
Forest.

16:39.288 --> 16:42.418
-Correct.
-CRISTELA: Oh, Blue Barracudas!

16:42.459 --> 16:44.086
Congratulations,
you have made it down

16:44.128 --> 16:45.796
the Steps of Knowledge.

16:45.837 --> 16:47.423
You will be going on to
the Temple Games.

16:47.463 --> 16:49.383
The Steps of Knowledge
has definitely been

16:49.424 --> 16:51.759
one of our biggest fears, and
now we are past that hurdle.

16:51.802 --> 16:53.761
So, it's good
to not worry for a half second

16:53.803 --> 16:55.972
until reality sets in that
the Temple Games are ahead.

16:56.014 --> 16:57.474
I'm enjoying it, though.

16:57.515 --> 16:59.518
We still have
one more team needed.

16:59.559 --> 17:00.894
So, it's anybody's game.

17:00.936 --> 17:02.937
Olmec, next question.

17:03.522 --> 17:06.858
Rama defeats an army of
how many soldiers?

17:06.900 --> 17:08.359
-[bell rattles]
-CRISTELA: Orange Iguanas.

17:08.402 --> 17:09.486
14,000.

17:09.528 --> 17:11.113
OLMEC: That is correct.

17:11.154 --> 17:12.865
CRISTELA: Oh! Orange Iguanas,

17:12.905 --> 17:14.115
you have made it.

17:14.657 --> 17:16.410
We wanted to make it
to the Temple Games

17:16.451 --> 17:18.244
because we know that
that's where the real fun is.

17:18.287 --> 17:19.954
CRISTELA: Blue Barracudas,
Orange Iguanas

17:19.997 --> 17:21.999
will be going on to
the Temple Games.

17:22.040 --> 17:24.250
Red Jaguars, unfortunately
that means that you're out.

17:24.292 --> 17:26.420
But you won't be leaving
empty handed.

17:26.461 --> 17:28.172
Tell them what they won.

17:28.212 --> 17:29.839
ANNOUNCER: On top of
your Red Jaguar shirts,

17:29.882 --> 17:31.633
you're going home with
a whole bunch

17:31.674 --> 17:33.969
of Legends of the Hidden
Temple signature swag,

17:34.010 --> 17:36.346
including limited edition hats,
beach towels,

17:36.387 --> 17:38.140
sports chairs, spike ball sets,

17:38.182 --> 17:40.601
and giant Olmec party coolers
for each of you.

17:40.642 --> 17:43.144
Yes! Well, there you have it.

17:43.186 --> 17:45.605
Orange Iguanas
and the Blue Barracudas,

17:45.646 --> 17:48.150
one step closer to racing
through Olmec's temple

17:48.192 --> 17:50.193
for $25,000.

17:50.234 --> 17:52.779
Coming up next,
the teams go head-to-head

17:52.820 --> 17:54.823
in the Temple Games
when we come back.

17:54.865 --> 17:55.949
Stay tuned.

17:55.990 --> 17:57.659
Woo!

18:02.914 --> 18:04.583
Yes!

18:04.625 --> 18:06.876
Welcome back to Legends
of the Hidden Temple.

18:06.919 --> 18:09.962
Now, you have seen
our heroes cross Olmec's moat,

18:10.005 --> 18:12.508
and make their way down
the Steps of Knowledge.

18:12.548 --> 18:15.219
Now the only thing
standing between them

18:15.259 --> 18:19.138
and a shot at $25,000
are these Temple Games.

18:19.181 --> 18:20.598
Still with us,
we have Josh and Nick,

18:20.641 --> 18:22.683
-the Blue Barracudas.
-Oh, we love ya!

18:22.726 --> 18:25.520
CRISTELA: And Jackie and Emma,
the Orange Iguanas.

18:25.561 --> 18:26.855
We're ready to get out there

18:26.896 --> 18:29.566
and kind of lose
our minds, okay?

18:29.607 --> 18:32.027
So, get ready because

18:32.068 --> 18:33.694
we're not holding it
back anymore.

18:33.737 --> 18:36.824
Now, both of you teams
will be competing for

18:36.865 --> 18:38.491
the Pendant of Life.

18:38.534 --> 18:40.493
-Cristela, it's beautiful!
-I know, isn't it?

18:40.536 --> 18:42.162
But don't stare at it directly.

18:42.203 --> 18:44.205
They will need them
to protect themselves

18:44.248 --> 18:46.165
from the dreaded temple guards
as they make their way

18:46.208 --> 18:47.792
through Olmec's temple.

18:47.835 --> 18:50.753
The first team to collect
two Pendants of Life

18:50.796 --> 18:52.338
have proven themselves worthy,

18:52.381 --> 18:55.174
and will be allowed
to enter Olmec's temple.

18:55.217 --> 18:57.219
Now, the first game,

18:57.260 --> 18:59.011
we're doing one team at a time.

18:59.054 --> 19:01.056
Blue Barracudas,
you won the Steps of Knowledge,

19:01.097 --> 19:03.057
and you have decided
to go second.

19:03.099 --> 19:05.144
We decide to let
the Orange Iguanas

19:05.184 --> 19:06.603
go headfirst on the challenge--

19:06.644 --> 19:08.105
Because we're gentlemen.

19:08.146 --> 19:09.897
And strategists.

19:09.940 --> 19:11.357
Okay, that more.

19:11.400 --> 19:13.527
Orange Iguanas team,
go get ready.

19:13.568 --> 19:15.069
JACKIE: Let's go, Emma.

19:15.112 --> 19:16.696
Now, we're going to have
Olmec tell us more

19:16.738 --> 19:19.282
about Temple Game number one.

19:20.200 --> 19:22.952
Ravana whisks Sita
to his flying chariot

19:22.994 --> 19:24.453
to take her back to Lanka

19:24.496 --> 19:27.915
to use her as bait
to get to Rama.

19:27.958 --> 19:29.710
But the ever-resourceful Sita

19:29.750 --> 19:31.586
breaks off her necklace

19:31.627 --> 19:35.423
and secretly drops precious gems
to monkeys below,

19:35.464 --> 19:38.259
leaving Rama a path to find her.

19:38.301 --> 19:42.096
Unfortunately, before Rama
can follow the trail,

19:42.138 --> 19:44.016
the monkeys hide the gems.

19:44.057 --> 19:47.185
So, you must
find replacements and put them

19:47.227 --> 19:48.979
under the right trees

19:49.020 --> 19:52.191
so Rama can find the way.

19:52.231 --> 19:53.942
When Cristela gives the signal,

19:53.983 --> 19:55.861
one player run to a tree

19:55.903 --> 19:58.822
and look for a clue
to the missing gem.

19:58.864 --> 20:02.075
Relay the clue to your teammate
on top of the mountain,

20:02.116 --> 20:05.162
who must slide down
to that gem barrel

20:05.203 --> 20:06.954
and find the match.

20:06.997 --> 20:09.040
Take the gem back
up the mountain

20:09.082 --> 20:11.210
and throw it to your teammate

20:11.250 --> 20:13.628
to place it on the right tree.

20:13.670 --> 20:15.422
Return the four gems,

20:15.463 --> 20:18.967
and then you may hit your gong
to stop the clock.

20:19.009 --> 20:23.846
The team that returns
the gems the fastest, wins.

20:23.888 --> 20:26.642
CRISTELA: All right.
Olmec, set the Clock.

20:27.476 --> 20:28.977
On your mark...

20:29.019 --> 20:30.269
get set...

20:31.230 --> 20:32.355
go!

20:33.690 --> 20:35.567
Wow! Fast start.

20:35.608 --> 20:37.736
All right, Emma, it's a triangle
with a line and a squiggly,

20:37.778 --> 20:39.654
-two dots underneath.
-EMMA: Okay.

20:39.695 --> 20:41.615
JACKIE: Triangle,
line with a squiggly above it,

20:41.656 --> 20:43.241
-two dots underneath.
-EMMA: Triangle and a line--

20:43.282 --> 20:44.660
JACKIE: Two dots are
at the bottom.

20:44.701 --> 20:45.868
CRISTELA: Great communication.

20:45.911 --> 20:47.496
JACKIE: Yes. Yes, yes.

20:47.537 --> 20:48.955
CRISTELA:
They got the first one, though,

20:48.997 --> 20:50.499
so that's a great start
right now.

20:50.539 --> 20:51.959
-EMMA: Okay, ready?
-JACKIE: Yep.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.252
-She's tough.
-She's super quick.

20:55.586 --> 20:56.797
CRISTELA: That's one jewel.

20:56.837 --> 20:58.464
They have three more to go.

20:59.799 --> 21:01.593
The main thing is an X,
it's like a snowflake,

21:01.634 --> 21:03.220
-like an asterisk.
-EMMA: Here.

21:03.261 --> 21:05.221
-JACKIE: Yes.
-Oh man.

21:05.263 --> 21:06.682
The Orange Iguanas
are doing great

21:06.722 --> 21:08.099
at communicating with
each other.

21:08.141 --> 21:09.226
They're already on
their second one.

21:09.268 --> 21:10.477
JACKIE: Got it.

21:10.519 --> 21:12.144
We're moving as fast as we can,

21:12.186 --> 21:13.980
and I know we're going
to keep this speed up

21:14.021 --> 21:15.648
until we hit that gong.
All right.

21:15.691 --> 21:17.651
This is a circle.
It kind of looks a little bit

21:17.692 --> 21:19.736
like a basketball.
Line, two vertical lines.

21:20.778 --> 21:23.323
Yeah, uh... yes.

21:23.365 --> 21:28.619
[Emma panting]

21:28.662 --> 21:30.705
CRISTELA: Ooh, they have
three jewels down.

21:31.373 --> 21:33.250
Only one more!

21:33.291 --> 21:34.710
So, this is terrifying. I mean,

21:34.750 --> 21:37.837
these are two healthy
young adults

21:37.878 --> 21:39.088
that we're playing against.

21:39.131 --> 21:41.258
And we are not.

21:41.299 --> 21:42.843
No, we're not.

21:42.884 --> 21:44.302
-EMMA: What is it?
-JACKIE: A long X,

21:44.344 --> 21:45.511
carrot crossing it,

21:45.554 --> 21:47.263
two dots on the right hand side.

21:47.306 --> 21:49.682
This is kind of complicated.
It's an X--

21:49.724 --> 21:51.768
Turn it, turn it, turn it. Yes.

21:51.809 --> 21:54.229
CRISTELA: Wow. Emma and
Jackie are quick.

21:58.357 --> 21:59.483
Gotta get it, get it.

22:00.192 --> 22:02.403
-EMMA: Is it right?
-JACKIE: Got it, got it.

22:03.864 --> 22:06.407
[cheering]

22:06.450 --> 22:08.660
Yes! The Orange Iguanas
have hit the gong.

22:08.701 --> 22:10.828
They clocked in at two minutes
and one second.

22:10.871 --> 22:13.205
That means the Blue Barracudas
have to beat that time

22:13.248 --> 22:15.083
in order to get
the Pendant of Life.

22:15.125 --> 22:16.460
So, let's get to it.

22:16.500 --> 22:18.836
Blue Barracudas, get ready.

22:18.878 --> 22:20.922
-[clapping and cheering]
-Good luck.

22:20.963 --> 22:22.758
I'm really proud of our run
because Emma

22:22.798 --> 22:25.218
is climbing up the mountain
insanely fast.

22:25.259 --> 22:26.720
Every time I look up,
she's there.

22:26.761 --> 22:28.387
I didn't catch the fourth gem,

22:28.430 --> 22:30.682
but it felt like we picked it
right back up.

22:30.723 --> 22:32.392
Are you ready to do this,
Josh and Nick?

22:32.433 --> 22:34.894
Cristela, our friendship hangs
in the balance.

22:34.935 --> 22:36.730
[Cristela laughing]

22:36.771 --> 22:38.022
I never liked you that much,
anyways.

22:38.065 --> 22:40.483
Intense.
All right, Josh and Nick,

22:40.525 --> 22:42.693
you have to beat
two minutes and one second

22:42.736 --> 22:45.072
to beat Emma and Jackie.

22:45.113 --> 22:47.240
On your mark...

22:47.281 --> 22:49.492
get set...

22:49.534 --> 22:50.868
go!

22:52.578 --> 22:54.163
Josh is pretty tall.

22:54.205 --> 22:55.957
I'm not sure if that's
the best strategy

22:55.999 --> 22:58.417
-for climbing uphill.
-Maybe those long legs help?

22:58.460 --> 23:00.461
NICK: Two dots underneath a--
it looks like a cup,

23:00.503 --> 23:02.255
-like a triangle with a line.
-JOSH: Yep.

23:02.297 --> 23:04.383
NICK: And--
and squiggly blocks on top.

23:04.423 --> 23:06.468
We're representing Rama.
We're out there to fight.

23:06.509 --> 23:08.095
We're the strongest in the land.

23:08.135 --> 23:11.431
I've got my Sita,
and we're going to kill it.

23:11.472 --> 23:12.682
[Josh giggling]

23:12.723 --> 23:13.933
NICK: Are you sure it's--?

23:13.974 --> 23:15.644
JOSH: No? Uh...

23:15.684 --> 23:17.436
NICK: No, wait.
No, that's right. It's right.

23:17.479 --> 23:18.896
-JOSH: All right, keep going.
Go, go, go.

23:18.939 --> 23:20.606
NICK: It's a pound sign.
Hashtag.

23:20.648 --> 23:22.901
Hashtag with a dot at
the top and the bottom.

23:22.942 --> 23:24.944
-JOSH: This?
-NICK: Turn it. Yes, yes.

23:24.986 --> 23:27.029
CRISTELA: Oh, man. Okay,
the Blue Barracudas are good.

23:27.071 --> 23:29.031
They're on their way to get
their second gem right now.

23:29.074 --> 23:30.534
NICK: Go, go, go, go, go!

23:30.575 --> 23:32.536
JOSH: I'm coming.

23:32.576 --> 23:34.121
Give it to me.

23:34.162 --> 23:36.873
NICK: It's a go.
It's a circle with two--

23:36.914 --> 23:39.792
like, three lines, circling
a hamburger with--

23:39.835 --> 23:41.420
I think so.

23:42.378 --> 23:44.088
Go, go, go, go, go.

23:44.881 --> 23:46.133
JOSH: Get it, buddy.

23:46.173 --> 23:48.343
Give me the last one, man.

23:48.801 --> 23:50.679
JACKIE: It's gonna be so close.

23:50.720 --> 23:52.638
Those grown men really want
to win this children's game.

23:52.681 --> 23:54.391
And frankly, we do, too.

23:54.432 --> 23:56.268
NICK: It's a-- it's a--
it's like a rainbow.

23:56.308 --> 23:58.310
It's like an arch, with--
with a line underneath,

23:58.353 --> 23:59.770
and an upside-down triangle.

24:01.021 --> 24:02.231
It's like a rainbow.

24:02.273 --> 24:04.651
No, it's like an arch. Arch.

24:04.692 --> 24:06.819
Arch-- uh, no, no.

24:06.862 --> 24:08.279
Uh, I think so, yes.

24:08.320 --> 24:09.573
[Josh panting]

24:09.614 --> 24:11.907
NICK: Go, go, go, go, go! Go!

24:11.950 --> 24:13.326
JOSH: Got it.

24:14.994 --> 24:18.205
CRISTELA: Oh, it's so close!

24:18.248 --> 24:20.666
NICK: Go, go, go!
Come on, come on, come on!

24:21.125 --> 24:23.002
CRISTELA: With 18
seconds to spare,

24:23.044 --> 24:24.546
Blue Barracudas win.

24:24.587 --> 24:26.131
You know, Blue Barracudas,

24:26.173 --> 24:28.633
you have won your first
Pendant of Life.

24:28.674 --> 24:30.719
Cristela, it looks beautiful
in your hand!

24:30.759 --> 24:33.471
CRISTELA: You do need two
to move on to the Temple Run.

24:33.512 --> 24:34.847
We're feeling good.

24:34.890 --> 24:36.432
-We just-- we won--
-Crazy!

24:36.474 --> 24:38.309
We won the pendant.
It gives us a little bit

24:38.351 --> 24:40.269
of breathing room to where--

24:40.311 --> 24:42.105
our backs aren't against the
walls like the Orange Iguanas.

24:42.146 --> 24:44.106
Orange Iguanas,
hey, you can still redeem
yourself

24:44.148 --> 24:46.276
in Temple Game
number two when we come back.

24:46.317 --> 24:47.402
Stay tuned.

24:47.443 --> 24:51.030
[cheering]

24:53.825 --> 24:56.036
[cheering]

24:56.076 --> 24:58.829
Oh, welcome back to Legends
of the Hidden Temple.

24:58.872 --> 25:00.999
Blue Barracudas,
congratulations, you have won

25:01.040 --> 25:02.791
your first Pendant of Life.

25:02.834 --> 25:05.420
We're pretty winded
from that last event

25:05.461 --> 25:08.798
and having to go into this
next event, you know,

25:08.839 --> 25:10.925
it's--
we're-- we're nervous.

25:10.967 --> 25:12.635
You need two
Pendants of Life

25:12.676 --> 25:14.637
in order to move
onto the Temple Run.

25:14.679 --> 25:16.806
Lucky for both teams,
I have another

25:16.847 --> 25:19.476
Pendant of Life,
and it's up for grabs.

25:19.518 --> 25:21.853
This game is being
played at the same time.

25:21.894 --> 25:23.939
So, teams,
go get ready while Olmec

25:23.980 --> 25:26.273
tells us about
Temple game number two.

25:27.776 --> 25:30.694
Rama stops at
the Monkey Kingdom to conscript

25:30.737 --> 25:34.449
the General Hanuman
to help him find Sita.

25:34.490 --> 25:36.867
Hanuman is a flying monkey

25:36.910 --> 25:39.871
and locates
Sita in Ravana's lair.

25:39.913 --> 25:42.082
But she thinks
Hanuman is actually

25:42.123 --> 25:44.625
Ravana in yet another disguise.

25:44.667 --> 25:48.255
She demands Rama
come rescue her himself.

25:48.296 --> 25:52.968
So, Rama and Hanuman assemble
an army of flying monkeys

25:53.009 --> 25:56.762
who build a causeway
over the ocean to Ravana's lair.

25:56.805 --> 26:00.849
In this game,
you are Rama, assembling

26:00.892 --> 26:05.271
your army of flying monkeys,
and building the causeway.

26:06.690 --> 26:08.482
When Cristela
gives the signal,

26:08.525 --> 26:11.778
one of you start building
the causeway by placing

26:11.819 --> 26:14.446
a plank between
the first two pillars.

26:14.489 --> 26:18.034
Your teammate must
use that slinging device

26:18.076 --> 26:21.913
to build your monkey army
by launching a flying monkey

26:21.954 --> 26:25.250
to you that
you must catch in the air.

26:25.291 --> 26:28.336
Walk back across the causeway
without falling off,

26:28.377 --> 26:32.007
hand the monkey to your partner,
and swap roles.

26:32.048 --> 26:35.676
Repeat the process
until the causeway is complete

26:35.719 --> 26:39.013
and you have five
monkeys in your army.

26:39.055 --> 26:42.726
Then go back over
the road one final time

26:42.767 --> 26:46.354
without falling off,
and run over and hit your gong.

26:46.395 --> 26:51.317
The first team
to hit their gong... wins.

26:52.443 --> 26:58.032
All right, teams.
On your mark... get set... go!

26:59.159 --> 27:02.037
This game requires
balance and accuracy,

27:02.077 --> 27:04.913
and these two teams
are pretty evenly matched.

27:05.914 --> 27:07.541
Have you seen the monkeys,
though?

27:07.584 --> 27:09.169
I mean, they're
really kind of adorable.

27:09.210 --> 27:10.628
I want to catch
these little cute monkeys.

27:10.670 --> 27:12.756
[giggles]
That would be me.

27:13.381 --> 27:15.424
They have to catch
the monkeys on the fly.

27:15.467 --> 27:17.051
NICK: Get it.

27:17.093 --> 27:19.346
They both caught
their first monkey

27:19.386 --> 27:21.513
pretty easy,
but they have to get five,

27:21.556 --> 27:23.557
and they keep
getting further away.

27:23.599 --> 27:26.810
If Josh and Nick win this,
they will have two

27:26.853 --> 27:29.521
Pendants of Life and will
be going to the Temple Run.

27:29.564 --> 27:32.776
But Emma and Jackie win,
they force a tie breaker.

27:32.817 --> 27:34.318
JACKIE: I got monkey.

27:35.362 --> 27:37.154
Emma has her second monkey.

27:37.197 --> 27:38.906
Now she has
to hand them off to Jackie

27:38.948 --> 27:41.451
to catch their third,
building that monkey army.

27:41.492 --> 27:43.952
Blue Barracudas,
one handed catch.

27:43.994 --> 27:46.122
Alright, get that plank, man.
The fact that we have to

27:46.163 --> 27:48.083
switch off, we can't just put
one person

27:48.124 --> 27:50.210
with the strength on
the slingshot, and the other

27:50.250 --> 27:52.086
person with
balance on the tree stumps,

27:52.127 --> 27:54.422
we definitely have to
be equally footed on this one.

27:54.463 --> 27:56.298
So, we're not feeling
super confident on this one.

27:56.340 --> 27:58.300
-JOSH: First up.
-NICK: Where?

27:58.343 --> 28:00.010
JOSH: Right there.
No, right there.

28:00.053 --> 28:02.346
EMMA: And she takes
the monkeys... and you go.

28:02.388 --> 28:04.348
When you're in
the moment, you're just like,

28:04.391 --> 28:05.849
"I have the monkeys.
I need to go.

28:05.892 --> 28:07.810
I have the monkeys,
I have to go."

28:07.852 --> 28:10.145
"I have the monkeys, but do I go
back with them--" The monkeys

28:10.188 --> 28:12.147
are kind of everywhere, so--
so, what I do with monkeys?"

28:12.190 --> 28:13.942
EMMA:
I have two monkeys.

28:14.692 --> 28:16.318
JACKIE: Ready.
JOSH: And our third one.

28:17.653 --> 28:18.363
JACKIE: Got it.

28:20.073 --> 28:23.076
CRISTELA: Careful!
They each have three monkeys.

28:23.117 --> 28:26.246
Two more to go. But the causeway
gets longer, too.

28:26.287 --> 28:28.998
Ooh, Orange Iguanas
are slightly in the lead.

28:29.415 --> 28:31.459
The slingshot is the thing
that keeps tripping us up.

28:31.500 --> 28:33.252
It's like, tied a little
different on both sides.

28:33.294 --> 28:35.171
You think you're doing it
in the center, but then

28:35.212 --> 28:36.923
it goes one way because
that side is tighter.

28:36.964 --> 28:38.298
Untwist the slingshot.
Untwist the slingshot.

28:38.340 --> 28:40.426
And then I realize it's twisted.

28:40.468 --> 28:42.929
-You're like, "Untwist!"
-"Untwist it, untwist it!"

28:42.971 --> 28:46.141
CRISTELA: That's a long way,
even for flying monkeys.

28:46.182 --> 28:47.892
A little further, buddy.

28:47.933 --> 28:50.561
This is nothing
but grit and just the want of--

28:50.603 --> 28:52.896
of getting through, and just in
the back of your head knowing

28:52.939 --> 28:54.606
-this is it...
-Doing great.

28:54.648 --> 28:56.692
To get into that temple.

28:58.903 --> 29:01.196
-JOSH: Easy, easy.
-CRISTELA: This is a race

29:01.239 --> 29:03.532
with one more to go,
and everything is on the line.

29:03.575 --> 29:05.034
Man!
The Blue Barracudas

29:05.076 --> 29:06.744
and the Orange Iguanas
are neck to neck.

29:06.786 --> 29:08.538
JOSH: Come on,
buddy, you're sober.

29:08.579 --> 29:10.123
EMMA: Last chance, Jackie.
Let's do it.

29:10.164 --> 29:11.833
JOSH: Here it comes.

29:12.834 --> 29:14.376
-EMMA: Ready?
-JACKIE: Ready.

29:15.627 --> 29:17.630
It's okay,
just go really low and far.

29:17.672 --> 29:20.467
Oh, man, this is it. We're
coming down to the last monkey.

29:20.508 --> 29:23.761
We are literally waiting to try
to catch the final monkey.

29:23.803 --> 29:25.805
And we're doing
it simultaneously.

29:28.849 --> 29:30.684
JACKIE: Can you aim--
aim towards this way.

29:30.727 --> 29:32.479
CRISTELA:
This is sudden death,

29:32.519 --> 29:35.105
Legends of the Hidden Temple
style.

29:36.982 --> 29:39.067
JACKIE: I'm too short.
There's-- there's a point

29:39.109 --> 29:41.528
where I know I'm vertically
challenged, where I'm too short

29:41.570 --> 29:43.530
to catch those monkeys.
It has to come straight.

29:43.573 --> 29:45.532
CRISTELA: Both teams
are on their last monkey.

29:45.575 --> 29:48.076
They don't catch this one,
they have to reload.

29:49.788 --> 29:53.290
[slingshot booming]
[monkey screeching]

29:55.167 --> 29:57.002
-JOSH: Did it.
-Ooh! The Blue Barracudas

29:57.045 --> 29:59.547
got the last monkey. But he has
to bring the army back

29:59.588 --> 30:01.758
over the causeway
before they can hit their gong.

30:01.799 --> 30:03.259
EMMA: They got it.

30:03.300 --> 30:04.844
JOSH: Woo!

30:04.885 --> 30:07.180
-[gong echoes]
-Oh my God.

30:07.221 --> 30:08.847
Ahh!

30:08.890 --> 30:11.558
Ah...
Oh my God.

30:11.601 --> 30:13.394
[sighs]

30:13.769 --> 30:16.355
-I thought we were friends!
-[Cristela laughing]

30:16.396 --> 30:19.400
Josh and Nick,
congratulations!

30:19.442 --> 30:23.238
You have won
two Pendants of Life.

30:23.278 --> 30:25.365
It's twice as purty
as five minutes ago.

30:25.405 --> 30:28.492
-Here you go.
-Woo!

30:29.201 --> 30:33.205
You know, that means that you
are moving on to the Temple Run.

30:33.248 --> 30:35.333
Jackie, Emma,
you did a fantastic job.

30:35.375 --> 30:38.044
Unfortunately, you're not moving
forward, but you're not

30:38.086 --> 30:40.380
leaving empty handed.
Tell them what they won!

30:40.421 --> 30:43.298
ANNOUNCER: You've each won
an electric scooter from Razor!

30:43.340 --> 30:45.844
[cheering]

30:45.884 --> 30:48.429
ANNOUNCER: It's the EcoSmart
SUP electric scooter.

30:48.471 --> 30:50.682
A quiet ride
with a wide bamboo deck,

30:50.722 --> 30:53.142
twist grip throttle,
and pneumatic tire tubes.

30:53.183 --> 30:55.478
Goes up to 12 miles
on a single charge!

30:55.519 --> 30:58.314
Coming up next,
the Blue Barracudas will have

30:58.355 --> 31:01.401
a chance to run
Olmec's temple and retrieve

31:01.442 --> 31:04.903
the 10,000 year pearl necklace
of Rama,

31:04.945 --> 31:07.824
and a chance at $25,000.

31:07.865 --> 31:09.701
Stay
tuned. We'll be right back.

31:09.741 --> 31:12.077
NICK: Woo!

31:15.414 --> 31:18.000
[cheering]

31:18.041 --> 31:20.920
Welcome back
to Legends of the Hidden Temple.

31:20.961 --> 31:23.631
Nick and Josh have
proven themselves worthy

31:23.673 --> 31:26.925
and have earned the right
to enter Olmec's Temple again.

31:26.968 --> 31:28.845
We were on the show before,

31:28.886 --> 31:30.805
and it's been 28
years since that day.

31:30.846 --> 31:33.098
-HOST: Green Monkeys.
-JOSH: Justinian Code?

31:33.141 --> 31:34.976
-OLMEC: That is correct.
-There you go, Green Monkeys.

31:35.018 --> 31:37.311
Step down
and join the Red Jaguars.

31:37.979 --> 31:40.440
-On the right over here we have?
-Nick.

31:40.480 --> 31:42.442
Now, I heard you like
to write comedy skits?

31:42.482 --> 31:44.818
Yeah, um, I like
to do them and then

31:44.861 --> 31:46.653
enter them
into contests and stuff.

31:46.695 --> 31:48.906
I don't have the best
experience with Temple guards.

31:48.948 --> 31:51.617
For the last almost 30 years,
I've kind of been known

31:51.659 --> 31:54.996
as the guy who's jumped out
of the Temple by being scared.

31:55.038 --> 31:56.955
You know,
not every day it's relived,

31:56.998 --> 31:59.000
but it's definitely
an often thought that we would

31:59.041 --> 32:01.251
prevail in the Temple,
unlike our first attempt.

32:01.294 --> 32:03.796
NICK: It all comes down to this.
This is why we're here.

32:03.837 --> 32:07.090
This is what we came for.
It's another shot at doing it.

32:07.133 --> 32:10.178
I've been waiting for you two.

32:10.678 --> 32:14.015
Oh, I love it!
But before we let them loose

32:14.057 --> 32:16.893
to retrieve the 10,000
year pearl necklace from Rama,

32:16.934 --> 32:20.229
Olmec?
Tell us how the story ends.

32:20.980 --> 32:24.525
Rama and his monkey army
descend on Ravana's lair.

32:24.567 --> 32:27.612
But Ravana escapes
in his flying chariot.

32:27.653 --> 32:30.906
So, Rama gives chase,
and pierces his heart

32:30.949 --> 32:33.367
with divine
arrows that kill him.

32:33.409 --> 32:37.204
Rama frees Sita,
and Hanuman flies them all

32:37.246 --> 32:41.041
back home, where Rama
is finally crowned king.

32:41.084 --> 32:45.171
He gives Sita a pearl
necklace to replace the one

32:45.212 --> 32:47.256
she used as breadcrumbs,

32:47.298 --> 32:51.385
and they rule
together for 10,000 years.

32:51.426 --> 32:53.179
I love it.

32:53.221 --> 32:55.306
Rama had to fight
for years to gain control

32:55.347 --> 32:57.517
of his kingdom again.
And that's what we're doing now.

32:57.557 --> 32:59.394
Olmec, where's the necklace?

32:59.434 --> 33:02.689
The 10,000 year
pearl necklace of Rama

33:02.730 --> 33:07.067
may be found
in the Room of the Beloved.

33:07.986 --> 33:10.113
CRISTELA:
There are many challenges

33:10.153 --> 33:11.990
and locked
doors in Olmec's temple.

33:12.030 --> 33:14.616
They stand between
you and that pearl necklace.

33:14.659 --> 33:16.661
So, before Olmec
opens his gate,

33:16.702 --> 33:19.079
he's going to give you some
information that will help you

33:19.122 --> 33:20.789
make your way
through the temple.

33:20.832 --> 33:24.042
Your temple run
to the Room of the Beloved

33:24.085 --> 33:26.546
begins in the Crystal Cenote,

33:26.586 --> 33:29.632
where only one
of three doors will open.

33:29.673 --> 33:34.679
The lower door could lead you
to the Crypt of the Heartless.

33:34.721 --> 33:37.390
Reach into
the rotting corpses until

33:37.432 --> 33:39.683
you find the beating heart.

33:39.726 --> 33:42.519
Place the bloody
organ into the chamber

33:42.561 --> 33:46.773
to open the door
to the Pit of Despair,

33:46.816 --> 33:50.444
where only
one of three doors opens.

33:50.486 --> 33:55.032
Climb the bony walls
and enter the Spider's Lair,

33:55.074 --> 33:58.952
or crawl across
the rubble to the Dark Forest.

33:59.453 --> 34:02.457
Race through the trees
and punch through the rock wall

34:02.498 --> 34:05.375
to the Ladder of Death.

34:05.417 --> 34:08.463
Climb up
to the Queen's Armory,

34:08.503 --> 34:12.507
dress the queen for battle
in five pieces of magic armor.

34:12.550 --> 34:16.679
She may open
the gate to the Steamy Hollows

34:16.721 --> 34:21.016
or the door to the Room
of the Lost Treasure.

34:21.059 --> 34:23.186
Remove the rods,
dropping refuse on

34:23.226 --> 34:26.188
the floor
in search of a jade stone.

34:26.230 --> 34:29.400
Return it to its pedestal
to open the gate

34:29.442 --> 34:33.070
to the Shrine
of the Silver Monkey.

34:33.112 --> 34:36.782
Assemble that damn statue,
if you can,

34:36.824 --> 34:41.161
and open the passageway to
the Room of the Beloved,

34:41.204 --> 34:43.289
where you may finally grab

34:43.331 --> 34:46.958
the 10,000 year
pearl necklace of Rama.

34:47.001 --> 34:50.088
All of the doors
will instantly unlock,

34:50.128 --> 34:52.422
and the temple
guards will vanish.

34:52.465 --> 34:55.592
Race back through
the Crystal Cenote and through

34:55.635 --> 34:58.762
the temple gates
before time runs out.

34:58.804 --> 35:03.184
The choices are yours
and yours alone.

35:04.434 --> 35:06.436
Who is going first?

35:06.478 --> 35:10.190
-I am.
-Very well, Nick.

35:10.690 --> 35:14.653
Hiding inside the temple
are three temple guards

35:14.695 --> 35:17.364
assigned to protect
three specific rooms.

35:17.405 --> 35:20.284
Get caught,
and you may trade your pendant

35:20.326 --> 35:22.744
for an
extra life and go on.

35:22.786 --> 35:26.164
But get caught a second time,
you will be without a pendant.

35:26.206 --> 35:28.251
You'll be taken
out of the temple,

35:28.291 --> 35:33.172
and it will be Josh's turn
to enter and try his luck.

35:33.213 --> 35:36.967
Return through the gates with
the necklace in four minutes,

35:37.009 --> 35:40.346
and you will both
be handsomely rewarded.

35:40.387 --> 35:42.389
And here's how!

35:42.431 --> 35:44.516
ANNOUNCER: Just for getting
into the temple gates,

35:44.559 --> 35:46.768
you have already won $2,500

35:46.811 --> 35:49.438
to a spending account
provided by Chime.

35:49.480 --> 35:51.690
Grab the pearl
necklace within four minutes,

35:51.731 --> 35:54.818
and your account
will increase to $10,000.

35:54.860 --> 35:57.028
-Whoa!
-Return through the gates with

35:57.070 --> 36:00.199
the 10,000 year pearl necklace
of Rama before time is up,

36:00.240 --> 36:03.452
and your account
will grow to $25,000.

36:03.494 --> 36:05.538
Woo!
We can do that!

36:05.579 --> 36:08.206
ANNOUNCER: All from
our good friends at Chime.

36:08.248 --> 36:11.376
Chime is an award
winning financial app

36:11.418 --> 36:13.795
and debit card used
by millions of Americans.

36:13.838 --> 36:16.548
Get started today at Chime.com.

36:17.550 --> 36:19.342
CRISTELA:
Put four minutes on the clock.

36:19.385 --> 36:22.471
Olmec, open your gate.

36:22.512 --> 36:25.641
[Olmec groans]

36:25.682 --> 36:30.146
Nick, on your mark...
get set... go!

36:30.188 --> 36:32.815
Get it, buddy! Get it, get it,
get it, get it, get it, get it!

36:32.856 --> 36:35.150
CRISTELA: Let's do it, Nick!
Let's do it, Nick!

36:37.320 --> 36:40.530
Nick is fast, going low
to the Crypt of the Heartless.

36:40.572 --> 36:42.617
He's looking
for the beating heart.

36:42.657 --> 36:45.702
-Oh no! Temple guard!
-JOSH: Give me that life!

36:45.744 --> 36:48.371
-Come on, my heartless friend!
-CRISTELA: His pendant is gone,

36:48.414 --> 36:50.708
Nick has to find that beating
heart to open the door.

36:50.750 --> 36:52.751
Ah, he's got it!

36:54.170 --> 36:56.630
The door is open
to the Pit of Despair.

36:56.672 --> 36:58.507
Good call to climb
up towards the necklace.

36:58.548 --> 37:00.717
Two choices: up top,
right to the Spiders Lair,

37:00.760 --> 37:02.344
or left to the Queens Armory.

37:02.385 --> 37:04.722
Come on, Nick. I believe in you.
I believe in you.

37:04.764 --> 37:06.681
Blue Barracudas.
Blue Barracudas.

37:06.724 --> 37:08.559
JOSH: You look good in those
shorts!

37:08.601 --> 37:10.811
Yes!
You've been here before!

37:12.063 --> 37:13.940
-[door clicking]
-The Spider's Lair is locked.

37:13.981 --> 37:16.858
The only other door up
top is to the Queen's Armory.

37:20.987 --> 37:23.365
Oh, no!
That's locked, too!

37:24.449 --> 37:26.911
Back down to the Dark Forest.

37:26.952 --> 37:29.413
Nice, nice!

37:29.454 --> 37:31.831
JOSH: All right,
go in that dark forest, baby.

37:31.873 --> 37:34.043
CRISTELA: Yes!
The dark forest is open.

37:35.628 --> 37:39.465
Hey, it's my old friend, Nick!
He likes to write comedy skits.

37:39.507 --> 37:43.677
CRISTELA: Wait, what?
Yes! That's Kirk Fogg. Hi Kirk!

37:43.719 --> 37:45.972
I wonder how long he
has even been in there.

37:46.012 --> 37:48.891
-Keep going. You're doing great!
-Here's Kirk Fogg.

37:48.932 --> 37:51.601
This is the coolest
thing I could ever imagine.

37:51.643 --> 37:54.855
At this point, whatever, calling
it, this is just too cool.

37:57.275 --> 37:59.485
CRISTELA: Up to the Queen's
Armory-- [laughs]

37:59.527 --> 38:02.280
I'm still laughing
about Kirk Fogg. Love you, Kirk!

38:02.320 --> 38:06.534
Nick has to dress the queen
in five pieces of magic armor.

38:06.574 --> 38:10.204
Three more pieces.
This room is so stressful.

38:11.539 --> 38:13.039
JOSH:
Get that ankle bracelet,

38:13.081 --> 38:14.875
you're used
to that with your pass!

38:18.753 --> 38:21.298
CRISTELA: Just the headdress
and the necklace.

38:22.757 --> 38:24.844
JOSH: You got to put
it on her head though, bud.

38:25.344 --> 38:27.471
-Ahh!
-Come on, Nick, come on!

38:27.512 --> 38:29.889
You got this, you got this,
you got this! Two minutes left.

38:29.931 --> 38:31.934
Clasping a necklace
is hard to do when you're not

38:31.976 --> 38:34.519
in a hurry, and no
temple guards to worry about.

38:36.813 --> 38:39.108
-JOSH: And what the heck-- Yup.
-CRISTELA: Yes. You got it.

38:39.150 --> 38:40.693
That's it!
The door is open

38:40.735 --> 38:43.070
to the Room of the
Lost Treasure. Climb up!

38:44.070 --> 38:46.324
-[temple guard screaming]
-Temple guard!

38:46.364 --> 38:48.199
[Nick yells]

38:53.706 --> 38:55.458
Climb up!

38:58.126 --> 39:00.628
The door is open to the Room
of the Lost Treasure.

39:00.670 --> 39:03.132
-[temple guard screaming]
-Temple Guard!

39:03.173 --> 39:05.467
Alright, you got to go in!
Josh has just over

39:05.509 --> 39:07.427
a minute and a half
to grab the pearl necklace

39:07.469 --> 39:09.012
and get it out of
the temple.

39:09.054 --> 39:11.724
He's re-tracing Nick's path.

39:12.224 --> 39:14.851
I wonder if Kirk
is still in the Dark Forest.

39:15.811 --> 39:18.938
Don't let fanboy small talk
slow you down, Josh!

39:18.981 --> 39:21.858
KIRK: It's Josh. Josh, you're
doing great--

39:21.900 --> 39:25.570
-Keep going! I love it!
-JOSH: I love you, Kirk!

39:25.612 --> 39:28.574
KIRK: Your favorite room is
the Shrine to the Silver Monkey!

39:28.615 --> 39:31.077
This is one of the rare
situations where it's not creepy

39:31.117 --> 39:33.661
to find Kirk Fogg in
a Dark Forest waiting for you.

39:36.164 --> 39:38.166
CRISTELA: He's back in the
Room with the Lost Treasure,

39:38.208 --> 39:40.210
so close to the pearl necklace.

39:40.251 --> 39:42.713
Josh has to remove the rods
to find the jade stone.

39:42.755 --> 39:46.717
The stone is wrapped in burr.
Come on, Josh! Go, go, go!

39:46.759 --> 39:50.262
[clattering]

39:53.849 --> 39:55.518
Oh, yeah.

39:55.559 --> 39:57.769
CRISTELA:
Oh, yes, you got it! You got it!

39:57.811 --> 40:00.523
[gate thudding]

40:00.563 --> 40:02.983
The gate is open to the Shrine
of the Silver Monkey,

40:03.025 --> 40:05.152
one room from the necklace.

40:05.193 --> 40:07.987
Thirty seconds
to assemble the statue!

40:11.742 --> 40:14.327
Do it! He's got it!
He's got it, ah!

40:19.208 --> 40:22.210
Good! Open!
15 seconds.

40:26.632 --> 40:28.509
There it is!
That's 10 grand.

40:28.550 --> 40:30.510
He has nine seconds
to get out of the temple.

40:30.552 --> 40:36.724
Five, four, three, two, one!

40:36.766 --> 40:40.061
Oh no! No!

40:40.103 --> 40:44.190
No! Oh, man, come on over.

40:44.233 --> 40:46.568
Come on, Nick.
Come on over here, Josh.

40:47.068 --> 40:49.447
This means everything
to be here with my best friend.

40:49.487 --> 40:51.782
Share these memories now.
We used to have our own

40:51.824 --> 40:54.452
individual Legends memories.
Now we have a shared one.

40:54.492 --> 40:57.163
-You did great.
-I'm good. Dream come true.

40:57.204 --> 40:58.956
Oh, and Kirk Fogg?
Jeez.

40:59.373 --> 41:01.375
I love that you stopped--
You actually stopped

41:01.416 --> 41:03.960
to shake hands with Kirk.
[laughs]

41:04.003 --> 41:05.588
I had to listen to him.
Show that respect.

41:05.628 --> 41:07.255
-Oh, my God.
-You did!

41:07.297 --> 41:09.425
That shows you
that you guys are OG'S.

41:09.467 --> 41:11.552
You conquered the moat.

41:12.969 --> 41:15.014
First down
the Steps of Knowledge,

41:15.054 --> 41:17.432
dominated the temple games.

41:17.474 --> 41:20.186
You definitely proved
yourselves worthy of entering

41:20.226 --> 41:22.271
Olmec's Temple,
grabbing the pearl necklace

41:22.313 --> 41:24.315
with nine seconds to spare.

41:24.356 --> 41:26.483
You are heroes.

41:26.525 --> 41:31.237
You are going home
with $10,000 provided by Chime.

41:31.280 --> 41:33.239
This was so much fun
and we are,

41:33.282 --> 41:35.909
I think at this point,
the only two guys

41:35.951 --> 41:38.119
in the world who have
gotten to run both temples.

41:38.161 --> 41:40.079
Winning at this point,
to me, it's--

41:40.121 --> 41:42.248
To be honest,
it's icing on the cake.

41:42.291 --> 41:44.710
I'm Cristela Alonzo.
Join us next time for more

41:44.751 --> 41:47.378
Legends of the Hidden Temple!
Olmec!

41:47.880 --> 41:49.882
You ready to get out of here?

41:49.923 --> 41:53.885
OLMEC: I can't. I've got to call
my uncle, the Sphinx.

41:53.927 --> 41:56.054
