00:02.450 --> 00:03.313
<i>Previously on</i> The Company You Keep...

00:03.313 --> 00:05.005
So what do you do?

00:05.005 --> 00:06.178
I'm a yoga instructor.

00:06.178 --> 00:08.318
- You?
- Oh, me? Pageant queen

00:08.318 --> 00:09.871
<i>- turned rocket scientist.
- Mm.</i>

00:09.871 --> 00:11.321
<i>My son
was impressed with your offer.</i>

00:11.321 --> 00:13.875
How did you say you and Connor
came to know one another?

00:13.875 --> 00:15.015
Oh, I didn't.

00:15.015 --> 00:16.775
I can't believe
we pulled that off.

00:16.775 --> 00:18.328
- Did you get it?
- Of course I got it.

00:18.328 --> 00:20.020
I'm thinking we keep these
for the honeymoon.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.159
Can you hand me
the cold wallet?

00:22.263 --> 00:24.058
She lied to me
about who she was.

00:27.751 --> 00:30.547
<i>Maybe we just
stay here, do this.</i>

00:30.547 --> 00:32.377
<i>Fantasy is one thing, Charlie.</i>

00:32.377 --> 00:33.619
Reality is another.

00:33.619 --> 00:34.965
I want to take you
on that date.

00:34.965 --> 00:36.381
<i>Daphne Finch.</i>

00:36.381 --> 00:38.279
<i>Maguire brought her in
as a kind of consultant.</i>

00:38.279 --> 00:39.936
You owe us
the 10 million you stole

00:39.936 --> 00:41.282
<i>plus an additional 5.</i>

00:41.282 --> 00:42.973
<i>Let's call it the cost
of getting Mr. Maguire</i>

00:42.973 --> 00:44.182
<i>out of prison.</i>

00:44.182 --> 00:46.046
<i>Get to stealing, Charlie.</i>

00:49.601 --> 00:51.258
Let's start
the bidding at 100,000.

00:51.258 --> 00:53.398
Do I have 100,000? 100,000.

00:53.398 --> 00:54.778
Okay, team, this place

00:54.778 --> 00:57.298
is practically swimming
with marks.

00:57.298 --> 00:59.300
First one to find one
gets a drink on me.

00:59.300 --> 01:01.647
<i>We own a bar, Charlie.
Nice try.</i>

01:01.647 --> 01:03.787
160,000. Going once.

01:04.409 --> 01:06.273
Got your eyes on anyone?

01:06.273 --> 01:08.240
Bidder next to me
says he works

01:08.240 --> 01:10.794
for the Malaysian
advancement fund.

01:10.794 --> 01:12.106
<i>That's interesting.</i>

01:12.106 --> 01:13.832
Just talked
to the guy's driver.

01:13.832 --> 01:15.799
Says his boss
is flying to the Maldives

01:15.799 --> 01:17.077
later this afternoon.

01:17.077 --> 01:18.457
<i>Wonder what he likes better,</i>

01:18.457 --> 01:20.804
the beaches or their
non-extradition policy.

01:20.804 --> 01:23.393
He also hasn't bid
on a single item.

01:23.393 --> 01:26.155
My guess is, he's waiting
for the big showstopper.

01:26.155 --> 01:27.742
Same goes
for the guy on your left.

01:27.742 --> 01:31.643
Hey, Bird, what's the story
on paddle 362?

01:31.643 --> 01:35.164
Well, whoever he is,
he checked in under an alias.

01:35.164 --> 01:37.994
Probably because he works
for the Sinaloa cartel.

01:37.994 --> 01:39.651
We're knocking off
cartels now?

01:39.651 --> 01:42.309
Well, as long as we're
in the hole for 15 million.

01:42.309 --> 01:44.794
Hey, guys, stealing
for other people sucks.

01:44.794 --> 01:50.282

<i>to tapping me

01:53.630 --> 01:54.700
Yeah, I'm on it.

01:59.602 --> 02:01.328
He looks pissed.

02:01.845 --> 02:02.915

02:19.208 --> 02:20.968
You all right there, pal?

02:20.968 --> 02:23.039

their dog, Duchess, around.

02:23.039 --> 02:24.489
Didn't want her
to get on my ass

02:24.489 --> 02:26.284
for being covered in slobber.

02:26.284 --> 02:28.078
- Who's your boss?
- Name's Ellsworth.

02:28.078 --> 02:29.770
Real pair of peacocks,
those two.

02:30.529 --> 02:32.635
Next up, our final lot:

02:32.635 --> 02:35.327
a black diamond necklace
rumored to have belonged

02:35.327 --> 02:36.570
to the Romanovs.

02:36.570 --> 02:38.917
Our starting bid is 300,000.

02:38.917 --> 02:40.539
Do I have 300,000?

02:40.539 --> 02:43.059
300,000. 300,000.

02:43.059 --> 02:44.923
How about 325,000?

02:44.923 --> 02:47.201
325,000.

02:47.201 --> 02:49.203
Can you surprise me
with 350,000?

02:49.203 --> 02:50.549
350,000.

02:50.549 --> 02:52.033
<i>I can't stand the suspense.</i>

02:52.033 --> 02:53.483
<i>Which one of these crooks
are we gonna rob?</i>

02:53.483 --> 02:56.072
We got 375,000.

02:56.072 --> 02:57.936
Can you beat that
with 400,000?

02:57.936 --> 02:59.834
400,000.

02:59.834 --> 03:01.836
Going once.
Going twice.

03:01.836 --> 03:03.183
500,000.

03:04.839 --> 03:06.841
The bid was 425,000.

03:08.602 --> 03:10.086
But for you, it's a bargain.

03:11.605 --> 03:13.400
Sold for half a million even.

03:14.953 --> 03:16.920
<i>Oh, that's weird.</i>

03:16.920 --> 03:19.854
So the funds are being wired
into a numbered shell corp.

03:19.854 --> 03:21.270
Why is that weird?

03:21.270 --> 03:22.512
Because the name
of the company

03:22.512 --> 03:23.858
is Duchess Incorporated.

03:23.858 --> 03:25.722
Isn't that the name
of their dog?

03:26.482 --> 03:28.794
So the buyer and the seller
are the same person,

03:28.794 --> 03:31.797
Claude Ellsworth,
former ambassador to Russia.

03:31.797 --> 03:36.146
And before that,
he made a mint in the oil biz.

03:36.146 --> 03:37.803
There's only one reason
a guy sells himself

03:37.803 --> 03:39.736
a necklace he already owns.

03:39.736 --> 03:41.773
- To launder it.
- Bingo.

03:41.773 --> 03:44.154
Well, it's probably
a kickback from the Kremlin.

03:44.154 --> 03:46.226
It says here
that Ellsworth helped lift

03:46.226 --> 03:47.986
Russian energy sanctions.

03:50.609 --> 03:52.956
- That's our corrupt buyer?
- Oh, come on.

03:52.956 --> 03:55.718
Don't judge a crook
by their cover, Mom.

04:08.593 --> 04:09.973
<i>They're holding you here</i>

04:09.973 --> 04:12.286
<i>on some old weapons charge
because they know</i>

04:12.286 --> 04:14.461
they can't make
a RICO case stick.

04:15.116 --> 04:16.601
Care to know
what I ate for breakfast?

04:16.601 --> 04:18.948
It is only a matter of time
before they--

04:18.948 --> 04:21.847
Boiled eggs
and powdered milk.

04:21.847 --> 04:24.988
But it's not just me that's
lacking in nourishment, is it?

04:24.988 --> 04:27.163
There's the matter
of our revenue stream,

04:27.163 --> 04:29.752
all dried up
now that we're down 10 million,

04:29.752 --> 04:31.132
with no distribution hub.

04:31.132 --> 04:33.134
Yes, I am aware.
And I--

04:33.134 --> 04:34.826
There's also
the matter of our rivals,

04:34.826 --> 04:37.138
who now know
we're on the FBI's radar

04:37.138 --> 04:38.692
and God knows who else's.

04:38.692 --> 04:40.797
So we use that
to our advantage.

04:40.797 --> 04:43.455
Lure our enemies out by making
ourselves look vulnerable.

04:43.455 --> 04:44.836
We are vulnerable.

04:46.182 --> 04:47.942
Maybe I should call in Connor.

04:47.942 --> 04:49.219
Maybe you should.

04:49.875 --> 04:51.049
Need I remind you

04:51.049 --> 04:52.809
he is the reason
you're in here?

04:52.809 --> 04:55.329
Perhaps if your son
spent less time in the gym

04:55.329 --> 04:57.607
and more time vetting
that warehouse deal--

04:57.607 --> 04:59.299
It was Connor's deal,

04:59.299 --> 05:01.611
but it was all part
of your grand plan.

05:01.611 --> 05:02.992
Then let me see it through.

05:02.992 --> 05:05.339
I will figure out a way
to keep the lights on

05:05.339 --> 05:08.446
and platform our expansion.

05:16.557 --> 05:18.490
Maguire met his lawyer.
So what?

05:19.353 --> 05:20.837
She's not his lawyer.

05:20.837 --> 05:22.805
This Daphne woman
knows we're watching,

05:22.805 --> 05:24.047
which is why
she's using the veil

05:24.047 --> 05:25.463
of attorney-client privilege

05:25.463 --> 05:26.705
to conspire with him.

05:26.705 --> 05:28.707
Sounds speculative.

05:28.707 --> 05:29.984
Deductive, actually.

05:29.984 --> 05:31.331
Well, last I checked,

05:31.331 --> 05:32.711
Connor Maguire
is the heir apparent,

05:32.711 --> 05:34.403
- and he's--
- Back in Belfast, I know.

05:34.403 --> 05:36.059
Which means the Maguires
are no longer pursuing

05:36.059 --> 05:37.647
their East Coast expansion.

05:37.647 --> 05:39.097
That's what they want us
to think.

05:39.097 --> 05:40.823
The fact that
this Daphne woman's

05:40.823 --> 05:42.894
still in town says otherwise.

05:42.894 --> 05:44.344
Get me coverage on her hotel,

05:44.344 --> 05:46.000
and I'll prove
they're playing possum.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.555
You want to plant a bug
on a U.S. citizen

05:48.555 --> 05:51.558
with no record
and two Ivy League degrees?

05:51.558 --> 05:53.663
A U.S. citizen
who's risen the ranks

05:53.663 --> 05:55.700
of a transnational
crime syndicate.

05:58.634 --> 06:00.290
Is that a yes?

06:00.981 --> 06:03.328
What, like you were gonna
take no for an answer?

06:07.056 --> 06:09.369
The woman doesn't take
a bad photo, does she?

06:10.473 --> 06:12.302
So we working late
tonight or what?

06:12.302 --> 06:14.270
Why, you got another hot date?

06:14.270 --> 06:16.410
No.
But apparently you do.

06:17.446 --> 06:19.309
Auto-reminder
popped up on your screen:

06:19.309 --> 06:21.173
reservation at Chez Marcel.

06:23.969 --> 06:25.281
Oh, okay.

06:25.281 --> 06:26.420
Do tell.

06:26.420 --> 06:27.456
First date?

06:28.353 --> 06:30.286
Technically, yes.

06:30.286 --> 06:33.047
But also no.
It's... complicated.

06:33.047 --> 06:35.981
Wait, is this the guy
you hooked up with after Kevin?

06:35.981 --> 06:37.327
Wow.

06:37.327 --> 06:38.674
Good for you.

06:39.502 --> 06:40.986
What do you mean,
good for me?

06:41.504 --> 06:42.954
For dating your rebound.

06:42.954 --> 06:44.990
I think it's really brave, girl.

06:57.658 --> 06:59.142
Sure you don't want
that drink?

06:59.142 --> 07:01.248
Still fine, thanks.

07:01.248 --> 07:02.422
But, uh, you might want

07:02.422 --> 07:03.768
to get that guy
another gin and tonic,

07:03.768 --> 07:05.321
because she's about
to dump him.

07:05.321 --> 07:06.633
Thanks.

07:20.370 --> 07:21.820
Giving up on me already?

07:22.856 --> 07:25.134
Hey. Hey.

07:27.343 --> 07:28.482
I didn't hear from you.

07:28.482 --> 07:30.277
I know. I'm late.

07:30.277 --> 07:32.003
I was at work with my family.

07:32.693 --> 07:34.143
It won't happen again.

07:35.972 --> 07:37.146
Please.

07:37.905 --> 07:39.217
Everything okay
with your family?

07:39.217 --> 07:41.633
Yeah.
You know, just some...

07:41.633 --> 07:42.841
Work stuff.

07:42.841 --> 07:44.671
Oh. You guys run a bar
together, right?

07:44.671 --> 07:46.983
- Yeah.
- That must be a lot.

07:47.846 --> 07:49.123
How do you mean?

07:49.123 --> 07:51.056
Mixing family and business?

07:51.056 --> 07:53.507
Not always the best cocktail,
at least where I'm from.

07:53.507 --> 07:56.855
Yeah, it, um,
gets messy sometimes.

07:56.855 --> 07:58.443
Hmm.

07:59.720 --> 08:00.790
What about you?

08:00.790 --> 08:02.551
I don't think I ever got
a straight answer

08:02.551 --> 08:04.311
about what it is
you do for a living.

08:04.311 --> 08:05.726
You didn't?

08:05.726 --> 08:07.141
I didn't.

08:07.141 --> 08:10.973
Um, I'm a data analyst
at a logistics firm.

08:10.973 --> 08:12.492
- It's more exciting than it--
- What exactly--

08:12.492 --> 08:14.148
- Hmm?
- Go ahead.

08:14.148 --> 08:15.495
No, no, please.

08:15.495 --> 08:17.980
I don't know
exactly what that is,

08:17.980 --> 08:21.501
but, um, is that something
you always wanted to do?

08:21.501 --> 08:23.054
Mm, not really.

08:23.054 --> 08:26.920
Uh, I got recruited,
actually, after Stanford.

08:26.920 --> 08:29.405
Wow, Stanford.
Big shot.

08:29.405 --> 08:31.821
Where did you go?
To college, I mean.

08:31.821 --> 08:34.203
Uh, I didn't.

08:43.453 --> 08:45.455
- This is weird.
- Super weird.

08:45.455 --> 08:48.251
You know, on the plus side,
at least we're not those two.

08:54.810 --> 08:56.121
He just got dumped.

08:56.121 --> 08:57.398
- Mm.
- Mm.

08:57.398 --> 08:59.677
She said she needs
to find herself,

08:59.677 --> 09:02.300
but really, she's just bored.

09:02.300 --> 09:03.473
It's a neat trick.

09:03.473 --> 09:05.234
I like to people-watch.

09:05.234 --> 09:06.684
And, well--

09:06.684 --> 09:08.133
Kept you waiting.

09:08.133 --> 09:10.550
Yeah, you did.

09:17.729 --> 09:19.213

It's... my brother.

10:04.017 --> 10:05.777
Handsome guy.

10:06.640 --> 10:08.815
U.S. Senate, huh?

10:08.815 --> 10:12.128
Yeah, he's running
for my dad's old seat.

10:12.128 --> 10:14.648
Wow.

10:14.648 --> 10:16.650
How do they feel about you
slumming it with a bartender?

10:27.661 --> 10:30.353
Hey, you, um--

10:30.353 --> 10:32.562
rain check?

10:32.562 --> 10:34.150
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

10:44.989 --> 10:46.335
Who are you?

10:46.335 --> 10:49.683
I'm Emma.
I...live here.

10:49.683 --> 10:51.651
- Who are you?
- Oh.

10:51.651 --> 10:54.170
I'm David's
new campaign manager, Doug.

10:54.170 --> 10:56.138
- Don't worry. She's not a spy.
- Ah.

10:56.138 --> 10:58.209
- Pizza?
- Yeah.

10:58.209 --> 10:59.693
I'm starving.

10:59.693 --> 11:01.557
Emma, darling,
where have you been?

11:01.557 --> 11:02.731
It's almost 10:00.

11:02.731 --> 11:04.249
Uh, you know what they say:

11:04.249 --> 11:05.699
logistics never sleep.

11:05.699 --> 11:07.667
One day, you're
gonna have to explain to me

11:07.667 --> 11:09.254
what it is you actually do.

11:09.772 --> 11:11.325
What's going on?
Everything okay?

11:11.325 --> 11:12.810
My poll numbers just came in.

11:12.810 --> 11:14.570
So you're throwing
a pizza party?

11:14.570 --> 11:15.985
Small bump in the road.

11:15.985 --> 11:17.193
That's all.

11:17.193 --> 11:19.437
Seems I'm underperforming
in the Seattle suburbs.

11:19.437 --> 11:21.059
It's because he's unmarried.

11:21.059 --> 11:23.061
No one trusts
a senator who is single.

11:23.061 --> 11:24.684
Sorry, Mom.
I'll see what I can do

11:24.684 --> 11:26.686
about finding a wife and kids
before the election.

11:29.412 --> 11:30.759
I haven't seen
your mother like this

11:30.759 --> 11:32.588
since I ran for city council.

11:32.588 --> 11:35.177
I suppose you picked
a tough time to move back home.

11:35.177 --> 11:38.076
Is there ever an easy time
for a 35-year-old

11:38.076 --> 11:39.629
to move back in
with her parents?

11:39.629 --> 11:41.286
Sounds rhetorical.
Not touching it.

11:42.874 --> 11:45.981
Look, I'm just happy
you're here.

11:47.983 --> 11:49.260
Me too.

11:49.260 --> 11:52.228
And in a way,
this is how I think of home.

11:52.228 --> 11:55.197
Every six years, a hurricane
blew through our lives.

11:55.197 --> 11:56.474
Yeah.

11:56.474 --> 11:57.786
Hurricane Grace.

11:57.786 --> 12:00.892
This is a critical moment for...

12:00.892 --> 12:03.653
<i>♪ To all the women</i>

12:03.653 --> 12:05.138
Here you go, my dear.

12:05.138 --> 12:07.071
I'll take a mojito.

12:12.110 --> 12:15.389
Well... we don't serve mojitos.

12:20.498 --> 12:22.293
Easy, Bird.

12:24.502 --> 12:25.537
I got it, Bird.

12:26.711 --> 12:28.299
Yeah.

12:31.820 --> 12:33.131
Sign language.

12:34.512 --> 12:35.996
That's not necessary.

12:36.790 --> 12:38.309
Well, I just wanted
to make sure

12:38.309 --> 12:39.931
I was being understood.

12:39.931 --> 12:44.487
After all, 15 million
is a lot of money.

12:44.487 --> 12:45.765
Hey, we're figuring that out.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.974
- When and how much?
- Couple weeks.

12:47.974 --> 12:50.010
Working on a score right now
that should...

12:50.010 --> 12:51.460
put a pretty healthy dent
in the debt.

12:51.460 --> 12:54.014
I'd say mid-six figures.

12:54.014 --> 12:57.052
You have three days
to make your first payment.

12:58.674 --> 13:00.503
Look, I'm not
getting myself

13:00.503 --> 13:02.505
or my family picked up
just to make good

13:02.505 --> 13:04.922
on your payment schedule.

13:04.922 --> 13:06.820
Hmm.

13:06.820 --> 13:10.306
Try explaining that to
Patrick Maguire's son, Connor.

13:10.306 --> 13:12.205
You remember,
the guy you ripped off

13:12.205 --> 13:14.690
whose father is now locked up,
thanks to you?

13:15.415 --> 13:18.383
Get me my money
by the end of the week,

13:18.383 --> 13:21.662
or I'm calling Connor
to help collect.

13:33.536 --> 13:35.676
Well, breaking
into the house is easy.

13:35.676 --> 13:36.954
Breaking into this thing--

13:36.954 --> 13:38.956
Wait, Pop,
how did you get the schematics

13:38.956 --> 13:40.509
to the ambassador's safe?

13:40.509 --> 13:42.511
Stas works for the company
that installed it.

13:42.511 --> 13:44.996
- Who's Stas?
- Stas?

13:44.996 --> 13:46.342
He's an old friend of your dad.

13:46.342 --> 13:47.757
We worked together
back at the steel mill.

13:47.757 --> 13:49.863
I always loved Stas.
He's so sweet.

13:49.863 --> 13:51.002
I don't suppose
he happened to give you

13:51.002 --> 13:52.038
the code for the safe?

13:52.038 --> 13:53.522
I wish.

13:53.522 --> 13:56.490
It's biometric, opened only
with the owner's thumbprint.

13:56.490 --> 13:57.664
You know what?
I bet Stas would give us

13:57.664 --> 13:59.355
a thumb, too, if we asked.

14:00.011 --> 14:01.668
That's Ma with the big ideas.

14:01.668 --> 14:02.772
We're not cutting off
anyone's thumb.

14:02.772 --> 14:03.981
Suit yourself.

14:03.981 --> 14:06.397
Wait, so we can't
get into the safe

14:06.397 --> 14:07.847
to steal the necklace.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.503
I mean, we're just gonna have
to flush it out.

14:09.503 --> 14:12.265
I think we pull
a modified green goods scam.

14:12.265 --> 14:14.267
Is three days enough time
for a job this big?

14:14.267 --> 14:16.372
It's not entirely impossible.

14:16.372 --> 14:17.615
Remember the cruise ship job?

14:17.615 --> 14:18.788
Ah.

14:18.788 --> 14:20.790
You know, at least
the extraction plan

14:20.790 --> 14:22.447
wouldn't involve swimming.

14:22.447 --> 14:24.449
You guys are never
gonna forgive me for forgetting

14:24.449 --> 14:26.727
to refuel those Jet Skis,
are you?

14:26.727 --> 14:28.108
- No.
- No. Absolutely not.

14:28.108 --> 14:29.454
Okay, okay, so--

14:29.454 --> 14:31.249
so how do we get
the Ellsworths

14:31.249 --> 14:33.113
to take their necklace
out of the safe?

14:33.113 --> 14:34.874
You prey on their vanity.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.392
<i>You guys saw those people.</i>

14:36.392 --> 14:38.187
<i>The only thing that they care
more about than money</i>

14:38.187 --> 14:39.464
<i>is their image.</i>

14:39.464 --> 14:41.811
You just gotta give them
an excuse to peacock.

14:41.811 --> 14:44.435
This sounds like
a job for Milos.

14:44.435 --> 14:46.126
- Thought we retired Milos.
- No.

14:46.126 --> 14:49.267
You retired Milos
because you were jealous.

14:49.267 --> 14:50.475
- Jealous?
- Yeah, jealous.

14:50.475 --> 14:52.753
Of you wanting to make
a fool of yourself?

14:52.753 --> 14:53.789
Oh, are you kidding me?

14:53.789 --> 14:55.308
Hey, guys,
how about we focus?

14:55.308 --> 14:56.792
- Yeah, sorry about that.
- Sorry, baby.

14:56.792 --> 14:59.691
You know, I don't entirely
hate Milos for this job.

15:01.176 --> 15:02.798
Charlie.

15:02.798 --> 15:04.627
Don't encourage him.

15:08.148 --> 15:09.943
<i>This early
in the election cycle...</i>

15:09.943 --> 15:11.048
Morning.

15:11.048 --> 15:12.463
Oh, no, honey.

15:12.463 --> 15:14.465
You gotta wear
something dressier than that.

15:14.465 --> 15:16.294
Why?
I'm headed to work.

15:16.294 --> 15:18.918
Well, sure, but right after
the photographer snaps

15:18.918 --> 15:21.403
a few family shots
for David's new campaign.

15:21.403 --> 15:22.645
Didn't you hear?

15:22.645 --> 15:23.819
Mom's rebranding us

15:23.819 --> 15:25.648
as the next great
political dynasty.

15:25.648 --> 15:27.305
We're the Asian American Kennedys.

15:27.305 --> 15:30.584
I prefer to think of them
as the Irish American Hills.

15:30.584 --> 15:31.931
That's good.

15:31.931 --> 15:34.209
Oh, we gotta remember
to put that in the memoir.

15:35.106 --> 15:36.314
Don't ask.

15:37.384 --> 15:40.836
Uh, while a photo shoot
sounds super fun,

15:40.836 --> 15:42.838
I'm not interested
in being a prop.

15:42.838 --> 15:45.013
We're all props, dear.
It's politics.

15:45.875 --> 15:47.877
You want me to help?
Fine.

15:47.877 --> 15:49.500
David doesn't have
a suburban problem.

15:49.500 --> 15:50.673
See these zip codes?

15:50.673 --> 15:52.468
They're all predominantly
Asian American.

15:52.468 --> 15:54.194
That jives
with our numbers on, uh,

15:54.194 --> 15:56.472
your authenticity factor.

15:56.472 --> 15:58.543
They don't think
I'm Asian enough?

15:58.543 --> 16:01.167
What if you wear a hanbok
for the photos?

16:01.167 --> 16:02.306
It's a little on the nose, Mom.

16:02.306 --> 16:03.721
The Kennedys
never wore kilts.

16:03.721 --> 16:05.792
I'm leaving.
You're welcome.

16:05.792 --> 16:07.311
The Kennedys
weren't Scottish.

16:09.313 --> 16:11.315
I don't like it, Charlie.

16:11.315 --> 16:13.282
The risks
that she's forcing us to take.

16:13.282 --> 16:14.663
Look, you don't
have to be a part of this

16:14.663 --> 16:15.836
if you don't want to.

16:15.836 --> 16:17.148
Paying Daphne back
is on me, all right?

16:17.148 --> 16:18.529
I messed that one up.

16:19.150 --> 16:20.358
You're such a drama queen.

16:20.358 --> 16:21.566
Just because I don't like it
does not mean

16:21.566 --> 16:23.189
I'm bailing on you.

16:23.189 --> 16:24.914
It's not like
you're the first Nicoletti

16:24.914 --> 16:26.226
to get blinded by love.

16:27.020 --> 16:28.366
At least you didn't marry Tina.

16:28.366 --> 16:30.368
At least Simon
didn't take us for 10 mil.

16:30.368 --> 16:32.336
I don't know,
Tina conned me too.

16:33.854 --> 16:35.477
I don't know,
I think I wanted, like,

16:35.477 --> 16:37.858
at least one of us to have
what Mom and Dad do.

16:37.858 --> 16:39.999
Yeah, it's annoying how high
they set the bar, huh?

16:39.999 --> 16:42.863
Well, you know,
at least we got each other.

16:43.933 --> 16:45.314
I mean, just
realistically speaking.

16:45.314 --> 16:46.729
- You think so?
- Yeah.

17:08.958 --> 17:10.788
- Kid's got skills.
- Don't.

17:14.274 --> 17:15.620
What's this?

17:15.620 --> 17:16.966
It's the hotel
where Daphne's staying.

17:16.966 --> 17:18.865
I followed her home.

17:18.865 --> 17:21.005
No one messes with my kid.

17:21.902 --> 17:23.283
So she knows
our vulnerabilities.

17:23.283 --> 17:24.802
It's only fair
we know hers, right?

17:24.802 --> 17:26.079
That's it right there.

17:26.838 --> 17:29.358
Hey... what happened to my scarf?

17:29.358 --> 17:32.085
Okay, I thought we said 3:00.

17:32.085 --> 17:33.811
Did you mean today, Milos?

17:33.811 --> 17:35.537
- Well, I'm here.
- I can get you in

17:35.537 --> 17:37.539
as soon as I'm through
with Mrs. Ellsworth.

17:37.539 --> 17:40.473
Lucky for you, Sandy,
those magical hands of yours

17:40.473 --> 17:42.095
are worth the wait.

17:42.095 --> 17:43.441
So I'll wait.

17:45.754 --> 17:47.963
- Oh, no.
- What?

17:47.963 --> 17:49.654
What is it?

17:50.862 --> 17:53.624
General Petraeus and his wife
just canceled.

17:53.624 --> 17:55.004
Food poisoning.

17:55.004 --> 17:57.386
And to think I could have been
at Fashion Week.

17:57.386 --> 17:58.836
What about the Obamas?

17:58.836 --> 18:01.494
- Out of town.
- The AG and his wife?

18:01.494 --> 18:03.151
I'd rather shoot
a bowl of dog food.

18:03.151 --> 18:04.773
Oh, God,
there must be someone.

18:04.773 --> 18:07.086
Who, a power couple
with a home worthy

18:07.086 --> 18:10.468
of an arts and style page
in less than 24 hours?

18:10.468 --> 18:11.814
I mean, I doubt it.

18:11.814 --> 18:13.782
I don't mean to eavesdrop,

18:13.782 --> 18:16.647
but I think I might know
of the perfect home:

18:16.647 --> 18:17.924
mine.

18:23.171 --> 18:24.655
Maintenance.

18:27.692 --> 18:29.625
Hey, how's that code coming?

18:30.799 --> 18:33.146
Just a second.

18:34.527 --> 18:36.149
Any luck?

18:44.192 --> 18:45.158
I'm in.

18:51.578 --> 18:53.615
How long ago did you say
she checked in?

18:53.615 --> 18:55.134
A week ago,
and housekeeping says

18:55.134 --> 18:57.032
Daphne hasn't let
anyone in since.

18:57.032 --> 18:58.344
You wouldn't know.

18:58.344 --> 19:00.069
Place is spotless.

19:00.069 --> 19:02.486
<i>God, this woman is a robot.</i>

19:18.018 --> 19:19.158
Clever.

19:20.228 --> 19:22.713
Clever, clever, clever.

19:28.753 --> 19:31.308
Location number six,
Wednesday, 9:00 a.m.

19:31.308 --> 19:32.723
Mr. C, location number--

19:32.723 --> 19:36.313
this whole thing is--
is encrypted.

19:36.313 --> 19:37.659
Disciplined and paranoid.

19:37.659 --> 19:39.212
That's perfect.

19:44.321 --> 19:46.737
Oh, hang on a minute.
Hang on a minute.

19:47.531 --> 19:48.877
Look at this.

19:50.603 --> 19:52.260
I'm sending you
something right now.

19:55.263 --> 19:56.609
<i>See a resemblance?</i>

19:56.609 --> 19:59.128
I'm guessing that's her mom.

19:59.128 --> 20:00.820
At least we know she's human.

20:03.478 --> 20:05.445
- She's here.
- What?

20:19.114 --> 20:21.150
<i>I'm in.
You copy?</i>

20:21.150 --> 20:22.635
I copy.

20:32.438 --> 20:33.922
<i>What's going on, Charlie?</i>

20:33.922 --> 20:36.165
Charlie.

21:31.151 --> 21:32.670
Housekeeping!

21:34.016 --> 21:35.984
Housekeeping.

21:38.331 --> 21:40.816
Okay, Charlie, get to the door
of the adjoining suite--now.

21:56.107 --> 21:57.005
<i>Where'd you rush off to?</i>

21:57.005 --> 21:58.558
<i>Second date?</i>

21:58.558 --> 22:01.147
Uh, we didn't eat,
so technically,

22:01.147 --> 22:02.735
it doesn't count as a date.

22:04.633 --> 22:06.566
Well, technically,
anything more than two dates

22:06.566 --> 22:09.258
means that you have to report
an external contact form.

22:09.258 --> 22:11.157
<i>Update your relationship status.</i>

22:12.538 --> 22:15.092
It's... not a relationship.

22:15.092 --> 22:17.094
<i>Company rules, not mine.</i>

22:17.094 --> 22:19.441
I don't know what it is.
It's--

22:20.580 --> 22:22.375
It's like you said.
It's a rebound.

22:22.375 --> 22:24.273
This is why I only have
one-night stands.

22:24.273 --> 22:25.654
<i>You don't want them
getting all clingy,</i>

22:25.654 --> 22:27.173
<i>asking you about your family,</i>

22:27.173 --> 22:28.657
<i>telling you their life story.</i>

22:32.212 --> 22:33.282
<i>Are you hearing me?</i>

22:34.111 --> 22:35.595
I'm hanging up now.

22:44.466 --> 22:45.985
Mm.

22:47.573 --> 22:48.919
Oh, boy.

22:48.919 --> 22:51.300
Didn't even make it
into the restaurant this time.

22:51.300 --> 22:53.510
See what happens
when you're on time?

22:53.510 --> 22:54.787
Yeah, eventually,
we're gonna have to upgrade

22:54.787 --> 22:56.513
to someplace with walls.

22:56.513 --> 22:59.619
Mm, gonna have to be
your place, 'cause...

22:59.619 --> 23:01.932
I live with my parents.

23:01.932 --> 23:03.727
Hey, how's that going,
by the way?

23:03.727 --> 23:07.282
I mean, living with your family
after being away for so long.

23:07.282 --> 23:09.733
It's, uh,
not without its challenges.

23:09.733 --> 23:11.459
Oh, yeah?
How so?

23:11.459 --> 23:13.392
Your folks anything like mine,

23:13.392 --> 23:16.602
made for each other,
stupid in love?

23:18.051 --> 23:20.709
Look, we don't need
to do this.

23:22.470 --> 23:24.333
What, do--

23:24.333 --> 23:25.473
do what?

23:25.473 --> 23:26.784
Put pressure on this

23:26.784 --> 23:28.579
to be anything more
than what it is.

23:30.305 --> 23:32.411
I'm sorry.
What is this?

23:33.481 --> 23:36.000
Two emotionally
unavailable people

23:36.000 --> 23:38.278
with a strong
physical connection

23:38.278 --> 23:39.728
clearly on the rebound.

23:44.146 --> 23:45.320
Come on, Charlie.

23:45.320 --> 23:47.184
We met and hooked up
within hours

23:47.184 --> 23:49.600
of our last relationships
blowing up.

23:49.600 --> 23:51.637
You don't think
this is all a bit fast?

23:51.637 --> 23:53.086
No, I--

23:53.086 --> 23:55.503
I think sometimes
you meet the right person

23:55.503 --> 23:56.745
at the wrong time.

23:56.745 --> 23:58.609
Where is all this coming from?

23:58.609 --> 24:00.300
I'm just calling it
like it is.

24:00.300 --> 24:02.579
No, I--I think you're
throwing a grenade into this

24:02.579 --> 24:03.683
because you're scared.

24:03.683 --> 24:05.029
Tell me I'm wrong.

24:06.237 --> 24:08.308
Believe me, I know that trick.

24:13.590 --> 24:16.662
I get that you think
you know me or whatever,

24:16.662 --> 24:18.249
but the truth is, you don't.

24:19.043 --> 24:20.769
Don't pretend like you do.

24:28.777 --> 24:30.814
<i>Okay, so step one:</i>

24:30.814 --> 24:32.401
<i>we infiltrate the Ellsworths</i>

24:32.401 --> 24:34.403
<i>by posing
as a photography crew.</i>

24:34.403 --> 24:36.440
There she is, my muse.

24:37.579 --> 24:39.339
Get her out of here, Ludwig,

24:39.339 --> 24:41.410
unless the whole world wants
to see us covered in slobber.

24:41.410 --> 24:43.171
<i>♪ Every time
I try to speak ♪</i>

24:43.171 --> 24:45.345
<i>♪ I want to tell you
that I dig you ♪</i>

24:47.002 --> 24:50.316
<i>♪ But every time I try</i>

24:50.316 --> 24:52.767
Milos,
we're losing the light.

24:54.078 --> 24:56.046
Right this way, madam.

24:56.046 --> 24:57.737
Now, if they're as vain
as we think they are,

24:57.737 --> 25:00.671
Mrs. Ellsworth will not be able
to resist wearing the necklace.

25:00.671 --> 25:04.848
Step two: intercept it
between her neck and the safe.

25:04.848 --> 25:06.815
Darling,
don't forget my necklace.

25:06.815 --> 25:09.197
Given what I paid,
how could I?

25:10.474 --> 25:12.545
<i>Now, Bird, you're
gonna be on hair and makeup.</i>

25:12.545 --> 25:13.926
<i>I want you to be the one
making the switch</i>

25:13.926 --> 25:15.859
<i>between the real necklace
and the ringer.</i>

25:17.481 --> 25:18.862
Here, let me.

25:18.862 --> 25:20.691
You'll have to excuse Ludwig,

25:20.691 --> 25:23.038
but I'm afraid
that no one's allowed

25:23.038 --> 25:24.764
- to touch the necklace but us.
- Ah.

25:24.764 --> 25:26.732
Insurance companies.

25:26.732 --> 25:28.319
- Such a bore.
- Mm-hmm.

25:58.142 --> 25:59.178
How's it going?

26:00.524 --> 26:02.043
Please tell me
you've got something.

26:02.043 --> 26:03.251
Judging by the tone
of your voice,

26:03.251 --> 26:04.942
I guess the date
didn't go well.

26:07.151 --> 26:08.567
Did you at least
get some action?

26:09.257 --> 26:10.327
What do we have?

26:11.190 --> 26:13.123
Uh, sadly, nothing.

26:13.123 --> 26:15.159
Not a single visitor
or phone call.

26:15.159 --> 26:17.092
It's weird, actually.

26:17.783 --> 26:18.991
What if Cas was right?

26:18.991 --> 26:20.509
Maybe they really have
gone dark.

26:20.509 --> 26:22.719
Maybe she's just here
tying up loose ends.

26:22.719 --> 26:24.272
Yeah, 'cause the only crime
I'm seeing is someone

26:24.272 --> 26:26.654
as good-looking as this woman
with zero life.

26:28.932 --> 26:30.658
She's objectively attractive.

26:32.211 --> 26:34.316
Emma, you've got
a code green.

26:34.316 --> 26:35.835
What?

26:35.835 --> 26:37.768
Your brother.
He's in the lobby.

26:43.705 --> 26:45.465
David, what a surprise.

26:45.465 --> 26:47.606
You should have called.
I could have met you somewhere.

26:47.606 --> 26:50.539
I realized yesterday
I've never visited you at work.

26:52.645 --> 26:53.784
Thank you for the coffee.

26:53.784 --> 26:55.959
It's just,
I've got this project,

26:55.959 --> 26:57.477
and now's really not
a good time.

26:57.477 --> 27:00.135
Okay, yeah, I'll take off.
I just--

27:00.135 --> 27:02.344
you know, I wanted
to talk to you about, um...

27:03.967 --> 27:06.486
Would you ever consider
coming to work on my campaign?

27:07.867 --> 27:08.972
What?

27:08.972 --> 27:10.387
We need a new
campaign strategist,

27:10.387 --> 27:11.802
and the way
you cut through the noise

27:11.802 --> 27:13.701
on my polling numbers,

27:13.701 --> 27:14.840
I thought...

27:15.737 --> 27:18.395
David, I'm honored, but I--

27:18.395 --> 27:22.192
Just... think about it, okay?

27:23.711 --> 27:25.920
I'll think about it.
I promise.

27:27.680 --> 27:28.923
Thank you for the coffee.

27:29.717 --> 27:31.063
Good luck on that project.

27:37.069 --> 27:38.346
Okay.

27:38.346 --> 27:40.210
So how do we steal
a necklace we can't touch?

27:40.210 --> 27:42.661
- Uh, not the way we planned.
- Yes, yes.

27:42.661 --> 27:44.145
Is it time
to cut off his thumb?

27:44.145 --> 27:47.217
No, no, no, no,
just... new plan.

27:47.217 --> 27:49.253
- Catalina Jewel.
- Yeah, oldie but a goodie.

27:49.253 --> 27:51.324
- Yeah.
- Yes, yes. Chin down.

27:51.324 --> 27:52.740
Oh, yes.

27:52.740 --> 27:53.913
Give me the ringer.

27:53.913 --> 27:55.535
Chin up.
Chin up.

27:56.709 --> 27:58.815
Oh, look at each other
just like that.

27:58.815 --> 28:00.886
Nice. Beautiful. Okay.

28:02.025 --> 28:03.716
Sorry.
Touch-ups.

28:03.716 --> 28:05.166
What?
What touch-ups?

28:05.166 --> 28:06.512
I'm sorry.
The cuticle on his thumb

28:06.512 --> 28:08.100
is driving me crazy.
He looks like a trucker.

28:08.100 --> 28:10.102
Eee. Well, fix it. Yeah.

28:10.102 --> 28:11.931
Yeah.
No truckers here.

28:11.931 --> 28:13.933
- Okay. Oh.
- Right here.

28:13.933 --> 28:16.280
- Oh, it's hot.
- I know, but it's so worth it.

28:16.280 --> 28:18.110
Yes, another one
just like that.

28:18.110 --> 28:19.283
Oh. Right, right.

28:19.283 --> 28:21.458
- There we go.
- Mm.

28:23.046 --> 28:24.910
What's wrong, Milos?

28:24.910 --> 28:26.256
It's the necklace.

28:26.256 --> 28:28.983
It distracts
from your stunning décolletage.

28:29.673 --> 28:30.709
Oh.

28:30.709 --> 28:32.469
You heard the man, Claude.

28:32.469 --> 28:35.783
Yes, of course.

28:35.783 --> 28:38.855
Ah.
Yes, yes. Gorgeous.

28:38.855 --> 28:40.063
I love it.

28:40.063 --> 28:41.996
Oh!

28:42.824 --> 28:44.274
Right there. Right.

28:44.274 --> 28:46.138
Right there.

28:46.138 --> 28:47.622
Hey, Milos.

28:47.622 --> 28:49.141
- Yeah.
- Step down two

28:49.141 --> 28:50.280
and test that for me.

28:50.280 --> 28:52.144
Well, o-o-okay.

28:54.629 --> 28:56.148
Oh, my God.

28:56.148 --> 28:57.494
- What?
- My bad.

28:57.494 --> 28:59.772
So sorry that he startled you,
dear, but--

28:59.772 --> 29:01.118
startled her.

29:01.118 --> 29:03.465
I'm gonna go find
a fuse box.

29:03.465 --> 29:04.777
Yeah.

29:05.778 --> 29:07.090
Oh.

29:18.515 --> 29:20.172
What the hell happened
with the lights?

29:22.174 --> 29:23.623
Something burning?

29:55.448 --> 29:57.036
Hey.

29:57.036 --> 29:58.727
How are you?

30:00.143 --> 30:01.213
Whoa, whoa.

30:04.319 --> 30:05.838
Ludwig, I thought I told you

30:05.838 --> 30:07.806
to keep Duchess
out of the study.

30:15.330 --> 30:17.332
Oh.

30:37.007 --> 30:38.146
I thought the assistant

30:38.146 --> 30:39.838
was supposed
to be fixing the fuse.

30:39.838 --> 30:41.391
So did I.

30:44.014 --> 30:45.498
You know, I--I think I'm lost.

30:45.498 --> 30:47.397
Hands.

30:51.470 --> 30:52.712
What are you doing in here?

30:52.712 --> 30:54.335
I--I was looking
for the sub-panel.

30:54.335 --> 30:56.026
How stupid do you think I am?

30:58.339 --> 30:59.443
Yeah, o-okay.

31:00.720 --> 31:02.274
What is this?
Wh--

31:02.274 --> 31:04.241
why are you touching
my assistant?

31:04.241 --> 31:06.071
Caught him
snooping around in here.

31:07.244 --> 31:09.246
Well, you guys do well
for yourselves.

31:10.144 --> 31:11.455
- He's clean.
- Anyway,

31:11.455 --> 31:13.768
for the next shot,
I'm thinking staircase.

31:13.768 --> 31:15.080
I'm thinking shadows.

31:15.080 --> 31:16.391
No, I'm sorry.

31:16.391 --> 31:17.806
There will be
no more next shot.

31:17.806 --> 31:18.946
We're done here.

31:22.294 --> 31:24.296
I'm so sorry, Milos.

31:24.296 --> 31:26.125
No, no, no.

31:26.125 --> 31:28.817
It is your husband
who should apologize.

31:28.817 --> 31:32.304
My next shot was going to be
my masterpiece.

31:34.789 --> 31:35.928
Don't worry about it, Charlie.

31:35.928 --> 31:37.930
We will figure something out.

31:37.930 --> 31:40.829
Or Daphne can wait
for her first installment.

31:40.829 --> 31:42.279
She's not gonna have to wait.

31:46.939 --> 31:49.804
Hi. Hi.

31:53.290 --> 31:55.603
You sneaky bastard.

31:57.467 --> 31:58.951
"A legacy you can count on."

31:58.951 --> 32:00.263
What does that even mean?

32:00.263 --> 32:01.954
You're more
than a name, David.

32:01.954 --> 32:04.267
You are part
of a political dynasty.

32:04.267 --> 32:07.063
Plus, it tested through
the roof at the focus group.

32:07.063 --> 32:08.616
Maybe that's the problem.

32:08.616 --> 32:10.342
What are you talking about?

32:10.342 --> 32:12.137
If David has
an authenticity problem,

32:12.137 --> 32:13.966
maybe it's because
you're trying to turn him

32:13.966 --> 32:16.141
into the candidate
who polls well

32:16.141 --> 32:18.143
instead of the candidate he is.

32:18.902 --> 32:20.869
You know what they say
about idealism?

32:21.698 --> 32:24.494
It's impotent without realism.

32:28.153 --> 32:30.120
Pretty sure
she just quoted Nixon.

32:30.120 --> 32:31.915
Seems right.

32:32.571 --> 32:35.988
Sorry about ambushing you
at work.

32:35.988 --> 32:37.127
Don't be.

32:37.127 --> 32:39.992
It's just...
work's been stressful.

32:39.992 --> 32:41.683
I hear that.

32:42.305 --> 32:43.754
I could use a drink.

32:44.514 --> 32:45.998
Oh, come on.

32:45.998 --> 32:47.966
We must have drank half their
wine collection as teenagers.

32:47.966 --> 32:49.622
How could they not
have noticed?

32:49.622 --> 32:51.866
Sometimes you see
what you want to see.

32:52.936 --> 32:56.284
Hey, thanks
for having my back earlier.

32:56.284 --> 32:58.977
And hey, if you decide
to come on board

32:58.977 --> 33:00.461
as my campaign strategist...

33:00.461 --> 33:01.634
David.

33:01.634 --> 33:02.704
It's not just
because you're brilliant

33:02.704 --> 33:04.292
at making sense
of stuff no one else can.

33:04.292 --> 33:05.638
- You don't understand.
- It's because you're

33:05.638 --> 33:07.157
the one person in this family

33:07.157 --> 33:09.263
who actually has my back.

33:20.929 --> 33:23.829
David, I don't really work
for a logistics firm.

33:25.417 --> 33:28.558
I work for the government,
same as you.

33:30.008 --> 33:33.839
Pattern Logistics
is just a front

33:33.839 --> 33:35.772
for a--

33:35.772 --> 33:39.155
a highly secretive
government agency.

33:40.397 --> 33:41.571
No way.

33:42.710 --> 33:44.574
It's why I'm so private,

33:44.574 --> 33:48.957
why I keep my compartments
so... compartmentalized.

33:52.409 --> 33:55.895
Thank you... for telling me.

33:57.966 --> 34:00.107
This is nice,
you letting me in.

34:02.454 --> 34:06.458
And for the record,
you were always like this.

34:08.115 --> 34:10.634
Maybe you just found a job
that suited you.

34:14.121 --> 34:15.984
Come on, sweetie.

34:15.984 --> 34:17.745
It was just part of the job.

34:17.745 --> 34:18.987
Oh, yeah?

34:18.987 --> 34:20.541
You're gonna really
stand there and tell me

34:20.541 --> 34:23.785
you didn't enjoy having her
fawning all over you?

34:23.785 --> 34:26.098
I didn't say that; I said
it was just part of the job.

34:26.098 --> 34:28.445
- Oh!
- Come on. Come on.

34:28.445 --> 34:31.276
Hey, it's not my fault.
I still got it.

34:31.276 --> 34:33.105
Hey, did she go down
without a fuss?

34:33.105 --> 34:34.658
Yeah, mostly.
Hey, Pop,

34:34.658 --> 34:36.004
you gotta stop teaching her

34:36.004 --> 34:37.144
the sleight of hand stuff, okay?

34:37.144 --> 34:39.318
Kid lifted my wallet--again.

34:39.318 --> 34:41.838
- Good job with Duchess.
- Yeah.

34:41.838 --> 34:43.598
Sniffed that one out
quick, huh?

34:43.598 --> 34:46.325
Hey, guys,
I think we have a problem.

34:46.325 --> 34:48.465
The diamond
in the necklace we just stole

34:48.465 --> 34:50.122
is already stolen.

34:50.122 --> 34:51.158
What?

34:51.158 --> 34:53.505
So it's called
the Black Orlov,

34:53.505 --> 34:55.990
and it was stolen
from a Hindu temple

34:55.990 --> 34:57.647
back in the 19th century.

34:57.647 --> 34:59.407
It's changed hands a bunch
of times throughout history.

34:59.407 --> 35:01.409
And now
it's ended up in ours.

35:01.409 --> 35:02.686
Yeah, but how are we
supposed to fence

35:02.686 --> 35:03.998
a stolen diamond?

35:03.998 --> 35:05.655
I don't know
what we're talking about.

35:05.655 --> 35:07.691
Daphne's expecting
mid-six figures.

35:07.691 --> 35:09.831
This necklace
is the only thing we've got.

35:09.831 --> 35:12.144
No, what we've got
is a stolen antiquity.

35:12.144 --> 35:13.766
It is legit priceless,

35:13.766 --> 35:15.872
but like Ma said,
we can't sell it.

35:19.358 --> 35:22.603
Okay... what if there's a way

35:22.603 --> 35:24.467
that we can have our cake
and eat it too?

35:24.467 --> 35:26.814
Yeah?
What are you thinking?

35:31.370 --> 35:33.510
You.

35:33.510 --> 35:35.305
You looking for a necklace?

35:41.208 --> 35:42.864
Where is the real one?

35:43.555 --> 35:44.797
It's safe.

35:44.797 --> 35:46.040
I can't believe this.

35:46.040 --> 35:47.283
What,
that I stole your necklace

35:47.283 --> 35:49.354
or that I'm here
to sell it back to you?

35:49.354 --> 35:51.528
Honestly, this is not
how I thought

35:51.528 --> 35:53.047
it was gonna go down.

35:53.047 --> 35:56.844
But once I realized
that it was actually stolen--

35:56.844 --> 35:58.708
It wasn't stolen.

35:58.708 --> 35:59.916
It was a gift.

36:00.710 --> 36:02.988
A gift. Hmm.

36:02.988 --> 36:05.404
You know, last I checked,
gifts aren't normally laundered.

36:05.404 --> 36:07.544
But, you know, gift, bribe,
"to-may-to," "to-mah-to,"

36:07.544 --> 36:08.890
whatever you want to call it.

36:08.890 --> 36:12.653
What your Russian oligarch pal
failed to mention

36:12.653 --> 36:15.587
was that that necklace
is actually

36:15.587 --> 36:18.003
a plundered cultural artifact,
one the Indian government

36:18.003 --> 36:21.524
has been looking for
for quite a while now.

36:22.041 --> 36:23.319
What are you talking about?

36:23.319 --> 36:25.493
Oh, come on.
You know the story.

36:25.493 --> 36:28.945
Colonialism, greed, corruption.

36:30.533 --> 36:32.949
I mean, it's funny, isn't it,

36:32.949 --> 36:37.609
how--how everything changes,
then yet... nothing changes?

36:37.609 --> 36:39.611
Everything is stolen.

36:39.611 --> 36:41.751
All that matters
is who has it last.

36:41.751 --> 36:44.961
Wow, you should use that
in the article.

36:44.961 --> 36:46.721
What article?

36:48.758 --> 36:50.656
<i>The Washington Post.</i>

36:52.451 --> 36:53.970
They were very moved
by your offer

36:53.970 --> 36:56.283
to return the diamond
to the rightful owner.

36:56.283 --> 36:58.733
Oh, uh,
I should probably mention.

36:58.733 --> 37:00.632
Got ahold
of the Indian ambassador.

37:00.632 --> 37:03.807
Yeah, she should be here
any moment as well.

37:08.985 --> 37:10.573
How much do you want?

37:15.060 --> 37:17.096
<i>Money's just money, right?</i>

37:17.959 --> 37:20.928
<i>No, the only thing truly
priceless to a person like you</i>

37:20.928 --> 37:23.275
<i>is your sparkling reputation.</i>

37:25.312 --> 37:27.797
<i>So you can either be a hero</i>

37:27.797 --> 37:31.076
<i>who returns a plundered
cultural artifact...</i>

37:33.181 --> 37:36.944
Or you can let the world see
exactly who you are.

37:55.514 --> 37:57.861
- Hey.
<i>- Hey.</i>

37:57.861 --> 38:00.485
I'm sorry about what I said

38:00.485 --> 38:03.039
about this... being a rebound.

38:03.971 --> 38:05.317
I didn't mean it.

38:05.317 --> 38:07.215
Well, it had to come
from somewhere.

38:09.321 --> 38:10.840
I'm not good at this...

38:12.151 --> 38:15.983
At letting people in, letting...

38:15.983 --> 38:18.330
People see the real me.

38:18.330 --> 38:20.332
Hey, look,
I get it, all right?

38:20.332 --> 38:21.989
More than you know.

38:21.989 --> 38:24.543
<i>With you,
there is no hiding.</i>

38:24.543 --> 38:26.614
It's not just that
you see me, Charlie.

38:26.614 --> 38:28.892
Sometimes it feels like...

38:28.892 --> 38:31.136
you can see through me,
and that's...

38:32.793 --> 38:36.072
Scary.

38:37.970 --> 38:39.351
Why?

38:39.351 --> 38:41.491
Because you might be
the only person in the world

38:41.491 --> 38:42.837
who does.

38:48.084 --> 38:49.741
Well, good morning.

38:49.741 --> 38:50.983
If you're going to ask me

38:50.983 --> 38:53.054
about the relationship status
form--

38:53.054 --> 38:54.608
You were right about Daphne.

38:58.474 --> 39:00.234
<i>Move up the plan.</i>

39:00.234 --> 39:01.718
<i>Have your men ready
for delivery,</i>

39:01.718 --> 39:03.858
<i>9:00 tomorrow night
at the port.</i>

39:04.687 --> 39:06.516
So do you want to reach out
to the FBI, or should I?

39:18.045 --> 39:19.702
<i>♪ Well, I've got a feeling</i>

39:19.702 --> 39:21.289
You have something for me?

39:21.289 --> 39:24.603
Uh, as a matter
of fact, we do.

39:24.603 --> 39:25.949
<i>♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

39:25.949 --> 39:27.503
We now serve mojitos.

39:31.023 --> 39:33.440
And I think the words you're
looking for are "thank you."

39:34.786 --> 39:37.789
<i>♪ All through the night</i>

39:37.789 --> 39:39.584
You don't even
want to count it?

39:40.239 --> 39:41.793
Judging by the weight,

39:41.793 --> 39:45.279
I'd say you have
roughly 14.5 million to go.

39:45.279 --> 39:47.143
But here's to a good start.

39:47.143 --> 39:49.145
Oh, that's--
I like that.

39:49.145 --> 39:52.631
That's--yeah.

39:52.631 --> 39:55.600
So we will do your bidding.

39:55.600 --> 39:56.808
But I would be grateful

39:56.808 --> 39:58.637
if you would leave
my daughter out of it.

39:59.500 --> 40:02.330
Whatever ASL night school
classes you've signed up for,

40:02.330 --> 40:04.436
maybe it's time to drop them.

40:10.960 --> 40:13.307
You know,
my mother used to say

40:13.307 --> 40:15.447
the only thing more dangerous

40:15.447 --> 40:18.312
than a man
with nothing to lose

40:18.312 --> 40:20.590
is a single mom
with everything to prove.

40:33.154 --> 40:35.363
You want to give the order,
or should I?

40:35.363 --> 40:37.193
You know the drill, Vic.

40:37.193 --> 40:39.229
Right.
You were never here.

40:40.368 --> 40:41.473
Cut it.

40:51.000 --> 40:52.588
- We're clear.
- Clear.

40:58.317 --> 40:59.595
Where's the shipment?

41:02.529 --> 41:03.771
Is that--

41:03.771 --> 41:05.359
The bug we planted.

41:06.153 --> 41:08.500
Damn.
She played us.

41:08.500 --> 41:10.882
No.
She made us.

41:17.820 --> 41:19.373
Thanks, Pop.

41:19.373 --> 41:20.995
Ah, Cliffs of Moher.

41:20.995 --> 41:22.894
Haven't seen those
since our honeymoon.

41:24.067 --> 41:25.655
Wait.
Hold on a second.

41:25.655 --> 41:27.554
You and Mom were in Ireland
on your honeymoon.

41:27.554 --> 41:29.176
You're telling me
that Cliffs of Moher--

41:29.176 --> 41:30.418
this is Ireland?

41:30.418 --> 41:31.730
Last I checked.

41:36.459 --> 41:37.874
She's his daughter.

41:37.874 --> 41:41.257
Daphne is
Patrick Maguire's daughter.

41:41.257 --> 41:43.846
So, Pop, that's why
he trusts her, right?

41:43.846 --> 41:45.088
And that's why someone like her

41:45.088 --> 41:46.573
rises up through the ranks
so quickly.

41:46.573 --> 41:48.195
I wonder why they're
keeping it a secret.

41:48.195 --> 41:49.748
I don't know,
but I think we just found

41:49.748 --> 41:51.094
our vulnerability.

41:51.094 --> 41:53.165
- <i>Sláinte.</i>
- Mm-hmm.

42:00.241 --> 42:02.105
<i>I know who our enemy is.</i>

42:02.105 --> 42:03.762
<i>Emma Hill.</i>

42:03.762 --> 42:05.453
I don't know which agency
she works for,

42:05.453 --> 42:07.732
but considering
they planted an illegal bug,

42:07.732 --> 42:09.906
my guess is, it's not the FBI.

42:09.906 --> 42:13.600
<i>In 72 hours, I brought in
$1/2 million in cash</i>

42:13.600 --> 42:15.049
without selling
an ounce of fentanyl,

42:15.049 --> 42:16.775
and I've managed
to identify the woman

42:16.775 --> 42:18.294
who wants to take us down.

42:19.951 --> 42:21.608
Now do you believe
I have what it takes

42:21.608 --> 42:23.575
to run this organization?
