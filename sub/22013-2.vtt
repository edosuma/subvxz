WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:03.337
You're witnessing
the power of Empire.

00:03.371 --> 00:05.739
I'm Cookie Lyon, baby.
I'm unforgettable.

00:05.773 --> 00:07.541
Catch all-new episodes
Wednesdays.

00:07.575 --> 00:09.177
And check out
our other Fox programs--

00:09.210 --> 00:11.812
Star, The Gifted,
and Lethal Weapon.

00:11.845 --> 00:14.448
That was the best idea
you've had all day.

00:14.482 --> 00:15.616
Only on Fox.

00:16.817 --> 00:19.087
Previously on Empire...

00:19.120 --> 00:20.654
Lucious!

00:20.688 --> 00:23.391
Did somebody do this to me?
I can't remember.

00:23.424 --> 00:24.792
As y'all can see, I got lucky.

00:24.825 --> 00:26.760
But I will never be the same.

00:26.794 --> 00:28.696
We took Lucious out
'cause you said

00:28.729 --> 00:30.731
we'd be running things.
It's gonna happen.

00:30.764 --> 00:31.665
(gagging)

00:33.267 --> 00:35.136
Anika Lyon?
You're under arrest

00:35.169 --> 00:36.837
for the murder
of Tariq Cousins.

00:36.870 --> 00:39.173
It doesn't take
a rocket scientist

00:39.207 --> 00:40.708
to figure out
you're up to something.

00:40.741 --> 00:42.376
CLAUDIA:
He's redirecting his feelings

00:42.410 --> 00:44.745
and his desires onto me.

00:44.778 --> 00:45.746
Lucious.

00:45.779 --> 00:47.215
You're gonna
remember me.

00:47.248 --> 00:48.282
I'm Cookie Lyon, baby.

00:48.316 --> 00:50.218
I'm unforgettable.

01:04.632 --> 01:06.600
CLAUDIA:
Dwight?

01:06.634 --> 01:09.270
We're all set.

01:12.140 --> 01:14.142
Are you ready?

01:20.214 --> 01:21.449
Okay, um...

01:22.383 --> 01:24.685
Maybe I should...

01:24.718 --> 01:28.556
try doing it by myself,
for once.

01:28.589 --> 01:29.857
That's good.

01:29.890 --> 01:31.559
That's really good.

01:31.592 --> 01:32.893
I mean, it's an important

01:32.926 --> 01:36.330
first step.

01:36.364 --> 01:40.701
Well, if you need me,
I'll be close by.

01:49.777 --> 01:51.345
(grunts)

02:03.224 --> 02:04.658
(exhales)

02:11.299 --> 02:12.700
(straining)

02:14.402 --> 02:16.637
LEAH:
* Mona Lisa

02:16.670 --> 02:20.441
(echoing):
* Mona Lisa

02:20.474 --> 02:24.445
* Mona Lisa,
men have named you *

02:24.478 --> 02:26.880
* You're so like the lady
with the mystic... *

02:26.914 --> 02:29.817
No, no, no, no,
what are you doing?

02:29.850 --> 02:31.819
This is your son!
God told me
Dwight needed my help!

02:31.852 --> 02:32.920
(coughing)
CLAUDIA: No...

02:32.953 --> 02:34.855
I know what I know, sister.

02:34.888 --> 02:36.357
Evilness is in him.
Enough.

02:36.390 --> 02:38.392
Evilness is in him!

02:38.426 --> 02:40.428
(panting)

02:42.463 --> 02:44.465
*

02:49.470 --> 02:52.206
(door opens)

02:52.240 --> 02:54.208
Hello?

02:54.242 --> 02:55.609
Excuse me.

02:55.643 --> 02:57.911
Excu-- what's going...
Can-can I help you?

02:57.945 --> 03:00.314
COOKIE: That's right, fellas,
take it all to the west wing.

03:00.348 --> 03:01.749
Cookie, what's going on?

03:01.782 --> 03:03.851
It's 11:00 at night.
Oh, I know what time it is,

03:03.884 --> 03:05.719
sweetie, I'm moving in
like I should've did

03:05.753 --> 03:07.521
when he came home
from the hospital.

03:07.555 --> 03:09.257
See, this is my house.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

03:09.290 --> 03:11.325
You bust it, you buy it,
and I know you can't afford it.

03:11.359 --> 03:12.560
MAN:
Sorry about that, ma'am.

03:12.593 --> 03:14.462
That's fine.
Look, I-I know that

03:14.495 --> 03:16.564
you may not
fully trust me,

03:16.597 --> 03:18.532
but I want to assure you...
No, no, no, no, no.

03:18.566 --> 03:20.734
Let me assure you.

03:20.768 --> 03:23.404
I understand that you got
a job to do, okay?

03:23.437 --> 03:24.805
I hired you to do it.

03:24.838 --> 03:28.442
That man is everything
to me and my boys.

03:28.476 --> 03:30.478
And we need him back--
I need him.

03:31.779 --> 03:33.314
So I'm moving in
to supervise.

03:33.347 --> 03:34.782
Don't worry about it. Come on!

03:34.815 --> 03:36.284
Right on around,
you know where to go.

03:36.317 --> 03:37.951
Be careful,
those are very expensive.

03:37.985 --> 03:38.986
Shh, shh, shh.

03:39.019 --> 03:40.321
No, you shush.

03:40.354 --> 03:41.855
You hurry up and fix my man,

03:41.889 --> 03:43.824
or we gonna have a problem.

03:43.857 --> 03:45.726
That's right, fellas,
keep going.

03:45.759 --> 03:49.697
Keep going-- you drop my bag
again, baby, that's your ass.

03:49.730 --> 03:51.765
* Know I'm okay

03:51.799 --> 03:54.968
* I just wan-na...

03:55.002 --> 03:56.604
Y'all, this song is too good

03:56.637 --> 03:58.339
to just be playing
at the end of the damn credits.

03:58.372 --> 04:00.341
Everybody's gonna be walking out
of the theater.

04:00.374 --> 04:02.276
The hell they will; they
gonna sit they asses down

04:02.310 --> 04:04.578
and listen till
the song is over.
Hmm.

04:04.612 --> 04:06.013
Yeah, Jamal, forget the ASAs.
You could win an Oscar

04:06.046 --> 04:07.348
for Best Original Song.

04:07.381 --> 04:09.317
WARREN:
That's right.

04:09.350 --> 04:10.451
Move over, Celine Dion.

04:10.484 --> 04:12.686
(laughter)

04:12.720 --> 04:14.388
Okay. I am so glad

04:14.422 --> 04:17.591
that you finally buried
the hatchet with Tory.

04:17.625 --> 04:20.461
I mean, did I really
have a choice?

04:20.494 --> 04:22.029
Calling me every
second, talking about

04:22.062 --> 04:23.364
(high-pitched):
"Come on, forgive Tory.

04:23.397 --> 04:24.832
Forgive her, Jamal."

04:24.865 --> 04:26.033
Okay, that kind of
sounds like me.
(chuckles)

04:26.066 --> 04:27.401
But I'm about to start using

04:27.435 --> 04:30.904
my powers of persuasion
for a job,

04:30.938 --> 04:33.040
since I'm only A&R
on an interim basis

04:33.073 --> 04:36.577
while Cookie looks
for someone to replace me.

04:36.610 --> 04:37.745
I don't know why you even
stressing over that.

04:37.778 --> 04:38.846
You know my mom.

04:38.879 --> 04:41.482
You gonna get this A&R position,

04:41.515 --> 04:44.084
you're gonna help me with my
new album-- it's all love songs.

04:44.117 --> 04:46.053
Love?

04:46.086 --> 04:48.356
I wonder what inspired
that decision.

04:50.090 --> 04:51.925
You did.

04:51.959 --> 04:53.093
(laughs)

04:53.126 --> 04:54.962
(both laugh)

04:54.995 --> 04:56.397
ANDRE: Empire XStream
is already on track

04:56.430 --> 04:57.898
to surpass the competition.

04:57.931 --> 04:59.833
And we have a list of
telecommunication companies

04:59.867 --> 05:02.035
ready to partner
with our artists' releases.

05:02.069 --> 05:04.104
MAN: If you're looking to sell
off parts of Empire XStream,

05:04.137 --> 05:05.973
Commonpoint Capital wants in.

05:06.006 --> 05:08.008
You can expect
a formal offer tomorrow.

05:08.041 --> 05:09.410
Thank you, sir.
Thank you very much.
All right.

05:09.443 --> 05:11.379
All right, thank you.
Absolutely.

05:11.412 --> 05:14.047
* But I'm in love with it

05:14.081 --> 05:15.749
* I'm in love with you...

05:20.120 --> 05:21.455
How you doing, Sam?

05:22.656 --> 05:24.692
I'll have the usual.
Sure.

05:26.560 --> 05:28.562
*

05:37.638 --> 05:39.740
Are you alone?

05:41.775 --> 05:43.444
Not anymore.

05:43.477 --> 05:44.545
(laughs softly)

05:44.578 --> 05:47.014
What are you drinking?

05:49.016 --> 05:51.018
Whatever you're buying.

05:58.025 --> 05:59.993
* Ooh

06:00.027 --> 06:03.063
* Give me a reason

06:03.096 --> 06:06.967
* 'Cause I ain't going home

06:07.000 --> 06:10.471
(laughs)
* You don't want to start

06:10.504 --> 06:13.641
* I ain't swinging low

06:13.674 --> 06:16.777
* I'm just leaning.

06:16.810 --> 06:19.680
(panting)

06:19.713 --> 06:21.849
Looks like it's
not our night.

06:26.219 --> 06:29.923
My doctor has me on
new medication.

06:32.192 --> 06:34.695
Well, tell him he just cost you

06:34.728 --> 06:36.964
the best piece of ass
you would've ever had.

06:49.009 --> 06:50.177
(claps hands)

06:54.848 --> 06:58.919
Okay. Tell me the first thing
that comes to your mind.

06:58.952 --> 07:01.221
Philly.

07:01.254 --> 07:04.224
Excellent.

07:04.257 --> 07:05.793
How about this one?

07:05.826 --> 07:08.496
Liberty Bell is near
Rittenhouse Square.

07:08.529 --> 07:10.864
CLAUDIA:
Excellent.

07:10.898 --> 07:11.832
COOKIE: Hey, Lucious.
Hey.

07:11.865 --> 07:13.133
COOKIE:
How about we get

07:13.166 --> 07:14.735
some breakfast, huh?

07:14.768 --> 07:16.203
I want to get
your thoughts on, um,

07:16.236 --> 07:19.206
us selling Empire XStream.
Andre got a great offer.

07:19.239 --> 07:22.810
I don't have any thoughts
on anything like that.

07:22.843 --> 07:25.078
Cookie, Dwight and I are right
in the middle of a session.

07:25.112 --> 07:27.114
I can see that.

07:27.147 --> 07:28.582
Uh...

07:30.017 --> 07:32.553
Look. You got to
remember this one.

07:32.586 --> 07:34.121
This is us, in Philly,
where we started.

07:34.154 --> 07:36.824
Is that a gun right there?

07:36.857 --> 07:38.125
Cookie, can you excuse us?

07:38.158 --> 07:39.192
Well, ask your doctor.

07:39.226 --> 07:40.694
She got all the damn answers.

07:43.163 --> 07:44.197
(sighs)

07:44.231 --> 07:45.666
(door opens)

07:45.699 --> 07:47.000
All rise.

07:50.571 --> 07:51.705
Be seated.

07:51.739 --> 07:54.107
MYRA:
Good morning, Your Honor.

07:54.141 --> 07:55.509
In light of the fact
that my client

07:55.543 --> 07:56.877
has already spent

07:56.910 --> 07:58.646
five months in jail...

07:58.679 --> 08:00.814
Counselor, is there anything
you're about to say

08:00.848 --> 08:02.282
that'll make me forget

08:02.315 --> 08:04.284
that Ms. Calhoun is
accused of murdering

08:04.317 --> 08:05.953
a federal agent?

08:07.254 --> 08:08.856
Former agent, Your Honor.

08:08.889 --> 08:10.924
Ms. Calhoun is not
a flight risk.

08:10.958 --> 08:13.627
She wants
to clear her name.

08:13.661 --> 08:15.596
I'll take that as a no.

08:15.629 --> 08:17.030
The trial's in six months.

08:17.064 --> 08:19.600
Ms. Calhoun will remain
in custody until then.

08:19.633 --> 08:22.002
No, Your Honor, please!
I am innocent!

08:22.035 --> 08:24.705
With all due respect,
Your Honor,

08:24.738 --> 08:26.006
I don't think
my client's circumstances

08:26.039 --> 08:27.641
are being
considered at all.

08:27.675 --> 08:30.110
We would appreciate
a chance to be heard.

08:30.143 --> 08:31.745
Hakeem, go get Cookie.

08:31.779 --> 08:33.681
Tell her to see me now.
What is she gonna do?

08:33.714 --> 08:36.249
Tell her I remember
January 7, 2015.

08:36.283 --> 08:38.118
Tell her I remember.

08:40.320 --> 08:43.791
JAMAL:
* I will ride for you

08:46.159 --> 08:49.262
* Without a destination

08:52.032 --> 08:55.235
* I'd die a thousand times
for you, yeah... *

08:55.268 --> 08:56.770
(music volume lowers)

08:56.804 --> 08:58.972
Guys, I love it. It's amazing.

08:59.006 --> 09:00.841
I'm on the red-eye to
Paris tonight, and I'm
taking it with me.

09:00.874 --> 09:02.743
Oh, we can get it
to you immediately

09:02.776 --> 09:03.677
if you need...
Yeah, no doubt.

09:03.711 --> 09:04.978
Well, hang on, hang on,
hang on, hang on.

09:05.012 --> 09:06.647
I got a few tiny changes.

09:06.680 --> 09:10.618
This is gonna be the main title
theme song to the movie.

09:10.651 --> 09:13.353
Uh, it's a hero's journey.
It needs to be epic.

09:13.386 --> 09:15.322
Add a string section.

09:15.355 --> 09:17.891
A whole
orchestral thing.

09:17.925 --> 09:19.693
Uh, lose the falsetto
altogether,

09:19.727 --> 09:21.862
uh, and the piano in the middle;
add more strings there, too.

09:21.895 --> 09:23.631
Whoa, wait, wait, wait, uh...
(chuckles)

09:23.664 --> 09:25.232
Um, the orchestral thing

09:25.265 --> 09:27.067
sounds-sounds pretty cool,
but if you...

09:27.100 --> 09:30.638
if you take out
the falsetto and the piano,

09:30.671 --> 09:32.372
y-you change the whole
arrangement, you really
change the whole song.

09:32.405 --> 09:35.843
Which we can do before
your flight tonight.

09:35.876 --> 09:37.645
Perfect.

09:37.678 --> 09:38.912
Can't wait.

09:38.946 --> 09:40.347
Thanks.

09:40.380 --> 09:42.916
BECKY:
Oh, my God.

09:42.950 --> 09:43.917
(door opens)

09:43.951 --> 09:46.186
Yo, man.
What's up, man?

09:46.219 --> 09:48.789
H-Have my back, Becky.

09:48.822 --> 09:50.090
Have your b...

09:50.123 --> 09:52.225
(laughs)
Boy, you know I got your back.

09:52.259 --> 09:54.628
But we have a client,
and we have to do

09:54.662 --> 09:56.063
what he wants, right?

09:56.096 --> 09:57.865
We in this together.

09:57.898 --> 09:59.800
Can you make this
deadline tonight?

09:59.833 --> 10:02.903
All right, let's
go get this Oscar.

10:02.936 --> 10:04.071
Get it!

10:04.104 --> 10:05.238
COOKIE:
All right, where is she?

10:05.272 --> 10:06.874
I have a company to run.

10:06.907 --> 10:08.208
(door buzzes, opens)

10:08.241 --> 10:09.777
(Thirsty clears throat)

10:09.810 --> 10:11.812
(Cookie scoffs)
Rough.

10:11.845 --> 10:14.147
Yeah, well,
jail ain't for the weak.
Legit.

10:14.181 --> 10:16.116
(Cookie and Thirsty chuckle)

10:16.149 --> 10:19.019
(clears throat)
(door closes)

10:19.052 --> 10:21.288
I see y'all got my message.

10:21.321 --> 10:23.356
Yeah, I managed to crack
your code, James Bond.

10:23.390 --> 10:25.058
January 7, 2015.

10:25.092 --> 10:26.727
That's when Bunkie died.

10:26.760 --> 10:28.061
I think you mean killed.

10:28.095 --> 10:29.663
THIRSTY: Okay.
(clears throat) Okay.
(sighs)

10:29.697 --> 10:31.665
Okay. Look, you got
our attention, we're here.

10:31.699 --> 10:32.866
What do you want?

10:32.900 --> 10:35.068
To get the hell up out of here.

10:35.102 --> 10:37.037
Okay, slow your roll, bitch.

10:37.070 --> 10:39.039
For all we know,
you did kill Tariq.

10:39.072 --> 10:40.974
You been a snake
since day one.

10:41.008 --> 10:42.375
You want this snake to bite?

10:42.409 --> 10:45.012
We paid you $25 million
to bounce

10:45.045 --> 10:47.014
and keep your mouth shut.

10:47.047 --> 10:48.215
But here you are,

10:48.248 --> 10:50.217
still around,

10:50.250 --> 10:52.052
still running your mouth,
still in the way.
Okay, okay.

10:52.085 --> 10:54.154
Let's loosen, let's loosen
the bra straps, all right?

10:54.187 --> 10:55.889
Let's just get
to a resolution.

10:55.923 --> 10:57.357
I can get you in front
of the U.S. Attorney

10:57.390 --> 10:58.458
as early as this afternoon.

10:58.491 --> 11:00.127
But to get you out of here...

11:00.160 --> 11:02.395
(door buzzes)
you're gonna have to play nice.

11:02.429 --> 11:04.798
Shut up and do
exactly what I say.

11:04.832 --> 11:06.700
You okay with that?

11:13.974 --> 11:17.778
Nah, it doesn't look
familiar at all.

11:17.811 --> 11:19.146
Let's just give it some time.

11:19.179 --> 11:21.749
This is one of your...

11:21.782 --> 11:23.483
favorite places.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.853
Look, this is the exact booth
we're sitting in right now.

11:25.886 --> 11:27.821
Just see if there's some

11:27.855 --> 11:30.123
tastes or smells that
might trigger some memories.

11:30.157 --> 11:32.359
CLEM: How y'all doing?
We got a brick chicken special

11:32.392 --> 11:35.028
so good, you'll smack
your own mama. (chuckles)

11:36.229 --> 11:39.499
Lucious? Lyon?

11:39.532 --> 11:42.235
What's up, L?
(laughs)

11:43.370 --> 11:44.738
Look at you,

11:44.772 --> 11:47.274
coming into my joint
all incog-negro.

11:47.307 --> 11:48.809
Boy, you know
this is your home.

11:48.842 --> 11:50.778
You gonna feed this woman?

11:50.811 --> 11:51.879
How you doing, lady?

11:51.912 --> 11:53.113
I'm Clem.

11:53.146 --> 11:54.848
Well, Clem, nice to meet you.
I'm Claudia.

11:54.882 --> 11:56.817
Yeah, you must be
some kind of special

11:56.850 --> 11:58.185
to be up in here with L.

11:58.218 --> 11:59.753
He only ever comes here
with Eddie.

11:59.787 --> 12:00.954
Eddie?

12:00.988 --> 12:03.256
Um, I don't know Eddie.

12:03.290 --> 12:05.125
Eddie Barker. Come on,
you trying to tell me

12:05.158 --> 12:06.493
you don't know
the great composer,

12:06.526 --> 12:08.528
arranger and super producer?
(chuckles)

12:08.561 --> 12:09.930
You know,

12:09.963 --> 12:11.231
there was this one time,

12:11.264 --> 12:13.100
right after Lucious
had won a Grammy,

12:13.133 --> 12:14.534
he and Eddie came up in here.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.837
Both of 'em had, on both arms,

12:16.870 --> 12:19.506
two of the finest,
big-boned sisters...

12:19.539 --> 12:21.141
You know what, Clem,
I think that we should

12:21.174 --> 12:23.310
move onto the menu,
and we'll hold off

12:23.343 --> 12:25.512
on the old stories
for now.

12:25.545 --> 12:27.547
Yeah, okay.

12:27.580 --> 12:30.117
I'll get some waters
over right away.

12:30.150 --> 12:32.152
Uh...

12:32.185 --> 12:34.387
It's good to see you
up and on your feet, Lucious.

12:34.421 --> 12:36.256
We're all pulling for you.

12:36.289 --> 12:38.826
Thank you, Clem.

12:38.859 --> 12:39.993
Thank you.

12:45.065 --> 12:47.200
I think you hurt his feelings.

12:47.234 --> 12:49.502
I just need to
guide the conversation

12:49.536 --> 12:50.938
on these initial outings.

12:50.971 --> 12:54.274
Is that what
life is like, though?

12:54.307 --> 12:57.044
I mean, is it all
planned and scheduled?

12:57.077 --> 12:58.545
No, of course not.

12:58.578 --> 13:01.481
So, I'm just managing
the pace.

13:03.516 --> 13:06.519
*

13:14.928 --> 13:16.997
Tell me that
ain't a banger.

13:17.030 --> 13:18.131
(music volume lowers)

13:18.165 --> 13:19.867
It's too soft.
Too soft?

13:19.900 --> 13:21.969
I remember you saying that
about "Drip Drop,"

13:22.002 --> 13:23.403
and that became
your biggest hit.

13:23.436 --> 13:25.338
My biggest pop hit.

13:25.372 --> 13:27.474
The streets still go crazy for
"Drip Drop," and you know that.

13:27.507 --> 13:29.977
I could do another "Drip Drop"
in my sleep.

13:30.010 --> 13:31.845
But I need to go harder.

13:31.879 --> 13:33.413
It ain't about hip-hop
versus pop.

13:33.446 --> 13:35.215
This is about you thinking
that you can't top yourself.

13:35.248 --> 13:36.316
Mmm.

13:36.349 --> 13:37.484
(song stops)

13:39.252 --> 13:41.021
You know,
when Anika was head of A&R,

13:41.054 --> 13:43.456
she never tried to analyze me.

13:43.490 --> 13:45.258
She just supported my vision.

13:45.292 --> 13:47.094
Keem, I'm not trying
to kill your vibe.

13:47.127 --> 13:48.929
Okay?

13:48.962 --> 13:50.430
I'm trying to
let you know that

13:50.463 --> 13:52.966
if you make a pop record
and it blows up,

13:53.000 --> 13:54.467
that's how you're gonna
get the leverage

13:54.501 --> 13:56.469
to do whatever
you want around here.

13:56.503 --> 13:58.238
That's how this works.

13:58.271 --> 14:00.373
You want me to top "Drip Drop"?

14:00.407 --> 14:01.942
I know your potential.

14:01.975 --> 14:04.011
All right,
whatever you want, Becky.

14:04.044 --> 14:06.046
All right, then.

14:06.079 --> 14:08.415
Let's show 'em we still got
Lyons roaring up in here.

14:08.448 --> 14:10.083
Let's get it.
You're gonna make something

14:10.117 --> 14:11.218
better than
"Drip Drop," right?

14:11.251 --> 14:12.652
Give me something
to dance to.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.321
* Drip, drop, drip.
Right?
(laughs)

14:14.354 --> 14:16.289
Let's do it.
I trust you.

14:19.026 --> 14:21.561
Hey, where you want
to start, boss?

14:21.594 --> 14:23.463
No, not yet.

14:23.496 --> 14:25.999
Not till I get this beat
out my head.

14:26.033 --> 14:29.469
One for me,
before I make one for them.

14:29.502 --> 14:33.173
*

14:36.343 --> 14:39.446
Well, I think I need to go
and find me a restroom.

14:39.479 --> 14:41.949
You know where it is?
Just right... in the back.

14:41.982 --> 14:43.683
Okay?

14:43.716 --> 14:46.653
(drum machine playing)

14:53.260 --> 14:54.962
CLEM: Come on, Willy, man,
you got to pick up,

14:54.995 --> 14:56.129
pick up the pace, man.

14:56.163 --> 14:57.330
Yeah, yeah, sorry, boss.
Hey.

14:57.364 --> 14:59.432
Hey, Clem.
Oh, what you need, L?

14:59.466 --> 15:02.235
Do you have a way of getting
in touch with Eddie?

15:02.269 --> 15:04.537
He probably won't answer
his phone today.

15:04.571 --> 15:06.940
His niece is getting married
over at his country club.

15:06.974 --> 15:08.341
You been there, right?

15:08.375 --> 15:10.077
The Vandeveer?

15:10.110 --> 15:11.378
Vandeveer.
Yeah.

15:11.411 --> 15:12.645
Thanks, Clem.

15:12.679 --> 15:15.015
CLEM:
No problem.

15:15.048 --> 15:18.351
*

15:21.188 --> 15:22.389
Get the mic. Let's get it.

15:26.293 --> 15:28.628
HAKEEM:
* Hey, hey, I don't want to talk
about your whereabouts *

15:28.661 --> 15:30.430
* I don't want to

15:30.463 --> 15:32.465
* Hear the rumors
that you hear about *

15:32.499 --> 15:34.001
* No. So much paper,
I take walks *

15:34.034 --> 15:35.468
* Around my bank account

15:35.502 --> 15:37.204
* It's the only thing
that I think about *

15:37.237 --> 15:38.605
* That paper route

15:38.638 --> 15:42.042
* Uh, everybody
want to be a don now *

15:42.075 --> 15:45.278
* But I'm the only one
that really get it done now *

15:45.312 --> 15:47.981
* Tell my daddy take a good look
at his son now *

15:48.015 --> 15:50.083
* If you praying
on my downfall *
Dwight?

15:50.117 --> 15:51.218
* You should shut up, trick...

15:51.251 --> 15:53.186
Excuse me, can I get
a key to the bathroom?

15:53.220 --> 15:54.654
I think there's something
wrong with Dwight.

15:54.687 --> 15:57.190
Dwight?
Lucious. H-He won't answer.

15:57.224 --> 15:59.559
He ain't in there. He left.

15:59.592 --> 16:01.728
What do you mean he left?
He can't leave.

16:01.761 --> 16:03.496
He's a grown man, lady.

16:03.530 --> 16:05.465
*

16:05.498 --> 16:06.566
* Shut up, trick...

16:06.599 --> 16:08.535
Vandeveer.

16:08.568 --> 16:10.070
* Shut up, shut up

16:10.103 --> 16:12.672
* Hoo! Shut up, trick.

16:16.743 --> 16:20.080
DRIVER: I can't believe
I got you in my cab.

16:20.113 --> 16:22.615
I am the biggest Lucious Lyon
fan there's ever been.

16:22.649 --> 16:25.185
You don't even know, man.
You don't even know.

16:25.218 --> 16:26.586
You might be right about that.

16:26.619 --> 16:28.255
You and your music

16:28.288 --> 16:30.557
got me so much trim
over the years.

16:30.590 --> 16:32.225
I had a whole system.

16:32.259 --> 16:35.328
Called it the "Lucious Lyon
Triple Takedown."

16:35.362 --> 16:37.230
You take a lady
to the club,

16:37.264 --> 16:39.132
get her out on the dance floor,

16:39.166 --> 16:41.268
sweating to your joint,
"On the Grind."

16:41.301 --> 16:43.436
On the way home,

16:43.470 --> 16:45.105
get her loose with that
"Make You Mine."

16:45.138 --> 16:46.606
And then, get her
freaky in the bedroom

16:46.639 --> 16:48.708
with that "Hot Little Thing."

16:48.741 --> 16:50.110
Whoo!

16:50.143 --> 16:52.011
(chuckles)
"Hot Little Thing."

16:54.614 --> 16:56.483
(guests laughing)
MAN: And now, um,

16:56.516 --> 16:58.451
let's hear from our host, huh?

16:58.485 --> 17:02.189
And my little brother,
Eddie Barker.

17:02.222 --> 17:04.557
(applause)

17:10.430 --> 17:12.765
David, Claire,

17:12.799 --> 17:14.734
there's plenty of
people in this room

17:14.767 --> 17:16.803
who'd like to
offer you some

17:16.836 --> 17:19.406
sage advice about how to
have a successful marriage.

17:19.439 --> 17:22.375
(guests murmuring)

17:22.409 --> 17:25.712
But my advice to you is...

17:25.745 --> 17:27.347
don't listen to any of them.
(guests laugh)

17:27.380 --> 17:28.481
Don't even listen to me.

17:28.515 --> 17:30.383
'Cause everyone

17:30.417 --> 17:34.087
has, uh, some idea about
how you should live your life

17:34.121 --> 17:37.857
and what you should be.

17:37.890 --> 17:41.461
But this is your time,

17:41.494 --> 17:43.230
this is your path.

17:43.263 --> 17:47.134
And if, on your journey, you
experience struggle or pain,

17:47.167 --> 17:50.270
welcome it, 'cause
struggles turn love...

17:51.771 --> 17:54.141
...into lasting love.

17:54.174 --> 17:56.609
So let's do a toast to...

17:56.643 --> 17:59.346
(sighs)
to lasting love.

17:59.379 --> 18:01.614
ALL:
To lasting love.

18:01.648 --> 18:04.151
(applause)

18:11.158 --> 18:13.393
COOKIE: You lost him?
CLAUDIA: I know. It's very bad.

18:13.426 --> 18:14.461
And I want you to know

18:14.494 --> 18:16.396
nothing like this has ever
happened to me before.

18:16.429 --> 18:18.398
It's... uh,
he was giving me signs

18:18.431 --> 18:19.866
and I miscalculated and...
Please, please.

18:19.899 --> 18:21.268
Shh!

18:21.301 --> 18:22.735
Shh. Sit your nervous ass down.

18:22.769 --> 18:24.737
You're making me nervous.
Porsha, get in here!

18:28.308 --> 18:30.543
Cookie, all the media outlets
on hold...
Bump 'em.

18:30.577 --> 18:32.445
We bumped 'em twice already.

18:32.479 --> 18:34.581
Bump them again, Porsha.

18:34.614 --> 18:35.882
Lucious...

18:35.915 --> 18:38.218
ran off, we can't find him.

18:38.251 --> 18:39.719
You want me
to call the cops?
Yes.

18:39.752 --> 18:42.555
No! Do not!
We don't need

18:42.589 --> 18:44.857
that kind of attention
from the police, all right?

18:44.891 --> 18:46.426
Porsha, please get out.
Thank you.

18:48.295 --> 18:50.563
Okay. All right.

18:50.597 --> 18:52.332
What triggered him, huh?

18:52.365 --> 18:54.434
What did he see,
what did you say?

18:54.467 --> 18:56.636
What?
We were at Clem's Joint.

18:56.669 --> 18:58.805
And Clem was... I don't know,

18:58.838 --> 19:01.208
he was talking about
a music producer that

19:01.241 --> 19:02.409
he was there with
all the time, uh...

19:02.442 --> 19:04.611
Eddie! Eddie Barker!
Yes!

19:04.644 --> 19:05.745
Porsha, get in here!
Get in here, Porsha!

19:05.778 --> 19:07.314
Who you need me to bump?

19:07.347 --> 19:08.948
No, don't bump.
I just need you to get

19:08.981 --> 19:10.650
Eddie Barker on the phone.
I think that's where Lucious is.

19:10.683 --> 19:13.586
I'm sure of it.
(scoffs)

19:13.620 --> 19:14.821
Uh, you know what?
(snaps fingers)

19:14.854 --> 19:16.223
I have the number.

19:16.256 --> 19:18.191
Looks like I'm doing
everybody's job today.

19:18.225 --> 19:19.926
If there's an address,
I can just go over and get him.
COOKIE: No.

19:19.959 --> 19:22.329
See, Lucious is with Eddie.

19:22.362 --> 19:24.697
He's with family.

19:24.731 --> 19:27.400
That's what's gonna
get him back.

19:27.434 --> 19:30.437
Don't know why
I hired you.

19:30.470 --> 19:32.672
* I will ride for you

19:32.705 --> 19:35.375
* For you
* With no destination

19:35.408 --> 19:37.944
* I would die a thousand times
* For you

19:37.977 --> 19:41.914
* With no hesitation

19:41.948 --> 19:44.817
* You, you, you, hey

19:44.851 --> 19:46.853
* You, you, you

19:46.886 --> 19:49.389
* You, you,
you *

19:49.422 --> 19:51.791
* I been looking for

19:51.824 --> 19:53.860
* You, you, you

19:53.893 --> 19:56.329
* Oh, you, you, you

19:56.363 --> 19:57.364
* Hey

19:57.397 --> 19:58.698
* You, you, you...

19:58.731 --> 20:01.000
What the hell is this?

20:01.033 --> 20:03.536
* Yeah.

20:03.570 --> 20:04.971
Becky, baby, come on.

20:05.004 --> 20:06.739
(laughs)
What's good?

20:06.773 --> 20:08.308
Hey, Jamal.

20:08.341 --> 20:09.642
(laughs)

20:09.676 --> 20:12.312
So, this sounds like
a completely different song.

20:12.345 --> 20:14.314
Yes, it is.
Yes, it is.

20:14.347 --> 20:15.982
But listen, we just,
I don't know,

20:16.015 --> 20:17.550
we were feeling something
different, so we just

20:17.584 --> 20:18.651
stripped it all away
and started from scratch.

20:18.685 --> 20:21.288
All right. Boy, get out here
so we can talk about this.

20:21.321 --> 20:22.889
JAMAL:
"Boy, get out here"?

20:22.922 --> 20:26.693
Why you barking at me like
you're my mama or something?

20:26.726 --> 20:29.929
Jamal, why would you construct
an entirely different song?

20:29.962 --> 20:32.699
Why would I construct
an entirely better song?

20:32.732 --> 20:34.467
I mean, it's dope.

20:34.501 --> 20:35.902
And Warren loves it,
I love it.

20:35.935 --> 20:37.970
Jake's gonna love it.
What?

20:38.004 --> 20:39.972
The contracts are already signed
on the other song.

20:40.006 --> 20:42.041
What is this?
WARREN: Becky, if you
just listen to the song,

20:42.074 --> 20:43.510
you'll understand
why Jamal is...

20:43.543 --> 20:45.645
Warren, no disrespect,

20:45.678 --> 20:47.547
but please mind
your damn business

20:47.580 --> 20:48.881
because this is about
our business, all right?

20:48.915 --> 20:50.049
JAMAL:
Whoa, Becky.

20:50.082 --> 20:51.551
No disrespect,
but you're forgetting

20:51.584 --> 20:53.520
that you are interim A&R.
Interim.

20:53.553 --> 20:56.956
So I don't need to explain
my music to you or anyone else.

20:56.989 --> 20:59.292
You're really
tripping right now.

20:59.326 --> 21:03.062
* You were the girl
that changed my world... *

21:03.095 --> 21:05.998
(laughs)
How that rehab going?

21:07.600 --> 21:09.536
* You lit the fuse...

21:09.569 --> 21:11.738
Taking it one
step at a time.

21:11.771 --> 21:13.473
EDDIE:
Let me tell you.

21:13.506 --> 21:16.476
There was no shortage
of shorties back in the day

21:16.509 --> 21:17.677
with Lucious Lyon.

21:17.710 --> 21:19.879
Even when you
was broke as a joke.

21:19.912 --> 21:25.585
Y'all remember the, um, Lucious
Lyon Triple Takedown, right?

21:25.618 --> 21:29.055
You know, you get 'em
hot and working with, um,

21:29.088 --> 21:33.059
"On the Grind," and
then-then you get them,

21:33.092 --> 21:35.928
get them loose with
"I'm-a Make You Mine."

21:35.962 --> 21:38.398
* Baby, I could
make you mine *
* You mine.

21:38.431 --> 21:39.432
(laughter)

21:39.466 --> 21:41.368
MAN:
* Come on.

21:41.401 --> 21:43.069
That was my cut, man.

21:43.102 --> 21:46.939
But then the killer was
I get them freaky with...

21:48.408 --> 21:50.410
..."Pretty Little Thing."
"Hot Little Thing."

21:50.443 --> 21:53.045
"Hot Little Thing."
I love that.

21:53.079 --> 21:54.447
Why don't you tell
these gentlemen

21:54.481 --> 21:56.483
the story of the trunk?

21:56.516 --> 21:58.918
No, you tell them.

21:58.951 --> 22:01.421
You tell it better than I do.

22:01.454 --> 22:02.989
Before I was writing
and producing hits,

22:03.022 --> 22:04.023
I was spinning records.

22:04.056 --> 22:06.559
That's how I met Lucious.

22:06.593 --> 22:10.430
I was the first one in New York
to play his songs.

22:10.463 --> 22:11.831
And there was this...

22:11.864 --> 22:13.866
program director,

22:13.900 --> 22:16.736
yeah, with the high-top fade;
it was turned the wrong way.

22:16.769 --> 22:19.372
Guy wouldn't play a song
unless you hit him off.

22:19.406 --> 22:21.474
So, I'm telling Lu,
"See, look, Lu,

22:21.508 --> 22:23.476
"got to give him
some more paper.

22:23.510 --> 22:24.744
"You know, don't be cheap.

22:24.777 --> 22:26.379
Just get his attention.
This is your career."

22:26.413 --> 22:27.547
(laughing):
And so Lucious,

22:27.580 --> 22:30.950
he goes down to the station,

22:30.983 --> 22:33.119
and he waits for
the program director to come out

22:33.152 --> 22:35.588
and as soon as the
program director comes out, bam.

22:35.622 --> 22:38.758
(laughing): Whoa.
EDDIE: Hits him in the nose.

22:38.791 --> 22:41.127
(laughing): He messed up
his whole face. Ah, man.

22:41.160 --> 22:44.864
And then, he grabbed this clown
by his Kid 'n Play hairdo...

22:44.897 --> 22:46.766
(laughs)
And he throws him

22:46.799 --> 22:47.967
into the trunk,

22:48.000 --> 22:48.968
closes the trunk.

22:49.001 --> 22:50.670
He starts driving
around the town,

22:50.703 --> 22:51.738
slamming on the brakes.
(yelling)

22:51.771 --> 22:53.640
Bam! The guy's like, "Oh!"

22:53.673 --> 22:55.875
Bam.
(high-pitched ringing)

22:55.908 --> 22:57.877
(echoing laughter)
EDDIE (muffled):
You can hear the guy

22:57.910 --> 22:59.912
screaming from his car.

22:59.946 --> 23:02.081
Whoa, whoa, man.
(people gasping)

23:02.114 --> 23:04.551
You all right?

23:06.519 --> 23:08.387
Sorry, I don't know
what happened.

23:13.860 --> 23:16.729
Mrs. Calhoun has been afraid
to come forward

23:16.763 --> 23:19.499
with the particular details
pertaining to her defense.

23:19.532 --> 23:20.867
Why?

23:20.900 --> 23:21.968
Because she fears
for her life.

23:22.001 --> 23:22.969
From who?

23:23.002 --> 23:24.604
From who? Who?

23:24.637 --> 23:26.673
From the FBI, that's who.

23:26.706 --> 23:28.908
Because no action was ever taken
against Agent Cousins

23:28.941 --> 23:31.678
after he became obsessed
with Lucious Lyon

23:31.711 --> 23:33.145
and then repeatedly,

23:33.179 --> 23:36.983
repeatedly stalked and
assaulted his former wife.

23:37.016 --> 23:38.084
Oh, have a gander.

23:40.019 --> 23:42.088
I was caught
in a nightmare

23:42.121 --> 23:44.123
and they did nothing to stop it.

23:44.156 --> 23:48.194
Mr. Rawlings, these photos
have no bearing in the murder

23:48.227 --> 23:50.129
of Agent Cousins.
THIRSTY: "No bearings."

23:50.162 --> 23:51.731
(laughing): Okay.

23:51.764 --> 23:54.567
So, what you're saying is
"there needs no ghost

23:54.601 --> 23:56.703
come from the grave"
to speak on this.

23:56.736 --> 23:58.605
TARIQ:
Are you scared of me?

23:58.638 --> 24:00.139
ANIKA:
Tariq, please don't hurt me.

24:00.172 --> 24:01.541
TARIQ: I been waiting
all night for this.

24:01.574 --> 24:03.743
ANIKA:
Tariq, no. Let me go!

24:03.776 --> 24:05.845
How do they say over at the FBI?

24:05.878 --> 24:07.079
"Lordy, I hope there's tapes."

24:07.113 --> 24:08.648
Well, there are and I have them.

24:08.681 --> 24:10.950
He forced himself onto me.

24:10.983 --> 24:14.754
He wanted me to run away
with him, but I refused.

24:14.787 --> 24:17.990
(sighs)
He was so angry.

24:18.024 --> 24:21.528
And-and he tried
to kill me, so I...

24:21.561 --> 24:23.162
No, no, it's okay.
Shh, shh, shh.

24:23.195 --> 24:25.632
It's okay.
(cries)

24:25.665 --> 24:27.066
That's self-defense.

24:27.099 --> 24:29.168
Self-defense.

24:29.201 --> 24:31.504
Now, you do me a favor.
You take this to trial.

24:31.538 --> 24:33.105
There'll be no conviction.

24:33.139 --> 24:35.708
There's not a jury in the world
that will find her guilty.

24:35.742 --> 24:37.644
As a professional courtesy,

24:37.677 --> 24:39.646
attorney to attorney,
I got to say,

24:39.679 --> 24:41.681
I would hate to be
in your shoes right now,

24:41.714 --> 24:43.716
'cause you look like you
just stepped in... (laughs)

24:46.586 --> 24:47.954
Well, you know.

24:47.987 --> 24:50.022
(door closes)

24:50.056 --> 24:54.894
(playing "I Don't Want to
Be Right" by Luther Ingram)

25:03.102 --> 25:06.906
* If loving you is wrong

25:06.939 --> 25:10.977
* I don't want to be right

25:11.010 --> 25:14.313
* If being right means
being without you *

25:14.346 --> 25:17.116
* I'd rather live
a wrongdoing life *

25:17.149 --> 25:20.753
* Your mama and daddy
say it's a shame *

25:20.787 --> 25:24.591
* It's a downright disgrace

25:24.624 --> 25:26.926
(door opens)
* As long as I got you

25:26.959 --> 25:28.628
* By my side

25:28.661 --> 25:32.264
* I don't care
what your people say *

25:32.298 --> 25:35.267
* Your friends tell you
it's no future *

25:35.301 --> 25:38.104
* In loving a married man

25:38.137 --> 25:41.874
* If I can't see you
when I want *

25:41.908 --> 25:44.010
* I'll see you when I can...

25:44.043 --> 25:45.311
Come on, Cookie.

25:45.344 --> 25:48.815
* If loving you is wrong

25:48.848 --> 25:52.284
BOTH:
* I don't want to be right

25:52.318 --> 25:55.021
* If loving you is wrong

25:55.054 --> 25:59.358
* I don't want to be right

25:59.391 --> 26:02.294
* I don't want
to be right *

26:02.328 --> 26:05.732
* If it means
being without you *

26:05.765 --> 26:09.135
* I don't want to be right

26:09.168 --> 26:14.106
* If it means
being without you. *

26:16.643 --> 26:18.277
Amazing.
You still got it.

26:18.310 --> 26:20.146
(laughs)
EDDIE: Hey.

26:20.179 --> 26:22.114
COOKIE: Good to see you.
EDDIE: It's good to see you.

26:22.148 --> 26:23.716
CLAUDIA:
Excuse me.

26:23.750 --> 26:25.652
Dwight.

26:25.685 --> 26:27.019
We have dinner by the pool.

26:27.053 --> 26:30.890
Eddie.

26:30.923 --> 26:34.727
Thank you for
everything today.

26:34.761 --> 26:36.062
You're a really good friend.

26:36.095 --> 26:38.164
I'll call you
later, all right?

26:38.197 --> 26:39.732
Mm-hmm.

26:49.241 --> 26:51.177
(sighs)

26:51.210 --> 26:53.880
He doesn't
remember me, Cook.

26:53.913 --> 26:55.147
Doesn't remember anything.

26:55.181 --> 26:58.050
Oh, no.
It's just Lucious.

26:58.084 --> 27:01.020
He-he forgets stuff, but
it d-doesn't mean anything.

27:01.053 --> 27:04.023
You know what, I-I've known him
for half of his life.

27:04.056 --> 27:06.058
And maybe you want
to keep a lid on things,

27:06.092 --> 27:07.960
but you don't have
to do that with me.

27:07.994 --> 27:10.062
(sighs)

27:13.232 --> 27:15.201
He has a traumatic brain injury.

27:15.234 --> 27:17.236
He can't remember anything.

27:17.269 --> 27:19.071
Not even you?

27:19.105 --> 27:21.373
Only the family knows,
so, please, Eddie,

27:21.407 --> 27:23.075
can you keep this between us?

27:23.109 --> 27:25.211
Of course.

27:27.213 --> 27:29.181
How you holding up?

27:29.215 --> 27:30.717
You all right?

27:30.750 --> 27:32.251
Hey, we're good.
We're grinding.

27:32.284 --> 27:34.854
Empire is making money, but
Andre tells me not for long.

27:34.887 --> 27:37.356
I mean, soon we're gonna have
to start liquidating our assets

27:37.389 --> 27:39.358
and I don't know
how long we can keep

27:39.391 --> 27:41.861
Lucious's condition
on the low.
No, we're not, you...

27:41.894 --> 27:43.229
Don't liquidate nothing.

27:43.262 --> 27:45.331
This is just a rough patch.

27:45.364 --> 27:49.368
What do our families
do when, uh,

27:49.401 --> 27:52.138
a loved one
is sick or dying?

27:52.171 --> 27:54.306
We step up.
Bring a cake.

27:54.340 --> 27:56.709
A pie.
(laughs)
(scoffs)

27:56.743 --> 27:59.011
Casserole, baked ham.
(laughs)

27:59.045 --> 28:02.815
You need to...
need to get those artists

28:02.849 --> 28:04.483
and they need
to hold you up.

28:04.516 --> 28:06.152
They need to support this.

28:06.185 --> 28:07.887
Uh, with what? Food?

28:07.920 --> 28:09.288
With music.

28:09.321 --> 28:12.759
That's what
Lucious would want.

28:12.792 --> 28:14.226
Music.

28:16.228 --> 28:18.230
Thank you, Eddie.

28:18.264 --> 28:20.933
(chuckles)

28:20.967 --> 28:24.270
COOKIE: Child, if it's gonna
rain, move the event inside.

28:24.303 --> 28:26.472
Okay? Don't be so slow.

28:28.307 --> 28:32.144
Hey, let me call
you back, Porsha.

28:32.178 --> 28:33.479
Hello.

28:33.512 --> 28:35.314
The hell are you doing
going through my drawers?

28:35.347 --> 28:37.083
You ain't even supposed to be
on this side of the house.

28:37.116 --> 28:39.051
I need your gun.
For what?

28:39.085 --> 28:40.887
We have to put an
end to that witch

28:40.920 --> 28:43.322
poisoning my Dwight
with her spells.

28:43.355 --> 28:45.224
Spells. Woman...

28:45.257 --> 28:47.459
Look, you gonna
meet a real witch

28:47.493 --> 28:49.095
you go through
my drawers again.

28:49.128 --> 28:51.798
Get yourself out of here.
No one comes between us

28:51.831 --> 28:53.399
and our family.

28:53.432 --> 28:55.935
If they do,
we cut them down

28:55.968 --> 28:58.204
like I did that bastard Tariq.

29:00.206 --> 29:01.507
What did you say?

29:01.540 --> 29:05.044
I put that bastard in the dirt

29:05.077 --> 29:07.479
and I sent that whore
to prison for it.

29:07.513 --> 29:09.548
I wouldn't think twice

29:09.581 --> 29:13.352
about bleeding that
new witch to death.

29:13.385 --> 29:15.788
Good night, Cookie.

29:19.258 --> 29:21.994
TORY:
* Wan-na

29:22.028 --> 29:23.429
* Feel

29:23.462 --> 29:28.801
* Ap-prec-i-ated

29:28.835 --> 29:32.171
* Oh, oh

29:32.204 --> 29:35.875
* Am I asking too much?

29:35.908 --> 29:37.844
* I wanna feel...

29:37.877 --> 29:39.245
(laughing):
Jamal, Jamal.

29:39.278 --> 29:41.413
You are a genius.
The changes you made

29:41.447 --> 29:42.815
to give Tory the vocals.

29:42.849 --> 29:45.017
It's-it's perfect.

29:45.051 --> 29:46.352
Thank you so much.

29:46.385 --> 29:47.887
I love it.

29:47.920 --> 29:50.857
I really hope
that you like it.

29:50.890 --> 29:53.359
Tory, let's go eat,
talk music videos.

29:53.392 --> 29:55.027
(song stops)

29:57.063 --> 29:59.131
Look, I understand the way
you must feel right now.

29:59.165 --> 30:02.902
So, you've had your best friend
backstab you like that before?

30:02.935 --> 30:06.205
And take away something
that's not theirs to take?

30:06.238 --> 30:07.940
Jamal, this is the song
that he wanted.

30:07.974 --> 30:09.842
I don't know
what you want me to do.

30:09.876 --> 30:12.178
This is my job.
Oh, your job?

30:14.113 --> 30:16.048
Pull some foolishness
like this again,

30:16.082 --> 30:19.418
you won't have a
job at my label.

30:27.226 --> 30:30.129
This way, Ms. Walker.

30:37.436 --> 30:39.906
(door closes)

30:41.974 --> 30:43.943
Who are these people?

30:45.211 --> 30:46.612
Leah.

30:46.645 --> 30:49.581
I think it's time
for you to take a break.

30:49.615 --> 30:51.517
We think you should
get some rest.

30:51.550 --> 30:53.485
Okay?
CLAUDIA: We found a...

30:53.519 --> 30:55.421
a lovely facility for you.

30:55.454 --> 30:58.090
Uh, it's considered the best
in the state and Dr. Givens

30:58.124 --> 31:00.526
is gonna be handling
your care from now on.

31:00.559 --> 31:05.531
Did this witch put a hex
on your tongue?

31:05.564 --> 31:09.268
Or are you going
to sit there

31:09.301 --> 31:13.205
and let them lock me up?

31:13.239 --> 31:15.474
Answer me!

31:17.343 --> 31:20.879
We have an involuntary
commitment contract.

31:36.595 --> 31:39.631
COOKIE (whispers):
It's okay.

31:49.508 --> 31:52.644
I know there'll be
an evaluation period.

31:53.745 --> 31:55.047
I'm sorry, I know
that this must be...

31:55.081 --> 31:57.116
You go back to hell, bitch!

31:57.149 --> 31:58.650
Get off of her!

31:58.684 --> 32:00.119
Bitch!

32:00.152 --> 32:01.387
COOKIE:
No, no, get her off.

32:03.055 --> 32:04.423
(coughs)

32:04.456 --> 32:06.058
I know you're in there.

32:06.092 --> 32:08.260
I know what you are.
You're a monster!

32:08.294 --> 32:11.063
From the day you were born,

32:11.097 --> 32:14.700
I tried to exorcise
that evil in you,

32:14.733 --> 32:18.670
but it just got
bigger and stronger.

32:32.318 --> 32:34.653
(door closes)

32:39.758 --> 32:42.528
Hey. I'm Detective Mitchell.

32:42.561 --> 32:44.530
Las Vegas Metro.
This is Detective Lumley.

32:44.563 --> 32:45.998
How you doing?

32:46.032 --> 32:48.334
Detective Pamela Rose.

32:48.367 --> 32:51.237
I'm the NYPD liaison.
I'm just here to facilitate.

32:51.270 --> 32:53.139
MITCHELL: We'll keep
this short, Mr. Lyon.

32:53.172 --> 32:56.442
We've been unable to
locate Giuliana Green.

32:56.475 --> 32:57.576
We're wondering if you
have any ideas as to

32:57.609 --> 32:58.744
where she might have fled.

32:58.777 --> 33:02.648
Does she own any
properties abroad?

33:02.681 --> 33:04.550
(sighs)

33:07.453 --> 33:09.488
Mr. Lyon?

33:09.521 --> 33:12.424
No. I don't, um,
I don't know.

33:12.458 --> 33:14.326
Any associates
who might be hiding her?

33:14.360 --> 33:16.295
I never knew of any associates

33:16.328 --> 33:18.297
outside of her dealings
with the casino operations.

33:18.330 --> 33:20.266
I wish I could help you.

33:20.299 --> 33:21.467
THIRSTY:
Look, uh, this investigation

33:21.500 --> 33:22.701
is of the utmost importance

33:22.734 --> 33:24.370
to the Lyon's family, so,

33:24.403 --> 33:27.073
any way we can be helpful,
give us a call.

33:27.106 --> 33:29.375
24-7.
MITCHELL: All right.

33:29.408 --> 33:30.776
Thank you for your time,
Mr. Lyon.

33:30.809 --> 33:32.611
Yeah,
I'll-I'll walk you guys out.

33:32.644 --> 33:34.613
I thought you had an eye
on Giuliana.

33:34.646 --> 33:36.482
The other night...

33:36.515 --> 33:39.251
what was that?

33:39.285 --> 33:40.619
Are you trying to set me up?

33:40.652 --> 33:42.221
No, I didn't even know
who you were.

33:42.254 --> 33:44.123
I was just briefed on the
investigation this morning.

33:44.156 --> 33:46.392
So, it was a coincidence?

33:46.425 --> 33:48.527
May I ask you a question,
Detective?

33:48.560 --> 33:52.164
Do you often have sex
with strangers in bars?

33:52.198 --> 33:53.299
(chuckles)
We didn't have sex

33:53.332 --> 33:55.234
because you couldn't get it up.

33:55.267 --> 33:57.436
Huh.

34:01.740 --> 34:03.442
COOKIE: How did things go
with the boys?

34:03.475 --> 34:06.378
I'd like to think we're still
making music up in this bitch.

34:06.412 --> 34:08.347
So, Hakeem just delivered
a really dope track,

34:08.380 --> 34:09.715
and I'll start the
campaign around it

34:09.748 --> 34:12.218
as soon as you sign off.
Mm-hmm.

34:12.251 --> 34:14.286
And Jamal is
a different story.

34:14.320 --> 34:15.654
What?

34:15.687 --> 34:18.390
So, we had very
specific instructions

34:18.424 --> 34:20.659
and notes, and a deadline
from the producer,

34:20.692 --> 34:22.761
but Jamal refused
to make any changes,

34:22.794 --> 34:24.663
so I replaced his vocals

34:24.696 --> 34:26.732
with Tory's.

34:31.270 --> 34:32.738
(sighs) I know.
I feel like dirt.

34:32.771 --> 34:35.674
Well, what did
the producer think?
He loved it.

34:35.707 --> 34:37.876
He threw in half
a million for marketing,

34:37.909 --> 34:40.579
and he also agreed
to finance the video.

34:42.181 --> 34:45.351
Look, Becky,
I know you love Jamal,

34:45.384 --> 34:47.253
and I know that was
very hard to do.

34:47.286 --> 34:49.621
But don't let your heart
step on your ambition.

34:49.655 --> 34:52.624
I need strong people
around me now more than ever.

34:52.658 --> 34:54.360
Porsha, get legal
on the phone.

34:54.393 --> 34:57.463
Have them remove "interim"
from Becky's title.

34:57.496 --> 35:00.466
Bump her salary
30% as well.

35:00.499 --> 35:03.302
Uh, thank you,
thank you. Look,

35:03.335 --> 35:04.770
I will not let you down.

35:04.803 --> 35:06.205
You better not.

35:06.238 --> 35:08.607
COOKIE:
Hello. Thank you.

35:08.640 --> 35:11.877
(cheers and applause)

35:11.910 --> 35:15.347
Thank you.

35:15.381 --> 35:17.916
20 years ago,
an Empire was born.

35:17.949 --> 35:20.486
It may not have had
thousands of employees

35:20.519 --> 35:24.223
or gold records or high-rises
on both sides of the country,

35:24.256 --> 35:28.594
but there was always music
and family and love.

35:30.396 --> 35:31.563
ANDRE: Here comes
our announcement.

35:31.597 --> 35:33.565
While Lucious continues
his sabbatical,

35:33.599 --> 35:36.768
we will honor his legacy
with a bold new project

35:36.802 --> 35:38.470
that has his blessing.

35:38.504 --> 35:41.940
Starting immediately,
we will produce and release

35:41.973 --> 35:45.277
a new album for every year
we have been in operation.

35:45.311 --> 35:46.912
So, you do the math.

35:46.945 --> 35:49.415
That's 20 new albums
to be completed

35:49.448 --> 35:50.916
by the end of the year--
we can do it.
MAN: What?

35:50.949 --> 35:53.585
The Empire 20 For 20.

35:53.619 --> 35:54.686
It's who we are,
it's what we do,

35:54.720 --> 35:55.721
and it's worth fighting for.

35:55.754 --> 35:58.257
Thank you.

35:58.290 --> 35:59.925
(cheers and applause)
REPORTER: Cookie, how do you
expect to pull this feat off?

35:59.958 --> 36:01.727
REPORTER 2: Who's gonna be
the first artist on the album?

36:01.760 --> 36:03.929
Can you tell us that?

36:03.962 --> 36:05.797
You ambush the sale,

36:05.831 --> 36:07.766
embarrass me
in front of the board,

36:07.799 --> 36:09.335
and you lied.

36:09.368 --> 36:11.203
You lied to me and
everybody else in there.

36:11.237 --> 36:13.405
Calm down, Andre,
I did not lie.

36:13.439 --> 36:14.906
You're gonna sit there
and tell me

36:14.940 --> 36:17.309
that Pop gave you his blessing
on this crazy-ass plan?

36:17.343 --> 36:19.211
The man doesn't even
know his own damn name.

36:19.245 --> 36:22.381
Andre, your father would
want Empire to grow,

36:22.414 --> 36:24.350
to make more music,
not be chopped up

36:24.383 --> 36:26.352
like a hoopty
and sold for parts.

36:26.385 --> 36:29.221
The success of one album
pays for the creation

36:29.255 --> 36:30.656
and campaign of the next.

36:30.689 --> 36:33.359
Now, how do you expect
us to produce 20 albums

36:33.392 --> 36:34.660
with nothing coming in, Ma?

36:34.693 --> 36:35.661
We will make it happen.

36:35.694 --> 36:37.796
You mean me!

36:39.965 --> 36:42.301
I'm the one that always
has to find the money,

36:42.334 --> 36:45.304
always has to make the deal,
always has to make it work.

36:45.337 --> 36:48.006
Me, not you!
Not Jamal,

36:48.039 --> 36:50.642
not Hakeem, not Pop-- me!

36:50.676 --> 36:52.978
Okay, I need you to calm down.

36:53.011 --> 36:55.414
You see, I birthed
and breastfed your ass

36:55.447 --> 36:58.517
into this world,
so I deserve some respect.

36:58.550 --> 37:01.253
Not only that, Andre,
I'm your boss, okay?

37:01.287 --> 37:03.722
So the next time you want to
barge in here and pop off,

37:03.755 --> 37:05.324
dust your résumé off, okay,

37:05.357 --> 37:07.926
because I know your father
did not accept

37:07.959 --> 37:10.662
that kind of insubordination.
Insubordination...

37:10.696 --> 37:11.930
And I won't either!

37:11.963 --> 37:14.766
Go home, Andre.

37:14.800 --> 37:17.269
(chuckles):
I see where this is going.

37:17.303 --> 37:20.272
Go home. I will talk
to you in the morning

37:20.306 --> 37:22.474
about the 20 For 20 budget.
(bat drops)

37:39.525 --> 37:41.960
Uh, can I get you
anything, boss?
No! No.

37:44.796 --> 37:46.332
Thank you, Porsha.

37:50.402 --> 37:52.604
You know, you over there
looking like a queen.

37:52.638 --> 37:55.974
How's that, Porsha?
Sitting on the throne
all by yourself.

38:01.513 --> 38:03.482
(Cookie sighs)

38:03.515 --> 38:05.751
(thunder rumbles)

38:16.127 --> 38:18.364
It's hard to trust people,
you know?

38:20.466 --> 38:23.802
Kind of get used to
being alone, and...

38:25.637 --> 38:27.038
...you feel like you're
strong enough to do it

38:27.072 --> 38:30.342
all by yourself,
but that's not true.

38:30.376 --> 38:33.011
'Cause I do want somebody
to believe in me, you know?

38:33.044 --> 38:35.647
I want to believe
in someone else.

38:37.716 --> 38:39.785
Jamal, I believe in you.

38:48.594 --> 38:50.896
And I believe in this.

38:53.131 --> 38:55.501
* I will ride for you

38:55.534 --> 38:58.904
* No destination

38:58.937 --> 39:02.808
* But it don't mean nothin'
if I don't got you *

39:02.841 --> 39:05.877
* Beside me

39:05.911 --> 39:11.483
* You got me singin'
love, love, love *

39:11.517 --> 39:14.453
* Tell me where you been
all my life... *

39:14.486 --> 39:17.656
Come on, baby.

39:17.689 --> 39:20.659
* 'Cause I been lookin' for
(piano plays)

39:20.692 --> 39:22.528
BOTH:
* You, you, you

39:22.561 --> 39:25.464
* You, you, you

39:25.497 --> 39:27.132
* You, you,
you *

39:27.165 --> 39:30.436
* I been lookin' for

39:30.469 --> 39:32.904
* You, you, you
* Oh

39:35.441 --> 39:37.576
* You, you, you

39:37.609 --> 39:40.712
* I been lookin' for

39:40.746 --> 39:42.748
* Yeah

39:42.781 --> 39:45.150
* I been lookin' for you

39:45.183 --> 39:46.852
* Mm-hmm

39:46.885 --> 39:48.987
(thunder rumbles)

39:49.020 --> 39:51.557
* If you call my phone

39:51.590 --> 39:53.492
* I'll always answer

39:53.525 --> 39:56.695
* People come and go

39:56.728 --> 39:57.996
* I'll be there forever

39:58.029 --> 39:59.431
(exhales)

39:59.465 --> 40:00.832
* 'Cause it don't mean nothin'

40:00.866 --> 40:03.535
* If I don't got you
beside me *

40:03.569 --> 40:05.871
* Now, said it don't
mean nothin' *

40:05.904 --> 40:08.039
* If I don't got you
to guide me *

40:08.073 --> 40:12.210
* Love, love, love

40:12.243 --> 40:14.980
* Tell me where you
been all my life *

40:15.013 --> 40:18.083
* Where you been
all my life *

40:18.116 --> 40:22.053
* You got me sayin'
love, love, love *

40:22.087 --> 40:24.856
* Tell me where you been
all my life *

40:24.890 --> 40:26.525
* Oh

40:26.558 --> 40:28.093
* You
* 'Cause I been lookin' for

40:28.126 --> 40:30.562
* Hey, you, you, you

40:30.596 --> 40:32.464
* I been looking' for you

40:32.498 --> 40:34.132
* You, you, you
* I been lookin' for you

40:34.165 --> 40:35.233
* You, you, you

40:35.266 --> 40:37.836
* No, no

40:37.869 --> 40:40.606
* Hey
* You, you, you

40:40.639 --> 40:42.874
* For you, you, you, you,
you, you, you *
* You, you, you

40:42.908 --> 40:46.077
* You
* You, you, you

40:46.111 --> 40:48.246
* I been lookin' for

40:48.279 --> 40:50.649
* You.

40:53.151 --> 40:55.954
(thunder cracks loudly)

41:02.828 --> 41:04.195
(grunts)

41:04.229 --> 41:07.065
(panting)

41:09.801 --> 41:12.003
Dwight, what are you
doing up? Are you okay?

41:13.304 --> 41:15.907
What are you doing?

41:15.941 --> 41:18.544
Are you g-going?
You leaving?

41:18.577 --> 41:23.214
It's... it's time for me to go.

41:23.248 --> 41:27.218
I've made arrangements for
someone else to come in.

41:27.252 --> 41:30.221
Is this because I ran off
the other day?

41:30.255 --> 41:31.957
That had nothing to do with you.
No, no.

41:31.990 --> 41:35.794
I was trying to figure out
who I am.
Dwight, Dwight.

41:35.827 --> 41:38.797
This only works
if there's trust.

41:38.830 --> 41:41.166
And I can't do what I do best

41:41.199 --> 41:44.035
without complete trust.

41:44.069 --> 41:45.971
And I don't think you trust me.

41:46.004 --> 41:50.208
You're the only one
that I do trust.

41:55.080 --> 41:57.549
I'm sorry, Dwight.

41:57.583 --> 41:59.585
(panting)

42:08.326 --> 42:11.663
You know, when I woke up
in that hospital...

42:13.799 --> 42:17.335
...I didn't remember who I was.

42:17.368 --> 42:19.705
But I looked up
and I saw your face,

42:19.738 --> 42:22.641
and I felt safe.

42:23.975 --> 42:26.244
Maybe for the first time
in my life.

42:26.277 --> 42:30.148
And I know if you leave...

42:30.181 --> 42:32.918
I won't be safe again.

42:35.320 --> 42:38.690
I'll be stuck in a world
full of demons,

42:38.724 --> 42:41.159
and they're gonna
turn me into a monster

42:41.192 --> 42:43.595
that I never wanted to be
in the first place.

42:45.396 --> 42:48.800
Please, please
don't leave me.

42:52.103 --> 42:54.172
Please.

43:18.897 --> 43:21.332
(whispering):
It's okay.

43:21.366 --> 43:24.402
I'm not gonna go.

43:24.435 --> 43:26.972
(thunder cracks loudly)

44:02.173 --> 44:03.775
Yeah.

Now that Empire
has you all fired up,

44:10.148 --> 44:12.751
here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

44:15.887 --> 44:18.389
* Hey-ay-ay *

44:18.423 --> 44:21.292
