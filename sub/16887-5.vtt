00:05.100 --> 00:06.700
Stu Brewster here,
and I'd like you all

00:06.700 --> 00:11.700
to meet Jeffery Barnes, the new
Missile Command world champ.
SAN FERNANO VALLEY, 1983

00:11.700 --> 00:12.900
VALLEY VIDEO GAME
CHAMPIONSHIPS

00:13.300 --> 00:14.600
Thanks for
joining us, Jeff.

00:14.600 --> 00:15.800
My pleasure, Stu.

00:15.800 --> 00:18.100
Now, Jeff,
you've dedicated the last

00:18.100 --> 00:21.100
three years of your life
to playing Missile Command.

00:21.200 --> 00:23.300
You've managed
to take a video game

00:23.300 --> 00:24.200
and raise it to a level

00:24.200 --> 00:26.700
that can only be
described as an art form.

00:26.700 --> 00:27.500
So let me ask

00:27.500 --> 00:29.800
the question on
everybody's mind:

00:30.300 --> 00:32.900
What's next
for Jeff Barnes?

00:33.900 --> 00:35.600
What's next? Uh...

00:37.000 --> 00:38.900
I hadn't really, uh...

00:42.900 --> 00:44.300
How can I make up my mind

00:44.300 --> 00:47.100
when I've got
so many tasty options?

00:50.100 --> 00:53.300
I've got so many tasty options.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.100
SAN FERNANDO VALLEY
25 YEARS LATER

00:58.900 --> 01:01.200
Jeff, please.

01:05.800 --> 01:07.000
There we go, buddy.

01:11.800 --> 01:13.200
Score.

01:13.500 --> 01:14.800
Powwow on the
sales floor.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.300
And one of you two idiots better
light a fire under Bartowski.

01:17.300 --> 01:18.800
He's late.

01:20.000 --> 01:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:34.800 --> 01:36.000
Aren't you
forgetting something?

01:42.000 --> 01:44.400
It's only the most important
meal of the day, bud.

01:44.700 --> 01:45.700
Of course!

01:46.300 --> 01:47.300
Breakfast.

01:47.800 --> 01:48.800
Thanks.

01:51.900 --> 01:52.600
What did I... What is that?

01:52.600 --> 01:53.600
What did I just drink?

01:53.800 --> 01:55.400
It's a ginseng
protein shake.

01:55.500 --> 01:56.600
Been used
thousands of years

01:56.600 --> 01:58.500
in the East
to promote Yang energy.

01:58.900 --> 02:00.000
And let me tell you, brother,

02:00.000 --> 02:02.400
it does wonders
for your wang energy.

02:02.400 --> 02:03.300
Great, thanks.

02:03.300 --> 02:04.500
Hey, where were you last night?

02:04.500 --> 02:05.900
We heard you come
stomping in at, like,

02:05.900 --> 02:07.200
4:00 in the morning.

02:07.200 --> 02:09.699
Yeah, oh, yeah, it was a...
it was a crazy night.

02:10.800 --> 02:13.100
Morgan and I stole a car,
and then we drove around

02:13.300 --> 02:16.400
shaking down liquor stores
and smacking around hookers.

02:16.800 --> 02:18.100
Relax, it's a video game.

02:18.200 --> 02:20.400
Oh, good... video games.

02:20.400 --> 02:21.600
Come on, El.
I mean, what's one night

02:21.600 --> 02:23.400
- of blowing off a little steam?
- One nights have

02:23.400 --> 02:24.500
a funny way of adding up.

02:24.500 --> 02:26.200
I mean, what's cool
when you're in college...

02:26.200 --> 02:27.500
We were just wondering...

02:27.800 --> 02:29.900
what happened
to all your big plans, bro?

02:30.000 --> 02:32.100
All that talk about
backpacking across Europe,

02:32.100 --> 02:34.100
or finishing
your college classes?

02:34.100 --> 02:36.900
You know, I just have a lot on
my plate at this precise moment.

02:36.900 --> 02:39.000
Well, like what, precisely?

02:39.900 --> 02:42.300
Chuck, we were happy when you
decided not to move out,

02:42.300 --> 02:45.300
but shouldn't your life
be moving somewhere?

02:45.500 --> 02:46.100
<i>It's time for you people</i>

02:46.100 --> 02:47.900
to get moving around here.

02:48.200 --> 02:49.700
Show some initiative!

02:50.400 --> 02:54.300
Well, I've got
just the guy to help.

02:55.400 --> 02:57.200
I'd like you to meet
Emmett Milbarge.

02:57.200 --> 02:59.600
Emmett here's an efficiency
expert, and he's been sent

02:59.600 --> 03:02.900
by Buy More corporate
to tighten your slack-asses up.

03:03.600 --> 03:06.300
Thank you for your very kind
words of introduction, Michael.

03:06.300 --> 03:07.600
I'll be in my office.

03:08.700 --> 03:12.100
Well, it is just
so nice to be here in...

03:14.800 --> 03:15.900
Burbank.

03:17.700 --> 03:19.700
Burbank, California.

03:20.200 --> 03:21.200
Just a real pleasure

03:21.200 --> 03:23.100
to meet all of you
in the flesh.

03:23.600 --> 03:24.200
I personally am

03:24.200 --> 03:25.600
looking forward
to spending more time here

03:25.600 --> 03:27.400
in the Buy More trenches,

03:27.800 --> 03:30.500
getting to know
the rank and the file.

03:30.800 --> 03:31.600
Unfortunately,
my visit here

03:31.600 --> 03:32.900
isn't going to be all fun.

03:33.500 --> 03:34.600
I'm going to be
interviewing you,

03:34.600 --> 03:36.900
and I'm going to be evaluating
you on your performance,

03:36.900 --> 03:38.500
And, perhaps, even...

03:39.100 --> 03:40.500
trimming the fat.

03:42.600 --> 03:45.200
So... who would like
to go first?

03:47.500 --> 03:48.800
We'll just start out simple.

03:49.300 --> 03:50.500
Why do you
belong at the Buy More?

03:50.500 --> 03:52.900
I satisfy a quota.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.800
My dad's part Indian.

03:54.900 --> 03:58.100
The cool kind of Indian,
though, not like Lester.

03:58.100 --> 03:59.900
I used to be
in management, myself,

03:59.900 --> 04:01.200
so I know how

04:01.200 --> 04:04.600
to grease the store's... cogs.

04:04.800 --> 04:06.900
- "Cogs"?
- Make sure they don't...

04:07.800 --> 04:09.300
squeak.

04:12.200 --> 04:13.600
If you know what I'm saying.

04:14.400 --> 04:15.700
ASS-KISSER

04:16.200 --> 04:18.100
Why do I belong at the Buy More?

04:18.100 --> 04:19.899
You know, I'm going to have
to think about that.

04:19.899 --> 04:21.399
I'm going to go
grab a soda.

04:21.500 --> 04:22.600
And... You want one?

04:22.600 --> 04:23.800
'Cause it's my treat.

04:23.900 --> 04:25.000
I'll gr- I'll grab you one.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.600
And I'll be back in a jiff.

04:28.800 --> 04:30.500
UNTRAINABLE

04:30.800 --> 04:34.000
I speak more than one language,
binary code.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.300
Zero, zero, zero, one,

04:36.300 --> 04:37.600
one, zero,

04:37.700 --> 04:40.800
one... zero.

04:41.300 --> 04:42.600
PROSTITUTE?

04:42.600 --> 04:43.900
What would I do?

04:44.700 --> 04:47.100
I'd just ask W-W-C-D?

04:47.400 --> 04:49.100
- "What would Chuck do?"
- Chuck?

04:49.100 --> 04:50.400
The chain of command?

04:50.600 --> 04:52.100
Well, there's, like, Chuck,

04:52.100 --> 04:53.000
and then there's, like,

04:53.000 --> 04:54.100
the rest of us.

04:54.300 --> 04:55.500
Oh, and then there's Jeff.

04:55.500 --> 04:58.500
Sometimes I... W-W-C-D-N?

04:58.500 --> 04:59.900
"Wonder what Chuck's doing now?"

04:59.900 --> 05:01.200
Who represents
the Buy More ideal?

05:01.200 --> 05:02.900
Who makes the trains
run on time?

05:02.900 --> 05:04.300
Who provides your moral compass?

05:04.300 --> 05:06.000
Who holds
the team together?

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
- Chuck.
- Chuck.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.100
Lester... no, Chuck.

05:09.100 --> 05:10.500
- Chuck.
- Well...

05:11.000 --> 05:14.300
I'm looking forward
to meeting this Chuck fella.

05:15.500 --> 05:16.800
If he ever decides to show up.

05:18.100 --> 05:20.100
Chuck, you picked one hell
of a morning to be late.

05:20.100 --> 05:22.300
- Yeah, crazy night, Morgan.
- Lover's tryst?

05:22.300 --> 05:23.500
Say no more.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.200
Unless you care to infuse
your story with a more

05:25.200 --> 05:27.300
tawdry level of detail?

05:27.600 --> 05:29.600
You don't. Okay, listen,
there's this efficiency guy

05:29.600 --> 05:30.800
who's been looking all over
for you, all right.

05:30.800 --> 05:33.100
So if he asks, you have
gallstone issues.

05:33.300 --> 05:34.500
- That's a thing, right?
- Morgan?

05:34.500 --> 05:35.600
Well, I had to think
on my feet here, Chuck.

05:35.600 --> 05:37.200
This Emmett guy's
been busting my...

05:39.000 --> 05:40.200
preconceptions.

05:40.500 --> 05:41.700
And helping me see the Buy More

05:41.700 --> 05:44.700
in a whole new...
Hey, hello!

05:44.900 --> 05:47.500
This is him... Chuck.

05:48.100 --> 05:49.100
We finally meet, Chuck.

05:49.100 --> 05:50.100
Hi.

05:54.300 --> 05:55.400
SOMALIA TRAINING CAMPS
DIRTY BOMB TRADE

05:55.400 --> 05:56.400
NUCLEAR WEAPONS TRAINING

06:00.800 --> 06:02.100
Are you feeling all right?

06:03.800 --> 06:04.800
No- yes!

06:05.000 --> 06:06.600
Yes, I'm fine.

06:07.300 --> 06:08.800
Actually on second thought,

06:09.100 --> 06:11.400
<i>I think my gallstones
are acting up, so...</i>

06:27.200 --> 06:28.300
Hi.

06:29.500 --> 06:30.600
Do you know this man?

06:34.100 --> 06:35.800
No. No, never

06:35.800 --> 06:37.300
seen him before
in my life.

06:37.400 --> 06:39.300
Wait a minute.
Is that one of the sweat hogs

06:39.300 --> 06:40.400
<i>from Welcome Back, Kotter?</i>

06:40.400 --> 06:41.700
He is a Buy More employee.

06:41.700 --> 06:43.400
You know, he doesn't work
at this store.

06:43.400 --> 06:45.300
But you should check out
one of our other

06:45.300 --> 06:48.000
13 convenient
Southern California locations.

06:50.700 --> 06:51.600
Hmm...

07:55.300 --> 07:56.700
Farrokh Bulsara,

07:56.700 --> 07:58.900
CLASSIFIED
born in the Asir Province, 1974.

07:58.900 --> 08:00.800
The past ten years,
he's been hopping

08:00.800 --> 08:03.100
between training camps
from Syria to Somalia.

08:03.100 --> 08:05.300
What does a global terrorist
want with a nerd like Jeff?

08:05.300 --> 08:06.700
Insightful question,
Bartowski.

08:06.700 --> 08:08.200
It's why we have
an Intersect.

08:08.200 --> 08:10.500
We want you to approach
Jeff socially.

08:10.600 --> 08:11.800
Get to know him
better and see

08:11.800 --> 08:12.900
if you can get
him to open up

08:12.900 --> 08:14.000
about his past.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.500
You want me to hang out
with Jeff?

08:16.500 --> 08:18.100
It's either that, or we throw
him in the back of a van

08:18.100 --> 08:20.500
and have an agency interrogation
team go to work on him.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.400
Great, so it comes down
to either torturing him

08:22.400 --> 08:23.600
or torturing me?

08:24.100 --> 08:25.400
Looks like we got a bogey.

08:28.100 --> 08:29.000
Sarah?

08:29.100 --> 08:30.200
Is that my sister?

08:30.400 --> 08:32.000
Ellie, what a surprise.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.700
Yeah, I was just driving around

08:33.700 --> 08:35.299
I thought it'd
be nice, uh...

08:36.200 --> 08:38.100
I thought it would be nice
if you and I could talk

08:38.100 --> 08:39.700
without Chuck, actually.

08:40.500 --> 08:41.700
Oh, okay.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.700
Not polite
to spy, Chuck.

08:48.600 --> 08:50.500
I would hate it if he found out
that I was going

08:50.500 --> 08:51.600
behind his back
like this.

08:51.600 --> 08:53.700
Oh, well, your secret
is safe with me.

08:54.700 --> 08:57.100
Do you know if he has any plans?

08:57.100 --> 08:58.000
Tonight?

08:58.300 --> 09:01.700
Uh, actually, I think he is
hanging out with Jeff.

09:03.800 --> 09:07.800
Nerd Herd, creepy, serial-killer
Jeff?

09:08.100 --> 09:08.400
Yeah.

09:08.400 --> 09:10.300
I think it's time
that you and I had a talk.

09:30.200 --> 09:31.900
I hope you enjoyed
your fro-yo?

09:31.900 --> 09:35.700
Ha. Yeah, I was,
uh, just seeing my girlfriend.

09:35.900 --> 09:37.300
Girlfriend? Oh...

09:37.800 --> 09:40.300
I, too, have
a special lady friend.

09:41.200 --> 09:42.400
Henrietta.

09:42.400 --> 09:44.500
She works in our Ontario branch,
accounts payable.

09:45.100 --> 09:46.600
She's a real tigress.

09:48.500 --> 09:50.700
Well, now that
we've gotten the topic

09:50.700 --> 09:51.700
of our love life out of the way,

09:51.700 --> 09:53.300
perhaps you'd like to sit
down for our interview.

09:54.100 --> 09:54.900
How is tomorrow?

09:54.900 --> 09:56.900
'Cause I'm really more
of a morning person.

09:59.300 --> 10:00.500
I'll be the judge of that.

10:02.200 --> 10:04.200
Hey, buddy.
Where are you going?

10:04.600 --> 10:05.500
What'd I do?

10:06.100 --> 10:07.900
Nothing! No.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
You know... nothing.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.100
Just... you know, we never
really get the chance to talk.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.200
How about we grab a beer?

10:16.500 --> 10:17.400
No, thanks.

10:19.200 --> 10:21.600
I could be enticed
to grab a dozen beers, however.

10:23.300 --> 10:24.100
It's a date.

10:24.100 --> 10:25.700
We can kick it at my place.

10:25.800 --> 10:27.100
You're going
to love Roscoe.

10:27.100 --> 10:28.300
He's my ferret.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.700
Ooh... you know what?

10:30.700 --> 10:32.100
I'm actually allergic

10:32.100 --> 10:35.000
to any and every member
of the polecat family.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.100
So maybe we can kick it here?

10:37.900 --> 10:38.700
Sure.

10:40.500 --> 10:42.800
- Hmm.
- Hmm...

10:46.300 --> 10:48.400
Following a thorough inspection
of the branch,

10:48.400 --> 10:51.100
there seems to be no sign

10:51.100 --> 10:53.300
of intelligent life.

10:57.100 --> 10:58.000
May I present

10:58.000 --> 11:00.600
tonight's feature entertainment.

11:16.700 --> 11:19.400
You made an Anna music video?

11:19.400 --> 11:20.500
You like?

11:21.200 --> 11:22.200
Wow.

11:22.800 --> 11:24.400
It's really-

11:26.400 --> 11:27.100
Wow.

11:27.100 --> 11:28.300
I know, man.

11:28.700 --> 11:30.200
She's my muse.

11:30.900 --> 11:32.300
Now, if you'll excuse me.

11:32.800 --> 11:35.300
I'm going to slip
into my drinking pants.

11:35.300 --> 11:36.100
Look at that!

11:41.300 --> 11:43.100
Abort mission.
Extraction required.

11:43.100 --> 11:44.700
The Intersect
has been compromised.

11:44.800 --> 11:46.500
Negative.
Perimeter is secure.

11:46.500 --> 11:49.300
<i>I'm talking about the weirdo
inside the Buy More!</i>

11:49.400 --> 11:50.200
<i>I'm starting to think</i>

11:50.200 --> 11:52.300
that there's something
going on with my brother.

11:52.400 --> 11:53.100
Oh.

11:53.800 --> 11:54.300
Why?

11:54.300 --> 11:55.300
What do you mean?

11:56.800 --> 11:58.500
It's just
everything seemed

11:58.500 --> 12:00.300
to be moving along
just fine for Chuck.

12:00.300 --> 12:01.500
And you had everything
to do with that.

12:01.500 --> 12:02.600
Oh, thanks,

12:02.600 --> 12:04.600
but, uh, I-I can't
take the credit.

12:04.600 --> 12:07.400
Then, I don't know,
it's like...

12:07.700 --> 12:09.600
it's like he's slipping
back into old Chuck mode.

12:09.600 --> 12:10.700
You know, no
confidence.

12:10.700 --> 12:12.000
No direction.
It's-

12:12.000 --> 12:14.100
it's the Morgan
Years revisited.

12:14.100 --> 12:16.000
I mean he went to
Stanford, for God's sakes.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.700
Did you know that he's 12
credits short of graduating?

12:19.000 --> 12:21.400
12 credits short of a real life.

12:23.200 --> 12:24.800
I know that I sound
like his mother.

12:25.600 --> 12:26.400
Just tell me that I don't have

12:26.400 --> 12:29.100
anything to worry about
and I will lay off.

12:29.700 --> 12:31.900
Pound! Pound! Pound!

12:31.900 --> 12:33.600
Go! Yes!

12:33.600 --> 12:34.900
Pound! Pound!

12:34.900 --> 12:36.400
Quit being such
a lightweight!

12:36.400 --> 12:37.600
Resuming dictation.

12:37.600 --> 12:39.300
Yes! Yes!

12:39.300 --> 12:42.100
I'd like to report the following
violation of Buy More policy:

12:42.100 --> 12:42.800
misappropriation

12:42.800 --> 12:44.400
of the home theater room,

12:44.600 --> 12:45.200
after hours

12:45.200 --> 12:47.000
consumption of alcohol.

12:48.200 --> 12:50.400
And lewd use
of a musical montage.

12:52.400 --> 12:54.500
I'm going hohome at once
to file this report.

12:55.700 --> 12:57.000
Crazy thing happened today.

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
Uh, some dude came into the
store looking for you.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.700
He had this goofy,

13:01.700 --> 13:03.400
old picture and
everything.

13:03.500 --> 13:05.600
Only a matter of time, I guess.

13:06.500 --> 13:07.400
What?

13:08.600 --> 13:09.900
You mean you
know the guy?

13:09.900 --> 13:11.200
I'd imagine...

13:12.100 --> 13:13.600
he's one of my fans.

13:20.200 --> 13:22.700
You want to see something
I've never shared with anyone?

13:24.100 --> 13:25.100
Please don't be a porno.

13:25.100 --> 13:27.400
- Please, please don't be a porno.
- And I'd like you all

13:27.400 --> 13:29.200
to meet Jeffery Barnes.

13:29.200 --> 13:32.700
The new Missile Command
world champ.

13:33.300 --> 13:34.400
Missile Command?

13:34.500 --> 13:36.200
I used to kick ass at that game.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.200
Well, I was the best.

13:39.200 --> 13:41.000
By breaking the all-time record,

13:41.300 --> 13:44.300
you've won $100 in quarters

13:44.400 --> 13:46.900
and a year's supply
of Slim Jim's.

13:47.100 --> 13:49.300
This prize will be presented

13:49.300 --> 13:52.500
by none other
than Mr. Morimoto, CEO

13:52.500 --> 13:55.100
and chief engineer
at Atari games.

13:58.300 --> 14:01.600
Dude, you are
so wasted.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.400
FACIAL SCANNING

14:14.400 --> 14:14.700
COMPLETE
FARROKH BULSARA

14:14.700 --> 14:15.100
What is it

14:15.100 --> 14:17.100
about bad guys and vans?

14:21.900 --> 14:22.700
Okay.

14:23.500 --> 14:24.700
Okay, Chuck,
party's over.

14:24.800 --> 14:25.200
Hey, hey,

14:25.200 --> 14:27.400
I- I flashed! Some guy
on the TV. He's a video...

14:27.400 --> 14:29.100
Later, Chuck. We have guests.
Out the back door. Now!

14:29.100 --> 14:30.900
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, what about Jeff?
- What about him?

14:30.900 --> 14:33.000
- We can't just leave him here.
- He's deadweight.

14:34.700 --> 14:35.700
You weren't kidding.

14:36.100 --> 14:37.200
Go! Go!

14:41.700 --> 14:42.900
He pukes on my
upholstery,

14:42.900 --> 14:44.700
he's gonna wish we left him
with the terrorists.

14:49.900 --> 14:50.900
Search the place.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.500
<i>Should I be worried about him?</i>

14:52.500 --> 14:55.900
You know, um, Chuck is, uh...

14:56.200 --> 14:57.700
Chuck is like a duck.

14:58.400 --> 14:58.900
Sometimes

14:58.900 --> 15:02.000
it seems like
he is just gliding along,

15:02.000 --> 15:03.200
but beneath the surface,

15:03.200 --> 15:05.300
his, uh... his little feet
are-are just

15:05.300 --> 15:07.200
paddling away like crazy.

15:07.800 --> 15:08.700
Deep down,

15:08.700 --> 15:11.200
I really think
Chuck is an incredibly mature

15:11.200 --> 15:13.300
and responsible guy.

15:15.900 --> 15:16.700
Chuck?

15:18.200 --> 15:18.700
Oh!

15:18.700 --> 15:19.500
- Oh,
- is he okay?

15:19.500 --> 15:21.900
Yeah. Don't worry.
This guy's feeling no pain.

15:22.700 --> 15:23.300
Ouch.

15:23.300 --> 15:25.000
Here we go. Here we go.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.200
Big boy. Big boy.

15:32.200 --> 15:34.100
What's up, ladies?

15:36.500 --> 15:37.800
You take the brunette.

15:38.600 --> 15:40.800
I'm gonna take a crack
at the blonde.

15:46.600 --> 15:47.900
???

15:52.200 --> 15:53.900
Oh...! Jeff!

15:54.100 --> 15:56.500
I'm, uh, supposed
to give this to you.

15:59.200 --> 16:01.300
MY NAME IS JEFF AND I'M LOST

16:01.900 --> 16:02.600
Okay.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.200
Is that your address?

16:04.600 --> 16:06.100
- Yeah.
- All right, we're gonna get you a cab.

16:06.100 --> 16:07.800
Already have.
Already here. Thank you.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.100
Great. Awesome.
Come on, Jeff.

16:09.100 --> 16:10.700
That was a great
time last night, huh?

16:10.700 --> 16:12.300
You got smashed
and passed out,

16:12.700 --> 16:14.800
and we just watched, and
it was really awkward.

16:14.900 --> 16:16.100
Okay, here
you go, buddy.

16:16.400 --> 16:17.300
Get home safe.

16:19.700 --> 16:20.300
Chuck.

16:20.300 --> 16:22.100
We're about to have one of
those conversations, aren't we?

16:22.100 --> 16:23.500
Well, if I wasn't
worried enough,

16:23.500 --> 16:25.200
last night's
performance was...

16:25.200 --> 16:27.000
Not... Not one of
my proudest moments.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
Uh-uh.

16:28.300 --> 16:30.500
I feel like you left
all those back at Stanford.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.500
I'm sorry. I just...

16:34.000 --> 16:35.700
You were so close to graduating.

16:35.700 --> 16:37.400
You know, maybe if you just
went back and finished,

16:37.400 --> 16:39.900
you could move on
to the next phase.

16:40.300 --> 16:41.700
I mean, if the world
were gonna end today,

16:41.700 --> 16:43.000
- why would you want to...?
- I- I hear you.

16:43.400 --> 16:44.300
I really do.

16:44.600 --> 16:46.100
But all those goals
I used to have-

16:46.700 --> 16:47.900
I still have 'em.

16:49.700 --> 16:50.600
Okay.

16:51.700 --> 16:52.700
Hey, sis?

16:53.800 --> 16:55.100
The world's not gonna end today.

16:58.100 --> 17:00.000
I have very reliable sources.

17:09.400 --> 17:10.599
Wild night,
huh, buddy?

17:10.599 --> 17:12.800
Nah. Pretty
standard Tuesday.

17:13.300 --> 17:15.400
This is bad.
This is very bad.

17:15.599 --> 17:17.200
Can't you see
that we're losing them, man?

17:17.500 --> 17:18.700
I'm your best friend, Jeff.

17:18.700 --> 17:19.900
No, I'm your best
friend, Chuck!

17:19.900 --> 17:21.300
Oh, isn't life grand!

17:23.300 --> 17:24.500
Maybe we should form
an alliance.

17:25.400 --> 17:26.500
You and me could be
best friends?

17:26.500 --> 17:28.300
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, dude.

17:28.700 --> 17:29.800
Let's not, uh...

17:30.400 --> 17:31.900
Let's not panic
here, okay?

17:32.100 --> 17:33.000
Thanks, man.

17:33.000 --> 17:33.900
Well, you know...

17:34.100 --> 17:34.800
It was very
comfortable.

17:34.800 --> 17:35.900
Sure.

17:36.600 --> 17:37.600
Excuse me.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.200
We need to talk.

17:40.500 --> 17:42.100
My sister thinks
I'm an idiot, I know.

17:42.800 --> 17:44.100
Actually, we just got
some fresh intel

17:44.100 --> 17:46.300
on your favorite
video game designer.

17:48.200 --> 17:50.700
There were a few things
Morimoto left out of his bio.

17:50.700 --> 17:53.200
Yeah. Guy secretly worked
for Japanese military.

17:53.400 --> 17:54.900
In 1980, they
launched Morimoto's

17:54.900 --> 17:56.700
first-generation
weapons satellite.

17:57.200 --> 17:58.600
The guy who created
Missile Command

17:58.600 --> 18:00.100
commands
actual missiles?

18:00.600 --> 18:01.200
Via satellite.

18:01.200 --> 18:02.100
It's still up there-

18:02.100 --> 18:03.900
dormant,
but presumed operational.

18:03.900 --> 18:04.300
Anyone knows how

18:04.300 --> 18:06.200
to fire that puppy up,
it's Morimoto.

18:06.400 --> 18:08.700
And you think he's working
with Farrokh and the terrorists?

18:08.700 --> 18:10.200
Well, he hasn't been seen
in years.

18:10.500 --> 18:12.400
We captured this image
outside Morimoto's office

18:12.400 --> 18:13.700
about an hour ago.

18:17.400 --> 18:18.400
What about Jeff?

18:18.600 --> 18:20.000
How is he supposed
to be involved in all this?

18:20.000 --> 18:21.100
The only way
to find out is

18:21.100 --> 18:23.200
to get into
Atari headquarters.

18:23.200 --> 18:24.200
Security's going to be tight.

18:24.200 --> 18:25.500
But if we don't
secure the satellite,

18:25.500 --> 18:28.300
then Jeff's safety is gonna be
the least of our concerns.

18:29.400 --> 18:30.700
So how do you want to do this?

18:31.800 --> 18:32.600
Guys...

18:34.500 --> 18:35.400
I have an idea.

18:36.800 --> 18:37.900
All right, be
cool, Casey.

18:38.300 --> 18:39.400
Have you seen
what I'm wearing?

18:39.400 --> 18:40.700
Just let me do
the talking, okay?

18:40.700 --> 18:42.900
These are my people-
programmers, nerds.

18:42.900 --> 18:44.400
And right now, their
network is being attacked

18:44.400 --> 18:46.300
by a particularly
nasty virus.

18:46.500 --> 18:49.000
Back at Stanford, we called
it the Bartowski special.

18:49.100 --> 18:50.600
Yeah, real cool
there, Chuck.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.800
Damn computers are out
all over the building.

18:56.800 --> 18:58.100
Gentlemen,
excuse me.

18:58.700 --> 18:59.400
What do you want?

18:59.400 --> 19:00.900
We heard you're having
a computer problem.

19:00.900 --> 19:02.300
Someone
called. Bill?

19:02.300 --> 19:03.300
Bob... I can't
remember,

19:03.300 --> 19:05.000
exactly; it was a
very common name.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.700
- Yeah, we got it covered.
- Mind if I take a peek?

19:06.700 --> 19:07.600
Look, nerd,

19:07.600 --> 19:09.000
Atari has
more Ph. D.s

19:09.000 --> 19:10.600
than friggin'
Microsoft.

19:10.600 --> 19:11.100
Yeah. Why don't you help

19:11.100 --> 19:13.300
some old lady log onto AOL?

19:14.300 --> 19:16.300
Nice one. Ooh!

19:20.400 --> 19:21.400
Plan B.

19:39.900 --> 19:41.100
Hi.

19:43.300 --> 19:45.500
I hear you're having
a computer problem.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.400
See, if I could just get
onto that terminal, I could

19:49.400 --> 19:51.400
set off the fire alarm,
I couldcrash the power,

19:51.400 --> 19:52.500
create a diversion.

19:54.800 --> 19:55.100
Or we could just

19:55.100 --> 19:56.300
take the stairs.

19:56.600 --> 19:57.200
Looks like
Agent Walker's

19:57.200 --> 19:58.800
got the diversion
pretty well covered.

20:11.700 --> 20:13.000
Sarah doesn't even know
how to fix a computer.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.100
The second she touches
that machine, our cover's blown.

20:15.100 --> 20:17.000
The CPUs have been
massively overvolted,

20:17.000 --> 20:19.400
but we may be able to ghost
the drive on another system.

20:20.000 --> 20:23.100
The more elegant solution
would be to flash the BIOS

20:23.100 --> 20:24.900
and swap out
the cooked CPU.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.800
What are you guys waiting for?

20:43.700 --> 20:44.800
Okay. I'm gonna
see if I can find

20:44.800 --> 20:46.100
another way into
the penthouse.

20:46.100 --> 20:47.500
You wait here
where it's safe.

20:51.700 --> 20:54.200
This place is creepy.

20:55.200 --> 20:57.300
So creepy.

21:02.400 --> 21:05.900
Well, if it isn't my friend
from the Buy More.

21:07.100 --> 21:08.000
What a funny coincidence

21:08.000 --> 21:09.200
finding you here.

21:09.600 --> 21:11.700
Yeah, it's
freakin' hilarious.

21:12.900 --> 21:14.400
What a small world, right?

21:14.600 --> 21:16.000
I got a... I got a
call about a computer

21:16.000 --> 21:17.600
that was acting
up here, and so...

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
In fact, is this
the right floor?

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
I don't even
know if it's...

21:20.000 --> 21:21.500
You have the correct floor.

21:21.700 --> 21:23.300
- This way. Please.
- You know if you're busy,

21:23.300 --> 21:24.500
I can come back
another time.

21:24.500 --> 21:27.900
Uh-uh. You're timing
was perfect.

21:31.500 --> 21:31.900
I hope

21:31.900 --> 21:33.900
the machine doesn't give you
too much trouble.

21:43.900 --> 21:45.800
* What you say
about his company *

21:45.900 --> 21:49.000
* Is what you say
about society *

21:49.000 --> 21:52.000
* Catch the mist,
catch the myth *

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
* Catch the mystery,
catch the drift *

21:56.900 --> 21:58.300
You should not be here.

21:59.200 --> 22:01.300
Um, uh...

22:01.500 --> 22:04.800
* The world is,
the world is... *

22:04.800 --> 22:06.100
Mr. Morimoto?

22:06.400 --> 22:07.700
You listening
to Rush?

22:07.700 --> 22:08.900
You are too late.

22:08.900 --> 22:10.000
He took the code.

22:10.300 --> 22:12.000
Who are they, terrorists?

22:12.400 --> 22:13.300
I knew I should've
never hidden

22:13.300 --> 22:14.700
the numbers inside
the machine.

22:15.900 --> 22:17.000
You hid the satellite code

22:17.000 --> 22:18.900
inside a game of
Missile Command?

22:18.900 --> 22:22.000
Every game, hidden
in the final board.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
The kill screen.

22:23.400 --> 22:25.400
A secret level
only I could achieve.

22:25.500 --> 22:27.100
The mathematics underlying
the final board

22:27.100 --> 22:28.700
are too advanced.

22:29.100 --> 22:30.700
It's like the music
of the universe.

22:32.800 --> 22:33.300
Hands up.

22:33.300 --> 22:34.800
I am sorry, I
cannot do that.

22:34.800 --> 22:36.500
- What's going on here, Chuck?
- Wait.

22:37.100 --> 22:38.700
Wait, if the bad guys
have the code,

22:39.000 --> 22:40.500
why are you still
playing the game?

22:40.600 --> 22:41.300
Uh-oh.

22:44.900 --> 22:46.100
We're running out of time!

22:47.500 --> 22:48.600
SAVE YOURSELVES!

22:48.600 --> 22:51.100
- Let's get out of here, Chuck.
- No, we can't just leave him here.

22:51.100 --> 22:52.700
- Not this time.
- No, no, no, wait!

22:52.700 --> 22:55.500
Go, go, go!
It's a... wait, wait!

23:01.500 --> 23:02.200
THE END

23:07.700 --> 23:08.800
General, we're
sorry to report

23:08.800 --> 23:10.200
that Farrokh and his
team have the code.

23:10.200 --> 23:11.800
That, and they murdered
Morimoto.

23:11.800 --> 23:13.900
That means that your duties
are no longer required

23:13.900 --> 23:15.000
on this operation.

23:15.000 --> 23:15.700
Casey,

23:15.700 --> 23:17.900
we're turning this matter
over to the 30th Space Wing

23:17.900 --> 23:18.900
at Vandenberg.

23:18.900 --> 23:20.900
Wait, you're launching an ICBM?

23:21.000 --> 23:22.700
You think you can shoot
down that satellite

23:22.700 --> 23:23.700
before it
shoots us?

23:23.700 --> 23:25.400
Morimoto's satellite
will be passing

23:25.400 --> 23:27.800
over California in four hours.

23:27.800 --> 23:29.000
Best case,
we shoot it down

23:29.000 --> 23:31.200
off the coast before its own
missiles are armed.

23:31.300 --> 23:32.500
The satellite
falls to Earth

23:32.500 --> 23:34.400
with acceptable
civilian casualties.

23:34.400 --> 23:36.000
Wait a second, acceptable what?

23:36.000 --> 23:37.800
I'd like to hear
the bad version.

23:38.900 --> 23:39.800
We miss.

23:40.000 --> 23:40.700
What happens then?

23:40.700 --> 23:42.200
Farrokh uses
Morimoto's satellite

23:42.200 --> 23:43.900
to start World War III.

23:43.900 --> 23:45.900
Hey, what about the...
what about the kill screen?

23:45.900 --> 23:47.700
- Excuse me? - Missile Command - Morimoto said

23:47.700 --> 23:49.400
that the code is hidden
in every arcade game.

23:49.400 --> 23:51.400
If we can get to the kill
screen, we can get the code,

23:51.500 --> 23:53.100
and then we can take control
of the satellite.

23:53.600 --> 23:54.700
We'll have our engineers
take a...

23:54.700 --> 23:56.700
No, look, the only way to get
the code is by beating the game,

23:56.700 --> 23:58.100
and the only person
who can beat the game...

23:58.100 --> 23:59.700
- Is
- burned to a crisp.

23:59.700 --> 24:01.900
- I was talking about Jeff.
- So was I.

24:01.900 --> 24:04.000
Casey, you coordinate
with the Air Force

24:04.000 --> 24:05.300
while Mr. Bartowski

24:05.300 --> 24:07.900
pursues his...
contingency plan.

24:07.900 --> 24:09.800
But I promise you,
one way or another,

24:09.800 --> 24:11.900
I am bringing
that satellite down.

24:17.300 --> 24:17.800
You want me
to come out

24:17.800 --> 24:19.300
of Missile Command
retirement?

24:20.100 --> 24:21.200
You're serious?

24:21.400 --> 24:22.100
Deadly.

24:23.700 --> 24:24.600
I don't know, man.

24:24.700 --> 24:26.200
Come on, what's
the problem?

24:28.300 --> 24:31.000
I guess I'm just cool
with resting on my laurels

24:31.000 --> 24:32.400
- and whatnot.
- But Jeff...

24:32.900 --> 24:34.300
you could be
the first guy

24:34.300 --> 24:36.200
to ever get to
the kill screen.

24:36.800 --> 24:39.200
Listen, it doesn't exist.

24:39.700 --> 24:41.400
The kill screen's just a myth.

24:41.400 --> 24:43.900
I promise you, it's real,
and you're the only one

24:43.900 --> 24:45.000
who can do it.

24:45.300 --> 24:47.200
I'm a little out
of shape, mentally.

24:47.200 --> 24:48.700
Jeff, it's just a
stupid video game!

24:48.700 --> 24:50.200
That's where
you're wrong, Chuck.

24:50.500 --> 24:51.700
It's more
than a game.

24:54.200 --> 24:58.200
Besides, what do you care
whether I play or not?

25:03.100 --> 25:05.800
I guess I was just really moved
by what you said last night.

25:07.500 --> 25:09.500
- Huh?
- Oh, you remember.

25:09.700 --> 25:10.800
Come on.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.800
How you were
sick and tired

25:13.800 --> 25:16.500
of busting your ass
at this stupid store.

25:17.300 --> 25:19.100
How you had this
incredible gift

25:19.500 --> 25:22.400
that you couldn't wait
for the world to see.

25:23.300 --> 25:25.800
Really? I said that?

25:26.100 --> 25:27.100
Sure you did, Jeff.

25:28.200 --> 25:29.000
About Missile Command?

25:29.000 --> 25:30.500
You were very compelling.

25:36.100 --> 25:38.000
Okay, I'll do it.

25:38.200 --> 25:39.100
- I'll play.
- Buddy...

25:39.100 --> 25:42.100
But first,
I'm gonna need provisions.

25:42.500 --> 25:44.500
I need two bottles
grape cough syrup,

25:44.800 --> 25:46.600
one pound M&Ms, no brown,

25:46.900 --> 25:49.900
and my lucky arcade game from
the Gas 'N Sip in Tarzana.

25:51.100 --> 25:51.900
Done.

25:52.800 --> 25:53.500
Really?

25:54.800 --> 25:59.000
I want Anna
wearing a hula skirt

25:59.300 --> 26:01.400
fanning me with a palm frond.

26:02.200 --> 26:04.600
- HUH?
- I sweat profusely when I play.

26:04.600 --> 26:05.800
And finally,

26:05.900 --> 26:07.400
I need a crowd.

26:07.900 --> 26:10.700
- I want you to get some of my old fans back.
- Come on.

26:10.700 --> 26:12.600
The people that were into that
game are in their 40s now.

26:12.600 --> 26:14.000
They have jobs, and wives,

26:14.000 --> 26:15.200
and kids and...

26:20.700 --> 26:24.400
Hey, hey, hey-
Morgan, buddy.

26:24.500 --> 26:25.700
Can you give me
a hand with this?

26:26.000 --> 26:27.500
Why don't you just
go ask your buddy, Jeff?

26:27.500 --> 26:28.700
He's in the break room.

26:28.700 --> 26:31.100
We're putting together
this like video game

26:31.100 --> 26:32.600
exhibition-thingy
this afternoon.

26:32.600 --> 26:33.500
Jeff's gonna make a run

26:33.500 --> 26:35.700
at the all-time
Missile Command high score.

26:35.700 --> 26:37.700
- Whoa.
- Hey, where are you going?

26:38.200 --> 26:39.700
Sounds like you two guys
got it all worked out.

26:39.900 --> 26:41.300
Morgan, I desperately
need your help, okay?

26:41.300 --> 26:43.700
If Jeff doesn't break
the Missile Command record...

26:43.700 --> 26:46.200
What, Chuck?
The world's gonna end?

26:47.500 --> 26:48.900
Look, all I know
is that I need your help.

26:48.900 --> 26:50.700
Okay, I can't do this
without you, buddy.

26:50.800 --> 26:51.300
I can't.

26:51.300 --> 26:52.800
Hey, hey, was Jeff...

26:53.600 --> 26:55.700
was Jeff the president
of his high school

26:55.700 --> 26:57.300
audio/video club?

26:58.900 --> 26:59.400
Doubt it.

26:59.400 --> 27:02.700
<i>Was Jeff a roadie
for Mamma Mia</i>

27:02.700 --> 27:04.300
for four
straight summers?

27:07.800 --> 27:10.100
Does Jeff own
his own smoke machine?

27:11.900 --> 27:14.000
- No, but I do. Okay.
- Huh?

27:14.000 --> 27:15.400
Jeff is a loser, dude.

27:15.400 --> 27:16.500
I'll see what I can do.

27:16.500 --> 27:17.400
You're the best, buddy.

27:18.800 --> 27:20.600
Oh, and I'm gonna need
to borrow your girlfriend.

27:20.600 --> 27:22.300
- Oh, dude, she's all yours.
- Great.

27:25.400 --> 27:26.100
JEFF BARNES TO PLAY EXHIBITION!

27:26.100 --> 27:27.300
MISSILE COMMAND

27:40.100 --> 27:41.200
JEFF BARNES TO PLAY EXHIBITION!
MISSILE COMMAND

27:59.400 --> 28:01.900
THE GREAT ONE RETURNS
JEFF BARNES AT BUY MORE ASAP!

28:06.300 --> 28:08.400
Jeff! Jeff! Jeff! Jeff!

28:08.400 --> 28:11.900
Jeff! Jeff!
Jeff! Jeff!

28:14.400 --> 28:16.600
I'm here at a Burbank
electronics store

28:16.600 --> 28:18.500
where a local man
prepares to break

28:18.500 --> 28:20.600
the Missile Command record.
BLAST FROM THE PAST
A FADING STAR SEEKS NEW GLORY

28:20.600 --> 28:21.200
Now for those of you

28:21.200 --> 28:23.700
who weren't around
a quarter century ago,

28:23.700 --> 28:25.400
Jeffrey Barnes
first made his mark on...

28:29.600 --> 28:32.600
...way back in 1983.

28:36.400 --> 28:38.100
Sarah, Sarah-
I know where Farrokh is.

28:38.100 --> 28:39.800
The terrorists are using
a television station

28:39.800 --> 28:41.800
to control the satellite;
they're here in L.A.

28:44.100 --> 28:44.900
<i>Chuck flashed.</i>

28:45.000 --> 28:46.800
<i>He knows where they're
controlling the satellite.</i>

28:47.500 --> 28:48.200
There is still time

28:48.200 --> 28:49.900
before the satellite
is in range.

28:50.000 --> 28:51.500
Maybe Chuck's right,
but there's nothing you can do

28:51.500 --> 28:52.500
to stop it without the code.

28:52.500 --> 28:54.200
Well, I'm going to go
to the news station.

28:54.200 --> 28:56.000
Knock yourself out.
I have my orders.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.200
33 minutes and five
seconds, this finger

28:58.500 --> 28:59.600
gonna push
that button.

28:59.600 --> 29:01.300
Hmm. I'll call you
from the road.

29:01.300 --> 29:02.400
- Agent Walker.
- Yes.

29:02.400 --> 29:04.100
Who do you trust to bring down
a rogue satellite more:

29:04.100 --> 29:06.000
some burnout loser
playing a video game

29:06.800 --> 29:08.000
or an Air Force ICBM?

29:08.100 --> 29:09.500
I trust Chuck.

29:11.500 --> 29:16.800
Jeff! Jeff! Jeff! Jeff! Jeff!

29:16.800 --> 29:17.600
I'd like you all to meet

29:17.600 --> 29:19.900
Jeffrey Barnes.

29:23.200 --> 29:24.000
Uh...

29:24.000 --> 29:25.400
Missile Command

29:25.400 --> 29:27.100
world champ.

29:27.100 --> 29:28.600
I don't feel so hot.

29:29.100 --> 29:29.900
What? No, no, no.

29:29.900 --> 29:31.200
You're gonna be great.
You look great.

29:31.200 --> 29:32.300
You're gonna
kill it, buddy.

29:32.300 --> 29:33.800
What was I thinking, man?

29:33.900 --> 29:35.300
No one can get
the kill screen.

29:35.600 --> 29:36.900
I can't handle the math.

29:36.900 --> 29:38.000
You've dedicated three years

29:38.000 --> 29:40.600
of your life to playing
Missile Command.

29:41.000 --> 29:42.000
It's too heavy.

29:43.300 --> 29:44.800
It feels like my brain
is about to...

29:44.800 --> 29:46.400
What's next for Jeff Barnes,

29:46.400 --> 29:48.500
Missile Command world champ?

30:00.800 --> 30:01.800
Get up for
a second.

30:02.200 --> 30:03.000
Hey.

30:03.200 --> 30:04.100
I'll get some water.

30:04.900 --> 30:07.100
Hey, we-we-we need
to take care of this.

30:07.600 --> 30:09.100
Yeah.
Here I come.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.100
Hey, hey.

30:13.100 --> 30:14.100
Come on, buddy,
come on!

30:14.100 --> 30:15.800
Wake up, buddy!
You got to play!

30:15.800 --> 30:17.800
You got to get the kill screen,
you got to get the code.

30:17.800 --> 30:19.200
If we don't stop that
satellite, they're gonna launch

30:19.200 --> 30:21.000
some crazy missile into
space and then-then...

30:21.000 --> 30:24.200
then it's World War III.

30:25.300 --> 30:27.100
Acceptable civilian casualties.

30:28.500 --> 30:29.300
Oh, my God.

30:34.900 --> 30:35.800
Hey, Chuck, what's up?

30:35.800 --> 30:36.800
Hey, I was thinking,

30:36.800 --> 30:38.100
why don't you guys
get out of town, maybe

30:38.100 --> 30:40.200
Palm Springs, you and Awesome
just get out of town.

30:40.400 --> 30:41.900
Now, actually,
would be a great time.

30:42.000 --> 30:42.900
Trip's on me, you know.

30:42.900 --> 30:44.200
- Early wedding present.
- Wait a minute.

30:44.200 --> 30:45.700
Are you trying to get rid of me?

30:45.700 --> 30:46.900
No, no, I just
thought it'd be nice.

30:46.900 --> 30:48.200
What's gotten into you?

30:48.600 --> 30:50.300
I don't know.

30:51.700 --> 30:52.400
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

30:52.400 --> 30:54.500
I- I know I've been a bit
of a disappointment lately.

30:54.500 --> 30:55.800
I- I-I want you
to be proud of me.

30:55.800 --> 30:58.200
I just... I ran out of time,
that's all.

30:58.200 --> 30:59.700
Why don't we talk about this
when you get home?

30:59.700 --> 31:00.600
I got to run.

31:01.400 --> 31:02.400
I love you, Ellie.

31:08.700 --> 31:09.400
Honey,

31:09.700 --> 31:11.200
do you think my brother's
on drugs?

31:12.300 --> 31:13.200
That'd explain a lot.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.100
They're going nuts
out there, okay?

31:18.100 --> 31:20.100
These nerds are gonna
tear this joint apart.

31:20.600 --> 31:21.500
You got to do
something.

31:22.100 --> 31:23.300
What am I supposed to do?

31:23.400 --> 31:25.500
Well, they came to see
video game greatness.

31:26.500 --> 31:27.500
Someone better deliver.

31:33.300 --> 31:35.100
Ladies and gentlemen...

31:35.300 --> 31:37.500
or Gentlemen,

31:37.500 --> 31:39.800
let me introduce you
to the challenger.

31:39.800 --> 31:43.200
Hailing from the City of Angels,
the Master of Disaster...

31:43.200 --> 31:44.100
What's going on?

31:44.100 --> 31:45.800
...the King of Sting,

31:45.900 --> 31:47.300
the Dancing Destroyer,

31:47.500 --> 31:49.200
Charles Irving

31:49.400 --> 31:53.200
Bartowski!

31:53.200 --> 31:53.700
Who is this guy?

31:53.700 --> 31:55.100
Where's
Jeff Barnes?

32:39.900 --> 32:41.000
Who authorized this?

32:42.000 --> 32:43.300
This is an abomination.

32:49.000 --> 32:50.800
THE END

32:55.200 --> 32:57.100
You suck, Bartowski.

33:04.100 --> 33:05.300
<i>Are you listening to Rush?</i>

33:05.700 --> 33:07.000
<i>Music of the universe.</i>

33:11.300 --> 33:12.400
Missile Command.

33:12.800 --> 33:14.900
The mathematical pattern
underlying the game

33:14.900 --> 33:17.500
is exactly the same as-

33:18.400 --> 33:18.900
Morgan.

33:20.700 --> 33:21.800
Hey, uh, buddy,

33:21.800 --> 33:24.000
do, do we carry any Rush CDs
in the store?

33:24.100 --> 33:25.900
No need, I got 'em
all on my Zune.

33:26.500 --> 33:27.300
You have a Zune?

33:27.300 --> 33:29.100
Are you kidding me? No.
No, I'll grab my iPod.

33:29.100 --> 33:30.200
Good, good, good,
I have, I have

33:30.200 --> 33:32.100
a very,
very special request.

33:34.800 --> 33:35.900
On my mark.

33:36.300 --> 33:39.500

34:03.000 --> 34:05.600
* Though his mind is not
for rent *

34:05.600 --> 34:08.600
* Don't put him down
as arrogant *

34:08.600 --> 34:11.300
* His reserve, a quiet defense *

34:11.300 --> 34:14.500
* Riding out the day's events *

34:14.500 --> 34:16.500
* The river... *

Command, Major Casey.

34:32.199 --> 34:34.600
* What you say
about his company *

34:34.600 --> 34:37.699

about society *

34:37.699 --> 34:40.400
* Catch the mist,
catch the myth *

34:40.400 --> 34:43.100
* Catch the mystery,
catch the drift... *

34:44.600 --> 34:45.900
Engaging telemetry.

34:48.199 --> 34:49.300
Arming warhead.

34:51.699 --> 34:53.699
And opening silo door.

35:12.800 --> 35:15.400
* No, his mind is not for rent *

35:15.400 --> 35:18.200
* To any God or government *

35:18.200 --> 35:21.000
* Always hopeful,
yet discontent *

35:21.000 --> 35:23.800
* He knows changes
aren't permanent... *

35:23.800 --> 35:25.000
Give me the code.

35:26.100 --> 35:26.900
It was destroyed.

35:26.900 --> 35:28.400
I'm gonna do this.

35:28.500 --> 35:30.200
No one can stop
the satellite now!

35:30.200 --> 35:31.100
Tell me what
the target is.

35:31.100 --> 35:32.900
- What's the satellite aimed at?
- Why?

35:33.100 --> 35:33.900
It doesn't matter.

35:33.900 --> 35:36.800
No one will remember
who threw the first stone.

35:43.300 --> 35:44.800
- Oh, my God.
- Gentlemen,

35:44.800 --> 35:46.300
we have a kill screen.

35:46.300 --> 35:47.200
I got this.

35:49.100 --> 35:49.800
Target's to range.

35:49.800 --> 35:51.700
Releasing synchronized safeties.

35:52.400 --> 35:53.800
On my mark.

35:55.900 --> 35:56.700

WOULD YOU LIKE TO PLAY AGAIN?
YES              NO

36:08.100 --> 36:08.600
NO

36:08.600 --> 36:09.700
OZPGSB

36:14.800 --> 36:16.000
Fire when ready, sir.

36:19.900 --> 36:20.900
Chuck, what's happening?

36:20.900 --> 36:21.900
Sarah, I did it!

36:22.400 --> 36:23.500
I did it, I beat the game.

36:23.500 --> 36:24.400
I got to the kill screen.

36:24.400 --> 36:25.500
I got the code!

36:25.600 --> 36:27.000
The game- it follows a pattern.

36:27.800 --> 36:29.300
It's just like
Mr. Morimoto said-

36:29.800 --> 36:31.100
the music of the universe.

36:31.100 --> 36:32.400
Chuck, just give me the code.

36:32.800 --> 36:34.000

WEAPONS SEQUENCE TERMINATED

36:48.200 --> 36:49.300
Oh, my God.

Satellite's powering down.

36:53.400 --> 36:54.700
Terminate launch sequence.

36:55.300 --> 36:55.900
This bogey's
bugging out

36:55.900 --> 36:57.000
and going home.

36:57.600 --> 36:58.400
Damn.

37:01.100 --> 37:01.900
You did it, Chuck.

37:01.900 --> 37:02.800
It worked!

37:03.600 --> 37:04.500
How does it feel to be a hero,

37:04.500 --> 37:06.000
Mr. Bartowski?

37:20.000 --> 37:21.100
Oh. Oh.

37:31.900 --> 37:34.500
<i>Looks like you fools had
one hell of a party.</i>

37:37.200 --> 37:38.600
Congratulations,
Bartowski.

37:39.500 --> 37:40.500
That's quite
an achievement.

37:42.500 --> 37:44.100
And in light
of today's events,

37:44.400 --> 37:45.000
I'd like to announce

37:45.000 --> 37:47.400
there's a new assistant
manager amongst us.

37:47.400 --> 37:48.000
What'd I tell you, man?

37:48.000 --> 37:49.300
It's all coming up
Bartowski.

37:49.300 --> 37:52.000
You all remember
Mr. Emmett Milbarge.

37:52.500 --> 37:54.800
Mr. Milbarge has
volunteered to stay on

37:55.000 --> 37:55.700
for...

37:56.100 --> 37:58.000
well, as long as it takes.

37:59.400 --> 38:00.500
That's right, Michael.

38:00.800 --> 38:02.500
I'm afraid this
branch is sick.

38:02.800 --> 38:05.300
And not the kind of sick that
can be fixed with a Band-Aid.

38:05.800 --> 38:08.100
What this Buy More needs
requires a surgeon.

38:09.200 --> 38:10.100
Someone who doesn't mind

38:10.100 --> 38:11.900
getting up to their
elbows in guts.

38:12.100 --> 38:13.200
Mmm.

38:13.700 --> 38:15.300
And that's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

38:16.900 --> 38:18.000
I'm gonna reach in,

38:18.600 --> 38:21.200
wrap my fingers
around the disease,

38:21.700 --> 38:24.300
and rip... it... out.

38:36.900 --> 38:37.900
How you feeling, buddy?

38:38.600 --> 38:40.700
- Better.
- Good.

38:40.800 --> 38:41.700
Thanks.

38:44.600 --> 38:45.500
So...

38:45.800 --> 38:47.700
Missile Command champion.

38:49.200 --> 38:50.300
I got lucky.

38:51.600 --> 38:52.500
You know.

38:54.300 --> 38:55.400
Congrats.

38:57.700 --> 38:58.700
I'm glad it was you.

39:02.800 --> 39:03.600
I mean, you're sure
you're not...

39:03.600 --> 39:05.200
Me? Uh-uh.

39:05.200 --> 39:06.200
I'm cool.

39:06.800 --> 39:08.800
Being number one
is a real bitch.

39:09.500 --> 39:12.500
Feels like the whole world is
gunning for you, sometimes.

39:14.600 --> 39:15.600
I can imagine.

39:20.400 --> 39:22.700
So, what was it like?

39:22.700 --> 39:24.700
The kill screen?

39:27.200 --> 39:28.100
Forget it.

39:30.200 --> 39:31.100
I'll see you tomorrow.

39:42.300 --> 39:42.900
Oh,

39:42.900 --> 39:45.100
I am so proud of you!

39:45.100 --> 39:46.300
Hey, relax.

39:46.300 --> 39:47.400
It's just a video game.

39:47.400 --> 39:49.800
Granted, I am the best Missile
Commander in the world.

39:49.800 --> 39:51.800
I'm not talking
about a stupid video game.

39:51.800 --> 39:53.100
I'm talking about this.

39:53.200 --> 39:54.800
Sarah told us
what's inside.

40:00.200 --> 40:01.200
My diploma?

40:02.300 --> 40:04.400
Well, don't act
so surprised.

40:04.400 --> 40:06.200
You sly dog.

40:06.300 --> 40:07.500
Sarah also told us about

40:07.500 --> 40:09.300
what you've been doing
behind our backs.

40:10.500 --> 40:11.400
She did?

40:11.700 --> 40:12.200
Really?

40:12.200 --> 40:13.900
Yeah. No wonder you've
been such a mess

40:13.900 --> 40:15.400
- this past year.
- Why didn't you

40:15.400 --> 40:17.300
tell us that you were
taking online courses?

40:19.100 --> 40:20.000
Oh!

40:20.100 --> 40:22.900
Oh, right... that.

40:23.000 --> 40:24.700
You two kids have some
celebrating to do.

40:25.000 --> 40:26.000
She's waiting
out back.

40:26.200 --> 40:28.100
You'll thank me for that ginseng
shake in the morning.

40:28.300 --> 40:30.000
You really surprised me,
Charles.

40:38.300 --> 40:40.900
Well, thanks for
my fake diploma.

40:40.900 --> 40:43.000
- What do you mean?
- I get it.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.600
You know, you had one
of your CIA pal's

40:44.600 --> 40:46.500
doctor it up to get
Ellie off my back.

40:46.600 --> 40:47.700
It's real, Chuck.

40:49.000 --> 40:49.500
Come on.

40:49.500 --> 40:51.000
I'm serious.
You graduated.

40:51.000 --> 40:52.400
What about my last
12 credits?

40:52.600 --> 40:53.500
Well, Casey and I decided

40:53.500 --> 40:55.500
that your exceptional
field service

40:55.500 --> 40:56.800
ought to count
for something

40:56.800 --> 40:58.500
and Stanford agreed.

40:59.500 --> 41:00.200
Huh.

41:00.500 --> 41:03.200
And by exceptional,
you mean, like, uh,

41:03.900 --> 41:06.200
I don't know, decrypting
weapons-satellite codes?

41:06.200 --> 41:07.300
Electrical Engineering.

41:07.300 --> 41:08.800
Or running away from
exploding games

41:08.800 --> 41:10.000
of Missile Command?

41:10.000 --> 41:11.400
Physical Education.

41:12.300 --> 41:13.600
You earned it, Chuck.

41:22.200 --> 41:23.000
Thank you.

41:26.500 --> 41:28.400
You see that star out there
on the horizon?

41:31.900 --> 41:32.600
That's the Air Force

41:32.600 --> 41:35.000
bouncing Morimoto's satellite
off the atmosphere

41:35.000 --> 41:36.100
and burning it up.

41:37.600 --> 41:38.600
Make a wish.

41:39.000 --> 41:40.100
It's yours.

42:11.700 --> 42:12.700
Hey, bud.

42:13.400 --> 42:14.400
