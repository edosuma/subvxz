00:01.737 --> 00:03.343
<i>(announcer) Previously on "Hunters"...</i>

00:03.404 --> 00:04.596
(man) Hunter number seven,

00:04.596 --> 00:06.011
aka Lionel McCarthy.

00:06.112 --> 00:07.580
What do you know about us?

00:07.681 --> 00:09.647
He took Abby. My wife.

00:09.749 --> 00:12.150
(man) We traced the heroin found
in McCarthy's warehouse

00:12.252 --> 00:14.385
to a Columbian drug cartel.

00:14.487 --> 00:16.556
The Hunters are
running drugs in the jungle

00:16.556 --> 00:18.317
and you're sending me
a new guy to find them.

00:18.358 --> 00:19.925
I've raided dozens of drug labs.

00:20.025 --> 00:21.425
I've never seen anything like this.

00:21.460 --> 00:22.894
Something else is going on.

00:22.995 --> 00:24.797
When do we tell them we're
fighting monsters

00:24.897 --> 00:25.998
and not a drug cartel?

00:26.099 --> 00:27.298
We don't tell them anything,

00:27.399 --> 00:28.800
and they're not monsters.

00:28.902 --> 00:31.336
- Did you always look so...
- Human?

00:31.437 --> 00:34.340
Thought I was, until my
parents told me I wasn't.

00:34.441 --> 00:35.374
This is what we are.

00:35.475 --> 00:36.341
(gunshot)

00:36.442 --> 00:37.609
What was that?

00:37.710 --> 00:39.098
He saw too much.

00:39.100 --> 00:41.112
Has E.T.U. ever caught one
that doesn't look like you?

00:41.213 --> 00:43.749
We've never captured
one alive in any form.

00:43.850 --> 00:46.218
(creature clicking)

00:46.319 --> 00:48.143
(camera shutter clicking)

00:49.834 --> 00:51.624
McCarthy must have warned

00:51.725 --> 00:53.826
the Hunters about the
Columbian operation.

00:53.926 --> 00:56.295
If he did, then he's
culpable for all these victims.

00:56.396 --> 00:58.564
Not to mention the bombing fatalities,

00:58.664 --> 01:01.299
or the junkie he
killed just to toy with Flynn.

01:01.401 --> 01:03.268
Jules, where are we with
the Spotify lead?

01:03.369 --> 01:04.503
Nothing yet.

01:04.602 --> 01:07.006
My team's combing through
tracks as fast as we can.

01:07.106 --> 01:08.173
I caught a break.

01:08.274 --> 01:11.543
Possible McCarthy lead, female.

01:11.644 --> 01:13.978
Good, work it.

01:14.079 --> 01:16.448
And follow up
McCarthy's musician persona,

01:16.549 --> 01:18.117
Cymatics Society.

01:18.218 --> 01:20.085
I'll loop in the other agents.

01:20.186 --> 01:22.120
Regan is prepping for a debriefing.

01:22.222 --> 01:24.623
Flynn has family matters to attend to.

01:24.724 --> 01:25.658
His wife?

01:25.759 --> 01:27.359
Unfortunately, there's no sign of her.

01:27.460 --> 01:29.894
Yet another reason we
need to find this target.

01:29.995 --> 01:33.132
We may not know his current whereabouts,
but we know this,

01:33.233 --> 01:36.468
Lionel McCarthy is out
there and he is on the hunt.

01:36.569 --> 01:37.902

05:11.783 --> 05:13.185
(Emme) Flynn!

05:13.286 --> 05:15.786
- Hey.
- You're seven minutes late.

05:15.889 --> 05:17.422
Six-and-a-half, but who's counting?

05:17.523 --> 05:19.750
Oh, yeah... you are.

05:19.752 --> 05:20.911
We'll, uh, just get some lunch

05:20.927 --> 05:22.927
and I'll have her back before 2:00.

05:23.028 --> 05:24.028
Back by 5:00?

05:24.997 --> 05:27.165
- Back by 5:00.
- Thank you.

05:28.367 --> 05:29.735
(Flynn) That's it?

05:29.836 --> 05:32.838
I haven't seen you in a week
and you're checking Facebook?

05:32.939 --> 05:35.374
It's "International Piano Magazine."

05:35.475 --> 05:38.911
Abby bought me a
subscription for my birthday last year.

05:39.012 --> 05:41.178
Okay, what are you reading about?

05:41.281 --> 05:42.848
About who won the Cliburn competition.

05:44.449 --> 05:45.951
Like you really care.

05:46.052 --> 05:48.019
I care about you.

05:48.120 --> 05:50.197
You're the one who
didn't even call for five days.

05:50.199 --> 05:51.519
Emme, it was work, I had to go...

05:51.524 --> 05:53.891
Look, don't they know Abby's missing?

05:55.295 --> 05:57.762
Isn't that more
important than some stupid job?

05:57.863 --> 05:58.896
(phone alert)

06:00.300 --> 06:02.567
I thought you were
reading a piano magazine.

06:02.668 --> 06:03.901
I am.

06:05.338 --> 06:06.404
Mm-hmm.

06:10.009 --> 06:12.110
It's cold and it's raining

06:12.211 --> 06:13.612
and I want to go back to school.

06:13.713 --> 06:16.247
What? Come on, we just got here.

06:16.348 --> 06:18.516
I don't understand why
you pretend to care about me.

06:18.617 --> 06:20.384
Of course I care about you.

06:21.553 --> 06:25.290
Then do as I ask and
take me back to school.

06:29.862 --> 06:31.529
(ducks quacking)

06:33.733 --> 06:36.067
(Finnerman) After the
Colombian contractor was contained,

06:36.168 --> 06:39.103
you and Agent Carroll continued
in pursuit alone,

06:39.204 --> 06:40.838
despite being ordered otherwise.

06:40.939 --> 06:43.040
The Hunter was wounded,

06:43.141 --> 06:44.576
and Agent Carroll and I agreed

06:44.677 --> 06:46.577
that it would be best if he and I...

06:46.678 --> 06:48.713
Keep your statements to your
own judgments and actions.

06:48.713 --> 06:51.783
This was our chance to
catch a native Hunter.

06:51.884 --> 06:54.086
I was our only chance.

06:54.187 --> 06:55.887
You'd rather I just let it go?

06:55.988 --> 06:58.622
What happened when you came
face to face with the Hunter?

07:00.360 --> 07:03.028
(creature clicking)

07:03.129 --> 07:05.831
He looked at me for a
few seconds and then ran off.

07:05.932 --> 07:07.565
(creature clicking)

07:08.968 --> 07:11.103
I chased it...

07:11.204 --> 07:14.406
but dropped my weapon, and it outran me.

07:18.110 --> 07:19.911
I'm having a hard time understanding

07:20.012 --> 07:22.213
why the Hunter left
you completely unharmed,

07:22.314 --> 07:23.548
especially after it killed

07:23.649 --> 07:27.351
27 people at the heroin plantation.

07:27.452 --> 07:29.387
It must have known what I was.

07:29.488 --> 07:31.990
Which still begs the question.

07:33.893 --> 07:36.194
(police sirens wail)

07:36.295 --> 07:37.375
I had to pull some strings,

07:37.430 --> 07:39.697
but I went back further
in Abby's phone records,

07:39.798 --> 07:40.865
like you asked me to.

07:40.966 --> 07:44.036
Nothing unusual in the
records the last six months.

07:44.137 --> 07:45.971
If you go back further...

07:46.072 --> 07:49.074
Kevin's phone number keeps popping up.

07:49.175 --> 07:49.975
A lot.

07:50.076 --> 07:53.478
(scoffs) He was my partner.

07:53.579 --> 07:55.613
She'd call him when she couldn't get me.

07:56.915 --> 07:58.350
Check out the day he was killed.

07:58.451 --> 07:59.817
Abby spoke to Kevin

07:59.918 --> 08:01.620
three times that morning,

08:01.721 --> 08:03.221
an hour before he got shot,

08:03.322 --> 08:05.824
then nothing.

08:05.925 --> 08:07.225
No way.

08:07.326 --> 08:08.886
Hey, I'm just showing you what I found.

08:08.894 --> 08:10.528
They were not having an affair,

08:10.629 --> 08:13.932
and Abby had nothing to
do with my partner's murder.

08:14.033 --> 08:15.733
Kevin was killed by a drug cartel.

08:15.834 --> 08:17.935
Maybe. I thought one of
the Columbian groups

08:18.036 --> 08:19.303
might've had a hand in it...

08:19.404 --> 08:21.473
Envigado, Olvidos, Los Rastrados...

08:21.574 --> 08:23.141
but it was a dead end.

08:23.242 --> 08:25.177
Olvidos.

08:25.278 --> 08:27.211
- What about it?
- A dead junkie turned up

08:27.312 --> 08:29.980
about a week ago with Olvidos
heroin in her system.

08:30.082 --> 08:31.415
And a hole in her back?

08:31.516 --> 08:33.076
There's been a string of those murders,

08:33.152 --> 08:36.620
gory, like some
homemade spinal tap voodoo shit.

08:36.721 --> 08:39.057
What's all that got to do with Abby?

08:42.128 --> 08:43.727
Bitch thinks I'm the mole.

08:43.830 --> 08:46.264
Since when have you cared
about what Finnerman thinks of you?

08:46.365 --> 08:47.966
- I don't.
- Good.

08:48.067 --> 08:49.134
Neither do I.

08:49.235 --> 08:50.534
(phone alert)

08:50.602 --> 08:52.911
_

08:54.106 --> 08:55.573
That thing still on?

08:57.243 --> 08:59.043
(beep)

09:01.614 --> 09:03.514
There's something I
didn't include in my report.

09:05.451 --> 09:08.086
When the Hunter saw me, it
communicated something,

09:08.187 --> 09:09.653
in its clicking language.

09:09.754 --> 09:12.356
- What did it say?
- It wasn't words.

09:12.457 --> 09:14.024
It was a shape and spaces,

09:14.126 --> 09:17.796
like what I heard when I listened
to the Slavic track.

09:17.897 --> 09:19.597
It looked something like this.

09:31.543 --> 09:33.745
You saw this when it spoke to you?

09:33.846 --> 09:35.246
More like I heard it.

09:35.347 --> 09:36.748
It's hard to explain.

09:36.849 --> 09:38.149
Hmm.

09:39.585 --> 09:41.919
We keep this to ourselves for now.

09:49.028 --> 09:52.730
(car approaching)

09:54.866 --> 09:56.668
(hip-hop music playing)

09:56.769 --> 09:59.336
(car door opens)

10:01.407 --> 10:04.775
I wanted to run
something by you, unofficially,

10:04.876 --> 10:06.544
before taking it to Jackson.

10:06.645 --> 10:09.581
There's been a
string of murders... junkies.

10:10.549 --> 10:11.830
Look at the marks on the bodies.

10:11.884 --> 10:13.985
- They're just like Columbia.
- Yeah.

10:14.086 --> 10:16.354
And the junkie we found
in McCarthy's warehouse.

10:16.455 --> 10:17.989
You think he killed them all?

10:18.090 --> 10:19.456
The first one was found here,

10:19.558 --> 10:21.192
ten miles from McCarthy's farmhouse.

10:21.293 --> 10:23.662
The next two bodies were
found near the music stores

10:23.763 --> 10:24.729
he took out.

10:24.830 --> 10:26.798
One in D.C. and one near Baltimore.

10:26.899 --> 10:28.232
So he's not just a mad bomber?

10:28.333 --> 10:30.434
He's a serial killer, too.

10:30.536 --> 10:31.570
(sighs)

10:31.671 --> 10:33.804
The heroin ring, Columbia, these bodies,

10:33.905 --> 10:34.806
it's all connected,

10:34.907 --> 10:36.408
and McCarthy's the missing link.

10:36.509 --> 10:39.510
And the only lead on Abby.

10:39.611 --> 10:41.413
Not bad for a fed.

10:41.514 --> 10:42.746
So why this shithole?

10:42.847 --> 10:44.849
Contacted a few old FBI informants.

10:44.951 --> 10:46.217
One of these working girls

10:46.318 --> 10:47.952
recognized a picture of McCarthy

10:48.053 --> 10:49.734
and thinks he might be
renting a room here.

10:49.822 --> 10:51.556
- Shh.
- What?

10:51.657 --> 10:53.158
(men chattering)

11:00.298 --> 11:03.201
(creature clicking)

11:07.773 --> 11:08.974
He's here.

11:15.815 --> 11:18.082
(creature clicking)

11:33.164 --> 11:35.734
(muffled gagging sounds)

11:40.438 --> 11:42.240
(gagging sounds continue)

11:50.716 --> 11:52.716
(retching)

12:00.860 --> 12:02.027
(clicking)

12:09.534 --> 12:11.436
Let her go.

12:11.537 --> 12:13.304
(clicking)

12:13.405 --> 12:14.938
On your knees, asshole!

12:15.041 --> 12:18.208
You're lost, girl. I can help you.

12:18.311 --> 12:20.010
I'd say you're the
one need help right now.

12:20.111 --> 12:21.712
Hmm? Yeah.

12:24.716 --> 12:26.784
Hey.

12:26.885 --> 12:29.086
I want my wife.

12:31.465 --> 12:32.932
Hey, attention people!

12:33.052 --> 12:35.788
Thanks to the outstanding
work of Agents Carroll and Regan,

12:35.889 --> 12:39.125
we now have two live
Hunters in our custody.

12:39.225 --> 12:41.693
This is our chance to
ask the big questions.

12:41.794 --> 12:43.461
Who are they?

12:43.562 --> 12:45.563
Where do they come
from? What do they want?

12:45.665 --> 12:47.667
World peace and
friendship bracelets, I'm guessing.

12:47.768 --> 12:50.369
Lionel McCarthy is no foot soldier.

12:50.470 --> 12:53.739
He is leadership... he's
behind the bombings,

12:53.840 --> 12:55.774
Columbian drug operation,

12:55.875 --> 12:57.342
and now several murders here.

12:57.443 --> 12:59.043
He is a direct link to the Hunter leader

12:59.046 --> 13:00.913
known as Brother Number Four.

13:01.014 --> 13:02.615
And he knows what happened to my wife.

13:02.716 --> 13:03.883
Abby is a part of the puzzle,

13:03.984 --> 13:06.384
but this is bigger than
any personal imperative.

13:06.485 --> 13:07.886
I will interrogate McCarthy.

13:07.988 --> 13:09.788
Briggs, Regan, I want
you with the female

13:09.889 --> 13:11.256
in case she regains consciousness.

13:11.357 --> 13:13.125
Carroll, you're cataloging

13:13.225 --> 13:14.759
McCarthy's belongings from the hotel.

13:14.860 --> 13:17.429
Everybody else, Kubark
protocols are in effect.

13:17.530 --> 13:19.631
Our interview room's soundproofed
for Hunters,

13:19.732 --> 13:21.133
and everything that happens in that room

13:21.234 --> 13:22.234
is recorded at all times.

13:22.235 --> 13:24.769
Let's be smart. Let's be careful.

13:24.870 --> 13:26.772
Let's do our best.

13:26.873 --> 13:29.207
(indistinct chatter)

13:29.308 --> 13:31.342
I caught that
asshole, I should be in there.

13:31.445 --> 13:32.644
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

13:32.745 --> 13:34.480
McCarthy's the most important live asset

13:34.581 --> 13:36.048
this unit has ever acquired.

13:36.149 --> 13:38.017
Fine. Not lead, but help.

13:38.118 --> 13:40.286
And you will, by doing your job.

13:40.386 --> 13:42.988
Counting McCarthy's
underwear? That's waste of my time.

13:43.090 --> 13:44.389
McCarthy knows me,

13:44.490 --> 13:46.558
he specifically asked to see me.

13:46.659 --> 13:48.059
I can get under his skin.

13:48.161 --> 13:49.794
I know I can.

13:49.895 --> 13:52.498
Maybe this is why I'm here.

13:55.235 --> 13:57.536
Follow my lead, do you understand me?

13:57.636 --> 13:59.404
Yes, sir.

13:59.505 --> 14:00.873
With a little reverse engineering,

14:00.974 --> 14:03.576
we've managed to turn
their weapons against them.

14:03.677 --> 14:06.278
This one will drop a rhino.

14:06.379 --> 14:08.246
I give you the signal, don't hesitate.

14:08.347 --> 14:10.187
If I can't give you the
signal, don't hesitate.

14:10.216 --> 14:12.817
Don't make me use it on you.

14:12.918 --> 14:14.486
Yes, sir.

14:25.030 --> 14:26.565
Truss Jackson.

14:26.666 --> 14:28.100
(door shuts softly)

14:28.201 --> 14:29.534
Hello, Flynn.

14:32.505 --> 14:35.140
(inhales deeply)

14:35.241 --> 14:36.942
I thought you'd be fatter.

14:37.911 --> 14:38.911
Sorry to disappoint you.

14:39.011 --> 14:41.279
You're human, that's all you can do.

14:41.380 --> 14:42.740
I can't lie and say I haven't been

14:42.816 --> 14:44.350
looking forward to meeting you.

14:44.451 --> 14:46.451
We have a lot to discuss.

14:46.552 --> 14:48.052
Shall we begin?

14:52.292 --> 14:54.527
Thane, Weldon, Hyrum,

14:54.628 --> 14:57.096
Elize, Cambria,

14:57.197 --> 15:00.533
and sweet little Lucia.

15:00.634 --> 15:02.735
Your children have beautiful names.

15:05.605 --> 15:08.374
And of course, I couldn't
forget our precious little orphan.

15:10.309 --> 15:12.043
The poor waif...

15:12.144 --> 15:14.078
like something out of Dickens.

15:14.181 --> 15:17.515
Losing her papa and
her surrogate mother so...

15:17.616 --> 15:20.251
unexpectedly.

15:22.087 --> 15:24.456
That's a... good start.

15:24.557 --> 15:27.793
Tell us more... Lionel.

15:27.894 --> 15:30.863
Well, this is our chance to
get to know each other better,

15:30.963 --> 15:32.965
after that awkward first
date in the warehouse.

15:33.066 --> 15:34.899
So much we didn't get to chat about.

15:35.000 --> 15:38.770
Talk. I'm all ears.

15:38.871 --> 15:44.409
So am I, Agent. So... am... I.

15:47.080 --> 15:50.048
I can hear your heartbeat quicken.

15:50.149 --> 15:51.917
I hear the blood
rushing through your veins,

15:52.018 --> 15:54.019
your muscles tighten.

15:55.588 --> 15:59.091
Your teeth are grinding.

15:59.192 --> 16:02.327
(heartbeat thumping)

16:02.428 --> 16:04.864
I hear your fear, boy.

16:07.833 --> 16:10.535
Diastolic blood pressure, 120 over 44,

16:10.636 --> 16:13.839
heart rate 29,
respiration, seven breaths per minute.

16:13.940 --> 16:15.173
Is that normal for a Hunter?

16:15.274 --> 16:16.875
Not compared to me.

16:16.976 --> 16:19.297
And I've never seen a Hunter
vomit tissue like that before.

16:19.346 --> 16:20.412
Sedation will stop that,

16:20.513 --> 16:22.114
but her condition is deteriorating.

16:22.215 --> 16:24.549
Or in withdrawal. She has track marks.

16:24.650 --> 16:27.385
Alien junkies, it's like we
captured a Corman movie.

16:27.486 --> 16:28.966
Lab analysis on McCarthy's instrument,

16:28.989 --> 16:30.755
the oversized syringe,

16:30.856 --> 16:33.792
small traces of heroin,

16:33.894 --> 16:36.128
but mostly human blood with
a high concentration

16:36.229 --> 16:37.668
of endogenous opioid nerve peptides.

16:39.532 --> 16:41.567
It's a byproduct of heroin use.

16:41.668 --> 16:43.735
Hunters can't get high on heroin.

16:43.836 --> 16:45.937
(Briggs) So they're
shooting up junkie brain blood.

16:46.038 --> 16:48.240
- That's revolting.
- Well, it obviously works.

16:48.341 --> 16:50.509
To take the edge off of
being in a human body.

16:50.610 --> 16:53.511
You wouldn't
believe the shit I've tried.

16:53.613 --> 16:54.913
When I was younger.

16:55.014 --> 16:59.051
Subject has a growth in the
upper back and neck region.

17:09.028 --> 17:12.463
There is no reason for us to be enemies.

17:12.565 --> 17:16.000
We're here to try and
understand what it is you want from us.

17:16.102 --> 17:17.736
From Earth.

17:17.836 --> 17:19.137
Well, it's simple, really.

17:20.807 --> 17:24.509
We are eat. We are kill.

17:24.611 --> 17:27.211
If you won't talk, we'd
like to try and arrange

17:27.314 --> 17:29.615
a meeting with Brother Number Four.

17:29.715 --> 17:33.652
We'd like to show we can be
an honest partner, peaceful.

17:33.752 --> 17:35.354
There's no need for violence.

17:35.454 --> 17:37.588
We've had plenty of opportunities

17:37.691 --> 17:38.891
to observe your E.T.U.

17:38.991 --> 17:40.858
Your government, humankind itself,

17:40.961 --> 17:44.262
we have every reason not
to trust you creatures.

17:44.364 --> 17:46.664
Yeah. We're not perfect.

17:46.766 --> 17:50.035
We make mistakes, but
we learn from them.

17:50.135 --> 17:52.237
Indeed.

17:52.338 --> 17:55.641
I'm sure dissecting my
kind has been very educational.

17:57.978 --> 18:00.078
I wonder what cutting open your wife

18:00.180 --> 18:02.815
would teach my people.

18:02.915 --> 18:05.984
If you continue to hurt humans,

18:06.086 --> 18:11.089
to kill my people, measures
will be taken.

18:11.191 --> 18:14.125
We must protect ours, just
as you would protect yours.

18:14.227 --> 18:16.260
We want to know where you came from,

18:16.363 --> 18:18.830
why you're here, what you want.

18:18.932 --> 18:21.333
Maybe we can help.

18:21.433 --> 18:24.336
What is it about you humans?

18:24.436 --> 18:26.305
You think if you understand everything,

18:26.405 --> 18:28.507
you'll sleep better at night.

18:28.607 --> 18:30.241
Does anybody really need a reason

18:30.343 --> 18:34.012
to swat a fly or... kill a wife?

18:35.815 --> 18:38.116
We spent four days together, Abby and I.

18:38.218 --> 18:41.653
Her neck smelled like lavender and soap.

18:41.755 --> 18:43.588
So tender.

18:44.990 --> 18:46.057
Shattered like glass.

18:53.199 --> 18:54.633
Gutless.

18:58.203 --> 19:00.439
<i>(McCarthy) Good-bye.</i>

19:03.643 --> 19:05.611
(breathing hard)

19:05.711 --> 19:08.747
(door opens and closes)

19:11.984 --> 19:14.553
So much for you getting under his skin.

19:14.653 --> 19:15.753
He's toying with us.

19:15.855 --> 19:17.122
What should we have done?

19:17.222 --> 19:18.156
Beaten him?

19:18.258 --> 19:19.417
That's exactly what he wants.

19:19.425 --> 19:20.959
What we need here is patience.

19:21.060 --> 19:22.227
We don't have time.

19:22.327 --> 19:23.996
He had my wife, damn it, you heard him!

19:24.096 --> 19:25.864
For all we know, that could be a lie,

19:25.964 --> 19:27.665
and Abby is a human collaborator,

19:27.767 --> 19:29.934
or she could be one of them.

19:30.036 --> 19:31.303
You know something I don't?

19:31.403 --> 19:32.738
No.

19:32.838 --> 19:35.207
Which is exactly why we
need to proceed with caution.

19:35.307 --> 19:37.342
Okay, put me back in there

19:37.443 --> 19:38.753
and I'll get the truth out of him.

19:38.755 --> 19:40.445
You had your shot.

19:40.547 --> 19:42.146
You're sitting this one out.

19:45.417 --> 19:47.685
(cell phone vibrating)

19:50.355 --> 19:51.623
Flynn Carroll.

19:53.393 --> 19:54.660
Emme? What?

19:54.760 --> 19:57.296
What do you mean she's not in school?

19:58.765 --> 20:00.665
(heart monitor beeping)

20:03.635 --> 20:05.269
(groaning)

20:13.212 --> 20:14.313
(latches clicking)

20:21.054 --> 20:22.453
(Tasha groaning)

20:24.891 --> 20:25.923
You got one of those?

20:26.025 --> 20:29.827
Oh, yeah. Right above my tramp stamp.

20:34.666 --> 20:35.767
Is it a tumor?

20:35.868 --> 20:37.301
I have no idea.

20:37.403 --> 20:39.770
(Tasha groaning)

20:39.873 --> 20:41.807
(shrieking)

20:44.477 --> 20:46.878
(screaming)

21:00.826 --> 21:02.693
(screaming and moaning)

21:05.030 --> 21:08.099
(Tasha moaning)

21:08.201 --> 21:09.701
(panting)

21:11.171 --> 21:13.105
Regan!

21:19.778 --> 21:21.113
(squishing)

21:41.701 --> 21:43.067
(clicking)

21:46.038 --> 21:48.472
(clicking)

21:58.180 --> 21:59.967
ETU's suddenly a breeding facility.

21:59.969 --> 22:00.968
I didn't see that one coming.

22:00.970 --> 22:02.001
No one did.

22:02.003 --> 22:03.069
And the mother's condition?

22:03.071 --> 22:04.037
Not good.

22:04.038 --> 22:05.005
We're doing everything we can

22:05.007 --> 22:06.807
- to ensure it survives.
- You better.

22:06.875 --> 22:08.234
What have you gotten from McCarthy?

22:08.242 --> 22:09.710
Nothing yet.

22:09.778 --> 22:12.211
Hours in captivity and you have nothing.

22:12.279 --> 22:13.814
Truss, this is a critical window.

22:13.882 --> 22:15.682
If you can't do
it... There's something else.

22:15.750 --> 22:18.986
Agent Carroll's adopted
daughter Emme has gone missing.

22:19.053 --> 22:20.520
And this concerns me how?

22:20.587 --> 22:22.722
McCarthy previously threatened her life.

22:22.790 --> 22:24.991
Whose life hasn't he threatened?

22:25.058 --> 22:29.430
(Flynn) I need a
bulletin, not a missing person.

22:29.497 --> 22:31.765
It's a suspected kidnapping.

22:31.833 --> 22:33.534
Thanks, Reyes.

22:38.338 --> 22:40.707
(heart monitor beeping)

22:43.444 --> 22:45.846
Why do you think the
Hunters took your daughter?

22:45.913 --> 22:47.013
They took my wife.

22:47.080 --> 22:48.382
Well, your wife's a Hunter,

22:48.450 --> 22:50.451
and she took your daughter.

22:52.753 --> 22:56.722
I want back in there. Alone.

22:56.790 --> 22:58.125
(Jackson) That's out of the question.

22:58.192 --> 23:00.493
It's not your call, Commander.

23:00.561 --> 23:02.628
In you go, Agent Carroll.

23:02.696 --> 23:04.698
Use that broken heart.

23:04.766 --> 23:06.767
Thank you, ma'am.

23:15.777 --> 23:20.948
Love swings the hammer...
so it can swing for us, also.

23:21.015 --> 23:24.585
Congratulations, Dad.

23:24.652 --> 23:27.354
You feeling all warm and fuzzy?

23:27.422 --> 23:30.457
How is the baby?

23:30.525 --> 23:32.291
Does it have my eyes?

23:32.359 --> 23:33.826
You'll never know.

23:33.894 --> 23:35.996
I'll just have to
comfort myself with Abby

23:36.064 --> 23:37.897
and delicious little
Emme, then, won't I?

23:37.965 --> 23:40.267
Tell me where they are...

23:40.335 --> 23:43.269
or I'll tear your face off.

23:43.337 --> 23:45.271
Oh, please... take it off.

23:45.339 --> 23:46.138
I can't wait.

23:46.207 --> 23:49.041
Where the hell are they?!

23:49.109 --> 23:50.711
Is this really how you're gonna question

23:50.778 --> 23:52.458
the most valuable
prisoner you've ever had,

23:52.513 --> 23:55.515
with this dumb, blunt instrument?

24:09.364 --> 24:11.431
- Uhh!
- Ohh! No!

24:11.499 --> 24:13.432
Not the money maker.

24:15.869 --> 24:18.638
<i>Do I have to spell it out for you?</i>

24:18.705 --> 24:21.942
You can't torture a Hunter.

24:22.009 --> 24:23.410
Especially not me.

24:23.478 --> 24:24.944
(chuckling) In truth, you can't get much

24:25.012 --> 24:26.613
out of torturing a human, either,

24:26.681 --> 24:28.981
but that doesn't keep
you fools from trying.

24:30.183 --> 24:32.451
But we know so little about your kind.

24:34.689 --> 24:37.423
We got so much to learn.

24:37.491 --> 24:39.459
Like your ears.

24:39.527 --> 24:40.727
You know...

24:40.795 --> 24:43.329
What makes them so sensitive?

24:45.098 --> 24:46.567
Careful...

24:46.634 --> 24:48.535
You break it, you buy it.

24:48.603 --> 24:51.404
Oh, yeah, I'll be careful.

24:51.471 --> 24:52.806
- There.
- Guh!

24:54.709 --> 24:56.009
(groaning)

25:02.349 --> 25:03.750
Come again?

25:03.817 --> 25:05.152
I can't hear you.

25:06.520 --> 25:07.688
Yeah?

25:07.755 --> 25:09.589
Uhh! Agh!

25:23.070 --> 25:25.172
Hunters aren't invulnerable.

found their weakness yet.

25:27.275 --> 25:28.442
Jules, any thoughts?

25:28.509 --> 25:30.810
(Jules) We could rig up
one of the sonic weapons.

25:30.877 --> 25:32.511
Decrease the intensity. It's too risky.

25:32.579 --> 25:33.947

25:34.015 --> 25:35.915
the best source of intel we've ever had.

25:37.484 --> 25:39.353
What about that
treatment we devised for Regan?

25:39.420 --> 25:42.189
She reported discomfort at the
higher amplitudes, right?

25:42.256 --> 25:44.391
The treatment was
intended to help Regan's urges,

25:44.459 --> 25:45.459
not harm her.

25:45.526 --> 25:46.993
It's a tool.

25:47.060 --> 25:49.028
I don't care what it was intended
for if it does the job.

25:49.096 --> 25:50.096
Bring it in.

25:57.038 --> 25:59.271
(heart monitor beeping)

26:09.049 --> 26:11.817
Will it look like a
human when it grows up?

26:11.885 --> 26:13.787
It's hard to say.

26:15.556 --> 26:17.036
Human embryos look like other mammals

26:17.090 --> 26:19.326
at various stages of development.

26:19.394 --> 26:22.729
Or it could be some sort of hybrid.

26:22.797 --> 26:25.999
The mother's in no
condition to answer any questions.

26:34.575 --> 26:35.776
Hey.

26:37.478 --> 26:39.712

Not really.

26:50.424 --> 26:52.025

26:53.193 --> 26:54.126
I don't know.

26:54.194 --> 26:56.630
My parents didn't have baby pictures.

27:01.335 --> 27:03.970
I can't believe it came from McCarthy.

waters of moral compromise.

(screaming)

38:48.038 --> 38:49.237
(Jackson grunting)

38:51.675 --> 38:53.275
Uhh!

38:57.614 --> 38:59.849
The baby's not breathing! Help me!

39:07.909 --> 39:10.411
Emme! Abby!

39:12.112 --> 39:13.414
Emme!

39:14.681 --> 39:15.916
Abby!

39:18.719 --> 39:20.219
Emme!

39:26.561 --> 39:28.362
(door rattles)

39:32.833 --> 39:35.802
(panting)

39:35.903 --> 39:37.603
(cell phone vibrating)

39:38.706 --> 39:39.806
(grunts)

39:42.143 --> 39:44.210
<i>- Yeah?
- Carroll, it's Reyes.</i>

39:44.311 --> 39:45.112
<i>We found Em.</i>

39:45.213 --> 39:47.181
Is she all right? Wh-where is she?

39:47.282 --> 39:49.215
<i>She's safe, unharmed.</i>

39:49.317 --> 39:51.985
<i>Squad car picked her up a
few miles from her school,</i>

39:52.086 --> 39:53.554
<i>dropped her back home.</i>

39:53.655 --> 39:56.123
<i>- Where was she?
- Didn't say.</i>

39:56.224 --> 39:58.092
<i>We'll keep an eye on
her till you get there.</i>

39:58.193 --> 39:59.092
Thanks.

39:59.193 --> 40:01.128
I'll be there as soon as I can.

40:02.630 --> 40:03.764
(phone beeps off)

40:16.911 --> 40:19.847
Police found Agent Carroll's daughter.

40:19.947 --> 40:22.615
She wasn't at the storage facility.

40:22.717 --> 40:24.083
McCarthy played us.

40:24.184 --> 40:26.119
We underestimated him.

40:26.221 --> 40:28.588
I accept full responsibility.

40:28.690 --> 40:29.822
No.

40:29.923 --> 40:32.726
We both underestimated him.

40:32.827 --> 40:35.161
But it won't happen again.

40:35.262 --> 40:36.697
I'm removing him from your custody.

40:36.797 --> 40:38.231
What?

40:38.333 --> 40:39.867
And placing him where?

40:39.967 --> 40:41.902
In a more secure facility.

40:42.003 --> 40:43.603
Where?

40:43.704 --> 40:46.306
There's no one else who
understands the Hunters

40:46.407 --> 40:47.407
like we do.

40:47.509 --> 40:48.675
It's done.

41:08.862 --> 41:11.197
And they saw the heavens open.

41:13.635 --> 41:16.170
And they saw the angels
descending out of Heaven

41:16.271 --> 41:17.804
as in the midst of fire.

41:17.905 --> 41:19.639
And they came down and encircled

41:19.740 --> 41:23.143
those little ones about with fire.

41:23.244 --> 41:27.114
And the angels did minister unto them.

41:27.215 --> 41:28.347
You're praying.

41:31.985 --> 41:35.355
My faith, uh, teaches that
the souls of little children

41:35.456 --> 41:40.193
who die are taken by
God because they are...

41:40.295 --> 41:42.496
too pure, too lovely...

41:44.932 --> 41:46.233
to live on earth.

41:47.969 --> 41:49.369
Even Hunters?

41:52.206 --> 41:56.043
Do you think I have a soul?

41:56.143 --> 41:58.344
Yes, I do.
