00:04.600 --> 00:06.272
Here. This is for you.

00:08.880 --> 00:10.518
Thank you.

00:11.120 --> 00:13.429
And I didn't get you anything.

00:14.520 --> 00:15.839
It's your kid's toilet seat.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.560
It's obviously in his way,
and I'm tired of cleaning it.

00:19.680 --> 00:21.079
Oh, come on, Berta.

00:21.240 --> 00:23.470
- He's 11.
- He's a pig.

00:23.840 --> 00:25.114
I'll talk to him.

00:25.280 --> 00:27.271
While you're at it,
you may wanna mention...

00:27.440 --> 00:29.670
...the half-eaten egg salad sandwiches
in his toy chest...

00:29.840 --> 00:31.512
...the dead marine life
at the back of the closet...

00:31.680 --> 00:33.875
...and the booger collection
under the bed.

00:34.040 --> 00:35.996
I'll do my best
to address your concerns.

00:36.160 --> 00:39.152
Don't condescend to me, Zippy.
I'll snap you like a butter bean.

00:40.920 --> 00:42.751
Excuse me. Is one of you Alan?

00:49.240 --> 00:50.514
I'm Alan.

00:50.920 --> 00:53.354
Oh, good.
Charlie wants you to come upstairs.

00:53.800 --> 00:57.713
- Why?
- Well, it's kind of hard to explain.

00:57.880 --> 01:00.519
- Try.
- Oh, yeah, try.

01:01.320 --> 01:02.753
Well, he's kind of stuck.

01:06.160 --> 01:07.434
- In what?
- In what?

01:08.000 --> 01:10.833
Not in anything, just stuck.

01:11.280 --> 01:13.316
Would you hurry?

01:16.280 --> 01:19.431
- Where are you going?
- Oh, like I'm gonna miss this?

01:24.160 --> 01:26.310
Charlie? Are you okay?

01:26.480 --> 01:29.631
Do I look okay?

01:29.800 --> 01:34.430
- What happened?
- I pulled my back.

01:34.600 --> 01:37.592
I didn't do anything. I was lying there
and he started screaming.

01:37.760 --> 01:40.593
- I understand.
- I mean, I wasn't just lying there.

01:40.760 --> 01:43.832
- I got it.
- Damn, I wish I had a camera.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.833
That's okay. It's all on video.

01:58.480 --> 02:01.552
Alan, you're a chiropractor.
Do something.

02:02.040 --> 02:03.917
Really? You want my help?

02:04.080 --> 02:06.799
Even after you referred to
my profession as, what was it...

02:06.960 --> 02:08.551
..."urban voodoo"?

02:09.479 --> 02:11.630
I'm sorry. Now help me.

02:11.800 --> 02:13.711
Okay. Okay.
We'll see what we can do.

02:18.560 --> 02:20.710
Yeah, yeah, okay,
very funny, very funny.

02:20.880 --> 02:23.440
Hold on.
Berta, I'm gonna need a dead rooster.

02:24.080 --> 02:25.718
Check your kid's room.

02:26.360 --> 02:29.238
Excuse me, Charlie, sorry you're
not feeling well, but I have an audition.

02:29.400 --> 02:32.597
- Go.
- It's a Wheat Thins commercial.

02:33.080 --> 02:36.038
- I'm an actress.
- Of course you are.

02:36.800 --> 02:38.074
I had a nice time, Charlie.

02:38.680 --> 02:40.238
- I'll call you.
- Great.

02:40.400 --> 02:42.391
Oh, if you find my tongue stud,
let me know.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.116
Okay, let's see what we've got here.

02:47.760 --> 02:50.149
- Is this tender?
- A little.

02:50.320 --> 02:53.073
- On a scale of one to ten?
- I don't know. Three?

02:53.240 --> 02:56.198
- Okay, what about this?
- Four.

02:56.360 --> 02:58.590
And what about this?

03:00.520 --> 03:02.670
I'm gonna need a number, Charlie.

03:03.200 --> 03:05.350
No, no, I changed my mind.
Leave me alone.

03:05.520 --> 03:07.556
Oh, don't be a baby.

03:07.720 --> 03:09.631
- Stay away.
- I have to examine you.

03:09.800 --> 03:11.995
- It's okay. I'm better.
- No, you're not.

03:12.160 --> 03:15.038
- Now, stop moving.
- Really, I'm fine. Just don't...

03:17.840 --> 03:21.515
Ten. Ten. That's a ten.

03:21.920 --> 03:24.798
- Are you happy?
- Do I look happy?

03:25.360 --> 03:27.920
Let's get you back on the bed
so I can give you an adjustment.

03:28.080 --> 03:29.354
No, no, no, no. New plan.

03:29.520 --> 03:31.397
I need someone
who can give me drugs.

03:31.560 --> 03:34.438
I'm not holding,
but I can make a couple calls.

03:34.600 --> 03:36.238
Drugs just mask the problem.

03:36.400 --> 03:39.597
Fine, mask it. Throw a cape on it,
and let it fight crime.

03:39.760 --> 03:41.591
I just want it to go away.

03:41.760 --> 03:45.275
Good news. I think I know where
Wheat Thins lost her tongue stud.

03:50.680 --> 03:52.079
For the love of God.

03:53.200 --> 03:56.192
Oh, mommy.

03:59.520 --> 04:01.112
Feeling better?

04:01.320 --> 04:04.153
No, I just passed out for a second.

04:06.040 --> 04:08.031
Berta, I'm gonna take Charlie
to the doctor.

04:08.200 --> 04:10.430
- You keep an eye on Jake.
- Fine.

04:10.600 --> 04:12.238
Whoa, hey.

04:12.400 --> 04:14.516
And please put his toilet seat back on.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.230
I really think you should
put on your seat belt.

04:21.560 --> 04:23.596
Do you now?

04:23.920 --> 04:27.629
Did you forget it took three of us
just to put on my shorts?

04:27.800 --> 04:31.315
Suit yourself. I should call your doctor
and tell him we're coming.

04:31.480 --> 04:33.710
- What's his number?
- I don't know.

04:33.880 --> 04:38.476
All right, I'll call directory assistance.
What's his name? Where's he located?

04:38.640 --> 04:41.108
Dr. Schwartz. Beverly Hills.

04:42.040 --> 04:45.874
- You're kidding, right?
- Do I look like I'm kidding?

04:46.640 --> 04:48.198
Well, I need a first name.

04:50.560 --> 04:54.269
I remember his
receptionist's name. Julie.

04:54.440 --> 04:57.000
Cute redhead with a slight
speech impediment.

04:57.160 --> 04:58.991
She called me "Charlie."

05:01.520 --> 05:03.112
I almost asked her out once...

05:03.280 --> 05:05.555
...but I couldn't face
the inevitable phone calls.

05:05.720 --> 05:09.508
"I love you, Charlie.
Don't leave me."

05:10.040 --> 05:13.715
Yeah, yeah,
and your doctor's first name is?

05:15.120 --> 05:16.473
Oh, I have no idea.

05:17.640 --> 05:19.358
Idiot.

05:20.760 --> 05:23.069
Yes, Beverly Hills, California.

05:23.240 --> 05:25.276
Dr. Schwartz.

05:25.440 --> 05:27.590
Yeah, I don't know the first name.

05:27.840 --> 05:30.115
No, I'm not kidding.

05:31.520 --> 05:34.512
There are 128 Dr. Schwartzes
in Beverly Hills.

05:34.680 --> 05:36.159
What street is he on?

05:36.320 --> 05:38.072
Wilshire Boulevard, I think.

05:38.240 --> 05:40.913
Wilshire Boulevard, we think.

05:41.640 --> 05:44.074
Okay, we're down to 47 Schwartzes.

05:44.680 --> 05:48.275
Just forget it. Drive down Wilshire.
I'll know the building when I see it.

05:48.440 --> 05:49.919
Never mind, we're gonna play...

05:50.080 --> 05:52.071
...Find the Jewish
Doctor in Beverly Hills.

05:52.840 --> 05:54.159
Wait, wait. There it is.

05:59.440 --> 06:01.431
Now, you see,
that wouldn't have happened...

06:01.600 --> 06:03.750
...if you'd been wearing your seat belt.

06:04.200 --> 06:06.430
Alan, if I can ever use my legs again...

06:06.600 --> 06:10.832
...the first thing I'm gonna do
is kick your ass into your throat.

06:18.560 --> 06:20.710
That's not Julie.

06:22.280 --> 06:26.068
- So?
- It's just important to me that you know.

06:26.720 --> 06:29.359
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I'm Charlie Harper.

06:29.520 --> 06:32.034
- I need to see my doctor.
- Do you have an appointment?

06:32.200 --> 06:33.553
No, but this is an emergency.

06:33.720 --> 06:36.280
He has to get back to Notre Dame
and ring the bell.

06:37.800 --> 06:41.509
Oh, I get it. He's hunched over.
That's funny.

06:43.160 --> 06:45.196
Yeah, can I see my doctor, please?

06:45.360 --> 06:46.998
- Who's your doctor?
- Dr. Schwartz.

06:47.160 --> 06:48.957
- Stanley Schwartz?
- Yes, Stanley.

06:49.120 --> 06:51.429
- It's Stanley.
- Thank you.

06:51.600 --> 06:53.511
When was the last time
you were here?

06:53.720 --> 06:56.280
I don't know.
A couple of years ago. Why?

06:56.680 --> 07:01.037
- Dr. Schwartz passed away.
- Oh, no.

07:01.280 --> 07:02.679
So where's Julie?

07:03.520 --> 07:04.999
Julie we had to let go.

07:05.160 --> 07:09.392
She was playing a little fast and loose
with the old prescription pad.

07:10.960 --> 07:13.713
I'm guessing Valium.

07:15.200 --> 07:17.031
Is there somebody else
who can see him?

07:17.200 --> 07:19.316
Yeah, but not Dr. Schwartz's doctor,
okay?

07:19.480 --> 07:21.710
Dr. Talmadge took over
Dr. Schwartz's practice.

07:21.880 --> 07:24.519
It's a little tight right now,
but I could squeeze you in.

07:25.120 --> 07:27.190
That's kind of how this happened.

07:27.840 --> 07:30.991
Oh, my. So this was a sexual injury.

07:34.040 --> 07:36.076
Well, thank goodness you're okay.

07:46.600 --> 07:49.273
This is really gross.
Why do I have to do it?

07:49.440 --> 07:51.351
- You want your toilet seat back?
- Yes.

07:51.520 --> 07:53.556
Then keep scrubbing.

07:54.560 --> 07:58.075
You know, taking it wasn't funny.
I could have broke my butt.

07:58.240 --> 08:00.276
Oh, come on.
How could that not be funny?

08:02.680 --> 08:06.116
Don't forget to clean on the outside.
That's all you.

08:06.520 --> 08:09.796
- And the floor, and the wall.
- Okay, okay.

08:09.960 --> 08:12.110
How in the hell
did you hit the wall anyway?

08:12.280 --> 08:15.477
I don't know,
it just gets away from me sometimes.

08:16.880 --> 08:18.393
After a day scrubbing toilets...

08:18.560 --> 08:22.473
...I'm betting you'll be able to pee
through a Cheerio at 10 paces.

08:23.560 --> 08:25.391
Oh, God.

08:25.560 --> 08:27.676
Oh, jeez.

08:27.840 --> 08:29.114
Hey, guess what.

08:29.280 --> 08:32.238
The Soviet Union
is boycotting the Olympics.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.230
My pain is just a big joke
to you, isn't it?

08:40.400 --> 08:43.119
I offered to help you, Charlie,
and you refused, so...

08:43.280 --> 08:44.315
...yeah.

08:45.840 --> 08:48.877
I'll tell you, if you came to me
as a patient in this much pain...

08:49.040 --> 08:51.429
...I wouldn't make you wait.
I'd see you right away.

08:51.600 --> 08:54.910
So would my dry cleaner,
but I don't let him touch me either.

08:55.080 --> 08:56.513
I could help you, Charlie.

08:56.680 --> 08:59.069
I've already isolated
the source of your discomfort.

08:59.240 --> 09:01.629
All that's left would be
to realign your vertebrae...

09:01.800 --> 09:03.916
...through a gentle series
of manipulations and stretches...

09:04.080 --> 09:05.593
...thereby alleviating your pain.

09:08.280 --> 09:10.840
Well, you didn't explain it like that.
That's different.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.639
- So you'll let me work on you?
- Not in a million years.

09:15.200 --> 09:18.431
Fine. Worship at the altar
of the American Medical Association.

09:18.600 --> 09:21.114
Swallow the pharmaceutical companies'
propaganda.

09:21.280 --> 09:24.716
I'll swallow it, I'll sniff it,
I'll insert it rectally.

09:26.440 --> 09:28.954
Anything to kill the pain.
I'm dying here.

09:29.720 --> 09:31.517
Mr. Harper, I'm Dr. Talmadge.

09:31.680 --> 09:34.069
Hello, doctor.

09:36.360 --> 09:38.635
Hallelujah. It's a miracle.

09:42.800 --> 09:44.552
So I see you're having some back pain.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.514
That will be $ 100, please.

09:49.280 --> 09:51.111
Yeah, it started in my back...

09:51.280 --> 09:55.353
...but now it's kind of radiating out
into a body-wide unbearable agony.

09:55.520 --> 09:58.318
You have a really cute little nose,
you know that?

09:59.080 --> 10:01.799
- Did the pain start in your lower back?
- Best I can tell...

10:01.960 --> 10:03.678
...it's a spasm between
L4 and L5.

10:03.840 --> 10:06.035
- Oh, are you a doctor?
- Yes, I'm a chiropractor.

10:06.200 --> 10:08.077
So no.

10:10.440 --> 10:11.759
How did this happen?

10:11.920 --> 10:14.309
Well, I slipped.

10:14.520 --> 10:16.511
On an actress.

10:17.440 --> 10:19.317
I can handle this, Alan.

10:19.480 --> 10:21.710
Okay, see, the thing is,
I was in the middle of...

10:21.880 --> 10:23.438
An actress.

10:24.200 --> 10:25.599
I'm warning you.

10:25.760 --> 10:28.877
- Do the details really matter?
- No, no, I think I got the picture.

10:29.040 --> 10:31.349
There's video if you need it.

10:32.160 --> 10:33.434
Keep it up.

10:33.960 --> 10:36.349
Okay, I see here your last visit
was four years ago.

10:36.520 --> 10:38.431
A mild hernia brought about by...

10:38.600 --> 10:40.511
Okay. I think I'm seeing
a pattern here.

10:41.720 --> 10:44.518
He's a sexual compulsive
with narcissistic tendencies.

10:44.680 --> 10:46.875
Oh, so you're
a pretend psychiatrist too.

10:50.520 --> 10:52.431
So, what's the course
of treatment here?

10:52.600 --> 10:55.194
A pill, a shot?
Maybe one of those epidurals?

10:55.360 --> 10:58.079
First I'm going to get
your blood pressure and take x-rays.

10:58.240 --> 11:01.915
- I take blood pressure and x-rays.
- Your mother must be very proud.

11:02.520 --> 11:04.431
Actually, no.

11:04.920 --> 11:06.717
Someone will be in
to take you to x-ray.

11:06.880 --> 11:08.711
Wait. I'm still in pain.

11:09.040 --> 11:10.917
Try and hang in there.
In the meantime...

11:11.080 --> 11:13.355
...maybe your little buddy
can give you a massage.

11:16.320 --> 11:20.029
- Can you believe her?
- Yeah, she is something else.

11:20.200 --> 11:22.919
Please don't tell me you're interested
in that condescending...

11:23.080 --> 11:24.593
...arrogant excuse for a woman.

11:24.760 --> 11:27.069
Pardon me, Alan,
but that is a condescending...

11:27.240 --> 11:29.800
...arrogant, hot excuse for a woman.

11:29.960 --> 11:33.111
She's just your typical obnoxious MD.

11:33.280 --> 11:35.271
I'm a doctor.
I have special license plates.

11:35.440 --> 11:37.874
I can park wherever I want.

11:38.920 --> 11:41.229
I know where I wanna park.

11:41.800 --> 11:44.360
You're unbelievable.
Does your penis have an off switch?

11:45.360 --> 11:46.759
A pause button?

11:46.920 --> 11:49.354
No, just a little freckle.

11:50.440 --> 11:53.034
You're always telling me I should date
a better class of woman.

11:53.200 --> 11:54.599
What's classier than a doctor?

11:54.760 --> 11:58.309
Oh, please. Four years of med school,
two years of internship...

11:58.480 --> 12:02.234
...a year of residency,
and everybody thinks they're so special.

12:02.400 --> 12:04.675
But I'll tell you something.
A new day is dawning.

12:04.840 --> 12:08.355
A day of reckoning.
And it is spelled HMO.

12:10.440 --> 12:13.432
No more country clubs.
No more Cadillacs.

12:13.600 --> 12:18.037
Just sky-high insurance premiums
and low, slow, copay reimbursements.

12:18.200 --> 12:21.158
Just like the rest of us.

12:21.720 --> 12:24.473
I'll bet she knows a lot
of secret anatomy stuff.

12:25.760 --> 12:29.275
You know, places you touch
and the top of your head flies off.

12:30.920 --> 12:33.832
If you have sex with a doctor,
there's a chance they'll split...

12:34.000 --> 12:36.195
...in the middle of the night
for an emergency.

12:36.360 --> 12:38.396
Well, that's just a price
you'll have to pay.

12:38.560 --> 12:41.074
No, no. That works for me.

12:43.360 --> 12:45.715
Okay, I finished the toilet,
the shower...

12:45.880 --> 12:48.838
...and the sink.
- What took you so long?

12:49.000 --> 12:51.992
I went to the bathroom,
and I had to start over.

12:53.240 --> 12:55.470
Take these, and get started
on the kitchen floor.

12:55.640 --> 12:57.596
Why? I didn't pee in here.

12:59.600 --> 13:01.192
Okay, once, but it was in the sink.

13:02.720 --> 13:04.790
The sink? How'd you manage that?

13:04.960 --> 13:08.316
It's not that hard. You just gotta
drink a lot of root beer, lean back...

13:08.480 --> 13:10.198
...and figure the angle.

13:14.600 --> 13:16.556
So tell me about Dr. Talmadge.

13:16.720 --> 13:19.553
- Is she seeing anybody?
- Yes.

13:19.720 --> 13:22.837
- Is it serious?
- Dog bite.

13:23.560 --> 13:25.630
- No, I mean...
- Charlie, give it a rest.

13:25.800 --> 13:27.153
What?

13:27.320 --> 13:30.437
You're sitting here in pain
because of a casual sexual encounter...

13:30.600 --> 13:32.795
...and now you're trying
to drum up another one.

13:33.880 --> 13:37.077
- Yeah, so?
- Don't you get it?

13:37.240 --> 13:38.958
Your entire life is about jumping...

13:39.120 --> 13:41.918
...from one shallow,
meaningless relationship to the next.

13:42.720 --> 13:44.153
And?

13:44.760 --> 13:47.115
You're a grown man.
You can't go through life...

13:47.280 --> 13:50.636
...drinking and partying and humping
anything that doesn't shake you off.

13:51.160 --> 13:53.310
Yes, I can.

13:53.480 --> 13:55.630
But sooner or later,
it's gonna catch up to you.

13:55.800 --> 13:57.756
Eventually,
you will have to pay the piper.

13:57.920 --> 13:59.876
- Who says?
- Everybody says.

14:00.040 --> 14:02.076
Really? Because I'm just hearing you.

14:02.600 --> 14:05.751
If 2000 years of human history
has taught us anything...

14:05.920 --> 14:08.309
...it's that there is karmic justice
in the world...

14:08.480 --> 14:10.755
...and that when people live
the way you do...

14:10.920 --> 14:13.195
...bad things happen to them
to even things out.

14:13.360 --> 14:15.237
Well, I don't agree.

14:15.880 --> 14:17.438
It's not up for debate.

14:17.600 --> 14:20.194
It's a law, like gravity.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.271
Oh, I agree with gravity.

14:22.440 --> 14:24.749
Good, we wouldn't want you
flying off the planet...

14:24.920 --> 14:26.672
...with nothing to hump
but satellites.

14:26.840 --> 14:29.274
If it makes you feel better,
something bad happened.

14:29.440 --> 14:31.635
- I'm in excruciating pain.
- That's not enough.

14:32.360 --> 14:34.555
Trust me, Charlie.
The piper has yet to be paid.

14:34.720 --> 14:38.076
The only question is how high a tab
you want before the bill comes due.

14:39.760 --> 14:41.876
Okay. I get it.

14:42.360 --> 14:44.112
Well, good.

14:44.520 --> 14:47.637
So you think I have a shot
with that doctor, or what?

14:50.080 --> 14:53.277
It's like trying to talk Shakespeare
to a Hershey bar.

14:57.800 --> 14:59.677
Who's Piper?

15:03.320 --> 15:07.836
Oh, you poor, clueless bitch.
Never trust a drifter with an eye patch.

15:08.960 --> 15:10.712
- Berta.
- What?

15:10.880 --> 15:12.996
I'm tired,
and my hands are all red and pruney.

15:13.160 --> 15:15.037
I've seen your grades. Get used to it.

15:17.240 --> 15:18.514
How do I know when I'm done?

15:18.680 --> 15:20.716
Don't worry about that, honey,
I'll tell you.

15:20.880 --> 15:24.589
Oh, for God's sakes, don't kiss him.
He's your brother.

15:26.160 --> 15:28.310
- I have x-rays.
- Oh, good. Let me see them.

15:28.480 --> 15:30.232
Oh, golly, no. Only for a doctor.

15:30.920 --> 15:33.036
Hey, I'm a doctor.

15:33.200 --> 15:35.156
Oh, yeah? Where you parked?

15:39.240 --> 15:40.958
Alan, you gotta relax.

15:41.120 --> 15:44.476
You're harboring the kind of resentment
that eats away at your insides...

15:44.640 --> 15:47.996
...until you wake up one day
peeing blood and crapping into a bag.

15:48.160 --> 15:49.639
Thanks for the advice.

15:49.800 --> 15:51.836
You know the difference
between you and me?

15:52.000 --> 15:53.319
I have a functioning liver...

15:53.480 --> 15:55.550
...and somehow,
you're gonna get laid tonight.

15:56.320 --> 15:59.676
That's ridiculous, Alan.
She's an educated professional.

15:59.840 --> 16:02.593
Probably gonna have to throw
a few fancy meals at her first.

16:02.760 --> 16:04.876
Boo-hoo, you'll have to wait
a couple of weeks.

16:05.040 --> 16:06.632
Couple of weeks?

16:08.440 --> 16:10.431
Anyway, the difference
between you and me...

16:10.600 --> 16:13.273
...is that when life gives me lemons,
I make lemonade.

16:13.440 --> 16:15.908
When you get lemons,
you just bite into them...

16:16.080 --> 16:18.196
...and suck them inside out.

16:19.600 --> 16:22.876
Okay. Let's see what we've got.

16:25.080 --> 16:26.832
No fractures, no dislocations.

16:27.000 --> 16:30.675
- Looks like just a simple muscle spasm.
- Between L4 and L5?

16:30.840 --> 16:33.229
Oh, good for you.

16:33.680 --> 16:36.558
Okay, I am gonna give you a shot,
which should ease the pain...

16:36.720 --> 16:38.995
...and also allow
your muscles to relax.

16:39.160 --> 16:40.718
Have you had Demerol before?

16:40.880 --> 16:42.393
No, but I've heard nice
things about it.

16:43.160 --> 16:45.549
Okay, I'm just gonna pull
your shorts down a little.

16:45.720 --> 16:48.393
But Dr. Talmadge,
I don't even know your first name.

16:48.560 --> 16:50.915
- Michelle.
- Michelle.

16:51.080 --> 16:52.433
That's prettier than Stanley.

16:56.080 --> 16:57.877
- Sorry.
- That's okay.

16:58.040 --> 17:01.999
It's all part of the little meet-cute
thing we got going here.

17:04.119 --> 17:06.792
So how long does it take
before I start feeling...

17:10.839 --> 17:12.637
...happy.

17:14.760 --> 17:18.833
Happy, happy, happy.
Happy.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.309
Michelle, did you know
I have a house on the beach?

17:21.880 --> 17:25.236
- Really? I love the beach.
- Oh, good, because I have a house there.

17:26.920 --> 17:30.151
Wait outside, I need to give your brother
a hernia exam to make sure...

17:30.320 --> 17:32.993
...he hasn't reinjured the area.
- A hernia exam.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.878
- And your boxers.
- Bye-bye, boxers.

17:42.640 --> 17:44.551
I was wrong. There's no justice.

17:44.720 --> 17:46.870
I thought there was justice,
but there's not.

17:47.040 --> 17:48.598
What, you think there's justice?

17:48.760 --> 17:50.796
Because there's not.

17:51.360 --> 17:52.634
Turn your head and cough.

17:55.560 --> 17:57.994
- You have very warm hands.
- Again.

17:58.160 --> 18:00.469
You have very warm hands.

18:04.360 --> 18:06.794
So any chance I could
take you out for dinner tonight?

18:06.960 --> 18:09.997
- You're hitting on me?
- You started it.

18:10.160 --> 18:12.879
- You're amazing.
- Well, statistically...

18:13.040 --> 18:15.873
...I'm only slightly above average.

18:16.280 --> 18:19.477
But I make up for it
with enthusiasm and perseverance.

18:19.640 --> 18:22.108
No, what's amazing
is that you don't remember me.

18:22.280 --> 18:23.838
Well, sure I remember you.

18:24.000 --> 18:27.072
You're the pretty woman cupping
my testicles from earlier.

18:27.240 --> 18:30.755
Back when I was in medical school,
you and I went out for a couple months.

18:34.080 --> 18:35.911
You wanna loosen your grip there?

18:36.440 --> 18:38.192
Then for reasons I never understood...

18:38.360 --> 18:40.999
...you stopped calling me,
and started seeing my roommate.

18:42.360 --> 18:44.316
The grip.

18:45.520 --> 18:47.590
I always hoped I'd run into you again.

18:47.960 --> 18:51.635
Please. Just leave me one.

18:52.520 --> 18:55.034
Oh, dear God.

18:55.680 --> 18:58.148
My brother's making lemonade.

19:03.760 --> 19:05.352
I need to go to the bathroom.

19:05.520 --> 19:07.238
So go.

19:10.320 --> 19:11.958
Oh, yeah.

19:20.880 --> 19:22.393
Good night.
I'll see you tomorrow.

19:22.560 --> 19:24.118
- Night.
- Night.

19:24.280 --> 19:27.192
So, are you gonna tell me
what happened with you and the doctor?

19:27.360 --> 19:28.634
What do you think happened?

19:29.920 --> 19:31.797
I think she shot you full of drugs...

19:31.960 --> 19:33.996
...you dropped trou,
she jumped your bones...

19:34.160 --> 19:36.549
...and you're the luckiest bastard
to walk the earth.

19:37.240 --> 19:39.913
Well, for your information...

19:40.080 --> 19:42.435
...that's exactly what happened.

19:44.280 --> 19:46.475
Not even a little justice.

19:46.640 --> 19:50.235
This is a justice-free zone.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.958
Looking for justice?
Sorry, fresh out.

19:55.320 --> 19:57.754
Enjoy sucking on that lemon.

19:59.680 --> 20:02.148
Nope, not yet.
