00:00.208 --> 00:02.820
- Previously on <i>Awkward...</i>
- You want another chance?

00:02.945 --> 00:04.880
- I won't screw up again.
- I came with Jake.

00:05.046 --> 00:07.716
But you can stay with me.

00:08.257 --> 00:10.636
I should wash my mouth out.
I puked in the sink.

00:10.802 --> 00:13.472
- I'm all in.
- This came in the mail for you.

00:17.057 --> 00:19.019
With the new year came freedom.

00:19.185 --> 00:21.980
I had a boyfriend who was happy
to be seen with me

00:22.146 --> 00:24.274
in direct sunlight.

00:27.235 --> 00:28.277
And I had to say it felt good

00:28.402 --> 00:29.696
to have an open relationship.

00:29.862 --> 00:31.447
Not open in a creepy,
polyamorous way,

00:31.572 --> 00:33.909
- just public.
- Oh, no, man, look at that!

00:34.075 --> 00:35.202
Something's going down
at the sanctuary.

00:35.368 --> 00:37.587
Check it out.

00:37.712 --> 00:40.590
Bad news, dudes.

00:40.715 --> 00:43.502
We've been TMZed.

00:43.668 --> 00:45.253
How long has that been recording?

00:45.419 --> 00:46.529
I don't know.

00:46.654 --> 00:49.049
Last time I clocked the security camera,
it was pointed at the football field.

00:49.215 --> 00:51.259
Can you imagine
all the scandalous stuff

00:51.425 --> 00:53.011
that's been caught on tape?

00:56.139 --> 00:57.640
Including my secret relationship

00:57.765 --> 01:00.060
with Matty McKibben.

01:02.893 --> 01:06.223
<font color="#3399FF">Sync and correction by Mlmlte</font>
<font color="#3399FF">www.addic7ed.com</font>

01:06.774 --> 01:08.484
I am barely over my suicide stigma.

01:08.609 --> 01:10.486
I can't be known as the girl
who hooked up on tape.

01:10.611 --> 01:12.288
If you got down and dirt3
in that hellhole,

01:12.413 --> 01:13.789
you have more to worry about
than your image.

01:14.073 --> 01:16.659
The sanctuary is the slutty
vagina of Palos Hills.

01:16.784 --> 01:17.995
Total petri dish.

01:18.252 --> 01:20.288
It is so gonna suck
when you get expelled.

01:20.454 --> 01:21.764
Thanks for piling on my freakout.

01:21.889 --> 01:23.733
Who gives a [bleep] if someone
stole the footage

01:23.858 --> 01:25.301
from the sanctuary?

01:25.426 --> 01:27.637
It's not like it's gonna ruin
your reputation

01:27.762 --> 01:29.005
when it goes viral.

01:29.130 --> 01:31.008
Everybody already knows
you're a slut.

01:31.174 --> 01:32.884
The tape is going <i>public?</i>

01:33.050 --> 01:36.245
No!

01:36.512 --> 01:40.600
Oh, my God...

01:40.841 --> 01:42.118
I hope I at least have a cameo.

01:42.393 --> 01:44.187
From the neck up.

01:44.353 --> 01:45.988
If these happy sacs
are gonna be webified,

01:46.113 --> 01:47.065
I'm gonna need to be compensated.

01:47.231 --> 01:48.257
I won't be on that tape.

01:48.382 --> 01:50.159
Kinda hard to get in trouble

01:50.284 --> 01:52.070
when you're uber-boring
and have no secrets.

01:52.236 --> 01:54.197
It's a good day to be Asian.

01:54.363 --> 01:55.464
But not a good day to be me.

01:55.589 --> 01:57.284
Now I have to tell Jake about Matty

01:57.450 --> 01:58.868
before he finds out the hard way.

01:59.035 --> 02:02.122
I have to get more info
on this footage.

02:02.288 --> 02:03.406
I seriously doubt
they picked up anything

02:03.531 --> 02:05.375
on that sanctuary cam.
It's so dark,

02:05.541 --> 02:06.576
I'm sure all you can see
are shadowy figures.

02:06.701 --> 02:08.127
Probably not faces, right?
No faces?

02:08.294 --> 02:10.547
Yeah, I guess.
I know it's in the past,

02:10.713 --> 02:12.515
and I told Jenna
that it doesn't bother me,

02:12.640 --> 02:15.218
and I don't want it
to bother me, but it kinda does.

02:15.384 --> 02:16.803
Get to the point.
Any point, please.

02:16.969 --> 02:18.138
Jenna told me she's not a virgin.

02:18.304 --> 02:19.806
She's not?

02:19.972 --> 02:21.624
No.

02:21.749 --> 02:23.192
- Did <i>you</i> sleep with her?
- No!

02:23.317 --> 02:26.605
Well, I mean... not yet.
You know.

02:26.771 --> 02:28.620
That has nothing to do with you, man.

02:28.940 --> 02:30.967
That happened before
you two started going out,

02:31.092 --> 02:33.869
so... stop stressing it.

02:33.994 --> 02:35.864
- Remember that girl I lost it to?
- No.

02:36.030 --> 02:37.074
Exactly.
Either do I.

02:38.232 --> 02:39.910
Is that supposed
to make me feel better?

02:40.076 --> 02:41.277
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:41.402 --> 02:44.747
Oh, hey. I gotta go to study gym.

02:44.872 --> 02:48.168
Which is... does exist.

02:48.334 --> 02:50.962
What was that?
Did you tell him about us?

02:51.128 --> 02:53.179
- No, he told <i>me</i> about us.
- What?

02:53.304 --> 02:54.690
He said you slept with somebody,

02:54.815 --> 02:56.559
but for now,
he doesn't know who it is.

02:57.051 --> 02:58.958
- Why'd you tell him?
- That's none of your business.

02:59.083 --> 03:01.130
It is now. That video
could surface any minute.

03:01.255 --> 03:03.032
So we can tell Jake,
or he can find out

03:03.157 --> 03:06.058
with the rest of the world.

03:10.398 --> 03:11.941
Oh, principal Cox.

03:12.066 --> 03:13.902
- Good day.
- No, bad day, Ms. Marks.

03:14.068 --> 03:15.515
If this sanctuary scandal blows up,

03:15.640 --> 03:17.158
- we could all go down.
- I don't want to go down.

03:17.283 --> 03:18.347
I've been there.
One minute,

03:18.472 --> 03:19.871
you're on top of the world, the next,

03:19.996 --> 03:22.164
you're butt-poppin' meth
in an abandoned warehouse

03:22.289 --> 03:23.819
- with a guy named rooster.
- Oh... oh...

03:23.944 --> 03:26.456
I-I need your connections

03:26.622 --> 03:27.874
to help us get this God dang tape.

03:28.040 --> 03:29.325
Mmm,

03:29.450 --> 03:31.227
let me put on
my <i>murder, she wrote</i> glasses

03:31.352 --> 03:33.046
and I will get on it.

03:33.212 --> 03:34.397
Actually,
they're just reading glasses,

03:34.522 --> 03:36.655
but when I lose my keys, I put 'em on

03:37.091 --> 03:38.768
and boom, I instantly find 'em.

03:39.051 --> 03:42.194
'Cause you can actually see.

03:42.513 --> 03:43.890
When you do find that tape,

03:44.465 --> 03:48.210
don't watch it,
just bring it straight to me.

03:48.335 --> 03:51.314
J, like former president Clinton

03:51.439 --> 03:53.191
and former prime minister Tony Blair,

03:53.357 --> 03:54.526
you and I have what some might call

03:54.692 --> 03:56.444
a <i>special</i> relationship.

03:56.610 --> 03:58.213
- Absolutely.
- Okay, ha!

03:58.338 --> 04:01.524
In this scenario, I will be
prime minister Tony Blair,

04:01.649 --> 04:03.426
and you will be Clinton.

04:04.785 --> 04:06.662
Do you know anything about

04:06.787 --> 04:08.290
this alleged sanctuary tape?

04:08.456 --> 04:10.208
Why? Do you?

04:10.374 --> 04:13.920
I asked you first.

04:14.086 --> 04:17.238
No, but I was hoping you had
some inside information

04:17.363 --> 04:19.593
with special friends
would obviously share.

04:19.759 --> 04:21.720
Why do you want to know?

04:21.886 --> 04:22.945
Just curious.

04:23.070 --> 04:25.314
And desperate to know
how much time I had

04:25.598 --> 04:26.683
before I had to tell Jake.

04:26.849 --> 04:28.476
My honeymoon was not ready
to be over.

04:28.642 --> 04:29.885
All right, the truth is
I don't know anything.

04:30.010 --> 04:31.320
I didn't even know
there was a sanctuary

04:31.445 --> 04:33.523
until this morning.

04:33.689 --> 04:35.859
Great.
Well, thanks anyway.

04:36.025 --> 04:37.110
Say hi to the wife for me.

04:37.276 --> 04:38.260
The four of us should get together

04:38.385 --> 04:40.322
for some fondue.

04:40.488 --> 04:42.164
Seriously, j, if you think
of anyone who's in the know,

04:42.289 --> 04:43.491
just send 'em my way.

04:43.657 --> 04:44.900
If there was anyone at P.H.

04:45.025 --> 04:47.787
who knew what was going on
before anyone else, it was...

04:47.953 --> 04:49.171
The <i>Asians?</i>

04:49.296 --> 04:50.498
I'm not eating lunch
with those people!

04:50.664 --> 04:52.876
Ming, you're Chinese.
They're <i>your</i> people!

04:53.042 --> 04:56.129
I am in a code orange
soon-to-be-red situation.

04:56.295 --> 04:58.060
My happiness is at stake.
I need to know if Matty and I

04:58.185 --> 04:59.341
are on that frikkin' tape.

04:59.507 --> 05:01.092
How do the Asians fit
into this equation?

05:01.258 --> 05:04.179
It's no secret, they know
everything about everything.

05:04.345 --> 05:05.555
The Asians brought
their earthquake kits to school

05:05.813 --> 05:07.432
a week before the last earthquake.

05:07.598 --> 05:09.334
And they threw Elena Harvey
a baby shower

05:09.459 --> 05:11.686
before she knew she was knocked up.

05:11.852 --> 05:12.861
Asians aren't magic.

05:12.986 --> 05:15.023
They don't have
to control over everything.

05:15.189 --> 05:16.498
Yes, they do.
Why do you think our school flag

05:16.623 --> 05:20.862
has a dragon on it?

05:21.028 --> 05:23.606
Ming, I'm not asking you
to be friends with them.

05:23.731 --> 05:25.408
It's just one lunch.

05:31.905 --> 05:34.773
♪

05:35.084 --> 05:37.837
- Hi, I'm...
- Ming Wong.

05:38.003 --> 05:39.464
555 Trailriders drive.

05:39.630 --> 05:41.549
- We know you.
- You do?

05:41.715 --> 05:42.801
Your parents own a sundries
shop on the peninsula,

05:42.967 --> 05:44.594
and they're crazy strict.

05:44.760 --> 05:45.728
How do you know that?

05:45.853 --> 05:47.786
The how is not
as important as the why.

05:48.097 --> 05:50.699
Asians make up 30%
of the Palos Verdes population,

05:50.824 --> 05:52.477
so it's important for us
to know everything about them.

05:52.643 --> 05:55.738
What I don't know is
are you a cool Asian

05:55.863 --> 05:57.796
or a school Asian?

05:58.107 --> 05:59.859
- What are your PSAT scores?
- 120.

06:00.025 --> 06:01.736
Low. You're not a school Asian.

06:01.902 --> 06:03.812
Have you ever spring breaked
in Cabo, dealt Adderall,

06:03.937 --> 06:05.247
or had an affair with the lead singer

06:05.372 --> 06:07.182
of an indie rock band?

06:07.450 --> 06:09.452
Not a cool Asian either.

06:09.618 --> 06:11.720
So what am I?

06:11.845 --> 06:13.707
You're white.

06:13.873 --> 06:15.947
- Sushi?
- Wow. Thanks.

06:16.250 --> 06:18.878
Uh, I'm not a real Asian,
so I don't know your name.

06:21.547 --> 06:23.008
Becca.

06:23.174 --> 06:24.923
What can we do for you?

06:25.259 --> 06:27.202
Do you know anyone
that can get their hands

06:27.327 --> 06:28.904
on that sanctuary footage?

06:29.029 --> 06:30.906
My friend needs to know
if she's on it.

06:31.031 --> 06:32.892
We don't stick our necks out
for <i>round eyes.</i>

06:33.058 --> 06:34.866
That's kinda racist.

06:35.227 --> 06:36.813
No, it's not.
Their eyes are round.

06:36.979 --> 06:39.065
Yeah, but...

06:39.231 --> 06:41.067
Now you're a racist.
-, I'm not!

06:41.233 --> 06:43.118
It's cool. Why do you think
I changed my name to Becca

06:43.243 --> 06:45.780
from Wan Fu Win?

06:45.946 --> 06:47.779
Because everyone's a racist.

06:48.157 --> 06:50.618
I'm kidding.

06:57.875 --> 06:59.735
We'll see what we can do
and get back to you.

06:59.860 --> 07:03.340
Until then, here are the answers
to tomorrow's history test.

07:03.506 --> 07:05.296
Oh, my God, this is great.
Thanks.

07:05.591 --> 07:08.343
No, thank you.
You've been making us look bad.

07:16.060 --> 07:19.521
They had Sushi delivered?
<i>A-masian!</i>

07:19.646 --> 07:22.442
You guys, Asians are so cool!

07:22.608 --> 07:23.959
They agreed to investigate
the tape sitch

07:24.084 --> 07:25.653
<i>and</i> slipped me some test answers!

07:25.819 --> 07:27.252
Thanks for the hookup.
If anyone can

07:27.377 --> 07:30.992
smoke out the footage, it'll be them.

07:31.158 --> 07:33.119
I think we lost Ming to the far east.

07:33.285 --> 07:37.506
I feel dirty...
And alive.

07:37.790 --> 07:40.965
I feel Asian!

07:41.252 --> 07:45.799
Kung Pao shrimp, lasagna, and
potato chip chicken casserole.

07:45.965 --> 07:47.217
Those dishes
don't really go together.

07:47.383 --> 07:49.219
Sure, they do.

07:49.385 --> 07:51.142
They are Jenna's favorites.

07:51.428 --> 07:53.488
I guess I know our daughter

07:53.613 --> 07:55.725
a little better than you do.

07:55.891 --> 07:56.892
My mom thought she could work her way

07:57.017 --> 07:58.527
back into my heart
through my stomach.

07:58.652 --> 07:59.528
She didn't know me at all.

07:59.653 --> 08:00.896
What's going on here?

08:01.021 --> 08:03.566
You're cooking,
and you're not eating.

08:03.732 --> 08:05.693
My Matty secret wasn't
the only one I was keeping.

08:05.859 --> 08:07.502
My mom and I were
still harboring her secret

08:07.627 --> 08:08.937
that she wrote the letter,
and I figured

08:09.062 --> 08:11.074
she should be the one to bust it out.

08:11.240 --> 08:15.036
Mom, do you want to tell him?

08:15.202 --> 08:17.001
Why not?

08:17.288 --> 08:22.517
Lacey, what the hell did you do?

08:23.532 --> 08:27.298
Jenna wanted me to tell you that I...

08:28.632 --> 08:31.594
We're both getting perms!

08:36.181 --> 08:39.644
Guess I should have let her tell you.

08:42.062 --> 08:44.105
{pub}When are you going
to tell dad about the letter?

08:44.230 --> 08:47.141
I've tried.

08:47.266 --> 08:49.910
You don't know how hard it is
to tell someone something

08:50.035 --> 08:50.738
that might break their heart.

08:50.904 --> 08:53.214
I knew exactly how hard it was,

08:53.339 --> 08:54.982
which is why I had
conveniently forgotten

08:55.107 --> 08:56.619
to tell Jake about Matty.

08:56.785 --> 08:58.788
What about me?

08:58.954 --> 09:02.023
You broke my heart
when you wrote that letter.

09:02.148 --> 09:04.252
And I still don't know
why you wrote it.

09:04.418 --> 09:07.088
Jenna, I was only trying to help you.

09:07.254 --> 09:09.382
- I swear.
- You are unbelievable.

09:09.548 --> 09:13.011
I'm sorry.
I wish I could take it back.

09:13.177 --> 09:16.681
Not a minute goes by that
I don't regret writing it.

09:16.847 --> 09:20.518
Tell dad about the letter, or I will.

09:20.684 --> 09:24.564
I am done with secrets.

09:24.730 --> 09:26.316
And I wasn't the only one.

09:26.482 --> 09:28.359
The threat of the sanctuary tape
being exposed

09:28.525 --> 09:30.985
ignited a school-wide
pre-emptive strike.

09:31.110 --> 09:33.120
People were spilling
their secrets faster

09:33.405 --> 09:35.825
than a bunch of drunk-ass
reality stars in a hot tub.

09:36.200 --> 09:38.759
I kinda cheated on you
in the sanctuary.

09:38.884 --> 09:41.164
I did the stone 'n bone
with Cici Markling.

09:41.497 --> 09:43.130
I ate a double cheeseburger there.

09:43.255 --> 09:46.252
Best thing I ever put in my mouth!

09:46.627 --> 09:48.402
I made out with Matty McKibben,

09:48.527 --> 09:50.638
and he is a terrible kisser.

09:50.763 --> 09:52.673
It didn't happen
in the sanctuary, though.

09:52.798 --> 09:54.260
I wouldn't go near that cess pit.

09:54.635 --> 09:55.710
As pissed as I was at my mom

09:55.835 --> 09:57.388
for not divulging her secret,

09:57.554 --> 10:00.981
I was just as mad at myself
for holding on to mine.

10:01.266 --> 10:03.317
Ming, you can 86 the tape hunt.

10:03.442 --> 10:04.979
I've decided to tell Jake.

10:05.145 --> 10:06.648
What if it turns out
you're not even on it?

10:06.814 --> 10:09.651
It doesn't matter.
Jake deserves to know.

10:09.817 --> 10:11.225
Even if he hates me for it.

10:11.350 --> 10:14.864
I'll tell Becca
to call off the search.

10:16.115 --> 10:18.422
I don't need the tape anymore.

10:18.742 --> 10:22.492
I'm sorry, but that train
already left the station.

10:22.871 --> 10:24.905
And you can't jump off
of a moving train.

10:25.030 --> 10:28.795
Actually, you can, but then
you might break something!

10:28.961 --> 10:31.589
I'll have that tape
to you by tomorrow.

10:31.755 --> 10:34.515
Ooo-kay.

10:34.800 --> 10:36.010
And thanks again for the cheat sheet.

10:36.176 --> 10:37.818
I'm not complaining, but did you know

10:38.095 --> 10:39.305
a few of those answers are wrong?

10:39.471 --> 10:41.612
I didn't want to "red flag" you.

10:41.974 --> 10:44.325
No one would buy it if you went
from being a "c" student

10:44.450 --> 10:45.728
to full-immersion overnight.

10:45.894 --> 10:49.023
You still only know one language.

10:50.649 --> 10:53.657
Oh...

10:54.027 --> 10:55.870
I'm just saying
I can't imagine some dude

10:55.995 --> 10:57.671
sitting through
a billion hours of footage

10:57.796 --> 10:59.576
just to find a few minutes
of good stuff.

10:59.742 --> 11:01.119
What a pain in the ass.

11:01.285 --> 11:03.663
Are you on it?
Have you been cross-dressing

11:03.829 --> 11:04.598
in the sanctuary?

11:04.723 --> 11:07.292
- Yeah. Can I borrow your thong again?
- As long as you hand-wash it.

11:07.458 --> 11:08.626
You're the one obsessing, Rosati.

11:08.792 --> 11:09.650
I can't help it.

11:09.775 --> 11:10.851
This Jenna thing is bumming me out.

11:10.976 --> 11:11.921
I'm really into her, man.

11:12.728 --> 11:14.340
I just assumed she was a virgin.

11:14.506 --> 11:15.466
You you can't be upset with Jenna

11:15.632 --> 11:16.457
for something she did

11:16.582 --> 11:17.719
- before she met you.
- I know.

11:18.284 --> 11:19.554
But that's not
what's driving me nuts.

11:20.005 --> 11:23.308
It's that Jenna was in love
with this other guy.

11:25.851 --> 11:29.570
How am I supposed
to compete with that?

11:29.695 --> 11:31.232
Is she still in love with him?

11:31.398 --> 11:32.673
I don't know.

11:32.798 --> 11:33.818
Why would you say that?

11:33.984 --> 11:37.155
I'm sorry.

11:37.321 --> 11:39.036
Sorry, I gotta run.

11:39.323 --> 11:41.081
I need to ask you something.

11:41.206 --> 11:43.106
Have you slept with
anyone else besides me?

11:43.452 --> 11:45.663
No, but what I have
or haven't done doesn't...

11:45.829 --> 11:46.664
I love you.

11:50.626 --> 11:51.711
Hey.
Sorry it took so long.

11:51.877 --> 11:53.630
You ready?

11:53.796 --> 11:54.795
I was definitely ready...

11:54.920 --> 11:57.342
To hit the nearest
self-destruct button.

12:02.019 --> 12:02.972
{pub}Do you like this song?

12:04.264 --> 12:06.267
I like this song.
I don't get it, though.

12:06.433 --> 12:08.811
"Her kisses taste like damage."

12:08.977 --> 12:11.704
Is he trying to say that
the girl is emotionally damaged,

12:11.829 --> 12:13.650
or that she tastes like
vodka and cigarettes?

12:15.199 --> 12:17.320
Yeah.

12:17.486 --> 12:20.281
- Jenna, I don't like secrets!
- Secrets? What secrets?

12:20.447 --> 12:23.159
The guy you slept with.

12:23.325 --> 12:25.651
I'm totally jealous of him.
Does that sound crazy?

12:25.776 --> 12:29.288
Yeah, I know, it does.
And I'll own it.

12:29.413 --> 12:31.423
I'm acting like a total whack job,

12:31.548 --> 12:32.825
and I don't even know
who this guy is.

12:32.950 --> 12:34.960
And you know what?

12:35.085 --> 12:37.840
I don't wanna know.

12:38.006 --> 12:41.135
Because you're with me now...

12:41.301 --> 12:44.222
And that's all that matters...
Right?

12:44.461 --> 12:46.557
Okay.

12:46.723 --> 12:51.187
Yeah. There.

12:51.353 --> 12:56.901
Got that out of my system.
Now I can act like a dude again.

12:57.067 --> 12:58.350
You still have to tell him.

12:58.475 --> 13:00.052
He doesn't want to know.

13:00.177 --> 13:01.820
One way or another, [bleep] gets out.

13:01.945 --> 13:03.700
And Matty said he loves you.

13:03.866 --> 13:05.357
Which is totally
[bleep] up, by the way.

13:05.482 --> 13:08.260
How dare he do that now.
What a jerk.

13:08.537 --> 13:10.462
A jerk in love,
which is why he could go rogue.

13:10.587 --> 13:12.631
Look at all the crazy stuff I've done

13:12.756 --> 13:14.600
because of Ricky Schwartz.

13:14.725 --> 13:16.001
The clock is ticking, Jenna,

13:16.126 --> 13:17.630
and according
to Ming's new fr'asians,

13:17.796 --> 13:19.132
wait, friends who are Asians?

13:19.298 --> 13:20.039
Yeah. The footage exists,

13:20.164 --> 13:21.106
and it's coming out today.

13:21.231 --> 13:22.677
<i>Today,</i> Jenna!

13:22.843 --> 13:24.345
This tape is a terrorist's backpack,

13:24.511 --> 13:26.378
and it's entering the open
market of your relationship.

13:26.503 --> 13:28.347
Well, Jake said that
he wasn't interested

13:28.472 --> 13:30.549
in hearing the details
of my former relationship,

13:30.674 --> 13:33.479
and I am going to take that
at face value.

13:33.645 --> 13:34.810
Yeah, well, how is Jake gonna feel

13:34.935 --> 13:37.066
when he finds out
that face belongs to Matty?

13:37.232 --> 13:38.524
You're taking the easy way out.

13:38.649 --> 13:41.727
Maybe. But even if I am
on that footage,

13:41.852 --> 13:44.490
I'm covered.

13:44.656 --> 13:46.200
Jenna Hamilton's not on it.

13:46.366 --> 13:48.953
The security camera was
only turned around for two days.

13:49.119 --> 13:50.747
How did you know
I was getting it for Jenna?

13:50.913 --> 13:52.137
How do I know your
grandparents were born

13:52.262 --> 13:53.505
two Miles outside
of the Jiangsu province,

13:53.790 --> 13:54.709
where they sustained themselves

13:54.875 --> 13:56.441
by running a fish farm?

13:56.566 --> 13:57.628
I just do.

13:57.794 --> 13:59.338
My grandpa said he was an engineer.

13:59.504 --> 14:01.924
Oh. You still want this?

14:02.090 --> 14:04.183
The only thing interesting
is vice principal Highmore

14:04.308 --> 14:06.262
hooking up with some guy
in a fugly snowflake tie.

14:06.428 --> 14:10.892
Gross. I'd still love
to check it out.

14:11.058 --> 14:13.644
And should I ever need a favor?

14:13.810 --> 14:16.528
- Anything.
- Not right now.

14:16.653 --> 14:20.693
But one day in the future,
Ming Fei Yen Huang.

14:22.726 --> 14:23.821
One day.

14:28.325 --> 14:30.509
Jenna, I've got it.

14:30.786 --> 14:32.789
Oh, [bleep] me!

14:32.955 --> 14:35.750
Guess what I got.
Nice tie.

14:35.916 --> 14:37.710
Isn't it a little late
for snowflakes?

14:37.876 --> 14:39.504
You didn't watch that, right,
like I specifically instructed

14:39.670 --> 14:41.153
as your higher-up?

14:41.278 --> 14:45.551
I have seen it,
and it is tres scandalous.

14:45.717 --> 14:47.125
What... what did...
What did you see?

14:47.250 --> 14:48.927
I saw things.
Things that would have made

14:49.052 --> 14:50.431
a lesser woman weep.

14:50.597 --> 14:52.683
Are you familiar with
French new wave cinema?

14:52.849 --> 14:54.199
Look, don't <i>murder, she wrote</i>
me, Marks, all right?

14:54.324 --> 14:55.603
What are you getting at?

14:55.769 --> 14:56.835
There was a lot of shoe leather

14:56.960 --> 14:58.303
to get my hands on this thing,

14:58.428 --> 15:00.566
and I feel I'm due some respect.

15:00.732 --> 15:03.598
Okay, come here.
I'll give you anything you want.

15:03.902 --> 15:06.878
I'm sorry, Becca, the DVD was snaked

15:07.003 --> 15:08.991
by our crazy guidance counselor.

15:09.157 --> 15:11.740
I know.
That was the plan.

15:12.077 --> 15:16.555
I'm confused.
Average student here, remember?

15:16.680 --> 15:18.613
Attention, students, as of today,

15:18.917 --> 15:21.379
vice principal Rachel Highmore
is stepping down,

15:21.545 --> 15:22.494
and guidance counselor Valerie Marks

15:22.619 --> 15:24.162
will be moving into that position.

15:24.287 --> 15:25.633
Kudos, Ms. Marks.

15:25.799 --> 15:27.099
Highmore was trying to stop us

15:27.224 --> 15:29.101
from parking our cars
in the visitor spaces.

15:29.226 --> 15:32.460
That bitch had to go.

15:32.764 --> 15:35.852
You're in our circle of trust
now, Ming Fei Yen Huang.

15:36.018 --> 15:38.938
And that trust can never be broken.

15:39.104 --> 15:43.651
Never... ever.

15:47.009 --> 15:48.698
You're not on the tape.

15:48.864 --> 15:50.366
- Oh, thank God.
- Now you can stop worrying

15:50.532 --> 15:52.724
about yourself
and start worrying about me.

15:52.849 --> 15:55.663
Hello kitty played me
like her sacrificial pawn.

15:55.829 --> 15:58.541
Whenever she got all serious,
she called me by my full name!

15:58.707 --> 16:00.585
It creeped my [bleep] out.

16:00.751 --> 16:02.334
O.M.G.D.F.,

16:02.459 --> 16:04.569
I think you've just been
inducted into the Asian mafia!

16:04.694 --> 16:05.537
What?

16:05.662 --> 16:06.905
As bad as I felt for forcing Ming

16:07.030 --> 16:08.340
to roll with her homies,

16:08.465 --> 16:11.176
I had to admit I felt good.

16:11.301 --> 16:13.145
The black cloud of scandal
had lifted,

16:13.270 --> 16:15.314
and I no longer had to live in fear.

16:15.439 --> 16:19.604
All my business was handled.

16:25.916 --> 16:28.026
I got the tape from Fred Wu,

16:28.151 --> 16:32.617
- and we are...
- Not on it, I know.

16:32.783 --> 16:34.118
Guess I'll see you around.

16:34.284 --> 16:36.120
That's all you have to say?

16:36.286 --> 16:39.571
- What else is there?
- You know.

16:40.123 --> 16:41.373
I was in such a panic over the tape,

16:41.498 --> 16:43.175
I had put Matty's "I love you"
in a box

16:43.300 --> 16:45.610
and shoved it into
a poorly-lit corner of my mind.

16:45.735 --> 16:47.713
So we don't have to tell Jake.

16:47.838 --> 16:49.800
I don't want to be
anyone's secret anymore.

16:49.966 --> 16:51.516
And I don't want
to keep secrets from Jake.

16:51.641 --> 16:54.219
I really like him.
He's not embarrassed of me,

16:54.344 --> 16:56.355
and he never makes me
feel bad about myself.

16:56.640 --> 17:00.659
Did I?

17:00.936 --> 17:03.718
I'm so sorry, Jenna.

17:06.107 --> 17:07.609
Just please don't tell Jake.

17:08.902 --> 17:10.445
I can't lose him too.

17:18.981 --> 17:20.753
{pub}My secrets were still in the closet.

17:20.878 --> 17:22.458
Jake didn't want to ask,

17:22.624 --> 17:23.958
and Matty didn't want me to tell.

17:24.083 --> 17:25.961
And my mom wasn't ready
to out herself either.

17:26.219 --> 17:27.463
So I had to ask myself,

17:27.628 --> 17:30.198
were some secrets better
revealed or concealed?

17:31.800 --> 17:35.262
"It all depends on the secret."

17:35.428 --> 17:41.476
What do you... mean?

17:41.601 --> 17:45.690
"Is it your secret to tell?"

17:47.272 --> 17:49.183
Thanks for dinner.

17:49.308 --> 17:51.612
I made a chocolate silk pie.

17:51.778 --> 17:54.115
Remember that road trip
to Santa Fe when you were eight?

17:54.281 --> 17:56.724
You loved this pie so much
that you begged us

17:56.849 --> 17:58.459
to order one for the road?

17:58.584 --> 18:01.262
And then you secretly ate
the entire thing

18:01.387 --> 18:02.540
and threw up in the cooler.

18:02.706 --> 18:05.084
Mom, stop.
You don't have to keep

18:05.324 --> 18:07.795
bribing me with food.

18:07.961 --> 18:09.755
I'm never gonna tell dad
about the letter.

18:13.925 --> 18:15.845
That's your secret, not mine.

18:16.169 --> 18:20.433
Thank you.

18:22.000 --> 18:28.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

18:37.022 --> 18:39.160
Kevin...

18:42.427 --> 18:44.707
I wrote that letter to Jenna.

18:50.069 --> 18:52.046
I got your text.

18:52.171 --> 18:54.315
But why am I coming
through your back door?

18:54.440 --> 18:56.050
Uh, for the record,

18:56.175 --> 18:58.012
that's the only back door
you'll ever have access to.

18:58.244 --> 18:59.387
Not a problem.

18:59.512 --> 19:00.822
Thanks for bringing it up, though.

19:00.947 --> 19:03.434
I still have P.T.S.D.
from the whole Lissa situation.

19:03.600 --> 19:06.645
D-don't...
Don't say it.

19:06.811 --> 19:10.608
B-hymen.

19:13.443 --> 19:19.241
So, uh, before I sweat
through another shir...

19:19.407 --> 19:21.509
Can you tell me what it was
that was so important

19:21.634 --> 19:23.578
that you had to say it in person?

19:23.703 --> 19:25.413
Do I need to sit down?

19:25.538 --> 19:28.834
I'm gonna probably sit down.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.419
No, I'm gonna stand.

19:32.583 --> 19:33.811
OK, so, Jake...

19:34.547 --> 19:36.190
I know you don't wanna know
about the other guy,

19:36.315 --> 19:38.302
but I want you to know, that is,
if you do want to know.

19:38.468 --> 19:39.227
But I think you would want to know.

19:39.352 --> 19:41.129
What I want...

19:41.254 --> 19:43.554
Is for you to be comfortable
telling me anything.

19:43.974 --> 19:49.237
Even if it's something
you think I don't want to hear.

19:49.362 --> 19:53.574
I want to hear it.

19:53.699 --> 19:56.362
And I think it's only fair
that you know.

19:58.780 --> 20:00.783
I'm not in love
with that other guy anymore.

20:00.949 --> 20:05.663
I am completely and totally
invested in you.

20:05.829 --> 20:10.459
♪ This life could be

20:10.625 --> 20:12.160
♪ great, spent simply...

20:12.285 --> 20:13.684
You taste like pie.

20:14.004 --> 20:18.092
As long as I don't taste like damage.

20:18.258 --> 20:22.221
Well, maybe a little.
