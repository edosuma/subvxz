15:00.524 --> 15:01.358
I… I don't know.

15:01.442 --> 15:05.529
Maybe there's… there's something…
something there, but I'm really not ready.

15:05.613 --> 15:08.365
It seems like you're caught
in an in-between time.

15:09.658 --> 15:12.494
-What?
-Between just friends or…

15:14.038 --> 15:15.247
more than friends?

15:15.331 --> 15:16.665
Between Montana and Matheson.

15:17.958 --> 15:21.378
It's okay. You don't have to tell me.
I know I'm right. [chuckles]

15:22.087 --> 15:25.799
Whoa! On that axis,
your favorite former history teacher.

15:25.883 --> 15:27.676
You mean the one dating my mom?

15:28.260 --> 15:31.388
Wow, that is sufficiently weird.
Oh, hey, Mr. Bennett.

15:31.472 --> 15:34.767
Hey there. It's good
to see you two hanging out again.

15:36.101 --> 15:40.481
Hey, can I interest you in a personal tour
of the historic Matheson Meeting House?

15:40.564 --> 15:43.567
Yeah. See, um, I actually have homework.

15:43.651 --> 15:47.029
It's really good to see you, Mr. Bennett,
outside of school.

15:47.112 --> 15:48.530
Not awkward at all.

15:49.657 --> 15:52.159
-Call me before you leave, all right?
-Mmm.

15:56.413 --> 15:59.124
-[sighs] I'm game.
-You're gonna love it.

16:25.192 --> 16:27.152
He must love you a whole lot.

16:27.236 --> 16:29.863
[Rendell] So what do you think
we're gonna put in these s'mores?

16:29.947 --> 16:31.156
[young Bode] Mmm, marshmallow.

16:31.240 --> 16:33.659
[Rendell] You think a marshmallow?
I think that's a good start.

16:33.742 --> 16:35.869
But you gotta
roast the marshmallow, right?

16:35.953 --> 16:39.206
Can you get in the fire there?
Yeah. What else goes in a s'more?

16:40.165 --> 16:41.792
Chocolate.

16:41.875 --> 16:45.713
How about when it makes
a sandwich, it's a s'more?

16:45.796 --> 16:46.839
[exhales]

16:48.465 --> 16:50.300
It feels like

16:51.260 --> 16:55.139
the wind is almost trying to tickle us.

16:56.015 --> 16:58.976
Kind of like this!

16:59.059 --> 17:00.436
Tickle, tickle!

17:00.519 --> 17:02.104
[Rendell] Whoa, easy. [laughs]

-[door closes]

17:45.898 --> 17:48.525
Hmm, looks like I wasn't the only one
who overslept.

17:49.568 --> 17:51.737
You guys must have been
rushed this morning.

17:51.820 --> 17:53.822
We had to get to school early.

17:55.074 --> 17:56.158
How come?

17:57.159 --> 17:59.745
Getting a bunch of kids
in their costumes takes a minute.

18:00.662 --> 18:03.082
Kins was really good.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.042
Blew 'em all away.

18:06.752 --> 18:08.128
Hey, Kinsey.

18:08.921 --> 18:10.798
I'm so sorry I missed your play.

18:14.384 --> 18:17.054
-Why didn't you wake me? [exhales]
-We tried.

18:19.640 --> 18:20.808
I recorded it.

18:22.142 --> 18:23.352
In case you're interested.

18:30.609 --> 18:34.321
This is where local Matheson rebel
Captain Richard Crais

18:34.404 --> 18:36.532
first engaged the British in battle.

18:37.032 --> 18:39.451
Defeating the 25th Regiment
of the King's Army

18:39.535 --> 18:42.496
in order to secure safe passage
for rebel supplies.

18:43.330 --> 18:45.457
Yes, exactly. How did you know that?

18:45.541 --> 18:46.375
[Tyler] I don't know.

18:46.458 --> 18:50.337
Sometimes weird random facts
about Matheson just come to me.

18:51.713 --> 18:52.631
It's odd.

18:53.173 --> 18:56.135
History has a powerful pull
on a few select people.

18:57.219 --> 18:59.388
Now these uniforms are on loan.

19:00.472 --> 19:01.890
Okay, these are mine.

19:01.974 --> 19:04.143
I remember this one
from your booth at Winter Fest.

19:04.226 --> 19:06.895
Although I feel like
there was some sort of cape involved.

19:06.979 --> 19:08.313
It's a cloak, actually.

19:08.397 --> 19:11.066
I keep that at home.
Wear it around the house.

19:11.608 --> 19:13.193
Makes me feel like a badass.

19:14.027 --> 19:14.903
I--

19:15.404 --> 19:19.783
I… I feel like I've actually seen this
somewhere before. What does it mean?

19:19.867 --> 19:22.286
Well, the silver and gold plates
were reserved for captains.

19:22.369 --> 19:24.288
They had elaborate designs on them.

19:24.872 --> 19:27.499
Not a lot of these still in existence.

19:27.583 --> 19:30.043
-[sinister music playing]
-[whooshing]

19:31.128 --> 19:32.129
That guy.

19:33.839 --> 19:37.634
One of the guys who broke into our house,
he was… he was wearing one just like this.

19:37.718 --> 19:39.678
Wait, someone broke into your house?

19:41.221 --> 19:44.433
Yeah, the… the night
that Duncan's wedding was,

19:44.516 --> 19:45.642
when everyone was outside.

19:45.726 --> 19:47.561
I'm sorry. Your mom didn't tell me that.

19:48.312 --> 19:49.479
Uh, they didn't take anything,

19:49.563 --> 19:52.733
but why would
that guy be wearing this buckle?

19:53.942 --> 19:55.068
I have no clue.

20:01.408 --> 20:03.410
[bubbling]

20:08.624 --> 20:10.500
Hey. Is Tyler back yet?

20:11.418 --> 20:12.502
Oh, um,

20:13.670 --> 20:14.588
I don't know.

20:14.671 --> 20:16.840
I didn't realize he was gone.

20:20.427 --> 20:21.720
What have you been up to?

20:22.304 --> 20:24.473
I was with the Savinis.
[sighs] They just left.

20:25.182 --> 20:26.391
More movie stuff?

20:27.184 --> 20:28.268
Actually, no.

20:30.103 --> 20:31.021
[can hisses open]

20:31.939 --> 20:33.815
We had to take care of something.

-You might think it's weird.

20:36.610 --> 20:38.070
To be fair, it was, but…

20:38.153 --> 20:39.529
[inhales deeply]

20:39.613 --> 20:41.365
…it was also kind of beautiful.

20:41.448 --> 20:43.283
You mind telling me about it later?

20:43.992 --> 20:47.412
I… have some work to do upstairs.

20:48.747 --> 20:49.998
Oh. Sure.

20:51.333 --> 20:52.417
You okay?

20:53.752 --> 20:54.753
Yeah.

20:55.629 --> 20:57.089
Yeah, I'm… I'm fine.

21:06.431 --> 21:08.433
[mysterious music playing]

21:10.477 --> 21:12.479
[footsteps echoing]

21:17.067 --> 21:18.777
[Josh] It's remarkable, isn't it?

21:23.573 --> 21:25.117
It's a slab of wood.

21:25.742 --> 21:28.412
Yes, that's accurate.

21:29.121 --> 21:31.331
I was referring to how well
it's been preserved

21:31.415 --> 21:33.458
from the last 200-plus years.

21:35.627 --> 21:37.546
Is there something I can help you with?

21:37.629 --> 21:41.258
Is there something I can say
to get you to stop doing that?

21:41.341 --> 21:43.093
There used to be a compartment here.

21:43.176 --> 21:44.970
Yes, there was a compartment there.

21:45.053 --> 21:48.015
It was taken out
during a rebuilding of the house

21:48.098 --> 21:49.182
in the 1800s.

21:53.270 --> 21:56.940
What has happened
to the possessions inside?

21:58.108 --> 21:59.609
Uh, well, there were some.

22:00.485 --> 22:01.987
Firearms, mostly.

22:02.070 --> 22:05.115
Fortunately, they were recovered
and now on display in our library.

22:05.198 --> 22:07.200
Hmm. [chuckles]

22:07.909 --> 22:09.328
That is fortunate.

22:13.832 --> 22:15.584
[Josh] Have you been here before?

22:16.501 --> 22:17.878
A long time ago.

22:26.678 --> 22:29.056
Mom? You up here?

[suspenseful music playing]

22:42.986 --> 22:43.862
Yeah.

22:43.945 --> 22:44.863
Hey.

22:45.489 --> 22:48.116
You seemed a little distracted earlier.

22:48.742 --> 22:51.661
No, I'm just, um… [chuckles] working.

22:52.329 --> 22:54.373
You know, in it.

22:55.290 --> 22:57.709
-Maybe I can help.
-I'd like some privacy.

23:19.648 --> 23:21.400
We spare no one.

would you?

filed a police report the other night.

26:17.993 --> 26:20.120
Uh, our uncle was getting married
up at our house,

26:20.203 --> 26:22.414

some guys broke in.

scared them away. What's the name?
