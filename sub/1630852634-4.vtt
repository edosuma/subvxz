00:09.375 --> 00:12.375
[ominous music]

00:15.083 --> 00:16.250
[swooshes]

00:17.333 --> 00:18.166
Goddess.

00:23.666 --> 00:27.083
Luna, your fear calls to me.

00:27.166 --> 00:29.208
Only my rage, Goddess.

00:29.291 --> 00:31.083
The lotuses are gone.

00:31.166 --> 00:33.666
You are afraid of a story.

00:33.750 --> 00:34.916
It makes you angry.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.666
But if it is more than a story…

00:37.750 --> 00:39.500
A prophecy.

00:39.583 --> 00:41.583
I was there, Luna.

00:41.666 --> 00:45.625
History becomes myth
as it is retold time and again.

00:45.708 --> 00:48.625
Meaning given to events that had none.

00:48.708 --> 00:52.083
Promises from fathers of failure
become prophecy.

00:52.166 --> 00:56.083
All born of bedtime stories for children.

00:56.166 --> 00:59.041
Princess Mirana was exiled
for her failure.

00:59.125 --> 01:01.958
I have come home
from my search empty-handed.

01:02.041 --> 01:05.125
[Selemene] Mirana was not exiled.
She made a choice.

01:06.083 --> 01:09.250
Her journey is not your own.

01:11.666 --> 01:14.791
The theft of the lotuses is a grave crime.

01:14.875 --> 01:16.875
It cost us a great deal.

01:17.375 --> 01:21.375
But you should have faith.

01:31.333 --> 01:35.083
[theme music]

02:20.166 --> 02:22.250
[wind swooshing]

02:22.333 --> 02:23.500
[groans]

02:24.333 --> 02:26.916
[dramatic music]

02:36.125 --> 02:37.041
[exhales]

02:39.833 --> 02:42.583
Ugh, at last.
It's good to be out of the wind.

02:42.666 --> 02:43.625
Your arm.

02:44.708 --> 02:45.916
Didn't notice.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.333
Let me wrap that.

02:47.416 --> 02:50.458
There's a stable with horse rugs
that should fit Sagan.

02:54.375 --> 02:56.916
[Davion chuckles]
There we are.

02:59.291 --> 03:02.125
[gulping]

03:02.208 --> 03:03.958
[sighs, chuckles]

03:04.500 --> 03:06.250
Dragon's Fire Whiskey.

03:06.333 --> 03:08.750
It's no Icewrack White,
but it'll warm you up.

03:11.375 --> 03:12.541
[coughs]

03:12.625 --> 03:14.958
[Davion] Yeah,
that's why they call it Dragon's Fire.

03:15.833 --> 03:17.208
I surmised.

03:17.291 --> 03:24.166
Listen. If you, uh, you know, talk,
uh, I'm here.

03:27.166 --> 03:30.541
Nice hot meal. Sleep.
You'll be ready to go in no time.

03:31.250 --> 03:32.291
No time at all.

03:32.375 --> 03:34.875
[door squeaks open]

03:36.541 --> 03:37.375
Company.

03:37.458 --> 03:40.458
[suspenseful music]

03:44.500 --> 03:46.041
Kaden.

03:46.125 --> 03:48.625
You found that here. In the cold.

03:48.708 --> 03:51.333
Crimson and gold are acting strange.

03:51.416 --> 03:53.833
Easier to hunt, harder to kill.

03:53.916 --> 03:55.916
You don't make it look hard.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.833
The armor.
Every piece, forged from dragon.

03:59.916 --> 04:03.708
The older the better.
Adult. I took his strength.

04:03.791 --> 04:05.375
Adult?

04:05.458 --> 04:08.125
An adult must have taken half the order
to bring down.

04:08.208 --> 04:09.041
Hm.

04:09.583 --> 04:10.958
Only me.

04:11.666 --> 04:12.833
[thuds]

04:13.833 --> 04:17.750
Didn't expect to see anyone here.
Guessing you heard from Bram, my squire.

04:17.833 --> 04:19.250
Sent him to Dragon Hold.

04:19.333 --> 04:20.916
[Kaden] Sent from where?

04:21.000 --> 04:23.541
Barrowhaven. Clearing a wyrmling nest.

04:23.625 --> 04:25.125
Thought I found an Eldwyrm.

04:25.208 --> 04:28.041
Did you think or did you find?

04:29.125 --> 04:32.083
We… No. We didn't find it.

04:33.041 --> 04:35.041
The lady doesn't approve.

04:35.125 --> 04:36.333
I'm sorry?

04:36.416 --> 04:38.708
I know the face. The look.

04:38.791 --> 04:42.250
Thinking, "This poor animal."

04:42.333 --> 04:44.833
Do you know what he would do to you
in the wild?

04:44.916 --> 04:48.666
His bite melts flesh.
Cooks the blood in your veins.

04:48.750 --> 04:53.458
Keeps you alive and screaming.
Strong men beg for death.

04:54.083 --> 04:56.250
A Dragon Knight honors his enemy.

04:57.708 --> 04:59.875
But we can never forget what they are.

05:01.250 --> 05:02.958
Killing machines.

05:05.125 --> 05:08.041
I, uh… I'm going to check on Marci.

05:09.833 --> 05:10.750
[door closes]

05:13.125 --> 05:14.125
Davion, wait!

05:14.208 --> 05:15.041
Not now.

05:15.666 --> 05:17.000
You lied to him.

05:17.083 --> 05:18.916
It's worse than that.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.375
I wanted to fight him.

05:20.458 --> 05:21.541
Fight him?

05:21.625 --> 05:23.083
It's crazy, I know.

05:23.166 --> 05:26.083
Something about seeing him
with that wyrmling in his hands.

05:26.166 --> 05:27.500
On that hook.

05:29.750 --> 05:33.416
You wanted to go back to Dragon Hold
to speak with someone exactly like him.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.208
This is your chance.

05:35.291 --> 05:36.708
He wouldn't understand any of this.

05:36.791 --> 05:39.000
You mean you're afraid he won't.

05:39.083 --> 05:43.458
Hm, I thought Davion the Dragon Knight
wasn't afraid of anything.

05:45.333 --> 05:48.750
[eerie music]

05:54.708 --> 05:57.875
How old were you when you learned
to step from shadow to shadow?

05:57.958 --> 05:58.916
Childhood's end.

05:59.625 --> 06:03.333
Hm. Any variations in the power
of this ability?

06:03.416 --> 06:04.375
Night.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.041
Full moons.

06:07.333 --> 06:08.750
With my family.

06:09.791 --> 06:12.250
Interesting. Do the seasons…

06:12.333 --> 06:14.166
Knowing this will help bring Mene back.

06:14.250 --> 06:16.875
Are you always so emotional?

06:17.958 --> 06:19.333
I had a dream last night.

06:20.958 --> 06:22.666
Would you like to write that down?

06:24.333 --> 06:26.375
-Tell me.
-It was dark.

06:26.458 --> 06:28.708
I heard Mene's name over and over.

06:28.791 --> 06:33.583
My pod. My family. We worshiped. We loved.

06:34.083 --> 06:35.791
I saw their faces.

06:36.583 --> 06:38.375
Dyfed, Idwal, Adara.

06:39.125 --> 06:40.083
They smiled.

06:41.041 --> 06:42.041
Then I woke.

06:43.500 --> 06:45.458
Alone in a tower.

06:45.541 --> 06:49.750
All these books. All this magic.
You understand nothing.

06:56.708 --> 06:58.333
What am I supposed to do with this?

06:58.416 --> 07:00.166
Understand everything.

07:07.833 --> 07:10.375
Is it the food or the company?

07:11.291 --> 07:13.666
-I'm sorry?
-[Kaden] You're not eating.

07:14.333 --> 07:17.041
It was a difficult trip up the mountain.

07:19.666 --> 07:22.291
[Kaden] For you, then. Dragon scale tips.

07:22.375 --> 07:24.166
These should ease the trip down.

07:25.208 --> 07:26.208
Thank you.

07:27.958 --> 07:32.166
I imagine you didn't come
all the way out here to hunt wyrmlings.

07:32.250 --> 07:35.416
Settling a debt. My dragon debt.

07:35.500 --> 07:36.958
Dragon debt?

07:37.041 --> 07:38.583
A debt with dragons.

07:38.666 --> 07:41.083
Not dragons. Men.

07:42.875 --> 07:44.875
[Kaden] It was almost 20 years ago.

07:45.625 --> 07:47.833
Thirty of us to the city of Leathsham.

07:48.666 --> 07:52.208
Nice town. Wyrmling sightings.

07:52.791 --> 07:57.500
Feared it might mean an adult dragon,
we weren't taking any chances.

07:58.375 --> 08:01.333
Kept a journal then,
was worried about a girl.

08:01.416 --> 08:03.291
Or some nonsense.

08:04.125 --> 08:10.083
Then the sky tore open.
A streak of fire. Looked like day.

08:10.833 --> 08:12.708
Looked like hell.

08:12.791 --> 08:15.875
Worries over girls
were lost in that flame.

08:15.958 --> 08:18.708
Bravery and training marched us forward,

08:18.791 --> 08:20.500
into the maw of death.

08:24.125 --> 08:29.000
We didn't know, couldn't know
until we saw him

08:29.083 --> 08:30.291
in the light of his own fire.

08:31.041 --> 08:33.583
Red scales shifted in the moonlight.

08:33.666 --> 08:35.708
The size of him.

08:35.791 --> 08:38.291
Couldn't understand it, how he could move.

08:38.375 --> 08:40.666
Then his mouth opened.

08:45.250 --> 08:46.666
Pain came out of it.

08:46.750 --> 08:50.125
[dramatic music]

08:58.875 --> 09:00.666
Death came out of it.

09:01.166 --> 09:03.416
Smoke from burning flesh fogged the air.

09:04.125 --> 09:05.958
Felt the captain's hand on my leg.

09:06.041 --> 09:07.291
I stumbled backward,

09:07.375 --> 09:11.500
and I saw nothing left of him
from below the chest.

09:11.583 --> 09:15.208
The man had taught me to fight,
just pulp now.

09:15.291 --> 09:17.583
Thirty men rode to Leathsham.

09:18.583 --> 09:19.916
One rode back.

09:21.250 --> 09:23.375
I rode back.

09:24.875 --> 09:28.875
So, yes. I'm hunting something larger
than wyrmlings.

09:29.583 --> 09:32.458
I'm hunting Slyrak.

09:32.541 --> 09:36.000
After nearly 20 years,
I finally found his lair.

09:36.750 --> 09:38.875
It was empty. The beast was gone.

09:39.625 --> 09:41.916
I followed his trail through the earth.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.125
Took me to a mountain
outside of Barrowhaven.

09:45.708 --> 09:47.041
Nice town.

09:48.083 --> 09:53.458
Didn't find Slyrak.
Found a dead dragon. Found a dead man.

09:53.541 --> 09:57.583
And I found this. Yours.

09:57.666 --> 10:01.500
You went down into that cave,
and you weren't prepared for what you saw.

10:01.583 --> 10:04.208
You ran, and you are ashamed.

10:05.166 --> 10:06.291
Don't be.

10:07.333 --> 10:09.458
I've seen up close
what just one Eldwyrm can do

10:09.541 --> 10:11.541
to an entire company of Dragon Knights.

10:11.625 --> 10:16.666
One man, one unprepared man,
has no hope of victory.

10:18.875 --> 10:23.958
But to kill Slyrak,
I need to know what you saw.

10:28.541 --> 10:33.750
When I woke up, I was naked.
Everything was gone. Even this.

10:33.833 --> 10:36.750
That's all I can remember.
I need your help.

10:36.833 --> 10:39.083
We made a sacred oath.

10:39.166 --> 10:40.541
Dragon Knights.

10:40.625 --> 10:43.250
Brothers. You will have my help.

10:44.166 --> 10:45.416
I promise.

10:48.125 --> 10:51.333
[Mirana] I knew he would help you.
You're in good hands.

10:51.416 --> 10:53.375
I've been in good hands.

10:53.458 --> 10:54.625
We both have.

10:56.041 --> 10:58.500
Still have that whiskey?
We should celebrate.

10:58.583 --> 11:02.416
I suppose I do.
And I suppose you're right.

11:02.500 --> 11:06.333
Damn right, I'm right.
Besides, big day tomorrow.

11:06.416 --> 11:10.791
Killing dragons, possibly being a dragon
and getting killed.

11:10.875 --> 11:12.333
So, let's drink.

11:13.375 --> 11:15.916
-What?
-So that's what this is all about?

11:16.000 --> 11:17.833
Uh, not following.

11:17.916 --> 11:20.541
The smile. The drink.

11:20.625 --> 11:22.875
You and me. Covering.

11:22.958 --> 11:25.333
You're being "Davion
the fucking Dragon Knight

11:25.416 --> 11:26.875
what killed the fucking dragon."

11:26.958 --> 11:27.958
Stop it.

11:28.041 --> 11:29.458
I am Davion the…

11:29.541 --> 11:31.833
Stop. Take off the armor.

11:31.916 --> 11:33.541
It's all right to be human.

11:33.625 --> 11:35.625
I'm human all the time.

11:35.708 --> 11:37.375
See? Human.

11:37.458 --> 11:41.166
Right. You know, let's just not.

11:42.833 --> 11:44.333
Tell me what you want me to say.

11:46.083 --> 11:47.666
Start with what I can see.

11:47.750 --> 11:50.083
You're not eating.
You're confused. A wreck.

11:50.166 --> 11:53.291
You're on home ground with your hero,
and you should feel safe.

11:53.375 --> 11:55.375
You should feel better.
But you feel worse.

11:55.458 --> 11:56.791
So you hide.

11:56.875 --> 11:58.833
[scoffs]
You, Princess Mirana,

11:58.916 --> 12:01.250
are gonna lecture me about hiding.

12:04.458 --> 12:08.250
Every night when I go to sleep
and every morning when I wake,

12:08.333 --> 12:09.416
I wonder who I am.

12:10.041 --> 12:13.958
I used to know.
I used to make sense. I was…

12:15.041 --> 12:17.833
[heavy breathing]

12:17.916 --> 12:19.041
No.

12:19.791 --> 12:22.708
The cave. I saw horrors.

12:22.791 --> 12:25.791
Worshiping a strange red rock.

12:25.875 --> 12:27.541
Otherworldly.

12:28.541 --> 12:31.625
Powerful. I felt it. Heard it.

12:31.708 --> 12:35.291
Promising to fill the hole in me.
It was madness.

12:37.041 --> 12:38.958
But it was also an answer.

12:39.041 --> 12:42.250
And I was ready to let it be the answer.

12:42.333 --> 12:46.500
Then I realized.
It was just a place to hide.

12:47.541 --> 12:50.625
And now, I want a drink. Company.

12:51.458 --> 12:54.208
And a better answer than madness.

12:54.291 --> 12:57.791
I'm not a better answer.
I'm not even a different answer.

13:02.375 --> 13:05.000
You don't get to decide that for me.

13:07.666 --> 13:11.458
Sleep well, Dragon Knight.
I'll see you when you wake.

13:16.708 --> 13:19.708
[eerie music]

13:22.208 --> 13:24.958
[tinkling]

13:25.041 --> 13:26.791
Selemene.

13:32.166 --> 13:35.166
[dreamy music]

13:42.458 --> 13:44.291
Crescent light upon you.

13:44.916 --> 13:46.958
[girl] May your moon always be full.

13:49.125 --> 13:50.583
Do you love me?

13:50.666 --> 13:53.500
You are the light
that shines behind my eyes.

13:53.583 --> 13:55.750
Mm, worship me.

13:55.833 --> 13:57.666
No one will worship you more.

13:58.208 --> 14:00.000
[breathes deeply]

14:00.083 --> 14:02.125
Do you love me?

14:02.791 --> 14:04.166
[gasps]

14:04.250 --> 14:07.125
Save me! Please, Goddess!

14:07.208 --> 14:09.958
Do you love me?

14:10.583 --> 14:12.333
Goddess, please!

14:12.416 --> 14:14.458
[pants]
I love you!

14:14.541 --> 14:15.791
Please!

14:15.875 --> 14:17.500
[screams]

14:23.041 --> 14:26.041
[dreamy music]

14:30.291 --> 14:35.625
A thousand years and these people
still don't know who you really are.

14:36.791 --> 14:40.708
Her soul has already returned
to the Material Plane.

14:40.791 --> 14:44.166
She will have no memory of this
and know only renewed,

14:44.250 --> 14:45.875
intense love for me.

14:45.958 --> 14:47.666
I don't see the harm.

14:47.750 --> 14:49.000
You never do.

14:49.083 --> 14:51.166
I know you have the lotuses.

14:51.250 --> 14:53.666
I know that's how you came to be here.

14:55.166 --> 14:58.541
What I don't know is why.

14:59.541 --> 15:03.583
To end this. You can have the lotuses.

15:03.666 --> 15:05.583
I only want one thing.

15:05.666 --> 15:06.666
Anything.

15:07.208 --> 15:09.541
[Invoker] To let the past be the past.

15:09.625 --> 15:11.458
To forgive you.

15:11.541 --> 15:13.458
To say goodbye.

15:13.541 --> 15:14.750
Say goodbye?

15:14.833 --> 15:17.125
To whom would I say goodbye?

15:17.208 --> 15:19.041
You don't even have a name anymore.

15:19.125 --> 15:21.541
What cannot be named, cannot be known.

15:21.625 --> 15:24.708
What cannot be known, cannot be harmed.

15:24.791 --> 15:25.791
Or loved.

15:27.083 --> 15:28.625
A shame.

15:28.708 --> 15:33.583
Not to know the only being
who ever saw me for who I truly am.

15:33.666 --> 15:35.291
I loved you once.

15:35.958 --> 15:36.791
Once.

15:36.875 --> 15:38.791
I could love you again.

15:38.875 --> 15:42.041
[sighs]
Selemene. That's not…

15:43.416 --> 15:44.708
Do you love me?

15:46.750 --> 15:47.708
[groans]

15:47.791 --> 15:48.916
Nothing…

15:49.625 --> 15:51.125
[groaning]

15:51.208 --> 15:52.250
[Slyrak] Nothing.

15:52.333 --> 15:55.416
[groaning]

15:58.083 --> 16:00.875
[chokes]

16:06.541 --> 16:08.333
[Davion] I am nothing.

16:11.833 --> 16:14.833
[gasping]

16:19.958 --> 16:20.833
Kaden?

16:21.916 --> 16:24.000
[Davion grunting]

16:29.750 --> 16:31.166
[Mirana] Davion?

16:31.833 --> 16:32.750
Davion!

16:32.833 --> 16:34.708
[rattling]

16:34.791 --> 16:37.250
[ominous music]

16:42.125 --> 16:44.916
Kaden! What the hell are you doing?

16:46.458 --> 16:47.458
Kaden!

16:55.625 --> 16:56.458
[Davion] Kaden?

16:57.166 --> 16:58.375
[grunts]

16:58.458 --> 17:01.250
Ionic dragon. They can't lie.

17:01.333 --> 17:02.791
Now you can't either.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.166
Where are you?

17:05.875 --> 17:07.083
Show yourself.

17:07.166 --> 17:08.500
I don't understand!

17:08.583 --> 17:10.958
Not you, brother. Him.

17:11.041 --> 17:12.291
Slyrak.

17:12.375 --> 17:14.916
He's gone! He's dead!

17:15.000 --> 17:16.333
He's not!
[grunts]

17:16.416 --> 17:17.708
[yells]

17:20.458 --> 17:21.583
[grunting]

17:21.666 --> 17:25.000
Where are you, coward?

17:25.083 --> 17:26.166
[groaning]

17:28.791 --> 17:31.583
[growling]

17:34.208 --> 17:35.208
Here.

17:38.833 --> 17:41.916
-[Kaden] Hiding in this boy.
-[Slyvion] Traveling.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.625
Traveling where? Tell me.

17:44.708 --> 17:48.375
Little mouse. Smells of fear.

17:48.458 --> 17:52.541
I watch mountains drown in oceans.

17:52.625 --> 17:55.583
Where I go, no man can travel.

17:55.666 --> 17:58.916
Come out and follow me to your death.

17:59.000 --> 18:03.333
You seek my destruction.
Your vengeance will not be quenched,

18:03.416 --> 18:08.916
nor will your glory be sung through time
for there will be no one to sing it.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.333
Once released from corporal fetters,

18:12.416 --> 18:16.583
time, space, the Manifold Forms,

18:16.666 --> 18:20.125
the pillars of order and chaos dissolve.

18:20.208 --> 18:24.125
What awaits the endless universes
is a destruction

18:24.208 --> 18:27.291
with no hope of regeneration.

18:27.375 --> 18:32.500
Absence of nothing.
You know not what you are up against.

18:32.583 --> 18:36.625
Twenty years preparing for this. For you.

18:36.708 --> 18:40.958
Empires burn beneath my breath,
little mouse.

18:41.041 --> 18:43.375
Armies become ashes.

18:43.458 --> 18:46.166
An army against you dies screaming.

18:46.250 --> 18:49.958
I don't need an army or a dragon adult.

18:50.041 --> 18:52.291
The bigger you are, the harder it hits.

18:52.375 --> 18:54.666
I remember you.

18:54.750 --> 18:58.375
I remember what your friends tasted like.

18:58.458 --> 19:02.666
I remember the smell of their fear.

19:02.750 --> 19:09.041
Lucky little mouse ran away,
and that's the truth.

19:12.000 --> 19:12.833
[grunts]

19:14.125 --> 19:16.000
I remember the smell too.

19:17.083 --> 19:21.125
Can't forget. Won't. I'm out of questions.

19:21.791 --> 19:23.166
[growls]

19:23.250 --> 19:26.166
Twenty fucking years.

19:26.250 --> 19:28.083
Nothing to me.

19:29.041 --> 19:30.333
[snarls]

19:43.375 --> 19:44.458
[yells]

19:47.041 --> 19:50.166
Twenty fucking years and 29 fucking souls.

19:50.250 --> 19:52.541
You think I'm not prepared for this?

19:54.666 --> 19:57.250
You can't hit a Chaos dragon either.

19:59.500 --> 20:00.666
[growls]

20:06.500 --> 20:07.458
[grunts]

20:12.250 --> 20:15.250
[growling]

20:16.458 --> 20:17.750
Goddess.

20:17.833 --> 20:20.500
There you are, you son of a bitch.

20:30.250 --> 20:32.000
Marci! Sagan!

20:32.875 --> 20:36.458
[suspenseful music]

20:42.291 --> 20:43.666
[screams]

20:55.833 --> 20:57.791
[snarls]

21:19.833 --> 21:20.833
[growls]

21:35.958 --> 21:37.750
He's gone.

21:37.833 --> 21:40.833
[somber music]

21:40.916 --> 21:42.333
[growling]

21:43.750 --> 21:46.750
[dramatic music]

21:58.791 --> 22:01.166
[Invoker] How did it all go so wrong?

22:01.250 --> 22:02.541
You abandoned me.

22:02.625 --> 22:03.500
Hm.

22:04.750 --> 22:06.166
I abandoned you.

22:06.250 --> 22:08.250
But I am a gracious goddess.

22:08.791 --> 22:09.833
I forgive you.

22:11.291 --> 22:12.666
[Invoker] And her?

22:13.750 --> 22:15.583
Do you forgive her?

22:15.666 --> 22:16.666
Don't.

22:16.750 --> 22:19.500
I watched, helplessly.

22:19.583 --> 22:23.833
As a child, our child wilted away.

22:23.916 --> 22:25.750
Please. It is done.

22:26.666 --> 22:27.791
Come back to me.

22:27.875 --> 22:31.583
Say her name. And I am yours.

22:32.333 --> 22:33.625
She was your daughter.

22:34.708 --> 22:35.875
Gone.

22:36.500 --> 22:39.458
All of your forgotten children hate you.

22:39.541 --> 22:41.833
The elves rise.

22:41.916 --> 22:47.250
A secret army, an Elven Legion,
emerging from every enclave in the world.

22:47.333 --> 22:50.166
And I have the lotuses.

22:50.250 --> 22:53.083
You can't.

22:53.833 --> 22:55.250
You wouldn't.

22:55.333 --> 22:57.916
You wouldn't save her.

22:58.875 --> 23:00.875
And you can't save yourself.

23:00.958 --> 23:02.208
[yells]

23:05.416 --> 23:08.791
[panting]

23:13.625 --> 23:17.791
The girl. What happened to her?
What happened to…

23:18.958 --> 23:19.958
Is it true?

23:31.500 --> 23:32.708
[gasps]

23:32.791 --> 23:33.666
Goddess.

23:33.750 --> 23:36.583
I showed them mercy for a thousand years!

23:36.666 --> 23:38.000
Gave them peace!

23:38.083 --> 23:42.375
In exchange, they allow dissension
and malice to fester within their ranks!

23:42.458 --> 23:47.916
I could be everything to them,
and yet they choose eternal nothing!

23:48.000 --> 23:50.625
-Who?
-The elves! The enclaves!

23:50.708 --> 23:53.500
A waking dream
of their Dark Moon Apocalypse!

23:53.583 --> 23:54.958
You said it was just a story.

23:55.041 --> 23:58.458
Their intentions are real,
and now so is the threat.

23:59.458 --> 24:03.458
Moonlight has shined down on them
for so long

24:03.541 --> 24:06.916
they have forgotten it is mine to give.

24:07.625 --> 24:13.000
You will be my searing reminder.
Take the Dark Moon Order.

24:13.958 --> 24:17.875
Burn out the impurities
that survive inside the enclaves.

24:17.958 --> 24:21.000
Return them to my embrace.

24:21.083 --> 24:23.166
The Order has not left
the Nightsilver Woods

24:23.250 --> 24:25.083
for a thousand years.

24:25.166 --> 24:29.166
And it leaves for the same purpose
as it did then.

24:29.833 --> 24:33.250
The Goddess of the Moon is going to war.

24:38.250 --> 24:41.250
[closing theme music]
