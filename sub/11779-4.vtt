EPISODE OF <i> INK MASTER,</i>

00:03.836 --> 00:06.297
15 ARTISTS WERE LEFT
IN THE COMPETITION.

00:06.381 --> 00:12.345
- FIVE ARTISTS WILL TATTOO
EACH TWIN AT THE SAME TIME.

00:12.429 --> 00:14.347

- WHOO!

00:14.431 --> 00:14.764
narrator: IN THE FLASH
CHALLENGE...

00:14.848 --> 00:17.267
- OH, [bleep].

00:17.350 --> 00:19.811
narrator: HOT TWINS ENDURED
TATTOO TORTURE.

00:19.894 --> 00:22.230
- HOW MUCH CRAZIER CAN YOU GET?

00:22.313 --> 00:23.857
narrator:
IN THE ELIMINATION TATTOO...

00:23.940 --> 00:25.066
- DAMN!

00:25.150 --> 00:26.693
narrator: GEOMETRIC DESIGN
STUMPED THE ARTISTS.

00:26.776 --> 00:28.027
- I WANT METATRON'S CUBE.

00:28.111 --> 00:31.698
- METRA-? SPECTA-?
WHO KNOWS WHAT THAT IS?

00:31.781 --> 00:33.616
- MY BACK'S STARTING TO KILL ME.

00:33.700 --> 00:37.245
narrator: A SEVERE INJURY
SENT DAVID TO THE E.R.

00:37.328 --> 00:38.788
- I GOT TO STAY IN THIS GAME.
[grunts]

00:38.872 --> 00:39.956
I GOT TO NUT UP.
[bleep], THAT HURTS.

00:40.039 --> 00:44.335
- THE BEST TATTOO OF THE DAY
GOES TO SAUSAGE.

00:44.419 --> 00:47.213
YOU NOW HAVE THE POWER TO PUT
THE ARTIST THAT YOU THINK

00:47.297 --> 00:50.049
HAS THE WORST TATTOO
UP FOR ELIMINATION.

00:50.133 --> 00:52.093
- ROLAND.
- I DID A GOOD TATTOO.

00:52.177 --> 00:53.094
IT'S BULL[bleep].

00:53.178 --> 00:54.429
narrator: IN THE ELIMINATION,

00:54.512 --> 00:58.349
DAVID, BUBBA, AND ROLAND
WERE THE BOTTOM THREE.

00:58.433 --> 01:00.769
- BUBBA.
- THERE IS NO STRAIGHT OUTLINE.

01:00.852 --> 01:01.853
NO SOLID COLOR.

01:01.936 --> 01:04.147
YOU'RE HANGING YOURSELF HERE.
- DAVID.

01:04.230 --> 01:05.397
- PAIN CLOUDS THE JUDGMENT.

01:05.482 --> 01:07.108
BUT YOU HAVE
THE MOST EXPERIENCE,

01:07.192 --> 01:09.194
AND THAT MAKES IT UNFORGIVABLE.

01:09.277 --> 01:12.447
- ROLAND, SAUSAGE PUT YOU UP
FOR ELIMINATION.

01:12.530 --> 01:13.907
- HE'S DOWN HERE BECAUSE
OF HIS BODY OF WORK.

01:13.990 --> 01:16.117
- I'M HERE TO [bleep] FIGHT,
I'M HERE TO RISE ABOVE.

01:16.201 --> 01:19.078
- DAVID, YOU DO NOT HAVE WHAT
IT TAKES TO BE INK MASTER.

01:22.415 --> 01:23.208
narrator: 14 ARTISTS REMAIN.

01:23.291 --> 01:27.462
BUT ONLY ONE WILL EARN
A $100,000 PRIZE

HAD AN INJURY

THIS GUY.

02:46.833 --> 02:48.293
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU CAME AT HIM
WITH A CHAIN SAW.

I WOULD'VE DONE IT
100% DIFFERENTLY.

YOU KNOW, YOU SLIP UP,

I'M TIRED OF BEING PERCEIVED

03:06.102 --> 03:08.563

YOU [bleep] UP YOUR NEXT TATTOO,

I'M GONNA RIDE YOU LIKE
A [bleep] $2 WHORE, HOMEBOY.

03:28.041 --> 03:30.293
- FLOWER SHOP?

03:34.088 --> 03:35.673
- WELCOME, ARTISTS.

03:35.757 --> 03:36.966
YOU MADE IT
THROUGH ANOTHER WEEK.

03:37.050 --> 03:40.136
BUT ONLY ONE OF YOU
WILL WALK AWAY WITH $100,000

03:40.219 --> 03:42.013
AND THE TITLE OF INK MASTER.

03:42.096 --> 03:45.183
THIS WEEK,
WE'RE TESTING PLACEMENT.

03:45.266 --> 03:48.645
{\an8}- PLACEMENT'S IMPORTANT,
BECAUSE YOU WANT TO NOT ONLY FIT

03:48.728 --> 03:49.854
{\an8}THE PERSON THAT YOU'RE TATTOOING

03:49.938 --> 03:52.148
{\an8}BUT FIT THE WAY
THAT THEIR BODY MOVES.

03:52.231 --> 03:54.943
A WRONG-PLACED TATTOO CAN MAKE
A REALLY NICE TATTOO LOOK

03:55.026 --> 03:56.110
LIKE A PIECE OF [bleep].

03:56.194 --> 03:58.655
- UNFORTUNATELY,
AS A TATTOO ARTIST,

03:58.738 --> 04:00.406
SOME OF YOUR BEST WORK
CAN END UP COVERED

04:00.490 --> 04:01.824
ON A DAY-TO-DAY BASIS.

04:01.908 --> 04:06.162
BUT THAT WON'T BE THE CASE
TODAY.

04:06.245 --> 04:08.081
LET'S MEET YOUR CANVASES.

04:13.836 --> 04:17.339
- HOLY [bleep].

04:17.423 --> 04:20.468
{\an8}- OH, MY GOD!
WHAT THE HELL ARE WE DOING?

04:23.471 --> 04:26.307
{\an8}- THEY'RE NAKED.
THEY'RE DEFINITELY VERY NAKED.

04:26.391 --> 04:27.392
{\an8}- GOD DAMN IT.

04:27.475 --> 04:29.894
{\an8}MY GIRLFRIEND IS GONNA BREAK UP
WITH ME TODAY.

04:33.439 --> 04:36.192
{\an8}- TODAY YOUR CANVASES WANT TO
ADORN THEIR BODIES WITH TATTOOS

04:36.275 --> 04:40.071
{\an8}THAT WILL LOOK GREAT
WHILE THEY ARE NUDE.

04:40.154 --> 04:42.657
{\an8}YOU MUST USE PLACEMENT
TO ACCENTUATE THE SHAPE

04:42.740 --> 04:44.033
{\an8}OF YOUR CANVAS'S BODY.

04:44.117 --> 04:46.244
{\an8}- THE FACT THAT OUR CANVASES
ARE NAKED

04:46.327 --> 04:47.161
{\an8}IS A REAL ADVANTAGE
TO PLACEMENT,

04:47.245 --> 04:49.872
{\an8}BECAUSE YOU CAN LOOK AT
THE TATTOO

04:49.956 --> 04:51.290
{\an8}AND MAKE SURE THAT IT GOES

04:51.374 --> 04:53.167
{\an8}WITH THE OVERALL FLOW
OF THE BODY.

04:53.251 --> 04:55.420
- THE WINNER
OF THE FLASH CHALLENGE

04:55.503 --> 04:56.462
WILL HAVE THE POWER TO ASSIGN

04:56.546 --> 04:59.674
ALL HUMAN CANVASES
IN THE ELIMINATION TATTOO.

04:59.757 --> 05:02.552
YOU'VE BEEN RANDOMLY ASSIGNED
A CANVAS

05:02.635 --> 05:03.136
AND HAVE THREE HOURS TO TATTOO.

05:03.219 --> 05:06.139
THESE CANVASES BARE ALL.

05:06.222 --> 05:09.976
IF YOU MESS UP,
THERE'S NO COVERING UP.

05:10.059 --> 05:14.522
YOUR TIME BEGINS NOW.

05:14.605 --> 05:18.317
{\an8}- I'M LOOKING FOR THE DESIGN
TO ENHANCE THE BODY SHAPE.

05:18.401 --> 05:20.278
- LIKE THIS AREA RIGHT HERE.

05:20.361 --> 05:21.279
- IF IT DOESN'T FLOW WELL
WITH THEIR BODY,

05:21.362 --> 05:23.531
THEN IT'S NOT THAT GOOD
OF A TATTOO.

05:26.576 --> 05:28.578
- SO YOU DROVE HERE NAKED?
- YEAH.

05:28.661 --> 05:30.580
- SO WE'VE GOT KIND OF, LIKE,
A LITTLE BIT OF VINE WORK

05:30.663 --> 05:31.998
AND STUFF LIKE THAT.
- RIGHT.

05:32.081 --> 05:34.000
- SO IF WE DID A LITTLE FLOWER
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT...

05:34.083 --> 05:35.168
{\an8}IT COULD BE SERIOUSLY
DISTRACTING HAVING TO TATTOO

05:35.251 --> 05:37.754
{\an8}WITH A BUNCH OF BOOBIES
RUNNING AROUND.

05:37.837 --> 05:39.338
{\an8}I HAVE TO LOOK STRAIGHT FORWARD
AT EYE LEVEL

05:39.422 --> 05:43.384
{\an8}AND GET THIS TATTOO DONE
OR ELSE I'M SCREWED.

05:43.468 --> 05:49.182
{\an8}- OKAY...

05:49.265 --> 05:51.100
{\an8}- OKAY.

05:51.184 --> 05:53.311
{\an8}IT IS THE DUMBEST THING
I'VE EVER [bleep] HEARD.

05:53.394 --> 05:57.106
MY CANVAS WANTS
AN UPSIDE-DOWN TREE

05:57.190 --> 05:58.608
THAT DOESN'T FLOW WITH THE BODY.

05:58.691 --> 06:01.402
I DON'T THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE
FLATTERING TO YOUR ARM,

06:01.486 --> 06:03.279
TO BE HONEST.

06:03.362 --> 06:05.656
DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER IDEAS?

06:05.740 --> 06:07.950
SHE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND
PLACEMENT.

06:08.034 --> 06:10.536
I WOULD RATHER TATTOO MYSELF
BUTT-ASS NAKED

06:10.620 --> 06:12.538
THAN GIVE YOU
AN UPSIDE-DOWN TREE.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.544
- I LIKE YOUR IDEA.

06:18.628 --> 06:19.837
IT'S GONNA BE GOOD.

06:19.921 --> 06:21.798
{\an8}THE GOAL FOR PLACEMENT
IS THAT THE TATTOO SHOULD LOOK

06:21.881 --> 06:23.299
{\an8}LIKE IT BELONGS
WHERE YOU'RE PUTTING IT.

06:23.382 --> 06:26.344
{\an8}GOING DOWN THE MIDDLE
WITH A SYMMETRICAL DESIGN,

06:26.427 --> 06:27.428
{\an8}YOU CAN'T GO WRONG.

06:27.512 --> 06:30.932
{\an8}I THINK I CAN WIN THIS CHALLENGE
NO PROBLEM.

06:31.015 --> 06:32.141
{\an8}- YOU DON'T WANT THAT THERE?

06:32.225 --> 06:34.977
{\an8}- I REFUSE TO TATTOO WITH
A PENIS LAYING BESIDE MY FACE.

06:35.061 --> 06:36.229
{\an8}- I FEEL OFFENDED.

06:36.312 --> 06:38.689
{\an8}- I'M GONNA COVER
THAT THING UP, MAN.

06:38.773 --> 06:40.983
{\an8}- YOU DON'T WANT IT DEAD-CENTER
TO THE LEG,

06:41.067 --> 06:42.735
{\an8}'CAUSE THE DESIGN LENDS ITSELF
TO GO AT AN ANGLE,

06:42.819 --> 06:44.153
{\an8}BECAUSE IT'S READING.

06:44.237 --> 06:45.988
{\an8}I'M SHAVING HIS LEG TO GET READY
TO PUT THE STENCIL ON,

06:46.072 --> 06:47.615
{\an8}AND I KEEP HITTING
HIS [bleep] PENIS

06:47.698 --> 06:48.991
{\an8}WITH THE TOP OF MY HAND.

06:49.075 --> 06:51.327
{\an8}I JUST HAVE TO CONCENTRATE
ON IGNORING HIS PENIS

06:51.410 --> 06:54.997
{\an8}AND JUST DOING A CLEAN TATTOO.

06:55.081 --> 06:56.415
{\an8}- I CAN ONLY IMAGINE
HOW TERRIBLE IT IS

06:56.499 --> 06:59.293
{\an8}TO HAVE SOMEBODY'S HAIRY BALLS
IN YOUR FACE

06:59.377 --> 07:00.503
{\an8}WHILE YOU'RE TATTOOING.

07:00.586 --> 07:02.672
{\an8}BETTER HIM THAN ME.
- TWO HOURS TO GO.

07:02.755 --> 07:06.551
{\an8}TWO HOURS.

07:10.555 --> 07:11.889
{\an8}- WHAT'S WRONG, BUBBA?
WHAT'S WRONG?

07:11.973 --> 07:14.934
{\an8}- HALO, SHUT UP.

07:15.017 --> 07:15.977
{\an8}I DIDN'T THINK FOR ONE SECOND
THAT I WOULD BE

07:16.060 --> 07:17.145
{\an8}IN THE BOTTOM LAST TIME.

07:17.228 --> 07:20.022
I'VE NEVER BEEN A PERSON EVER
TO GIVE UP ON ANYTHING.

07:20.106 --> 07:21.357
I'M NOT GONNA START NOW.

07:21.440 --> 07:23.484
- I WANT TO BE A FLY ON THE WALL
WHEN YOUR GIRL WATCHES THE SHOW.

07:23.568 --> 07:26.946
- 30 MINUTES, EVERYBODY.
30 MORE MINUTES.

07:30.449 --> 07:31.951
- YEAH, IT'S GETTING THERE, MAN.
IT'S GETTING THERE.

07:32.034 --> 07:35.371
{\an8}IT'S DEFINITELY A LITTLE AWKWARD
TALKING TO YOUR CANVAS

07:35.454 --> 07:37.206
{\an8}WHEN HE'S GOT HIS DICK
SWINGING AROUND IN YOUR FACE.

07:37.290 --> 07:39.834
{\an8}- APPARENTLY YOU HAVE A REALLY
NICE VIEW THERE, HALO.

07:39.917 --> 07:44.130
{\an8}- YEAH, LOOKING OVER THERE.
[laughs] NO OFFENSE.

07:44.213 --> 07:46.841
{\an8}- 15 MINUTES REMAIN.

07:46.924 --> 07:50.052
{\an8}- MY CANVAS WANTS A LOT
IN A SMALL AREA.

07:50.136 --> 07:52.054
{\an8}I'M REALLY, REALLY STRESSING.

07:52.138 --> 07:53.931
{\an8}- HEAD UP, HEAD UP, YEAH.

07:54.015 --> 07:56.309
{\an8}LAST WEEK, SAUSAGE WON.

07:56.392 --> 08:00.104
{\an8}I AM NOT GONNA LET SAUSAGE WIN
THIS CHALLENGE AT ANY COST.

08:00.188 --> 08:02.982
I'M GONNA PERFORM LIKE
A FRICKIN' PRIZEFIGHTER TODAY.

08:07.570 --> 08:11.908
- FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE.

08:11.991 --> 08:13.159
TIME'S UP, THAT'S IT.

08:13.242 --> 08:14.744
MACHINES DOWN.

08:14.827 --> 08:16.204
NO MORE INK.

08:16.287 --> 08:18.539
- GO PUT SOME CLOTHES ON,
WILL YOU, PLEASE?

08:18.623 --> 08:19.665
- ALL RIGHT, DARLING.

08:19.749 --> 08:22.460
{\an8}- RANDY'S TATTOO
IS [bleep] WEIRD.

08:22.543 --> 08:24.962
{\an8}IT'S JUST HANGING IN THE MIDDLE
OF THIS GIRL'S BACK.

08:25.046 --> 08:27.256
IT DEFINITELY DOESN'T HIT THE
MARK FOR A PLACEMENT CHALLENGE.

08:29.258 --> 08:31.886
- JIM, EXCITING DAY FOR YOU.

08:31.969 --> 08:33.095
- AT LEAST <i> HE</i>
DIDN'T GET EXCITED.

08:33.179 --> 08:34.931
- FAIR ENOUGH.

08:35.014 --> 08:36.933
- I TYPICALLY HATE IT WHEN
PEOPLE JUST STACK THE WRITING.

08:37.015 --> 08:38.308
SO I ACTUALLY STAGGERED IT,

08:38.392 --> 08:40.519
SO IT ACTUALLY GAVE IT
A LITTLE BIT MORE CURVE TO IT.

08:40.602 --> 08:41.812
- FOR WHAT IT IS,
IT HAS A GOOD FLOW

08:41.895 --> 08:42.813
IN THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN.

08:42.897 --> 08:47.777
AND OVERALL,
IT'S A NICE, SOLID TATTOO, MAN.

08:47.860 --> 08:50.404
- JAY, AS FAR AS PLACEMENT GOES,

08:50.488 --> 08:53.032
THE FACE OF THE CAT HAS
A "V" SHAPE TO IT,

08:53.115 --> 08:55.868
AND THE HUMAN BODY DOES WITH THE
LATS THAT COME IN TO THE WAIST.

08:55.952 --> 08:57.453
I THINK IT'S REALLY NICELY DONE.

08:57.536 --> 08:59.288
- IT LOOKS VERY SOFT.
THE LINES ARE VERY FINE.

08:59.372 --> 09:01.791
IT'S A REALLY NICE JOB.
- THANK YOU.

09:01.874 --> 09:03.209
- HALO.

09:03.292 --> 09:05.253
- HE WANTED A SCENE
IN THE SHAPE OF ANTARCTICA.

09:05.336 --> 09:07.296
- THE BEST THING YOU DID IS

09:07.380 --> 09:10.466
PICK THE LARGEST FLAT SURFACE
OF SKIN THAT YOU HAD

09:10.549 --> 09:11.926
TO JUST LET THIS TATTOO
SIT FLAT.

09:12.009 --> 09:13.177
IT DOES SIT NICE AS A TATTOO.

09:13.261 --> 09:15.554
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
- BUBBA.

09:15.638 --> 09:17.640
- I LIKE THE TATTOO ITSELF.

09:17.723 --> 09:19.684
MY ONLY COMPLAINT:
THAT BACKGROUND.

09:19.767 --> 09:21.727
HAVE IT NOT THERE
SO THAT ALL THAT WORK

09:21.811 --> 09:23.854
THAT YOU PUT INTO THE HOURGLASS
POPPED OUT MORE.

09:23.938 --> 09:26.023
YOU PUT A LOT OF WORK INTO IT.
DON'T TAKE AWAY FROM IT.

09:26.107 --> 09:28.317
- KYLE, AS FAR
AS PLACEMENT GOES--

09:28.401 --> 09:30.236
AND YOU HAVE THAT SLENDER LINE
OF THE CAT,

09:30.319 --> 09:32.405
WHICH GOES REALLY NICELY
WITH THIS FEMALE'S LOWER LEG.

09:32.488 --> 09:35.157
- THE IDEA WAS
TO SHAPE SOMETHING

09:35.241 --> 09:36.242
THAT WOULDN'T GIVE HER
A THICK ANKLE.

09:36.325 --> 09:38.828
- SMALL, DELICATE TATTOO,
VERY SIMPLE PLACEMENT.

09:38.911 --> 09:40.913
THIS IS ONE OF THE CLEANEST,
MOST LEGIBLE TATTOOS

09:40.997 --> 09:42.915
WE'VE EVER SEEN FROM YOU
IN THIS COMPETITION.

09:42.999 --> 09:44.792
- THANK YOU.
- LYDIA.

09:44.875 --> 09:45.876
- I REALLY LIKE THE SHAPE
OF THE DESIGN.

09:45.960 --> 09:48.212
GOOD JOB KNOWING THE PRINCIPLES
OF SHADING WATER.

09:48.296 --> 09:50.506
- THANK YOU.
- MATTI.

09:50.589 --> 09:53.217
- SHE REALLY LIKES
GERBERA DAISIES.

09:53.301 --> 09:54.844
SO I PUT THOSE TOGETHER
AND KIND OF ACCENTUATE

09:54.927 --> 09:58.556
THE WAY IT GOES FROM SHOULDER
TO THAT WIDE OPEN SPACE.

09:58.639 --> 10:01.100
- AS FAR AS THE PLACEMENT GOES,
IT'S GENERIC.

10:01.183 --> 10:04.395
I DON'T FEEL LIKE IT INTERACTS
WITH THE SHAPE OF HER BODY.

10:04.478 --> 10:05.479
- KEITH.

10:05.563 --> 10:07.273
- I DREW THE ANCHOR
AND THEN PLACED IT

10:07.356 --> 10:09.358
SO THAT THE SHAMROCKS CAN CUT
HIS RIBS.

10:09.442 --> 10:10.860
- IT RIDES THE SHAPE
OF HIS RIB NICELY.

10:10.943 --> 10:13.821
IT'S A MUCH STRONGER TATTOO
THAN WE'VE SEEN FROM YOU.

10:13.904 --> 10:16.324
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
- ROLAND.

10:16.407 --> 10:17.533
- I DEFINITELY LIKE THE WAY
IT FIT.

10:17.616 --> 10:18.701
MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS THE ENDING.

10:18.784 --> 10:21.871
YOU COULD'VE THROWN MORE FLOWERS
AROUND THE BOTTOM OF IT

10:21.954 --> 10:27.126
TO TAKE AWAY FROM THE FACT THAT
THAT BRANCH JUST STOPS.

10:27.209 --> 10:28.544
- MELISSA.

10:28.627 --> 10:31.505
- VERY NICE TO SEE YOU WERE ABLE
TO WORK WITH THAT AREA.

10:31.589 --> 10:32.548
IT FITS VERY NICE.

10:32.631 --> 10:33.299
- THE BIGGEST COMPLAINT
IS JUST GONNA BE

10:33.382 --> 10:36.093
THAT THE FISH IS VERY STATIC.

10:36.177 --> 10:37.219
YOU COULD'VE FOUND A WAY
TO MAYBE INCORPORATE

10:37.303 --> 10:39.764
MORE OF A NATURAL FLOW.

10:39.847 --> 10:41.390
- KING RUCK.

10:41.474 --> 10:42.558
- AS FAR AS PLACEMENT
OF THIS TATTOO,

10:42.641 --> 10:45.061
IT'S HARD TO READ
WHAT'S GOING ON,

10:45.144 --> 10:47.813
ESPECIALLY WITH THE CLUTTER
OF THE OTHER TATTOO.

10:47.897 --> 10:49.273
- RANDY.

10:49.357 --> 10:50.524
- THE EXECUTION ON THIS
IS MUCH BETTER

10:50.608 --> 10:52.318
THAN WE'VE SEEN
IN THE PAST.

10:52.401 --> 10:54.695
BUT THE BIGGEST ISSUE WITH IT
IS GONNA BE THE PLACEMENT.

10:54.779 --> 10:57.907
IT'S JUST GONNA BE VERY HARD
TO ADD TO IN THE FUTURE.

10:57.990 --> 10:59.992
- SAUSAGE.

11:00.076 --> 11:02.286
- A LOT OF DETAIL,
A LOT OF SMOOTH FADES,

11:02.370 --> 11:03.496
A LOT OF SOLID COVERAGE.

11:03.579 --> 11:05.039
AS FAR AS PLACEMENT ON THE BODY,

11:05.122 --> 11:06.624
THE SQUARED-OFF, FLAT LETTERS
ON THE BOTTOM,

11:06.707 --> 11:09.377
THE WAY IT ENDS
JUST KIND OF STOPS.

11:09.460 --> 11:10.795
IT WOULD'VE FLOWED A LOT BETTER
WITH THE LEG

11:10.878 --> 11:14.965
JUST TO LET THAT TATTOO END
AS SOFTLY AS IT BEGINS.

11:15.049 --> 11:17.468
- SCOTT, THE IMAGE DOES GO
REALLY WELL

11:17.551 --> 11:19.428
WITH THE NATURAL SHAPE
OF THE BODY.

11:19.512 --> 11:20.971
- THAT'S AN AWKWARD POSITION
FOR SOMEBODY

11:21.055 --> 11:22.223
WHO'S NOT REALLY WELL-VERSED
IN PLACEMENT.

11:22.306 --> 11:24.433
BUT YOU SHOWED US THAT YOU HAVE
WHAT IT TAKES TO DO THIS.

11:24.517 --> 11:25.601
- AWESOME.

11:25.684 --> 11:29.438
{\an8}- A TREE IS PROBABLY THE EASIEST
THING YOU COULD'VE DONE

11:29.522 --> 11:31.190
{\an8}TO SHOW PLACEMENT.

11:31.273 --> 11:32.900
{\an8}BRANCHES CAN GO
IN ANY DIRECTION.

11:32.983 --> 11:33.317
{\an8}THEY CAN MAKE ANY SHAPE.

11:33.401 --> 11:35.528
{\an8}IT'S A COP-OUT.

11:35.611 --> 11:37.530
{\an8}- YOU'RE JUST COVERED
COMPLETELY?

11:37.613 --> 11:38.864
{\an8}IT'S A PLACEMENT CHALLENGE.

11:38.948 --> 11:41.409
{\an8}I'M SO PISSED RIGHT NOW.
[bleep].

11:41.492 --> 11:43.119
- IS YOUR COLOR
AS SOLID AS SCOTT'S?

11:43.202 --> 11:45.121
- HELL, NO.
- YOU'RE FALLING SHORT, BUD.

11:50.584 --> 11:53.045
- TODAY'S CHALLENGE
WAS PLACEMENT.

11:53.129 --> 11:54.296
LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT WHO DID THE BEST.

11:54.380 --> 11:56.632
- WELL, ONE OF THE MAIN THINGS
I LIKE ABOUT SCOTT'S TATTOO

11:56.715 --> 11:58.175
IS JUST THE SIZE WAS PERFECT.

11:58.259 --> 12:00.511
IT FIT JUST RIGHT.

12:00.594 --> 12:03.305
- SAUSAGE DID A REALLY NICE JOB
PLACING THAT TATTOO ON THE CALF.

12:03.389 --> 12:06.517
- BUT AS FAR AS PLACEMENT GOES,
IT WAS AVERAGE.

12:06.600 --> 12:08.978
GENTLE JAY'S TATTOO,
I LIKE THE WAY IT SITS.

12:09.061 --> 12:10.396
- IT'S MY FAVORITE TATTOO
I'VE SEEN HIM DO

12:10.479 --> 12:13.441
SINCE THIS COMPETITION STARTED.

12:13.524 --> 12:16.152
- AS FAR AS THE WORST PLACEMENTS
OF THE DAY, RANDY.

12:16.235 --> 12:17.153
HE DREW THAT LIMB.

12:17.236 --> 12:18.821
IT WOULD'VE BEEN BETTER

12:18.904 --> 12:20.698
TO JUST HAVE THE LIZARD
CRAWLING DOWN HER BACK.

12:20.781 --> 12:22.992
- SHE INITIALLY WAS TALKING
ABOUT THE FOREARM.

12:23.075 --> 12:25.161
THAT CHAMELEON WOULD'VE FIT
REALLY BEAUTIFULLY THERE,

12:25.244 --> 12:26.829
RIGHT ON THE ARM.
- A LOT NICER.

12:26.912 --> 12:30.332
- KING RUCK--HIS PLACEMENT
BOTHERS ME MORE THAN RANDY'S.

12:30.416 --> 12:31.459
IT'S JUST AWKWARD.
- BAD DECISION.

12:31.542 --> 12:33.836
- WELL, IT SOUNDS LIKE WE HAVE
A SOLID DECISION HERE.

12:33.919 --> 12:36.547
- YEAH.
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO IT.

12:36.630 --> 12:39.967
TODAY WE ASKED YOU
TO USE PLACEMENT

12:40.050 --> 12:41.510
TO CREATE A TATTOO

12:41.594 --> 12:42.761
THAT PERFECTLY COMPLIMENTS
THE HUMAN BODY.

12:42.845 --> 12:46.765
SOME OF YOU MADE YOUR CANVASES
PROUD TO BARE ALL.

12:46.849 --> 12:47.766
SAUSAGE.

12:47.850 --> 12:50.728
- BEAUTIFULLY EXECUTED,
VERY SOLID.

12:50.811 --> 12:52.396
IT WORKS WELL
FOR THE BACK OF THE LEG.

12:52.480 --> 12:54.732
- THANK YOU.
- SCOTT.

12:54.815 --> 12:56.901
- WE'RE VERY IMPRESSED WITH
THE TECHNICAL APPLICATION

12:56.984 --> 12:58.194
OF YOUR TATTOO.

12:58.277 --> 13:00.154
SUPER CLEAN,
NICE, BRIGHT COLORS.

13:00.237 --> 13:02.114
GOOD JOB.
- GENTLE JAY.

13:02.198 --> 13:04.533
- THE TATTOOING
WAS DELICATE ENOUGH

13:04.617 --> 13:06.702
TO REALLY COMPLIMENT
THE GIRL'S FRAME.

13:06.785 --> 13:07.745
IT WAS JUST A GREAT TATTOO.

13:07.828 --> 13:09.038
- THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED

13:09.121 --> 13:12.500
THAT THE WINNER
OF TODAY'S FLASH CHALLENGE IS...

13:17.046 --> 13:18.255
SCOTT.
- THANKS A LOT, GUYS.

13:18.339 --> 13:20.883
[applause]

13:20.966 --> 13:22.885
- I GOT SCREWED.

13:22.968 --> 13:25.721
{\an8}DOING A PORTRAIT OF A CAT
IS HARDER

13:25.804 --> 13:27.056
{\an8}THAN DOING A [bleep] TREE.

13:27.139 --> 13:29.600
{\an8}- YOU WILL HAVE THE POWER
TO ASSIGN ALL THE HUMAN CANVASES

13:29.683 --> 13:31.143
{\an8}IN THE ELIMINATION TATTOO.

13:31.227 --> 13:34.063
{\an8}- EVERYONE'S PLAYING, LIKE,
HOLDING HANDS AND REALLY NICE.

13:34.146 --> 13:36.774
AND I'M READY TO HAND OUT SKULLS
AND END THAT [bleep].

13:36.857 --> 13:38.067
NO ONE IS GETTING THE EASY ROUTE
WITH ME.

13:38.150 --> 13:42.279
- HEAD BACK TO THE LOFT AND
PREPARE TO MEET YOUR CANVASES

13:42.363 --> 13:43.906
FOR THE ELIMINATION TATTOO.

13:52.831 --> 13:54.917
- CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR WIN.
- THANKS, MAN.

13:55.000 --> 13:55.751
- ANY GAME PLANS
ON GOING INTO THIS?

13:55.834 --> 13:58.087
- JUST PLAYING MY HAND
THE BEST I CAN.

13:58.170 --> 13:59.755
SO I GOT TO KEEP HALO FROM
TAKING THE PRIZE,

13:59.838 --> 14:02.508
I GOT TO KEEP YOU
FROM TAKING THE PRIZE,

14:02.591 --> 14:04.552
AND MAKE IT EASY FOR MYSELF.

14:04.635 --> 14:07.179
- YOU KNOW, I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO PLAY ADMIRABLY.

14:07.263 --> 14:08.806
- I DON'T THINK IT'S
ANY LESS ADMIRABLE.

14:08.889 --> 14:10.641
I MEAN, PLAYING A SPORT,
YOU WOULDN'T MAKE IT EASY

14:10.724 --> 14:12.309
FOR YOUR OPPONENT.

14:12.393 --> 14:12.935
- YOU'RE BASICALLY
TALKING ABOUT GUNNING

14:13.018 --> 14:14.061
FOR THE PEOPLE AT THE TOP.

14:14.144 --> 14:15.563
- WHY WOULDN'T YOU, THOUGH?
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

14:15.646 --> 14:16.564
I WANT TO MAKE IT HARDER
FOR YOU.

14:16.647 --> 14:17.690
WHY WOULD I MAKE IT EASY
FOR YOU,

14:17.773 --> 14:18.899
WHEN YOU'VE WON
TWO CHALLENGES ALREADY?

14:18.983 --> 14:21.068
- OH, YOU DON'T HAVE TO MAKE IT
EASY FOR ME.

14:21.151 --> 14:22.528
I KNOW WHAT I'M BRINGING
TO THE GAME.

14:22.611 --> 14:25.489
- I'M GONNA TRY TO STICK IT
TO EVERYBODY, REALLY.

14:25.573 --> 14:26.699
- ANYBODY THAT HAPPENS
TO SURVIVE

14:26.782 --> 14:28.409
WILL THEN PUT A TARGET
ON YOUR BACK.

14:28.492 --> 14:31.245
- GOOD. BRING IT.

14:42.298 --> 14:44.341
- WELCOME
TO THE ELIMINATION TATTOO.

14:44.425 --> 14:46.510
IMPRESS US AND YOU'LL HAVE
ANOTHER WEEK TO PROVE

14:46.594 --> 14:50.806
THAT YOU DESERVE $100,000
AND THE TITLE OF INK MASTER.

14:50.889 --> 14:53.726
YOU'LL BE JUDGED BY OLIVER PECK,
CHRIS NUNEZ, AND MYSELF.

14:53.809 --> 14:54.852
BUT WE'RE NOT YOUR ONLY CRITICS.

14:54.935 --> 14:59.440
EACH WEEK, YOU'LL ALSO BE JUDGED
BY ALL OF AMERICA.

14:59.523 --> 15:01.525
VIEWERS AT HOME WILL SCOUR
EVERY DETAIL

15:01.609 --> 15:04.987
OF YOUR ELIMINATION TATTOOS
AT INKMASTER.SPIKE.COM

15:05.070 --> 15:07.990
AND VOTE FOR THE TATTOO
THAT THEY THINK IS THE BEST.

15:08.073 --> 15:09.908
AMERICA'S VOTE WILL HAVE
A MASSIVE IMPACT

15:09.992 --> 15:12.578
AT THE LIVE FINALE.

15:12.661 --> 15:14.413
WE ALSO HAVE
A VERY SPECIAL GUEST JUDGE.

15:14.496 --> 15:18.792
HE IS A SIX-TIME ALL-STAR, MVP,
AND CY YOUNG AWARD WINNER,

15:18.876 --> 15:21.503
STAR PITCHER
OF THE NEW YORK YANKEES...

15:21.587 --> 15:22.421
CC SABATHIA.

15:22.504 --> 15:26.133
- OH!
- YEAH!

15:26.216 --> 15:27.968
- [laughs]

15:28.052 --> 15:30.012
- A LOT OF GUYS THAT I'VE
PLAYED WITH HAVE A LOT OF TATS.

15:30.095 --> 15:31.555
AND WHEN YOU COME
IN THE CLUBHOUSE,

15:31.639 --> 15:33.223
IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN
KINDA BREAK THE ICE WITH.

15:33.307 --> 15:34.058
{\an8}I GOT MY FIRST TATTOO
WHEN I WAS 15,

15:34.141 --> 15:36.352
{\an8}AND I'VE BEEN ADDICTED
EVER SINCE.

15:36.435 --> 15:38.979
- THAT'S AWESOME.

15:39.063 --> 15:41.732
- IN THE ELIMINATION TATTOO,
IT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER

15:41.815 --> 15:42.816
TO WIN TATTOO OF THE DAY,

15:42.900 --> 15:44.943
BECAUSE THE WINNER
MUST PUT ONE ARTIST

15:45.027 --> 15:46.028
UP FOR ELIMINATION.

15:46.111 --> 15:49.365
THIS WEEK,
WE'RE TESTING PLACEMENT.

15:49.448 --> 15:52.076
{\an8}- PLACEMENT IS JUST HAVING
THINGS IN THE RIGHT SPOT,

15:52.159 --> 15:54.411
{\an8}MAKING SURE THAT WHATEVER YOU DO
IN YOUR TATTOO,

15:54.495 --> 15:56.955
{\an8}THOSE THINGS ARE PLACED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH EACH OTHER

15:57.039 --> 16:00.876
{\an8}AND THAT THE TATTOO IS PLACED
IN A GOOD SPOT.

16:00.959 --> 16:05.506
{\an8}- TODAY YOU MUST CREATE
AN AQUATIC TATTOO.

16:05.589 --> 16:08.133
{\an8}FROM CORAL AND PLANTS TO FISH,
BUBBLES, SHARKS, AND MERMAIDS,

16:08.217 --> 16:12.554
{\an8}AQUATIC TATTOOS ARE COMPOSED
OF A COMPLEX ARRANGEMENT

16:12.638 --> 16:14.139
{\an8}OF MANY SMALLER ELEMENTS.

16:14.223 --> 16:16.850
{\an8}- IN AN AQUATIC TATTOO,
PLACEMENT IS EVERYTHING.

16:16.934 --> 16:18.560
{\an8}DOWN IN THE OCEAN,
THERE'S A LOT OF [bleep]

16:18.644 --> 16:19.895
{\an8}NEXT TO A LOT OF [bleep].

16:19.978 --> 16:23.565
{\an8}IF IT'S WRONG, YOU [bleep]
THE ENTIRE THING UP.

16:23.649 --> 16:26.110
{\an8}- LET'S MEET YOUR CANVASES.

16:28.862 --> 16:31.907
{\an8}SCOTT, YOU WON
THE FLASH CHALLENGE.

16:31.990 --> 16:35.035
{\an8}YOU NOW HAVE THE POWER
TO ASSIGN ALL HUMAN CANVASES.

16:35.119 --> 16:38.247
{\an8}THIS IS YOUR CHANCE
TO SINK YOUR COMPETITION.

16:38.330 --> 16:41.250
{\an8}- I FINALLY HAVE THIS ADVANTAGE,
AND I'M NOT GONNA WASTE IT.

16:41.333 --> 16:42.751
- SEA HORSE OUTLINE ON MY SIDE.

16:42.835 --> 16:44.420
- I'M GONNA STRIKE
WHILE THE IRON'S HOT

16:44.503 --> 16:47.381
AND HAND OUT THE HARD SKULLS
TO THE TOP ARTISTS.

16:47.464 --> 16:49.591
- CORAL REEF WITH A SEA TURTLE
ON MY LEFT ARM.

16:49.675 --> 16:50.592
- SHE'S CRAZY.

16:50.676 --> 16:52.177
- SCOTT REALLY FEARS ME
IN THIS COMPETITION.

16:52.261 --> 16:53.679
{\an8}HE DEFINITELY DOESN'T WANT
TO SEE ME IN THE TOP.

16:53.762 --> 16:57.099
{\an8}- POSEIDON ON MY LEFT ASS CHEEK.

16:59.810 --> 17:01.145
{\an8}- I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM
SERVING [bleep] UP,

17:01.228 --> 17:04.147
{\an7}BECAUSE IT'S ONLY GONNA SECURE
MY POSITION IN THIS COMPETITION.

17:04.231 --> 17:05.441
{\an8}WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING
TO GET DONE, MAN?

17:05.523 --> 17:07.943
{\an8}- A DEEP-SEA DIVER
WITH AN OCTOPUS.

17:08.026 --> 17:09.528
{\an8}- A TREASURE CHEST
WITH CHILDHOOD TRINKETS

17:09.611 --> 17:12.364
{\an8}FLOATING ABOVE IT.

17:12.448 --> 17:14.616
{\an8}- OH, THAT SOUNDS
LIKE A TERRIBLE IDEA.

17:21.039 --> 17:22.040
- SAUSAGE, YOU ARE NOT GOING
TO WIN TODAY.

17:26.377 --> 17:30.132
- CANVASES, ONE BY ONE,
PLEASE READ THE ARTIST'S NAME

17:30.215 --> 17:31.508
ON THE BOTTOM OF YOUR SKULL.

17:31.592 --> 17:34.803
- SCOTT.
- GENTLE JAY.

17:34.887 --> 17:36.472
- WHAT'S UP, MAN?
- KEITH.

17:36.555 --> 17:38.682
- MATTI.
- JIM.

17:38.766 --> 17:40.976
- LYDIA.
- HALO.

17:41.059 --> 17:43.437
- I GOT ALL THE TRINKETS
UNDERWATER.

17:43.520 --> 17:45.063
{\an8}IT'S THE HARDEST PIECE TO DO.

17:45.147 --> 17:47.566
{\an8}LET THE GAMES BEGIN.
- KYLE.

17:47.649 --> 17:49.693
{\an8}- ROLAND.
- MELISSA.

17:55.824 --> 17:59.161
{\an8}- BUBBA.
- IT'S A BUTT TATTOO.

17:59.244 --> 18:00.996
{\an8}I DON'T WANT TO [bleep] DO IT.
IT'S STUPID.

18:01.079 --> 18:03.999
{\an8}I'M SO MAD RIGHT NOW.
- RANDY.

18:04.082 --> 18:05.876
{\an8}- KING RUCK.
- SAUSAGE.

18:05.959 --> 18:07.544
{\an8}- I GET NAILED WITH THE DIVER
AND AN OCTOPUS.

18:07.628 --> 18:10.005
{\an8}IT DOESN'T MATTER.

18:10.088 --> 18:12.090
{\an8}COME HELL OR HIGH WATER, I'LL
BEAT SCOTT ON HIS BEST DAY.

18:16.887 --> 18:20.224
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS, REMEMBER,
AFTER THE ELIMINATION TATTOO,

18:20.307 --> 18:23.018
THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY WILL VOTE
ON THE TATTOO THAT THEY THINK

18:23.101 --> 18:27.731
IS THE WORST AND PUT ONE OF YOU
UP FOR ELIMINATION.

18:27.815 --> 18:29.107
AND THE WINNER
OF TATTOO OF THE DAY

18:29.191 --> 18:32.945
WILL ALSO PUT AN ARTIST UP
FOR ELIMINATION.

18:33.028 --> 18:34.738
YOU HAVE THE REST OF THE EVENING

18:34.822 --> 18:36.198
TO CONSULT
WITH YOUR HUMAN CANVAS.

18:36.281 --> 18:39.201
TOMORROW YOU'LL HAVE SIX HOURS
TO CREATE AN AQUATIC TATTOO.

18:39.284 --> 18:44.164
BASED ON YOUR WORK,
ONE OF YOU WILL BE CLOSING SHOP.

18:44.248 --> 18:47.376
GOOD LUCK.

18:47.459 --> 18:49.211
{\an8}- THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE THESE
ARTISTS ARE GONNA HAVE

18:49.294 --> 18:51.046
{\an8}IS JUST GETTING
ALL THE ELEMENTS,

18:51.129 --> 18:54.716
{\an8}WHETHER IT'S FISH, CORAL, WATER,
TO FIT INTO THE SAME TATTOO

18:54.800 --> 18:56.552
{\an8}AND HAVE NICE PLACEMENT
ON THE BODY.

18:56.635 --> 18:58.095
- I WANT TO DO
MY, LIKE, LOWER LEG.

18:58.178 --> 18:59.471
- THE LOWER LEG? OKAY.
- YEAH.

18:59.555 --> 19:01.181
- YOU WANTED THE SEA HORSE.
- YES.

19:01.265 --> 19:02.391
- AND YOU WANTED AN OCEAN SCENE
INSIDE OF THAT.

19:02.474 --> 19:03.016
- CORRECT.

19:03.100 --> 19:05.060
- WHAT ARE THE ODDS OF ME

19:05.144 --> 19:06.854
TALKING YOU OUT OF
GETTING IT ON YOUR ASS?

19:06.937 --> 19:08.397
DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER OPEN AREAS
THAT YOU'D WANT?

19:08.480 --> 19:10.065
- NO.

19:10.148 --> 19:11.859
- WHAT ABOUT YOUR THIGHS?
- THIGHS ARE COVERED.

19:11.942 --> 19:13.318
- CALVES?
- ALL THE WAY UP.

19:13.402 --> 19:14.528
- YOU'RE JUST COVERED
COMPLETELY?

19:14.611 --> 19:16.488
- YUP.
- [bleep].

19:16.572 --> 19:18.365
{\an8}THIS GUY ONLY HAS AN 8x8 AREA
ON HIS WHOLE, ENTIRE BODY

19:18.448 --> 19:21.118
{\an8}FOR ME TO TATTOO,
AND IT'S A PLACEMENT CHALLENGE.

19:21.201 --> 19:23.453
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING AQUATIC
ON YOU?

19:23.537 --> 19:24.496
NOTHING?
- NO.

19:24.580 --> 19:25.414
- I'M SO PISSED RIGHT NOW.

19:25.497 --> 19:27.583
- IDEALLY, LIKE,
POSEIDON IN A CHARIOT

19:27.666 --> 19:29.668
WITH A HORSE AND WAVES.

19:29.751 --> 19:30.961
- CHARIOT, HORSE, AND WAVES?
- YEAH.

19:31.044 --> 19:34.590
- THIS GUY COULD COST ME
$100,000.

19:44.266 --> 19:45.475
- WHAT'S UP, HALO?

19:45.559 --> 19:46.727
WHAT YOU GOT, KIDDO?

19:46.810 --> 19:47.853
- I GOT A WHOLE THIGH, DUDE.

19:47.936 --> 19:51.607
- [whistles]
GOOD LUCK, MAN.

19:51.690 --> 19:52.733
[whistling]

19:52.816 --> 19:54.943
AS I'M WALKING AROUND,

19:55.027 --> 19:57.029
I'M GETTING DIRTY LOOKS
FROM EVERYBODY.

19:57.112 --> 19:59.281
I DID A GREAT JOB
HANDING OUT SKULLS.

19:59.364 --> 20:01.700
SAUSAGE, WHAT YOU GOT?
- UNDERWATER SCENE.

20:01.783 --> 20:03.785
- YEAH, IT'S A LOT OF WORK, MAN.
- IT'S A TON OF WORK.

20:03.869 --> 20:04.953
THE GUY THAT I'M DEALING
WITH IS--

20:05.037 --> 20:07.623
- THAT DUDE
WAS JUST INTIMIDATING, MAN.

20:07.706 --> 20:08.248
- HE'S PRETTY TO HIS GUNS.

20:08.332 --> 20:09.958
- EVEN TO ME, I WAS LIKE,

20:10.042 --> 20:11.376
"MAN, HE'D BE A TOUGH CLIENT
TO WORK ON."

20:11.460 --> 20:12.336
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

20:12.419 --> 20:16.131
SO I WAS LIKE, "SAUSAGE."
- RIGHT.

20:16.214 --> 20:17.841
- YOU DIDN'T LIKE THE ONE
I GAVE YOU?

20:17.925 --> 20:19.134
- SCOTT'S SCREWING OVER A LOT
OF PEOPLE.

20:19.217 --> 20:22.804
{\an8}I KNOW HE'S PLAYING THE GAME,
BUT RIGHT NOW HE'S BEING A DICK.

20:22.888 --> 20:25.140
NERVOUS, NERVOUS, NERVOUS.

20:25.223 --> 20:29.853
- YOU HAVE SIX HOURS TO CREATE
AN AQUATIC TATTOO.

20:29.937 --> 20:33.732
AND YOUR TIME BEGINS...NOW.

20:33.815 --> 20:34.942
- LET'S DO IT.

20:35.025 --> 20:36.526
- ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.
- YES.

20:36.610 --> 20:37.653
- COME ON, BUD.

20:37.736 --> 20:39.780
{\an8}- TODAY I WOULD LOVE TO SEE SOME
REALLY COOL ARTWORK.

20:39.863 --> 20:41.990
{\an8}DOING AN AQUATIC TATTOO
TAKES ARTISTRY.

20:42.074 --> 20:44.159
{\an8}IT'LL BE INTERESTING TO SEE
WHO SHINES AND WHO DOESN'T.

20:44.242 --> 20:45.535
{\an8}- YOU READY?
- YEAH.

20:45.619 --> 20:50.207
{\an8}[machines buzzing]

20:50.290 --> 20:54.836
{\an8}- I'M JUST SO [bleep] MAD
AT THE WHOLE SITUATION.

20:54.920 --> 20:56.380
{\an8}I'M MAD THAT SCOTT GAVE
THIS ONE TO ME,

20:56.463 --> 20:58.048
{\an8}MAD THAT IT'S PLACED
WHERE IT IS.

20:58.131 --> 21:00.133
I WAS UP TILL, LIKE, 3:00 OR
4:00, TRYING TO COME UP

21:00.217 --> 21:01.677
WITH A COOL CONCEPT.

21:01.760 --> 21:03.971
I SPECIFICALLY WON'T TATTOO
SOMEONE'S ASS BACK HOME

21:04.054 --> 21:05.847
BECAUSE IT'S UNCOMFORTABLE
FOR ME.

21:05.931 --> 21:07.516
- IS THIS THE ODDEST SPOT
YOU'VE TATTOOED?

21:07.599 --> 21:09.559
- YEAH.

21:09.643 --> 21:11.395
I'M VERY, VERY UPSET
ABOUT THIS THING.

21:11.478 --> 21:15.232
AND IT'S AFFECTING EVERYTHING
THAT I'M DOING.

21:15.315 --> 21:17.401
- THE ONLY WAY TO GET BACK AT
SCOTT IS TO TAKE THE DIFFICULT

21:17.484 --> 21:22.406
CHALLENGES THAT HE SETS FOR ME
AND KNOCK THEM OUT OF THE PARK.

21:22.489 --> 21:24.491
YOU KNOW WHAT'S AWESOME
ABOUT YOUR TATTOO?

21:24.574 --> 21:25.993
- WHAT'S THAT?
- EVERYTHING.

21:26.076 --> 21:26.910
- [laughs]

21:26.994 --> 21:28.078
- DON'T LET ANYBODY TELL YOU
DIFFERENT.

21:28.161 --> 21:31.373
I'M NOT GONNA LAY DOWN.
I'M HERE TO WIN.

21:31.456 --> 21:33.542
I'VE HAD A PRETTY GOOD STREAK
LATELY, SO...

21:33.625 --> 21:35.043
- GOOD.
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

21:35.127 --> 21:36.795
{\an8}SCOTT REALLY SCREWED SAUSAGE.

21:36.878 --> 21:39.423
HE'S GOT A REALLY TIGHT,
INTRICATE DESIGN TO DO

21:39.506 --> 21:40.507
IN SIX HOURS.

21:40.590 --> 21:43.719
THAT COULD BE THE DOWNFALL
OF HIM.

21:43.802 --> 21:46.304
- FOUR HOURS TO GO.

21:50.976 --> 21:53.770
- DOING OKAY?
- [sighs]

21:53.854 --> 21:56.064
- READY?
I'M FROM HAWAII, MAN.

21:56.148 --> 21:58.066
THIS IS THE [bleep] THAT I DO.

21:58.150 --> 21:59.484
{\an8}I HAVE TO NAIL THIS [bleep]
TATTOO.

21:59.568 --> 22:02.571
{\an8}AND NOT ONLY THAT,
BUT SHE HAS TO SIT PERFECTLY.

22:02.654 --> 22:04.990
{\an8}I CAN TELL SHE'S ALREADY
BEGINNING TO HIT THE WALL.

22:05.073 --> 22:07.826
{\an8}AND I HAVEN'T EVEN DONE
THE COLOR YET.

22:07.909 --> 22:10.287
{\an8}- MM.

22:10.370 --> 22:13.540
{\an8}- THE PRESSURE OF THIS
COMPETITION IS SO OVERWHELMING

22:13.623 --> 22:14.750
{\an8}RIGHT NOW.

22:14.833 --> 22:17.044
I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE GONNA REGRET THIS.

22:17.127 --> 22:20.589
HOPEFULLY NOT, ANYWAYS.
A LOT IS AT STAKE FOR ME.

22:20.672 --> 22:22.799
BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT I'M
A GAY TATTOO ARTIST,

22:22.883 --> 22:25.010
I HAVE TO REPRESENT.

22:25.093 --> 22:26.595
HOW ARE YOU GUYS DOING?

22:26.678 --> 22:31.183
- RANDY IS DOING A CRAZY SQUID
AND WHALE WITH THIS HUGE FIELD

22:31.266 --> 22:33.393
OF BLUE UNDERNEATH IT.

22:33.477 --> 22:35.020
IT'S JUST SENSELESS WASTE
OF SPACE.

22:35.103 --> 22:39.608
RANDY'S IN SOME DEEP [bleep].

22:39.691 --> 22:40.400
- TWO HOURS REMAINING,
EVERYBODY.

22:44.154 --> 22:47.532
- [whimpering]
- IT'S OKAY.

22:51.203 --> 22:52.079
- HOW ARE YOU DOING, MAN?
- GOOD, MAN.

22:52.162 --> 22:53.288
HOW ARE YOU?

22:53.371 --> 22:55.499
{\an8}- MY CANVAS WANTS SO MANY
ELEMENTS AND SO MANY OBJECTS.

22:55.582 --> 22:56.958
SHE WANTED A WISHBONE,
A MUSIC NOTE, AN ORCHID,

22:57.042 --> 23:01.129
A BOW, A DIAMOND, A ROSARY,

23:01.213 --> 23:02.130
AND A MAGIC WAND,
AND A TREASURE CHEST.

23:02.214 --> 23:03.965
- A ROSARY ALONE
WOULD TAKE UP SOME TIME.

23:04.049 --> 23:05.258
- WE TALKED HER DOWN TO SEVEN.

23:05.342 --> 23:07.803
NORMALLY, I DON'T EVER HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT TIME WHEN I TATTOO.

23:07.886 --> 23:09.221
I JUST GET IN, GET OUT.

23:09.304 --> 23:12.808
THIS TIME, I'M STARTING TO FEEL
THE PRESSURE OF THE TIME.

23:12.891 --> 23:14.976
- ONE MORE HOUR.

23:15.060 --> 23:17.687
- YEAH, I DON'T LIKE THAT.

23:17.771 --> 23:19.147
[machine buzzing]

23:19.231 --> 23:20.774
- I DEFINITELY HAVE WIND
IN MY SAILS

23:20.857 --> 23:22.317
WINNING THE FLASH CHALLENGE.

23:22.400 --> 23:23.443
{\an8}I KNOW THE JUDGES
GOT THEIR EYE ON ME.

23:23.527 --> 23:28.031
I KNOW I PICKED ONE OF
THE STRONGEST PIECES UP THERE.

23:28.115 --> 23:29.491
I COULDN'T ASK
FOR A BETTER CANVAS, BRO.

23:29.574 --> 23:31.159
THIS IS [bleep] EXCELLENT.

23:31.243 --> 23:33.161
I'M NOT EVEN THINKING LIKE
IT'S A COMPETITION RIGHT NOW.

23:33.245 --> 23:36.248
I'M THINKING THAT I'M DOING
THE BEST TATTOO OF MY CAREER.

23:39.209 --> 23:40.001
- I LOVE MY TATTOO.

23:40.085 --> 23:42.212
{\an8}I THINK IT LOOKS BEAUTIFUL.

23:42.295 --> 23:43.463
WORD AROUND THE STREET
IS I'M EXCELLENT.

23:43.547 --> 23:46.716
I NOT ONLY WOULD LIKE TO WIN
THIS CHALLENGE,

23:46.800 --> 23:48.176
I HAVE A NEED
TO WIN ONE OF THESE CHALLENGES

23:48.260 --> 23:51.179
EARLY ON TO EVEN REMAIN
IN CONTENTION.

23:51.263 --> 23:52.514
HOPING WE CAN FINISH IT
AND PLEASE THE JUDGES.

23:52.597 --> 23:55.433
I THINK I KNOW WHAT THEY LIKE
SOMETIMES,

23:55.517 --> 23:57.435
AND I'M ALWAYS SO WRONG.

23:57.519 --> 24:01.148
THERE IS INTENSE AMOUNTS
OF PRESSURE FOR ME TO PROVE

24:01.231 --> 24:04.442
THAT I DO HAVE WHAT IT TAKES
TO BE INK MASTER.

24:04.526 --> 24:09.698
- TEN, NINE, EIGHT, SEVEN, SIX,

24:09.781 --> 24:14.703
FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE.

24:14.786 --> 24:15.787
THAT'S IT.
MACHINES DOWN.

24:15.871 --> 24:19.875
NO MORE INK.
- OOH!

24:19.958 --> 24:22.085
- THAT'S SICK, DUDE.
- SEE?

24:22.169 --> 24:23.837
- SICK.
- I TOLD YOU WE'D GET THERE.

24:23.920 --> 24:25.922
- DUDE, THAT'S
[bleep] INCREDIBLE.

24:26.006 --> 24:28.925
THAT IS AWESOME.
- VERY COOL.

24:29.009 --> 24:30.594
- BUBBA DID A POSEIDON,
BUT HE LOOKS MORE

24:30.677 --> 24:33.722
LIKE A MUSCULAR SANTA, LIKE,
WHIPPING SOME REINDEER.

24:33.805 --> 24:35.432
HE IS IN TROUBLE ON THIS.

24:35.515 --> 24:37.309
THE JUDGES ARE GONNA HAVE
A FIELD DAY.

24:40.312 --> 24:42.314
{\an8}- YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO DRAW.
- I THINK I'M IN THE TOP FIVE.

24:42.397 --> 24:45.192
{\an8}- YOU HAVE TO BE GOOD ON PAPER,
MAN.

24:45.275 --> 24:47.986
{\an8}- THEY'RE [bleep] ASS[bleep].
I'M [bleep] PISSED OFF.

24:54.743 --> 24:56.912
- BUBBA WAS MAD AT YOU.
- DUDE, EVERYONE'S MAD AT ME.

24:56.995 --> 24:58.747
- THERE HE IS.
SPEAK OF THE DEVIL.

24:58.830 --> 25:01.666
- HOW'D IT GO, MAN?
- [bleep].

25:01.750 --> 25:04.169
- YOU STILL HATE SCOTT?
- NO, I DON'T HATE YOU, DUDE.

25:04.252 --> 25:05.045
YOU JUST KNOW YOU'RE A DICK.

25:05.128 --> 25:07.589
- I JUST THOUGHT
IT WOULD BE FUNNY

25:07.672 --> 25:09.049
TO MAKE YOU DO
SOME GUY'S ASS.

25:09.132 --> 25:10.258
- WHY WOULD YOU [bleep] DO THAT?
- I'M TRYING TO WIN, MAN.

25:10.342 --> 25:11.593
THAT'S ALL IT IS.
- I KNOW, MAN.

25:11.676 --> 25:13.595
YOU'RE [bleep] PLAYING THE GAME
LIKE YOU SAID YOU WOULD.

25:13.678 --> 25:15.096
- I TRY TO MAKE IT HARD
FOR EVERYBODY.

25:15.180 --> 25:17.515
KEITH, HOW'D THAT PIECE PAN OUT
FOR YOU THAT I THREW AT YOU?

25:17.599 --> 25:19.601
I WAS HOPING IT WOULD, LIKE,
[bleep] YOU UP.

25:19.684 --> 25:21.728
- I DON'T LIKE THE WAY SCOTT'S
PLAYING THE GAME,

25:21.811 --> 25:22.604
'CAUSE HE'S NOT PLAYING
LIKE A MAN.

25:22.687 --> 25:25.357
HE'S PLAYING LIKE,
"TODAY IS MY DAY,

25:25.440 --> 25:26.775
AND [bleep] ALL YOU."

25:26.858 --> 25:28.276
AND I JUST DON'T THINK
THAT'S REALLY COOL.

25:28.360 --> 25:29.361
- I'M HAVING A BLAST.

25:29.444 --> 25:30.820
- I THINK YOU'RE ON THIN ICE,
MAN.

25:30.904 --> 25:34.783
I THINK YOU PUT THIS BIG TARGET
RIGHT ON YOUR BACK.

25:34.866 --> 25:36.910
- DISH IT BACK TO ME.

25:36.993 --> 25:38.995
AND I'LL TAKE IT.

♪ ♪

25:49.798 --> 25:53.468
- THIS WEEK WE ASKED YOU
TO SHOW PERFECT PLACEMENT

25:53.551 --> 25:55.011
WITH AN AQUATIC TATTOO.

25:55.095 --> 25:59.349
SCOTT, YOU'RE UP FIRST.

25:59.432 --> 26:00.267
- MAN, I LOVE THIS TATTOO.

26:00.350 --> 26:02.978
THE PLACEMENT IS JUST RIGHT.

26:03.061 --> 26:04.479
WHAT I LIKE THE MOST ABOUT HOW
IT FITS THE BODY

26:04.562 --> 26:07.774
IS HOW SOFT THE EDGES
OF THE DESIGN ARE.

26:07.857 --> 26:09.651
IT'S A DELICATE,
BEAUTIFUL TATTOO.

26:09.734 --> 26:11.987
BUT IT'S ALSO TOUGH AND BADASS.

26:12.070 --> 26:15.824
- I LOVE THE DARK RINGS THAT YOU
DO THROUGH THE BACKGROUND.

26:15.907 --> 26:17.701
THIS IS NOT SENSELESS
BACKGROUND.

26:17.784 --> 26:19.369
THIS IS BACKGROUND
THAT MEANS SOMETHING.

26:19.452 --> 26:21.621
AND THIS IS A TATTOO THAT WE
LOVE TO SEE COME OUT

26:21.705 --> 26:22.747
OF <i> INK MASTER.</i>

26:22.831 --> 26:25.834
- THANK YOU.

26:25.917 --> 26:29.296
- MATTI.

26:29.379 --> 26:31.339
- THIS IS
A VERY BIG, BOLD TATTOO.

26:31.423 --> 26:33.967
MY ONLY REAL COMPLAINT WAS
THE BIG AREA OF BLACK

26:34.050 --> 26:35.343
ABOVE THE WHALE.

26:35.427 --> 26:36.428
I WISH YOU WOULD'VE
BROKEN THAT UP

26:36.511 --> 26:37.971
WITH A COUPLE OF LAYERS
OF CLOUDS.

26:38.054 --> 26:41.224
- BUT OVERALL, BEAUTIFUL LINES,
BEAUTIFUL SHADING,

26:41.308 --> 26:42.851
BEAUTIFUL, TRADITIONAL STYLE.

26:42.934 --> 26:47.355
THIS TATTOO IS VERY NICE, MAN.
- THANK YOU.

26:47.439 --> 26:49.899
- KYLE.

26:49.983 --> 26:51.985
- I FEEL LIKE THE TURTLE,
THE DETAIL IS UNBELIEVABLE.

26:52.068 --> 26:56.281
I JUST THINK IT COULD'VE USED
MORE DETAIL AROUND THE TURTLE.

26:56.364 --> 26:58.241
- YOUR FISH AT THE BOTTOM,
NO DETAIL.

26:58.325 --> 27:00.618
THE CORAL HAS
VERY LITTLE DETAIL.

27:00.702 --> 27:01.828
THE WHOLE PERIMETER OF THE
DESIGN HAS VERY LITTLE DETAIL.

27:01.911 --> 27:05.415
DECISIONS YOU MADE LEFT YOU
UNFINISHED AT THE BOTTOM.

27:05.498 --> 27:07.584
- IT'S JUST MEDIOCRE TATTOOING.

27:07.667 --> 27:10.128
- I LIKE THE PIECE.
I THINK I'M IN THE TOP FIVE.

27:10.211 --> 27:11.046
- WITH THIS?

27:11.129 --> 27:12.005
- AND I'M DOING BETTER
THAN LAST SEASON.

27:12.088 --> 27:13.423
- WITH THIS, YOU'RE NOT
IN THE TOP FIVE.

27:13.506 --> 27:14.632
YOU'RE JUST IN THE MIDDLE, MAN.

27:14.716 --> 27:16.217
IS YOUR COLOR AS SOLID
AS SCOTT'S?

27:16.301 --> 27:18.219
IS YOUR OUTLINE AS SOLID
AS SCOTT'S?

27:18.303 --> 27:19.095
- YES.
MY OUTLINE'S DEFINITELY--

27:19.179 --> 27:20.638
- NO.
- NO.

27:20.722 --> 27:23.308
DID YOU TATTOO AS BOLD AS MATTI?
DOES IT JUMP OFF THE SKIN?

27:23.391 --> 27:24.642
DOES IT LOOK LIKE--

27:24.726 --> 27:26.186
- ARE WE COMPARING A [bleep]
REALISTIC TATTOO

27:26.269 --> 27:27.979
TO AN OLD-SCHOOL,
TRADITIONAL PIECE?

27:28.063 --> 27:29.481
- WE'RE COMPARING TECHNIQUE
TO TECHNIQUE

27:29.564 --> 27:30.398
AND TATTOOER TO TATTOOER.

27:30.482 --> 27:33.485
YOU'RE FALLING SHORT, BUD.

27:36.863 --> 27:38.073
- JIM.

27:38.156 --> 27:39.199
- THIS IS
A VERY TECHNICAL TATTOO.

27:39.282 --> 27:41.534
IT'S A VERY NICE DRAWING.

27:41.618 --> 27:43.078
ALL OF THE LITTLE SPOTS
WHERE YOU LET YOUR LINE BREAK

27:43.161 --> 27:44.746
FOR THOSE HIGHLIGHTS
LOOKS SUPER CLEAN.

27:44.829 --> 27:49.084
THOSE SMALL, LITTLE TOUCHES
JUST SHOW EXPERIENCE.

27:49.167 --> 27:51.795
- THANKS, GUYS.

27:51.878 --> 27:54.464
- HALO.

27:54.547 --> 27:55.757
- THIS THING IS JUST
A BIG SHAPE.

27:55.840 --> 27:58.593
IT'S NOT SOMETHING
THAT FLOWS WITH THE BODY.

27:58.676 --> 28:00.678
- I TRIED TO DO MY BEST
WITH WHAT I WAS GIVEN.

28:00.762 --> 28:01.554
- THE THING THAT TROUBLES ME
ON THIS TATTOO, MAN,

28:01.638 --> 28:04.599
THERE'S A LOT OF BAD OUTLINES
IN IT.

28:04.682 --> 28:06.851
- SHE WAS TALKING AND MOVING
NO MATTER WHAT I SAID.

28:06.935 --> 28:08.311
- THIS IS COOKIE-CUTTER
BULL[bleep].

28:08.395 --> 28:11.147
YOU MADE YOURSELF LOOK
LIKE YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO DRAW.

28:11.231 --> 28:12.273
IF YOU'RE GONNA STAY
IN THIS COMPETITION,

28:12.357 --> 28:17.362
DON'T PUT YOURSELF IN THE MIDDLE
WHEN YOU'RE A TOP.

28:17.445 --> 28:19.823
- MELISSA.

28:19.906 --> 28:21.783
- WHAT I FIND WEIRD
ABOUT THIS TATTOO

28:21.866 --> 28:22.951
IS JUST THE COLOR PALETTE.

28:23.034 --> 28:24.953
IT DOESN'T END UP BEING
A VIBRANT TATTOO.

28:25.036 --> 28:28.498
- SHE VERY SPECIFICALLY
DID NOT WANT A BRIGHT MERMAID.

28:28.581 --> 28:31.042
SHE DIDN'T WANT
A PRETTY MERMAID AT ALL.

28:31.126 --> 28:32.877
- SO THE GOAL WAS
TO NOT MAKE A PRETTY FACE?

28:32.961 --> 28:34.212
- THAT FACE
IS TEN TIMES PRETTIER

28:34.295 --> 28:35.839
THAN SHE ORIGINALLY WANTED.

28:35.922 --> 28:39.050
- THIS FACE, THESE FINGERS,
THE STATIC HAIR,

28:39.134 --> 28:42.345
THESE ARE YOUR MOMENTS
TO EITHER SHINE OR NOT SHINE.

28:42.429 --> 28:46.975
YOU'RE NOT SHINING IN HERE.

28:47.058 --> 28:48.393
- KEITH.

28:48.476 --> 28:51.146
- IT'S A COOL, TRADITIONAL TAKE
ON THIS IMAGE.

28:51.229 --> 28:54.482
BUT THE WAY YOU CHOSE TO SHADE
THIS, THE TONE OF THE ANCHOR

28:54.566 --> 28:56.484
AND THE TONE OF THE EEL
BEING THE SAME DARKNESS,

28:56.568 --> 28:57.819
IT IS HARD TO READ.

28:57.902 --> 28:58.445
- JUST WANTED TO DO,
LIKE, JUST ONE TONE

28:58.528 --> 28:59.654
AND NOT, LIKE, OVERDO IT.

28:59.737 --> 29:01.489
- YOU GOT THE WORST TATTOO
OF THE DAY? NO.

29:01.573 --> 29:04.325
COULD IT BE BETTER?
[bleep], YEAH.

29:04.409 --> 29:08.538
IT COULD BE A LOT BETTER.

29:08.621 --> 29:10.748
- KING.

29:10.832 --> 29:13.960
OBVIOUSLY, THESE ARE
TWO AQUATIC CREATURES.

29:14.043 --> 29:15.712
BUT THERE'S NOTHING ELSE
IN THE TATTOO

29:15.795 --> 29:17.714
THAT SHOWS THAT THIS
IS HAPPENING UNDERWATER.

29:17.797 --> 29:20.550
- I DIDN'T WANT TO PUT
A WHOLE LOT OF DETAIL.

29:20.633 --> 29:22.343
I'VE SEEN DIFFERENT ARTISTS TRY
TO DO MORE,

29:22.427 --> 29:23.970
AND THEY GET DOCKED FOR IT.

29:24.053 --> 29:25.180
- I FEEL LIKE YOU PLAYED IT
TOO SAFE.

29:25.263 --> 29:27.265
- I'D RATHER PLAY SAFE
THAN SORRY.

29:27.348 --> 29:29.934
- BEING IN THE MIDDLE AIN'T
GONNA TAKE IT TO THE END.

29:30.018 --> 29:33.646
YOU'VE GOT TO TIGHTEN IT UP.

29:33.730 --> 29:35.857
- ROLAND.

29:35.940 --> 29:38.318
- I LOOK AT YOUR TATTOO,
AND YOU'VE GOT COLORS

29:38.401 --> 29:39.819
THAT JUST AREN'T SOLID.

29:39.903 --> 29:41.362
YOU'VE GOT BLENDS
THAT JUST AREN'T SMOOTH.

29:41.446 --> 29:44.032
- YOU KIND OF JUST PUT
THE GROUPER AT THE BOTTOM.

29:44.115 --> 29:45.867
AND YOU LEFT A LOT OF AREA OPEN.

29:45.950 --> 29:47.368
I JUST FEEL LIKE IT
WAS JUST UNFINISHED.

29:47.452 --> 29:49.454
- THIS TATTOO IS BY NO MEANS
A WINNER TODAY.

29:49.537 --> 29:51.706
BUT YOU HAVE IMPROVED.

29:51.789 --> 29:55.043
AND FOR THAT, I DO COMMEND YOU.

29:55.126 --> 29:56.044
- LYDIA.

29:56.127 --> 29:58.922
- THE PLACEMENT OF THE FISH
ITSELF, I LIKE.

29:59.005 --> 30:01.883
JUST HOW YOU TRAPPED IT IN
WITH THAT SOLID, DARK SHAPE,

30:01.966 --> 30:03.426
IT DOESN'T REALLY FIT
THE BODY.

30:03.510 --> 30:05.512
- I TRIED TO CREATE MOTION,
AND IT WAS HARD

30:05.595 --> 30:06.888
TO PLACE THIS TATTOO.

30:06.971 --> 30:08.640
- WATER'S A LOOSE,
ORGANIC THING.

30:08.723 --> 30:10.225
LET IT BE A MORE FREE-FORM
TATTOO.

30:10.308 --> 30:14.896
IT WOULD'VE FLOWED
WITH THE BODY EASIER.

30:14.979 --> 30:15.605
- JAY.

30:15.688 --> 30:18.233
- YOU DID A MASSIVE TATTOO, MAN.

30:18.316 --> 30:21.069
WHAT I DON'T LIKE
IS THAT YOU TOOK MY EYE AWAY

30:21.152 --> 30:23.947
FROM ALL YOUR HARD WORK
WITH THE STRIPES

30:24.030 --> 30:25.573
AND THE WEIRD BACKGROUND.

30:25.657 --> 30:27.075
- ALL THIS BLACK BACKGROUND
EATS UP A LOT OF TIME.

30:27.158 --> 30:30.537
- IT'S THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN,
AND THAT'S A REALLY DARK PLACE.

30:30.620 --> 30:32.497
- IF YOU WERE TO USE YOUR TIME
MORE WISELY,

30:32.580 --> 30:34.249
THE NOSE OF THE SHIP
AND THE WOODWORK

30:34.332 --> 30:34.791
COULD'VE BEEN TRICKED OUT
JUST AS NICELY

30:34.874 --> 30:36.084
AS YOU DID THAT CHEST.

30:36.167 --> 30:38.920
THAT'S THE STUFF THAT'S GONNA
MAKE THIS TATTOO REALLY STAND

30:39.003 --> 30:42.131
ABOVE EVERYBODY ELSE'S.

30:42.215 --> 30:43.550
- BUBBA.

30:43.633 --> 30:46.219
- I THOUGHT POSEIDON
WAS A DOPE TATTOO TO GET.

30:46.302 --> 30:49.013
BUT THE CARRIAGE TOOK OVER
THE TATTOO MORE THAN POSEIDON.

30:49.097 --> 30:50.598
IF THAT WOULD'VE BEEN
MORE PREVALENT,

30:50.682 --> 30:51.516
I THINK IT WOULD'VE BEEN
A LITTLE BETTER.

30:51.599 --> 30:54.435
- JUST A BLOWN ATTEMPT
AT A GREAT TATTOO.

30:54.519 --> 30:56.688
YOU'RE DRAWING AGAINST EVERYONE.

30:56.771 --> 30:58.565
AND IF YOUR DRAWING
COMES UP SHORT,

30:58.648 --> 31:03.361
IT'S NOT GONNA KEEP YOU HERE.

31:03.444 --> 31:04.279
- SAUSAGE.

31:04.362 --> 31:06.614
HOW WAS IT,
WORKING WITH YOUR CLIENT?

31:06.698 --> 31:07.740
- IT WAS TOUGH.

31:07.824 --> 31:10.410
I REALLY HAD TO USE A LOT
OF DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES

31:10.493 --> 31:11.869
TO TRY TO GET HIM TO TRUST ME.

31:11.953 --> 31:13.621
- BEING A CLIENT, I GO IN
WITH A LOT OF IDEAS.

31:13.705 --> 31:16.332
AND I WOULD WANT THE TATTOO
ARTIST TO BE ABLE TO TALK TO ME

31:16.416 --> 31:18.376
AND TELL ME,
"HEY, THAT DON'T LOOK RIGHT."

31:18.459 --> 31:19.502
BUT I THINK THIS
TATTOO IS AWESOME.

31:19.586 --> 31:22.547
- YOU CAPTURED AN AMAZING
DRAWING OUT OF THE GATE.

31:22.630 --> 31:23.881
WAY TO REALLY BE AN ARTIST.

31:23.965 --> 31:25.508
- DETAILS ARE GREAT.
PLACEMENT IS GREAT.

31:25.592 --> 31:27.969
NOT JUST PLACEMENT ON THE BODY,

31:28.052 --> 31:30.972
BUT PLACEMENT OF THE SMALLER
ELEMENTS WITHIN THE TATTOO.

31:31.055 --> 31:31.472
SUPER COOL, MAN.

31:31.556 --> 31:35.310
- THANK YOU ALL, GUYS.

31:35.393 --> 31:37.729
- RANDY.

31:37.812 --> 31:39.480
- THIS THING IS ROUGH.

31:39.564 --> 31:43.234
WHAT LITTLE OUTLINE THERE IS,
IS VERY, VERY WEAK.

31:43.318 --> 31:47.071
THE MASSIVE FIELDS OF COLOR
ARE NOT SATURATED.

31:47.155 --> 31:48.906
- IT IS SATURATED,
AND I WILL STAND BY THAT.

31:48.990 --> 31:51.451
- WE'RE NOT SAYING THIS FOOL
ISN'T BLUE NOW.

31:51.534 --> 31:53.036
ANYBODY CAN SEE THAT THERE IS
BLUE THERE,

31:53.119 --> 31:55.038
BUT WHEN I SAY THE WORD
"SATURATED," I MEAN,

31:55.121 --> 31:58.249
"WHEN THIS HEALS, THAT COLOR
IS GONNA BE SMOOTH AND EVEN."

31:58.333 --> 32:00.877
THERE'S JUST NO CHANCE THAT
THAT IS WHAT YOU HAVE HERE.

32:00.960 --> 32:03.671
- I MEAN, I CAN'T EVEN SAY
THE WHALE LOOKS COOL.

32:03.755 --> 32:06.841
IT LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING
ONE OF MY KIDS WOULD DRAW.

32:06.924 --> 32:08.259
- LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING
ABOUT ME.

32:08.343 --> 32:11.179
WHEN I STARTED TATTOOING,
I WAS 30 YEARS OLD, OKAY?

32:11.262 --> 32:11.679
- BUT THIS ISN'T
ABOUT YOUR HISTORY, BRO.

32:11.763 --> 32:12.680
- LISTEN--NO, IT IS.

32:12.764 --> 32:14.849
- IT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH HISTORY.

32:14.932 --> 32:16.351
THIS HAS TO DO
WITH WHAT'S ON THE SCREEN.

32:16.434 --> 32:19.520
- I CAN'T GO INTO A SHOP
AS A 30-YEAR-OLD HOMOSEXUAL

32:19.604 --> 32:21.856
AND GET ANY SORT OF RESPECT
FROM ANYBODY.

32:21.939 --> 32:22.815
- MAN, WHO GIVES A [bleep] WHAT
YOU DO IN YOUR PRIVATE LIFE?

32:22.899 --> 32:24.275
- IT DOES, CHRIS.
LET ME TELL YOU.

32:24.359 --> 32:26.861
- YOU CAN BE WHATEVER YOU WANT,
AND YOU SHOULD BE PROUD OF THAT.

32:26.944 --> 32:28.321
- AND I WILL BE.

32:28.404 --> 32:30.198
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET BASHED
FOR YOUR SEXUAL PREFERENCE.

32:30.281 --> 32:34.118
YOU'RE ONLY GONNA GET BASHED
FOR THE QUALITY OF YOUR CRAFT.

32:40.083 --> 32:42.627
- BEFORE WE SEND YOU BACK
TO THE LOFT,

32:42.710 --> 32:45.713
THE JUDGES HAVE DETERMINED
A WINNER.

32:45.797 --> 32:48.508
MATTI...

32:48.591 --> 32:51.219
SCOTT...

32:51.302 --> 32:54.222
AND SAUSAGE...

32:54.305 --> 32:58.226
THE THREE OF YOU HAVE
THE TOP TATTOOS OF THE DAY.

32:58.309 --> 33:02.438
THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED
THE BEST TATTOO OF THE DAY...

33:04.565 --> 33:07.568
GOES TO SCOTT.

33:07.652 --> 33:08.903
- THE ONE THING I LOVE
ABOUT THIS TATTOO IS

33:08.986 --> 33:11.072
IT'S SHOWING
A LITTLE BIT MORE VERSATILITY

33:11.155 --> 33:12.448
IN YOUR TATTOOS, MAN.

33:12.532 --> 33:13.408
IF YOU CAN KEEP RIDING
THE WAY YOU'RE GOING NOW, MAN,

33:13.491 --> 33:14.575
IT'S GONNA BE BADASS.

33:14.659 --> 33:16.661
- CONGRATULATIONS, SCOTT.

33:16.744 --> 33:17.745
YOU NOW HAVE THE POWER

33:17.829 --> 33:20.081
TO PUT THE ARTIST
YOU THINK HAS THE WORST TATTOO

33:20.164 --> 33:21.332
UP FOR ELIMINATION.

33:21.416 --> 33:25.169
AND THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY
IS DELIBERATING RIGHT NOW.

33:25.253 --> 33:28.506
THEIR VOTE WILL ALSO PUT
ONE OF YOU UP FOR ELIMINATION.

33:28.589 --> 33:29.507
HEAD BACK TO THE LOFT,

33:29.590 --> 33:31.092
AND WE'LL CALL YOU
WHEN WE HAVE A DECISION.

33:41.686 --> 33:44.397
- THEY'RE [bleep] ASS[bleep].

33:44.480 --> 33:46.441
- I CAN'T [bleep] GET OVER THAT.

33:46.524 --> 33:47.525
- WE'VE ALL HAD HARDSHIPS

33:47.608 --> 33:49.026
COMING THROUGH
THIS INDUSTRY, MAN.

33:49.110 --> 33:50.027
AND IF YOU'RE DOWN THERE,
AND YOU'RE GETTING SLAMMED

33:50.111 --> 33:52.029
BY THE JUDGES,
YOU CAN'T START CRYING

33:52.113 --> 33:53.531
OR PLAYING THE RACE CARD
OR YOUR SEX CARD

33:53.614 --> 33:54.699
OR WHATEVER IT IS.

33:54.782 --> 33:57.034
JUST OWN YOUR TATTOO, MAN.
OWN IT.

33:57.118 --> 33:58.244
RANDY'S TATTOO WASN'T GOOD.

33:58.327 --> 34:01.247
AND NOW HE'S LETTING HIS
EMOTIONS GET THE BEST OF HIM.

34:01.330 --> 34:05.126
{\an8}BUT I'M GONNA HAVE TO SEND DOWN
THE WORST PIECE REGARDLESS.

34:05.209 --> 34:09.338
I JUST DON'T SEE RANDY'S HEART
IN THIS FIGHT.

34:09.422 --> 34:10.465
- CAN I INTERJECT SOMETHING?

34:10.547 --> 34:12.216
I JUST WANTED TO TELL YOU,
SCOTT,

34:12.300 --> 34:14.342
WHETHER YOU SEND ME DOWN OR NOT,

34:14.427 --> 34:15.636
I WANT YOU TO SEND ME DOWN

34:15.719 --> 34:17.972
BECAUSE YOU THINK
I DID A BAD TATTOO,

34:18.056 --> 34:20.683
NOT BECAUSE YOU FEEL LIKE
I PACKED IT IN.

34:20.766 --> 34:23.018
I'M NOT READY TO LEAVE.

34:23.101 --> 34:24.812
- [sighs]

34:35.406 --> 34:36.699
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
TODAY WE HAD AQUATIC TATTOOS.

34:36.783 --> 34:39.327
WE WERE FOCUSING ON PLACEMENT.

34:39.409 --> 34:41.996
LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT
WHO MISSED THE MARK TODAY.

34:42.079 --> 34:43.121
KING RUCK.

34:43.206 --> 34:45.291
- AS FAR AS AQUATIC,
IT'S JUST A SHARK.

34:45.373 --> 34:46.292
THERE'S NO SCENE.

34:46.375 --> 34:47.918
AND THE PLACEMENT
IS KIND OF OFF.

34:48.002 --> 34:49.378
- THE BLACK SHADING,

34:49.462 --> 34:50.254
IT'S GOT A LOT OF PROBLEMS.

34:50.338 --> 34:52.632
- RANDY DID THE SQUID
AND THE WHALE.

34:52.715 --> 34:54.926
- THIS LOOKS
LIKE A CRAYOLA SCRIBBLE.

34:55.009 --> 34:56.219
THERE'S NO REDEEMING QUALITY
TO IT.

34:56.302 --> 34:59.639
AND IF I DON'T SAY THIS IS CRAP,
THEN I'M AN IDIOT.

34:59.722 --> 35:01.808
I'LL BE DAMNED
IF I'M GONNA BE THE IDIOT.

35:01.891 --> 35:03.351
- BUBBA DID POSEIDON.

35:03.434 --> 35:06.687
THESE SEA HORSES, UNLESS
THEY TOOK SOME CRAZY LEFT TURN,

35:06.771 --> 35:09.398
THAT SLED IS NOT EVEN

35:09.482 --> 35:11.108
IN THE SAME DIRECTION
OF THE FLOW.

35:11.192 --> 35:14.403
- THIS? IT'S JUST
A JACKED-UP COMPOSITION.

35:14.487 --> 35:17.532
- ANOTHER ARTIST CONSISTENTLY
IN THE BOTTOM: ROLAND.

35:17.615 --> 35:19.033
- I JUST FELT LIKE
IT WAS UNFINISHED.

35:19.116 --> 35:22.078
THAT'S WHY YOU GET THE EMPTINESS
UP AT 2/3 OF THE TATTOO.

35:22.161 --> 35:23.621
- WHETHER WE LIKE THIS TATTOO
OR NOT,

35:23.704 --> 35:26.332
THE LOWER PORTION OF THIS TATTOO
HAS OUTLINE,

35:26.415 --> 35:28.876
IT HAS SHADING,
AND IT HAS SOLID COLOR.

35:28.960 --> 35:30.419
THIS IS HIS BEST,
AND HE DELIVERED IT.

35:30.503 --> 35:31.712
- BUT IT WASN'T DONE, THOUGH.

35:31.796 --> 35:34.465
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
THE INTERESTING THING RIGHT NOW

35:34.549 --> 35:39.053
IS GONNA BE HEARING WHAT THE
HUMAN CANVAS JURY HAS TO SAY.

35:39.136 --> 35:41.097
{\an8}- SO WE'RE HERE TO DECIDE WHO
HAD THE WORST TATTOO OF THE DAY.

35:41.180 --> 35:44.934
- THIS IS MY TATTOO,
AND MY ARTIST WAS BUBBA.

35:45.017 --> 35:46.477
- THEY'RE SHARING A MIDDLE LEG.

35:46.561 --> 35:47.562
- IT'S HARD TO READ IT,
BUT IT'S THE SHADOW BEHIND IT.

35:47.645 --> 35:50.731
AND THE HORSES AREN'T SUPPOSED
TO BE SYMMETRICAL.

35:50.815 --> 35:51.607
THEY'RE HORSES.

35:51.691 --> 35:52.900
HORSES ARE DIFFERENT
FROM EACH OTHER.

35:52.984 --> 35:54.277
- THE PROPORTIONS, THOUGH,

35:54.360 --> 35:55.194
IT LOOKS LIKE THE CHARIOT'S
FACING, LIKE, ONE WAY,

35:55.278 --> 35:56.988
AND THE HORSES ARE GOING
ANOTHER WAY.

35:57.071 --> 35:59.240
- IF YOU'RE UNDERWATER,
MAKING A TURN,

35:59.323 --> 36:01.117
IT'S GONNA KIND OF SWING
LIKE THAT.

36:01.200 --> 36:03.578
WE WERE LIMITED
ON OUR PLACEMENT.

36:03.661 --> 36:05.538
AND I THINK HE DID A GOOD JOB.

36:05.621 --> 36:08.916
- THIS IS MY TATTOO.
MY ARTIST WAS KING RUCK.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.209
- I KNOW IT'S A SHARK.
BUT IT'S DEFORMED.

36:10.293 --> 36:13.421
GILLS ON A SHARK
ARE TECHNICALLY OVER HERE.

36:13.504 --> 36:14.338

OF A WRINKLE,

36:14.422 --> 36:16.549
'CAUSE HIS HEAD'S
KIND OF TILTED BACK.

36:16.632 --> 36:17.550
ALSO, IT LOOKS LIKE
THE TAIL'S GOING LIKE THIS,

36:17.633 --> 36:19.594
LIKE A MAMMAL,
INSTEAD OF A FISH, LIKE THIS.

36:19.677 --> 36:21.596
- I'M HAPPY WITH IT.
I THINK IT LOOKS COOL.

36:21.679 --> 36:23.389
AND I GOT WHAT I WANTED.

36:23.472 --> 36:26.142
- THAT'S ME.
MY ARTIST WAS ROLAND.

36:26.225 --> 36:28.686
HE GOT A LOT OF COLOR IN THERE,
WHICH IS WHAT I WANTED.

36:28.769 --> 36:30.271
- IT HONESTLY LOOKS LIKE
A KID COLORED IT IN.

36:30.354 --> 36:32.481
- IT DOESN'T READ AS, LIKE,
TROPICAL AND BRIGHT.

36:32.565 --> 36:35.735
- I THINK THAT I COULD ALWAYS
ADD ON TO THIS.

36:35.818 --> 36:37.737
BUT WITH THE SHARK,
HOW DO YOU FIX WRONG PLACEMENT

36:37.820 --> 36:39.405
