E. R.

00:05.102 --> 00:06.332
Previously on E. R.

00:06.433 --> 00:09.415
- What do you want me to call you?
- How about introducing me as "Abby"?

00:09.616 --> 00:11.442
You don't want people to know
we're going out.

00:11.543 --> 00:14.122
- I'm Dr. Pratt.
- Olivia Evans. I'm with Ceasefire.

00:14.223 --> 00:16.053
- Ceasefire?
- Violence prevention program.

00:16.154 --> 00:17.278
What's she like?

00:17.335 --> 00:19.492
She's a health professional, Ray.
Don't be such a dog.

00:19.593 --> 00:20.535
Where did this happen?

00:20.636 --> 00:22.160
- Twenty-third.
- Wabash.

00:22.661 --> 00:24.531
Well, it- It was near the corner.

00:24.732 --> 00:26.940
- Did you file a police report?
- What's the point?

00:27.041 --> 00:30.263
She and her sister panhandle on Wabash.
I give them a buck once in a while.

00:30.364 --> 00:32.658
I need this publication
for my Chief Resident application.

00:32.759 --> 00:35.320
Trust me. It's gonna take
a hell of a lot more than that.

00:37.020 --> 00:39.940
E. R. 11x19 "RUDY REDUX"
SubtÃ­tulos subXpacio

00:41.733 --> 00:45.570
Yeah, I called Sid. And, no, he doesn't
have anything new to show us.

00:45.737 --> 00:47.990
We need a new realtor.
He's shown us 17 houses...

00:48.157 --> 00:51.077
- ...not one of them close.
- Don't think the problem could be us?

00:51.243 --> 00:53.287
All right, what about this one? No.

00:53.454 --> 00:55.581
It doesn't seem fair
to schedule it like that.

00:55.748 --> 00:59.294
You work all night, now you gotta
rush back. You're tired.

00:59.461 --> 01:01.922
What do you mean, I'm tired?
Do I look like I'm tired?

01:03.632 --> 01:05.801
Of course not. No.
You look chipper. It's just-

01:05.968 --> 01:08.720
- Smoodge.
- You're just- You're worrying so much.

01:08.887 --> 01:12.058
You know, they don't schedule
tenure meetings around the candidates.

01:12.225 --> 01:14.352
Hey, at least you're overthinking
the wardrobe.

01:14.519 --> 01:17.438
I am not worrying.
And I am not overthinking.

01:17.605 --> 01:19.941
You know, tenure
means financial security.

01:20.108 --> 01:23.404
We could get a house,
start a college fund for Cosmo.

01:23.570 --> 01:25.572
What if Cosmo doesn't
want to go to college?

01:25.739 --> 01:28.701
- What?
- Baby, I can go back to work.

01:30.619 --> 01:33.164
- I know.
- You can make more at a private hospital.

01:33.331 --> 01:36.167
No. It's not about the money.
I want to be at County.

01:36.334 --> 01:38.128
It's where I belong.

01:38.294 --> 01:41.715
Okay. I'm gonna leave these here.
Promise me you'll step over them.

01:41.881 --> 01:44.677
- I promise.
- All right. I gotta go, baby.

01:44.844 --> 01:48.264
I love you. And you too.

01:48.639 --> 01:51.892
- Oh, Susan.
- I have one meeting, then I will be home.

01:52.059 --> 01:53.394
- Susan.
- How do I look?

01:53.561 --> 01:55.313
You look great except just:

02:03.947 --> 02:05.658
- Who are you?
- I'm Dr. Rasgotra.

02:05.825 --> 02:08.369
You're a doctor?
You got a high school diploma?

02:08.536 --> 02:09.829
Eighty-five, fainted.

02:09.996 --> 02:13.583
- I did not faint. I was tripped.
- It was witnessed.

02:13.749 --> 02:16.085
Syncopal event at his club.
Unconscious 30 seconds.

02:16.252 --> 02:18.464
Who told you that? Those old geezers?

02:18.630 --> 02:20.674
They're unconscious most of the day.

02:20.841 --> 02:23.093
- Must've been a long ride.
- Oh, tell me about it.

02:23.260 --> 02:25.053
Get out of here! Bring back the omelet!

02:25.220 --> 02:26.972
- Okay, we'll see what we can do.
- Now!

02:27.139 --> 02:29.267
Delirium, tachycardia,
hyperthermia, mydriasis.

02:29.434 --> 02:31.352
- Better not have spinach!
- What do you think?

02:31.519 --> 02:33.396
Don't get high by snorting
antihistamines?

02:33.563 --> 02:34.606
I hate spinach.

02:35.398 --> 02:38.526
Come on, guys. This is classic.
Mad as a hatter, red as a beet...

02:38.694 --> 02:40.696
- Dry as a bone.
- Anticholinergic toxicity.

02:40.863 --> 02:42.656
Bingo. What's your plan?

02:42.823 --> 02:45.326
IV, tox screen, activated charcoal.

02:45.493 --> 02:48.579
- Yes. What else?
- EKG, rule out cardiac effects.

02:48.746 --> 02:50.999
- Ativan for the agitation.
- Excellent.

02:51.166 --> 02:55.378
And what happens if the delirium
worsens despite benzos?

02:57.047 --> 03:00.467
Physostigmine. The only
acetylcholinesterase inhibitor...

03:00.634 --> 03:03.471
...that crosses the blood-brain barrier.
Everybody get that?

03:03.638 --> 03:05.473
Where do I sign to get out of here?

03:05.640 --> 03:07.058
We need to examine you first.

03:07.225 --> 03:10.394
If I wanted help, I wouldn't
come to this place looking for it.

03:10.561 --> 03:13.232
- I want another hospital.
- We're just gonna check you out.

03:13.398 --> 03:15.943
- I don't want this place.
- It won't take long.

03:16.109 --> 03:18.654
- I don't want your doctors.
- Dr. Carter, we need you.

03:18.820 --> 03:20.656
- Okay.
- Especially that one.

03:20.822 --> 03:24.577
I don't want that one
anywhere near me.

03:24.744 --> 03:26.246
He killed my wife.

03:28.000 --> 03:34.074

04:24.434 --> 04:26.310
Sam, what's the deal
with my lymphoma guy?

04:26.477 --> 04:28.271
CT was ready for him 40 minutes ago.

04:28.438 --> 04:30.315
Man, I totally spaced. I'll go take him.

04:30.482 --> 04:33.694
Don't bother. They got a seizing
ICU player. Be backed up a while.

04:33.861 --> 04:35.362
Okay.

04:35.529 --> 04:37.906
- Crap. Sorry.
- That was the Guatemalan blend.

04:38.073 --> 04:40.284
- I said sorry.
- Come on. Let's move some bodies.

04:40.451 --> 04:42.829
Transfer from Seashore House,
fever and incontinence.

04:42.996 --> 04:46.666
I got stuck with the last dump.
Abby, I'll trade you. Whatever you get.

04:46.833 --> 04:49.836
- No, Ray. I don't think so.
- Neela, 85-year-old man with syncope.

04:50.003 --> 04:52.590
- The one you brought in.
- The guy that yelled at Carter?

04:52.757 --> 04:56.218
Afraid so. And as much as I hate
doing this to you, I'm out of here.

04:57.303 --> 04:59.013
Exam 3.

05:00.264 --> 05:03.935
I've served on the curriculum and
admissions committees for three years.

05:04.102 --> 05:07.481
And we appreciate that. We're also
looking for excellence in teaching.

05:07.647 --> 05:10.484
You've won the Resident
teaching award three years running.

05:10.650 --> 05:13.195
- That's very impressive.
- Seven years as an Attending...

05:13.361 --> 05:16.365
- ...only four publications?
- No original research? First author?

05:16.532 --> 05:19.702
I just submitted a review article.
And I have other studies lined up.

05:19.869 --> 05:23.372
- I'm waiting to hear about the grants.
- Emergency medicine's a smorgasbord.

05:23.539 --> 05:25.583
Sometimes it's hard to find your niche.

05:26.293 --> 05:27.669
Excuse me?

05:28.545 --> 05:31.965
The university is willing to float
junior faculty for a few years. But-

05:32.132 --> 05:35.010
Tenured Attendings need
the ability to carry their own weight.

05:35.177 --> 05:38.515
You mean, bring in grant money.
Okay, my focus hasn't been research.

05:38.681 --> 05:41.976
I've spent the last seven years
becoming a good clinician and teacher.

05:42.143 --> 05:46.231
That's clear, Susan. And we put
a great deal of value on that.

05:47.941 --> 05:52.029
Well, I don't want you to do anything
until I can talk to my own doctor...

05:52.196 --> 05:55.658
- ...Stanley Obermeyer.
- Right. We have a call in to him.

05:55.824 --> 05:59.621
Yeah? Well, Stanley's not gonna like what
you guys are doing, prodding me here.

05:59.788 --> 06:02.040
Mr. Rubadoux, I can't hear
while you're talking.

06:02.207 --> 06:05.585
- You've been listening for 5 minutes.
- You've been talking for 5 minutes.

06:10.090 --> 06:12.510
- Anyone ever tell you you have a murmur?
- A what?

06:12.677 --> 06:15.263
A murmur? The sound of blood
rushing through the heart.

06:16.347 --> 06:18.849
- You think I have that?
- I'm pretty sure, yeah.

06:19.016 --> 06:22.563
Oh, "pretty sure"?
Is that all you can say?

06:22.729 --> 06:23.939
I'd like to run some tests.

06:24.106 --> 06:27.192
- What tests?
- EKG, chest x-ray.

06:27.359 --> 06:28.902
Draw some blood.

06:29.069 --> 06:33.533
Look, no offense, but I don't want
some nurse calling the shots around here.

06:33.700 --> 06:37.787
Mr. Rubadoux, I am not a nurse.
I am a doctor.

06:37.954 --> 06:39.872
Well, you're not my doctor.

06:40.039 --> 06:44.044
And I'm not gonna let you
do anything else until I talk to him.

06:44.211 --> 06:46.422
- Okay.
- Okay.

06:53.220 --> 06:54.263
Jeez.

06:54.430 --> 06:57.767
- I'm Dr. Pratt. Take a deep breath for me.
- Sats 88 on a nonrebreather.

06:57.934 --> 07:01.313
- Is he dead? Is my husband dead?
- Behind us. Doctors are working on him.

07:01.479 --> 07:02.647
He's alive?

07:03.064 --> 07:05.150
Wife fired a couple of rounds
to his chest.

07:05.317 --> 07:08.112
Pulse at 133, BP, 90 palp,
went apneic in the rig.

07:08.279 --> 07:10.531
- Access?
- Two large-bore IVs. Liter en route.

07:10.698 --> 07:14.785
- Another day, another happy couple.
- All right, on my count: One, two, three.

07:14.952 --> 07:17.497
- Two of Versed right away.
- Your husband stabbed you?

07:17.664 --> 07:20.751
He cornered me in the kitchen,
had a knife to my throat.

07:20.917 --> 07:23.503
- Definite ETOH.
- Have you been drinking, Mrs. Casey?

07:23.670 --> 07:26.631
I didn't know what to do.
I grabbed his gun from the kitchen.

07:26.798 --> 07:30.511
Decreased breath sounds. You have
a collapsed lung. I need to reinflate it.

07:30.678 --> 07:33.139
Sam, you were supposed to check
the airway boxes.

07:33.306 --> 07:35.433
- I don't think so.
- According to the schedule.

07:35.600 --> 07:38.478
- I thought it was Malik's turn.
- We're out of 8.Os.

07:38.644 --> 07:42.399
- Malcolm, who's sorry now, you bastard?
- What did you do? Take a vacation?

07:42.566 --> 07:44.693
Not my fault Sam
didn't stock the shelves.

07:44.860 --> 07:47.446
- Tube.
- I can barely palpate a femoral.

07:47.613 --> 07:49.156
Heart rate's up to 140.

07:49.323 --> 07:51.826
Okay. Hang the O-neg
and call for type-specific.

07:51.993 --> 07:55.371
- Ray, he needs an IJ.
- And a surgeon. O.R. 3's on hold.

07:55.538 --> 07:58.625
You got this?
I need to check next door.

07:58.792 --> 08:00.543
- How's she doing?
- Her lungs are down.

08:00.710 --> 08:03.547
She's stable but she's agitated.
Sam, where's that Versed?

08:03.714 --> 08:05.466
- What are they doing?
- Here you go.

08:05.633 --> 08:07.885
- I was getting it.
- Okay. I was just right here.

08:08.052 --> 08:09.595
- I've got it covered, Luka.
- Okay.

08:09.762 --> 08:13.350
They better not send him home. I'm
changing the locks, not gonna let him in.

08:13.517 --> 08:16.394
Mary, you need to calm down
and answer some questions for me.

08:16.561 --> 08:18.146
- Where are you?
- Some hospital.

08:18.313 --> 08:20.732
- And what year is it?
-2005.

08:20.899 --> 08:23.235
- Good. And where do you live?
- West Garfield.

08:24.403 --> 08:26.072
West Garfield?

08:26.239 --> 08:27.698
Do you got a problem with that?

08:28.157 --> 08:31.369
Bilateral crackles, 3/6,
harsh systolic murmur JVD...

08:31.536 --> 08:33.913
...and the liver's down four centimeters.

08:34.080 --> 08:36.041
You heard him.
He doesn't wanna see me.

08:36.207 --> 08:38.669
- Why don't you present to Kovac?
- Tied up in a trauma.

08:38.836 --> 08:41.630
We're waiting on call from his doc.
I got him to calm down...

08:41.797 --> 08:44.383
...by promising to bring in
an experienced physician.

08:44.550 --> 08:48.054
- Which means an Attending. Means you.
- All right. Any cardiac history there?

08:48.221 --> 08:51.891
Chronic CHF and evidence
of an old infarct.

08:57.815 --> 09:00.359
I sent off troponins.
I'll get an EKG when you're done.

09:00.526 --> 09:02.778
And did Obermeyer call yet?

09:03.946 --> 09:05.781
Hello.

09:05.948 --> 09:07.241
I'm Dr. Carter.

09:07.408 --> 09:10.579
Don't worry. I remember your name.

09:10.996 --> 09:12.956
Ten years, I don't forget.

09:13.748 --> 09:15.917
- I understand-
- You remember my name?

09:16.084 --> 09:17.752
Rubadoux?

09:18.628 --> 09:21.882
- That's a very unusual name.
- You don't even remember.

09:22.049 --> 09:24.468
And you don't remember
my wife then either, do you?

09:25.136 --> 09:28.472
Just some other old person.
Give them the old song and dance...

09:28.639 --> 09:30.892
...and ship them off.

09:31.476 --> 09:34.313
Okay. We need to hear from your doctor.
So in the meantime-

09:34.479 --> 09:36.982
I knew she didn't have much time left.

09:37.149 --> 09:40.110
But why did you have
to put her through all that?

09:41.069 --> 09:45.325
My sweet Sylvie. Keeping a smile
every step of the way.

09:46.993 --> 09:49.120
- Let's take a quick listen.
- No, no, no.

09:49.287 --> 09:51.497
I want my own doctor.

09:52.373 --> 09:55.669
Mr. Rubadoux, he's the Attending.
He has to examine you.

09:55.836 --> 09:58.714
What do you mean, "has to"?
What is there, a law around here...

09:58.881 --> 10:00.758
...a rule when you come into this place?

10:00.924 --> 10:02.259
Yes. Actually, there is.

10:04.387 --> 10:07.640
All right. Make it fast.

10:17.735 --> 10:19.195
What was that about?

10:19.445 --> 10:21.447
A very unsatisfied customer.

10:21.822 --> 10:23.991
- He needs an echo.
- I called Kayson. He's on it.

10:24.158 --> 10:26.703
Radiology called about
that kid with the huge head.

10:26.870 --> 10:28.538
- Hydroceph-?
- Hydrocephalus, yeah.

10:28.705 --> 10:30.665
I'll call Neurosurg.

10:33.210 --> 10:37.255
- Even more of a handful than before.
- You remember him?

10:37.422 --> 10:40.176
Don't let him get to you, Carter.
It was a long time ago...

10:40.343 --> 10:42.470
...and you were just a student.

10:47.558 --> 10:49.937
Dr. Lewis, thought you were off.
What are you doing?

10:50.104 --> 10:51.438
- Don't ask.
- Been paging you.

10:51.605 --> 10:53.524
I was in a meeting.
I turned my pager off.

10:53.690 --> 10:55.651
Got a double trauma.
Long as you are here-

10:55.818 --> 10:59.655
- I'm not here.
- The meeting got changed to 3:30.

11:00.365 --> 11:02.158
- What?
- That's why I've been paging you.

11:02.325 --> 11:04.661
I just worked all night.
I can't stay till 3:30.

11:08.581 --> 11:10.041
"Rubba-ducks"?

11:10.208 --> 11:12.962
Rubadoux, Sylvie.
How long will this take?

11:13.129 --> 11:15.381
Ten-year-old chart? Could be a while.

11:17.007 --> 11:18.926
I'll wait.

11:29.563 --> 11:32.315
Certainly thinks highly of you.

11:32.482 --> 11:34.819
Well, that's very flattering
coming from him.

11:34.986 --> 11:38.114
Oh, and don't get me wrong.
He was brilliant. But he drove us crazy.

11:38.281 --> 11:40.533
Made us do a full workup
on every single sniffle.

11:41.200 --> 11:45.539
Well, that's my Dr. Obermeyer.

11:45.873 --> 11:47.958
Nothing if not thorough.

11:48.125 --> 11:51.962
- Dilated left ventricle, gradient's 86.
- Those calcifications?

11:52.129 --> 11:54.256
I'm listening to the doctor, please.

11:54.423 --> 11:57.176
Ejection fraction's only 45,
but seeing as he presented...

11:57.343 --> 12:01.347
...with both syncope and failure,
there's really only one option.

12:03.516 --> 12:05.727
Mr. Rubadoux,
you have critical aortic stenosis.

12:05.894 --> 12:08.147
One of the valves
in your heart is narrowed.

12:08.314 --> 12:11.984
- We have to operate to open that valve.
- Operate?

12:13.527 --> 12:15.154
- When?
- Well, as soon as possible.

12:15.321 --> 12:19.784
Your heart's not generating enough force
to push blood through that constriction.

12:19.951 --> 12:22.412
And you can do something about that?

12:22.579 --> 12:25.415
Well, we have to run a few tests.
But, yes, we can.

12:25.582 --> 12:29.503
I'll talk to Anspaugh. You check his BUN,
creatinine, order PFTs.

12:29.670 --> 12:32.465
- Hang in there, Mr. Rubadoux.
- Call me Ruby.

12:33.257 --> 12:34.884
Ruby.

12:38.554 --> 12:42.517
Hey, pretty lucky, huh?
Same school as my doc.

12:45.354 --> 12:46.605
Nothing personal...

12:46.772 --> 12:50.859
...but they both have a little bit
more water under the bridge...

12:51.026 --> 12:54.739
- ...if you know what I mean.
- I know what you mean.

12:55.156 --> 12:58.534
- Did you understand everything he said?
- Yeah.

12:58.701 --> 13:01.037
Yeah, I need a heart operation.

13:01.204 --> 13:03.040
Do you have any questions?

13:03.999 --> 13:06.835
- Heart surgery's a big deal.
- I know that.

13:07.002 --> 13:08.295
What, am I an idiot?

13:09.630 --> 13:12.383
Well, do you also know that,
given your age...

13:12.549 --> 13:14.719
...the risks of surgery are higher?

13:16.096 --> 13:18.807
- What risks?
- Complications.

13:19.391 --> 13:21.518
I mean, I need to get
some more information...

13:21.684 --> 13:23.645
...on your lung function
and your kidneys.

13:23.812 --> 13:27.316
- Something wrong with my kidneys?
- No. I don't know. I don't know yet.

13:27.483 --> 13:31.904
Yeah. Well, why don't you come back
when you're less confused.

13:34.490 --> 13:37.494
Okay. Mr. Rubadoux,
I just want you to understand...

13:37.661 --> 13:40.455
...that this surgery is very serious.

13:40.622 --> 13:43.333
And that we don't know yet
if you're even a good candidate.

13:43.792 --> 13:47.672
And that it's important
you consider all of your options.

13:49.674 --> 13:51.759
Listen, doll...

13:52.969 --> 13:54.929
...can you fix my heart?

13:56.222 --> 13:57.265
No.

13:57.432 --> 14:01.186
Then I'm going with the guy who can.
All right?

14:05.566 --> 14:07.442
Bye.

14:23.460 --> 14:27.214
Prior Ml, marginal ventricular function,
and his creatinine's 2.3.

14:27.381 --> 14:28.632
He's 85.

14:28.799 --> 14:30.843
He has significant
coronary-artery disease...

14:31.010 --> 14:33.221
...renal insufficiency
and a history of COPD.

14:33.388 --> 14:36.725
- What do you think about his lungs?
- We can check his PFTs, but he's old.

14:36.892 --> 14:39.561
- They're not gonna be perfect.
- Anything else you want?

14:39.728 --> 14:41.521
Send coags.
Have him typed and crossed.

14:41.688 --> 14:44.942
Excuse me. I'm sorry,
but don't you think, just maybe...

14:45.109 --> 14:48.070
...open-heart surgery might not be
such a good idea for this man?

14:48.237 --> 14:51.407
Don't you think just maybe
that's the surgeon's call?

14:52.408 --> 14:54.828
Actually, no.
I think it's the patient's call.

14:55.245 --> 14:57.915
He could spend the rest of his life
on a beach in Miami...

14:58.081 --> 15:00.918
- ...or hooked up to a ventilator.
- He wants the surgery.

15:01.084 --> 15:03.337
She's trying to advocate
on behalf of her patient.

15:03.503 --> 15:07.425
CICU's full and Mr. Rubadoux needs a
bed. She could advocate for him there.

15:07.592 --> 15:09.761
Anspaugh's on his way down.

15:14.474 --> 15:15.975
What?

15:18.562 --> 15:21.774
- So how's it going in there?
- I'll take a 12-year-old gangster...

15:21.941 --> 15:24.777
...over a domestic-violence case
any day.

15:25.194 --> 15:28.573
She said she was from West Garfield.
I figured I should give you a call.

15:28.740 --> 15:31.368
But I wasn't sure
if this was a Ceasefire kind of thing.

15:31.534 --> 15:33.244
Every shooting is a Ceasefire thing.

15:33.411 --> 15:36.456
If she gets out of this mess,
there's a lot we could do for her.

15:36.623 --> 15:38.793
I don't know. She seems
pretty far gone to me.

15:38.960 --> 15:41.087
- How do you stay so optimistic?
- How do you?

15:41.253 --> 15:45.174
What? Stay optimistic? I don't. Three
years in this place, I'm jaded as hell.

15:45.341 --> 15:48.719
You just saw a drunk, battered woman
who shot her abusive husband...

15:48.886 --> 15:51.556
- ...and saw some hope in the situation.
- I did?

15:51.723 --> 15:54.643
You wouldn't have called me
if you didn't think I could help.

15:55.727 --> 15:57.729
I see right through you, Dr. Pratt.

15:59.189 --> 16:00.983
Is that right?

16:02.819 --> 16:05.405
We'll follow up with her
after she's discharged.

16:05.571 --> 16:07.323
- So that's it? You're done?
- For now.

16:07.490 --> 16:10.243
Shouldn't you stick around?
She's bound to have questions...

16:10.410 --> 16:12.579
- ...once sedation wears off.
- You can handle it.

16:12.746 --> 16:15.541
But I don't know too much
about domestic-violence counseling.

16:15.874 --> 16:18.001
I would love to give you
a lengthy tutorial...

16:18.168 --> 16:20.921
- ...but I'm out of time.
- How about later?

16:21.088 --> 16:23.466
You can school me over dinner.

16:28.054 --> 16:30.432
Pick me up at the office at 7.

16:35.271 --> 16:38.774
- Is this gonna take long?
- We've already been here quite a while.

16:38.941 --> 16:40.693
We'll need to be going soon.

16:40.860 --> 16:43.863
You had a low-grade temperature
when the nurse took it earlier.

16:44.029 --> 16:45.866
Beautiful girl.

16:46.032 --> 16:49.077
- Caramel skin.
- Like a young June Allyson.

16:49.244 --> 16:51.204
- Maureen O'Sullivan.
- Susan Hayward.

16:51.371 --> 16:52.914
- Ava Gardner.
- Myrna Loy.

16:53.081 --> 16:56.586
- Sophia Loren.
- Sophia Loren?

16:59.422 --> 17:02.008
Okay. I heard some crackles
on the right side.

17:02.175 --> 17:03.968
Could be a sign of a lung infection.

17:04.135 --> 17:06.554
- You'll need to have a chest x-ray.
- Crackles?

17:06.721 --> 17:09.849
- The other doctor didn't mention crackles.
- No.

17:10.017 --> 17:12.603
That's right. You were in here
over a week ago.

17:12.769 --> 17:14.146
You saw Dr. Lockhart?

17:14.771 --> 17:16.064
Lovely woman.

17:16.231 --> 17:17.816
Like a young Patty Duke.

17:19.819 --> 17:24.406
Now, your aortic valve right here
is stiff and stuck shut.

17:24.574 --> 17:27.577
What we're going to do is
cut out all of the stenotic material...

17:27.743 --> 17:29.997
...and replace it with a porcine valve.

17:30.164 --> 17:31.957
So it's definite he's having surgery?

17:34.585 --> 17:36.128
It is.

17:36.462 --> 17:40.591
Isn't it? I mean, it's-
It's the only way to go, right?

17:40.758 --> 17:44.930
We could treat you with digoxin and
diuretics, but that would be short-term.

17:45.096 --> 17:48.058
At this stage, surgery's
the only definitive treatment.

17:48.225 --> 17:51.436
Just so you know, Dr. Anspaugh,
his FEV 1 is only 53 percent.

17:52.605 --> 17:54.565
- Thank you.
- Make him NPO after midnight.

17:54.732 --> 17:58.486
And don't his decreased lung capacity
and renal insufficiency strongly con-?

18:04.284 --> 18:07.162
What I mean is, shouldn't
we be discussing the risks?

18:07.329 --> 18:09.289
Yeah. But we talked about all that.

18:09.456 --> 18:12.668
The risk, the complications, the kidneys.

18:12.834 --> 18:15.338
We're going to talk
about them again, Mr. Rubadoux.

18:16.464 --> 18:17.757
Call me Ruby.

18:18.216 --> 18:20.677
- Will you excuse me for just a minute?
- Certainly.

18:20.843 --> 18:22.887
Dr. Lockhart.

18:29.061 --> 18:32.481
I take it you have a problem with
Mr. Rubadoux's decision to have surgery.

18:32.648 --> 18:34.858
I'm concerned it's not
an informed decision, yes.

18:35.025 --> 18:37.988
And is that because you failed
to adequately explain the risks?

18:39.322 --> 18:43.076
Do you think I would operate on this man
if he didn't understand the consequences?

18:43.410 --> 18:46.037
Why would I do that?
Because I have nothing better to do?

18:46.454 --> 18:48.416
- No, certainly.
- If you have concerns...

18:48.582 --> 18:51.460
...you ask the consulting doctor
to step outside.

18:51.627 --> 18:54.547
You do not, in front of a patient,
attempt to subtly disagree...

18:54.714 --> 18:57.466
...with the senior cardiologist
and the chief of surgery.

18:58.134 --> 19:01.763
That kind of behavior
is helpful to no one.

19:02.514 --> 19:05.225
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

19:08.520 --> 19:09.855
I have concerns.

19:22.035 --> 19:24.413
Knowing you as well as I do...

19:24.580 --> 19:27.249
...I'm gonna guess you really
hate it when people do this.

19:27.416 --> 19:30.210
The come-from-behind-
and-put-your-hands-over-the-eyes thing?

19:30.377 --> 19:33.757
Yeah. Words cannot express
exactly how much I hate it.

19:34.841 --> 19:36.926
Pretty cool that I knew that,
don't you think?

19:38.261 --> 19:39.512
- Bad timing?
- Yes.

19:39.679 --> 19:41.848
- Want to talk about it?
- No.

19:42.807 --> 19:44.894
So I'm back.

19:45.060 --> 19:47.730
Oh, my God, Jake.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

19:47.897 --> 19:49.607
- It's okay.
- How was San Francisco?

19:49.774 --> 19:51.901
Amazing faculty. Lots of O.R. time.

19:52.067 --> 19:54.236
I thought Boston was first
until I saw UCSF...

19:54.403 --> 19:57.240
- ...but it's a long shot.
- They wouldn't have invited you...

19:57.407 --> 19:59.493
...if they weren't interested.
Where's Carter?

19:59.659 --> 20:02.621
- MRI.
- Thanks. So UCSF, huh?

20:02.787 --> 20:06.667
Yes. I liked it. But, you know,
I still could match right here.

20:06.834 --> 20:09.253
- Yup.
- What would happen if I did that?

20:09.420 --> 20:12.423
Well, Jake, then you'd
be working at County.

20:12.840 --> 20:15.551
Dirk Harmon, 14. Crashed headfirst
into a retaining wall...

20:15.718 --> 20:17.763
- ...while luging down Sheridan Road.
- Luging?

20:17.930 --> 20:20.182
Street luge.
Don't you watch those guys on ESPN?

20:20.349 --> 20:24.269
- When do you watch ESPN?
- Pulse, 72. BP, 112/65. Sats 100.

20:24.436 --> 20:26.313
I'm Dr. Pratt. How fast were you going?

20:26.480 --> 20:28.775
- Forty, maybe 50.
- All right.

20:28.942 --> 20:31.945
- Come on, you guys.
- He's one of the qualifiers at Super Mass.

20:32.111 --> 20:33.655
But I'm really more into dual.

20:33.821 --> 20:35.823
- Where do you find hills in Chicago?
- Luka.

20:35.990 --> 20:38.076
- You do snow too?
- Totally.

20:38.243 --> 20:40.704
Hello, everyone.
He just rammed his head into a wall.

20:40.871 --> 20:42.623
- Yes.
- Yes.

20:44.083 --> 20:48.379
- Hey, dude. My hands are numb.
- Weird.

20:48.545 --> 20:50.507
- When did that start?
- Just noticed it.

20:50.674 --> 20:53.134
Pratt, hold the C-spine.
Let's move him carefully.

20:53.718 --> 20:56.930
Hey. I need to talk to you
about the Rubadoux thing.

20:57.097 --> 21:00.225
Birdy Chaddock, 72-year-old female
with cough and low-grade temp.

21:00.392 --> 21:03.896
Sats fine. No shortness of breath,
right middle lobe infiltrate on the film.

21:04.063 --> 21:07.191
She was your patient last week
so perhaps for continuity of care...

21:07.358 --> 21:09.860
- In with the same thing?
- No. Had facial contusions.

21:10.027 --> 21:12.864
- Her sister was with her?
- Oh, yeah. She's here this time too.

21:13.031 --> 21:16.243
She's got family support. Treat her
like an outpatient, send her home.

21:16.410 --> 21:19.329
- They're panhandlers. Both.
- Everybody's gotta make a living.

21:19.705 --> 21:20.956
What is wrong with you?

21:22.207 --> 21:25.336
- She won't get better on the streets.
- Call Social Services...

21:25.503 --> 21:30.049
- ...hook her up with elder assistance.
- They did express interest in leaving soon.

21:30.425 --> 21:32.802
Call Social Services.

21:33.469 --> 21:36.807
Okay, about Mr. Rubadoux.
Nobody is painting him a clear picture.

21:36.974 --> 21:38.350
Surgery is a lousy choice.

21:38.517 --> 21:40.769
- His choice.
- He does not have an objective view.

21:40.936 --> 21:44.523
Seventeen-year-old, avulsed finger.
Sign so we can treat without the parents.

21:44.690 --> 21:47.027
- How'd he do it?
- Slammed his hand in the car door.

21:47.235 --> 21:49.571
- Somebody needs to talk to him.
- You're his doctor.

21:49.738 --> 21:51.489
You're the Attending.
He's old school.

21:51.656 --> 21:53.366
He needs to hear it from a guy.

21:53.533 --> 21:56.494
It's that time. Girl Scout cookies.
I'm feeling the pressure.

21:56.661 --> 21:58.622
- Okay.
- We'll find you later, all right?

21:58.789 --> 22:00.207
- Just...
- Okay.

22:00.374 --> 22:02.752
What is going on with you?
Why keep blowing this off?

22:02.918 --> 22:05.087
- I'm not.
- You tried to stop our conversation...

22:05.254 --> 22:06.756
...to buy Girl Scout cookies.

22:07.548 --> 22:09.926
- Talk to this guy.
- I'm not the one to do it.

22:10.093 --> 22:14.723
Okay. I don't know exactly what went
on between you and him, but right now-

22:14.890 --> 22:17.517
Look. Once in a while
you're gonna find these old guys...

22:17.684 --> 22:20.938
...that would rather be treated by
a gray-haired guy with a white coat.

22:21.105 --> 22:25.276
- Figure out a way of getting to him.
- Been trying for an hour. He's a wall.

22:25.443 --> 22:26.986
Well, then you did your job.

22:27.153 --> 22:29.071
Move on.

22:34.203 --> 22:36.371
Dr. Lewis?

22:36.538 --> 22:39.249
- Dr. Lewis?
- Yes, Jerry.

22:39.416 --> 22:41.503
Are you sleeping?

22:42.712 --> 22:45.965
Probably not, huh?
The Chief Residency meeting is starting.

22:46.424 --> 22:49.052
Thank you, Jerry.

22:49.219 --> 22:51.888
Are you really up?
Because I have to leave now.

22:52.055 --> 22:54.934
Yes, Jerry.

23:09.950 --> 23:11.785
Eighteen hundred
Solu-Medrol going in.

23:11.952 --> 23:14.621
- What do you got?
- Keep your eyes closed, Dirk.

23:14.788 --> 23:17.959
Traumatic C-spine injury.
I didn't wanna just yank the helmet off.

23:18.125 --> 23:19.335
Pretty cool, huh?

23:19.502 --> 23:21.796
Dude, one move,
they'll slice through your head.

23:21.963 --> 23:23.839
Shut up, man. This is gnarly.

23:24.006 --> 23:26.802
Compared to the Gravity Games,
this is nothing, man.

23:26.969 --> 23:28.804
Except for a little cord compression.

23:30.639 --> 23:31.974
Anybody seen Carter?

23:32.140 --> 23:35.143
He's probably at the meeting
where Luka and I are supposed to be.

23:35.310 --> 23:38.439
Anspaugh wants a central line
on our aortic-stenosis patient.

23:38.606 --> 23:40.817
- Pratt, go help Abby. I'll finish that.
- Okay.

23:40.984 --> 23:43.820
Sterile 9s and prep for a cordis.

23:47.907 --> 23:50.202
- Nice suit, Morris.
- Thank you.

23:50.369 --> 23:54.164
It's important for the Chief Resident
to project a certain professionalism.

23:54.331 --> 23:58.502
And I must say, life in the ER doesn't
offer enough opportunity to dress up.

23:59.796 --> 24:02.340
- Sorry I'm late.
- You haven't missed anything.

24:02.507 --> 24:05.176
Dr. Lewis, if you don't mind.

24:06.761 --> 24:07.846
The lights, please.

24:13.561 --> 24:15.004
"CHIEF RESIDENT"

24:15.071 --> 24:19.191
The Chief Resident in a busy,
urban ER must wear many hats:

24:19.775 --> 24:23.165
Teacher, mentor, counselor, friend.

24:23.200 --> 24:24.656
SCHEDULING TASK MASTER

24:25.532 --> 24:27.534
- Over the course of the next hour...
- Hour?

24:27.701 --> 24:31.413
...I will review my proposed strategy
for making the Residents' schedule...

24:31.580 --> 24:36.002
...and address how the new ACGME/RRC
work-hour mandates apply.

24:36.169 --> 24:39.964
I will also identify common stumbling
blocks that may affect the schedule...

24:40.131 --> 24:45.262
...and present my patented win-win
approach to problems and changes.

24:45.429 --> 24:46.680
Next slide.

24:47.181 --> 24:48.349
You can't just leave.

24:48.515 --> 24:50.976
Oh, yes, at our age we can.

24:51.143 --> 24:55.273
I'm sorry Social Services is backed up but
we need them to see you before you go.

24:55.440 --> 24:58.276
We saw them the last time
we were here. Lovely woman.

24:58.443 --> 25:00.695
- Oh, a regular young-
- No, no. God, no, please.

25:00.862 --> 25:03.907
- Please, just-
- Dr. Barnett, we are grateful.

25:04.074 --> 25:06.076
And we're gonna do the best we can.

25:06.242 --> 25:08.913
But it's important that we leave now.

25:09.080 --> 25:11.874
We cannot miss the rush hour at the El.

25:12.041 --> 25:15.920
And if it gets you in any kind of trouble,
I'm so sorry.

25:16.087 --> 25:18.381
- We could write you a note.
- A note?

25:18.548 --> 25:19.925
It's not gonna be good enough.

25:20.092 --> 25:21.885
You see...

25:22.052 --> 25:25.263
...last week, two of my other patients,
they left on me.

25:25.430 --> 25:27.641
And my boss is really unhappy with me.

25:28.935 --> 25:31.604
He says if this happens again,
they're gonna send me to-

25:31.938 --> 25:34.774
- Away?
- Well, to...

25:34.941 --> 25:36.734
...the morgue.

25:37.485 --> 25:39.905
- The morgue?
- Yeah.

25:40.072 --> 25:41.698
It's a...

25:41.865 --> 25:43.408
...big demotion.

25:46.495 --> 25:47.913
- He's clever.
- Oh, yeah.

25:48.497 --> 25:50.290
You gotta give him that.

25:51.501 --> 25:54.546
Page me from MRl.
I wanna see the scan.

26:04.598 --> 26:08.310
- Sam, what's going on?
- Nothing. I'm cleaning up and restocking.

26:08.477 --> 26:11.146
- Is this about the luge boy?
- You were encouraging him.

26:11.313 --> 26:13.817
- I wasn't.
- Pratt and Ray, that I can understand.

26:13.984 --> 26:16.820
Sam, I wasn't.
And you're overreacting.

26:26.539 --> 26:27.790
A little bit?

26:30.459 --> 26:32.920
I'm just having a bad day.
I have a headache.

26:33.087 --> 26:35.382
Just- Hey, just tell them
you wanna leave early.

26:35.549 --> 26:36.842
- I'm fine.
- No, really.

26:37.009 --> 26:40.637
Tell them you wanna go home. If there
are any complaints, they can talk to me.

26:40.804 --> 26:42.723
Okay.

26:47.437 --> 26:50.815
- You're okay.
- I'm okay.

26:57.196 --> 26:59.700
Okay, aim your needle inferiorly.

26:59.867 --> 27:02.995
And watch the screen
as you enter the vein.

27:03.162 --> 27:04.872
How are we doing, Mr. Rubadoux?

27:05.039 --> 27:07.207
I don't know. You tell me.

27:08.042 --> 27:11.046
- Doing just great.
- Got a flash.

27:12.088 --> 27:13.340
Guidewire.

27:18.345 --> 27:22.350
- What is that? What's going on?
- It's okay, Mr. Rubadoux.

27:22.516 --> 27:23.893
- Throwing PVCs.
- Pull back.

27:27.730 --> 27:28.939
- Run of V-tach.
- Pull back.

27:29.106 --> 27:31.193
Yeah, I am.
I'm nowhere near the myocardium.

27:31.360 --> 27:32.736
I don't feel right.

27:33.236 --> 27:35.322
- V-tach again.
- All right, I'm coming out.

27:36.156 --> 27:38.033
- What's happening?
- Hang in there.

27:38.200 --> 27:40.911
- A hundred of lido.
- Mr. Rubadoux?

27:41.286 --> 27:45.249
Mr. Rubadoux? All right, let's get him into
a trauma room now. Come on, let's go.

27:45.416 --> 27:48.628
With the Morris-modified
circadian scheduling system...

27:48.795 --> 27:51.297
...we can build needed
flexibility into the program.

27:51.464 --> 27:53.842
A sample sequence might go like this:

27:54.176 --> 27:58.680
Three days, two off, three evenings,
two off, three nights, two off-

27:59.932 --> 28:02.393
- 911. It's the ER.
- Liar.

28:02.559 --> 28:05.480
- Morris, I apologize.
- I'll put a hard copy in your box.

28:05.647 --> 28:08.066
- That would be great.
- Get on with it, Dr. Morris.

28:08.733 --> 28:12.529
Three nights, two off,
and repeat until the end of the block.

28:12.695 --> 28:14.114
Next slide.

28:14.614 --> 28:16.492
Good news. Social Services is-

28:16.659 --> 28:18.035
- Hello.
- Hi.

28:18.202 --> 28:20.913
This is our niece, Shelley.

28:21.080 --> 28:24.625
I just found out they were here.
Thank you for taking care of them.

28:24.792 --> 28:28.338
- We wanted to leave, didn't we, doctor?
- Yes, we did try, right?

28:28.505 --> 28:31.007
- You made- You made us stay.
- Yes, I did.

28:31.174 --> 28:33.343
So now Shelley's here,
we can go with her.

28:33.510 --> 28:36.096
- No, no, no. You have to wait-
- Could we talk?

28:38.432 --> 28:40.643
Oh, yes. Go ahead. That's fine.

28:41.144 --> 28:43.146
Okay.

28:47.316 --> 28:50.696
Listen, we're waiting on Social Services
to come down here.

28:50.863 --> 28:53.824
Yes. And they're wonderful.
They've been so helpful.

28:53.991 --> 28:56.660
But, you know, it's been a long day
and they're both...

28:56.827 --> 28:59.830
- They're really getting tired.
- It shouldn't be too much longer.

29:03.334 --> 29:06.171
They're both so stubborn...

29:07.005 --> 29:08.756
...those two. I-

29:08.923 --> 29:12.178
I've been trying to get them
to move in with me.

29:12.344 --> 29:15.347
You know, they just-
They want their independence.

29:15.514 --> 29:18.183
So they can panhandle.
Isn't that unbelievable?

29:18.350 --> 29:19.602
Yeah.

29:19.768 --> 29:22.647
I told them that I could
get them right home, into a hot bath.

29:22.814 --> 29:24.900
Our oldest moved in with her boyfriend.

29:25.066 --> 29:26.735
We've got the extra bedroom now.

29:27.527 --> 29:30.488
I just- I've tried everything.
I don't know what else to do.

29:30.655 --> 29:33.450
I don't know how to make them
accept some family support.

29:33.618 --> 29:35.786
Okay, let me talk to them, all right?

29:36.621 --> 29:38.289
Okay.

29:38.748 --> 29:40.291
Birdy? Rebecca?

29:41.626 --> 29:44.922
- Still V-tach.
- All right, another epi. Chase it with lido.

29:45.088 --> 29:47.716
All right, switch out.
Set up to intubate.

29:48.926 --> 29:50.802
- What happened?
- A central line.

29:50.969 --> 29:53.388
It was fine until he started having
runs of V-tach.

29:53.555 --> 29:57.393
- Must have an irritable myocardium.
- Three-sixty. Clear.

29:59.062 --> 30:00.855
No change.

30:01.022 --> 30:03.399
- Why is Anspaugh opening this guy up?
- Critical AS.

30:03.900 --> 30:05.234
- Epi's in.
- Move that.

30:05.401 --> 30:08.614
Man can't tolerate a central line,
he isn't gonna do well in the O.R.

30:08.781 --> 30:10.240
- He wants the surgery.
- So what?

30:10.407 --> 30:13.994
- So we're giving it to him.
- Those guys got nothing better to do?

30:14.453 --> 30:15.913
Damn it.
I think I broke his rib.

30:18.750 --> 30:20.752
All right, clear.

30:24.172 --> 30:27.092
- Normal sinus.
- That's what I'm talking about.

30:55.623 --> 30:58.292
The Chief Resident position
is 90 percent administrative.

30:58.459 --> 30:59.710
Morris can handle that.

30:59.877 --> 31:02.130
Yeah. But even the med students
think he's a joke.

31:02.296 --> 31:05.968
- We should get someone from the outside.
- It's very difficult on the staff.

31:06.135 --> 31:08.303
You came from the outside.

31:08.804 --> 31:12.182
- How did the Morris meeting go?
- You missed a fascinating lecture...

31:12.349 --> 31:14.269
...on circadian scheduling.

31:14.436 --> 31:17.147
- We're not giving it to him though, right?
- Considering it.

31:17.313 --> 31:19.399
- You out of your mind?
- If you don't show up-

31:19.566 --> 31:22.152
I was in a trauma.
What did Carter say? We should vote.

31:22.318 --> 31:25.656
- You can't. You weren't there.
- I don't care. On 36 hours. I have to go.

31:25.823 --> 31:27.783
- And I'm late.
- John.

31:27.950 --> 31:30.411
- What happened on the meeting?
- I don't know. I left.

31:30.578 --> 31:34.623
- Kerry's leaning towards him.
- Yeah. Well, okay.

31:34.790 --> 31:36.209
"Well, okay"?

31:36.376 --> 31:37.669
We've had worse.

31:37.836 --> 31:40.297
- Don't think so.
- Then maybe she won't give it to him.

31:40.464 --> 31:43.925
Hey, Frank, can you come and find me
when the labs are back on Gase in 2?

31:44.092 --> 31:49.432
Yeah. Got it. You were gonna take
that haggard mom, five kids, Exam 3.

31:53.436 --> 31:57.982
Rubadoux's back, complaining about
his tube and telling the nurses no Jell-O.

31:58.149 --> 31:59.526
Good.

31:59.693 --> 32:04.072
I told Kayson and Anspaugh about the
ribs and the resultant pneumothorax.

32:04.239 --> 32:06.533
- What about the surgery?
- Not right away.

32:06.700 --> 32:10.872
They're going to stabilize him in CICU
for a few days, let the pneumo resolve.

32:11.039 --> 32:12.874
But everyone remains hopeful.

32:13.041 --> 32:15.168
We're just waiting on a bed.

32:19.797 --> 32:21.842
DON'T SHOOT.
I WANT TO GROW UP.

32:27.723 --> 32:30.601
- Can I help you?
- How you doing? Looking for Olivia Evans.

32:30.768 --> 32:32.896
- I'm supposed to meet her.
- She's in the back.

32:33.730 --> 32:36.191
- Follow me.
- Okay.

32:41.112 --> 32:45.910
Three grandmothers reclaimed 78th
and Hermitage by opening a bakery.

32:46.077 --> 32:49.413
Turned one of the roughest corners
in our city into a coffee klatch.

32:52.500 --> 32:55.170
Dr. Pratt, just in time.
Everyone, this is Greg Pratt.

32:55.337 --> 32:57.130
He's an ER doc at County.

32:57.297 --> 32:59.633
- Hello.
- How y'all doing?

32:59.800 --> 33:02.386
Dr. Pratt gets to see
how senseless shootings...

33:02.552 --> 33:04.471
...are overwhelming our city's hospitals.

33:04.638 --> 33:09.227
And we were just talking about various
job opportunities in the neighborhood.

33:09.394 --> 33:13.815
So maybe you'd like to say something
about jobs in health care?

33:25.369 --> 33:28.373
- Felix, get back here.
- This is for Tasha's ear infection.

33:28.540 --> 33:31.084
- Twice a day for a week.
- Holly's the one with the ear.

33:31.251 --> 33:33.128
Right. Tasha has the eczema.

33:33.294 --> 33:36.506
Apply to the affected area
three times a day for a week.

33:36.673 --> 33:38.801
- Just like the ears.
- No.

33:38.968 --> 33:41.470
Ears twice a day. Rash, three.

33:41.637 --> 33:43.764
Found him. He was running off
with your hammer.

33:43.931 --> 33:45.850
Thanks, Chuny.

33:46.308 --> 33:48.185
Just a minute.

33:51.189 --> 33:54.067
- I'm gonna go. Good night.
- I could use a little help here.

33:54.526 --> 33:59.030
One, two, three, four, five. I'm off.

33:59.698 --> 34:01.868
I'll be home by 8.
You wanna grab a dinner?

34:02.034 --> 34:03.995
I'm kind of beat.
Maybe stay in tonight.

34:04.370 --> 34:06.998
Okay. See you later.

34:14.130 --> 34:15.841
Good night.

34:24.476 --> 34:26.018
- Coffee?
- Yeah.

34:26.186 --> 34:27.437
Sorry to hear it.

34:28.521 --> 34:30.690
- Really awful this time of night.
- Oh, I know.

34:37.031 --> 34:38.491
"EMERGENCY"

34:42.828 --> 34:47.542
When I was a student on my surgical
rotation, Rubadoux's wife was very sick.

34:49.127 --> 34:51.463
She was part of this research study.

34:52.880 --> 34:55.509
When her results-

34:56.009 --> 34:58.679
When she wasn't useful,
there was pressure to get her out.

34:58.846 --> 35:01.015
So I did. I dumped her
into a nursing home.

35:02.350 --> 35:03.601
Did she belong in one?

35:05.770 --> 35:09.024
We all figured
she'd end up back in the hospital.

35:09.399 --> 35:11.902
But she'd be on the Medical Service
and not ours.

35:12.569 --> 35:13.820
So...

35:14.404 --> 35:16.490
...Surgery dumps
another patient on Medicine.

35:17.532 --> 35:18.742
Happens every day.

35:22.247 --> 35:25.250
I told Rubadoux
that she was gonna get better.

35:29.420 --> 35:32.591
I told him that her situation
was gonna improve.

35:32.758 --> 35:34.635
I told him what he wanted to hear.

35:37.596 --> 35:39.807
You know, when you're a student...

35:40.933 --> 35:42.978
...you're so desperate for approval.

35:43.144 --> 35:45.814
You want patients to like you,
their families to like you.

35:46.898 --> 35:51.319
You gotta be efficient too, though.
You gotta impress your superiors.

35:52.697 --> 35:55.950
You don't have to tell me. I'm still
on the bottom rung of the ladder.

35:56.117 --> 35:58.828
When the Chief of Surgery says,
"Get rid of her," you do.

35:58.995 --> 36:00.830
Yeah.

36:04.584 --> 36:07.004
And then she came back
about three days later...

36:07.170 --> 36:09.339
...and she died...

36:11.174 --> 36:13.176
...and Rubadoux was so surprised.

36:19.726 --> 36:22.103
Ultimately, it was the Attending's call.

36:22.270 --> 36:24.814
Wasn't my responsibility.

36:26.442 --> 36:28.610
You wanna help with this?

36:33.824 --> 36:36.535
- All right.
- Take it easy, man. You too, man. Right.

36:36.702 --> 36:38.955
One of my guys
has a real thing for science.

36:39.122 --> 36:41.541
I could bring him to County,
have you show him around.

36:41.708 --> 36:42.751
Sure.

36:42.917 --> 36:44.544
Never been out of the neighborhood.

36:44.711 --> 36:46.588
- Don't realize there's a city.
- I know.

36:46.755 --> 36:48.507
I was 10 before I saw Lake Michigan.

36:48.674 --> 36:50.468
You from Chicago?

36:50.634 --> 36:52.094
Any relation to Charlie Pratt?

36:52.845 --> 36:55.681
Charlie Pratt who works
for Parks and Recs over on Lamont?

36:55.848 --> 36:58.434
- Yeah. The older fellow.
- I don't know him.

36:58.601 --> 37:00.812
Hey, that was
a really nice meeting tonight.

37:01.021 --> 37:02.898
- I gotta run.
- Okay.

37:03.064 --> 37:04.691
- It's nice meeting you.
- You too.

37:05.692 --> 37:07.527
You're still speaking to me.

37:07.694 --> 37:09.529
- Yeah, I think so.
- I'm not sorry.

37:09.696 --> 37:12.408
I want you to see what we do.
You'd never come on your own.

37:12.575 --> 37:15.369
And I'm not apologizing
about the tuna casserole.

37:15.536 --> 37:19.791
But since you're being such a good
sport, I'm willing to buy dessert.

37:19.957 --> 37:23.378
So ice cream or key-lime pie?

37:23.754 --> 37:26.340
- I'm sorry. What?
- Dessert?

37:27.883 --> 37:29.426
Past your bedtime?

37:29.593 --> 37:34.390
No, no. It's just that I have this patient
I have to check back on in the ER.

37:34.557 --> 37:38.394
Well, then, I guess-
I guess you'd better be going.

37:39.145 --> 37:41.064
I'll call you.

37:54.078 --> 37:55.121
"PREGNANCY TEST"

37:55.288 --> 37:56.540
Fifteen ninety-five.

38:14.892 --> 38:17.187
Where you going, Ray?

38:17.896 --> 38:21.525
Look, I know I'm on for another half-hour,
but I have taken care of everything.

38:21.692 --> 38:24.236
Filled in Abby on all my cases.

38:24.861 --> 38:27.364
Is Abby your Attending?

38:28.408 --> 38:29.784
Right.

38:29.951 --> 38:32.161
Ulnar fracture
up getting casted in Ortho.

38:32.328 --> 38:34.580
Malignant otitis admitted to ENT.

38:34.747 --> 38:37.667
Tongue lac wants a vasectomy,
you know, as long as he's here.

38:37.834 --> 38:39.545
Gonna follow that up with Urology.

38:39.712 --> 38:43.299
Oh, and the Olsen twins. They decided
to leave with their niece and a Z-PAK.

38:43.465 --> 38:45.718
Follow-up in a week.

38:45.884 --> 38:47.511
What did Social Services say?

38:48.971 --> 38:52.058
They actually didn't make it down.
I mean, in time.

38:53.643 --> 38:54.978
But you released them anyway?

38:55.895 --> 38:58.231
I felt they had a strong
family support system.

38:58.398 --> 39:00.400
These are the panhandlers, right?

39:01.484 --> 39:04.113
You felt comfortable releasing them
to a family member...

39:04.280 --> 39:06.407
...who obviously hasn't been
much help so far.

39:06.574 --> 39:09.994
Their niece, yes. She admitted it's been
hard getting them to accept help.

39:10.161 --> 39:13.540
- They are moving in with her now.
- Is Social Services going to follow up?

39:13.707 --> 39:17.461
I mean, seeing as how you prevented
them from doing their job today.

39:19.880 --> 39:21.798
I will make those arrangements.

39:21.965 --> 39:23.508
I need to know everything.

39:23.675 --> 39:25.720
I need to know the status of every one:

39:25.887 --> 39:29.724
How they are, where they are, where
they're going, why they're going...

39:29.891 --> 39:31.601
You're still an intern, Ray.

39:31.768 --> 39:33.227
I'm the Attending.

39:33.394 --> 39:35.522
I'm responsible.

39:42.321 --> 39:43.864
I'm sorry.

39:46.701 --> 39:49.579
- Hernia guy's HMO is refusing to cover.
- He's not stable.

39:49.746 --> 39:51.790
- I'm not discharging.
- You wanna tell them?

39:51.956 --> 39:53.750
- I'll call.
- Sedation for Mr. Garrity.

39:53.917 --> 39:56.795
- Kovac was there. He can sign them.
- Okay.

39:56.961 --> 39:59.048
Won't believe this.
Your tibial fracture's...

39:59.215 --> 40:02.051
- ...requesting an organic cast.
- I'll be right there.

40:09.351 --> 40:10.727
Mr. Rubadoux?

40:13.230 --> 40:15.232
I'm not feeling well.

40:15.398 --> 40:16.775
So if you don't mind.

40:20.863 --> 40:22.782
I just wanted to...

40:22.949 --> 40:24.826
...say that I'm sorry.

40:26.953 --> 40:29.121
I couldn't believe it when I saw you.

40:30.331 --> 40:32.626
You're still here.

40:33.752 --> 40:36.296
Been 10 years since my...

40:36.463 --> 40:40.092
My Silvie's gone
and you're still here.

40:41.385 --> 40:42.595
Yeah.

40:44.097 --> 40:45.932
And you didn't even remember.

40:47.767 --> 40:49.018
Oh, well.

40:51.479 --> 40:54.733
They gave me six other doctors...

40:55.442 --> 40:57.111
...so I won't need you this time.

41:03.450 --> 41:06.246
I made a mistake with your wife.

41:07.789 --> 41:09.624
And I made a mistake with you.

41:09.791 --> 41:11.459
You don't think I know that?

41:13.628 --> 41:17.300
You don't think I regret
ever bringing my poor Silvie...

41:17.466 --> 41:20.219
...down to this damn place?

41:20.636 --> 41:22.513
You and your fancy tests.

41:22.680 --> 41:26.977
"We'll put her through this.
We'll put her through that."

41:27.144 --> 41:32.858
"Oh, Sylvie? Oh, she'll practically
be back on-stage dancing again."

41:33.025 --> 41:35.652
- Well, we did try.
- You tried?

41:35.819 --> 41:37.572
You tried?

41:38.615 --> 41:42.118
It became a very complicated situation.

41:44.329 --> 41:47.248
And I didn't have the experience
to handle it properly.

41:47.415 --> 41:50.878
All you had to be was a human being.

41:52.254 --> 41:54.465
You lied to me.

41:54.631 --> 41:56.592
And I believed you.

42:03.266 --> 42:06.019
My Silvie. My Silvie.

42:06.186 --> 42:09.397
She was really something.

42:21.243 --> 42:23.413
Mr. Rubadoux...

42:24.748 --> 42:27.167
...what you have wrong with you,
aortic stenosis...

42:27.334 --> 42:29.711
...can oftentimes
be corrected with surgery.

42:29.878 --> 42:33.674
But that doesn't mean that that's
the right thing for you to do.

42:35.176 --> 42:36.928
You're 85 years old.

42:37.095 --> 42:39.847
You have chronic respiratory problems.

42:40.014 --> 42:42.100
The chances of you
coming through surgery...

42:42.266 --> 42:45.145
...and getting back to the shape
that you're in right now:

42:45.312 --> 42:46.772
Pretty slim.

42:47.689 --> 42:49.983
If you go ahead with it,
there is a good chance...

42:50.150 --> 42:52.861
...that you will never leave
this hospital again.

42:53.028 --> 42:55.322
You'll be connected to a ventilator...

42:55.490 --> 42:59.577
...and you will live out the remainder
of your life in the Intensive Care Unit.

43:01.913 --> 43:05.834
Now, without the surgery, it's true,
you're not gonna get any better.

43:07.419 --> 43:13.008
But I believe that you will leave
this hospital under your own power.

43:13.175 --> 43:16.637
And you will have more time
with the people that you love.

43:18.140 --> 43:20.600
You will have more time...

43:21.768 --> 43:24.604
...being the person that you are today.

43:34.240 --> 43:36.242
And, yes...

43:36.450 --> 43:39.495
...10 years ago
I lied to you about your wife.

43:45.544 --> 43:48.630
But I am not lying to you right now.
