WEBVTT

00:02.240 --> 00:03.790
<i>Look, I have seen
more than I care to.</i>

00:03.960 --> 00:05.280
<i>I've done more than I care to.</i>

00:05.520 --> 00:07.030
<i>Have you found those
missing Sagitari yet?</i>

00:07.240 --> 00:08.950
Everyone in that
explosion was killed

00:09.120 --> 00:12.750
but I'm still picking up lots
of warm bodies behind there.

00:12.920 --> 00:15.830
<i>General Zod,
you have betrayed your people.</i>

00:16.000 --> 00:17.220
<i>You must be punished.</i>

00:21.440 --> 00:23.030
No!

00:23.200 --> 00:26.710
If this is your rebellion,
I want no further part in it.

00:27.960 --> 00:29.510
Zod has given us an ultimatum.

00:29.680 --> 00:32.910
He demands we hand you over
or everyone on the moon dies.

00:33.080 --> 00:35.070
<i>You can't be a part
of this rebellion.</i>

00:35.240 --> 00:37.030
<i>I've tried so hard
to keep you from making</i>

00:37.200 --> 00:38.030
<i>the tough choices.</i>

00:38.200 --> 00:39.990
<i>I never wanted you to have
blood on your hands.</i>

00:40.160 --> 00:42.720
<i>We don't have the numbers
to defend our base</i>

00:42.880 --> 00:44.630
<i>and hold the base station.</i>

00:47.520 --> 00:49.430
<i>Brainiac is alive in me.</i>

00:49.600 --> 00:50.870
<i>And gaining control.</i>

00:51.040 --> 00:55.510
Take me to my ship and I will
imbue you with the power

00:55.680 --> 00:58.190
to defeat General Zod.

00:58.920 --> 01:01.830
<i>I promise you I will
never let anything happen</i>

01:02.040 --> 01:03.360
<i>to you or Cor.</i>

01:04.120 --> 01:06.030
<i>Like the Els and
the Zods of the past,</i>

01:06.200 --> 01:08.070
<i>when the houses of our family
work together,</i>

01:08.240 --> 01:10.550
<i>we create greatness
that sustains Krypton.</i>

01:11.600 --> 01:13.230
<i>Scouts in the outlands
have pinpointed</i>

01:13.400 --> 01:14.750
<i>Doomsday's location--
an icescape system</i>

01:14.920 --> 01:15.710
<i>south of Kandor.</i>

01:16.080 --> 01:17.750
I need a progress report
on this weapon.

01:17.920 --> 01:19.350
<i>The hardware
components are complete.</i>

01:19.520 --> 01:21.430
<i>Projectile with
Stellarium-powered</i>

01:21.640 --> 01:24.510
<i>delivery system allowing for
unprecedented impact depth.</i>

01:24.680 --> 01:27.140
<i>Then I will test it
in the field.</i>

01:30.160 --> 01:34.470
<i>My fellow Kryptonians,
I know the last broadcast</i>

01:34.640 --> 01:39.270
<i>you watched was as painful
for you as it was for me.</i>

01:39.440 --> 01:44.430
<i>Those terrorists on Wegthor
executed my mother</i>

01:44.600 --> 01:48.380
<i>that we should all be afraid.</i>

01:48.560 --> 01:51.200
<i>But when I looked out on
the proud citizens of Kandor,</i>

01:51.360 --> 01:54.430
<i>I saw that message
was rejected.</i>

01:55.400 --> 01:57.630
<i>For I did not see fear.</i>

01:58.400 --> 02:01.040
<i>I saw courage.</i>

02:04.280 --> 02:08.110
<i>For what is courage,
if not the strength to stare</i>

02:08.280 --> 02:10.990
<i>defiantly into the face
of those who would have us</i>

02:11.160 --> 02:13.910
<i>live in fear,
and not turn away?</i>

02:15.440 --> 02:18.590
<i>True courage is the strength
to acknowledge the presence</i>

02:18.760 --> 02:20.950
<i>of that fear...</i>

02:23.600 --> 02:25.390
<i>And to overcome it.</i>

02:31.320 --> 02:34.590
<i>And because of the strength
you all gave me,</i>

02:35.440 --> 02:39.110
<i>all Kryptonians
can sleep easier tonight.</i>

02:42.800 --> 02:45.950
<i>Yes, the mythical beast
of the outlands has been</i>

02:46.120 --> 02:47.340
<i>brought to heel.</i>

02:47.560 --> 02:50.710
<i>And soon so will the rebels
on Wegthor,</i>

02:50.880 --> 02:54.390
<i>for they are about to face
a test of their courage,</i>

02:54.560 --> 02:58.750
<i>because the first fleet
of our space-faring ships</i>

02:58.920 --> 02:59.950
<i>is complete.</i>

03:02.760 --> 03:06.790
<i>It is time for Krypton to take
its rightful place</i>

03:06.960 --> 03:10.070
<i>in the universe,
not as the conquered,</i>

03:10.720 --> 03:12.110
<i>but as conquerors.</i>

03:27.800 --> 03:32.790
Seg, I know how much
you loved Lyta.

03:32.960 --> 03:35.520
And I'm sorry for what you
must be feeling right now.

03:37.400 --> 03:39.150
But when you're ready to talk,
I'm here to listen.

03:44.920 --> 03:47.510
Wait, where are we going?

03:47.960 --> 03:50.750
An excellent question.

03:52.560 --> 03:54.630
I can't get into
that right now.

03:55.360 --> 03:56.870
Please, just trust me.

03:58.320 --> 03:59.540
It's Brainiac, isn't it?

04:00.640 --> 04:01.830
You can't tell me where
we're going

04:02.000 --> 04:03.320
because he can hear everything.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.230
Not just what you say,
Seg-El

04:07.400 --> 04:09.990
but what you're thinking, too.

04:12.040 --> 04:14.470
It's too late.
He knows.

04:15.040 --> 04:17.600
Nyssa, I need you
to listen to me.

04:17.760 --> 04:19.589
The only way to make sure that
everyone's gonna be safe

04:19.760 --> 04:21.190
is to get Brainiac out
of me for good.

04:21.399 --> 04:23.430
But we cannot go anywhere
near his Skull Ship.

04:23.600 --> 04:25.870
If Brainiac reconnects with
his quantum consciousness,

04:26.040 --> 04:27.510
he'll be too powerful
for anyone to stop.

04:27.680 --> 04:29.870
- We--
- That's enough.

04:30.080 --> 04:30.870
Seg!

04:32.120 --> 04:32.990
Seg?

04:35.680 --> 04:38.510
Fortress.

04:38.680 --> 04:39.710
Fortress?

04:40.120 --> 04:41.150
Hold on.

04:41.560 --> 04:42.550
I'll get us there.

04:56.320 --> 04:58.910
Hey.
Have we heard from Seg yet?

04:59.640 --> 05:01.310
No.

05:01.720 --> 05:03.670
So we still don't know
if he knows about Lyta?

05:04.000 --> 05:05.550
Well, we have
to assume he does.

05:05.720 --> 05:07.510
It was broadcast
all over Krypton.

05:07.680 --> 05:09.750
I've been trying to reach him,
but there's been

05:09.920 --> 05:11.950
no communication
with Krypton since...

05:12.480 --> 05:14.710
since we destroyed
the elevator base station.

05:15.240 --> 05:18.190
But right now we've got
more immediate concerns.

05:20.640 --> 05:22.630
Hey, Kem.

05:23.040 --> 05:25.190
Tagging along on
another mission, huh, buddy?

05:28.040 --> 05:29.030
I'm leading the mission.

05:31.040 --> 05:34.030
You asked Kem to lead?
Why didn't you ask me?

05:34.200 --> 05:35.870
Have you been fighting
alongside the Sagitari

05:36.040 --> 05:37.510
- for the last six months?
- Oh, no, but--

05:37.680 --> 05:40.240
And do you possess a thorough
and intimate knowledge

05:40.440 --> 05:42.550
of the various tunnel
systems on Wegthor?

05:44.080 --> 05:45.590
- No, but--
- No.

05:46.280 --> 05:48.590
Listen, the only way
to gain experience is...

05:50.760 --> 05:52.190
through experience.

05:54.520 --> 05:56.150
Can I just join?

05:57.000 --> 05:59.590
Ask Kem.
His mission.

06:00.760 --> 06:01.900
His team.

06:03.240 --> 06:03.950
Wha--

06:14.800 --> 06:15.830
Hey.

06:18.800 --> 06:20.470
You really--you're gonna
make me say this out loud,

06:20.640 --> 06:21.390
aren't you?

06:22.640 --> 06:23.630
Oh, yeah.

06:25.720 --> 06:27.430
- Can I please--
- Sorry?

06:27.960 --> 06:28.830
Can I please join
the mission?

06:29.000 --> 06:30.350
Of course you can join.

06:31.240 --> 06:32.630
- Well, thank you.
- No, thank you.

06:32.800 --> 06:34.830
You don't know how difficult
it's been trying to recruit

06:35.000 --> 06:36.550
- a squad for this.
- Oh, why?

06:36.720 --> 06:37.860
What's the mission?

06:38.200 --> 06:40.430
To locate and neutralize
those Sagitari

06:40.600 --> 06:42.270
that Zod sent down the mine.

06:42.440 --> 06:44.030
- That's not so bad.
- No.

06:44.160 --> 06:45.590
Assuming they're where
we last saw them.

06:45.800 --> 06:46.870
They're not.

06:47.040 --> 06:48.550
Really?
You think they moved?

06:49.160 --> 06:50.670
You think they're
planning an attack.

06:50.840 --> 06:52.390
Well, I have no idea, Adam.

06:52.560 --> 06:55.230
That's why we need to find them
before they find us.

06:55.840 --> 06:57.430
Don't worry.
It'll be fun.

06:58.920 --> 06:59.830
Right.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.510
If you like cold,
cramped, dark spaces

07:02.680 --> 07:05.990
and the very real possibility
that we will be exposed

07:06.160 --> 07:07.830
to raw Stellarium deposits,
resulting

07:08.000 --> 07:11.430
in severe radiation poisoning.

07:11.880 --> 07:15.110
What's that--that like,
the radiation poisoning?

07:15.280 --> 07:16.870
Oh, well, I mean, it affects
everyone differently.

07:17.080 --> 07:17.830
- Mmm.
- You know?

07:18.040 --> 07:19.910
This one guy, that I--
that I saw,

07:21.200 --> 07:24.430
diarrhea so bad that he shat
out his entire skeleton.

07:24.600 --> 07:26.270
Can you believe that?

07:26.840 --> 07:28.230
And he survived.

07:28.560 --> 07:30.790
You know, sometimes at night,
when I close my eyes,

07:30.960 --> 07:32.910
I can still smell it.

07:34.440 --> 07:38.750
And the noises he made.

07:39.760 --> 07:42.990
Anyway, gear up, Earthling.
We leave in 20, yeah?

07:52.200 --> 07:53.310
It's clear.

07:53.480 --> 07:55.030
I guess Zod took whatever
he needed from here

07:55.240 --> 07:56.190
before abandoning it.

07:56.640 --> 07:59.710
- Up there.
- You don't look so good.

07:59.880 --> 08:01.750
- You should rest.
- We don't have time.

08:02.760 --> 08:04.910
Seg.
What a surprise.

08:05.280 --> 08:06.270
How can I be of service?

08:06.720 --> 08:07.630
Brainiac.

08:07.840 --> 08:09.550
He's inside of my body
and he's shutting me down.

08:09.720 --> 08:10.590
We need your help, Val.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.910
- Come with me.
- Wait!

08:13.080 --> 08:13.950
Wait.

08:15.360 --> 08:17.710
I just wanna hold him
one last time.

08:17.880 --> 08:19.230
Just in ca--

08:19.880 --> 08:21.310
Just--

08:21.520 --> 08:23.030
Seg!

08:23.200 --> 08:24.950
I can't hold him off
any longer.

08:25.120 --> 08:27.030
Seg?

08:28.360 --> 08:29.350
Seg!

08:35.799 --> 08:38.789
The hypersonic brainwave
pulse remains stable.

08:41.200 --> 08:43.470
But turning him off
is not enough.

08:43.640 --> 08:47.110
- To weaponize him, I need--
- Complete control.

08:47.560 --> 08:48.550
Yes.

08:49.360 --> 08:51.470
To unlock the safe
of Doomsday's mind

08:51.640 --> 08:54.830
via Somatic Reconditioning,
we first need to navigate

08:55.000 --> 08:56.990
the calcification,
scar tissue,

08:57.160 --> 08:58.380
and plaque encasing his skull

08:58.560 --> 09:00.470
before we can even
reach his brain.

09:09.840 --> 09:13.350
You can hear it, right?
They're getting louder.

09:13.880 --> 09:15.270
Closer.

09:17.880 --> 09:21.710
The war isn't going to end
unless somebody does something.

09:21.880 --> 09:23.710
But why does it have
to be you?

09:23.880 --> 09:24.830
They said I'm
the only soldier

09:25.040 --> 09:26.260
with the right mutation.

09:27.480 --> 09:30.270
It's called the Vara gene,
apparently.

09:30.840 --> 09:33.190
How does a mutation
end the war?

09:34.120 --> 09:35.510
I don't know.

09:36.440 --> 09:38.510
But if the Els believe
it can make a difference,

09:38.720 --> 09:40.950
I have to do whatever
I can to help.

09:43.240 --> 09:44.870
I'm sorry.

09:45.800 --> 09:47.670
It's just, uh...

09:47.840 --> 09:49.630
- Who you are.
- It's who I am.

09:53.120 --> 09:54.390
They said you could
withdraw anytime

09:54.560 --> 09:55.910
before the experiment's
commenced.

09:56.080 --> 09:58.110
Now, have you thought about
what that means, Dax?

10:01.240 --> 10:03.830
They wouldn't have that rule
unless they anticipated that--

10:04.040 --> 10:07.270
The subject would
be driven to abort.

10:08.480 --> 10:10.550
Don't call yourself that.

10:13.240 --> 10:16.190
Don't ever call yourself
the subject.

10:20.920 --> 10:22.630
You're my Dax.

10:25.680 --> 10:27.590
You're reading
too much into that.

10:29.040 --> 10:30.360
They want decisiveness.

10:33.240 --> 10:35.070
And what shall
I tell our daughter?

10:36.880 --> 10:38.670
Tell her her father
is helping to build

10:38.840 --> 10:39.980
a better tomorrow,

10:41.200 --> 10:44.430
so that she may grow up on
a peaceful Krypton once more.

10:44.600 --> 10:48.550
A Krypton that will never again
be marred in civil war.

10:49.960 --> 10:51.670
Apologies,
but time is precious.

10:51.840 --> 10:53.590
We must get started.

10:57.840 --> 10:59.550
End this war, love.

11:01.080 --> 11:02.430
Then come home.

11:04.240 --> 11:05.630
I will.

11:05.800 --> 11:07.150
I promise.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.670
Good-bye, Enaj.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.320
Good-bye, Dax.

11:32.160 --> 11:33.990
<i>So this is where
you'd like me to stand?</i>

11:35.720 --> 11:36.470
Here?

11:36.640 --> 11:38.310
That's quite all right,
Dax.

11:38.480 --> 11:39.830
My name is Van-Zod.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.030
I believe you've
already met Wedna-El.

11:42.520 --> 11:44.190
We'll be taking you
through this process.

11:45.160 --> 11:46.230
Okay.

11:47.600 --> 11:49.870
So, uh, what do you need
me to do?

11:50.240 --> 11:53.750
You did everything you needed
to when you signed up, Dax.

11:54.240 --> 11:55.750
You're a true hero.

11:56.120 --> 11:58.190
But if we're going
to win this war,

11:58.400 --> 11:59.750
you need to be more than that.

11:59.920 --> 12:02.590
We need to make
you more than that.

12:02.960 --> 12:05.270
What do you mean, exactly?

12:05.440 --> 12:08.910
Your unique genetic makeup,
it makes it possible for us

12:09.120 --> 12:11.500
to enhance your cellular
memory indefinitely.

12:11.680 --> 12:14.190
By exposing your cells
to different vulnerabilities,

12:14.360 --> 12:16.230
we will build up
your body's defenses

12:16.400 --> 12:18.990
until you're invulnerable
to all lethal force.

12:20.760 --> 12:23.320
You want to make me
a superhero?

12:24.920 --> 12:27.510
Are you ready to be one, Dax?

12:29.480 --> 12:30.390
Let's do it.

12:38.800 --> 12:41.950
Trial one,
test one initiated.

13:02.280 --> 13:03.750
It's a mine entrance.

13:04.520 --> 13:05.950
Fire Team One, scan it.

13:06.120 --> 13:07.670
Set a proximity charge
when you double back.

13:07.840 --> 13:09.160
Fire Team Two,
clear that pathway.

13:09.320 --> 13:10.710
- We've got your back.
- Yes, sir.

13:13.320 --> 13:14.150
What?

13:15.080 --> 13:16.910
What--what is it?
You--you're being strange.

13:17.080 --> 13:18.470
Earning your namesake,
honestly.

13:18.640 --> 13:20.230
Oh, I mean, just, you know,
look at you.

13:20.600 --> 13:22.950
I mean, six months ago
you were running a bar.

13:23.760 --> 13:25.270
God, not even a good one.

13:25.440 --> 13:26.910
I'm surprised you keep
the doors open.

13:27.080 --> 13:28.590
Okay, can I get an ETA on the
point you're trying to make?

13:28.760 --> 13:31.320
Okay, look, I'm trying to
give you a compliment, okay?

13:32.480 --> 13:34.990
It's a little hard.
I'm proud of you.

13:38.040 --> 13:39.430
You really stepped up, so--

13:39.600 --> 13:42.190
And you nearly stepped
on a landmine just now.

13:42.800 --> 13:44.870
- Are you serious?
- No.

13:45.040 --> 13:46.360
I'm not serious.

13:46.520 --> 13:47.790
That was a lesson.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.910
We've detected activity
in the mine ahead.

14:01.080 --> 14:03.510
Could be the Sagitari
we're looking for.

14:03.680 --> 14:04.710
All right.

14:04.880 --> 14:06.230
Let's regroup
and recon some more.

14:07.120 --> 14:09.910
If we recon, we risk losing
the element of surprise.

14:10.080 --> 14:11.400
We're heavily outnumbered here.

14:11.560 --> 14:12.830
So if we engage now,
then we can--

14:13.000 --> 14:15.350
No, we stick to protocol.
That's it.

14:16.280 --> 14:18.070
Now how about you show me
where they are?

14:21.440 --> 14:23.230
Yes.

14:35.680 --> 14:36.670
Is that what
we're looking for?

14:36.840 --> 14:38.110
The Nanites?

14:38.280 --> 14:39.500
This may prove
more complicated

14:39.680 --> 14:41.750
than I had
originally calculated.

14:41.920 --> 14:43.350
Of course it will.

14:44.760 --> 14:46.190
What's the problem this time?

14:46.400 --> 14:48.390
The cluster rests
upon your brain stem.

14:53.840 --> 14:55.060
Well.

14:55.680 --> 14:58.140
It was put there by an alien
called Brainiac, so...

14:59.120 --> 15:00.830
sounds about right to me.

15:01.040 --> 15:03.230
Besides, we're not exactly
swimming in options here.

15:04.560 --> 15:06.030
So let's get it done.

15:09.640 --> 15:10.960
Are you sure?

15:11.920 --> 15:13.550
We have to try.

16:01.880 --> 16:02.590
Seg, no!

16:04.800 --> 16:06.670
<i>I am sorry,
Seg-El, but you know</i>

16:06.840 --> 16:09.790
<i>I cannot allow you
to complete this procedure.</i>

16:09.960 --> 16:11.430
It's not me.
It's Brainiac.

16:11.600 --> 16:13.670
He's taking more control
of my body.

16:14.240 --> 16:15.870
You're gonna have
to restrain me.

16:18.600 --> 16:20.110
We'll have
to do this manually.

16:20.440 --> 16:21.310
Okay.

16:26.160 --> 16:27.110
Wait.

16:27.280 --> 16:28.830
You're not saying that I
have to do this, are you?

16:29.000 --> 16:31.030
Because that would be
a really bad idea.

16:31.440 --> 16:32.190
Really bad.

16:32.360 --> 16:34.310
Have you used
a sonic scalpel?

16:34.480 --> 16:36.070
- All the time.
- Excellent.

16:36.240 --> 16:37.670
- You'll need to--
- No, I'm being sarcastic.

16:37.840 --> 16:40.870
Of course I've never used a--
whatever it is you call it.

16:41.280 --> 16:43.270
Sarcasm, I see.

16:43.840 --> 16:46.480
Well, without prior experience,
it will certainly be

16:46.640 --> 16:48.830
- more challenging.
- No.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.510
No, I'm not doing it.
I'm sorry.

16:52.280 --> 16:54.740
- There has to be another way.
- Nyssa.

16:55.840 --> 16:56.980
Nyssa, look at me.

16:59.680 --> 17:02.240
If there is anything for sure
that I know about you,

17:02.640 --> 17:05.349
it's that you can do anything
you set your mind to.

17:06.079 --> 17:08.030
Just believe in yourself...

17:08.480 --> 17:10.470
the way I've always
believed in you.

17:10.640 --> 17:12.190
And you're gonna be fine.

17:12.960 --> 17:15.829
Seg, that was
a lovely speech.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.670
But that is not gonna help me
slice you open

17:17.839 --> 17:20.270
and remove an alien parasite.
Be realistic.

17:21.599 --> 17:22.950
Realistic?

17:23.880 --> 17:25.670
If I asked you
to go up to Wegthor

17:25.839 --> 17:27.310
and double-cross the leaders
of the resistance

17:27.520 --> 17:29.550
and steal the Codex from under
the nose of Jax-Ur

17:29.720 --> 17:32.150
and bring it back to Krypton,
would you call that realistic?

17:35.400 --> 17:37.110
What if I asked you
to go to House Zod,

17:37.320 --> 17:40.510
walk in there unarmed,
take our child in your arms,

17:40.680 --> 17:42.510
and jump out of a window
onto a waiting skimmer

17:42.680 --> 17:44.230
that's gonna take you
away to freedom?

17:44.400 --> 17:45.750
Realistic or no?

17:48.680 --> 17:50.950
I know you've been struggling
with who you really are.

17:51.480 --> 17:53.190
What you're really capable of.

17:55.280 --> 17:58.790
But if you could see the person
that I see when I look at you,

17:59.800 --> 18:01.310
you'd never fear anything.

18:04.200 --> 18:06.660
How do you always know
the right thing to say?

18:08.160 --> 18:10.870
Well, being raised
in the Rankless District

18:11.040 --> 18:13.150
means you know how to talk
yourself out of trouble.

18:18.200 --> 18:19.710
Thank you, Seg,

18:20.520 --> 18:22.790
for always believing in me.

18:44.640 --> 18:45.830
Okay.

18:47.920 --> 18:49.240
I can do this.

18:59.080 --> 19:01.230
Slice
repeatedly to go deep enough

19:01.400 --> 19:02.790
beyond the muscle layers.

19:03.720 --> 19:07.990
Just don't go too deep or we
risk permanent brain injury,

19:08.160 --> 19:09.630
and/or paralysis.

19:13.960 --> 19:17.430
Hey, Nyssa, you just
remember what I said, okay?

19:18.360 --> 19:19.630
You can do this.

19:20.440 --> 19:23.030
Oh, and hey, if not,
it sounds like I'm gonna have

19:23.200 --> 19:25.950
a catastrophic brain injury,
so I probably won't be able

19:26.120 --> 19:27.190
to hold it against
you too much.

19:27.640 --> 19:30.070
More sarcasm.
Excellent.

19:30.360 --> 19:32.110
Shut up.

19:35.160 --> 19:37.030
Why is this taking so long?

19:37.200 --> 19:39.840
The scar tissue is so deep,
it makes mapping the brain

19:40.000 --> 19:43.350
incredibly challenging.
Memory's difficult to locate.

19:44.320 --> 19:45.230
Probe deeper.

19:46.680 --> 19:48.230
Without giving
any recovery time,

19:48.400 --> 19:51.190
we risk further damaging
Doomsday's ability to process.

19:51.560 --> 19:54.550
We are not doing this
so he can make speeches.

19:55.040 --> 19:56.710
Probe deeper.

20:02.720 --> 20:03.710
Found something.

20:05.520 --> 20:07.030
It's a memory sequence.

20:07.200 --> 20:08.550
But it's pretty entangled.

20:08.720 --> 20:10.630
It's registering
as very traumatic.

20:10.800 --> 20:11.630
Show me.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.550
<i>Subject is deceased.</i>

20:30.720 --> 20:33.590
<i>Time, 12:56.</i>

20:34.760 --> 20:36.430
Test one, failed.

20:36.600 --> 20:38.670
Administer resurrection
protocol.

21:08.760 --> 21:12.110
Initiative, trial one,
test two.

21:12.280 --> 21:14.740
Subject is conscious and alert.

21:15.200 --> 21:17.760
Wh--what did you do to me?

21:18.360 --> 21:20.870
Trial one,
test two initiated.

21:35.320 --> 21:37.830
Test two successful.

21:38.480 --> 21:39.870
Shall we move on?

21:41.920 --> 21:43.390
Trial two, test one.

21:53.200 --> 21:56.830
<i>Subject is deceased.
Time, 1:56.</i>

21:57.320 --> 21:59.510
Administer resurrection
protocol.

22:07.760 --> 22:11.150
<i>Pathogen level
within subject now critical.</i>

22:31.760 --> 22:35.390
<i>Subject is deceased.
Time, 5:34.</i>

22:35.560 --> 22:37.590
Test 105 failed.

22:37.760 --> 22:39.830
- Administer resurrection pro--
- No.

22:40.040 --> 22:42.600
- No what?
- No more.

22:42.760 --> 22:45.670
This isn't right, Wedna.
You know it isn't.

22:45.880 --> 22:47.470
What are you talking about?
We're almost there.

22:47.640 --> 22:50.150
Look at him.
Look at what we've done to him.

22:50.320 --> 22:52.550
- What we've turned him into.
- We have to keep going, Van.

22:52.760 --> 22:54.110
Our people are depending on us.

22:54.280 --> 22:56.920
Our people are fighting
this war without us.

22:57.280 --> 22:58.630
We should be up
there with them,

22:58.800 --> 23:01.110
alongside Jo-Mon and all
the other Els and Zods.

23:01.280 --> 23:03.740
They are being slaughtered
up there, Van!

23:03.920 --> 23:07.150
The only chance we have
of protecting Argo City

23:07.360 --> 23:09.790
from the Kandorians
is right here.

23:13.320 --> 23:16.710
I know it goes against
what we both stand for.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.470
But it's what must be done.

23:25.640 --> 23:28.020
I just wish there
was another way.

23:28.680 --> 23:30.110
There isn't.

23:31.680 --> 23:33.030
Not this time.

23:36.360 --> 23:39.430
Administer resurrection
protocol.

23:45.080 --> 23:47.670
Well done, Nyssa.
Place it in here.

23:47.840 --> 23:49.670
The Nanites are microscopic.

23:49.840 --> 23:51.710
Invisible to the naked eye.

23:52.720 --> 23:54.750
And there they are.

23:56.200 --> 23:57.230
Good.

23:57.960 --> 23:59.830
We can now release Seg
from his restraints.

24:06.080 --> 24:07.150
Nice work.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.320
Are you okay?

24:10.480 --> 24:12.150
Thanks to you.

24:22.120 --> 24:23.790
I mean it, Nyssa.

24:24.960 --> 24:26.150
Thank you.

24:34.000 --> 24:37.270
There is one more thing.
Cor.

24:41.040 --> 24:45.750
Ever since I've been back,
I've had Brainiac in here

24:45.960 --> 24:49.740
and, um, I'd like to
hold my son for the first time

24:49.960 --> 24:51.030
as the man I truly am.

24:53.120 --> 24:55.390
I think it's time Cor
met his dad properly.

25:11.320 --> 25:12.540
Hello, my son.

25:17.040 --> 25:19.110
Hello, my Cor-Vex.

25:20.600 --> 25:23.710
No, Seg.
I've been thinking.

25:26.040 --> 25:28.910
I don't want our son
to carry the Vex name.

25:29.280 --> 25:33.270
You were right about
what you said before.

25:33.840 --> 25:36.430
I have been struggling
with who I am.

25:37.600 --> 25:40.670
There's so much I've done
that I'm not proud of.

25:43.320 --> 25:48.310
So much of who I am
or who I was

25:49.400 --> 25:52.070
came from how I was raised
by my father.

25:54.320 --> 25:57.190
The Vex name is forever tainted
by what he did

25:57.360 --> 25:58.830
to the people of Kandor.

26:00.240 --> 26:02.350
But what my father did to me...

26:04.920 --> 26:06.950
I don't want that for him.

26:08.320 --> 26:10.780
I don't want that for our son.

26:11.840 --> 26:15.670
He shouldn't have to carry the
shameful history of House Vex.

26:16.320 --> 26:18.700
That family line ends with me.

26:21.840 --> 26:25.870
I want our son to be an El.

26:34.800 --> 26:36.070
Cor-El?

26:39.280 --> 26:40.750
If I might interject,

26:42.200 --> 26:44.550
traditionally when adopting
the El family name,

26:44.720 --> 26:47.510
it follows that your son should
also take the first name

26:47.880 --> 26:49.510
of one of his ancestors.

26:50.600 --> 26:54.550
Your great grandfather, Seg.
My father.

26:55.440 --> 26:56.910
A humble man.

26:57.600 --> 26:59.980
His achievements perhaps not
as grand as some of our more

27:00.160 --> 27:03.510
esteemed ancestors.
They might have been.

27:03.720 --> 27:05.550
But his focus was his family.

27:06.560 --> 27:10.150
He was kindhearted.
A brilliant scientist.

27:10.520 --> 27:12.900
And a wonderful father.

27:15.360 --> 27:17.190
It sounds perfect.

27:18.680 --> 27:19.630
Are you sure?

27:25.360 --> 27:26.710
My son,

27:28.880 --> 27:32.270
many years from now when they
tell the story of your life,

27:32.440 --> 27:35.110
all of your accomplishments
and achievements,

27:35.280 --> 27:36.870
they'll be telling the story...

27:39.360 --> 27:40.550
of Jor-El.

28:06.960 --> 28:09.420
- Hey, what happened?
- The scanner died.

28:09.600 --> 28:11.550
Must be the Stellarium
radiation.

28:13.280 --> 28:15.350
But you saw them?
The hostiles?

28:15.520 --> 28:16.910
I saw something, yeah.

28:17.080 --> 28:18.990
That's enough recon for me.
Let's get in there--

28:19.160 --> 28:20.070
No.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.470
I'm going in alone.

28:22.640 --> 28:23.830
Um...

28:25.760 --> 28:28.470
Okay, uh, is the Stellarium
radiation playing

28:28.680 --> 28:30.000
with your brain thoughts,
maybe?

28:30.160 --> 28:32.030
I don't think that
they're hostiles, Adam.

28:32.640 --> 28:34.590
Hey, come here, just--

28:34.760 --> 28:37.990
Hey so, like, maybe--
what if, right--

28:38.160 --> 28:42.350
hypothetically speaking, your,
um, hunch on this is, you know,

28:42.520 --> 28:44.870
absolutely without
a doubt 100% wrong?

28:45.040 --> 28:46.510
Yeah, well, thank you
for the confidence, Adam.

28:46.680 --> 28:47.820
Listen, as much
as I don't like her,

28:48.000 --> 28:49.110
maybe she's right, okay?

28:49.280 --> 28:50.270
You got a lot of lives
on your hands.

28:50.440 --> 28:51.990
Look, I know what's at stake!

28:54.520 --> 28:56.270
I've been in this
situation before,

28:56.440 --> 28:59.750
and I am not gonna let another
innocent person die

28:59.960 --> 29:02.870
because of your lack of faith
or anyone else's lack of faith.

29:03.040 --> 29:07.230
So please just for once
in your life listen to me

29:07.400 --> 29:08.990
and stay put.

29:10.400 --> 29:11.540
That's an order.

29:13.040 --> 29:14.230
I'll be back.

29:14.800 --> 29:15.750
Soon.

29:18.240 --> 29:19.350
Probably.

29:27.720 --> 29:28.990
Right there.

29:30.360 --> 29:33.270
More deep memories that--
according to the sensors--

29:33.440 --> 29:36.430
are registering even stronger
than the prior set.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.430
Thank you.
You can leave us now.

29:42.400 --> 29:44.430
You'll be summoned if needed.

29:58.440 --> 30:02.630
It is a great honor to be
in the presence of the bravest

30:02.800 --> 30:04.790
Kryptonian in history.

30:05.480 --> 30:07.470
And the most misunderstood.

30:08.680 --> 30:11.030
You sacrificed everything
for Krypton.

30:13.920 --> 30:15.510
You are a hero.

30:17.280 --> 30:20.190
In many ways,
we are like brothers,

30:20.560 --> 30:23.270
protecting Mother Krypton
at all costs.

30:24.400 --> 30:28.070
This is why we must
be alone in this moment.

30:33.280 --> 30:35.350
Such a fine specimen.

30:42.560 --> 30:47.150
Yet even the finest crafted
arrow is of little use

30:47.360 --> 30:48.790
without a target.

30:50.880 --> 30:56.990
You will fulfill your destiny
and protect Krypton.

30:59.800 --> 31:04.310
Initiative, trial 455,
test five.

31:07.080 --> 31:08.830
- Where is he?
- We're perfecting him.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.950
You have to understand.
We're this close.

31:11.120 --> 31:12.340
The war is over.

31:13.040 --> 31:14.870
Jo-Mon has brought peace
to Krypton,

31:15.040 --> 31:17.750
and yet you still keep
from me my husband.

31:18.280 --> 31:20.150
There will always be
another war.

31:20.600 --> 31:22.870
As long as resources remain
too scarce to support

31:23.040 --> 31:24.390
our city-states,

31:24.560 --> 31:26.030
Krypton will never
be truly free.

31:29.520 --> 31:34.390
Your husband, he is the key
to everything, Enaj.

31:34.560 --> 31:36.350
The evolution of our species.

31:36.520 --> 31:39.190
He is our path
to a better tomorrow.

31:39.360 --> 31:44.190
I don't care about tomorrow.
I want my husband right now.

31:45.120 --> 31:47.150
I can't let you do that.

31:47.320 --> 31:50.270
Your husband is mere
trials away

31:50.440 --> 31:52.900
from complete invulnerability.

31:53.480 --> 31:55.030
And I plan on
carrying them out,

31:55.200 --> 31:58.230
so if you're going to shoot me,
do it now.

31:58.920 --> 32:00.510
Or let me get back to work.

32:10.600 --> 32:12.670
Dax!
Dax, is--is that you?

32:12.840 --> 32:14.470
Dax?
Dax!

32:14.640 --> 32:16.550
Dax!

32:16.720 --> 32:18.110
- Let me in there!
- I can't!

32:18.280 --> 32:20.030
- It's too dangerous.
- Let me in there now!

32:20.200 --> 32:22.950
You don't understand!
He's not your husband anymore!

32:23.120 --> 32:24.190
What do you mean?

32:25.400 --> 32:27.510
What did you do to him?

32:27.680 --> 32:29.590
I'm sorry, Enaj.

32:30.240 --> 32:33.940
The Zods and the Els,
we--we failed you.

32:47.160 --> 32:49.750
Dax, no!

32:51.320 --> 32:52.110
Are you there?

32:55.560 --> 32:59.630
Please!
I need you!

33:05.120 --> 33:06.440
Please.

33:27.800 --> 33:29.550
Dax, what did they do to you?

33:56.520 --> 33:57.870
Enaj.

34:11.159 --> 34:12.550
Enaj?

34:21.880 --> 34:22.870
What do you think?

34:28.239 --> 34:30.350
Have you got one
in Jor-El's size?

34:37.480 --> 34:39.750
- What is it?
- Brainiac's Nanites.

34:39.920 --> 34:42.429
The cluster.
It's gone.

34:44.239 --> 34:45.150
Shit.

34:49.800 --> 34:51.230
How long are we
going to wait?

34:52.679 --> 34:54.030
Till he comes back.

34:54.239 --> 34:55.380
He could be dying in there.

34:55.679 --> 34:57.150
You want that
on your conscience?

34:58.880 --> 35:01.190
You can sit here doing nothing.
I'm going in.

35:01.360 --> 35:02.750
Whoa.
No, you are not.

35:05.920 --> 35:07.390
Get out the way.

35:07.760 --> 35:09.270
I don't take orders from you.

35:10.000 --> 35:11.030
No, you know what?
You don't.

35:13.160 --> 35:16.030
Then again I'm not the one who
gave the order to stand down.

35:16.680 --> 35:18.070
So stand down!

35:23.360 --> 35:27.590
So I'm gonna ask you one time
to sit your insubordinate ass

35:28.040 --> 35:30.630
down over there and wait
for your commander.

35:32.720 --> 35:34.070
Shit.

35:34.240 --> 35:35.560
Get down on the ground!

35:36.400 --> 35:37.190
On the ground!

35:37.400 --> 35:38.670
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hold your fire!

35:38.840 --> 35:40.670
Hold your fire!
Put your weapon down.

35:40.800 --> 35:42.390
These Sagitari have
all been exposed

35:42.560 --> 35:43.910
to high levels of Stellarium.

35:44.120 --> 35:45.030
They're too ill to get back
to their base

35:45.240 --> 35:46.590
for medicine and food.

35:46.760 --> 35:49.710
So everybody please
hand over your meals.

35:49.880 --> 35:51.150
Quickly.
Come on.

35:56.120 --> 35:57.310
What are you waiting for?

36:00.400 --> 36:01.950
You heard your commander.

36:02.880 --> 36:03.910
Hand over your meals.

36:13.360 --> 36:14.910
How did you know
that they needed help?

36:15.080 --> 36:18.780
I mean, I didn't fully,
but before the scanner

36:18.960 --> 36:20.710
fritzed out I noticed that
their heat signature

36:20.840 --> 36:23.750
was oddly dim,
and Stellarium mines don't

36:23.920 --> 36:25.590
have that effect
on the readings.

36:25.760 --> 36:29.310
But I--I just think growing up
in the Rankless District,

36:29.480 --> 36:32.470
I know what hunger looks like,
so yeah.

36:32.640 --> 36:34.470
Anyway, let's feed
these people.

36:49.920 --> 36:52.150
Kem.
You found them.

36:52.880 --> 36:56.270
Yeah, hiding in a mine
exposed to Stellarium.

36:56.480 --> 36:59.230
Zod sent them there during
the negotiations for Lyta.

36:59.440 --> 37:00.710
Told them to wait
for further commands,

37:00.880 --> 37:03.520
but they never came.
He abandoned them.

37:03.680 --> 37:04.630
Mmm.

37:05.360 --> 37:07.740
- Casualties?
- None.

37:07.920 --> 37:10.510
Thanks to this guy.
Mmm?

37:10.680 --> 37:12.830
Okay, okay.
That's enough.

37:13.040 --> 37:14.390
I mean, they needed help.

37:14.560 --> 37:16.350
And they weren't getting it
from General Zod.

37:16.520 --> 37:18.070
So I told them that
they could find it here.

37:18.560 --> 37:20.030
- Indeed.
- Yeah.

37:20.520 --> 37:21.390
Well done, Kem.

37:21.560 --> 37:25.110
Hey, Val,
a little respect here.

37:26.080 --> 37:28.270
Well done, commander.

37:35.240 --> 37:38.870
Hey, sergeant, let's get
these folks to medical.

37:39.040 --> 37:40.150
Yes, sir.

37:40.360 --> 37:42.790
Uh, hey, um--uh, Kem.

37:45.760 --> 37:48.190
Just want to say
that I'm sorry.

37:49.840 --> 37:52.750
I'm sorry.
I know I rode you hard earlier.

37:53.200 --> 37:55.230
Yep, like goddamn Seabiscuit.

37:56.360 --> 37:57.350
- What?
- Never mind.

37:57.520 --> 37:58.790
Just keep going.

37:59.880 --> 38:01.230
You did well.

38:01.720 --> 38:04.360
You know, in as far as not
getting yourself, me,

38:04.520 --> 38:06.230
or any of my squad
horribly killed.

38:06.400 --> 38:08.860
Oh, it's not that hard
once you get the hang of it.

38:10.320 --> 38:11.590
Thanks for backing me up.

38:13.760 --> 38:16.830
- Sneeze brisket, huh?
- That's not the--no.

38:17.280 --> 38:19.790
Wasn't it?
I heard sneeze brisket.

38:20.400 --> 38:23.110
We've scanned the fortress
three times now.

38:23.320 --> 38:26.390
There's absolutely no trace
of Brainiac's Nanites within.

38:29.240 --> 38:30.310
Unless...

38:32.000 --> 38:33.550
Seg, what is it?

38:33.720 --> 38:36.030
Unless it's already found
its way into one of us.

38:36.760 --> 38:37.750
No.

38:37.960 --> 38:39.790
No, how could it
do that so fast?

38:40.240 --> 38:41.910
And we'd feel it, right?

38:42.280 --> 38:44.660
I don't know.
It's bio-digital.

38:46.440 --> 38:48.590
You have its signature
from the refractor, right?

38:49.360 --> 38:50.030
Yes.

38:50.200 --> 38:52.760
Could you scan us for any
trace of digital parasite?

38:52.920 --> 38:54.670
Yes, I--I could.

38:56.280 --> 38:57.870
Start with Jor.

39:07.640 --> 39:09.790
There is no parasitic
presence detected

39:09.960 --> 39:10.830
within Jor-El.

39:15.280 --> 39:16.750
Scan Nyssa.

39:22.320 --> 39:24.150
There is no parasitic
presence detected

39:24.320 --> 39:25.390
within Nyssa-Vex.

39:31.920 --> 39:33.190
Then it has to be me.

39:35.840 --> 39:37.060
No.
You don't know that.

39:37.240 --> 39:38.380
- Run the scan.
- Nyssa.

39:38.600 --> 39:40.190
No, Seg, we've only
just got you back.

39:40.360 --> 39:43.270
- It's gonna be okay.
- Seg, Nyssa's right.

39:43.480 --> 39:45.470
We can't be sure until
we run the scan.

39:46.080 --> 39:49.430
For all we know, Brainiac's
Nanites coul--coul--

40:06.280 --> 40:08.840
Mmm.

40:22.480 --> 40:23.700
What are you doing?

40:23.880 --> 40:25.200
Scramble the skimmers.

40:25.400 --> 40:27.070
I want them in the sky now!

40:36.520 --> 40:41.270
Had you taken me to my ship
per our arrangement,

40:41.440 --> 40:45.390
all this could
have been avoided, Seg-El.

40:45.560 --> 40:47.990
We both know you want more
than the Skull Ship, Brainiac.

40:48.160 --> 40:50.910
Is that why you reneged
on our arrangement?

40:51.240 --> 40:55.120
You thought I was going
to complete my acquisition

40:55.280 --> 40:58.510
of Kandor City?
A logical assumption.

40:58.960 --> 41:03.030
But my designs to preserve
Krypton have been amended.

41:03.480 --> 41:06.910
They no longer involve
Kandor City at all.

41:11.040 --> 41:12.870
I don't believe you.

41:14.600 --> 41:17.990
That is of no consequence.

41:19.240 --> 41:22.070
I suggest you stand back.

41:27.920 --> 41:31.620
There is no greater power

41:32.640 --> 41:34.750
than the universe.

41:35.080 --> 41:40.200
Come with me and discover it
in ways a Kryptonian

41:40.360 --> 41:42.350
can only dream of.

41:45.600 --> 41:47.750
All that time inside my head
and you still don't understand

41:47.920 --> 41:49.790
the first thing about me.

41:50.960 --> 41:53.070
Let me spell it out for you.

41:53.280 --> 41:57.430
I do not crave power
to destroy the way you do.

41:59.320 --> 42:01.990
It is you who fails
to understand me.

42:02.600 --> 42:07.620
I seek only to preserve
the unique cultures that exist

42:07.800 --> 42:09.590
within this universe,

42:09.760 --> 42:13.790
saving them from
their own inevitably

42:13.960 --> 42:16.630
self-destructive impulses.

42:16.840 --> 42:18.550
You can call it
what you want.

42:18.760 --> 42:21.790
But you are a monster
who sees yourself as a god.

42:23.960 --> 42:26.150
And I will never join you,
Brainiac.

42:28.800 --> 42:34.550
Your choice is as illogical
as it is unfortunate.

42:35.400 --> 42:38.230
But you have earned
the right to make it.

42:39.000 --> 42:41.510
Good-bye, Seg-El.

42:57.560 --> 43:00.790
<i>My directive is
as it always was--</i>

43:00.960 --> 43:03.950
<i>to preserve the best
of Krypton.</i>

43:04.120 --> 43:06.310
<i>I once believed
it was Kandor City.</i>

43:06.520 --> 43:11.150
<i>Now I believe that the best of
Krypton lies within the blood</i>

43:11.320 --> 43:12.830
<i>of the Els.</i>

43:15.600 --> 43:17.270
- No, no, Nyssa, no!
- No!

43:17.440 --> 43:18.990
No!

43:29.600 --> 43:34.470
No, let me go!
You said this wouldn't happen!
