03:04.666 --> 03:09.666
Stacy, I've loved you since the first time
I saw you in the temple's Purim Pageant.

03:09.666 --> 03:13.166
You were the finest Queen Esther
I ever laid eyes on.

03:13.166 --> 03:17.791
Is it okay if I officially signify me
being your boyfriend by giving you a kiss?

03:21.625 --> 03:23.625
Consent given, Andy Goldfarb.

03:27.500 --> 03:29.250
-  Stacy!

03:31.208 --> 03:33.500
Stacy,
we're gonna be late. Let's go.

03:38.041 --> 03:40.041
-  I know you can hear me.

03:40.041 --> 03:43.625
One second,
I'm flossing like you tell me to!

03:43.625 --> 03:46.250
- Now I'm gurgling.
- Well, hurry up!

03:46.250 --> 03:48.458
- You too, Ronnie!
-  I'm ready!

03:48.458 --> 03:50.958
You always say that. Never ready.

03:50.958 --> 03:53.708
- Ugh. Fine you got me. I'm not ready.
-  Yankees are winning.

03:54.375 --> 03:55.750
That's what you're wearing?

03:55.750 --> 03:58.375
Yeah, I don't even know who this kid is.
I'm not gonna wear a suit.

03:58.375 --> 04:01.333
It's a junior high friend.
We have to get to know those parents too.

04:01.333 --> 04:03.833
I don't want to get to know 'em.
I liked when they were little.

04:03.833 --> 04:06.291
All we had to know was them
and the trampoline park guy.

04:06.291 --> 04:07.625
Ronnie, we're gonna be late!

04:07.625 --> 04:09.958
I'll be ready when Stacy's ready, Mom.
It's all good.

04:11.125 --> 04:14.250
Hey, Andy, of course I'll share
a matzo ball soup with you.

04:18.208 --> 04:19.791
Hi, Andy. I like your yarmulke.

04:19.791 --> 04:22.333
I didn't know you were going
to the Bat Mitzvah tonight, that's cool.

04:22.333 --> 04:23.958
Honey, what are you looking for?

04:23.958 --> 04:25.208
I can't find my earring.

04:25.208 --> 04:27.000
Oh, good luck.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.125
Keep looking, baby.
Keep looking. Take your time.

04:30.125 --> 04:31.458
Stacy!

04:31.458 --> 04:33.083
Sorry, I'm coming!

04:44.125 --> 04:45.375
Those are cool.

04:45.375 --> 04:48.416
- Mom will never let you wear them, though.
-  She won't even notice.

04:48.416 --> 04:50.791
And if she does,
I'll put on a sad show for Dad.

04:50.791 --> 04:52.583
Oh, she'll notice. She'll hate them.

04:52.583 --> 04:56.208
And Dad will feel bad, but ultimately
be too afraid to stand up to Mom.

04:56.208 --> 04:57.875
I've known them longer than you.

05:00.041 --> 05:03.500
Um, excuse me,
what are those things on your feet?

05:03.500 --> 05:06.083
Lydia's mom bought us each a pair,
so we could twin.

05:06.083 --> 05:07.458
What's twin?

05:07.458 --> 05:09.500
Wearing the same thing.
It's very seventh grade.

05:09.500 --> 05:11.333
Take them off. You look like a stripper.

05:11.333 --> 05:14.083
- Mom, you can't say that.
- Yeah, Mom. You're gonna get cancelled.

05:14.083 --> 05:15.125
Oh boy.

05:15.125 --> 05:17.458
Take them off or lose your phone.

05:25.958 --> 05:26.791
Oh.

05:29.375 --> 05:31.500
No, you can't. Just take them off.

05:31.500 --> 05:32.916
Everyone in the car.

05:32.916 --> 05:35.583
Thirty seconds or there's going
to be no food left at this thing.

05:35.583 --> 05:37.458
You're the one who's not ready.
We're ready.

05:37.458 --> 05:40.750
- I don't know where my earring is.
- Babe, did you look everywhere? Honestly?

05:40.750 --> 05:43.083
'Cause if you look hard enough,
you can find it.

05:43.083 --> 05:44.625
Why would you do that to me?

05:44.625 --> 05:46.666
Because I knew the girls needed more time.

05:46.666 --> 05:48.875
I also... I don't want to go
to this thing at all.

05:48.875 --> 05:50.791
-  You guys are the worst.
- Yeah. I love you. Okay.

05:50.791 --> 05:52.333
Come on, Mom, just let her wear the shoes.

05:52.333 --> 05:54.625
It's not fair to Lydia
to make her wear them by herself.

05:54.625 --> 05:57.708
Okay. You're going to hate them
in two minutes.

05:58.458 --> 05:59.708
You're welcome.

05:59.708 --> 06:00.958
Thank you. Love you.

06:07.708 --> 06:10.125
- Whoa. Ow!
-  Stacy!

06:10.125 --> 06:11.625
I'm coming!

06:12.750 --> 06:13.958
Ugh, fine.

06:18.541 --> 06:19.916
Move, child!

06:19.916 --> 06:21.041

-  Hi, Lyd!
- Lydia, Lydia encyclopedia.

06:35.833 --> 06:36.833

06:36.833 --> 06:38.458

06:38.458 --> 06:40.958
Oh, thanks, Ron Ron.
Stacy and I are twinning.

06:40.958 --> 06:41.958

06:41.958 --> 06:43.625
Hmm. Not anymore.

06:44.291 --> 06:45.875
- You took yours off.
- I got you.

06:45.875 --> 06:49.041
- Oh, thank you. I couldn't feel my feet.
- Mom and Dad know we're taking you?

06:49.041 --> 06:52.333
Well, I told my mom, and then she told
Dad's lawyer, so we're good to go.

06:55.125 --> 06:56.250
Nice!

06:57.208 --> 06:59.750
Ugh! Dad, can you turn this song off?
It's embarrassing.

06:59.750 --> 07:02.000
Why is it embarrassing?
No one's around to hear it.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.083
Oh my God! You're humiliating me!

07:04.083 --> 07:07.041
All right! I'll turn it off. Jesus.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
I turned it off, guys!
What are we still upset about?

07:12.000 --> 07:14.958
Their watching sad videos
to see who can cry first.

07:16.125 --> 07:19.625
You're trying to cry. That is so bizarre.

Ugh! You're so freaking good at this game.

07:29.708 --> 07:31.708

11:51.583 --> 11:54.333
-  Let me hear you scream, Schmu...
-  Ley!

11:54.333 --> 11:55.666
- Schmu--
-  Ley!

11:55.666 --> 11:56.916
- Schmu, Schmu--
-  Ley!

11:56.916 --> 11:59.083
Why does everybody like this idiot?

11:59.083 --> 12:00.750
- He's the best!
- The best.

12:00.750 --> 12:05.166
- You've been officially Schmulitized!

12:06.583 --> 12:08.458
Thank you family
for joining us today.

12:10.291 --> 12:12.500
Let me take you all on a journey.

12:12.500 --> 12:15.500
Picture this. My entrance video starts...

12:16.333 --> 12:19.125
Which, as we know,
sets the tone for the entire Bat Mitzvah.

12:19.125 --> 12:21.083
-  Mm-hmm.

12:21.083 --> 12:23.083
-  Ugh, Ronnie!
- Girls, come on.

12:23.083 --> 12:27.375
Anyway, I descend the stairs
of a private yacht on the Hudson River

12:27.375 --> 12:29.416
to cheers and fireworks.

12:29.416 --> 12:30.666
Whoa.

12:30.666 --> 12:33.166
Then! Oh, who's that zipping by
on a jet ski?

12:33.750 --> 12:36.791
Why that's international recording artist
Olivia Rodrigo.

12:36.791 --> 12:38.791
Wait, how we gonna pay for this?

12:38.791 --> 12:39.708
Oh, we have ideas.

12:39.708 --> 12:41.250
They... they got ideas, honey.

12:41.250 --> 12:42.458
Okay.

12:43.583 --> 12:46.541
No. Wait. No. The old guy
was supposed to be for your dad.

12:46.541 --> 12:47.833
Oh no. Just keep going.

12:49.708 --> 12:50.541
- There.
- Okay.

12:50.541 --> 12:52.666
Oh, this is amazing.

12:52.666 --> 12:54.458
- Shut up, Ronnie.
- No, you shut up.

12:54.458 --> 12:55.583
I'll kill you, Ronnie.

12:55.583 --> 12:57.375
Not if I stab you first!

12:57.375 --> 12:58.666
Oh, that's... that's nice.

12:58.666 --> 13:02.333
Oh my God, this is important!
I'm becoming a freaking woman, everyone!

13:02.333 --> 13:05.750
Okay, woman. All you should worry about
right now is your mitzvah project

13:05.750 --> 13:07.250
and practicing your <i>Haftarah.</i>

13:07.250 --> 13:09.166
-  Mm-hmm.
- That's not important!

13:10.916 --> 13:14.625
I mean, it is important to you
and other old people and God and stuff.

13:14.625 --> 13:17.291
But to me, the party is important.

13:17.291 --> 13:20.416
If this doesn't go well,
I could end up like Kate Kossman.

13:20.416 --> 13:22.208
You are not gonna end up
like Kate Kossman.

13:22.208 --> 13:23.583
Who's Kate Kossman?

13:23.583 --> 13:27.291
Oh, she had this terrible medieval themed
Bat Mitzvah called Kate Kossman Knights,

13:27.291 --> 13:29.625
not realizing
the initials spelled out KKK.

13:29.625 --> 13:31.666
Yeah, no, I could see
that being a problem. Okay.

13:31.666 --> 13:34.750
So now, she just sits alone in
the cafeteria sewing friendship bracelets

13:34.750 --> 13:38.250
for literally no one
because she has no friends.

13:38.250 --> 13:39.625
That sounds a little dramatic.

13:39.625 --> 13:43.291
Oh, so you think you shouldn't be
punished for promoting the KKK.

13:43.291 --> 13:45.750
Wow, Mom,
didn't realize you supported racism.

13:45.750 --> 13:46.750
Oh boy.

13:46.750 --> 13:47.833
Hear me out.

13:47.833 --> 13:50.916
You're always saying how my Bat Mitzvah
determines the rest of my life.

13:50.916 --> 13:53.041
And I think Dua Lipa
would make my life perfect.

13:53.041 --> 13:56.625
No. No famous pop stars,
no yachts, no sailboats even.

13:56.625 --> 13:59.250
That's so unfair!
Ronnie got a baked potato bar at hers!

13:59.250 --> 14:02.666
Listen, when I got Bar Mitzvahed,
we had a party in Grandma's basement.

14:02.666 --> 14:04.750
We all split, like, this giant matzo ball.

14:04.750 --> 14:05.666
That was the fun.

14:05.666 --> 14:07.958
You know what the theme was? Being Jewish.

14:07.958 --> 14:10.750
Just practice your prayers
and write your speech already.

14:10.750 --> 14:13.166
Oh, I've been doing that Mr. Friedman.
It's all covered.

14:13.166 --> 14:15.416
You're writing Stacy's speech?

14:15.416 --> 14:18.041
- You know I'm not good at writing.
- English is her worst subject.

14:18.041 --> 14:19.291
It's really bad.

14:19.291 --> 14:21.416
- Stacy, that is so not okay.
-  It's fine.

14:21.416 --> 14:24.583
She's gonna do my entrance video.
I know she'll crush it. Don't worry.

14:25.750 --> 14:27.916
Can I at least have a virgin mojito bar?

14:27.916 --> 14:29.458
You can have a ball pit.

14:29.458 --> 14:31.166
Oh my God, Dad. That's for kids!

14:31.166 --> 14:33.375
I've had my period for seven months now!

14:33.375 --> 14:35.083
Wait, Stacy.

14:35.083 --> 14:36.916
That's a long period, sweetheart!

14:38.833 --> 14:40.375
You know what? I'm gonna head out.

14:40.375 --> 14:41.500
I'll drive you.

14:41.500 --> 14:43.166
Love you. See you in the morning.

14:43.166 --> 14:44.958
Don't worry, Dad. It'll be okay.

14:45.458 --> 14:47.500
She's growing up so fast. It's crazy.

14:47.500 --> 14:48.791
I'm drinking now.

14:48.791 --> 14:51.625
I tried it the other day.
I didn't like it. We're good.

14:54.916 --> 14:57.333
<i>Va-y'chal Mosh--</i>

14:57.333 --> 14:59.958
-  <i>Va-y'chal...</i>

14:59.958 --> 15:01.500
<i>Dear God, what's up?</i>

15:01.500 --> 15:04.416
<i>Stacy Friedman here,
but I guess you already know that.</i>

15:04.916 --> 15:07.416
<i>And I guess you already know
what I'm going to say.</i>

15:08.000 --> 15:11.375
<i>But just to be super safe,
I'm going to say it anyway.</i>

15:11.875 --> 15:15.958
<i>I would really, really appreciate it
if I could have an amazing Bat Mitzvah.</i>

15:17.375 --> 15:19.666
<i>And I know I need
to do my mitzvah project.</i>

15:19.666 --> 15:24.166
<i>But isn't a mitzvah project supposed to be
giving back in a way that represents me?</i>

15:24.166 --> 15:26.125
<i>Which is why I don't know what to do.</i>

15:26.833 --> 15:28.208
<i>I mean, I'm not popular.</i>

15:28.208 --> 15:29.750
<i>I'm not a loser.</i>

15:31.333 --> 15:33.291
<i>I don't know who I am.</i>

15:34.250 --> 15:37.291
<i>But I do know,
if I have a kick-ass Bat Mitzvah,</i>

15:37.291 --> 15:41.291
<i>doors would open,
and I can have a fab life on my own terms.</i>

15:41.291 --> 15:43.125
<i>No. No famous pop stars.</i>

15:43.125 --> 15:44.458
<i>You can have a ball pit.</i>

15:44.458 --> 15:47.416
<i>A ball pit? Lydia's
gonna get everything she asked for.</i>

15:47.416 --> 15:49.416
<i>Even a Twizzlers station for me.</i>

15:49.958 --> 15:52.125
<i>I'm starting
to worry Mom and Dad don't get it,</i>

15:52.125 --> 15:54.166
<i>and the whole thing's gonna suck.</i>

16:00.791 --> 16:04.125
-  You had her phone the whole time?
-  No, she was lying.

16:04.125 --> 16:05.625
- The audacity.
- The monster.

16:05.625 --> 16:06.875
Yeah.

16:06.875 --> 16:08.791
- Can we sit outside? It's a nice day.
- No.

16:08.791 --> 16:10.541
I mean, I definitely could use some color.

16:10.541 --> 16:13.041
- Yeah, it's true.
- Is that Tory Burch?

16:13.041 --> 16:17.250
Oh no, it's Walmart. I got this
and a water bottle for only $12.

16:17.250 --> 16:18.583
I was talking to her.

16:21.291 --> 16:22.625
M-me?

16:22.625 --> 16:23.750
Your skirt.

16:23.750 --> 16:26.083
Uh, yeah, it is Tory Burch.

16:26.083 --> 16:29.750
My mom is trying to spend all
my dad's money before the next court date.

16:30.833 --> 16:33.458
I'm pretty sure I saw Hailey Bieber
wearing the exact same one.

16:33.458 --> 16:36.000
Oh cool. Okay. Bye.

16:38.625 --> 16:39.791
That was weird.

16:39.791 --> 16:42.791
- I love and hate them at the same time.
-  Yeah.

16:42.791 --> 16:44.333
What just happened?

16:53.958 --> 16:55.458
<i>♪ Wait a minute ♪</i>

16:55.958 --> 17:00.291
<i>♪ I think I left my conscience

17:01.833 --> 17:03.500

17:05.958 --> 17:09.250
So get this. I heard Megan's
doing her mitzvah project next weekend.

17:09.250 --> 17:10.916
She's passing out sunscreen at Coachella.

17:10.916 --> 17:12.875
- What? Wow.
-  So cool.

17:12.875 --> 17:14.750
Guys, I have to come up
with something amazing.

17:14.750 --> 17:16.083
This is so much pressure.

17:16.083 --> 17:19.583
How long do you think it takes to become
a social activist influencer on TikTok?

17:19.583 --> 17:21.083
Uh, six months?

17:21.083 --> 17:22.458
Too long.

17:23.125 --> 17:25.416
You know what?
We just need to chill our brains.

17:25.416 --> 17:27.916
What are you doing Saturday?
My mom's out of town this weekend.

17:27.916 --> 17:29.250
Why? You gonna throw a party?

17:29.250 --> 17:30.291
A dork party?

17:32.500 --> 17:33.458
What if I did?

17:33.958 --> 17:36.125
Well, I mean, my dad's out of town.

17:36.125 --> 17:38.166
Now, you could actually throw a party.

17:38.166 --> 17:41.166
You could invite the whole seventh grade
and not exclude anybody.

17:41.166 --> 17:45.500
Oh, come on. Wouldn't it be fun to exclude
people instead of being excluded for once?

17:59.375 --> 18:00.416
Heads up!

18:01.875 --> 18:03.375
<i>Ay dios mío.</i>

18:03.875 --> 18:06.166
Stace, Stace, Stace, Stace? Are you okay?

18:06.166 --> 18:07.958
- Oh shit.

18:07.958 --> 18:09.416
That doesn't look good.

18:09.416 --> 18:10.791
You have grass in your hair.

18:10.791 --> 18:12.041
Stacy.

18:12.041 --> 18:13.291
Are you okay?

18:13.291 --> 18:14.625
That's my bad!

18:16.750 --> 18:17.791
You good?

18:22.416 --> 18:23.583
Yeah. Sorry about that.

18:28.875 --> 18:30.458
- Have some water.

18:32.541 --> 18:33.916
Oh my God. That was perfect.

18:33.916 --> 18:35.250
He went... And then you went.

18:35.250 --> 18:37.583
- You guys are meant to be.

18:37.583 --> 18:39.500
Hey, are your legs okay, Nikki?

18:40.750 --> 18:42.458
They're fine, Mateo. Just relax.

18:52.500 --> 18:53.333
Really?

18:53.333 --> 18:57.125
Oh, by the way, Dad invited
the dry cleaner to the Bat Mitzvah, Stacy.

18:57.125 --> 18:58.833
What? No, that's so unfair.

18:58.833 --> 19:02.333
The ratio to old people to normal people
is already so unbalanced.

19:02.333 --> 19:04.916
Why is that kid Mateo going
to Hebrew school?

19:05.833 --> 19:09.208
Maybe he wanted to convert
and take some Jewish holidays off?

19:10.625 --> 19:12.125
You gonna invite him, Stace?

19:12.125 --> 19:13.666
Mateo? No, I barely know him.

19:13.666 --> 19:16.041
You know, if you invite Mateo,
Andy might come.

19:20.875 --> 19:22.500
Have fun learning!

19:22.500 --> 19:24.208
Love you!

19:26.291 --> 19:27.625
Oh shit!

19:30.041 --> 19:31.250
Are you on dru--

19:31.250 --> 19:33.333
<i>Take me to your best friend's house</i>

19:33.333 --> 19:37.666
<i>Goin' round this roundabout, oh yeah</i>

19:39.208 --> 19:41.291
-  Thank you.
-  Good job, guys.

19:41.875 --> 19:43.000
<i>- Manishmah.</i>
- Hi.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.583
- Shalom, you two.
- Shalom.

19:44.583 --> 19:47.416
Oh, this looks really good.
I am not that creative...

19:47.416 --> 19:49.458
I was not good at arts and crafts,
like, at all.

19:49.458 --> 19:51.250
- I like your outfit, Ashley.
- Thank you.

19:51.250 --> 19:52.541
Oh yeah, it's really cute.

19:52.541 --> 19:54.750
Look who's coming out
of the make out closet.

19:54.750 --> 19:56.375
Oh my God,
were they hooking up in there?

19:56.375 --> 19:59.583
How do they not get caught?
There's literally so many people around.

20:00.416 --> 20:05.083
Would you believe when I was your age,
I was in a Jewish rock and roll band?

20:05.083 --> 20:10.041
We called ourselves Exodus
because Genesis was already taken.

20:10.875 --> 20:12.250
I'm sorry, Aaron, am I boring you?

20:12.250 --> 20:14.666
What? No--
I was listening, Cantor Jerry.

20:14.666 --> 20:15.791
Stace, Lyd!

20:16.916 --> 20:19.208
- You look so cute. You guys good?
-  Yes.

20:19.208 --> 20:20.958
- The pole!
- Pole!

20:21.750 --> 20:23.500
Oh, wait, how's your Torah portion going?

20:23.500 --> 20:25.291
It's like 6,000 pages long.

20:25.291 --> 20:27.958
Why did my parents pick
the third week of August?

20:27.958 --> 20:31.666
But mine's literally, like, a minute
and a half long. Thank you, June 10th!

20:32.291 --> 20:35.000
Chop-chop, ladies! Curtain's up in five!

20:35.000 --> 20:38.916
I like to think of Hebrew school
as a little performance I give.

20:38.916 --> 20:42.666
Your prayer book is the playbill,
and I'm the star, cutie-pops.

20:43.583 --> 20:46.708
Giving you a bit of the ole razzle-dazzle.
You know what I'm saying?

20:46.708 --> 20:48.625
Kidding. Come one, class is starting.
Let's go!

20:48.625 --> 20:49.791
Rabbi Rebecca!

20:49.791 --> 20:52.083
- Can we please have snacks?
- You want some latkes and gefilte fish?

20:52.083 --> 20:53.083
She's insane.

20:53.083 --> 20:54.541
I know. I love her.

20:54.541 --> 20:56.875
"And I'm the star,
cutie-pops, razzle-dazzle."

20:56.875 --> 20:58.291
- Very nice.
- Very good.

20:58.291 --> 20:59.708
Thank you. Thank you very much.

21:00.833 --> 21:03.125
- Is she serious? Oh my God.
- I know, right?

21:03.125 --> 21:05.958
I really want a cloud.
Like, I want to taste a cloud.

21:05.958 --> 21:08.333
- You want what?
- I want to taste a cloud.

21:08.333 --> 21:09.833
I want to taste a cloud. That's all.

21:09.833 --> 21:11.791
-  It seems--
-  Yo. You good, bro?

21:15.333 --> 21:16.875
Yeah. Why?

21:16.875 --> 21:19.041
Uh, your head from earlier.

21:19.041 --> 21:20.416
Head injuries are no joke.

21:20.416 --> 21:23.166
One time I barfed at soccer
from a concussion.

21:24.500 --> 21:25.333
Did you barf?

21:25.958 --> 21:27.791
No. I didn't.

21:28.291 --> 21:29.208
Tight.

21:33.750 --> 21:36.375
- All right, shabbat shalom!
-  Shabbat shalom.

21:36.375 --> 21:39.666
How's everyone feeling?
We having the time of our lives right now?

21:39.666 --> 21:41.666
You guys start your mitzvah projects yet?

21:41.666 --> 21:43.541
-  No.
- Yeah.

21:43.541 --> 21:47.625
No? It's the most important part
of this whole thing.

21:47.625 --> 21:52.958
It's when you do something menschie
for your community, for society at-large.

21:52.958 --> 21:56.041
What? You guys don't care
about society at-large?

21:56.041 --> 21:57.916
-  No.
- Yeah.

21:57.916 --> 22:02.583
All right, how about we pick up where
we left off with our old buddy, David.

22:02.583 --> 22:03.708
Remember him?

22:03.708 --> 22:08.541
Homeboy was about to get his groove on
with the foxy Bathsheba

22:08.541 --> 22:10.958
even though she was married
to someone else.

22:10.958 --> 22:13.500
What a snake David is!

22:13.500 --> 22:14.666
You a snake, Aaron?

22:16.041 --> 22:16.958
N-no.

22:16.958 --> 22:19.166
You ever pull something like that?
Cheat on your wife?

22:21.541 --> 22:25.625
- M-me?
- Dude, I'm messing around with you. Relax!

22:25.625 --> 22:27.833
You're sweating, my goodness.

22:27.833 --> 22:29.833
You're not a snake, Aaron. You're awesome.

22:29.833 --> 22:31.916
Look at that arm hair
and mustache coming in strong.

22:31.916 --> 22:33.916
<i>Baruch HaShem,</i> Aaron. Let's go.

22:40.333 --> 22:42.666
So I told the sales lady,
"I'll take one in each color."

22:42.666 --> 22:45.625
And she said, "Are you getting a divorce?"
And I said, "How'd you guess?"

22:48.208 --> 22:49.375
That's really funny, Mom.

22:49.375 --> 22:52.666
Hey, can you let me bring over some people
on Saturday?

22:52.666 --> 22:53.875
Oh sure. Like a playdate?

22:53.875 --> 22:57.833
A playdate? Mom, I'm 13.
Please don't call it a playdate.

22:58.750 --> 23:00.875
My dad's calling me. Hi!

23:00.875 --> 23:03.375
<i>Hey! Stacels.
Hey, I'm at the store right now.</i>

23:03.375 --> 23:05.750
<i>Mommy told me you need some, uh, tampons...</i>

23:05.750 --> 23:08.083
<i>- But I'm not sure what size you use--</i>
- Stop. Get whatever.

23:08.083 --> 23:09.958
<i>There's a lot of whatever
to choose from.</i>

23:09.958 --> 23:11.333
Do pads. I don't care.

23:11.333 --> 23:12.875
<i>What kind of flow do you got going?</i>

23:12.875 --> 23:14.666
<i>- Uh, heavy flow situation?</i>
- Heavy.

23:14.666 --> 23:16.708
- Oh my God.
<i>- A light flow? Or extra chunky?</i>

23:16.708 --> 23:19.500
<i>I... I... I got confused.
I'm getting peanut butter also.</i>

23:19.500 --> 23:22.666
-  I mean--
<i>- Mommy said it was a high-alert situation?</i>

23:22.666 --> 23:24.458
<i>That you might have to sleep
in the bathtub?</i>

23:24.458 --> 23:26.291
<i>I'll drop 'em off
in your room immediately.</i>

23:26.291 --> 23:27.791
Oh my God. Love you. Bye.

23:31.583 --> 23:34.541
"Hey, Lyd, it's Kym.
Having people over now."

23:34.541 --> 23:36.000
"Pull up if you're free."

23:36.500 --> 23:37.333
Wow.

23:39.250 --> 23:40.916
Um, what do I say?

23:40.916 --> 23:42.250
Do you want to go?

23:44.125 --> 23:45.000
No.

23:46.750 --> 23:49.416
But, I mean, I should respond.

23:49.416 --> 23:52.500
Yeah. For sure.
Uh, if you want to go, I don't care.

23:52.500 --> 23:55.416
I just think they're awful,
but it's your choice.

23:56.583 --> 23:58.750
- Let me ask if you can come.
- No. Please don't do that.

23:58.750 --> 24:02.291
Yeah, I'm gonna ask. Doing it right now.
Look, I just did it. Whoops. Sorry.

24:09.125 --> 24:13.083
Oh my God! Okay, Mom, can you drop us off
at Kym Chang-Cohen's house, please?

24:13.083 --> 24:15.708
- Wait. Can you stop by my place first?
-  Sure.

24:15.708 --> 24:18.666
-  Period.
- You gonna ask if Tara and Nikki can come?

24:18.666 --> 24:19.750
Oh.

24:20.250 --> 24:23.458
Oh. Um, I mean, I don't think so.

24:23.458 --> 24:25.375
Bringing three people
would be, like, a lot.

24:25.375 --> 24:26.833
- Yeah, I agree.
- Yeah.

24:29.791 --> 24:32.583
- You can't go now.

24:36.833 --> 24:38.500
Okay. Hurry.

24:38.500 --> 24:39.708
- Hi, Ron.
-  Hi.

24:39.708 --> 24:42.166
- Should I wear a jacket with this?
- No. Where are you going?

24:42.166 --> 24:43.583
Kym Chang-Cohen's.

24:43.583 --> 24:46.708
Oh wow. First rule of going
to a cool kid's house, don't disagree.

24:46.708 --> 24:47.666
Don't get too excited.

24:47.666 --> 24:48.750
- Got it. Thanks.
- Cool.

24:48.750 --> 24:50.375
Oh, Dad left pads on your bed.

24:50.375 --> 24:52.875
They're enormous.
I almost thought they were pillows.

24:52.875 --> 24:53.875
Are you joking?

24:53.875 --> 24:55.750
That's funny.

25:02.791 --> 25:04.291
Oh my God.

25:04.291 --> 25:06.750
Remember.
Don't disagree. Don't get too excited.

25:17.250 --> 25:19.416
So, Lydia, any crushes?

25:20.708 --> 25:22.291
Oh, uh...

25:23.041 --> 25:26.583
No, not really. There's not a lot
of options for boys in our grade.

25:26.583 --> 25:28.375
- You know?

25:29.416 --> 25:31.333
Oh, so you only like boys?

25:31.333 --> 25:33.541
Uh, I think so.

25:33.541 --> 25:35.458
Don't worry. Some of us are straight too.

25:35.458 --> 25:36.541
Cool.

25:37.333 --> 25:38.666
I don't disagree.

25:43.166 --> 25:44.666
Yeah, Stacy, what about you?

25:45.333 --> 25:46.291
Who do you like?

25:47.625 --> 25:49.750
Uh, no one, really.

25:53.500 --> 25:57.500
Uh, people are coming to my house tomorrow
if you want to come. Nothing big.

25:57.500 --> 25:58.625
Sounds chill.

25:59.208 --> 26:01.291
You guys have to come.
It'll be freaking amazing!

26:01.291 --> 26:02.750
Her house is so cool.

26:06.250 --> 26:07.791
I mean, it'll be a'ight.

26:07.791 --> 26:11.708
Uh, anyways, we should
probably wash this off before we go.

26:11.708 --> 26:14.708
- Uh, we have to change before we leave.
- Where are we going?

26:14.708 --> 26:16.208
To the ledge.

26:22.416 --> 26:24.250
- No way.
- We'll be careful.

26:24.250 --> 26:25.458
I don't want to die.

26:25.458 --> 26:27.250
- We have to. We can't disagree.
- What?

26:27.250 --> 26:28.333
Don't act excited!

26:28.333 --> 26:29.833
Andy will be there.

26:33.916 --> 26:35.666
Come on, Lydia, can't you do this for me?

26:35.666 --> 26:37.833
I already got you invited here.
Isn't that enough?

26:40.416 --> 26:41.791
I didn't mean it like that.

26:41.791 --> 26:43.333
You guys coming or what?

26:43.333 --> 26:44.583
Yeah, I'm down.

26:58.250 --> 27:00.000
<i>♪ It's irresistible ♪</i>

27:00.000 --> 27:02.375

before I can get lip filler.

27:06.375 --> 27:08.750
She said you can have Botox.
Just use that on your lips.

27:08.750 --> 27:09.666
Yeah.

27:11.375 --> 27:13.375

What's good?

27:45.750 --> 27:46.583
Hi, Stacy.

27:47.375 --> 27:48.208
Hey, Mateo.

27:48.208 --> 27:51.541
Yo, we just had soccer,
and we kicked St. Catherine's ass, 3-0.

27:51.541 --> 27:52.958
Even though their field sucks.

27:52.958 --> 27:55.291
Yeah, that field is so lopsided.

27:57.041 --> 27:58.000
Exactly.

27:58.791 --> 27:59.625
Uh,

28:00.250 --> 28:01.250
how's your head?

28:06.208 --> 28:08.875
It's, um... it's still on her body, so...

28:09.458 --> 28:10.625
Yeah, we love that.

28:10.625 --> 28:13.166
And I'm not barfing, so, yeah.

28:15.833 --> 28:17.916
Uh, anyways...

28:18.833 --> 28:20.250
What's up? I'm Andy.

28:20.250 --> 28:23.291
Uh, I know. We, uh...
we go to Hebrew school together. Lydia.

28:23.291 --> 28:24.583
We do?

28:24.583 --> 28:25.875
Yeah.

28:27.333 --> 28:29.500
I dare one of you guys to jump in!

28:29.500 --> 28:30.958
Come on! Let's go.

28:30.958 --> 28:32.250
Jump off the ledge, Aaron?

28:32.250 --> 28:34.916
You'd break both legs on impact
and your spine.

28:34.916 --> 28:36.833
Yeah, I heard
Melissa Quinto's cousin jumped,

28:36.833 --> 28:39.291
and she now has to text
with her nose, so, no.

28:39.291 --> 28:41.166
Looks like it might be fun.

28:42.708 --> 28:44.625
Hey, I'd jump
if I didn't have my contacts in.

28:44.625 --> 28:47.125
Oh, I'd be happy
to hold them for you, Aaron.

28:50.666 --> 28:53.708
Oh shit. You can't see.

28:56.416 --> 28:57.250
I'll do it.

28:58.583 --> 28:59.416
What?

29:00.541 --> 29:01.625
You'd jump in?

29:01.625 --> 29:03.916
That... that's sick.

29:03.916 --> 29:05.083
Let's see it.

29:07.416 --> 29:08.333
Okay.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.791
- No way, no way.
- Oh shit.

29:10.791 --> 29:12.708
If she jumps, it's my idea, guys.

29:12.708 --> 29:14.750
We don't know if that's shallow.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.375
- She's not gonna do it.
- She's not gonna do it.

29:34.375 --> 29:36.708
- If she dies, we weren't here.
- Hell no.

29:36.708 --> 29:39.000
-  She's a scaredy-cat.
-  She's stalling.

29:39.541 --> 29:42.791
Stacy, you said we'd be careful. Please.

29:43.291 --> 29:44.208
Is Andy watching?

29:47.500 --> 29:49.125
Everyone is watching!

29:50.541 --> 29:53.666
Friedman! Yo, you got this! Let's go!

29:54.583 --> 29:56.625
-  Let's get it!
- Stacy, do not do this to me.

29:56.625 --> 30:00.250
If you die, your parents will kill me.
I swear to God. Stacy! No!

30:09.625 --> 30:12.125
- Oh my God!
- Holy shit!

30:12.125 --> 30:13.791
- My God!
- Oh my God!

30:18.000 --> 30:19.208
Stacy!

30:19.875 --> 30:21.166
- Stacy!
- Oh shit!

30:22.041 --> 30:23.708
That was unreal!

30:26.000 --> 30:27.958
-  Stacy!
- Woohoo!

30:29.041 --> 30:30.666
- That was my idea!
- Yo, shut up!

30:30.666 --> 30:33.250
Yo, Stacy Friedman!

30:33.250 --> 30:35.541
You're a fricken' legend!

30:35.541 --> 30:37.500
That's how I do it!

30:40.125 --> 30:41.833
What is that?

30:47.708 --> 30:50.041
Oh, disgusting.

30:50.041 --> 30:53.583
Yo, Stacy just turned the ledge
into the Red Sea.

30:58.833 --> 30:59.791
Chill out.

30:59.791 --> 31:01.833
It's just a period, guys.
It happens every month.

31:01.833 --> 31:03.291
That looks like two months.

31:03.291 --> 31:05.333
You couldn't deal
with having a period, Aaron.

31:05.333 --> 31:06.416
Yeah, you punk.

31:06.416 --> 31:07.958
Wait, what'd I even do?

31:20.500 --> 31:22.208
Thanks for laughing with everyone.

31:23.375 --> 31:24.708
I wasn't laughing.

31:24.708 --> 31:26.083
Yes, you were.

31:26.083 --> 31:28.916
Stacy, it's not that big of a deal.
Just take my sweatshirt.

31:28.916 --> 31:31.833
Not a big deal? That was humiliating!
Andy looked at me like--

31:31.833 --> 31:34.208
You're a badass!
That's all anyone was thinking.

31:34.208 --> 31:36.625
No, whatever. I'm over him.

31:38.458 --> 31:39.625
Call it.

31:39.625 --> 31:42.250
- Stacy, think this through.
- I did. Call it.

31:46.083 --> 31:47.166
5:23.

31:47.166 --> 31:50.750
Stacy Friedman's crush
on Andy Goldfarb has ended.

31:50.750 --> 31:54.041
Time of death, 5:23 p.m.

31:54.041 --> 31:55.791
Okay, let's just go.

31:55.791 --> 31:57.750
No, you just stay with your new friends.

31:57.750 --> 31:59.375
What? What are you talking about?

31:59.375 --> 32:01.708
Oh my God, stop! You didn't have my back.
Just admit it!

32:01.708 --> 32:04.333
You stop. I told you not to jump.
I didn't even want to be here.

32:04.333 --> 32:06.708
Only because you already got them
to come to your party!

32:06.708 --> 32:10.125
- You're being so dramatic right now!
- You're such a wannabe right now!

32:11.750 --> 32:13.333
I'm freezing. I'm gonna go.

32:13.333 --> 32:16.083
Wow, Stacy. I can't even.

32:16.083 --> 32:17.583
I can't even, even more.

32:21.500 --> 32:22.708
What you gonna do, sweets?

32:22.708 --> 32:24.416
Sending out the invitations today.

32:24.416 --> 32:27.125
I have to get my hair dyed--
Oh, will you call DJ Schmuley?

32:27.125 --> 32:29.875
He's asking for a green room and per diem.

32:29.875 --> 32:31.791
And he may or may not have hit on me.

32:31.791 --> 32:33.708
Well, I may or may not punch him
in the face.

32:33.708 --> 32:35.708
- Yeah, okay.
- Let me handle Schmuley.

32:35.708 --> 32:37.916
So, you, I'm going to the movies.
You want to come?

32:38.625 --> 32:41.166
Too weird being
at a movie theater alone with my dad.

32:41.166 --> 32:44.125
Okay, you never want to be with me again?
What are you gonna do all day?

32:44.125 --> 32:48.041
Zaara's coming over, and we're going to
online shop and then take a nap outside.

32:48.791 --> 32:50.000
And that's not weird to you?

32:50.000 --> 32:52.500
We're tired from frickin' school all week!

32:53.666 --> 32:57.375
Honey, go have quality time with
your younger daughter who still loves you.

32:57.375 --> 32:58.833
-  Yeah.
- Okay? Have a good day.

32:58.833 --> 33:00.791
This one scares me.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.416
- Miss you already, Daddy!
-  Do ya? Great.

33:15.583 --> 33:17.541
<i>Oh my God!</i>

33:37.666 --> 33:40.250
- We ready in there, buddy?
-  One second, Dad!

33:57.333 --> 33:59.875
Don't do this to me. Let's go!

33:59.875 --> 34:01.041
Coming!

34:04.625 --> 34:05.708
<i>Bubie</i>, I'm psyched.

34:05.708 --> 34:08.666
I'm psyched about the popcorn.
Lots of butter.

34:09.458 --> 34:11.416
Lots of anger after I finish it.

34:11.416 --> 34:14.583
- Lots of oil on my face.
- Dad, can I skip the movies?

34:14.583 --> 34:17.666
You wanna skip the movie? How come?
You don't want to be seen with me either?

34:17.666 --> 34:21.041
No, no, no. I just need to talk to Lydia.
Can you drop me at her house?

34:22.041 --> 34:23.125
Sure, buddy.

34:24.250 --> 34:26.333
What's the matter? Something bugging you?

34:27.375 --> 34:29.166
It'll be fine. Whatever it is.

34:31.458 --> 34:33.791
Here. Don't tell your mother.

38:17.083 --> 38:19.791
Yeah. Everybody keeps asking us
if you need a double-X tampon.

38:19.791 --> 38:21.958

-  Are you sure, Stace?

38:21.958 --> 38:24.583

Her party this weekend.

39:00.500 --> 39:01.750
She had the party?

39:01.750 --> 39:03.583
Guess so. She didn't invite us.

39:03.583 --> 39:06.083
No surprise, because they were
awfully chummy laughing

39:06.083 --> 39:08.416
at my near-death experience at the ledge.

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
You guys went to the ledge with Andy?

39:12.958 --> 39:15.208
Oh, it's just the ledge.
It was last minute.

39:15.708 --> 39:16.666
Hmm.

39:17.916 --> 39:19.750
- Come on, Tara. Let's go.
- Yeah.

39:22.583 --> 39:25.416
Okay, today we're going
to be talking about <i>tikkun olam</i>.

39:25.416 --> 39:26.791

39:27.458 --> 39:28.375
Kym!

39:28.375 --> 39:30.958
If God exists,
then how do you explain climate change?

39:33.333 --> 39:35.791
It's actually an amazing question. Um--

39:35.791 --> 39:38.750
Yeah, and why can't straight people
get on gay TikTok? It's way funnier.

39:38.750 --> 39:42.125
And if God loves me, then why
is he always giving me so many zits.

39:42.125 --> 39:44.000
And why does Apple
keep changing their chargers?

39:44.000 --> 39:46.333
And why did my dad's doctor operate
on the wrong shoulder?

39:46.333 --> 39:48.666

with my grandma?

39:50.333 --> 39:51.958
Okay, okay, okay.

39:51.958 --> 39:56.458

about being on your phone?

41:18.208 --> 41:21.083
Right? Aaron knows what I'm talking about.
Come on, dude.

41:22.583 --> 41:24.833

-  Yes, sir.

41:31.458 --> 41:34.125

41:34.125 --> 41:36.916
You used to be such a good,

41:36.916 --> 41:39.791
Now, you're on your phone.
You're not practicing your portion.

41:39.791 --> 41:42.333
Talk to me, sis.
What's crappenin'?

41:43.583 --> 41:47.375
Do you know what your portion is about?
Do you understand <i>Ki Tisa</i>?

41:47.875 --> 41:50.750
Yeah. Lots of golden calf talk
and stuff like that.

41:51.875 --> 41:55.916
Yeah, but it's also about becoming
your own individual person.

41:55.916 --> 41:58.291
It's about taking responsibilities
for your mistakes.

41:58.291 --> 41:59.625

42:00.291 --> 42:01.916

42:01.916 --> 42:04.666
You haven't started
your mitzvah project yet either, huh?

42:05.625 --> 42:07.166
I'm narrowing it down.

42:07.166 --> 42:10.541
<i>Seema</i>, I'm telling you,
the sooner you do your mitzvah,

42:10.541 --> 42:13.083
which is a good deed,
a commandment by the way,

42:13.083 --> 42:15.583
the sooner you'll find
things falling into place.

42:17.458 --> 42:19.625
Wait, so, if I do a mitzvah,
God will reward me?

42:19.625 --> 42:22.583
-  No, not reward--
- And he'll give me what I want?

42:22.583 --> 42:24.208
Well, I definitely did not say that.

42:24.208 --> 42:26.875
No, thank you, Rabbi. You helped me
so much. I gotta get to work.

42:26.875 --> 42:28.000
Wait. No, no, no!

42:28.000 --> 42:30.083
Gotta start my journey, Rabbi Rebecca!

42:30.083 --> 42:31.208
Can you get me a Gatorade?

42:48.333 --> 42:50.458
Hey, uh, can I sit here?
-  Sure.

43:11.541 --> 43:12.458
Hey.

43:14.000 --> 43:16.125
You wouldn't happen
to know why people keep asking me

43:16.125 --> 43:18.500
if they can floss their teeth
with my nipple hair today,

43:18.500 --> 43:19.833
do you, Stacy?

43:19.833 --> 43:21.625
Uh, no.

43:21.625 --> 43:24.875
You know, seventh grade is hard enough
without people pointing and laughing at me

43:24.875 --> 43:28.250
whenever I walk down the hall,
screaming out, "Here, comes spider-nips."

43:28.250 --> 43:30.958
Better than, "Here comes Aunt Flow
and the Blood-Pads!"

43:30.958 --> 43:32.291
But that really happened, Stacy.

43:32.291 --> 43:35.250
- How do I know your nipples are hairless?
- Because you do!

43:37.291 --> 43:40.500
Why are you dating him?
I thought it was just one kiss?

43:41.000 --> 43:43.666
And stop doing Rabbi Rebecca impressions
to Andy.

43:43.666 --> 43:45.958

I need to get on that ASAP.

Oh, chicken parmesan!

44:07.416 --> 44:08.416
Correct.

44:08.416 --> 44:11.291
Honey, why don't you and Lydia
do something with the homeless

44:11.291 --> 44:13.458
or volunteer at the animal shelter?

44:13.458 --> 44:16.041
Cause it’s my Bat Mitzvah
and I’m not doing my project with Lydia.

44:16.041 --> 44:17.208
It's a statement about me.

44:17.208 --> 44:19.375
Stace, that's what you said
about the egg roll piñata.

44:19.375 --> 44:21.041
- And the dress.
- And your hair.

44:21.041 --> 44:23.125
Shut up, Zaara. Why are you always here?

44:23.125 --> 44:24.375

48:23.500 --> 48:27.666
We just celebrated with our families,
and poof, you're a woman.

48:27.666 --> 48:29.666
- Yeah.
- Girls didn't have Bat Mitzvahs?

48:29.666 --> 48:33.833
My mother told me girls were born
into God's kingdom, so we didn't have to.

48:34.541 --> 48:37.250
She was full of it.
She was just trying to save money.

48:43.458 --> 48:44.458
Go. Just go.

48:45.916 --> 48:48.958
Man, that's all-time.
You ever seen <i>Evil Dead 2</i>?

48:48.958 --> 48:51.541
- Yeah, we saw it. It was weak.
<i>-</i> Yeah, just like you two.

48:51.541 --> 48:53.875
Ugh. Could you
just let us watch our movie?

48:54.625 --> 48:55.666
Okay.

48:55.666 --> 48:58.333
<i>♪ I've been running with the wolves
To get to you ♪</i>

49:13.000 --> 49:14.083
What's going on?

49:14.083 --> 49:16.041
Why are you hanging out
with us old people right now?

49:16.041 --> 49:19.083
- Why are you not with your friends?
- I have a stomach ache.

49:19.083 --> 49:22.375
You have a stomach ache?
All right. I'll get you a ginger ale.

49:23.041 --> 49:25.666
You're not hot. You feel fine.

49:27.125 --> 49:28.833
You don't have a stomach ache.

49:30.458 --> 49:33.041
How come you're not hanging out
with Lydia tonight?

49:33.041 --> 49:34.083
She betrayed me.

49:34.083 --> 49:37.416
She kissed my crush,
and then he touched her underboob in PE.

49:37.416 --> 49:39.416
- Oh.
- Oy, underboob.

49:39.416 --> 49:41.708
Oh, I got plenty of that.

49:41.708 --> 49:45.208
Underboob, overboob,
sideboob, behindboob, I got all of it.

49:45.208 --> 49:46.500
Oh.

49:46.500 --> 49:48.708
You know, <i>bubelah</i>, when I was young,

49:48.708 --> 49:52.375
my best friend Susie Rebenstock
and I fought over a boy,

49:52.375 --> 49:54.125
and I stopped talking to her.

49:54.125 --> 49:57.208
Fifty years later,
I ran into her brother at Zabar's.

49:57.208 --> 50:00.083
Turns out,
she threw herself off a roof at 32.

50:00.083 --> 50:03.041
I let a stupid boy come between us,

50:03.041 --> 50:05.833
and now she's lying dead
at the bottom of the Chrysler Building.

50:05.833 --> 50:07.250
Oh my God.

50:07.250 --> 50:10.166
- It was McDonald's.
- Whatever! You get my point.

50:10.666 --> 50:13.375
All I'm saying is we girls
have to stick together!

50:13.375 --> 50:14.625
- Yeah.
- Hear, hear.

50:23.708 --> 50:24.666
Megan!

50:26.375 --> 50:28.958
Okay. Here, <i>Tatala</i>, huh?

50:28.958 --> 50:30.500
- Thank you.
- Okay.

50:30.500 --> 50:31.791
- Hiya, ladies.
- Hello.

50:31.791 --> 50:33.458
-  Hey, hey.
- And gentleman.

50:34.750 --> 50:36.208
Mind if I take your extra rolls?

50:36.208 --> 50:38.583
I'm making up a plate
for Andy Goldfarb's grandmother.

50:38.583 --> 50:39.958
Oh, that's nice.

50:39.958 --> 50:42.041
- What a respectful boy you are.
- That's sweet.

50:42.041 --> 50:43.666
- Here's some basketball rolls.
-<i>Gracias.</i>

50:43.666 --> 50:46.125
Wait, why are you making a plate
for Andy's grandma?

50:46.125 --> 50:48.291
She only gets Jell-O
at her retirement home.

50:48.291 --> 50:52.333
I thought that I'd get real food for Andy
to bring to her when he visits tomorrow.

50:52.333 --> 50:54.541
Wait, Andy's grandma's
in a retirement home?

50:55.500 --> 50:56.583
That's awesome.

50:57.291 --> 50:58.833
Wait, why is that awesome?

51:21.375 --> 51:22.875
Ooh! The bookies are here!

51:32.416 --> 51:35.041
Andy? Oh, hey!

51:35.916 --> 51:36.750
Yo.

51:38.833 --> 51:40.375
What are you doing here?

51:40.375 --> 51:42.333
I'm just visiting my grandma.

51:42.333 --> 51:46.333
She's taking a nap right now,
so I got to sit here till I get picked up.

51:46.333 --> 51:48.541
It's so sweet that you visit her.

51:48.541 --> 51:51.833
Yeah, my moms say
they'll take away my Xbox if I don't. So...

51:53.458 --> 51:54.541
So...

51:55.875 --> 51:57.750
Are you excited about your Bar Mitzvah?

51:57.750 --> 51:59.291
Yeah, it should be all right.

51:59.291 --> 52:00.791
That's dope.

52:03.750 --> 52:06.916
Yeah, but Lydia, she's being all salty

52:06.916 --> 52:09.833
'cause she has to miss
some dumb dance competition to go.

52:09.833 --> 52:11.416
Ugh. I hate how competitive she is.

52:11.416 --> 52:14.083
It's just like,
why can't it be about the dancing?

52:14.083 --> 52:17.666
Well, I mean, I play soccer,
and soccer is pretty competitive.

52:17.666 --> 52:21.541
Uh, well, soccer's a sport.
Dance is an art.

52:23.000 --> 52:24.208
Facts.

52:24.791 --> 52:25.875
Real talk.

52:26.500 --> 52:28.125
<i>Andy Goldfarb.</i>

52:28.125 --> 52:30.500
Um, yeah. Uber's here. Gotta bounce.

52:30.500 --> 52:32.541
Okay. So nice running into you.

52:32.541 --> 52:33.833
Yeah, cool.

52:36.958 --> 52:38.500
- Hey.
- Yo!

52:39.541 --> 52:41.500
-  Too slow, boy!
- Jesus.

52:41.500 --> 52:45.416
Can't guard me.
Ha ha, old man! Goldfarb rules!

52:46.875 --> 52:49.125
Still waitin' on me bookies!

52:49.125 --> 52:50.375
It's right here.

52:52.250 --> 52:53.583
I don't want that one.

53:00.583 --> 53:04.416
Hello, Joe. Can you refill
my popcorn please? Extra butter.

53:05.041 --> 53:06.041
On it.

53:08.833 --> 53:10.208
<i>I love this Carnivale theme,</i>

53:10.208 --> 53:12.958
<i>but your Candyland theme
is going to be the best of the year.</i>

53:12.958 --> 53:15.875
<i>Well, until your New York
theme puts the entire school to shame!</i>

53:15.875 --> 53:16.958
<i>Yeah.</i>

53:16.958 --> 53:19.083
<i>Why'd we eat
so many Twizzlers last night?</i>

53:19.083 --> 53:20.416
<i>I don't know!</i>

53:20.416 --> 53:21.500
Hey, Stacy.

53:22.000 --> 53:23.291
Oh, hey, Mateo.

53:23.291 --> 53:26.250
Hey, can you believe no Bar
or Bat Mitzvah tonight?

53:26.250 --> 53:27.541
Get to go to the movies.

53:27.541 --> 53:29.416
What are you seeing?

53:29.416 --> 53:31.583
I'm not sure. Andy bought the tickets.

53:31.583 --> 53:33.625
- Andy's here?
-  Yeah.

53:36.416 --> 53:39.208
- Sorry, the butter nozzle's jammed.
- No, it's fine. I don't need butter.

53:39.208 --> 53:41.541
- All good. I know you love butter.
- No, I really don't need butter.

53:41.541 --> 53:43.583
I'll grab a coat hanger.
This is all fixed.

53:43.583 --> 53:45.375
- Dude, give me the popcorn!
-  Stacy Friedman.

53:45.375 --> 53:47.541
Hey, Kym! What's up?

53:48.250 --> 53:51.208
Hey, yo, what's poppin'?
How's the bookie business?

53:51.208 --> 53:53.000
Booming. Still got your Xbox?

53:53.583 --> 53:54.416
You know it.

53:54.416 --> 53:55.791
That's what's up.

53:56.958 --> 53:59.000
<i>Bubie</i>, what's taking you so long?

53:59.000 --> 54:01.291
Is the guy mad at us
for getting three refills?

54:01.291 --> 54:02.625
Where is that dude?

54:02.625 --> 54:03.916
Oh, your friends are here.

54:03.916 --> 54:06.500
What's up, everybody?
Nice to see you guys.

54:06.500 --> 54:09.958
- I like your robe, man!
- Oh yeah, the kid likes the drip.

54:09.958 --> 54:11.125
I like your taste.

54:11.125 --> 54:13.166
So I'm gonna go outside and get a blanket

54:13.166 --> 54:15.500
from the trunk of the car
'cause it's freezing in there.

54:15.500 --> 54:18.541
We can kind of snuggle
like we used to. All right?

54:18.541 --> 54:21.833
Always fun, right? Blanket time?
You know what I'm talking about, bro?

54:22.750 --> 54:24.416
- Wha--
- I see you back there, Lydia.

54:24.416 --> 54:26.583
- How you doing, kiddo?
- Oh, hey.

54:26.583 --> 54:29.500
- Love ya. Say hi to your folks.
- Yeah, of course.

54:29.500 --> 54:31.125
-  Miss you, buddy.
-  See you.

54:32.791 --> 54:33.916
You-- Oh...

54:44.958 --> 54:46.750
Stacy! We're here.

54:49.083 --> 54:50.291
Did you fall off a motorcycle?

54:50.291 --> 54:53.416
- Did you eat nuts? Do you need an EpiPen?
- Why do you look like a bad IG filter?

54:53.416 --> 54:55.208
Can periods happen to your face?

54:55.208 --> 54:56.500
Shut up. Come in.

54:57.041 --> 54:59.708
-  What are you wearing? Oh my God.
-  Scandy!

54:59.708 --> 55:00.666
Guys...

55:06.208 --> 55:08.791
Tara, you're putting the lighting
in the camera. Okay, yeah.

55:08.791 --> 55:11.583
- Lift it higher. Make sure I'm glowing.
-  I'm not built for this.

55:11.583 --> 55:14.500
You know, I really thought we were
just gonna hang out and make slime.

55:14.500 --> 55:15.916
Oh my God, we're women now.

55:17.041 --> 55:17.875
Maybe later.

55:18.458 --> 55:19.375
How does this look?

55:20.833 --> 55:22.125
Like your goldfish died.

55:22.125 --> 55:23.166
Hey, just switch it up.

55:23.750 --> 55:25.041
-  Okay.
- There you go.

55:26.083 --> 55:27.958
Seduce me. Okay? Just seduce me.

55:27.958 --> 55:30.500
Oh, way better. Slay, queen.

55:30.500 --> 55:32.750
Guys, this is so lame.

55:32.750 --> 55:35.416
I thought we could be, like,
this iconic best friend trio, you know?

55:35.416 --> 55:37.333
Now that Lydia broke up with you and all.

55:38.333 --> 55:42.041
Uh-oh. Now you look like all the goldfish
in the world just died.

55:42.041 --> 55:45.583
No, it's fine. Let's just take
more pictures and then change outfits.

55:45.583 --> 55:47.958
-  There's more outfits?
- That's-- Okay. Yeah.

55:50.125 --> 55:51.875
-  Are you serious?
-  Geez, Stace.

55:51.875 --> 55:54.041
Whoa, what is happening?

55:54.583 --> 55:56.166
Uh, taking pictures.

55:56.166 --> 55:57.666
You look insane.

55:57.666 --> 55:59.958
Uh, we're gonna go get some boba
and then watch a movie,

55:59.958 --> 56:01.333
<i>Evil Dead 2</i>, if you wanna come.

56:01.333 --> 56:02.833
- Yeah, just--
- Oh, thank God.

56:02.833 --> 56:03.875
Yes!

56:03.875 --> 56:05.833
What happened to your armpits?

56:05.833 --> 56:08.250
Oh, I shaved this morning.
It did not go well.

56:08.833 --> 56:10.958
It's fine! I didn't need you anyway.

56:19.041 --> 56:20.625
Don't you love puzzles?

56:21.958 --> 56:23.125
Puzzles are corny.

56:23.625 --> 56:24.958
Facts.

56:32.666 --> 56:35.875
I have a question. Is Lydia a good kisser?

56:37.333 --> 56:38.208
She's a'ight.

56:39.208 --> 56:40.666
A'ight? Huh.

56:41.375 --> 56:43.500
Probably because you were her first kiss.

56:43.500 --> 56:46.708
No, she's told me she's kissed a bunch
of guys before.

56:47.416 --> 56:48.416
At camp?

56:49.333 --> 56:50.250
Yes.

56:50.250 --> 56:54.333
Does her tight-lipped technique
suggest a high level of experience?

56:54.333 --> 56:57.791
Nah, it's like she thinks she's kissing
a stuffed animal or something.

56:57.791 --> 57:00.416
Plus, every time I try to move my hand,
she starts laughing,

57:00.416 --> 57:01.750
says she's mad ticklish.

57:01.750 --> 57:04.375
You have the patience
of a saint.

57:04.916 --> 57:06.125
A Jewish saint.

57:07.833 --> 57:08.708
True.

57:12.916 --> 57:14.333
Twenty points for me.

57:14.333 --> 57:15.666
Get it, Grandma.

57:15.666 --> 57:18.708
Want a picture of you and your grandma
to prove to your moms you're here?

57:19.375 --> 57:22.041
Uh, yeah. That's low-key a good idea.

57:24.041 --> 57:25.041
Okay.

57:31.625 --> 57:33.500
-  Yeah, Grandma.
- Hilarious.

57:34.250 --> 57:36.041
I have to prove
to Rabbi Rebecca I'm here too.

57:36.041 --> 57:38.125
I'm volunteering for my mitzvah project.

57:38.125 --> 57:40.125
- That's what's up.
- Here, I'll send it to you.

57:40.625 --> 57:43.291
- For sure.
- Oh, shoot. I just sent you more pics.

57:43.291 --> 57:45.208
- Just ignore.
-  <i>Andy Goldfarb.</i>

57:53.375 --> 57:54.666
Nice.

58:00.083 --> 58:02.791
-  That one's way too big on me.
- Okey-dokey.

58:04.541 --> 58:07.166
Well, why don't you try the strapless one?

58:08.958 --> 58:12.041
So, how's Lydia's entrance video
coming along?

58:13.416 --> 58:15.041
I finished it this weekend.

58:15.041 --> 58:15.958
Great!

58:16.666 --> 58:17.541
No.

58:17.541 --> 58:18.791
Why is it a no?

58:18.791 --> 58:20.458
Just-- it's just a no.

58:20.458 --> 58:22.625
Well, okay, then try the last one on.

58:22.625 --> 58:24.208
No, that's the worst one!

58:24.208 --> 58:25.500
Well, just try it!

58:25.500 --> 58:26.750
Oh my God.

58:26.750 --> 58:29.541
-  It's so ugly, Mom.

58:29.541 --> 58:31.583
Maybe it'll look good when it's on you.

58:33.875 --> 58:36.125
Oh.

58:37.458 --> 58:38.375
You know what?

58:39.666 --> 58:41.000
I like this.

58:41.000 --> 58:44.125
I look like the lady
at school that pulls kids out of class

58:44.125 --> 58:46.125
when their parents get into car accidents.

58:46.125 --> 58:47.750
How often does that happen?

58:48.875 --> 58:52.666
Can we please get this dress?
Come on. It's the dream dress.

58:52.666 --> 58:54.333
It costs more than our house.

58:54.333 --> 58:57.083
Okay, so wear the cheap dress
in front of God. Got it.

58:57.083 --> 58:58.416
It's not cheap.

58:58.416 --> 58:59.958
It's reasonable.

58:59.958 --> 59:03.166
That's what every kid wants to hear
on the most important day of their life.

59:03.166 --> 59:05.625
"Wow, Stacy, you look so <i>reasonable</i>."

59:05.625 --> 59:07.541
You know what? This is a nice,

59:08.541 --> 59:12.541
temple-friendly, well-priced dress. And--

59:12.541 --> 59:15.875
No. Don't say it. Please, Mom.
Please, I beg you.

59:16.375 --> 59:19.791
- We're gettin' it.
- Oh my God! You're ruining me!

59:20.958 --> 59:22.666
So ugly, Mom.

59:23.333 --> 59:26.791
- So, is this, like, a swipe or a chip?
-  Yeah, it's a chip.

59:26.791 --> 59:30.166
Good? Okay.
Wait, did I take it out too soon?

59:32.916 --> 59:35.375
Why? We could color coordinate.

59:35.375 --> 59:37.375
We're not color coordinating, Mom.
We're not doing that.

59:37.375 --> 59:39.000
- You want to ruin me?
- [Gabi Okay. No.

59:39.000 --> 59:41.416
It looks like something
the counselor at school wears, Mom.

59:41.416 --> 59:43.875
-  Okay, okay.
-  Please, I'm not wearing that.

59:44.708 --> 59:47.125
-  Yeah, I got that app too.
- Eli!

59:47.125 --> 59:48.958
-  What?
-  What do you think?

59:48.958 --> 59:51.208
What? Uh, Rudy, hold on a second.

59:51.708 --> 59:54.041
I'm at a family function or something, uh...

59:54.916 --> 59:58.958
Yeah, that dress is gorgeous, kiddo.
Only the best.

59:58.958 --> 01:00:01.500
<i>Papi,</i> you don't even know
which one we're talking about.

01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:04.416
It's the prettiest one.
Just like you, pumpkin.

01:00:05.166 --> 01:00:07.541
Twenty-three skidoo! Wee!

01:00:07.541 --> 01:00:10.333
Okay, yeah,
I think you gave me a good price.

01:00:11.250 --> 01:00:13.708
Mom? Mom, can we go?

01:00:13.708 --> 01:00:15.833
Yeah, okay. Take the dress.

01:00:15.833 --> 01:00:17.541
- Thank you.
- Okay.

01:00:17.541 --> 01:00:18.875
So great. We got a great deal.

01:00:18.875 --> 01:00:20.250
Where's Daddy? I don't remember--

01:00:20.250 --> 01:00:21.958
- No.
-  Gabi!

01:00:21.958 --> 01:00:22.875
Bree?!

01:00:22.875 --> 01:00:24.500
Lydia! Lydia's here--

01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:26.583
Oh my God! I haven't seen you in forever!

01:00:26.583 --> 01:00:27.833
Hi!

01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:31.291
Just like the two of us
to be getting dresses at the last minute.

01:00:31.291 --> 01:00:32.916
Why plan ahead, right?

01:00:34.041 --> 01:00:35.416
How are you? How's Stace?

01:00:35.416 --> 01:00:39.166
She's good. I miss Lydia.
She hasn't been over in a while.

01:00:39.166 --> 01:00:40.875
Eli! It's so great to see you.

01:00:40.875 --> 01:00:42.125
How you doing?

01:00:42.125 --> 01:00:44.375
Terrific. We're getting divorced.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.875
Oh yeah. I'm-- I heard. I'm so sorry.

01:00:47.875 --> 01:00:50.291
I'm not. I'm on six dating apps.

01:00:50.291 --> 01:00:52.250
Six? Wow, that's a lot.

01:00:52.250 --> 01:00:53.750
Andy broke up with me.

01:00:54.416 --> 01:00:57.208
Hmm. Sorry to hear that.
You were the perfect couple.

01:00:58.291 --> 01:01:02.166
He said he couldn't deal with the
ticklishness or the closed mouth kissing.

01:01:03.333 --> 01:01:04.875
Sucks for you, I guess.

01:01:06.083 --> 01:01:09.458
Said he heard
I lied about kissing boys in camp.

01:01:10.291 --> 01:01:13.333
Well, you did lie. So...

01:01:19.291 --> 01:01:20.291
See you at temple?

01:01:20.291 --> 01:01:21.875
- See you at temple.
- Okay.

01:01:21.875 --> 01:01:24.291
Anyhoo. Gonna go.

01:01:25.166 --> 01:01:26.583
-  Happy shopping!
-  Yeah!

01:01:26.583 --> 01:01:28.583
- Bye, Eli! Enjoy those dating apps.
- Yeah.

01:01:28.583 --> 01:01:30.625
- Bye, Stacy.
- See ya! Come on, honey.

01:01:32.125 --> 01:01:33.375
What's that mom's name again?

01:01:33.375 --> 01:01:35.083
Bree.

01:01:35.083 --> 01:01:36.375
Are you kidding me?

01:01:37.041 --> 01:01:39.666
You need to get your fat head
in the game, Eli.

01:01:39.666 --> 01:01:42.791
Stacy's father, Danny,
if you could remember names,

01:01:42.791 --> 01:01:47.083
who we've known since kindergarten,
is so involved in every single detail!

01:01:47.083 --> 01:01:48.791
Oh, he is?

01:01:48.791 --> 01:01:52.666
So, which detail is that?

01:01:54.416 --> 01:01:57.000
- He's exhausted from being a good dad.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.208
Honey. You wish.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.250
Can we get ice cream?

01:02:03.166 --> 01:02:05.708
- Did you guys already get ice cream?
- No, we didn't.

- Can I go to the bathroom?
-  <i>Yes you can.</i>

01:02:37.333 --> 01:02:41.000
<i>Go pee-pee, but quickly.</i>

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.250

Does anyone know the significance
of that particular piece of music, huh?

01:02:59.583 --> 01:03:02.416
Yes, Andy, please enlighten us.

01:03:03.375 --> 01:03:05.208
I gotta go to the bathroom too.

01:03:05.208 --> 01:03:07.833
No one thinks to take a whiz
before they come to class?

01:03:07.833 --> 01:03:09.750
Fine, Andy, but quickly!

01:03:09.750 --> 01:03:13.000
<i>- So quickly.

01:03:18.583 --> 01:03:20.250
<i>Good luck, Andy.</i>

01:03:20.250 --> 01:03:22.375
<i>Good luck, Andy.</i>

01:03:22.375 --> 01:03:27.583
<i>Hopefully, it's not number two!</i>

01:03:30.333 --> 01:03:32.625
It's Mr. Mateo!

01:03:34.166 --> 01:03:37.125
- Mr. Potatoes.
-  Mr. Potato.

01:03:37.125 --> 01:03:38.125
Hey, Stacy!

01:03:38.125 --> 01:03:41.666
Can't believe you're not even Jewish,
and you come to temple more than I do.

01:03:41.666 --> 01:03:44.375
Yeah, I go to church every Sunday.

01:03:44.375 --> 01:03:48.375
Might as well fill in the other six days
for some, you know, holiness too.

01:03:48.375 --> 01:03:51.000
I'm actually going
to help these guys make challah.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:54.458
-  Challah!
- Okay, okay! Challah, challah.

01:03:54.458 --> 01:03:56.291
- That's what I said!

01:03:56.291 --> 01:03:58.791
I'm waiting here for Mrs. Lippman
to unlock the kitchen.

01:03:58.791 --> 01:03:59.958
She's taking forever.

01:03:59.958 --> 01:04:03.791
I remember when I had Mrs. Lippman,
six years old, not a care in the world.

01:04:03.791 --> 01:04:04.708
I got cares.

01:04:04.708 --> 01:04:07.750
My mom says
if I don't learn the candle blessings,

01:04:07.750 --> 01:04:10.375
I can't play <i>Call of Duty</i> anymore!

01:04:10.375 --> 01:04:11.541
Oh, that's heavy.

01:04:11.541 --> 01:04:15.708
Or maybe Mr. Mateo will teach you.
He probably knows it by now.

01:04:15.708 --> 01:04:18.416
<i>Baruch Atah Adonai,</i>

01:04:18.416 --> 01:04:20.750
-<i>Eloheinu Melech ha'o--</i>

01:04:21.666 --> 01:04:23.541
- Mrs. Lippman!
-  Bye.

01:04:23.541 --> 01:04:24.750
See you later, Stacy.

01:04:29.291 --> 01:04:31.333
- Hi, Mike.
-  Shalom, Stacy.

01:04:45.041 --> 01:04:46.000
What's up?

01:04:47.208 --> 01:04:48.041
Hi.

01:04:48.583 --> 01:04:49.541
Hey, uh...

01:04:50.541 --> 01:04:52.500
Have you ever kissed anyone?

01:04:55.041 --> 01:04:56.833
Uh, no.

01:04:58.416 --> 01:04:59.750
Would you want to?

01:05:01.333 --> 01:05:02.208
Yeah.

01:05:03.458 --> 01:05:05.083
All right, come on, let's go.

01:05:07.750 --> 01:05:08.666
Come on.

01:05:14.458 --> 01:05:16.583
-  Um, someone's in here!
-  Go away!

01:05:17.541 --> 01:05:19.250
Where could we go?

01:05:20.708 --> 01:05:21.958
Come on. Let's go.

01:05:51.625 --> 01:05:53.666
No one's gonna find us in here.

01:05:54.958 --> 01:05:58.125
I don't know,
I just feel like God's gonna be mad.

01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:03.083
Nah, God's gonna be stoked
that we like each other so much.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:05.875
You're right.

01:06:14.125 --> 01:06:16.958
This is not the bathroom!

01:06:16.958 --> 01:06:18.000
Oh no.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:19.458
Do you see a toilet?!

01:06:19.458 --> 01:06:21.166
I didn't think so!

01:06:21.833 --> 01:06:23.041
I didn't need to go.

01:06:23.750 --> 01:06:25.958
Well, mazel tov, you guys are married now.

01:06:26.916 --> 01:06:28.541
Kidding, but you're in a lot of trouble.

01:06:29.250 --> 01:06:32.166
In front of the Torah?
What were you thinking?

01:06:32.166 --> 01:06:35.083
I said I was sorry.
Why is Andy not getting in trouble?

01:06:35.083 --> 01:06:36.166
Oh, he's in trouble!

01:06:36.166 --> 01:06:39.125
He's a repeat offender. We're handling it.

01:06:39.125 --> 01:06:40.583
I hope my father doesn't handle it.

01:06:40.583 --> 01:06:43.125
He'll put him in a wood chipper.
They'll never find his body.

01:06:44.541 --> 01:06:49.083
<i>Seema</i>, we're only a few weeks away
from your Bat Mitz. Okay, cutie-pops?

01:06:49.083 --> 01:06:51.625
This is supposed to be
the most important day of your life,

01:06:51.625 --> 01:06:54.416
and you're not taking it seriously at all.

01:06:54.416 --> 01:06:56.375
You haven't even done
your mitzvah project yet.

01:06:56.375 --> 01:06:59.125
I did my mitzvah project.
I volunteered at the retirement home.

01:06:59.125 --> 01:07:02.583
So you could do a mitzvah,
or so you could flirt with a boy?

01:07:03.458 --> 01:07:04.833
How did you know that?

01:07:04.833 --> 01:07:08.750
Let's just say there's
a wonderful woman there, Mrs. O'Leary,

01:07:08.750 --> 01:07:14.208
who wishes to convert to Judaism,
and you never brought her bookies!

01:07:14.916 --> 01:07:17.833
Yeah, you're not the only one
who's amazing at impressions.

01:07:18.333 --> 01:07:19.333
I'll do better.

01:07:20.166 --> 01:07:24.000
Let me take off
my "rabbi hat" for a second

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.416
and put on my "tough love hat."

01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:31.875
If you don't shape up, your Bat Mitzvah
is gonna be cancelled, sis.

01:07:32.875 --> 01:07:36.208
And that's the way
the <i>hamantaschen</i> crumbles. Capisce?

01:07:44.916 --> 01:07:47.375
Yes, we understand, Rabbi Rebecca.

01:07:47.375 --> 01:07:49.833
She doesn't really even deserve
a second chance.

01:07:49.833 --> 01:07:50.875
We thank you for that.

01:07:50.875 --> 01:07:52.041
Mm-hmm.

01:07:52.041 --> 01:07:56.125
Oh, and just please
calm your husband down.

01:07:56.125 --> 01:08:00.458
<i>Okay? Tell him don't put Andy Goldfarb
in a wood chipper.</i>

01:08:00.458 --> 01:08:03.125
-  She just walked in.
-  <i>Oh. Okay, good luck.</i>

01:08:05.333 --> 01:08:08.375
Dad, take a breath.
Just talk to her. Don't yell.

01:08:12.750 --> 01:08:14.125
He didn't take a breath.

01:08:14.125 --> 01:08:15.166
No.

01:08:19.666 --> 01:08:21.666
Hey. We don't slam doors in this house.

01:08:21.666 --> 01:08:24.250
- Dad, I need a break.
-  Well, welcome to being an adult.

01:08:24.250 --> 01:08:26.333
And welcome to being Jewish.
We don't get breaks.

01:08:26.333 --> 01:08:27.666
Oh my God! Stop!

01:08:27.666 --> 01:08:29.583
Kissing a boy in a temple?

01:08:29.583 --> 01:08:31.916
You know how disrespectful that is?

01:08:31.916 --> 01:08:37.166
Every time you walk into that synagogue,
you are declaring to everyone and God,

01:08:37.166 --> 01:08:39.916
"I'm Jewish, and I am part of this!"

01:08:39.916 --> 01:08:41.291
Well, maybe I don't want to be!

01:08:41.291 --> 01:08:42.458
Yes, you do!

01:08:42.458 --> 01:08:44.083
I was born into God's kingdom!

01:08:44.083 --> 01:08:47.125
Yeah? Well, God wants you out right now!
How's that?

01:08:47.125 --> 01:08:49.291
- I hate you!
-  You don't mean that.

01:08:49.291 --> 01:08:51.916
Wow, I never said that to him,
and I was nuts.

01:08:51.916 --> 01:08:53.583
-  You hate me?!

01:08:53.583 --> 01:08:56.375
I do. You're a jerk,
and you won't let me have a mojito bar.

01:08:56.375 --> 01:08:57.291
Gabi!

01:08:57.291 --> 01:08:58.208
Hi!

01:08:58.208 --> 01:09:00.333
That's why we fought the Nazis?

01:09:00.333 --> 01:09:02.041
So you could have a mojito bar?

01:09:02.041 --> 01:09:03.416
Is this a bad time?

01:09:03.416 --> 01:09:06.416
- Um, no. What's... what's going on?
-  Are you nuts?

01:09:06.416 --> 01:09:09.041
Well, Stacy was supposed
to do that video for Lydia's Bat Mitzvah.

01:09:09.041 --> 01:09:10.500
Oh, yeah, yeah. Of course, right.

01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:12.458
Get out of my room!
Stop ruining my life!

01:09:12.458 --> 01:09:14.541
- Anyways--
-  I paid for this room!

01:09:14.541 --> 01:09:15.500
She never sent it.

01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:18.500
I was in the neighborhood, and thought
I'd pop by and see if it was ready.

01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:19.666
-  Really?

01:09:19.666 --> 01:09:22.500
Oh, hi, Ronnie. Hi, Zaara. How's it going?

01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:24.791
Andy Goldfarb?
That's who you pick?

01:09:24.791 --> 01:09:26.791
Great! Nice to see you.

01:09:26.791 --> 01:09:28.833
You girls got so big. How's high school?

01:09:28.833 --> 01:09:30.958
You'll be the reason
I start doing drugs!

01:09:30.958 --> 01:09:32.166
Same here!

01:09:32.166 --> 01:09:33.083
Hard.

01:09:33.083 --> 01:09:34.541
Very, very stressful.

01:09:34.541 --> 01:09:35.583
Good God!

01:09:35.583 --> 01:09:39.291
Um, I think that Stacy said
she finished the video this weekend,

01:09:39.291 --> 01:09:41.500
so I can just email it to you ASAP.

01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:44.541
Thanks. Lydia keeps talking about how
she doesn't wanna have a video anymore.

01:09:44.541 --> 01:09:46.666
- I know she'd regret it.
-  You're on your own! Good luck!

01:09:46.666 --> 01:09:48.083
I hope you die before Mom!

01:09:48.083 --> 01:09:50.708
-  I'm taking you with me!
- We'll see you. Mazel tov! Bye!

01:10:07.750 --> 01:10:11.250
Andy Goldfarb
is going in the goddamn wood chipper!

01:10:11.250 --> 01:10:12.791
- Okay.

01:10:16.708 --> 01:10:18.250
<i>Dear God, Stacy here.</i>

01:10:19.666 --> 01:10:23.875
<i>So, as you probably already know,
Lydia's Bat Mitzvah is coming up,</i>

01:10:23.875 --> 01:10:26.041
<i>and I really don't know what to do.</i>

01:10:26.583 --> 01:10:28.791
<i>I'm not even sure if she wants me there.</i>

01:10:33.375 --> 01:10:35.666
<i>If I was in
this situation a month ago,</i>

01:10:35.666 --> 01:10:37.708
<i>I would've asked my friends what to do.</i>

01:10:38.583 --> 01:10:40.250
Hey, look, we're twinning.

01:10:41.583 --> 01:10:42.583
Twinning?

01:10:42.583 --> 01:10:44.375
What are we in fourth grade?

01:10:45.083 --> 01:10:47.083
<i>But the people
I'm hanging out with now,</i>

01:10:47.083 --> 01:10:49.375
<i>I don't know
if they'd have such good advice.</i>

01:10:49.375 --> 01:10:52.083
<i>et b'ney Moshe--</i>

01:10:52.083 --> 01:10:53.875
<i>I've actually been working hard</i>

01:10:53.875 --> 01:10:56.875
<i>because I want to have a good Bat Mitzvah
and a good life.</i>

01:10:57.375 --> 01:11:00.291

01:11:00.291 --> 01:11:02.791
<i>I don't know how to fix things with Lydia</i>,

01:11:02.791 --> 01:11:04.166
<i>or if I should,</i>

01:11:04.166 --> 01:11:05.916

Booyah!

01:11:12.291 --> 01:11:14.916
<i>So I've been focusing
on my new mitzvah project.</i>

I got you.

<i>...good things will start happening to me.</i>

01:11:29.666 --> 01:11:30.708
Thanks.

01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:34.083
<i>That's more of
a Buddhist concept than a Jewish one,</i>

01:11:34.083 --> 01:11:35.666
<i>but, hey, at this point, I'm--</i>

01:11:35.666 --> 01:11:36.791
Friedman?

01:11:37.625 --> 01:11:39.208
What the hell are you doing?

01:11:39.208 --> 01:11:41.000
Your meter was expired.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:42.958
Yes, I wanted it to be expired.

01:11:42.958 --> 01:11:44.916
The meter maid is a sexual icon,

01:11:44.916 --> 01:11:47.083
and I wanted a chance to hit on her.

01:11:47.083 --> 01:11:49.666
Now I have to wait 45 minutes!

01:11:49.666 --> 01:11:51.500
You're not supposed
to call them meter maids.

01:11:51.500 --> 01:11:53.291
And why are you in a handicapped spot?

01:11:53.875 --> 01:11:55.375
Everybody loves a bad boy.

01:11:56.166 --> 01:11:58.166
Gross. That's a $500 fine.

01:11:58.166 --> 01:11:59.333
Huh?

01:12:15.333 --> 01:12:16.291
What the heck, man?

01:12:16.958 --> 01:12:18.125
It was her fault!

01:12:18.833 --> 01:12:20.625
-  Her?
-  She did it!

01:12:20.625 --> 01:12:22.041
-  We know that kid.
- What?

01:12:22.041 --> 01:12:24.958
- She goes out with the basketball guy.
- Exactly.

01:12:37.833 --> 01:12:39.166
Stace?

01:12:40.708 --> 01:12:41.791
Honey?

01:12:43.333 --> 01:12:44.750
Why aren't you ready yet?

01:12:45.708 --> 01:12:47.333
I don't want to go.

01:12:47.333 --> 01:12:48.875
Yes, you do.

01:12:48.875 --> 01:12:51.333
This is Lydia's Bat Mitzvah.

01:12:52.250 --> 01:12:54.666
- She doesn't even want me there.
-  Honey.

01:12:54.666 --> 01:12:57.125
I don't know what's happening
between you two,

01:12:57.125 --> 01:13:00.250
but I know things must feel
really messed up right now.

01:13:00.250 --> 01:13:04.291
I know she hurt you,
but I'm sure she misses her best friend.

01:13:06.583 --> 01:13:08.541
You need to make things right.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:13.458
- Okay?
-  Yeah.

01:13:13.458 --> 01:13:15.916
Okay,
I think you should wear this towel.

01:13:15.916 --> 01:13:18.125
- It's a good accessory.
- It's very stylish.

01:13:18.125 --> 01:13:19.458
- Don't you think?
- Yeah.

01:13:24.666 --> 01:13:27.666
Oy! Hey! Hey, slow down!

01:13:27.666 --> 01:13:29.916
- Feel the breeze, Grandma!
- Oh my, ah!

01:13:29.916 --> 01:13:32.333
I can see why you fell for him so hard.

01:13:35.625 --> 01:13:37.208
You’re wearin' the suit
for me, huh?

01:13:37.208 --> 01:13:39.916
-  Yeah. Lydia gets the suit.
-  Oh, it's for Lydia.

01:13:50.916 --> 01:13:52.541
- We love you guys!
- Thank you for coming.

01:13:52.541 --> 01:13:54.000
Lydia! Look at you!

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:55.375
Oh my God!

01:13:55.375 --> 01:13:56.875
- This is exquisite!

01:13:57.500 --> 01:14:00.750
Gabi, you've outdone yourself, girl.
Really, it's gorgeous.

01:14:00.750 --> 01:14:02.541
Stacy, I'm so glad you came!

01:14:02.541 --> 01:14:04.833
Lydia said you've been so busy
with show choir.

01:14:05.791 --> 01:14:07.291
Yeah, the show's going really great.

01:14:07.291 --> 01:14:08.625
That's exciting.

01:14:08.625 --> 01:14:09.708
Can you girls believe it?

01:14:09.708 --> 01:14:12.500
You've been planning this
your whole lives, and it's finally here!

01:14:12.500 --> 01:14:15.833
Uh, well, it's time to get hammered.

01:14:15.833 --> 01:14:16.791
Okay.

01:14:16.791 --> 01:14:18.541
Ooh, maybe he'll pass out.

01:14:18.541 --> 01:14:21.541
You! I saw you today at temple.
The <i>Haftarah</i>.

01:14:21.541 --> 01:14:22.833
Spot on.

01:14:22.833 --> 01:14:25.458
- Thank you, Mr. Friedman.
- Lydia, you look so pretty!

01:14:25.458 --> 01:14:26.583
Well, thank you.

01:14:26.583 --> 01:14:30.333
- You got the Twizzlers station?
- Yeah, it's back there. I got it for you.

01:14:30.333 --> 01:14:32.083
Yay!

01:14:32.083 --> 01:14:35.000
Your New York theme
is gonna be amazing!

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.083
Thank you for coming, madam.

01:14:37.083 --> 01:14:39.291
Well,
thank you for inviting me.

01:14:39.291 --> 01:14:41.000
Lyd! There you are!

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:42.583
-  Hey!
- You're up! Come on!

01:14:42.583 --> 01:14:43.833
Ready for your grand entrance?

01:14:44.750 --> 01:14:46.666
Come on! Places, cutie-pops.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:49.666
- See you after.
- That's a good impression.

01:14:49.666 --> 01:14:50.833
See you. Bye, Ronnie!

01:14:50.833 --> 01:14:53.041
- That felt good, huh?
- Yeah.

01:14:54.500 --> 01:14:55.375
- Wow!
- Wow!

01:14:57.250 --> 01:14:58.875
-  Hey!
-  Oh, hey!

01:14:58.875 --> 01:15:01.250
We're sitting with the Lamonsoffs.
I love it!

01:15:01.250 --> 01:15:02.375
Good to see ya.

01:15:05.125 --> 01:15:06.166
What up?

01:15:06.708 --> 01:15:09.166
You ready, DJ? The party's starting.

01:15:09.166 --> 01:15:13.000
All right, I'll be right there!
I'm just getting my mind right!

01:15:17.958 --> 01:15:19.541
It's Schmuley time.

01:15:21.500 --> 01:15:22.583
So let's go.

01:15:24.291 --> 01:15:29.125
All right! Put your hands up in the air
like you just don't care, because...

01:15:29.125 --> 01:15:34.166
It is officially
Lydia Katz Rodriguez's Bat Mitzvah!

01:15:36.541 --> 01:15:39.541
Woo!
Oh yeah, you got it, Grandma!

01:15:44.833 --> 01:15:47.750
Yeah, nobody does it
like DJ Schmuley, huh?

01:15:47.750 --> 01:15:48.833
I guess.

01:16:00.625 --> 01:16:03.000
My little sweet baby.

01:16:05.833 --> 01:16:06.958
<i>Bubelah!</i>

01:16:06.958 --> 01:16:07.916
<i>Tatelah!</i>

01:16:07.916 --> 01:16:09.000
<i>Meydelah!</i>

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.416
<i>Shayna punim!</i>

01:16:16.958 --> 01:16:19.791
- Remember that? Kindergarten, first day?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:16:19.791 --> 01:16:21.458
Yeah, you took my parking spot.

01:16:21.958 --> 01:16:24.208
Mm-hmm.
Not sure that was me, but either way.

01:16:24.208 --> 01:16:25.291
Okay.

01:16:28.375 --> 01:16:30.416
<i>If that was you and a boy,
what would you do?</i>

01:16:41.708 --> 01:16:43.750
<i>We're waiting for her
to pop a pimple.</i>

01:16:43.750 --> 01:16:45.750
Stace, what's going on?
What are you doing?

01:16:48.833 --> 01:16:49.750
<i>Look at that.</i>

01:16:50.875 --> 01:16:52.416
<i>Why do you always do that?</i>

01:16:52.416 --> 01:16:54.416
<i>Because I like the way my feet smell!</i>

01:16:54.416 --> 01:16:55.958
<i>This isn't normal!</i>

01:16:57.666 --> 01:16:59.750
Schmuley, turn off the video.
Please, please, please!

01:16:59.750 --> 01:17:02.708
Schmuley! Turn off the video!

01:17:02.708 --> 01:17:04.750
It's getting big reactions.
What's wrong with it?

01:17:04.750 --> 01:17:08.083
It's getting a horrible reaction!
Please, just turn it off!

01:17:08.083 --> 01:17:10.208
-  <i>She sounds like a lawnmower.</i>

01:17:11.750 --> 01:17:13.208
<i>That was not a snore!</i>

01:17:14.750 --> 01:17:16.666
-  <i>What's that smell?
-</i> Oh God.

01:17:16.666 --> 01:17:18.958
<i>Kym and Megan and Anya, they suck.</i>

01:17:18.958 --> 01:17:20.333
<i>They're horrible.</i>

01:17:20.333 --> 01:17:24.291
<i>Oh, I want cute, designer stuff,
but make sure it's, like, eco-friendly.</i>

01:17:24.291 --> 01:17:26.000
- I'm sorry.
-  <i>They're very dumb.</i>

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:27.166
It's kinda true though.

01:17:27.166 --> 01:17:29.125
Shut up! It's not.

01:17:29.125 --> 01:17:31.458
<i>- I got a full booger.
- Stop! Erase that right now. Please!</i>

01:17:32.666 --> 01:17:34.250
<i>Her real toes are hairy.</i>

01:17:34.250 --> 01:17:36.750
<i>Remember when that string
on my tampon broke?</i>

01:17:36.750 --> 01:17:38.125
<i>I think I peed myself!</i>

01:17:38.125 --> 01:17:39.666
Oh my God.

01:17:39.666 --> 01:17:42.291
<i>Have you ever farted from the front?</i>

01:17:42.291 --> 01:17:43.833
<i>Yeah, like your vajayjay?</i>

01:17:43.833 --> 01:17:45.541
-  <i>Want me to show you?</i>
-  <i>Yes.</i>

01:17:45.541 --> 01:17:46.833
<i>I have to prepare.</i>

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:51.708
<i>I was showing them how to queef.</i>

01:17:51.708 --> 01:17:54.041
Is that
what kids talk about today?

01:17:54.041 --> 01:17:56.291
Tampons and frontal farts?

01:17:56.291 --> 01:17:58.041
<i>You better not show this to anyone.</i>

01:17:58.041 --> 01:17:59.041
<i>Oh my God.</i>

01:17:59.041 --> 01:18:01.166
<i>I swear to God,
if you show this to anyone...</i>

01:18:01.166 --> 01:18:03.416
- Schmuley did this?
- I... I--

01:18:03.416 --> 01:18:04.458
Schmuley?

01:18:04.458 --> 01:18:08.958
<i>Thanks for watching, bye!</i>

01:18:12.583 --> 01:18:14.208
- Why would Stacy do that?
- I don't know.

01:18:19.208 --> 01:18:20.625
Okay, even I'm not that mean.

01:18:20.625 --> 01:18:22.583
- You're pretty mean.
- Yeah, you suck.

01:18:39.416 --> 01:18:40.833
Turn it off, turn it off!

01:18:40.833 --> 01:18:43.291
Lydia! Lydia, I didn't mean to--

01:18:43.291 --> 01:18:45.666
Stop! You didn't mean to?

01:18:45.666 --> 01:18:48.458
Like you didn't mean to tell everyone
I had a black hair on my nipple,

01:18:48.458 --> 01:18:49.791
or that Andy was my first kiss?

01:18:49.791 --> 01:18:52.208
- No, but this is different!
- Just stop lying, Stacy!

01:18:52.208 --> 01:18:54.916
I have tried to apologize,
but you keep punishing me!

01:18:54.916 --> 01:18:57.375
- When is it enough, Stacy?
- Now, it's enough!

01:18:57.375 --> 01:18:58.375
It's too late!

01:18:58.875 --> 01:18:59.833
Lydia!

<i>♪ A picture of me... ♪</i>

01:19:15.916 --> 01:19:18.250
I should go up and see her.
I gotta talk to her.

01:19:18.250 --> 01:19:20.750
No, I'm the one who sent the damn video.
I should go.

01:19:20.750 --> 01:19:24.000
Neither of you guys should go up there.
She needs to process this herself.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:25.000
No, honey, she needs--

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.166
I know what she needs
'cause I know how she's feeling.

01:19:27.166 --> 01:19:28.625
How would you know what she's feeling?

01:19:28.625 --> 01:19:31.291
Even your crazy ass
never did anything that stupid.

01:19:31.291 --> 01:19:33.625
True, but I've seen some similar TikToks.

01:19:33.625 --> 01:19:36.541
And the "even your crazy ass"
was gaslighting.

01:19:37.416 --> 01:19:38.875
Yeah, you're right. Sorry about that.

01:19:38.875 --> 01:19:41.291
This is gonna be difficult
for you to hear, Danny and Bree,

01:19:41.291 --> 01:19:42.791
but from this point forward,

01:19:42.791 --> 01:19:46.875
there's going to be a whole huge part
of Stacy that you don't understand,

01:19:46.875 --> 01:19:49.875
that you won't ever understand,
no matter how much you want to,

01:19:49.875 --> 01:19:51.208
and that's just the way it is.

01:19:52.291 --> 01:19:54.833
Don't ever call us Danny
and Bree again, Zaara.

01:19:54.833 --> 01:19:56.041
Yeah, that was weird.

01:19:56.041 --> 01:19:58.375
Sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Friedman.

01:19:59.750 --> 01:20:01.458
To me, that was gaslighting.

01:20:04.958 --> 01:20:09.291
<i>God, everything is such a mess.</i>

01:20:10.541 --> 01:20:12.583
<i>I've never felt this way before.</i>

01:20:15.458 --> 01:20:18.208
<i>And I don't know how to fix it.</i>

01:20:21.500 --> 01:20:25.291
<i>♪ When you said it was love
Did you mean it? ♪</i>

01:20:25.791 --> 01:20:29.875
<i>♪ Or did I make it up? Did I dream it? ♪</i>

01:20:29.875 --> 01:20:33.875
<i>♪ For a while I was fooled
I believed it ♪</i>

01:20:34.375 --> 01:20:38.166
<i>♪ But you can hang the moon ♪</i>

01:20:42.666 --> 01:20:45.208
<i>♪ But you can hang the moon ♪</i>

01:20:45.208 --> 01:20:49.083
<i>Well, I'm sure you got
this day marked in your holy calendar too,</i>

01:20:49.083 --> 01:20:51.250
<i>but today is my Bat Mitzvah.</i>

01:20:51.250 --> 01:20:54.083
<i>The most important day of my Jewish life.</i>

01:20:54.083 --> 01:20:56.333
<i>Maybe even my entire life.</i>

01:20:56.916 --> 01:20:58.458
<i>But what's the point?</i>

01:20:58.458 --> 01:20:59.791
Let's do this!

01:21:02.375 --> 01:21:04.125
You're kidding me. Again?

01:21:04.125 --> 01:21:06.375
This time, I'm serious. I am not going.

01:21:06.375 --> 01:21:08.708
Oh, you're going.
Get dressed. Get in the car.

01:21:08.708 --> 01:21:10.583
- I can't, and I won't.

01:21:10.583 --> 01:21:13.500
Okay, fine. Say goodbye to your phone.

01:21:15.250 --> 01:21:17.125
Fine. Who am I texting anyway?

01:21:20.625 --> 01:21:24.208
There is nothing you can say or do
that will make me go.

01:21:24.875 --> 01:21:27.541
I'm an adult today,
and I can make my own decisions,

01:21:27.541 --> 01:21:30.166
and I have decided that I am staying here.

01:21:31.458 --> 01:21:34.125
-  Put me down, put me down!
-  Hey. Come on. Hey.

01:21:34.125 --> 01:21:36.333
Ronnie!

01:21:36.333 --> 01:21:39.125
That is some amazing parenting
right there.

01:21:39.125 --> 01:21:41.416
-  No! Don't!
-  Hey.

01:21:46.416 --> 01:21:48.375
Hey, how are those armpits doing?

01:21:48.375 --> 01:21:50.458
You know how they say
that it grows back double?

01:21:50.458 --> 01:21:51.750
It's growing back triple.

01:21:51.750 --> 01:21:52.708
Oh.

01:21:52.708 --> 01:21:53.708
Yeah.

01:21:53.708 --> 01:21:55.333
-  Pull it together!

01:21:58.333 --> 01:22:00.458
-  Calm down.
- I don't want to go.

01:22:00.458 --> 01:22:01.583
Can you stop?

01:22:02.500 --> 01:22:03.625
H-hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

01:22:03.625 --> 01:22:05.791
Shabbat shalom.

01:22:05.791 --> 01:22:07.666
Shabbat shalom.

01:22:07.666 --> 01:22:10.791
Today is a very special day.

01:22:11.291 --> 01:22:13.958
Our brilliant, young Stacy Friedman

01:22:13.958 --> 01:22:17.541
is called to the <i>bimah</i>
for her Bat Mitzvah.

01:22:17.541 --> 01:22:18.875
<i>Oh, God.</i>

01:22:18.875 --> 01:22:22.541
<i>Do you hear her calling me up
to receive an honor I do not deserve?</i>

01:22:23.250 --> 01:22:27.166
<i>I've been dreaming about this day
my whole life, and now it's here.</i>

01:22:27.166 --> 01:22:31.375
<i>And I wish I could go back in bed,
or under my bed, or literally anywhere--</i>

01:22:31.375 --> 01:22:32.458
<i>Seema</i>?

01:22:57.375 --> 01:23:00.333
<i>Barechu et Adonai hamevorach.</i>

01:23:00.333 --> 01:23:05.000
<i>Baruch Adonai
hamevorach leolam vaed.</i>

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:08.000
<i>Baruch Adonai hamevorach leolam vaed.</i>

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:12.541
<i>Baruch Atah Adonai Eloheinu
melech haolam,</i>

01:23:12.541 --> 01:23:15.666
<i>asher bachar banu mikol...</i>

01:23:15.666 --> 01:23:17.208
<i>ha-amim...</i>

01:23:25.708 --> 01:23:28.333
I made a huge mistake.

01:23:29.541 --> 01:23:32.166
I'm sorry.
I don't even know what I'm doing up here.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:41.833
Uh...

01:23:43.458 --> 01:23:47.500
In the Jewish religion,
I am supposed to be a grown-up today.

01:23:48.791 --> 01:23:54.916
But I have been so selfish and bratty
and annoying to my parents who just want...

01:23:54.916 --> 01:23:56.958
<i>And then, it happened.</i>

01:23:56.958 --> 01:23:59.666
<i>The very day I was supposed
to become a woman</i>

01:23:59.666 --> 01:24:01.708
<i>is the day that everything started
to make sense.</i>

01:24:01.708 --> 01:24:03.166
...Nikki, Tara...

01:24:03.166 --> 01:24:06.416
<i>When you're a kid, you think it's okay
to put yourself in front of your friends</i>

01:24:06.416 --> 01:24:08.291
<i>in pursuit of something better.</i>

01:24:08.916 --> 01:24:11.750
<i>A woman knows there is nothing better
than your friends.</i>

01:24:13.250 --> 01:24:14.541
...Kym, Megan, Anya...

01:24:14.541 --> 01:24:15.708
<i>When you're a kid,</i>

01:24:15.708 --> 01:24:19.166
<i>sometimes you think you have to be
someone you're not in order to fit in.</i>

01:24:19.166 --> 01:24:22.791
...if I'm being honest, it's probably 'cause
we were, like, jealous or something...

01:24:22.791 --> 01:24:25.375
<i>But a woman knows
it's not about hiding who you are.</i>

01:24:25.375 --> 01:24:27.375
<i>It's about being yourself
and speaking your truth.</i>

01:24:27.375 --> 01:24:30.750
...but also, you guys can be,
like, such a-holes sometimes.

01:24:32.041 --> 01:24:33.625
Keep it PG in the temple.

01:24:33.625 --> 01:24:34.750
Sorry.

01:24:34.750 --> 01:24:37.166
Where'd she learn to curse like that?

01:24:37.166 --> 01:24:38.291
No idea.

01:24:38.291 --> 01:24:41.500
<i>And the biggest difference
between being a kid and an adult...</i>

01:24:41.500 --> 01:24:42.625
Andy...

01:24:43.458 --> 01:24:45.416
<i>...is knowing what really matters.</i>

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:49.333
I'm gonna keep it brief 'cause I know you
can't focus on one thing for that long,

01:24:49.333 --> 01:24:52.500
but you're basic and not nice to people,

01:24:52.500 --> 01:24:55.083
and if I'm being honest,
not that good at soccer.

01:24:56.458 --> 01:24:57.541
You suck!

01:24:58.500 --> 01:25:00.541
And worst of all, because of you,

01:25:01.250 --> 01:25:04.708
I ruined my friendship
with the one person that matters the most.

01:25:05.625 --> 01:25:07.375
I need to tell her how bad I messed up.

01:25:08.583 --> 01:25:09.625
Hey, hey, hey...

01:25:09.625 --> 01:25:12.125
You gotta go up there and finish
your Torah portion before you go.

01:25:12.125 --> 01:25:16.000
Come here. Give it your best shot,
and then we'll all fix this together.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.208
Hopefully, after I take off
this itchy suit.

01:25:19.750 --> 01:25:21.000
You have coffee breath.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:24.000
Okay. All right. Use that up there. Go.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:28.583
<i>Quickly, so quickly, so quickly.</i>

01:25:28.583 --> 01:25:30.291
<i>So quickly.</i>

01:25:36.666 --> 01:25:40.708
<i>Va-y'chal Moshe mi-dabeyr itam</i>

01:25:40.708 --> 01:25:42.791
<i>Va-yiteyn al panav masveh.</i>

01:25:44.083 --> 01:25:48.541
<i>Uv'vo Moshe lifney Adonai l'dabeyr ito</i>

01:25:48.541 --> 01:25:51.000
<i>Ya-sir et ha-masveh ad tzeyto</i>

<i>V'yatza v'di-ber el b'ney Yisrael

01:25:57.708 --> 01:26:02.083
<i>V'ra-u v'ney Yisrael et p'ney Moshe</i>

01:26:02.083 --> 01:26:08.458

<i>ad bo-oh l'dabeyr ito.</i>

01:26:17.958 --> 01:26:18.833
I did it.

01:26:21.541 --> 01:26:23.500
<i>Ya'sher koach!</i> Now go!

01:27:11.958 --> 01:27:13.041
Lydia!

01:27:15.125 --> 01:27:16.958
Lydia.

01:27:18.958 --> 01:27:19.875
Lydia.

01:27:20.625 --> 01:27:22.000
Lydia, please open--

01:27:23.750 --> 01:27:24.791
The Andy stuff.

01:27:25.291 --> 01:27:27.416
I know you never hurt me on purpose.

01:27:27.416 --> 01:27:29.541
I should have let you apologize.

01:27:30.250 --> 01:27:33.541
I miss you, and I love you, and I'm sorry.

01:27:33.541 --> 01:27:35.500
I've been a horrible, selfish friend.

01:27:35.500 --> 01:27:37.375
Please, please forgive me.

01:27:40.375 --> 01:27:43.250
Stacy, you ruined my Bat Mitzvah.

01:27:43.250 --> 01:27:45.875
What part of that do you not understand?
I don't under-- Like--

01:27:45.875 --> 01:27:48.000
- I know.
- Let me finish.

01:27:48.583 --> 01:27:50.875
That day at the ledge,
I told you not to go.

01:27:50.875 --> 01:27:52.958
I told you don't jump. You jumped.

01:27:52.958 --> 01:27:54.750
Then the whole thing
ended up being my fault.

01:27:54.750 --> 01:27:56.875
- Then I was the shitty friend?
- I'm sorry.

01:27:56.875 --> 01:28:00.583
And I've known you liked Andy for, like,
a million years, but guess what, Stacy?

01:28:00.583 --> 01:28:03.333
So has every other girl at our school,
including me,

01:28:03.333 --> 01:28:06.458
but I never told you anything
because I knew it'd just make you upset.

01:28:06.458 --> 01:28:11.250
And then, when you uninvited me to the day
I've been helping you plan forever,

01:28:12.500 --> 01:28:14.208
I dated him to make you mad.

01:28:14.916 --> 01:28:16.125
Until you ruined it.

01:28:16.916 --> 01:28:19.166
Then you ruined your best friend's
most important day of her life.

01:28:19.166 --> 01:28:20.958
So, yeah, I'm... I'm done here, Stacy.

01:28:20.958 --> 01:28:22.708
Wait, you're right.

01:28:23.458 --> 01:28:25.000
Yeah, I know.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:29.500
Just come to my Bat Mitzvah party tonight.
I promise it'll be worth it. Please.

01:28:34.875 --> 01:28:36.541
I'm gonna take that as a maybe.

01:28:41.416 --> 01:28:42.375
Hello, again.

01:28:48.500 --> 01:28:49.583
Honey?

01:28:50.500 --> 01:28:51.416
Hi, Mom.

01:28:51.416 --> 01:28:53.333
Your father called in
a lot of favors.

01:28:53.333 --> 01:28:56.083
I think it's gonna work out
if she shows up.

01:28:58.291 --> 01:28:59.458
Come on. Let me do it.

01:29:04.250 --> 01:29:07.625
I know tonight's not exactly
what you dreamed it would be,

01:29:07.625 --> 01:29:09.166
but I'm really proud of you.

01:29:10.041 --> 01:29:10.875
Okay, go.

01:29:13.750 --> 01:29:14.625
There.

01:29:16.125 --> 01:29:17.833
-  Hmm.
- Gorgeous.

01:29:17.833 --> 01:29:18.916
Thanks, doll.

01:29:21.750 --> 01:29:23.666
- I have something for you.
- Okay.

01:29:26.166 --> 01:29:29.291
Okay, now,
I know you may not like this, but...

01:29:30.708 --> 01:29:32.875
Really?

01:29:33.458 --> 01:29:34.458
Thank you!

01:29:37.041 --> 01:29:39.000
I think I'm gonna wear sneakers.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.541
Oh my God, you're a woman.
You're a smart woman

01:29:42.166 --> 01:29:43.375
Let's party!

01:29:53.750 --> 01:29:54.750
Is she here?

01:29:55.625 --> 01:29:57.625
I don't think she's coming.

01:29:57.625 --> 01:29:58.791
Honey, she's gonna come.

01:29:58.791 --> 01:30:00.750
<i>May I have your attention?</i>

01:30:00.750 --> 01:30:03.500
It's starting. What if she doesn't come?
Then everything's pointless.

01:30:05.500 --> 01:30:06.750
It's not pointless.

01:30:06.750 --> 01:30:09.916
- I could've been working on my golf game!
- Oh, you're fine.

01:30:09.916 --> 01:30:11.000
You made it.

01:30:12.333 --> 01:30:13.250
I made it.

01:30:13.916 --> 01:30:15.083
Perfect timing.

01:30:15.083 --> 01:30:17.250
Just in time for your grand entrance.

01:30:17.250 --> 01:30:20.000
<i>Listen guys and girls,
ladies and gentlemen...</i>

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:21.291
No, Lydia...

01:30:21.291 --> 01:30:25.833
<i>Please give a very sweet welcome
to your Bat Mitzvah</i>

01:30:27.250 --> 01:30:30.375
Lydia Rodriguez Katz!

01:30:30.375 --> 01:30:31.875
It's time for yours.

01:30:32.833 --> 01:30:34.583
Stacy, what is this?

01:30:35.083 --> 01:30:38.208
You deserve a perfect Bat Mitzvah.
One that no one ruins.

01:30:38.958 --> 01:30:41.125
So you gave up your Bat Mitzvah for me?

01:30:43.375 --> 01:30:44.916
Stacy, this was your dream.

01:30:44.916 --> 01:30:46.291
It's our dream.

01:30:46.291 --> 01:30:47.291
Stacy!

01:30:48.583 --> 01:30:51.500
Yeah, Lydia! We love you!

01:30:51.500 --> 01:30:52.916
We love you!

01:30:55.375 --> 01:30:56.458
Go!

01:30:56.458 --> 01:30:57.916
Okay.

01:30:57.916 --> 01:30:59.666
Entrance. Beautiful.

01:31:01.916 --> 01:31:04.291
Lydia! Lydia! Lydia!

01:31:04.291 --> 01:31:05.958
Lydia!

01:31:05.958 --> 01:31:08.083
Come on, Lydia!

01:31:10.416 --> 01:31:11.583
Go, Lydia!

01:31:28.375 --> 01:31:32.958
All right! Make some noise
for Lydia and Stacy!

01:31:34.958 --> 01:31:38.041
- I'm not paying for this, right?
- Yeah. You are.

01:31:38.041 --> 01:31:40.625
I'm kidding you. You're good. We got this.

01:31:40.625 --> 01:31:45.541
-  Let's get this party started!
- Oh man.

01:31:49.416 --> 01:31:51.125
<i>♪ It's your birthday every day ♪</i>

01:31:53.250 --> 01:31:54.625
