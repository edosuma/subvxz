WEBVTT

02:23.478 --> 02:25.188
Will.

02:26.189 --> 02:28.107
- Why is this happening?
- I don't know.

02:30.526 --> 02:32.779
You look beautiful.

02:34.155 --> 02:37.492
I think it's bad luck for the groom
to see the bride before the wedding.

02:37.659 --> 02:39.494
Make way. Let me through. What in--?

02:39.661 --> 02:40.870
How dare you.

02:41.037 --> 02:42.455
Stand your men down at once!

02:42.622 --> 02:44.749
Do you hear me?

02:45.833 --> 02:48.169
Governor Weatherby Swann,
it's been too long.

02:48.795 --> 02:52.340
- Cutler Beckett?
- It's Lord now, actually.

02:54.133 --> 02:59.347
Lord or not, you have no reason
and no authority to arrest this man.

02:59.847 --> 03:01.224
In fact, I do.

03:01.391 --> 03:02.392
Mr. Mercer.

03:04.894 --> 03:08.356
The warrant for the arrest
of one William Turner.

03:13.444 --> 03:15.279
This warrant is for Elizabeth Swann.

03:15.780 --> 03:18.950
Oh, is it? That's annoying.
My mistake. Arrest her.

03:19.117 --> 03:20.535
- On what charges?
- No!

03:21.786 --> 03:23.413
Here's the one for William Turner.

03:24.372 --> 03:29.377
And I have another one for
a Mr. James Norrington. Is he present?

03:29.544 --> 03:30.837
What are the charges?

03:31.003 --> 03:34.465
Commodore Norrington resigned
his commission some months ago.

03:34.632 --> 03:36.968
I don't believe that was the answer
to the question I asked.

03:37.135 --> 03:40.847
Lord Beckett, in the category of questions
not answered.

03:41.013 --> 03:44.225
We are under the jurisdiction
of the king's governor of Port Royal

03:44.392 --> 03:46.728
and you will tell us
what we are charged with.

03:46.894 --> 03:49.355
The charge is:

03:49.522 --> 03:51.899
"Conspiring to set free a man
convicted of crimes

03:52.066 --> 03:54.277
against the crown and empire

03:54.444 --> 03:56.529
and condemned to death.

03:56.696 --> 03:58.239
For which the--"

03:58.406 --> 04:01.951
For which the punishment, regrettably,
is also death.

04:04.537 --> 04:07.623
Perhaps you remember a certain pirate
named Jack Sparrow.

04:07.790 --> 04:09.542
- Captain.
- Captain.

04:10.918 --> 04:12.378
Captain Jack Sparrow.

04:13.755 --> 04:16.423
Captain Jack Sparrow.

04:16.591 --> 04:19.010
Yes, I thought you might.

04:20.344 --> 04:25.850
<i>Fifteen men on a dead man's chest</i>

04:26.017 --> 04:30.730
<i>Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum</i>

04:30.897 --> 04:36.110
<i>Drink and the devil
Had done for the rest</i>

04:36.277 --> 04:41.991
<i>Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum</i>

05:03.596 --> 05:05.264
Aye there. Come on.

05:05.431 --> 05:08.351
Oh, God. I don't want this.

05:08.518 --> 05:13.689
Oh, God. No. Please help me. No.

05:23.491 --> 05:26.035
No! No!

06:43.696 --> 06:44.697
Sorry, mate.

06:47.950 --> 06:50.536
Mind if we make a little side trip?

06:51.871 --> 06:53.873
I didn't think so.

07:00.463 --> 07:02.131
Not quite according to plan.

07:02.298 --> 07:06.302
Complications arose, ensued,
were overcome.

07:07.929 --> 07:10.681
You got what you went in for, then?

07:13.684 --> 07:16.771
Captain, I think the crew,
meaning me as well,

07:16.938 --> 07:20.274
were expecting something
a bit more shiny.

07:20.441 --> 07:22.693
What with the lsla de Muerta
going all pear-shaped,

07:22.860 --> 07:24.695
reclaimed by the sea
and the treasure with it.

07:24.862 --> 07:27.281
And the Royal Navy chasing us
all around the Atlantic.

07:27.448 --> 07:28.908
- And the hurricane.
- Aye.

07:29.075 --> 07:30.076
- Aye.
- Aye.

07:30.242 --> 07:35.122
All in all, it's seems some time
since we did a speck of honest pirating.

07:37.124 --> 07:40.461
- Shiny?
- Aye, shiny,

07:41.170 --> 07:43.130
Is that how you're all feeling, then?

07:43.297 --> 07:47.093
That perhaps dear old Jack is not serving
your best interests as captain?

07:49.178 --> 07:50.262
Walk the plank.

07:51.055 --> 07:52.264
What did the bird say?

07:52.431 --> 07:54.058
Do not blame the bird.

07:54.225 --> 07:56.644
Show us what is on that piece
of cloth there.

08:05.653 --> 08:09.115
- You know that don't do no good.
- It does me.

08:11.283 --> 08:13.369
- It's a key.
- No.

08:13.536 --> 08:14.537
Much more better.

08:15.746 --> 08:19.000
It is a drawing of a key.

08:24.964 --> 08:26.757
Gentlemen,

08:26.966 --> 08:28.801
what do keys do?

08:29.885 --> 08:31.679
Keys

08:31.846 --> 08:34.140
unlock things?

08:34.306 --> 08:38.102
And whatever this key unlocks, inside,
there's something valuable.

08:38.269 --> 08:41.355
So we're setting out to find
whatever this key unlocks.

08:41.522 --> 08:43.107
No.

08:43.732 --> 08:47.611
If we don't have the key, we can't open
whatever it is we don't have that it unlocks.

08:47.778 --> 08:51.532
So, what purpose would be served
in finding whatever need be unlocked,

08:51.699 --> 08:55.286
which we don't have, without first
having found the key what unlocks it?

08:56.245 --> 08:58.497
So we're going after this key.

08:59.498 --> 09:01.083
You're not making any sense at all.

09:02.543 --> 09:04.378
Any more questions?

09:04.545 --> 09:07.048
So do we have a heading?

09:08.174 --> 09:09.717
A heading.

09:11.385 --> 09:14.138
Set sail in a...

09:14.930 --> 09:16.640
...general...

09:21.520 --> 09:24.190
...that way direction.
- Captain?

09:24.732 --> 09:28.360
Come on, snap to and make sail,
you know how this works. Come on.

09:32.990 --> 09:38.537
Have you noticed lately the captain
seems to be acting a bit strange--

09:38.704 --> 09:39.955
--er?

09:40.122 --> 09:42.750
Setting sail
without knowing his own heading?

09:42.917 --> 09:44.877
Something's got Jack vexed.

09:45.044 --> 09:49.882
Mark my words, what bodes ill
for Jack Sparrow bodes ill for us all.

10:04.188 --> 10:06.649
Lord Beckett,
the prisoner as ordered, sir.

10:06.816 --> 10:08.943
Those won't be necessary.

10:12.863 --> 10:16.075
The East India Trading Company
has need of your services.

10:21.705 --> 10:23.791
We wish for you to act as our agent

10:23.958 --> 10:27.878
in a business transaction
with our mutual friend, Captain Sparrow.

10:28.045 --> 10:30.339
More acquaintance than friend.
How do you know him?

10:30.506 --> 10:32.341
We've had dealings in the past.

10:34.343 --> 10:36.679
And we've each left our mark

10:36.846 --> 10:38.013
on the other.

10:38.180 --> 10:40.432
What mark did he leave on you?

10:43.144 --> 10:46.772
By your efforts,
Jack Sparrow was set free.

10:46.981 --> 10:48.983
I would like you to go to him

10:49.150 --> 10:52.653
and recover a certain property
in his possession.

10:53.779 --> 10:56.448
Recover. At the point of a sword?

10:57.116 --> 10:58.742
Bargain.

11:05.374 --> 11:07.585
Letters of marque.

11:08.794 --> 11:11.338
You will offer what amounts
to a full pardon.

11:11.505 --> 11:15.634
Jack will be free,
a privateer in the employ of England.

11:16.385 --> 11:18.679
Somehow I doubt Jack
will consider employment

11:18.846 --> 11:20.139
the same as being free.

11:21.140 --> 11:22.349
Freedom.

11:24.310 --> 11:27.271
Jack Sparrow is a dying breed.

11:27.771 --> 11:29.732
The world is shrinking,

11:29.899 --> 11:33.027
the blank edges of the map filled in.

11:33.277 --> 11:36.322
Jack must find his place in the new world
or perish.

11:37.281 --> 11:39.992
Not unlike you, Mr. Turner.

11:40.159 --> 11:42.912
You and your fiancée
face the hangman's noose.

11:43.662 --> 11:45.623
So you get both Jack
and the <i>Black</i> Pearl.

11:47.374 --> 11:48.417
<i>The Black Pearl?</i>

11:48.584 --> 11:50.461
The property you want
that he possesses.

11:50.628 --> 11:52.213
A ship? Hardly.

11:52.713 --> 11:56.759
The item in question's considerably
smaller and far more valuable.

11:56.926 --> 12:00.429
Something Sparrow keeps
on his person at all times.

12:00.596 --> 12:01.597
A compass.

12:03.724 --> 12:05.434
You know it.

12:06.810 --> 12:09.063
Bring back that compass

12:09.230 --> 12:11.148
or there's no deal.

12:36.632 --> 12:39.510
Why is the rum always gone?

12:47.476 --> 12:49.186
That's why.

12:56.110 --> 12:58.028
As you were, gents.

13:33.188 --> 13:34.815
Time's run out, Jack.

13:53.709 --> 13:55.711
Bootstrap.

13:56.253 --> 13:57.254
Bill Turner?

14:03.260 --> 14:05.637
You look good, Jack.

14:12.478 --> 14:13.479
Is this a dream?

14:14.521 --> 14:15.522
No.

14:16.231 --> 14:18.776
I thought not. If it were, there'd be rum.

14:27.785 --> 14:30.162
You got the <i>Pearl</i> back, I see.

14:30.913 --> 14:33.916
I had some help retrieving the Pearl,
by the way.

14:35.876 --> 14:36.919
Your son.

14:38.295 --> 14:39.296
William?

14:41.673 --> 14:44.385
Ended up a pirate after all.

14:44.968 --> 14:47.554
And to what do I owe the pleasure
of your carbuncle?

14:48.806 --> 14:49.807
He sent me.

14:52.476 --> 14:53.852
Davy Jones.

14:57.815 --> 14:59.858
So it's you, then.

15:01.568 --> 15:04.780
He shanghaied you into service, eh?

15:04.947 --> 15:06.323
I chose it

15:07.032 --> 15:10.994
I'm sorry for the part I played
in the mutiny against you, Jack.

15:12.830 --> 15:14.915
I stood up for you.

15:15.416 --> 15:18.085
Everything went wrong after that.

15:20.045 --> 15:24.675
They strapped me to a cannon.
I ended up on the bottom of the ocean,

15:24.842 --> 15:27.803
the weight of the water
crushing down on me.

15:27.970 --> 15:29.430
Unable to move.

15:31.432 --> 15:33.684
Unable to die, Jack.

15:33.851 --> 15:39.440
And I thought that even the tiniest hope
of escaping this fate, I would take it.

15:40.107 --> 15:42.568
I would trade anything for it.

15:44.445 --> 15:47.656
It's funny what a man will do
to forestall his final judgment.

15:47.823 --> 15:50.284
You made a deal with him too, Jack.

15:50.451 --> 15:53.036
He raised the <i>Pearl</i>
from the depths for you.

15:53.203 --> 15:54.788
Thirteen years,
you've been her captain.

15:55.205 --> 15:56.457
- Technically-
- Jack.

15:57.374 --> 15:59.751
You won't be able
to talk yourself out of this.

15:59.918 --> 16:02.588
The terms what applied to me
apply to you as well.

16:02.754 --> 16:06.925
One soul bound to crew
a hundred years upon his ship.

16:07.092 --> 16:09.928
Yes, but the <i>Flying</i> Dutchman
already has a captain, so there's really--

16:10.095 --> 16:11.680
Then it's the Locker for you.

16:11.847 --> 16:15.184
Jones's terrible leviathan will find you

16:15.350 --> 16:19.229
and drag the <i>Pearl</i> back to the depths
and you along with it.

16:20.564 --> 16:24.151
Any idea when Jones might release
said terrible beastie?

16:26.153 --> 16:28.030
I already told you, Jack.

16:30.032 --> 16:31.950
The time is up.

16:33.368 --> 16:35.204
It comes now,

16:35.370 --> 16:41.418
drawn with ravenous hunger
to the man what bears the black spot.

16:49.885 --> 16:50.886
On deck, all hands!

16:51.053 --> 16:53.055
Make fast the bunt gasket!

16:53.222 --> 16:55.140
On deck! Scurry!

16:55.307 --> 17:00.938
Scurry. I want movement! Movement.
I want movement! Lift the skin up.

17:01.271 --> 17:02.481
Keep your loof.

17:02.648 --> 17:03.899
Haul those sheets.

17:04.066 --> 17:06.193
Run them. Run. Keep running.

17:06.359 --> 17:08.487
Run as if the devil himself
and itself is upon us!

17:08.654 --> 17:10.489
Do we have a heading?

17:10.656 --> 17:11.865
We run. Land.

17:17.037 --> 17:19.998
- Which port?
- I didn't say port. I said land. Any land.

17:27.089 --> 17:29.633
Jack's hat. Clear about.

17:29.800 --> 17:31.176
No, no. Leave it.

17:33.387 --> 17:34.930
Run.

17:36.682 --> 17:39.518
Back to your stations, the lot of you!

17:48.318 --> 17:53.574
Jack? For the love of mother and child,
Jack, what's coming after us?

17:55.617 --> 17:56.994
Nothing.

19:10.776 --> 19:12.402
Here, now. You can't be here.

19:12.569 --> 19:13.737
I think you'll find he can.

19:15.072 --> 19:16.531
Mr. Swann.

19:16.698 --> 19:18.659
Governor Swann, still.

19:18.825 --> 19:21.036
Do you think I wear this wig
to keep my head warm?

19:22.120 --> 19:25.707
Jack's compass?
What does Beckett want with that?

19:25.874 --> 19:27.250
Does it matter?

19:27.417 --> 19:30.087
I'm to find Jack
and convince him to return to Port Royal.

19:30.253 --> 19:32.631
In exchange, the charges against us
will be dropped.

19:32.798 --> 19:36.343
No. We must find our own avenue
to secure your freedom.

19:36.510 --> 19:38.553
Is that lack of faith in Jack or in me?

19:39.054 --> 19:41.431
That you would risk your life
to save Sparrow's

19:41.598 --> 19:44.434
does not mean that he would do the same
for anyone else.

19:45.435 --> 19:47.020
Now,

19:47.187 --> 19:49.731
where is that dog with the keys?

19:50.440 --> 19:51.692
I have faith in you.

19:53.068 --> 19:54.611
Both of you.

19:57.239 --> 19:59.157
Where will you find him?

19:59.991 --> 20:01.660
Toﬂuga.

20:01.827 --> 20:04.663
I'll start there and I won't stop searching
till I find him.

20:04.830 --> 20:07.457
And then I intend to return here
to marry you.

20:08.667 --> 20:09.668
Properly?

20:09.835 --> 20:11.920
Eagerly, if you'll still have me.

20:13.046 --> 20:15.090
If it weren't for these bars,
I'd have you already.

20:23.515 --> 20:24.808
I'll wait for you.

20:24.975 --> 20:27.936
Keep a weather eye on the horizon.

20:37.654 --> 20:40.490
Captain Jack Sparrow?

20:40.782 --> 20:42.993
Owes me 4 doubloons.

20:44.035 --> 20:45.120
Heard he was dead.

20:45.287 --> 20:47.122
Singapore is what I heard.

20:47.289 --> 20:49.124
Drunk, with a smile on his face.

20:49.291 --> 20:53.420
Sure as the tide,
Jack Sparrow will turn up in Singapore.

20:53.587 --> 20:55.505
Jack Sparrow.

20:55.672 --> 20:57.632
I haven't seen him in a month.

20:57.799 --> 21:01.720
When you find him,
will you give him a message?

21:02.721 --> 21:05.223
Cannot say about Jack Sparrow.

21:05.390 --> 21:08.059
But there's a island,
just south of the straits,

21:08.226 --> 21:10.479
where I trade spice

21:10.979 --> 21:13.899
for delicious long pork.

21:14.816 --> 21:16.610
Cannot say about Jack.

21:16.777 --> 21:18.779
But you find a ship there.

21:18.945 --> 21:21.698
A ship with black sails.

21:28.789 --> 21:30.624
My brother will take you ashore.

21:41.468 --> 21:43.929
What's wrong?
The beach is right there.

21:44.513 --> 21:45.972
What?

22:16.378 --> 22:17.379
Jack!

22:19.047 --> 22:21.716
Jack Sparrow!

22:26.930 --> 22:28.974
Marty!

22:29.766 --> 22:31.518
Cotton!

22:32.519 --> 22:34.271
anybody?

22:40.777 --> 22:41.903
A familiar face.

22:42.571 --> 22:44.239
Don't eat me.

22:44.406 --> 22:45.824
I'm not gonna eat you.

22:45.991 --> 22:50.036
Don't eat me. No. Don't eat me.

23:01.047 --> 23:02.757
Gibbs.

23:33.246 --> 23:35.248
Come on! Let's go!

23:38.376 --> 23:40.170
Come on! Who wants it?

23:43.048 --> 23:45.342
I could do this all day!

24:49.739 --> 24:51.199
Jack?

24:51.366 --> 24:53.326
Jack Sparrow.

24:53.952 --> 24:56.413
I can honestly say I'm glad to see you.

25:05.213 --> 25:09.134
Jack, it's me. Will Turner.

25:14.889 --> 25:17.350
Tell them to let me down.

25:27.986 --> 25:28.987
Snip, snip.

25:36.870 --> 25:38.413
Jack, the compass.

25:38.580 --> 25:40.373
That's all I need. Elizabeth is in danger.

25:40.540 --> 25:42.375
We were arrested for trying to help you.

25:42.542 --> 25:45.253
She faces the gallows!

25:52.177 --> 25:53.178
Savvy?

26:00.477 --> 26:01.770
Save me.

26:02.937 --> 26:04.105
Jack, what did you tell them?

26:05.106 --> 26:06.733
No!

26:07.692 --> 26:09.736
What about Elizabeth?

26:09.903 --> 26:11.613
Jack!

26:13.990 --> 26:15.825
- That's a good girl. Come on.
- Come on now.

26:15.992 --> 26:18.953
- A bit closer.
- We don't bite. Come on.

26:19.412 --> 26:21.122
What is taking your boy?

26:23.625 --> 26:26.294
- Come quickly.
- Where are you going, me lady?

26:26.461 --> 26:27.545
What's happening?

26:27.712 --> 26:29.631
Our name still has some standing
with the King.

26:29.798 --> 26:31.549
I've arranged passage to England.

26:31.716 --> 26:33.927
- The captain is a friend of mine.
- No!

26:34.094 --> 26:35.136
Will is going to find Jack!

26:35.303 --> 26:38.223
We cannot count
on William Turner. Come.

26:38.389 --> 26:40.225
He's a better man
than you give him credit for.

26:40.391 --> 26:44.646
Oh, please. This is no time for innocence.
Beckett has offered one pardon only, one,

26:44.813 --> 26:46.564
and that is promised to Jack Sparrow.

26:46.731 --> 26:48.316
Even if Will succeeds,

26:48.483 --> 26:52.153
do not ask me to endure the sight
of my daughter walking to the gallows.

26:52.320 --> 26:54.072
Do not.

26:54.614 --> 26:58.952
Perhaps I can ensure a fair trial
for Will if he returns.

26:59.119 --> 27:01.454
A fair trial for Will ends in a hanging.

27:01.621 --> 27:04.207
Then there is nothing left for you here.

27:11.297 --> 27:13.174
Wait inside.

27:14.634 --> 27:16.219
Captain.

27:19.097 --> 27:20.640
Captain.

27:26.896 --> 27:28.773
Evening, governor.

27:29.357 --> 27:31.067
Shame, that.

27:31.401 --> 27:33.486
He was carrying this.

27:33.653 --> 27:36.030
It's a letter to the King.

27:36.406 --> 27:37.407
It's from you.

27:38.908 --> 27:40.869
Okay, rank form up to the left.

27:42.120 --> 27:43.830
Elizabeth.

27:45.081 --> 27:47.083
What are you doing?

27:50.086 --> 27:52.797
- Where is she?
- Who?

28:10.440 --> 28:14.485
No doubt you've discovered that loyalty
is no longer the currency of the realm,

28:14.652 --> 28:17.238
as your father believes.

28:17.739 --> 28:19.657
Then what is?

28:20.617 --> 28:23.786
I'm afraid currency
is the currency of the realm.

28:23.953 --> 28:28.374
I expect then that we can come
to some sort of understanding.

28:29.250 --> 28:31.044
I'm here to negotiate.

28:31.211 --> 28:33.171
I'm listening.

28:35.048 --> 28:37.258
I'm listening intently.

28:39.219 --> 28:41.596
These letters of marque,
they are signed by the King?

28:42.055 --> 28:46.434
Yes, and they're not valid
until they bear my signature and my seal.

28:46.601 --> 28:48.269
Or else I would not still be here.

28:49.312 --> 28:52.023
You sent Will to get you the compass
owned by Jack Sparrow.

28:53.483 --> 28:55.026
It will do you no good.

28:55.526 --> 28:57.195
Do explain.

28:57.362 --> 29:01.950
I have been to lsla de Muerta,
I have seen the treasure myself.

29:02.116 --> 29:04.494
There is something you need to know.

29:04.827 --> 29:06.371
I see.

29:06.537 --> 29:09.499
You think the compass leads
only to the lsla de Muerta

29:09.666 --> 29:12.794
and so you hope to save me
from an evil fate.

29:13.544 --> 29:15.630
But you mustn't worry.

29:16.589 --> 29:19.842
I care not for cursed Aztec gold.

29:20.009 --> 29:22.470
My desires are not so provincial.

29:23.263 --> 29:27.475
There's more than one chest of value
in these waters.

29:28.810 --> 29:33.147
So perhaps you may wish
to enhance your offer.

29:35.316 --> 29:39.028
Consider into your calculations
that you robbed me of my wedding night.

29:40.280 --> 29:42.323
So I did.

29:44.325 --> 29:46.786
A marriage interrupted.

29:48.955 --> 29:51.624
Or fate intervenes

29:52.333 --> 29:55.545
You're making great efforts
to ensure Jack Sparrow's freedom.

29:55.712 --> 29:57.505
- These aren't going to Jack.
- Oh, really?

29:58.381 --> 30:01.092
To ensure Mr. Turner's freedom then?

30:01.968 --> 30:04.679
I'll still want that compass.

30:04.846 --> 30:07.432
Consider that in your calculations.

30:28.036 --> 30:31.164
Well, I say it was divine providence
what escaped us from jail.

30:31.331 --> 30:33.916
And I say it was me being clever.

30:35.209 --> 30:37.712
Ain't that right, poochie?

30:37.879 --> 30:41.966
Well, how did you know it weren't divine
providence what inspired you to be clever?

30:42.133 --> 30:44.302
Anyways, I ain't stealing no ship.

30:44.469 --> 30:47.889
It ain't stealing. It's salvaging.

30:48.056 --> 30:51.809
- And since when did you care?
- Since we're not immortal no more.

30:51.976 --> 30:54.395
We gotta take care of our immortal souls.

30:54.562 --> 30:55.730
You know you can't read.

30:56.230 --> 30:58.274
It's the Bible. You get credit for trying.

30:58.441 --> 31:01.986
Pretending to read the Bible's a lie!

31:02.153 --> 31:04.489
That's a mark against:

31:05.656 --> 31:06.824
Look.

31:07.450 --> 31:09.535
There it is.

31:14.332 --> 31:15.708
What's got into him?

31:16.376 --> 31:18.753
Must have seen a catfish.

31:25.468 --> 31:26.677
Stupid mongrel!

31:30.431 --> 31:32.475
You want me to prove it,
give it back to me.

31:32.642 --> 31:34.936
All right! All right!

31:43.611 --> 31:44.612
Come on!

31:52.829 --> 31:54.664
It's ours for the taking.

31:54.831 --> 31:56.958
Tide's coming in, that should help.

31:57.125 --> 31:59.919
Well, salvaging is saving,
in a manner of speaking.

32:00.086 --> 32:01.838
There's the truth of it.

32:09.512 --> 32:12.306
I suppose we better save it
as soon as we can,

32:12.473 --> 32:15.643
what with our souls
in such a vulnerable state and all.

32:15.810 --> 32:17.770
Amen to that.

32:34.579 --> 32:36.164
Thank you.

32:53.556 --> 32:55.308
Why would he do this to us?

32:55.475 --> 32:56.767
If Jack is the chief--

32:56.934 --> 32:59.312
Aye, the Pelegostos made Jack
their chief.

32:59.479 --> 33:02.982
But he only remains chief
as long as he acts like a chief.

33:03.149 --> 33:04.442
So he had no choice.

33:04.609 --> 33:06.486
He's a captive then
as much as the rest of us.

33:06.652 --> 33:08.154
Worse as it turns out.

33:08.654 --> 33:13.034
See, the Pelegostos believe
that Jack is a god in human form

33:13.201 --> 33:17.705
and they intend to do him the honour
of releasing him from his fleshy prison.

33:22.835 --> 33:25.213
They'll roast him and eat him.

33:26.380 --> 33:28.049
Where's the rest of the crew?

33:28.216 --> 33:32.720
These cages we're in weren't built
till after we got here.

33:35.097 --> 33:37.225
The feast is about to begin.

33:37.808 --> 33:40.019
Jack's life will end

33:40.186 --> 33:42.647
when the drums stop.

33:44.190 --> 33:46.776
Well, we can't just sit here
and wait then, can we?

33:49.320 --> 33:50.821
No, no.

33:50.988 --> 33:52.657
No, no. More wood.

33:52.823 --> 33:55.117
Big fire. Big fire.

33:55.284 --> 33:59.080
I am chief. Want big fire. Come on.

34:03.209 --> 34:05.586
Come on. More wood.

35:13.988 --> 35:15.656
Oh, bugger.

35:25.666 --> 35:28.085
Little seasoning, eh?

35:41.474 --> 35:43.142
Well done.

36:22.598 --> 36:24.850
Put your legs through, start to climb!

36:26.977 --> 36:31.065
Come on, men. It'll take all of us
to crew the Black Pearl.

36:31.232 --> 36:33.984
Actually, you wouldn't need everyone.

36:34.151 --> 36:36.779
About six would do.

36:40.032 --> 36:41.742
Oh, dear.

36:45.287 --> 36:46.497
- Hurry!
- Come on, boys!

36:46.664 --> 36:47.832
Come on, go! Go!

36:51.585 --> 36:54.004
Come on! Is that all you got?

36:59.844 --> 37:01.470
- Hey.
- To the top!

37:01.637 --> 37:02.638
- First--
- Wait. Stop.

37:03.681 --> 37:05.224
<i>_ stop-
_ stop-</i>

37:19.029 --> 37:21.490
- What are they doing?
- Stop.

37:22.366 --> 37:24.493
Stop. Stop.

37:28.247 --> 37:29.957
Snake.

37:39.216 --> 37:40.676
Oh, no.

37:47.475 --> 37:49.226
- Move!
- Come on, boys!

38:15.544 --> 38:17.630
Well, go on. Go get them.

38:23.219 --> 38:26.555
No, no.

38:27.890 --> 38:29.433
Not good.

38:45.783 --> 38:47.952
Cut it loose! Find a rock!

39:06.971 --> 39:09.515
- Roll the cage!
- Come on.

39:15.187 --> 39:16.856
No!

39:35.749 --> 39:37.334
Lift the cage! Hurry!

39:37.501 --> 39:40.671
Come on, lads! Lift it like a lady's skirt!

39:45.509 --> 39:47.845
Come on!

40:52.034 --> 40:54.161
This way, lads!

41:16.850 --> 41:17.851
Take cover!

41:19.687 --> 41:21.480
Stop it!

42:16.660 --> 42:18.037
Bugger

42:45.647 --> 42:51.070
Haul loose the mooring line!
The mooring line!

42:51.236 --> 42:54.406
Thief! Little hairy thief! Give it back!

42:54.573 --> 42:57.743
- Don't bite it!
- Haul loose the mooring line!

42:58.243 --> 43:00.454
He's got me eye. He won't give it back.

43:00.621 --> 43:03.957
- Well, how'd you get it back last time?
- Excellent! Our work's half done.

43:04.124 --> 43:06.627
We done it for you,
knowing you'd be coming back for it.

43:06.794 --> 43:08.420
Make ready to sail, boys!

43:08.587 --> 43:10.839
What about Jack?
I won't leave without him.

43:21.100 --> 43:22.267
Time to go.

43:22.434 --> 43:24.061
Cast off those lines!

43:32.903 --> 43:34.613
Make ready to cast off!

43:39.368 --> 43:41.203
Good doggy-

43:57.177 --> 44:00.681
Alas, my children, this is the day
you shall always remember

44:00.848 --> 44:03.350
as the day that you almost--

44:06.520 --> 44:08.814
Captain Jack Sparrow.

44:34.631 --> 44:37.843
Let's put some distance between us
and this island and head out to open sea.

44:38.010 --> 44:39.428
Yes to the first. Yes to the second,

44:39.595 --> 44:42.347
but only insofar as we keep
to the shallows as much as possible.

44:42.514 --> 44:44.433
That seems a bit contradictory, captain.

44:44.600 --> 44:47.769
I have every faith in your reconciliatory
navigational skills, Master Gibbs.

44:47.936 --> 44:50.898
Now, where is that monkey?
I want to shoot something.

44:56.486 --> 44:58.822
Jack. Elizabeth is in danger.

44:58.989 --> 45:00.657
Have you considered keeping
a watchful eye?

45:00.824 --> 45:03.202
- Just lock her up somewhere.
- She is locked up in a prison,

45:03.368 --> 45:04.536
bound to hang for helping you.

45:04.703 --> 45:08.874
There comes a time when one must
take responsibility for one's mistakes.

45:10.918 --> 45:13.170
I need that compass of yours, Jack.

45:13.337 --> 45:14.630
I must trade it for her freedom.

45:18.175 --> 45:20.719
- Mr. Gibbs.
- Captain.

45:20.886 --> 45:23.013
We have a need to travel upriver.

45:24.097 --> 45:27.476
By need, do you mean a trifling need?

45:27.643 --> 45:31.355
Fleeting? As in, say, a passing fancy?

45:31.521 --> 45:35.275
No, a resolute and unyielding need.

45:35.442 --> 45:39.154
What we need to do
is make sail for Port Royal with all haste.

45:39.321 --> 45:41.031
William,

45:41.365 --> 45:47.996
I shall trade you the compass
if you will help me to find this.

45:51.208 --> 45:54.336
- You want me to find this?
- No.

45:54.836 --> 45:57.214
You want you to find this,

45:57.381 --> 46:01.468
because the finding of this
finds you incapacitorially finding

46:01.635 --> 46:04.388
and/or locating in your discovering
the detecting of a way

46:04.554 --> 46:09.017
to save your dolly belle,
ol' what's-her-face. Savvy?

46:12.729 --> 46:15.190
This is going to save Elizabeth?

46:17.609 --> 46:20.570
How much do you know
about Davy Jones?

46:22.739 --> 46:23.740
Not much.

46:24.574 --> 46:27.452
Yeah, it's gonna save Elizabeth.

46:53.812 --> 46:55.939
What's all this?

46:57.107 --> 47:02.070
If you both fancy the dress, you'll just have
to share and wear it one after the other.

47:02.279 --> 47:04.114
No, it's not like that, sir.

47:04.281 --> 47:05.449
This ship is haunted.

47:06.074 --> 47:08.368
Is it, now? And you?

47:08.535 --> 47:12.539
There's a female presence
amongst us here, sir.

47:12.706 --> 47:15.000
- All the men, they can feel it.
- Aye.

47:15.167 --> 47:18.920
It's the ghost of a lady widowed
before her marriage, I figure it,

47:19.087 --> 47:21.298
searching for her husband, lost at sea.

47:21.465 --> 47:23.133
A virgin too, likely as not.

47:24.009 --> 47:26.136
And that bodes ill by all accounts.

47:26.303 --> 47:30.891
I say that we throw the dress overboard
and we hope the spirit follows it.

47:31.058 --> 47:34.019
No! That will just anger the spirit, sir.

47:34.186 --> 47:36.355
What we need to do
is to find out what the spirit needs,

47:36.521 --> 47:38.065
and then just get it back to her.

47:38.231 --> 47:40.359
Enough! Enough!

47:40.525 --> 47:43.362
You're a pair of superstitious goats
and it's got the best of you.

47:44.821 --> 47:48.033
Now, this appears to be no more
as we have a stowaway on board.

47:48.200 --> 47:49.785
A young woman, by the look of it.

47:50.285 --> 47:52.245
I want you to search the ship
and find her.

47:53.038 --> 47:55.749
Oh, and she's probably naked.

48:25.737 --> 48:28.281
Why is Jack afraid of the open ocean?

48:28.448 --> 48:30.742
Well, if you believe such things,

48:31.284 --> 48:33.995
there's a beast does the bidding
of Davy Jones.

48:34.162 --> 48:38.708
A fearsome creature with giant tentacles
that'll suction your face clean off

48:38.875 --> 48:42.421
and drag an entire ship
down to the crushing darkness.

48:44.131 --> 48:45.132
The Kraken.

48:48.552 --> 48:51.805
They say the stench of its breath is...

48:52.514 --> 48:56.101
Imagine, the last thing you know
on God's green earth

48:56.268 --> 48:58.145
is the roar of the Kraken

48:58.311 --> 49:02.023
and the reeking odour
of a thousand rotting corpses.

49:03.942 --> 49:06.403
If you believe such things.

49:06.987 --> 49:08.864
And the key will spare him that?

49:09.489 --> 49:12.909
Well, that's the very question
Jack wants answered.

49:13.118 --> 49:17.289
Bad enough even to go visit her.

49:18.748 --> 49:20.333
Her?

49:20.709 --> 49:22.419
Aye.

49:57.704 --> 49:59.289
No worries, mates.

49:59.456 --> 50:01.333
Tia Dalma and I go way back.

50:01.500 --> 50:02.792
Thick as thieves.

50:02.959 --> 50:05.378
Nigh inseparable, we are.

50:05.545 --> 50:06.671
Were.

50:06.838 --> 50:08.507
Have been.

50:09.007 --> 50:10.050
Before.

50:10.217 --> 50:13.053
- I'll watch your back.
- It's me front I'm worried about.

50:13.220 --> 50:16.348
Mind the boat.

50:16.556 --> 50:19.017
- Mind the boat.
- Mind the boat.

50:19.184 --> 50:20.393
Mind the boat.

50:21.353 --> 50:23.355
Mind the boat.

50:35.325 --> 50:37.827
Jack Sparrow.

50:38.703 --> 50:40.830
Tia Dalma.

50:41.665 --> 50:46.127
I always know the wind was going blow
you back to me one day.

50:50.966 --> 50:52.759
You.

50:55.262 --> 51:03.228
You have a touch of destiny about you,
William Turner.

51:04.980 --> 51:06.773
You know me?

51:07.399 --> 51:09.943
You want to know me.

51:10.110 --> 51:11.570
There'll be no knowing here.

51:11.736 --> 51:14.573
We've come for help
and we're not leaving without it.

51:14.739 --> 51:15.991
I thought I knew you.

51:16.157 --> 51:19.119
Not so well as I had hoped. Come.

51:19.286 --> 51:20.996
Come.

51:24.374 --> 51:29.462
What service may I do you?

51:29.629 --> 51:31.006
You know I demand payment.

51:31.172 --> 51:33.466
I brought payment.

51:37.178 --> 51:38.638
Look.

51:40.307 --> 51:41.808
An undead monkey.

51:42.767 --> 51:44.603
Top that.

51:48.565 --> 51:50.025
No.

51:50.191 --> 51:52.777
You've no idea how long it took us
to catch that.

51:52.944 --> 51:55.780
The payment is fair.

51:55.947 --> 51:57.782
We're looking for this.

52:00.493 --> 52:02.162
And what it goes to.

52:04.664 --> 52:09.294
The compass you bartered from me,
it cannot lead you to this?

52:09.461 --> 52:10.629
Maybe.

52:11.671 --> 52:12.797
Why?

52:12.964 --> 52:15.091
Aye.

52:15.258 --> 52:19.763
Jack Sparrow does not know
what he wants.

52:20.472 --> 52:26.686
Or do you know,
but are loathe to claim it as your own.

52:28.521 --> 52:30.482
Your key go to a chest

52:31.149 --> 52:35.612
and it is what lay inside the chest
you seek, don't it?

52:35.779 --> 52:39.991
- What is inside?
- Gold? Jewels?

52:40.158 --> 52:42.786
Unclaimed properties
of a valuable nature?

52:42.952 --> 52:45.997
Nothing bad, I hope.

52:46.873 --> 52:51.252
You know of Davy Jones, yes?

52:51.419 --> 52:54.089
A man of the sea.

52:54.255 --> 53:01.638
A great sailor until he ran afoul of that
which vex all men.

53:01.805 --> 53:04.349
What vexes all men?

53:06.351 --> 53:08.728
What indeed.

53:09.354 --> 53:11.356
- The sea?
- Sums.

53:11.523 --> 53:13.233
The dichotomy of good and evil.

53:15.110 --> 53:17.153
A woman.

53:17.320 --> 53:20.073
A woman. He fell in love.

53:20.949 --> 53:23.868
No, no, no. I heard it was the sea
he fell in love with.

53:24.035 --> 53:27.956
Same story, different versions,
and all are true.

53:28.123 --> 53:36.673
See, it was a woman, as changing,
and harsh, and untameable as the sea.

53:36.840 --> 53:39.175
Him never stopped loving her.

53:39.342 --> 53:44.013
But the pain it cause him
was too much to live with.

53:44.180 --> 53:46.850
But not enough to cause him to die.

53:48.685 --> 53:53.022
What exactly did he put into the chest?

53:53.189 --> 53:55.108
Him heart.

53:55.275 --> 53:57.485
Literally or figuratively?

53:57.652 --> 54:01.322
He couldn't literally put his heart
in a chest.

54:02.031 --> 54:03.783
Could he?

54:04.159 --> 54:10.206
It was not worth feeling
what small fleeting joy life brings.

54:10.373 --> 54:14.711
And so him carved out him heart,

54:15.378 --> 54:20.842
lock it away in a chest,
and hide the chest from the world.

54:21.009 --> 54:22.844
The key,

54:23.052 --> 54:26.097
he keep with him at all times.

54:28.308 --> 54:30.143
- You knew this.
- I did not.

54:30.310 --> 54:33.146
I didn't know where the key was.
But now we do.

54:33.313 --> 54:35.690
So all that's left is to climb aboard
the Flying Dutchman,

54:35.857 --> 54:39.152
grab the key, you go back to Port Royal,
and save your bonnie lass, eh?

54:39.319 --> 54:41.029
Let me see your hand.

54:56.127 --> 54:58.087
The black spot.

55:00.006 --> 55:01.382
- Black spot.
- Black spot.

55:03.134 --> 55:06.262
My eyesight's as good as ever,
just so you know.

55:06.888 --> 55:09.766
I have just the thing.
Now, where did I put it'?

55:09.933 --> 55:12.435
Must be here somewhere.

55:13.061 --> 55:16.689
My little beauty, where are you?

55:16.856 --> 55:19.359
It's been such a long time
in such a mess.

55:22.529 --> 55:25.240
Davy Jones cannot make port.

55:25.406 --> 55:28.660
Cannot step on land,
but once every ten years.

55:29.369 --> 55:32.038
Land is where you are safe,
Jack Sparrow.

55:32.539 --> 55:35.083
And so you will carry land with you.

55:44.384 --> 55:46.094
Dirt.

55:47.554 --> 55:49.180
This is a jar of dirt.

55:49.639 --> 55:51.099
Yes?

55:53.518 --> 55:56.396
Is the jar of dirt going to help?

55:56.563 --> 55:59.399
If you don't want it, give it back.

55:59.983 --> 56:01.067
No.

56:01.734 --> 56:03.069
Then it helps.

56:05.280 --> 56:09.284
It seems we have a need
to find the <i>Flying</i> Dutchman.

56:13.454 --> 56:18.293
A touch of destiny.

56:32.807 --> 56:34.267
<i>That's the Flying Dutchman?</i>

56:37.103 --> 56:39.981
- She doesn't look like much.
- Neither do you.

56:40.148 --> 56:42.901
Do not underestimate her.

56:43.985 --> 56:45.612
Must have run afoul of the reef.

56:45.778 --> 56:47.947
So, what's your plan, then?

56:48.489 --> 56:51.784
I row over, search the ship
until I find your bloody key.

56:51.951 --> 56:54.078
And if there are crewmen?

56:54.454 --> 56:57.332
I cut down anyone in my path.

56:57.540 --> 57:00.418
I like it. Simple, easy to remember.

57:00.585 --> 57:03.463
Your chariot awaits you, sire!

57:08.051 --> 57:09.886
If you do happen to get captured,

57:10.053 --> 57:13.681
just say Jack Sparrow sent you
to settle his debt.

57:13.848 --> 57:15.099
Might save your life.

57:15.266 --> 57:17.727
Bon voyage!

57:21.814 --> 57:23.942
Douse the lamps.

58:02.063 --> 58:05.817
Hoist jib. Bring up with a round turn.
Captain's orders.

58:05.984 --> 58:08.695
- Sailor.
- Hoist the innerjib. Captain's orders.

58:08.861 --> 58:09.862
Sailor!

58:10.029 --> 58:12.156
Hoisting the jib.
Bring up a round turn.

58:12.323 --> 58:14.158
There's no use. You've run aground.

58:15.076 --> 58:16.411
No.

58:16.577 --> 58:18.371
Beneath us.

58:19.580 --> 58:20.790
Foul breath.

58:34.554 --> 58:37.015
Hey! Hey!

59:14.594 --> 59:17.346
Down on your marrowbones and pray.

59:32.403 --> 59:33.821
Get back!

59:34.489 --> 59:36.199
Back!

01:00:07.855 --> 01:00:11.651
Five men still alive.
The rest have moved on.

01:00:28.668 --> 01:00:32.547
Do you fear death?

01:00:33.172 --> 01:00:38.803
Do you fear that dark abyss?

01:00:39.971 --> 01:00:43.474
All your deeds laid bare.

01:00:43.683 --> 01:00:47.270
All your sins punished.

01:00:48.479 --> 01:00:53.276
I can offer you an escape.

01:00:53.693 --> 01:00:55.194
Don't listen to him!

01:01:05.329 --> 01:01:09.083
Do you not fear death?

01:01:10.877 --> 01:01:12.378
I'll take my chances, sir.

01:01:13.462 --> 01:01:14.672
To the depths.

01:01:21.304 --> 01:01:22.346
Cruel blackguard!

01:01:23.556 --> 01:01:26.267
Life is cruel.

01:01:26.601 --> 01:01:29.270
Why should the afterlife
be any different?

01:01:29.729 --> 01:01:32.982
I offer you a choice.

01:01:33.149 --> 01:01:38.237
Join my crew
and postpone the judgment.

01:01:39.697 --> 01:01:43.951
One hundred years before the mast.

01:01:45.453 --> 01:01:47.371
Will ye serve?

01:01:49.290 --> 01:01:51.209
I will serve.

01:01:51.375 --> 01:01:53.377
There.

01:02:00.635 --> 01:02:04.013
You are neither dead nor dying.

01:02:04.180 --> 01:02:05.765
What is your purpose here?

01:02:09.644 --> 01:02:12.230
Jack Sparrow sent me
to settle his debt.

01:02:14.065 --> 01:02:15.775
What is your purpose here?

01:02:17.276 --> 01:02:21.239
Jack Sparrow sent me
to settle his debt.

01:02:23.407 --> 01:02:25.743
Did he, now?

01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:29.497
I'm sorely tempted to accept that offer.

01:02:46.430 --> 01:02:49.183
You have a debt to pay.

01:02:49.350 --> 01:02:52.895
You've been captain of the <i>Black Pearl</i>
for 13 years.

01:02:53.062 --> 01:02:54.897
That was our agreement.

01:02:55.064 --> 01:02:57.191
Technically I was only captain
for two years,

01:02:57.358 --> 01:02:58.734
then I was viciously mutinied upon.

01:02:58.901 --> 01:03:02.655
Then you were a poor captain,
but a captain nonetheless.

01:03:02.822 --> 01:03:09.787
Have you not introduced yourself
all these years as Captain Jack Sparrow?

01:03:11.664 --> 01:03:14.667
You have my payment. One soul to serve
on your ship. He's already over there.

01:03:14.834 --> 01:03:17.253
One soul is not equal to another.

01:03:18.045 --> 01:03:20.047
We've established my proposal
is sound in principle.

01:03:20.214 --> 01:03:22.091
Now we're just haggling over price.

01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:26.762
Price?

01:03:29.348 --> 01:03:32.768
Just how many souls
do you think my soul is worth?

01:03:36.564 --> 01:03:39.942
One hundred souls.

01:03:40.234 --> 01:03:41.902
Three days.

01:03:42.403 --> 01:03:43.779
You're a diamond, mate.

01:03:43.946 --> 01:03:46.324
Send me back the boy.
I'll get started right off.

01:03:46.490 --> 01:03:49.702
I keep the boy. A good-faith payment.

01:03:49.869 --> 01:03:53.122
That leaves you only 99 more to go.

01:03:55.374 --> 01:03:57.209
Have you not met Will Turner?

01:03:57.376 --> 01:04:00.212
He's noble, heroic, terrific soprano.

01:04:00.379 --> 01:04:02.423
Worth at least four.

01:04:02.798 --> 01:04:04.800
Maybe three and a half.

01:04:05.885 --> 01:04:08.554
And did I happen to mention...

01:04:08.971 --> 01:04:11.057
...he's in love'?

01:04:12.224 --> 01:04:14.185
With a girl.

01:04:14.977 --> 01:04:17.313
Due to be married.

01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:19.690
Betroth ed.

01:04:20.441 --> 01:04:25.112
Dividing him from her and her from him
would only be half as cruel

01:04:25.279 --> 01:04:30.993
as actually allowing them
to be joined in holy matrimony, eh'?

01:04:34.038 --> 01:04:38.876
I keep the boy. Ninety-nine souls.

01:04:39.043 --> 01:04:43.923
But I wonder, Sparrow,
can you live with this?

01:04:44.673 --> 01:04:48.469
Can you condemn an innocent man,
a friend,

01:04:48.636 --> 01:04:54.392
to a lifetime of servitude in your name
while you roam free?

01:04:56.811 --> 01:04:58.771
Yep. I'm good with it.

01:04:58.938 --> 01:05:02.066
Shall we seal it in blood? I mean, ink?

01:05:06.404 --> 01:05:09.073
Three days.

01:05:13.452 --> 01:05:16.997
Three days.

01:05:23.629 --> 01:05:26.257
- Mr. Gibbs.
- Aye.

01:05:26.424 --> 01:05:28.968
I feel sullied and unusual.

01:05:29.135 --> 01:05:34.765
And how do you intend to harvest
these 99 souls in three days?

01:05:34.932 --> 01:05:37.226
Fortunately,
he was mum as to the condition

01:05:37.393 --> 01:05:40.354
in which these souls need be.

01:05:41.105 --> 01:05:42.940
Toﬂuga.

01:05:44.191 --> 01:05:45.526
Toﬂuga.

01:05:49.655 --> 01:05:50.906
It's an outrage.

01:05:51.073 --> 01:05:56.579
Port tariffs, berthing fees, wharf handling
and, heaven help us, pilotage.

01:05:56.745 --> 01:05:59.248
Are we all to work
for the East India Trading Company, then?

01:06:01.125 --> 01:06:05.504
I'm afraid, sir, Tortuga is the only free port
left in these waters.

01:06:05.671 --> 01:06:07.214
A pirate port is what you mean.

01:06:07.381 --> 01:06:09.842
Well, I'm sorry.
An honest sailor is what I am.

01:06:10.009 --> 01:06:13.512
I make my living fair
and I sleep well each night, thank you.

01:06:14.597 --> 01:06:16.390
Sir.

01:06:39.580 --> 01:06:42.249
She wants you to do something.

01:06:45.419 --> 01:06:47.713
She's trying to give a sign.

01:06:56.514 --> 01:06:59.558
Over there. Look for a sign.

01:07:03.812 --> 01:07:05.898
Look, there. There it is.

01:07:06.398 --> 01:07:08.901
- There's the sign.
- That's seaweed.

01:07:09.068 --> 01:07:12.071
- Seaweed can be a sign.
- Looks like entrails.

01:07:12.238 --> 01:07:13.322
That would be a bad sign.

01:07:13.489 --> 01:07:15.616
What's that over there?

01:07:25.543 --> 01:07:29.213
Have mercy, will you?

01:07:35.678 --> 01:07:38.764
And what makes you think
you're worthy to crew the <i>Black Pearl?</i>

01:07:38.931 --> 01:07:41.100
Truth be told,
I've never sailed a day in me life.

01:07:41.267 --> 01:07:44.395
I figure I should get out, see the world
while I'm still young.

01:07:44.562 --> 01:07:46.146
You'll do. Make your mark.

01:07:46.564 --> 01:07:47.815
Next.

01:07:47.982 --> 01:07:53.487
My wife ran off with my dog
and I'm drunk for a month

01:07:53.654 --> 01:07:57.783
and I don't give an ass rat's
if I live or die.

01:07:57.950 --> 01:08:01.662
- Perfect. Next.
- I know what I want. I know what I want.

01:08:01.829 --> 01:08:03.372
Me have one arm and a bum leg.

01:08:03.539 --> 01:08:05.082
It's the crow's nest for you.

01:08:05.249 --> 01:08:07.293
- I know what I want.
- Next.

01:08:07.459 --> 01:08:09.587
Ever since I was a little lad,

01:08:09.753 --> 01:08:13.048
I've always wanted
to sail the seas. Forever.

01:08:13.215 --> 01:08:15.843
Sooner than you think. Sign the roster.

01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:17.303
Thanks very much.

01:08:18.345 --> 01:08:23.434
- How we going?
- Including those four, that gives us four.

01:08:26.937 --> 01:08:29.064
And what's your story?

01:08:29.273 --> 01:08:31.609
My story

01:08:31.817 --> 01:08:36.363
It's exactly the same as your story,
just one chapter behind.

01:08:37.031 --> 01:08:40.326
I chased a man across the seven seas.

01:08:40.658 --> 01:08:45.831
The pursuit cost me my crew,
my commission,

01:08:46.372 --> 01:08:48.334
and my life.

01:08:53.546 --> 01:08:56.759
- Commodore?
- No, not any more. Weren't you listening?

01:09:01.388 --> 01:09:03.890
I nearly had you all off Tripoli.

01:09:04.725 --> 01:09:06.268
I would have,

01:09:06.435 --> 01:09:09.145
if not for the hurricane.

01:09:09.313 --> 01:09:12.733
Lord. You didn't try to sail through it.

01:09:12.899 --> 01:09:17.237
So do I make your crew or not?

01:09:18.447 --> 01:09:21.158
You haven't said where you're going.

01:09:21.325 --> 01:09:23.243
Somewhere nice?

01:09:24.286 --> 01:09:29.582
So am I worthy to serve
under Captain Jack Sparrow?

01:09:32.127 --> 01:09:33.921
Or should I just kill you now?

01:09:41.636 --> 01:09:42.720
You're hired.

01:09:43.930 --> 01:09:45.474
Sorry.

01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:47.350
Old habits and all that.

01:09:47.518 --> 01:09:50.813
- Easy, sailor!
- That's our captain you're threatening.

01:10:04.785 --> 01:10:06.995
- Time to go.
- Aye.

01:10:51.415 --> 01:10:52.875
Thanks, mate.

01:10:59.131 --> 01:11:00.632
Carry on.

01:11:08.348 --> 01:11:09.475
Come on, then.

01:11:09.641 --> 01:11:10.809
Who wants some?

01:11:10.976 --> 01:11:14.396
Form an orderly line.
I'll have you all, one by one.

01:11:14.563 --> 01:11:16.982
Come on, who's first?

01:11:19.568 --> 01:11:21.904
I just wanted the pleasure
of doing that myself.

01:11:31.413 --> 01:11:33.457
I've never liked him.

01:11:49.681 --> 01:11:51.850
James Norrington.

01:11:53.268 --> 01:11:55.646
What has the world done to you?

01:12:24.508 --> 01:12:26.677
Heave!

01:12:26.927 --> 01:12:29.054
Heave!

01:12:29.721 --> 01:12:32.391
Heave!

01:12:35.060 --> 01:12:38.438
- Heave!
- Heave-ho!

01:12:41.483 --> 01:12:45.404
Secure the mast tackle, Mr. Turner.

01:12:48.699 --> 01:12:50.576
Get to it!

01:12:55.873 --> 01:12:58.250
- Step aside.
- Hey, mind yourself.

01:12:58.417 --> 01:13:01.378
- Hey!
- Let go, boy.

01:13:04.131 --> 01:13:05.173
No.

01:13:14.433 --> 01:13:16.977
Haul that weevil to his feet.

01:13:22.190 --> 01:13:26.653
- Five lashes to remind you to stay on her.
- No.

01:13:27.404 --> 01:13:31.283
Impeding me in my duties?

01:13:31.450 --> 01:13:33.869
You'll share the punishment.

01:13:34.036 --> 01:13:35.162
I'll take it all.

01:13:35.329 --> 01:13:37.581
Will you now?

01:13:37.748 --> 01:13:42.920
And what would prompt
such an act of charity?

01:13:46.632 --> 01:13:48.592
My son.

01:13:53.513 --> 01:13:54.723
He's my son.

01:14:07.152 --> 01:14:10.405
What fortuitous circumstance be this.

01:14:10.572 --> 01:14:14.952
Five lashes be owed, I believe it is.

01:14:19.206 --> 01:14:21.792
No. No, I won't.

01:14:21.959 --> 01:14:24.628
The cat's out of the bag, Mr. Turner.

01:14:25.128 --> 01:14:30.509
Your issue will feel its sting,
be it by the boatswain's hand or your own.

01:14:33.762 --> 01:14:35.055
No, no.

01:14:36.932 --> 01:14:39.351
- Boatswain!
- No!

01:15:23.145 --> 01:15:26.440
You had it easy, boy.

01:15:26.606 --> 01:15:30.027
- William.
- I don't need your help.

01:15:31.361 --> 01:15:34.614
The boatswain prides himself
on cleaving flesh from bone

01:15:34.781 --> 01:15:37.034
with every swing.

01:15:37.784 --> 01:15:41.121
So I'm to understand what you did
was an act of compassion.

01:15:42.748 --> 01:15:43.790
Yes.

01:15:50.839 --> 01:15:56.636
One hundred years before the mast,
losing your world bit by bit,

01:15:56.803 --> 01:16:00.265
until you end up like poor Wyvern here.

01:16:02.559 --> 01:16:06.354
Once you've sworn an oath
to the Dutchman, there's no leaving it.

01:16:06.605 --> 01:16:08.482
Not until your debt is paid.

01:16:09.858 --> 01:16:11.193
I've sworn no oath.

01:16:13.987 --> 01:16:15.072
Then you must get away.

01:16:17.574 --> 01:16:19.284
Not until I find this.

01:16:20.994 --> 01:16:22.621
The key.

01:16:30.128 --> 01:16:32.422
The dead man's chest.

01:16:33.632 --> 01:16:34.925
What do you know of this?

01:16:35.801 --> 01:16:40.472
Open the chest with the key
and stab the heart.

01:16:40.639 --> 01:16:43.767
No, no, no. Don't stab the heart.

01:16:43.934 --> 01:16:48.897
The Dutchman needs a living heart
or there'll be no captain.

01:16:49.064 --> 01:16:53.276
And if there's no captain,
there's no one to have the key.

01:16:53.777 --> 01:16:55.195
So the captain has the key?

01:16:57.572 --> 01:17:00.242
- Where is the key?
- Hidden.

01:17:00.700 --> 01:17:01.701
Where is the chest?

01:17:02.244 --> 01:17:04.079
Hidden.

01:17:06.623 --> 01:17:07.666
Captain Sparrow.

01:17:08.542 --> 01:17:10.377
Come to join me crew, lad?
Welcome aboard.

01:17:11.086 --> 01:17:12.546
I'm here to find the man I love.

01:17:14.798 --> 01:17:18.969
I'm deeply flattered, son,
but my first and only love is the sea.

01:17:20.428 --> 01:17:22.848
Meaning William Turner,
Captain Sparrow.

01:17:24.641 --> 01:17:26.017
Elizabeth.

01:17:26.184 --> 01:17:28.103
Hide the rum.

01:17:28.436 --> 01:17:31.690
You know, these clothes do not flatter you
at all. It should be a dress or nothing.

01:17:31.857 --> 01:17:34.609
- I happen to have no dress in my cabin.
- Jack.

01:17:36.945 --> 01:17:38.989
I know Will came to find you.
Where is he?

01:17:40.282 --> 01:17:42.701
Darling, I am truly unhappy
to have to tell you this,

01:17:42.868 --> 01:17:47.455
but through an unfortunate and entirely
unforeseeable series of circumstances

01:17:47.622 --> 01:17:50.500
that have nothing whatsoever
to do with me,

01:17:50.876 --> 01:17:55.505
poor Will has been press-ganged
into Davy Jones' crew.

01:17:56.590 --> 01:17:57.591
Davy Jones?

01:18:00.051 --> 01:18:02.137
Oh, please.

01:18:03.471 --> 01:18:05.765
<i>The captain of the Flying Dutchman?</i>

01:18:05.932 --> 01:18:08.018
You look bloody awful.
What are you doing here?

01:18:08.185 --> 01:18:11.688
You hired me.
I can't help it if your standards are lax.

01:18:11.855 --> 01:18:13.398
- You smell funny.
- Jack.

01:18:15.108 --> 01:18:16.776
All I want is to find Will.

01:18:21.239 --> 01:18:23.074
Are you certain?

01:18:23.241 --> 01:18:25.660
Is that what you really want most?

01:18:26.661 --> 01:18:27.787
Of course.

01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:33.293
Because I would think, you'd want
to find a way to save Will the most.

01:18:34.044 --> 01:18:35.670
And you'd have a way of doing that?

01:18:36.463 --> 01:18:38.798
Well, there is a chest.

01:18:38.965 --> 01:18:41.009
Oh, dear.

01:18:41.259 --> 01:18:43.470
A chest of unknown size and origin.

01:18:43.637 --> 01:18:46.723
What contains the still-beating heart
of Davy Jones.

01:18:46.890 --> 01:18:48.558
Yeah.

01:18:49.976 --> 01:18:51.853
And whoever possesses that chest

01:18:52.020 --> 01:18:53.563
possesses the leverage
to command Jones

01:18:53.730 --> 01:18:55.941
to do whatever it is he or she wants,

01:18:56.107 --> 01:19:00.862
including saving brave William
from his grim fate.

01:19:01.029 --> 01:19:03.490
You don't actually believe him, do you?

01:19:09.287 --> 01:19:10.330
How do we find it?

01:19:13.833 --> 01:19:15.585
With this.

01:19:15.752 --> 01:19:18.630
My compass is unique.

01:19:19.256 --> 01:19:22.634
Unique here
having the meaning of broken.

01:19:23.468 --> 01:19:25.136
True enough.

01:19:25.303 --> 01:19:27.847
This compass does not point north.

01:19:30.141 --> 01:19:31.434
Where does it point?

01:19:33.019 --> 01:19:37.774
It points to the thing
you want most in this world.

01:19:40.443 --> 01:19:42.570
Oh, Jack.

01:19:44.447 --> 01:19:45.615
Are you telling the truth?

01:19:45.782 --> 01:19:47.909
Every word, love.

01:19:48.326 --> 01:19:50.704
And what you want most in this world

01:19:51.663 --> 01:19:56.376
is to find the chest of Davy Jones,
is it not?

01:19:56.543 --> 01:19:57.544
To save Will?

01:19:58.461 --> 01:20:02.090
By finding the chest of Davy Jones.

01:20:17.230 --> 01:20:19.524
- Mr. Gibbs!
- Captain.

01:20:19.691 --> 01:20:21.735
- We have our heading.
- Finally.

01:20:21.901 --> 01:20:25.322
Cast off those lines, weigh anchor
and crowd that canvas!

01:20:26.656 --> 01:20:27.741
Miss Swann.

01:20:27.907 --> 01:20:30.744
- Come on, lads! Make on deck, will you?
- Time to go now, eh.

01:20:30.910 --> 01:20:33.830
Welcome to the crew,
former commodore.

01:20:33.997 --> 01:20:36.666
Right. I remember that.

01:20:40.879 --> 01:20:43.340
There's something to knowing
the exact shape of the world

01:20:43.506 --> 01:20:45.383
and one's place in it, don't you agree?

01:20:45.842 --> 01:20:48.470
I assure you these are not necessary.

01:20:48.636 --> 01:20:50.972
I had you brought here
because I thought you'd be interested

01:20:51.139 --> 01:20:52.974
in the whereabouts of your daughter.

01:20:53.141 --> 01:20:55.393
- You have news of her?
- Most recently seen

01:20:55.560 --> 01:20:56.686
on the island of Tortuga

01:20:56.853 --> 01:21:00.732
then left in the company of a known pirate,
Jack Sparrow,

01:21:00.899 --> 01:21:03.693
and other fugitives from justice.

01:21:03.860 --> 01:21:05.653
Justice. Hardly.

01:21:05.820 --> 01:21:11.493
Including the previous owner
of this sword, I believe.

01:21:12.077 --> 01:21:13.161
Our ships are in pursuit

01:21:13.620 --> 01:21:16.873
and justice will be dispensed
by cannonade and cutlass

01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:20.627
and all manner
of remorseless pieces of metal.

01:21:21.002 --> 01:21:24.339
I personally find it distasteful
to even contemplate the horror

01:21:24.506 --> 01:21:27.092
facing all those on board.

01:21:30.261 --> 01:21:32.013
What do you want from me?

01:21:32.180 --> 01:21:35.266
Your authority as governor,
your influence in London,

01:21:35.433 --> 01:21:38.937
and your loyalty
to the East India Trading Company.

01:21:40.188 --> 01:21:41.523
To you, you mean.

01:21:46.277 --> 01:21:47.904
Shall I remove these shackles?

01:21:52.242 --> 01:21:54.160
Do what you can for my daughter.

01:22:01.835 --> 01:22:04.045
So you see, Mercer,
every man has a price

01:22:04.212 --> 01:22:06.506
he will willingly accept,

01:22:06.965 --> 01:22:10.009
even for what he hopes never to sell.

01:22:16.474 --> 01:22:20.228
I wager ten years.

01:22:20.437 --> 01:22:23.314
I'll match ten years.

01:22:23.773 --> 01:22:25.483
Agreed.

01:22:27.735 --> 01:22:30.655
- Four fours.
- Wondering how it's played?

01:22:31.364 --> 01:22:32.615
I understand.

01:22:32.782 --> 01:22:35.076
- Liar!
- It's a game of deception.

01:22:35.243 --> 01:22:38.830
But your bet includes all the dice
not just your own.

01:22:39.289 --> 01:22:42.250
- What are they wagering?
- Oh, the only thing we have.

01:22:42.417 --> 01:22:44.752
Years of service.

01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:51.092
- So any crewmember can be challenged?
- Aye, anyone.

01:22:53.970 --> 01:22:57.015
I challenge Davy Jones.

01:23:16.409 --> 01:23:18.745
I accept that.

01:23:30.924 --> 01:23:32.258
The stakes?

01:23:32.926 --> 01:23:34.677
My soul.

01:23:34.844 --> 01:23:36.429
An eternity of servitude.

01:23:36.596 --> 01:23:38.139
No.

01:23:40.934 --> 01:23:42.393
Against?

01:23:43.895 --> 01:23:45.980
I want this.

01:23:58.117 --> 01:24:00.078
How do you know of the key?

01:24:00.537 --> 01:24:03.039
That's not part of the game, is it?

01:24:06.209 --> 01:24:07.669
You can still walk away.

01:24:33.528 --> 01:24:36.531
- What's this?
- I'm in. Matching his wager.

01:24:36.698 --> 01:24:37.782
No!

01:24:38.283 --> 01:24:39.492
Don't do this.

01:24:41.494 --> 01:24:43.162
The die is cast.

01:24:44.330 --> 01:24:45.999
I bet three twos.

01:24:47.542 --> 01:24:49.669
It's your bid, captain.

01:24:56.050 --> 01:24:59.220
Four fours.

01:25:08.062 --> 01:25:09.105
Four fives

01:25:11.399 --> 01:25:12.984
Six threes.

01:25:22.744 --> 01:25:26.456
Seven fives.

01:25:49.729 --> 01:25:51.022
Eight fives.

01:25:56.778 --> 01:26:00.907
Welcome to the crew, lad.

01:26:02.492 --> 01:26:03.951
Twelve fives.

01:26:05.703 --> 01:26:07.330
Twelve fives.

01:26:07.497 --> 01:26:10.208
Call me a liar or up the bid.

01:26:11.584 --> 01:26:15.380
And be called a liar myself
for my trouble?

01:26:18.591 --> 01:26:23.429
Bootstrap Bill, you're a liar
and you will spend an eternity on this ship!

01:26:25.431 --> 01:26:30.144
Master Turner, feel free to go ashore

01:26:30.978 --> 01:26:34.691
the very next time we make port.

01:26:41.656 --> 01:26:43.157
Fool.

01:26:43.324 --> 01:26:45.535
Why did you do that?

01:26:46.744 --> 01:26:48.496
I couldn't let you lose.

01:26:49.038 --> 01:26:51.749
It was never about winning or losing.

01:26:54.210 --> 01:26:55.586
The key.

01:26:57.380 --> 01:27:00.091
You just wanted to know where it was.

01:27:19.861 --> 01:27:22.572
Captain says I'm to relieve you.

01:27:26.451 --> 01:27:28.453
Captain's orders.

01:29:18.354 --> 01:29:20.898
Here. Take this too.

01:29:21.899 --> 01:29:24.861
Now, get yourself to land,
and stay there.

01:29:25.736 --> 01:29:28.823
It was always in my blood to die at sea.

01:29:29.073 --> 01:29:30.950
It was not a fate I ever wanted for you.

01:29:36.914 --> 01:29:39.876
It's not a fate you had to choose
for yourself, either.

01:29:40.626 --> 01:29:42.128
Aye.

01:29:42.295 --> 01:29:47.550
I could say I did what I had to,
when I left you to go pirating.

01:29:47.800 --> 01:29:50.761
But it would taste a lie
to say it wasn't what I wanted.

01:29:53.848 --> 01:29:56.267
You owe me nothing, Will.

01:29:56.642 --> 01:29:57.643
Now go.

01:29:59.896 --> 01:30:01.981
They'll know you helped me.

01:30:04.066 --> 01:30:05.943
What more can they do to me?

01:30:11.866 --> 01:30:14.035
I take this with a promise.

01:30:14.201 --> 01:30:16.495
I'll find a way
to sever Jones's hold on you,

01:30:16.662 --> 01:30:19.040
and not rest
until this blade pierces his heart.

01:30:22.084 --> 01:30:24.337
I will not abandon you.

01:30:27.006 --> 01:30:28.466
I promise.

01:30:43.773 --> 01:30:45.816
- Beckett?
- Yes, they're signed.

01:30:45.983 --> 01:30:48.486
Lord Cutler Beckett
of the East India Trading Company.

01:30:50.154 --> 01:30:53.741
Will was working for Beckett
and never said a word.

01:30:54.200 --> 01:30:56.285
Beckett wants the compass.

01:30:56.452 --> 01:30:57.954
Only one reason for that.

01:30:58.120 --> 01:31:00.039
Of course.

01:31:00.706 --> 01:31:01.916
He wants the chest.

01:31:02.375 --> 01:31:04.377
Yes, he did say something
about a chest.

01:31:04.543 --> 01:31:07.713
If the company controls the chest,
they controls the sea.

01:31:07.880 --> 01:31:11.926
- A truly discomfiting notion, love.
- And bad.

01:31:12.093 --> 01:31:14.804
Bad for every mother's son
what calls himself a pirate.

01:31:15.846 --> 01:31:18.975
I think there's a bit more speed
to be coaxed from these sails.

01:31:19.141 --> 01:31:21.227
Brace the foreyard!

01:31:21.394 --> 01:31:24.105
Might I enquire
as to how you came by these?

01:31:24.689 --> 01:31:25.773
Persuasion.

01:31:25.940 --> 01:31:28.317
- Friendly?
- Decidedly not.

01:31:28.484 --> 01:31:30.945
Will strikes a deal for these
and upholds it with honour,

01:31:31.112 --> 01:31:33.030
yet you are the one standing here
with the prize.

01:31:33.197 --> 01:31:34.991
"Full pardon.
Commission as a privateer

01:31:35.157 --> 01:31:39.161
on behalf of England
and the East India Trading Company."

01:31:39.328 --> 01:31:41.706
As if I could be bought
for such a low price.

01:31:41.872 --> 01:31:44.959
- Jack, the letters, give them back.
- No. Persuade me.

01:31:46.711 --> 01:31:50.131
You do know Will taught me
how to handle a sword?

01:31:52.883 --> 01:31:56.470
As I said, persuade me.

01:32:10.860 --> 01:32:13.237
It's a curious thing.

01:32:14.238 --> 01:32:16.157
There was a time
when I would have given anything

01:32:16.323 --> 01:32:19.577
for you to look like that
while thinking about me.

01:32:20.119 --> 01:32:22.288
- I don't know what you mean.
- Oh, I think you do.

01:32:22.455 --> 01:32:25.332
Oh, don't be absurd.
I trust him, that's all.

01:32:30.129 --> 01:32:32.173
So you never wondered
how your latest fiancé

01:32:32.339 --> 01:32:35.634
<i>ended up on the Flying Dutchman
in the first place?</i>

01:33:01.035 --> 01:33:04.288
Strange thing to come upon a longboat
so far out in open waters.

01:33:04.455 --> 01:33:07.708
Just put as many leagues behind us
as you can. As fast as you can.

01:33:07.875 --> 01:33:09.085
And what are we running from'?

01:33:15.841 --> 01:33:18.511
That dress. Where did you get it?

01:33:18.677 --> 01:33:20.304
It was found aboard the ship.

01:33:20.471 --> 01:33:24.642
The crew thought it was a spirit
bringing some omen of ill-fate.

01:33:25.059 --> 01:33:28.646
- That's foolish.
- Oh, yes. Exceedingly foolish.

01:33:28.813 --> 01:33:30.523
It brought good fortune.

01:33:30.689 --> 01:33:36.821
The spirit told us, "Pull in at Tortuga",
and we made a nice bit of profit there.

01:33:36.987 --> 01:33:39.115
Off the books, of course.

01:33:39.990 --> 01:33:43.619
I imagine some of your crew
may have jumped ship there.

01:33:43.786 --> 01:33:44.787
Why do you ask?

01:33:44.954 --> 01:33:46.664
Captain, a ship's been spotted.

01:33:46.831 --> 01:33:48.582
- Colours?
- She isn't flying any.

01:33:49.708 --> 01:33:51.627
- Pirates.
- Or worse.

01:34:03.180 --> 01:34:06.350
You will watch this.

01:34:13.941 --> 01:34:16.861
Let no joyful voice be heard.

01:34:18.988 --> 01:34:22.199
Let no man look up at the sky
with hope.

01:34:24.493 --> 01:34:30.166
And let this day be cursed
by we who ready to wake...

01:34:31.750 --> 01:34:33.794
...the Kraken.

01:34:33.961 --> 01:34:35.880
No!

01:34:38.841 --> 01:34:41.051
What kind of ship?

01:34:41.969 --> 01:34:43.470
What is it?

01:34:46.724 --> 01:34:48.642
Starboard.

01:34:52.855 --> 01:34:54.899
I've doomed us all.

01:34:55.858 --> 01:34:58.819
It's the Flying Dutchman!

01:35:03.657 --> 01:35:05.993
Oh, Mother Carey's chickens!
What happened?

01:35:06.160 --> 01:35:07.453
Must have hit a reef.

01:35:16.670 --> 01:35:19.423
Free the rudder!
Hard to port then harder starboard!

01:35:19.590 --> 01:35:22.843
- Free the rudder!
- Hard to port!

01:35:30.184 --> 01:35:31.560
Kraken!

01:35:31.727 --> 01:35:33.604
- Kraken!
- To arms!

01:35:34.313 --> 01:35:36.273
To arms!

01:35:43.614 --> 01:35:46.408
- Now!
- Take up the axe!

01:35:47.201 --> 01:35:50.079
Here it is! Take it!

01:35:50.246 --> 01:35:51.956
Take it!

01:36:05.719 --> 01:36:07.179
Kraken!

01:36:33.330 --> 01:36:35.249
Go!

01:38:04.213 --> 01:38:05.464
The boy's not here.

01:38:05.631 --> 01:38:08.342
He must have been claimed by the sea.

01:38:08.801 --> 01:38:11.762
I am the sea.

01:38:14.973 --> 01:38:19.103
You need time alone
with your thoughts. Brig!

01:38:19.269 --> 01:38:20.729
What of the survivors?

01:38:26.360 --> 01:38:29.238
There are no survivors.

01:38:49.883 --> 01:38:51.718
The chest is no longer safe.

01:38:51.885 --> 01:38:54.138
Chart a course to lsla Cruces.

01:38:54.304 --> 01:38:56.515
Get me there first
or there'll be the devil to pay.

01:38:56.682 --> 01:38:58.434
First?

01:38:58.600 --> 01:39:01.687
Who sent that thieving charlatan
onto my ship?

01:39:01.854 --> 01:39:03.772
Who told them of the key?

01:39:06.942 --> 01:39:09.027
Jack Sparrow.

01:39:27.504 --> 01:39:29.506
My tremendous intuitive sense
of the female creature

01:39:29.673 --> 01:39:32.384
informs me that you are troubled.

01:39:34.428 --> 01:39:36.013
I just thought I'd be married by now.

01:39:37.848 --> 01:39:40.058
I'm so ready to be married.

01:39:47.816 --> 01:39:49.526
You know,

01:39:51.487 --> 01:39:53.113
Lizzie,

01:39:53.322 --> 01:39:56.825
I am captain of a ship.

01:39:56.992 --> 01:40:03.415
And being captain of a ship, I could,
in fact, perform a marriage,

01:40:03.582 --> 01:40:05.334
right here,

01:40:05.501 --> 01:40:07.628
right on this deck,

01:40:07.920 --> 01:40:09.838
right now.

01:40:13.634 --> 01:40:15.802
No, thank you.

01:40:15.969 --> 01:40:17.429
Why not?

01:40:17.596 --> 01:40:20.682
We are very much alike, you and I.
I and you. Us.

01:40:20.849 --> 01:40:25.687
Oh, except for a sense of honour
and a decency and a moral centre.

01:40:26.355 --> 01:40:27.439
And personal hygiene.

01:40:30.108 --> 01:40:31.902
Trifles

01:40:32.569 --> 01:40:35.030
You will come over to my side,
I know it.

01:40:35.447 --> 01:40:37.032
You seem very certain.

01:40:37.199 --> 01:40:40.369
One word, love: curiosity.

01:40:40.536 --> 01:40:42.079
You long for freedom.

01:40:42.246 --> 01:40:45.249
You long to do what you want to do
because you want it.

01:40:45.415 --> 01:40:48.335
To act on selfish impulse.

01:40:48.502 --> 01:40:50.963
You want to see what it's like.

01:40:51.421 --> 01:40:52.923
One day,

01:40:53.090 --> 01:40:55.759
you won't be able to resist.

01:40:56.343 --> 01:40:57.886
Why doesn't your compass work?

01:41:00.639 --> 01:41:03.141
My compass works fine.

01:41:04.101 --> 01:41:05.769
Because you and I are alike.

01:41:05.936 --> 01:41:08.730
And there will come a moment
when you have the chance to show it.

01:41:09.189 --> 01:41:10.899
To do the right thing.

01:41:11.066 --> 01:41:12.568
I love those moments.

01:41:13.151 --> 01:41:15.362
I like to wave at them as they pass by.

01:41:15.529 --> 01:41:20.534
You'll have the chance
to do something-- Something courageous.

01:41:21.159 --> 01:41:22.828
And when you do,
you'll discover something.

01:41:24.496 --> 01:41:26.832
That you're a good man.

01:41:27.124 --> 01:41:29.501
All evidence to the contrary.

01:41:29.668 --> 01:41:31.378
Oh, I have faith in you.

01:41:32.838 --> 01:41:36.216
- Want to know why?
- Do tell, dearie.

01:41:37.551 --> 01:41:39.553
Curiosity.

01:41:40.470 --> 01:41:41.805
You're going to want it.

01:41:43.599 --> 01:41:47.394
A chance to be admired
and gain the rewards that follow.

01:41:48.812 --> 01:41:51.231
You won't be able to resist.

01:41:52.441 --> 01:41:55.110
You're going to want to know

01:41:55.611 --> 01:41:57.529
what it tastes like.

01:42:00.198 --> 01:42:03.076
I do want to know what it tastes like.

01:42:03.243 --> 01:42:04.995
But seeing as you're a good man,

01:42:05.162 --> 01:42:07.372
I know that you'd never put me
in a position

01:42:07.539 --> 01:42:09.458
that would compromise my honour.

01:42:17.799 --> 01:42:19.384
I'm proud of you, Jack.

01:42:20.010 --> 01:42:23.597
Land,ho!

01:42:28.018 --> 01:42:29.770
I want my jar of dirt.

01:42:31.313 --> 01:42:32.814
You're pulling too fast.

01:42:32.981 --> 01:42:36.276
You're pulling too slow.
We don't want the Kraken to catch us.

01:42:36.443 --> 01:42:39.446
I'm saving me strength
for when it comes.

01:42:39.613 --> 01:42:41.782
And I don't think it's Kraken, anyways.

01:42:41.948 --> 01:42:43.909
I always heard it said Krayken.

01:42:44.076 --> 01:42:45.661
What, with a long A?

01:42:45.827 --> 01:42:49.623
No, no, no. Krahken's how it's pronounced
in the original Scandinavian

01:42:49.790 --> 01:42:50.916
and Kraken's closer to that.

01:42:51.083 --> 01:42:54.586
Well, we ain't original Scandinavians,
are we?

01:42:54.753 --> 01:42:56.421
- Krayken.
- It's a mythological creature,

01:42:56.588 --> 01:42:57.756
I can calls it what I wants.

01:43:01.677 --> 01:43:06.098
Guard the boat, mind the tide.
Don't touch my dirt.

01:43:42.092 --> 01:43:43.093
This doesn't work.

01:43:43.552 --> 01:43:45.971
And it certainly doesn't show you
what you want most.

01:43:51.643 --> 01:43:53.311
Yes, it does.

01:43:53.478 --> 01:43:55.480
You're sitting on it.

01:43:55.814 --> 01:43:57.482
- Beg pardon?
- Move.

01:44:05.323 --> 01:44:07.868
- "Guard the boat. Mind the tide."
- I could join the circus.

01:44:08.034 --> 01:44:09.703
"Don't mind if I shine your shoes, sir."

01:44:14.207 --> 01:44:16.001
They're here.

01:44:16.293 --> 01:44:18.795
And I cannot step foot on land again
for near of a decade.

01:44:18.962 --> 01:44:20.464
You'll trust us to act in your stead?

01:44:21.089 --> 01:44:24.342
I'll trust you to know what awaits you
should you fail!

01:44:26.011 --> 01:44:27.345
Down, then!

01:44:27.512 --> 01:44:29.055
- Down!
- Down!

01:44:29.222 --> 01:44:31.391
Down!

01:45:38.750 --> 01:45:39.751
It's real.

01:45:41.753 --> 01:45:43.755
You actually were telling the truth.

01:45:43.922 --> 01:45:46.675
I do that quite a lot.
Yet people are always surprised.

01:45:47.551 --> 01:45:48.552
With good reason.

01:45:50.512 --> 01:45:52.097
Will.

01:45:53.139 --> 01:45:56.893
You're all right. Thank God.
I came to find you.

01:46:02.983 --> 01:46:04.276
How did you get here?

01:46:05.151 --> 01:46:06.903
Sea turtles, mate,

01:46:07.070 --> 01:46:09.030
a pair of them strapped to my feet.

01:46:09.197 --> 01:46:10.323
Not so easy, is it?

01:46:11.157 --> 01:46:13.743
- But I do owe you thanks, Jack.
- You do?

01:46:13.910 --> 01:46:17.956
After you tricked me onto that ship
to square your debt with Jones...

01:46:18.415 --> 01:46:20.083
- What?
- What?

01:46:20.750 --> 01:46:23.336
...I was reunited with my father.

01:46:23.503 --> 01:46:26.131
Oh, well, you're welcome, then.

01:46:26.715 --> 01:46:30.427
Everything you said to me,
every word was a lie!

01:46:30.594 --> 01:46:33.680
Pretty much. Time and tide, love.

01:46:36.099 --> 01:46:37.851
What are you doing?

01:46:38.018 --> 01:46:39.269
I'm gonna kill Jones.

01:46:41.354 --> 01:46:42.772
Can't let you do that, William.

01:46:43.773 --> 01:46:45.066
Because if Jones is dead,

01:46:45.901 --> 01:46:48.236
who's to call his terrible beastie
off the hunt, eh?

01:46:55.869 --> 01:46:59.122
Now, if you please.

01:46:59.831 --> 01:47:00.916
The key.

01:47:04.669 --> 01:47:07.130
I keep the promises I make, Jack.

01:47:07.297 --> 01:47:10.717
I intend to free my father.
I hope you're here to see it.

01:47:10.884 --> 01:47:13.011
I can't let you do that either.

01:47:13.178 --> 01:47:14.387
So sorry.

01:47:14.554 --> 01:47:17.057
I knew you'd warm up to me eventually.

01:47:18.892 --> 01:47:21.603
Lord Beckett desires the contents
of that chest.

01:47:23.063 --> 01:47:26.107
I deliver it, I get my life back.

01:47:27.692 --> 01:47:29.194
The dark side of ambition.

01:47:29.653 --> 01:47:33.073
Oh, I prefer to see it
as the promise of redemption.

01:47:37.494 --> 01:47:38.912
Stop it!

01:47:43.083 --> 01:47:44.751
Be careful!

01:47:45.627 --> 01:47:47.087
Will!

01:47:48.129 --> 01:47:51.091
- Guard the chest.
- No!

01:47:51.257 --> 01:47:53.635
This is barbaric!

01:47:53.802 --> 01:47:56.221
This is no way for grown men to settle--

01:47:56.388 --> 01:47:57.472
Oh, fine!

01:47:58.098 --> 01:48:01.851
Let's just pull out our swords
and start banging away at each other!

01:48:02.018 --> 01:48:03.520
That will solve everything!

01:48:03.687 --> 01:48:10.151
I've had it! I've had it with wobbly-legged,
rum-soaked pirates!

01:48:12.320 --> 01:48:13.989
And how'd this go all screwy?

01:48:14.155 --> 01:48:15.281
- Enough!
- Well,

01:48:15.448 --> 01:48:17.367
each wants the chest for hisself,
don%he?

01:48:17.534 --> 01:48:20.620
Mr. Norrington, I think,
he's trying regain a bit of honour.

01:48:20.787 --> 01:48:23.206
Old Jack's looking to trade it,
save his own skin.

01:48:23.373 --> 01:48:26.167
And Turner there,
I figure he's trying to settle

01:48:26.334 --> 01:48:31.047
some unresolved business 'twixt him
and his twice-cursed pirate father.

01:48:31.381 --> 01:48:33.174
- Sad.
- This is madness!

01:48:33.341 --> 01:48:35.885
That chest must be worth more
than a shiny penny.

01:48:36.052 --> 01:48:39.097
Oh, terrible temptation.

01:48:39.264 --> 01:48:45.270
If we was any kind of decent,
we'd remove temptation from their path.

01:48:50.984 --> 01:48:52.861
Enough!

01:48:57.532 --> 01:49:00.076
Oh, the heat!

01:49:20.597 --> 01:49:21.598
Bugger

01:49:35.070 --> 01:49:37.405
By your leave, Mr. Turner.

01:50:24.410 --> 01:50:25.912
By your leave, Mr. Norrington.

01:51:19.549 --> 01:51:22.427
Do excuse me while I kill the man
who ruined my life.

01:51:22.594 --> 01:51:23.595
Be my guest.

01:51:23.761 --> 01:51:26.598
Let us examine that claim for a moment,
former commodore, shall we?

01:51:27.140 --> 01:51:29.726
Who was it, that at the very moment

01:51:29.893 --> 01:51:32.520
you had a notorious pirate
safely behind bars,

01:51:32.687 --> 01:51:35.607
saw fit to free said pirate

01:51:35.773 --> 01:51:39.402
and take your dearly beloved
all to hisself, eh?

01:51:40.653 --> 01:51:43.072
So who's fault is it really

01:51:43.239 --> 01:51:47.535
that you've ended up a rum-pot deck hand
what takes orders from pirates?

01:51:47.702 --> 01:51:49.495
Enough!

01:51:52.040 --> 01:51:55.710
Unfortunately, Mr. Turner, he's right!

01:51:57.670 --> 01:51:59.589
Still rooting for you, mate.

01:52:57.897 --> 01:53:00.566
- We got it. We got it.
- We got it.

01:53:14.956 --> 01:53:16.624
Hello, poppet.

01:53:44.944 --> 01:53:46.738
Come on, run!

01:54:29.655 --> 01:54:31.574
- Sword!
- Sword! Sword!

01:54:34.494 --> 01:54:36.079
Sword!

01:55:17.787 --> 01:55:20.331
Follow my voice. Follow my voice.

01:55:20.498 --> 01:55:24.836
To the left. No, turn around.
Go to the right. Go--

01:55:25.002 --> 01:55:27.547
No, that's a tree.

01:55:27.713 --> 01:55:29.048
Oh, shut it.

01:55:50.862 --> 01:55:52.155
- It's over there.
- Jack!

01:55:56.075 --> 01:55:58.077
- You have it.
- Yeah.

01:56:18.681 --> 01:56:20.308
Jar of dirt.

01:57:20.785 --> 01:57:21.953
Right.

01:57:47.311 --> 01:57:49.855
- We'll hang on to that.
- Come on.

01:57:56.320 --> 01:57:58.239
We've got it.

01:58:00.741 --> 01:58:02.285
All right.

01:58:08.291 --> 01:58:09.542
Come along, Turner!

01:58:27.351 --> 01:58:30.438
Leave him alone! Unless you plan
on using him to hit something with.

01:58:32.148 --> 01:58:35.651
- We're not getting out of this.
- Not with the chest. Into the boat.

01:58:37.320 --> 01:58:39.280
- You're mad.
- Don't wait for me.

01:58:46.329 --> 01:58:50.041
- I say we respect his final wish.
- Aye!

01:58:59.467 --> 01:59:01.927
Your bravery is wasted.

01:59:03.387 --> 01:59:08.476
I shall pry the chest away
from your cold, dead hands.

01:59:11.687 --> 01:59:13.356
Here you go.

01:59:25.201 --> 01:59:26.869
Pirates.

01:59:34.919 --> 01:59:36.379
H9)'-

01:59:45.012 --> 01:59:46.055
What happened to the chest?

01:59:46.514 --> 01:59:48.432
Norrington took it to draw them off.

01:59:48.891 --> 01:59:50.101
You're pulling too hard!

01:59:50.267 --> 01:59:52.103
You ain't pulling hard enough!

01:59:52.561 --> 01:59:55.272
- Where's the commodore?
- Fell behind.

01:59:55.773 --> 01:59:57.858
My prayers be with him.

01:59:58.025 --> 01:59:59.402
Best not wallow in our grief.

02:00:00.069 --> 02:00:05.616
The bright side is you're back
and made it off free and clear.

02:00:20.381 --> 02:00:22.591
Lord on high, deliver us.

02:00:25.970 --> 02:00:27.638
I'll handle this, mate.

02:00:30.558 --> 02:00:31.600
Fish face.

02:00:33.185 --> 02:00:35.646
Lose something? Hey, scungilli.

02:00:40.985 --> 02:00:42.611
Got it.

02:00:44.196 --> 02:00:47.158
Come to negotiate, eh,
have you, you slimy git?

02:00:47.324 --> 02:00:48.743
Look what I got.

02:00:48.909 --> 02:00:51.954
<i>I got a jar of dirt
I got a jar of dirt</i>

02:00:52.121 --> 02:00:53.873
<i>And guess what's inside it</i>

02:00:54.915 --> 02:00:56.292
Enough.

02:01:04.508 --> 02:01:05.634
Hard to starboard.

02:01:05.801 --> 02:01:08.679
- Hard to starboard!
- Brace up the foreyard!

02:01:13.517 --> 02:01:15.561
Hard to starboard!

02:01:15.728 --> 02:01:19.273
Send his beloved <i>Pearl</i>
back to the depths.

02:01:19.440 --> 02:01:20.566
Fire!

02:01:32.745 --> 02:01:36.499
She's on us! She's on us!

02:01:38.167 --> 02:01:42.171
- Let them taste the triple guns.
- Aye, captain.

02:02:08.155 --> 02:02:09.573
Make fast!

02:02:10.866 --> 02:02:13.410
Go on, me darling.
Show us what you've got.

02:02:13.577 --> 02:02:16.747
Come on, girl!

02:02:22.378 --> 02:02:24.547
- She's falling behind.
- Aye, we've got her.

02:02:24.713 --> 02:02:25.714
We're the faster?

02:02:25.881 --> 02:02:28.634
Against the wind the Dutchman beats us,
that's how she takes her prey.

02:02:28.801 --> 02:02:32.012
- But with the wind...
- We rob her advantage.

02:02:35.099 --> 02:02:36.559
They're out of range!

02:02:36.725 --> 02:02:41.272
Break off pursuit, run out light
and douse canvas.

02:02:41.438 --> 02:02:43.357
We giving up, sir?

02:02:53.909 --> 02:02:56.120
They're giving up!

02:03:02.251 --> 02:03:04.253
My father is on that ship.

02:03:04.420 --> 02:03:06.922
If we can outrun her, we can take her.
We should turn and fight.

02:03:07.089 --> 02:03:09.633
Why fight when you can negotiate?

02:03:09.800 --> 02:03:13.929
All one needs is the proper leverage.

02:03:24.064 --> 02:03:27.318
Where is it?
Where is the thump-thump?

02:03:28.277 --> 02:03:29.445
We must have hit the reef!

02:03:33.365 --> 02:03:35.826
No. It's not a reef!

02:03:36.327 --> 02:03:37.453
Get away from the rail!

02:03:37.620 --> 02:03:39.204
- What is it?
- The Kraken.

02:03:40.581 --> 02:03:43.083
- To arms!
- All guns, defend the masts!

02:03:43.250 --> 02:03:45.210
It'll attack the starboard.
I've seen it before!

02:03:45.669 --> 02:03:47.588
Run out the cannons
and hold for my signal.

02:03:53.552 --> 02:03:55.596
Come on! Come on!

02:04:21.246 --> 02:04:23.624
Ea$V,boys!

02:04:27.044 --> 02:04:28.045
Will?

02:04:28.671 --> 02:04:30.756
Steady. Steady.

02:04:32.800 --> 02:04:36.136
- Will?
- Hold. Hold.

02:04:36.303 --> 02:04:39.264
I think we've held fire long enough.

02:04:40.057 --> 02:04:42.851
- Will?
- Fire!

02:04:47.022 --> 02:04:48.273
No!

02:05:03.038 --> 02:05:05.082
It'll be back.
We have to get off the ship.

02:05:05.249 --> 02:05:06.500
There's no boats.

02:05:14.842 --> 02:05:19.304
Pull the grates. Get all the gunpowder
onto the net in the cargo hold!

02:05:21.682 --> 02:05:23.100
Whatever you do, don't miss.

02:05:23.600 --> 02:05:25.561
As soon as you're clear.

02:05:40.367 --> 02:05:42.661
We are short stocked on gunpowder.

02:05:42.828 --> 02:05:44.997
Six barrel.

02:05:45.497 --> 02:05:47.249
Hurry UP!

02:05:47.666 --> 02:05:49.460
There's only half a dozen
kegs of powder.

02:05:49.626 --> 02:05:51.211
Then load the rum.

02:06:00.179 --> 02:06:02.931
Aye, the rum too!

02:06:31.168 --> 02:06:32.961
Step to.

02:06:36.840 --> 02:06:39.134
Oh, you coward.

02:06:44.139 --> 02:06:45.182
Not good.

02:06:54.274 --> 02:06:56.860
- Haul away!
- Heave!

02:06:57.027 --> 02:06:59.154
Heave like you're being paid for it!

02:06:59.321 --> 02:07:01.323
Put your backs into it!

02:07:01.490 --> 02:07:04.701
- Pull it away!
- Come on, you can do it!

02:07:44.491 --> 02:07:46.702
I got you! I got you!

02:07:46.869 --> 02:07:48.745
- Don't let me go!
- I won't let you go!

02:07:49.246 --> 02:07:50.372
Shoot me!

02:07:55.794 --> 02:07:58.714
- Here!
- Here! Come on!

02:08:15.689 --> 02:08:17.733
Here! Come on!

02:08:18.442 --> 02:08:21.028
Come and get me. I'm over here!

02:08:21.195 --> 02:08:22.196
Come on!

02:08:48.055 --> 02:08:49.723
Shoot!

02:08:49.890 --> 02:08:51.308
Elizabeth, shoot!

02:10:18.770 --> 02:10:20.605
Did We kill it?

02:10:20.772 --> 02:10:24.234
No. We just made it angry.

02:10:24.651 --> 02:10:27.529
We're not out of this yet.
Captain, orders!

02:10:29.656 --> 02:10:32.617
Abandon ship. Into the longboat.

02:10:34.619 --> 02:10:36.121
Jack.

02:10:36.288 --> 02:10:38.248
<i>The Pearl.</i>

02:10:38.665 --> 02:10:40.334
She's only a ship, mate.

02:10:41.168 --> 02:10:42.794
He's right. We have to head for land.

02:10:43.795 --> 02:10:46.757
- It's a lot of open water.
- It's a lot of water.

02:10:46.923 --> 02:10:48.508
We have to try.

02:10:49.426 --> 02:10:51.511
We can get away
as it takes down the Pearl.

02:10:53.513 --> 02:10:55.223
Abandon ship.

02:10:55.390 --> 02:10:58.310
Abandon ship or abandon hope.

02:11:14.534 --> 02:11:16.411
Thank you, Jack.

02:11:18.872 --> 02:11:20.332
We're not free yet, love.

02:11:21.625 --> 02:11:23.585
You came back.

02:11:26.421 --> 02:11:29.007
I always knew you were a good man.

02:11:42.104 --> 02:11:44.856
Prepare to cast off.
There's no time to lose.

02:11:45.023 --> 02:11:47.317
Come on, Will. Step to!

02:12:06.503 --> 02:12:08.880
It's after you, not the ship.

02:12:09.047 --> 02:12:10.841
It's not us.

02:12:12.050 --> 02:12:14.636
This is the only way, don't you see?

02:12:18.140 --> 02:12:20.142
I'm not sorry.

02:12:25.897 --> 02:12:27.732
Pirate.

02:12:47.252 --> 02:12:48.920
Where's Jack?

02:12:52.340 --> 02:12:55.093
He elected to stay behind
to give us a chance.

02:13:05.687 --> 02:13:07.230
Go!

02:13:21.036 --> 02:13:22.579
Bugger, bugger, bugger!

02:13:51.983 --> 02:13:53.026
Come on.

02:13:58.281 --> 02:13:59.991
Just got it. Come on.

02:14:30.230 --> 02:14:31.565
Not so bad.

02:14:43.994 --> 02:14:45.704
Hello, beastie.

02:15:34.628 --> 02:15:38.757
Jack Sparrow, our debt is settled.

02:15:40.008 --> 02:15:42.302
The captain goes down with the ship.

02:15:42.469 --> 02:15:46.348
Turns out not even Jack Sparrow
can best the devil.

02:15:51.895 --> 02:15:52.937
Open the chest.

02:15:55.565 --> 02:15:58.026
Open the chest. I need to see it!

02:16:13.458 --> 02:16:20.465
Damn you, Jack Sparrow!

02:16:25.470 --> 02:16:28.139
The last of our ships is returned.

02:16:28.306 --> 02:16:31.393
- Is there any news on the chest?
- None.

02:16:31.559 --> 02:16:36.189
But one of the ships
did pick up a man adrift at sea.

02:16:36.522 --> 02:16:38.483
He had these.

02:16:45.740 --> 02:16:49.201
I took the liberty of filling in my name.

02:16:56.376 --> 02:16:59.879
If you intend to claim these,
then you must have something to trade.

02:17:00.504 --> 02:17:02.549
Do you have the compass?

02:17:03.216 --> 02:17:04.718
Better.

02:17:12.267 --> 02:17:14.727
The heart of Davy Jones.

02:18:10.241 --> 02:18:14.954
Against the cold and the sorrow.

02:18:25.380 --> 02:18:27.549
It's a shame.

02:18:28.009 --> 02:18:30.428
I know you're thinking
that with the <i>Pearl</i>

02:18:30.594 --> 02:18:35.016
you could have captured the devil
and set free your father's soul.

02:18:36.058 --> 02:18:38.061
Doesn't matter now.

02:18:38.852 --> 02:18:43.483
The <i>Pearl</i> is gone,
along with its captain.

02:18:43.650 --> 02:18:45.235
Aye.

02:18:45.943 --> 02:18:49.823
And already the world
seems a bit less bright.

02:18:49.989 --> 02:18:52.909
He fooled us all right till the end,

02:18:53.159 --> 02:18:57.038
but I guess that honest streak
finally won out.

02:18:59.749 --> 02:19:01.459
To Jack Sparrow.

02:19:01.626 --> 02:19:04.212
Never another like Captain Jack.

02:19:04.379 --> 02:19:06.505
He was a gentleman of fortune, he was.

02:19:07.215 --> 02:19:09.174
He was a good man.

02:19:29.987 --> 02:19:33.407
If there was anything could be done
to bring him back...

02:19:35.368 --> 02:19:38.079
- Elizabeth.
- Would you do it?

02:19:40.373 --> 02:19:42.625
What would you?

02:19:46.170 --> 02:19:49.299
What would any of you be willing to do?

02:19:51.259 --> 02:19:55.096
Would you sail to the ends of the Earth
and beyond

02:19:55.263 --> 02:20:00.268
to fetch back witty Jack
and him precious <i>Pearl?</i>

02:20:06.566 --> 02:20:07.650
Aye.

02:20:08.818 --> 02:20:10.069
Aye.

02:20:10.778 --> 02:20:11.905
Aye.

02:20:13.281 --> 02:20:14.282
Aye.

02:20:17.285 --> 02:20:18.828
Yes.

02:20:21.664 --> 02:20:23.041
Aye.

02:20:23.207 --> 02:20:25.293
All right.

02:20:26.127 --> 02:20:33.051
But if you go and brave the weird
and haunted shores at world's end

02:20:34.218 --> 02:20:40.975
then you will need a captain
who knows those waters.

02:20:55.406 --> 02:20:59.994
So tell me, what's become of my ship?
