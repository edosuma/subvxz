00:14.205 --> 00:16.525
When did you... first notice it?

00:17.045 --> 00:19.245
Ah, well, the pipe started leaking

00:19.325 --> 00:21.405
and the wallpaper started to get wet,

00:21.485 --> 00:23.005
and then it started to form this image.

00:25.405 --> 00:27.045
And when did you think, "Oh...

00:27.325 --> 00:29.125
that looks a bit like
Sir Kenneth Branagh"?

00:29.725 --> 00:33.405
Oh, well, it was when the shading started
to form around this bit here.

00:33.485 --> 00:35.245
And, well, it's got his mouth, hasn't it?

00:36.125 --> 00:37.725
-Just a line.
-[man] Yeah.

00:37.805 --> 00:39.805
It's amazing, innit? Makes you think.

00:40.565 --> 00:41.405
Yeah.

00:43.885 --> 00:45.045
-Take a picture.
-[Lenny] Yeah.

00:46.445 --> 00:47.365
[Lenny] There you go.

00:47.445 --> 00:48.805
[man] Er... Okay?

00:49.245 --> 00:50.405
-Yeah.

00:50.485 --> 00:52.445
-This'll cheer the wife up no end.
-[Tony] Will it?

00:52.525 --> 00:54.285
-[man] Been a bit down lately.
-Aw!

00:54.365 --> 00:57.045
-Got hit in the head with a hammer.
-She got hit in the head with a hammer?

00:57.125 --> 01:00.885
Two blokes on a moped grabbed her handbag,
hit her on the head and she let go.

01:00.965 --> 01:04.125
And the police don't like to chase 'em
because the kids take their helmets off,

01:04.205 --> 01:07.565
and then it's dangerous,
and the police might get sued, so...

01:08.085 --> 01:09.565
-PC gone mad, innit?
-[camera clicks]

01:10.045 --> 01:10.885
Yep.

01:16.405 --> 01:20.205
So... his wife gets mugged
by a motorcycle gang,

01:21.125 --> 01:22.485
hit in the head with a hammer,

01:22.565 --> 01:26.325
he goes home, sees a stain
that looks a bit like Sir Kenneth Branagh,

01:26.645 --> 01:29.005
and <i>that's</i> what he calls
the local paper about.

01:29.885 --> 01:32.085
Also, any stain
looks like Kenneth Branagh.

01:32.525 --> 01:34.285
He's got no distinguishing features.

01:34.365 --> 01:36.365
You couldn't do a caricature of him

01:36.445 --> 01:39.125
'cause there's no features to exaggerate.

01:39.205 --> 01:43.285
He's just got a face: a vague, beige face.

01:43.365 --> 01:45.445
If I was him, I'd wear glasses,

01:45.525 --> 01:46.605
big, red glasses.

01:46.685 --> 01:48.445
So when people said,
"Who's Kenneth Branagh?"

01:48.525 --> 01:50.005
"You know, big, red glasses."

01:50.085 --> 01:51.205
"Oh!"

01:51.285 --> 01:53.845
I think he's quite handsome.
I'd love to look like Kenneth Branagh.

01:53.925 --> 01:56.645
Course you would.
'Cause you look like fuckin' Shrek.

01:57.125 --> 01:59.885
Be an upgrade for you.
At least you'd be human, then.

02:00.365 --> 02:01.405
Birds love it.

02:01.485 --> 02:04.685
Talking of birds, I went on a date
with the fat kid's mum the other night.

02:04.765 --> 02:06.405
I'll see you back at the office.

02:08.285 --> 02:11.685

and then, you know... What you gonna...

-Okay, calm down.

02:14.365 --> 02:16.685
-Who the fuck are you?
-I'll be whoever you want me to be.

02:16.885 --> 02:18.805
You spent my 60 quid on a prostitute?

02:18.885 --> 02:21.565
-No, she's a friend of mine.
-I'm not gonna charge him 60 quid, am I?

02:22.205 --> 02:24.565
And less of the prostitute.
I'm a sex worker.

02:25.045 --> 02:26.005
Oh, my bad.

02:26.565 --> 02:28.645
-Gimme my money!
-Be careful with him.

02:28.725 --> 02:30.485
Sorry, shouldn't you be
wanking someone off?

02:30.565 --> 02:32.525
My next appointment's
not till three o'clock.

02:32.925 --> 02:34.885
What'd you do with the money?
As if I didn't know.

02:34.965 --> 02:37.125
-Bought some drugs.
-Bought some drugs. They're my drugs.

02:37.285 --> 02:38.245
We could share them.

02:38.325 --> 02:39.965
Why would we share them? They're mine.

02:40.045 --> 02:40.925
What did you buy?

02:41.005 --> 02:42.925
-Um, smack, a bit of hash.
-Right.

02:44.205 --> 02:45.885
I'll have the hash. Keep the smack.

02:45.965 --> 02:48.525
-Aw!
-I haven't got it on me, have I?

02:48.605 --> 02:50.765
-I could bring it over later, though.
-Right.

02:52.925 --> 02:53.805
Do you live here?

02:54.325 --> 02:55.165
Er...

02:55.485 --> 02:56.325
Yeah.

02:57.445 --> 02:58.285
Why?

02:59.045 --> 03:01.045
I got kicked out
of the last garage, didn't I?

03:01.605 --> 03:03.365
I don't mean why do you live in
this garage.

03:03.445 --> 03:04.885
Why do you live in a garage at all?

03:04.965 --> 03:08.205
Oh, this happens. People like you
just don't see it from your ivory tower.

His girlfriend died.

03:19.125 --> 03:20.245
He had a girlfriend?

but maybe it's just because you're a cunt.

09:33.885 --> 09:35.885
[door opens and closes]

09:40.045 --> 09:41.445
[sighing] That went well.

09:43.125 --> 09:44.925
Cunt. [chuckles]

09:46.605 --> 09:47.445
Cunt.

09:48.405 --> 09:49.245
Yep.

09:51.525 --> 09:52.805
[Tony] I couldn't believe it.

09:52.885 --> 09:56.445
I mean, she's a nurse looking after
my dad, who's got Alzheimer's,

09:56.885 --> 09:59.925
and then she's giving me grief
for getting upset about stuff.

10:00.685 --> 10:02.925
-I wouldn't worry about it.
-No, I know.

10:04.045 --> 10:06.045
-But you do.
-Yeah.

10:08.085 --> 10:09.325
'Cause you know she's right.

10:10.125 --> 10:11.125
No. What?

10:12.765 --> 10:15.045
Unbelievable. Stan, what d'you reckon?

10:15.125 --> 10:17.045
D'you think the women
are ganging up on me?

10:17.325 --> 10:18.365
He agrees with me.

10:18.765 --> 10:20.685
-There's a surprise.
-Apologize to her.

10:21.405 --> 10:22.965
-For what?
-It doesn't matter.

10:23.605 --> 10:26.045
It shows strength, not weakness. Trust me.

10:26.645 --> 10:29.045
I can't just go and apologize for nothing.

10:29.125 --> 10:31.245
But it wouldn't be for nothing, would it?

10:31.325 --> 10:35.845
You'd be apologizing for arguing
with someone you like, someone who's nice.

10:37.965 --> 10:39.205
She's nice, right?

10:40.725 --> 10:44.405
-She's--
-There you are. Ahhh!

10:44.485 --> 10:46.085
-What?
-[laughs]

10:46.725 --> 10:48.525
Thought so. [chuckles]

10:49.165 --> 10:52.285
Well, why don't you look at it
as your first lovers' tiff?

10:52.365 --> 10:53.525
That's ridiculous.

10:54.125 --> 10:55.645
Okay, good. Well done.

10:56.525 --> 10:58.325
Right, I'll see you later.

10:59.245 --> 11:01.365
-See you later, Stan.
-[Anne chuckles]

11:01.445 --> 11:03.445
[mellow guitar music]

11:03.805 --> 11:04.845
[chuckles]

11:04.925 --> 11:06.925
[children playing and shouting]

11:21.245 --> 11:22.245
Good week?

11:22.325 --> 11:23.285
No, course not.

11:23.885 --> 11:25.565
How could I possibly have had a good week?

11:26.005 --> 11:27.325
Only you know that, really.

11:27.405 --> 11:28.725
Why am I paying you, then?

11:29.645 --> 11:30.925
That's a good question.

11:31.005 --> 11:32.645
[clock ticking]

11:32.725 --> 11:33.565
And?

11:33.845 --> 11:35.285
Well, why are you paying me?

11:35.365 --> 11:38.005
What, so I've got to know that... too?

11:38.885 --> 11:44.085
Tony, we're here to ask <i>and</i> answer
difficult questions about yourself.

11:45.005 --> 11:47.205
Now, maybe you don't wanna know
the answer.

11:47.285 --> 11:50.365
Maybe the easy way out for you
is to think that there <i>isn't </i>an answer.

11:50.565 --> 11:53.325
Well, there is an answer, but you seem...

11:54.405 --> 11:57.325
happier to just accept your unhappiness.

11:57.405 --> 12:00.365
No, I do accept my unhappiness.
I know exactly why I'm unhappy,

12:00.445 --> 12:03.085
and I also know the only thing
that would stop me being unhappy

12:03.165 --> 12:04.285
is impossible.

12:04.365 --> 12:07.885
What I don't know is why I pay someone
who doesn't care about me.

12:07.965 --> 12:09.005
Well...

12:09.085 --> 12:11.725
there are people in your life
who <i>care</i> about you,

12:11.805 --> 12:14.285
but do they actually do
what's good for you?

12:14.845 --> 12:17.245
I don't think anyone knows
what's good for me.

12:17.325 --> 12:18.805
Well, I think it's in there somewhere.

12:18.885 --> 12:21.725
I just wanna stop feeling sad.

12:24.325 --> 12:25.165
Do that, then.

12:25.885 --> 12:28.165
Just... stop feeling sad.

12:30.565 --> 12:31.605
[snorts]

12:35.925 --> 12:39.165
[Tony] So, I make some notes at the time,

12:39.245 --> 12:42.085
if I can be bothered and stay awake.

12:43.205 --> 12:46.005
I get the gist of it: their name and age,

12:46.405 --> 12:48.525
what street they live in.
People love that.

12:48.845 --> 12:50.245
And then I try and make...

12:50.645 --> 12:54.125
the fucking banal seem mildly interesting.

12:54.725 --> 12:57.365
Um, this guy, his pipes leaked,

12:57.445 --> 12:59.965
and a stain appeared on his wallpaper

13:00.285 --> 13:02.885
that he said looks like Kenneth Branagh.

13:04.325 --> 13:06.125
-Do you know who that is?
-No.

13:06.645 --> 13:08.165
He's an old actor, director.

13:08.805 --> 13:09.645
Um...

13:09.765 --> 13:11.725
-Have you heard of Emma Thompson?
-Yeah.

13:13.005 --> 13:15.565
He'd hate that. Um, anyway,

13:16.285 --> 13:18.165
it was a stain on a wall.

13:18.565 --> 13:20.005
Have you got the photos from the...

13:20.485 --> 13:22.925
Oh, yeah. Talking of photos,

13:23.365 --> 13:26.925
I've got some pictures of the date I had
with the fat kid's mum the other--

13:27.005 --> 13:28.365
[Braden] Everyone, listen up.

13:28.445 --> 13:29.285
Um...

13:29.605 --> 13:30.485
Work's outing.

13:30.925 --> 13:31.765
No.

13:32.245 --> 13:33.205
Yeah.

13:33.285 --> 13:34.125
Yes.

13:34.405 --> 13:35.965
It's gonna be good for team-building.

13:36.045 --> 13:38.965
There's a new comedy club in town,
just opened. They're advertising with us,

13:39.045 --> 13:41.445
so I thought show willing,
bought us all tickets.

13:41.525 --> 13:43.165
[Kath]
I said I could have got 'em for free.

13:43.245 --> 13:45.165
Yeah, I know,
but you've gotta support the arts.

13:45.245 --> 13:47.805
It's good. All proper comedians.

13:48.765 --> 13:49.805
There is a woman on.

13:53.405 --> 13:54.245
Right?

13:54.765 --> 13:57.405
Well, I'm just saying.
Just checking you're all right.

14:00.725 --> 14:03.045
Good. So, yeah, come. It'll be fun.

14:03.125 --> 14:05.685
-It won't. [sighs]
-Tony, it will. Give it a chance.

14:06.925 --> 14:09.605
Talking of fun, I had a lot of fun
on that date the other night with--

14:09.685 --> 14:11.685
-[woman] Tony.
-[Tony, sighing] Ohh.

14:11.765 --> 14:13.325
-Who's that?
-Local nutter.

14:14.605 --> 14:16.605
Always trying to get in the paper,
ain't you, Brian?

14:16.845 --> 14:17.685
She's new.

14:18.605 --> 14:19.725
-[Tony] Yep.
-[Brian] Mmm!

14:19.805 --> 14:22.925
-[Tony exhales] You stink.
-Never mind that.

14:23.125 --> 14:24.885
Got something for your front cover,

14:25.165 --> 14:26.445
-if you're interested.
-No.

14:27.165 --> 14:28.365
Freddie Mercury's tooth.

14:29.085 --> 14:31.565
-Where d'you get that?
-Up the park, by the swings.

14:31.645 --> 14:33.005
And what makes you think it's his?

14:34.005 --> 14:35.565
[snickers] Look at the size of it, mate.

14:35.645 --> 14:37.445
-[laughs softly]
-He's disgusting.

14:37.525 --> 14:39.965
Huh? Why don't you stick a knob
down your throat, blabbermouth?

14:40.045 --> 14:41.845
Why do you want to be in the paper, Brian?

14:41.925 --> 14:44.445
'Cause I want to show the world
what I've got, what I can do,

14:44.645 --> 14:45.605
what diseases I've had.

14:45.845 --> 14:48.405
-No one's interested in your diseases.
-Oh, aren't they?

14:48.485 --> 14:49.565
-[Tony] No.
-Sexual exploits?

14:49.645 --> 14:50.485
-No.
-No?

14:50.965 --> 14:52.965
-I'm a member of a swingers' club.
-[Tony] Urgh.

14:53.045 --> 14:55.245
You know the assistant manager
of Tambury FC?

14:55.325 --> 14:56.525
I've given him a blowjob.

14:56.605 --> 14:58.765
Stick <i>that </i>on your sports page.

14:58.845 --> 15:00.845
[Tony] We're not gonna put it
on the sports page.

15:00.925 --> 15:03.605
It's not Freddie Mercury's tooth.
We're not gonna put your diseases...

15:03.685 --> 15:06.565
This is a local paper about old ladies,
their big fat cat,

15:06.645 --> 15:09.205
or someone finding a hat in a tree.
We're not gonna go with,

15:09.285 --> 15:11.365
"Oh, here's Brian Gittens,
local man done proud,

15:11.445 --> 15:14.445
sucking off some fuckin' nonce
at the football." Think!

15:15.645 --> 15:16.805
Have you got a jokes page?

15:16.885 --> 15:18.445
-No.
-Then you're missing a trick

15:18.525 --> 15:20.485
'cause I write my own jokes.
D'you wanna hear one?

15:21.805 --> 15:25.485
What do you get if you cross
a disabled octopus with my ex-wife?

15:26.845 --> 15:28.045
A five-legged <i>slut.</i>

15:30.125 --> 15:32.125
Brian, not everyone can get in the paper.

15:32.205 --> 15:34.085
Not everyone's fingered Jackie Collins.

15:34.165 --> 15:35.405
-Have you?
-No.

15:36.645 --> 15:38.565
When's that bothered the press before?
[snickers]

15:39.365 --> 15:40.245
Am I right?

15:40.685 --> 15:43.085
Brilliant. Okay, cheers.

15:43.165 --> 15:44.285
-[Brian] Okay.
-See you again.

15:49.605 --> 15:50.445
[Tony sighs]

15:56.885 --> 15:58.165
I've got a good feature for you.

15:59.605 --> 16:01.125
-No, you haven't.
-[Kath] Rude.

16:01.205 --> 16:03.045
-You haven't even heard it yet.
-[Tony] No need.

16:04.005 --> 16:05.325
-Crystals.
-Told you.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.205
Their healing power.

16:07.285 --> 16:08.885
[laughs] They're bullshit.

16:09.245 --> 16:11.125
-You're so narrow-minded.
-No.

16:11.205 --> 16:13.005
-You don't believe in anything.
-Yes, I do.

16:13.085 --> 16:14.285
Thought you were atheist.

16:14.365 --> 16:17.485
Doesn't mean I don't believe in anything.
It means I don't believe in any god.

16:17.565 --> 16:19.725
-How can you not believe in God?
-Which one?

16:21.005 --> 16:22.005
What do you mean?

16:22.365 --> 16:24.525
Well, er, Zeus?

16:25.405 --> 16:27.085
-Who?
-Greek god.

16:27.165 --> 16:28.725
Or Ra, or Ganesh?

16:28.805 --> 16:31.005
No, not those ones,
the real one in the Bible.

16:31.085 --> 16:32.085
Yahweh.

16:32.165 --> 16:33.125
Just God!

16:33.205 --> 16:36.925
Well, you know how you don't believe
in all those other gods I mentioned?

16:37.125 --> 16:39.085
That's how I don't believe in yours.

16:39.165 --> 16:41.685
How can you not believe
that someone created all this, though?

16:42.085 --> 16:44.645
Why do you believe
that <i>someone</i> created it all?

16:44.725 --> 16:46.005
Because it's so good.

16:46.405 --> 16:48.045
It can't just be chance, can it?

16:49.365 --> 16:50.565
What, the Big Bang?

16:50.645 --> 16:53.245
Everything came from nothing?
That's impossible.

16:53.325 --> 16:54.925
You're right. God did it.

16:55.485 --> 16:56.325
Right.

16:56.805 --> 16:58.325
So, where did God come from?

17:01.045 --> 17:02.045
He's always been around.

17:02.805 --> 17:04.125
There you go. Easy, innit?

17:04.485 --> 17:05.365
[Kath] Mm.

17:10.885 --> 17:13.925
[Lisa] <i>You always found so much joy</i>
<i>in everything, all the little things.</i>

17:14.325 --> 17:16.285
<i>Sitting on the sofa with the dog.</i>
[chuckles]

17:16.645 --> 17:18.085
<i>With that look on your face, like,</i>

17:18.165 --> 17:20.445
<i>"I'm just sat on the sofa with the dog.</i>
<i>I'm loving it."</i>

17:22.165 --> 17:23.525
<i>Give the dog a kiss from me,</i>

17:24.565 --> 17:26.845
<i>and take her to the beach.</i>
<i>She loves it there.</i>

17:27.645 --> 17:29.045
<i>-You both do.</i>
-[Tony sighs]

17:31.205 --> 17:32.765
Do you wanna go to the beach?

17:33.325 --> 17:34.165
Yeah?

17:35.125 --> 17:36.325
Come on, then.

17:40.525 --> 17:42.565
Come on. Good girl.

19:01.285 --> 19:03.645
[shrieking]

19:03.725 --> 19:07.325
-Oh, my God! What did you do that for?
-[Brandy barking and whining]

19:07.405 --> 19:08.285
[Tony] You looked hot!

19:08.365 --> 19:11.325
-I was asleep! I'm soaked!
-[Tony chuckling]

19:11.405 --> 19:13.965
-Look, you've freaked the dog out.
-[Tony laughing]

19:14.045 --> 19:16.965
-Oh, you're such a twat!
-[Tony laughing]

19:17.045 --> 19:19.445
Oh, I might as well go in the sea now.

19:19.525 --> 19:22.525
Come on, boy! You come in the sea
with me! You come in.

19:22.845 --> 19:24.805
-[Tony] No.
-You come in. Tony, come in!

19:24.885 --> 19:26.445
-[Tony] No.
-Come on!

19:27.005 --> 19:27.845
Come on!

19:28.325 --> 19:29.645
<i>Come in, Tony!</i>

19:43.885 --> 19:44.725
[barks]

20:02.965 --> 20:03.925
[whines]

20:25.085 --> 20:26.965
[audience laughing]

20:27.045 --> 20:28.645
That's why they call them sports socks!

20:28.725 --> 20:29.765
[laughter]

20:29.845 --> 20:32.165
Thank you. You're a wonderful crowd,
you really are.

20:32.245 --> 20:33.645
I'm glad you're a wonderful crowd.

20:34.205 --> 20:36.325
I've had some bad news this week,
I have to say.

20:36.405 --> 20:38.325
-[crowd] Aw!
-Come on, sadder than that.

20:38.405 --> 20:39.325
[crowd, louder] Aw!

20:39.405 --> 20:41.445
Yeah, it was.

20:41.645 --> 20:43.885
A friend of mine
actually committed suicide last week.

20:44.365 --> 20:47.645
Yeah, went upstairs, swallowed everything
in the bathroom cabinet.

20:48.085 --> 20:49.285
Choked on a tampon.

20:49.365 --> 20:51.245
-[audience laughs]
-Oh, yeah.

20:51.885 --> 20:52.725
[snorts]

20:53.205 --> 20:54.965
Choked on a tampon. [laughs]

20:55.565 --> 20:58.845
So you've got this guy,
absolutely fucking hated that joke.

20:58.925 --> 21:01.925
I tell ya, his face fell like my nan.
Oh, no!

21:02.565 --> 21:04.605
Fucking cheer up, mate.
Might not ever happen.

21:04.685 --> 21:08.445
Come on. Instead of going,
"I'm not gonna laugh at this." Come on.

21:08.525 --> 21:09.765
What's your name then, man?

21:11.365 --> 21:12.405
What's your name?

21:13.205 --> 21:15.325
-Tony.
-Tony. There we go. Not so hard.

21:15.405 --> 21:16.645
What's your story, Tony?

21:18.165 --> 21:20.125
-What's my story?
-Yeah.

21:20.365 --> 21:22.405
Sitting here, front row.
What's your story?

21:24.325 --> 21:25.365
My wife died...

21:25.925 --> 21:26.845
earlier this year.

21:27.845 --> 21:28.685
Breast cancer.

21:30.725 --> 21:31.805
And it broke me.

21:33.485 --> 21:35.165
Not a day goes by when I don't...

21:36.245 --> 21:37.485
think of killing myself.

21:37.925 --> 21:40.765
I just don't see any point in living.

21:46.485 --> 21:47.405
Well...

21:52.365 --> 21:55.325
[nervously] Umbrellas are weird,
aren't they? Do you ever...

21:56.125 --> 21:57.285
As if an umbrella...

21:58.165 --> 21:59.005
[Tony] He asked.

21:59.885 --> 22:00.765
[Braden] Yeah.

22:00.965 --> 22:03.565
[Tony] He did. He asked me a question,
so I told him the truth.

22:05.565 --> 22:07.605
-[Braden] The truth's important to you.
-Yeah.

22:07.685 --> 22:10.765
Okay, well, here's the truth
for you, Tony. I'm tired, mate.

22:11.445 --> 22:14.765
Okay, I'm tired of spending my working day
worrying about you

22:14.845 --> 22:16.605
and about what you're gonna do next,

22:16.685 --> 22:19.445
and trying to come up with reasons
you shouldn't kill yourself,

22:19.805 --> 22:23.245
and finding tickets for things
to try and cheer you up.

22:23.845 --> 22:27.045
Okay? Midweek, as well, when I should be
home with my wife and son,

22:27.125 --> 22:28.525
dealing with my own problems.

22:28.925 --> 22:32.885
Right. So he's allowed to joke
about suicide, but I'm not allowed to--

22:32.965 --> 22:35.805
It wasn't about you, though, Tony.
The joke wasn't about you.

22:35.885 --> 22:37.565
It didn't happen. He made it up.

22:38.005 --> 22:41.925
His friend didn't really commit suicide
by choking on a tampon, obviously.

22:42.005 --> 22:44.445
-No, I get that.
-I mean, he doesn't know your situation.

22:44.525 --> 22:45.365
[Tony] Well...

22:45.445 --> 22:46.565
He doesn't. If he'd said,

22:46.965 --> 22:50.605
"Hands up, anyone whose wife has died
and is thinking about killing themselves,"

22:50.685 --> 22:53.325
you go, "Over here." He's like,
"Okay, mate, here's a joke for you."

22:53.405 --> 22:55.285
Right. Well, maybe I wasn't in the mood.

22:55.365 --> 22:56.205
[Braden] Great.

22:56.285 --> 22:58.085
He was trying to make people laugh.

23:00.485 --> 23:01.885
That's all I'm doing here, okay?

23:01.965 --> 23:04.005
I'm just... I'm doing my best, trying...

23:04.445 --> 23:05.485
trying to make you happy.

23:06.765 --> 23:07.605
Okay.

23:09.245 --> 23:10.085
Well, cheers.

23:15.245 --> 23:17.045
-All right?
-Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow.

23:17.125 --> 23:18.005
See you tomorrow.

23:24.325 --> 23:26.685
-[car engine starts]
-[Lisa] <i>Look...</i>

23:27.525 --> 23:28.445
<i>Audrey Hepburn.</i>

23:28.965 --> 23:29.885
[laughs]

23:30.445 --> 23:31.885
<i>Doesn't she look beautiful?</i>

23:31.965 --> 23:34.605
<i>-Brandy, you look so glamorous!</i>
<i>-</i>[Tony] <i>Oh...</i>

23:34.685 --> 23:37.605
-[Lisa laughs]
<i>-She's a laughing stock.</i>

23:37.685 --> 23:38.685
[Lisa] <i>It was her idea.</i>

23:38.765 --> 23:40.685
<i>-</i>[Tony] <i>How long did that take?</i>
-[Lisa] <i>I'd say...</i>

23:40.765 --> 23:42.085
<i>-ten minutes.</i>
<i>-</i>[Tony]<i> Brilliant.</i>

23:42.165 --> 23:45.965
[chuckling]

23:46.045 --> 23:47.765
-[doorbell rings]
-[Lisa laughing]

23:48.125 --> 23:49.285
[Lisa] <i>Happy with that.</i>

23:50.765 --> 23:51.725
[sighs]

23:54.845 --> 23:56.245
Bought you a little present.

23:56.845 --> 23:58.205
With the money you stole from me?

23:59.765 --> 24:00.765
-Yeah--
-Thoughtful.

24:10.525 --> 24:12.685
["Into My Arms"
by Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds playing]

24:14.245 --> 24:17.085
You, um,
sure you don't want a bit of this in it?

24:19.005 --> 24:19.845
Yeah, go on.

24:21.445 --> 24:22.285
Sure?

24:23.245 --> 24:24.725
What's the worst that can happen?

24:25.445 --> 24:27.205
Well... this.

24:30.325 --> 24:32.525
Look, I'm sorry about the whole, um...

24:33.405 --> 24:35.805
robbing money thing. It's not really me.

24:36.205 --> 24:37.445
It's the disease, right?

24:38.925 --> 24:39.885
We've all got excuses.

24:43.085 --> 24:45.245
I still can't believe
we've got stuff in common.

24:48.045 --> 24:49.325
Both lost our partners,

24:50.285 --> 24:51.925
both trying to numb the pain,

24:52.525 --> 24:53.485
both losers.

24:54.165 --> 24:55.245
No offense,

24:55.325 --> 24:57.365
but I look at you, and I think,

24:57.885 --> 24:59.085
"Fuck me.

24:59.725 --> 25:00.565
I'm like that."

25:04.605 --> 25:05.485
No, you're not.
