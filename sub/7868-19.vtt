Ooh.

D'oh!

01:08.453 --> 01:10.387
Hmm?

01:18.329 --> 01:20.063
Hmm.

02:04.005 --> 02:06.507
I don't understand, Master.

02:06.575 --> 02:09.342
I begin to fear you are too stupid.

02:09.411 --> 02:11.212
I love you, Romeo!

What's going on?

02:33.101 --> 02:34.735
Look at this electric bill!

02:34.803 --> 02:36.237
I'm not made of money!

02:36.304 --> 02:38.239
I'm made of man-meat
and a skeleton!

02:38.306 --> 02:41.408
It's time to unplug
these vampire appliances

02:41.476 --> 02:45.012
that plunge their prongs
into our creamy white outlets

02:45.080 --> 02:48.382
to quench their unholy
thirst for electrons.

02:48.450 --> 02:51.318
Lamp, computer, Jacob's Ladder...

02:51.386 --> 02:52.620
What the...?

02:52.687 --> 02:54.121
How long has this been running?

02:54.189 --> 02:55.122
I don't know.

02:55.190 --> 02:56.290
Dad, while I agree

02:56.358 --> 02:58.425
reducing consumption is great,

02:58.493 --> 03:01.262
it's hard to make permanent
changes in your lifestyle.

03:01.329 --> 03:02.663
Are you calling me fat?

03:02.731 --> 03:03.998
No.

03:04.065 --> 03:06.300
I am suggesting you
consider cheaper,

03:06.368 --> 03:08.402
alternate sources of energy.

03:08.470 --> 03:11.338
Hmm, Alternative Energy Expo.

03:11.406 --> 03:13.908
Where there's expos,
there's free Frisbees!

03:13.975 --> 03:15.309
Let's roll.
But we'd better make sure

03:15.377 --> 03:16.844
robbers don't know we're out.

03:18.880 --> 03:20.814
Come on, let's go.

03:20.882 --> 03:22.950
Who you waiting for?

03:23.018 --> 03:24.852
Come on.

03:27.222 --> 03:28.956
Do they think I'm like an idiot?

03:29.024 --> 03:31.992
I'm going to enjoy
poong on their carpet.

03:43.038 --> 03:43.938
Why, you...

03:45.473 --> 03:46.807
You son of a...

03:53.081 --> 03:55.316
Now, on to the next funny booth.

03:55.383 --> 03:57.918
Solar power is a bright idea!

03:57.986 --> 03:59.687
Yeah, so is getting a real job.

03:59.754 --> 04:01.221
Hey-- oh. Dad!

04:01.289 --> 04:02.423
I found what you're looking for!

04:02.490 --> 04:04.258
A churro you can eat in the shower?

04:08.029 --> 04:09.229
Goddag, friendlys.

04:09.297 --> 04:11.398
Behold to you-- wind!

04:11.466 --> 04:13.901
The energy that powers Denmark.

04:13.969 --> 04:17.303
Well, I'm not usually one
to take the word of a Dane.

04:17.372 --> 04:19.607
Plus, how can I afford it?

04:19.673 --> 04:22.576
Well, there are tax credits,
government rebates.

04:22.644 --> 04:25.479
It will pay for
itself in 12 to 18...

04:25.547 --> 04:27.247
Months? Lifetimes.

04:27.315 --> 04:30.084
Hmm, tie it to my car,
and you got a deal.

04:30.151 --> 04:32.353
Lars, get the twine!

04:32.420 --> 04:34.355
You will not regret this.

04:34.422 --> 04:36.156
I'm starting to regret it already.

04:36.224 --> 04:37.725
Too late. Lars got the twine.

04:40.195 --> 04:43.497
Dad, you are leadi.
g the way in clean energy.

04:43.565 --> 04:46.500
Yup, I Al-Gored it pretty good.

04:46.568 --> 04:50.037
Where's my Grammy for
audio book narration?

04:52.807 --> 04:55.209
It's making our
meter run backwards!

04:55.276 --> 04:56.443
Oh, my goodness!

04:56.511 --> 04:57.645
It means we're
traveling back in time!

04:57.712 --> 04:59.079
I can warn President Lincoln

04:59.147 --> 05:00.981
to dump his wife
before she goes crazy!

05:01.049 --> 05:02.282
Dad, all it means is,

05:02.350 --> 05:04.785
we're providing power
to the electric company.

05:04.853 --> 05:06.553
Oh, that's just great.

05:06.621 --> 05:09.957
I discover electricity,
and they want to take it from me!

05:11.559 --> 05:13.227
Hello, local utility?

05:13.294 --> 05:16.797
You greedy bastards have gouged
Homer Simpson for the last time.

05:16.865 --> 05:18.532
We will cancel your account, sir.

05:18.600 --> 05:20.501
The Simpsons are off the grid.

05:20.568 --> 05:22.970
And so far it's going great.

05:27.876 --> 05:30.110
Gentlemen, tonight's
game is brought to us

05:30.178 --> 05:31.945
by something special.

05:32.013 --> 05:35.115
The kite's best friend,
the flag's partner in patriotism,

05:35.183 --> 05:38.018
you've seen cherubs blow
it from map corners--

05:38.086 --> 05:39.820
the wind!

05:39.888 --> 05:41.455

05:49.931 --> 05:51.732
Don't worry,
I'll go see what's wrong.

05:53.268 --> 05:54.935
What the...?
Who turned off the wind?

05:55.003 --> 05:57.371
Dad, if we're really off the grid,

05:57.439 --> 05:59.873
then we won't get power
when the air is still.

05:59.941 --> 06:01.475
Oh.

06:01.543 --> 06:04.311
Well, I'm not crawling
back to big electricity!

06:04.379 --> 06:07.347
From now on,
the Simpsons are living...

06:07.415 --> 06:10.217

Oh, my smoothie is all lumpy!

06:58.566 --> 07:02.402
The wind may have stopped working,
but my brain nev...

07:02.470 --> 07:04.304
...er does.

07:04.372 --> 07:05.405
Check it out, gang.

07:09.677 --> 07:12.746
But, Dad, it defeats the purpose
if you're powering our windmill

07:12.814 --> 07:14.948
with the electricity from Flanders.

07:15.016 --> 07:18.986
Homer, this meeting of
your fan club is adjourned!

07:19.053 --> 07:21.388
But we haven't read the minutes
of last week's meeting!

07:23.258 --> 07:25.826
You used to be nicer!

07:32.433 --> 07:34.201
When is my turn over?

07:34.269 --> 07:36.403
Ugh, Bart, please!

07:36.471 --> 07:39.406
I'm trying to hear Dr.
House's third incorrect diagnosis

07:39.474 --> 07:41.742
before his final correct diagnosis!

07:43.678 --> 07:45.913
Dear Lord, you've
got the wind I need,

07:45.980 --> 07:47.514
I've got the prayers you crave.

07:47.582 --> 07:49.249
Let's make a deal.

07:52.887 --> 07:54.855
Whoa!

07:54.923 --> 07:58.192
nt's Weather Worriers are
reporting gusts up to 75...

07:59.694 --> 08:01.495
Now we're cookin' with wind!

08:01.563 --> 08:04.832
Homie, maybe this is
too much electricity.

08:04.899 --> 08:07.034
Nothing is ever right for you.

08:07.101 --> 08:10.137
Oh, why can't our house
ever be that bright?

08:10.205 --> 08:11.805
Nothing is ever right for you.

08:16.077 --> 08:17.978
Finally.

08:19.047 --> 08:21.148
Well, the lesson here is...

08:24.853 --> 08:27.120
We're gonna go check
out the wind damage.

08:27.188 --> 08:28.288
Be careful!

08:28.356 --> 08:29.790
If you see a downed power line,

08:29.858 --> 08:32.726
do whatever it is people
are supposed to do

08:32.794 --> 08:33.961
in that situation.

08:37.465 --> 08:39.700
Make it stop! Make it stop!

08:43.438 --> 08:45.806
Look at the cool
stuff that washed up!

08:45.874 --> 08:47.975
Scuba goggles!

08:48.042 --> 08:50.444
Oh, medical waste!

08:50.511 --> 08:51.645
Hmm?

08:52.947 --> 08:54.314
Whoa!

08:55.984 --> 08:57.484
Oh, my God!

08:58.686 --> 09:01.255
A beached whale!

09:07.562 --> 09:09.263
Bart, can you believe

09:09.330 --> 09:13.233
that something so mighty has
been rendered so powerless?

09:13.301 --> 09:15.469
I'm gonna have my next
birthday party on this thing.

09:17.305 --> 09:18.305
Whoa!

09:18.373 --> 09:20.874
<i> Ay, caramba!</i>

09:20.942 --> 09:22.609
Whoa!

09:26.897 --> 09:28.831
She's such a beautiful
shade of blue.

09:28.899 --> 09:31.767
I'm going to call you
Bluella the whale.

09:31.835 --> 09:33.102
Hmm?

09:33.170 --> 09:36.071
Check it out!
World's biggest armpit fart.

09:38.108 --> 09:39.909
You just made a powerful enemy!

09:42.746 --> 09:44.146
Come on, everybody!

09:44.214 --> 09:45.581
A whale needs help!

09:45.649 --> 09:46.882
Why should we?

09:46.950 --> 09:49.084
Yeah, where was that whale
when my mom moved out?

09:49.152 --> 09:51.086
Whales are mammals like us.

09:51.154 --> 09:53.589
They're sensitive and
deeply intelligent.

09:54.858 --> 09:55.858
Nerd!

09:57.494 --> 09:58.994
I'm going to get real help.

09:59.062 --> 10:01.597
Just try to keep her wet.

10:03.767 --> 10:05.968
Hey, Milhouse!

10:06.036 --> 10:08.003
Want to learn more about whaling?

10:08.071 --> 10:09.338
Sure!

10:11.241 --> 10:12.374
Hey, Milhouse!

10:12.442 --> 10:14.109
Want me to "knock it off?"

10:14.177 --> 10:16.512
I'm afraid to answer that.

10:16.580 --> 10:18.647
Never tell a bully you're afraid.

10:23.220 --> 10:25.221
Our wedding china's ruined.

10:25.288 --> 10:27.323
Oh, we'll have to eat
Thanksgiving dinner

10:27.390 --> 10:29.525
off regular plates like animals.

10:29.593 --> 10:31.060
Hey, Mom, Dad,

10:31.127 --> 10:32.561
there's a whale on the beach.

10:32.629 --> 10:35.197
You got to help me get
her back in the ocean.

10:36.766 --> 10:38.500
All right. Let me get my tool belt.

10:42.839 --> 10:46.475
Man, who are these belts made for,
French super models?

10:49.980 --> 10:51.513
Hurry, Dad, hurry!

10:53.116 --> 10:55.184
Homie, can I talk
to you for a second?

10:55.252 --> 10:57.019
Sure. Lisa, bring the car around.

10:57.087 --> 10:58.520
But I don't know how to drive.

10:58.588 --> 10:59.788
Haven't you learned anything

10:59.856 --> 11:00.923
from watching Bart drive?

11:00.991 --> 11:02.591
A little.

11:02.659 --> 11:04.994
Homie, I happened to
read about beached whales

11:05.061 --> 11:06.996
in <i>Springfield</i> <i>Geographic.</i>

11:07.063 --> 11:09.932
It usually does not end well.

11:11.935 --> 11:14.336
We can't let Lisa get her hopes up.

11:14.404 --> 11:15.938
Marge, how hard can it be?

11:16.006 --> 11:18.307
We're just rolling it into
the ocean from the beach.

11:18.375 --> 11:20.909
It's not like it's stuck
in the bottom of a well

11:20.977 --> 11:22.311
or in a Mexican prison.

11:23.913 --> 11:25.914
But that would make a great movie.

11:29.052 --> 11:31.420
Lisa is very sensitive.

11:31.488 --> 11:34.323
If something she loves
dies in front of her...

11:34.391 --> 11:36.158
That whale's not gonna die.

11:36.226 --> 11:37.726
We're busting him out of prison,

11:37.794 --> 11:39.395
no matter what you say, Escobar!

11:39.462 --> 11:41.163
God, this thing writes itself.

11:42.632 --> 11:44.600
Coming!

11:47.037 --> 11:49.772
Okay, we'll need the
town's strongest men

11:49.839 --> 11:52.341
to roll the whale
back in the water.

11:57.213 --> 11:59.415
Hmm. We need a better idea.

11:59.482 --> 12:03.018
We'll have to find
our ten smartest men.

12:10.860 --> 12:12.328
It's hard to believe

12:12.395 --> 12:14.897
anyone in that contest
can be considered smart.

12:16.866 --> 12:19.668
One... two...

12:19.736 --> 12:21.337
three... tug!

12:25.508 --> 12:26.809
Aah.

12:29.446 --> 12:31.647
Lisa, sweetheart,

12:31.715 --> 12:33.048
it's almost dinner time.

12:33.116 --> 12:34.750
Why don't you come home?

12:34.818 --> 12:37.619
I'll catch up with you
guys in a little bit.

12:39.289 --> 12:41.457
You know, when I'm sad,

12:41.524 --> 12:44.293
I read something beautiful
and true-- poetry.

12:45.395 --> 12:47.396
No, no, you're gonna like it.

12:47.464 --> 12:48.697
It's about the ocean.

12:48.765 --> 12:50.632
"The world below the brine.

12:50.700 --> 12:52.735
"Forests at the bottom of the sea.

12:52.802 --> 12:54.803
The branches and leaves..."

12:56.706 --> 12:59.007
"Sea-lettuce, vast lichens..."

13:00.110 --> 13:01.377
Wake up, Lis!

13:01.444 --> 13:03.011
They're doing it!

13:04.781 --> 13:06.682
Dorsal straps secured!

13:06.750 --> 13:08.350
Tail clamps in position!

13:08.418 --> 13:09.752
Congratulatory T-shirts

13:09.819 --> 13:10.986
silk-screened and distributed!

13:11.054 --> 13:12.187
Oh!

13:12.255 --> 13:14.356
Operation Desert Ocean is a go!

13:14.424 --> 13:17.526
Let's get this lady
fish into the blue zone!

13:17.594 --> 13:20.629
It was <i>my</i> idea to put the
whale in the water.

13:20.697 --> 13:22.598
Girl, you're going home!

13:22.665 --> 13:24.233
You're going home!

13:31.074 --> 13:32.574
Good-bye, Bluella!

13:32.642 --> 13:35.677
Send me a post card
from Tierra Del Fuego.

13:35.745 --> 13:38.514
Good-bye! Good-bye!

13:44.788 --> 13:46.321
Huh?

13:49.426 --> 13:50.325
Bluella?

13:53.229 --> 13:54.997
Oh, no.

14:06.755 --> 14:08.355
Don't worry, honey.

14:08.423 --> 14:10.691
Right now she's lying
on God's beach.

14:10.759 --> 14:12.660
She doesn't like
lying on the beach.

14:12.727 --> 14:14.562
She likes being in the ocean.

14:14.629 --> 14:16.697
Oh, Lisa, I'm sorry.

14:16.765 --> 14:18.299
I tried my best.

14:18.366 --> 14:19.934
I know it's really hard

14:20.001 --> 14:21.635
when you discover your
dad isn't perfect.

14:21.703 --> 14:23.070
Not perfect?

14:23.138 --> 14:24.605
You can say that again.

14:24.673 --> 14:27.007
I'm trying to be a
sensitive father,

14:27.075 --> 14:29.009
you unwanted moron!

14:29.077 --> 14:30.678
Lisa, where were we?

14:30.745 --> 14:33.247
Maybe I should just
be alone a little bit.

14:33.315 --> 14:35.382
Of course.

14:37.285 --> 14:40.221
Oh, it kills me to
see her like that.

14:40.288 --> 14:42.656
And if there's one
thing I can't stand,

14:42.724 --> 14:44.558
it's being killed.

14:48.663 --> 14:50.497
Milhouse, this'll be
the biggest dead animal

14:50.565 --> 14:52.166
we ever poked with a stick.

14:52.234 --> 14:53.767
If that flattened squirrel

14:53.835 --> 14:56.804
we poked last week
could only see us now.

15:03.545 --> 15:04.612
All right, back up, everybody.

15:04.679 --> 15:06.146
Oh, but not too much.

15:06.214 --> 15:08.916
You are definitely
gonna want to see this.

15:12.020 --> 15:16.090
So clean, how part of it
just disappears like that.

15:16.157 --> 15:17.691
Ah! Yuck!

15:27.936 --> 15:31.438
Citizens, today we honor
Bluella the whale,

15:31.506 --> 15:34.241
along with the victims of
the Great Whale Explosion.

15:35.810 --> 15:38.812
Could you please stop dynamiting?!

15:38.880 --> 15:40.848
CHIEF WIGGUM: Sorry.
I sat on the plunger.

15:40.916 --> 15:43.017
But Bluella will live on among us

15:43.084 --> 15:45.619
as we make use of every
part of her body,

15:45.687 --> 15:48.422
from blowhole to fluke.

15:48.490 --> 15:52.092
♪ And we did not catch the whale,
brave boys... ♪

15:52.160 --> 15:56.597
♪ And we did not
touch the whale... ♪

15:56.665 --> 16:00.467
Behold, I am Captain Kirk
from <i>Star Trek One.</i>

16:00.535 --> 16:01.802
<i>Two.</i>

16:01.870 --> 16:03.570
<i>Five. Generations.</i>

16:03.638 --> 16:05.539
<i>Boston Legal.</i>

16:06.675 --> 16:08.008
Now, Lisa,

16:08.076 --> 16:09.610
I know you miss your whale.

16:09.678 --> 16:12.012
so I got you a pet
that will never die.

16:12.080 --> 16:13.547
An invisible dog.

16:13.615 --> 16:16.250
Aw, look. He's doing his business.

16:16.318 --> 16:17.618
Hey! Not on the rug!

16:17.686 --> 16:19.086
You bad dog!

16:19.154 --> 16:20.821
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ooh! Ooh!

16:20.889 --> 16:22.356
Stop biting my leg!

16:22.424 --> 16:24.758
Ow! All right, that's it.
You're going outside.

16:27.262 --> 16:28.395
Bad dog, stop!

16:30.765 --> 16:32.366
Bluella?

16:32.434 --> 16:34.168
Oh, hey, there, Lisa.

16:34.235 --> 16:36.203
Just oiling the old door here.

16:36.271 --> 16:38.906
Finally silenced
that mournful wail.

16:42.711 --> 16:43.978
Oh.

16:45.547 --> 16:46.580
Huh?

17:03.698 --> 17:06.433
No. I'm not gonna be
disappointed again.

17:09.137 --> 17:11.238
Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew!

17:17.912 --> 17:21.080
They must be Bluella's children!

17:21.148 --> 17:23.916
Hello, whale calves!

17:23.984 --> 17:26.787
Your mother lives
on through you! Huh?

17:29.024 --> 17:30.657
Run! I mean, swim!

17:30.725 --> 17:32.192
I mean...

17:38.863 --> 17:41.431
Those baby whales are doomed,
just like their mom.

17:41.499 --> 17:42.899
Oh!

17:42.967 --> 17:44.634
I guess it's just nature's way.

17:47.104 --> 17:49.038
Nature is a toothless, dying hag.

17:49.106 --> 17:51.708
We are gonna save
those whale babies!

17:51.775 --> 17:54.310
Dad? Where did you get that boat?

17:54.378 --> 17:57.080
I'm taking it on a test drive
from the boat store. Get in.

18:00.885 --> 18:03.653
<i>Shark Week</i> just got
canceled.

18:03.721 --> 18:06.356
Drop the 'poon!

18:06.423 --> 18:08.057
Oh, come on! Leave me alone!

18:08.125 --> 18:10.193
I'm trying to save
your precious whales!

18:10.261 --> 18:11.995
We're not here to
protect the whales.

18:12.062 --> 18:13.630
We're here to protect the sharks.

18:13.697 --> 18:15.732
Did you know that
over 40 million sharks

18:15.799 --> 18:18.468
are slaughtered every year
to make shark-fin soup?

18:18.536 --> 18:20.603
You like sharks?

18:20.671 --> 18:22.972
Being a true eco-activist
means supporting

18:23.040 --> 18:25.141
every animal's struggle for life.

18:25.209 --> 18:26.676
Except for cockroaches. Yuck!

18:26.744 --> 18:28.244
Linda, please.

18:28.312 --> 18:32.782
Puh! Typical eco-jerks-
using words to talk.

18:36.887 --> 18:38.588
Dad, no! They're right.

18:38.656 --> 18:40.790
If the only way to save the whales

18:40.858 --> 18:42.325
is to kill another
innocent creature,

18:42.393 --> 18:43.993
I can't let you do it.

18:44.061 --> 18:46.763
Sharks, innocent? Please.

18:46.830 --> 18:48.798
Every year, they kill
a couple of people

18:48.866 --> 18:50.567
who do a series of stupid things.

18:50.634 --> 18:51.968
A shark's reptilian brain

18:52.036 --> 18:53.903
understands only one thing--

18:53.971 --> 18:55.838
the crime of murder.

19:04.582 --> 19:08.151
Dad! The sharks must think
you're a baby whale.

19:08.218 --> 19:09.719
Ooh, a <i>baby</i> whale.

19:09.787 --> 19:11.955
My diet <i>is</i> working.

19:12.022 --> 19:14.023
Why couldn't I be
eaten by a giraffe?

19:14.091 --> 19:15.758
That would be fun.

19:15.826 --> 19:18.561
Gently bonk the shark
on the nose with this.

19:18.629 --> 19:21.831
It'll either make him go
away or eat you quicker.

19:21.899 --> 19:23.666
D'oh! Huh?

19:23.734 --> 19:26.736
Ooh, maybe the blood will
scare the sharks off.

19:35.379 --> 19:38.348
It's the baby whales' dad!

19:38.415 --> 19:39.782
Thanks, buddy!

19:43.787 --> 19:45.855
Thanks for not letting
me give up, Dad.

19:45.923 --> 19:49.892
Hey, I'd do anything for a sweet,
intelligent mammal,

19:49.960 --> 19:51.761
by which I mean you.

19:51.829 --> 19:53.563
Oh.

19:57.468 --> 19:58.668
Do you think they'll be okay?

19:58.736 --> 20:00.303
Absolutely.

20:00.371 --> 20:02.639
He's young, he's got two cute kids.

20:02.706 --> 20:05.808
He'll be moving in with a
sexy lady octopus in no time.

20:05.876 --> 20:07.644
They'll have to sell
their old place.

20:07.711 --> 20:09.012
Too many memories.

20:09.079 --> 20:10.513
But if I'm not mistaken,

20:10.581 --> 20:12.682
there's a little
whale-a-puss on the way.

20:12.750 --> 20:14.283
(chuckling

20:14.351 --> 20:15.785
Tonight let's all draw pictures

20:15.853 --> 20:17.787
of what your father just said.
