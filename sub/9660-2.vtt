Eduardo's head on a pike

14:11.638 --> 14:13.539

14:13.540 --> 14:15.707
He's loyal to his family but

makes these places seem

14:46.872 --> 14:48.873

than they really are.

15:30.047 --> 15:31.481

there are more of them?

15:55.671 --> 15:57.872
We have to be prepared for anything.

16:08.018 --> 16:09.484
The room with the strong door

16:09.485 --> 16:11.686
is not for another wolf, is it?

16:11.687 --> 16:14.055
It's for your brother.

possibly prepare you.

16:41.550 --> 16:42.983
Do we really need that?

16:42.984 --> 16:45.653
Do you think Alexei would hurt us?

16:45.654 --> 16:48.355
Until he learns to control the wolf,

We should go back home where Alexei

17:15.049 --> 17:16.683
can't hurt anyone, where it's safe.

17:16.684 --> 17:18.550
We give Elena time.

I've told her, okay?

can come straight at us.

you seem to be knee-deep in blood.

29:50.552 --> 29:53.454
Doesn't quite answer my question.

29:53.455 --> 29:55.256
It is important to maintain protocol,

29:55.257 --> 29:56.656
don't you think?

29:56.657 --> 29:59.359
And friendships.

30:04.332 --> 30:06.200
To that end,

30:06.201 --> 30:08.734
maybe some of your fine scotch?

30:17.344 --> 30:18.677
Who was it this time?

30:20.448 --> 30:23.383
I'm more interested in why <i> you're</i> here.

30:23.384 --> 30:24.583
[Door opening, closing]

30:29.489 --> 30:30.688
Roman.

30:32.359 --> 30:33.625
We're fine.

30:37.264 --> 30:39.532
It seems I've landed

30:39.533 --> 30:41.833
at an inopportune time.

30:44.604 --> 30:45.805
You seem to have a knack

30:45.806 --> 30:48.441
for arriving at Stonehaven

30:48.442 --> 30:50.408
when we're in a state of disarray.

30:52.145 --> 30:53.344
What's our status?

30:55.882 --> 30:58.216
Eduardo is captured, he's in the cage.

30:58.217 --> 30:59.685
And the others? Bucky?

30:59.686 --> 31:00.920
ELENA: Taken care of.

31:00.921 --> 31:04.522
Eduardo Escobado?

31:04.523 --> 31:06.791
He is here?

31:06.792 --> 31:08.892
Is this news to you, Roman?

31:10.396 --> 31:13.598
Seems Upstate New York
is a popular destination

31:13.599 --> 31:15.567
this time of year.

31:15.568 --> 31:16.900
Jeremy, can I speak with you?

31:19.538 --> 31:21.573
Sure.

31:21.574 --> 31:23.574
Excuse me for a moment, yeah?

31:27.312 --> 31:29.814
ELENA: This isn't a coincidence, Jeremy.

31:29.815 --> 31:33.184
Roman shows up just as we catch Eduardo.

31:33.185 --> 31:35.318
The timing didn't escape me.

31:36.821 --> 31:40.324
Roman wants that little
weasel dead as much as I do.

31:40.325 --> 31:43.961
There's something else at play, here.

31:43.962 --> 31:46.197
Did Roman say anything to you?

31:46.198 --> 31:48.231
He said it's Russian business.

31:49.734 --> 31:51.768
You can't trust a word that he says.

31:51.769 --> 31:53.770
You have to get him out of here.

31:53.771 --> 31:55.972
Not until I know why he's here.

31:58.710 --> 32:00.511
Unless there's some specific concern

32:00.512 --> 32:02.344
that I should know about?

32:04.649 --> 32:05.949
- Hm?
- I'm just...

32:05.950 --> 32:07.918
I'm tired of being attacked, okay?

32:07.919 --> 32:10.286
I'm tired of being coiled all the time.

32:10.287 --> 32:12.554
Not knowing what's coming
around the next corner.

32:14.492 --> 32:15.691
This is the course I've chosen,

32:15.692 --> 32:16.893
we're going to stick to it.

32:16.894 --> 32:19.295
No matter how difficult.

32:19.296 --> 32:21.364
Now, this Pack will be strong

32:21.365 --> 32:22.632
but I'm not going to make

32:22.633 --> 32:24.466
unnecessary enemies right now.

32:25.636 --> 32:28.538
This is how we will restore order.

32:28.539 --> 32:30.304
Let me deal with Roman.

32:31.374 --> 32:32.574
Of course.

32:39.683 --> 32:42.284
[Phone notification chime]

32:49.292 --> 32:50.792
He's just stopping by?

32:50.793 --> 32:52.894
He expects us to believe that?

32:52.895 --> 32:56.265
I only trust Roman to be cunning.

32:56.266 --> 32:57.599
If he was in league with Eduardo,

32:57.600 --> 33:01.469
he'd be as far away
from here as possible.

33:01.470 --> 33:03.905
Okay. So now what?

33:03.906 --> 33:05.907
We take Roman at face value

33:05.908 --> 33:07.775
and we show him our hospitality.

33:08.778 --> 33:11.311
Make him comfortable.

33:13.916 --> 33:16.384
There's something missing.

33:16.385 --> 33:19.387
I get the sense we don't have
all the information yet.

33:19.388 --> 33:21.788
So we wait. And we watch.

33:37.772 --> 33:41.041
Sasha wants to meet with me.

33:41.042 --> 33:43.342
He left a message on my website.

33:47.881 --> 33:49.648
Are you going to go?

33:51.519 --> 33:52.986
The threat is over.

33:52.987 --> 33:54.386
We're safe now.

33:55.556 --> 33:57.090
And now with Roman here,

33:57.091 --> 33:59.692
there's that many more
questions about Sasha Antonov.

33:59.693 --> 34:01.561
Two Russians in one day.

34:01.562 --> 34:04.363
There's got to be a connection.

34:04.364 --> 34:06.397
Why don't you tell Jeremy about this?

34:08.601 --> 34:10.869
He's got enough on his plate.

34:11.938 --> 34:14.106
I want to figure this out first.

34:15.509 --> 34:18.011
Bring him the solution, not the problem.

34:18.012 --> 34:19.646
You want to make sure
he's really your father

34:19.647 --> 34:21.346
before you give him up to your Alpha.

34:22.849 --> 34:24.616
You have to be very careful.

34:26.753 --> 34:27.952
I will.

34:29.656 --> 34:31.523
You're coming with me.

34:42.594 --> 34:44.659
[Pleased chuckle]

34:45.663 --> 34:47.362
ROMAN: Very impressive.

34:49.224 --> 34:52.360
I didn't take you for the warrior type.

34:52.360 --> 34:55.293
You've never made the mistake
of crossing me, Roman.

34:57.298 --> 34:59.699
I save my vengeance for traitors.

35:01.729 --> 35:03.897
I know you are wondering

35:03.968 --> 35:05.901
what business I have here, Jeremy.

35:05.905 --> 35:07.740
I'll save you the obtrusiveness

35:07.741 --> 35:08.940
of the question.

35:10.444 --> 35:12.578
I have been tracking a very...

35:12.579 --> 35:15.480
dangerous Russian Mutt for years.

35:16.716 --> 35:19.985
I believe he is in North America.

35:19.986 --> 35:22.755
You know everyone in your territory.

35:22.756 --> 35:25.724
Perhaps you have come across him.

35:25.725 --> 35:28.259
Sasha Antonov.

35:29.829 --> 35:31.896
I've never heard that name.

35:33.900 --> 35:36.500
[Hum of traffic]

35:38.604 --> 35:39.936
I'll go in first.

35:42.642 --> 35:44.543
Will you join us?

35:44.544 --> 35:46.344
No, this is for you.

35:46.345 --> 35:48.580
Meet him, hear what he has to say.

35:48.581 --> 35:49.947
If I join the party,

35:49.948 --> 35:51.948
I can't guarantee I
won't get in his face.

35:56.889 --> 35:58.288
[Door chimes]

35:59.925 --> 36:03.727
[Instrumental music playing on stereo]

36:15.607 --> 36:17.407
[Door chimes]

36:26.851 --> 36:29.052
You got the message.

36:29.053 --> 36:31.654
It was Katia's idea to use the, uh...

36:31.655 --> 36:34.424
message board on your website.

36:34.425 --> 36:35.892
I thought they'd be here.

36:35.893 --> 36:37.293
They wanted to be, yeah.

36:37.294 --> 36:38.695
But they understood my, uh...

36:38.696 --> 36:40.996
wish to give you a little space.

36:42.800 --> 36:45.400
Come. Come. Sit.

36:47.438 --> 36:49.372
Are you hungry?

36:49.373 --> 36:50.573
It's okay. I'm good.

36:50.574 --> 36:51.773
Okay.

36:56.747 --> 36:57.946
Your friend?

37:03.019 --> 37:04.919
My fiancé.

37:08.558 --> 37:10.960
Does he want to join us?

37:10.961 --> 37:13.361
You wouldn't want to let
his guard down, no.

37:16.499 --> 37:18.734
You've been through so much.

37:18.735 --> 37:20.568
We all have, right?

37:23.673 --> 37:26.007
What did you do with the body?

37:26.008 --> 37:27.643
Burned and buried.

37:27.644 --> 37:30.344
No one will find him.

37:32.649 --> 37:34.714
Thank you for helping me.

37:36.585 --> 37:38.552
I'm sorry to say it's not the first time

37:38.553 --> 37:41.722
I've made a wolf disappear
with my children.

37:41.723 --> 37:44.124
It's how we stayed safe in Dawson.

37:45.995 --> 37:47.627
How many have you killed?

37:51.433 --> 37:54.567
I do what is necessary
to protect my family.

37:57.839 --> 38:00.106
What am I getting myself into, here?

38:01.910 --> 38:05.613
There's so much I have to tell you.

38:05.614 --> 38:07.747
So much. About us.

38:07.748 --> 38:09.649
About your mother.

38:09.650 --> 38:11.418
What our lives have looked like.

38:11.419 --> 38:14.053
Where we live, and why...

38:17.558 --> 38:18.925
I'm listening.

38:20.127 --> 38:21.526
- [Impact thud]
- [Groan]

38:23.764 --> 38:25.598
[Panting]

38:25.599 --> 38:27.400
This is not

38:27.401 --> 38:28.601
how you thought it would end,

38:28.602 --> 38:30.403
is it, Eduardo?

38:30.404 --> 38:31.903
Crushing defeat.

38:33.774 --> 38:35.675
That is the price for your treachery

38:35.676 --> 38:37.977
and your arrogance.

38:37.978 --> 38:41.180
Defeat is a series of losses.

38:41.181 --> 38:43.682
The loss of freedom,

38:43.683 --> 38:46.552
of control.

38:46.553 --> 38:48.787
I'm in total control, now.

38:48.788 --> 38:51.090
I make all the decisions.

38:51.091 --> 38:52.658
How swiftly this blade

38:52.659 --> 38:55.928
is going to fall on your neck, Eduardo.

38:55.929 --> 39:00.699
How accurate the angle of the cut.

39:00.700 --> 39:03.001
Swift, painful...

39:03.002 --> 39:04.836
it makes no difference to me.

39:06.439 --> 39:08.940
Death to me is death to my bloodline.

39:08.941 --> 39:10.476
Any bloodline you left

39:10.477 --> 39:12.209
would have been slaughtered. [Impact]

39:12.210 --> 39:13.777
EDUARDO: [Spitting]

39:13.779 --> 39:16.848
You did your sons a service
by not having them.

39:16.849 --> 39:18.884
The name Antonov,

39:18.885 --> 39:21.152
it comes with a heavy price.

39:21.153 --> 39:23.054
It affects my children as well,

39:23.055 --> 39:25.122
so we've been living in hiding.

39:26.225 --> 39:28.025
For how long?

39:28.026 --> 39:30.827
SASHA: For me, since
before you were born.

39:30.829 --> 39:32.930
For Katia, Alexei...

39:32.931 --> 39:35.199
all their lives.

39:35.200 --> 39:37.067
I don't want to bring any of that

39:37.068 --> 39:39.537
to your door, please.

39:39.538 --> 39:42.006
That's not why I came.

39:42.007 --> 39:44.108
I came to see you.

39:44.109 --> 39:45.876
To see if it was true.

39:47.545 --> 39:50.047
And if it was, to try and...

39:50.048 --> 39:51.949
claw back 30 years of lost time.

39:51.950 --> 39:53.150
Time...

39:53.151 --> 39:55.585
That is the issue.

39:55.586 --> 39:57.221
The timing, you...

39:57.222 --> 39:59.990
You arrive exactly when
we're being attacked.

39:59.991 --> 40:01.191
Would I have saved you

40:01.192 --> 40:03.058
if I was here to kill you?

40:06.163 --> 40:08.097
I want to believe you.

40:08.098 --> 40:10.699
After today, the name
Escobado comes to an end.

40:13.704 --> 40:15.939
And you, Danvers.

40:15.940 --> 40:19.208
Your name will be forever sealed away

40:19.209 --> 40:21.876
in this mausoleum of a house.

40:23.613 --> 40:26.849
Even now, you live, but to what end, hm?

40:26.850 --> 40:28.884
You built a family,

40:28.885 --> 40:31.921
but none of it is real.

40:31.922 --> 40:34.089
They are not your blood.

40:36.626 --> 40:38.761
Pretend all you want,

40:38.762 --> 40:40.996
but you are like me,

40:40.997 --> 40:43.297
without a legacy.

40:45.168 --> 40:46.702
I will die

40:46.703 --> 40:48.737
with the satisfaction of knowing

40:48.738 --> 40:50.873
that you will share my fate.

40:50.874 --> 40:52.841
[Panting]

40:52.842 --> 40:54.708
Alone in life.

40:56.212 --> 40:58.279
Forgotten in death.

41:03.119 --> 41:05.719
You're not going to be
completely forgotten, Eduardo.

41:07.223 --> 41:10.658
I'm going to remember
your death very fondly.

41:10.659 --> 41:12.793
For many, many happy years.

41:14.864 --> 41:16.063
But what are memories,

41:16.064 --> 41:17.966
if not to share with friends?

41:17.967 --> 41:19.934
You once tried to blackmail me

41:19.935 --> 41:22.770
into killing the Russian Alpha.

41:22.771 --> 41:25.071
Roman, cut off this snake's head.

41:27.341 --> 41:31.077
EDUARDO: I am not the only
snake in your garden, Danvers.

41:31.079 --> 41:34.215
It was so easy to get Bucky to join me.

41:34.216 --> 41:36.282
One by one, your Pack

41:36.283 --> 41:37.984
will turn against you.

41:37.986 --> 41:40.186
You will be my trophy.

41:40.187 --> 41:43.255
EDUARDO: Yes, Jeremy.

41:43.257 --> 41:45.792
Let him take the prize.

41:45.793 --> 41:49.262
Buy his friendship with my head.

41:49.263 --> 41:51.331
A Russian pig

41:51.332 --> 41:54.300
will eat anything when he is hungry.

41:54.301 --> 41:55.935
Even his friends.

41:59.240 --> 42:01.940
Hmm, I will wait for you in hell.

42:01.941 --> 42:03.141
- [Screaming]
- [Splat]

42:11.618 --> 42:13.619
This was yours.

42:13.620 --> 42:15.187
I've carried this with me

42:15.188 --> 42:18.623
for the last 30 years.

42:28.902 --> 42:30.169
Your mother, you know...

42:30.170 --> 42:33.738
she wore a certain perfume.

42:33.739 --> 42:36.875
Krasnaya Moskva.

42:36.876 --> 42:40.779
"Red Moscow". Soviet perfume. But...

42:40.780 --> 42:43.347
On her, it was the scent of home.

42:45.285 --> 42:46.718
And I think sometimes

42:46.719 --> 42:48.886
I still smell it on your baby shoe.

42:52.725 --> 42:54.224
My mother...

42:57.229 --> 42:59.898
And Alexei and Katia's mother?

42:59.899 --> 43:01.933
A woman I met 10 years

43:01.934 --> 43:03.934
after your mother died.

43:09.040 --> 43:10.941
Katia and Alexei saw their mother

43:10.942 --> 43:14.010
torn apart by a wolf with one red eye.

43:15.180 --> 43:17.448
Roman's assassin.

43:17.449 --> 43:18.744
Roman Navikev?

43:18.975 --> 43:19.766
Hmm.

43:20.395 --> 43:22.362
ELENA: Why would he have
their mother killed?

43:22.364 --> 43:24.764
[Effort groans]

43:25.801 --> 43:28.636
She was innocent.

43:28.637 --> 43:30.437
Roman was after me.

43:32.408 --> 43:35.176
He's wanted to kill me for 30 years.

43:35.177 --> 43:38.245
Roman Navikev is at Stonehaven.
