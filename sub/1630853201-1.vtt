WEBVTT

00:32.125 --> 00:34.125
-Ugh! This pick sucks.

00:44.208 --> 00:46.250
-My strap's not right. That's…

00:46.833 --> 00:48.250
Okay. Okay, there we go.

00:52.416 --> 00:53.541
-Cocks.

00:53.625 --> 00:55.916
All right, hold on.
Let's scoop that midrange.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.583
-Nice.

01:04.041 --> 01:06.541
One, two, three, four!

01:11.125 --> 01:13.208
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

01:14.291 --> 01:15.208
What was that?

01:16.375 --> 01:19.458
I was just-- You said play something fast.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.041
Did you read the music
that I wrote for you?

01:23.125 --> 01:24.000
Yeah.

01:25.333 --> 01:27.083
Do you know what polyrhythms are?

01:28.541 --> 01:29.375
Yeah.

01:29.875 --> 01:30.833
<i> I don't.</i>

01:32.666 --> 01:35.000
<i>These aren't my drums.</i>
<i>They belong to Hunter.</i>

01:35.583 --> 01:39.541
<i>And he came up with the band name.</i>
<i>I don't play the drums, I play the drum.</i>

01:40.458 --> 01:43.041
<i>This drum, in marching band for two years.</i>

01:43.625 --> 01:47.125
<i>I do it to get out of PE,</i>
<i>but Hunter says that doesn't matter.</i>

01:47.625 --> 01:50.041
<i>All it takes to be great</i>
<i>is commitment and sacrifice,</i>

01:50.125 --> 01:51.666
<i>which is what metal's all about.</i>

01:52.166 --> 01:54.250
<i>Or maybe it's about power,</i>

01:54.333 --> 01:57.708
<i>or sticking it to the man,</i>
<i>or denim, or motorcycles, or speed,</i>

01:57.791 --> 01:59.166
<i>or the devil.</i>

01:59.250 --> 02:02.083
<i>I don't totally understand it,</i>
<i>but Hunter says I don't have to.</i>

02:02.166 --> 02:03.291
<i>All I have to do is--</i>

02:03.375 --> 02:05.083
-Play something heavy, man.
-Okay.

02:05.166 --> 02:08.083
Like, uh… "Rock of Ages"?

02:08.875 --> 02:09.916
Heavy.

02:12.208 --> 02:16.125
Play… something heavy.

02:18.291 --> 02:21.541
Play… something heavy.

02:38.375 --> 02:39.708
We need a bass player.

02:39.791 --> 02:41.958
-Mm.
-A bass player will be huge for us.

02:42.041 --> 02:43.875
-Yeah, no doubt.
-No doubt.

02:45.208 --> 02:46.041
No doubt.

03:27.250 --> 03:29.458
-Stop. Stop.

03:29.541 --> 03:30.958
That's enough for today.

03:31.041 --> 03:33.416
Emily, can I talk to you for a second?

03:35.250 --> 03:39.875
The song you're playing
is not the song they are playing.

03:39.958 --> 03:42.208
I'm not sure you're even playing a march.

03:42.291 --> 03:45.375
We've talked about this.
You have to listen and play.

03:45.458 --> 03:48.041
It's an orchestra, right?
I know we're in a marching band, but--

03:48.791 --> 03:50.250
I see you're upset.

03:50.333 --> 03:51.583
Fuck you!

03:52.166 --> 03:53.250
Fuck you!

03:53.833 --> 03:55.875
Fuck! I don't give a fuck
about what I'm playing!

03:55.958 --> 03:58.125
I don't give a fuck
about what they're playing!

03:58.750 --> 04:00.208
Fuck you!

04:00.291 --> 04:02.208
Fuck your shitty band!

04:02.291 --> 04:03.625
-Fucking bullshit!

04:03.708 --> 04:07.083
-Too bad she can't play like she throws.
-I don't give a fuck, so fuck you!

04:07.166 --> 04:08.166
Fuck you!

04:08.250 --> 04:10.000
-Cunt!

04:10.833 --> 04:12.708
You can't say that in America.

04:12.791 --> 04:15.250
<i> That seems pretty metal to me,</i>
<i>but I'm not sure.</i>

04:15.333 --> 04:18.083
<i>-I'll ask Hunter about it.</i>

04:18.666 --> 04:20.416
<i>He's been into many things</i>
<i>since I met him,</i>

04:20.500 --> 04:22.583
<i>but he's stuck with metal</i>
<i>longer than any of them.</i>

04:23.083 --> 04:26.666
<i>When his mom left in seventh grade,</i>
<i>he decided it was the key to everything.</i>

04:29.166 --> 04:31.375
<i>If we devote ourselves to metal,</i>
<i>we'll own this school.</i>

04:31.458 --> 04:32.583
Watch it.

04:34.083 --> 04:37.375
<i>Everybody will see what we</i>
<i>really are and worship us like gods.</i>

04:40.458 --> 04:42.041
<i>I'm willing to give it a try.</i>

04:42.625 --> 04:43.708
<i>Hunter's been my best friend</i>

04:43.791 --> 04:47.333
<i>ever since he stopped Molly Levine</i>
<i>from pulling out my hair in third grade.</i>

04:47.416 --> 04:48.791
<i>He always looks out for me.</i>

04:57.625 --> 04:59.541
Skip Hoffman sucks pig dicks.

05:00.291 --> 05:03.833
I don't think he was trying to hit me.
I was just in the way.

05:03.916 --> 05:06.500
-Clay Moss.
-You ready for the game?

05:06.583 --> 05:09.458
What I'm ready for
is your homecoming after-party, man.

05:09.541 --> 05:11.333
Yep, my parents are in Geneva.

05:11.416 --> 05:14.041
So bring the whole school
if you want, man, seriously.

05:14.125 --> 05:16.500
-Tell whoever. Everybody's invited.
-All right.

05:16.583 --> 05:18.166
-Peace out, bro.
-Catch you.

05:40.541 --> 05:41.375
Hey, man.

05:43.208 --> 05:44.041
What's up?

05:48.625 --> 05:50.208
Asked your mom about the double bass kit?

05:51.333 --> 05:52.458
What'd she say?

05:52.958 --> 05:55.458
She said she doesn't have
a thousand dollars.

05:58.083 --> 06:00.000
Okay, well, what about
a double bass pedal?

06:00.083 --> 06:02.083
Won't get the resonance,
but we'll have that attack.

06:02.166 --> 06:04.916
Yeah, she said
she doesn't have $150 either.

06:14.666 --> 06:16.916
She's in my speech class.
I think she's English.

06:17.791 --> 06:19.458
Scottish. I don't know.

06:19.958 --> 06:22.375
I heard she went apeshit
on the band teacher.

06:22.458 --> 06:23.333
Yeah.

06:24.250 --> 06:25.625
That's one messed up chick.

06:42.916 --> 06:44.291
<i> I've never been to a party.</i>

06:44.375 --> 06:46.625
<i>I always wondered</i>
<i>what people like this did at them.</i>

06:46.708 --> 06:49.416
<i>People whose bands</i>
<i>didn't have names like Skullfucker.</i>

06:50.375 --> 06:51.375
<i>Now I know.</i>

06:52.625 --> 06:53.458
<i>Here we are…</i>

06:54.458 --> 06:55.875
<i>in the middle of it all.</i>

07:02.458 --> 07:03.333
This rules.

07:03.916 --> 07:04.916
Awesome idea.

07:06.333 --> 07:08.000
He said everybody's invited.

07:11.166 --> 07:12.250
How do they do it?

07:12.333 --> 07:13.958
What are you talking about?

07:14.666 --> 07:17.791
This is like three chords and they still
can't get it right. They suck.

07:17.875 --> 07:18.791
Look at the drummer.

07:18.875 --> 07:20.750
-He's high out of his mind.

07:20.833 --> 07:25.750
I mean, them, all of them.
How did they just… do this,

07:26.958 --> 07:28.625
like it's the easiest thing ever?

07:29.125 --> 07:32.458
Okay, listen to me.
Things are gonna happen for us.

07:32.541 --> 07:34.708
Someday, all these people
are gonna be like,

07:34.791 --> 07:38.958
"Holy shit!
Kevin Schlieb and Hunter Sylvester?"

07:39.041 --> 07:40.875
"I went to high school with those guys."

07:40.958 --> 07:43.458
"I could've even hung out
with them, maybe."

07:44.208 --> 07:45.583
But it's gonna be too late,

07:45.666 --> 07:48.750
'cause we're gonna be too busy hanging out
with the guys from Iron Maiden.

08:04.166 --> 08:05.041
Great.

08:08.166 --> 08:11.208
Hunter, it's not that bad, actually,
once you get used to it. Seriously.

08:12.083 --> 08:15.041
Hunter, seriously,
our band is gonna be so awesome.

08:15.125 --> 08:18.541
I'm gonna practice like five hours a day.
I'm gonna be better than Ringo Starr.

08:19.166 --> 08:20.375
-Mmm.
-Hey!

08:23.791 --> 08:26.583
Whoo! Heavy metal rules!

08:26.666 --> 08:27.791
I have to go pee.

08:28.916 --> 08:32.416
-I'll drive you home when you're finished.
-After. After pee-pee.

09:04.916 --> 09:07.083
What are you staring at?

09:10.666 --> 09:11.500
You.

09:13.083 --> 09:14.083
Why?

09:14.166 --> 09:16.750
Because you're pretty.
Why else do people stare at you?

09:18.291 --> 09:19.666
People don't stare at me.

09:19.750 --> 09:21.333
-That's dumb.
-What?

09:21.416 --> 09:22.583
Why don't they?

09:22.666 --> 09:24.958
I could give you a million reasons.

09:25.041 --> 09:26.625
My face is too narrow…

09:26.708 --> 09:30.375
<i>I am talking to a girl.</i>
<i>I'm not even afraid of her.</i>

09:30.458 --> 09:31.500
<i>Beer is amazing.</i>

09:31.583 --> 09:32.708
…and I'm very pale.

09:32.791 --> 09:35.458
<i>This party was a great idea.</i>
<i>I don't care what Hunter says.</i>

09:35.541 --> 09:37.625
-And my nose…
<i>-Even he must be having fun right now.</i>

09:38.208 --> 09:39.583
What's happening, man?

09:39.666 --> 09:42.291
Hey, he just called you a dipshit.

09:42.791 --> 09:45.041
-No. No, I--
-What did you call me?

09:45.125 --> 09:46.958
I didn't say anything to anybody. I swear.

09:47.041 --> 09:48.291
Yes, you did.

09:49.750 --> 09:50.583
Really?

09:52.000 --> 09:52.958
Really.

09:54.166 --> 09:56.208
That's why they don't stare at me.

09:57.958 --> 09:59.166
They all stare at her.

10:00.375 --> 10:02.208
Her? I could've stared at her.

10:02.291 --> 10:06.416
I-- I don't-- I don't know either of you.
I'm an impartmentege.

10:06.500 --> 10:10.458
I'm an impart-- impartial judge.

10:11.583 --> 10:12.500
You're funny.

10:14.541 --> 10:17.208
-Ow!

10:17.291 --> 10:18.333
Ah!

10:23.583 --> 10:24.583
Ah!

10:29.125 --> 10:30.291
Dude, what the fuck?

10:32.166 --> 10:33.541
Are you good, bruh? You hurt?

10:33.625 --> 10:36.250
-Here, let me help you.
-No, no. Let me help you.

10:36.333 --> 10:37.500
Take lessons.

10:37.583 --> 10:40.166
-You guys suck… bruh.
-Ooh.

10:40.250 --> 10:43.500
I'm sorry that you feel that way.
Do you play?

10:43.583 --> 10:45.041
Yeah, I have a band.

10:45.125 --> 10:47.583
Me and my friend over here. A real band.

10:47.666 --> 10:49.291
A serious band.

10:49.375 --> 10:50.708
Not like you fucktards.

10:55.583 --> 10:58.958
Got it. Um, I guess we'll be seeing you
at the Battle of the Bands then.

11:00.291 --> 11:03.625
There hasn't been a Battle of the Bands
since Dave Migdall hung brain on stage.

11:03.708 --> 11:05.083
There is this year.

11:05.166 --> 11:08.666
Go sign up with Dean Swanson,
but maybe don't say "fucktard,"

11:08.750 --> 11:11.083
'cause she's
a Special Olympics ambassador.

11:16.208 --> 11:18.291
All right, guys.
Let's keep this party going!

11:18.375 --> 11:19.708
Give me your car keys.

11:21.750 --> 11:23.333
-Come on.

11:28.333 --> 11:29.166
Mm.

12:00.333 --> 12:01.208
Hey.

12:01.291 --> 12:02.750
I was next.

12:06.625 --> 12:07.833
Hunter, I am busy.

12:07.916 --> 12:10.375
If you'd like to wait
until I am done with the Merinos--

12:10.458 --> 12:12.541
I demand you let us compete
in the Battle of the Bands.

12:13.125 --> 12:14.208
Okay.

12:14.291 --> 12:16.666
Not letting us play just because
we're a post-death metal band

12:16.750 --> 12:19.291
would be a complete violation
of our First Amendment rights.

12:19.375 --> 12:22.333
Your First Amendment rights
as a minor are unclear,

12:22.416 --> 12:24.916
but I agree it would be wrong
to exclude you.

12:26.583 --> 12:29.041
So why didn't
anybody tell us about it?

12:29.625 --> 12:32.250
-I wasn't aware you had a death metal--
-Post-death.

12:33.666 --> 12:34.500
Thank you, Frank.

12:35.083 --> 12:36.625
A post-death metal band.

12:37.375 --> 12:38.958
You're welcome to participate,

12:39.041 --> 12:42.000
as long as your performance
is appropriate.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.291
I had to work on her, but we're in.

12:52.875 --> 12:53.791
Awesome.

12:55.791 --> 12:58.583
So I guess we should start
looking for a bass player, huh?

12:58.666 --> 13:00.125
Yeah. Yeah, definitely.

13:01.541 --> 13:02.791
This is huge for us.

13:02.875 --> 13:05.791
Battle of the Bands is where
it starts for people. Check it out.

13:07.333 --> 13:09.041
-Troy Nix.

13:09.625 --> 13:10.791
Jesus.

13:10.875 --> 13:15.375
Guitarist and singer of Kiloton,
Battle of the Bands winners 1996.

13:18.875 --> 13:19.916
They were gods.

13:20.791 --> 13:22.791
No one in this school
liked heavy music same as now,

13:22.875 --> 13:25.750
but Kiloton terrorized their way
straight to victory.

13:25.833 --> 13:26.958
By 1997,

13:27.041 --> 13:29.833
they were considered the greatest
unsigned metal band in the country.

13:29.916 --> 13:33.083
They could have been right up there
with Metallica or Pantera,

13:33.625 --> 13:34.541
but they broke up.

13:35.333 --> 13:36.958
I think drinking was involved.

13:39.208 --> 13:41.916
But you and me,
that's not gonna happen to us.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.958
This is our moment.
Heavy music is gonna rise up.

13:45.041 --> 13:47.833
We win the Battle of the Bands,
parlay that win into gigs,

13:47.916 --> 13:49.750
and then those gigs score us a deal.

13:50.791 --> 13:51.916
Okay. Uh…

13:52.458 --> 13:54.875
-What kind of deal?

13:54.958 --> 13:56.916
Cocks. Okay.
I've gotta get all the way to C Hall.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.500
But, um, meet me after school.
We've got work to do.

14:04.166 --> 14:05.333
Hail Satan.

14:05.916 --> 14:06.916
'Sup, Robbie?

14:09.125 --> 14:10.875
-Hop in.
-Where are we going?

14:15.208 --> 14:17.916
<i> It doesn't seem metal</i>
<i>to ask if he's got his dad's permission,</i>

14:18.000 --> 14:19.375
<i>-so I won't.</i>

14:22.125 --> 14:23.541
<i>But this…</i>

14:25.708 --> 14:29.000
<i>This definitely seems metal, right?</i>
<i>I mean, I think it does.</i>

14:30.166 --> 14:31.833
<i>I'm not sure my mom and dad will.</i>

14:31.916 --> 14:34.291
These drums
are gonna be huge for us.

14:34.375 --> 14:35.625
<i> He's right.</i>

14:37.125 --> 14:38.541
<i>-They're huge.</i>

15:00.916 --> 15:02.125
Shut the fuck up!

15:05.083 --> 15:06.333
Can I borrow the car?

15:06.833 --> 15:08.916
If you drop your brother off first.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.208
Your father will pick him up
between shifts.

15:15.958 --> 15:19.875
I'm the best at crawl,
and I can tread water the second longest.

15:19.958 --> 15:20.875
That's good, Earl.

15:20.958 --> 15:24.041
And I can do the best cannonball,
everybody says.

15:27.500 --> 15:29.041
What's all this stuff?

15:29.125 --> 15:30.500
My drums.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.625
Drums are dumb.

15:34.750 --> 15:35.625
Yeah.

16:43.375 --> 16:45.166
I thought you were a clarinet player.

16:46.291 --> 16:47.416
No. No.

16:48.375 --> 16:50.875
That was just so
I could do marching band instead of PE.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
I do that too.

16:55.333 --> 16:56.166
I'm Kevin.

16:57.083 --> 16:57.916
Emily.

16:59.958 --> 17:00.791
Um…

17:03.750 --> 17:05.166
I saw you on the field.

17:08.291 --> 17:09.875
Yeah, that was my fault.

17:10.500 --> 17:12.291
I hadn't taken my meds for, like…

17:12.375 --> 17:14.166
…a week.

17:16.250 --> 17:18.291
I-- I take Pepcid, so…

17:19.458 --> 17:20.291
Mm.

17:26.250 --> 17:29.250
Do you like… heavy metal at all?

17:29.833 --> 17:31.666
Like <i>Rock of Ages?</i>

17:33.708 --> 17:34.791
Uh, no.

17:35.958 --> 17:36.916
More like…

17:38.416 --> 17:40.875
post-death doom metal?

17:42.083 --> 17:43.458
I don't know what that is.

18:31.666 --> 18:36.500
And the Slippers of Spider Climbing
go to Malmsteen of Gorgoroth.

18:38.291 --> 18:43.250
What kind of girlie name
is Malmsteen of Gorgoroth?

18:43.333 --> 18:46.000
I don't know, Dad. Why don't you ask
one of your real housewives

18:46.083 --> 18:48.125
while you're shoving water balloons
into their tits?

18:50.500 --> 18:51.458
Plastic surgeon.

18:53.791 --> 18:56.666
<i> I understand </i>Dungeons & Dragons
<i>even less than metal,</i>

18:56.750 --> 18:59.208
<i>but it's a chance for us</i>
<i>to hang out with new people,</i>

18:59.291 --> 19:01.541
<i>especially ones who play the bass.</i>

19:01.625 --> 19:02.458
Malmsteen…

19:02.541 --> 19:05.250
<i> If he joins Skullfucker,</i>
<i>then we're a band, right?</i>

19:05.333 --> 19:07.541
<i>-So we can play Battle of the Bands.</i>

19:07.625 --> 19:10.500
<i>If people like us,</i>
<i>maybe they'll ask us to play some parties.</i>

19:10.583 --> 19:11.750
<i>I hope Hunter likes this guy.</i>

19:12.333 --> 19:15.000
<i>Sometimes he's not so nice to people</i>
<i>when he's uncomfortable.</i>

19:15.083 --> 19:16.333
<i>Being around his dad makes him--</i>

19:16.416 --> 19:19.541
Well, Malmsteen just can't believe

19:19.625 --> 19:23.083
that a halfling rogue
would be dumb and ungrateful enough

19:23.166 --> 19:25.625
to try and rip off a half-orc barbarian

19:25.708 --> 19:28.916
who just saved him from five ice toads.

19:30.875 --> 19:32.625
But he thinks he'll show mercy.

19:34.833 --> 19:36.666
Until he remembers
that mercy is for the weak.

19:36.750 --> 19:39.250
Malmsteen pulls out Hell Slinger,
his +3 great sword…

19:39.333 --> 19:40.166
Hunter.

19:40.250 --> 19:43.208
…and he tells Auriac Stormhollow
to shut his glory hole

19:43.291 --> 19:45.250
before he starts his first attack.

19:46.958 --> 19:49.625
-Plus ten, that's a hit.
-Hunter, don't be an idiot.

19:49.708 --> 19:52.666
He runs the blade
between the thief's ribs.

19:52.750 --> 19:54.333
-Second attack.

19:54.416 --> 19:55.375
Uh-oh!

19:55.458 --> 19:56.500
There goes the leg.

19:57.500 --> 19:58.625
And for the final attack…

19:59.958 --> 20:01.250
Oh, shit.

20:01.333 --> 20:04.333
Head over to Dr. Sylvester's
for some post-op implants,

20:04.416 --> 20:07.041
because I just chopped off your dick.

20:10.916 --> 20:12.625
Sure. Sure.

20:13.125 --> 20:16.958
You just remember that those implants
are what paid for your guitar,

20:17.041 --> 20:18.583
your incel action figures,

20:18.666 --> 20:22.541
and all your dumbass
Satan-worship T-shirts!

20:24.833 --> 20:26.500
I'm gonna go play tennis!

20:28.416 --> 20:29.916
Did you see my American Express?

20:36.125 --> 20:37.583
Where are you going?

20:37.666 --> 20:38.791
Leaving.

20:39.375 --> 20:42.916
This sucks compared to<i> Call of Duty.</i>
Kevin, see you in class.

20:43.583 --> 20:46.958
Hunter, we were going to ask him
to play bass for us.

20:48.625 --> 20:50.291
He says he's pretty good.

20:50.375 --> 20:53.125
It's for the best.
We can never trust a guy like that.

20:57.708 --> 20:59.333
I'm telling you,
she's really good.

20:59.416 --> 21:02.083
We need a bass player.
A metal bass player.

21:02.166 --> 21:03.166
She can be metal.

21:03.250 --> 21:05.583
That's the most ridiculous thing
I've ever heard.

21:05.666 --> 21:08.500
Why? Why is that the most ridiculous thing
you've ever heard?

21:08.583 --> 21:10.333
Because a cello-playing girl
is so non-metal

21:10.416 --> 21:13.000
that even thinking about it
is evaporating my balls.

21:13.708 --> 21:16.708
A lot of the time, Hunter,
I don't know what you're talking about.

21:16.791 --> 21:18.708
Metal, not metal… Uh…

21:19.375 --> 21:21.458
Maybe I'm just not right for Skullfucker.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.500
Okay, switch places with me.

21:40.458 --> 21:42.041
-What?
-Just do it.

21:43.083 --> 21:45.333
Slide over.
Open the door, but don't get out.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.208
-Did you get her number?
-Of course I got it.

21:50.291 --> 21:51.458
Then, what is it?

21:51.541 --> 21:54.000
I know I said I'd get her number,
but I got her Snapchat.

21:54.083 --> 21:56.666
-Snapchat is actually…
-No! No, no, no, no.

21:56.750 --> 21:58.666
-No, no, no, no.
-It's fine.

21:58.750 --> 22:01.500
-It's the same thing.
-It's not the same thing. You know it.

22:02.125 --> 22:02.958
What?

22:03.708 --> 22:05.041
Suck it, cunt.

22:05.125 --> 22:06.666
Ow!

22:06.750 --> 22:08.750
Go, go! Fuck!

22:08.833 --> 22:10.333
Go! Fuck! Fuck!

22:10.916 --> 22:12.208
Go, go, go, go, go!

22:14.333 --> 22:16.083
Why? Why did you do that?

22:16.166 --> 22:17.833
Truth to power, bitch! Drive!

22:18.625 --> 22:19.458
Why?

22:29.291 --> 22:31.750
Drive. If he gets close enough,
you're just as fucked as I am.

22:31.833 --> 22:34.958
You slow down, you die. That's metal.

22:35.041 --> 22:37.333
That is a dumb Keanu Reeves movie!

22:41.208 --> 22:42.416
Oh, shit.

22:45.208 --> 22:47.250
Watch out. He'll see you in the mirrors
if he gets close enough.

22:48.166 --> 22:50.291
What am I doing? Oh, God!

22:52.708 --> 22:54.541
You're an asshole.

23:03.291 --> 23:04.833
Okay. We can shake him.

23:04.916 --> 23:06.583
-Turn left on Aspen.

23:13.125 --> 23:14.125
Oh.

23:17.666 --> 23:20.166
-Don't slow down. Keep going straight.
-To where? Where?

23:20.250 --> 23:22.916
-There!
-I… We will not fit in there!

23:23.000 --> 23:24.125
I know this car!

23:24.916 --> 23:26.458
-Fucking do it!

23:26.541 --> 23:28.166
-Whoo!

23:28.250 --> 23:29.958
-No, no, no!
-Whoo!

23:34.458 --> 23:35.708
Oh, fuck!

23:35.791 --> 23:38.208
-Oh, shit.

23:38.291 --> 23:39.458
Whoa!

23:39.541 --> 23:41.916
Fuck you! Fuck you!

23:50.958 --> 23:51.791
Dude.

24:00.166 --> 24:01.625
<i> I understand now.</i>

24:01.708 --> 24:03.041
<i>Metal is commitment,</i>

24:03.125 --> 24:06.500
<i>and speaking truth to power,</i>
<i>and sticking it to the man, and speed.</i>

24:06.583 --> 24:08.083
That was fucking awesome.

24:09.208 --> 24:11.083
<i> Metal is taking the wheel.</i>

24:12.833 --> 24:13.666
What's this?

24:14.875 --> 24:17.250
-Homework.

24:17.875 --> 24:18.708
Black Sabbath.

24:20.125 --> 24:21.208
Iron Maiden.

24:22.708 --> 24:23.958
Judas Priest.

24:25.333 --> 24:26.333
Metallica.

24:26.916 --> 24:28.125
Anthrax.

24:28.208 --> 24:29.125
Slayer.

24:29.625 --> 24:30.583
Megadeth.

24:30.666 --> 24:31.500
Motörhead.

24:31.583 --> 24:32.875
Guns N' Roses.

24:32.958 --> 24:34.583
Rage Against the Machine.

24:34.666 --> 24:36.041
Pantera.

24:36.125 --> 24:38.625
Emperor. Tool. Dio.

24:38.708 --> 24:40.875
Meshuggah. Opeth. Slipknot.

24:40.958 --> 24:42.625
Mastodon. Lamb of God.

24:42.708 --> 24:44.208
This is your history now.

24:44.708 --> 24:46.500
Learn it. Live it.

24:47.416 --> 24:49.000
Do lines of it in the bathroom.

24:52.875 --> 24:54.125
I'll be working on this.

24:54.208 --> 24:56.000
It's the solo to "Machinery."

24:56.083 --> 24:57.250
It fucking shreds.

24:59.250 --> 25:01.250
-I had these made up.

25:02.833 --> 25:03.666
For luck.

25:06.833 --> 25:08.416
I'll get to work on this, then.

25:19.791 --> 25:20.958
Cocks.

25:23.791 --> 25:25.333
Fuck me, okay.

26:41.708 --> 26:42.541
Ah!

26:44.791 --> 26:45.666
Fuck.

29:20.083 --> 29:21.041
Hey. Um…

29:21.625 --> 29:23.666
Hi.

30:28.208 --> 30:29.750
<i>Man, she's amazing.</i>

30:30.833 --> 30:33.916
<i>Maybe Hunter'll change his mind about her</i>
<i>when I tell him how much she shreds.</i>

30:34.000 --> 30:36.500
…enunciation and projection.

30:37.000 --> 30:42.041
These are two of the most important tools
in your communications toolbox.

30:42.833 --> 30:47.500
Enunciation is the way we shape
the sounds that come out of our mouths.

30:49.291 --> 30:50.333
Uh…

30:51.000 --> 30:53.875
Dean Swanson
wants to see Hunter Sylvester.

31:30.083 --> 31:32.375
They only got
suspended two weeks.

31:32.458 --> 31:35.250
Swanson wanted a month,
but their ass-rapist coach intervened.

31:35.333 --> 31:37.000
Yeah, still, they're gone.

31:37.083 --> 31:38.833
They can't come back
to campus or anything.

31:38.916 --> 31:40.916
But when they come back,
they'll totally ass-rape me

31:41.000 --> 31:42.750
for getting them suspended
in the first place.

31:42.833 --> 31:44.708
Getting them suspended? It's their fault.

31:44.791 --> 31:45.833
They defaced your hair.

31:45.916 --> 31:47.416
I flicked him in the chops first.

31:47.500 --> 31:49.458
Okay, well, at Clay Moss's party,

31:49.541 --> 31:51.666
they pushed you into the speaker
in front of everybody.

31:51.750 --> 31:52.625
They started it.

31:52.708 --> 31:56.375
Yeah, I don't think
your average suburban Nazi shitbag

31:56.458 --> 31:57.458
is gonna see it that way.

32:03.833 --> 32:04.666
How is it?

32:07.291 --> 32:09.125
It's cool. Yeah, it's cool. Yeah.

32:09.208 --> 32:10.041
Yeah.

32:10.541 --> 32:14.000
Yeah, I kind of look like Jason Newsted
from Metallica, the bass player.

32:14.500 --> 32:15.333
Hmm.

32:16.125 --> 32:17.791
Oh, right, the one who got fired.

32:20.250 --> 32:22.458
It's more Viking than Newsted.

32:22.541 --> 32:24.416
Yeah, like the school mascot.

32:25.416 --> 32:27.375
No. No, not like the school mascot.

32:27.458 --> 32:29.416
Less like the school mascot
than anything on Earth.

32:29.500 --> 32:31.333
More like a baby's dick
than the school mascot.

32:31.416 --> 32:34.375
If a baby's dick grew its own baby dick,
then my hair would be more like--

33:53.083 --> 33:55.583
Sorry I'm so late.
Glad you guys are still here.

33:56.208 --> 33:57.583
No… No problem.

33:57.666 --> 33:59.166
No, yeah, not at all.

33:59.250 --> 34:01.541
Uh… Yeah. Um, so…

34:02.250 --> 34:03.083
Um…

34:03.875 --> 34:04.791
What do you know?

34:04.875 --> 34:08.083
Well, how about you guys start playing
and I'll work my way in.

34:09.500 --> 34:10.333
Cool.

34:11.791 --> 34:12.625
Um…

34:13.791 --> 34:15.500
How far have you gone in the… the thing--

34:15.583 --> 34:18.541
Yeah. I… I got through Metallica,
Judas Priest.

34:18.625 --> 34:21.666
I'm in the middle of Slayer right now
and I'm having a little bit of trouble--

34:21.750 --> 34:23.916
Okay. Okay. Let's try, uh…

34:24.500 --> 34:26.958
Let's try "For Whom the Bell Tolls."
Okay? You got it, Kev?

34:27.833 --> 34:29.000
Yeah, okay.

34:30.416 --> 34:33.041
One, two, three, four. One, two.

35:03.041 --> 35:05.000
Yeah. Okay, cool. All right, man.

35:08.000 --> 35:08.833
Let's…

35:09.583 --> 35:12.125
That was cool.
Le-- Um, let's try playing the song.

35:12.208 --> 35:13.291
Let's try playing the song,

35:13.375 --> 35:15.291
and we can see
how we vibe together as a band,

35:15.375 --> 35:20.000
and then we'll work on
all the stage-show elements later.

35:20.750 --> 35:22.083
Right. Cool.

35:24.041 --> 35:27.208
-Two, three, four.

35:49.625 --> 35:50.500
I just--

35:50.583 --> 35:54.583
Um, I'm, like, kind of getting confused,
'cause I just don't know what else to do.

35:54.666 --> 35:57.541
Dude, you can play,
or you can be wasted,

35:57.625 --> 35:59.541
but you can't play wasted.
It's not working out.

35:59.625 --> 36:02.000
We don't need a bass player
to beat those stooges.

36:02.500 --> 36:03.708
Just keep it us two.

36:04.291 --> 36:07.541
Okay. Like, uh… White Stripes.

36:07.625 --> 36:10.416
Weak. No, here, check this out.

36:11.125 --> 36:12.541
It's just two guys.

36:15.958 --> 36:19.375
It means that we wouldn't have to split
our contest winnings three ways…

36:20.625 --> 36:22.166
Something to consider.

36:56.833 --> 36:57.916
That's mean.

36:59.125 --> 37:00.000
Yeah, it is.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.083
<i>It doesn't feel</i>
<i>like a good time</i> <i>to tell Hunter</i>

37:05.166 --> 37:08.083
<i>that I don't wanna be in a band</i>
<i>that sounds like people being tortured.</i>

37:08.166 --> 37:12.166
<i>But I think it's time for him to seriously</i>
<i>consider the only good option we have.</i>

37:12.250 --> 37:13.666
<i>No, it's a great option.</i>

37:14.333 --> 37:16.625
<i>It is time to speak truth to power.</i>

37:16.708 --> 37:20.583
We have, like, two weeks,
and she can learn everything in two days.

37:20.666 --> 37:22.375
It's nothing personal, Emily.

37:22.458 --> 37:25.916
It's just you're not consistent
with the image we're trying to project…

37:27.541 --> 37:28.916
like I told Kevin.

37:30.666 --> 37:31.791
Is it because she's a girl?

37:32.666 --> 37:33.625
No.

37:33.708 --> 37:37.000
Well… what about Joan Jett?

37:37.500 --> 37:39.083
Doesn't she rock?

37:39.708 --> 37:41.750
Um, the-- What about The Runaways?

37:41.833 --> 37:42.875
That's Joan Jett.

37:42.958 --> 37:46.291
-Okay. Well, there's Lita Ford.
-That's The Runaways.

37:46.375 --> 37:47.458
And there's, um…

37:47.541 --> 37:49.541
There's, uh… What's her-- Um…

37:50.125 --> 37:51.791
-Kevin.
-Uh, what-- what's…

37:51.875 --> 37:53.541
-What's the one with the song…
-Kevin.

37:53.625 --> 37:55.625
Kevin. Kevin. Kevin. Kevin.

37:55.708 --> 37:56.916
Kevin, we are a metal band.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.666
We are not an indie metal band.
We are not an alt-metal band.

37:59.750 --> 38:02.083
We are not a sort of metal band.
We are a metal band.

38:02.166 --> 38:05.541
And for us to have a cello player
instead of a bass player

38:05.625 --> 38:06.916
would be completely gay.

38:07.000 --> 38:09.083
-Uh…

38:24.708 --> 38:26.625
You've gotta take all that in context.

38:27.208 --> 38:28.416
Gay?

38:28.500 --> 38:31.333
Gay? Our band is called Skullfucker.

38:31.416 --> 38:32.791
Skullfucker.

38:32.875 --> 38:34.958
You named it that to impress girls?

38:35.041 --> 38:37.416
We're gonna die virgins
in a band called Skullfucker.

38:42.000 --> 38:43.458
What I meant was, we're not--

38:43.541 --> 38:45.500
Oh, come on. Like she didn't know.

38:59.583 --> 39:00.416
Hello?

39:00.500 --> 39:03.000
<i>-Hey. It's Kevin.</i>
-Oh.

39:03.583 --> 39:04.458
<i> Hey.</i>

39:06.375 --> 39:09.916
Uh, hey, I… wanted to apologize

39:10.000 --> 39:13.083
<i>again for Hunter being so rude, and…</i>

39:13.875 --> 39:16.250
<i>-That stuff he said. He--</i>
It's okay.

39:17.208 --> 39:18.541
I'm one too.

39:19.291 --> 39:20.291
Hm?

39:20.875 --> 39:22.416
A virgin.

39:23.250 --> 39:24.625
I know, it's a shocker.

39:25.208 --> 39:26.458
Oh, um… Uh, no,

39:26.541 --> 39:31.458
I was talking about that stuff
he said about girl cello players

39:31.541 --> 39:33.125
<i>in a metal band being gay.</i>

39:33.208 --> 39:34.708
Right. Sorry. Eh…

39:34.791 --> 39:36.833
<i>First of all,</i>
<i>that's a totally messed up thing to say.</i>

39:36.916 --> 39:38.041
Well, maybe he's right.

39:38.125 --> 39:41.375
No, he's not, and…you're not.

39:41.458 --> 39:42.375
<i>Not what?</i>

39:42.458 --> 39:45.958
Are we talking gayness,
or heavy metal, or virginity?

39:46.875 --> 39:47.875
Uh, um…

39:49.041 --> 39:50.416
All of them, I think. Uh…

39:51.083 --> 39:53.041
They seem related.

39:54.416 --> 39:56.416
You are, right?

39:56.500 --> 39:58.000
Gay? I don't think so.

39:58.083 --> 39:59.833
<i>I guess there's sort of a spectrum.</i>

39:59.916 --> 40:00.750
A virgin.

40:03.625 --> 40:04.625
Oh, um…

40:06.541 --> 40:08.083
Yes, definitely.

40:09.750 --> 40:10.583
Hm…

40:10.666 --> 40:14.458
Do… you want to?

40:15.500 --> 40:16.583
To…

40:19.750 --> 40:21.500
Do you want to not be?

40:24.916 --> 40:26.125
I, uh…

40:27.125 --> 40:29.083
Y-- yes.

40:29.166 --> 40:31.291
Uh, um… Uh, do you?

40:31.958 --> 40:34.958
-You know where Temple Solel is?
-On Cleavy? Yeah.

40:35.041 --> 40:37.625
<i>Will you meet me</i>
<i>in the car park in a half hour?</i>

40:37.708 --> 40:39.708
Oh, and can you bring thingies?

40:41.791 --> 40:42.875
For your thingy?

40:47.125 --> 40:48.333
Hey, Mom. Uh…

40:49.291 --> 40:50.875
-I need the car.
-Okay.

40:50.958 --> 40:54.833
Well, your father should be back
from the shop around 8:00.

40:54.916 --> 40:56.875
-And then we--
-Mom, I need the car.

42:02.750 --> 42:03.750
Fucking…

42:18.500 --> 42:20.666
-I know. I know.

42:20.750 --> 42:22.625
-We said 6:15.

42:23.500 --> 42:24.791
It is now 8:00.

42:24.875 --> 42:27.000
-Well, something came up.
-What?

42:27.583 --> 42:28.750
What came up?

42:33.541 --> 42:34.375
Nothing.

42:34.458 --> 42:36.541
I thought it was something.
You said it was something.

42:36.625 --> 42:39.125
Well, I was wrong. It was nothing.

42:39.791 --> 42:43.625
I can imagine something
being more important than a band practice.

42:44.375 --> 42:45.791
Actually, I can't.

42:45.875 --> 42:49.291
But I definitely can't see how nothing
could be more important, Kevin.

42:49.375 --> 42:51.583
Well, nothing
is more important.

42:51.666 --> 42:54.291
Or nothing isn't more important.

42:54.375 --> 42:55.208
What I mean--

42:55.291 --> 42:57.375
I don't need Abbott and Costello
from you, okay?

42:57.458 --> 42:59.541
I need a drummer. A real drummer.

43:00.166 --> 43:02.708
Metal is commitment, Kevin.

43:02.791 --> 43:04.708
It's dedication, sacrifice,

43:04.791 --> 43:07.208
mortification of the flesh
and all that shit.

43:07.291 --> 43:08.291
It's serious.

43:08.375 --> 43:09.666
And if you're not gonna be,

43:09.750 --> 43:12.583
if you'll be all "girls with cello,
showing up whenever I feel like it,"

43:12.666 --> 43:13.916
then this isn't gonna work.

43:14.000 --> 43:15.750
And we won't win the Battle of the Bands,

43:15.833 --> 43:18.750
and then you're gonna be a loser
for the rest of your life.

43:53.333 --> 43:54.166
Hey.

43:56.958 --> 43:57.791
Hey!

43:58.375 --> 43:59.958
-Hey!
-Oh, hey.

44:02.791 --> 44:03.750
Hi.

44:03.833 --> 44:05.458
Where did you learn how to play?

44:05.541 --> 44:06.541
Uh…

44:06.625 --> 44:07.458
I don't know.

44:07.541 --> 44:10.791
My friend just gave me these songs,
and I practiced them.

44:11.666 --> 44:14.041
I'm not, you know,
a real drummer or anything.

44:14.125 --> 44:15.583
Are you fucking high?

44:16.083 --> 44:17.458
That was intense.

44:19.125 --> 44:20.041
Yeah?

44:20.666 --> 44:22.000
Have you got a minute?

44:34.041 --> 44:37.916
Are they all like this? Just pretty much
the same beat all the way through?

44:38.000 --> 44:39.083
-Yeah.
-Pretty much.

44:39.166 --> 44:43.708
Please, Kevin. I promised my sister,
and she's so psyched to have us play.

44:43.791 --> 44:46.500
But Ray's not getting out of rehab
for another month,

44:46.583 --> 44:49.291
and we're tired of playing
with a wasted drummer.

44:49.375 --> 44:51.166
-Yeah, man.
- Fuck that dummy.

44:51.250 --> 44:52.708
I would like to,

44:52.791 --> 44:55.750
but it's like I said,
I'm in this band with Hunter,

44:55.833 --> 44:58.958
and Battle of the Bands
is really important to him.

44:59.041 --> 45:02.250
-Lots of guys are in two bands.
-Eric Clapton was in, like, 60 bands.

45:02.333 --> 45:03.916
And I heard you play, man.

45:04.458 --> 45:06.666
You could learn our songs in ten minutes.

45:08.000 --> 45:10.625
Don't even worry
about the Battle of the Bands for now,

45:10.708 --> 45:12.083
just my sister's wedding.

45:14.416 --> 45:16.583
-Let me think about it.
-I feel you.

45:17.083 --> 45:18.791
But the wedding's this weekend,

45:19.750 --> 45:21.250
<i>so don't think too long.</i>

45:30.291 --> 45:31.791
-Fuck.

45:31.875 --> 45:32.708
You blinked.

45:33.208 --> 45:34.791
-I blunk.
-You blunk.

45:36.791 --> 45:37.875
Three out of five?

45:39.208 --> 45:41.625
I'm pretty sure
you're better at staring than me.

45:41.708 --> 45:42.583
Mm-hmm.

45:47.000 --> 45:48.250
Those your meds?

45:48.958 --> 45:49.833
Mm-hmm.

45:50.583 --> 45:52.166
My happy pills.

45:55.083 --> 45:57.333
-Don't you need more?

45:57.416 --> 45:58.250
Mm-mm.

46:06.333 --> 46:07.666
Lay on top of me.

46:23.000 --> 46:23.833
Not yet.

46:26.291 --> 46:27.291
Let's just, um,

46:28.500 --> 46:29.500
lie like this.

46:30.666 --> 46:31.500
I like it.

46:32.791 --> 46:35.875
Makes me feel… smooshed.

46:41.166 --> 46:43.791
On the field, when I first saw you…

46:44.291 --> 46:45.125
Yeah.

46:46.500 --> 46:49.416
…did it feel… good to

46:50.208 --> 46:52.166
throw stuff and yell at people?

46:56.875 --> 46:57.708
No.

46:59.916 --> 47:04.541
Feels good to not want to throw stuff
and yell at people.

47:08.416 --> 47:09.666
You're my happy pill.

47:17.333 --> 47:18.333
Mm.

47:26.583 --> 47:27.833
It's only a wedding.

47:28.875 --> 47:31.958
Look, you've got to understand something,
Kevin. We don't fit in.

47:32.041 --> 47:35.208
You can try as hard as you want.
You can get yourself a girlfriend,

47:35.291 --> 47:36.875
or whatever, but you still won't fit in.

47:36.958 --> 47:40.291
She doesn't fit in either.
Why can't we all not fit in together?

47:40.375 --> 47:42.833
We're not talking about that now.
I don't even wanna go there.

47:42.916 --> 47:44.500
We're talking about you being a traitor--

47:44.583 --> 47:45.708
Maybe I wanna talk about it.

47:45.791 --> 47:48.750
I'm the founding member of Skullfucker,
and I say no Yokos.

47:48.833 --> 47:49.958
You said "fuck."

47:50.041 --> 47:51.875
We are both founding members
of Skullfucker.

47:51.958 --> 47:53.500
-Don't!
-I am way more founding.

47:53.583 --> 47:55.916
I write songs, buy equipment,
designed our Facebook page--

47:56.000 --> 47:57.041
Oh, fuck our Facebook page!

47:57.125 --> 47:59.375
I'm the founding member of Skullfucker,
and I say no Yokos!

47:59.458 --> 48:01.000
-No more fuck!
-Shut up!

48:01.083 --> 48:02.291
End of conversation.

48:02.375 --> 48:05.208
No, you-- No. You can't just declare
end of conversation.

48:05.291 --> 48:06.458
You don't have that authority.

48:10.541 --> 48:11.875
Fine, end of conversation.

48:18.000 --> 48:20.333
And that is how you knit a sweater.

48:21.708 --> 48:23.583
Very good, Andrea.

48:24.083 --> 48:27.750
Did you hear
how she enunciated and projected?

48:28.250 --> 48:30.041
Get her all the way in the back, right?

48:30.625 --> 48:32.375
And now, Hunter.

48:36.750 --> 48:38.750
<i>"Death closes all</i>

48:39.625 --> 48:41.916
<i>But something ere the end</i>

48:42.000 --> 48:44.666
<i>Some work of noble note</i>

48:44.750 --> 48:45.916
<i>May yet be done</i>

48:47.416 --> 48:50.791
<i>Not unbecoming men that strove with gods."</i>

48:54.791 --> 48:55.875
Tennyson's "Ulysses."

48:55.958 --> 48:57.875
You might know it from your English class.

49:00.125 --> 49:01.791
This speech is about metal.

49:10.333 --> 49:12.708
Metal is about what "Ulysses" was about.

49:12.791 --> 49:14.750
Striving with gods.

49:14.833 --> 49:17.750
Striking out for unknown territory.

49:18.250 --> 49:21.000
The people that crossed the Bering Strait
12,000 years ago?

49:25.791 --> 49:26.625
Metal.

49:27.250 --> 49:29.250
That Kon-Tiki guy?

49:34.041 --> 49:34.875
Metal.

49:35.625 --> 49:38.166
The people on the Mayflower…

49:38.666 --> 49:41.041
…would've been metal
if it weren't for all the Jesus crap.

49:41.625 --> 49:43.333
And Ulysses, what did he do?

49:43.416 --> 49:44.250
Huh?

49:45.958 --> 49:48.125
Read Dante. He'll tell you.

49:49.208 --> 49:52.708
Ulysses got together
the baddest ass crew he could find,

49:52.791 --> 49:55.958
and then he sailed off
beyond the Pillars of Hercules,

49:56.041 --> 49:58.250
and then he was drowned,

49:58.750 --> 50:02.500
and pulled right down to hell.

50:10.500 --> 50:11.541
Eighth circle.

50:11.625 --> 50:14.208
What is more metal than that?

50:14.958 --> 50:16.291
Only the ninth circle.

50:18.208 --> 50:22.875
So… achieving your dreams
with fellow badasses,

50:22.958 --> 50:25.375
going to hell if you have to…

50:26.375 --> 50:28.125
Oh, that sounds great, right?

50:29.208 --> 50:31.458
But it wasn't so easy for Ulysses.

50:33.041 --> 50:34.166
See, he had, um…

50:35.791 --> 50:36.750
He had Penelope,

50:38.208 --> 50:41.166
Mrs. Ulysses, keeping him down.

50:43.375 --> 50:45.041
"Stay home."

50:45.666 --> 50:46.708
"Be king."

50:47.916 --> 50:50.541
"Go to work every day."

50:51.916 --> 50:56.000
He wasted decades of his life
on that shit.

50:56.083 --> 50:57.416
-Hunter.

50:57.500 --> 50:59.250
-Stop it.

50:59.333 --> 51:02.833
But one day, Ulysses decided
he was finished with his woman.

51:02.916 --> 51:04.416
Hunter, that's enough!

51:04.500 --> 51:05.875
It was inevitable.

51:05.958 --> 51:09.291
Sooner or later, the metal inside him
was bound to rise up…

51:09.375 --> 51:12.333
…and crush
whatever stood in its path!

51:12.416 --> 51:14.625
-Fucker! Fucking cunt!
-You're fucking crazy!

51:14.708 --> 51:16.916
I'll fucking-- I will fucking kill you!

51:17.000 --> 51:19.041
-Don't you ever come near me again!
-Ow!

51:20.291 --> 51:22.208
-Not the guitar!

51:24.208 --> 51:27.375
That was inappropriate,
bordering on inexcusable.

51:27.458 --> 51:28.666
I completely agree.

51:28.750 --> 51:30.000
I'm talking about you.

51:31.083 --> 51:31.916
Wait, what?

51:32.000 --> 51:34.458
Is that what you've learned
from your interactions

51:34.541 --> 51:36.958
with the vicious morons like Skip Hoffman?

51:37.833 --> 51:39.583
How to torment people weaker than you?

51:39.666 --> 51:41.791
Look, I've got
some personal issues with her--

51:41.875 --> 51:45.625
I could give a shit about
your personal issues with that poor girl.

51:47.125 --> 51:49.666
You're going to write down
exactly what you did.

51:50.250 --> 51:52.375
If Miss Johnson corroborates your account,

51:52.458 --> 51:55.625
I'll include it in the disciplinary notice
I'll send to your father.

51:55.708 --> 51:59.000
If she doesn't, I will suspend you.

52:26.250 --> 52:27.833
Your friend's a massive dick.

52:33.958 --> 52:35.208
What the fuck?

52:37.750 --> 52:38.916
The fuck you doing?

52:39.416 --> 52:44.583
You are afraid of everybody,
and instead of showing it like I do,

52:44.666 --> 52:48.041
you treat everybody like shit
and you make them hate you.

52:48.125 --> 52:50.708
Great. They leave you alone,
they leave me alone.

52:50.791 --> 52:53.458
Both of us are alone.
Mission accomplished.

52:53.541 --> 52:54.875
-No, no, no--
-No, shut up.

52:55.500 --> 52:57.833
You need me a lot more than I need you.

52:59.375 --> 53:02.250
Without me,
all of your dumb fantasies disappear.

53:02.833 --> 53:05.333
But without you,
I might actually live a real life.

53:08.041 --> 53:10.333
You… You can't.

53:10.416 --> 53:11.291
You can't.

53:14.875 --> 53:16.083
We're Skullfucker.

53:25.250 --> 53:28.041
Fine. Fine. Go enjoy
your new fucking wacko girlfriend

53:28.125 --> 53:30.375
and your new---
and your new shitty band and--

53:30.958 --> 53:32.583
And<i> Rock of Ages!</i>

53:33.541 --> 53:34.500
It's my fault.

53:35.083 --> 53:37.208
It's Hunter's fault. He's a massive dick.

53:37.291 --> 53:38.875
But I never would've lost it like that

53:38.958 --> 53:42.000
-if I hadn't stopped taking my meds.
-It was not your fault! Wh--

53:47.833 --> 53:48.916
No, don't…

53:51.958 --> 53:53.625
-I'm not mad.

53:55.666 --> 53:58.583
You didn't do anything wrong.
There's nothing wrong with you.

53:58.666 --> 53:59.708
Yeah, there is.

54:00.291 --> 54:03.708
The concentration of serotonin
in my synapses is too low.

54:05.416 --> 54:09.375
Okay, but there's something more wrong
with everyone else.

54:10.958 --> 54:14.083
You have a right to be mad,
especially at Hunter.

54:14.166 --> 54:16.625
Why am I like this?

54:18.833 --> 54:21.583
Everybody else
didn't make me like this.

54:23.250 --> 54:25.208
Hunter didn't make me like this.

54:25.708 --> 54:27.916
-My parents love me.

54:28.875 --> 54:30.833
They try as hard as they can.

54:33.041 --> 54:34.708
Nah, not their fault.

54:35.541 --> 54:37.041
You're not anybody's fault.

54:37.125 --> 54:38.208
Huh.

54:38.291 --> 54:39.333
You're not…

54:41.666 --> 54:42.500
a fault.

54:42.583 --> 54:43.416
You--

54:49.291 --> 54:52.708
There may be something…
wrong with you, but…

54:56.416 --> 54:57.375
you're perfect.

55:20.583 --> 55:21.750
You ever get angry?

55:22.916 --> 55:23.875
Sometimes.

55:29.416 --> 55:30.250
I get it.

55:30.958 --> 55:33.791
Sometimes… also sad.

55:39.875 --> 55:40.791
You know why?

55:41.958 --> 55:43.000
I don't know.

55:44.916 --> 55:47.541
It's because people treat you
like you're invisible.

55:49.416 --> 55:51.250
Like you're not even there.

55:51.333 --> 55:52.500
Like you're nothing.

55:54.500 --> 55:56.500
But you're more than that.
You're better than that.

55:56.583 --> 55:58.791
You're not nothing. You're something.

56:00.000 --> 56:01.166
You're somebody.

56:02.166 --> 56:03.041
I'm Robbie.

56:04.416 --> 56:05.583
Fuck yeah, you are.

56:14.958 --> 56:16.750
We're done taking shit, you and me.

57:18.625 --> 57:20.958
Take off the costume, Krusty the Clown.

57:21.041 --> 57:24.375
We gotta talk about this, uh, "What I did
at school today" essay right here.

57:24.458 --> 57:27.625
Sorry, you're just a little late
with the whole parenting thing.

57:28.458 --> 57:29.833
Get back inside!

57:29.916 --> 57:31.625
Go bang another nurse!

57:38.750 --> 57:39.833
Fuck.

59:02.416 --> 59:03.916
This is private property.

59:05.166 --> 59:06.500
My drummer's in there.

59:07.041 --> 59:08.208
I'm going in.

59:08.291 --> 59:10.333
No, you ain't. Get the hell out of here.

59:11.041 --> 59:12.375
Who are you

59:13.083 --> 59:14.875
to stop a man

59:15.541 --> 59:17.708
who strives with gods?

59:29.750 --> 59:32.291
That was great, brother.
Really great.

59:32.375 --> 59:33.708
Yeah, it was fun.

59:33.791 --> 59:37.000
You killed that shit. We never sounded
anything like that before.

59:37.083 --> 59:38.958
I want you to know, man, if…

59:39.458 --> 59:41.541
If you wanna play with us
at the Battle of the Bands,

59:41.625 --> 59:43.041
we would love to have you.

59:43.875 --> 59:45.416
Or even if you don't.

59:45.500 --> 59:48.708
I mean, if you just wanna hang,
it's… It's all good.

59:49.458 --> 59:50.291
Thanks.

59:50.958 --> 59:53.125
Yeah, I might take you up
on both of those.

59:54.208 --> 59:55.083
Respect.

59:57.625 --> 59:59.125
Wanna come hang with the other dudes?

59:59.208 --> 1:00:00.375
Yeah. Yes.

1:00:00.458 --> 1:00:02.416
Let me just finish up here.

1:00:14.958 --> 1:00:16.458
You're lucky they didn't press charges.

1:00:16.541 --> 1:00:18.125
I want my stuff back.

1:00:18.208 --> 1:00:21.208
Weapons confiscated from a minor
at the time of an arrest

1:00:21.291 --> 1:00:23.250
shall be considered forfeit
to the township.

1:00:28.041 --> 1:00:30.416
This is the last straw. No, wait.

1:00:30.500 --> 1:00:31.708
No.

1:00:31.791 --> 1:00:34.166
This is the last straw.

1:00:35.625 --> 1:00:37.708
Mm? Right there.

1:00:44.333 --> 1:00:46.458
-What are you gonna do?

1:00:56.833 --> 1:00:57.666
Listen, look.

1:00:57.750 --> 1:01:00.333
-The Battle of the Bands is on Friday--
-Not for you it ain't!

1:01:09.666 --> 1:01:10.500
Let's go.

1:01:11.583 --> 1:01:13.083
-Go, go, go.

1:01:20.708 --> 1:01:21.541
Hey!

1:01:23.125 --> 1:01:24.333
Drummer boy!

1:01:27.125 --> 1:01:27.958
I…

1:01:29.500 --> 1:01:31.166
I don't have a bathing suit.

1:01:50.458 --> 1:01:53.291
Every time I see you, you are wasted.

1:01:53.375 --> 1:01:54.208
Yeah.

1:01:55.208 --> 1:01:56.833
Hey, let me try your glasses.

1:02:03.166 --> 1:02:04.208
I like these.

1:02:04.708 --> 1:02:07.791
I saw Timothée Chalamet
wearing glasses like this on Insta once.

1:02:07.875 --> 1:02:09.791
I like <i>Call Me by Your Name.</i>

1:02:09.875 --> 1:02:11.500
It's so sweet, right?

1:02:11.583 --> 1:02:13.500
He's so hot in that.

1:02:13.583 --> 1:02:16.250
My cousin in Santa Barbara
totally fucked him.

1:02:21.375 --> 1:02:23.375
You're staring at me again.

1:02:23.458 --> 1:02:24.291
Uh…

1:02:25.125 --> 1:02:26.500
I can't even see you.

1:02:26.583 --> 1:02:29.250
Hmm. Yeah.
Well, I don't even know your name.

1:02:29.875 --> 1:02:30.833
It's Kevin.

1:02:32.333 --> 1:02:33.208
Kendall.

1:02:44.583 --> 1:02:45.541
See me now?

1:02:51.875 --> 1:02:54.958
Yo, dude.
What, are you waiting for a tutorial?

1:02:55.875 --> 1:02:59.833
Come on, man. What about Emily?
They've got a real relationship.

1:02:59.916 --> 1:03:02.208
One built on trust and emotional honesty.

1:03:02.291 --> 1:03:05.666
And this? I mean, come on, dude.
What's really going on here?

1:03:05.750 --> 1:03:08.750
Hold on, Tom. Kendall's a person too.

1:03:08.833 --> 1:03:11.750
She likes Kevin.
She's making her desires known.

1:03:11.833 --> 1:03:13.750
There's absolutely nothing wrong
with that.

1:03:13.833 --> 1:03:17.000
Yeah, maybe, but Emily's really loyal.
This would ruin her.

1:03:17.083 --> 1:03:18.833
Back in the day, we all got up to stuff.

1:03:18.916 --> 1:03:21.208
He's only a drummer.
He should have what he wants.

1:03:21.291 --> 1:03:23.250
If he's in that hot tub,
he'll have what he gets.

1:03:23.333 --> 1:03:25.541
<i>A year ago,</i>
<i>I didn't know who these guys were.</i>

1:03:25.625 --> 1:03:27.416
<i>But now, after a bottle of champagne,</i>

1:03:27.500 --> 1:03:29.166
<i>they're all making</i>
<i>some really good points.</i>

1:03:29.250 --> 1:03:30.208
Oy.

1:03:31.208 --> 1:03:32.083
Oy!

1:03:32.666 --> 1:03:34.333
You found someone who loves you.

1:03:35.083 --> 1:03:36.125
Do you love her back?

1:03:36.958 --> 1:03:38.000
Uh-huh.

1:03:38.083 --> 1:03:40.083
Then, don't be an asshole, Kevin.

1:03:44.833 --> 1:03:45.708
I'm sorry.

1:03:46.458 --> 1:03:47.458
I have to go.

1:03:49.291 --> 1:03:50.541
I have a girlfriend.

1:03:57.166 --> 1:03:59.041
<i>Thank you,</i>
<i>Rob Halford of Judas Priest.</i>

1:04:00.541 --> 1:04:02.875
<i>You don't turn your back</i>
<i>on the people who love you.</i>

1:04:13.833 --> 1:04:14.958
I'm gonna get this.

1:04:16.708 --> 1:04:17.666
You don't have to.

1:04:17.750 --> 1:04:18.791
I want to.

1:04:26.666 --> 1:04:28.666
Oh. Here it is.

1:04:31.500 --> 1:04:35.500
I've been looking for this
for, like, forever.

1:04:36.875 --> 1:04:38.583
-I should have it.
-What?

1:04:40.041 --> 1:04:41.833
-I found it.
-What? Give me that.

1:04:45.500 --> 1:04:48.250
You wouldn't even know
about Lamb of God if it wasn't for me?

1:04:53.500 --> 1:04:54.416
Cunt.

1:05:43.791 --> 1:05:45.625
Listen, I've got to get out
of here immediately.

1:05:45.708 --> 1:05:46.750
I've got this important--

1:05:46.833 --> 1:05:49.708
We are doing
a preliminary eval on you, right?

1:05:49.791 --> 1:05:52.083
Let's get started.

1:05:52.166 --> 1:05:53.250
I'm Dr. Nix.

1:06:00.041 --> 1:06:01.208
Troy Nix?

1:06:01.291 --> 1:06:02.125
Yeah.

1:06:04.041 --> 1:06:05.333
The Troy Nix?

1:06:07.666 --> 1:06:08.625
From Kiloton?

1:06:11.125 --> 1:06:12.583
Yeah, that's right.

1:06:15.291 --> 1:06:17.916
Dude. Dude, you guys were gods.

1:06:18.500 --> 1:06:21.375
-I-- I go to Glenwood Lake High, man.
-I see that.

1:06:21.875 --> 1:06:23.333
Hmm. My condolences.

1:06:24.666 --> 1:06:27.000
-So you're a doctor now?
-Yeah.

1:06:28.666 --> 1:06:30.041
Was an alcoholic.

1:06:30.125 --> 1:06:33.333
Place like this saved me
from a slow fucking suicide,

1:06:33.416 --> 1:06:35.416
so I went back to school, got my Psy D.

1:06:36.125 --> 1:06:38.458
Give something back, that kind of shit.

1:06:39.166 --> 1:06:40.333
What happened to Kiloton?

1:06:41.291 --> 1:06:42.625
My bandmates happened.

1:06:43.875 --> 1:06:47.125
They wouldn't practice,
wouldn't learn the songs.

1:06:47.208 --> 1:06:49.333
-So that's why you broke up?
-That was part of it.

1:06:49.416 --> 1:06:51.750
But mostly it was because
those guys were fuck-holes.

1:06:51.833 --> 1:06:53.625
They wouldn't go an inch
out of their own way

1:06:53.708 --> 1:06:55.083
for anybody but themselves.

1:06:56.416 --> 1:07:00.125
Look, if you're gonna record with people,
you're gonna tour with people,

1:07:00.208 --> 1:07:03.083
you're gonna spend all day, every day,
with them for years,

1:07:03.166 --> 1:07:05.125
you sure as shit
better like hanging out with them.

1:07:05.208 --> 1:07:07.166
Otherwise, your life is gonna suck.

1:07:07.250 --> 1:07:09.791
Then you're gonna start drinking
to forget how bad your life sucks,

1:07:09.875 --> 1:07:11.041
and before you know it…

1:07:14.416 --> 1:07:15.333
You a drinker?

1:07:17.083 --> 1:07:18.166
No.

1:07:18.250 --> 1:07:19.458
Drugs? Weed?

1:07:20.500 --> 1:07:21.333
-Coke?
-No.

1:07:21.416 --> 1:07:22.250
-Meth?
-No.

1:07:22.333 --> 1:07:24.083
-H?
-No.

1:07:24.166 --> 1:07:25.250
-Acid?
-No.

1:07:25.333 --> 1:07:26.541
-Molly?
-No.

1:07:26.625 --> 1:07:28.375
-You vaping?
-No.

1:07:28.458 --> 1:07:29.625
-Self-harm?
-No.

1:07:29.708 --> 1:07:31.666
-Sleep too much?
-No.

1:07:31.750 --> 1:07:33.166
-Too little?
-No.

1:07:33.250 --> 1:07:34.541
Suicidal ideation?

1:07:34.625 --> 1:07:36.541
-Did you destroy any property?

1:07:37.625 --> 1:07:38.916
Not that they know about.

1:07:40.083 --> 1:07:40.958
What, then?

1:07:43.958 --> 1:07:45.791
Just fucking metal, man.

1:07:51.541 --> 1:07:54.791
I get this kind of shit all the time.
Okay, come on.

1:07:56.333 --> 1:07:57.416
Up. Let's go.

1:08:02.208 --> 1:08:03.208
Yo, hold up.

1:08:03.750 --> 1:08:05.041
Where are you going?

1:08:05.125 --> 1:08:06.291
You're fine, dude.

1:08:07.583 --> 1:08:08.666
Now, this motherfucker…

1:08:09.833 --> 1:08:10.708
Hey.

1:08:11.375 --> 1:08:13.833
He's a mess.
He and I have a lot of work to do.

1:08:13.916 --> 1:08:17.958
Which is why I can't babysit your ass just
because you like brutal fucking music.

1:08:18.041 --> 1:08:20.000
I'm recommending you for discharge.

1:08:20.083 --> 1:08:23.208
The board will follow my recommendations.
They always do.

1:08:23.291 --> 1:08:26.333
-I scare the shit out of them.
-Thank you, man. Thank you.

1:08:26.416 --> 1:08:29.500
No problem.
We will have you out of here by Monday.

1:08:30.250 --> 1:08:31.375
Monday? Why Monday?

1:08:31.958 --> 1:08:33.958
They review recommendations
over the weekend.

1:08:34.666 --> 1:08:37.416
Okay. Um, is there any way
we could get that review done tonight?

1:08:37.500 --> 1:08:38.500
Nah, no way in hell.

1:08:38.583 --> 1:08:41.958
They're already driving home
in their Jaguars listening to Sting. Why?

1:08:42.041 --> 1:08:46.416
The Battle of the Bands is tomorrow,
and my band is totally poised to win.

1:08:46.500 --> 1:08:48.208
Okay, look, check it out.

1:08:48.291 --> 1:08:49.208
Hmm.

1:08:51.291 --> 1:08:52.291
Skullfucker.

1:08:52.958 --> 1:08:53.791
Nice.

1:08:54.916 --> 1:08:57.083
Fucking Battle of the motherfucking Bands.

1:09:04.500 --> 1:09:05.666
Sorry.

1:09:05.750 --> 1:09:07.875
Anyway, give you another year to practice.

1:09:09.166 --> 1:09:10.500
See you around, bitch.

1:09:22.666 --> 1:09:24.333
Nah. Thank you, man.

1:09:26.875 --> 1:09:27.708
Hey, Clay.

1:09:28.666 --> 1:09:31.208
Yeah, are we going to practice before?

1:09:33.291 --> 1:09:36.166
No? Okay. No. We don't need to. It's fine.

1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:40.875
Yeah, I'll see you
at 7:00 at the cafeteria.

1:09:40.958 --> 1:09:43.500
-All right. Thanks, Clay.

1:10:10.041 --> 1:10:12.583
<i>It's Hunter. I'm not here. Deal.</i>

1:10:13.083 --> 1:10:13.916
Fuck.

1:10:21.875 --> 1:10:24.458
Who the fuck calls on a landline?

1:10:25.875 --> 1:10:26.916
Hello?

1:10:28.708 --> 1:10:30.375
Oh, hey, Kevin. Uh…

1:10:30.458 --> 1:10:33.708
No, Hunter isn't here right now.

1:10:35.541 --> 1:10:37.208
He-- He what?

1:10:37.833 --> 1:10:38.833
So where is he?

1:10:43.250 --> 1:10:46.541
<i>I feel like this is his way</i>
<i>of begging me to come back to the band.</i>

1:10:46.625 --> 1:10:48.208
He doesn't belong in there.

1:10:49.250 --> 1:10:50.541
Maybe he does.

1:10:50.625 --> 1:10:53.916
There's definitely something wrong
with him. He's shitty to everyone.

1:10:54.000 --> 1:10:56.541
Even you.
You're supposed to be his best friend.

1:11:02.708 --> 1:11:05.250
You said it yourself, he's a massive dick.

1:11:06.250 --> 1:11:09.333
I would have never understood what
a massive dick he is if it wasn't for you.

1:11:10.041 --> 1:11:12.166
And I wouldn't have met you
if it wasn't for metal,

1:11:12.250 --> 1:11:16.583
and I wouldn't have thought about metal
for five seconds if it wasn't for Hunter.

1:11:17.291 --> 1:11:18.416
So you owe him?

1:11:20.416 --> 1:11:21.458
He's my best friend.

1:11:22.291 --> 1:11:23.750
I gotta get him out of there.

1:11:27.833 --> 1:11:29.250
Will you come with me?

1:11:30.541 --> 1:11:34.000
Wait, so first you tell me
that I should hate him,

1:11:34.083 --> 1:11:35.666
and now you want me to help him?

1:11:36.250 --> 1:11:39.750
Uh, you'd sort of be helping me help him.

1:11:42.291 --> 1:11:43.375
It's okay. It's okay.

1:11:43.458 --> 1:11:46.208
No, I can't!
Not after what he did.

1:11:46.291 --> 1:11:48.666
You don't have to. It's okay. I mean it.

1:11:50.416 --> 1:11:51.250
Okay?

1:11:53.833 --> 1:11:54.666
Okay.

1:11:56.500 --> 1:11:57.416
I have to go.

1:12:38.125 --> 1:12:39.125
Can I help you?

1:12:39.208 --> 1:12:41.708
Yeah. Yeah, I… I hope so.

1:12:42.583 --> 1:12:45.291
My best friend,
he's-- he's got problems. He's a, uh…

1:12:46.416 --> 1:12:47.416
A sniffer.

1:12:47.500 --> 1:12:48.625
Gasoline?

1:12:48.708 --> 1:12:51.500
-Turpentine, butane, propane?
-Yep, yep, yep, all those.

1:12:51.583 --> 1:12:54.458
He mixes them,
and his parents don't know what to do,

1:12:54.541 --> 1:12:58.208
so I wanted to get them a brochure.

1:12:58.291 --> 1:13:01.000
You're a good friend.
They're right back there.

1:13:03.750 --> 1:13:05.666
Wait right here. I'll get some more.

1:13:18.125 --> 1:13:20.333
<i>You four have outdone yourselves</i>
<i>yet again.</i>

1:13:20.416 --> 1:13:22.291
<i>It definitely looks like a party in here.</i>

1:13:22.375 --> 1:13:23.708
<i> Thank you.</i>

1:13:23.791 --> 1:13:26.416
<i>Now, before you tell us</i>
<i>which dessert you're taking,</i>

1:13:26.500 --> 1:13:27.416
<i>why don't you--</i>

1:13:29.750 --> 1:13:30.875
Where's the remote?

1:13:36.250 --> 1:13:38.583
<i>All right, you two,</i>
<i>which dessert are you choosing?</i>

1:13:38.666 --> 1:13:41.208
<i>-We are choosing…</i>

1:13:45.583 --> 1:13:46.708
-Come on.

1:13:46.791 --> 1:13:48.166
Are you serious?

1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:52.833
Kevin.

1:13:52.916 --> 1:13:54.541
Shh. Come on.

1:13:54.625 --> 1:13:56.750
Look, man, I gotta tell you, I'm just--

1:13:56.833 --> 1:13:59.083
-I, uh…
-Tell me later. Please. Come on.

1:14:02.041 --> 1:14:05.333
You know Ray.
He's the drummer from Mollycoddle.

1:14:05.416 --> 1:14:06.958
Anyway, he's a good guy.

1:14:07.750 --> 1:14:08.583
Bring him.

1:14:09.166 --> 1:14:11.750
You do know we have to bring you back
after Battle of the Bands?

1:14:12.333 --> 1:14:13.208
That's cool.

1:14:13.708 --> 1:14:17.000
Can't deal on the outside.
I don't have the coping mechanisms.

1:14:17.083 --> 1:14:18.500
Okay, wait. How are we getting out?

1:14:24.708 --> 1:14:26.833
-Okay.
-Right, come on.

1:14:26.916 --> 1:14:28.375
Move out, please.

1:14:34.333 --> 1:14:36.250
-Let's go. Come on.
-No running.

1:14:36.333 --> 1:14:37.583
Outside.

1:14:53.958 --> 1:14:54.958
You!

1:15:00.125 --> 1:15:01.125
Fuck. Fuck.

1:15:47.875 --> 1:15:50.666
This thing… it's fucking useless.

1:15:51.416 --> 1:15:54.208
You'll never get clean articulation
at high speeds with a pick this thin.

1:15:59.791 --> 1:16:00.833
Here.

1:16:02.583 --> 1:16:03.416
Try this one.

1:16:07.041 --> 1:16:07.875
Thank you.

1:16:08.375 --> 1:16:09.833
-This your car?
-Yeah.

1:16:10.500 --> 1:16:11.625
It's a real piece of shit.

1:16:23.208 --> 1:16:24.958
You deserve a better best friend.

1:16:26.125 --> 1:16:28.541
Yeah, probably, but you're the one I got.

1:16:32.875 --> 1:16:34.125
I'm sorry, Kevin.

1:16:36.458 --> 1:16:37.583
Don't say it to me.

1:17:15.416 --> 1:17:17.083
You nearly cracked my fucking skull, dude.

1:17:18.041 --> 1:17:20.250
And you put a really large dent
in my guitar.

1:17:21.083 --> 1:17:24.208
Your behavior has been violent
and unpredictable.

1:17:28.958 --> 1:17:30.833
You are metal beyond reproach.

1:17:35.625 --> 1:17:39.250
So will you please, please, please,

1:17:40.333 --> 1:17:41.666
please accept my apology

1:17:41.750 --> 1:17:45.250
and come crack some fucking skulls with us
at the Battle of the Bands?

1:17:56.791 --> 1:17:57.833
I--

1:17:57.916 --> 1:17:58.750
I can't.

1:18:00.083 --> 1:18:01.166
Emily.

1:18:02.041 --> 1:18:02.916
I'm not ready.

1:18:06.041 --> 1:18:06.958
Oh, God.

1:18:33.666 --> 1:18:36.000
Mollycoddle, you guys are up next.

1:18:41.250 --> 1:18:42.083
Dude.

1:18:43.750 --> 1:18:45.333
-Dude?
-I'm sorry.

1:18:45.416 --> 1:18:48.541
You guys have been great,
and I'd love to play with you again, but…

1:18:50.500 --> 1:18:52.208
I can only be in one band.

1:18:54.416 --> 1:18:55.458
I brought you your drummer.

1:18:57.083 --> 1:18:58.208
Is he wasted?

1:19:01.416 --> 1:19:02.416
I feel you, man.

1:19:03.041 --> 1:19:03.875
It's all good.

1:19:05.541 --> 1:19:06.583
Hey, brother.

1:19:07.166 --> 1:19:10.541
I've been meaning to apologize
for what happened at my party.

1:19:10.625 --> 1:19:12.416
Yeah, and I apologize

1:19:12.500 --> 1:19:16.041
for the whole… wedding thing.

1:19:17.250 --> 1:19:18.708
-That was--
-That was weird.

1:19:18.791 --> 1:19:22.291
Yup, and I'm sorry
about the things I said about your band.

1:19:22.791 --> 1:19:23.875
You guys are good…

1:19:25.875 --> 1:19:27.041
at what you do.

1:19:27.958 --> 1:19:29.708
So may the best band win.

1:19:31.958 --> 1:19:34.125
So you guys like a duo?

1:19:35.958 --> 1:19:37.375
Yeah, it looks that way.

1:19:37.875 --> 1:19:39.625
Like the White Stripes?

1:19:41.166 --> 1:19:43.708
Yeah, like the White Stripes.

1:19:43.791 --> 1:19:44.625
Nice.

1:19:45.750 --> 1:19:47.333
You're lucky to have this guy, man.

1:19:49.583 --> 1:19:50.500
Yeah, I am.

1:20:25.000 --> 1:20:27.083
-Yo. Suspension's over, bitch.
-Hey.

1:20:27.166 --> 1:20:28.375
Welcome back, big man.

1:20:28.958 --> 1:20:31.458
-I got a bottle of Jack in the new truck.
-Let's go!

1:20:32.041 --> 1:20:35.291
Thank you, Glenwood Lake.
GLHS is lit!

1:20:35.375 --> 1:20:37.375
-I love you!
-Nix was right about this pick.

1:20:37.458 --> 1:20:39.958
I can do this.
We're gonna crush this shit.

1:20:40.041 --> 1:20:40.875
But I don't know.

1:20:40.958 --> 1:20:43.791
How will it sound with nothing
on the bottom, no chords, no riff?

1:20:44.583 --> 1:20:46.333
No, it-- it'll be like, uh…

1:20:46.833 --> 1:20:48.000
Like jazz…

1:20:48.791 --> 1:20:49.625
…ish.

1:21:25.000 --> 1:21:25.875
Now I'm ready.

1:21:25.958 --> 1:21:27.500
-Dude.

1:21:30.666 --> 1:21:31.708
Let's do this shit.

1:21:32.916 --> 1:21:35.416
One, two, three…

1:21:35.500 --> 1:21:36.750
Skullfucker!

1:21:38.250 --> 1:21:41.041
Nope. That is not appropriate.
It's got to go.

1:21:41.125 --> 1:21:43.166
-No, it can't go.

1:21:43.250 --> 1:21:44.500
It is painted on the heads.

1:21:44.583 --> 1:21:46.916
Well, I can't let you
bring those in there, so…

1:21:53.666 --> 1:21:55.041
-Wha--

1:21:55.833 --> 1:21:56.666
Oy.

1:21:58.541 --> 1:22:02.166
-Eli, I need a favor.
-Of course, Emily. What do you need?

1:22:02.250 --> 1:22:04.125
I need to get into the art room.

1:22:06.625 --> 1:22:10.458
Ladies and gentlemen,
a round of applause for Skullflower.

1:22:32.083 --> 1:22:35.500
This is a little song… about…

1:22:36.208 --> 1:22:41.416
…the machinery of torment!

1:23:54.833 --> 1:23:57.875
Hey, isn't that Hunter Sylvester
and Kevin Schlieb?

1:23:58.375 --> 1:24:01.041
And what's-her-name,
the-- the shitty clarinetist.

1:24:01.125 --> 1:24:03.416
Could've been in a band with those guys.

1:24:14.791 --> 1:24:16.083
This blows.

1:24:28.000 --> 1:24:28.833
Dude.

1:24:29.916 --> 1:24:30.958
-No.

1:24:43.083 --> 1:24:44.333
Woo-woo.

1:24:44.416 --> 1:24:46.583
Yeah! Metal! Woo!

1:26:56.500 --> 1:26:57.708
-Ah!

1:27:06.083 --> 1:27:07.791
-Oh, shit.

1:27:09.750 --> 1:27:11.416
Oh, shit. Oh…

1:27:18.416 --> 1:27:20.583
Call an ambulance. Someone call 911.

1:27:20.666 --> 1:27:22.875
Hunter, don't look at your leg, okay?

1:27:37.833 --> 1:27:39.041
My toes are so numb.

1:27:39.916 --> 1:27:42.125
Gotta wiggle them.
Come on, little fuckers.

1:27:55.958 --> 1:27:58.958
This fucking bow is fucked.

1:27:59.041 --> 1:28:00.583
-Ow, dude.

1:28:00.666 --> 1:28:02.500
-Dude.
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Sorry.

1:28:05.708 --> 1:28:06.625
Ah! That's better.

1:28:23.708 --> 1:28:26.208
Congratulations.

1:28:26.291 --> 1:28:27.791
Bronze medalists.

1:28:27.875 --> 1:28:30.458
Silver medalists. We came in second.

1:28:30.958 --> 1:28:34.458
Oh, hey, uh,
looks like you're going viral.

1:28:37.458 --> 1:28:40.291
Well… at least I didn't get arrested.

1:28:41.291 --> 1:28:42.166
So,

1:28:43.416 --> 1:28:44.500
progress?

1:28:45.250 --> 1:28:46.083
Well,

1:28:47.208 --> 1:28:48.708
no bad publicity, right?

1:28:52.708 --> 1:28:54.916
All right, well,

1:28:56.166 --> 1:28:57.083
I got a date.

1:28:57.166 --> 1:28:59.375
Yeah, she's a pediatrician.

1:29:00.041 --> 1:29:01.791
Big tits. Natural.

1:29:01.875 --> 1:29:03.666
Not a client.

1:29:08.958 --> 1:29:10.500
I can't believe we lost.

1:29:15.041 --> 1:29:16.666
It's fine. It's cool.

1:29:17.333 --> 1:29:20.583
They're nice guys. The people have spoken.
This is what they want.

1:29:21.500 --> 1:29:23.291
-No, fuck 'em.

1:29:23.375 --> 1:29:25.000
Fuck 'em, every single one.

1:29:25.083 --> 1:29:27.208
Who are people gonna remember? Us.

1:29:27.291 --> 1:29:29.125
That is us right there, headlining.

1:29:29.208 --> 1:29:31.875
-We were good.
-No, we were fucking great.

1:29:31.958 --> 1:29:34.291
You smashed that intro, dude.

1:29:34.375 --> 1:29:37.208
Yes, she did. That was some Yo-Yo Ma shit.

1:29:37.291 --> 1:29:39.458
-And your solo…
-Holy fuck, that was unreal.

1:29:39.541 --> 1:29:41.500
But what about this motherfucker?

1:29:41.583 --> 1:29:44.791
Oh, my man slapped them in their faces
with his double bass dick.

1:29:47.666 --> 1:29:49.750
Yes. Uh, yes, I did.

1:29:50.708 --> 1:29:52.500
-You know what?

1:29:52.583 --> 1:29:55.708
Let them have their fads.
Fads come and go.

1:29:55.791 --> 1:29:56.875
But not us.

1:29:57.416 --> 1:29:58.250
We're forever.

1:29:58.333 --> 1:30:00.833
Now it starts for us.
Now people know our name.

1:30:01.958 --> 1:30:03.333
We're Skullflower.

1:30:03.916 --> 1:30:05.416
Skullflower!

1:30:06.000 --> 1:30:07.083
<i>Fuck, we rip.</i>
