After each band's performance,
I would like you to clap your hands.

As you can see, the Mouseke-Clapper

05:26.692 --> 05:28.900
always starts on the number one.

05:29.067 --> 05:32.442
When you're clapping,
the pointer goes up, up, up.

05:32.525 --> 05:34.442
And that way the Mouseke-Clapper

05:34.567 --> 05:37.442
tells us how much
you're all liking that band.

05:37.567 --> 05:40.650
Now, watch what happens
when you're clapping a little more!

05:42.817 --> 05:43.983
How about that?

05:44.067 --> 05:47.108
And when you're clapping up a storm
even more than that,

05:47.192 --> 05:49.192
the little pointer goes up even higher.

05:49.317 --> 05:51.775
This time from number one to number eight!

05:51.900 --> 05:53.608
-Wow.

the most hand-clapping
