00:01.860 --> 00:03.168
POTE: Previously
on "Queen of the South"...

00:03.200 --> 00:04.690
I'm done with this business.

00:04.730 --> 00:06.561
Let's be a family
before the world

00:06.600 --> 00:07.965
tries to tear us apart again.

00:08.000 --> 00:09.467
-Don't!
-(gunshot)

00:09.510 --> 00:11.831
Agh!

00:11.870 --> 00:13.474
CORTEZ:
Camila is playing you.

00:13.510 --> 00:15.375
Just 'cause our kids _are
engaged to be married,

00:15.410 --> 00:17.139
you don't think
I'll kill the bitch?

00:17.180 --> 00:20.047
(speaking Spanish)

00:20.080 --> 00:21.741
-(grunts)
-(people gasping)

00:21.780 --> 00:24.715
(sobbing)

00:24.750 --> 00:26.854
(people clamoring)

00:26.890 --> 00:29.154
CAMILA: Isabela, it's okay.

00:29.190 --> 00:30.487
You do what you need to do.

00:30.530 --> 00:32.054
You'll get no interference
from me.

00:32.100 --> 00:33.556
We're nearly free of Boaz,

00:33.600 --> 00:36.228
but there is still the matter
of Teresa Mendoza.

00:36.270 --> 00:37.692
Whatever you've done,

00:37.730 --> 00:41.188
you don't need
to hide from me.

00:41.240 --> 00:43.003
PECAS: It's Pecas.

00:43.040 --> 00:45.031
Came across a little something
here in Phoenix.

00:45.070 --> 00:47.072
You might be interested.

00:47.110 --> 00:50.079
(tense music)

00:50.110 --> 00:53.944

00:53.980 --> 00:56.949

01:16.670 --> 01:17.864
(sighs)

01:17.910 --> 01:20.538
EPIFANIO:
Mi amor, es espactular.

01:20.580 --> 01:22.070
Gracias.

01:22.110 --> 01:23.646
(smooches)

01:23.680 --> 01:25.739
For 25 years together.

01:25.780 --> 01:28.214
And every night
I thank the heavens

01:28.250 --> 01:30.639
that you decided to marry
a baboso like me.

01:30.690 --> 01:32.419
Salud.

01:35.620 --> 01:38.327
EPIFANIO: What's wrong?
You're not drinking.

01:38.360 --> 01:42.626
I found a very...
large transfer

01:42.670 --> 01:44.661
in our bank statement today.

01:44.700 --> 01:46.930
You know,
just out of curiosity,

01:46.970 --> 01:49.666
how much longer am I gonna
keep paying for your whore?

01:52.510 --> 01:55.274
You can be as generous
as you want with your dick,

01:55.310 --> 01:57.141
just not with my money.

01:57.180 --> 01:59.512
And I'm gonna tell you
something else.

01:59.550 --> 02:03.338
If I ever see...

02:03.390 --> 02:05.745
that you deposit
one more cent

02:05.790 --> 02:08.588
to that puta...

02:08.620 --> 02:10.178
she's dead.

02:10.230 --> 02:11.527
*

02:11.560 --> 02:13.323
Your rage

02:13.360 --> 02:16.488
and desire for revenge

02:16.530 --> 02:18.862
will be your end,
mi vida.

02:18.900 --> 02:25.601
*

02:25.640 --> 02:28.108
Happy anniversary.

02:28.140 --> 02:29.846
Enjoy your watch.

02:29.880 --> 02:35.876
*

02:35.920 --> 02:38.889
(cell phone buzzing)

02:38.920 --> 02:40.888
*

02:42.390 --> 02:43.823
Bueno?

02:43.860 --> 02:46.749
BOAZ: (speaking Spanish)

02:48.100 --> 02:50.022
What can I do for you, Boaz?

02:50.070 --> 02:52.231
You know, mi amigo Pecas
picked up Teresa Mendoza

02:52.270 --> 02:53.999
as a favor for me.

02:54.040 --> 02:56.338
I handed them over
to your pinche general.

02:56.370 --> 02:58.235
Still got to collect
my bounty.

02:58.270 --> 02:59.976
Say I give you
the family discount.

03:00.010 --> 03:01.477
(speaking Spanish)

03:01.510 --> 03:02.841
CAMILA:
Thanks...

03:02.880 --> 03:05.178
but I don't pay debt
to a dead man.

03:05.210 --> 03:07.075
See you on the other side...

03:07.120 --> 03:08.644
suegro.

03:08.680 --> 03:11.649
(tense music)

03:11.690 --> 03:15.410
(sighs)

03:15.460 --> 03:22.468

03:29.200 --> 03:30.736

03:32.310 --> 03:35.677
(man speaking Spanish)

03:35.710 --> 03:42.718
*

03:48.660 --> 03:50.252
These will be_
your accommodations

03:50.290 --> 03:53.020
during your stay back home.

03:53.060 --> 03:55.119
I hope...

03:55.160 --> 03:57.720
that you will find them
up to your...

03:57.770 --> 04:00.295
high standards, Teresa.

04:00.340 --> 04:02.706
I would like to speak
with Camila.

04:02.740 --> 04:04.401
She needs to know
what will happen

04:04.440 --> 04:05.930
if I don't walk out of here.

04:05.970 --> 04:08.700
La gobernadora will see you
when she's ready.

04:08.740 --> 04:10.207
Until then...

04:12.350 --> 04:15.114
*

04:15.150 --> 04:17.289
(fence rattling)

04:17.320 --> 04:22.110
*

04:22.160 --> 04:23.980
No, no...

04:24.030 --> 04:25.725
*

04:25.760 --> 04:27.057
Guero?

04:27.100 --> 04:29.625
No.

04:29.670 --> 04:31.092
Teresa?

04:31.130 --> 04:32.768
No.

04:42.480 --> 04:44.141
(motorcycle engine rumbling)

04:44.180 --> 04:45.647
Where are you?

04:45.680 --> 04:47.477
Hey, look, I'm on my way
to the meeting spot,

04:47.520 --> 04:48.942
but I got a little bit
of heat on me.

04:48.980 --> 04:51.084
Okay, lose them first.

04:51.120 --> 04:53.008
Meet us at the port.

04:53.060 --> 04:55.779
-I love you.
-I love you, too.

04:55.820 --> 04:58.789
(dramatic music)

04:58.830 --> 05:05.827
*

05:36.900 --> 05:38.959
Se fue, idiota.

05:39.000 --> 05:45.007
*

05:46.940 --> 05:49.647
CORTEZ:
Tell me where she is,

05:49.680 --> 05:52.911
and I'll untie you
and treat you like a king.

05:52.950 --> 05:55.373

05:57.790 --> 06:00.418
pedicures--
anything you want, Guero.

06:00.460 --> 06:06.148
*

06:06.190 --> 06:09.728
She left you
high and dry.

06:09.770 --> 06:11.897
Save yourself.

06:11.930 --> 06:13.898
(spits)

06:13.940 --> 06:19.264

06:19.310 --> 06:21.278

06:34.060 --> 06:36.756
*

06:36.790 --> 06:38.257
Doctor!

06:38.290 --> 06:40.019
Aydale.

06:40.060 --> 06:43.461

06:43.500 --> 06:46.025

(speaking Spanish)

06:58.510 --> 07:05.518
*

07:08.320 --> 07:11.448
If it wasn't for that doctor,
I'd be gone by now.

07:11.490 --> 07:14.653
You didn't give up
Marbella to Cortez?

07:14.700 --> 07:16.918
What, and tell him
that was our plan? Hell, no.

07:16.970 --> 07:19.325
Cortez could beat me
for another eight months,

07:19.370 --> 07:20.928
and I wouldn't betray you.

07:20.970 --> 07:23.131
I went to Malta instead.

07:23.170 --> 07:25.058
Should've looked for you.

07:25.110 --> 07:26.668
No, it's good that you didn't.

07:26.710 --> 07:28.405
That's what Camila wanted.

07:28.440 --> 07:30.943
I knew that she'd bring
you here one of these days.

07:30.980 --> 07:33.642
I think I got a plan for us
to try and get out of here.

07:33.680 --> 07:37.138
(poignant music)

07:37.190 --> 07:40.250
You're the only thing
that's kept me alive, Teresa.

07:40.290 --> 07:44.351
*

07:48.000 --> 07:49.661
I know they did it.

07:49.700 --> 07:53.090
Pecas is the type of man that
doesn't like to be accused.

07:53.140 --> 07:55.028
Well, if La Comisin
didn't take her,

07:55.070 --> 07:56.867
they know who did.

07:56.910 --> 07:59.003
Sometimes the fly needs honey,

07:59.040 --> 08:00.678
sometimes the hammer.

08:02.480 --> 08:03.947
and you get nothing.

08:03.980 --> 08:06.869
We don't have time.

08:06.920 --> 08:08.615
(door bells jingle)

08:08.650 --> 08:11.380
Pecas!

08:11.420 --> 08:14.150
Where is she?

08:14.190 --> 08:17.057
Can't a guy enjoy
his doughnuts on cheat day?

08:17.090 --> 08:19.650
-I know you have her.
PECAS: Sit down.

08:19.700 --> 08:22.498
Relax. Have a bear claw.
It's on me.

08:22.530 --> 08:24.725
(traditional Mexican music
Playing)

08:24.770 --> 08:27.068
(sniffs)

08:27.100 --> 08:30.558
*

08:30.610 --> 08:32.578
You hit like a little girl.

08:32.610 --> 08:36.034
*

08:36.080 --> 08:39.709
I delivered Teresa
to my connect.

08:39.750 --> 08:41.968
So she's in Mexico?

08:42.020 --> 08:43.419
Maybe.

08:43.450 --> 08:45.042
Maybe not.

08:45.090 --> 08:47.081
(inhales sharply)

08:47.120 --> 08:50.089
I turned her over
to one of Boaz's guys.

08:50.130 --> 08:51.654
That's all I know.

08:51.690 --> 08:52.998
James...

08:53.030 --> 08:54.827
Listen to your friend, Romeo.

08:54.860 --> 08:56.725
Teresa's a hot boss.

08:56.770 --> 08:58.988
But thinking
with your little pee-pee's

08:59.030 --> 09:00.839
going to get you killed.

09:00.870 --> 09:03.862
Call Boaz...now.

09:03.910 --> 09:07.607
(tense synth music)

09:07.640 --> 09:10.768
-(cell phone ringing)
-The plan didn't work, pendejo!

09:10.810 --> 09:12.744
And now the crazy perra
is after me.

09:12.780 --> 09:15.271
Well, that's what you get for
negotiating with Camila Vargas.

09:15.320 --> 09:17.584
BOAZ: Who the hell is this?
Where's Pecas?

09:17.620 --> 09:19.952
JAMES:
This is James.

09:19.990 --> 09:21.912
Pinche Santiago!

09:21.960 --> 09:24.554
You want to get revenge
on Camila,

09:24.590 --> 09:26.251
take away what she wants most.

09:26.290 --> 09:28.121
Help me find Teresa.

09:28.160 --> 09:29.764
BOAZ: If it means hurting
that perra, I'll help you,

09:29.800 --> 09:31.688
but I don't know
where your girl is,

09:31.730 --> 09:33.561
just that Camila's got her.

09:33.600 --> 09:35.591
(speaking Spanish)

09:35.640 --> 09:41.738
*

09:41.780 --> 09:43.975
We're getting
on a plane to Mexico.

09:45.310 --> 09:48.040
Malta, huh?

09:48.080 --> 09:49.945
I always knew you were destined
for some badass shit.

09:49.990 --> 09:51.446
(chuckles)

09:51.490 --> 09:53.481
Just_ like a little
cocaine princess.

09:53.520 --> 09:55.385
(chuckles)

09:55.420 --> 09:57.729
It's a long way from
counting money in Culiacn.

09:57.760 --> 09:59.284
Yeah.

09:59.330 --> 10:01.753
I learned cryptocurrency...

10:03.270 --> 10:05.124
Banking without cash.

10:05.170 --> 10:07.331
-No shit.
-(chuckles softly)

10:07.370 --> 10:09.395
Then I made an enemy, so...

10:09.440 --> 10:11.169
we fled to Phoenix.

10:11.210 --> 10:14.179
I bought a winery
as front for the business

10:14.210 --> 10:15.677
and a plane.

10:15.710 --> 10:17.348
I'm learning how to fly.

10:17.380 --> 10:18.847
(inhales deeply)

10:18.880 --> 10:22.270
Oh, Jesus, that's the kicker
right there.

10:22.320 --> 10:25.084
You started to solo yet?

10:25.120 --> 10:26.758
Soon.

10:26.790 --> 10:28.917
I'm gonna be
your first passenger.

10:28.960 --> 10:31.224
-Okay. (chuckles)
-Can't wait.

10:36.800 --> 10:39.769
(brooding music)

10:39.800 --> 10:41.495
*

10:41.540 --> 10:44.134
Hello, Teresa.

10:44.170 --> 10:46.673
It's good to see you here.

10:46.710 --> 10:48.701
You like the surprise?

10:48.740 --> 10:52.141
*

10:52.180 --> 10:54.614
I picked you up...

10:54.650 --> 10:57.118
when this rat
left you for dead.

10:57.150 --> 10:58.708
*

10:58.750 --> 11:00.718
I housed you.

11:00.760 --> 11:02.648
I protected you.

11:02.690 --> 11:04.851
No.

11:04.890 --> 11:07.529
You sent James to kill me.

11:07.560 --> 11:09.619
I hear that he works
for you now.

11:09.660 --> 11:11.890
He followed his click
right back to you.

11:11.930 --> 11:14.194
And now you share a house...

11:14.240 --> 11:17.334
and a bed.

11:17.370 --> 11:19.838
But he couldn't
protect you from me,

11:19.880 --> 11:21.905
so here we are.

11:21.940 --> 11:24.044
You see, eventually,

11:24.080 --> 11:26.571
we all have to pay
for our sins.

11:26.610 --> 11:33.584
*

11:47.640 --> 11:50.939
You killed Epifanio.

11:50.970 --> 11:54.337
And you allowed me
to watch him die in my arms.

11:54.380 --> 11:56.905
*

11:56.950 --> 11:59.544
Your need for power

11:59.580 --> 12:01.639
is what got Epifanio killed.

12:01.680 --> 12:03.409
*

12:03.450 --> 12:05.941
It wasn't me.

12:05.990 --> 12:07.457
I have an employee

12:07.490 --> 12:09.355
who hacked into your
Cayman Islands accounts.

12:09.390 --> 12:12.723
By now,
he knows you've taken me.

12:12.760 --> 12:15.297
He's been instructed
to transfer 10 million pesos

12:15.330 --> 12:18.891
from Sinaloa State Bank
into one of them.

12:18.930 --> 12:23.264
After that, he'll make
the transfer public.

12:23.310 --> 12:25.608
You expect me
to believe that shit?

12:25.640 --> 12:28.609
You know what will happen
when Sinaloa discovers

12:28.640 --> 12:31.108
you're just another
dirty politician.

12:31.150 --> 12:32.879
(exhales softly)

12:32.920 --> 12:36.117
(suspenseful music)

12:36.150 --> 12:40.780
*

12:40.820 --> 12:43.789
(indistinct shouting)

12:43.830 --> 12:50.793
*

12:50.830 --> 12:54.664
(breathing heavily)

13:02.440 --> 13:05.238
You're going to watch...

13:05.280 --> 13:07.919
the love of your life die

13:09.780 --> 13:11.919
*

13:11.950 --> 13:13.781
And painful death.

13:13.820 --> 13:17.187
A death of 1,000 cuts.

13:17.230 --> 13:21.121
*

13:21.160 --> 13:22.525
GUERO: No, no!
-(blade slices)

13:22.560 --> 13:25.620
(Guero yelling)

13:25.670 --> 13:28.639
(haunting music)

13:28.670 --> 13:35.678
*

13:37.310 --> 13:40.313
(Guero breathing heavily)

13:45.150 --> 13:47.550
And, Teresa...

13:47.590 --> 13:51.378
there's not a damn thing
you can do about it.

13:51.430 --> 13:58.427
*

14:03.410 --> 14:04.900
It's okay.

14:11.350 --> 14:13.978
I mean, what are the chances
that I could find a house

14:14.020 --> 14:15.317
with an airplane hangar in it?

14:15.350 --> 14:17.545
You moved your other
girlfriend in first.

14:17.590 --> 14:20.559
(soft wistful music)

14:20.590 --> 14:22.649
*

14:22.690 --> 14:25.420
We got a pool house
around the corner.

14:25.460 --> 14:27.018
We can take afternoon naps.

14:27.060 --> 14:28.857
We can--I mean, we can do
whatever you want.

14:28.900 --> 14:30.322
(chuckles)

14:30.370 --> 14:33.191
Come on, check out the inside.

14:33.240 --> 14:35.765
-I can't believe this.
-Believe it.

14:35.800 --> 14:38.769
Check this out.
This is my favorite part.

14:38.810 --> 14:41.608
It's a bedroom.

14:41.640 --> 14:44.905
I mean,
it's not much now, but...

14:44.950 --> 14:46.679
It's perfect.

14:46.710 --> 14:53.411
*

14:55.460 --> 14:58.224
Messing with
Camila's accounts...

14:58.260 --> 15:00.251
that was smart.

15:00.300 --> 15:04.122
She wants revenge more than
the power or the money.

15:04.170 --> 15:06.263
It will only buy us time.

15:06.300 --> 15:09.030
Well, that's what we need.

15:09.070 --> 15:12.130
And Cortez--he thinks
he's got it all figured out.

15:12.170 --> 15:14.536
He's got locks on every door

15:14.580 --> 15:17.140
and guards 24-7.

15:17.180 --> 15:19.944
But he can't_ control
everything.

15:19.980 --> 15:26.988
*

15:28.190 --> 15:30.329
(speaking Spanish)

15:30.360 --> 15:33.397
(speaking Spanish)

15:33.430 --> 15:37.196
-(laughs)
-(speaking Spanish)

15:42.100 --> 15:49.108
*

16:06.630 --> 16:09.190
(breathing heavily)

16:09.230 --> 16:11.460
*

16:11.500 --> 16:14.469
I have to stay alive.

16:14.500 --> 16:17.708
Shh, Shh, Shh.

16:17.740 --> 16:19.628
Para Teresa.

16:19.670 --> 16:23.970
*

16:24.010 --> 16:27.446
(speaking Spanish)

16:27.480 --> 16:34.488
*

16:39.160 --> 16:42.129
(speaking Spanish)

16:42.160 --> 16:49.168
*

16:53.080 --> 16:56.402
GUERO: The doctor couldn't
watch me suffer anymore.

16:56.440 --> 16:59.477
Now that you're here,
we've got a shot.

16:59.510 --> 17:01.319
Every night...

17:01.350 --> 17:02.840
one of the guards--
he goes out,

17:02.880 --> 17:05.348
and he calls his mom
on the phone,

17:05.390 --> 17:07.187
leaves the other guard alone,

17:07.220 --> 17:09.518
and that's when we strike.

17:09.560 --> 17:13.599
*

17:13.630 --> 17:15.848
(birds chirping)

17:15.900 --> 17:18.892
(speaking Spanish)

17:22.900 --> 17:25.403
(speaking Spanish)

17:28.140 --> 17:30.404
-(door opens)
CORTEZ: Isabela, wait...

17:30.450 --> 17:32.338
I'm in a meeting, Isabela.

17:32.380 --> 17:33.847
I need to speak
with you, alone.

17:33.880 --> 17:35.609
It's important.

17:41.460 --> 17:43.883
Is there something
you want to talk to me about?

17:43.930 --> 17:46.182
Some big news?

17:46.230 --> 17:48.095
I don't know
what you're talking about.

17:48.130 --> 17:49.859
Kique told me you have Teresa.

17:49.900 --> 17:51.788
His father told him she's here.

17:51.830 --> 17:53.229
(sighs)

17:53.270 --> 17:55.135
Why did I have
to hear it from him?

17:55.170 --> 17:57.206
You promised you'd tell me.

17:57.240 --> 17:58.798
She killed my father.

17:58.840 --> 18:00.569
I deserve to see her today.

18:00.610 --> 18:02.100
I don't think it's a good idea.

18:02.140 --> 18:03.607
That prison
is no place for you.

18:03.650 --> 18:05.299
I'm not asking
for your permission.

18:05.350 --> 18:07.147
I know where she is,
and I have the right.

18:07.180 --> 18:09.569
CORTEZ: Isabela,
your mother has said no.

18:09.620 --> 18:11.941
(dark music)

18:11.990 --> 18:14.208
If I spoke to my mother
like that,

18:14.260 --> 18:16.410
I would not be standing here
right now.

18:16.460 --> 18:17.927
My father would kill me.

18:17.960 --> 18:20.793
That disrespect can lead
to serious consequence.

18:20.830 --> 18:23.321
This is between me
and my mom.

18:23.370 --> 18:24.598
She's right.

18:24.630 --> 18:26.723
This is family business.

18:26.770 --> 18:28.988
I won't have you
threatening my daughter.

18:29.040 --> 18:30.564
My apologies.

18:30.610 --> 18:31.963
*

18:32.010 --> 18:35.104
-(door closes)
-(sighs)

18:35.140 --> 18:36.937
You heard my decision.

18:39.110 --> 18:41.078
Isabela...

18:41.120 --> 18:42.678
(door closes)

18:42.720 --> 18:45.109
*

18:45.150 --> 18:46.117

18:48.990 --> 18:52.448
(Jos speaking Spanish)

18:52.490 --> 18:54.697
(dramatic music)

18:54.730 --> 18:57.028
GUERO: He's on the phone.
We need to go now.

18:57.060 --> 19:00.962
*

19:01.000 --> 19:03.264
-Keep an eye on him.
-Mm-hmm.

19:03.310 --> 19:05.107
*

19:05.140 --> 19:06.835
(grunting)

19:06.870 --> 19:07.939
*

19:07.980 --> 19:09.834
Okay.

19:09.880 --> 19:16.877
*

19:23.690 --> 19:26.659
(Guero breathing heavily)

19:26.690 --> 19:28.794

19:28.830 --> 19:30.388
Oye!

19:30.430 --> 19:33.126

JOSE:
Oye. Qu est pasando?

19:54.120 --> 19:56.088

*

19:58.630 --> 20:01.155
(lock rattling)

20:01.200 --> 20:02.929
Come on.

20:02.960 --> 20:09.069
*

20:09.100 --> 20:12.263
Isabela, put the gun down.
Guero, it's okay.

20:12.310 --> 20:14.232
We got to get out of here,
Teresa, now.

20:14.280 --> 20:15.508
It's okay.

20:15.540 --> 20:17.076
You took my father from me.

20:17.110 --> 20:20.511
The person to blame,
Isabela, is your mother.

20:20.550 --> 20:21.710
Okay?

20:21.750 --> 20:24.048
I will kill you.

20:24.090 --> 20:27.878
*

20:27.920 --> 20:29.581
(whimpering)

20:29.620 --> 20:31.952
GUERO: There's a car out back.
-Come on, let's go.

20:31.990 --> 20:37.189
*

20:37.230 --> 20:39.369
CAMILA:
That's Isabela's car.

20:39.400 --> 20:43.097
*

20:43.140 --> 20:45.529
-You okay?
-Yeah.

-Est bien?
-S.

21:34.790 --> 21:36.587
-(pop)
GUERO: Shit.

21:36.620 --> 21:39.020
Damn it, the tires.

21:39.060 --> 21:42.029
(engine sputtering)

TERESA: You okay?
-Yeah, come on, let's go.

21:50.340 --> 21:53.138
TERESA: (groans) We need to
get you to the doctor.

21:53.170 --> 21:54.808
*

21:54.840 --> 21:56.637
Toms's clinic is close.

(sniffles)

22:08.660 --> 22:11.026
(sobbing)
Teresa got away.

22:11.060 --> 22:14.120
Are you okay?
Are you hurt?

22:14.160 --> 22:15.821
-No.
-Come on.

22:19.170 --> 22:21.730
(sobs)
I tried to kill her.

22:21.770 --> 22:23.362
(sniffles)
And I couldn't.

22:23.410 --> 22:25.230
-I'm so sorry, Mom.
-Shh, shh. Shh. Shh.

22:25.270 --> 22:27.374
(solemn music)

22:27.410 --> 22:28.900
I told you not to come here.

22:28.940 --> 22:32.000
(scoffs)
I said I was sorry.

22:32.050 --> 22:35.315
You disrespected me.

22:35.350 --> 22:37.682
_ There will be
serious consequences.

22:37.720 --> 22:40.689
This wasn't about you.

22:40.720 --> 22:43.211
-I did it for me.
-Rea|ly?

22:43.260 --> 22:44.750
You're forbidden
from seeing Kique.

22:44.790 --> 22:47.327
That's crazy.
We're getting married.

22:47.360 --> 22:48.759
Not anymore.

22:48.800 --> 22:50.256
The wedding's off.

22:50.300 --> 22:52.427
Until you learn how to make
better decisions,

22:52.470 --> 22:53.767
I'm making them for you.

22:53.800 --> 22:56.439
*

22:56.470 --> 22:58.938
I'm doing what's best for you.

22:58.970 --> 23:00.699
You'll thank me one day.

23:00.740 --> 23:03.868
-Come on.
ISABELA: No!

23:03.910 --> 23:06.401
*

23:06.450 --> 23:08.611
You just want me to spend
the rest of my life

23:08.650 --> 23:10.515
by your side...

23:10.550 --> 23:14.213
just as miserable and alone...

23:14.260 --> 23:15.409
as you are.

23:15.460 --> 23:18.429
(music intensifies)

(tires screech, engine revs)

23:28.100 --> 23:29.965
CAMILA:
Teresa and Guero nearly took

23:30.000 --> 23:31.706
my daughter from me tonight.

23:31.740 --> 23:34.538
Isabela may hate me now,

23:34.580 --> 23:36.878
but eventually
she'll understand

23:36.910 --> 23:38.571
that what I did
was best for her.

23:38.610 --> 23:40.373
No.

23:40.410 --> 23:42.571
It is I who failed you both.

23:42.620 --> 23:44.713
You kept me out of harm's way,

23:44.750 --> 23:46.786
and for that, I'm grateful.

23:46.820 --> 23:49.084
Their escape is not your fault.

23:49.120 --> 23:52.829
I'm just thankful
that Isabela's all right.

23:52.860 --> 23:56.455
Maybe it was meant to be.

23:56.500 --> 23:58.161
I promise you,

23:58.200 --> 24:01.169
_ I will not relent
until I lay Teresa at your feet

24:01.200 --> 24:03.168
like hunted prey.

24:03.200 --> 24:05.509
*

24:05.540 --> 24:08.998
I have no doubt
you'll bring her to me.

24:09.040 --> 24:12.908
You're my most loyal soldier.

24:12.950 --> 24:15.441
It's rare when a man
can find a woman

24:15.480 --> 24:18.187
so worthy
of his complete loyalty.

24:18.220 --> 24:20.586
Thank you, General.

24:20.620 --> 24:22.485
*

24:22.520 --> 24:24.988
Are your soldiers
searching the area?

24:25.030 --> 24:27.521
Teresa _and Guero
are fleeIng on foot.

24:27.560 --> 24:30.051
They won't get far.

25:07.330 --> 25:09.161
-Hi.
-Doctor, I'm sorry.

25:09.200 --> 25:11.065
We didn't have--we didn't
have anywhere else to go.

25:11.110 --> 25:13.635
He won't stop bleeding.
Please help us.

25:13.680 --> 25:15.773
Come inside, come on.

25:17.550 --> 25:20.542
(groaning)

25:21.950 --> 25:24.714
That's a bad cut.

25:24.750 --> 25:26.411
It's close to the artery.

25:26.450 --> 25:28.850
-You're Teresa?
-Yes.

25:30.560 --> 25:32.448

25:44.710 --> 25:46.564
We're leaving
as soon as we can.

25:46.610 --> 25:48.202
Is there a phone I can use?

25:49.410 --> 25:51.378
TERESA:
Thank you.

Yeah?

25:59.920 --> 26:01.581
TERESA: It's me.

26:01.620 --> 26:02.757
Teresa.

26:02.790 --> 26:04.781
Are you okay? Where are you?

26:04.830 --> 26:06.229
I'm safe.

26:06.260 --> 26:08.296
I'm in a town
just outside of Culiacn.

26:08.330 --> 26:10.924
I'm with Guero.

26:10.970 --> 26:13.734
I'm with Pote.
We just landed in Sinaloa.

26:13.770 --> 26:16.694
We've got some of Boaz's men.
We've been looking for you.

26:16.740 --> 26:18.435
-Boaz?
JAMES: I'll explain later.

26:18.470 --> 26:20.108
Where exactly are you?

26:20.140 --> 26:22.631
I'm in a clinic in Imala.

26:22.680 --> 26:25.240
-She's in Imala.
-Oh, that's close by.

26:25.280 --> 26:26.645
JAMES:
All right, we're on our way.

26:26.680 --> 26:28.545
Please, hurry.

26:28.580 --> 26:29.979
*

26:30.020 --> 26:31.385
POTE: Is she okay?

26:31.420 --> 26:33.980
-She's with Guero.
POTE: Guero?

26:34.020 --> 26:36.659
Ithought
that pendejo was dead.

26:36.690 --> 26:38.954
JAMES:
I guess not.

26:38.990 --> 26:41.151
*

26:41.200 --> 26:42.622
How's your hand?

26:42.660 --> 26:44.969
If there's trouble,
I need to count on you.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.627
*

26:46.670 --> 26:50.333
I'm good...now.

26:50.370 --> 26:54.272
Quit driving like
a pinche viejita...

26:54.310 --> 26:56.107
and go.

26:56.140 --> 26:59.439
(music builds)

26:59.480 --> 27:01.948
Thank you.

27:01.980 --> 27:04.983
(Guero breathing heavily)

27:07.350 --> 27:09.511
(grunts, groans)

27:14.700 --> 27:17.669
(relaxing music playing)

27:17.700 --> 27:20.692
*

27:20.740 --> 27:23.368
What's this?

27:23.400 --> 27:25.709
We're celebrating.

27:25.740 --> 27:28.379
Hey.

27:28.410 --> 27:31.379
-My birthday is tomorrow.
-I know this.

27:31.410 --> 27:33.674
But I got to make a run
for Epi tomorrow.

27:33.720 --> 27:35.711
*

27:35.750 --> 27:37.149
I got you a present, though.

27:37.180 --> 27:40.047
*

27:40.090 --> 27:41.978
What is it?

27:42.020 --> 27:43.726
It's the deed to the house.

27:43.760 --> 27:45.318
It's yours.

27:45.360 --> 27:47.021
*

27:47.060 --> 27:50.359
No, I can't take this.
This is too much.

27:50.400 --> 27:52.163
No, no, listen,
if anything were to happen,

27:52.200 --> 27:53.622
I want you to have that.

27:53.670 --> 27:58.801
*

27:58.840 --> 28:00.637
It's getting cold.

28:00.670 --> 28:04.299
*

28:04.350 --> 28:06.375
TOMAS: You two are luclq
you got here when you did.

28:06.410 --> 28:07.843
Guero's lost a lot of blood.

28:07.880 --> 28:09.370
(scalpel clanks)

28:09.420 --> 28:11.047
I need more gauze.

28:11.090 --> 28:13.547
-I'll be right back.
-Thank you.

28:13.590 --> 28:16.889
Listen, James and Pote
are in Mexico.

28:16.920 --> 28:19.150
They're coming to help us.

28:19.190 --> 28:21.590
So it's true. You and James
are working together again?

28:21.630 --> 28:24.827
-Yeah.
-You didn't have to call him.

28:24.870 --> 28:27.566
We made it this far,
didn't we?

28:27.600 --> 28:29.898
-Yeah.
-Just you and me, babe.

28:29.940 --> 28:32.261
-We got this.
-I know.

28:33.540 --> 28:35.235
(pounding on door)

28:35.280 --> 28:37.077
CORTEZ:
Doctor, I need to see you!

28:37.110 --> 28:39.704
Do you have a back door?

28:39.750 --> 28:41.513
Okay.

28:41.550 --> 28:43.040
(tense music)

28:43.080 --> 28:45.287
-Come on. This way?
CORTEZ: Doctor!

28:45.320 --> 28:48.255
-(pounding continues)
-(Cortez speaking Spanish)

28:48.290 --> 28:50.349
*

28:50.390 --> 28:51.721
TERESA: We need to hide
until James gets here.

28:51.760 --> 28:52.727
Let's go.

28:52.760 --> 28:54.352
(pounding continues)

28:54.400 --> 28:56.789
Doctor, I know you're in there.
Open the door!

28:56.830 --> 29:00.220
*

29:00.270 --> 29:04.263
(both speaking Spanish)

29:06.140 --> 29:13.148
*

29:26.690 --> 29:29.158
(breathing heavily)

29:29.200 --> 29:32.829
It seems I might have
injured my wrist.

29:32.870 --> 29:34.792
Maybe something for the pain.

29:42.380 --> 29:43.938
TOMAS:
Perhaps you pulled a muscle.

29:43.980 --> 29:46.175
I can wrap it up
just in case.

29:46.210 --> 29:49.145
Was there a problem
in your prison?

29:49.180 --> 29:50.647
Guero escaped.

29:50.680 --> 29:53.513
Someone slipped him this.

29:53.550 --> 29:55.950
You know anything about it?

29:55.990 --> 29:57.287
TOMAS: N0.

29:57.320 --> 29:59.083
Could've been one
of the guards.

29:59.130 --> 30:00.927
CORTEZ: N0.

30:00.960 --> 30:03.155
They're both dead.

30:03.200 --> 30:04.861
Guero and his woman...

30:04.900 --> 30:06.925
killed them both.

30:06.970 --> 30:09.530
Teresa Mendoza,
I'm sure you heard of her.

30:09.570 --> 30:12.437
She murdered our beloved
governor, Epifanio Vargas.

30:12.470 --> 30:14.028
-She did?
-In cold blood...

30:14.080 --> 30:17.129
in front of his wife and child.

30:17.180 --> 30:19.102
Well, I'm sure
you'll find them.

30:19.150 --> 30:21.971
(ominous music)

30:22.020 --> 30:23.544
You have, uh,

30:23.580 --> 30:25.639
another patient here
this evening?

30:25.690 --> 30:27.681
*

30:27.720 --> 30:30.359
TOMAS: Excuse me?

30:30.390 --> 30:32.654
A patient cut herself
making dinner.

30:32.690 --> 30:33.827
Forgot to clean up.

30:34.730 --> 30:37.290
I hope you won't inform
the health department, General.

30:37.330 --> 30:44.338
*

30:45.870 --> 30:47.872
CORTEZ: Was your wife here

30:47.910 --> 30:50.879
when this other patient
came in?

30:50.910 --> 30:53.549
She's visiting her mother
this week with the baby.

30:53.580 --> 30:56.879
I'm here stuck alone, eating
quesadillas three times a day.

30:56.920 --> 30:59.639
*

30:59.690 --> 31:02.386
What a shame.

31:02.420 --> 31:04.888
All alone...

31:04.930 --> 31:06.727
with your quesadillas.

31:06.760 --> 31:11.561
*

31:11.600 --> 31:14.194
(grunting)

31:14.240 --> 31:16.196
(tense music)

31:16.240 --> 31:18.265
Should I ask your wife

31:18.310 --> 31:20.767
who else you're hiding?

31:20.810 --> 31:23.938
(speaking Spanish)

31:23.980 --> 31:30.647
*

31:40.290 --> 31:43.851
(speaking Spanish)

31:43.900 --> 31:50.863
*

31:50.900 --> 31:52.868
-El doctor Toms...
-(gun cocks)

31:52.910 --> 31:55.208
(breathing shakily)

31:55.240 --> 31:58.368
Such a good, good man.

31:58.410 --> 32:04.110
*

32:04.150 --> 32:06.641
(gun cocks)

32:06.690 --> 32:09.659
(tense music)

32:09.690 --> 32:11.624
*

32:11.660 --> 32:14.652
(glass shatters,
tear gas hisses)

32:14.700 --> 32:16.292
(people yelling outside)

32:16.330 --> 32:18.628
-It's James and Pote. Let's go.
-(guns firing)

32:18.670 --> 32:21.639
(dramatic percussive music)

32:21.670 --> 32:24.161
*

32:24.210 --> 32:26.132
I'm here.

32:26.170 --> 32:27.831
Okay, let's go.

32:27.870 --> 32:30.668
*

32:30.710 --> 32:33.270
(grunts)

32:33.310 --> 32:36.177
Listen, Cortez will follow us.
You have time to go, okay?

32:36.220 --> 32:37.812
Get as far away
as you can, all right?

32:37.850 --> 32:40.182
Gracias, seor.

32:40.220 --> 32:41.983
(guns firing)

32:42.020 --> 32:43.180
(both breathing heavily)

32:43.220 --> 32:47.281
*

32:47.330 --> 32:48.695
(man shouting in Spanish)

32:48.730 --> 32:49.754
We have to make
a run for it, okay?

32:49.800 --> 32:50.824
I'll be right next to you.

32:50.860 --> 32:52.623
-Let's go.
-Yeah, go.

32:52.670 --> 32:55.639
*

32:55.670 --> 32:57.433
Ah! (groans)

32:57.470 --> 32:59.028
*

32:59.070 --> 33:01.174
-Are you okay?
-I got hit!

33:01.210 --> 33:03.633
Cover me!

33:03.680 --> 33:08.777
*

33:08.820 --> 33:11.141
-(explosion)
-(guns click)

33:11.190 --> 33:12.839
*

33:12.890 --> 33:14.448
Come on, let's get
out of here!

33:14.490 --> 33:16.981
We can't leave him.
Come on, help me out.

33:17.020 --> 33:18.829
Vamos!

33:18.860 --> 33:24.890
*

33:24.930 --> 33:27.899
(guns firing)

33:27.930 --> 33:34.938
*

33:44.250 --> 33:46.081
(gunshots)

33:46.120 --> 33:48.418
*

33:53.560 --> 33:56.028
-(groaning)
-(murmur|ng)

33:56.060 --> 33:58.392
The bullet just grazed you.
It's gonna be okay.

33:58.430 --> 33:59.692
(groans) It hurts like a bitch.

33:59.730 --> 34:02.767
-I know.
-(groaning, chuckles)

34:02.800 --> 34:05.803
(stammers,
speaking Spanish)

34:07.310 --> 34:09.801
Hey, James, thanks
for helping us out, man.

34:11.580 --> 34:13.901
Hey, Pote, it's good
to see you, too, man.

34:13.950 --> 34:15.269
Looks like you lost
a little bit of weight.

34:15.320 --> 34:16.912
(speaking Spanish)

34:16.950 --> 34:18.838
Is he coming
to Phoenix with us?

34:18.890 --> 34:20.915
Yeah.

34:23.260 --> 34:25.251
All right, we need another guy
at the winery.

34:26.590 --> 34:30.424
And Teresa's been shopping
for planes, so...

34:30.460 --> 34:32.462
we could use another pilot.

34:32.500 --> 34:34.866
Listen, whatever you guys need,
I'm all-in.

34:34.900 --> 34:37.767
(solemn music)

34:37.800 --> 34:40.530
(watch rattling)

34:40.570 --> 34:46.907
*

34:46.950 --> 34:50.044
EPIFANIO:
Camila, don't do this.

34:50.080 --> 34:51.786
And, please,
take your ring back.

34:51.820 --> 34:53.913
I made up my mind.

34:53.950 --> 34:57.078
(soft music)

34:57.120 --> 34:59.156
If you need to expand
the business in Dallas,

34:59.190 --> 35:01.420
I can send Batman
to run the operation.

35:01.460 --> 35:03.257
Batman is not a businessman.

35:03.300 --> 35:05.791
He'll run the entire
organization into the ground.

35:05.830 --> 35:07.559
Camila, I love you,

35:07.600 --> 35:08.931
and I need you by my side

35:08.970 --> 35:11.268
to run the campaign
for governorship.

35:11.310 --> 35:13.335
The people love you.

35:13.370 --> 35:16.828
Having you on my arm will win
me all the votes I need.

35:16.880 --> 35:18.438
*

35:18.480 --> 35:21.574
You just want to keep me
under your thumb.

35:21.620 --> 35:24.145
I'm not that woman.

35:24.190 --> 35:25.987
I thought you knew that.

35:26.020 --> 35:29.353
You want to throw
a 25-year marriage away,

35:29.390 --> 35:32.029
then so be it.

35:32.060 --> 35:33.982
Good luck in Dallas.

35:34.030 --> 35:35.588
I won't be there
to protect you.

35:35.630 --> 35:38.497
I don't need you.

35:38.530 --> 35:40.464
I can protect myself.

35:40.500 --> 35:42.468
*

35:42.500 --> 35:43.660
(scoffs)

35:43.700 --> 35:47.204
Camila, you are like
fire on steel.

35:47.240 --> 35:49.299
You know how to make
the most challenging men

35:49.340 --> 35:51.205
bend to your will.

35:51.250 --> 35:54.174
I speak from experience.

35:54.220 --> 35:55.847
Use that gift.

35:55.880 --> 35:57.848
It might keep you safe.

35:57.880 --> 36:04.888
*

36:18.670 --> 36:20.661
POTE: There's a Taco Bell.

36:20.710 --> 36:22.928
Does anybody need a chalupa?

36:25.050 --> 36:26.472
No.

36:26.510 --> 36:28.842
How about one
of those tall slushies?

36:28.880 --> 36:30.472
It's like a bump
of coke, man.

36:30.520 --> 36:32.181
It'll keep you awake
all the way to Phoenix.

36:32.220 --> 36:34.814
I'm good, thanks.
(sniffs)

36:34.860 --> 36:36.885
How about you, Teresita?

36:36.920 --> 36:39.184
I'm good, thank you.

36:39.230 --> 36:41.926
Guero, do you need something?

36:44.430 --> 36:45.920
Guero?

36:47.930 --> 36:49.636
Guero?

36:51.370 --> 36:53.258
Pote, he's not breathing.
Guero...

36:53.310 --> 36:56.199
-(car beeping)
TERESA: Guero? Guero?

36:56.240 --> 36:57.571
Guero--

36:57.610 --> 37:00.579
(somber music)

37:00.610 --> 37:07.618
*

37:20.770 --> 37:24.262
(wistful guitar music)

37:24.310 --> 37:27.234
Here you go.

37:27.270 --> 37:29.477
-Is it all for me?
-(chuckles)

37:29.510 --> 37:31.273
No, it's for us.

37:31.310 --> 37:32.743
It's your favorite--

37:32.780 --> 37:35.112
tres leches from that place
that Brenda likes.

37:35.150 --> 37:37.448
*

37:37.480 --> 37:39.414
-Mmm.
-How is it? (speaking Spanish)

37:39.450 --> 37:40.417
Mmm.

37:40.450 --> 37:43.487
*

37:43.520 --> 37:46.557
Hey, so, listen,
I know you've had it rough,

37:46.590 --> 37:49.491
all right, but you don't
have to worry anymore.

37:49.530 --> 37:51.919
Okay, what's mine is yours.

37:51.970 --> 37:54.939
I know you feel weird about me
giving you the house, but...

37:54.970 --> 37:57.438
(speaking Spanish)

37:57.470 --> 37:59.631
*

37:59.670 --> 38:01.479
Come here.

38:01.510 --> 38:08.439
*

38:34.210 --> 38:36.132
CORTEZ:
Gobernadora.

38:39.410 --> 38:41.878
You don't have to say it,
General, I know.

38:41.920 --> 38:43.876
Teresa's gone.

38:45.020 --> 38:46.317
I'm sorry.

38:48.890 --> 38:51.779
You know, your devotion...

38:51.830 --> 38:53.957
to me...

38:53.990 --> 38:56.788
it's not about power

38:56.830 --> 38:59.298
or about money.

38:59.330 --> 39:01.366
I know that now.

39:02.940 --> 39:06.137
You have become...family.

39:06.170 --> 39:08.400
I really hope that's true.

39:09.780 --> 39:11.668
Please...

39:11.710 --> 39:13.678
sit.

39:20.850 --> 39:22.249
Pozole.

39:22.290 --> 39:24.520
I don't cook often,

39:24.560 --> 39:27.051
but that happens to be
one of my specialties.

39:30.130 --> 39:33.099
(dark music)

39:33.130 --> 39:36.258
*

39:36.300 --> 39:39.406
(speaking Spanish)

39:39.440 --> 39:41.772
You have become
a very good friend

39:41.810 --> 39:43.698
to me, Alberto.

39:43.740 --> 39:46.777
Maybe we can be more.

39:46.810 --> 39:50.018
I mean, I'm still mourning,
and...

39:50.050 --> 39:51.779
I need to
take things slow,

39:51.820 --> 39:53.617
if that's okay by you.

39:53.650 --> 39:55.709
Of course.

39:55.760 --> 39:57.682
I'll follow your lead.

39:57.720 --> 40:00.086
*

40:00.130 --> 40:03.054
* Yo vivo para ti

40:03.100 --> 40:06.422

40:06.470 --> 40:09.564

40:17.640 --> 40:19.744

40:19.780 --> 40:24.649

40:24.690 --> 40:26.317

40:26.350 --> 40:29.751
* Yo me arriesgo para ti

40:29.790 --> 40:33.089

40:33.130 --> 40:36.429
