"LAST WEEK TONIGHT"

00:43.967 --> 00:44.967
I'M JOHN OLIVER.

00:45.033 --> 00:45.633
THANKS SO MUCH FOR JOINING US.

00:45.700 --> 00:46.400
AND WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH RUDY

00:46.467 --> 00:47.066
GIUILIANI, THE PRESIDENT'S

00:47.133 --> 00:47.633
LAWYER, AND A ONE-MAN LEGAL

00:47.700 --> 00:48.033
IMPROV TROUPE.

00:48.100 --> 00:48.700
GIULIANI WAS ON TV THIS MORNING,

00:48.767 --> 00:49.333
TO TALK ABOUT THE ONGOING

00:49.400 --> 00:50.133
MUELLER INVESTIGATION, AND CAME

00:50.200 --> 00:51.200
UP WITH A RATIONALE FOR HIS

00:51.266 --> 00:52.734
BOSS'S REFUSAL TO SIT DOWN WITH

00:52.800 --> 00:54.033
MUELLER THAT WAS, EVEN BY

00:54.100 --> 00:55.734
GIULIANI STANDARDS, VERY

00:55.800 --> 00:58.433
"GUILIANI".

00:58.500 --> 00:59.567
>> WHEN YOU TELL ME THAT HE

00:59.633 --> 01:01.066
SHOULD TESTIFY BECAUSE HE'S

01:01.133 --> 01:02.133
GOING TO TELL THE TRUTH, THAT HE

01:02.200 --> 01:03.066
SHOULDN'T WORRY, WELL THAT'S SO

01:03.133 --> 01:04.200
SILLY, BECAUSE IT'S SOMEBODY'S

01:04.266 --> 01:05.233
VERSION OF THE TRUTH, NOT THE

01:05.300 --> 01:07.567
TRUTH.

01:07.633 --> 01:08.300
HE DIDN'T HAVE A CONVERSATION

01:08.367 --> 01:09.166
ABOUT --

01:09.233 --> 01:10.133
>> TRUTH IS TRUTH.

01:10.200 --> 01:11.200
I DON'T MEAN TO GO, LIKE --

01:11.266 --> 01:11.967
>> NO, IT ISN'T TRUTH!

01:12.033 --> 01:13.300
TRUTH ISN'T TRUTH!

01:13.367 --> 01:14.734
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

01:14.800 --> 01:15.700
STATES SAYS -- I DIDN'T--

01:15.767 --> 01:17.033
>> TRUTH ISN'T TRUTH?

01:17.100 --> 01:19.800
MR. MAYOR, DO YOU REALIZE THAT--

01:19.867 --> 01:21.667
>> NO NO, NO, DON'T DO THIS TO

01:21.734 --> 01:26.400
ME.

01:26.467 --> 01:27.166
>> DON'T DO THIS TO YOU?

01:27.233 --> 01:27.700
YOU JUST SAID "TRUTH ISN'T

01:27.767 --> 01:32.100
TRUTH.

01:32.166 --> 01:32.667
THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE FROM A

01:32.734 --> 01:33.133
PRESIDENT'S LAWYER.

01:33.200 --> 01:33.934
IT'S BARELY ACCEPTABLE FROM A

01:34.000 --> 01:34.567
SOPHOMORE PHILOSOPHY MAJOR, WHO

01:34.633 --> 01:35.166
JUST TRIED MOLLY FOR THE FIRST

01:35.233 --> 01:36.667
TIME.

01:36.734 --> 01:38.600
>> TRUTH ISN'T TRUTH, AND ALSO

01:38.667 --> 01:39.834
TOES ARE JUST FEET FINGERS.

01:39.900 --> 01:42.500
I FEEL WARM!

01:42.567 --> 01:44.266
AND IN FAIRNESS TO GIULIANI --

01:44.333 --> 01:46.100
THE KEN BONE OF

01:46.166 --> 01:47.500
9/11 -- THAT WAS NOT THE DUMBEST

01:47.567 --> 01:48.734
THING HE SAID IN THE INTERVIEW.

01:48.800 --> 01:50.433
BECAUSE JUST WATCH THE

01:50.500 --> 01:52.100
PRESIDENT'S LAWYER -- WHOSE JOB

01:52.166 --> 01:53.400
IS ESSENTIALLY TO TRY AND

01:53.467 --> 01:54.567
DISMISS POTENTIALLY DAMNING

01:54.633 --> 01:55.967
EVIDENCE LIKE THE TRUMP

01:56.033 --> 01:57.033
TOWER MEETING -- BASICALLY DO

01:57.100 --> 01:59.000
THE EXACT OPPOSITE.

01:59.066 --> 02:02.533
>> THE TRUMP TOWER MEETING

02:02.600 --> 02:03.934
ITSELF IS AT LEAST EVIDENCE OF

02:04.000 --> 02:05.333
YOU BETTER INVESTIGATE.

02:05.400 --> 02:06.033
IT'S A --

02:06.100 --> 02:07.000
>> IT'S NOT.

02:07.066 --> 02:09.033
>> HOW IS IT NOT?

02:09.100 --> 02:10.800
>> BECAUSE THE MEETING WAS

02:10.867 --> 02:12.000
ORIGINALLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF

02:12.066 --> 02:13.433
GETTING INFORMATION ABOUT

02:13.500 --> 02:14.500
CLINTON.

02:14.567 --> 02:15.533
THE MEETING TURNED INTO A

02:15.600 --> 02:16.200
MEETING --

02:16.266 --> 02:16.934
>> WHICH IN ITSELF IS AN ATTEMPT

02:17.000 --> 02:18.567
AT COLLUSION.

02:18.633 --> 02:19.166
>> IT'S NOT.

02:19.233 --> 02:20.867
>> YOU JUST SAID IT.

02:20.934 --> 02:21.734
THE MEET WAS INTENDED TO GET

02:21.800 --> 02:22.934
DIRT ON HILLARY CLINTON FROM A

02:23.000 --> 02:23.734
KREMLIN LAWYER.

02:23.800 --> 02:24.533
>> NO, NO.

02:24.600 --> 02:25.600
>> THAT WAS THE INTENTION OF THE

02:25.667 --> 02:25.834
MEETING.

02:25.900 --> 02:27.200
YOU JUST SAID IT.

02:27.266 --> 02:27.834
>> John: WHAT'S RUDY GIULIANI

02:27.900 --> 02:29.433
DOING?

02:29.500 --> 02:30.467
AND WHY DOES THE WHITE HOUSE

02:30.533 --> 02:32.667
KEEP LETTING HIM GO ON TV?

02:32.734 --> 02:34.033
BECAUSE AT THIS RATE, DONALD

02:34.100 --> 02:35.767
TRUMP IS GOING TO WIND UP BEHIND

02:35.834 --> 02:37.000
BARS, WITH RUDY GIULIANI

02:37.066 --> 02:37.867
VISITING HIM AND GOING, "DON'T

02:37.934 --> 02:38.500
WORRY, DONALD -- PRISON ISN'T

02:38.567 --> 02:40.367
PRISON."

02:40.433 --> 02:41.400
BUT LET'S NOT GET SUCKED IN TO

02:41.467 --> 02:42.934
ALL THAT.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.600
INSTEAD, LET'S TURN TO

02:44.667 --> 02:45.934
AUSTRALIA, HOME OF EVERY ANIMAL

02:46.000 --> 02:46.567
THAT SEEMS LIKE IT SHOULD

02:46.633 --> 02:48.367
ALREADY BE EXTINCT.

02:48.433 --> 02:50.200
HOW IS THE PLATYPUS STILL ALIVE?

02:50.266 --> 02:51.200
IT LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING FRED

02:51.266 --> 02:51.834
FLINTSTONE WOULD HAVE USED AS A

02:51.900 --> 02:53.467
SWISS ARMY KNIFE.

02:53.533 --> 02:54.767
AUSTRALIAN POLITICS THIS WEEK

02:54.834 --> 02:56.467
SAW A DEBUT SPEECH IN PARLIAMENT

02:56.533 --> 02:57.734
FROM FRASER ANNING THAT WILL

02:57.800 --> 02:59.734
LIVE LONG IN THEIR MEMORY.

02:59.800 --> 03:01.266
>> A CROSSBENCH SENATOR HAS

03:01.333 --> 03:03.233
DELIVERED A PROVOCATIVE FIRST

03:03.300 --> 03:04.567
SPEECH TO PARLIAMENT, CALLING

03:04.633 --> 03:05.834
FOR A BAN ON MUSLIMS MIGRATING

03:05.900 --> 03:07.500
TO AUSTRALIA.

03:07.567 --> 03:09.066
FRASER ANNING ALSO USED THE TERM

03:09.133 --> 03:11.233
"FINAL SOLUTION" WHEN TALKING

03:11.300 --> 03:12.967
ABOUT IMMIGRATION, A PHRASE USED

03:13.033 --> 03:17.567
BY HITLER IN NAZI GERMANY.

03:17.633 --> 03:18.367
>> John: IT'S TRUE.

03:18.433 --> 03:19.533
IN A SPEECH ARGUING IN FAVOR OF

03:19.600 --> 03:20.200
A RETURN TO A "WHITE AUSTRALIA

03:20.266 --> 03:21.400
POLICY", ANNING SUGGESTED HAVING

03:21.467 --> 03:23.000
A POPULAR VOTE WOULD BE A GOOD

03:23.066 --> 03:25.066
"FINAL SOLUTION".

03:25.133 --> 03:27.367
AND THAT'S JUST NOT A PHRASE YOU

03:27.433 --> 03:28.000
THROW AROUND FOR PRETTY OBVIOUS

03:28.066 --> 03:29.667
REASONS.

03:29.734 --> 03:31.567
IT'S THE SAME REASON WE DON'T

03:31.633 --> 03:33.600
NAME BABIES ADOLF, HAVE TINY

03:33.667 --> 03:35.133
MUSTACHES, OR CALL YOGA RETREATS

03:35.200 --> 03:36.233
"CONCENTRATION CAMPS."

03:36.300 --> 03:38.200
WE COULD!

03:38.266 --> 03:38.934
BUT PEOPLE WOULD BE

03:39.000 --> 03:41.133
UNDERSTANDABLY UPSET.

03:41.200 --> 03:41.867
BUT NOT ONLY DID ANNING REFUSE

03:41.934 --> 03:43.166
TO APOLOGIZE, THE HEAD OF HIS

03:43.233 --> 03:45.166
PARTY BACKED HIM UP.

03:45.233 --> 03:46.166
>> DO YOU SUPPORT FRASER

03:46.233 --> 03:48.700
ANNING'S COMMENTS?

03:48.767 --> 03:50.000
>> ABSOLUTELY, ONE THOUSAND

03:50.066 --> 03:53.800
PERCENT.

03:53.867 --> 03:54.767
I SUPPORT EVERYTHING HE SAID.

03:54.834 --> 03:55.333
IT WAS A MAGNIFICENT SPEECH.

03:55.400 --> 03:57.700
IT WAS SOLID GOLD.

03:57.767 --> 03:59.000
AND HE STUMBLED ON A BIT OF A

03:59.066 --> 04:02.700
MALAPROPISM THERE, AND HEY, HE

04:02.767 --> 04:04.467
DIDN'T GO TO UNIVERSITY.

04:04.533 --> 04:05.934
HE DIDN'T GO TO UNIVERSITY TO

04:06.000 --> 04:06.600
LEARN THE SIGNIFICANCE OF ALL

04:06.667 --> 04:09.533
THESE WORDS.

04:09.600 --> 04:10.767
>> John: FIRST, THE SPEECH WAS

04:10.834 --> 04:11.800
NOT "SOLID GOLD".

04:11.867 --> 04:13.533
AND I REALLY HOPE IN AUSTRALIA,

04:13.600 --> 04:14.133
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO TO

04:14.200 --> 04:15.066
UNIVERSITY TO HAVE HEARD ABOUT

04:15.133 --> 04:16.834
THE HOLOCAUST.

04:16.900 --> 04:18.700
LOOK, HE BEARS NO RESPONSIBILITY

04:18.767 --> 04:19.500
FOR THE WORDS HE USES.

04:19.567 --> 04:21.200
HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT THEY MEAN!

04:21.266 --> 04:22.667
IF YOU GAVE 1,000 MONKEYS 1,000

04:22.734 --> 04:25.200
TYPEWRITERS, AND ONE OF THEM

04:25.266 --> 04:26.000
WROTE "HEIL HITLER," WOULD YOU

04:26.066 --> 04:26.500
GET ALL ANGRY WITH HIM?

04:26.567 --> 04:26.834
NO!

04:26.900 --> 04:33.400
YOU'D BE IMPRESSED!

04:33.467 --> 04:35.700
THAT'S A SOLID GOLD MONKEY RIGHT

04:35.767 --> 04:36.567
THERE.

04:36.633 --> 04:37.800
THAT MAN IS BOB KATTER-- HEAD OF

04:37.867 --> 04:38.266
THE SELFNAMED KATTER'S

04:38.333 --> 04:39.133
AUSTRALIAN PARTY -- WHO HAS A

04:39.200 --> 04:39.734
TEMPERAMENT TO MATCH HIS FACE.

04:39.800 --> 04:40.800
JUST TAKE A LOOK AT THE HOSTILE

04:40.867 --> 04:42.967
TONE OF A PREVIOUS CAMPAIGN AD.

04:43.033 --> 04:44.133
>> ONE AUSTRALIAN LAWMAKER HAS

04:44.200 --> 04:46.734
COME UNDER FIRE FOR THE BAD

04:46.800 --> 04:47.600
TIMING OF HIS NEW CAMPAIGN

04:47.667 --> 04:49.066
VIDEO, A MOCK EXECUTION OF HIS

04:49.133 --> 04:51.033
POLITICAL OPPONENTS, SHOWING HIM

04:51.100 --> 04:55.567
BLOWING A SMOKING GUN AS

04:55.633 --> 04:56.133
LIFELESS BODIES LIE IN THE

04:56.200 --> 04:56.834
BACKGROUND.

04:56.900 --> 04:57.433
>> John: WOW.

04:57.500 --> 05:00.400
I HAVEN'T SEEN A COMMERCIAL THAT

05:00.467 --> 05:01.133
EXTREME SINCE THE GEICO GECKO

05:01.200 --> 05:02.767
SLIT THE AFFLAC DUCK'S THROAT.

05:02.834 --> 05:03.433
YOU WENT TOO FAR, YOU LITTLE

05:03.500 --> 05:05.433
SHIT.

05:05.500 --> 05:06.633
BUT UNDERNEATH HIS ECCENTRIC

05:06.700 --> 05:08.700
PERSONALITY IS THE HEART OF A

05:08.767 --> 05:11.400
TRULY UNPLEASANT HUMAN BEING.

05:11.467 --> 05:13.333
LAST YEAR, HE SAID --

05:13.400 --> 05:14.100
IT IS IMPERATIVE THE PEOPLE FROM

05:14.166 --> 05:14.700
THE MIDDLE

05:14.767 --> 05:15.767
EAST AND NORTH AFRICA ARE BARRED

05:15.834 --> 05:16.567
FROM ENTERING AUSTRALIA

05:16.633 --> 05:17.367
AND THIS WEEK, WHEN QUESTIONED

05:17.433 --> 05:17.967
ABOUT FRASER ANNING'S

05:18.033 --> 05:19.533
COMMENTS, HE SAID THIS.

05:19.600 --> 05:20.667
>> ARE WE RACIST?

05:20.734 --> 05:22.300
WELL, WE'RE AUSTRALIANS.

05:22.367 --> 05:23.767
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S RACIST OR

05:23.834 --> 05:24.834
NOT, BUT WE'RE NOT APOLOGIZING

05:24.900 --> 05:27.600
FOR IT TO ANYONE.

05:27.667 --> 05:32.300
>> John: YOU ARE AND IT IS.

05:32.367 --> 05:32.767
AND LOOK.

05:32.834 --> 05:33.367
I'M NOT SAYING ALL AUSTRALIANS

05:33.433 --> 05:34.000
ARE RACIST.

05:34.066 --> 05:34.467
THAT WOULD BE RACIST.

05:34.533 --> 05:35.266
AND I WOULD NEVER SAY SOMETHING

05:35.333 --> 05:35.800
LIKE THAT, BECAUSE I'M NOT

05:35.867 --> 05:37.967
AUSTRALIAN.

05:38.033 --> 05:39.133
BUT IN FAIRNESS TO KATTER: HE'S

05:39.200 --> 05:40.400
NOT JUST RACIST.

05:40.467 --> 05:41.967
HE'S ALSO HOMOPHOBIC.

05:42.033 --> 05:43.600
IN 2011, HE SAID GAY MARRIAGE

05:43.667 --> 05:45.100
SHOULD BE RIDICULED, AND WHEN

05:45.166 --> 05:52.967
AUSTRALIA APPROVED SAME-SEX

05:53.033 --> 05:53.800
MARRIAGE LAST YEAR, HE TRIED TO

05:53.867 --> 05:54.567
LAUGH IT OFF, BEFORE DOING A

05:54.633 --> 05:55.400
HARD EMOTIONAL TURN.

05:55.467 --> 05:56.400
>> YOU KNOW, PEOPLE ARE ENTITLED

05:56.467 --> 05:57.734
TO THEIR SEXUAL PROCLIVITIES.

05:57.800 --> 05:59.400
I MEAN, LET THERE BE A THOUSAND

05:59.467 --> 06:00.000
BLOSSOMS BLOOM AS FAR AS I'M

06:00.066 --> 06:01.867
CONCERNED.

06:01.934 --> 06:03.567
BUT I AIN'T SPENDING ANY TIME ON

06:03.633 --> 06:05.967
IT, BECAUSE IN THE MEANTIME,

06:06.033 --> 06:08.300
EVERY THREE MONTHS, A PERSON IS

06:08.367 --> 06:09.266
TORN TO PIECES BY A CROCODILE IN

06:09.333 --> 06:12.066
NORTH QUEENSLAND.

06:12.133 --> 06:13.300
>> John: OKAY, YOU CANNOT

06:13.367 --> 06:14.166
DEFLECT FROM A QUESTION OF

06:14.233 --> 06:15.066
CIVIL RIGHTS WITH A WEIRD ANIMAL

06:15.133 --> 06:16.166
FACT.

06:16.233 --> 06:17.600
PEOPLE ARE ENTITLED TO BE

06:17.667 --> 06:18.700
WORRIED ABOUT VOTER SUPPRESSION,

06:18.767 --> 06:20.166
THAT'S FINE.

06:20.233 --> 06:21.300
BUT I AIN'T SPENDING ANY TIME ON

06:21.367 --> 06:22.367
IT WHEN GIRAFFES ARE

06:22.433 --> 06:23.100
WALKING AROUND WITH BLACK

06:23.166 --> 06:27.734
TONGUES ALL DAY.

06:27.800 --> 06:31.333
IT'S A DISGRACE.

06:31.400 --> 06:32.000
AND LOOK, I COULD SPEND ALL

06:32.066 --> 06:32.633
NIGHT SHOWING YOU CLIPS OF

06:32.700 --> 06:33.266
KATTER BEING TERRIBLE.

06:33.333 --> 06:34.266
BUT I JUST WANT TO SHOW YOU ONE

06:34.333 --> 06:34.600
MORE.

06:34.667 --> 06:35.333
BECAUSE HIS OBJECTION TO

06:35.400 --> 06:36.767
SAME-SEX MARRIAGE ISN'T JUST

06:36.834 --> 06:37.467
THAT IT DISTRACTS FROM

06:37.533 --> 06:38.033
CROC-ONBLOKE CRIME.

06:38.100 --> 06:40.000
IT'S ALSO BECAUSE OF THIS.

06:40.066 --> 06:41.233
>> THE HOMOSEXUAL GROUPINGS IN

06:41.300 --> 06:42.000
AUSTRALIA, THEY TOOK THE WORD

06:42.066 --> 06:45.133
"GAY."

06:45.200 --> 06:46.200
IT WAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WORD

06:46.266 --> 06:46.834
IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE, AND

06:46.900 --> 06:47.767
THEY SAID, "OH GOOD!

06:47.834 --> 06:53.033
WE'LL TAKE THAT WORD!

06:53.100 --> 06:54.567
AND WE'LL HAVE IT AS OURS!"

06:54.633 --> 06:55.533
CALLED MARRIAGE, THE OTHER MOB,

06:55.600 --> 06:56.667
OH, WELL, WE'LL TAKE THAT, TOO,

06:56.734 --> 06:57.333
Y'KNOW? WELL, WHAT ELSE ARE THEY

06:57.400 --> 06:58.867
GONNA TAKE?

06:58.934 --> 06:59.633
>> John: OH, I DON'T KNOW --

06:59.700 --> 07:00.567
NOTHING?

07:00.633 --> 07:01.767
BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T TAKE THE

07:01.834 --> 07:02.633
WORDS "GAY" OR "MARRIAGE" IN THE

07:02.700 --> 07:03.600
FIRST PLACE.

07:03.667 --> 07:05.333
WORDS CAN EVOLVE OVER TIME, AND

07:05.400 --> 07:06.533
BE USED IN NEW CONTEXTS.

07:06.600 --> 07:07.700
THERE ARE VERY FEW EXCEPTIONS TO

07:07.767 --> 07:09.300
THAT RULE.

07:09.367 --> 07:12.533
CAN YOU THINK OF ONE?

07:12.600 --> 07:13.934
I CAN, AND IF YOU THINK HARD

07:14.033 --> 07:15.367
ENOUGH, I'M SURE YOU'LL COME UP

07:15.433 --> 07:17.633
WITH A FINAL SOLUTION.

07:17.700 --> 07:23.500
AND NOW THIS.

07:23.567 --> 07:25.467
>> AND NOW, THE HOLIDAY LOCAL

07:25.533 --> 07:27.900
NEWS TEAMS DREAD.

07:27.967 --> 07:29.600
>> LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IF YOU

07:29.667 --> 07:30.567
DIDN'T KNOW IT.

07:30.633 --> 07:32.433
IT IS NATIONAL TELL A JOKE DAY.

07:32.500 --> 07:36.900
>> OH, YAY, GREG.

07:36.967 --> 07:38.500
>> TOMORROW IS NATIONAL JOKE

07:38.567 --> 07:38.667
DAY.

07:38.734 --> 07:41.900
>> OH, NO.

07:41.967 --> 07:45.300
>> WHAT KIND OF GENES DOES IT

07:45.367 --> 07:46.500
JAWS WHERE?

07:46.567 --> 07:46.834
DENIM, DENIM.

07:46.900 --> 07:49.333
>> WHY COULDN'T THE TOILET PAPER

07:49.400 --> 07:49.734
ACROSS THE STREET?

07:49.800 --> 07:51.934
>> HE GOT STUCK IN A CRACK.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.133
>> WOW.

07:53.200 --> 07:54.066
REALLY GOING FOR IT.

07:54.133 --> 07:57.533
>> WHY DOES SNOOP DOGG NEED AN

07:57.600 --> 07:57.900
UMBRELLA?

07:57.967 --> 08:00.734
>> GOSH, THIS IS LIKE A

08:00.800 --> 08:01.233
SLOW-MOVING CAR CRASH.

08:01.300 --> 08:02.967
>> YOU KNOW THE REASON THAT

08:03.033 --> 08:04.900
SNOOP DOGG HAS HIS UMBRELLA

08:04.967 --> 08:05.133
AROUND.

08:05.200 --> 08:06.934
>> BECAUSE?

08:07.000 --> 08:11.900
>> FO DRIZZLE.

08:11.967 --> 08:12.700
>> OKAY.

08:12.767 --> 08:14.967
>> WHY DID SNOOP DOGG NEED AN

08:15.033 --> 08:17.800
UMBRELLA?

08:17.867 --> 08:21.367
>> FO DRIZZLE.

08:21.433 --> 08:23.133
>> IT IS NATIONAL TELL A JOKE

08:23.200 --> 08:23.300
DAY.

08:23.367 --> 08:29.433
>> COME IS IT?

08:29.500 --> 08:29.967
>> John: MOVING ON.

08:30.033 --> 08:30.600
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

08:30.667 --> 08:31.233
THE BASIC SYSTEM OF BARTER AND

08:31.300 --> 08:31.834
EXCHANGE THAT YOU HAVE TO DO

08:31.900 --> 08:32.400
REALLY CAREFULLY, OR YOU'LL

08:32.467 --> 08:32.934
END UP WITH DWIGHT HOWARD.

08:33.000 --> 08:33.600
SERIOUSLY, PARENTS, TALK TO YOUR

08:33.667 --> 08:34.700
CHILDREN ABOUT TRADE.

08:34.767 --> 08:36.233
YOU DON'T WANT THEM GOING TO

08:36.300 --> 08:37.400
SCHOOL WITH PIZZA LUNCHABLES AND

08:37.467 --> 08:38.834
COMING HOME WITH DWIGHT HOWARD.

08:38.900 --> 08:40.400
YOU THINK HE'S GOING TO ADD A

08:40.467 --> 08:41.066
THREE POINT

08:41.133 --> 08:42.433
SHOT NOW?

08:42.500 --> 08:44.033
GROW UP.

08:44.100 --> 08:45.367
TRADE IS A SUBJECT ON WHICH OUR

08:45.433 --> 08:47.467
CURRENT PRESIDENT CONSIDERS

08:47.533 --> 08:57.867
HIMSELF PARTICULARLY EXPERT.

08:57.934 --> 08:58.900
>> TRADE THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA

08:58.967 --> 08:59.233
DO.

08:59.300 --> 08:59.900
I'M GONNA DO

08:59.967 --> 09:00.600
SO GOOD.

09:00.667 --> 09:01.233
I'LL TAKE THOSE TRADE DEALS AND

09:01.300 --> 09:01.867
MAKE THEM SO GOOD THAT'S WHAT I

09:01.934 --> 09:02.033
DO.

09:02.100 --> 09:02.800
I LOVE TAKING BAD DEALS AND

09:02.867 --> 09:05.533
MAKING THEM GOOD.

09:05.600 --> 09:06.300
I LOVE TRADE.

09:06.367 --> 09:06.934
YOU KNOW TRADE'S ALWAYS BEEN MY

09:07.000 --> 09:07.700
THING.

09:07.767 --> 09:09.266
I COULD NAME TEN DIFFERENT FORMS

09:09.333 --> 09:09.533
OF TRADE.

09:09.600 --> 09:10.066
I KNOW EVERY ONE OF THEM.

09:10.133 --> 09:10.700
HEY THE WHARTON SCHOOL OFFINANCE

09:10.767 --> 09:11.867
RIGHT HERE.

09:11.934 --> 09:12.500
>> John: YEAH, I CAN NAME TEN

09:12.567 --> 09:13.100
FORMS OF TRADE: THERE'S FREE

09:13.166 --> 09:13.734
TRADE, FAIR TRADE, ROUGH TRADE,

09:13.800 --> 09:14.433
TRADER JOE'S.

09:14.500 --> 09:14.867
THAT'S WHAT, EIGHT?

09:14.934 --> 09:15.567
THEN THERE'S HUMAN TRAFFICKING,

09:15.633 --> 09:16.200
THAT'S LIKE TRADING FOR PEOPLE.

09:16.266 --> 09:19.233
WE'LL ROUND UP AND CALL IT TEN.

09:19.300 --> 09:19.867
WHARTON SCHOOL OF FINANCE, RIGHT

09:19.934 --> 09:20.133
HERE!

09:20.200 --> 09:20.867
TRUMP HAS TALKED A BIG GAME ON

09:20.934 --> 09:21.433
TRADE FOR DECADES.

09:21.500 --> 09:22.033
AND HE'S SPENT THIS YEAR

09:22.100 --> 09:22.734
SLAPPING TARIFFS ON PRODUCTS

09:22.800 --> 09:23.367
FROM CHINA, CANADA, THE E-U, AND

09:23.433 --> 09:26.066
OTHERS, PROMPTING THEM TO

09:26.133 --> 09:26.700
RETALIATE WITH TARIFFS OF THEIR

09:26.767 --> 09:32.467
OWN.

09:32.533 --> 09:33.100
AND THIS TRADE WAR HAS ESCALATED

09:33.166 --> 09:33.800
FAST -- FROM TARIFFS ON 18

09:33.867 --> 09:34.367
PRODUCTS AT THE START OF THE

09:34.433 --> 09:35.033
YEAR TO NOW OVER 10,000.

09:35.100 --> 09:35.600
SO THINGS HAVE GOTTEN PRETTY

09:35.667 --> 09:36.266
SERIOUS.

09:36.333 --> 09:36.900
AND AMERICAN WORKERS ARE ALREADY

09:36.967 --> 09:37.500
BEING IMPACTED -- PARTICULARLY

09:37.567 --> 09:38.967
IN AGRICULTURE.

09:39.033 --> 09:41.000
>> WE'RE FEELING A LOT OF PAIN

09:41.066 --> 09:45.433
RIGHT NOW IN THE FARM SECTOR.

09:45.500 --> 09:46.066
>> IT'S AFFECTING FARMERS IN A

09:46.133 --> 09:47.133
NEGATIVE WAY.

09:47.200 --> 09:48.133
>> I ALWAYS HOPE THAT ONE

09:48.200 --> 09:49.967
MORNING, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S JUST

09:50.033 --> 09:51.633
GONNA WAKE UP AND SEND OUT THAT

09:51.700 --> 09:53.066
3:30 IN THE MORNING TWEET

09:53.133 --> 09:55.100
THAT SAYS "TARIFFS ARE GONE."

09:55.166 --> 09:57.667
>> John: WOW THAT'S DEPRESSING.

09:57.734 --> 09:59.066
THAT GUY'S LIVELIHOOD DEPENDS ON

09:59.133 --> 10:03.367
A TWEET THAT SAYS "TARIFFS ARE

10:03.433 --> 10:03.867
GONE."

10:03.934 --> 10:04.734
AND EVEN IF TRUMP DOES END UP

10:04.800 --> 10:05.467
DOING THAT AT 3:30 IN THE

10:05.533 --> 10:06.767
MORNING, YOU JUST KNOW IT'LL SAY

10:06.834 --> 10:09.000
"TARIFS APE GOON", AND WE'LL ALL

10:09.066 --> 10:09.800
HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT HE MEANT.

10:09.867 --> 10:10.967
SO TONIGHT, BEFORE THINGS GET

10:11.033 --> 10:11.800
MUCH WORSE, LET'S LOOK AT THIS

10:11.867 --> 10:13.233
TRADE WAR.

10:13.300 --> 10:14.400
BECAUSE IT'S TEMPTING TO THINK

10:14.467 --> 10:16.433
THAT TRUMP HAS A PLAN.

10:16.500 --> 10:18.633
AFTER ALL, TRADE IS HIS THING.

10:18.700 --> 10:19.500
AND HE'S TWEETED, "TRADE WARS

10:19.567 --> 10:25.633
ARE GOOD AND EASY TO WIN."

10:25.700 --> 10:29.300
BUT FOR YEARS, HIS STRATEGY ON

10:29.367 --> 10:30.000
THAT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN BASED

10:30.066 --> 10:30.500
AROUND LITTLE MORE THAN

10:30.567 --> 10:31.500
TONE OF VOICE.

10:31.567 --> 10:32.300
>> SO EASY.

10:32.367 --> 10:35.767
I'D DROP A TWENTY-FIVE PERCENT

10:35.834 --> 10:38.266
TAX ON CHINA.

10:38.333 --> 10:38.934
AND I SAID TO SOMEBODY THAT IT'S

10:39.000 --> 10:39.467
REALLY THE MESSENGER.

10:39.533 --> 10:41.767
THE MESSENGER IS IMPORTANT.

10:41.834 --> 10:50.600
I COULD HAVE ONE MAN SAY, "WE'RE

10:50.667 --> 10:51.133
GONNA TAX YOU TWENTY-FIVE

10:51.200 --> 10:51.633
PERCENT."

10:51.700 --> 10:52.266
AND I COULD HAVE ANOTHER SAY

10:52.333 --> 10:55.500
"LISTEN YOU MOTHERFUCKERS, WE'RE

10:55.567 --> 10:56.033
GONNA TAX YOU TWENTY FIVE

10:56.100 --> 10:58.033
PERCENT."

10:58.100 --> 10:58.767
>> John: OH, I SEE.

10:58.834 --> 10:59.600
SO THE TONE'S IMPORTANT.

10:59.667 --> 11:00.700
IF I WERE TO SAY TO SOMEBODY,

11:00.767 --> 11:01.700
"THAT'S NOT HOW TRADE

11:01.767 --> 11:02.934
NEGOTIATIONS WORK," THAT'D BE

11:03.000 --> 11:03.800
ONE THING.

11:03.867 --> 11:04.567
IF I WERE TO SAY, "THAT'S NOT

11:04.633 --> 11:05.300
HOW TRADE NEGOTIATIONS WORK, YOU

11:05.367 --> 11:06.133
DUMB MOTHERFUCKER," THAT WOULD

11:06.200 --> 11:06.800
BE MORE EFFECTIVE.

11:06.867 --> 11:07.667
THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW.

11:07.734 --> 11:10.567
BECAUSE FOR ALL TRUMP'S

11:10.633 --> 11:11.300
CONFIDENCE, THERE ARE SOME VERY

11:11.367 --> 11:12.000
BASIC THINGS ABOUT ECONOMICS

11:12.066 --> 11:12.900
THAT HE SEEMS GENUINELY CONFUSED

11:12.967 --> 11:13.767
BY.

11:13.834 --> 11:15.133
TAKE TARIFFS.

11:15.200 --> 11:16.100
TRUMP ONCE TWEETED THAT IF THE

11:16.166 --> 11:18.600
TRADE WAR DOESN'T END, OTHER

11:18.667 --> 11:20.533
COUNTRIES "WILL PLAY US VAST

11:20.600 --> 11:21.200
SUMS OF MONEY IN THE FORM OF

11:21.266 --> 11:21.834
TARIFFS.

11:21.900 --> 11:24.367
WE WIN EITHER WAY."

11:24.433 --> 11:27.834
BUT THAT'S NOT HOW TARIFFS WORK.

11:27.900 --> 11:29.200
TARIFFS WILL MAKE OUR COUNTRY

11:29.266 --> 11:36.500
MUCH RICHER THAN IT IS TODAY.

11:36.567 --> 11:38.867
OTHER COUNTRIES DON'T PAY US

11:38.934 --> 11:40.033
TARIFFS, IMPORTERS DO WHEN THEY

11:40.100 --> 11:42.433
RECEIVE THE GOODS, AND THEY PASS

11:42.500 --> 11:45.900
THAT ALONG TO THE CONSUMER.

11:45.967 --> 11:46.900
YOU ARE PROBABLY GOING TO PAY

11:46.967 --> 11:52.834
MORE FOR IT.

11:52.900 --> 11:53.533
AS REPORTERS HAVE BEEN TRYING TO

11:53.600 --> 11:54.333
EXPLAIN, IN THE MOST LITERAL WAY

11:54.400 --> 11:57.500
POSSIBLE.

11:57.567 --> 11:58.133
>> HERE IN THE KITCHEN, MADE IN

11:58.200 --> 11:58.867
CHINA UTENSILS AND APPLIANCES

11:58.934 --> 11:59.500
LIKE STOVES ARE BEING TARGETED.

11:59.567 --> 12:00.033
UPSTAIRS IN THE BATHROOM,

12:00.100 --> 12:00.600
EVERYDAY ITEMS LIKE SHAMPOO,

12:00.667 --> 12:01.133
NAIL CLIPPERS, MAKEUP AND

12:01.200 --> 12:03.233
TOWELS.

12:03.300 --> 12:03.867
>> IT COULD MEAN HIGHER PRICES

12:03.934 --> 12:04.500
FOR THINGS LIKE INSTANT COFFEE

12:04.567 --> 12:05.000
AND THIS HARLEY DAVIDSON

12:05.066 --> 12:07.367
MOTORCYCLE.

12:07.433 --> 12:08.000
>> EVERYDAY ITEMS LIKE THE IPAD

12:08.066 --> 12:08.600
COULD BE HIT.

12:08.667 --> 12:09.133
THE TABLET HAS A CHIP FROM

12:09.200 --> 12:10.567
INTEL, WHICH COULD BE A TARGET.

12:10.633 --> 12:11.333
E-SCOOTERS HAVE TAKEN OFF THIS

12:11.400 --> 12:12.767
YEAR.

12:12.834 --> 12:14.200
NOW THEY FACE A 25 PERCENT

12:14.266 --> 12:15.767
TARIFF.

12:15.834 --> 12:17.967
>> John: OKAY, I HAVE TO ADMIT,

12:18.033 --> 12:19.667
IF ONE OF THE KEY CASUALTIES OF

12:19.734 --> 12:21.300
THIS TRADE WAR IS E-SCOOTERS, I

12:21.367 --> 12:24.066
THINK I'M FINE WITH THAT.

12:24.133 --> 12:25.333
THEY'RE BASICALLY IF

12:25.400 --> 12:26.033
DANE COOK SOMEHOW BECAME

12:26.100 --> 12:28.367
TRANSPORTATION.

12:28.433 --> 12:30.000
AND IT'S NOT JUST TARIFFS THAT

12:30.066 --> 12:31.433
TRUMP SEEMS TO MISUNDERSTAND.

12:31.500 --> 12:33.633
THERE'S ALSO OUR TRADE DEFICIT.

12:33.700 --> 12:34.967
BASICALLY, THE NUMBER THAT

12:35.033 --> 12:35.700
EXPRESSES HOW MUCH MORE WE BUY

12:35.767 --> 12:36.667
FROM OTHER COUNTRIES, THAN THEY

12:36.734 --> 12:38.367
BUY FROM US.

12:38.433 --> 12:39.934
TRUMP TALKS ABOUT IT ALL THE

12:40.000 --> 12:42.367
TIME, USUALLY LIKE THIS.

12:42.433 --> 12:45.934
>> OUR TRADE DEFICIT BALLOONED

12:46.000 --> 12:50.033
TO $817 BILLION DOLLARS.

12:50.100 --> 12:56.667
THINK OF THAT.

12:56.734 --> 12:57.333
WE LOST $817 BILLION DOLLARS A

12:57.400 --> 12:58.500
YEAR OVER THE LAST NUMBER OF

12:58.567 --> 13:00.734
YEARS.

13:00.800 --> 13:02.967
IN TRADE.

13:03.033 --> 13:05.734
IN OTHER WORDS, IF WE DIDN'T

13:05.800 --> 13:06.967
TRADE, WE'D SAVE A HELL OF A LOT

13:07.033 --> 13:08.633
OF MONEY.

13:08.700 --> 13:09.266
>> John: OKAY, THERE'S A LOT TO

13:09.333 --> 13:10.900
UNPACK THERE.

13:10.967 --> 13:12.800
FIRST, OUR TRADE DEFICIT IS

13:12.867 --> 13:14.333
ACTUALLY ABOUT $552 BILLION.

13:14.400 --> 13:15.367
SO HE WAS OFF BY A

13:15.433 --> 13:17.333
QUARTER-TRILLION DOLLARS --

13:17.400 --> 13:18.133
WHARTON SCHOOL OF FINANCE, RIGHT

13:18.200 --> 13:20.166
THERE!

13:20.233 --> 13:21.367
TRADE DEFICITS AREN'T ACTUALLY

13:21.433 --> 13:22.467
ALWAYS BAD.

13:22.533 --> 13:23.567
AND MANY ECONOMISTS BELIEVE --

13:23.633 --> 13:24.834
FOR VERY COMPLEX REASONS

13:24.900 --> 13:25.533
INVOLVING SAVINGS RATES AND

13:25.600 --> 13:26.700
THE DOLLAR'S SPECIAL STATUS AS

13:26.767 --> 13:27.667
THE WORLD'S RESERVE CURRENCY --

13:27.734 --> 13:29.233
AMERICA'S TRADE BALANCE

13:29.300 --> 13:30.433
MIGHT BE MORE OR LESS WHERE IT

13:30.500 --> 13:31.533
SHOULD BE.

13:31.600 --> 13:32.800
AND FINALLY -- AND THIS IS

13:32.867 --> 13:34.367
IMPORTANT -- WHEN WE

13:34.433 --> 13:35.066
HAVE A TRADE DEFICIT, WE DON'T

13:35.133 --> 13:36.400
"LOSE MONEY."

13:36.467 --> 13:37.667
IT'S NOT A BIG PILE OF CASH THAT

13:37.734 --> 13:39.100
WE HANDED OVER.

13:39.166 --> 13:39.633
WE BOUGHT THINGS, THAT WE

13:39.700 --> 13:41.467
RECEIVED.

13:41.533 --> 13:42.934
AND I'M NOT SAYING IT WAS ALL

13:43.000 --> 13:44.400
VALUABLE -- DOES ANYONE REALLY

13:44.467 --> 13:46.734
NEED THE "PONY UP DADDY SADDLE,"

13:46.800 --> 13:47.600
WHICH ALLOWS YOUR CHILD TO

13:47.667 --> 13:48.433
SYMBOLIZE THEIR NEW-FOUND

13:48.500 --> 13:50.200
DOMINANCE OVER YOUR LIFE?

13:50.266 --> 13:51.233
NO, I DIDN'T NEED IT, BUT I

13:51.300 --> 13:52.633
"WANTED" IT, AND HONESTLY, IT'S

13:52.700 --> 13:53.433
BROUGHT MY DAD AND ME CLOSER

13:53.500 --> 13:56.533
TOGETHER.

13:56.600 --> 13:58.233
AND EVEN THE WORLD LEADERS

13:58.300 --> 13:59.400
TRUMP'S BEEN FIGHTING WITH SEEM

13:59.467 --> 14:00.500
ALARMED BY HOW LITTLE HE

14:00.567 --> 14:02.533
UNDERSTANDS TRADE.

14:02.600 --> 14:04.066
JEAN-CLAUDE JUNCKER REPORTEDLY

14:04.133 --> 14:06.700
MET TRUMP ARMED WITH A SERIES OF

14:06.767 --> 14:07.467
COLORFUL, SIMPLE FLASH CARDS TO

14:07.533 --> 14:09.700
EXPLAIN THE TRADE WAR.

14:09.767 --> 14:10.800
AND THE WORD THAT REALLY GETS ME

14:10.867 --> 14:13.800
THERE IS "COLORFUL."

14:13.867 --> 14:15.200
BECAUSE THAT MEANS THEY HAD

14:15.266 --> 14:16.400
SOME SIMPLE FLASH CARDS AND

14:16.467 --> 14:18.100
THOUGHT "TOO WONKY.

14:18.166 --> 14:19.066
LET'S GET SOME BIG FUN BABY

14:19.133 --> 14:22.133
COLORS ON THOSE THINGS."

14:22.200 --> 14:23.433
AND ANGELA MERKEL STRUGGLED TO

14:23.500 --> 14:24.300
EXPLAIN SOMETHING EVEN MORE

14:24.367 --> 14:27.734
BASIC.

14:27.800 --> 14:28.400
THE INDEPENDENT NEWSPAPER CITING

14:28.467 --> 14:29.567
AN UNNAMED SENIOR GERMAN

14:29.633 --> 14:31.066
OFFICIAL, TEN TIMES TRUMP ASKED

14:31.133 --> 14:32.266
MS. MERKEL IF HE COULD NEGOTIATE

14:32.333 --> 14:34.000
A TRADE DEAL WITH GERMANY.

14:34.066 --> 14:35.100
EVERY TIME SHE

14:35.166 --> 14:36.100
REPLIED, "YOU CAN'T DO A TRADE

14:36.166 --> 14:39.467
DEAL WITH GERMANY.

14:39.533 --> 14:40.066
ONLY THE E.U.

14:40.133 --> 14:40.667
ON THE ELEVENTH REFUSAL, TRUMP

14:40.734 --> 14:41.900
FINALLY GOT THE MESSAGE.

14:41.967 --> 14:42.567
"OH, WE'LL DO A DEAL WITH EUROPE

14:42.633 --> 14:44.300
THEN."

14:44.367 --> 14:45.233
>> John: HE UNDERSTOOD, BUT ONLY

14:45.300 --> 14:46.900
AFTER THE ELEVENTH REFUSAL!

14:46.967 --> 14:47.667
JUST LISTEN TO WHAT THAT SOUNDS

14:47.734 --> 14:49.266
LIKE.

14:49.333 --> 14:50.934
>> HUH?

14:51.000 --> 14:52.133
HUH?

14:52.200 --> 14:53.266
HUH?

14:53.333 --> 14:54.600
HUH?

14:54.667 --> 14:56.066
HUH?

14:56.133 --> 15:01.467
HUH?

15:01.533 --> 15:03.367
DEAL WITH EUROPE.

15:03.433 --> 15:04.200
HUH?

15:04.266 --> 15:05.867
DEAL WITH EUROPE.

15:05.934 --> 15:06.567
HUH?

15:06.633 --> 15:10.767
DEAL WITH EUROPE.

15:10.834 --> 15:12.900
OKAY, I'LL DEAL WITH EUROPE.

15:12.967 --> 15:13.567
>> John: HONESTLY, I'M JUST

15:13.633 --> 15:14.133
AMAZED THAT AFTER THE FIFTH

15:14.200 --> 15:14.767
TIME, ANGELA MERKEL DIDN'T TURN

15:14.834 --> 15:15.300
TO THE TRANSLATOR AND SAY

15:15.367 --> 15:16.200
"OKAY, YOU'RE FIRED, YOU CAN'T

15:16.266 --> 15:16.800
POSSIBLY BE TRANSLATING THIS

15:16.867 --> 15:17.333
RIGHT."

15:17.400 --> 15:17.967
AND I'M NOT SAYING IT'S EASY TO

15:18.033 --> 15:18.433
UNDERSTAND TRADE.

15:18.500 --> 15:18.934
IT IS ONE OF THE MOST

15:19.000 --> 15:19.533
COMPLICATED ISSUES THERE IS --

15:19.600 --> 15:20.133
TECHNICALLY, POLITICALLY, AND

15:20.200 --> 15:21.200
EMOTIONALLY.

15:21.266 --> 15:22.367
OVER THE YEARS, FREE TRADE BEEN

15:22.433 --> 15:24.467
CRITICIZED FROM ALL SIDES.

15:24.533 --> 15:25.767
PEOPLE ARGUE THAT UNFETTERED

15:25.834 --> 15:27.800
TRADE CAN REWARD THE WORST

15:27.867 --> 15:30.667
BEHAVIOR OF MULTINATIONAL

15:30.734 --> 15:31.433
COMPANIES, AND EXPLOIT COUNTRIES

15:31.500 --> 15:32.000
WITH FEWER PROTECTIONS FOR

15:32.066 --> 15:33.600
LABOR, AND THAT HAS

15:33.667 --> 15:34.934
UNQUESTIONABLY HAPPENED.

15:35.033 --> 15:36.800
BUT TRUMP GENERALLY CONFINES

15:36.867 --> 15:47.867
HIMSELF TO ARGUING THAT TRADE IS

15:47.934 --> 15:48.600
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATH OF

15:48.667 --> 15:49.133
U.S. MANUFACTURING JOBS.

15:49.200 --> 15:50.133
AND WHILE THERE IS SOME TRUTH IN

15:50.200 --> 15:50.700
THAT, AUTOMATION IS THE FAR

15:50.767 --> 15:51.133
BIGGER CULPRIT.

15:51.200 --> 15:51.800
WE ACTUALLY STILL MAKE A LOT OF

15:51.867 --> 15:53.333
THINGS IN

15:53.400 --> 15:54.400
AMERICA.

15:54.467 --> 15:55.000
U.S. FACTORIES NOW MANUFACTURE

15:55.066 --> 15:55.700
TWICE AS MUCH AS THEY DID IN

15:55.767 --> 15:56.066
1984.

15:56.133 --> 15:56.667
BUT THEY DO IT WITH ONE-THIRD

15:56.734 --> 15:57.333
FEWER WORKERS.

15:57.400 --> 15:58.033
AND THE OVERWHELMING CONSENSUS

15:58.100 --> 15:58.834
AMONG ECONOMISTS IS THAT TRADE

15:58.900 --> 16:00.066
BETWEEN COUNTRIES, GENERALLY

16:00.133 --> 16:01.333
SPEAKING, CAN CREATE JOBS, LOWER

16:01.400 --> 16:03.266
COSTS, AND BE A NET BENEFIT TO

16:03.333 --> 16:05.166
BOTH NATIONS.

16:05.233 --> 16:10.066
ESSENTIALLY, THINK OF TRADE LIKE

16:10.133 --> 16:10.633
SEX.

16:10.700 --> 16:11.367
IF YOU'RE DOING IT RIGHT, IT CAN

16:11.433 --> 16:11.900
BE GOOD FOR BOTH PARTNERS,

16:11.967 --> 16:12.567
THOUGH THE ODDS OF THAT

16:12.633 --> 16:13.166
HAPPENING PLUMMET AS SOON AS

16:13.233 --> 16:15.300
DONALD TRUMP GETS INVOLVED.

16:15.367 --> 16:18.100
AND THE PROBLEM WITH TRUMP NOT

16:18.166 --> 16:19.166
UNDERSTANDING TRADE IS THAT HE

16:19.233 --> 16:19.734
DOESN'T UNDERSTAND ITS

16:19.800 --> 16:21.233
CONSEQUENCES.

16:21.300 --> 16:23.834
FOR INSTANCE, ONE OF THE FIRST

16:23.900 --> 16:26.100
MAJOR SHOTS HE FIRED IN THIS

16:26.166 --> 16:26.767
TRADE WAR WAS PUTTING TARIFFS ON

16:26.834 --> 16:27.333
STEEL AND ALUMINUM.

16:27.400 --> 16:30.633
THAT WAS GREAT NEWS FOR THE

16:30.700 --> 16:31.467
PEOPLE WORKING IN THOSE SPECIFIC

16:31.533 --> 16:32.400
INDUSTRIES, LIKE THIS WORKER

16:32.467 --> 16:34.333
IN A MISSOURI ALUMINUM PLANT.

16:34.400 --> 16:36.200
>> YOU -- YOU THINK THAT HIS

16:36.266 --> 16:36.834
POLICIES ARE KINDA WHY YOU HAVE

16:36.900 --> 16:39.133
A JOB TODAY?

16:39.200 --> 16:41.767
>> I KNOW IT IS.

16:41.834 --> 16:44.233
>> YOU KNOW IT IS?

16:44.300 --> 16:45.233
>> YEAH, I WOULDN'T OF HAD THIS

16:45.300 --> 16:45.900
JOB IF I- IF I DIDN'T HAPPEN.

16:45.967 --> 16:46.500
WISH I COULD MEET HIM.

16:46.567 --> 16:47.800
I'D GIVE HIM A BIG OLD HUG.

16:47.867 --> 16:49.200
YOU KNOW?

16:49.266 --> 16:51.000
>> John: I DO KNOW.

16:51.066 --> 16:51.633
AND I HONESTLY GET WHY HE WANTS

16:51.700 --> 16:52.600
TO HUG HIM.

16:52.667 --> 16:54.266
TRUMP GOT HIM HIS JOB BACK.

16:54.333 --> 16:55.533
IT'S ONE OF TWO POSSIBLE

16:55.600 --> 16:56.166
EXPLANATIONS FOR THAT MAN

16:56.233 --> 16:58.300
WANTING TO HUG DONALD TRUMP.

16:58.367 --> 16:59.600
THE OTHER, OF COURSE, BEING,

16:59.667 --> 17:01.667
THAT IF, DURING THE EARLY STAGES

17:01.734 --> 17:03.467
OF THE CAMPAIGN, TRUMP AND

17:03.533 --> 17:04.300
MELANIA WERE IN CAR, SEEN

17:04.367 --> 17:04.934
THROUGH RAIN-COVERED

17:05.000 --> 17:05.734
WINDSHIELD, DRIVING THROUGH

17:05.800 --> 17:06.500
MISSOURI ON A STORMY NIGHT

17:06.567 --> 17:07.100
AND THEIR CAR BROKE DOWN.

17:07.166 --> 17:07.667
DONALD'S NOT GETTING OUT, SO

17:07.734 --> 17:08.467
MELANIA ENDS UP CLIMBING OUT

17:08.533 --> 17:09.166
INTO THE RAIN AND OPENING THE

17:09.233 --> 17:09.734
HOOD AS THAT ALUMINUM WORKER

17:09.800 --> 17:11.166
COMES DRIVING DOWN THE HIGHWAY.

17:11.233 --> 17:11.900
HE ROLLS DOWN HIS WINDOW AND

17:11.967 --> 17:13.333
ASKS IF HE CAN HELP, TO WHICH

17:13.400 --> 17:14.100
MELANIA GRATEFULLY ASKS,

17:14.166 --> 17:15.600
"MAYBE A FLASHLIGHT?"

17:15.667 --> 17:17.066
AND JUST AS THE ALUMINUM WORKER

17:17.133 --> 17:18.100
IS HANDING THE FLASHLIGHT OVER,

17:18.166 --> 17:19.467
IT GETS STRUCK BY LIGHTNING AND

17:19.533 --> 17:20.633
THEY SWITCH BODIES.

17:20.700 --> 17:23.100
SO NOW DONALD IS LIVING IN THE

17:23.166 --> 17:24.600
WHITE HOUSE WITH AN ALUMINUM

17:24.667 --> 17:25.867
WORKER WHO FEELS UNDERSTANDABLY

17:25.934 --> 17:27.166
WEIRD ABOUT HOLDING HIS HAND,

17:27.233 --> 17:28.734
WHILE MELANIA IS FORCED TO PINE

17:28.800 --> 17:29.767
AFTER HER HUSBAND FROM THE

17:29.834 --> 17:31.533
FACTORY FLOOR, HER HEART ACHING

17:31.600 --> 17:32.300
FOR HIM EVERY SECOND OF EVERY

17:32.367 --> 17:34.066
DAY, KNOWING FULL WELL THAT

17:34.133 --> 17:35.266
REVEALING HER TRUE IDENTITY

17:35.333 --> 17:35.934
WOULD JUST COMPLICATE THINGS FOR

17:36.000 --> 17:36.867
EVERYONE.

17:36.934 --> 17:38.033
BUT THAT'S BULLSHIT, MELANIA!

17:38.100 --> 17:39.500
YOU GO TO HIM!

17:39.567 --> 17:41.567
THE WORLD WILL ACCEPT YOUR LOVE!

17:41.633 --> 17:42.433
THAT ALUMINUM WORKER CLEARLY

17:42.500 --> 17:43.567
ISN'T IN LOVE WITH HIM!

17:43.633 --> 17:45.166
EVERYONE CAN SEE IT!

17:45.233 --> 17:53.433
IT EXPLAINS SO MUCH!

17:54.867 --> 17:55.300
THE POINT IS, FOR THAT

17:55.367 --> 17:55.834
INDIVIDUAL GUY, IN THAT

17:55.900 --> 17:56.400
INDIVIDUAL JOB, THINGS HAVE

17:56.467 --> 17:56.934
IMPROVED.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.400
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO TRADE,

17:58.467 --> 18:00.500
NOTHING HAPPENS IN ISOLATION.

18:00.567 --> 18:01.633
AND THERE ARE DOWNSTREAM EFFECTS

18:01.700 --> 18:02.934
TO THOSE TARIFFS.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.367
NOT TOO FAR FROM WHERE HE WORKS,

18:04.433 --> 18:05.567
THERE'S A NAIL FACTORY WHICH

18:05.633 --> 18:07.567
SUFFERED.

18:07.633 --> 18:08.500
BECAUSE, THANKS TO TRUMP'S STEEL

18:08.567 --> 18:10.800
TARIFFS, THE PRICE OF THEIR RAW

18:10.867 --> 18:12.500
MATERIAL SKYROCKETED.

18:12.567 --> 18:14.734
SALES DROPPED IN HALF, AND

18:14.800 --> 18:15.700
THEY'VE LAID OFF OVER 100

18:15.767 --> 18:16.300
WORKERS, AND THOSE WHO REMAIN

18:16.367 --> 18:20.166
ARE WORRIED.

18:20.233 --> 18:20.934
>> SOME OF THESE PEOPLE, THIS IS

18:21.000 --> 18:21.834
THE ONLY INCOME THEY GOT.

18:21.900 --> 18:23.166
JUST LIKE ME.

18:23.233 --> 18:24.233
THIS IS THE ONLY INCOME I GOT.

18:24.300 --> 18:24.867
AND I GOTTA PUT ANOTHER DAUGHTER

18:24.934 --> 18:27.834
THROUGH SCHOOL.

18:27.900 --> 18:31.200
YOU KNOW, IT'S GONNA BE HARD.

18:31.266 --> 18:31.734
>> John: YEAH, IT IS.

18:31.800 --> 18:32.633
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

18:32.700 --> 18:33.300
PROTECTING STEEL HELPS STEEL,

18:33.367 --> 18:34.266
BUT IT HURTS ANYTHING MADE FROM

18:34.333 --> 18:35.133
IT.

18:35.200 --> 18:35.734
AND YOU HAVE TO BALANCE THOSE

18:35.800 --> 18:37.567
CONSEQUENCES.

18:37.633 --> 18:40.033
BY ONE ESTIMATE, TRUMP'S TARIFFS

18:40.100 --> 18:41.533
MAY CREATE 26,000 JOBS IN STEEL

18:41.600 --> 18:43.900
AND ALUMINUM, BUT COULD COST

18:43.967 --> 18:45.467
OVER 400,000 JOBS ACROSS THE

18:45.533 --> 18:47.166
REST OF THE ECONOMY.

18:47.233 --> 18:49.200
SO IF TRUMP'S TRYING TO CREATE

18:49.266 --> 18:50.867
JOBS, ALMOST ANYTHING WOULD BE A

18:50.934 --> 18:53.667
BETTER IDEA THAN TARIFFS.

18:53.734 --> 18:54.767
HE'D BE BETTER OFF DRESSING A

18:54.834 --> 18:55.867
TURTLE UP LIKE DAVID BOWIE AND

18:55.934 --> 18:56.667
THROWING HIM INTO A POOL FULL OF

18:56.734 --> 18:57.667
MILK.

18:57.734 --> 18:58.767
WILL THAT CREATE JOBS?

18:58.834 --> 18:59.600
NO.

18:59.667 --> 19:01.367
BUT IT WON'T ACTIVELY LOSE

19:01.433 --> 19:02.667
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF THEM,

19:02.734 --> 19:04.300
PLUS IT'D BE THE HIGHLIGHT

19:04.367 --> 19:08.200
OF ZIGGY SHELLDUST'S LIFE.

19:08.266 --> 19:09.900
AND WE'RE ONLY SCRATCHING THE

19:09.967 --> 19:10.633
SURFACE OF HOW COMPLICATED THIS

19:10.700 --> 19:12.033
IS.

19:12.100 --> 19:13.266
BECAUSE DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN A

19:13.333 --> 19:15.100
FOREIGN PRODUCT AND AN AMERICAN

19:15.166 --> 19:16.400
JOB CAN BE TRICKIER THAN YOU'D

19:16.467 --> 19:20.867
THINK.

19:20.934 --> 19:21.467
TAKE SOME OF TRUMP'S FAVORITE

19:21.533 --> 19:22.834
VILLAINS WHEN IT COMES TO

19:22.900 --> 19:23.233
FOREIGN COMPANIES.

19:23.300 --> 19:24.266
>> THEY SELL MERCEDES AND

19:24.333 --> 19:25.467
BMW AND THE CARS COME IN BY THE

19:25.533 --> 19:27.400
MILLIONS.

19:27.467 --> 19:31.233
AND WE HARDLY TAX THEM AT ALL.

19:31.300 --> 19:31.867
WE CAN'T DO THIS STUFF ANYMORE.

19:31.934 --> 19:32.400
WE PROTECT GERMANY.

19:32.467 --> 19:32.967
GERMANY, WHO DOESN'T HAVE A

19:33.033 --> 19:34.934
BMW?

19:35.000 --> 19:36.800
WE'RE GONNA TAX MERCEDES-BENZ,

19:36.867 --> 19:38.834
WE'RE GONNA TAX BMW.

19:38.900 --> 19:40.400
WE'RE GONNA TAX ALL OF THOSE

19:40.467 --> 19:41.867
BEAUTIFUL MERCEDES BENZES THAT

19:41.934 --> 19:46.533
ARE COMING IN, AND WE'RE GONNA

19:46.600 --> 19:47.500
TAX BMWS THAT ARE COMING IN.

19:47.567 --> 19:48.133
>> John: YEAH, TRUMP IS FURIOUS

19:48.200 --> 19:49.700
WITH GERMAN CARS.

19:49.767 --> 19:50.934
HERE'S THE THING ABOUT THAT.

19:51.000 --> 19:51.934
IN THE CLIP WHERE HE SAID, "WHO

19:52.000 --> 19:53.166
DOESN'T HAVE A BMW?"

19:53.233 --> 19:54.300
TO THE CROWD, IN HIS CLASSIC

19:54.367 --> 19:57.200
MAN-OF-THE PEOPLE WAY, TRUMP IS

19:57.266 --> 19:58.667
IN NORTH AUGUSTA, SOUTH

19:58.734 --> 20:00.800
CAROLINA, AND JUST TWO

20:00.867 --> 20:02.266
HOURS AWAY IS A PLACE CALLED

20:02.333 --> 20:04.500
SPARTANBURG COUNTY, WELL-KNOWN

20:04.567 --> 20:05.934
FOR THIS.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.300
>> SPARTANBURG IS HOME TO THE

20:07.367 --> 20:08.967
LARGEST BMW PLANT IN THE WORLD.

20:09.033 --> 20:10.700
LAST YEAR THEY MADE MORE THAN

20:10.767 --> 20:12.400
THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND

20:12.467 --> 20:14.300
LUXURY SUV'S, EMPLOYING TEN

20:14.367 --> 20:16.700
THOUSAND PEOPLE, PUMPING

20:16.767 --> 20:17.533
BILLIONS INTO THE STATE'S

20:17.600 --> 20:18.166
ECONOMY.

20:18.233 --> 20:18.800
YES.

20:18.867 --> 20:19.433
IT SEEMS TRUMP DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

20:19.500 --> 20:20.800
AND LOOK.

20:20.867 --> 20:21.467
EVERYONE KNOWS HE DOESN'T KNOW A

20:21.533 --> 20:23.467
LOT OF THINGS.

20:23.533 --> 20:24.100
BUT OCCASIONALLY IT'S IMPORTANT

20:24.166 --> 20:25.500
TO REMEMBER THAT HE ALSO DOESN'T

20:25.567 --> 20:26.667
KNOW ANYTHING.

20:26.734 --> 20:29.700
IT'S TRUE.

20:29.767 --> 20:31.533
EVERYONE CLOSE YOUR EYES AND

20:31.600 --> 20:33.300
THINK OF SOMETHING.

20:33.367 --> 20:35.033
THAT THING YOU'RE THINKING OF?

20:35.100 --> 20:37.133
HE DOESN'T KNOW THAT.

20:37.200 --> 20:39.300
AND SINCE THE TRADE WAR BEGAN,

20:39.367 --> 20:41.233
SPARTANBURG COUNTY IS

20:41.300 --> 20:41.567
DOUBLE-FUCKED.

20:41.633 --> 20:42.200
BECAUSE THEY'LL BE AFFECTED BY

20:42.266 --> 20:43.500
HIGHER COSTS FOR THE STEEL THEY

20:43.567 --> 20:45.567
USE TO BUILD THE CARS, AND

20:45.633 --> 20:46.834
WHEN THEY TRY TO SHIP THEM TO

20:46.900 --> 20:47.500
CHINA, THEY'LL BE HIT BY CHINESE

20:47.567 --> 20:48.233
TARIFFS.

20:48.300 --> 20:50.367
SO THEY'RE IN TROUBLE.

20:50.433 --> 20:51.300
OR AS TRUMP MIGHT PUT IT,

20:51.367 --> 20:52.467
"LISTEN YOU MOTHERFUCKERS,

20:52.533 --> 20:54.900
YOU'RE GETTING TAXED TWICE."

20:54.967 --> 20:56.367
SO, IF A TRADE WAR COULD BE THIS

20:56.433 --> 20:58.033
DISRUPTIVE, AND THE NET

20:58.100 --> 20:59.400
BENEFITS ARE LIKELY TO BE

20:59.467 --> 21:00.433
NEGATIVE, WHY IS TRUMP DOING

21:00.500 --> 21:02.266
THIS?

21:02.333 --> 21:03.700
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE MEMBERS OF

21:03.767 --> 21:04.600
HIS OWN ECONOMIC TEAM SEEM

21:04.667 --> 21:05.567
AGAINST IT?

21:05.633 --> 21:10.800
GARY COHN REPORTEDLY LEFT OVER

21:10.867 --> 21:11.333
THE PROPOSED TARIFFS AND

21:11.400 --> 21:12.300
TREASURY SECRETARY AND

21:12.367 --> 21:13.967
WHITE-HOT SEX BOMB -- HAS TRIED

21:14.033 --> 21:17.800
TO DO DAMAGE CONTROL BY CLAIMING

21:17.867 --> 21:18.400
WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY IN A TRADE

21:18.467 --> 21:19.367
WAR AT ALL.

21:19.433 --> 21:19.867
>> THIS HAS BEEN A TRADE

21:19.934 --> 21:21.533
DISPUTE ALL ALONG.

21:21.600 --> 21:24.200
IT NEVER WAS A TRADE WAR.

21:24.266 --> 21:24.667
IT'S A TRADE DISPUTE.

21:24.734 --> 21:25.800
>> OH!

21:25.867 --> 21:26.367
IT'S NOT A WAR -- IT'S A

21:26.433 --> 21:28.000
DISPUTE!

21:28.066 --> 21:30.367
I ALMOST BOUGHT THAT BULLSHIT,

21:30.433 --> 21:30.967
BECAUSE I WAS SO DISTRACTED BY

21:31.033 --> 21:31.834
THIS LAVA-RICH SEX VOLCANO'S

21:31.900 --> 21:33.467
LOOKS.

21:33.533 --> 21:34.633
HE'S HYPNOTIC.

21:34.700 --> 21:35.734
I MUST HAVE A BAD CASE OF THE

21:35.800 --> 21:36.867
MNUCHIES RIGHT NOW, BECAUSE HE

21:36.934 --> 21:37.700
IS LOOKING LIKE AN ABSOLUTE

21:37.767 --> 21:40.800
"SNACK."

21:40.867 --> 21:43.266
SO WHO IS TELLING THE PRESIDENT

21:43.333 --> 21:45.500
THIS IS A GOOD IDEA?

21:45.567 --> 21:48.500
WELL, BY MOST ACCOUNTS, THE

21:48.567 --> 21:49.567
DRIVING FORCE IS PETER NAVARRO

21:49.633 --> 21:50.567
-- HEAD OF THE OFFICE OF TRADE

21:50.633 --> 21:51.800
AND MANUFACTURING POLICY.

21:51.867 --> 21:54.000
HE'S TRUMP'S TRADE GUY.

21:54.066 --> 22:00.567
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, PETER?

22:00.633 --> 22:03.867
>> I'M THE TRADE GUY.

22:03.934 --> 22:04.700
>> John: THANKS, PETE.

22:04.767 --> 22:05.400
SO, FOR THE RECORD, LET'S ALL

22:05.467 --> 22:06.367
GET OUR TRUMP

22:06.433 --> 22:06.967
ADMINISTRATION ROLES STRAIGHT:

22:07.033 --> 22:07.700
WE'VE GOT TRADE GUY,

22:07.767 --> 22:08.400
LIAR LADY, NOTHING BOY, JESUS

22:08.467 --> 22:09.033
PLEASER, WORD GHOUL, CRIME

22:09.100 --> 22:09.767
NYMPH, DRUNK GRANDPA, AND

22:09.834 --> 22:10.533
DAUGHTER WIFE.

22:10.600 --> 22:13.100
IT'S A WELL-OILED MACHINE.

22:13.166 --> 22:15.133
NAVARRO IS THE AUTHOR OF A

22:15.200 --> 22:15.934
SERIES OF NAVARRO BOOKS,

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
GET-RICH INVESTMENT BOOKS, AND

22:17.066 --> 22:18.233
LIKE TRUMP, HE'S OBSESSED WITH

22:18.300 --> 22:19.600
TRADE DEFICITS IN GENERAL,

22:19.667 --> 22:21.133
AND CHINA IN PARTICULAR, SAYING

22:21.200 --> 22:23.133
TRADE WITH CHINA IS A

22:23.200 --> 22:24.467
"ZERO-SUM GAME," MEANING ONE

22:24.533 --> 22:25.667
COUNTRY CAN ONLY WIN IF THE

22:25.734 --> 22:27.633
OTHER COUNTRY LOSES.

22:27.700 --> 22:30.233
AND IT IS HARD TO OVERSTATE JUST

22:30.300 --> 22:30.800
HOW RARE HIS VIEWS ARE AMONG

22:30.867 --> 22:32.767
ECONOMISTS.

22:32.834 --> 22:33.600
WHEN THE NEW YORKER PROFILED

22:33.667 --> 22:34.533
HIM, THEY ASKED NAVARRO

22:34.600 --> 22:36.300
TO HELP THEM FIND EVEN ONE

22:36.367 --> 22:38.133
COLLEAGUE WHO AGREED WITH HIM.

22:38.200 --> 22:39.667
HE GAVE THEM TWO NAMES.

22:39.734 --> 22:40.900
ONE WAS PETER MORICI, A

22:40.967 --> 22:42.100
UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND

22:42.166 --> 22:43.467
PROFESSOR WHO SAID OF NAVARRO,

22:43.533 --> 22:44.166
HE "HAS A RATHER SEVERE

22:44.233 --> 22:45.367
POSITION.

22:45.433 --> 22:46.734
THAT ZEROSUM STATEMENT, I HAVE A

22:46.800 --> 22:48.600
PROBLEM WITH THAT.

22:48.667 --> 22:50.700
WHERE'S HIS PROOF?"

22:50.767 --> 22:52.100
AND THE OTHER WAS A BLOGGER

22:52.166 --> 22:54.333
NAMED ALAN TONELSON, WHO NAVARRO

22:54.400 --> 22:55.700
DESCRIBED AS "A FINE ECONOMIST,"

22:55.767 --> 22:57.066
TO WHICH TONELSON

22:57.133 --> 22:58.133
REPLIED, "I DO NOT HOLD AN

22:58.200 --> 23:00.800
ECONOMICS DEGREE."

23:00.867 --> 23:02.700
I'M GUESSING HE ALSO DOESN'T

23:02.767 --> 23:08.233
HOLD A DEGREE IN WEB DESIGN,

23:08.300 --> 23:09.166
BECAUSE THIS IS THE PHOTO ON THE

23:09.233 --> 23:09.967
"ABOUT" PAGE OF HIS BLOG.

23:10.033 --> 23:12.000
SO IF YOU'RE WONDERING AT THIS

23:12.066 --> 23:13.200
POINT, "THEN HOW ON EARTH DID

23:13.266 --> 23:14.166
NAVARRO GET A JOB AT THE

23:14.233 --> 23:16.734
WHITE HOUSE?"

23:16.800 --> 23:17.934
WELL, IT'S WAY DUMBER THAN

23:18.000 --> 23:19.667
YOU'RE THINKING.

23:19.734 --> 23:21.000
APPARENTLY, JARED KUSHNER WAS

23:21.066 --> 23:22.200
TASKED WITH FINDING TRUMP

23:22.266 --> 23:25.800
EXPERTS ON CHINESE TRADE, AND

23:25.867 --> 23:27.066
THIS IS HOW HE WENT ABOUT IT.

23:27.133 --> 23:28.100
>> SO JARED WENT ON AMAZON. HE

23:28.166 --> 23:29.667
FIRED UP HIS COMPUTER AND HE

23:29.734 --> 23:30.834
FOUND SOME OF PETER NAVARRO'S

23:30.900 --> 23:31.500
BOOKS AND HE ASKED HIM TO COME

23:31.567 --> 23:32.900
TO THE WHITE HOUSE.

23:32.967 --> 23:33.734
THAT'S HOW PETER NAVARRO

23:33.800 --> 23:37.233
ENDED UP IN THE WHITE HOUSE.

23:37.300 --> 23:38.633
>> John: YES, JARED LOOKED FOR

23:38.700 --> 23:42.233
EXPERTS ON AMAZON.

23:42.300 --> 23:43.600
THAT WAS HIS RIGOROUS PROCESS.

23:43.667 --> 23:44.734
SO WHEN JEFF SESSIONS GETS

23:44.800 --> 23:46.100
FIRED, BE PREPARED FOR HIM

23:46.166 --> 23:47.200
TO BE REPLACED BY CRYSTAL

23:47.266 --> 23:49.066
KASWELL, AUTHOR OF THE EROTIC

23:49.133 --> 23:50.567
FICTION NOVEL, "DANGEROUS ROCK:

23:50.633 --> 23:51.967
A DANGEROUS NOISE NOVEL."

23:52.033 --> 23:53.767
BECAUSE, FOR WHATEVER REASON,

23:53.834 --> 23:54.734
THAT'S HONESTLY THE FIRST THING

23:54.800 --> 23:56.967
THAT CAME UP WHEN WE TYPED

23:57.033 --> 23:57.567
"GOOD LAW PERSON, PARENTHESES

23:57.633 --> 23:59.600
'SMART'" INTO

23:59.667 --> 24:01.967
AMAZON.

24:02.033 --> 24:04.500
THE NAVARRO BOOK THAT JARED

24:04.567 --> 24:07.667
FOUND WAS "DEATH BY CHINA",

24:07.734 --> 24:08.533
WHICH PAINTS THE U.S.-

24:08.600 --> 24:09.133
CHINESE TRADE RELATIONSHIP IN

24:09.200 --> 24:10.266
APOCALYPTIC TERMS.

24:10.333 --> 24:11.333
BECAUSE WHILE THERE ARE SOME

24:11.400 --> 24:12.633
LEGITIMATE COMPLAINTS ABOUT

24:12.700 --> 24:14.133
CHINA'S UNFAIR PRACTICES --

24:14.200 --> 24:15.333
THEY'VE DELIBERATELY DEPRESSED

24:15.400 --> 24:16.867
THEIR CURRENCY, THEY VIOLATE

24:16.934 --> 24:19.200
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

24:19.266 --> 24:20.333
RIGHTS, AND ARGUABLY SKIRT WTO

24:20.400 --> 24:21.834
RULES, THIS BOOK GOES WAY

24:21.900 --> 24:23.533
FURTHER, WITH CHAPTER TITLES

24:23.600 --> 24:25.300
FEATURING PHRASES LIKE

24:25.367 --> 24:36.066
"SHANGHAIING THE GENE POOL."

24:36.133 --> 24:38.700
AND "LOOK MA, THERE'S A DEATH

24:38.767 --> 24:43.834
STAR POINTING AT CHICAGO."

24:43.900 --> 24:44.567
NAVARRO ACTUALLY TURNED THE BOOK

24:44.633 --> 24:45.166
INTO A MOVIE THAT ONE CRITIC

24:45.233 --> 24:45.934
CALLED

24:46.000 --> 24:46.533
"THE DOCUMENTARY EQUIVALENT OF

24:46.600 --> 24:47.033
A RAVING STREET-CORNER

24:47.100 --> 24:47.700
DERELICT."

24:47.767 --> 24:48.700
WHICH SEEMS HARSH, UNTIL YOU SEE

24:48.767 --> 24:49.233
HOW THE MOVIE BEGINS.

24:49.300 --> 24:50.033
>> THE FILM YOU'RE ABOUT TO SEE

24:50.100 --> 24:50.667
ADDRESSES ONE OF THE MOST URGENT

24:50.734 --> 24:51.266
PROBLEMS FACING AMERICA: IT'S

24:51.333 --> 24:51.967
INCREASINGLY DESTRUCTIVE TRADE

24:52.033 --> 24:53.100
RELATIONSHIP WITH A RAPIDLY

24:53.166 --> 25:00.033
RISING CHINA.

25:00.100 --> 25:03.633
>> John: IT STARTS LIKE THAT.

25:03.700 --> 25:04.333
ITS WARMUP IS A LITERAL KNIFE

25:04.400 --> 25:05.033
BEING STABBED

25:05.100 --> 25:05.867
INTO THE HEART OF AMERICA.

25:05.934 --> 25:06.600
AND IF YOU'RE WORRIED THAT

25:06.667 --> 25:07.266
LEAVES IT WITH

25:07.333 --> 25:07.900
NOWHERE TO GO, DON'T BE.

25:07.967 --> 25:08.533
BECAUSE THERE ARE EVEN

25:08.600 --> 25:09.200
LESS-SUBTLE ANIMATIONS TO COME,

25:09.266 --> 25:10.467
WHICH DEPICT CHINA'S TRADE

25:10.533 --> 25:11.200
PRACTICES AS GUNS AND BOMBS THAT

25:11.266 --> 25:12.300
BLOW UP AMERICAN FACTORIES, AND

25:12.367 --> 25:13.500
STUNNINGLY DECEPTIVE MOMENTS

25:13.567 --> 25:15.200
LIKE THIS.

25:15.266 --> 25:16.934
>> CHINA HAS STOLEN THOUSANDS OF

25:17.000 --> 25:18.233
OUR FACTORIES AND MILLIONS OF

25:18.300 --> 25:19.800
OUR JOBS.

25:19.867 --> 25:21.266
MULTINATIONAL CORPORATION

25:21.333 --> 25:23.533
PROFITS ARE SOARING AND WE NOW

25:23.600 --> 25:25.867
OWE OVER THREE TRILLION DOLLARS

25:25.934 --> 25:27.333
TO THE WORLD'S LARGEST COMMUNIST

25:27.400 --> 25:29.200
NATION.

25:29.266 --> 25:30.767
>> John: AND LOOK.

25:30.834 --> 25:31.967
THAT LARGE BALL IS VERY

25:32.033 --> 25:34.600
CONVINCING, BUT OUR TRADE

25:34.667 --> 25:36.467
DEFICIT ISN'T THE SAME AS "WHAT

25:36.533 --> 25:38.934
WE OWE TO CHINA" -- THOSE ARE

25:39.000 --> 25:39.400
TWO DIFFERENT NUMBERS.

25:39.467 --> 25:40.533
AND NEITHER OF THEM IS ANYWHERE

25:40.600 --> 25:42.100
CLOSE TO 3 TRILLION.

25:42.166 --> 25:43.567
AND WHEN SOMETHING THAT CENTRAL

25:43.633 --> 25:45.934
TO YOUR MOVIE HAS SOMETHING THAT

25:46.000 --> 25:49.133
WRONG WITH IT, YOU USUALLY HAVE

25:49.200 --> 25:49.734
TO REPLACE IT WITH CHRISTOPHER

25:49.800 --> 25:52.967
PLUMMER.

25:53.033 --> 25:54.066
SO NAVARRO IS NOT SOMEONE WHO

25:54.133 --> 25:54.667
ANY LEGITIMATE ECONOMIST TAKES

25:54.734 --> 25:56.333
SERIOUSLY.

25:56.400 --> 25:57.166
AND YET, HE SEEMS TO BE THE ONLY

25:57.233 --> 25:57.667
PERSON THE PRESIDENT IS

25:57.734 --> 25:59.700
LISTENING TO.

25:59.767 --> 26:01.233
TRUMP HAS CALLED "DEATH BY

26:01.300 --> 26:02.533
CHINA"

26:02.600 --> 26:08.333
"RIGHT ON."

26:08.400 --> 26:09.066
AND LAUDED IT'S FACTS, FIGURES,

26:09.133 --> 26:09.567
AND INSIGHT.

26:09.633 --> 26:10.300
AND NAVARRO RETURNS THE

26:10.367 --> 26:11.100
COMPLIMENT, SAYING OF HIS OWN

26:11.166 --> 26:11.734
JOB, THAT "MY FUNCTION, REALLY,

26:11.800 --> 26:12.567
AS AN ECONOMIST IS TO TRY TO

26:12.633 --> 26:13.200
PROVIDE THE UNDERLYING ANALYTICS

26:13.266 --> 26:14.934
THAT CONFIRM TRUMP'S INTUITION."

26:15.000 --> 26:15.500
AND HIS INTUITION IS ALWAYS

26:15.567 --> 26:17.767
RIGHT."

26:17.834 --> 26:19.333
AND THAT'S TERRIFYING.

26:19.400 --> 26:21.066
BECAUSE AN ECONOMIST SHOULDN'T

26:21.133 --> 26:22.133
BE FINDING WAYS TO CONFIRM THE

26:22.200 --> 26:23.266
INTUITIONS OF SOMEONE WHO

26:23.333 --> 26:24.367
DOESN'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE

26:24.433 --> 26:25.767
TALKING ABOUT.

26:25.834 --> 26:27.066
IT'S LIKE A BUILDER WORKING FOR

26:27.133 --> 26:28.600
A CHILD, SAYING, "MY JOB IS

26:28.667 --> 26:30.266
TO BUILD THIS HOUSE HE DESIGNED,

26:30.333 --> 26:31.367
WHICH IS SHAPED LIKE AN

26:31.433 --> 26:32.700
ICE-CREAM CONE, WITH A WINDOW

26:32.767 --> 26:34.266
THAT IS ALSO A DOOR, AND THE

26:34.333 --> 26:36.033
SIZE OF THE SUN, AND A DOG.

26:36.100 --> 26:37.600
HIS INTUITION'S ALWAYS RIGHT."

26:37.667 --> 26:38.934
NO IT ISN'T!

26:39.000 --> 26:40.033
YOU NEED TO STOP THAT CHILD

26:40.100 --> 26:43.633
BEFORE SOMEONE GETS HURT.

26:43.700 --> 26:45.500
IN FACT, IF YOU WANT TO GET A

26:45.567 --> 26:48.266
SENSE OF JUST HOW LITTLE NAVARRO

26:48.333 --> 26:49.834
UNDERSTANDS THE GAME HE'S

26:49.900 --> 26:50.333
PLAYING, CONSIDER THIS.

26:50.400 --> 26:52.166
SINCE THE TRADE WAR BEGAN, CHINA

26:52.233 --> 26:58.433
HAS IMPOSED $37 BILLION OF

26:58.500 --> 26:59.300
TARIFFS ON THE U.S.

26:59.367 --> 27:00.233
NOW, TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT HE SAID

27:00.300 --> 27:00.700
BACK IN MARCH.

27:00.767 --> 27:01.433
>> ARE YOU EXPECTING CHINA

27:01.500 --> 27:02.333
TO COME BACK WITH RETALIATION?

27:02.400 --> 27:02.834
>> I DON'T BELIEVE ANY

27:02.900 --> 27:04.000
COUNTRY IN THE WORLD IS GOING TO

27:04.066 --> 27:06.033
RETALIATE FOR THE SIMPLE REASON

27:06.100 --> 27:07.066
THAT WE ARE THE MOST LUCRATIVE

27:07.133 --> 27:08.500
AND BIGGEST MARKET IN THE WORLD.

27:08.567 --> 27:10.533
THEY KNOW THEY'RE CHEATING US

27:10.600 --> 27:11.700
AND ALL WE'RE DOING IS STANDING

27:11.767 --> 27:17.333
UP FOR OURSELVES.

27:17.400 --> 27:18.200
>> John: IT'S BREATHTAKING TO

27:18.266 --> 27:18.800
SEE SOMEONE BE THAT CONFIDENT

27:18.867 --> 27:19.433
AND THAT WRONG.

27:19.500 --> 27:19.967
HE WAS BASICALLY LEONARDO

27:20.033 --> 27:20.600
DICAPRIO IN "TITANIC" YELLING

27:20.667 --> 27:21.233
"I'M THE KING OF THE WORLD."

27:21.300 --> 27:22.533
YOU'RE NOT, LEO.

27:22.600 --> 27:23.600
YOU'RE JUST AN AMATEUR SKETCH

27:23.667 --> 27:24.700
ARTIST WHO'S ABOUT TO BE

27:24.767 --> 27:26.633
MURDERED BY ICE.

27:26.700 --> 27:28.900
WHEN YOU PUT ALL THIS TOGETHER,

27:28.967 --> 27:30.166
WHAT YOU'RE LEFT WITH IS THIS:

27:30.233 --> 27:31.266
WE'RE ENGAGED IN AN ESCALATING

27:31.333 --> 27:32.800
TRADE WAR THAT ALMOST NO

27:32.867 --> 27:34.567
LEGITIMATE ECONOMIST SUPPORTS,

27:34.633 --> 27:35.700
LED BY A MAN WHO HONESTLY

27:35.767 --> 27:36.567
DOESN'T SEEM TO FULLY

27:36.633 --> 27:38.266
UNDERSTAND THE MECHANICS OF WHAT

27:38.333 --> 27:39.166
HE'S DOING, GETTING ADVICE FROM

27:39.233 --> 27:40.266
THE HUMAN EQUIVALENT OF AN

27:40.333 --> 27:43.100
ALL-CAPS EMAIL FROM YOUR UNCLE.

27:43.166 --> 27:44.066
THE CRAZY THING IS, THE EFFECT

27:44.133 --> 27:45.700
OF THIS IS THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT

27:45.767 --> 27:47.433
TRUMP SAYS HE WANTS.

27:47.500 --> 27:49.100
BECAUSE IF YOU WANT TO CREATE

27:49.166 --> 27:50.100
JOBS, YOU DON'T DO THAT BY

27:50.166 --> 27:51.333
CUTTING OFF AMERICAN COMPANIES'

27:51.400 --> 27:53.533
MARKETS AND SUPPLIERS.

27:53.600 --> 27:55.066
AND IF YOU WANT TO CURB THE

27:55.133 --> 27:55.700
ABUSES OF COUNTRIES LIKE CHINA,

27:55.767 --> 27:56.667
YOU DON'T DO THAT BY PISSING OFF

27:56.734 --> 27:57.300
THE LEADERS OF EVERY OTHER

27:57.367 --> 27:58.900
NATION ON EARTH.

27:58.967 --> 27:59.900
AND I KNOW NONE OF WHAT I'M

27:59.967 --> 28:01.000
SAYING WILL GET THROUGH TO

28:01.066 --> 28:02.100
TRUMP.

28:02.166 --> 28:03.266
SO MAYBE IT'S TIME TO TAKE A

28:03.333 --> 28:05.500
PAGE FROM THE ONE PERSON HE

28:05.567 --> 28:07.233
LISTENS TO, AND GIVE HIM SOME

28:07.300 --> 28:08.667
BASIC ECONOMIC LESSONS IN THE

28:08.734 --> 28:10.200
ONLY LANGUAGE HE UNDERSTANDS.

28:10.266 --> 28:17.200
HELLO THERE, I'M JOHN OLIVER AND

28:17.266 --> 28:20.533
>> THE FILM YOU ARE ABOUT TO SEE

28:20.600 --> 28:23.834
ADDRESSES ONE OF THE --

28:23.900 --> 28:24.667
STUPIDITY.

28:24.734 --> 28:26.233
AND OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF IT

28:26.300 --> 28:27.633
COULD BE DISASTROUS.

28:27.700 --> 28:28.100
SO LET'S REVIEW A FEW

28:28.166 --> 28:31.033
FUNDAMENTAL FACTS.

28:31.100 --> 28:32.033
FIRST, A TRADE DEFICIT ISN'T A

28:32.100 --> 28:33.433
GIANT POOL OF MONEY THAT YOU

28:33.500 --> 28:35.834
HAVE LOST IT TO ANOTHER COUNTRY.

28:35.900 --> 28:36.433
THAT'S IDIOTIC.

28:36.500 --> 28:38.233
AND IF YOU THINK YOU CAN USE

28:38.300 --> 28:39.600
TARIFFS AS A WEAPON, YOU SHOULD

28:39.667 --> 28:42.000
UNDERSTAND A TARIFF ISN'T

28:42.066 --> 28:42.633
SOMETHING OTHER COUNTRIES PLAY

28:42.700 --> 28:43.033
YOU.

28:43.100 --> 28:44.600
IT IS A TAX YOU ARE FORCING YOUR

28:44.667 --> 28:47.233
OTHER PEOPLE TO PAY, WHICH MIGHT

28:47.300 --> 28:47.900
END UP HURTING THEM A LOT LESS

28:47.967 --> 28:50.700
THAN IT HURTS YOU.

28:50.767 --> 28:53.800
AND THIRD, OUR ECONOMY IS

28:53.867 --> 28:54.867
MASSIVELY INTERCONNECTED, AND

28:54.934 --> 28:57.600
YOU CAN'T JUST TAMPER WITH ONE

28:57.667 --> 28:59.133
THING WITHOUT CONSIDERING WHAT

28:59.200 --> 29:01.367
THE WIDER CONSEQUENCES COULD BE.

29:01.433 --> 29:04.200
UNFORTUNATELY, BASIC KNOWLEDGE

29:04.266 --> 29:04.533
IS SHRINKING.

29:04.600 --> 29:09.333
AND THE RESULT IS STUPIDITY IS

29:09.400 --> 29:11.667
INCREASING AT AN UNSUSTAINABLE

29:11.734 --> 29:13.000
RATE.

29:13.066 --> 29:13.633
ECONOMICS IS EXTREMELY

29:13.700 --> 29:15.533
COMPLICATED, AND AT THE VERY

29:15.600 --> 29:17.967
LEAST, YOU SHOULD NOT FIND YOUR

29:18.033 --> 29:22.934
KEY ADVISOR ON FUCKING AMAZON

29:23.000 --> 29:26.066
BECAUSE HIS A BULLSHIT COULD END

29:26.133 --> 29:29.800
UP SERIOUSLY HURTING US ALL.

29:31.266 --> 29:32.667
>> John: WE ARE ALL FOR THE

29:32.734 --> 29:33.834
NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS.

29:33.900 --> 29:34.900
SEE YOU THEN.
