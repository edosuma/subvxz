00:08.133 --> 00:09.634
Previously
on "The Lost Symbol..."

00:09.676 --> 00:13.722
Cascade is a long-range acoustic
antipersonnel technology.

00:13.763 --> 00:15.724
KATHERINE:
He was writing about it
in his journals.

00:15.765 --> 00:17.642
-Sound
can create patterns and...
-And symbols.

00:17.684 --> 00:20.729
This is the frequency
of creation.

00:20.770 --> 00:22.522
Where is it? This portal
that I've heard about.

00:22.564 --> 00:25.066
It's not here. They played you.

00:25.108 --> 00:27.235
This tells us
the final location.

00:27.277 --> 00:28.528
The Washington Monument.

00:28.570 --> 00:29.904
I'm going to have
to detain you, sir.

00:29.946 --> 00:31.823
(gasps)

00:35.035 --> 00:36.870
Hey, sis.

00:38.329 --> 00:40.582
* *

00:50.633 --> 00:53.470
(gasping)

01:01.478 --> 01:03.605
(breathing shakily)

01:09.194 --> 01:11.321
Oh, God.

01:11.363 --> 01:15.241
Help! Help!

01:16.242 --> 01:18.495
-God.
-MAN: Keep going.

01:22.582 --> 01:24.042
Hello?

01:24.084 --> 01:26.378
MAN:
Keep going.

01:27.170 --> 01:28.505
I can't see.

01:28.546 --> 01:31.383
MAN:
Open your eyes.

01:33.718 --> 01:35.136
(exhales)

01:35.178 --> 01:37.430
(groans)

01:47.649 --> 01:49.275
Oh, God.

01:53.321 --> 01:55.407
Katherine!

02:01.162 --> 02:03.373
* *

02:18.596 --> 02:23.184
BLAKE: So, thanks to
a very helpful security guard,

02:23.226 --> 02:25.645
we're together again.

02:27.230 --> 02:30.191
You know, you really should
have honored our agreement.

02:30.984 --> 02:34.404
And you really should
have honored ours.

02:35.155 --> 02:38.241
Got to hand it to you.

02:38.283 --> 02:41.202
You guys are smart.

02:41.244 --> 02:44.664
You, your daughter, Langdon.

02:44.706 --> 02:47.292
The three of you
working together

02:47.334 --> 02:49.294
to find the portal.

02:49.336 --> 02:51.921
Impressive team.

02:52.756 --> 02:55.592
So, did you figure it out?

02:56.426 --> 02:58.386
Ask your questions.

02:58.428 --> 03:00.847
You'll get nothing from me.

03:00.889 --> 03:02.932
I know.

03:04.142 --> 03:07.270
So why don't we let him
take a run at you?

03:23.787 --> 03:25.789
* *

03:32.128 --> 03:34.339
-KATHERINE:
I'm not going in there.
-ZACH: Keep moving.

03:34.381 --> 03:35.757
No.

03:37.967 --> 03:40.637
It's me, Zach.

03:42.097 --> 03:44.057
It's Katherine.

03:44.099 --> 03:46.643
Special K.

03:49.396 --> 03:50.605
Zach, it's me.

03:50.647 --> 03:53.483
(screams, panting)

03:55.151 --> 03:57.404
You won't do it.

03:57.445 --> 04:00.448
You tell that to your father.

04:02.492 --> 04:04.661
And your mother.

04:06.454 --> 04:09.124
What does that mean?

04:09.165 --> 04:11.167
What did you do?

04:11.209 --> 04:14.337
I took her last breath.

04:16.089 --> 04:18.550
Then I laid her in the fire.

04:20.468 --> 04:23.680
You will go into the tunnel...

04:24.472 --> 04:26.349
...or you'll join her.

04:28.101 --> 04:30.353
(Katherine grunts)

04:43.324 --> 04:45.910
Do you know who I am?

04:47.370 --> 04:49.914
No.

04:49.956 --> 04:52.167
I know you.

04:52.208 --> 04:56.921
Your story was told to me
in the dark of Ag Gecidi.

04:58.381 --> 05:01.217
You were the one in the prison.

05:01.259 --> 05:04.095
You and I have much in common.

05:04.888 --> 05:08.725
We're both teachers and fathers.

05:09.517 --> 05:11.978
You were Zachary's.

05:12.020 --> 05:14.647
I was Mal'akh's.

05:15.398 --> 05:18.818
You did this to him.

05:18.860 --> 05:22.864
I played my role,
you played yours.

05:25.241 --> 05:28.036
And what role do you play now?

05:28.078 --> 05:30.789
CIA lackey?

05:31.581 --> 05:34.709
I'm helping them
to find the ancient wisdom.

05:34.751 --> 05:39.047
And you are going to help,
as well.

05:39.089 --> 05:42.550
I withstood the torture
of your student.

05:42.592 --> 05:45.595
I'll withstand you.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.723
Mm.

05:57.732 --> 06:00.777
There are things
I never showed Zachary.

06:03.238 --> 06:07.784
But today I will show you.

06:18.586 --> 06:23.091
* I fall *

06:23.133 --> 06:27.137
* To pieces *

06:28.096 --> 06:30.932
* How can I be *

06:30.974 --> 06:34.686
* Just your friend? *

06:34.728 --> 06:35.979
He'll kill Katherine

06:36.021 --> 06:37.856
if I don't bring Peter
to the Monument,

06:37.897 --> 06:40.567
but bringing Peter
has its own risks.

06:40.608 --> 06:42.861
He's the final instrument.

06:42.902 --> 06:45.113
Might be moot anyway.
He disappeared from the temple.

06:45.155 --> 06:47.115
I have...
I have no idea where he is.

06:47.157 --> 06:49.284
I do.

06:49.325 --> 06:51.286
Blake has him.

06:51.327 --> 06:54.622
Blake?

06:54.664 --> 06:56.166
Where?

06:56.207 --> 06:57.500
Not far from here.

06:57.542 --> 06:59.210
I'm not even supposed to know.

06:59.252 --> 07:00.879
Adamu told me.

07:04.758 --> 07:07.385
Thank you.

07:07.427 --> 07:08.845
Well, can you get him out?

07:08.887 --> 07:11.514
If he wants Peter
as some kind of sacrifice...

07:11.556 --> 07:13.141
I'll figure it out.

07:13.183 --> 07:15.185
I just want to be clear
about what you're suggesting.

07:15.226 --> 07:16.853
I'm not suggesting anything.
I...

07:19.022 --> 07:21.733
I'm not gonna let that happen.
I-I just need to get Peter

07:21.775 --> 07:24.110
to the Monument
to buy Katherine time.

07:24.903 --> 07:27.030
The director has started
sweeping up Leviathan members.

07:27.072 --> 07:30.492
Wants to hang the Cascade thing
around their neck.

07:30.533 --> 07:32.911
-Good.
-I'm pretty sure

07:32.952 --> 07:34.871
they got the one
that went after you

07:34.913 --> 07:37.707
and Katherine at the cemetery.
Name's Knopp.

07:37.749 --> 07:39.042
Lobbyist.

07:39.084 --> 07:41.378
Apparently,
they found a stockpile

07:41.419 --> 07:42.712
of gas grenades at his place.

07:42.754 --> 07:45.131
I don't really care
about any of this.

07:45.173 --> 07:46.800
You should.

07:47.884 --> 07:50.595
Might be exactly what we need.

07:59.979 --> 08:03.274
Zachary shared things with me.

08:03.316 --> 08:04.734
His anger.

08:04.776 --> 08:06.319
His memories.

08:06.361 --> 08:08.071
His life in your shadow.

08:08.113 --> 08:11.366
His first instruction in death.

08:11.408 --> 08:13.660
You'd taken him to a lake.

08:13.702 --> 08:16.371
There was a bucket
to catch minnows.

08:16.413 --> 08:18.415
A pail, a tin pail.
It was his sister's.

08:18.456 --> 08:21.626
Do you remember
what was in the bucket, Peter?

08:23.294 --> 08:24.879
No.

08:25.630 --> 08:27.090
You do.

08:27.132 --> 08:30.635
You remember then
as if it was now.

08:32.637 --> 08:34.180
(grunts)

08:34.222 --> 08:35.974
Because then...

08:37.100 --> 08:38.810
...is now.

08:39.811 --> 08:41.855
(Samyaza exhaling sharply)

08:46.860 --> 08:48.945
See it, Peter.

08:50.905 --> 08:52.866
See me, Father.

08:55.994 --> 08:57.162
-I just...
-...found him like this.

08:57.203 --> 08:58.872
-I didn't do it.
-(Zach mouths)

09:01.166 --> 09:02.250
It's not moving.

09:04.586 --> 09:05.920
It's an owl.

09:05.962 --> 09:08.131
It's a barn owlet.

09:08.173 --> 09:10.800
It must have fallen
from its nest.

09:10.842 --> 09:12.677
-Is it dead?
-Dead?

09:13.636 --> 09:15.805
It is, yes.

09:15.847 --> 09:17.307
I don't want it to be.

09:17.349 --> 09:19.059
Bring it back.

09:19.100 --> 09:20.643
Please, bring it back.

09:20.685 --> 09:22.645
Zachary, I can't do that.

09:22.687 --> 09:23.855
Yes, you can.

09:23.897 --> 09:25.815
You die, and you come back.

09:25.857 --> 09:27.359
You told me that.

09:28.860 --> 09:32.405
-We can take him to the portal.
-(Samyaza mouths)

09:35.700 --> 09:38.203
Tell me where it is.

09:40.121 --> 09:43.875
-(Samyaza mouths)
-Tell me where the portal is.

09:44.709 --> 09:46.836
(grunts)

09:55.470 --> 09:58.056
NUÑEZ:
Going on a trip, Dr. Osterman?

09:58.098 --> 10:01.226
Your timing
is a bit conspicuous.

10:01.267 --> 10:03.937
Look, please,

10:03.978 --> 10:05.397
I wanted no part of it.

10:05.438 --> 10:07.524
-This is not what I stand for.
-Relax.

10:07.565 --> 10:08.858
I don't care.

10:08.900 --> 10:11.569
I'm not CIA,
but I need your help.

10:11.611 --> 10:13.071
How'd you find me?

10:13.113 --> 10:14.864
I read your puff piece
in that tech magazine,

10:14.906 --> 10:16.783
connected a few dots.

10:16.825 --> 10:18.702
I've seen
what that Cascade device can do.

10:18.743 --> 10:19.786
I felt it.

10:19.828 --> 10:21.371
He used it?

10:21.413 --> 10:23.540
At a lake.
Killed a bunch of fish,

10:23.581 --> 10:24.958
made me bleed from my ears.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.876
He'll do worse

10:26.918 --> 10:28.378
if we don't figure a way
to shut him down

10:28.420 --> 10:30.130
or shut your weapon down.

10:34.801 --> 10:37.887
Mr. York, let's take five.

10:37.929 --> 10:40.265
(door closes)

10:42.517 --> 10:44.310
Where'd he go?

10:44.352 --> 10:47.230
I don't know.

10:53.862 --> 10:56.489
What did you tell him?

10:58.491 --> 11:00.785
I'm not sure.

11:00.827 --> 11:03.288
* *

11:13.214 --> 11:15.342
-(lock rattles)
-Open the door!

11:15.383 --> 11:18.303
* *

11:18.345 --> 11:22.015
(coughing)

11:43.661 --> 11:45.455
Breathe.

11:47.374 --> 11:49.959
* *

12:18.571 --> 12:20.615
* *

12:39.634 --> 12:41.386
(beeps)

12:45.306 --> 12:46.975
(beeping)

12:48.018 --> 12:48.977
(grunts)

12:49.019 --> 12:51.229
* *

13:05.452 --> 13:07.495
* *

13:26.181 --> 13:29.726
You have come far, haven't you?

13:29.768 --> 13:32.062
Why are you here?

13:32.103 --> 13:35.357
You and I together,

13:35.398 --> 13:37.734
seeking the stolen wisdom.

13:37.776 --> 13:40.403
This was the plan.

13:40.445 --> 13:43.406
Your plan was with Zachary,

13:43.448 --> 13:47.911
whom you left in a cell to die.

13:47.952 --> 13:49.746
Hmm.

13:49.788 --> 13:52.624
Birth. Death.

13:53.750 --> 13:56.169
Rebirth.

13:56.211 --> 13:59.089
Do you not understand?

13:59.130 --> 14:02.050
That was your final lesson.

14:02.092 --> 14:05.095
And look at you now.

14:05.136 --> 14:07.889
The angel. The messenger.

14:07.931 --> 14:09.641
Mal'akh.

14:09.683 --> 14:13.770
This tunnel will lead us
to the Monument,

14:13.812 --> 14:15.480
but this device.

14:15.522 --> 14:18.441
What are you planning with it?

14:21.236 --> 14:25.281
It will play the frequency
of creation,

14:25.323 --> 14:29.452
reveal the Lost Symbol
upon the portal,

14:29.494 --> 14:33.081
and the wisdom
will come into me.

14:35.166 --> 14:37.002
I did not teach you this.

14:37.043 --> 14:39.337
I am not you!

14:43.675 --> 14:46.428
Join with me.

14:49.848 --> 14:52.517
I don't need you.

14:56.312 --> 14:59.190
Then pass me.

15:03.528 --> 15:05.363
(grunting)

15:07.657 --> 15:09.826
SATO:
Hang on.

15:09.868 --> 15:12.120
LANGDON:
Peter.

15:13.079 --> 15:14.497
Where's Katherine?

15:14.539 --> 15:17.292
(grunting)

15:30.138 --> 15:31.389
We need to go.

15:34.059 --> 15:36.102
-Good luck.
-You, too.

15:36.144 --> 15:38.271
(grunting)

15:39.814 --> 15:40.982
(phone vibrates)

15:41.024 --> 15:42.359
Did you find Osterman?

15:42.400 --> 15:43.860
NUÑEZ:
Yeah. And get this.

15:43.902 --> 15:46.154
I found out Mal'akh's
got three of these things.

15:46.196 --> 15:49.115
If they're all triangulated
towards one spot,

15:49.157 --> 15:50.408
it creates a safe zone

15:50.450 --> 15:51.701
in the middle
where they overlap,

15:51.743 --> 15:53.495
but for everything
outside that zone,

15:53.536 --> 15:56.373
it creates what he called
a resonance catastrophe.

15:56.414 --> 15:58.667
So if they're all aimed
at the Monument...

15:58.708 --> 16:00.710
NUÑEZ:
It could bring it down.

16:00.752 --> 16:02.253
(grunting)

16:09.302 --> 16:10.720
Now,
they're all networked together,

16:10.762 --> 16:12.972
so if we knock one out,
we can knock them all out.

16:13.014 --> 16:14.724
Now we just need to find one.

16:14.766 --> 16:16.142
(grunting)

16:20.188 --> 16:21.815
(gasps)

16:21.856 --> 16:23.400
(panting)

16:44.045 --> 16:46.256
-(phone vibrates)
-Uh, hang on.

16:46.297 --> 16:48.550
I'm getting a text.
It's Katherine.

16:48.591 --> 16:50.093
Katherine.

16:50.135 --> 16:52.762
She's in the service tunnels
under the Memorial fountains.

16:52.804 --> 16:54.723
I'll meet you there.

17:01.521 --> 17:03.773
-(grunts)
-(bones crack)

17:18.163 --> 17:20.373
(panting)

17:25.837 --> 17:27.672
(screams)

17:29.257 --> 17:31.176
(grunting)

17:45.398 --> 17:47.525
PETER: I suppose it's fitting
if the mystery should end here

17:47.567 --> 17:49.069
at Washington's Monument.

17:49.110 --> 17:52.572
Beginning with his apotheosis,
ending with his monument.

17:54.282 --> 17:55.492
Where do you think he is?

17:55.533 --> 17:57.327
When he first called, he said

17:57.369 --> 17:59.329
I should open a portal
buried in the city.

17:59.371 --> 18:02.123
That's what he thinks, at least.

18:02.165 --> 18:04.417
As above, so below.

18:05.251 --> 18:06.961
The basement.

18:13.927 --> 18:15.345
No. No. No.

18:15.387 --> 18:17.263
(grunts)

18:18.932 --> 18:20.600
(grunts)

18:33.613 --> 18:35.865
SATO:
She said the service tunnels,

18:35.907 --> 18:37.534
but there are miles of them
down here.

18:37.575 --> 18:39.077
We'll just have to keep looking.

18:39.119 --> 18:41.830
(sighs) The Monument's
about to open to the public.

18:41.871 --> 18:44.040
Someone needs to get there
and keep people away.

18:44.082 --> 18:45.875
All right, I'll just stay here
and look for this thing.

18:45.917 --> 18:50.296
Oh, take these earplugs.
Osterman says they might help.

18:50.338 --> 18:51.965
What about you?

19:03.226 --> 19:05.186
-(whimpers)
-Sit.

19:05.228 --> 19:07.105
(grunts)

19:07.147 --> 19:09.733
(groans)

19:20.910 --> 19:23.621
Did she suffer?

19:24.414 --> 19:26.624
Mom?

19:29.085 --> 19:31.338
She made her choice.

19:34.966 --> 19:37.677
If you won't listen to me
as your sister,

19:37.719 --> 19:40.305
then hear me as a scientist.

19:40.347 --> 19:42.223
We are decades away
from learning

19:42.265 --> 19:44.184
how to use resonance
like you're talking about.

19:44.225 --> 19:47.812
This cosmic download apotheosis,
it's not possible.

19:53.818 --> 19:57.030
You used to believe
in the impossible.

19:58.490 --> 20:00.867
That's why
you were his favorite.

20:15.507 --> 20:18.468
Jesus could heal.

20:19.302 --> 20:21.513
But there were many others.

20:22.597 --> 20:26.601
Peter healed
a man crippled from birth

20:26.643 --> 20:28.269
with a look.

20:28.311 --> 20:31.523
Paul resurrected
the boy Eutychus.

20:31.564 --> 20:34.484
These men were in tune.

20:37.195 --> 20:39.280
(breathing deeply)

20:39.322 --> 20:41.700
(breathing quickening)

20:46.287 --> 20:48.581
(breathing quickening)

20:53.253 --> 20:55.005
(breathing deepening, slowing)

21:07.600 --> 21:10.437
(breathing normally)

21:17.068 --> 21:19.487
When we are in tune
with the vibration,

21:19.529 --> 21:21.656
our consciousness

21:21.698 --> 21:23.992
touches the source of knowledge,

21:24.034 --> 21:26.453
and we remember.

21:35.045 --> 21:38.631
Today,
I remember how to be a god.

22:00.820 --> 22:02.739
PETER:
You okay?

22:23.760 --> 22:27.138
Uh, uh, w-wait, we need
to come up with a plan.

22:27.180 --> 22:28.723
What are... What are we gonna do
once we find him?

22:28.765 --> 22:31.935
-Just gonna talk to him.
-Talk to him?

22:32.727 --> 22:34.229
I'm his father.

22:34.270 --> 22:37.107
-Peter.
-I'm not gonna let Katherine
get hurt.

22:37.148 --> 22:38.316
Trust me.

22:38.358 --> 22:40.026
(elevator thuds)

22:44.698 --> 22:47.826
-What are you doing?
-I'm sorry.
I have no other choice.

22:47.867 --> 22:49.953
LANGDON:
No, no, no.

22:49.994 --> 22:51.621
No. Peter.

22:51.663 --> 22:53.206
No, no. No.
No, you can't do this.

22:53.248 --> 22:54.833
He will kill you.

22:54.874 --> 22:57.002
-He wants me.
There's no other way.
-No! Peter,

22:57.043 --> 22:59.004
do not do this!
You can't do this!

22:59.045 --> 23:02.007
-Peter, please!
-Look after her, please,
Robert, will you?

23:02.048 --> 23:03.717
Peter!

23:04.676 --> 23:06.886
God! No!

23:16.771 --> 23:18.982
* *

23:48.094 --> 23:50.138
* *

24:15.330 --> 24:17.374
* *

24:37.977 --> 24:39.854
PETER:
I'm here.

24:43.024 --> 24:44.693
Dad, what are you doing?

24:44.734 --> 24:46.653
You're alone.

24:46.695 --> 24:48.363
Where's Robert?

24:48.405 --> 24:51.157
He brought me.
That's all you asked of him.

24:54.202 --> 24:57.664
If I am to be your instrument,
so be it.

24:57.706 --> 25:00.208
Take what's left of my life,

25:00.250 --> 25:02.669
but let Kate go.

25:02.711 --> 25:05.755
You still don't understand.

25:21.438 --> 25:25.358
-Hey.
I just called it in to Metro.
-They won't get here in time.

25:25.400 --> 25:27.736
-We need to get
these people out.
-You got it.

25:27.777 --> 25:30.030
(grunts)

25:38.913 --> 25:40.165
DRIVER:
All right, ladies and gentlemen,

25:40.206 --> 25:41.541
welcome
to the Washington Monument.

25:41.583 --> 25:43.418
-As you disembark...
-Everyone, sit down.

25:44.169 --> 25:45.545
You need to get out of here
right away.

25:45.587 --> 25:47.339
What are you...
What are you talking about?

25:47.380 --> 25:49.049
-Who the hell are you?
-CIA.

25:49.090 --> 25:50.884
-There is an imminent threat...
-(laughs): CIA.

25:50.925 --> 25:53.386
Yeah, right. And I'm Tom Hanks.

26:01.728 --> 26:03.938
Show me.

26:06.441 --> 26:07.776
(beeping)

26:09.694 --> 26:12.113
(beeping quickens)

26:12.155 --> 26:14.699
-(tone pulsing)
-(vibrating)

26:14.741 --> 26:15.992
(groans)

26:16.034 --> 26:17.702
-(high-pitched whirring)
-(all groan)

26:17.744 --> 26:20.080
-(tone continues)
-(grunts)

26:25.627 --> 26:26.920
Damn it!

26:33.301 --> 26:35.011
-(high-pitched whirring)
-(passengers whimpering)

26:35.053 --> 26:37.889
-(grunts) Go. Now.
-Yeah, yeah.

26:37.931 --> 26:39.432
(tone pulsing)

26:41.893 --> 26:43.144
No!

26:46.106 --> 26:48.525
(overlapping shouting)

26:50.819 --> 26:53.488
* *

27:05.959 --> 27:08.169
* *

27:25.520 --> 27:27.981
Triquetra?

27:28.023 --> 27:29.315
What is it?

27:29.357 --> 27:33.570
It's the oldest symbols
of spirituality.

27:33.611 --> 27:35.989
The power of three.

27:36.031 --> 27:38.241
A trinity.

27:38.283 --> 27:42.203
You've studied the ancient ways
your entire life.

27:43.038 --> 27:45.165
You know the power
of the mysteries

27:45.206 --> 27:47.542
relies on sacrifice.

27:49.711 --> 27:52.589
A soul must be released.

28:09.314 --> 28:12.942
If there is any shred of honor
left in you,

28:12.984 --> 28:15.945
let her go.

28:19.657 --> 28:21.826
No, I'm not leaving.

28:21.868 --> 28:24.954
Then watch.

28:33.046 --> 28:35.382
This is iron from heaven.

28:36.132 --> 28:37.926
A blade forged from a meteorite

28:37.967 --> 28:39.552
and touched by God

28:39.594 --> 28:42.097
the day Abraham submitted
to the volitions

28:42.138 --> 28:44.516
of the supreme being

28:44.557 --> 28:47.435
by proffering Isaac.

28:48.561 --> 28:50.689
The Akedah dagger?

28:52.023 --> 28:54.943
It was never used
for its true purpose.

28:56.027 --> 28:58.947
Until now.

29:02.701 --> 29:05.203
(breathes deeply)

29:19.384 --> 29:23.096
You are not the offering, Peter.

29:27.559 --> 29:29.686
I am.

29:39.070 --> 29:41.698
Upon the portal,

29:41.740 --> 29:43.616
I will die

29:43.658 --> 29:48.455
and be reborn
imbued with wisdom beyond.

30:01.968 --> 30:04.220
MAN:
Keep going.

30:10.852 --> 30:13.438
Open your eyes.

30:14.522 --> 30:16.566
* *

30:32.040 --> 30:34.250
(panting)

31:00.985 --> 31:02.737
* *

31:31.016 --> 31:33.268
* *

32:03.631 --> 32:05.300
(grunts)

32:08.928 --> 32:11.306
You must end me.

32:11.348 --> 32:14.476
-Son...
-You must take responsibility!

32:15.310 --> 32:18.313
Finally! Ultimately!

32:22.859 --> 32:24.152
Do it.

32:26.905 --> 32:29.157
(loud vibrating, whirring)

32:32.202 --> 32:34.162
-Do it now!
-No! No!

32:35.205 --> 32:37.082
You're doing this for nothing.

32:37.123 --> 32:39.292
Here is your ancient wisdom.

32:40.085 --> 32:42.671
Buried in the cornerstone,
w-what you might call a portal.

32:42.712 --> 32:45.215
It's a Bible,
just a King James Bible.

32:45.256 --> 32:49.511
It was all just a myth,
a metaphor.

32:52.597 --> 32:54.849
-(tone continues pulsing)
-(grunting)

33:01.648 --> 33:05.110
Your stalling will
only delay the inevitable.

33:05.151 --> 33:06.361
I'm not stalling.

33:06.403 --> 33:09.656
That is all there is.

33:14.035 --> 33:17.747
You expect me to believe that
after all these safeguards...

33:19.457 --> 33:21.751
...all the secrecy...

33:24.212 --> 33:26.339
Was for that?

33:28.174 --> 33:29.467
No!

33:32.095 --> 33:34.597
That makes no sense.

33:35.390 --> 33:38.852
It makes perfect sense.

33:40.228 --> 33:42.230
(tone stops)

33:47.736 --> 33:51.489
No. No!

33:53.199 --> 33:56.953
-(blade pierces)
-(gasps)

34:01.124 --> 34:03.376
* *

34:29.736 --> 34:31.488
* *

34:40.121 --> 34:42.332
* *

35:03.853 --> 35:05.897
* *

35:31.548 --> 35:33.091
NUÑEZ:
What do you think?

35:33.133 --> 35:34.884
Makes me look
distinguished, right?

35:34.926 --> 35:38.638
Like I'm ready to hang
with this guy.

35:38.680 --> 35:41.307
How long do they think
you'll need it for?

35:41.349 --> 35:43.810
Doc says a few weeks, maybe.

35:43.852 --> 35:45.937
I guess until
the dizziness goes away.

35:45.979 --> 35:48.773
And what then?
Back to the Capitol?

35:48.815 --> 35:52.485
Nah, I promised Zoe
I'd find something

35:52.527 --> 35:54.654
with less drama.

35:54.696 --> 35:56.906
I owe that to her.

35:56.948 --> 35:59.284
You owe it to yourself,
I would think.

35:59.325 --> 36:02.996
I suppose we could all do with
a bit of simplicity

36:03.038 --> 36:05.123
in our lives right now.

36:06.124 --> 36:08.835
So, after all that,

36:08.877 --> 36:12.630
the wisdom turned out to be
an old Bible?

36:12.672 --> 36:15.133
Yeah, just a book.

36:15.175 --> 36:18.678
Only a skeptic would say,
"It's just a book," Robert.

36:18.720 --> 36:21.973
The Bible has a profound message
for us.

36:22.015 --> 36:25.518
We all possess the ability
to become godlike.

36:25.560 --> 36:29.522
Jesus, Yeshua, said as much.

36:29.564 --> 36:33.526
"The works that I do,
you can do, and greater."

36:33.568 --> 36:37.489
-So the wisdom...
-Lies within us all.

36:37.530 --> 36:39.866
Metaphorically.

36:41.076 --> 36:42.285
(phone vibrates)

36:42.327 --> 36:44.537
Ah, yeah, it's Zoe

36:44.579 --> 36:46.998
reminding me about PT.

36:48.083 --> 36:51.419
-Sir, real pleasure.
-Absolutely.

36:51.461 --> 36:53.755
Sorry.

36:55.590 --> 36:58.051
So glad I got to
see you off, man.

36:58.093 --> 37:00.095
Take care.

37:01.846 --> 37:04.265
No, uh, tracking
devices, I hope.

37:04.307 --> 37:06.518
Far as you know.

37:12.732 --> 37:14.359
Everything all right?

37:14.401 --> 37:17.654
You locked me in a barely
operational antique elevator,

37:17.696 --> 37:20.532
so we should probably talk
about that at some point.

37:20.573 --> 37:22.158
I'm sorry, I had to do it.

37:25.829 --> 37:28.748
Is that really what's
bothering you?

37:30.166 --> 37:31.960
Maybe there was a part
of me that wanted

37:32.002 --> 37:35.130
the ancient wisdom to be
more than just...

37:35.171 --> 37:37.382
a metaphor.

37:37.424 --> 37:42.262
And what if it is more
than that?

37:42.303 --> 37:45.223
You know of the stories
of a code in the Bible.

37:45.265 --> 37:48.101
Francis Bacon, William Blake,
all those luminaries thought

37:48.143 --> 37:49.894
there was something hidden
in those pages.

37:49.936 --> 37:52.272
-Sure, but...
-But think of it.

37:52.313 --> 37:54.774
It's a bizarre book of stories

37:54.816 --> 37:56.693
filled with contradictions,

37:56.735 --> 37:58.737
with outdated beliefs,

37:58.778 --> 38:01.114
with outright absurdities.

38:01.156 --> 38:02.949
Peter, you're trying to
argue that there could be

38:02.991 --> 38:05.952
some ancient wisdom
encrypted within the Bible?

38:05.994 --> 38:07.829
The Torah, the Qur'an,
the Upanishads,

38:07.871 --> 38:09.998
there's a reason why these
ancient texts have endured.

38:10.040 --> 38:12.959
People sense there is
a power in them

38:13.001 --> 38:15.795
that we have yet to understand.

38:16.755 --> 38:20.175
We just stopped looking for it.

38:24.346 --> 38:28.683
Of course, it's never too late
to start looking again.

38:55.210 --> 38:58.755
Zach and I used to ride our
bikes here when we were kids.

39:00.840 --> 39:03.176
You know how something can feel
like yesterday

39:03.218 --> 39:06.513
and a lifetime ago
at the same time?

39:06.554 --> 39:08.515
You mean our capacity for

39:08.556 --> 39:10.934
-autonoetic consciousness or...
-No, I don't mean...

39:13.061 --> 39:14.729
I'm just talking.

39:15.897 --> 39:18.066
At least now I know
you've been listening.

39:19.609 --> 39:22.529
-How's the arm feel?
-It's okay.

39:22.570 --> 39:25.031
X-rays showed a microfracture.

39:26.074 --> 39:28.702
Maybe that's all it ever was.

39:34.582 --> 39:37.460
You had to do what you did.

39:37.502 --> 39:38.962
I know.

39:40.547 --> 39:43.508
Necessity is harsh.

39:43.550 --> 39:46.219
Fate has no reprieve.

39:47.846 --> 39:50.765
There's just so much I wish
I could ask him.

39:50.807 --> 39:52.308
You don't need him.

39:52.350 --> 39:55.895
You've devoted your life to
finding answers in places

39:55.937 --> 39:58.106
others wouldn't dare look.

39:58.148 --> 40:03.153
Your intuition has been right
at-at every turn.

40:04.946 --> 40:07.824
Sorry for
the moments I doubted it.

40:10.618 --> 40:13.288
So, what, now you
believe in my field?

40:14.456 --> 40:16.291
I believe in you.

40:20.587 --> 40:22.630
(sighs)

40:22.672 --> 40:24.966
-I don't have to go.
-Yes, you do.

40:26.051 --> 40:29.179
If this is gonna work,
we have to take it slow.

40:29.220 --> 40:34.351
Figure out who we are
outside of... everything.

40:36.311 --> 40:40.982
I'll be back in two weeks.
That slow enough?

40:57.290 --> 40:59.918
* *

41:05.298 --> 41:11.096
* Time, pulling like
a feather *

41:12.347 --> 41:16.226
* From your eyes *

41:16.267 --> 41:22.899
* Try, try to live it better *

41:22.941 --> 41:27.487
* Bide your time *

41:27.529 --> 41:30.949
* Desire *

41:30.990 --> 41:34.661
* I am barely thinking *

41:34.703 --> 41:38.832
* In the dark *

41:38.873 --> 41:42.419
* And life,
life is what you wanted. *

41:42.460 --> 41:45.672
LANGDON: What is this
yearning in us to believe?

41:45.714 --> 41:48.258
We believe in things we cannot
see and things for which

41:48.299 --> 41:50.802
there is
insufficient evidence.

41:52.053 --> 41:53.888
We call that faith.

41:53.930 --> 41:55.598
Allegedly, it's a virtue.

41:55.640 --> 41:59.185
In the Abrahamic religions,
the forefather Abraham

41:59.227 --> 42:00.729
was revered for his faith.

42:00.770 --> 42:04.149
Nearly kills his son Isaac,
'cause God commands it.

42:04.190 --> 42:05.525
Then, when God reverses himself,

42:05.567 --> 42:10.071
says that it was just a test
of his faith.

42:10.113 --> 42:14.993
Here's my question.
If Abraham is having

42:15.035 --> 42:19.080
conversations with God,
he has evidence of God.

42:21.124 --> 42:24.252
What does he need faith for?

42:25.378 --> 42:29.883
This weekend you will all
imagine you hear

42:29.924 --> 42:32.218
the voice of God.

42:32.260 --> 42:35.221
It may or may not sound
a lot like my voice.

42:35.263 --> 42:37.891
-(laughter)
-Up-up to you.

42:37.932 --> 42:42.729
Then you'll write a thousand
words on why you believe it...

42:42.771 --> 42:44.856
or why you don't.

42:45.982 --> 42:47.400
See you Monday.

43:12.342 --> 43:14.386
* *

43:27.357 --> 43:30.902
Brushing up on your
Genesis?

43:32.862 --> 43:35.365
Something like that.

43:35.407 --> 43:36.616
How are you?

43:36.658 --> 43:39.911
I was worried you were in
some secret prison.

43:39.953 --> 43:44.082
Something's come up.
I need your expertise.

43:44.124 --> 43:47.419
I'm not sure how useful
I can be to the CIA.

43:47.460 --> 43:49.087
Not the CIA.

43:49.129 --> 43:53.216
I was recruited by a private
outfit: Global Reach.

43:53.258 --> 43:57.095
-Nationless spies.
-Something like that.

43:59.556 --> 44:03.476
We're looking into a bombing
in Europe.

44:03.518 --> 44:07.022
No one's claimed
responsibility, but...

44:07.063 --> 44:10.942
whoever it was left this.

44:13.028 --> 44:15.655
Do you know what it means?

44:15.697 --> 44:18.658
Sure.

44:18.700 --> 44:21.077
How fast can you pack?

44:22.871 --> 44:24.706
Depends.

44:24.748 --> 44:24.873
Where am I going?
