This was about ﬁve years ago.

07:25.520 --> 07:27.659
There was this guy a few towns over.

07:29.240 --> 07:31.549
Everyone said he was the one to beat,

07:32.400 --> 07:35.380
so I went over there

see through all the damn smoke.

but calling these highbinders

16:47.280 --> 16:48.941

All right. I'll give it some thought.

But right now, I need you
to apply your talents elsewhere.

17:07.720 --> 17:08.709
What's this?

17:09.280 --> 17:10.463
It's a shotgun, Lee.

17:12.320 --> 17:14.379
I want you to take it
and sit outside my house tonight.

17:15.360 --> 17:16.497
There's an Old rocker on the porch.

17:16.600 --> 17:18.306

You'll know him if you see him.

17:24.720 --> 17:26.039
What's going on, Bill?

17:28.560 --> 17:31.120
Just do this for me. Please.

17:32.400 --> 17:33.469
I'll be back before dawn.

17:35.360 --> 17:36.384
And if not?

17:37.400 --> 17:38.469
Well, then, um,

17:39.960 --> 17:41.279
I guess you'll get a promotion.

17:59.840 --> 18:01.785
The Fung Hai have always
kept to their territory.

18:01.880 --> 18:03.859
Why would they attack us
without provocation?

18:03.960 --> 18:06.520
'Cause they made a deal
to be extra muscle for the Long Zii.

18:06.600 --> 18:08.306
That's absurd. Who told you that?

18:08.440 --> 18:09.702
A reliable source.

18:09.800 --> 18:11.665
And the last thing we need
is for those mongy bastards

18:12.040 --> 18:13.940
to think that they can breathe
the same air as us.

18:14.920 --> 18:16.547
We're gonna put them down

18:16.640 --> 18:18.301
and send a message to the Long Zii
at the same time.

18:18.400 --> 18:20.186
You're talking about starting a war.

18:20.280 --> 18:23.147
Look around.
The war's already started.

18:23.720 --> 18:25.347
They drew first blood.

18:25.840 --> 18:28.547
Anything short Of burning them down
is just us showing our bellies.

18:28.640 --> 18:30.949
I know you're angry. We all are.

18:31.040 --> 18:33.782
But now is the time
for careful consideration,

18:33.880 --> 18:35.507
not an emotional reaction.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.627
I'm just not sure Father Jun
would approve Of such...

18:37.760 --> 18:39.785
This is Young Jun's call.

their own resources,

20:59.040 --> 21:01.019

the ocean to deplete ours.

21:02.280 --> 21:04.384

to this immigration.

looking for the gold mountain.

38:47.440 --> 38:48.907
But the pale fucks lied to us.

38:49.000 --> 38:50.979
The gold wasn't on the mountain.
It was under it.

38:51.480 --> 38:53.380
And while the coolies and the worms
broke their humps

38:53.480 --> 38:56.187
building duck railroads
and mining duck ore,

39:00.040 --> 39:02.679
I have no desire
for our houses to go to war.

39:03.880 --> 39:05.199
But you fucked up.

39:06.440 --> 39:09.546
There can be no peace
until the Fung Hai are dealt with.

39:10.880 --> 39:12.199
Those are my terms.

39:26.640 --> 39:27.629
Of course.

39:29.320 --> 39:31.959
I will see to it immediately.

39:42.440 --> 39:44.817
Fuckers try to dice you,
you shake his hand?

39:45.560 --> 39:46.948
Only to say goodbye.

39:49.360 --> 39:51.066
We won't be seeing him again.

39:58.840 --> 40:00.023
What did he say?

40:01.400 --> 40:03.709
It doesn't matter what he said.

40:05.880 --> 40:07.268
They're going to kill me.

40:40.360 --> 40:42.499
You lOOk chewed up,
spit out and stepped on.

40:44.720 --> 40:47.700
Well, that's better than I feel.

40:50.280 --> 40:51.417
But you made it home.

40:54.200 --> 40:55.269
I made it home.

40:58.960 --> 41:00.063
All right, then.

41:01.960 --> 41:03.097
See you at work.

41:04.360 --> 41:05.861
What, that's it?

41:05.960 --> 41:07.427
You're not gonna ask me what happened?

41:08.640 --> 41:09.823
Would you tell me if I did?

41:15.600 --> 41:16.589
That's what I thought.

41:20.800 --> 41:21.789
Thank you, Lee.

41:42.320 --> 41:44.220
LUCY: Kids are up. I could use a hand.

41:44.680 --> 41:46.545
I just need to sleep,
just a few hours.

41:46.640 --> 41:47.982
How bad is it this time?

41:48.080 --> 41:49.547
Everything's fine. I took care Of it.

41:49.640 --> 41:51.301
Sure, that's why there was
an armed cop

41:51.400 --> 41:52.742
sitting outside our house all night.

41:53.320 --> 41:54.981
I said I took care of it.

41:55.080 --> 41:57.184
I remember when that
used to mean something!
