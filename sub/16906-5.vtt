For life. So you know,
a couple more months.

18:02.053 --> 18:04.387
You must have a lot of bad
jokes about deceased celebrities

18:04.406 --> 18:06.073
just filling up your brain.

18:06.107 --> 18:09.392
Yes, and they're pushing out
important information.

18:09.411 --> 18:11.228
I don't know
where I live, lady.

18:11.246 --> 18:12.579
If I got you
back on Twitter,

18:12.614 --> 18:13.747
how quickly could you
get kicked off again?

18:13.782 --> 18:14.998
10, 15 minutes.

18:15.033 --> 18:17.234
Less if I count genocide
as celebrities.

18:17.252 --> 18:20.570
Okay, well, you're getting
back on on Jenna's account.

18:20.588 --> 18:22.840
No, I can't do that
to my dear friend and co-worker

18:22.874 --> 18:24.174
Jenna Jameson.

18:24.209 --> 18:25.292
No, Tracy, Jenna Maroney.

18:25.343 --> 18:27.177
- Cool.
- Okay.

18:27.212 --> 18:29.263
All I have to do is figure out
Jenna's password.

18:29.297 --> 18:31.799
How 'bout "me69"?

18:31.850 --> 18:34.835
Yep.

18:34.869 --> 18:36.419
Oh, Tracy, no.

18:36.438 --> 18:38.088
No, I can say that word.
I'm black.

18:38.106 --> 18:41.424
But Dick Clark wasn't.

18:44.095 --> 18:45.779
Hey! You're not
really leaving, are ya?

18:45.814 --> 18:47.030
I know it's the second time,

18:47.065 --> 18:49.149
but it's our last shot
at feeling...

18:49.200 --> 18:50.400
This.

18:50.434 --> 18:52.269
Then what? Someday maybe
we elect a wheelchair guy?

18:52.287 --> 18:55.823
Okay, great, but not fun.

18:55.874 --> 18:57.741
Look, Pete,
this isn't 2008.

18:57.775 --> 19:01.444
I don't know, maybe if
more stuff really had changed.

19:01.463 --> 19:02.629
Hey, sugar lips.

19:02.664 --> 19:05.966
Let's make like
a black magazine and <i>Jet.</i>

19:11.556 --> 19:12.506
What's up, guy?

19:12.557 --> 19:13.757
Thanks for keeping
my lady warm

19:13.791 --> 19:15.792
while I turn on my hot tub
with my phone.

19:15.810 --> 19:16.844
Come on, baby.

19:16.895 --> 19:19.396
My 2012 corvette's
parked outside.

19:19.430 --> 19:22.149
'Cause I always
find a parking spot.

19:22.183 --> 19:25.302
- You're him.
- That's right, pops.

19:25.320 --> 19:26.653
I'm Peter horn.

19:26.688 --> 19:27.905
All day...

19:27.939 --> 19:31.608
And all night.

19:38.783 --> 19:39.900
Well, well,

19:39.934 --> 19:43.653
well, well,
well, well, well,

19:43.671 --> 19:44.988
well...
Nope, that's too many "Wells."

19:45.006 --> 19:46.656
I'm gonna reenter.

19:46.674 --> 19:48.175
Just spit it out, Lemon.

19:48.209 --> 19:49.593
I stole a page
from your playbook, Jack.

19:49.627 --> 19:52.262
I used Tracy,
I committed cyber crime,

19:52.297 --> 19:56.099
I got Jenna kicked off Twitter
before she could endorse Romney.

19:56.134 --> 19:58.769
Deviousness? I guess two
can play at that game.

19:58.803 --> 20:00.721
Just like most games.

20:00.772 --> 20:02.022
And now you're smiling

20:02.056 --> 20:03.023
because you're gonna
try to tell me

20:03.057 --> 20:04.441
that this was your plan
all along.

20:04.475 --> 20:05.809
"Oh, I turned you
into me, Lemon.

20:05.843 --> 20:07.561
It was my plan all along."

20:07.612 --> 20:09.229
No, I'm smiling because
I ended up telling Jenna

20:09.280 --> 20:10.647
not to do anything at all.

20:10.681 --> 20:13.016
I didn't want her
choosing our president.

20:13.034 --> 20:16.203
No one should grow up
in Jenna Maroney's America.

20:16.237 --> 20:17.654
'Cause of the children?

20:17.688 --> 20:20.290
Did my one-woman show
actually change your mind?

20:20.325 --> 20:21.959
Should I workshop it
at the fringe festival?

20:21.993 --> 20:24.378
- Sure.
- Typical Donaghy.

20:24.412 --> 20:28.665
You sentimental, self-righteous,
badger-faced shrew.

20:28.699 --> 20:30.000
Typical Lemon.

20:30.034 --> 20:33.536
You cynical, manipulative,
cold-blooded adonis.

20:33.555 --> 20:37.140
So maybe we rubbed off
on each other after all.

20:37.175 --> 20:39.042
[Glasses clink]

20:39.060 --> 20:40.394
Mm...

20:40.428 --> 20:42.646
Oh, yours dripped on me
and now I'm drunk.

20:42.680 --> 20:45.899
Good Lord in heaven.

20:48.733 --> 20:51.067
The Georgia polls close
in two minutes.

20:55.944 --> 20:57.494
[Whistles]

20:57.529 --> 20:59.997
[Eagle screeching]

21:03.668 --> 21:05.202
Mr. Hornberger,

21:05.253 --> 21:06.486
I just voted!

21:06.504 --> 21:08.038
Doesn't it just
fill you with hope?

21:08.089 --> 21:11.024
Like anything can happen?

21:11.059 --> 21:13.927
All day, all night, baby.

21:13.962 --> 21:16.513
Mmm! Hmm?

21:17.032 --> 21:20.532
