WEBVTT

00:19.477 --> 00:20.520
<i>Drop that!</i>

00:20.603 --> 00:22.439
-<i>Go, go, go.</i>
-Go, go, go!

00:26.109 --> 00:27.527
<i>Code five!</i>

00:29.404 --> 00:31.906
Son, you'll be late for the interview.

00:35.952 --> 00:38.288
Is killing people in a game
really fun for you?

00:41.291 --> 00:42.459
Shit!

00:44.502 --> 00:45.628
<i>Go, go, go, go!</i>

01:03.480 --> 01:05.065
Come on! Up the stairs! We can make it!

01:06.566 --> 01:07.609
Come on, run!

01:14.240 --> 01:15.533
Come on! Over--

01:21.664 --> 01:25.085
13 MINUTES AGO

01:39.057 --> 01:41.142
None of the games have started yet.

01:42.894 --> 01:44.521
Maybe we still have time.

01:45.146 --> 01:48.066
Or they forgot
to push the big red start button.

01:48.650 --> 01:51.319
They didn't even tell us
about the rules for this one.

02:06.042 --> 02:07.168
What is it?

02:10.755 --> 02:12.006
I hear something.

02:37.907 --> 02:40.201
They're alive. Beach people.

03:09.689 --> 03:10.773
What is this?

03:12.025 --> 03:13.193
What are you doing here?

03:13.276 --> 03:14.652
We saw the blimps show up.

03:15.195 --> 03:17.655
There are rumors
that the next stage is starting.

03:18.406 --> 03:19.407
Right…

03:20.450 --> 03:21.367
Here's the thing--

03:23.286 --> 03:24.495
Huh?

03:27.457 --> 03:28.666
Oh God!

03:28.750 --> 03:29.751
A rifle.

03:29.834 --> 03:31.294
-What's happening?
-Get moving.

03:31.377 --> 03:32.754
Run to the car!

03:32.837 --> 03:34.839
That thing's an anti-tank rifle.

03:37.091 --> 03:41.054
-So I'd forget about hiding behind a car.
-What the hell?

03:41.137 --> 03:42.639
Where's it coming from?

03:43.848 --> 03:45.058
Run! Run!

03:49.187 --> 03:51.522
-Does this mean the game's started?
-I don't know.

03:51.606 --> 03:53.024
Did they give us any rules?

03:53.107 --> 03:55.610
Without rules,
this is just a massacre!

03:58.321 --> 04:00.698
That rifle can kill from a kilometer away.

04:02.617 --> 04:05.370
Damn it, I recognize that sound.

04:05.453 --> 04:07.247
Now we've got an assault rifle.

04:07.330 --> 04:09.207
We have no idea how many there are.

04:09.290 --> 04:11.376
Other players are starting
to group together.

04:11.459 --> 04:13.628
-Could be more than one shooter.
-Getting closer!

04:13.711 --> 04:16.339
I had no idea
so many players were still alive.

04:16.422 --> 04:17.590
Run!

04:17.674 --> 04:19.509
They're almost here.

04:20.593 --> 04:21.886
We have to go!

04:21.970 --> 04:23.513
-Come on!
-Help me!

04:28.893 --> 04:29.852
Let's go!

04:31.604 --> 04:32.689
Arisu!

04:33.481 --> 04:34.941
This is bad!

04:35.775 --> 04:37.360
We need to split up!

04:55.503 --> 04:57.797
<i>Kill, kill, kill, kill!</i>
<i>Go, go, go!</i>

04:58.756 --> 05:00.675
Go! Come on!

05:26.784 --> 05:28.494
Arisu! Over here!

05:57.815 --> 05:58.816
Aah!

06:01.444 --> 06:03.988
Hey.
You skip your interview again?

06:04.739 --> 06:07.158
If only reality could be reset.

06:13.748 --> 06:15.458
Arisu!

06:39.482 --> 06:42.235
Are you trying to get killed out there?

06:43.778 --> 06:45.655
Where are they shooting from, anyway?

06:51.702 --> 06:54.914
Huh. He must be the King of Spades.

08:43.689 --> 08:45.983
Take this. A good luck charm.

08:47.026 --> 08:49.862
An explosive? You made this?

08:49.946 --> 08:51.531
Just use it if you have to.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.535
Arisu! Now's our chance!

08:58.120 --> 08:59.205
Let's go!

09:03.042 --> 09:04.752
-Arisu?
-He's still alive!

09:06.754 --> 09:08.089
Hey! You okay?

09:19.183 --> 09:20.851
The King of Spades is here.

09:24.522 --> 09:25.982
Come on!

09:26.649 --> 09:28.651
Hang in there! Get up!

09:42.081 --> 09:43.249
You all right, huh?

09:49.589 --> 09:51.549
Hey! You two okay? You hurt?

09:54.594 --> 09:56.262
Go! Go! Run!

09:59.849 --> 10:01.267
The King of Spades is

10:02.643 --> 10:04.103
just one guy.

10:07.189 --> 10:08.274
We're pinned down here!

10:08.357 --> 10:10.151
If we step out, he'll get us!

10:12.028 --> 10:12.903
Huh?

10:20.411 --> 10:21.412
Get in!

10:21.495 --> 10:22.413
Tatta!

10:22.496 --> 10:24.123
-Don't just stand there!
-Ann!

10:30.963 --> 10:31.797
Run, Chishiya!

10:34.467 --> 10:35.509
That's bad. Get going!

10:35.593 --> 10:36.636
-Drive!
-Okay!

10:37.928 --> 10:39.180
Chishiya!

10:55.738 --> 10:57.281
Okay! We're safe for now.

10:57.365 --> 10:59.158
You think Chishiya's okay?

10:59.241 --> 11:00.701
He can take care of himself.

11:00.785 --> 11:05.039
What kind of game is this, guys?
No rules. I mean, we didn't even register.

11:05.122 --> 11:08.000
-We just take the bad guys down, right?
-And how many are there?

11:08.084 --> 11:09.418
There's just the one.

11:10.795 --> 11:12.463
There's only one King of Spades.

11:12.963 --> 11:15.299
He's like the boss
of the physical challenges.

11:16.092 --> 11:18.969
During the attack,
the blimp was flying around.

11:19.595 --> 11:22.223
Maybe the battlefield
spans the whole city this time.

11:22.306 --> 11:24.600
How are we supposed to fight them
without a weapon?

11:24.684 --> 11:27.478
This next stage,
they really leveled up, huh?

11:28.688 --> 11:30.314
The next stage.

11:31.232 --> 11:35.486
<i>Let's have some fun! All of us together!</i>

11:35.569 --> 11:37.905
I mean, who is Mira? Is she human?

11:38.447 --> 11:39.657
I don't know.

11:39.740 --> 11:43.119
All I can say
is she might be one of the game masters.

11:43.202 --> 11:45.538
Mira? Game master?

11:45.621 --> 11:48.040
If we're right about the King of Spades,

11:48.541 --> 11:51.502
it's possible each suit has its own
game master at the top.

11:52.169 --> 11:55.548
We defeat all four,
we complete the next stage.

11:56.549 --> 11:57.508
We beat the bosses.

11:57.591 --> 11:58.759
Then what?

11:58.843 --> 12:00.052
We get to go home?

12:02.722 --> 12:03.973
I'm not sure yet.

12:04.515 --> 12:06.726
But that's our best chance to survive.

12:13.566 --> 12:16.068
Where are you even taking us, man?

12:16.152 --> 12:18.946
What? I'm following that car in front.

12:19.029 --> 12:22.408
-What? Is that a good idea? Who are they?
-Where should we go, then?

12:22.491 --> 12:25.745
Let's just be cool.
We escaped from the game and we're fine.

12:25.828 --> 12:27.788
That was not a game, Yui!

12:27.872 --> 12:31.292
What? We need a plan so we can win.

12:31.375 --> 12:32.460
We can't run away.

12:32.543 --> 12:35.504
That's not a bad idea. We've still got
plenty of days on our visas.

12:35.588 --> 12:36.589
That's true.

12:36.672 --> 12:39.675
-We hide until one of the others wins.
-Ooh! Yeah.

12:55.357 --> 12:58.235
Just because
we get through all the face cards safely,

12:58.319 --> 13:00.404
that doesn't mean we get to go back home.

13:01.071 --> 13:03.908
You don't believe
Hatter's bullshit now, do you?

13:03.991 --> 13:07.995
Yeah, but the next stage did start after
we got 40 different cards, like he said.

13:09.246 --> 13:12.166
<i>None of us knew</i>
<i>what was going on when we got here.</i>

13:12.249 --> 13:16.587
<i>We figured out that winning games extended</i>
<i>our visas by the number of days on a card.</i>

13:16.670 --> 13:19.256
<i>If our visas run out,</i>
<i>we're killed by a laser.</i>

13:19.840 --> 13:21.091
<i>According to Hatter,</i>

13:21.717 --> 13:25.971
<i>collecting a whole deck of cards</i>
<i>would allow us to return home.</i>

13:27.056 --> 13:29.099
The rules at least make sense.

13:29.725 --> 13:31.894
You just want it to be true.

13:31.977 --> 13:34.605
No, it's more than that.
There's a pattern.

13:35.356 --> 13:38.692
It seemed crazy,
but there were always rules.

13:48.994 --> 13:50.871
Hey, there's some Beach guys there.

13:54.500 --> 13:55.626
Tatta! Go!

13:55.709 --> 13:56.961
Aah! Hold on!

13:57.044 --> 13:58.420
Tatta!

14:16.981 --> 14:19.149
Hey! Tatta! Drive better!

14:19.233 --> 14:20.776
I can't!

14:25.447 --> 14:26.365
Let me drive now.

14:26.448 --> 14:28.075
-Eh?
-Now! Move!

14:28.158 --> 14:29.827
-Hey, careful. Shit!
-Move!

14:33.497 --> 14:34.498
Hang on.

16:06.048 --> 16:07.049
He's not there!

16:07.758 --> 16:09.176
Hey. Nice one!

16:12.805 --> 16:14.098
He's still there!

16:39.164 --> 16:40.874
Hey, Ann! Where are you taking us?

16:57.558 --> 16:58.434
Oh, shit!

17:32.968 --> 17:34.511
Hey, you guys okay?

17:35.721 --> 17:37.723
Holy shit! Did you see that?

17:40.267 --> 17:41.101
Anyone get hurt?

17:41.185 --> 17:42.853
Yeah, I twisted my neck.

17:43.353 --> 17:44.813
I broke a nail.

17:44.897 --> 17:46.231
Oh shit--

18:01.705 --> 18:03.290
Run!

18:08.462 --> 18:09.797
They're--

18:13.592 --> 18:15.844
I can't do this!

18:15.928 --> 18:18.806
-I can't!
-If you stay here, you'll die. Come on.

18:18.889 --> 18:21.892
Even if I keep running,
there's always gonna be more!

18:21.975 --> 18:23.352
I can't do it!

19:04.143 --> 19:07.563
I don't hear any more gunfire.
We should be safe for a while.

19:09.523 --> 19:11.567
-We can hide here.
-Good.

19:11.650 --> 19:13.277
I hope Chishiya's okay.

19:13.360 --> 19:14.695
And Ann, too.

19:14.778 --> 19:18.615
Oh, I'm sure they're fine.
I mean, they're, like, super smart.

19:18.699 --> 19:19.658
You're right.

19:20.159 --> 19:21.368
If we're staying here,

19:21.869 --> 19:24.288
we'll have to go out
and scavenge some supplies.

19:24.371 --> 19:25.372
Water, food.

19:25.956 --> 19:26.874
Mm-hmm.

19:27.749 --> 19:30.502
Oh man, this sucks. Do we have to, though?

19:31.378 --> 19:34.381
The longer we wait,
the more likely it is that he'll show up.

19:35.174 --> 19:36.925
Let's go find some food.

19:38.010 --> 19:40.470
And I'll… I'll go find us a ride.

19:41.263 --> 19:42.598
Coming with me?

19:42.681 --> 19:43.724
What?

19:43.807 --> 19:45.934
Well, there's a place near here.

19:46.018 --> 19:47.811
Okay, fine.

19:51.440 --> 19:54.568
We won't be long.
You'd better bring back something good.

19:54.651 --> 19:56.069
-We will.
-Here.

19:56.153 --> 19:57.279
Oh, cool.

19:57.362 --> 19:59.781
-Okay, let's go.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:59.865 --> 20:02.367
Let me guess. You've never had
a hot girl on your arm before?

20:02.451 --> 20:04.745
-Come on.
-Sure I have. Shut up!

20:12.628 --> 20:15.172
Okay, this is the spot.
Nice, right?

20:15.255 --> 20:18.217
Yeah, nice.
Lots of old cars. Cool.

20:18.300 --> 20:20.594
Hey!
They're not old, they're classic.

20:20.677 --> 20:21.929
Who cares?

20:27.684 --> 20:29.895
Wait. Are you kidding me?

20:30.562 --> 20:32.940
Holy shit!

20:33.023 --> 20:35.150
Just look at her curves! Oh!

20:35.234 --> 20:37.819
Dude, don't be weird. It's just a car.

20:37.903 --> 20:40.405
Whoa! Have you ever seen
something this hot?

20:40.489 --> 20:42.366
That's so gross.

20:46.745 --> 20:48.830
You know, I realized the other day,

20:48.914 --> 20:51.917
rich people are probably the ones
who are suffering the most now.

20:52.668 --> 20:56.171
Everything they built, that mattered
to them, it's all worthless now.

20:57.256 --> 20:58.465
You're right.

20:59.174 --> 21:00.592
I guess I'm lucky, then.

21:01.093 --> 21:03.262
Don't have to worry about rent anymore.

21:03.804 --> 21:07.266
Yeah, me too. No more credit card
interest payments either.

21:13.063 --> 21:13.897
You know what?

21:17.818 --> 21:20.904
Even with all the bills and payments,
I still want to go home.

21:25.200 --> 21:26.201
Yeah, me too.

21:54.313 --> 21:57.232
YAKISOBA KORE! BAN
SHORTCAKE FLAVOR

22:00.277 --> 22:02.446
Cake-flavored <i>yakisoba?</i>

22:03.196 --> 22:05.615
Oh, it's just like the one
in the commercial!

22:05.699 --> 22:07.951
Oh, yeah!

22:08.035 --> 22:11.163
What are you doing there?
You know how gross those flavors turn out?

22:12.039 --> 22:14.458
Oh, I beg to differ!

22:14.541 --> 22:15.917
Mm.

22:16.001 --> 22:17.169
You're such a virgin.

22:17.753 --> 22:19.296
Yo, that is so uncalled-for.

22:20.380 --> 22:22.257
-Hey, you better eat it all.
-Oh, for sure.

22:22.341 --> 22:23.884
-All of it.
-I won't have any problem.

22:23.967 --> 22:25.344
-You sure?
-None. Arisu will help.

22:25.427 --> 22:26.303
Come on, seriously?

22:37.481 --> 22:39.274
Come on, seriously?

23:00.045 --> 23:01.505
Cash or credit?

23:05.926 --> 23:08.428
That's good.
I haven't heard that in a long time.

23:08.512 --> 23:10.514
Here.

23:15.644 --> 23:16.812
Is this stuff good?

23:17.562 --> 23:19.147
Mm-hmm. I think so.

23:20.107 --> 23:21.191
Hmm.

23:23.819 --> 23:25.362
How many chopsticks would you like?

23:26.321 --> 23:28.281
I'll take four sets, please.

23:28.365 --> 23:29.533
Of course, sir.

23:32.869 --> 23:35.122
Thank you very much,
and I hope you have a wonderful day.

23:35.872 --> 23:38.750
What was-- Your voice went up,
like, a whole octave there.

23:39.334 --> 23:42.129
But it makes you wanna buy more, right?

23:43.171 --> 23:45.841
Yeah, I bet a ton of guys
would have come in for you.

23:45.924 --> 23:47.008
With that smile.

23:47.592 --> 23:49.344
-Huh?
-Huh?

23:52.639 --> 23:54.015
Hey, are you blushing?

23:54.516 --> 23:56.893
No. I'm used to it.

23:57.644 --> 23:58.562
Really?

24:06.736 --> 24:09.448
I always wanted to work
at a convenience store.

24:09.531 --> 24:11.074
-Seriously?
-Mm-hmm.

24:11.908 --> 24:13.994
The barcodes. I like scanning.

24:15.454 --> 24:17.414
You know the ones
who could scan real well?

24:17.497 --> 24:19.249
-I really admired them.
-Ah, yeah.

24:19.332 --> 24:20.500
And here you are, sir.

24:22.836 --> 24:25.630
I can't wait
to get back to our world.

24:28.008 --> 24:30.427
Eating <i>yakisoba, </i>AC on full blast,

24:30.510 --> 24:32.512
sitting with your best friends,

24:33.346 --> 24:35.640
reading all the new manga
when they come out.

24:47.486 --> 24:49.654
Stop doin' that, man.

24:49.738 --> 24:51.781
-Creepy smiling makes me wanna hurl.
-Mmm, mmm.

24:52.449 --> 24:53.617
Yeah, stop.

24:54.618 --> 24:56.953
-Look at this right here. See?
-Huh? Hm.

24:57.037 --> 25:00.207
The look on her face.
Her breasts, are you seeing them?

25:00.290 --> 25:01.500
She's a total ten, bro!

25:01.583 --> 25:05.420
<i>Manga </i>magazines should be
about the <i>manga, </i>not the models.

25:05.504 --> 25:08.215
-That's not true.
-What are you talking about? Let me check.

25:09.966 --> 25:12.177
-You see? She's hot.
-You hearing this?

25:12.260 --> 25:13.470
-Karube.
-What was that?

25:13.553 --> 25:14.554
-Check it out.
-Good stuff.

25:14.638 --> 25:15.805
-What?
-Look, here.

25:15.889 --> 25:16.765
-You see?
-Arisu.

25:17.516 --> 25:20.435
You keep saying stupid shit like this,
you'll catch the virgin.

25:20.519 --> 25:22.062
-Wait, what?
-Oh, no, not the virgin!

25:22.145 --> 25:24.022
-Virgin isn't a disease!
-Oh, no!

25:24.105 --> 25:25.649
-Damn, you've got it now!
-I guess I did.

25:25.732 --> 25:27.192
-Wait! I'm already a virgin!
-Oh shit!

25:27.275 --> 25:29.236
-Oh, now we're teaming up!
-I'm gonna get you…

25:34.574 --> 25:36.826
Man, those were some good times.

25:43.375 --> 25:44.501
Usagi…

25:48.046 --> 25:50.090
We're gonna make it back to our world.

25:59.057 --> 26:00.183
What's wrong?

26:12.904 --> 26:16.575
KENICHIRO SHIBASAKI ATTEMPTS SUICIDE
OVER FALSE ARTICLE

26:18.368 --> 26:19.578
<i>Dad…</i>

26:23.873 --> 26:25.500
Mr. Usagi?

26:25.584 --> 26:27.085
Do you have any comment?

26:29.713 --> 26:33.383
<i>A mountain climber has</i>
<i>gone missing while climbing Mt. Tanigawa</i>

26:33.466 --> 26:35.802
<i>on the border between Gunma and Niigata…</i>

26:35.885 --> 26:36.928
AN OXYGEN TANK WAS USED

26:37.012 --> 26:38.722
"SOLO NO-OXYGEN ASCENT"
WAS IT ALL A HOAX!?

26:38.805 --> 26:40.932
…<i>the man is famed climber</i>
<i>Shigenori Usagi</i>

26:41.016 --> 26:44.060
<i>whose accomplishments include</i>
<i>climbing Mt. Everest and as a guide…</i>

26:44.144 --> 26:46.313
SHIGENORI USAGI:
SUICIDE AFTER SUSPICIONS OF DECEIT?

26:46.396 --> 26:47.564
SUICIDE?

26:47.647 --> 26:49.983
<i>…continue to conduct</i>
<i>ground and air searches,</i>

26:50.066 --> 26:51.985

26:52.068 --> 26:54.321
<i>There are no leads</i>
<i>in the search for Usagi,</i>

26:54.404 --> 26:56.740
<i>who went missing climbing Mt. Tanigawa.</i>

26:56.823 --> 26:58.158
<i>Usagi?</i>

27:02.829 --> 27:04.164
Uh, what is it?

27:09.002 --> 27:10.587
Arisu…

27:13.298 --> 27:15.925
Did you really love your life so much?

27:17.135 --> 27:18.094
Huh?

27:23.016 --> 27:24.684
I lost my dad…

27:28.730 --> 27:30.607
right before all this.

27:36.154 --> 27:37.530
They called him a liar.

27:41.284 --> 27:43.828
They harassed him too,
never left him alone.

27:45.622 --> 27:46.956
He went for a climb.

27:51.961 --> 27:53.421
And he never came back.

27:55.048 --> 27:56.549
That was the last I heard.

28:03.640 --> 28:05.725
But he'd been out so many times.

28:10.188 --> 28:12.565
And it wasn't a tough mountain at all.

28:14.526 --> 28:17.195
It's impossible,
that's what I told myself.

28:19.447 --> 28:20.407
But now…

28:21.991 --> 28:24.244
After living here, I understand.

28:28.581 --> 28:29.749
He hated this world.

28:33.503 --> 28:34.713
And he wanted…

28:38.049 --> 28:40.510
He hoped he could find a different one.

28:44.472 --> 28:46.558
I never thought about that before.

28:52.063 --> 28:53.273
And that's…

28:55.316 --> 28:56.860
That's how I feel, too.

28:59.696 --> 29:01.906
I didn't realize
how much I hated our world.

29:05.326 --> 29:07.579
If we went back, I'd still hate it there.

29:15.962 --> 29:17.547
I'm sorry. I<i>…</i>

29:19.716 --> 29:22.010
Getting back is something
everyone else wants.

29:31.978 --> 29:32.937
Usagi.

29:35.148 --> 29:36.733
I know how you feel.

29:38.526 --> 29:39.402
I do.

29:43.323 --> 29:45.074
I hated so much of my life.

29:45.825 --> 29:47.202
The world was shit.

29:48.787 --> 29:50.163
But now, I don't know.

29:51.456 --> 29:52.624
Since coming here,

29:54.083 --> 29:55.752
I wanna try again.

29:57.796 --> 29:59.631
I wanna be a better person.

30:06.346 --> 30:07.764
I'll protect you.

30:08.431 --> 30:09.849
I'll do whatever it takes.

30:11.976 --> 30:13.436
Let's go back together.

30:26.908 --> 30:28.117
I'm sorry.

30:32.372 --> 30:34.082
Everyone says it, Arisu.

30:35.416 --> 30:37.335
That they know how I feel.

30:38.336 --> 30:41.172
That I should just forget the past
and be happy.

30:47.804 --> 30:50.390
But it's not so easy
to forget.

30:52.934 --> 30:54.060
Even you…

30:56.604 --> 30:59.023
I don't know
what you've been through either.

31:03.653 --> 31:06.906
If someone understands me or not,
it doesn't make a difference.

31:09.576 --> 31:10.577
It's just…

31:14.664 --> 31:17.458
if somebody gave me the chance
to go back there…

31:19.836 --> 31:21.254
to that world…

31:27.635 --> 31:29.554
I really don't think that I would.

31:31.139 --> 31:33.057
Staying here won't change that.

31:33.141 --> 31:34.475
Usagi…

31:47.155 --> 31:48.907
We should go.

31:50.783 --> 31:52.076
Everyone's waiting.

32:29.530 --> 32:32.951
Hey, hey! Arisu! Usagi! Get in!

32:33.826 --> 32:36.955
-We're exposed in this thing.
-It's the only one I could start.

32:37.038 --> 32:39.707
You are such a liar.
I watched you fall in love with it.

32:39.791 --> 32:41.459
It was so gross the way you felt it up.

32:41.542 --> 32:43.795
-Said it was sexy…
-I said I liked its curves.

32:43.878 --> 32:45.505
Dude, that's so gross.

32:45.588 --> 32:48.091
What do you mean, gross?
I like the car.

32:51.135 --> 32:52.178
Get in.

32:57.934 --> 32:59.936
Arisu?

33:00.853 --> 33:01.896
Uh, yeah.

34:06.836 --> 34:09.130
<i>The King of Spades</i>
<i>is getting closer.</i>

34:10.256 --> 34:13.634
It's just like you said.
His arena is the whole city.

34:16.345 --> 34:19.974
That's not good.
We gotta stay ahead of him, keep running.

34:22.643 --> 34:25.313
There's another way
we can stay off his radar.

34:26.064 --> 34:26.939
What's that?

34:28.399 --> 34:30.485
There's other games we can join, right?

34:30.985 --> 34:31.861
Huh?

34:33.946 --> 34:36.074
Put yourself in their shoes for a sec.

34:36.741 --> 34:39.202
I wouldn't want my game interfered with.

34:39.952 --> 34:42.663
So they have some kind of agreement,
is that it?

34:43.915 --> 34:46.167
Don't interfere with each other,
be polite.

34:47.585 --> 34:51.422
Each game so far has had rules.
Very strict rules.

34:52.298 --> 34:54.258
If another game got mixed in,

34:55.093 --> 34:56.844
it would completely ruin it.

34:57.637 --> 34:58.971
But, like…

34:59.722 --> 35:02.058
What if I don't wanna play anymore?

35:02.141 --> 35:06.145
We were forced into
the King of Spades' game, like it or not.

35:06.896 --> 35:08.773
We can keep hiding, sure.

35:08.856 --> 35:11.192
But eventually, he'll find us and kill us,

35:11.275 --> 35:14.028
or our visas will run out,
and then, pyeow!

35:14.654 --> 35:16.447
If we keep playing, though,

35:16.948 --> 35:19.283
we'll be able to get more information.

35:19.367 --> 35:22.120
Find out from the game masters
what this place is.

35:22.662 --> 35:24.497
Or why we're here.

35:26.165 --> 35:27.667
We need more answers.

35:29.794 --> 35:31.629
Or everyone else died for nothing.

35:43.432 --> 35:44.809
Why don't we vote on it?

35:47.186 --> 35:49.021
I'm with Arisu on this.

35:51.607 --> 35:52.733
Oh shit.

35:54.277 --> 35:56.571
All right. Count me in.

35:58.239 --> 35:59.157
Usagi?

36:03.161 --> 36:04.662
It's majority rules.

36:05.329 --> 36:06.622
You have your answer.

36:09.417 --> 36:12.086
So, which game first? What do you think?

36:16.883 --> 36:20.428
The furthest one we can see
is here, along the harbor.

36:21.429 --> 36:22.722
The King of Clubs.

36:23.472 --> 36:26.225
You're picking a King? You're joking?

36:26.309 --> 36:29.395
A King would probably
have more key information.

36:29.478 --> 36:31.898
You've got guts, Arisu.

36:31.981 --> 36:35.651
And besides,
Club games are about teamwork.

36:36.694 --> 36:38.487
So we'll have a chance to win.

36:39.697 --> 36:42.533
-With this group, for sure!
-Ah! Yeah!

36:42.617 --> 36:44.118
I'm not counting you in that.

36:44.619 --> 36:46.162
-Hey!
-Kidding!

38:01.320 --> 38:02.446
What's that?

38:16.085 --> 38:18.045
NO WEAPONS ALLOWED

38:18.754 --> 38:21.090
PARTICIPANTS: FIVE PLAYERS
PLEASE PUT ON BRACELETS AND WAIT

38:21.173 --> 38:22.216
Bracelets?

38:23.718 --> 38:25.845
It says we need five players.

38:26.345 --> 38:27.847
But there's only four.

38:30.391 --> 38:31.851
Five, actually.

38:37.148 --> 38:38.274
Niragi?

38:38.858 --> 38:40.151
It's been a while.

38:43.446 --> 38:44.697
What?

38:45.364 --> 38:46.407
You're still alive?

38:49.076 --> 38:51.537
Team up with him? I don't think so.

38:52.204 --> 38:54.123
He'll sabotage us, for sure.

38:55.833 --> 38:57.960
I bet he's already got
a plan to screw us over.

38:58.044 --> 39:00.296
The bracelet's not comin' off now.

39:02.715 --> 39:04.967
All I wanna do is enjoy the game.

39:06.844 --> 39:08.804
If you're not interested in playin',

39:09.305 --> 39:11.640
you'd better get outta here, huh?

39:16.604 --> 39:17.730
Usagi?

39:18.856 --> 39:20.608
I don't care what he wants.

39:28.032 --> 39:29.867
If we don't join the game,

39:30.576 --> 39:31.827
we'll be gunned down.

39:33.662 --> 39:34.955
And that's it.

39:36.999 --> 39:39.460
I'd rather fight here
than die like an animal.

39:44.965 --> 39:45.883
Me too.

39:50.179 --> 39:51.472
I wanna know why.

40:09.031 --> 40:10.616
You two are idiots.

40:11.826 --> 40:13.494
Don't say I didn't warn you.

40:18.916 --> 40:20.292
Hey, don't slow us down.

40:21.377 --> 40:23.796
This game is about working together.

40:25.798 --> 40:28.551
And I'm pretty sure you're the slow one.

40:36.892 --> 40:39.186
<i>Registration is now closed.</i>

40:39.270 --> 40:41.439
<i>The game will now commence.</i>

41:47.004 --> 41:48.631
What is this place?

41:54.011 --> 41:57.431
<i>The King of Club's team</i>
<i>is now entering the field.</i>

42:19.411 --> 42:20.538
Welcome…

42:22.665 --> 42:24.416
to our game field.

42:26.502 --> 42:28.170
I am the King of Clubs,

42:29.380 --> 42:30.506
Kyuma.

42:40.724 --> 42:42.351
-Uh…
-Uh…

42:45.312 --> 42:48.148
Okay, let me introduce everyone.

42:48.232 --> 42:50.150
First we have Shitara.

42:54.238 --> 42:55.322
Uta.

42:56.782 --> 42:57.741
Maki.

42:59.034 --> 43:00.202
Goken.

43:03.622 --> 43:04.540
Pleasure.

43:08.377 --> 43:10.129
That's all the reaction I get?

43:10.796 --> 43:12.464
I think you're weirding them out.

43:12.548 --> 43:13.966
Put some damn pants on.

43:14.550 --> 43:16.302
What? Not a chance!

43:16.885 --> 43:18.971
Nudism is an upstanding practice.

43:19.054 --> 43:21.724
A social movement
with hundreds of years of history!

43:22.975 --> 43:25.477
Clothing is a social construct.

43:25.561 --> 43:27.730
No biological necessity.

43:28.647 --> 43:31.108
Humans should be bare and raw.

43:31.191 --> 43:33.193
After all, it's only natural.

43:34.486 --> 43:36.405
What's the deal with this guy?

43:37.781 --> 43:39.992
So this is the King of Clubs?

43:40.075 --> 43:41.910
Out of his damn mind.

43:43.287 --> 43:47.374
Listen, we don't care about that.
Just tell us who you are.

43:50.419 --> 43:51.670
Who are we?

43:52.713 --> 43:54.590
We are the citizens of this country.

43:57.551 --> 43:58.719
Citizens?

43:59.219 --> 44:01.305
Sure. Citizens.
