00:13.255 --> 00:14.999
Coming up on it fast, sir.

00:19.845 --> 00:21.422
Are you certain
of your sensor readings?

00:21.597 --> 00:23.673
Definitely a space vessel
of some type.

00:24.182 --> 00:26.175
- Origin?
- Unknown.

00:26.351 --> 00:28.807
It could hardly be an Earth ship.
There have been no flights

00:28.979 --> 00:31.933
- into this sector for years.
- I'm picking up a signal, sir.

00:34.359 --> 00:36.684
Captain, that's the old
Morse code call signal.

00:36.861 --> 00:39.696
- Thank you, lieutenant.
- C-Q. C-Q.

00:39.864 --> 00:41.489
We're reading it, lieutenant.

00:41.657 --> 00:44.742
I thought you said it couldn't
possibly be an Earth vessel.

00:44.952 --> 00:47.953
Fail to understand why it always gives
you pleasure to see me proven wrong.

00:48.539 --> 00:51.456
An emotional
Earth weakness of mine.

00:52.751 --> 00:54.708
There it is.

00:57.714 --> 01:00.668
An old Earth vessel
similar to the DY-500 class.

01:01.134 --> 01:04.918
Much older.
DY-100 class, to be exact.

01:09.643 --> 01:11.053
Captain...

01:11.436 --> 01:15.896
...the last such vessel was built
centuries ago, back in the 1990s.

01:16.065 --> 01:19.351
Then it's a derelict,
its signal left on automatic.

01:19.527 --> 01:22.362
Or an old Earth ship
being used by aliens.

01:23.698 --> 01:26.070
- Weapons status.
- Deflector shields on maximum.

01:26.242 --> 01:28.697
- Phasers manned, sir.
- Bio-scanners report.

01:28.869 --> 01:32.238
Life science bio-scanners are picking
up heartbeats from over there.

01:32.414 --> 01:34.537
Can't be human, though.
They're too faint and average,

01:34.708 --> 01:36.202
only four beats per minute.

01:36.376 --> 01:39.543
Sensor reading, captain. Some sort of
equipment functioning on that vessel.

01:40.422 --> 01:42.082
All decks, go to full alert.

02:09.449 --> 02:12.450
Space, the final frontier.

02:13.537 --> 02:16.822
These are the voyages
of the starship Enterprise.

02:17.290 --> 02:21.370
Its five-year mission:
To explore strange new worlds,

02:22.379 --> 02:25.249
to seek out new life
and new civilizations,

02:26.257 --> 02:29.342
to boldly go
where no man has gone before.

02:59.331 --> 03:02.664
Captain's log, stardate 3141.9.

03:02.834 --> 03:06.417
A full hour has elapsed since
interception of the strange vessel.

03:06.588 --> 03:09.791
Our presence alongside
is still being completely ignored.

03:09.966 --> 03:12.587
Although our sensors continue
to show signs of equipment

03:12.760 --> 03:16.343
and life aboard, there's been
no indication of danger to us.

03:17.014 --> 03:19.505
Weapons Department,
maintain battle stations.

03:19.683 --> 03:22.009
All other decks, stand by alert.

03:24.396 --> 03:26.305
All decks acknowledging, sir.

03:26.857 --> 03:29.395
Continuing to pick up some form
of heart action over there.

03:29.568 --> 03:33.067
Very faint, very slow. Seems to be
coming from about 60 or 70 bodies,

03:33.238 --> 03:35.646
- as near as I can make out.
- Alien bodies, Bones?

03:35.824 --> 03:39.572
Could be. There's no sign of breathing
or any other form of respiration.

03:40.370 --> 03:42.409
Hull surface is pitted
with meteor scars.

03:42.580 --> 03:46.364
However, scanners make out
a name, SS Botany Bay.

03:46.542 --> 03:48.001
Then you can check the registry.

03:48.586 --> 03:50.080
No such vessel listed.

03:50.254 --> 03:53.006
Records of that period
are fragmentary, however.

03:53.257 --> 03:57.718
The mid 1990s was the era
of your last so-called "World War."

04:00.222 --> 04:02.013
The Eugenics Wars.

04:02.725 --> 04:06.343
Of course. Your attempt to improve
the race through selective breeding.

04:07.062 --> 04:09.553
Now, wait a minute,
not our attempt, Mr. Spock,

04:09.731 --> 04:11.938
a group of ambitious scientists.

04:12.484 --> 04:13.943
I'm sure you know the type:

04:14.236 --> 04:16.642
Devoted to logic,
completely unemotional...

04:16.821 --> 04:19.526
- Doctor, I would be pleased...
- All right, gentlemen, as you were.

04:19.699 --> 04:22.272
Rig for tractor beam, helm.
Lock onto that vessel.

04:22.452 --> 04:24.859
- Rigging for tractor beam, sir.
- Bridge is yours, Mr. Spock.

04:25.038 --> 04:26.615
Care to join
the landing party, doctor?

04:26.789 --> 04:28.533
Well, if you're actually
giving me a choice...

04:28.708 --> 04:30.083
I'm not.

04:32.086 --> 04:35.252
Oh, I'll need somebody familiar
with the late 20th-century Earth.

04:35.422 --> 04:37.913
Here's a chance for that historian
to do something for a change.

04:38.092 --> 04:40.665
What's her name? McGivers?

04:41.303 --> 04:42.762
Lieutenant McGivers.

04:47.309 --> 04:51.093
Attention. The following personnel
report to Transporter Room:

04:51.271 --> 04:54.272
Engineering Officer Scott,
Lieutenant McGivers.

04:54.441 --> 04:56.065
Acknowledge.

04:59.279 --> 05:01.318
McGivers, on my way.

05:08.120 --> 05:10.113
It looks like that ship
is expecting us.

05:10.289 --> 05:13.041
We read heat coming on,
complete oxygen atmosphere.

05:13.209 --> 05:14.952
Very interesting.
You ready, Bones?

05:15.127 --> 05:17.748
No. Signed aboard this ship
to practise medicine,

05:17.921 --> 05:21.421
not to have my atoms scattered back
and forth across space by this gadget.

05:21.592 --> 05:23.216
You're an old-fashioned boy,
McCoy.

05:23.385 --> 05:24.879
Where's that historian?

05:26.138 --> 05:28.807
- Well, come on, Lieutenant...
- McGivers, sir.

05:31.476 --> 05:33.303
Energize.

06:00.003 --> 06:01.284
Scotty?

06:01.463 --> 06:03.337
Definitely
Earth-type mechanisms, sir.

06:03.507 --> 06:05.214
Twentieth-century vessel.

06:05.383 --> 06:07.340
Old-type atomic power.

06:08.219 --> 06:10.212
Bulky, solid.

06:10.388 --> 06:13.009
I think they used to call them
"transistor units."

06:13.349 --> 06:15.971
I'd love to tear this baby apart.

06:16.144 --> 06:18.017
Captain, it's a sleeper ship.

06:19.230 --> 06:21.187
Suspended animation?

06:21.440 --> 06:23.018
I've seen old photographs of this.

06:23.192 --> 06:24.651
Necessary because
of the time involved

06:24.819 --> 06:27.440
in space travel
until about the year 2018.

06:27.613 --> 06:30.733
It took years just to travel
from one planet to another.

06:31.992 --> 06:35.657
Is it possible they're still alive...

06:38.623 --> 06:40.415
...after centuries of travel?

06:40.584 --> 06:42.292
Theoretically possible.

06:42.836 --> 06:45.872
I've never heard of it being tested
for this long a period.

06:48.258 --> 06:50.464
What a handsome group of people.

06:51.094 --> 06:53.003
Jim, I have a new reading.

06:53.179 --> 06:54.887
Lights must have triggered
some mechanism.

06:55.056 --> 06:56.550
Captain, look here.

06:59.477 --> 07:01.137
Scotty?

07:01.896 --> 07:03.687
Beats me what's happening.

07:05.733 --> 07:07.227
We've triggered something, all right.

07:07.401 --> 07:10.437
Heartbeat's increasing,
now passing eight beats per minute.

07:11.363 --> 07:13.735
And there are some signs
of respiration beginning.

07:13.907 --> 07:17.572
This one was probably programmed
to be triggered first.

07:18.870 --> 07:20.412
Could he be the leader?

07:23.083 --> 07:25.075
The leader. Lieutenant.

07:26.419 --> 07:29.705
Yes, sir. The leader
was often set to revive first.

07:29.881 --> 07:31.126
This would allow him to decide

07:31.299 --> 07:33.790
whether the conditions
warranted revival of the others.

07:36.053 --> 07:37.761
Heartbeat now approaching
40 per minute.

07:38.514 --> 07:40.970
The respiration pattern is firming up.

07:44.478 --> 07:46.886
From the northern India area,
I'd guess,

07:47.064 --> 07:50.480
probably a Sikh.
They're the most fantastic warriors.

07:50.651 --> 07:53.106
- Heartbeat now 52 and increasing.
- The others?

07:53.278 --> 07:55.603
There's no change.
And they're all mixed types:

07:55.781 --> 07:58.698
Western, mid-European,
Latin, Oriental.

07:59.200 --> 08:02.118
A man from the 20th century
coming alive.

08:02.829 --> 08:04.905
Maybe. Heartbeat dropping.

08:06.124 --> 08:07.499
Circuit shorting.

08:07.667 --> 08:11.285
Probably some dust.
Heartbeat now 30, dropping fast.

08:11.963 --> 08:13.789
There's a heart flutter. He's dying.

08:13.965 --> 08:15.957
- Do something, captain.
- Can we?

08:16.133 --> 08:17.960
Take an hour to figure out.

08:18.469 --> 08:20.011
What happens if we
get him out of there?

08:20.179 --> 08:22.053
He'll die in seconds if we don't.

09:07.516 --> 09:10.967
How long?

09:12.062 --> 09:13.556
How long...

09:13.980 --> 09:15.522
...have you been sleeping?

09:16.358 --> 09:18.350
Two centuries, we estimate.

09:21.112 --> 09:22.606
Landing party to Enterprise.
Come in.

09:22.780 --> 09:25.069
Go ahead, boarding party,
we read you.

09:25.616 --> 09:27.490
Lock in on Dr. McCoy's beam.

09:27.660 --> 09:30.365
He's transporting back
with a casualty we discovered here.

09:30.538 --> 09:32.364
Magnificent.

09:42.216 --> 09:44.291
Captain's log, supplemental.

09:44.885 --> 09:48.051
Alongside the SS Botany Bay
for ten hours now.

09:48.930 --> 09:51.089
A boarding party of engineering
and medical specialists

09:51.266 --> 09:54.682
are now completing their examination
of the mysterious vessel.

09:55.311 --> 09:57.470
Attempts to revive other sleepers

09:57.647 --> 10:02.143
await our success or failure with
the casualty already beamed over.

10:02.318 --> 10:06.896
Dr. McCoy is frankly amazed at
his physical and recuperative power.

10:09.408 --> 10:11.650
- Kirk to boarding party.
- Scott here.

10:11.827 --> 10:15.410
Scotty, any records?
Log books of any kind?

10:15.581 --> 10:18.416
Negative, captain. It appears
they were in suspended animation

10:18.584 --> 10:21.039
- when the ship took off.
- How many alive?

10:21.211 --> 10:24.331
Twelve units have malfunctioned,
leaving 72 still operating.

10:24.506 --> 10:26.582
Thirty of those are women.

10:27.259 --> 10:28.919
Kirk out.

10:30.887 --> 10:32.844
Seventy-two alive.

10:33.389 --> 10:36.509
A group of people dating back
to the 1990s.

10:36.684 --> 10:39.056
A discovery of some importance,
Mr. Spock.

10:39.228 --> 10:41.898
There are a great many unanswered
questions about those years.

10:42.064 --> 10:44.638
A strange, violent period
in your history.

10:45.609 --> 10:48.729
I find no record whatsoever
of an SS Botany Bay.

10:50.030 --> 10:52.237
Captain, the DY-100 class vessel

10:52.408 --> 10:55.278
was designed
for interplanetary travel only.

10:55.452 --> 10:57.112
With simple
nuclear-powered engines,

10:57.287 --> 11:00.371
star travel was considered impractical
at that time.

11:00.540 --> 11:02.082
It was 10,000-1

11:02.250 --> 11:04.955
against their making it
to another star system.

11:05.128 --> 11:06.919
And why no record of the trip?

11:07.756 --> 11:09.463
Botany Bay...

11:10.216 --> 11:14.130
...that was the name of a penal colony
on the shores of Australia, wasn't it?

11:15.179 --> 11:17.505
If they took that name
for their vessel...

11:17.682 --> 11:20.718
If you're suggesting
this was a penal deportation vessel,

11:20.893 --> 11:23.514
you've arrived
at a totally illogical conclusion.

11:25.189 --> 11:27.431
Your Earth was on the verge
of a Dark Ages.

11:27.608 --> 11:30.609
Whole populations were being
bombed out of existence.

11:30.778 --> 11:32.651
A group of criminals could
have been dealt with

11:32.821 --> 11:36.404
far more efficiently than wasting one
of their most advanced spaceships.

11:38.785 --> 11:41.988
Yes. So much for my theory.

11:42.163 --> 11:44.322
I'm still waiting to hear yours.

11:46.376 --> 11:50.456
Even a theory requires some facts,
captain.

11:53.841 --> 11:55.668
So far...

11:56.010 --> 12:00.008
...I have none.
- And that irritates you, Mr. Spock.

12:01.807 --> 12:03.930
- Irritation?
- Yeah.

12:04.560 --> 12:06.766
I am not capable of that emotion.

12:07.688 --> 12:09.846
My apologies, Mr. Spock.

12:11.650 --> 12:13.856
You suspect
some danger in them?

12:14.027 --> 12:17.526
Insufficient facts
always invites danger, captain.

12:18.532 --> 12:20.191
Well, I'd better get some facts.

12:20.367 --> 12:22.359
- Rig for towing.
- Aye, aye, sir.

12:22.535 --> 12:25.322
- Make course for Starbase 12.
- Aye, sir.

12:34.505 --> 12:36.213
That'll be all.

12:46.225 --> 12:48.182
- Bones?
- He'll live.

12:48.727 --> 12:52.427
- My compliments.
- No, I'm good, but not that good.

12:52.898 --> 12:56.516
There's something inside this man
that refuses to accept death.

12:57.068 --> 12:59.144
Now, look at that.
Even as he is now,

12:59.321 --> 13:02.321
his heart valve action
is twice the power of yours or mine.

13:02.824 --> 13:04.900
Lung efficiency, 50 percent better.

13:05.618 --> 13:07.575
An improved breed of human.

13:07.745 --> 13:09.987
That's what the Eugenics War
was all about.

13:10.373 --> 13:12.864
I'd estimate he could lift us both
with one arm.

13:14.418 --> 13:17.123
Be interesting to see
if his brain matches his body.

13:18.756 --> 13:20.748
Doctor, will he live?

13:21.258 --> 13:22.883
Lt appears he will, lieutenant.

13:28.974 --> 13:30.516
I'd like to talk to you.

13:32.727 --> 13:35.681
If I were to rate your performance as
a member of the landing party today...

13:35.855 --> 13:37.563
I know, sir. I'm sorry.

13:37.732 --> 13:41.564
Lieutenant, at any one time, the safety
of this entire vessel might depend

13:41.736 --> 13:43.645
on the performance
of a single crewman aboard.

13:43.821 --> 13:45.565
And the fact that you find a man

13:45.740 --> 13:47.317
strangely compelling
to you personally...

13:47.492 --> 13:49.899
Not personally, captain,
professionally.

13:50.119 --> 13:52.527
My profession is historian,

13:52.705 --> 13:55.575
and to find a specimen
from the past, alive...

13:56.292 --> 13:58.450
I mean, the sheer delight
of examining his mind.

13:58.627 --> 14:01.711
And men were
more adventuresome then.

14:01.880 --> 14:03.624
Bolder, more colourful.

14:04.341 --> 14:08.006
- Yes, sir, I think they were.
- Good.

14:08.553 --> 14:11.554
If I can have honesty,
it's easier to overlook mistakes.

14:11.723 --> 14:14.214
- That's all.
- Yes, sir.

14:18.146 --> 14:20.897
A pity you wasted your life
on command, Jim.

14:21.274 --> 14:23.350
You'd have made a fair psychologist.

14:23.818 --> 14:25.526
Fair?

15:04.690 --> 15:05.971
Sickbay to lab.

15:07.360 --> 15:10.859
- Anything new on those bios?
- They all came out fine, doctor.

15:11.197 --> 15:12.774
Good. McCoy out.

15:47.106 --> 15:50.724
Well, either choke me or cut my throat.
Make up your mind.

15:52.569 --> 15:56.899
English.
I thought I dreamed hearing it.

15:57.866 --> 15:59.277
Where am I?

16:00.702 --> 16:02.410
You're in...

16:06.249 --> 16:11.125
You're in bed holding a knife
at your doctor's throat.

16:11.963 --> 16:14.002
Answer my question.

16:14.215 --> 16:18.165
It would be most effective if you
would cut the carotid artery,

16:18.344 --> 16:20.337
just under the left ear.

16:29.646 --> 16:31.639
I like a brave man.

16:35.110 --> 16:38.111
I was simply trying to avoid
an argument.

16:39.698 --> 16:43.826
You're aboard the United Spaceship
Enterprise. Your vessel is in tow.

16:44.452 --> 16:47.821
I remember a voice.
Did I hear it say...

16:48.289 --> 16:52.121
...I had been sleeping
for two centuries?

16:53.503 --> 16:55.246
That is correct.

16:57.006 --> 17:00.457
Where is your captain?
I have many questions.

17:08.392 --> 17:10.265
- Bridge.
- I have a patient here

17:10.435 --> 17:13.555
- with many questions, captain.
- On my way.

17:25.992 --> 17:29.527
James Kirk,
commanding the starship Enterprise.

17:29.704 --> 17:31.198
I see.

17:32.915 --> 17:34.789
And your name?

17:35.835 --> 17:38.242
I have a few questions first.

17:38.754 --> 17:40.035
What is your heading?

17:41.423 --> 17:46.085
Our heading is Starbase 12, a planet
in the Gamma 400 star system...

17:46.678 --> 17:49.169
...our command base in this sector.

17:49.389 --> 17:51.216
Is that of any use to you?

17:53.769 --> 17:55.393
And...

17:56.229 --> 17:57.854
...my people?

17:58.189 --> 18:01.605
Seventy-two of your life-support
canisters are still functioning.

18:09.700 --> 18:14.196
- You will revive them.
- As soon as we reach Starbase 12.

18:15.331 --> 18:16.955
I see.

18:18.083 --> 18:19.364
And now...

18:22.546 --> 18:24.373
Khan is my name.

18:27.009 --> 18:29.678
- Khan. Nothing else?
- Khan.

18:30.637 --> 18:32.179
What was the exact date
of your liftoff?

18:32.347 --> 18:34.803
We know it was sometime
in the early 1990s, but...

18:34.975 --> 18:38.640
I find myself growing fatigued,
doctor.

18:39.395 --> 18:42.978
May we continue this questioning
at some other time?

18:43.149 --> 18:46.518
The facts I need, Mr. Khan,
will take very little time.

18:46.694 --> 18:48.900
For example,
the nature of your expedition.

18:49.071 --> 18:51.906
Jim, a little later might be better.

18:56.328 --> 18:58.866
Captain, I wonder if I could
have something to read

18:59.039 --> 19:02.206
during my convalescence.
I was once an engineer of sorts.

19:02.376 --> 19:08.628
I would be most interested in studying
the technical manuals on your vessel.

19:09.049 --> 19:13.296
Yes, I understand. You have 200 years
of catching up to do.

19:13.511 --> 19:15.171
Precisely.

19:15.930 --> 19:20.391
They're available to any patient
on the viewing screen.

19:21.352 --> 19:25.397
Dr. McCoy will show you
how to tie into the library tapes.

19:25.565 --> 19:28.933
Thank you, captain.
You are very cooperative.

19:47.502 --> 19:50.918
This Khan is not what I expected
of a 20th-century man.

19:51.089 --> 19:53.710
I note he's making considerable use
of our technical library.

19:53.883 --> 19:55.128
Common courtesy, Mr. Spock.

19:55.301 --> 19:57.377
He's going to spend the rest
of his days in our time.

19:57.553 --> 19:59.427
It's only decent to help him
catch up.

20:01.098 --> 20:02.593
Would you...

20:03.392 --> 20:07.224
...estimate him to be a product
of selected breeding?

20:07.605 --> 20:09.431
There is that possibility, captain.

20:12.776 --> 20:14.568
His age would be correct.

20:15.279 --> 20:17.900
In 1993, a group
of these young supermen

20:18.073 --> 20:21.572
did seize power
simultaneously in over 40 nations.

20:22.619 --> 20:24.777
Well, they were hardly supermen.

20:25.914 --> 20:29.117
They were aggressive, arrogant. They
began to battle among themselves.

20:29.292 --> 20:32.044
Because the scientists
overlooked one fact:

20:32.462 --> 20:36.459
Superior ability
breeds superior ambition.

20:36.966 --> 20:38.626
Interesting, if true.

20:39.302 --> 20:42.801
They created a group of Alexanders,
Napoleons.

20:44.932 --> 20:48.135
I've collected some names
and made some counts.

20:48.852 --> 20:51.557
By my estimate,
there were some 80 or 90

20:51.730 --> 20:56.439
of these young supermen unaccounted
for when they were finally defeated.

21:00.155 --> 21:03.606
That fact isn't in the history texts.

21:04.200 --> 21:07.035
Would you reveal
to war-weary populations

21:07.203 --> 21:10.821
that some 80 Napoleons
might still be alive?

21:17.672 --> 21:21.455
- Ship's historian. Lieutenant...
- Marla McGivers.

21:21.634 --> 21:23.044
Yes.

21:23.219 --> 21:25.923
I am told you participated
in my rebirth.

21:26.221 --> 21:27.846
In a small way.

21:29.349 --> 21:32.516
I've been reading up on starships,
but they have one luxury

21:32.686 --> 21:34.725
not mentioned in the manuals.

21:34.896 --> 21:36.640
I don't understand.

21:39.651 --> 21:40.931
A beautiful woman.

21:44.114 --> 21:47.364
My name is Khan.
Please sit and entertain me.

21:51.788 --> 21:54.788
I'd like some historical information
about your ship.

21:54.957 --> 21:57.744
- Its purpose and...
- And why do you wear your hair

21:57.918 --> 22:00.670
in such an
uncomplimentary fashion?

22:01.672 --> 22:03.463
Lt's comfortable.

22:03.632 --> 22:05.708
But it's not attractive.

22:26.404 --> 22:28.112
There.

22:29.282 --> 22:31.155
Soft.

22:32.660 --> 22:34.403
Natural.

22:35.079 --> 22:38.697
- Simple.
- Mr. Khan, I'm here on business.

22:40.125 --> 22:42.118
You find no pleasure here?

22:42.294 --> 22:45.165
My interest is scientific. Men of...

22:45.339 --> 22:46.916
That is the world of the past.

22:47.090 --> 22:50.625
I'm sure you understand, actually
to talk to a man of your century...

22:50.802 --> 22:52.296
There.

22:54.556 --> 22:56.347
Simple.

22:57.309 --> 22:59.218
Soft.

22:59.602 --> 23:01.262
Please remember.

23:04.357 --> 23:08.485
Perhaps some other time when you
feel more like talking about the past.

23:11.906 --> 23:13.530
I'm glad you came.

23:16.452 --> 23:17.994
Please do it again.

23:30.006 --> 23:31.666
Very impressive.

23:31.841 --> 23:34.463
Are we expecting
a fleet admiral for dinner?

23:34.636 --> 23:38.420
Lieutenant McGivers' idea
to welcome Khan to our century.

23:39.474 --> 23:44.385
Just how strongly
is she attracted to him?

23:44.812 --> 23:47.683
Well, there aren't any regulations
against romance, Jim.

23:48.357 --> 23:51.394
My curiosity is official,
not personal, Bones.

23:52.278 --> 23:57.272
Well, he has a magnetism,
almost electric. You felt it.

23:57.825 --> 24:02.154
And it could overpower McGivers
with her preoccupation with the past.

24:02.329 --> 24:04.156
Thank you.

24:07.584 --> 24:11.498
I hoped you might guide me
to our dinner engagement.

24:13.840 --> 24:15.500
Very good.

24:17.218 --> 24:19.839
- Fine technique.
- It's a gladiator named Flavius.

24:20.013 --> 24:21.672
- He once...
- And you've rearranged

24:21.848 --> 24:23.306
your hair for me.

24:24.976 --> 24:26.553
Excellent.

24:33.192 --> 24:36.027
All bold men from the past.

24:36.487 --> 24:39.156
Richard, Leif Ericson, Napoleon.

24:39.740 --> 24:42.028
A hobby of yours, such men?

24:54.045 --> 24:55.623
I am honoured.

24:57.840 --> 24:59.667
Thank you.

25:00.593 --> 25:02.420
But I caution you...

25:03.220 --> 25:06.221
...such men dare take
what they want.

25:26.368 --> 25:28.111
Forgive my curiosity, Mr. Khan,

25:28.286 --> 25:32.070
but my officers are anxious to know
more about your extraordinary journey.

25:32.248 --> 25:34.917
And how you managed
to keep it out of the history books.

25:35.084 --> 25:37.575
Adventure, captain. Adventure.

25:37.753 --> 25:40.161
There was little else left on Earth.

25:40.339 --> 25:42.664
There was the war to end tyranny.

25:43.426 --> 25:45.667
Many considered that a noble effort.

25:45.845 --> 25:49.759
Tyranny, sir,
or an attempt to unify humanity?

25:49.932 --> 25:51.592
Unify, sir?

25:51.767 --> 25:54.602
Like a team of animals
under one whip?

25:59.107 --> 26:03.021
I know something of those years,
remember.

26:03.611 --> 26:09.116
It was a time of great dreams,
of great aspiration.

26:09.284 --> 26:11.905
Under dozens of petty dictatorships.

26:12.370 --> 26:15.904
One man
would have ruled eventually,

26:16.082 --> 26:20.210
as Rome under Caesar.
Think of its accomplishments.

26:25.299 --> 26:26.793
Then your sympathies were with...

26:26.967 --> 26:29.292
You are an excellent tactician,
captain.

26:29.470 --> 26:32.673
You let your second-in-command
attack...

26:33.056 --> 26:36.140
...while you sit and watch
for weakness.

26:37.144 --> 26:41.521
You have a tendency to express ideas
in military terms, Mr. Khan.

26:45.693 --> 26:47.318
This is a social occasion.

26:50.782 --> 26:55.989
It has been said that social occasions
are only warfare concealed.

26:59.248 --> 27:01.454
Many prefer it more honest,

27:01.625 --> 27:03.333
more open.

27:03.502 --> 27:04.913
You fled. Why, were you afraid?

27:06.171 --> 27:08.378
- I've never been afraid.
- But you left at the very time

27:08.549 --> 27:12.842
- mankind needed courage.
- We offered the world order!

27:14.054 --> 27:15.845
We?

27:21.811 --> 27:24.432
Excellent. Excellent.

27:31.696 --> 27:35.195
But if you will excuse me,
gentlemen and ladies.

27:35.366 --> 27:37.358
I grow fatigued again.

27:38.244 --> 27:41.161
With your permission, captain,
I will return to my quarters.

28:06.395 --> 28:08.721
I wanted to apologise.

28:08.898 --> 28:10.641
They had no right
to treat you that way.

28:10.816 --> 28:15.893
Quite understandable, since I'm
something of a mystery to them.

28:16.530 --> 28:19.864
You're no mystery to me.
I know exactly who you are.

28:23.745 --> 28:25.489
Do you?

28:26.748 --> 28:30.413
Leif Ericson,
Richard the Lion-Hearted, Napoleon.

28:31.711 --> 28:34.416
I don't know if you're going
to like living in our time.

28:35.757 --> 28:38.758
Then I'll have to remould it
to my liking.

28:38.927 --> 28:40.919
- Please don't.
- Go.

28:41.095 --> 28:45.887
Or stay, but do it
because it is what you wish to do.

28:53.899 --> 28:55.607
Well?

28:56.402 --> 28:58.311
I'll stay a little longer.

28:59.279 --> 29:02.648
How many minutes
do you graciously offer?

29:03.200 --> 29:05.821
- I only meant...
- This grows tiresome.

29:05.994 --> 29:08.911
You must now ask to stay.

29:10.457 --> 29:11.832
I'd like to stay.

29:14.794 --> 29:16.075
Please?

29:35.647 --> 29:37.687
Open your heart.

29:39.651 --> 29:42.818
Will you open your heart?

29:43.738 --> 29:45.398
Yes.

29:47.242 --> 29:49.815
I intend to take this ship.

29:50.203 --> 29:52.741
- Do you agree?
- Please don't ask me to...

29:52.914 --> 29:55.535
I need your help.

29:57.919 --> 29:59.792
You won't harm anyone?

29:59.962 --> 30:01.622
- Now you question me?
- No.

30:01.797 --> 30:03.292
Will you assist me?

30:03.466 --> 30:06.217
- Please, Khan, don't ask...
- Leave me, then.

30:08.095 --> 30:09.340
Go, I say.

30:14.017 --> 30:15.298
No.

30:19.314 --> 30:21.057
I promise.

30:23.026 --> 30:25.268
I'll do anything you ask.

30:42.336 --> 30:46.203
Name: Khan,
as we know him today.

30:50.052 --> 30:53.337
Name: Khan Noonien Singh.

30:53.513 --> 30:56.847
From 1992 through 1996,
absolute ruler

30:57.017 --> 31:00.136
of more than a quarter of your world,
from Asia through the Middle East.

31:00.562 --> 31:02.969
The last of the tyrants
to be overthrown.

31:03.148 --> 31:04.974
I must confess, gentlemen,

31:05.150 --> 31:08.269
I've always held a sneaking
admiration for this one.

31:08.444 --> 31:11.564
He was the best of the tyrants,
and the most dangerous.

31:12.740 --> 31:15.196
They were supermen, in a sense.

31:15.368 --> 31:18.404
Stronger, braver, certainly
more ambitious, more daring.

31:18.788 --> 31:22.737
Gentlemen, this romanticism
about a ruthless dictator is...

31:22.917 --> 31:26.083
Mr. Spock, we humans
have a streak of barbarism in us.

31:26.253 --> 31:28.495
Appalling, but there, nevertheless.

31:29.381 --> 31:30.959
There were no massacres
under his rule.

31:31.133 --> 31:35.000
- And as little freedom.
- No wars until he was attacked.

31:35.303 --> 31:37.095
Gentlemen.

31:40.392 --> 31:42.301
Mr. Spock, you misunderstand us.

31:42.477 --> 31:45.478
We can be against him
and admire him, all at the same time.

31:48.441 --> 31:50.149
- Illogical.
- Totally.

31:51.819 --> 31:53.444
This is the captain.

31:53.696 --> 31:57.279
Put a 24-hour security on Mr. Khan's
quarters, effective immediately.

32:12.047 --> 32:14.585
I'm sorry, captain, I was...

32:14.758 --> 32:16.300
...lost in thought.

32:19.596 --> 32:21.173
My door.

32:21.347 --> 32:24.384
Locked from outside,
a guard posted.

32:25.643 --> 32:28.395
Unusual treatment
for Khan Noonien Singh.

32:30.189 --> 32:31.683
Excellent.

32:32.900 --> 32:36.316
You identified me with your
computer system, I imagine?

32:36.487 --> 32:38.314
I'd like those answers now.

32:40.532 --> 32:42.192
First...

32:42.576 --> 32:44.319
...the purpose of your star flight.

32:46.455 --> 32:49.989
A new life,
a chance to build a world.

32:52.002 --> 32:54.872
Other things
I doubt you would understand.

32:55.380 --> 32:56.791
Why?

32:57.674 --> 33:00.212
Because I'm not a product
of controlled genetics?

33:01.302 --> 33:04.386
Captain, although your abilities
intrigue me...

33:05.014 --> 33:09.557
...you are quite honestly inferior.
Mentally, physically.

33:09.727 --> 33:12.348
In fact, I am surprised
how little improvement

33:12.521 --> 33:13.980
there has been in human evolution.

33:14.148 --> 33:17.980
Oh, there has been
technical advancement...

33:19.027 --> 33:22.361
...but how little man himself
has changed.

33:26.076 --> 33:30.405
Yes, it appears we will do well
in your century, captain.

33:33.083 --> 33:34.909
Do you have any other questions?

33:35.251 --> 33:36.793
Thank you.

33:37.545 --> 33:39.170
They've all been answered.

34:19.127 --> 34:20.668
Move away.

34:49.322 --> 34:51.030
Otto.

34:51.741 --> 34:53.650
Joaquin.

34:54.243 --> 34:55.702
The trip is over.

34:55.870 --> 34:59.405
The battle begins again.
Only this time, it's not a world we'll win,

34:59.832 --> 35:01.410
it's a universe.

35:03.002 --> 35:04.496
Kati.

35:09.717 --> 35:13.500
- On course, sir. Warp factor 2.
- Maintain.

35:15.430 --> 35:17.304
- Bridge.
- Captain, security here.

35:17.474 --> 35:19.182
Khan's escaped.

35:20.352 --> 35:22.807
- Sound security alert.
- Security alert, captain.

35:23.188 --> 35:25.726
Communication channels
are jammed, captain.

35:32.488 --> 35:34.232
Turbo elevators inoperative.

35:35.741 --> 35:37.533
Jammed, captain.

35:45.918 --> 35:47.542
Atmospheric controls cut off.

35:54.051 --> 35:56.376
Useless.
They're on override in Engineering.

35:57.471 --> 35:59.214
Engineering.

35:59.389 --> 36:00.848
Scotty, this is the bridge.

36:01.141 --> 36:02.551
Captain!

36:04.602 --> 36:07.556
- What's going on down there?
- He's not able to answer you

36:07.730 --> 36:09.355
at the moment, captain.

36:10.400 --> 36:14.231
Your ship is mine.
I have shut off the life-support system

36:14.403 --> 36:16.230
to your bridge,

36:16.405 --> 36:18.398
jammed up your exit routes.

36:18.574 --> 36:20.697
I am willing to negotiate.

36:23.245 --> 36:25.285
Flood all decks with neural gas.

36:27.416 --> 36:30.666
Impossible.
Intruder control systems inoperative.

36:31.044 --> 36:34.211
Mr. Khan was very thorough
in his study of our tech manuals.

36:37.926 --> 36:39.420
Contact Starbase 12.

36:39.594 --> 36:41.919
All channels are totally jammed,
captain.

36:42.430 --> 36:45.466
Brilliant.
Every contingency anticipated.

36:45.767 --> 36:49.266
Your air should be getting quite thin
by now.

36:49.437 --> 36:52.058
- Do you surrender the bridge?
- Negative.

36:52.231 --> 36:54.437
Academic, captain.

36:54.775 --> 36:58.773
Refuse, and every person
on the bridge will suffocate.

37:08.580 --> 37:13.158
Stardate 3142.8.

37:14.794 --> 37:17.120
They have my ship...

37:17.297 --> 37:20.298
... discarding their
own worthless vessel.

37:22.176 --> 37:25.380
Only moments of air left
on the bridge now.

37:29.100 --> 37:33.512
Commendations recommended
for Lieutenant Uhura,

37:33.687 --> 37:37.519
Technicians First Class
Thule and Harrison...

37:40.986 --> 37:42.979
...Lieutenant Spinelli...

37:46.491 --> 37:48.484
...and of course, Mr. Spock.

37:50.829 --> 37:52.987
I take full responsibility.

37:56.668 --> 37:58.328
I take full...

38:02.715 --> 38:05.502
Nothing ever changes...

38:05.676 --> 38:07.503
...except man.

38:08.429 --> 38:10.884
Your technical accomplishments?

38:11.640 --> 38:16.468
Improve a mechanical device
and you may double productivity.

38:16.645 --> 38:18.887
But improve man...

38:20.524 --> 38:24.272
...and you gain a thousandfold.
I am such a man.

38:25.445 --> 38:27.023
Join me.

38:27.823 --> 38:29.365
I'll treat you well.

38:29.699 --> 38:32.534
I need your training
to operate a vessel this complex.

38:32.702 --> 38:34.742
Where is Captain Kirk?

38:36.664 --> 38:39.701
I see now I made one serious error.

38:42.712 --> 38:44.870
You are
the communications officer.

38:45.047 --> 38:46.707
Engage the viewing screen, please.

39:10.405 --> 39:12.065
No!

39:23.000 --> 39:28.706
I should have realised that
suffocating together on the bridge

39:29.256 --> 39:32.423
would create heroic camaraderie
among you.

39:32.760 --> 39:34.966
But it is quite a different thing
to sit by

39:35.137 --> 39:37.343
and watch it happening
to someone else.

39:37.514 --> 39:39.257
Engage the viewing screen.

39:40.851 --> 39:45.845
I'm sure you recognise your medical
decompression chamber here, doctor.

39:48.191 --> 39:50.896
And the meaning of that indicator.

40:10.921 --> 40:12.581
Your captain will die.

40:23.433 --> 40:25.888
If you join me, Mr. Spock...

40:27.061 --> 40:28.437
...I will save his life.

40:32.400 --> 40:33.942
My vessel was useless.

40:34.110 --> 40:37.479
I need you and yours
to select a colony planet,

40:37.655 --> 40:40.572
one with a population
willing to be led by us.

40:40.741 --> 40:42.817
To be conquered by you.

40:43.327 --> 40:46.079
A starship would make that
most simple, wouldn't it?

40:46.997 --> 40:50.829
Each of you in turn will go in there.

40:52.753 --> 40:55.160
Die while the others watch.

40:56.590 --> 41:00.836
Khan, there's no reason
I must watch this, is there?

41:03.054 --> 41:05.462
But I hoped you would be stronger.

41:12.313 --> 41:16.061
If any one of you joins me,
anyone...

41:18.277 --> 41:19.688
...l'll let him live.

41:24.533 --> 41:26.572
It's so useless!

41:29.579 --> 41:30.990
We've lost the channel.

41:35.544 --> 41:37.536
How do I regain picture?

41:38.004 --> 41:39.997
Lt does not matter.

41:40.548 --> 41:42.422
The captain is dead.

41:46.054 --> 41:49.007
Take Mr. Spock next.

42:03.195 --> 42:06.564
Khan said to watch him very closely.
He may decide to cooperate.

42:41.106 --> 42:43.893
Captain, I saved your life.
Now, please don't kill him.

42:58.957 --> 43:01.245
I'm surprised to see you, captain,
though pleased.

43:01.417 --> 43:03.125
I'm a little pleased myself.

43:03.961 --> 43:05.753
- Situation.
- Khan is holding our staff

43:05.922 --> 43:08.958
in the Briefing Room.
His men have control of the ship.

43:09.133 --> 43:10.960
Our only chance
is the intruder control circuit,

43:11.135 --> 43:12.677
although he's cut it off at the bridge.

43:12.845 --> 43:14.505
There's a relay junction
down the corridor.

43:14.680 --> 43:16.637
Gas all decks but this one.

43:19.935 --> 43:22.687
Armoury, this is Khan. Report.

43:25.982 --> 43:27.560
Rodriguez?

43:28.318 --> 43:29.729
Ling?

43:29.903 --> 43:33.817
McPherson? Anyone?
Report status!

43:53.092 --> 43:54.337
- Where's Khan?
- I don't know.

43:54.510 --> 43:56.502
He got out just as the gas...

43:59.181 --> 44:01.469
- Kirk here.
- Anaesthesia gas in all sections

44:01.641 --> 44:04.215
except Engineering.
Someone just closed that line.

44:08.982 --> 44:10.476
Captain, acknowledge.

44:10.650 --> 44:12.441
Unable to flood Engineering section.

44:12.610 --> 44:14.021
- I suspect...
- This is Scott.

44:14.195 --> 44:16.104
Captain's headed for
the Engineering section.

44:16.280 --> 44:18.024
- I'll follow in case...
- Negative.

44:18.199 --> 44:20.690
We must retake the vessel
while the anaesthesia lasts.

44:20.868 --> 44:24.533
Meet me in the armoury.
I'm blowing it clear first. Spock out.

44:47.852 --> 44:49.761
If I understood your manuals...

44:50.438 --> 44:52.431
...that's an overload in progress.

44:53.232 --> 44:57.562
Your ship flares up
like an exploding sun within minutes.

45:39.652 --> 45:42.522
I have five times your strength.

45:43.572 --> 45:45.280
You're no match for me.

46:11.182 --> 46:15.310
Captain's log, stardate 3143.3.

46:15.978 --> 46:18.434
Control of the Enterprise
has been regained.

46:18.814 --> 46:21.732
I wish my next decisions
were no more difficult.

46:22.484 --> 46:24.691
Khan and his people,

46:24.903 --> 46:28.355
what a waste to put them
in a reorientation centre.

46:29.533 --> 46:32.071
And what do I do about McGivers?

46:32.744 --> 46:35.531
Record tapes engaged
and ready, captain.

46:45.173 --> 46:46.999
This hearing is now in session.

46:49.802 --> 46:52.969
Under the authority vested in me
by Starfleet Command...

46:56.308 --> 46:58.882
...I declare all charges
and specifications

46:59.061 --> 47:00.685
in this matter have been dropped.

47:03.023 --> 47:05.016
Jim, agreed you have the authority...

47:05.192 --> 47:08.726
Mr. Spock, I believe our heading takes
us near the Ceti Alpha star system.

47:08.904 --> 47:12.403
Quite correct, captain.
Planet number five there is habitable,

47:12.574 --> 47:15.195
although a bit savage,
somewhat inhospitable.

47:15.368 --> 47:17.361
But no more than Australia's

47:17.537 --> 47:19.992
Botany Bay colony
was at the beginning.

47:20.540 --> 47:23.576
Those men went on
to tame a continent, Mr. Khan.

47:24.168 --> 47:25.746
Can you tame a world?

47:27.880 --> 47:30.549
Have you ever read Milton, captain?

47:32.218 --> 47:33.760
Yes.

47:35.554 --> 47:37.048
I understand.

47:38.849 --> 47:41.256
Lieutenant Marla McGivers.

47:46.231 --> 47:49.766
Given a choice of court-martial

47:50.068 --> 47:51.895
or accompanying them there...

47:54.572 --> 47:56.399
It will be difficult.

47:56.783 --> 48:01.076
A struggle at first, even to stay alive,
to find food.

48:04.582 --> 48:06.242
I'll go with him, sir.

48:09.462 --> 48:11.121
A superior woman.

48:13.215 --> 48:14.709
I will take her.

48:16.593 --> 48:19.263
And I've gotten something else
I wanted.

48:19.846 --> 48:23.891
A world to win, an empire to build.

48:29.773 --> 48:31.480
This hearing is closed.

48:42.451 --> 48:47.327
It's a shame for a good Scotsman
to admit it, but I'm not up on Milton.

48:49.208 --> 48:51.829
The statement Lucifer made
when he fell into the pit:

48:52.336 --> 48:55.290
"Lt is better to rule in hell
than serve in heaven."

48:58.717 --> 49:02.501
Lt would be interesting, captain,
to return to that world in 100 years...

49:03.638 --> 49:07.885
...and learn what crop had sprung
from the seed you planted today.

49:09.519 --> 49:11.179
Yes, Mr. Spock.

49:12.230 --> 49:13.973
It would indeed.
