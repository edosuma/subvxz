WEBVTT

00:05.773 --> 00:08.542
Male voice:
PREVIOUSLY ON
"IN TREATMENT"...

00:08.642 --> 00:10.344
YOU'RE GONNA GET A CALL
FROM ONE OF YOUR COMPATRIOTS.

00:10.444 --> 00:12.246
HE'S A NAVY DOCTOR
NAMED CONNELL.

00:12.346 --> 00:13.581
HE'S GONNA BE
CHECKING UP ON ME.

00:13.681 --> 00:15.916
CAN YOU IMAGINE YOURSELF
BACK IN AN AIRPLANE

00:16.016 --> 00:17.551
FLYING A MISSION
AFTER WHAT HAPPENED?

00:17.651 --> 00:19.387
IT'S WHAT EVERYBODY WANTS,
MY FATHER INCLUDED.

00:19.487 --> 00:21.822
WELL, YOU KNOW,
HE AND MICHAELA,
THEY'RE UNITED IN EVERYTHING.

00:21.922 --> 00:24.558
YOU'RE PUTTING ME
IN A VERY DIFFICULT
POSITION, ALEX.

00:24.658 --> 00:26.527
YOU DON'T EXPECT ME
TO LIE, DO YOU?

00:26.627 --> 00:29.163
PAUL, LOOK--
HEY, CUT THE CRAP!
I NEED THIS.

00:29.263 --> 00:32.233
TELL ME,
WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

00:32.333 --> 00:34.001
I WOULD STAY
IN THERAPY.

00:34.102 --> 00:35.536
I WOULD CONTINUE TO DEAL

00:35.636 --> 00:37.805
WITH THE DIFFICULT ISSUES
THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT,

00:37.905 --> 00:39.173
NOT SWEEP THEM
UNDER THE CARPET

00:39.273 --> 00:40.808
LIKE YOU'VE BEEN DOING
IN YOUR LIFE.

00:40.908 --> 00:42.810
THEY WILL CREEP UP
ON YOU AGAIN.

00:42.910 --> 00:45.413
BUT YOU WON'T TELL ME
NOT TO FLY.

00:49.850 --> 00:52.486
( birds chirping )

00:52.586 --> 00:55.089
( bell pealing )

01:46.374 --> 01:49.210
- HI.
- YOU'LL WANT TO WAIT
TILL THE NEXT HYMN.

01:49.310 --> 01:51.145
THE SERVICE HAS
ALREADY STARTED.

01:51.245 --> 01:54.482
- BUT THEY SAID 10:00.
- FOR THE GARRITY FUNERAL?

01:54.582 --> 01:56.384
- THE PRINCE FUNERAL.
- OH, SORRY.

01:56.484 --> 01:58.286
THAT'S IN THE GOLD CHAPEL.

01:59.220 --> 02:01.455
( whispers )
OKAY. THANK YOU.

03:22.169 --> 03:24.672
( theme music playing )

03:42.155 --> 03:44.858
( hymn playing )

04:33.106 --> 04:37.277
( whispering )
I'M PAUL WESTON.
I WAS A FRIEND OF ALEX'S.

04:37.378 --> 04:42.082
- MY CONDOLENCES.
- THANK YOU FOR COMING.

04:42.182 --> 04:45.753
- I'M DEEPLY SORRY.
- THANK YOU. THANK YOU
VERY MUCH.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.856
I'M DEEPLY SORRY.

05:55.122 --> 05:57.458
SHIT.

05:57.558 --> 05:59.493
THAT'S OKAY.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

05:59.593 --> 06:01.795
IT WILL DRY OFF
IN A MINUTE.

06:02.830 --> 06:04.565
HI, I'M PAUL.

06:05.198 --> 06:06.133
ROY.

06:06.233 --> 06:08.301
I WAS A FRIEND
OF YOUR DAD'S.

06:08.402 --> 06:11.739
HE WAS REALLY PROUD OF YOU.
HE USED TO TALK ABOUT
YOU ALL THE TIME.

06:14.041 --> 06:16.844
HE WOULD BE MAD
TO KNOW I CUSSED JUST NOW.

06:20.981 --> 06:23.116
YOU KNOW, TODAY I THINK
IT WOULD BE OKAY

06:23.216 --> 06:26.019
TO SAY ANY CUSS WORD
YOU WANTED.

06:27.721 --> 06:29.156
YEAH.

06:30.357 --> 06:33.126
MM-HMM.
I'M SAYING THEM...

06:33.226 --> 06:34.828
IN MY HEAD,

06:34.928 --> 06:36.630
WITHOUT SAYING THEM
OUT LOUD,

06:36.730 --> 06:40.400
'CAUSE OF WHAT
I FEEL ABOUT WHAT
HAPPENED TO YOUR DAD.

06:44.838 --> 06:47.608
DO YOU THINK SWEARING
IS BETTER THAN CRYING?

06:49.242 --> 06:50.978
UM...

06:52.345 --> 06:54.615
I THINK
CRYING'S OKAY TOO.

06:55.583 --> 06:57.317
I DON'T WANT TO.

06:57.417 --> 07:00.387
THAT WOULD JUST MAKE
EVERYONE MORE UPSET.

07:00.488 --> 07:03.323
YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO BE STRONG.

07:03.423 --> 07:05.325
MY DAD WAS
ALWAYS TELLING ME

07:05.425 --> 07:07.127
I NEEDED TO BE STRONG.

07:07.227 --> 07:09.162
OH.

07:09.262 --> 07:10.330
WHENEVER HE'D GO AWAY,

07:10.430 --> 07:13.300
HE'D SAY TO ME,
"TAKE CARE OF MOM.

07:13.400 --> 07:15.402
YOU'RE THE MAN
OF THE HOUSE."

07:15.503 --> 07:18.405
YEAH, I KINDA KNOW
WHAT HE MEANS.

07:18.506 --> 07:20.708
BUT, YOU KNOW,
BEING THE MAN OF THE HOUSE

07:20.808 --> 07:23.477
ALSO MEANS LETTING
OTHER PEOPLE KNOW
HOW YOU FEEL INSIDE.

07:23.577 --> 07:25.879
YOU KNOW, WHETHER YOU'RE
ANGRY OR SAD.

07:25.979 --> 07:28.849
THE CHANCES ARE
YOUR MOM FEELS THE SAME.

07:28.949 --> 07:32.920
AND MAYBE THE TWO
OF YOU COULD HELP
EACH OTHER FEEL BETTER.

07:36.356 --> 07:39.527
YOUR DAD TOLD ME THAT
YOU WERE AN INCREDIBLE
CHESS PLAYER.

07:39.627 --> 07:41.428
DID YOU LEAVE
THE KING AND THE ROOK

07:41.529 --> 07:43.697
WITH YOUR FATHER
ON THE CASKET?

07:45.398 --> 07:49.136
THERE'S THIS MOVE
CALLED CASTLING.
DO YOU KNOW IT?

07:49.236 --> 07:50.804
KIND OF, YES.

07:50.904 --> 07:52.706
IT WAS MY DAD'S
FAVORITE MOVE.

07:52.806 --> 07:55.509
- OH.
- HE SWAPPED THEM SOMETIMES.

07:55.609 --> 07:58.078
YOU SACRIFICE YOUR ROOK
TO SAVE YOUR KING.

07:58.178 --> 08:00.080
HMM.

08:00.180 --> 08:02.049
ROY.

08:04.885 --> 08:07.487
- GOODBYE.
- OKAY. YEAH, GOODBYE.

08:29.076 --> 08:30.644
HI.

08:30.744 --> 08:33.747
THANKS FOR CALLING ME.

08:35.048 --> 08:36.449
SURE.

08:36.550 --> 08:39.787
WELL, I WANTED
TO REACH YOU

08:39.887 --> 08:43.824
BEFORE YOU READ ABOUT IT
OR SAW IT ON THE NEWS.

08:44.792 --> 08:46.860
ARE YOU OKAY?
YOU LOOK--

08:46.960 --> 08:49.129
HAVE YOU SLEPT?

08:49.229 --> 08:50.998
UH, NOT REALLY.

08:52.299 --> 08:54.434
SOMETIMES I THINK
IT'S BETTER NOT TO, YOU KNOW?

08:54.534 --> 08:56.436
I KEEP DREAMING
ABOUT THIS.

08:56.536 --> 08:58.639
MMM.

08:58.739 --> 09:02.142
I NEVER HAD A PATIENT
DIE BEFORE IN TREATMENT.

09:02.242 --> 09:05.545
YOU'D THINK IN 20 YEARS
IT WOULD'VE HAPPENED BEFORE,

09:06.179 --> 09:07.581
BUT... IT HASN'T.

09:08.882 --> 09:12.019
YOU SHOULD TAKE
SOME TIME OFF.

09:12.119 --> 09:13.987
WELL, I'M DEFINITELY
GONNA TAKE THE MORNING OFF.

09:14.087 --> 09:16.389
I HAVE TO KEEP
MY AFTERNOON APPOINTMENTS.

09:16.489 --> 09:18.191
NO, YOU SHOULDN'T
DO THAT, PAUL.

09:18.291 --> 09:21.962
I KNOW,
BUT I'VE PROMISED, SO...

09:24.998 --> 09:26.867
ALSO, I--

09:26.967 --> 09:30.070
I ALSO DON'T
JUST WANT TO SIT THERE
AND NOT GIVE ANYTHING BACK.

09:30.170 --> 09:32.339
NO, YOU NEED TO CANCEL
FOR YOUR SAKE, PAUL.

09:34.274 --> 09:37.310
YEAH.
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

09:41.148 --> 09:44.618
- WAS THAT HIS SON?
- HE SEEMS TO BE DOING OKAY.

09:44.718 --> 09:46.553
I WAS, UH--

09:46.654 --> 09:48.856
I WAS TALKING
TO HIM EARLIER ON.

09:50.290 --> 09:52.660
WHAT THE HELL DO YOU SAY
TO A NINE-YEAR-OLD KID

09:52.760 --> 09:55.228
WHOSE FATHER IS...

09:55.328 --> 09:57.698
NOT COMING HOME?

10:00.400 --> 10:03.070
IT'S HARD
TO SEE SO MANY PEOPLE
IN PAIN, YOU KNOW,

10:03.170 --> 10:06.406
AND NOT BE ABLE TO
HELP THEM IN SOME WAY.

10:06.506 --> 10:10.077
WELL, MAYBE HELPING IS
EASIER THAN FEELING THE PAIN.

10:10.744 --> 10:12.880
- TRUE...
- MMM.

10:12.980 --> 10:16.784
- ...DR. LAURA.
- ( both chuckling )

10:18.218 --> 10:20.721
YOU KNOW, MY MOTHER IS
BURIED IN THIS CEMETERY.

10:20.821 --> 10:23.523
- OH, I DIDN'T KNOW SHE--
- MMM.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.759
- WHEN DID SHE DIE?
- OH, A LONG TIME AGO.

10:25.859 --> 10:28.996
- 18 YEARS.
- DO YOU VISIT HER OFTEN?

10:29.096 --> 10:33.801
WELL, YOU SEE,
WE NAMED OUR DAUGHTER

10:33.901 --> 10:36.169
AFTER MY MOTHER--
ROSEMARY--

10:36.269 --> 10:39.973
SO IT'S MY DAUGHTER'S NAME

10:40.073 --> 10:42.542
ON THE GRAVESTONE
IN A WAY.

10:42.642 --> 10:45.779
I CAN'T BEAR THAT,
SO NO, I DON'T--

10:45.879 --> 10:48.782
I DON'T VISIT OFTEN, NO.

10:48.882 --> 10:51.584
ACTUALLY, I AGONIZED WHETHER
OR NOT I SHOULD COME TODAY.

10:51.685 --> 10:54.021
- HMM?
- I DIDN'T WANT
TO BE DISRESPECTFUL.

10:54.121 --> 10:57.290
WHY WOULD YOU BE
DISRESPECTFUL?

10:57.390 --> 10:59.693
WELL, TO HER, HIS WIFE.

11:00.761 --> 11:02.029
I MEAN,
SHE LOST HER HUSBAND,

11:02.129 --> 11:03.697
HER CHILDREN
LOST THEIR FATHER.

11:03.797 --> 11:06.466
THAT'S SOMETHING MEANINGFUL.
I MEAN, WHAT AM I?

11:06.566 --> 11:09.302
A WHAT,
AN EX-FLING?

11:09.402 --> 11:12.873
I THINK IT'S REALLY GREAT
THAT YOU CAME TODAY.

11:15.075 --> 11:18.011
THE TRUTH IS
HE WAS A NICE GUY.

11:18.111 --> 11:21.982
YEAH, HE WAS FUNNY
AND SWEET AND BEAUTIFUL.

11:22.082 --> 11:24.617
I MEAN, IF OUR TIMING
HAD BEEN DIFFERENT

11:24.718 --> 11:26.319
OR IF WE HADN'T MET
THROUGH YOU

11:26.419 --> 11:29.356
OR IF I HAD BEEN
AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT
PERSON, MAYBE...

11:30.791 --> 11:33.093
WELL, BIG IFS.

11:33.193 --> 11:35.829
BIG IFS. MMM.

11:39.199 --> 11:41.969
HMM. IF.

11:56.016 --> 11:57.985
I'M SORRY, DID YOU GET
ONE OF THESE?

11:58.085 --> 12:00.187
- NO.
- DIRECTIONS TO THE GRAVESITE.

12:00.287 --> 12:02.890
IT'S A HUGE CEMETERY,
A BIT OF A LABYRINTH.

12:02.990 --> 12:04.691
OH. OKAY.
THANK YOU.

12:04.792 --> 12:07.828
- DR. WESTON?
- YES.

12:07.928 --> 12:09.696
- I'M DANIEL ALTERIO.
- OH.

12:09.797 --> 12:11.731
I CALLED YOU THE OTHER DAY
WITH THE NEWS.

12:11.832 --> 12:13.801
IT'S NICE
TO MEET YOU.
THANK YOU.

12:13.901 --> 12:17.004
I RECOGNIZED YOUR VOICE.
I HOPE I WASN'T TOO ABRUPT
ON THE PHONE.

12:17.104 --> 12:19.606
I HAD A LONG LIST
OF PEOPLE TO CALL

12:19.706 --> 12:21.674
AND I WAS
STILL REELING MYSELF.

12:21.775 --> 12:23.643
I UNDERSTAND.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.913
MAYBE YOU'RE THE PERSON
WHO CAN EXPLAIN TO ME

12:26.013 --> 12:29.016
WHY ALMOST EVERY PERSON
THAT I GAVE THE NEWS TO,

12:29.116 --> 12:33.320
THEIR FIRST RESPONSE WAS
"BUT I JUST SAW HIM."

12:33.420 --> 12:35.255
WELL, MAYBE THIS IS JUST...

12:35.355 --> 12:38.458
THEIR MIND'S WAY
OF PROCESSING THE SHOCK.

12:40.861 --> 12:42.729
- I'M SORRY. DANIEL.
- LAURA.

12:42.830 --> 12:44.764
- HELLO.
- HI.

12:45.698 --> 12:47.200
SO HAD YOU
JUST SEEN HIM?

12:47.300 --> 12:49.837
NO. NO, HE WAS
STAYING WITH ME,

12:49.937 --> 12:53.306
BUT WE'D BOTH BEEN
SO BUSY.

12:53.406 --> 12:56.209
I TRIED TO GET HIM
TO GO TO THE OPERA
WITH ME THE OTHER NIGHT--

12:56.309 --> 12:58.311
SEAN OFFERED ALEX
HIS TICKET--

12:58.411 --> 13:02.015
BUT OUR ALEX WASN'T
THE OPERA KIND OF GUY.

13:03.183 --> 13:04.852
HE WAS AFRAID OF OPERA.

13:04.952 --> 13:06.553
- I'M AFRAID OF FLYING.
- ME TOO.

13:06.653 --> 13:08.555
- REALLY?
- TERRIFIED.
THANK GOD FOR DRUGS.

13:08.655 --> 13:11.024
AMEN.

13:11.124 --> 13:13.093
ALEX WAS ALWAYS TRYING
TO GET ME TO FLY WITH HIM.

13:13.193 --> 13:16.429
PROMISED IF HE TOOK ME UP,
I'D BE SAFE.

13:16.529 --> 13:18.298
I'M SURE THAT'S TRUE.

13:19.833 --> 13:22.669
YEAH.

13:22.769 --> 13:25.305
I JUST NEVER
THOUGHT IT WOULD END
LIKE THIS FOR HIM.

13:26.239 --> 13:29.376
I MEAN,
I KNEW THE RISKS,

13:29.476 --> 13:32.946
BUT I JUST NEVER THOUGHT
HE'D GET INTO TROUBLE UP THERE.

13:33.046 --> 13:34.982
THEN AGAIN, EVERYTHING
I EVER THOUGHT OF ALEX

13:35.082 --> 13:37.184
GOT TURNED ON ITS HEAD
SOONER OR LATER.

13:37.284 --> 13:39.586
BUT LOOK WHO I'M TELLING--
THE AUTHORITY.

13:39.686 --> 13:41.488
IT WAS GOOD TO MEET YOU.

13:41.588 --> 13:44.257
- YOU TOO, DANIEL.
- UH, I'M SORRY.
LAURIE WAS IT?

13:44.357 --> 13:47.594
- NO, LAURA.
NICE TO MEET YOU.
- NICE TO MEET YOU TOO.

13:47.694 --> 13:50.964
- I'LL SEE YOU BOTH
IN ABOUT A HALF HOUR.
- OKAY. THANK YOU.

13:52.599 --> 13:54.401
ARE YOU OKAY?

13:54.501 --> 13:57.104
YEAH. ARE YOU?

13:57.204 --> 14:00.440
YEAH. AND IF YOU WEREN'T,
WOULD YOU SAY ANYTHING TO ME?

14:00.540 --> 14:03.076
- I WOULD.
- COOL.

14:03.176 --> 14:06.113
EXCUSE ME.
DO I KNOW YOU?

14:06.213 --> 14:09.582
OH, I'M-- I'M PAUL WESTON.
I WAS A FRIEND OF ALEX'S.

14:09.682 --> 14:11.751
MY DEEPEST
DEEPEST CONDOLENCES.

14:11.851 --> 14:13.786
THANK YOU.
I DON'T REMEMBER--

14:13.887 --> 14:15.956
YOU PLAYED RACQUETBALL
WITH HIM.

14:16.056 --> 14:18.591
NO NO NO NO,
THAT WAS A WALTON.

14:18.691 --> 14:20.894
SORRY, THAT WAS
SOMEBODY-- WALTON.

14:20.994 --> 14:23.663
ALEX, YOU KNOW,
HE HAD SO MANY FRIENDS

14:23.763 --> 14:26.099
I NEVER MET...
UNTIL NOW.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.403
IT'S A TERRIBLE THING,
YOU KNOW,

14:30.503 --> 14:33.273
HAVING TO PICK OUT
A PLOT FOR YOUR CHILD.

14:35.675 --> 14:37.344
MICHAELA, SHE, UH...

14:37.444 --> 14:38.979
SHE LEFT IT TO ME.

14:39.079 --> 14:41.114
ALEX, HE LIKED
TO LAY IN THE SUN.

14:41.214 --> 14:44.784
HE WOULD LAY ON THE ROOF
LIKE A LIZARD.

14:44.884 --> 14:47.620
ANY-- ANYWAY, UH,

14:47.720 --> 14:50.090
I PICKED A SPOT THAT'S

14:50.190 --> 14:52.225
REALLY OUT IN THE OPEN,
YOU KNOW, RIGHT--

14:52.325 --> 14:54.928
YOU'LL SEE IT.
YOU'LL SEE IT WHEN
YOU GET THERE, OKAY?

14:55.028 --> 14:56.496
I DIDN'T GET
A CHANCE TO SAY IT
TO YOU BEFORE, SIR,

14:56.596 --> 14:58.398
- BUT YOU HAVE
MY DEEPEST SYMPATHY.
- THANK YOU.

14:58.498 --> 15:00.833
THANK YOU
VERY MUCH FOR COMING,
YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND.

15:00.934 --> 15:03.636
YOU'RE A VERY LUCKY MAN.
YOU HAVE A LOVELY WIFE.

15:03.736 --> 15:06.039
ACTUALLY,
LAURA AND I...

15:07.307 --> 15:09.642
- NO NO NO NO.
- I'M SORRY, I...

15:11.011 --> 15:12.679
I'M JUST ALL
OUT OF SORTS TODAY.

15:12.779 --> 15:14.381
Paul:
I UNDERSTAND.

15:38.538 --> 15:41.241
( breathes deeply )

15:41.341 --> 15:44.044
IT'S SO QUIET.

15:47.380 --> 15:49.249
WHEN I WAS
A LITTLE GIRL...

15:50.417 --> 15:53.720
I'D MAKE MY MOTHER
TIE MY SHOES SO TIGHT

15:53.820 --> 15:57.090
THAT SOMETIMES
THE LACES WOULD SNAP.

16:00.060 --> 16:02.862
AND I LIKED THE BED SHEETS
PULLED REALLY TAUT

16:02.962 --> 16:05.065
SO THAT IT WAS HARD
TO TURN OVER.

16:06.399 --> 16:08.968
I LIKED THE FEELING
OF SOMETHING HOLDING ME IN.

16:10.370 --> 16:12.539
I THINK I WAS AFRAID
THAT MAYBE I'D FLOAT AWAY

16:12.639 --> 16:14.374
AND NO ONE WOULD NOTICE.

16:23.016 --> 16:24.884
SORRY ABOUT THAT BEFORE.

16:24.984 --> 16:26.653
I SHOULD'VE INTRODUCED
YOU PROPERLY.

16:26.753 --> 16:28.388
OH, IT'S OKAY.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.557
IT KIND OF
CAUGHT ME ON THE HOP.

16:30.657 --> 16:32.359
PAUL, IT'S FINE.

16:33.860 --> 16:35.428
WHEN I WAS GROWING UP,

16:35.528 --> 16:38.531
PEOPLE ALWAYS THOUGHT
MY STEPMOTHER WAS MY--

16:38.631 --> 16:40.767
WAS MY SISTER.

16:40.867 --> 16:43.403
SHE WAS...

16:43.503 --> 16:49.276
26 YEARS YOUNGER
THAN MY FATHER.

16:49.376 --> 16:51.478
A FEW TIMES, ACTUALLY,
SHE AND I WERE MISTAKEN

16:51.578 --> 16:54.114
FOR A COUPLE.

16:55.282 --> 16:57.284
AND THE OLD MAN
WOULD PLAY INTO IT,

16:57.384 --> 17:00.220
AS IF SHE AND I WERE
A PAIR OF NEWLYWEDS

17:00.320 --> 17:04.424
TAKING THE OLD MAN OUT
FOR A NIGHT ON THE TOWN.

17:04.524 --> 17:06.659
GOD, HE LOVED IT SO MUCH,
BEING WITH HER,

17:06.759 --> 17:08.495
BECAUSE SHE WAS SO...

17:09.896 --> 17:11.998
YOU KNOW,
YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL.

17:12.099 --> 17:14.667
SO PROUD
OF THE FACT THAT...

17:15.735 --> 17:17.370
SHE WAS WITH HIM.

17:22.142 --> 17:23.710
HOW DID THEY MEET?

17:24.611 --> 17:26.613
HE WAS A DOCTOR

17:26.713 --> 17:29.282
AND-- A HEART SURGEON.

17:30.883 --> 17:33.286
SHE WAS A PATIENT

17:33.386 --> 17:35.688
AND DID A BYPASS ON HER.

17:35.788 --> 17:38.791
THEY STARTED TO DATE
AND THEN HE LEFT MY MOTHER.

17:40.260 --> 17:41.828
THAT WAS A NIGHTMARE.

17:46.133 --> 17:47.334
HMM. WHEN I WAS
A TEENAGER

17:47.434 --> 17:50.170
I WAS ALWAYS--
ALWAYS IN TROUBLE.

17:51.304 --> 17:52.972
I REMEMBER ONCE
THIS COUNSELOR SAID TO ME,

17:53.072 --> 17:54.307
"WHAT ARE YOU GOING
TO BE WHEN YOU GROW UP?"

17:54.407 --> 17:55.942
AND I REMEMBER
SAYING TO HIM,

17:56.042 --> 17:59.346
"ANYTHING
EXCEPT MY FATHER."

18:08.555 --> 18:11.658
MY FATHER WAS
A REALLY SELFISH MAN.

18:13.560 --> 18:15.862
WHATEVER HE WANTED,
HE JUST TOOK IT.

18:17.330 --> 18:19.766
NO REGARD
FOR ANYBODY'S...

18:21.134 --> 18:23.403
FEELINGS OR...

18:27.740 --> 18:29.576
HMM.

18:36.082 --> 18:38.451
( sighs )

18:57.470 --> 19:00.006
I, UH-- I THINK
YOU SHOULD GO WITHOUT ME.

19:00.106 --> 19:02.275
- WHAT?
- NO, IT'S--

19:02.375 --> 19:06.012
I DON'T KNOW.
I JUST DON'T FEEL UP TO IT.

19:06.112 --> 19:08.715
EVERYTHING'S
CAUGHT UP WITH ME,

19:08.815 --> 19:12.785
AND WATCHING THEM
PUT HIM IN THE GROUND IS
A LITTLE TOO MUCH FOR ME.

19:13.986 --> 19:15.622
- YOU SURE?
- YEAH, YOU GO.

19:15.722 --> 19:17.390
PAY YOUR RESPECTS.

19:19.326 --> 19:21.361
NO ONE KNOWS
WHO I AM, ANYWAY.

19:21.461 --> 19:23.129
HEY.

19:23.230 --> 19:24.831
I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

19:34.607 --> 19:36.343
( sighs )

19:43.883 --> 19:46.253
( theme music playing )
