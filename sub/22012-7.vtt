WEBVTT

00:00.968 --> 00:02.203
ADULT ADAM: Ah, the '80s.

00:02.270 --> 00:04.305
Back then,
the economy was booming.

00:04.372 --> 00:05.573
Everyone wanted a piece of it.

00:05.639 --> 00:07.141
The clothes
were loud and shiny.

00:07.208 --> 00:08.742
The phones
were big and silly.

00:08.809 --> 00:11.245
And the movie that best
captured all that decadence

00:11.312 --> 00:13.181
was Wall Street.
(HORN HONKS)

00:13.247 --> 00:15.249
It was a tale of rich guys
getting richer,

00:15.316 --> 00:17.851
and no one loved it
more than my Uncle Marvin.

00:17.918 --> 00:20.654
He made it his life mission
to teach us
his favorite motto,

00:20.721 --> 00:22.156
"Greed is good".

00:22.223 --> 00:24.192
That's right. Cadillac.

00:24.258 --> 00:26.794
The "Cadillac of Cars".
Whoa!

00:26.860 --> 00:28.196
I'm a real stock broker now

00:28.262 --> 00:29.763
inspired
by the loveable character

00:29.830 --> 00:32.200
that Michael Douglas plays
in the movie Wall Street.

00:32.266 --> 00:33.934
Check out my shoulder pads.
Feel that power.

00:34.001 --> 00:35.069
Wow.
Do you like that?

00:35.136 --> 00:36.537
So soft,
but so commanding.

00:36.604 --> 00:38.172
I can set you up
with my shoulder pad guy.

00:38.239 --> 00:40.074
My shoulders have always been
my problem area.

00:40.141 --> 00:41.509
Then let me teach you
the secrets

00:41.575 --> 00:44.044
of becoming a rich
Wall Street titan.

00:44.112 --> 00:47.315
No, no, no.
Do not listen to him.

00:47.381 --> 00:48.616
You don't even know
what we're talking about!

00:48.682 --> 00:49.917
Oh, let me guess.

00:49.983 --> 00:52.820
Cutting corners and stupid
get-rich-quick schemes.

00:52.886 --> 00:54.088
Wrong!

00:54.155 --> 00:55.289
We're talking about
cutting corners

00:55.356 --> 00:57.458
and smart
get-rich-quick schemes.

00:57.525 --> 01:01.562
Barry, whatever this
moron says, do the opposite.

01:01.629 --> 01:03.364
(SCOFFS) You really
going to do the opposite

01:03.431 --> 01:06.300
of the guy who has a toe ring
on every single toe?

01:06.367 --> 01:07.601
Doesn't matter.

01:07.668 --> 01:09.470
My dad'll never let me
play the stocks.

01:09.537 --> 01:11.439
I already promised him
I'd become a stupid doctor

01:11.505 --> 01:13.107
so I could help save
people's stupid lives.

01:13.174 --> 01:17.845
Please. You want
tacky wood paneling
or classy gold spray paint?

01:17.911 --> 01:20.114
But Murray says
becoming a doctor

01:20.181 --> 01:21.415
is the smartest decision
of my life.

01:21.482 --> 01:22.783
You sound crazy
right now.

01:22.850 --> 01:24.785
It takes eight years
to become a doctor.

01:24.852 --> 01:26.854
I can make that
kind of cheddar
in eight seconds.

01:26.920 --> 01:28.489
That sounds right.

01:28.556 --> 01:30.023
Everything sounds right with
your hair slicked back, baby.

01:30.090 --> 01:32.760
Screw medicine!
Screw it!

01:32.826 --> 01:34.295
I hereby renounce my dreams

01:34.362 --> 01:36.530
for whatever it is
that got you that suit.

01:36.597 --> 01:39.367
Exactly! What has medicine
ever done for anybody?

01:39.433 --> 01:42.102
You, my son,
are ready for these.

01:42.170 --> 01:43.737
(CHUCKLES)

01:43.804 --> 01:44.872
How do I look?

01:44.938 --> 01:46.340
Rich.
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

01:46.407 --> 01:47.875
And a little crazy,
I'm not going to lie.

01:47.941 --> 01:49.743
Cuckoo!

01:49.810 --> 01:51.179
* I'm twisted up inside

01:51.245 --> 01:55.183
* But nonetheless
I feel the need to say

01:57.151 --> 01:58.652
* I don't know the future

01:58.719 --> 02:02.823
* But the past keeps getting
clearer every day *

02:02.890 --> 02:04.958
ADULT ADAM:
It was Thanksgiving,
1980-something...

02:05.025 --> 02:08.696
The day that my universe would
literally change forever.

02:09.763 --> 02:14.034
E.T. the video game?
Wow!

02:14.101 --> 02:16.504
Oh, sweet
glorious balls!

02:16.570 --> 02:18.706
It's the commercial
for the new E.T. game.

02:18.772 --> 02:21.309
I love you, Atari!
You are a God!

02:21.375 --> 02:23.944
Are girls still a thing
for boys in high school?

02:24.011 --> 02:25.379
Remember this moment, Pops.

02:25.446 --> 02:28.716
After today,
our lives change forever.

02:28.782 --> 02:30.884
Different things
excite us.
(DOORBELL RINGS)

02:30.951 --> 02:33.254
ADULT ADAM: As I prepared
for the arrival of E.T.,

02:33.321 --> 02:36.023
Erica had just landed home
from college.

02:36.089 --> 02:37.525
Brace yourself, Geoff.

02:37.591 --> 02:38.792
I don't know which direction
my mom's coming at me,

02:38.859 --> 02:40.461
but she's coming in hard.

02:43.264 --> 02:45.899
Huh.
Schmoopaloo! Oh!

02:45.966 --> 02:48.602
Where did she come from?
I was looking
that exact direction.

02:48.669 --> 02:51.004
Oh, my baby's finally home
from college

02:51.071 --> 02:52.606
and back in my loving arms.

02:52.673 --> 02:54.542
So loving and strong.
I'm sorry.

02:54.608 --> 02:55.909
It's just this
is the best thing

02:55.976 --> 02:57.478
that's ever happened
to me in, like, ever.

02:57.545 --> 02:59.313
Glad to see
you're in such a good mood.

02:59.380 --> 03:01.782
Usually at Thanksgiving,
you're a frazzled,
gravy-stained mess.

03:01.849 --> 03:02.783
Well, not this year.

03:02.850 --> 03:05.018
The "Bevolution"
has begun, baby!

03:05.085 --> 03:07.955
Bevo-what?
My journey of change
and personal growth.

03:08.021 --> 03:09.957
Surely you've heard of it.
It's a very big deal.

03:10.023 --> 03:12.092
I've been busy with school
and getting into
college and stuff.

03:12.159 --> 03:17.731
Mmm. Well, this year,
Turkey Day is all about
taking it easy.

03:17.798 --> 03:20.067
So, you're not going to cook
for days without sleep

03:20.133 --> 03:21.469
and then break down crying

03:21.535 --> 03:22.503
because your ungrateful
children won't help?

03:22.570 --> 03:24.171
That me is dead and gone.

03:24.238 --> 03:27.341
This year, I've invited
50 people over for pot luck.

03:27.408 --> 03:28.542
I heard Coach is bringing

03:28.609 --> 03:30.143
his famous protein-packed
string beans.

03:30.210 --> 03:31.979
I have to eat
the Coach's food?

03:32.045 --> 03:33.514
I'm very depressed now.

03:33.581 --> 03:35.283
He can bring
whatever he wants.

03:35.349 --> 03:37.751
ADULT ADAM: Yep.
It'd be a casual
Thanksgiving for my mom.

03:37.818 --> 03:38.852
But not for my sister,

03:38.919 --> 03:41.422
who came home
with a whole lot of baggage.

03:41.489 --> 03:43.056
Take a break, Geoff.
I really have to talk to you.

03:43.123 --> 03:45.259
Oh, come on! I've only
been here for two minutes!

03:45.326 --> 03:46.694
Thanks for ruining my life,
Erica!

03:46.760 --> 03:48.562
Okay, what's happening
right now?

03:48.629 --> 03:50.531
We both know what's happening.
You're dumping me. I knew it.

03:50.598 --> 03:52.366
What? Why would
you think that?

03:52.433 --> 03:54.402
It's Thanksgiving break.
It's when people come home
from college

03:54.468 --> 03:56.103
and break up with
their high school sweetheart.

03:56.169 --> 03:57.805
It's a rite of passage.
They call it
the "Turkey Drop".

03:57.871 --> 03:59.907
Listen you big idiot,
I love you.

03:59.973 --> 04:00.974
I'm not dumping you.

04:01.041 --> 04:02.676
Yes! Love wins!

04:04.612 --> 04:06.414
No, Geoff.
Stop unpacking and listen.

04:06.480 --> 04:08.949
Oh, sorry, yeah.
What... What was
the serious talk about?

04:09.016 --> 04:11.251
Nothing much.
I'm just in crippling
credit-card debt.

04:11.319 --> 04:12.720
What? Who would give you
a credit card?

04:12.786 --> 04:14.422
You're completely
irresponsible.
I know!

04:14.488 --> 04:15.989
I was just walking to class,

04:16.056 --> 04:17.791
and there was this booth
with this really friendly dude

04:17.858 --> 04:19.660
who said if I'd
fill out this form

04:19.727 --> 04:21.395
then I would get a credit card
and a really cute beach tote.

04:21.462 --> 04:23.697
So, what do you owe?
Nothing to freak out over.

04:23.764 --> 04:26.534
$3,000?
At 33% interest?

04:26.600 --> 04:27.868
I know...
Pretty good, right?

04:27.935 --> 04:30.304
Oh, God, no!
You are completely clueless.

04:30.371 --> 04:31.572
But I love you.
Don't break up with me.

04:31.639 --> 04:33.707
Relax. I have a plan,
but I need your help.

04:33.774 --> 04:35.242
Whatever you need.
Okay.

04:35.309 --> 04:36.710
You coldly dump me
in front of my mom

04:36.777 --> 04:39.380
and then I run into her arms
crying my eyes out,

04:39.447 --> 04:40.914
thereby
lowering her defenses

04:40.981 --> 04:43.183
that when I ask for the money,
she has to say "Yes".

04:43.250 --> 04:44.685
Wait, so we are
breaking up?

04:44.752 --> 04:46.787
Yes, but not for real.
But it'll feel real to me.

04:46.854 --> 04:48.889
I'm too sensitive
for this bull crap.

04:48.956 --> 04:51.258
Seriously, Geoff?
If you can't be there
for me in a time of need,

04:51.325 --> 04:52.760
then why are we
even together?

04:52.826 --> 04:54.462
Oh, God, now you're
actually breaking up with me!

04:54.528 --> 04:56.063
Never mind. I'll just
figure it out on my own.

04:56.129 --> 04:58.031
On your own, like,
as a single woman,
on your own?

04:58.098 --> 04:59.633
No! God!
Wha!

04:59.700 --> 05:01.569
ADULT ADAM: While my sister
was trying to figure out

05:01.635 --> 05:04.338
how to get out of debt,
my brother was going
to get rich quick

05:04.405 --> 05:06.206
in my uncle's boiler room.

05:06.273 --> 05:07.508
Welcome to Wall Street,
gentlemen.

05:07.575 --> 05:09.142
I'm sure that Barry
has filled you in

05:09.209 --> 05:11.144
on the basics of our little
business endeavor.

05:11.211 --> 05:13.481
He told us we could triple
our money in three days.

05:13.547 --> 05:15.115
I can't make any promises.

05:15.182 --> 05:18.786
But what I can do is promise
that it will happen for sure.

05:18.852 --> 05:22.055
No question!
I like those odds.
Cough it up, JTP!

05:22.122 --> 05:23.524
JTP.
JTP.

05:23.591 --> 05:26.059
JTP.
Boom! Nest egg, baby!

05:26.126 --> 05:29.296
1,000 bucks?
My entire inheritance
from Aunt Rose.

05:29.363 --> 05:30.364
What?

05:30.431 --> 05:31.965
She left me nothing, man.

05:32.032 --> 05:34.602
I let her take my arm
to walk to the car once...

05:34.668 --> 05:37.438
Doesn't matter. All right.
Let's get rich.

05:37.505 --> 05:40.240
What am I doing, huh?
I'm pacing, right?

05:40.307 --> 05:41.875
Stockbrokers
never stand still.

05:41.942 --> 05:43.411
They're like
sharks on cocaine.

05:43.477 --> 05:47.848
What you want
is a dollop of gel.

05:47.915 --> 05:50.818
This is your phone!
Always scream into your phone!

05:50.884 --> 05:52.886
It makes you sound scary
and important!

05:52.953 --> 05:56.356
Make sure you can't see
fingers at all.

05:56.424 --> 05:58.792
Fire my secretary!
Hire a secretary!

05:58.859 --> 06:00.794
Well, how was
your weekend, Claude?

06:00.861 --> 06:02.530
Every hair must be in place,

06:02.596 --> 06:04.264
because if not,
it shows weakness.

06:04.331 --> 06:05.433
If you're gonna
work the floor,

06:05.499 --> 06:07.000
you got to know
the hand signals.

06:07.067 --> 06:08.268
Buy... Sell...

06:08.335 --> 06:10.203
Short the stock.
Long the stock.

06:10.270 --> 06:12.406
Shred the evidence.
I will fight all of you.

06:12.473 --> 06:13.807
Why'd you let the Feds
into my office?

06:13.874 --> 06:15.876
Call my wife.
Tell her that I'm sorry.

06:15.943 --> 06:18.145
Please don't send me to jail.
I will rat out everyone!

06:18.211 --> 06:20.681
Good? Whoo!

06:20.748 --> 06:23.050
Hey, Marvin, is that
your Cadillac in the driveway?

06:23.116 --> 06:26.353
Saw a couple of hobos
scraping up the gold
with a pocket knife.

06:26.420 --> 06:27.921
Get the hell
away from the...

06:27.988 --> 06:29.356
Where are the hobos?

06:29.423 --> 06:30.891
There are no hobos.

06:30.958 --> 06:33.160
Whatever harebrained scheme
you're up to,

06:33.226 --> 06:34.261
I want Barry out of it.

06:34.327 --> 06:35.863
I am just trying
to teach your son

06:35.929 --> 06:38.466
how to be like Charlie Sheen
from the movie Wall Street.

06:38.532 --> 06:41.535
He betrays his father
and goes to prison
in that movie.

06:41.602 --> 06:43.170
Thanks for blowing
the ending!

06:43.236 --> 06:45.773
Barry finally made
a good decision
to be a doctor.

06:45.839 --> 06:47.007
I'm not going to
let you ruin it

06:47.074 --> 06:48.509
with one of
your bonehead rackets.

06:48.576 --> 06:50.110
My "rackets"
are not boneheaded.

06:50.177 --> 06:52.446
Oh, yeah?
How about formal pajamas?

06:52.513 --> 06:53.547
Baby college?

06:53.614 --> 06:54.582
Powdered yogurt?

06:54.648 --> 06:56.016
Dogs for dogs?

06:56.083 --> 06:57.050
Foot mittens?

06:57.117 --> 06:58.552
Spoons made out of meat?

06:58.619 --> 07:00.588
Airplanes
that just drive?

07:00.654 --> 07:02.089
Ground planes
was a good idea.

07:02.155 --> 07:03.256
That's called a bus!

07:03.323 --> 07:05.025
Clearly,
I know what I'm doing

07:05.092 --> 07:07.461
or else Barry wouldn't
trust me with
his life inheritance.

07:07.528 --> 07:10.330
Lucky for Barry,
I don't trust you.

07:10.397 --> 07:12.265
Ground planes
was a good idea.

07:12.332 --> 07:14.868
ADULT ADAM: As my dad
was sabotaging
Barry's new career,

07:14.935 --> 07:18.071
my sister was about to
work our mom for some cash.

07:18.138 --> 07:21.141
Did you know
there's a wonderful
parade on Thanksgiving?

07:21.208 --> 07:23.744
Seriously, why have I been
torturing myself

07:23.811 --> 07:25.579
every year at Thanksgiving

07:25.646 --> 07:27.981
when it is so much easier
to let Virginia Kremp
do everything?

07:28.048 --> 07:29.917
Bevy, do you have
another pan?

07:29.983 --> 07:31.519
I think we're crowding
the carrots.

07:31.585 --> 07:33.821
You got this, Ginzy.
VIRGINIA: I really don't!

07:33.887 --> 07:35.556
This is the best
Thanksgiving ever!

07:35.623 --> 07:37.190
It's not.

07:37.257 --> 07:38.492
Me and Geoff had a fight.

07:38.559 --> 07:40.360
Ooh, is he
going to get it!

07:40.427 --> 07:41.929
No, no, no.
Don't bring it up to him.
Just take my word for it.

07:41.995 --> 07:43.731
I can't actually
stir the gravy

07:43.797 --> 07:45.499
and baste the bird
at the same time.
Can't do it.

07:45.566 --> 07:47.735
Point is, I could really
use your love
and help right now.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.570
Can't do it. Only one woman.
You name it, Schmoopy.

07:49.637 --> 07:51.805
Whatever I can do,
I'm here for you.

07:51.872 --> 07:53.541
Maybe...

07:53.607 --> 07:56.076
(SOFTLY ) Give me $3,000
so I can pay off
my credit-card debt?

07:56.143 --> 07:57.377
$3,000?

07:57.444 --> 07:59.379
Who the hell would give you
a credit card?

07:59.446 --> 08:00.981
(NORMAL VOICE)
I know I messed up,

08:01.048 --> 08:03.050
but you can't be mad,
because my heart still hurts

08:03.116 --> 08:04.451
from that fight
I mentioned earlier.

08:04.518 --> 08:06.386
Oh! Oh!
Mommy, please.

08:06.453 --> 08:09.122
Rescue your little squishy,
snuggly shmoopie-woopie

08:09.189 --> 08:10.524
from the mean money man.

08:10.591 --> 08:12.292
No way!
I just picked up
a whole pan of hot yams

08:12.359 --> 08:13.994
without oven mitts!
Erica,
you spent the money.

08:14.061 --> 08:15.295
That means you got
to figure out a way
to pay it back.

08:15.362 --> 08:16.664
But you're supposed
to bail me out

08:16.730 --> 08:18.265
and I learn
some stupid life lesson

08:18.331 --> 08:19.700
and we both
go on our merry ways.

08:19.767 --> 08:21.802
If I bail you out,
you'll never learn a lesson.

08:21.869 --> 08:23.771
Viva la Bevolution!

08:23.837 --> 08:26.439
Oh! Oh,
sweet buttered corn!

08:26.506 --> 08:28.175
Keep going, Ginzy.
I believe in you.

08:28.241 --> 08:31.211
Beverly, please! Beverly!
I really hate
the Bevolution.

08:31.278 --> 08:32.713
VIRGINIA: This is your home!

08:34.682 --> 08:35.816
Geoff, stop organizing
my tapes.

08:35.883 --> 08:37.350
Did it work?
No!

08:37.417 --> 08:39.820
Can you believe my mom
didn't just hand over $3,000?

08:39.887 --> 08:41.354
Maybe I can help.
I'm pretty good with money.

08:41.421 --> 08:43.223
You have money? I need money.
Can I have your money?

08:43.290 --> 08:45.492
Well, it's from my Bar Mitzvah
and it's kind of for college.

08:45.559 --> 08:47.494
It's perfect.
I'm in college.

08:47.561 --> 08:50.030
Yeah, I... I guess I can
go down to the bank
with my mom

08:50.097 --> 08:52.032
so she can co-sign
the withdrawal and...

08:52.099 --> 08:54.134
Please. We know
that Linda will be
a big jerk and say, "No".

08:54.201 --> 08:56.236
Right. She's the worst!
I'll never forgive
her for this!

08:56.303 --> 08:58.005
Are you just agreeing with me
so I don't dump you?

08:58.071 --> 09:00.708
No! Yes! I don't know!
I'm totally freaking out, man.

09:00.774 --> 09:02.442
I just sold out
my own mother so fast!

09:02.509 --> 09:04.678
I should be the one
freaking out, Geoff.
I'm so screwed.

09:04.745 --> 09:06.947
Well, on the bright side,
at least you didn't sink
all your money

09:07.014 --> 09:08.248
into some investment scam
like Barry.

09:08.315 --> 09:10.250
Investment scam.
What investment scam?

09:10.317 --> 09:12.385
Oh, no! Please don't join
your uncle's illicit
"Boiler Room".

09:12.452 --> 09:13.787
They have a boiler room?
Where?

09:13.854 --> 09:15.322
In your basement,
next to the actual boiler.

09:15.388 --> 09:17.891
Sweet!
All I have to do
is get a credit card,

09:17.958 --> 09:19.326
take out a cash advance,

09:19.392 --> 09:21.328
and get in on my uncle's
shady get-rich scheme.

09:21.394 --> 09:22.996
Oh! I love you.

09:23.563 --> 09:24.932
(SIGHS)

09:25.866 --> 09:28.201
All right,
JTP minus Geoff.

09:28.268 --> 09:29.469
ALL: JTP minus Geoff!

09:29.536 --> 09:31.905
Now that insane riches
shall be showered upon us,

09:31.972 --> 09:34.942
it is crucial we make smart
decisions on how to spend it.

09:35.008 --> 09:36.910
I'm going to do that
"Duck Tales" thing

09:36.977 --> 09:38.879
where I dive into
a mountain of gold coins.

09:38.946 --> 09:40.748
I can't decide
whether I want a bidet

09:40.814 --> 09:42.750
or a butler
who will do bidet stuff.

09:42.816 --> 09:43.784
That's a private
decision, bro.

09:43.851 --> 09:45.385
Big news, fellas.

09:45.452 --> 09:48.121
I pooled all of your cash
into this perfect investment.

09:48.188 --> 09:51.158
It's an electronics company,
and they sell
computer thingies.

09:51.224 --> 09:52.092
Score!
Wall Street!

09:52.159 --> 09:54.261
Dow Jones!
I'm not done, yet.

09:54.327 --> 09:58.799
As of this morning, our stock
has gone up 25 points.

09:58.866 --> 10:00.768
Is that good or terrible?

10:00.834 --> 10:02.035
Tell us how to feel.

10:02.102 --> 10:03.370
We quadrupled our money.
We're rich!

10:03.436 --> 10:05.673
ALL: We're rich,
we're rich, we're rich!

10:05.739 --> 10:08.375
Except for Barry.
Because your dad
pulled the check out,

10:08.441 --> 10:09.710
you get squat.
What?

10:09.777 --> 10:11.712
Most of us are rich,
most of us are rich!

10:11.779 --> 10:14.014
This is insane.
How could you just
turn your back on me?

10:14.081 --> 10:16.616
I guess 'cause
we're millionaires
now and you're not.

10:16.684 --> 10:19.753
Yeah, we just don't have
that much in common
anymore, you know.

10:19.820 --> 10:22.055
But this literally
just happened.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.324
Chin up, bud. I'm always
going to be your uncle.

10:24.391 --> 10:26.894
I mean, I may not see you as
much now that I'm rich as God

10:26.960 --> 10:28.796
and you're just some
middle-class piece of garbage.

10:28.862 --> 10:30.530
My dad is so dead!

10:30.597 --> 10:31.799
Can you not do that?

10:31.865 --> 10:33.100
We don't scream
now that we're rich.

10:34.835 --> 10:36.737
I'm middle class!

10:36.804 --> 10:38.806
(SOBBING LOUDLY)

10:43.944 --> 10:45.979
ADULT ADAM: After buttering up
my mom had failed,

10:46.046 --> 10:48.982
it was time for my sister
to solve the problem herself.

10:49.049 --> 10:51.518
Hi. Are you headed into
First National Bank?

10:51.584 --> 10:52.986
Um, yeah?

10:53.053 --> 10:55.088
Because I can literally
save you tens of seconds

10:55.155 --> 10:57.557
by handling all your
important banking matters

10:57.624 --> 10:58.792
right here
at this folding table.

10:58.859 --> 11:00.928
9th National Bank?
Is that a thing?

11:00.994 --> 11:02.595
It sure is.
We may be ninth,

11:02.662 --> 11:04.698
but we always put
our customers first
at this bank.

11:04.765 --> 11:06.466
Not actually a bank,
not FDIC insured.

11:06.533 --> 11:08.635
Doesn't matter.
I need a credit card,
and I need one fast.

11:08.702 --> 11:10.871
Normally, it takes
about two weeks.

11:10.938 --> 11:13.707
But I can see you're not here
for any weird reason.

11:13.774 --> 11:15.275
Definitely not.
So what's your name?

11:16.143 --> 11:18.378
It's...uh...

11:18.445 --> 11:20.480
See, people don't
normally pause this much

11:20.547 --> 11:22.115
on the most basic
question there is.

11:22.182 --> 11:24.184
It's Beverly.
Beverly Goldberg.

11:24.251 --> 11:26.820
Perfect, Beverly.
One moment, please.

11:27.554 --> 11:28.856
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

11:40.467 --> 11:43.904
Beverly, I have great news.
Your credit is excelente,

11:43.971 --> 11:45.873
so I just need to see
a photo ID.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.743
Yeah, um, it's...

11:51.011 --> 11:53.981
Hurry up, please.
Oh, there it is.

11:54.047 --> 11:55.448
MAN: Well, your thumb
is over the first name,

11:55.515 --> 11:57.150
but I can see your last name
is Goldberg,

11:57.217 --> 11:58.551
so let's get you
that credit card.

11:58.618 --> 11:59.920
Great! Great!

11:59.987 --> 12:02.489
Uh, and I would like
to take a cash advance

12:02.555 --> 12:04.257
made out to Erica Goldberg.

12:04.324 --> 12:05.826
Whatever you need,
Beverly.

12:05.893 --> 12:07.327
(SPEAKS SPANISH) Bueno.

12:08.028 --> 12:09.129
This is it, Dad.

12:09.196 --> 12:11.298
E.T. the Video Game
has landed.

12:11.364 --> 12:13.200
Go away.
I knew you'd say that,

12:13.266 --> 12:15.903
which is why I made a yummy
trail of Reese's Pieces

12:15.969 --> 12:18.071
to distract you
while I play.

12:18.138 --> 12:20.173
Damn it, you're making me
bend down.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.775
But I can't stop!

12:22.242 --> 12:23.443
(LAUGHS)

12:24.845 --> 12:26.413
ADULT ADAM: This was it...

12:26.479 --> 12:29.082
The moment the blockbuster
met a legendary game maker.

12:29.149 --> 12:31.184
Look at these
awesome graphics, Lucky.

12:31.251 --> 12:33.653
Classic Atari.
Let's do this.

12:33.720 --> 12:36.489
Dude, look at E.T.
go... Slowly.

12:36.556 --> 12:38.025
He's moving slowly.

12:38.091 --> 12:39.492
Oop, fell
in a little pit there.

12:39.559 --> 12:41.128
No big deal.
I'll get him out.

12:41.829 --> 12:43.130
Mmm. Damn it!

12:43.196 --> 12:44.331
Balls!

12:44.397 --> 12:46.133
Seriously!

12:46.199 --> 12:47.134
Not again!

12:47.200 --> 12:48.768
How is E.T.
supposed to get home

12:48.836 --> 12:50.137
if he keeps falling
in these pits?

12:50.203 --> 12:52.973
I just died in the pit.
E.T. is dead.

12:53.040 --> 12:56.109
Oh! None of this
is from the movie!

12:56.176 --> 12:58.345
Father, I've come
for the money you owe me.

12:58.411 --> 13:00.647
I'll take it
in thousand dollar bills. Go!

13:00.713 --> 13:04.818
What's this about?
Marvin's stock went through
the roof and I got jack!

13:04.885 --> 13:06.653
Well, I did not
see that coming.

13:06.719 --> 13:09.156
Well, even a broken clock
is right twice a day.

13:09.222 --> 13:11.624
This has nothing to do
with telling time!

13:11.691 --> 13:14.194
Look, I only took your check
'cause I was trying
to protect you.

13:14.261 --> 13:15.528
From what?

13:15.595 --> 13:18.065
Having an amazing life
with a personal sandwich chef

13:18.131 --> 13:19.799
and a top hat
made of diamonds?

13:19.867 --> 13:22.235
Trust me, you don't want
to live the crazy life
of Marvin.

13:22.302 --> 13:24.271
Oh, your boring old life
is so great.

13:24.337 --> 13:26.106
I got no complaints.
You should!

13:26.173 --> 13:28.508
All you do is take off
your pants, watch TV,

13:28.575 --> 13:30.377
and raise a bunch
of ungrateful, awful kids.

13:30.443 --> 13:32.345
You're one
of those ungrateful kids.

13:32.412 --> 13:34.347
You're insulting yourself,
you moron!

13:34.414 --> 13:38.518
Point is, last thing
I want is some
pathetic life like yours.

13:39.819 --> 13:41.388
So that's how you feel.

13:41.922 --> 13:43.390
Fine. Here.

13:45.158 --> 13:47.460
Take it.
And to think I was gonna
buy the Eagles

13:47.527 --> 13:49.429
and let you kick
a field goal every game.

13:50.530 --> 13:52.132
BARRY: Make me rich!

13:52.199 --> 13:54.734
Big Tasty's back in, baby!
Hope it's not too late.

13:54.801 --> 13:56.036
So you don't make
$100 million,

13:56.103 --> 13:57.871
you make $50,
does it even matter?

13:57.938 --> 13:59.006
It does not!

13:59.072 --> 14:01.574
Make me rich!
That is $500.

14:01.641 --> 14:03.710
Can you turn that into $3,000
in, like, 5 hours?

14:03.776 --> 14:05.879
Sure. If there's anything
I know about stocks,

14:05.946 --> 14:07.280
it's that they're
always going up, right?

14:07.347 --> 14:08.448
Um, I don't think you
understand the basics

14:08.515 --> 14:10.217
of how the economy works.
Bup-bup!

14:10.283 --> 14:12.252
So what's this awesome company
that we're investing in?

14:12.319 --> 14:14.754
They sell these electronic
computer thingies.

14:14.821 --> 14:16.189
And what exactly
are the "thingies"?

14:16.256 --> 14:17.891
They're called Ataris,

14:17.958 --> 14:21.061
and that's Japanese
for "Sure Thing".

14:21.128 --> 14:23.163
Yeah, hello,
buy all the Atari stock.

14:23.230 --> 14:25.165
Do it!
Thank you, Jessica.

14:25.232 --> 14:28.168
Atari? Why does that sound
so familiar?

14:28.235 --> 14:31.438
And in financial news,
Atari stock has taken a hit

14:31.504 --> 14:34.474
due to weak sales
of its E.T. video game.

14:34.541 --> 14:36.143
This is not good.

14:36.209 --> 14:38.545
Legend says they're burying
all the unsold copies
in the desert.

14:38.611 --> 14:41.514
Why didn't you tell us
about that game, nerd?

14:41.581 --> 14:44.051
It is literally
all I've been talking about!

14:44.117 --> 14:45.718
You know we don't listen
when you speak.

14:45.785 --> 14:48.888
She's right.
This is all your fault.
Get him!

14:48.956 --> 14:50.590
ERICA: Now I owe
even more money.

14:50.657 --> 14:52.125
How could you
let me do this, Geoff?

14:52.192 --> 14:54.161
Me? All I wanted
was to stay together,

14:54.227 --> 14:56.096
but what's the point?

14:56.163 --> 14:57.730
Your credit's in the crapper.
Now we'll never afford
a starter home.

14:57.797 --> 14:59.532
Starter home?

14:59.599 --> 15:01.534
I thought we were
going to live in the city
for a few years.

15:01.601 --> 15:03.336
You know,
mattress on the floor
like young starving artists.

15:03.403 --> 15:05.939
We can't even afford
a bed frame?
That's no life!

15:06.006 --> 15:07.074
I'm going to be
an ophthalmologist.

15:07.140 --> 15:08.575
I need
a good night's sleep.

15:08.641 --> 15:10.177
Oh, so you're just going
to put your work above me?

15:10.243 --> 15:11.811
Your head is always
at the office, Geoffrey.

15:11.878 --> 15:14.047
Why are you making me choose?
I put in the hours for you!

15:14.114 --> 15:15.983
Hey, he's right, Erica.
He works hard.

15:16.049 --> 15:17.150
Get off his back.

15:17.217 --> 15:18.751
Do not side with him.

15:18.818 --> 15:21.421
Because of you, I had to take
out a Mexican credit card

15:21.488 --> 15:22.255
in my mom's name.

15:22.322 --> 15:24.857
You did what?
Mom! Hi!

15:24.924 --> 15:26.326
Before you get mad,

15:26.393 --> 15:27.694
just remember that the new
Beverly is super chill

15:27.760 --> 15:29.462
and doesn't mix in
when her kids screw up.

15:29.529 --> 15:33.100
Oh, you mixed me right in
when you stole my identity!

15:33.166 --> 15:34.567
That's only because
my dopey uncle

15:34.634 --> 15:37.070
promised me riches in a fast
and unrealistic way.

15:37.137 --> 15:39.239
How dare you disparage
my good name.

15:39.306 --> 15:40.607
I run a reputable
boiler room

15:40.673 --> 15:42.475
in the basement
with a teenage clientele.

15:42.542 --> 15:44.177
You know what?
I don't have to
explain myself to you.

15:44.244 --> 15:45.345
I am so out of here!

15:45.412 --> 15:48.048
No! No!
Nobody leaves!

15:48.115 --> 15:50.650
It is
Thanks-(BLEEP)-giving!

15:51.851 --> 15:52.952
Hi.

15:53.020 --> 15:54.254
Things sounded kind
of tense in here,

15:54.321 --> 15:56.256
so we figured
we'd wait it out.

15:59.759 --> 16:02.529
ADULT ADAM:
Our potluck Thanksgiving
had finally arrived.

16:02.595 --> 16:04.397
And in true
Goldberg tradition,

16:04.464 --> 16:06.299
it was not off
to a great start.

16:06.366 --> 16:08.235
VIRGINIA: Yoo-hoo!
(GLASS CLINKS)

16:08.301 --> 16:09.769
Why don't we
go around the table

16:09.836 --> 16:12.272
and everyone say one thing
that you're thankful for.

16:12.339 --> 16:14.774
Can someone send
some turkey to the foyer?

16:14.841 --> 16:18.211
I'm thankful my daughter
hasn't changed at all

16:18.278 --> 16:19.579
since going to college.

16:19.646 --> 16:21.748
She's still the same
as she's always been.

16:21.814 --> 16:22.882
Aw!

16:22.949 --> 16:24.917
Shady and selfish.

16:24.984 --> 16:27.020
Shellfish?
We're having shellfish?

16:27.087 --> 16:28.821
What kind of Thanksgiving
is this?

16:28.888 --> 16:32.359
Well, I'm thankful for my mom,
who abandoned me,

16:32.425 --> 16:34.161
which is why I went
to my ridiculous uncle.

16:34.227 --> 16:35.628
Well,
I'm thankful for Murray,

16:35.695 --> 16:38.165
who taught his kids
to disrespect me

16:38.231 --> 16:39.532
as much as he does!

16:39.599 --> 16:41.901
Well, I am thankful
for my moron brother,

16:41.968 --> 16:45.705
who derailed my son's future
in less than 12 hours!

16:45.772 --> 16:48.175
Please don't turn this
fun tradition into something
ugly and spiteful.

16:48.241 --> 16:49.709
Well, I'm thankful
for my father,

16:49.776 --> 16:51.944
who wants me to be lame
and boring like him.

16:52.011 --> 16:54.914
Please!
And I'm thankful
for my idiot son,

16:54.981 --> 16:56.583
who insults me to my core

16:56.649 --> 16:58.318
even though I'm just
trying to help him.

16:58.385 --> 16:59.986
And I'm thankful...
Shut up!

17:00.053 --> 17:03.256
Did you really think I was not
going to find out about that?

17:03.323 --> 17:05.325
(INDISTINCT ARGUING)

17:06.626 --> 17:09.862
Oh, no, the giant man
is eating all the turkey!

17:09.929 --> 17:11.364
It never even got to me!

17:11.431 --> 17:13.266
This is why I don't
invite you anywhere!

17:13.333 --> 17:15.868
You know I need a constant
stream of protein!

17:15.935 --> 17:17.804
Somebody
say something nice now!

17:17.870 --> 17:19.239
Happy Thanks...
(GRUNTS)

17:19.306 --> 17:21.308
Go around the back.

17:21.374 --> 17:22.942
Something... Something's
blocking the door.

17:23.009 --> 17:26.045
It's me!
Go around!

17:26.113 --> 17:28.348
ADULT ADAM:
There, in the clatter
of everybody arguing,

17:28.415 --> 17:29.982
my family started to realize

17:30.049 --> 17:33.086
perhaps they had forgotten
the things that matter most.

17:34.521 --> 17:38.091
Lucky for my sister,
not everyone did that day.

17:38.158 --> 17:39.226
Geoff, what is this?

17:39.292 --> 17:40.593
My Bar Mitzvah money.

17:40.660 --> 17:42.229
It should be enough
to pay your mom back.

17:43.296 --> 17:44.831
Wow, you'd do that for me?

17:44.897 --> 17:46.599
Of course.

17:46.666 --> 17:48.368
Erica, I want to
take care of you
for the rest of our lives.

17:48.435 --> 17:50.503
And I want to
take care of you.

17:50.570 --> 17:52.572
Which is why
I can't take this.

17:52.639 --> 17:53.840
Seriously?

17:53.906 --> 17:56.143
I'm not going to have
someone bail me out again.

17:56.209 --> 17:57.877
It's up to me to fix it.

17:57.944 --> 18:01.514
I mean, if my mom
can become a better person,
then so can I.

18:01.581 --> 18:04.384
Wow.
That's really responsible

18:04.451 --> 18:06.886
and kind of strange to hear
coming out of your mouth.

18:06.953 --> 18:08.988
But I like it.

18:09.055 --> 18:11.124
Yeah, I do, too.

18:13.660 --> 18:14.827
For the record,

18:14.894 --> 18:17.397
I'd do the whole mattress
on the floor thing for you.

18:17.464 --> 18:21.401
For the record, I'm never
breaking up with you.

18:21.468 --> 18:23.903
* And I think it's gonna
be a long, long time *

18:23.970 --> 18:28.208
ADULT ADAM: That day,
Erica realized it was time
to stand on her own.

18:29.075 --> 18:30.577
And after everything,

18:30.643 --> 18:33.413
my dad was ready to step up
to lend Marvin a hand.

18:35.081 --> 18:36.483
Hey.

18:36.549 --> 18:38.151
I took a hit on my stock,

18:38.218 --> 18:40.687
so I figured
I'd pawn my hub cabs.

18:40.753 --> 18:42.755
* Rocket man, burning out
his fuse up here alone *

18:42.822 --> 18:44.257
Don't. Here.

18:47.727 --> 18:49.929
What, do you want
to play the market?

18:49.996 --> 18:52.499
Keep it.
Happy Thanksgiving.

18:53.099 --> 18:54.867
Mur-Man...

18:54.934 --> 18:56.669
Oh, thank you!

18:56.736 --> 18:59.239
Oh, thank you so much!
Thank you.

18:59.306 --> 19:02.175
ADULT ADAM: In that moment,
my brother saw
that the best life

19:02.242 --> 19:05.712
wasn't necessarily
the flashiest life.
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

19:06.145 --> 19:07.580
Whoa.

19:07.647 --> 19:10.517
Did you just bail out
Uncle Marvin?

19:10.583 --> 19:14.187
Yeah, he's family.
It's... It's what we do.

19:14.254 --> 19:16.456
Well, I don't want
to be the guy

19:16.523 --> 19:17.890
who you always
have to bail out.

19:18.958 --> 19:20.260
Who do you want to be?

19:21.060 --> 19:22.529
You.

19:22.595 --> 19:25.665
* Till touch down brings
me round again to find

19:25.732 --> 19:28.968
* I'm not the man
they think I am at home

19:29.035 --> 19:31.371
* Oh, no, no, no

19:31.438 --> 19:33.740
I think
this belongs to you.

19:35.508 --> 19:37.277
"9th National Bank".

19:37.344 --> 19:39.712
You should cut it up,
like, immediately.

19:39.779 --> 19:41.748
Well, that would
be a start.
I know.

19:41.814 --> 19:44.884
Which is why I'm going to take
a work-study to pay you back.

19:44.951 --> 19:47.954
And I'm sure it'll take
a long time for you
to forgive me,

19:48.020 --> 19:49.356
but I promise...

19:49.422 --> 19:51.224
I forgive you.

19:51.291 --> 19:53.960
Really?
I know what I said.

19:54.026 --> 19:55.628
The thing is,

19:55.695 --> 19:58.665
I'm always going to want
to swoop in and save you.

19:58.731 --> 20:00.199
But I think we both know,
in the end,

20:00.267 --> 20:01.968
it doesn't help
either of us.

20:02.034 --> 20:04.036
I'm proud of you, Mom.

20:04.103 --> 20:06.273
You're really trying
to change.

20:06.339 --> 20:08.040
Kind of makes me
want to change, too.

20:08.107 --> 20:09.842
You know, this whole thing
has made me think

20:09.909 --> 20:12.245
maybe there are some things
in this family

20:12.312 --> 20:13.980
that should never
be touched.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.515
Like what?

20:15.582 --> 20:17.384
* And I think it's gonna be
a long long time *

20:17.450 --> 20:20.787
ADULT ADAM: And so,
we went back
to our usual Thanksgiving.

20:20.853 --> 20:23.990
When I think back to my family
sitting around that table,

20:24.056 --> 20:26.526
everyone together
happy and healthy...

20:26.593 --> 20:29.762
Those were the best times
of my life.

20:31.464 --> 20:33.666
Truth is,
I couldn't see it then,

20:33.733 --> 20:36.202
but those are
the richest memories
I'm most thankful for.

20:50.883 --> 20:52.685
Yeah! (LAUGHS)

20:54.854 --> 20:57.189
Oh, hello, Miss Goldberg.
Back for another credit card?

20:57.256 --> 20:59.826
Perhaps a small business loan?
I know you're good for it.

20:59.892 --> 21:01.761
Cut the crap.
You and I both know

21:01.828 --> 21:04.163
that I'm not Beverly
and you're not a legit bank.

21:04.230 --> 21:07.033
Cancel this account.
Of course.
I'd be delighted to.

21:07.099 --> 21:08.901
Ohh. Little snaff here.

21:08.968 --> 21:11.471
Uh, you opened this
with 9th National.

21:11.538 --> 21:13.440
As you can see,
that's not us.

21:13.506 --> 21:15.241
Do what she says now!

21:15.308 --> 21:16.776
Mom, I thought you said

21:16.843 --> 21:18.845
that you weren't gonna
swoop in and save me anymore.

21:18.911 --> 21:21.314
I know. But Mama's name
is on that card,

21:21.381 --> 21:23.282
so Mama's gonna take
this one last ride.

21:23.350 --> 21:25.752
Okay, I can see
that you mean business.

21:25.818 --> 21:28.821
