00:22.426 --> 00:25.261
Tina, quick, Rorschach test, go.

00:25.296 --> 00:27.163
Um, Greg Kinnear from
<i>As Good as It Gets?</i>

00:27.197 --> 00:28.498
Yes, wow.

00:28.532 --> 00:30.494
Shh, shh, I'm on the phone
with the bank.

00:30.614 --> 00:32.668
Okay, so bounce the check
to the power company,

00:32.703 --> 00:34.337
bounce the check to the relish guy,

00:34.371 --> 00:36.906
but make sure
the beef supplier goes through.

00:36.941 --> 00:39.275
Without beef,
the whole system falls apart.

00:39.310 --> 00:41.761
(laughing): Yeah, at least my
bedroom beef supply is free.

00:41.795 --> 00:42.929
Yeah.

00:42.963 --> 00:43.930
Sheesh.

00:43.964 --> 00:44.931
Thanks, Marci.

00:44.965 --> 00:46.132
You're a lifesaver.

00:46.166 --> 00:47.850
I'll talk to you later, honey.

00:47.885 --> 00:49.452
God, I can't believe we're
doing controlled bounces,

00:49.486 --> 00:51.621
and I can't believe you talk
that way to the bank.

00:51.655 --> 00:53.189
Oh, what, with Marci?

00:53.223 --> 00:54.791
It's okay. We don't
have any secrets.

00:54.825 --> 00:56.976
You know, her husband had to
get recircumcised last year.

00:57.011 --> 00:58.344
The first one grew back.

00:58.379 --> 01:00.530
They don't grow back.
Somehow it did.

01:00.564 --> 01:02.799
They had to have an adult
"brisk"; it was freaky.

01:02.833 --> 01:04.867
It's not a brisk;
it's a bris.

01:04.902 --> 01:07.136
All this brisket talk
is making me hungry.

01:07.171 --> 01:09.706
And why do you do the books
this way? Your system is crazy.

01:09.740 --> 01:11.981
It's the only way to keep
our heads above water, my love.

01:12.009 --> 01:14.369
Well, then, we've got to find
a way to cut down on expenses.

01:14.378 --> 01:16.045
What can we live without?

01:16.080 --> 01:18.881
Uh, probably Gene and Tina.
That's a good start.

01:18.916 --> 01:20.183
Huh, well, it makes the things

01:20.217 --> 01:21.217
I was gonna cut irrelevant.

01:21.251 --> 01:22.518
Good.

01:22.553 --> 01:23.886
You know what?
I could get a part-time job.

01:23.921 --> 01:25.355
Huh, what?

01:25.389 --> 01:27.457
No, Lin, it hasn't come to that yet.

01:27.491 --> 01:28.558
Yeah, you're right.

01:28.592 --> 01:30.126
Hey, maybe I'll start shopping

01:30.160 --> 01:32.028
at that Fresh Feed place up the street.

01:32.062 --> 01:33.463
I hear it's really cheap.

01:33.497 --> 01:34.897
Oh, yeah, that's good.

01:34.932 --> 01:37.133
They have those peanut
butter mini donuts.

01:37.167 --> 01:39.686
I prefer the yogurt-covered
peanut butter mini donuts,

01:39.720 --> 01:41.788
but, hey, I have a refined palette.

01:41.822 --> 01:43.723
Refined?
You lick your own armpits.

01:43.757 --> 01:45.758
They're naturally spicy.

01:48.195 --> 01:50.563
"People go nuts for our nuts."

01:50.597 --> 01:52.198
(laughs)
What a hoot. I love it.

01:52.232 --> 01:54.067
"In a hurry for some curry?"

01:54.101 --> 01:55.401
Hmm, kind of.

01:56.337 --> 01:59.572
Mmm... mmm... mmm.

01:59.606 --> 02:01.708
Hey, buddy, one sample per customer.

02:01.742 --> 02:04.043
A serving size is four mini egg rolls.

02:04.078 --> 02:07.747
Therefore, four pieces
equals one sample.

02:07.781 --> 02:09.348
Good day, sir.

02:09.383 --> 02:10.683
(growls)

02:10.717 --> 02:13.419
I think there's someone behind the milk.

02:13.454 --> 02:14.587
Maybe it's a dairy fairy.

02:14.621 --> 02:16.422
Or a stalker watching our every move

02:16.457 --> 02:18.391
with their creepy frozen eyes.

02:18.425 --> 02:19.392
Hi.

02:19.426 --> 02:21.594
Look at these crazy low prices.

02:21.628 --> 02:23.329
Excuse me, Greg.

02:23.364 --> 02:24.731
Uh, hi, Greg.

02:24.765 --> 02:26.532
Yeah, can you tell me where the wine is?

02:26.567 --> 02:28.267
Ah, the grown-up grape juice.

02:28.302 --> 02:30.770
Come with me to our vineyard.

02:30.804 --> 02:32.605
Ooh, wine in a squeeze bottle.

02:32.639 --> 02:33.639
Fun.
(disco music playing)

02:33.640 --> 02:35.041
Oh.
Huh?

02:35.075 --> 02:37.243
It's time for a disco minute.

02:37.277 --> 02:38.444
How long's it last?

02:38.479 --> 02:39.512
A minute.

02:39.546 --> 02:41.214
It must be great working here.

02:41.248 --> 02:42.415
Yup, we have fun.

02:42.449 --> 02:43.583
It's kind of our thing.

02:43.617 --> 02:45.184
I love it when a place has a thing.

02:45.219 --> 02:46.452
And the hours are flexible,

02:46.487 --> 02:48.688
which is fantastic for someone like me.

02:48.722 --> 02:50.456
You never know when the perfect breeze

02:50.491 --> 02:52.024
is going to blow.
Huh?

02:52.059 --> 02:53.559
I'm a semipro kite pilot.

02:53.594 --> 02:54.961
A what?
I don't understand.

02:54.995 --> 02:56.295
What part do you not understand?

02:56.330 --> 02:57.730
The words--
I don't understand them.

02:57.765 --> 02:59.065
I'm a kite pilot.

02:59.099 --> 03:00.199
Kite pilot.

03:00.234 --> 03:01.567
Mm-hmm, my babies.

03:01.602 --> 03:03.469
Okay.

03:03.504 --> 03:04.737
Wow, that's great.

03:04.772 --> 03:06.305
So there's flexible hours here, huh?

03:06.340 --> 03:08.408
Hey, did this just
become a job interview?

03:08.442 --> 03:09.409
You interested?

03:09.443 --> 03:11.077
Me? What? No.

03:11.111 --> 03:13.479
No, I don't know,
I couldn't-- no...

03:13.514 --> 03:16.082
Guess who got a job at Fresh Feed.

03:16.116 --> 03:17.550
Check it out.

03:17.584 --> 03:19.085
That's what Mom will be doing
at the checkout.

03:19.119 --> 03:20.887
Yeah, paper or plastic, Mom?

03:20.921 --> 03:22.955
Am I right?
All right.

03:22.990 --> 03:24.424
What, you got a job?

03:24.458 --> 03:26.626
But it hasn't come to that yet,
remember?

03:26.660 --> 03:28.227
I think what Mom's trying to say is:

03:28.262 --> 03:30.329
"Take this job
and shove it, Bob!"

03:30.364 --> 03:33.099
Yeah, I'm bringing home
the bacon now. (laughs)

03:33.133 --> 03:34.600
Oh, I forgot to get bacon.

03:34.635 --> 03:36.636
We have to go back!
(panting)

03:37.215 --> 03:40.277
You really got out of bed this morning.

03:40.397 --> 03:41.277
I couldn't wait!

03:41.335 --> 03:44.036
Oh, I'm so freaking excited
about my first day on the job!

03:44.071 --> 03:45.538
Yeah, I heard you the first time,

03:45.572 --> 03:46.972
when you were singing in the shower.

03:47.007 --> 03:48.891
♪ I'm so freaking excited

03:48.925 --> 03:51.227
♪ About my first day
on the job. ♪

03:51.261 --> 03:53.412
Yeah!
Ow, ow! Soap in my eye!

03:53.447 --> 03:56.115
You finally got out, Mom.
Don't look back.

03:56.149 --> 03:57.883
It's only part-time.
Don't be so dramatic.

03:57.918 --> 03:59.838
It's just something
I'm doing to save the family.

03:59.853 --> 04:01.587
No big deal.

04:03.090 --> 04:04.657
Hey, Greg!
Hey, Linda.

04:04.691 --> 04:06.392
Show me around.
Give me the tour.

04:06.426 --> 04:08.110
Okay. A little
pushy there.

04:08.128 --> 04:09.612
Ooh, is that a water cooler?

04:09.646 --> 04:11.447
Oh, God, I'm gonna be gossiping around

04:11.465 --> 04:13.132
a real water cooler like on TV!

04:13.166 --> 04:14.817
I love it. Aw...

04:14.851 --> 04:16.918
This is the bread aisle.
There's Mitch.

04:16.952 --> 04:19.321
He's in a Steve Miller Band cover band.

04:19.356 --> 04:21.423
Hey, does anyone call
you the Space Cowboy?

04:21.458 --> 04:23.993
Yeah, but right now
I'm the Gangster of Loaves.

04:24.027 --> 04:25.428
Ooh...

04:25.462 --> 04:27.530
Good one, Mitch!
They get funnier every time.

04:27.564 --> 04:29.331
It's a little buggy in produce.

04:29.366 --> 04:31.083
Yeah, turns out flies like fruit.

04:31.118 --> 04:32.968
Thanks for pointing that out, though.

04:33.003 --> 04:34.520
MORT: <i>How you gonna get
by without Linda, Bob?</i>

04:34.571 --> 04:36.922
She's only working
part-time. I'll be fine.

04:36.957 --> 04:38.624
Did Linda show you how
to work the thermostat?

04:38.658 --> 04:40.126
It's the same as it always is.

04:40.160 --> 04:41.761
No.

04:41.795 --> 04:43.462
Linda accounts for outside
temperature, grill temperature,

04:43.497 --> 04:44.864
the number of customers in here.

04:44.898 --> 04:46.932
Linda can play that
thermostat like a violin.

04:46.967 --> 04:49.435
Now that you mention it,
I do feel a little shvitzy.

04:49.469 --> 04:50.853
Oh, me, too.
Shirt's coming off.

04:50.887 --> 04:52.838
Fine, I'll turn it down.

04:52.873 --> 04:54.457
That's not how Linda does it, Bobby.

04:54.491 --> 04:56.358
You overshot it.
Now we're all gonna freeze.

04:56.393 --> 04:57.727
What are you talking about?

04:57.761 --> 04:58.994
I moved it, like, two degrees, Teddy.

04:59.029 --> 05:00.196
Two degrees is everything.

05:00.230 --> 05:01.464
Two degrees killed the dinosaurs!

05:01.498 --> 05:02.681
Fine! I'll
move it back!

05:02.716 --> 05:03.983
Too far again.

05:04.017 --> 05:05.985
(groans)
That's got to come off! Aah!

05:06.019 --> 05:07.987
We're gonna start you off
nice and easy today.

05:08.021 --> 05:09.382
On the ten-items-
or-less register.

05:09.389 --> 05:11.507
If they have 11, ban 'em or scan 'em.

05:11.541 --> 05:12.825
Your call.

05:12.859 --> 05:15.027
Oh, my call! Okay.
I'm in charge.

05:15.061 --> 05:16.529
To a point.

05:16.563 --> 05:19.698
Excuse me, did someone lose a monkey?

05:19.733 --> 05:21.333
(both chuckle)

05:21.368 --> 05:23.135
You're gonna do just fine here.

05:23.170 --> 05:24.503
Hey, with Linda gone,

05:24.538 --> 05:26.372
we can get into some
raunchy locker room talk.

05:26.406 --> 05:28.674
Hey, let's describe our
testicles with a movie title.

05:28.708 --> 05:29.708
(laughs) BOB: What?

05:29.743 --> 05:31.076
<i>The Wild Bunch!</i>

05:31.111 --> 05:32.878
Wait a minute.
What are we doing?

05:32.913 --> 05:34.213
<i>One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.</i>

05:34.247 --> 05:36.348
(laughs) You have one testicle?

05:36.383 --> 05:37.733
You knew that.
(door opens)

05:37.768 --> 05:39.585
Hey, Bob. Whoa.
It's warm in here.

05:39.619 --> 05:41.253
Yes, I know, Mike.
Thanks.

05:41.288 --> 05:42.688
Linda got a
part-time job.

05:42.722 --> 05:44.056
Teddy, you're looking good.

05:44.090 --> 05:45.391
Uh... I don't know.

05:45.425 --> 05:47.092
You got a lot of bills here.

05:47.127 --> 05:48.360
It's all bills.

05:48.395 --> 05:49.678
You guys should pay your bills.

05:49.713 --> 05:50.946
Mike's smart.
Yup.

05:50.981 --> 05:52.598
Hey, we're doing locker room talk.

05:52.632 --> 05:54.934
Tell us about your testicles. Good-bye.

my home family

06:11.468 --> 06:13.269

Go ahead with the tour, Mother.

06:20.744 --> 06:22.578
I'm going to visit with James.

That's right, I'm part of
the Fresh Feed family now,

06:24.748 --> 06:26.048
so don't bother with the toothpicks.

Actually, I would like many balloons.

06:34.991 --> 06:37.126
I'm gonna do something
I should've done years ago.

06:37.160 --> 06:38.777
I was hoping you could take me

06:38.812 --> 06:40.646
on a tour of the dairy fridge.

06:40.680 --> 06:43.132
Oh, yeah. Sure, honey.
Yeah. Come on.

06:43.166 --> 06:44.600
(humming)

06:44.634 --> 06:47.269
Ooh! Go! Be free!

06:47.304 --> 06:48.737
You'll float for a few days!

06:48.772 --> 06:50.906
Maybe a week. Who knows?

06:50.941 --> 06:53.442
But you'll live. You'll live!

06:53.476 --> 06:57.162
Wow. It's like I'm backstage
at a Broadway show...

06:57.197 --> 06:59.098
about people who buy milk.

06:59.132 --> 07:01.066
Ooh, I'd see that
show-- sort of.

07:01.101 --> 07:03.168
Hey, Linda, grab a mop, will you?

07:03.203 --> 07:04.637
Aisle three's got
a spill-a-roosh.

07:04.671 --> 07:06.572
Will do-a-roosh.
That's fun.

07:06.606 --> 07:08.123
Okay, I'll be right back, honey.

07:08.141 --> 07:10.609
No hurry.

07:10.644 --> 07:12.961
What if I put that hand on that arm?

07:12.979 --> 07:15.247
And those hips on those legs?

07:15.282 --> 07:17.766
Come on, Tina, don't play God.
It's dangerous.

07:17.801 --> 07:19.685
Oh, that hand is so handsome.

07:19.719 --> 07:21.587
BOY: What? What?

07:21.621 --> 07:24.256
Is someone back there? Maybe.
How'd you hurt your finger?

07:24.291 --> 07:26.425
My turtle bit me.
Oh, no.

07:26.459 --> 07:28.459
Ah, I was being a jerk.
He was just being a turtle.

07:28.461 --> 07:29.495
How old are you?

07:29.529 --> 07:30.963
I'm, um...

07:30.997 --> 07:33.299
How old are you?
Uh, you first.

07:33.333 --> 07:36.035
We'll say it at the same time.
One, two...

07:36.069 --> 07:37.036

07:38.138 --> 07:40.005
No, 13.
No, 14.

07:40.040 --> 07:41.040
Cool!

07:41.074 --> 07:42.608
So... you like chocolate milk?

07:42.642 --> 07:44.710
Yes. No.

07:44.744 --> 07:45.978
But... yes.

07:46.012 --> 07:47.479
You sound complicated.

07:47.514 --> 07:49.548
Well, I like it,
but my body doesn't like it.

07:49.583 --> 07:51.617
So I'm trying to train my body
to like it.

07:51.651 --> 07:52.885
You're brave.

07:52.919 --> 07:54.320
No. I'm lactose
intolerant.

07:54.354 --> 07:55.888
(sighs) Labels.
(phone buzzes)

07:55.922 --> 07:57.556
Ah. Mom's texting me.
I got to go.

07:57.591 --> 08:00.659
Wait! What's your name?
Or number? Or measurements?

08:00.694 --> 08:02.227
He's gone...

08:02.262 --> 08:04.313
(sniffs) but not forgotten.

08:04.347 --> 08:06.682
I'm going to use this to find him.

08:06.716 --> 08:08.717
I'm looking for a boy with a turtle bite

08:08.752 --> 08:10.152
on his index finger.

08:10.186 --> 08:11.804
Isn't every woman?

08:11.838 --> 08:13.973
So, did, uh...
did your mom mention

08:14.007 --> 08:15.424
anything about missing the restaurant?

08:15.458 --> 08:17.359
No, she seems happy at Fresh Feed.

08:17.394 --> 08:19.061
But maybe I just think that

08:19.095 --> 08:21.263
because she kept saying
how happy she is.

08:21.298 --> 08:22.865
Let her live a little, Dad.

08:22.899 --> 08:24.733
She's only been off leash one day.

08:24.768 --> 08:26.535
Yeah, give the woman

It's so great here.

Hello, my family.
Oh, God, it's hot.

Guess who aced her first
performance review!

Listen, Lin, uh,
I want to say something.

09:39.943 --> 09:41.343
Are you gonna say

09:41.378 --> 09:43.579
that I got all A's on my report card?

09:43.613 --> 09:44.947
In all Fresh Feed areas?

09:44.981 --> 09:46.832
Report cards at work?
Really?

09:46.866 --> 09:50.119
Yeah, I aced my first week.
They want me to go full-time.

09:50.153 --> 09:51.353
Shift manager.

09:51.388 --> 09:52.938
You're not gonna take it, right?

09:52.972 --> 09:55.357
No, it's just nice
that they appreciate me there.

09:55.392 --> 09:57.192
That's all.
Oh, come on, Lin.

09:57.227 --> 09:58.494
You're feeling underappreciated here?

09:58.528 --> 09:59.862
A little bit.

09:59.896 --> 10:01.163
What, do you want me

10:01.197 --> 10:02.431
to give you a performance review?

10:02.465 --> 10:03.932
That would be a nice start, Bob.

10:03.967 --> 10:06.268
(laughing): Hold on, hold
on, let me get comfy.

10:06.302 --> 10:07.803
And... evaluate your wife.

10:07.837 --> 10:10.706
Okay. Uh, Linda, you
clean the bathroom well.

10:10.740 --> 10:12.274
Okay.
And you know how

10:12.308 --> 10:14.843
to restock a napkin dispenser. All right.

10:14.878 --> 10:17.146
But you're on the phone
sometimes when you shouldn't be.

10:17.180 --> 10:18.213
Ooh.

10:18.248 --> 10:19.481
And you don't wear a hairnet

10:19.516 --> 10:21.016
and you hair falls out a lot.

10:21.051 --> 10:22.351
What?!

10:22.385 --> 10:23.786
And you're always sneaking pickles!

10:23.820 --> 10:25.854
But you are, um...
Come on, Dad.

10:25.889 --> 10:27.322
You've got this, Dad.

10:27.357 --> 10:28.957
You're sometimes friendly to people.

10:28.992 --> 10:30.659
Oh! Mom, huh?!
Yeah.

10:30.693 --> 10:32.528
That's nice.
Not enjoying this.

10:32.562 --> 10:33.802
Uh, but you're...
Anything else?

10:33.830 --> 10:35.030
...your hands are
often dirty.

10:35.065 --> 10:36.832
So, you get an eight out of ten.

10:36.866 --> 10:38.667
Well, maybe a 7.5.
What?!

10:38.685 --> 10:40.986
No, eight. Definitely
an eight out of ten.

10:41.020 --> 10:43.122
Eight out of ten?!
Well, Fresh Feed loves me!

10:43.156 --> 10:45.457
They gave me a locker.
A locker, Bob!

10:45.492 --> 10:47.326
Maybe I should go full-time!

10:47.360 --> 10:49.862
Great. Have fun with your locker
and your report cards

10:49.896 --> 10:52.164
and your Steve Miller Band cover bands.

10:52.198 --> 10:54.399
They have a name!
The Abracadabblers.

10:54.434 --> 10:56.168
I will have fun!
Because it's fun there!

10:56.202 --> 10:58.003
Then go ahead, Lin.

10:58.037 --> 11:00.372
If you don't want to be here,
then don't be here!

11:00.406 --> 11:02.141
We'll be fine without you! Okay, I will!

11:02.175 --> 11:03.575
I'm a full-time
Fresh Feeder!

11:03.626 --> 11:05.527
And here's a review for you!

11:05.545 --> 11:07.896
(blowing raspberries)

11:07.931 --> 11:11.049
Uh, Dad's gonna need your gun
and your badge, too, Mom.

11:11.084 --> 11:14.419
I get her apron because it still
smells like her and I like it

11:14.454 --> 11:16.421
because I'm 11 and I still like Mom.

11:16.456 --> 11:17.790
(blowing raspberries)

11:20.490 --> 11:22.374
Okay, kids, I'll see you tonight.

11:22.433 --> 11:23.766
I'm working a full day today.

11:23.801 --> 11:25.368
Bye, Mom. I'll probably
see you later

11:25.402 --> 11:27.670
when I swing by to hang out
in the milk fridge.

11:27.705 --> 11:29.372
Sorry, kids. You can't
go to Fresh Feed.

11:29.406 --> 11:30.773
I need you here.

11:30.808 --> 11:32.108
No!

11:32.142 --> 11:33.382
Your father's right, my babies.

11:33.410 --> 11:34.878
You better stay here.

11:34.912 --> 11:36.179
'Cause he's a disaster without me.

11:36.213 --> 11:37.213
No, I'm not.

11:37.248 --> 11:39.048
I'm kidding. You're not.

11:39.083 --> 11:41.284
No...

11:41.318 --> 11:42.552
Yes, you are! BOB: I didn't...

11:42.586 --> 11:43.786
I... (grunts)

11:45.289 --> 11:46.723
All right, Linda,

11:46.757 --> 11:48.491
here are the keys to the kingdom.

11:48.525 --> 11:50.226
Oof. Ten pounds of keys.

11:50.261 --> 11:51.828
Ten pounds of fun!

11:51.862 --> 11:54.030
You all set for your first
day as shift manager?

11:54.064 --> 11:56.432
You bet! I've got
my shift together.

11:56.467 --> 11:58.534
Great! If you need me,
I'll be in Bog Harbor

11:58.569 --> 11:59.869
with my fellow kiters.

11:59.904 --> 12:02.538
And I just mighters see you tonighters.

12:02.573 --> 12:04.207
Hey, Greg, go fly a kite.

12:04.241 --> 12:06.476

That's what he does.

12:06.510 --> 12:08.511
That's his hobby. Uh, I need quarters.

12:08.545 --> 12:10.546

12:24.278 --> 12:26.112
Uh, okay.
What do you say

12:26.146 --> 12:28.064

nobody ever said I rock at my old job,

12:39.009 --> 12:41.811

with the boss. (laughs)

12:41.845 --> 12:43.813

Hey, Linda, I need to pick up my kids

12:47.651 --> 12:49.018

Little strapped?

15:43.043 --> 15:44.977
Bob, you said you were,
like, double overdrawn.

15:45.012 --> 15:46.345
Little strapped!

15:46.380 --> 15:48.748
Teddy, shush! Shh, yeah, right.

15:48.782 --> 15:50.149
(dial tone) Oh, he hung up.

15:50.184 --> 15:51.617
Guess that means no meat, huh?

15:51.652 --> 15:53.853
Big day for
fries. Right?

15:53.887 --> 15:56.189
(sighs) Linda has this crazy
system for our finances.

15:56.223 --> 15:57.490
I forgot to make the deposit,

15:57.524 --> 16:00.326
and we got checks out
all over the place.

16:00.360 --> 16:02.094
Including the power company.

16:02.129 --> 16:03.763
Doesn't matter.
You don't have any food.

16:03.797 --> 16:05.598
You know, this kind of
makes me want to loot you.

16:05.632 --> 16:06.866
What?
Never mind.

16:06.900 --> 16:08.201
This isn't working.

16:08.235 --> 16:10.036
I'm gonna go get Linda.
I'm closing.

16:10.070 --> 16:12.138
You got to go, Teddy.
What? Why?

16:12.172 --> 16:13.606
It's dark.
There's no food.

16:13.640 --> 16:14.841
There's nothing here for you.

16:14.875 --> 16:16.542
That's okay.
Go on! Scat!

16:16.577 --> 16:18.444
Bob-a-do, bob-a-do,
bob-a-do, bop bop bop...

16:18.478 --> 16:20.513
No, not...I mean...
Scatty batty batty boop bop...

16:20.547 --> 16:21.948
I meant "go,"
not "scat."

16:21.982 --> 16:23.216
Go! Go!
No!

16:23.250 --> 16:23.895
Where am I supposed to go?

16:24.015 --> 16:25.023
Shoo!
(groans)

16:25.143 --> 16:26.073
Get out, Teddy!
(growls)

16:26.193 --> 16:27.529
Aah! Aah!
(growls)

16:27.649 --> 16:29.550
Get out!
So I should go?

16:32.612 --> 16:33.413
LINDA:
H-How are you?

16:33.438 --> 16:34.671
Nice day?
Find everything all right?

16:34.706 --> 16:36.073
Good, good. Okay.

16:36.107 --> 16:37.508
Fresh Feed?
More like Long Wait.

16:37.542 --> 16:39.343
Get it?
Okay, here's your receipt.

16:39.377 --> 16:40.844
Next in line! Next!

16:40.879 --> 16:43.013
Hey, careful with the eggs, huh?

16:43.047 --> 16:44.214
This is careful.

16:44.249 --> 16:45.649
Want to see loosey-goosey?

16:45.683 --> 16:48.018
Um, a pyramid of
grapefruits fell on a lady.

16:48.052 --> 16:49.820
I think she's trapped.
What?

16:49.854 --> 16:52.789
Uh, Gene, you've just been
promoted to register!

16:52.824 --> 16:54.725
Uh...
My first promotion!

16:54.759 --> 16:56.193
Watch out, glass ceiling!

16:56.227 --> 16:57.528
What are we looking at here?

16:57.562 --> 16:59.396
Mmm... bananas.
What is that, chicken?

16:59.430 --> 17:00.898
Let's just say 30 bucks.

17:00.932 --> 17:02.699
30 bucks?
Okay, five bucks.

17:02.734 --> 17:04.367
Sorry. Guh.

17:04.402 --> 17:05.636
Next!

17:05.670 --> 17:07.905
Ooh, someone likes pasta.

17:07.939 --> 17:09.373
(humming)

17:09.406 --> 17:11.290
Dollar whiskey, dollar scotch,

17:11.326 --> 17:13.410
dollar bourbon, dollar crotch.

17:13.444 --> 17:14.711
Hey!

17:14.746 --> 17:17.214
Great prices!
Wish I still drank!

17:17.248 --> 17:19.650
(loud chatter)

17:19.684 --> 17:21.417
What the hell is going on here?

17:21.452 --> 17:23.020
Gene, where's your mother?

17:23.054 --> 17:24.788
She's... around here somewhere.

17:24.821 --> 17:26.089
Might want to check poultry.

17:26.124 --> 17:27.925
(people shouting, grunting)

17:29.827 --> 17:31.345
Does this thing work?

17:31.379 --> 17:33.213
I don't know.
It's my first day here.

17:34.482 --> 17:35.949
Linda? It's Bob.

17:35.984 --> 17:36.950
Wh-What?

17:36.985 --> 17:38.518
Listen, Lin, I'm sorry

17:38.553 --> 17:40.187
I acted like I didn't need you.

17:40.221 --> 17:41.588
Of course I need you.

17:41.623 --> 17:43.257
I can't run the restaurant by myself.

17:43.291 --> 17:44.558
Hey, can you ring me up?

17:44.592 --> 17:45.692
No, I don't work here.

17:45.727 --> 17:47.060
So, Linda, listen...

17:47.095 --> 17:48.528
Come on. I have one item. Just take it.

17:48.563 --> 17:50.197
Hey, this guy's letting us take stuff!

17:50.231 --> 17:51.565
Free aisle!

17:51.599 --> 17:52.966
All right, I'm going on break.

17:53.001 --> 17:55.736
So, what I really want to tell you is...

17:55.770 --> 17:57.754
you make it fun
to work at the restaurant.

17:57.789 --> 18:00.440
I'd rather be scraping by together

18:00.475 --> 18:03.143
than have extra money and be apart.

18:03.194 --> 18:05.646
But I understand if you
want to try this new life out.

18:05.680 --> 18:07.931
I mean... I don't
really see the appeal--

18:07.966 --> 18:09.449
it's a pretty nasty market--

18:09.484 --> 18:12.586
but if it makes you happy,
then it makes me happy.

18:12.620 --> 18:13.854
Hey, come on.
That's too much.

18:14.922 --> 18:16.490
Oh, Bob, it's awful here.

18:16.524 --> 18:17.924
This is just a job.

18:17.959 --> 18:19.559
Everyone who works here
just wants to leave.

18:19.594 --> 18:21.595
I hate it, and I hate the customers.

18:21.629 --> 18:23.163
I'm sorry.
I know you people can hear me.

18:23.197 --> 18:24.498
I just hate it.

18:24.532 --> 18:26.266
Yeah, it's called a microphone.

18:26.301 --> 18:28.568
She told me she hates you the most. What?

18:28.603 --> 18:32.005
Bobby, I want to come back to
the restaurant. Oh, Lin...

18:32.040 --> 18:33.640
Meet me at register five.

18:33.675 --> 18:35.042
I'm on my way!

18:41.049 --> 18:42.015
Oh, Linda.

18:42.050 --> 18:43.066
Oh, Bob.

18:44.485 --> 18:45.952
Oh!
Oof, shrimp.

18:45.987 --> 18:47.754
(gags, coughs) It's happening!

18:47.789 --> 18:50.290
What?
Louise, what did you do?

18:50.325 --> 18:51.792
I made it rain shrimp.

18:51.826 --> 18:53.476
What'd you ever do?

18:53.494 --> 18:55.696
Get underneath them!
They're self-dipping!

18:57.332 --> 18:58.865
TINA:
<i>Give up, Tina.a.</i>

18:58.900 --> 19:01.034
<i>You're cold and lonely.</i>

19:01.069 --> 19:03.070
<i>And you shouldn't have drank</i>
<i>that gallon of milk.</i>

19:03.104 --> 19:04.371
(gasps)

19:04.405 --> 19:05.972
Hi. I'm Tina
from the fridge.

19:06.007 --> 19:08.241
Can I see your index finger?
Nothing weird.

19:12.096 --> 19:13.497
It fits. Is it you?

19:13.531 --> 19:14.498
Did you come back?

19:14.532 --> 19:16.400
I did. Every day this week.

19:16.434 --> 19:17.868
For me or the milk?

19:17.902 --> 19:19.836
For both.
I can't stop thinking about you.

19:19.871 --> 19:21.304
I want to meet face-to-face.

19:21.339 --> 19:22.539
I-I don't know.

19:22.573 --> 19:24.007
What if we ruin what we have?

19:24.042 --> 19:25.642
Shh, shh.
Don't say that.

19:25.677 --> 19:26.877
I can't reach.
Here.

19:26.911 --> 19:28.512
Shh.
Thank you.

19:28.546 --> 19:30.230
Take a chance for once in your life.

19:30.281 --> 19:32.348
If it doesn't work out,
we'll always have the milk.

19:34.218 --> 19:35.519
I'm coming out.
(grunts)

19:38.923 --> 19:40.190
(grunts)

19:40.224 --> 19:41.692
I'm stuck.

19:41.726 --> 19:43.260
I know you can't see
the other half of me,

19:43.294 --> 19:44.728
but trust me, it's there.

19:44.762 --> 19:46.229
(chanting):
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

19:46.264 --> 19:48.598
Kiss! Kiss!
Kiss! Kiss!

19:50.001 --> 19:51.234
(sighs)

19:51.269 --> 19:52.502
Wow.

19:52.537 --> 19:54.571
I'm Josh.
Joshua...

19:56.040 --> 19:57.507
BOB:
What's Tina doing?

19:57.542 --> 19:58.912
Tina, stop kissing strange boys
in the dairy fridge.

19:58.946 --> 20:00.180
We're going home!

20:00.214 --> 20:01.415
I have to go.

20:01.449 --> 20:03.083
Here's a bunch of numbers.

20:03.117 --> 20:04.818
They may look random, but
they're my phone number.

20:04.852 --> 20:06.903
Cool. They look like
they're in a good order.

20:06.938 --> 20:08.488
Oh, hey, Linda.
(chuckles)

20:08.522 --> 20:10.724
The strings were tight today, boy.

20:10.758 --> 20:11.992
Everything good here?

20:12.026 --> 20:13.226
Hi, Greg.

20:13.261 --> 20:14.828
Thanks for taking a chance on me.

20:14.862 --> 20:16.496
I quit, but don't let
that influence hiring

20:16.531 --> 20:17.497
other pre-middle-age
mothers.

20:17.532 --> 20:18.732
Okay, thanks, bye.

20:18.766 --> 20:20.700
What? I...

20:20.735 --> 20:21.768
(gasps)

20:21.803 --> 20:23.403
GREG:
Hey!

20:23.438 --> 20:24.754
Well, I guess, now that

20:24.789 --> 20:26.239
I don't work at Fresh Feed anymore,

20:26.274 --> 20:27.841
we're back to scrimping and saving.

20:27.875 --> 20:30.343
Maybe we can find other ways
to make some extra money.

20:30.378 --> 20:32.750
LOUISE: If there's one thing
I know, it's that sex sells.

20:32.870 --> 20:34.890
So all we have to do
is find some sex and sell it.
