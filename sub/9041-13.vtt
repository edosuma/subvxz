WEBVTT

00:04.533 --> 00:07.667
- OH, MY GOD.
YOU HAVE ANTS HERE TOO, DEBRA.

00:07.667 --> 00:08.833
- I KNOW, MARIE.

00:08.833 --> 00:10.967
YOU SON KEEPS LEAVING FOOD OUT.

00:10.967 --> 00:12.600
RAY, CAN YOU COME HERE?

00:12.600 --> 00:17.167
- THEY SEEM TO LIKE
YOUR MEAT LOAF, DEAR.

00:17.167 --> 00:18.867
- WHAT?
WHAT'S UP?

00:18.867 --> 00:20.433
- MORE ANTS.
- OH.

00:20.433 --> 00:22.400
- JUST SO YOU KNOW,
I'M CALLING THE EXTERMINATOR.

00:22.400 --> 00:25.233
- OH, NO, I HATE THAT GUY
AND HIS CHEMICALS.

00:25.233 --> 00:29.233
THE COUNTER TASTED FUNNY AFTER
HE LEFT LAST TIME.

00:29.233 --> 00:32.100
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING
LICKING THE COUNTER?

00:32.100 --> 00:34.500
- I SAW SOMETHING
THAT LOOKED LIKE JELLY.

00:41.233 --> 00:43.533
- I'M GONNA TRY
TO GET HIM HERE ON MONDAY.

00:43.533 --> 00:44.767
- OH.

00:44.767 --> 00:46.733
- IN THE MEANTIME,
THESE ANTS COULD MAYBE LEAD YOU

00:46.733 --> 00:50.167
TO THE OTHER CRUMBS
IN THE HOUSE.

00:50.167 --> 00:51.900
- LISTEN, WHY DON'T YOU
ROUND UP THE KIDS, HUH?

00:51.900 --> 00:53.667
I DON'T FEEL LIKE
GETTING ANY MORE FOOD OUT,

00:53.667 --> 00:55.400
SO WE'LL TAKE THEM
TO MARCO'S FOR DINNER.

00:55.400 --> 00:58.200
- COME ON, DON'T MAKE THIS
INTO A WHOLE THING!

00:58.200 --> 01:00.700
- THE KITCHEN
IS COVERED IN ANTS.

01:00.700 --> 01:02.767
- BUT YOU KNOW THE KIDS
AND RESTAURANTS.

01:02.767 --> 01:05.100
COME ON.
LOOK, IT'S LATE, THEY'RE TIRED.

01:05.100 --> 01:08.000
THEY'RE GONNA BE FIGHTING.
FOOD'S GONNA BE EVERYWHERE.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.900
I SAY WE EAT
IN FRONT OF THE TV,

01:09.900 --> 01:12.500
LIKE A REGULAR FAMILY.

01:12.500 --> 01:15.500
- SO WE CAN NEVER TAKE
THE KIDS TO A RESTAURANT?

01:15.500 --> 01:18.367
- WE CAN GO WHEN
THEY CAN DRIVE US.

01:18.367 --> 01:21.733
WAIT, HOW 'BOUT
WE GO TO MARCO'S, HUH?

01:21.733 --> 01:23.267
JUST THE TWO OF US.

01:23.267 --> 01:25.433
MA, CAN YOU TAKE THE KIDS
TO YOUR HOUSE FOR DINNER?

01:25.433 --> 01:28.033
SURE, THEY COULD USE
A HOME-COOKED MEAL.

01:31.100 --> 01:33.200
- IT'S OKAY, MARIE.

01:33.200 --> 01:34.667
- NO, NO! COME ON!
IT'LL BE FUN, HUH?

01:34.667 --> 01:36.700
JUST YOU AND ME.
LIKE WHEN WE WERE DATING.

01:36.700 --> 01:38.867
EXCEPT NOW I KNOW
NOT TO EXPECT SEX AFTER.

01:38.867 --> 01:41.000
HA, HA, HA!

01:43.367 --> 01:46.533
- I DON'T LIKE THAT, RAYMOND.

01:46.533 --> 01:49.100
- OKAY. COME ON, KIDS.
GET YOUR COATS ON.

01:49.100 --> 01:50.500
WE'RE GOING OUT TO EAT.

01:50.500 --> 01:54.167
- YIPPEE!

01:54.167 --> 01:55.667
- YOU READY, RAY?

02:01.400 --> 02:03.100
OKAY,
BYE, MARIE.

02:03.100 --> 02:06.067
DON'T BOTHER TO CLEAN UP.
I'LL GET TO IT LATER.

02:07.233 --> 02:09.633
- SHE'LL GET TO IT LATER.

02:11.067 --> 02:13.500
EVEN THE ANTS ARE LAUGHING.

02:17.333 --> 02:19.033
[yelling and screaming]

02:19.033 --> 02:21.533
- STOP IT!
STOP!

02:21.533 --> 02:27.533
Debra: HEY, HEY!
YOUR FATHER SAID STOP!

02:27.533 --> 02:29.600
IN FIVE MINUTES,
I'M COMING UP THERE,

02:29.600 --> 02:31.733
AND WHOEVER'S NOT IN BED
GETS NO CANDY

02:31.733 --> 02:33.733
UNTIL THEY'RE 30!

02:39.200 --> 02:40.633
OH, MY GOD.

02:40.633 --> 02:41.700
- JUST WHEN YOU THOUGHT

02:41.700 --> 02:43.567
IT COULDN'T POSSIBLY
GET ANY LOUDER,

02:43.567 --> 02:46.100
THEY FIND THEIR WHISTLES
IN THE CAR.

02:50.167 --> 02:52.667
YOU GOT SOME SPAGHETTI
IN YOUR HAIR.

02:56.767 --> 03:00.000
OH...WHAT A NIGHTMARE.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.733
- I GUESS I BETTER
GET UP THERE, HUH?

03:01.733 --> 03:05.433
- ALMOST CAN'T THINK OF A TIME
WHEN THE KIDS BEHAVED WORSE!

03:07.967 --> 03:09.667
MAYBE THAT ONE TIME, UH,
AT THE LAKE

03:09.667 --> 03:14.433
WHEN GEOFFREY TRIED
TO RIDE A GOOSE.

03:14.433 --> 03:16.133
NO. NO.

03:16.133 --> 03:20.233
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THIS WAS WORSE.

03:20.233 --> 03:23.733
YEP! A BAD NIGHT.

03:26.533 --> 03:29.200
WELL, AT LEAST WE GOT
CHOCOLATE CAKE OUT OF IT.

03:29.200 --> 03:31.300
I LOVE CHOCOLATE CAKE.

03:31.300 --> 03:34.900
- YOU GOT SOMETHING
YOU WANT TO SAY, RAY?

03:34.900 --> 03:36.533
- HMM? WHAT'S THAT, NOW?

03:38.500 --> 03:40.233
YOU GOT SOMETHING
YOU WANT TO SAY TO ME

03:40.233 --> 03:41.767
ABOUT GOING OUT TONIGHT?

03:41.767 --> 03:46.233
- NO...I DON'T THINK SO.

03:48.967 --> 03:50.733
I PRETTY MUCH SAID
ALL I HAD TO SAY

03:50.733 --> 03:52.200
BEFORE WE WENT THERE.

03:55.333 --> 03:57.433
- WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?

03:57.433 --> 04:00.000
- NO PROBLEM; IT'S JUST
I HAD ANOTHER PLAN FOR TONIGHT,

04:00.000 --> 04:01.900
AND YOU REJECTED IT,
AND NOW...

04:01.900 --> 04:05.033
DID YOU GET WHAT YOU WANTED?

04:13.933 --> 04:15.333
- I HOPE YOU'RE ENJOYING THAT,

04:15.333 --> 04:18.300
BECAUSE THAT'S GOING TO BE
YOUR LAST MEAL.

04:18.300 --> 04:19.867
- I'M NOT SCARED.

04:19.867 --> 04:23.033
WHAT HAPPENED TONIGHT
CAUSED ME TO HAVE A REVELATION.

04:23.033 --> 04:24.800
- WHICH WAS WHAT?

04:24.800 --> 04:27.467
- THAT I'M ALWAYS THE ONE WHO
HAS TO BACK DOWN AROUND HERE.

04:27.467 --> 04:31.033
I CONSTANTLY HAVE TO SHUT
MY MOUTH TO KEEP THE PEACE.

04:31.033 --> 04:32.500
- EXCUSE ME?

04:41.233 --> 04:42.500
- THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.

04:42.500 --> 04:43.933
YOU'RE GOING TO ACT
LIKE A BIG BABY

04:43.933 --> 04:46.000
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T
GET YOUR WAY TONIGHT?

04:46.000 --> 04:47.667
- TRY EVERY NIGHT, OKAY?

04:47.667 --> 04:49.800
I'M TALKING ABOUT
12 YEARS OF MARRIAGE NOW!

04:49.800 --> 04:52.733
YOU HAVE TO GET YOUR WAY
AT EVERYTHING, ALL THE TIME.

04:52.733 --> 04:54.733
- THAT IS NOT TRUE!

04:54.733 --> 04:56.167
- IT'S NOT TRUE?

04:56.167 --> 04:58.133
HOW ABOUT THE DOG
THAT I'VE ALWAYS WANTED?

04:58.133 --> 04:59.433
WAIT A MINUTE!

04:59.433 --> 05:01.000
IF YOU DON'T ALWAYS GET
WHAT YOU WANT,

05:01.000 --> 05:02.333
THEN I GUESS WE HAVE ONE.

05:02.333 --> 05:04.200
HEY, FLOPPY! HERE, BOY!

05:11.933 --> 05:12.933
- FLOPPY?

05:12.933 --> 05:14.600
- THAT'S RIGHT--FLOPPY.

05:14.600 --> 05:19.033
YOU CAN'T EVEN LET ME
NAME MY IMAGINARY DOG.

05:21.433 --> 05:24.167
- SO BECAUSE
WE DON'T HAVE A DOG,

05:24.167 --> 05:26.167
YOU NEVER GET YOUR WAY?

05:26.167 --> 05:27.433
- LOOK AROUND!

05:27.433 --> 05:29.000
EVERYTHING IN HERE
IS YOUR DECISION.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.200
THAT LAMP, THAT PAINTING.

05:30.200 --> 05:32.033
THE FLOWER DRAPES
OVER THE SINK.

05:32.033 --> 05:34.400
I HATE THOSE DRAPES.
LOOK, THEY'RE ONE PATTERN.

05:34.400 --> 05:36.600
AND THE WALL'S A TOTALLY
DIFFERENT PATTERN.

05:36.600 --> 05:39.400
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING
WITH THOSE DRAPES?

05:39.400 --> 05:41.500
- I DIDN'T HEAR
A PEEP OUT OF YOU

05:41.500 --> 05:44.067
WHEN WE WERE PICKING THEM OUT.

05:44.067 --> 05:46.633
- WELL, MAYBE YOU NEED
TO LISTEN BETTER.

05:48.333 --> 05:51.667
- I NEED TO LISTEN BETTER?

05:51.667 --> 05:54.300
[yelling]
I NEED TO LISTEN BETTER?

05:54.300 --> 05:56.233
- YES! YES!
BECAUSE I DID SAY SOMETHING.

05:56.233 --> 05:58.167
I SAID, "REALLY?
THOSE DRAPES?"

05:58.167 --> 06:00.733
AND WHAT DID YOU SAY?
I BELIEVE YOU SAID--

06:00.733 --> 06:02.033
LET ME SEE IF I REMEMBER.

06:02.033 --> 06:05.467
THAT'S RIGHT--
YOU SAID, "PFFT!"

06:05.467 --> 06:07.533
- THAT'S BECAUSE,
"REALLY? THOSE DRAPES?"

06:07.533 --> 06:08.767
DOESN'T HELP ME!

06:08.767 --> 06:09.867
YOU DON'T REALLY WANT

06:09.867 --> 06:11.233
TO BE INVOLVED
IN THE DECISION,

06:11.233 --> 06:13.233
YOU JUST WANT TO RESERVE
THE RIGHT TO COMPLAIN.

06:13.233 --> 06:15.433
- NO, YOU JUST
DON'T WANT MY OPINION!

06:15.433 --> 06:16.800
HOW ABOUT WITH THE COUCH?

06:16.800 --> 06:18.567
REMEMBER, I PICKED OUT
THAT REALLY COOL ONE

06:18.567 --> 06:21.800
WITH THE THREE
POP-UP FOOTRESTS.

06:21.800 --> 06:23.300
- THAT THING WAS ATROCIOUS!

06:23.300 --> 06:27.167
- IT WAS PERHAPS
THE BEST COUCH EVER!

06:27.167 --> 06:29.300
- SO THAT'S YOUR IDEA
OF DECISION-MAKING,

06:29.300 --> 06:32.733
A DOG NAMED "FLOPPY"
AND UNLIMITED FOOTRESTS?

06:32.733 --> 06:34.067
- NOT A BAD START.

06:34.067 --> 06:35.600
- I THINK
YOU'RE FORGETTING

06:35.600 --> 06:37.367
THAT I ALREADY LET YOU
MAKE DECISIONS, RAY,

06:37.367 --> 06:39.300
AND THEN YOU PROCEED
TO SCREW THEM UP!

06:39.300 --> 06:40.700
- I DON'T RECALL THAT.

06:47.667 --> 06:50.733
- LAST WEEK, I SENT YOU
FOR A SIMPLE GARDEN HOSE.

06:50.733 --> 06:52.400
YOU CAME HOME
WITH THAT TINY THING.

06:52.400 --> 06:53.900
IT'S TOTALLY USELESS.

06:53.900 --> 06:55.667
- WHAT? THAT'S A GOOD HOSE.

06:55.667 --> 06:56.867
- TWO FEET LONG?

06:56.867 --> 06:58.267
THE WATER DOESN'T
EVEN REACH THE PLANTS!

06:58.267 --> 07:00.167
- SO YOU SQUIRT IT
OVER THERE.

07:00.167 --> 07:02.667
USE YOUR THUMB,
THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE DO.

07:04.767 --> 07:07.433
- JUST SO YOU KNOW,
THAT HOSE IS GOIN' BACK.

07:07.433 --> 07:10.100
- OH...THAT'S IT RIGHT THERE.

07:10.100 --> 07:11.100
- WHAT?

07:11.100 --> 07:12.300
- THAT IS HOW YOU GET YOUR WAY.

07:12.300 --> 07:14.100
"JUST SO YOU KNOW."

07:14.100 --> 07:17.367
YEAH, YEAH.
"JUST SO YOU KNOW, RAY,

07:17.367 --> 07:18.867
"WE'RE GETTING
THE FLOWER DRAPES.

07:18.867 --> 07:20.367
"JUST SO YOU KNOW, RAY,

07:20.367 --> 07:22.400
"I ORDERED THE BORING COUCH
WITHOUT THE FOOTRESTS.

07:22.400 --> 07:24.400
"AND, RAY, WE'RE GOING TO
MOVE IN ACROSS THE STREET

07:24.400 --> 07:27.133
FROM YOUR PARENTS--
JUST SO YOU KNOW."

07:27.133 --> 07:29.100
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

07:29.100 --> 07:30.600
I REMEMBER SAYING, "NO, NO.

07:30.600 --> 07:35.267
IN THE NAME OF ALL
THAT IS HOLY, NO!"

07:35.267 --> 07:38.567
BUT LOOK WHERE WE ARE.

07:38.567 --> 07:41.767
NICE WORK!

07:41.767 --> 07:45.500
SORRY I'M COMING ON STRONG,
BUT THE TRUTH HAS SET ME FREE!

07:49.133 --> 07:50.467
- [sighs]

07:50.467 --> 07:52.467
SO YOU JUST WANT TO
MAKE MORE DECISIONS,

07:52.467 --> 07:53.500
IS THAT IT?

07:53.500 --> 07:55.733
- THAT'S ALL I'M SAYIN'.

07:55.733 --> 07:56.900
- NO.

07:56.900 --> 07:58.533
- WHAT? WHAT?

07:58.533 --> 08:00.200
- YOU GAVE UP THE RIGHT
TO MAKE DECISIONS AROUND HERE

08:00.200 --> 08:01.900
WHEN YOU STOPPED TAKING
ANY RESPONSIBILITY.

08:01.900 --> 08:04.733
YOU DON'T HELP ME AT ALL!
YOU CAN'T EVEN WASH A DISH!

08:04.733 --> 08:06.533
- MAYBE I'D WASH A DISH
IF I DIDN'T HAVE TO LOOK

08:06.533 --> 08:09.367
AT THOSE
REPULSIVE CURTAINS.

08:09.367 --> 08:10.667
- FINE, FINE.
YOU BE THAT WAY.

08:10.667 --> 08:12.267
BUT UNTIL YOU
START HELPIN' OUT,

08:12.267 --> 08:13.467
I'M MAKIN'
ALL THE DECISIONS.

08:13.467 --> 08:15.533
- BUT--
- GOOD NIGHT.

08:15.533 --> 08:17.533
- BUT YOU--
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

08:17.533 --> 08:19.900
WE'RE MARRIED.
IT'S A TWO-WAY STREET.

08:19.900 --> 08:21.167
- NO, IT'S NOT.

08:21.167 --> 08:23.433
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"NO, IT'S NOT"?

08:23.433 --> 08:25.833
MARRIAGE IS A TWO-WAY STREET.

08:25.833 --> 08:27.600
YOU CAN'T JUST MAKE IT
A ONE-WAY STREET.

08:27.600 --> 08:30.167
THINK OF ALL THE ACCIDENTS
YOU'RE CAUSIN'.

08:34.033 --> 08:36.100
NOT MAKING ANY DECISIONS--

08:36.100 --> 08:38.333
I'LL MAKE ALL THE DECISIONS
I WANT.

08:38.333 --> 08:40.433
MAYBE I'M DECIDING
TO SLEEP DOWN HERE TONIGHT.

08:40.433 --> 08:43.033
Debra: I ALREADY
MADE THAT DECISION!

08:46.567 --> 08:48.500
Debra:
JUST SO YOU KNOW!

09:04.700 --> 09:06.600
- HEY...
GOOD MORNING.

09:07.667 --> 09:09.433
- HUH?

09:11.533 --> 09:14.500
HEY. WHAT'S UP?

09:18.567 --> 09:20.833
- IS THAT THE NETTING
FROM OUR TENT?

09:20.833 --> 09:24.133
- YEAH, IT'S KEEPING
THE ANTS AWAY.

09:31.200 --> 09:32.800
- IT'S DETACHABLE?

09:32.800 --> 09:37.233
- IT CAME OFF.

09:37.233 --> 09:38.567
- LISTEN, UH...

09:38.567 --> 09:40.400
[sighs]

09:40.400 --> 09:42.733
I'M SORRY ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

09:42.733 --> 09:44.633
- YOU KNOW,
YOU BROUGHT SOMETHING UP,

09:44.633 --> 09:47.367
AND I SHOULDN'T HAVE
DISMISSED YOU LIKE THAT.

09:47.367 --> 09:48.767
I MEAN, YOU'RE RIGHT...

09:48.767 --> 09:54.667
SOMETIMES I DO JUST
DISREGARD YOUR OPINION.

09:54.667 --> 09:56.833
SOMETIMES
I MIGHT THINK WRONGLY

09:56.833 --> 10:01.933
THAT YOUR DECISION-MAKING
ABILITY IS SUSPECT--

10:01.933 --> 10:04.033
ARE YOU OKAY THERE?

10:04.033 --> 10:06.267
- YEAH, I'M ALL RIGHT.

10:08.033 --> 10:10.100
- ANYWAY, I APOLOGIZE.

10:11.767 --> 10:13.300
- OKAY, YEAH.

10:13.300 --> 10:16.300
I'M SORRY IF I WAS
A LITTLE JERKY LAST NIGHT TOO.

10:16.300 --> 10:20.000
THE CURTAINS ARE NOT
ACTUALLY REPULSIVE.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.367
- BUT YOU HAVE A POINT.

10:21.367 --> 10:23.433
JUST BECAUSE YOU WOULD
NAME A DOG "FLOPPY"

10:23.433 --> 10:27.500
DOESN'T MEAN YOU
SHOULDN'T GET A SAY.

10:27.500 --> 10:28.800
- REALLY?

10:28.800 --> 10:29.800
- YEAH.

10:29.800 --> 10:30.933
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

10:30.933 --> 10:33.400
WE HAVE A VACATION
COMING UP.

10:33.400 --> 10:35.467
WHY DON'T YOU DECIDE
WHERE WE GO?

10:35.467 --> 10:38.600
- ME? I DECIDE THE VACATION?

10:38.600 --> 10:39.667
- YEAH.

10:39.667 --> 10:41.133
- THE FAMILY VACATION?

10:41.133 --> 10:43.600
THAT'S BIG.

10:43.600 --> 10:45.767
- I TRUST YOU. I DO.

10:47.267 --> 10:49.400
I'M GOING TO
HAVE TO TRUST YOU.

10:59.367 --> 11:02.333
- [high-pitched singing]
YOU MAKE ME FEEL LIKE DANCIN'

11:02.333 --> 11:05.867
I WANNA DANCE
THE NIGHT AWAY

11:05.867 --> 11:07.400
HEY

11:08.867 --> 11:11.067
- HEY...WHAT'S ALL THAT?

11:11.067 --> 11:14.167
- YOU GOT FOOD IN THERE?
GIVE IT!

11:14.167 --> 11:15.867
- I GOT
ALL THESE TRAVEL BROCHURES

11:15.867 --> 11:17.367
FOR OUR VACATION I'M PLANNING.

11:17.367 --> 11:18.600
- WOW!

11:18.600 --> 11:21.233
- IT'S AMAZING.
THE WORLD HAS A LOT OF PLACES!

11:23.667 --> 11:25.167
- WHAT'S ALL THIS?
- NO, NO, NO...

11:25.167 --> 11:26.467
NO, NO, NO.

11:26.467 --> 11:28.300
YOU TOLD ME TO GET
SOME MILK AT THE STORE,

11:28.300 --> 11:30.500
AND, I THOUGHT,
'CAUSE I'M HELPING,

11:30.500 --> 11:34.067
THAT I WOULD GET SOME STUFF
THAT I WANTED TO GET.

11:34.067 --> 11:35.067
- OH...

11:35.067 --> 11:36.500
- YEAH. LET ME SHOW YOU.

11:38.600 --> 11:41.167
THIS IS FOR THE ANTS.
IT'S ALL NATURAL.

11:41.167 --> 11:43.000
MADE FROM SOME OIL
OR SOMETHING.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.400
YOU CAN SPRAY IT
WHEREVER YOU WANT.

11:44.400 --> 11:46.567
RAY! WATCH IT!
DON'T, DON'T!

11:46.567 --> 11:49.667
- NO, NO, IT'S MADE FROM,
LIKE, ORANGES OR SOMETHING.

11:49.667 --> 11:54.600
YOU SQUIRT IT ON A CRACKER,
YOU GOT YOURSELF A SNACK.

11:54.600 --> 11:55.567
- I'M IN!

11:57.800 --> 12:01.900
- SO I WAS THINKIN' WE COULD
CANCEL THE EXTERMINATOR.

12:01.900 --> 12:03.867
- IF YOU WANT TO GO AROUND

12:03.867 --> 12:06.233
AND SPRAY EVERY NOOK
AND CRANNY OF THIS HOUSE,

12:06.233 --> 12:08.600
THEN YOU CAN
CANCEL THE EXTERMINATOR.

12:08.600 --> 12:11.300
- HA-HA! I CAN DO THINGS.
I'M A THING-DOER.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.833
- HI. I MADE SANDWICHES.

12:15.833 --> 12:20.267
Frank: ENOUGH CHITCHAT, MARIE.
SANDWICHES!

12:20.267 --> 12:21.733
- HEY, MARIE,

12:21.733 --> 12:24.467
RAY WENT TO THE GROCERY STORE
ON HIS OWN!

12:24.467 --> 12:26.300
- YOU WENT SHOPPING
ON YOUR OWN?

12:26.300 --> 12:27.633
- NOT JUST GROCERIES.

12:27.633 --> 12:29.833
ALLY NEEDS A NOTEBOOK
FOR SCHOOL, RIGHT?

12:29.833 --> 12:30.933
SO HERE I AM HELPING.

12:30.933 --> 12:33.333
- OH, PURPLE.

12:33.333 --> 12:35.667
- LOOK, I FOUND THESE KITS
TO MAKE BOX KITES.

12:35.667 --> 12:36.767
TWO FOR $5.

12:36.767 --> 12:39.533
SO I THOUGHT THE TWINS
WOULD LIKE 'EM.

12:39.533 --> 12:41.333
PARKER'S KID HAD THEM
AT THE PLAYGROUND,

12:41.333 --> 12:45.600
BUT THESE ARE MUCH BIGGER.
HA-HA! PARKER!

12:45.600 --> 12:46.700
- YEAH, THESE ARE GREAT!

12:46.700 --> 12:48.833
- MA, COULD YOU BRING DAD
HIS SANDWICHES?

12:48.833 --> 12:52.267
HIS STOMACH JUST MADE A NOISE
I HEARD IN THE WOODS ONCE.

12:55.833 --> 12:57.133
- I'M SORRY, ROBERT.

12:57.133 --> 13:00.333
WE WERE WATCHING RAYMOND
UNLOAD GROCERIES.

13:00.333 --> 13:03.667
- AND NOBODY'S VIDEOTAPING?

13:03.667 --> 13:05.233
- ROBERT, PLEASE.

13:05.233 --> 13:07.067
KEEP GOING.
WHAT ELSE DID YOU GET?

13:07.067 --> 13:08.333
- I FOUND THESE
GREAT TISSUES ON SALE,

13:08.333 --> 13:09.433
SO I GOT TEN BOXES.

13:09.433 --> 13:11.100
- THAT'S A LOT OF TISSUES.

13:11.100 --> 13:13.800
- NOT ONLY WERE THEY ON SALE,
THERE WAS AN IN-STORE COUPON,

13:13.800 --> 13:16.000
SO IT WAS, LIKE, UNBELIEVABLE.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.033
- TELL US MORE
ABOUT THE TISSUES, RAY.

13:19.033 --> 13:21.067
- YEAH, OKAY.

13:21.067 --> 13:23.500
SURE.
YOU CAN MAKE FUN,

13:23.500 --> 13:27.000
BUT WE ARE SET FOR TISSUES.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.500
- SO YOU SAVED
SOME MONEY.

13:28.500 --> 13:31.800
- WHAT?
- WHAT? THEY'RE GOOD.

13:31.800 --> 13:33.233
WHAT ELSE YOU GOT?

13:33.233 --> 13:34.967
- WAIT, WHAT'S WRONG
WITH THE TISSUES?

13:34.967 --> 13:36.633
- NOTHING.
- NO, SOMETHING.

13:36.633 --> 13:38.700
- IT'S JUST I WOULDN'T HAVE
GOTTEN THOSE KIND

13:38.700 --> 13:40.567
'CAUSE THEY DON'T REALLY
GO WITH THE BATHROOM.

13:40.567 --> 13:42.300
BUT IT'S FINE.
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

13:42.300 --> 13:44.500
- HEH-HEH.
SHE HATES THE TISSUES.

13:46.000 --> 13:49.167
- OH, NO, THEY'RE TOTALLY FINE.
SO WHAT ELSE IS IN HERE?

13:49.167 --> 13:50.800
- WAIT, WAIT.
HOLD ON. HOLD ON. HOLD ON.

13:50.800 --> 13:52.900
MOM, WHAT DO YOU
THINK OF THESE?

13:52.900 --> 13:54.667
- WELL, I DON'T BUY THIS KIND.

13:54.667 --> 13:57.367
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THERE'S
ANYTHING WRONG WITH THEM.

13:57.367 --> 13:59.667
HOWEVER, I WOULD SAY
THAT ACCENTS LIKE TISSUES

13:59.667 --> 14:02.767
ARE ONE OF THE MOST
CRUCIAL DECISIONS

14:02.767 --> 14:05.500
IN THE LOOK AND CHARACTER
OF A HOUSEHOLD.

14:11.500 --> 14:15.267
- YOU DO REALIZE THAT PEOPLE
USE THEM TO BLOW THEIR NOSE?

14:16.800 --> 14:19.133
- YES, BUT BEFORE
THEY BLOW THEIR NOSE,

14:19.133 --> 14:23.633
THE RIGHT TISSUE BOX
INVITES THEM TO DO SO.

14:26.900 --> 14:28.233
- YEAH?

14:28.233 --> 14:32.300
OKAY, WELL,
I THINK THESE ARE INVITING.

14:32.300 --> 14:35.500
- WELL, YOU ARE ALONE.

14:35.500 --> 14:36.967
- SHUT UP.

14:36.967 --> 14:38.067
COME ON.
THEY'RE GOOD, RIGHT?

14:38.067 --> 14:39.300
- YEAH,
THEY'RE GREAT.

14:39.300 --> 14:41.300
- YOU DO HATE THEM,
DON'T YOU?

14:41.300 --> 14:42.967
- I--RAY, LOOK,
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

14:42.967 --> 14:45.700
I'LL JUST GET MY KIND
THE NEXT TIME I GO TO THE STORE.

14:45.700 --> 14:47.100
- WAIT. NO, NO, NO.

14:47.100 --> 14:49.933
I MADE THIS DECISION,
AND WE'RE STICKING WITH THIS.

14:49.933 --> 14:51.467
- IT'S NOT THAT BIG--

14:51.467 --> 14:54.367
- I'M SORRY, BUT I AM NOT
GONNA BACK DOWN HERE!

14:54.367 --> 14:56.400
- NOW WE GOT A SHOW!

15:05.000 --> 15:06.533
- I JUST THINK
THAT YOUR BATHROOM

15:06.533 --> 15:09.400
NEEDS AS MUCH HELP
AS IT CAN GET.

15:09.400 --> 15:11.700
- NO, THIS IS NOT ABOUT DEBRA
AND HER LOUSY HOUSEKEEPING.

15:11.700 --> 15:15.733
IT'S ABOUT ME
FINALLY GETTING SOME SAY!

15:15.733 --> 15:18.867
- RAYMOND, WHY ARE YOU
BEING SO STUBBORN?

15:18.867 --> 15:20.467
- LET'S NOT FORGET,
WHEN I WAS GROWING UP,

15:20.467 --> 15:22.267
YOU NEVER LET ME
MAKE ANY DECISIONS, EITHER!

15:22.267 --> 15:23.567
I WAS 15 YEARS OLD--

15:23.567 --> 15:25.200
YOU WERE STILL PICKING OUT
MY CLOTHES.

15:25.200 --> 15:26.567
- THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG

15:26.567 --> 15:28.200
WITH MY PUTTING TOGETHER
YOUR SPECIAL OUTFITS.

15:28.200 --> 15:30.667
- YEAH, MA, LET ME
TELL YOU SOMETHING.

15:30.667 --> 15:33.467
WHEN KIDS AT SCHOOL FIND OUT
YOU'RE WEARING AN OUTFIT,

15:33.467 --> 15:37.500
ALL THEY WANT TO DO
IS HIT YOU IN IT.

15:37.500 --> 15:39.467
- YOU JUST GIVE ME
THE NAMES OF THOSE KIDS--

15:39.467 --> 15:41.333
- I'M ALL GROWN-UP NOW, MA!

15:42.700 --> 15:44.533
ALL GROWN-UP!

15:45.900 --> 15:49.067
- AND LOOK HOW YOU DRESS.

15:49.067 --> 15:50.400
- YOU SEE?

15:50.400 --> 15:51.733
I STILL CAN'T
MAKE MY OWN DECISIONS.

15:51.733 --> 15:53.300
YOU NEVER LET ME!
AND YOU NEVER LET ME!

15:53.300 --> 15:54.700
YOU'RE BOTH THE SAME!

15:54.700 --> 15:56.600
- HEY!
- HEY!

15:56.600 --> 15:58.900
- GAME'S ALL OVER.
STILL NO SANDWICHES.

15:58.900 --> 16:01.033
OH...

16:02.233 --> 16:05.400
HEY, THOSE TISSUES STINK.

16:05.400 --> 16:07.033
- WHAT?

16:07.033 --> 16:10.500
- YEAH, THEY GOT
THE LOTION ON THEM.

16:11.967 --> 16:13.667
THEY'RE ALL GREASY.

16:13.667 --> 16:15.867
YOU PULL ONE OUT
TO BLOW YOUR NOSE ON IT,

16:15.867 --> 16:18.000
YOU THINK YOU DID IT ALREADY.

16:31.033 --> 16:32.300
- YEAH, RIGHT.

16:32.300 --> 16:35.567
KNOWING YOU, DAD,
YOU PROBABLY DID.

16:35.567 --> 16:37.967
- SERIOUSLY, THAT IS
A DISASTER OF A PRODUCT.

16:37.967 --> 16:39.300
- THESE TISSUES ARE FINE, DAD!

16:39.300 --> 16:42.033
THEY'RE FINE!
ALL RIGHT?

16:42.033 --> 16:43.633
- RAYMOND, IF I MAY...

16:43.633 --> 16:47.167
DID YOU EVER STOP TO WONDER WHY
THESE TISSUES WERE ON SALE?

16:47.167 --> 16:50.100
THE BAD COLOR,
THE DISGUSTING TEXTURE,

16:50.100 --> 16:52.367
THE FACT THAT
THEY'RE ONLY 100-COUNT

16:52.367 --> 16:56.867
WHEN A TYPICAL BOX
OF TISSUES HOLDS 160?

16:56.867 --> 16:58.367
HMM?

17:02.033 --> 17:04.900
YOU GOT RIPPED OFF,
MY BROTHER.

17:04.900 --> 17:06.733
NOBODY WANTED THESE THINGS.

17:06.733 --> 17:09.267
NOBODY BUT POOR OL'
MR. BUMBLEPUSS.

17:12.900 --> 17:14.267
THAT'S YOU.

17:16.400 --> 17:18.167
- ALL RIGHT,
EVERYBODY OUT!

17:18.167 --> 17:21.900
- RAYMOND, I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU'RE ACTING LIKE THIS.

17:21.900 --> 17:24.233
- YEAH, WE DIDN'T BUY
THE STUPID TISSUES.

17:24.233 --> 17:25.733
- BECAUSE THIS IS RIDICULOUS!

17:25.733 --> 17:27.133
I GET ONE THING I WANT,

17:27.133 --> 17:29.100
AND EVERYBODY'S GOT TO
JUMP ALL OVER ME!

17:29.100 --> 17:30.767
- GET SOMETHING BETTER
NEXT TIME.

17:30.767 --> 17:31.700
- GET OUT!

17:33.233 --> 17:34.900
- I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING.

17:34.900 --> 17:37.767
I'VE BLOWN MY NOSE
FOR THE LAST TIME IN THIS HOUSE!

17:37.767 --> 17:39.800
- OH...OH, BOY,

17:39.800 --> 17:41.633
THERE GOES OUR SATURDAY NIGHT!

17:44.933 --> 17:47.233
- TRY THIS TISSUE.

17:47.233 --> 17:49.533
- RAY, I DON'T WANT
TO ARGUE ABOUT THIS.

17:49.533 --> 17:51.500
- GOOD, THEN YOU AGREE
WITH KEEPING THE TISSUES.

17:51.500 --> 17:53.067
- FINE, WE'LL KEEP
THE DAMN TISSUES.

17:53.067 --> 17:54.300
- DON'T CALL 'EM
DAMN TISSUES.

17:54.300 --> 17:56.267
THEY'RE GONNA BE OUR TISSUES,

17:56.267 --> 17:58.033
AND WE'RE GONNA
DISPLAY THEM PROUDLY.

17:58.033 --> 18:00.900
THEY'RE GONNA BE THE OFFICIAL
TISSUES OF THE HOUSE!

18:00.900 --> 18:02.767
- OKAY. THAT'S GREAT.
WHATEVER YOU SAY, HONEY.

18:02.767 --> 18:07.000
I GOT TO GO PICK UP
THE KIDS IN A FEW MINUTES.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.433
AND WE'RE SUPPOSED TO EAT
DINNER AT YOUR PARENTS' TONIGHT,

18:09.433 --> 18:13.233
IF THEY'LL HAVE US OVER
AFTER YOUR LITTLE FREAK-OUT.

18:13.233 --> 18:16.233
- NO, NO, I'M NOT EATING
WITH THOSE DOWNERS!

18:16.233 --> 18:17.967
I'LL MAKE MY OWN FOOD
RIGHT HERE.

18:17.967 --> 18:21.033
AND I'LL DECIDE TO EAT
WHATEVER THE HELL I WANT.

18:21.033 --> 18:23.333
ALL RIGHT?
JUST SO YOU KNOW!

18:25.867 --> 18:27.367
I HAPPEN TO BE A VERY GOOD COOK.

18:37.800 --> 18:39.467
[phone rings]

18:41.700 --> 18:42.733
- HELLO?

18:42.733 --> 18:44.167
HEY, GIANNI.
YEAH.

18:44.167 --> 18:45.433
NO, NOTHING.

18:45.433 --> 18:47.633
DEBRA'S GOING NUTTY
ON ME OVER HERE,

18:47.633 --> 18:49.667
BUT WHAT ELSE IS NEW?

18:49.667 --> 18:53.067
YEAH, I CAN GOLF TOMORROW.
YES.

18:53.067 --> 18:55.333
IT'S NOT GONNA SNOW.
IT'S GONNA BE 40 DEGREES.

18:55.333 --> 18:58.767
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
SNOW...

18:58.767 --> 19:00.567
NO. IT'S GONNA BE FINE.

19:00.567 --> 19:03.333
RED SKY AT NIGHT,
SAILOR'S DELIGHT.

19:05.833 --> 19:09.367
"SHAKING WITH FRIGHT?"
WHO TOLD YOU THAT?

19:09.367 --> 19:12.600
WELL, YOUR MOTHER'S STUPID, MAN.

19:12.600 --> 19:13.967
YEAH.

19:13.967 --> 19:17.500
HEY, YOU EVER TRY THOSE TISSUES
WITH THE LOTION IN 'EM?

19:17.500 --> 19:20.200
YEAH.
NO, THEY'RE GOOD.

19:20.200 --> 19:21.367
YES, THEY ARE!

19:23.600 --> 19:24.767
NO, YOU SUCK!

19:26.267 --> 19:27.633
ALL RIGHT.
WHATEVER.

19:27.633 --> 19:29.600
I'LL SEE YA TOMORROW.
YOU BE THERE.

19:29.600 --> 19:31.367
ALL RIGHT. BYE.

19:35.700 --> 19:37.300
MY TISSUES!

20:10.767 --> 20:11.767
- RAY, WHAT THE--

20:11.767 --> 20:12.767
- FIRE!

20:12.767 --> 20:15.500
THERE'S A FIRE!

20:15.500 --> 20:17.133
- OH, GOD!

20:17.133 --> 20:18.267
- GET OUT OF THE WAY!

20:18.267 --> 20:20.033
- [screaming]

21:12.000 --> 21:13.600
- WELL, IT TOOK CARE
OF THE ANTS!

21:21.400 --> 21:23.800
- MOST OF THIS IS COSMETIC,

21:23.800 --> 21:25.900
SO IT WON'T TAKE TOO LONG
TO GET YOU BACK IN SHAPE.

21:25.900 --> 21:27.400
- OH, GOOD.
- THAT'S GREAT.

21:27.400 --> 21:29.733
- I'VE GOT SOME WALLPAPER
CHOICES OUT IN MY TRUCK.

21:29.733 --> 21:31.833
AND HERE'S
SOME POSSIBILITIES FOR DRAPES.

21:31.833 --> 21:33.400
- GREAT, THANKS.
