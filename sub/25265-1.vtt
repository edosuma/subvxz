06:04.664 --> 06:05.798
Where's Arthur?

06:15.775 --> 06:17.176
Fine, what do you want?

06:27.019 --> 06:28.287
I completely forgot.

06:31.324 --> 06:32.592
Thanks for reminding me.

07:18.604 --> 07:19.672
What is it?

07:27.480 --> 07:29.282
I'm in the middle of something.
What's the problem?

07:38.057 --> 07:40.126
Is it serious or can it wait
till I am finished here.

07:48.468 --> 07:49.535
Fail?

08:36.549 --> 08:37.683
Fuck!

08:38.183 --> 08:39.251
Fuck!

09:12.184 --> 09:13.452
No, don't do that.

09:18.357 --> 09:19.559
I said no!

10:11.811 --> 10:13.079
You.

10:23.589 --> 10:24.757
A bat.

10:34.533 --> 10:38.070
You ask me why I'm wasting my
time on these stupid questions.

10:45.244 --> 10:47.613
Why, I spent months doing this shit.
What's the point?

11:29.321 --> 11:31.457
Things up top are worse
than ever, Roy.

11:32.591 --> 11:35.627
Negotiations have failed.

11:35.628 --> 11:40.231
The clock now stands
at one minute to midnight.

11:40.232 --> 11:44.203
I'm ordering you to move
Plethura into its final stage.

11:45.337 --> 11:46.439
Licorice.

11:47.506 --> 11:48.574
Yes.

11:49.675 --> 11:52.444
The time is now.

11:52.445 --> 11:55.681
You got 24 hours to adapt
the bunker accordingly.

11:56.415 --> 11:57.782
At that point,

11:57.783 --> 12:00.452
Priority 1 will be with you
in less than two hours.

12:00.453 --> 12:01.820
The moment they arrive,

12:01.821 --> 12:03.555
you are to enter the elevator,

12:03.556 --> 12:05.224
and ride it back to the surface.

12:06.325 --> 12:07.592
Understand?

12:07.593 --> 12:09.161
Yeah, I know the protocol.

12:10.429 --> 12:11.563
Good.

12:11.564 --> 12:14.399
Because there won't be
a moment to waste.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.401
Why leave it so late?

12:16.402 --> 12:19.170
We've got one chance
of getting this right.

12:19.171 --> 12:21.574
There is no room
for premature mistakes.

12:22.441 --> 12:23.709
There won't be any.

12:28.347 --> 12:30.182
Plethura will be ready in time.

12:34.653 --> 12:36.287
What's happened to your hand?

12:36.288 --> 12:37.323
Nah.

12:38.357 --> 12:39.792
Nothing, just a mishap.

12:41.093 --> 12:43.194
Why wasn't this reported up top?

12:43.195 --> 12:44.262
It's no big deal,

12:44.263 --> 12:45.231
I didn't think it was important.

12:45.232 --> 12:47.232
Every thing is important, Roy!

12:47.233 --> 12:49.801
This is a deliberate
breach of protocol,

12:49.802 --> 12:51.670
and not for
the first time either.

12:53.339 --> 12:55.707
Do you have a problem
with authority, Roy?

12:55.708 --> 12:57.075
Is that it?

12:57.076 --> 12:59.544
I just want to be trusted
to do my job.

12:59.545 --> 13:02.147
I've got everything
under control down here.

13:02.148 --> 13:04.315
Let's get one thing
straight, Roy.

13:04.316 --> 13:08.319
You are not in control
of this situation.

13:08.320 --> 13:11.357
As a man, you are expendable.

13:12.625 --> 13:15.461
It's what you do which serves
a higher purpose.

13:17.062 --> 13:18.430
You know that.

13:21.167 --> 13:22.334
Yeah, I do.

13:24.637 --> 13:26.639
No, I know
the responsibilities, okay?

13:27.573 --> 13:29.707
Good.

13:29.708 --> 13:33.078
Because this isn't
just about PlethurRoy.

13:34.313 --> 13:37.182
Future generations
will live or die

13:37.183 --> 13:39.351
by the decisions
that we make today.

13:41.687 --> 13:43.556
This is much bigger
than you or I.

13:47.126 --> 13:48.327
It won't happen again.

13:54.767 --> 13:56.335
Have you got anybody on top?

13:59.505 --> 14:00.573
No.

14:03.275 --> 14:05.044
How very lucky you are.

14:35.741 --> 14:38.476
Isn't that respect
too much to ask?

14:38.477 --> 14:39.577
I am a scientist,
for Christ's sake!

14:39.578 --> 14:41.546
And you really expect me
to go running off to mummy

14:41.547 --> 14:42.815
just 'cause I cut my hand!

14:51.123 --> 14:52.591
I'm not a fucking child.

15:04.036 --> 15:05.404
Fuck Priority One!

15:06.605 --> 15:09.173
If it weren't for me,
then we'd all be dead.

15:09.174 --> 15:12.144
No Plethura,
no safe haven, nothing.

15:24.556 --> 15:26.458
What I'm doing is selfless.

15:31.230 --> 15:34.500
I mean, I'm just a pencil
mark in the pages of history.

15:51.450 --> 15:52.818
Someone's always watching.

16:09.068 --> 16:11.403
I just wanted to know I made
a difference, that's all.

17:02.654 --> 17:04.690
Look, Arthur, I'm sorry
if I was a bit...

17:05.257 --> 17:06.257
Ratty earlier.

17:06.258 --> 17:09.060
I'm just... A little
out of sorts lately.

17:37.189 --> 17:40.324
Well, to tell the truth,
I'm feeling a bit nervous

17:40.325 --> 17:41.727
about heading back up top.

17:47.566 --> 17:48.634
Well,

17:50.202 --> 17:52.071
I know I was never meant
to survive down here.

17:53.639 --> 17:55.073
I had a job to do.

17:55.074 --> 17:56.407
A duty.

17:56.408 --> 17:57.709
I did the best I could.

18:00.479 --> 18:03.614
I guess I'm just finding it
harder to leave this place

18:03.615 --> 18:04.650
than I thought I would.

18:12.291 --> 18:13.358
Yeah.

18:16.261 --> 18:18.030
Right outside,
I'd be afraid of surviving.

18:25.737 --> 18:29.240
Well, that's the duality
of man, Arthur.

18:29.241 --> 18:31.809
See, it doesn't matter
what happens up top.

18:31.810 --> 18:34.279
And it won't matter what
happens down below either.

18:43.555 --> 18:45.023
We're never
gonna change, Arthur.

18:47.359 --> 18:48.427
That's the reality.

19:09.081 --> 19:12.751
As a child, I was raised
in a Catholic orphanage.

19:14.052 --> 19:16.354
Once when I was
around nine or ten,

19:16.355 --> 19:19.091
one of the priests caught me
pulling the wings of a fly.

19:19.625 --> 19:21.259
Not in a sadistic way.

19:21.260 --> 19:22.326
I was just a kid.

19:22.327 --> 19:23.495
And innocent.

19:25.330 --> 19:28.767
But the priest took it upon
himself to discipline me.

19:29.501 --> 19:30.602
Privately.

19:32.471 --> 19:33.772
Away from judging eyes.

19:36.308 --> 19:39.343
He told me we mustn't harm
any of God's creatures,

19:39.344 --> 19:41.813
no matter how small or
insignificant they may seem.

19:45.284 --> 19:47.218
And he tried
to exercise his point

19:47.219 --> 19:49.688
by whipping me with a cane
as thick as a man's thumb.

19:50.589 --> 19:52.491
Enough times to draw blood.

19:55.027 --> 19:56.595
A lesson, he told me.

19:58.730 --> 20:01.066
So I feel the same pain
as the fly.

20:06.605 --> 20:08.173
And that's when I realized,

20:11.276 --> 20:13.278
it wasn't God that made
the world this way.

20:17.416 --> 20:18.550
The darkness,

20:19.384 --> 20:20.752
it lives in each of our souls.

20:26.692 --> 20:28.460
That's why we deserve
what we get.

20:43.275 --> 20:44.376
I don't know.

20:47.446 --> 20:51.849
I always found it difficult
to connect with people up top,

20:51.850 --> 20:53.151
so I just,

20:54.119 --> 20:55.454
gave up and...

21:01.560 --> 21:03.328
Ah, you know, talk.

21:03.562 --> 21:04.630
Relate.

21:06.098 --> 21:07.165
Care.

21:14.606 --> 21:17.742
No, I am talking to wires
and programming,

21:17.743 --> 21:20.379
designed to make me think
that I am talking to a person,

21:20.712 --> 21:21.813
but I am not.

21:38.297 --> 21:40.565
Well, I guess, pride goes
before destruction.

21:48.674 --> 21:50.042
It's a proverb.

21:51.443 --> 21:53.812
I supposed we did it to
ourselves because we could.

22:00.552 --> 22:03.220
And we deny it.

22:03.221 --> 22:06.091
Choose not to acknowledge the
knife-edge we are living on.

22:13.332 --> 22:14.499
In a way, yeah.

22:22.474 --> 22:24.042
To spare ourselves pain?

22:24.643 --> 22:26.378
Make life seem worth living?

22:38.724 --> 22:39.791
I don't know anymore.

23:41.253 --> 23:43.654
No, no, no. This can't be happening.
This can't...

23:43.655 --> 23:45.657
Well, are there any
communications from up top?

23:49.194 --> 23:50.429
What about Priority One?

24:02.441 --> 24:03.608
I didn't make it.

25:25.357 --> 25:28.826
I want all the data
collected from the surface.

25:28.827 --> 25:30.729
We need to work out
the blast radius.

25:41.172 --> 25:43.108
What are you talking about?
The clock's running.

25:57.088 --> 25:58.456
What the hell
happened out there?

26:17.475 --> 26:18.543
What is it?

26:26.551 --> 26:27.719
Of course, I am.

26:37.395 --> 26:38.563
I shouldn't be alive.

26:41.433 --> 26:42.801
A lot of people died, Arthur.

26:45.170 --> 26:47.505
I'm now a relic
of an endangered species.

26:49.474 --> 26:50.609
Wouldn't you be sad?

27:06.658 --> 27:08.293
This conversation's over.

30:04.502 --> 30:06.571
Stop asking me that.
How do you think I'm feeling?

30:19.350 --> 30:20.418
All right.

30:21.686 --> 30:22.754
Of course, you can.

30:49.047 --> 30:50.114
What is it?

30:58.289 --> 30:59.357
Yeah.

31:00.458 --> 31:01.593
That's what you are.

31:11.536 --> 31:12.604
Yeah, but...

31:19.377 --> 31:20.511
What are you talking about?

31:53.077 --> 31:54.279
I'm not sure.

32:05.290 --> 32:07.191
Perhaps, but it's rare
for me to remember.

32:17.669 --> 32:19.671
It's most likely
just the surveillance feeds.

32:28.579 --> 32:31.214
Every 24 hours,
the protocol states that

32:31.215 --> 32:33.418
the surveillance feed must be
backed up to the hard drive.

32:39.757 --> 32:41.591
They're not dream, Arthur.

32:41.592 --> 32:44.127
They're duplicates.

32:44.128 --> 32:46.431
You're seeing the past and present
simultaneously. That's all.

33:50.595 --> 33:52.330
I'm kind of busy right now.

34:45.049 --> 34:46.150
Where's it coming from?

34:54.324 --> 34:55.393
Play it.

35:07.438 --> 35:08.673
It's Morse code.

35:15.413 --> 35:16.547
SOS.

35:27.091 --> 35:28.192
Yes.

36:09.066 --> 36:10.201
What is that?

36:25.316 --> 36:27.118
Isolate the audio.
Just the voice.

36:52.076 --> 36:53.344
What language is that?

37:01.619 --> 37:03.087
Translate what she's saying.

39:17.588 --> 39:19.023
There is no radiation.

40:16.781 --> 40:18.048
There's a leak.

40:24.522 --> 40:25.989
Right now, it's just oxygen.

40:25.990 --> 40:28.659
But if there is a way in, Plethura
could become compromised.

42:45.729 --> 42:47.031
What the hell is this?

42:51.402 --> 42:52.670
What the hell is this?

43:12.089 --> 43:13.157
Why?

44:29.667 --> 44:31.168
What is this place?

44:40.210 --> 44:41.512
What's it for, Arthur?

44:43.681 --> 44:45.449
Why would someone
try to get in here?

44:47.184 --> 44:48.786
How could they? No one else
made it down below.

44:56.727 --> 44:59.263
Or maybe it's purpose
is to fuck with my mind.

45:07.037 --> 45:09.138
Am I?

45:09.139 --> 45:11.108
Is it irrational to do what
they are doing to me?

45:17.514 --> 45:18.682
Management.

45:24.021 --> 45:26.090
After all, there is always
someone watching.

45:27.491 --> 45:28.592
Isn't that right, Arthur?

45:35.165 --> 45:37.700
I know what this place is.

45:37.701 --> 45:39.336
In fact, I think I've known
for a while.

45:47.244 --> 45:48.445
Oh, you know what
I'm talking about.

45:52.783 --> 45:55.252
Don't think of me as an idiot.
I've figured it out.

46:01.058 --> 46:02.326
But none of this is real!

46:08.165 --> 46:09.732
What am I, a test subject?

46:09.733 --> 46:12.402
For Priority One!
A psychological profile, huh?

46:18.509 --> 46:19.810
We talk about it.
Of course, it does.

46:20.644 --> 46:21.978
You shot someone off.

46:21.979 --> 46:24.614
You condition them and then you
just wait for them to crack

46:24.615 --> 46:26.749
and count the days for them
to go mad, is it?

46:26.750 --> 46:27.785
Is that it?

46:52.242 --> 46:53.577
It's not our situation.

46:55.045 --> 46:56.180
It's mine.

47:43.594 --> 47:44.695
Roy?

47:49.433 --> 47:51.068
Roy!

47:55.572 --> 47:57.040
Roy?

48:50.027 --> 48:51.595
How the hell did
my chamber door get open?

48:56.533 --> 48:58.234
The door to my chamber,

48:58.235 --> 48:59.703
how the fuck did it get open?

49:06.109 --> 49:08.010
Every night, I lock that door.

49:08.011 --> 49:11.314
I can't sleep unless I know that it's locked,
I've been that way since I was a child.

49:11.315 --> 49:14.116
But today, I wake up
and it's open.

49:14.117 --> 49:15.152
How?

49:21.058 --> 49:22.526
Who opened that fucking door?

49:31.101 --> 49:32.302
What are you trying to do to me?

49:34.271 --> 49:35.539
You think that I know who I am.

49:38.141 --> 49:39.776
Show me the surveillance feeds
for the hub.

49:45.615 --> 49:47.050
Just do it.

50:05.235 --> 50:06.503
What are you talking about?

50:15.045 --> 50:16.413
I thought we fixed that.

50:24.621 --> 50:26.655
Tell me how is it that
there is a power shortage

50:26.656 --> 50:28.125
that you know nothing about!

50:32.329 --> 50:33.630
How do you explain that?

50:40.637 --> 50:41.738
Or else what?

51:06.663 --> 51:07.764
Let it fail.

51:15.672 --> 51:17.140
You heard it, Arthur.

51:18.575 --> 51:19.810
I said let it fail.

51:26.650 --> 51:27.818
No, it won't.

51:30.220 --> 51:32.022
This is a simulated environment.

51:32.689 --> 51:33.790
I know it.

51:34.658 --> 51:36.059
Even if you don't.

51:43.733 --> 51:45.102
Instinct.

51:47.104 --> 51:48.772
Or something
you know about, is it?

51:58.615 --> 52:00.183
Why, because I know the truth?

52:06.456 --> 52:07.823
What I believe, Arthur,

52:07.824 --> 52:09.626
is that I will discover the truth
by going through that door.

52:28.211 --> 52:29.312
You think I'm afraid.

52:59.209 --> 53:00.577
Where do I find it?

53:51.428 --> 53:53.596
See if you can figure out
what the problem is.

53:53.597 --> 53:55.432
I'm going to focus
on restoring power.

56:25.648 --> 56:27.150
No!

56:45.668 --> 56:48.404
Arthur, pull those surveillance
feeds up on the screen,

56:48.405 --> 56:50.507
that track all the motion
sensors around the bunker.

56:54.444 --> 56:55.712
Just do it!

58:05.081 --> 58:06.216
I'm a scientist.

58:07.750 --> 58:09.185
I believe in facts.

58:09.819 --> 58:11.754
Not fabrications.

58:15.024 --> 58:16.726
Only an inalienable truth.

58:20.330 --> 58:21.564
But you are right, Arthur.

58:23.700 --> 58:25.168
I'm afraid.

58:40.183 --> 58:42.318
I'm afraid that
I'm losing my mind.

58:45.088 --> 58:46.789
And I don't think
I'm alone down here.

58:51.194 --> 58:52.595
Arthur, is it real?

58:59.335 --> 59:00.503
Plethura.

59:10.480 --> 59:11.548
Of course.

59:35.705 --> 59:37.106
What do you mean?

01:09:31.433 --> 01:09:33.602
I convinced myself
I was losing my mind, Arthur.

01:09:36.372 --> 01:09:38.741
See if I'm more comforted,
I need to know the truth.

01:09:46.348 --> 01:09:47.983
No, I'm not alone
in this bunker.

01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:52.421
This...

01:09:53.421 --> 01:09:54.757
Manifestation.

01:09:55.791 --> 01:09:57.725
This material.

01:09:57.726 --> 01:10:00.262
Able to make physical contact
with objects.

01:10:00.663 --> 01:10:02.064
Whatever it is.

01:10:07.102 --> 01:10:08.470
It lives.

01:10:16.645 --> 01:10:17.780
I've seen it, Arthur.

01:10:21.650 --> 01:10:24.520
Almost human, and yet,
somehow not.

01:10:26.422 --> 01:10:27.656
It's deformed.

01:10:28.424 --> 01:10:29.558
And in pain.

01:10:31.193 --> 01:10:32.661
I've seen these effects before.

01:10:34.096 --> 01:10:35.197
It's radiation poisoning.

01:10:43.072 --> 01:10:46.208
Don't tell me what is or isn't
possible, I've seen it!

01:10:48.143 --> 01:10:51.180
That thing going in here, it
broke the black ring with it.

01:11:00.289 --> 01:11:01.390
Really?

01:11:02.591 --> 01:11:03.726
And how do you explain this?

01:11:59.782 --> 01:12:01.517
What the fuck
is happening to me?

01:12:09.325 --> 01:12:10.192
It's you.

01:12:12.594 --> 01:12:14.163
You're trying
to drive me insane.

01:12:20.636 --> 01:12:22.270
No, it's you!

01:12:22.271 --> 01:12:23.604
It's you!

01:14:40.409 --> 01:14:41.543
Arthur!

01:14:43.178 --> 01:14:44.513
Arthur, what's happening.

01:16:21.610 --> 01:16:23.712
Come on!

01:19:35.604 --> 01:19:37.139
Come on!

01:20:39.367 --> 01:20:40.602
Arthur, you there?

01:20:41.503 --> 01:20:42.804
Arthur, can you hear me?

01:20:46.374 --> 01:20:48.709
Please! I need to...

01:20:48.710 --> 01:20:51.246
Understand. What is it?

01:20:54.416 --> 01:20:55.717
What is it?

01:21:01.556 --> 01:21:02.757
Arthur!

01:25:11.573 --> 01:25:12.773
Fuck you!

01:26:17.205 --> 01:26:19.541
No! No! No!

01:26:21.809 --> 01:26:23.311
No!

01:26:26.581 --> 01:26:28.282
No!
