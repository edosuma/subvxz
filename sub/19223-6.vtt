WEBVTT

00:02.336 --> 00:03.804
- And we go now live
to Crimson Fox

00:03.836 --> 00:05.306
for an announcement.

00:05.339 --> 00:08.576
- [sighs]
Man, this is tough.

00:08.609 --> 00:10.778
Starting today,
I'll be leaving Charm City

00:10.811 --> 00:12.680
and taking my talents
to Metropolis.

00:12.713 --> 00:15.116
[crowd groans]
Adjacent.

00:15.149 --> 00:18.586
- I can't believe
she's just leaving us.

00:18.619 --> 00:20.588
I mean, she is our main hero.

00:20.621 --> 00:22.590
What if somebody
like the Joker attacks?

00:22.623 --> 00:24.392
- The Joker is an A-list
super villain.

00:24.425 --> 00:26.527
He wouldn't attack
a dump like Charm City.

00:26.560 --> 00:30.398
We begged
for a WNBA team, Emily.

00:30.431 --> 00:31.799
They said no.

00:31.832 --> 00:34.402
A WNBA team.

00:34.435 --> 00:35.703
- Now that Crimson Fox
is leaving,

00:35.736 --> 00:37.605
maybe we'll get a cool
new superhero.

00:37.638 --> 00:39.740
What if we got Aqualad?
- Aqualad?

00:39.773 --> 00:41.675
No, Aqualad's a sidekick,
not a hero.

00:41.709 --> 00:43.811
That's like hoping our city gets
protection from a cheese plate.

00:43.844 --> 00:45.613
[both laugh]
- He's right.

00:45.646 --> 00:47.515
- It's cool that you guys
can laugh about this,

00:47.548 --> 00:50.684
but with Crimson Fox gone,
petty crime will skyrocket,

00:50.718 --> 00:53.621
and let's be real:
women are always the target.

00:53.654 --> 00:55.089
- Emily is right.

00:55.123 --> 00:57.425
The creeps are already
feeling emboldened.

00:57.458 --> 01:00.628
Weird Tony the hot dog guy
was extra weird this morning.

01:00.661 --> 01:04.165
- Wait a minute, you mean
Fun Tony the hot dog guy.

01:04.197 --> 01:05.766
- Yeah, what's wrong
with Fun Tony the hot dog guy?

01:05.799 --> 01:07.535
- Yeah?

01:07.568 --> 01:11.739
all: "Hey, sexy lady,
come sit on Tony's lap

01:11.772 --> 01:15.109
and touch Tony's hot dog."

01:15.143 --> 01:16.844
- Oh, he's definitely
talking about his penis.

01:16.877 --> 01:18.546
- Yeah, that's his penis.

01:18.579 --> 01:20.181
All right, look,
if you're worried about crime,

01:20.214 --> 01:21.782
I can walk you guys
to your car at night.

01:21.815 --> 01:25.486
I mean, I don't
look intimidating, but...

01:27.688 --> 01:29.390
- But what?

01:29.423 --> 01:30.858
- I was hoping
someone would disagree.

01:30.891 --> 01:32.460
- Who cares?

01:32.493 --> 01:33.594
It's going to be fine.

01:33.627 --> 01:36.197
You ladies need to grow a pair.

01:36.230 --> 01:37.731
All of you.

01:37.765 --> 01:39.833
[insect buzzing]

01:39.867 --> 01:41.602
Jackie, there's a bee
in my office!

01:41.635 --> 01:42.836
Aah, aah!

01:42.870 --> 01:45.606
Jackie!
It looks stingy!

01:45.639 --> 01:47.675
- Our fearless leader.

01:47.708 --> 01:50.678
[heroic music]

01:50.711 --> 01:57.651
*

02:20.274 --> 02:21.909
- Hey, you know,
I was thinking about taking

02:21.942 --> 02:24.645
a self-defense class
now that Crimson Fox is gone.

02:24.678 --> 02:26.180
Want to do it with me?

02:26.214 --> 02:27.615
- Look, I don't have time
for some class.

02:27.648 --> 02:28.916
I'm either taking care
of a child--

02:28.949 --> 02:30.251
- Jackie!

02:30.284 --> 02:31.519
- Or I'm at home
with my kid.

02:31.552 --> 02:32.820
- I thought
you might say that,

02:32.853 --> 02:34.922
so I already found us a class
during lunch.

02:34.955 --> 02:36.724
I'll take care
of everything.

02:36.757 --> 02:39.560
All you need to do
is show up.

02:39.593 --> 02:41.729
There's a chance you'll get
to punch a stranger.

02:41.762 --> 02:42.930
- Jackie, hurry!

02:42.963 --> 02:44.832
- All right, I'm in.

02:44.865 --> 02:45.833
[upbeat music]

02:45.866 --> 02:46.834
- Yah, yah!

02:46.867 --> 02:48.536
- Jackie!

02:48.569 --> 02:50.538
*

02:50.571 --> 02:52.773
- The bee did not
lay eggs in your hair.

02:52.806 --> 02:54.575
I Googled it.
It's impossible.

02:54.608 --> 02:57.745
- No, something horrible
has happened.

02:57.778 --> 02:58.979
Round up the floor.

02:59.012 --> 03:01.482
*

03:01.515 --> 03:02.883
A violation has occurred.

03:02.916 --> 03:04.752
At approximately 10:02
this morning,

03:04.785 --> 03:06.554
I walked
into my personal bathroom

03:06.587 --> 03:08.556
to discover evidence

03:08.589 --> 03:11.592
that it had been used
by another.

03:13.961 --> 03:15.863
Why is no one gasping?
Gasp.

03:15.896 --> 03:18.599
[all gasp]

03:18.632 --> 03:20.568
Thank you,
I feel the same way.

03:20.601 --> 03:23.003
Before today, the only cheeks
that had graced that throne

03:23.036 --> 03:24.805
belonged to me

03:24.838 --> 03:28.676
and, of course, my beloved
golden retriever, Boomer,

03:28.709 --> 03:31.912
whom I painstakingly taught
to go human-style

03:31.945 --> 03:34.515
before he promptly ran away.

03:34.548 --> 03:37.251
Now, I promise you that justice
will be swift and fair.

03:37.285 --> 03:38.719
You will be fired.

03:40.621 --> 03:42.256
So please step forward

03:42.290 --> 03:44.825
and take your punishment
with dignity.

03:48.362 --> 03:49.297
No one?

03:51.031 --> 03:52.700
No one?

03:52.733 --> 03:53.901
Dorothy...

03:53.934 --> 03:55.035
was it you?

03:55.068 --> 03:56.870
Looking a little depleted,

03:56.904 --> 04:00.741
a little "Turder, She Wrote,"
maybe, hmm?

04:00.774 --> 04:02.943
A little "Law & Order: IBS"?

04:04.978 --> 04:06.747
That is a guilty face.

04:06.780 --> 04:10.751
Okay, okay,
I will flush you out.

04:10.784 --> 04:12.820
And then you'll be fired.

04:12.853 --> 04:17.625
*

04:17.658 --> 04:19.927
- Hey, have you seen Jackie?

04:19.959 --> 04:21.728
- Who's "Bitch I'ma"?

04:21.762 --> 04:24.365
- Oh, it makes more sense
when Jackie wears hers.

04:24.398 --> 04:26.367
"Bitch I'ma End You!"
- [laughs]

04:26.400 --> 04:28.068
- We're taking
self-defense classes.

04:28.101 --> 04:30.638
If she ever gets here.

04:30.671 --> 04:33.841
- "I'ma Bitch"?
Hmm, inappropriate, Emily.

04:33.874 --> 04:35.976
Appreciate the honesty,
but still...

04:36.009 --> 04:37.378
inappropriate.

04:37.411 --> 04:39.079
- [sighs]
- You think Jackie's

04:39.112 --> 04:42.049
gonna take self-defense classes
in matching shirts with you?

04:42.082 --> 04:44.017
- Well, it's sort of,
like, an inside joke.

04:44.051 --> 04:46.019
- I don't think Jackie
does inside jokes.

04:46.053 --> 04:48.856
- Well, that's because
you're not on the inside.

04:48.889 --> 04:51.925
Me and Jackie,
we've got our own thing.

04:51.959 --> 04:53.394
- And yet she's not here.

04:53.427 --> 04:55.996
- Well, she probably
just decided to meet me there.

04:56.029 --> 04:59.867
So I'm gonna go learn
to kick ass with Jackie.

04:59.900 --> 05:02.870
[light music]

05:02.903 --> 05:04.304
[sighs]

05:06.106 --> 05:07.975
- Emily?

05:08.008 --> 05:08.976
- Hi.

05:09.009 --> 05:10.878
- Whoa, that class
is no joke.

05:10.911 --> 05:12.413
- Yeah, well,
Jackie didn't show,

05:12.446 --> 05:13.981
and on my way back,
I ran into an alleyway

05:14.014 --> 05:16.083
to avoid one
of Jack-O-Lantern's fireballs

05:16.116 --> 05:17.918
and tripped
and fell into the trash.

05:17.951 --> 05:21.789
- Oh, sexy lady
covered in garbage.

05:21.822 --> 05:23.691
Still sexy.
[chuckles]

05:23.724 --> 05:25.125
- Not now, Tony.

05:25.158 --> 05:27.595
- Yeah, that is
disrespectful, Tony!

05:28.929 --> 05:31.432
Mm?
- I can't believe it.

05:31.465 --> 05:33.834
Jackie knew how much I was
looking forward to this class,

05:33.867 --> 05:35.369
and she just stands me up?

05:35.403 --> 05:37.070
- Well, maybe
she had an emergency,

05:37.104 --> 05:40.708
or maybe she's sitting in a car
over there reading a book.

05:40.741 --> 05:42.643
- What?

05:42.676 --> 05:44.011
*

05:44.044 --> 05:45.946
[exhales deeply]

05:47.014 --> 05:47.981
[thud]
- [shrieks]

05:48.015 --> 05:48.982
- Self-defense class!

05:49.016 --> 05:50.718
Where the hell were you?

05:50.751 --> 05:53.020
- I was busy.
I figured you'd just go alone.

05:53.053 --> 05:55.389
[sniffs]
Why do you smell like garbage?

05:55.423 --> 05:57.057
Actually, can we
talk about this later?

05:57.090 --> 05:59.827
- No, we're talking
about this right now.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.729
Friends don't
stand each other up.

06:01.762 --> 06:03.664
They send a text
with enough sad emojis

06:03.697 --> 06:05.866
to make you feel
how sorry they are.

06:05.899 --> 06:06.867
[door slides open]

06:06.900 --> 06:08.001
[shrieks]

06:10.504 --> 06:12.873
- Is this an UberPOOL?
'Cause I didn't select pool.

06:12.906 --> 06:14.408
- It is not a pool.

06:14.442 --> 06:16.043
I was just telling
this little homeless lady

06:16.076 --> 06:17.978
to get out of my car.

06:18.011 --> 06:20.414
I'm trying to make a little
extra cash on the side, okay?

06:20.448 --> 06:22.483
- Why didn't you
just tell me that?

06:22.516 --> 06:23.951
- So are we going or what?

06:23.984 --> 06:26.720
- You heard her.
Get out of my car, sporty hobo.

06:28.188 --> 06:29.857
Tiny water bottle?

06:29.890 --> 06:30.858
[door slams]

06:30.891 --> 06:33.427

06:36.129 --> 06:39.132
[tense music]

06:39.166 --> 06:40.801
*

06:40.834 --> 06:43.036
- Jackie, I'm not sure why you--
Ow!

06:43.070 --> 06:44.137
Ow, ow, ow, ow,

06:44.171 --> 06:45.706
ow, ow, ow, ow,

06:45.739 --> 06:48.509
ow, ow, ow, ow,
ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

06:48.542 --> 06:51.044
- I'm gonna be direct, which is
something you love about me.

06:51.078 --> 06:52.079
- Oh, yeah.

06:52.112 --> 06:53.514
- My daughter Ruby's class

06:53.547 --> 06:55.716
is taking a trip
to Six Flags Metropolis.

06:55.749 --> 06:58.051
It's $500, and money's
a little tight right now.

06:58.085 --> 07:00.821
I really don't need any of these
human bedbugs knowing that,

07:00.854 --> 07:04.792
so as far as you're concerned,
I am not an Uber driver.

07:04.825 --> 07:06.727
- Yeah, but with
Crimson Fox gone,

07:06.760 --> 07:09.730
you could get mugged or get hit
by Jack-O-Lantern's fireball.

07:09.763 --> 07:12.533
It's just not safe for you
to be driving strangers around.

07:12.566 --> 07:13.801
- All right.
- Aah!

07:13.834 --> 07:15.002
- Who drives
strangers around?

07:15.035 --> 07:17.170
- No one,
not one person ever.

07:18.238 --> 07:19.540
Where'd you learn that?

07:19.573 --> 07:21.008
- [sighs]
I have two brothers.

07:21.041 --> 07:22.810
- Oh, you have two brothers?
Older or younger?

07:22.843 --> 07:24.244
- Please stop bonding with me.

07:24.277 --> 07:26.547
- Listen, if you need--
- I don't want to talk about it,

07:26.580 --> 07:29.817
and I really don't want you
to "Emily" this.

07:29.850 --> 07:33.120
- Aww, people are using
my name as a verb?

07:33.153 --> 07:35.923
Aah!
I will not Emily this.

07:35.956 --> 07:38.025
So I don't want
to make this a big thing,

07:38.058 --> 07:39.927
but someone who I'm not
going to mention

07:39.960 --> 07:41.094
needs a little help.

07:41.128 --> 07:44.197
- Oh, are you trying
to Emily something?

07:44.231 --> 07:45.833
- Look, we're not gonna
give money to Jackie

07:45.866 --> 07:46.967
unless we know what it's for.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.769
- Well, she told me not to--
Damn it.

07:48.802 --> 07:50.137
- Oh.
- I knew it was Jackie.

07:50.170 --> 07:52.239
- Now, that was some
David Blaine [bleep].

07:52.272 --> 07:53.941
- Okay, this cannot be repeated.

07:53.974 --> 07:56.043
Her kid needs $500
for a school trip.

07:56.076 --> 07:57.878
I thought we could all pitch in
to help her out.

07:57.911 --> 07:59.146
- Jackie is never
gonna take our money.

07:59.179 --> 08:00.981
She is crazy private.

08:01.014 --> 08:02.983
- I have a pretty genius way
around that.

08:03.016 --> 08:04.585
- Oh, so you're gonna Teddy it.
- What's that?

08:04.618 --> 08:06.119
- Well, that's--
- That's when you try

08:06.153 --> 08:07.988
to turn your name into a verb
unsuccessfully.

08:08.021 --> 08:09.056
[laughter]

08:09.089 --> 08:11.158
- Ooh, you just got Wendy-ed.

08:11.191 --> 08:12.860
[laughter]

08:12.893 --> 08:15.863
- Everyone in my office
except I'ma Bitch.

08:15.896 --> 08:17.130
You can stay here.

08:17.164 --> 08:19.132
- That's not even
what the shirt said.

08:20.200 --> 08:22.002
- The Three Amigos,

08:22.035 --> 08:24.071
the Three Musketeers,

08:24.104 --> 08:26.607
the Dynamic Duo...

08:26.640 --> 08:28.542
and you.

08:28.576 --> 08:30.243
I bet you thought
you were in the clear,

08:30.277 --> 08:32.813
but you're the only three people
who were in the office

08:32.846 --> 08:34.147
when the crime was committed.

08:34.181 --> 08:37.217
I know.
I checked the logs.

08:37.250 --> 08:39.620
- [chortles]
I just want to point out

08:39.653 --> 08:41.254
that we're talking
about a poop crime,

08:41.288 --> 08:43.289
and you said "logs."

08:43.323 --> 08:45.626
[all chuckling]

08:45.659 --> 08:46.560
- That's fair.

08:48.328 --> 08:49.630
Who did this?

08:49.663 --> 08:51.298
- Van, this is silly.
It wasn't us.

08:51.331 --> 08:54.568
- Pedro, could you
come in here, please?

08:56.937 --> 08:58.271
- It's, uh, Peter, sir.

08:58.305 --> 09:00.040
- Pedro, when you entered

09:00.073 --> 09:02.576
into my personal bathroom
yesterday to clean it,

09:02.610 --> 09:04.344
what did you find?

09:04.377 --> 09:06.013
- Oh, there were
these small scissors

09:06.046 --> 09:07.648
and all these clumps
of short, curly hairs

09:07.681 --> 09:08.949
all around the base of the bowl.

09:08.982 --> 09:10.017
- Not that!

09:10.050 --> 09:11.919
I told you, not that.
Wh--

09:11.952 --> 09:12.953
The other thing.

09:15.355 --> 09:16.924
- This magazine, sir.

09:16.957 --> 09:18.225
- Thank you, Pedrito.

09:18.258 --> 09:19.226
- It's Peter.

09:19.259 --> 09:21.194
- Witness excused.

09:21.228 --> 09:22.329
Adios.

09:22.362 --> 09:25.332
Who does this belong to?

09:25.365 --> 09:28.201
Who was perusing
while they were number twos-ing?

09:30.170 --> 09:31.672
Come on, people,
I'm giving you an opportunity

09:31.705 --> 09:33.073
to snitch on a friend.

09:33.106 --> 09:34.975
I used to live for this
in boarding school.

09:36.710 --> 09:38.145
- None of us did it.

09:38.178 --> 09:39.680
- All right.

09:39.713 --> 09:42.382
You're sticking together, okay.

09:42.415 --> 09:43.984
No, well, let's see
how long that lasts

09:44.017 --> 09:46.053
once I move your workspaces...

09:46.086 --> 09:49.356
to Conference Room...B.

09:49.389 --> 09:52.125
- [screams]

09:53.727 --> 09:55.328
Wait, what's Conference Room B?

09:55.362 --> 09:56.897
[door creaks]

09:56.930 --> 09:57.998
[ominous music]

09:58.031 --> 09:59.266
- Oh. [chuckles]

09:59.299 --> 10:01.068
Please, come in.

10:01.101 --> 10:03.303
Take in your surroundings,

10:03.336 --> 10:07.074
because this hellscape
is where you will be living

10:07.107 --> 10:09.376
until someone tells me
who did it.

10:09.409 --> 10:12.179
- Um, okay, so, uh,
what was so bad

10:12.212 --> 10:14.114
about this conference room,
again?

10:14.147 --> 10:18.218
- I think you may have noticed
the terrifying lighting.

10:21.154 --> 10:23.190
[Van laughs maniacally]

10:23.223 --> 10:24.725
Oh, come on.

10:24.758 --> 10:25.726
- Yeah, that's it.
- That's it.

10:25.759 --> 10:27.394
- Well, let me tell you this.

10:27.427 --> 10:30.097
These chairs...
are the old ones,

10:30.130 --> 10:31.231
before the upgrade.

10:31.264 --> 10:33.734
They're unable to spin.

10:33.767 --> 10:35.736
- Actually, you need
to just reach back here,

10:35.769 --> 10:38.138
hit this little doohickey,
and...

10:38.171 --> 10:39.740
you could go wherever you want.

10:39.773 --> 10:40.741
- I got it.
- Hee!

10:40.774 --> 10:43.343
- Yeah, whee!

10:43.376 --> 10:45.112
- Whee!
- Whee!

10:45.145 --> 10:46.313
[phone clatters]

10:48.782 --> 10:51.018
- All right,
"whee" all you want,

10:51.051 --> 10:54.154
but let me put
this little notion in your ear.

10:54.187 --> 10:56.023
No one crosses
Vanderveer Wayne

10:56.056 --> 10:59.226
and gets out clean
on the other side.

10:59.259 --> 11:01.328
It's about to get nasty.

11:01.361 --> 11:04.031
*

11:04.064 --> 11:05.332
[door slams]

11:06.800 --> 11:08.368
all: Whee!

11:08.401 --> 11:09.703
[laughter]

11:12.272 --> 11:13.774
[bell rings]

11:13.807 --> 11:15.175
- Hi there, are you Mrs. Fry?

11:15.208 --> 11:17.144
- Yes, are--
are you a parent?

11:17.177 --> 11:19.179
- [laughs]
Me, a parent?

11:19.212 --> 11:21.414
That's hilarious.
I'm super young.

11:21.448 --> 11:23.450
Look, uh, one of my good friends
has a daughter

11:23.483 --> 11:25.052
in your class, Ruby?

11:25.085 --> 11:26.720
- Mm-hmm.
- I just wanted to drop off

11:26.754 --> 11:28.255
this check, you know,
on the down-low

11:28.288 --> 11:29.322
for her class trip.

11:29.356 --> 11:31.058
- What class trip?

11:31.091 --> 11:34.061
- Uh, you're all going
to Six Flags Metropolis.

11:34.094 --> 11:37.397
- We're all going
to Six Flags Metropolis!

11:37.430 --> 11:38.732
all: Yay!

11:38.766 --> 11:40.801
- No! No, class, calm down.

11:40.834 --> 11:43.103
We are not going
to Six Flags Metropolis.

11:43.136 --> 11:44.805
[all groan]

11:44.838 --> 11:47.274
Look, I don't know what kind
of sick joke you're playing.

11:47.307 --> 11:48.742
This is a public school.

11:48.776 --> 11:50.510
We don't go
to Six Flags Metropolis.

11:50.543 --> 11:54.014
We go to cemeteries
and read sad poems.

11:54.047 --> 11:55.215
Leave.

11:55.248 --> 11:57.350
- [growls]

12:01.121 --> 12:03.223
- All right,
Operation: Help Jackie is over.

12:03.256 --> 12:05.325
Now we're doing Operation:
Mind Your Own Business

12:05.358 --> 12:06.827
and Just Act Cool.

12:06.860 --> 12:08.428
- Okay, so you want us
to un-Emily this?

12:08.461 --> 12:10.197
- Um, I don't think
acting cool

12:10.230 --> 12:12.499
is the opposite
of Emily-ing something.

12:14.234 --> 12:16.103
all: No.

12:16.136 --> 12:18.105
- Mm-mm.

12:18.138 --> 12:19.840
- So we're good
on dropping this?

12:19.873 --> 12:21.208
I was trying
to be a good friend,

12:21.241 --> 12:22.309
and I just went too far.

12:22.342 --> 12:23.844
Jackie is my friend,

12:23.877 --> 12:26.213
and if she needs my help,
she'll come to me.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.849
The important thing
is that no one mentions

12:28.882 --> 12:31.118
that I went
to her daughter's school.

12:31.151 --> 12:33.386
- That's the lady!

12:33.420 --> 12:37.124
She's the one who said
we were going to Six Flags.

12:37.157 --> 12:39.426
- Oh, my God, Jackie!
[chuckles nervously]

12:39.459 --> 12:41.161
Is this your daughter

12:41.194 --> 12:43.330
who I am definitely meeting
for the first time?

12:43.363 --> 12:46.333
[dramatic music]

12:46.366 --> 12:48.035
*

12:49.436 --> 12:53.240
[lamp creaking]

12:53.273 --> 12:55.242
- Um, Van, this is ridiculous.

12:55.275 --> 12:58.145
- Teddy, you're a dignified guy.

12:58.178 --> 13:00.814
You wouldn't crap up
another man's toilet.

13:00.848 --> 13:03.083
But Ron?

13:03.116 --> 13:07.287
How much do we
really know about...Ron?

13:07.320 --> 13:09.189
- Lives with his grandma,
favorite food is pickles,

13:09.222 --> 13:11.158
birthday wish is always
for "Jurassic Park" to be real.

13:11.191 --> 13:13.060
- Enough!
No one has to know.

13:15.328 --> 13:17.364
Tell me it was Ron.

13:17.397 --> 13:20.367
*

13:20.400 --> 13:21.902
Pick it--pick it up!

13:21.935 --> 13:24.404
That's the--I--
That's why I slid it.

13:24.437 --> 13:27.307
*

13:27.340 --> 13:29.176
- $1,000 to
Furniture Within Grasp?

13:29.209 --> 13:30.543
- Mm.

13:30.577 --> 13:32.379
- This could buy a whole
folding chair or an ottoman.

13:32.412 --> 13:33.847
- And all of that
can be yours

13:33.881 --> 13:35.916
if you just
set the truth free.

13:35.949 --> 13:37.584
The truth is a little bird.

13:37.617 --> 13:39.486
It's cooped up in a cage.

13:39.519 --> 13:42.122
It's either open that door,
set it free,

13:42.155 --> 13:45.592
let it fly out
on the wings of...

13:45.625 --> 13:47.194
feathers--
I don't--

13:47.227 --> 13:48.528
It's a bird, so it--
I don't know.

13:48.561 --> 13:51.298
Just--look,
it's 1,000 bucks.

13:51.331 --> 13:53.300
Grasp the furniture.

13:53.333 --> 13:56.236
*

13:56.269 --> 13:57.938
Teddy ratted you out.

13:57.971 --> 13:59.639
- What?
He did?

13:59.672 --> 14:03.210
- Yup, he sold you out faster
than a Mumford & Sons concert

14:03.243 --> 14:04.945
in the whitest part
of Portland.

14:04.978 --> 14:06.479
- You could just say
"Portland."

14:06.513 --> 14:08.315
- He says it's you.

14:08.348 --> 14:11.384
Unless, of course, he's lying
to cover his own ass.

14:12.986 --> 14:15.422
Or maybe it's no one's
friend, Wendy.

14:15.455 --> 14:18.525
*

14:18.558 --> 14:22.429
Wendy.
Wendy, Wendy, Wendy.

14:22.462 --> 14:25.332
Tell me, Wendy,

14:25.365 --> 14:29.402
why does Wendy
always pretend-y?

14:31.671 --> 14:34.975
- Are we flirting?
- What?

14:35.008 --> 14:36.977
- Finally.
- No.

14:37.010 --> 14:39.179
- Hello.

14:39.212 --> 14:40.547
Hmm?

14:40.580 --> 14:42.249
- Keep it on.
Keep it on. Keep it on.

14:42.282 --> 14:45.285
*

14:45.318 --> 14:46.453
- Missed you at coffee.

14:46.486 --> 14:49.256
I got you one anyways.

14:49.289 --> 14:53.360
Okay, obviously,
you're still needing space.

14:53.393 --> 14:55.462
You know, I just want to say
I've forgiven you

14:55.495 --> 14:58.565
for lying to me about needing
the money for Six Flags...

14:58.598 --> 15:00.567
- Seriously?
- And I want you to know that

15:00.600 --> 15:03.270
I don't expect you to tell me
why you need the money,

15:03.303 --> 15:05.605
but I am available
to you as a friend.

15:05.638 --> 15:07.574
And that's the last thing
I will say.

15:07.607 --> 15:08.575
[elevator dings]

15:08.608 --> 15:10.710
*

15:10.743 --> 15:13.947
Okay, the last thing I'll say
is, I think it would be a shame

15:13.981 --> 15:16.283
if a misunderstanding
that was born out of love

15:16.316 --> 15:18.385
had a negative effect
on a blossoming friendship

15:18.418 --> 15:20.287
that could be great
for the both of us.

15:20.320 --> 15:22.389
- There is nothing
blossoming here.

15:22.422 --> 15:24.524
We work together.
That's it.

15:24.557 --> 15:27.027
I don't want you
butting into my life.

15:27.060 --> 15:29.296
Leave me alone.
- Jackie, wait--

15:29.329 --> 15:31.431
- I don't need your help.

15:33.666 --> 15:34.634
[rumbling]

15:34.667 --> 15:36.603
[evil laughter]

15:36.636 --> 15:39.039
- Citizens of Charm City,

15:39.072 --> 15:42.642
where is your beloved
Crimson Fox now?

15:42.675 --> 15:45.645
[explosion, glass shattering]

15:45.678 --> 15:48.348
Buckle up!
[laughs evilly]

15:51.351 --> 15:53.053
[light music]

15:53.086 --> 15:54.587
- You just got a little bump
on the head.

15:54.621 --> 15:55.755
You're all set to leave.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.057
We called
your emergency contact.

15:57.090 --> 15:58.525
- My emergency contact?

15:58.558 --> 16:00.693
Who did I put down for my--

16:00.727 --> 16:01.694
Oh, no.

16:01.728 --> 16:03.430
- Jackie!

16:03.463 --> 16:06.566
I am so flattered and also
so glad you're okay.

16:06.599 --> 16:08.735
- Calm down;
I had to put somebody down,

16:08.768 --> 16:11.438
and you're kind of sort of
reliable and capable

16:11.471 --> 16:13.773
in a middle school
hall monitor kind of way.

16:13.806 --> 16:16.076
- Oh, locker break-ins
dropped 24% on my watch.

16:16.109 --> 16:18.078
- I have no doubt they did.

16:18.111 --> 16:20.480
- Look, I know
I overstepped my bounds--

16:20.513 --> 16:22.082
- Yeah, you did.

16:22.115 --> 16:26.653
But maybe I have too many
bounds to step over.

16:26.686 --> 16:29.289
So do you want to know
what that money's for?

16:29.322 --> 16:30.657
- I mean--

16:30.690 --> 16:32.559
- Night classes.

16:32.592 --> 16:34.794
I don't want to spend the rest
of my life helping Van

16:34.827 --> 16:38.465
with his poop witch-hunts,
so I'm trying to get my MBA.

16:38.498 --> 16:39.666
I didn't want
to tell you because--

16:39.699 --> 16:42.102
- Oh, my God, Jackie,
that is so amazing.

16:42.135 --> 16:43.503
- Because of that.

16:43.536 --> 16:45.038
I don't like
that kind of attention.

16:45.072 --> 16:47.474
- The attention of people
who love and care for you?

16:47.507 --> 16:49.109
- I'm not saying it's healthy.

16:49.142 --> 16:51.511
If I'm being honest,
it would probably be good for me

16:51.544 --> 16:54.381
to be friends
with someone like you.

16:54.414 --> 16:57.117
But if you could just turn
the volume down a little?

16:57.150 --> 16:59.686
You want people to lean in,
not lean out.

16:59.719 --> 17:02.522
- See, I like having a friend
who can tell me that.

17:02.555 --> 17:04.790
- And I like having a friend
who would probably notice

17:04.824 --> 17:06.693
if I was dead in my apartment.

17:06.726 --> 17:08.060
- Well, what about your kid?

17:08.095 --> 17:09.128
- She has an iPad.

17:09.162 --> 17:11.330
- Oh.

17:11.364 --> 17:14.601
Could we maybe, like, hug?

17:14.634 --> 17:15.801
- Make it quick.

17:17.804 --> 17:19.539
- Oh, really quick.

17:21.473 --> 17:25.444
* Oh, Jackie
is getting her MBA *

17:25.478 --> 17:26.779
- * And she
- Turn it down.

17:26.813 --> 17:29.416
- [whispering]
* Called me as her emergency

17:29.449 --> 17:30.683
- Turn it off.
- Contact.

17:30.717 --> 17:33.553
- Drive me home.
- Anytime.

17:33.586 --> 17:35.555
- How much
for the Eames lounger?

17:35.588 --> 17:38.158
Okay, and can I get that
with a cup holder?

17:38.191 --> 17:40.527
- Traitor and tacky.

17:40.560 --> 17:41.794
- Hey, what's happening?

17:41.828 --> 17:43.430
- Oh, I'll tell you
what's happening.

17:43.463 --> 17:44.864
Wendy's weak, and she
sold one of us out

17:44.897 --> 17:46.433
for a fricking gift card.

17:46.466 --> 17:48.368
- I did not sell anybody out.

17:48.401 --> 17:50.437
I bet you're the one
who used Van's toilet

17:50.470 --> 17:52.539
and you're trying
to throw people off the scent

17:52.572 --> 17:53.740
by blaming me.

17:53.773 --> 17:55.575
- You know I can't
use a work bathroom.

17:55.608 --> 17:57.544
That's why I have to drive home
at lunch every day.

17:57.577 --> 17:59.179
- And you know that I can't
go to the bathroom

17:59.212 --> 18:00.647
unless there are
people around

18:00.680 --> 18:03.183
to give me a sense
of comfort and security.

18:03.216 --> 18:04.851
You've been there!
- I do know that.

18:04.884 --> 18:06.653
That's a very strange thing.
- Well, does that--

18:06.686 --> 18:07.720
- Enough!

18:07.754 --> 18:09.589
We're all friends here,

18:09.622 --> 18:12.125
and Van is tearing us apart.

18:12.159 --> 18:13.660
And I'm putting an end to it.

18:13.693 --> 18:16.663
*

18:16.696 --> 18:18.865
- * You put the pig
in the pit *

18:18.898 --> 18:20.833
* And then you eat it

18:20.867 --> 18:22.569
* It's just indigenous

18:22.602 --> 18:24.204
* It's not mischievous

18:24.237 --> 18:25.705
- Van?

18:25.738 --> 18:27.607
I pooped in your toilet.

18:27.640 --> 18:31.778
- Finally, the truth comes out.

18:31.811 --> 18:35.782
Ron, your punishment will be
of biblical proportions.

18:35.815 --> 18:38.218
- Van, I pooped
in your toilet.

18:38.251 --> 18:40.487
- No, I pooped
in your toilet.

18:40.520 --> 18:44.591
- All three of you
defecated in my toilet?

18:44.624 --> 18:47.494
Simultaneously?

18:47.527 --> 18:49.762
You are some dirty birdies.

18:49.796 --> 18:51.864
- No, this is a gesture.
We're sticking together.

18:51.898 --> 18:53.500
If you want to punish
one of us,

18:53.533 --> 18:54.734
you're gonna have
to punish us all.

18:54.767 --> 18:56.236
Haven't you ever seen
"Spartacus"?

18:56.269 --> 18:58.605
- Thank you for ruining
"Spartacus" for me.

18:58.638 --> 18:59.772
[computer pings]

18:59.806 --> 19:03.543
Ah, they found
the security footage

19:03.576 --> 19:05.512
of who crapped up my toilet.

19:05.545 --> 19:07.814
Now we'll know for sure.

19:07.847 --> 19:10.550
Jackie, there's a bee!
It looks stingy!

19:10.583 --> 19:11.718
Okay, ignore that.

19:11.751 --> 19:12.852
[laughter]

19:12.885 --> 19:14.521
Jackie!

19:14.554 --> 19:15.922
I'm meditating.
Jackie, is it on me?

19:15.955 --> 19:17.790
It was above the desk!

19:17.824 --> 19:19.526
It's in the room!

19:19.559 --> 19:20.860
Do you see it?

19:20.893 --> 19:22.529
- Huh.

19:22.562 --> 19:24.631
[thud]

19:24.664 --> 19:25.932
- Did you get it?

19:25.965 --> 19:27.734
- It's dead.
- Oh.

19:27.767 --> 19:30.537
- So no one pooped
in your toilet.

19:30.570 --> 19:32.272
- Thank you.
- Jackie just used that magazine

19:32.305 --> 19:34.507
to kill a bee
and left it there.

19:35.575 --> 19:37.544
- That's right.

19:37.577 --> 19:39.779
I knew this all along.

19:39.812 --> 19:44.751
This was me teaching you
a very convoluted lesson...

19:44.784 --> 19:45.952
about friendship.

19:45.985 --> 19:48.955
- Hmm.
- Thank you.

19:48.988 --> 19:51.958
[playful music]

19:53.860 --> 19:55.295
- Look at us.

19:55.328 --> 19:56.829
- I'm only wearing this
because I got

19:56.863 --> 19:58.665
the instructor's blood
on the other one.

19:58.698 --> 20:01.968
- Ooh, sexy ladies
wearing matching shirts.

20:02.001 --> 20:04.571
Hey, how about
a matching foot-long?

20:04.604 --> 20:05.672
[chuckles]

20:05.705 --> 20:06.673
What the--

20:06.706 --> 20:07.707
Ow, ow!

20:07.740 --> 20:09.709
- This stops now.

20:09.742 --> 20:11.678
- Yeah, Tony, you got that?

20:11.711 --> 20:13.880
- [squeaky voice] I got it.
Let go, please. It hurts.

20:13.913 --> 20:15.582
[whimpers]

20:15.615 --> 20:17.984
[dramatic music]

20:18.017 --> 20:19.786
- You know this is
our last Tony dog, right?

20:19.819 --> 20:21.588
- Yeah, I know.

20:21.621 --> 20:22.955
It's so hard to divorce
the artist from his work.

20:22.989 --> 20:24.857
- Mm-hmm.

20:24.891 --> 20:26.326
Mmm.

20:26.359 --> 20:27.860
- But it's so good.
- It's so good!

20:27.894 --> 20:28.895
[suspenseful music]

20:28.928 --> 20:31.898
[video squealing]

20:31.931 --> 20:38.905
*

20:56.022 --> 20:58.024
- My name is Peter.

20:58.057 --> 21:03.530
*

21:04.597 --> 21:05.865
- Ha. That's funny.
