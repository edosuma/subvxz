03:08.580 --> 03:11.097

or the romans?

I'm not afraid of daddy.

Malcolm will not understand.

03:39.887 --> 03:42.721
All this could be yours one day.

If your father finds out
what you've done,

What you want to continue doing,
it's over for you.

03:48.620 --> 03:49.811

04:59.967 --> 05:03.302
Daddy and alicia
had an affair.

05:03.529 --> 05:05.620
Not exactly.

05:05.714 --> 05:07.973
But then how can
what you say be true?

05:08.200 --> 05:14.462
Their relations were not...
Mutually agreed to.

05:14.481 --> 05:16.815
Alicia found herself pregnant.

05:17.042 --> 05:19.042
Garland had been dead
for too long.

05:19.135 --> 05:23.396
There was no way to pass
you off as his.

05:23.549 --> 05:26.716
So, she abandoned me to you.

05:26.735 --> 05:28.952
She didn't have a choice
in the matter.

05:30.238 --> 05:31.237
We didn't give her one.

05:31.390 --> 05:32.572
So, you took her child?

05:32.666 --> 05:35.983
I saved her name, and yours
for that matter.

05:36.003 --> 05:37.336
And your own.

05:37.563 --> 05:39.320
We're all foxworths.

05:39.340 --> 05:40.988
And being a foxworth
still means something

05:41.083 --> 05:42.174
Because of what we did
for you.

05:42.325 --> 05:44.176
How we sacrificed for you.

05:44.327 --> 05:46.160
A life of lies
is not a sacrifice.

discussed here,

a word of it

of you.

Christopher, if you'll retire
to your room

06:04.681 --> 06:06.990

with my daughter.

but you are of my heart.

06:22.532 --> 06:25.884

in my power

from the world

I love you.

it's that simple
