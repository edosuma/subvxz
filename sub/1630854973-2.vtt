-  Oh my God!

02:21.333 --> 02:23.125
That was amazing, Elvis!

02:24.333 --> 02:26.666
Elvis, not bad for a white boy.

02:26.666 --> 02:28.000
Oh, you know it, Redd.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.291
Groovy, baby.

02:29.791 --> 02:31.291
Love the kung fu.

02:31.291 --> 02:32.625
Yeah, Sammy.

02:32.625 --> 02:34.333
Heh, careful of those hips, King.

02:34.333 --> 02:36.916
You'll put an eye out.
And Sammy only has one left.

02:36.916 --> 02:39.250
Hey, thank you, guys. Thanks for coming.

02:40.583 --> 02:42.791
Well, hey, 'Cilla. You made it.

02:42.791 --> 02:45.000
Great show, Satnin. I loved it.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.583
And love you.

02:47.958 --> 02:49.583
The karate was different.

02:49.583 --> 02:52.291
- Yeah, sorry about that, Ronnie.

02:52.291 --> 02:53.666
All good.

02:53.666 --> 02:55.041
Walk it off, big guy.

02:55.041 --> 02:56.333
He's gonna be okay, right?

02:56.333 --> 02:58.166
Oh shit, yeah. Ronnie's a pro.

03:07.458 --> 03:10.666
So, what the hell's going on
inside that head of yours?

03:13.291 --> 03:14.916
- Ah!
- Okay, full disclosure:

03:14.916 --> 03:18.041
slept through most of the show,
but loved where you freaked the fuck out.

03:18.041 --> 03:19.666
Jesus! You again?

03:19.666 --> 03:21.583
How the hell
did you get in here past security?

03:21.583 --> 03:23.000
Those are your security guys?

03:23.000 --> 03:24.458
Huh. Adorable.

03:26.291 --> 03:29.000
Oh relax. They're still alive, probably.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.208
What are you doing here?

03:30.208 --> 03:33.041
Only the most insanely boring job ever:
errand girl.

03:33.041 --> 03:34.541
I'm taking you to meet my boss.

03:35.958 --> 03:36.875
Your boss?

03:36.875 --> 03:39.583
Now why in the hell would I do that?
Who do you even work for?

03:39.583 --> 03:43.166
Not authorized to tell you that,
but he is dying to meet you.

03:43.166 --> 03:44.666
Yeah, I get that a lot.

03:44.666 --> 03:45.666
I'm not interested.

03:45.666 --> 03:48.375
Hey, you owe me for saving your butt
at that Manson thing.

03:48.375 --> 03:50.625
Ha! More like
the other way around, friend.

03:52.041 --> 03:53.291
Hey, lady, you can't--

03:54.708 --> 03:55.625
Fuck!

03:55.625 --> 03:59.250
You score me one of those zapper guns,
and I'll meet your boss.

03:59.250 --> 04:01.875
- Done.
- Never caught your name, by the way.

04:01.875 --> 04:03.875
- It's CeCe with an E.
- As opposed to?

04:03.875 --> 04:07.541
An I, which is how you'd spell it if
you were a coked-up stripper like my mom,

04:07.541 --> 04:09.583
which I am not, thank you,
so I spell it with an E.

04:09.583 --> 04:10.625
Already bored.

04:14.958 --> 04:16.875
So, where are we going again?

04:16.875 --> 04:18.916
- Don't worry about it.
- And we're meeting who now?

04:18.916 --> 04:20.000
Don't worry about it.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.750
And we're leaving Scatter here by himself?

04:22.750 --> 04:24.250
Now that we may want to worry about.

04:24.833 --> 04:26.375
Back in a couple hours, Scatter.

04:26.375 --> 04:27.458
Stay in the room.

04:27.458 --> 04:30.208

05:23.041 --> 05:25.458
Technically, chimpanzees are apes.

05:27.291 --> 05:28.208
See?

05:28.208 --> 05:30.458
I don't care what it is.
Just get it out of here.

05:30.458 --> 05:33.166
Whoa, whoa, whoa, that's not a monkey.

05:33.166 --> 05:35.125
That's Mr. Presley's monkey.

05:37.250 --> 05:40.083
My apologies. Anything you need, just ask.

05:40.083 --> 05:42.000
We'll charge it to Mr. Presley's room.

05:48.458 --> 05:50.541
Holy shit.

05:50.541 --> 05:52.291
Would you look at that, E?

05:54.625 --> 05:57.000
-  What is this place?
-  It doesn't have a name,

05:57.000 --> 05:58.125
or even exist, technically.

05:58.125 --> 06:01.625
Got it. More of that
top-secret bullshit you've been selling.

06:01.625 --> 06:04.041
I'll take that zapper gun now, by the way.

06:04.583 --> 06:06.791
Now careful with this thing.
Let me walk you through it.

06:06.791 --> 06:09.500
Safety off, set the charge and...

06:12.000 --> 06:13.541
Yep. Think I got it.

06:13.541 --> 06:15.875
- So, where's this boss of yours?
- He'll be here any minute.

06:15.875 --> 06:18.875
He's flying in from Monte Carlo,
had to have a little chat with JFK.

06:18.875 --> 06:22.125
Uh, JFK is dead.
It was a goddamn national tragedy.

06:22.125 --> 06:23.208
Oh.

06:23.208 --> 06:25.875
That's right. He's, uh... He's "dead."

06:25.875 --> 06:27.041
I keep forgetting that.

06:27.041 --> 06:28.500
And you're saying he's not?

06:28.500 --> 06:30.458
You shouldn't believe
everything you see on TV.

06:31.083 --> 06:34.125
Hey! Don't you dare ruin
<i>Hawaii Five-O</i> for me, lady.

06:34.125 --> 06:36.500
Kinda getting a little bored here,
CeCe with an E.

06:36.500 --> 06:37.625
All right. Wait, wait.

06:37.625 --> 06:40.458
At least check out the plane first.
My boss thinks you might like it.

06:40.458 --> 06:42.166
We can go on that thing? Ha!

06:42.166 --> 06:44.416
Well, hell! Lead with that next time.

06:44.416 --> 06:46.875
Ah, ah, ah. Not so fast, string bean.

06:46.875 --> 06:48.000
This is classified.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.416
And that goes for my purse too,
so keep your weirdly small hands off.

06:57.666 --> 06:59.041
Classified, my ass.

06:59.833 --> 07:01.708
Besides, peeking ain't cheating.

07:04.416 --> 07:07.625
And I thought my jet,
the <i>Lisa Marie,</i> was tricked out. Ha!

07:07.625 --> 07:08.875
Oh!

07:08.875 --> 07:11.791
Who's this Lisa Marie? She sounds hot.

07:12.291 --> 07:14.083
- My daughter.
-  Oh!

07:14.083 --> 07:17.208
This guy named his daughter
after his plane?

07:17.208 --> 07:20.125
Weird priorities, but I love it.

07:20.125 --> 07:23.166
Uh, just a heads-up,
but you got a creepy homeless guy

07:23.166 --> 07:25.458
pissing in a jar
in the middle of your spy plane.

07:25.458 --> 07:28.041
Creepy is correct, yes,
but definitely not homeless.

07:28.041 --> 07:30.208
Howard is a billionaire
and a genius inventor.

07:30.208 --> 07:32.666
- He works for us.
- Howard Hughes. Nice to meet you.

07:32.666 --> 07:33.791
Howard Hughes?

07:33.791 --> 07:35.500
Hell, I'd heard you gone insane.

07:35.500 --> 07:38.125
And I must say,
based on your wall of piss over there,

07:38.125 --> 07:40.541
- I'm guessing I heard correctly.

07:40.541 --> 07:42.750
You sound like all of my doctors.

07:42.750 --> 07:46.375
Truth be told, I'm completely insane...

07:46.375 --> 07:48.958
Wait a minute. I'm completely insane...

07:48.958 --> 07:50.541
Wait, nope. That's not right.

07:50.541 --> 07:53.291
I'm completely <i>not</i> insane.

07:53.291 --> 07:55.333
Mm-hmm. Well, then what's with the jars?

07:55.333 --> 07:56.916
No bathrooms on the plane?

07:56.916 --> 07:58.541
It actually has six.

07:58.541 --> 08:01.291
Three for number twos,
two for number ones,

08:01.291 --> 08:03.583
and one that's just full of jars.

08:03.583 --> 08:05.250
This plane has everything.

08:05.250 --> 08:06.958
It's even nuclear-powered.

08:06.958 --> 08:09.291
I built a reactor in the back. Imagine it.

08:09.291 --> 08:11.000
Never has to refuel.

08:11.000 --> 08:15.833
A permanent TCB headquarters in the air,
with six bathrooms.

08:15.833 --> 08:16.750
TCB?

08:16.750 --> 08:18.416
Yeah, pretend you didn't hear that.

08:18.416 --> 08:21.416
Ooh! How about a tour?
We can start at the cockpit.

08:21.416 --> 08:23.291
It's the coolest part,

08:23.291 --> 08:25.291
mostly 'cause of the word "cock."

08:27.875 --> 08:32.125
Hey, anyone ever tell you
you look like poor man's Elvis Presley?

08:33.375 --> 08:34.458
Bulletproof.

08:34.458 --> 08:38.375
No shit. I was rage shooting, dumbass,
but we can't let them hijack this plane.

08:38.375 --> 08:41.833
Well, unless you got spy lipstick
that's secretly a blowtorch or something--

08:41.833 --> 08:43.500
- Oh, fuck me!
- What?

08:43.500 --> 08:45.666
I left the blowtorch cigarettes
in my purse.

08:45.666 --> 08:46.583
Oh!

08:54.833 --> 08:56.541
Now, where the hell are they going?

08:57.041 --> 08:57.875
Hey!

08:57.875 --> 08:59.708
You fellas have any idea...

08:59.708 --> 09:01.541
where the back of your fucking heads went?

09:04.166 --> 09:05.583
Well, this ain't good.

09:07.291 --> 09:08.958
Hello, Louise.

09:11.375 --> 09:13.041
Uh, let's do the math here.

09:13.041 --> 09:16.791
Reinforced steel door versus
little lady with a fire extinguisher.

09:17.291 --> 09:18.416
My money's on the door.

09:18.416 --> 09:21.375
Oh, hey there, chauvinism!
Perfect timing, dick.

09:21.375 --> 09:23.000
<i>This is captain speaking.</i>

09:23.000 --> 09:28.208
<i>So sorry if Elvis is all shaking up
in his blue suede booties.</i>

09:28.208 --> 09:29.833
It's "shoes," dumbass.

09:29.833 --> 09:32.541
Oh, there's your fan base right there:
asshole bad guys.

09:32.541 --> 09:36.166
I'm not gonna apologize
for my universal appeal.

09:36.166 --> 09:41.541
<i>Sorry for this, but now is it time for you
to be going to the heartburn hotel, eh?</i>

09:41.541 --> 09:44.208
Uh, okay, language barrier aside,

09:44.208 --> 09:48.125
the takeaway here is
Elvis fans are worldwide--

09:52.708 --> 09:54.500
- Doyle.
- Yes, Commander?

09:56.625 --> 09:58.750
Is my watch running fast, Doyle?

09:58.750 --> 10:00.375
- No, it is not, sir.
- Didn't think so.

10:00.375 --> 10:03.208
And CeCe was told to report to me,
with Elvis,

10:03.208 --> 10:06.541
promptly at the airfield
at 0300 hours, correct?

10:06.541 --> 10:09.583
- Indeed, sir.
- And yet, somehow, they're not here.

10:10.166 --> 10:13.166
Are they perhaps
employing a cloaking device?

10:13.166 --> 10:14.541
Uh, I'm sorry?

10:14.541 --> 10:16.375
You know, a cloaking device.

10:16.375 --> 10:18.250
Is it possible
they're standing right here,

10:18.250 --> 10:21.333
but they're invisible thanks to a new,
experimental cloaking device

10:21.333 --> 10:22.791
that has malfunctioned,

10:22.791 --> 10:24.708
and they can't
make themselves visible again?

10:24.708 --> 10:27.791
Because that's literally
the only explanation I can come up with.

10:27.791 --> 10:28.708
Uh...

10:28.708 --> 10:30.458
I do not believe we've invented

10:30.458 --> 10:32.250
- a cloaking device, sir.
- I didn't think so.

10:32.250 --> 10:35.291
If we had, it'd be a very different world,
wouldn't it, Doyle?

10:35.291 --> 10:38.416
I could be standing right next
to an attractive man in the restroom

10:38.416 --> 10:40.916
to watch him urinate,
and he wouldn't even know I'm there.

10:41.416 --> 10:43.416
Now, I'm just picking
something at random, of course.

10:43.416 --> 10:45.500
Obviously, the possibilities are endless.

10:45.500 --> 10:49.208
So, now I seem to have
two reasons to be enraged.

10:49.208 --> 10:50.500
There's no Elvis here,

10:50.500 --> 10:54.666
and we are apparently way fucking behind
on developing cloaking devices!

10:54.666 --> 10:57.666
Remind me to let CeCe know
she's now in a world of--

10:58.250 --> 11:01.375
Shit!

11:01.375 --> 11:04.250
Hey, hey, hey! Going my way?

11:04.250 --> 11:06.875
Well, if your way
is straight down to a splattery death,

11:06.875 --> 11:08.833
then yes, as a matter of fact, I am.

11:08.833 --> 11:10.791
Nobody's gonna be splattering anywhere.

11:10.791 --> 11:14.250
Okay. Your cape,
while very showy and vaguely feminine,

11:14.250 --> 11:15.583
isn't gonna break our fall.

11:15.583 --> 11:18.458
- You're right, but he will.
- Who?

11:18.458 --> 11:19.416
My boy, my boy.

11:29.333 --> 11:30.625
Oh.

11:30.625 --> 11:32.250
You are so my new favorite.

11:33.333 --> 11:34.791
Whoo! Nice plane, Bobby.

11:34.791 --> 11:38.083
- Yeah! Even has a cup holder.
- Where the hell did you learn to fly?

11:38.083 --> 11:41.041
Bobby Ray here can drive,
fly, and ride just about anything.

11:41.041 --> 11:44.541
I guess your little Memphis Mafia boys
come in handy, don't they?

11:44.541 --> 11:45.833
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:45.833 --> 11:48.166
No, Bobby Ray is not my Memphis Mafia.

11:48.166 --> 11:50.625
- Hoping to get in one day though.
- Uh, yeah.

11:50.625 --> 11:52.875
Tell you what,
how about we play it by ear there, buddy?

11:52.875 --> 11:53.791
Yeah, okay, good.

11:53.791 --> 11:56.208
And in the meantime, how about
we follow that hijacked plane?

11:56.208 --> 11:58.041
-  Not a problem.

11:58.041 --> 11:59.333
Well, that doesn't sound good.

11:59.333 --> 12:01.333
Don't worry. Bobby Ray can fix anything.

12:01.333 --> 12:03.625
Hey, anybody got a shit-ton of gasoline?

12:03.625 --> 12:04.875
Asking for a friend.

12:08.708 --> 12:09.625
Yeah.

12:09.625 --> 12:11.625
This is good, Bertie. This is real nice.

12:11.625 --> 12:13.583
Yeah, I don't know if you know this,

12:13.583 --> 12:16.416
but I was one of the first Black men
to ever play Vegas.

12:16.416 --> 12:19.250
I love this town.
White folks here give me whatever I want,

12:19.250 --> 12:21.875
mostly because they assume
all Black people carry a knife.

12:21.875 --> 12:22.958
They wrong.

12:22.958 --> 12:24.000
I carry a pistol.

12:26.916 --> 12:28.833
Oh, oh. Hey there. Excuse me. Yeah.

12:28.833 --> 12:34.666
Could I get a virgin daiquiri with one
of those adorable little umbrellas in it?

12:35.291 --> 12:39.416
Oh, and three shots of tequila,
and whatever Mr. Foxx here wants.

12:39.416 --> 12:42.291
Sorry, ma'am, but your account
has been flagged as over the limit.

12:42.291 --> 12:45.083
I'm on the Elvis Presley account.

12:45.083 --> 12:48.125
There is, by definition, no limit.

12:48.125 --> 12:51.750
Apparently there is, and it's $302,000.

12:51.750 --> 12:53.458
What the hell?

12:53.458 --> 12:55.875
Did the Colonel gamble away all of this?

12:55.875 --> 12:59.333
I believe it was another member
of your party, a Mr. Scatter.

12:59.916 --> 13:03.333
Oh. You mean the chimp
I'm about to murder.

13:03.333 --> 13:04.416
Easy.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.041
Easy.

13:20.291 --> 13:21.166
Easy.

13:27.083 --> 13:29.916
- See? Easy--
- Say "easy" again. I fucking dare you.

13:29.916 --> 13:32.166
Easy, CeCe with an E.

13:32.750 --> 13:34.000
Now, where the hell are we?

13:40.208 --> 13:42.333
- Hey there, what are you doing?

13:42.333 --> 13:44.333
Trying to fix this thing.

13:44.333 --> 13:46.458
It'll pick up the tracking device
I left on the plane.

13:46.458 --> 13:48.791
- You always carry one?
- I like to know where things are.

13:48.791 --> 13:50.375
Hijacked planes, ex-boyfriends,

13:50.375 --> 13:52.958
my shitty dog,
ex-boyfriend's even shittier dog.

13:52.958 --> 13:56.250
- Well, would you look at that? Ha!

13:56.250 --> 13:58.083
I'm even on
out here in the middle of nowhere.

13:58.083 --> 14:01.000
Fitting, out here
with all the other dusty antiques, gramps.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.166
I'm 33.

14:02.166 --> 14:03.250
Oh yikes.

14:03.791 --> 14:06.375
Okay, look,
your music's just not my thing. I'm sorry.

14:06.375 --> 14:08.125
- That's literally not poss--
- Give me that.

14:09.583 --> 14:11.708
- Here we go.

14:11.708 --> 14:13.291
Can't get away from that damn song.

14:13.291 --> 14:15.416
Uh-huh. That's because
everybody loves them.

14:15.416 --> 14:19.333
Kinda like your stuff way back when,
like, during the Roaring '20s or whatever.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.708
Wait, did they have radios back then?

14:27.500 --> 14:29.208
My thoughts exactly.

14:31.083 --> 14:33.250
Scatter, you damn fool.

14:33.250 --> 14:34.833
How drunk are you?

14:36.708 --> 14:37.833
- Ah, ah.

14:37.833 --> 14:40.000
Don't you dare pass out on me.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.750
For all of your NASA training,

14:41.750 --> 14:44.083
you sure as hell
ain't no rocket scientist.

14:44.083 --> 14:46.250
More like a furry fucking moron.

14:46.250 --> 14:48.416
Get your nasty ass out of here.

14:48.958 --> 14:52.625
Now, let's go win Elvis his money back.

14:53.208 --> 14:55.958
Great, there goes the neighborhood.

14:56.500 --> 14:58.375
Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:58.375 --> 15:00.208
So, we making this a Black thing now?

15:00.208 --> 15:01.958
You playing, or you talking?

15:01.958 --> 15:05.375
I'm gonna enjoy beating your cracker ass.

15:05.375 --> 15:06.416
Deal.

15:14.750 --> 15:17.916
Hey, hey, hey.
Looks like Bobby Ray got the power on.

15:17.916 --> 15:19.458
- Oh, hey! Same here.

15:19.458 --> 15:21.041
I think I got this thing working.

15:22.333 --> 15:23.500
Oh, nice ride.

15:23.500 --> 15:27.208
Oh, you ain't seen nothing.
I souped this baby up.

15:29.625 --> 15:32.291
- Doesn't actually make it go faster, but...
- Hey, guys?

15:32.291 --> 15:34.666
...worth it, though,
because it makes it look shit-hot.

15:34.666 --> 15:36.333
- Agreed.
- Hey, guys.

15:36.333 --> 15:38.083
This is weird. According to my tracker,

15:38.083 --> 15:40.375
the plane's on the ground,
and I mean like right over...

15:40.375 --> 15:41.833
Oh fuck me.

16:00.125 --> 16:02.000
- Did I get one?
- Yep.

16:05.541 --> 16:06.541
Wakey, wakey.

16:07.291 --> 16:08.333
Hey, guys?

16:08.333 --> 16:09.583
Hey, wake the fuck up!

16:11.208 --> 16:12.125
Where are we?

16:12.666 --> 16:14.583
Goddamn commies.

16:14.583 --> 16:16.500
Probably halfway to Russia by now.

16:16.500 --> 16:19.625
No, not Russia, Vegas. I heard them
talking while you two were out cold.

16:19.625 --> 16:22.291
You both snore like basset hounds
with asthma, by the way.

16:22.291 --> 16:23.875
Hold up. You speak Russki?

16:23.875 --> 16:27.333
And eight other languages.
Nine if a safe word in Portuguese counts.

16:27.333 --> 16:29.875
But these guys switched to French
when they saw me listening.

16:29.875 --> 16:31.625
I don't think
they're Russian agents at all.

16:31.625 --> 16:33.208
They're something else altogether.

16:33.208 --> 16:36.833
Why hijack a plane
just to fly it back to Vegas?

16:36.833 --> 16:39.625
Uh, simple. To vaporize it.

16:39.625 --> 16:41.041
Okay.

16:41.041 --> 16:44.000
I can see from the confused faces
that I forgot to mention

16:44.000 --> 16:47.958
that they made me turn the nuclear reactor
in the plane into a nuclear bomb.

16:47.958 --> 16:49.666
- You what?
-"You what"?!

16:49.666 --> 16:51.250
They had a gun to my head!

16:51.250 --> 16:53.083
Nuke Vegas? Why?

16:53.083 --> 16:56.583
I'm assuming so that they can
wipe out that fuck Wayne Newton.

16:56.583 --> 16:58.500
But it could also be

16:58.500 --> 17:03.375
that they know TCB secretly runs
all of Vegas as a revenue source.

17:03.375 --> 17:05.041
Ew. Pretend you didn't hear that.

17:05.541 --> 17:07.041
Oh my God.

17:07.041 --> 17:09.208
Priscilla. She's still in Vegas.

17:10.458 --> 17:14.416
Sorry, just, it's funny because
technically, you know, not for long.

17:14.416 --> 17:18.333
For the record, I told you building
a nuclear plane was a terrible idea.

17:18.333 --> 17:21.041
So? Everybody did!

17:21.041 --> 17:22.833
You're not special!

17:22.833 --> 17:23.875
Shut up!

17:23.875 --> 17:26.875
What we need to do
is get out of these chains now.

17:26.875 --> 17:28.291
That I can do.

17:28.791 --> 17:31.166
I just need a little help
getting my dick out.

17:32.041 --> 17:34.333
A little help getting a what now out?

17:34.333 --> 17:37.666
Okay, hmm. I guess I'm going
to have to tell this story.

17:37.666 --> 17:42.000
So, I injected myself
with radiation years ago.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.875
- Why?
- Well, in my defense,

17:43.875 --> 17:48.250
turns out the Spider-Man origin story
is complete bullshit.

17:48.250 --> 17:50.625
Which you did not know at the time?

17:50.625 --> 17:51.666
How could I?

17:51.666 --> 17:53.583
It's a total con job.

17:53.583 --> 17:56.750
No kick-ass spiderwebs,
can't climb walls for shit.

17:56.750 --> 18:00.041
All I got was
razor-sharp fingernails you can't cut,

18:00.041 --> 18:02.416
and urine that's basically acid,

18:02.416 --> 18:05.666
which is why I use the jars:
to save the plumbing.

18:06.250 --> 18:08.708
So, uh, which one of you
is going to aim it for me?

18:09.708 --> 18:11.791
Goddamn, it sucks up here.

18:12.375 --> 18:16.708
See? I used to play in our church basement
with folks from the congregation.

18:16.708 --> 18:18.291
Just for toothpicks, of course.

18:18.291 --> 18:22.458
Eventually, I talked them into playing
a money game though.

18:22.458 --> 18:24.958
And now? I own the church.

18:32.166 --> 18:33.125
Dealer busts.

18:34.625 --> 18:37.833
Like taking candy from a baby.

18:38.708 --> 18:42.583
Well, assuming babies can be
asshole, racist blackjack dealers.

18:43.083 --> 18:43.916
Ha!

18:43.916 --> 18:46.375
Yeah, that's right. You better walk away!

18:47.291 --> 18:49.500
Was tired of winning money
from him anyhow.

18:51.166 --> 18:52.041
Oh come on.

18:52.541 --> 18:55.625
He's not asking for a reach-around.
Just aim the guy's dick.

18:55.625 --> 18:57.083
Well, you work with the guy.

18:57.083 --> 18:59.541
Yeah, that is textbook
workplace-inappropriate.

18:59.541 --> 19:00.916
Fine. Bobby Ray, you're up.

19:00.916 --> 19:02.625
You got it, E. Wait, what now?

19:02.625 --> 19:07.708
Hero time, buddy. Time to buck up.
You were made to do this. Know that.

19:07.708 --> 19:10.500
But mostly, you do it so I don't have to.

19:14.583 --> 19:17.000
Can we hurry this up?
Because we've got company.

19:17.583 --> 19:18.916
Oh! Cold hands! Cold hands!

19:18.916 --> 19:21.458
- Stop fucking around, damn it!

19:21.458 --> 19:23.333
Hey, hey, hey! Drop the penis.

19:30.166 --> 19:32.250
Now, you guys can disarm that bomb, yeah?

19:32.250 --> 19:33.833
- Not a problem.
- Highly doubt it.

19:34.458 --> 19:36.541
Ah, so what you're saying is,

19:36.541 --> 19:39.500
if we simultaneously cut the lead
to redirect the primer charge,

19:39.500 --> 19:40.791
we can decouple the detonator.

19:40.791 --> 19:44.041
Whoa, you're like
some kind of hillbilly genius.

19:44.041 --> 19:45.125
Something like that.

19:45.125 --> 19:47.708
- Now, where's that no-matter-what wire?
-  The what now?

19:47.708 --> 19:50.708
On every bomb, there's a wire
you don't touch, no matter what.

19:50.708 --> 19:52.458
My Uncle Randy taught me that.

19:53.083 --> 19:55.166
Those were his final words, actually.

19:55.166 --> 19:57.875
Okay, and yours too
if you idiots don't hurry the fuck up.

19:57.875 --> 19:59.583

21:03.541 --> 21:05.583
Very impressive, my friends,

21:05.583 --> 21:10.291
but unfortunately for you,
I have locked the autopilot on Vegas.

21:10.291 --> 21:12.666
So, guess this is goodbye.

21:12.666 --> 21:15.708
For you, it'll be
a little less conversation...

21:17.500 --> 21:19.833
...and a little bit more radiation.

21:19.833 --> 21:22.041
Okay, okay. I'll give you that one.

21:22.041 --> 21:23.375
That was pretty good.

21:23.375 --> 21:28.583
And that officially makes $302,000.

21:28.583 --> 21:29.583
Bam!

21:30.708 --> 21:33.875
Good. Going back
to where you came from, hopefully.

21:34.541 --> 21:38.333
Looks like I'm not done
busting you up after all.

21:39.458 --> 21:42.166
Like my sweet little nephew Wesley says...

21:44.791 --> 21:46.666
always bet on Black.

21:48.166 --> 21:49.291
Heads up!

21:55.375 --> 21:58.583
Damn it, Howard.
I needed that guy alive to question him.

21:58.583 --> 22:00.208
Well, you should have said that!

22:00.208 --> 22:01.958
Oh, and speaking of,

22:01.958 --> 22:04.250
the disarming-the-bomb thing
we were doing?

22:04.250 --> 22:06.375
It didn't go "good."

22:06.375 --> 22:08.500
We are totally fucked!

22:08.500 --> 22:11.375
Shit! And the autopilot's locked
and headed for Vegas.

22:12.708 --> 22:14.375
Not anymore it isn't.

22:15.083 --> 22:16.958
Everybody, grab on.

22:23.125 --> 22:25.666
Okay, who's groping my ass?

22:26.500 --> 22:28.541
Okay, who's not groping my ass?

22:28.541 --> 22:30.125
Uh, probably the dead guy.

22:31.375 --> 22:33.125
I'm actually not dead.

22:33.125 --> 22:34.541
Just badly burnt.

22:34.541 --> 22:37.750
Oh! Oh Christ.
Oh God, it's like talking to a meat loaf.

22:37.750 --> 22:40.583
No, I big fan. Number one Elvis.

22:40.583 --> 22:42.291
That's why I do quotes.

22:42.291 --> 22:44.000
You inspire me.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.875
- Uh, thank you?
- Yeah, that's great. Who do you work for?

22:46.875 --> 22:48.750
You know, maybe this is sign.

22:48.750 --> 22:51.500
I should make changes in life, you know?

22:51.500 --> 22:54.625
Join the carpool, get normal job, eh?

22:54.625 --> 22:58.375
Oh, yeah. Yay for pretty pictures.
Who the fuck do you work for?

22:58.375 --> 23:01.000
Okay, okay. It's too many secrets.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.208
Doesn't matter, so I tell you.

23:03.916 --> 23:05.041
I work for--

23:07.375 --> 23:09.750
Oh, well, that's just fucking great.

23:26.166 --> 23:28.958
And thank the Lord for metaphors!

23:34.791 --> 23:37.083
Your ass needs to see a doctor.

23:37.083 --> 23:38.875
And I mean, like, a ton of 'em.

23:38.875 --> 23:41.625
Ugh. And I'm totally fired, aren't I?

23:41.625 --> 23:42.750
Oh yeah.

23:48.833 --> 23:50.583
- Fuck you, Vegas.

24:04.500 --> 24:07.291
What... Howard? Is that you?

24:07.875 --> 24:09.375
You idiots know each other?

24:09.375 --> 24:10.583
Oh yeah.

24:10.583 --> 24:12.958
Melvin found me
on the side of the road a few years ago

24:12.958 --> 24:14.541
and gave me a ride into town,

24:14.541 --> 24:17.958
so I'm leaving him
all my money when I die.

24:17.958 --> 24:19.750
Uh, just for giving you a ride?

24:19.750 --> 24:21.375
Wait, what do I get for the handy?

24:21.375 --> 24:23.833
Just take me to my hotel, will you?

24:23.833 --> 24:25.458
Yeah, absolutely.

24:25.458 --> 24:27.875
Any chance we could swing by
and meet my boss first?

24:27.875 --> 24:29.416
No, I'm done with you people.

24:29.416 --> 24:30.791
- Well, but--
- Done.

24:32.583 --> 24:34.083
How about some tunes then?

24:37.500 --> 24:38.708

24:39.333 --> 24:40.916
