04:25.431 --> 04:26.332
What's up, Kris?

05:02.468 --> 05:04.404
He looked like he wanted to talk to me.

05:04.470 --> 05:07.307
I don't know what's going on, but I'm
just going to wait over here for a second.

05:10.376 --> 05:11.477
I'm shaking now.

05:11.544 --> 05:12.912
You look fantastic.

05:13.713 --> 05:14.714
Do I look older?

05:15.848 --> 05:17.250
A little white in the beard?

05:32.632 --> 05:35.335
Hey. A lot of that stuff that came out,
they really twist the hell out of it.

05:35.401 --> 05:36.703
I just wanted you to know that.

05:38.638 --> 05:40.807
I sent you e-mails,
and you never responded.

05:46.112 --> 05:47.046
It was good to see you.

05:52.051 --> 05:53.553
I'm not gonna want to let go.

05:57.190 --> 05:58.124
What was it?

06:51.644 --> 06:54.113
<i>Wait. Are you gonna tell Bruce
that you ran into him?</i>

10:46.312 --> 10:47.780
Welcome to STK.

11:41.767 --> 11:44.570
Scott Disick and I will be
on in, like, an hour.

11:44.637 --> 11:45.671
Get your d***s ready.

12:03.589 --> 12:05.858
Anyone ever tell you that you look like
Kim Kardashian?

15:58.357 --> 15:59.358
<i>It's a problem?</i>

16:05.197 --> 16:08.200
<i>Why would I cover up for your boyfriend?</i>

16:08.267 --> 16:10.836
<i>Or try to be shady to my pregnant sister?</i>

17:25.411 --> 17:29.481
"If you really want to reflect
and cover some serious topics,

17:30.482 --> 17:32.184
I'd be open to that."

21:08.800 --> 21:10.435
I used to come here all the time.

21:37.696 --> 21:39.531
Kourtney keeps calling me.

21:40.198 --> 21:42.267
It's too loud to hear anything, though.

21:42.334 --> 21:43.669
Text her back.

21:57.749 --> 22:00.218
Is she really calling you again?

22:00.285 --> 22:01.420
She's still up?

22:01.486 --> 22:03.388
I can't even believe she's still awake.

22:04.122 --> 22:05.724
She's stalking you!

22:20.706 --> 22:22.708
<i>I think I'm just gonna pass out at Kim's,</i>

22:22.774 --> 22:23.875
<i>'cause I had a couple beers,</i>

22:23.942 --> 22:25.844
<i>and I'm not gonna drive home like this.</i>

22:31.983 --> 22:32.884
<i>I'm tired, doll.</i>

22:32.951 --> 22:34.353
<i>We live far away.</i>

22:43.295 --> 22:45.897
<i>Oh, my god, calm down.</i>

22:45.964 --> 22:48.266
<i>I'm at your sister's, relax!</i>

23:01.546 --> 23:04.916
<i>Of course, I'm trying to be a grown man
that's responsible.</i>

27:38.923 --> 27:41.059
They're full of acid.
That's how they test them.

30:54.953 --> 30:55.954
Stop!

30:57.222 --> 30:58.923
We forgot to spray it.

31:30.788 --> 31:33.124
I think that's kinda worse
than the spaghetti.

31:35.493 --> 31:37.395
This is getting worse.

31:37.462 --> 31:39.564
I think we should just leave it
and see if she notices.

31:39.631 --> 31:42.834
And then if she doesâ€¦
tell her what happened.

39:34.138 --> 39:35.373
Something's weird.

39:38.442 --> 39:40.745
I swear, I think she's gonna go see Todd.

39:42.113 --> 39:43.681
Let's go follow her then.
