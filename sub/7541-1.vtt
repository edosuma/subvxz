00:18.151 --> 00:21.951
Cherry Blossoms

00:58.091 --> 01:00.616
I always wanted to
go to Japan with him.

01:00.727 --> 01:04.595
Just to see Mt. Fuji once.
The cherry blossoms. With him.

01:06.066 --> 01:09.365
Because seeing anything without
my husband, I can't even imagine that.

01:09.469 --> 01:12.336
That would be like not really seeing it.

01:12.439 --> 01:14.669
How can I go on living without him?

01:19.245 --> 01:23.944
We wanted to talk it over
with you first.

01:24.050 --> 01:27.952
If you think your husband
can cope with the diagnosis...

01:29.055 --> 01:30.955
people react differently...

01:31.057 --> 01:34.959
How the disease progresses
is hard to tell.

01:35.061 --> 01:37.222
It could be that your husband won't
even have any symptoms for a long time K

01:40.700 --> 01:45.000
You might want to think about
doing something together...

01:45.105 --> 01:46.766
a trip...

01:46.873 --> 01:49.433
something a little adventurous...

02:01.221 --> 02:03.712
My husband hates adventures.

02:08.761 --> 02:10.854
He'd prefer it if
nothing changed. Ever.

02:10.964 --> 02:13.455
Nothing. At all.

02:18.905 --> 02:22.466
Every day he takes
the 7:28 train to Weilheim.

02:44.164 --> 02:46.155
He used to work at the passport office.

02:46.266 --> 02:49.133
Now he's the head of the
waste management department.

02:50.069 --> 02:53.561
Recycling is good.
Reusables are better.

02:53.673 --> 02:55.607
He's only been sick for one week
in twenty years. 1991.

02:55.708 --> 02:58.609
The flu and an eardrum infection.

02:58.711 --> 03:03.580
He eats the sandwich that I make for
him at 1 pm every day and his apple.

03:03.683 --> 03:07.813
"An apple a day keeps the doctor away."
He says that every morning.

03:07.921 --> 03:10.321
Â§An apple a day keeps the doctor away.

03:58.738 --> 03:59.534
Hello, Rudi.

04:04.244 --> 04:05.370
How was your day?

04:05.478 --> 04:06.843
So so...

04:12.252 --> 04:13.378
Yours?

04:13.953 --> 04:14.681
Okay.

04:38.778 --> 04:41.178
Aren't you hungry?
- No.

04:46.319 --> 04:47.946
Down more, Elke!

04:50.723 --> 04:53.317
And with a smile, please!

04:54.260 --> 04:58.026
Everything goes easier with a smile.

04:58.131 --> 05:00.964
And peppy! And down!

05:32.031 --> 05:33.623
Back already?

06:06.265 --> 06:13.398
Karl Angermeier, leave messages
after the beep. Thanks.

06:13.506 --> 06:15.940
Yes, Karl. This is Mama.

06:16.809 --> 06:20.905
I... I wanted to... it's...

06:21.914 --> 06:26.442
everything's okay. Talk to you soon.

06:53.346 --> 06:55.041
Want to visit the children in Berlin?

06:55.148 --> 06:57.275
Berlin? I don't know.

06:57.383 --> 06:59.476
What if we finally went to Japan?

07:00.620 --> 07:03.487
You know...
Fuji's just another mountain.

07:04.857 --> 07:07.690
Yes, but we could visit Karl.

07:07.794 --> 07:09.955
It'd be cheaper if he visited us.

07:10.596 --> 07:11.858
Oh, Rudi!

07:15.201 --> 07:17.795
Shall we go on?

07:19.405 --> 07:20.565
I'm hungry.

08:14.961 --> 08:16.428
Nothing to eat?

08:18.331 --> 08:21.095
Rudi, we haven't been underway
for 5 minutes.

08:29.275 --> 08:32.676
"An apple a day keeps the doctor away."

08:32.778 --> 08:33.710
You want it?

08:33.813 --> 08:35.075
No, not me.

08:35.181 --> 08:36.614
I'll eat it later.

08:47.326 --> 08:51.660
Imagine... the train stops in Hanau
for 2 minutes...

08:51.764 --> 08:54.255
so if you don't get off fast...

09:16.889 --> 09:18.550
He wanted to meet us on the platform!

09:20.393 --> 09:22.554
What time is it? Look at your watch.

09:24.630 --> 09:27.155
I'll give him 5 minutes and then

09:28.034 --> 09:30.002
we'll take a taxi or something.

09:30.102 --> 09:31.228
Hey!

09:31.971 --> 09:32.960
Well...

09:33.606 --> 09:35.938
Where were we?
- Where were you, Klaus?

09:36.042 --> 09:36.974
Track 11...

09:37.076 --> 09:39.476
That's where the train arrived.
- Track 11. We were there.

09:39.579 --> 09:40.739
Klausi, hi. Klausi...
- Hi, Mama.

09:42.214 --> 09:43.545
We waited for 20 minutes.

09:43.649 --> 09:45.514
I waited for 20 minutes!

09:45.618 --> 09:47.586
What?
- I'm fine.

09:47.687 --> 09:49.279
Let me take it.
- No.

09:50.556 --> 09:51.887
Straight ahead.

09:54.694 --> 09:56.423
Mama, the flower bed!

10:02.134 --> 10:03.965
Mami, can't you watch out!

10:04.070 --> 10:05.401
Hello, we're... oh!

10:06.405 --> 10:07.269
Hi.

10:08.040 --> 10:09.132
Hello, Emma.

10:09.241 --> 10:10.037
Hallo.

10:16.949 --> 10:19.042
Robert, Celine!

10:20.186 --> 10:22.245
How about a kiss?

10:22.355 --> 10:23.982
Robert!

10:24.090 --> 10:26.820
Have a seat. We baked a cake.

10:26.926 --> 10:27.824
Bought one.

10:35.201 --> 10:36.964
Ah!
- Let them.

10:37.970 --> 10:38.902
Thanks.

10:41.674 --> 10:44.336
Gameboy or cake?
- Let them play.

10:45.678 --> 10:48.977
Who'd like coffee?
- No coffee for me. A beer maybe.

10:50.016 --> 10:50.914
Uh...

10:51.017 --> 10:52.575
Then forget it.

10:52.685 --> 10:53.515
Okay.

10:53.619 --> 10:57.350
Forgive the intrusion. Mama had the
sudden urge to visit all of you.

10:57.456 --> 10:58.286
One after the other.

10:58.391 --> 11:00.154
Karl too? That's great!

11:00.259 --> 11:02.056
No, not Karl. Unfortunately.

11:02.161 --> 11:04.026
Why not? That would be so nice.

11:04.130 --> 11:07.258
Maybe next year. After I retire...

11:07.366 --> 11:09.061
You'll have plenty of time.

11:31.257 --> 11:32.224
You okay?

11:33.325 --> 11:34.314
It just went down the wrong way.

11:37.663 --> 11:40.029
Need some water?
- No, I'm fine.

11:42.468 --> 11:44.527
Hey, where have you been?
- Sorry! Hi.

11:46.505 --> 11:48.803
Why did they decide to come,
out of the blue like this?

11:48.908 --> 11:49.237
No idea.

11:49.341 --> 11:51.502
How long are they staying?
- They didn't say.

11:52.211 --> 11:54.179
I have no time.

11:54.280 --> 11:55.838
You think we do?

11:57.717 --> 11:58.684
Hello!

12:02.088 --> 12:03.248
Rudi, not now.

12:03.355 --> 12:04.652
They have to go in the fridge.

12:04.757 --> 12:07.692
Thanks, Pop. I've only been
a vegetarian for six years.

12:07.793 --> 12:09.761
We'll take them. We love them.

12:09.862 --> 12:12.456
But aren't they traditionally
supposed to be eaten before noon?

12:12.565 --> 12:14.328
No, no, they have to
be eaten this evening.

12:14.433 --> 12:18.199
Alright then, we'll have them tonight.

12:19.939 --> 12:21.964
You poor thing, we're taking
your room away from you.

12:22.842 --> 12:24.537
It's okay.

13:01.881 --> 13:03.178
You don't like them, do you?

13:03.282 --> 13:04.271
Not really.

13:05.951 --> 13:07.316
Thanks.

13:07.419 --> 13:09.717
So, more sausage.
- Thanks.

13:11.257 --> 13:13.248
Want to go sightseeing tomorrow?

13:15.261 --> 13:17.661
I'll drive you around a little, okay?

13:17.763 --> 13:18.855
Show you the city.

13:18.964 --> 13:20.022
Oh yes.

13:20.132 --> 13:23.761
And then we'll visit you for coffee.
- Yeah. Great.

13:23.869 --> 13:26.667
Mama wanted to see
some dance performance...

13:26.772 --> 13:28.797
Oh, God, do we all have to go?

13:29.875 --> 13:32.708
A famous Butoh dancer
from Japan is in town.

13:32.812 --> 13:35.747
Butoh, what's that?
- A modern Japanese dance form...

13:35.848 --> 13:37.213
Have another beer?

13:37.316 --> 13:38.248
Bring me one too?

13:38.350 --> 13:40.341
But I don't have to go.
- Sure you do.

13:40.452 --> 13:43.012
Let's do something
we'd all like to do.

13:43.122 --> 13:44.521
We'd love to go with you.

13:57.469 --> 13:59.960
Okay, Mama! Come on.

14:00.806 --> 14:02.273
Please. "The Mayfly".

14:02.374 --> 14:03.534
Go on, Mama.

14:04.810 --> 14:07.608
Mama, Please recite it for us.

14:07.713 --> 14:10.978
Come on, Mama, please!

14:11.083 --> 14:14.519
"Stop! What you're doing is murder

14:14.620 --> 14:15.985
"Such cruelty is not a must

14:16.088 --> 14:18.318
"The mayfly has but one short day

14:18.424 --> 14:19.448
"One single day of pain

14:19.558 --> 14:21.651
One single day of lust."
- "One single day of lust"

14:25.064 --> 14:28.363
"Oh, let it hover there.
Until it meets its end.

14:28.467 --> 14:31.868
Its heaven lasts forever.
Its life one day to make amends."

14:31.971 --> 14:33.199
Right, Mama?

14:35.474 --> 14:36.941
Stop it!

14:42.648 --> 14:45.139
Okay, it's set!
- Look at the birdy.

14:45.251 --> 14:46.980
Come on.
- It's blinking.

14:47.086 --> 14:48.815
Hurry!

14:50.489 --> 14:51.683
Everybody smile.

14:51.790 --> 14:53.781
Say 'ant shit'!

14:54.960 --> 14:58.225
Papa, smile, too!
- I'm smiling already.

14:58.330 --> 15:00.890
That doesn't matter.

15:02.568 --> 15:04.695
Celine, don't you want to...
- She's not part of the family.

15:04.803 --> 15:06.327
Exactly.
- Take the sunglasses off!

15:07.506 --> 15:09.440
Come on! Okay, everybody.

15:09.541 --> 15:10.530
Everybody look in the camera...

15:12.544 --> 15:13.909
And now!

15:14.413 --> 15:15.345
Yeahhh!

15:21.020 --> 15:23.511
You're doing a great job.

15:23.622 --> 15:25.817
A little more.

15:27.359 --> 15:29.122
You're good.

15:33.999 --> 15:35.864
Where'd you learn that?

15:36.235 --> 15:39.204
I don't know. From me.

15:39.305 --> 15:40.829
From you!

15:41.640 --> 15:43.073
But I can't anymore.

15:43.175 --> 15:46.235
Thank you.

15:47.446 --> 15:48.470
It was great.

15:55.421 --> 15:56.319
What a massage.

15:56.422 --> 15:59.357
See, now he feels great.

16:08.701 --> 16:11.295
I forgot to offer your parents some.

16:11.403 --> 16:12.631
Karl always sends them.

16:12.738 --> 16:15.673
I don't touch mine.

16:16.475 --> 16:19.467
I'd rather eat yours.
- How sweet!

16:20.245 --> 16:22.475
They are good! Hmmn?

16:24.817 --> 16:27.615
Oh, it just occurred to me.

16:27.720 --> 16:29.585
I have a meeting all day tomorrow.

16:29.688 --> 16:32.384
You're a pain!
- I don't believe it.

16:32.491 --> 16:33.651
What'll we do with them?

16:33.759 --> 16:36.455
All you politicians do
is sit on your butts!

16:36.562 --> 16:37.688
You told them
you'd show them around!

16:37.796 --> 16:40.822
Sorry, but I just forgot!

16:40.933 --> 16:42.298
I don't have time.

16:42.401 --> 16:45.859
No way. I'm having them
for coffee and cake. That's plenty.

16:45.971 --> 16:47.404
They're staying with us.

16:47.506 --> 16:49.872
They're driving me nuts already.

16:49.975 --> 16:51.237
Hey, they just arrived.

16:51.343 --> 16:55.439
I hate myself for it
but they drive me crazy.

16:56.548 --> 16:58.573
I go whacko in seconds.

16:58.684 --> 17:00.652
Oh, God and I killed a fly.

17:00.753 --> 17:02.687
That was bad.

17:02.788 --> 17:07.781
Yes, I know. Thanks for your support,
dear. It was bad.

17:07.893 --> 17:09.861
Yeah, "The Mayfly".

17:09.962 --> 17:13.489
Right. And the only one of us
they're interested in is Karl.

17:13.598 --> 17:14.361
Hmm?

17:14.465 --> 17:17.731
I just said they're only
interested in Karl anyway.

17:17.836 --> 17:21.294
That's always how it was.
- What I do doesn't interest them at all.

17:21.406 --> 17:23.704
You think they care about what I do?

17:25.477 --> 17:30.005
"Look at Karl! Isn't he cute!

17:30.115 --> 17:35.883
Look at what he made and isn't it
nice the way he play...

17:35.988 --> 17:38.320
Klaus, Leave Karl Alone! Go away!"

17:38.424 --> 17:41.791
No. Remember?
"Karo! Klausi! Let Karli play...

17:41.894 --> 17:44.362
Hi, sweetie!
- Hey.

17:45.964 --> 17:49.900
What's the matter?
- I can't sleep!

17:51.837 --> 17:53.737
I want to be in my room.

17:53.839 --> 17:57.775
Yes, darling, I know.
They're not staying long.

17:57.876 --> 18:00.071
How long?

18:00.179 --> 18:01.476
Forever!

18:05.951 --> 18:07.009
Are you tired?

18:07.119 --> 18:09.747
No, not really.
- Neither am I.

18:10.656 --> 18:12.851
Well...

18:12.958 --> 18:15.825
I'm glad they're all doing well.
- Yes.

18:18.730 --> 18:19.719
Funny.

18:21.166 --> 18:24.294
I can remember them
so well as children

18:25.170 --> 18:29.334
but now I simply
don't know who they are.

18:29.441 --> 18:31.602
Disappointed in them?

18:33.345 --> 18:35.575
I just don't know them anymore.

18:36.715 --> 18:38.444
Well, they're all healthy.

18:39.118 --> 18:40.949
You can't expect too much.

19:22.728 --> 19:24.161
HAPPY AT THE PARK

19:42.247 --> 19:44.238
How long are they staying?
- No idea.

19:46.285 --> 19:48.344
You have to look after them!

19:48.453 --> 19:51.183
How? I don't have the time.

19:51.557 --> 19:54.355
I like your parents.
I wish mine were like yours.

19:54.459 --> 19:56.359
Sure, you don't know them well.

20:00.699 --> 20:03.361
We could get them tickets for
the show in the Friedrichstadtpalast.

20:04.102 --> 20:06.798
My mother hates revues.

20:11.243 --> 20:13.074
She's really gotten old.

20:14.813 --> 20:16.144
Wow.

20:18.050 --> 20:20.018
Yeah, strange how people change.

20:21.987 --> 20:23.887
I wonder what we'll be like.

20:25.691 --> 20:26.919
No idea.

20:28.694 --> 20:30.525
We just won't get old.

20:32.297 --> 20:33.787
What are they doing today?

20:33.899 --> 20:38.302
I can't.

20:38.971 --> 20:42.429
What the hell are we
going to do with them?

20:45.077 --> 20:47.272
No, no, no

20:47.379 --> 20:49.006
Please.

20:49.848 --> 20:54.217
So now you're going to meow or what?

20:54.319 --> 20:55.013
Please...

20:55.120 --> 20:57.281
No. I have to go to the upholsterer.
I don't have time.

20:57.389 --> 20:58.321
I don't either.

20:58.423 --> 21:00.220
No, really, I have too much to do.

21:02.828 --> 21:06.059
No! No.
- Please. Please.

21:09.334 --> 21:11.996
No. No.
- Please.

21:12.104 --> 21:13.696
Please.

21:22.848 --> 21:23.780
So...

21:26.285 --> 21:27.912
Come on. She's here.

21:29.121 --> 21:34.286
So now I'll show you our old apartment.
Karo and I lived up there.

21:34.393 --> 21:40.855
Right over the bar.
Very practical. And a disaster.

21:40.966 --> 21:43.992
But it wasn't renovated then.
We heated with coal.

21:46.204 --> 21:49.230
Oh, man, okay! Alright already!

21:50.375 --> 21:52.434
Sorry! Yeah,
and fuck you, too, asshole!

21:58.850 --> 22:01.785
To your left
the golden dome of the synagogue.

22:01.887 --> 22:06.517
And straight ahead
our beautiful TV tower. Look!

22:37.823 --> 22:41.953
Wow, that must have cost.
What a cake!

22:42.060 --> 22:44.358
We never bought cake at home,
did we, Mama?

22:47.032 --> 22:48.499
Thanks for today, Franzi.

22:48.600 --> 22:51.125
We saw a lot of the city. Thanks.

22:52.371 --> 22:53.702
Thanks!

23:01.613 --> 23:03.843
Did you have a nice time?
- Very nice, yes.

23:04.583 --> 23:07.609
This is good beer.
I hardly ever drink beer anymore.

23:07.719 --> 23:08.913
Thank goodness.

23:11.423 --> 23:13.448
And Karl? Does he still drink?

23:13.558 --> 23:15.219
How should I know?

23:16.895 --> 23:18.590
Karl never drank very much.

23:20.265 --> 23:22.893
Oh, yes he did.
Like a fish for a while.

23:23.001 --> 23:26.698
That's absolutely not true.
- Nonsense!

23:26.805 --> 23:28.864
Does Karli have a girlfriend in Tokyo?

23:29.274 --> 23:31.538
Mama, you call him all the time.
Ask him next time:

23:31.643 --> 23:34.578
"So Karli, how's it going?
Still boozing and what about chicks?"

23:35.514 --> 23:37.505
So, what'll we do now?

23:38.383 --> 23:39.941
What would you like to?

23:45.590 --> 23:47.922
You're both probably tired
and want to go straight to bed.

23:53.365 --> 23:54.798
It's not even six?

23:54.900 --> 23:56.162
We could cook something.

23:57.903 --> 24:00.167
No, Franzi, you've done enough.

24:03.909 --> 24:05.035
Let's go, Rudi.

24:13.685 --> 24:16.313
Want us to drive you home?

24:16.421 --> 24:17.353
No.

24:18.089 --> 24:20.284
Franzi!

24:20.392 --> 24:22.690
Let us take the S-Bahn...

24:22.794 --> 24:28.755
a little big city flair
for us country bumpkins...

24:28.867 --> 24:30.027
Take care.

24:32.337 --> 24:33.736
Come here.

24:37.008 --> 24:37.975
See you tomorrow.

24:38.944 --> 24:40.104
Tomorrow?

24:40.212 --> 24:42.180
We have a date.
- Aha.

24:45.417 --> 24:46.714
Papa!

24:47.619 --> 24:48.847
So long!
- Bye!

24:54.459 --> 24:55.585
Bye, Mama.

25:16.214 --> 25:17.146
Are you coming?

25:18.149 --> 25:19.343
Let's have some wine.

25:19.451 --> 25:21.442
Let's drink something. Come on.

25:24.789 --> 25:27.087
I'm awful...
- No!

25:27.659 --> 25:29.786
Where do we have to go? Herrmannsdorf?

25:29.895 --> 25:31.055
What?

25:31.162 --> 25:33.858
Berlin Center. Where is it?
Has to be in the center somewhere.

25:33.965 --> 25:35.557
Give me some change.

25:35.667 --> 25:36.634
How much?

25:36.735 --> 25:40.068
The train's leaving! You'd know it!

25:40.472 --> 25:41.905
It won't go in.
- Try it again...

25:42.641 --> 25:44.472
It won't take it. How am I
supposed to buy a ticket?

25:44.576 --> 25:45.634
Try this...

25:46.978 --> 25:49.469
It won't go in. It doesn't work.

25:49.581 --> 25:51.674
That's Berlin for you.
- Rudi, I think you need paper money.

25:51.783 --> 25:55.241
They're out of their minds.
A machine and no tickets come out.

25:59.691 --> 26:04.321
Wait... Berlin AB, just what I said.

26:04.429 --> 26:05.225
What now?

26:05.330 --> 26:08.265
We need one more.

26:08.366 --> 26:10.561
So now we have one ticket
for either you or me or what?

26:10.669 --> 26:14.662
Read what it says "Two people
can't use one ticket." Look here!

26:14.773 --> 26:17.936
You can't even pay here.

26:18.043 --> 26:22.104
Am I supposed to walk? Or you?
Or one of us doesn't pay or what?

26:22.213 --> 26:24.113
Rudi, don't get so excited.

26:24.916 --> 26:26.679
I'm not excited. I'm furious.

26:39.731 --> 26:41.130
I think I want to go home.

26:41.933 --> 26:43.298
Oh, Rudi...

26:43.401 --> 26:45.062
The kids don't have any time for us.

26:50.241 --> 26:52.835
The Baltic isn't far.
- Hmm?

26:54.279 --> 26:57.009
When was the last time
we were at the beach?

26:57.115 --> 26:58.275
At the beach?

26:58.383 --> 27:00.248
I can't remember either.

27:00.352 --> 27:03.082
1987? With the kids?

27:03.188 --> 27:04.780
Or was that Lake Garda?

27:06.825 --> 27:08.315
You want to go to the beach?

27:09.194 --> 27:11.321
Yes, would you?

27:11.429 --> 27:15.525
If you want to.
- But what do you want?

27:16.201 --> 27:18.328
I always do whatever you say...

31:38.596 --> 31:40.962
The beach isn't what
it used to be, either.

31:42.767 --> 31:46.168
You old grouch. Aren't you cold?

31:46.271 --> 31:47.431
You know what?

31:47.538 --> 31:48.732
Slip in there.

31:48.840 --> 31:51.673
What?
- It's warm. Go on.

31:51.776 --> 31:55.177
Tomorrow we'll get up early
and take a long walk on the beach.

31:55.280 --> 31:57.475
What? You want to take a walk?

31:57.582 --> 31:59.015
Wonderful!

32:01.219 --> 32:04.211
I'd like my ashes to
be scattered at sea.

32:06.891 --> 32:08.290
What makes you say that?

32:08.393 --> 32:10.827
Nothing. Don't you ever
think about that?

32:11.529 --> 32:14.589
Really? Well, I do every now and then.
How much time we have left...

32:16.734 --> 32:17.598
Rudi...

32:17.702 --> 32:20.466
You're right.
One ought not think about it...

32:21.472 --> 32:22.996
We've been lucky so far.

32:25.209 --> 32:30.146
Assuming we didn't have much time
left, what would you like to do?

32:31.215 --> 32:32.944
Ah, that line: live every day
as if it were your last.

32:33.051 --> 32:34.951
What nonsense.
What else should you do?

32:35.053 --> 32:38.386
Let me tell you: I wouldn't
do anything differently. Nothing.

32:38.489 --> 32:40.923
I'd go to work in the morning
and come home to you in the evening.

32:41.025 --> 32:42.959
That's what I'd do.

32:43.061 --> 32:44.221
Yes.

32:56.641 --> 32:58.108
Can't you sleep?

32:58.209 --> 33:00.336
The surf is so loud.

33:10.254 --> 33:13.189
And now that.
- Come on, Rudi!

33:15.960 --> 33:16.858
It's nice.

33:26.437 --> 33:29.065
You are and always will be loony.

33:30.308 --> 33:31.639
Oh, come on!

33:31.743 --> 33:33.074
What on earth are you doing?

33:33.177 --> 33:34.701
Come on. You can't sleep anyway.

33:34.812 --> 33:36.575
Cut it out!

33:37.648 --> 33:40.515
Dancing in the middle of the night?
Other people are asleep.

34:52.056 --> 34:55.184
What's with you?
- Nothing. Nothing at all.

35:30.061 --> 35:32.052
What's wrong? Have you had enough?

35:32.163 --> 35:33.687
Didn't you sleep well?

35:35.066 --> 35:37.762
I didn't but you did.
- Me? Not one second.

35:37.869 --> 35:39.928
You slept like a log.

35:43.341 --> 35:45.070
Let's go home.

35:45.176 --> 35:46.939
We've seen Berlin,
we've seen the Baltic,

35:47.044 --> 35:48.978
and we've seen the children.
Let's go home.

35:50.214 --> 35:52.808
I thought you'd be glad to
see your children.

35:54.285 --> 35:56.276
I don't know them. They don't know me.

35:58.689 --> 36:01.089
Our children are better than most.

36:01.192 --> 36:02.955
Yes, we're fortunate.

36:03.995 --> 36:06.225
We have each other.
That's real happiness.

36:18.476 --> 36:19.408
What is it?

36:20.711 --> 36:21.507
Nothing.

36:22.547 --> 36:23.980
I just didn't get
a good night's sleep.

36:24.081 --> 36:26.345
Whenever I woke up
you were sound asleep.

37:41.492 --> 37:45.394
How calm the sea is.

37:47.031 --> 37:49.329
As if was always that way.

37:49.433 --> 37:51.594
It's time to rise and shine!
Come on! Get up you lazybones!

37:53.638 --> 37:55.367
Trudi...

38:00.177 --> 38:02.372
Trudi...

38:35.413 --> 38:37.779
Papa, Karl's here.

38:39.917 --> 38:42.351
The sea is so calm.

38:52.663 --> 38:53.459
Come on.

39:48.386 --> 39:50.752
I can't stand her lying
in that box in there.

39:50.855 --> 39:55.224
I haven't seen her for so long
and now I'll never see her again.

39:56.494 --> 40:00.658
I should've visited her.
Or at least flown her to Tokyo.

40:00.765 --> 40:03.165
I never did anything for her.

40:04.368 --> 40:06.097
And now there's nothing I can do.

40:08.639 --> 40:10.539
We have to look after Papa now.

40:11.108 --> 40:13.702
And how am I supposed to do that?
- I understand.

41:15.139 --> 41:16.629
We never went to the beach
when we were kids.

41:16.740 --> 41:17.968
No, always to the mountains, right?

41:18.075 --> 41:19.269
We were in Italy once.

41:19.376 --> 41:20.866
But not at the beach.
- Lake Garda.

41:21.612 --> 41:22.874
Grosglockner. We took the Grosglockner
pass over the Alps, right, Papa?

41:22.980 --> 41:24.607
Yeah. We all got carsick

41:24.715 --> 41:27.240
but Mama had a plastic bag
for each of us.

41:27.351 --> 41:29.216
She was so full of life back then.

41:31.489 --> 41:32.649
How old was she?

41:32.756 --> 41:34.587
A little older than we are now.

41:34.692 --> 41:38.287
She devoted almost her
entire life to you kids and me.

41:39.096 --> 41:40.859
She wouldn't have put it that way.

41:43.267 --> 41:44.734
Want me to go with you?

41:46.470 --> 41:50.770
It's just not right. It's not fair.
She can't just leave him alone with us.

41:50.875 --> 41:52.934
I don't think she planned it like that.
- Yes, I know.

41:53.043 --> 41:55.238
Mama would've been able to
get along... No problem there.

41:55.346 --> 41:58.509
But him? What are we
supposed to do with him?

42:00.651 --> 42:02.278
When are you flying back?

42:02.386 --> 42:05.048
I can't stay long. My flight leaves
tomorrow afternoon from Berlin.

42:05.155 --> 42:06.383
We have to get back, too.

42:06.490 --> 42:08.185
So do we.
The kids are at the neighbors.

42:08.292 --> 42:09.520
Who has the bag?

42:09.627 --> 42:10.457
What bag?

42:10.561 --> 42:12.461
The bag with her things. I'd like to
have the kimono if you all don't mind.

42:12.563 --> 42:13.461
She always used to
have it on in the kitchen. No.

42:13.564 --> 42:14.428
Yes.

42:15.065 --> 42:17.260
It's all over. And it's impossible
to even imagine beforehand.

42:31.315 --> 42:34.079
If I had known
it would end so suddenly,

42:37.021 --> 42:40.457
I would have been nicer to her.

42:41.926 --> 42:45.521
Papa, nobody can know that.

42:47.231 --> 42:49.222
Thanks for us to be able to
sit here like this.

42:49.333 --> 42:51.927
She would have been
very happy you came, Karl.

42:54.338 --> 42:56.033
What are you going to do now?

42:58.142 --> 43:00.076
I'll have to get used to it.

43:00.177 --> 43:01.872
Don't worry about me.

43:07.217 --> 43:08.206
Thanks.

43:10.154 --> 43:11.621
Emma, give me a little more wine.

43:12.456 --> 43:13.889
Excuse me.

45:32.930 --> 45:35.558
My condolences.
- Thank you.

45:35.666 --> 45:37.634
And this must be Karolin.

45:37.735 --> 45:42.001
No, no, Karolin is in Berlin.
And our youngest is in Japan.

45:42.106 --> 45:43.971
Ah, yes. And Klaus? Where is Klaus?

45:44.675 --> 45:46.905
He has a very important meeting.
- I see.

45:47.478 --> 45:49.503
My condolences.

45:49.613 --> 45:53.242
My condolences. My condolences.

45:53.884 --> 45:57.547
The dance performance was
what she enjoyed most in Berlin.

45:57.654 --> 45:59.554
She said she'd never met
a nicer girl than you.

45:59.656 --> 46:03.092
I'm not that nice. I don't know
why she thought that of me.

46:03.193 --> 46:05.753
She told me about how
she always wanted to dance,

46:06.964 --> 46:10.092
to become a really good Butoh dancer,
more than anything else in her life...

46:10.200 --> 46:14.000
and how she would've liked to
go to Japan so much to study it there

46:14.104 --> 46:18.336
and how everything
turned out differently

46:18.842 --> 46:21.276
and that it was a good life but...
Not that you think that she wasn't happy.

46:21.378 --> 46:25.246
No... I thought...
maybe there's another woman in her...

46:25.349 --> 46:28.375
that nobody saw...

46:28.485 --> 46:31.215
and I saw that other person...
that's all...

46:58.182 --> 46:59.149
That's her?

47:01.218 --> 47:06.588
I didn't like it.
It was so... so extreme.

47:06.690 --> 47:10.751
It embarrassed me...
I didn't want her to keep it up...

47:12.162 --> 47:14.357
We locked her up in here.

47:15.165 --> 47:17.099
But she was happy here.

47:17.801 --> 47:18.790
For sure.

47:20.337 --> 47:21.531
I don't know.

47:26.443 --> 47:27.341
Goodbye.

47:39.223 --> 47:41.020
All the best.
- Thanks.

47:41.692 --> 47:43.216
Have a good trip!
- Okay!

48:34.645 --> 48:37.637
One hundred Views of Mt. Fuji.

49:10.013 --> 49:12.811
Trudi, where are you?

49:15.052 --> 49:16.519
Where?

49:59.496 --> 50:00.861
Papa.
- Ah!

50:00.964 --> 50:03.296
I thought you'd forgotten me. Hi.

50:03.400 --> 50:06.164
I couldn't get away earlier.

50:06.269 --> 50:08.362
How are you? Was the flight okay?
- Fine.

50:33.263 --> 50:34.321
Papa, come on.

51:02.659 --> 51:04.354
You have to take your shoes off.

51:05.162 --> 51:08.359
Oh, yes.

51:11.168 --> 51:12.066
Wait...

51:18.875 --> 51:19.569
There.

51:19.676 --> 51:21.576
I brought my own.
- Okay.

51:36.526 --> 51:37.993
It's not exactly big.

51:38.829 --> 51:39.853
No.

51:48.405 --> 51:49.497
Want something to drink?

52:02.352 --> 52:04.445
Mama always sent you this.

52:04.554 --> 52:08.615
You can't get bread like this
in Japan and the sausages.

52:08.725 --> 52:14.220
And these, two flavors.

52:14.331 --> 52:15.593
Papa, I have to get back to the office.

52:15.699 --> 52:17.860
What exactly do you do?

52:17.968 --> 52:19.902
I've never quite understood...

52:20.003 --> 52:23.996
Nice of you to ask after five years.
I crunch numbers.

52:24.107 --> 52:25.836
What you do with garbage fees.
I do pretty much the same thing as you.

52:32.382 --> 52:36.910
Look... Radio, air conditioner,
satellite receiver, TV.

52:37.721 --> 52:39.154
See you this evening, okay?

52:40.991 --> 52:42.583
I'll be back around six.

53:38.014 --> 53:41.472
My dear Karl,
here's the second stanza:

53:41.585 --> 53:46.284
Oh, let it hover there
until it meets its end

53:46.389 --> 53:52.624
Its heaven lasts forever
It's life one day to make amends

54:51.821 --> 54:54.517
Want something else?
- No, it's fine.

54:55.992 --> 54:58.859
We'll think something out for you
tomorrow. I have to go out later tonight.

55:01.197 --> 55:01.754
Okay.

55:01.865 --> 55:06.700
I'm sorry that I have such little time
but I didn't have much warning.

55:06.803 --> 55:10.170
I don't want to get on your nerves.
- Come on, don't even say that.

55:15.378 --> 55:18.279
Why didn't the two of you
ever visit me?

55:23.586 --> 55:25.577
We thought we had time.

55:28.091 --> 55:34.428
I think I kept your mother from
what was most important to her.

55:37.067 --> 55:38.967
You can't do things for the dead.

55:39.836 --> 55:41.394
Papa...

57:01.017 --> 57:04.578
Look, here's some yen.
I'll pick you up later.

57:04.687 --> 57:07.588
Don't move from here.
I don't want you to get lost. Look,

57:08.591 --> 57:10.718
I work over there.
- Which building?

57:10.827 --> 57:13.261
Next to the black one.
So, I'll pick you up later. Bye.

57:29.312 --> 57:31.712
Uh... beer.

57:49.065 --> 57:49.793
Thank you.

58:24.567 --> 58:26.501
Ahungu what?

01:00:45.608 --> 01:00:48.600
Nein, I'm, I'm not understand.

01:00:53.282 --> 01:00:54.772
Oh, no, es ist, it's good, it's good.

01:02:07.490 --> 01:02:10.288
Hey! Where were you? Are you crazy?

01:02:10.393 --> 01:02:13.794
I was so worried.
I thought I'd lost you for good.

01:02:13.896 --> 01:02:15.625
Unbelievable!

01:02:15.732 --> 01:02:18.257
The doorbells, I couldn't read them.

01:02:18.367 --> 01:02:19.732
Who told you to go anywhere?

01:02:19.836 --> 01:02:21.201
You can't read anything here.

01:02:21.304 --> 01:02:22.532
I told you to stay put.
- I don't understand anything.

01:02:22.638 --> 01:02:23.229
I told you to stay where you were.

01:02:23.339 --> 01:02:25.170
Do you have any idea
how big this city is?

01:02:25.742 --> 01:02:27.300
How easy it is to get lost?

01:04:50.623 --> 01:04:52.682
Hi, Papa.
- Hello.

01:04:53.726 --> 01:04:56.422
How was your day?
- So so.

01:05:00.533 --> 01:05:02.296
Didn't you go out?
- No.

01:05:08.941 --> 01:05:10.431
Know how my cell works?

01:05:12.612 --> 01:05:13.544
Look,

01:05:15.381 --> 01:05:17.815
here. Just one button.

01:05:17.917 --> 01:05:20.750
I saw it. It has a picture of you.
- Right.

01:05:20.853 --> 01:05:22.411
Look, that's my phone number.

01:05:26.058 --> 01:05:27.923
Did you eat anything?
- Yes.

01:05:29.762 --> 01:05:31.161
No, you didn't.

01:05:34.433 --> 01:05:36.264
I don't understand where Trudi is.

01:05:37.670 --> 01:05:39.297
Where her body is.

01:05:42.508 --> 01:05:44.874
My memories of her are in my body,

01:05:44.977 --> 01:05:47.104
but when my body's no longer here,
where will Trudi be then?

01:05:47.213 --> 01:05:52.241
Papa... Papa,
I'm grieving for Mama, too...

01:05:52.351 --> 01:05:54.148
but... really...

01:05:54.253 --> 01:05:58.656
Don't tell me life goes on. Please.

01:06:13.172 --> 01:06:14.366
Come on, now!

01:06:17.843 --> 01:06:20.311
You know, this is Bavarian Style.

01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:22.872
This is Bavarian Style.

01:06:31.590 --> 01:06:36.493
Cherry blossoms... The most beautiful
symbol for impermanence...

01:06:36.595 --> 01:06:39.530
They're only here for a few days.

01:06:39.632 --> 01:06:41.600
And then they're gone.

01:06:41.701 --> 01:06:43.896
That's it.

01:06:58.317 --> 01:07:00.808
Papa, that's my Papa!

01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:02.217
Nice, huh, Papa!

01:07:04.490 --> 01:07:09.018
Kampai, kampai, kampai!

01:07:21.307 --> 01:07:23.434
Don't treat me like a child!

01:07:23.542 --> 01:07:25.373
It's bedtime.

01:07:26.645 --> 01:07:30.206
This will be the first time
you've ever put me to bed.

01:07:30.316 --> 01:07:32.375
You of all people! Hilarious!

01:07:32.485 --> 01:07:34.976
How can anyone get so loaded?

01:07:35.087 --> 01:07:37.317
Everyone always has to look after you.
- Come on now.

01:07:37.423 --> 01:07:40.654
You always have to be
the center of attention.

01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:42.091
Give me your arm!

01:07:42.194 --> 01:07:43.957
Be considerate of your father!
Your poor father!

01:07:44.063 --> 01:07:46.224
Leave your father alone! He's tired!

01:07:46.332 --> 01:07:51.702
He works so hard!
Works his ass off in the office!

01:07:51.804 --> 01:07:52.668
So, that's enough.

01:07:52.772 --> 01:07:54.501
You spent your entire life
hiding in your office!

01:07:54.607 --> 01:07:56.336
You never even really knew Mama!

01:07:56.442 --> 01:07:59.878
You have no idea who she was!

01:07:59.979 --> 01:08:03.415
No idea, you old fool, you.

01:08:04.950 --> 01:08:05.939
Get out!

01:08:06.051 --> 01:08:09.418
Go back to your garbage trucks,
that's where you belong.

01:08:09.522 --> 01:08:11.319
And don't forget to recycle!

01:08:13.259 --> 01:08:16.716
"An Apple a day, keeps a doctor away."

01:08:28.274 --> 01:08:29.263
So... So.

01:08:36.015 --> 01:08:37.175
So, I have to go.

01:08:38.082 --> 01:08:40.142
Wait... Here.

01:08:53.131 --> 01:08:54.224
Oh, Papa.

01:08:56.402 --> 01:08:59.667
Stop. Your apple.

01:08:59.772 --> 01:09:02.536
"An apple a day, keeps the doctor away."
...keeps the doctor away.

01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:03.630
Bye.

01:09:04.210 --> 01:09:05.142
So long.

01:09:07.813 --> 01:09:09.609
What is this?

01:09:10.950 --> 01:09:12.383
Metal.

01:09:12.484 --> 01:09:18.720
Plastic. Plastic. Metal. Metal.

01:09:18.823 --> 01:09:21.224
Paper. Paper.
