00:18.618 --> 00:19.585
So you finally found the bollocks.

00:19.587 --> 00:22.321
To come out in the open.

00:22.323 --> 00:24.056
I don't hide.

00:24.058 --> 00:25.758
Is that what you tell yourself now?

00:25.760 --> 00:28.260
It's the truth.

00:28.262 --> 00:29.328
Well, look around you, brother.

00:29.330 --> 00:32.064
It's not exactly dublin.

00:32.066 --> 00:33.665
This is where my job is.

00:36.103 --> 00:37.503
You laugh again,

00:37.505 --> 00:40.139
I'll knock the teeth out of your head.

00:40.141 --> 00:42.141
Well, careful, now.

00:42.143 --> 00:44.076
I'm not exactly 10 years old anymore.

00:44.078 --> 00:47.813
You're no smarter
than you were back then.

00:47.815 --> 00:49.448
Alex Vaughn?

00:49.450 --> 00:50.449
You're running around

00:50.451 --> 00:53.552
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:53.554 --> 00:55.054
I saw you on the roof of that bank.

00:55.056 --> 00:56.488
I was home with the wife
and kids that day.

00:56.490 --> 00:58.057
I didn't say what day.

00:58.059 --> 00:59.259
Pick one.

01:02.362 --> 01:03.729
Does da know you're with this tosser?

01:03.731 --> 01:05.798
Da?

01:07.400 --> 01:10.536
You talk to me about da?

01:10.538 --> 01:12.504
Which do you think
would bother him more?

01:12.506 --> 01:13.772
Me running with Alex Vaughn.

01:13.774 --> 01:15.240
Or standing here talking to you?

01:15.242 --> 01:16.375
Vaughn is bad people.

01:16.377 --> 01:17.709
He never turned grass.

01:17.711 --> 01:19.511
I'm no grass.

01:19.513 --> 01:20.713
You're on the other side.

01:20.714 --> 01:23.082
I never informed on the family.

01:23.084 --> 01:24.083
Never.

01:24.085 --> 01:25.250
I'm trying to help you.

01:25.252 --> 01:26.251
Why do you even care?

01:26.253 --> 01:27.519
You're still my brother.

01:27.521 --> 01:30.122
I thought you didn't want me to laugh.

01:32.492 --> 01:34.226
Colin...

01:34.228 --> 01:37.129
Now, you listen close.

01:38.298 --> 01:40.566
The next time I see you
at a crime scene,

01:40.568 --> 01:42.267
I won't let you walk away.

01:42.269 --> 01:44.103
You let me?

01:44.105 --> 01:45.604
I had you in my sights
five or six times,

01:45.606 --> 01:46.806
and you know I never miss.

01:46.807 --> 01:48.540
Then why didn't you take the shot?

01:48.542 --> 01:50.143
Because you wouldn't know it was me.

01:51.578 --> 01:54.313
When I kill you, I want you to know.

01:56.216 --> 01:58.884
Always a treat, big brother.

02:10.865 --> 02:12.164
Open it.

02:16.770 --> 02:19.671
You know who owns this building?

02:30.517 --> 02:32.718
Paolo, no one was supposed to get hurt.

02:32.720 --> 02:34.520
It's not like I killed him.

02:34.522 --> 02:36.455
He's gonna have a headache.

02:36.457 --> 02:37.723
Come on.

02:39.293 --> 02:41.493
Wow.

02:42.463 --> 02:43.462
My God.

02:43.464 --> 02:44.664
This is amazing.

02:53.406 --> 02:54.806
We have to go.

02:55.909 --> 02:57.176
Run!

03:00.213 --> 03:01.413
Run! Run!

03:07.387 --> 03:08.387
Here!

03:08.389 --> 03:10.622
This way! This way! Come on!

03:16.430 --> 03:18.430
Move! <i>Idioti</i>!

03:18.432 --> 03:21.466
I'm very sorry. You must come with us.

03:21.468 --> 03:22.534
What?

03:22.536 --> 03:23.602
Just drive the car!

03:23.604 --> 03:25.537
Go, go, go, go!

03:25.539 --> 03:27.940
Where the hell are you taking me?

03:29.642 --> 03:30.742
You idiot!

03:30.744 --> 03:32.544
You want to tell Mr. Conti.

03:32.546 --> 03:34.379
That you not only let him get robbed,

03:34.381 --> 03:35.714
you killed his daughter?

03:35.716 --> 03:39.251
Let them? They attacked me!

03:41.721 --> 03:43.622
Poor man.

03:46.359 --> 03:47.659
Get the cars.

03:51.631 --> 03:54.533
Giancarlo speaking.

03:54.535 --> 03:57.636
There's been trouble at the warehouse.

04:29.569 --> 04:33.905
Pull over! Pull over!

04:33.907 --> 04:36.475
Can you go grab us some food?

04:36.477 --> 04:38.644
Don't do anything stupid.

04:42.548 --> 04:43.949
Hey!

04:52.492 --> 04:53.458
Go.

04:53.460 --> 04:54.660
What?

04:54.662 --> 04:55.694
Go. You're free.

04:55.696 --> 04:56.528
No.

04:56.530 --> 04:57.462
What do you mean, no?

04:57.464 --> 04:59.831
This is my car. You go.

04:59.833 --> 05:01.700
I'm the one with the gun.

05:01.702 --> 05:03.835
Well, I'm not giving you my car.

05:14.480 --> 05:16.081
<i>We tracked her cell phone to manzano.</i>

05:16.083 --> 05:19.318
<i>Yes, don't worry, Mr. Conti.</i>

05:22.789 --> 05:24.389
There he is!

05:27.727 --> 05:29.728
Run! Run! They're coming!

05:29.730 --> 05:30.529
Start the car! Start the car!

05:30.531 --> 05:31.963
We need to go!

05:31.965 --> 05:32.831
Go!

05:32.833 --> 05:35.033
Go! Go, go, go!

05:35.035 --> 05:36.601
Come on! Come on!

05:36.603 --> 05:37.936
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

05:43.609 --> 05:45.677
No witnesses. Come on.

05:57.724 --> 05:58.957
Hey, it's okay, paolo. It's okay.

05:58.959 --> 06:00.826
It's not okay, Antonio. It's not okay.

06:00.828 --> 06:03.028
They shot innocent people.

06:03.030 --> 06:04.029
They murdered them...

06:04.031 --> 06:07.032
Hey, you said they shot people?

06:07.034 --> 06:08.967
Yeah, in the market.

06:08.969 --> 06:10.569
They didn't care who they hit.

06:10.571 --> 06:12.504
My father's security.

06:12.506 --> 06:14.673
Would never act like that.

06:14.675 --> 06:15.875
"Your?"

06:17.910 --> 06:19.678
Nicola Conti is your father?

06:19.680 --> 06:20.912
Yeah.

06:20.914 --> 06:22.781
That's why they stop shooting at us.

06:22.783 --> 06:23.715
Every time we get near her.

06:23.717 --> 06:25.050
I don't understand.

06:25.052 --> 06:27.719
Why giancarlo just didn't
take you into custody.

06:27.721 --> 06:29.054
Custody? Who do you think they are?

06:29.056 --> 06:30.922
I know who they are!

06:30.924 --> 06:32.624
My father
is a very important businessman,

06:32.626 --> 06:34.860
and those men are his security!

06:34.862 --> 06:38.063
Has a warehouse full of this?

06:38.065 --> 06:40.665
What did you think we were stealing?

06:40.667 --> 06:42.167
Paolo, we have to go. Come on.

06:43.970 --> 06:45.837
I'm sorry, but you're coming with us.

07:15.601 --> 07:17.869
Okay, I have two bags.

07:17.871 --> 07:19.638
I'll have to carry them.

07:19.640 --> 07:20.906
One at a time.

07:24.844 --> 07:26.912
Hey, um... I thought you were the taxi.

07:26.914 --> 07:28.814
So I gather.

07:28.816 --> 07:30.949
I'm in a hurry.

07:32.919 --> 07:35.854
You gonna pretend we have
nothing to talk about?

07:37.958 --> 07:41.526
For surviving
a life or death situation.

07:41.528 --> 07:45.030
I don't blame you
for telling them that I'm a cop.

07:45.032 --> 07:46.865
I sure wasn't going to have them.

07:46.867 --> 07:47.999
Hurt anyone else.

07:48.001 --> 07:49.000
Was it about the needle?

07:49.002 --> 07:50.068
No, but...

07:50.070 --> 07:52.037
I didn't want to talk about that,

07:52.039 --> 07:53.595
but your boss was pretty insistent.

07:54.941 --> 07:55.941
My boss?

07:55.943 --> 07:59.644
The robbers were the first to tell,

07:59.646 --> 08:01.079
but he wanted me to corroborate it.

08:01.081 --> 08:02.080
In writing.

08:02.082 --> 08:03.882
It's not about that either.

08:03.884 --> 08:05.884
Well, I don't have time
for guessing games.

08:05.886 --> 08:06.985
Yeah, have you got time
for 100,000 euro?

08:06.987 --> 08:07.919
I'm sorry?

08:07.921 --> 08:08.954
That's what you reported.

08:08.956 --> 08:11.857
100,000 missing from the vault.

08:11.859 --> 08:13.158
Yeah, one of the robbers got away.

08:13.160 --> 08:14.960
Yeah, the Irish kid, the tiger.

08:14.962 --> 08:16.162
Yeah, newly rich Irish kid.

08:16.163 --> 08:20.198
But it's a nice number for a new start.

08:21.667 --> 08:23.201
I came to the bank that morning.

08:23.203 --> 08:27.105
About an account
that belonged to a carnival,

08:27.107 --> 08:29.975
and you seemed to know
what I was talking about.

08:33.111 --> 08:34.011
What do you want?

08:34.014 --> 08:36.914
That you don't need
anyone paying attention.

08:36.917 --> 08:41.019
To how you're financing your new start.

08:41.020 --> 08:41.986
Paying attention?

08:41.989 --> 08:43.054
I work with a bunch of people,

08:43.056 --> 08:46.124
they will track you
anywhere in the world.

08:46.126 --> 08:48.093
They're good. They're really good.

08:48.095 --> 08:50.128
And the moment you spend
a penny more than you should,

08:50.130 --> 08:53.098
guess what? I'll be there.

08:54.267 --> 08:56.001
Or?

08:56.003 --> 08:58.036
Or I'll ignore you
for the rest of our lives.

08:58.038 --> 08:59.070
Forget we ever met.

08:59.072 --> 09:01.139
If?

09:06.979 --> 09:08.179
If you close that account.

09:10.283 --> 09:12.183
That's my number.

09:12.185 --> 09:13.919
Anika, call me when it's done.

09:30.870 --> 09:34.806
Hold the gun. I'll be right back.

09:34.808 --> 09:35.807
And I need to go.

09:35.809 --> 09:37.108
What?

09:37.110 --> 09:39.611
Unless you want me to pee right here.

09:39.613 --> 09:40.946
Just give me the key.

09:40.948 --> 09:42.847
Excuse me, I'm not stupid.
You'd leave me.

09:42.849 --> 09:44.015
Who's the hostage?

09:44.017 --> 09:45.917
I'm not giving you my car.

10:39.238 --> 10:40.438
Hi.

10:44.844 --> 10:46.044
Thank you for coming.

10:51.417 --> 10:52.784
I've been walking.

10:52.786 --> 10:54.386
All night?

10:54.388 --> 10:56.855
It didn't seem so
until the sun came up.

10:56.857 --> 10:58.823
Louis has been calling you.

10:58.825 --> 11:00.825
That's why I threw my phone away.

11:00.827 --> 11:02.727
You threw it away?

11:02.729 --> 11:04.896
In the river.

11:04.898 --> 11:06.131
From a bridge.

11:07.733 --> 11:10.135
Well, he is very worried about you.

11:11.737 --> 11:12.771
I want to apologize.

11:12.773 --> 11:14.406
I was cruel to you.

11:14.408 --> 11:16.808
Yesterday on the train.

11:16.810 --> 11:17.676
You did not deserve that.

11:17.678 --> 11:21.813
Cruelty and honesty...

11:22.882 --> 11:24.949
It's very hard to separate
the two of them sometimes.

11:24.951 --> 11:28.820
I know what I intended,
and that was to hurt you.

11:30.356 --> 11:31.823
And I'm sorry.

11:33.826 --> 11:35.860
"In order to move others deeply,."

11:35.862 --> 11:39.764
We must deliberately allow ourselves.

11:39.766 --> 11:41.099
To be carried away.

11:41.101 --> 11:45.601
"Beyond the bounds
of our normal sensibilities."

11:46.972 --> 11:48.172
Joseph Conrad.

11:49.008 --> 11:50.775
The immortal.

11:50.777 --> 11:51.743
What if cruelty becomes.

11:51.745 --> 11:53.978
My normal sensibility?

11:53.980 --> 11:58.480
This has been a very difficult
time for all of us,

11:58.485 --> 12:00.885
but we will persevere.

12:00.887 --> 12:02.253
It is who we are, Rebecca.

12:03.756 --> 12:05.090
Did you tell Louis I was here?

12:06.726 --> 12:08.793
No. You asked me not to.

12:10.496 --> 12:11.730
Will you call him?

12:11.732 --> 12:12.764
Yes, of course I will.

12:12.766 --> 12:14.766
Shall I tell him you're here?

12:14.768 --> 12:16.935
Yeah. Please.

12:16.937 --> 12:19.003
I need to work things out.

12:22.007 --> 12:25.176
You're looking for me?

12:25.178 --> 12:26.444
Yeah.

12:26.446 --> 12:29.047
Did you talk to Anne-Marie
this morning?

12:29.049 --> 12:30.048
No.

12:30.050 --> 12:34.550
I got a call about an open case
<i>that I left at my old unit,</i>

12:37.958 --> 12:40.058
<i>a group of trafficked women</i>
<i>coming to the South of calais.</i>

12:40.060 --> 12:42.127
<i>I'm going to help</i>
<i>my former team make the arrest.</i>

12:42.129 --> 12:43.228
<i>So I can close the case.</i>

12:43.230 --> 12:44.529
<i>I'll let you know when I'm back,</i>

12:44.531 --> 12:47.232
<i>and I have my icc cell</i>
<i>if you need me. Bye.</i>

12:49.535 --> 12:52.270
She never checked back in,
and I can't reach her.

12:52.272 --> 12:54.172
Do you know if she ever
made the arrest?

12:54.174 --> 12:57.542
If there is any record
of the arrest in the system?

12:57.544 --> 12:59.144
Sure.

12:59.146 --> 13:01.179
Thank you.

13:01.181 --> 13:04.849
You asked me about my needle
after the bank robbery.

13:06.519 --> 13:08.186
Who told you about that?

13:08.188 --> 13:11.356
The robber, Vaughn.

13:11.358 --> 13:12.390
He told the local chief,

13:12.392 --> 13:14.159
and the local chief told me.

13:14.161 --> 13:15.560
Did you talk to anybody else?

13:17.229 --> 13:19.030
Yeah.

13:19.032 --> 13:20.431
The bank manager.

13:20.433 --> 13:22.100
She confirmed it,

13:22.102 --> 13:24.135
in writing.

13:25.504 --> 13:26.337
You want to see?

13:26.339 --> 13:30.141
No thanks. I was there.

13:34.547 --> 13:35.580
Dorn?

13:35.582 --> 13:37.248
Hey.

13:37.250 --> 13:39.184
Switch on the TV.

13:39.186 --> 13:40.653
There's something you should see.

13:41.520 --> 13:45.123
<i>20 dead in a mass shooting</i>
<i>in manzano, Italy,</i>

13:45.125 --> 13:48.092
<i>including the alleged shooter,</i>
<i>this man.</i>

13:48.094 --> 13:51.162
<i>Preliminary reports identify him.</i>

13:51.164 --> 13:53.832
<i>As a local farmer who</i>
<i>committed suicide at the scene.</i>

13:53.834 --> 13:55.166
That's horrible.

13:55.168 --> 13:57.101
No, it's more than horrible.

13:57.103 --> 13:58.436
What do you mean?

13:58.438 --> 14:00.138
I mean that this guy is not a farmer.

14:00.140 --> 14:01.339
He's a member of
an organized crime group.

14:01.341 --> 14:02.340
Called 'ndrangheta.

14:02.342 --> 14:04.342
It's a kind of mafia.

14:04.344 --> 14:06.411
I arrested him before.

14:06.413 --> 14:09.280
His name is gino fruscetti.

14:10.282 --> 14:12.283
Carl, I need to go somewhere.

14:12.285 --> 14:14.152
Can you take charge here?

14:14.154 --> 14:15.186
Okay?

14:15.188 --> 14:16.120
Yeah, you got it.

14:16.122 --> 14:17.856
Thank you.

14:19.258 --> 14:21.125
The locals think I'm wrong.

14:21.127 --> 14:23.194
They have a witness
who says he knew him.

14:23.196 --> 14:25.530
And confirms he was both
the farmer and the shooter.

14:25.532 --> 14:26.497
Could you be mistaken?

14:26.499 --> 14:29.167
I not only arrested him,
I know who he works for.

14:29.169 --> 14:31.202
Did you guys see the mass shooting?

14:31.204 --> 14:33.571
Yeah, we were just talking about it.

14:33.573 --> 14:36.207
The guy they say is the shooter
is someone I arrested in Italy.

14:36.209 --> 14:38.209
They caught the shooter already?

14:38.211 --> 14:41.279
Local? Didn't even know they had farms.

14:41.281 --> 14:43.915
It's not in Slovenia. It's in Italy.

14:43.917 --> 14:45.917
No, it's Slovenia.

14:45.919 --> 14:48.486
Hey, you're both right.

14:48.488 --> 14:50.521
There's a second mass shooting.

14:50.523 --> 14:52.257
At a petrol station
near brda, Slovenia.

14:52.259 --> 14:54.292
At least nine dead there.

14:54.294 --> 14:55.393
Two mass shootings?

14:55.395 --> 14:57.128
They're not even an hour apart.

14:57.130 --> 15:00.064
Can't be a coincidence.

15:12.344 --> 15:15.613
And you're sure that this guy
they say is the shooter,

15:15.615 --> 15:17.081
he's not a farmer but some mafia guy?

15:17.083 --> 15:19.984
Yeah. He works for an 'ndrangheta boss.

15:19.986 --> 15:21.386
Called Nicola Conti.

15:21.388 --> 15:23.588
He's based right in that area.

15:23.590 --> 15:25.390
I know him very well.

15:25.392 --> 15:26.958
Then we've got this second
shooting scene an hour away.

15:26.960 --> 15:28.626
Same type of weapons.

15:28.628 --> 15:30.094
It's a mass murder spree still moving.

15:30.096 --> 15:31.329
If this ain't something for us,

15:31.331 --> 15:32.531
then what the hell is?

15:34.099 --> 15:35.667
Sebastian, Tommy, go to
the latest scene in Slovenia.

15:35.669 --> 15:39.437
Are going to go talk
to this mafia guy, Conti.

15:39.439 --> 15:41.706
I'll let Louis know what's going on.

15:46.679 --> 15:49.180
You're so beautiful.

15:49.182 --> 15:51.349
I'm sorry I worried you.

15:54.053 --> 15:55.053
It's fine.

15:55.055 --> 15:56.554
No, it's not fine.

15:56.556 --> 15:57.555
I was angry.

15:57.557 --> 15:59.991
You are angry about the bugs?

15:59.993 --> 16:03.061
About you sending Michel
to handle telling me.

16:03.063 --> 16:04.629
That was not my intention.

16:04.631 --> 16:05.964
Hickman was trapped...

16:05.966 --> 16:10.168
It may have been perfectly
legitimate, Louis,

16:10.170 --> 16:11.336
but it took precedence.

16:11.338 --> 16:13.671
Over us. Over me.

16:13.673 --> 16:15.640
Again.

16:19.212 --> 16:21.179
I'm sorry, excuse me.

16:24.616 --> 16:26.117
We need to use the bugs.

16:26.119 --> 16:28.119
To get disinformation to the Russians.

16:28.121 --> 16:30.254
Dorn told you that?

16:30.256 --> 16:32.991
I didn't need to be told, Louis.

16:32.993 --> 16:33.992
I was a prosecutor,

16:33.994 --> 16:35.994
remember?

16:35.996 --> 16:37.128
When will we do it?

16:37.130 --> 16:38.096
I will ask dorn to...

16:38.098 --> 16:39.163
Soon.

16:39.165 --> 16:40.498
I need this to be over.

16:40.500 --> 16:41.499
So do I.

16:41.501 --> 16:43.301
Not in the way I do.

16:43.303 --> 16:44.602
What do you mean?

16:44.604 --> 16:47.271
I'm stuck.

16:47.273 --> 16:49.240
Like a car in mud.

16:49.242 --> 16:52.610
I can't...

16:52.612 --> 16:53.678
I can't move forward,

16:53.680 --> 16:57.081
I can't move backward,

16:57.083 --> 16:59.317
and I'm sinking,

16:59.319 --> 17:00.519
deeper every day.

17:00.520 --> 17:02.053
Maybe...

17:02.055 --> 17:02.787
No, listen.

17:02.789 --> 17:05.189
You have your work.

17:05.191 --> 17:07.592
Your team, your life.

17:07.594 --> 17:08.760
I have nothing.

17:08.762 --> 17:10.694
I gave it all up for a family.

17:10.696 --> 17:12.030
But now etienne's gone...

17:13.333 --> 17:17.769
We will do whatever it is we need to do.

17:17.771 --> 17:21.638
To make them pay for killing our son.

17:21.641 --> 17:23.141
Whatever.

17:24.710 --> 17:25.710
Yes.

17:25.712 --> 17:27.545
And then...

17:27.547 --> 17:30.081
We'll get on with our lives.

17:30.083 --> 17:33.117
Yes.

17:35.154 --> 17:38.256
You know, I've been thinking.

17:38.258 --> 17:42.758
We need time for you and me.

17:42.796 --> 17:46.130
Like a long holiday.

17:46.132 --> 17:48.800
When it's over.

17:48.802 --> 17:53.071
Louis...

17:53.073 --> 17:56.707
By "getting on with our lives,"

17:56.709 --> 17:58.176
I mean a divorce.

18:06.418 --> 18:07.652
I'm going home to Paris.

18:07.654 --> 18:09.554
Get there as soon you can.

18:09.556 --> 18:11.201
So we can do what needs to be done...

18:12.392 --> 18:16.160
And I can leave that apartment forever.

18:16.162 --> 18:17.395
Answer your phone.

18:17.397 --> 18:20.498
The job is calling.

18:29.308 --> 18:31.109
And there's another one nearby?

18:31.111 --> 18:33.344
Yeah, just across
the border in Slovenia.

18:33.346 --> 18:35.480
But you don't know they're connected?

18:35.482 --> 18:36.814
Sir, I know for sure.

18:36.816 --> 18:38.749
The man they say is responsible
for the first one.

18:38.751 --> 18:40.184
Is not who they say he is.

18:40.186 --> 18:41.752
There's definitely
something odd going on there,

18:41.754 --> 18:43.354
something criminal.

18:43.356 --> 18:47.125
Sergeant, as charmed as I am
by your passion,

18:47.127 --> 18:49.527
I cannot go into the court and say,

18:49.529 --> 18:53.164
"there's something odd going on there."

18:53.166 --> 18:55.333
It's my professional judgment
that this is something.

18:55.335 --> 18:57.602
That absolutely falls
under our purview.

18:57.604 --> 18:59.537
I'd stake my reputation on it.

18:59.539 --> 19:01.639
Sergeant vittoria,

19:01.641 --> 19:03.908
would you excuse us, please?

19:13.218 --> 19:14.752
Sit down.

19:22.327 --> 19:24.262
So you're willing to stake
your reputation on it?

19:24.264 --> 19:25.363
Absolutely.

19:25.365 --> 19:26.565
And who exactly.

19:26.566 --> 19:29.333
Do you think you are reputed to be?

19:29.335 --> 19:31.169
How about I was
a New York City detective.

19:31.171 --> 19:34.338
You are a drug addict,
detective hickman.

19:34.340 --> 19:36.174
Recovering drug addict.

19:36.176 --> 19:37.875
It's my understanding.

19:37.877 --> 19:39.644
That you've recently begun shooting up.

19:39.646 --> 19:41.612
Fairly recently, but that's only...

19:41.614 --> 19:44.482
A numbing agent. I know. I heard.

19:44.484 --> 19:47.285
I have no idea why Louis decided.

19:47.287 --> 19:49.453
That you would be the person
to take charge.

19:49.455 --> 19:51.322
In his absence,

19:51.324 --> 19:52.390
but his trust in you.

19:52.392 --> 19:56.260
Is what is meaningful to me today,

19:56.262 --> 19:57.929
not your willingness.

19:57.931 --> 20:01.499
To stake your tattered reputation.

20:01.501 --> 20:04.735
Well, I have no idea why
he put me in charge either.

20:04.737 --> 20:05.836
But he did.

20:05.838 --> 20:07.872
Now, I'd love to sit with you someday.

20:07.874 --> 20:10.841
And the hell that I live
through every damned minute.

20:10.843 --> 20:12.276
To stay off them,

20:12.278 --> 20:13.978
despite medically needing them,

20:13.980 --> 20:15.913
just to function on this team.

20:15.915 --> 20:18.382
But right now.

20:18.384 --> 20:20.818
What I need from you.

20:20.820 --> 20:24.855
To let us handle
these moving mass murderers.

20:26.892 --> 20:28.593
Have you already
sent your team out there?

20:28.595 --> 20:30.995
McConnell and berger
are there at the second scene.

20:30.997 --> 20:32.597
They haven't done anything,

20:32.599 --> 20:34.232
and I can certainly call them back.

20:34.234 --> 20:36.267
No.

20:36.269 --> 20:37.001
Let them do their work.

20:37.003 --> 20:39.770
I'll deal with the court.

20:41.406 --> 20:44.575
Stop whoever it is
who is killing people out there.

20:55.020 --> 20:56.454
Okay. That must be her.

20:57.756 --> 20:59.557
Tommy McConnell.
This is Sebastian berger.

20:59.559 --> 21:00.925
We're from the icc.

21:00.927 --> 21:05.427
Good. Do you mind
if I take a look around?

21:07.033 --> 21:08.299
Please.

21:32.691 --> 21:35.626
There were five shooters
firing at a car here.

21:35.628 --> 21:38.029
Someone fired two shots
from back there,

21:38.031 --> 21:39.664
hit one of them, then left.

21:48.841 --> 21:52.943
Would have left
a residue of its tire tracks.

21:52.945 --> 21:55.546
Let me isolate one.

21:55.548 --> 21:58.816
I can run that through
tire pattern databases...

22:00.018 --> 22:01.719
Okay, that tire, that pattern,

22:01.721 --> 22:03.054
that weight and that wheelbase,

22:03.056 --> 22:07.491
we're probably looking
for a 2011 BMW convertible.

22:07.493 --> 22:08.693
Convertible?

22:08.695 --> 22:09.827
There's only tail light glass there,

22:09.829 --> 22:12.596
he said they shot back, right?

22:12.598 --> 22:14.498
Hard to do without breaking windows.

22:14.500 --> 22:15.533
And it's black!

22:15.535 --> 22:17.101
Paint transfers.

22:17.103 --> 22:19.603
Low tech, but effective.

22:21.107 --> 22:23.641
To be on the lookout for that car.

22:23.643 --> 22:25.543
Right, okay.

22:25.545 --> 22:28.746
Five guys with machine guns
shooting from here.

22:28.748 --> 22:30.047
They let that car back out and leave?

22:30.049 --> 22:32.983
That whole area back there
should be full of holes.

22:32.985 --> 22:36.020
It's like they didn't want to hit them.

22:36.022 --> 22:37.623
They didn't want to hit one of them.

22:38.123 --> 22:39.623
Help!

22:39.625 --> 22:40.791
Help!

22:40.793 --> 22:42.126
They shot him!

23:01.681 --> 23:02.947
Angela?
<i>- Papa?</i>

23:02.949 --> 23:04.949
Angela, where are you?

23:18.797 --> 23:21.065
They're still working on him.

23:22.667 --> 23:25.870
These are gunshot wounds.
Call the police.

23:30.475 --> 23:31.942
He said it was going to be easy.

23:31.944 --> 23:34.845
We'd watched it for weeks.

23:34.847 --> 23:36.614
No one even really guarded the stuff.

23:36.616 --> 23:37.748
They were lazy.

23:37.750 --> 23:39.049
Why, Antonio?

23:39.051 --> 23:40.951
Why steal from my father?

23:47.794 --> 23:51.695
Your father took over all
the land around our area,

23:51.697 --> 23:52.897
including our farms.

23:52.899 --> 23:54.832
With the help of a corrupt judge,

23:54.834 --> 23:57.868
he stole all the land
from under everyone.

23:57.870 --> 24:00.838
Then he forced them
to grow drugs instead of food.

24:03.542 --> 24:06.744
Then the police eventually
raided the farms,

24:06.746 --> 24:11.015
who had no control over
what the tenants were doing.

24:14.886 --> 24:16.720
Instead of the humiliation of prison,

24:16.722 --> 24:18.589
my father hung himself in our barn.

24:24.596 --> 24:25.896
Of course, it's up to us now.

24:25.898 --> 24:27.998
To take care of my mother and sisters,

24:28.000 --> 24:29.867
but the army took the property away,

24:29.869 --> 24:33.971
said we lost it
when we used it for drugs, so...

24:36.843 --> 24:37.908
That's why.

24:37.910 --> 24:39.777
That's why we decided.

24:39.779 --> 24:42.079
To take some money from your father,

24:42.081 --> 24:45.149
to survive.

24:45.151 --> 24:47.952
I'm so sorry.

24:49.855 --> 24:50.921
It's not you.

24:50.923 --> 24:54.792
It's not you, it's your father.

25:05.103 --> 25:06.871
Eva vittoria,

25:06.873 --> 25:09.507
still the most beautiful
woman in Italy.

25:11.142 --> 25:12.977
Nicola Conti.

25:12.979 --> 25:15.112
Still pretending to be
a legitimate businessman.

25:15.114 --> 25:16.046
Eva...

25:16.048 --> 25:17.281
Sergeant vittoria.

25:17.283 --> 25:19.817
Must we be formal?

25:19.819 --> 25:22.152
Your father and I were like brothers.

25:22.154 --> 25:23.254
Brothers?

25:23.256 --> 25:25.089
And where is your brother today?

25:27.159 --> 25:29.560
That is especially hurtful.

25:29.562 --> 25:32.029
What kind of business
do you have here, Mr. Conti?

25:32.031 --> 25:33.197
As you see.

25:33.199 --> 25:34.164
Cartage, freight.

25:34.166 --> 25:36.100
Shipping and receiving.

25:36.102 --> 25:37.601
Why open a shipping business.

25:37.603 --> 25:39.270
As far from a port as you can be,

25:39.272 --> 25:40.905
along a stretch of narrow roads.

25:40.907 --> 25:41.972
With impossible traffic.

25:41.974 --> 25:44.275
And no rail road nearby?

25:44.277 --> 25:46.010
Are you a police officer?

25:46.012 --> 25:48.112
Why open your business here?

25:48.114 --> 25:52.082
A favorable deal on the property.

25:52.084 --> 25:53.884
Now the big question.

25:53.886 --> 25:55.086
Who was bleeding?

25:55.087 --> 25:57.121
Bleeding?

26:00.191 --> 26:02.059
Do we have any fluid
collection supplies?

26:04.563 --> 26:06.297
There you go.

26:15.206 --> 26:16.406
That could be anything.

26:17.909 --> 26:20.144
Maybe you haven't seen
enough blood in your life.

26:20.146 --> 26:22.713
Maybe a worker got hurt.

26:22.715 --> 26:25.649
Maybe he got hurt in there.

26:25.651 --> 26:27.718
Excuse me?

26:27.720 --> 26:29.219
Might even still be in there, bleeding.

26:29.221 --> 26:32.222
Maybe we should have a look in there.

26:32.224 --> 26:34.291
You want to go into the warehouse?

26:34.293 --> 26:36.093
Very much so.

26:36.095 --> 26:39.163
I tremble with anticipation.

26:39.165 --> 26:42.733
We already have an
authorization on the way.

26:42.735 --> 26:44.768
From the international criminal court.

26:47.005 --> 26:48.205
Then we'll wait.

26:49.608 --> 26:51.342
We'll wait.

26:52.210 --> 26:53.677
<i>A unit was dispatched,</i>

26:53.679 --> 26:55.012
<i>but there's been no response.</i>

26:55.014 --> 26:56.380
Okay, we're at the hospital now.

26:56.382 --> 26:57.748
There's the BMW.

27:22.842 --> 27:24.408
You need a doctor.

27:24.410 --> 27:25.342
No...

27:25.344 --> 27:27.111
No doctors.

27:27.113 --> 27:28.712
They killed paolo.

27:28.714 --> 27:29.713
They killed him.

27:29.715 --> 27:32.316
I'm so sorry.

27:35.221 --> 27:37.721
I'll be back, okay? I'll be back.

27:37.723 --> 27:39.123
Where are you going?
Where are you going?

27:39.125 --> 27:41.358
To see if it's clear.
We can't stay here.

27:41.360 --> 27:43.694
I'll be back.

27:59.211 --> 28:00.344
Excuse me.

28:00.346 --> 28:01.812
I'll be here.

28:05.316 --> 28:06.316
Where are you?

28:06.318 --> 28:08.285
They're just scared boys,

28:08.287 --> 28:10.320
and they're just trying
to help their family.

28:10.322 --> 28:11.255
I promise.

28:11.257 --> 28:12.823
<i>My love,</i>

28:12.825 --> 28:14.825
listen to me.

28:14.827 --> 28:17.261
It's very common
to feel sorry for someone.

28:17.263 --> 28:19.730
<i>Who has you hostage.</i>

28:19.732 --> 28:21.231
Just tell me where you are,

28:21.233 --> 28:22.933
and giancarlo will come get you.

28:22.935 --> 28:25.335
<i>I'm not feeling sorry!</i>

28:25.337 --> 28:27.304
<i>It's giancarlo's killing people.</i>

28:27.306 --> 28:28.806
He's killed innocent people.

28:28.808 --> 28:29.973
He killed paolo!

28:29.975 --> 28:31.341
Who is paolo?

28:31.343 --> 28:32.910
<i>He's one of the boys.</i>

28:32.912 --> 28:34.378
<i>He's Antonio's brother.</i>

28:34.380 --> 28:35.979
You're worried about them?

28:35.981 --> 28:38.415
<i>Do not blame giancarlo</i>
<i>for doing his job.</i>

28:38.417 --> 28:40.451
<i>He is trying to rescue you.</i>

28:40.453 --> 28:43.320
Tell them to give you
and my property back,

28:43.322 --> 28:46.490
<i>and it will all end.</i>

28:46.492 --> 28:49.359
Your property?

29:01.840 --> 29:02.940
Stop, please!

29:02.942 --> 29:03.907
Please, stop! Stop!

29:03.909 --> 29:05.509
Please, sir...

29:05.511 --> 29:07.311
I don't want to hurt you.

29:07.313 --> 29:08.979
Sir, I just really need your car.

29:08.981 --> 29:10.848
Come on, step out. Come on.

29:13.251 --> 29:14.451
Sorry, sir...

29:14.453 --> 29:16.019
Throw me the bag.

29:16.021 --> 29:17.221
Whoa, whoa, I surrender.

29:21.793 --> 29:22.793
Are those gunshots?

29:22.795 --> 29:24.027
What did you do?

29:24.029 --> 29:26.396
Angela, what did you do?

29:27.465 --> 29:28.866
Let's go.

29:33.004 --> 29:34.004
Enough.

29:34.006 --> 29:36.874
I'm going to a police station
to turn myself in.

29:36.876 --> 29:39.042
We're almost in Italy, Antonio.

29:39.044 --> 29:40.511
Then what?

29:40.513 --> 29:43.313
Spend the rest of my life
hiding from him?

29:43.315 --> 29:45.916
Or worse, waiting for my mother
and sisters to be killed?

29:45.918 --> 29:48.485
It's over, Angela.

29:48.487 --> 29:51.488
What about me? What do I do now?

29:52.791 --> 29:53.991
You go home.

29:55.326 --> 29:56.326
How am I supposed to go home now?

29:56.328 --> 29:57.928
You have a good life!

29:57.930 --> 29:58.929
No, I don't!

29:58.931 --> 30:00.330
I have a lie!

30:00.332 --> 30:02.833
I can't pretend I don't, never again!

30:02.835 --> 30:04.968
Everything has changed, Antonio.

30:13.878 --> 30:15.445
What are they doing?
- I don't know!

30:15.447 --> 30:17.881
He knows, Antonio.
He's looking right at me.

30:17.883 --> 30:19.083
What?

30:46.444 --> 30:47.644
Are you okay?

31:04.262 --> 31:05.896
Don't waste any more shot.

31:05.898 --> 31:07.397
They aren't going far.

31:07.399 --> 31:08.599
We'll get them at the bottom.

31:08.601 --> 31:10.868
Hurry up, let's go.

31:17.409 --> 31:21.111
We went through the whole building.

31:21.113 --> 31:21.879
It's completely empty.

31:21.881 --> 31:24.114
Now will you believe

31:24.116 --> 31:25.515
I am nothing but a simple businessman?

31:25.517 --> 31:26.717
Never.

31:28.387 --> 31:29.887
It's Tommy.

31:29.889 --> 31:31.021
They're still in Slovenia.

31:31.023 --> 31:31.989
Tommy?

31:31.991 --> 31:34.157
There's a fourth crime scene.

31:34.159 --> 31:36.159
Someone was shot here,
but there's no body.

31:36.161 --> 31:37.494
There's five more victims
back at a medical clinic.

31:37.496 --> 31:40.130
<i>The mass shootings aren't random.</i>

31:40.132 --> 31:41.498
They appear to be a moving gunfight.

31:41.500 --> 31:44.568
<i>Chasing a smaller group in a black BMW,</i>

31:44.570 --> 31:46.069
which is disabled.

31:46.071 --> 31:48.005
Outside the medical clinic
we just came from.

31:48.007 --> 31:50.140
Did you get anything out of the BMW?

31:50.142 --> 31:52.609
The seat, the way it's positioned,

31:52.611 --> 31:54.311
<i>i think one of the people we're chasing.</i>

31:54.313 --> 31:55.679
<i>Might be a woman.</i>

31:55.681 --> 31:57.080
Of course... you son of a bitch.

31:57.082 --> 31:58.215
Where is she?

31:58.217 --> 31:59.149
Who?

31:59.151 --> 32:00.150
Where's your daughter?

32:00.152 --> 32:01.352
Where's Angela?

32:02.320 --> 32:03.520
Give me your telephone.

32:04.123 --> 32:05.689
Give me your phone!
- Eva...

32:05.691 --> 32:08.091
Where is it?

32:09.093 --> 32:11.194
The last call he received,
I think it was her.

32:11.196 --> 32:12.663
Have Sebastian trap and trace it.

32:14.332 --> 32:16.033
Stop, stop!

32:23.174 --> 32:26.643
It's best not to fight, Angela.

32:26.645 --> 32:28.979
You'll only delay what will happen.

32:28.981 --> 32:30.280
Please...

32:30.282 --> 32:31.415
Please what?

32:31.417 --> 32:33.350
He's just a scared boy, giancarlo.

32:33.352 --> 32:34.151
You don't appreciate.

32:34.153 --> 32:35.485
What you have,

32:35.487 --> 32:37.321
and you never appreciate.

32:37.323 --> 32:39.523
Those who help you keep it.

32:39.525 --> 32:41.158
Men like me and Bruno.

32:41.160 --> 32:42.592
Have been dying protecting your family.

32:42.594 --> 32:44.194
For years.

32:44.196 --> 32:46.997
I never asked for that, giancarlo.

32:48.266 --> 32:49.733
Doesn't make you innocent.

32:49.735 --> 32:51.635
She's Mr. Conti's daughter.

32:54.672 --> 32:56.740
Mr. Conti's daughter,

32:56.742 --> 32:58.475
who...

32:58.477 --> 33:02.212
You will pay the price
for something you've done.

33:04.048 --> 33:05.248
Drop your weapon!

33:35.313 --> 33:36.513
You okay?

33:46.057 --> 33:47.691
Low tech, but effective, right?

33:51.195 --> 33:52.162
It's okay, we got them.

33:52.164 --> 33:53.730
Where is she?

33:53.732 --> 33:55.499
Don't worry about me, I'm fine.

33:55.501 --> 33:56.333
Where's Angela?

33:56.335 --> 33:59.703
They were right there.

34:00.738 --> 34:02.205
Angela!

34:03.409 --> 34:05.609
Leave us alone!

34:08.413 --> 34:09.612
There she is.

34:12.350 --> 34:14.818
We're not here to hurt you.

34:14.820 --> 34:16.553
Then go away!

34:16.554 --> 34:18.722
Look.

34:18.724 --> 34:20.389
Angela?

34:20.391 --> 34:22.626
Please...

34:22.628 --> 34:26.362
I'll put my gun down, okay?

34:26.364 --> 34:27.630
I said, leave us alone.

34:30.768 --> 34:33.603
I'm not going to use my gun.

34:34.839 --> 34:37.641
I promise.

34:37.643 --> 34:40.777
I just came from
your father's compound.

34:43.281 --> 34:47.117
The one he robbed
and kidnapped you from.

34:47.119 --> 34:49.619
He was just trying
to protect his family.

34:52.190 --> 34:54.658
But he caused a lot of people
to get hurt.

34:56.860 --> 34:58.528
But it wasn't him.

34:58.530 --> 35:01.531
It wasn't him. They did it.
They did it.

35:01.533 --> 35:03.200
And it was me.

35:03.202 --> 35:04.768
It was me they were trying to...

35:04.770 --> 35:06.203
It's my fault!

35:07.338 --> 35:08.572
Angela,

35:08.574 --> 35:10.640
Angela...

35:10.642 --> 35:11.842
Look at me.

35:14.145 --> 35:16.746
Do you remember me?

35:18.316 --> 35:18.782
No.

35:18.784 --> 35:20.250
I'm eva.

35:20.252 --> 35:22.419
Eva vittoria.

35:22.421 --> 35:26.523
When you were young, you lived in Rome.

35:26.525 --> 35:30.527
We met once.
I was home from university.

35:38.736 --> 35:40.871
Our fathers were...

35:46.644 --> 35:48.378
They did business together.

35:50.615 --> 35:52.382
My father doesn't do business.

35:52.384 --> 35:54.251
He's a killer and a drug dealer.

35:54.253 --> 35:55.886
I know.

36:02.927 --> 36:04.628
I know what it's like.

36:04.630 --> 36:07.264
To think your life is one thing,

36:07.266 --> 36:09.599
then find out it's another,

36:09.601 --> 36:12.636
that it's all a lie.

36:12.638 --> 36:14.404
When I was your age,

36:14.406 --> 36:17.240
my parents were murdered.

36:18.676 --> 36:21.611
Their car was blown up...

36:21.613 --> 36:23.947
By my father's business partner...

36:23.949 --> 36:25.882
Nicola Conti.

36:25.884 --> 36:27.184
No...

36:27.186 --> 36:30.253
After they died,

36:30.255 --> 36:31.922
I fully learned the truth.

36:31.924 --> 36:34.224
About where our luxury came from.

36:34.226 --> 36:36.393
It took a long time,

36:36.395 --> 36:40.764
but I also realized.

36:40.766 --> 36:43.867
That my past was gone.

36:43.869 --> 36:45.302
It had happened.

36:45.304 --> 36:46.603
It was what it was,

36:46.605 --> 36:48.338
and nothing I did could change it.

36:48.340 --> 36:51.441
You can't control your past,

36:51.443 --> 36:53.343
but alone,

36:53.345 --> 36:57.845
you can control and change your future.

36:58.317 --> 37:00.917
Okay?

37:10.928 --> 37:13.330
You can trust me.

37:13.332 --> 37:14.864
Okay?

37:22.406 --> 37:25.008
You're going to be fine.

37:25.010 --> 37:26.710
I promise.

37:26.712 --> 37:29.546
Okay?

37:33.284 --> 37:35.385
Hey, Tommy.

37:37.421 --> 37:39.923
They're good guys.

37:41.426 --> 37:44.761
Can you help me with him?

37:44.763 --> 37:48.331
You come with me.

37:48.333 --> 37:50.867
Okay...

37:52.470 --> 37:53.403
You okay?

37:53.405 --> 37:54.971
Yeah.
- Yeah?

37:54.973 --> 37:56.840
Okay...

39:07.545 --> 39:10.914
Kathrin, it's Sebastian. I, um...

39:10.916 --> 39:13.650
Listen, I...

39:13.652 --> 39:15.985
I had a...

39:15.987 --> 39:17.620
An interesting day,

39:17.622 --> 39:19.723
and it's got me
thinking about something.

39:19.725 --> 39:23.059
No, that's not true, um...

39:23.061 --> 39:25.829
I've been thinking about this a lot.

39:25.831 --> 39:29.566
Every day, in fact.

39:29.568 --> 39:32.535
I think we should talk.

39:32.537 --> 39:34.904
So... call me, okay?

39:34.906 --> 39:36.706
I'll be...

39:38.809 --> 39:40.076
Just call me?

39:40.078 --> 39:43.380
Thanks.

39:52.556 --> 39:53.623
Sebastian...

39:53.625 --> 39:55.625
I hear you made a nice shot today.

39:55.627 --> 39:57.093
Well...

39:57.095 --> 39:58.128
More luck than skill, really.

39:58.130 --> 40:01.097
I can relate.

40:03.134 --> 40:05.635
Kind of makes you think of
your own mortality, doesn't it?

40:05.637 --> 40:08.071
Yeah.

40:08.073 --> 40:09.273
But you did good.

40:12.978 --> 40:15.111
About that Anne-Marie thing?

40:15.113 --> 40:17.113
Damn.

40:17.115 --> 40:19.883
Yeah, she made a number of rescues,

40:19.885 --> 40:22.952
I talked to a sergeant in the area,

40:22.954 --> 40:24.120
who said, as far as he knew,

40:24.122 --> 40:26.890
and wanted to make
the first arraignment.

40:29.093 --> 40:31.060
I kind of figured
it was something like that.

40:34.031 --> 40:35.465
See you tomorrow.

40:53.017 --> 40:54.451
<i> Carl?</i>
<i>- </i> Hey.

40:54.453 --> 40:57.921
Something is going on here.

40:57.923 --> 40:58.888
They are going crazy.

40:58.890 --> 41:00.723
Who's going crazy?

41:00.725 --> 41:03.026
<i>Genovese, the manager.</i>

41:03.028 --> 41:04.727
I did that.

41:04.729 --> 41:06.830
You did?

41:06.832 --> 41:08.731
<i>I hit them where it hurts,</i>
<i>in the wallet.</i>
