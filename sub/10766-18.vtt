00:02.214 --> 00:04.512
Hilary, when is G getting back?
I'm starving.

00:04.583 --> 00:06.676
Don't worry, Will, I made breakfast.

00:07.286 --> 00:09.652
Damn, I'm full. Couldn't eat another bite.

00:11.056 --> 00:15.254
Come on, Will. I know what I'm doing.
Remember, I was a professional caterer.

00:15.327 --> 00:18.319
And you still would be
if you hadn't poisoned those nuns.

00:20.432 --> 00:22.525
The autopsy was inconclusive.

00:25.037 --> 00:26.402
<i>Bon app√©tit.</i>

00:30.776 --> 00:32.903
Come on, let's give her a chance.

00:39.551 --> 00:41.246
These eggs aren't bad.

00:47.392 --> 00:48.757
What's the crunchy stuff?

00:48.827 --> 00:50.852
Great, you found my contact.

00:52.000 --> 00:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:05.771 --> 02:07.136
Then who's the guy in the toga?

02:07.205 --> 02:10.606
That's Bill Reingold.
He's the president of Amatrax Oil.

02:11.043 --> 02:13.307
And the guy with his head in the toilet?

02:17.883 --> 02:20.477
That's Ben Winter.
He's a great heart surgeon.

02:20.585 --> 02:22.519
And the guy getting slapped by the girl?

02:23.522 --> 02:25.046
That's Clarence Thomas.

02:29.327 --> 02:33.286
What's going on, guys? Y ou're looking
at your old Princeton fraternity pictures?

02:33.365 --> 02:34.696
Will, please.

02:34.766 --> 02:37.496
Princeton doesn't have fraternities.
They have dining clubs.

02:37.569 --> 02:40.163
Where the leaders of tomorrow
break bread and plan the future.

02:40.238 --> 02:41.705
That's right, son.

02:41.773 --> 02:44.298
My dining club's what made me
the man I am today.

02:49.948 --> 02:51.745
No, that's too easy.

02:52.551 --> 02:54.678
And since you're my son...

02:54.753 --> 02:57.085
you're guaranteed my seat
in the club I joined.

02:58.256 --> 02:59.723
If you don't know which seat is his...

02:59.791 --> 03:02.487
it'll be the one with the legs all bent out
up from under it.

03:05.564 --> 03:08.260
Come on, I gave you a free one earlier.

03:08.633 --> 03:09.827
Carlton...

03:10.635 --> 03:12.660
what I'm about to do is strictly forbidden.

03:12.738 --> 03:14.069
But since you're going to Princeton...

03:14.139 --> 03:16.664
I'm going to teach you
my club's secret handshake.

03:17.442 --> 03:18.773
Turn around, Will.

03:19.611 --> 03:22.774
Y ou gotta be facing somebody's butt
to do this handshake?

03:24.583 --> 03:26.073
It's a secret.

03:26.685 --> 03:29.085
I don't see what the big deal is
about Princeton anyway.

03:29.154 --> 03:31.281
Simple, they're interviewing
at Bel-Air Prep this week.

03:31.356 --> 03:33.347
They're looking for a few good men.

03:33.492 --> 03:35.084
Darn, Carlton.

03:35.160 --> 03:38.527
If they was looking for a few
good Pygmies, you'd have been a shoe in.

03:39.431 --> 03:41.228
Face it, ghetto goof...

03:41.299 --> 03:44.496
there's no one at Bel-Air Prep
that comes close to having my grades...

03:44.569 --> 03:46.400
or my willingness
to flatter authority figures...

03:46.471 --> 03:48.701
without a thought to personal dignity.

03:49.307 --> 03:51.241
They'll be lucky to have you, son.

03:51.443 --> 03:53.468
And you're the guy who taught me.

03:53.545 --> 03:56.105
By the way, you look really great in denim.

03:57.282 --> 03:58.442
See?

03:59.518 --> 04:01.577
So, Will, have you scheduled
your interview?

04:01.653 --> 04:04.451
Man, I tell you, you ain't got
to worry about me applying...

04:04.523 --> 04:08.050
to no old Bugie or Muffy and Biffo...

04:08.360 --> 04:10.988
chicken-head old kind of...

04:13.832 --> 04:16.665
I just didn't have a chance
to get around to it yet, Uncle Phil.

04:16.735 --> 04:17.928
Do it tomorrow.

04:18.870 --> 04:19.995
Wait.

04:20.071 --> 04:22.801
Come on, Uncle Phil, I've already decided
where I wanna go.

04:22.874 --> 04:26.571
Will, the standards of the Jim-Bob
School of Trucking are pretty darn high.

04:34.753 --> 04:36.277
Look, man,
what are you doing here anyway?

04:36.354 --> 04:38.185
Y our appointment isn't till tomorrow.

04:38.256 --> 04:41.453
Simple, I'm here to pick up
the shattered pieces of your self-esteem...

04:41.526 --> 04:43.221
to nourish you in your hour of defeat.

04:43.295 --> 04:45.024
And do you know why, Will?

04:45.430 --> 04:47.193
Because when I come out of here
a broken man...

04:47.265 --> 04:49.825
you wanna be the first person
to rub my nose in it?

04:50.669 --> 04:52.569
No, I'm really here for you, Will.

04:52.637 --> 04:54.730
Then why did you bring a video camera?

04:58.043 --> 05:00.807
- Mr. Will Smith.
- Y o.

05:01.446 --> 05:02.435
"Y o"?

05:04.583 --> 05:07.381
So, Mr. Smith...

05:07.886 --> 05:09.649
you want to go to Princeton.

05:10.388 --> 05:14.085
Well, actually, I wanna go to Sea World,
but is Princeton along the way?

05:18.096 --> 05:19.563
Y ou're funny.

05:19.865 --> 05:21.799
We frown on that at Princeton.

05:22.801 --> 05:23.961
Okay.

05:24.703 --> 05:26.330
Look, actually, I gotta be honest with you.

05:26.404 --> 05:30.067
I just came because my uncle made me.
I really don't wanna go to Princeton.

05:30.141 --> 05:32.632
<i>E</i> verybody wants to go to Princeton.

05:32.811 --> 05:34.278
Well, not me, <i>amigo.</i>

05:35.947 --> 05:37.710
Then you're in luck, Mr. Smith.

05:38.149 --> 05:40.174
Y our scores are mediocre...

05:40.385 --> 05:43.479
your grades would make
an impressive batting average...

05:43.655 --> 05:47.056
and your extracurricular activities
are non-existent.

05:47.125 --> 05:50.617
Unless one counts detention,
in which case you lead the league.

05:51.863 --> 05:54.661
But my jacket is a fashion miracle, though,
isn't it?

05:55.567 --> 05:58.127
In short, you're not Princeton material.

05:58.303 --> 06:00.203
And your hat is on backwards.

06:00.272 --> 06:02.365
We frown on that at Princeton.

06:02.440 --> 06:04.704
Y'all frown on a lot of stuff at Princeton.

06:04.843 --> 06:07.209
Bunch of sad-Iooking people
walking around...

06:12.717 --> 06:14.617
Look, actually, sir...

06:14.686 --> 06:17.348
I just really don't know
what Princeton would have to offer me.

06:17.422 --> 06:19.754
I mean, are there any cute honeys?

06:20.258 --> 06:21.782
Mr. Smith...

06:21.993 --> 06:25.429
Princeton has some of the most intelligent
young women in the country.

06:25.497 --> 06:29.831
There's no way I would make a crass
generalization about such a diverse group.

06:30.468 --> 06:31.799
Any cute honeys?

06:32.637 --> 06:33.626
No.

06:36.408 --> 06:39.241
Well, then I guess my work here is done.

06:39.644 --> 06:41.168
But as a parting gift...

06:47.118 --> 06:48.517
here you go.

06:54.359 --> 06:55.451
How did you do that?

06:55.527 --> 06:57.722
I've been working on this thing
for months.

06:57.829 --> 07:00.024
Y eah, well, take care, buddy.

07:01.299 --> 07:02.732
Wait a minute.

08:00.225 --> 08:02.352
- Oh, man.
- Y ou get your <i>E</i> nglish scores up...

08:02.427 --> 08:05.328
and I'll recommend that you get accepted
into Princeton.

08:05.430 --> 08:09.696
- Look, I don't know, <i>E</i> d, it's just...
- Please, for me.

08:11.903 --> 08:13.666
It would mean a lot.

08:13.905 --> 08:15.566
All right, I'll think about it.

08:15.940 --> 08:17.407
Peace out, <i>E</i>- Money.

08:25.583 --> 08:26.811
Piece of cake.

08:30.755 --> 08:32.347
What's the capital of Burma?

08:32.424 --> 08:34.517
- Look, man, I don't know.
- Rangoon.

08:34.592 --> 08:36.423
Six hundred and forty acres is?

08:36.494 --> 08:38.860
I don't know,
the size of Barry White's hot tub.

08:40.131 --> 08:41.393
A square mile.

08:41.466 --> 08:45.368
Who said, "It is better to die on your feet
than live on your knees"?

08:45.603 --> 08:47.696
I'm guessing that one wasn't Madonna.

08:49.774 --> 08:51.366
<i>E</i> miliano Zapata.

08:51.443 --> 08:53.968
They made a mistake.
Y ou don't deserve to go to Princeton.

08:54.045 --> 08:55.842
Wait a minute, Will...

08:56.815 --> 08:59.010
Princeton is considering you?

08:59.217 --> 09:01.617
Considering me?
Begging me is more like it.

09:01.686 --> 09:04.553
I mean, them people
just will not take "no" for an answer.

09:04.622 --> 09:07.182
- Y ou turned them down?
- A bunch of times.

09:07.258 --> 09:09.988
But you know, dude started getting
all weepy-eyed and everything...

09:10.061 --> 09:12.120
so I told him I'd sleep on it.

09:12.197 --> 09:14.529
How'd you do it, Will? The truth.

09:15.500 --> 09:18.731
Carlton, I was just myself.
I guess that was good enough.

09:18.803 --> 09:20.202
This is Princeton, Will.

09:20.271 --> 09:23.502
They don't want people who
are themselves. They want people like me.

09:24.476 --> 09:25.841
Now, fess up.

09:25.910 --> 09:29.744
I told you, Carlton, I was just myself.
We talked.

09:29.814 --> 09:31.975
I told him about the hood back in Philly.

09:32.050 --> 09:34.951
And he told me about some stuff
called Spam.

09:36.754 --> 09:40.315
Y ou know, if you're getting a shot
at Princeton, that's pretty impressive.

09:41.059 --> 09:42.822
I'm proud of you, son.

09:43.862 --> 09:46.353
Proud enough to let me use
the Volvo next weekend?

09:48.633 --> 09:49.725
Sure.

09:52.070 --> 09:53.970
Did my lips say Volvo?

09:54.172 --> 09:55.867
My lips meant to say Jag.

09:56.875 --> 09:58.069
Why not?

10:01.980 --> 10:05.711
Y ou know what, Uncle Phil, I think
I might like this Princeton thing after all.

10:05.783 --> 10:07.648
Y ou think you can show me
that handshake?

10:07.719 --> 10:10.347
Well, okay, but we can't show it
to strangers, you know.

10:20.698 --> 10:22.996
Mr. Carlton Banks?

10:25.970 --> 10:27.403
Y o, what's up?

10:39.250 --> 10:41.616
- Sorry.
- That's all right.

10:42.487 --> 10:45.183
I've been looking through
your transcript, Mr. Banks.

10:45.256 --> 10:49.215
Y ou don't have to call me Mr. Banks.
My posse calls me Rap Master C.

10:50.328 --> 10:51.590
<i>E</i> xcuse me?

10:51.696 --> 10:55.598
Rap Master is my name.
Ask me again and I'll tell you the same.

11:00.505 --> 11:03.531
Didn't mean to dis you,
can I get you a tissue?

11:05.577 --> 11:07.374
So, Rap Master...

11:07.845 --> 11:11.679
I noticed that you are the treasurer
of your y oung Republican Club.

11:11.849 --> 11:13.248
Three years running.

11:13.318 --> 11:15.081
But enough about that Bugie stuff.

11:15.153 --> 11:17.383
Let me teach you how to vogue.
Strike a pose.

11:20.024 --> 11:22.993
Mr. Banks, are you on
some sort of medication?

11:24.896 --> 11:26.591
Let me teach you how to wear a hat.

11:26.664 --> 11:28.097
Mr. Banks, please.

11:29.334 --> 11:32.633
Mr. Banks, you're nothing like
what I expected.

11:32.870 --> 11:33.928
I'm not?

11:34.005 --> 11:37.099
Y our scores are topnotch
and your grades couldn't be better.

11:37.175 --> 11:38.164
They are.

11:38.309 --> 11:40.675
Unfortunately, at this time...

11:40.745 --> 11:44.146
Princeton doesn't accept
the clinically insane.

11:44.215 --> 11:45.546
Next!

11:54.058 --> 11:56.026
That's it?

11:56.094 --> 11:58.028
That's it. Close the door when you leave.

11:58.096 --> 11:59.688
There must be some mistake.

11:59.797 --> 12:02.027
Princeton's the only place
I've ever wanted to go.

12:02.100 --> 12:04.034
It's the centerpiece
of my life's master plan.

12:04.102 --> 12:06.593
- I hardly think you...
- y ou think I'm exaggerating?

12:06.671 --> 12:08.571
Look, this is my master plan.

12:10.508 --> 12:12.066
See where Princeton comes in?

12:13.645 --> 12:15.738
Right after "lose virginity."

12:18.082 --> 12:20.482
Y ou're even stranger than I thought.

12:21.519 --> 12:24.886
Thank you for your interest in Princeton,
Rap Master...

12:24.956 --> 12:26.719
it's time for my 3:30.

12:26.791 --> 12:28.918
Look, please don't do this to me.

12:29.027 --> 12:31.996
Do you want me to beg?
I'm begging you. Anything you want.

12:32.063 --> 12:35.191
Y ou know, my sister Hilary's not
bad-Iooking and after two drinks or so...

12:35.266 --> 12:37.063
she'll do just about anything, so...

12:37.969 --> 12:41.405
- Are you through?
- My dad's got money. A lot of money.

12:41.472 --> 12:43.440
And if you played your cards right
he just might...

12:43.508 --> 12:44.998
- Goodbye.
- Look, <i>E</i> d...

12:46.711 --> 12:48.542
you seem like an intelligent man.

12:48.613 --> 12:50.376
A man who knows
what's good for himself.

12:50.448 --> 12:52.780
Accepting me would be very good
for you, <i>E</i> d...

12:52.850 --> 12:55.045
because I have friends. Big friends.

12:55.119 --> 12:58.282
Big friends with lots of body hair
and mozzarella on their breath.

12:58.356 --> 12:59.550
<i>Capisce?</i>

12:59.924 --> 13:02.893
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but was that a death threat?

13:14.005 --> 13:15.973
- So how'd it go, son?
- Did they accept you?

13:16.040 --> 13:17.632
Did you even have to ask?

13:17.709 --> 13:20.735
They're not just accepting me,
they're giving me a full scholarship.

13:20.812 --> 13:23.246
Y es! Oh, God. Congratulations.

13:23.581 --> 13:25.879
We are so proud of you!

13:26.417 --> 13:28.009
Good going, C.

13:28.086 --> 13:29.576
Can I have your dresser?

13:31.122 --> 13:35.218
I can't believe this.
A full scholarship? That's amazing.

13:35.460 --> 13:37.985
I guess all that hard work paid off.

13:38.529 --> 13:41.862
Philip, we're gonna have to have a party,
invite all of Carlton' s friends.

13:41.933 --> 13:43.730
- I can't come.
- Why not?

13:44.035 --> 13:46.526
Because Carlton doesn't have
any friends...

13:47.372 --> 13:49.237
and I'll have to dance with him.

13:50.274 --> 13:53.243
Mom, I appreciate the thought,
but let's not go overboard.

13:53.878 --> 13:56.438
No. Now, this seems to call for a new car.

13:57.148 --> 13:59.048
How about one of those
little convertibles, huh?

13:59.117 --> 14:00.744
Princeton orange.

14:00.985 --> 14:03.647
- Sure, Dad, but...
- No buts, Carlton.

14:05.523 --> 14:07.218
Y ou have made me so proud.

14:07.725 --> 14:09.158
I made my bed.

14:11.229 --> 14:12.423
- I'll get it.
- I'll get it.

14:12.497 --> 14:14.089
- No, I'll get it.
- I'll get it.

14:16.200 --> 14:17.189
Hello?

14:17.735 --> 14:19.794
It's Mr. Robinson, your principal.

14:19.871 --> 14:22.738
Well, you're a little late, sir,
I just heard the good news.

14:24.375 --> 14:25.364
That's impossible.

14:25.443 --> 14:29.004
How could he get suspended
after he just got a full scholarship?

14:31.983 --> 14:34.008
I'll call you back.

14:34.886 --> 14:36.376
Y eah, goodbye.

14:37.555 --> 14:39.147
Philip, what's going on?

14:42.994 --> 14:44.086
Carlton...

14:44.896 --> 14:48.593
tell me you didn't threaten
to kill the man from Princeton.

14:49.967 --> 14:51.400
Oh, my God.

14:51.469 --> 14:54.165
- Dad, l...
- Just tell me that, please.

14:58.009 --> 14:59.237
I can't.

15:12.723 --> 15:15.658
Y o, C, you look bad, man.

15:16.294 --> 15:18.285
Stop trying to butter me up, Will.

15:18.362 --> 15:20.455
Come on, baby, give Mama a kiss.

15:20.531 --> 15:21.657
Look, go away.

15:22.133 --> 15:24.829
Come on, Mama knows, child, come on.

15:24.902 --> 15:26.893
Stop, Will, it's not funny.

15:26.971 --> 15:28.962
Y ou ruined my life, you...

15:29.340 --> 15:31.137
you big poopy.

15:33.010 --> 15:35.137
Y ou get everything you want
without trying.

15:35.213 --> 15:38.546
Y ou get picked first for teams,
the cutest girls, everything. Why?

15:39.050 --> 15:41.348
'Cause I don't say stuff like "big poopy"?

15:43.454 --> 15:46.048
Why don't you just go back to Philly?

15:49.160 --> 15:51.390
Do I detect a little hostility?

15:53.698 --> 15:56.030
Y ou owe me some flowers, mister.

16:07.445 --> 16:11.438
<i>Now /ook, you mustn't ta/k /ike that.</i>
<i>/ won't get my wings with that attitude.</i>

16:11.616 --> 16:13.777
<i>/ don't know, / guess you're right.</i>

16:15.953 --> 16:18.820
<i>/ suppose it wou/d have been better</i>
<i>if /'d never been born at a//.</i>

16:18.890 --> 16:19.948
<i>What did you say?</i>

16:20.024 --> 16:22.117
<i>/ said, "/ wish /'d never been born."</i>

16:22.527 --> 16:24.222
Y ou and me both, pal.

16:31.502 --> 16:32.867
What the...

16:45.249 --> 16:48.878
Oh, my God, it's Tom Jones.
What are you doing here?

16:48.953 --> 16:50.978
Well, I'm your guardian angel.

16:52.490 --> 16:56.392
No offense, Tom, but I always thought
my guardian angel would be black.

16:56.827 --> 16:58.351
Well, I knew Otis Redding.

16:59.730 --> 17:02.426
Well, anyway, I'm glad you came.

17:02.733 --> 17:03.825
I've been so unhappy.

17:03.901 --> 17:05.892
I know. Break it down to me.

17:08.806 --> 17:10.364
Tell me what's wrong.

17:11.075 --> 17:13.703
Well, it's kind of hard to put into words.

17:15.112 --> 17:16.101
I know.

18:34.025 --> 18:37.392
Tom, you're the best guardian angel
a guy could ever ask for.

18:38.095 --> 18:40.962
Do you think you could change history
so that I've never been born?

18:41.032 --> 18:42.056
Well, not quite.

18:42.133 --> 18:46.092
But I could probably pull some strings
and have you moved opposite Roseanne.

18:47.371 --> 18:50.465
But before I do that I want you to see
what things would be like...

18:50.541 --> 18:52.236
if you didn't exist.

18:56.247 --> 18:58.738
- I'm coming now. Come on, shoot.
- Okay.

18:59.517 --> 19:02.645
He dribbles down, he turns into Darryl
Dawkins, he's breaks the backboard.

19:13.197 --> 19:15.461
What happened, and where's Mom?

19:16.000 --> 19:19.094
Well, without you, your family
was defenseless against Will.

19:19.170 --> 19:22.367
Y ou see, they started to focus
on happiness instead of success.

19:22.573 --> 19:24.507
Y our mother ran away with the milkman...

19:25.543 --> 19:27.670
your father quit his practice to paint...

19:28.813 --> 19:30.940
Ashley does nothing but dance all day...

19:31.382 --> 19:33.976
and Hilary just does her hair.

19:34.952 --> 19:37.443
Well, maybe not everything changed.

19:39.790 --> 19:41.849
But they're not making any money.

19:41.926 --> 19:45.259
I mean, so what if they're happy?
How are they going to afford this house...

19:45.329 --> 19:47.388
our cars, our club memberships?

19:47.465 --> 19:49.262
Well, they can't. They're gonna lose it all.

19:49.333 --> 19:51.062
Happiness has ruined them.

19:51.135 --> 19:52.466
I've gotta save them.

19:52.536 --> 19:55.061
I've got to teach them about greed
and social climbing...

19:55.139 --> 19:57.334
and how to claim your dog
as a dependent.

19:57.842 --> 19:59.833
Now that's the Carlton I know.

19:59.910 --> 20:01.138
Maestro.

20:42.720 --> 20:44.153
Good morning, Will.

20:44.688 --> 20:46.121
"Good morning"?

20:47.191 --> 20:50.718
Y ou sure you don't mean,
"Die, you gravy-sucking pig"?

20:52.797 --> 20:57.131
Will, I spoke out of turn earlier.
I had no right to attack you the way I did.

20:59.637 --> 21:01.264
That's cool, man.

21:01.372 --> 21:03.840
Plus, I decided I don't even want to go
to Princeton, you know?

21:03.908 --> 21:06.103
So I called up <i>E</i> d
and I put the good word in for you.

21:06.177 --> 21:08.441
And he's giving me another chance?

21:08.512 --> 21:10.912
Well, no, he still thinks you kind of crazy.

21:12.049 --> 21:14.882
But he'd like to take Hilary out
for cocktails.

21:19.723 --> 21:22.988
Will, would you excuse us, please?
I'd like to talk to Carlton alone.

21:24.395 --> 21:27.091
Go easy on him, Uncle Phil. He's a moron.

21:29.266 --> 21:31.996
Dad, before you start, I just wanna say...

21:32.069 --> 21:34.299
I'm sorry about the death threat.

21:35.072 --> 21:38.735
Son, I admit that wasn't exactly
the bright spot of my day...

21:39.243 --> 21:42.542
but what really hurt the most
is that you lied to me.

21:42.980 --> 21:45.244
But I didn't know how to tell you.

21:45.316 --> 21:47.784
I mean, you were so happy
that Princeton wanted Will.

21:47.852 --> 21:49.683
I'd thought you'd like him more than me.

21:49.753 --> 21:51.311
I could never like Will.

21:51.388 --> 21:53.720
Well, I mean, I like him...

21:55.092 --> 21:57.322
Wait a minute, here I am lying to you.

21:58.929 --> 22:00.556
I really blew it.

22:00.664 --> 22:02.894
I'm sorry you won't get to go to Princeton.

22:02.967 --> 22:04.958
I know how much that meant to you.

22:05.936 --> 22:08.404
Dad, the only reason
I wanted to go to Princeton...

22:08.472 --> 22:10.030
is because I wanted to be like you.

22:10.107 --> 22:14.271
Y ou can't be like me, Carlton.
Or like Will, or like anybody else.

22:14.345 --> 22:16.142
Y ou can only be like you.

22:16.881 --> 22:18.371
There's no need to be cruel.

22:21.952 --> 22:23.010
Son...

22:24.855 --> 22:27.585
who you are is just fine with me.

22:28.459 --> 22:29.824
I mean that.

22:31.262 --> 22:32.524
Carlton.

22:33.397 --> 22:34.455
Y eah?

22:35.165 --> 22:36.393
Y ou're grounded.

22:38.936 --> 22:40.267
Thanks, Dad.

22:49.647 --> 22:52.172
Do I sense a little hostility?

22:54.318 --> 22:56.616
Y ou owe me some flowers, mister.

23:08.332 --> 23:09.959
<i>/ did that on purpose.</i>
