00:05.720 --> 00:07.961
(Reporter on TV) Iraq has
increased the level of its oil reserves

00:08.039 --> 00:11.522
by 24% since Saddam Hussein
was removed.

00:12.400 --> 00:15.768
The country has 133.1 billion barrels

00:15.840 --> 00:17.330
of extractable oil

00:17.600 --> 00:21.400
up from 115 billion barrels
estimated previously.

00:22.560 --> 00:24.369
- Under Saddam Hussein...
- Fucking bitch!

00:24.440 --> 00:26.886
- political isolation meant
little new exploratory work

00:26.960 --> 00:28.007
was undertaken.

00:29.320 --> 00:32.722
Closer to home, with the government
way ahead in the opinion polls,

00:32.800 --> 00:35.883
the focus of debate in
the upcoming general election today

00:36.120 --> 00:38.885
switched from the economy
to the domestic terror threat.

00:38.960 --> 00:40.121
(Ticking)

00:40.200 --> 00:42.123
The government claims
that domestic terror groups

00:42.200 --> 00:44.441
fractured since
Osama Bin Laden's death,

00:44.520 --> 00:46.887
and due to increased cooperation
with key Middle...

00:46.960 --> 00:48.405
Unbelievable!

00:49.600 --> 00:52.968
People have no idea about
the shit storm that's about to go down.

01:01.400 --> 01:02.481
Is this thing real?

01:02.560 --> 01:03.607
Don't play with it.

01:18.960 --> 01:20.325
Have I lost weight?

01:20.400 --> 01:22.243
Was gonna say you look different.

01:22.320 --> 01:24.641
I've lost weight. I mean, I feel good.

01:30.920 --> 01:32.490
It's 50 short.

01:36.400 --> 01:37.401
Get her out of here.

01:39.520 --> 01:41.363
What about my money?

01:41.440 --> 01:43.283
Get your hands off me.

01:43.480 --> 01:45.130
Don't touch me!

01:45.200 --> 01:46.690
You're still fat, Harry.

01:46.760 --> 01:48.171
- Get off!
- Bitch.

02:09.240 --> 02:10.651
Yeah.

02:25.160 --> 02:26.446
OK. Now.

02:36.240 --> 02:37.685
Follow them.

02:53.160 --> 02:56.403
Take a left here,
head to the centre of town.

03:12.240 --> 03:13.571
I'm going in.

03:13.800 --> 03:15.131
There's too many people.

03:15.200 --> 03:17.885
They're gonna go upstairs, find there's
no one there and that'll be it.

03:18.680 --> 03:19.727
No.

03:20.160 --> 03:21.400
Give me your fucking gun.

03:27.120 --> 03:28.201
Wait here.

04:18.600 --> 04:19.761
Excuse me, sir.

04:34.400 --> 04:35.731
Move!

05:06.800 --> 05:09.280
Ah!

07:27.120 --> 07:29.487
He never stated his destination?

07:30.840 --> 07:33.571
He gave his driver instructions
as we went along.

07:35.040 --> 07:36.883
He never suspected
who you worked for?

07:39.280 --> 07:40.281
No.

07:40.360 --> 07:41.600
The Semtex?

07:41.680 --> 07:42.681
It was taken.

07:43.920 --> 07:46.571
I placed a tracer in one of the blocks
the night before.

07:46.920 --> 07:49.082
The tracer went offline
when the attack took place.

07:49.160 --> 07:51.481
We're trying to kick-start it
remotely now.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.482
The perpetrators knew
we were gonna be there at that time.

07:57.920 --> 07:59.081
They knew where we were going.

07:59.160 --> 08:00.525
And you didn't stop them?

08:01.160 --> 08:03.481
Perhaps you don't
belong here any more.

08:04.560 --> 08:07.803
So we've no idea to whom
the Semtex was to be delivered?

08:07.960 --> 08:08.961
No.

08:09.280 --> 08:11.806
You and I, Charlotte, in five.

08:17.040 --> 08:20.089
Difficult times.
He's getting pressures from on high.

08:20.680 --> 08:22.330
You did what you could, Ewan.

08:24.240 --> 08:25.651
Charlotte?

08:29.800 --> 08:31.245
Present from my ex-husband.

08:32.480 --> 08:34.687
Get that seen to and get some rest.

09:19.720 --> 09:21.927
On my break.
I've got two minutes left.

09:22.080 --> 09:24.082
No, I'm not smoking.

09:24.520 --> 09:26.443
I'm not inhaling, I'm walking.

09:26.560 --> 09:28.642
I'm out of breath
cos I had to rush back from lunch.

09:29.840 --> 09:33.481
Tuna sandwich.
Tuna sandwich and some crisps,

09:33.560 --> 09:35.722
and a chocolate biscuit
and a coffee, no sugar.

09:35.800 --> 09:38.929
Hey, we gonna go for drinks? Make it...

09:39.000 --> 09:41.162
about quarter past, yeah?

09:42.360 --> 09:45.011
How's Dad? And the fence?

09:46.520 --> 09:47.885
The garden fence.

09:48.080 --> 09:50.321
Just tell him to wait
and I'll help him the next time I'm up

09:50.400 --> 09:54.200
because his back won't hold up.
I'll get time off. It's not a problem.

09:54.720 --> 09:57.200
I don't know when.
I'll let you know when I know.

09:57.280 --> 10:00.921
Hey, one minute.
It's a good job. Gives me time to drink.

10:01.600 --> 10:03.284
Think, I said think!

10:03.520 --> 10:06.364
About whatever. I've got my degree,
I can do what I want.

10:06.440 --> 10:08.761
Look, I've gotta go, I'm late.
Yep, I love you too.

10:08.840 --> 10:09.887
5Ye- Bye, bye, bye.

10:10.600 --> 10:11.761
Sorry.

10:13.320 --> 10:14.526
See ya.

10:14.640 --> 10:16.927
Can I help you, sir? Table for one?

10:31.880 --> 10:33.370
Almost there.

10:34.680 --> 10:36.091
How did you do it?

10:36.680 --> 10:38.045
Slipped.

10:38.360 --> 10:40.283
Doing something strenuous?

10:43.680 --> 10:45.125
Your girlfriend will love the scar.

10:47.320 --> 10:48.765
Sexy.

10:49.880 --> 10:51.006
Wife.

10:52.560 --> 10:54.927
Come back in two days,
take the stitches out.

10:55.480 --> 10:57.050
Might still be here.

10:58.240 --> 10:59.765
Back in a minute with some painkillers.

10:59.840 --> 11:01.080
Yeah.

11:05.640 --> 11:06.971
(Reporter on TV) It's been confirmed

11:07.040 --> 11:10.123
that a suicide bombing
occurred earlier today

11:10.200 --> 11:14.330
at 12:30 in the busy
South London restaurant, Driscoll's.

11:14.400 --> 11:17.210
With currently confirmed casualties
of 20

11:17.280 --> 11:19.567
and with more understood
to be injured.

11:19.640 --> 11:22.450
The restaurant was full
of lunchtime customers,

11:22.560 --> 11:24.369
including a large meeting being held

11:24.440 --> 11:26.568
by the 2004 Committee,

11:26.640 --> 11:29.371
an organization which had
Middle East energy interests

11:29.440 --> 11:32.011
and championed the Iraq war.

11:32.080 --> 11:34.970
Three backbench MPs were members.

11:35.080 --> 11:38.129
All are believed
to be amongst the fatalities.

11:38.760 --> 11:41.889
The same Semtex that was
stolen was used in the bombing.

11:44.960 --> 11:48.089
An element in Whitehall feels that
Obama's inclusive doctrine

11:48.160 --> 11:51.881
has spread across the Atlantic
and has made us complacent.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.321
They're pushing for sweeping changes.

11:56.600 --> 12:00.047
If they discover that the Semtex
was being monitored by us

12:00.120 --> 12:01.963
and that we could have stopped it...

12:03.840 --> 12:06.127
I don't need to tell you
the repercussions for this government,

12:06.200 --> 12:08.089
especially with the election looming.

12:08.160 --> 12:10.401
The clock is ticking on all of us.

12:14.920 --> 12:16.888
It's just you and I here, Charlotte.

12:18.920 --> 12:20.843
What can you do for me?

12:33.600 --> 12:37.810
We are here to remember
Corporal Peter Walcott Tiernan,

12:38.600 --> 12:42.525
taken from us in the service of Queen
and country in Afghanistan.

12:44.160 --> 12:49.451
He bravely answered his country's call,
and leaves a loving wife, Louise,

12:49.520 --> 12:52.330
his brothers, Ian and Daniel,
and his mother, Margaret.

12:52.800 --> 12:57.283
It's at times like these that
we must find strength and peace

12:58.080 --> 13:00.367
in the memories
of what he meant to us,

13:00.440 --> 13:02.727
an honorable son and brother.

13:06.320 --> 13:10.882
He was older than his 25 years
and was the one his family relied upon

13:10.960 --> 13:13.281
since losing their father at an early age.

13:13.760 --> 13:16.809
He undertook his responsibilities
with dignity and strength

13:16.880 --> 13:19.451
and maintained a strong family bond.

13:24.440 --> 13:26.886
Remember he said
he had a trial for United?

13:28.520 --> 13:30.568
He said he missed out
cos he was too fast.

13:32.480 --> 13:33.970
You remember, sir?

13:34.120 --> 13:35.645
Yeah, I remember.

13:36.640 --> 13:38.529
Last letter I got from him, he...

13:39.200 --> 13:41.407
He said the regiment
weren't the same since you left.

13:43.680 --> 13:46.650
- How are you, mate?
- How do I look like I am?

13:48.360 --> 13:50.203
Cold makes it hurt like a bastard.

13:50.360 --> 13:52.283
I can't sleep properly.

13:53.120 --> 13:54.724
What happened there?

13:55.600 --> 13:57.523
Ah, some stupid accident.

13:59.760 --> 14:01.444
- Is that your wife?
- Yeah.

14:01.880 --> 14:03.484
Thinks I'm some sort of invalid.

14:03.560 --> 14:04.971
She can't stop fussing.

14:05.520 --> 14:06.851
You should be thankful.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.842
See that bomb they set off in London?

14:10.360 --> 14:14.081
It was on the news.
It never ends. None of it.

14:14.160 --> 14:16.128
What was the point of Pete dying, sir?

14:16.480 --> 14:18.482
Dying in some shithole country
for nothing.

14:18.560 --> 14:21.404
- What was the fucking point?
- What's the matter with you?

14:21.480 --> 14:24.563
Have some respect for him,
for his family.

14:25.080 --> 14:29.449
You got hurt, but you're here.
You're alive.

14:33.840 --> 14:35.569
Listen to me,

14:36.360 --> 14:38.044
we move on.

14:38.560 --> 14:41.689
What's here and now,
that's all that matters, all right?

14:43.320 --> 14:45.129
Go back to your wife.

14:50.200 --> 14:51.850
If you need help,

14:52.320 --> 14:53.765
you can always find me.

14:54.520 --> 14:57.251
We stick together, all of us.

14:57.320 --> 15:00.529
Have you moved on, sir?
From what happened?

15:23.760 --> 15:24.966
Hello?

15:25.040 --> 15:27.281
(Charlotte) A car will be downstairs
in 15 minutes.

15:35.920 --> 15:37.001
I'm Mark.

15:52.560 --> 15:54.050
Baby daughter.

16:25.680 --> 16:29.048
Take the path through the wood.
You'll find her at the other end.

16:31.240 --> 16:32.526
Bit of a walk.

16:34.320 --> 16:37.085
You've seen the news.
20 dead, scores injured.

16:37.960 --> 16:40.691
Semtex was used. You understand?

16:44.640 --> 16:46.483
Perpetrator?

16:46.560 --> 16:48.847
It was strapped to his jacket,
self-detonated.

16:48.920 --> 16:53.721
No details on who he was.
CCTV have no clear images.

16:54.320 --> 16:55.731
There's nothing left of him.

16:55.800 --> 16:57.564
We're bound by procedure.

16:57.880 --> 17:00.360
In this situation,
we cannot afford those constraints.

17:00.440 --> 17:03.683
This is off-reservation.
It's why you're at my home.

17:03.800 --> 17:06.007
I want you to find who's responsible

17:06.079 --> 17:08.890
and stop him
in whatever way you feel fit.

17:08.960 --> 17:10.644
Let it be done quickly.

17:11.920 --> 17:14.605
It'll be you and Mark.
He's young but capable.

17:14.680 --> 17:16.284
Very good with a gun, I hear.

17:16.359 --> 17:19.170
I want it low-tech, old trade craft.

17:20.040 --> 17:22.122
If you get caught,
I don't want evidence.

17:22.319 --> 17:25.130
I'll supply technical backup
and the sweep and clean.

17:25.359 --> 17:29.251
No luck yet with the tracer
you planted in the Semtex

17:29.320 --> 17:32.210
but we did find something curious
of your man Harry.

17:33.160 --> 17:36.130
No bullets in his automatic.
Any thoughts?

17:37.960 --> 17:39.371
Maybe.

17:40.560 --> 17:43.882
You're my hands on this, Ewan,
my conscience.

17:45.640 --> 17:46.721
Wipe it clean.

17:48.280 --> 17:49.725
No loose ends.

18:21.840 --> 18:23.410
Where's Harry?

18:24.000 --> 18:26.207
Fat cheapskate owes me money.

18:28.800 --> 18:30.211
Harry's dead.

18:32.840 --> 18:36.208
I want you to think carefully,
more carefully than you've ever thought.

18:36.280 --> 18:37.645
Was there anything...

18:39.000 --> 18:41.321
Anything unusual happened
in the last few days?

18:41.760 --> 18:45.481
Anything you know
but you're not telling me?

18:45.920 --> 18:47.922
Dead? What are you talking about?

18:55.840 --> 18:56.966
I'm leaving.

18:59.480 --> 19:01.687
You took the bullets from his gun.
Why?

19:01.840 --> 19:03.763
I don't know what you're talking about.

19:09.760 --> 19:12.604
I don't have time to waste.

19:12.680 --> 19:15.251
I know you know something
and I'm not leaving until you talk,

19:15.320 --> 19:18.005
- one way or another.

19:25.600 --> 19:26.726
Talk.

19:26.800 --> 19:29.041
I don't know anything. Please.

19:31.440 --> 19:33.761
By the time I'm through with your face,

19:33.840 --> 19:36.923
nobody's going to wanna look at you,
let alone pay to fuck you.

19:37.880 --> 19:39.769
He said nothing would happen.

19:40.840 --> 19:41.966
What?

19:42.040 --> 19:44.168
- He told me it was just business.
- Who did?

19:44.240 --> 19:47.050
- A client.
- Which client? Tell me about him.

19:47.120 --> 19:49.327
- Young guy, said his name was Paul.
- Paul?

19:49.400 --> 19:52.768
I saw him regular for two months.
He wanted to know stuff about Harry.

19:52.840 --> 19:55.127
- What stuff?
- What he was up to, his routine,

19:55.280 --> 19:56.930
he paid me extra.

19:57.000 --> 20:01.005
I told him useless stuff-
who he met, what time, his routine,

20:01.080 --> 20:03.401
- just useless stuff.
- What about the bullets?

20:03.480 --> 20:05.164
Said it was a joke to take them out.

20:05.240 --> 20:07.527
Said Harry showed up with a gun.
He wanted to teach him a lesson.

20:07.600 --> 20:09.364
Where did you meet him?
What did he look like?

20:09.440 --> 20:11.408
At his house. Expensive place.

20:11.480 --> 20:14.802
Short hair, brown, slim,
could pass for Greek or Italian

20:14.880 --> 20:15.847
but he was an Arab.

20:15.920 --> 20:17.570
- How do you know?
- I have Arab friends.

20:17.640 --> 20:20.564
I know what the language sounds like.
Heard him speaking it on the phone.

20:20.640 --> 20:22.449
You know his address?

20:31.840 --> 20:35.162
When the bomb went off,
there was a flash,

20:35.240 --> 20:37.049
and then there was lots of smoke.

20:37.120 --> 20:40.567
A lot of glass flying. There was
a lot of people on the ground.

20:40.640 --> 20:43.007
Horrendous, huge explosion...

20:43.840 --> 20:46.207
I don't know.
I just felt it more than anything else.

20:52.320 --> 20:53.731
Ash.

20:57.080 --> 20:58.605
Jesus.

20:59.080 --> 21:00.491
How have you been?

21:00.560 --> 21:03.211
Good, yeah. You?

21:03.800 --> 21:05.370
Yeah, I'm good.

21:05.720 --> 21:07.643
Do you, uh, live around here?

21:07.720 --> 21:10.041
No, I'm just... Coffee.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.604
It's good to see you.

21:13.040 --> 21:14.530
Yeah, you too.

21:17.200 --> 21:19.487
I have to go. I'm late for something.

21:19.920 --> 21:22.571
Listen, um... Do you have a number?

21:24.200 --> 21:26.680
If you... If you give me yours, I can...

21:27.560 --> 21:30.006
- If I can get this thing to work.
- It's all right, give me yours.

21:30.080 --> 21:31.366
I'll tap into this.

21:31.440 --> 21:34.364
Um... OK.

21:34.600 --> 21:36.602
07950...

21:38.880 --> 21:40.723
956958.

21:42.440 --> 21:44.408
- Got it.

21:46.640 --> 21:49.325
Look, I have to go.
I'm really late for something, but...

21:50.120 --> 21:51.406
Really nice to see you again.

21:54.240 --> 21:56.846
(Man on TV) Horrific.
What we saw was devastation.

21:56.920 --> 21:59.400
It was just horrific, really.
It was like being in a war zone.

21:59.480 --> 22:01.130
It was crazy and I heard screams.

22:01.200 --> 22:04.124
People like, kind of injured,
and their clothes were all, like...

22:04.200 --> 22:05.531
Everyone was just covered in dust.

22:05.600 --> 22:08.046
(Woman on radio) We have with us
today Crispin Jones,

22:08.120 --> 22:09.610
who is an intelligence expert.

22:09.680 --> 22:12.889
Crispin, what are your thoughts
about the recent spate of bombings?

22:12.960 --> 22:15.964
(Crispin) Well, I think it's too early
for us to speculate

22:16.040 --> 22:17.963
as to who's involved, but, um,

22:18.040 --> 22:19.963
the hallmarks of the bombing
really do point

22:20.040 --> 22:22.202
to home-grown Islamic terrorism.

22:22.320 --> 22:25.085
Cowardly way the bombs were lit
in a public place,

22:25.680 --> 22:28.365
nature of the types of explosives,
and it seems to be...

22:34.680 --> 22:36.170
Off you 9°

23:12.880 --> 23:14.086
Hi.

23:24.080 --> 23:25.889
Can I use your bathroom?

23:27.400 --> 23:28.845
Yeah, you know where it is.

24:34.560 --> 24:36.449
So why are you here?

24:37.480 --> 24:40.689
You always said if I needed any help
I could speak to you.

24:43.400 --> 24:44.970
I need money.

25:01.880 --> 25:03.928
Can I get a drink?

25:06.600 --> 25:08.011
Yeah, sure.

25:41.320 --> 25:42.606
Get your fucking hands up!

25:42.680 --> 25:44.125
- You got me into this!
- Fucking whore!

25:44.200 --> 25:45.611
- Get your hands up!
- Fucking bitch!

25:45.680 --> 25:47.648
- Get away from him!
- You got me into this!

26:04.160 --> 26:05.571
Check outside.

28:10.080 --> 28:12.686
- Hello?
-  Why'd you hang up?

28:13.600 --> 28:15.648
Yeah, I didn't know what to say.

28:15.760 --> 28:18.684
Why didn't you move your lips
and something would have come out.

28:20.960 --> 28:23.167
Listen, are you free to meet?

28:25.320 --> 28:27.561
(Man on radio) It's a bright,
sunny morning in London town,

28:27.640 --> 28:29.369
with highs in the early 20$...

28:31.000 --> 28:34.447
Coming up, lots of new music
and a few other surprises in store!

28:34.520 --> 28:36.727
It's nine minutes past eight...

28:52.480 --> 28:55.484
Time for some music.

28:56.600 --> 28:59.729
It's Blur, from their last album,
Think Tank.

29:05.640 --> 29:07.210
I love this song.

29:07.400 --> 29:10.609
Oh, God, it's gonna stay in my head
for the whole day now.

29:15.520 --> 29:17.204
Shooting star?

29:17.480 --> 29:20.211
It's going out in beautiful flames.

29:31.320 --> 29:34.722
You remember I said
that I was late a couple of weeks ago?

29:36.840 --> 29:37.966
Yeah.

29:38.040 --> 29:40.281
Well, I came on the other day.

29:41.960 --> 29:43.724
Aren't you relieved?

29:46.120 --> 29:47.770
I'm disappointed, actually.

29:52.200 --> 29:56.410
I mean, obviously, that kid would have
my good looks and massive brain.

29:56.480 --> 29:59.245
When do I get to
meet your mum?

29:59.960 --> 30:02.611
Well, you'd have to put
some clothes on first.

30:02.680 --> 30:04.762
You haven't told her
about me, have you?

30:05.520 --> 30:08.444
Is it cos I'm not a nice Muslim girl?

30:09.200 --> 30:10.326
She doesn't know

30:10.400 --> 30:14.246
that you're a bacon-eating,
lager-drinking sex maniac?

30:17.400 --> 30:19.607
John Major signed a peace treaty
with Sinn Féin

30:19.680 --> 30:22.081
because the IRA's violent actions
forced him to.

30:22.400 --> 30:25.802
Gerry Adams changed from a terrorist
to a politician but it was violence

30:25.880 --> 30:29.009
and legal action that forced the change.
Not one lawyer was involved.

30:29.080 --> 30:31.811
Gerry Adams is a murderer.

30:31.880 --> 30:35.043
This is a law class.
It's not a political forum for you to...

30:35.120 --> 30:37.361
Actually, in today's context
he is recognised and accepted.

30:37.440 --> 30:40.410
He's being invited to have tea
with the Prime Minister, for fuck's sake.

30:41.640 --> 30:43.722
Ash, just keep it civilized.

30:44.280 --> 30:45.520
I'm sorry.

30:46.520 --> 30:48.727
Cos he matched them with violence.

30:49.080 --> 30:51.845
I mean, look at Israel,
created through a violent struggle

30:51.920 --> 30:54.571
and now it's an internationally
recognised state.

30:54.640 --> 30:56.642
In America, the American forefathers
fought the British,

30:56.720 --> 30:58.643
beat them hands down,
and now what are they?

30:58.720 --> 31:00.290
They're the biggest
superpower on this planet.

31:00.360 --> 31:02.966
Why? Because violence
is the supreme authority

31:03.040 --> 31:06.010
all authorities derive
their power and legitimacy from.

31:06.600 --> 31:10.446
Law is completely irrelevant
in the face of true force.

31:11.680 --> 31:13.364
That applies to any country.

31:14.440 --> 31:16.522
And what's your country?

31:20.880 --> 31:22.041
Ash.

31:22.640 --> 31:24.529
Can I have a word?

31:28.440 --> 31:31.330
You may be smart
but you are close to failing.

31:31.840 --> 31:33.604
It's a I'm afraid.

31:35.880 --> 31:37.086
I can handle this.

31:37.160 --> 31:39.288
Ash, do you really want
to practice law?

31:40.280 --> 31:43.204
- Ash?
- Don't worry.

31:52.880 --> 31:54.325
"All right, I'm coming out.

31:54.400 --> 31:56.482
"You, coming out now.

31:58.160 --> 32:00.208
"Any man I see outside
I'm going to shoot.

32:00.280 --> 32:02.248
"Any son of a bitch
who starts to shoot at me,

32:02.320 --> 32:04.288
"I'm going to shoot them, too.

32:04.360 --> 32:06.761
"Then I'm going to kill
all his friends, his family,

32:07.040 --> 32:09.486
"and then second generation,
everybody.

32:09.960 --> 32:11.689
"Then I'm going
to burn their house down."

32:11.760 --> 32:14.001
It's Unforgiven, you know?

32:14.080 --> 32:17.368
Clint Eastwood after he's killed
everyone for murdering his friend,

32:17.440 --> 32:21.923
played by the noble Morgan Freeman.
Oh, man, great actor.

32:25.800 --> 32:27.404
I'm Nabil. You are?

32:27.760 --> 32:29.922
- I'm Ash.
- Ah, Ash.

32:30.160 --> 32:31.844
Like cigarette ash. (Chuckling)

32:33.840 --> 32:36.320
It's not your real name, huh?

32:36.520 --> 32:39.410
Don't be ashamed of who you are, huh?

32:40.480 --> 32:42.209
Short for Ashraf, yes?

32:44.280 --> 32:46.886
You look how
they've killed Muslims, huh,

32:47.000 --> 32:48.809
- in Bosnia, Chechnya, Kosovo.

32:48.920 --> 32:51.321
And now they've invaded Iraq
for the bloody oil.

32:52.480 --> 32:54.323
Come to one of my meetings.

32:54.400 --> 32:57.085
Here, take... Take, uh...
Take some of these, yeah?

32:57.160 --> 33:00.050
Take five, you give them
to your friends.

33:01.480 --> 33:03.289
You have friends, don't you?

33:06.760 --> 33:08.489
Your face!

33:15.480 --> 33:16.720
Hey!

33:17.840 --> 33:20.207
Oh, Allah wouldn't be pleased!

33:21.000 --> 33:22.650
Sorry, what did you say?

33:24.600 --> 33:27.001
- What were you guys doing in there?
- Just a little pick-me-up.

33:27.080 --> 33:28.366
Were you doing that shit with him?

33:28.440 --> 33:30.363
Ash, don't start. I'm not in the mood.

33:42.560 --> 33:43.686
Come on, come on.

33:49.600 --> 33:50.601
'  Oh!
- C)I"'l!

33:52.360 --> 33:53.441
You all right?

33:53.520 --> 33:54.726
- Let's go.
- Hey, hey, hey.

33:54.800 --> 33:56.564
- Get the fuck off me!
- Easy!

33:56.640 --> 33:58.130
Get off me! God.

34:02.920 --> 34:04.331
Come here.

34:08.320 --> 34:09.481
Ash, I'm sorry.

34:09.560 --> 34:11.005
What the fuck's
the matter with you, huh?

34:11.080 --> 34:12.320
Trying to make me
look like a fucking idiot?

34:12.400 --> 34:13.889
- No.
- Doing that shit with him, huh?

34:13.960 --> 34:14.960
That fucking prick.

34:15.040 --> 34:16.565
What were you doing
in the fucking toilets, huh?

34:16.639 --> 34:17.801
- Nothing.
- Sucking his cock?

34:17.880 --> 34:19.166
- I'm sorry.
- Was he feeling...

34:19.239 --> 34:20.764
- Fuck off!
- Come on, Ash.

34:20.840 --> 34:22.524
Just as long as you have
a fucking great time,

34:22.600 --> 34:23.840
you know, fucking get wasted.

34:23.920 --> 34:25.251
You don't give a shit about anything,
do you?

34:25.320 --> 34:26.685
- You don't care about anything.
- Look, I'm sorry.

34:26.760 --> 34:28.250
Listen, look, I'm sorry, OK?

34:29.320 --> 34:30.650
I'm sorry.

34:30.800 --> 34:33.007
I promise I won't do it again.

34:33.080 --> 34:34.969
This is the last time, OK?

34:36.120 --> 34:37.281
You know I love you.

34:37.360 --> 34:41.524
We must rise up against
these Western pigs

34:41.840 --> 34:44.047
who occupy our lands.

34:45.080 --> 34:49.210
Who come at us with smiles
to take what's ours

34:50.040 --> 34:52.850
and turn us against each other.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.047
In this so-called democracy,

34:55.639 --> 34:58.962
if you speak up about
Muslims being slaughtered,

34:59.880 --> 35:03.327
you're an extremist. Huh? Yes?

35:03.400 --> 35:05.129
Yes, yes.

35:05.560 --> 35:12.250
But if you are passive, huh?
Silent, easy to control, huh?

35:12.800 --> 35:16.088
You're a good Muslim. Yes?

35:16.160 --> 35:19.482
Just like a dog, they throw you a bone.

35:20.440 --> 35:22.408
But keep you on a leash, ah?

35:22.480 --> 35:25.324
You know the type of Muslim
I'm talking about.

35:25.400 --> 35:27.801
He's so ashamed of who he is.

35:29.320 --> 35:31.641
He gives himself a Western name.

35:32.160 --> 35:36.643
He tries to think and feel
like his Western master.

35:36.720 --> 35:38.529
Live like him, be him!

35:38.600 --> 35:40.170
You say to him...

35:41.080 --> 35:43.811
My friend, you say to him,

35:44.760 --> 35:47.366
"Let's stop the murder of Muslims."

35:47.520 --> 35:51.286
And he would say,
"You ignorant foreigner,

35:51.360 --> 35:56.810
"you want me to jeopardize
my nice life and my country, huh?"

35:56.920 --> 36:01.244
This is the fool who wears
an England football shirt,

36:01.760 --> 36:04.809
and says,
"Ah, we won the match." Huh?

36:05.400 --> 36:08.563
And the man next to him,
in the same shirt,

36:09.280 --> 36:11.442
he calls him a Paki, hmm?

36:12.520 --> 36:13.931
A nigger.

36:14.000 --> 36:18.005
Ask yourself, "Who are you?"

36:19.400 --> 36:20.401
Really?

36:32.520 --> 36:34.045
All right, matey?

36:35.080 --> 36:37.128
I'll just get a couple of pints, please.

36:40.240 --> 36:41.366
How's Kate?

36:44.240 --> 36:47.449
She was off her head last night.
I've never seen anyone drink

36:47.520 --> 36:51.570
or snort as much as that in my life.
An animal.

36:52.160 --> 36:53.969
So how come you weren't there?

36:54.080 --> 36:55.525
She not tell you she was out?

36:56.280 --> 36:58.487
I wanted her to suck me off
but she passed out.

37:15.800 --> 37:17.643
It's OK, hey, no problem.

37:18.320 --> 37:20.641
It's all right, my friend,
it's no problem, no problem.

37:20.760 --> 37:22.728
Come, come, move, come.

37:22.800 --> 37:25.724
It's all right, it's all right, a racist.
Bastard. Come on.

37:30.960 --> 37:32.962
You know, it felt good, what I did.

37:34.240 --> 37:37.369
You know, sometimes to earn respect,

37:37.960 --> 37:40.122
we have to do things
we wouldn't normally do.

37:40.200 --> 37:43.204
You know, people like us
have to do that

37:43.560 --> 37:46.962
just to get the basic respect
most people take for granted.

37:48.400 --> 37:49.925
In Afghanistan, hmm,

37:51.320 --> 37:56.281
we had to fight to earn respect
and freedom from the Russians.

37:57.320 --> 37:58.970
You were there?

37:59.200 --> 38:00.929
What was it like?

38:01.000 --> 38:04.004
What happens on the battlefield
is between you and God.

38:04.960 --> 38:06.450
I am here now.

38:06.520 --> 38:10.605
God didn't will it for me
to enter paradise.

38:12.440 --> 38:17.685
But I'm content, you know?
Contentment is a state of mind.

38:18.440 --> 38:20.124
Like Palestine.

38:20.840 --> 38:23.047
You know, law is not for me.

38:24.360 --> 38:26.681
I don't want to be part of any hypocrisy.

38:31.880 --> 38:33.450
Look.

38:38.720 --> 38:41.929
Would you call them
dignified human beings, hmm?

38:42.280 --> 38:43.850
They're just having fun.

38:44.080 --> 38:48.563
My friend, no, we are not like them.

39:17.320 --> 39:18.367
What time is it?

39:18.440 --> 39:20.010
You have a rough night?

39:23.320 --> 39:24.845
My head.

39:31.600 --> 39:32.681
Listen, Kate.

39:34.720 --> 39:36.643
I don't think we should
see each other any more.

39:39.720 --> 39:40.960
Why?

39:41.120 --> 39:42.849
Same shit every day.

39:44.720 --> 39:46.802
You don't know when to stop.

39:46.880 --> 39:48.882
I'm 23, for God's sake.

39:50.360 --> 39:53.204
Look, I'll stop when I'm older.
I'm enjoying myself.

39:53.640 --> 39:55.404
Will you just relax, for Christ's sake?

39:55.480 --> 39:58.768
Right, I don't want to see you
any more. OK?

40:00.640 --> 40:02.688
I don't want this any more.

40:03.080 --> 40:04.684
You can go back to sleep if you like.

40:04.760 --> 40:05.886
Oh, what, just like that?

40:07.560 --> 40:11.246
Black and white?
It's so fucking easy for you, isn't it?

40:13.520 --> 40:15.807
You want to end it with me and...

40:16.560 --> 40:18.642
you end it, just like it's nothing.

40:20.520 --> 40:22.409
You want to leave? Just go.

40:31.440 --> 40:33.010
Get over yourself.

40:33.160 --> 40:34.366
Ash!

41:05.400 --> 41:07.482
(Reporter) The terror level
stays at "critical"

41:07.560 --> 41:10.643
and some are calling London
a city under siege.

41:10.720 --> 41:11.960
The government announced today

41:12.040 --> 41:14.407
that it would proceed as planned
with the general election.

41:14.480 --> 41:17.211
We ask whether it would be best
to postpone the election

41:17.280 --> 41:18.645
in the interests of public safety.

41:18.720 --> 41:20.245
The government, however, may feel

41:20.320 --> 41:24.166
that an alteration to the election date
would be seen as a victory for...

41:30.480 --> 41:31.925
Nice place.

41:35.400 --> 41:36.686
Swish.

41:57.080 --> 41:58.923
Present for my baby daughter.

42:00.040 --> 42:02.168
You have to check for small parts.

42:06.560 --> 42:08.005
Ever wondered why they do it?

42:11.120 --> 42:13.771
Too simplistic to think
they just hate us?

42:15.640 --> 42:17.881
What does that have to do
with this girl?

42:20.160 --> 42:21.571
Look at her.

42:25.080 --> 42:26.491
Have you served for your country?

42:27.120 --> 42:28.610
No.

42:29.720 --> 42:32.371
I fought over there.

42:32.840 --> 42:35.889
To stop this from happening here.
Again.

42:37.440 --> 42:40.569
Didn't stop. They're not going to stop.

42:41.640 --> 42:43.324
And neither will I.

42:45.080 --> 42:46.923
I'm going to find every one of them...

42:48.000 --> 42:50.446
and send them to the death
they pray for.

42:57.240 --> 42:58.366
Hello?

42:58.440 --> 43:01.125
There's a file for you
at the drop box in 10 minutes.

43:01.840 --> 43:03.046
Come on.

43:43.080 --> 43:45.731
You hesitated before
you gave the safe signal.

43:48.280 --> 43:49.611
Is someone following you?

43:49.720 --> 43:50.960
Maybe.

43:52.920 --> 43:53.921
I couldn't say.

43:54.000 --> 43:56.970
Did you walk here?
Circuits?

43:57.040 --> 43:59.884
I've been down Holborn,
Chancery Lane, Oxford Street.

44:00.920 --> 44:02.888
- Two hours.
- Shall I report it?

44:03.960 --> 44:05.166
I'm not sure.

44:05.480 --> 44:07.562
Bombings are making us all nervous.

44:07.960 --> 44:09.405
Don't worry about it.

44:17.200 --> 44:20.124
They found the receipt in Paul's house
for two pay-as-you-go phones.

44:20.200 --> 44:22.771
Paul had one. The other was used
two hours ago from that building.

44:23.760 --> 44:25.888
The phone was used
to call Afghanistan.

44:26.080 --> 44:27.491
He's in there on his own.

44:28.640 --> 44:31.530
It's not registered to anyone.
It's an abandoned council property.

44:31.600 --> 44:33.090
We can go in round the back.

44:33.160 --> 44:35.811
We go in and take him.
Shots to the head.

44:36.720 --> 44:39.326
Anything else allows him to detonate,
understood?

44:39.560 --> 44:40.561
Yeah.

45:03.400 --> 45:04.606
Come on.

45:32.040 --> 45:34.122
- Get up!
- Ah! No!

45:34.200 --> 45:35.884
Don't! Stop! No!

45:35.960 --> 45:38.247
Where's your jacket, hey?

45:38.320 --> 45:39.731
- I said don't shoot!
- Face the wall!

45:39.800 --> 45:41.404
I said face the fucking wall!

45:41.480 --> 45:43.926
- Face the fucking wall!
- I said don't shoot!

45:44.280 --> 45:46.806
Close the door. Go!

45:51.320 --> 45:52.685
Let me just talk to you, man.

45:52.760 --> 45:54.444
I said let me talk to you!

45:54.520 --> 45:55.931
How many people were you gonna kill?

45:56.000 --> 45:57.525
Just give me a second, please.

45:57.600 --> 45:59.364
Get on your fucking knees!

45:59.440 --> 46:01.727
I don't know what
you're talking about, all right?

46:01.800 --> 46:03.802
- How many?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

46:03.880 --> 46:07.646
Just listen to me and calm down,
and me and you can...

46:09.440 --> 46:11.568
An eye for an eye, yeah?

46:17.800 --> 46:19.564
I'm just like you.

46:19.960 --> 46:21.041
I'm just...

46:21.480 --> 46:23.005
I'm just like you, all right?

46:23.080 --> 46:25.606
You're nothing like me,
you fucking animal.

46:25.760 --> 46:27.046
Please, don't!

46:27.120 --> 46:28.326
I can do what I want to you.

46:28.400 --> 46:29.811
I can do anything I want.

46:29.880 --> 46:30.881
You know that?

46:31.400 --> 46:32.845
Please don't!

46:47.480 --> 46:48.720
Move!

46:59.680 --> 47:00.920
Let him burn.

47:20.360 --> 47:22.249
Oh, fucking hell.

47:29.680 --> 47:31.808
The tracer on the Semtex
was kick-started.

47:31.880 --> 47:33.086
This will take you right to it.

47:35.160 --> 47:37.367
Who was the man I just killed?

47:38.240 --> 47:40.004
You have to go now.

47:47.200 --> 47:52.161
Mujeeb Ajmed. Pakistani parents,
23 years old, UK citizen.

47:53.000 --> 47:56.607
At the precise moment
he was signing on, squatting in the flat.

47:57.600 --> 47:59.443
Not a bomber.

48:02.280 --> 48:04.362
What other options
were you faced with?

48:18.040 --> 48:20.850
Considering the past days' events,
your past...

48:22.240 --> 48:26.325
what you've been through,
what we've all been through.

48:28.040 --> 48:29.849
You were not there.

48:29.960 --> 48:34.807
We have removed all traces of you.
It was a squat in a dealer's hangout.

48:34.880 --> 48:36.291
What's done is done.

48:38.240 --> 48:39.651
How did he get the phone?

48:39.760 --> 48:42.001
Stolen, obviously, from Paul.

48:42.080 --> 48:44.845
Do you have anything
that would link you with this incident?

48:45.360 --> 48:46.486
Just his jacket.

48:47.680 --> 48:49.170
Get rid of it.

48:51.920 --> 48:53.843
This is no time to doubt.

48:54.760 --> 48:56.808
Innocent lives are at stake.

48:58.280 --> 48:59.281
Finish it.

49:03.840 --> 49:05.330
Do you remember Ian?

49:05.400 --> 49:07.971
The stoner who used to steal
our milk and top it up with water.

49:08.040 --> 49:09.883
Oh yeah, he used to piss
into a water bottle

49:09.960 --> 49:11.564
cos he couldn't be bothered
to walk to the toilet.

49:11.640 --> 49:14.325
Yeah, I saw three
full bottles in there once.

49:15.800 --> 49:18.167
So what have you been up to
all this time?

49:18.240 --> 49:20.208
Oh, nothing much, just been drifting.

49:20.280 --> 49:21.611
You didn't get into law?

49:21.680 --> 49:23.125
No, it wasn't for me.

49:23.200 --> 49:25.248
I always thought you were
gonna be a high flyer.

49:25.320 --> 49:26.651
Have your own firm.

49:26.720 --> 49:29.883
Not like me. I always knew I'd end up
working in the dullest law practice ever.

49:30.160 --> 49:31.571
Why don't you just quit?

49:33.040 --> 49:35.042
- It's not that easy. I can't just...
- No.

49:35.120 --> 49:37.122
- ...leave my job.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

49:37.200 --> 49:40.170
So are you, um...
Are you married or anything?

49:40.440 --> 49:42.807
No, not married.

49:43.440 --> 49:45.249
Relationships, yeah.

49:46.280 --> 49:48.965
There was this one guy
but that just ended.

49:50.240 --> 49:51.366
No, I loved him.

49:52.480 --> 49:56.644
He just wasn't interested.
Wasted four years of my life.

49:56.720 --> 49:58.688
Lost it a bit, actually.

49:59.600 --> 50:02.331
Still managed to keep my job
at the law firm.

50:03.160 --> 50:05.322
And then I went crazy wanting kids.

50:06.280 --> 50:07.964
Never met anyone.

50:09.400 --> 50:10.401
You?

50:11.120 --> 50:12.770
Nothing serious.

50:13.200 --> 50:14.884
How's your mum?

50:15.360 --> 50:18.330
Is she still trying to get you
to marry a nice Muslim girl?

50:18.400 --> 50:21.131
No. She, um... She died
a couple of years ago.

50:22.600 --> 50:24.364
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

50:26.240 --> 50:27.844
You look beautiful.

50:30.760 --> 50:32.888
I hardly ever think about those days.

50:33.440 --> 50:35.727
Uni feels like another life to me.

50:40.880 --> 50:42.211
What you doing?

50:56.560 --> 50:59.484
We, uh, we organise activities
for young Muslims.

50:59.600 --> 51:03.764
Camping in the Brecon Beacons,
rafting, paintball, team bonding.

51:03.840 --> 51:05.604
(Ash) And we combine these
with religious teachings.

51:05.680 --> 51:08.968
Now, as a successful Muslim
businessman, you want your staff...

51:09.040 --> 51:11.441
- Your Muslim staff.
- ...to be of good character, right?

51:13.120 --> 51:16.203
Thank you for coming to visit me
and for making this offer,

51:16.280 --> 51:17.611
but I'll have to pass.

51:18.200 --> 51:21.329
I don't involve myself
in my workers' private lives.

51:21.400 --> 51:26.008
I'm not a religious man,
but faith is a...a personal thing.

51:27.040 --> 51:29.088
What they do in their own time
is their business,

51:29.160 --> 51:31.322
and that's what's great
about this country.

51:31.840 --> 51:33.285
But thank you.

51:33.400 --> 51:35.050
Great about this country?

51:35.120 --> 51:37.930
Man, this is the same country
that has destroyed so many cultures.

51:38.000 --> 51:39.843
All our cultures.

51:40.640 --> 51:43.450
- Thanks for your time.
- No problem, thank you.

51:47.360 --> 51:48.361
(Dog barking)

51:56.560 --> 51:58.483
Oh, Muhammed.

51:58.560 --> 52:01.131
(Laughs) Hey, you look well.

52:01.200 --> 52:02.884
Salam aleikum.

52:03.880 --> 52:06.804
Yeah, how are you?
Good to see you, my friend.

52:08.360 --> 52:10.089
Oi!  Hamed!

52:10.840 --> 52:14.049
Don't shoot me! I'm only...
Hey, good to see you.

52:16.920 --> 52:19.127
How are you?
Good to see you, good to see you.

52:19.200 --> 52:20.361
- Salam aleikum.
- Yussif, yes?

52:20.440 --> 52:22.204
- Yes, yes.
- Which one is this?

52:22.320 --> 52:24.368
This is the one we send to the boys,
but it's the truth.

52:24.440 --> 52:26.124
You're doing excellent work, very good.

52:26.200 --> 52:27.361
- Thanks.
- Now come, we need to talk, huh?

52:27.440 --> 52:28.566
- Yep.
- Shall I come with you, bruv?

52:28.640 --> 52:30.369
No, just, uh, finish up.

52:36.080 --> 52:37.411
He wasn't interested.

52:38.360 --> 52:40.010
No problem. Ah, there...

52:40.080 --> 52:42.811
There are other business people
we can approach, you know?

52:42.880 --> 52:47.886
It's a matter of, uh, getting their
young workers to join us, huh? Huh?

52:48.400 --> 52:50.801
You know,
this gym was a very good idea.

52:50.880 --> 52:54.089
You're doing very, very well, my friend.
Very, very well.

52:57.120 --> 52:59.168
You want to do more, yes?

52:59.640 --> 53:01.165
What have you got in mind?

53:01.240 --> 53:03.766
A test of your will.

53:04.280 --> 53:05.930
And then we shall see about you.

53:06.800 --> 53:08.928
This is Sergeant Glenn Conlon.

53:09.000 --> 53:12.083
Ex-military with
intelligence associations.

53:12.160 --> 53:14.925
He has served in secret prisons
all over the Middle East,

53:15.000 --> 53:18.891
killing and torturing people we know,
you know, people close to us.

53:19.840 --> 53:22.127
He's not in the services any more,
you know, he's...

53:23.040 --> 53:24.485
bought a farm.

53:24.560 --> 53:27.325
Stables, you know,
he wants the quiet life.

53:27.840 --> 53:30.684
He's retired from killing
and humiliating Muslims.

53:32.120 --> 53:33.360
We don't retire.

53:34.320 --> 53:35.321
We don't forget.

53:36.360 --> 53:39.523
There is a man coming from the
Middle East. An important man.

53:39.600 --> 53:42.126
He lands next week.
You'll go and meet him.

53:42.560 --> 53:45.245
You'll do as he asks.
But he needs your assistance.

53:45.640 --> 53:47.290
This is a foreign country to him.

53:50.480 --> 53:52.005
You'll need another man.

53:52.920 --> 53:53.967
You have someone?

53:54.040 --> 53:55.963
 Yeah, Yussif.
Good.

53:57.120 --> 54:00.602
You're going to help
our friend with Sergeant Conlon.

54:13.760 --> 54:15.125
Ash raf?

54:33.920 --> 54:35.365
Peaceful streets.

55:07.560 --> 55:08.925
lngleezee.

55:10.120 --> 55:11.326
What?

55:15.120 --> 55:16.610
Englishman.

56:00.320 --> 56:02.687
He gets up at 8:00AM,
goes to the barn,

56:02.760 --> 56:05.366
cleans it for an hour
and then goes to the stables.

56:05.440 --> 56:06.601
Who lives with him?

56:06.720 --> 56:08.404
- Nobody.
- No wife?

56:08.920 --> 56:09.921
No.

56:11.400 --> 56:14.006
When he comes out of his house,
follow him into the barn.

56:14.520 --> 56:15.726
Show him the gun.

56:16.880 --> 56:20.362
We come out, we beat him,
tie him, take him.

56:21.040 --> 56:23.646
You do everything like I tell you to,
you understand?

56:26.080 --> 56:27.889
A knife for you.

56:30.280 --> 56:31.486
No fork.

58:16.800 --> 58:18.325
Go and see what is happening.

01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:44.245
I'm going to cut
your head off like a pig's.

01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:05.802
- Anyone else here?
- No one.

01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:12.328
Put him in the van.
Put your dead friend there, too.

01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:25.291
Turn the camera on.

01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:52.963
(Man on radio)
Some breaking news for you now.

01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:56.044
A Mr Glenn Conlon
has been reported missing.

01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:59.602
Mr Conlon was a banker and
a former private in the Army Reserves.

01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:02.289
His sister, Rebecca Conlon,

01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:05.728
and her 8-month-old daughter
were found brutally murdered

01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:07.763
at his farm in Hertfordshire.

01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:09.842
The police have little to go on...

01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:21.644
There is anger in you.

01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:24.965
Makes no sense.

01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:28.004
Why are you helping us?

01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:43.366
You're angry with me about
the woman, the baby.

01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:48.688
Do you think he cared for the families
of the men he tortured and killed?

01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:56.330
You're confused in the head. Majnoon.

01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:02.200
Take it.

01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:18.241
These pigs kill our people

01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:22.928
all over the world
and you feel for them?

01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:25.491
What's the matter with you?

01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:27.651
Be a man!

01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:38.882
The woman saw my face.

01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:41.246
The baby.

01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:51.529
You're not one of us.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.765
You haven't suffered like we have.

01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:02.684
This is your country.

01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:31.121
Well, I am sorry about your friend,
you know.

01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:35.410
But he was taken doing God's will.

01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:37.689
- A true martyr.
- And that soldier?

01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:40.451
I mean, he was just a reserve.

01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:43.925
My friend.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:47.766
Do you think they would publicise
the fact that he was a torturer?

01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:49.808
And what about the woman
and the baby, huh?

01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:51.689
Collateral damage.

01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:55.287
Who invented that phrase? That...
Enough of this!

01:05:57.360 --> 01:05:59.408
You know you can't stay
in this country, huh?

01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:03.764
Too dangerous. One door closes.

01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:05.851
Another opens.

01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:10.290
Before our colleague left,
he said you were a capable man.

01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:13.045
But that you... You know, you need

01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:18.365
experience to see what
these pigs do to your people.

01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:19.441
Hmm?

01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:22.684
I think he was right.

01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:26.971
Afghanistan.

01:06:29.800 --> 01:06:33.282
You'll go there, with a new identity,
to our friends.

01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:36.807
Be taught useful things,
then you'll come back.

01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:38.211
And if you don't return...

01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:45.051
then your prize will be more than
anything any one of us could wish for.

01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:47.960
Paradise.

01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:53.123
It's what you wanted, yes?

01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:01.401
An unidentified,
deceased male was found

01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:04.768
horrifically burnt in an abandoned
warehouse in East London.

01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:09.046
The body was so disfigured
no details of him are available.

01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:11.602
The location was
a known drugs factory

01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:14.251
and haunt of local gangs and dealers.

01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:15.651
- Police are treating...

01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:19.567
There's nothing we could have done.
We were doing our job.

01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:25.569
Our job is to do what's right.

01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:33.291
What did she mean?

01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:38.970
She said something about you.
What was she talking about?

01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:46.365
My wife was killed in the bombings
a few years back.

01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:51.571
I'm sorry.

01:07:54.760 --> 01:07:56.808
She'd have been 34 this year.

01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:04.008
She had nothing to do with all...
With all this, you know?

01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:07.848
Some days...

01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:12.604
Yeah, some days, I...

01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:19.845
That thing still in there?

01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:22.046
What?

01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:43.649
How do you turn it off?

01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:45.609
You turn it that way. No.

01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:47.361
That way.

01:08:47.439 --> 01:08:48.885
The other way.

01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:51.288
- The other way. Yeah.

01:09:09.319 --> 01:09:10.560
You OK?

01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:12.005
Fine.

01:09:19.399 --> 01:09:21.084
I remember this.

01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:22.960
It's embarrassing.

01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:30.488
Look, I'm sorry about what happened.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.401
About the way I acted back then.
If I could change it, I would.

01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:39.609
Is everything all right with you, Kate?

01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:43.167
- With your life?
- It's fine.

01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:49.002
It's not as easy as it used to be,
but don't have to talk about that now.

01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:52.961
We just... We slipped away.

01:09:57.680 --> 01:09:59.887
I have never stopped
thinking about you, Kate.

01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:02.723
You have to know that.

01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:20.090
Look, if you have things to do,
we could just meet this afternoon.

01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:23.284
I know this pub.

01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:27.011
I'd like to.

01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:38.725
Where have you been?

01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:45.241
Paul was meant to go ahead last night.

01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:47.485
He's vanished.

01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:54.127
- Were you followed?
- No.

01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:55.645
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

01:10:57.240 --> 01:10:59.242
We have to change our plans.

01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:02.880
You have to make contact
with the third man and help him.

01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:08.889
- You stay with him. I'll be in touch.
- When is he due to go ahead?

01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:10.726
Tomorrow.

01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:13.766
What's the matter with you?

01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:20.321
It isn't time to be weak and emotional.
We have no time for emotions now.

01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:24.527
Especially when your brothers
and sisters are suffering.

01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:55.610
You know who I am, yeah?

01:11:56.240 --> 01:11:58.322
- Yeah.
- Is there anything else?

01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:00.562
- Any papers? Receipts?
- No.

01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:03.444
OK, use this.

01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:06.531
I'm going to go first.

01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:09.610
You wait here for a few minutes
and then follow me, OK?

01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:13.201
You stay calm.

01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:47.568
Have a look round, Mark.
Check round the corner.

01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:49.165
Have a look up there.

01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:52.090
It's him!

01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:04.931
Fuck!

01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:42.327
- We got him.
I heard.

01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:43.925
There was someone there watching.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:45.650
- Who?
- I don't know.

01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:47.688
Somebody across the road.
He got away on a bike.

01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:49.524
He's connected.

01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:53.764
Get the CCTV footage.
Should be a clear shot of him.

01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:55.723
There are two rooms
at the Glassmore Hotel

01:13:55.800 --> 01:13:57.404
booked in the name
of Michael and John Smith.

01:13:57.480 --> 01:14:00.086
Check in.
I'll be there when I have something.

01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:03.448
One more thing. There is a team
on us, our people. Watch yourselves.

01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:06.525
Our people? Why?

01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:09.607
What we are doing is not
standard. Make sure that...

01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:14.605
Where the fuck's she gone?

01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:37.011
Hey-

01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:42.205
You look tired.

01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:43.691
I'm fine.

01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:47.121
It was a nightmare getting
here with all the madness.

01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:48.241
What?

01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:50.448
There was a bomb scare
on the train coming here.

01:14:51.680 --> 01:14:52.727
Scared shitless.

01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:57.922
Bunch of murdering maniacs.
Hope they kill the lot of them.

01:15:00.680 --> 01:15:03.809
You know when I said I didn't think
about those days at uni any more?

01:15:04.520 --> 01:15:06.329
- Yeah.
- I was lying.

01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:08.921
I know.

01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:14.248
You know, I thought I saw you
once a few years ago.

01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:17.202
I just lost you in the crowd.

01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:21.401
Well, I'm not going anywhere.

01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:28.164
Especially since it's your round.

01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:39.167
Can I get a red wine
and orange juice, please?

01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:40.571
No problem at all.

01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:48.406
There you go. That's £5 exactly.

01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:53.651
Thank you.

01:16:57.840 --> 01:17:00.207
Good, good. You take it to the car.

01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:05.371
Here, you, take...
Take the cake. I will be five minutes.

01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:15.644
My son, it's his birthday.

01:17:15.720 --> 01:17:17.688
They were there. They knew.

01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:19.683
You shouldn't be here.

01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:28.649
Your target is an American neo-con.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.970
Head of a think-tank, instrumental
in planning the war on terror.

01:17:33.760 --> 01:17:35.569
His daughter is getting married
to an Englishman.

01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:36.801
Where?

01:17:37.280 --> 01:17:39.931
I'll know tomorrow.
You still have your phone, huh?

01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:44.050
God be with you, my friend.

01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:51.766
Will I see my family?

01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:53.286
What?

01:17:56.560 --> 01:18:00.281
Oh, you'll see everyone
who's important in your life.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:04.129
Everyone who has passed away,
and... And... And it will seem like

01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:07.366
only half a day has passed
since you last saw them.

01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:10.521
Huh?

01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:39.966
You OK?

01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:41.846
I'm good.

01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:45.885
You did well.

01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:49.681
Stay alert.

01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:13.246
- Yeah.

01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:16.489
Yeah, I know the place.

01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:24.722
For those of you looking for reasons,

01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:27.280
then I suggest you pay
attention to what I have to say.

01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:31.522
For far too long, you've ignored
what is happening around you.

01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:34.729
You've not seen the inevitable
that is coming at you.

01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:36.723
The inevitability of my actions.

01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:14.563
Who are you, hey?

01:21:15.560 --> 01:21:17.005
Who are you working for?

01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:19.851
- Talk to me. Who sent you?

01:21:19.920 --> 01:21:21.843
 You've never opened
your mouths in protest

01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:23.445
at my people's suffering.

01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:24.686
Answer me!

01:21:24.760 --> 01:21:27.843
- Your silence has been deafening.
- Who sent you? Talk!

01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:30.605
Words have had no impact on you.

01:21:30.680 --> 01:21:32.728
Politics has had no impact on you.

01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:36.443
Look at Afghanistan, Iraq, Palestine.
The list goes on and on.

01:21:36.520 --> 01:21:38.090
And you continue to ignore it.

01:21:43.520 --> 01:21:45.443
You seem confused at our actions.

01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:48.169
Lost in your decadent world.

01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:49.606
Unable to act.

01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:51.331
Unable to move.

01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:53.164
Frozen in time.

01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:56.642
So now I'm going to communicate to
you in a language you can understand.

01:21:57.680 --> 01:21:58.886
My words are dead

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.526
until I give them life with
your blood and mine.

01:22:03.640 --> 01:22:05.608
(Static over earpiece)

01:22:13.160 --> 01:22:15.925
I'm sure by now your
newspapers and television

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:17.968
have depicted me as a madman,

01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:20.646
an evil outsider
hell-bent on destruction.

01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:23.407
Your corrupt and degenerate media

01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:26.051
will spin my actions to suit
the government agenda.

01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:29.404
They want you misinformed,
scared and docile,

01:22:29.480 --> 01:22:32.086
so that you continue to ignore
their murderous actions.

01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:37.645
They are happy for you
to lose yourself and all that this world

01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:39.768
has to offer so that you stay unaware

01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:42.764
and intoxicated
with their mindless chatter.

01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:46.407
So that you do not question
the situation you find yourselves in.

01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:49.041
Trapped in a vicious circle
of your own doing.

01:22:50.560 --> 01:22:52.642
My life has been a journey
towards violence,

01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:53.881
but it's not one I regret.

01:22:53.960 --> 01:22:56.850
There is no guilt for me.
There is no thoughts of the past

01:22:56.920 --> 01:22:59.002
or what I did or didn't do.
My search is over.

01:22:59.560 --> 01:23:00.891
My hands have been guided by

01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:03.361
a force that's greater
than anything on this world.

01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:04.885
I've found my peace.

01:23:05.640 --> 01:23:08.450
You must understand that things
do not happen without reason.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.082
There are no coincidences.

01:23:14.520 --> 01:23:16.010
Come in, come in.

01:23:16.080 --> 01:23:17.889
So listen carefully
to what I have to say.

01:23:17.960 --> 01:23:21.646
Where are you?
Give us your location, where are you?

01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:25.681
Everything is in position.
He has entered and heading towards

01:23:25.760 --> 01:23:28.684
the kitchen area.
CCTV has been immobilized.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:37.766
The material world that you
worship is meaningless and empty.

01:23:38.040 --> 01:23:39.724
It means nothing to me.

01:23:39.880 --> 01:23:41.370
I leave it behind gladly.

01:23:42.840 --> 01:23:45.491
- I have sacrificed myself...

01:23:45.560 --> 01:23:48.803
...for something higher than what
this world has to offer.

01:23:48.880 --> 01:23:50.609
I strive for a higher ground.

01:24:00.800 --> 01:24:02.768
Now, your government,

01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:06.489
the government that you voted for,

01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:09.484
commit atrocities against
my people all over this world.

01:24:12.680 --> 01:24:15.570
Your support for them
makes you responsible.

01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:17.366
I'm not a hypocrite.

01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:20.284
I will not sit by while my brothers
and sisters are being slaughtered.

01:25:09.720 --> 01:25:12.405
The path that has led me here
has been littered with obstacles.

01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:14.563
But I have remained strong.

01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:16.404
I am sure of my actions.

01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:17.845
Then I will not falter.

01:25:58.760 --> 01:26:02.526
Until you stop the bombing,
imprisonment and torture of my people,

01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:04.611
we will not stop.

01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:08.969
We have entered the realm of war,
and I am a soldier.

01:26:09.960 --> 01:26:13.521
Until we feel security,
you will be our targets.

01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:15.682
You are all responsible
for turning a blind eye

01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:17.524
to the butchery of my people.

01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:25.564
I'm only a man, but my actions
are the price you pay

01:26:25.640 --> 01:26:27.927
for your apathy, for your debauchery.

01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:31.849
I've lived amongst you,
but I'm not a part of you.

01:26:32.520 --> 01:26:34.409
You've not seen me until now.

01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:36.603
I am God's lonely man.

01:27:01.360 --> 01:27:04.330
Your 9/11s, your 7/7s,
are what my people

01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:06.767
suffer on a daily basis
around the world.

01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:08.683
You know nothing of suffering.

01:27:09.400 --> 01:27:11.209
So now I'm going to show you.

01:27:12.920 --> 01:27:15.161
My prayers have all been answered

01:27:15.240 --> 01:27:18.084
and no earthly force can
take them away from me.

01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:20.769
I will rise up against you.

01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:32.849
- You'll not forget me.

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:08.049
You have killed thousands
of my brothers and sisters.

01:28:09.320 --> 01:28:12.802
That much death has a consequence
you will pay for with your blood.

01:28:19.440 --> 01:28:23.001
There will be more like me,
l promise you.

01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:26.410
And we will bring hell
to you and your kind.

01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:34.162
And my conscience is clear.

01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:36.566
I have no regrets.

01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:42.845
I live forever. I go to a better place.

01:28:57.440 --> 01:28:59.329
What the hell is going on?

01:28:59.400 --> 01:29:01.084
You'll need my car.

01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:03.641
We need my car.

01:30:17.880 --> 01:30:19.803
- Don't! Stop!
- Where's your jacket?

01:31:54.200 --> 01:31:56.248
My name is Hussein Malik.

01:31:56.320 --> 01:31:57.401
For three years I've worked

01:31:57.480 --> 01:31:59.721
as an undercover agent
for our Secret Services

01:32:00.320 --> 01:32:03.529
and infiltrated Nabil Alawi
and his circle.

01:32:04.160 --> 01:32:06.766
Three months ago,
I discovered a plot by Nabil

01:32:06.840 --> 01:32:10.083
to steal Semtex for the purposes
of an attack on London.

01:32:10.920 --> 01:32:13.491
I informed my controllers
to arrest Nabil.

01:32:13.840 --> 01:32:16.446
The following day,
the first bomb exploded.

01:32:18.160 --> 01:32:21.846
I met with my controllers.
They tried to take my life.

01:32:21.920 --> 01:32:23.888
My life is in great danger.

01:32:23.960 --> 01:32:25.689
I need a guarantee of protection.

01:32:26.360 --> 01:32:28.567
A Secret Service team
are after me now.

01:32:29.440 --> 01:32:33.604
l have enclosed the evidence I have
accumulated and proof of my identity.

01:32:50.040 --> 01:32:53.203
Since sweeping to
power last month in a landslide victory,

01:32:53.280 --> 01:32:56.443
the new government has been
quick to make domestic security

01:32:56.520 --> 01:32:58.124
the top of their agenda.

01:32:58.520 --> 01:33:01.126
Having been given a mandate by
the public with such

01:33:01.200 --> 01:33:02.850
a resounding election victory,

01:33:02.920 --> 01:33:07.164
it's our duty to follow that lead,
and to prioritize making

01:33:07.240 --> 01:33:11.290
our country absolutely safe
from these cowardly terrorists.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:13.604
One of the government's first steps

01:33:13.680 --> 01:33:17.651
was the removal of the Secret
Service's old guard, Sir Scott Catesby,

01:33:18.160 --> 01:33:20.481
and the passing of
more stringent terror laws

01:33:20.560 --> 01:33:23.962
which saw the deportation
of the radical cleric Nabil Alawi.

01:33:24.480 --> 01:33:28.565
I am returning to my country
of birth tomorrow

01:33:28.640 --> 01:33:31.530
but I am distraught that the country

01:33:31.600 --> 01:33:35.491
that is my home is expelling me
on false charges.

01:33:36.120 --> 01:33:40.170
I will fight for my corner.
God save the Queen.

01:33:41.120 --> 01:33:42.770
Last week also saw

01:33:42.840 --> 01:33:45.047
the first official announcement
into the bombings.

01:33:45.640 --> 01:33:48.291
The perpetrators
were a home-grown cell.

01:33:49.280 --> 01:33:53.444
None had been identified as
potential threats prior to the attacks.

01:33:54.560 --> 01:33:57.530
Meaning they were all cleanskins,

01:33:57.840 --> 01:34:00.446
completely unknown to any
of the intelligence services.

01:34:01.720 --> 01:34:03.609
The ringleader,Ashraf Ahmed,

01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:07.082
was personally responsible for
the bombing of the Glassmore Hotel.

01:34:07.440 --> 01:34:10.444
The bomb was a timed device
placed in a luggage item,

01:34:10.600 --> 01:34:13.410
causing a massive explosion
in the foyer of the hotel.

01:34:13.840 --> 01:34:16.525
Ahmed himself was
killed by security services

01:34:16.600 --> 01:34:21.208
as he tried to trigger a suicide device
just prior to the foyer device exploding.

01:34:21.600 --> 01:34:24.604
Helen James, head of the
Glassmore Hotel Victims Committee,

01:34:24.680 --> 01:34:27.047
had this to say about the findings.

01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:29.964
I don't see how you solve
the underlying problem

01:34:30.040 --> 01:34:34.170
and I don't think anyone really does.
And, of course, this may lead to...

01:34:34.360 --> 01:34:38.285
to, you know, more security
and more troops going out

01:34:38.360 --> 01:34:40.362
and possibly more people being killed,

01:34:40.440 --> 01:34:42.090
but I don't see how
that solves the problem.

01:34:56.600 --> 01:35:00.161
Ewan! I thought they'd gotten to you.

01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:17.367
There you go.

01:35:51.720 --> 01:35:53.768
It was with his files.

01:35:55.560 --> 01:35:57.562
You must have left it
when you last met.

01:36:00.520 --> 01:36:02.363
You knew all about the bombings.

01:36:03.640 --> 01:36:05.324
Pretended you were
trying to stop them.

01:36:06.640 --> 01:36:08.881
You worked with this Nabil,

01:36:08.960 --> 01:36:12.009
then got him safely deported
without arrest.

01:36:12.080 --> 01:36:14.082
And I wasn't meant to make it out alive.

01:36:14.920 --> 01:36:17.446
You were in line with
a promotion of the new government,

01:36:17.800 --> 01:36:20.531
helped them win, got rid of your boss.
Must be happy with you.

01:36:24.080 --> 01:36:25.809
Played me perfectly.

01:36:28.120 --> 01:36:29.849
Knew all about my wife.

01:36:32.280 --> 01:36:34.521
Knew I'd kill anyone you put
in front of me.

01:36:36.520 --> 01:36:38.761
You can use her
as an excuse if you want.

01:36:39.640 --> 01:36:44.009
But what you do is in your nature.

01:36:50.640 --> 01:36:55.282
I love my country.
I'd kill for it and I'd die for it.

01:36:56.960 --> 01:36:58.405
Good for you.

01:37:01.840 --> 01:37:04.047
The press have been sent
copies of these files.

01:37:04.120 --> 01:37:05.884
They show you were responsible.

01:37:05.960 --> 01:37:07.849
Those files are nonsense you made up.

01:37:07.920 --> 01:37:09.763
No one will believe it.

01:37:09.840 --> 01:37:11.205
They might...

01:37:13.400 --> 01:37:16.449
if you buckle under
the pressure of the story.

01:37:23.360 --> 01:37:25.249
You're out of your mind.

01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:27.965
It's in my nature.
