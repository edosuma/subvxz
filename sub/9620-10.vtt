WEBVTT

00:01.501 --> 00:02.569
&gt;&gt;<i> TRUE JACKSON, VP</i>

00:02.635 --> 00:03.336
WAS FILMED IN FRONT

00:03.403 --> 00:06.706
OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:06.773 --> 00:08.608
&gt;&gt; LADIES, I'M ABOUT TO SHOW YOU

00:08.675 --> 00:09.409
THE MOST AMAZING THING

00:09.476 --> 00:10.477
YOU'VE EVER SEEN.

00:10.543 --> 00:11.177
&gt;&gt; THAT'S GONNA BE TOUGH

00:11.244 --> 00:12.145
BECAUSE MY AUNT HAS A DOG

00:12.212 --> 00:16.416
THAT CAN PLAY THE BANJO.

00:16.483 --> 00:17.484
&gt;&gt; BEHOLD,

00:17.550 --> 00:19.719
THE IMAGE OF TAYLOR SWIFT.

00:19.786 --> 00:21.187
&gt;&gt; IT LOOKS LIKE A RASH.

00:21.254 --> 00:22.389
&gt;&gt; NOT JUST ANY RASH.

00:22.455 --> 00:23.790
NOTICE THE CASCADING BLONDE HAIR

00:23.857 --> 00:25.125
AND CUTE, SQUINTY EYES?

00:25.191 --> 00:27.494
I'M GONNA BE RICH!

00:27.560 --> 00:28.461
&gt;&gt; WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

00:28.528 --> 00:30.130
OPEN A RASH MUSEUM?

00:30.196 --> 00:31.164
&gt;&gt; WE'RE OPEN SEVEN DAYS A WEEK

00:31.231 --> 00:33.166
EVERY DAY, EXCEPT TUESDAY.

00:33.233 --> 00:34.534
&gt;&gt; HELLO, KIDS.

00:34.601 --> 00:35.168
&gt;&gt; HEY, MR. MADIGAN.

00:35.235 --> 00:36.035
&gt;&gt; MR. MADIGAN,

00:36.102 --> 00:37.170
IF I OPENED A RASH MUSEUM

00:37.237 --> 00:38.938
WITH A REASONABLE ENTRANCE FEE,

00:39.005 --> 00:39.806
HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU THINK

00:39.873 --> 00:40.373
I COULD MAKE?

00:40.440 --> 00:40.940
&gt;&gt; I'M SORRY.

00:41.007 --> 00:41.941
IT ALMOST SOUNDED LIKE

00:42.008 --> 00:44.811
YOU SAID "RASH MUSEUM."

00:44.878 --> 00:45.712
&gt;&gt; I DID.

00:45.779 --> 00:46.513
&gt;&gt; WELL, I'D HAVE

00:46.579 --> 00:48.014
TO CRUNCH SOME NUMBERS,

00:48.081 --> 00:49.249
BUT I'D IMAGINE IF YOU SPENT,

00:49.315 --> 00:50.250
SAY, A THOUSAND DOLLARS

00:50.316 --> 00:51.317
OPENING YOUR MUSEUM,

00:51.384 --> 00:51.818
YOU'D LOSE

00:51.885 --> 00:52.585
YOUR ENTIRE INVESTMENT

00:52.652 --> 00:54.888
IN ABOUT AN HOUR.

00:54.954 --> 00:56.523
&gt;&gt; A WHOLE HOUR?

00:56.589 --> 00:59.459
I'M GONNA SEE IF JIMMY WANTS IN.

00:59.526 --> 01:00.360
&gt;&gt; WHAT'S GOIN' ON, MR. MADIGAN?

01:00.427 --> 01:01.528
DO YOU NEED SOMETHING?

01:01.594 --> 01:03.196
&gt;&gt; NO, I JUST THOUGHT I'D POP BY

01:03.263 --> 01:04.297
AND SEE HOW YOUR DESIGN

01:04.364 --> 01:05.465
FOR THE WRAPAROUND DRESS

01:05.532 --> 01:06.132
WAS COMING.

01:06.199 --> 01:07.033
&gt;&gt; I'M WORKING ON IT.

01:07.100 --> 01:08.468
&gt;&gt; NOW, THERE'S NO RUSH.

01:08.535 --> 01:09.502
I AM THINKING OF CALLING IT

01:09.569 --> 01:10.603
"THE DORIS,"

01:10.670 --> 01:12.105
IN HONOR OF MY BRIDE.

01:12.172 --> 01:13.273
&gt;&gt; THAT'S SO CUTE.

01:13.339 --> 01:14.174
&gt;&gt; YES, MISS AIDEM

01:14.240 --> 01:15.041
WILL LOVE IT.

01:15.108 --> 01:16.976
&gt;&gt; I FIGURE IT'LL CHEER HER UP.

01:17.043 --> 01:18.077
I KNOW SHE'S BEEN WORKING

01:18.144 --> 01:19.245
OVERTIME TRYING TO TRAIN

01:19.312 --> 01:21.781
HER GOOFY NEW ASSISTANT.

01:21.848 --> 01:22.782
&gt;&gt; GOOFY?

01:22.849 --> 01:23.983
&gt;&gt; WELL, I JUST ASSUMED

01:24.050 --> 01:24.617
HE'S GOOFY.

01:24.684 --> 01:25.285
I MEAN,

01:25.351 --> 01:29.255
WITH A NAME LIKE MR. WHIFFLE.

01:29.322 --> 01:30.924
&gt;&gt; HE'S REALLY NOT THAT GOOFY.

01:30.990 --> 01:31.758
&gt;&gt; YEAH, LANCE IS LIKE

01:31.825 --> 01:32.826
THE OPPOSITE OF GOOFY.

01:32.892 --> 01:33.960
&gt;&gt; LANCE?

01:34.027 --> 01:35.795
NO ONE SAID HIS NAME WAS LANCE.

01:35.862 --> 01:36.496
HIS NAME JUST GOT

01:36.563 --> 01:38.798
FIFTY PERCENT LESS GOOFY.

01:38.865 --> 01:39.532
&gt;&gt; HE'S NOT EVEN

01:39.599 --> 01:40.366
ONE PERCENT GOOFY.

01:40.433 --> 01:41.701
IF ANYTHING, HE'S PRETTY HUNKY.

01:41.768 --> 01:42.735
&gt;&gt; HUNKY?

01:42.802 --> 01:44.771
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

01:44.838 --> 01:45.705
&gt;&gt; WELL, I DON'T KNOW

01:45.772 --> 01:46.940
ABOUT HUNKY.

01:47.006 --> 01:48.408
RIGHT, LULU?

01:48.475 --> 01:49.642
&gt;&gt; ARE YOU SERIOUS?

01:49.709 --> 01:50.310
SOMEONE BETTER

01:50.376 --> 01:51.044
CALL ANIMAL CONTROL,

01:51.110 --> 01:51.978
'CAUSE THERE IS A FOX

01:52.045 --> 01:53.246
IN THE LIBRARY.

01:53.313 --> 01:54.180
&gt;&gt; KEEP IT TOGETHER.

01:54.247 --> 01:55.515
&gt;&gt; PLUS, HE'S CRAZY STRONG.

01:55.582 --> 01:55.982
&gt;&gt; NO, NO, NO,

01:56.049 --> 01:57.083
HE'S NOT THAT STRONG.

01:57.150 --> 01:58.051
&gt;&gt; TRUE, I EXPECT

01:58.117 --> 01:59.819

04:34.007 --> 04:35.241
MIGHT HAVE A DOLLY YOU CAN USE.

04:35.308 --> 04:38.544

WHERE YOU'RE HEADED WITH THIS,

05:48.114 --> 05:48.715
MR. MADIGAN.

05:48.781 --> 05:49.215
&gt;&gt; HOW MUCH TIME

05:49.282 --> 05:50.016
WOULD YOU SAY HIM AND DORIS

05:50.983 --> 05:51.584
&gt;&gt; I REALLY DON'T WANNA

05:51.651 --> 05:52.852
GET IN THE MIDDLE OF ANYTHING.

05:52.919 --> 05:54.120
&gt;&gt; I'M NOT ASKING YOU

05:54.187 --> 05:54.754
TO GET IN THE MIDDLE

05:54.821 --> 05:55.521

05:55.588 --> 05:56.756
I'M MERELY ASKING YOU

05:56.823 --> 05:58.057

EVERYTHING YOU SEE.

06:00.093 --> 06:01.828
MAYBE, TAKE A FEW PICTURES

06:01.894 --> 06:02.428
WITH THIS

06:02.495 --> 06:05.465

A PERFECTLY GOOD TOWNHOUSE

12:19.538 --> 12:21.107
NOT 10 BLOCKS AWAY?

12:21.173 --> 12:22.575
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

12:22.641 --> 12:29.115
I HAVE TO GO BRUSH MY TEETH.

12:29.181 --> 12:30.816
THAT'S ODD, I JUST ASSUMED

12:30.883 --> 12:33.219
THERE WAS A SINK IN HERE.

12:33.285 --> 12:33.786
&gt;&gt; I'M JUST GONNA

12:33.853 --> 12:34.420
GRAB SOME CEREAL,

12:34.487 --> 12:35.421
AND I'LL BE OUT OF YOUR WAY.

12:35.488 --> 12:36.021
&gt;&gt; WOULD YOU BELIEVE

12:36.088 --> 12:38.090
DORIS HAS NEVER HAD CEREAL?

12:38.157 --> 12:38.757
&gt;&gt; FOR REAL?

12:38.824 --> 12:39.725
&gt;&gt; SHE DOESN'T BELIEVE

12:39.792 --> 12:40.659
IN BREAKFAST.

12:40.726 --> 12:42.228
SHE THINKS IT'S A CONSPIRACY

12:42.294 --> 12:44.196
PERPETRATED BY THE EGG INDUSTRY.

12:44.263 --> 12:45.798
&gt;&gt; THAT SOUNDS LIKE MISS AIDEM.

12:45.865 --> 12:49.935
&gt;&gt; SHE IS ONE OF A KIND.

12:50.002 --> 12:50.703
&gt;&gt; I WISH THERE WAS SOMETHING

12:50.769 --> 12:51.570
I COULD DO.

12:51.637 --> 12:52.905
&gt;&gt; MAYBE THERE IS.

12:52.972 --> 12:53.639
&gt;&gt; REALLY?

12:53.706 --> 12:54.306
'CAUSE I MEANT IT

12:54.373 --> 12:56.509
MORE LIKE AN EXPRESSION.

12:56.575 --> 12:57.443
&gt;&gt; YOU COULD TALK TO DORIS

12:57.510 --> 12:58.144
FOR ME.

12:58.210 --> 12:59.145
&gt;&gt; I DON'T THINK I CAN DO THAT.

12:59.211 --> 13:00.045
I MEAN, WHERE AM I

13:00.112 --> 13:01.013
EVEN GONNA SEE HER?

13:01.080 --> 13:02.114
&gt;&gt; AT SCHOOL?

13:02.181 --> 13:04.183
IN HER PLACE OF EMPLOYMENT?

13:04.250 --> 13:05.518
&gt;&gt; YEAH, BUT THE LIBRARY'S

13:05.584 --> 13:06.352
ALL THE WAY DOWN THE HALL.

13:06.418 --> 13:07.019
IT'S PRACTICALLY

13:07.086 --> 13:07.786
ON THE OTHER SIDE

13:07.853 --> 13:12.491
OF THE CAFETERIA.

13:12.558 --> 13:15.127
&gt;&gt; I'LL TALK TO HER.

13:15.194 --> 13:19.298
&gt;&gt; THANKS, TRUE.

13:19.365 --> 13:21.333
[GASPS]

13:21.400 --> 13:21.800
&gt;&gt; MISS AIDEM,

13:21.867 --> 13:23.469
DID YOU SLEEP HERE?

13:23.536 --> 13:24.170
&gt;&gt; WELL, I CERTAINLY

13:24.236 --> 13:25.538
WASN'T GOING BACK TO THAT HOUSE

13:25.604 --> 13:27.406
WITH THAT MAN.

13:27.473 --> 13:28.107
&gt;&gt; HE WASN'T THERE.

13:28.174 --> 13:29.842
MR. MADIGAN SLEPT IN HIS OFFICE.

13:29.909 --> 13:31.043
&gt;&gt; HE DID?

13:31.110 --> 13:31.777
I WISH I KNEW THAT

13:31.844 --> 13:32.845
BEFORE I TOOK A BATH

13:32.912 --> 13:35.648
IN THE SINK.

13:35.714 --> 13:36.415
&gt;&gt; MAYBE NOW THAT YOU TWO HAVE

13:36.482 --> 13:37.416
HAD A CHANCE TO SLEEP ON IT,

13:37.483 --> 13:39.251
YOU CAN SIT DOWN AND TALK.

13:39.318 --> 13:40.152
&gt;&gt; IF HE CAN'T TRUST ME

13:40.219 --> 13:41.153
THEN THERE'S NOTHING

13:41.220 --> 13:42.421
TO TALK ABOUT.

13:42.488 --> 13:43.122
&gt;&gt; MISS AIDEM?

13:43.189 --> 13:44.256
&gt;&gt; NOTHING!

13:44.323 --> 13:45.791
OH MY--THAT'S THE FIRST TIME

13:45.858 --> 13:46.692
I'VE EVER RAISED MY VOICE

13:46.759 --> 13:48.427
IN THE LIBRARY.

13:48.494 --> 13:54.800
THIS IS VERY LIBERATING.

13:54.867 --> 13:55.768
&gt;&gt; WHAT DID MR. MADIGAN SAY

13:55.834 --> 13:56.502
WHEN YOU DIDN'T TURN IN

13:56.569 --> 13:57.670
YOUR DESIGN YESTERDAY?

13:57.736 --> 13:58.204
&gt;&gt; WELL, I THOUGHT

13:58.270 --> 13:58.971
HE WAS GONNA BE MAD,

13:59.038 --> 14:00.439
THEN HE TOLD ME TO TAKE MY TIME.

14:00.506 --> 14:01.207
WHEN I TOOK MY TIME,

14:01.273 --> 14:02.441
HE GOT MAD AT ME.

14:02.508 --> 14:03.609
THEN I APOLOGIZED AND HE SAID,

14:03.676 --> 14:04.577
"TAKE IT EASY."

14:04.643 --> 14:05.244
&gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT YOU GET

14:05.311 --> 14:06.011
FOR GETTING IN THE MIDDLE.

14:06.078 --> 14:06.645
&gt;&gt; I DIDN'T WANNA

14:06.712 --> 14:08.447
GET IN THE MIDDLE!

14:08.514 --> 14:10.249
I HATE ALL THIS DRAMA.

14:10.316 --> 14:10.983
&gt;&gt; IT FREAKS ME OUT WHEN

14:11.050 --> 14:12.551
GROWNUPS ACT LIKE TEENAGERS.

14:12.618 --> 14:13.619
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT'S FUNNY?

14:13.686 --> 14:14.687
MIKEY J AND I HAVE

14:14.753 --> 14:15.521
A MORE MATURE RELATIONSHIP

14:15.588 --> 14:16.222
THAN THE MADIGANS

14:16.288 --> 14:18.123
AND TECHNICALLY, WE'RE CHILDREN.

14:18.190 --> 14:18.824
&gt;&gt; WHAT YOU AND MIKEY J HAVE

14:18.891 --> 14:19.692
IS REALLY SPECIAL.

14:19.758 --> 14:20.459
&gt;&gt; I KNOW.

14:20.526 --> 14:21.227
I STILL GET THE WHIRLIES

14:21.293 --> 14:21.760
IN MY STOMACH

14:21.827 --> 14:23.229
WHEN I THINK ABOUT HIM.

14:23.295 --> 14:23.896
&gt;&gt; MAYBE MR. MADIGAN

14:23.963 --> 14:24.630
AND MISS AIDEM

14:24.697 --> 14:25.731
NEED THE WHIRLIES.

14:25.798 --> 14:26.465
WE SHOULD GIVE THEM

14:26.532 --> 14:27.566
A SUPER ROMANTIC DATE

14:27.633 --> 14:28.434
SO THEY CAN FALL IN LOVE

14:28.500 --> 14:29.702
ALL OVER AGAIN.

14:29.768 --> 14:31.804
&gt;&gt; YEAH, WE CAN GET FLOWERS,

14:35.507 --> 14:36.508
&gt;&gt; WHAT?

14:36.575 --> 14:37.543
I AM MUCH MORE ROMANTIC

14:37.610 --> 14:39.411
THAN PEOPLE GIVE ME CREDIT FOR.

14:39.478 --> 14:42.081
&gt;&gt; YOU'RE OPENING A RASH MUSEUM.

14:42.147 --> 14:45.050
&gt;&gt; UH-HUH.

14:45.117 --> 14:46.185
&gt;&gt; IF MR. MADIGAN AND MISS AIDEM

14:46.252 --> 14:47.086
AREN'T TALKING TO EACH OTHER,

14:47.152 --> 14:47.786
HOW ARE YOU GONNA GET THEM

14:47.853 --> 14:48.921
TO GO ON A DATE?

14:48.988 --> 14:49.788
&gt;&gt; THE MOST ROMANTIC WAY

14:49.855 --> 14:51.056
I CAN...

14:51.123 --> 14:56.595
BY TRICKING THEM.

14:58.130 --> 14:59.031
&gt;&gt; HOW CAN YOU NOT FIND IT

14:59.098 --> 14:59.798
FUNNY?

14:59.865 --> 15:02.901
IT'S GOT THE WORD "POOP" IN IT.

15:02.968 --> 15:04.303
&gt;&gt; I JUST DON'T GET IT.
