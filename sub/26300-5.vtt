00:01.020 --> 00:02.950
<i>So this is what happened
last time on</i> Star.

00:02.960 --> 00:04.640
- Rusty?
- Musty?

00:04.710 --> 00:06.539
When's the last time
I seen your ass?

00:06.540 --> 00:07.920
<i>Don't you think you're doing</i>

00:07.939 --> 00:09.870
a little much with
this Olivia girl?

00:09.940 --> 00:12.540
- Why are you so worried?
- Because I can be.

00:12.620 --> 00:13.986
<i>I was hoping you
could take a look</i>

00:14.010 --> 00:15.990
- at my contract with Karma.
- Maurice's club.

00:16.000 --> 00:17.870
<i>I need somebody who
knows his weaknesses.</i>

00:17.930 --> 00:18.980
<i>This thing between you and</i>

00:19.000 --> 00:20.470
Auntie Cassie has gone too far.

00:20.480 --> 00:21.500
You don't know who she is

00:21.520 --> 00:22.860
<i>and what she's capable of.</i>

00:26.200 --> 00:27.220
<i>You can't keep walking around</i>

00:27.240 --> 00:28.690
<i>with all this pain
in you like that.</i>

00:28.710 --> 00:30.026
<i>You got to figure out
how to release it.</i>

00:30.050 --> 00:31.500
You ever thought about
going to get some help?

00:31.520 --> 00:34.280
<i>I'm good. At least
I-I'm getting there.</i>

00:38.750 --> 00:41.120
Can't believe I'm
about to say this,

00:41.140 --> 00:43.740
but I feel like maybe we
should call the cops.

00:43.750 --> 00:44.750
I agree.

00:44.760 --> 00:46.360
Yo, the cops are not
gonna do nothing.

00:46.380 --> 00:47.720
This is not even
an emergency yet.

00:47.740 --> 00:50.450
Girl, my mama left the house
without a purse and a phone.

00:50.480 --> 00:52.120
How that's not an
emergency to you?

00:52.150 --> 00:54.080
I don't know, maybe we're
overthinking this.

00:54.100 --> 00:56.586
I mean, she hasn't slept here in
the past few days anyway, right?

00:56.610 --> 00:58.940
She could come in at any moment.

01:00.680 --> 01:03.120
Hey, y'all, I can't
find C nowhere.

01:03.200 --> 01:05.590
The hell y'all got "Steppin'
to the Bad Side" here for?

01:05.610 --> 01:07.030
- Really, Bruce?
- Come on, y'all.

01:07.050 --> 01:09.100
Let's stick together
for Mama, please.

01:09.120 --> 01:11.690
Cotton, you can't get rid of no
storm with thunder on your back.

01:11.750 --> 01:13.000
She part of the
reason we're here.

01:13.020 --> 01:14.280
You know it's not just me.

01:14.300 --> 01:15.830
You know Carlotta's
done this before.

01:15.860 --> 01:18.260
Really? You're a evil
bitch to bring that up.

01:18.400 --> 01:20.480
You know that ain't got
nothing to do with this.

01:20.580 --> 01:21.636
What are y'all talking about?

01:21.660 --> 01:23.080
That's your mama's business.

01:24.300 --> 01:25.970
Cassie, why are you still here?

01:27.360 --> 01:29.160
Know what?

01:29.310 --> 01:31.010
Let me know when y'all find her.

01:31.070 --> 01:33.570
Okay, so what are we
supposed to do now?

01:33.640 --> 01:35.690
You gonna do exactly what
Carlotta would want y'all to do.

01:35.710 --> 01:37.690
You gonna pray and
keep it moving.

01:37.710 --> 01:39.096
Now, she got a meeting
set up tomorrow

01:39.120 --> 01:40.910
with Chris Mackey from
Bling Lifestyle Brand

01:40.980 --> 01:42.600
- to sponsor Rhythm & Bells.
- Bling?

01:42.620 --> 01:44.990
Wait, they sponsored
Coachella last year, right?

01:45.050 --> 01:46.550
Exactly, they'll
give us the capital

01:46.560 --> 01:48.560
and the street cred
this festival needs.

01:48.680 --> 01:50.360
And her plan was to have
y'all to seal the deal

01:50.380 --> 01:52.036
- with the performance at Karma.
- Okay.

01:52.060 --> 01:54.500
So, we're supposed to perform
when Miss Carlotta's missing?

01:54.560 --> 01:56.146
Carlotta's been here for all of us...
when I ain't have nothing

01:56.170 --> 01:57.746
and when y'all decided
to come to Atlanta.

01:57.770 --> 01:59.700
The least we can do is make
sure we handle this business

01:59.720 --> 02:01.900
till we find her.

02:06.440 --> 02:08.100
Remember this?

02:09.650 --> 02:12.740
Oh, you did not whip that out.

02:12.840 --> 02:14.920
Ah, look at the face.

02:14.960 --> 02:16.820
What's wrong with that?

02:16.890 --> 02:18.230
All right, Kid 'n Play.
Kid 'n Play.

02:18.250 --> 02:19.790

fine, educated sister.

05:12.410 --> 05:14.440
There you go with
all that charm.

05:14.510 --> 05:15.660
Is it working?

05:16.550 --> 05:19.420
The music is good.

05:19.490 --> 05:21.450
It reminds me of
your first album.

05:21.490 --> 05:23.250
Yeah, my first album
was on a major label.

Now I'm on an indie.
Good has to be great.

05:28.260 --> 05:32.600
I left the biggest law firm
in Atlanta after my divorce.

05:32.650 --> 05:34.870
Started from scratch,
became my own boss,

05:34.880 --> 05:36.130
just like you're doing now.

05:36.200 --> 05:38.400
And I regretted it, just
like you're doing now.

05:38.470 --> 05:42.440
But trust me, it's worth it.

05:42.470 --> 05:44.910
Thanks.

05:44.980 --> 05:47.399

Orange Night bounced.

06:04.060 --> 06:06.320

06:06.460 --> 06:10.420

probably a mix-up.

Are you gambling again?

06:16.180 --> 06:17.780
Damn it.

06:17.840 --> 06:19.139
You promised me that would stop

06:19.140 --> 06:20.560
once we started Gravity Media.

06:20.680 --> 06:21.700
How bad is it?

06:21.710 --> 06:24.650
I just borrowed some
money to sit at a table

06:27.040 --> 06:28.960

06:50.580 --> 06:52.540

My meeting was with Carlotta
Brown; is she coming?

07:02.860 --> 07:05.690
I'm filling in for her, and
this is her business plan.

07:05.700 --> 07:07.760
Well, I'm not turning
over a $10 million check

07:07.830 --> 07:10.090
- to someone like you.
- Like me?

07:10.160 --> 07:13.300
I'll continue this with
Carlotta tonight at the club.

07:13.370 --> 07:15.030
She will be there?

07:15.100 --> 07:17.170
Yes, sir. She will be.

07:17.240 --> 07:19.360
Mateo Ferrera.
Pleasure to meet you.

07:19.400 --> 07:21.120
You, also.

07:21.840 --> 07:24.260
Tonight, gentlemen.

07:24.300 --> 07:26.210
We'll see you later.

07:26.280 --> 07:28.750
- Where the hell is she?
- Look, she had something to do.

07:28.810 --> 07:30.910
You tell Carlotta to get her
ass to the club tonight.

07:30.980 --> 07:34.490
- She'll be there, Mateo.
- Well, she better be.

07:34.550 --> 07:37.400
Because we need to land Bling.

07:39.490 --> 07:41.320
The officer who
brought you in says

07:41.340 --> 07:42.979
he found you in a
concerning condition.

07:42.980 --> 07:45.960
Any time a black woman does
anything other than smile,

07:46.030 --> 07:47.430
they think she crazy.

07:47.500 --> 07:48.819
How'd you hurt yourself?

07:48.820 --> 07:50.199
I told you, I had an accident.

07:50.200 --> 07:52.200
Look, there is nothing
wrong with me.

07:52.210 --> 07:54.040
I've just been under a
lot of stress lately.

07:54.110 --> 07:55.910
I can see that; you
seem agitated.

07:55.970 --> 07:57.530
Because I keep trying to
explain to you that...

07:57.540 --> 07:58.619
Calm down.

07:58.620 --> 08:00.280
Don't tell me to calm down.

08:00.310 --> 08:02.610
It's not against the law
to walk down the street.

08:02.680 --> 08:05.480
I ended up in a coffee shop,
and the next thing I know,

08:05.550 --> 08:08.590
is the sun came up before
I did, that's all.

08:08.650 --> 08:10.400
Have you ever had any
issues with mental health?

08:10.420 --> 08:12.639
Look, I do not need
to be in here;

08:12.640 --> 08:14.560
I have meetings to get to.

08:14.700 --> 08:16.059
My name is Carlotta Brown.

08:16.060 --> 08:18.060
I am the CEO of Gravity Records.

08:18.120 --> 08:19.980
All you have to do is google it.

08:20.020 --> 08:22.500
I did and it appears this
isn't your first incident.

08:22.570 --> 08:24.500
You had a bit of a
break in the past.

08:24.570 --> 08:26.200
- What?
- Karma.

08:26.300 --> 08:28.640
You had a very public
argument with the owner.

08:28.710 --> 08:30.240
There appears to be
a loss of control.

08:30.310 --> 08:31.640
I had a fight with my sister.

08:31.720 --> 08:34.340
And another public
incident this morning.

08:34.409 --> 08:37.350
Look, you are not about to
put a mental case on me.

08:37.419 --> 08:38.880
Now let me out of this place!

08:39.720 --> 08:41.850
Miss Brown, I'm afraid
I can't do that.

08:41.919 --> 08:44.420
With your behavior, you
leave me no choice.

08:44.490 --> 08:48.700
For your safety, you'll be
placed on a 72-hour hold.

08:56.500 --> 08:58.400
♪ Who's your mama
and your daddy? ♪

08:58.420 --> 08:59.920
♪ Is they rich like me? ♪

08:59.990 --> 09:02.139
♪ They screaming "I bring me" ♪

09:02.140 --> 09:04.220
♪ Bish, I'm the one that
brought the table ♪

09:04.230 --> 09:06.100
♪ I'm the boss, I'm the king ♪

09:06.220 --> 09:09.300
♪ Pick a team, pick
a team, yeah. ♪

09:09.580 --> 09:11.980
Ooh. This feels different
when you're pregnant.

09:12.050 --> 09:14.680
Hey, y'all. Cotton called.

09:14.750 --> 09:15.880
Cops found Carlotta.

09:15.950 --> 09:19.720
She was in a diner, asleep.
Poor thing peed herself.

09:19.790 --> 09:22.940
They got her in the hospital,
under psych evaluation.

09:23.020 --> 09:25.220
But she ain't even crazy.

09:25.560 --> 09:27.000
Being locked in
them kind of places

09:27.020 --> 09:28.400
can make you think you crazy.

09:29.340 --> 09:31.350
So, I think the biggest
thing for us right now

09:31.380 --> 09:33.116
is to make sure we nail
this performance tonight.

09:33.140 --> 09:35.500
Did you have your
meeting with Bling?

09:35.540 --> 09:36.970
I got mine covered on this end.

09:37.040 --> 09:38.640
You make sure you
figure out how to twerk

09:38.660 --> 09:40.200
without that baby falling out.

09:42.310 --> 09:44.510
Olivia. Hi.

09:44.580 --> 09:47.020
I'm so sorry; I
completely forgot

09:47.080 --> 09:50.080
that you were coming.
It's a weird, crazy time.

09:50.100 --> 09:52.800
- Carlotta's in the hospital.
- Oh, my God.

09:52.960 --> 09:55.420
Carlotta, she's like a
second mother to you.

09:55.490 --> 09:56.499
Should we go see her or...?

09:56.500 --> 09:58.360
Girl, back off. You
don't even know her.

10:00.430 --> 10:02.520
I need some air.

10:02.560 --> 10:05.380
Yo, so this might not be
a good time for you to,

10:05.420 --> 10:08.170
you know, hang out and do
whatever you do with Alex.

10:08.240 --> 10:11.940
Uh, I can help. Maybe
run errands, something?

10:11.980 --> 10:15.000
I just want to keep my
mind off tomorrow, okay?

10:15.120 --> 10:17.040
It would've been
Bianca's birthday.

10:17.060 --> 10:20.480
Oh, of-of course. No, stay.

10:20.550 --> 10:23.120
Okay, it's... We can figure
out something for you to do.

10:23.190 --> 10:24.820
Okay.

10:30.280 --> 10:32.000
This is what my client wants.

10:32.040 --> 10:33.830
I know you can do
better, Maurice.

10:36.800 --> 10:40.370
- I hope you know he's using you.
- Excuse me?

10:40.440 --> 10:43.040
Of all the lawyers in Atlanta,
he trots you up in here?

10:43.110 --> 10:46.340
He's trying to get to me so
I can cave to his demands.

10:46.380 --> 10:48.780
You always make
everything about you.

10:48.850 --> 10:50.910
Has he tried to press
up on you yet?

10:50.950 --> 10:52.510
That is none of your business.

10:52.580 --> 10:54.700
- You didn't answer the question.
- Ah.

10:54.720 --> 10:57.740
I still love you, and he's
taking full advantage...

10:57.780 --> 10:59.570
Bring something to the
table for my client

10:59.600 --> 11:01.720
so we can sign and finish this.

11:01.790 --> 11:03.960
Megan...

11:09.100 --> 11:10.920
Hey.

11:10.940 --> 11:13.570
Hey, I was looking for you.

11:13.640 --> 11:15.900
You okay?

11:15.970 --> 11:18.470
Just family stuff.

11:18.540 --> 11:20.480
I'm just worried.

11:20.540 --> 11:24.180
You know, Miss Carlotta
wandered off last night,

11:24.250 --> 11:26.280
and the police found
her this morning,

11:26.300 --> 11:30.350
and they decided to put her
on a 72-hour psych hold.

11:30.420 --> 11:34.659
And we're all trying to
be strong for her, but...

11:34.660 --> 11:37.570
I know what it's like
to have to be strong

11:37.580 --> 11:39.790
when you don't know if you can.

11:40.740 --> 11:45.070
Hey, listen, I... came
to find you to say,

11:45.100 --> 11:48.520
if you need help with the
script thing, I can help.

11:48.540 --> 11:51.020
Thanks. I'll think about it.

11:51.060 --> 11:52.570
Nina?

11:52.640 --> 11:55.480
Yeah, I should probably get
back to rehearsal, though.

11:55.550 --> 11:57.980
Mm.

12:00.180 --> 12:01.680
No word from Carlotta.

12:01.750 --> 12:03.720
She's not gonna call you back.

12:03.790 --> 12:05.820
She's in the hospital.

12:05.960 --> 12:08.320
She's not showing up tonight.

12:08.390 --> 12:11.330
Well, no Carlotta, no
money, no festival.

12:11.400 --> 12:14.130
Since when do you care so much
about this damn festival?

12:14.200 --> 12:16.830
Two months ago, you wanted
to close Gravity Records.

12:16.850 --> 12:19.660
And I still might, but if this
festival could be the answer

12:19.680 --> 12:21.479
for our financial problems,
of course I'm gonna do it.

12:21.480 --> 12:22.670
Listen to yourself.

12:22.740 --> 12:24.860
We're gonna find another way
to fix your damn problem.

12:29.280 --> 12:31.750
I appreciate you taking me last
minute, know what I'm saying?

12:31.820 --> 12:33.880
I mean, I know you're busy.

12:33.950 --> 12:36.450
Look, cutting hair
keeps me calm.

12:36.520 --> 12:38.520
I don't know what to do
with Carlotta being stuck

12:38.540 --> 12:40.040
in a hospital like that.

12:41.260 --> 12:43.400
How are things with y'all?

12:44.080 --> 12:45.920
You and Noah getting along?

12:46.180 --> 12:48.600
You know that boy
always pushing me.

12:48.670 --> 12:50.660
As he should.

12:50.740 --> 12:53.030
You can't disappoint
somebody over and over.

12:53.100 --> 12:54.470
That boy almost took his life.

12:54.480 --> 12:55.640
- And I saved it.
- Okay, well, Bobby,

12:55.660 --> 12:58.170
you ain't getting no trophies
handed to you over here

12:58.240 --> 13:00.390
'cause of something you caused,
and I ain't about to waste time

13:00.410 --> 13:02.330
telling you how you need all
the black beat off your ass

13:02.340 --> 13:03.880
for what you did to your son.

13:03.950 --> 13:05.450
I've got my own mess.

13:05.520 --> 13:07.280
This Carlotta stuff is...

13:07.350 --> 13:11.020
I guess it brings you back to your pops...
the pastor, right?

13:11.840 --> 13:14.780
I know you used to talk
about it all the time.

13:17.600 --> 13:19.170
You know, he locked
me up like Carlotta

13:19.200 --> 13:21.000
when I told him I was gay.

13:21.520 --> 13:24.060
Had them folk call me
everything but a child of God.

13:24.100 --> 13:26.130
Yet, that's exactly what
they wanted me to be.

13:28.070 --> 13:30.910
You know, Stevie Wonder could
see more than church folk.

13:32.710 --> 13:34.510
Oh, I know that laugh.

13:34.580 --> 13:37.260
The one you push out
so you don't feel.

13:37.480 --> 13:39.050
You're gonna have to face it.

13:39.120 --> 13:40.660
Now, who are you supposed to be?
Iyanla?

13:40.680 --> 13:42.820
Did you come to get a haircut,

13:42.850 --> 13:44.420
or you came to fix my life?

13:44.490 --> 13:47.100
Can't nobody fix your life.

13:47.220 --> 13:48.990
Hold your head still

13:49.000 --> 13:50.900
so I can cut these little
nappy edges of yours.

14:01.640 --> 14:03.740
Oh.

14:07.980 --> 14:09.910
Mama?

14:09.980 --> 14:11.980
Hey.

14:12.270 --> 14:15.230
I left you some clothes
at the front desk.

14:15.300 --> 14:17.400
Okay.

14:18.870 --> 14:21.540
Hey, they're not trying
to hurt you in here, huh?

14:21.610 --> 14:22.960
No, I'm okay.

14:23.060 --> 14:24.660
Better than they think I am.

14:24.700 --> 14:27.700
Mama, we were so worried. We
all went looking for you.

14:27.720 --> 14:29.730
The girls, Miss Bruce,
even Auntie Cassie came...

14:29.800 --> 14:31.630
Cassie?

14:31.700 --> 14:34.170
That bitch is the
reason why I'm here.

14:34.240 --> 14:36.220
- She ain't tell you that?
- Mama,

14:36.240 --> 14:38.020
Tita Cassie don't have
nothing to do with this.

14:38.040 --> 14:39.640
This is about you
doing too much.

14:39.660 --> 14:41.320
She told us how you
used to wander...

14:41.380 --> 14:44.550
Don't listen to a
word she has to say.

14:46.950 --> 14:49.280
Cassie wanted Andy dead.

14:50.820 --> 14:54.320
That bullet that hit your
father was meant for him.

14:57.460 --> 14:59.590
Cassie killed your daddy.

15:01.830 --> 15:04.879
But-but Mama, she was...

15:04.880 --> 15:06.299
How...?

15:06.300 --> 15:08.039
I'm sorry.

15:08.040 --> 15:10.540
- But you told me, Mama...
- I did not want to hurt you,

15:10.610 --> 15:13.270
but this lie has been
weighing itself down on me,

15:13.340 --> 15:15.480
and I can't hold it no more.

15:15.550 --> 15:17.910
I'm just too tired.

15:17.980 --> 15:20.150
Oh...

15:30.160 --> 15:32.260
It looks a lot better on Alex.

15:34.030 --> 15:36.600
She asked me to bring
a few things for her.

15:36.670 --> 15:38.370
Mm.

15:38.440 --> 15:40.540
I heard about how you jumped in

15:40.560 --> 15:42.270
on her solo performance
the other night.

15:42.310 --> 15:44.140
That was weird.

15:44.220 --> 15:46.120
I just want to let you
know, if you try something

15:46.140 --> 15:49.410
- like that tomorrow night...
- What you gonna do? Hmm?

15:49.480 --> 15:51.080
Oh, it's not what, baby.
It's how.

15:51.110 --> 15:53.960
Where'd you come
from, by the way?

15:54.150 --> 15:56.120
Hong Kong.

15:56.190 --> 15:58.120
Oh, you're funny.

15:58.190 --> 16:00.920
Okay. Good to know.

16:00.990 --> 16:03.430
I could be funny, too. Watch.

16:03.490 --> 16:05.260
Don't watch too hard.

16:05.330 --> 16:06.900
You know, it's dark outside.

16:06.930 --> 16:10.200
I wouldn't want you to trip
and fall with that baby.

16:10.270 --> 16:12.220
Threaten my child's life again,

16:12.240 --> 16:14.340
and you'll be buried next
to your dead sister.

16:25.990 --> 16:28.020
- I got to go.
- What up?

16:28.060 --> 16:30.600
Hey. Any news on Carlotta?

16:30.620 --> 16:32.040
Nothing yet.

16:32.260 --> 16:34.830
But you know who actually
needs to be locked up?

16:34.900 --> 16:36.430
That Olivia girl.

16:36.500 --> 16:37.900
She's crazy.

16:37.970 --> 16:40.000
You see the irony there?

16:40.070 --> 16:41.860
Calling somebody else crazy?

16:41.960 --> 16:43.470
All right.

16:43.540 --> 16:45.700
Then nobody knows crazy
better than me, right?

16:45.720 --> 16:47.640
I'm dead-ass worried about Alex.

16:47.700 --> 16:49.340
I can't keep up with you.

16:49.680 --> 16:51.810
One minute you're making
a diss track about Alex,

16:51.820 --> 16:54.020
the next, you're telling the
man at home in a wheelchair

16:54.060 --> 16:56.220
- that you're worried about her.
- Yeah.

16:56.600 --> 16:58.160
Alex and I are family.

16:58.260 --> 17:01.320
We fight, but I would never
let somebody hurt her.

17:01.400 --> 17:02.980
So tell me you don't think
there's something wrong

17:02.990 --> 17:05.099
- with this Olivia girl.
- I didn't trust her from the jump.

17:05.119 --> 17:07.520
Then look into her.
We got to get that ho

17:07.550 --> 17:08.659
away from Alex before she starts

17:08.660 --> 17:10.680
wearing your girlfriend
like a jacket,

17:10.720 --> 17:12.960
'cause that's the
type of vibe she got.

17:15.040 --> 17:17.540
Cott,

17:17.609 --> 17:19.940
I've had people looking
for your mama all day.

17:20.010 --> 17:22.480
Cotton, have you heard anything?

17:23.680 --> 17:25.680
She's fine.

17:25.750 --> 17:28.680
She was at a coffee shop, some
white lady called the cops.

17:28.750 --> 17:30.050
She freaked out.

17:30.120 --> 17:31.480
They arrested her
ass, didn't they?

17:31.500 --> 17:34.060
They put a 5150 on her at
Saint Paul's Hospital.

17:34.160 --> 17:35.339
Damn.

17:35.340 --> 17:36.999
They always trying
to find new ways

17:37.000 --> 17:38.639
to lock a bitch up.

17:38.640 --> 17:40.660
But you know what? This might
be good for your mama,

17:40.680 --> 17:42.060
'cause she's been
trippin' lately.

17:42.130 --> 17:44.460
She said the same
thing about you.

17:46.740 --> 17:49.280
Look, I just wish I could
find a way to help her,

17:49.300 --> 17:51.510
but you know she's not
asking nobody for no help.

17:51.580 --> 17:54.040
Even when she was 12, when
Mama was out trappin',

17:54.110 --> 17:55.839
she damn near ran the house.

17:55.840 --> 17:57.840
Even had Daddy taking orders.

17:58.720 --> 18:02.180
She was the only one he paid
attention to, anyway, so...

18:02.340 --> 18:04.600
- Cassie, you got a minute?
- Not now, Maurice.

18:04.620 --> 18:06.490
I'm talking to my niece.

18:06.560 --> 18:09.760
No, I got to go
check on the salon.

18:09.830 --> 18:11.890
Cott, you okay?

18:13.700 --> 18:17.070
I just got an interesting call
from Mateo at Gravity Media.

18:17.130 --> 18:19.199
He's looking for a big name

18:19.200 --> 18:20.940
to hook a sponsor for
his winter festival.

18:21.040 --> 18:23.040
- Hmm.
- He doesn't think Take 3 is big enough.

18:23.060 --> 18:24.140
So he wants Noah?

18:24.210 --> 18:25.940
I told him we'd consider.

18:25.980 --> 18:29.620
In return, he guarantees Noah's
headlining for the R&B fest.

18:29.660 --> 18:30.980
Tell him no.

18:31.050 --> 18:32.720
Uh, what do you mean "no"?

18:32.780 --> 18:35.780
We get Noah headlining, we can
start making bigger moves.

18:35.850 --> 18:37.550
We already took her
biggest artist.

18:37.620 --> 18:39.860
Now we could take
her festival, too.

18:39.920 --> 18:41.620
Maurice, I need you to chill.

18:41.690 --> 18:44.660
Okay, she is my blood, and
you better watch your back

18:44.680 --> 18:46.400
before you find
yours on the floor.

18:46.460 --> 18:48.430
And that's not a threat.

18:48.500 --> 18:50.880
Ask about me.

18:53.700 --> 18:55.320
You went to Derek about Olivia?

18:55.360 --> 18:56.786
Yeah, because you
don't know the girl.

18:56.810 --> 18:58.440
I know that her
sister just died,

18:58.480 --> 19:00.750
and she's going through a very
emotional time right now.

19:00.780 --> 19:03.270
- Why don't you get that?
- Yeah, but that bitch hijacked

19:03.280 --> 19:05.450
your first solo performance,
and you didn't even blink.

19:05.520 --> 19:07.396
Yeah, well, that's not the
first time that's happened.

19:07.420 --> 19:08.700
And I checked her for that.

19:08.740 --> 19:11.000
Okay. Well, you reacted very
differently, didn't you?

19:11.020 --> 19:12.490
So obviously, she's
in your head.

19:12.560 --> 19:15.459
She is grieving, just
like Carlotta is.

19:15.460 --> 19:18.330
All right. Before you say
anything, we're rehearsing.

19:18.400 --> 19:20.210
We just had to switch up
some of the choreography.

19:20.220 --> 19:21.220
Forget about the performance.

19:21.230 --> 19:22.499
- It got chopped.
- What?

19:22.500 --> 19:24.470
Straight Ricky Martin says
he doesn't need Take 3

19:24.480 --> 19:25.500
to land the sponsor.

19:25.600 --> 19:27.940
He has somebody bigger...
Noah Brooks.

19:28.010 --> 19:29.840
You have got to be kidding me.

19:29.910 --> 19:32.150
So they're taking us out of
Rhythm & Bells, too, or what?

19:32.180 --> 19:34.950
I don't know. Mateo's
taking over the event.

19:34.980 --> 19:36.680
He says he can handle
the sponsor himself,

19:36.750 --> 19:38.280
and he knows about Carlotta.

19:38.350 --> 19:40.080
How did he find out about that?

19:40.240 --> 19:42.800
Only Satan knows.

19:44.340 --> 19:46.390
Uh, let me call you back.

19:46.560 --> 19:48.590
Simone, how's Carlotta?

19:48.660 --> 19:50.130
What do you mean,
"How's Carlotta?"

19:50.190 --> 19:52.290
How did Mateo figure
out about her?

19:52.360 --> 19:54.600
- What did he do?
- Don't act like you don't know.

19:54.670 --> 19:57.440
I know y'all are a team.
I trusted you.

19:57.480 --> 19:58.880
I thought that we were friends.

19:58.940 --> 20:00.470
Mateo's my husband,

20:00.540 --> 20:02.080
and you're my artist.

20:02.270 --> 20:04.370
Right.

20:10.550 --> 20:12.330
I didn't threaten her baby.

20:12.340 --> 20:13.450
I told her to be careful

20:13.520 --> 20:15.180
because she was getting
herself worked up.

20:15.220 --> 20:17.860
Look, I'm really not here to
play she-said, she-said, Olivia.

20:17.900 --> 20:19.760
She's jealous of our friendship.

20:19.790 --> 20:21.260
She's probably lonely.

20:21.330 --> 20:23.360
I mean, the real is,
nobody likes her,

20:23.390 --> 20:24.679
not even her sister.

20:24.680 --> 20:26.330
Yeah, well, that's Star.

20:26.400 --> 20:27.880
Okay, she is who she is.

20:27.900 --> 20:29.970
And no matter how complicated
it is between us,

20:30.030 --> 20:32.940
you have got to respect
her, both of them,

20:33.000 --> 20:35.380
or we just can't
hang out anymore.

20:38.440 --> 20:42.479
I was wrong. Okay? I admit it.

20:42.480 --> 20:45.180
Look, I get we both
have a lot going on.

20:45.480 --> 20:48.680
So maybe you should just spend
some time with your family.

20:48.750 --> 20:52.920
Since you're not
performing anymore,

20:53.040 --> 20:54.920
maybe you could come, too.

20:54.990 --> 20:57.990
Meet my mom. Tell her about
your last conversation

20:58.000 --> 21:00.360
with Bianca. We
could go tonight.

21:00.400 --> 21:02.430
I'm...

21:02.470 --> 21:04.870
Yeah, sure.

21:04.900 --> 21:06.900
Yeah, I'd love that.

21:08.040 --> 21:10.210
Oh, okay.

21:16.010 --> 21:17.950
Ms. Brown. You awake?

21:18.020 --> 21:20.200
You have another visitor.

21:20.220 --> 21:22.880
I don't want to see
no more visitors.

21:22.920 --> 21:25.000
So tell Christine
Brown to leave?

21:25.190 --> 21:27.560
No, you can let her in.

21:31.630 --> 21:33.630
Nurse, get her out of here.

21:33.660 --> 21:36.030
Wait.

21:36.100 --> 21:37.446
- What happened to your hand?
- Don't...

21:37.470 --> 21:38.970
I'd rather let the devil himself

21:39.040 --> 21:41.570
sit on this bed before
I let your ass.

21:41.610 --> 21:44.110
You're my sister.

21:44.170 --> 21:46.140
I don't care what's going on.

21:46.180 --> 21:48.180
They told me they had
you up here on a hold.

21:48.250 --> 21:50.380
I just came to lay
my eyes on you.

21:50.450 --> 21:52.950
Well, now you see me. Now go.

21:53.940 --> 21:56.420
Nobody's ever seen
you like this.

21:56.490 --> 21:58.990
But I remember when Daddy left,

21:59.000 --> 22:01.320
- you ran away...
- I'm not doing this with you.

22:01.390 --> 22:03.990
Now go. Get out!

22:04.060 --> 22:05.576
- Get her ass out of here!
- All right!

22:05.600 --> 22:07.730
I'm-a go.

22:25.960 --> 22:27.299
You must be off the wagon,

22:27.300 --> 22:28.880
'cause you done lost
your damn mind.

22:28.930 --> 22:30.126
How the hell you gonna
work with Mateo

22:30.150 --> 22:31.520
while Carlotta down like this?

22:31.630 --> 22:33.400
Partly because you
left her high and dry.

22:33.420 --> 22:34.500
What are you talking about?

22:34.700 --> 22:36.230
Carlotta in the hospital.

22:36.300 --> 22:38.080
We were all trying to save

22:38.100 --> 22:40.270
this festival 'cause that's
what family do for family.

22:40.340 --> 22:41.979
I know your daddy
messed you up good,

22:41.980 --> 22:43.220
but that ain't what
we do around here.

22:43.240 --> 22:45.820
What happened to Carlotta?
I-I didn't know.

22:45.860 --> 22:48.130
Probably 'cause you were busy
worrying about yourself.

22:48.880 --> 22:50.640
Sober don't mean selfish.

22:53.350 --> 22:55.390
W-Wait.

23:01.290 --> 23:04.040
What can I do?

23:20.160 --> 23:22.000
I just got Noah a
headlining spot

23:22.040 --> 23:23.740
in the biggest
festival in Atlanta.

23:23.780 --> 23:25.220
I'll have my client
sign the deal

23:25.280 --> 23:26.720
- first thing tomorrow.
- Good.

23:26.790 --> 23:28.900
Mateo also asked me to
come on as a consultant

23:28.920 --> 23:30.749
for the festival.
So let's celebrate.

23:30.750 --> 23:32.680
Let me get you a drink.
Still sauvignon blanc?

23:32.890 --> 23:35.120
Jack, straight up.

23:35.160 --> 23:37.860
But not tonight.

23:38.130 --> 23:41.100
Yeah, maybe next time.

23:41.270 --> 23:44.420
Didn't I tell you where your
blood would fall, bitch?

23:44.500 --> 23:46.500
Listen, I ain't nobody's bitch.

23:46.570 --> 23:49.380
Second, I know you not
gonna shoot me in here.

23:49.480 --> 23:52.000
Now, I just got our artist into
the biggest music festival

23:52.040 --> 23:53.610
in Atlanta. Maybe it's time

23:53.620 --> 23:56.020
you start thinking about who's
really running things in here.

23:56.740 --> 23:58.580
Enjoy the show, Cassie.

24:04.780 --> 24:08.420
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

24:08.490 --> 24:10.390
I want to thank everybody.

24:10.460 --> 24:11.860
Thank you so much for being
here tonight, y'all.

24:11.880 --> 24:14.580
I want to send a special
shout-out to Chris Mackey.

24:14.720 --> 24:17.740
That's why you see me in this
full Bling Lifestyle gear.

24:17.760 --> 24:19.870
Give it up for Chris Mackey.
Yeah, yeah.

24:19.900 --> 24:21.900
Appreciate you, brother.

24:21.970 --> 24:24.330
- Where is Alex?
- A'ight, now let's kick this night off...

24:24.340 --> 24:25.380
I don't know. I
tried calling her.

24:25.390 --> 24:26.926
- She's not answering her phone.
- Ladies and gentlemen,

24:26.950 --> 24:28.860
give it up for Take 3.

24:31.420 --> 24:33.260
Yes.

24:37.760 --> 24:40.340
- Where's Alex?
- Just keep it going.

24:40.540 --> 24:41.890
Tonight is very special.

24:41.960 --> 24:45.799
We'd like to dedicate
it to Carlotta Brown.

24:45.800 --> 24:48.300
Ms. Carlotta couldn't make
it with us here tonight.

24:48.370 --> 24:49.900
But none of us would be here

24:49.930 --> 24:51.630
without her, so we
want to make sure

24:51.640 --> 24:54.360
tonight is poppin' for
Carlotta, all right?

I thought Alex was with y'all.

27:03.230 --> 27:04.750
- She ain't been answering her phone.
- No.

27:04.770 --> 27:06.550
And I think she's still
with the Olivia bitch.

27:06.570 --> 27:08.740
- I told you to look into her.
- I did.

27:08.770 --> 27:10.050
All I got was her
parents' number,

27:10.070 --> 27:11.570
- so...
- Did you call them?

27:11.640 --> 27:13.540
- Call them.

This is Derek. Alex
Crane's boyfriend.

27:20.280 --> 27:23.050
Oh, Alex, yes. She's
been so generous,

27:23.080 --> 27:25.520
the way she's reached out.

27:25.590 --> 27:27.370
Yeah, we were just trying
to get ahold of her.

27:27.390 --> 27:29.460
I know she was going over
there with Olivia today.

27:29.520 --> 27:31.360
- Olivia?
- Bianca's sister?

27:31.420 --> 27:33.230
Olivia is not Bianca's sister.

27:33.300 --> 27:35.220
She tried to hurt my daughter.

27:35.240 --> 27:36.680
You better stay away
from her, baby.

27:43.440 --> 27:45.380

28:09.500 --> 28:11.730
Jahil.

Who you gonna kill next, huh?

28:16.140 --> 28:18.620
I didn't kill Andy.

28:18.910 --> 28:20.820
I swear to God!

You got to give it to me.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.439
You don't have to
be the big sister

28:31.440 --> 28:33.440
you were when Daddy left.

28:35.660 --> 28:38.040
You don't even know
who your daddy is.

28:38.200 --> 28:40.660
I know he loved you
more than he loved me.

28:42.000 --> 28:43.840
And Mama, too.

28:45.360 --> 28:48.640
I'm good. You can go now.

28:50.880 --> 28:52.660
You're not good.

28:52.720 --> 28:54.390
Look, me and Maurice
ain't gonna fight you

28:54.410 --> 28:56.140
while you're down like this.

28:56.180 --> 28:58.180
We need you on
your "A" so we can

28:58.220 --> 29:00.240
whup your ass that way.

29:11.840 --> 29:14.480
Come on.

29:14.550 --> 29:16.950
I want to show you some
of Bianca's things.

29:17.020 --> 29:18.196
Um...

29:18.220 --> 29:19.620
where are your parents?

29:19.690 --> 29:20.879
They're not home.

29:20.880 --> 29:23.360
- Where's my pizzas?
- Shut up!

29:23.420 --> 29:24.479
That's just my aunt.

29:24.480 --> 29:26.900
You care more for that damn
iguana than you do for me.

29:26.920 --> 29:28.110
Just stay here.

29:28.130 --> 29:30.090
I'll be right back.

29:32.570 --> 29:34.610
- Who the hell is this?
- Don't worry about it!

29:50.850 --> 29:53.490
I have to get out of here.

29:54.520 --> 29:56.320
Are you looking for something?
