The eclipse
is less than a week away.

19:56.737 --> 19:57.988
- I'm not leaving Miami.

19:58.071 --> 19:59.448
I just can't work
in this school.

19:59.531 --> 20:01.450
I don't have the Council's
protection anymore.

20:01.533 --> 20:02.451
- I-I don't know
what that means.

20:02.534 --> 20:05.245
- It means the principal
can get to me,

20:05.329 --> 20:06.872
turn me into a houseplant,
a frog,

20:06.955 --> 20:07.456
transport me to the moon.

20:07.539 --> 20:09.541
- Cool.

20:09.625 --> 20:11.335
I mean, oh, no.

20:13.086 --> 20:15.255
- Listen, Andi.

20:15.339 --> 20:16.965
There's something
you should know

20:17.049 --> 20:18.842
in case I go missing.

20:18.926 --> 20:20.886
The principal
isn't just any witch.

20:20.969 --> 20:23.972
The principal is a Chosen One.

20:24.056 --> 20:26.308
- Wait. I thought Emma
was the Chosen One.

20:26.391 --> 20:30.145
- She is.
It's complicated.

20:30.228 --> 20:31.980
At first,
I thought the principal

20:32.064 --> 20:34.316
was just a disgraced witch
that had managed

20:34.399 --> 20:36.193
to steal her powers back
little by little,

20:36.276 --> 20:38.779
but she's much more than that.

20:38.862 --> 20:40.113
- But th-then they should be
sending extra Guardians,

20:40.197 --> 20:42.824
not taking her only one away.

20:58.632 --> 20:59.257
Hello, Lily.

21:02.719 --> 21:03.387
Going somewhere?

21:09.142 --> 21:11.186
Leaving us so soon?

21:11.269 --> 21:12.980
And without giving
two weeks' notice.

21:13.063 --> 21:16.024
Not very professional of you...

21:16.108 --> 21:17.442
as a nurse

21:17.526 --> 21:18.235
or a Guardian.

21:18.318 --> 21:19.528
- So you know.
- Yes.

21:19.611 --> 21:22.280
And my son tells me
you went to see the Council.

21:22.364 --> 21:23.782
- I did, and I told them
who you are.

21:23.865 --> 21:25.909
- Oh, and let me guess.

21:25.993 --> 21:27.869
The Council told you
to stay away.

21:27.953 --> 21:29.955
- They're wrong.
- It's the rules.

21:30.038 --> 21:32.582
There can be
only one Chosen One.

21:32.666 --> 21:33.875
Hence the name "Chosen One."

21:33.959 --> 21:35.752
- It's not you.

21:35.836 --> 21:37.379
- Maddie Van Pelt
has my powers,

21:37.462 --> 21:39.506
and I will get them back.

21:39.589 --> 21:40.590
- I'll stop you.
I--

21:40.674 --> 21:42.384
- Oh, is that right?

21:42.467 --> 21:45.137
You and your army of flies?

21:45.220 --> 21:46.221
[laughs]

21:46.304 --> 21:47.764
- I don't get it.

21:52.561 --> 21:54.563
