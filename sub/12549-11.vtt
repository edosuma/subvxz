WEBVTT

00:07.038 --> 00:08.339
PREVIOUSLY ON "TWISTED"...

00:08.339 --> 00:10.181
- WHY WOULD I POISON YOU?
- I TOOK YOUR POSITION.

00:10.181 --> 00:11.782
- THIS IS BECAUSE OF ARCHIE.
- GONNA ACCUSE MY CAPTAIN NOW?

00:11.782 --> 00:13.784
CAN'T YOU
LET ME OFF THE HOOK?
LIFE AT THIS SCHOOL

00:13.784 --> 00:16.287
IS JUST SO MUCH
MORE INTERESTING
WITH YOU IN IT.

00:16.287 --> 00:19.019
IT SEEMS THE CRANE INVESTIGATION
HAS GONE A LITTLE OFF COURSE

00:19.019 --> 00:21.752
AND I THINK MARILYN HERE
CAN REALLY HELP US OUT.

00:21.752 --> 00:23.594
SHOW ME EVERYTHING
YOU HAVE ON DANNY DESAI.

00:23.594 --> 00:26.157
LAST ONE TO SPEAK
IS JO MASTERSON.

00:26.157 --> 00:28.459
HOW COULD
HE BE THIS BAD PERSON,
IF I'M FALLING--

00:28.459 --> 00:31.302
JO, ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID--
OUR RELATIONSHIP--

00:31.302 --> 00:34.165
IT'S VERY SPECIAL.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
I WOULD DO WITHOUT IT.

00:34.165 --> 00:37.308
I'M SO SORRY.
THE SCHOOL BOARD HAS DECIDED
TO UPHOLD THE EXPULSION.

00:37.308 --> 00:39.640
IT'S HARD TO LET GO,
ESPECIALLY SINCE I'M
IN LOVE WITH HIM.

00:39.640 --> 00:41.242
- OH, WOW.
- I HOPE YOU KNOW

00:41.242 --> 00:43.644
I NEVER WOULD'VE DATED HIM
WITHOUT TALKING TO YOU FIRST.

00:43.644 --> 00:45.316
SOMEONE HAS A VIDEO
OF YOU AND DANNY HOOKING UP.

00:45.316 --> 00:47.078
NOW HE'S SENDING IT
OUT TO PEOPLE!

00:47.078 --> 00:48.649
Lacey:
IF IT MAKES IT
TO MY FRIENDS, THEN SO BE IT.

00:48.649 --> 00:50.751
- THEY'LL FORGIVE ME.
- Rico: YEAH, BUT JO MIGHT NOT!

00:52.823 --> 00:56.187
- ( chattering )
- HEY. HEY HEY HEY HEY.

00:56.187 --> 00:57.428
I KNOW.
HERE SHE COMES.

01:03.094 --> 01:04.795
- THERE'S LACEY.
- ( laughter )

01:04.795 --> 01:05.836
( camera phone clicking )

01:08.068 --> 01:09.640
WAIT, LOOK,
THERE SHE IS.

01:14.175 --> 01:17.648
- ♪ WHEN DID I START
TO DISCOVER... ♪
- ( knocks )

01:17.648 --> 01:19.210
KNOCK KNOCK.

01:19.210 --> 01:21.452
MAN, I LOVE IT
WHEN PEOPLE SAY,
"KNOCK KNOCK,"

01:21.452 --> 01:24.455
WHEN THEY'VE ALREADY
KNOCKED AND COME IN.
IT'S SUCH A WEIRD THING.

01:24.455 --> 01:25.816
WOW. SOMEONE'S
IN A GREAT MOOD.

01:25.816 --> 01:29.290
SORRY. I'M SICK
AND I'M STAYING HOME.

01:30.561 --> 01:32.863
- DIDN'T MOM TELL YOU?
- YEAH, SHE TOLD ME.

01:35.196 --> 01:38.499
JO, I KNOW
YOU'RE UPSET THAT DANNY
IS GETTING EXPELLED,

01:38.499 --> 01:40.131
BUT I THINK
HE'S GONNA BE OKAY.

01:41.172 --> 01:42.473
I'M SURE HE WILL.

01:44.135 --> 01:46.777
I HEARD ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID
AT THE SCHOOL BOARD HEARING.

01:46.777 --> 01:48.339
I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

01:50.110 --> 01:51.882
OKAY, WE DON'T HAVE
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

01:53.284 --> 01:54.515
YOU WANNA HEAR
ABOUT MY FIRST CRUSH?

01:54.515 --> 01:56.187
REALLY DON'T.

01:57.188 --> 01:58.889
THANKS, DAD.
I JUST...

02:00.521 --> 02:01.652
JUST THINK I NEED A DAY.

02:03.324 --> 02:05.726
- IS THAT ALL RIGHT?
- COURSE IT IS.

02:13.864 --> 02:14.865
( door closes )

02:16.136 --> 02:18.169
Danny:
WELL, THAT PROBATION OFFICER

02:18.169 --> 02:20.411
WAS BARREL OF LAUGHS, HUH?

02:20.411 --> 02:22.573
I DON'T KNOW HOW
YOU CAN MAKE JOKES
AFTER WHAT HE SAID.

02:22.573 --> 02:24.415
WE CAN'T AFFORD
PRIVATE SCHOOL.

02:24.415 --> 02:26.217
WE CAN BARELY AFFORD
GROCERIES.

02:26.217 --> 02:28.519
( sighs )
THAT'S A LITTLE MELODRAMATIC,
DON'T YOU THINK?

02:28.519 --> 02:30.551
WELL, IF WE DON'T FIND
ANOTHER SCHOOL FOR YOU SOON,

02:30.551 --> 02:32.523
YOU'LL BE IN VIOLATION
OF YOUR PROBATION.

02:32.523 --> 02:35.926
THEN YOU'LL BE BACK IN JUVIE.
HOW'S THAT FOR MELODRAMA?

02:39.290 --> 02:40.891
I'M SORRY.

02:40.891 --> 02:42.533
I'M JUST TIRED

02:42.533 --> 02:43.594
AND I'M LATE FOR WORK.

02:43.594 --> 02:45.366
IT'S OKAY.

02:45.366 --> 02:47.768
I CAN GET A JOB TOO,
YOU KNOW.

02:47.768 --> 02:50.901
HELP OUT AT LEAST WE FIND
A SCHOOL THAT WILL ADMIT ME

02:50.901 --> 02:52.903
AND THEN WE CAN APPLY
FOR FINANCIAL AID.

02:52.903 --> 02:54.805
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

02:54.805 --> 02:57.208
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE
THE ONE SAYING THAT TO YOU.

02:58.409 --> 03:00.611
I WONDER WHAT
YOUR FATHER WOULD SAY
IF HE COULD SEE US NOW.

03:00.611 --> 03:03.214
AH. HE'D PROBABLY
CRACK SOME JOKE

03:03.214 --> 03:05.486
ABOUT HOW WE SHOULD ROB
A BANK OR SOMETHING.

03:05.486 --> 03:06.917
WELL, THAT SOUNDS
ABOUT RIGHT.

03:09.360 --> 03:10.961
( kisses )

03:17.228 --> 03:20.200
- ( sighs )
- ( clicking )

03:35.916 --> 03:38.919
( sighs )

03:38.919 --> 03:41.792
( chattering )

03:41.792 --> 03:43.754
( phone buzzes )

03:56.267 --> 03:58.709
I CAN'T BELIEVE
SHE SCRATCHED ME.

03:58.709 --> 04:00.641
IF IT LEAVES A SCAR,
I'M SUING.

04:00.641 --> 04:02.743
Lacey: I CAN'T BELIEVE
I MISSED THAT FIGHT.
IT SOUNDS AMAZING.

04:02.743 --> 04:03.974
IT WAS AMAZING.

04:03.974 --> 04:06.777
EVEN AS I WAS
BEING ATTACKED,
I WAS THINKING,

04:06.777 --> 04:09.320
"THIS IS AN AMAZING STORY
I'LL TELL MY GRANDKIDS ONE DAY."

04:09.320 --> 04:11.852
IT GAVE ME SOME SOLACE
WHILE I WAS BLEEDING OUT.

04:11.852 --> 04:12.953
YOU'RE REALLY GONNA
TELL YOUR GRANDKIDS

04:12.953 --> 04:15.556
YOU LOST A FIGHT
TO PHOEBE?

04:15.556 --> 04:17.928
I DIDN'T LOSE.
SHE SURPRISED ME.

04:17.928 --> 04:20.491
YEAH, WE TOLD YOU
PHOEBE WAS NUTS.

04:20.491 --> 04:23.263
Regina:
FINE. YOU WERE RIGHT,
I WAS WRONG.

04:23.263 --> 04:25.966
PLEASE JUST PROMISE ME
WE NEVER HAVE TO TALK
TO HER AGAIN.

04:27.868 --> 04:29.840
- FINE BY ME.
- I'M COOL WITH THAT.

04:29.840 --> 04:30.841
Regina: THANKS.

04:51.021 --> 04:53.023
( theme music playing )

04:58.699 --> 05:00.571
- IT IS, THOUGH.
- NO, IT'S NOT.

05:00.571 --> 05:02.433
- THAT'S WHAT IT BOILS
DOWN TO. YEAH.
- I KNOW.

05:02.433 --> 05:05.005
ARCHIE, CAN WE TALK
FOR A SECOND?

05:05.005 --> 05:07.678
HEY, DON'T YOU HAVE A MURDERER
TO ROLL AROUND WITH?

05:07.678 --> 05:09.810
- ( laughter )
- YOU KNOW, LIKE ON A BED?

05:09.810 --> 05:10.881
SCOTT.

05:14.815 --> 05:15.986
OH MAN.

05:17.418 --> 05:18.949
( sighs ) THANKS.

05:20.391 --> 05:21.652
WHAT DO YOU WANT, LACEY?

05:22.693 --> 05:24.395
NOTHING.
I JUST WANTED YOU TO KNOW

05:24.395 --> 05:27.828
THAT I'M SORRY.
WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN
DANNY AND ME WAS...

05:28.929 --> 05:31.562
- I WAS CONFUSED.
- WHEN DID IT START?

05:32.863 --> 05:35.506
I REMEMBER YOU SNEAKING OFF
AT THE CEMETERY PARTY.

05:35.506 --> 05:37.107
YOU WERE HOOKING UP WITH HIM
THE WHOLE TIME, WEREN'T YOU?

05:37.107 --> 05:40.671
NO. I BROKE UP WITH YOU
BEFORE ANYTHING HAPPENED...

05:40.671 --> 05:42.042
MOSTLY.

05:43.013 --> 05:44.815
I DON'T EXPECT YOU
TO FORGIVE ME.

05:47.718 --> 05:50.651
I HEARD YOU GUYS
GOT INTO REGIONALS.

05:50.651 --> 05:52.953
- YUP.
- CONGRATS, ARCH.

05:56.427 --> 05:58.559
YOU GUYS CELEBRATING?

05:58.559 --> 06:00.861
WE RENTED OUT JOHNNY CAKES.

06:00.861 --> 06:03.594
WE'RE HAVING...
A PRIVATE PARTY.

06:07.438 --> 06:09.640
OKAY.
WELL, SEE YOU LATER.

06:14.975 --> 06:17.578
I BROUGHT YOU SOME STUFF
TO HELP CHEER YOU UP.

06:17.578 --> 06:20.481
I HAVE A, UH,
ENGLISH ESSAY ASSIGNMENT,

06:20.481 --> 06:23.884
CHEMISTRY PROBLEM SET
AND HISTORY STUDY SHEET.

06:23.884 --> 06:26.487
- SO...
- VERY THOUGHTFUL, RICO.
THANK YOU.

06:26.487 --> 06:27.818
SURE.

06:27.818 --> 06:30.421
SO HOW ARE YOU HOLDING UP?

06:31.662 --> 06:33.794
FINE. I JUST NEEDED
A DAY TO SHAKE IT OFF.

06:33.794 --> 06:34.965
BUT I'M FINE NOW.

06:34.965 --> 06:37.868
LACEY AND DANNY
CAN HAVE EACH OTHER.

06:37.868 --> 06:40.871
YEAH, I DON'T--
I DON'T THINK LACEY AND DANNY
ARE STILL GOING OUT.

06:40.871 --> 06:42.873
LACEY'S HAD
A PRETTY ROUGH DAY.

06:42.873 --> 06:44.435
SOMEONE VANDALIZED
HER LOCKER, SO...

06:44.435 --> 06:46.737
SEEMS LIKE THAT VIDEO REALLY
MESSED UP HER LIFE A LOT.

06:48.909 --> 06:50.180
- ( clears throat )
- LACEY'S NOT MY PROBLEM
ANYMORE.

06:50.180 --> 06:51.982
I'M NOT INTERESTED
IN BEING FRIENDS WITH SOMEONE

06:51.982 --> 06:53.914
WHO KEEPS THINGS FROM ME.

06:55.015 --> 06:56.887
YEAH, TOTALLY.
OF COURSE.

06:56.887 --> 06:59.850
- YEAH.
- I'M JUST SICK OF THINKING
ABOUT LACEY AND DANNY.

06:59.850 --> 07:02.422
JUST--
IT'S ALL SO EXHAUSTING.

07:03.454 --> 07:04.625
TIME TO LOOK FORWARD.

07:04.625 --> 07:06.857
RIGHT, YEAH,
LET'S LOOK FORWARD,

07:06.857 --> 07:08.799
BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK BACK,
THAT'S WHEN YOU,

07:08.799 --> 07:11.862
YOU KNOW, TRIP OVER STUFF

07:11.862 --> 07:14.705
THAT'S, LIKE,
AHEAD OF YOU.

07:14.705 --> 07:17.007
UH... OKAY, I'M SORRY.

07:17.007 --> 07:19.840
- I'LL-- I'LL JUST
STOP NOW. SORRY.
- ( laughter )

07:19.840 --> 07:21.812
- PLEASE DO.
- ( groans )

07:27.848 --> 07:30.050
THIS THING IS
PRETTY GRIMY, LACEY.

07:30.050 --> 07:32.523
HAVE YOU WASHED IT
SINCE THAT TRIP
TO CONNECTICUT?

07:32.523 --> 07:34.054
YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE.
YOU COULD GET INTO TROUBLE.

07:34.054 --> 07:36.186
WHAT ARE THEY GONNA DO?
THEY GONNA EXPEL ME AGAIN?

07:36.186 --> 07:38.058
( chuckles )

07:38.058 --> 07:39.990
I JUST WANTED
TO SEE HOW YOU WERE.

07:39.990 --> 07:41.962
ME? I'M GREAT.

07:41.962 --> 07:43.964
NO ONE WILL GET
WITHIN 10 FEET OF ME.

07:43.964 --> 07:46.797
MY FRIENDS ARE
FREEZING ME OUT.
GOOD TIMES.

07:46.797 --> 07:49.800
LACEY, LOOK,
I'M SO SORRY
ABOUT ALL THIS.

07:49.800 --> 07:51.902
- I FEEL RESPONSIBLE.
- YOU'RE NOT.

07:52.943 --> 07:54.845
I MADE
MY OWN BAD DECISIONS.

07:56.747 --> 07:58.048
HAVE YOU, UMM--

07:58.048 --> 07:59.950
HAVE YOU TALKED TO JO?

08:01.011 --> 08:02.513
SHE DIDN'T COME
TO SCHOOL TODAY.

08:04.014 --> 08:06.486
BELIEVE ME, SHE'S NOT GONNA
WANNA TALK TO US FOR A WHILE,

08:06.486 --> 08:08.919
ESPECIALLY AFTER WHAT SHE SAID
AT THE SCHOOL BOARD HEARING.

08:08.919 --> 08:11.562
- YOU HEARD ABOUT THAT, HUH?
- I SAW HER RIGHT AFTER.

08:11.562 --> 08:14.024
SHE TOLD ME, DANNY.
SHE SAID SHE WAS
IN LOVE WITH YOU.

08:16.897 --> 08:17.998
I GOTTA GO
MAKE THIS RIGHT.

08:17.998 --> 08:20.030
YOU CAN'T MAKE IT RIGHT.
SHE'S HURTING.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.934
SHE'S EMBARRASSED.
SHE JUST NEEDS SOME SPACE.

08:23.934 --> 08:25.606
I CAN'T. I CAN'T.

08:25.606 --> 08:28.979
JUST... THE IDEA
OF HER SITTING THERE
AT HOME, ALL...

08:30.741 --> 08:32.543
I'M GONNA GO
OVER THERE RIGHT NOW,

08:32.543 --> 08:34.284
- AND I WANT YOU
TO COME WITH ME.
- DANNY, I DON'T THINK--

08:34.284 --> 08:36.016
DON'T YOU WANT HER
TO FORGIVE YOU?

08:36.016 --> 08:37.618
- OF COURSE I DO.
- OKAY.

08:37.618 --> 08:39.920
THEN COME WITH ME.
IF WE CAN EXPLAIN TO HER

08:39.920 --> 08:42.022
THAT THERE'S NOTHING
GOING ON BETWEEN US ANYMORE,

08:42.022 --> 08:45.195
THEN MAYBE ALL OF US
CAN GET PAST THIS.

08:45.195 --> 08:47.157
IT'S WORTH A SHOT, RIGHT?

08:48.959 --> 08:51.862
CHIEF MASTERSON,
IT IS NOT PERSONAL.

08:51.862 --> 08:54.134
I'M MERELY
RETRACING YOUR STEPS TO SEE
IF YOU MISSED ANYTHING.

08:54.134 --> 08:55.936
WE SEARCHED THE POND
MULTIPLE TIMES.

08:55.936 --> 08:59.610
IT WAS VERY COSTLY
AND TOOK A LOT OUT
OF OUR LIMITED RESOURCES.

08:59.610 --> 09:01.672
SEARCHING IT AGAIN
IS NOT GONNA HELP
SOLVE THIS CASE.

09:01.672 --> 09:04.544
BUT CONTINUING TO DIG
INTO MISSING PAPERWORK
AT CITY HALL WILL?

09:04.544 --> 09:07.277
I OVERHEARD
OFFICER GARRETT ALL MORNING

09:07.277 --> 09:09.680
CALLING CITY HALL,
LOCAL REALTORS,

09:09.680 --> 09:11.722
A LAWYER
FROM VIKRAM DESAI'S ESTATE.

09:12.923 --> 09:14.284
MARNA INC.?

09:14.284 --> 09:16.326
MISS ROSSI, IF I MAY.

09:16.326 --> 09:18.659
MARNA INC. IS CONNECTED
TO VIKRAM DESAI.

09:18.659 --> 09:21.992
- WHO DIED SIX MONTHS AGO.
- YES, BUT THIS COMPANY

09:21.992 --> 09:24.334
IS LINKED TO MONEY
THAT WAS SENT TO THE VICTIM
TWO DAYS BEFORE SHE WAS--

09:24.334 --> 09:27.598
- SAVE YOUR BREATH, EDDIE.
- Marilyn: IT SOUNDS LIKE
A LEGITIMATE LEAD,

09:27.598 --> 09:30.270
BUT WE NEED TO REFOCUS
ON WHAT'S IN FRONT
OF US FIRST.

09:30.270 --> 09:33.704
YOU HAVE A YOUNG MAN
WHO HAS A CRIMINAL RECORD,

09:33.704 --> 09:38.248
NO ALIBI AND A TEXT MESSAGE
SENT FROM THE VICTIM HOURS
BEFORE TIME OF DEATH.

09:38.248 --> 09:40.010
IT'S NOT
THAT SIMPLE ANYMORE.

09:40.010 --> 09:42.983
WE'RE SEARCHING THE POND AGAIN.
YOU FOUND THE NECKLACE THERE.

09:42.983 --> 09:45.656
MAYBE SOMETHING ELSE
WILL TURN UP.

09:45.656 --> 09:46.987
( sighs )

09:46.987 --> 09:49.019
( police radio chatter )

09:52.663 --> 09:55.095
YOU SURE WE SHOULDN'T
TELL HER ABOUT KAREN
DUMPING THAT NECKLACE?

09:55.095 --> 09:56.667
OR THE FACT
THAT DANNY HAD IT?

09:56.667 --> 09:58.869
KAREN AND DANNY HAVE ENOUGH
ON THEIR PLATE RIGHT NOW.

09:58.869 --> 10:00.731
THEY DON'T NEED
THAT WOMAN HARASSING THEM.

10:02.272 --> 10:04.004
( knocks )

10:05.105 --> 10:07.978
HEY, RICO.
IS JO HERE?

10:07.978 --> 10:11.211
YEAH, BUT I DON'T KNOW
IF SHE WANTS TO SEE
YOU GUYS RIGHT NOW.

10:11.211 --> 10:13.083
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
- JO.

10:14.985 --> 10:17.187
- LISTEN.
- PLEASE, LET US EXPLAIN.

10:17.187 --> 10:19.089
WHAT'S THERE TO EXPLAIN?

10:19.089 --> 10:21.091
- LACEY, DANNY, HEY.
- ( door closes )

10:22.192 --> 10:25.225
DANNY, I'M SO SORRY
ABOUT THE EXPULSION.

10:25.225 --> 10:27.127
I SPOKE TO YOUR MOM
LAST NIGHT AND SHE'S JUST--

10:27.127 --> 10:28.699
THANK YOU,
MRS. MASTERSON.

10:28.699 --> 10:30.961
UH, WE'LL GET THROUGH IT.

10:30.961 --> 10:34.034
- I'LL BE OKAY.
- I'M SURE YOU WILL.

10:34.034 --> 10:36.036
I'M SURE LACEY
WILL HELP YOU BE OKAY.

10:36.036 --> 10:38.368
JO, DANNY AND I--
WE'RE OVER, OKAY?

10:38.368 --> 10:41.211
IT'S OVER. THAT VIDEO
WAS FROM BEFORE--

10:41.211 --> 10:43.243
DO YOU REALLY THINK
THAT MATTERS?

10:43.243 --> 10:47.117
YOU ARE SUCH
A HYPOCRITE, LACEY.

10:47.117 --> 10:50.120
YOU CONDEMN DANNY
FOR LYING WHILE YOU'RE OFF
DOING THE SAME THING?

10:50.120 --> 10:52.382
PLEASE DON'T--
DON'T BLAME LACEY, OKAY?

10:52.382 --> 10:54.855
IT'S ON ME.
I SHOULD'VE BEEN
THE ONE TO TELL YOU.

10:55.956 --> 10:57.988
YOU HAVE BEEN
SO SUPPORTIVE OF ME.

10:57.988 --> 11:01.792
- THE WAY THAT YOU SPOKE
OUT FOR ME YESTERDAY...
- ( inhales sharply )

11:01.792 --> 11:02.993
...IT...

11:05.665 --> 11:08.969
I AM SO SICK

11:08.969 --> 11:10.400
OF YOUR EXCUSES.

11:11.401 --> 11:13.704
YOU LIE AND APOLOGIZE

11:13.704 --> 11:16.877
AND LIE AND APOLOGIZE.
AND I'M OVER IT, DANNY.

11:16.877 --> 11:19.980
OKAY, LET'S ALL
JUST TAKE A BREATH HERE.

11:19.980 --> 11:21.712
- EMOTIONS ARE RUNNING HIGH.
- MY EMOTIONS ARE FINE.

11:21.712 --> 11:22.953
I JUST WANT
THESE TWO TO LEAVE.

11:22.953 --> 11:24.785
Lacey:
JO, WE'RE SO SORRY.

11:24.785 --> 11:28.018
WE NEVER WANTED YOU
TO FIND OUT THAT WAY.

11:28.018 --> 11:30.791
BUT JUST KNOW THAT I DID
EVERYTHING IN MY POWER

11:30.791 --> 11:32.162
TO KEEP THAT VIDEO
FROM COMING OUT.

11:32.162 --> 11:33.964
THE MINUTE
RICO TOLD ME ABOUT IT--

11:33.964 --> 11:35.295
YOU KNEW
ABOUT THAT VIDEO?

11:35.295 --> 11:37.197
LOOK, I WAS--
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO PROTECT YOU.

11:37.197 --> 11:40.130
I AM SO SICK
OF BEING PROTECTED!

11:43.473 --> 11:46.807
JUST GET OUT.
JUST GET OUT, ALL OF YOU.

11:57.417 --> 11:59.920
OH CRAP!
I FORGOT MY BACKPACK.

12:01.451 --> 12:04.194
JO'S PROBABLY BURNING IT
RIGHT NOW, ANYWAY.

12:04.194 --> 12:06.426
RICO, I DIDN'T MEAN
TO CALL YOU OUT LIKE THAT.

12:06.426 --> 12:08.428
I GUESS I CAN BUY
A NEW BACKPACK,

12:08.428 --> 12:10.160
PROBABLY
SOME NEW TEXTBOOKS.

12:10.160 --> 12:12.833
PROBABLY HAVE TO
SWITCH SCHOOLS SINCE
JO'S IN ALL MY CLASSES.

12:12.833 --> 12:14.805
DUDE, DUDE, DON'T WORRY.
SHE'LL PROBABLY FORGIVE YOU.

12:14.805 --> 12:17.337
90% OF HER WRATH WAS DIRECTED
AT ME AND LACEY, ANYWAY.

12:17.337 --> 12:18.408
W-WAIT.

12:19.409 --> 12:20.971
OH GOD. ARE YOU--
ARE YOU SAYING

12:20.971 --> 12:22.472
10% OF THAT WAS
DIRECTED TOWARDS ME?

12:22.472 --> 12:25.275
( sighs )
I NEED TO GO HOME, NOW.

12:26.276 --> 12:27.347
( running footsteps )

12:27.347 --> 12:29.449
( chuckles )
YOU WANT A RIDE?

12:29.449 --> 12:31.221
NAH, I'LL WALK.

12:31.221 --> 12:32.482
YOU GONNA BE OKAY?

12:34.484 --> 12:36.286
SURE, YOU KNOW,

12:36.286 --> 12:37.958
I HAVE
A WILD NIGHT PLANNED.

12:39.029 --> 12:41.391
I'M GONNA GO HOME,
SIT ON MY BED

12:41.391 --> 12:43.033
AND I'LL THINK
ABOUT MY FORMER FRIENDS

12:43.033 --> 12:45.165
AND HOW THEY'RE
OUT CELEBRATING
WITH THE SOCCER TEAM.

12:46.436 --> 12:48.368
YEAH, I HEARD ABOUT THAT.
THEY MADE REGIONALS, HUH?

12:48.368 --> 12:50.971
- ( sighs )
- WELL, IF YOU EVER NEED

12:50.971 --> 12:52.502
TO TALK TO SOMEBODY,
YOU JUST CALL ME.

12:54.504 --> 12:56.847
- ALL RIGHT?
- ALL RIGHT.

13:04.454 --> 13:05.455
( car door closes )

13:05.455 --> 13:06.786
( whispers )

13:08.188 --> 13:10.090
- HEY, HONEY.
- SWEETHEART.

13:10.090 --> 13:11.922
TOLD HIM
ABOUT THE VIDEO, HUH?

13:12.963 --> 13:15.195
- AWESOME.
- ( sighs )

13:15.195 --> 13:18.468
JUST REMEMBER THAT YOUR DAD
AND I ARE HERE FOR YOU

13:18.468 --> 13:20.470
AND THAT WE LOVE YOU.

13:20.470 --> 13:22.372
OKAY, THIS JUST GOT LAME.

13:24.534 --> 13:26.076
JO, HOW ABOUT WE GO OUT?

13:26.076 --> 13:29.179
AN OLD-SCHOOL MASTERSON FAMILY
NIGHT ON THE TOWN.

13:29.179 --> 13:32.142
Tess:
"SOME LIKE IT HOT" IS PLAYING
AT THE GREEN GROVE CINEMA.

13:32.142 --> 13:35.445
- ONE WEEK ONLY.
- I'VE BEEN SO FOCUSED
ON MY CASE,

13:35.445 --> 13:38.388
YOU'VE BEEN FOCUSED ON...
YOUR STUFF.

13:38.388 --> 13:40.520
( sighs )
IT'S GONNA BE GOOD
FOR US ALL.

13:40.520 --> 13:43.423
- ( clears throat )
- COME ON, I'LL EVEN
LET YOU DECIDE

13:43.423 --> 13:45.926
HOW MUCH SALT
TO PUT ON THE POPCORN.

13:45.926 --> 13:48.458
WELL, YOU BASICALLY
PUT SO MUCH ON IT THAT
IT BECOMES INEDIBLE.

13:48.458 --> 13:52.232
- ( chuckles )
- OKAY, LET'S GO.

13:52.232 --> 13:56.106
YAY! A MASTERSON
FAMILY FUN NIGHT.

13:56.106 --> 13:57.407
AS LONG AS
YOU DON'T CALL IT THAT.

13:59.339 --> 14:02.072
I DON'T CARE WHAT THE GUY SAID.
A DEAL IS A DEAL.

14:02.072 --> 14:04.474
- ALL RIGHT?
GET BACK TO ME.
- ( phone ringing )

14:04.474 --> 14:07.317
KAREN.
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

14:07.317 --> 14:09.349
HEY, RAY, CAN I TALK
TO YOU FOR A MINUTE?

14:09.349 --> 14:11.321
PLEASE.

14:13.453 --> 14:14.925
SO, WHAT'S UP?

14:14.925 --> 14:17.187
- UH...
- HOLD IT.
YOU'RE NOT QUITTING, ARE YOU?

14:17.187 --> 14:19.429
IS IT BECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED
YESTERDAY IN THE LUNCH ROOM?

14:19.429 --> 14:21.331
KAREN, I DIDN'T MEAN
ANYTHING BY THAT.

14:21.331 --> 14:23.433
- I JUST REALLY LIKED
THAT SKIRT YOU WERE WEARING.
- ( chuckles )

14:23.433 --> 14:25.135
IT'S FINE.
I'M NOT QUITTING.

14:25.135 --> 14:28.398
I WAS ACTUALLY HOPING
I COULD TAKE ON MORE WORK.

14:28.398 --> 14:31.401
YOU KNOW,
MORE RESPONSIBILITY
AND MORE HOURS.

14:31.401 --> 14:34.104
- YOU'RE TALKING TO ME ABOUT
OVERTIME PAY, AREN'T YOU?
- ( chuckles )

14:35.445 --> 14:36.646
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

14:36.646 --> 14:38.608
I'M TRYING TO GET
A SITE UP AND RUNNING

14:38.608 --> 14:41.481
ON A NEW PROPERTY THAT'S
HITTING THE MARKET A.S.A.P.

14:41.481 --> 14:44.384
YOU KNOW HOW TO PUT TOGETHER
A VIRTUAL ONLINE TOUR?

14:44.384 --> 14:47.988
- I'LL FIGURE IT OUT.
- IT MIGHT MEAN STAYING
LATE ALL WEEK.

14:47.988 --> 14:50.020
THAT'S FINE.
I MEAN, THAT'S GREAT.

14:50.020 --> 14:52.422
- THANK YOU.
- ABSOLUTELY.

14:52.422 --> 14:54.224
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

14:59.499 --> 15:01.501
- ( people chattering )
- ( crickets chirping )

15:01.501 --> 15:04.374
I THINK YOU WERE
FIVE WHEN WE FIRST
SHOWED YOU THIS MOVIE.

15:04.374 --> 15:06.276
YOU WERE SO CONFUSED
BY ALL THE CROSS-DRESSING.

15:06.276 --> 15:08.608
YOU KEPT YELLING,
"WHY ARE ALL THE BOYS
ACTING LIKE GIRLS?"

15:08.608 --> 15:12.682
WOW. I WAS A CLOSED-MINDED
LITTLE BRAT, WASN'T I?

15:12.682 --> 15:15.445
YOU GUYS WANNA GET
SOME POPCORN BEFORE
THE LINE GETS TOO LONG?

15:15.445 --> 15:18.118
- Tess: YEAH.
- HEY.

15:18.118 --> 15:21.251
HERE TO CHECK OUT
SOME CLASSIC '50s
SCREWBALL COMEDY?

15:22.452 --> 15:24.924
- TYLER, THIS IS MY--

15:24.924 --> 15:27.097
SO NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
I LOVE THAT JACKET.

15:27.097 --> 15:29.599
AND YOU MUST BE
CHIEF MASTERSON.

15:29.599 --> 15:32.262
- IT'S AN HONOR, SIR.
- WOW, "AN HONOR."

15:32.262 --> 15:35.135
- THANK YOU, TYLER.
- YOU'RE WELCOME, SIR.

15:35.135 --> 15:37.407
ME AND MY FILM CLUB BUDDIES
ARE HEADED TO MY PLACE

15:37.407 --> 15:40.070
TO HAVE A LITTLE POST-MOVIE
BREAKDOWN ANALYSIS.

15:40.070 --> 15:41.441
WANNA JOIN?

15:41.441 --> 15:44.144
THANKS, BUT WE'RE ABOUT
TO SEE THE MOVIE, SO...

15:44.144 --> 15:46.716
- NOTHING TO DISCUSS QUITE YET.
- RIGHT, TOTALLY.

15:46.716 --> 15:50.320
WELL, TEXT ME AFTER
IF YOU WANNA COME BY, JO.

15:50.320 --> 15:53.153
CHIEF, MRS. M.,
NICE TO SEE YOU GUYS.

15:53.153 --> 15:54.384
( mouths )

15:58.588 --> 16:00.430
SO THAT GUY
WAS INTERESTING.

16:00.430 --> 16:04.164
- I THOUGHT HE WAS VERY POLITE.
- YEAH, IN A EDDIE HASKELL
KIND OF WAY.

16:04.164 --> 16:06.096
DO YOU MIND
IF I GO WITH HIM?

16:07.267 --> 16:09.139
WE HAVEN'T SEEN
THE MOVIE YET.

16:09.139 --> 16:11.471
I'VE SEEN IT
LIKE 10 TIMES.

16:11.471 --> 16:13.973
IT'S NOT LIKE I'M GONNA BE
ALONE WITH HIM OR ANYTHING.

16:13.973 --> 16:15.305
WE'LL BE IN A BIG GROUP.

16:17.447 --> 16:19.079
OKAY.
( chuckles )

16:19.079 --> 16:22.582
- DON'T BE BACK TOO LATE.
- I WON'T. THANK YOU.

16:27.287 --> 16:29.289
( music playing
over headphones )

16:31.761 --> 16:33.363
( window opens )

16:33.363 --> 16:35.195
( grunts )

16:36.466 --> 16:39.769
LACEY. HEY, IT'S FUNNY
RUNNING INTO YOU LIKE THIS.

16:39.769 --> 16:42.532
HOW'S LIFE?
( sighs )

16:42.532 --> 16:43.773
WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE, DANNY?

16:43.773 --> 16:45.435
I HEAR THAT
JOHNNY CAKES IS HOSTING

16:45.435 --> 16:47.037
A PRIVATE PARTY
FOR THE SOCCER TEAM--

16:47.037 --> 16:49.008
SOMETHING ABOUT REGIONALS.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.410
I THINK YOU SHOULD GO.

16:51.511 --> 16:52.782
- DANNY.
- LOOK...

16:52.782 --> 16:56.046
I'M THE REASON WHY
EVERYONE HATES YOU, RIGHT?

16:56.046 --> 16:59.289
SO PLEASE,
LET ME JUST TRY TO FIX THIS.

17:02.052 --> 17:04.654
I, UH-- I HAVE AN IDEA.

17:11.701 --> 17:13.733
SO YOU GUYS SAW
"SOME LIKE IT HOT"?

17:13.733 --> 17:16.366
IT'S A GREAT FILM,
REALLY BITING COMEDY.

17:16.366 --> 17:18.138
FOUND IT.
HERE YOU GO.

17:18.138 --> 17:19.809
THANKS, MRS. MASTERSON.

17:19.809 --> 17:24.314
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD TELL
JO TO CALL ME IF SHE WANTS?

17:24.314 --> 17:26.476
- YEAH.
- AND TELL HER I SAID HI.

17:26.476 --> 17:29.579
OKAY. OR ACTUALLY
TELL HER THAT I SAID HI

17:29.579 --> 17:32.282
AND THEN TO CALL ME.
IN THAT ORDER.

17:32.282 --> 17:34.584
- WE WILL, RICO.
- ( Tess clears throat )

17:36.126 --> 17:37.657
UM, RICO,
DO YOU WANNA...

17:37.657 --> 17:39.229
STAY?

17:39.229 --> 17:41.091
HANG OUT
TILL JO GETS BACK?

17:41.091 --> 17:42.762
YOU CAN TELL HER
"HI" YOURSELF.

17:42.762 --> 17:44.664
I'LL MAKE YOU
SOMETHING TO EAT.

17:44.664 --> 17:46.436
YEAH, THANKS.

17:46.436 --> 17:48.298
WHAT TIME IS
SHE SUPPOSED TO BE BACK?

17:48.298 --> 17:51.241
WHO KNOWS? SHE'S HANGING OUT
WITH THIS GUY TYLER
AND HIS FILM CLUB.

17:51.241 --> 17:54.574
- TY-- TYLER?
- SEE? RICO DOESN'T LIKE
THE GUY EITHER.

17:54.574 --> 17:58.708
( sighs )
KYLE, WE HAVE TO TRUST JO
TO MAKE THE RIGHT CHOICES.

17:58.708 --> 18:02.112
I GUESS, BUT HER TASTE IN MEN
LEAVES A LOT TO BE DESIRED.

18:02.112 --> 18:03.653
AMEN TO THAT.

18:04.714 --> 18:05.855
DID I SAY THAT OUT LOUD?

18:07.717 --> 18:09.789
- ( chattering )
- ( rock music playing )

18:13.163 --> 18:14.224
- ( door opens )
- ( bell jingles )

18:17.096 --> 18:19.199
( chattering stops )

18:20.770 --> 18:22.672
I JUST WANTED TO DROP BY
AND SAY CONGRATS AGAIN.

18:24.704 --> 18:27.807
- SO CONGRATS.
- YOU HAVE A LOT OF NERVE,

18:27.807 --> 18:29.509
SHOWING UP HERE LIKE THIS.

18:30.880 --> 18:32.812
I KNOW YOU'RE PISSED
AT ME, SARITA,

18:32.812 --> 18:34.814
BUT THE OTHER NIGHT...

18:36.186 --> 18:37.647
YOU SAID I WAS
YOUR BEST FRIEND

18:37.647 --> 18:39.889
- AND THAT NOTHING
COULD CHANGE THAT.
- THAT WAS BEFORE I KNEW

18:39.889 --> 18:41.551
YOU WERE HOOKING UP
WITH REGINA'S MURDERER.

18:41.551 --> 18:44.794
HOW THE HELL DO YOU THINK
SHE'D FEEL ABOUT ALL THIS?

18:49.829 --> 18:52.502
IT'S JUST
A LITTLE TOO SOON, OKAY?

18:52.502 --> 18:54.564
( people chattering )

18:57.437 --> 18:58.668
I'M NOT LEAVING.

18:59.739 --> 19:01.411
SUIT YOURSELF.

19:09.649 --> 19:11.651
( clicking )

19:13.723 --> 19:15.425
( whooshes )

19:18.228 --> 19:19.629
( phone chimes )

19:27.297 --> 19:30.770
AND I ALSO RESENT THE WAY
WILDER PURPORTS

19:30.770 --> 19:33.303
TO DECONSTRUCT
TRADITIONAL GENDER ROLES.

19:33.303 --> 19:35.545
IT'S CONDESCENDING.

19:35.545 --> 19:39.379
WHAT EXACTLY IS THIS FILM
TRYING TO COMMUNICATE?

19:39.379 --> 19:41.381
- MMM.
- TO CONVEY?

19:41.381 --> 19:43.283
I THINK IT'S TRYING
TO BE FUNNY.

19:43.283 --> 19:45.955
I MEAN, IT'S A COMEDY
FROM THE 1950s.

19:45.955 --> 19:48.758
( nervous chuckle )
WHAT SHOULD IT BE
TRYING TO CONVEY?

19:48.758 --> 19:50.660
- ( chuckles )
- ( soft rock music playing )

19:50.660 --> 19:54.364
♪ THIS MAY BE
THE ONLY WAY... ♪

19:54.364 --> 19:56.696
IS ANYBODY THIRSTY?

19:56.696 --> 19:59.569
'CAUSE I WAS GONNA GO GRAB
A DRINK OR SOMETHING.

19:59.569 --> 20:01.200
( softly ) OKAY.

20:02.772 --> 20:05.405
Boy: ALL RIGHT,
GUYS, LET'S START
FROM THE BEGINNING,

20:05.405 --> 20:06.836
TALK A LITTLE
BIT ABOUT...

20:06.836 --> 20:09.479
WELL PUT, JO MASTERSON.

20:11.441 --> 20:14.614
YEAH.
YOUR FILM CLUB BUDDIES...

20:15.615 --> 20:16.816
THEY'RE COOL.

20:16.816 --> 20:19.419
THEY'RE REALLY NOT,
BUT I LIKE 'EM.

20:19.419 --> 20:21.951
IT'S NICE TO HAVE FRIENDS
THAT SHARE THE SAME PASSION.

20:21.951 --> 20:24.254
SO YOU'RE REALLY SERIOUS
ABOUT THE DIRECTOR THING THEN?

20:24.254 --> 20:26.956
OH YEAH, I ALREADY PRINTED OUT
MY FILM SCHOOL APPLICATIONS.

20:26.956 --> 20:28.728
I WANNA BE
THE NEXT MICHAEL BAY.

20:28.728 --> 20:30.830
( both laugh )

20:30.830 --> 20:32.632
IT'S NICE
TO SEE YOU SMILING.

20:32.632 --> 20:36.806
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- I JUST THOUGHT YOU'D
BE DEPRESSED

20:36.806 --> 20:38.768
AFTER THAT VIDEO
OF DANNY AND LACEY.

20:38.768 --> 20:41.341
NO, WHY WOULD I BE?

20:41.341 --> 20:43.242
BECAUSE YOU HAVE A THING
FOR DANNY, RIGHT?

20:46.276 --> 20:47.977
GLAD TO HEAR IT.

20:49.749 --> 20:51.721
( chuckles )

20:51.721 --> 20:52.952
( chattering )

20:55.785 --> 20:57.657
( bell jingles )

21:00.360 --> 21:02.962
OH, HEY, ARCHIE, GUYS.

21:02.962 --> 21:04.694
I JUST WANTED TO SAY

21:04.694 --> 21:07.437
CONGRATULATIONS
ON REGIONALS.

21:07.437 --> 21:10.440
DANNY, MAN, COME ON.
PLEASE DON'T MAKE A SCENE.

21:10.440 --> 21:12.772
- OKAY?
- I DON'T WANT
TO MAKE A SCENE, COLE.

21:12.772 --> 21:14.744
I HELPED THE TEAM
WIN A FEW GAMES.

21:14.744 --> 21:17.447
I THINK THAT
I'M PARTLY RESPONSIBLE
FOR THAT...

21:17.447 --> 21:19.779
BANNER UP THERE, RIGHT?

21:19.779 --> 21:21.711
YOU NEED
TO LEAVE, NOW.

21:21.711 --> 21:24.053
Danny:
THAT'S A LOT
OF ATTITUDE, ARCHIE.

21:24.053 --> 21:26.716
IS THIS ABOUT THAT VIDEO?
I'M SORRY.

21:26.716 --> 21:30.460
I GUESS BEEFY MEATHEAD
ISN'T LACEY'S TYPE.

21:33.693 --> 21:35.665
REALLY THINK IT'S SMART
TO PISS ME OFF AGAIN?

21:36.966 --> 21:39.028
YOU DID THAT BEFORE
AND LOOK WHAT'S HAPPENED.

21:42.772 --> 21:43.903
Danny: YEAH.

21:45.335 --> 21:47.076
- LOOK WHAT HAPPENED.
- ( Archie humphs )

21:47.076 --> 21:49.609
SO YOU CAN LEAVE
ON YOUR OWN...

21:50.780 --> 21:53.413
OR WE COULD
FORCIBLY REMOVE YOU.

21:53.413 --> 21:54.814
THAT WON'T BE NECESSARY.

21:56.446 --> 21:57.847
GET THE HELL
OUT OF HERE, DANNY.

21:57.847 --> 22:01.391
LACEY, ARE--
ARE YOU SERIOUSLY
TAKING HIS SIDE?

22:01.391 --> 22:03.653
AFTER ALL
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH,
WHAT WE HAD?

22:03.653 --> 22:05.054
WHAT WE HAD WAS MEANINGLESS.

22:05.054 --> 22:07.397
HOOKING UP WITH YOU
WAS THE DUMBEST THING
I'VE EVER DONE.

22:08.528 --> 22:10.660
IT WAS HURTFUL
TO PEOPLE I CARE ABOUT.

22:10.660 --> 22:13.533
I WISH I COULD
TAKE IT BACK, BUT I CAN'T.

22:13.533 --> 22:16.836
BUT I DON'T HAVE
TO LOOK AT YOU OR BE
NEAR YOU EVER AGAIN.

22:16.836 --> 22:18.037
GET OUT.

22:19.869 --> 22:21.711
( softly ) OKAY.

22:26.776 --> 22:28.347
I WISH YOU'D
NEVER COME BACK HERE!

22:28.347 --> 22:30.780
- ( crowd murmurs )
- Girl: OUCH.

22:30.780 --> 22:32.522
I WISH
I'D NEVER KNOWN YOU.

22:39.729 --> 22:40.890
( bell jingles )

22:57.076 --> 22:59.479
( rock music playing )

23:01.951 --> 23:04.684
- HEY.
- HEY.

23:04.684 --> 23:06.656
DID YOU REALLY MEAN
ALL THAT?

23:06.656 --> 23:09.158
- WHAT YOU SAID TO HIM?
- OF COURSE.

23:10.590 --> 23:13.663
ARCH, LOOK, I GET IT
IF YOU CAN'T FORGIVE ME YET.

23:13.663 --> 23:16.526
I'M NOT SURE
SARITA EVER WILL, FULLY.

23:18.428 --> 23:20.129
BUT I AM TRULY SORRY.

23:22.432 --> 23:23.503
I KNOW.

23:26.476 --> 23:27.577
SARITA WILL COME AROUND.

23:29.539 --> 23:31.541
WE ALL DO...
( clears throat )

23:31.541 --> 23:32.682
BAD THINGS SOMETIMES.

23:33.913 --> 23:37.086
- YEAH.
- I MEAN, I'M GLAD
YOU WERE THERE.

23:37.086 --> 23:40.049
I WOULD'VE THROTTLED THAT FREAK
IF YOU HADN'T JUMPED IN.

23:41.721 --> 23:44.423
WHAT DID YOU MEAN
WHEN YOU SAID THAT TO DANNY?

23:44.423 --> 23:46.856
ABOUT HIM PISSING YOU OFF
AND LOOK WHAT HAPPENED?

23:46.856 --> 23:49.198
NOTHING.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

23:49.198 --> 23:51.661
ARCH, COME ON.
YOU CAN TRUST ME.

23:55.505 --> 23:57.607
OKAY, LOOK...

23:57.607 --> 24:00.069
SCOTT AND I KIND OF...

24:00.069 --> 24:02.542
TOOK MATTERS
INTO OUR OWN HANDS

24:02.542 --> 24:03.843
TO GET DANNY OFF THE TEAM.

24:04.914 --> 24:06.516
YOU MEAN WITH COLE.

24:06.516 --> 24:09.679
WE DIDN'T MEAN TO SEND HIM
TO THE HOSPITAL.

24:09.679 --> 24:11.150
THE PSYCHO WAS
HURTING THE TEAM

24:11.150 --> 24:12.652
AND CAUSING TENSIONS,

24:12.652 --> 24:14.584
BUT NOW HE'S GONE

24:14.584 --> 24:16.726
AND NONE OF US HAVE TO SEE
THAT MURDERER EVER AGAIN.

24:16.726 --> 24:19.028
YEAH, THANK GOD.

24:20.129 --> 24:21.961
SO, DO YOU WANNA SHARE

24:21.961 --> 24:24.934
A BASKET
OF ONION RINGS? ON ME.

24:26.866 --> 24:28.097
YEAH.

24:32.802 --> 24:34.544
( cellphone buzzes )

24:41.611 --> 24:43.613
( bell jingles )

24:49.759 --> 24:53.693
- ( dramatic music playing )
- IT LOOKS DELIGHTFUL.

24:53.693 --> 24:56.826
I WONDER
WHAT THAT SYDNEY GIRL
WOULD THINK OF IT.

24:56.826 --> 24:58.528
WHAT'S IT TRYING TO CONVEY?

24:58.528 --> 25:00.169
( chuckles )

25:00.169 --> 25:03.833
SHE THINKS ALL MICHAEL BAY FILMS
ARE A FASCINATING DECONSTRUCTION

25:03.833 --> 25:06.676
OF THE SOCIETAL OBSESSION
WITH TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENT.

25:06.676 --> 25:08.838
SHE USES THE WORD
"DECONSTRUCTION" A LOT, HUH?

25:08.838 --> 25:11.280
YEAH. NOT REALLY SURE
SHE KNOWS WHAT IT MEANS.

25:11.280 --> 25:13.142
( both laugh )

25:13.142 --> 25:15.144
( people scream )

25:18.087 --> 25:21.821
SO... SHOULD WE HEAD
BACK DOWN THERE?

25:21.821 --> 25:23.553
WE COULD.

25:23.553 --> 25:25.595
YOU ARE THE HOST.

25:25.595 --> 25:26.656
THAT'S TRUE.

25:51.881 --> 25:53.322
WAIT. STOP.

25:54.323 --> 25:55.855
ARE YOU OKAY?

25:58.187 --> 26:01.060
NO. I-- I CAN'T DO THIS.

26:01.060 --> 26:02.732
'CAUSE OF DANNY.

26:02.732 --> 26:05.865
JO, TRUST ME--
THE ONLY WAY TO GET OVER SOMEONE

26:05.865 --> 26:08.167
IS TO THROW YOURSELF
INTO SOMETHING NEW.

26:08.167 --> 26:10.299
OTHERWISE,
YOU'LL NEVER MOVE ON.

26:12.241 --> 26:13.743
I'M SORRY.
I HAVE TO GO.

26:13.743 --> 26:16.145
HEY, JUST REMEMBER

26:16.145 --> 26:19.348
I'M CRAZY ABOUT YOU, OKAY?

26:25.815 --> 26:28.658
I'M ON MY WAY.
DON'T DO ANYTHING ELSE
UNTIL I GET THERE.

26:28.658 --> 26:30.760
- EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?
- YEAH, THAT WAS EDDIE.

26:30.760 --> 26:31.961
I HAVE TO RUN
BACK TO THE STATION.

26:33.192 --> 26:35.364
DON'T WORRY.
IT'S FINE.

26:35.364 --> 26:36.826
ENJOY THAT PASTA, RICO.

26:36.826 --> 26:38.898
( mumbles ) I WILL.
THANKS, CHIEF MASTERSON

26:38.898 --> 26:41.370
( door opens, closes )

26:42.972 --> 26:45.174
MUST BE SUPER STRESSFUL,
BEING MARRIED TO A COP.

26:46.335 --> 26:49.108
I GUESS.
YOU WANT SECONDS?

26:49.108 --> 26:50.940
UM, NO, I'M GOOD.

26:50.940 --> 26:54.343
I'M SURE JO HASN'T EATEN YET,
SO SHE'LL PROBABLY WANT SOME...

26:54.343 --> 26:59.088
- WHEN SHE GETS HOME.
- YOU'RE A REALLY IMPORTANT
PERSON TO JO, RICO.

26:59.088 --> 27:00.690
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

27:02.151 --> 27:03.292
SHE KNOWS IT, TOO.

27:04.654 --> 27:05.725
I PROMISE.

27:08.998 --> 27:11.060
( silverware,
dishes clatter )

27:19.638 --> 27:21.110
THANKS FOR COMING.

27:22.211 --> 27:24.744
SO? WHAT'S THIS ABOUT, DESAI?

27:24.744 --> 27:26.645
YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

27:26.645 --> 27:28.077
YOU HEARD WHAT
ARCHIE SAID BACK THERE.

27:28.077 --> 27:30.049
HE WAS JUST
A LITTLE STEAMED, OKAY?

27:30.049 --> 27:32.982
NO, HE WASN'T.
HE POISONED YOU
TO GET ME OFF OF THE TEAM.

27:32.982 --> 27:34.123
YOU KNOW I'M RIGHT.

27:37.656 --> 27:39.358
SO WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO ABOUT IT?

27:39.358 --> 27:40.359
THAT'S UP TO YOU.

27:41.991 --> 27:45.064
PERSONALLY, I COULD
NEVER TRUST SOMEONE

27:45.064 --> 27:46.696
WHO DID SOMETHING
LIKE THAT TO ME.

27:48.137 --> 27:49.398
THAT'S JUST ME.

27:55.444 --> 27:57.707
( cellphone buzzes )

28:09.719 --> 28:12.421
- ( chattering )
- ( rock music playing )

28:12.421 --> 28:17.096
JANA, TELL LACEY ABOUT
WHAT MR. STEVENS SAID TO YOU
IN EUROPEAN HISTORY.

28:17.096 --> 28:18.728
HE SAID THE SOUND
OF MY VOICE

28:18.728 --> 28:21.130
WAS MAKING IT HARD FOR HIM
TO FOCUS ON TEACHING.

28:21.130 --> 28:22.972
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

28:22.972 --> 28:25.104
WANNA SHARE
ANOTHER BASKET?

28:25.104 --> 28:27.176
- ( door opens, closes )
- UH, NO, I'M GOOD, THANKS.

28:27.176 --> 28:29.478
FARRELL,
WE THOUGHT YOU--

28:29.478 --> 28:32.812
YOU POISONED ME, DIDN'T YOU?
TO GET DANNY OFF THE TEAM.

28:32.812 --> 28:35.084
Archie:
ARE YOU SERIOUS?
WOW. FARRELL, I--

28:35.084 --> 28:37.316
I KNEW YOU HAD A SOFT SPOT
FOR PSYCHO BOY--

28:37.316 --> 28:38.818
OKAY, DON'T FREAKING
LIE TO ME.

28:38.818 --> 28:40.449
HEY, THAT'S YOUR CAPTAIN.

28:42.792 --> 28:44.253
I'M NOT LYING TO YOU.

28:44.253 --> 28:46.225
YES, HE IS.

28:47.326 --> 28:49.298
HE JUST ADMITTED IT TO ME.

28:49.298 --> 28:51.300
HE SAID
IT WAS HIM AND SCOTT.

28:51.300 --> 28:53.102
( people murmuring )

28:53.102 --> 28:56.135
( Archie scoffs )
COME ON, COLE, ARE YOU
GONNA BELIEVE HER?

28:56.135 --> 28:58.107
THE BITCH WAS SCREWING
THE FREAK FIVE MINUTES AGO.

28:58.107 --> 28:59.368
( humphs )

29:02.171 --> 29:03.472
GOOD LUCK AT REGIONALS.

29:09.218 --> 29:11.150
THESE PEOPLE
MAY ALL BELIEVE YOU,

29:11.150 --> 29:13.282
BUT IF YOU HAVE
ANY SELF-RESPECT LEFT,

29:13.282 --> 29:16.225
- YOU'LL ADMIT IT WAS YOU.
- GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE.

29:16.225 --> 29:17.827
NO, DON'T WORRY.
I'M GONE.

29:19.428 --> 29:23.162
AND USING
REGINA TO SHAME ME?
LOW BLOW, SARITA.

29:33.903 --> 29:36.075
- ( keyboard clicking )
- ( crickets chirping )

29:37.376 --> 29:39.108
KAREN, HOW'S IT COMING?

29:39.108 --> 29:41.180
- ALMOST FINISHED.
- MMM.

29:41.180 --> 29:43.983
OOH, CAN I ASK YOU
ONE QUICK QUESTION
BEFORE YOU GO?

29:43.983 --> 29:46.956
- SURE.
- I PULLED THE FILES
ON SOME PAST SALES

29:46.956 --> 29:48.517
TO SEE WHAT I SHOULD INCLUDE
IN THE VIRTUAL TOUR,

29:48.517 --> 29:52.021
AND I STUMBLED
UPON SOMETHING ODD
IN THESE FINANCIAL RECORDS.

29:54.363 --> 29:56.295
MMM. IT SEEMS NORMAL TO ME.

29:57.796 --> 29:59.969
YOU REPRESENTED THE BUYER
AND THE SELLER HERE,

29:59.969 --> 30:02.531
BUT YOU ONLY DECLARED
COMMISSION FOR ONE OF 'EM.

30:04.233 --> 30:07.106
NO KIDDING.
MUST BE A CLERICAL ERROR.

30:07.106 --> 30:09.378
( laughs )
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT, TOO.

30:09.378 --> 30:11.140
BUT IT TURNS OUT
THE SAME ERROR WAS MADE

30:11.140 --> 30:13.442
ON PROPERTIES
GOING BACK SEVEN YEARS.

30:15.114 --> 30:16.385
SOMEONE'S BEEN
A BUSY GIRL.

30:18.547 --> 30:22.091
SO I GET A LITTLE CREATIVE
WITH MY TAXES.

30:22.091 --> 30:23.923
IT'S COMMON
IN THE REAL ESTATE BUSINESS.

30:23.923 --> 30:27.826
I'M NOT SURE
THE I.R.S. WOULD AGREE.

30:27.826 --> 30:31.130
WELL, THE I.R.S.
DOES NOT KNOW.

30:31.130 --> 30:32.561
FOR NOW.

30:34.864 --> 30:36.866
ARE YOU
BLACKMAILING ME, KAREN?

30:40.569 --> 30:42.571
( crickets chirping )

30:49.378 --> 30:52.121
I GOTTA SAY, OF ALL THE PEOPLE
I THOUGHT WOULD TEXT ME--

30:52.121 --> 30:53.522
I HAVE TO
TELL YOU SOMETHING.

30:53.522 --> 30:55.184
OKAY.

30:55.184 --> 30:57.126
WHAT IS IT?

30:58.857 --> 30:59.989
WHEN I SAW THAT VIDEO...

31:01.260 --> 31:02.461
IT HURT.

31:04.033 --> 31:07.266
AND NOT JUST BECAUSE
YOU LIED, AGAIN.

31:10.039 --> 31:12.071
BUT BECAUSE...

31:13.542 --> 31:16.105
I HAVE
THESE FEELINGS FOR YOU.

31:16.105 --> 31:18.647
- JO, LOOK,
WE DON'T HAVE TO--
- I HAVE TO.

31:19.949 --> 31:21.280
I HAVE TO SAY IT
TO YOU, DANNY,

31:21.280 --> 31:22.111
TO YOUR FACE.

31:24.553 --> 31:28.357
I CAN'T MOVE ON
UNLESS I KNOW,

31:28.357 --> 31:31.660
UNLESS I'M SURE
THAT YOU COULD NEVER
FEEL THE SAME WAY.

31:36.125 --> 31:39.028
JO, YOU ARE
THE MOST INCREDIBLE PERSON
THAT I HAVE EVER MET.

31:39.028 --> 31:41.100
- PLEASE DON'T PATRONIZE ME.
- I'M NOT.

31:44.173 --> 31:46.435
OUR FRIENDSHIP
MEANS SO MUCH TO ME

31:46.435 --> 31:50.239
AND I DON'T WANNA RISK THAT,
TURNING IT INTO SOMETHING ELSE.

31:50.239 --> 31:51.580
BUT YOU CAN RISK IT
FOR LACEY.

31:53.182 --> 31:55.284
THAT'S DIFFERENT.

31:57.586 --> 31:59.418
DO YOU STILL HAVE
FEELINGS FOR HER?

32:01.920 --> 32:04.293
LA-- LACEY AND I--
LOOK, WE'RE OVER.

32:04.293 --> 32:06.125
THAT'S NOT WHAT I ASKED.
YOU STILL HAVE FEELINGS FOR HER.

32:09.658 --> 32:12.361
DON'T LIE TO ME.

32:12.361 --> 32:14.303
FOR ONCE, JUST...

32:15.464 --> 32:17.236
THE TRUTH.

32:25.074 --> 32:26.615
I'M SO SORRY, JO.

32:30.249 --> 32:32.451
WE'RE GONNA
GET THROUGH THIS,

32:32.451 --> 32:34.023
THE THREE OF US, OKAY?

32:34.023 --> 32:36.085
THAT'S WHAT'S
MOST IMPORTANT, RIGHT?

32:36.085 --> 32:38.087
RIGHT?

32:44.633 --> 32:46.135
GOODBYE, DANNY.

32:58.407 --> 33:00.149
- ( police radio chatter )
- Eddie: IT'S CONFIRMED.

33:00.149 --> 33:02.011
TRACES OF BLOOD
AND HAIR ON THE PIPE

33:02.011 --> 33:03.182
MATCH THE VICTIM.

33:03.182 --> 33:06.085
AND DANNY DESAI'S FINGERPRINTS
ARE ALL OVER IT.

33:06.085 --> 33:08.617
- WHAT ABOUT THAT PAINT?
- IT MATCHES WHAT WAS FOUND

33:08.617 --> 33:09.718
AT THE VICTIM'S
POINT OF IMPACT.

33:09.718 --> 33:11.760
IT'S SOLID, BOSS.

33:11.760 --> 33:14.693
IT'S GOOD THING WE SEARCHED
THAT POND AGAIN, HUH, CHIEF?

33:14.693 --> 33:16.095
GOOD THING.

33:16.095 --> 33:18.427
I'M GONNA TAKE SOME TIME
WITH THIS NEW EVIDENCE,

33:18.427 --> 33:20.299
LOOK INTO IT
BEFORE WE MAKE
ANY RASH DECISIONS.

33:20.299 --> 33:23.032
THE TOWN'S BEEN WAITING WEEKS
FOR THIS TO BE SOLVED,

33:23.032 --> 33:24.433
NOT TO MENTION THE MAYOR.

33:24.433 --> 33:27.536
I HAVE A PATROL CAR STATIONED
OUTSIDE THE DESAIS' RESIDENCE

33:27.536 --> 33:29.208
THE MINUTE
THE BOY ARRIVES HOME,

33:29.208 --> 33:31.009
I STRONGLY SUGGEST
WE GO ARREST HIM.

33:31.009 --> 33:34.083
IF THAT'S ALL RIGHT
WITH YOU, CHIEF.

33:34.083 --> 33:36.145
IT IS YOUR CASE.

33:42.621 --> 33:44.293
Tess:
A MURDER WEAPON?

33:46.225 --> 33:48.697
KYLE, IT CAN'T BE.

33:48.697 --> 33:51.160
Are you sure it had
Danny's fingerprints on it?

33:51.160 --> 33:53.332
I CAN'T GET
INTO THE DETAILS RIGHT NOW.

33:53.332 --> 33:55.504
- WHEN JO GETS HOME, JUST--
- I'll deal with Jo.

33:57.306 --> 33:59.468
- WHAT DID YOU FIND?
- HONEY, I'M SORRY.

33:59.468 --> 34:01.410
I HAVE TO GO.
I'LL KEEP YOU UPDATED, OKAY?

34:01.410 --> 34:03.672
- Okay.
- ( beeps )

34:13.752 --> 34:15.754
( distant barking )

34:17.656 --> 34:19.388
( lock clicks )

34:21.290 --> 34:23.832
HEY, JO,
I DIDN'T THINK YOU...

34:34.543 --> 34:36.505
WOW. UMM...

34:36.505 --> 34:38.577
YOU'RE GOOD AT THAT.

34:38.577 --> 34:41.310
- ( both laugh )
- WHY IS THAT FUNNY?

34:43.612 --> 34:44.713
NO NO, IT'S JUST...

34:48.587 --> 34:51.460
THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME
THAT I DID THAT.

34:53.162 --> 34:54.593
WHAT WE JUST DID.

34:54.593 --> 34:57.566
IT'S THE FIRST TIME
THAT I'VE DONE ANYTHING.

34:59.097 --> 35:02.601
WHAT?
YOUR-- YOUR FIRST KISS?.

35:03.672 --> 35:05.804
WOW. LOOK AT YOU.
( laughs )

35:05.804 --> 35:07.276
( laughs )

35:07.276 --> 35:09.638
OH, SORRY, SORRY.
I DIDN'T-- I DIDN'T MEAN...

35:11.109 --> 35:14.112
I'M HONORED
TO BE YOUR FIRST...

35:14.112 --> 35:15.714
OF EVERYTHING.

35:17.186 --> 35:18.547
( chuckles )

35:23.892 --> 35:26.595
I SHOULD GO.
MY PARENTS TEND TO WORRY.

35:26.595 --> 35:28.427
CAN'T WORRY THE PARENTS.

35:35.204 --> 35:37.166
DO YOU MIND
SHUTTING YOUR EYES?

36:07.736 --> 36:10.669
- THERE YOU ARE.
- WHAT ARE YOU--
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

36:10.669 --> 36:13.202
GO UPSTAIRS.
PACK A BAG.
WE'RE LEAVING.

36:13.202 --> 36:15.374
LEAVING? WHY?

36:16.645 --> 36:19.608
THEY FOUND THE MURDER WEAPON--
WITH YOUR FINGERPRINTS ON IT.

36:19.608 --> 36:21.650
THEY'RE COMING
TO ARREST YOU.

36:23.582 --> 36:25.584
DANNY, GO.
WE HAVE TO LEAVE NOW.

36:25.584 --> 36:29.318
WAIT, THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
I-- I DIDN'T--

36:29.318 --> 36:30.589
DANNY, PLEASE,
YOU HAVE TO TRUST ME.

36:30.589 --> 36:32.491
I HAVE
RESOURCES NOW, MONEY.

36:32.491 --> 36:33.592
I HAVE ACCESS
TO A LOT OF MONEY.

36:33.592 --> 36:35.724
WE'RE GONNA BE OKAY
FOR A WHILE, OKAY?

36:35.724 --> 36:36.965
- PLEASE.
- MOTHER, WE CAN'T JUST--

36:36.965 --> 36:39.928
THERE IS NOTHING
KEEPING US HERE ANYMORE.

36:39.928 --> 36:41.530
NOTHING.

36:46.635 --> 36:48.637
OKAY.

36:56.285 --> 36:57.686
( sighs )

36:58.987 --> 37:01.920
HEY. HOW'D YOU...?

37:01.920 --> 37:04.323
I JUST CAME
TO GET MY BACKPACK

37:04.323 --> 37:05.754
AND THEN YOUR MOM
MADE ME SPAGHETTI.

37:05.754 --> 37:06.895
IT WAS REALLY YUMMY.

37:06.895 --> 37:09.728
UM, SHE'S JUST
IN HER ART STUDIO DOING ART,

37:09.728 --> 37:12.601
AND SHE SAID I COULD
HANG OUT TILL YOU GOT BACK.

37:15.964 --> 37:18.567
I'M SO SORRY
THAT I LIED TO YOU.

37:19.638 --> 37:21.570
I KNOW YOU ARE.

37:23.241 --> 37:25.944
- OKAY.
- RICO, YOU'RE MY...

37:28.717 --> 37:32.521
YOU'RE LIKE THIS
AMAZING CONSTANT
IN MY LIFE,

37:32.521 --> 37:35.424
WHICH IS REALLY COMPLICATED
RIGHT NOW.

37:37.386 --> 37:40.489
AND I JUST NEED TO KNOW
THAT YOU'RE ALWAYS GONNA BE

37:40.489 --> 37:42.691
UP FRONT WITH ME, OKAY?

37:43.692 --> 37:45.263
SO YOU--
YOU DON'T HATE ME?

37:46.635 --> 37:48.337
I COULD NEVER HATE YOU.

37:54.973 --> 37:56.575
I LOVE YOU.

37:56.575 --> 37:58.307
( chuckles )

38:03.712 --> 38:05.754
- RICO.
- I-- I LOVE YOU.

38:05.754 --> 38:07.986
I'M TOTALLY IN LOVE WITH YOU.
YOU'RE LIKE MY DREAM GIRL.

38:09.488 --> 38:10.959
RICO, PLEASE.

38:17.696 --> 38:20.329
I'M SORRY. THAT--
THAT WAS INAPPROPRIATE.

38:25.774 --> 38:27.476
AREN'T YOU GONNA
SAY ANYTHING?

38:29.638 --> 38:31.410
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

38:35.744 --> 38:36.985
( mutters )
RIGHT. OKAY.

38:36.985 --> 38:38.747
UMM, OKAY.

38:42.551 --> 38:45.694
( door opens, closes )

39:12.621 --> 39:14.453
( clicks )

39:19.628 --> 39:21.059
- ( knocks )
- Phoebe: LACE?

39:21.059 --> 39:24.362
HEY. SORRY, YOUR MOM SAID
I COULD JUST COME RIGHT UP.

39:24.362 --> 39:25.594
PHOEBE,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

39:25.594 --> 39:27.996
WELL, ACCUSING THE HOST
OF POISONING SOMEONE

39:27.996 --> 39:30.499
TENDS TO KILL
A PARTY PRETTY FAST.

39:30.499 --> 39:32.771
- I SWEAR,
ARCHIE TOLD ME THAT--
- I BELIEVE YOU.

39:40.108 --> 39:41.810
YOU LOOK GORGEOUS IN THIS.

39:41.810 --> 39:44.112
( scoffs ) THANKS.

39:44.112 --> 39:46.785
HEY, WHAT HAPPENED
TO REGINA'S ARM?

39:49.618 --> 39:52.521
- WHAT?
- ( laughs ) YOU.

39:52.521 --> 39:54.523
YOU HAPPENED, REMEMBER?

39:54.523 --> 39:56.625
WHEN YOU GUYS GOT
IN THAT BIG FIGHT OVER CRAIG.

39:56.625 --> 40:00.128
- YOU SCRATCHED HER.
- NO, I DIDN'T.

40:00.128 --> 40:02.731
- PHOEBE,
IT'S OKAY NOW. I DON'T--
- NO, I SWEAR I DIDN'T.

40:02.731 --> 40:07.676
I MIGHT HAVE PULLED
OUT SOME OF HER HAIR,
BUT I DON'T SCRATCH.

40:07.676 --> 40:10.979
OKAY, WELL, THEN WHO DID?
AND WHY DID REGINA TELL
EVERYONE IT WAS YOU?

40:12.010 --> 40:13.782
WAIT. THAT CAR.

40:13.782 --> 40:15.684
I TOTALLY FORGOT
ABOUT THAT.

40:15.684 --> 40:17.546
IT WAS THE PERSON
IN THAT CAR.

40:17.546 --> 40:19.588
Girl:
LET'S JUST DO IT LATER.

40:21.149 --> 40:23.452
HEY. REGINA.

40:23.452 --> 40:25.694
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.
DID YOU ACTUALLY TELL--

40:25.694 --> 40:28.156
SERIOUSLY, PHOEBE,
NOT NOW.

40:29.758 --> 40:32.801
OH MY GOD.
THAT BITCH.

40:33.962 --> 40:36.635
SHE IS SO GONNA PAY
FOR THIS.

40:38.066 --> 40:41.570
WHO WAS THAT?
REGINA, WHO DID THAT TO YOU?

40:41.570 --> 40:42.841
IT'S NOT IMPORTANT.

40:43.912 --> 40:46.014
HELLO? HI.

40:46.014 --> 40:48.877
LOOK, I'M VERY SORRY
THAT YOU'RE BLEEDING
ALL OVER YOURSELF

40:48.877 --> 40:50.719
OR WHATEVER,
BUT WE NEED TO TALK.

40:50.719 --> 40:52.781
I DON'T THINK WE DO.

40:54.653 --> 40:55.654
Phoebe's voice: REGINA!

40:55.654 --> 40:57.125
I CHASED REGINA INSIDE

40:57.125 --> 40:59.858
AND THINGS JUST KINDA
WENT FROM THERE.

40:59.858 --> 41:01.760
I CAN'T BELIEVE REGINA
NEVER TOLD ME ABOUT THAT.

41:01.760 --> 41:04.693
- DID YOU SEE
THE PERSON IN THAT CAR?
- NO, THE WINDOWS WERE TINTED.

41:06.064 --> 41:08.667
BUT I REMEMBER
THAT THE CAR HAD
A CONNECTICUT LICENSE PLATE.

41:08.667 --> 41:10.499
- CONNECTICUT?
- YEAH.

41:10.499 --> 41:12.541
I THOUGHT IT WAS
SO WEIRD AND RANDOM.

41:13.942 --> 41:15.944
( engine idling )

41:20.478 --> 41:21.610
( engine stops )

41:34.563 --> 41:37.165
DANNY, COME ON!
HURRY UP!

41:37.165 --> 41:39.227
( Marilyn pounds )
POLICE! OPEN UP!

41:39.227 --> 41:41.630
KAREN, OPEN THE DOOR.
IT'S ME, KYLE.

41:41.630 --> 41:44.502
- ( pounds ) KAREN.
- Marilyn: OPEN UP!

41:46.705 --> 41:48.276
WE HAVE A WARRANT
TO ARREST YOUR SON

41:48.276 --> 41:49.838
FOR THE MURDER
OF REGINA CRANE.

41:49.838 --> 41:51.880
( door closes )

41:51.880 --> 41:54.543
PLANNING A TRIP,
MRS. DESAI?

41:57.686 --> 42:00.248
- NO, I WAS JUST--
- WHERE'S DANNY?

42:02.651 --> 42:03.792
WHERE IS HE?

42:06.795 --> 42:07.856
UPSTAIRS.

42:11.630 --> 42:12.801
YOU WERE GONNA
LEAVE TOWN.

42:14.633 --> 42:16.835
HOW DID YOU KNOW
WE WERE COMING?

42:16.835 --> 42:18.807
Marilyn:
CHIEF MASTERSON!

42:25.814 --> 42:28.146
DANNY DESAI HAS FLED.
HAVE ALL AVAILABLE UNITS

42:28.146 --> 42:30.248
REPORT TO THE DESAI
RESIDENCE, NOW.

42:30.248 --> 42:31.319
( phone beeps )

43:25.804 --> 43:27.936
( rings )

43:27.936 --> 43:29.878
Man:
Who is this?

43:32.711 --> 43:34.082
( whispers )
IT'S ME.

43:34.082 --> 43:36.845
Tess, what's wrong?
What happened?

43:36.845 --> 43:39.017
IT'S BAD.

43:39.017 --> 43:40.649
REALLY BAD.

43:40.649 --> 43:42.891
I THINK IT'S TIME.

43:45.894 --> 43:47.896
IT'S TIME FOR YOU
TO COME BACK, VIKRAM.
