00:18.912 --> 00:20.903
It's alive!

00:39.132 --> 00:41.534
Can you show us the area
where the man touched you?

00:41.569 --> 00:44.025
Right here...

00:44.104 --> 00:45.594
on my penis!

00:57.917 --> 01:00.886
I got to stop eating macaroni
and cheese with every meal.

01:00.954 --> 01:02.114
It's nature's ass cork.

01:02.188 --> 01:03.553
Tiny, you're late.

01:03.623 --> 01:05.488
Your team needs you in battle.

01:05.558 --> 01:07.651
Okay, here we go!

01:07.727 --> 01:10.491
Ho ho ho ho ho ho!

01:11.498 --> 01:13.090
All:
Oh!

01:13.166 --> 01:13.996
Tiny!

01:14.067 --> 01:15.967
That is terribly gross.

01:16.035 --> 01:17.093
How embarrassing.

01:17.170 --> 01:18.762
We're just concerned,
Tiny.

01:18.838 --> 01:20.533
Yeah,
the problem's getting bigger.

01:20.607 --> 01:21.505
Like your stomach.

01:21.574 --> 01:23.041
Just let me eat
my pizza in peace.

01:23.109 --> 01:24.440
That's not pizza.

01:24.511 --> 01:27.446
That's the cardboard circle you
microwave the pizza on!

01:27.514 --> 01:29.141
Oh.

01:38.424 --> 01:39.254
It's Zoltar!

01:39.325 --> 01:40.155
Okay, team...

01:40.226 --> 01:41.591
G- force!

01:45.732 --> 01:48.724
Wow, Tiny,
that was impressive.

01:50.036 --> 01:52.061
You're my he-hero!

01:52.138 --> 01:54.072
Looks like fatty's stealing
all our thunder.

01:54.140 --> 01:55.072
You thinking
what I'm thinking?

01:55.141 --> 01:56.574
Uh-huh.

01:56.643 --> 02:00.044
Hey, Tiny, I thought we could
celebrate today's vic... wow.

02:00.113 --> 02:03.173
Okay, we were not thinking the
same thing at all here.

02:03.249 --> 02:04.734
Hello, and welcome to
"Mythbusters. "

02:04.769 --> 02:06.219
On today's episode,
the holocaust.

02:06.254 --> 02:07.387
Hold that thought, Adam.

02:07.422 --> 02:08.572
Mythbusters.

02:08.607 --> 02:09.687
Please help!

02:09.722 --> 02:11.019
My son won't stop masturbating.

02:11.224 --> 02:14.421
I told him he'll go blind, but
he says that's just a myth.

02:14.494 --> 02:15.791
Is that true?

02:15.862 --> 02:16.692
We got one!

02:22.168 --> 02:24.295
Masturbation does not
cause blindness.

02:24.370 --> 02:26.133
The only correlation
between the two

02:26.206 --> 02:28.231
is that semen contains a
large amount of zinc.

02:29.309 --> 02:30.867
As much as. 25
milligrams of zinc

02:30.944 --> 02:32.434
to one milliliter of
seminal fluid.

02:32.512 --> 02:35.538
<i>A deficiency of zinc can
cause blindness.</i>

02:35.615 --> 02:37.014
But the loss of zinc through
masturbation

02:37.083 --> 02:38.914
isn't nearly enough
to cause a deficiency.

02:40.820 --> 02:42.447
You called about a myth?

02:42.522 --> 02:43.750
Yeah, I thought we just...

02:43.823 --> 02:45.484
There's no time!

02:45.558 --> 02:46.752
Oh, my God!

02:46.826 --> 02:48.760
Both:
Mythbusters, go!

02:48.828 --> 02:50.853
Aah!

02:50.930 --> 02:51.988
I'm sorry!

02:52.065 --> 02:55.091
I swear I'll never
masturbate again!

02:55.168 --> 02:56.533
Another myth busted.

02:56.603 --> 02:58.594
Both:
Here on "Mythbusters"!

03:00.273 --> 03:01.406
Ow!

03:01.441 --> 03:03.076
Mother... fucking
piece of shit!

03:09.782 --> 03:13.152
Are you Timmy?

03:13.187 --> 03:14.452
Damn it!

03:14.487 --> 03:16.011
I'll find him.

03:17.924 --> 03:19.721
Run, Forrest! Run!

03:20.827 --> 03:22.760
Well, blow me down!

03:22.795 --> 03:24.764
What's everybody doing in me
living room?

03:24.799 --> 03:25.930
Oh, Popeye!

03:25.965 --> 03:27.232
It's the spinach.

03:27.267 --> 03:28.859
We think you're addicted.

03:29.035 --> 03:31.469
Those forearms are grotesque,
son.

03:31.537 --> 03:32.834
It ain't natural.

03:32.905 --> 03:34.270
Me spinach?

03:34.340 --> 03:35.466
Ha-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga!

03:35.541 --> 03:37.406
It's spinach.

03:37.477 --> 03:39.274
Then hand it over.

03:39.345 --> 03:40.277
What?

03:41.547 --> 03:43.845
You're out of your
cotton-picking minds!

03:43.916 --> 03:47.113
You can't take me spinach.

03:49.756 --> 03:51.314
Aah!

03:51.391 --> 03:53.154
Popeye, me boy,
fight it!

03:53.226 --> 03:54.215
Fight it, son!

03:54.294 --> 03:57.055
I can't!

03:59.799 --> 04:01.432
So why are you here?

04:01.467 --> 04:04.704
I want to destroy cities and
rid the streets of weaponry.

04:04.739 --> 04:08.538
<i>Yeah, but why
are you really here?</i>

04:08.608 --> 04:11.304
I want to be king of the
monsters.

04:11.377 --> 04:12.503
There you go.

04:12.578 --> 04:14.808
Now if you stick with me,
you'll make it.

04:14.881 --> 04:17.247
But you got to unlearn that
bullshit that they teach you

04:17.317 --> 04:19.113
on monster island now,
'cause that shit

04:19.185 --> 04:20.743
will get you killed
out here.

04:20.820 --> 04:22.287
I'll do anything you
want me to do.

04:23.489 --> 04:25.320
My lizard.
Now, how's your Japanese?

04:25.391 --> 04:26.415
Not that good.

04:26.492 --> 04:27.686
Well, you learn that shit then,
brother,

04:27.760 --> 04:29.318
'cause that
shit will get you killed.

04:29.395 --> 04:30.623
These mother fuckers out there

04:30.697 --> 04:34.064
be planning all types
of shit on you.

04:34.133 --> 04:36.101
Hey, yo, Mazinger,
you got my stuff?

04:36.169 --> 04:37.261
Yo, what you need, 'Zilla?

04:37.337 --> 04:38.167
Check it out.

04:38.237 --> 04:39.226
I got rocket-firing hands.

04:39.305 --> 04:40.738
I got rockets for
your shoulders and legs.

04:40.807 --> 04:41.933
My shit is tight!

04:42.008 --> 04:43.373
Yeah, that's what
I'm talking about.

04:43.443 --> 04:45.343
Well, anyway...

04:45.411 --> 04:46.503
what did you do?!

04:46.579 --> 04:48.604
Justifiable homicide in the
line of duty.

04:48.681 --> 04:49.909
No, that was murder.

04:49.982 --> 04:51.347
Open your eyes, son.

04:51.417 --> 04:54.045
That man was your friend, and
you killed him like a fly.

04:54.120 --> 04:56.020
Why is he my friend, huh?

04:56.089 --> 04:57.113
Because he knows my name?

04:57.190 --> 04:58.919
Mazinger sold guns and rockets.

04:58.991 --> 05:00.856
The world is a better place
without him, anyway.

05:00.927 --> 05:01.951
Now get your ass in the car.

05:02.028 --> 05:02.858
No way, man.

05:02.929 --> 05:04.089
I'm getting reassigned.

05:04.163 --> 05:05.187
Well, you do that.

05:05.264 --> 05:06.595
You tell them what I did.

05:06.666 --> 05:09.134
I don't give a damn,
'cause I got news for you.

05:09.202 --> 05:14.196
King Kong ain't got
shit on me.

05:15.375 --> 05:16.841
# Do do do
going to work,

05:16.876 --> 05:19.208
# Helping the environment,
saving the economy #

05:25.485 --> 05:30.047
Sorry, Council of Evil Tables,
your villainy stops now.

05:30.123 --> 05:33.115
So says the Table Smasher!

05:38.831 --> 05:43.894
So we meet again, South African
oak conference table!

05:45.972 --> 05:46.802
Rats!

05:46.873 --> 05:48.738
Diplomatic immunity!

05:48.808 --> 05:49.672
Oh!

05:49.742 --> 05:50.936
Don't do it,
Table Smasher!

05:51.010 --> 05:54.070
You know what this
table took from me!

05:54.147 --> 05:55.409
It ain't worth it.

05:57.383 --> 05:58.941
Like hell it ain't!

06:04.023 --> 06:05.047
Oh, lord!

06:05.124 --> 06:07.319
That wobble's never
gonna go away.

06:07.393 --> 06:09.554
Go ahead!
Slap the cuffs on me.

06:09.629 --> 06:10.721
I don't care.

06:13.132 --> 06:14.929
I didn't see nothing.

06:15.001 --> 06:17.162
I didn't see nothing at all.

06:17.236 --> 06:20.807
If you give a mouse a cookie,
he'll want a glass of milk.

06:20.842 --> 06:23.309
If you give a mouse some milk,
he'll want some more.

06:23.344 --> 06:25.038
If you give a mouse more milk,

06:25.278 --> 06:27.746
he'll develop a taste
for human blood.

06:27.814 --> 06:30.009
If he develops a taste
for human blood,

06:30.082 --> 06:31.947
he'll become a
vampire.

06:32.018 --> 06:33.781
If he becomes a vampire,

06:33.853 --> 06:36.686
he'll have to make some followers.

06:36.756 --> 06:41.523
Now if he makes some followers,
they will need to feed.

06:41.594 --> 06:43.118
If they feed too much,

06:43.196 --> 06:45.892
the national guard
will be called out.

06:45.965 --> 06:48.763
If the national guard is called
out, they, too,

06:48.835 --> 06:51.633
will become fodder
for the vampires.

06:51.704 --> 06:53.604
If the national guard fails,

06:53.673 --> 06:57.507
the president will call in a
nuclear strike.

06:57.577 --> 06:59.169
If a nuke is dropped,

06:59.245 --> 07:01.907
hundreds of thousands
of people will die.

07:01.981 --> 07:05.576
America will become a nuclear
wasteland and collapse!

07:05.651 --> 07:08.711
With no one to keep the rest of
the world's nukes in check,

07:08.788 --> 07:12.224
every crackpot nation will
launch their own!

07:12.291 --> 07:16.057
Eventually, the entire earth
will be destroyed.

07:16.128 --> 07:19.564
And that's why I had
to kill daddy.

07:19.632 --> 07:21.429
He was giving a mouse a cookie.

07:22.401 --> 07:24.733
Sleep well, sweetie.

07:25.104 --> 07:26.304
I know what you're thinking.

07:26.339 --> 07:28.940
"Did he fire six shots
or only five?"

07:28.975 --> 07:30.743
Well, you got to ask
yourself one question.

07:30.778 --> 07:32.058
"Do I feel lucky?"

07:32.093 --> 07:33.339
Well, do you, punk?

07:33.579 --> 07:34.443
You know what?

07:34.514 --> 07:36.311
I do!

07:36.382 --> 07:37.314
Hot damn!

07:37.383 --> 07:39.544
This must be my lucky day!

07:39.619 --> 07:41.211
Get back here, punk!

07:41.287 --> 07:42.117
I'm gonna... ooh!

07:42.188 --> 07:43.212
Aah!

07:44.290 --> 07:45.587
Stop right there!

07:45.658 --> 07:46.488
Stop that guy!

07:46.559 --> 07:47.719
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

07:47.793 --> 07:49.784
I'm the luckiest bastard on
the planet!

07:49.862 --> 07:50.920
I can't be stopped.

07:50.997 --> 07:52.658
Just call me Lucky McLuckerton.

07:52.732 --> 07:54.563
# Lucky, lucky, doodle-do #

07:54.634 --> 07:56.124
# I have luck instead of you #

07:56.202 --> 07:57.669
There he is.

07:57.737 --> 07:59.500
Don't let him get away!

07:59.572 --> 08:01.005
Get your hands off me!

08:02.008 --> 08:03.908
Really good day,
really good.

08:03.976 --> 08:05.466
Really good being thought of.

08:05.545 --> 08:06.842
What the...?

08:06.913 --> 08:09.177
Aw, man, there's a leprechaun
on my shoe.

08:09.248 --> 08:11.307
Ha!
Gotcha, punk.

08:11.384 --> 08:13.648
I'm completely buggered.

08:13.719 --> 08:15.311
Please help me.

08:17.256 --> 08:18.624
The cow says...

08:18.659 --> 08:19.859
Moo!

08:22.395 --> 08:23.623
Your mom says...

08:24.830 --> 08:26.354
...because my cock is in
her mouth.

08:26.432 --> 08:27.592
Get it, kid?

08:27.667 --> 08:29.100
My cock in her mouth.

08:29.201 --> 08:31.569
This is Bob Barker
ending my last show,

08:31.604 --> 08:34.941
reminding you to help
control the pet population.

08:34.976 --> 08:36.932
Spay or neuter your pets today.

08:37.009 --> 08:38.169
So long, everybody.

08:40.313 --> 08:42.837
Hey, Phil, have you spayed or
neutered your pet today?

08:42.914 --> 08:44.678
Nah, I'll do it tomorrow.

08:44.750 --> 08:46.012
You really should do it
today.

08:46.085 --> 08:46.949
Whatever.

08:47.019 --> 08:48.281
Hmm...

08:48.354 --> 08:49.912
I'd say that's $30 for
the hedge clippers.

08:49.989 --> 08:50.887
Right.

08:50.957 --> 08:52.151
$12.48 for the hair trimmers.

08:52.224 --> 08:53.316
Right.

08:53.392 --> 08:55.360
And $18.29
for the chloroform.

08:55.428 --> 08:57.157
Right again, Bob.

08:58.798 --> 09:00.925
I've never felt so alive!

09:01.000 --> 09:03.628
All those years
of talking about it,

09:03.703 --> 09:07.332
and now i'm actually doing
something about it.

09:16.983 --> 09:19.508
No more hair balls for you.

09:21.454 --> 09:23.046
Come on down!

09:24.190 --> 09:26.090
The horses are at the
starting gate.

09:26.158 --> 09:27.682
And they're off.

09:27.760 --> 09:30.160
With the help of flowers and
some Barry White,

09:30.229 --> 09:32.754
we hope Jengo
will finally impregnate Ming Li

09:32.832 --> 09:35.130
and save the species.

09:35.201 --> 09:36.668
Yo, boss, this is crazy.

09:36.736 --> 09:39.637
We got to watch our backs if
we're gonna save our sacs.

09:39.705 --> 09:40.603
You got a plan?

09:41.674 --> 09:44.575
The mysterious castrating
vigilante has struck again.

09:44.644 --> 09:47.636
In an unrelated story, the
annual dog show starts today.

09:53.352 --> 09:56.515
This dog show's a no-show.

09:56.589 --> 09:59.820
I expect better manners
from my guests, Bob.

09:59.892 --> 10:02.156
You?
I should have known!

10:02.228 --> 10:03.525
That's right.

10:03.596 --> 10:08.533
And there's no way you're gonna
shizzle my nizzle.

10:08.601 --> 10:11.468
It's for the good
of the pet population!

10:29.088 --> 10:30.988
You know, Bob,
I have to hand it to you.

10:31.057 --> 10:32.183
What's that?

10:32.258 --> 10:33.555
Your nuts!

10:33.626 --> 10:36.220
Aaaahhhhh!

10:36.295 --> 10:39.287
Ha ha ha ha ha!

10:39.365 --> 10:42.027
I'm 83 years old, stupid.

10:42.101 --> 10:44.228
I've been shooting
dust for years.
