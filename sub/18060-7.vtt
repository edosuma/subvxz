00:11.553 --> 00:12.596
I'm afraid you're wrong.

00:15.140 --> 00:17.267
I know your daughter,
and I know where she went.

00:17.351 --> 00:19.186
-You've seen Alice?
-I can take you to her.

00:26.985 --> 00:29.029
Please don't leave me, <i>maaman.</i>

00:29.404 --> 00:31.448
Tell me what to do. What herbs should...

00:31.532 --> 00:33.909
There's nothing left to do, Jafar.

00:33.992 --> 00:35.369
Don't say that.

00:36.203 --> 00:39.289
You're a healer. You've cured many others.

00:39.373 --> 00:42.835
I fear I am beyond help. (SWALLOWS)

00:42.918 --> 00:45.879
It's my time. I'm sorry.

Your father.

00:59.351 --> 01:01.520
I... I don't understand.

01:02.813 --> 01:05.440
Father died when I was...

01:05.524 --> 01:10.195
Your father, your real father,
he still lives, Jafar.

01:10.821 --> 01:14.741
Go to him at the palace.

01:14.825 --> 01:16.660
But only the Sultan lives there.

01:16.743 --> 01:19.246
That's right, Jafar.

01:21.331 --> 01:23.000
He's my father?

01:27.462 --> 01:30.382
This belonged to him.

01:32.092 --> 01:33.218
Return it.

01:35.179 --> 01:36.930
He will remember.

01:38.098 --> 01:41.894
You are his blood.
He will not turn you away.

JAFAR: You must be worried sick
about Alice.

02:09.087 --> 02:12.174
I know how protective fathers are
when it comes to their children.

02:12.257 --> 02:13.842
Yes, of course.

02:13.926 --> 02:15.928
I remember when Alice came to us
at Bethlem.

02:16.011 --> 02:18.680
I've seen so many patients
over the years, but

02:19.515 --> 02:22.643
she was special. Obviously well cared for.

02:22.726 --> 02:24.603
I knew she must have come
from a loving home.

02:24.686 --> 02:26.188
That's very kind, Doctor,

02:26.271 --> 02:29.566
but can you tell me
where exactly it is she's gone to?

02:29.650 --> 02:32.819
It's better if I just show you.

02:39.409 --> 02:42.246
-Rabbit...
-Ah! Hello?

02:44.581 --> 02:47.918
If you're just gonna show me off,
was the bag really necessary?

02:48.794 --> 02:51.046
Is that a white rabbit?

02:52.130 --> 02:53.465
They're always in shock.

02:53.882 --> 02:55.801
Yes, I'm a white rabbit.

02:57.219 --> 02:59.054
Alice's father?

03:00.013 --> 03:02.266
Hmm. I don't see the resemblance.

03:39.428 --> 03:41.555
Thank you for your service.
Now be off with you.

03:41.638 --> 03:44.141
Are you sure you don't want me
to just stay and...

03:44.224 --> 03:46.185
Off. Now!

03:46.643 --> 03:50.314
All right, well,
you know where to find me. Unfortunately.

03:51.315 --> 03:54.526
Now, I'm sure you have many questions.

03:54.610 --> 03:55.944
It's not possible.

03:56.028 --> 03:58.113
I daresay it's a hallucination
of some kind.

03:58.197 --> 03:59.198
Or perchance a dream.

03:59.281 --> 04:01.325
I assure you, it is quite real, sir.

04:01.408 --> 04:04.119
As real as the bruises you feel
from that fall.

04:04.203 --> 04:05.913
As real as your daughter said it was.

04:05.996 --> 04:09.541
Every bit as wondrous,
and even more dangerous.

04:10.292 --> 04:12.628
It's truly no place for a young girl.

04:12.920 --> 04:15.589
There are dark forces in Wonderland, sir.

04:15.672 --> 04:18.675
Creatures. Villains.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.135
I tried to convince Alice to leave,

04:20.219 --> 04:23.972
but she associates me with
the hospital and won't listen.

04:24.056 --> 04:25.807
That's why I came to fetch you.

04:26.433 --> 04:29.061
What child doesn't want to be rescued
by their father?

04:31.063 --> 04:33.148
I'm sorry, but...

04:34.441 --> 04:38.820
I feel I might actually be
the last person Alice would listen to.

04:41.448 --> 04:43.450
-I don't understand.
-Alice and I...

04:43.534 --> 04:46.161
We've always had a difficult relationship.

04:46.995 --> 04:48.956
And after the way I treated her...

04:49.039 --> 04:50.791
I never believed in her.

04:51.792 --> 04:54.753
I don't see why
she would ever believe in me.

04:58.006 --> 04:59.174
That's a shame.

04:59.258 --> 05:01.510
I had hoped that there would be
a bond between you.

05:01.593 --> 05:04.513
In fact, I was counting on it.

05:08.308 --> 05:10.602
ALICE: Jafar's tower. It's so close.

05:10.686 --> 05:12.604
I could be with Cyrus by nightfall.

05:12.688 --> 05:14.439
But it's way up high
on a bloody mountain, right?

05:15.148 --> 05:16.149
So we'll hike.

05:16.233 --> 05:18.735
I'm just saying, we should
probably formulate some kind of plan.

05:18.819 --> 05:21.363
There are gonna be guards up there.
Big hairy ones, I reckon.

05:22.114 --> 05:25.158
And then if we do get inside,
we've got to find Cyrus.

05:25.242 --> 05:27.786
And if we do find Cyrus,
we've got to get out alive.

05:27.870 --> 05:29.746
Which, again, with the big hairy guards...

05:29.830 --> 05:33.792
Finding Cyrus is 99% of the battle.
The rest will take care of itself.

05:53.145 --> 05:54.188
ALICE: Oh, my!

05:55.105 --> 05:56.231
You were saying?

06:01.445 --> 06:04.990
We've searched the shore, Your Majesty.
There are no signs of Cyrus.

06:05.073 --> 06:08.035
Keep looking. He can't have just vanished.

06:10.495 --> 06:13.874
Actually, isn't vanishing
one of the things that genies can do?

06:13.957 --> 06:15.501
Shut up!

06:15.584 --> 06:18.420
He dove a thousand feet down
into the water below.

06:18.504 --> 06:21.673
Have you considered the possibility that

06:22.799 --> 06:24.551
he didn't survive the fall?

06:24.635 --> 06:27.763
Have you considered the possibility
that you are a lazy imbecile?

06:28.805 --> 06:30.265
Is that a rhetorical question?

06:30.349 --> 06:31.934
With Jafar out of Wonderland,

06:32.017 --> 06:34.520
I have the opportunity
to gain the upper hand.

06:34.978 --> 06:36.522
I already have the bottle.

06:36.855 --> 06:39.650
I want the genie
in my possession before Jafar...

06:39.733 --> 06:42.819
-What is it?
-Please continue, Majesty.

06:43.820 --> 06:46.240
"Before Jafar" what?

06:46.323 --> 06:50.786
Darling, there you are.
I have been worried sick.

06:50.869 --> 06:52.788
-Have you?
-Yes.

06:52.871 --> 06:55.749
You disappear without
so much as leaving a note.

06:55.832 --> 07:00.295
I don't have time for your games.
Just tell me where I can find Alice.

07:01.672 --> 07:03.382
I'd be quite happy to.

07:03.465 --> 07:06.093
She's easy to find,
unlike that genie of hers.

07:06.176 --> 07:07.761
What are you talking about?

07:07.845 --> 07:10.347
While you were gone,
your fancy silver prison

07:10.430 --> 07:12.474
developed a Cyrus-shaped hole.

07:12.558 --> 07:14.601
-The genie escaped?
-So it would appear.

07:15.352 --> 07:19.690
-Find him! I want every man...
-Jafar, my men answer to me.

07:19.773 --> 07:21.650
They already have their orders.

07:21.733 --> 07:25.612
The genie will be back in our hands
before the sun sets.

07:29.908 --> 07:31.577
Do not forget,

07:31.660 --> 07:33.912
even if you hold the genie and the bottle,

07:35.038 --> 07:36.665
you can't live out your twisted dreams

07:36.748 --> 07:38.667
without someone changing
the laws of magic.

07:39.668 --> 07:42.880
And I am the only one
who will have that power.

07:42.963 --> 07:44.548
Of course you are, darling.

-How did he do it?
-Does it matter? He's gone.

08:12.993 --> 08:16.079
It's only a matter of time
before he and the girl find each other.

08:16.163 --> 08:17.831
-And when they do...
-Silence!

08:17.915 --> 08:19.291
You are losing, Jafar.

08:21.126 --> 08:24.922
-I'm not the one in the cage.
-Are you certain of that?

08:42.773 --> 08:43.774
Where am I?

08:45.442 --> 08:49.780
I apologize for the restraints, old chap,
but it will make this part easier.

08:49.863 --> 08:50.864

15:07.282 --> 15:08.992
After you escaped the asylum,

15:09.076 --> 15:12.871
the way you just vanished,
it made no sense.

15:12.955 --> 15:14.039
But then...

15:14.665 --> 15:18.001
Then I remembered something else
that made no sense.

15:18.085 --> 15:19.711
Your stories.

15:19.795 --> 15:23.757
So I decided to do what you asked,
and believed.

15:24.633 --> 15:25.759
I did some research.

15:25.843 --> 15:28.428
It led me on a path
to an antiquities dealer

15:28.512 --> 15:33.600
who sold me a full-length mirror
rumored to have special properties.

15:34.226 --> 15:36.103
The rumors were true.

15:36.186 --> 15:39.648
I went through it.
I could feel sunshine on the other side,

15:39.940 --> 15:42.860
and a breeze. It was curious.

15:42.943 --> 15:43.944
Indeed.

15:44.319 --> 15:46.488
That's how
Anastasia and I came here as well,

15:46.572 --> 15:47.656

-I didn't.

15:55.497 --> 15:57.040
You found me, remember?

15:57.875 --> 16:00.919
I'd been wandering around for days
until you stumbled upon me.

16:01.003 --> 16:04.089
Either way, now what?

16:05.132 --> 16:10.929
I... I just want to
make it up to you for every...

16:11.013 --> 16:15.601
Make it up to me? Father,
you never treated me like a daughter.

16:16.185 --> 16:17.978
You treated me like an obligation,

16:18.061 --> 16:21.023
like a part of your life you had no choice
but to tolerate.

16:21.106 --> 16:24.735
Like that creaky step in the hall
that you never could fix.

16:24.818 --> 16:26.236
You just walked by it every day,

16:26.320 --> 16:28.197
wondering why
it wouldn't stop making the noise,

16:28.280 --> 16:30.824

16:43.712 --> 16:45.339
They were impossible to believe.

-I believe you now.
-(SCOFFS) Of course you do.

You just left me there

16:58.519 --> 17:02.564
in that madhouse, ignored me
like I didn't even exist.

17:02.648 --> 17:04.983
How could a father
treat their child like that?

17:06.735 --> 17:08.529
I said I didn't want to see you.

Mirza, explain the reason why
to our friend.

of Cyrus and the basket,

29:12.878 --> 29:16.465
I know of only one thing
that Jafar desires.

29:16.548 --> 29:19.843
And it's the one thing
that he shall never have.

29:26.517 --> 29:27.768
So tell me, Edwin,

29:27.851 --> 29:29.978
ever eaten something
that's tried to kill you before?

29:30.270 --> 29:31.897
No, Will, I don't believe I have.

29:32.481 --> 29:34.608
It's sort of a Wonderland rite of passage.

29:35.859 --> 29:38.111
-Here you go, Father.
-Thank you.

29:45.494 --> 29:46.703
That's not bad, actually.

29:48.580 --> 29:51.458
Not exactly a home-cooked meal,
but it will do.

29:51.750 --> 29:56.338
So, once you and Cyrus are reunited,
what then?

29:56.421 --> 29:58.173
Do you have a way
to get out of Wonderland?

29:58.257 --> 30:01.009
I do, actually, but one step at a time.

30:02.219 --> 30:04.638
Oh, Will, looks like the tide's come in.

30:04.930 --> 30:06.890
Could you help me move the wood
away from the water?

30:07.808 --> 30:08.892
Excuse us.

30:17.109 --> 30:19.069
Alice, I have to tell you.

30:19.319 --> 30:22.281
I don't thinking bringing your father
along with us is the best idea.

30:22.489 --> 30:24.074
I couldn't agree with you more.

30:24.241 --> 30:26.493
-Really?
-He's a problem.

30:26.577 --> 30:29.538
-Because he'll get in the way?
-Because he's not who he seems.

30:30.205 --> 30:33.959
Every meal I've ever had with my father
could not begin without saying grace.

30:34.418 --> 30:37.379
He'd say it before eating a piece of fruit
he picked from the garden,

30:37.838 --> 30:38.922
but not tonight,

30:39.214 --> 30:41.633
on a night he'd be
more grateful than ever.

30:48.849 --> 30:52.936
I don't know who that man is,
but he's not my father.
