00:32.491 --> 00:34.450
<i>Another world...</i>

00:34.618 --> 00:36.327
<i>... another time...</i>

00:36.495 --> 00:38.788
<i>... in the age of wonder.</i>

00:40.124 --> 00:43.835
<i>A thousand years ago,</i>
<i>this land was green and good...</i>

00:44.002 --> 00:46.838
<i>... until the Crystal cracked.</i>

00:47.005 --> 00:48.840
<i>For a single piece was lost...</i>

00:49.007 --> 00:51.217
<i>... a shard of the Crystal.</i>

00:52.720 --> 00:54.762
<i>Then strife began...</i>

00:54.930 --> 00:57.974
<i>... and two new races appeared:</i>

00:58.142 --> 01:00.810
<i>The cruel Skeksis.</i>

01:00.978 --> 01:03.271
<i>The gentle Mystics.</i>

01:07.985 --> 01:12.655
<i>Here in the castle of the Crystal,</i>
<i>the Skeksis took control.</i>

01:24.334 --> 01:27.712
<i>Now the Skeksis gather</i>
<i>in the sacred chamber...</i>

01:27.880 --> 01:32.383
<i>... where the Crystal hangs</i>
<i>above a shaft of air and fire.</i>

01:35.012 --> 01:37.805
<i>The Skeksis, with their hard</i>
<i>and twisted bodies...</i>

01:37.973 --> 01:40.475
<i>... their harsh and twisted wills.</i>

01:42.978 --> 01:46.230
<i>For a thousand years</i>
<i>they have ruled...</i>

01:46.398 --> 01:48.858
<i>... yet now there are only 10.</i>

01:50.194 --> 01:53.821
<i>A dying race</i>
<i>ruled by a dying emperor...</i>

01:53.989 --> 01:58.284
<i>... imprisoned within themselves</i>
<i>in a dying land.</i>

02:02.706 --> 02:05.708
<i>Today, once more</i>
<i>they gather at the Crystal...</i>

02:05.876 --> 02:09.920
<i>... as the first sun climbs</i>
<i>to its peak...</i>

02:10.088 --> 02:12.423
<i>... for this is the way of the Skeksis.</i>

02:12.591 --> 02:14.383
<i>As they ravage the land...</i>

02:14.551 --> 02:18.888
<i>... so, too, they learn</i>
<i>to draw new life from the sun.</i>

02:19.056 --> 02:22.225
<i>Today, once more,</i>
<i>they will replenish themselves...</i>

02:22.392 --> 02:24.227
<i>... cheat death again...</i>

02:24.394 --> 02:27.104
<i>... through the power</i>
<i>of their source...</i>

02:27.314 --> 02:30.107
<i>... their treasure, their fate:</i>

02:31.235 --> 02:33.569
<i>The Dark Crystal.</i>

02:47.125 --> 02:50.920
<i>But today, the ceremony of the sun</i>
<i>gives no comfort.</i>

02:51.088 --> 02:53.089
<i>Today, an emperor lies dying.</i>

02:53.882 --> 02:55.925
<i>Today, a new emperor...</i>

02:56.093 --> 02:58.386
<i>... must seize the throne.</i>

04:09.708 --> 04:13.544
<i>A thousand years ago,</i>
<i>the Crystal cracked.</i>

04:13.712 --> 04:17.298
<i>And here, far from the castle...</i>

04:17.466 --> 04:22.094
<i>... the race of Mystics came</i>
<i>to live in a dream of peace.</i>

04:24.806 --> 04:29.518
<i>Their ways were the gentle ways</i>
<i>of natural wizards.</i>

04:29.686 --> 04:32.396
<i>Yet now, there are only 10.</i>

04:32.606 --> 04:34.482
<i>A dying race...</i>

04:34.650 --> 04:39.820
<i>... numbly rehearsing the ancient ways</i>
<i>in a blur of forgetfulness.</i>

04:41.156 --> 04:42.657
<i>But today...</i>

04:44.034 --> 04:46.535
<i>... the ritual gives no comfort.</i>

04:46.703 --> 04:50.873
<i>Today the wisest of the Mystics</i>
<i>lies dying.</i>

04:52.125 --> 04:55.878
<i>Today they summon the one</i>
<i>who must save them.</i>

05:28.662 --> 05:30.913
<i>In the valley of the Mystics...</i>

05:31.081 --> 05:33.916
<i>... there lives a Gelfling, Jen.</i>

05:34.084 --> 05:37.920
<i>The Skeksis killed his family,</i>
<i>destroyed his clan.</i>

05:38.088 --> 05:39.964
<i>Only Jen survived...</i>

05:40.173 --> 05:44.051
<i>... to be raised by the wisest</i>
<i>of the Mystics.</i>

05:44.219 --> 05:47.138
<i>But there is a prophecy.</i>

05:47.305 --> 05:49.598
<i>A thousand years have passed...</i>

05:49.766 --> 05:54.103
<i>... and now once more the world</i>
<i>must undergo a time of testing.</i>

05:54.271 --> 05:56.230
<i>Now it must be healed...</i>

05:56.398 --> 06:00.067
<i>... or pass forever</i>
<i>into the rule of evil.</i>

06:00.235 --> 06:04.280
<i>At this time,</i>
<i>Jen is the chosen one.</i>

06:05.574 --> 06:08.325
<i>Today, Jen's pipe gives no comfort...</i>

06:08.493 --> 06:11.454
<i>... for today his master lies dying...</i>

06:11.621 --> 06:14.665
<i>... and a journey must begin.</i>

06:14.833 --> 06:17.877
<i>The journey of Jen.</i>

07:02.798 --> 07:04.882
Master?

07:05.050 --> 07:09.386
At the time
when three suns meet...

07:09.554 --> 07:11.305
Master, what's wrong?

07:11.473 --> 07:14.350
You are in danger...

07:14.518 --> 07:16.352
...Gelfling...

07:18.271 --> 07:21.482
...and I must leave you.

07:21.650 --> 07:23.901
Leave me?

07:24.069 --> 07:26.028
Master, no.

07:26.696 --> 07:31.659
Gelfling, I have told you
of the Skeksis.

07:32.828 --> 07:36.038
The Skeksis killed
my mother and father.

07:37.040 --> 07:40.501
The story runs deeper
than you know...

07:40.669 --> 07:43.838
...and you are part of it.

07:46.842 --> 07:48.884
I don't understand.

07:51.680 --> 07:54.849
The Skeksis will vow...

07:55.016 --> 07:56.976
...to destroy you...

07:58.520 --> 08:00.980
...for the prophecy says...

08:01.148 --> 08:03.941
...you must find the Shard...

08:05.360 --> 08:08.362
...the Crystal Shard.

08:08.530 --> 08:10.364
The Crystal Shard?

08:10.532 --> 08:13.701
To save our world, Gelfling...

08:13.869 --> 08:18.080
...you must find the Shard...

08:20.917 --> 08:24.962
...before the three suns meet.

08:26.089 --> 08:30.801
If not, Skeksis rule forever.

08:30.969 --> 08:33.053
Where is it?

08:34.431 --> 08:36.974
Aughra holds the Shard.

08:38.226 --> 08:41.770
Follow the greater sun for a day...

08:41.938 --> 08:44.857
...to the home of Aughra.

08:45.025 --> 08:47.818
There she knows...

08:47.986 --> 08:50.946
...all the secrets.

08:52.490 --> 08:56.076
Aughra? Follow the greater sun?

08:56.244 --> 08:59.663
But, master, I'm only a Gelfling.

08:59.873 --> 09:03.667
I should've told you these things...

09:03.877 --> 09:06.128
...long ago.

09:06.296 --> 09:08.589
Now it is up to you.

09:10.300 --> 09:13.636
Remember me, Jen.

09:13.803 --> 09:17.473
We may meet in another life...

09:19.184 --> 09:23.270
...but not again in this one.

09:32.822 --> 09:34.198
Master.

09:36.534 --> 09:38.285
Don't leave me.

10:21.037 --> 10:22.997
I hate your whimper.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.550
Quiet!

10:56.614 --> 11:00.200
He is not dead yet...

11:00.368 --> 11:02.703
...my Lord Chamberlain.

11:04.539 --> 11:06.206
Kneel!

11:06.374 --> 11:08.250
Bow!

11:14.382 --> 11:18.260
Mine!

11:22.098 --> 11:23.766
Back!

11:25.143 --> 11:26.602
I...

11:28.813 --> 11:34.068
I am still emperor.

11:34.235 --> 11:35.652
I...

12:28.706 --> 12:32.668
Oh, master, I'll go
where you send me...

12:34.629 --> 12:36.713
...though I barely understand.

13:13.501 --> 13:16.879
Dear friend, be well.

13:18.548 --> 13:20.799
Receive your belongings.

13:20.967 --> 13:23.552
Receive them serenely.

13:26.723 --> 13:29.683
Now we send forth Jen.

13:29.851 --> 13:32.436
Watch over his dangerous quest.

13:36.149 --> 13:38.358
<i>Dear, dear master...</i>

13:38.526 --> 13:40.527
<i>... I'll find the Shard.</i>

13:48.703 --> 13:51.121
<i>I'm not ready to go alone.</i>

13:54.709 --> 13:57.961
<i>All right. Alone, then.</i>

14:25.198 --> 14:28.283
The emperor is dead.

14:29.410 --> 14:32.788
Which one of us
will be the new emperor?

14:32.956 --> 14:37.334
Oh, yes, my Lord Chamberlain,
time to choose an emperor.

14:37.502 --> 14:39.253
It should be me.

14:39.420 --> 14:41.421
- Yes.
- Yes.

14:41.589 --> 14:44.925
Not him. I must rule.

14:46.719 --> 14:48.303
You should be the emperor.

14:48.471 --> 14:50.430
There's going to be a fight.

14:52.976 --> 14:55.978
It's time to make my move.

14:57.981 --> 15:00.274
It's me.

15:05.530 --> 15:07.114
We're all with you.

15:12.579 --> 15:16.415
- Chamberlain, no. Wait. Stop. You can't.
- Get back, spithead!

15:18.251 --> 15:20.002
Chamberlain!

15:20.169 --> 15:22.170
Lay down that sceptre!

15:30.013 --> 15:32.139
I challenge.

15:35.435 --> 15:37.728
Trial by stone.

15:38.646 --> 15:43.609
Trial by stone!

15:43.776 --> 15:46.778
- Slaves, raise the stone.
- Trial by stone!

15:46.946 --> 15:49.281
Get out there! Move!

15:49.490 --> 15:53.160
- Trial by stone!
- Let's pull that rope!

15:53.328 --> 15:56.038
Come on, slaves! Pull!

15:56.205 --> 15:58.206
Slaves, pull!

16:02.629 --> 16:04.546
Pull, pull!

16:05.256 --> 16:07.841
Harder! Pull!

16:42.960 --> 16:44.586
I'm taking it.

16:48.758 --> 16:50.425
Take the first blow, Chamberlain!

16:53.096 --> 16:55.931
You whimpering worm.

17:08.861 --> 17:10.779
He can't beat that.

17:12.865 --> 17:15.200
Let's see what you can do.

17:15.367 --> 17:16.952
You can do it!

17:28.840 --> 17:30.966
Good hit, Lord Chamberlain!

17:31.134 --> 17:32.926
Lord Chamberlain!

17:34.971 --> 17:37.931
Weak blow! Weak blow.

17:39.434 --> 17:41.476
- Weakling.
- General!

17:41.644 --> 17:43.895
The general's really mad now.

17:45.732 --> 17:47.482
- Come on, general!
- Watch out.

17:47.650 --> 17:48.984
Here he goes.

17:56.492 --> 17:59.161
Me, the emperor!

18:02.248 --> 18:06.168
The emperor lives!

18:12.842 --> 18:17.012
Now, by the law, he must pay.

18:21.476 --> 18:24.269
Stop. Stop him.

18:35.114 --> 18:37.199
Take him now!

18:44.791 --> 18:46.124
Get him.

18:50.004 --> 18:53.256
- Strip him!
- Now, let him go!

18:53.800 --> 18:56.510
The chamberlain is banished.

19:00.765 --> 19:02.599
- Away!
- Away!

19:03.893 --> 19:07.395
Now, bow down to me!

19:09.649 --> 19:13.610
I am emperor!

19:13.778 --> 19:16.530
Hail to the new emperor!

19:16.697 --> 19:20.075
- Hail!
- Hail!

19:20.243 --> 19:23.328
Hail to the new emperor!

19:23.496 --> 19:27.958
- Hail!
- Hail to the new emperor!

19:28.125 --> 19:32.045
Hail to the new emperor!

19:38.803 --> 19:40.595
Listen. The Crystal.

19:42.098 --> 19:44.766
- The Crystal calls.
- The Crystal.

19:44.976 --> 19:47.435
To the Crystal chamber!

19:49.480 --> 19:57.904
Hurry.

20:21.387 --> 20:23.138
A Gelfling alive?

20:23.306 --> 20:25.807
- A Gelfling.
- A Gelfling?

20:26.017 --> 20:28.602
- The prophecy.
- The prophecy.

20:28.769 --> 20:31.938
The prophecy says
Gelfling will destroy us.

20:32.565 --> 20:35.108
No. Garthim!

20:35.276 --> 20:37.110
Attack!

20:39.864 --> 20:43.533
Garthim soldiers,
find the Gelfling!

20:49.248 --> 20:51.833
Garthim!

20:52.001 --> 20:54.169
The Gelfling!

20:54.337 --> 20:57.255
Bring him to the castle!

20:59.717 --> 21:02.302
Garthim!

21:04.305 --> 21:07.515
Garthim, death to Gelfling!

21:10.478 --> 21:13.271
Go kill the Gelfling!

21:40.007 --> 21:43.802
- Ugly.
- Hideous Gelfling.

22:15.751 --> 22:17.544
<i>What in the world?</i>

22:18.921 --> 22:21.047
<i>This place is weird.</i>

22:21.924 --> 22:25.927
<i>Let's see.</i>
<i>Her name is Aughra.</i>

22:28.222 --> 22:31.433
<i>Follow the greater sun for a day...</i>

22:31.600 --> 22:34.019
<i>... to the home of Aughra.</i>

22:34.770 --> 22:37.105
<i>Some directions.</i>

22:37.273 --> 22:40.025
<i>Who is Aughra, anyway?</i>

22:40.192 --> 22:43.028
<i>One of these things?</i>

22:43.195 --> 22:45.113
<i>Maybe she murders Gelflings.</i>

22:46.615 --> 22:48.575
<i>What am I doing here?</i>

23:21.233 --> 23:24.319
Are you a Gelfling?

23:25.488 --> 23:27.822
Yes. My name is Jen.

23:30.117 --> 23:34.079
But Gelfling all dead. Garthim kill
them all. You can't be Gelfling.

23:34.246 --> 23:37.624
You look like Gelfling,
smell like Gelfling.

23:39.335 --> 23:42.504
- Maybe you are Gelfling.
- I'm looking for Aughra.

23:45.758 --> 23:49.636
- Who sent you?
- My master, wisest of the Mystics.

23:50.429 --> 23:52.055
Where is he? Around here?

23:52.223 --> 23:55.517
- He's dead.
- Could be anywhere, then.

23:56.393 --> 23:58.770
Are you Aughra?

23:59.230 --> 24:00.897
Are you afraid of me?

24:01.065 --> 24:04.776
Think I'm going to eat you?

24:04.944 --> 24:07.028
What do you want of me?

24:07.738 --> 24:10.448
A Shard. A Crystal Shard.

24:10.658 --> 24:14.285
Is that all you want?
A Crystal Shard?

24:16.914 --> 24:18.414
Drop him.

24:43.107 --> 24:44.732
Oh, no.

24:49.905 --> 24:55.410
Aughra?

25:37.328 --> 25:39.621
What's it for?

25:39.788 --> 25:44.000
Is that what you want to know? You
want to know what this is all about?

25:44.168 --> 25:47.295
Is that it, Gelfling?
You don't know?

25:47.463 --> 25:49.631
You've never looked at the heavens.

25:49.798 --> 25:52.091
Everything in the heavens is here...

25:52.259 --> 25:56.179
...moving as the heavens move.

25:56.597 --> 26:00.642
This is how to know when,
that's what.

26:01.560 --> 26:05.271
Suns, moons, stars.

26:05.439 --> 26:08.608
Yes, the angle of eternity.

26:09.109 --> 26:11.819
That's how I know it's coming.

26:11.987 --> 26:14.364
How else can I make the prediction?

26:15.616 --> 26:19.494
A thousand years ago,
there was a Great Conjunction.

26:19.703 --> 26:21.162
I was there.

26:21.330 --> 26:23.581
Three suns lined up.

26:23.749 --> 26:25.583
That's when the Crystal cracked.

26:25.751 --> 26:29.087
That's when the Skeksis appeared.
And the Mystics.

26:29.255 --> 26:31.339
Another Great Conjunction coming up.

26:31.507 --> 26:33.466
Anything could happen.

26:33.634 --> 26:35.510
Whole world might burn up.

26:36.679 --> 26:38.763
End of Aughra.

26:41.475 --> 26:44.727
Better have your Shard
before that, Gelfling.

26:46.188 --> 26:50.608
Now, ask what the Great Conjunction
is. What's the Great Conjunction?

26:51.694 --> 26:55.363
What's the Great Conjunction?
You tell me.

26:56.073 --> 26:59.867
The Great Conjunction
is the end of the world...

27:00.035 --> 27:01.494
...or the beginning.

27:03.872 --> 27:06.833
End, begin. All the same.

27:07.001 --> 27:08.543
Big change.

27:08.711 --> 27:10.795
Sometimes good.

27:10.963 --> 27:12.422
Sometimes bad.

27:13.215 --> 27:14.841
There it is.

27:17.011 --> 27:19.220
Gelfling knows nothing.

27:21.140 --> 27:24.142
Aughra, what do I do with the Shard?

27:24.310 --> 27:25.977
Heal the Dark Crystal.

27:26.145 --> 27:28.062
But how?

27:28.480 --> 27:30.565
Questions, questions.
Too many questions.

27:30.733 --> 27:32.734
Do you want a Shard? Here.

27:37.656 --> 27:39.574
Which one is it?

27:39.783 --> 27:47.915
Don't know.

27:48.709 --> 27:50.084
Listen, Gelfling.

27:50.252 --> 27:53.004
There is much to be learned...

27:53.172 --> 27:56.924
...and you have no time.

28:13.275 --> 28:16.069
<i>Which one? Which one is it?</i>

28:16.236 --> 28:19.072
<i>It's one of these three, I'm sure.</i>

28:19.239 --> 28:23.117
You've already taken too long,
Gelfling. Hurry.

28:24.244 --> 28:26.204
<i>But how do I choose?</i>

28:55.234 --> 28:58.027
Yes!

28:58.195 --> 29:02.198
Now you don't know what to do with it.
No one told you that, did they?

29:02.366 --> 29:04.909
But Aughra knows.

29:09.832 --> 29:11.290
Garthim!

29:20.467 --> 29:22.510
Out! Get out!

29:22.678 --> 29:25.179
Garthim, get out!

29:27.307 --> 29:28.808
Take your hands off...

30:18.400 --> 30:20.151
Aughra.

30:55.729 --> 30:58.814
At last, the Crystal calls.

30:58.982 --> 31:03.444
It is time.
Time to return to the castle.

32:26.028 --> 32:28.446
<i>Now I've got the Shard...</i>

32:28.614 --> 32:30.906
<i>... but what do I do with it?</i>

32:31.074 --> 32:32.700
<i>What is it?</i>

32:32.868 --> 32:35.494
<i>Am I supposed to take it somewhere?</i>

32:35.704 --> 32:38.581
<i>What's so special about this Shard?</i>

32:38.874 --> 32:40.833
<i>It doesn't look like any...</i>

32:56.224 --> 32:58.184
<i>I don't like this.</i>

34:19.725 --> 34:21.475
<i>Oh, no. Right in the mud.</i>

34:43.831 --> 34:45.248
Fizzgig.

34:58.513 --> 35:01.140
You Gelfling, like me?

35:01.308 --> 35:02.725
Well, yes.

35:02.893 --> 35:05.561
But I thought I was the only one.

35:05.729 --> 35:07.354
I thought I was.

35:11.526 --> 35:14.028
Here. I'll help you out.

35:16.072 --> 35:19.992
<i>- The first thing I remember is fire.</i>
<i>- Where did it start?</i>

35:20.160 --> 35:23.370
<i>It's a war, I think.</i>

35:23.538 --> 35:28.000
<i>A tree. My mother</i>
<i>puts me right inside, and we...</i>

35:28.168 --> 35:29.835
<i>Mother! Mother, the monster!</i>

35:30.003 --> 35:31.837
<i>First thing I remember</i>
<i>is the kind one.</i>

35:32.005 --> 35:36.175
<i>He picks me up. He makes the</i>
<i>monsters disappear, and I'd be safe.</i>

35:36.343 --> 35:38.219
<i>I am safe.</i>

35:38.386 --> 35:40.054
<i>What's happening?</i>

35:40.222 --> 35:43.140
<i>We're dream-fasting,</i>
<i>sharing our memories.</i>

35:45.060 --> 35:46.977
<i>I'm having a bath.</i>

35:47.145 --> 35:50.648
<i>When I was little,</i>
<i>I used to get fed by my new mom.</i>

35:50.816 --> 35:52.817
<i>- She called me Kira.</i>
<i>...and then bigger.</i>

35:52.984 --> 35:55.569
<i>And master showed me</i>
<i>the whole valley stretching out.</i>

35:55.737 --> 35:58.239
<i>I thought it went on forever.</i>
<i>Kira, watch out!</i>

35:58.406 --> 36:00.908
<i>The Garthim!</i>
<i>They capture the Podlings.</i>

36:01.076 --> 36:02.618
<i>- Then I am happy.</i>
<i>- It makes me cry.</i>

36:02.786 --> 36:06.247
<i>My master is family,</i>
<i>teacher and friend.</i>

36:06.414 --> 36:08.582
<i>And I can nearly forget</i>
<i>everything that happened.</i>

36:08.750 --> 36:10.918
<i>And talk with flowers</i>
<i>and the living things.</i>

36:11.086 --> 36:13.420
<i>He shows me numbers</i>
<i>and things called words.</i>

36:13.588 --> 36:16.757
<i>Everywhere I go,</i>
<i>I learn the shapes of kindness.</i>

36:16.925 --> 36:20.302
<i>I learn from them all,</i>
<i>except there's no one here like me.</i>

36:20.470 --> 36:22.096
<i>I need to find...</i>

36:22.264 --> 36:25.140
<i>I love them all,</i>
<i>except I need to find...</i>

36:25.308 --> 36:26.642
<i>- Wait.</i>
<i>- I want...</i>

36:26.810 --> 36:28.769
<i>- It's going away.</i>
<i>- It's going away.</i>

36:32.440 --> 36:34.817
Oh, no. I'm sinking.

36:34.985 --> 36:37.945
- Don't move.
- Don't move? Where would I go?

37:02.095 --> 37:04.972
- What is that?
- Just a Nebrie.

37:05.140 --> 37:06.974
She won't hurt you.

37:10.645 --> 37:11.979
Kira.

37:13.356 --> 37:15.274
Your name is Kira.

37:15.483 --> 37:18.485
We were dream-fasted, you and I.

37:19.821 --> 37:21.655
Fizzgig.

37:23.533 --> 37:25.826
Come on.

37:31.917 --> 37:33.667
Fizzgig!

37:38.340 --> 37:41.675
- You seem very strange to him.
- He seems pretty strange to me.

37:41.843 --> 37:43.218
He's nervous.

37:43.386 --> 37:47.222
Here, Skeksis are watching always.
We must go.

37:48.683 --> 37:50.100
Come.

38:04.950 --> 38:09.954
- Roast Nebrie, my favourite.
- Roast Nebrie. I want the rare piece.

38:16.503 --> 38:17.878
Slaves.

38:28.723 --> 38:31.225
You slime face!

39:02.298 --> 39:03.841
Rotten!

39:08.930 --> 39:11.098
Slaves!

39:11.266 --> 39:12.558
Eat!

39:22.861 --> 39:25.154
It seems to me that Gelfling...

39:26.448 --> 39:28.407
...has escaped, huh?

39:28.575 --> 39:32.828
No Gelfling ever escaped
from my deadly Garthim.

39:38.376 --> 39:41.211
More food. More food!

39:43.173 --> 39:46.133
Something stuck in my teeth.

39:49.179 --> 39:50.679
Enchanting meal.

40:08.448 --> 40:10.991
Dessert! Crawlies!

40:11.159 --> 40:13.660
Dessert!

40:13.828 --> 40:16.747
- Stop it!
- Crawlie!

40:25.882 --> 40:28.467
Not bad at all.

40:29.511 --> 40:32.888
Look. The Garthim return.

40:33.056 --> 40:34.515
The Gelfling.

40:49.864 --> 40:52.282
Release the Gelfling.

41:00.416 --> 41:03.168
- What's this?
- Fools! Skeksis fools!

41:03.336 --> 41:05.254
What do you want with me?

41:06.256 --> 41:07.548
This is no Gelfling!

41:08.383 --> 41:12.553
Of course I'm no Gelfling,
you putrid lizards!

41:12.720 --> 41:14.721
I'll get my eye to you.

41:16.641 --> 41:19.768
She was with him.
She helped him. Where is he?

41:20.145 --> 41:24.064
Gone! Gelfling gone.
Stupid Garthim.

41:25.358 --> 41:28.443
You want Gelfling, why not ask me?

41:28.611 --> 41:31.905
Easier to send your crab-brained
soldiers, burn my home!

41:32.115 --> 41:36.368
Now home gone, Gelfling gone.
Nothing but Aughra!

41:36.536 --> 41:39.371
Mouldy mildew mother of mouthmuck!

41:39.539 --> 41:41.206
Dangle and strangle to death!

41:41.374 --> 41:43.417
Oh, how crude!

41:43.585 --> 41:47.421
Watch your tongue, harridan.
We are lords of the Crystal.

41:47.589 --> 41:49.423
Lords? Not for long.

41:49.591 --> 41:51.633
What about the prophecy...

41:51.801 --> 41:54.052
...that a Gelfling
will end Skeksis power?

41:57.182 --> 42:00.559
He'll come, make you crawl,
like the worms you are.

42:00.727 --> 42:04.438
Find that Gelfling now!

42:04.606 --> 42:06.607
Crystal bats, fly!

42:06.774 --> 42:09.109
Search the land!
Search the water!

42:09.277 --> 42:11.653
Search the sky!

43:31.567 --> 43:33.777
Jen, get down. Down.

43:47.709 --> 43:50.544
- What was that?
- A Crystal bat.

43:50.712 --> 43:53.297
What they see, the Skeksis see too.

43:53.464 --> 43:56.091
- Did it see us?
- No, I don't think so.

44:32.503 --> 44:35.839
Aren't these the people
from your memory?

44:36.007 --> 44:39.551
When the Garthim killed my parents,
the Podlings adopted me.

44:39.719 --> 44:41.136
They're my clan.

44:52.106 --> 44:53.857
Come.

45:18.549 --> 45:20.467
How do you say, "Thank you"?

46:04.887 --> 46:08.765
You know the three suns in the sky?
They're going to come together soon.

46:08.933 --> 46:11.601
It's called the Great...
The Great something or other.

46:11.769 --> 46:14.521
It's a prophecy. He told me
that I must find the Shard...

46:14.689 --> 46:18.316
...and that everything must be done
before the three suns join in one.

46:18.484 --> 46:21.153
And that's all.
And then he died.

46:32.123 --> 46:34.624
Jen, what's the Shard for?

46:34.792 --> 46:37.210
That's just it. I don't know.
I found the Shard.

46:37.378 --> 46:39.838
But you don't know
what to do with it.

47:42.026 --> 47:44.236
Jen, this way!

47:55.456 --> 47:58.166
Through here! Hurry!

48:44.672 --> 48:46.590
Come on. Run.

48:48.384 --> 48:51.303
- What was that creature?
- Skeksis.

49:19.540 --> 49:22.542
Wait! They won't find us here.

49:30.134 --> 49:32.761
- It's all my fault.
- That Skeksis...

49:34.096 --> 49:36.389
He saved us from his own Garthim.

49:38.351 --> 49:41.645
First Aughra's, then your village.

49:47.568 --> 49:50.362
I wish I'd never heard
of this Shard.

49:50.529 --> 49:52.238
No, Jen!

49:55.242 --> 49:57.869
Jen, they hurt your arm.

49:58.037 --> 50:00.789
Here. This moss'll make it better.

50:05.252 --> 50:07.504
It wasn't your fault.

50:09.590 --> 50:12.300
The Garthim have always come.

50:36.117 --> 50:39.744
<i>Oh, master, I remember the valley.</i>

50:39.912 --> 50:42.205
<i>I didn't understand.</i>

50:42.373 --> 50:46.876
<i>I miss the other masters</i>
<i>with the old, old magic and chants.</i>

50:47.044 --> 50:49.129
<i>I never loved them enough.</i>

50:49.296 --> 50:51.798
<i>Out here in the world, look at me.</i>

50:51.966 --> 50:55.927
<i>I'm not a hero,</i>
<i>not the way you wanted.</i>

50:56.095 --> 50:59.431
<i>Master, nothing is simple anymore.</i>

50:59.598 --> 51:02.434
<i>Master? Master?</i>

51:05.104 --> 51:07.439
Where are we?

51:07.606 --> 51:09.566
- Safe.
- Safe?

51:11.360 --> 51:13.361
I don't think
anywhere is safe anymore.

51:24.331 --> 51:25.999
These are ruins.

51:27.877 --> 51:31.045
They're the houses
of the old ones.

51:31.213 --> 51:33.673
You mean our ancestors?

51:41.223 --> 51:44.976
Jen? Here's the Shard.

51:48.189 --> 51:50.648
I can feel something.

51:50.816 --> 51:55.487
- Hear it almost.
- We don't go in here anymore.

51:55.654 --> 51:58.740
Bad things happened in here once.

52:00.075 --> 52:03.077
But they were Gelfling,
like us.

52:03.245 --> 52:04.829
Yes.

52:04.997 --> 52:08.833
They were all killed
by the Skeksis long ago.

52:47.248 --> 52:50.959
Kira. Kira, look here.

52:52.461 --> 52:54.170
Just look at this.

52:54.338 --> 52:57.173
That... That looks
just like the Shard.

52:57.341 --> 52:59.259
What does it mean?

52:59.426 --> 53:01.678
And what are those funny marks?

53:01.846 --> 53:04.347
This is all writing.

53:04.515 --> 53:06.057
What's writing?

53:06.225 --> 53:09.143
Words that stay.
My master taught me.

53:11.021 --> 53:14.399
"When single shines
the triple sun...

53:14.567 --> 53:17.819
...what was sundered and undone...

53:17.987 --> 53:20.989
...shall be whole, the two made one...

53:21.198 --> 53:25.577
...by Gelfling hand, or else by none."

53:25.744 --> 53:28.955
By Gelfling hand?
Do you know what that means?

53:29.123 --> 53:31.040
Wait.

53:31.208 --> 53:33.668
This is a piece of the Dark Crystal.

53:33.836 --> 53:36.796
- Then that's what my master meant.
- Yes.

53:36.964 --> 53:40.133
- I have to put it...
- You've to heal the... The Dark Crystal.

53:40.301 --> 53:41.968
Prophecy?

53:42.136 --> 53:45.221
- Jen, Skeksis!
- Stay! Stay! No!

53:45.431 --> 53:48.474
Stay. Stay. Am friend.

53:50.185 --> 53:51.895
Stay. Am friend.

53:52.062 --> 53:55.231
Prophecy.
Prophecy cause all this trouble.

53:55.399 --> 53:56.774
- That prophecy?
- Yes!

53:56.942 --> 53:59.652
- That's why Skeksis killed Gelfling?
- Yes!

53:59.820 --> 54:04.365
Yes. Bad mistake.
Skeksis afraid, fear Gelfling.

54:04.575 --> 54:06.326
But you're a Skeksis.

54:06.493 --> 54:09.370
But I am friend,
save you from Garthim.

54:10.122 --> 54:12.707
- Why?
- Don't listen to him. It's a trick.

54:12.875 --> 54:15.543
No! Please! Must listen.

54:15.711 --> 54:17.253
Am outcast.

54:17.421 --> 54:20.340
If I make peace,
am outcast no more.

54:20.507 --> 54:22.842
- Will you stop the Garthim attacks?
- Yes!

54:23.010 --> 54:25.553
Please, come to the castle.
Please!

54:25.763 --> 54:27.639
Show them you want peace.

54:27.806 --> 54:32.477
Show them Gelflings will not harm us.
Please, please.

54:32.645 --> 54:37.190
- Please.
- Jen! No!

54:38.233 --> 54:40.109
Come. Please.

54:40.277 --> 54:42.528
Please. Yes. Please?

54:44.865 --> 54:46.783
- Yes.
- No!

54:47.034 --> 54:49.077
Come on, Kira.

54:49.244 --> 54:51.537
No! Wait!

54:52.331 --> 54:54.248
Wait, please?

54:54.416 --> 54:56.459
Please? Wait!

54:56.627 --> 54:59.295
Please make peace!

55:01.340 --> 55:04.592
Now I know what I have to do.
How do I get to the castle?

55:04.760 --> 55:06.594
I'll show you.

55:24.363 --> 55:26.072
Over here!

55:27.408 --> 55:30.326
- What's that?
- It's a landstrider.

55:34.415 --> 55:37.750
- How did you learn to call them?
- The Podlings taught me.

55:45.426 --> 55:47.135
Don't be afraid.

55:50.597 --> 55:53.057
Let's go.

55:57.229 --> 55:59.355
- They'll take us.
- But...

55:59.940 --> 56:01.816
Kira, you don't have to go.

56:03.277 --> 56:04.777
I know.

56:06.280 --> 56:08.072
All right. Together, then.

56:16.331 --> 56:18.041
No, Fizzgig. You stay here.

56:25.132 --> 56:27.008
Oh, all right. Come on.

56:32.639 --> 56:36.392
- Hang on, Jen. They go fast.
- Yes.

56:46.236 --> 56:48.321
The prophecy didn't say
anything about this.

56:49.323 --> 56:51.657
Prophets don't know everything.

57:23.982 --> 57:26.400
Silence, animals!

57:26.568 --> 57:29.112
You're next, little Podling.

57:36.870 --> 57:38.621
This won't hurt.

57:38.789 --> 57:42.875
We just want to drain
your living essence.

57:43.043 --> 57:46.796
Then you can be the same
as the other Podlings here:

57:46.964 --> 57:48.798
A slave.

57:49.758 --> 57:51.467
Open the wall!

57:55.472 --> 57:57.390
Now, Podling.

58:01.812 --> 58:05.731
Out there is the great shaft
of the castle.

58:06.066 --> 58:08.943
Position the reflector.

58:12.114 --> 58:14.448
The reflector
will capture the beams...

58:14.616 --> 58:17.577
...of the Dark Crystal
floating high above.

58:17.744 --> 58:20.913
Look into the reflector, Podling.

58:21.081 --> 58:24.750
Feel the power of the Dark Crystal.

58:30.424 --> 58:33.593
Yes! And now the beam
will rid you...

58:33.760 --> 58:36.012
...of your fears, your thoughts...

58:36.471 --> 58:39.056
...your vital essence.

58:52.613 --> 58:54.363
You're very lucky, slave.

58:54.573 --> 58:57.867
Only the emperor
can drink your essence.

59:05.500 --> 59:08.461
He's here! Close it, slave!

59:13.717 --> 59:16.177
- Is it ready?
- Very fresh.

59:16.345 --> 59:18.721
Very strong, sire.

59:29.524 --> 59:32.485
Oh, it will make you
young again, sire.

59:51.338 --> 59:53.047
Young!

59:54.967 --> 59:56.884
Yes, young!

01:00:05.519 --> 01:00:07.728
You fraud!

01:00:08.772 --> 01:00:11.315
Wait. Please, sire.

01:00:14.027 --> 01:00:16.320
Liar!

01:00:16.488 --> 01:00:18.322
Slave squeezer!

01:00:18.490 --> 01:00:20.741
It always worked...

01:00:20.909 --> 01:00:23.828
...better when we used Gelflings.

01:00:45.017 --> 01:00:48.060
- Look.
- The ones who raided your village.

01:00:48.228 --> 01:00:50.104
Let's go.

01:00:53.567 --> 01:00:55.067
Kira.

01:01:06.413 --> 01:01:08.039
Come on.

01:01:17.924 --> 01:01:20.426
Kill him! Get him!

01:01:28.643 --> 01:01:32.104
- Kira, are you all right?
- Yes, but we've got to get them out.

01:01:57.714 --> 01:01:59.131
Hurry!

01:02:01.885 --> 01:02:03.719
They're coming!

01:02:05.722 --> 01:02:07.306
Fizzgig.

01:02:11.812 --> 01:02:13.813
Hang on.

01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:29.912
Wings.

01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:32.123
I don't have wings.

01:02:32.290 --> 01:02:34.166
Of course not.

01:02:34.334 --> 01:02:36.252
You're a boy.

01:02:56.148 --> 01:02:58.816
Yes. A way into the castle.

01:02:58.984 --> 01:03:01.694
This must lead
into the lower part.

01:03:01.862 --> 01:03:04.530
- Come on.
- I don't want to go in there.

01:03:04.698 --> 01:03:06.824
We have to go on.

01:03:25.051 --> 01:03:26.677
Fizzgig, come on.

01:04:01.254 --> 01:04:02.755
Careful.

01:04:20.023 --> 01:04:21.941
Which way now?

01:04:22.150 --> 01:04:26.111
I want to go back.
I smell death here.

01:04:30.116 --> 01:04:32.952
I know, but we have no choice.

01:04:35.747 --> 01:04:38.624
- Skeksis!
- I knew you would come.

01:04:39.918 --> 01:04:45.089
Do not be afraid.
I am here to help you. Yes.

01:04:45.298 --> 01:04:49.969
Come, we'll show them. Gelflings
live with Skeksis together in peace.

01:04:50.136 --> 01:04:51.804
Please.

01:04:52.013 --> 01:04:55.683
- No. Don't!
- Let go!

01:04:58.186 --> 01:05:00.854
I'll show them.

01:05:04.943 --> 01:05:06.735
My hand!

01:05:07.654 --> 01:05:10.322
So, my hand.

01:05:17.831 --> 01:05:19.832
Gelfling, you die!

01:05:22.961 --> 01:05:26.171
Jen! Let go.

01:05:26.339 --> 01:05:28.340
Let go of me.

01:05:28.508 --> 01:05:32.177
- Jen.
- Come. Yes.

01:05:33.179 --> 01:05:36.056
- Let go!
- Now. Yes.

01:05:36.224 --> 01:05:38.892
Gelfling, come.

01:05:39.185 --> 01:05:41.061
No, Fizzgig.
You stay with Jen.

01:05:41.229 --> 01:05:42.813
- Yes.
- Let go.

01:05:43.607 --> 01:05:46.734
Let go! Let go of me! Jen!

01:05:53.074 --> 01:05:56.410
I like those grey ones that go mushy
when you put them on your fork.

01:05:56.578 --> 01:05:59.038
Chamberlain.
Chamberlain, get out.

01:05:59.205 --> 01:06:01.123
Get out.

01:06:02.751 --> 01:06:06.086
- Gelfling! Gelfling!
- Gelfling! Gelfling!

01:06:13.845 --> 01:06:17.931
- Gelfling! Gelfling in the castle!
- Gelfling!

01:06:23.063 --> 01:06:26.482
Come and look!
Such an ugly monster!

01:06:33.573 --> 01:06:36.116
Awful. So awful.

01:06:41.873 --> 01:06:45.793
Royal sire,
I bring you Gelfling.

01:06:49.547 --> 01:06:51.757
I have done this.

01:06:51.925 --> 01:06:55.594
I have caught her.
I bring you the Gelfling.

01:06:55.762 --> 01:06:59.682
I was wounded.
I suffered horrible, searing pain.

01:07:00.350 --> 01:07:02.893
A live Gelfling.

01:07:04.270 --> 01:07:07.606
Kill her!
We are sworn to kill all Gelflings!

01:07:07.774 --> 01:07:09.858
No! She's mine!

01:07:10.944 --> 01:07:15.572
But, sire,
you could drink her essence.

01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:18.951
Because of the prophecy,
we must kill the Gelfling!

01:07:20.620 --> 01:07:23.831
No. First we take her essence,
then kill.

01:07:26.376 --> 01:07:28.877
- Drain her first, then kill her.
- Drain her!

01:07:29.045 --> 01:07:32.005
Let's take her essence. Yes.

01:07:33.425 --> 01:07:35.968
Essence.
Drain her essence.

01:07:42.308 --> 01:07:44.101
Take her essence.

01:07:44.310 --> 01:07:47.563
As for the whimpering Chamberlain,
return his robes to him.

01:08:20.764 --> 01:08:23.055
Silence. Silence, animals.

01:08:40.617 --> 01:08:42.618
There.

01:08:42.868 --> 01:08:44.661
Yes.

01:09:28.581 --> 01:09:31.457
Yes. Essence of Gelfling.

01:09:35.380 --> 01:09:38.381
Kira, fight them.

01:09:38.550 --> 01:09:41.134
Fight them. Fight.

01:09:41.344 --> 01:09:43.136
Jen?

01:09:43.304 --> 01:09:45.180
Jen!

01:09:45.682 --> 01:09:48.015
You, Kira, call the animals.

01:09:48.184 --> 01:09:51.728
You have the gift.
Call them to freedom. Loud.

01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:58.360
Quiet, Gelfling. Be quiet.

01:10:16.045 --> 01:10:19.298
Quiet, all of you.

01:10:19.465 --> 01:10:24.511
- Stop. Stop. I warn you.
- Gelfling, free me.

01:10:49.954 --> 01:10:53.332
All of you, get down!

01:11:12.268 --> 01:11:15.354
No! No!

01:11:51.391 --> 01:11:56.228
You've come too late, Gelfling.
The Great Conjunction is at hand.

01:11:56.396 --> 01:11:59.147
Now the Skeksis will have power
over the stars!

01:12:01.150 --> 01:12:02.776
When is the Conjunction?

01:12:02.944 --> 01:12:05.570
Very soon, three suns touch.

01:12:06.614 --> 01:12:08.156
Jen.

01:12:09.826 --> 01:12:11.576
Go, Gelfling...

01:12:11.744 --> 01:12:14.079
...I fear, to death.

01:12:31.264 --> 01:12:33.598
Get down, Fizzgig.
Quiet.

01:12:38.563 --> 01:12:41.106
Yes. Big help you've been.

01:12:51.617 --> 01:12:52.993
Oh, no.

01:12:56.122 --> 01:12:57.456
Now where am I?

01:12:58.207 --> 01:12:59.666
Fizzgig!

01:13:06.841 --> 01:13:08.633
Garthim.

01:14:01.938 --> 01:14:04.272
Is that the Crystal?

01:14:37.932 --> 01:14:41.017
- Aughra, you're alive.
- No time.

01:14:41.185 --> 01:14:44.312
No time.
"When single shines the triple sun."

01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:45.730
Where's Kira?

01:14:52.155 --> 01:14:54.614
"The Great Conjunction comes."

01:15:56.802 --> 01:15:59.763
Yes. The Crystal.

01:17:09.083 --> 01:17:11.001
<i>This is what I came for.</i>

01:17:12.420 --> 01:17:15.046
<i>The Dark Crystal.</i>

01:17:17.842 --> 01:17:19.676
<i>The Three Suns.</i>

01:17:23.639 --> 01:17:25.557
<i>The Shard.</i>

01:18:37.463 --> 01:18:39.172
- Kira.
- Jen.

01:18:50.559 --> 01:18:53.853
The Great Conjunction comes.

01:18:56.065 --> 01:19:00.527
Now we will live forever.

01:19:01.570 --> 01:19:18.169
We will live forever.

01:19:21.465 --> 01:19:24.384
- Gelfling.
- A Gelfling.

01:19:25.678 --> 01:19:27.679
Down, down. Fizzgig, no.

01:19:27.847 --> 01:19:30.640
The Gelfling must die.

01:19:32.476 --> 01:19:34.352
Kill her!

01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:36.438
She will destroy us!

01:19:38.149 --> 01:19:42.277
Gelfling, you die!

01:19:44.613 --> 01:19:45.697
Two Gelfling.

01:19:53.831 --> 01:19:55.999
- Garthim!
- Garthim!

01:19:56.167 --> 01:19:58.168
Garthim!

01:20:12.516 --> 01:20:14.058
No!

01:20:16.020 --> 01:20:17.979
The Shard!

01:20:20.691 --> 01:20:22.609
The Shard is mine.

01:20:27.198 --> 01:20:29.449
Let go, smelly hairball!

01:20:32.369 --> 01:20:34.245
Fizzgig!

01:20:40.211 --> 01:20:42.253
She has the Shard.

01:20:44.423 --> 01:20:46.216
Take it from her. Now.

01:20:47.343 --> 01:20:48.510
Watch out, Kira!

01:20:54.016 --> 01:20:57.268
- Kira, behind you!
- Get off!

01:20:57.436 --> 01:20:59.604
No! Leave her alone!

01:20:59.772 --> 01:21:02.273
Give us the Shard
and you can go free.

01:21:02.733 --> 01:21:05.902
- No.
- Yes! Just don't harm her.

01:21:06.987 --> 01:21:10.240
No, Jen.
Heal the Crystal.

01:21:10.407 --> 01:21:11.908
Kira.

01:21:27.967 --> 01:21:29.300
Jen.

01:21:38.060 --> 01:21:39.310
Kira.

01:21:46.235 --> 01:21:47.860
- Gelfling, no!
- No!

01:23:32.174 --> 01:23:34.300
How did you get out there?

01:23:38.847 --> 01:23:40.765
Come on, then.

01:25:22.284 --> 01:25:24.327
"What was sundered and undone...

01:25:24.495 --> 01:25:28.456
...shall be whole,
the two made one."

01:25:37.049 --> 01:25:40.343
And now the prophecy...

01:25:40.511 --> 01:25:43.179
...is fulfilled.

01:25:45.849 --> 01:25:48.810
We are again...

01:25:48.977 --> 01:25:51.145
...one.

01:26:03.617 --> 01:26:05.451
Many ages ago...

01:26:05.619 --> 01:26:09.080
...in our arrogance and delusion...

01:26:09.248 --> 01:26:13.918
...we shattered the pure Crystal...

01:26:14.086 --> 01:26:17.463
...and our world split apart.

01:26:20.259 --> 01:26:23.553
Your courage and sacrifice...

01:26:23.720 --> 01:26:27.306
...have made us whole...

01:26:27.474 --> 01:26:32.270
...and restored the true power
of the Crystal.

01:26:35.107 --> 01:26:38.276
Hold her to you.

01:26:38.443 --> 01:26:40.945
She is part of you...

01:26:41.113 --> 01:26:45.199
...as we all are part
of each other.

01:27:10.893 --> 01:27:12.935
Now we leave you...

01:27:13.103 --> 01:27:15.396
...the Crystal of Truth.

01:27:16.982 --> 01:27:19.317
Make your world...

01:27:19.484 --> 01:27:21.485
...in its light.
