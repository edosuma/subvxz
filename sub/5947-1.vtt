00:37.100 --> 00:40.265
A Federal Grand Jury in
Detroit today charged

00:40.278 --> 00:43.454
the thirteen top leaders
of 'the Weathermen'

00:43.455 --> 00:47.112
with plotting to bomb public buildings
in Chicago, Detroit, New York,

00:47.217 --> 00:48.797
and Berkeley, California.

00:48.897 --> 00:52.859
'The Weathermen' are the militant faction
of the Students for a Democratic Society,

00:52.960 --> 00:55.885
only one of the thirteen is now in custody.

00:58.894 --> 01:01.601
Never before has this
nation fought a war which

01:01.702 --> 01:05.292
so many Americans opposed
for so many different reasons.

01:06.394 --> 01:09.735
Never has this dissent been
as emotional, as intense,

01:09.836 --> 01:12.578
as is the dissent against
the war in Vietnam.

01:18.219 --> 01:21.553
The bomb went off in the State Department
and did a lot of damage

01:21.654 --> 01:23.733
another was detonated in Oakland.

01:30.013 --> 01:34.270
Three suspects remain at large
after a security guard was shot and killed

01:34.372 --> 01:36.233
during a robbery at
the Bank of Michigan.

01:36.292 --> 01:37.971
The FBI has released the names

01:38.072 --> 01:41.401
Mimi Lurie, Nicholas Sloan,
and Sharon Solarz;

01:41.601 --> 01:46.197
All members of the radical anti-war group,
'The Weather Underground'.

02:16.095 --> 02:18.699
Come on you guys, let's go.

02:18.900 --> 02:20.350
Bye Mom.

02:20.363 --> 02:21.825
Don't forget I have
practice after school.

02:21.926 --> 02:24.446
What are you still practicing for?
You already got into college.

03:20.226 --> 03:21.731
- ...take out.
- Thank you sir, have a good one!

03:21.832 --> 03:23.232
- Hey!
- Hey.

03:24.122 --> 03:26.388
That's $25.74, do you
want that warmed up?

03:26.401 --> 03:28.677
No, Thanks.

03:42.928 --> 03:46.625
- Don't move! Hands in the air!
- Don't move, Federal agents!

03:47.846 --> 03:50.361
Get on the car!
Hands behind your back!

03:50.462 --> 03:54.933
Sharon Solarz, you are under arrest for
the murder of Hugh Kroessna,

03:55.033 --> 03:58.262
You have the right to remain silent,
if you give up that right, anything you say

03:58.463 --> 04:00.471
can and will be used against
you in a court of law.

04:00.572 --> 04:02.132
You have the right to an attorney,

04:02.234 --> 04:05.167
if you cannot afford one,
one will be provided for you.

04:05.168 --> 04:07.059
Do you understand these rights?

04:07.260 --> 04:10.688
Sharon Elizabeth Solarz,
one of the longest-standing fugitives

04:10.689 --> 04:12.563
on the FBI's most wanted list

04:12.664 --> 04:15.992
was arrested yesterday, just
outside Heatherton, New York.

04:16.093 --> 04:18.889
30 years after the notorious
Bank of Michigan robbery

04:18.890 --> 04:21.390
- that claimed the life of a guard.
- Good morning, Jess.

04:21.790 --> 04:22.967
You're late.

04:22.968 --> 04:25.081
Well, if I'm not here
they can't fire me, right?

04:26.390 --> 04:28.682
- You look beautiful!
- Thanks.

04:33.379 --> 04:35.362
Look at that.

04:35.462 --> 04:38.395
National story, right in our own
backyard, and where were we?

04:38.796 --> 04:40.350
Hold on. Crime was
Yukanowitz's, you fired him.

04:40.363 --> 04:41.927
Yeah, and I passed
it on to you.

04:42.028 --> 04:45.154
Along with the courts and the State house
and like 55 other things, I mean...

04:45.255 --> 04:46.792
This... is news, Ben.

04:46.793 --> 04:48.293
This!

04:50.768 --> 04:53.826
We're a goddamn newspaper!
Remember?

04:54.954 --> 04:57.130
So why don't you go out and
write a nice little story

04:57.143 --> 04:59.330
that informs our readers,
while we still have a few?

04:59.431 --> 05:01.005
I'm sorry, okay?

05:03.502 --> 05:05.106
It's that bad?

05:06.827 --> 05:09.273
Do you still have your friend
in the FBI field office?

05:11.299 --> 05:14.261
In theory, although I'm not sure she
ever wants to speak to me again.

05:15.686 --> 05:17.147
Y' keep telling me you're
a good reporter, right?

05:17.160 --> 05:18.633
Right.

05:19.733 --> 05:21.333
Prove it.

05:24.420 --> 05:27.349
These were major radicals, Ben,
who know how to hide.

05:27.550 --> 05:31.234
So how does the FBI
find her after 30 years?

05:37.430 --> 05:41.221
So, let me s... the State wants to sieze
private property in transfer, right?

05:42.021 --> 05:44.692
Y... Yes, I know what 'imminent domain' is.

05:45.992 --> 05:47.659
I will if I have to.

05:47.760 --> 05:49.585
Court of Appeals exist for a reason.

05:49.610 --> 05:51.140
- Izzy!
- Yeah.

05:51.241 --> 05:52.641
You'd better be getting ready.

05:56.086 --> 05:59.053
And you're saying that
satisfies public use?

06:00.669 --> 06:02.001
Really?

06:02.303 --> 06:03.703
Izzy! You ready?

06:03.804 --> 06:04.704
Yeah.

06:04.902 --> 06:06.436
Come on, we're gonna be late.

06:07.037 --> 06:10.066
- We're not gonna be late.
- You wanna bet?

06:16.717 --> 06:20.616
My client bought it from his dad,
who bought it from his dad,

06:20.717 --> 06:23.425
and hopes one day to
sell it to his son.

06:24.326 --> 06:27.297
It's a great family, I'm sure
the jury would enjoy meeting them.

06:31.117 --> 06:32.717
Okay.

06:34.318 --> 06:35.900
Right on time!

06:35.901 --> 06:37.602
- All set?
- Yup.

06:38.302 --> 06:39.868
You got your lunch?

06:41.670 --> 06:43.170
No...

06:54.424 --> 06:58.069
- So, what's last, math?
- No, I've got volleyball practice...

06:58.070 --> 07:00.932
- Okay. I'll pick you up after practice.
- Okay.

07:10.363 --> 07:13.217
Hey, what's your hurry?
Haven't you forgotten something?

07:15.522 --> 07:16.504
Billy.

07:16.505 --> 07:18.105
- Hi, Mr. Cusinamo.
- Hi, sweetie!

07:18.205 --> 07:22.471
- Are your kids a little old for this school?
- I came to see you... you seen the news?

07:22.672 --> 07:26.217
- They're still reporting the news!
- Sharon Solarz.

07:26.318 --> 07:27.884
Go ahead, go ahead.

07:27.989 --> 07:30.600
- You know who she is, right?
- What?

07:30.650 --> 07:33.418
She was busted, man. She was
arrested over in Heatherton.

07:33.918 --> 07:36.131
- Why are you telling me this?
- 'Cause Sharon's an old friend.

07:36.232 --> 07:37.880
Are you in trouble, Billy, y'
know, or are you still on parole?

07:37.893 --> 07:39.553
I'm clean, man.

07:39.852 --> 07:41.391
What's going on?

07:43.295 --> 07:45.028
She called me, wanting to
turn herself in to the Feds.

07:45.041 --> 07:46.785
They're assholes,
they don't care!

07:46.886 --> 07:49.578
- But you can't get involved in someth...
- She's a friend, she needs a lawyer.

07:49.592 --> 07:50.863
Well, I can't give advice...

07:50.876 --> 07:52.159
They knew exactly where she
was gonna be, Jim, alright?

07:52.169 --> 07:53.360
Exactly. They knew.

07:53.390 --> 07:55.561
- They knew exactly.
- Well, this is outa my league.

07:55.562 --> 07:56.562
Out of my league.

07:57.866 --> 07:59.992
- I can't let her twist in the wind.
- I can't do it.

08:00.891 --> 08:02.812
I have a kid that just lost her mom.

08:03.514 --> 08:05.414
It's been a year...

08:07.763 --> 08:09.297
Sorry.

08:10.998 --> 08:12.498
Call Maggie Hart,

08:13.502 --> 08:16.235
Lockwood and Dunlop, Philly.

08:17.035 --> 08:20.265
Okay? She's great. Better'n me.

08:21.098 --> 08:22.710
Sorry.

08:29.357 --> 08:31.553
Please set it here.

08:34.645 --> 08:36.267
Go ahead.

08:36.368 --> 08:38.190
So... you moved her this morning?

08:38.390 --> 08:41.349
Why do you care? I thought
you were covering politics now.

08:41.450 --> 08:43.220
Well, I'm multi-talented.

08:43.520 --> 08:46.233
How come she was arrested here if she's
been a Vermont housewife for thirty years?

08:46.334 --> 08:47.641
You'll have to ask her that.

08:47.651 --> 08:49.041
You know, it's funny you
should mention it, Dee

08:49.052 --> 08:51.813
'cause from what I hear people give
jailhouse interviews all the time.

08:54.067 --> 08:54.597
Who do you think you are,
The New York Times?

08:54.897 --> 08:58.096
You say New York Times like it's 1985
and you're still impressed.

08:58.197 --> 08:59.925
You're just a local
beat reporter.

08:59.938 --> 09:01.676
I love it when you do
that with your hair.

09:04.448 --> 09:07.801
This is a national news story, I think
you should go home and tweet about it.

09:07.902 --> 09:10.405
- I don't tweet.
- Right! You don't email either.

09:10.507 --> 09:13.110
Can I just see the case file?
For old times' sake? Please?

09:13.211 --> 09:17.082
Just because we hooked up in college
I'm gonna give you access to FBI wiretaps?

09:17.798 --> 09:21.548
- Wiretaps? What wiretaps?
- This is why I don't talk to you.

09:21.748 --> 09:23.394
And we didn't just "hook up"
in college, okay, we were...

09:23.407 --> 09:25.062
I have to go.

09:25.591 --> 09:27.915
- New sheriff in town?
- How can you tell?

09:28.016 --> 09:29.635
Well, that's how it usually goes, right?

09:29.736 --> 09:31.557
Big case like this, they usually
bring in someone from out of town?

09:31.757 --> 09:33.220
Grab all the glory?

09:33.421 --> 09:35.517
Course, the local field office should
at least get credit in the local paper.

09:35.617 --> 09:37.501
Why don't I go put in a good word for you!
I'm a very social guy...

09:37.601 --> 09:40.632
- Billy Cusimano.
- Organic grocery guy?

09:41.234 --> 09:43.206
It didn't come from me.

09:43.219 --> 09:45.779
No, just a well-placed, extremely
attractive government source.

09:47.489 --> 09:50.510
Cusimano.

09:56.651 --> 10:00.586
- Hey Dad! Here?
- Yeah.

10:03.087 --> 10:04.387
Hello!

10:12.044 --> 10:13.643
Billy Cusimano?

10:13.945 --> 10:16.878
My name's Ben Shepard,
from the Albany Sun-Times,

10:17.179 --> 10:19.820
I wanted to ask you a few questions
about the Sharon Solarz arrest?

10:20.313 --> 10:22.488
You can, but why would
I comment about that?

10:22.501 --> 10:24.686
Well, you know her, don't you?

10:25.288 --> 10:26.575
No, I don't.

10:28.725 --> 10:32.809
Quick search of police records shows you
and Sharon together in Mendocino in 1971.

10:33.009 --> 10:34.196
I've never been to Mendocino.

10:34.897 --> 10:36.657
That's not true, is it? You
were dealing hash there

10:36.670 --> 10:38.442
for an outfit called the
Brotherhood of Eternal Love.

10:38.642 --> 10:40.952
Which is a great name, by the way.

10:41.552 --> 10:43.144
Sharon been in touch recently?

10:44.365 --> 10:47.194
Look, I know she called
you prior to her arrest.

10:47.693 --> 10:50.730
- You talked to Jim Grant.
- No, I talked to the FBI, who's Jim Grant?

10:50.932 --> 10:52.313
Who is the FBI?

10:52.326 --> 10:53.717
Well, they had you on a
wiretap here for a while,

10:53.819 --> 10:56.664
so it seems you're growin' somethin' more
than tomatoes and potatoes here, Billy.

10:56.766 --> 11:01.973
Shit. That's why I pay taxes, right? So
Big Brother can... hack my fuckin' phone!

11:02.074 --> 11:04.475
- Who's Jim Grant?
- He's a lawyer, man.

11:04.574 --> 11:07.883
- Lawyer? Sharon's?
- Nah, he wouldn't take the case.

11:07.884 --> 11:08.884
Look, kid...

11:09.075 --> 11:10.468
Sharon called me wanting
to turn herself in...

11:10.481 --> 11:11.884
Turn herself in?

11:11.984 --> 11:15.416
Nope, I'm not saying anything else.
Everything here is off the record.

11:15.517 --> 11:17.178
See... it doesn't work that way.
You gotta say

11:17.191 --> 11:18.863
"off the record" before
we have the conversation.

11:18.963 --> 11:21.146
- Who says?
- Those are the rules.

11:21.247 --> 11:23.455
There's rules for what you people do?

11:46.337 --> 11:50.012
- So, what did she say?
- She said that I did great

11:50.112 --> 11:52.320
and that she was very impressed.

11:54.258 --> 11:55.570
What'd I tell you?

12:01.649 --> 12:04.649
- Yeah?
- Hi... is this Mr. Grant?

12:04.751 --> 12:06.670
This is Ben Shepherd from
the Albany Sun-Times?

12:06.683 --> 12:08.612
Yes.

12:08.713 --> 12:11.313
Just wondering if you care to comment
on the Sharon Solarz arrest?

12:12.293 --> 12:15.014
- What?
- The Sharon Solarz arrest, you declined to take her case...

12:15.122 --> 12:17.240
Yeah, you know... I'm
just sitting down to

12:17.253 --> 12:19.381
dinner right now. I gotta
call you back, okay?

12:19.481 --> 12:20.682
Sir... I ju...

12:29.369 --> 12:31.555
As the turbulent decade drew to a close

12:31.657 --> 12:34.160
the Students for a Democratic Society,

12:34.261 --> 12:36.794
the leading student group
opposed to the war in Vietnam,

12:36.895 --> 12:39.643
had its power usurped by
a more militant faction,

12:39.656 --> 12:42.415
known as the Weather
Underground Organization.

12:42.816 --> 12:45.211
Frustrated with years
of non-violent protests

12:45.312 --> 12:47.191
that had failed to end the war,

12:47.292 --> 12:49.458
the so-called "Weathermen"
decided the best

12:49.471 --> 12:51.649
way to stop America's
involvement in Vietnam

12:51.950 --> 12:53.754
was to bring the war home.

12:53.855 --> 12:56.591
The Weathermen radicalized
the anti-war movement,

12:56.693 --> 13:00.293
and carried out a series of bombings
against government institutions including

13:00.393 --> 13:04.071
bombing the Pentagon, the U.S. Capitol,
and the State Department.

13:04.372 --> 13:08.368
No group has been more successful
in carrying out attacks on U.S. soil.

13:18.036 --> 13:20.535
- What's wrong?
- Nothin'.

13:20.736 --> 13:23.778
- You look weird.
- I'm fine, honey.

13:24.812 --> 13:28.040
- You're lying.
- I'm not lying...

13:28.241 --> 13:31.261
You are lying, because you're smiling.

13:31.262 --> 13:35.321
- I'm not smiling.
- "I'm not smiling."

13:35.424 --> 13:40.395
Well maybe I'm happy?
Here. Come on, eat.

13:40.925 --> 13:43.038
And then get ready.

13:49.571 --> 13:51.271
- Hey!
- Hey.

13:51.572 --> 13:55.018
- You Jim Grant, by chance?
- Not by chance.

13:55.639 --> 13:58.598
Would you follow up on those
counter-signatures from Roger?

13:58.599 --> 13:59.699
Yep.

14:00.111 --> 14:01.769
I'm Ben Shepherd, Albany
Sun-Times, we spoke on the phone.

14:01.782 --> 14:03.450
I just figured I'd
come by and say hi...

14:03.551 --> 14:05.427
I don't really have anything to say...
And Susan,

14:05.440 --> 14:07.327
would you pull out the
Rochester files for...?

14:07.427 --> 14:10.430
- You don't know what I'm gonna ask you yet.
- The report for my deposition? Do what?

14:10.531 --> 14:12.539
I said you don't know what
I'm gonna ask you yet.

14:13.440 --> 14:14.916
Well, you're a reporter.

14:15.116 --> 14:17.357
Well, I could just put "Refused
to answer any questions."

14:17.515 --> 14:20.246
- What?
- I'm just doing a little background, sir.

14:25.524 --> 14:29.984
- Okay.
- - Thank you!

14:38.747 --> 14:41.277
No, no... we're off the record here.

14:41.476 --> 14:43.764
- Which part?
- All of it...

14:43.868 --> 14:47.726
whatever it is we're gonna be talking
about here, otherwise, you can leave now.

14:47.927 --> 14:49.715
No, that's fine.
It's not important.

14:53.644 --> 14:56.798
So, did Sharon Solarz contact you
prior to her arrest?

14:57.398 --> 15:00.741
Does it matter?
Since you already printed that she did?

15:00.845 --> 15:02.760
Actually, what was printed was
that she may have approached

15:02.773 --> 15:04.698
a public-interest lawyer who
declined to take the case.

15:04.799 --> 15:06.411
But your name was never mentioned.

15:11.883 --> 15:13.892
There are 25 lawyers in the area.

15:13.992 --> 15:16.900
Nine do criminal,
six do accidents,

15:17.000 --> 15:19.712
five do deeds, and four do closings...
and then there's me.

15:19.813 --> 15:22.017
- I wasn't insinuating...
- The hell with accuracy?

15:22.618 --> 15:24.439
Be vague, be accusatory, and whatever sticks?
Is that how it works?

15:24.452 --> 15:26.283
Nothing I wrote was false.

15:26.384 --> 15:28.938
You made it seem like I was
harboring a known fugitive.

15:30.739 --> 15:34.923
- We can issue a correction.
- Sharon Solarz... did not contact me,

15:35.135 --> 15:37.622
and I have no involvement in her case.

15:37.723 --> 15:39.222
- Really?
- Really.

15:40.223 --> 15:43.352
Do you know she's now being represented
by a Margaret Hart in Philadelphia?

15:43.452 --> 15:45.180
Right.

15:45.193 --> 15:47.153
Ms. Hart was a classmate
of yours in law school?

15:48.232 --> 15:49.911
Lawyers know each other,
that's news?

15:50.012 --> 15:52.544
Yeah, but you did refer Ms. Hart
as counsel, didn't you?

15:53.145 --> 15:55.679
- Says who?
- Ms. Hart herself, this morning.

15:56.079 --> 15:58.996
Maggie Hart is one of the best
defense lawyers in the country.

15:59.096 --> 16:01.899
But why pass this off? I mean,
that's what doesn't make sense to me.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.239
Cases like this don't
come around very often,

16:03.252 --> 16:04.503
I'm sure I don't have
to tell you that.

16:04.605 --> 16:07.424
'Cause Sharon Solarz deserves a
better defense than I can provide.

16:07.526 --> 16:09.916
Deserves? That's
an interesting word choice.

16:10.316 --> 16:14.200
You know, it may seem untrue to you,
but we do live in a free country

16:14.300 --> 16:16.696
and people are entitled to
a decent defense.

16:16.897 --> 16:18.676
Now look, I got work to do.

16:19.177 --> 16:21.072
You've handled First Amendment cases,

16:21.173 --> 16:23.045
labor cases, you worked
hand-in-glove with the ACLU...

16:23.046 --> 16:25.046
I mean, this is right in
your wheelhouse, isn't it?

16:25.619 --> 16:28.186
- Is this what you came here to talk about?
- I'm not sure yet.

16:29.998 --> 16:33.156
Well, that pretty well sums up why
journalism is dead. Now, do you mind?

16:33.256 --> 16:36.373
- Why did Billy Cusimano come to you?
- I don't know.

16:36.574 --> 16:38.073
Well, how well do you
know Billy Cusimano?

16:38.074 --> 16:38.973
I don't, really.

16:38.974 --> 16:41.586
I mean... you do, really.
You represented him a few years back,

16:41.587 --> 16:44.824
- on a drug case, you got him off.
- I represent a lot of people, Jesus...

16:45.525 --> 16:48.857
Mist... Look, I'm not trying to
offend you, Mr. Grant, I'm...

16:48.958 --> 16:52.078
I'm not offended. You're
pretty much exactly what I expected.

16:52.079 --> 16:54.092
Susan, I'll call you from the car.

16:56.493 --> 16:57.693
Sir...

16:57.717 --> 16:59.497
Mr. Grant... look, I'm just trying
to put the pieces together.

16:59.510 --> 17:01.300
Hey. Look, look... Listen...

17:02.409 --> 17:05.842
I didn't take the case because I'm a
single parent with a private practice

17:05.943 --> 17:07.517
and too much on my plate, alright?

17:07.617 --> 17:09.200
If I could have helped, I would've.

17:09.402 --> 17:12.730
Because you are sympathetic to their cause?
You agree with her tactics?

17:13.031 --> 17:15.301
You know, clearly you have
some kind of an agenda here,

17:15.303 --> 17:17.076
- I don't have time for this bullshit.
- I don't, actually...

17:17.077 --> 17:18.438
I don't care much for either side.

17:19.281 --> 17:21.166
So, what? That makes you fair and balanced?

17:22.069 --> 17:25.010
You know... it's a funny thing.
Thirty years ago, a smart guy like

17:25.022 --> 17:27.973
you probably would've been involved
with the movement yourself.

17:29.374 --> 17:32.412
I hope you get what you're
looking for, kid. Take care.

17:57.518 --> 17:58.919
Thank you.

18:26.567 --> 18:29.274
Hold one sec'... hang on.

18:29.492 --> 18:32.930
- Thank you for doing this.
- No worries, mate. I got you.

18:33.031 --> 18:34.130
Thank you.

18:55.007 --> 18:56.482
Hey, guys!

18:56.582 --> 19:00.382
- Sorry I'm late.
- Not a problem, we're having fun.

19:02.716 --> 19:04.936
- You do your homework?
- Of course.

19:05.236 --> 19:08.474
Good... Thank you.

19:09.173 --> 19:10.960
I'm the one who did it.

19:12.361 --> 19:14.546
Well, thank you.

19:22.821 --> 19:27.030
- She's getting better every day.
- Yeah...

20:58.845 --> 20:59.845
Hey.

21:00.646 --> 21:02.888
I'm sorry, can you walk me through
that research, please? - Yeah.

21:02.988 --> 21:03.988
Thank you.

21:06.372 --> 21:08.987
It's... all basic stuff,

21:09.088 --> 21:11.604
He was born in
Bakersfield, California...

21:11.617 --> 21:14.142
attended Iowa State University,

21:14.143 --> 21:16.512
University of Virginia Law...
met his wife

21:16.525 --> 21:18.905
while working at the...
Planet... Earth...

21:18.906 --> 21:20.643
- Earth First Foundation?
- Yeah...

21:20.644 --> 21:22.968
and came up here,
started his own practice.

21:23.769 --> 21:25.981
This his wife?
What happened to her?

21:26.582 --> 21:29.403
Car accident. 48-years-old.

21:29.407 --> 21:30.802
That's horrible.

21:30.903 --> 21:33.013
Yeah, you meet a younger
woman, you have a kid...

21:33.026 --> 21:35.148
she's not supposed
to die on ya'...

21:35.749 --> 21:39.103
supposed to meet a car salesman
and move to Vegas, like mine did.

21:39.304 --> 21:42.128
- Anything else?
- House is paid for,

21:42.229 --> 21:44.103
he's obviously a responsible
single parent...

21:44.204 --> 21:46.816
pillar of society, do-gooder...
lot of pro bono work...

21:46.916 --> 21:50.467
Right. So basically, nothing I can
turn into a story. Great.

22:26.069 --> 22:27.069
Hello, Dan?

22:27.170 --> 22:29.919
I can not believe you're calling me!

22:29.920 --> 22:32.383
- I know.
- This is a goddamn nightmare...

22:32.384 --> 22:35.245
- Dan...
- I don't want anything to do with this.

22:35.246 --> 22:38.059
Dan, you're my brother.
I need your help.

22:42.739 --> 22:44.414
Go ahead.

23:08.362 --> 23:10.890
Ray, who's your best reporter?

23:11.695 --> 23:13.782
- Mansfield.
- Mansfield?

23:13.783 --> 23:15.266
Bullshit.

23:16.696 --> 23:18.582
- Please, have a seat.
- Look...

23:18.583 --> 23:21.616
So, at first I think Grant is trying to
link up with the others,

23:21.717 --> 23:24.420
help negotiate a deal, bring them in,
like Solarz tried.

23:24.521 --> 23:27.237
- Yeah, well... that would make a good story.
- It gets so much better...

23:27.338 --> 23:29.334
So I go and I look at the man's history,

23:29.534 --> 23:32.133
right, see if he has any known
associations to the Weathermen.

23:32.634 --> 23:34.205
- Nothing.
- So?

23:34.405 --> 23:37.979
Nothing on the man at all...
the man doesn't exist before 1979.

23:38.581 --> 23:39.947
Look at this...

23:41.085 --> 23:44.851
I had it wrong, Ray. He's dead.

23:47.644 --> 23:51.115
Jim Grant is not trying to represent
Mimi Lurie or Nick Sloan.

23:51.814 --> 23:55.241
Jim Grant is Nick Sloan.

23:58.999 --> 24:00.715
I'm tired.

24:00.728 --> 24:02.848
I know, sweetheart, but we
have to get an early start.

24:02.853 --> 24:06.200
- For school?
- No, we're not going to school.

24:06.300 --> 24:09.616
- Then where are we going?
- Well, we're gonna go on a little trip.

24:09.617 --> 24:10.992
A trip?

24:15.451 --> 24:18.379
Breaking news this morning
from the Albany Sun-Times

24:18.380 --> 24:20.765
reporting former seventies
radical fugitive

24:20.778 --> 24:23.175
Nicholas Sloan has been
discovered in Albany,

24:23.276 --> 24:25.883
living as a lawyer
named James Grant.

24:25.985 --> 24:30.418
Sloan is wanted for murder, and has been
on the run for more than thirty years.

24:32.019 --> 24:34.515
Alright people, what do we have on Grant?

24:34.619 --> 24:38.160
His EasyPass paid a toll at 4 this morning
on I-87, heading north,

24:38.161 --> 24:39.944
the border's already been alerted.

24:40.357 --> 24:41.861
We have an agent talking
to his secretary.

24:41.874 --> 24:43.390
Why don't we have a
better picture of Grant?

24:43.391 --> 24:46.286
- We're working on it.
- Well, what about from his house?

24:46.287 --> 24:48.807
Just waiting on the warrant.

24:56.508 --> 24:58.429
Their bodies are so bendy.

24:59.334 --> 25:00.850
Do you know this one's name?

25:03.812 --> 25:06.312
Border security cams are still being
checked, there's no matches yet.

25:06.413 --> 25:09.737
- Does Grant have any family?
- A daughter, 11.

25:09.838 --> 25:12.538
- Is she with him? Call the school.
- She didn't show.

25:12.539 --> 25:14.642
Both parents deceased,
brother in New York.

25:14.842 --> 25:16.147
Alright, put a tail on the brother,

25:16.148 --> 25:20.060
I want bank accounts, credit cards,
tracked not frozen.

25:20.260 --> 25:21.943
Where are we on the Title three?

25:22.344 --> 25:24.838
I wanna bug every place
this guy is known to go, I mean...

25:24.839 --> 25:28.373
somebody, somewhere knows something,
and someone's going to talk.

25:28.374 --> 25:31.419
Now, come on people, this guy's been
making us look bad for thirty years now.

25:31.620 --> 25:33.016
Let's not be stupid.

25:34.240 --> 25:35.839
Welcome to the Rosewood.

25:37.541 --> 25:39.541
- May I take those, sir?
- No thanks, we're fine.

25:39.642 --> 25:41.242
Right this way...

25:53.067 --> 25:55.563
Just one moment...

26:03.759 --> 26:04.843
- There you go!
- Thank you.

26:05.043 --> 26:07.856
- Enjoy your stay, Mister Graves.
- Thank you.

26:46.205 --> 26:47.880
What's that?

26:53.806 --> 26:57.351
- What happened?
- It's behind the napkin.

26:57.352 --> 26:59.735
- What?
- "What?"

27:00.048 --> 27:02.027
Evil eyes.

27:02.132 --> 27:04.053
So, tell me something... what...

27:05.994 --> 27:08.310
What was the best thing
that happened to you today?

27:08.911 --> 27:13.402
Well... I got a pet seal,

27:13.503 --> 27:15.711
well, not pet seal,
but a little seal doll.

27:16.512 --> 27:18.533
And does it... did you give it a name?

27:19.333 --> 27:20.758
I named her Harper.

27:21.204 --> 27:26.334
- Harper? Why Harper?
- Yeah... 'Cause it's a harbor seal...

27:26.834 --> 27:28.951
Har-bor.

27:28.964 --> 27:31.091
Yeah. So it's Harper. Harbor.
Harper. Harbor.

27:31.092 --> 27:34.571
I get the connection. So, right...
well where is it? Where's Harper?

27:36.472 --> 27:38.968
Not there.

27:41.431 --> 27:44.684
Somethin' you should love you
should keep close to, you know?

27:46.523 --> 27:50.273
- We're disappointed in you.
- You're disappointed in me!

28:12.557 --> 28:16.096
Daniel Sloan is on the move,
we're tracking him.

28:47.660 --> 28:50.370
See you soon.

29:18.189 --> 29:21.205
Daniel Sloan has stopped at
the Rosewood Hotel.

29:21.206 --> 29:23.601
We're keeping a safe distance.

30:12.773 --> 30:14.977
You two canvas the stairs.

30:15.798 --> 30:17.219
You take the elevators.

30:22.573 --> 30:24.753
Hey, what's that noise?

30:25.903 --> 30:27.390
It's a goddamn fire alarm.

30:27.791 --> 30:30.303
Okay, lock down the building now,
no one goes in or out.

30:30.403 --> 30:31.687
Not if there's a fire.

30:36.846 --> 30:39.545
Daddy? Dad!

30:40.275 --> 30:42.776
Come on!

30:48.513 --> 30:51.274
- Okay, what the hell is happening?
- They're evacuating the building.

30:51.496 --> 30:54.480
Shit! It's a diversion!

30:55.181 --> 30:57.080
Contact the local police
and fire department,

30:57.181 --> 30:59.672
notify them that we have
a dangerous fugitive,

30:59.773 --> 31:01.755
send them a description of Nicholas Sloan.

31:01.956 --> 31:03.363
Alright, what do we have on
the brother, and where is he?

31:03.376 --> 31:04.794
I have no idea...

31:05.194 --> 31:08.577
and the place is completely jammed,
and there's too many people... I can't...

31:08.678 --> 31:10.203
I got him! East stairwell!

31:10.502 --> 31:12.170
Don't move! Stay right there!

31:12.180 --> 31:16.011
- Monroe's got him! Don't move!
- I'm her uncle! The girl is my niece.

31:16.112 --> 31:19.465
- I'm her guardian, I have papers.
- Let me see!

31:21.841 --> 31:24.862
Don't be scared,
it's okay, honey.

31:27.779 --> 31:30.304
He's got custody papers,
it's Sloan's daughter.

31:30.705 --> 31:32.315
Jesus Christ.

31:32.328 --> 31:34.048
Alright, he handed her
off, he can't be far.

31:34.051 --> 31:36.217
Send the second team down to the basement,

31:36.218 --> 31:38.035
and post two officers outside.

31:55.515 --> 31:57.996
Charles, around the corner.
You come with me.

31:58.009 --> 32:00.499
Eyes on the crowd.

32:01.220 --> 32:04.277
Subway! Woods,
let's check the subway.

32:33.939 --> 32:37.681
- Nothin' here.
- Let's go.

32:37.785 --> 32:42.682
- Sir, we can't find him.
- Come on, people.

32:54.149 --> 32:55.755
Sir, how long have you been in
contact with Nicholas Sloan?

32:55.768 --> 32:57.385
No comment.

32:57.487 --> 33:00.828
- Is that his daughter?
- No comment! I wanna get her home.

33:01.029 --> 33:03.289
Fugitive terrorist Nicholas
Sloan had apparently

33:03.302 --> 33:05.574
been practicing law in
Albany for three decades,

33:05.675 --> 33:08.124
under the name James Grant,
before he was exposed

33:08.137 --> 33:10.596
recently by a reporter
from the Albany Sun-Times.

33:10.696 --> 33:13.646
This shit should already be over.
We need better intel.

33:13.947 --> 33:15.224
We've grilled the brother.

33:16.026 --> 33:17.580
Have we gotten anything
out of Sharon Solarz?

33:17.593 --> 33:19.159
No, she's refusing to talk.

33:19.359 --> 33:21.839
She'll talk to the local reporter,
she's already said.

33:21.977 --> 33:28.310
- Well, what do we know about him?
- He's... nothing reporter, local.

33:29.201 --> 33:31.794
Okay... let's get him in.

33:37.290 --> 33:39.194
- Can you try and pull it together?
- Of course.

33:39.195 --> 33:41.596
- I'm serious. Cornelius is already pissed.
- Yeah.

33:45.158 --> 33:47.310
Hello there.

33:47.323 --> 33:49.486
I'm Special Agent Cornelius,
you must be Shepherd.

33:49.586 --> 33:50.586
Yep.

33:50.587 --> 33:54.874
The prisoner is considered dangerous,
you do not accept anything from her.

33:54.875 --> 33:57.265
No letters, packages, or
messages of any kind.

33:57.278 --> 33:59.680
Your time starts now.

34:06.217 --> 34:08.306
Hello.

34:08.319 --> 34:10.418
You're much younger
than I thought you'd be.

34:10.719 --> 34:12.719
Well, that's always nice to hear.

34:13.318 --> 34:15.339
I didn't mean it as a compliment.

34:21.239 --> 34:22.951
Well... still, thank you.

34:22.964 --> 34:24.884
You did me a favor when
you wrote that article.

34:25.094 --> 34:26.880
I wouldn't mistake it for sympathy.

34:26.982 --> 34:29.637
No... just clarity.

34:29.762 --> 34:33.737
Yeah... clarity.
So, let's talk clarity.

34:33.737 --> 34:34.938
Okay.

34:36.036 --> 34:38.117
You were on your way to
New York to turn yourself in?

34:38.858 --> 34:41.358
How does Billy Cusimano fit in?

34:41.371 --> 34:43.882
Billy's my friend, and he did
nothing but encourage me to...

34:43.984 --> 34:47.330
turn myself in if I thought that
that would bring me peace.

34:47.542 --> 34:54.170
- You know his phone was tapped?
- Yeah. They got lucky.

34:58.101 --> 35:00.423
- And you got unlucky.
- Yeah.

35:00.731 --> 35:02.727
Why now, after thirty years?

35:04.365 --> 35:09.465
- You don't have kids, do you?
- No, I... I barely have furniture.

35:10.202 --> 35:13.252
Well, if you do, you
realize that they change you.

35:15.416 --> 35:19.257
I have two, a boy and a girl...

35:19.883 --> 35:25.632
and I waited until I thought they were
old enough to be able to handle it,

35:26.132 --> 35:30.508
but still young enough that... I can...

35:37.513 --> 35:39.851
So was it a crisis of conscience?

35:43.335 --> 35:46.385
Remorse for past transgressions
that became intolerable?

35:48.964 --> 35:52.698
The past thirty years in a sentence!

35:54.072 --> 35:57.936
It must be nice to see
the world so cleanly.

35:58.753 --> 36:00.540
Didn't you once?

36:04.782 --> 36:09.616
Most of us led very sheltered lives,
we had no real relationship with violence.

36:10.720 --> 36:16.778
But at that time, all these...
kids were... taking to the streets

36:16.979 --> 36:22.005
in Japan, and France, China, Angola,

36:23.646 --> 36:25.955
There was revolution, and I
wanted to be part of it.

36:26.154 --> 36:29.264
Sure! Sounds groovy.

36:31.034 --> 36:37.076
You think we were all just a...
bunch of doped up hippies running around.

36:38.223 --> 36:41.244
It was hardly groovy,

36:41.565 --> 36:45.243
our government was murdering millions,
and we could see...

36:45.544 --> 36:49.814
horrifying images, on the news...
magazines,

36:50.215 --> 36:52.703
My Lai, Selma...

36:52.911 --> 36:55.383
made us crazy, we didn't
know what to do, we...

36:57.403 --> 37:02.320
we protested, we sat in,
we got our sculls cracked

37:02.421 --> 37:05.557
and the war just kept escalating.

37:05.958 --> 37:10.433
And then there was Kent State,
and Jackson State, and...

37:10.734 --> 37:17.230
kids our age... were being murdered
by our government... on campuses.

37:18.347 --> 37:23.281
- It's not our finest hour.
- It wasn't abstract, there was a draft.

37:23.980 --> 37:30.148
You would've gotten a number, and then...
all you could do is just wait.

37:32.089 --> 37:39.789
And everybody knew somebody that was going
over, or somebody who was not coming back.

37:39.790 --> 37:42.432
- You never get over that.
- Apparently not.

37:45.011 --> 37:46.929
It sounds to me like justification,

37:47.932 --> 37:49.697
I find it hard to believe
that the only option

37:49.710 --> 37:51.485
available to you at the
time was violence.

37:51.500 --> 37:54.812
Well, we thought that sitting at
home while your government committed

37:54.825 --> 37:58.146
genocide and doing nothing about
it, that that was violence.

38:04.062 --> 38:06.459
What about you?

38:08.751 --> 38:10.889
What are you willing to take a risk for?

38:13.327 --> 38:15.594
I don't know. I know that I
wouldn't blow up a building.

38:15.607 --> 38:17.885
I wouldn't kill
anybody for anything.

38:17.993 --> 38:23.648
Yeah, well... dissent can be dicey.

38:23.968 --> 38:27.711
But you can't get to my age
without some regrets.

38:30.002 --> 38:32.087
Would you do it again?

38:34.898 --> 38:42.898
If... I didn't have kids,
and old parents that I love,

38:45.842 --> 38:48.567
Yeah, I would do it again.

38:50.313 --> 38:54.588
Smarter, better... different.

38:57.505 --> 38:59.589
But I'd do it, yeah.

39:01.464 --> 39:06.610
We made mistakes,
but we were right.

39:07.365 --> 39:12.761
And is Nick Sloan right?

39:14.190 --> 39:17.230
He has a daughter much younger than yours,
that he abandoned in a hotel room.

39:17.315 --> 39:21.482
- People do what they have to do.
- Well, what are you doing then, here

39:21.898 --> 39:24.511
with me? I mean, you...
you had a choice in all this after all.

39:25.011 --> 39:28.083
Well, look at me. It doesn't
matter what I say, unless...

39:28.096 --> 39:31.179
I say it to somebody who's
interested in the truth.

39:32.417 --> 39:39.697
And it seems, as if you're interested
in the truth. Most people aren't.

39:40.841 --> 39:46.155
- What are you gonna do?
- My job.

39:48.551 --> 39:50.322
Good.

39:56.052 --> 40:02.015
And what do you think Jim... Nick...
what do you think he's doing now?

40:05.532 --> 40:09.491
Maybe you should figure that out.

40:12.303 --> 40:16.707
Look, if my coming here in
any way was responsible for...

40:17.108 --> 40:21.823
him being found out, well that
was not my intention, and he knows that.

40:22.525 --> 40:27.238
We never betrayed each other,
not once, any of us, over all these years,

40:30.126 --> 40:32.530
and I'm not about to start now.

40:33.879 --> 40:35.572
What about Mimi Lurie?

40:36.281 --> 40:38.331
Is she out there living a
good, clean, productive life?

40:38.344 --> 40:40.405
Anything's possible.

40:42.006 --> 40:43.818
Mimi and Nick...

40:46.156 --> 40:47.448
were different.

40:48.557 --> 40:51.294
Radicals? Yes. But also lovers.

40:51.628 --> 40:56.161
- Did you...
- Time's up, sir.

41:00.970 --> 41:06.387
- Thank you for talking to me.
- Thank you for listening.

41:20.343 --> 41:23.363
They did unforgivable things,
but you gotta appreciate the commitment.

41:23.464 --> 41:25.847
No, you don't. Appreciate
the fact that the

41:25.860 --> 41:28.255
bank guard they murdered
had two small kids.

41:28.456 --> 41:30.577
It's just hard to reconcile
the woman with her past.

41:30.677 --> 41:32.642
Sir, don't allow yourself
to get spun by these people.

41:32.655 --> 41:34.630
I don't "get spun."

41:34.730 --> 41:37.130
Well, you've been pretty soft on her
from the very beginning.

41:37.415 --> 41:39.627
We're the good guys here,
but you seem not to care.

41:39.827 --> 41:43.469
You write an article that blasts my team
publicly for doing our jobs well,

41:43.670 --> 41:45.024
and you make light of decent...

41:45.037 --> 41:46.402
No. No, I didn't blast anybody. She
was turning herself in, that's her...

41:46.403 --> 41:49.923
No! There was no deal. We had intel,
we tracked her, we made the arrest. Now...

41:50.024 --> 41:53.158
Where's that article? We took a
thirty-year fugitive off the street,

41:53.168 --> 41:54.925
and would have gotten her
partner if it hadn't

41:54.938 --> 41:56.706
been for some two-bit
journalist interfering...

41:56.757 --> 41:58.797
Would you even know who he was,
if it wasn't for me?

42:00.217 --> 42:03.363
Well, you do seem awfully
tied in to these people,

42:03.963 --> 42:07.832
Solarz only talks to you, you meet with
Sloan two days before he disappears,

42:07.833 --> 42:10.251
Givin' him a big head-start, if not more...

42:10.750 --> 42:13.800
Perhaps you're a little more interesting
than I initially thought?

42:14.700 --> 42:18.563
We're bringing these people down,
and I hope I don't find you in my way.

42:18.663 --> 42:22.435
Agent, I need you to
report to an OPR review.

42:24.710 --> 42:26.687
Don't ever ask me for anything again.

42:26.688 --> 42:28.457
What are you talking about?
I thought we were bonding?

42:28.470 --> 42:30.248
I feel like I just watched
you get hypnotised in there...

42:30.349 --> 42:32.364
"I was just young, female,
and opposing injustice"?

42:32.377 --> 42:34.402
That's her justification?
That was offensive!

42:34.403 --> 42:35.991
I'm not arguing that point...

42:36.595 --> 42:38.569
Where are you guys on the Sloan thing?
You think you're gonna find him?

42:38.669 --> 42:41.904
I think he knows how to run,
which means he has an advantage.

42:42.004 --> 42:46.408
Terrorists justify terrorism, Ben.
Don't get confused here.

43:27.229 --> 43:30.258
Don't tell me you have to go
when you don't have to go!

44:08.470 --> 44:10.903
- Hello?
- This is Ben Shepherd, Albany Sun-Times.

44:12.066 --> 44:13.416
Yes?

44:13.616 --> 44:17.466
Dr. Sloan, I've spoken directly to your
brother. I've spoken to Sharon Solarz...

44:18.366 --> 44:20.074
- Yes?
- I have something to tell you, sir...

44:20.075 --> 44:23.175
- it's important that we speak.
- Go ahead... be quick.

44:23.275 --> 44:25.197
Two minutes, but not over the phone.
I don't trust phones...

44:25.210 --> 44:27.142
yours or mine, for that matter.

44:28.670 --> 44:33.592
- You get here before ten.
- Perfect! Thank you, sir.

44:35.034 --> 44:37.676
Yes, we are currently
outside the home of.

44:37.689 --> 44:40.343
Dr. Daniel Sloan, brother
of fugitive Nick Sloan.

44:40.444 --> 44:42.582
We have no new information
to report at this time,

44:42.595 --> 44:44.744
but we are continuing to
monitor the situation...

44:44.839 --> 44:46.097
- Ben Shepherd.
- Yeah?

44:46.198 --> 44:47.355
- Albany Sun-Times.
- Yeah...

44:47.756 --> 44:50.772
- Maulik Banjali of Reuters...
- Hey! What's goin' on?

44:50.773 --> 44:52.128
No interviews.

44:52.350 --> 44:54.129
- No interviews?
- Yeah.

44:56.786 --> 44:59.419
Hi... Ben Shepard, Albany Sun-Times,

44:59.519 --> 45:03.116
- Dr. Sloan's expecting to see me?
- Yes, he is, sir. You can go right up.

45:03.117 --> 45:04.117
Thank you.

45:11.808 --> 45:14.717
- Dr. Sloan, Ben Shepard. I'm sorry I'm late.
- Yeah...

45:15.318 --> 45:16.517
Thank you.

45:20.021 --> 45:21.608
Beautiful...

45:23.363 --> 45:25.685
So... tell me what you need to tell me.

45:26.484 --> 45:30.018
We sh... Okay...

45:31.419 --> 45:33.919
Well, your brother obviously
counted on you a great deal...

45:34.719 --> 45:37.690
- Were you two close growing up?
- He was my older brother,

45:38.790 --> 45:43.002
I looked up to him. I was a kid,
I didn't understand what he was doing.

45:45.003 --> 45:47.360
You said you had
something to tell me.

45:47.373 --> 45:49.740
I'm just trying to figure
out why you're helping him?

45:49.841 --> 45:53.597
Well, I'm helping my niece,
she's innocent in all this.

45:53.999 --> 45:55.560
And your brother?

45:55.561 --> 45:58.300
They blew up buildings.
It's been well-documented.

45:58.400 --> 46:00.921
- Do you approve of that?
- Of course not.

46:02.233 --> 46:04.153
Now, if you have nothing
more to ask, I think that...

46:04.166 --> 46:06.096
Do you think he's coming
back for his daughter?

46:06.396 --> 46:08.582
- Is that what he's doing?
- Excuse me?

46:08.684 --> 46:10.861
I'm trying to understand
his thinking process.

46:10.874 --> 46:13.062
I mean, why not take
his daughter with him?

46:13.064 --> 46:14.665
You know, why not change
his name and disappear?

46:14.678 --> 46:16.291
He obviously knows
how to do that.

46:16.292 --> 46:20.251
You said you had something to tell me.
Obviously, that's not the case.

46:20.252 --> 46:23.740
So, I think we're done here.
We didn't ask for this.

46:25.240 --> 46:26.830
I don't condone what he did...

46:26.931 --> 46:30.576
and I certainly don't appreciate you
manipulating your way into my house.

46:30.577 --> 46:33.115
- You need to leave.
- Are you enrolling her in school?

46:35.245 --> 46:38.594
'Cause I tell you, this situation doesn't
look like a permanent situation to me,

46:38.595 --> 46:39.995
and I'm guessing not to you either.

46:41.295 --> 46:42.779
So, what is he doin'?

46:44.380 --> 46:47.280
- Buying himself time for something.
- I dunno, for what?

46:49.104 --> 46:51.021
I don't know, I'm asking you.

46:52.025 --> 46:56.784
Your brother's nothing if he's not logical.
And right now, nothing he's doing...

46:58.588 --> 47:01.318
makes any sense if he's guilty.

47:41.592 --> 47:43.491
Help yourself...

47:50.259 --> 47:56.260
You know... you should...
Holy shit!

48:00.056 --> 48:02.468
It's right over here, lumber yard.

48:09.322 --> 48:11.827
Don't worry, nobody's watching.

48:11.928 --> 48:14.741
They're on Daniel.
They'll get to you, soon enough.

48:14.742 --> 48:18.620
Yeah, well... anyone works for me
is an ex-con anyway.

48:19.428 --> 48:22.133
- Boy, this is some operation you got here.
- Yeah...

48:22.245 --> 48:26.967
Yeah... ya' got redwood, ya' got
pine, and cedar in there...

48:27.867 --> 48:32.469
- Western Red Cedar... you can smell it.
- It's a fire meth and certified.

48:32.470 --> 48:35.374
Yeah, I can see you're still into
herbal teas and soy products.

48:35.375 --> 48:40.276
Yeah, well, you know... I quit drinkin'
and smokin', and I gained weight, and I...

48:40.776 --> 48:45.784
Shit man, why am I tellin' you this?
I don't belong to the collective anymore.

48:45.885 --> 48:50.489
- I don't answer to you!
- I need a place to stay the night,

48:50.490 --> 48:53.181
and a couple of questions answered, Donal.

48:57.347 --> 49:00.474
Okay, crash at my place.

49:02.974 --> 49:05.369
Hey, it's this... This truck.

49:09.954 --> 49:12.040
That guy looks a little bit like Rick!
Remember him?

49:12.053 --> 49:14.149
The roadie from Monterrey?

49:14.650 --> 49:18.192
That IS Rick, the roadie from Monterrey.

49:19.225 --> 49:25.609
- Jesus... I thought he'd died.
- We all died, some of us came back.

49:33.081 --> 49:35.960
- Keep in touch with anybody else?
- A few...

49:36.061 --> 49:40.061
Steve and Penny, Carol...
they're in New York, and...

49:40.160 --> 49:43.489
now, who else? Let's see...
I'd go visit Noah, you know?

49:43.590 --> 49:45.790
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah, he's in Lompoc, y' know.

49:45.791 --> 49:48.686
I see him couple times a year, and...

49:49.214 --> 49:53.603
- Little Sweeney and Laura Horse...
- Do you know where she is, Donal?

49:55.741 --> 49:56.918
Nah, man, I don't.

49:56.919 --> 49:58.846
After the bank, Sharon
came to you for help.

49:58.859 --> 50:00.796
Really? How do you know that?

50:00.896 --> 50:03.856
Because of the name she lived under
before she married her current husband.

50:04.750 --> 50:06.834
It was in the papers
when she was arrested,

50:06.838 --> 50:10.705
Coyle. And that was you
when you went under in '72.

50:11.521 --> 50:15.587
I figured you got married and...
gave her a new identity, and then

50:15.588 --> 50:17.848
she went somewhere else,
and then after a couple

50:17.861 --> 50:20.131
of years you gave an
uncontested divorce,

50:20.231 --> 50:21.231
and left her with a name.

50:22.031 --> 50:24.697
Right? Am I right?

50:25.106 --> 50:28.644
- Did Mimi come to you, too?
- Well now, why would Mimi come to me?

50:28.861 --> 50:34.135
You know, I'm... Shit, man, this is a
real shit-kicker of a questionin'...

50:34.335 --> 50:38.074
and to show up and ask
me to trust you with

50:38.087 --> 50:41.836
information that makes me
an accessory to murder?

50:41.837 --> 50:46.227
Neither of them had any fuckin' right to
ask me a thing... and neither do you.

50:46.629 --> 50:48.913
I mean, I was a-wind of
you guys for the B and.

50:48.926 --> 50:51.219
M, and I wasn't even
on a damn committee!

50:51.320 --> 50:54.236
- I was the fuck out of it, and...
- Did she come to you, or not?

50:54.337 --> 50:56.618
- Alright... alright...
- Just tell me, for christ's sake.

50:56.717 --> 50:59.801
You know better than anyone...
Mimi was not

50:59.814 --> 51:02.908
going to be some kind
of suburban housewife,

51:03.009 --> 51:06.108
drive a min-van
and go to the PTA!

51:06.109 --> 51:08.826
She was gonna live or
die a freedom fighter!

51:08.927 --> 51:12.369
Married to the movement.
Y'know, the last I

51:12.382 --> 51:15.835
heard about her, she was
on her way to Cuba.

51:22.669 --> 51:25.920
Ten houses down, the one
with the green windows...

51:25.933 --> 51:29.194
but go around to the
side, to the kitchen.

51:34.228 --> 51:35.920
And what about you?

51:36.920 --> 51:39.792
Why didn't you come to
me for help, back then?

51:40.800 --> 51:46.009
- I didn't wanna go too far.
- Too far? What, you stayed?

51:46.530 --> 51:50.435
Yeah, for a while. I thought
she might come back.

51:50.448 --> 51:54.363
Who? Lurie? Come back?

51:54.864 --> 52:00.389
Come on, get real, man! Mimi Lurie
is nothing but a dream you once had.

52:30.488 --> 52:34.140
Afternoon, ma'am. Are you aware
you're inside the shipping lane?

52:34.241 --> 52:37.265
Oh so sorry, Captain, we're
practicing for the Catalina Cup.

52:37.278 --> 52:40.312
But we're too fast to
get in anyone's way...

52:40.513 --> 52:44.568
- Roger that. Just stay east of 122.
- Aye, aye, Captain!

53:25.783 --> 53:26.983
Hi, Teri!

53:30.183 --> 53:32.701
Thank God for government bonds.

53:33.205 --> 53:36.777
My accountant used to laugh
at me for being risk averse.

53:38.206 --> 53:41.133
Don't give me that
"capitalist dog" look.

53:41.435 --> 53:43.539
Goin' legit has its advantages!

53:43.640 --> 53:47.401
Sure! As long as bankrupting people's
pension funds remains legit,

53:47.903 --> 53:52.178
And running good, honest weed remains...
criminal?

53:55.395 --> 53:59.069
You're gonna wanna look at that.
I saved it for ya'.

54:01.337 --> 54:07.020
Sharon Solarz... a housewife in
Vermont, do you believe it? - Shit.

54:07.132 --> 54:09.145
And Billy Cusimano...

54:09.667 --> 54:12.167
- Who?
- From the Brotherhood.

54:12.999 --> 54:15.859
Nice to know ol' Billy's
keeping the flame alive.

54:19.133 --> 54:22.826
And Nick Sloan... a
lawyer from Albany.

54:22.839 --> 54:26.542
Christ, how'd he manage
to pull that one off?

54:26.543 --> 54:28.335
It's what he always wanted.

54:29.756 --> 54:32.498
As I recall, you two were pretty tight.

54:33.951 --> 54:35.739
I don't know, it was a long time ago.

54:35.740 --> 54:41.056
So, why do you think she decided to
turn herself in after all these years?

54:41.985 --> 54:43.674
I don't know, Mac.

54:46.149 --> 54:48.754
- Guess she got tired.
- Yeah.

54:49.691 --> 54:50.604
Times change, babe.

54:53.505 --> 54:55.117
Tabs, maybe.

54:56.892 --> 54:59.432
Mr. McGowan, this is
Ben Shepard calling

54:59.445 --> 55:01.995
again from the Albany
Sun-Times newspaper...

55:02.321 --> 55:04.641
as I said, this is
regarding the research that

55:04.654 --> 55:06.983
we're doing on the Bank
of Michigan robbery...

55:07.083 --> 55:13.005
and I would appreciate a call back,
my number is 518-555-1218.

55:28.120 --> 55:29.620
Hello?

55:54.493 --> 55:55.993
You're not gonna believe
what just happened to me.

55:56.006 --> 55:57.517
FBI was in my apartment.

55:57.618 --> 55:59.325
I don't need this right now.

55:59.338 --> 56:01.055
Look, a search warrant. No probable
cause, that's a story, right?

56:01.156 --> 56:02.346
That's not a story.

56:02.359 --> 56:03.559
They're pissed because I'm doing
their job better than they are.

56:03.660 --> 56:05.135
Well, you know how to
make friends, don't you?

56:05.148 --> 56:06.634
It's not about making friends!
It's about making history!

56:06.735 --> 56:08.329
I'm talkin' about history...

56:10.630 --> 56:12.123
I got your request...

56:12.931 --> 56:14.503
I can't send you to Michigan.

56:14.703 --> 56:16.251
You have to send me to Michigan,
she's being indicted in Michigan.

56:16.264 --> 56:17.822
We'll get it from the wires.

56:17.923 --> 56:19.842
No, wires are shit. This is
big, I'm putting us on the map.

56:19.855 --> 56:21.786
People know my name, Ray. You
have to send me out there!

56:21.787 --> 56:25.748
Hey. Hey! Have some fuckin' awareness.
Okay? This isn't all about you.

56:25.749 --> 56:27.334
I just laid off my sports department.

56:27.335 --> 56:28.965
Well, who gives a shit about
Albany High girls soccer?

56:28.978 --> 56:30.620
I mean, what are we
talking about here...?

56:30.621 --> 56:31.989
- Don't be an asshole.
- I'm not being an asshole.

56:31.990 --> 56:34.151
Why are you acting like we're
not killing it right now?

56:34.396 --> 56:36.266
I'm on the fuckin' 10-yard line!
I'm on the

56:36.279 --> 56:38.159
10-yard line and you're
stopping me right now.

56:38.858 --> 56:40.185
That's a bad article.

56:40.286 --> 56:42.412
It's a bad arti... it's an exclusive with
the guy's brother! It's a bad article...

56:42.413 --> 56:43.869
You took a shot at him,
you made it personal.

56:43.870 --> 56:47.030
- He's a shmuck, Ray!
- I don't fucking care what he is!

56:48.950 --> 56:51.384
That's not what we do!
And this is not the first time!

56:51.585 --> 56:54.226
You don't just destroy someone to see
if you can uncover something!

56:54.377 --> 56:56.888
That's a shitty way to go about things!
Got it?

56:56.889 --> 56:58.874
The fact that we are even having
this conversation is ridiculous.

56:58.875 --> 57:00.374
I gave you an exclusive
with Sharon Solarz, I

57:00.387 --> 57:01.896
gave you an exclusive
with the guy's brother.

57:01.897 --> 57:03.665
Nick Sloan would still be
defending spotted owls if

57:03.678 --> 57:05.456
it wasn't for me. Nobody can
do what I am doing, Ray.

57:05.557 --> 57:08.445
- Alan Springer, returning.
- I gotta call him back.

57:08.553 --> 57:10.524
I'm in this in a big way,
I need support now, Ray.

57:10.537 --> 57:12.519
I need you to support me.

57:12.720 --> 57:16.936
And you need to stop provoking people.
Especially the FBI! Okay?

57:17.138 --> 57:18.438
Okay.

57:21.054 --> 57:22.746
I got bosses too, you know.

57:31.563 --> 57:32.842
So, what are you thinkin'?

57:33.047 --> 57:34.635
You know, I'm still
wrapping my head around it.

57:34.636 --> 57:37.317
These people are... they're all nuts,
but none of 'em are illogical.

57:38.859 --> 57:41.846
You know, if this man is trying to escape,
if he was trying to disappear,

57:41.847 --> 57:43.148
he'd have taken his daughter with him.

57:43.348 --> 57:45.569
- Maybe.
- But he didn't.

57:46.069 --> 57:49.101
Instead, he conducts a very risky and
complicated series of switches,

57:49.402 --> 57:52.764
gets his daughter in safekeeping,
gets to New York. By himself, alone.

57:53.877 --> 57:55.641
Which changes everything, right?
I mean, if the guy

57:55.654 --> 57:57.427
is innocent, and he's running
because he's innocent,

57:57.528 --> 57:59.516
why doesn't Sharon just clear him?

57:59.716 --> 58:02.731
Because she's in custody and she was his
partner, and that doesn't hold up in court.

58:02.832 --> 58:06.161
Yeah, but why, why, why, why hide for
thirty years if you're innocent, y' know?

58:06.162 --> 58:07.727
Innocence only gets you so far.

58:07.828 --> 58:09.511
Michigan number.
This is where it all started!

58:09.512 --> 58:12.438
- 'Cause you're not going to Michigan.
- Ben Shepherd.

58:13.038 --> 58:16.770
Mr. McGowan!
Thank you for calling me b...

58:19.397 --> 58:22.668
Yes. I'm sorry for your loss.

58:24.235 --> 58:26.506
Okay. Bye bye.

58:26.507 --> 58:27.507
Fuck!

59:19.807 --> 59:22.408
Donal? Donal!

59:43.295 --> 59:45.794
Hey! Hey! Hey!

59:46.996 --> 59:48.292
What are you doing, man?

59:50.338 --> 59:51.569
What are YOU doing?

59:51.669 --> 59:54.800
- I went to get you a car.
- Shit.

59:55.217 --> 01:00:01.051
What? You thought I ran out on ya'?

01:00:01.589 --> 01:00:07.526
I thought, maybe you realized what a risk
you were taking, for a guy you hardly know.

01:00:07.626 --> 01:00:13.369
Hey, do you remember? We used to be
best of friends. You remember that?

01:00:17.714 --> 01:00:19.150
Yep.

01:00:19.750 --> 01:00:23.585
Here's the key. It's clean.
It'll get you out of town, at least.

01:00:30.545 --> 01:00:34.916
Call the cops in the morning. Tell 'em I
came to see you asking for help,

01:00:34.917 --> 01:00:39.492
and you refused 'cause you're
an upstanding, law-abiding citizen.

01:00:40.017 --> 01:00:44.712
Jeez...
Alright, now listen to me...

01:00:44.917 --> 01:00:49.842
Mimi did come to me,
I put her in touch with Jed Lewis.

01:00:50.143 --> 01:00:54.716
He made some introductions.
Political friends... in Havana.

01:00:54.717 --> 01:00:55.773
- Jed Louis!
- Yeah.

01:00:55.873 --> 01:00:59.234
I thought Jed was above ground.
How can he ge...

01:00:59.247 --> 01:01:02.618
No! No, no, no. He's got the
list, so he can find her.

01:01:03.273 --> 01:01:06.890
Alright. Fuckin' run, man.

01:01:25.963 --> 01:01:30.483
A security guard is dead after a robbery
turned violent in Briarwood Mall.

01:01:30.683 --> 01:01:34.725
At five minutes after 8 a.m.
a man and a women, masked and armed,

01:01:34.826 --> 01:01:37.537
entered the local branch
of the Bank of Michigan.

01:01:37.638 --> 01:01:39.826
An exchange of gunfire
occurred between the

01:01:39.839 --> 01:01:42.038
suspects and bank security
guard Hugh Kroessna,

01:01:42.039 --> 01:01:46.020
pronounced dead at the scene. According
to investigating officer Henry Osborne,

01:01:46.121 --> 01:01:49.102
the investigation
is considered active and ongoing.

01:01:54.510 --> 01:01:58.377
- Osborne...
- Hello.

01:01:58.478 --> 01:02:02.127
Hi! My name's Ben Shepard. I'm calling
from the Albany Sun Times newspaper.

01:02:02.328 --> 01:02:05.153
- Albany, New York.
- I should hope so.

01:02:07.312 --> 01:02:11.395
I left a couple messages... I'm trying
to locate police chief Henry Osborne?

01:02:11.396 --> 01:02:12.761
Former police chief.

01:02:12.762 --> 01:02:14.562
Yeah... well, I just wanted
to ask him a couple of

01:02:14.575 --> 01:02:16.615
questions regarding the
recent Sharon Solarz arrest?

01:02:16.688 --> 01:02:18.720
- He is still...?
- Alive?

01:02:19.921 --> 01:02:21.087
Well, yeah.

01:02:21.088 --> 01:02:23.928
Well, he'd better be, or I'm on my way
to the yacht club to see a ghost!

01:02:27.642 --> 01:02:30.155
See, I'm here in Detroit
doing some research, and...

01:02:30.256 --> 01:02:32.073
from my understanding his
department was pretty

01:02:32.086 --> 01:02:33.913
involved in the Bank of
Michigan investigation,

01:02:33.914 --> 01:02:36.002
I just wanted to ask him a
couple of questions about that.

01:02:36.102 --> 01:02:37.496
But he's not here right now.

01:02:37.509 --> 01:02:38.914
Well, I'm just doin'
a little background...

01:02:39.015 --> 01:02:40.798
But he's still not here.

01:02:41.702 --> 01:02:43.158
Well, how about this? Can
I give you my number,

01:02:43.171 --> 01:02:44.651
and then maybe you
can pass it to him?

01:02:44.736 --> 01:02:46.440
I'd really appreciate
it, I'm quite harmless.

01:02:46.453 --> 01:02:48.169
Really?

01:02:48.170 --> 01:02:53.369
The number is 518-555-1218.

01:02:53.370 --> 01:02:55.048
That's my office and I'm
calling you from my cell.

01:02:55.061 --> 01:02:56.750
Thanks for your time.

01:02:58.275 --> 01:03:01.515
The manhunt for Nicholas Sloan continues
at this time in Milwaukee

01:03:01.617 --> 01:03:03.757
where former Weather
Underground member Donald

01:03:03.770 --> 01:03:05.920
Fitzgerald was taken
into custody today.

01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:10.367
Federal authorities suspect Mr. Fitzgerald
of aiding and abetting Nicholas Sloan

01:03:10.466 --> 01:03:13.384
who continues to elude
Federal investigators.

01:03:13.788 --> 01:03:17.763
Nick went to Donal,
he's trying to find me.

01:03:17.864 --> 01:03:21.172
You're safe here, you can lie low.

01:03:23.268 --> 01:03:24.673
You know I counted last night,

01:03:25.977 --> 01:03:29.236
I've walked out on six lives...

01:03:30.044 --> 01:03:35.878
Six sets of friends... six lovers...
six homes, six names...

01:03:36.278 --> 01:03:38.061
not including my own.

01:03:38.170 --> 01:03:40.587
So, you moving on again?

01:03:41.295 --> 01:03:46.633
- You wanna take the boat?
- No, I'm going inland.

01:03:46.775 --> 01:03:52.033
- Well, door's always open.
- Thanks, Mac.

01:03:57.759 --> 01:04:00.996
You submit one goddamn receipt from
this trip, and you're fired on the spot.

01:04:01.297 --> 01:04:03.275
Yeah, right, like you
haven't said that before.

01:04:03.276 --> 01:04:05.396
Don't fuck with me, Ben.
I'm not in the mood.

01:04:07.014 --> 01:04:09.663
- So, are you in Milwaukee?
- No, I'm in Michigan.

01:04:10.564 --> 01:04:13.801
- Your guy was spotted in Milwaukee.
- I know that, I saw it on the news.

01:04:14.102 --> 01:04:16.186
And here I thought
we were the news.

01:04:16.199 --> 01:04:18.293
Look, I'm workin' on it, Ray, alright?
I'm bustin' my ass.

01:04:18.393 --> 01:04:21.268
Good. You got 24 hours to get me something
and you can keep your job.

01:04:21.368 --> 01:04:23.067
No shit. My job that doesn't pay?

01:04:23.068 --> 01:04:24.425
Yeah, that one! And
you're lucky to have it.

01:04:24.438 --> 01:04:25.807
Okay.

01:04:32.129 --> 01:04:36.858
Mr. Osborne?
Ben Shepard, Albany Sun-Times.

01:04:39.529 --> 01:04:41.825
You're a long way from
Albany, Mr. Shepard.

01:04:41.838 --> 01:04:44.145
Well, phones don't work
so well out there...

01:04:44.746 --> 01:04:47.796
- You're a hard man to pin down.
- Apparently not.

01:04:48.396 --> 01:04:51.307
Do you mind? There are proper channels,
what with my friends and family here.

01:04:51.308 --> 01:04:52.889
I'm sorry, I know it's an intrusion,

01:04:52.989 --> 01:04:55.297
I just didn't want to disturb you at home.

01:04:57.235 --> 01:04:59.573
- What?
- Can I speak to you, please sir?

01:05:01.939 --> 01:05:04.531
- Excuse me...
- Thank you.

01:05:10.253 --> 01:05:12.553
Now, what is it you're here for?

01:05:12.970 --> 01:05:15.054
Well, sir, I was just hoping
I could ask you a couple of

01:05:15.067 --> 01:05:17.228
questions regarding the Bank
of Michigan investigation.

01:05:17.962 --> 01:05:19.953
- That was a long time ago.
- But you watch the news,

01:05:19.954 --> 01:05:21.542
I'm sure you're aware
Sharon Solarz has been

01:05:21.555 --> 01:05:23.154
brought back to Michigan
to stand trial.

01:05:23.654 --> 01:05:25.682
Nick Sloan has been
identified and is on the run.

01:05:25.683 --> 01:05:27.049
I am aware.

01:05:27.050 --> 01:05:30.084
How involved was your department
with the Bank of Michigan investigation?

01:05:31.004 --> 01:05:32.788
Well, this is all in the public record.

01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:35.176
What about before that?

01:05:35.684 --> 01:05:37.448
My understanding is, you
covered the campus.

01:05:37.461 --> 01:05:39.237
Y' know, pretty active, right?

01:05:39.538 --> 01:05:42.858
You ever come in contact with Mimi Lurie
or Nick Sloan before they went underground?

01:05:42.864 --> 01:05:46.021
No. I-I'm sorry, what is it you're
trying to get answered?

01:05:46.122 --> 01:05:48.631
You know, maybe if I knew
the question I could better help.

01:05:48.639 --> 01:05:51.556
Well, I'm... I'm just trying to
understand the evidence of the case.

01:05:52.556 --> 01:05:54.026
Sharon Solarz was a teller,

01:05:54.127 --> 01:05:56.808
she went through the training program,
it's pretty self-explanatory.

01:05:56.836 --> 01:05:59.037
But when you get to the others,
that's where I get lost.

01:05:59.128 --> 01:06:01.106
Mimi Lurie, Nick Sloan,
Vince Dallesandro,

01:06:01.119 --> 01:06:03.107
that's where it starts
getting blurry for me.

01:06:04.016 --> 01:06:07.351
Does it? Dallesandro's
prints were on the gun,

01:06:07.453 --> 01:06:10.073
he got caught a couple of days later
on an anonymous tip.

01:06:10.373 --> 01:06:13.298
He testified against the others.
He was already on parole.

01:06:13.299 --> 01:06:15.188
He ended up dying in prison,
or him getting killed,

01:06:15.201 --> 01:06:17.099
killing himself, depending
on who's report you believe.

01:06:17.100 --> 01:06:19.012
Others were all fugitives at the time,

01:06:19.113 --> 01:06:21.759
I heard they were wanted by the FBI,
already underground,

01:06:22.358 --> 01:06:24.344
they knew how to
disappear and they did.

01:06:24.357 --> 01:06:26.998
Yeah, it's just this time I think
he's doing something different.

01:06:27.455 --> 01:06:29.415
Why should this time be any
different than before?

01:06:30.059 --> 01:06:32.711
Well, this time I don't
think he's running away.

01:06:32.724 --> 01:06:35.387
This time, I think he's
trying to clear his name.

01:06:37.589 --> 01:06:40.669
- How do you think he's gonna do that?
- I was hoping you could help me there.

01:06:40.702 --> 01:06:42.276
Not sure how.

01:06:43.494 --> 01:06:46.031
The getaway car was his car,
his prints were all over it.

01:06:46.632 --> 01:06:49.970
- There was testimony that he was there...
- So...?

01:06:50.182 --> 01:06:52.857
What am I missing?

01:06:53.285 --> 01:06:58.094
- Hi, Dad!
- Hey! Alright, sweetie.

01:06:58.395 --> 01:06:59.961
How are ya'?

01:06:59.974 --> 01:07:01.974
How ya' doin'? I'm Ben
Shepard, Albany Sun-Times.

01:07:02.150 --> 01:07:04.129
My wife, Marianne,
and my daughter, Rebecca.

01:07:04.228 --> 01:07:05.949
Albany Sun-Times in
Albany, New York?

01:07:05.962 --> 01:07:07.692
Are you just passing
through, Mr. Shepard?

01:07:07.792 --> 01:07:09.497
He's just leaving.

01:07:11.798 --> 01:07:13.197
I'll be right there.

01:07:13.601 --> 01:07:19.025
So, I'm gonna be headed to...
Ann Arbor for a couple of days

01:07:19.126 --> 01:07:22.046
and I was just wondering if maybe we
could sit down for another 5 minutes?

01:07:22.768 --> 01:07:25.321
Alright, I'll be headed back to town
in a couple of days myself,

01:07:26.322 --> 01:07:30.477
- guess you got my number.
- Perfect. Thank you, sir.

01:07:49.983 --> 01:07:52.675
- Yeah, hello.
- How is she?

01:07:53.412 --> 01:07:55.517
She's safe, she's right here.

01:07:56.117 --> 01:07:58.459
Listen, Eva is afraid the
apartment's under surveillance.

01:07:58.472 --> 01:08:00.826
I'm sure it is.

01:08:02.055 --> 01:08:06.017
We snuck out the service entrance
and came to the park,

01:08:06.117 --> 01:08:08.343
and I can't guarantee we weren't followed.

01:08:10.076 --> 01:08:15.406
- Can I speak to her?
- Hold on, hold on... Izzy!

01:08:22.465 --> 01:08:24.127
Where are you?

01:08:24.140 --> 01:08:25.982
Honey, you don't need
to know that right now.

01:08:27.028 --> 01:08:29.036
But why can't you just tell me?

01:08:30.069 --> 01:08:33.096
Izzy, all I wanna know is...
are you okay?

01:08:33.499 --> 01:08:35.495
Everyone is so mad at you.

01:08:35.599 --> 01:08:38.607
- How 'bout you? You mad at me?
- Where are you?

01:08:38.908 --> 01:08:41.341
I'm trying to get back
to you as soon as I can.

01:08:41.841 --> 01:08:44.175
Got 'im! Just off I-94
near Gurnee, Illinois.

01:08:44.188 --> 01:08:46.533
Send the coordinates
to the field.

01:08:47.033 --> 01:08:49.154
- I know, and it won't be long.
- Done!

01:08:51.729 --> 01:08:53.009
You have a full green light.

01:08:54.751 --> 01:08:56.843
- Still tracking?
- Yep.

01:08:57.676 --> 01:09:00.701
- He's cooked.
- Okay, send Bravo team down...

01:09:00.801 --> 01:09:02.281
Did you kill that man?

01:09:02.885 --> 01:09:05.481
- Did I...?
- Kill him? That man at the bank.

01:09:05.495 --> 01:09:07.889
- Of course not.
- Then why'd you have to leave?

01:09:08.089 --> 01:09:11.553
Honey, one day soon you're gonna
understand everything, I promise.

01:09:11.752 --> 01:09:16.607
I don't want you to grow up and look back
on what I did and feel bad, ever! Okay?

01:09:17.685 --> 01:09:21.752
But now you're gonna have to help me.
You gotta be strong.

01:09:22.252 --> 01:09:25.279
And then next time, you and I will go
somewhere together.

01:09:26.086 --> 01:09:31.863
- Alright? Anywhere you like.
- Home would be fine.

01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:37.276
Gotta go...

01:09:38.921 --> 01:09:43.309
I love you.
You do know that, right?

01:10:57.437 --> 01:11:02.099
- Hi. Ben Shepard, we met on the stairs?
- Oh right, yeah, I remember.

01:11:04.241 --> 01:11:08.921
- You don't look much like your parents.
- I was adopted... so, no.

01:11:09.879 --> 01:11:11.327
If that was your pick-up
line, it needs work.

01:11:11.340 --> 01:11:12.799
Mind if I sit?

01:11:12.999 --> 01:11:14.471
- I am on a date.
- Oh, you're on a date?

01:11:14.472 --> 01:11:15.772
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

01:11:16.242 --> 01:11:18.958
- Kinda like that thing real people do.
- Yes, that.

01:11:20.597 --> 01:11:22.574
Given your manners, I
am really surprised my

01:11:22.587 --> 01:11:24.575
dad doesn't want to spend
more time with you.

01:11:24.576 --> 01:11:26.667
What? What are you talking about?
Me and your dad are good!

01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:29.160
We're playing poker night, takin'
in the Pistons game tomorrow.

01:11:30.181 --> 01:11:31.585
Fun.

01:11:36.132 --> 01:11:37.415
Can I take you to dinner?

01:11:38.523 --> 01:11:40.627
- Excuse me?
- Right! No...

01:11:40.927 --> 01:11:43.030
you're right, coffee then?
What d'ya think?

01:11:43.332 --> 01:11:46.677
I think that my date is on his way back,
and you should leave.

01:11:46.678 --> 01:11:48.552
Not until we figure this
out, coffee or dinner?

01:11:49.353 --> 01:11:51.362
- Persistent.
- Professional hazard.

01:11:51.670 --> 01:11:53.736
- Coffee or...?
- Coffee, if you leave right now.

01:11:53.737 --> 01:11:55.616
Okay, fine... deal.
Time? Place?

01:11:55.717 --> 01:11:57.534
Café at the Union, 2:30.

01:11:57.547 --> 01:11:59.375
Okay. You know this
guy's not right for you.

01:12:00.500 --> 01:12:01.871
Says you...

01:12:05.092 --> 01:12:09.879
- Who was that?
- A friend of my dad's.

01:12:12.801 --> 01:12:15.210
Chance, someone once said...
don't remember who...

01:12:15.318 --> 01:12:18.955
Chance is a nickname for providence.

01:12:20.385 --> 01:12:24.161
Well, it's another way of saying...
that all history is inevitable.

01:12:24.461 --> 01:12:26.877
Because it goes to the
trouble of happening.

01:12:27.490 --> 01:12:32.298
Another point of view says that history
is independent of individual will,

01:12:32.399 --> 01:12:35.769
determined by social conditions
and relations of production,

01:12:35.869 --> 01:12:37.515
relations of production?
We remember that...

01:12:37.528 --> 01:12:39.183
there he is, Karl Marx.

01:12:40.195 --> 01:12:45.728
Now, these theories propose
a history immune to effort,

01:12:45.829 --> 01:12:48.962
removed from the choices of everyday life.

01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:55.188
But history...
is made by human beings!

01:12:55.613 --> 01:13:02.806
And action... and passion...
no less than fate, or economics,

01:13:02.905 --> 01:13:04.789
are it's essential ingredients.

01:13:04.901 --> 01:13:09.265
Go! Go, go go...
But come back tomorrow!

01:13:09.880 --> 01:13:12.294
Because we'll be discussing Fanon.

01:13:23.745 --> 01:13:26.062
- Enjoyed your lecture.
- Thank you.

01:13:26.865 --> 01:13:30.512
"Action and passion" sounds like
something a friend of mine used to say.

01:13:33.204 --> 01:13:35.404
No... No, no, no, no...

01:13:35.408 --> 01:13:37.937
- Need to talk to you, Big Jake.
- Go to hell.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:43.129
- How dare you show up here!
- Where else could I go?

01:13:43.230 --> 01:13:46.984
- You're takin' a hell of a chance.
- Not by choice.

01:13:47.084 --> 01:13:50.946
They're probably watching me.
Unlike you, they know who I am.

01:13:51.668 --> 01:13:54.172
- How's that workin' out, by the way?
- Fuck you...

01:13:54.273 --> 01:13:55.744
I have a life.

01:13:56.863 --> 01:14:00.623
I was hoping for a little bit more,
"Hey, Nick, old friend! How are ya'?"

01:14:00.723 --> 01:14:04.378
- "How ya' been these past thirty-odd years?"
- For christ's sake, Nick...

01:14:04.578 --> 01:14:07.606
I'm a public figure, do you know
the position you're putting me in here?

01:14:07.806 --> 01:14:10.727
Nancy would forgive me banging a
Freshman sooner than talking to you.

01:14:10.827 --> 01:14:14.061
- You're still with Nan?
- Yeah, some of us made it work.

01:14:14.162 --> 01:14:15.857
Yeah, some of you got lucky.

01:14:16.662 --> 01:14:18.882
- It wasn't luck.
- Well, what was then?

01:14:19.483 --> 01:14:22.737
Jed... what was it?

01:14:24.054 --> 01:14:25.946
We didn't kill anybody.

01:14:27.175 --> 01:14:29.089
Jed, I need to find Mimi.

01:14:29.102 --> 01:14:31.582
Looking for a girl? They got
websites for that sort of thing.

01:14:31.771 --> 01:14:33.888
What makes you think I know where she is?

01:14:36.551 --> 01:14:39.846
Donal told you... fuck!

01:14:40.648 --> 01:14:41.847
Fuck!

01:14:41.947 --> 01:14:43.230
Does it matter?

01:14:43.631 --> 01:14:45.214
Jed, does it matter?

01:14:46.439 --> 01:14:50.835
Look, the truth? I haven't talked to Mimi
since bell-bottoms went out of style, okay?

01:14:51.452 --> 01:14:52.813
I mean, how do you know
she's even still alive?

01:14:52.826 --> 01:14:54.199
I don't.

01:14:54.798 --> 01:14:57.502
Why would I help you after all these years?
We didn't even agree back then.

01:14:57.603 --> 01:15:00.731
Because Mimi's the only person
who can help me get my daughter back.

01:15:01.557 --> 01:15:04.274
- You got a daughter?
- Yes.

01:15:07.187 --> 01:15:08.579
No shit?

01:15:41.565 --> 01:15:43.136
Mimi Lurie...

01:15:47.091 --> 01:15:50.195
and Henry Osborne.

01:15:58.950 --> 01:16:00.728
It doesn't make sense.

01:16:18.231 --> 01:16:20.638
Where are you going?

01:16:31.886 --> 01:16:33.915
Let's go. You can
walk me to class.

01:16:34.116 --> 01:16:35.416
Yeah?

01:16:37.082 --> 01:16:39.744
- So, tell me about yourself.
- Peace Corp for a bit,

01:16:41.669 --> 01:16:43.466
thought I was gonna change the world,

01:16:44.066 --> 01:16:47.021
decided it was actually people
who needed changing,

01:16:47.821 --> 01:16:50.016
went back to school to
study psychology, turns

01:16:50.029 --> 01:16:52.234
out psychology has
nothing to do with that,

01:16:53.846 --> 01:16:56.192
ended up in New York, for a bit...

01:16:57.297 --> 01:16:59.312
I guess I thought I was
gonna change myself,

01:17:00.113 --> 01:17:02.217
turns out I'm too stubborn.

01:17:02.418 --> 01:17:04.122
You must be older than I thought.

01:17:06.877 --> 01:17:09.726
So, what happens now?
If in doubt, you go back to law school?

01:17:10.848 --> 01:17:14.617
I'm not in doubt.
It's my mom, she's a judge.

01:17:15.219 --> 01:17:20.449
Really? So was mine!
Just not professionally.

01:17:26.374 --> 01:17:27.849
You like Michigan?

01:17:29.078 --> 01:17:30.548
I love it.

01:17:31.891 --> 01:17:33.453
Okay, you...

01:17:33.653 --> 01:17:35.367
I read one of your articles
online last night.

01:17:35.380 --> 01:17:37.103
I read a couple of
them, actually.

01:17:37.204 --> 01:17:39.645
You're kidding me? Really?
And what'd you think?

01:17:41.467 --> 01:17:43.901
- I think you broke a big story.
- I did!

01:17:45.109 --> 01:17:46.950
I think you're clinging
to it like a life-raft.

01:17:48.422 --> 01:17:50.133
And now it defines you.

01:17:50.234 --> 01:17:53.176
- Yeah, I do.
- Maybe psych's not a bad fit after all.

01:17:55.014 --> 01:17:57.218
I kinda call 'em like I see 'em.

01:17:57.518 --> 01:18:00.152
Fair enough, call this one.
Your father's ignoring me, why?

01:18:01.465 --> 01:18:03.911
I'm guessing because... he
doesn't want to talk to you?

01:18:05.610 --> 01:18:08.786
He's retired.

01:18:10.219 --> 01:18:15.970
I mean, and this was decades ago. He wants
to fish, and watch boats on the water...

01:18:17.103 --> 01:18:20.758
He's also not one for reminiscing.

01:18:22.104 --> 01:18:24.417
You know he was close to the Lurie family?

01:18:25.636 --> 01:18:32.092
Yeah. Her dad and my granddad
were fishing buddies, I think.

01:18:33.246 --> 01:18:35.470
Yeah, so I heard.

01:18:35.482 --> 01:18:37.763
Yeah, they used to go up to
the Linder Woods in the U.P.

01:18:37.818 --> 01:18:40.859
It's absolutely gorgeous
up there, you would hate it.

01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:43.677
- The "U.P."?
- The upper peninsula.

01:18:45.022 --> 01:18:46.848
He told me he never met her.

01:18:53.044 --> 01:18:56.993
Had to be hard, live with the Lurie name
after everything went down.

01:18:56.994 --> 01:18:59.602
Yeah. I'm sure it was.

01:19:00.436 --> 01:19:02.249
You ever talk about her
when you were younger?

01:19:03.353 --> 01:19:05.565
This was all way before my time.

01:19:13.254 --> 01:19:14.733
What are you thinking?

01:19:18.363 --> 01:19:21.288
- Can I speak honestly with you for a second?
- Yeah.

01:19:22.934 --> 01:19:24.430
People lie for two reasons.

01:19:24.830 --> 01:19:26.693
They speak unknowingly, a
simple mistake, y' know.

01:19:26.706 --> 01:19:28.579
Or they do it intentionally,

01:19:28.780 --> 01:19:30.289
and having met a known
fugitive who's also a

01:19:30.302 --> 01:19:31.821
family friend isn't
something you would forget.

01:19:31.922 --> 01:19:33.588
What are you getting at?

01:19:33.989 --> 01:19:36.939
In my business, when someone lies
intentionally, that's significant.

01:19:38.148 --> 01:19:41.298
It seems your father lied to me, I'm
guessing it's some way to cover himself.

01:19:41.798 --> 01:19:46.814
Look, Ben, I get that you're good
at your job, but so is my dad,

01:19:46.915 --> 01:19:50.761
and I would put the quality of his
character up against anyone in the world.

01:19:50.861 --> 01:19:54.694
So, if you're insinuating that he was
or is somehow involved in something

01:19:54.695 --> 01:19:59.418
that ends up in your paper? I would be damn
sure you know what you're talking about.

01:20:00.021 --> 01:20:02.336
I may be a student of the
law, but that's libel,

01:20:02.436 --> 01:20:04.963
and in my business, that's significant.

01:20:09.813 --> 01:20:11.255
I'd like to see you again!

01:20:17.356 --> 01:20:18.697
Bye.

01:20:32.002 --> 01:20:34.311
Every sixth and seventh number.

01:20:35.232 --> 01:20:37.770
- How do I know who I'm calling?
- You don't.

01:20:39.666 --> 01:20:41.637
- Okay.
- Good luck.

01:21:04.822 --> 01:21:08.706
Hi, this is John Smith,
I'm looking for a plumber.

01:21:10.446 --> 01:21:13.252
- Are you now?
- Yes, I am.

01:21:14.614 --> 01:21:16.998
Been a long time
since I've heard that.

01:21:17.011 --> 01:21:19.404
Is this line clean?

01:21:19.506 --> 01:21:22.878
Babe, they didn't listen to me back then,
and they sure ain't listenin' to me now.

01:21:23.682 --> 01:21:26.082
- Who's calling?
- Nick Sloan.

01:21:27.524 --> 01:21:30.868
Nick Sloan? God, I
just saw you on TV.

01:21:30.881 --> 01:21:34.236
Unless you wanna see yourself
there too, we'd better hurry.

01:21:35.237 --> 01:21:37.449
I need to get to Mimi Lurie.

01:21:38.992 --> 01:21:44.416
- Where are you?
- 845-555-8249.

01:21:46.288 --> 01:21:49.522
Okay, I'll see if we still got the juice.

01:21:50.126 --> 01:21:51.622
Hang tight, brother.

01:22:04.189 --> 01:22:08.901
You wanna hear somethin' funny? I've
been Jim Grant longer than I've been me.

01:22:09.102 --> 01:22:10.473
That's nice.

01:22:12.953 --> 01:22:14.961
Come on, Jed, we're just talking here.

01:22:15.661 --> 01:22:16.841
We don't need to talk.

01:22:18.257 --> 01:22:22.249
- I think we do, you're angry.
- You're damn right I am.

01:22:23.365 --> 01:22:27.136
Jesus. Thirty years on, still
holding a grudge?

01:22:27.336 --> 01:22:28.821
No...

01:22:30.249 --> 01:22:32.554
it was the lack of respect.

01:22:32.859 --> 01:22:36.512
You guys put everybody in danger. We didn't
kill anybody, we didn't hurt anyone.

01:22:36.813 --> 01:22:38.638
We were a peace movement,
for christ's sake!

01:22:40.980 --> 01:22:42.880
People make mistakes, Jed.

01:22:45.168 --> 01:22:48.181
Then you turn yourself in and
atone for what you've done,

01:22:48.280 --> 01:22:51.019
and then you keep up the struggle
in any small way you can.

01:22:52.226 --> 01:22:53.815
You like what you're doing now?

01:22:54.827 --> 01:22:56.311
Yeah.

01:22:57.013 --> 01:23:00.698
Yeah! I like what I try to do...
I like my students.

01:23:01.398 --> 01:23:03.066
Seems like it's mutual.

01:23:03.666 --> 01:23:07.373
Yeah... I can still pack the hall when I...

01:23:09.199 --> 01:23:10.891
talk about SDS.

01:23:12.637 --> 01:23:15.062
March on Washington,
trying to change the world,

01:23:15.162 --> 01:23:17.146
they're drawn to it, I can tell.

01:23:18.162 --> 01:23:19.759
They just don't know
what to do with it.

01:23:20.358 --> 01:23:22.896
I don't know why they would,
it's ancient history to them.

01:23:24.300 --> 01:23:25.480
So they listen and clap,

01:23:25.580 --> 01:23:29.311
and then they update their Facebook
statuses and they forget all about it.

01:23:29.413 --> 01:23:31.539
- We've turned into our parents, Jed.
- Yeah,

01:23:32.851 --> 01:23:35.097
now we're just a story told to children.

01:23:37.192 --> 01:23:40.827
Well, I'm glad someone's still telling it.

01:23:46.702 --> 01:23:49.443
- Yeah.
- You the guy that needs a plumber?

01:23:49.944 --> 01:23:54.731
- I am. Line clean?
- Thirty seconds to be safe.

01:23:54.832 --> 01:23:56.612
- Mimi?
- Was here, yeah.

01:23:56.712 --> 01:23:58.404
- Here?
- Big Sur.

01:23:59.203 --> 01:24:01.408
- Was?
- Left yesterday.

01:24:02.116 --> 01:24:04.125
- Say where going?
- North.

01:24:04.633 --> 01:24:06.609
By boat?

01:24:06.622 --> 01:24:08.742
Woulda' made more sense,
but she was headin' inland.

01:24:09.009 --> 01:24:11.304
- Got it.
- Good luck!

01:24:12.767 --> 01:24:14.397
She gone?

01:24:14.818 --> 01:24:18.401
Yeah...
but I know where she's headed.

01:24:19.947 --> 01:24:22.889
Hey? Thanks for everything.

01:24:23.693 --> 01:24:27.064
You really want to thank me, Nick,
you'll never contact me again.

01:25:03.484 --> 01:25:06.308
Everything we have on the reporter,
he's been in Michigan for two days.

01:25:06.509 --> 01:25:09.224
Background on people he's contacted
and places he's visited.

01:25:09.326 --> 01:25:11.556
- Stay on him.
- Of course, sir. Travel safe.

01:25:28.803 --> 01:25:30.295
Can I see some ID, please?

01:25:31.932 --> 01:25:35.278
Alright, thank you Mr. Haywood.
Have a good day.

01:25:45.162 --> 01:25:47.784
I'm looking for real estate
records and plat maps?

01:25:48.284 --> 01:25:53.313
Lurie family, Linder-Lurie Lumber,
and Linder Holdings... going back 50 years.

01:25:55.893 --> 01:25:57.159
Those three.

01:26:00.889 --> 01:26:02.493
Agent Cornelius, welcome back...

01:26:04.956 --> 01:26:06.431
Right this way.

01:26:17.870 --> 01:26:21.228
- So, where are the Linder Woods?
- I have no idea.

01:26:22.557 --> 01:26:25.469
What about Drummond Island?

01:26:25.482 --> 01:26:28.404
It's up here, right across
the water from Canada.

01:26:28.708 --> 01:26:30.417
And this white part, this
is private property, right?

01:26:30.430 --> 01:26:32.149
Beats me.

01:26:32.250 --> 01:26:34.482
I mean, it's not part of that...
that conservancy,

01:26:34.495 --> 01:26:36.738
or that preserve, or
whatever that is?

01:26:37.166 --> 01:26:43.622
No... it doesn't look like it. I don't
see any sales, or state seizure reports.

01:26:44.543 --> 01:26:47.543
But if this is privatly owned, somebody's
still paying taxes on this, right?

01:26:48.297 --> 01:26:49.772
I don't know.

01:26:50.689 --> 01:26:52.585
- Can I have copies of all this?
- Sure.

01:27:26.074 --> 01:27:28.599
I'm standing outside the
Ann Arbor courthouse where

01:27:28.612 --> 01:27:31.147
Sharon Solarz entered a
plea of "not guilty."

01:27:31.648 --> 01:27:33.368
Judge Panomino remanded her without bail...

01:27:33.580 --> 01:27:35.500
- Mr. Osbourne, can I speak to you?
- Not now.

01:27:35.601 --> 01:27:38.161
Not talking to me is a very
dangerous decision for you right now.

01:27:42.972 --> 01:27:44.369
Not here, I'll call you.

01:27:44.382 --> 01:27:45.789
Look, if I don't hear
from you soon, this is...

01:27:45.790 --> 01:27:47.177
You will.

01:29:53.916 --> 01:29:56.858
Don't bother cleaning up,
we won't be here that long.

01:30:05.293 --> 01:30:06.773
You came.

01:30:16.627 --> 01:30:18.028
You look older.

01:30:21.328 --> 01:30:23.961
- You look the same.
- Yeah, right.

01:30:30.600 --> 01:30:33.729
- Mi, we gotta talk.
- So, talk.

01:30:35.071 --> 01:30:36.869
Come on, Mimi, is this the way
you're gonna play it?

01:30:37.071 --> 01:30:39.671
Like we don't know each other?
Like I'm just some adversary?

01:30:39.770 --> 01:30:41.858
- Aren't you?
- Don't...

01:30:41.908 --> 01:30:45.300
Okay, so why am I here?
Why did you smoke me out?

01:30:45.301 --> 01:30:47.813
- "Smoke you out"?
- You went to Donal.

01:30:48.414 --> 01:30:50.651
- I had to.
- Well, I got the message, I'm here.

01:30:54.139 --> 01:30:56.459
Nick, I can't help you,
that's why I'm here.

01:30:56.560 --> 01:30:59.594
I came to tell you.
I figured I owed you that.

01:31:09.357 --> 01:31:12.386
- I have a daughter.
- I know.

01:31:13.624 --> 01:31:15.320
She's almost twelve.

01:31:21.033 --> 01:31:22.404
That's her.

01:31:27.778 --> 01:31:31.584
- What's her name?
- Isabel.

01:31:32.688 --> 01:31:34.288
Your middle name, yeah.

01:31:36.343 --> 01:31:38.047
Didn't you love your wife?

01:31:41.018 --> 01:31:44.780
- More than you can imagine.
- I can imagine...

01:31:44.981 --> 01:31:47.013
Look, I know this child.
She's probably never

01:31:47.026 --> 01:31:49.068
gonna get over what's
happened to her already,

01:31:49.269 --> 01:31:51.160
and she's got a whole life ahead of her.

01:31:52.161 --> 01:31:54.810
- So, I'm asking you just to...
- You're asking me

01:31:55.615 --> 01:32:01.157
to give myself up, so I can
clear you, for the sake of the child.

01:32:03.103 --> 01:32:07.286
I see... everything to protect
the new little family.

01:32:07.786 --> 01:32:11.500
Fuck your principles, fuck anything
else you used to stand for?

01:32:13.408 --> 01:32:16.769
Well, the struggle doesn't end
just because you got tired of it.

01:32:16.871 --> 01:32:19.804
I didn't get tired of it,
I grew up.

01:32:20.609 --> 01:32:22.345
We promised each other we
weren't going to do that.

01:32:22.358 --> 01:32:24.105
Yeah, but it happened.

01:32:29.156 --> 01:32:31.005
I left the movement for the same
reason I joined it

01:32:31.106 --> 01:32:34.031
because I didn't want to see good people's
lives thrown away for nothing.

01:32:36.360 --> 01:32:40.123
You've waited a long time
to tell me that, haven't you?

01:32:41.865 --> 01:32:44.511
And you've been a long time
coming home from the bank.

01:32:49.685 --> 01:32:51.287
You were close to Mimi Lurie's family.

01:32:53.412 --> 01:32:55.744
I wouldn't say close,
my dad knew her dad.

01:32:58.012 --> 01:33:02.396
You went to the same school, same church,
you went on fishing trips together.

01:33:04.154 --> 01:33:05.755
There's something you're not telling me.

01:33:07.350 --> 01:33:08.644
What are you driving at, Shepard?

01:33:08.645 --> 01:33:12.284
We know that Nick Sloan is looking
for something or someone to clear him.

01:33:12.384 --> 01:33:14.744
- I know that's your assumption.
- Could that be Mimi Lurie?

01:33:18.210 --> 01:33:19.581
I'm off the record.

01:33:22.893 --> 01:33:26.767
Think it out. First he'd have to find
her, and convince her to testify.

01:33:26.869 --> 01:33:28.555
Second, she'd have to surrender.

01:33:29.057 --> 01:33:31.596
- But it's a participants testimony.
- That's the point.

01:33:32.898 --> 01:33:35.395
If Mimi comes out of hiding,
and surrenders herself

01:33:35.408 --> 01:33:37.915
to testify that Nick Sloan
wasn't at the bank,

01:33:38.016 --> 01:33:40.236
it's what lawyers call a
declaration against interest.

01:33:40.736 --> 01:33:44.585
Destroys her own possibility of a defense.
It would clear him.

01:33:44.686 --> 01:33:46.507
Why? Why would she do that?
Why would she give

01:33:46.520 --> 01:33:48.350
herself up to a jail
sentence to save him?

01:33:48.749 --> 01:33:51.457
I mean, what is her motivation?
You really she's gonna do that?

01:33:51.458 --> 01:33:52.954
Don't matter what we think.

01:33:54.154 --> 01:33:56.517
- He obviously believes he can convince her.
- Why now?

01:33:58.530 --> 01:34:00.318
Why not do this back then?

01:34:03.843 --> 01:34:05.543
How long have you known about this?

01:34:07.705 --> 01:34:10.223
I'm obviously not the only
person in this conversation

01:34:10.323 --> 01:34:13.802
who knows about her ties to a piece of
property just on the other side of Canada.

01:34:16.310 --> 01:34:19.351
Mr. Osborne, what's the actual charge
against a law enforcement officer who

01:34:19.352 --> 01:34:22.398
fails to follow credible evidence about
the whereabouts of a known fugitive?

01:34:22.499 --> 01:34:25.111
I think there'd be a variety, actually.

01:34:25.916 --> 01:34:27.956
You have information,
why aren't you coming forward?

01:34:30.187 --> 01:34:33.232
Well, you have information too.
So what are you gonna do?

01:34:33.733 --> 01:34:36.362
I'm a journalist.
I'm gonna do what I always do.

01:34:36.462 --> 01:34:39.049
And this information's gonna be on every
computer screen in the next 20 minutes,

01:34:39.050 --> 01:34:40.749
and I'm gonna find out everything
you're hiding from me,

01:34:40.750 --> 01:34:44.205
and I'm gonna expose it in a
very big and very real way.

01:34:45.721 --> 01:34:48.155
You're about to do a lot of damage
to a lot of people.

01:34:49.256 --> 01:34:51.056
You've no idea how much.

01:34:52.484 --> 01:34:57.010
- I think they have it coming.
- On that, you could not be more wrong.

01:34:58.010 --> 01:35:02.105
Innocent people are about to get
swept up in this storm you're unleashing.

01:35:02.906 --> 01:35:05.919
- Trust me.
- Trust you...?

01:35:06.660 --> 01:35:08.057
Tell me something, Mr Osborne.

01:35:08.058 --> 01:35:10.552
- Are you one of those innocent people?
- No, I am not.

01:35:12.915 --> 01:35:14.615
But my daughter is.

01:35:16.353 --> 01:35:17.640
How so?

01:35:24.687 --> 01:35:26.396
I got somethin' I need to do,

01:35:28.029 --> 01:35:30.713
but on my own terms.

01:35:55.098 --> 01:35:56.648
Upper peninsula.

01:36:05.312 --> 01:36:08.291
'Becc, it's Dad.
I'm trying you again.

01:36:08.920 --> 01:36:12.071
Sorry about the messages.

01:36:14.092 --> 01:36:19.092
Listen, if you... when you get a chance,
I need to talk to you, to tell you...

01:36:20.321 --> 01:36:23.959
this... Shepard guy...

01:36:25.317 --> 01:36:27.905
it's important, 'Becc.

01:36:28.768 --> 01:36:32.318
I love you, sweetie.
Call me back, please.

01:36:36.777 --> 01:36:38.332
I don't know why that's
so hard to figure out.

01:36:38.345 --> 01:36:39.909
What makes you think
I was ever gonna be...

01:36:39.910 --> 01:36:42.614
For one thing, I didn't do it.
I wasn't there, Mimi.

01:36:42.715 --> 01:36:44.826
But you should have been,
then everything would have been different.

01:36:45.328 --> 01:36:50.543
Vince lost his cool, completely. You
wouldn't have, nobody would've gotten hurt.

01:36:50.544 --> 01:36:52.870
Somebody didn't get hurt,
somebody got killed.

01:36:52.883 --> 01:36:55.219
A father, a husband,
with a family.

01:36:55.220 --> 01:36:56.954
You think I didn't think
about that when so

01:36:56.967 --> 01:36:58.711
many fathers with families
were being killed?

01:36:58.712 --> 01:36:59.900
And still are!

01:36:59.912 --> 01:37:01.992
You shouldn't have gone, Mimi.
You should've said no.

01:37:04.587 --> 01:37:06.399
- We were done.
- No. You were done.

01:37:07.100 --> 01:37:10.383
- I never was, but you couldn't accept that.
- Mimi...

01:37:11.584 --> 01:37:14.330
You fooled yourself into thinking
I was someone else.

01:37:15.634 --> 01:37:16.674
And you're still doing it.

01:37:18.239 --> 01:37:20.365
I am not the one fooling
myself, it was over!

01:37:20.378 --> 01:37:22.516
It wasn't... over.

01:37:22.718 --> 01:37:24.614
It's still not over.

01:37:25.014 --> 01:37:27.101
Every single thing we said
then, is true today.

01:37:27.202 --> 01:37:30.347
- And every single day, it's getting worse.
- That's not the point.

01:37:30.381 --> 01:37:32.715
It's exactly the point, Nick!

01:37:34.115 --> 01:37:37.372
I won't give myself up
to a system I despise.

01:37:38.274 --> 01:37:41.774
I won't give up my freedom and accept their
version of what life is supposed to be.

01:37:41.775 --> 01:37:45.774
- Mimi, how free are you? Really?
- Well, I'm not in jail.

01:37:46.795 --> 01:37:49.733
I don't expect you to understand.
They have you.

01:37:49.734 --> 01:37:50.734
Oh, like hell.

01:37:50.783 --> 01:37:55.553
A system that protects the super-rich,
and the super, super, super-rich,

01:37:55.554 --> 01:37:57.634
And fucks over everyone else,
and the planet to boot.

01:37:57.638 --> 01:37:59.720
Mimi... Mimi, would
you just stop?

01:38:00.420 --> 01:38:02.972
Everyone who's given up
and given in, they're

01:38:02.985 --> 01:38:05.546
living at the expense of
what they once believed.

01:38:05.547 --> 01:38:09.521
It's so sad!
You understood this,

01:38:10.122 --> 01:38:13.064
- I'm sorry you've forgotten.
- I wish I had forgotten!

01:38:13.463 --> 01:38:15.785
Because my problem is
I can't stop remembering.

01:38:15.985 --> 01:38:20.130
So if you've built a wall so high, more
power to you, you're stronger than I am.

01:38:20.141 --> 01:38:21.811
I'm will turn myself in...

01:38:22.623 --> 01:38:27.735
the day the politicians and corporations
turn themselves in for all they've done.

01:38:28.036 --> 01:38:31.019
That's the day I'll hand myself in.
Scout's fuckin' honor.

01:38:31.120 --> 01:38:32.658
Stop hiding behind your
fucking revolutionary rant.

01:38:32.671 --> 01:38:34.220
Don't turn it on me.

01:38:34.319 --> 01:38:35.775
You know what I see?

01:38:36.278 --> 01:38:39.658
I see the same person.
I see it, kid.

01:38:40.966 --> 01:38:43.050
I see it in your eyes.

01:38:44.921 --> 01:38:47.010
You can hide from everyone
else in the world,

01:38:47.023 --> 01:38:49.122
and be somebody else,
but not with me.

01:38:50.325 --> 01:38:53.472
What are your memories, Mi?
The ones you can't run away from.

01:38:53.673 --> 01:38:54.673
Hey!

01:38:57.400 --> 01:38:59.731
We had a responsibility beyond the cause.

01:39:00.531 --> 01:39:01.918
We had a baby.

01:39:07.223 --> 01:39:10.285
We were so consumed by our principles,

01:39:11.694 --> 01:39:14.440
that we abandoned our most
fundamental duty.

01:39:19.799 --> 01:39:21.924
We were doing our duty, Nick.

01:39:23.028 --> 01:39:24.682
We made a plan, that if
anything ever went wrong,

01:39:24.695 --> 01:39:26.359
Never should have
carried out that plan.

01:39:26.360 --> 01:39:28.692
We would know exactly
what we had to do.

01:39:29.092 --> 01:39:31.196
- We both agreed.
- We were wrong.

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.750
- We had no choice.
- We should have known that we were wrong.

01:39:37.938 --> 01:39:39.522
We both accepted it,

01:39:40.855 --> 01:39:42.363
and we both had to live with it.

01:40:24.925 --> 01:40:26.221
It wasn't a dream...

01:40:28.467 --> 01:40:34.722
it was a possibility,
we could have made a reality.

01:40:35.656 --> 01:40:39.593
We could make them stop.

01:40:40.452 --> 01:40:43.552
Yeah, we could change things,

01:40:44.502 --> 01:40:46.011
if we could make a difference.

01:40:48.251 --> 01:40:49.915
I still believe in that possibility.

01:41:03.766 --> 01:41:05.700
Is that all you believe?

01:41:15.042 --> 01:41:17.455
Can you put me through to
Ben Shepard please?

01:41:19.496 --> 01:41:22.295
Shit! Rebecca!

01:41:22.997 --> 01:41:25.585
What did you say to my dad?
He sounds really upset.

01:41:26.497 --> 01:41:27.892
What do you mean?

01:41:27.905 --> 01:41:29.309
He left me a dozen voice
messages last night,

01:41:29.310 --> 01:41:30.610
he said it had to do with you.

01:41:31.710 --> 01:41:36.507
- What is going on?
- You're gonna have to talk to your father.

01:41:50.354 --> 01:41:51.741
You're up.

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:58.525
I remember when these trees were so small,
you could see clear across the water.

01:42:04.413 --> 01:42:05.801
I saw her.

01:42:08.697 --> 01:42:10.063
What?

01:42:14.835 --> 01:42:17.673
I've went to do Ann Arbor on my way...

01:42:18.794 --> 01:42:21.631
I didn't want to. I just...

01:42:21.940 --> 01:42:24.644
couldn't help myself.

01:42:27.753 --> 01:42:32.366
I sat in my car like
some kind of stalker.

01:42:33.767 --> 01:42:35.066
Mim.

01:42:40.149 --> 01:42:42.979
She's really something, Nicky.

01:42:45.049 --> 01:42:46.521
Truly.

01:42:52.129 --> 01:42:54.234
We always intended to
tell you the truth.

01:42:54.634 --> 01:42:56.409
You always intended...?

01:42:58.580 --> 01:43:02.606
- At the time we felt...
- We hoped that nobody needed to know.

01:43:05.147 --> 01:43:07.594
I never asked about my birth parents,

01:43:08.694 --> 01:43:10.572
I really never needed to know.

01:43:10.673 --> 01:43:14.860
We know. There's no way
to make this easier.

01:43:15.461 --> 01:43:18.493
We redid your identity,
papered a legal adoption.

01:43:18.695 --> 01:43:20.190
None of that matters to me.

01:43:22.424 --> 01:43:24.358
Did you think I
couldn't handle it?

01:43:25.057 --> 01:43:27.057
Sweetie, we gotta talk through this.

01:43:31.712 --> 01:43:33.696
No one's perfect, 'Becc.

01:43:35.463 --> 01:43:37.350
I love you

01:43:41.384 --> 01:43:43.075
I love you too.

01:44:08.382 --> 01:44:10.215
I can't do what you
want me to do, Nicky.

01:44:11.716 --> 01:44:12.770
I know.

01:44:14.940 --> 01:44:18.433
I guess I was hoping you would
become the person who could.

01:44:23.279 --> 01:44:24.754
So it goes.

01:44:48.281 --> 01:44:51.848
- Sir, the local K-9 units are on the way.
- Roger that.

01:44:57.245 --> 01:44:58.611
Hello?

01:45:01.927 --> 01:45:03.416
I'm here alone!

01:45:05.887 --> 01:45:07.150
Hello?

01:45:09.325 --> 01:45:10.629
You?!

01:45:11.729 --> 01:45:13.317
You expecting to see somebody else?

01:45:16.100 --> 01:45:18.812
- She here?
- Who're we talking about?

01:45:18.912 --> 01:45:22.708
Who're we talkin' about. Mimi Lurie!
That's who you came to see, right?

01:45:23.008 --> 01:45:26.021
Mimi Lurie. That's who
you came to see, correct?

01:45:26.223 --> 01:45:27.061
Why would I do that?

01:45:27.074 --> 01:45:27.922
She could testify that
you weren't at the bank.

01:45:28.122 --> 01:45:30.393
Almost sounds like a
news story, doesn't it?

01:45:31.510 --> 01:45:35.290
- Unfortunately, I need a source.
- Really? Must be a new policy.

01:45:36.098 --> 01:45:37.365
Is she here, Nick?

01:45:38.181 --> 01:45:39.465
She never was.

01:45:44.315 --> 01:45:46.203
- You call 'em?
- No.

01:45:50.787 --> 01:45:52.921
Well you got yourself a story, kid.
Congratulations.

01:45:52.934 --> 01:45:55.079
I hope you're satisfied.

01:45:55.687 --> 01:45:57.033
I don't wanna see a guy
go to jail for the

01:45:57.046 --> 01:45:58.403
rest of his life for
something he didn't do.

01:45:58.604 --> 01:46:00.422
Is that what passes for
idealism these days?

01:46:00.435 --> 01:46:02.263
Is Mimi gonna surrender?

01:46:03.188 --> 01:46:05.796
- No.
- No. So, where are you going?

01:46:05.995 --> 01:46:08.712
Well, before she can not surrender,
she has to first not get caught.

01:46:08.912 --> 01:46:10.632
I don't understand, there
was an easier way.

01:46:11.109 --> 01:46:12.372
Usually is.

01:46:13.497 --> 01:46:15.506
You'll learn that lesson.

01:46:16.106 --> 01:46:17.693
You know, I met your daughter.

01:46:21.727 --> 01:46:23.402
Your older daughter.

01:46:25.590 --> 01:46:28.715
Then you really do have
yourself a story, don't ya'?

01:46:29.119 --> 01:46:31.595
I'm guessing you didn't just
stumble into this information...

01:46:31.796 --> 01:46:33.096
by my count, there are exactly

01:46:33.499 --> 01:46:35.353
four people on the planet that...

01:46:35.554 --> 01:46:36.754
knew about this...

01:46:39.228 --> 01:46:41.627
You get let in on something
like this, Ben...

01:46:41.640 --> 01:46:44.049
you get answers, but not
the ones you think.

01:46:44.550 --> 01:46:46.046
Secrets are a dangerous thing, Ben.

01:46:47.146 --> 01:46:49.986
We all think we want to know them,
but if you've kept one to yourself...

01:46:50.384 --> 01:46:52.163
You come to understand
that doing so means that

01:46:52.176 --> 01:46:53.965
you may learn something
about somebody else,

01:46:54.866 --> 01:46:57.501
but you also discover
something about yourself.

01:46:58.713 --> 01:47:00.097
I hope you're ready for that.

01:47:01.501 --> 01:47:03.942
At this point,
I have no more secrets.

01:47:05.788 --> 01:47:06.871
You're a smart guy...

01:47:07.771 --> 01:47:09.148
Hold on, I'm not gonna hurt you.

01:47:09.855 --> 01:47:12.889
You know exactly what motivates me,
and has for the last thirty years.

01:47:12.990 --> 01:47:15.701
What you're gonna have to
figure out, is what motivates you.

01:47:16.102 --> 01:47:19.442
- I hope you like the answer.
- Hold on. Nick. Nick!

01:47:19.443 --> 01:47:23.266
When the FBI comes, they'll follow me.
They'll never know she was here.

01:47:38.196 --> 01:47:39.459
There he is.

01:48:48.202 --> 01:48:52.652
What's that? That's it.
Come on! Come on.

01:48:56.714 --> 01:49:01.445
Alright... we'll take up, you
guys flank around from there.

01:49:45.182 --> 01:49:45.965
There he is!

01:49:52.270 --> 01:49:53.636
Nicholas Sloan!

01:49:55.083 --> 01:50:00.900
You're under arrest for the
murder of Hugh Kroessna.

01:50:10.080 --> 01:50:12.180
Can't say I'm happy to see you.

01:51:49.342 --> 01:51:53.450
Mimi Lurie, last remaining fugitive
from the 1980 Bank of Michigan robbery,

01:51:53.550 --> 01:51:56.946
surrendered herself to authorities today
near Drummond Island, Michigan,

01:51:57.047 --> 01:51:58.947
just across the water from Canada.

01:51:59.047 --> 01:52:03.126
She confessed to her role in the robbery,
which resulted in the death of a guard.

01:52:03.427 --> 01:52:05.736
Charges have been dropped
against Nicholas Sloan,

01:52:05.936 --> 01:52:08.856
long thought to be a co-conspirator
in the robbery.

01:52:08.957 --> 01:52:11.693
No comment yet from
Sloan, who is expected to

01:52:11.706 --> 01:52:14.453
be released from custody
as early as tomorrow.

01:52:14.553 --> 01:52:15.653
In other news today...

01:53:17.600 --> 01:53:20.284
I have nothing to say.
