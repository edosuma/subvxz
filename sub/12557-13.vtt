EVERYTHING'S AS QUIET AS A...

10:08.843 --> 10:11.944
HOW AM I GOING
TO GET BACK NOW?

10:16.065 --> 10:18.567
I ONLY GOT 15 MINUTES.

10:21.704 --> 10:23.706
LET ME TRY TO
UNDERSTAND THIS, SIR.

10:23.741 --> 10:26.208
YOU HAVE THIS
FUNNY-LOOKING HAT, NO PANTS,

10:26.243 --> 10:28.711

10:30.614 --> 10:32.465
THIS IS A TIME HELMET.

10:32.500 --> 10:33.716
I'M FROM 1890.

10:33.751 --> 10:36.218
THAT'S WHERE I'VE
GOT TO GET BACK TO.

10:36.253 --> 10:38.087
AND YOUR TROUSERS?

10:38.122 --> 10:40.589
I HUNG THEM UP

10:40.624 --> 10:41.841
YOU'RE FROM 1890?

10:41.876 --> 10:43.092
WHAT PROOF HAVE YOU?

10:43.127 --> 10:44.343
PROOF?

10:44.378 --> 10:47.480
YES. AH! THAT WATCH.

10:47.515 --> 10:48.731
THOSE CLOTHES.

10:48.766 --> 10:49.982
WHERE DID
YOU GET THEM?

10:50.599 --> 10:51.851
THEY'RE MINE.

10:51.886 --> 10:53.736
IS IT POSSIBLE?!

10:54.987 --> 10:57.490
QUICKLY- WHO
IS THE PRESIDENT?

10:57.525 --> 10:58.741
YOU MEAN
BENJAMIN HARRISON?

10:58.776 --> 10:59.992
BENJAMIN HARRISON.

11:00.027 --> 11:01.243
AND BEFORE HIM?

11:01.278 --> 11:02.495
GROVER CLEVELAND.

11:08.786 --> 11:10.619
WELL, THAT'S
NO NEWS TO ME.

11:10.654 --> 11:13.122
HOW TO GET BACK
WOULD BE NEWS.

11:13.157 --> 11:15.007
AND THIS IS
THE DEVICE, EH?

11:15.042 --> 11:16.876
HOW DOES IT WORK?

11:16.911 --> 11:18.127
WELL, YOU...

11:18.162 --> 11:20.012
WELL, I DON'T KNOW!

11:20.047 --> 11:21.881
SEE, I'M ONLY
THE JANITOR.

11:21.916 --> 11:23.132
JANITOR, HMM?

11:23.167 --> 11:25.634
HMM. PRIMITIVE,
BUT FUNCTIONAL.

11:25.669 --> 11:26.886
YES, YES, YES.

11:26.921 --> 11:28.771
FASCINATING.

11:50.077 --> 11:51.293
WHAT IS IT?

11:51.911 --> 11:53.162
CAN YOU FIX IT?

11:53.197 --> 11:55.047
WE CAN FIX ANYTHING.

11:55.082 --> 11:56.298
GOOD.

11:57.550 --> 11:59.418

12:05.424 --> 12:07.927
THURSDAY?!

12:18.821 --> 12:20.072
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

12:20.107 --> 12:23.192
THIS MAN MUST
GET BACK TO 1890.

12:23.227 --> 12:25.077
OH, YOU'RE IN
THE WRONG BLOCK.

12:25.112 --> 12:26.946
THIS IS
ONLY 1600.

12:26.981 --> 12:28.197
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

12:28.232 --> 12:30.082
THAT'S A TIME HELMET.

12:30.117 --> 12:32.585
AND THIS MAN
IS FROM THE YEAR 1890.

12:32.620 --> 12:35.704
WHAT ARE YOU,
SOME KIND OF NUT?

12:35.739 --> 12:36.956
I'M AN ELECTRONIC
SCIENTIST.

12:37.590 --> 12:39.458
NOW, JUST LEND ME
THOSE TOOLS...

12:39.493 --> 12:40.709
DON'T TOUCH!

I'M GOING TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

13:00.648 --> 13:01.864
YEAH.

13:01.899 --> 13:05.618
THAT MAN DOESN'T
HAVE ALL HIS BUTTONS.

13:11.240 --> 13:13.125
OH, YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME, HUH?

13:13.160 --> 13:14.994
WELL, I'LL PROVE IT TO YOU.

13:15.029 --> 13:16.879
LOOK AT THESE PAPERS.

13:16.914 --> 13:18.130
WE BARELY HAVE
15 MINUTES

13:18.165 --> 13:20.499

TIME CONTINUUM.

13:20.534 --> 13:21.750
IF YOU'LL REPAIR...

13:21.785 --> 13:23.002
EXCUSE ME.

13:24.253 --> 13:25.504
THIS FELLER SAYS

13:25.539 --> 13:28.007
HE HASN'T GOT
ALL HIS BUTTONS.

13:28.042 --> 13:30.509
WHAT'S HE MEAN,
HE HAS NO BUTTONS?

13:30.544 --> 13:33.646
MEANS HE HAS NO MENTAL
FACILITIES, YES?

13:33.681 --> 13:34.897
WHO SAID THAT?

13:34.932 --> 13:37.399
THIS FELLER HERE
IN THE WINDOW.

13:37.434 --> 13:39.268
THAT'S TV!

13:39.303 --> 13:40.519
WHO'S TV?

13:40.554 --> 13:42.404
TV- TELEVISION.

13:42.439 --> 13:44.907
OH, YOU WOULDN'T
UNDERSTAND IF I TOLD...

13:44.942 --> 13:48.027
WHAT ON EARTH ARE YOU
DOING, YOUNG MAN?

13:48.062 --> 13:49.912
DON'T DO THAT
TO ME, PAL.

13:49.947 --> 13:51.163
LOOK, LOOK, LOOK.

14:41.749 --> 14:43.582
YOU SURE THIS ISN'T

14:43.617 --> 14:45.467
SOME KIND OF
A COFFEE MAKER?

14:45.502 --> 14:47.336
NO, SIR, THAT'S A
VERY SCIENTIFIC

14:47.371 --> 14:49.221
PIECE OF EQUIPMENT.

15:13.245 --> 15:15.114
FIVE DOLLARS, PLEASE.

15:30.512 --> 15:32.765

THING IN THERE?

15:32.800 --> 15:34.016
OH, WELL,
THAT, YOU SEE...

15:34.051 --> 15:35.267
THAT IS A TRANSITRON.

DON'T... DON'T
TOUCH MY TOOLS,

15:37.171 --> 15:38.387
IF YOU DON'T MIND.

15:38.422 --> 15:40.889
I'M MERELY TRYING
TO POINT OUT TO YOU THAT,

15:40.924 --> 15:42.775
IN ORDER TO
FACILITATE THAT...

15:42.810 --> 15:44.643
DON'T POINT WITH
MY TOOLS, PLEASE.

15:44.678 --> 15:47.780
WOULD YOU ALLOW ME

16:31.358 --> 16:33.075
HEY...

16:33.110 --> 16:34.576
WHAT'S THE IDEA

16:34.611 --> 16:36.445
OF RUNNING AROUND
THE STREET

16:36.480 --> 16:38.330
WITH NO PANTS ON?

17:06.474 --> 17:08.977
ALLEY... OOP!

17:40.759 --> 17:42.010
WELL, IS IT READY?

17:42.045 --> 17:43.896
COUPLE OF SMALL,
MINOR ADJUSTMENTS,

17:43.931 --> 17:45.764
YOU'LL
BE ALL SET.

17:45.799 --> 17:47.649
I ENVY YOU
YOUR TRIP, SIR.

17:47.684 --> 17:51.653
1890 IS A
WONDERFUL PERIOD.

17:51.688 --> 17:54.156
MMM. FOR INSTANCE,
NO INCOME TAX.

17:54.191 --> 17:56.024
INCOME TAX?

17:56.059 --> 17:58.527
I AM A SCHOLAR
OF THAT PERIOD, SIR.

17:58.562 --> 18:02.281
IT HAS A CHARM- NAY,
A FASCINATION- FOR ME.

18:02.316 --> 18:03.532
THE VERY THOUGHT

18:03.567 --> 18:07.286
OF HAVING LIVED
IN THOSE HALCYON DAYS...

18:07.321 --> 18:09.171
I'LL SURE BE GLAD
TO GET BACK.

18:09.788 --> 18:11.039
IF I EVER DO.

18:11.074 --> 18:13.542
HOW MUCH TIME
IS THERE LEFT?

18:13.577 --> 18:14.793
OH...

18:14.828 --> 18:16.678
WE GOT LESS THAN
FIVE MINUTES!

18:16.713 --> 18:19.798
MMM. TELL ME
ABOUT YOUR TOWN, SIR.

18:19.833 --> 18:22.935
WHERE, FOR INSTANCE,
MIGHT A SCIENTIST
FIND EMPLOYMENT?

18:22.970 --> 18:24.186
YOU A SCIENTIST?

18:24.221 --> 18:26.688
YES. ARE THERE ANY

18:26.723 --> 18:27.940
WELL, PROFESSOR GILBERT.

18:27.975 --> 18:29.808
I WORK FOR HIM.

18:29.843 --> 18:31.059
THERE YOU ARE, GENTLEMEN.

18:31.094 --> 18:32.945
ALL FIXED.

18:32.980 --> 18:35.197
GOOD. WHAT
DO WE DO NOW?

18:35.232 --> 18:36.315
UH... PAY ME.

18:36.350 --> 18:37.566
HMM?

18:37.601 --> 18:40.068
PAY THE MAN,

18:42.821 --> 18:45.324
AH! THAT'S JUST
THE RIGHT AMOUNT.

18:45.359 --> 18:46.575
THANK YOU.

18:46.610 --> 18:48.460
UH... HOW DOES
IT WORK?

18:48.495 --> 18:50.963
OH, YOU JUST
SET THIS DIAL.

18:54.868 --> 18:56.084
GOOD!

18:58.005 --> 19:00.472
HEY, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING?

19:00.507 --> 19:02.341
I INTEND TO
USE IT MYSELF

19:02.376 --> 19:03.592
IN EXACTLY
THREE MINUTES.

19:03.627 --> 19:04.843
YOU CAN'T DO THAT!

19:04.878 --> 19:06.094
BUT IAM
DOING IT, SIR.

19:06.129 --> 19:07.980
I'M RETURNING TO
THAT TIME OF BLISS

19:08.015 --> 19:08.597
AND SIMPLE PLEASURES!

19:08.632 --> 19:09.848
AND LEAVING ME HERE?

19:09.883 --> 19:11.733
YOUR FATE IS
UNIMPORTANT, SIR.

19:11.768 --> 19:13.602
YOU ARE A JANITOR.

19:13.637 --> 19:14.853
I AM A SCIENTIST!

19:14.888 --> 19:16.104
WHY, I...

19:16.139 --> 19:17.356
STAND BACK!

19:17.391 --> 19:19.241
IN LESS THAN
THREE MINUTES,

19:19.276 --> 19:21.743
I SHALL HAVE ESCAPED
THIS AGE OF MADNESS!

19:24.746 --> 19:25.364
LOOK, LOOK.

19:25.399 --> 19:27.249
I BROUGHT A CHICKEN
WITH ME

19:27.284 --> 19:29.117
ALL THE WAY FROM 1890.

19:29.152 --> 19:30.369
ALL I DID WAS HOLD IT.

19:30.404 --> 19:32.254
WE CAN GO BACK TOGETHER.

19:32.289 --> 19:33.505
YOU'RE LYING, SIR.

19:33.540 --> 19:34.756
I AM NOT.

20:25.959 --> 20:28.310
HEY, LOOK OUT!

20:31.430 --> 20:34.182
GET THAT NUT
OUT OF HERE.

20:34.217 --> 20:37.319
1890, HERE I COME.

23:48.877 --> 23:50.762
"TO EACH HIS OWN."

23:50.797 --> 23:52.631
SO GOES ANOTHER OLD PHRASE

23:52.666 --> 23:56.384
TO WHICH MR. WOODROW MULLIGAN
WOULD HEARTILY SUBSCRIBE.

23:56.419 --> 23:58.887
FOR HE HAS LEARNED,
DEFINITELY THE HARD WAY,

23:58.922 --> 24:02.023
THAT THERE IS MUCH WISDOM
IN A THIRD OLD PHRASE

24:02.058 --> 24:03.892
WHICH GOES AS FOLLOWS:

24:03.927 --> 24:05.777
"STAY IN YOUR OWN BACKYARD."

24:05.812 --> 24:07.646
TO WHICH IT MIGHT BE ADDED,

24:07.681 --> 24:10.782
"AND, IF POSSIBLE, ASSIST
OTHERS TO STAY IN THEIRS."

24:10.817 --> 24:13.285
VIA, OF COURSE,
THE TWILIGHT ZONE.

24:15.487 --> 24:17.989
ROD SERLING,
CREATOR OFTHE TWILIGHT ZONE,

24:18.024 --> 24:19.875
WILL TELL YOU
ABOUT NEXT WEEK'S STORY

24:19.910 --> 24:22.377
AFTER THIS MESSAGE.

24:23.979 --> 24:25.664
AND NOW, MR. SERLING.

24:25.699 --> 24:27.549
NEXT WEEK, ONTHE TWILIGHT ZONE,

24:27.584 --> 24:29.417
YOU'LL FIND YOURSELF
INEXPLICABLY ENTANGLED

24:29.452 --> 24:30.669
IN THIS DARK DUNGEON.

24:30.704 --> 24:33.171
YOU'LL MEET AN INCREDIBLE
GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO, LIKE YOU,

24:33.206 --> 24:35.674
