WEBVTT

00:01.449 --> 00:04.004
Well, we're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:04.142 --> 00:07.283
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:07.421 --> 00:11.666
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:11.804 --> 00:14.773
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:14.911 --> 00:17.914
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:18.052 --> 00:21.883
We finally got
a piece of the pie

00:23.402 --> 00:25.922
Fish don't fry
in the kitchen

00:26.060 --> 00:28.545
Beans don't burn
on the grill

00:28.683 --> 00:31.134
Took a whole lot of tryin'

00:31.272 --> 00:33.930
Just to get up that hill

00:34.068 --> 00:36.415
Now we're up
in the big leagues

00:36.553 --> 00:39.039
Gettin' our turn at bat

00:39.177 --> 00:41.558
As long as we live,
it's you and me, baby

00:41.696 --> 00:43.250
There ain't nothin' wrong
with that

00:43.388 --> 00:46.149
We're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:46.287 --> 00:49.221
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:49.359 --> 00:53.674
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:53.812 --> 00:56.504
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:56.642 --> 00:59.749
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:59.887 --> 01:06.204
We finally got
a piece of the pie

01:46.140 --> 01:47.107
Oh!

02:06.781 --> 02:08.576
Don't you move
this pillow no more.

02:08.714 --> 02:10.820
George, can't you take
your nap in the bedroom?

02:10.958 --> 02:12.580
Florence just
vacuumed in here.

02:12.718 --> 02:14.099
So what?
I'm a clean sleeper.

02:15.790 --> 02:17.516
George!
Look, Weezy, it's Sunday.

02:17.654 --> 02:19.208
I ain't doing nothing
today but relaxing.

02:19.346 --> 02:21.002
Now, I got my pillow,
I got my...

02:21.141 --> 02:22.521
What happened to my beer?

02:22.659 --> 02:23.833
Don't ask me.

02:23.971 --> 02:25.041
Did you take my beer?

02:25.179 --> 02:27.216
Oh, was that yours?
I poured that out.

02:27.354 --> 02:29.252
You what?
That was good beer.

02:29.390 --> 02:30.943
Sure was.
I poured it into me.

02:35.603 --> 02:37.778
Ain't nothing sacred
around here?

02:37.916 --> 02:39.607
Do you want me to fix
the sandwiches now,
Mrs. Jefferson?

02:39.745 --> 02:40.815
Yes, please, Florence.

02:40.953 --> 02:42.265
Good, because I'm hungry.

02:42.403 --> 02:43.887
George, they're not for you.

02:44.025 --> 02:45.958
Helen and Jenny
are coming down here.

02:46.096 --> 02:48.340
We are helping Jenny
pick out her china pattern.

02:48.478 --> 02:51.343
Oh, sure, that kind of work
makes you real hungry.

02:51.481 --> 02:53.173
Why did you invite them
down here, anyway?

02:53.311 --> 02:55.899
Because I thought
you'd be down at the store.

02:56.037 --> 02:57.763
Can't you find
something to do?

02:57.901 --> 02:58.971
I got something to do.

02:59.109 --> 03:00.456
Good. What is it?

03:00.594 --> 03:02.182
Nothing.

03:02.320 --> 03:03.907
And I need
all day to do it.

03:06.772 --> 03:08.291
Oh, hello, Mr. Bentley.

03:08.429 --> 03:09.568
Good morning,
Mrs. Jefferson.

03:09.706 --> 03:11.674
Is the master at home?

03:11.812 --> 03:13.779
Yes.
Oh, good.
May I speak with him?

03:13.917 --> 03:14.849
No.

03:14.987 --> 03:16.782
Oh, there you are.

03:16.920 --> 03:19.544
I'll bet you're wondering
what to do with
yourself today, eh?

03:19.682 --> 03:20.752
No, I ain't.
Good.

03:20.890 --> 03:22.616
Because I met
this fellow at the UN,

03:22.754 --> 03:25.032
a charming chap
with the Greek delegation,

03:25.170 --> 03:26.378
Nick Dapapopolis.

03:26.516 --> 03:30.106
No, it's Dick Napadopolis.
Or is it Papadop...

03:30.244 --> 03:31.211
Bentley!

03:31.349 --> 03:32.626
Anyway, this Greek geezer,

03:32.764 --> 03:34.490
said he could get me
tickets to anything,

03:34.628 --> 03:37.493
and I told him I'd love
to see the play Chicago.

03:37.631 --> 03:39.184
Weezy, why'd you let him in?

03:39.322 --> 03:40.979
Unfortunately,
he thought I said,

03:41.117 --> 03:43.015
"I'd love to see
Chicago play."

03:43.153 --> 03:44.845
So he got me
three tickets

03:44.983 --> 03:46.950
to the Chicago Bears
football game with the Jets,

03:47.088 --> 03:48.504
but I can't go today.

03:48.642 --> 03:50.230
Oh, why didn't you
give them back?

03:50.368 --> 03:52.508
I couldn't. He was
recalled to Greece

03:52.646 --> 03:55.235
in a bit of a hurry
as a result of
a navel incident.

03:55.373 --> 03:57.167
Oh, that sounds serious.

03:57.306 --> 03:58.893
Yes. He tried
to remove a ruby

03:59.031 --> 04:01.171
from a Turkish belly
dancer's bellybutton.

04:02.932 --> 04:04.968
Why are you telling us
this on my day off?

04:05.106 --> 04:06.970
Well, I thought you might
be able to use the tickets.

04:07.108 --> 04:08.800
I know how you love
a good scrap.

04:08.938 --> 04:10.111
Not today, Bentley.

04:10.250 --> 04:12.079
Today I'd appreciate
a little peace and quiet.

04:12.459 --> 04:13.529
Are you sure?

04:13.667 --> 04:16.117
Sorry, Bentley, no sale.
Oh, Mr. Jefferson...

04:16.256 --> 04:18.361
No. No.
Mr. Jefferson, wait!

04:18.499 --> 04:20.881
Mr. Jefferson,
they're very good seats,
he said.

04:21.019 --> 04:22.641
High up in the very
last row.

04:23.815 --> 04:24.885
That way, you don't
have to look up

04:25.023 --> 04:26.438
when they throw
the ball in the air.

04:28.475 --> 04:29.545
The only play
I want to see

04:29.683 --> 04:31.616
is the Jefferson touchdown
on that sofa. Huh.

04:34.135 --> 04:37.000
George, can't you please
move your nap
to the bedroom?

04:37.138 --> 04:39.969
I got a better idea.
Why don't you move your
lunch to the kitchen.

04:40.107 --> 04:41.108
I can't serve

04:41.246 --> 04:43.386
the Willises' lunch
in our kitchen!

04:43.524 --> 04:45.146
Well, serve it
in their kitchen.

04:46.872 --> 04:48.253
Hi.
Oh, hi. Come in.

04:48.391 --> 04:50.186
Hi, Louise. I hope
we're not too early.

04:50.324 --> 04:51.567
Wrong as usual.

04:51.705 --> 04:54.535
Oh, hello there,
Mr. Jefferson.

04:54.673 --> 04:56.710
Oh, I didn't know
you'd be here
today, George.

04:56.848 --> 04:57.849
Oh, that makes two of us.

04:57.987 --> 04:59.057
I didn't know
you'd be here either.

05:01.162 --> 05:02.405
How's Tom?

05:02.543 --> 05:04.269
I don't know, I'm not
speaking to him.

05:04.407 --> 05:06.685
Finally wised up, huh?

05:09.032 --> 05:10.275
Huh.

05:10.413 --> 05:12.035
Daddy is not
himself today.

05:12.726 --> 05:14.037
Why? What happened?

05:14.175 --> 05:15.453
We went to a party
last night

05:15.591 --> 05:17.869
and Tom behaved
like an idiot.

05:18.007 --> 05:19.353
I thought you said
he wasn't himself.

05:23.737 --> 05:25.290
Just ignore him.
What happened?

05:25.428 --> 05:27.775
Remember I told you about
the last party we went to,

05:27.913 --> 05:29.743
where Tom had
too much to drink?

05:29.881 --> 05:32.470
The one where he gave
his impersonation
of Jacques Cousteau?

05:32.608 --> 05:34.299
How'd he do that?

05:34.437 --> 05:36.301
He stood on his head
in the punchbowl.

05:39.373 --> 05:41.306
But two drinks
are Tom's limit.

05:41.444 --> 05:44.171
So before we left,
he promised me that
he wouldn't touch a drop.

05:44.309 --> 05:47.347
Then when he got there,
he said he felt funny without
something in his hands.

05:47.485 --> 05:50.315
So he ordered one martini,
just to hold.

05:50.453 --> 05:51.834
Well, what was
wrong with that?

05:51.972 --> 05:53.214
Well, he held it
for two minutes

05:53.353 --> 05:55.941
and then decided
that his stomach
could hold it better.

05:56.079 --> 05:58.496
As it turned out,
his stomach held
three of them.

05:59.117 --> 06:00.498
Yeah, but not for long.

06:01.637 --> 06:03.259
He spent
the rest of the night
in the bathroom.

06:03.397 --> 06:05.123
Girl, he turned green!

06:05.261 --> 06:07.125
That's better than his
normal color.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.924
George, will you
cut it out?

06:13.062 --> 06:14.270
I'm paying him
a compliment!

06:19.379 --> 06:21.415
Uh... Hi, Tom.

06:21.553 --> 06:23.797
We were just
talking about you.

06:23.935 --> 06:25.557
Huh! He still looks
white to me.

06:27.697 --> 06:29.699
I'd like a quiet word
with Helen.

06:29.837 --> 06:32.184
Oh, well, come in.

06:32.322 --> 06:35.878
Helen, my darling,
I have a wonderful
surprise for you.

06:36.016 --> 06:38.777
You remember flushing
the car keys down
the toilet last night?

06:39.709 --> 06:41.262
Oh, come on, Helen.

06:41.401 --> 06:44.300
Harry Bentley
gave me tickets for
the football game today.

06:44.438 --> 06:45.577
How about coming with me?

06:45.715 --> 06:47.683
I'm in no mood
to watch grown men

06:47.821 --> 06:49.823
getting paid for bumping
into each other.

06:49.961 --> 06:51.652
Aw, Helen, I said
I was sorry.

06:51.790 --> 06:53.896
Anybody can be sorry
after he's done something.

06:54.034 --> 06:56.243
Why can't you be sorry
before you do something?

06:56.899 --> 06:57.865
What?
Oh, Tom,

06:58.003 --> 06:59.798
just go on to your
football game, okay?

06:59.936 --> 07:00.972
Hi.

07:01.110 --> 07:02.801
Hello, stuff.
JENNY: Hi.

07:03.837 --> 07:05.286
TOM: Say, Lionel!

07:05.425 --> 07:06.943
How about you?
I've got tickets for
the Jets and Bears.

07:07.081 --> 07:08.082
You want to come?

07:08.220 --> 07:09.601
Hey, that's a great...

07:11.500 --> 07:12.915
No, thanks, Mr. Willis.

07:13.053 --> 07:14.019
I'm going to stay here

07:14.157 --> 07:15.504
and help Jenny
pick out our china.

07:15.642 --> 07:16.608
Oh, that's all right.

07:16.746 --> 07:18.127
You don't have to stay
just because of me.

07:18.265 --> 07:20.681
Great. Besides,
picking out china
is women's work.

07:20.819 --> 07:22.407
It's what?

07:22.545 --> 07:24.996
What I mean is they do
such a wonderful job.

07:30.208 --> 07:31.554
Come on, Lionel.
Let's go.

07:33.211 --> 07:34.661
Are you sure you don't
want me to stay here?

07:34.799 --> 07:37.215
Oh, sure. Enjoy the game.
Yeah.

07:37.353 --> 07:38.872
George, why don't
you go with them?

07:39.010 --> 07:40.390
The air will do you good.

07:40.529 --> 07:42.116
If everybody would clear
the hell out of here,

07:42.254 --> 07:43.670
I'd have
all the air I need.

07:47.501 --> 07:49.365
Lionel would like you
to go with him.

07:50.193 --> 07:51.505
Wouldn't you, Lionel?

07:51.643 --> 07:53.024
Oh, not if he
doesn't want...

07:55.923 --> 07:58.547
Hey, come on, Pop.
It'll be a great game.

07:58.685 --> 07:59.824
I ain't going
to no game.

07:59.962 --> 08:01.515
Look, we'll have
a great time.

08:01.653 --> 08:03.310
How are we gonna get there?
You know the cabs
are on strike.

08:03.448 --> 08:04.656
I ain't going on no subway.

08:04.794 --> 08:06.140
No problem.

08:06.278 --> 08:08.142
They've got special charter
buses going to the stadium.

08:08.280 --> 08:09.627
I don't believe in buses.

08:09.765 --> 08:12.422
Aw, come on.
We'll let you
ride up front.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.015
Hey, Pop.

08:19.153 --> 08:20.948
Remember how you used
to take me to the games
when I was a little kid?

08:21.086 --> 08:23.226
I don't want to go.
Oh, please, Pop?

08:23.364 --> 08:25.712
Hey, look, it will be
just like old times.

08:25.850 --> 08:27.990
Hmm. Yeah, it would,
wouldn't it?

08:29.094 --> 08:30.682
Okay, you win.

08:30.820 --> 08:32.684
But you got to
promise me one thing.

08:32.822 --> 08:34.548
What's that?

08:34.686 --> 08:35.998
You won't make me
get up every 10 minutes to
take you to the bathroom.

08:47.147 --> 08:50.426
Oh, I'll never forget
our first set of china.

08:50.564 --> 08:51.841
Who picked out
the pattern?

08:52.255 --> 08:53.256
Texaco.

09:00.678 --> 09:04.820
Oh, I think this pattern
will look real good
with the crystal.

09:04.958 --> 09:06.891
LOUISE: Oh, yes.
So do I!

09:07.029 --> 09:08.444
HELEN: What do
you think, Jenny?

09:08.582 --> 09:10.032
Jenny?
Huh?

09:10.170 --> 09:11.274
What do you think?

09:11.723 --> 09:13.414
Oh, uh...

09:13.553 --> 09:15.451
I think I'm going to go
get a drink of water.

09:18.040 --> 09:20.180
For somebody
who's going to be getting
all this nice stuff

09:20.318 --> 09:22.113
she sure don't
act too happy.

09:22.251 --> 09:23.735
I better see
if she's okay.

09:25.185 --> 09:26.842
Jenny's probably
just nervous.

09:26.980 --> 09:28.671
Weddings can do that
to you, you know.

09:28.809 --> 09:29.845
No, I don't know.

09:32.710 --> 09:34.953
The only time
anybody ever asked me
to pick out china,

09:35.091 --> 09:36.127
it was on a map.

09:45.792 --> 09:47.690
Jenny? Is there
something wrong?

09:47.828 --> 09:50.417
Hmm. No. I'm just
thirsty, that's all.

09:51.798 --> 09:54.559
Well, you've hardly said
two words all afternoon.

09:54.697 --> 09:55.698
Now, what's bothering you?

09:57.217 --> 09:58.218
Well...

09:59.978 --> 10:01.808
Well, it's Lionel.

10:01.946 --> 10:03.292
It's Lionel?
What's he done?

10:03.879 --> 10:05.259
Nothing.

10:05.397 --> 10:07.399
Well, that explains
everything.

10:07.537 --> 10:09.229
Well, no, I don't mean
that it's Lionel.

10:09.367 --> 10:11.507
It... It's me.

10:11.645 --> 10:14.130
What have you done?
Nothing!

10:14.268 --> 10:15.960
Now, Jenny.
If we're going to get
to the bottom...

10:16.098 --> 10:18.756
I mean, I used to be
so sure about Lionel and me.

10:18.894 --> 10:19.895
But now, I...

10:20.689 --> 10:22.276
I'm scared.

10:23.174 --> 10:24.175
Scared about what?

10:25.659 --> 10:27.488
I don't know
if I really love him.

10:30.215 --> 10:31.285
Oh, come on.

10:31.423 --> 10:33.425
You've just got
the blues, that's all.

10:33.563 --> 10:34.910
You'll get over it.

10:35.048 --> 10:36.152
No, I won't.

10:37.326 --> 10:38.534
I should have
wanted Lionel

10:38.672 --> 10:40.674
to stay to help me pick
out the china today, but...

10:40.812 --> 10:41.951
Why did I let him go?

10:42.089 --> 10:43.953
Oh, there's nothing
wrong with that.

10:44.091 --> 10:46.162
Maybe I didn't
want him around.

10:46.300 --> 10:48.578
Well, I feel the same way
about your daddy sometimes.

10:48.717 --> 10:50.097
But that doesn't mean
I don't love him.

10:50.235 --> 10:51.651
Yeah, but with you,
it's different.

10:51.789 --> 10:53.342
You're an old
married couple.

10:57.553 --> 10:59.900
For instance, the other day
I was waiting at school

11:00.038 --> 11:01.971
for Lionel to pick me up.
Mmm-hmm.

11:02.109 --> 11:04.042
All of a sudden,
I got real scared.

11:05.009 --> 11:06.804
I couldn't
picture his face.

11:06.942 --> 11:08.150
For a couple
of minutes there,

11:08.288 --> 11:09.979
I honestly couldn't remember
what he looked like.

11:10.117 --> 11:12.154
Well, he's black.
That ought to narrow
it down.

11:13.845 --> 11:15.260
This is nothing
to joke about.

11:15.398 --> 11:17.435
I was beginning to think
there was something
wrong with my brain.

11:17.573 --> 11:19.506
No, honey,
there's something wrong
with your feet.

11:20.645 --> 11:22.129
What?
They're getting cold.

11:23.165 --> 11:24.373
What does that mean?

11:24.511 --> 11:25.788
It means, Jenny,

11:25.926 --> 11:28.757
that you've got a bad case
of pre-marriage jitters.

11:28.895 --> 11:30.482
No, it's not
as simple as that.

11:33.140 --> 11:36.109
Last week,
I almost went out
with Michael Harding.

11:36.247 --> 11:37.213
Who's Michael Harding?

11:37.351 --> 11:39.975
Ooh, a fine brother
in my sociology class.

11:42.425 --> 11:44.842
Every girl I know
wants to date him.

11:44.980 --> 11:46.464
Last week, he asked me.

11:46.602 --> 11:48.190
Did you go?
No, I didn't.

11:48.328 --> 11:49.501
Oh, well,
that settles it.

11:51.296 --> 11:54.196
You didn't
go out with him because
you still love Lionel.

11:54.334 --> 11:55.922
No, I think I didn't
go out with Michael

11:56.060 --> 11:57.647
because I didn't
want to upset his wife.

12:00.167 --> 12:01.479
Are you serious?

12:01.617 --> 12:03.688
I don't know!

12:03.826 --> 12:06.001
Why don't I want
Lionel around?

12:12.214 --> 12:14.388
Mrs. Jefferson. I just
went upstairs to see if...

12:14.526 --> 12:17.115
Oh, Mrs. Willis!
You're here.
What a relief.

12:17.253 --> 12:18.530
It is? Why?

12:18.668 --> 12:20.636
Because if you're here,
it means you can't be there.

12:22.155 --> 12:23.225
That's true.

12:24.364 --> 12:25.986
You see, when I gave
Mr. Willis the tickets

12:26.124 --> 12:28.230
he said he was going
to take you to the football
game on the bus.

12:28.368 --> 12:30.473
Oh. I didn't want to go.

12:30.611 --> 12:31.992
Well, thank goodness
for that.

12:32.130 --> 12:34.650
I was just listening
to the police calls
on my shortwave radio.

12:34.788 --> 12:36.721
And they said
that a charter bus
from Manhattan

12:36.859 --> 12:38.378
had crashed on the way
to the stadium.

12:38.827 --> 12:39.862
What?

12:40.000 --> 12:42.106
Yes, they said a lot
of people were badly hurt.

12:42.244 --> 12:43.417
Some of them killed,
I'm afraid.

12:43.555 --> 12:44.522
My God!

12:44.660 --> 12:45.626
So you can see
why I'm so glad

12:45.765 --> 12:47.076
you and Tom
didn't go to that game.

12:47.214 --> 12:48.215
But Tom did go.

12:48.353 --> 12:49.838
So did George.

12:49.976 --> 12:50.908
And Lionel.

12:51.909 --> 12:53.669
They could all
be on that bus.

12:59.675 --> 13:02.816
I just want to find out
if they're in the stadium.

13:04.473 --> 13:06.475
Yes, I know
that you don't,

13:06.613 --> 13:08.477
but this is a matter
of life and death.

13:09.823 --> 13:10.790
Yeah.

13:11.687 --> 13:12.792
Oh, please.

13:14.069 --> 13:15.070
Thank you.

13:15.208 --> 13:17.589
They're gonna page them.
Thank goodness.

13:17.727 --> 13:19.695
I've tried every
station on the dial

13:19.833 --> 13:22.077
and there's not
one mention
of the accident.

13:22.215 --> 13:23.423
Shall I get
my shortwave?

13:23.561 --> 13:25.321
We might hear something
more on the police calls.

13:25.459 --> 13:26.460
Would you, please?

13:26.598 --> 13:28.946
Glad to.
I'll be right back.

13:29.084 --> 13:31.327
I'll never forgive myself.
It's all my fault.

13:31.465 --> 13:33.053
Oh, how can you
say that, Louise?

13:33.191 --> 13:35.469
Because I made George
get out of the house.

13:35.607 --> 13:37.609
He didn't want to
go to that football game.

13:37.747 --> 13:39.715
He just wanted to
lie there on the couch.

13:39.853 --> 13:41.165
Now, Louise...

13:41.303 --> 13:43.719
I'd give anything to see him
lying there on that couch,

13:43.857 --> 13:46.101
stretched out peacefully.

13:46.239 --> 13:48.137
I mean, uh, sitting up!

13:48.862 --> 13:50.243
Laughing and talking.

13:52.486 --> 13:53.936
What am I doing here?

13:54.074 --> 13:55.317
Tom begged me
to go with him.

13:55.455 --> 13:57.008
I should be
out there with him.

13:57.146 --> 14:00.701
Oh, please, please,
let them be in the stadium.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.427
All right, you all come
and get some coffee.

14:03.014 --> 14:04.809
Oh, no, take it away.

14:04.947 --> 14:06.397
Who can eat
at a time like this?

14:06.535 --> 14:07.674
Now, you all listen to me.

14:07.812 --> 14:09.710
There's a cab strike
in this city, ain't it?

14:09.849 --> 14:12.748
That means there must be
a hundred buses
going to that stadium.

14:12.886 --> 14:14.612
And our men
were on one of them.

14:14.750 --> 14:16.338
Well, 99 of them
got there safe.

14:16.476 --> 14:18.305
So now just stop
being hysterical.

14:18.443 --> 14:19.928
And why don't you
have a little faith?

14:20.066 --> 14:21.481
You know He do
answer prayer.

14:26.831 --> 14:29.351
You're right.
Thank you, Florence.

14:29.489 --> 14:30.455
Yeah, yeah,
hold it, hold it.

14:30.593 --> 14:31.629
Yes?

14:34.080 --> 14:35.046
Thank you.

14:37.497 --> 14:39.050
No one answered the page.

14:40.327 --> 14:44.055
Oh, my God.
They were on that bus.

14:52.961 --> 14:54.721
You know, I really
wanted to see that game.

14:54.859 --> 14:55.791
Me too.

14:55.929 --> 14:56.930
Will you all
knock it off?

14:57.068 --> 14:58.449
It ain't my fault
we missed the bus.

14:59.691 --> 15:02.384
It sure is!
You were the one
who said he was freezing

15:02.522 --> 15:03.833
and had to have
some hot coffee.

15:03.972 --> 15:05.490
Well, you're the one that
said we had plenty of time.

15:05.905 --> 15:07.078
For coffee.

15:07.216 --> 15:08.666
But then you had
to go to the bathroom.

15:10.495 --> 15:11.841
And you took forever.

15:15.155 --> 15:16.536
Look. When I go
to the bathroom,

15:16.674 --> 15:17.951
I don't watch the clock.

15:19.919 --> 15:21.161
Come on, Pop, admit it.

15:21.299 --> 15:22.956
You wanted us
to miss that bus.

15:23.094 --> 15:25.372
Well, I'd rather be sitting
here with a cold glass

15:25.510 --> 15:27.581
than sitting in that
stadium with a cold tail.

15:30.101 --> 15:32.000
I'll have another
Coke, please.

15:32.310 --> 15:33.242
Coke.

15:33.380 --> 15:35.244
Why don't you have
a real drink?

15:35.382 --> 15:37.108
I'm respecting
Helen's wishes.

15:37.660 --> 15:38.938
You mean her orders.

15:40.491 --> 15:41.492
No such thing.

15:41.630 --> 15:42.803
It was a mutual agreement

15:42.942 --> 15:45.220
between two intelligent,
civilized people.

15:45.358 --> 15:47.084
I agreed not
to drink so much.

15:47.222 --> 15:48.223
And Helen...

15:48.948 --> 15:50.259
Agreed not to kill me.

15:52.158 --> 15:53.642
Don't laugh.

15:53.780 --> 15:55.161
When you get married,

15:55.299 --> 15:58.233
you'll find that
compromise is the only way
to settle things.

15:58.371 --> 15:59.993
Oh, don't listen
to him, Lionel.

16:00.131 --> 16:01.788
He just don't know
how to handle women.

16:03.065 --> 16:04.239
And I suppose you do?

16:04.377 --> 16:05.447
You damn right!

16:07.414 --> 16:09.969
Look, in our family,
we all know who's boss.
Right, Lionel?

16:10.107 --> 16:11.349
That's right, Mr. Willis.

16:11.487 --> 16:13.179
Whatever Mom says, goes.

16:16.768 --> 16:18.736
Well, Helen and I
have a good marriage.

16:18.874 --> 16:20.600
Give and take all the way.

16:20.738 --> 16:22.360
Yeah, you take
whatever she gives.

16:25.985 --> 16:26.916
Look.

16:27.055 --> 16:29.057
George, I am not
afraid of Helen.

16:29.195 --> 16:30.713
Prove it! Take a drink.

16:30.851 --> 16:33.130
Well, I... I don't
feel like one.

16:33.268 --> 16:34.407
Chicken.

16:36.167 --> 16:37.997
Pop, Mr. Willis just
doesn't want a drink.

16:38.135 --> 16:39.929
Now, that doesn't
mean he's scared.

16:40.068 --> 16:41.379
How do you think
he got so white?

16:41.517 --> 16:43.140
His wife
scared him into it.

16:48.421 --> 16:49.353
I'll show you.

16:49.491 --> 16:51.734
Bartender!
Three Scotches.

16:51.872 --> 16:53.426
Oh, no, thanks.
I'll stick with beer.

16:53.564 --> 16:54.841
I'm still working
on this one.

16:54.979 --> 16:56.774
I wasn't ordering
for you two.

16:56.912 --> 16:59.984
GEORGE: Uh-oh!

17:00.122 --> 17:03.470
All I want to know
is if he was on that bus.

17:03.608 --> 17:06.680
POLICE DISPATCHER OVER RADIO:
Car 27, we have a 10-30
at 75th and Madison.

17:06.818 --> 17:08.027
Please investigate.

17:08.165 --> 17:10.098
That's a robbery
in progress.

17:10.236 --> 17:12.479
But I phoned
all the hospitals.

17:12.617 --> 17:13.825
They said call the police.

17:13.963 --> 17:16.035
And now you won't tell me
anything either.

17:17.174 --> 17:18.520
But I'm his wife.

17:20.832 --> 17:22.248
Thank you for nothing.

17:24.526 --> 17:25.975
They can't give us
any information,

17:26.114 --> 17:27.080
until they get the names

17:27.218 --> 17:28.978
of all the people
on the bus.

17:29.117 --> 17:30.497
I'm going
out of my mind.

17:30.635 --> 17:32.327
When are we going
to hear some news?

17:32.465 --> 17:33.949
Well, like my daddy
used to say,

17:34.087 --> 17:36.572
"No news is good news.

17:36.710 --> 17:38.643
"Unless, of course,
you're waiting for a call
from the governor."

17:43.372 --> 17:44.994
Well, I didn't say it.
My daddy did.

17:46.203 --> 17:47.928
POLICE DISPATCHER:
We have a 10-10,
at 83rd Road

17:48.067 --> 17:49.413
and Queens Boulevard.

17:49.551 --> 17:51.587
All cars in vicinity
proceed immediately.

17:52.761 --> 17:53.762
What's a 10-10?

17:53.900 --> 17:55.729
Oh, not to worry.
It's just a murder.

17:57.662 --> 17:58.974
"Just a murder"?

17:59.768 --> 18:01.149
Oh, I didn't
mean it like that.

18:01.287 --> 18:03.254
Murder's one of
your best crimes.

18:03.392 --> 18:06.223
That is, it's one of
the bigger crimes.

18:06.361 --> 18:07.465
It's very popular.

18:08.811 --> 18:10.882
That's not
what I mean either.
I mean, uh...

18:11.020 --> 18:13.471
POLICEMAN OVER RADIO:
This is Car 93.
Where's that ambulance?

18:13.609 --> 18:15.922
This poor slob's
laying in the gutter
bleeding like a stuck pig.

18:16.060 --> 18:17.061
Oh!

18:18.821 --> 18:20.409
Mr. Bentley,
take that radio
in the kitchen.

18:20.547 --> 18:21.824
It's scaring the hell
out of everybody.

18:23.826 --> 18:25.034
But, Florence,
we want to hear...

18:25.173 --> 18:26.415
Don't worry.
We'll listen for you.

18:26.553 --> 18:28.072
If there's any news,
we'll holler.

18:30.316 --> 18:33.422
You know, Florence,
all this reminds me
of Dr. Cheswick.

18:33.560 --> 18:34.665
Who's Dr. Cheswick?

18:34.803 --> 18:36.253
He's this friend
of ours in London.

18:36.391 --> 18:38.531
And one summer, he went
on holiday to Brighton.

18:38.669 --> 18:39.946
When it was time
for him to return,

18:40.084 --> 18:41.223
he phoned his family
and told them

18:41.361 --> 18:43.570
he'd be arriving
the next morning by rail.

18:43.708 --> 18:45.952
Well, that night
they heard that the train
had been in a wreck.

18:46.090 --> 18:48.057
Oh.
They were up all night
worrying about it.

18:48.196 --> 18:49.231
But as fate
would have it,

18:49.369 --> 18:50.784
Dr. Cheswick hadn't
taken the train.

18:50.922 --> 18:52.959
He'd decided to take
the bus instead.

18:53.097 --> 18:54.857
Wasn't he lucky?

18:54.995 --> 18:57.481
Not really. It was the bus
that the train hit.

19:15.671 --> 19:17.501
Oh, I'm going to
call the police again.

19:17.639 --> 19:19.330
They must know
something by now.

19:34.552 --> 19:35.519
Oh.

19:36.692 --> 19:39.557
Oh, everything is
gonna be all right, baby.

19:39.695 --> 19:40.662
Don't cry.

19:41.904 --> 19:45.805
Oh, but I want to cry.
It makes me happy.

19:48.325 --> 19:49.809
What?

19:49.947 --> 19:51.949
I'm crying because
I'm worried about Lionel.

19:52.087 --> 19:53.951
Isn't that just fantastic?

19:54.917 --> 19:56.436
I don't understand.

19:56.574 --> 19:58.404
Well, it proves
that I love him.

19:59.612 --> 20:01.165
I guess it does.

20:01.303 --> 20:02.442
I know one thing.

20:02.580 --> 20:04.479
I'll never forget
what Lionel
looks like again.

20:06.101 --> 20:08.310
Oh, Lionel, Lionel!

20:09.415 --> 20:10.830
You must really love him.

20:11.831 --> 20:13.108
Because your daddy's
out there too

20:13.246 --> 20:14.868
and you haven't
mentioned him at all.

20:17.906 --> 20:19.459
Oh, Mom, I'm sorry.

20:19.597 --> 20:22.324
I love Daddy.
I'm worried about him too.

20:22.462 --> 20:25.258
Oh. Of course
you are, baby.

20:25.396 --> 20:26.432
I understand.

20:28.296 --> 20:31.747
Nothing. They still won't
give us any information.

20:32.265 --> 20:33.818
It's not fair.

20:33.956 --> 20:36.027
Here we are,
safe and sound,

20:36.165 --> 20:39.203
and our men could be
out there somewhere
in terrible pain.

20:44.243 --> 20:45.174
I don't know
about you guys,

20:45.313 --> 20:46.935
but I'm feeling
no pain at all.

20:48.695 --> 20:49.972
Well, Willis, you coming?

20:50.110 --> 20:51.284
No, you two go ahead.

20:51.422 --> 20:52.941
I'll wait
for Helen upstairs.

20:53.079 --> 20:54.770
Are you gonna stand up
to that woman or not?

20:54.908 --> 20:56.289
I certainly am.

20:56.427 --> 20:57.739
Good.
Open the door, Lionel.

20:59.706 --> 21:01.536
Hey, Pop!
I forgot my key.

21:01.674 --> 21:04.090
Oh, you don't need a key.
I'll break the door down.

21:10.061 --> 21:11.684
Well, that was
easier than I thought.

21:12.236 --> 21:13.202
Daddy!

21:13.341 --> 21:14.273
Tom!

21:14.411 --> 21:15.377
Lionel!

21:15.515 --> 21:16.585
Tom, you're...

21:16.723 --> 21:17.931
That's right, Helen.
I've been drinking.

21:18.069 --> 21:19.312
What do you think
of that, madam?

21:22.281 --> 21:23.972
I think it's wonderful!

21:25.732 --> 21:27.320
George! You were right!

21:27.458 --> 21:29.080
I told you I know
how to handle women.

21:29.805 --> 21:31.082
Oh, Mr. Jefferson.

21:31.220 --> 21:32.291
Ah!

21:32.429 --> 21:33.913
Oh, Lionel, I love you.

21:34.051 --> 21:36.156
I love you.
I do. I love you.

21:37.882 --> 21:39.401
Yeah, Jenny.
I already know that.

21:39.539 --> 21:41.265
No, you don't.
This is all new.

21:43.474 --> 21:44.682
Oh, yeah? Well, um...

21:44.820 --> 21:46.891
Let's go talk about it
in private, huh?

21:48.099 --> 21:49.998
Oh, Mr. Jefferson,
you know...

21:51.551 --> 21:52.897
Oh, Lionel!

21:54.209 --> 21:55.383
Oh, thank you, Lord!

21:55.521 --> 21:57.005
BENTLEY: Lionel!

21:57.143 --> 21:59.490
Oh, George,
you're all right!

21:59.628 --> 22:00.871
Mr. Willis!

22:04.392 --> 22:06.497
You know, I never thought
I'd say this, Mr. Jefferson,

22:06.635 --> 22:08.154
but I sure am glad
to see you.

22:08.982 --> 22:10.225
Mr. J, you're alive!

22:10.363 --> 22:11.571
Of course, I'm alive!

22:13.642 --> 22:16.024
Oh, Tom, I'm so glad
you weren't hurt
on that bus.

22:16.162 --> 22:17.474
What bus?

22:17.612 --> 22:18.923
The bus to the game.

22:19.061 --> 22:21.650
There was a bad accident
and we thought
you might be killed.

22:21.788 --> 22:23.203
Oh, we didn't go
to the game.

22:24.619 --> 22:25.620
You didn't?

22:25.758 --> 22:28.312
No! George made us
miss our bus.

22:28.450 --> 22:30.418
So we spent the afternoon
at Charley's Bar.

22:32.109 --> 22:33.731
You missed the bus?

22:33.869 --> 22:34.974
Yeah! Well...

22:35.112 --> 22:37.942
And you spent the afternoon
down at Charley's Bar?

22:38.080 --> 22:41.221
Yeah, but...
And you didn't call
to let us know?

22:41.981 --> 22:43.362
Stand up to her, George!

22:50.369 --> 22:52.060
You just stay
out of this.

22:52.198 --> 22:53.233
Now, listen, Weezy...

22:53.372 --> 22:55.443
We were up here
worried to death

22:55.581 --> 22:57.652
and you were
down there having fun?

22:57.790 --> 22:59.101
Go on! Tell her off!

23:01.000 --> 23:02.070
You be quiet!

23:04.590 --> 23:05.901
Look, Weezy.

23:06.039 --> 23:07.731
I didn't mean it, honest.
I'm sorry.

23:07.869 --> 23:10.216
That's telling her, George.
Show her who's boss.

23:10.354 --> 23:11.320
Tom.
What?

23:11.666 --> 23:12.632
Shut up.

23:13.702 --> 23:14.669
Yes, dear.

23:19.984 --> 23:21.676
Look, I said I was sorry!

23:21.814 --> 23:23.988
What do I have to do
to make it up to you?

23:24.126 --> 23:27.095
You and Tom will sit
there at that table

23:27.233 --> 23:28.855
and pick out
some china patterns.

23:28.993 --> 23:29.960
We'll be glad to do it.

23:30.098 --> 23:31.479
Oh, sure!
We'll help you.

23:33.204 --> 23:34.620
You are not
helping anybody.

23:34.758 --> 23:36.138
You're going to do it
all by yourselves.

23:36.276 --> 23:37.554
What?

23:37.692 --> 23:40.453
What's sauce for the goose
is sauce for the turkey.

23:40.591 --> 23:42.248
Come on, Helen.
We're going out.

23:42.973 --> 23:44.112
Where you going?

23:44.802 --> 23:46.804
Maybe to the movies.

23:46.942 --> 23:48.944
Maybe to a discotheque.

23:49.082 --> 23:52.396
Hey! Why don't you all
try that singles bar
round the corner?

23:52.534 --> 23:53.880
You might get lucky.

23:57.366 --> 23:58.540
Thank you, Florence.

23:58.678 --> 23:59.645
Hey!

23:59.783 --> 24:00.715
Hey, yourself!

24:00.853 --> 24:02.544
Now it's your turn
to worry.

24:04.788 --> 24:06.928
I say, I rather like
this pattern here.

24:07.066 --> 24:08.792
Don't you like that one?
You and your
football game!

24:08.930 --> 24:11.519
Yeah! You're the one
that started
this whole thing.

24:11.657 --> 24:12.865
Get him, George!

24:14.763 --> 24:16.040
What's that?

24:16.178 --> 24:17.386
I don't hear a thing.

24:43.447 --> 24:47.762
LOUISE: The Jeffersons was
recorded on tape in front of
a studio audience.
