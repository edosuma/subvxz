WEBVTT

00:02.335 --> 00:04.003
Bye-bye.

00:04.379 --> 00:06.505
I just got reservations
at Michelle's...

00:06.673 --> 00:08.966
...and tickets to The Music Man
to celebrate...

00:09.134 --> 00:11.677
...our first holiday
as a betrothed couple.

00:11.845 --> 00:15.055
- "Betrothed."
- Betrothed couple.

00:15.765 --> 00:17.141
- Hey.
- Hi.

00:17.308 --> 00:20.185
- Aw.
- Oh.

00:23.898 --> 00:25.065
- Pheebs?
Uh-huh?

00:25.233 --> 00:26.817
Skull?

00:26.985 --> 00:28.318
Oh. Yeah, it's my mom's.

00:28.486 --> 00:30.070
Oh, my God!

00:30.739 --> 00:32.781
No, no, no. It's not my mom.

00:32.949 --> 00:34.616
It belonged to my mom.

00:35.910 --> 00:38.287
She used to put it out
every Christmas...

00:38.455 --> 00:42.791
...to remind us that even though
it's Christmas, people still die.

00:43.668 --> 00:46.336
And you can put candy in it.

00:49.424 --> 00:50.716
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:50.884 --> 00:51.925
Licorice?

00:53.386 --> 00:55.137
Sure. Ha, ha.

00:55.346 --> 00:58.849
- I get Ben for the holidays this year.
- That's great!

00:59.017 --> 01:01.435
- Are you gonna dress up as Santa?
- Nope.

01:01.644 --> 01:03.437
I know Susan does every year.

01:03.605 --> 01:06.523
I want to take this year
to teach him about Hanukkah.

01:06.691 --> 01:08.150
And maybe I could teach Ben...

01:08.318 --> 01:11.153
...about the Christmas skull
and how people die.

01:11.654 --> 01:14.490
You may need to use this year
to teach Ben about Phoebe.

01:14.657 --> 01:15.949
Mm.

01:19.329 --> 01:20.788
Hey.

01:26.294 --> 01:28.629
- Did you know he was in there?
- No.

01:30.215 --> 01:32.883
- How long have we been home?
- About half an hour.

01:33.051 --> 01:34.343
Lovely.

02:15.218 --> 02:18.220
You know what I was thinking?
When we get married, will you, uh...

02:18.388 --> 02:20.013
...change your name to "Bing"?

02:21.057 --> 02:22.558
No.

02:23.935 --> 02:24.977
Why not?

02:26.271 --> 02:27.729
Bing's weird.

02:29.524 --> 02:30.899
Oh, hey, you guys.

02:31.067 --> 02:32.818
Hey.

02:32.986 --> 02:34.236
Guess what?

02:34.404 --> 02:37.239
My landlord just called.
My apartment's gonna be ready soon.

02:37.407 --> 02:38.782
I guess I'll be moving out.

02:38.950 --> 02:40.659
Aw, Phoebe, I'm gonna miss you.

02:40.827 --> 02:42.744
Yes, you will be very sad.

02:44.330 --> 02:48.500
- I gotta go tell Rachel the good news.
- Oh. You'll be living together again?

02:48.668 --> 02:51.378
- Why not?
- She's having so much fun with Joey...

02:51.546 --> 02:53.881
...I assumed she'd still
be living with him.

02:54.048 --> 02:56.717
Why do you think
she's having so much fun?

02:56.885 --> 02:59.219
No reason, except she...

02:59.429 --> 03:01.180
...told me.

03:01.764 --> 03:04.099
She said she didn't want
to live with me?

03:04.309 --> 03:07.019
No. No, she didn't say that.

03:07.187 --> 03:10.355
I think you should talk to Monica now.

03:11.649 --> 03:14.151
Phoebe, I'm sure
she wants to live with you.

03:14.319 --> 03:15.861
You're absolutely sure?

03:16.029 --> 03:18.530
No, but I'll bet she probably does.

03:18.698 --> 03:19.823
Oh, probably?

03:20.033 --> 03:21.325
I don't like that word.

03:23.077 --> 03:26.246
I know what "probably" really means.
Yeah, uh-huh, yeah.

03:26.456 --> 03:28.749
"Oh, your mom
probably won't kill herself."

03:28.917 --> 03:32.711
You know. I'm sorry,
but I'm not hanging my hopes...

03:32.879 --> 03:36.340
...of Rachel and I living together
on "probably."

03:36.507 --> 03:39.134
You gotta take care of yourself
in this world.

03:39.302 --> 03:41.845
History teaches us nothing.

03:43.848 --> 03:47.017
Bing doesn't seem so weird now,
does it?

03:52.273 --> 03:53.774
You're home.

03:53.942 --> 03:55.651
Guess what Phoebe got me
for Christmas?

04:04.661 --> 04:07.537
- Drums?
- No, drums!

04:13.920 --> 04:16.171
Could we get
two burritos to go, please? Ha, ha.

04:18.548 --> 04:22.219
I'm sorry. But not that sorry,
you don't have to live with it.

04:22.428 --> 04:24.888
Um, we have a reservation under Bing.

04:25.056 --> 04:28.475
Okay, we'll have a table for you
in about 45 minutes.

04:28.643 --> 04:31.645
We have tickets
to The Music Man at 8.

04:31.813 --> 04:34.648
I'm sorry.
Christmas is a very busy time, sir.

04:34.857 --> 04:37.109
Is this because of the burrito thing?

04:39.612 --> 04:42.948
- You need to give him money.
- It was a joke!

04:43.866 --> 04:46.785
To get a table. Places like this
are always shaking you down.

04:46.953 --> 04:50.455
- Everybody wants a payoff.
- All right, calm down, O'Malley.

04:52.250 --> 04:55.711
- I'll slip him some money.
- But you've got to be smooth.

04:55.878 --> 04:58.130
Hey, I can be smooth.

05:02.385 --> 05:05.387
We're in a hurry.
If you could get us a table...

05:05.555 --> 05:07.306
...a bit quicker, I'd appreciate it.

05:07.473 --> 05:09.725
- Of course, sir.
- Okay.

05:11.686 --> 05:14.646
- How'd it go?
- Had the money in the wrong hand.

05:21.946 --> 05:22.988
You don't feel...

05:23.156 --> 05:24.823
...like you're gonna throw up?
- No.

05:24.991 --> 05:27.617
Well, I do. So let's...

05:28.369 --> 05:31.330
So, Ben, you, uh...

05:31.497 --> 05:33.999
You know what holiday is coming up?

05:34.167 --> 05:35.208
Christmas.

05:35.376 --> 05:38.587
Yeah, and you know what
other holiday is coming up?

05:38.755 --> 05:40.130
Christmas Eve.

05:41.341 --> 05:44.092
Yes, but also...

05:45.470 --> 05:47.054
Hanukkah!

05:48.723 --> 05:52.059
See, you're part Jewish
and Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday.

05:52.226 --> 05:54.936
Santa has reindeers that can fly.

05:55.104 --> 05:56.563
Right, um, but on Hanukkah...

05:56.773 --> 05:59.191
Hanukkah is a celebration
of a miracle.

05:59.359 --> 06:03.070
Years and years ago there were
these people called the Maccabees.

06:03.237 --> 06:04.654
Jingle bells, jingle bells

06:04.864 --> 06:06.615
Okay, that's right. Yes...

06:06.824 --> 06:09.534
...but on Hanukkah, we sing, uh:

06:09.702 --> 06:12.579
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel
I made you out of clay

06:12.872 --> 06:15.415
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer

06:15.583 --> 06:18.251
Ha, ha. Okay, it's not a contest.

06:18.419 --> 06:20.128
When is Santa coming?

06:21.297 --> 06:24.883
How about this year,
instead of Santa...

06:25.093 --> 06:27.803
...we have fun celebrating Hanukkah?

06:27.970 --> 06:29.888
No Santa?

06:30.056 --> 06:31.681
Was I bad?

06:31.849 --> 06:35.936
No, no, no, you weren't bad.
You've been very good, Ben.

06:36.104 --> 06:39.481
- Santa's mad at me.
- No, hey, hey, come on.

06:39.649 --> 06:42.067
Ben, Santa is not mad at you, okay?

06:42.276 --> 06:44.444
You're his favorite little guy.

06:44.612 --> 06:46.113
So Santa's coming?

06:48.324 --> 06:49.908
Yes!

06:50.243 --> 06:51.785
Santa's coming.

06:56.499 --> 06:58.875
It's easy. Just keep it casual.

06:59.043 --> 07:02.587
Shake his hand and give him the money.

07:02.755 --> 07:05.882
- How do you know so much about this?
- I don't know.

07:06.426 --> 07:08.718
Richard used to do it, didn't he?

07:09.345 --> 07:11.930
We'd be eating our soup right now.

07:12.473 --> 07:15.392
Mustached bastard.

07:16.686 --> 07:20.313
Those people just left. Come on.
Quick, give him the money.

07:20.898 --> 07:21.940
Excuse me.

07:29.115 --> 07:31.408
We're in a bit of a hurry.
Can we please?

07:31.576 --> 07:33.410
Ah-ha-ha-ha.

07:47.508 --> 07:48.633
Ha!

07:50.094 --> 07:52.179
So you like the drums.

07:52.388 --> 07:54.306
That's great.

07:56.017 --> 07:58.185
I was worried that
they would create maybe...

07:58.352 --> 08:00.687
...an unbearable living situation.

08:00.855 --> 08:04.941
But, okay, well, apparently not.
So, yay!

08:05.401 --> 08:07.360
Hey, we already learned a song.

08:07.570 --> 08:10.864
Ready? One, two, three, four.

08:12.658 --> 08:14.534
Tequila!

08:16.871 --> 08:18.622
That's fun.

08:25.338 --> 08:26.505
Here you go.

08:26.672 --> 08:29.132
Thank you, Gunther.
Put her there.

08:31.677 --> 08:34.429
Definitely not easier with coins.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.097
Thank you.

08:39.769 --> 08:41.061
- Hey, Pheebs.
- Hey.

08:41.229 --> 08:44.481
Here. Now I only owe you $49.50.

08:45.775 --> 08:47.108
- Hey, Pheebs.
- Hey.

08:47.318 --> 08:51.112
If you want to get Joey a gift
that disrupts the entire building...

08:51.322 --> 08:53.406
...why not something more subtle...

08:53.616 --> 08:54.866
...like a wrecking ball...

08:55.034 --> 08:58.578
...or a vial of smallpox
to release in the hallway?

08:58.788 --> 09:01.706
It's not just the drum noise.
Every five minutes...

09:01.916 --> 09:03.750
...Joey throws his sticks
in the air...

09:03.918 --> 09:07.379
...and I have to hear:
"Oh, my eye! Oh, God, my eye!"

09:07.588 --> 09:10.173
- I mean, it's so annoying.
- Yes, thank you.

09:10.383 --> 09:14.970
You see, this is how normal people
are supposed to react to drums.

09:15.888 --> 09:19.015
You got Joey drums to annoy Rachel...

09:19.183 --> 09:21.643
...so she wouldn't want
to live there anymore?

09:22.103 --> 09:23.937
Maybe on some level.

09:32.280 --> 09:35.657
You could just not throw the sticks
up in the air.

09:35.825 --> 09:37.867
What is rock 'n' roll about that?

09:39.495 --> 09:42.914
Hey, Joey, I got you another present.

09:44.250 --> 09:46.668
Hold it!
Before you tell me what it is...

09:50.339 --> 09:51.798
Okay, what is it?

09:51.966 --> 09:53.133
It's a...

09:53.342 --> 09:54.593
...tarantula!

09:57.638 --> 09:59.014
Oh.

10:00.266 --> 10:03.977
God, Rachel, I'm sorry.
What was I thinking...

10:04.145 --> 10:07.314
...giving Joey this big, gross,
scary spider...

10:07.523 --> 10:11.234
...in such a poorly constructed cage?

10:11.736 --> 10:14.487
What are you talking about?
I love them.

10:16.365 --> 10:20.535
I had a tarantula when I was a kid.
But it died because my cat ate it.

10:20.703 --> 10:23.371
And then my cat died.

10:23.956 --> 10:25.665
But, Joey, isn't this cool?

10:25.833 --> 10:28.585
Is it on me?
I feel like it's on me. I got...

10:31.464 --> 10:33.089
Oh, isn't that adorable?

10:33.299 --> 10:36.551
- Joey is afraid of the tarantula.
- Oh.

10:36.719 --> 10:38.011
He's so adorable.

10:38.220 --> 10:39.554
He's so much fun.

10:39.722 --> 10:42.390
I'm glad you're having
so much fun here.

10:42.558 --> 10:44.059
Whoa. Wait a minute.

10:44.226 --> 10:45.268
What's the matter?

10:45.936 --> 10:47.604
Our apartment is ready.

10:48.272 --> 10:52.359
And that makes you angry because?

10:52.526 --> 10:55.153
Because you'd rather
live here with Joey.

10:55.321 --> 10:58.031
- Where did you get that?
- Monica and Chandler...

10:58.240 --> 11:00.575
...said you were having
so much fun here...

11:00.785 --> 11:05.497
...and apparently no amount of drums
or tarantulas is gonna change that.

11:07.917 --> 11:09.751
Did you get all this stuff for Joey...

11:09.919 --> 11:12.253
...to try to drive me out
of the apartment?

11:13.964 --> 11:15.924
You might as well
have gotten him a fish.

11:16.092 --> 11:18.385
You know how fish freak me out.

11:19.512 --> 11:21.221
Fish.

11:22.139 --> 11:25.350
But it wouldn't have mattered.
We're gonna live together.

11:25.559 --> 11:27.435
That's the deal.

11:27.603 --> 11:29.896
Yes, but I wanted you to want
to live with me.

11:30.106 --> 11:32.857
But if you're having
so much fun over here...

11:33.025 --> 11:35.193
Oh. It's so much more fun with you.

11:35.361 --> 11:38.154
- We did have fun, didn't we?
- We did.

11:39.281 --> 11:41.491
They say if we want,
we could see it tonight.

11:41.659 --> 11:43.785
- I would love to.
- Yay, okay!

11:43.953 --> 11:46.955
- Good, good, good.
- Great. All right. Good.

11:47.123 --> 11:49.916
And Monica asked me
to make the drumming stop.

11:50.918 --> 11:53.712
Um, ahem.

11:55.297 --> 11:56.673
Done.

12:02.722 --> 12:03.763
Hey.

12:03.931 --> 12:06.266
Hello, sir.
You here to return those pants?

12:12.606 --> 12:14.816
No, these are my pants.

12:15.234 --> 12:16.443
Oh.

12:16.610 --> 12:18.153
Okay.

12:18.654 --> 12:22.407
- How can I help you?
- Um, do you have a Santa outfit left?

12:22.575 --> 12:24.784
Two days before Christmas?
Sorry, man.

12:25.119 --> 12:28.955
Okay, look.
Do you have anything, uh, Christmas-y?

12:29.123 --> 12:32.000
I promised my son, and I really
don't want to disappoint him.

12:32.168 --> 12:36.337
Um, come on,
you gotta have something.

12:36.589 --> 12:39.507
I'm the Holiday Armadillo!

12:41.761 --> 12:43.636
I'm a friend of Santa's...

12:43.804 --> 12:46.639
...and he sent me here to wish you...

12:46.807 --> 12:50.059
...a merry Christmas!

12:50.811 --> 12:54.397
What happened to Santa,
Holiday Armadillo?

12:55.524 --> 12:57.984
Santa was unavailable...

12:58.152 --> 13:01.112
...so close to Christmas.

13:02.114 --> 13:03.656
Come in, have a seat.

13:03.824 --> 13:07.786
You must be exhausted,
coming all the way from Texas.

13:10.873 --> 13:13.208
- Texas?
- That's right, Ben.

13:13.375 --> 13:15.168
I'm Santa's representative...

13:15.377 --> 13:19.255
...for all the Southern states.

13:19.423 --> 13:22.759
And Mexico!

13:24.136 --> 13:25.720
But Santa sent me here...

13:25.930 --> 13:29.557
...to give you these presents, Ben.

13:29.767 --> 13:33.269
Maybe the lady will help me
with these presents.

13:48.494 --> 13:49.702
Wow, thanks!

13:49.912 --> 13:51.329
You're welcome, Ben.

13:51.497 --> 13:54.415
Merry Christmas. Ooh.

13:54.625 --> 13:58.211
And happy Hanukkah!

13:59.338 --> 14:02.674
Are you for Hanukkah too?
Because I'm part Jewish.

14:02.842 --> 14:06.177
You are? Me too.

14:06.887 --> 14:10.974
Because armadillos
also wandered in the desert?

14:12.893 --> 14:15.228
You want to wander in the hall?

14:16.981 --> 14:19.107
Oh. Hey, Ben!

14:19.275 --> 14:21.484
What if the Holiday Armadillo...

14:21.694 --> 14:25.280
...told you all about
the Festival of Lights?

14:25.447 --> 14:26.531
Cool!

14:26.699 --> 14:28.283
Come on, Ben.

14:31.495 --> 14:33.955
Years and years ago...

14:34.164 --> 14:36.416
...there were these people called...

14:36.625 --> 14:38.084
...the Maccabees!

14:38.252 --> 14:41.796
Ho-ho-ho. Merry Christmas!

14:43.591 --> 14:44.632
Santa!

14:44.800 --> 14:46.217
Hey.

14:47.177 --> 14:50.054
What are you doing here, Santa?

14:52.141 --> 14:54.809
Well, I'm here to see
my old buddy, Ben.

14:55.477 --> 14:57.186
What are you doing here...

14:57.396 --> 15:01.190
...Weird Turtle Man?

15:03.068 --> 15:05.945
I'm the Holiday Armadillo...

15:06.155 --> 15:09.532
...your part-Jewish friend.

15:10.993 --> 15:14.787
You sent me here
to give Ben some presents.

15:14.955 --> 15:16.873
Remember?

15:18.208 --> 15:19.250
What?

15:22.296 --> 15:24.464
Did you bring me any presents, Santa?

15:24.632 --> 15:26.341
You bet I did, Ben.

15:26.508 --> 15:28.551
Put her there.

15:32.890 --> 15:37.936
Well, it would have worked this time
if his hands weren't so damn small.

15:40.356 --> 15:43.274
Ho-ho-ho.

15:43.484 --> 15:45.109
Ben, come open more presents.

15:45.277 --> 15:48.196
Santa, the armadillo and I
will have a talk in the kitchen.

15:48.822 --> 15:51.491
There's a sentence
I never thought I'd say.

15:53.327 --> 15:54.702
What are you doing?

15:54.870 --> 15:58.122
You said you were having trouble
finding a Santa costume...

15:58.290 --> 16:00.792
...so I borrowed one
from a guy at work.

16:01.043 --> 16:03.586
Thank you, but you gotta leave.

16:03.754 --> 16:05.254
- Why?
- Because...

16:05.422 --> 16:08.132
...I'm finally getting him excited
about Hanukkah...

16:08.300 --> 16:09.842
...and you're wrecking it.

16:10.010 --> 16:14.138
But I didn't get to shake my belly
like a bowlful of jelly.

16:17.226 --> 16:21.104
I'm sorry, Chandler,
but this is really important to me.

16:22.022 --> 16:25.358
Fine, I'll give the suit back.

16:25.859 --> 16:29.529
Hey, you think you can keep it
another night?

16:31.865 --> 16:33.741
Santa, really?

16:34.368 --> 16:35.743
Yeah, is that okay?

16:36.370 --> 16:39.580
Did your dad ever dress up like Santa?

16:40.791 --> 16:44.127
- No.
- Then it's okay!

16:45.295 --> 16:47.588
Okay, Ben. Santa has to go.

16:47.756 --> 16:49.340
Say goodbye.

16:49.508 --> 16:52.176
No, why does he have to go?

16:52.344 --> 16:56.639
Because if Santa and the Holiday...

16:57.016 --> 16:58.808
...Armadillo...

17:00.894 --> 17:03.312
...are ever in the same room
for too long...

17:03.522 --> 17:06.648
...the universe will implode!

17:08.234 --> 17:10.611
Merry Christmas!

17:12.031 --> 17:15.907
No, why can't the armadillo leave?
I want Santa.

17:18.244 --> 17:19.996
Fine, I give up. Santa...

17:20.204 --> 17:22.749
Santa can stay!

17:24.667 --> 17:25.710
Well, I'll stay...

17:25.919 --> 17:29.464
...but only because I want to hear
about Hanukkah.

17:30.299 --> 17:32.800
Ben, will you sit here with Santa...

17:32.968 --> 17:35.219
...and learn about Hanukkah?

17:35.387 --> 17:37.513
Okay, Santa.

17:38.474 --> 17:40.058
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

17:40.267 --> 17:42.351
All right, it's time...

17:42.561 --> 17:45.855
...for the story of Hanukkah.

17:46.440 --> 17:48.149
Years and years ago...

17:48.317 --> 17:52.195
...there were these people
called the Maccabees!

17:52.654 --> 17:54.864
Merry Christmas!

18:04.208 --> 18:08.169
Oh, wow, look at this place!

18:10.380 --> 18:12.548
Oh, this is terrible.

18:12.716 --> 18:14.217
They've made so many changes...

18:14.384 --> 18:17.762
...I can't even feel
my grandmother's presence anymore.

18:18.305 --> 18:20.473
Oh, new sconces!

18:21.433 --> 18:23.184
- Oh, my God!
- What?

18:23.852 --> 18:27.480
Remember, uh, how you told me
your grandmother put up that wall...

18:27.689 --> 18:29.941
...to make that into two bedrooms?
- Yeah.

18:30.109 --> 18:32.401
And that the landlord
might find out...

18:32.611 --> 18:34.737
...and then tear it down?
- Yeah?

18:35.572 --> 18:38.032
Do you really not know
where I'm going?

18:39.076 --> 18:40.827
It left. It's one huge room.

18:41.036 --> 18:43.079
Oh, no!

18:45.290 --> 18:47.041
Wow!

18:48.335 --> 18:49.544
See?

18:49.711 --> 18:52.421
I guess we'll have to
put the wall back up.

18:52.589 --> 18:56.634
- You can't because of the new skylight.
- There's a skylight?

18:57.386 --> 18:58.761
Wow!

18:59.513 --> 19:03.099
Oh. So should we start looking
for a new place?

19:06.436 --> 19:07.937
You know, I'm sensing...

19:08.105 --> 19:12.191
...that, um, my grandmother
would not be comfortable with that.

19:13.694 --> 19:14.902
Oh, yeah?

19:15.112 --> 19:18.072
Starting to feel her again there,
are we?

19:18.699 --> 19:20.992
- A little bit. Yeah.
- Yeah.

19:22.119 --> 19:25.872
Is your grandmother maybe saying
that you should live here alone?

19:26.039 --> 19:28.291
You heard it too? You have the gift.

19:29.918 --> 19:31.878
Phoebe, it's okay.

19:32.045 --> 19:34.255
I like living with Joey.

19:34.423 --> 19:36.883
- Are you sure?
- Please. I hate packing...

19:37.050 --> 19:38.593
...it's closer to work.

19:38.760 --> 19:41.053
And we do have fun.

19:41.722 --> 19:45.433
Although, I'm really gonna miss
living with you.

19:45.601 --> 19:47.935
- Oh, me too.
- I know.

19:49.813 --> 19:51.689
Oh. Did you hear that?

19:51.857 --> 19:54.066
I'm getting something
from your grandmother.

19:54.234 --> 19:57.570
She said since you get to keep
the one-bedroom apartment...

19:57.738 --> 20:01.282
...you should give Rachel
the purple chair.

20:03.577 --> 20:05.953
No, I do not hear that.

20:07.372 --> 20:10.625
And the miracle was that
that little bit of oil...

20:10.792 --> 20:14.670
...that should have lasted
just one day, burned for...

20:14.838 --> 20:16.797
- Eight whole days.
- That's right.

20:16.965 --> 20:20.843
And that's why we celebrate
Hanukkah today. The end.

20:21.011 --> 20:23.054
- Awesome.
- Yeah.

20:23.430 --> 20:24.472
My favorite part...

20:24.681 --> 20:29.268
...was when Superman
flew all the Jews out of Egypt.

20:33.023 --> 20:37.944
The armadillo was actually
not so thrilled about that part.

20:38.362 --> 20:41.072
Okay, Ben, it's time to light...

20:41.240 --> 20:44.408
...the Hanukkah candles!

20:44.576 --> 20:46.202
Ho-ho-ho.

20:53.210 --> 20:54.252
Hey.

20:54.419 --> 20:55.795
- Oh.
- Wow.

20:55.963 --> 20:58.422
Looks like the Easter Bunny's
funeral in here.

21:01.551 --> 21:03.886
Come on, come on.
We're lighting the candles.

21:04.054 --> 21:05.638
Oh, oh.

21:09.184 --> 21:10.935
I understand why Superman is here...

21:11.103 --> 21:14.939
...but why is there a porcupine
at the Easter Bunny's funeral?

21:23.156 --> 21:25.658
- You get it?
- I got it.

21:25.826 --> 21:27.702
Back in the cage?

21:28.787 --> 21:30.913
It's back in the cage.

21:31.081 --> 21:32.957
Is the cage closed?

21:34.668 --> 21:37.920
Joey, will you just come out here
and stop being such a baby?
