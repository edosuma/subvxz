00:53.880 --> 00:55.999
Go get them, Petey!

01:13.680 --> 01:16.042
Petey! What's up, pup?

01:20.440 --> 01:22.881
Get it, Stymie, get it!

01:24.920 --> 01:28.522
- Hey, man, where's your mitt?
- Don't worry about it.

01:29.720 --> 01:31.729
All right! Good catch!

01:55.520 --> 01:57.563
Hello, Petey.

02:12.040 --> 02:13.890
Be back later, Mom.

02:39.760 --> 02:43.799
- Got anything, Porky?
- Not a bite, Buckwheat.

02:43.800 --> 02:45.240
Hmm.

02:52.760 --> 02:57.599
- I got something! I got something!
- Me too! A big fat one!

03:03.120 --> 03:05.129
Whoa!

03:12.040 --> 03:14.129
Whoa!

03:14.200 --> 03:16.919
Whoa!

03:16.920 --> 03:19.282
Yo, Petey, come here!

03:22.600 --> 03:25.531
- Thanks, Petey!
- Whoa!

03:28.560 --> 03:31.650
Hey Porky, look! A note.

03:33.120 --> 03:34.845
What's it say?

03:39.120 --> 03:41.163
We got to learn to read.

04:06.880 --> 04:08.159
You okay?

04:08.160 --> 04:10.519
You're okay.
You're all right.

04:10.520 --> 04:13.279
Go on in. You're okay.

04:13.280 --> 04:16.918
Go on in.
What's the "Hi" sign?

04:16.920 --> 04:19.327
Go on in.

04:19.519 --> 04:23.441
You're okay.
Wrong sign, Porky.

04:23.640 --> 04:25.205
Okay, go on in.

04:25.720 --> 04:27.763
You're okay, Elmer.

04:33.280 --> 04:35.562
You little creep.

04:46.360 --> 04:47.719
Sit down.

04:47.720 --> 04:51.759
Gentlemen and gentlemen, I give
you our president, Spanky.

04:51.760 --> 04:53.159
Hi, Spanky!

04:55.200 --> 04:57.767
How's it going, Spanky?

04:58.040 --> 04:59.759
Nice to see ya, Spanky.

04:59.760 --> 05:03.123
- Hey, Spanky, what's up?
- How are ya?

05:03.240 --> 05:05.329
Good to see ya.

05:05.760 --> 05:07.799
Your fly's undone.

05:07.800 --> 05:11.559
- Welcome!
- All right, Spanky!

05:11.560 --> 05:16.971
- Hey, Spanky!
- All raise your right hand.

05:18.280 --> 05:20.130
Your other right hand.

05:22.920 --> 05:24.959
- I...
- I...

05:24.960 --> 05:27.559
- Stymie...
- Stymie...

05:27.560 --> 05:30.999
member in good standing of the
He-Man Woman-Haters Club...

05:31.000 --> 05:35.719
member in good standing of the
He-Man Woman-Haters Club...

05:35.720 --> 05:38.879
do solemnly swear to be a He-Man and
hate women and not play with them,

05:38.880 --> 05:43.559
or talk to them unless I have to,
and especially never fall in love.

05:43.560 --> 05:46.959
And if I do, may I die slowly and
painfully and suffer for hours,

05:46.960 --> 05:49.439
or until I scream bloody murder.

05:52.800 --> 05:57.439
do solemnly swear to be a He-Man...

05:59.200 --> 06:04.770
- You thinkin' what I'm thinkin', Woim?
- Yeah, Butch.

06:06.120 --> 06:07.845
What are we thinkin'?

06:08.600 --> 06:13.010
How much fun it's gonna be to
stomp those guys in the race.

06:14.040 --> 06:17.562
Painfully, and suffer for hours,

06:18.080 --> 06:20.681
bloody murder!

06:21.520 --> 06:25.079
- Ready to take down the minutes, Uh-Huh?
- Uh-huh.

06:25.080 --> 06:29.879
As you know, today I called
an emergency meeting,

06:29.880 --> 06:31.799
for a very important reason.

06:31.800 --> 06:34.799
But first, any good stories?

06:34.800 --> 06:36.639
- Me!
- Buckwheat.

06:36.640 --> 06:40.079
Yeah! This morning my sister
left the toilet seat down.

06:41.200 --> 06:44.319
- Women make men miserable.
- Froggy.

06:44.320 --> 06:48.241
Yeah, there's this girl who
moved in across the street,

06:48.400 --> 06:50.839
and she came over 'cause
she wanted to play.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.559
- But don't worry, I got back at her.
- What'd you do?

06:55.560 --> 06:59.199
- What'd you do?
- I whipped out my lizard.

06:59.200 --> 07:01.559
Humph!

07:01.560 --> 07:04.199
Yeah!

07:04.200 --> 07:06.528
Good job, Frogman.

07:06.560 --> 07:09.879
- Are you gettin' this, Uh-Huh?
- Uh-huh.

07:09.880 --> 07:13.639
All right, men, let's talk
about the pride of our club,

07:13.640 --> 07:14.959
the Blur.

07:14.960 --> 07:17.519
The Blur has never been beaten,

07:17.520 --> 07:21.691
since the beginning of time,
five years.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.399
This Sunday, we defend our honor,

07:24.400 --> 07:27.444
- our undefeated streak and our trophy.
- Yeah.

07:27.720 --> 07:30.159
Best of all, this year's trophy,

07:30.160 --> 07:33.879
will be presented by
none other than the famous,

07:33.880 --> 07:36.082
Indy race car driver,

07:36.440 --> 07:39.639
A.J. Ferguson.

07:39.640 --> 07:42.919
Wow! He's the best driver
in the whole world!

07:42.920 --> 07:46.199
- Men, can I have an "Azuga"?
- Azuga!

07:46.200 --> 07:49.119
Azuga! Azuga! Azuga! Azuga!

07:49.120 --> 07:52.719
- Hey, nice Azugas.
- Yeah.

07:52.720 --> 07:55.879
And now the reason
for the emergency meeting,

07:55.880 --> 07:59.239
the choosing of the driver!

07:59.240 --> 08:02.199
Yeah!

08:02.200 --> 08:05.359
Our driver should be
a man who's all He-Man.

08:05.360 --> 08:07.879
A He-Man so manly,

08:07.880 --> 08:09.559
that if he fell off a building,

08:09.560 --> 08:11.999
he'd go out of his way
to land on a girl.

08:13.840 --> 08:16.079
Gentlemen, this year,

08:16.080 --> 08:18.839
our driver's name is,

08:18.840 --> 08:21.959
none other than my lifelong chum,

08:21.960 --> 08:24.759
my best buddy
in the whole wide world,

08:24.760 --> 08:28.123
the one and only Alfalfa!

08:28.160 --> 08:31.284
- Yeah!
- Otay!

08:32.880 --> 08:37.130
Say, where the heck is Alfalfa?

08:45.120 --> 08:49.879
You are so beautiful

08:49.880 --> 08:52.119
to me

08:52.120 --> 08:56.959
Can't you see

08:56.960 --> 09:00.960
You're everything I hoped for

09:02.520 --> 09:07.319
You're everything I need

09:07.320 --> 09:12.599
You are so beautiful

09:12.600 --> 09:16.691
to me

09:16.880 --> 09:18.959
There he is, you guys! Come on!

09:18.960 --> 09:20.239
He's with a girl.

09:20.240 --> 09:22.039
Quiet, Petey.

09:22.040 --> 09:25.369
- They're together.
- Oh, no!

09:25.480 --> 09:27.762
This is awful.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.363
Buckwheat, hand me
your fishin' pole.

09:31.840 --> 09:36.919
Oh, Darla, we're two hearts
with but one beat.

09:36.920 --> 09:40.319
Two brains with but one thought.

09:40.320 --> 09:43.364
Two souls with but one...

09:44.920 --> 09:46.759
shoe.

09:46.760 --> 09:50.519
Then how can you belong to
that silly Woman Haters Club?

09:50.520 --> 09:54.008
You know, I'm a woman.

09:54.280 --> 09:58.239
- Sort of.
- Let me tell you something, Darla.

09:58.240 --> 10:00.799
I'm not like those guys.

10:00.800 --> 10:02.999
I'm a sensitive male.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.639
I'm into sharing, caring,

10:05.640 --> 10:07.719
feeling and healing.

10:07.720 --> 10:11.399
- I'm in touch with my feminine side.
- How nice.

10:11.400 --> 10:13.479
It's worse than I thought.

10:13.480 --> 10:17.039
You know Alfalfa, the big talent
show at the fair is coming up,

10:17.040 --> 10:20.959
and I was sort of wondering if
maybe you'd like to sing with me.

10:20.960 --> 10:23.799
You mean it? I'd be honored.

10:23.800 --> 10:28.159
Hey, I've got an idea. Let me
take you on a picnic tomorrow.

10:28.160 --> 10:31.919
- Excuse me?
- The way you feed my soul,

10:31.920 --> 10:33.849
I can...

10:34.400 --> 10:36.079
feed your face.

10:36.080 --> 10:39.679
Cool! And to prove
you're proud of me,

10:39.680 --> 10:43.601
why don't we have our
picnic in your clubhouse?

10:43.840 --> 10:45.326
No!

10:46.240 --> 10:49.519
Tomorrow? Tomorrow?

10:49.520 --> 10:52.519
Swimming day. Sure!

10:52.520 --> 10:57.199
Oh, Alfalfa, you're a sweetie poo!

11:11.480 --> 11:15.685
- All right, Woim, ready for the test run?
- Ready, Butch!

11:22.360 --> 11:24.847
Look! There goes our bumper!

11:29.120 --> 11:31.482
All this work for nothing.

11:40.960 --> 11:43.359
Everything's working out perfectly.

11:43.360 --> 11:45.439
The guys are at the swimming hole,

11:45.440 --> 11:47.319
and I'm at home with a toothache.

11:47.320 --> 11:49.679
Nothing can possibly go wrong.

11:53.280 --> 11:55.159
- Hiya, Butch.
- Shut up!

11:55.160 --> 11:58.125
When's the last time
we beat you up?

11:58.160 --> 12:01.239
Let's see. Today's the 10th.

12:01.240 --> 12:05.919
Thirty days has September,
April, June and November.

12:05.920 --> 12:08.487
It's not a leap year.

12:09.920 --> 12:12.805
- Yesterday.
- You're due!

12:12.840 --> 12:14.405
Look!

12:15.520 --> 12:19.611
- I don't see nothing!
- Come on, you doink!

12:19.640 --> 12:22.479
Let's go! He can't run very fast.

12:22.480 --> 12:25.319
- Come back here, you ugly little squid!
- No!

12:25.320 --> 12:28.569
Oh! Oh! Oh!

12:29.320 --> 12:33.320
Oh! Whoa! Whoa!

12:34.360 --> 12:36.005
Whoa!

12:50.760 --> 12:53.042
I've come a-courtin'.

12:53.720 --> 12:55.604
These are for you.

13:01.840 --> 13:03.246
Fifi!

13:07.120 --> 13:08.924
Good doggie.

13:09.840 --> 13:14.090
I hope Fifi didn't startle
you, she's so playful.

13:15.520 --> 13:18.039
Forgive my effrontery,

13:18.040 --> 13:22.839
but you, miss, are a rare rose
in a garden of weeds.

13:22.840 --> 13:27.599
You have the sophistication
of a woman of 12.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.886
My name is Waldo Aloysius Johnston III

13:33.080 --> 13:36.762
- I'm Alfalfa!
- Yes, I'm sure you are.

13:37.160 --> 13:40.839
- And I'm Darla.
- We just moved into town.

13:40.840 --> 13:43.279
My father bought the oil refinery.

13:43.280 --> 13:48.559
- That explains why you're so refined.
- Yeah, and so oily!

13:48.560 --> 13:50.922
Watch it, bud.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.399
I hope to see you again soon.

13:54.400 --> 13:58.479
That could be arranged. I'll be
appearing in the talent show coming up.

13:58.480 --> 14:00.599
Yeah, the two of us,

14:00.600 --> 14:03.839
we'll both be singing
a duet, together.

14:03.840 --> 14:07.123
- How redundant.
- Thank you.

14:07.200 --> 14:09.562
Well, I shall be going now.

14:12.520 --> 14:14.006
Whoa!

14:16.560 --> 14:18.489
What a hunk!

14:18.840 --> 14:22.119
He's smoother than a baby's bottom.

14:22.120 --> 14:25.483
And he smells better too!

14:40.000 --> 14:43.170
Oh, you're so nice
for bringing me here.

14:55.120 --> 14:58.244
- I can't see, I can't see.
- Move over.

15:01.400 --> 15:05.446
A candlelit lunch! I'm dazzled.

15:17.400 --> 15:18.886
Excuse me.

15:21.480 --> 15:24.889
I seem to have a little fahrvergnugen.

15:25.040 --> 15:27.208
No problem.

15:28.040 --> 15:31.608
- Grape soda?
- Yes, please.

15:39.120 --> 15:40.731
To us.

15:50.000 --> 15:53.439
This tastes like somebody
poured it through a old boot.

15:53.440 --> 15:55.165
Actually, it's a sneaker.

15:58.640 --> 16:00.922
Must have been a bad year.

16:05.200 --> 16:08.210
Maybe we should
strap on the old feed bag.

16:08.520 --> 16:11.485
- Which sandwich did I bring?
- This one.

16:11.520 --> 16:15.039
Why don't we swap?
What's yours is mine,

16:15.040 --> 16:16.999
what's mine is ours.

16:17.000 --> 16:20.966
You know just what to say
to take a girl's breath away.

16:21.880 --> 16:23.969
This'll take her breath away.

16:32.440 --> 16:35.559
Porky, you sure know
how to make a "sand... wich."

16:35.560 --> 16:37.999
That wasn't sand,
that was kitty litter.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.719
Don't worry, it's pretty fresh.

16:46.080 --> 16:50.808
- You made a delicious sandwich.
- So did you.

16:51.840 --> 16:53.724
Very crunchy.

16:55.280 --> 16:58.962
Maybe we should move on to dessert.

17:04.640 --> 17:06.604
It's a surprise.

17:08.720 --> 17:10.999
It's beautiful!

17:11.000 --> 17:14.646
I had to eat six boxes
of Cracker Jacks to find it.

17:14.960 --> 17:18.686
It's a symbol of
my undying affliction for you.

17:19.440 --> 17:22.007
I love diamonds!

17:37.080 --> 17:39.959
I was wrong about you, Alfalfa.

17:39.960 --> 17:43.084
You're not embarrassed
by the woman you love.

17:43.640 --> 17:45.159
Darla,

17:45.160 --> 17:49.206
would you think me forward
if I asked you for a...

17:51.000 --> 17:52.359
a big wet one?

17:52.360 --> 17:55.131
- What?
- A kiss?

17:55.200 --> 17:57.084
Okay.

18:02.160 --> 18:04.719
Oh, man! Gross!

18:04.720 --> 18:08.839
I can't take it anymore.
Get outta there!

18:08.840 --> 18:10.519
Open up!

18:10.520 --> 18:14.520
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Why, thank you, Alfalfa.

18:18.920 --> 18:20.690
Open up!

18:20.840 --> 18:23.359
In my hurry to eat,
I forgot to give you the tour.

18:23.360 --> 18:27.121
Here's the wall,
here's the other wall and...

18:27.680 --> 18:29.279
here's our closet.

18:29.280 --> 18:32.519
- Have you lost your mind?
- Do you wanna go in there?

18:32.520 --> 18:36.679
- Just as I thought, you are ashamed of me.
- I'm not ashamed of you.

18:36.680 --> 18:38.319
- I'm proud of you.
- Open up!

18:38.320 --> 18:40.719
I just don't want anybody
to see you.

18:40.720 --> 18:44.639
- Well, that does it, mister. I'm out of here!
- One, two,

18:44.640 --> 18:46.251
three!

18:48.840 --> 18:50.119
It's about time.

18:50.120 --> 18:53.479
Hiya, guys! You're back early.

18:53.480 --> 18:55.719
How's the toothache, bub?

18:55.720 --> 18:59.119
- Yeah!
- Dentist pulled my wisdom teeth.

18:59.120 --> 19:02.449
So that explains why
you're acting so stupid.

19:02.880 --> 19:04.799
Well, we're going
inside the clubhouse...

19:04.800 --> 19:07.919
No, you're not! It's such a
nice day outside, isn't it?

19:07.920 --> 19:10.282
Nothing's going on in there.

19:11.960 --> 19:15.767
- Hey, what's that noise?
- Whoa!

19:20.960 --> 19:22.241
Darla!

19:25.960 --> 19:29.919
- What's the matter?
- Fire! Fire!

19:29.920 --> 19:33.408
- You two, call the fire department.
- Yes, sir!

19:44.600 --> 19:48.566
Ready, fire!

19:50.760 --> 19:54.199
We're gonna need some more help.
Get more people.

19:54.200 --> 19:55.640
Fire!

20:08.320 --> 20:10.443
Put some more in the bucket.

20:26.600 --> 20:30.279
Quick! What's the number for 911?

20:30.280 --> 20:32.005
How do I know?

20:33.920 --> 20:35.279
Let's go!

20:35.280 --> 20:38.723
If you'd like to make a call,
please hang up and try again.

20:50.160 --> 20:52.799
Here's the hose.
Turn it on when I tell you.

20:57.480 --> 20:59.921
Spanky, over here!

21:03.280 --> 21:05.599
Go! Go! Go!

21:05.600 --> 21:09.600
Go! Faster! Go even faster!

21:12.360 --> 21:14.608
Wow! That is fast.

21:17.080 --> 21:19.442
Hey, beat it, pal!

21:21.120 --> 21:23.721
Stymie, let 'er rip!

21:26.480 --> 21:28.999
Whoa!

21:29.000 --> 21:31.959
- Wow!
- Whoa!

21:31.960 --> 21:34.925
Whoa!

21:36.680 --> 21:38.609
Whoa!

21:53.280 --> 21:56.927
I'm never going to speak
to you as long as I live.

21:57.240 --> 22:00.205
Tell him when he comes to, guys.

22:02.320 --> 22:05.967
Goodbye! Excuse me!

22:07.920 --> 22:11.119
Hi, Darla. I thought that was you.

22:11.120 --> 22:13.399
- Bye!
- How about a ride in my father's Bentley?

22:13.400 --> 22:16.159
And then, over a Belgian croissant,

22:16.160 --> 22:19.279
we might talk about performing
in the talent show together.

22:19.280 --> 22:22.799
Sounds great!
I had a hard day.

22:22.800 --> 22:25.279
The clubhouse is fried crispy.

22:25.280 --> 22:27.599
Our lives are over.

22:27.600 --> 22:29.882
And it's all your fault!

22:32.720 --> 22:35.161
- That's right.
- It sure is.

22:41.040 --> 22:44.403
All rise for Judge Spanky.

22:47.120 --> 22:50.081
- I think Spanky's going to find him guilty.
- Big time.

22:52.280 --> 22:55.802
- How do you plead?
- Like this.

22:56.880 --> 23:00.239
Please, oh, please,
have mercy, please!

23:00.240 --> 23:04.240
Hmm! Pretty good pleading.

23:04.360 --> 23:07.848
Would you like to make a statement?

23:09.920 --> 23:11.531
Just that,

23:11.600 --> 23:15.691
I never knew likin' a girl
could lead to all this.

23:16.240 --> 23:19.719
I let my pals down,
I let the club down,

23:19.720 --> 23:22.321
and I let my best friend down.

23:24.360 --> 23:27.759
Alfalfa Switzer,
I hereby sentence you

23:27.760 --> 23:31.159
to execution... at dawn!

23:31.160 --> 23:33.488
- Yes!
- Uh-huh!

23:35.680 --> 23:40.442
Your Honor, may I suggest, this
court rules he be put on probation.

23:40.520 --> 23:42.519
As terms of the probation,

23:42.520 --> 23:45.769
he alone will be responsible
for guarding the go-cart.

23:46.240 --> 23:48.283
Day and night.

23:49.960 --> 23:52.359
- Court agrees.
- Yeah.

23:52.360 --> 23:55.239
Do you mean you want me
to spend the night here?

23:55.240 --> 23:58.079
All alone? Out in the open?

23:58.080 --> 24:00.039
What about the wild dingoes?

24:00.040 --> 24:01.599
- Too bad.
- Deal with it.

24:01.600 --> 24:03.679
As another term of his probation,

24:03.680 --> 24:09.250
that he may never again talk to, see
or even think about Darla, or else...

24:10.520 --> 24:12.165
Yeah!

24:12.880 --> 24:17.847
And I'm makin' it my own personal
business to see that you don't.

24:18.040 --> 24:20.049
Yeah! All right!

24:24.040 --> 24:26.163
Oh!

24:35.160 --> 24:37.679
You are so beautiful to me.

24:37.680 --> 24:40.079
I love you, Alfalfa.

24:40.080 --> 24:42.639
I want to die in your arms.

24:42.640 --> 24:45.759
- You do?
- Of course, not right away.

24:45.760 --> 24:49.039
- March! March!
- I'm off to join Sir Spankus.

24:49.040 --> 24:51.799
How's the toothache, bub?

24:51.800 --> 24:55.559
But you're my boy-toy!
I won't let you go!

24:55.560 --> 24:57.569
You must choose between us.

24:58.120 --> 25:02.759
- Yeah, you must choose between us.
- Sir Alfalfa, haul butt!

25:02.760 --> 25:05.440
Maybe this will help you
make up your mind.

25:18.200 --> 25:21.439
- Tell me you'll never leave me.
- I'll never leave you.

25:21.440 --> 25:27.319
That's it, traitor! We must slay
you before your forbidden love

25:27.320 --> 25:30.649
destroys our manly bond.

25:31.360 --> 25:34.199
Choose or die! Choose or die!

25:34.200 --> 25:39.400
Choose or die! Choose or die!

26:02.320 --> 26:04.719
Ease up, pal. It's just us.

26:04.720 --> 26:07.159
- We came to keep you company.
- Yeah.

26:07.160 --> 26:08.399
Yeah.

26:08.400 --> 26:11.285
Well, why am I soaking wet?

26:11.480 --> 26:15.319
Don't worry, Alfalfa. I used
to have the same problem.

26:16.640 --> 26:19.923
There's just a hole in the tent.

26:30.960 --> 26:33.519
You're not thinking
about Darla, are ya?

26:33.520 --> 26:36.200
- No, of course not.
- Good!

26:36.440 --> 26:39.564
I wonder if she's
not thinking of me too.

26:39.760 --> 26:41.849
Why are boys such jerks?

26:42.800 --> 26:46.559
You're not thinking
about Alfalfa, are you?

26:46.560 --> 26:49.809
Oh, no, no, no, no way!

26:49.920 --> 26:52.248
Are you sure?

26:54.240 --> 26:56.399
Babes are like a bad song.

26:56.400 --> 26:59.719
Once you get them stuck in your
head, you can't get them out again.

26:59.720 --> 27:01.239
Yeah, that's right.

27:05.040 --> 27:08.359
- Why do they have to be so...
- Different?

27:09.520 --> 27:11.399
Girls get along with each other.

27:11.400 --> 27:13.519
Boys stand up for themselves.

27:13.520 --> 27:17.199
- Girls care.
- Boys take what's theirs.

27:17.200 --> 27:19.359
Boys won't listen.

27:19.360 --> 27:21.599
All they wanna do is talk.

27:21.600 --> 27:25.407
- They like to moon ya.
- No, we don't!

27:30.800 --> 27:34.719
- Gigglin' and gossipin'.
- Fighting and farting!

27:34.720 --> 27:38.159
- Barbie's and bracelets.
- Boogers and bugs!

27:38.160 --> 27:40.439
- Ice skating.
- Bungee jumping.

27:40.440 --> 27:42.759
Synchronized swimming.

27:44.760 --> 27:47.319
And try to get 'em to sit still.

27:47.320 --> 27:48.879
Boys...

27:50.480 --> 27:51.919
Girls...

27:53.320 --> 27:55.039
And the worst thing of all...

27:55.040 --> 27:58.599
- They smell...
- Weird!

28:12.440 --> 28:14.165
Howdy, mister.

28:16.440 --> 28:19.599
Me and my buddies
have to build a new clubhouse.

28:19.600 --> 28:21.643
We need to buy some lumber.

28:22.400 --> 28:24.125
- What kind?
- Wood!

28:24.440 --> 28:26.369
We took up a collection.

28:28.280 --> 28:31.324
Get us all the wood you can
for this much, please.

28:43.680 --> 28:45.689
Paper or plastic?

28:51.400 --> 28:55.039
$450 for lumber?

28:55.040 --> 28:57.720
Where are we gonna get
that kind of moola?

28:57.760 --> 29:01.199
I don't know. You know what they say,

29:01.200 --> 29:04.927
wood doesn't grow on trees.

29:06.040 --> 29:07.765
Hey, you guys, come here!

29:12.080 --> 29:15.439
All in favor say,
"Yoy, yoy, yoy, yoy, yoy!"

29:15.440 --> 29:18.166
Yoy, yoy, yoy, yoy...

29:19.000 --> 29:20.884
Thank you, my good man.

29:31.880 --> 29:36.479
Six kids, hardworking father,
honest and trustworthy.

29:36.480 --> 29:39.411
Loan denied.

29:41.240 --> 29:43.199
Hello, my good man.

29:43.200 --> 29:45.846
Gentlemen, have a seat.

29:47.320 --> 29:50.490
- Can we sit down?
- Are you kidding?

29:50.960 --> 29:53.039
We can't sit down, my good man.

29:53.040 --> 29:56.919
- What may I do for you?
- We want to take out a hefty loan.

29:56.920 --> 29:59.239
Of course, of course. Do you
have an account with us?

29:59.240 --> 30:00.719
And how!

30:00.720 --> 30:02.763
And what is your account...

30:04.200 --> 30:07.563
- number?
- Seven.

30:08.360 --> 30:09.766
Seven?

30:10.800 --> 30:12.809
Seven...?

30:13.960 --> 30:17.084
- Try eight?
- Eight?

30:18.520 --> 30:20.370
Heard enough.

30:22.360 --> 30:23.719
Ouch!

30:23.720 --> 30:26.919
If you were my kids,
I'd punish you!

30:26.920 --> 30:30.522
If we were your kids,
we'd punish ourselves!

30:31.240 --> 30:33.319
Leave the premises posthaste!

30:33.320 --> 30:36.683
You can't treat people
this way, mister.

30:36.880 --> 30:39.970
You're not people.
You're kids.

30:48.360 --> 30:51.803
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

30:55.560 --> 30:59.319
She loves me.
She loves me not.

30:59.320 --> 31:03.286
She loves me.
She loves me not.

31:03.480 --> 31:05.679
She loves me!

31:05.680 --> 31:08.599
You guys don't know
what you're talking about.

31:08.600 --> 31:10.882
I have to see her!

31:11.360 --> 31:14.643
But that's a violation
of your probation.

31:17.200 --> 31:21.799
I know! I'll write a message,
and you two can take it to her.

31:21.800 --> 31:24.479
Wait a second!
We're He-Man Woman Haters.

31:24.480 --> 31:26.519
We can't deliver love notes.

31:26.520 --> 31:30.319
Love note? No!
This is gonna be a hate note.

31:30.320 --> 31:32.921
- Sounds good to me!
- Sounds good to me!

31:36.200 --> 31:41.008
Dear Darla,
I hate your stinkin' guts!

31:42.160 --> 31:44.479
You make me vomit.

31:45.640 --> 31:49.765
You're scum between my toes.

31:50.160 --> 31:52.647
Love, Alfalfa.

31:53.880 --> 31:56.128
Otay!

31:57.040 --> 31:58.730
What's up, guys?

32:00.720 --> 32:02.763
Buckwheat, where's the note?

32:02.800 --> 32:04.650
Note, note.

32:05.880 --> 32:08.082
I know I got it here somewhere.

32:08.320 --> 32:11.763
- Come on, guys.
- We'll find it.

32:16.040 --> 32:18.242
I'm waiting.

32:25.520 --> 32:28.485
I know! I gave it to you.

32:29.320 --> 32:31.568
Uh-oh!

32:31.960 --> 32:33.999
- What's going on?
- Sorry.

32:34.000 --> 32:37.807
It's otay. I remember what it said.

32:38.480 --> 32:40.679
"Dear Darla,

32:40.680 --> 32:43.199
"I hate your stinking guts.

32:44.320 --> 32:46.124
"You make me vomit.

32:46.840 --> 32:49.679
"You are scum between my toes.

32:49.680 --> 32:52.679
"Love, Alfalfa."

32:57.440 --> 32:59.722
Whoa!

33:00.160 --> 33:03.364
Well, yeah... but was she upset?

33:03.560 --> 33:06.411
Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm.
Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm.

33:07.440 --> 33:10.999
Oh! I have to go to her house
and explain what happened.

33:11.000 --> 33:12.804
Forget it, pal!

33:12.920 --> 33:17.639
Number one, she's not home
'cause she has a ballet recital.

33:17.640 --> 33:20.844
Number two...
What was number two?

33:23.160 --> 33:28.127
No! Not that!
The other number two.

33:28.680 --> 33:30.919
Spanky said
you couldn't talk to her.

33:30.920 --> 33:35.170
What? I can talk
to Darla any time I want.

33:35.880 --> 33:38.481
Spanky's not the boss of me!

33:39.160 --> 33:41.408
Hiya, pal!

33:43.600 --> 33:45.802
Oh, no!

33:54.640 --> 33:57.119
Trust me, this is
for your own good.

33:57.120 --> 34:00.239
After you dump her,
you'll feel like a new man.

34:00.240 --> 34:03.842
But, I like the feel
of the old man.

34:04.040 --> 34:07.079
Hello. Hello, enjoy the show.

34:07.080 --> 34:08.319
Who are you with?

34:08.320 --> 34:13.003
I'm with him,
and we need to talk to Darla.

34:13.360 --> 34:16.159
I'm afraid that's out of the
question, she's about to go onstage.

34:16.159 --> 34:18.998
Now clear the door. Go on.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.998
Too bad. Well, let's go!

34:22.000 --> 34:26.489
Hold it, partner. We're waiting
right here till Darla comes out.

34:26.840 --> 34:28.804
Oh, man!

34:36.960 --> 34:38.119
Whoops!

34:46.760 --> 34:49.770
This'll be like stealing candy
from a baby.

34:49.880 --> 34:52.599
Oh, boy.

34:52.600 --> 34:54.404
Come on.

35:06.200 --> 35:08.368
Hey, look! A dollar!

35:12.200 --> 35:13.439
Ducky, ducky!

35:13.440 --> 35:16.839
Yoo-hoo, Mister Ducky,
ducky! Ducky!

35:16.840 --> 35:19.599
Ducky! Ducky, ducky!

35:19.600 --> 35:21.719
Ducky! Come here, ducky!

35:21.720 --> 35:25.039
- Ducky!
- Nothing beats a buck and a duck.

35:25.040 --> 35:28.323
Hey, you dumb duck, wait up!

35:29.320 --> 35:33.445
What's this?

35:43.480 --> 35:46.319
We got a dollar, we got a dollar

35:46.320 --> 35:48.799
We got a dollar.
Hey, hey, hey, hey

35:48.800 --> 35:51.359
We got a dollar, we got a dollar

35:51.360 --> 35:54.245
We got a dollar.
Hey, hey, hey, hey

35:56.040 --> 35:57.685
I'm bored.

35:58.760 --> 36:00.279
Ta-da!

36:00.280 --> 36:02.323
Gee, thanks!

36:05.960 --> 36:09.879
Butch and Woim! Put that thing
in your pocket and let's bail!

36:09.880 --> 36:12.560
Hey, there they are.

36:16.000 --> 36:17.611
Whoops!

36:18.680 --> 36:20.086
Whoops!

36:21.560 --> 36:23.285
Let's go!

36:26.440 --> 36:27.926
Whoops!

36:28.960 --> 36:30.446
Whoops!

36:30.600 --> 36:32.165
Shh...

36:34.040 --> 36:36.199
Hiya, big boys!

36:36.200 --> 36:37.839
Woof, woof!

36:37.840 --> 36:40.279
- Ditto!
- Say,

36:40.280 --> 36:44.279
you two chicklets see a couple
of ugly mugs who ran in here?

36:44.280 --> 36:46.919
You mean, besides you?

36:46.920 --> 36:49.487
I think they went in there.

36:51.360 --> 36:53.719
Thanks, doll face.

36:53.720 --> 36:55.251
Bye.

36:58.880 --> 37:01.159
One, two, three!

37:02.880 --> 37:04.479
What are you doing?

37:04.480 --> 37:06.799
You two do not belong here.

37:06.800 --> 37:08.879
I shall escort you to the door.

37:10.680 --> 37:13.199
Stop this! Please,
you're hurting me!

37:13.200 --> 37:15.279
- Let go of me!
- This tutu's killing me.

37:15.280 --> 37:17.926
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

37:21.840 --> 37:25.408
- Hi.
- Hi!

37:25.480 --> 37:26.959
Are you a fairy?

37:26.960 --> 37:28.479
- No!
- Uh-uh!

37:28.480 --> 37:32.359
- You know, a Sugar Plum Fairy.
- Oh, well, yes, of course.

37:34.520 --> 37:38.599
- What's the matter?
- Oh, she must have a frog in her throat.

37:38.600 --> 37:42.679
I'm so nervous I'm sweating like a pig.

37:42.680 --> 37:45.519
It must be... the recital.

37:45.520 --> 37:47.051
Come here.

37:48.720 --> 37:51.969
- Here's my hanky.
- Gee, thanks!

37:55.400 --> 37:58.285
No, that's all right. You keep it.

37:58.520 --> 38:02.199
I'm nervous too.
Waldo's gonna be here.

38:02.200 --> 38:05.051
Waldo's Darla's boyfriend.

38:05.720 --> 38:08.639
- Do you have boyfriends?
- No!

38:08.640 --> 38:11.241
No, no, of course not.

38:11.920 --> 38:15.886
But there is one boy I'd
really love to get to know.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.407
His name is Alfalfa.

38:19.000 --> 38:21.839
- What a physique!
- Are you crazy?

38:21.840 --> 38:26.959
I used to know Alfalfa. He took
the best years of my life.

38:26.960 --> 38:31.399
Same here! That ugly scud
led me on as if he cared,

38:31.400 --> 38:34.683
then dropped me like a hot tamale.

38:37.640 --> 38:39.639
Plus, you know what?

38:39.640 --> 38:44.719
- No, what?
- I hear he dresses in girl's clothes.

38:47.400 --> 38:49.728
I don't miss him at all, except...

38:51.760 --> 38:53.879
his voice.

38:53.880 --> 38:59.644
When he sings, he makes me melt like
a Popsicle on the Fourth of July.

39:00.480 --> 39:03.650
He is awfully romantical.

39:04.040 --> 39:08.399
Well, it was lovely chatting,
but we really gotta go.

39:08.400 --> 39:09.839
Bye!

39:09.840 --> 39:13.169
All right, girls, it's time
to take your positions!

39:14.120 --> 39:16.482
It's show time!

39:16.560 --> 39:18.683
Come on now, girls.

39:20.120 --> 39:22.561
Hey Spanky, what are we doing?

39:25.280 --> 39:28.290
And now scenes from The Nutcracker.

39:33.840 --> 39:36.566
And two and three.

39:40.760 --> 39:42.325
Get rid of it.

39:52.160 --> 39:55.603
- Come here, hold my hand.
- Are you nuts?

40:24.480 --> 40:26.205
Get off!

40:32.520 --> 40:33.846
Get!

40:40.320 --> 40:41.885
Oh!

40:47.240 --> 40:49.010
Let's get outta here!

40:50.320 --> 40:52.479
Good thing
I finally caught that frog.

40:52.480 --> 40:55.199
Yeah, now all you got
to worry about is warts.

40:58.800 --> 41:00.206
Whoo!

41:02.880 --> 41:06.039
You ruined
my recital! Where's... Oh!

41:06.040 --> 41:08.279
Come on out of there, young lady.

41:08.280 --> 41:10.687
I wouldn't open that, if I was you.

41:11.320 --> 41:12.879
Oh!

41:12.880 --> 41:16.039
Well, this is a professional
school of ballet.

41:16.040 --> 41:18.399
Now get out and do not come back.

41:28.400 --> 41:30.839
I'll distract them
while you make a getaway.

41:30.840 --> 41:34.761
- Thanks, Spanky. You sure are a pal.
- Think nothin' of it.

41:39.240 --> 41:43.279
Hello again, you stud muffins.
Going my way?

41:43.280 --> 41:46.359
Gee, we'd love to,
but we're waiting around,

41:46.360 --> 41:49.131
to beat the shorts
off a couple of twerps.

41:49.720 --> 41:51.843
Your loss, baby.

41:56.480 --> 41:59.206
Got a burger to go with that shake?

42:03.760 --> 42:05.039
Aaah!

42:05.040 --> 42:07.004
That's him!

42:08.600 --> 42:11.280
Come back here,
you ugly little freak!

42:26.600 --> 42:28.211
And stay out!

42:46.200 --> 42:49.449
Things couldn't possibly
get any worse.

42:50.240 --> 42:53.839
Oh! Then the clouds
opened up and God said,

42:53.840 --> 42:56.399
"I hate you, Alfalfa."

42:56.400 --> 42:59.799
Nice tan. Any last words?

42:59.800 --> 43:03.209
Yeah. Uh, see ya!

43:16.320 --> 43:17.639
Hey!

43:17.640 --> 43:19.171
No, you don't!

43:23.120 --> 43:26.199
I'll let myself out.
Thank you.

43:26.200 --> 43:28.528
Well, you'd better.

43:32.160 --> 43:33.725
He lucked out!

43:57.360 --> 43:59.528
Alfalfa!

43:59.960 --> 44:03.639
This is a side of you
I've never seen before.

44:03.640 --> 44:05.171
Darla!

44:07.920 --> 44:12.279
Darla, there's a perfectly
logical explanation for this.

44:14.400 --> 44:16.443
Which I'll make up later.

44:24.640 --> 44:27.286
- Do you like pickles?
- I think they stink.

44:30.640 --> 44:32.365
I love pickles.

44:32.520 --> 44:36.088
- My mother makes me eat 'em.
- I'm crazy about 'em.

44:37.080 --> 44:39.601
I'll sell you my pickle for a nickel.

44:40.920 --> 44:42.849
How about two cents?

44:43.280 --> 44:45.084
Otay.

44:45.560 --> 44:48.279
I have two pickles,
I have two pickles

44:48.280 --> 44:51.279
I have two pickles today Hey, hey

44:54.040 --> 44:56.079
Because I get two pickles today

44:56.080 --> 44:57.406
Today

44:59.120 --> 45:02.244
- Rough day?
- Don't ask.

45:03.240 --> 45:05.010
Are these kosher?

45:24.480 --> 45:27.999
We are He-Man Woman Haters.

45:28.000 --> 45:32.199
We feed girls to alligators.

45:32.200 --> 45:35.919
The clubhouse
burned down mighty low.

45:35.920 --> 45:40.079
But we got a plan
to make some dough.

45:40.080 --> 45:43.523
Left, right, left, right.

45:46.320 --> 45:50.047
Looking good. This is
gonna be a piece of cake.

45:51.480 --> 45:54.519
Spanky, me and Porky got an idea.

45:54.520 --> 45:56.719
Keep it. You might need
it when you grow up.

45:56.720 --> 45:57.921
Otay.

46:01.080 --> 46:03.123
Hey, maybe this will work.

46:03.680 --> 46:05.211
Let's go.

46:05.360 --> 46:08.839
Ladies and gentlemen!
Boys and girls!

46:08.840 --> 46:13.439
Enter if you dare!
See the weird freak of nature!

46:13.440 --> 46:17.199
- Even science can't explain it!
- It's a really good show!

46:17.200 --> 46:21.519
Step right up and witness
this hideous mutant!

46:21.520 --> 46:24.679
- Amazing! Incredible!
- Come on, everybody!

46:24.680 --> 46:29.442
Four foot man-eating chicken!

46:35.200 --> 46:38.839
Hey folks, we need
to make some money!

46:38.840 --> 46:41.399
Give me a quarter!
Five dollars! Anything!

46:41.400 --> 46:43.999
We need to build a new clubhouse!

46:44.000 --> 46:46.439
Just hurry, hurry, hurry!

46:46.440 --> 46:49.599
People, people!
We need your money!

46:49.600 --> 46:52.639
You there, kid!
Wanna come in?

46:52.640 --> 46:55.366
At least people are ridin' the rides.

46:56.400 --> 46:58.409
Please go in.

47:00.440 --> 47:02.802
I will not think of Darla.

47:04.240 --> 47:06.602
I will not think of Darla!

47:07.720 --> 47:10.161
I will not think of Darla.

47:11.800 --> 47:13.923
Maybe Spanky's right.

47:14.320 --> 47:16.921
Maybe I should
just forget about love.

47:19.760 --> 47:21.610
Dang, I'm outta paper.

47:26.960 --> 47:30.084
No, not that kind of paper!

47:38.280 --> 47:40.164
Thanks, Petey.

47:48.160 --> 47:52.001
Skunked by that sleazy
sidewinder Spanky!

47:52.800 --> 47:55.446
It's his fault Darla hates me!

48:08.280 --> 48:12.007
Hop in, Petey! Sit!

48:19.920 --> 48:22.999
Come on, Spanky. So things
didn't quite pan out.

48:23.000 --> 48:26.719
"Didn't quite pan out"? We have
less money than when we came!

48:26.720 --> 48:30.003
I thought the talent show
was supposed to be free.

48:31.840 --> 48:34.999
- Look at all that money!
- What's goin' on?

48:35.000 --> 48:39.519
We just put up the sign and
people started paying us.

48:39.520 --> 48:41.959
Buckwheat, Porky, you're geniuses.

48:41.960 --> 48:43.679
Thanks!

48:43.680 --> 48:46.959
Look, how about if I take over
and give you guys a break?

48:46.960 --> 48:49.367
Otay!

48:50.680 --> 48:53.839
Money, money.

48:53.840 --> 48:55.559
Spanky McFarland!

48:55.560 --> 48:58.889
Miss Crabtree!

48:59.760 --> 49:03.248
I would expect this from a
four-year-old, but not from you!

49:04.440 --> 49:07.849
Spanky, tricking people
out of their money is wrong.

49:08.200 --> 49:10.846
It's just like cheating
on your homework.

49:11.200 --> 49:13.359
- But I...
- What are we to do with all this money?

49:13.360 --> 49:16.079
We can't give it back
to these people one by one.

49:16.080 --> 49:20.080
Miss Crabtree, I got a suggestion.

49:20.880 --> 49:23.367
What we could do is...

49:25.040 --> 49:26.810
Interesting.

49:27.120 --> 49:28.924
Intriguing.

49:29.600 --> 49:30.839
I love it.

49:42.880 --> 49:45.919
MAN; Whoo! Nice suit, kid!

49:52.080 --> 49:58.319
"L" is for the way you look at me

49:58.320 --> 50:05.079
"O" is for the only one I see

50:05.080 --> 50:11.359
"V" is very, very extraordinary

50:11.360 --> 50:18.039
Now, "E" is even more
than anyone that you adore

50:18.040 --> 50:19.599
And love

50:19.600 --> 50:24.599
is all that I can give to you

50:24.600 --> 50:28.399
Love is more than just a

50:28.400 --> 50:31.199
game for two

50:31.200 --> 50:34.119
Two in love can make it

50:34.120 --> 50:37.399
Take my heart
but please don't break it

50:37.400 --> 50:42.719
Love was made for me and you

50:42.720 --> 50:44.001
Dang.

50:47.560 --> 50:51.446
Miss Crabtree, do you got
room for just one more act?

50:51.800 --> 50:53.559
I think we could squeeze you in.

50:53.560 --> 50:56.559
- Thanks, Miss Crabtree!
- You're welcome.

50:56.560 --> 50:59.879
Well fellas, the president
saved your bacon.

50:59.880 --> 51:04.279
I convinced Miss Crabtree to
use the money as first prize

51:04.280 --> 51:05.799
in the Go-Cart Derby.

51:08.080 --> 51:10.479
Just think, in three days,
the money's ours.

51:10.480 --> 51:12.839
Everything else
may have gone wrong,

51:12.840 --> 51:16.169
but there's no way
we can lose the race.

51:26.320 --> 51:27.965
Yeah!

51:29.480 --> 51:33.366
- The Blur belongs to Butch.
- And Woim.

51:34.600 --> 51:36.559
Well, if it isn't Falafel.

51:36.560 --> 51:39.199
- Alfalfa!
- Whatever.

51:39.200 --> 51:42.159
I hope you didn't miss
my duet with Darla.

51:42.160 --> 51:44.199
You call that a duet?

51:44.200 --> 51:46.880
It was stupendous.

51:46.960 --> 51:48.719
She wasn't bad either.

51:48.720 --> 51:50.759
Oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin

51:50.760 --> 51:52.928
What on Earth are you doing?

51:53.080 --> 51:55.679
I'm warmin' up my vocalizer.

51:55.680 --> 51:59.441
I'm about to win Darla back
through song.

52:00.320 --> 52:06.766
I'm the barber of Seville...

52:07.160 --> 52:12.526
Figaro, Figaro, Figaro...

52:12.840 --> 52:16.362
Don't you get it?
Darla can't stand you.

52:16.680 --> 52:18.689
Alfalfa, you're on.

52:21.240 --> 52:24.159
Darla will love me
after I sing to her.

52:24.160 --> 52:29.002
Darla can't resist my voice.
She said so herself.

52:29.040 --> 52:30.685
Come on, dear.

52:36.120 --> 52:39.369
This is a song
about a tragic romance.

52:39.600 --> 52:42.159
I once fell in love with a girl,

52:42.160 --> 52:46.119
and through schemes and
betrayals by my best friend,

52:46.120 --> 52:49.079
she came to think
I was nothing more

52:49.080 --> 52:51.919
than a He-Man Woman Hater.

52:51.920 --> 52:55.010
But I'm a woman-lover!

52:55.200 --> 52:59.079
So let me raise a toast
to the girl I love most,

52:59.080 --> 53:01.599
in the whole world.

53:01.600 --> 53:04.119
Please don't say my name.
Please don't say my name.

53:04.120 --> 53:07.005
Darla.

53:20.600 --> 53:24.119
If I could make a wish

53:24.120 --> 53:27.563
I think I'd pass

53:28.080 --> 53:34.003
Can't think of anything I need

53:34.280 --> 53:36.519
No cigarettes, no sleep...

53:36.520 --> 53:38.239
I'm gonna put that fool
out of his misery!

53:38.240 --> 53:42.161
No lights, no sound

53:42.640 --> 53:48.131
Nothing to eat, no books to read

53:48.920 --> 53:51.248
Sometimes

53:51.640 --> 53:54.999
All I need is the air
that I breathe

53:55.000 --> 53:57.726
And to love you

53:59.440 --> 54:00.766
Whoa!

54:01.480 --> 54:04.959
All I need is the air
that I breathe

54:04.960 --> 54:08.359
Yes, to love you

54:08.360 --> 54:12.359
All I need is the air
that I breathe

54:12.360 --> 54:15.689
And to love you

54:15.800 --> 54:18.844
Oh, I hate you, Alfalfa.

54:19.240 --> 54:20.599
Dang!

54:29.680 --> 54:32.770
- Hey!
- Well, hello, Mr. Bubbles!

54:32.800 --> 54:35.599
That was the most
disgusting display

54:35.600 --> 54:39.039
of she-man woman-loving
I've ever seen!

54:39.040 --> 54:42.159
Don't talk to me,
you Benedict Arnold!

54:42.160 --> 54:44.399
You, you Judas Priest!

54:44.400 --> 54:46.439
This is all your fault!

54:46.440 --> 54:49.199
- All my fault?
- You torched the clubhouse.

54:49.200 --> 54:51.129
And it's all my fault?

54:51.640 --> 54:56.199
Say, you're supposed to be guarding
the go-cart, you Muzak-warbling wimp!

54:56.200 --> 54:59.599
Relax, you double-crossing
mud-muncher!

54:59.600 --> 55:03.043
I parked it right over there!

55:09.560 --> 55:11.364
It was right here!

55:12.560 --> 55:15.799
- Well, where is it?
- Boy, you're messing up left and right!

55:15.800 --> 55:18.606
That's it, you sissified
tweety-bird!

55:18.880 --> 55:22.959
- I wish I had a club to throw you out of!
- Me too!

55:22.960 --> 55:25.599
Well, you sewage-swigging slime ball,

55:25.600 --> 55:28.799
if there still was a club, I'd quit!

55:28.800 --> 55:30.519
- Good!
- Humph!

55:30.520 --> 55:32.484
- What a wimp.
- Yeah.

56:15.800 --> 56:18.239
Why don't go make up
with him, Alfalfa?

56:18.240 --> 56:20.799
You guys have been friends
since you were one.

56:20.800 --> 56:22.279
He started it!

56:22.280 --> 56:23.879
And you should finish it.

56:23.880 --> 56:26.039
You're a team, like Bert and Ernie.

56:26.040 --> 56:29.722
Superman and Clark Kent,
Milli and Vanilli.

56:30.600 --> 56:33.399
At least go talk to him.
What could it cost?

56:33.400 --> 56:36.319
You mean, besides
my dignity and pride?

56:36.320 --> 56:38.119
All I know is,

56:38.120 --> 56:41.005
you only make
a once-in-a-lifetime buddy,

56:41.160 --> 56:43.362
once in a lifetime.

57:06.360 --> 57:10.119
- Is Spanky home?
- I'm sorry, Alfalfa. Spanky isn't here.

57:10.120 --> 57:12.926
I'm sorry, Spanky.
Alfalfa's not here.

57:14.680 --> 57:17.531
- Darn!
- Darn!

57:25.840 --> 57:28.441
I thought I'd find you here.

57:30.320 --> 57:33.879
I'm sorry I called you a
double-crossing mud-muncher,

57:33.880 --> 57:36.359
and a sewage-swigging slime ball.

57:36.360 --> 57:39.799
I'm sorry I called you
a sissified tweety-bird,

57:39.800 --> 57:42.599
and a Muzak-warbling wimp.

57:42.600 --> 57:46.247
I'm sorry I called you
a barf-encrusted jumbo jerk.

57:46.400 --> 57:49.922
You didn't call me
a barf-encrusted jumbo jerk.

57:50.560 --> 57:53.445
Oh. I guess I was just thinking it.

57:54.240 --> 57:56.363
I'm sorry about the fire.

57:56.560 --> 58:00.560
I'm sorry about messing up
your picnic lunch with Darla.

58:01.080 --> 58:04.682
Maybe I'm sort of responsible
for the fire too, a little.

58:05.040 --> 58:08.319
You know, Spanky, I like girls.

58:08.320 --> 58:11.039
It might even get worse
as I get older.

58:11.040 --> 58:13.319
I know you like girls, 'Falf.

58:13.320 --> 58:16.399
The problem is, rules is rules.

58:16.400 --> 58:19.399
But is woman-hating
the important thing?

58:19.400 --> 58:22.679
I mean, couldn't we be a club
'cause we like something?

58:22.680 --> 58:24.120
Hmm.

58:24.600 --> 58:28.319
Shoot! Without a clubhouse,
we don't have a club.

58:28.320 --> 58:32.959
Hey! You guys burned down
a clubhouse, not a club!

58:32.960 --> 58:36.079
A club is buddies who stick
together, no matter what!

58:36.080 --> 58:37.566
Uh-huh!

58:40.920 --> 58:44.681
I just wish we could still
enter the Go-Cart Derby.

58:44.920 --> 58:46.679
But it's impossible.

58:46.680 --> 58:49.039
Who says it's impossible?

58:49.040 --> 58:52.039
Every one of us,
working together...

58:52.040 --> 58:55.164
Pal, that's all
the possible we need!

59:06.480 --> 59:10.039
We need a hammer.
And nails.

59:10.040 --> 59:12.288
A motor.

59:13.480 --> 59:16.479
We need a battery and a chassis,

59:16.480 --> 59:18.479
four axles and a wheel belt.

59:18.480 --> 59:20.479
Somebody get a supercharger.

59:20.480 --> 59:23.650
Go get it, guys!

59:50.120 --> 59:51.845
Here, Petey.

59:58.080 --> 01:00:00.567
- Screwdriver.
- Screwdriver.

01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:18.049
- Ratchet.
- Ratchet!

01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:26.039
Hey, Uh-Huh,
does it stink in there?

01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:27.765
Uh-huh!

01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:33.483
Monkey wrench!

01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:39.759
Ta-dum!

01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:42.281
Do us proud, buddy.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.964
You betcha!

01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:50.719
Hey, everybody! Don't forget!

01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:54.759
Following the Go-Cart Derby, there
will be a tiny tot bunny race at 3:30.

01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:58.043
Entrants must be five years
and under. See you there!

01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:00.759
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls,

01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:03.964
welcome to the 73rd Annual
Go-Cart Derby!

01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:14.159
Hey, guys, get in your cars!

01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:15.930
We're ready to start!

01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:18.239
You there, the kid in the blue.

01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:21.284
Stop horsing around.
You're gonna break your neck.

01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:24.083
How we gonna beat that?

01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:28.442
It looks like the Blur
with a new paint job!

01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:39.239
We're going to the race

01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:41.807
We're goin' to win first place

01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:44.600
And you have an ugly face

01:01:55.240 --> 01:01:56.879
Hi, Dad, it's me.

01:01:56.880 --> 01:02:00.766
You're gonna be so proud of me.
I'm gonna win this race.

01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:03.719
Waldo, you're the best son
money can buy.

01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:05.729
Thanks, Dad.

01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:08.799
I don't have an ugly face.
You have an ugly face!

01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:10.719
You have an ugly face!

01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:13.969
- You have an ugly face!
- Your mother has an ugly face!

01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:19.199
Now the race course
is marked with arrows,

01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:22.290
and it ends right back here
where it started from.

01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:25.604
Oh, great!

01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:29.279
- This is the prize money for the winner.
- Okay.

01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:31.528
It's just about $500.

01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:34.884
- Just say it's from an anonymous donor.
- You got it.

01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:38.319
Waldo, hurry up. We're late!

01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:40.999
Oh, please. We're making an entrance.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:44.359
Just sit back, relax and
leave everything to moi.

01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:51.519
I wonder where A.J. Ferguson is.

01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:53.799
I don't know, but I can't wait to meet him.

01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:56.890
Okay guys, this is it.
Fasten your seat belts.

01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:00.883
Well, well. Mr. Johnston.
Nice of you to join us.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.487
The last car
is finally in position.

01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:07.250
Well, if it isn't Waldo.

01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:14.199
All the money in the world is no
substitute for hard work and ingenuity.

01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:16.926
You lead a rich fantasy life.

01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:18.765
Thank you.

01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:22.879
- Moron.
- What are you doing with that?

01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:28.039
It's Darla's handkerchief. All
great knights ride into battle,

01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:30.839
wearing the colors
of their lady fair.

01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:34.169
I'm not hearing this.
I'm not hearing this.

01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:43.159
Hey, look! My mom's here!

01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:45.283
Whoopee.

01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:52.079
The first racer to cross
the finish line will receive,

01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:56.285
this genuine, gold-plated, cubic
zirconium-encrusted trophy!

01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:06.519
As well as the prize of $500!

01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:12.967
Go! Go!

01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:23.199
Gentlemen, start your engines!

01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:34.439
All right, ready. Steady.

01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:37.484
One, two, three, go!

01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:50.163
- Whoo-hoo!
- Yeah! Whoo!

01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:17.883
String 'em, Woim!

01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:23.839
- Ah! Ah!
- Oh, no!

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.043
- All right!
- Yeah!

01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:51.559
You snotwads stole our racer!

01:05:51.560 --> 01:05:55.519
Finders keepers, losers suck!

01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:58.007
Ah, bite me!

01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:04.879
Waldo, I think we have to turn here!

01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:07.199
Girls have no sense of direction.

01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:10.051
You know, you're starting
to get on my nerves.

01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:15.324
Huh? Uh-Oh!

01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:22.126
Oh!

01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:42.639
Watch out!

01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:44.808
Get out of the way!

01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:47.124
Coming through!

01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:51.810
- Excuse us!
- Move!

01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:57.601
- You little rascals!
- Sorry!

01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:00.879
10 points for the old guy!

01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:12.167
It's time to lose these losers.
Atomic batteries to power.

01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:15.611
Turbines to speed!

01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:24.847
- They're gettin' away!
- Hold on to your beanie!

01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:41.845
Activate rocket boosters!

01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:51.759
You idiot! You put them in backwards!

01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:10.799
These two again?

01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:13.367
I really hate to do this.

01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:15.641
Huh?

01:08:16.319 --> 01:08:18.408
Yikes! Spikes!

01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:36.439
Hey! You could've killed them!

01:08:36.439 --> 01:08:39.679
Just forget about that
soap-sucking nincompoop!

01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:43.198
So you're responsible for the
bubbles at the talent show!

01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:46.879
Pull over right now! I'm not
finishing this race with you!

01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:49.651
You got it, babe.
Now get out.

01:08:54.600 --> 01:08:57.246
Where in tarnation are we?

01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:08.090
Look! We're back in the race!

01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:10.602
Hey, pretty good shortcut!

01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:14.481
Hey, how'd they get here?

01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:17.486
Don't worry. This'll fix 'em!

01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:25.241
- Yeah!
- What's that?

01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:30.928
We can't see!

01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:34.881
Where are we? Help!

01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:41.363
- What's going on?
- I can't see!

01:09:49.439 --> 01:09:53.008
My eyes! I can't see!

01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:56.963
Hey, mind your own
business, rich boy!

01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:02.321
What a guy! Thanks, pal!

01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:13.599
Grab the wheel!

01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:16.719
Are you crazy or something?
We got a finish line to cross!

01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:20.686
- Not without this!
- You're nuts!

01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:30.686
- Whoa!
- Watch out! You're gonna fall!

01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:37.171
I'm gonna fall off! Hold my feet!

01:10:57.120 --> 01:10:59.766
Hold on! We're almost there!

01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:06.721
Winner by a hair! Yes!

01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:19.319
You did it, Alfalfa!
You won!

01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:21.199
We did it! All Of us!

01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:25.359
Gentlemen,
let's give Alfalfa a big,

01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:26.919
"Spoley-oley!"

01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:31.479
Spoley-oley! Spoley-oley!
Spoley-oley! Spoley-oley!

01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:35.039
- Spoley-oley! Spoley-oley! Spoley-oley!
- Thank you.

01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:38.039
Thank you, thank you, thank
you, thank you, thank you.

01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:40.039
It ain't right!

01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:43.359
We go through all the trouble
of stealing your racer,

01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:44.959
and you still win!

01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:48.559
Better brace yourself, because now
I'm really gonna kick your butt!

01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:51.559
I'm usually a lover, not a fighter

01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:54.764
but in your case I'm willing
to make an exception.

01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:03.609
Pig puckey!

01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:07.330
Allow me!

01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:15.404
- Looking good, man.
- Yeah!

01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:19.399
Hey, there's the guy who
risked his neck for us!

01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:23.650
I got to admit, he turned out
to be pretty okay, darn it.

01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:27.519
Put it there, pal.
You're quite a guy.

01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:29.959
Us machismo types have a club,

01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:32.319
the He-Man Woman Haters Club.

01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:36.399
Alfalfa, I'm extending
a membership offer here.

01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:39.439
- Now, what is it?
- That's not Waldo!

01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:42.689
You'll be hearing from my lawyers.

01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:47.363
Then who's this guy
who saved our butts?

01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:49.559
Hi, guys. What's up?

01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:52.650
A girl! Oh!

01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:55.728
Well, don't that beat all.

01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:01.839
Spanky!

01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:03.919
And now it gives me great pleasure

01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:05.879
to present this beautiful trophy,

01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:07.923
and the prize money,

01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:12.319
to Alfalfa Switzer and
Spanky McFarland.

01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:20.199
Is that a cowlick, or are
you just glad to see me?

01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:24.559
Ah, the strong, silent type, eh?

01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:26.799
Don't take this personal, lady,

01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:29.526
but my pal's real disappointed.

01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:32.079
Oh! What's the matter, sugar pie?

01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:35.319
Well, we were just
kinda hopin' that,

01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:38.410
A.J. Ferguson was
going to give us the trophy.

01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:42.044
Well, boys, today's your lucky day.

01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:46.410
'Cause that's exactly who I am!

01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:50.599
You're the best driver there is!

01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:54.486
Well, thank you very much!
You didn't do so bad yourself!

01:13:56.360 --> 01:14:00.879
Say, let's even things up.
How about one on this side?

01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:05.239
There you go!

01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:17.890
What a great race!

01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:21.599
I saw what you did to
save my hanky, Alfalfa.

01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:23.839
That was very heartwarming.

01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:26.199
And awfully romantical.

01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:29.359
Gee, thanks, but I
thought you hated me.

01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:33.119
I don't hate you. It's just
sometimes you do mean things,

01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:35.891
like playing tricks
on me at our picnic.

01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:38.599
I can explain that.

01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:41.929
It was me who wrecked
your picnic with Alfalfa.

01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:45.639
You see, I thought you was
trying to steal my best friend.

01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:48.919
I thought you were trying
to sabotage our club.

01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:51.439
But I think I was wrong.

01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:54.120
I'm sorry, you guys.

01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:57.206
My Alfalfinator!

01:14:57.400 --> 01:15:00.604
My delectable Darlooney!

01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:20.439
- So, do you live around here?
- Yeah.

01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:22.005
Do you like dolls?

01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:24.279
Mmm-mmm. Mmm-mmm.

01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:25.519
I do!

01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:28.039
Cool.

01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:31.439
Say!

01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:34.325
Have we betrayed our forefathers?

01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:39.559
Have we trampled on the generations
of honest woman-haters,

01:15:39.560 --> 01:15:42.206
who came before us?

01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:44.679
Uh-uh.

01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:47.839
Hey, everybody!

01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:50.486
Uh-Huh's learned a new word!

01:15:51.640 --> 01:15:56.879
Actually, I've always had a
rather extensive vocabulary,

01:15:56.880 --> 01:16:00.479
not to mention a phenomenal
grasp of grammar

01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:03.839
and a superlative
command of syntax.

01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:06.479
I simply chose not to employ them.

01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:10.002
Otay!

01:16:17.960 --> 01:16:22.722
Well, I guess things just
have to change sometimes.

01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:32.811
What's my line?

01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:45.766
- Hmm?
- What?

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:02.599
- Let's start over again.
- I don't want to!

01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:04.439
- You don't want to?
- No.

01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:06.839
- You got the hiccups?
- Yes.

01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:07.959
Okay, cut.

01:17:07.960 --> 01:17:11.239
- I used to have this...
- Don't worry.

01:17:11.240 --> 01:17:14.125
I forgot the word!

01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:18.879
What are you doing?

01:17:21.640 --> 01:17:23.479
Hmm!

01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:25.603
Oh!

01:17:32.840 --> 01:17:34.690
What a relief!

01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:42.404
- Yuck!
- Ooh!

01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:50.279
Allow me to introduce myself.

01:17:50.280 --> 01:17:52.801
- What an idiot.
- Watch it, bud.

01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:04.359
You have the most, and...

01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:05.959
Don't look at the camera, sweetie.

01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:07.519
Honey, don't look at the camera.

01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:10.799
Don't look at the camera.
Don't look at the camera.

01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:13.651
Brittany, stop looking
at the camera, please.

01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:15.361
Brittany!

01:18:23.680 --> 01:18:25.370
I winded my ear up.

01:18:56.200 --> 01:18:58.279
Now the race course is
marked off with arrows.

01:18:58.280 --> 01:19:00.839
And it'll start right...
And it'll end.

01:19:00.840 --> 01:19:03.042
Thank you. And it will end.

01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:06.045
Paper or plastic?

01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:11.039
And it will end, and it ends.

01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:13.971
It ends. Right. I knew
I'd find it somewhere.

01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:17.643
That is bad popcorn.

01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:29.561
Cut.

01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:37.085
You'll tell me when...
We're not going yet... Okay.

01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:39.319
Now the race course
is marked off with arrows.

01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:42.364
And it ends right back here
where it started from.

01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:44.604
- And cut.
- Cutting.

01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:46.319
I finally got that sucker.

01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:48.329
Otay!
