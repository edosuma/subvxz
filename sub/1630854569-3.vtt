WEBVTT

00:07.792 --> 00:09.295
OLIVIA: Dana?

00:18.346 --> 00:20.150
You're here.

00:20.183 --> 00:21.520
You're here.

00:25.093 --> 00:26.429
I was waiting for you.

00:32.174 --> 00:34.078
I was worried there would be

00:34.111 --> 00:36.482
another however many years
before I saw you again.

00:39.155 --> 00:40.825
And don't be long in here,
Ms. Liv.

00:41.760 --> 00:43.498
I don't want no trouble.

00:43.531 --> 00:45.433
OLIVIA: I'll get us
out as fast as I can.

00:48.306 --> 00:51.212
Take this. For Nigel.

00:52.048 --> 00:54.520
And could you have
Sabina or someone

00:54.553 --> 00:56.623
bring something warmer
for Dana to wear?

01:07.411 --> 01:10.250
Me getting caught up in this
house is a real risk for him.

01:11.019 --> 01:13.323
Margaret and I are not
on the best of terms.

01:13.356 --> 01:16.262
-What happened?
-Well, you actually.

01:16.930 --> 01:19.569
But never mind that now.

01:20.270 --> 01:23.343
Tell me,
who is this white man walking

01:23.376 --> 01:25.380
around here
calling himself your master?

01:26.517 --> 01:27.753
RUFUS: Dana.

01:27.786 --> 01:29.321
I want Dana.

01:30.257 --> 01:31.459
DANA: His name's Kevin.

01:32.529 --> 01:33.831
A friend.

01:34.132 --> 01:36.837
He was holding on to me
when I got pulled back.

01:37.506 --> 01:41.245
So, you can take folks
back and forth.

01:41.914 --> 01:43.617
I knew it.

01:45.955 --> 01:47.692
What happened to your eye?

01:48.728 --> 01:50.163
I saw the patroller.

01:51.667 --> 01:53.437
From the night
we saw each other,

01:53.470 --> 01:55.541
but that was
only yesterday for me.

01:57.344 --> 01:59.214
Time moves different.

01:59.549 --> 02:00.885
OLIVIA:
Interesting.

02:02.488 --> 02:04.793
So what'd you do with him?

02:06.530 --> 02:07.765
What do you mean?

02:07.966 --> 02:10.337
You took him
with you to the present.

02:10.839 --> 02:12.407
The patroller? No, I didn't.

02:13.142 --> 02:15.715
You did, Dana, I saw
you with my own eyes.

02:17.585 --> 02:19.154
I came back alone.

02:19.589 --> 02:21.893
-So what happened to him?
-I don't know.

02:22.729 --> 02:24.398
What are you thinking?

02:30.711 --> 02:33.350
I think what we better do

02:33.383 --> 02:37.157
is figure out exactly
what's happened to us.

02:38.159 --> 02:40.197
I think it might have
something to do with Rufus.

02:40.230 --> 02:41.901
What is your connection
to that boy?

02:41.934 --> 02:44.706
I don't know. Isn't he what
brought you here?

02:44.739 --> 02:48.480
-No.
-Then how did you get here?

02:48.514 --> 02:50.450
(bell ringing)

02:50.918 --> 02:52.354
MARGARET: Rufus!

02:52.789 --> 02:54.793
Stop that clamoring.

02:54.826 --> 02:56.362
It is enough to wake the dead,

02:56.697 --> 02:58.935
Look, here's
Carrie with your breakfast.

02:58.968 --> 03:00.705
RUFUS: I don't want breakfast.

03:00.738 --> 03:04.345
Oh, Mr. Franklin, I am so sorry.

03:04.378 --> 03:06.416
-Did Rufus wake you?
-KEVIN: Oh, it's fine.

03:06.449 --> 03:09.923
All morning long he's been
begging for Dana to read to him.

03:09.956 --> 03:11.794
Where is Dana?

03:11.827 --> 03:14.231
Well, I suspect you rang
your bell but you couldn't hear.

03:15.033 --> 03:16.670
Well, perhaps
she's still in the attic.

03:18.841 --> 03:21.212
OLIVIA: It was
some sort of massacre.

03:22.549 --> 03:23.851
The family was hacked
all to pieces,

03:23.884 --> 03:25.722
fire set to everything.

03:25.755 --> 03:27.659
I hid in the forest for days

03:27.692 --> 03:29.496
before somebody
even came and found me.

03:30.898 --> 03:33.804
There was an old medicine
woman foraging for plants.

03:34.171 --> 03:37.812
She thought I was crazy.
I thought I was crazy.

03:38.413 --> 03:40.350
Until this one day
I heard someone mention

03:40.383 --> 03:41.720
Easton, Maryland

03:41.753 --> 03:43.558
And that rang a bell.

03:43.591 --> 03:46.396
Reggie's father and mine,
your grandfathers,

03:46.429 --> 03:48.433
they both came up to Brooklyn.

03:48.466 --> 03:51.974
Together from Baltimore,
and Reggie had family

03:52.007 --> 03:55.514
-in Easton going way back.
-Wait a minute, wait--
wait a minute.

03:56.850 --> 03:58.620
My father had ancestors here?

03:59.623 --> 04:01.459
Could Rufus be one of them?

04:01.493 --> 04:02.929
(footsteps)

04:03.898 --> 04:05.502
Oh, Jesus, Dana,

04:05.535 --> 04:06.971
I thought
you'd gone back without me.

04:07.004 --> 04:08.608
What are you doing up here?

04:08.641 --> 04:09.943
This is-- this is Kevin.

04:10.578 --> 04:11.813
This is--

04:13.984 --> 04:15.386
Kevin, this is...

04:15.755 --> 04:16.990
My mother.

04:19.461 --> 04:20.698
Hello.

04:22.434 --> 04:24.539
What-- what is this place?
What happened last night?

04:25.508 --> 04:26.743
Margaret locked me in.

04:27.110 --> 04:28.614
Why didn't you call for help?

04:29.215 --> 04:31.386
And wake the whole house up?

04:31.419 --> 04:33.624
The last thing we need
is to cause a scene.

04:33.657 --> 04:35.093
(bell ringing)

04:35.126 --> 04:36.630
What is that ringing?

04:38.634 --> 04:40.404
KEVIN: Rufus is calling for you.

04:40.437 --> 04:42.609
I think we should try
to get out of here now.

04:42.642 --> 04:46.617
Kevin, we need you to distract
the family just for a moment

04:46.650 --> 04:48.052
and then we'll all go.

04:48.621 --> 04:50.423
-Yeah--
-(sighing)

04:51.727 --> 04:54.632
-Okay.
-DANA: It'll be just a moment.

04:59.074 --> 05:00.511
That's him?

05:02.615 --> 05:03.851
He's gonna get you killed.

05:09.128 --> 05:12.602
(theme music)

05:18.547 --> 05:20.952
TOM: What in God's name
is all this noise for?

05:20.985 --> 05:22.689
RUFUS: I want Dana.

05:22.722 --> 05:24.927
MARGARET: Tom, please don't
make things worse.

05:24.960 --> 05:27.766
TOM: What's the problem?
Go get her--

05:27.799 --> 05:29.803
LUKE: Celeste
has a dress for Dana.

05:29.836 --> 05:32.041
-They still in the attic, Sir?
-Uh, yes.

05:32.074 --> 05:35.380
TOM: I will personally tan
every hide under this roof!

05:35.413 --> 05:37.418
I can not afford to look like--

05:37.451 --> 05:40.524
You need to go talk to him,
find out everything he knows.

05:40.858 --> 05:42.762
What exactly is happening to him

05:42.795 --> 05:44.432
right before
he calls you to him?

05:44.465 --> 05:46.636
And what happens
with him when you go?

05:49.141 --> 05:50.845
Who's there?

05:50.878 --> 05:52.949
It's just old Celeste,
Ms. Olivia.

05:53.150 --> 05:55.688
Luke said you was
just looking for a dress.

05:55.721 --> 05:57.792
Of course Luke
would send for you.

05:58.393 --> 06:00.931
Thank you.
Will-- will you help me?

06:01.700 --> 06:03.704
-RUFUS: I want Dana!
-TOM: Margaret.

06:03.737 --> 06:06.109
The boy is inconsolable
and it is unacceptable.

06:06.142 --> 06:08.179
We have guests
beginning to arrive.

06:08.212 --> 06:09.983
-RUFUS: Dana.
-Who?

06:10.016 --> 06:11.987
I just saw the minister's
carriage pull up just now

06:12.020 --> 06:14.091
and Broadus right behind.

06:14.759 --> 06:15.961
Dana!

06:16.328 --> 06:17.866
Are you up there?

06:17.899 --> 06:19.603
She is, Miss.

06:19.636 --> 06:21.105
She's not
supposed to know I'm here.

06:24.612 --> 06:27.050
Witch! Witch!

06:27.351 --> 06:30.625
Dana! Remove her
from this house at once.

06:30.658 --> 06:34.465
How dare you step foot anywhere
near me or my child, you savage.

06:34.499 --> 06:36.101
TOM: Quiet yourself.

06:38.640 --> 06:40.911
What business have you in here?

06:41.278 --> 06:44.018
It was Mr. Kevin here
who called on Luke

06:44.051 --> 06:45.955
for a medicine woman.

06:45.988 --> 06:48.828
Dana was feeling
very ill all day yesterday

06:48.861 --> 06:50.463
and I thought
it was an emergency.

06:51.533 --> 06:53.470
I don't recall any complaints.

06:53.504 --> 06:55.841
OLIVIA: Woman troubles,
Mr. Weylin.

06:58.914 --> 07:00.149
(clearing throat)

07:01.520 --> 07:03.657
And what are you doing here?

07:03.690 --> 07:05.495
With Sabina gone,
there was some need

07:05.528 --> 07:06.897
for extra help in the house.

07:06.930 --> 07:08.600
Come Celeste,
back to the kitchen.

07:12.809 --> 07:14.780
I want her out, Thomas.

07:14.813 --> 07:16.448
-Out!
-TOM: Enough.

07:18.152 --> 07:20.658
-Are you done?
-Almost.

07:20.691 --> 07:22.561
TOM: Then grab your things.

07:23.897 --> 07:26.001
Escort her somewhere
where she may wait for Dana.

07:28.941 --> 07:31.145
Meanwhile,
I must beg of you to have Dana

07:31.178 --> 07:33.984
tend to
my pitiful excuse of a son.

07:34.519 --> 07:37.758
He seems hell bent on
seeing her before he is quiet.

07:38.827 --> 07:40.096
I'll go check on him.

07:46.075 --> 07:48.647
Why must you humiliate me, so?

07:48.680 --> 07:50.918
How can you allow
that woman passage

07:50.951 --> 07:53.223
on this land after
everything that she's done?

07:53.256 --> 07:55.928
She has brought
the devil upon our child twice.

07:55.961 --> 07:58.867
Margaret,
go attend to the guests.

08:06.683 --> 08:10.022
Go question the boy
and meet me at the cook house.

08:11.158 --> 08:13.897
-RUFUS: Dana!
-(bell ringing)

08:16.570 --> 08:19.108
I-- I am very sorry.

08:19.141 --> 08:20.845
Now, don't apologize.

08:20.878 --> 08:22.715
The party's put Margaret
in a state.

08:22.748 --> 08:24.920
I would have done
the same thing.

08:24.953 --> 08:28.928
Now, Olivia has delivered
a good amount of stock for me.

08:28.961 --> 08:33.671
I have to say I did notice
a general laziness about Dana.

08:33.704 --> 08:36.308
How long has it been
since you procured her?

08:38.045 --> 08:41.719
Not long. A week, two.

08:42.020 --> 08:47.331
Well, you may have purchased two
for the price of one. Lucky.

08:47.364 --> 08:50.203
That should recoup
for your stolen belongings.

08:52.975 --> 08:55.280
RUFUS: Dana, there you are.

08:55.313 --> 08:57.585
I had the best dream last night.

08:57.618 --> 08:59.956
I was this Gulliver fella.

08:59.989 --> 09:02.127
And I got tied up.

09:03.329 --> 09:06.603
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

09:07.505 --> 09:09.609
Well, will
you continue reading to me?

09:10.811 --> 09:13.717
Dana, can I talk
to you for a sec?

09:13.750 --> 09:15.788
She just got here.

09:15.821 --> 09:17.391
-Please don't take her away.
-Just a second, Rufus.

09:17.424 --> 09:19.962
-What's happening?
-They think you're pregnant.

09:20.430 --> 09:23.904
-Can we go right now?
-No.

09:23.937 --> 09:26.042
No, I need to figure out
some information on this kid.

09:26.075 --> 09:27.745
What information?

09:27.778 --> 09:29.315
Olivia and I
just figured out that he...

09:29.348 --> 09:31.319
he might be related to me.

09:31.352 --> 09:33.857
-What?
-Yeah, he might be my ancestor.

09:34.726 --> 09:37.030
I need to figure out
what's going on on his side.

09:37.063 --> 09:38.733
I think that's why
I'm being pulled back.

09:39.234 --> 09:41.004
Minister, please.

09:41.973 --> 09:43.977
Lay your hands on Rufus.

09:44.211 --> 09:46.683
Bless him in this room.

09:46.716 --> 09:48.854
Pray for his recovery

09:49.856 --> 09:51.727
and rid this house of the evil

09:51.760 --> 09:53.864
that that devil's
servant brought with her.

09:53.897 --> 09:56.836
Mama, what are
you talking about?

09:57.470 --> 09:59.743
That black witch
that your father

09:59.776 --> 10:02.414
still patronizes was
snuck in here this morning.

10:02.447 --> 10:06.188
HOWELL: Rufus, you ought
to be more careful.

10:08.994 --> 10:11.800
Heavenly father,
protect and heal this child.

10:11.833 --> 10:14.371
And protect us all against Satan
and all the evil spirits

10:14.404 --> 10:17.310
who roam through the world,
seeking the ruin of souls. Amen.

10:17.845 --> 10:20.283
-Oh, hello.
-Oh!

10:22.387 --> 10:27.097
Minister Howell, may I introduce
Mr. Kevin Franklin of New York.

10:27.130 --> 10:28.901
Oh!

10:28.934 --> 10:31.239
Mr. Franklin
was arrested of his clothes

10:31.272 --> 10:33.075
at dagger and gunpoint.

10:33.544 --> 10:35.213
By the grace of God,

10:35.246 --> 10:37.317
that he stumbled
upon our precious Rufus

10:37.350 --> 10:40.257
and found
his way to our doorstep.

10:40.290 --> 10:42.795
HOWELL: The Lord hath
blessed Mr. Franklin

10:42.828 --> 10:44.364
with your Christian charity.

10:44.699 --> 10:47.137
Speaking of which,
we shouldn't leave Tom

10:47.170 --> 10:50.711
or the libations
he promised us waiting.

10:50.744 --> 10:53.016
You're right. Come, come, come.

10:53.049 --> 10:54.384
You too, Mr. Franklin.

10:55.453 --> 10:58.994
Mr. Franklin, you mustn't
continue being so shy.

10:59.027 --> 11:01.934
Come meet everyone.
Dana can watch after Rufus

11:01.967 --> 11:05.373
-a little longer, can't she?
-Uh, can I have just a minute.

11:07.043 --> 11:08.245
MARGARET: Of course.

11:10.316 --> 11:13.222
I really don't think we should
be separated right now.

11:13.255 --> 11:15.293
Just let me find out
what I need to find out

11:15.326 --> 11:17.865
and-- and then I'll
come get you and we can go.

11:18.432 --> 11:19.869
I promise.

11:23.342 --> 11:25.146
(sighs)

11:29.922 --> 11:32.996
Okay, Rufus.
I'll make you a deal.

11:33.029 --> 11:36.468
I'll read to you if you answer
a few questions for me.

11:44.952 --> 11:48.158
-Hello, Margaret.
-Good day to you, Charles.

11:49.829 --> 11:51.899
-Isadora.
-Hello, Margaret.

11:52.333 --> 11:54.539
HOWELL: Eggnog for little
Temperance, Isadora?

11:54.572 --> 11:56.810
ISADORA: Oh, yes, Minister.

11:56.843 --> 11:59.081
Spirits might actually
brighten up her disposition.

11:59.114 --> 12:01.419
She's quite morose
about our return to England.

12:01.452 --> 12:03.323
-MARGARET: Oh.
-HOWELL: Cheers, everyone!

12:03.356 --> 12:05.193
ISADORA: Margaret!

12:05.226 --> 12:08.032
What you've done with this
parlor is quite... bold.

12:08.634 --> 12:13.042
Where have my sister's
chairs gone and her curtains?

12:13.075 --> 12:15.179
Those were taken
to charity long ago.

12:17.350 --> 12:18.920
Mama, what are those?

12:20.490 --> 12:22.160
I don't know.

12:22.629 --> 12:26.035
Margaret, what are these?
Carvings?

12:26.068 --> 12:27.572
A Christmas observance.

12:27.605 --> 12:30.176
These are remembrances
of my lost angels.

12:30.209 --> 12:32.815
A bit morbid for a party.

12:32.848 --> 12:36.823
Some traditions are
best left on the pig farm.

12:41.065 --> 12:42.502
I thought my daddy
was gonna kill me

12:42.535 --> 12:44.471
when I threw
those curtains in the hearth.

12:44.505 --> 12:46.977
There was all the smoke
and I couldn't breathe.

12:47.010 --> 12:48.312
Wait, you started the fire?

12:49.949 --> 12:51.520
I didn't think it'd get so big.

12:51.553 --> 12:54.324
I was just angry with
daddy for horse whipping me.

12:54.759 --> 12:57.097
-He whips you?
-RUFUS: Not anymore.

12:57.130 --> 12:59.268
Mama made him stop,
threatened to run away,

12:59.301 --> 13:01.138
cause he shouldn't treat
his own flesh and blood

13:01.171 --> 13:03.109
the same way
he treat you niggers.

13:03.142 --> 13:05.013
But I still got
some scars I could show you.

13:05.046 --> 13:06.550
Don't call me that.

13:06.583 --> 13:08.052
Rufus.

13:09.589 --> 13:12.226
-Call you what?
-Nigger.

13:13.229 --> 13:14.464
Why not?

13:15.166 --> 13:17.905
Where I come from,
that's an insult.

13:19.040 --> 13:20.443
Where do you come from?

13:21.546 --> 13:23.149
It's hard to explain.

13:23.182 --> 13:25.252
You a witch then,
like Ms. Olivia?

13:25.754 --> 13:27.424
Do you think she's a witch?

13:27.457 --> 13:28.993
That's what Mama said.

13:30.095 --> 13:32.969
Daddy made her mama's nurse
when I was in her belly.

13:33.002 --> 13:35.874
'Cause none of mama's babies
before ever survived.

13:36.342 --> 13:38.547
But when I was real little,
Mama says

13:38.580 --> 13:42.988
that Olivia summoned the devil
in my nursery to take me away.

13:45.594 --> 13:47.196
That was me, Rufus.

13:49.201 --> 13:50.871
That was
the first night you called.

13:51.606 --> 13:53.242
I don't remember that.

13:53.275 --> 13:56.148
(footsteps approaching)

13:57.952 --> 14:00.489
Hi Carrie, hi Nigel,
you can come in.

14:07.705 --> 14:09.140
Is this for me?

14:10.443 --> 14:12.180
Thank you, Carrie.

14:12.782 --> 14:14.384
Look at what Carrie made for me.

14:15.587 --> 14:17.290
She's so talented.

14:20.229 --> 14:22.267
Carrie said for you
to come to the cookhouse.

14:22.300 --> 14:23.937
Ms. Olivia is calling for you.

14:23.970 --> 14:25.574
She's supposed to read to me.

14:25.607 --> 14:27.477
I-- I'll be right back.

14:27.511 --> 14:29.447
What if you leave again?

14:29.949 --> 14:31.452
I don't think
that's going to happen.

14:31.485 --> 14:33.055
You might.

14:33.957 --> 14:35.326
It won't. Here.

14:35.359 --> 14:37.463
Ring this bell
if I take too long.

14:46.281 --> 14:48.252
MARGARET: How dare you
invite Isadora here

14:48.285 --> 14:50.190
without my consultation.

14:50.223 --> 14:52.327
Her sister was once
mistress of this house,

14:52.360 --> 14:54.364
and it is her good opinion of us

14:54.397 --> 14:57.170
that will ultimately
sway Charles.

14:57.671 --> 14:59.140
Charles.

15:00.677 --> 15:04.083
-So happy you could join us.
-Good Yuletide, Tom.

15:05.019 --> 15:06.956
Isadora. Hmm.

15:10.998 --> 15:16.108
Forgive me, but the occasion
compels me toward gratitude,

15:16.141 --> 15:19.481
gratitude for old friends
and new acquaintances.

15:19.515 --> 15:23.656
Mrs. Weylin and I are humbled by
your presence here this evening.

15:23.957 --> 15:25.594
We also stand in remembrance

15:25.627 --> 15:28.633
of those who are
but present in spirit.

15:29.434 --> 15:34.043
Let us all raise a glass
now to the memory of Hannah.

15:34.410 --> 15:35.647
A loving wife.

15:37.685 --> 15:41.425
Thank you, Tom.
Show us to the library.

15:41.458 --> 15:44.164
I'd like to see how it's fared
under Margaret's renovations.

15:44.197 --> 15:45.534
Of course, dear heart.

15:45.935 --> 15:47.403
Mr. Franklin, please.

15:55.621 --> 15:58.159
Minister Howell,
would you care for some company?

15:58.192 --> 15:59.995
HOWELL: Come, come.

16:01.666 --> 16:03.402
TOM: Oh, I love reading.

16:03.435 --> 16:06.609
In truth, very few
are permitted in this room.

16:06.943 --> 16:11.552
Your presence is testament to my
admiration for you, Isadora.

16:12.554 --> 16:16.395
Your shared devotion to
my family's memory touches me,

16:16.428 --> 16:20.203
but you remember
Hannah's generosity of spirit.

16:20.236 --> 16:23.142
She would want
these books to be read.

16:23.175 --> 16:25.714
My uncle has just
brought back from London

16:25.747 --> 16:27.752
a most exquisite novel

16:27.785 --> 16:31.726
-by a Ms. Jane Austen.
-Pride and Prejudice.

16:34.632 --> 16:36.167
Yes, that's it.

16:37.236 --> 16:38.740
Are you familiar?

16:38.773 --> 16:41.679
Yeah, I've seen that--
I read that, um,

16:42.080 --> 16:44.150
a while ago. Not that long ago.

16:45.386 --> 16:48.225
-Mr. Darcy, right?
-ISADORA: Yes. (laughs)

16:48.258 --> 16:50.564
Well, you must have
been in England recently then.

16:50.597 --> 16:53.069
Yeah, I love London.

16:53.102 --> 16:54.606
I much prefer verse.

16:54.639 --> 16:57.477
These lady novels
with their silly women

16:57.511 --> 16:59.548
prattling on about marriage.

17:00.082 --> 17:03.221
It bored me to tears,
I'm afraid, Mr. Franklin.

17:03.756 --> 17:06.328
-Are you married, Sir?
-No.

17:07.063 --> 17:10.537
Oh. I see. Are you a libertine
by any chance?

17:10.938 --> 17:14.111
Yeah, yeah, in some ways.
In some ways, I guess.

17:14.144 --> 17:17.083
Um, I think, um...

17:19.822 --> 17:21.458
What's a libertine?

17:23.697 --> 17:26.503
-Oh!
-(all laughing)

17:26.536 --> 17:28.607
Don't you think Hannah
would have loved our guest?

17:28.640 --> 17:30.276
-(laughs)
-Mmm-hmm.

17:30.309 --> 17:32.147
He's also quite
a skilled piano player.

17:32.180 --> 17:33.684
Oh!

17:33.717 --> 17:35.688
Perhaps you would play for us,
Mr. Franklin?

17:35.721 --> 17:38.192
(gasps) Oh, would you?
We love music.

17:38.225 --> 17:39.529
-Please.
-Um, I--

17:39.562 --> 17:42.400
Everyone. Everyone.

17:42.433 --> 17:44.806
I would ask that you
all join me in the parlor.

17:44.839 --> 17:47.778
We've planned a small pageant
for all to enjoy.

17:47.811 --> 17:49.414
Come, come.

17:49.447 --> 17:51.384
-Please.
-(Margaret clears throat)

17:52.453 --> 17:53.690
MARGARET: Gather up everyone.

17:53.723 --> 17:55.727
Please come in to the parlor.

17:58.700 --> 18:00.135
Well done.

18:02.306 --> 18:03.543
KEVIN: Oh.

18:04.612 --> 18:05.914
OLIVIA: You talked to the boy?

18:05.947 --> 18:08.319
-What'd you learn?
-Not much.

18:08.352 --> 18:10.524
Nothing seems to make any sense.

18:10.557 --> 18:12.394
Every time has
been completely different.

18:12.427 --> 18:14.130
I can't seem to find
a common thread.

18:14.565 --> 18:17.370
He doesn't seem to have any more
control over this than we do.

18:18.339 --> 18:21.211
It looks like whatever it is
that's bringing us back here,

18:21.746 --> 18:23.783
it happens right
before he loses consciousness.

18:24.351 --> 18:26.255
OLIVIA: He's awake
when he calls you?

18:26.288 --> 18:28.660
Yeah, but when I arrive,
he's always passed out.

18:28.693 --> 18:30.664
And I thought it happened
whenever he was in danger,

18:30.697 --> 18:33.469
but it turns out he set the fire
from the last time himself.

18:33.503 --> 18:37.410
The last thing that he remembers
is thinking that his dad

18:37.443 --> 18:38.880
was gonna kill him
once the curtains caught.

18:38.913 --> 18:40.483
-And then he saw me--
-Wait a minute.

18:40.517 --> 18:42.487
That his father
was going to kill him?

18:42.521 --> 18:44.224
But then there's
something that I don't--

18:44.257 --> 18:46.495
-I don't understand.
-OLIVIA: What?

18:47.396 --> 18:49.802
The first time that I was here,
I remember someone

18:49.835 --> 18:53.408
being in the room with him.
I-- I remember a woman.

18:53.877 --> 18:56.549
I think that she was trying
to turn him over in the crib.

18:56.582 --> 18:58.251
Wasn't that you?

18:58.753 --> 19:00.189
No.

19:01.793 --> 19:03.597
Then who was it?

19:03.630 --> 19:05.634
People are always
coming and going around here,

19:05.667 --> 19:07.604
and that was
almost a decade ago now.

19:08.105 --> 19:10.243
-(bell ringing)
-RUFUS: Dana!

19:10.276 --> 19:12.515
Oh, that's Rufus.
I told him I'd go.

19:12.548 --> 19:13.883
Go, go to him.

19:14.552 --> 19:16.689
RUFUS: Dana!

19:20.564 --> 19:24.639
My sweet Rufus
and I had hoped to offer

19:24.672 --> 19:26.576
a little entertainment
to you all,

19:26.609 --> 19:28.312
but as you can probably hear,

19:28.345 --> 19:30.750
he convalesces
upstairs with a broken leg.

19:31.519 --> 19:34.992
However, I've been able
to whip up a little diversion

19:35.025 --> 19:38.934
in its place, and I sincerely
hope you will all enjoy.

19:38.967 --> 19:42.406
(clapping rhythmically
and humming)

19:46.448 --> 19:49.589
Whoo!

19:49.622 --> 19:52.928
(humming and clapping)

19:52.961 --> 19:54.799
MARGARET: Whoo!

19:54.832 --> 19:56.703
TOM: What did I tell you
about ringing that bell?

19:56.736 --> 19:58.940
You are deliberately
provoking me, son.

19:58.973 --> 20:00.643
DANA: It was my fault.
It was my fault!

20:02.514 --> 20:04.351
Move, girl.
This does not concern you.

20:04.384 --> 20:06.421
I-- I was in the kitchen
and I got distracted.

20:06.454 --> 20:07.791
He was just calling for me.

20:08.526 --> 20:10.530
(clapping and singing
in distance)

20:13.603 --> 20:14.805
Give me the damn bell.

20:24.692 --> 20:26.295
You okay?

20:26.328 --> 20:29.300
I'm fine.
Will you read to me now?

20:30.770 --> 20:32.607
(applause)

20:33.008 --> 20:36.682
Bravo, yes!

20:37.316 --> 20:39.755
Let's all show
them our appreciation.

20:55.119 --> 20:57.490
(gasps) Carrie?

20:59.528 --> 21:01.832
It's Sarah's daughter.

21:02.199 --> 21:06.441
I believe I held
this one as a baby. Aw.

21:07.010 --> 21:09.882
Her mother
was my nurse, Charles.

21:13.088 --> 21:15.359
Will you take me
to see your mother, dear?

21:15.392 --> 21:16.763
Is she about?

21:16.796 --> 21:18.465
Yeah. (sighs)

21:30.422 --> 21:33.496
I feel I must apologize
on behalf of our host.

21:34.531 --> 21:36.435
Oh, what for?

21:36.468 --> 21:38.873
His open courtship of me.

21:39.240 --> 21:41.546
(sighs) And how he grovels
at my wife's feet,

21:41.579 --> 21:44.585
pretending to care about music
and Hannah's library.

21:44.618 --> 21:46.889
The whole world
knows he's barely literate.

21:47.825 --> 21:53.368
(shudders) Tom Weylin, handsome
but low, don't you agree?

21:54.270 --> 21:56.508
Oh, I don't--
I don't know him well enough.

21:59.147 --> 22:01.652
But you can see
that he is handsome, no?

22:02.053 --> 22:03.522
(scoffs)

22:05.125 --> 22:06.930
Oh, don't get jealous,
Mr. Franklin.

22:06.963 --> 22:08.533
You're handsome too,
though I'm sure you've

22:08.566 --> 22:09.801
been told this before.

22:10.269 --> 22:12.039
In your years as a bachelor.

22:13.141 --> 22:16.114
Uh, no, no, no. No, not really.

22:17.618 --> 22:19.521
Let me make it quite clear,

22:19.955 --> 22:23.729
you are most welcome sight
at this gathering.

22:25.634 --> 22:26.869
Oh, well.

22:28.171 --> 22:30.409
Uh, great. You too-- You too.

22:31.512 --> 22:34.417
So. You've enjoyed seeing me?

22:35.052 --> 22:36.689
Oh, whoa!

22:39.662 --> 22:43.737
-Forgive my absence.
-No apology necessary.

22:43.770 --> 22:48.946
Mr. Franklin here was giving
me a lecture on the pianoforte.

22:49.147 --> 22:50.683
-(clears throat)
-Hmm.

22:51.050 --> 22:54.090
Uh, shall we continue
our conversation elsewhere?

22:54.892 --> 22:56.495
Absolutely.

22:56.762 --> 22:58.899
TOM: Why don't
you play something for us, hmm?

23:00.637 --> 23:03.576
"But would come up to
my very feet without starting.

23:04.210 --> 23:06.749
"The riders would
leap them over my hand

23:06.782 --> 23:08.184
"as I held it on the ground."

23:11.826 --> 23:13.596
RUFUS: Thank you, Cyrus.

23:18.238 --> 23:19.775
Are you Rufus?

23:21.512 --> 23:22.747
Yes.

23:27.657 --> 23:28.859
I'm Temperance.

23:29.962 --> 23:32.600
Our parents know each other.
Hello.

23:33.736 --> 23:35.206
Hello.

23:35.239 --> 23:37.043
I heard you had
an unfortunate accident

23:37.076 --> 23:38.646
and I wanted to see it.

23:39.948 --> 23:41.919
How long is your convalescence?

23:41.952 --> 23:43.956
RUFUS: The doctor
said four weeks.

23:44.925 --> 23:47.797
TEMPERANCE: Four weeks.
That's not very long.

23:49.868 --> 23:51.539
Who gave you this?

23:51.572 --> 23:53.776
-My friends.
-What friends?

23:55.112 --> 23:57.651
RUFUS: Carrie and Nigel.
They live here.

23:59.688 --> 24:02.927
You still play with your slaves?

24:03.629 --> 24:07.169
You still play
with dolls and slaves.

24:08.973 --> 24:10.510
What are we gonna do with you?

24:18.693 --> 24:21.632
Nigger, come. Clean this up.

24:24.705 --> 24:28.111
Rufus, your girl
is insubordinate.

24:28.646 --> 24:31.886
If we were in my house,
I would strike her.

24:31.919 --> 24:34.858
She needs to be taught a lesson.

24:35.459 --> 24:39.701
Come here, wench,
so I can slap your face.

24:42.607 --> 24:44.945
Come here, wench,

24:45.413 --> 24:47.651
so I can slap your face.

24:47.684 --> 24:49.588
Do I get to slap yours back?

24:53.896 --> 24:56.067
(screaming)

24:56.769 --> 24:58.573
-TEMPERANCE: Daddy!
-RUFUS: Uh oh.

24:58.606 --> 25:00.543
TEMPERANCE: Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!

25:03.683 --> 25:05.152
Are we a team, Rufus?

25:05.721 --> 25:08.091
-Yes.
-So here's what we're gonna do.

25:08.325 --> 25:09.929
If anyone comes up here,

25:09.962 --> 25:11.632
you're gonna say I didn't do it.

25:11.999 --> 25:14.872
(Kevin playing "Head Over
Heels" by Tears for Fears)

25:14.905 --> 25:16.274
Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!

25:16.307 --> 25:17.878
-Daddy!
-CHARLES: Temperance.

25:17.911 --> 25:19.648
Why, whatever's the matter?

25:19.681 --> 25:23.923
That negress upstairs
said she'd strike me!

25:23.956 --> 25:25.594
CHARLES: What negress?

25:25.627 --> 25:27.598
TEMPERANCE: The one
upstairs with Rufus.

25:27.631 --> 25:30.970
MARGARET: Take my hand and let
Miss Margaret take care of this.

25:31.939 --> 25:33.610
KEVIN: Wait, Charles.

25:33.643 --> 25:35.279
You threatened
my daughter, you animal.

25:35.312 --> 25:36.816
I didn't. I promise you, Sir.

25:36.849 --> 25:38.887
Oh, so these are mock tears?

25:38.920 --> 25:40.757
She and Rufus
were playing just fine,

25:40.790 --> 25:43.128
and then she ran out
of the room. Right, Rufus?

25:45.800 --> 25:49.006
Nonsense. Nonsense.

25:49.273 --> 25:50.777
No. This must
be dealt with handily.

25:50.810 --> 25:52.246
I wish I could punish her,
Charles,

25:52.279 --> 25:54.184
but unfortunately
she's not my property.

25:54.217 --> 25:57.891
-Who does she belong to?
-She's, uh, she's mine.

26:00.997 --> 26:02.266
Well.

26:03.803 --> 26:05.206
Well, I do not
know you well enough

26:05.239 --> 26:07.209
to speak on you
as a slaver, Sir.

26:07.544 --> 26:09.214
But no nigger of mine

26:09.247 --> 26:11.284
would evade punishment
for insubordination.

26:12.086 --> 26:13.923
I-- I will punish her.

26:14.124 --> 26:16.929
And what shall that be?
Will you strike her?

26:16.962 --> 26:19.267
That is what she has
threatened of my daughter.

26:19.300 --> 26:20.837
TOM: Charles...

26:20.870 --> 26:22.240
No, I refuse
to accept anything other

26:22.273 --> 26:23.877
than he'd give her
a slap well laid

26:23.910 --> 26:25.646
until she is scarred
with her lesson.

26:26.849 --> 26:28.786
Yeah, I can't--
I can't-- I can't do that.

26:37.036 --> 26:38.706
-And why not, Sir?
-I'm pregnant.

26:40.977 --> 26:43.081
Yes, yes, she's with child,

26:43.114 --> 26:46.922
and, um, I'd be left
with damaged property.

26:47.991 --> 26:49.326
I see then.

26:52.734 --> 26:55.306
Oh, this rogue
would protect his property

26:55.339 --> 26:57.009
before my daughter's honor.

26:57.644 --> 26:59.113
Come, dear.
We must find your mother.

26:59.146 --> 27:00.917
We're going.

27:00.950 --> 27:03.055
TOM: Wait, Charles.
We have much to discuss.

27:03.088 --> 27:05.425
-We're family.
-CHARLES: We were family.

27:05.927 --> 27:08.264
Isadora will hear
about this insult presently.

27:09.100 --> 27:11.972
TOM: Charles, come back.
We can fix this.

27:12.908 --> 27:14.678
Franklin, get out here!

27:24.498 --> 27:27.871
Something happened
between you and Broadus.

27:28.305 --> 27:29.708
Yes.

27:30.242 --> 27:34.150
My slave insulted him,
and for that I am so sorry--

27:34.183 --> 27:37.256
TOM: Shut up. No, before that.

27:37.658 --> 27:39.728
I know the man. Hmm?

27:40.429 --> 27:43.401
There is no way he'd leave
without getting his way.

27:43.769 --> 27:46.207
So what did you say
to him to make him leave?

27:46.240 --> 27:47.811
Uh, I didn't say anything.

27:47.844 --> 27:51.050
-Um, he was--
-You're lying.

27:55.459 --> 27:56.995
Tell me.

27:57.329 --> 27:59.768
Or I will exact
the same punishment

27:59.801 --> 28:02.005
-that he did not.
-He touched me, he touched me!

28:04.076 --> 28:05.278
What?

28:06.849 --> 28:11.023
He-- he grabbed my genitals.

28:12.961 --> 28:14.196
Mildly.

28:16.000 --> 28:17.269
TOM: Oh.

28:23.348 --> 28:24.818
Oh.

28:24.851 --> 28:26.955
(laughing)

28:28.826 --> 28:30.062
Filthy rascal.

28:30.095 --> 28:32.767
Mr. Franklin, I thank you.

28:34.504 --> 28:37.042
-You thank me?
-TOM: Yes.

28:39.146 --> 28:40.482
(Tom laughs)

28:40.516 --> 28:42.185
Can we go now?

28:42.486 --> 28:45.092
Tom, we need to leave.

28:45.125 --> 28:47.497
-Uh, Dana is still sick.
-TOM: Tend to your business.

28:47.530 --> 28:50.435
We will drink
in celebration upon your return.

28:53.041 --> 28:54.310
Someone touched you?

28:57.517 --> 28:58.919
Let's go.

29:03.261 --> 29:05.933
-She looks just like Hannah.
-Olivia.

29:06.134 --> 29:08.840
SARAH: Be careful saying
that around Margaret.

29:08.873 --> 29:10.577
ISADORA: How can you stand
to be around that woman?

29:10.610 --> 29:13.414
SARAH: I don't set foot in
there, especially that parlor.

29:15.920 --> 29:18.124
She sold my sons
for that furniture, Isadora.

29:18.859 --> 29:20.061
For that furniture.

29:20.395 --> 29:22.166
Oh, Sarah.

29:22.199 --> 29:24.905
That furniture and China plates
and fancy things

29:24.938 --> 29:26.909
that she had when she first
moved in was good enough

29:26.942 --> 29:29.346
for Ms. Hannah and you when
you all are real ladies.

29:29.714 --> 29:31.284
I just don't understand.
I'm sorry.

29:31.317 --> 29:33.221
Oh, Sarah.

29:33.956 --> 29:35.392
(floor creaking)

29:35.425 --> 29:37.396
SARAH: Can I help you?

29:38.131 --> 29:41.103
Oh, we were
just looking for Olivia.

29:41.304 --> 29:44.243
I'm sure my husband
wonders where I've gone.

29:45.580 --> 29:47.249
I will miss you, Sarah.

29:58.438 --> 30:01.912
Uh, Tom gave us leave to attend
to Dana's, um, ailment.

30:01.945 --> 30:03.215
Let's find Luke.

30:03.248 --> 30:04.517
He said he'd lend the wagon.

30:05.653 --> 30:07.122
Goodbye, Sarah.

30:09.594 --> 30:12.132
SARAH: Dana, let me
have a word with you.

30:14.203 --> 30:15.539
Here, take this into the parlor.

30:23.388 --> 30:24.925
If that woman's
studying you so close,

30:24.958 --> 30:26.160
I suspect you with child.

30:26.595 --> 30:27.997
And if so...

30:29.200 --> 30:31.104
then you must get down
on your hands and knees

30:31.137 --> 30:33.375
and beg Mr. Kevin to give
your children their freedom.

30:33.408 --> 30:35.278
I see the affects
you have on him.

30:35.513 --> 30:36.915
Don't end up like me.

30:37.149 --> 30:40.021
Be sensible. You hear me?

30:42.092 --> 30:43.294
Now get.

30:56.989 --> 30:59.426
OLIVIA

31:04.003 --> 31:05.438
Y'all get on inside.

31:16.127 --> 31:17.530
ALICE: Mama Livia!

31:18.999 --> 31:21.437
-Hi, sweetie.
-ALICE: What took you so long?

31:21.470 --> 31:23.108
OLIVIA:
We got into a bit of trouble.

31:23.141 --> 31:25.646
Get back inside
before you catch a cold!

31:26.480 --> 31:28.251
Oh, it's freezing!

31:29.153 --> 31:31.490
I'll make us some tea,
it'll warm us up.

31:34.998 --> 31:36.702
Dana, you remember Alice?

31:36.735 --> 31:38.237
Hagar's daughter.

31:39.541 --> 31:41.645
Alice, why
don't you show Ms. Dana

31:41.678 --> 31:43.147
what you've been working on?

31:45.753 --> 31:47.623
Kevin, may I have your help?

31:48.291 --> 31:50.663
-KEVIN: Oh, yeah, of course.
-I'm making a family.

31:50.696 --> 31:54.270
This is Mama Livia,
Mommy and me.

31:54.303 --> 31:56.407
-(meows)
-And this is my cat, Daisy.

31:59.581 --> 32:01.250
So, you her boyfriend?

32:01.618 --> 32:03.054
Oh.

32:03.421 --> 32:06.394
No, no, we just met, actually.
Uh--

32:06.427 --> 32:09.968
-Did she say that?
-No. But I'm not an idiot.

32:12.774 --> 32:16.347
This is Eleanor,
Brittany and Jeanette.

32:16.380 --> 32:18.384
They're really nice.

32:19.253 --> 32:20.656
I want you to listen closely.

32:23.094 --> 32:24.631
It's going to seem scary,

32:24.664 --> 32:26.334
but it's not as bad as it looks.

32:26.367 --> 32:28.038
She'll survive, okay?

32:28.071 --> 32:30.042
What?

32:30.075 --> 32:31.611
OLIVIA: Just make sure
she drinks water.

32:32.780 --> 32:34.216
Tea's almost ready.

32:38.659 --> 32:40.162
DANA: Where's Hagar?

32:40.195 --> 32:41.998
Hagar passed
a couple months ago.

32:42.734 --> 32:44.403
Right after your last visit.

32:45.773 --> 32:48.144
I've been taking
care of Alice ever since.

32:49.748 --> 32:52.185
I think it must have
been some kind of cancer.

32:54.256 --> 32:56.327
She doesn't have
any other family?

32:56.360 --> 32:57.697
OLIVIA: None that I found.

32:58.098 --> 33:00.235
Her father was
a slave sold South,

33:00.268 --> 33:01.538
but Hagar was a free woman.

33:01.571 --> 33:03.241
Said she was born free.

33:03.274 --> 33:04.778
But you have no idea

33:04.811 --> 33:07.216
how difficult it would be
for her to stay that way.

33:07.249 --> 33:11.357
So when I saw that you took
Daniel back, I got excited.

33:11.390 --> 33:13.094
I thought that maybe
if I could figure out

33:13.127 --> 33:15.399
how to go back too,
I could bring her with me.

33:15.432 --> 33:16.735
That was wrong.

33:17.671 --> 33:21.511
And I can't just leave her here.
Not at that age.

33:24.818 --> 33:27.255
Oh, I wanna give you something.

33:44.557 --> 33:46.728
-What is that?
-OLIVIA: It's my wedding ring.

33:47.196 --> 33:51.070
For the longest time
it was the only thing I had

33:51.371 --> 33:55.279
that was proof of the life
that I knew I had lived.

33:55.312 --> 33:57.550
All of the memories
that were in my mind.

33:58.451 --> 34:02.526
That they really happened,
that I hadn't just made them up.

34:05.365 --> 34:07.269
Why are you giving it to me?

34:07.302 --> 34:09.675
It belonged
to your father's grandmother,

34:09.708 --> 34:11.143
so I want you to have it.

34:13.481 --> 34:15.653
Just in case
this is my life now.

34:18.458 --> 34:21.164
What? But it's not.

34:21.197 --> 34:23.268
I'm not so sure that's right.

34:23.301 --> 34:25.205
I think I might be stuck.

34:25.238 --> 34:26.675
But you can stay close to me.

34:26.708 --> 34:28.478
You can grab on
to me, like Kevin.

34:28.512 --> 34:30.449
OLIVIA: How are you
so sure Kevin will go back?

34:30.482 --> 34:32.554
You don't know what
happened to the patrolman--

34:32.587 --> 34:34.891
But it's not the same, you're
from a different time than him!

34:34.924 --> 34:36.460
And I'm from
a different time than you.

34:37.195 --> 34:39.132
2016.

34:39.634 --> 34:41.571
That is
a different world for me.

34:45.378 --> 34:47.182
What...

34:47.584 --> 34:49.320
What are you saying?

34:49.353 --> 34:50.723
OLIVIA: I'm saying
I need more time.

34:51.391 --> 34:55.866
Enough time to figure out
somebody to take care of Alice.

34:56.434 --> 34:58.605
At least enough time to see if--

34:59.039 --> 35:01.210
if I really
can go back on my own.

35:08.525 --> 35:11.196
I have wanted nothing
more than to go back home.

35:13.367 --> 35:16.206
All this time, nothing
more than to see you again.

35:17.643 --> 35:19.446
But I don't want to get lost.

35:20.916 --> 35:24.322
Listen. I did
figure out something today.

35:25.091 --> 35:27.262
At the river,
you went back home.

35:27.295 --> 35:28.865
Tom pulled a gun out on you.

35:30.368 --> 35:31.872
Yeah.

35:31.905 --> 35:33.743
OLIVIA: And that patroller did
what he did.

35:33.776 --> 35:35.613
But, when we first
met in the hallway,

35:35.646 --> 35:38.484
when you disappeared,
what happened?

35:39.219 --> 35:43.361
You rushed at me
and you scared me.

35:43.394 --> 35:44.931
And you thought I was dead.

35:45.866 --> 35:47.335
Yeah.

35:49.339 --> 35:51.244
Drink your tea.

35:51.277 --> 35:52.947
Earlier you were telling
me about all the times

35:52.980 --> 35:55.820
you were brought back,
that the boy was frightened.

35:55.853 --> 35:57.288
(Dana clears throat)

35:57.489 --> 35:59.393
But I think
it's not that simple.

35:59.426 --> 36:01.531
I think he has to be
more than just scared.

36:02.466 --> 36:06.508
I think he has to believe
he is going to die and I suspect

36:06.541 --> 36:09.781
something similar has
to happen for you to go home.

36:11.885 --> 36:13.822
So, I put a little
something in your tea.

36:15.425 --> 36:16.928
-A poison.
-What?

36:17.429 --> 36:19.767
OLIVIA: You need to hurry up
and get help.

36:20.636 --> 36:22.574
-What the fuck?
-(gasping)

36:22.607 --> 36:25.378
You need to get help
or you're not going to make it.

36:25.746 --> 36:27.416
What's happening to her?

36:27.449 --> 36:28.986
OLIVIA: I hope Rufus
doesn't call you back,

36:29.019 --> 36:30.956
-but I suspect he will.
-(gasping continues)

36:31.758 --> 36:34.263
Take this. Remember.

36:34.296 --> 36:35.933
Remember? Remember what?

36:35.966 --> 36:37.770
-Dana? Dana?
-(gasping)

36:38.572 --> 36:39.774
Dana, Dana, Dana!

36:41.578 --> 36:43.715
-(Dana gasping)
-Dana.

36:47.355 --> 36:48.725
Dana!
