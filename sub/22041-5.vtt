WEBVTT

00:00.552 --> 00:02.262
- Previously on Hotel Hell,
(dramatic music)

00:02.262 --> 00:04.264
I found out the upscaled Juniper Hill Inn

00:04.264 --> 00:06.342
in Windsor, Vermont, is bleeding money.

00:07.538 --> 00:10.343
So you're losing over $200,000 a year?

00:10.343 --> 00:11.739
- We're in trouble.

00:11.739 --> 00:13.544
- [Gordon] And it's because
the owners have spent a fortune

00:13.544 --> 00:15.922
to make this place look
like an art museum.

00:15.922 --> 00:17.941
- I've always thought that you
should live with nice things,

00:17.941 --> 00:19.623
if you can afford them.
(bright music)

00:19.623 --> 00:21.933
- Treating it like their
own private country club.

00:21.933 --> 00:24.274
(laughing)

00:24.274 --> 00:25.869
I quickly realised the rooms were vacant

00:25.869 --> 00:27.162
because Robert and Ari

00:27.162 --> 00:29.352
have alienated themselves from the town

00:29.352 --> 00:32.499
and the Inn's appearance
is completely deceiving.

00:32.499 --> 00:34.555
What is that smell? Smells like shit.

00:34.555 --> 00:36.380
It's like someone's shat under the bed.

00:36.380 --> 00:38.371
And instead of working
with their employees.

00:38.371 --> 00:39.240
- Excuse me!

00:39.240 --> 00:41.119
Excuse me. Excuse me.

00:41.119 --> 00:42.052
- Excuse me.

00:42.052 --> 00:43.303
- I am the boss.

00:43.303 --> 00:44.669
- This place is fucked.

00:44.669 --> 00:47.245
- [Gordon] They're oppressing
them like indented servants.

00:47.245 --> 00:50.154
- I'm barely surviving,
financially and emotionally.

00:50.154 --> 00:52.646
- I'd be very careful about
coming down on me too hard.

00:52.646 --> 00:55.367
- And communication is
almost non-existent.

00:55.367 --> 00:56.546
Unless you fucking ask,

00:56.546 --> 00:58.245
how are you supposed to fucking know?

00:58.245 --> 00:59.434
- Well, I have been asking!

00:59.434 --> 01:00.386
I said, "Where does this chicken-"

01:00.386 --> 01:01.762
- So, ask him again!

01:02.666 --> 01:03.845
And what's worse,

01:03.845 --> 01:05.575
I was completely shocked
to learn that the staff

01:05.575 --> 01:07.181
never get paid on time.

01:07.181 --> 01:10.049
- Like pulling teeth to get my pay check.

01:10.049 --> 01:10.917
- You don't get paid?

01:10.917 --> 01:12.572
- It takes forever to get my pay check,

01:12.572 --> 01:15.513
and when I do it's usually,
something's left out.

01:15.513 --> 01:17.108
- [Gordon] And when I
confronted Robert and Ari

01:17.108 --> 01:20.173
in front of everyone,
all I got was excuses.

01:20.173 --> 01:22.540
- I don't have a secretary,
Gordon. I'm sorry.

01:22.540 --> 01:24.949
- Are you always this pathetic?

01:24.949 --> 01:26.211
- They don't have to work here.

01:26.211 --> 01:29.401
- How dare you! Go on,
then, you pompous fuck!

01:29.401 --> 01:31.403
- Don't talk to me like that.

01:31.403 --> 01:34.660
- You still haven't got it,
that this place is sinking!

01:38.268 --> 01:41.309
(rock theme music)

01:43.865 --> 01:46.317
(feet clatter)

01:46.317 --> 01:49.620
(multiple explosions)

01:51.289 --> 01:53.896
(doors clunk)

01:56.144 --> 01:58.837
(tiger growls)

02:01.902 --> 02:05.135
(neon buzzes)

02:05.135 --> 02:06.376
- So far, my stay at Vermont's

02:06.376 --> 02:08.138
Juniper Hill Inn has been shocking.

02:08.138 --> 02:10.067
Yeah, that smells like shit.

02:10.067 --> 02:12.882
And the root of the problem
is beginning to show.

02:12.882 --> 02:14.592
You don't get paid?

02:14.592 --> 02:17.992
I've seen with my own eyes
how poorly this place is run,

02:17.992 --> 02:20.664
but now I need to see what
happens to the bottom line

02:20.664 --> 02:22.027
(laughing)
when Robert and Ari

02:22.027 --> 02:24.686
use Juniper Hill as their
own private playground,

02:24.686 --> 02:26.448
entertaining all their friends.

02:26.448 --> 02:28.752
I'm hoping the estate
manager, Ryan, can help me.

02:28.752 --> 02:29.701
A lot of the staff are telling me

02:29.701 --> 02:33.194
their friends pop up from Manhattan

02:33.194 --> 02:36.166
and come and spend weekends
and sit, drink and be merry.

02:36.166 --> 02:38.637
Are these guys actually paying?

02:38.637 --> 02:39.816
(suspenseful music)
- Ah, no.

02:39.816 --> 02:43.528
Robert had a slew of friends
come and stay for free

02:43.528 --> 02:45.832
and eat for free for weeks at a time,

02:45.832 --> 02:48.345
and that's why we've been losing
money since I've been here.

02:48.345 --> 02:50.316
- What do the colours mean,
and how do we understand that?

02:50.316 --> 02:51.473
- [Ryan] Green means they paid in full.

02:51.473 --> 02:52.954
Red means they have not paid.

02:52.954 --> 02:53.976
- Oh, my god.

02:53.976 --> 02:55.310
- I have 50 room nights.

02:55.310 --> 02:57.125
That's between November and December.

02:57.125 --> 02:58.480
- Just two months?
- The average,

02:58.480 --> 03:00.232
they're $200 a night.

03:00.232 --> 03:03.339
- But that's like $10,000 in revenue.

03:03.339 --> 03:04.802
- That's $10,000.

03:06.008 --> 03:07.076
- They're running it

03:07.076 --> 03:08.241
- A club house.
- Almost like a club house.

03:08.241 --> 03:10.440
It's almost like they're
trying to buy friends, and...

03:10.440 --> 03:13.641
- Robert prides himself as
the superior business person.

03:13.641 --> 03:15.382
Robert walks around like he's the king

03:15.382 --> 03:17.124
and that everybody
here's a bunch of hicks.

03:17.124 --> 03:19.908
- This is insane. This is
like a private club for him.

03:19.908 --> 03:21.315
- He's worked with the servers before

03:21.315 --> 03:23.333
and accepted a portion of the tips.

03:23.333 --> 03:24.895
(dramatic music)
- Oh my god.

03:24.895 --> 03:26.279
Fucking hell.

03:26.279 --> 03:28.875
He's taking their bloody tips!

03:28.875 --> 03:30.835
This guy is mad.

03:30.835 --> 03:31.763
I can't believe this.

03:31.763 --> 03:34.057
He doesn't pay them and
then he takes their tips.

03:34.057 --> 03:37.610
I've gotta talk to him.
(dramatic music)

03:38.551 --> 03:39.420
How are we?

03:39.420 --> 03:41.002
Barbara, how are you today?
- Good.

03:41.002 --> 03:42.597
- Just out of interest,

03:42.597 --> 03:45.788
is it true that Robert takes
a percentage of the tips?

03:45.788 --> 03:46.819
- Yes.

03:46.819 --> 03:47.688
- He does?
- Yeah.

03:47.688 --> 03:50.115
- [Gordon] And what percentage
of the tips does he take?

03:50.115 --> 03:51.627
- What we get.

03:51.627 --> 03:52.732
- [Gordon] He gets the same as you?

03:52.732 --> 03:53.601
- Yeah.

03:53.601 --> 03:55.985
- It's really hard to
keep track of the tips.

03:55.985 --> 03:58.957
The bookkeeping, it doesn't-
- Yeah, I see.

03:58.957 --> 03:59.826
- It seems inconsistent to me.

03:59.826 --> 04:01.616
- But why is he touching the tips?

04:01.616 --> 04:02.888
- He did the same thing for New Year's.

04:02.888 --> 04:06.225
They felt that because they
needed to cover part of the band

04:06.225 --> 04:07.758
that they took the tips off-

04:07.758 --> 04:08.877
- Of our tips.

04:10.552 --> 04:12.273
That's why we don't make anything here.

04:12.273 --> 04:14.890
- An owner has no right
to take the staff's tips

04:14.890 --> 04:16.433
and with all the room and food comps

04:16.433 --> 04:17.829
Robert is giving his friends

04:17.829 --> 04:20.552
it's no wonder the Inn is struggling.

04:20.552 --> 04:22.168
The staff shouldn't be subsidising the Inn

04:22.168 --> 04:23.138
so Robert and his friends

04:23.138 --> 04:24.900
get to live the high life for free.

04:24.900 --> 04:26.266
It's sickening.

04:26.266 --> 04:27.402
I have to confront him

04:27.402 --> 04:28.805
and figure out this nonsense.
(knocks on door)

04:28.805 --> 04:29.988
(dog yaps)

04:29.988 --> 04:33.015
I just had a look round and I just,

04:34.555 --> 04:35.932
I am flabbergasted.

04:35.932 --> 04:39.466
I'm gonna be really frank and
I'm gonna try to stay so calm,

04:39.466 --> 04:42.949
but if I smell bs, that you
start going into denial,

04:42.949 --> 04:45.128
I'm gonna let rip again.
(tense music)

04:45.128 --> 04:47.871
I studied your reservations.

04:47.871 --> 04:49.831
Last November and December,

04:49.831 --> 04:53.491
49 rooms were given out for free,

04:53.491 --> 04:58.204
and on top of that they
ate, they drank for nothing,

04:58.204 --> 04:59.466
and not even tipping.

04:59.466 --> 05:02.083
And I'm just, "What the
fuck are you doing?"

05:02.083 --> 05:03.272
Tell me why.

05:03.272 --> 05:06.358
- I thought I needed
to have somebody here.

05:06.358 --> 05:09.079
Rather than having two
other guests in the hotel

05:09.079 --> 05:13.063
all by themselves, to have more energy.

05:13.063 --> 05:14.762
- You're making it worse.

05:14.762 --> 05:16.827
Not only do your friends not leave tips

05:16.827 --> 05:20.038
but when people do tip the
staff you take a share.

05:20.038 --> 05:22.770
- On nights that I work I did take tips.

05:22.770 --> 05:24.702
- That is disgusting.

05:26.388 --> 05:27.859
Why do you think you have a right to that?

05:27.859 --> 05:30.799
- I have tried to work
with my staff to teach them

05:30.799 --> 05:32.843
that this is the way I want service done.

05:32.843 --> 05:33.854
- You're so bad.

05:33.854 --> 05:35.783
- I take a percentage of the tips

05:35.783 --> 05:37.535
based on the amount of work that I do.

05:37.535 --> 05:39.777
- And who does the books on those tips?

05:39.777 --> 05:40.797
- Ari.

05:40.797 --> 05:41.665
(scoffs)

05:41.665 --> 05:42.915
But if I'm doing their job,

05:42.915 --> 05:44.771
and I can't get it across to them...

05:44.771 --> 05:46.300
- You're the owner.

05:46.300 --> 05:48.233
You're not the head bus
boy. You're not the barman.

05:48.233 --> 05:50.339
You're the fucking owner.

05:50.339 --> 05:52.018
- What I was saying
wasn't getting through,

05:52.018 --> 05:55.334
so the psychology was that
if I started to take tips

05:55.334 --> 05:57.016
they would maybe pay attention to that.

05:57.016 --> 05:58.660
- That is insane.

05:58.660 --> 06:00.141
That is the worst management model

06:00.141 --> 06:02.112
I've ever heard in my entire life.

06:02.112 --> 06:03.248
Do you honestly need

06:03.248 --> 06:05.873
a 70-year-old lady's tips?
- No.

06:08.493 --> 06:11.903
- So 15, 20 grand's worth
of complimentary rooms

06:11.903 --> 06:13.811
and the food in a two-month period.

06:13.811 --> 06:15.208
I'm just, it doesn't make sense.

06:15.208 --> 06:17.752
- I have to tell you that
the reason I did that

06:17.752 --> 06:20.693
was because I thought that they
would at least tip my staff.

06:20.693 --> 06:22.677
- But they didn't tip your staff.

06:23.664 --> 06:26.021
Sorry to piss on your bonfire.

06:26.021 --> 06:27.856
- Well, then I will call my friends

06:27.856 --> 06:29.921
and I will tell them,
"Look, what happened?"

06:29.921 --> 06:31.652
- You haven't got the fucking balls

06:31.652 --> 06:34.008
to call your friends and
ask them to leave a tip.

06:34.008 --> 06:34.877
- Yes, I do.

06:34.877 --> 06:36.189
- Call them, then.

06:36.189 --> 06:38.883
(tense music)

06:42.621 --> 06:45.405
And ask them, "I thought at
least, out of generosity,

06:45.405 --> 06:47.230
you would have left a
couple of hundred dollars

06:47.230 --> 06:48.988
tip for the team."
(phone rings)

06:48.988 --> 06:49.856
- [Dana] Hello?

06:49.856 --> 06:50.725
- Dana?

06:50.725 --> 06:52.381
- Yes?
- It's Robert.

06:52.381 --> 06:54.685
You stayed here recently

06:54.685 --> 06:59.461
and I was under the impression
that you and Greg left a tip.

06:59.461 --> 07:00.622
Did you leave a tip?

07:00.622 --> 07:03.183
- [Dana] Well, I left the money with you.

07:03.183 --> 07:04.052
- No, no, no.

07:04.052 --> 07:07.218
But you said you were going
to send additional tip.

07:07.218 --> 07:09.419
- You mean-
- I think my time's done here.

07:09.419 --> 07:12.557
- That was one of the things
that I was hoping you had done.

07:12.557 --> 07:15.310
- [Dana] Oh, if I didn't do
what I was supposed to do,

07:15.310 --> 07:18.521
I'm very sorry and I'll-
- "I left the money with you."

07:18.521 --> 07:21.285
- Well, wait a minute.
There's others to call too.

07:21.285 --> 07:23.161
Gordon.
- Oh dear.

07:23.161 --> 07:26.804
- Gordon has left. He thinks
I'm stealing my staff's tips.

07:26.804 --> 07:28.524
(dramatic music)
- Unbelievable.

07:30.721 --> 07:32.056
- Hey, Ray. It's Robert.

07:32.056 --> 07:33.130
Did you tip the staff?

07:33.130 --> 07:36.004
'Cause they're telling people
that they haven't been tipped.

07:36.004 --> 07:38.385
- "I left the money with you."

07:38.385 --> 07:43.244
- Oh, so I need to do
that. I somehow lost that.

07:43.244 --> 07:44.975
- Fucking idiot!

07:44.975 --> 07:48.509
- Gordon left, thinking I'm a liar.

07:48.509 --> 07:49.377
(door slams)

07:49.377 --> 07:52.694
I feel as if I'm at the end of my rope.

07:54.078 --> 07:56.497
I mean, I'm gonna lose everything.

07:56.497 --> 07:59.489
I'm gonna have to start all
over again if this doesn't work

07:59.489 --> 08:01.898
(dog yaps)
and I don't seem

08:01.898 --> 08:04.972
that I can do it any more.

08:04.972 --> 08:06.067
I know I can't do it.

08:10.606 --> 08:15.819
(truck roars away)
(dramatic music)

08:17.520 --> 08:19.207
(truck roars away)
- I just left Juniper Hill

08:19.207 --> 08:22.544
after catching Robert in a lie
about his staff getting tips.

08:22.544 --> 08:26.141
- I was under the impression
that you and Greg left a tip?

08:26.141 --> 08:27.156
Did you leave a tip?

08:27.156 --> 08:28.852
- [Dana] Well, I left the money with you.

08:28.852 --> 08:29.874
- The guy is maddening,

08:29.874 --> 08:31.511
and I don't know if I've got it in me

08:31.511 --> 08:32.563
to help fix the place.

08:32.563 --> 08:34.806
I'm so pissed off with Robert right now.

08:34.806 --> 08:38.455
Honestly, I cannot stand any
more of these bloody lies.

08:38.455 --> 08:41.948
This guy doesn't even deserve
the team that is in his hotel.

08:41.948 --> 08:43.929
He treats everyone so badly.

08:43.929 --> 08:46.244
- When you're in your
fucking kitchen all day long

08:46.244 --> 08:47.485
and you're on the internet instead of

08:47.485 --> 08:49.164
actually trying to perfect a menu.

08:49.164 --> 08:50.634
- He doesn't even pay them properly.

08:50.634 --> 08:53.543
- I had to wait five weeks
before I got a pay check.

08:53.543 --> 08:55.264
- I work very long days

08:55.264 --> 08:57.641
and I haven't been paid in three weeks.

08:57.641 --> 09:00.561
- How can someone so rich not
pay the people he employs?

09:01.645 --> 09:04.365
That's something I simply won't stand for.

09:04.365 --> 09:05.264
(truck screeches)

09:05.264 --> 09:08.944
As angry as I am, I feel I have
to help the staff get paid.

09:08.944 --> 09:11.384
And I have an idea of just how to do it.

09:11.384 --> 09:13.084
I'm gonna hire a team
of white glove movers

09:13.084 --> 09:15.138
to assemble all of Robert's
most valuable antiques

09:15.138 --> 09:18.058
from the storage units, the
basement and around the Inn.

09:18.965 --> 09:21.728
I'm hoping when confronted
with all the money he's wasted,

09:21.728 --> 09:24.356
I can convince Robert to sell
some of his vast collection

09:24.356 --> 09:25.547
to pay his staff.

09:30.525 --> 09:31.488
(tense music)

09:31.488 --> 09:32.645
If this is going to work,

09:32.645 --> 09:34.765
I must stay calm while I talk to Robert.

09:36.628 --> 09:39.808
I've come back, not for
you but for the staff.

09:39.808 --> 09:40.851
They deserve better.

09:43.010 --> 09:46.795
We're losing on average
$15,000 to $20,000 a month

09:46.795 --> 09:48.987
and we are short,

09:49.985 --> 09:52.165
but you have a serious hobby of

09:52.165 --> 09:53.814
sort of an art collector, an art dealer.

09:53.814 --> 09:55.282
I mean, you could open a museum.

09:55.282 --> 09:56.252
How many pieces do you have in there?

09:56.252 --> 09:57.764
- Oh my god. Hundreds.

09:57.764 --> 10:00.694
- What are we talking
about? I mean, collectively?

10:00.694 --> 10:03.468
All those beautiful oil
paintings, the expensive stuff?

10:03.468 --> 10:06.957
- At a suitable auction
it may be $300,000.

10:08.607 --> 10:09.476
- $300,000.

10:09.476 --> 10:11.684
And that would supplement you for the next

10:11.684 --> 10:13.206
12 months, 18 months?

10:13.206 --> 10:16.533
- Yes, that would
certainly get us through.

10:16.533 --> 10:18.629
That would get us through two years.

10:18.629 --> 10:20.870
- Right. There's something
I want you to see.

10:20.870 --> 10:22.977
I'd like you to come with me, please.

10:22.977 --> 10:25.490
If there's one thing we need right now,

10:25.490 --> 10:28.454
is an injection of funds.

10:30.964 --> 10:32.862
- Wow!
(bright music)

10:32.862 --> 10:36.292
- Robert, no man alive
needs this much stuff.

10:36.292 --> 10:38.513
- Walking in, it was shocking.

10:38.513 --> 10:43.727
- Now, antiques, oil
paintings, silverware.

10:43.987 --> 10:45.739
Does it not, I mean, frustrate you

10:45.739 --> 10:47.991
that we're sat with all this

10:47.991 --> 10:50.330
and yet we can't pay our staff properly?

10:51.703 --> 10:54.122
There's someone I'd like you to meet.

10:54.122 --> 10:56.802
She's the head auctioneer
at Bonham's in Boston.

10:56.802 --> 10:57.671
Amy, good morning.

10:57.671 --> 10:58.539
- Good morning, Gordon.

10:58.539 --> 10:59.409
- How nice to see you.

10:59.409 --> 11:00.759
- Gordon, great to see you.
- Likewise,

11:00.759 --> 11:01.932
thank you so much for coming.

11:01.932 --> 11:05.957
We're in the shit, basically,
and this stuff needs to go.

11:05.957 --> 11:08.116
We need to raise as
much money as possible,

11:08.116 --> 11:10.632
so what's the best price we
can get for all this stuff?

11:14.445 --> 11:17.469
- What you have here doesn't
read as a collection to me.

11:17.469 --> 11:18.994
It's kind of an accumulation.

11:19.936 --> 11:22.073
(tense music)
A lot of copies of things,

11:23.193 --> 11:26.498
or if they are of the period
that they're supposed to be

11:26.498 --> 11:28.066
there's some condition issues.

11:29.814 --> 11:30.683
Um...

11:35.841 --> 11:39.905
I would say about 25,000.

11:41.545 --> 11:42.577
- Say that again?

11:42.577 --> 11:45.118
- 25,000.

11:45.118 --> 11:45.987
- $25,000.

11:48.333 --> 11:49.574
All this?

11:49.574 --> 11:51.221
- All this.

11:51.221 --> 11:55.924
- Amy's opinion on our things was shocking

11:55.924 --> 11:58.580
and I can't really believe that.

11:58.580 --> 11:59.896
- And the painting?

11:59.896 --> 12:03.410
- The painting is a copy, and
not a good one, I'm afraid.

12:03.410 --> 12:04.279
- How much is that worth?

12:04.279 --> 12:05.923
- [Amy] I can't imagine what
someone would pay for it.

12:05.923 --> 12:07.967
It's really very low value.

12:07.967 --> 12:08.836
- Wow.

12:08.836 --> 12:11.940
Robert, I thought you said it
was expensive, 18th century?

12:11.940 --> 12:14.348
- Well, it's dated 17 something.

12:14.348 --> 12:18.707
- It is, but it's not actually
of that period at all.

12:18.707 --> 12:19.576
I'm sorry.

12:20.490 --> 12:21.887
- Did you know that was a copy?

12:21.887 --> 12:24.671
- I did not know that that was a copy.

12:24.671 --> 12:26.538
- Lots of copies.
- Reproductions.

12:26.538 --> 12:27.518
- Reproductions.

12:27.518 --> 12:30.417
We're hoping in the ball
park of three to $400,000.

12:30.417 --> 12:32.130
25 grand for everything?

12:33.241 --> 12:34.110
- Yeah.

12:34.110 --> 12:36.214
- That won't even get us
through the next five weeks.

12:36.214 --> 12:37.862
Even all this amazing silverware?

12:37.862 --> 12:39.923
- I put $100 on everything on this table.

12:39.923 --> 12:41.812
- $100? What about this?

12:41.812 --> 12:43.179
- This is first period. This is Sheffield.

12:43.179 --> 12:44.487
- Yeah, it's plate.

12:44.487 --> 12:46.433
- What about this?
- 175 bucks.

12:46.433 --> 12:48.111
- But those are Baccarat candlesticks.

12:48.111 --> 12:50.291
- They just don't bring very
much at auction, I'm afraid.

12:50.291 --> 12:51.159
- Is this the kind of collection

12:51.159 --> 12:52.480
that you'd be willing to sell at Bonham's?

12:52.480 --> 12:53.349
Would you take the whole lot?

12:53.349 --> 12:54.263
- No, we wouldn't.

12:54.263 --> 12:55.132
- Wow.

12:55.132 --> 12:57.080
- [Amy] We would have to say no.

12:57.080 --> 12:57.975
(gentle music)
- We're floating as if

12:57.975 --> 13:00.582
we've got this asset
full of three or $400,000

13:00.582 --> 13:01.479
worth of antiques.

13:01.479 --> 13:02.939
We haven't and we're distracted

13:02.939 --> 13:04.026
with the bits of crap in here.

13:04.026 --> 13:05.671
It's a wake up call.

13:05.671 --> 13:06.954
Thank you, that's a start.
- Sure.

13:06.954 --> 13:07.823
My pleasure.
I appreciate it.

13:07.823 --> 13:08.691
Thank you.

13:08.691 --> 13:11.176
- It means that we don't have

13:11.176 --> 13:13.230
the back-up that we thought we had.

13:13.230 --> 13:15.451
We've paid more money for fucking storage

13:15.451 --> 13:17.182
- Than they're worth.
- Than they're worth.

13:17.182 --> 13:19.236
Does that not bring it
home a little bit earlier

13:19.236 --> 13:21.687
that you need to be an innkeeper,

13:21.687 --> 13:24.637
not a part-time antiques dealer?

13:24.637 --> 13:26.733
Because you fooled me.

13:26.733 --> 13:28.190
You gave me the tour and I thought,

13:28.190 --> 13:32.489
"Wow, this guy has got
serious cash to burn."

13:32.489 --> 13:35.200
But right now we're
even further in the shit

13:35.200 --> 13:40.414
than I thought we were so
the pressure intensifies.

13:40.779 --> 13:42.345
- Yeah.
(dramatic music)

13:42.345 --> 13:43.563
- You need to focus on fixing the business

13:43.563 --> 13:46.253
'cause that's what's gonna
generate sufficient funds

13:46.253 --> 13:48.372
to keep this place open.

13:48.372 --> 13:51.397
And I don't think you quite
realise that your staff,

13:52.311 --> 13:53.249
they're miserable.

13:54.198 --> 13:56.461
They don't like Ari's barking

13:56.461 --> 13:58.849
- Excuse me. Excuse me.

13:58.849 --> 13:59.902
I am the boss.

13:59.902 --> 14:01.153
- [Gordon] You bitching.

14:01.153 --> 14:03.312
- When you're in your
fucking kitchen all day long

14:03.312 --> 14:05.011
and you're on the goddamn internet

14:05.011 --> 14:07.222
instead of actually
trying to perfect a menu.

14:07.222 --> 14:10.343
- It's not a nice atmosphere
for the staff currently.

14:12.112 --> 14:15.386
And if they quit, you're fucked.

14:15.386 --> 14:17.075
They are staff.

14:17.075 --> 14:19.734
They're not pigs that live
in the fucking basement.

14:21.079 --> 14:25.052
If you think that's not the
case and you're that delusional

14:25.052 --> 14:27.210
and you're not prepared to
listen to anything I'm saying,

14:27.210 --> 14:28.941
you're fucked!

14:28.941 --> 14:33.049
Sell the inn, sell this
shit in here, and give up.

14:33.049 --> 14:35.916
(dramatic music)

14:37.371 --> 14:39.891
(clattering)

14:41.154 --> 14:42.022
(dramatic music)
I've just come back

14:42.022 --> 14:43.967
to try and save Juniper Hill Inn,

14:43.967 --> 14:45.750
and I thought I could
use some of the owner's

14:45.750 --> 14:48.784
vast array of antiques
to get the cash flowing.

14:48.784 --> 14:50.400
But I just discovered...

14:50.400 --> 14:52.820
- I would say about 25,000.

14:52.820 --> 14:55.364
- $25,000. All this?

14:55.364 --> 14:57.095
- All this.

14:57.095 --> 14:58.679
- And I was wrong.

14:58.679 --> 15:01.279
That won't even get us
through the next five weeks.

15:02.506 --> 15:05.332
With no assets, the challenge
to make this place work

15:05.332 --> 15:06.573
is bigger than ever.

15:06.573 --> 15:09.339
Tomorrow, I have to start
the process of change.

15:11.616 --> 15:12.693
(gentle music)
Before I get stuck in

15:12.693 --> 15:14.362
there's one thing I want to try.

15:23.149 --> 15:24.017
Oh God.

15:26.239 --> 15:28.522
It's bloody roasting.

15:28.522 --> 15:30.475
Oh fuck. My feet are freezing now.

15:35.727 --> 15:36.595
Morning.

15:36.595 --> 15:39.262
Now it's time to see if I can
get through to Robert and Ari.

15:39.262 --> 15:40.721
Can I just borrow you for two minutes?

15:40.721 --> 15:41.590
I wanna show you something.

15:41.590 --> 15:42.459
- Yes.
- Both of you together.

15:42.459 --> 15:46.442
I'd like you to come up
to my room. Thank you.

15:46.442 --> 15:47.310
(tense music)
If this place

15:47.310 --> 15:48.281
is gonna work as a business,

15:48.281 --> 15:50.909
Robert and Ari need to
hear some home truths

15:50.909 --> 15:52.869
about how their paying
customers really feel

15:52.869 --> 15:54.172
about their precious Inn.

15:55.257 --> 15:56.515
Ladies and gentlemen, good morning.

15:56.515 --> 15:57.384
- [All] Good morning.

15:57.384 --> 15:59.725
- Thank you so much for
popping into my room.

15:59.725 --> 16:00.940
(chuckles)

16:00.940 --> 16:02.569
How was your stay last night?

16:02.569 --> 16:03.616
- Well, we didn't know where
to go when we walked in

16:03.616 --> 16:05.559
so we walked around and around

16:05.559 --> 16:07.436
until we found somebody
to help us check in.

16:07.436 --> 16:09.187
- I was slightly disorientated
when I checked in as well.

16:09.187 --> 16:11.106
I mean, there's no signs
in terms of Reception,

16:11.106 --> 16:13.567
Front Desk, or Bar, or Lounge or;

16:13.567 --> 16:15.068
how about the rooms?

16:15.068 --> 16:16.674
- I had space heaters to heat the room up.

16:16.674 --> 16:17.543
- Oh, really?

16:17.543 --> 16:18.411
- Yeah. Three of them.

16:18.411 --> 16:20.490
- When I checked the
room, it was like a sauna.

16:20.490 --> 16:22.409
- He sounds aggravated.

16:22.409 --> 16:24.950
- Raise your hands if
you'd come back, please.

16:24.950 --> 16:26.887
- Not like it is.

16:26.887 --> 16:28.790
- Not like it is.

16:28.790 --> 16:29.875
There's someone i'd like to hear from

16:29.875 --> 16:31.314
who hasn't said anything yet.

16:31.314 --> 16:33.722
He is a lead inspector
of the Diamond Collection

16:33.722 --> 16:35.704
of hotels and inns that cross America.

16:36.681 --> 16:37.799
In a nutshell?

16:37.799 --> 16:39.509
- Very disappointed.

16:39.509 --> 16:41.313
Didn't meet expectations.

16:41.313 --> 16:43.899
From the moment I walked
in, with no greeting,

16:43.899 --> 16:46.631
no check-in area, I was totally lost.

16:46.631 --> 16:47.500
And the bar's a joke.

16:47.500 --> 16:49.791
It should not even be there, folks.

16:49.791 --> 16:51.897
It looks as if it's set up for a wedding.

16:51.897 --> 16:54.976
The hospitality is nice,
but everything else fails.

16:57.020 --> 16:57.924
(tense music)
- How do you feel?

16:57.924 --> 17:00.311
- I don't want my guests
to have that experience.

17:00.311 --> 17:02.261
You know, our goal is to please people,

17:02.261 --> 17:03.940
that's why we're in the inn business,

17:03.940 --> 17:06.320
and we've obviously fallen really short.

17:07.423 --> 17:08.872
- For me, I think that's
positive feedback,

17:08.872 --> 17:10.634
so I'm grateful, and
entirely, let me tell you,

17:10.634 --> 17:11.502
thank you all.

17:11.502 --> 17:13.262
Can I keep you two
here, please? Thank you.

17:13.262 --> 17:16.286
The guest feedback has
certainly been constructive.

17:16.286 --> 17:17.272
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

17:17.272 --> 17:18.339
And Robert's even using a word

17:18.339 --> 17:19.852
I've never heard from him before.

17:19.852 --> 17:20.853
- [Robert] We are sorry.

17:20.853 --> 17:23.699
- But I'm shocked by Ari's
response to the guest complaints.

17:23.699 --> 17:25.107
What's the matter with you?

17:26.056 --> 17:27.578
Why are you so angry with guests?

17:27.578 --> 17:30.644
Why are you running an
inn when you're so bitter?

17:30.644 --> 17:32.521
You look like you don't give a shit.

17:33.480 --> 17:34.971
- I'm not saying that
I don't like the guests

17:34.971 --> 17:39.715
but if you have ever been
an innkeeper it's 24/7.

17:39.715 --> 17:43.928
- No-one is more touched
by what these people said.

17:43.928 --> 17:45.544
- Well, Ari isn't, clearly,

17:45.544 --> 17:46.413
that's a-
- I mean...

17:46.413 --> 17:48.912
- I would love this to
be our private home.

17:48.912 --> 17:50.591
- But I am.
- It's a lost cause.

17:50.591 --> 17:52.562
- And Ari does have a different way

17:52.562 --> 17:54.428
of dealing with things.
- Sure, I see that.

17:54.428 --> 17:55.828
Based on my experience,

17:56.826 --> 18:01.446
I would seriously request
both of you actually sit down

18:01.446 --> 18:04.334
and reconsider whether you
should be in this business,

18:04.334 --> 18:05.202
going forward.

18:11.736 --> 18:12.605
(gentle music)
It's clear to me

18:12.605 --> 18:15.345
that Ari isn't cut out for
the hospitality business.

18:15.345 --> 18:17.222
And even though Robert now understands

18:17.222 --> 18:18.487
how he's let down his guests,
(people chattering)

18:18.487 --> 18:21.257
he's needs to understand that
he's also let down his staff

18:21.257 --> 18:23.572
and failed to recognise their potential.

18:23.572 --> 18:24.792
I've got a plan that will help Robert

18:24.792 --> 18:26.033
to see what he's doing wrong

18:26.033 --> 18:28.928
and how he can fix things in his kitchen.

18:28.928 --> 18:30.086
(door slams)

18:30.086 --> 18:30.954
(dramatic music)
(pan clatters)

18:30.954 --> 18:32.414
I've asked hef Giulian
to cook three dishes

18:32.414 --> 18:34.072
from Robert's expensive old menu

18:34.072 --> 18:36.481
and three new dishes of
his very own creation.

18:36.481 --> 18:37.377
Once he's finished,

18:37.377 --> 18:39.160
we're gonna pretend I cooked the new ones

18:39.160 --> 18:40.297
and see what Robert says.

18:40.297 --> 18:41.767
Crucially, Giulian's dishes

18:41.767 --> 18:44.033
are ones that can be served on a $29 menu,

18:44.033 --> 18:46.424
half of what Robert currently charges.

18:46.424 --> 18:47.292
Look at that.

18:47.292 --> 18:49.400
$74, $29.

18:49.400 --> 18:50.411
Let's go.

18:50.411 --> 18:51.621
Good luck.

18:51.621 --> 18:53.174
Okay?
- Yes.

18:53.174 --> 18:54.043
(gentle music)

18:54.043 --> 18:55.155
- I can't wait to see what Robert thinks

18:55.155 --> 18:58.054
of Giulian's affordable food
when he thinks I've cooked it.

18:58.054 --> 19:01.391
I asked him to cook a
three-course meal, yeah?

19:01.391 --> 19:04.811
He cooked his lamb, his
crab cake and the dessert.

19:04.811 --> 19:06.886
That's the $74 version.

19:06.886 --> 19:08.554
I cooked the other meal.

19:08.554 --> 19:10.629
I got hold of some chicken, some sprouts,

19:10.629 --> 19:11.641
and I used the crab,

19:11.641 --> 19:14.463
and a butterscotch pudding
with some caramelised popcorn.

19:14.463 --> 19:18.377
$29. That's what those three
courses are gonna cost.

19:18.377 --> 19:19.245
- Okay.

19:19.245 --> 19:20.114
- Giulian's three new dishes

19:20.114 --> 19:21.911
are fantastic and fairly priced.

19:21.911 --> 19:23.778
That would go a long way
towards bringing guests

19:23.778 --> 19:24.914
back through the front door.

19:24.914 --> 19:26.687
Now that Robert thinks I've cooked them,

19:26.687 --> 19:28.074
I bet he loves them.

19:28.074 --> 19:29.422
Talk to me.
- Excellent.

19:30.858 --> 19:31.726
Fabulous.

19:31.726 --> 19:33.684
And the Brussels sprouts
are really good too.

19:33.684 --> 19:36.916
You've actually leafed
them and it's very pretty.

19:36.916 --> 19:38.480
Now this is much better value.

19:39.909 --> 19:42.797
- I've never heard you
use that word value.

19:42.797 --> 19:46.241
And we could get two for the price of one.

19:47.249 --> 19:48.573
- It's what we should do.

19:48.573 --> 19:50.867
- So my menu or Giulian's menu?

19:50.867 --> 19:51.736
- Your menu.

19:51.736 --> 19:52.890
- My menu?

19:52.890 --> 19:56.027
I'm flattered, but there's
something I need to tell you.

19:56.027 --> 19:58.790
I didn't make any of this.
Giulian cooked everything.

20:00.638 --> 20:04.120
- I felt at that very moment

20:04.120 --> 20:06.588
that I had done Giulian a disservice.

20:06.588 --> 20:08.051
(soft music)
- Robert,

20:08.051 --> 20:10.710
have you got something you'd like to say

20:10.710 --> 20:12.055
to your chef Giulian?

20:12.055 --> 20:13.661
- I'm sorry that I haven't
given you the freedom

20:13.661 --> 20:15.051
to do what you need to do.

20:17.238 --> 20:20.001
I guess I have to eat it and say that

20:20.001 --> 20:23.390
I have restricted him
from being who he can be,

20:23.390 --> 20:26.841
which is really difficult.

20:26.841 --> 20:31.495
And I have to say that this is delicious.

20:35.005 --> 20:35.874
- Coming up.

20:35.874 --> 20:37.039
- He's emotionally constipated.

20:37.039 --> 20:38.561
- [Gordon] Robert has a major decision

20:38.561 --> 20:40.365
about his future with Ari.

20:40.365 --> 20:42.491
- I think he gave up.

20:42.491 --> 20:43.570
(door clunks)

20:43.570 --> 20:45.217
(clattering)

20:45.217 --> 20:46.085
(tense music)

20:46.085 --> 20:47.747
- [Gordon] Now that owner
Robert's heard from the guests,

20:47.747 --> 20:50.928
- Very disappointed.
Didn't meet expectations.

20:50.928 --> 20:52.450
- [Gordon] And sampled
the kind of affordable,

20:52.450 --> 20:55.307
high quality food his chef can
cook when given the chance,

20:55.307 --> 20:57.865
- Excellent, fine meals.
- I didn't make any of this.

20:57.865 --> 20:59.387
Giulian cooked everything.

21:00.427 --> 21:03.784
I hope this has all started
to sink in with him.

21:03.784 --> 21:05.098
Well, how are you feeling?
(dramatic music)

21:05.098 --> 21:06.266
- I'm feeling all sorts of things.

21:06.266 --> 21:09.279
I mean, there's, of course, fear.

21:09.279 --> 21:10.614
- [Gordon] But surely hope too?

21:10.614 --> 21:12.188
Your chef's food was amazing.

21:12.188 --> 21:13.057
- Absolutely.

21:14.639 --> 21:15.890
It was an epiphany.

21:15.890 --> 21:20.457
I feel regretful that I have come across

21:20.457 --> 21:22.115
in the way that I have,
(soft music)

21:22.115 --> 21:24.576
and that I haven't exhibited to my staff

21:24.576 --> 21:28.872
the leadership they
needed and the compassion

21:28.872 --> 21:33.512
that apparently I must be void of.

21:33.512 --> 21:36.275
- I think for you to tell
them how you're feeling,

21:36.275 --> 21:37.829
what you're gonna commit to,

21:37.829 --> 21:39.726
how important they are for you.

21:39.726 --> 21:42.177
- I know that this place
wouldn't be here without them

21:42.177 --> 21:45.023
and I'm wanting to do everything I can

21:45.023 --> 21:47.956
to show them that we can make this work.

21:50.654 --> 21:52.416
- I'm glad Robert's on a new path.

21:52.416 --> 21:53.949
I just hope it's not
too late for his staff

21:53.949 --> 21:55.482
to learn to trust him again.
(gentle music)

21:55.482 --> 21:59.715
- You are all valuable to me,

21:59.715 --> 22:03.010
and to Ari, and to Juniper Hill,

22:03.010 --> 22:08.224
and I fear that we have
not always expressed that,

22:08.463 --> 22:12.405
and we want to show you that we are

22:12.405 --> 22:13.812
going to make a difference.

22:14.970 --> 22:16.975
Sorry for your pay checks being late.

22:19.370 --> 22:23.513
Sorry for taking part of the tips.

22:24.573 --> 22:29.297
Sorry for not communicating,
because that was the reality,

22:29.297 --> 22:33.353
and one that I'm not proud
of, that we're not proud of,

22:33.353 --> 22:35.751
but one that we certainly can correct,

22:35.751 --> 22:37.211
and that's what we wanna do.

22:38.181 --> 22:39.693
- The business is short of cash flow.

22:39.693 --> 22:41.788
I thought there was a
substantial collection

22:41.788 --> 22:46.376
of three to $400,000-worth of assets.

22:46.376 --> 22:48.796
I mean, why don't you explain exactly?

22:48.796 --> 22:49.665
(tense music)
- In the things that were

22:49.665 --> 22:54.346
assembled here, they said
lucky if we got 25,000.

22:57.711 --> 22:59.942
- We are on our arse, it
is gonna be difficult,

22:59.942 --> 23:04.450
and I think Robert has
realised the bubble's burst,

23:05.583 --> 23:08.568
and he understands the
truth to where we are.

23:09.860 --> 23:10.729
(gentle music)
- I think there's a perception

23:10.729 --> 23:13.028
that we are these wealthy
magnates coming in

23:13.028 --> 23:16.000
and lord of the manor sort of things.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.191
That's not who we are.

23:18.930 --> 23:22.756
- You know, I knew there
were some bad situations here

23:22.756 --> 23:26.573
but I stayed because I wanna
be here and I want to help him,

23:26.573 --> 23:28.210
and I believe what he says.

23:28.210 --> 23:29.816
- And I'm very proud of you, Robert.

23:29.816 --> 23:32.610
You're the man that I've
always known and loved,

23:32.610 --> 23:33.872
he's coming back.

23:33.872 --> 23:36.499
- I'm glad to see that, you
know, we're facing facts

23:36.499 --> 23:39.252
and that's the only way
we're gonna get out of this.

23:39.252 --> 23:40.465
- Agreed. Thank you.

23:41.410 --> 23:44.038
- Ryan. What do you think
of what Robert's just said?

23:44.038 --> 23:45.571
- I wanted to stand up and clap.

23:45.571 --> 23:46.930
- [Barbara] I did, too.

23:46.930 --> 23:47.834
(laughing)
(upbeat music)

23:47.834 --> 23:49.888
- I feel like I'm working for somebody

23:49.888 --> 23:51.003
who can actually run a business,

23:51.003 --> 23:54.027
when I hear things like
that, that can succeed.

23:54.027 --> 23:56.373
I've never seen Robert so serious.

23:56.373 --> 23:59.074
This is actually really a
life changing thing for him

23:59.074 --> 24:01.556
and I feel like I want to
be part of the changes.

24:01.556 --> 24:02.424
- Thank you.

24:02.424 --> 24:03.496
Yes.
- Thank you.

24:03.496 --> 24:04.507
- Thank you, Gordon.
- The truth's important.

24:04.507 --> 24:06.581
- It's humbling to have to admit

24:06.581 --> 24:08.834
some of the things that
haven't gone right,

24:08.834 --> 24:11.722
but at the same time it's
energising to see that people

24:11.722 --> 24:15.580
really do care for us and
care for Juniper Hill.

24:15.580 --> 24:18.382
That is what's gonna make us successful.

24:18.382 --> 24:19.584
(bright music)
- I'm impressed with the way

24:19.584 --> 24:21.252
Robert dealt with the staff meeting.

24:21.252 --> 24:23.505
I've got real ope that he
can make this place work,

24:23.505 --> 24:25.225
but he has another lesson to learn.

24:25.225 --> 24:27.217
He thinks people aren't
spending money at Juniper Hill

24:27.217 --> 24:28.218
because of the recession,

24:28.218 --> 24:29.844
but I think it's the snobbish atmosphere

24:29.844 --> 24:32.097
and the high prices that
have kept people away.

24:32.097 --> 24:34.714
I'm taking Robert to a
fantastic local brewery

24:34.714 --> 24:36.194
to show him how a warm welcome

24:36.194 --> 24:38.103
can translate into money in the bank.

24:38.103 --> 24:40.793
Let's go and have a beer.
Let's get in with the locals.

24:40.793 --> 24:42.193
Trust me, they won't beat you up.

24:42.193 --> 24:43.357
(laughs)

24:43.357 --> 24:46.747
(upbeat music)
(people chatter)

24:46.747 --> 24:49.239
You are like a fish
out of water right now.

24:49.239 --> 24:50.365
Honestly.

24:50.365 --> 24:52.054
You're like a vegetarian in the middle of

24:52.054 --> 24:53.305
a big steak tartare.

24:53.305 --> 24:54.557
Look at you.
(laughs)

24:54.557 --> 24:57.174
- No, no. I love the
people from our region.

24:57.174 --> 24:59.593
The upper valley is filled
with amazing people.

24:59.593 --> 25:01.261
- But Juniper Hill is not

25:01.261 --> 25:02.784
- I know.
- Filled with local people.

25:02.784 --> 25:04.319
Wouldn't you welcome this atmosphere?

25:04.319 --> 25:05.787
- Oh, oh yeah.

25:05.787 --> 25:07.267
- In your stately house?

25:07.267 --> 25:09.154
- Absolutely. Everyone is welcome.

25:09.154 --> 25:12.533
- Stand on there and tell
them you need them. Off we go.

25:12.533 --> 25:14.889
- If I could have your attention, please!

25:14.889 --> 25:18.914
I'm Robert, I'm the innkeeper
at Juniper Hill Inn.

25:18.914 --> 25:22.032
We just wanna tell everybody
we'd love to have you all

25:22.032 --> 25:25.921
up at Juniper Hill Inn and
we need the help right now,

25:25.921 --> 25:28.288
so, if you can come up and have dinner,

25:28.288 --> 25:31.333
or just have a drink and just
say hi, it would be great.

25:31.333 --> 25:32.598
Thank you.

25:32.598 --> 25:33.616
(applause)

25:33.616 --> 25:35.347
- Nice. Well done.

25:35.347 --> 25:37.620
If Robert can always be
that inviting to the locals

25:37.620 --> 25:39.894
he surely has it in him to
be the leader of the Inn.

25:39.894 --> 25:42.323
When was the last time you
brought Ari here for a beer?

25:42.323 --> 25:45.333
- We haven't been here
probably in six months.

25:45.333 --> 25:46.202
(gentle music)
- How was he,

25:46.202 --> 25:48.590
after you spoke to the team like that?

25:48.590 --> 25:51.874
- You know, the interesting
thing with Ari is,

25:51.874 --> 25:53.991
his exterior is Finnish.

25:53.991 --> 25:54.992
You know, he's very-

25:54.992 --> 25:57.244
- Stern.
- Stern.

25:57.244 --> 25:58.506
But he feels deeply.

25:58.506 --> 25:59.736
- He can't express it, though, can he?

25:59.736 --> 26:02.500
- He can't. He's emotionally constipated.

26:02.500 --> 26:03.803
I think he gave up.

26:03.803 --> 26:05.492
- That can't come across to the staff,

26:05.492 --> 26:07.598
that can't come across to the customers,

26:07.598 --> 26:10.633
so you've gotta almost
isolate yourself from that.

26:10.633 --> 26:11.863
- But he's getting through it.

26:11.863 --> 26:13.292
- But he's not gonna be the face,

26:13.292 --> 26:14.160
he's not gonna be the innkeeper.

26:14.160 --> 26:15.241
- No, he's not.

26:15.241 --> 26:17.254
- But he can provide a phenomenal amount

26:17.254 --> 26:19.444
of support behind the scenes.

26:19.444 --> 26:21.769
- Cheers to that.
(glasses clink)

26:21.769 --> 26:23.635
- Coming up.
- It's fantastic.

26:23.635 --> 26:26.221
- [Gordon] I show off the new
and improved Juniper Hill Inn.

26:26.221 --> 26:28.765
- Oh my goodness! Look at this!

26:28.765 --> 26:30.757
- [Gordon] But assistant
innkeeper Sara's joy

26:30.757 --> 26:32.623
is short lived.
- I'll be in my room.

26:32.623 --> 26:33.492
- You look terrible. What's the matter?

26:33.492 --> 26:35.526
- I'm sick of it, Gordon.

26:35.526 --> 26:37.898
(dramatic music)

26:37.898 --> 26:40.695
(clattering)
(fizzing neon)

26:40.695 --> 26:41.685
(tense music)
- It's been a tough week

26:41.685 --> 26:43.019
here at Juniper Hill Inn,

26:43.019 --> 26:45.490
and owner Robert's pompous
ways have been maddening.

26:45.490 --> 26:47.816
- I don't have a secretary,
Gordon. I'm sorry.

26:47.816 --> 26:50.175
- Are you always this pathetic?

26:51.100 --> 26:52.581
But he's finally come off his pedestal

26:52.581 --> 26:54.301
thinking on the same level as his team.

26:54.301 --> 26:57.638
- You are all valuable to Juniper Hill

26:57.638 --> 27:00.693
and we want to show you that we are

27:00.693 --> 27:02.101
going to make a difference.

27:03.967 --> 27:05.354
- Overnight, my team has been working

27:05.354 --> 27:06.949
on a remarkable transformation,

27:06.949 --> 27:08.211
and with relaunch upon us,

27:08.211 --> 27:10.625
it's a chance for a
fresh start for everyone.

27:10.625 --> 27:11.493
Morning!

27:11.493 --> 27:12.362
- [All] Good morning.

27:12.362 --> 27:15.875
- Let me introduce you to
the new Juniper Hill Inn.

27:15.875 --> 27:19.577
It's no longer a hangout
for the super rich

27:19.577 --> 27:21.714
or your mates getting freebies, yeah?

27:21.714 --> 27:25.489
It's now a nice warm and
very welcoming country inn.

27:25.489 --> 27:27.605
And trust me, everyone is welcome,

27:27.605 --> 27:30.191
whether you're driving
up here in a Mercedes

27:30.191 --> 27:31.398
or even a pickup truck.

27:31.398 --> 27:33.081
(laughs)

27:33.081 --> 27:33.949
You ready?

27:33.949 --> 27:34.818
- Yes.
- Yes, we are.

27:34.818 --> 27:36.093
- Let's go. Let's go, let's go, let's go.

27:36.093 --> 27:37.522
- Let's go.
(bright music)

27:37.522 --> 27:38.408
- Please come in.

27:39.565 --> 27:40.434
Come through.

27:40.434 --> 27:41.880
The Great Hall is a beautiful room

27:41.880 --> 27:43.976
but it was hidden by vast
amounts of furniture.

27:43.976 --> 27:46.082
- Oh, my goodness. Look at this.

27:46.082 --> 27:47.719
- [Gordon] My team have
edited the collection

27:47.719 --> 27:49.700
and created a feeling
of comfort and space.

27:49.700 --> 27:51.650
- When I walked in to the Great Hall,

27:51.650 --> 27:53.371
it felt like a different room.

27:53.371 --> 27:56.363
Gordon put together this amazing place.

27:56.363 --> 27:58.407
It feels comfortable and warm.

27:58.407 --> 28:03.089
- You have a spacious,
gracious, warm reception room.

28:03.089 --> 28:08.122
Look at it! Gone is that
hideous makeshift bar.

28:08.122 --> 28:09.221
- Yay!
(cheers)

28:09.221 --> 28:10.725
(applause)
Gone!

28:10.725 --> 28:14.527
Guests know where to go
because they have proper signs.

28:14.527 --> 28:15.737
Ready to see the dining room?

28:15.737 --> 28:16.698
- [All] Yes.

28:16.698 --> 28:17.976
(applause)
- Come through.

28:17.976 --> 28:20.445
(bright music)
It's warm and welcoming.

28:20.445 --> 28:21.941
- [Staff Member] Oh, I love this.

28:21.941 --> 28:23.880
- No longer feels like
your grandmother's parlour.

28:23.880 --> 28:25.173
It really is a dining room.

28:25.173 --> 28:26.883
It's what you'd expect from
a country inn, you know,

28:26.883 --> 28:28.302
it has an identity.
- Right.

28:28.302 --> 28:29.574
- Gone are those hideous sofas

28:29.574 --> 28:31.597
that nobody could sit and eat dinner in.

28:31.597 --> 28:32.796
Ari, what do you think?

28:32.796 --> 28:34.714
- Very nice, very nice.
- You like it?

28:34.714 --> 28:36.529
- Very open.
- Excellent.

28:36.529 --> 28:38.134
I'm gonna show you my bedroom.

28:38.134 --> 28:39.125
Please.

28:39.125 --> 28:41.002
Everybody else can come too, please.

28:42.349 --> 28:43.332
You ready?

28:43.332 --> 28:44.494
- [All] We're ready.

28:44.494 --> 28:45.536
- In you go.

28:48.963 --> 28:53.139
Do you know what's wrong
with this room? Nothing.

28:53.139 --> 28:54.949
You don't need to do anything to them.

28:54.949 --> 28:56.809
The only thing wrong
was the smell in Room 1,

28:56.809 --> 28:58.707
and a plumber's taken care of that.

28:58.707 --> 29:02.784
The guest rooms are the
absolute highlight of your inn.

29:02.784 --> 29:04.192
- That meant something 'cause it meant

29:04.192 --> 29:05.182
we were on the right track.

29:05.182 --> 29:08.133
We just needed better directions.

29:08.133 --> 29:13.274
- Now, the key to filling this
is to charge sensible prices.

29:13.274 --> 29:15.901
I would rather have the room sold

29:15.901 --> 29:16.770
at a cheaper price
. Absolutely.

29:16.770 --> 29:20.680
And have an 85% occupancy
rate across the year.

29:20.680 --> 29:23.179
Keep the prices down, fill it,

29:23.179 --> 29:25.338
let them enjoy this quality inn.

29:25.338 --> 29:27.548
The stunning bedrooms didn't need changing

29:27.548 --> 29:29.905
but there's one room that did
need a significant overhaul

29:29.905 --> 29:31.869
in order to bring in
much needed cash flow.

29:31.869 --> 29:32.738
(gentle music)
Now,

29:32.738 --> 29:35.035
there's one more little thing
I wanna show you downstairs.

29:35.035 --> 29:36.099
- Okay.
(chuckles)

29:36.099 --> 29:37.287
- You ready?
- I'm ready.

29:37.287 --> 29:38.547
- Let's go. Come with me.

29:38.547 --> 29:39.456
(upbeat music)

29:39.456 --> 29:44.670
Okay? We need to attract
the local community.

29:44.795 --> 29:48.415
I'd like to welcome you to the Blue Bar.

29:48.415 --> 29:49.883
- Oh!
- Blue Bar!

29:49.883 --> 29:51.065
- Cool!

29:51.065 --> 29:53.063
- Look at this leather.

29:54.112 --> 29:55.502
Oh, my goodness.

29:56.880 --> 29:58.715
Ari, aren't you thrilled?

29:58.715 --> 30:01.885
- [Gordon] The best new
local bar in Windsor.

30:01.885 --> 30:02.753
- Fantastic.

30:02.753 --> 30:04.061
- This is so great.

30:04.061 --> 30:05.750
Walk in and seeing the
people sitting there

30:05.750 --> 30:09.642
and the games on the tables
and the beautiful drinks,

30:09.642 --> 30:11.300
it was very emotional.

30:11.300 --> 30:13.031
I loved it.

30:13.031 --> 30:15.565
- The Blue Bar is exactly what
the town of Windsor, Vermont

30:15.565 --> 30:17.275
and Juniper Hill Inn need.

30:17.275 --> 30:18.860
I'm hoping it'll be popular,

30:18.860 --> 30:21.071
especially on a day like
today when the inn hosts

30:21.071 --> 30:23.260
its first ever Sunday lunch service.

30:23.260 --> 30:24.258
The staff are all getting ready

30:24.258 --> 30:26.274
for the arrival of their lunch guests.

30:26.274 --> 30:29.006
Five, six, seven, eight. So
you've got four tables each.

30:29.006 --> 30:30.851
- But while everybody else is busy,

30:30.851 --> 30:32.770
Ari seems lost and needs
reminding of his role

30:32.770 --> 30:34.344
here at the Inn.

30:34.344 --> 30:35.213
- I'm here.

30:35.213 --> 30:37.858
- Ah, Jesus. Right okay.

30:37.858 --> 30:38.727
- Had to go the other way.

30:38.727 --> 30:39.996
- Are you in, are you out,

30:39.996 --> 30:41.529
are you doing the checks,
what are you doing?

30:41.529 --> 30:43.124
- I was checking in people.

30:43.124 --> 30:43.992
- You're checking in.

30:43.992 --> 30:45.136
but I thought that was the,

30:45.136 --> 30:46.544
I thought you were checking in people?

30:46.544 --> 30:48.004
- You wanna check them
in and take them up?

30:48.004 --> 30:48.872
That'd be great.
- Shut up, no.

30:48.872 --> 30:50.193
Would you be so kind, just two seconds?

30:50.193 --> 30:51.062
I'm so sorry.

30:51.062 --> 30:51.931
Would you continue that?
- Of course.

30:51.931 --> 30:52.799
- Can I just have you for 30 seconds?

30:52.799 --> 30:53.668
- Yeah.
- Come this way.

30:53.668 --> 30:54.536
I thought you were gonna leave

30:54.536 --> 30:56.489
the front of the house to Robert?

30:56.489 --> 30:58.327
I thought you were gonna be
at the back of the house?

30:58.327 --> 31:00.930
- No, but thing is that Robert
asked me to check in people

31:00.930 --> 31:05.193
because he had to take
people to the dining room.

31:05.193 --> 31:08.149
- Yeah, I know, but, we
have a saying in England.

31:08.149 --> 31:09.119
- Yes.
- Too many chefs

31:09.119 --> 31:10.161
spoil the broth.
(dramatic music)

31:10.161 --> 31:11.778
You're not a natural innkeeper.

31:14.645 --> 31:15.966
- Oh, ok, ok.

31:15.966 --> 31:16.835
(gentle music)
- He needs your help.

31:16.835 --> 31:17.950
- Yes, yes.
- But behind the scenes.

31:17.950 --> 31:18.819
- Yes.

31:18.819 --> 31:20.411
- Explain to Robert that
you're gonna support him

31:20.411 --> 31:21.443
from behind the scenes.

31:21.443 --> 31:22.312
- Yes
- Please?

31:22.312 --> 31:23.181
- Sure.

31:23.181 --> 31:24.049
- Please?
- I will do that.

31:24.049 --> 31:25.760
- [Gordon] I think Ari has
finally got the picture

31:25.760 --> 31:28.304
and understands that he needs
to play to his strengths.

31:28.304 --> 31:31.254
I really hope that things
can continue to improve now.

31:31.254 --> 31:32.517
(dog yaps)

31:32.517 --> 31:33.706
- Come on, Sophie.

31:33.706 --> 31:36.374
We'd better remove the dog.
She's gonna eat the food.

31:36.374 --> 31:37.866
(dog yaps)
Sophie, our poodle,

31:37.866 --> 31:38.735
she shouldn't be in there.

31:38.735 --> 31:40.389
I mean, it's a place where we eat.

31:40.389 --> 31:41.828
Come on, Sophie.
(tense music)

31:41.828 --> 31:43.351
Come on, come, come.

31:43.351 --> 31:44.676
It's not for you. Come on.

31:44.676 --> 31:45.703
Come on, come on.

31:45.703 --> 31:46.572
Come on, honey.

31:46.572 --> 31:47.522
- Excuse me.
- Come on, come on.

31:47.522 --> 31:49.315
- I take care of the dog, okay?

31:49.315 --> 31:50.184
Excuse me!

31:50.184 --> 31:51.286
- The dog shouldn't be in the bar.

31:51.286 --> 31:53.277
He's on the seats eating the food.

31:53.277 --> 31:55.790
- Really? I am the boss, okay?

31:55.790 --> 31:58.136
- Don't ever talk to me that way again.

31:58.136 --> 31:59.158
- Excuse me!

31:59.158 --> 32:00.694
- Don't ever, and I mean it.

32:01.567 --> 32:04.278
I'll be in my room and I
don't need to be yelled at.

32:07.274 --> 32:10.180
(pattering feet)

32:10.180 --> 32:12.307
(bright music)

32:12.307 --> 32:13.756
- I'm coming towards the end of my stay

32:13.756 --> 32:15.362
at Vermont's Juniper Hill Inn,

32:15.362 --> 32:17.249
and I thought we'd turned the corner.

32:17.249 --> 32:20.106
But as the Inn's first ever
Sunday lunch service approaches,

32:20.106 --> 32:22.567
assistant innkeeper,
Sara, has gone missing.

32:22.567 --> 32:24.048
Where's Sara gone?

32:24.048 --> 32:26.206
- [Ryan] I haven't seen
Sara in about half an hour.

32:26.206 --> 32:27.885
- Is she okay?

32:27.885 --> 32:28.907
- I don't know.

32:28.907 --> 32:31.023
- You don't know. Okay, just asking.

32:31.023 --> 32:31.892
Has Sara gone home?

32:31.892 --> 32:33.411
- What?
- Has Sara gone home?

32:33.411 --> 32:34.944
- I don't know.
- No?

32:34.944 --> 32:36.748
The team can't afford to be a man down.

32:36.748 --> 32:37.846
I've got to find her.

32:39.302 --> 32:40.408
(knocks on door)
- Who is it?

32:40.408 --> 32:41.461
- It's me, Sara, it's Gordon.

32:41.461 --> 32:43.216
- [Sara] Oh, hi Gordon.

32:43.216 --> 32:44.364
- Are you okay?

32:44.364 --> 32:45.232
- [Sara] Oh, no.

32:45.232 --> 32:46.326
- What?
(tense music)

32:46.326 --> 32:48.191
- Hold on a second.
- Dear, oh dear.

32:48.191 --> 32:50.355
Darling, I thought you
were joining us for lunch?

32:50.355 --> 32:52.175
- Oh, thanks, I'm not going to.

32:52.175 --> 32:53.567
- What's the matter?

32:53.567 --> 32:54.620
- You wanna come in?

32:54.620 --> 32:56.351
- Yeah, you look terrible.
What's the matter?

32:56.351 --> 32:58.303
- Oh, I'm just really upset.

32:58.303 --> 32:59.171
- You don't wanna get upset.

32:59.171 --> 33:00.668
You were with us half an hour ago.

33:00.668 --> 33:01.763
The customers are in the bar.

33:01.763 --> 33:02.805
- I know-
- My first table's

33:02.805 --> 33:04.515
just arrived and I just
expect you to be there,

33:04.515 --> 33:06.434
in terms of, you're part of this team.

33:06.434 --> 33:08.717
- I know, but I'm sick of
being yelled at by Ari.

33:08.717 --> 33:10.062
I'm sick of it, Gordon.
(gentle music)

33:10.062 --> 33:11.178
- When did he yell at you?

33:11.178 --> 33:12.972
- Just a few minutes
ago because I asked him

33:12.972 --> 33:14.994
to take the dog out of the dining room.

33:14.994 --> 33:15.863
- Naturally.

33:15.863 --> 33:18.383
- It's his dog, and it's
sitting on the bar furniture.

33:18.383 --> 33:19.468
- Okay. Please come back down.

33:19.468 --> 33:21.824
- Oh, buck up and come down.

33:21.824 --> 33:23.931
Nobody's ever seen me break
down in tears in this inn.

33:23.931 --> 33:25.244
It's never happened before.

33:25.244 --> 33:26.204
- Just come back downstairs.

33:26.204 --> 33:27.072
- Okay.
- Please?

33:27.072 --> 33:28.185
- Yeah, I will, Gordon.
- Okay?

33:28.185 --> 33:30.343
- Yeah I wanna help the girls.
- I don't wanna see you upset.

33:30.343 --> 33:31.720
And the girls need you down there.

33:31.720 --> 33:34.691
- They do, and I'm just,
I'm just really mad at them.

33:34.691 --> 33:35.953
- Well, let me go and
have a word with Ari.

33:35.953 --> 33:37.684
This is ridiculous. Get yourself ready.

33:37.684 --> 33:39.686
The place is full of locals
and they'd love to see you too.

33:39.686 --> 33:41.239
- Okay.
- Please.

33:41.239 --> 33:42.897
And smiling, yes?
- Yes.

33:42.897 --> 33:45.053
Yes, I'll bounce back.

33:45.053 --> 33:45.921
(dramatic music)

33:45.921 --> 33:47.996
- I'm not sure why Ari
is snapping at his staff

33:47.996 --> 33:49.696
but it just proves my gut was right

33:49.696 --> 33:51.457
about his place being behind the scenes.

33:51.457 --> 33:52.932
(knocks on door)
Ari?

33:52.932 --> 33:54.294
(dog yaps)
- Yes?

33:54.294 --> 33:56.533
- I've just found Sara
upstairs in floods of tears.

33:56.533 --> 33:57.631
Everything okay?

33:57.631 --> 33:58.611
- No, we had a little run in

33:58.611 --> 34:00.874
because we both are very strong people.

34:00.874 --> 34:02.803
She snapped at me and I snapped back.

34:02.803 --> 34:04.336
- Do you think the dog should
be running around in the bar?

34:04.336 --> 34:05.889
- No. Not when there are guests.

34:05.889 --> 34:07.203
- So was she right or wrong?

34:07.203 --> 34:08.652
- She was right.

34:08.652 --> 34:10.175
- Would it be appropriate
for you to apologise to her?

34:10.175 --> 34:11.043
Do you feel that-
- Oh yeah, yeah.

34:11.043 --> 34:12.822
- You're responsible
from behind the scenes.

34:12.822 --> 34:14.054
Is there any way we could just,

34:14.054 --> 34:15.710
for this first Sunday lunch,
- Sure.

34:15.710 --> 34:16.994
- Try to keep the team together?

34:16.994 --> 34:18.464
- Okay.

34:18.464 --> 34:20.036
- I think Ari's heart
is in the right place

34:20.036 --> 34:22.447
but his tone is all
wrong for an innkeeper.

34:22.447 --> 34:24.670
He needs to be the
power behind the throne.

34:26.368 --> 34:27.237
I'm sure this is gonna be

34:27.237 --> 34:29.851
one of the busiest days
yet at Juniper Hill Inn

34:29.851 --> 34:31.300
and I need to remind Chef Giulian

34:31.300 --> 34:33.208
to make good use of his sous chef, Nita,

34:33.208 --> 34:35.418
if he's gonna have any
chance of being successful.

34:35.418 --> 34:37.744
Giulian's proved to Robert
and I that he has the talent

34:37.744 --> 34:39.266
and the potential in the kitchen.

34:39.266 --> 34:41.518
Now he just needs the help to execute.

34:41.518 --> 34:42.603
I know you're adamant with the fact

34:42.603 --> 34:43.510
that you're gonna work on your own,

34:43.510 --> 34:45.188
but you are not a one-man band.

34:45.188 --> 34:46.232
Yeah?
- Yes, chef.

34:46.232 --> 34:49.181
- Encourage, entice.
(dramatic music)

34:49.181 --> 34:50.799
Over to the stove.

34:50.799 --> 34:53.206
The local community have
responded to Robert's invitation

34:53.206 --> 34:55.501
and there's a great
atmosphere as people turn up

34:55.501 --> 34:57.920
to check out the bar
and sample the new menu

34:57.920 --> 34:59.662
I put together with Chef Giulian.

34:59.662 --> 35:00.864
- Tara, nice to see you.
- Hi!

35:00.864 --> 35:02.571
- Welcome to Juniper Hill.

35:02.571 --> 35:03.439
Hi, how are you, dear?

35:03.439 --> 35:04.308
- How are you?
- Nice to see you.

35:04.308 --> 35:05.772
- [Gordon] As well as new arrivals,

35:05.772 --> 35:09.067
the Inn has a return guest,
hotel inspector, Steve Tallon.

35:09.067 --> 35:11.486
His first visit was a disaster.

35:11.486 --> 35:14.823
- Very disappointed.
Didn't meet expectations.

35:14.823 --> 35:17.575
From the moment I walked
in, with no greeting,

35:17.575 --> 35:18.868
I was totally lost.

35:18.868 --> 35:20.140
- [Gordon] This is Robert
and his team's chance

35:20.140 --> 35:22.455
to prove to Steve that
they've learned their lesson.

35:22.455 --> 35:23.857
I hope this time they're flawless.

35:23.857 --> 35:25.646
- Hello there.
- Welcome back.

35:25.646 --> 35:27.898
- How are you, Mr.
Tallon? Nice to see you.

35:27.898 --> 35:29.177
- Nice to see you again.
- Welcome.

35:29.177 --> 35:31.175
So this is our new menu.

35:33.091 --> 35:34.738
- Okay, what's going next?
(tense music)

35:34.738 --> 35:36.459
- [Chef Giulian] Coming
up next we have one trout.

35:36.459 --> 35:38.252
- The key to this place running smoothly

35:38.252 --> 35:40.744
is communication among the entire staff,

35:40.744 --> 35:43.727
but Chef Giulian still
doesn't seem to get that.

35:43.727 --> 35:46.406
How long for the first
flat iron, please, Nita?

35:46.406 --> 35:48.492
- Medium rare.
- Medium rare.

35:48.492 --> 35:49.806
- Ask her, Giulian.

35:49.806 --> 35:50.674
- Medium rare?

35:53.059 --> 35:54.487
- Talk to Nita.

35:54.487 --> 35:56.468
I don't care what it's
about, the fucking weather,

35:56.468 --> 35:58.345
I don't care, but talk to her, okay?

35:59.534 --> 36:00.942
Come on. You've gotta talk.

36:03.455 --> 36:04.654
I just said, "come on."

36:06.155 --> 36:07.909
She can put things on a plate for you.

36:07.909 --> 36:09.724
You're just refusing to talk to her.

36:09.724 --> 36:11.862
And it's gonna be so fucking painful now.

36:14.257 --> 36:16.447
I simplified the menu in order to get it

36:16.447 --> 36:18.490
so much easier for you, you know that?

36:18.490 --> 36:20.117
- Yes, chef.
- And the menu was designed

36:20.117 --> 36:22.119
for you to open up and talk, okay?

36:22.119 --> 36:23.016
- Yes, chef.

36:23.016 --> 36:24.017
- Look at me.
- Yes chef.

36:24.017 --> 36:25.777
- Broaden your mind out.

36:25.777 --> 36:28.240
And all you do is one plate. Focus.

36:28.240 --> 36:29.108
Next plate, focus.

36:29.108 --> 36:31.264
I just want you to open up a little bit.

36:31.264 --> 36:33.874
She's there to help. Thank you.

36:36.064 --> 36:38.222
- You know what? Let me do this.

36:39.762 --> 36:41.409
Just help with the skillet,
help with the skillet.

36:41.409 --> 36:42.894
- Fucking hell.

36:42.894 --> 36:43.763
Giulian!

36:43.763 --> 36:45.460
- Yes?
- Come here.

36:45.460 --> 36:47.478
Fucking hell. What's the matter with you?

36:47.478 --> 36:49.334
You just shut down on me.

36:49.334 --> 36:51.492
Now do you wanna give me your
jacket and i'll do it for you?

36:51.492 --> 36:53.098
- No, chef.
- It's not difficult.

36:53.098 --> 36:55.350
- I know, chef.
- Can you do this?

36:55.350 --> 36:56.703
Open up. Come on.

36:56.703 --> 37:00.383
You just shut down.
(dramatic music)

37:00.383 --> 37:02.904
(clattering)

37:13.692 --> 37:15.566
With Robert working well with the team,

37:15.566 --> 37:16.549
(bright music)
- Okay, thank you so much.

37:16.549 --> 37:20.324
- [Gordon] And Ari staying out
the way, the bar is bustling.

37:20.324 --> 37:21.700
(people chattering)
- How are you?

37:21.700 --> 37:23.566
Welcome. What can I get you to drink?

37:23.566 --> 37:25.578
- But Chef Giulian needs to raise his game

37:25.578 --> 37:27.268
and start communicating
(tense music)

37:27.268 --> 37:28.967
if we're gonna make the day a success.

37:28.967 --> 37:30.802
You've just shut down on me.

37:30.802 --> 37:32.147
Open up, please.

37:32.147 --> 37:33.600
Get it together. Let's go.

37:37.622 --> 37:39.627
You've about four minutes for that table.

37:40.520 --> 37:43.466
So you do one plate, I do
one plate, is that good?

37:43.466 --> 37:44.335
- What's on this?

37:44.335 --> 37:45.369
- So then you get with the lamb shank,

37:45.369 --> 37:47.736
then you get some lamb
glaze, which is right here.

37:47.736 --> 37:49.164
- Giulian, nice, much better.

37:49.164 --> 37:50.280
Look at me. Much better.

37:50.280 --> 37:51.365
- Yes chef.
- Good.

37:51.365 --> 37:53.033
How is everybody out there?

37:53.033 --> 37:53.902
- Chicken?
- Chicken.

37:53.902 --> 37:55.191
- Chicken.
- Wow.

37:55.191 --> 37:56.922
- [Gordon] The locals are
definitely noticing a change here.

37:56.922 --> 37:58.518
- That was wonderful.

37:58.518 --> 38:00.865
- It's very good. I was very surprised.

38:00.865 --> 38:01.733
- Perfect, I was just saying,

38:01.733 --> 38:03.116
that was perfect for me.
- Great.

38:03.116 --> 38:05.108
- Time to see if the
hotel inspector has too.

38:05.108 --> 38:06.765
Can I sit down?
(bright music)

38:06.765 --> 38:08.236
- Good to see you again.
- Good to see you too.

38:08.236 --> 38:10.029
Recognise a few changes?

38:10.029 --> 38:12.563
- In some ways I didn't recognise
it at all. It was so good.

38:12.563 --> 38:14.544
- What, the entrance hall, in terms of...?

38:14.544 --> 38:19.361
- The total openness, welcoming.
And the signs everywhere.

38:19.361 --> 38:20.230
- When you walked in, was there warmth?

38:20.230 --> 38:21.582
Was there a-
- Ah, there was great warmth.

38:21.582 --> 38:24.419
Now I feel it has that
Diamond Collection feel.

38:24.419 --> 38:27.338
- That's good news. Enjoy lunch.

38:27.338 --> 38:28.475
- Appreciate it.
- Pork's amazing.

38:28.475 --> 38:30.643
- Okay, I'll try. Thank you.

38:30.643 --> 38:32.645
- There's a great buzz at the Inn.

38:32.645 --> 38:34.741
- Sara? Could I have a second?

38:34.741 --> 38:36.090
- Yes.
(tense music)

38:36.090 --> 38:37.796
- [Gordon] I hope that's
not all about the change.

38:37.796 --> 38:39.089
- I'm really busy.

38:39.089 --> 38:42.117
- I just want you to hear I'm
sorry about what happened.

38:42.117 --> 38:43.269
Okay? I'm sorry about that.

38:43.269 --> 38:44.137
- Okay.
(bright music)

38:44.137 --> 38:45.006
I mean, I'm trying to help, Ari,

38:45.006 --> 38:47.312
and you snarl at me a lot.
- I know, yeah.

38:47.312 --> 38:48.702
Yeah. I'm sorry.

38:50.518 --> 38:53.632
- This food is affordably priced,
it's really, really tasty.

38:53.632 --> 38:55.645
- And it's nice to know a
nice place to send people

38:55.645 --> 38:57.903
to get a drink and relax and everything,

38:57.903 --> 38:58.772
- Thank you.
- And that's hard

38:58.772 --> 38:59.985
in the area, so that's great.

38:59.985 --> 39:01.560
- [Gordon] Robert and Ari's communication

39:01.560 --> 39:04.396
has improved by leaps and bounds
since I've been at the inn.

39:04.396 --> 39:05.970
- Let's go back here just for a second.

39:05.970 --> 39:07.701
- [Gordon] But actions
speak louder than words

39:07.701 --> 39:10.082
and I think Robert is
starting to understand that.

39:10.082 --> 39:11.142
(gentle music)
- I just wanted to tell you

39:11.142 --> 39:15.282
that I really appreciate all
the extra effort you've given,

39:15.282 --> 39:20.443
not just this week but the
entire time you've been here,

39:20.443 --> 39:23.311
and this is your pay check,

39:23.311 --> 39:25.772
a bit early because we know you need it,

39:25.772 --> 39:28.848
we wish we had more, but we put
$100 extra in there for you,

39:28.848 --> 39:31.590
just so you have a little bit extra

39:31.590 --> 39:33.654
because we really do appreciate you, Ryan.

39:33.654 --> 39:36.900
So, thanks.
- Thank you very much.

39:39.799 --> 39:41.350
- You and I are gonna bring this back

39:41.350 --> 39:42.476
and Ari's gonna join us.
(gentle music)

39:42.476 --> 39:44.603
- Yeah.
(laughs)

39:44.603 --> 39:48.482
- I haven't been that
emotionally moved in a long time.

39:48.482 --> 39:51.161
I feel like it's all been worth it now.

39:51.161 --> 39:53.865
I just, I feel like it's appreciated.

39:57.611 --> 39:58.825
(bright music)
- What a week.

39:58.825 --> 40:00.462
I think this business is
on the road to recovery

40:00.462 --> 40:05.155
and Robert and his team,
with Ari in the background,

40:05.155 --> 40:06.270
can really make this place work,

40:06.270 --> 40:08.648
because once the locals
invest in this place

40:08.648 --> 40:11.484
word is gonna spread big time.

40:11.484 --> 40:13.708
Wow. Beautiful.

40:14.753 --> 40:15.655
(door clunks)

40:15.655 --> 40:17.646
It's time for me to say my goodbyes,

40:17.646 --> 40:19.648
but, with the crowd enjoying
themselves in the bar

40:19.648 --> 40:21.911
and loving the great
value in the dining room,

40:21.911 --> 40:23.663
it's a hard place to leave.

40:23.663 --> 40:24.539
- Really good.

40:24.539 --> 40:25.407
- This is nice, comfy.

40:25.407 --> 40:26.276
- Definitely is.
- Yeah.

40:26.276 --> 40:27.823
- We're sharing the lamb shanks too.

40:27.823 --> 40:29.036
- Okay, fine.

40:29.036 --> 40:30.068
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

40:30.068 --> 40:31.139
- Excellent.

40:31.139 --> 40:32.008
- Right.

40:32.008 --> 40:34.152
Finally, you seem to have
got this under control, yes?

40:34.152 --> 40:35.021
- Yes, chef.

40:35.021 --> 40:35.890
- And you're opening up?

40:35.890 --> 40:36.967
- Yes, chef.
- Don't stop talking.

40:36.967 --> 40:38.209
- Yes, chef.

40:38.209 --> 40:39.470
- Communicate. Good job.

40:39.470 --> 40:40.339
- Thank you, chef.

40:40.339 --> 40:41.660
- He might have beat a few people down

40:41.660 --> 40:43.464
but then he brought a
few people right back up

40:43.464 --> 40:44.705
and that was necessary.

40:44.705 --> 40:48.030
I was glad he didn't
smack me with his spatula.

40:48.030 --> 40:49.897
(bright music)
(taps on window)

40:49.897 --> 40:51.722
- Ari?
- Sophie!

40:51.722 --> 40:53.005
- I've come to say goodbye.

40:53.005 --> 40:55.528
- I was doing my pay checks.
- Look after yourself.

40:55.528 --> 40:57.019
You were writing pay checks?
- Yes.

40:57.019 --> 40:58.979
- Good luck with the
place. It's the business.

40:58.979 --> 41:00.451
- Absolutely.
- Look after yourself.

41:00.451 --> 41:01.319
- Uh huh.

41:01.319 --> 41:02.191
- Look after Robert.
- Uh huh.

41:02.191 --> 41:04.016
- And support him in all the right places.

41:04.016 --> 41:05.799
- Thank you.
- Best wishes.

41:05.799 --> 41:09.087
- We are very grateful for him
that he has patience for us.

41:09.087 --> 41:11.273
(chuckles)

41:11.273 --> 41:16.486
Because it's not easy to
restructure moulded minds.

41:16.945 --> 41:18.728
- Look after yourself. Yes?

41:18.728 --> 41:19.604
Look after yourself.
(bright music)

41:19.604 --> 41:21.126
- Well, how are you feeling?
- I'm feeling great.

41:21.126 --> 41:25.130
- And it seems like you've
got this under control.

41:25.130 --> 41:26.111
- I'm gonna keep it under control.

41:26.111 --> 41:27.685
- Well, the staff are doing their job,

41:27.685 --> 41:30.021
the bar's functioning, the
dining room is functioning,

41:30.021 --> 41:31.314
the kitchen's functioning.

41:31.314 --> 41:32.534
- That's good. That's beautiful.

41:32.534 --> 41:34.452
- Ari's in the RV.
- And there are people.

41:34.452 --> 41:36.350
- And they seem to be having a good time.

41:36.350 --> 41:37.685
You're on the track now.

41:37.685 --> 41:38.790
- We're on track.

41:38.790 --> 41:40.333
- I have a little present
for you. Stay there.

41:40.333 --> 41:44.348
- Having Gordon come to Juniper
Hill has meant a lot to us.

41:44.348 --> 41:47.225
It was harder than hell, but ultimately,

41:47.225 --> 41:50.124
I know it's gonna do
great things for our staff

41:50.124 --> 41:51.959
and for our town.

41:51.959 --> 41:53.941
- This is something that money cannot buy

41:53.941 --> 41:55.265
but this week you've earned it.

41:55.265 --> 41:57.945
Now the most important
thing, please keep it up.

41:57.945 --> 42:01.761
This is your sign to be
part of the amazing set up,

42:01.761 --> 42:03.606
the Diamond Collection.

42:03.606 --> 42:04.753
- Thank you.
- You deserve this.

42:04.753 --> 42:06.568
- Thank you, thank you.
- Well done.

42:06.568 --> 42:07.475
- Safe journey, home.
(gentle music)

42:07.475 --> 42:10.634
He really did awaken me, put a fire in me,

42:10.634 --> 42:14.993
and I want him to come back
and say, "You really did it."

42:14.993 --> 42:16.067
That's our goal.
(bright music)

42:16.067 --> 42:17.527
- You take care.
- Bye bye.

42:18.653 --> 42:20.929
- [Gordon] Phew. What a beautiful day.

42:24.075 --> 42:26.643
I can't believe those storage
units are still there.

42:27.758 --> 42:30.686
If I was Robert I would
lock Ari in one of them.

42:30.686 --> 42:33.032
(chuckles)

43:06.641 --> 43:07.886
- [Child] One potato, two potato.

43:07.886 --> 43:10.407
(lion roars)
