00:03.037 --> 00:04.805
(chiming)
WOMAN:
Are you pushing it?

00:04.838 --> 00:07.908
Push it!
I have fingers!
It just goes, "Bing."

00:07.941 --> 00:10.678
(chiming)
Is it "bing"
or "bing?"

00:10.711 --> 00:12.513
Bing. Bing.
It's a bad bing.

00:12.546 --> 00:14.082
Makes the sound of
terminal cancer,

00:14.115 --> 00:16.384
or my mother pressing me
for an intimate lunch.

00:16.417 --> 00:18.819
Got it.
Is this video thingy gonna work
now? 'Cause it's important.

00:18.852 --> 00:20.554
You like these shoes?
You bought 'em

00:20.588 --> 00:22.423
for my birthday last week.

00:22.456 --> 00:24.225
Now you can eat the leaves
at the top of the tree.

00:24.258 --> 00:27.895
Half giraffe,
half drag queen, honey.

00:27.928 --> 00:31.365
Hi. It's me, Bryan Collins.

00:31.399 --> 00:33.867
But you won't know me as that.

00:33.901 --> 00:36.737
You will know me as... Dad.

00:37.905 --> 00:39.773
Maybe even Daddy.

00:42.576 --> 00:46.214
Oh, God, I think I would just
die if you called me Daddy.

00:46.247 --> 00:48.382
Um...

00:48.416 --> 00:52.853
this video is to show you...

00:52.886 --> 00:55.789
how desperately
you were wanted.

00:57.591 --> 01:00.060
And how much we love you.

01:01.895 --> 01:04.298
You're our baby.

01:05.566 --> 01:09.203
We are just so excited
to meet you.

01:09.237 --> 01:12.740
But I'm getting ahead
of myself here.

01:12.773 --> 01:14.542
I should go back
to the beginning.

01:14.575 --> 01:16.877
See, this fairytale began
in a faraway land called Ohio,

01:16.910 --> 01:18.646
where four
very different people,

01:18.679 --> 01:21.115
against all odds,
ended up becoming a family.

01:21.149 --> 01:23.884
Would you look at that?

01:23.917 --> 01:25.419
Just strutting
down the middle

01:25.453 --> 01:27.321
of Buck Eye Road
in broad daylight,

01:27.355 --> 01:29.123
proud as gay peacocks.

01:29.157 --> 01:31.492
Why shouldn't they be, Nana?
Don't call me that.

01:31.525 --> 01:34.162
I don't look old enough
to be a grandmother.
Great-grandmother.

01:34.195 --> 01:36.930
I happen to love the gays.
I could never get my hair

01:36.964 --> 01:39.433
to look this good
without 'em.
Seems like they
love each other, so...

01:39.467 --> 01:41.302
Oh, and now with the PDA?

01:41.335 --> 01:43.437
Those ass campers
have some nerve.

01:43.471 --> 01:45.773
(laughs)
Nana, those are lesbians.

01:45.806 --> 01:47.508
Those are ugly men.

01:47.541 --> 01:49.143
Oh.

01:49.177 --> 01:51.279
What did you
forget this time?
My name tag.

01:51.312 --> 01:53.481
I need it for work.
I don't understand.

01:53.514 --> 01:55.283
You were always so pretty.

01:55.316 --> 01:57.651
You got knocked up.
You pissed it all away.

01:57.685 --> 01:59.253
You wasted your
entire life.

01:59.287 --> 02:00.821
Thanks for the pep talk, Nana.

02:00.854 --> 02:03.624
You were a year older than me
when you had my mom.

02:03.657 --> 02:05.326
I was married.
I thought

02:05.359 --> 02:06.760
your mother was
a fibroid tumor.

02:06.794 --> 02:08.095
By the time I figured it out,

02:08.128 --> 02:10.798
she had a face,
and I was screwed.

02:10.831 --> 02:13.501
I should have
become a nun.

02:19.907 --> 02:21.609
MAN:
Say it.

02:21.642 --> 02:24.845
The United States is the most
powerful country on Earth.

02:24.878 --> 02:27.481
Yeah. Oh!

02:27.515 --> 02:29.049
Oh! Goldie!

02:29.082 --> 02:30.984
I was gone six minutes.

02:31.018 --> 02:32.320
Six.

02:32.353 --> 02:33.854
How is this even possible?

02:33.887 --> 02:35.956
Was she hiding in the bushes
when I left?

02:35.989 --> 02:37.425
Tool shed.

02:40.528 --> 02:42.162
Oh.
Oh.

02:42.196 --> 02:43.597
(sighs)

02:45.366 --> 02:47.335
I buy it in bulk.

02:47.368 --> 02:49.303
You'll need it for
his tighty whiteys.

02:49.337 --> 02:50.571
Let's just say, the man's not

02:50.604 --> 02:52.206
real detail-oriented
back there, so...

02:53.841 --> 02:56.277
Oh, and, um... one last thing?

02:57.845 --> 02:59.913
I've kind of given up
on my life.

02:59.947 --> 03:01.682
I forgot I want it all.

03:01.715 --> 03:04.718
This was the last push I needed
to remember that, so thank you.

03:05.753 --> 03:07.655
Congratulations.

03:07.688 --> 03:10.458
He's all yours.

03:12.293 --> 03:14.428
So, are you thinking
about joining

03:14.462 --> 03:16.664
the Brownies this year?
Did I ever tell you

03:16.697 --> 03:19.900
that I set my troop's record
for cookie sales?

03:19.933 --> 03:22.770
In spite of that Mindy Goldfarb
trying to Jew down my customers.

03:22.803 --> 03:24.204
Nana, you're a bigot.

03:24.238 --> 03:25.739
I'm unfriending you right now.

03:25.773 --> 03:28.709
I am extremely tolerant
to all peoples.

03:28.742 --> 03:30.010
When they opened
that Chipotle here,

03:30.043 --> 03:32.045
I was the first
of my friends to go.

03:32.079 --> 03:33.414
And that is Spanish food.

03:33.447 --> 03:35.716
Still unfriended.

03:35.749 --> 03:37.885
(sighs)

03:37.918 --> 03:39.186
Now why are you crying?

03:39.219 --> 03:40.688
My whole life,
I've wanted to leave Clay,

03:40.721 --> 03:42.890
and now I have the greatest
excuse in the world.

03:42.923 --> 03:44.725
Oh, please. You caught him
singing Springsteen

03:44.758 --> 03:46.026
on the toilet before.

03:46.059 --> 03:48.362
Mmm, the man was on a date.

03:48.396 --> 03:50.130
In my own bed.

03:54.067 --> 03:55.569
WOMAN:
What kind of closet space

03:55.603 --> 03:57.070
are we talking about here?

03:57.104 --> 03:58.472
I'm gonna need lots of room
for my wigs.

03:58.506 --> 03:59.873
You're not moving in

03:59.907 --> 04:00.974
unless you're real good
at making food.

04:01.008 --> 04:02.976
You, Hello Kitty, out.

04:03.010 --> 04:04.945
Whoa. Hey.

04:04.978 --> 04:08.048
That is a toy, right?
You know something, Clay?

04:08.081 --> 04:11.619
I have put up with you
for the past nine years.

04:11.652 --> 04:12.920
I've put up with your

04:12.953 --> 04:15.289
ridiculous Fozzie Bear
impersonations,

04:15.323 --> 04:17.791
with your self-diagnosed
narcolepsy.

04:17.825 --> 04:20.127
No. That's real.
It's not just naps.

04:20.160 --> 04:22.963
I can't think of anything else
to do except to kill you.

04:22.996 --> 04:25.399
Now, unfortunately,
I couldn't live in prison

04:25.433 --> 04:27.935
without my Lean Cuisine.

04:29.303 --> 04:32.473
So I am open to other options.

04:39.012 --> 04:41.048
Hey, baby?

04:42.516 --> 04:44.785
You ever think
about going someplace amazing?

04:44.818 --> 04:46.620
Somewhere you've never,
ever been before?

04:46.654 --> 04:48.589
Every single day.
Like where?

04:48.622 --> 04:50.123
I want to drive to Hawaii.

04:52.626 --> 04:55.963
I think we can make it
to Honolulu on half a tank.

04:55.996 --> 04:57.631
(sighs)

04:57.665 --> 04:59.967
(car engine starts)

05:09.410 --> 05:11.111
MAN (on TV):
Pretty good for Tex,
and now he'll run with it...

05:11.144 --> 05:12.513
Hey, babe.

05:12.546 --> 05:13.781
I have to tell you something.

05:13.814 --> 05:14.948
Got to wait
till halftime, sweetie.

05:14.982 --> 05:16.984
Is that when
Madonna sings?
(scoffs)

05:17.017 --> 05:19.520
Okay, so, I was shopping...

05:19.553 --> 05:22.490
A question for you.

05:22.523 --> 05:24.992
Are you sure I don't look
like Mary Tyler Moore in these?

05:25.025 --> 05:27.127
Do you want to look
like Mary Tyler Moore?

05:27.160 --> 05:28.496
Well, not the
hair, obviously,

05:28.529 --> 05:30.330
but yes, yes, I do.

05:30.364 --> 05:32.866
Mmm. Here we go.
Five-yard line. Here we go.

05:32.900 --> 05:34.502
Money! Here we go!
Okay, fine, fine,
fine, fine.

05:34.535 --> 05:36.504
Fine, fine, I will hurry it up,
but I was just trying

05:36.537 --> 05:38.872
to paint you
a picture.
Okay, what? Yes.

05:41.542 --> 05:44.645
Oh, my God, that is the cutest
thing I have ever seen.

05:44.678 --> 05:47.214
I must have it.

05:49.783 --> 05:51.018
(coos)

05:51.051 --> 05:52.986
(baby giggles)

05:53.020 --> 05:54.354
(laughs)

05:54.388 --> 05:56.890
(laughing)

06:02.396 --> 06:05.198
MAN (on TV):
He is going to be a star...

06:05.232 --> 06:06.767
Bry, we have to talk
about your dieting.

06:06.800 --> 06:09.703
Honey, when I saw
that miniature person,

06:09.737 --> 06:11.338
whose skin was
flawless, by the way,

06:11.371 --> 06:12.740
I really got it.

06:12.773 --> 06:14.542
I want us

06:14.575 --> 06:16.544
to have baby clothes...

06:16.577 --> 06:18.345
and a baby to wear them.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.180
MAN (on TV):
He's got the first down
and more!

06:20.213 --> 06:23.050
Past the 45,
out of bounds at the 47...

06:23.083 --> 06:26.554
Sweetie, you know you can't
return a baby to Barneys.

06:26.587 --> 06:30.524
David... look,

06:30.558 --> 06:32.059
you are the kindest man

06:32.092 --> 06:34.194
I have ever had the pleasure
to love.

06:34.227 --> 06:35.563
(dog panting)

06:35.596 --> 06:37.397
You would be an amazing father.

06:37.431 --> 06:39.232
You would feed the child,

06:39.266 --> 06:42.202
and bathe him and care for him
in the middle of the night

06:42.235 --> 06:44.137
when he has rubella,
or anything else contagious.

06:44.171 --> 06:45.539
What would you do?

06:45.573 --> 06:47.207
I'm the fun dad.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.977
Oh.

06:50.010 --> 06:52.646
DAVID: I don't know. My dad
screwed me up pretty good.

06:52.680 --> 06:55.382
What do you think two dads
would do to a kid?

06:55.415 --> 06:57.718
You really think it's such
a good idea to bring a kid

06:57.751 --> 06:59.386
into the world with such
a nontraditional family?

06:59.419 --> 07:01.121
I know somebody else
from a nontraditional family.

07:01.154 --> 07:03.557
A Halfrican-American
who was raised by a grandma.

07:03.591 --> 07:05.993
And that person seems
to be doing just fine.

07:06.026 --> 07:07.761
Oh, yeah. Barack Obama.

07:07.795 --> 07:10.631
No. Mariah Carey,
but your example works, too.

07:10.664 --> 07:12.766
Look around.
Your definition

07:12.800 --> 07:14.401
of traditional
might need a refresh.

07:14.434 --> 07:15.836
Check her out.
She's old enough

07:15.869 --> 07:17.304
to be their grandmother,
but she wanted them

07:17.337 --> 07:19.106
so badly, she dusted off
her dinosaur eggs.

07:19.139 --> 07:20.508
(laughs)

07:20.541 --> 07:22.275
I was a whore for a long time.

07:22.309 --> 07:24.077
I mean, I slept with everyone.

07:24.111 --> 07:25.913
I acted like a kid
for too long.

07:25.946 --> 07:27.648
Just wasn't ready to have one.

07:27.681 --> 07:30.784
By the time I was ready,
I couldn't find the right man.

07:30.818 --> 07:33.320
When I gave up looking for him,
I found me.

07:33.353 --> 07:36.490
And then, with the help
of a lot of drugs, them.

07:36.524 --> 07:37.825
Hey.

07:37.858 --> 07:39.359
My husband's
regular-sized,

07:39.392 --> 07:41.094
so there was a 50% chance

07:41.128 --> 07:43.296
that my daughter would be a
part-time Christmas elf like me.

07:43.330 --> 07:45.666
I told my husband,
we didn't have to have kids.

07:45.699 --> 07:47.635
We didn't have to risk it.

07:47.668 --> 07:49.503
My husband said
that he loves me,

07:49.537 --> 07:52.606
so why wouldn't she be loved
in this world?

07:52.640 --> 07:55.042
She's gonna be taller
than me this year.

07:57.878 --> 07:59.279
Face it, honey.

07:59.312 --> 08:02.616
Abnormal is the new normal.

08:02.650 --> 08:05.118
So, thank you so much
for coming over to the house.

08:05.152 --> 08:06.887
That's just one
of the many benefits

08:06.920 --> 08:09.022
of being a Platinum Member
of Expanding Families.

08:09.056 --> 08:10.524
Oh.
That,

08:10.558 --> 08:12.960
and the stunning models
I put in your VIP egg file.

08:12.993 --> 08:14.394
Models.
Real...?

08:14.427 --> 08:16.129
One of our recent clients--
a very famous

08:16.163 --> 08:17.531
designer who I'm wearing,

08:17.565 --> 08:18.666
but I can't reveal--

08:18.699 --> 08:20.467
Oh.
he wanted
to make sure

08:20.500 --> 08:22.002
that his egg donor
was not a fatty.

08:22.035 --> 08:24.137
Sure.
We did a worldwide search,
and I threw

08:24.171 --> 08:25.539
some of the sloppy seconds
your way.

08:25.573 --> 08:26.907
All right, what-what...

08:26.940 --> 08:28.508
what about the things
that matter,

08:28.542 --> 08:31.745
like intelligence, or the
ability for cognitive thought?

08:31.779 --> 08:33.814
Uh, something that would
give the kid a shot at being

08:33.847 --> 08:35.348
head of the Mathletes,
like I was.

08:35.382 --> 08:36.584
BRYAN:
I would like

08:36.617 --> 08:38.085
a skinny, blond child

08:38.118 --> 08:39.519
who doesn't cry.

08:39.553 --> 08:41.689
Is this extra?
It's impossible.

08:41.722 --> 08:42.990
Not for our Platinum Members.

08:43.023 --> 08:43.924
I knew it.
You can't be serious.

08:43.957 --> 08:45.325
Here's how it works.

08:45.358 --> 08:46.860
You click through
our egg donor files,

08:46.894 --> 08:49.496
find your match,
create a perfect embryo,

08:49.529 --> 08:51.031
and then implant it
in a surrogate.

08:51.064 --> 08:53.100
(squeals)
She's just like
an Easy-Bake Oven,

08:53.133 --> 08:55.603
except with no legal rights
to the cupcake.
(laughter)

08:55.636 --> 08:56.937
Now, who's gonna be the bio dad?

08:56.970 --> 08:59.272
I am.
I am.

08:59.306 --> 09:00.473
Uh-oh.

09:03.410 --> 09:05.078
I'm kind of nervous, babe.
This is a big deal.

09:05.112 --> 09:06.446
We're picking the biological
mother of our child.

09:06.479 --> 09:07.681
Oh, my God, we have 80 choices.

09:07.715 --> 09:09.583
First up is...

09:09.617 --> 09:13.086
100 pounds gone.
Just 100 pounds to go.

09:13.120 --> 09:14.054
Bless.

09:14.087 --> 09:15.222
I'm really into sci-fi,

09:15.255 --> 09:16.356
but not the Green Goblin.

09:16.389 --> 09:17.758
(snorts)
Obviously.

09:17.791 --> 09:19.526
Trust me,
I recognize the irony.

09:19.559 --> 09:21.862
Nine abortions,
and here I am.

09:21.895 --> 09:23.530
I like her.

09:23.563 --> 09:25.532
Hi. My name is Abby.

09:25.565 --> 09:29.402
People say I look a lot
like Gwyneth Paltrow...

09:29.436 --> 09:32.439
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!
I got it!
I got it! I got it!

09:33.641 --> 09:36.043
(laughing)

09:36.076 --> 09:39.212
Well, this is as far west
as we could go without driving

09:39.246 --> 09:41.081
into the water. Oh.

09:41.114 --> 09:43.216
Mom?
What?

09:43.250 --> 09:44.618
What were your dreams

09:44.652 --> 09:46.319
before you and Daddy
accidentally had me?

09:46.353 --> 09:48.722
Uh... well...

09:48.756 --> 09:50.758
(clears throat)

09:50.791 --> 09:53.260
I wanted to be a lawyer.

09:53.293 --> 09:56.063
An independent woman
who didn't need a man,

09:56.096 --> 09:57.497
and wear these expensive suits,

09:57.530 --> 09:58.799
like Julianna Margulies
in The Good Wife,

09:58.832 --> 10:00.300
but without the
disgraced husband.

10:00.333 --> 10:02.135
Based on the facts
of my compelling argument,

10:02.169 --> 10:04.237
and use of big words, like ipso
facto, I respectfully request

10:04.271 --> 10:05.839
you return a verdict
of not guilty as charged.

10:05.873 --> 10:07.074
MAN:
Yes!

10:07.107 --> 10:08.608
Not guilty.
Whatever she says.

10:08.642 --> 10:11.411
I agree. She's too good.
Case dismissed.

10:11.444 --> 10:13.681
So, why can't
that still be your dream?

10:14.815 --> 10:16.684
'Cause today my dream is...

10:18.185 --> 10:20.120
...is wishing
I didn't have to tell you

10:20.153 --> 10:22.389
that the last three days
are all I can afford.

10:23.724 --> 10:25.158
I'm sorry.

10:25.192 --> 10:27.627
You don't ever have
to say that to me.

10:27.661 --> 10:29.096
Say it to yourself.

10:29.129 --> 10:31.564
(cell phone ringtone playing)

10:36.670 --> 10:38.471
Hi.

10:38.505 --> 10:41.008
Oh, so you finally decided
to take my call.

10:41.041 --> 10:42.442
What happened?
Did the police pick you up?

10:42.475 --> 10:43.844
You called the police?

10:43.877 --> 10:46.279
You stole my car.
I'm sorry, but does

10:46.313 --> 10:48.148
the washer-dryer unit
come with the house?
If it's not

10:48.181 --> 10:50.117
on the flyer, no one knows.
Just make an offer.

10:50.150 --> 10:52.019
You are a selfish,
spoiled child.

10:52.052 --> 10:54.321
You're right.
I'm sorry. Thank you.

10:54.354 --> 10:56.123
I had to ride the bus today--
the bus.

10:56.156 --> 10:57.991
I was sitting
next to a man with no arms.

10:58.025 --> 11:01.328
He was drinking a thermos
full of mushroom soup

11:01.361 --> 11:03.330
with these little stublets
coming out of his shoulder.

11:03.363 --> 11:05.966
It was like watching Flipper try
to drink a beer.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.167
Why do I have to spend

11:07.200 --> 11:08.969
my entire life making up

11:09.002 --> 11:10.237
for everyone else's mistakes?

11:10.270 --> 11:11.538
You don't.

11:12.706 --> 11:13.673
Not anymore.

11:13.707 --> 11:15.475
I keep staying with you,

11:15.508 --> 11:18.846
thinking things will change
for me and Shania, but...

11:18.879 --> 11:23.050
but the thing is, if-if I don't
change, nothing ever will.

11:24.351 --> 11:26.186
We're not coming home, Nana.

11:26.219 --> 11:28.221
Wait, what?

11:35.729 --> 11:37.530
Isn't technology amazing?

11:37.564 --> 11:39.366
We created fully formed embryos
with Gwyneth Paltrow's twin

11:39.399 --> 11:40.934
and just popped 'em
into you to grow.

11:40.968 --> 11:43.771
To you, Melissa,
our caring, nurturing surrogate.

11:43.804 --> 11:45.238
Our little swimmers
are duking it out already.

11:45.272 --> 11:47.741
May the best sperm win.

11:47.775 --> 11:49.442
I just want to assure you guys

11:49.476 --> 11:51.845
that I will do everything
in my power to take care

11:51.879 --> 11:53.713
of myself and
in turn be

11:53.747 --> 11:56.516
a loving host
to your precious child.

11:56.549 --> 11:57.684
Melissa, I just want
to let you know

11:57.717 --> 11:58.886
that we will be
here for you

11:58.919 --> 12:00.287
during every step
of the pregnancy.

12:00.320 --> 12:01.855
If there is anything
that you need,

12:01.889 --> 12:03.857
please do not hesitate to ask.

12:03.891 --> 12:05.058
Yeah, I can Skype at work.

12:05.092 --> 12:06.359
I need a BMW.

12:06.393 --> 12:07.360
I'm sorry?
I don't understand.

12:07.394 --> 12:08.595
Let me help you.
Excuse me.

12:08.628 --> 12:10.263
I'd like a gin and tonic.

12:10.297 --> 12:11.932
Uh-oh, that's alcohol.

12:11.965 --> 12:13.433
You can't drink
when you're pregnant.

12:13.466 --> 12:15.936
Anything else?
Just an ashtray. Thank you.

12:15.969 --> 12:18.605
You guys should think
of the good of your baby.

12:18.638 --> 12:20.073
Just give me
the cigarettes.
You're blackmailing us?

12:20.107 --> 12:21.942
You guys are gross.

12:23.076 --> 12:26.713
* Baby love, my baby love.

12:26.746 --> 12:27.714
(children shouting)

12:27.747 --> 12:30.317
Oh, babe,
he has your nose.

12:30.350 --> 12:32.953
We can have that fixed.

12:32.986 --> 12:34.988
He's making that face
like he needs to go potty.

12:35.022 --> 12:36.056
David, that's you.

12:36.089 --> 12:37.825
He just went.
Well...

12:39.159 --> 12:42.162
Come here. Oh.
Oh, yeah.

12:42.195 --> 12:44.431
He looks like me
when I was a puppy.

12:44.464 --> 12:46.733
(ringtone playing)

12:46.766 --> 12:47.801
It's Gary.

12:47.835 --> 12:49.502
Yes.

12:49.536 --> 12:51.438
Hi, Bryan, it's Gary Snyder,
Expanding Families.

12:51.471 --> 12:53.273
How are you?

12:53.306 --> 12:56.844
I just want to apologize again
for the incident that occurred

12:56.877 --> 12:57.978
with your previous
surrogate choice.

12:58.011 --> 12:59.312
We had no idea.

12:59.346 --> 13:01.681
Celine Dion gave her
a great reference.

13:01.714 --> 13:03.316
Well, we dropped
the litigation

13:03.350 --> 13:04.784
when we found out the womb
terrorist wasn't pregnant.

13:04.818 --> 13:05.919
Well, we have a new surrogate,

13:05.953 --> 13:07.520
and I am absolutely confident

13:07.554 --> 13:09.456
she'd be perfect for your needs.

13:09.489 --> 13:11.658
Why don't you just come in
and meet her?
Please?

13:11.691 --> 13:12.960
I'm great at
being pregnant.

13:12.993 --> 13:14.928
I had tons of energy
and no morning sickness.

13:14.962 --> 13:16.263
Having Shania is the
most successful thing

13:16.296 --> 13:17.597
I've done in my life so far.

13:17.630 --> 13:19.632
Any family history of cancer?
No.

13:19.666 --> 13:22.435
He's a doctor
for lady bits.

13:22.469 --> 13:24.704
A gay-necologist.
Good for you.

13:24.737 --> 13:29.709
So why, then, does a beautiful,
smart, seemingly sane person

13:29.742 --> 13:32.279
want to gestate
someone else's child?

13:32.312 --> 13:35.648
Well, $35,000 is a
huge chunk of money.

13:35.682 --> 13:38.151
I need a way to change
my daughter's life.

13:38.185 --> 13:39.953
I want to go to
law school someday.

13:39.987 --> 13:41.688
And you have no problem
with doing this for two men?

13:41.721 --> 13:43.857
Oh, no, I requested
a gay couple.

13:43.891 --> 13:47.627
I was driving, and I overheard
a deranged homeless woman

13:47.660 --> 13:49.296
saying not so nice things

13:49.329 --> 13:52.966
about a lesbian couple,
but all I could think was,

13:53.000 --> 13:54.567
a family is a family.

13:55.869 --> 13:57.370
And love is love.

14:00.207 --> 14:01.875
I love that Goldie.
I don't know.

14:01.909 --> 14:03.310
She reminds me of me

14:03.343 --> 14:04.878
when I first came
to L.A. to make it.

14:04.912 --> 14:06.713
I did like
that daughter of hers.

14:06.746 --> 14:08.048
I'm less sold on her.

14:08.081 --> 14:09.082
(laughs)

14:09.116 --> 14:11.351
I want us to have a baby.

14:11.384 --> 14:13.820
At some point, we just got
to move past the setbacks.

14:13.853 --> 14:16.689
So, what's stopping you?

14:16.723 --> 14:19.026
I don't know.

14:19.059 --> 14:21.694
I don't want our sperm
to be competitive.

14:21.728 --> 14:24.197
I don't want our sperm

14:24.231 --> 14:26.900
to do some crazy
genetic race.

14:26.934 --> 14:28.501
What are you talking about?

14:28.535 --> 14:32.372
When did you make
this decision?

14:32.405 --> 14:36.343
I have four masculine brothers
and one masculine sister.

14:36.376 --> 14:37.377
(laughs)

14:37.410 --> 14:39.446
You're an only child.

14:39.479 --> 14:42.082
It's more important for
you to create something

14:42.115 --> 14:44.851
that's yours biologically
to recognize.

14:44.884 --> 14:46.886
Not being the
baby's bio dad

14:46.920 --> 14:48.922
doesn't make me
any less of a dad.

14:48.956 --> 14:50.723
You'd do that for me?

14:50.757 --> 14:53.693
No, for me.

14:53.726 --> 14:56.329
We need more people like you
walking around in the world.

14:58.098 --> 14:59.599
Plus, then I'll get to
lord it over you forever.

14:59.632 --> 15:00.767
Thank you.

15:01.468 --> 15:02.769
I love you.

15:02.802 --> 15:04.404
I love you.

15:04.437 --> 15:06.073
Now, go make me
macaroni and cheese

15:06.106 --> 15:07.440
so we can get started
on my foot rub.

15:07.474 --> 15:10.043
(groans)
Okay.

15:10.077 --> 15:12.445
Thank you.

15:20.988 --> 15:23.256
Your embryos are ready
for implantation.

15:23.290 --> 15:25.492
Now, as a doctor, David
has indicated he'd like

15:25.525 --> 15:27.727
to witness the procedure if
that's okay with you, Goldie.

15:27.760 --> 15:30.097
Sure. He'll be more
involved than the dad was

15:30.130 --> 15:32.065
last time I got pregnant.

15:32.099 --> 15:33.466
I'd love you to be
there, too, Bryan.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.135
Oh, no, no, I faint
at the sight of vagina.

15:35.168 --> 15:36.636
They're like
tarantula faces.

15:36.669 --> 15:39.072
Oh.
Can my daughter stay with me?

15:39.106 --> 15:40.507
Oh, no, honey, don't you
worry about anything.

15:40.540 --> 15:41.841
I'll watch
your little cutie here.

15:41.874 --> 15:42.976
You just go get yourself
knocked up.

15:43.010 --> 15:45.145
Me and Lady Pants
will chill out.

15:47.347 --> 15:48.648
Do everything I wouldn't do.

15:56.623 --> 15:59.192
These pants were
very expensive.

15:59.226 --> 16:02.495
To me, they don't look
like that.

16:02.529 --> 16:04.531
Any second thoughts?

16:04.564 --> 16:06.033
I'm good.

16:06.066 --> 16:07.300
How about you?

16:07.334 --> 16:09.269
Oh, me?
Yeah.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.138
I mean, having a baby
is a huge step.

16:11.171 --> 16:13.606
Everything in your life
is gonna be covered

16:13.640 --> 16:15.875
in poop, spit-up and drool.

16:15.908 --> 16:18.811
It'll be a bit like living
with my soon-to-be-ex-husband.

16:18.845 --> 16:20.513
(laughs)

16:20.547 --> 16:22.482
Oh, my God,
you're crying.

16:22.515 --> 16:24.651
I'm always the guy that
everyone counts on.

16:24.684 --> 16:26.619
I mean, when do I get
a chance to fall apart?

16:26.653 --> 16:28.488
Well, now is
a real good time.

16:28.521 --> 16:30.790
At work I'm a rock,
and at home I'm a rock.

16:30.823 --> 16:32.025
I'm like what
Simon and Garfunkel

16:32.059 --> 16:33.393
would refer to
as an island.

16:33.426 --> 16:34.694
Are those the doctors
you work with?

16:34.727 --> 16:35.728
Oh, my God.

16:37.497 --> 16:38.865
(sniffs)
You know, I've delivered

16:38.898 --> 16:40.333
a thousand babies
in my life,

16:40.367 --> 16:41.634
and I don't think
I've ever held one

16:41.668 --> 16:43.703
that's over four
minutes old.

16:45.838 --> 16:47.507
What if I'm not
ready to be a dad?

16:47.540 --> 16:50.243
I became a mom
in a Rite Aid bathroom.

16:50.277 --> 16:52.612
I had to borrow 25 cents
to get into the stall.

16:53.946 --> 16:55.182
You're way ahead
of the game.

16:55.215 --> 16:56.816
David,

16:56.849 --> 17:00.553
you are going to be
an amazing dad.

17:01.688 --> 17:03.490
(door opens)

17:03.523 --> 17:05.325
WOMAN: Excuse me.
Someone's here for you.

17:05.358 --> 17:07.694
Claims not to
be your nana.

17:07.727 --> 17:09.862
How... how'd you find me?

17:09.896 --> 17:12.265
I have been hot
on your trail for days.

17:12.299 --> 17:13.866
This one led me
straight to you.

17:13.900 --> 17:16.569
They're in Venice Beach,
California.

17:16.603 --> 17:18.371
Twitter stamped their location.

17:18.405 --> 17:21.508
You people are so darn
good with computers.

17:21.541 --> 17:24.211
And thanks for helping
build the railroads.

17:24.244 --> 17:25.445
Who cares how?

17:25.478 --> 17:26.679
There is a giant

17:26.713 --> 17:28.181
homosexual elephant
in the room.

17:28.215 --> 17:30.283
Listen, ma'am,
I know it's a lot

17:30.317 --> 17:31.718
to digest,
but my partner and I

17:31.751 --> 17:32.752
cannot have a child

17:32.785 --> 17:34.121
the traditional way,

17:34.154 --> 17:36.723
and Goldie here wants
to carry ours for us.

17:36.756 --> 17:38.291
Oh, Bryan, I hauled my ass

17:38.325 --> 17:40.860
all the way across town
to bring you these damn eggs.

17:40.893 --> 17:42.195
Oh, no.

17:42.229 --> 17:45.532
You are not growing
one of her kind of eggs

17:45.565 --> 17:46.866
in my granddaughter.

17:46.899 --> 17:48.301
Oh, no, sweetie,
these are poached.

17:48.335 --> 17:50.603
What the hell you mean,
my kind of eggs?

17:50.637 --> 17:52.972
The last time I checked,
this diamond-speckled watch

17:53.005 --> 17:54.541
my gay boss bought me

17:54.574 --> 17:57.644
without his consent,
it was 2012.

17:57.677 --> 17:59.812
Now, why don't you take your
Callista Gingrich hairdo

17:59.846 --> 18:02.749
and your racist mind
back to the past

18:02.782 --> 18:04.484
or the South
where they belong?

18:04.517 --> 18:06.786
Nana, I want to
help this family.

18:06.819 --> 18:08.421
I feel like I just ate
a black and gay stew

18:08.455 --> 18:09.956
right before
I fell asleep.

18:09.989 --> 18:12.091
This is a nightmare.
No,

18:12.125 --> 18:13.393
this ain't a nightmare,
but I'm gonna

18:13.426 --> 18:15.094
pinch you real
good to make sure.

18:15.128 --> 18:17.497
Goldie, have you lost
your damn mind?

18:17.530 --> 18:19.432
What are you doing, helping
these salami-smokers?

18:19.466 --> 18:21.668
Wow.
That's a good one. That's new.

18:21.701 --> 18:23.903
It is so wrong,
and have you even thought

18:23.936 --> 18:26.773
about what kind of message
you are sending your daughter?

18:26.806 --> 18:28.608
That you can be
whatever you want to be

18:28.641 --> 18:30.477
no matter how many people
tell you that you're nothing.

18:30.510 --> 18:32.179
It is not normal.

18:32.212 --> 18:34.447
The baby I want to carry for
David and Bryan will have

18:34.481 --> 18:36.783
two loving parents who
desperately want a child.

18:36.816 --> 18:38.785
Who are you to say
that's not normal?

18:38.818 --> 18:40.187
Because I lived it.

18:42.655 --> 18:46.426
Okay, here goes.

18:46.459 --> 18:48.495
Your grandfather had a friend
who worked for him

18:48.528 --> 18:50.330
at the pet store for many years.

18:50.363 --> 18:52.131
Uncle Leon, with
all the puffy hair?

18:52.165 --> 18:54.601
One day, my old Chrysler leaked
oil all over my driveway,

18:54.634 --> 18:57.604
so I had to go down
to the pet store and get a bag

18:57.637 --> 18:59.306
of kitty litter
to soak it up.

18:59.339 --> 19:03.042
I walked through the back door,
and I saw them together.

19:03.075 --> 19:05.011
Oh, Nana.

19:05.044 --> 19:07.514
Leon stood there
with his private parts dangling

19:07.547 --> 19:09.949
for all the parakeets
to laugh at.

19:09.982 --> 19:12.319
What the hell
is she talking about?

19:12.352 --> 19:14.821
That man didn't love me.
So, what did you do?

19:14.854 --> 19:16.456
I stayed with him
for ten more years,

19:16.489 --> 19:18.191
and I helped him build
his Beanie Baby collection.

19:18.225 --> 19:22.161
Now, Goldie,
I am begging you, please,

19:22.195 --> 19:23.296
let's just go get Goggles

19:23.330 --> 19:25.498
and get back in the car
and go home.

19:25.532 --> 19:26.966
I'm sorry, Nana.

19:26.999 --> 19:29.035
We're staying.

19:29.068 --> 19:32.071
I need to help these
guys... and myself.

19:41.180 --> 19:43.049
(mouthing)

19:52.124 --> 19:54.494
Goldie's mama ran away
and ditched her with me

19:54.527 --> 19:56.596
when she was just
eight years old.

19:56.629 --> 19:59.532
Three generations
of babies raising babies.

19:59.566 --> 20:00.900
Earlier, when you referred

20:00.933 --> 20:02.402
to the homosexual elephant
in the room,

20:02.435 --> 20:04.571
you were talking
about David, right?

20:06.573 --> 20:09.542
Okay, we are here waiting
to find out if we made you.

20:09.576 --> 20:11.578
I'm so excited,
I haven't eaten in two days.

20:11.611 --> 20:13.946
Thanks to you,
I'm wearing my skinny jeans.

20:13.980 --> 20:15.682
Does it say
anything yet?

20:15.715 --> 20:17.049
Remember,
one line-- not pregnant,

20:17.083 --> 20:18.418
two lines-- pregnant.

20:18.451 --> 20:19.719
GOLDIE:
I just peed. I'm waiting.

20:19.752 --> 20:21.087
Say something
to the baby, Daddy David.

20:21.120 --> 20:22.389
What, what, what...?
Come on.

20:22.422 --> 20:23.723
We don't know
anything yet.

20:23.756 --> 20:25.425
(indistinct chatter)
(Bryan gasps)

20:25.458 --> 20:27.627
BRYAN:
And there's the lady
who made you possible.

20:27.660 --> 20:30.430
Hi. This is the longest
three minutes of my life.

20:30.463 --> 20:32.031
Oh, now's the perfect time
for the thing.

20:32.064 --> 20:32.799
Oh, the thing.
Get the thing.

20:32.832 --> 20:33.900
One second.

20:33.933 --> 20:35.568
What?

20:35.602 --> 20:37.537
Yes, come here.

20:37.570 --> 20:39.272
(grunts)

20:39.306 --> 20:41.474
Guys.

20:41.508 --> 20:43.276
It's your lawyer suit.
I helped pick it.

20:43.310 --> 20:44.444
BRYAN:
And then I re-picked it

20:44.477 --> 20:46.413
with far fewer feathers
and bangles.

20:46.446 --> 20:48.548
We want to help make
your dreams come true.

20:48.581 --> 20:50.983
'Cause you're helping us
with ours.

20:51.017 --> 20:54.587
But what if it
doesn't work?

20:54.621 --> 20:56.289
What if that stick
says I'm not pregnant?

20:56.323 --> 20:58.090
Honey, it doesn't matter
what it says.

20:58.124 --> 21:00.460
This whole thing only started
feeling real after we met you.

21:00.493 --> 21:02.629
You gave us...

21:03.663 --> 21:05.965
You gave me hope.

21:07.166 --> 21:08.801
Now I know how to be a dad.

21:08.835 --> 21:10.069
The only question is: when?

21:10.102 --> 21:13.039
Now, what the hell
does that stick say?

21:15.875 --> 21:18.878
