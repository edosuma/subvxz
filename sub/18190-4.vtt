WEBVTT

00:04.000 --> 00:05.800
I'm here to win the heart of Ariadne.

00:07.040 --> 00:08.240
Am I too ambitious?

00:08.280 --> 00:10.844
I'm not sure a prince can ever
be too ambitious.

00:13.600 --> 00:16.590
You were lucky.
It won't always be that way.

00:16.829 --> 00:18.961
I would be honoured to accept your proposal.

00:59.882 --> 01:01.282
The wedding date is set?

01:02.840 --> 01:04.830
We leave for Aegina in two days.

01:05.528 --> 01:07.590
What news of the emissary
Ariadne dispatched?

01:07.640 --> 01:11.017
It would seem the road to Aegina is
fraught with danger.

01:11.720 --> 01:13.590
As our young Queen is about to find out.

01:13.778 --> 01:15.510
I will persuade them towards Phyria.

01:15.672 --> 01:18.640
That will give us the best chance of success.
- And the Queen suspects nothing?

01:18.711 --> 01:20.950
She knows I was estranged from my father.

01:21.023 --> 01:22.743
Not that we never reconciled.

01:28.640 --> 01:30.655
You have done well.
- Indeed.

01:30.931 --> 01:33.686
Now you must
ensure that it was not in vain.

01:33.753 --> 01:35.053
You doubt me?

01:35.210 --> 01:38.219
And when Ariadne is dead?
- Do not worry.

01:40.488 --> 01:42.670
You will have your place in my court.

01:54.137 --> 01:55.754
I wish I had your faith in him.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.360
Do not fear.
Telemon is an exile in search of a home.

02:00.507 --> 02:03.622
He will do anything to belong again.
- Even kill a Queen?

02:05.720 --> 02:06.920
Even that.

02:31.136 --> 02:33.470
You have done well.
- There is more.

02:33.520 --> 02:34.865
Well, go on, then.

02:36.005 --> 02:37.483
You have bled me dry.

02:41.160 --> 02:44.164
Give me the benefit of your wisdom.
What else have you learnt?

02:45.920 --> 02:49.459
He sleeps with one eye open.

02:51.496 --> 02:54.765
What use is that to me?
Come back here. I'll tan your hide.

02:59.831 --> 03:01.070
You were right.

03:02.635 --> 03:05.331
Prince Telemon's been out of the city.
- All night.

03:05.880 --> 03:07.252
Doing what?

03:08.328 --> 03:10.060
I cannot say.

03:14.880 --> 03:17.136
I made this journey but a week ago.

03:17.400 --> 03:19.950
It would be foolish to enter
King Agenor's territory.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.310
King Agenor has always thought
highly of Atlantis.

03:22.360 --> 03:24.503
What of his relationship with my father?

03:24.690 --> 03:26.457
I know nothing of this.

03:26.600 --> 03:30.666
I would prefer not to make this
journey at all.

03:30.729 --> 03:33.690
What are you suggesting?
- The Queen remains in Atlantis.

03:33.736 --> 03:35.597
Well, then there can be no wedding.

03:36.436 --> 03:38.746
I must have my father's blessing.

03:38.960 --> 03:42.449
After everything that has gone between
us, it is of utmost importance to me.

03:46.120 --> 03:47.452
We travel to Aegina.

03:48.951 --> 03:50.151
As you wish.

03:51.840 --> 03:53.724
Might I make a suggestion?

03:54.511 --> 03:56.226
We go by way of Phyria.

03:56.960 --> 03:59.304
The Colcheans will have no
patrols in the desert.

03:59.600 --> 04:01.743
I will give it some consideration.

04:02.848 --> 04:05.518
But I alone will know the chosen route.

04:05.920 --> 04:07.201
It is as I have asked.

04:10.640 --> 04:12.040
As you wish.

04:16.079 --> 04:19.017
I cannot let her travel to Aegina
unaware of the potential danger.

04:19.160 --> 04:22.390
Jason. You cannot burst in there
with wild accusations.

04:22.440 --> 04:25.030
Whatever else Telemon is, he is a prince.

04:25.080 --> 04:26.910
And Ariadne's betrothed.

04:26.960 --> 04:29.470
Do you trust him?
- That's hardly the point.

04:29.520 --> 04:32.760
With no proof, it's just
going to look like...

04:35.785 --> 04:36.985
Like what?

04:37.788 --> 04:39.498
Like you're jealous.

04:39.610 --> 04:41.600
Without evidence,
Ariadne will have no choice

04:41.760 --> 04:43.550
but to dismiss your claims.

04:43.600 --> 04:44.910
What?
Do we just let her go?

04:44.960 --> 04:46.160
I see no other way.

05:02.434 --> 05:03.634
Please.

05:06.280 --> 05:09.553
Thank you for granting me
a private audience.

05:09.992 --> 05:11.472
Come, let us walk.

05:12.720 --> 05:15.576
The journey to Aegina is
fraught with danger.

05:15.945 --> 05:20.656
I am only thinking of your safety
when I ask you to reconsider.

05:21.978 --> 05:23.718
The route has been carefully planned.

05:23.779 --> 05:26.077
Not just the route.
The destination.

05:27.165 --> 05:28.442
The match.

05:29.480 --> 05:31.846
Are you sure you can trust this man?

05:32.600 --> 05:35.984
An alliance with Aegina will secure
a future for the people of Atlantis.

05:36.054 --> 05:37.910
If Telemon is to be trusted.

05:37.960 --> 05:39.990
Well, I have heard
nothing from our emissary.

05:40.069 --> 05:42.936
Surely if there were a problem...
- What do you know of his past?

05:43.437 --> 05:45.717
Rather more than I do of yours, I suspect.

05:47.280 --> 05:49.725
I know of the troubles
he went through when he was young

05:49.749 --> 05:51.670
and the difficulties he has with his father.

05:51.720 --> 05:53.454
Does he tell you where he goes at night?

05:54.720 --> 05:56.760
You have been spying on him?

05:56.920 --> 06:00.800
I fear for your safety.
- He is my future husband. Not a prisoner.

06:04.840 --> 06:06.840
What's he doing that worries you so?

06:14.280 --> 06:17.650
Jason, I cannot do this.
Atlantis is vulnerable...

06:17.767 --> 06:20.256
I know, I know that and I understand
that you have to marry.

06:20.290 --> 06:21.490
Do you?

06:22.680 --> 06:25.200
I have thought long
and hard about marrying Telemon.

06:26.640 --> 06:29.607
In the middle of the night when it
seems that dawn will never come,

06:29.870 --> 06:32.430
I have paced my chambers, hoping for a sign.

06:34.200 --> 06:37.763
In those moments of conflict,
I always consider what my father would say.

06:40.640 --> 06:43.070
He held Telemon's family in great respect.

06:43.525 --> 06:44.805
Jason.

06:46.240 --> 06:49.879
I cannot be with you. I am sorry.
I truly am. If there were a way...

06:55.547 --> 06:57.227
We must never speak of this again.

06:59.805 --> 07:02.735
My lady, if you don't trust me

07:02.797 --> 07:04.570
enough to advise you,

07:04.800 --> 07:07.320
at least let me protect you on the journey.

07:08.776 --> 07:10.354
You would do this for me?

07:14.040 --> 07:15.680
Then we leave at first light.

07:24.839 --> 07:26.789
You need to pack.
- Where are we going?

07:27.159 --> 07:30.828
To protect the Queen.
You too. We leave at dawn.

07:31.324 --> 07:32.664
For?
- Aegina.

07:32.920 --> 07:35.296
We are accompanying Ariadne to her wedding?

07:36.153 --> 07:38.337
Of course.
- Of course.

07:39.013 --> 07:42.490
How do we protect a man
so stubbornly ruled by his heart?

07:42.800 --> 07:45.565
Presumably the Oracle
foretold such difficulties.

07:45.680 --> 07:46.980
Not to me she didn't.

07:58.360 --> 07:59.960
I am pleased to see you here.

08:00.974 --> 08:02.254
I wouldn't be anywhere else.

09:11.800 --> 09:14.480
No-one will think ill of you
if you decide not to go.

09:38.674 --> 09:39.954
Here you go.

09:50.680 --> 09:52.600
Tell me something of your father.

09:54.280 --> 09:55.976
What is it you wish to know?

09:56.560 --> 09:59.889
His likes, dislikes.
What makes him happy?

10:00.240 --> 10:01.440
Everything.

10:02.459 --> 10:04.659
Meeting you will make him happy.

10:07.328 --> 10:08.728
You needn't worry so.

10:09.520 --> 10:11.360
But you parted on bad terms.

10:15.320 --> 10:17.800
And he cannot fail to see
how I have changed.

10:19.105 --> 10:21.447
I am sure he will attribute
much of that to you.

10:22.360 --> 10:24.080
I cannot claim that honour.

10:26.880 --> 10:28.477
I think you can.

10:31.154 --> 10:32.354
More than you know.

10:35.880 --> 10:37.819
I will feel better once the sun has risen.

10:38.200 --> 10:40.637
Apparently, he sleeps with one eye open.

10:41.920 --> 10:43.120
As do we.

10:43.362 --> 10:46.244
I will take first watch.
You sleep.

10:53.440 --> 10:55.390
The next stage is surely the most perilous.

10:55.783 --> 10:58.503
I fear so.
But I have made my decision.

10:59.874 --> 11:03.431
We move into the desert and follow
the course of the Phyria gorge.

11:09.640 --> 11:11.350
You are a long way from the fire.

11:11.977 --> 11:13.823
I'm sorry.
I forgot myself.

11:16.095 --> 11:17.855
I feel safer with you here.

11:18.800 --> 11:21.122
I will feel safer
when you are back by the fire.

11:22.870 --> 11:24.110
My lady.

11:40.920 --> 11:43.092
As far as I can tell,
he's not up to anything.

11:43.760 --> 11:46.023
Perhaps this journey
will end safely after all.

11:46.120 --> 11:47.390
Perhaps.

11:47.625 --> 11:50.448
If it does, I think
we should find you another woman.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.806
There are other women.
- Really?

11:54.760 --> 11:56.510
Hercules will find you one.

11:56.560 --> 11:59.926
Oh, yes, I am spectacularly
good at that kind of thing.

12:00.240 --> 12:03.510
Putting aside the fact that my love
sits cursed in a cave,

12:03.560 --> 12:04.779
I'd be happy to help.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.870
Thank you, but I actually
don't think it's such a bad thing

12:07.920 --> 12:10.769
being on your own.
- Oh, absolutely, I agree.

12:11.040 --> 12:12.913
Have you ever known anything else?

12:13.120 --> 12:14.360
That's beside the point.

12:29.080 --> 12:30.372
What happened?

12:30.520 --> 12:32.563
Nothing. He slept.

12:32.800 --> 12:34.110
You slept?

12:34.160 --> 12:37.440
No, I didn't. The whole night.
I watched. He slept.

12:38.480 --> 12:40.750
We must leave no trace of the camp.

12:40.800 --> 12:42.000
Of course.

13:12.733 --> 13:14.070
We go through Phyria?

13:14.120 --> 13:15.370
Mm-hmm.

13:15.598 --> 13:16.848
Is that wise?

13:16.920 --> 13:20.760
I believe it is the last path the
Colcheans will expect us to take.

13:34.600 --> 13:37.280
He has done well.
The message is clear.

13:39.880 --> 13:41.870
They are heading south, across the desert.

13:42.138 --> 13:44.230
They will reach the Phyria gorge
before sunset.

13:44.280 --> 13:45.875
Make sure your men are ready.

13:46.400 --> 13:48.480
Now, do you doubt Telemon's loyalty?

14:03.520 --> 14:07.430
I know what you're thinking.
This route wasn't chosen lightly.

14:08.245 --> 14:09.445
I'm sure.

14:10.433 --> 14:13.017
No bandit would dare attack
a convoy this size.

14:13.440 --> 14:15.040
Can we not pass by the north?

14:16.400 --> 14:18.912
The last we heard,
it was overrun with Colcheans.

16:05.963 --> 16:08.113
We have to get her to safety straightaway.

16:08.547 --> 16:09.827
Help me.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.720
This is what you wanted all along.

16:16.640 --> 16:18.120
What are you waiting for?

16:22.120 --> 16:23.520
Forgive me.

16:33.760 --> 16:35.080
Head for the rocks.

16:39.880 --> 16:43.040
Ariadne. Come on.
Run.

17:02.687 --> 17:04.988
Ariadne, look at me.

17:10.098 --> 17:12.358
Thank the Gods you are safe.
- Did you see them?

17:12.652 --> 17:14.692
Colcheans?
- It looks that way.

17:21.773 --> 17:23.523
I shouldn't have doubted you.

17:23.925 --> 17:25.325
You had your reasons.

17:45.080 --> 17:46.530
Is it done?

17:47.348 --> 17:48.944
It was carnage.

17:50.120 --> 17:51.470
There are many dead.

17:51.520 --> 17:53.914
And Ariadne?
What of the Queen?

17:54.609 --> 17:56.777
I do not know.
- But you killed her?

17:57.360 --> 17:58.630
If you had been there...

17:58.680 --> 18:01.320
I would have remembered the task
I had to do.

18:07.163 --> 18:09.673
In the heat of the moment,
decisions have to be made.

18:09.880 --> 18:12.560
So you decided to let her go?

18:18.640 --> 18:21.000
My Lady, he is of royal blood.

18:22.769 --> 18:27.119
I am the son of a King.
Apollo's servant on earth.

18:27.240 --> 18:29.320
Why risk the fury of the Gods?

18:37.076 --> 18:40.099
If you leave me here, I will die.
- That is for the Gods to decide.

18:41.720 --> 18:45.000
We must travel to the gorge to
ensure Ariadne is dead.

18:55.440 --> 18:57.227
I will find you.

18:58.120 --> 18:59.400
I will not forget.

19:14.600 --> 19:17.640
We must make a break for it
whilst we have cover of darkness.

19:21.084 --> 19:22.804
They're preparing to attack.

19:25.720 --> 19:27.400
Hand me a weapon.

19:32.720 --> 19:34.520
Draw the arrow to your eye.

19:36.680 --> 19:38.480
Here they come.

20:12.520 --> 20:14.580
Where did you learn to shoot like that?

20:15.200 --> 20:16.860
My father taught me.

20:17.723 --> 20:20.602
He believed that everyone should
know how to defend themselves.

20:21.645 --> 20:22.900
Sorry...

20:25.080 --> 20:28.547
We would sneak out of the citadel early
in the morning and head to the forest.

20:29.880 --> 20:32.495
It was one of the only times
we were ever alone.

20:34.680 --> 20:35.880
You miss him.

20:37.080 --> 20:38.480
More than you know.

20:41.652 --> 20:45.687
There... You'll live. For now.

20:48.683 --> 20:50.990
There are scores of them.
I can see their torches.

20:51.040 --> 20:52.707
It's barely an hour before dawn.

20:54.680 --> 20:58.485
I fear we must leave everything
if we are to escape unnoticed.

22:14.200 --> 22:15.400
Dion.

22:20.840 --> 22:22.440
Get back.
In there.

22:27.159 --> 22:28.389
We were so close.

22:29.558 --> 22:30.878
We need to keep moving.

22:34.360 --> 22:36.704
I left anything that might be
useful back there.

22:37.080 --> 22:38.280
Pass me that water.

22:41.320 --> 22:43.572
Le's go while we still have a chance.

22:43.748 --> 22:45.748
It will stop the bleeding.
For now.

23:31.880 --> 23:34.776
We can't stay here.
Come on.

24:06.400 --> 24:07.720
Over here.

24:15.259 --> 24:16.459
It's not her.

24:16.555 --> 24:18.899
One of the archers saw a group
fleeing the gorge.

24:19.292 --> 24:21.391
They tried to stop them, but...
- And Ariadne?

24:21.594 --> 24:24.164
I fear she was amongst them.
- Which direction did they go?

24:24.200 --> 24:26.023
North.
I doubt they will survive for long.

24:26.087 --> 24:28.769
And you think we should leave it to chance?
- No, my lady.

24:45.000 --> 24:46.200
That's the last of it.

24:47.280 --> 24:49.892
Without rest and water,
he will most certainly die.

24:50.320 --> 24:51.920
Then we must rest.

24:53.120 --> 24:54.323
Jason...

24:55.808 --> 24:57.008
Jason.

25:01.360 --> 25:03.190
You must get the Queen to safety.

25:03.646 --> 25:05.646
Not until you're ready to move again.

25:06.820 --> 25:08.585
I am not long for this world.

25:08.813 --> 25:10.553
I am not leaving you here.

25:11.576 --> 25:12.776
I will only slow you down.

25:12.815 --> 25:14.335
Then I'll take that chance.

25:17.640 --> 25:19.455
He wanted you to leave him here?

25:21.760 --> 25:24.362
I knew there would come a point
when he'd ask that of you.

25:24.880 --> 25:26.980
He is thinking only of your safety.

25:27.020 --> 25:28.660
And I knew you would refuse.

25:30.600 --> 25:32.897
We would gain very little,
crossing the desert...

25:32.920 --> 25:34.920
You do not have to justify yourself to me.

25:35.924 --> 25:37.804
I wouldn't have it any other way.

25:41.680 --> 25:43.298
They're badly wounded.

25:44.216 --> 25:46.280
It cannot be long
since they passed this way.

25:48.480 --> 25:51.640
When we find them, leave Ariadne for me.

25:54.440 --> 25:58.238
It is possible to survive
for a number of days without water.

25:58.400 --> 25:59.550
Really?

25:59.600 --> 26:01.416
Providing you rest...
- Rest?

26:01.514 --> 26:04.017
And stay out of the sun.

26:05.720 --> 26:07.122
Should be all right, then.

26:07.169 --> 26:08.725
And without either of those things,

26:08.846 --> 26:10.975
we'll be dead in a couple of days.
- Impossible.

26:11.016 --> 26:14.126
I intend to die with a beautiful
woman in one hand,

26:14.316 --> 26:16.076
and a jug of ale in the other.

26:16.659 --> 26:18.761
And you're going to look for them now?

26:18.786 --> 26:21.019
No, I'm going to look for a somewhere to...

26:22.035 --> 26:23.635
contemplate my existence.

26:30.200 --> 26:32.464
I'm not sure that I deserve such loyalty.

26:33.080 --> 26:35.960
No, you almost certainly do not.

26:38.360 --> 26:39.706
Be serious.

26:40.120 --> 26:42.680
I think Pythagoras covered the serious part.

26:45.306 --> 26:48.066
In a couple of days, we'll be dead.

26:49.840 --> 26:53.980
And actually, what he didn't mention was they
will be the most agonising days of your life.

26:57.680 --> 26:59.436
Is that serious enough?

27:02.440 --> 27:03.640
Look.

27:05.800 --> 27:07.189
Colcheans.

27:07.235 --> 27:09.985
No, travellers of some sort.

27:10.306 --> 27:11.857
We may be saved after all.

27:12.187 --> 27:13.387
Or slaughtered.

27:14.520 --> 27:16.538
I'm just saying,
they might not be friendly.

27:18.560 --> 27:20.449
I think we'll have to take that chance.

27:31.320 --> 27:32.520
They're turning.

27:59.320 --> 28:03.350
Please forgive us.
Our journey has made us wary of strangers.

28:04.402 --> 28:06.354
Even though we desperately need your help.

28:07.400 --> 28:08.640
What of your friend?

28:11.720 --> 28:15.230
I fear he will not survive much longer.
We were attacked...

28:15.280 --> 28:16.920
We were attacked by robbers.

28:18.080 --> 28:20.345
We are on our way to Paros, but

28:20.423 --> 28:22.623
without provisions
we will not make the journey.

28:22.689 --> 28:24.879
If you could escort us to the nearest town.

28:25.000 --> 28:26.760
We would for ever be in your debt.

28:26.876 --> 28:29.460
The goddess would not wish us
to abandon them.

28:32.554 --> 28:35.062
We are bound for the Sanctuary
of Isis at Philae.

28:36.840 --> 28:38.400
You are welcome to journey with us.

28:39.760 --> 28:41.240
We are most grateful.

28:45.360 --> 28:48.630
Tell me, what takes you to Paros?

28:49.250 --> 28:52.550
We are merchants,
we're trying to sell our wares.

28:52.600 --> 28:53.960
Not that any remain.

28:55.155 --> 28:58.065
And the lady?
She is your wife?

28:58.115 --> 28:59.315
No.

29:02.080 --> 29:04.840
Then you are brave indeed to
make such a journey.

29:09.800 --> 29:11.558
What do you sell?

29:11.880 --> 29:14.640
Oh, er, pots...
Cooking pots.

29:16.040 --> 29:18.990
You were most unlucky to have

29:19.040 --> 29:22.247
so many cumbersome objects stolen from you.

29:23.080 --> 29:24.320
Indeed.

29:34.760 --> 29:36.790
Horses...
- It's not possible.

29:36.840 --> 29:39.355
There are more of them.
- They are headed for the mountains.

29:39.388 --> 29:42.748
It is of no matter.
We should catch them by nightfall.

29:49.840 --> 29:51.040
Aargh.

29:54.429 --> 29:55.630
Dear.

29:56.616 --> 30:01.754
Thank you. I shall feel happier
when we are on sturdier terrain.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.200
As will I.

30:04.240 --> 30:08.513
You will be happier when you
have your Queen safely home.

30:10.040 --> 30:14.187
Don't worry, your secret is safe with me.

30:14.520 --> 30:15.870
How did you know?

30:15.920 --> 30:19.711
Orpheus may be blind but he sees
more than any man I have ever known.

30:21.080 --> 30:23.344
Your journey is a long and arduous one.

30:23.720 --> 30:25.073
It is our choice.

30:25.280 --> 30:28.125
Only in suffering
can we find our true selves.

30:28.600 --> 30:30.080
Why does it have to be that way?

30:32.462 --> 30:34.422
Would that it were different.

30:35.480 --> 30:39.615
There is great sadness in your heart.

30:40.702 --> 30:42.964
You have suffered much for one so young.

30:43.565 --> 30:45.350
You speak as if you know me.

30:45.400 --> 30:46.680
It is his gift.

30:48.880 --> 30:52.780
The mantle that you've inherited
weighs heavy on your soul...

30:54.840 --> 30:56.422
but it will not always be so.

30:56.600 --> 31:00.150
Though he may not have known it,
Minos prepared you

31:00.200 --> 31:02.268
well for the task ahead.

31:02.400 --> 31:04.047
You knew my father?

31:05.600 --> 31:07.960
I was sad to hear of his demise.

31:09.920 --> 31:12.790
Fortunately, there are very few
people on this earth

31:12.840 --> 31:14.773
consumed by pure evil.

31:16.040 --> 31:17.722
Pasiphae is one.

31:20.157 --> 31:22.237
Why couldn't he see that?

31:22.800 --> 31:27.520
Sometimes, we are blind to those
we hold dearest.

32:12.400 --> 32:16.280
Here we go, old friend,
I won't let this meal be your last.

32:24.280 --> 32:25.950
I am not sure I am hungry.

32:26.000 --> 32:27.360
But you will eat.

32:28.680 --> 32:29.920
Your Highness.

32:37.280 --> 32:39.560
Pasiphae will stop at nothing
until I am dead.

32:42.600 --> 32:44.899
And you know what the strange thing is?

32:46.000 --> 32:47.800
That doesn't scare me any more.

32:49.240 --> 32:51.750
You must have great faith
in your protectors.

32:51.800 --> 32:53.092
Indeed I do.

32:55.560 --> 32:57.613
If I fear anything, it is their safety.

32:59.468 --> 33:01.657
Maybe we should stay with the pilgrims,

33:02.522 --> 33:04.123
give our lives to the Gods.

33:05.123 --> 33:06.870
It seems to have served them well.

33:08.960 --> 33:11.160
Do you think we will live to be that old?

33:12.440 --> 33:13.640
I don't know.

33:30.520 --> 33:34.880
Tell me, is it a starry night?

33:36.080 --> 33:38.604
Indeed.
- I thought so.

33:39.994 --> 33:41.480
The air is clear.

33:42.640 --> 33:43.840
Peaceful.

33:45.531 --> 33:47.642
Would that it could stay that way.

33:50.880 --> 33:52.997
Here...
Let me help you.

33:57.192 --> 34:00.372
I am grateful for everything
you have done for us.

34:02.360 --> 34:04.926
I just fear that we will
only bring you trouble.

34:07.248 --> 34:10.730
That is as may be.
Some things cannot be avoided.

34:14.840 --> 34:19.512
Our paths have been fated to cross
since the dawn of time.

34:21.280 --> 34:24.516
No seer can really tell
another man's moira...

34:26.641 --> 34:29.754
but I sense

34:30.400 --> 34:33.831
that your momentous
journey has only just begun,

34:34.440 --> 34:37.880
and that it will live
long in the hearts of men.

34:41.920 --> 34:45.734
Tell me, does it end well?

34:48.632 --> 34:50.032
That I cannot answer.

34:51.639 --> 34:53.719
But do not see it as a burden.

34:55.800 --> 34:58.120
The Gods mean it as a gift.

35:07.840 --> 35:09.040
Thank you.

35:10.320 --> 35:13.215
I doubt your suitor is
allowed to keep you warm.

35:14.443 --> 35:16.763
I have seen the looks that pass between you.

35:18.335 --> 35:19.718
I'm speaking out of turn.

35:20.880 --> 35:22.096
Do not fear.

35:22.825 --> 35:25.728
I am but a humble merchant
and you may address me as such.

35:27.800 --> 35:29.550
Would that were true.

35:29.600 --> 35:31.274
You would give it all up for him?

35:32.760 --> 35:33.960
No.

35:35.400 --> 35:37.195
My people come first.

35:37.420 --> 35:40.740
Love is a force as destructive
as it is harmonious.

35:41.120 --> 35:46.198
If I have learned one thing,
it is that it cannot be denied.

35:46.760 --> 35:48.961
Sometimes, it is necessary to deny it.

35:50.707 --> 35:53.747
Bless you, my child, you have much to learn.

36:24.410 --> 36:25.465
Here.

36:25.490 --> 36:27.535
I don't know how.
- Don't be a fool. Take it.

36:32.545 --> 36:33.825
Go. Go.

36:44.440 --> 36:46.739
Get the others out of here.
I'll try and hold them off.

36:46.764 --> 36:47.964
We must move.

37:06.960 --> 37:09.600
He cannot continue this way.
- Him and me both.

37:13.360 --> 37:15.430
Don't even think about it.
- But it's...

37:15.480 --> 37:17.910
I'm still having nightmares
about one-eyed monsters.

37:17.960 --> 37:19.560
We wait for the others here.

37:52.746 --> 37:54.270
I thought I told you to flee.

37:54.582 --> 37:57.490
Well, luckily for you,
I don't like being told what to do.

38:03.320 --> 38:06.175
Jason. Jason.
How many remain?

38:06.451 --> 38:07.675
Too many.

38:10.344 --> 38:11.984
We'll take shelter in there.

38:12.800 --> 38:14.800
Why is it always caves?

38:56.040 --> 38:57.526
What is this place?

38:57.880 --> 38:59.439
Look at the carvings.

39:00.080 --> 39:01.280
They're tombs.

39:02.441 --> 39:03.641
Hipparghos.

39:04.465 --> 39:08.584
It is the ancient necropolis
of King Hipparghos.

39:09.760 --> 39:11.060
We should move on.

39:25.560 --> 39:29.070
The trail leads to the necropolis,
half a dozen or so made it inside.

39:29.120 --> 39:30.430
And Ariadne is with them?

39:30.480 --> 39:32.510
I do not know for sure
but we can presume so.

39:32.560 --> 39:34.110
Then, why are your men idle?

39:34.160 --> 39:36.790
They will not venture inside, my lady.
- What?

39:36.847 --> 39:38.982
I will speak to them.
- It will do no good.

39:39.218 --> 39:43.208
They believe no man who enters
the necropolis ever returns.

39:53.640 --> 39:56.421
You may find your death in the necropolis

39:57.485 --> 39:59.859
or you may meet it here.

40:02.160 --> 40:03.600
Who will follow me?

40:07.720 --> 40:10.230
Perhaps this will help make up your minds.

40:10.280 --> 40:11.480
Bring him here.

40:26.920 --> 40:28.640
Who is still afraid?

40:37.584 --> 40:39.408
Then we will face them alone.

40:45.960 --> 40:47.693
It's time now.

40:49.600 --> 40:51.270
You no longer need me.

40:51.320 --> 40:53.040
I will always need you.

40:54.520 --> 40:56.764
You are capable of more than you know.

41:46.880 --> 41:48.130
No.

41:57.200 --> 41:58.470
Jason.

42:13.440 --> 42:14.720
Pythagoras.

42:16.080 --> 42:17.302
Go, go, go.

42:18.215 --> 42:20.396
What are those things?
- Why won't they die?
