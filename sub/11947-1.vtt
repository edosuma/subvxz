02:19.389 --> 02:22.307
Watch yourselves. Watch out there!

02:30.859 --> 02:32.067
Hello, hello.

02:32.235 --> 02:34.236
Either hurry up or let the man pass.

02:34.404 --> 02:37.156
Partner, these people
have come a long way, too,

02:37.323 --> 02:40.576
so I know you won't mind
them going ahead. Ma'am.

02:44.414 --> 02:49.251
- Watch your step, ma'am.
- Excuse me. I'm next.

02:55.758 --> 02:58.635
Old people should go last
or get the hell out of the way.

02:59.762 --> 03:03.599
I'm so sorry, Mr. Quigley.
We seem to be holding that man up.

03:03.766 --> 03:07.311
No, ma'am. I just spoke to him, and
he ain't in that big a hurry after all.

03:23.870 --> 03:25.370
Come on!

03:30.460 --> 03:33.378
- Where are you from, mate?
- Wyoming.

03:33.546 --> 03:36.632
- That near Sydney?
- Bit further north.

03:37.926 --> 03:41.386
Hey. I can tell you're a bloke
who's looking for somebody.

03:41.554 --> 03:44.306
- No? Something?
- I could use a good horse.

03:44.807 --> 03:47.559
It's a gentleman from the land of
the free and the home of the brave.

03:47.727 --> 03:48.644
A drink, sir?

03:48.811 --> 03:51.647
A place to rest your bones?
A woman, perhaps?

04:08.998 --> 04:10.165
Ow!

04:11.000 --> 04:11.959
Oh!

04:16.464 --> 04:19.216
You're asking for bloody trouble
mixing in with this lot.

04:19.384 --> 04:23.095
I don't reckon the lady's
all that anxious to get in your wagon.

04:23.721 --> 04:26.515
Roy? Oh, Roy, it's you!

04:28.685 --> 04:30.978
- I'm not Roy, lady.
- Every time there's a ship from America

04:31.145 --> 04:34.731
I come down here looking for you.
Thank God you've come for me!

04:34.899 --> 04:38.026
I'm sorry, Roy. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry for everything.

04:39.195 --> 04:40.946
Does Crazy Cora belong to you?

04:41.864 --> 04:44.700
Didn't say that. I said
she don't wanna get in your wagon.

04:47.870 --> 04:50.122
The boss says we can
take some white tarts back,

04:50.290 --> 04:52.708
'cause we're sick of black ladies.

04:52.875 --> 04:56.920
So you just tell Cora to come quiet, and
we'll feed her regular and everything.

04:57.088 --> 04:58.880
Please take me home, Roy.

05:06.055 --> 05:07.264
Bugger off, mate.

05:10.643 --> 05:12.060
Excuse me.

05:19.819 --> 05:23.613
I'm new here,
so I ain't rightly certain.

05:25.116 --> 05:27.743
Is everybody in this country
as butt ugly as you three?

05:37.086 --> 05:38.045
What do you want?

05:38.212 --> 05:41.131
Give him another one!

05:41.299 --> 05:43.633
Don't let the bugger
get behind you, mate!

05:44.427 --> 05:45.552
Back for more, he is?

05:50.850 --> 05:51.975
Look out, Roy.

05:54.187 --> 05:55.604
Sorry, Roy!

06:20.963 --> 06:24.132
- You stay out of this!
- I'm sorry, Roy.

06:24.300 --> 06:26.259
My name ain't Roy.
It's Matthew Quigley.

06:28.054 --> 06:29.471
You?

06:30.598 --> 06:33.058
You're the fella Marston
sent us to bring back.

06:33.226 --> 06:36.228
We sure showed 'em.
Didn't we, Roy?

06:50.410 --> 06:53.245
You got somethin' against
ridin' horses in this country?

06:53.413 --> 06:57.249
We ride 'em when it suits us.
Bullocks eat and drink rougher.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.292
You can put your saddle
on one of them, if you like.

07:03.840 --> 07:06.633
Riding in the back of the wagon
with the women.

07:06.801 --> 07:08.385
I should've known to bring my own horse.

07:10.346 --> 07:13.098
- I wasn't talking to you.
-  Don't worry, Roy.

07:13.266 --> 07:14.975
Everything's gonna turn out just fine.

07:57.810 --> 07:59.769
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna bandage your head.

07:59.937 --> 08:02.189
- No you're not.
- It must hurt real bad.

08:02.356 --> 08:04.566
- I wanna help it get better.
- Quit!

08:06.402 --> 08:08.653
You've helped me enough already.

08:10.907 --> 08:12.449
I'm much obliged.

08:19.707 --> 08:22.709
I don't know why you're being
such a big baby about this, Roy.

08:22.877 --> 08:24.085
Just hold still.

08:24.253 --> 08:27.047
Quit! Now who the hell
is this Roy, anyway?

08:27.215 --> 08:30.175
Hey! Do you need a hand
with Crazy Cora?

08:42.438 --> 08:44.105
Here.

08:45.441 --> 08:46.650
Thank you.

08:50.780 --> 08:54.824
Look, lady. I don't know no Roy,
so you just leave me alone.

09:05.419 --> 09:06.419
Go on.

09:22.520 --> 09:23.562
Yoo-hoo.

09:27.024 --> 09:28.024
Good night, Roy.

09:32.238 --> 09:33.738
Good night, lady.

10:32.048 --> 10:35.300
- What the bloody hell is it?
- Redcoats.

10:35.968 --> 10:38.511
Mr. Ashley-Bloody-Pitt and his heroes.

10:42.558 --> 10:44.934
- Friends of yours?
- They're British.

11:11.754 --> 11:13.922
Get that bloody thing
away from my team!

11:14.090 --> 11:15.632
Why are you taking the body back?

11:16.258 --> 11:19.386
We've got orders to bring in
all suspected cattle thieves.

11:19.553 --> 11:23.348
- The bugger's dead.
- The trial will not be lengthy.

11:23.516 --> 11:27.936
- Carry on, sergeant.
- We're looking for two deserters.

11:28.104 --> 11:31.231
- Can't say I blame 'em.
- Have you seen 'em?

11:32.775 --> 11:36.027
- No.
- New distractions?

11:36.195 --> 11:38.947
Who's this chap on the back here?

11:39.115 --> 11:43.201
- The Yank Marston's brought out.
- Yank?

11:43.369 --> 11:48.415
Come to do for Marston what these
bog-lrish convicts obviously can't.

11:48.582 --> 11:51.418
Well, you just do yourjob
and stay out of trouble.

11:51.585 --> 11:56.131
In our experience,
Americans are uncouth misfits

11:56.298 --> 11:59.217
who have been run out
of their own barbaric country.

12:00.928 --> 12:02.637
- Well, lieutenant...
- Major!

12:05.224 --> 12:10.061
Major, we already run
the misfits out of our country.

12:12.314 --> 12:13.815
We sent 'em back to England.

12:48.517 --> 12:51.102
What are they, koala bears?

12:52.229 --> 12:54.355
Kangaroos, I reckon.

12:56.233 --> 13:00.195
Well, whatever they are, Roy, nature
sure played an awful trick on 'em.

13:00.362 --> 13:04.407
I am fed up with you.
And I am fed up with Roy, whoever he is.

13:04.575 --> 13:09.537
- My name is Matthew.
- Well, pardon the hell outta me.

13:09.705 --> 13:12.123
I can't believe you would
talk to me like that, Roy.

13:12.291 --> 13:14.751
I oughta wash your mouth out
with soap if I had some.

13:14.919 --> 13:17.045
Lady, you are about
half a bubble off the plumb,

13:17.213 --> 13:19.047
and that's for sure and for certain.

13:19.215 --> 13:24.052
Just because the road is rocky, doesn't
mean your spirits should get rocky, too.

13:26.680 --> 13:28.765
When do we get to Marston's ranch?

13:28.933 --> 13:31.935
Been on his bloody land
for the last two days.

14:07.638 --> 14:09.097
Things seem different here.

14:10.599 --> 14:14.269
They say God made Australia last,
don't you know?

14:14.436 --> 14:18.064
After he got tired of making
everything else the same.

14:18.941 --> 14:21.943
Well, I've seen some pretty country,
that's for certain.

14:25.906 --> 14:28.491
What are you doing so far from home?

14:34.373 --> 14:36.541
There hasn't been anyone else but you.

14:38.460 --> 14:40.128
You know that, don't you?

14:43.132 --> 14:45.717
You can take me if you want to, Roy.

14:46.468 --> 14:49.304
God Almighty, lady. Go to sleep.

15:34.058 --> 15:35.725
Whoo-hoo!

15:56.455 --> 15:57.747
Hey, look at that.

16:31.365 --> 16:33.366
Hey-up!

16:36.578 --> 16:37.745
Good to see you.

16:39.081 --> 16:42.000
Get back to work.
Here you go, lads.

16:44.545 --> 16:46.754
Wait till you see
what we've got for you.

16:48.590 --> 16:50.216
Matthew Quigley.

16:51.552 --> 16:54.012
Elliott Marston. Welcome to Australia.

16:54.596 --> 16:56.681
Well, sir, your men already welcomed me.

16:59.601 --> 17:03.479
Coogan, Mr. Quigley's luggage.
Take it to the lodge.

17:09.319 --> 17:12.155
Mr. Marston, you said you'd
pay me 50 dollars in gold coin

17:12.321 --> 17:14.949
- just for showing up.
- You don't waste much time.

17:15.117 --> 17:17.201
I spent three months on a boat
just gettin' here.

17:20.414 --> 17:22.330
You intrigued me, Mr. Quigley.

17:23.959 --> 17:26.961
Twenty-one men answered my
advertisement, from all over the world.

17:27.921 --> 17:30.131
Canada, India, England.

17:31.550 --> 17:33.176
They just wrote letters.

17:33.343 --> 17:38.556
But you... had a way with words.

17:40.434 --> 17:45.813
My advertisement stated that I wanted to
hire the finest marksman in the world.

17:47.900 --> 17:48.900
Have I?

18:06.168 --> 18:07.668
Uh-huh.

18:09.338 --> 18:11.255
The legendary Sharp.

18:12.174 --> 18:15.468
You know your weapons.
It's a lever-action breech loader.

18:17.638 --> 18:21.224
Usual barrel length's 30 inches.
This one has an extra four.

18:21.391 --> 18:26.020
It's converted to use a special
.45-caliber, 110-grain metal cartridge

18:26.188 --> 18:28.731
with a 540-grain paper-patched bullet.

18:28.899 --> 18:32.860
It's fitted with double set triggers
and a vernier sight.

18:36.198 --> 18:39.742
It's marked up to 1200 yards.
This one shoots a mite further.

18:42.454 --> 18:46.874
An experimental weapon
with experimental ammunition.

18:48.293 --> 18:49.669
You could call it that.

18:51.004 --> 18:52.672
Let's experiment.

18:54.591 --> 18:59.053
Whitey, take that bucket
and ride out until I signal.

19:09.273 --> 19:11.440
Tell me when you want him to stop.

19:26.331 --> 19:29.333
Your man able to hit
something that far away?

19:30.919 --> 19:36.591
I don't know him.
I never saw him before.

19:38.385 --> 19:40.845
He'd have to be a good shot all right.

19:47.269 --> 19:48.644
'Bout there'll do.

19:56.153 --> 19:57.445
Bullshit.

21:03.845 --> 21:06.472
Are you quite certain, Mr. Quigley,

21:08.433 --> 21:11.102
that you wouldn't like
the bucket a bit closer?

21:17.526 --> 21:19.277
Jesus Christ!

21:21.863 --> 21:23.197
Quite certain.

21:38.380 --> 21:42.341
Told you. Only my Roy could
hit a coyote from that distance.

21:53.020 --> 21:56.314
Very impressive. You're hired.

22:04.281 --> 22:06.073
Would you excuse me for a minute?

22:06.241 --> 22:08.409
There's some business
I have to attend to.

22:09.786 --> 22:11.787
You might find this interesting.

22:12.414 --> 22:14.123
Nice shootin', Roy.

22:16.209 --> 22:17.626
Mr. Marston?

22:18.920 --> 22:23.007
I think there's been a mistake.
The one they call Crazy Cora.

22:25.093 --> 22:27.011
I'd appreciate it
if your men leave her alone

22:27.179 --> 22:30.931
- till you and I have a chance to talk.
- Whatever you want.

22:37.814 --> 22:41.150
You are deserters from
Her Majesty's armed forces.

22:41.318 --> 22:43.778
The penalty for your crime is death.

22:43.945 --> 22:46.697
You were caught on my land.
I could have you shot for trespassing.

22:46.865 --> 22:50.493
Look, you let us stay here,
guv'nor, we'll serve you proper.

22:52.120 --> 22:54.121
Better than this
convict scum you've got.

22:54.289 --> 22:58.459
Well, unfortunately, your commanding
officer Major Ashley-Pitt and I

22:58.627 --> 23:01.420
have an understanding,
and so, I'm afraid,

23:01.588 --> 23:03.964
you'll be sent back
to face the firing party.

23:04.132 --> 23:08.302
But I see no reason why you
should be trussed up like animals.

23:09.596 --> 23:11.013
Mr. Dobkin.

24:00.814 --> 24:03.232
This is my preferred weapon,
Mr. Quigley.

24:05.402 --> 24:07.194
Do join me for dinner.

24:18.707 --> 24:21.208
You've got to admit, the Yank's
a damn good shot with a long rifle.

24:21.376 --> 24:23.461
Oh, sure. But you give me
a weapon like that,

24:23.628 --> 24:25.713
and I could beat him with my eyes shut.

24:26.548 --> 24:29.550
Easy to say, O'Flynn.
You've got a lot to learn.

24:30.177 --> 24:33.262
I ain't got a lot to learn. Look at you,
Dobkin. You've been here 12 years,

24:33.430 --> 24:35.806
and all you've got to show for it
is cold mutton.

24:35.974 --> 24:37.808
He's in, getting a fancy dinner.

24:38.810 --> 24:39.810
Huh?

24:41.563 --> 24:44.356
You were actually in Dodge City?

24:46.359 --> 24:48.402
William Hickok must have been there.

24:48.570 --> 24:52.364
Spent a night there once.
I was pretty tired.

24:52.532 --> 24:56.076
Dodge City's a nice place
to get some sleep.

25:00.916 --> 25:03.626
Are you familiar with
the army revolver, Mr. Quigley?

25:06.463 --> 25:09.423
Well, sir, I never had much use for one.

25:10.634 --> 25:13.719
It's a recent invention of
your countryman, Colonel Colt.

25:15.096 --> 25:20.100
God created all men. They say
Sam Colt made 'em equal. More or less.

25:22.395 --> 25:27.274
That's what I like about you Americans.
You're people of action, not words.

25:27.442 --> 25:31.070
That mint jelly on your lamb.

25:32.781 --> 25:34.031
It's my own creation.

25:34.199 --> 25:38.577
No, I'm a student of your American West.
I've read a great deal about it.

25:40.580 --> 25:42.748
Tell me about dingoes.

25:45.085 --> 25:48.128
Ten pounds a month
for shooting wild dogs

25:48.296 --> 25:50.130
seems like a whole lot for not much.

25:51.216 --> 25:54.134
Besides, you got enough men
and guns outside

25:54.302 --> 25:57.179
to kill every dingo
within ten miles of here.

25:58.723 --> 26:00.766
Unless you're talking about deserters.

26:04.479 --> 26:07.022
Did you know that your American Indian

26:07.190 --> 26:10.651
is a race that has no word for "wheel."

26:12.320 --> 26:16.740
No concept of farming.
No understanding of land ownership.

26:18.493 --> 26:19.827
Is that a fact?

26:22.497 --> 26:26.333
From what I hear, you found a solution
to that problem in your country.

26:28.003 --> 26:30.838
I guess that depends on
whether you're an Indian or not.

26:34.843 --> 26:39.972
You see, in many ways...
our two nations are quite similar.

26:41.641 --> 26:45.269
We both brought civilization
to the Stone Age.

26:49.357 --> 26:53.152
Unfortunately, in this country
we have failed in one regard.

26:53.987 --> 26:58.157
We have been unable to domesticate
the most backward people in the world...

26:59.492 --> 27:00.909
...the Australian Aborigine.

27:02.495 --> 27:04.496
Don't mind him. He's harmless.

27:12.714 --> 27:15.382
My parents were slaughtered
by Aborigines, Mr. Quigley.

27:16.926 --> 27:21.430
They attacked so fast my mother
was found dead still holding her sewing.

27:23.183 --> 27:25.684
Nowadays they butcher
our sheep and cattle.

27:25.852 --> 27:28.395
Her Majesty's government
allows the local settlers

27:28.563 --> 27:30.481
to deal with the matter their own way.

27:32.192 --> 27:36.904
It's official policy.
It's called "pacification by force."

27:40.075 --> 27:41.909
But the real issue...

27:43.787 --> 27:46.246
...is that, primitive as they are,

27:46.414 --> 27:50.668
the Aborigines have learned
to keep out of rifle range.

27:54.631 --> 27:58.842
Which brings us to you... Mr. Quigley.

28:03.264 --> 28:04.598
What the hell?

28:09.813 --> 28:12.147
No! Stay right where you are.

28:14.984 --> 28:17.111
No man knocks me out of my own house.

28:31.668 --> 28:33.585
Don't just stand there. Get him.

28:39.008 --> 28:42.636
- Has he got the rifle with him?
- He keeps it right beside him.

28:42.804 --> 28:45.180
I said, get him!

29:05.702 --> 29:07.619
He's just sitting in there
with that big gun.

29:26.431 --> 29:30.642
Keep down. Kelly, up there.
Carver, take the side.

29:33.980 --> 29:35.689
Brophy, around the back.

29:45.200 --> 29:47.075
Fancy American shooter.

29:49.996 --> 29:51.914
Eating real fancy, eh?

30:04.052 --> 30:07.596
Go on, kick him in the back! Give it
to him in the back. Go on, that's it.

30:09.808 --> 30:12.643
Leave Roy alone!

30:13.812 --> 30:15.145
Get her off me!

30:28.785 --> 30:31.954
Throw him in the wagon. Haul him
two days from here and dump him.

30:33.873 --> 30:35.999
Let Australia kill him.

30:38.461 --> 30:39.711
And that crazy woman, too.

32:04.839 --> 32:06.715
You forgot the gold.

32:08.676 --> 32:10.010
What did he say?

32:10.845 --> 32:14.514
- You forgot the gold.
- Marston.

32:16.184 --> 32:17.935
He paid him in gold.

32:19.771 --> 32:20.771
He's right.

32:41.501 --> 32:45.545
Leave us some water
and you can have the gold.

32:46.631 --> 32:50.258
- I can have the gold anyway.
- That's what I thought you'd say.

33:00.728 --> 33:01.728
Yah!

33:04.440 --> 33:05.691
Yah!

33:27.422 --> 33:28.588
Go on!

33:40.435 --> 33:42.060
Come on! Yah!

34:08.713 --> 34:09.795
Yah!

34:43.331 --> 34:45.873
I wish people would quit
hitting me on the head.

34:46.042 --> 34:47.583
Don't worry.

34:47.752 --> 34:51.295
On a new job, it's quite common
for things not to go well at first.

35:24.372 --> 35:26.998
- We should...
- What?

35:29.544 --> 35:33.421
I remember, my granddaddy told me
how, when you're lost in the desert,

35:33.589 --> 35:36.883
you should sleep during the day
and walk at night.

35:37.051 --> 35:39.427
Your granddaddy tell you that?

35:39.595 --> 35:43.598
He also tell you we'll die in the desert
without those horses?

35:43.766 --> 35:47.561
What good are horses if we die first?

35:49.564 --> 35:52.315
Once in a while she actually
makes a little sense.

35:54.652 --> 35:57.863
- What did you say, Roy?
- Never mind.

39:10.639 --> 39:12.182
Good morning, Major.

39:12.350 --> 39:14.225
Marston.

39:17.188 --> 39:20.148
What can I get for you?
Some refreshment?

39:20.316 --> 39:21.983
That's very kind, sir.

39:22.151 --> 39:27.530
I'd be obliged if you would
identify for me two dead bodies.

39:33.954 --> 39:35.663
Two men absconded.

39:35.831 --> 39:38.208
But I imagine this is
a couple of newcomers

39:38.376 --> 39:40.126
who wandered off together, recently.

39:42.254 --> 39:43.671
A man and a woman?

39:48.302 --> 39:52.889
Two men. One has been stabbed
and one shot through the head.

39:53.182 --> 39:54.808
Coogan and Miller.

39:58.813 --> 40:01.981
It would appear that the man
and the woman are still missing.

40:05.778 --> 40:07.695
Yes, it would, wouldn't it?

40:09.365 --> 40:11.157
Don't worry, Major.

40:12.618 --> 40:15.829
I have no doubt I'll find them.

42:10.152 --> 42:11.778
Hey, lady.

42:14.615 --> 42:16.199
You OK?

42:17.117 --> 42:18.618
Think so.

42:26.043 --> 42:28.002
What are they gonna do to us?

42:29.797 --> 42:33.800
I reckon they already done it.
They gave us water.

42:37.388 --> 42:39.472
But that don't make sense.

42:39.640 --> 42:43.810
They let me keep it when every white man
with a rifle's trying to kill 'em.

42:44.895 --> 42:47.647
- Except you.
- They don't know that.

42:47.815 --> 42:49.816
Don't they?

42:49.984 --> 42:53.319
Something tells me you and I
were on the shady side of dead.

42:53.487 --> 42:57.323
This is a special place.
Bet they used magic on us.

42:57.491 --> 43:01.995
That old man over there,
looks like he's... some kind of chief,

43:02.162 --> 43:04.289
or medicine man, or something.

43:04.957 --> 43:07.250
What's this? There.

43:11.338 --> 43:13.965
More than likely something
that came out of the south end

43:14.133 --> 43:17.343
- of a northbound kangaroo.
- You mean kangaroo shit?

43:39.408 --> 43:40.825
Very kind.

43:40.993 --> 43:44.954
- Do you think they're safe to eat?
- You got a better idea?

43:59.511 --> 44:00.511
Much obliged.

44:05.059 --> 44:06.726
Go on.

44:08.395 --> 44:10.688
I don't eat things
that are still moving.

44:13.567 --> 44:15.401
Gonna shoot it first?

44:27.456 --> 44:28.456
Mm-hmm.

44:43.722 --> 44:45.473
- Yo? Yo?
- Yo.

44:46.308 --> 44:48.059
Yo? Yo!

44:48.602 --> 44:49.602
Yo!

44:59.613 --> 45:04.075
After you cut this strip out
of this big piece of kangaroo...

45:05.452 --> 45:07.120
There we go. Take...

45:21.802 --> 45:23.010
Here.

45:36.150 --> 45:38.067
Swing your arm. Just roll your wrist.

45:38.235 --> 45:41.821
You gotta keep that loop open.
See how that loop stays open?

45:41.989 --> 45:45.783
You look at what you're throwing at.
Swing the rope and throw right at it.

45:49.413 --> 45:51.164
Then you just pull him in.

46:46.011 --> 46:48.721
You just wait till you try this.

46:48.889 --> 46:51.724
But you gotta guess what it is.

46:54.102 --> 46:57.438
That little girl is so darling.

47:00.651 --> 47:01.734
She sure is.

47:04.655 --> 47:07.198
Not as darling as Roy Junior.

47:08.325 --> 47:11.285
God Almighty, lady, not another Roy.

47:13.997 --> 47:18.876
I don't know about you, but my stomach
thinks my throat's been cut.

47:21.839 --> 47:25.258
Roy was hunting sage hens
when the Comanches came.

47:27.469 --> 47:32.014
I grabbed the baby and a pistol,
and I hid in the root cellar out back.

47:32.182 --> 47:34.600
The Indians tore up our sod house.

47:34.768 --> 47:37.645
I was real quiet,
but then the baby started crying.

47:37.813 --> 47:41.858
I tried to shush him and suckle him,
but he just wouldn't stop.

47:42.025 --> 47:46.904
One Comanche, I remember, he acted
real drunk and wore my green apron.

47:47.072 --> 47:51.075
He must have heard something.
He started hollering and coming closer.

47:51.243 --> 47:54.245
So I put my hand gentle-like
over my baby's mouth.

47:54.413 --> 47:57.290
"Don't cry. Daddy'll be home soon."

47:59.167 --> 48:02.295
The Indians found us,
but they just laughed.

48:02.462 --> 48:07.466
They was drunk, didn't wanna
hurt anybody, and rode away.

48:09.511 --> 48:15.224
At sundown, Roy came home, but I was
still afraid to come out of the cellar.

48:15.392 --> 48:20.396
I was afraid of what he'd do
when he saw I'd smothered our son.

48:23.650 --> 48:28.362
I ought to find some way
to mend this petticoat. Look at that.

48:39.082 --> 48:41.083
Roy...

48:44.963 --> 48:49.050
He just buried the baby,
put me in the wagon,

48:49.217 --> 48:52.887
and we went 70 miles
to Galveston without stopping.

48:53.055 --> 48:56.307
He never said a word.

48:59.019 --> 49:04.023
Put me on the first ship he found.
It was headed to Australia.

49:07.861 --> 49:09.862
Then he said,

49:10.030 --> 49:14.909
"Don't want no woman that would
kill my son to save herself."

49:17.329 --> 49:20.164
And he turned and he walked away,
and he never looked back.

49:23.377 --> 49:27.129
I know, 'cause I watched
to see if he would.

49:32.052 --> 49:34.762
This thing is just falling apart.

49:37.891 --> 49:39.475
It's just...

50:04.710 --> 50:06.419
I'm tired.

50:51.173 --> 50:53.632
Don't exactly talk your ear off
saying goodbye, do they?

50:56.887 --> 51:00.431
The Johnsons were always like that.

51:01.767 --> 51:03.142
What?

51:03.310 --> 51:05.978
Remember the church social last year?

51:06.146 --> 51:10.149
They ate everybody's jams and pies
and left without saying a word.

51:10.317 --> 51:13.944
It's our own fault for
inviting 'em again this year.

51:14.112 --> 51:16.739
Why would they do that?

51:19.117 --> 51:20.367
That's why.

51:25.874 --> 51:28.918
Oh, no. No!

51:30.003 --> 51:31.921
No. Stay back!

51:46.895 --> 51:48.854
No!

52:03.036 --> 52:03.869
Over there!

52:16.216 --> 52:17.633
No!

52:21.221 --> 52:22.388
Shit.

53:02.596 --> 53:05.598
Of all the damn fool things
I ever did see!

53:05.765 --> 53:08.601
You trying to get your head blown off?

53:18.111 --> 53:22.448
Anyone who believes in magic...
is crazy.

53:30.707 --> 53:33.083
Don't be running off like that.

53:35.128 --> 53:37.504
I could have used
some help up there, you know.

53:42.344 --> 53:44.303
Well, I got my rig back.

53:45.555 --> 53:49.475
But no saddlebags,
which means I can't make my reload.

53:49.976 --> 53:52.978
We got one horse and two canteens.

53:56.816 --> 54:00.986
And a rider got away. Which means
Marston'll know where we are.

54:01.154 --> 54:03.656
Yeah. And we don't.

55:01.715 --> 55:05.509
- I'm cold.
- You got the blanket.

55:10.890 --> 55:13.100
Maybe we could share it tonight.

55:14.102 --> 55:16.395
There's something
I wanna talk to you about.

55:17.897 --> 55:22.318
If we do, there'll be something
I wanna talk to you about.

55:52.807 --> 55:58.687
When summer comes, let's drag up
some wood for a real cabin.

55:58.855 --> 56:02.691
- 'Cause, Roy, sod walls...
- Matthew.

56:09.616 --> 56:11.283
Matthew Quigley.

56:12.452 --> 56:16.538
I ain't sharing my bed till I'm certain
you know who's in it. Now say it.

56:19.376 --> 56:23.128
If we had a wood cabin
we could get glass windows.

56:29.594 --> 56:31.136
We'll see.

56:40.772 --> 56:42.898
The sea's gotta be west.

56:43.066 --> 56:47.486
That's how we're headed,
but you sure wouldn't know it.

56:47.987 --> 56:50.781
Ow! Hell!

56:51.866 --> 56:53.325
Do you see that?

56:53.493 --> 56:56.995
I sure did. Biggest ant I ever did see.

57:02.168 --> 57:04.628
- What's my name today?
- Matthew Quigley,

57:04.796 --> 57:05.838
same as any other day.

57:06.005 --> 57:09.550
How's about you and me taking off
all our clothes and going swimming?

57:12.720 --> 57:15.347
What are you? Crazy?
There ain't no water.

57:18.017 --> 57:19.309
Why, shame on you!

57:20.687 --> 57:23.147
Well, you...
What about last night? You...

57:23.314 --> 57:24.565
I what?

57:29.362 --> 57:31.530
Oh, never mind.

57:41.332 --> 57:45.377
- How's that, then, Mr. Marston?
- Pretty good, O'Flynn. You've improved.

57:45.545 --> 57:48.505
Wear your holster a bit higher,
then grab your gun on the way up.

57:48.673 --> 57:51.216
- But I'm faster, aren't I?
- Yeah.

57:52.510 --> 57:55.721
- Think I'll ever be as fast as you?
- You mean if you practiced a lot?

57:55.889 --> 57:56.889
- Yeah.
- No.

58:06.941 --> 58:08.609
Not again.

58:10.612 --> 58:12.154
Where are the others?

58:13.406 --> 58:15.741
Dead. All dead.

58:15.909 --> 58:18.410
Quigley. He was everywhere.

58:20.246 --> 58:24.708
Four more. I don't believe this.
Did you see him?

58:26.419 --> 58:28.295
- It was too far away.
- How far?

58:28.463 --> 58:31.924
- Three quarters of a mile, maybe.
- That's impossible.

58:32.091 --> 58:36.553
How long from the time the bullet struck
until you heard the report of the rifle?

58:37.764 --> 58:40.265
Two, maybe three seconds.

58:43.811 --> 58:46.897
Matthew Quigley is really
beginning to annoy me.

58:49.400 --> 58:52.444
Dobkin. How many men
can we send out there?

58:54.322 --> 58:58.283
These and two others.
Six men are still on a hunting party.

59:00.119 --> 59:01.453
All right.

59:02.080 --> 59:05.749
There's 50 pounds, in gold,
to the man who brings Quigley in.

59:07.418 --> 59:09.378
So keep practicing.

59:11.130 --> 59:14.633
- If we're lost, you can tell me.
- We're lost.

59:14.801 --> 59:18.804
- I can take bad news. Tell me straight.
- I don't know where the hell we are.

59:18.972 --> 59:21.431
No sense in taking time
to make it sound better than it is.

59:21.599 --> 59:23.684
I reckon we're going in circles.

59:23.851 --> 59:25.852
You flower things up,
I'll see right through it.

59:26.020 --> 59:29.189
So just tell me, honestly, are we lost?

59:31.359 --> 59:34.152
No. I know exactly where we are.

59:34.320 --> 59:38.407
That's good. 'Cause, frankly,
I was getting a little worried.

59:40.118 --> 59:42.995
Don't know where we're going,
but there's no use being late.

59:54.674 --> 59:55.674
Yah!

01:00:07.979 --> 01:00:09.521
Come on!

01:01:07.163 --> 01:01:10.499
Get the bloody hell outta here!
Quick! Come on, hurry up!

01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:44.301
My back's broke.

01:02:45.678 --> 01:02:48.680
Your gut's shot, Hobb.
There ain't nothing I can do for you.

01:02:50.141 --> 01:02:51.933
You can kill me.

01:02:53.853 --> 01:02:56.354
Where's Marston's station from here?

01:02:57.815 --> 01:03:01.693
- How far's the nearest town?
- Why should I tell you?

01:03:01.861 --> 01:03:05.447
'Cause if you don't, I'll let you live.

01:03:15.082 --> 01:03:18.627
You know, I'm new here,
so I'm kinda curious.

01:03:19.545 --> 01:03:23.215
Do you think the dingoes
will get you first? Or the ants?

01:03:26.844 --> 01:03:29.679
Quigley, don't leave me like this!

01:03:31.974 --> 01:03:36.061
Quigley! Marston's station's
two days' ride southwest.

01:03:37.355 --> 01:03:40.023
Meekathanga's only 20 miles
past the billabong.

01:03:40.191 --> 01:03:43.443
Talk straight, Goddamn it!
Or I'll get the ants myself.

01:03:43.611 --> 01:03:48.824
It's a town, a day's ride
past the dry riverbed.

01:03:51.410 --> 01:03:52.869
That way.

01:04:04.882 --> 01:04:06.508
Now finish me.

01:04:20.273 --> 01:04:22.691
You got one shot left in that shooter.

01:04:24.694 --> 01:04:26.236
Make the most of it.

01:05:11.741 --> 01:05:15.535
All right. All right. Sweet thing.

01:05:16.078 --> 01:05:17.913
You're the sweetest little thing.

01:05:18.414 --> 01:05:19.831
Sweet, little thing.

01:05:45.566 --> 01:05:48.401
I reckon we should keep moving
till we find some help.

01:05:48.569 --> 01:05:52.864
I reckon we should stop for the night.
The baby's hurt, weak. He needs shelter.

01:05:53.032 --> 01:05:56.034
The kid's probably tougher than we are.

01:06:12.468 --> 01:06:14.678
That little fella
was eatin' like his bellybutton

01:06:14.845 --> 01:06:17.180
had been rubbing a blister
on his backbone.

01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:22.394
Yeah, he was eating,
but he needs some milk.

01:06:22.561 --> 01:06:25.939
I don't recall seeing a whole
lot of milking cows around here.

01:06:32.071 --> 01:06:34.864
There should be a town
to the southwest.

01:06:39.286 --> 01:06:42.038
I reckon we could make it
in a hard day's ride.

01:06:42.206 --> 01:06:45.208
We can't make it.
He should stay here with me.

01:06:45.376 --> 01:06:48.336
You can make the ride faster without us.

01:06:51.590 --> 01:06:52.841
Well...

01:06:57.555 --> 01:06:59.764
Just leave me
the extra rifle and pistol.

01:07:00.307 --> 01:07:01.850
You know how to use a shooter?

01:07:03.269 --> 01:07:05.520
I am a native-born Texican.

01:07:08.983 --> 01:07:13.945
There's enough water for two days,
if I ain't here drinking it.

01:07:17.783 --> 01:07:19.409
What do you think?

01:07:22.163 --> 01:07:25.248
What? What's the matter?

01:07:27.668 --> 01:07:29.127
You.

01:07:29.295 --> 01:07:33.798
You're the only man on this continent
that would ask me what I think.

01:07:37.970 --> 01:07:41.222
- That ought to do you.
- Thanks for the lizards.

01:07:41.390 --> 01:07:45.310
You've checked the guns three times.
There's food and water. We're fine.

01:07:46.353 --> 01:07:47.979
Get going.

01:07:59.366 --> 01:08:03.995
If you run into any of his own people,
you'll give 'em Little Bit, won't you?

01:08:07.166 --> 01:08:09.334
You gotta promise me.

01:08:12.505 --> 01:08:14.923
Sure could use something else to wear.

01:08:17.009 --> 01:08:19.636
He'd be better off with them.
You know that, don't you?

01:08:19.804 --> 01:08:23.640
If you see any dresses that aren't
too costly, red's my favorite color.

01:08:23.808 --> 01:08:26.684
Red or even pink,
but red's my favorite.

01:08:33.359 --> 01:08:36.569
I should be back in two days.
If I ain't back in three...

01:08:36.737 --> 01:08:39.488
- You'll be back.
- You bet.

01:10:25.346 --> 01:10:28.598
Highly unusual calibration,
Mr. Quigley.

01:10:30.100 --> 01:10:33.311
- This will take some time to duplicate.
- No, sir, it won't.

01:10:33.479 --> 01:10:36.564
You can substitute a 450,
number two British musket lead.

01:10:36.732 --> 01:10:41.277
- Marston ain't gonna wait.
- Marston? He's a murderer.

01:10:41.445 --> 01:10:44.906
He mixes flour with poison
to kill the Aborigines.

01:10:45.074 --> 01:10:49.786
- Yes, this is a cruel, uncivilized...
- Papa. Let the man eat.

01:10:49.954 --> 01:10:52.497
He's got a long ride
ahead of him tonight.

01:10:52.665 --> 01:10:55.917
I was able to find
some condensed milk for the baby

01:10:56.085 --> 01:10:58.753
and tins of beef for you and your woman.

01:10:58.921 --> 01:11:03.091
- Ma'am, she ain't exactly my woman.
- Klaus, come over here.

01:11:03.259 --> 01:11:06.678
Mr. Quigley,
I would like you to meet my son.

01:11:06.845 --> 01:11:08.012
Pleased to meet you.

01:11:08.180 --> 01:11:11.557
I know who you are.
You're the American.

01:11:11.725 --> 01:11:14.269
The one who's been
helping the Aborigines.

01:11:15.187 --> 01:11:17.522
Is that the rifle
I've been hearing about?

01:11:20.150 --> 01:11:22.527
You can take a look at it,
if you'd like, son.

01:11:28.158 --> 01:11:30.451
- It's so heavy.
- Well, you get used to it.

01:11:30.619 --> 01:11:33.413
Son, I hid my horse
in the gully out back.

01:11:33.580 --> 01:11:35.164
I'd be much obliged
if you'd bring it up.

01:11:35.332 --> 01:11:36.791
Yes, sir.

01:11:37.751 --> 01:11:42.714
Klaus, after you get Mr. Quigley's
horse, saddle up ours as well.

01:11:42.881 --> 01:11:44.424
Yes, Papa.

01:11:46.635 --> 01:11:49.053
He didn't get all that
from a "wanted" poster.

01:11:49.221 --> 01:11:51.472
Everyone knows about you.

01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:57.312
The Aborigines who come to town to trade
with us talk about the "spirit warrior."

01:12:00.149 --> 01:12:03.192
I've been called a lot of things,
ma'am... Never that.

01:12:03.736 --> 01:12:05.528
Yeah.

01:12:27.968 --> 01:12:29.385
Get the others.

01:12:29.928 --> 01:12:32.472
Young fella,
where'd you get this saddle?

01:12:51.116 --> 01:12:54.786
Shh!

01:12:54.953 --> 01:12:56.621
Don't cry.

01:12:57.331 --> 01:12:59.040
Daddy'll be home soon.

01:13:31.824 --> 01:13:33.449
Shh! Shh!

01:13:33.617 --> 01:13:36.994
Don't cry. Hush, baby.
Hush, baby. Hush, baby.

01:13:37.162 --> 01:13:38.830
Shh, shh.

01:13:40.582 --> 01:13:43.501
Shh. Daddy'll be home soon. Shh.

01:13:47.714 --> 01:13:50.675
Daddy'll be home soon.
Daddy'll be home soon.

01:13:51.468 --> 01:13:52.677
Shh, shh.

01:13:52.845 --> 01:13:55.179
Don't cry. Don't cry. Don't cry.

01:13:55.347 --> 01:13:57.306
Daddy'll be home soon.
Daddy'll be home soon.

01:14:02.020 --> 01:14:03.104
Oh!

01:14:05.774 --> 01:14:10.236
No, you cry. You wanna cry?
You cry if you want to.

01:14:10.404 --> 01:14:12.864
Go on, darling, cry!

01:14:13.031 --> 01:14:16.909
Hell, let's both make some noise!

01:14:17.077 --> 01:14:17.994
<i>Shall We Gather
at the River</i>

01:14:18.162 --> 01:14:21.205
<i>Yes, we will gather at the river</i>

01:14:21.373 --> 01:14:25.501
<i>The beautiful, beautiful river</i>

01:14:28.547 --> 01:14:31.966
<i>Yes, we will gather at the river dd</i>

01:14:41.977 --> 01:14:42.768
Git!

01:14:46.565 --> 01:14:50.401
Did you see that? I got the one
wearing my green apron!

01:14:50.569 --> 01:14:54.864
Run, you damn cowards.
Get your yellow butts outta here!

01:15:03.123 --> 01:15:04.457
Six...

01:15:07.878 --> 01:15:09.212
You'll be hot after this.

01:15:10.172 --> 01:15:12.840
One, two...

01:15:16.762 --> 01:15:18.763
By the time you return
with the woman and the baby,

01:15:18.931 --> 01:15:21.557
I will have your cartridges ready.

01:15:23.769 --> 01:15:25.478
Until then.

01:15:27.523 --> 01:15:31.317
Much obliged, but...
never had much use for one.

01:15:33.487 --> 01:15:36.531
I know I can't repay you
for what you've done, but...

01:15:36.698 --> 01:15:38.741
- No, please.
- No, you take it.

01:15:40.577 --> 01:15:43.579
- It's Marston's.
- In that case...

01:15:43.747 --> 01:15:46.624
Are you certain you won't
stay the night? You need the rest.

01:15:46.792 --> 01:15:47.667
No, ma'am.

01:15:47.834 --> 01:15:51.128
Klaus should be here
with the horses by now.

01:15:51.296 --> 01:15:53.923
I'd best be getting back.

01:16:03.100 --> 01:16:04.809
- Get back inside.
- What?

01:16:04.977 --> 01:16:06.394
Now!

01:16:09.523 --> 01:16:11.148
- Get here!
- No!

01:16:13.527 --> 01:16:15.403
Around the front. Oliver, with me.

01:16:29.084 --> 01:16:30.334
Check the lane.

01:16:40.053 --> 01:16:42.847
- What the hell's going on?
- He's out the front.

01:16:43.015 --> 01:16:44.181
Get out!

01:17:03.994 --> 01:17:05.786
We got him. Watch the windows.

01:17:09.041 --> 01:17:09.957
Upstairs.

01:17:11.293 --> 01:17:12.585
Get 'round the back.

01:18:07.099 --> 01:18:08.849
You, with clean water. Quick!

01:18:39.548 --> 01:18:40.631
Hmm.

01:18:49.224 --> 01:18:51.142
Oh, shit!

01:19:10.829 --> 01:19:14.498
He's done for.
The bloody place is falling apart.

01:19:23.467 --> 01:19:26.010
Quigley! Hey, get 'round here!

01:19:48.033 --> 01:19:49.533
Nobody could live through that.

01:20:14.768 --> 01:20:18.562
- Did you see where he went?
- It's pitch black there.

01:20:18.730 --> 01:20:22.817
- He couldn't have made it.
- Why not?

01:20:24.069 --> 01:20:27.404
- Go down and have a look.
- No, no. You go. I'll stay here.

01:20:29.282 --> 01:20:30.616
Excuse me.

01:20:37.999 --> 01:20:40.251
I give up! Quigley!

01:20:40.418 --> 01:20:42.169
Hey, don't shoot.

01:20:43.505 --> 01:20:47.091
There. See? Look. Nothing.

01:20:47.259 --> 01:20:49.969
You might wanna try your luck
with that belly gun.

01:20:50.136 --> 01:20:51.887
Then again, you might not.

01:20:54.808 --> 01:20:56.058
That's what I figured.

01:21:07.445 --> 01:21:08.529
Mama.

01:21:09.364 --> 01:21:10.781
Mama.

01:21:11.616 --> 01:21:12.992
Mama!

01:21:14.744 --> 01:21:16.620
Klaus, my...

01:21:29.467 --> 01:21:30.593
Why?

01:21:56.995 --> 01:21:58.454
Now, you take a good look.

01:22:01.625 --> 01:22:04.043
Even if you kill me,
Marston'll catch ya. He's coming for ya.

01:22:04.210 --> 01:22:06.462
I ain't gonna kill ya.

01:22:06.630 --> 01:22:09.673
'Cause you're gonna go tell Marston
I'm coming after him.

01:22:11.343 --> 01:22:12.551
Now git.

01:22:27.442 --> 01:22:29.735
Get here. Get here quick!

01:22:37.744 --> 01:22:40.829
- Don't bother to knock, will you?
- Quigley's coming.

01:22:40.997 --> 01:22:42.873
He's killed two for sure,
Paddy and Oliver.

01:22:43.041 --> 01:22:46.543
Quigley said to tell you he's coming for
you. He'll get us all. I know he will.

01:22:46.711 --> 01:22:49.254
Oh, shut up.

01:22:50.382 --> 01:22:53.300
One man, and he's beaten all of you.

01:22:56.930 --> 01:23:00.057
Brophy, you and Mitchell
ride with me as far as the gap.

01:23:00.225 --> 01:23:03.227
Dobkin, get every available man.
I'll find Ashley-Pitt.

01:23:04.688 --> 01:23:06.730
- Yes, sir.
- And get him out of here.

01:23:06.898 --> 01:23:08.941
He's bleeding all over the rug.

01:23:58.783 --> 01:23:59.825
Lady?

01:24:00.869 --> 01:24:01.827
You OK?

01:24:01.995 --> 01:24:03.579
No, no. It's all right.

01:24:06.666 --> 01:24:08.083
What happened?

01:24:12.255 --> 01:24:14.006
The Comanches came.

01:24:16.718 --> 01:24:19.303
But Little Bitty's just fine.

01:24:19.471 --> 01:24:22.514
I killed the Comanches, and he's just...

01:24:22.682 --> 01:24:25.601
He's just fine, honey.

01:24:32.275 --> 01:24:34.151
You're quite a woman, Cora.

01:24:42.327 --> 01:24:44.244
You get any sage hens?

01:24:48.833 --> 01:24:52.211
I got the next best thing.

01:24:56.007 --> 01:24:57.883
They didn't have a red one.

01:24:59.427 --> 01:25:01.011
Oh.

01:25:03.807 --> 01:25:09.269
- No matter. Is it pretty?
- Looks good on me.

01:25:16.694 --> 01:25:20.114
- I missed you.
- You did?

01:25:22.325 --> 01:25:23.909
Who'd you miss?

01:25:24.077 --> 01:25:28.497
- You.
- Me? Not that other fella?

01:25:28.665 --> 01:25:31.166
You.

01:25:34.462 --> 01:25:36.880
I don't want you to go.

01:25:38.007 --> 01:25:40.300
You sure look pretty
in that new blue dress.

01:25:40.468 --> 01:25:43.053
If you go after
Marston, he'll kill you.

01:25:43.221 --> 01:25:48.851
Kid, next time she talks like that,
pee all over the dress.

01:26:45.950 --> 01:26:48.952
You have every right
to your happiness, Cora.

01:29:12.597 --> 01:29:15.515
I don't suppose I can convince you.

01:29:15.683 --> 01:29:17.726
No, sir.

01:29:17.894 --> 01:29:21.438
I will see to it that
she gets out of here safely.

01:29:35.036 --> 01:29:36.370
Thank you.

01:29:56.182 --> 01:30:00.310
You know something, lady?
I ain't figured you out yet.

01:30:00.478 --> 01:30:05.774
Good. Crazy people are blessed
that way, don't you know?

01:30:08.361 --> 01:30:09.736
I'll never see you again, will I?

01:30:17.995 --> 01:30:19.496
Mmm.

01:30:23.376 --> 01:30:25.794
You sure look pretty
in the morning sun.

01:31:17.722 --> 01:31:19.389
Bye.

01:31:54.759 --> 01:31:56.176
Everything ready?

01:31:56.344 --> 01:31:58.470
There are two men at the front
and one at the back.

01:31:58.638 --> 01:32:00.722
Scotty's riding up
to patrol to the ridge.

01:32:00.890 --> 01:32:04.100
Mr. Marston, the men were wondering

01:32:04.268 --> 01:32:08.480
if the man who kills Quigley
will get the 200 pounds in gold.

01:32:08.648 --> 01:32:10.982
The reward you posted.

01:32:12.818 --> 01:32:14.569
Who asked you about it?

01:32:15.696 --> 01:32:17.405
Cavanagh.

01:32:17.573 --> 01:32:22.077
Have Cavanagh guard the front porch.

01:32:22.995 --> 01:32:25.288
Tell him to wear my coat and hat.

01:32:45.434 --> 01:32:47.143
Marston. He's around the back.

01:32:47.311 --> 01:32:48.812
What the hell is he doing?

01:32:49.855 --> 01:32:52.315
Emptying his revolver. He wants it
freshly loaded for the night.

01:32:54.151 --> 01:32:55.318
Do you think he's losing his cabbage?

01:33:20.177 --> 01:33:21.803
Maybe Scotty's got Quigley.

01:34:09.894 --> 01:34:12.604
"Anyone can leave safely before dawn
except Marston.

01:34:12.772 --> 01:34:17.233
- Most cordially, Matthew Quigley."
- He must think I'm stupid.

01:34:17.401 --> 01:34:21.321
This means he's gonna try and spring
something on us during the night.

01:34:21.489 --> 01:34:24.949
All right. Nobody sleeps.

01:34:26.077 --> 01:34:28.036
Give me that.

01:35:09.286 --> 01:35:11.246
Stay awake.

01:35:21.090 --> 01:35:22.090
Marston!

01:35:24.468 --> 01:35:26.636
Mr. Marston!

01:35:31.517 --> 01:35:34.144
- They're gone.
- What?

01:35:34.311 --> 01:35:37.981
- Three men ran off. Giniven, Kelly...
- Why the hell didn't you stop them?

01:35:44.155 --> 01:35:45.447
Where is he?

01:35:46.657 --> 01:35:49.576
He's gotta be way up there,
in the cutting.

01:35:53.164 --> 01:35:55.331
So much for Cavanagh's reward.

01:35:55.499 --> 01:36:01.171
That bastard's been sitting waiting
for two idiots to line up in his sights.

01:36:02.631 --> 01:36:04.090
All right.

01:36:04.258 --> 01:36:07.844
We'll do the last
thing Quigley expects.

01:36:40.085 --> 01:36:41.211
Come on.

01:37:01.565 --> 01:37:04.734
He's cleared out.
Let's get back to the station.

01:37:22.962 --> 01:37:24.587
Get up there.

01:37:47.903 --> 01:37:48.778
Ya!

01:38:13.304 --> 01:38:14.304
Ya!

01:38:38.370 --> 01:38:40.997
I'm hurt, Quigley.
I'll do you no harm.

01:38:41.165 --> 01:38:43.917
You throw that hogleg away. Easy.

01:38:56.430 --> 01:38:57.430
On your feet.

01:39:26.210 --> 01:39:27.543
Jesus!

01:39:37.805 --> 01:39:41.933
Brophy, get 'round to the side there.
Make it harder for him. I'll cover you.

01:39:42.101 --> 01:39:44.102
This rock's covering me fine.

01:39:46.397 --> 01:39:48.898
Move, you gutless bloody wonder.

01:40:17.302 --> 01:40:18.720
Close in on him.

01:40:49.501 --> 01:40:50.793
Brophy!

01:41:24.078 --> 01:41:28.164
I can bounce the next one
clean through ya. How brave are ya?

01:41:30.459 --> 01:41:32.251
I'm coming out.

01:41:35.464 --> 01:41:37.090
That ain't real brave, but it is smart.

01:41:52.356 --> 01:41:55.233
I got him! I got Quigley!

01:42:25.430 --> 01:42:28.599
Got a gift for you, Mr. Marston.
Quigley, alive.

01:42:28.767 --> 01:42:31.519
- Well, half alive.
- Good work, you two.

01:42:46.410 --> 01:42:47.618
Well, well, well.

01:42:48.912 --> 01:42:54.041
Mr. Quigley...
good of you to drop in again.

01:42:58.088 --> 01:43:01.007
What? Nothing clever to say?

01:43:05.929 --> 01:43:07.388
The great Quigley.

01:43:07.556 --> 01:43:10.892
This is what you were all afraid of.

01:43:12.936 --> 01:43:15.104
Bring him over here and stand him up.

01:43:25.324 --> 01:43:27.116
Stand up.

01:43:28.827 --> 01:43:30.703
Cut him loose.

01:43:41.006 --> 01:43:46.344
Now put his rifle...
on the ground in front of him.

01:43:56.939 --> 01:43:57.939
No.

01:44:00.651 --> 01:44:01.692
Throw it away.

01:44:06.657 --> 01:44:08.824
O'Flynn, go and get my second revolver.

01:44:10.994 --> 01:44:14.163
I know how much you'd like to have
your rifle with you, at this moment,

01:44:14.331 --> 01:44:17.750
but I think you'll find that
I've got a much better idea.

01:44:20.379 --> 01:44:24.257
Stick it in his belt. Go on!

01:44:31.974 --> 01:44:35.142
I seem to remember you're not too
familiar with Colonel Colt's revolver,

01:44:35.310 --> 01:44:38.437
so this will be your first lesson.

01:44:38.605 --> 01:44:43.859
Don't worry. Mr. Dobkin and Mr. O'Flynn
will ensure that it's a fair contest.

01:44:50.659 --> 01:44:53.828
I'll just back up a few paces.

01:44:57.291 --> 01:45:00.501
And to your left a bit. That's it.

01:45:00.669 --> 01:45:03.963
Now you're right in front
of my old pistol target.

01:45:08.385 --> 01:45:11.804
Some men are born in the wrong century.

01:45:14.725 --> 01:45:17.768
I think I was born
on the wrong continent.

01:45:21.940 --> 01:45:23.357
Oh, by the way, you're fired.

01:45:41.209 --> 01:45:43.336
This ain't Dodge City.

01:45:44.755 --> 01:45:46.589
And you ain't Bill Hickok.

01:46:34.763 --> 01:46:37.264
I said I never had much use for one.

01:46:37.432 --> 01:46:39.308
Never said I didn't know how to use it.

01:49:56.047 --> 01:49:58.173
Somewhat the worse for wear...

01:49:59.634 --> 01:50:01.719
This appears to be Quigley.

01:50:03.847 --> 01:50:06.056
I think you have a lot to explain, sir.

01:50:06.224 --> 01:50:09.226
Not that it will do you
any good. Sergeant.

01:50:11.354 --> 01:50:15.149
In pursuance of a warrant,
duly attested by a justice of the peace,

01:50:15.317 --> 01:50:20.362
you are hereby charged with numerous
and serious crimes, including murder...

01:50:20.530 --> 01:50:24.408
In short, this paperwork says...

01:50:25.785 --> 01:50:27.161
...that we can hang you.

01:50:28.997 --> 01:50:31.040
I ain't gonna swing on no gallows.

01:50:33.126 --> 01:50:34.543
Well.

01:50:34.711 --> 01:50:39.673
You can always be shot...
on the way to your trial.

01:50:39.841 --> 01:50:42.551
While trying to escape, of course.

01:50:44.054 --> 01:50:45.387
Or you can die right here,

01:50:45.555 --> 01:50:48.140
bearing arms against the army
of Her Majesty the Queen.

01:50:50.352 --> 01:50:52.019
The decision...

01:54:05.964 --> 01:54:07.047
All right, come on!

01:54:11.678 --> 01:54:15.389
- When's the next boat leaving?
- For Europe or the Americas?

01:54:16.975 --> 01:54:18.642
America.

01:54:21.396 --> 01:54:23.188
Let's see here.

01:54:23.356 --> 01:54:28.360
I've got one leaving
this afternoon for San Francisco.

01:54:30.280 --> 01:54:31.572
Mm-hmm.

01:54:32.073 --> 01:54:33.699
Your name, sir?

01:54:51.426 --> 01:54:52.551
Name?

01:54:55.013 --> 01:54:56.096
Roy.

01:54:58.725 --> 01:54:59.725
Roy Cobb.

01:55:09.277 --> 01:55:10.736
How many?

01:55:12.322 --> 01:55:13.447
Two.

01:55:21.831 --> 01:55:24.082
I got something I wanna say to you.

01:55:24.250 --> 01:55:27.628
I got a couple of things
I wanna say to you, too.

01:55:27.795 --> 01:55:32.507
Remember, once, you told me before you'd
make love to me I had to say two words?

01:55:32.675 --> 01:55:34.760
What's that?

01:55:35.678 --> 01:55:37.471
Matthew Quigley.
