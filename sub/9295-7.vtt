00:12.848 --> 00:14.832
President Hassan's security forces--

00:14.975 --> 00:16.172
they're still cracking down on the opposition

00:16.270 --> 00:18.116
and they're not showing any signs of letting up.

00:18.945 --> 00:20.345
The rumors have already started

00:20.441 --> 00:23.726
that the British are pulling out as signatories to the accord.

00:23.836 --> 00:25.187
Assemble the representatives.

00:25.296 --> 00:26.958
I want to appeal to them myself

00:27.081 --> 00:28.298
to stay the course.

00:28.788 --> 00:30.132
One of the suspects

00:30.255 --> 00:31.173
has family connections

00:31.282 --> 00:34.033
to a member of our delegation here at the UN.

00:34.132 --> 00:34.852
Who?

00:35.417 --> 00:36.498
Jamot.

00:37.874 --> 00:39.348
Are you arresting me?

00:39.543 --> 00:41.495
I demand to speak with President Hassan.

00:41.599 --> 00:43.881
President Hassan is the one who gave this order.

00:44.286 --> 00:45.613
What's wrong? You sound upset.

00:45.748 --> 00:47.303
I need to speak with you about your father.

00:47.406 --> 00:48.892
I have to go to the embassy right now.

00:49.024 --> 00:50.461
I'll meet you in private when I get back.

00:51.119 --> 00:52.764
This has the address and schematic

00:52.818 --> 00:53.780
of the evidence lockup.

00:53.912 --> 00:56.066
This keycard will get you access.

00:56.248 --> 00:57.388
How do we find the money?

00:57.520 --> 00:58.626
The evidence bins are numbered.

00:59.762 --> 01:01.695
Do exactly what I tell you to do,

01:01.812 --> 01:02.767
and you'll be in and out.

01:02.878 --> 01:03.984
No one will know you're there.

01:04.284 --> 01:05.337
The authorities know

01:05.433 --> 01:06.904
about the nuclear material.

01:07.059 --> 01:09.311
Putting Oleg in a clinic would lead them right to us.

01:10.083 --> 01:11.160
No doctors.

01:11.649 --> 01:14.545
The doctor said that Oleg could be treated.

01:14.835 --> 01:16.058
He showed me how.

01:16.186 --> 01:18.385
Who are you to question my judgment?

01:20.612 --> 01:22.544
Never disobey an order from your father.

01:23.700 --> 01:25.031
I'm sorry, my son.

01:27.804 --> 01:29.226
Tell me about this buyer.

01:29.450 --> 01:30.763
His name is Ernst Meier,

01:30.885 --> 01:32.009
German arms dealer.

01:32.161 --> 01:33.224
What's he looking to buy?

01:33.319 --> 01:34.799
Weapons-grade uranium.

01:35.425 --> 01:36.793
I'm going to have to meet this Meier,

01:36.916 --> 01:39.247
and I need a good-faith payment up front.

01:39.395 --> 01:40.506
I'm not going to tell you again.

01:40.600 --> 01:42.962
Leave me alone and let me get dressed.

01:44.022 --> 01:45.436
Damn it, come here

01:45.777 --> 01:47.140
or the deal's off.

01:50.128 --> 01:51.070
Meier?

01:51.248 --> 01:52.357
That's right.

01:53.227 --> 01:55.003
Where is the $5 million?

01:55.395 --> 01:57.001
The money is in your account.

02:01.021 --> 02:03.062
Drop the weapon. Now! Drop it!

02:03.322 --> 02:06.243
Meier. You really think you can roll me for $5 million?

02:06.409 --> 02:07.685
Let me talk to my man.

02:08.008 --> 02:09.084
Yes.

02:09.251 --> 02:10.295
Bring him back here.

02:10.656 --> 02:11.918
He wants to see you.

02:12.677 --> 02:13.598
Get up.

02:15.310 --> 02:19.461
fjdlafjlasjl

02:26.314 --> 02:27.373
Thank you so much.

02:29.420 --> 02:30.455
Well, that went well.

02:30.823 --> 02:32.156
Unanimous support for the treaty--

02:32.255 --> 02:33.866
well, nearly unanimous, anyway.

02:33.953 --> 02:34.938
I have the distinct impression

02:35.029 --> 02:36.655
that I am running out of goodwill.

02:36.770 --> 02:37.173
Maybe,

02:37.256 --> 02:38.808
but you bought yourself some breathing room.

02:39.147 --> 02:41.324
These people are already up past their bedtimes.

02:41.433 --> 02:42.607
I don't think we'll be hearing any more grousing

02:42.695 --> 02:44.379
until tomorrow morning at the earliest.

02:45.344 --> 02:47.228
Congratulations, Madam President.

02:47.364 --> 02:49.755
Thank you, I appreciated your support.

02:49.879 --> 02:50.391
Good.

02:50.495 --> 02:53.440
Now I hope you'll explain to me what's really going on.

02:53.686 --> 02:54.833
I thought I did.

02:54.938 --> 02:56.444
You invoked national security,

02:56.565 --> 02:58.227
which, with respect, is not an explanation.

02:58.351 --> 02:59.660
It's saying "Don't ask."

03:00.334 --> 03:01.168
Madam President,

03:01.252 --> 03:03.158
our countries have a unique relationship

03:03.504 --> 03:05.884
based on a trust developed over nearly a century now.

03:06.113 --> 03:07.421
Anything you say to me is

03:07.562 --> 03:09.177
in the strictest confidence.

03:11.084 --> 03:13.746
You may tell your prime minister and no one else

03:13.865 --> 03:15.644
that President Hassan's crackdown

03:15.757 --> 03:18.247
isn't just a response to the attempt on his life.

03:18.627 --> 03:21.528
There are unsecured nuclear materials in play.

03:22.048 --> 03:25.085
Apparently a faction inside his country was so disturbed

03:25.188 --> 03:26.190
by the prospect of disarmament,

03:26.283 --> 03:28.472
they decided to take matters into their own hands.

03:28.567 --> 03:29.597
Where are the materials?

03:29.700 --> 03:31.193
Here on our soil.

03:31.546 --> 03:34.035
CTU is running an undercover operation

03:34.119 --> 03:35.790
to retrieve them as we speak.

03:42.453 --> 03:43.334
Who is that?

03:43.579 --> 03:45.472
My guess is, it is my backup.

03:45.941 --> 03:47.768
No calls till we get to Vladimir.

03:47.910 --> 03:48.807
Does this look like a situation

03:48.917 --> 03:50.426
where you get to make demands?

03:51.248 --> 03:52.231
It's Meier.

03:52.431 --> 03:53.551
I lost my sight line on you.

03:53.615 --> 03:54.376
I'm leaving the building.

03:54.670 --> 03:55.585
I understand.

03:55.711 --> 03:56.701
Everything okay?

03:57.087 --> 03:58.968
The money's been transferred to Vladimir's account.

03:59.092 --> 03:59.790
We're going to his office.

03:59.813 --> 04:00.874
We should be there in a few minutes.

04:00.973 --> 04:02.341
I'll follow with a backup team.

04:02.921 --> 04:04.163
That might not be necessary.

04:04.299 --> 04:05.033
After what they just pulled,

04:05.096 --> 04:06.934
you're sure you're comfortable without backup?

04:07.318 --> 04:08.729
There are other considerations.

04:09.155 --> 04:10.289
You mean they have Renee.

04:10.548 --> 04:11.462
That's right.

04:12.771 --> 04:13.862
Okay, we'll stay back.

04:14.053 --> 04:15.037
I'll let you know.

04:16.289 --> 04:17.293
What was that?

04:17.644 --> 04:18.565
Let him know what?

04:18.696 --> 04:19.844
Shut up and drive.

04:22.014 --> 04:23.608
Okay, I got 'em on traffic cam.

04:24.712 --> 04:25.709
Is everything okay?

04:28.927 --> 04:30.734
Jack seems to be in control.

04:30.961 --> 04:32.531
Looks fine, all things considered.

04:32.691 --> 04:34.188
Driver looks a little worried.

04:34.466 --> 04:35.709
Who is this guy anyway?

04:35.836 --> 04:37.795
Should I pass him on to facial recognition?

04:39.558 --> 04:40.445
Dana?

04:40.672 --> 04:41.752
I've got to take this.

04:41.856 --> 04:44.136
Yeah, sure, no biggie.

04:44.264 --> 04:46.864
Just unsecured nuclear materials.

04:50.359 --> 04:51.136
Yes.

04:51.216 --> 04:53.533
We're there, outside the evidence building.

04:54.158 --> 04:55.766
You're in the side alley, right?

04:55.956 --> 04:56.887
No,

04:57.058 --> 04:58.759
we parked out front so everyone can see us.

04:59.453 --> 05:00.599
Come on, what do you think I am?

05:00.732 --> 05:02.882
Okay, look, I need to walk you through this step by step.

05:02.998 --> 05:04.100
I know, we're ready.

05:04.222 --> 05:05.725
Well, something just came up here and I need you to hang on

05:05.861 --> 05:06.666
for a few minutes.

05:06.805 --> 05:08.907
Here? We're kind of exposed, Jenny.

05:09.073 --> 05:10.982
You'll be fine if you just stay still.

05:11.150 --> 05:13.321
We have a 30-minute window before the next security pass.

05:13.432 --> 05:14.850
I will be with you the second I can.

05:15.359 --> 05:17.993
Arlo, Hastings wants us in his office for a field update.

05:18.108 --> 05:19.980
Can I ask you a hypothetical question?

05:22.967 --> 05:25.261
If it's about Dana, it's not hypothetical.

05:25.617 --> 05:27.630
If your fianc? Was cheating on you,

05:27.756 --> 05:28.832
would you want to know?

05:29.284 --> 05:30.911
Hypothetically, who'd be asking--

05:31.024 --> 05:32.952
some creepy stalker who's about to get fired?

05:33.630 --> 05:34.527
I'm serious.

05:34.692 --> 05:35.906
So am I. Just go upstairs.

05:35.990 --> 05:37.023
It's none of your business.

05:41.747 --> 05:43.588
Dana, Cole just called about Jack.

05:43.680 --> 05:44.502
He's almost to Laitanan.

05:44.617 --> 05:46.467
Hastings wants us in his office.

05:57.747 --> 05:58.963
Pass me back the keys.

06:07.589 --> 06:08.710
Slowly get out,

06:08.905 --> 06:10.188
put your hands on the roof.

06:16.511 --> 06:17.608
Let's go.

06:29.027 --> 06:30.708
So this is how you do business?

06:30.847 --> 06:32.254
I wire you the $5 million

06:32.354 --> 06:36.097
like we agreed, and then you try and take me out.

06:36.746 --> 06:38.379
I did not think you were for real.

06:38.942 --> 06:40.622
It was a misunderstanding,

06:40.784 --> 06:42.040
but it's past.

06:42.279 --> 06:43.351
We are here.

06:43.669 --> 06:44.508
As an act of good faith,

06:44.672 --> 06:46.713
Vladimir has already started calling his contacts,

06:46.855 --> 06:48.710
inquiring about the nuclear materials.

06:48.855 --> 06:50.041
I don't care what he's done.

06:50.148 --> 06:51.431
I want to talk to you.

06:51.563 --> 06:52.527
So talk.

07:02.570 --> 07:05.733
I want to talk to my partner alone now.

07:09.850 --> 07:11.369
Look, he's upset,

07:11.453 --> 07:12.641
understandably.

07:12.756 --> 07:13.579
It will be fine.

07:13.696 --> 07:14.434
Yeah?

07:20.577 --> 07:21.776
This is our chance.

07:21.925 --> 07:23.336
We should take him out now.

07:23.465 --> 07:25.878
No, we need him to do this deal.

07:26.120 --> 07:28.071
Don't risk everything for a whore.

07:29.031 --> 07:31.101
You ever talk about her like that again,

07:31.270 --> 07:32.483
I'll kill you.

07:32.999 --> 07:34.247
You understand?

07:35.130 --> 07:36.415
What the hell are you doing?

07:36.527 --> 07:38.203
I have authorization to pull you out.

07:38.863 --> 07:40.238
No, that's not possible.

07:40.341 --> 07:42.539
Renee, you've taken us this far, I'm going to finish it.

07:42.620 --> 07:44.997
Jack, you can't. He doesn't trust you, first of all.

07:45.095 --> 07:46.854
The only reason he's agreeing to continue this is me.

07:46.926 --> 07:48.339
I'm fine, really.

07:52.170 --> 07:52.941
You want to make calls,

07:53.041 --> 07:53.925
let's go.

07:54.787 --> 07:55.485
You don't have a say in this.

07:55.596 --> 07:57.355
I am pulling you out. No, look,

07:57.446 --> 07:58.650
it's not a big deal.

07:58.817 --> 08:00.439
I know what he did to you six years ago,

08:00.615 --> 08:01.796
and it is a big deal.

08:01.899 --> 08:03.366
Jack, if we stop this now,

08:03.451 --> 08:05.911
then everything that I have done is for nothing.

08:07.252 --> 08:08.287
We're running out of time.

08:08.338 --> 08:09.262
Let's go.

08:09.594 --> 08:11.356
We're almost there, it'll be worth it.

08:34.203 --> 08:35.340
Kevin, are you there?

08:35.955 --> 08:37.089
Yeah.

08:37.448 --> 08:38.682
I thought you forgot about us.

08:39.552 --> 08:40.669
I wish I could.

08:40.866 --> 08:41.739
Come on, don't be like that.

08:41.846 --> 08:42.708
Are we good to go?

08:56.447 --> 08:57.709
Yes, move now.

08:57.935 --> 08:58.671
Let's go.

09:00.014 --> 09:01.670
There's a security panel next to the door.

09:01.759 --> 09:02.672
Use the keycard I gave you.

09:02.769 --> 09:06.619
The code is 1668.

09:06.967 --> 09:08.709
1668.

09:09.983 --> 09:12.409
166...

09:22.996 --> 09:25.127
Keep moving, it will stop in a second.

09:25.231 --> 09:26.736
If you want the $120,000

09:26.821 --> 09:29.133
you will be out of there in less than 20 minutes.

09:30.001 --> 09:31.293
Okay, which door is it?

09:32.612 --> 09:33.795
It's the last one on the left.

09:33.885 --> 09:37.945
The code is 4660.

09:40.781 --> 09:43.480
Four...

09:52.598 --> 09:55.782
It's like Christmas... with chain link.

09:56.875 --> 09:58.203
Okay, how do we find the money?

09:59.311 --> 10:02.435
It's in section 3101.

10:02.600 --> 10:04.610
3101. It's down the aisle on your left.

10:04.708 --> 10:08.086
3101. The code is 2824.

10:13.791 --> 10:15.254
The last one on the left.

10:18.698 --> 10:20.408
3101-- do you see it?

10:21.325 --> 10:23.739
Yeah, right here.

10:29.431 --> 10:30.138
What the hell, man?

10:30.188 --> 10:31.404
Jen, what the hell is going on?

10:32.503 --> 10:33.624
What number is it?

10:33.823 --> 10:35.128
Is it 3101?

10:35.547 --> 10:37.753
3101-- this is 3110.

10:37.997 --> 10:38.553
Come on.

10:38.641 --> 10:39.639
What is wrong with you two?

10:39.747 --> 10:40.770
Hey, it's called a mistake, all right?

10:40.871 --> 10:41.570
Back off.

10:41.763 --> 10:43.039
So where is it?

10:43.466 --> 10:47.916
3101 is down the aisle on the left.

10:48.180 --> 10:51.954
Down here, down here. The code is 2824.

10:52.035 --> 10:54.880
2824, 2824, 2824.

11:01.476 --> 11:03.496
Bin number's 4301.

11:03.750 --> 11:05.303
4301.

11:05.524 --> 11:06.770
Oh, man, it's too many numbers.

11:06.867 --> 11:09.689
4301, 4301.

11:09.916 --> 11:10.984
Boom! Got it!

11:17.557 --> 11:18.948
That's beautiful, man.

11:19.390 --> 11:20.552
That's beautiful.

11:22.281 --> 11:23.741
Just shut up and get out of there.

11:23.903 --> 11:26.039
The next patrol is in less than 15 minutes.

11:26.255 --> 11:27.444
You've got the money.

11:27.689 --> 11:29.373
Close the doors and leave.

11:29.446 --> 11:30.709
15 minutes. We're leaving.

11:30.810 --> 11:31.869
Call me when you're clear.

11:32.363 --> 11:33.558
I sure will, Jenny.

11:36.343 --> 11:37.224
Let's go!

11:37.641 --> 11:38.701
Not yet.

11:40.472 --> 11:42.001
Check out some of this stuff.

11:42.218 --> 11:43.218
Hey, seriously, come on, man.

11:43.298 --> 11:44.382
Patrol's on its way.

11:45.412 --> 11:47.579
Yeah, 15 minutes.

12:15.002 --> 12:16.403
Are you sure, then?

12:16.526 --> 12:17.591
You haven't heard of anyone

12:17.665 --> 12:18.971
dealing in these materials?

12:19.983 --> 12:24.188
All right. Well, thank you for your time.

12:24.239 --> 12:25.535
I'm sorry to trouble you.

12:28.152 --> 12:29.038
Nothing.

12:29.148 --> 12:30.997
They did not appreciate being called so late.

12:31.188 --> 12:32.410
Renee, cut me some bread.

12:44.409 --> 12:45.384
Here.

12:50.870 --> 12:52.420
You might want to ease up on the drinking.

12:52.519 --> 12:54.174
You've got some calls to make.

12:54.298 --> 12:55.684
I drink what I want.

12:57.035 --> 12:58.491
Renee, where's the bread?

12:58.841 --> 12:59.917
Coming.

13:00.218 --> 13:01.184
Drink.

13:08.914 --> 13:09.988
What is this?

13:11.447 --> 13:12.678
It is too thin.

13:14.201 --> 13:15.416
It should be thick.

13:18.619 --> 13:20.264
Nice and thick.

13:21.192 --> 13:22.324
There we are.

13:26.748 --> 13:28.246
She's changed, you know?

13:31.041 --> 13:32.179
Six years ago,

13:32.677 --> 13:34.468
she thought she was too good for me.

13:34.932 --> 13:37.165
Now, she is much more friendly.

13:40.179 --> 13:43.184
Maybe I should thank you-- all that time you were together

13:43.267 --> 13:44.577
in Mexico City.

13:45.826 --> 13:46.977
Come on.

13:47.820 --> 13:49.691
I see how you look at her.

13:50.318 --> 13:51.343
Don't tell me you didn't.

13:51.441 --> 13:53.949
You want to keep talking, do it on the phone.

13:54.959 --> 13:55.943
Otherwise, the nuclear

13:56.034 --> 13:58.858
materials will be gone, and this deal will be dead.

14:05.230 --> 14:07.025
Fine, but I don't like you breathing down my neck.

14:07.089 --> 14:09.027
Lugo, get him out of here.

14:10.843 --> 14:12.396
And I'm running out of my vodka.

14:12.508 --> 14:13.556
Go get me some more.

14:23.574 --> 14:24.522
Sit down.

14:32.965 --> 14:33.864
I won't be long.

14:53.055 --> 14:54.439
My younger son.

14:56.384 --> 14:58.526
I wanted to bury him, Father Gregor.

14:59.625 --> 15:02.342
Of course, but that will take a little time.

15:02.728 --> 15:04.630
The cemetery workers need to prepare the grave...

15:04.732 --> 15:05.986
No. You will do it now

15:06.632 --> 15:07.862
out back.

15:08.451 --> 15:09.935
My men will dig his grave.

15:12.019 --> 15:13.375
Sergei Petrovich,

15:13.705 --> 15:14.607
this isn't right.

15:14.701 --> 15:16.103
Then make it right.

15:16.905 --> 15:18.019
Treat him like a soldier

15:18.073 --> 15:20.385
who died on the battlefield and must be buried there.

15:23.718 --> 15:25.055
Is that how he died?

15:25.318 --> 15:26.496
In battle?

15:28.166 --> 15:30.231
You just make it right.

15:30.986 --> 15:32.731
Say all the prayers.

15:33.076 --> 15:35.085
Where I end up, I don't care.

15:38.056 --> 15:40.329
But this boy is with the angels.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.806
My men will be with you soon.

16:01.974 --> 16:03.004
Leave us.

16:14.124 --> 16:15.163
Get up.

16:22.819 --> 16:24.211
Look at me, Josef.

16:25.221 --> 16:26.379
I want you to understand

16:26.512 --> 16:28.668
that everything I've done, I've done for you

16:28.976 --> 16:30.559
and for our family.

16:31.365 --> 16:33.045
You killed my brother.

16:33.532 --> 16:34.919
Because I loved him,

16:36.450 --> 16:38.850
because I couldn't bear to see him suffer,

16:39.143 --> 16:40.971
because there was no other way.

16:41.116 --> 16:43.182
There's always another way.

16:43.309 --> 16:45.957
Not when we are dealing with nuclear materials.

16:46.082 --> 16:48.155
We cannot risk the authorities finding out.

16:48.224 --> 16:49.097
You know that.

16:50.815 --> 16:52.573
You don't know why I'm doing this?

16:53.876 --> 16:55.413
Because when I die,

16:56.539 --> 16:57.541
I want to leave you

16:57.620 --> 17:00.062
and your family a worthy inheritance.

17:00.457 --> 17:02.758
Wealth, respect,

17:03.056 --> 17:04.204
consequence.

17:06.239 --> 17:07.885
Can you understand that?

17:11.289 --> 17:12.732
One day you will.

17:13.565 --> 17:15.878
As your son grows older, you will.

17:17.887 --> 17:19.464
And you will understand

17:20.025 --> 17:21.637
how much I love you.

17:22.582 --> 17:24.223
My only son.

17:32.311 --> 17:34.737
Father Gregor is here to bury Oleg.

17:35.567 --> 17:36.788
Will you help him?

17:38.922 --> 17:40.082
He's my brother.

17:41.596 --> 17:42.442
Thank you.

17:42.962 --> 17:44.391
Call when you are ready.

17:49.367 --> 17:50.367
What is it?

17:50.569 --> 17:51.777
Vladimir Laitanan.

17:51.922 --> 17:53.255
He says it's important.

18:01.821 --> 18:03.915
Vladimir, what do you want?

18:04.010 --> 18:05.378
Sergei Petrovich.

18:06.043 --> 18:09.034
I apologize for calling you out of the blue like this, sir.

18:09.460 --> 18:11.174
Uh, your family is well?

18:11.317 --> 18:12.624
I said, what do you want?

18:13.620 --> 18:15.449
I have a business proposition.

18:15.576 --> 18:17.995
Then call me in business time, not in the middle of the night.

18:18.163 --> 18:19.476
No, no, no, this can't wait.

18:20.408 --> 18:23.014
I hear there are materials for sale,

18:23.094 --> 18:25.835
expensive materials, dangerous ones.

18:25.965 --> 18:27.717
Talk straight. What materials?

18:28.955 --> 18:30.383
Nuclear rods.

18:32.391 --> 18:34.277
Highly enriched uranium.

18:35.335 --> 18:36.902
So, why are you calling me?

18:37.249 --> 18:38.601
If anyone has the organization

18:38.691 --> 18:40.416
to pull off such a deal, it's you.

18:40.544 --> 18:41.440
I'm flattered.

18:41.563 --> 18:44.432
I have a buyer here, a German.

18:44.553 --> 18:47.258
He's willing to pay a great deal of money for them.

18:47.430 --> 18:48.884
Double any offer you have.

18:48.941 --> 18:50.516
Then he is as stupid as you are.

18:51.063 --> 18:52.476
Are you out of your mind?

18:52.608 --> 18:54.524
Nobody deals in nuclear rods, nobody.

18:58.224 --> 18:59.010
I'm sorry.

18:59.079 --> 19:00.368
A misunderstanding.

19:00.460 --> 19:01.621
Don't call me again.

19:07.352 --> 19:09.361
He had no idea what I was talking about.

19:10.593 --> 19:12.237
All right, then we call the next person.

19:12.901 --> 19:14.082
You're not listening.

19:14.166 --> 19:16.186
He says nobody sells these things.

19:16.767 --> 19:17.569
Nobody.

19:17.640 --> 19:19.765
You're close to the biggest deal of your life, Vladimir.

19:19.812 --> 19:21.680
He's just jealous that he's not in on it.

19:25.318 --> 19:26.808
Come here. Come here.

19:29.907 --> 19:30.701
Look, later.

19:31.279 --> 19:32.393
Later.

19:32.987 --> 19:34.559
Once you've made more calls.

19:35.939 --> 19:37.063
Come on.

19:42.258 --> 19:44.512
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.

19:47.619 --> 19:48.674
We have a problem.

19:48.853 --> 19:51.172
Vladimir Laitanan knows about the fuel rods.

19:51.301 --> 19:52.455
What are you going to do?

20:00.285 --> 20:00.925
Da.

20:01.218 --> 20:02.134
fafadsfa

20:02.693 --> 20:06.394
fadfasdfa

20:07.105 --> 20:08.317
fadsfasdfa

20:08.851 --> 20:12.210
fasdfasdfasd

20:17.574 --> 20:18.327
Anton?

20:18.487 --> 20:22.001
fdsafasdf

20:22.297 --> 20:24.583
fsadfasdfasdf

20:58.235 --> 20:59.059
Yes?

20:59.282 --> 21:01.223
Mr. President, it's Allison Taylor.

21:01.320 --> 21:03.459
We were scheduled to resume our discussions.

21:03.706 --> 21:05.293
I'm late, I know. I apologize.

21:05.642 --> 21:06.738
The events of this evening...

21:06.815 --> 21:09.000
The events of this evening make it more important than ever

21:09.111 --> 21:11.656
that we complete our work on this treaty.

21:12.045 --> 21:14.789
Mr. President, I need to know your intentions.

21:15.730 --> 21:16.902
My intentions?

21:17.083 --> 21:19.088
The crackdown on your countrymen.

21:19.345 --> 21:20.006
I've been informed

21:20.096 --> 21:22.244
that you've even arrested one of your own delegation.

21:22.352 --> 21:23.692
That's an internal matter.

21:24.036 --> 21:25.721
No, sir, it is not.

21:26.061 --> 21:27.235
Less than an hour ago,

21:27.330 --> 21:29.320
I assured delegates from two dozen countries

21:29.423 --> 21:31.906
that you were still our best hope for peace.

21:32.130 --> 21:34.204
I personally guaranteed them you'd observe

28:02.897 --> 28:05.475
Tarin, are you all right?

28:05.475 --> 28:07.140
When did you get back from the embassy?

28:07.140 --> 28:08.039
Just now.

28:08.449 --> 28:09.332
May I come in?

28:10.747 --> 28:12.018
What is it?

28:15.371 --> 28:16.665
It's only me here.

28:18.067 --> 28:19.166
It's safe.

28:29.784 --> 28:30.812
What's wrong?

28:32.781 --> 28:35.126
You know your father has had many people arrested,

28:35.126 --> 28:36.794
including Jamot.

28:37.651 --> 28:39.319
Now he's having Jamot's wife

28:39.319 --> 28:41.573
and two children detained back home,

28:41.798 --> 28:43.919
so they can be used to force him to talk.

28:44.972 --> 28:45.996
No.

28:46.754 --> 28:48.224
There must be some mistake.

28:48.224 --> 28:49.821
He gave the order himself.

28:51.675 --> 28:53.653
I thought I'd convinced him not to,

28:53.653 --> 28:55.263
but he was lying to me,

28:55.263 --> 28:56.962
he went behind my back.

28:59.475 --> 29:01.997
Kayla, your father is a great man.

29:02.446 --> 29:06.153
I respect him more than anyone I have ever known.

29:07.082 --> 29:09.509
But Farhad's betrayal has changed him.

29:10.476 --> 29:11.770
What can we do?

29:12.182 --> 29:13.904
Open up, please.

29:18.291 --> 29:19.291
What are they doing here?

29:19.325 --> 29:20.759
I don't know.

29:20.792 --> 29:22.059
Open up.

29:22.092 --> 29:24.059
Tarin, stay here.

29:29.725 --> 29:31.725
Yes, Nabeel? Miss Kayla,

29:31.759 --> 29:33.191
we've been looking everywhere for Tarin.

29:33.225 --> 29:34.425
Have you seen him?

29:34.458 --> 29:35.892
No.

29:35.925 --> 29:38.358
Is there some problem?

29:40.325 --> 29:41.725
What do you think you're doing?

29:41.759 --> 29:42.959
We have orders, Miss Kayla.

29:42.992 --> 29:44.625
I said he wasn't here.

29:44.659 --> 29:46.659
I'm sorry, but I don't believe you.

29:46.692 --> 29:48.092
You can't just barge in here!

29:48.126 --> 29:51.859
I need to talk to my father!

29:51.892 --> 29:53.625
Nabeel.

29:55.191 --> 29:58.059
Why do you need armed guards to come looking for me?

29:58.092 --> 29:59.625
The president says you may be involved with his brother.

29:59.659 --> 30:00.859
Based on what?

30:00.892 --> 30:02.059
Nothing.

30:02.092 --> 30:03.425
Only that I would not allow

30:03.458 --> 30:04.959
an innocent family to be tortured.

30:04.992 --> 30:06.425
He's ordered me to detain you.

30:06.458 --> 30:07.592
I have no choice.

30:07.625 --> 30:09.126
You do have a choice, Nabeel.

30:09.158 --> 30:11.825
Tell my father he's made a mistake,

30:11.859 --> 30:13.625
that there's no one more loyal than Tarin.

30:13.659 --> 30:14.659
Nabeel, this is insane,

30:14.692 --> 30:15.859
and you know it.

30:15.892 --> 30:18.126
Don't make this worse, please.

30:18.158 --> 30:19.458
Don't you see? My hands are tied.

30:34.225 --> 30:35.458
Let me talk to my father.

30:35.492 --> 30:37.692
He's given orders not to be disturbed.

30:37.725 --> 30:39.692
Even by you.

30:42.458 --> 30:44.592
I'll talk to him!

30:44.625 --> 30:46.625
I'll get him to change his mind!

31:07.358 --> 31:08.525
No, I understand, Roman.

31:08.558 --> 31:10.525
We'll do business some other time, okay.

31:12.325 --> 31:14.126
That's it.

31:14.158 --> 31:15.325
Last one.

31:15.358 --> 31:17.026
He also knows nothing about nuclear rods.

31:17.059 --> 31:19.392
He also said it's suicide to deal in them.

31:19.425 --> 31:21.026
Meier has wasted our time.

31:21.059 --> 31:23.026
No, look, Meier's intel is good. So we need to think.

31:23.059 --> 31:24.558
Who else can we call? No one.

31:24.592 --> 31:26.558
I've called everyone who could possibly deal in these things.

31:26.592 --> 31:27.892
Then somebody that you've already talked to

31:27.925 --> 31:28.925
has to know something.

31:28.959 --> 31:30.258
Renee, it's-it's done.

31:30.291 --> 31:31.892
Look, maybe they don't want to admit it.

31:31.925 --> 31:33.592
Maybe they don't know how serious you are.

31:33.625 --> 31:35.258
You should call them back. I said no.

31:35.291 --> 31:36.892
Tell them that you have the buyer, tell them you have the money.

31:36.925 --> 31:38.191
Shut up!

31:38.225 --> 31:40.092
Just because I like your face doesn't mean

31:40.126 --> 31:41.425
I have to put up with your crap.

31:41.458 --> 31:42.659
We made $5 million.

31:42.692 --> 31:43.859
A good night's work.

31:43.892 --> 31:45.725
Why settle for five when we can have 50?

31:47.759 --> 31:49.492
When did you get so greedy?

31:49.525 --> 31:52.892
$5 million is plenty.

31:52.925 --> 31:55.092
Plus we have each other, that's not too bad, is it?

31:55.126 --> 31:57.759
Oh, it's not bad.

31:57.792 --> 31:59.759
But it could be better.

32:00.825 --> 32:01.992
Call them again.

32:02.026 --> 32:03.191
Do it for me.

32:03.225 --> 32:05.558
I said no.

32:05.592 --> 32:07.859
Come on, Vladimir, push them harder.

32:07.239 --> 32:09.663
Somebody knows something. What is your problem?

32:09.663 --> 32:11.309
Nobody knows. There's no one left to call.

32:11.309 --> 32:12.075
Now you go out there

32:12.075 --> 32:13.372
and you tell Meier to leave, okay.

32:13.372 --> 32:14.871
I'm not telling him anything!

32:14.905 --> 32:16.305
What?

32:16.338 --> 32:17.804
Not until you try again.

32:17.838 --> 32:18.971
Look, it's over!

32:19.005 --> 32:20.771
What is wrong with you?! I need this deal.

32:22.138 --> 32:23.905
That is why you're here? The deal?

32:23.938 --> 32:25.938
Why else? Do you think that I'm here for you?

32:33.372 --> 32:34.571
Get up.

32:41.771 --> 32:43.638
Renee.

32:43.671 --> 32:46.504
Stop! Stop!

32:46.537 --> 32:47.871
Stop!

32:49.571 --> 32:51.871
Oh, God.

32:51.905 --> 32:53.272
Oh, God.

32:54.671 --> 32:55.804
Oh, God.

32:58.238 --> 32:59.871
Oh, God!

33:19.205 --> 33:21.704
It's all right. It's all right.

33:21.738 --> 33:23.038
It's over.

33:30.638 --> 33:34.038
It's over. It's okay.

33:47.508 --> 33:49.058
Laitanan contacted everyone

33:49.058 --> 33:50.128
he thought might have information

33:50.128 --> 33:51.409
on the nuclear materials.

33:51.409 --> 33:52.576
No one responded.

33:52.609 --> 33:54.177
That's when he said he was finished.

33:54.209 --> 33:56.177
Renee kept pushing him,

33:56.209 --> 33:58.177
and it got ugly.

33:58.209 --> 34:00.077
Laitanan's dead.

34:00.110 --> 34:01.676
He attacked her.

34:01.710 --> 34:03.177
And so, what, you took him out?

34:03.209 --> 34:05.143
No, she did.

34:05.177 --> 34:06.143
She did?

34:06.177 --> 34:07.309
Half an hour earlier,

34:07.342 --> 34:08.676
she was having sex with the guy.

34:08.710 --> 34:10.143
How does that even happen, Jack?

34:10.177 --> 34:11.309
What, she lose it?

34:11.342 --> 34:12.842
She was defending herself.

34:12.876 --> 34:15.077
Look, we knew this guy was violent before we even went in.

34:15.110 --> 34:16.242
He's violent?

34:16.275 --> 34:17.842
He's dead on the floor. Yes, he is.

34:17.876 --> 34:19.077
And right, now,

34:19.110 --> 34:20.710
we still don't have the nuclear materials secured,

34:20.743 --> 34:21.943
so I suggest we move on.

34:21.976 --> 34:23.342
Move on?

34:23.376 --> 34:25.143
He was our only lead, Jack.

34:25.177 --> 34:26.609
Now, where do we move on to?

34:26.643 --> 34:28.842
We can start by working the phone calls that Laitanan made.

34:28.876 --> 34:30.143
There's also physical files here

34:30.177 --> 34:31.710
and a computer to go through.

34:31.743 --> 34:33.143
Yeah, fine. Cole,

34:33.177 --> 34:34.342
are you getting this?

34:34.376 --> 34:35.576
Yes, sir. We're en route

34:35.609 --> 34:37.275
from the staging area, five minutes out.

34:37.309 --> 34:39.208
We're gonna need forensics to rip this place apart.

34:39.242 --> 34:40.443
Yeah, I got Bennett with me.

34:40.476 --> 34:41.775
He can coordinate till the full team arrives.

34:41.810 --> 34:42.943
Just do what you can.

34:42.976 --> 34:44.043
And bring Laitanan's body

34:44.077 --> 34:45.177
back here for autopsy.

34:45.208 --> 34:46.876
I want to know what the hell happened.

34:46.909 --> 34:48.643
Any other good news?

34:48.676 --> 34:50.309
Jack?

34:50.342 --> 34:51.476
Cole?

34:51.509 --> 34:53.143
Dana?

34:53.177 --> 34:55.110
Excuse me?

34:55.143 --> 34:56.676
I said, anything else?

34:56.710 --> 34:59.143
No, sir.

35:00.209 --> 35:02.242
Okay, then.

35:02.276 --> 35:04.043
We'll see you when you get here. COLE: Yes, sir.

35:05.077 --> 35:07.077
Our entire operation just went south.

35:07.110 --> 35:10.509
You think you could show a little interest?

35:10.543 --> 35:12.043
Pull it together!

35:22.177 --> 35:24.643
You didn't have to do that.

35:24.676 --> 35:27.143
Do what?

35:27.177 --> 35:29.342
Cover for me with Hastings.

35:29.376 --> 35:32.543
All I did was tell him the truth.

35:32.576 --> 35:36.543
When they see Vladimir, they'll know what happened.

35:44.443 --> 35:46.443
What do you think happened?

35:48.443 --> 35:50.576
It's like you said.

35:50.609 --> 35:52.710
I couldn't handle it.

35:55.242 --> 35:57.010
God, I'm sorry.

35:57.043 --> 35:58.077
It's all right.

35:58.110 --> 35:59.943
No, it's not.

35:59.976 --> 36:01.276
I could have killed you.

36:03.943 --> 36:06.077
I've made such a mess of everything.

36:07.976 --> 36:10.743
I just thought that if... if I did this,

36:10.776 --> 36:12.776
I could make it all right.

36:12.810 --> 36:14.409
I could have my life back.

36:14.443 --> 36:16.276
Hey. Hey!

36:16.309 --> 36:19.810
You can have your life back any time you want.

36:19.843 --> 36:21.876
You just need to want it.

36:21.910 --> 36:23.876
How?

36:23.910 --> 36:26.576
I've tried, and I don't know how.

36:26.609 --> 36:28.509
I don't...

36:28.543 --> 36:32.242
I don't have anything, anyone.

36:32.276 --> 36:35.043
You've got me.

36:35.077 --> 36:38.209
Okay.

36:38.242 --> 36:40.643
Hey. Hey.

36:40.676 --> 36:44.110
Look at me. Look at me.

36:48.643 --> 36:50.110
Okay?

36:53.409 --> 36:55.576
I didn't want it to end like this.

36:55.609 --> 36:58.276
I know.

36:58.309 --> 37:01.509
Look, we're a lot farther ahead than we were three hours ago.

37:01.543 --> 37:03.476
Every call Laitanan made is a solid lead

37:03.509 --> 37:05.910
that we can follow up, and that's because of you.

37:05.943 --> 37:07.810
You did your part.

37:07.843 --> 37:09.976
Now let CTU do their job.

37:10.010 --> 37:12.843
Please?

37:12.876 --> 37:15.576
Let me take you home.

37:18.876 --> 37:20.876
Okay.

37:20.910 --> 37:22.876
Okay.

37:24.910 --> 37:26.843
Damn it, they really must have been moving.

37:26.876 --> 37:28.110
CTU's here already.

37:28.143 --> 37:29.843
Listen to me. This is really important.

37:29.876 --> 37:31.609
Vladimir attacked you, and you defended yourself.

37:31.643 --> 37:32.943
That's what happened.

37:32.976 --> 37:34.110
I don't know.

37:34.143 --> 37:35.376
I do, and if anybody else

37:35.409 --> 37:36.943
wants to ask you questions about that,

37:36.976 --> 37:39.010
I'll be right there with you to answer them.

37:39.043 --> 37:42.177
Okay.

37:42.209 --> 37:44.376
Let me go talk to them.

38:05.443 --> 38:06.843
They're Russian.

38:06.876 --> 38:09.077
Vladimir must have contacted whoever's got the rods.

38:09.110 --> 38:11.077
They just didn't want him to know.

38:14.409 --> 38:16.476
Hold on to this.

38:16.509 --> 38:18.309
What are you doing?

38:18.342 --> 38:19.943
I need to let them take me.

38:19.976 --> 38:22.010
No. We have to get out of here.

38:23.509 --> 38:24.710
Listen to me.

38:24.743 --> 38:26.843
You want everything you've done so far to matter?

38:26.876 --> 38:27.910
I need to do this.

38:27.943 --> 38:28.910
When CTU gets here, you tell them

38:28.943 --> 38:30.077
to start tracking me from the air.

38:30.110 --> 38:31.242
These people are gonna lead us

38:31.276 --> 38:32.409
to everything we're looking for.

38:32.443 --> 38:33.643
They will kill you.

38:33.676 --> 38:36.010
No. At worst, they're going to have to vet me,

38:36.043 --> 38:37.443
find out how much I know.

38:37.476 --> 38:38.943
It should buy us enough time.

38:43.043 --> 38:44.409
Hide in here.

38:45.609 --> 38:47.876
Take this.

38:47.910 --> 38:50.177
If this door opens again, you start shooting.

39:04.910 --> 39:06.643
Don't shoot!

39:06.676 --> 39:07.810
Please!

39:07.843 --> 39:09.110
I'm opening the door.

39:09.143 --> 39:10.110
I'm unarmed.

39:10.143 --> 39:11.876
See? Both my hands.

39:11.910 --> 39:13.676
See? No problem.

39:13.710 --> 39:14.843
I'm unarmed.

39:14.876 --> 39:16.043
Don't shoot.

39:16.077 --> 39:18.242
What happened here?

39:18.276 --> 39:20.609
What happened?!

39:20.643 --> 39:21.910
They tried to rip me off.

39:21.943 --> 39:24.342
But you and I-- we can do business. Wait! Wait!

39:24.342 --> 39:25.476
No! Don'

39:27.443 --> 39:30.276
If you kill me, you're gonna cost your boss a lot of money.

39:31.342 --> 39:33.342
Who else is with you here?

39:33.376 --> 39:35.843
No one. Everybody else is dead.

39:38.309 --> 39:40.443
All I want to do is business.

40:18.810 --> 40:20.810
Mikhail!

40:21.003 --> 40:21.833
Ã“Â²

40:22.321 --> 40:23.677
Ã“Â²

41:28.943 --> 41:30.943
Hansen, upload to CTU.

41:30.976 --> 41:33.743
Mr. Hastings,

41:33.776 --> 41:34.910
site is secured.

41:34.943 --> 41:36.110
Video's coming through.

41:36.143 --> 41:37.743
Three bodies. Are you getting this?

41:37.776 --> 41:39.077
Yes, we are.

41:39.110 --> 41:40.476
Any sign of Jack or Renee?

41:40.509 --> 41:41.643
No, sir.

41:41.676 --> 41:42.776
I'm here.

41:42.810 --> 41:46.476
Here.

41:46.509 --> 41:48.143
It's Renee, sir. She's alive.

41:48.177 --> 41:51.776
Renee, where's Jack?

41:52.810 --> 41:54.543
The Russians took him.

41:54.576 --> 41:56.576
The ones that have the nuclear materials.

41:56.609 --> 41:58.910
How? We've been monitoring the building.

41:58.943 --> 42:00.276
No vehicles left this area.

42:00.309 --> 42:01.743
I don't... I don't know.

42:01.776 --> 42:03.743
They just suddenly appeared, but...

42:03.776 --> 42:05.077
Wait. Jack let himself be taken.

42:05.110 --> 42:07.710
He said that you'd be monitoring him from the air.

42:08.743 --> 42:11.476
We haven't seen anything.

42:11.509 --> 42:13.976
Our drones have been overhead the whole time.

42:14.010 --> 42:15.309
They saw nothing.

42:15.342 --> 42:16.710
Where is he?

42:18.943 --> 42:20.609
Where is he?

42:20.643 --> 42:22.342
We don't know.

42:22.376 --> 42:24.409
We don't know.

42:42.443 --> 42:44.443
Step up.
