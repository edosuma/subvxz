00:18.756 --> 00:20.246
We are ready.

00:20.325 --> 00:23.157
Forgive our excitement
but we've been waiting months for this.

00:23.227 --> 00:24.216
I'm intrigued.

00:24.295 --> 00:26.127
You'll be astonished, I assure you.

00:26.598 --> 00:29.498
Right, what you are about to see here today

00:29.567 --> 00:32.128
demonstrates that by containing
the black powder,

00:32.204 --> 00:34.001
we can control the charge.

00:34.873 --> 00:38.002
Guy's miners would then be able
to place a small charge at the scene,

00:38.076 --> 00:42.740
let the powder do the hard work, and increase
production without endangering lives.

00:44.416 --> 00:46.883
Please dismount, my lord.
There maybe quite a bang.

00:46.951 --> 00:49.920
- Really?
- Your horse is highly strung.

00:49.988 --> 00:55.688
It won't be the only highly-strung creature
if I'm made to hang around for much longer.

01:32.699 --> 01:34.690
Well done, my friend.

01:43.376 --> 01:45.139
Well done, Gisborne!

01:45.211 --> 01:47.736
Get me 10 or 20 large, huge crates.

01:49.215 --> 01:51.649
If I'm to create more black powder,
there are conditions.

01:51.717 --> 01:53.652
- Really?
- One.

01:53.720 --> 01:55.984
I'm allowed to sell my discovery
to other concerns.

01:56.055 --> 01:59.024
- Naturally.
- Two. I get a bonus for me work.

01:59.092 --> 02:01.219
- Of course.
- And finally...

02:02.061 --> 02:04.358
this powder must never be used as a weapon.

02:10.402 --> 02:12.303
I think you and I have a future.

02:12.839 --> 02:14.101
Trust me.

02:17.745 --> 02:19.610
- No.
- Lambert!

02:21.348 --> 02:23.509
- I think not.
- Think about what you're doing.

02:24.617 --> 02:27.518
- I cannot trust you.
- My dear boy.

02:29.122 --> 02:32.149
- Let me go or there will be trouble.
- I adore trouble.

02:34.494 --> 02:35.757
Whoa!

02:36.730 --> 02:38.196
Get him!

02:39.800 --> 02:41.198
Alive!

02:43.570 --> 02:44.867
Lambert!

02:55.649 --> 02:58.243
- Don't go!
- Stop, we can help you!

02:58.320 --> 02:59.786
No, no.

03:46.134 --> 03:47.396
- Stand still.
- Back off.

03:48.236 --> 03:49.362
No point struggling.

03:51.006 --> 03:52.836
It was a mistake to run, Lambert.

03:52.906 --> 03:56.000
- You'll not renege on our deal.
- There can be no deal.

03:56.076 --> 03:57.840
You lied to me, Guy.

03:57.912 --> 03:59.346
You force me to do this. Search him.

04:00.782 --> 04:03.580
You promised me
you would not use it as a weapon.

04:03.651 --> 04:07.450
- Please!
- Where is the ledger, with the formula?

04:07.522 --> 04:10.286
That information belongs to both of us.
I commissioned you.

04:10.358 --> 04:12.451
And that is where your input ends.

04:12.527 --> 04:17.123
Black powder is not a toy, Guy. It is lethal.
And I will not let you abuse its power.

04:17.197 --> 04:19.291
- Where is it?
- Somewhere you'll never find it.

04:20.668 --> 04:23.365
Your friend seems to enjoy
the power he has over us, very clever.

04:23.439 --> 04:27.704
Congratulations, you just made yourself the
most important man in Nottingham, Lambert.

04:27.776 --> 04:30.210
So when we hurt you,
we'll do it very carefully.

04:34.351 --> 04:36.682
- He's done for.
- We're done for...

04:36.752 --> 04:38.309
if the Sheriff gets the ledger.

04:39.522 --> 04:41.922
Few of those,
you could take out a whole town.

04:41.991 --> 04:43.925
"Hello, villagers, can't pay your taxes?

04:43.993 --> 04:46.324
- "Boom, you're out!"
- It's not funny.

04:46.394 --> 04:48.625
- Punched me to the ground.
- What was that?

04:48.697 --> 04:50.289
Greek fire.

04:50.366 --> 04:53.699
When we were in the Holy Land,
we heard tales of boats being destroyed.

04:53.769 --> 04:55.929
- Sunken without a trace.
- Typical.

04:56.004 --> 04:59.805
Our alchemists have been experimenting
with it for years and its called Greek.

04:59.875 --> 05:01.706
Never Saracen, Greek.

05:01.777 --> 05:03.677
- It's amazing.
- Not it's not, it's evil.

05:03.746 --> 05:06.738
It doesn't require any courage
or strength or wit to use it.

05:06.816 --> 05:09.478
Right. Plan is...

05:09.552 --> 05:12.886
somebody needs to get arrested
and taken to the dungeons.

05:12.956 --> 05:16.756
I'm not being funny but isn't getting arrested
what we normally try and avoid?

05:16.827 --> 05:19.989
Well, that's the quickest way in.
Why, are you volunteering?

05:20.062 --> 05:22.121
No.

05:23.898 --> 05:25.026
What?

05:29.071 --> 05:31.767
What? Oi!

05:31.841 --> 05:33.172
I'm being serious.

05:35.412 --> 05:38.472
Prince John,
in the absence of good King Richard,

05:38.548 --> 05:41.676
has turned this country
into a state of terror.

05:42.485 --> 05:44.350
His followers are thugs.

05:44.420 --> 05:46.912
Our taxes are too high.

05:47.556 --> 05:49.525
People are starving.

05:51.661 --> 05:53.629
What does one have to do to get arrested?

05:57.367 --> 05:59.392
Arrest me!

06:05.041 --> 06:06.008
Thank you!

06:17.655 --> 06:20.487
Hello! Psst!

06:20.557 --> 06:22.252
I'm a friend of Robin Hood.

06:23.226 --> 06:25.251
And this...

06:25.328 --> 06:26.488
is a rescue.

06:33.069 --> 06:34.162
Gisborne.

06:38.742 --> 06:40.438
Take this runt to the Great Hall.

06:44.182 --> 06:48.084
Lambert, help me to help you.
I cannot hold the Sheriff much longer.

06:52.123 --> 06:55.251
Lambert should be
at the screaming stage right now,

06:55.326 --> 06:57.191
but all I hear is nothing.

06:57.261 --> 07:01.061
- I'm determined to reason with him, my lord.
- Oh, really?

07:01.132 --> 07:02.531
And is it working...

07:02.600 --> 07:03.999
reason?

07:04.969 --> 07:07.234
You going soft, Gisborne, hm?

07:07.772 --> 07:10.502
Because he's your friend. Is that it? Well!

07:10.575 --> 07:14.102
- Leave him with me. I'll reason with him.
- I can handle him.

07:14.178 --> 07:16.670
No, you've failed me. You're off the project.

07:16.748 --> 07:19.477
Now, what is this creature doing here?

07:19.550 --> 07:21.347
This is one of Robin Hood's inner circle.

07:21.419 --> 07:24.821
- This is his right-hand man.
- Oh, bravo!

07:24.890 --> 07:27.323
He can tell us all we need to know
about the outlaws.

07:27.391 --> 07:29.360
Like what, hm?

07:29.428 --> 07:31.725
That Robin Hood is against us?

07:31.796 --> 07:34.129
That he keeps moving his camp on, hm?

07:34.199 --> 07:37.690
- There 's nothing to know.
- All right, so hang him then, make an example.

07:37.768 --> 07:39.736
Brilliant!

07:39.804 --> 07:42.239
A clue - no.

07:44.042 --> 07:47.238
Hang him and you have an instant martyr.

07:47.311 --> 07:50.110
Suddenly, everybody loves Robin Hood.

07:50.181 --> 07:52.376
What would you suggest we do with him, then?

07:53.150 --> 07:55.619
I'll make a real example of this man.

08:00.926 --> 08:03.917
Does anyone fancy a wager?

08:03.996 --> 08:06.965
Yeah? Who thinks he'll get out on his own?

08:09.469 --> 08:12.164
Trust me, Allan. Much can do it.

08:12.237 --> 08:14.501
We talking about the same Much?

08:15.073 --> 08:16.540
I will not poison myself.

08:17.542 --> 08:19.067
You will have to kill me first.

08:20.046 --> 08:22.037
Poison yourself?

08:25.250 --> 08:27.218
This...

08:27.286 --> 08:29.049
is Burgundy wine.

08:29.121 --> 08:33.888
And this... is the very best venison, hmm?

08:33.993 --> 08:35.960
Mm, a feast.

08:37.729 --> 08:39.197
Although granted,

08:39.265 --> 08:42.359
they make taste like poison
to a peasant's palate.

08:47.473 --> 08:49.168
Hmm, which reminds me.

08:49.241 --> 08:50.675
Gisborne, your sword.

08:52.344 --> 08:54.905
We're going to take hearts and minds
to a new level.

09:00.887 --> 09:02.149
Stop him.

09:02.221 --> 09:03.847
Make him kneel.

09:18.504 --> 09:20.563
By the powers vested in me...

09:20.640 --> 09:22.437
blah-di-blah-di-blah...

09:22.509 --> 09:25.443
I dub you...

09:25.511 --> 09:27.308
Earl of Bonchurch.

09:27.380 --> 09:30.577
Hm? That's what you were promised, wasn't it?

09:30.650 --> 09:33.312
When you came home, hm? Stand!

09:36.923 --> 09:40.360
Lord Much!
Well? Do you feel honored?

09:41.728 --> 09:43.356
Have you really just made me an earl?

09:43.430 --> 09:45.556
Well, not quite.

09:45.631 --> 09:50.194
No. I will have a word with Prince John,
and he will make it official.

09:50.269 --> 09:54.070
So, you will have all the privileges
and luxuries of a lord.

09:54.140 --> 09:56.735
You will take your seat in the
lodge at Bonchurch.

09:56.810 --> 10:01.270
Oh, and I expect you
at the Council of Nobles tomorrow.

10:18.299 --> 10:20.698
You're an intelligent young man.

10:20.768 --> 10:22.497
What would you do if you were me? Hm?

10:23.938 --> 10:27.532
I have a little of your very exciting black powder
and I want some more.

10:28.777 --> 10:31.336
But you won't give me any more...

10:31.412 --> 10:36.816
- I'll not allow you to use this as a weapon.
- But, if I ask you nicely,

10:36.885 --> 10:40.684
will you give me your ledger
with the formula, please?

10:41.622 --> 10:44.853
Well, there 'll be no nicey nicey now.

10:46.261 --> 10:48.355
Have fun.

10:48.430 --> 10:51.399
Show him the instruments of torture.

10:51.466 --> 10:53.525
Guy!

10:56.370 --> 10:59.339
Don't take it so personally, Gisborne.

10:59.406 --> 11:02.035
Consider, if you will,
the effect on the peasants.

11:02.110 --> 11:04.135
"Oh, look, one of us has been made a noble.

11:04.212 --> 11:07.238
"If we work hard, keep our heads bowed,
good little boys and girls,

11:07.315 --> 11:09.078
"maybe we'll get rewarded too."

11:09.150 --> 11:13.143
You see, our point of view
is that of money and power.

11:13.221 --> 11:17.158
Give him money and power,
he sees the world from our point of view.

11:18.026 --> 11:20.893
Oh, and, um, just between you and me.

11:20.962 --> 11:23.931
I've a certain person in place
who'll keep him on track -

11:24.566 --> 11:27.296
loyal, trustworthy.

11:27.368 --> 11:29.530
If you'll excuse me, my lord.

11:36.911 --> 11:38.743
Guy!

11:38.814 --> 11:40.577
You are upset.

11:40.649 --> 11:42.981
I'm fine. I cannot discuss it.

11:43.052 --> 11:47.681
I had not imagined the man who wishes
to marry me would shut me out of his thoughts.

11:48.890 --> 11:51.224
Forgive me, Marian. I'm not myself.

11:52.229 --> 11:54.526
Has the Sheriff angered you?

11:54.597 --> 11:57.589
No, the Sheriff undermines me
whenever possible. That's not unusual.

11:58.434 --> 12:00.994
Is this about Lambert and finding the ledger?

12:01.069 --> 12:04.164
This black powder is costing you a dear friend.

12:06.242 --> 12:11.270
I am angry because the Greek fire was my
project and the Sheriff took it away from me.

12:12.982 --> 12:15.780
Suppose we were to take matters
into our own hands.

12:15.851 --> 12:21.118
Surely the Sheriff would not mind how you went
about it. He strikes me as an endgame man.

12:21.191 --> 12:24.057
- If you could find the ledger...
- What would you suggest?

12:25.661 --> 12:27.652
Show Lambert you are still his friend.

12:27.730 --> 12:30.063
Take him to a place of safety.

12:30.132 --> 12:33.226
- You always say people respond to loyalty.
- No.

12:33.703 --> 12:35.637
Lambert would never trust me now.

12:35.705 --> 12:39.800
I think he would if you proved
beyond all doubt that you could protect him.

12:39.875 --> 12:42.538
- How?
- Take him to Kirklees.

12:42.612 --> 12:47.605
Perhaps tomorrow, there is a Council of Nobles
so the Sheriff will be busy.

12:47.683 --> 12:49.674
Regain Lambert's trust.

12:50.519 --> 12:52.680
You and he are old friends.

12:52.755 --> 12:54.656
Build on that friendship.

12:55.525 --> 12:57.618
Very well.

12:57.694 --> 13:00.218
Lepers, Gisborne.

13:00.296 --> 13:02.492
Lepers.

13:09.039 --> 13:10.939
He should be here by now.

13:11.841 --> 13:13.968
John, head for the sewer entrance and join Will.

13:14.044 --> 13:17.740
Djaq, gather some horses
by the east gate and go and get...

13:20.951 --> 13:22.976
All bets are off.

13:24.988 --> 13:28.355
- Robin, what is going on?
- Let's follow.

13:37.200 --> 13:39.998
- Why isn't Much running away?
- Maybe he cannot.

13:40.070 --> 13:42.630
Whatever the Sheriff has planned,
it will include us.

13:43.541 --> 13:45.668
But Much is safe
as long as we are not seen.

13:45.742 --> 13:47.710
Lambert might've already given in.

13:47.777 --> 13:49.245
I know.

13:49.313 --> 13:51.213
I need to get into the castle.

13:51.282 --> 13:52.748
Well, I've got a lovely idea.

14:06.597 --> 14:07.792
My lord.

14:07.866 --> 14:09.663
Welcome!

14:09.735 --> 14:12.931
The wealth and bounties of Bonchurch
are yours.

14:18.976 --> 14:21.740
I'm not here for a confrontation, Lambert.
I'm here to help you.

14:24.882 --> 14:26.577
Get me out of here, Guy.

14:26.651 --> 14:29.246
- They'll break me.
- You reconsidered?

14:29.320 --> 14:31.015
No.

14:31.088 --> 14:32.852
I want to help people, not harm them.

14:32.924 --> 14:35.825
But we can help people.

14:35.894 --> 14:38.020
Don't you see?

14:38.095 --> 14:41.087
This is the perfect weapon of war
for our troops in the Holy Land.

14:42.066 --> 14:45.035
It would help to save lives.

14:45.102 --> 14:46.502
You're so naive.

14:47.439 --> 14:51.636
I will die in here and all because
I have not toed the line.

14:51.709 --> 14:53.700
Then so be it.

14:53.778 --> 14:59.046
I have a plan to get you to safety,
if you give me the ledger.

15:05.757 --> 15:09.659
You are surely a spy
and this is a trap... of sorts.

15:09.728 --> 15:11.663
I beg to differ, my lord.

15:11.731 --> 15:14.723
I'm just Eve, your servant here,
and I'll do my best to please you.

15:17.235 --> 15:21.535
This is a lovely place and it's warm here,
especially at night.

15:26.945 --> 15:28.845
Yes, we'll see.

15:32.218 --> 15:37.520
I mean, I must say it is very pleasant,
as, um... as traps go.

15:42.127 --> 15:44.152
Will there be anything else, my lord?

15:45.564 --> 15:46.759
Yes.

15:49.268 --> 15:51.896
How does the Council of Nobles work nowadays?

15:58.044 --> 16:00.240
Meat dip.

16:00.314 --> 16:02.338
Nice one, Allan.

16:35.615 --> 16:37.241
Do you remember me?

16:37.316 --> 16:40.548
I'm going to get you out of here.

16:40.621 --> 16:41.883
No, you're not.

16:41.955 --> 16:43.479
They've broken both my legs.

16:44.558 --> 16:45.684
A detail.

16:47.761 --> 16:49.661
All right. Shh, shh.

16:51.165 --> 16:52.530
We need to get you out some way.

16:54.168 --> 16:56.398
- You can't.
- I'm not giving you a choice.

16:56.470 --> 16:59.132
You are the only one
who knows how to make Greek fire.

16:59.206 --> 17:01.299
And that is the joke.

17:02.409 --> 17:05.435
There have been so many variations
in ingredients, amount...

17:06.480 --> 17:09.347
I can't remember everything,
so I record it all in my ledger.

17:09.415 --> 17:11.406
Where is it?

17:13.420 --> 17:14.786
And I should tell you?

17:14.856 --> 17:16.847
You're an outlaw.

17:16.924 --> 17:19.758
But it would be catastrophic
in the hands of the Sheriff.

17:19.827 --> 17:21.624
Now, how much did you make for him?

17:21.695 --> 17:26.155
There are three barrels of the mixture
and the Sheriff has confiscated them.

17:26.233 --> 17:28.202
In the castle?

17:28.269 --> 17:29.599
I don't know.

17:31.572 --> 17:34.769
The Sheriff will torture you again.

17:34.842 --> 17:37.209
- Yes.
- And you'll break.

17:37.978 --> 17:39.502
Everybody breaks,

17:39.580 --> 17:42.550
and then the Sheriff will have
the ledger and the Greek fire.

17:42.617 --> 17:45.518
Now, I can hide it for you in another place,

17:45.587 --> 17:48.316
and you can honestly tell the Sheriff
you do not know where it is,

17:48.388 --> 17:50.879
and I will gather my men
and I will come back and rescue you.

17:50.958 --> 17:54.656
And what's to stop you from using
the Greek fire for your own ends?

17:55.196 --> 17:56.993
Nothing.

17:57.065 --> 18:00.466
Other than I am Robin Hood,
and I offer you my word.

18:07.243 --> 18:08.231
Oh!

18:08.376 --> 18:09.434
Oi!

18:16.384 --> 18:20.878
When you wake up, you tell the Sheriff,
Lambert no longer knows where the ledger is.

18:20.955 --> 18:23.082
- Robin Hood knows.
- But I'm not asleep.

18:24.792 --> 18:26.726
You are now.

18:29.865 --> 18:31.832
Lady Marian.

18:32.901 --> 18:36.030
I have come to pay my respects
to the new Earl of Bonchurch.

18:41.509 --> 18:43.876
- Lady Marian.
- Lord Much.

18:44.513 --> 18:47.970
Perhaps you might call on us soon at Knighton
with our mutual friend.

18:49.117 --> 18:53.680
I do not think that that would be possible.
Robin hasn't come yet.

18:54.890 --> 18:57.882
Well, then I shall call again
when it is more convenient.

19:01.363 --> 19:03.523
This is for him.

19:11.941 --> 19:14.135
I think I will find it, um...

19:14.208 --> 19:16.073
useful,

19:16.144 --> 19:17.908
being on the Council of Nobles.

19:17.979 --> 19:20.915
I will have your best robes ready for tomorrow.

19:23.485 --> 19:28.081
There is something particular, which I think
will make your first evening at home...

19:28.757 --> 19:29.815
complete.

19:30.426 --> 19:32.395
Come upstairs.

19:40.769 --> 19:43.567
The ledger is in the fourth water butt.

19:43.639 --> 19:45.267
That's this one.

19:48.578 --> 19:49.772
Guards!

20:07.596 --> 20:10.361
I'm not being funny. It's soaking wet.

20:10.433 --> 20:12.594
- It'll be ruined.
- Let me see.

20:19.442 --> 20:23.242
No, it's still good. This is it. I knew it.

20:23.313 --> 20:24.542
We know Greek fire.

20:24.615 --> 20:27.811
We are keeping Lambert's ledger safe.

20:27.884 --> 20:30.751
Guards are coming back. Come on!

21:21.772 --> 21:25.367
- You sit back and relax, Much.
- I am trying to complete my mission, master.

21:25.444 --> 21:29.642
Yeah? Because I saw this girl...

21:29.714 --> 21:31.579
- Eve.
- Mm, Eve.

21:31.650 --> 21:33.844
You do know Eve will be working for the Sheriff?

21:33.918 --> 21:35.146
Well, I'm sure she is.

21:37.956 --> 21:40.390
What happened, Much, hm?

21:40.458 --> 21:43.393
I am made Lord Much,
Earl of Bonchurch, actually.

21:44.062 --> 21:45.426
This is from Marian.

21:50.235 --> 21:52.863
And I was thinking that I could be of help.

21:52.938 --> 21:56.374
There 's a Council of Nobles meeting tomorrow
and they have access to prisoners.

21:56.441 --> 21:58.908
No need. We found a way in.

21:58.976 --> 22:02.573
But we still need to find
the barrels of black powder

22:02.648 --> 22:06.139
and the Sheriff has made a big mistake
making you a noble.

22:06.218 --> 22:07.548
Yeah.

22:07.618 --> 22:11.554
Because now we have a noble...
on the inside.

22:20.265 --> 22:22.324
All right. I got your note.

22:23.001 --> 22:24.798
So!

22:24.870 --> 22:26.771
- Gisborne's going to help us.
- Yes.

22:26.839 --> 22:29.672
And what on earth did you do
to him to make him agree to that?

22:29.742 --> 22:31.573
Nothing! I played on his conscience.

22:31.644 --> 22:34.771
You see, I'd believe you,
if I thought he had one.

22:34.846 --> 22:37.212
So go on.

22:37.282 --> 22:39.080
- What did you promise him?
- Stop it.

22:39.152 --> 22:42.780
Lambert is his friend,
and Gisborne feels undermined by the Sheriff,

22:42.855 --> 22:44.617
and I took advantage of the situation.

22:44.689 --> 22:45.678
Clever you!

22:45.757 --> 22:48.920
Well, I cannot see how,
we can get Lambert out any other way.

22:50.362 --> 22:53.491
This is the best opportunity
we have at the perfect time.

22:53.566 --> 22:55.898
- Guy thinks...
- Guy thinks!

22:55.967 --> 22:57.697
So what is this plan?

22:57.770 --> 23:01.136
Guy will not attend
the Council of Nobles in the morning.

23:01.206 --> 23:04.233
He will use the Sheriff's absence
to secure Lambert's release,

23:04.310 --> 23:06.904
and then take him on to Kirklees
where it is safe.

23:06.979 --> 23:11.439
If you wait on the Great North Road, you can
intercept them and seize Lambert yourself.

23:11.516 --> 23:14.508
And for heaven's sake,
find that ledger and burn it.

23:14.586 --> 23:18.284
I already have the ledger,
and I'm not going to burn it.

23:18.357 --> 23:20.188
I'm keeping it safe for Lambert.

23:20.259 --> 23:22.727
At the risk of the Sheriff getting hold of it?

23:22.795 --> 23:25.389
And what then?
It is too dangerous.

23:25.464 --> 23:28.763
How is it our calling to judge
what should or shouldn't exist as knowledge?

23:28.835 --> 23:31.325
It is our calling to protect others.

23:31.405 --> 23:34.999
If it is glory you seek by keeping the ledger,
then God help you.

23:39.545 --> 23:41.343
What's the matter, hm?

23:41.415 --> 23:44.145
Marian getting you down?

23:44.218 --> 23:46.344
I'm tired, my lord.

23:46.954 --> 23:48.352
You're, um...

23:48.421 --> 23:51.982
You're probably wondering
where your loyalties lie.

23:52.059 --> 23:54.323
Well, let me tell you where they do lie.

23:54.861 --> 23:57.386
Your friend, Lambert.

23:58.432 --> 24:00.194
He has slighted your loyalty.

24:00.266 --> 24:05.932
You do know that he told Robin Hood
where the ledgers were?

24:06.005 --> 24:10.500
The information he kept from you,
he gave to your enemy.

24:13.880 --> 24:17.747
Now, what friend would act so callously

24:17.817 --> 24:22.551
when your every effort has been
to protect him, hm?

24:24.858 --> 24:26.985
Take heart.

24:27.059 --> 24:29.186
Look at the bigger picture, hm?

24:29.263 --> 24:31.789
Your black powder will open
so many doors for us, Gisborne.

24:31.866 --> 24:34.231
It is power beyond imagination.

24:35.869 --> 24:42.206
And take heed, the sorry state of affairs
has in no way affected my judgment of you.

24:42.276 --> 24:44.608
Trust.

24:44.678 --> 24:49.048
When all others around us falter,
that is, that they...

24:51.885 --> 24:55.616
We make a fine team,
my friend, a fine team.

24:58.026 --> 25:00.392
Let's build on it, shall we?

25:04.532 --> 25:06.693
So...

25:06.767 --> 25:09.862
I'll go and pay our friend a visit.

25:09.937 --> 25:14.271
Shall I teach him a thing or two about loyalty?

25:14.342 --> 25:16.037
Yes.

25:16.110 --> 25:17.941
It's play...

25:19.314 --> 25:21.078
or pay.

25:23.685 --> 25:24.777
Ah!

25:24.852 --> 25:28.288
Now, Robin Hood tells me
that you told him where the ledger is.

25:28.356 --> 25:30.256
Why did you tell him and didn't tell me?

25:30.325 --> 25:33.226
So that you would realize I could
tell you no more.

25:33.294 --> 25:35.819
Oh, to protect you!

25:35.897 --> 25:39.595
Aaaagh!

25:41.135 --> 25:43.899
You know, sometimes I think
he doesn't understand me at all.

25:59.722 --> 26:01.485
What are you doing here?

26:01.557 --> 26:04.081
I could not pursue our project, forgive me.

26:05.159 --> 26:07.093
Loyalty.

26:07.161 --> 26:09.152
Loyalties are sometimes divided.

26:10.231 --> 26:12.200
Lambert's dead.

26:19.408 --> 26:23.309
My lords, ladies, nobles.

26:23.379 --> 26:27.475
Let me introduce the latest addition
to your well-fed sirs,

26:27.549 --> 26:30.313
Lord Much, Earl of Bonchurch.

26:41.764 --> 26:44.927
You know, I have heard that
there was once a Roman emperor,

26:45.000 --> 26:46.991
who made his horse a senator.

26:49.973 --> 26:53.567
Can you imagine that, hm?
All the other senators smiling

26:53.642 --> 26:56.611
as their latest member drops dung on their feet.

26:57.479 --> 26:59.709
You're not going to that,
are you, Lord Much, eh?

27:03.420 --> 27:06.115
So, down to business, hm?

27:07.223 --> 27:10.248
Oh, boring, boring. Oh!

27:10.326 --> 27:14.763
Oh! I see the proposed new plough tax

27:14.831 --> 27:17.561
will be phased in
at the beginning of next month.

27:17.634 --> 27:19.659
Well, I suggest a...

27:19.736 --> 27:22.034
I don't know, increase three-fold. Lonsdale.

27:22.839 --> 27:24.170
But, wait, wait.

27:24.240 --> 27:27.437
Why don't we seek the wise counsel
of our newest member on the matter?

27:27.510 --> 27:28.670
What do you think?

27:35.017 --> 27:39.388
- The plough tax, my lord...
- Come along. Come along! Eh?

27:39.457 --> 27:41.822
Should it be "yea" or should it be "nay?"

27:42.460 --> 27:45.155
To an increase in the plough tax, I say "nay."

27:45.228 --> 27:47.196
Nay! I knew he would say nay!

27:47.263 --> 27:50.232
Eh? Neigh, horsey, horsey, horsey.

27:50.300 --> 27:52.598
Neigh! Neigh!

27:52.670 --> 27:54.001
I have to say that...

27:54.071 --> 27:56.869
- I say...
- What? You have to say what?

27:57.607 --> 28:00.907
Well, let this serve as a reminder
about what "nay" means.

28:02.012 --> 28:03.741
To me, dissent.

28:03.814 --> 28:07.580
Neigh means horses and horses have to be
ridden hard. They have to be whipped.

28:08.886 --> 28:11.411
Loughborough. Hm?

28:11.489 --> 28:13.514
Marian!

28:14.224 --> 28:16.090
Lady Marian!

28:18.128 --> 28:20.653
How's your father, hm? Is he still poorly?

28:21.565 --> 28:25.262
Well, you will remind him about
my position on "naying", won't you?

28:55.566 --> 28:57.034
He's dead.

28:58.702 --> 29:00.830
I'm so sorry.

29:21.192 --> 29:23.285
- I'm burning this.
- Will, no!

29:24.996 --> 29:28.624
- Steady.
- This is not science. This is murder.

29:28.700 --> 29:30.931
Think of this as progress.

29:31.003 --> 29:34.939
Other scientists could do
much better things with Greek fire.

29:35.007 --> 29:38.373
Yeah, you could blow up
the entire castle with that stuff.

29:38.443 --> 29:39.910
Lambert's dead.

29:41.246 --> 29:42.873
He died believing I'd protect his work.

29:43.449 --> 29:47.214
Then let me study this ledger,
create black powder.

29:47.286 --> 29:49.845
With this, we could be unstoppable.

29:49.921 --> 29:52.890
This is not about one man's wish. Robin!

29:57.997 --> 30:00.158
First, we need to destroy the Sheriff's powder.

30:00.232 --> 30:03.065
That is a weapon he must not wield.

30:03.135 --> 30:05.625
It's time to call on our noble on the inside.

30:05.704 --> 30:10.574
I couldn't save you from the plough tax,
but tonight no one shall go hungry.

30:15.247 --> 30:17.613
- Thank you for all this.
- My pleasure.

30:23.723 --> 30:25.487
Thank you!

30:31.363 --> 30:33.491
It is my mother. She thanks you.

30:33.566 --> 30:36.127
Tell her she can come here
and eat whenever she wants.

30:36.202 --> 30:39.934
I make sure she wants for nothing
but I've never seen her so happy.

30:40.007 --> 30:41.940
Everyone is happy here.

30:42.008 --> 30:44.942
And you've made that happen, my lord.

30:45.010 --> 30:47.378
Please, don't call me "my lord".

30:47.447 --> 30:49.381
We are friends now.

30:49.449 --> 30:53.680
And while I'm here, and while I have food,
then so should everyone.

30:53.753 --> 30:55.050
That is Robin Hood's way.

30:56.522 --> 30:58.184
Lady Marian?

31:03.263 --> 31:06.027
I should like to speak with you
in private, Lord Much.

31:06.099 --> 31:07.690
Of course.

31:16.476 --> 31:21.641
Look, we need you to tell the girl that the
ledger is in the third barrel of black powder.

31:21.714 --> 31:25.242
But that's not true.
Robin has the ledger. He told me himself.

31:25.318 --> 31:27.446
What is the problem?

31:27.521 --> 31:29.989
I will not lie to Eve.

31:30.057 --> 31:32.321
- I cannot.
- Why?

31:32.391 --> 31:35.259
Oh, of course, you are fooled by her.

31:35.328 --> 31:38.025
She has to be nice to you.
She is paid for it. Grow up.

31:38.099 --> 31:41.556
If she passes the wrong information
to the Sheriff, he will punish her.

31:41.635 --> 31:44.866
If she's working for the Sheriff,
then she deserves no less.

31:44.937 --> 31:47.669
A good man has already died over this.

31:52.045 --> 31:55.538
Just do as Robin says, and tell the girl.

32:17.572 --> 32:19.472
That is a sad song.

32:19.540 --> 32:21.371
I'm sorry, my lord. I'll sing...

32:21.442 --> 32:23.170
Tell me, why is it so sad?

32:24.645 --> 32:26.772
My father would sing that song.

32:27.949 --> 32:29.177
He died last year.

32:30.651 --> 32:33.483
That annoys you, talk of the past.

32:36.124 --> 32:37.786
I...

32:39.460 --> 32:42.395
I don't know how to be around you.

32:42.463 --> 32:43.760
You could have a bath.

32:51.507 --> 32:55.943
No! Wear a bath shirt
and pour yourself a bath.

33:10.358 --> 33:11.917
You have a terrible voice.

33:12.460 --> 33:15.089
Well, it has been said by many,

33:15.164 --> 33:19.760
most of them fools, and now by you, so...

33:19.835 --> 33:21.735
so it must be true.

33:21.804 --> 33:25.034
- It is terrible.
- Ha, flattery...

33:27.176 --> 33:28.542
again.

33:30.446 --> 33:31.742
And now I've upset you.

33:34.316 --> 33:39.015
When I was in the Holy Land,
I would find myself craving something.

33:39.087 --> 33:40.851
I thought...

33:40.924 --> 33:46.759
I thought it was hunger,
and it was hunger most of the time.

33:46.829 --> 33:48.296
But, now and then,

33:48.363 --> 33:53.824
when I would feel it,
it would not be in the stomach,

33:55.538 --> 33:58.005
but in the heart.

33:59.107 --> 34:00.734
Your song's bit sad too, isn't it?

34:02.644 --> 34:04.670
But does it need to be?

34:04.747 --> 34:09.684
I mean, you could stay here.
You could stay here with...

34:09.752 --> 34:10.980
with me.

34:13.589 --> 34:15.023
I belong with Robin.

34:18.194 --> 34:20.424
If I were Robin Hood,
I would never leave your side.

34:22.165 --> 34:24.996
I saw him... Robin.

34:25.068 --> 34:27.092
- He visited me here.
- Really?

34:29.772 --> 34:32.333
There 's something I should tell you.

34:34.844 --> 34:36.607
Robin...

34:38.781 --> 34:40.942
This is top-secret.

34:43.786 --> 34:46.380
Robin has found...

34:46.456 --> 34:47.684
Yes?

34:50.426 --> 34:52.188
Nothing.

34:53.463 --> 34:54.658
Thank you.

34:55.931 --> 34:57.024
Why?

34:57.101 --> 35:00.695
For not telling me
what Lady Marian asked you to tell me.

35:02.605 --> 35:04.266
I knew she was wrong about you.

35:08.679 --> 35:10.647
No, Much, just...

35:12.783 --> 35:13.943
She was right.

35:14.018 --> 35:16.679
Of course, I'm working for the Sheriff.

35:17.755 --> 35:18.983
Oh.

35:19.991 --> 35:24.949
But tell me whatever it is
you want him to hear.

35:30.167 --> 35:31.827
- Marian!
- Sir Guy.

35:33.505 --> 35:34.971
I'm sorry.

35:37.474 --> 35:40.807
- Where is your betrothal ring?
- I felt dishonest wearing it.

35:40.878 --> 35:43.368
I'm afraid we have misunderstood
each other lately.

35:43.446 --> 35:45.780
I assumed you would be true to your word.

35:45.850 --> 35:49.683
You perhaps thought I would not mind
if you let me down.

35:49.754 --> 35:51.550
I sincerely did not intend that.

35:51.622 --> 35:54.284
I don't care.
I thought you were a better man.

35:55.159 --> 35:58.288
Now I realize I must content myself
with disappointment.

35:59.397 --> 36:01.490
I had to make a choice.

36:01.566 --> 36:04.433
You know that I'm all that stands
between you and the Sheriff

36:04.502 --> 36:06.662
and I would not see you harmed.

36:06.737 --> 36:08.102
I have to protect you.

36:08.672 --> 36:10.300
Hm?

36:11.509 --> 36:12.874
Will you wear the ring again?

36:18.615 --> 36:19.947
Of course.

36:20.018 --> 36:23.977
But we will never find ourselves
in this situation again.

36:24.055 --> 36:26.216
Everything is back in its box.

36:38.269 --> 36:40.999
- My lord!
- Ah!

36:41.072 --> 36:47.443
The delightfully cruel
and gloriously deceiving Eve.

36:51.483 --> 36:53.644
Do you have news for me?

36:54.486 --> 36:56.477
Come. Sit.

36:58.490 --> 37:00.356
Delight me.

37:01.060 --> 37:03.426
Does Greek fire mean anything to you?

37:03.496 --> 37:05.656
Yes.

37:05.730 --> 37:08.597
Well, then, there is a ledger.

37:08.666 --> 37:10.031
Oh, pleasure.

37:10.101 --> 37:12.662
Oh, such pleasure.

37:12.738 --> 37:15.673
And it's hidden in one of the barrels.

37:16.709 --> 37:18.700
What is Greek fire?

37:19.511 --> 37:22.241
Oh, that really doesn't need to concern you,

37:22.313 --> 37:25.078
my sweet, sweet Eve.

37:27.119 --> 37:29.087
As ever...

37:30.189 --> 37:31.951
you are...

37:33.526 --> 37:35.517
an asset.

37:37.997 --> 37:40.296
In black powder barrels.

37:41.133 --> 37:43.067
Gisborne!

38:00.119 --> 38:02.883
Gisborne'll be leading Robin
to the black powder,

38:02.955 --> 38:05.481
but the Sheriff will work it out soon, I'm sure.

38:05.559 --> 38:07.924
- Do you regret what you have done?
- No.

38:09.595 --> 38:11.563
Well, take everything.

38:11.630 --> 38:13.564
- Anything of value.
- No, I can't possibly.

38:13.632 --> 38:17.467
- These are your possessions.
- You must. We're taking from the rich - me.

38:17.571 --> 38:20.505
And giving to the poor... which is you.

38:21.240 --> 38:23.333
You are a good man.

38:24.143 --> 38:27.443
You are the bravest,
loveliest girl I have ever met.

38:29.649 --> 38:31.378
Really?

38:32.452 --> 38:34.215
Really.

38:35.622 --> 38:37.487
Will I see you again?

38:39.260 --> 38:44.253
When there is justice again,
I will come and find you.

38:54.274 --> 38:55.640
Perhaps before.

39:01.548 --> 39:04.177
Robin will thank you from his heart
for what you have done.

39:04.885 --> 39:06.944
I did not do this for Robin Hood.

39:08.089 --> 39:10.056
I did it for you.

39:41.290 --> 39:42.654
It's a cave.

39:42.723 --> 39:45.454
And thanks to our friend,
the Earl of Bonchurch,

39:45.526 --> 39:48.017
Gisborne led us straight to it.

39:48.095 --> 39:50.256
- So what do we do now?
- We wait.

40:04.545 --> 40:06.309
There 's nothing here.

40:07.382 --> 40:08.712
Move!

40:10.985 --> 40:12.885
Go, go.

40:20.762 --> 40:23.060
Right, let's get to it. Come on.

40:28.102 --> 40:31.038
Just this can destroy men and mountains.

40:32.875 --> 40:34.866
It is inconceivable.

40:37.079 --> 40:38.444
Hood got there first.

40:39.281 --> 40:41.272
The ledger' s gone.

40:42.817 --> 40:46.482
Didn't you tell me that you'd hidden
the barrels of black powder?

40:46.555 --> 40:48.887
I did. Yes, I did.

40:49.491 --> 40:52.016
- Who else did you tell?
- No one.

40:52.728 --> 40:54.958
So, how did he find it before you?

40:58.500 --> 41:00.867
- Were you followed, Gisborne?
- No.

41:02.104 --> 41:03.800
You fool!

41:03.873 --> 41:05.271
We've been set up!

41:05.340 --> 41:08.332
Dispatch every man you can to the caves!

41:08.410 --> 41:11.539
Bring me Eve and fetch me my horse!

41:16.918 --> 41:18.181
Show time.

41:36.506 --> 41:38.474
Gisborne!

41:39.375 --> 41:41.343
What are you waiting for? Get him!

41:44.047 --> 41:46.539
You have five seconds left in this world.

41:46.616 --> 41:48.982
This is for you, Lambert.

41:49.052 --> 41:51.248
Four! T hree!

41:52.021 --> 41:53.921
Two!

41:53.990 --> 41:55.548
One!

41:57.193 --> 42:02.187
Run!

42:32.228 --> 42:34.287
Life is a cruel mistress, Gisborne.

42:37.769 --> 42:38.962
Clean up your mess.

42:44.608 --> 42:47.735
Hey, if I burn it, that's not you, is it?

42:47.810 --> 42:51.179
No, I mean, technically, you kept your word.

42:54.818 --> 42:57.013
This is not about one man's wish.

43:03.094 --> 43:05.254
It's good to have you back, Much.

43:06.163 --> 43:08.154
It's good to have you back, my lord Much.

43:09.032 --> 43:10.465
That is gonna get really annoying.

43:10.534 --> 43:12.661
That's gonna get really annoying, my lord.

43:14.038 --> 43:18.407
It is really annoying, but I'm sorry...

43:18.476 --> 43:20.568
I like it.

43:20.644 --> 43:22.942
Well, seeing as though you like lording it up...

43:23.847 --> 43:26.112
To Lord Much!

43:26.684 --> 43:28.845
To Lord Much!

43:39.998 --> 43:44.196
- All right, all right.
- All hail Lord Much! All hail Lord Much!

43:44.269 --> 43:46.203
Let's burn him!
