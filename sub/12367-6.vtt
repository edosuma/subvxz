WEBVTT

00:02.293 --> 00:04.086
- PREVIOUSLY ON
<i>HOT IN CLEVELAND...</i>

00:04.170 --> 00:05.922
- BUT THIS IS
MY FIRST TRIP TO L.A.,

00:06.005 --> 00:08.550
AND THIS IS ROBERT REDFORD'S
FAVORITE RESTAURANT.

00:08.633 --> 00:10.051
- PLEASE!

00:10.135 --> 00:12.303
YOU SERIOUSLY EXPECT ME TO
BELIEVE YOU HAVE AN EVIL TWIN?

00:12.387 --> 00:14.764
- A DIM FIGURE
HOVERS ABOVE YOU.

00:14.848 --> 00:17.559
YOU WAKE UP HORRIFIED
AND REALIZE--

00:17.642 --> 00:19.519
[screams]

00:19.602 --> 00:20.895
- I HAVE TO GO.

00:20.979 --> 00:22.605
MAYBE WE CAN TALK
SOME MORE LATER?

00:22.689 --> 00:23.481
- YOU CAN COUNT ON IT.

00:23.565 --> 00:25.775
- OH, ELKA,
I THINK I BLEW THE SALE!

00:25.859 --> 00:27.068
- WHO CARES?

00:27.152 --> 00:29.654
I FOUND OUT
WHERE ROBERT REDFORD IS.

00:29.738 --> 00:30.947
- HIDE ME.

00:31.030 --> 00:32.656
I THINK I KILLED
SUSAN LUCCI.

00:35.034 --> 00:36.661
- I'M SCARED.
WE SHOULDN'T BE DOING THIS.

00:36.745 --> 00:39.831
- STOP WHINING, THERE'S NOTHING
TO BE AFRAID OF.

00:39.914 --> 00:42.459
- [screams]
- HEY, DEAD GUY.

00:42.542 --> 00:45.420
IS THIS THE ROBERT REDFORD
MOVIE?

00:45.503 --> 00:48.465
- I WISH, LADY.
TRY STAGE 19.

00:48.548 --> 00:51.009
- OH, EXCUSE US,
SO SORRY,

00:51.092 --> 00:52.802
BUT I LOVE
THESE CRIME SHOW DRAMAS.

00:52.886 --> 00:55.472
HEY,
CHECK OUT MY DAVID CARUSO.

00:55.555 --> 00:59.893
IT LOOKS LIKE THESE CRASHERS--
HAVE WRECKED THE SCENE.

01:01.686 --> 01:02.812
OH, WAIT, WAIT. I GOT ANOTHER
ONE, I GOT ANOTHER ONE.

01:02.896 --> 01:06.858
LET ME SEE--
IT LOOKS LIKE THIS SET--

01:06.941 --> 01:08.151
HAS MET ITS MATCH.

01:08.234 --> 01:10.653
[squeals]

01:10.737 --> 01:12.655
- WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

01:12.739 --> 01:13.948
- IT'S THE WHO.

01:14.032 --> 01:16.993
IT'S THE THEME SONG
TO <i> C.S.I. MIAMI.</i>

01:17.076 --> 01:18.828
- SORRY ABOUT MY FRIEND.

01:18.912 --> 01:22.874
SHE'S...
LOST HER MIND.

01:34.511 --> 01:37.889
{\an8}- MORNING, MS. LUCCI.
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

01:37.972 --> 01:40.350
{\an8}- OH, MUCH BETTER,
THANK YOU.

01:40.433 --> 01:42.310
{\an8}- OH, THE NEWSPAPERS
ARE FILLED WITH STORIES

01:42.393 --> 01:46.648
{\an8}ABOUT THAT CRAZY VICTORIA CHASE
ATTACKING YOU.

01:46.731 --> 01:52.070
{\an8}AND THE TABLOIDS
ARE CLAIMING YOU'RE DEAD.

01:52.153 --> 01:54.656
{\an8}- WELL, IF I AM,
I'M IN HEAVEN.

01:54.739 --> 01:57.742
{\an8}THEY USED THAT HIDEOUS OLD PHOTO
OF VICTORIA'S THIGHS

01:57.826 --> 02:00.203
{\an8}IN A BATHING SUIT.

02:00.286 --> 02:01.871
{\an8}- COTTAGE CHEESE?

02:01.955 --> 02:04.874
{\an8}- LARGE CURD.

02:04.958 --> 02:09.670
{\an8}OH, THANK YOU, NO.
I'M TOO HAPPY TO EAT.

02:09.753 --> 02:11.756
{\an8}- OH, MS. CHASE HAS BEEN
WAITING OUTSIDE ALL MORNING

02:11.840 --> 02:13.258
{\an8}TO SEE YOU.

02:13.341 --> 02:15.218
{\an8}SHE'S VERY UPSET
ABOUT THE ACCIDENT.

02:15.301 --> 02:16.886
{\an8}- YOU DIDN'T TELL HER
I WAS ALL RIGHT, DID YOU?

02:16.970 --> 02:18.388
{\an8}- OH, NO, NO!

02:18.471 --> 02:20.557
{\an8}WE TOLD HER THE SAME THING
WE TOLD THE PRESS:

02:20.640 --> 02:22.392
{\an8}"WE'RE NOT RELEASING
ANY INFORMATION

02:22.475 --> 02:24.602
{\an8}ABOUT MS. LUCCI'S CONDITION
AT THIS TIME."

02:24.686 --> 02:29.941
{\an8}- GOOD. ALL RIGHT, THEN.
PLEASE, SEND HER IN.

02:30.024 --> 02:32.193
{\an8}BUT FIRST, JUST FOR FUN...

02:32.277 --> 02:36.865
{\an8}LET'S PRETEND
I'M IN A COMA.

02:36.948 --> 02:38.741
{\an8}- A COMA?

02:38.825 --> 02:40.994
{\an8}- YES, VICTORIA AND I JUST ADORE
PLAYING LITTLE TRICKS

02:41.077 --> 02:42.412
{\an8}ON EACH OTHER.

02:42.495 --> 02:45.748
{\an8}I SENT HER BIRTH CERTIFICATE
TO WIKILEAKS--

02:45.832 --> 02:49.294
{\an8}AND SHE HECKLED MY SPEECH
DURING THE TOURETTE'S BENEFIT--

02:53.089 --> 02:55.592
{\an8}LUCKILY,
NOBODY NOTICED.

02:57.343 --> 02:58.553
{\an8}TRUST ME,
SHE'LL LOVE IT.

02:58.636 --> 03:02.223
{\an8}- THIS IS SO EXCITING!

03:02.307 --> 03:05.268
{\an8}NO ONE DOES A COMA
BETTER THAN YOU!

03:05.351 --> 03:07.103
{\an8}- YOU'RE SWEET.

03:12.400 --> 03:14.527
{\an8}- THIS IS HORRIBLE.
THEY DON'T MENTION

03:14.611 --> 03:17.280
{\an8}MY NEW BOYFRIEND
MICHAEL KNIGHT AT ALL.

03:17.363 --> 03:20.742
{\an8}JUST "FELLOW CAST MEMBERS
ARE PRAYING FOR A MIRACLE."

03:20.825 --> 03:23.828
{\an8}- CAN WE PLEASE FOCUS
ON THE REAL TRAGEDY HERE?

03:23.912 --> 03:27.540
{\an8}THIS PATTERN ON MY THIGHS
IS NOT CELLULITE!

03:27.624 --> 03:31.461
{\an8}CLEARLY I'D JUST GOTTEN UP
FROM A WICKER CHAIR.

03:31.544 --> 03:33.630
{\an8}- SHOULDN'T YOU BE A LITTLE MORE
CONCERNED ABOUT SUSAN?

03:33.713 --> 03:35.173
{\an8}- OH, SHE'S JUST FAKING
FOR ATTENTION.

03:35.256 --> 03:36.633
{\an8}I MEAN,
IF SHE WERE REALLY HURT,

03:36.716 --> 03:39.469
THERE'D BE A MILLION CAMERAS
OUTSIDE THE HOSPITAL--

03:39.552 --> 03:42.764
WHICH I DRESSED FOR.

03:42.847 --> 03:45.308
- MY NEW BOYFRIEND
MICHAEL KNIGHT,

03:45.391 --> 03:48.811
WAS SO GRIEF-STRICKEN
LAST NIGHT ABOUT SUSAN,

03:48.895 --> 03:52.273
HE ASKED ME TO LEAVE
RIGHT AFTER WE HAD SEX.

03:52.357 --> 03:53.983
HE DIDN'T WANT ME
TO SEE HIM CRY.

03:54.067 --> 03:57.070
SO SENSITIVE!

03:57.153 --> 03:59.948
AND HE'S MUCH BETTER IN BED
THAN HIS BROTHER WAS.

04:00.031 --> 04:01.991
ALTHOUGH WHEN THEY SAY
"IDENTICAL TWINS,"

04:02.075 --> 04:04.535
TRUST ME,
THEY'RE NOT KIDDING.

04:05.745 --> 04:06.829
- MS. CHASE?

04:06.913 --> 04:08.456
- YES, NURSE,
IS THERE ANY NEWS?

04:08.539 --> 04:11.626
OR ANY NEWS CREWS?

04:11.709 --> 04:14.003
- I'M AFRAID MS. LUCCI'S
STILL IN A COMA.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.672
- A COMA?

04:15.755 --> 04:17.089
- YAY!

04:18.548 --> 04:20.343
OH, NO, NOT "YAY!"

04:20.426 --> 04:22.845
ABOUT SUSAN,
OBVIOUSLY THAT'S TRAGIC.

04:22.929 --> 04:25.473
MY NEW BOYFRIEND
MICHAEL KNIGHT JUST TEXTED

04:25.556 --> 04:27.058
THAT HE WANTS TO TAKE ME
TO DINNER IN MALIBU

04:27.141 --> 04:30.478
IN HIS BRAND NEW FERRARI!

04:30.561 --> 04:32.146
WHICH OF COURSE
DOESN'T MAKE THIS MOMENT

04:32.230 --> 04:35.024
ANY LESS POIGNANT.

04:35.108 --> 04:36.526
- A COMA?
REALLY?

04:36.609 --> 04:42.240
- OH, MY GOD!
WE'RE HAVING SUSHI AT NOBU!

04:42.323 --> 04:44.283
- COULD I POSSIBLY SEE HER?

04:44.367 --> 04:45.785
- OKAY,
BUT JUST FOR A MOMENT.

04:45.868 --> 04:47.537
- RIGHT.

04:50.498 --> 04:53.835
- FYI, YOUR NEW BOYFRIEND
MICHAEL KNIGHT

04:53.918 --> 04:56.295
SLEPT WITH MY BEST FRIEND,
MADE HER ALL THESE PROMISES,

04:56.379 --> 04:57.505
AND NEVER CALLED.

04:57.588 --> 04:59.841
- WHAT?
OH, NO, WAIT!

04:59.924 --> 05:01.676
IS SHE SURE IT WAS MICHAEL?

05:01.759 --> 05:02.969
BECAUSE HIS
TWIN BROTHER ALEX

05:03.052 --> 05:06.055
PULLED EXACTLY THE SAME TRICK
ON ME ONCE.

05:06.139 --> 05:11.728
- HIS TWIN BROTHER ALEX?
SERIOUSLY?

05:11.811 --> 05:14.063
OH, YOU DON'T WATCH
THE SHOW, DO YOU?

05:14.147 --> 05:17.275
- OH, NOT EVERY DAY.
WHY?

05:17.358 --> 05:21.279
- MICHAEL'S CHARACTER
HAD AN EVIL TWIN BROTHER ALEX

05:21.362 --> 05:25.575
WHO IMPERSONATED HIM.

05:25.658 --> 05:27.410
- WHAT?

05:31.831 --> 05:37.837
[beeping]

05:37.920 --> 05:39.881
- SUSAN...

05:39.964 --> 05:43.843
I KNOW YOU CAN'T SPEAK,
BUT I PRAY YOU CAN HEAR ME.

05:46.179 --> 05:47.597
SEEING YOU
IN THIS MISERABLE STATE,

05:47.680 --> 05:49.807
I CAN'T HELP IT--

05:49.891 --> 05:52.435
OH, WHAT AM I DOING?

05:52.518 --> 05:53.770
AM I REALLY SO SHALLOW

05:53.853 --> 05:56.439
THAT I CAN ONLY QUOTE WORDS
WRITTEN BY PEOPLE

05:56.522 --> 05:59.650
NOT PRETTY ENOUGH
TO BE IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA?

06:02.320 --> 06:04.655
ALL RIGHT,
THE TRUTH IS,

06:04.739 --> 06:09.243
SEEING YOU HERE
IN THIS HEARTBREAKING, YET,

06:09.327 --> 06:13.790
ODDLY WELL-GROOMED,
STATE--

06:13.873 --> 06:18.127
I'M HONESTLY SORRY FOR--
WELL, FOR SO MANY THINGS.

06:18.211 --> 06:22.048
FOR THE VENOMOUS DIGS
AND THE BACKHANDED COMPLIMENTS.

06:22.131 --> 06:26.344
FOR RESENTING YOUR SUCCESSES
AND REVELING IN YOUR DEFEATS.

06:26.427 --> 06:29.514
FOR RUBBING THAT STRAWBERRY
ON YOUR PROP KLEENEX

06:29.597 --> 06:30.640
SO THAT YOUR PERFECT
LITTLE FACE

06:30.723 --> 06:33.518
WOULD BLOW UP
LIKE A BEACH BALL--

06:40.441 --> 06:43.152
OH GOD,
I HAVE BEEN SUCH A FOOL.

06:43.236 --> 06:45.655
WHY DID WE ALWAYS LET
PETTY JEALOUSY

06:45.738 --> 06:48.908
BLIND US TO WHAT WAS
REALLY IMPORTANT?

06:48.991 --> 06:51.869
I MEAN, IF THE HEAVENS CAN HOLD
A THOUSAND BRILLIANT STARS,

06:51.953 --> 06:57.333
THEN SURELY THERE'S ROOM ENOUGH
FOR BOTH OF OUR LIGHTS TO SHINE.

06:57.416 --> 07:00.002
IF I HAD KNOWN THAT SOONER,

07:00.086 --> 07:03.297
THEN PERHAPS I WOULDN'T HAVE
MADE AN ENEMY OF SOMEONE

07:03.381 --> 07:07.593
WHO MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN
A DEAR, DEAR FRIEND.

07:21.566 --> 07:23.401
- OH, THANK GOD.
THE COUPLE MADE UP.

07:23.484 --> 07:25.361
MY HOUSE SALE'S BACK ON.

07:25.444 --> 07:27.530
THIS IS A REALLY BIG STUDIO.

07:27.613 --> 07:29.699
HOW IN THE WORLD ARE WE EVER
GOING TO FIND ROBERT REDFORD?

07:29.782 --> 07:31.242
- LET'S ASK
THIS HOLLYWOOD FAIRY.

07:31.325 --> 07:33.411
- ELKA!

07:33.494 --> 07:35.037
I'M SO SORRY,
SHE'S FROM A DIFFERENT ERA.

07:35.121 --> 07:36.747
- I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT HIM!

07:36.831 --> 07:39.375
I'M TALKING ABOUT HER.

07:41.627 --> 07:42.879
HAVE YOU SEEN
ROBERT REDFORD?

07:42.962 --> 07:44.881
- WE HEARD HE WAS
DOING HIS MOVIE HERE.

07:44.964 --> 07:47.049
- SEE THAT LINE OF EXTRAS
OVER THERE GETTING WARDROBE?

07:47.133 --> 07:48.509
THAT'S FOR HIS MOVIE.

07:48.593 --> 07:50.887
- THAT'S IT!
WE COULD BE EXTRAS!

07:50.970 --> 07:52.263
- NO.
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

07:52.346 --> 07:54.390
THERE ARE RULES,
THERE ARE UNIONS.

07:54.473 --> 07:56.058
YOU CAN'T JUST WALK
ONTO A MOVIE SET.

07:56.142 --> 07:58.352
- OH, YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT.

07:58.436 --> 08:01.898
I JUST THOUGHT,
AFTER MY TRIAL,

08:01.981 --> 08:04.567
WHEN I'M IN THAT COLD,
DARK CELL...

08:04.650 --> 08:06.194
- YOU ARE NOT
GOING TO GUILT ME INTO THIS.

08:06.277 --> 08:08.613
- MY SPIRITS WOULD SOAR
ON THE WINGS OF A MEMORY.

08:08.696 --> 08:11.115
- STOP IT!
- THE MEMORY OF MEETING,

08:11.199 --> 08:14.410
AND GETTING THE TINIEST BIT
HANDSY WITH ROBERT--

08:14.493 --> 08:17.747
- OH, FINE,
ALL RIGHT.

08:17.830 --> 08:19.874
- ALL RIGHT. WE CAN
CATCH A RIDE WITH THIS FRUIT.

08:19.957 --> 08:21.417
- OH, WAIT A MINUTE.
WHEN I TURN AROUND,

08:21.500 --> 08:23.920
I BETTER SEE A MAN
DRESSED LIKE A BANANA.

08:26.631 --> 08:32.553
CLOSE ENOUGH.

08:32.636 --> 08:33.554
- OH, NO.

08:33.638 --> 08:34.972
THEY'RE BLOCKING THE PATH
TO MY DRESSING ROOM

08:35.056 --> 08:38.226
LIKE ANGRY VILLAGERS.

08:38.308 --> 08:40.269
- THE DIRECTOR'S SMILING
AND WAVING YOU OVER.

08:40.352 --> 08:41.812
- OF COURSE HE IS.
THIS IS HOLLYWOOD.

08:41.895 --> 08:42.605
YOU KNOW,
TWO AIR KISSES

08:42.688 --> 08:44.106
BEFORE THEY STAB YOU
IN THE BACK

08:44.190 --> 08:46.776
AND GLOAT
OVER YOUR CARCASS.

08:46.859 --> 08:49.320
- SPEAKING OF BLOODY CARCASSES,
I BELIEVE I OWE

08:49.403 --> 08:52.323
MY NEW EX-BOYFRIEND
MICHAEL KNIGHT A VISIT.

08:52.406 --> 08:57.453
HMM, I WONDER IF THIS WORKS
ON MORE THAN JUST BAGELS?

08:57.536 --> 08:59.121
- VICTORIA, A WORD.

08:59.205 --> 09:00.790
- LISTEN,
BEFORE YOU SAY ANYTHING--

09:00.873 --> 09:03.376
- WE WANT YOU TO DO
YOUR ORIGINAL SPEECH.

09:03.459 --> 09:05.461
- PARDON?
- THE HOSPITAL CALLED.

09:05.544 --> 09:07.797
SUSAN'S FINE, BUT SHE JUST
NEEDS SOME TIME TO RECUPERATE.

09:07.880 --> 09:10.258
- COULD YOU REPEAT
THAT FIRST PART, AGAIN?

09:10.341 --> 09:11.133
- SUSAN IS FINE.

09:11.217 --> 09:12.927
- NO, NO, NO,
THE PART ABOUT MY SPEECH.

09:13.010 --> 09:14.845
AM I REALLY
GETTING IT BACK?

09:14.929 --> 09:16.430
- YES.

09:16.514 --> 09:18.140
WE WANT YOU TO DELIVER IT
TO A PHOTOGRAPH OF SUSAN.

09:18.224 --> 09:19.517
NOW, OF COURSE,
IF YOU'RE NOT COMFORTABLE

09:19.600 --> 09:20.768
DOING THE SCENE
WITHOUT HER,

09:20.851 --> 09:22.270
WE CAN WAIT--
- NO, NO, NO.

09:22.353 --> 09:25.481
AS MUCH AS IT PAINS ME TO
PERFORM THE ENTIRE SCENE ALONE--

09:25.564 --> 09:26.941
NO HEAD BANDAGES,
RIGHT?

09:27.024 --> 09:28.150
- RIGHT.

09:28.234 --> 09:30.653
- TO DO THE WHOLE SCENE
ENTIRELY ALONE,

09:30.736 --> 09:32.154
I KNOW THAT IF SUSAN
WERE STANDING HERE,

09:32.238 --> 09:34.532
SHE'D BE LOOKING WAY,
WAY UP AT THE REST OF US,

09:34.615 --> 09:39.161
SAYING, "OH, VICTORIA,
PLEASE, DO THIS FOR ME."

09:39.245 --> 09:40.663
TISSUE!

09:41.622 --> 09:43.582
WATER!

09:45.251 --> 09:46.794
SANDWICH.

09:51.090 --> 09:54.427
- THAT'S HOW SUSAN KEEPS WARM
BETWEEN TAKES.

09:58.723 --> 10:00.975
AND, ACTION.

10:01.058 --> 10:02.893
- OH, ERICA.

10:02.977 --> 10:06.022
I KNOW YOU CAN'T HEAR ME,
BUT WHEREVER YOU ARE,

10:06.105 --> 10:08.816
I PRAY THAT YOU KNOW
THAT I KNOW,

10:08.899 --> 10:10.860
THAT YOU WISH YOU HAD
BEEN THERE TO WARN ME

10:10.943 --> 10:14.905
THAT LIZA HAD SABOTAGED
THAT STAIRWAY.

10:16.449 --> 10:22.580
[applause]

10:22.663 --> 10:23.539
THANK YOU,
THANK YOU,

10:23.622 --> 10:26.375
BUT I WAS MERELY
TAKING A DRAMATIC PAUSE.

10:26.459 --> 10:29.378
PLEASE HOLD YOUR APPLAUSE
UNTIL I HAVE COMPLETED...

10:29.462 --> 10:32.214
THE SCENE.

10:32.298 --> 10:34.216
- I BELIEVE
THEY WERE CLAPPING FOR ME.

10:34.300 --> 10:36.677
- OH, HELL.

10:36.761 --> 10:37.928
SUSAN!

10:38.012 --> 10:39.430
- THIS IS AMAZING.

10:39.513 --> 10:41.265
WE THOUGHT YOU WERE
TAKING SOME TIME OFF.

10:41.349 --> 10:42.892
- AND LET POOR VICTORIA
STUMBLE THROUGH THE SCENE

10:42.975 --> 10:44.393
ALL ALONE?

10:44.477 --> 10:49.190
WHAT KIND OF A FRIEND
AND YOUNGER MENTOR WOULD I BE?

10:49.273 --> 10:51.233
- BUT SURELY
AFTER YOUR LONG COMA,

10:51.317 --> 10:53.069
YOU COULD USE
A LITTLE REST.

10:53.152 --> 10:54.528
- ON THE CONTRARY.

10:54.612 --> 10:58.240
IN SPITE OF MY ALLEGED
"ACCIDENT," I FEEL FINE.

10:58.324 --> 11:01.660
SO, SHOULD WE SHOOT THE SCENE
THE WAY WE REHEARSED IT?

11:01.744 --> 11:03.746
- OH, WHAT A TROOPER!

11:03.829 --> 11:06.248
WHAT DO YOU SAY, VICTORIA?
HMM?

11:06.332 --> 11:09.043
- I'M SPEECHLESS.

11:09.126 --> 11:11.587
- YOU ARE NOW.

11:14.006 --> 11:17.009
- WHERE EXACTLY DOES IT SAY
"FERRARI" ON THE JACKET?

11:17.093 --> 11:19.720
UH?
FRONT AND BACK?

11:19.804 --> 11:20.930
I'LL TAKE IT.

11:21.013 --> 11:23.557
[knock on door]
OH, I'VE GOT TO GO.

11:23.641 --> 11:26.936
AND,<i> CIAO!</i>

11:27.019 --> 11:28.437
COME IN.

11:30.981 --> 11:32.149
- HELLO, MICHAEL.

11:32.233 --> 11:33.734
- HELLO, GORGEOUS.

11:33.818 --> 11:38.406
LISTEN. I--I'VE GOT
A LOVE SCENE COMING UP.

11:38.489 --> 11:39.990
WANT TO HELP ME REHEARSE?

11:40.074 --> 11:43.619
- I WOULD, BUT SOMETHING AWFUL'S
JUST HAPPENED.

11:43.702 --> 11:48.124
- I KNOW.
LUCCI IS BACK.

11:48.207 --> 11:51.961
BUT, FACE IT,
THERE'S NO SHOW WITHOUT HER.

11:52.044 --> 11:53.546
- IT'S NOT THAT.

11:53.629 --> 11:55.131
JUST NOW,
WHEN I WAS IN THE PARKING LOT,

11:55.214 --> 11:57.466
ADMIRING YOUR BRAND NEW
FERRARI--

11:57.550 --> 11:59.301
I RAN INTO ALEX!

11:59.385 --> 12:01.846
- WHAT?

12:01.929 --> 12:03.681
- YOUR EVIL TWIN.

12:03.764 --> 12:05.307
AND WHEN I TOLD HIM
YOU AND I WERE TOGETHER,

12:05.391 --> 12:07.309
HE FLEW INTO
A JEALOUS RAGE,

12:07.393 --> 12:11.605
AND STARTED ATTACKING YOUR
GORGEOUS NEW CAR WITH A CROWBAR.

12:13.190 --> 12:14.650
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

12:14.733 --> 12:16.152
- OH, IT WAS HORRIBLE.

12:16.235 --> 12:18.654
HE SHATTERED THE WINDSHIELD,
HE SLASHED THE TIRES,

12:18.737 --> 12:22.992
HE EVEN RIPPED THAT CUTE LITTLE
PRANCING HORSE OFF THE HOOD.

12:23.075 --> 12:25.202
- I DON'T HAVE
AN EVIL TWIN!

12:25.286 --> 12:28.456
- AND NOW, YOU DON'T HAVE
A FERRARI, EITHER.

12:38.883 --> 12:41.177
- WHY DID WE ALWAYS LET
PETTY JEALOUSY

12:41.260 --> 12:44.180
BLIND US TO WHAT'S
REALLY IMPORTANT?

12:44.263 --> 12:50.019
IF THE HEAVENS CAN HOLD
A THOUSAND BRILLIANT STARS,

12:50.102 --> 12:56.025
SURELY THERE'S ROOM ENOUGH
FOR BOTH OUR LIGHTS TO SHINE.

12:56.108 --> 12:59.361
IF ONLY I HAD
REALIZED THIS SOONER,

12:59.445 --> 13:02.823
PERHAPS I WOULDN'T HAVE MADE
AN ENEMY OUT OF SOMEONE

13:02.907 --> 13:08.662
WHO MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN
A DEAR, DEAR FRIEND.

13:08.746 --> 13:12.875
[applause]

13:12.958 --> 13:15.211
- SUSAN, THAT WAS FANTASTIC.

13:15.294 --> 13:17.546
THOSE LAST LINES--
THEY WEREN'T EVEN IN THE SCRIPT!

13:17.630 --> 13:19.006
- I KNOW.

13:19.089 --> 13:21.759
I WAS JUST LYING
IN MY HOSPITAL BED TODAY,

13:21.842 --> 13:23.302
THEY JUST CAME TO ME.

13:23.385 --> 13:25.221
- "LYING" ALL RIGHT.

13:25.304 --> 13:26.180
- WRITING AND ACTING,

13:26.263 --> 13:29.016
IS THERE ANYTHING
THIS ONE CANNOT DO, HMM?

13:29.099 --> 13:35.231
[applause]

13:35.314 --> 13:39.610
- TO BE HONEST,
I OWE IT ALL TO VICTORIA.

13:39.693 --> 13:41.195
- WELL, THANK YOU, SUSAN.

13:41.278 --> 13:44.365
- HER PORTRAYAL
OF A LIFELESS VEGETABLE

13:44.448 --> 13:48.702
WAS JUST SO CONVINCING
THAT IT MADE MY JOB EFFORTLESS.

13:48.786 --> 13:50.704
- [growls]

13:54.500 --> 13:56.126
- OH, ROBERT.

13:56.210 --> 14:00.756
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU FEEL THE SAME WAY TOO.

14:00.839 --> 14:02.967
- REALLY?

14:03.050 --> 14:04.927
YOU HONESTLY THINK
ROBERT REDFORD'S

14:05.010 --> 14:06.762
GOING TO LOOK ACROSS
THIS IMAGINARY OCEAN

14:06.845 --> 14:08.722
AND ASK YOU
TO MARRY HIM?

14:08.806 --> 14:12.434
- HE'S BEEN DOING IT
IN MY HEAD FOR 30 YEARS.

14:12.518 --> 14:14.979
- ELKA!

14:15.062 --> 14:19.984
- THE SERVANTS SHOULD BE SEEN
AND NOT HEARD.

14:20.067 --> 14:22.486
- OKAY, REMEMBER, WE ARE
GOING TO CGI IN

14:22.570 --> 14:23.821
THE STORM
AND THE OCEAN.

14:23.904 --> 14:26.448
BUT WE NEED YOU TO PRETEND
TO BE FREEZING,

14:26.532 --> 14:29.785
AND YOU ARE DESPERATE
TO BE RESCUED, ALL RIGHT?

14:29.868 --> 14:31.120
OKAY,
WE'RE READY TO SHOOT.

14:31.203 --> 14:34.164
- OH, BUT ROBERT REDFORD
ISN'T HERE YET.

14:34.248 --> 14:37.710
- LADY,
THIS IS SECOND UNIT.

14:37.793 --> 14:40.296
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

14:40.379 --> 14:43.340
- IT MEANS THERE ARE NO STARS
IN THIS SCENE.

14:43.424 --> 14:45.801
SO THIS HAS JUST BEEN
A BIG OLD WASTE OF TIME.

14:45.884 --> 14:48.637
AND THESE THINGS ARE REALLY
ITCHY, I CAN'T STAND IT.

14:48.721 --> 14:49.972
MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST GO.

14:50.055 --> 14:54.059
- NO, HE'LL SEE ME
IN EDITING.

14:54.143 --> 14:58.147
AND HE'LL SAY,
"WHO IS THAT BEAUTIFUL EXTRA?"

14:58.230 --> 15:01.483
AND HE'LL TRACK ME DOWN--

15:01.567 --> 15:03.611
- THAT'S RIDICULOUS,
I'M STARTING TO GET HIVES.

15:03.694 --> 15:05.988
CAN WE JUST PLEASE GO?

15:06.071 --> 15:08.991
- OH, ALL RIGHT!

15:09.074 --> 15:12.995
MAYBE I'LL GET
A SOLITARY CELL.

15:13.078 --> 15:16.332
LESS LIKELY
TO GET SHANKED.

15:16.415 --> 15:17.499
- FINE.
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

15:17.583 --> 15:18.500
ON THE BRIGHT SIDE,

15:18.584 --> 15:20.127
I GET TO BE IN A ROBERT REDFORD
MOVIE, RIGHT?

15:20.210 --> 15:22.129
- AND ACTION!
CUE THE WAVES.

15:22.212 --> 15:24.006
- WAVES?

15:26.884 --> 15:28.344
- REMEMBER,
IT'S FREEZING.

15:28.427 --> 15:30.679
YOU'RE TERRIFIED.
OH, HERE COMES ANOTHER ONE.

15:30.763 --> 15:33.474
- WHAT?

15:33.557 --> 15:34.683
- NOW, OVER YOUR SHOULDER--

15:34.767 --> 15:36.852
OH, GOD, HERE COMES
THE BIGGEST ONE YET.

15:36.935 --> 15:38.646
- NOOOO!

15:38.729 --> 15:41.231
[water splashing]

15:48.072 --> 15:49.865
- I CAN'T GET THE WATER
OUT OF MY--

15:49.948 --> 15:52.326
OH, THERE WE GO.

15:52.409 --> 15:54.995
- MAYBE I'M JUST NOT MEANT
FOR ROMANCE.

15:55.079 --> 15:57.706
MAYBE I'M MISSING
A CHIP OR SOMETHING.

15:57.790 --> 15:58.666
- OH, SWEETIE,
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

15:58.749 --> 16:00.751
I MEAN, IT COULD HAVE
HAPPENED TO ANYBODY.

16:00.834 --> 16:03.671
- A ONE-NIGHT STAND
WITH THE SAME MAN TWICE?

16:06.465 --> 16:08.217
HOW COULD I BE SO STUPID?

16:08.300 --> 16:10.511
- WELL, TO BE FAIR,
HE IS A PROFESSIONAL ACTOR,

16:10.594 --> 16:14.014
AND HE HAD YOU CONVINCED
THAT HE WAS HIS OWN EVIL TWIN.

16:14.098 --> 16:17.393
[laughter]

16:17.476 --> 16:19.937
- OH, MY GOD!
- I KNOW, I KNOW.

16:20.020 --> 16:21.730
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE WE
SAT AROUND THIS TABLE

16:21.814 --> 16:24.358
HASHING OVER
YOUR BAD BOYFRIENDS?

16:24.441 --> 16:25.567
ERIC,
THE BIGAMIST--

16:25.651 --> 16:27.569
DONALD
WITH THE ANT FARM--

16:27.653 --> 16:28.904
- PRE-OP ANDY--

16:28.987 --> 16:32.116
WHO TURNED INTO AWKWARD
FIRST-DATE ANDREA--

16:34.159 --> 16:36.412
- I NEED COFFEE.

16:36.495 --> 16:37.871
I HAD LUCCI NIGHTMARES
ALL NIGHT.

16:37.955 --> 16:39.540
I CAN STILL FEEL
THAT LITTLE MUPPET HAND

16:39.623 --> 16:42.584
ON MY MOUTH.

16:42.668 --> 16:44.878
- WELL,
JOY HAS GOOD NEWS FOR YOU.

16:44.962 --> 16:45.754
- I CALLED
<i>ALL MY CHILDREN</i>

16:45.838 --> 16:47.589
AND THREATENED
A SEXUAL HARASSMENT SUIT

16:47.673 --> 16:49.591
AGAINST A CERTAIN ACTOR

16:49.675 --> 16:50.884
UNLESS THEY KILL
THE HOSPITAL SCENE

16:50.968 --> 16:52.720
AND WROTE YOU
A NEW PART.

16:52.803 --> 16:54.304
THEY'RE FLYING YOU OUT AGAIN
NEXT WEEK.

16:54.388 --> 16:57.307
- OH, JOY,
THANK YOU!

16:57.391 --> 17:00.394
THAT YOU WOULD DO SOMETHING
SO CONNIVING FOR ME--

17:00.477 --> 17:04.064
WELL,
YOU'RE A TRUE FRIEND.

17:04.147 --> 17:05.898
SO,
WHAT KIND OF PART IS IT?

17:05.983 --> 17:07.151
- ONE WITH HAIR.

17:07.233 --> 17:08.819
AND THEY PROMISED ME
IT WOULD BE JUICY.

17:08.902 --> 17:10.612
- OH, WELL.
IF IT'S HALF AS JUICY

17:10.695 --> 17:13.115
AS THE STRAWBERRY I SQUEEZED
INTO SUSAN'S MOISTURIZER

17:13.198 --> 17:15.992
BEFORE I LEFT--

17:16.076 --> 17:17.953
I'M GOING TO BE THRILLED.

17:18.037 --> 17:20.955
MEL, HONEY,
IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG?

17:21.039 --> 17:23.333
- SHE'S STILL UPSET
ABOUT SELLING HER FURNITURE.

17:23.416 --> 17:25.252
- NO, NO, I'VE RESIGNED MYSELF
TO THE FURNITURE.

17:25.335 --> 17:28.630
I JUST--

17:28.714 --> 17:30.632
NOW I'M JUST SORRY
I SOLD THE HOUSE.

17:30.716 --> 17:35.095
- AW, SWEETIE,
IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.

17:35.179 --> 17:36.972
- IT'S A GOOD THING.
IT'S WHAT YOU WANTED.

17:37.055 --> 17:39.975
- I KNOW, BUT WHEN I LOOK OUT
THESE WINDOWS,

17:40.058 --> 17:44.480
I CAN STILL SEE MY KIDS
PLAYING IN THE YARD.

17:44.563 --> 17:47.316
NO OTHER WINDOWS
CAN DO THAT FOR ME.

17:47.399 --> 17:48.317
AND THIS DOOR JAMB,

17:48.400 --> 17:51.570
THIS IS WHERE I MEASURED
THE KIDS' HEIGHT.

17:51.653 --> 17:53.822
LOOK, THIS IS HOW TALL
JENNA WAS

17:53.906 --> 17:55.532
WHEN WE MADE CHRISTMAS COOKIES
FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME

17:55.616 --> 17:56.533
AND SHE DROPPED THE BOWL.

17:56.617 --> 17:57.951
RIGHT THERE--

17:58.035 --> 18:02.039
SEE? THERE'S THIS LITTLE CRACK
IN THE--

18:02.122 --> 18:04.416
HOW AM I GOING TO SAY GOODBYE
TO THAT CRACK?

18:04.500 --> 18:05.876
- I DON'T KNOW,
BUT YOU BETTER MAKE IT QUICK,

18:05.959 --> 18:08.337
OUR FLIGHT'S AT NOON.

18:10.547 --> 18:12.257
- NO, NO, OUR FLIGHT'S
NOT TILL 5:00.

18:12.341 --> 18:14.927
- OH, I GOT A TWEET
FROM KEMIL.

18:15.010 --> 18:16.804
ROBERT REDFORD'S LEAVING
FOR SALT LAKE CITY,

18:16.887 --> 18:20.349
AND I RE-BOOKED US
ON HIS FLIGHT.

18:20.432 --> 18:22.810
- YOU'RE GOING TO KANSAS?

18:25.145 --> 18:26.855
- UTAH.

18:26.939 --> 18:30.984
- I DEFY ANYONE TO TELL ME
THE DIFFERENCE.

18:31.068 --> 18:33.862
- IT'S JUST
A FIVE-HOUR LAYOVER.

18:33.946 --> 18:37.741
OH, PLEASE.

18:37.825 --> 18:39.576
- OH,
SPARE US THE DIMPLES.

18:39.660 --> 18:42.704
- YOU HAVE NO POWER OVER US,
OLD WOMAN.

18:42.788 --> 18:43.872
- OH, I DON'T CARE ANYMORE.

18:43.956 --> 18:47.876
I'M SO MISERABLE
I JUST WANT TO GO HOME.

18:47.960 --> 18:52.214
OH, MY GOSH!
I JUST SAID I WANT TO GO HOME.

18:52.297 --> 18:55.050
- YES, HONEY,
WE WERE HERE.

18:55.134 --> 18:59.721
- NO! WHEN I SAID "HOME,"
I MEANT CLEVELAND.

18:59.805 --> 19:01.390
- I KNOW, IT'S WEIRD,
ISN'T IT?

19:01.473 --> 19:03.267
I'VE BEEN THINKING OF CLEVELAND
AS HOME TOO.

19:03.350 --> 19:04.852
- ME TOO.

19:04.935 --> 19:06.353
ONLY, I WISH WE COULD
GET THERE NONSTOP.

19:06.436 --> 19:08.814
WE ARE AT LEAST
FLYING FIRST CLASS?

19:08.897 --> 19:10.983
- ONE OF US IS.

19:13.652 --> 19:15.028
- I DON'T KNOW.

19:15.112 --> 19:17.781
YOU KNOW, I'M SINGLE NOW,
THE KIDS ARE GROWN,

19:17.865 --> 19:20.951
AND A HOUSE REALLY ISN'T A HOME
WITHOUT PEOPLE IN IT.

19:21.034 --> 19:24.746
WHEREVER YOU GUYS ARE--
THAT'S HOME TO ME.

19:24.830 --> 19:26.206
- GOOD,
THEN SHAKE A LEG.

19:26.290 --> 19:28.750
YOU KNOW HOW LONG
SECURITY TAKES,

19:28.834 --> 19:31.628
AND I ALWAYS GET PROFILED.

19:34.339 --> 19:36.592
- YOU GUYS GO AHEAD.

19:36.675 --> 19:39.303
I JUST NEED TO DO
ONE THING.

19:39.386 --> 19:42.431
[hammer thudding]

19:42.514 --> 19:46.977
[sighs]
NOW IT'S HOME.
