This looks great, Michael.

02:25.187 --> 02:26.562

more about the day-to-day
operations of the company.

02:55.592 --> 02:57.009
Okay? Yeah.

02:58.428 --> 03:01.722

Michael, stop for a second.

l can't do this.

04:20.928 --> 04:22.637
This is pathetic, isn't it?

04:22.721 --> 04:23.804
(SlGHS)

04:23.889 --> 04:25.640
l am such an idiot.

04:25.766 --> 04:28.851

l ever loved to do this?

04:33.231 --> 04:35.191
l have egg in my Crocs.

04:36.818 --> 04:40.029
l never see him drink.
l never see him eat.

04:40.113 --> 04:42.657
l don't think
he even uses
the bathroom.

04:42.741 --> 04:45.159
Oh, he does. He does.

04:45.369 --> 04:47.078
l feel weak today.

04:47.537 --> 04:49.872
l felt much
stronger yesterday.

04:50.499 --> 04:52.416
Like Benjamin Button
in reverse.

04:52.501 --> 04:54.543
You know, Michael,
when l feel overwhelmed. . .

04:54.628 --> 04:56.170
l'm not overwhelmed, Pam.

04:56.254 --> 04:59.799
l know.
No, l'm saying that
when l feel overwhelmed,

04:59.883 --> 05:02.885
something l like to do
is make a list.

05:03.637 --> 05:06.430
(EXHALES)
Make a list of
things to do,

05:06.515 --> 05:08.015
and then start with
the easy stuff.

05:08.100 --> 05:09.141
Whatever calms you down.

05:09.226 --> 05:12.144
Okay, first, work out.

05:12.562 --> 05:15.106
And hey, look,
you did that.

05:15.983 --> 05:17.149
Check.

05:17.818 --> 05:19.860
Eat an enormous breakfast.

05:20.737 --> 05:22.863
Check.
Don't patronize me, Pam.

05:22.948 --> 05:23.948
l think you should
get dressed.

05:24.032 --> 05:25.241
l'm not getting dressed.

05:25.325 --> 05:28.828
l'm not getting dressed.
l have too many things
to do before l get dressed.

05:28.912 --> 05:30.371
l need to find 1 00 clients.

05:30.455 --> 05:31.831
Michael,
that seems impossible.

05:31.915 --> 05:32.957
lt's totally impossible.

05:33.041 --> 05:38.129
We need to come up with
one realistic thing that
we could do today.

05:38.505 --> 05:40.923
Assemble a sales team.
A dream team.

05:41.008 --> 05:42.091
Great.

05:42.175 --> 05:43.384
Okay, Ryan.

05:43.468 --> 05:45.594
No. What? Why?

05:45.679 --> 05:48.097
He's everything l'm not,
and everything l am.

05:48.181 --> 05:49.390
He's the whole package.

05:49.474 --> 05:50.766
No, we're not
gonna hire Ryan.

05:50.851 --> 05:54.353
Um. . . Oh, Vikram !
Best salesman
l've ever met.

05:54.938 --> 05:57.732
Okay.
He worked at that
telemarketing place.

05:57.816 --> 05:59.150
We'll find him.
Okay.

05:59.234 --> 06:03.112
Oh, also, we have
a meeting this afternoon
with a potential investor.

06:03.196 --> 06:04.238
Really?
Yeah.

06:04.281 --> 06:05.740
We have an investor
already?
Maybe.

06:05.824 --> 06:07.783
Barbara Keavis.
She invests in
local businesses

06:07.868 --> 06:10.745
and l'm putting together
a little presentation for her.

06:10.829 --> 06:12.079
Michael, that's fantastic.

06:12.164 --> 06:13.914
Yeah, l guess
it's not so bad.

06:13.999 --> 06:15.708
Got a few things cooking.

06:16.001 --> 06:17.084
Um. . .

06:17.169 --> 06:19.462
Hey! We need to
get you dressed.

06:19.629 --> 06:21.338
l have doubts
about this, too,

06:21.423 --> 06:22.965
but when one person
freaks out,

06:23.050 --> 06:26.302
sometimes it weirdly makes
the other one calmer.

06:26.428 --> 06:29.430
That's one thing
l've learned
about relationships.

06:29.514 --> 06:32.641
l hate that l just used
the word "relationship."

06:32.893 --> 06:35.144
Hey! You look great!

06:37.147 --> 06:38.939
Let's go.
All right.

06:45.238 --> 06:47.656
Oh, yeah,
l'm so embarrassed.

06:48.033 --> 06:50.284
You weren't supposed
to see this. This is
like my secret obsession.

06:50.368 --> 06:52.661
Yeah, well,
that makes two of us.

06:52.746 --> 06:53.746
No way!
Yeah.

06:53.830 --> 06:55.331
l hate soccer.

06:55.999 --> 06:57.917
But guess who doesn't
hate soccer.

06:58.001 --> 06:59.168
Charles Miner.

06:59.252 --> 07:02.505

in Germany for the
2006 World Cup finals.

07:02.589 --> 07:03.798
(GASPS)

07:04.299 --> 07:06.759

That should have been me!

07:06.843 --> 07:09.595
Yeah, l love the sport.
l love the sport.
All right, man.

07:09.679 --> 07:10.763
Cool !

07:13.600 --> 07:15.684
l've never been a kiss-up.

07:16.353 --> 07:18.771
l. . . lt's just not
how l operate.

07:19.564 --> 07:21.148
l mean, l've always
subscribed to the idea

07:21.233 --> 07:23.359
that if you really want
to impress your boss,

07:23.443 --> 07:27.113
you go in there,
and you do mediocre work,
half-heartedly.

07:27.823 --> 07:30.741
Next on the list,
open the mail.

07:30.826 --> 07:34.036

Whoa, and he just
goes, boom, goal !
Yeah, that's. . . That's Pele.

08:16.705 --> 08:18.122
You know your soccer, man.
l do.

08:18.206 --> 08:21.834
l prefer Maradona.
Diego Maradona.

08:21.960 --> 08:23.335
Oh, yeah?
From Argentina.

08:23.420 --> 08:26.422
l didn't know we had
so many soccer fans
in the office.

08:26.506 --> 08:28.966
l mean, to be fair,
l was the first one
to talk about it, but. . .

08:29.050 --> 08:31.093
CHARLES: Yeah,
what about you, Jim?
You a fan of the game?

08:31.178 --> 08:33.012
Oh, no. No, not really.

08:33.096 --> 08:35.347
Well, it's not for
everybody, l suppose.

08:35.432 --> 08:36.640
(BOTH LAUGHlNG)

08:36.725 --> 08:38.851
That's 'cause l'm more
of a player.

08:38.935 --> 08:39.977
Oh, yeah?
You bet.

08:40.061 --> 08:41.478
Really, Jim?

08:42.981 --> 08:45.316
l had no idea
you played soccer.

08:45.775 --> 08:48.611
'Cause you never,
ever talk about it.

08:49.362 --> 08:50.529
Well, l do. l play.
DWlGHT: Wow!

08:50.614 --> 08:51.947
You can be so
modest sometimes.

08:52.032 --> 08:53.115
Maybe we should
get back to work.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.868
Maybe you and Charles
should kick the
soccer ball around.

08:55.952 --> 08:56.952
Maybe we will someday.

08:57.037 --> 08:58.829
Maybe you will
tonight after work.
What do you say?

08:58.914 --> 09:00.372
lt's a great idea, Dwight.

09:00.457 --> 09:03.375
Great ideas
are just part of what
l bring to the table.

09:03.460 --> 09:04.501
(CHUCKLES)

09:04.586 --> 09:06.045
l don't try and be
anything that l'm not.

09:06.129 --> 09:08.464
What do you say, Jim?
Huh, want to play
some soccer?

09:08.548 --> 09:09.590
Hey, anybody else?

09:09.674 --> 09:10.633
ANDY: l'm into that.
Sounds fun.

09:10.759 --> 09:12.509
Game on !
Okay.

09:12.761 --> 09:14.887
See you on the field,
Jim-bro.
See. . .

09:14.971 --> 09:16.555
CHARLES: (LAUGHS)
l can't wait!

09:17.015 --> 09:19.642
Yep, l used to play
soccer in school.

09:19.976 --> 09:22.102
From second
to fourth grade.

09:22.312 --> 09:24.021
l was on the orange team.

09:29.236 --> 09:31.320
We got Vikram !
You got me.

09:32.322 --> 09:34.114
Where are we going?

09:34.282 --> 09:35.574
We have a meeting
with an investor today.

09:35.659 --> 09:38.661
Yes, we do,
so get excited.

09:39.829 --> 09:43.332
But l have to go
to the bathroom
real quick.

09:43.833 --> 09:46.585
lf you'll excuse me,
l'll be right back.

09:48.588 --> 09:50.756
VlKRAM: He seems
really confident.
He can be.

09:50.840 --> 09:52.341
Confidence. . .

09:52.676 --> 09:56.345
lt's the food
of the wise man, but
the liquor of the fool.

09:56.680 --> 09:57.680
Hmm.

09:57.764 --> 10:01.433
l'm looking forward
to getting to know
you better, Vikram.

10:01.559 --> 10:05.396
Hey, l would like
a pair of Size 9, please.

10:07.315 --> 10:09.817
lt's Michael.
l'm swamped, Michael.

10:09.901 --> 10:12.236
Happy birthday
to SaIIy in Lane 27.

10:12.320 --> 10:16.782
Okay, imagine a company
that has no memory of
your past misconduct,

10:16.866 --> 10:18.951
because they have no files.

10:21.830 --> 10:23.831
VlKRAM: He's taking
a long time.

10:24.207 --> 10:25.624
ls it possible
he's bowling?

10:25.709 --> 10:28.335
l mean, you know him
better than l do.

10:28.878 --> 10:31.964
Yes. Yes, it's possible.

10:35.093 --> 10:38.137
Well, he's always been
a lifelong friend. . .
PAM: Michael !

10:38.221 --> 10:39.305
What's going on?

10:39.389 --> 10:41.598
l'm. . .
Hey, Ryan.

10:41.808 --> 10:42.975
Excuse me. Yes?

10:43.059 --> 10:44.226
This wasn't on the list.

10:44.311 --> 10:46.061
Yes, it is.
No.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.271
Yes.
lt's not.

10:47.355 --> 10:48.564
lt is.

10:48.690 --> 10:49.815
When did you add this
to the list?

10:49.899 --> 10:53.402
Pam, everyone deserves
a second, second chance.

10:55.780 --> 10:58.240
Ryan, just out
of curiosity, how much
do you get paid here?

10:58.325 --> 10:59.908
$60,000 a year.

11:00.243 --> 11:02.286
You get paid by the year
at the bowling alley?

11:02.370 --> 11:03.495
What do you make,
secretary?

11:03.580 --> 11:05.581
Back to work, shoe bitch !

11:05.957 --> 11:07.166
l told you guys,
l'm really busy here, so. . .

11:07.250 --> 11:11.420
Would you like
to come to work for the
Michael Scott Paper Company?

11:12.213 --> 11:13.714
What size shoes
are you guys?
Uh, nine.

11:13.798 --> 11:14.882
What are those?
A men's 1 0?

11:14.966 --> 11:16.091
No.

11:16.134 --> 11:17.426
MlCHAEL: Look what
he's doing.
PAM: What is he doing?

11:17.510 --> 11:19.553
He's stealing them.
Okay, okay.
Oh, my God.

11:19.637 --> 11:22.389
He's already paying
for himself.
Sorry!

11:23.808 --> 11:25.351
Where is it?
Right here.

11:25.435 --> 11:29.146
Hey, come on, guys.
These are prime
selling hours, you know.

11:35.028 --> 11:36.153
Miner. . .
JlM: Oh, there he goes.

11:36.237 --> 11:37.863
. . .sees his partner.
Yikes.

11:37.947 --> 11:39.281
Halpert, he looks up.
Oh, man !

11:39.366 --> 11:41.617
The famed duo!
He sets him up!

11:42.202 --> 11:43.285
He sets him up!
All right.

11:43.370 --> 11:44.495
Yeah !

11:44.579 --> 11:46.038
(BOTH EXCLAlMlNG)

11:46.122 --> 11:47.331
Goal !

11:47.415 --> 11:48.499
l can't wait to play
with you.

11:48.583 --> 11:50.542
Oh, it's gonna be
the worst.

11:51.669 --> 11:53.128
Do you guys wanna hear
about Thailand?

11:53.213 --> 11:54.797
Oh, yeah.
Sure.

11:57.133 --> 11:58.926
lt was indescribable.

11:59.469 --> 12:00.636
Sounds awesome.
Neat.

12:01.304 --> 12:03.347
What sort of
investing firm is this?

12:03.431 --> 12:05.724
Vikram, you ask
a lot of questions,
and l like that.

12:05.809 --> 12:08.143
Hey, Nana! Hi !

12:08.436 --> 12:09.561
(MOUTHlNG)
NANA: Michael !

12:09.646 --> 12:11.563
People turn to their
families all the time

12:11.648 --> 12:13.107
when they need help
starting out.

12:13.191 --> 12:15.401
And if my nana's
investment club can help

12:15.485 --> 12:16.610
the Michael Scott
Paper Company

12:16.694 --> 12:20.823
become a reality, then
l'm sure that's what
she would have wanted.

12:20.990 --> 12:22.324
Does want.

12:22.826 --> 12:25.494
Well, l'm sure
that you must all have
very, very busy schedules,

12:25.578 --> 12:29.206
so l appreciate you
meeting with us here today.

12:29.499 --> 12:33.961
What this is,
is a business that l have
worked toward my entire life.

12:34.045 --> 12:35.129
Hey!

12:35.672 --> 12:37.965
l have assembled
what l believe to be

12:38.049 --> 12:42.010
the most exciting,
sought-after talent
in the industry today.

12:42.095 --> 12:45.139
Ladies and gentlemen,
l present to you
the dream team.

12:45.223 --> 12:49.351
From our very own Scranton,
Pennsylvania, Pam Beesly.

12:49.686 --> 12:52.980
Pretty Pam is always
reaching for the stars

12:53.064 --> 12:56.525
and someday,
she may just surprise
us all and grab one.

12:57.485 --> 12:58.861
Meet Vikram.

13:00.029 --> 13:03.323
From his humble
beginnings as a. . .
Stay standing.

13:04.033 --> 13:07.119
From his humble beginnings
as a prominent surgeon,

13:07.203 --> 13:11.248
he risked it all
to become the most
successful telemarketer

13:11.332 --> 13:12.749
in the lipophedrine industry.

13:12.834 --> 13:16.044
And do not call it
a comeback.

13:17.088 --> 13:20.674
The youngest vice president
in the history
of Dunder Mifflin,

13:20.758 --> 13:24.303
and recent bowling
alley employee,
Ryan Howard,

13:24.387 --> 13:27.723
is about to make
a splash in paper.

13:27.807 --> 13:28.849
So let's hear it.

13:28.933 --> 13:32.394
Okay, l have spent
the last 1 5 years

13:32.479 --> 13:35.230
learning the ins and outs
of the paper industry.

13:35.315 --> 13:38.817
With a lean, mean
fighting crew and
low overhead,

13:38.902 --> 13:41.195
l think l can perform
the same business

13:41.279 --> 13:43.530
at a much, much higher
rate of profit.

13:43.615 --> 13:46.909
How do you expect
to turn a profit
in this economy?

13:47.243 --> 13:49.786
By wanting it more,
by working hard. . .

13:49.871 --> 13:51.497
What's your mission
statement?

13:51.581 --> 13:56.251
My mission is stated
as follows.

13:56.753 --> 13:58.504
l will not be beat.

13:58.713 --> 14:00.547
l will never give up.

14:00.965 --> 14:02.424
l am on a mission.

14:02.509 --> 14:04.635
That is the
Michael Scott guarantee.

14:04.719 --> 14:06.970
Come on, Oscar.
What positions
do people play?

14:07.055 --> 14:08.597
Wing.
The leg.

14:08.890 --> 14:11.517
Jim, what do you play?
Left.

14:11.684 --> 14:13.852
Forward or half?
Forward, definitely.

14:13.937 --> 14:15.062
Okay, striker, huh?
Striker!

14:15.188 --> 14:17.356
Let's see what you
got in those legs.
All right, let's do it.

14:17.440 --> 14:18.815
All right.

14:18.900 --> 14:20.192
(BLOWlNG WHlSTLE)

14:20.276 --> 14:22.444
No, no, no. This. . .
No, this is supposed
to be the kickoff.

14:22.529 --> 14:23.779
Kickoff.

14:24.531 --> 14:27.032
My strategy
is to touch the ball
as little as possible.

14:27.116 --> 14:29.117
Chalk it up to teamwork.

14:29.536 --> 14:30.869
All right!

14:31.120 --> 14:34.623
And l offer
same-day free delivery.

14:34.791 --> 14:36.625
Michael, l don't know
about this.

14:36.709 --> 14:40.462
Nana, l really think
that Papa would want
you to do this.

14:41.923 --> 14:43.715
l'm not so sure.
Well, what is it exactly?

14:43.800 --> 14:47.094
l mean, what. . .
What specifically?
lt doesn't have to be paper.

14:47.178 --> 14:50.013
We could sell medicine
and other. . .

14:50.098 --> 14:52.349
See, this is what
concerns me.

14:52.559 --> 14:56.061
We could just
give him a chance.
lt's not much money.

14:56.145 --> 14:58.021
Well, this might not be
the right time,

14:58.106 --> 14:59.982
but l need more than
l originally asked for.

15:00.066 --> 15:03.402
This isn't a hand-out club,
it's an investment club.

15:03.945 --> 15:04.945
Okay.

15:05.029 --> 15:07.656
l love you, Michael.
l do.
Okay.

15:08.032 --> 15:10.701
But no. l mean it. No.

15:16.332 --> 15:19.167
l thought Nana raised
some good questions.

15:20.336 --> 15:22.379
What kind of a name
is Nana?

15:22.463 --> 15:24.339
lt means "grandmother."

15:24.507 --> 15:26.550
Oh, sweet Jesus.

15:28.136 --> 15:29.845
Look, l'm sorry
to do this,

15:29.929 --> 15:32.347
but can you drop me back
at the telemarketing building?

15:32.432 --> 15:34.391
You know, Michael,
if you want to succeed,

15:34.475 --> 15:36.977
you've got to
apply the same. . .

15:42.233 --> 15:44.067
DWlGHT: Get him, Jim !
Go, go!

15:44.152 --> 15:46.153
Come on, talk to me, Jim !

15:46.821 --> 15:48.739
Ah !
CHARLES: Oh, my God !

15:49.407 --> 15:50.991
Jim, what the. . .

15:51.075 --> 15:52.784
Phyllis, are you okay?
Are you okay?

15:52.869 --> 15:54.870
No, l swallowed a crown.

15:55.163 --> 15:57.456
Why'd you duck, Jim?
DWlGHT: Yeah, Jim.

15:57.540 --> 15:59.791
Why would an experienced
soccer player, like yourself,

15:59.876 --> 16:01.209
duck at the very
last moment?

16:01.294 --> 16:02.377
Okay, l'm just gonna go
get some ice.

16:02.462 --> 16:05.047
Does that make you
feel better, huh?

16:05.381 --> 16:06.798
l'm. . . l'm sorry, Phyllis.

16:06.883 --> 16:08.050
CHARLES: Oh, yeah,
Jim's sorry.

16:09.802 --> 16:11.970
Do you get TNT?
The station.
Do you get TNT?

16:12.055 --> 16:15.223
Yeah, l have cable
and satellite as a backup.

16:20.897 --> 16:23.982
Yeah, l know,
two not-so-great
things in a row.

16:25.068 --> 16:28.570
Yeah, well,
stuff happens, right?
At least we got Ryan.

16:29.238 --> 16:30.614
The Ry-guy.

16:31.366 --> 16:32.783
We should call him
Rye Bread.

16:32.867 --> 16:33.992
We don't have
to call him that.

16:34.077 --> 16:36.078
Unless you like it.
We could call him that.

16:36.162 --> 16:37.788
l can't do this.

16:37.872 --> 16:39.247
What's that?

16:39.874 --> 16:42.501
l can't do this.
l had a real job.

16:43.419 --> 16:45.921
l sat 1 0 feet away
from my fiance.

16:47.090 --> 16:48.965
l had health benefits.

16:49.217 --> 16:50.759
l was just feeling
impulsive.

16:50.843 --> 16:53.929
l should have gotten
a tiny tattoo on my ankle.

16:54.389 --> 16:58.016
l just keep getting bored,
and l let things build up
and build up,

16:58.101 --> 17:02.062
and then l do something
too big, like this.
Who does this?

17:02.146 --> 17:04.314
Well, you know what?
My mom always used to say

17:04.399 --> 17:08.235
that average people
are the most special
people in the world.

17:08.611 --> 17:09.653
And that's why
God made so many. . .

17:09.737 --> 17:11.196
We don't have any money.

17:11.280 --> 17:13.031
We don't have an office.
We don't have anything.

17:13.116 --> 17:14.491
Well, we should
make a list.

17:14.575 --> 17:17.744
Lists are good,
lists are good,
lists are good.

17:19.038 --> 17:22.374
First on the list,
let's get you out of
the car, all right?

17:22.458 --> 17:23.500
Okay.

17:23.584 --> 17:25.168
How come,
out of everyone
in the office,

17:25.253 --> 17:27.796
l'm the only one
who went with you?

17:27.880 --> 17:29.214
ls it because
l'm that stupid?

17:29.298 --> 17:32.843
l mean, your own grandmother
doesn't even believe in you.

17:37.640 --> 17:39.808
l want you
to listen to me.

17:41.102 --> 17:45.355
Because l want to tell you
the situation

17:45.440 --> 17:47.733
that we are both in
right now, okay?

17:49.402 --> 17:52.487
You quit your job,
l quit my job.
We both quit.

17:53.322 --> 17:55.741
Those are the facts.
That's what happened.

17:55.825 --> 17:57.951
Now, what are our
choices right now?

17:58.035 --> 18:00.245
Because, you know what,
kiddo? You quit.

18:01.831 --> 18:02.873
Yeah.

18:02.957 --> 18:05.333
So, what are
our options?
Well. . .

18:06.169 --> 18:09.087
We can start this
paper company.
We can try.

18:09.672 --> 18:13.633
Or. . . That's it,
that's our only option,
because we quit.

18:14.844 --> 18:19.598
Pam, l do my best work
when people don't
believe in me.

18:20.308 --> 18:22.392
l remember
in high school,

18:22.477 --> 18:24.853
my math teacher told me
l was going to flunk out.

18:24.937 --> 18:26.563
And know what l did?

18:26.647 --> 18:29.483
The very next day,
l went out and l
scored more goals

18:29.567 --> 18:32.569
than anyone
in the history
of the hockey team.

18:32.862 --> 18:36.072
See what l mean?
l thrive on this.
l thrive on it.

18:36.532 --> 18:38.074
So l'm going
to go inside,

18:38.159 --> 18:40.118
l'm going to make
some calls,

18:40.203 --> 18:41.578
l'm going to get us
an office space,

18:41.662 --> 18:45.665
and l'm going to show you
why you joined this company,
all right?

18:49.545 --> 18:50.962
(SNlFFLlNG)

18:51.881 --> 18:53.089
(SlGHS)

18:56.385 --> 18:58.929
You've gotta have some
extra space. Billy,
work with me here.

18:59.013 --> 19:04.142
There's got to be some
sort of secret office that
you have lurking around.

19:04.727 --> 19:08.688
Something awesome and free.
You keep it off the books.

19:10.107 --> 19:12.067
Oh, no. Not there.

19:12.860 --> 19:14.903
That would be humiliating.

19:15.029 --> 19:16.863
l did what l had to do.

19:16.948 --> 19:18.532
l stepped in,
l took charge.

19:18.783 --> 19:20.909
That's what
being a man is.

19:21.244 --> 19:23.995
And earlier today,
l was freaking out.

19:24.080 --> 19:26.289
Pam stepped up.
She was the man.

19:27.834 --> 19:29.793
Don't think a woman
can be a man?

19:29.877 --> 19:32.921
WeII, then that's your
stereotype, not mine.

19:34.215 --> 19:35.423
Okay.

19:42.431 --> 19:44.099
l could work here.

19:44.600 --> 19:46.101
l can see this.

19:46.227 --> 19:48.562
lt's right in the middle
of the paper belt.

19:48.646 --> 19:49.688
Are you good?

19:49.772 --> 19:51.982
Yeah, l'm good.
Are you good?

19:52.608 --> 19:53.900
l'm good.

20:02.535 --> 20:06.746
You know what they say.
Keep your friends close.

20:12.837 --> 20:15.463
Michael, you're back.

20:15.631 --> 20:17.299
Yes, l am, Charles.
Mmm-hmm.

20:17.383 --> 20:20.135
Except this time,
you've no legal right
to kick me out,

20:20.219 --> 20:22.304
because l have started
my very own paper company

20:22.388 --> 20:24.806
