00:03.560 --> 00:05.720
Signed up, Carter.

00:07.000 --> 00:13.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

02:12.360 --> 02:15.799
I heard you were looking for me.

02:15.800 --> 02:17.760
I want to buy a gun.

03:07.560 --> 03:09.000
Sid!

03:17.240 --> 03:19.520
That is wonderful news.

03:19.560 --> 03:22.400
Yeah. Who'd have thought it?
Me, a model prisoner?

03:23.840 --> 03:25.320
Erm...

03:25.360 --> 03:27.080
I think you know each other.

03:27.120 --> 03:30.080
Sid! When did you get out?

03:30.120 --> 03:32.120
Didn't I teach you anything?

03:32.160 --> 03:33.880
What?

03:33.920 --> 03:36.839
You're not going to get much power
out of a single carb, are you?

03:36.840 --> 03:39.840
Which is why I'm replacing
it with this.

03:39.880 --> 03:42.119
Nice! Do you want a hand?

03:42.120 --> 03:43.959
Why not?

03:43.960 --> 03:49.600
Sidney! Sidney Carter. It IS you.

03:51.280 --> 03:55.240
How...? Well, I mean, when...?

03:57.160 --> 03:59.440
First time I've seen you speechless,
Mrs M.

03:59.480 --> 04:02.920
Time off... for good behaviour.

04:02.960 --> 04:08.680
So it's over.
The whole horrible nightmare.

04:08.720 --> 04:10.359
It's really over.

04:10.360 --> 04:11.599
Yeah.

04:11.600 --> 04:15.000
Well, first things first,
let's get you fed.

04:15.040 --> 04:18.519
Now, I've just been trying out
a new recipe - coq au vin.

04:18.560 --> 04:20.039
Coq au what?

04:20.040 --> 04:23.760
Coq au vin, it's French.
It's got garlic in it.

04:25.600 --> 04:28.320
- This coq-what's-it's really good.
- Coq au vin!

04:29.480 --> 04:30.840
What do you think of it, Father?

04:30.880 --> 04:33.959
Striking Mediterranean flavours.

04:33.960 --> 04:35.240
Thank you.

04:35.280 --> 04:39.239
Well, we can't be eating boring old
shepherd's pie every day, can we?

04:39.240 --> 04:43.000
And I always think there is nothing
like the taste of the Continent.

04:43.040 --> 04:44.880
Nothing like it... at all.

04:46.440 --> 04:49.720
Miles better than what I've been
eating for the last year.

04:49.760 --> 04:51.240
I can only imagine.

04:51.280 --> 04:53.560
I expected you to be a bag of bones,

04:53.600 --> 04:56.440
but look at you with the big
beard and everything.

04:56.480 --> 04:59.919
There's not a lot to do inside other
than stare at walls

04:59.920 --> 05:01.479
and do push-ups.

05:01.480 --> 05:04.999
All the more reason you should've
allowed us to visit you.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.400
I'm sure Sid had his reasons.

05:07.440 --> 05:09.719
Sometimes you are too forgiving.

05:09.720 --> 05:13.880
It broke the Father's heart you
refusing to let see him see you.

05:13.920 --> 05:19.880
Well, the main thing is you're back
and things can get back to normal.

05:19.920 --> 05:22.440
Or what passes for normal in
Kembleford.

05:24.720 --> 05:28.159
I've drawn up a list of jobs for you
to do around the presbytery.

05:28.160 --> 05:31.640
Oh, yes, and you can help
me and Bunty in the garden.

05:33.040 --> 05:34.240
Yeah, sounds good...

05:38.000 --> 05:40.920
I've got to go. Sorry.

05:40.960 --> 05:43.040
Thanks for the food, Mrs M.

05:43.080 --> 05:45.000
It was good to see you again, Bunt.

05:45.040 --> 05:46.840
Father.

05:49.720 --> 05:52.520
He doesn't seem at all right to me.

05:53.960 --> 05:56.120
Perhaps he just needs time.

05:56.160 --> 05:59.680
Unless prison has changed him for
the worst.

06:01.480 --> 06:03.280
He kept looking at the clock.

06:07.800 --> 06:09.640
You're going to follow him?

06:11.320 --> 06:13.400
I'm just going for a nice bike ride.

06:13.440 --> 06:14.919
In his direction?

06:14.920 --> 06:16.400
Possibly.

06:36.800 --> 06:38.479
What are you doing with a gun?

06:38.480 --> 06:40.440
Sid?

06:40.480 --> 06:42.680
Just go, please.

06:42.720 --> 06:45.559
Not until you tell me what's going
on. Whose house is this?

06:45.560 --> 06:48.880
Edward Reese. Head of the
Judicial Appointments Commission.

06:48.920 --> 06:52.000
He's in there throwing a lovely
little shindig

06:52.040 --> 06:53.440
for his latest appointee.

06:55.080 --> 06:56.480
Giles Foster.

06:59.160 --> 07:00.840
Your defence barrister.

07:00.880 --> 07:03.760
My so-called defence barrister the
piece of sh...

07:05.480 --> 07:07.079
I'll take that, shall I?

07:07.080 --> 07:09.480
Unless you want
me to call the police?

07:09.520 --> 07:12.120
I thought you were on my side. I am.

07:27.400 --> 07:29.760
This way, gentlemen, please.

07:31.880 --> 07:33.639
Thank you.

07:33.640 --> 07:38.799
Thank you, everyone. And now I
sentence you all to fine champagne.

07:46.280 --> 07:48.480
I wanted to thank you for all of
this.

07:48.520 --> 07:50.959
It's above and beyond,
to say the least.

07:50.960 --> 07:53.360
On the contrary,
it's fully deserved.

07:53.400 --> 07:56.039
You're the finest young
lawyer I have ever met.

07:56.040 --> 07:57.960
The son you never had?

07:58.000 --> 07:59.519
Oh, don't be so sensitive.

07:59.520 --> 08:03.520
A little sensitivity wouldn't go
amiss in this family, would it, dear?

08:03.560 --> 08:05.999
What are you talking about, dear?
I have a heart of gold.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.239
I just choose not to mollycoddle,
that's all.

08:09.240 --> 08:10.840
Don't let him get to you.

08:10.880 --> 08:12.399
He's not getting to me, Mother.

08:12.400 --> 08:14.880
Lawyers are all the same.
Always playing dirty.

08:14.920 --> 08:16.320
Indeed.

08:16.360 --> 08:21.000
Consider yourself fortunate you
dropped out of law school.

08:26.600 --> 08:28.720
I think I'll get myself a drink.

08:36.240 --> 08:39.159
What are you doing here?

08:39.200 --> 08:41.679
So you remember me.

08:41.720 --> 08:43.280
I'm touched, Your Honour(!)

08:45.600 --> 08:49.440
Father Brown. I'm here to mediate.

08:51.680 --> 08:55.439
And perhaps we should go
somewhere less public.

08:55.440 --> 08:57.239
There's nothing to mediate.

08:57.240 --> 08:59.560
What about the matter of
a certain witness statement?

08:59.600 --> 09:01.239
What are you talking about?

09:01.240 --> 09:03.840
I got hold of my case files
while I was inside.

09:03.910 --> 09:04.933
And?

09:04.958 --> 09:08.080
Patient next to
Judith Miles... you remember.

09:08.120 --> 09:10.119
The woman I allegedly beat up?

09:10.120 --> 09:12.640
Said he saw
a man visit her in the ward.

09:12.680 --> 09:14.840
Panama hat, scar on his face.

09:14.880 --> 09:17.720
After he left,
she accused me of the assault.

09:19.040 --> 09:20.640
You didn't think that was relevant?

09:22.120 --> 09:24.760
If something like that had been
bought to my attention,

09:24.800 --> 09:26.880
I would have presented it in court.

09:26.920 --> 09:29.879
If it does exist, then give it to
me and I'll take it to the...

09:29.880 --> 09:33.280
You really think I'm going to trust
you with it? A corrupt lawyer?

09:33.320 --> 09:35.079
I've heard enough of this.

09:35.080 --> 09:37.040
You do NOT walk away from me.

09:37.080 --> 09:38.599
What's going on?

09:38.600 --> 09:40.840
Gate-crashers.

09:42.800 --> 09:45.920
Off my property,
or I'll call the police.

09:47.360 --> 09:49.080
Sidney, we're leaving.

10:06.040 --> 10:07.400
Give me the gun.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.560
And what do you intend to do with
it?

10:09.600 --> 10:12.480
Just want to get him alone,
make him talk.

10:12.520 --> 10:15.320
And if he doesn't,
then what? Shoot him?

10:15.360 --> 10:18.120
That man stole a year of my life.

10:18.160 --> 10:21.880
Then you should take that witness
statement to the proper authorities.

10:23.840 --> 10:27.640
Proper authorities(?)
What have they ever done for me?

10:27.680 --> 10:31.679
When you were arrested I did
everything I could to solve

10:31.680 --> 10:33.200
this case.

10:33.240 --> 10:36.040
I never stopped
thinking about it.

10:36.080 --> 10:39.880
And that woman never
changed her story.

10:41.560 --> 10:43.560
I'm going to handle this myself.

10:45.662 --> 10:46.701
Sid!

11:02.945 --> 11:03.983
Sid.

11:09.680 --> 11:11.680
Oh, my goodness!

11:23.840 --> 11:27.919
Right, let's get that champagne
glass dusted for fingerprints.

11:27.920 --> 11:29.960
What are you doing here, Padre?

11:34.200 --> 11:36.200
Just happened to be passing.

11:36.240 --> 11:37.759
Of course you were(!)

11:37.760 --> 11:41.240
Giles Foster, sir. Defence
barrister, newly appointed judge.

11:41.280 --> 11:44.320
No doubt I'll have a list of
suspects as long as my arm.

11:44.360 --> 11:46.560
I'll save you time there, Inspector.
I saw who did it.

11:46.600 --> 11:49.160
It was his friend.

11:49.200 --> 11:50.800
Who's he talking about?

11:53.080 --> 11:55.359
Sid didn't do this.

11:55.360 --> 11:57.320
Are you calling my son a liar?

11:57.360 --> 12:00.360
He was threatening Giles moments
before this happened.

12:00.400 --> 12:01.600
Is this true?

12:01.640 --> 12:03.919
Well, he was angry, yes, but...

12:03.920 --> 12:05.640
What exactly did you see?

12:05.680 --> 12:08.880
He walked right up to him and stuck
the glass in his throat.

12:08.920 --> 12:11.320
He didn't give the poor fellow
a chance.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
Get him!

12:19.674 --> 12:22.486
Sid Carter, I am arresting you for
the murder of Giles Foster.

12:22.526 --> 12:23.219
I didn't do it!

12:23.244 --> 12:25.338
You are not obliged...
Where's the witness statement?

12:25.363 --> 12:28.000
It's under my bed, in the money box.
I did not do it, Father.

12:28.040 --> 12:29.840
...given in evidence.

12:35.142 --> 12:38.222
Oh, Father you're back. Now...

12:40.680 --> 12:43.240
What on earth are you doing with
that?

12:44.280 --> 12:46.319
Sid's been arrested for murder.

12:46.320 --> 12:50.320
Oh, sweet Jesus. Penelope was right.

12:50.360 --> 12:51.799
Prison must have changed him.

12:51.800 --> 12:53.319
He didn't do it.

12:53.320 --> 12:57.240
His caravan was ransacked and
a witness statement

12:57.280 --> 13:00.719
has been stolen that his
defence barrister hid.

13:00.720 --> 13:02.720
Is that the murder weapon?

13:02.760 --> 13:04.399
No.

13:04.400 --> 13:05.799
Well, then...? It's Sid's.

13:05.800 --> 13:08.680
I know you care about him.
And I do, too,

13:08.720 --> 13:12.280
but you really have to at least
consider the possibility.

13:12.320 --> 13:14.720
I will not let him down again.

13:33.040 --> 13:35.040
How can I...?

13:39.560 --> 13:41.359
What are you doing here?

13:41.360 --> 13:42.959
I just want to talk.

13:42.960 --> 13:44.760
I already told you everything.

13:46.440 --> 13:48.840
But you didn't tell
me about the man with the scar.

13:50.280 --> 13:51.920
And you know who I mean.

13:53.560 --> 13:55.559
I've got no idea.

13:55.560 --> 13:59.160
The man who visited you in hospital
after you'd been attacked.

14:01.480 --> 14:05.119
Wills and probate. Yes,
we can handle that for you, Father.

14:05.120 --> 14:07.800
I'll have to check
Mr Chandler's schedule...

14:10.200 --> 14:15.120
I've put that life behind me.
Please don't drag it up.

14:16.400 --> 14:20.320
I'm sorry, but I have no choice.

14:20.360 --> 14:21.640
I need to know the truth.

14:23.200 --> 14:24.200
I told you.

14:25.360 --> 14:28.000
Sid Carter accosted me in an alley.

14:30.520 --> 14:34.200
He said he found you,
bruised and bleeding,

14:34.240 --> 14:36.320
and called for help. You owe him.

14:39.160 --> 14:40.719
What about what I'm owed?

14:40.720 --> 14:42.200
What do you mean?

14:42.240 --> 14:44.240
The years I was doing that for
a living.

14:44.280 --> 14:45.800
You think that was by choice?

14:48.000 --> 14:49.800
My childhood dream?

14:51.880 --> 14:53.440
Childhood.

14:54.680 --> 14:57.880
That wasn't the first
a customer to get rough, believe me.

14:59.600 --> 15:01.519
I can't imagine what you've
been through.

15:01.520 --> 15:02.680
That's right.

15:03.840 --> 15:05.360
The pain you've suffered.

15:06.760 --> 15:10.960
And I'd probably would think
I was owed, too.

15:12.560 --> 15:18.000
And if somebody offered me a way
out, I'd probably take it.

15:19.680 --> 15:22.040
Especially if I had a child.

15:24.400 --> 15:26.560
She is beautiful.

15:30.640 --> 15:32.560
(She's everything to me.)

15:35.600 --> 15:37.080
That's why I can't help you.

15:38.880 --> 15:40.720
I'm sorry, Father.

15:41.720 --> 15:43.400
My life's better now.

15:43.440 --> 15:45.920
Like I never thought it could be.

15:47.120 --> 15:48.480
Because someone helped you.

15:48.520 --> 15:49.520
Please!

15:51.240 --> 15:53.239
Don't take all this
away from me.

15:53.240 --> 15:55.360
I'm not trying to take anything.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.919
But Sid is being held for
a murder he didn't commit

15:59.920 --> 16:04.080
and I believe that it is connected
to what happened to you.

16:04.120 --> 16:05.640
Only, this time...

16:06.800 --> 16:08.160
..he could hang.

16:14.120 --> 16:15.920
I'm sorry, Father.

16:45.760 --> 16:51.680
It's me. You told me to telephone if
anyone started asking questions.

17:16.680 --> 17:18.079
What are you doing?

17:20.119 --> 17:22.759
I wondered if I might have a word
with your son.

17:22.760 --> 17:24.040
Why?

17:24.079 --> 17:26.880
I'd like to know exactly what
he saw.

17:26.920 --> 17:28.999
I think he made that
perfectly clear.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.359
I've known Sid Carter since
he was a child.

17:31.360 --> 17:35.000
And you can't bear the thought that
he's done something so despicable.

17:35.040 --> 17:37.199
I believe he's innocent.

17:37.200 --> 17:41.200
Which implies you think my son's
a liar. Perhaps even the killer.

17:41.240 --> 17:44.240
I'm not making accusations.

17:44.280 --> 17:46.520
But you're coming awfully close.

17:49.960 --> 17:52.719
Did you notice
a stranger at your luncheon?

17:52.720 --> 17:54.640
Stranger?

17:54.680 --> 17:56.640
A man with a scar.

17:56.680 --> 17:58.240
Perhaps a Panama hat.

18:00.120 --> 18:01.720
My God, yes.

18:03.160 --> 18:05.640
I don't know why I didn't
think of it before.

18:05.680 --> 18:08.680
He had an evil glint in his eye and
a hook for a hand(!)

18:08.720 --> 18:11.519
I don't think this is funny.

18:11.520 --> 18:15.159
Father, I know what it's like to
feel let down by your nearest

18:15.160 --> 18:16.960
and dearest.

18:18.360 --> 18:22.880
My son's hardly a model citizen,
but he's not a killer.

18:25.320 --> 18:28.120
You're biased and it's
clouding your judgment.

18:28.160 --> 18:33.559
And the same equally could
be said of you.

18:33.560 --> 18:37.440
Which is why I'd be unfit to
evaluate the evidence in this case.

18:37.480 --> 18:39.480
I have to leave that to others.

18:40.560 --> 18:41.960
As do you.

18:55.000 --> 18:58.439
Can you clear away the breakfast
things?

18:58.440 --> 19:01.679
Well, how am I supposed to do that?

19:01.680 --> 19:05.680
You put the jam in the cupboard and
you put the dirty dishes in

19:05.720 --> 19:07.160
the sink.

19:15.320 --> 19:18.880
Well, that's not going to
prejudice the jury, is it(?)

19:18.920 --> 19:23.000
Well, let's hope it won't
come to that.

19:24.040 --> 19:25.160
Well?

19:26.880 --> 19:31.400
The hospital administrator said that
the witness who saw the man

19:31.440 --> 19:34.199
with the scar has passed away.

19:34.200 --> 19:35.760
Murdered?

19:35.800 --> 19:38.599
No. Terminal illness.

19:38.600 --> 19:42.360
Well, surely someone else
must've seen him.

19:42.400 --> 19:44.000
Apparently not.

19:44.040 --> 19:45.920
So, what now?

19:45.960 --> 19:48.039
I'm going to visit Sid.

19:48.040 --> 19:53.879
And on the way I'm going to give his
caravan a proper search.

19:53.880 --> 19:56.039
Well, I'll give you a lift.

19:56.040 --> 19:58.920
And I'll come, too.
An extra pair of eyes.

20:00.600 --> 20:03.680
Thank you... both.

20:06.280 --> 20:09.480
And please drive
at a civilised speed.

20:09.520 --> 20:11.680
Always, Mrs M.

20:31.040 --> 20:33.880
What are we looking for?

20:33.920 --> 20:35.480
I wish I knew.

20:40.200 --> 20:45.040
Well, what that boy needs
is the hand of a good woman.

20:45.080 --> 20:46.840
Couldn't agree more.

21:19.800 --> 21:21.680
You two go back to the presbytery.

21:21.720 --> 21:23.640
I'll go to the police station.

21:23.680 --> 21:25.680
Are you sure?

21:27.040 --> 21:30.520
Tell Sidney that we're all
thinking of him.

22:03.800 --> 22:06.919
Just like they said, sir.
Brake lines have been cut.

22:06.920 --> 22:09.559
Which mean someone was
trying to kill us.

22:09.560 --> 22:12.159
I think I was the intended victim.

22:12.160 --> 22:13.600
We were the collateral damage.

22:13.640 --> 22:16.040
Why would anybody want to kill you,
Padre?

22:16.080 --> 22:18.680
No, don't answer that.
Part of me sympathises.

22:18.720 --> 22:19.799
Have you no respect?

22:19.800 --> 22:21.320
Yes, all right.

22:21.360 --> 22:24.839
I suppose you think it was the man
with the scar and the Panama hat?

22:24.840 --> 22:26.400
Possibly.

22:26.440 --> 22:30.279
I found this in Sid's caravan.

22:30.280 --> 22:32.160
Not really his style.

22:34.160 --> 22:37.000
Is that all you've got? A button?

22:39.000 --> 22:41.040
I spoke to Judith Miles.

22:41.080 --> 22:42.480
Who?

22:42.520 --> 22:45.280
The young woman Sid was
convicted of assaulting, sir.

22:45.320 --> 22:48.120
I asked her about the man
with the scar.

22:48.160 --> 22:51.079
And she knew
what I was talking about.

22:51.080 --> 22:53.640
So why isn't she down here making
a statement?

22:53.680 --> 22:58.319
Because she's scared.
She has a lot to lose.

22:58.320 --> 23:00.480
You're wasting your time, Padre.

23:02.200 --> 23:04.800
I want to see Sid now.

23:12.920 --> 23:13.920
Father.

23:21.160 --> 23:22.720
Five minutes, Father.

23:25.080 --> 23:26.480
Thank you, Sgt Goodfellow.

23:28.400 --> 23:30.239
You took your time.

23:30.240 --> 23:31.920
Bunty and Mrs McCarthy
send their love.

23:31.960 --> 23:33.800
Did you get the witness statement?

23:35.480 --> 23:36.720
It was stolen.

23:36.760 --> 23:38.560
By who?

23:40.200 --> 23:44.359
I take it that this doesn't
belong to you?

23:44.360 --> 23:46.919
What do you think I am? A dandy?

23:46.920 --> 23:48.440
Prison didn't change me that much.

23:49.720 --> 23:52.279
Then I think we can assume it
belongs to the man

23:52.280 --> 23:54.320
in the Panama hat.

23:59.920 --> 24:01.880
So he did it all along? Mm?

24:01.920 --> 24:04.520
He beat up Judith Miles and
he killed Giles Foster.

24:04.560 --> 24:08.199
No. no.
They were crimes of impulse.

24:08.200 --> 24:11.040
He's controlled and calculated.

24:12.320 --> 24:15.160
So he's working for someone else?
Yes, I presume so.

24:17.360 --> 24:20.760
Then it has to be Edward Reese,
or his son.

24:23.720 --> 24:26.479
But we don't have enough evidence.

24:26.480 --> 24:27.720
Well, what have you got so far?

24:31.960 --> 24:33.760
Father...

24:33.800 --> 24:36.839
Tell me you've got something.

24:36.840 --> 24:38.840
Not enough.

24:38.880 --> 24:41.440
They're going to charge me!

24:41.480 --> 24:43.120
Yes, I know.

24:45.200 --> 24:46.560
I need to hire someone.

24:47.920 --> 24:49.559
What do you mean?

24:49.560 --> 24:51.440
To beat it out of them.

24:51.480 --> 24:52.599
I hope you're not serious.

24:52.600 --> 24:55.680
Do you know what, Father? Sometimes
violence is the only answer.

24:55.720 --> 24:59.360
If there's one thing I have ever
taught you,

24:59.400 --> 25:04.320
I hope, is that violence is never
the answer.

25:04.360 --> 25:06.279
Huh!

25:06.280 --> 25:08.920
Yes, but I don't live in your
ivory tower, do I?

25:10.480 --> 25:14.280
This is where I live now and unless
you get me out of here,

25:14.320 --> 25:16.840
this is where I'm going to live
for the rest of my life.

25:16.880 --> 25:18.840
Until they hang me, of course.

25:18.880 --> 25:20.440
And if I DO get you out...

25:21.720 --> 25:23.080
..what are you going to do?

25:24.800 --> 25:27.680
Beat it out of Edward Reese
yourself?

25:27.720 --> 25:29.120
You're supposed to be helping me!

25:29.160 --> 25:30.519
I AM helping you.

25:30.520 --> 25:32.280
By leaving me in here to rot?!

25:33.920 --> 25:35.000
You can go now, Father.

25:55.040 --> 25:57.040
Ah. Tea's up.

25:59.520 --> 26:00.520
Father?

26:06.600 --> 26:09.720
Father? Are you all right?

26:11.720 --> 26:13.919
Am I beaten, Mrs McCarthy?

26:13.920 --> 26:15.720
Whatever do you mean?

26:16.880 --> 26:19.159
Is this the mystery I'll
never solve?

26:19.160 --> 26:21.439
Is Sid the one I'll never save?

26:21.440 --> 26:24.880
Stop that talk.
You'll find something.

26:24.920 --> 26:26.480
You always do.

26:31.160 --> 26:34.519
There's nothing we can't solve over
tea and strawberry scones, Father.

26:34.520 --> 26:36.040
Award-winning strawberry scones.

26:36.080 --> 26:37.480
Of course.

26:37.520 --> 26:42.560
Now, I have been thinking about the
case and I know what we need to do.

26:43.800 --> 26:45.959
Yes, Mrs McCarthy?

26:45.960 --> 26:48.560
We need to track down the man
with the Panama hat.

26:48.600 --> 26:49.879
Agreed.

26:49.880 --> 26:52.519
So I am going to visit
some hat shops.

26:52.520 --> 26:53.959
Hat shops?

26:53.960 --> 26:56.360
Well, he had to buy it from
somewhere, didn't he?

26:56.400 --> 26:58.319
Lateral thinking, I like it.

26:58.320 --> 27:01.119
I suspect that we won't need to
track him down.

27:01.120 --> 27:03.159
What do you...? What do you mean?

27:03.160 --> 27:05.320
I'm going to ask you both
to go home.

27:07.680 --> 27:11.960
If... if I'm a target, then...

27:12.000 --> 27:13.119
Don't you worry about us.

27:13.120 --> 27:17.519
We're staying right here.
Now would you please eat up?

27:17.520 --> 27:21.119
I'm afraid I will not take
no for an answer.

27:22.560 --> 27:23.760
Oh! Holy Mother!

27:23.800 --> 27:25.240
Get down!

27:28.480 --> 27:30.040
We need a gun.

27:30.080 --> 27:33.440
We have one.
There's one in the Father's desk.

27:33.480 --> 27:34.960
Bunty, no!

27:52.880 --> 27:53.880
Police!

28:14.160 --> 28:16.319
Stay down, Father!

28:16.320 --> 28:19.120
It's me he's after. Not you.

28:25.640 --> 28:27.160
I found your button.

28:27.200 --> 28:28.760
What?

28:28.800 --> 28:30.720
You're improperly dressed, soldier.

28:32.880 --> 28:35.800
Perhaps you should sew it on
before you kill me.

28:38.360 --> 28:39.960
Drop it!

28:44.240 --> 28:46.599
You're under arrest for
attempted murder.

28:46.600 --> 28:49.279
You're not obliged to say anything
unless you wish to do so,

28:49.280 --> 28:52.160
and what you say will be taken down
and may be given in evidence.

29:02.840 --> 29:05.200
I'll leave that in your
capable hands.

29:14.760 --> 29:16.160
Are you all right?

29:17.760 --> 29:19.720
Don't you ever do that to me again.

29:29.840 --> 29:31.520
He won't say a word.

29:31.560 --> 29:33.600
May I speak to him?

29:33.640 --> 29:36.000
It's like talking to
a loaf of bread, Padre.

29:36.040 --> 29:38.119
If you ask me, he's not all there.

29:39.320 --> 29:41.119
Kembleford Police.

29:41.120 --> 29:43.200
But we found this in his car,

29:43.240 --> 29:45.919
which suggests...

29:45.920 --> 29:48.080
That he's a paid assassin.

29:48.120 --> 29:49.240
OK.

29:49.280 --> 29:51.440
What have you got
yourself mixed up in?

29:51.480 --> 29:54.800
And more to the point,
what have you got ME mixed up in?

29:55.960 --> 29:59.360
Have you got any evidence linking
him to Edward Reese?

29:59.400 --> 30:02.840
The car was spotless.
No identification, nothing.

30:02.880 --> 30:05.119
It's like he doesn't even exist.

30:05.120 --> 30:06.880
All right, thank you.

30:06.920 --> 30:10.159
They can't get a conclusive result
on the champagne glass.

30:10.160 --> 30:12.199
The blood's obscuring
the fingerprints.

30:12.200 --> 30:15.040
I'd say without that we don't have
enough evidence to charge

30:15.080 --> 30:17.079
Sid Carter.

30:17.080 --> 30:18.719
Are you telling me my job?

30:18.720 --> 30:20.480
No, sir, Sorry, sir.

30:20.520 --> 30:22.959
May I take custody of him?

30:22.960 --> 30:25.160
You really believe he's innocent?

30:25.200 --> 30:26.600
I do.

30:26.640 --> 30:29.679
Even if you're right,
you've seen what he's become.

30:29.680 --> 30:31.880
You think you can trust him now,
Padre?

30:31.920 --> 30:33.440
I have faith in him.

30:36.800 --> 30:38.440
Keys.

30:49.000 --> 30:53.879
The killer used your champagne glass
to kill Giles Foster,

30:53.880 --> 30:56.240
in order to incriminate you.

30:56.280 --> 30:58.680
But there were no other fingerprints
on the glass.

31:00.440 --> 31:03.560
I think that the ashes I saw in the
bucket outside the house

31:03.600 --> 31:07.840
were the remnants of the killer's
blood-stained gloves.

31:07.880 --> 31:11.680
But why not just kill Sid?
Why kill his barrister?

31:11.720 --> 31:15.120
The only explanation that makes
sense is that they wanted to

31:15.160 --> 31:18.599
silence Giles Foster,
and implicate you.

31:18.600 --> 31:20.200
Two birds with one stone.

31:20.240 --> 31:22.119
Exactly.

31:22.120 --> 31:25.919
This isn't getting us anywhere. We
just need to confront Edward Reese.

31:25.920 --> 31:30.360
We can't just stroll into his house
with wild accusations.

31:30.400 --> 31:32.679
Well, who else has the money to
hire an assassin?

31:32.680 --> 31:35.079
That is conjecture, not evidence.

31:35.080 --> 31:36.279
So you're a lawyer now?

31:36.280 --> 31:38.919
Don't you speak to the
Father like that.

31:38.920 --> 31:40.280
Sorry.

31:41.800 --> 31:43.400
It's just been a year.

31:43.440 --> 31:46.639
I've had this hanging
around my neck for a year.

31:46.640 --> 31:48.680
I want justice.

31:49.920 --> 31:53.120
Justice... or revenge?

31:57.920 --> 32:01.560
Mrs McCarthy... may I?

32:02.920 --> 32:04.719
Is this acetate?

32:04.720 --> 32:06.720
It most certainly is.

32:08.360 --> 32:09.999
Is it a favourite?

32:10.000 --> 32:13.320
No. Well, not particularly. Why?

32:14.680 --> 32:16.480
May I have it?

32:17.720 --> 32:21.600
I'm not sure it would suit
you, Father.

32:28.280 --> 32:30.800
What do you think you're doing?

32:30.840 --> 32:33.120
Well, it's hardly haute couture.

32:33.160 --> 32:36.800
Just because I didn't pay £20 for it
in Swan & Edgar doesn't mean

32:36.840 --> 32:39.240
it wasn't a very nice scarf.

32:42.520 --> 32:44.520
Brittle, black beads.

32:46.080 --> 32:48.399
Just like the material I found in
the bucket

32:48.400 --> 32:50.000
outside the Reeses' house.

32:50.040 --> 32:51.400
Meaning what?

32:52.680 --> 32:54.280
Lydia Reese.

32:54.320 --> 33:00.440
At the reception she was wearing a
scarf. After the murder, she wasn't.

33:04.640 --> 33:06.080
Sid!

33:10.560 --> 33:12.960
Sid, what are you doing?

33:15.480 --> 33:17.600
What I should have done
from the start.

33:27.800 --> 33:29.239
Sid!

33:29.240 --> 33:31.640
Those brakes!

33:31.680 --> 33:33.560
The brakes!

33:33.600 --> 33:35.039
I had them fixed.

33:35.040 --> 33:38.080
Thank God for that.
He must be going to the house.

33:38.120 --> 33:40.160
We have to call the police.

33:40.200 --> 33:42.239
Not yet. I'll talk to him.

33:42.240 --> 33:46.280
For once Penelope is right.
I hate to say it, but she is.

33:47.320 --> 33:50.360
And I don't want you in any more
danger.

33:50.400 --> 33:51.960
Don't worry about me.

33:52.000 --> 33:53.680
Father...

33:53.720 --> 33:56.200
the simple truth is, we have lost
him.

33:58.280 --> 34:00.080
I'll get him back.

34:23.080 --> 34:24.679
Surprise.

34:26.360 --> 34:29.159
Edward!

34:32.280 --> 34:34.639
I think it's about time we had
a little chat.

34:36.600 --> 34:38.760
What do you want?

34:40.440 --> 34:41.958
The truth.

34:41.960 --> 34:45.800
You won't get that by waving
a gun at us.

34:45.840 --> 34:46.840
I disagree.

34:48.960 --> 34:51.040
You killed Giles Foster.

34:51.080 --> 34:52.480
Are you mad?

34:53.560 --> 34:54.600
And you knew about it.

34:54.639 --> 34:56.998
What do you hope to gain?

34:57.000 --> 35:00.759
Nothing we say will be admissible in
court if it's coerced from us

35:00.760 --> 35:02.440
at gunpoint.

35:02.480 --> 35:05.080
I told you what I want. The truth.

35:05.120 --> 35:08.079
You haven't got the guts to
pull the trigger.

35:08.080 --> 35:09.359
You're a joke.

35:10.800 --> 35:13.039
Randolph, no.

35:16.800 --> 35:18.080
Start talking.

35:18.120 --> 35:21.079
Yes, I killed him. Why?

35:21.080 --> 35:22.320
To protect my son.

35:25.200 --> 35:26.800
You beat up Judith Miles.

35:26.840 --> 35:28.519
You mean that whore?

35:28.520 --> 35:30.680
Don't antagonise him,
for God's sake.

35:30.720 --> 35:32.320
And you knew about it.

35:32.360 --> 35:35.560
So you bribed my barrister to bury
the witness statement.

35:37.440 --> 35:40.039
What was he going to do? Expose you?

35:40.040 --> 35:42.040
It was a risk I couldn't take.

35:48.160 --> 35:49.799
What do you suggest we do?

35:49.800 --> 35:51.600
Leave it with me.

35:51.640 --> 35:53.840
But if he has the witness
statement...

35:53.880 --> 35:56.280
As I said, I'll take care of that.

35:56.320 --> 35:58.959
I should never have listened to you.

35:58.960 --> 36:02.199
You're where you are now because of
me. Don't forget that.

36:02.200 --> 36:04.879
Exactly. This is all because of you.

36:04.880 --> 36:06.440
Meaning what?

36:08.600 --> 36:11.320
I've given you a bright future.

36:12.640 --> 36:15.440
I can take it away just as easily.

36:23.520 --> 36:25.560
Everything's going to be all right.

36:28.800 --> 36:33.879
I'm sorry, Mrs Reese.
I have to tell the truth.

36:33.880 --> 36:37.800
You're sure? I am.

36:40.040 --> 36:41.040
I understand.

36:49.720 --> 36:52.399
You've got what you wanted.
The truth.

36:52.400 --> 36:54.160
Now go.

36:55.840 --> 36:57.639
What about the man with the scar?

36:57.640 --> 37:01.480
He works for me, yes, amongst other
prominent members of society.

37:01.520 --> 37:04.879
He is what I believe you call
a fixer.

37:04.880 --> 37:06.239
Fixed you up well, didn't he?

37:06.240 --> 37:07.960
So we're all in on it together.

37:08.000 --> 37:12.040
What are you going to do?
Shoot us all?

37:13.320 --> 37:15.519
Whatever you decide,
you're doomed to failure.

37:15.520 --> 37:18.240
The only certainty is that you'll be
going back to prison where

37:18.280 --> 37:19.600
you belong.

37:19.640 --> 37:23.239
Yeah, well, maybe before I go,
I should put you where you belong.

37:23.240 --> 37:24.640
Sid...

37:29.760 --> 37:31.120
Put down the gun.

37:32.960 --> 37:34.800
You are not a killer.

37:38.160 --> 37:39.520
They took a year of my life.

37:40.880 --> 37:42.720
You have the rest of your life left.

37:44.560 --> 37:47.200
Sid, you are the closest thing I
have ever had...

37:52.120 --> 37:53.280
..to a son.

37:56.120 --> 37:57.320
Please.

38:06.080 --> 38:08.639
Lydia, Lydia, no.

38:08.640 --> 38:11.120
I told you, nothing we have said
will be admissible.

38:11.160 --> 38:15.639
I'm not going to take that chance.
Do it, Mother.

38:15.640 --> 38:16.919
We'll say they broke in.

38:16.944 --> 38:18.428
We struggled for the gun. It went
off.

38:18.453 --> 38:19.965
You're not thinking
rationally.

38:19.990 --> 38:21.714
I have just confessed to murder and
Randolph to assault.

38:21.739 --> 38:23.403
What choice do we have?

38:24.280 --> 38:26.160
Go ahead, pull the trigger.

38:38.520 --> 38:40.679
They broke in. I managed to...

38:40.680 --> 38:43.279
Don't waste your breath, Madam.
We heard everything.

38:43.280 --> 38:45.040
No...

38:45.080 --> 38:46.319
Mother...

38:46.320 --> 38:51.399
Let me hold him. Please, let me hold
him. One last time. Please....

38:51.400 --> 38:55.159
Lydia Reese, you're under arrest for
the murder of Giles Foster.

38:55.160 --> 38:58.480
You are not obliged to say anything
unless you wish to do so,

38:58.520 --> 39:01.320
but what you say will be written
down and may be given in evidence.

39:50.920 --> 39:52.520
Sid...

39:52.560 --> 39:55.480
Oh! Just in time for tea
and sandwiches.

39:55.520 --> 39:56.960
I'll get you a cup.

39:57.000 --> 39:59.600
And scones. I'm not staying.

39:59.640 --> 40:01.079
Going away?

40:01.080 --> 40:03.280
For a while.

40:03.320 --> 40:05.720
But you've just been away for
a whole year.

40:07.480 --> 40:10.400
I want to travel. See the world.

40:10.440 --> 40:13.080
See the world?
How are you going to afford that?

40:13.120 --> 40:16.199
Well, I'll get by. Odd jobs,
handyman work.

40:16.200 --> 40:18.160
Might even visit Lady F.

40:18.200 --> 40:19.559
Drive her round Rhodesia.

40:19.560 --> 40:21.360
Drive her round the bend, more like.

40:21.400 --> 40:23.000
For how long?

40:24.440 --> 40:25.800
I don't know.

40:27.000 --> 40:31.800
This might sound silly,
but I want to have some adventures.

40:33.840 --> 40:38.039
Don't you have enough
adventures here?

40:38.040 --> 40:41.880
Listen, I don't want a long goodbye
so...

40:41.920 --> 40:45.280
Cos I know I'll just
change my mind, so...

40:45.320 --> 40:46.959
I'm leaving now.

40:46.960 --> 40:48.360
What, right now?

40:48.400 --> 40:51.000
Not before I have packed you a
lunch.

40:59.360 --> 41:01.360
I'll come back.

41:01.400 --> 41:04.000
Well, send us lots of postcards.

41:04.040 --> 41:06.040
And if you ever need
a partner-in-crime,

41:06.080 --> 41:08.080
you know where to find me.

41:10.280 --> 41:15.880
Now, there's some sandwiches and
my scones.

41:15.920 --> 41:19.840
Oh, Sidney, you come back to us,
now.

41:19.880 --> 41:23.080
Do you hear me? You come back.

41:25.400 --> 41:28.279
Are you sure you're not going to
stay for some tea?

41:28.280 --> 41:30.680
I've got a train to catch.

41:32.480 --> 41:34.200
We could take you to the station.

41:34.240 --> 41:36.679
Please, Father, do not
make this harder.

41:36.680 --> 41:38.320
All right.

41:38.360 --> 41:42.680
Before I go... I've got
a confession to make.

41:44.400 --> 41:49.239
The watch that you bought me for my
21st birthday...

41:49.240 --> 41:51.120
I sold it to buy the gun.

41:52.560 --> 41:54.360
I'm sorry.

41:54.400 --> 41:58.000
You weren't in your right mind and
you are forgiven.

42:08.440 --> 42:10.200
You saved my life, Father.
