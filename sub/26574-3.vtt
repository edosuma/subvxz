00:04.671 --> 00:06.506
Olivia Richmond had everything.

00:06.506 --> 00:09.051
<i>Perfect smile, perfect friends.</i>

00:09.051 --> 00:11.053
<i>But it all disappeared</i>
<i>in an instant that night.</i>

00:11.053 --> 00:13.013
[Violet] Olivia, wait.
Where are you going?

00:13.013 --> 00:14.431
[Olivia]
<i>Anywhere but here.</i>

00:14.431 --> 00:16.141
[Deb] Say your goodbyes.
We’re going.

00:16.141 --> 00:17.684
Mom, you are humiliating me.

00:17.684 --> 00:18.810
Maybe you deserve it.

00:18.810 --> 00:21.021
‐[horn honking]
‐Aaah!

[Olivia]
<i>Severed arm on the freeway.</i>

00:29.321 --> 00:31.448
‐Pretty twisted.
‐[Violet] Thanks.

00:31.448 --> 00:32.741
So who wants to go next?

00:34.201 --> 00:37.287
Candace Preston loved
family, friends,

00:37.287 --> 00:40.666
flea markets, scary movies.

00:40.666 --> 00:44.586
Really, there was only one thing
that Candace never liked.

00:44.586 --> 00:49.174
Ever since she was little,
she hated the ocean.

00:49.174 --> 00:52.928
<i>The brine, the waves,</i>
<i>the murkiness,</i>

00:52.928 --> 00:56.390
<i>the foreboding sense</i>
<i>that once you go under,</i>

00:56.390 --> 00:59.351
<i>you might never find your way</i>
<i>back to the surface.</i>

00:59.351 --> 01:01.019
<i>‐And then one day...</i>
‐[Candace screams]

01:01.019 --> 01:02.562
<i>...she went under.</i>

01:02.562 --> 01:05.691
<i>No one saw the panic,</i>
<i>the flailing.</i>

01:05.691 --> 01:08.986
<i>Flailing is a very bad idea,</i>
<i>by the way,</i>

01:08.986 --> 01:11.196
since it uses up
all your oxygen and,

01:11.196 --> 01:13.365
after that, runs out. Well...

01:14.741 --> 01:16.910
<i>No one heard her screams.</i>

01:16.910 --> 01:18.620
‐[muffled scream]
<i>‐The water flooded</i>
<i>into her lungs,</i>

01:18.620 --> 01:20.831
<i>throat spasmed,</i>

01:20.831 --> 01:22.791
and right when her heart
gave out,

01:22.791 --> 01:25.544
Candace’s very last thought was,

01:25.544 --> 01:27.921
<i>"I never</i>
<i>should have gone anywhere</i>

01:27.921 --> 01:30.257
<i>near that deep, blue ocean."</i>

01:30.257 --> 01:33.135
[church bell tolling]

01:33.135 --> 01:34.428
[Alex]
We should head in.

01:34.428 --> 01:37.806
This is really happening.

01:37.806 --> 01:38.682
I know.

01:39.891 --> 01:42.352
She knew I hated the ocean.

01:42.352 --> 01:44.771
[Alex] What? Who?

01:44.771 --> 01:46.356
Violet.

01:46.356 --> 01:49.192
Halloween night
when she predicted our deaths.

01:49.192 --> 01:50.777
Are you serious right now?

01:50.777 --> 01:52.654
Alex, she knew exactly
how Olivia was gonna die.

01:52.654 --> 01:54.740
Yeah, and now she’s dead.

01:54.740 --> 01:56.783
That’s what matters.

01:56.783 --> 01:59.661
So, what, you want to go
to the cops or something?

01:59.661 --> 02:01.580
I don’t know. Maybe.

02:01.580 --> 02:03.874
Candace, you know how crazy
you sound right now?

02:03.874 --> 02:05.083
You need to snap out of it.

02:05.083 --> 02:06.001
[McKenna] Hey.

02:07.669 --> 02:09.421
What’s goin’ on?

02:09.421 --> 02:11.673
[Alex] Candace thinks we should
go to the police because,

02:11.673 --> 02:14.259
I don’t know, Violet’s a witch
and hexed Olivia?

02:14.259 --> 02:15.594
That certified freak
knew exactly

02:15.594 --> 02:16.762
how our friend was gonna die,

02:16.762 --> 02:18.513
but I’m the crazy one?

02:18.513 --> 02:20.057
So you think she cut
Olivia’s brakes or something?

02:20.057 --> 02:21.892
I don’t know, okay?

02:21.892 --> 02:23.518
I don’t know how she did it,

02:23.518 --> 02:24.811
but I’m telling you,
something’s not right.

02:24.811 --> 02:27.272
Look, I know that we’re all

02:27.272 --> 02:28.607
really freaked out right now,

02:28.607 --> 02:30.484
but this is not the time.

02:30.484 --> 02:32.110
Olivia’s gone.

02:32.110 --> 02:34.988
Can we please focus
on that right now?

02:34.988 --> 02:36.990
Please.

[church bell tolling]

02:43.330 --> 02:46.208
[organ playing]

03:03.725 --> 03:06.019
What the hell is she doing?

03:12.567 --> 03:15.195
It’s so good
to see you guys.

03:15.195 --> 03:17.864
I can’t believe this is real.

03:17.864 --> 03:19.116
[sniffles]

03:22.327 --> 03:23.912
[pastor]
We are gathered here today

03:23.912 --> 03:25.247
to celebrate the life

03:25.247 --> 03:27.165
of our beloved friend
and daughter,

03:27.165 --> 03:28.875
Olivia Richmond.

03:28.875 --> 03:30.585
Before we begin the service,

03:30.585 --> 03:32.587
Olivia’s brother Henry

03:32.587 --> 03:34.214
will share some words.

03:42.764 --> 03:46.977
[Henry] My sister was
more than just a sister.

03:46.977 --> 03:49.229
You know,
she was my best friend.

03:49.229 --> 03:51.189
[crying]
You know, Olivia was‐‐

03:51.189 --> 03:54.443
um, she was an amazing soul,

03:54.443 --> 03:57.362
who always, uh,
saw the best in people,

03:57.362 --> 04:00.407
even if they couldn’t
see it in themselves.

04:00.407 --> 04:02.117
I’ll always wonder

04:02.117 --> 04:03.702
what kind of life
she would have led.

04:03.702 --> 04:05.871
What kind of career
she would have chosen.

04:05.871 --> 04:08.665
‐[heartbeat]
‐[Henry’s voice fades]

04:17.632 --> 04:19.885
[panicked breathing]

04:21.887 --> 04:24.181
McKenna, what’s wrong?

04:24.181 --> 04:25.599
It’s okay. I’m here.

04:25.599 --> 04:27.058
I’m right here.

04:32.314 --> 04:34.441
[theme music playing]

04:42.240 --> 04:43.408
[dog barking]

04:46.161 --> 04:47.746
Hey.

04:47.746 --> 04:51.208
If you’re not feeling up
for school,

04:51.208 --> 04:53.084
you should just stay home.

04:53.084 --> 04:54.628
Um, it’s fine.

04:54.628 --> 04:57.005
We all have
counseling sessions today.

04:59.382 --> 05:01.218
We could call Dr. Schwartz.

05:01.218 --> 05:02.552
I mean, I know you haven’t
seen her in a while, but‐‐

05:02.552 --> 05:03.470
I said it’s fine.

05:06.765 --> 05:08.433
Listen, Mack?

05:08.433 --> 05:10.811
I have been trying
to give you space,

05:10.811 --> 05:13.146
but you’ve just been
shutting me down for days now.

05:13.146 --> 05:15.524
[McKenna] Yeah, after you
humiliated me at the party.

05:15.524 --> 05:19.319
You know, Dad asked me
to live with him

05:19.319 --> 05:22.364
after you guys split,
and I told him no,

05:22.364 --> 05:24.491
because I wanted to make sure
that you were okay,

05:24.491 --> 05:25.867
and now it’s been two years,

05:25.867 --> 05:27.911
and I can’t
keep holding your hand.

05:27.911 --> 05:29.955
I have my own life,

05:29.955 --> 05:31.748
and I have friends
who need me right now.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.210
I have to go.

05:37.671 --> 05:39.214
[door opens and closes]

05:39.214 --> 05:40.924
[Noreen]
And then Olivia told me

05:40.924 --> 05:42.551
my shoes were really cute,

05:42.551 --> 05:43.927
and I feel like
if she didn’t die,

05:43.927 --> 05:45.720
we could have been
really good friends.

05:45.720 --> 05:47.013
That’s great, Noreen.

05:47.013 --> 05:48.473
Thank you for that story.

05:48.473 --> 05:51.393
Anyone else like to share?

05:51.393 --> 05:53.520
Okay. Keep in mind

05:53.520 --> 05:55.105
if you want to talk
in a more anonymous setting,

05:55.105 --> 05:56.314
the peer counseling hotline

05:56.314 --> 05:58.233
will have extended hours
this week.

05:58.233 --> 06:00.360
And for those of you who’d like
to volunteer for the hotline,

06:00.360 --> 06:02.612
there will be an orientation
after school today.

06:02.612 --> 06:05.615
We have a representative
from the peer counseling team.

06:05.615 --> 06:06.741
Violet Simmons?

06:09.077 --> 06:10.704
I got certified
as a peer counselor
at my last school,

06:10.704 --> 06:12.205
so I’m happy to help.

06:12.205 --> 06:14.291
Peer counsel? Who would
want to listen to her?

06:14.291 --> 06:17.168
So if any of you
want to sign up or talk?

06:19.045 --> 06:20.505
Thank you, Violet.

06:20.505 --> 06:21.840
What a wonderful service
you’re providing.

06:21.840 --> 06:24.885
[class bell rings]

06:24.885 --> 06:26.887
Oh, and one more thing.

06:26.887 --> 06:29.306
McKenna Brady, can you please
stop by the principal’s office?

06:29.306 --> 06:31.892
Uh, okay.

06:38.481 --> 06:39.941
Trey, it’s me, McKenna.

06:39.941 --> 06:41.860
I heard about you
being in the accident,

06:41.860 --> 06:43.069
and I’m so sorry,

06:43.069 --> 06:44.404
but I really need
to talk to you.

06:44.404 --> 06:45.989
Can you call me back?

06:45.989 --> 06:47.949
There you are.
Everything okay?

06:47.949 --> 06:49.326
Yeah, what did Morris want?

06:49.326 --> 06:50.952
Nothing. He just wanted
to check in.

06:50.952 --> 06:53.163
It’s kind of pointless,
but he means well.

06:53.163 --> 06:54.956
‐[Candace] That’s it?
‐[McKenna] Pretty much.

06:54.956 --> 06:57.417
And this,
uh, student council thing,

06:57.417 --> 07:00.670
I guess they’re trying to find
someone to fill Olivia’s spot.

07:00.670 --> 07:04.007
Hey, guys,
you think Olivia’s parents

07:04.007 --> 07:05.675
will be okay
with the GoFundMe thing?

07:05.675 --> 07:07.385
I mean, I love the idea

07:07.385 --> 07:08.637
of planting the tree
in the school in Olivia’s name,

07:08.637 --> 07:11.306
but maybe it’s too soon.

07:11.306 --> 07:13.016
We should ask.

07:13.016 --> 07:15.185
Maybe we should stop
by their place after school?

07:15.185 --> 07:18.104
Yeah, and I’ll
bring this to them, too.

07:18.104 --> 07:19.856
[Violet] Hey.

07:19.856 --> 07:22.400
Did I hear you guys are
stopping by the Richmonds’?

07:22.400 --> 07:25.403
Uh... yeah, why?

07:25.403 --> 07:28.073
I just heard what you guys
are doing for Olivia’s family,

07:28.073 --> 07:29.366
and it sounds amazing.

07:29.366 --> 07:31.409
Thanks. We should go.

07:31.409 --> 07:33.286
[Violet]
Do you mind if I tag along?

07:33.286 --> 07:35.580
I really want to
give my condolences.

07:35.580 --> 07:37.499
I didn’t get a chance
at the funeral.

07:37.499 --> 07:40.001
Uh, sure.

07:40.001 --> 07:41.586
I guess.

07:41.586 --> 07:43.338
Okay.
I’ll see you guys there.

07:47.217 --> 07:49.260
What?
What was I supposed to say?

07:49.260 --> 07:51.179
"Don’t be nice
to Olivia’s parents"?

07:51.179 --> 07:55.058
So you thought it’d be better
to invite that psychopath.

07:55.058 --> 07:55.975
Great idea, Alex.

07:58.395 --> 07:59.521
[Alex scoffs]

08:04.442 --> 08:07.737
[class bell rings]

08:07.737 --> 08:09.531
[Candace]
We just wanted to check in

08:09.531 --> 08:11.574
to see if there
was anything we could do.

08:13.159 --> 08:14.703
[choking up]
Thank you, um...

08:16.079 --> 08:17.080
this means a lot.

08:18.957 --> 08:21.000
We’re still trying
to figure out what happened.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.502
I know the police
have talked to the boy

08:22.502 --> 08:24.212
who was driving the car,
but I‐‐

08:24.212 --> 08:26.506
But we don’t need to talk
about that right now.

08:26.506 --> 08:28.216
[footsteps]

08:28.216 --> 08:32.053
This was a very kind gesture.

08:32.053 --> 08:34.097
Olivia was lucky
to have such good friends.

08:34.097 --> 08:35.557
Excuse me.

08:37.058 --> 08:38.476
[Mrs. Richmond]
She loved you all so much.

08:38.476 --> 08:40.353
You were her girls.

09:04.794 --> 09:10.508
I wish there was something
I could say or do

09:10.508 --> 09:12.594
to make this better, but...

09:15.263 --> 09:16.181
I can’t.

09:23.980 --> 09:25.065
When Jennie died,

09:26.775 --> 09:28.610
people kept trying to help me.

09:30.320 --> 09:36.034
I remember them suggesting
therapy, meditation.

09:38.328 --> 09:41.873
The only thing
that really helped was time.

09:44.125 --> 09:46.586
One day,

09:46.586 --> 09:51.299
it was like this huge weight
had been lifted.

09:54.594 --> 09:55.637
It was still there,

09:55.637 --> 09:59.140
but it got better.

10:01.392 --> 10:02.560
The next day,

10:04.020 --> 10:05.730
and the day after that...

10:12.112 --> 10:14.781
I just want you to know
that you should take

10:16.491 --> 10:18.118
as much time as you need.

10:21.579 --> 10:22.997
I’ll be here.

10:40.473 --> 10:42.183
[whispering]
It’s gonna be okay.

10:53.653 --> 10:55.655
[Candace] Oh, and we
also wanted to ask,

10:55.655 --> 10:59.868
we were talking
about maybe planting a tree

10:59.868 --> 11:03.329
at the school in Olivia’s name
and doing a fundraiser.

11:03.329 --> 11:06.249
Like a, uh, GoFundMe campaign?

11:06.249 --> 11:08.835
Yeah,
if it’s okay with you guys.

11:08.835 --> 11:11.296
Actually, I made a mock‐up
of the campaign

11:11.296 --> 11:12.714
if you guys
want to take a look.

11:16.759 --> 11:19.512
We all know how much
Olivia loved our school,

11:19.512 --> 11:22.891
so we just wanted to memorialize
her there in some way.

11:22.891 --> 11:26.436
I know I wasn’t
very close with Olivia,

11:26.436 --> 11:29.022
but she was such a wonderful
friend to all of us,

11:29.022 --> 11:31.816
I just‐‐ I wanted to repay her
in some way.

11:33.776 --> 11:35.528
I think it’s a great idea.

11:35.528 --> 11:38.907
Yes. This is exactly
what Olivia would have wanted.

11:38.907 --> 11:41.451
Thank you so much
for organizing this, Violet.

11:50.919 --> 11:52.086
[door closes]

11:52.086 --> 11:53.755
What the hell was that?

11:53.755 --> 11:56.382
I’m sorry I didn’t
run it by you guys.

11:56.382 --> 11:57.926
I just heard you talking
about it,

11:57.926 --> 11:59.260
and it sounded

11:59.260 --> 12:01.012

We don’t need your help, Violet.
You barely knew Olivia.

12:03.890 --> 12:07.060
Well, obviously, I didn’t know
her as long as you guys did,

12:07.060 --> 12:09.187
but she was really nice to me,

12:09.187 --> 12:11.147
and I felt like
we were becoming friends.

12:11.147 --> 12:12.815
Yeah, because
she felt bad for you.

12:12.815 --> 12:13.900
You don’t even know her.

12:13.900 --> 12:15.318
You don’t know any of us!

12:15.318 --> 12:18.154
I was just trying
to do something nice.

12:18.154 --> 12:20.823

I’ll take the page down.

12:20.823 --> 12:22.742
Look, I know
what you’re doing, okay?

12:22.742 --> 12:25.495
You might be fooling
everyone else with this
"nice girl" bullshit,

12:25.495 --> 12:27.413
but I know a psychopath
when I see one.

12:27.413 --> 12:29.249
So just stay
the hell away from us.

12:32.377 --> 12:33.836
I’m sorry.

How you doin’?

13:24.929 --> 13:27.140
I guess that’s
kind of a stupid question.

13:27.140 --> 13:28.182
Um...

13:29.392 --> 13:30.893
Look, I know that

13:30.893 --> 13:32.812
we haven’t
really talked in a while,

13:32.812 --> 13:36.524
and this is
kind of crazy, but...

13:36.524 --> 13:38.276
I really need to know.

13:38.276 --> 13:41.654
Did anything weird
happen before the crash?

13:41.654 --> 13:43.948
Oh. So that’s
why you’re here?

13:43.948 --> 13:45.950
You think I was high, too?

13:45.950 --> 13:47.660
No. No.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.370
I’m just trying to figure out
what happened.

13:49.370 --> 13:51.039
I know what everybody’s
saying about me, okay?

13:52.707 --> 13:54.709
I sell off a little
of my ADD prescription,

13:54.709 --> 13:56.419
and all of sudden,
I’m the drug kingpin.

13:56.419 --> 13:59.464
And for the record,
I wasn’t high.

13:59.464 --> 14:01.632
I don’t even get high.

14:01.632 --> 14:04.135
It’s not too far of a stretch
to assume that, is it?

14:04.135 --> 14:07.096
Christ, McKenna,
I didn’t kill your friend!

14:09.807 --> 14:11.267
And while we’re at it,

14:11.267 --> 14:13.019
I didn’t kill
your sister, either.

14:13.019 --> 14:14.854
Jennie was my friend.

Shit!

14:42.632 --> 14:44.884
Do you want to jump in?

14:44.884 --> 14:46.469
Just because I’m a lesbian
doesn’t mean I know
what I’m doing.

14:46.469 --> 14:48.930
That makes two of us.

14:48.930 --> 14:50.056

14:53.893 --> 14:56.437
Look, I’m sorry about yesterday.

14:56.437 --> 14:58.397
I really liked Olivia,

14:58.397 --> 15:00.108
but you guys
were her real friends,

15:00.108 --> 15:01.734
and I shouldn’t
have stepped in like that.

15:01.734 --> 15:04.612
Yeah, I’m not gonna lie,
it was a little weird.

15:04.612 --> 15:07.573
I know you guys hate me
after what happened.

15:07.573 --> 15:09.242
I was just trying
to do something nice,

15:09.242 --> 15:11.369
but I feel
like I made everything worse.

15:11.369 --> 15:12.286
We don’t‐‐

15:13.830 --> 15:16.457
Okay, Candace

15:16.457 --> 15:19.919
but that accident
was a coincidence.

15:19.919 --> 15:21.546
You can’t blame yourself
for that.

15:21.546 --> 15:23.714
Thank you
for saying that, Alex.

15:25.883 --> 15:28.386
Look, I don’t know if I should
talk about this,

15:28.386 --> 15:30.221
but is McKenna okay?

15:30.221 --> 15:32.765
I was really worried
about her at the funeral.

15:32.765 --> 15:35.017
It looked like
she was having a panic attack.

15:35.017 --> 15:36.894
‐Really?
‐Yeah, and I don’t
want to be pushy,

15:36.894 --> 15:39.021
but I know she
lost her sister.

15:39.021 --> 15:41.232
Has anything like that
ever happened before?

15:41.232 --> 15:43.568
Yeah, um,

15:43.568 --> 15:46.779
she had a rough time
after Jennie died.

15:46.779 --> 15:49.448
We all did,
but for McKenna...

15:51.492 --> 15:53.870
She was the one
who found Jennie after...

15:55.204 --> 15:56.539
It‐‐ It really messed her up.

15:56.539 --> 15:58.666
She even dropped
out of school for a bit.

15:58.666 --> 16:01.169
Wow, I had no idea.

16:01.169 --> 16:03.838
I’m really glad
she had you guys, though.

16:03.838 --> 16:06.090
Well, we tried
to be there for her.

16:06.090 --> 16:08.885
But after her dad bailed,
it was tough.

16:08.885 --> 16:11.846
She mentioned her sister
had a heart attack.

16:11.846 --> 16:14.724
How does that even happen
to a 16‐year‐old?

16:14.724 --> 16:16.058
[Alex]
She... had a bad heart.

16:16.058 --> 16:17.310
It’s‐‐ It’s a genetic thing.

16:17.310 --> 16:19.020
McKenna has it, too.

16:19.020 --> 16:21.105
You know what,
I shouldn’t have brought it up.

16:21.105 --> 16:22.523
Just forget I said anything.

16:22.523 --> 16:25.318
Yeah, I’m gonna, um,

[engine starts]

17:55.992 --> 17:57.618
I’m sorry, sweetie.

17:57.618 --> 17:59.328
I was closing out
the open house,

17:59.328 --> 18:00.621
and then this couple called,

18:00.621 --> 18:01.789
and they were begging me
to stay longer.

18:01.789 --> 18:03.833
It’s okay.
Can we just go?

18:03.833 --> 18:07.253
Was it a rough day,
being there without Olivia?

18:10.548 --> 18:12.550
You know, in eighth grade,

18:12.550 --> 18:15.845
people used to call me
"the clearance rack
Olivia Richmond."

18:15.845 --> 18:18.764
And when she found out,
she made them stop.

18:18.764 --> 18:22.268
I used to hate
being in her shadow,

18:22.268 --> 18:24.395
but the part
that made me feel worse

18:24.395 --> 18:26.355
was that she was
such a good friend to me,

18:26.355 --> 18:28.316
and she never tried
to make me feel bad.

18:28.316 --> 18:29.817
And now she’s dead.

18:32.528 --> 18:35.573
So why do I feel like
I’m still competing with her?

18:35.573 --> 18:38.284
Honey, listen to me.

18:38.284 --> 18:40.786
Nothing you are feeling
right now is wrong.

18:40.786 --> 18:42.705
It doesn’t feel that way.

18:42.705 --> 18:44.582
You’ll get through this.

18:46.417 --> 18:47.960
I know it’s hard,

18:47.960 --> 18:50.630
but even though Olivia is gone,

18:50.630 --> 18:53.883
it’s okay for you to think
about who you want to be.

18:53.883 --> 18:55.551
Isn’t that what your friend
would want,

18:55.551 --> 18:57.511
for you to live your own life?

19:20.660 --> 19:22.078

I just thought
with everything going on...

19:36.926 --> 19:38.803
How are you feeling?

19:38.803 --> 19:41.097
You’re not having
those panic attacks again?

19:41.097 --> 19:42.223
No.

19:42.223 --> 19:43.683
No, I’m fine.

19:43.683 --> 19:44.934
