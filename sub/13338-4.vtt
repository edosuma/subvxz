WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:00.200
.

00:08.000 --> 00:10.760
Watch out, Newcastle. We are back!

00:10.840 --> 00:14.240
(all cheering)
We're gonna go fucking acka.

00:14.320 --> 00:17.160
It's time to smash Newcastle.
We're on the pull!

00:17.240 --> 00:19.240
Things are gonna go pure radge.

00:21.120 --> 00:22.520
What the fuck?

00:22.600 --> 00:24.040
(screams)
(shouting)

00:24.120 --> 00:25.560
Calm the fuck down!

00:25.640 --> 00:28.480
This time, there's gonna be
more necking on.

00:30.680 --> 00:33.200
More kick-offs.
(screams)

00:33.280 --> 00:35.000
More drama.

00:35.920 --> 00:38.400
Slag! More tears, more tantrums,

00:38.480 --> 00:41.480
more loving, more shagging,
more drunk-ness.

00:41.560 --> 00:44.240
Howay, Chloe, man.
And more falling over!

00:44.320 --> 00:46.640
Sounds fucking mint!

00:47.640 --> 00:50.160
Watch out, Newcastle,
cos the Geordie squad

00:50.240 --> 00:52.000
are back in the fucking mix.

00:53.160 --> 00:56.480
Let's get this fucking party
started. Let the games begin.

00:56.560 --> 00:58.520
You are a fucking liar!

00:58.600 --> 01:02.560
Newcastle! Oi, oi!
It's time to tear up the toon.

01:02.640 --> 01:04.640
(all scream)

01:11.480 --> 01:14.440
Hi!
Fucking fresh fanny?

01:14.520 --> 01:16.560
Scott's the one
who'll fuck you over.

01:16.640 --> 01:20.080
That's why I'm in love with him.
Don't worry. I won't go near Scott.

01:20.160 --> 01:22.080
What the fuck is Chantelle's game?

01:22.160 --> 01:24.080
Three, four and five.

01:24.160 --> 01:27.080
What happened to girl code?
(screams)

01:28.280 --> 01:30.600
You what?
What?! Wow.

01:30.680 --> 01:33.920
I'm coming back into the house
with a massive secret.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.040
I'm back with Kyle.

01:35.120 --> 01:37.320
Are you coming on the pull?
We'll see.

01:37.400 --> 01:40.440
Why is Holly
being such a boring fucker?

01:41.680 --> 01:44.960
At least we know how to have fun,
Holly, you boring bitch.

01:45.040 --> 01:48.920
Now. She can fucking talk,
with her fucking history.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.680
You have been with every boy
in this house.

01:52.760 --> 01:55.800
Fuck.Don't fucking ever
speak to me again.

01:55.880 --> 01:59.000
They're meant to be best friends.
I can't be in this house.

01:59.080 --> 02:02.640
I've never been hurt like this
and especially not by Charlotte.

02:02.720 --> 02:05.760
I'm leaving and I don't know
if I'm ever gonna come back.

02:07.160 --> 02:09.560
I should have a degree
in pulling women.

02:09.640 --> 02:11.960
I would never kiss anyone
without a six pack.

02:12.040 --> 02:14.080
I'm gonna tear this house up.

02:14.160 --> 02:16.440
I wrap the lads
round my little finger.

02:16.520 --> 02:20.280
I'm preened to perfection.
I'm totally crackers, me, like.

02:20.360 --> 02:22.680
I'm cheeky, colourful
and full of mischief.

02:22.760 --> 02:25.280
I'm fake, I'm flirty
and I've got double Fs.

02:25.360 --> 02:28.120
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

02:37.680 --> 02:39.880
Aaron. Did you fucking smash
that bird?

02:39.960 --> 02:42.880
Fucking yes.
Oh, lad! (laughs)

02:42.960 --> 02:46.000
Last night was fucking wicked.
Not only did I go ten rounds

02:46.080 --> 02:49.840
with that bird, the boys also beat
the girls to the Shag Pad. Result.

02:49.920 --> 02:52.120
Yous not done anything
apart from kiss?

02:52.200 --> 02:53.600
Nothing. On my mam's life.

02:53.680 --> 02:56.120
Why are you smiling?
(laughs) Oh, Scott!

02:56.200 --> 02:59.160
I can smell the stench of bullshit
coming from that bed.

02:59.240 --> 03:00.680
You are a fucking dick.

03:00.760 --> 03:01.760
What happened?!

03:01.840 --> 03:05.480
Nothing happened last night
but maybe it did the other night.

03:05.560 --> 03:08.320
Since the full time
we've been lying in bed together,

03:08.400 --> 03:12.960
I've touched his willy once. It was
literally two seconds. Was it or not?

03:13.040 --> 03:15.720
No. It was definitely longer
than that. (laughs)

03:15.800 --> 03:17.200
About five seconds.

03:18.880 --> 03:21.920
Aaron, I don't know what
you're laughing at. I'm in bed

03:22.000 --> 03:24.360
with the bird whose name
is tattooed on you.

03:24.440 --> 03:26.880
Five pumps and a squirt!
(laughs)

03:28.000 --> 03:30.240
I think this time
I'm gonna be top shagger

03:30.320 --> 03:31.720
cos by the looks of things,

03:31.800 --> 03:34.360
Scott won't be able
to last the distance anyway.

03:34.440 --> 03:36.800
Pump, pump, squirt.
Pump, pump, squirt.

03:39.560 --> 03:42.920
I've just woken up in the girls'
room. Well, this is weird.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.280
I have not been in this room
for a while.

03:45.360 --> 03:49.800
Where's Holly? I must be dreaming
because Holly isn't in my bed.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.960
To make things worse,
Charlotte's woke up still pissed

03:58.040 --> 04:01.280
and she can't remember anything
she said to Holly last night.

04:01.360 --> 04:02.480
What the hell?

04:02.560 --> 04:06.360
I was absolutely mortal last night
and cannot remember a thing.

04:06.440 --> 04:08.280
Someone needs to fill me in pronto.

04:08.360 --> 04:09.800
Nathan!

04:11.040 --> 04:13.040
Were you in our taxi last night?
Yes.

04:13.120 --> 04:16.960
Right. Please tell me and Charlotte
and Gary what the hell's going on.

04:17.040 --> 04:19.000
Last night, shit got real
in the taxi.

04:19.080 --> 04:21.560
I've never seen them
go at each other like that.

04:21.640 --> 04:23.920
You jumped on top of Charlotte.
In the taxi?

04:24.000 --> 04:26.280
And started necking on with her.
(giggles)

04:26.360 --> 04:30.320
Then Holly said, "Stop it cos I
don't want yous to look like slags."

04:30.400 --> 04:33.080
You went,
"How the fuck can I look like a slag

04:33.160 --> 04:36.080
when you've slept
with every single boy in the house?"

04:36.160 --> 04:39.000
This is the worst thing
I could've ever said to Holly.

04:39.080 --> 04:41.680
The one thing that bothers her most
is her past.

04:41.760 --> 04:43.640
This is so serious.

04:45.920 --> 04:48.400
I've been in the girls' room.
Holly's not here.

04:48.480 --> 04:50.040
Is she gone?
Yeah.

04:50.120 --> 04:51.640
Fuck.

04:51.720 --> 04:54.760
Is it any coincidence that
since I stopped blasting Holly

04:54.840 --> 04:57.000
two year ago,
she's became boring as fuck

04:57.080 --> 05:00.360
because she's not getting
her weekly subscription of banter?

05:04.320 --> 05:08.040
I don't think Scott realises
that Chantelle has him on a leash

05:08.120 --> 05:11.560
so me and Gaz are taking him
for a spray tan and some man time.

05:11.640 --> 05:13.320
Come back looking mahogany.

05:13.400 --> 05:15.200
Like a mahogany chess board.

05:15.280 --> 05:18.120
I've been spending a lot of time
with Chantelle lately

05:18.200 --> 05:20.240
so it's good
to be out with the lads.

05:20.320 --> 05:23.000
I'm ready!
Get the tan on that chopper.

05:23.080 --> 05:25.640
Scott needs a tan
cos he's going on the pull.

05:25.720 --> 05:28.000
Aaron needs a tan
cos he's going on the pull.

05:28.080 --> 05:30.720
Man just needs a tan to look good.
(guffaws)

05:31.800 --> 05:34.680
As much as I feel like
getting one over on Scott,

05:34.760 --> 05:37.640
I do miss my partner in crime
when it comes to pulling.

05:37.720 --> 05:40.120
All looking good. On form.
Woo-hoo-hoo!

05:40.200 --> 05:43.560
I've realised every kick-off
has came from the girls so fuck it.

05:43.640 --> 05:46.680
Tonight, when the boys are ready,
we're just gonna go out.

05:46.760 --> 05:50.040
We're not gonna wait for the girls.
We can meet them in the club.

05:50.120 --> 05:52.880
The bronziest three lads
in Newcastle.

05:54.120 --> 05:56.800
Hello. Fucking hell,
yous are like Oompa Loompas!

05:56.880 --> 06:00.600
Oi, oi. The boys have come back
looking like the three ugly sisters.

06:00.680 --> 06:04.240
I don't know who's more orange
but I'd be getting my money back.

06:04.320 --> 06:07.000
Right. We're gonna go and get ready.
Shower time.

06:07.080 --> 06:09.760
Fuck me, Scott. Did they spray tan
your eyes shut

06:09.840 --> 06:12.800
or did you just decide to ignore us
when you got back in?

06:13.840 --> 06:16.360
We all look amazing.
Now there's one thing to do.

06:16.440 --> 06:18.760
Hit Tiger Tiger
and have an epic night.

06:18.840 --> 06:21.120
We're off, see you at the club.
Really?

06:21.200 --> 06:22.560
See you in a bit.
Later.

06:22.640 --> 06:25.560
It's nice to get out with the lads
instead of waiting

06:25.640 --> 06:28.200
for the girls
to get their shit together.

06:29.960 --> 06:33.640
You gotta get used to this.
They just piss off and leave us.

06:33.720 --> 06:35.840
Howay, Scott.
I haven't seen you all day

06:35.920 --> 06:38.320
then you just decide to fuck off
with the lads.

06:38.400 --> 06:40.680
You need to put more effort in
if you want me.

06:40.760 --> 06:43.480
And do things on their own
and act like we're the mugs

06:43.560 --> 06:46.520
who follow them.
I wouldn't have wanted to go anyway.

06:46.600 --> 06:50.640
It looks like you have just been
pied by Scott. Ha-ha-ha!

06:50.720 --> 06:53.520
Is everyone ready, then?
Yeah.Yeah.Let's go.Whoo!

06:53.600 --> 06:55.760
Tonight's the first night
without Holly

06:55.840 --> 06:58.000
and even though
I shouldn't be happy,

06:58.080 --> 07:01.400
I feel like there's a weight lifted
with her not around. Cheers!

07:01.480 --> 07:03.800
Whoo!Whoo!
Whoop-whoop!

07:06.440 --> 07:09.240
We get to Tiger Tiger
and everything's perfect.

07:12.880 --> 07:15.840
It's just the lads having drinks
but here come the girls.

07:15.920 --> 07:18.440
Let's just hope
they don't kill the vibe.

07:19.680 --> 07:22.760
I walk in and it's like Scott
hasn't even noticed us.

07:22.840 --> 07:24.880
What a fucking nob-head.

07:52.920 --> 07:56.640
I know I should be feeling guilty
about what happened with Holly...

07:57.680 --> 08:00.600
...but to be honest,
I'm just having way too much fun.

08:00.680 --> 08:02.120
Cheers!

08:02.200 --> 08:05.520
I'm looking over at Charlotte
and she's actually having fun.

08:05.600 --> 08:08.480
And Holly's not here.
Is that just a coincidence?

08:10.080 --> 08:13.680
We're all having such a good night
and it just reminds us

08:13.760 --> 08:16.360
that this is what the old Holly
would've loved.

08:18.160 --> 08:21.840
I go over to Scott and Chantelle and
it seems a bit frosty between them.

08:21.920 --> 08:23.520
I'm not gonna lie, I love it.

08:25.040 --> 08:28.240
I really like Scott
but if this is him making an effort,

08:28.320 --> 08:30.000
he might as well not bother.

08:30.080 --> 08:32.720
Scott, you gotta tell the girl,
"You look nice,"

08:32.800 --> 08:34.160
make sure they're OK.

08:34.240 --> 08:36.320
That is what you do to graft.

08:38.200 --> 08:41.600
Chantelle looks frosty tonight
so I'm gonna be the gentleman I am

08:41.680 --> 08:43.600
and find out what's wrong with her.

08:45.440 --> 08:48.400
He needs a proper kick up the arse
so I've got a plan.

08:48.480 --> 08:51.280
I'm gonna friend-zone him
and see if that works.

08:57.800 --> 09:01.040
I cannot be dealing with this, me.
This girl is so hot and cold,

09:01.120 --> 09:04.120
I might as well stick my dick
in a fucking thermometer.

09:07.240 --> 09:10.960
Fuck. He actually wants
to just be friends.

09:11.040 --> 09:12.320
Well, that backfired.

09:22.080 --> 09:23.800
Tonight is amazing.

09:23.880 --> 09:27.640
I'm mortal, I'm pure dancing,
a radgie. What a belter.

09:29.160 --> 09:32.880
This is what our nights out should be
like. Everyone having a laugh.

09:34.280 --> 09:37.000
Fuck it, let's just go home
and carry on this vibe.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.320
What happened with Chantelle, Scott?

09:40.400 --> 09:43.520
She went, "We should leave it."
I went, "What do you mean?"

09:43.600 --> 09:45.920
She went, "Just friends."
I went, "Ha-ha".

09:46.000 --> 09:48.200
Has she actually
just friend-zoned him

09:48.280 --> 09:50.880
after he said he wants her
to be his girlfriend?

09:50.960 --> 09:52.000
What a mug.

09:53.560 --> 09:56.480
I've come out the club,
I'm drunk as fuck.

09:56.560 --> 09:58.400
I'm horny and I miss my boyfriend.

09:58.480 --> 10:00.440
All I want is some love
and affection.

10:05.360 --> 10:06.360
Boring.

10:06.440 --> 10:09.280
What the hell's going on, like?
(giggles)

10:09.360 --> 10:11.960
Ah, fuck it. I'm just gonna roll
with it.

10:12.040 --> 10:13.040
(shouts)

10:14.040 --> 10:17.600
I'm necking on with Nathan
and it's proper passionate.

10:17.680 --> 10:21.120
And you know what? I think
he's a better kisser than Scott.

10:24.080 --> 10:26.520
We get back to the house,
everyone's pissed.

10:28.200 --> 10:30.200
Everyone's in a good mood.
Gaz.

10:31.200 --> 10:34.600
Obviously that means one thing.
Bean bag fight!

10:36.240 --> 10:38.680
Aaron, sit down. Poosh.

10:38.760 --> 10:40.800
(all laugh)

10:40.880 --> 10:45.160
Recently it felt like kick-offs had
taken over having fun in the house

10:45.240 --> 10:49.320
so tonight this bean bag fight
is exactly what we needed. Ohhh!

10:54.720 --> 10:58.360
Ah! I'm on such a love buzz tonight.
I don't know what's going on.

10:58.440 --> 11:00.920
Me and Charlotte
seem to be flirting.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.160
You're a slut.
No, you are.

11:03.240 --> 11:05.800
You are.
We have had the best night ever.

11:05.880 --> 11:08.880
A bean bag fight, shits and giggles.

11:08.960 --> 11:11.640
What more could possibly top this?

11:15.000 --> 11:19.920
I know. Lesbian sex with Chloe!

11:23.440 --> 11:26.960
Things have gone from 0 to 100
in a matter of seconds.

11:28.400 --> 11:32.560
Me and Chloe are in the double bed
and this is perfectly acceptable.

11:32.640 --> 11:35.320
I share a bed with Holly
every single night.

11:35.400 --> 11:38.360
But we're naked. But that's fine.
It's hot in here.

11:38.440 --> 11:41.080
Now we're kissing. This is strange.

11:41.160 --> 11:44.920
Chloe's slipping to the bottom
of the bed. What are you doing? Oh!

11:45.000 --> 11:50.280
Oh! What?! Why is your tongue
in my vagina?!

11:51.880 --> 11:54.520
Charlotte's down below
is like Hagrid's beard.

11:54.600 --> 11:56.240
Hairy, that!

11:57.720 --> 11:59.600
Wake up and what do I see?

11:59.680 --> 12:02.360
Charlotte and Chloe carpet-munching.

12:04.560 --> 12:06.600
After that experience,
I know exactly

12:06.680 --> 12:09.560
what to buy Charlotte for Christmas.
A fucking razor.

12:09.640 --> 12:11.640
(groaning)

12:18.600 --> 12:24.080
(yawns)Girls. What the fuck
were yous doing last night?

12:25.320 --> 12:27.720
(both laugh)

12:27.800 --> 12:31.080
I woke up this morning and
remembered what happened last night

12:31.160 --> 12:33.080
and I can't even do
a gnash and dash.

12:33.160 --> 12:36.240
(all laugh)
God!

12:36.320 --> 12:39.760
I know the Dick Detectives
haven't been doing that well lately

12:39.840 --> 12:41.960
but the Clit Detectives!

12:42.040 --> 12:46.960
Now that is just a whole other level
of wrong. Or is it right?

12:47.040 --> 12:51.040
I've got a bit of bad news. If I was
poking, I did lose a fingernail.

12:51.120 --> 12:53.720
(laughs)
There's a floater inside ya.

12:53.800 --> 12:57.720
I'm so glad Holly wasn't here. Wow.
She would've been kicking off.

12:57.800 --> 13:01.320
She would've actually killed us.

13:01.400 --> 13:03.640
If this is what happens
when Holly's away,

13:03.720 --> 13:06.040
I think she needs to get back here
right now.

13:06.120 --> 13:07.920
Holly needs to come back.

13:08.000 --> 13:11.720
Since she's gone,
we've all just went insane.

13:15.160 --> 13:16.640
Well, we got in the taxi.

13:16.720 --> 13:20.720
Then Chantelle started mauling
my face. I kind of enjoyed it.

13:20.800 --> 13:24.360
Looking at the frown on Scott's
face, there's no way I'm gonna admit

13:24.440 --> 13:27.000
it was me who initiated
the kiss with Chantelle.

13:27.080 --> 13:30.960
Aw, mate. I'm going in tonight.
Not only have I been friend-zoned,

13:31.040 --> 13:33.200
now she's necked on
with fucking Nathan.

13:33.280 --> 13:35.360
So it's time for me, Scotty T,

13:35.440 --> 13:38.080
he's got the green light
to spread the fucking D.

13:46.760 --> 13:50.320
Hi.Hi, Anna. Go on, Anna.
Go on, Anna. Hey, Anna.

13:50.400 --> 13:52.600
Can I get you all to sit down?
Fucking hell.

13:52.680 --> 13:55.840
Anna's turned up at the house
instead of making a phone call.

13:55.920 --> 13:59.040
She must be missing Scott,
fucking slag. Where's Holly?

13:59.120 --> 14:00.800
Not here.
She left.

14:00.880 --> 14:03.480
Why?
I had an argument with her, Anna.

14:03.560 --> 14:05.920
Well, I'm not happy
being a worker down.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.560
It needs to be sorted.

14:07.640 --> 14:09.680
The thing is, Anna's like the oracle.

14:09.760 --> 14:11.600
Nothing gets past her.

14:11.680 --> 14:16.640
I've got some work for yous today.
Scott, Nathan and Gaz...

14:16.720 --> 14:18.480
I want yous to check it out. OK?

14:18.560 --> 14:22.160
Anna says she's got a new business
venture called Geordie Tours,

14:22.240 --> 14:25.520
where me and the squad have gotta
test out day time activities

14:25.600 --> 14:27.760
to see if they're fit
for her company.

14:27.840 --> 14:30.400
Charlotte, you need to sort stuff.
Goodbye.

14:30.480 --> 14:32.320
Bye, Anna.
Bye!

14:32.400 --> 14:35.800
I think I'd prefer to go to work
than patch things up with Holly.

14:35.880 --> 14:39.080
You need to speak to Hols, you, kid.
I know. I know.

14:39.160 --> 14:41.040
Thank God we're getting sent to work

14:41.120 --> 14:43.520
so I don't have to hang around
with Chantelle.

14:43.600 --> 14:46.960
Not only am I gonna thank Anna,
I might even show her my cock.

14:47.040 --> 14:51.000
We're driving past the Tyne Bridge
and I can see a zip wire.

14:51.080 --> 14:53.520
Fuck. I don't like heights.

14:53.600 --> 14:56.760
What better to do than zip line off
the Tyne Bridge?

14:56.840 --> 14:58.240
I'm shit scared.

14:58.320 --> 15:00.960
This is definitely one way
to cure a hangover.

15:01.040 --> 15:03.920
Sit on the edge of a bridge
and launch yourself off.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.040
Agh! Whoo!

15:06.120 --> 15:08.120
How the fuck is this work?

15:11.080 --> 15:14.200
Anna, tick. Fucking amazing.

15:14.280 --> 15:15.800
I'm off, mate.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.600
I am definitely going before
that fat fuck Nathan

15:19.680 --> 15:21.520
after he necked on with Chantelle.

15:21.600 --> 15:24.560
Once he gets on that zip wire,
it might as well be seaweed.

15:24.640 --> 15:27.200
That was wicked!
Fuck. This is too much.

15:27.280 --> 15:29.600
Oh, my God. I don't wanna do it!

15:29.680 --> 15:32.400
Oh, fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
Sit down on the bridge.

15:32.480 --> 15:34.280
Fuck. Fuck. Three...

15:34.360 --> 15:35.840
Oh-ho. ...two...

15:35.920 --> 15:39.160
Oh, OK. ...one. Fuck!

15:39.240 --> 15:41.480
(screams) Urgh.

15:41.560 --> 15:43.480
Grah. Oh, God.

15:43.560 --> 15:46.880
I think I've shit myself.
I think I've actually shit myself.

15:46.960 --> 15:48.880
(Gaz) Nathan! Nathan, stop.

15:48.960 --> 15:51.160
Close your arms, Nathan.

15:51.240 --> 15:54.640
(groans) Agh.

15:54.720 --> 15:56.800
Oh.
Are you pooed, lad?

15:56.880 --> 16:00.200
No. That was a-mazing.

16:00.280 --> 16:01.840
I feel like a brand-new man.

16:05.760 --> 16:07.920
Hello, radgies!

16:08.000 --> 16:10.280
Oh, my God.
What have yous been doing, then?

16:10.360 --> 16:13.880
We zip lined off the Tyne Bridge.
I would've fucking loved that.

16:13.960 --> 16:16.240
Char, have you spoke to Hol yet?
No, not yet.

16:16.320 --> 16:19.120
I'm about to phone Holly
and I'm so nervous.

16:19.200 --> 16:21.200
My heart is beating out of my chest.

16:21.280 --> 16:24.400
I just feel like it's gonna be
so awkward.

16:24.480 --> 16:28.160
Hopefully it won't be too awkward.
Hopefully it won't be too awkward.

16:28.240 --> 16:31.680
Charlotte looks that nervous,
it looks like she shit herself.

16:31.760 --> 16:34.120
I wouldn't blame her,
I probably would too.

16:34.200 --> 16:35.200
(dial tone)

16:35.280 --> 16:36.600
(Holly)"Hello?"

16:36.680 --> 16:38.880
Hi, Holly, it's Charlotte.
"Heya."

16:38.960 --> 16:40.480
Do you wanna talk?

16:42.200 --> 16:44.600
"Erm... yeah."
She's answered the phone,

16:44.680 --> 16:46.560
it sounds like she wants to kill us!

16:46.640 --> 16:48.800
This is worse than
I ever even imagined.

16:48.880 --> 16:50.920
Do you wanna meet us later
at the pub?

16:51.000 --> 16:52.200
Right. OK, no bother.

16:52.280 --> 16:53.320
Bye.

16:54.560 --> 16:57.440
Ooh. How did she sound?

16:57.520 --> 16:59.160
So bad.

16:59.240 --> 17:03.360
That was so awkward. And now
I gotta go meet her face-to-face

17:03.440 --> 17:05.600
in a bar. I'm dreading this.

17:05.680 --> 17:07.520
Right. I have to go get ready.

17:07.600 --> 17:09.520
This could be
the clash of the titans

17:09.600 --> 17:12.240
cos I can't see Holly or Charlotte
backing down.

17:12.320 --> 17:14.680
(chants) You're gonna get beat up.
Shut up.

17:14.760 --> 17:16.480
Charlotte. Knock 'em dead.

17:17.480 --> 17:19.000
Charlotte?
Mm-hm.

17:19.080 --> 17:21.520
I see you're a bit nervous
so I got ya some wine.

17:21.600 --> 17:24.920
That's actually a good idea.
I don't want you getting too pissed

17:25.000 --> 17:26.960
because I don't want hair
ripped out.

17:27.040 --> 17:28.440
Give us a glass, I need it.

17:36.800 --> 17:38.040
Right, I'm ready to go.

17:38.120 --> 17:40.920
I'm just hoping that
when I walk in the club later on,

17:41.000 --> 17:42.360
Holly's gonna be with us.

17:42.440 --> 17:45.560
See yous on the other side.
Good luck!Good luck, darling.

17:45.640 --> 17:46.640
Bye.

17:46.720 --> 17:49.720
I feel like I'm sending King Arthur
to slay the dragon.

17:50.640 --> 17:53.440
(sighs)
You off?

17:53.520 --> 17:55.520
I'm gonna go.

17:55.600 --> 17:59.320
You're fine, man.No matter what's
going on with Holly at the minute,

17:59.400 --> 18:02.280
I know the one person
I can always rely on is Gary.

18:02.360 --> 18:03.960
He's completely got my back.

18:04.040 --> 18:07.240
You need to get everything
off your chest. If you hold back

18:07.320 --> 18:10.400
and you just go, "Yeah, Holly,
I'm sorry," she'll sell it.

18:10.480 --> 18:12.960
She'll come back and think
she was in the right.

18:13.040 --> 18:15.040
And it'll happen again.

18:15.120 --> 18:18.120
You need to go and be truthful.
I'm not gonna back down

18:18.200 --> 18:21.960
and I'm not gonna grovel. She needs
to know what I think as well.

18:22.040 --> 18:23.840
(laughs)
Bye.

18:23.920 --> 18:27.240
If Holly is wound up, she's
a fucking nightmare to deal with.

18:27.320 --> 18:30.440
I would not like to be
in Charlotte's shoes.

18:33.960 --> 18:36.000
Aaron, back on the pull tonight?
Yes.

18:36.080 --> 18:37.280
Of course.
Or course.

18:37.360 --> 18:40.560
I've been grafting for ages
with Chantelle

18:40.640 --> 18:44.080
but now it's my first night off
and I am fucking loving it.

18:44.160 --> 18:46.960
I'm on the pull tonight.
Scott is playing with fire

18:47.040 --> 18:49.480
if he thinks he's gonna go
on the pull tonight.

18:49.560 --> 18:52.680
If that happens, cue the arguments.
We'll see.

18:55.400 --> 18:57.560
Me and Charlotte have fell out
in the past

18:57.640 --> 19:00.000
but I do need to go and see
what she's got to say

19:00.080 --> 19:02.480
but if she says anything like
the other night,

19:02.560 --> 19:04.360
there's gonna be a kick-off.

19:06.080 --> 19:08.320
I'm so scared to go meet Holly.

19:09.640 --> 19:14.280
I don't wanna think that I might
have messed up our whole friendship.

19:14.360 --> 19:15.480
She's my best friend

19:15.560 --> 19:18.480
and we've been on such a massive
experience together,

19:18.560 --> 19:22.520
I don't wanna let something stupid
that I've said ruin all of that.

19:23.840 --> 19:27.320
I know that I'm gonna see Charlotte
soon and I'm so nervous.

19:27.400 --> 19:30.280
This is the girl
who I've grew up with for so long

19:30.360 --> 19:34.200
and for me to feel this scared about
seeing her just makes me feel sick.

19:36.480 --> 19:39.080
She's always been the one person
to defend my past

19:39.160 --> 19:41.280
but now she's threw it in my face.

19:41.360 --> 19:44.560
I just don't know if I'm ever
gonna be able to trust her again.

19:44.640 --> 19:46.640
Hi.
Hi, Holly.

19:46.720 --> 19:47.800
How are ya?

19:47.880 --> 19:49.400
I'm all right. How are you?

19:49.480 --> 19:50.480
Got you a drink.

19:53.720 --> 19:57.040
First of all,
I did just want to apologise

19:57.120 --> 19:59.120
for what obviously I said
in the taxi.

19:59.200 --> 20:01.120
The only reason I said it

20:01.200 --> 20:03.920
is because I felt like
you were looking down on me.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.520
Yeah.
I do feel like Holly's changing

20:06.600 --> 20:09.520
but I thought she would at least
try and apologise back

20:09.600 --> 20:12.520
but it seems like she's still
far too angry for that.

20:12.600 --> 20:14.840
The things that were said
in the taxi to me

20:14.920 --> 20:18.240
were very harsh and very horrible.

20:19.480 --> 20:22.280
Charlotte insinuating that
I'd slept with everyone

20:22.360 --> 20:25.600
was just completely unfair.
And for her to use that against me

20:25.680 --> 20:27.120
just fucking really hurt.

20:27.200 --> 20:30.080
I never expected words like that
from my best friend.

20:30.160 --> 20:32.160
I really didn't.

20:32.240 --> 20:34.840
Holly should never have to feel bad
about her past

20:34.920 --> 20:37.440
and I should never have flung that
in her face.

20:38.600 --> 20:40.680
I was gutted at what you said...

20:40.760 --> 20:44.120
and I'm not gonna be able
to forget it overnight.

20:44.200 --> 20:48.000
You know me, Charlotte. I've done
things like that, I've had a laugh.

20:48.080 --> 20:51.080
I never meant for you to think that
I was calling you a slag

20:51.160 --> 20:54.080
or anything, I just didn't want you
to look like one.

20:54.160 --> 20:56.560
It's not just the cab journey.
It's just...

20:56.640 --> 20:59.120
What is going on with you
altogether?

20:59.200 --> 21:02.320
Because it just felt like
you were very distant.

21:02.400 --> 21:05.720
You didn't even wanna...
...be involved in it. Like, at all.

21:07.120 --> 21:10.320
I'm sitting here looking at Holly
and all I can think is,

21:10.400 --> 21:11.720
"Why have you changed?"

21:11.800 --> 21:14.160
It's just making us so frustrated.

21:14.240 --> 21:18.840
I feel like you were a different
Holly at the end of Greece

21:18.920 --> 21:21.120
and you were back
to being the old Holly

21:21.200 --> 21:24.560
and having fun and being carefree.
And when we came back,

21:24.640 --> 21:29.040
I was so excited to have that person
back and you just weren't.

21:31.080 --> 21:35.000
I don't know if me and Charlotte are
ever gonna get that friendship back.

21:35.080 --> 21:37.880
I don't know if we're ever gonna be
as close as we were

21:37.960 --> 21:41.760
and it really hurts because she was
the only person I had in this house

21:41.840 --> 21:45.560
and now that I don't have Kyle here,
I feel like I don't have anyone.

21:51.520 --> 21:54.000
I'm feeling the love
and I'm feeling the club.

21:54.080 --> 21:55.320
Let's get fucked up.

21:55.400 --> 21:56.480
Drinkie-poos.

21:59.640 --> 22:01.760
The club is absolutely bouncing.

22:04.680 --> 22:05.920
(all cheer)

22:06.000 --> 22:07.920
I can't relax. Where is Charlotte?

22:08.000 --> 22:11.160
All I wanna know is what happened
with her and Holly.

22:13.280 --> 22:15.680
I've got something massive to tell
Charlotte

22:15.760 --> 22:18.000
and it's that big
that after I tell her,

22:18.080 --> 22:20.760
I don't know if I'll be able
to go back in the house.

22:20.840 --> 22:23.680
I have been keeping something
from ya.

22:23.760 --> 22:26.440
I've been keeping something
from the whole house

22:26.520 --> 22:30.040
because I am terrified
of everyone's reaction.

22:31.240 --> 22:32.240
Erm...

22:37.720 --> 22:39.720
...I'm back with Kyle.

22:41.760 --> 22:44.920
I can tell by Charlotte's face
that she's not happy about it.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.920
I can see in her eyes
that she thinks I'm a fucking mug.

22:48.000 --> 22:51.040
Aye. Well, obviously,
that explains everything.

22:51.120 --> 22:54.520
Why the hell are you back
with that fucking arsehole

22:54.600 --> 22:58.080
who cheated on ya, who lied to ya,
who finished ya

22:58.160 --> 23:01.080
and who got with someone
straight after that?

23:01.160 --> 23:06.080
Obviously, he did bad stuff but
the thing that I hate him most for

23:06.160 --> 23:08.920
is shattering you as a person.

23:10.600 --> 23:13.120
Cos I will never forgive him...

23:13.200 --> 23:15.680
for making you feel that big.

23:15.760 --> 23:19.960
To feel that you have to be ashamed
of the person you used to be.

23:20.040 --> 23:22.520
Because that's not my best friend.

23:25.320 --> 23:30.000
I will always hate him
for just destroying you as a person.

23:30.800 --> 23:34.200
Charlotte's not happy about
me and Kyle being back together

23:34.280 --> 23:36.840
but I feel like this is
a weight off my shoulders.

23:36.920 --> 23:39.880
My secret's out. I can't wait
to go back and see the family

23:39.960 --> 23:42.560
and hopefully, I can start
having some fun.

23:42.640 --> 23:45.640
I hope that me and you
can get back to a place

23:45.720 --> 23:48.840
where now we can be honest
with each other.

23:48.920 --> 23:51.040
Because I was terrified
of telling ya.

23:51.120 --> 23:53.160
I wish you'd been honest
from the start

23:53.240 --> 23:55.440
and then none of this
would've happened.

23:55.520 --> 23:58.040
I want me and Holly
to re-build our friendship.

23:58.120 --> 24:00.920
And what better way
than by coming out with us all?

24:01.000 --> 24:03.480
Well, I'm pleased
we've had this chat. I am too.

24:03.560 --> 24:05.560
Are you gonna come out tonight?
Yes.

24:05.640 --> 24:07.320
Are you gonna come back?
Yes.

24:07.400 --> 24:10.840
Great. I'm happy about this.
Cheers.

24:14.880 --> 24:17.280
(laughter)

24:23.680 --> 24:26.520
I just hope Charlotte and Holly
walk through the door

24:26.600 --> 24:30.400
and my night will be complete.
# Where are you going... #

24:30.480 --> 24:33.920
So, Holly, how exactly
are you gonna tell them all?

24:34.000 --> 24:35.960
(sighs) I literally don't know.

24:36.040 --> 24:38.760
I'm happy that me and Charlotte
are in a better place

24:38.840 --> 24:40.600
but I'm nervous to go into the club

24:40.680 --> 24:42.840
because I'm gonna have to
tell everyone.

24:42.920 --> 24:46.440
I let Holly off lightly but God
knows what the lads are gonna say.

24:47.880 --> 24:49.520
Oh!

24:49.600 --> 24:52.560
(screaming)Is that two
bowling balls in a bra?

24:52.640 --> 24:55.520
No. It's Holly! Big Tits.
She's back! Yes!

24:55.600 --> 24:58.320
The family is finally back together.

25:02.480 --> 25:04.720
I don't know
if this is a very good idea.

25:08.120 --> 25:10.040
I'm sitting the lads down at once.

25:10.120 --> 25:12.680
I just wanna get it
over and done with.

25:14.720 --> 25:17.080
Have I heard that right?
Holly is with Kyle?

25:28.960 --> 25:33.040
The truth is, Holly, we can sit here
and we can tell ya and tell ya again

25:33.120 --> 25:37.200
but now it's time for us to sit back
and let you make your own mistakes.

25:41.440 --> 25:45.000
I've just said to Holly, if she's
happy, I'm happy but that's a lie.

25:45.080 --> 25:46.240
I am fucking raging.

25:46.320 --> 25:49.600
What that kid done to her in Greece
is fucking unacceptable.

25:57.240 --> 25:59.880
Holly's told the lads
that she's back with Kyle

25:59.960 --> 26:02.000
and they've took it really well.

26:02.080 --> 26:04.480
Looks like we're all
just a bunch of pussies

26:04.560 --> 26:07.760
who can't say
what they really think. Great.

26:11.520 --> 26:13.520
(all cheer)

26:18.960 --> 26:22.000
Everyone's having a pure frisk
and the night is going mint

26:22.080 --> 26:24.560
but now that me and Chantelle
are just friends,

26:24.640 --> 26:28.360
there's nowt stopping me from
getting fucking balls deep tonight.

26:28.440 --> 26:30.640
Wingmen, assemble
on the dance floor.

26:30.720 --> 26:32.720
It's time to go on the fucking pull.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.880
I look over and what do I see?

26:39.960 --> 26:42.480
Aaron trying to egg Scott on
to go on the pull.

26:42.560 --> 26:44.360
What the fuck is his problem?

26:49.040 --> 26:52.840
Scott is only good at one thing
and one thing only.

26:52.920 --> 26:54.160
Pulling girls.

26:56.920 --> 26:59.760
It's great that me and Chantelle
are just friends now.

26:59.840 --> 27:02.560
She'll be absolutely chuffed
out her fucking box

27:02.640 --> 27:04.760
to see me neck on with someone else.

27:09.480 --> 27:12.280
I don't know what's been going on
while I've been gone

27:12.360 --> 27:14.600
but Scott looks as though
he's on the pull.

27:14.680 --> 27:16.600
Chantelle, meet the real Scotty T.

27:29.920 --> 27:32.680
Let's just clarify the facts.
Scott is a grown man.

27:32.760 --> 27:35.120
You said you and him
were just friends

27:35.200 --> 27:39.240
and he wanted to go on the pull.
So how the fuck am I the instigator?

27:46.560 --> 27:48.920
Am I hearing this right?
Aaron's just told us

27:49.000 --> 27:52.600
Scott doesn't care about us. I wish
he would stop getting involved.

27:52.680 --> 27:54.840
Ever since
Chantelle came in this house,

27:54.920 --> 27:56.680
she's been brainwashed by Scott.

27:56.760 --> 27:59.680
Anything he does, she thinks
the lads have put him up to.

27:59.760 --> 28:01.880
I'm sorry but
you're fucking deluded.

28:05.400 --> 28:08.400
This bird is going off
like a fucking Russian grenade.

28:08.480 --> 28:11.440
I need to clear things up.
I'm sure she'll be reasonable.

28:16.920 --> 28:20.000
So glad his cock didn't come
nowhere near me

28:20.080 --> 28:23.960
cos the thought of his smelly cock
makes me wanna fucking vomit.

28:28.720 --> 28:31.200
All right. Calm down, pet.
Fucking hell.

28:34.280 --> 28:36.280
(shouting)

28:40.160 --> 28:43.840
This night is taking a massive turn
for the worst. Thanks, Chantelle.

28:43.920 --> 28:46.320
All right. Shall we go?

28:46.400 --> 28:47.560
Let's go!

28:47.640 --> 28:51.480
This has been the worst night ever.
I just wanna get home. I'm foaming.

28:59.760 --> 29:02.920
We get back to the house and
I can feel the tension in the air.

29:03.920 --> 29:07.320
I'm not gonna lie, the reason I got
so upset is because I liked him

29:07.400 --> 29:10.800
and I wanted it to work out
and now it's all just went tits up.

29:10.880 --> 29:12.360
Whoa. Don't finish that.

29:12.440 --> 29:13.480
False.

29:13.560 --> 29:15.200
Take it out.

29:15.280 --> 29:17.400
(both guffaw)

29:17.480 --> 29:19.760
We just had a laugh together.
What the fuck?

29:19.840 --> 29:23.080
Now they've fallen out, I can
finally flirt with Scott again.

29:23.160 --> 29:25.680
How do you like that, Chantelle?
I swear to God,

29:25.760 --> 29:28.120
I wouldn't piss on the kid
if he was on fire.

29:28.200 --> 29:30.520
You wanted to be single.
If you wanna neck on -

29:30.600 --> 29:33.240
I never wanted to but -
Then why did you do it?

29:33.320 --> 29:36.720
Cos according to Aaron,
you've never given a fuck about us.

29:36.800 --> 29:40.240
Obviously I did at one point because
I wouldn't have got with you.

29:40.320 --> 29:42.480
Nae bother.
This isn't complicated.

29:42.560 --> 29:47.080
Chantelle, you called it off.
That means Scott can go on the pull.

29:47.160 --> 29:48.760
So what do you expect me to do?

29:51.520 --> 29:54.480
No. I'm gonna go and have fun.

29:54.560 --> 29:57.360
I know exactly how Chantelle feels

29:57.440 --> 30:00.520
and I am enjoying
every single moment.

30:00.600 --> 30:03.280
I'm going to bed.
Walk away like you normally do.

30:03.360 --> 30:06.800
Walk away and he's going to pull
tomorrow as usual.

30:06.880 --> 30:10.760
Chantelle, you are fighting
a losing battle. Just give up.

30:10.840 --> 30:13.240
You know what the problem is?
I like you.

30:13.320 --> 30:16.040
Well, you've got a funny way
of fucking showing it.

30:16.120 --> 30:19.760
If you liked us, why the fuck
did you try and go on the pull?

30:21.720 --> 30:23.920
Well, tonight has been eventful.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.840
I know what it's like
when you like a boy in this house

30:26.920 --> 30:29.840
and he tries to go on the pull.
It's soul-destroying.

30:29.920 --> 30:31.880
But what Chantelle needs to realise,

30:31.960 --> 30:34.560
all these boys in this house
are exactly the same.

30:34.640 --> 30:36.720
Nothing has changed.

30:36.800 --> 30:38.800
Nothing has changed.

30:38.880 --> 30:42.640
Fuck, Scott. Fuck, Aaron.
Get me to bed. I'm fucked.

30:42.720 --> 30:44.440
I fucking hate the cunt.

30:59.760 --> 31:01.720
How are you feeling, Chantelle?

31:01.800 --> 31:05.560
I just don't wanna speak to him.
I don't wanna speak to him or Aaron.

31:05.640 --> 31:08.440
Chantelle saying
she'll never speak to Scott again

31:08.520 --> 31:10.960
is like me saying I'll never eat
carbs again.

31:11.040 --> 31:14.680
You should realise, in this house
you can't just not speak to someone

31:14.760 --> 31:18.000
for a long time. You kinda have to
cos you live together.

31:18.080 --> 31:21.440
Me and Holly are on our way
to building up our friendship again

31:21.520 --> 31:24.040
and it's so nice just to wake up
next to her,

31:24.120 --> 31:25.920
even if she has got dog breath.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.480
We've been through everything
together.

31:28.560 --> 31:31.080
It's good to have you back.
Now Holly's back,

31:31.160 --> 31:34.560
there'll be no more lesbian sex
for me. I miss Marnie.

31:41.360 --> 31:45.240
All right, yous. Why don't we go out
for pre-drinks on our own?

31:45.320 --> 31:48.760
That's such a good idea. Me and
the girls are buzzing for tonight.

31:48.840 --> 31:52.040
So buzzing that we're gonna
head out early and ditch the lads.

31:52.120 --> 31:54.480
What you gonna do tonight, then,
Chantelle?

31:54.560 --> 31:57.480
I'm not gonna get angry.
I'm just gonna have a good time.

31:57.560 --> 32:01.080
If there's someone there who I like
then I won't be holding back,

32:01.160 --> 32:03.960
put it that way.
Tonight I'm gonna forget about Scott

32:04.040 --> 32:06.680
and if I pull, I pull.
See how you like it, Scott.

32:06.760 --> 32:09.440
Let's go.
(chants) Girls night, girls night!

32:09.520 --> 32:13.760
(all chant) Fuck the boys,
fuck the boys, fuck the boys.Boys!

32:13.840 --> 32:16.360
Fuck off.
The girls are telling the lads

32:16.440 --> 32:19.240
that they're going out early
and they'll see we later

32:19.320 --> 32:21.800
but I'm thinking,
"I hope you don't see we later

32:21.880 --> 32:25.240
cos that'll be a stress-free
evening for fucking Turbo Tache."

32:26.720 --> 32:29.160
Tonight we're off to Florita's.
I can't wait.

32:29.240 --> 32:30.760
It's gonna be fucking mint.

32:30.840 --> 32:32.160
Let's get mortal.

32:32.240 --> 32:33.360
Whoo!

32:33.440 --> 32:37.640
To a good night. (all cheer)

32:39.280 --> 32:41.800
Me and the girls are so excited.

32:41.880 --> 32:43.880
Cocktails flowing.

32:46.040 --> 32:49.160
The Dick Detectives
are out in full force tonight.

32:49.240 --> 32:52.760
Me, Chloe and Chantelle
are all on the pull.

33:01.520 --> 33:05.480
It feels so nice to finally be able
to say, "No, I can't go on the pull.

33:05.560 --> 33:07.360
I've got a boyfriend."

33:07.440 --> 33:11.240
I'm single, Chloe's single,
Charlotte's single.

33:11.320 --> 33:13.920
Fuck Scott. I'm joining
the Dick Detectives.

33:14.680 --> 33:17.480
Lads, fuck the girls.
(chants) Fuck the girls.

33:17.560 --> 33:18.560
(all laugh)

33:18.640 --> 33:20.640
We look good
and we smell even better.

33:20.720 --> 33:23.360
It's time to hit the club
and get fucking mortal.

33:29.360 --> 33:33.800
Whoo! These girls pre-drinks
are getting wild.

33:36.920 --> 33:39.720
So, we walk into Florita's
and the girls are there.

33:39.800 --> 33:41.520
Hi! I didn't even see yous guys.

33:41.600 --> 33:44.480
To be honest, it is good to see them
in a good mood.

34:04.800 --> 34:07.520
It looks like the girls
are having way too much fun.

34:07.600 --> 34:09.440
It's time to play catch-up. Shots!

34:09.520 --> 34:11.840
Cheers!
Boys! Cheers!

34:19.680 --> 34:23.640
(laughs)Tonight I'm gonna show
Scott exactly what he's missing.

34:23.720 --> 34:25.760
I'm feeling good and I'm gonna pull

34:25.840 --> 34:29.240
right in front
of his shit, dopey face.

34:32.640 --> 34:35.160
Hang on a minute.
Is Chantelle going on the pull?

34:35.240 --> 34:37.840
The same thing she had a go
at Scott for last night.

34:37.920 --> 34:40.760
Double standards, mate.
Double fucking standards.

34:43.160 --> 34:46.480
The girls are off out on the pull
so that leaves me one job

34:46.560 --> 34:48.400
and that's to cock block the boys.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.880
I'm kinda flapping around
like a bird in front of them,

34:53.960 --> 34:55.680
hoping they can't see any girls.

34:58.640 --> 35:02.080
This is actually working,
I'm actually really good at this.

35:03.240 --> 35:05.000
I'm in the club trying to spy birds

35:05.080 --> 35:08.320
and Holly's trying to cock block me
by flailing in front of us.

35:08.400 --> 35:12.040
The last time I seen her dance like
that was on the end of my chopper.

35:15.760 --> 35:18.920
The newest member
of the Dick Detectives has pulled.

35:19.000 --> 35:21.720
It looks like Scott and Chantelle
are over, then.

35:25.960 --> 35:28.600
Chantelle's brought this lad
to make us jealous

35:28.680 --> 35:30.200
but the kid's pure lifting.

35:30.280 --> 35:33.320
He's got teeth coming out
of his fucking eyebrows.

35:35.040 --> 35:37.080
I told ya, Scott, from day one.

35:37.160 --> 35:40.240
Mug me off and I'll mug ya off
ten times worse.

35:40.320 --> 35:42.640
And this is me mugging you off.

35:42.720 --> 35:46.920
Chantelle's necking on with this
pure geek but I am not arsed at all.

35:47.000 --> 35:49.320
I'm more interested
in the fucking bench.

35:56.360 --> 35:58.960
We're all smashed.
Someone needs to get me home

35:59.040 --> 36:00.440
and get me some chicken.

36:00.520 --> 36:01.680
Let's go!

36:02.720 --> 36:05.200
This lad is canny
but I'm not bringing him home.

36:05.280 --> 36:08.760
I wanna stay with my girls tonight
so let's sip up and fuck off.

36:15.360 --> 36:17.320
Get back to the house
and to be honest,

36:17.400 --> 36:20.520
can't be arsed with any of the drama
so I'm off to bed.

36:21.640 --> 36:23.600
Chloe, are you stretching?

36:23.680 --> 36:25.600
Yeah.
What are you stretching for?

36:29.440 --> 36:32.760
Tonight I thought going on the pull
would make us feel better

36:32.840 --> 36:34.720
but it's made us feel
a lot worse.

36:34.800 --> 36:37.720
For some fucked up reason,
I'm still gutted over Scott

36:37.800 --> 36:41.400
and the only thing I wanna do is
speak to him and tell him how I feel.

36:44.200 --> 36:47.520
So, Scott.I'm lying in bed,
minding my own business

36:47.600 --> 36:48.960
and Chantelle walks in.

36:49.040 --> 36:50.360
I just wanna let you know

36:50.440 --> 36:53.320
you disrespected us so much
it's unbelievable.

36:53.400 --> 36:55.720
If you tell me
you just wanna be friends,

36:55.800 --> 36:57.560
what do you expect me to do?

36:57.640 --> 36:59.920
It's obvious
tonight her plan backfired.

37:00.000 --> 37:01.720
You hurt me.

37:03.320 --> 37:05.480
You made us feel like a dick.
I haven't.

37:05.560 --> 37:09.080
Now Chantelle is in tears
and to be honest, I feel proper bad.

37:09.160 --> 37:12.120
The fact that I just...
No, I don't wanna cuddle ya.

37:12.200 --> 37:13.760
I don't wanna be your friend.

37:13.840 --> 37:15.600
All I wanna do is give her a cuddle.

37:15.680 --> 37:18.680
The fact that I just... I don't know.

37:18.760 --> 37:21.560
Chantelle. Chantelle.
Whatever.

37:21.640 --> 37:24.080
I'm so happy that's not me any more.
So happy.

37:24.160 --> 37:27.480
You've made us look like a dick.
You've not shown any interest

37:27.560 --> 37:31.000
and I told ya I was sporting ya
and said I wanted to be your friend

37:31.080 --> 37:34.760
but I just wanted to go on.
You pulled on the next day.

37:34.840 --> 37:38.520
You are not getting you've hurt me.
Can't sit here any longer.

37:38.600 --> 37:43.200
I'm, like, an emotional wreck.
Just wanna get out and go downstairs.

37:43.280 --> 37:46.840
Aaron says he just wanted to shag me,
never liked me from the start.

37:46.920 --> 37:48.440
Still my fault, I suppose.

37:48.520 --> 37:51.840
Chantelle comes down and starts
screaming accusations at us.

37:51.920 --> 37:53.760
What the fuck is her problem?

37:53.840 --> 37:56.840
You said he never liked us
but he's telling me different.

37:56.920 --> 37:59.640
He's always liked me.
I said he never liked you?

37:59.720 --> 38:03.520
I'm feeling like absolute shit here
and he's just adding to the problem.

38:03.600 --> 38:06.360
Fuck off, will ya, Aaron?
I said Scott does not care.

38:06.440 --> 38:09.560
About me?No, no.
I said Scott does not care -

38:09.640 --> 38:12.400
There you go, thank you very much.

38:12.480 --> 38:15.200
I'm sick to death of being blamed
for everything.

38:16.200 --> 38:18.800
It's time we sort this shit out
once and for all.

38:18.880 --> 38:22.240
Chantelle, come here.I will sit
with you and Scott, no problem.

38:22.320 --> 38:25.320
Let's have a chat.He's got
your back, you've got his now.

38:25.400 --> 38:28.240
Calm down. You sit on that bed.
I'll sit here.

38:28.320 --> 38:30.320
Sit down.Get up, Scott.

38:30.400 --> 38:32.840
Let me lay down what you've said
about Scott.

38:32.920 --> 38:35.640
Let me lay it all out
what you've said about Scott.

38:35.720 --> 38:38.160
Cos you can't say shit.
Lay it down, babe.

38:38.240 --> 38:39.520
I was wondering how long

38:39.600 --> 38:42.280
that emotional time with Chantelle
was gonna last

38:42.360 --> 38:46.160
because now we're back to angry time
and she is fucking booting off.

38:46.240 --> 38:50.000
You're a fucking liar. You are
a fucking liar.I don't lie.

38:50.080 --> 38:53.040
You... And you know
I'm telling the truth.

38:53.120 --> 38:55.520
Aaron is talking absolute shit

38:55.600 --> 38:57.880
and the first thing I see
is a water bottle.

38:57.960 --> 39:00.240
You fuck -
All I said, Chantelle -

39:00.320 --> 39:01.760
(glass smashes)
I see red.

39:01.840 --> 39:04.000
I just wanna fucking launch it.
Fuck you!

39:04.080 --> 39:06.960
Made me look a fucking mug.
I didn't say he didn't care.

39:07.040 --> 39:10.440
You said he didn't give a fuck
about me.No, I said he didn't care.

39:10.520 --> 39:12.160
I've had enough. I'm going in.

39:12.240 --> 39:13.760
I mean it. Shut up.
Listen.

39:13.840 --> 39:16.640
I don't want any more kick-offs.

39:16.720 --> 39:18.600
Everyone in the room is kicking off.

39:18.680 --> 39:21.000
I wish they would do one
cos I wanna sleep.

39:21.080 --> 39:24.360
What do you want? What do you want?

39:24.440 --> 39:28.560
Because we can't go backwards
and forwards any more.

39:28.640 --> 39:31.320
I can't sit here any longer.
I'm getting too upset.

39:33.440 --> 39:34.600
Again.

39:34.680 --> 39:37.120
(Gaz babbles)

39:37.200 --> 39:39.440
You haven't been in this house
that long.

39:39.520 --> 39:43.360
I know.You don't know people
for who they really are just yet.

39:43.440 --> 39:45.880
I thought Chantelle
was just massively angry

39:45.960 --> 39:47.680
about every single situation

39:47.760 --> 39:50.240
but actually,
I think that was just masking

39:50.320 --> 39:52.520
how upset and hurt she actually is.

39:52.600 --> 39:55.920
Scott is the main issue here.
That's why you're angry at Aaron,

39:56.000 --> 40:00.080
because of Scott.
You. Prick-face.

40:00.160 --> 40:02.400
I want an apology.
I'm sorry.

40:02.480 --> 40:05.680
I'm finally all settled in bed
and then Chloe waltzes in.

40:05.760 --> 40:08.680
What the fuck is going on
with everyone in this house?

40:09.640 --> 40:13.320
(kisses) I'm absolutely mortal
and I'm in Scott's room.

40:13.400 --> 40:15.720
But what's a little kiss
between friends?

40:18.360 --> 40:20.560
What's a little hand
between friends?

40:22.520 --> 40:26.480
(laughs) What's a little...
between friends?

40:31.840 --> 40:34.520
Let's go to bed.
Let's forget about this tonight

40:34.600 --> 40:37.520
and start tomorrow a new day.
Charlotte's been great.

40:37.600 --> 40:40.560
The last person I wanna argue with
is the girls.

40:42.360 --> 40:44.400
In fact, all the girls
have been great.

40:44.480 --> 40:48.000
Charlotte, Holly and Chloe.
I'm so grateful they've got my back.

40:48.080 --> 40:50.040
Chloe.
Chloe.

40:50.120 --> 40:52.880
Chloe. There you go, darling.

40:52.960 --> 40:54.960
Scott, someone's coming.

40:57.080 --> 41:00.200
I've cooked you chicken nuggets.
Where have you just been?

41:00.280 --> 41:03.240
What the fuck have you been up to,
you little shit?

41:04.240 --> 41:07.240
Sorry, Chantelle.
I did tell ya Scott was mine.

41:07.320 --> 41:09.960
Unlucky, kid. (laughs)

41:13.600 --> 41:17.120
I know you
like the back of my fucking hand.

41:17.200 --> 41:20.240
And your face there,
when you walked out of there,

41:20.320 --> 41:23.160
told me 1,000 fucking stories.

41:24.840 --> 41:26.880
I've always seen Scott as mine.

41:33.160 --> 41:36.200
I got there first
so I'm not breaking any girl code.

41:36.280 --> 41:38.120
Do you feel bad?
Not any more.

41:38.200 --> 41:40.000
He's mine.
He's always been mine.

41:40.080 --> 41:45.000
Oh, my fucking God. What the hell?!

41:47.440 --> 41:50.880
Everyone, to the shelter
cos when this bomb gets dropped,

41:50.960 --> 41:53.800
no-one is gonna wanna be around.
I'm off to bed.

41:54.520 --> 41:54.720
.
