WEBVTT

00:02.350 --> 00:03.351
[Mike] Previously on "Mike & Molly.."

00:03.438 --> 00:05.440
Dad?

00:05.527 --> 00:07.007
[Molly]
'You might wanna
steer clear of my house.'

00:07.094 --> 00:09.966
Your ex is in town
and he's staying with us.

00:10.053 --> 00:11.576
So Jack's here?

00:11.663 --> 00:13.143
I'm guessing I'll be spending
most of the reception

00:13.230 --> 00:14.579
trying to keep my mom's foot

00:14.666 --> 00:16.842
out of my dad's ass.

00:16.929 --> 00:19.149
Well, this is my wedding,
and that means that nobody

00:19.236 --> 00:20.803
gets to be crazier than me.

00:20.890 --> 00:22.718
Looks like we might need
to let this out just a smidge.

00:22.805 --> 00:26.069
No you won't, I am just a few
pounds from my target weight

00:26.156 --> 00:27.462
and I am gonna drop
those last six pounds

00:27.549 --> 00:28.811
easy peasy, lemon squeezy.

00:28.898 --> 00:30.595
Those six pounds
will be your bitch.

00:30.682 --> 00:32.771
Remember not to stay
in the saddle the whole time.

00:32.858 --> 00:35.905
Move up and down
and lift with your core.

00:35.992 --> 00:39.604
- Molly!
- Mike!

00:39.691 --> 00:42.825
Listen, you don't have to
squeeze into some wedding dress

00:42.912 --> 00:44.609
to look perfect to me.

00:44.696 --> 00:47.047
You're already the most
beautiful woman in the world.

00:48.657 --> 00:50.789
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

00:52.574 --> 00:55.229
- I love you, Christina.
- Aw.

00:55.316 --> 00:56.882
That's sweet.

00:58.971 --> 01:00.625
I told that woman I loved her,
laid my heart out

01:00.712 --> 01:01.713
in front of her
and she chopped it up

01:01.800 --> 01:02.801
like we were at Benihana's.

01:02.888 --> 01:04.151
Maybe she didn't hear you.

01:04.238 --> 01:06.153
Please! The whole
restaurant heard me.

01:06.240 --> 01:07.850
The busboy gave me a hug
on the way out.

01:07.937 --> 01:09.330
I don't think Vince
and I are too old

01:09.417 --> 01:11.462
for a traditional
wedding, do you?

01:11.549 --> 01:13.595
[Vince]
You need to tell
your mom to back off.

01:13.682 --> 01:15.814
I don't know why she's been
getting so wedding-crazy lately.

01:15.901 --> 01:17.207
Just tell her.

01:17.294 --> 01:19.427
How can I tell my fiance
I'm still married?

01:20.776 --> 01:23.170
- What?
- You son of a bitch.

01:23.257 --> 01:24.258
[Molly]
'Mom!'

01:24.345 --> 01:25.737
I'm not signing anything

01:25.824 --> 01:28.827
till he pays me
the ten grand he owes me.

01:28.914 --> 01:30.438
- Would you take $3,000?
- Eight!

01:30.525 --> 01:32.004
Five, and you can
kick him in the nuts again.

01:32.092 --> 01:33.310
Deal!

01:33.397 --> 01:34.964
I hope you know
what you're doing

01:35.051 --> 01:37.662
marrying into a crazy
family like that.

01:37.749 --> 01:40.361
[Jack]
'Margaret,
you coming back to bed?'

01:43.103 --> 01:45.322
Oh. Hey, boy.
I didn't hear you come in.

01:45.409 --> 01:47.585
[instrumental music]

01:51.502 --> 01:53.896
[Peggy]
'Hey, there's
the handsome bridegroom.'

01:53.983 --> 01:56.203
I hope your dad and I didn't
keep you awake last night

01:56.290 --> 01:58.640
with our rambunctious
slap and tickle.

02:01.033 --> 02:02.600
No, I put cotton balls
in my ears

02:02.687 --> 02:04.036
and then a pillow over my head

02:04.124 --> 02:05.603
and then wrapped
the whole thing with duct tape.

02:07.214 --> 02:09.694
- Is dad still here?
- Sacked out upstairs.

02:09.781 --> 02:11.218
I'm afraid I didn't
let your pappy

02:11.305 --> 02:13.045
get much shut-eye last night.

02:13.133 --> 02:14.569
Yeah, it was about 2:00 a.m.
when I realized

02:14.656 --> 02:16.048
the cotton balls weren't enough

02:16.136 --> 02:17.963
and I didn't have
the stomach to cut off my ears.

02:19.487 --> 02:22.185
Your dad and I never had
any problems carnally.

02:22.272 --> 02:24.274
We could fight all day
and settle it that night

02:24.361 --> 02:27.234
buck naked between the sheets.

02:27.321 --> 02:30.672
You know, that's how
you got that ten-speed.

02:30.759 --> 02:31.803
Why'd you have to tell me that?

02:31.890 --> 02:34.502
I loved that bike.

02:34.589 --> 02:36.852
Hate is a powerful aphrodisiac.

02:36.939 --> 02:38.984
People say,
never go to bed angry.

02:39.071 --> 02:42.162
They don't know what the hell
they're missing.

02:42.249 --> 02:43.685
Look, I don't know
what you and dad are doing

02:43.772 --> 02:45.077
but I just don't wanna
see you get hurt again.

02:45.165 --> 02:46.514
Don't worry about me.

02:46.601 --> 02:48.342
I'm pretty thick-skinned
even though I come off

02:48.429 --> 02:50.170
like a dainty flower.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.393
I know, buddy.

02:56.480 --> 02:58.743
I'm just as scared as you are.

02:58.830 --> 03:00.832
♪ For the first time ♪

03:00.919 --> 03:03.139
♪ In my life ♪

03:04.358 --> 03:06.795
♪ I see love ♪♪

03:18.937 --> 03:20.200
Here you are, my pet.

03:20.287 --> 03:22.854
Fresh-squeezed O.J.
and Italian champagne.

03:22.941 --> 03:25.596
Tastes the same,
but it's like, 30 bucks cheaper.

03:27.294 --> 03:29.513
I see, so you and me
gotta cut corners

03:29.600 --> 03:32.168
'cause you lost your shirt
in last night's quickie divorce?

03:32.255 --> 03:34.866
See? I knew you'd understand!

03:37.173 --> 03:38.435
Okay.

03:38.522 --> 03:41.569
There was a little
snafu at the hair salon

03:41.656 --> 03:43.266
but it's gonna be fine.

03:48.663 --> 03:49.968
[sobbing]

03:51.883 --> 03:55.452
Snafu? That's Dolly Parton
and Yentl having a hair baby.

03:57.280 --> 03:59.674
This is not what I wanted.
I wanted to look beautiful.

03:59.761 --> 04:01.980
This is not beautiful!

04:03.591 --> 04:04.983
Sweetie, it's gonna be fine.

04:05.070 --> 04:06.855
This is just
a little speed bump.

04:06.942 --> 04:08.857
This is a 12-car pile-up.

04:10.641 --> 04:13.035
I'm surprised there's not
a news chopper overhead.

04:13.122 --> 04:14.384
Vince!

04:14.471 --> 04:16.691
He's right, it's horrible.

04:16.778 --> 04:19.433
I told them I wanted soft
ringlets around my face

04:19.520 --> 04:23.175
not a head full of curly fries.

04:23.263 --> 04:25.656
Oh, it's not that bad.

04:25.743 --> 04:28.398
I-It's just a little busy.

04:28.485 --> 04:30.879
And Mike loves curly fries.

04:33.882 --> 04:34.796
Didn't they try and fix it?

04:34.883 --> 04:36.319
This is the fix.

04:36.406 --> 04:37.842
I had to get her out of there
before they started

04:37.929 --> 04:40.280
adding sparklers
and little fake birds.

04:41.455 --> 04:42.717
Somebody call Mike and tell him

04:42.804 --> 04:44.240
he's marrying a circus clown.

04:44.327 --> 04:46.547
I'm gonna go put on
my big, red nose now!

04:48.331 --> 04:50.594
[instrumental music]

04:53.771 --> 04:55.469
Geez, what a horrible night.

04:55.556 --> 04:57.993
The sound of my parents'
sweaty bodies slapping together.

04:58.080 --> 05:00.648
It was like Satan
clapping his hands.

05:00.735 --> 05:02.824
Yeah, when my grandma
has Brother Heywood over

05:02.911 --> 05:04.608
I just take a sleeping bag
into the garage

05:04.695 --> 05:06.393
and lay under the car.

05:06.480 --> 05:07.872
I'd rather wake up
with a mouthful of oil

05:07.959 --> 05:10.484
than hear that mess.

05:10.571 --> 05:11.746
I just don't need
any more drama.

05:11.833 --> 05:13.400
I got enough on my mind today.

05:13.487 --> 05:15.097
Well, don't worry about
Christina and me.

05:15.184 --> 05:17.752
I've put that unrequited
I-love-you incident behind me.

05:17.839 --> 05:19.014
Good, once you step in it

05:19.101 --> 05:20.668
don't try and dig it out
of the treads.

05:20.755 --> 05:23.540
Best to just throw the shoe out.

05:23.627 --> 05:26.238
Agreed, and after the initial
sting of public humiliation

05:26.326 --> 05:28.502
I realized that these things
have to move at their own pace.

05:28.589 --> 05:30.547
- Let it unfold naturally.
- Mm-hm.

05:30.634 --> 05:32.506
So, today,
when I ask her to marry me

05:32.593 --> 05:34.159
she has no choice
but to say "I love you."

05:34.246 --> 05:35.291
What?

05:35.378 --> 05:36.640
Ow!

05:38.642 --> 05:39.817
[Molly]
'Let me look, let me look!'

05:39.904 --> 05:41.515
[Victoria]
'No, I'm not done yet!'

05:41.602 --> 05:42.690
[Molly]
'I wanna see it!
Give me the mirror!'

05:42.777 --> 05:44.431
- 'No!'
- 'I need to see it!'

05:44.518 --> 05:46.128
It's my hair
and I wanna look!

05:46.215 --> 05:47.521
Sweetie, you gotta
trust me on this

05:47.608 --> 05:49.000
it's not ready to be seen.

05:49.087 --> 05:50.524
- 'Give me the toaster!'
- 'No!'

05:50.611 --> 05:52.830
[Molly]
'Fine, I'll get a spoon.'

05:52.917 --> 05:54.963
Oh, my God, I'm hideous.

05:55.050 --> 05:57.182
Honey, nobody looks
their best in a big spoon.

05:57.269 --> 05:58.619
[Molly]
'That's it,
I'm shaving my head!'

05:58.706 --> 05:59.881
[Victoria]
'You'll look just like Mike.'

05:59.968 --> 06:01.404
'You're gonna
confuse everybody.'

06:02.927 --> 06:05.190
[instrumental music]

06:07.758 --> 06:09.281
Carl, if you tell a woman
you love her

06:09.369 --> 06:10.848
and she doesn't say it back

06:10.935 --> 06:13.373
you don't follow up with,
"Will you marry me?"

06:13.460 --> 06:14.809
Why not?

06:14.896 --> 06:16.376
It's like, if she doesn't
wanna kiss you

06:16.463 --> 06:18.116
you don't take your pants off.

06:20.162 --> 06:22.643
Did she tell you about that?

06:22.730 --> 06:25.297
Hey, I sat in gum.

06:25.385 --> 06:27.865
Besides, I'll never get
a better proposal opportunity.

06:27.952 --> 06:29.650
I'm wearing a tuxedo,
love is in the air

06:29.737 --> 06:30.694
and I'll have
a microphone in my hand.

06:30.781 --> 06:32.479
Wait, what?

06:32.566 --> 06:34.611
I'm doing it at the reception
during my best man toast.

06:34.698 --> 06:37.092
- No, you're not!
- It'll be perfect.

06:37.179 --> 06:38.876
I'll say some lovely words
about you and Molly

06:38.963 --> 06:40.225
then turn to Christina

06:40.312 --> 06:42.619
and ask her to be my wife.

06:42.706 --> 06:45.666
Carl..

06:45.753 --> 06:47.319
...remember that awkward moment
at dinner

06:47.407 --> 06:48.451
when your "I love you"
was followed

06:48.538 --> 06:50.801
by a black hole
of silence, crickets

06:50.888 --> 06:53.848
and a sagebrush tumbling
through the restaurant?

06:53.935 --> 06:55.719
- Yes.
- Okay.

06:55.806 --> 06:57.329
Now, add a microphone to that

06:57.417 --> 06:59.331
about a 150 friends
and family and me

06:59.419 --> 07:01.595
hitting you in the head
with a chair.

07:02.596 --> 07:03.945
Are you boys decent?

07:04.032 --> 07:06.208
I just wanted to see
how Michael was holding up.

07:06.295 --> 07:07.731
Nana, Carl's trying
to ruin my wedding!

07:07.818 --> 07:08.950
Leave her out of this!

07:09.037 --> 07:12.954
What did you do now,
Knucklehead Jones?

07:13.041 --> 07:14.695
He's gonna propose to Christina
during my reception

07:14.782 --> 07:16.174
and she doesn't even love him.

07:16.261 --> 07:18.133
She does, too,
but she's afraid to say it.

07:18.220 --> 07:20.701
I just need to put some more
cheese on the mousetrap.

07:20.788 --> 07:22.529
You're proposing
to that poor woman?

07:22.616 --> 07:25.270
Is that why my nice jade ring
has gone missing?

07:25.357 --> 07:29.187
- But you said I could have it.
- After I'm dead!

07:29.274 --> 07:31.363
But if you keep stealing stuff
out of my bedroom

07:31.451 --> 07:33.888
I swear, it will be
your funeral and my trial.

07:36.238 --> 07:38.545
What do you mean
your limo has been towed?

07:38.632 --> 07:42.026
I thought you guys could park
anywhere, like ambulances.

07:42.113 --> 07:44.464
You did, too?

07:44.551 --> 07:45.813
[Molly]
'Okay, I'm coming down.'

07:45.900 --> 07:46.857
Gotta go.

07:46.944 --> 07:49.120
Ready.

07:52.210 --> 07:54.474
Wow!

07:54.561 --> 07:56.345
Look at you.

07:56.432 --> 07:58.347
- Is it okay?
- Oh.

07:58.434 --> 08:01.219
Just beautiful.

08:01.306 --> 08:03.091
Perfect.

08:03.178 --> 08:04.962
Thank you for holding it
together for me.

08:05.049 --> 08:07.704
I don't know what I would
have done without you.

08:07.791 --> 08:09.706
Probably still be
at that hair salon

08:09.793 --> 08:13.188
throwing curlers
at that beautician.

08:13.275 --> 08:17.148
Did I really do that?
I have no memory of that.

08:17.235 --> 08:20.238
You did inhale about
two cans of hairspray, so..

08:23.503 --> 08:25.330
Is the limo here yet?

08:26.506 --> 08:28.508
Wanna hear a funny story?

08:33.164 --> 08:34.426
Don't worry, Mol.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.254
We're on our way to the church

08:36.341 --> 08:38.866
and everything is gonna be fine.

08:39.910 --> 08:41.521
[engine sputtering]

08:45.437 --> 08:47.962
You're probably not
in the mood to push, are you?

08:50.138 --> 08:52.575
I'm sorry.

08:59.495 --> 09:01.062
Carl, I'm beggin' you,
don't ask Christina

09:01.149 --> 09:02.237
to marry you at my reception.

09:02.324 --> 09:03.717
Do anything else
you want to ruin it.

09:03.804 --> 09:06.241
Get drunk, cannonball
into the wedding cake

09:06.328 --> 09:07.459
have the DJ play "Thriller"

09:07.547 --> 09:09.636
do your zombie dance.

09:09.723 --> 09:10.941
How about I pop the question
after you guys

09:11.028 --> 09:12.508
pull away in the limo?

09:12.595 --> 09:14.292
Delightful, as long as you can
see the back of my head

09:14.379 --> 09:15.380
you can humiliate yourself

09:15.467 --> 09:17.208
and everyone around you.

09:17.295 --> 09:19.776
I can't believe you don't want
to witness the disaster.

09:19.863 --> 09:20.821
Video it with your cell phone.

09:20.908 --> 09:22.300
Well, that is a given.

09:22.387 --> 09:23.954
My only question is,
when I put it on YouTube

09:24.041 --> 09:26.827
should I add a car crash
or a wah-wah-wah?

09:28.698 --> 09:31.005
Hey, fellas,
how's everything going in here?

09:31.092 --> 09:33.398
Uh, fine, dad.
Can I talk to you for a second?

09:33.485 --> 09:34.878
Sure.

09:34.965 --> 09:36.967
Alright, what's going on
with you and mom?

09:37.054 --> 09:39.491
We're getting along,
enjoying each other's company.

09:39.579 --> 09:40.797
Isn't that what you wanted?

09:40.884 --> 09:42.233
What I heard through
the walls last night

09:42.320 --> 09:44.279
is nothing close
to what I wanted.

09:44.366 --> 09:45.585
So what, you're just
gonna leave your wife

09:45.672 --> 09:46.977
and move back with mom?

09:47.064 --> 09:48.936
Kind of romantic, huh?

09:49.023 --> 09:51.155
Like one of those movies
where the couple realizes

09:51.242 --> 09:52.809
they were always meant
to be together.

09:52.896 --> 09:55.116
See, I was thinking more
"Friday The 13th" or "Saw"

09:55.203 --> 09:58.859
where you cut off your own arm
to escape the pain.

09:58.946 --> 10:00.730
Alright, buddy,
let's go over your vows.

10:00.817 --> 10:02.427
We'll see you
in the church, Mr. Biggs.

10:02.514 --> 10:05.430
Have a boutonniere.

10:05.517 --> 10:06.693
Thanks for pulling me
out of there.

10:06.780 --> 10:08.303
I was gonna lose it.

10:08.390 --> 10:09.652
I mean, he walks out
on the two of us

10:09.739 --> 10:10.697
and 20 years later
thinks he can pick up

10:10.784 --> 10:12.307
right where he left off.

10:12.394 --> 10:16.267
Let it go. This day is about
you, Molly, and nobody else.

10:16.354 --> 10:18.792
Hey, Mike, sorry to bother you
but have you heard from Molly?

10:18.879 --> 10:20.097
She's not here yet,
we're startin' to get

10:20.184 --> 10:21.359
a little worried about her.

10:21.446 --> 10:23.187
- What? She's not here?
- Just breathe.

10:23.274 --> 10:25.537
Everything's gonna be fine.
She will be here.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.496
Christina, will you marry me?

10:31.369 --> 10:33.502
Wah-wah-wah.

10:39.029 --> 10:41.684
[Victoria]
Hello? Hello?

10:41.771 --> 10:43.120
Anyone?

10:43.207 --> 10:44.556
I got no bars.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.646
- That's the battery!
- Oh.

10:46.733 --> 10:48.691
I got no battery.

10:48.778 --> 10:49.823
Can I borrow your phone?

10:49.910 --> 10:51.259
Yeah, it's in my back pocket.

10:51.346 --> 10:54.088
- You don't have any pockets.
- Exactly.

10:54.175 --> 10:55.567
Excuse me, sir.

10:55.655 --> 10:58.440
Can we borrow your cell phone?

10:58.527 --> 11:00.790
Victoria, I don't think
he has a phone.

11:00.877 --> 11:02.096
Here you go.

11:02.183 --> 11:04.141
But I think we might be
in a dead spot.

11:05.969 --> 11:09.364
Come on, it's bad luck for
a bride to miss her own wedding.

11:09.451 --> 11:10.974
Hang on a second,
I think I have a friend

11:11.061 --> 11:12.280
who lives in this neighborhood.

11:12.367 --> 11:13.803
You're kidding.

11:13.890 --> 11:16.501
What is he, a bail bondsman
or a drug dealer?

11:16.588 --> 11:18.286
Well, he's not a bail bondsman.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.072
Any sign of Molly yet?

11:22.159 --> 11:24.031
No, but everything else
is under control.

11:24.118 --> 11:25.728
Flynns on the left,
Biggs on the right.

11:25.815 --> 11:28.775
Did you know that you both have
aunts that look like uncles?

11:31.168 --> 11:32.300
Oh, my Aunt Frida made it?

11:32.387 --> 11:33.693
He did.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.522
So you don't love me
and you don't wanna marry me?

11:37.609 --> 11:40.134
Carl, this is not the time
or the place.

11:40.221 --> 11:42.136
Why do you let me
do these things?

11:43.790 --> 11:45.356
This will cut together
beautifully!

11:47.663 --> 11:49.143
Hey, have you heard
anything from Molly?

11:49.230 --> 11:51.449
I'm sure everything's fine.
We left her with Victoria.

11:51.536 --> 11:52.973
Mrs. Flynn, no disrespect,
but you know

11:53.060 --> 11:54.888
those two sentences
don't go together.

11:54.975 --> 11:57.107
Yeah, even as I said it,
I wasn't buying it.

11:58.630 --> 12:01.111
Listen, since your bride
is a no-show

12:01.198 --> 12:02.852
what do you say
Joyce and I step in?

12:02.939 --> 12:04.941
I'm not lettin' you have
my wedding, Vince.

12:05.028 --> 12:07.335
Come on, If I don't marry
that crazy broad right away

12:07.422 --> 12:10.164
she's gonna ruin my life!

12:10.251 --> 12:11.731
- No deal.
- Fine!

12:11.818 --> 12:13.776
I'm taking back
my popcorn popper.

12:17.214 --> 12:19.260
Molly!

12:21.001 --> 12:22.872
[instrumental music]

12:26.310 --> 12:29.009
Is it just me or does your car
smell like French fries?

12:29.096 --> 12:31.315
This vehicle's a 100% biodiesel.

12:31.402 --> 12:32.839
That's the corn oil
you're smelling.

12:32.926 --> 12:34.841
- Corn oil?
- Yeah.

12:34.928 --> 12:36.973
One of my customers
manages a McDonald's

12:37.060 --> 12:39.236
and we've worked out
kind of a barter system.

12:39.323 --> 12:41.891
I keep him in weed, and he
keeps me in cooking grease

12:41.978 --> 12:43.980
and those tasty
little apple pies.

12:45.547 --> 12:47.331
Oh, I love those things.

12:47.418 --> 12:49.246
- Do we have time to stop?
- No!

12:49.333 --> 12:51.161
I am a half an hour
late for my wedding.

12:51.248 --> 12:53.598
Does this car go faster
than four miles per hour?

12:53.685 --> 12:56.123
Not if you care
about the earth it doesn't.

12:57.515 --> 12:59.822
Screw the earth
and hit the gas, hippie!

13:01.955 --> 13:03.478
Wow, your sister's
kind of a buzzkill.

- I don't know.

Oh, yeah.

15:26.316 --> 15:27.491
Jack, I've been waiting

15:27.578 --> 15:29.276
20 years to tell you this.

15:29.363 --> 15:31.278
I'm dumpin' you.

15:32.496 --> 15:33.802
What? I don't understand.

15:33.889 --> 15:35.804
I thought last night
we found our old spark.

15:35.891 --> 15:38.285
Nope, that was a little
taste of the sweet nectar

15:38.372 --> 15:40.374
you dumped down the drain
20 years ago.

15:40.461 --> 15:42.898
Now, take that and those
hairless white legs of yours

15:42.985 --> 15:45.683
back to Florida and your whore.

15:45.770 --> 15:47.642
So you did all this
to set me up

15:47.729 --> 15:49.165
and then break my heart?

15:49.252 --> 15:51.211
Well, I was hopin'
your ticker would blow up

15:51.298 --> 15:52.908
while you were doing
your dirty business

16:13.711 --> 16:15.104
Some big load like me
was actually gonna marry

16:15.191 --> 16:16.627
that beautiful princess?

16:16.714 --> 16:17.672
Alright, she's gonna
be here, she loves you.

16:17.759 --> 16:19.108
She wised up just in time

16:19.195 --> 16:20.805
and realized
she could do a lot better.

16:20.892 --> 16:22.198
Did you skip breakfast?

16:22.285 --> 16:24.331
- Somebody got a snickers bar?
- Yes.

16:26.594 --> 16:27.812
All my life,
I've been dreaming

16:27.899 --> 16:29.771
about a woman like her.

16:29.858 --> 16:32.861
Maybe that's all this is,
it's just a dream.

16:32.948 --> 16:33.905
You're not supposed to get

16:33.993 --> 16:35.168
everything you want in life.

16:35.255 --> 16:36.996
Why not? I did.

16:40.347 --> 16:42.131
Where the hell have you been?

16:44.699 --> 16:46.396
Don't ever leave me alone again.

16:46.483 --> 16:48.790
This has been the worst
24 hours of my life.

16:48.877 --> 16:51.010
Yeah, It hasn't exactly been

16:51.097 --> 16:52.620
a walk in the park
for me, either.

16:52.707 --> 16:55.405
Although we did walk
through a very scary park.

16:58.365 --> 17:00.280
Do you wanna get married?

17:00.367 --> 17:02.673
I do, I really do.

17:02.760 --> 17:04.284
And if I get hit by lightning

17:04.371 --> 17:06.329
between here and the altar

17:06.416 --> 17:07.765
which, based on the day
I've been having

17:07.852 --> 17:09.028
could actually happen.

17:10.420 --> 17:11.900
I just want you to know that

17:11.987 --> 17:13.815
you are the love of my life.

17:15.121 --> 17:16.557
Right back at you.

17:18.341 --> 17:20.387
By the way, you smell amazing.

17:21.866 --> 17:23.390
