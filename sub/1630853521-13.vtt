00:01.392 --> 00:03.090
<i>Previously on</i> All Rise...

00:03.090 --> 00:05.657
I want you to know this little
war of ours is far from over.

00:05.657 --> 00:07.224
Drop the gun!

00:07.224 --> 00:09.226
- I love you, Em.
- I love you, too.

00:09.226 --> 00:10.923
We were a thing, like,
a million years ago.

00:10.923 --> 00:12.229
You two were more than a thing.

00:12.229 --> 00:13.491
I've got you, Lo.

00:14.623 --> 00:16.668
I saw you and Andre.

00:16.668 --> 00:18.322
Can we just talk about this, please?

00:18.322 --> 00:19.758
I need some time.

00:22.109 --> 00:24.981
My brother is not a murderer.

00:24.981 --> 00:27.462
- I take it you saw the news?
- It can't be a coincidence.

00:27.462 --> 00:30.247
You think we have a serial
killer on our hands?

00:33.859 --> 00:35.426
Police arrested
a man they believe

00:35.426 --> 00:36.601
is a serial killer.

00:36.601 --> 00:38.647
Long-time South L.A.

00:38.647 --> 00:40.823
forklift operator, Carl Brewer,
did not resist arrest.

00:40.823 --> 00:42.738
He barely said a word
as police took him away.

00:42.738 --> 00:45.132
Brewer is accused
of murdering four women

00:45.132 --> 00:47.177
between 2004 and 2017.

00:47.177 --> 00:49.571
Earlier this year,
Brewer was acquitted

00:49.571 --> 00:51.442
in the murder of one
South L.A. woman.

00:51.442 --> 00:53.314
He is now charged
in the brutal deaths

00:53.314 --> 00:54.837
of four additional women.

00:54.837 --> 00:56.621
All of the victims
shot to death.

00:56.621 --> 00:59.102
Their bodies
found in alleys and landfills.

00:59.102 --> 01:00.799
Brewer says
he's innocent, but prosecutors

01:00.799 --> 01:02.584
maintain they've collected
new evidence against him

01:02.584 --> 01:04.542
over the past few months.

01:04.542 --> 01:06.414
They said he may
have committed other murders

01:06.414 --> 01:08.111
<i>that have gone
unsolved for a years.</i>

01:08.111 --> 01:09.678
<i>The question on everyone's mind,</i>

01:09.678 --> 01:11.897
<i>will Carl Brewer
be acquitted once again?</i>

01:11.897 --> 01:14.422
<i>A new set of jurors will decide.</i>

01:15.684 --> 01:17.773
Big day. You ready?

01:17.773 --> 01:19.731
Yeah. Yeah, hell, yeah.

01:19.731 --> 01:22.299
Always down to put
a serial killer behind bars,

01:22.299 --> 01:25.259
especially a creep
like Carl Brewer.

01:25.259 --> 01:27.783
I don't know.
I have this sneaking suspicion

01:27.783 --> 01:29.524
he's got another trick up
his sleeve.

01:29.524 --> 01:31.178
You've built a rock-solid case.

01:31.178 --> 01:33.005
Now, you've just got
to convince a jury.

01:36.879 --> 01:38.141
Yeah.

01:44.147 --> 01:45.975
Don't look so surprised,

01:45.975 --> 01:47.803
I've been known to make
breakfast from time to time.

01:51.720 --> 01:52.982
I'm not complaining.

01:54.462 --> 01:56.507
All that tossing and turning
you were doing last night.

01:56.507 --> 01:59.249
That's what a crying baby
will do to you.

01:59.249 --> 02:00.903
You, my dear, were comatose.

02:00.903 --> 02:02.557
I was tired after that flight.

02:02.557 --> 02:05.386
Thank you for taking care
of Bailey,

02:05.386 --> 02:07.736
I mean, with you having
to get up early and everything.

02:09.216 --> 02:11.305
Funny thing happened
after you drifted off

02:11.305 --> 02:12.915
to Never Neverland.

02:12.915 --> 02:15.613
I couldn't sleep.

02:15.613 --> 02:18.921
So, I go to cast a movie
from my husband's cell phone.

02:18.921 --> 02:21.576
Let me guess.
<i>Love and Basketball?</i>

02:21.576 --> 02:23.317
It never gets old.

02:23.317 --> 02:26.276
Anyway, I'm all thumbs
with your phone as usual.

02:26.276 --> 02:28.322
And instead of my movie,

02:28.322 --> 02:32.064
I get my husband's emails
splashed across the TV screen.

02:32.064 --> 02:33.675
No biggie.

02:33.675 --> 02:37.331
Until I come across
one particular email

02:37.331 --> 02:41.422
with the subject line,
"Operation Double A,"

02:41.422 --> 02:43.772
- a.k.a. Andre Armstrong.
- Here we go.

02:43.772 --> 02:46.427
You're running a background
check on Andre, Robin, really?

02:46.427 --> 02:49.038
It's not an FBI thing.

02:49.038 --> 02:51.083
I just want to know
a little more

02:51.083 --> 02:52.781
about the man
I saw kissing my wife.

02:52.781 --> 02:56.132
It was a huge mistake
and I am sorry.

02:56.132 --> 02:57.873
And I will continue
to say I'm sorry.

02:57.873 --> 03:00.397
Lola, Lola, Lola!
Let's not wake up Bailey.

03:04.575 --> 03:08.492
- Andre is a nonfactor.
- Well, I don't trust him.

03:08.492 --> 03:10.233
So, I'm doing my deep dive.

03:10.233 --> 03:13.193
I wanna know where he's lived,
his blood type,

03:13.193 --> 03:15.412
what rock he crawled out
from underneath. All of it.

03:15.412 --> 03:17.153
You didn't do a deep dive

03:17.153 --> 03:19.373
with your little mommy friend,
coupon scammer.

03:19.373 --> 03:22.811
There it is. Lola Carmichael
reaches in her back pocket

03:22.811 --> 03:25.640
and pulls out what she'd been
saving for a rainy day.

03:25.640 --> 03:28.904
The infamous coupon scam.
Well-played.

03:28.904 --> 03:30.297
High five.

03:32.081 --> 03:33.300
No?

03:36.172 --> 03:38.348
Maybe it's me you don't trust?

03:49.577 --> 03:51.796
Oh, hello.
Bona fide lawyer here.

03:51.796 --> 03:54.059
I should be arguing cases
and stacking courtroom wins,

03:54.059 --> 03:56.671
instead I'm still here
doing this grunt work.

03:56.671 --> 03:58.194
You've been a great help,

03:58.194 --> 03:59.717
especially since
Rachel is still in D.C.

03:59.717 --> 04:01.241
and I know it's a lot.

04:01.241 --> 04:02.807
The Big Pharma case
and supervising

04:02.807 --> 04:04.461
all these paralegals.

04:04.461 --> 04:06.507
Wait, they're not pushing
you around, are they?

04:06.507 --> 04:08.422
Yeah, they are especially
the snooty one right over there.

04:08.422 --> 04:10.032
- Andre's paralegal?
- Ben Fischer.

04:10.032 --> 04:12.034
the man turns his nose up
so much at me,

04:12.034 --> 04:14.123
I'm surprised
he doesn't have whiplash.

04:14.123 --> 04:17.605
Hey, I survived a stabbing,
I can certainly survive him.

04:17.605 --> 04:20.564
Don't worry, Amy,
it's just a 12-inch scar.

04:20.564 --> 04:23.393
I should be fine.
Now, the non-visible scar,

04:24.525 --> 04:25.787
I'm still working on that one.

04:25.787 --> 04:27.267
You know, we could all benefit

04:27.267 --> 04:28.964
from the counseling
that Lola set up.

04:28.964 --> 04:32.837
Yeah, well,
listening to my grandpop helps.

04:32.837 --> 04:36.014
I swear, the old man talks
to me like he's still here.

04:36.014 --> 04:39.453
I was nine when I first told him
that I wanted to be a lawyer.

04:39.453 --> 04:42.194
He used to say to me, "Nessa,
you're my little Themis.

04:42.194 --> 04:44.762
"You're my little lady
of justice.

04:44.762 --> 04:46.721
"You have the power
to overcome anything."

04:48.113 --> 04:49.811
I have two favorite superheroes,

04:49.811 --> 04:51.639
Themis and my grandpa.

04:54.729 --> 04:57.906
It would be great to hear
his voice right about now.

04:57.906 --> 04:59.777
I'm sorry,
I have to go deliver this.

05:04.521 --> 05:06.393
Good morning.

05:06.393 --> 05:08.656
Stalking me, Watkins? I thought
we changed the door code.

05:08.656 --> 05:10.484
- Don't you ever sleep?
- I do not.

05:10.484 --> 05:12.573
You should try counting
chimeras instead of sheep.

05:12.573 --> 05:14.226
- I hear it works wonders.
- Let it go, Callan.

05:14.226 --> 05:15.706
What's new
with the Brewer trial?

05:15.706 --> 05:17.665
You my friend,
need to let that go.

05:17.665 --> 05:19.623
You can watch it on the 11:00
news like everybody else.

05:19.623 --> 05:22.191
Gentlemen,
Choi's in the building.

05:22.191 --> 05:26.238
Hey! Thomas Choi,
we missed you around here, sir.

05:26.238 --> 05:27.718
Oh, I didn't miss you guys
one bit.

05:27.718 --> 05:29.807
- The lies you tell.
- Watkins.

05:29.807 --> 05:31.896
All right,
time to get down to business.

05:31.896 --> 05:33.681
Hey, Luke,
about the Carl Brewer case,

05:33.681 --> 05:35.857
do me a favor. Step to
the other side of that door.

05:35.857 --> 05:37.989
Damn, Choi,
you gonna do me like that?

05:37.989 --> 05:39.513
Oh, I'm going to do you
like that.

05:39.513 --> 05:40.949
I need to talk a little
trial strategy

05:40.949 --> 05:42.342
with my co-counsel here.

05:43.299 --> 05:45.388
- Love that guy.
- Ice cold, Choi.

05:45.388 --> 05:47.695
Hey, thank you for coming down
here all the way from Pomona.

05:47.695 --> 05:49.218
I appreciate
your expertise on this.

05:49.218 --> 05:50.567
Carl Brewer's left
a trail of murders

05:50.567 --> 05:52.439
in your jurisdiction and mine.

05:52.439 --> 05:54.397
Let's run down our biggies,
we've got our witnesses

05:54.397 --> 05:56.530
who've seen Brewer in locations
where he's buried bodies.

05:56.530 --> 05:58.662
- Check. Hair from the victims.
- Yep. We've got a murder weapon.

05:58.662 --> 06:00.751
Hell yeah. We also have the only
woman that Carl Brewer

06:00.751 --> 06:02.797
gives a damn about,
his sister, Mildred Brewer.

06:02.797 --> 06:04.494
Defense still plan on
calling her as a witness.

06:04.494 --> 06:06.235
Great, Callan,
are you sure you want to stick

06:06.235 --> 06:07.541
with what we discussed?

06:07.541 --> 06:09.194
Oh, abso-frickin-lutely.

06:09.194 --> 06:10.761
When we go to cross-examine
Ms. Brewer,

06:10.761 --> 06:12.763
that's when I toss
the grenade in.

06:12.763 --> 06:14.069
My finger's already on the pin.

06:30.259 --> 06:33.131
Okay, so that is definitely
not court business.

06:33.131 --> 06:35.090
Those googly eyes you're making.

06:35.090 --> 06:36.831
Sarah, who are you
flirt texting?

06:36.831 --> 06:39.355
- Spill the tea.
- Mmm. No, no!

06:39.355 --> 06:41.488
The tea just stay in my cup.

06:41.488 --> 06:43.185
- Yeah?
- Yeah. I'm sorry.

06:43.185 --> 06:45.056
Actually, I need a favor.

06:45.056 --> 06:47.885
Mmm, all right.
I'm all ears.

06:47.885 --> 06:49.496
- I need you to be my wingwoman.
- Come again.

06:49.496 --> 06:51.193
My wingwoman.

06:51.193 --> 06:53.891
I am finally
going to introduce my dad

06:53.891 --> 06:55.763
to Luke for the first time.

06:55.763 --> 06:58.896
The thing is, my dad
has always had this crazy tic

06:58.896 --> 07:01.943
when it's come to every
single guy I have ever dated.

07:01.943 --> 07:04.815
You're afraid he's going to go
all tick, tick, boom with Luke?

07:04.815 --> 07:08.906
Exactly. Yes. So your mission,
should you choose to accept it,

07:08.906 --> 07:11.953
is to stymie my dad's tic
with your wit.

07:11.953 --> 07:13.476
- What?
- Yeah.

07:13.476 --> 07:16.044
- No. Hell to the no.
- Why? Come on.

07:16.044 --> 07:17.959
You know you'll be--
you'll be a fun diversion

07:17.959 --> 07:21.266
to make things go right
should shit veer left.

07:21.266 --> 07:22.746
- Fine.
- Really?

07:22.746 --> 07:27.185
Yes. I will be your wing thingy, whatever.

07:27.185 --> 07:29.405
- You're the best.
- You will owe me big, Lopez.

07:29.405 --> 07:30.580
Deal.

07:33.017 --> 07:34.497
Good morning.

07:34.497 --> 07:36.804
- Your Honor, you look kinda--
- I'm not.

07:36.804 --> 07:38.196
Are you sure?
You look a little--

07:38.196 --> 07:39.807
- I'm fine.
- Well, if you want

07:39.807 --> 07:42.462
a little cheer me up,
we've got fan mail.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.072
It's been sitting in
the mail room for months

07:44.072 --> 07:46.030
and security has finally
done their sweep

07:46.030 --> 07:48.642
and now you are allowed to enjoy
it, and the rest of the judges

07:48.642 --> 07:51.688
to be jealous because you get
so much more fan mail than them.

07:51.688 --> 07:53.690
- More postcards?
- Mm hmm.

07:53.690 --> 07:56.737
"Judge Carmichael, would love
to see you here in Lawndale.

07:56.737 --> 07:59.130
"When are you coming
to Agoura Hills?"

07:59.130 --> 08:00.610
"Judge, hello.
We would love for you

08:00.610 --> 08:02.525
"to visit us here in Irvine."

08:02.525 --> 08:04.745
That's a pretty card.
"Love you, Judge Carmichael.

08:04.745 --> 08:07.530
"From your friends in
beautiful Temecula, greetings."

08:07.530 --> 08:08.923
Wow. Riverside County.

08:08.923 --> 08:11.055
- Hemet.
- Hemet?

08:11.055 --> 08:14.102
Now, I've been to all of these
places and they're wonderful.

08:14.102 --> 08:17.061
But you're not sure if they'd be
in your top ten travel hot list?

08:18.933 --> 08:22.110
Well, I do love my supporters.

08:22.110 --> 08:24.678
And they do love you.
Ooh, you could call them risers.

08:24.678 --> 08:27.289
Get it,
because all rise, risers.

08:27.289 --> 08:29.117
You should work
on something different.

08:29.117 --> 08:32.860
- I like it.
- Speaking of my number one fan,

08:32.860 --> 08:34.862
has she made it
into the courtroom?

08:34.862 --> 08:36.733
She's been here
for like an hour.

08:36.733 --> 08:39.910
Carl Brewer fires two
attorneys and then hires her.

08:39.910 --> 08:41.912
And why is she working
with him anyway?

08:41.912 --> 08:43.958
He doesn't seem like her type.

08:43.958 --> 08:46.003
It's like she stepped into the
private sector just for this.

08:46.003 --> 08:48.005
and you kicked her ass up
and down on Election Day,

08:48.005 --> 08:50.834
Well, I mean, she's been
pleasant so far, I guess.

08:50.834 --> 08:55.012
- And did you just say ass?
- Yes.

08:55.012 --> 08:57.101
I'm putting it on
my naughty word of the day.

08:57.101 --> 08:58.712
All rise.

08:58.712 --> 09:00.670
Judge Lola Carmichael presiding.

09:16.860 --> 09:20.516
Miss Cuthbert,
welcome to my courtroom.

09:20.516 --> 09:23.258
It's nice to see you again,
Judge Carmichael.

09:33.703 --> 09:35.400
Two of the women
were buried in landfills,

09:35.400 --> 09:37.272
one we found in a dumpster,

09:37.272 --> 09:40.275
and the most recent at
a construction site in Pomona.

09:40.275 --> 09:42.190
The murders
all followed a pattern.

09:42.190 --> 09:45.367
Gunshot wound to the head,
rope burns, hair ripped out.

09:45.367 --> 09:46.847
Detective,
did you recover a firearm

09:46.847 --> 09:48.544
during the course
of your investigation?

09:48.544 --> 09:50.720
We did. In my presence,
an officer found

09:50.720 --> 09:53.331
a 9mm at the scene
of a gang murder in Pomona.

09:53.331 --> 09:54.768
That was several months ago.

09:54.768 --> 09:55.986
Showing what was
previously marked

09:55.986 --> 09:57.248
as People's Exhibit three.

09:57.248 --> 09:59.033
Detective, do you believe

09:59.033 --> 10:00.904
that this firearm is
connected to this case?

10:00.904 --> 10:03.080
Yes. When we ran the serial
number of the firearm,

10:03.080 --> 10:05.169
it came back as registered
to Carl Brewer.

10:05.169 --> 10:07.563
We suspect he tried to sell it
through a gun buyback program.

10:07.563 --> 10:10.827
This asshole cop is lying,
you need to object.

10:10.827 --> 10:12.960
Brewer's gun ended up in
the hand of the gang member

10:12.960 --> 10:14.701
who was recently shot to death.

10:14.701 --> 10:16.703
Objection, speculation
and lack of foundation.

10:16.703 --> 10:18.530
Sustained. The last portion
of the answer is stricken.

10:18.530 --> 10:21.882
Detective on the monitor
is a piece of paper

10:21.882 --> 10:23.666
marked People's Exhibit 19.

10:23.666 --> 10:25.276
Do you recognize this?

10:25.276 --> 10:27.409
Yes. That's a receipt for ammo.

10:27.409 --> 10:29.019
We found it a couple
of months ago

10:29.019 --> 10:30.630
in the trunk
of Mr. Brewer's vehicle.

10:30.630 --> 10:32.501
The bullets
that Mr. Brewer purchased

10:32.501 --> 10:34.242
were for a 9mm.

10:34.242 --> 10:36.070
They are the same type
of bullet that killed

10:36.070 --> 10:37.593
all four of the victims
in this case.

10:37.593 --> 10:39.377
- Objection, foundation.
- Overruled.

10:39.377 --> 10:41.858
Subject to a foundation
being laid. Mr. Callan.

10:41.858 --> 10:43.468
Your Honor, I'll be calling
a ballistics expert.

10:43.468 --> 10:45.340
She'll be testifying
that she test-fired

10:45.340 --> 10:47.864
the weapon and determined
that it matched the projectiles

10:47.864 --> 10:49.997
found in the victim's,
as well as spent bullets

10:49.997 --> 10:52.216
found near each
of the crime scenes.

10:52.216 --> 10:54.349
- That's all, your Honor.
- Miss Cuthbert.

10:54.349 --> 10:56.264
Detective Collins,
you took the lead

10:56.264 --> 10:58.440
in all four of these
murder investigations,

10:58.440 --> 11:01.051
and you certainly are
a seasoned detective.

11:01.051 --> 11:03.140
But I think it's important
the jury know more about you.

11:03.140 --> 11:05.360
I apologize if this
gets uncomfortable.

11:05.360 --> 11:07.579
What I'm handing
the court is a document

11:07.579 --> 11:09.669
marked Defense Exhibit C.

11:09.669 --> 11:12.236
Opposing counsel
already has one.

11:12.236 --> 11:13.934
I would like to give one
to the detective.

11:13.934 --> 11:15.196
You may.

11:20.201 --> 11:23.595
Detective, what you're holding
is a disciplinary report

11:23.595 --> 11:25.728
from the Board of Police
Commissioners during

11:25.728 --> 11:28.688
the time you were investigating
the second murder, is it not?

11:29.863 --> 11:31.995
You were under
disciplinary proceedings

11:31.995 --> 11:34.432
with the LAPD Internal Affairs
Division, is that correct?

11:34.432 --> 11:37.653
- That was way back in 2009.
- You were being investigated

11:37.653 --> 11:40.090
for planting stolen jewelry,
is that correct?

11:40.090 --> 11:41.918
- Yes.
- And that's because you,

11:41.918 --> 11:44.791
in fact, tried to pin a burglary
on your wife's boyfriend

11:44.791 --> 11:47.228
by planting stolen jewelry
in his home. Is that right?

11:47.228 --> 11:48.795
The D.A. dropped
all the charges.

11:48.795 --> 11:50.274
I didn't ask you that, Detective.

11:50.274 --> 11:51.928
You attempted to set up the man

11:51.928 --> 11:53.843
with whom your wife
was having an affair.

11:53.843 --> 11:54.975
Is that true?

11:57.020 --> 11:58.587
That was the allegation.

11:58.587 --> 12:00.589
Detective, do you believe
that an officer

12:00.589 --> 12:03.984
who could frame his wife's
lover for residential burglary

12:03.984 --> 12:06.638
is an officer who could frame
Carl Brewer for murder?

12:06.638 --> 12:07.988
- Objection.
- Sustained.

12:07.988 --> 12:10.294
I think I've made my point.

12:10.294 --> 12:12.166
No further questions,
Your Honor.

12:21.871 --> 12:23.438
There.

12:27.485 --> 12:28.791
What the...

12:38.975 --> 12:40.890
What the hell just happened?

12:40.890 --> 12:43.588
I've been producing
legal docs for 30 years.

12:43.588 --> 12:46.156
I use a state-of-the-art
digital indexing system.

12:46.156 --> 12:48.463
Yes, so do I. But the error
occurred on your side, Ben.

12:48.463 --> 12:50.073
Oh my God,
I can't believe I did this.

12:50.073 --> 12:51.640
I'm gonna get fired.

12:51.640 --> 12:53.163
You beamed
our confidential documents

12:53.163 --> 12:54.904
to the opposing attorney.
We are the CIA,

12:54.904 --> 12:56.688
and you just gave the codes
to the Kremlin.

12:56.688 --> 12:58.299
Just let me think!

12:58.299 --> 12:59.735
Just bring
your blood pressure down.

12:59.735 --> 13:01.389
I'm sure Andre will understand,

13:01.389 --> 13:02.999
you've worked for him for,
like a 100 years.

13:02.999 --> 13:04.784
Without making a mistake,

13:04.784 --> 13:06.960
that's why I've worked
for him a 100 years.

13:06.960 --> 13:09.745
Okay.
Where's the fire?

13:10.615 --> 13:12.835
We might have a slight problem.

13:12.835 --> 13:14.576
So, you said Carl Brewer
would come into

13:14.576 --> 13:16.491
Jansen gas station
to fill up his tank.

13:16.491 --> 13:18.493
All the time. He's been coming
to that station for years,

13:18.493 --> 13:19.929
and he'd always come,
like, around 1:30

13:19.929 --> 13:21.539
in the morning during my shift.

13:21.539 --> 13:23.541
I took a graveyard shift
so I wouldn't have to be

13:23.541 --> 13:25.500
bothered much
to with customers, you know.

13:25.500 --> 13:27.719
Anywho, he was kind of weird,

13:27.719 --> 13:29.939
but it seemed he got weirder
these past few months.

13:29.939 --> 13:32.550
Always wanting
exactly $13.06 in gas.

13:32.550 --> 13:35.423
He'd give me $13 and a dime
and then stand there,

13:35.423 --> 13:38.295
waiting on four pennies back
in change.

13:38.295 --> 13:41.777
- I'm like, are you kidding me?
- Any other unusual behavior?

13:41.777 --> 13:43.866
He was flirty,
but in a serious way.

13:43.866 --> 13:46.826
Had this smirk and I though
he was tweaking on meth.

13:46.826 --> 13:49.176
Oh yeah. And he'd ask me what
kind of perfume I was wearing,

13:49.176 --> 13:51.439
if my hair was really mine.
Now, I ain't gonna to lie,

13:51.439 --> 13:53.484
he was kinda fine
for an old dude.

13:53.484 --> 13:55.138
But, he was way too extra.

13:55.138 --> 13:56.792
Thank you, Miss Dale.

13:58.838 --> 14:00.840
You told Mr. Choi
that you noticed a woman

14:00.840 --> 14:02.537
that you thought
was sleeping in the back

14:02.537 --> 14:04.147
of Mr. Brewer's car one night.
Is that right?

14:04.147 --> 14:05.670
Yep, I took a look
inside the car

14:05.670 --> 14:07.194
when Brewer was taking a piss.

14:07.194 --> 14:08.586
Looked like
the woman was wasted.

14:08.586 --> 14:10.240
And that was over
five years ago?

14:10.240 --> 14:11.894
And I still
remember that moment.

14:11.894 --> 14:13.853
You also said that
a couple of weeks later

14:13.853 --> 14:15.985
that you learned from the news
that the same woman was missing?

14:15.985 --> 14:18.031
Did you-- did you call
the police then?

14:18.031 --> 14:21.121
Yeah. No, I mean, I did call
recently, when they found--

14:21.121 --> 14:22.949
Recently?

14:22.949 --> 14:24.864
But you weren't alarmed enough
then to call the police?

14:24.864 --> 14:27.127
I didn't think anything
about that lady until I heard

14:27.127 --> 14:29.303
police suspected
she might have been murdered.

14:29.303 --> 14:31.044
That's all. Thank you.

14:31.044 --> 14:34.134
- Mr. Choi, any redirect?
- Thank you.

14:34.134 --> 14:37.267
Ms. Dale, the police
interviewed you many times.

14:37.267 --> 14:38.965
What did you eventually
learn from them

14:38.965 --> 14:40.531
about the woman you saw
in Brewer's vehicle?

14:40.531 --> 14:42.533
- Objection, calls for hearsay.
- Mr. Choi.

14:42.533 --> 14:44.100
Effect on the listener
Your Honor.

14:44.100 --> 14:45.667
Overruled.
The answer will be admitted

14:45.667 --> 14:47.016
for that non-hearsay purpose.

14:47.016 --> 14:49.540
You may answer the question.

14:49.540 --> 14:53.153
Detective Collins told me they
were investigating her murder.

14:53.153 --> 14:54.719
That's when I put
two and two together

14:54.719 --> 14:57.287
about Carl Brewer
and realized the woman

14:57.287 --> 14:59.550
I thought was passed out
was probably dead.

14:59.550 --> 15:01.335
And that's
what I told the police.

15:01.335 --> 15:03.772
I'm sure Brewer was wanting
me to be his next victim.

15:03.772 --> 15:05.905
Objection, speculation and 352.

15:05.905 --> 15:08.385
Sustained.
That last sentence is stricken.

15:14.522 --> 15:17.220
So again,
let me try and understand this?

15:17.220 --> 15:20.310
Our confidential,
privileged documents

15:20.310 --> 15:22.356
are now in the hands
of the opposing attorney.

15:22.356 --> 15:24.227
About 100 of them.

15:24.227 --> 15:26.229
I've checked the E-system
log about a gazillion times

15:26.229 --> 15:27.796
and I don't know
how it happened.

15:27.796 --> 15:30.146
It just did. I am--
I'm so sorry.

15:30.146 --> 15:33.323
Every scintilla
of communication between us

15:33.323 --> 15:36.500
and our Big Pharma client
is written in those documents.

15:36.500 --> 15:38.241
Yes, I understand.

15:38.241 --> 15:40.200
As I said, our legal strategies,
our weaknesses.

15:40.200 --> 15:43.377
We are fighting a major
civil class action lawsuit

15:43.377 --> 15:46.815
and that plaintiffs firm
represents dozens of litigants.

15:46.815 --> 15:49.644
Do you know
how much this sets us back?

15:49.644 --> 15:51.428
- Let's take a moment here.
- Who made the mistake?

15:52.386 --> 15:54.997
It was me. I made the mistake.

15:54.997 --> 15:56.912
But I put a digital key
on the document,

15:56.912 --> 15:58.435
so the plaintiff's lawyer's
shouldn't be able

15:58.435 --> 16:00.220
to access them.

16:00.220 --> 16:01.961
Yes, we've actually spoken
to the opposing attorney

16:01.961 --> 16:03.701
and he's threatening
to bring a motion to unlock

16:03.701 --> 16:05.747
the documents due
to negligent production.

16:05.747 --> 16:09.055
Moe Wardlow
is a very shady lawyer.

16:09.055 --> 16:12.232
If he so much as even
peeks at the page count,

16:12.232 --> 16:15.800
we are drowning in
multimillion dollar lawsuits.

16:15.800 --> 16:17.977
God damn it! Shit!

16:20.675 --> 16:25.636
You had two very
important duties, Vanessa.

16:25.636 --> 16:27.682
To oversee the paralegals

16:27.682 --> 16:33.296
and to maintain previous logs
of attorney client documents.

16:33.296 --> 16:35.603
I know I made a huge mistake,

16:35.603 --> 16:37.997
and I've only been a lawyer
for six minutes and two seconds.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.955
And this is not
how I imagined my beautiful

16:39.955 --> 16:42.479
new chapter to begin.
But I will figure this out.

16:43.306 --> 16:44.612
I will fix this.

16:48.703 --> 16:51.271
Hey, no Dad,
this is a state park.

16:51.271 --> 16:53.186
You can't smoke that here,
so please put it away.

16:53.186 --> 16:54.665
Thank you.

16:54.665 --> 16:56.972
I am so sorry I'm late.

16:56.972 --> 16:58.756
I was actually sitting
in on the trial.

16:58.756 --> 17:02.717
It's okay. Luke, this is
my father, Claudio Lopez.

17:02.717 --> 17:04.893
Dad, this is Luke Watkins.

17:04.893 --> 17:06.895
- It is an honor to meet you.
- Hello, young man.

17:06.895 --> 17:08.505
I've heard a lot
of great things about you.

17:08.505 --> 17:10.377
Only the great things are true.

17:14.424 --> 17:16.035
It's good to see you.

17:17.036 --> 17:18.863
- So, Mr. Lopez.
- Mmm...

17:18.863 --> 17:20.430
Emily is just
such a great friend,

17:20.430 --> 17:23.129
I just love her and I love Luke.

17:23.129 --> 17:27.959
She's great and he's great, and
together they're even greater.

17:32.225 --> 17:34.662
Dad, I know Mom had to work,
but it's so great to see you.

17:34.662 --> 17:37.143
Really good
to see you too, <i>mija.</i>

17:37.143 --> 17:39.797
You know,
I see your brother all the time.

17:39.797 --> 17:41.625
He's never too busy to come by.

17:41.625 --> 17:43.323
Yeah, I know that he's--
Well, you know--

17:43.323 --> 17:45.760
I have a secret agenda
for coming here today.

17:45.760 --> 17:47.544
You see <i>mijita,</i>
you're an attorney,

17:47.544 --> 17:50.025
and I need an attorney.

17:50.025 --> 17:53.072
- I'm a lawbreaker.
- Excuse me. What do you--

17:53.072 --> 17:55.683
I have to see a judge
about these-- these tickets

17:55.683 --> 18:02.385
that I sort of forgot about, and
I think I owe a few thousand,

18:02.385 --> 18:04.909
and I think they're going
to throw me in the clink.

18:09.131 --> 18:12.787
So, Lucius,
do you smoke cigars?

18:12.787 --> 18:14.615
Because to me,
you seem like a man

18:14.615 --> 18:16.878
who prefers the football hookah.

18:16.878 --> 18:19.272
It's actually, uh, Luke, sir.

18:32.459 --> 18:36.941
"Dear Judge, wish you were
here in gorgeous Lake Elsinore."

18:36.941 --> 18:38.900
Lake Elsinore?

18:38.900 --> 18:40.858
At least this postcard comes
from a well-known vacation spot.

18:40.858 --> 18:44.601
They just keep coming in.

18:44.601 --> 18:46.473
- What the hell?
- Everything okay?

18:46.473 --> 18:49.128
Just got an alert that
Carl Brewer did an interview.

18:49.128 --> 18:51.086
<i>So wonderful to be with you.</i>

18:51.086 --> 18:53.132
<i>Thank you for allowing
my client to tell his story.</i>

18:53.132 --> 18:55.699
<i>Carl, you wanted to say?
Yes.</i>

18:55.699 --> 18:57.745
<i>You know, first of all,
I just want to say I'm--</i>

18:57.745 --> 18:59.355
<i>I'm so blessed to be here.</i>

18:59.355 --> 19:01.183
I cannot believe her.

19:01.183 --> 19:03.664
I want to speak to her
before we bring in the jury.

19:03.664 --> 19:07.755
Look, I don't want my sister
up there on that witness stand.

19:07.755 --> 19:09.539
I understand it's a huge risk.

19:09.539 --> 19:11.454
It's the best shot we've got.

19:11.454 --> 19:13.369
The jury should know
about your personal struggles.

19:13.369 --> 19:15.763
And your sister
wants to testify.

19:17.417 --> 19:19.636
Judge Carmichael must have
gotten a news alert.

19:19.636 --> 19:21.551
- Why do you say that?
- She wants to see me.

19:29.994 --> 19:31.779
Hey.

19:31.779 --> 19:33.520
Got I.T. to do a scrub down.

19:33.520 --> 19:35.304
Hopefully, there's a glitch
in there somewhere.

19:35.304 --> 19:37.132
I still don't understand
how the opposing lawyer

19:37.132 --> 19:39.178
- got a hold of our files.
- Ben just talked to Andre

19:39.178 --> 19:41.310
and took full responsibility
for the error.

19:41.310 --> 19:43.138
So, you were covering for him?

19:43.138 --> 19:45.140
I found out that
he's got a sick wife at home.

19:45.140 --> 19:48.099
Cancer explains why he's been so
off putting and scatterbrained.

19:48.099 --> 19:50.014
Andre fired him.

19:50.014 --> 19:52.669
Of course you work for
Audubon and Quinn, not Andre.

19:52.669 --> 19:55.542
And no one is firing you.

19:55.542 --> 19:59.067
Ness, we're not going to let
this setback defeat us.

19:59.067 --> 20:01.504
What would Themis and grandpop
say to you in this moment?

20:01.504 --> 20:03.245
Oh, I know you didn't just bring

20:03.245 --> 20:04.855
my two favorite
superheroes into this.

20:08.555 --> 20:10.252
I thought we had
an understanding

20:10.252 --> 20:12.602
about not litigating
this case in the media?

20:12.602 --> 20:14.952
Ms. Cuthbert, what you pulled
was a slick move

20:14.952 --> 20:16.780
to try to drum up
public support.

20:16.780 --> 20:18.565
Sometimes a gag order
is unconstitutional

20:18.565 --> 20:20.044
due to a prior restraint
on free speech.

20:20.044 --> 20:21.829
And I don't have to follow it.

20:21.829 --> 20:24.440
I didn't make a gag order.
I merely asked both sides

20:24.440 --> 20:25.920
if they were considering
talking to the media.

20:25.920 --> 20:27.791
You said you would not,

20:27.791 --> 20:30.229
and yet you do an interview
that drops on day one.

20:30.229 --> 20:31.795
I just told the facts
in that interview.

20:31.795 --> 20:33.623
My client did suffer
from leukemia.

20:33.623 --> 20:35.538
His Miranda rights
were violated one time

20:35.538 --> 20:37.061
and he was acquitted of murder.

20:37.061 --> 20:38.715
I want to ensure
this trial proceeds

20:38.715 --> 20:41.283
with proper decorum
and not like a circus.

20:41.283 --> 20:43.067
And for months,
your client has sought

20:43.067 --> 20:45.069
media attention, book offers.

20:45.069 --> 20:46.549
How many book offers
have you entertained since

20:46.549 --> 20:47.681
you've been reelected,
Your Honor?

20:49.335 --> 20:50.640
I hear it's quite a number.

20:53.339 --> 20:55.515
Move to strike, go off record.

20:55.515 --> 20:58.169
Something you want to
get off your chest, Corrine?

20:58.169 --> 21:00.433
I just can't help but wonder
how you and your sketchy cohorts

21:00.433 --> 21:02.478
at the D.A.'s office managed
to subvert the election.

21:02.478 --> 21:05.394
I'm here
because voters put me here.

21:05.394 --> 21:08.049
That's because they didn't
know about the corruption.

21:08.049 --> 21:10.181
Tell me, did you manage
to get the taxpayers back

21:10.181 --> 21:13.010
the $500,000 that evaporated
from your campaign?

21:13.010 --> 21:15.317
If a document can be leaked
from the Supreme Court,

21:15.317 --> 21:17.537
it most certainly can be leaked
from the public integrity unit.

21:17.537 --> 21:19.539
There was nefarious
activity within my campaign.

21:19.539 --> 21:22.629
Once we found out, we tied
it up and took out the trash.

21:22.629 --> 21:25.632
Now I did not owe you
that explanation, Corrine,

21:25.632 --> 21:27.460
but damn,
I'm glad I gave it to you.

21:27.460 --> 21:28.852
Now, you may step back.

21:28.852 --> 21:29.984
Back on the record.

21:31.420 --> 21:34.989
Ms. Cuthbert, if I discover
that any one of my jurors

21:34.989 --> 21:37.208
caught wind of
your little publicity stunt,

21:37.208 --> 21:39.036
I will give serious consideration

21:39.036 --> 21:40.951
to holding you in contempt.

21:47.567 --> 21:49.699
Five red light
camera violations,

21:49.699 --> 21:52.702
all unpaid plus
the speeding tickets.

21:53.790 --> 21:55.444
What are we gonna do
about this, sir?

21:55.444 --> 21:57.925
Five, Dad?
You didn't tell me about--

21:57.925 --> 21:59.361
Okay.

22:00.928 --> 22:03.147
Your Honor,
my name is Emily Lopez.

22:03.147 --> 22:05.933
I am Claudio Lopez's daughter,
and I am his attorney.

22:05.933 --> 22:07.064
And on behalf of my client.

22:07.064 --> 22:08.892
- Ms. Lopez?
- Yes?

22:08.892 --> 22:10.764
It's not the trial of
the century. Would you mind?

22:14.376 --> 22:16.465
Mr. Lopez, talk to me.

22:16.944 --> 22:18.380
Stand, Dad.

22:20.513 --> 22:23.864
Judge. I never put
anyone's life in danger.

22:23.864 --> 22:26.432
I always look both ways
before I run the light.

22:26.432 --> 22:27.563
No.

22:29.173 --> 22:31.785
It's amazing you were never
picked up on the bench warrant.

22:31.785 --> 22:34.831
Ready to go to jail today,
because I can put you there.

22:34.831 --> 22:36.877
You don't have to go through
all that hassle, Your Honor.

22:36.877 --> 22:38.661
Then, tell me
why you are a speed demon

22:38.661 --> 22:40.663
who likes to run red lights?

22:40.663 --> 22:43.362
Well, the truth is,
there are way too many

22:43.362 --> 22:45.581
of those damn red light
cameras in my neighborhood.

22:45.581 --> 22:47.235
And the lights are super long.

22:47.235 --> 22:49.150
Up to three,
sometimes four minutes.

22:49.150 --> 22:51.935
I'm an old man.
I've survived two heart attacks,

22:51.935 --> 22:54.155
the failure
of my trucking business.

22:54.155 --> 22:55.852
I picked myself back up,

22:55.852 --> 22:58.028
I got my company running again.

22:58.028 --> 23:02.946
And I'm just trying to enjoy
every millisecond of life

23:02.946 --> 23:04.557
before the credits roll.

23:10.301 --> 23:13.348
I just don't have time
to wait for a long red light.

23:29.495 --> 23:33.716
This bubbly behavior's
unusual even for you. What's up?

23:33.716 --> 23:36.240
You've got 40 minutes
before your trial starts.

23:36.240 --> 23:38.329
- There's plenty of time.
- For?

23:39.461 --> 23:41.071
You may enter.

23:44.945 --> 23:47.861
Sherri, who's on
the other side of that door?

23:48.557 --> 23:50.994
Just-- Okay--

23:55.521 --> 23:57.784
We've really got
to work on your timings.

23:57.784 --> 24:00.003
My timing was a little off,
I know.

24:29.642 --> 24:32.819
These past couple months
have been really hard

24:34.168 --> 24:36.562
and it's felt like
we were strangers.

24:38.477 --> 24:41.567
I don't want us to be.
I just needed some time alone.

24:43.830 --> 24:46.093
I can tell you
that there will be no more

24:46.093 --> 24:49.270
personal background checks,
into Mr. Armstrong.

24:49.923 --> 24:51.054
I promise.

24:51.054 --> 24:52.360
Baby, I never meant

24:52.360 --> 24:53.970
for any of this to happen.

24:53.970 --> 24:57.104
- But it did.
- It was a stupid kiss.

24:58.192 --> 25:00.499
Will you please forgive me?

25:01.630 --> 25:02.849
I already have.

25:06.287 --> 25:08.463
But...

25:08.463 --> 25:11.945
if there are any more
stupid kisses...

25:13.468 --> 25:14.643
we're done.

25:16.079 --> 25:18.821
I'm not trying to be an asshole,
baby. Just being honest.

25:18.821 --> 25:24.697
The only stupid kisses
I want are from my husband.

25:24.697 --> 25:29.136
That's sweet,
a little corny but sweet.

25:29.136 --> 25:31.921
Corny? Look who's talking.

25:42.584 --> 25:44.455
The hearing will probably
go an hour.

25:44.455 --> 25:46.893
Then we can get back
to that fire we need to put out.

25:46.893 --> 25:49.025
Like I said, Nessa's doing
her best to turn things around.

25:49.025 --> 25:51.332
- There is no need to browbeat--
- She still hasn't found a fix

25:51.332 --> 25:53.116
for the mistake that
happened on her watch.

25:53.116 --> 25:55.379
Oh, the mistake your
paralegal may have made.

25:55.379 --> 25:57.164
Termination is not
a dirty word, Amy.

25:57.164 --> 25:58.905
You need to hold
Vanessa accountable.

25:58.905 --> 26:00.907
Rachel and I will handle
this the best we see fit.

26:00.907 --> 26:02.909
Excuse me.

26:03.518 --> 26:04.954
Hello.

26:09.132 --> 26:13.354
Andre Armstrong,
Robin Taylor, Lola's husband.

26:13.354 --> 26:15.008
Figured it's about time
you and I met.

26:15.008 --> 26:18.141
Oh, yes nice to meet you.
She speaks so highly--

26:18.141 --> 26:19.969
I'm gonna need you
to stay away from my wife.

26:19.969 --> 26:21.710
- Hold up now.
- No, you hold up.

26:21.710 --> 26:23.451
The next time you think
about planting a kiss

26:23.451 --> 26:25.453
on my wife, think twice.
It's going to be a problem

26:25.453 --> 26:27.107
if I see some shit
like that again.

26:27.107 --> 26:28.674
- Oh, you saw that?
- Yeah.

26:28.674 --> 26:32.329
Oh wow.
Look, I'm really sorry, I am.

26:32.329 --> 26:33.853
I'll be more careful next time.

26:33.853 --> 26:35.289
There's not gonna be
a next time.

26:35.289 --> 26:37.073
There's no need for hostility.

26:37.073 --> 26:39.119
We can sit down like two
mature adults, talk this out,

26:39.119 --> 26:41.338
crack open a bottle of the
hard stuff with the blue label.

26:41.338 --> 26:42.775
My treat.

26:44.298 --> 26:46.822
Just know I don't like no
grown ass man walking up on me.

26:46.822 --> 26:48.345
I said all I needed to say.

26:50.130 --> 26:51.958
Heard you're an FBI agent.

26:51.958 --> 26:54.003
Anything in the building
we need to be concerned about.

26:54.003 --> 26:55.788
Must be a reason you're here?

26:55.788 --> 26:58.834
There's a reason,
I'm visiting my beautiful wife.

26:58.834 --> 27:00.880
I'm friends with all
the security in the H.O.J.

27:00.880 --> 27:03.970
I know all the ins and outs,
I pop up over here all the time.

27:03.970 --> 27:05.885
Is that right?

27:05.885 --> 27:08.322
Well, since you're familiar
with the H.O.J. layout,

27:08.322 --> 27:10.019
I'm sure you know

27:10.019 --> 27:11.891
there's a dual entrance
to Lola's chambers.

27:11.891 --> 27:14.110
The front and the back.

27:14.110 --> 27:16.635
Ah damn, I prefer the back.

27:17.461 --> 27:18.724
Okay...

27:20.160 --> 27:23.250
Robin, hi, nice to see you.
How's Lola? How's Bailey?

27:23.250 --> 27:26.601
Bailey's great.
It's great to see you, too Amy.

27:26.601 --> 27:28.777
Tell Mark I say hey.

27:41.485 --> 27:44.053
The leukemia nearly killed him.

27:44.053 --> 27:47.187
He was bedridden
for most of his young life.

27:48.101 --> 27:50.669
My brother is not evil.

27:50.669 --> 27:54.455
He is a warm and gentle soul.

27:55.499 --> 27:57.545
After our mother left us...

28:01.157 --> 28:05.118
I've always been there to
protect Carl since we were kids.

28:05.118 --> 28:07.598
Miss Brewer, I used to represent
the police union,

28:07.598 --> 28:10.079
so I understand that most
officers go above and beyond

28:10.079 --> 28:12.212
their commitment
to serve and protect.

28:12.212 --> 28:13.779
But I do want to ask you

28:13.779 --> 28:15.258
what your experience
was with the police?

28:15.258 --> 28:17.913
Oh, for years
they harassed Carl.

28:17.913 --> 28:22.613
Tried to accuse him of these
brutal crimes these murders.

28:22.613 --> 28:25.181
It got so bad,
we moved a couple of times.

28:25.181 --> 28:27.183
Mr. Brewer.

28:27.183 --> 28:29.490
Bailiff, he needs
medical attention.

28:29.490 --> 28:31.448
- I'm calling a medic.
- Carl.

28:31.448 --> 28:33.102
- Help him!
- Get the jury out.

28:37.106 --> 28:38.804
Carl!

28:46.159 --> 28:49.118
Y'ello! Y'all need a cowbell
on that front door.

28:49.118 --> 28:52.208
- Moe Wardlow, it's been a while.
- Sure has, Armstrong.

28:52.208 --> 28:54.036
Heck, I still tell
stories about you and I

28:54.036 --> 28:55.995
doing battle during
the tobacco litigation wars.

28:55.995 --> 28:58.475
Never repped big tobacco.
You've got me confused.

29:00.913 --> 29:04.090
- Amy Quinn, meet Moe Wardlow.
- Okay, okay.

29:04.090 --> 29:05.918
Help yourself to water, coffee,

29:05.918 --> 29:07.833
or if you prefer something
a little more robust,

29:07.833 --> 29:09.704
- we've got that too.
- I'll stick with water

29:09.704 --> 29:12.533
'til you all give me
that check we know is coming.

29:12.533 --> 29:14.578
Nah, who needs water?
I ain't a boat.

29:17.233 --> 29:20.541
Okay, we do not need
to settle with this guy, okay.

29:20.541 --> 29:21.977
We can get our documents back.

29:21.977 --> 29:23.762
As I said,
Wardlow is the mosquito

29:23.762 --> 29:25.720
that can suck the lifeblood out
of all of us.

29:25.720 --> 29:27.678
That's worth the hefty price
to make this right.

29:31.378 --> 29:33.684
Yeah. Thank you.

29:33.684 --> 29:35.817
Just confirmed another
cold case murder.

29:35.817 --> 29:38.167
Woman's remains found in Pomona.

29:38.167 --> 29:40.343
Autopsy revealed a similar
killing pattern to--

29:40.343 --> 29:42.128
How close to Jensen gas station?

29:42.128 --> 29:45.044
Less than a mile. They found her
at the construction site

29:45.044 --> 29:47.133
- off Dorsey Road.
- Been dead for a while.

29:47.133 --> 29:49.788
Same area the police found the
victim Rydell testified about.

29:49.788 --> 29:52.225
It will be a shame
if Brewer croaks.

29:52.225 --> 29:53.792
Kills a bunch of people,

29:53.792 --> 29:55.445
then goes out
like some kind of martyr.

29:58.405 --> 30:00.624
Looks like Brewer's
number is not up yet.

30:00.624 --> 30:03.192
Don't think I've ever prayed
for serial killer's

30:03.192 --> 30:04.585
speedy recovery before.

30:04.585 --> 30:06.587
- Asked and answered.
- Amen!

30:08.719 --> 30:11.897
It's illegal, Mr. Lopez.

30:14.508 --> 30:16.815
You're a lucky man.

30:16.815 --> 30:21.080
500 bucks is a far cry
from the few thousand dollars

30:21.080 --> 30:22.646
you owe for those
speeding tickets.

30:22.646 --> 30:25.258
- And a far cry from jail.
- Mm hmm. Yeah.

30:25.258 --> 30:27.260
Mr. Lopez, your daughter
means a lot to me.

30:28.739 --> 30:30.611
She helped me through
some really rough times.

30:30.611 --> 30:32.439
Emily told me you took
a bullet or something.

30:32.439 --> 30:34.441
Yeah, she was with me
the whole time.

30:34.441 --> 30:35.834
She helped me recover.

30:35.834 --> 30:38.271
I need her in my life.

30:39.663 --> 30:41.578
I'm hoping that you
and I can get to know

30:41.578 --> 30:42.928
each other a little better.

30:45.234 --> 30:49.021
I'll tell you what,
the next time we talk,

30:49.717 --> 30:52.807
bring some old cognac.

30:52.807 --> 30:56.332
It goes down nice
with a good cigar.

30:56.332 --> 30:58.639
It looks like Luke and your
dad are going to be just fine.

30:58.639 --> 31:00.684
Uh-uh. Nope!

31:00.684 --> 31:03.949
My dad, he is playing it cool.
Okay, I know him.

31:03.949 --> 31:06.255
Luke is going to have
a challenge on his hands.

31:06.255 --> 31:08.127
- Trust me.
- I still say you did not need me

31:08.127 --> 31:09.824
to be your wingwoman.

31:09.824 --> 31:11.434
Yeah, I know.
I just like having you around.

31:11.434 --> 31:13.915
- Mm.
- Okay.

31:13.915 --> 31:17.223
Tell me right now who you have
been texting like a mad woman.

31:17.223 --> 31:18.877
Fess up. Who is it?

31:20.748 --> 31:22.358
Wardlow, what you received
are privileged

31:22.358 --> 31:24.273
and confidential attorney
client documents.

31:24.273 --> 31:26.145
Oh, I know.

31:26.145 --> 31:28.147
Forstaff v. Casper.

31:28.147 --> 31:30.062
Southern District of New York
held that gross negligence

31:30.062 --> 31:33.282
by competent counsel can waive
attorney client privilege.

31:33.282 --> 31:35.371
Now, I'm assuming that
you guys are competent.

31:35.371 --> 31:37.852
No federal court's gonna give
you access to our documents.

31:37.852 --> 31:39.419
Beyond that,
you don't have a case.

31:39.419 --> 31:41.987
Our client's drug works.
It helps people.

31:41.987 --> 31:44.293
And we know you can't back up
your nonsense claims of damages.

31:44.293 --> 31:46.121
Oh, I can and I will.

31:46.121 --> 31:48.558
But before we even get to trial,
you Big Pharma clients

31:48.558 --> 31:50.473
are going to sue you up
the wazoo for malpractice,

31:50.473 --> 31:52.127
giving away
their privileged communication,

31:52.127 --> 31:54.390
exposing their national
liability. But remember,

31:54.390 --> 31:57.219
I gave you the opportunity
to close Pandora's box.

31:57.219 --> 31:59.918
Five million. Full settlement,
and you immediately drop

31:59.918 --> 32:02.224
your motion for us to deliver
the digital caseload.

32:02.224 --> 32:03.922
Too slow, too low. 30 million.

32:03.922 --> 32:05.271
Andre, we're not doing this.

32:05.271 --> 32:06.837
- 7 million.
- 25 million.

32:06.837 --> 32:08.187
But that is my final.

32:09.753 --> 32:12.931
Time's a ticking folks. You're
the hare, not the tortoise.

32:14.802 --> 32:17.761
Me and my brother moved
to Pomona about 20 years ago,

32:17.761 --> 32:19.850
I guess.
Lived there a few years.

32:19.850 --> 32:21.722
Was Carl bedridden
the entire time?

32:21.722 --> 32:23.332
- He was sick?
- Was he bedridden?

32:23.332 --> 32:24.855
I don't know what you're asking.

32:24.855 --> 32:26.683
Ask it a different way.
Mr. Callan.

32:26.683 --> 32:28.685
Yes, Your Honor. Were there
times where your brother

32:28.685 --> 32:30.861
was well enough that he could
leave the house on his own?

32:30.861 --> 32:33.212
- I suppose so. But not often.
- No. You said at one point,

32:33.212 --> 32:35.518
Ms. Brewer, that you had to get
rid of most of your furniture?

32:35.518 --> 32:38.043
To make room for his gurney
and his medical supplies.

32:38.043 --> 32:39.740
It was a lot.

32:39.740 --> 32:41.611
What did you do with
all of that furniture?

32:41.611 --> 32:43.657
- You sell it, you store it?
- I put it in self-storage.

32:43.657 --> 32:45.659
- You still have that unit?
- I haven't been there in years.

32:45.659 --> 32:48.009
But you still have it?
This is the unit that's leased

32:48.009 --> 32:50.403
under your married name, Price.

32:50.403 --> 32:52.318
- Yes!
- I understand that you've lost

32:52.318 --> 32:54.146
your husband a number
of years back.

32:54.146 --> 32:56.365
Does anyone else have
access to this storage unit?

32:57.236 --> 32:59.455
No, just me.

32:59.455 --> 33:01.240
Ms. Brewer, of course,
you understand that your brother

33:01.240 --> 33:03.633
is charged with the murders
of these four women

33:03.633 --> 33:06.245
and that each of them
was found with a patch

33:06.245 --> 33:08.029
of hair missing from
the back of their heads.

33:10.423 --> 33:12.207
Prosecution would
like to present

33:12.207 --> 33:16.820
People's Exhibits
23, 24, 25 and 26.

33:16.820 --> 33:18.997
Each of these bags
contains hair ripped

33:18.997 --> 33:20.868
from the scalps
of these four women.

33:20.868 --> 33:23.001
These four bags,
along with eight others

33:23.001 --> 33:26.917
just like them, were found in
your storage unit Ms. Brewer.

33:28.615 --> 33:31.270
You and your brother
kept hair as souvenirs

33:31.270 --> 33:33.359
from the women you killed
and you covered for him.

33:33.359 --> 33:35.187
Objection! Assumes facts
not in evidence.

33:35.187 --> 33:37.102
There's no evidence
that this witness knew that

33:37.102 --> 33:39.191
these items were in storage.
In fact, maybe they weren't?

33:39.191 --> 33:41.715
Detective Collins had a search
warrant and several others

33:41.715 --> 33:44.370
of his colleagues were present
when this evidence was seized.

33:44.370 --> 33:45.849
Leave my sister alone!

33:45.849 --> 33:48.200
You leave my damn sister alone!

33:48.200 --> 33:49.853
- Bailiff!
- Judge Carmichael please,

33:49.853 --> 33:51.812
please don't throw
my sister in jail.

33:51.812 --> 33:53.422
She ain't have nothing
to do with this.

33:53.422 --> 33:56.469
Mildred, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Mildred!

34:03.476 --> 34:06.087
- We should take the deal.
- You can't be serious?

34:06.087 --> 34:07.610
- Listen to me.
- No, no.

34:07.610 --> 34:09.264
I'm not cutting
a deal with Brewer.

34:09.264 --> 34:11.092
We are going after the
death penalty. That's it.

34:11.092 --> 34:13.051
Let's at least hear him out.
Maybe Brewer can help us.

34:13.051 --> 34:14.922
Time's ticking.

34:14.922 --> 34:17.055
Judge Carmichael
gave us 15 minutes.

34:19.100 --> 34:21.450
We'll go along with
25 to life on each murder.

34:21.450 --> 34:23.670
The death penalty
and life without parole

34:23.670 --> 34:25.411
will both be taken off
the table.

34:25.411 --> 34:26.847
If your client gives us
what we want

34:26.847 --> 34:28.762
and I am not budging on that.

34:28.762 --> 34:30.633
I'm only standing here
because my client wanted me to.

34:30.633 --> 34:32.331
I insist we go back to trial.

34:32.331 --> 34:34.985
- No, no.
- Mr. Brewer?

34:34.985 --> 34:37.205
I said no.

34:39.164 --> 34:40.339
I'm tired of it.

34:43.559 --> 34:44.691
I'm tired.

34:50.653 --> 34:53.265
I think 15 million is a bargain,
Armstrong. Come with it.

34:53.265 --> 34:57.660
No, I think you owe us
the inadvertent disclosure.

34:57.660 --> 35:00.402
It wasn't negligence by us.
It was deception against us.

35:00.402 --> 35:01.969
What the hell
are you talking about?

35:01.969 --> 35:03.710
Shut up, Wardlow.
Go on, Ness.

35:03.710 --> 35:05.451
The privileged documents
were accidently sent

35:05.451 --> 35:07.366
to Mr. Wardlow
because of a tech error

35:07.366 --> 35:09.107
that occurred due
to differences

35:09.107 --> 35:10.804
in software systems
between us and them.

35:10.804 --> 35:13.241
Us meaning us
and them meaning him.

35:13.241 --> 35:15.113
I finally found the gremlin.

35:15.113 --> 35:17.202
Our software systems
are top notch.

35:17.202 --> 35:18.725
- Your system is booty.
- So what?

35:18.725 --> 35:20.292
Glen Fischer did nothing wrong.

35:20.292 --> 35:21.945
He properly downloaded
and transferred

35:21.945 --> 35:23.643
the electronic documents.

35:23.643 --> 35:25.601
It was Wardlow's secret server

35:25.601 --> 35:27.734
that caused the malfunction.
And yes, I say secret server.

35:27.734 --> 35:30.693
I broke the code
to this man's private cloud.

35:30.693 --> 35:33.087
He's been hiding plenty of
privileged documents in there.

35:33.087 --> 35:34.828
These are actually just a few.

35:34.828 --> 35:36.917
Mr. Wardlow,
you have been holding back

35:36.917 --> 35:38.614
from producing in
violation of federal law.

35:38.614 --> 35:40.486
Now, I have reviewed
these docs up and through,

35:40.486 --> 35:42.618
and they prove that
your lawsuit is meritless

35:42.618 --> 35:45.143
and your claims of damages
are utter foolishness.

35:45.143 --> 35:47.841
We've taken steps
to prevent disclosure.

35:47.841 --> 35:50.017
- We are protected.
- And who, pray tell are you?

35:50.017 --> 35:52.106
Vanessa "Ness" Johnson, Esquire.

35:54.282 --> 35:57.372
Wardlow,
get the hell out of here.

35:57.372 --> 35:59.026
I'll send you a bill
for reimbursement

35:59.026 --> 36:01.159
for our litigation expenses.

36:03.813 --> 36:06.294
25 to life on each count.

36:06.294 --> 36:08.383
Is that both parties
understanding of the agreement?

36:08.383 --> 36:09.993
- Yes, Your Honor.
- Yes, Your Honor.

36:09.993 --> 36:12.431
Mr. Brewer, I understand
you have disclosed

36:12.431 --> 36:15.173
to law enforcement
where you have buried 12 women

36:15.173 --> 36:17.305
that you've murdered.
Is that correct?

36:17.305 --> 36:19.960
Yes, Judge Carmichael.

36:19.960 --> 36:21.527
You have a document
in front of you

36:21.527 --> 36:23.398
that lists those locations, correct?

36:23.398 --> 36:26.532
Yes. Judge Carmichael.

36:26.532 --> 36:29.143
Before I approve this agreement,
I would like for you

36:29.143 --> 36:32.799
to read those places aloud
to this court as a matter

36:32.799 --> 36:35.976
of public record
and as a matter of justice.

36:35.976 --> 36:39.197
Yes, Judge Carmichael.

36:43.853 --> 36:46.595
Just like old times, boss.
Thank you.

36:46.595 --> 36:48.467
My bravo assigned you
with finding my replacement.

36:48.467 --> 36:50.077
What's the hold up, Callan?

36:50.077 --> 36:52.122
It's no small task,
filling your shoes, sir.

36:52.122 --> 36:54.255
Well, heads up,
something's coming down

36:54.255 --> 36:55.865
the pike that's going
to rock the D.A.'s office.

36:55.865 --> 36:57.476
Get any more
info on that heads up?

36:57.476 --> 36:58.999
Good, bad?

36:58.999 --> 37:01.175
Just buy yourself
a warm coat, Callan,

37:01.175 --> 37:03.046
it's going to be
a cold winter in L.A.

37:04.309 --> 37:05.571
See you soon.

37:11.707 --> 37:15.320
So, if I had been spending
more quality time with my dad,

37:15.320 --> 37:16.886
I probably would have known

37:16.886 --> 37:18.888
about the tickets stacking up,
you know?

37:18.888 --> 37:21.848
But I'm-- I'm gonna be better
at the whole family thing.

37:21.848 --> 37:25.591
I will even visit my idiot
brother more often once I--

37:25.591 --> 37:27.201
Move out of
your idiot brother's house.

37:27.201 --> 37:28.463
Exactly.

37:30.073 --> 37:31.423
- Hey, Em.
- Yeah.

37:31.423 --> 37:33.033
Could you can give me a moment?

37:35.122 --> 37:36.384
Yeah, yeah.

37:40.475 --> 37:44.218
Mr. Watkins, I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to interrupt.

37:44.218 --> 37:45.959
It's okay.

37:45.959 --> 37:48.918
Thank you for representing
Carl the first time.

37:48.918 --> 37:50.746
My brother doesn't know this,

37:50.746 --> 37:54.228
but I found a picture
he had of a woman.

37:54.228 --> 37:58.406
She had a tattoo of a Bible
verse from first Corinthians.

37:58.406 --> 38:01.801
"Love does not delight in evil,
but rejoices with the truth."

38:01.801 --> 38:03.411
Chapter 13, verse 6.

38:03.411 --> 38:06.196
6.

38:06.196 --> 38:11.201
The verse on the woman
he swears he didn't kill.

38:11.201 --> 38:16.206
A serial killer
is not who I have loved

38:16.206 --> 38:18.644
and taken care
of all these years.

38:18.644 --> 38:22.735
That's not my brother.
That can't be him.

38:22.735 --> 38:24.606
I'm so sorry.

38:47.934 --> 38:50.632
Congratulations
on the Brewer case.

38:50.632 --> 38:55.245
Thanks. It feels like
a bit of a hollow victory.

38:55.245 --> 38:59.554
There's just so many victims,
more than we even realized.

38:59.554 --> 39:02.644
Lola was all shaken up
at the end.

39:02.644 --> 39:06.866
Do me a favor and circle
Saturday, October 15th,

39:06.866 --> 39:08.476
- on your calendar.
- Okay.

39:08.476 --> 39:10.043
Because that is the day

39:10.043 --> 39:12.959
that I would like
to become Mrs. Callan.

39:13.394 --> 39:14.613

you weren't paying attention.

39:59.919 --> 40:02.791
Just read the document
in front of you, Mr. Brewer.

40:02.791 --> 40:06.708
Irvine, 2011, buried a body
in open field off of the 133.

40:08.580 --> 40:10.233
