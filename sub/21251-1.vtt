00:32.066 --> 00:33.734
Holy crap, Anita!

00:33.767 --> 00:35.136
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

00:35.169 --> 00:36.537
I was trying to be quiet.

00:36.570 --> 00:37.705
I didn't want to wake them.

00:37.738 --> 00:39.073
It's okay.

00:39.107 --> 00:40.341
I appreciate you staying late.

00:40.374 --> 00:41.509
Yeah, of course.

00:41.542 --> 00:42.343
Well, see you tomorrow!

00:42.376 --> 00:42.810
Good night.

02:07.861 --> 02:10.198
We could have been
something special.

02:11.599 --> 02:13.434
We could have been
something beautiful.

02:16.770 --> 02:18.272
We could have been a family.

02:19.907 --> 02:22.376
We could have been a family.

02:56.810 --> 02:58.846
Mrs. Brown?

02:58.879 --> 03:01.315
Mrs. Brown?

03:01.349 --> 03:03.717
I forgot my phone...

03:07.755 --> 03:09.257
Mrs. Brown?

04:05.379 --> 04:07.281
I was up first!
I get to choose!

04:07.315 --> 04:09.517
Nu-uh, I have to watch
Nova for my report!

04:11.919 --> 04:14.688
Oh no. They're up!

04:14.722 --> 04:15.689
They're awake!
They're awake!

04:15.723 --> 04:16.390
Who'se awake?

04:16.423 --> 04:17.325
The boys!

04:17.358 --> 04:18.392
Quick, quick, quick.

04:18.426 --> 04:19.327
What time...?

04:19.360 --> 04:21.661
It's late. Just...

04:21.695 --> 04:22.730
Okay, hurry!

04:22.763 --> 04:24.998
Okay, okay.

04:25.032 --> 04:26.767
Where's my shirt?

04:26.800 --> 04:28.369
Wrong door,
just... go!

04:28.402 --> 04:29.002
Mom! Mom!

04:29.036 --> 04:29.803
Love you.

04:29.837 --> 04:32.540
Mom!

04:33.607 --> 04:34.007
Mom!

04:34.041 --> 04:34.608
Mom!

04:34.642 --> 04:36.810
Shhh...

04:36.844 --> 04:38.912
Why does it always have
to start so early?

04:38.946 --> 04:40.681
Good morning.

04:40.714 --> 04:42.950
Alright, now let's see if we
can work this out without me

04:42.983 --> 04:43.851
getting a headache
before breakfast.

04:43.884 --> 04:44.718
Who was up first?

04:44.752 --> 04:45.619
I was up first.

04:45.653 --> 04:46.787
Me, me! I was up first.

04:46.820 --> 04:48.456
I get to choose what's on TV!

04:48.489 --> 04:50.090
Coffee. Let's go get some
coffee, we'll figure it out.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.362
Hot, hot, hot!

04:54.395 --> 04:55.496
Thanks Mom!

04:55.529 --> 04:56.897
You're welcome.

04:56.930 --> 04:59.667
Remember, guys when you
get home from school today,

04:59.700 --> 05:01.769
you're gonna have to be
very well behaved because

05:01.802 --> 05:03.804
I'm interviewing the nannies.
Remember what we talked about?

05:03.837 --> 05:05.973
Like Mary Poppins?

05:06.006 --> 05:08.409
Yes, something like that.

05:08.442 --> 05:09.777
She can fly?

05:09.810 --> 05:11.545
I don't know, we'll have
to wait and see, won't we?

05:14.682 --> 05:17.084
Hi!
Good morning.

05:17.117 --> 05:18.652
What're you doing here?

05:18.686 --> 05:20.654
I was just uh...

05:20.688 --> 05:23.791
driving by and I thought
I'd come by and say hello!

05:23.824 --> 05:24.558
Hello!

05:24.592 --> 05:26.059
Good morning!

05:26.093 --> 05:27.795
Yuck.

05:27.828 --> 05:29.730
So guys, what's up for today?

05:29.763 --> 05:31.799
School.
What else?

05:31.832 --> 05:33.066
School.

05:33.100 --> 05:36.504
Mom's meeting
Mary Poppins today.

05:36.537 --> 05:38.138
The nanny search.

05:38.171 --> 05:40.574
Right. Mary Poppins.

05:40.608 --> 05:42.910
Your shirt is inside out.

05:44.878 --> 05:45.913
It is!

05:45.946 --> 05:46.980
Uhh...

05:48.716 --> 05:50.618
Yeah, it's the new style guys.

05:50.651 --> 05:53.654
I'm surprised you haven't
started doing it in school yet.

05:53.687 --> 05:55.523
You guys should do
that later, not now

05:55.556 --> 05:56.724
because we have ten minutes.

05:56.757 --> 05:57.491
Go, go, upstairs.

05:57.525 --> 05:59.460
Right now.

05:59.493 --> 06:00.428
Thank you.

06:00.461 --> 06:02.029
Listen.

06:02.062 --> 06:04.732
I know you've got a lot going
on and your parents are away.

06:04.765 --> 06:06.567
Do you want some help
with the boys today?

06:06.600 --> 06:08.902
Uh... no.
No, it's okay.

06:08.936 --> 06:13.607
I just want to spend some good
quality time with Max and Rex.

06:13.641 --> 06:15.042
I feel like I'm abandoning them.

06:15.075 --> 06:16.644
Honey, you're not
abandoning them.

06:16.677 --> 06:18.846
You're doing what's
best for your children.

06:18.879 --> 06:19.880
Right.

06:19.913 --> 06:21.815
No, wait. I have
something for you.

06:21.849 --> 06:23.617
What?

06:25.786 --> 06:29.590
To celebrate your third year.

06:36.196 --> 06:38.031
A watch.

06:38.065 --> 06:39.132
It's beautiful.

06:39.166 --> 06:40.568
Three years of sobriety, babe.

06:40.601 --> 06:41.101
That is...

06:41.134 --> 06:42.636
That's huge!

06:42.670 --> 06:44.037
You should be so
proud of yourself.

06:44.071 --> 06:45.038
Wear it.

06:46.239 --> 06:48.141
Thank you.

06:48.175 --> 06:49.977
Alright, I gotta go.

06:50.010 --> 06:51.111
Have a good day.

06:51.144 --> 06:52.713
You're the best.

06:52.746 --> 06:55.683
Um... your shirt's
still inside out honey.

06:59.553 --> 07:00.654
Kids! Two minutes!

07:08.261 --> 07:10.631
Gillian, these are mostly men.

07:10.664 --> 07:12.633
Yeah.

07:12.666 --> 07:14.468
You and Greg have
getting serious now.

07:14.502 --> 07:17.037
The last thing you need
is some hot, young thing

07:17.070 --> 07:18.839
prancing in and out of here.

07:18.872 --> 07:20.474
Trust me.

07:20.508 --> 07:23.176
Remember my first nanny
became Roger's second wife.

07:23.210 --> 07:25.479
What about Cori though?
She's prettyl and she's a girl.

07:25.513 --> 07:27.781
Yeah, well I don't have
a man in my life anymore.

07:27.815 --> 07:30.884
Wouldn't it be weird to have
some strange guy walking around?

07:30.918 --> 07:33.787
The nanny services do all the
necessary background checks.

07:33.821 --> 07:35.523
You'll adjust.

07:35.556 --> 07:37.858
So um... a man nanny?

07:37.891 --> 07:39.560
Is that what you...
a man nanny?

07:39.593 --> 07:40.494
Manny.

07:40.528 --> 07:41.829
That's the scientifical term.

07:41.862 --> 07:42.996
Man plus nanny.

07:43.030 --> 07:45.032
Manny!

07:45.065 --> 07:46.967
Alright uh...

07:47.000 --> 07:49.570
Fine!
Let's do it.

07:51.104 --> 07:53.173
And here we go!

07:53.206 --> 07:55.743
Let the interviews begin!

07:55.776 --> 07:57.545
You're gonna love it!

08:10.724 --> 08:11.258
Thank you.

08:11.291 --> 08:12.159
Thank you very much.

08:15.863 --> 08:18.832
I think that kids prosper
best when they teach us.

08:18.866 --> 08:20.901
Ooh, let's see who's next.

08:25.038 --> 08:27.641
I guess the last one
wasn't so bad, I mean...

08:27.675 --> 08:30.678
No. I will call
for more names.

08:30.711 --> 08:31.712
Maybe it's a sign.

08:31.745 --> 08:33.013
Maybe I shouldn't
go back to work.

08:33.046 --> 08:34.047
No, don't be ridiculous.

08:34.081 --> 08:35.182
This is a big decision.

08:35.215 --> 08:37.317
We have to make
sure it feels right.

08:37.350 --> 08:39.152
Speaking of which, I have
a shiatsu appointment.

08:39.186 --> 08:41.254
I gotta go.

08:41.288 --> 08:42.923
We'll find someone, I promise.

08:42.956 --> 08:44.792
Don't worry.

08:44.825 --> 08:46.159
Sorry. Didn't mean
to scare you.

08:46.193 --> 08:48.128
No, that's okay.

08:48.161 --> 08:49.863
It's more than okay.

08:49.897 --> 08:51.899
You must be Mrs. Clark?

08:51.932 --> 08:53.601
Well...

08:53.634 --> 08:57.237
Hi, I'm Karen Clark.

08:57.270 --> 08:59.006
And you are...

08:59.039 --> 09:00.240
I'm Alex.

09:00.273 --> 09:03.276
And I'm late, I gotta go.

09:03.310 --> 09:04.277
Come in.

09:04.311 --> 09:06.947
Thanks.

09:10.017 --> 09:12.285
Wow. This is a
lovely house.

09:12.319 --> 09:13.821
So sorry, it's a mess.

09:13.854 --> 09:15.689
No, don't apologize.

09:15.723 --> 09:17.190
You're a working single
mom with two boys.

09:17.224 --> 09:19.126
It's completely understandable.

09:19.159 --> 09:20.994
Oh, resume.

09:21.028 --> 09:21.729
There you go.

09:21.762 --> 09:23.296
Thank you.

09:24.898 --> 09:25.799
Alex Smith?

09:25.833 --> 09:28.135
Alex Smith, yeah.

09:28.168 --> 09:30.137
Wow.

09:30.170 --> 09:31.939
This is impressive.

09:31.972 --> 09:34.307
Thanks.

09:34.341 --> 09:36.744
So tell me Alex Smith,

09:36.777 --> 09:40.013
what made you want
to be a man... nanny?

09:40.047 --> 09:40.981
Man... manny.

09:41.014 --> 09:42.616
Manny, right.

09:42.650 --> 09:44.284
Well, a number of reasons.

09:44.317 --> 09:47.054
Family, to me, has always
been really important.

09:47.087 --> 09:50.924
I'm sure you feel the same way.

09:50.958 --> 09:53.260
A lot of times we don't realize
it until it's too late,

09:53.293 --> 09:55.062
It's true.

09:55.095 --> 09:57.698
Oh, and I'm saving up to start
teacher training in the summer.

09:57.731 --> 10:00.333
I just thought if you can use me
where it allows you to have

10:00.367 --> 10:02.102
more time with your boys,
then use away, right?

10:02.135 --> 10:02.903
That's right.

10:02.936 --> 10:05.172
I'm yours.

10:05.205 --> 10:07.007
Great, okay.

10:07.040 --> 10:11.645
So two children...

10:11.679 --> 10:14.648
Is that... is that Wonder World
in that photo over there?

10:14.682 --> 10:17.951
It is. That picture
makes me so happy.

10:17.985 --> 10:19.820
That was actually
our last family

10:19.853 --> 10:22.355
vacation before
my husband passed.

10:25.826 --> 10:29.296
My parents would take
me there every year.

10:29.329 --> 10:31.164
It was a family tradition.

10:31.198 --> 10:35.202
Yeah, it's a fun place.

10:35.235 --> 10:39.773
How um... how did he
die? Your husband.

10:39.807 --> 10:41.842
He had a heart attack.

10:45.178 --> 10:47.080
Sorry to hear that.

10:47.114 --> 10:49.049
Yes.

10:49.082 --> 10:50.183
Reminds you how
precious life is.

10:50.217 --> 10:51.685
Sure does.

10:53.721 --> 10:55.255
Hey! How was school?

10:55.288 --> 10:56.356
Who is he?

10:56.389 --> 10:57.725
He might be our Cori.

10:57.758 --> 10:58.759
He's not a girl.

10:58.792 --> 11:00.327
Duh.

11:00.360 --> 11:01.862
I'm Alex.

11:01.895 --> 11:02.996
This is Max and Rex.

11:03.030 --> 11:04.064
These are my kids.

11:04.097 --> 11:05.198
Nice to meet you both.

11:06.333 --> 11:08.936
Excuse me.

11:08.969 --> 11:09.469
Hello?

11:09.502 --> 11:10.871
Here you go.

11:10.904 --> 11:12.239
Good as new.
Looks good!

11:12.272 --> 11:14.174
So what do you guys
like to do for fun?

11:14.207 --> 11:14.875
Cartoons!

11:14.908 --> 11:15.809
Videogames.

11:15.843 --> 11:17.044
They are both great choices.

11:17.077 --> 11:18.311
Maybe we'll get to play
together sometime.

11:18.345 --> 11:19.880
Can you fly?

11:19.913 --> 11:20.914
Idiot.

11:20.948 --> 11:22.149
Stop that!

11:22.182 --> 11:23.751
I hate when you do that!

11:23.784 --> 11:26.720
I'll be there as soon
as I can. Thanks. Bye.

11:26.754 --> 11:28.088
Alex, I'm sorry.

11:28.121 --> 11:29.790
We're going to have to
finish this another time.

11:29.823 --> 11:33.894
I have to go to work, so um...

11:33.927 --> 11:35.428
I've gotta find somebody
to watch the kids.

11:35.462 --> 11:38.799
Oh. Well, I could do it, if
you need some one right now.

11:38.832 --> 11:41.434
I mean I'm here.

11:41.468 --> 11:42.135
No, I...

11:42.169 --> 11:42.970
No, it's fine!

11:43.003 --> 11:44.204
The boys have met me.

11:44.237 --> 11:46.273
They didn't seem
to hate me, right?

11:46.306 --> 11:47.975
Um...

11:48.008 --> 11:50.510
Seriously, it's fine, I've got
nothing going on today and

11:50.543 --> 11:53.146
we could just consider
it a "trial run."

11:53.180 --> 11:55.115
No expectations.

11:55.148 --> 12:00.320
If things go well,
we could talk further?

12:00.353 --> 12:03.090
Um... okay Alex Smith.

12:03.123 --> 12:04.157
Deal.

12:04.191 --> 12:05.292
Okay!

12:05.325 --> 12:07.194
I told you, you were
going to feel better.

12:07.227 --> 12:08.829
I do, I do.

12:08.862 --> 12:11.498
Thank you so much.

12:11.531 --> 12:13.000
Bye!

13:18.899 --> 13:20.433
Good morning.

13:42.555 --> 13:44.992
I'm home.

13:47.594 --> 13:50.530
Oh my God!

13:50.563 --> 13:54.401
Sorry, I didn't
hear you come in.

13:54.434 --> 13:56.369
Wow Alex, I don't
even know what to say.

13:56.403 --> 13:58.538
This is like a different house.

13:58.571 --> 14:00.107
It hasn't been this
clean in years!

14:00.140 --> 14:01.341
I don't know what to say.

14:01.374 --> 14:02.943
Oh, well it's fine.

14:02.976 --> 14:06.213
I just thought you'd like
to relax after work.

14:06.246 --> 14:09.649
I just want to say, even if
you decide not to go with me,

14:09.682 --> 14:11.952
thank you very much for letting
me watch your boys tonight.

14:11.985 --> 14:14.988
Yeah, um...
you're hired.

14:15.022 --> 14:17.157
You have a job.

14:17.190 --> 14:18.525
You don't have to do that.

14:18.558 --> 14:20.160
Trust me, I do.

14:20.193 --> 14:23.030
7:45 tomorrow
morning, please.

14:23.063 --> 14:25.565
Alright.

14:25.598 --> 14:28.001
I'll see you tomorrow morning.

14:28.035 --> 14:28.936
Thank you.

14:28.969 --> 14:31.238
Of course.
Thank you.

14:31.271 --> 14:32.472
See you tomorrow!

14:32.505 --> 14:33.873
Bye.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.676
Hey!

15:09.709 --> 15:11.111
Hi, who are you?

15:11.144 --> 15:13.680
I'm Greg.
You must be Alex.

15:13.713 --> 15:17.017
Right, Karen hired me
to help with the boys.

15:17.050 --> 15:18.151
Yeah, she told me.

15:18.185 --> 15:19.519
Please, come on in Alex.

15:19.552 --> 15:21.955
Perfect. Thanks.

15:21.989 --> 15:22.922
Karen, Alex is here.

15:25.658 --> 15:26.493
Hey Alex!

15:26.526 --> 15:28.261
Hey, what's up, my man?

15:28.295 --> 15:29.963
You guys ready to go?

15:29.997 --> 15:32.165
I'd hate to get you to school
late on my first day of duty.

15:32.199 --> 15:34.067
Good morning!

15:34.101 --> 15:36.136
You guys, go get your bags,
you're going to be late.

15:36.169 --> 15:37.270
Okay.

15:37.304 --> 15:38.538
I see you two have met.

15:38.571 --> 15:39.639
Yeah!

15:39.672 --> 15:42.209
Good. Their pick
up is 2:30.

15:42.242 --> 15:43.043
Got it.

15:43.076 --> 15:44.377
Oh, Karen, leave that.

15:44.411 --> 15:46.213
I'll come back after drop
off and take care of it.

15:46.246 --> 15:47.380
That's why you hired me, right?

15:47.414 --> 15:48.982
Right. Thank you.

15:49.016 --> 15:50.984
Alright, boys,
your chariot awaits!

15:51.018 --> 15:51.985
Bye guys.

15:52.019 --> 15:53.186
Real pleasure to meet you, Greg.

15:53.220 --> 15:54.321
I'm sure I'll see you around.

15:54.354 --> 15:55.055
You will.

15:55.088 --> 15:55.555
Okay, alright.

15:55.588 --> 15:56.589
Go, go, go.

15:56.623 --> 15:58.658
See you guys, have a good day!

16:01.161 --> 16:02.695
Bye!

16:06.366 --> 16:07.334
Have a good day!

16:07.367 --> 16:09.036
Thanks.

16:09.069 --> 16:10.270
Bye hun.

16:22.782 --> 16:24.351
Hey there, Maxi-pad!

16:26.253 --> 16:27.354
Hey.

16:27.387 --> 16:28.288
You avoiding me?

16:28.321 --> 16:31.124
No, I'm just busy.

16:31.758 --> 16:35.095
You sure?

16:35.128 --> 16:38.465
Cause I really think
you're avoiding me.

16:38.498 --> 16:41.434
And that hurts my feelings.

16:41.468 --> 16:44.071
You wouldn't want to
hurt my feelings,

16:44.104 --> 16:46.073
would you?

16:46.106 --> 16:47.507
No.

16:49.376 --> 16:52.412
Hey.

16:52.445 --> 16:53.546
This looks cool.

16:53.580 --> 16:56.183
Can I have it?

16:56.216 --> 16:58.418
My Nana gave that to me.

16:58.451 --> 17:01.354
And now you're giving
it to me, right?

17:01.388 --> 17:02.489
Sure.

17:02.522 --> 17:04.223
Sweet.

17:04.257 --> 17:07.294
Thanks.

17:19.739 --> 17:22.075
[Bell You must be Ale.

17:22.108 --> 17:24.176
I'm Cori, Gillian's nanny.

17:24.211 --> 17:26.713
Gillian is Karen's
best friend, so...

17:26.746 --> 17:28.781
I guess we're gonna be
seeing a lot of each other.

17:28.815 --> 17:29.616
Oh.

17:29.649 --> 17:31.851
Lucky me.

17:31.884 --> 17:34.154
You're even cuter
than Gillian said.

17:34.187 --> 17:35.088
Excuse me?

17:35.122 --> 17:36.789
We should set up a playdate.

17:36.823 --> 17:39.192
How's later?

17:39.226 --> 17:41.394
Oh... I don't...

17:41.428 --> 17:43.196
The boys have homework.

17:43.230 --> 17:45.332
I meant for us.

17:45.365 --> 17:47.300
I'm sorry, what I meant
to say was I can't.

17:47.334 --> 17:48.568
I have a girlfriend so...

17:48.601 --> 17:49.736
So?

17:49.769 --> 17:51.338
Bring her along.

17:51.371 --> 17:53.406
I'm game.

17:55.242 --> 17:58.178
I'm kidding!

17:58.211 --> 17:59.312
So is it serious?

17:59.346 --> 18:00.280
Very.

18:00.313 --> 18:01.348
She's the one.

18:01.381 --> 18:02.549
Wow.

18:02.582 --> 18:04.284
Good for you.

18:04.317 --> 18:08.121
Personally, I think we're a
little young to settle down.

18:08.155 --> 18:09.722
How do you know what
your favorite flavor is

18:09.756 --> 18:12.659
if you haven't tried
them all, right?

18:12.692 --> 18:15.262
She cute?

18:15.295 --> 18:16.663
She's beautiful.

18:16.696 --> 18:17.697
She's perfect.

18:17.730 --> 18:19.866
Aww. That's sweet.

18:19.899 --> 18:20.800
What's her name?

18:20.833 --> 18:22.435
Come on let's
go! It's Cori!

18:22.469 --> 18:24.337
Nice to meet you, Cori.

18:24.371 --> 18:25.338
See you around, Alex.

18:25.372 --> 18:26.139
Hi Cori!

18:26.173 --> 18:27.140
Hi! How was school?

18:27.174 --> 18:28.241
We learned about dinosaurs.

18:28.275 --> 18:30.377
Hey guys!

18:30.410 --> 18:31.278
Hey!

18:31.311 --> 18:32.512
How was your day?

18:32.545 --> 18:34.281
Good, I got a high
score on Gate Jumper!

18:34.314 --> 18:35.415
Ah, really?

18:35.448 --> 18:36.183
Yup!

18:36.216 --> 18:37.550
That's cool man!

18:37.584 --> 18:38.885
Hop on in.

18:38.918 --> 18:40.420
You gotta tell me about it.

18:43.256 --> 18:45.192
See you tomorrow, Max.

18:49.262 --> 18:49.829
Who's your friend?

18:49.862 --> 18:51.498
Uh...

18:53.633 --> 18:55.768
Just a kid from school.

18:57.737 --> 18:59.206
Can we go now?

18:59.239 --> 19:00.373
Please?

19:00.407 --> 19:02.642
As you wish.

19:02.675 --> 19:04.844
Hey, so why don't you tell
me about this Greg guy?

19:04.877 --> 19:06.446
Is he and your mom
serious or what?

19:14.787 --> 19:17.490
Hey buddy.

19:17.524 --> 19:20.327
Wanna tell me what's going on?

19:20.360 --> 19:22.462
Who was that kid after school?

19:22.495 --> 19:23.763
Brett Blainesfeld.

19:23.796 --> 19:24.764
Shut up!

19:24.797 --> 19:26.333
Hey, don't yell at your brother!

19:26.366 --> 19:27.700
He's trying to help you.

19:27.734 --> 19:29.436
He's worried about you.

19:29.469 --> 19:30.670
Tell me about this Brett.

19:30.703 --> 19:33.273
What's the story, is
he giving you trouble?

19:33.306 --> 19:35.242
Sometimes.

19:35.275 --> 19:37.944
Only every day, he's the
biggest kid in class.

19:37.977 --> 19:42.582
So he's a bully, huh?

19:42.615 --> 19:46.586
You know, I've dealt with
a few bullies in my time.

19:46.619 --> 19:49.256
You wanna learn something
that'll make him stop?

19:49.289 --> 19:52.359
Now, in reality,
most are cowards.

19:52.392 --> 19:54.961
That's why they pick on kids
they know won't fight back.

19:54.994 --> 19:58.465
But you fight back, just once,
they never bother you again.

19:58.498 --> 20:00.467
Can I make him
punch his own face?

20:00.500 --> 20:03.670
As cool as that would be,
it is not very effective.

20:03.703 --> 20:06.506
But, what we do have going for
us is the element of surprise.

20:06.539 --> 20:09.376
This Brett kid, he doesn't
expect you to fight back.

20:09.409 --> 20:11.278
So time he comes
at you, I want you

20:11.311 --> 20:12.979
to make yourself a small target.

20:13.012 --> 20:13.880
Like this.

20:13.913 --> 20:15.348
See what I'm doing?

20:15.382 --> 20:16.383
Okay? Nice and small.

20:16.416 --> 20:17.717
Now, come at me
like you're Brett.

20:17.750 --> 20:19.452
I'll show you.

20:21.988 --> 20:23.490
You see what I did?

20:23.523 --> 20:25.792
Slip the back leg behind
his thigh, and push.

20:25.825 --> 20:27.494
You push his shoulder.

20:27.527 --> 20:29.562
His momentum and gravity
will take care of the rest.

20:29.596 --> 20:30.430
Okay.

20:30.463 --> 20:32.265
Now try it on me.

20:34.301 --> 20:35.635
Whoa!

20:35.668 --> 20:36.936
Ha ha ha!

20:36.969 --> 20:38.004
Shut up, Rex!

20:38.037 --> 20:39.306
We'll try it again.

20:39.339 --> 20:40.873
Hey, and you, that's
your brother here.

20:40.907 --> 20:42.842
Don't laugh at him
for making a mistake.

20:42.875 --> 20:44.043
Now, try it again okay?

20:44.076 --> 20:45.345
You're doing great.

20:45.378 --> 20:47.514
But this time, commit.
Really commit.

20:47.547 --> 20:49.749
Instead of you thinking that
you have to defend yourself,

20:49.782 --> 20:54.454
think that you have to defend
your mom from an abusive man.

20:54.487 --> 20:56.523
I'm not saying that's Greg,
I mean he doesn't, right?

20:56.556 --> 20:58.958
Greg, hurt my mom?

20:58.991 --> 21:00.393
No, never.

21:00.427 --> 21:03.930
Okay, okay.

21:03.963 --> 21:05.932
Then it's just a man,
who's attacking her.

21:05.965 --> 21:09.336
Now, when I approach, picture
me falling down in your head.

21:09.369 --> 21:11.704
Make it real.

21:11.738 --> 21:12.405
Here we go.

21:13.640 --> 21:15.375
Whoa!

21:15.408 --> 21:17.710
Yeah!

21:17.744 --> 21:19.712
I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to do that!

21:19.746 --> 21:21.848
Don't apologize.
That was great.

21:21.881 --> 21:23.316
How'd that feel?

21:23.350 --> 21:23.850
Good.

21:23.883 --> 21:24.684
Wanna do it again?

21:24.717 --> 21:25.418
Yeah!

21:25.452 --> 21:26.719
My turn! My turn!

21:26.753 --> 21:28.688
I want to try!

21:35.027 --> 21:36.529
Wow!

21:40.933 --> 21:42.802
Alex, you scared me.

21:42.835 --> 21:43.903
Sorry.

21:43.936 --> 21:45.972
This is amazing!

21:46.005 --> 21:48.040
I thought if it gives
you a chance to have

21:48.074 --> 21:50.076
a quick meal with the
boys, it's worth it.

21:50.109 --> 21:52.545
I hope you like it.

21:52.579 --> 21:55.748
If I had known it was
going to be this easy,

21:55.782 --> 21:58.017
I would've hired someone
many months ago.

21:58.050 --> 22:01.421
Thanks, but it
wouldn't have been me.

22:01.454 --> 22:03.456
That's true.

22:04.724 --> 22:07.026
Oh!

22:07.059 --> 22:08.995
I have something for you.

22:10.730 --> 22:11.864
You don't have to do that.

22:11.898 --> 22:14.333
It's just a small thank you.

22:18.037 --> 22:20.673
Your other one is kinda old and

22:20.707 --> 22:23.009
raggedy and was
getting a hole in the...

22:23.042 --> 22:25.612
Wow. I love this.

22:25.645 --> 22:26.546
You do?

22:26.579 --> 22:28.415
Yeah!

22:29.749 --> 22:31.518
I'm...

22:31.551 --> 22:33.753
I'm sorry I just um...

22:33.786 --> 22:35.121
I don't get many gifts.

22:35.154 --> 22:36.623
No?

22:36.656 --> 22:38.591
Your family's not big on
Christmas, birthdays?

22:38.625 --> 22:41.494
No, I lost them
when I was young.

22:41.528 --> 22:43.730
I'm sorry to hear that.

22:43.763 --> 22:44.964
It's just...

22:44.997 --> 22:47.534
That's why family is
so important to me.

22:47.567 --> 22:50.903
You know, why it's so precious.

22:50.937 --> 22:53.540
Of course.

22:53.573 --> 22:56.142
You know, after a
tragedy like that...

22:57.777 --> 22:59.512
Um...

22:59.546 --> 23:00.547
Oh.

23:00.580 --> 23:01.581
Sorry...

23:04.183 --> 23:05.852
Hi.

23:05.885 --> 23:06.786
Hi, babe!

23:06.819 --> 23:10.657
Oh, sorry, that's my cue.

23:10.690 --> 23:12.725
Alex, thank you so much
for everything today.

23:12.759 --> 23:15.127
No, thank you so much
for the thoughtful gift.

23:15.161 --> 23:16.696
It really means a lot to me.

23:16.729 --> 23:17.864
Of course.

23:17.897 --> 23:18.998
I'll see you tomorrow.

23:19.031 --> 23:20.800
Good night, Greg.

23:20.833 --> 23:21.834
Good night, Alex.

23:21.868 --> 23:22.769
Good night, Alex.

23:35.081 --> 23:36.115
You bought him a backpack?

23:36.148 --> 23:37.216
Yeah.

23:37.249 --> 23:39.852
Hmm.

23:39.886 --> 23:42.889
Don't you think it's a little
early to be buying him gifts?

23:42.922 --> 23:45.558
It's not gifts, he needed one.

23:45.592 --> 23:47.694
Oh, okay.

23:48.795 --> 23:50.096
What's going on here?

23:50.129 --> 23:51.864
Nothing! I'm just... you
bought him a backpack.

23:51.898 --> 23:53.666
I'm sensing a little
bit of jealousy.

23:53.700 --> 23:54.634
No, no, no.

23:54.667 --> 23:55.902
There's no jealousy here.

23:55.935 --> 23:58.738
I just was making an
observation, is all.

23:58.771 --> 24:00.540
You are the only
man in this house.

24:00.573 --> 24:01.474
Thank you.

24:01.508 --> 24:02.208
Come tell me about your day.

24:02.241 --> 24:02.875
Okay.

24:42.048 --> 24:46.152
Hey Max!

24:46.185 --> 24:50.590
Now I'm really feeling like
you're trying not to see me.

24:50.623 --> 24:51.558
Leave me alone.

24:51.591 --> 24:53.793
Hey, hey, hey!

24:53.826 --> 24:54.827
What's the hurry?

24:54.861 --> 24:56.529
You gonna be late for home ec?

24:56.563 --> 24:58.064
Gonna go bake some cookies?

24:58.097 --> 25:00.900
Just leave me alone!

25:00.933 --> 25:03.770
Oh, so you think
you can fight now?

25:03.803 --> 25:06.806
I will if you don't stop.

25:06.839 --> 25:10.009
Okay, Maxi-pad.

25:10.042 --> 25:11.110
Let's do this.

25:11.143 --> 25:13.813
Do it, Max!

25:13.846 --> 25:15.848
Fight, fight, fight!

25:23.122 --> 25:24.724
How do you like this?

25:24.757 --> 25:26.893
Ow! Stop!

25:26.926 --> 25:28.761
Teacher!

25:28.795 --> 25:30.262
Teacher, teacher, teacher!

25:36.803 --> 25:38.304
What?

25:38.337 --> 25:39.906
There's no teacher.

25:39.939 --> 25:42.642
I know. I just said that
so he wouldn't kill you.

25:46.846 --> 25:49.115
Hey guys, how was your day?

25:49.148 --> 25:51.684
He got beat up, again.

25:51.718 --> 25:52.585
What, that Brett kid?

25:52.619 --> 25:53.720
Can we just go?

25:53.753 --> 25:54.921
Wait a second.

25:54.954 --> 25:56.322
Did you use the
moves that I taught you?

25:56.355 --> 25:57.724
No, he didn't do anything.

25:57.757 --> 25:58.725
He just let Brett...

25:58.758 --> 26:00.026
Shut up, Rex!

26:00.059 --> 26:02.028
I got scared, okay?

26:02.061 --> 26:03.062
Hey, it's okay.

26:03.095 --> 26:04.196
Everybody gets scared.

26:04.230 --> 26:05.832
I get scared
all the time myself.

26:05.865 --> 26:06.866
Really?

26:06.899 --> 26:09.802
Yes!
And that's okay.

26:09.836 --> 26:11.904
It's what you do with
that fear that matters.

26:11.938 --> 26:13.740
You just have to channel it
into something constructive.

26:13.773 --> 26:18.110
Never let that fear control
you, you understand?

26:18.144 --> 26:19.812
Come on Mom!
Let's just go.

26:19.846 --> 26:22.982
Sometimes these things have a
way of working themselves out.

26:34.326 --> 26:35.695
Hey, thanks so much.

26:35.728 --> 26:37.129
I'm sure my great
aunt's doing fine.

26:37.163 --> 26:38.731
The nurses are probably
just exaggerating.

26:38.765 --> 26:40.933
It's just not a proper place
for the boys, you know?

26:40.967 --> 26:43.202
I have no problem
scratching your back,

26:43.235 --> 26:45.838
just as long as you
scratch mine later.

26:51.744 --> 26:52.845
Jasper!

26:52.879 --> 26:54.146
Jasper, come here boy!

26:54.180 --> 26:55.648
Come here, let's go.

26:55.682 --> 26:57.383
Jasper, come back!

27:10.029 --> 27:11.964
Go get it!

27:17.704 --> 27:20.206
Jasper, Jasper!

27:20.239 --> 27:21.941
Come here boy!

27:21.974 --> 27:23.943
Jasper?

27:26.245 --> 27:29.181
Oh, you found my dog.

27:29.215 --> 27:31.150
Is this your dog?

27:31.183 --> 27:33.052
He seems like a good pup.

27:33.085 --> 27:35.654
Yeah, he's pretty good.

27:37.323 --> 27:38.858
Can I have my dog back now?

27:38.891 --> 27:42.862
You see, that depends really.

27:42.895 --> 27:45.131
Let me ask you, have you um...

27:45.164 --> 27:48.234
ever had something
taken from you?

27:48.267 --> 27:50.236
Something you hold dear.

27:50.269 --> 27:52.238
Kinda like Jasper here.

27:52.271 --> 27:54.406
I just want my dog back, mister.

27:54.440 --> 27:57.143
That's what I'm talking about.

27:57.176 --> 28:00.379
There are some awfully
mean people in this world.

28:00.412 --> 28:03.149
People who like to
push others around.

28:03.182 --> 28:07.720
Others that are smaller
or weaker than they are.

28:07.754 --> 28:08.320
You're hurting him!

28:08.354 --> 28:09.956
Oh, am I?

28:09.989 --> 28:12.124
I didn't realize.

28:12.158 --> 28:14.360
I like Jasper.

28:14.393 --> 28:16.128
I want to go home.

28:16.162 --> 28:17.429
Okay, well how about this.

28:17.463 --> 28:19.165
I'll let go of Jasper.

28:19.198 --> 28:23.903
In return you give back anything
that doesn't belong to you.

28:23.936 --> 28:25.237
I don't have anything of yours.

28:25.271 --> 28:26.205
Not me, Brett.

28:26.238 --> 28:27.740
Think about it.

28:28.908 --> 28:31.377
Is this your address here?

28:31.410 --> 28:33.846
Look, I'm going to give
you Jasper back right now.

28:33.880 --> 28:36.015
On one condition, Brett.

28:36.048 --> 28:39.085
You return all the things
that do not belong to you.

28:39.118 --> 28:41.954
And if you ever find
yourself thinking of picking

28:41.988 --> 28:45.758
on someone, anyone at
school or otherwise,

28:49.195 --> 28:52.064
remember, Brett...

28:52.098 --> 28:55.101
I know where you live.

28:55.134 --> 28:57.236
And I'll be watching you.

28:57.269 --> 28:58.971
Okay?

29:00.807 --> 29:01.908
Good boy, Jasper.

29:01.941 --> 29:03.109
Jasper, come here.

29:03.142 --> 29:04.743
Come here, come here.

29:09.048 --> 29:12.351
Remember what I said Brett!

29:13.252 --> 29:14.353
Hi Alex!

29:14.386 --> 29:17.423
Hi! So, where
are the boys?

29:17.456 --> 29:18.825
Somewhere.

29:18.858 --> 29:19.992
Upstairs playing with dinosaurs.

29:20.026 --> 29:21.260
Oh, cool.

29:21.293 --> 29:22.862
Okay girls, go upstairs
and get your stuff.

29:22.895 --> 29:23.863
We have to go home.

29:23.896 --> 29:25.497
Okay.

29:32.204 --> 29:35.241
I did you a favor,
now it's your turn.

29:35.274 --> 29:38.010
Yeah, like I said, if you
need to run any errands,

29:38.044 --> 29:40.246
I can watch the girls.

29:41.413 --> 29:45.551
I want a kiss.

29:45.584 --> 29:47.519
Cori, I told you, I can't.

29:47.553 --> 29:48.955
Don't worry,

29:48.988 --> 29:50.156
I can't.

29:50.189 --> 29:51.490
On the cheek.

29:51.523 --> 29:54.093
I know you're taken.

29:54.126 --> 29:55.061
Alright.

29:59.999 --> 30:02.902
See?

30:02.935 --> 30:06.105
That wasn't so bad.

30:06.138 --> 30:09.241
If only I didn't have to
get the girls back to

30:09.275 --> 30:13.479
Gillian's before she
gets home from pilates.

30:13.512 --> 30:15.882
Until next time.

30:17.049 --> 30:18.885
Time to go!

31:28.054 --> 31:31.490
I'm... really sorry.

31:37.129 --> 31:39.231
What the heck just happened?

31:43.269 --> 31:44.503
Hello?

31:46.272 --> 31:47.573
Hello?

31:50.276 --> 31:52.979
I hear you guys!

31:53.012 --> 31:57.149
Where is Rex and Max, I wonder?

32:03.689 --> 32:06.058
Come on guys.

32:12.999 --> 32:14.300
Sorry, Greg I didn't
see you there.

32:14.333 --> 32:15.667
You should have seen your face.

32:15.701 --> 32:17.069
You were so scared.

32:17.103 --> 32:18.670
I was not scared.

32:18.704 --> 32:19.705
You were.

32:19.738 --> 32:21.440
You kind of were.

32:21.473 --> 32:23.075
Want me to show
you on the playback?

32:23.109 --> 32:24.376
No, that's okay, Alex.

32:24.410 --> 32:26.712
You should check it out,
it's pretty priceless.

32:26.745 --> 32:28.547
Alright.

32:32.384 --> 32:36.555
Okay, I guess you guys got me.

32:36.588 --> 32:39.658
I used to have a remote
control plane when I was a kid.

32:39.691 --> 32:41.293
I was pretty darn good at it.

32:41.327 --> 32:43.295
That's cool, why don't you
take this one for a spin?

32:43.329 --> 32:44.196
Really?

32:44.230 --> 32:45.131
Yeah!

32:45.164 --> 32:45.998
Guys?

32:46.032 --> 32:46.732
Yeah!

32:46.765 --> 32:48.100
Alright!

32:48.134 --> 32:49.468
So that's up and
down, left and right.

32:49.501 --> 32:51.403
Got it, okay.

32:51.803 --> 32:53.439
Watch this guys, wanna
see a pro at work?

32:53.472 --> 32:54.340
Here we go!

32:54.373 --> 32:55.541
And up we go!

32:57.076 --> 32:57.676
Here we go!

32:57.709 --> 32:59.178
Not bad!

32:59.211 --> 33:00.646
It's not that hard,
it's like riding a bike.

33:00.679 --> 33:02.048
It can be a little difficult...

33:02.081 --> 33:03.782
Alright, you guys want
to see a loop de loop?

33:03.815 --> 33:04.283
Yeah!

33:04.316 --> 33:05.517
It's not really...

33:05.551 --> 33:06.485
Here we go!

33:06.518 --> 33:08.187
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

33:09.621 --> 33:11.490
No!

33:12.624 --> 33:13.759
I...

33:13.792 --> 33:16.595
That's alright,
looks a little busted.

33:16.628 --> 33:19.198
Sorry, Alex, I didn't
mean to break your toy.

33:19.231 --> 33:21.800
That's okay, it
wasn't my toy, Greg.

33:21.833 --> 33:24.103
I got it for the boys as a gift.

33:24.136 --> 33:25.571
But that's okay.

33:25.604 --> 33:28.207
I'll take it home and see if I
can get it flying again.

33:28.240 --> 33:29.341
Yay Alex!

33:29.375 --> 33:31.177
It's alright, I'll
fix it. Right?

33:32.111 --> 33:32.678
No worries, Greg.

33:32.711 --> 33:34.613
Hey, boys, I'm sorry.

33:34.646 --> 33:35.381
It was a...

33:35.414 --> 33:37.083
it was an accident.

33:37.116 --> 33:39.251
Don't worry about
it. I'll fix it.

33:42.121 --> 33:43.455
I still can't believe it.

33:43.489 --> 33:45.591
He just gave it back to
me, said he was sorry,

33:45.624 --> 33:47.193
and he didn't bother
me again all day.

33:47.226 --> 33:48.260
Nice!

33:48.294 --> 33:49.661
Who did?

33:49.695 --> 33:51.497
The bully who's been
bothering Max after school.

33:51.530 --> 33:52.531
Someone's been bullying you?

33:52.564 --> 33:53.832
Not anymore.

33:53.865 --> 33:55.801
After this morning, he
barely even looked at me.

33:55.834 --> 33:58.670
It's like he was taken over
by aliens or something.

33:58.704 --> 34:00.706
Like I said, sometimes
all bullies need to

34:00.739 --> 34:02.574
see that you'll
stand up to them, right?

34:04.476 --> 34:06.178
Alright, let me see that drone.

34:06.212 --> 34:07.413
I'll try and fix it.

34:07.446 --> 34:08.679
You guys get washed
up for dinner, okay?

34:08.714 --> 34:09.581
Alright.

34:11.882 --> 34:15.221
So sorry, work ran late.

34:15.254 --> 34:17.089
Wow.

34:17.123 --> 34:19.125
I swear, you get more beautiful
every time I see you.

34:19.158 --> 34:21.293
Stop.

34:21.327 --> 34:23.129
Alex, do you know where
my blue dress is,

34:23.161 --> 34:24.496
the one with the gold belt?

34:24.530 --> 34:26.565
I can't find it, I
wanted to wear it tonight.

34:26.598 --> 34:27.699
There's actually a
few things missing.

34:27.733 --> 34:29.768
I do, I'm so sorry.

34:29.801 --> 34:31.469
I took them to the dry cleaners.

34:31.503 --> 34:33.371
I just wanted to get
them cleaned for you.

34:33.405 --> 34:35.474
I'll call tomorrow morning
and make sure they're ready.

34:35.507 --> 34:37.275
Thanks.

34:37.309 --> 34:39.678
You guys are all dressed up,
you got a special occasion huh?

34:39.710 --> 34:41.647
Yeah, we do.

34:41.679 --> 34:43.549
Greg made reservations
at Paliotti's.

34:43.581 --> 34:45.251
My favorite restaurant.

34:45.284 --> 34:47.152
Oh, I've never
heard of that one.

34:47.186 --> 34:47.652
Really?

34:47.686 --> 34:48.053
No.

34:48.085 --> 34:49.588
It's so good.

34:49.621 --> 34:51.456
You should take someone
special there sometime.

34:51.489 --> 34:52.424
I'll have to remember that.

34:52.458 --> 34:53.458
Alright.

34:53.492 --> 34:55.127
Call if you need anything, okay?

34:55.161 --> 34:57.229
We'll be fine,
you guys have fun.

34:57.263 --> 35:00.532
Oh, and Alex, we'll be
late alright buddy?

35:01.633 --> 35:03.402
See ya!

35:03.435 --> 35:05.304
See ya.

35:14.446 --> 35:17.749
Hey guys, why don't
you come on out here?

35:17.783 --> 35:20.386
Your mom's not the only one that
gets to have a special night.

35:20.419 --> 35:21.820
I'm gonna make you a
real special dessert.

35:50.882 --> 35:53.652
Okay guys, sit up straight.

35:53.685 --> 35:55.221
Do not spill this, okay?

35:55.254 --> 35:56.522
What's that?

35:56.555 --> 35:59.491
It's a tasty little smoothie
that I made for you.

35:59.525 --> 36:01.260
This tastes funny.

36:01.293 --> 36:03.629
Yeah? It's because there's
protein powder in there.

36:03.662 --> 36:05.564
So you can get muscles
like me. Right?

36:05.597 --> 36:07.366
Yeah!

36:09.468 --> 36:10.402
Is it good?

36:10.436 --> 36:11.937
That's good.

36:11.970 --> 36:14.806
Alright. Let's see how
I can fix this thing.

36:29.555 --> 36:31.957
Thank you sir,
compliments to the chef.

36:34.726 --> 36:36.495
I didn't know about the bully.

36:36.528 --> 36:38.597
He never told me.

36:38.630 --> 36:41.733
Feeling a little bit jealous
that they told Alex instead?

36:41.767 --> 36:43.869
Maybe?

36:43.902 --> 36:45.637
Yeah, maybe a little bit.

36:45.671 --> 36:47.673
A little bit?
Don't be.

36:47.706 --> 36:49.375
Alex is closer in age.

36:49.408 --> 36:51.310
Maybe they felt more comfortable
talking to him about it.

36:51.343 --> 36:52.010
Yeah.

36:52.043 --> 36:54.380
Don't worry.

36:54.413 --> 36:57.283
I can't believe, that's
where it all started.

36:57.316 --> 36:58.917
That was our first date.

36:58.950 --> 37:00.819
At that table.

37:00.852 --> 37:03.855
What here?
Really?

37:03.889 --> 37:04.856
Yeah!

37:04.890 --> 37:05.957
Wow!

37:05.991 --> 37:07.693
You're... just stop it.

37:38.490 --> 37:41.993
I'm going to be asking my
girlfriend to marry me tonight.

37:42.027 --> 37:42.961
So when...

37:56.675 --> 37:58.444
No, no, no, no!

38:11.690 --> 38:12.691
Hi, you've reached Karen.

38:12.724 --> 38:14.426
I can't take your
call right now,

38:14.460 --> 38:15.694
so please leave a
message. Thanks.

38:18.497 --> 38:19.698
Hi!

38:19.731 --> 38:22.534
Hi.

38:22.568 --> 38:23.669
Why are you acting strange?

38:23.702 --> 38:24.970
What's going on?

38:25.003 --> 38:26.738
Nothing. I'm fine.

38:26.772 --> 38:28.540
I'm great.

38:28.574 --> 38:30.008
You're sweating.
What's going on?

38:31.543 --> 38:33.945
What's wrong?

38:35.447 --> 38:40.419
I do remember coming here
on our first date.

38:40.452 --> 38:41.920
Sitting at that table
right over there with

38:41.953 --> 38:44.923
the most beautiful
girl in the world.

38:44.956 --> 38:48.394
This place means as much
to me as it does to you.

38:48.427 --> 38:51.663
There's a reason why I
brought you here tonight.

38:51.697 --> 38:55.100
And it's because...

38:55.133 --> 39:00.005
there's something
that I want to ask you.

39:03.041 --> 39:04.476
Karen...

39:06.945 --> 39:09.481
Oh my god, I can't believe this.

39:11.883 --> 39:13.719
Just keep going!

39:13.752 --> 39:15.754
Excuse me sir...

39:15.787 --> 39:16.955
Honey we have to go.

39:16.988 --> 39:17.656
Grab your purse.

39:17.689 --> 39:18.524
You're kidding!

39:18.557 --> 39:20.759
Come on, it's okay.

39:53.492 --> 39:56.127
Tonight was amazing.

39:56.161 --> 39:59.798
Abrupt, but it was amazing.

39:59.831 --> 40:01.733
Definetely not what I had
planned, that's for sure.

40:34.800 --> 40:36.968
Still can't believe
that happened.

40:47.846 --> 40:50.215
We're home.

40:50.916 --> 40:51.583
Hello?

40:51.617 --> 40:52.618
Oh hey!

40:52.651 --> 40:54.219
You guys are back so early.

40:54.252 --> 40:57.188
Oh my gosh, the fire alarm went
off in the middle of our dinner.

40:57.222 --> 40:58.690
It was great.

40:58.724 --> 40:59.925
Yeah, but we lived.

40:59.958 --> 41:01.059
Wow, that sucks.

41:01.092 --> 41:02.260
Sorry to hear that.

41:02.293 --> 41:04.195
Hope it didn't ruin
your night too badly.

41:04.229 --> 41:06.231
Rough day at the
office there, Alex?

41:06.264 --> 41:07.933
Oh, you're sweating!

41:07.966 --> 41:10.001
Happens trying to keep
this place shipshape.

41:10.035 --> 41:11.703
How are the boys?

41:11.737 --> 41:12.771
The boys are...
they're good.

41:12.804 --> 41:14.573
They went to bed a little early.

41:14.606 --> 41:16.274
I think they might be
coming down with something.

41:16.307 --> 41:18.844
So I was thinking
maybe... I don't know,

41:18.877 --> 41:20.579
maybe I should
stay, just in case.

41:20.612 --> 41:23.949
I could obviously
sleep on the couch.

41:23.982 --> 41:27.619
No. That's very sweet,
but not tonight.

41:27.653 --> 41:31.022
Okay, um... great.

41:31.056 --> 41:34.826
I'll be off, and I
will take these,

41:34.860 --> 41:37.896
and get them working again.

41:37.929 --> 41:39.264
Have a good night guys.

41:39.297 --> 41:41.199
Good night, Alex.

41:45.671 --> 41:46.772
Oh, come on!

41:46.805 --> 41:49.107
Where are we going?

41:49.140 --> 41:50.041
Go ahead.

41:50.075 --> 41:51.977
You want to do this right now?

41:52.010 --> 41:52.778
Yes.

41:52.811 --> 41:55.113
Alright, look.

41:55.146 --> 41:59.250
Honestly, honey,
I don't care that

41:59.284 --> 42:01.687
my plan didn't work
out at the restaurant.

42:01.720 --> 42:05.290
The fact that I was with you
is all that matters to me.

42:05.323 --> 42:07.693
It matters to me.

42:07.726 --> 42:12.964
I know you love me and
accept me, even my flaws.

42:12.998 --> 42:16.602
And you supported me
with my recovery,

42:16.635 --> 42:20.572
and stuck by me and I couldn't
have done it without you.

42:20.606 --> 42:22.307
Karen, I love you.

42:30.949 --> 42:31.950
Karen Clark?

42:34.185 --> 42:37.555
Will you make me the
happiest man in the world?

42:38.990 --> 42:42.127
And be my wife?

42:43.995 --> 42:45.363
Oh my god!

42:45.396 --> 42:47.999
It's beautiful!

42:48.033 --> 42:52.938
Honey, can you please say yes
before another alarm goes off?

42:52.971 --> 42:54.740
Yes!

42:54.773 --> 42:56.675
Yes, I will marry you!

42:56.708 --> 42:58.376
Yes?

42:58.409 --> 42:59.144
Really yes?

42:59.177 --> 42:59.878
Yes.

42:59.911 --> 43:00.345
Yes?

43:00.378 --> 43:00.979
Yes!

43:01.012 --> 43:03.281
Yes? Yes?

43:08.419 --> 43:10.188
Shh!
The boys.

43:58.770 --> 44:02.107
Is it the boys?

44:02.140 --> 44:04.075
I don't know.
Stay here.

45:06.772 --> 45:08.106
Hey, honey. The boys!

45:08.139 --> 45:09.975
No, no, no.

45:10.008 --> 45:10.408
What?

45:10.441 --> 45:11.777
Uh uh.

45:11.810 --> 45:14.112
No more sneaking out.

45:14.145 --> 45:15.013
Really?

45:15.046 --> 45:16.882
Uh huh.

45:18.817 --> 45:23.388
I thought we could tell them
over pancakes this morning.

45:23.421 --> 45:25.023
I love pancakes.

45:25.056 --> 45:27.158
I know you do!

45:30.161 --> 45:31.462
Thank you!

45:31.496 --> 45:33.932
You're welcome.

45:33.965 --> 45:35.266
Good morning!

45:35.300 --> 45:38.036
I'm just making some
breakfast for the boys.

45:38.069 --> 45:39.237
Greg, I didn't see you.

45:39.270 --> 45:40.839
I would have made you something.

45:40.872 --> 45:42.107
That's alright Alex,
don't worry about me.

45:42.140 --> 45:43.909
Oh, it's not a problem.

45:43.942 --> 45:48.780
Max, Rex, Greg spent
the night last night.

45:48.814 --> 45:50.315
Yeah, I know that, Mom.

45:50.348 --> 45:52.217
He does it a lot.

45:52.250 --> 45:54.552
Like for a long time.

45:54.585 --> 45:58.523
Well, we've been talking and...

45:58.556 --> 46:00.959
we think he should spend the
night a little bit more often.

46:00.992 --> 46:01.893
What do you think?

46:01.927 --> 46:02.961
Okay.

46:02.994 --> 46:04.062
You guys alright with that?

46:04.095 --> 46:05.831
Yeah.

46:05.864 --> 46:07.165
Are you sure?

46:07.198 --> 46:08.366
Yeah.

46:08.399 --> 46:10.235
Great!

46:10.268 --> 46:11.837
You know what guys?

46:11.870 --> 46:13.338
How about this.

46:13.371 --> 46:16.041
How about tonight, we have
a boys night here, alright?

46:16.074 --> 46:18.844
We'll get a barbeque going,
get some ribs on the barbeque.

46:18.877 --> 46:20.211
How about some
foosball later, Rex?

46:20.245 --> 46:20.578
Okay.

46:20.611 --> 46:21.579
Yeah?

46:21.612 --> 46:22.981
Yeah, and can we drink beer?

46:23.014 --> 46:23.581
Uh...

46:23.614 --> 46:24.415
Root beer, root beer.

46:24.449 --> 46:25.483
Not all men drink beer.

46:25.516 --> 46:26.117
Really?

46:26.151 --> 46:27.252
I don't.

46:27.285 --> 46:28.186
No beer?

46:28.219 --> 46:29.320
No, not for three years.

46:29.354 --> 46:30.822
Can we eat with our hands?

46:30.856 --> 46:33.424
How else do men eat?
Of course!

46:33.458 --> 46:37.262
Since it's a boys night,
can Alex come as well?

46:37.295 --> 46:40.031
You know what? I think it's just
going to be the three of us.

46:40.065 --> 46:41.432
Just your Mommy's boys.

46:41.466 --> 46:42.367
Rex, are you in?

46:42.400 --> 46:43.601
Yeah!

46:43.634 --> 46:44.535
Alright. You gonna
beat me at foosball?

46:44.569 --> 46:45.336
Yeah.

46:45.370 --> 46:46.905
Alright.

46:46.938 --> 46:48.273
There you go.

46:48.306 --> 46:49.207
Greg's right guys.

46:49.240 --> 46:50.508
Family's really important.

46:50.541 --> 46:52.177
You guys enjoy.

46:52.210 --> 46:54.212
My special scramby eggs!

46:54.245 --> 46:56.347
Let me know how it tastes.

46:56.381 --> 46:57.548
Thanks, Alex.

47:00.518 --> 47:02.320
Okay, I'm leaving.

47:02.353 --> 47:03.221
Hey!

47:03.254 --> 47:04.555
How you doing?

47:04.589 --> 47:07.993
Good, just getting
the "cue" ready.

47:08.026 --> 47:10.361
Thank you for being
so sweet to the boys.

47:10.395 --> 47:12.130
I'm looking forward to it.

47:12.163 --> 47:14.933
And next dinner
I'm cooking for you.

47:14.966 --> 47:16.534
Okay, I'll hold you to it.

47:16.567 --> 47:17.435
Have fun.

47:17.468 --> 47:19.470
Get out of here.

47:19.504 --> 47:21.306
Good luck!

47:21.339 --> 47:22.173
Do I need it?

47:33.118 --> 47:36.154
When do you think we'll
be able to fly it again?

47:36.187 --> 47:37.355
I don't know, buddy.

47:37.388 --> 47:39.590
Greg broke it pretty good.

47:39.624 --> 47:42.193
I'm going to try my best though.

47:42.227 --> 47:44.896
Listen, you guys
need to be on your

47:44.930 --> 47:46.898
best behavior tonight
with Greg, okay?

47:46.932 --> 47:48.366
Yeah, we will.

47:48.399 --> 47:50.435
Last thing I want is you
guys doing what I did.

47:50.468 --> 47:52.070
What'd you do?

47:52.103 --> 47:54.940
For a long time, it
was just me and my mom.

47:54.973 --> 47:57.042
And we did everything together.

47:57.075 --> 47:59.210
It was great.

47:59.244 --> 48:01.646
But then she met this guy, Hank,

48:01.679 --> 48:04.549
and all that started to change.

48:04.582 --> 48:06.317
It wasn't so great.

48:06.351 --> 48:07.919
He had to come
with us everywhere.

48:07.953 --> 48:10.255
She never had time
for me anymore.

48:10.288 --> 48:12.023
I know she loved me as much,

48:12.057 --> 48:14.425
but it just wasn't the
same after that.

48:16.227 --> 48:18.229
But I'm sure that won't
happen with Greg.

48:18.263 --> 48:21.166
He seems great.

48:21.199 --> 48:22.934
You guys finish
your homework, okay?

48:22.968 --> 48:25.436
I have a few other things to
take care of before I leave.

48:25.470 --> 48:26.537
Okay.

48:26.571 --> 48:28.073
And I'll see you later on, okay?

48:28.106 --> 48:29.474
Okay.

48:43.054 --> 48:46.524
You guys usually eat anything
that's in front of you.

48:46.557 --> 48:48.059
What's going on?

48:48.093 --> 48:51.029
I just feel like
Mom should be here.

48:51.062 --> 48:53.731
Yeah. It feels
kind of weird.

48:53.764 --> 48:57.135
Like, different.

48:57.168 --> 48:59.470
I get it.

48:59.504 --> 49:01.272
It's scary right?

49:01.306 --> 49:02.640
Mom's boyfriend is
around all the time,

49:02.673 --> 49:04.509
is she gonna have time for us?

49:04.542 --> 49:07.445
And, are we going to get along?

49:07.478 --> 49:09.047
But you know what guys?

49:09.080 --> 49:11.249
We actually have more in
common than you think.

49:11.282 --> 49:14.019
In fact, we have something
very special in common.

49:14.052 --> 49:16.121
You know what that is?

49:16.154 --> 49:20.625
We all, three of us, love
your Mom very, very much.

49:20.658 --> 49:22.593
Right?

49:22.627 --> 49:25.763
And nothing is
gonna change that.

49:25.796 --> 49:29.334
I think you guys are super cool.

49:29.367 --> 49:35.440
And I think maybe you guys think
I'm just a little bit cool?

49:35.473 --> 49:37.208
Just a little bit?

49:37.242 --> 49:39.210
Come on, yeah?

49:39.244 --> 49:41.612
Okay, so can we be friends?

49:41.646 --> 49:43.014
Yeah.

49:43.048 --> 49:43.781
Yeah?

49:43.814 --> 49:46.384
Alright, let's eat boys!

49:46.417 --> 49:47.585
Aha! I knew you
were hungry.

49:47.618 --> 49:48.419
It's good.

50:01.532 --> 50:03.401
Okay, let's see it.

50:05.570 --> 50:06.704
It's amazing!

50:06.737 --> 50:07.638
Isn't it beautiful?

50:07.672 --> 50:09.274
Yes!

50:09.307 --> 50:11.376
Well, I'm taking your
boy toy to the wedding,

50:11.409 --> 50:12.777
cause he is handsome.

50:12.810 --> 50:16.214
Don't. Stop it.
Don't Joke.

50:16.247 --> 50:18.549
It's starting to
get uncomfortable.

50:18.583 --> 50:20.418
Uncomfortable?

50:20.451 --> 50:22.653
He waits on you hand and
foot and you don't have

50:22.687 --> 50:24.689
to pay the price of
lying on your back for

50:24.722 --> 50:26.491
him once a week like
some deadbeat husband.

50:26.524 --> 50:27.725
Oh gosh, stop it!

50:27.758 --> 50:30.061
What's wrong?

50:30.095 --> 50:35.166
I knew he'd be in our lives.

50:35.200 --> 50:39.070
It's just... it's
starting to get invasive.

50:39.104 --> 50:41.206
He does my laundry, but like...

50:41.239 --> 50:43.040
Oh my god, you are such a prude!

50:45.110 --> 50:47.378
Loosen up!

50:51.849 --> 50:53.751
Hey.

50:53.784 --> 50:55.820
Let's go to bed.

50:57.322 --> 50:59.056
Come on.

51:09.134 --> 51:09.600
Brush your teeth.

51:09.634 --> 51:10.601
Okay.

51:14.772 --> 51:16.141
Good night, guys.

51:17.842 --> 51:19.477
Sweet dreams.

51:24.682 --> 51:26.617
Hey, Greg?

51:26.651 --> 51:28.253
Yeah buddy.

51:28.286 --> 51:30.521
Thanks for an awesome night.

51:30.555 --> 51:32.290
You too.

52:23.974 --> 52:25.876
Greg!

53:49.594 --> 53:50.961
Hey, how did it go?

53:52.597 --> 53:53.764
Greg?

53:53.798 --> 53:55.500
Greg!

53:59.570 --> 54:00.705
Hey!

54:00.738 --> 54:02.673
Get up!

54:02.707 --> 54:04.442
Greg, get up!

54:06.744 --> 54:08.779
What the hell...

54:08.813 --> 54:09.980
What happened?

54:10.014 --> 54:13.951
You know what?
You tell me.

54:13.984 --> 54:15.920
What?

54:17.822 --> 54:20.358
You got drunk.

54:20.391 --> 54:22.693
You watch my boys
and you get drunk?

54:22.727 --> 54:24.462
What, is this too much
pressure for you, Greg?

54:24.495 --> 54:25.830
Karen, hang on.

54:25.863 --> 54:26.964
Three years, Greg!

54:26.997 --> 54:31.369
Hang on, I don't remem-

54:31.402 --> 54:32.670
I didn't drink that, Karen.

54:32.703 --> 54:36.907
You need to get out of my house.

54:36.941 --> 54:38.676
Just wait, okay?

54:44.582 --> 54:46.784
Go!

54:54.925 --> 54:56.861
You're not driving.

55:13.478 --> 55:15.413
Come in.

55:17.415 --> 55:19.817
Hi, I made the boys a scramble.

55:19.850 --> 55:20.885
Would you like anything?

55:20.918 --> 55:23.821
No, not really
hungry this morning.

55:23.854 --> 55:25.089
Okay.

55:26.791 --> 55:29.427
Is everything okay?
I'm sensing something.

55:29.460 --> 55:36.967
I had to end my relationship
with Greg last night.

55:37.001 --> 55:39.737
Oh no, I'm so
sorry to hear that.

55:39.770 --> 55:41.806
What happened?

55:41.839 --> 55:44.609
When I got home he was drunk
and passed out on the floor.

55:44.642 --> 55:47.578
Are you serious?

55:47.612 --> 55:49.580
Awful.

55:49.614 --> 55:51.081
Just awful.

55:51.115 --> 55:53.951
If there is anything that
I can do for you, I'm here.

55:53.984 --> 55:55.453
I'll be right downstairs.

55:55.486 --> 56:00.024
Okay, thanks.

56:00.057 --> 56:02.126
Um.. actually Alex,

56:02.159 --> 56:07.064
did you ever see him drinking?

56:07.097 --> 56:10.535
Here or around the kids at all?

56:12.937 --> 56:15.740
Well, come to think
of it, there was one

56:15.773 --> 56:18.843
night he seemed more spirited.

56:18.876 --> 56:20.711
I don't know how I missed it.

56:20.745 --> 56:22.947
Karen, don't beat
yourself up about this.

56:22.980 --> 56:24.815
I mean, it's not your fault.

56:24.849 --> 56:26.751
He was working
so hard, you know?

56:26.784 --> 56:28.052
He was really...

56:28.085 --> 56:29.420
Three years sober!

56:29.454 --> 56:31.922
People change.

56:31.956 --> 56:33.958
Sometimes you think
you know them.

56:33.991 --> 56:36.927
You build an entire life with
them and then, they change.

56:39.530 --> 56:41.398
I'll be down in a minute.

56:45.102 --> 56:47.772
C'mon boys, we need to leave!

56:49.874 --> 56:50.941
Where's Karen?

56:50.975 --> 56:52.209
She doesn't want
to see you, Greg.

56:52.242 --> 56:53.844
Fine, then she can tell me that.

56:53.878 --> 56:55.513
Hang on, I thought
she already had.

56:55.546 --> 56:56.714
Out of my way, Alex.

56:56.747 --> 56:59.484
I know it was you.

56:59.517 --> 57:01.018
Greg, don't blame me for this.

57:01.051 --> 57:02.953
This isn't my fault.

57:02.987 --> 57:05.022
From the moment I met
you, I could tell you

57:05.055 --> 57:06.957
weren't good for this
family, but I never said

57:06.991 --> 57:08.926
anything to Karen because
it wasn't my place.

57:08.959 --> 57:11.195
I didn't trust
you with the boys.

57:11.228 --> 57:12.563
And you proved me right, Greg.

57:12.597 --> 57:13.964
And I feel sorry for you because

57:13.998 --> 57:15.500
unfortunately you need help.

57:15.533 --> 57:16.166
You're a weak man.

57:16.200 --> 57:17.502
Karen!

57:18.569 --> 57:20.538
Just let it go, Greg.

57:20.571 --> 57:22.039
I think you should move on.

57:22.072 --> 57:24.875
I mean she is.

57:24.909 --> 57:26.143
She already has.

57:26.176 --> 57:28.479
You son of a bitch.

57:29.647 --> 57:32.617
Alex!

57:32.650 --> 57:34.018
What did you do?

57:34.051 --> 57:35.586
Nothing he didn't deserve.

57:35.620 --> 57:36.821
My kids are here!

57:36.854 --> 57:39.023
Karen, I just want
to talk, okay?

57:39.056 --> 57:41.959
There's nothing to talk about.

57:41.992 --> 57:42.827
Are you okay?

57:42.860 --> 57:44.895
I did not drink!

57:44.929 --> 57:46.531
He must have drugged
me, alright?

57:46.564 --> 57:48.899
He's trying to make me
look bad to get to you.

57:48.933 --> 57:51.268
He wants you Karen,
don't you understand?

57:51.301 --> 57:53.638
You need to get out of my house,

57:53.671 --> 57:55.239
or I'm going to call the police.

57:55.272 --> 57:58.976
On it, Mom!

57:59.009 --> 58:01.546
Just get out of
my house. Please.

58:03.914 --> 58:05.282
Oh my god, Alex.

58:05.315 --> 58:06.116
Are you okay?

58:11.188 --> 58:11.956
Bedtime, monkeys.

58:11.989 --> 58:12.823
Come on, let's go.

58:12.857 --> 58:14.291
I can't.

58:14.324 --> 58:17.194
I need to draw a picture
of our family for school.

58:21.065 --> 58:23.067
Sweetheart, um...

58:23.100 --> 58:25.235
I know how much we love
Greg and how much we

58:25.269 --> 58:27.605
really want him to be a
part of our family,

58:27.638 --> 58:29.840
but I don't think he's going to
be around for a while, okay?

58:29.874 --> 58:32.242
This is Alex.

58:35.613 --> 58:38.616
Alright, bed time.
Come on.

59:33.938 --> 59:35.840
Hello.

59:35.873 --> 59:37.274
Yes, I'm interested in
an employee of yours.

59:37.307 --> 59:39.744
Alex Smith.

59:39.777 --> 59:41.846
Yes, I've got his resume
in front of me here.

59:41.879 --> 59:44.014
There seems to be a gap in
his employment history.

59:44.048 --> 59:46.250
I'm just wondering why, if there
was a problem or anything.

59:49.253 --> 59:51.188
Oh that's... that's tragic.

59:52.957 --> 59:56.727
Now, was this the same time
he worked in Colorado?

59:56.761 --> 59:59.263
It was. Okay, last question.

59:59.296 --> 01:00:04.001
Would it be possible
to get a name from you?

01:00:04.034 --> 01:00:05.269
Great.

01:00:14.044 --> 01:00:15.112
Hi girls.

01:00:15.145 --> 01:00:16.681
What are you doing here?

01:00:16.714 --> 01:00:18.315
We just thought we'd stop
by for a quick visit.

01:00:18.348 --> 01:00:20.985
Can Max and Rex come and play?

01:00:21.018 --> 01:00:24.755
Um... well no, not today.

01:00:24.789 --> 01:00:26.123
Not until they
finish their homework.

01:00:26.156 --> 01:00:28.225
Oh, it's fine.

01:00:28.258 --> 01:00:30.661
Go on upstairs and
say hi to the boys.

01:00:30.695 --> 01:00:32.062
Thank you!

01:00:38.936 --> 01:00:40.237
What do you want?

01:00:40.270 --> 01:00:42.006
Is that any way
to speak to someone

01:00:42.039 --> 01:00:43.307
you've been intimate with?

01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:45.309
A kiss is not intimate.

01:00:45.342 --> 01:00:46.911
Then you're not doing it right.

01:00:46.944 --> 01:00:48.112
Now's not a good time.

01:00:48.145 --> 01:00:49.814
You always say that.

01:00:49.847 --> 01:00:51.716
I'm gonna go get the girls.

01:00:51.749 --> 01:00:53.383
You need to leave.

01:01:09.734 --> 01:01:13.871
Let's see if this
changes his mind.

01:01:38.896 --> 01:01:40.030
Okay, time to leave.

01:01:40.064 --> 01:01:41.265
The girls are coming
down in two seconds.

01:01:41.298 --> 01:01:42.967
I mean it.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.902
Before I go, I just
wanted to tell you

01:01:44.935 --> 01:01:46.871
that Greg came to
see me yesterday.

01:01:46.904 --> 01:01:48.172
He was asking about you.

01:01:48.205 --> 01:01:51.241
Seemed desperate.
Jealous.

01:01:51.275 --> 01:01:54.044
I didn't know at the time that
he and Karen had broken up.

01:01:54.078 --> 01:01:57.147
But maybe his suspicions
were warranted.

01:01:57.181 --> 01:01:58.448
I bet he'd be pretty interested

01:01:58.482 --> 01:02:00.384
to see these
pictures on the phone.

01:02:00.417 --> 01:02:02.186
Karen too.

01:02:02.219 --> 01:02:05.155
She didn't seem like a willing
participant in many of them.

01:02:05.189 --> 01:02:08.025
Don't bother deleting them,
I already sent them to myself.

01:02:08.058 --> 01:02:10.360
So you're a "MILF" type, huh?

01:02:10.394 --> 01:02:12.997
That explains it.

01:02:13.030 --> 01:02:15.199
What do you want?

01:02:15.232 --> 01:02:16.266
What I've always wanted.

01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:17.434
You.

01:02:17.467 --> 01:02:18.502
Your place.

01:02:18.535 --> 01:02:20.337
Tonight.

01:02:20.370 --> 01:02:23.107
Or I send the pictures from my
phone to Greg's and Karen's.

01:02:25.109 --> 01:02:27.377
Girls, it's time to go!

01:02:27.411 --> 01:02:28.846
Send me your address.

01:02:28.879 --> 01:02:31.548
Oh, and I left you
a little sneak peek

01:02:31.581 --> 01:02:34.184
of what to expect
at our playdate.

01:03:11.856 --> 01:03:14.591
I'm glad you answered the door.

01:03:14.624 --> 01:03:16.293
I wasn't a hundred
percent sure you would.

01:03:16.326 --> 01:03:19.129
I don't have a choice,
you're blackmailing me.

01:03:19.163 --> 01:03:21.165
That's an ugly way to put it.

01:03:21.198 --> 01:03:24.902
Think of it as an enticement.

01:03:24.935 --> 01:03:27.104
Do you have any wine?

01:03:27.137 --> 01:03:30.474
Can we just get this
over with, please?

01:03:30.507 --> 01:03:35.012
Look, If this is gonna work,
you're gonna have to relax.

01:03:41.218 --> 01:03:42.152
Cori, can we...

01:03:42.186 --> 01:03:43.120
Nope.

01:03:43.153 --> 01:03:44.889
...do something
else or...

01:03:44.922 --> 01:03:46.156
This is so wrong.

01:03:46.190 --> 01:03:48.893
What's wrong is if you
lose your job and get

01:03:48.926 --> 01:03:50.928
booted from the nanny
agency for something

01:03:50.961 --> 01:03:54.231
that's totally in your
control to prevent.

01:03:54.264 --> 01:04:03.073
Now, close your eyes and relax.

01:04:03.107 --> 01:04:05.943
See? That
wasn't so bad.

01:04:17.254 --> 01:04:19.423
That's more like it.

01:04:25.529 --> 01:04:27.531
Okay.

01:04:30.067 --> 01:04:32.970
Well... delete them.

01:04:40.377 --> 01:04:42.512
There. One down.

01:04:42.546 --> 01:04:44.148
One?

01:04:44.181 --> 01:04:46.683
No, no, no. That
was not the deal.

01:04:46.716 --> 01:04:48.618
The deal was, I
wouldn't tell Karen.

01:04:48.652 --> 01:04:50.154
Or Greg.

01:04:50.187 --> 01:04:52.656
And I won't.

01:04:52.689 --> 01:04:55.625
As long as you keep
giving me what I want,

01:04:55.659 --> 01:04:58.295
I'll keep giving
you what you want.

01:04:58.328 --> 01:05:02.432
Besides, that was way too
much fun to do only once.

01:05:03.533 --> 01:05:05.535
Why don't you come
here, and we'll see

01:05:05.569 --> 01:05:08.372
how many we can
delete in one night?

01:05:08.405 --> 01:05:10.474
How could you?

01:05:10.507 --> 01:05:12.242
You tricked me.

01:05:12.276 --> 01:05:13.343
You're a liar.

01:05:13.377 --> 01:05:14.979
You lied to...

01:05:15.012 --> 01:05:16.146
You're a liar!

01:05:16.180 --> 01:05:17.281
You're right, I'm sorry.

01:05:17.314 --> 01:05:20.017
I'll delete them.

01:06:12.402 --> 01:06:13.537
Hello?

01:06:15.605 --> 01:06:16.540
Yes.

01:06:18.308 --> 01:06:21.711
Thank you so much for calling
me back, Mrs. Rodriguez.

01:06:21.745 --> 01:06:24.214
Yes.

01:06:24.248 --> 01:06:28.052
I was wondering about a
former employer of yours.

01:06:28.085 --> 01:06:30.187
Gwen Brown.

01:06:32.056 --> 01:06:33.757
Now, don't forget to
carry the three.

01:06:33.790 --> 01:06:35.659
Oh yeah, thanks Dad.

01:06:35.692 --> 01:06:37.094
You're welcome.

01:06:37.127 --> 01:06:38.728
You guys are doing great!

01:06:39.729 --> 01:06:42.099
Rex.

01:06:42.132 --> 01:06:46.236
You know that Alex
isn't your dad, right?

01:06:46.270 --> 01:06:48.472
Oh, I didn't see you there.

01:06:48.505 --> 01:06:50.540
You know that right, Alex?

01:06:50.574 --> 01:06:52.342
Yeah, no, no. We
were just playing.

01:06:52.376 --> 01:06:53.677
Well, that's inappropriate play.

01:06:53.710 --> 01:06:54.678
You understand?

01:06:54.711 --> 01:06:57.314
Yeah, yeah. I'm sorry.

01:06:57.347 --> 01:06:59.083
Guys, I'm sure it's
a little confusing,

01:06:59.116 --> 01:07:02.086
with Alex being here,
but he is not your dad.

01:07:02.119 --> 01:07:05.589
And he never will be, right?

01:07:05.622 --> 01:07:07.391
That's right.

01:07:07.424 --> 01:07:09.593
You hear that?

01:07:13.263 --> 01:07:15.099
I'll be right back, guys.

01:07:17.401 --> 01:07:20.337
Karen!

01:07:20.370 --> 01:07:21.705
I'm so sorry about that.

01:07:21.738 --> 01:07:24.141
It's just a stupid game
thing they do sometimes.

01:07:24.174 --> 01:07:26.810
I don't care what it
was, just as long as

01:07:26.843 --> 01:07:28.578
it's corrected and it
never happens again.

01:07:28.612 --> 01:07:29.346
Do you understand me?

01:07:29.379 --> 01:07:30.647
Absolutely.

01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:33.183
You have my word.

01:07:39.523 --> 01:07:41.458
You guys!

01:07:41.491 --> 01:07:44.694
What did I say about
you calling me dad?

01:07:44.728 --> 01:07:47.497
You said that it was okay
as long as Mom wasn't around.

01:07:47.531 --> 01:07:48.332
Right.

01:07:48.365 --> 01:07:50.467
So what was that?

01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:51.701
Rex?

01:07:51.735 --> 01:07:53.137
I didn't know she
was there, I swear!

01:07:53.170 --> 01:07:56.173
You didn't know she was there?

01:07:56.206 --> 01:07:57.674
You guys gotta be
careful, because

01:07:57.707 --> 01:07:59.809
if it happens again I'm
gonna have to kill you.

01:08:03.147 --> 01:08:05.115
I'm just joking.

01:08:05.149 --> 01:08:06.750
Seriously. Don't
ever do it again.

01:08:06.783 --> 01:08:08.285
Promise me?

01:08:08.318 --> 01:08:10.320
Pinkie-swear.

01:08:46.856 --> 01:08:47.890
Thank you.

01:08:53.897 --> 01:08:54.898
Karen, please...

01:08:54.930 --> 01:08:57.133
I said I needed space.

01:09:00.237 --> 01:09:01.470
I need to talk to you.

01:09:01.505 --> 01:09:02.805
If I wanted to talk to you,

01:09:02.839 --> 01:09:04.274
I would've returned
your phone calls.

01:09:04.308 --> 01:09:05.475
This isn't about us.

01:09:05.509 --> 01:09:06.743
It's about Alex.

01:09:06.776 --> 01:09:10.514
You need to hear
this Karen, please.

01:09:10.546 --> 01:09:11.948
You and the boys are in danger.

01:09:11.981 --> 01:09:13.350
Don't bring the boys into this.

01:09:13.383 --> 01:09:14.818
You may not want to
believe any of this,

01:09:14.850 --> 01:09:16.420
but you need
to hear it, alright?

01:09:16.453 --> 01:09:18.955
I've had a bad feeling about
Alex since the beginning.

01:09:18.988 --> 01:09:20.323
So I looked into him.

01:09:20.357 --> 01:09:21.758
What do you mean
you looked into him?

01:09:21.791 --> 01:09:22.826
He is a kid.

01:09:22.859 --> 01:09:24.361
The last family he worked for.

01:09:24.394 --> 01:09:25.828
A mother and two
boys, just like you.

01:09:25.862 --> 01:09:26.630
Okay.

01:09:26.662 --> 01:09:27.863
She killed herself.

01:09:27.897 --> 01:09:29.933
That's very sad.
Very sad.

01:09:29.966 --> 01:09:32.301
I talked to the housekeeper.

01:09:32.336 --> 01:09:33.970
She knew Alex.

01:09:34.002 --> 01:09:35.604
She didn't want
to talk about him.

01:09:35.639 --> 01:09:36.973
She was afraid of him.

01:09:37.006 --> 01:09:38.707
She finally told me that
every time she saw him look

01:09:38.742 --> 01:09:41.377
at the mother, it was like
he was in love with her.

01:09:41.411 --> 01:09:42.879
Do you understand what
I'm saying to you?

01:09:42.912 --> 01:09:44.747
Do you hear yourself?
Do you?

01:09:44.781 --> 01:09:45.849
Do you hear what you're saying?

01:09:45.881 --> 01:09:46.983
You sound crazy.

01:09:47.015 --> 01:09:48.385
I'm not crazy.

01:09:48.417 --> 01:09:51.654
You need to read this
and listen to me.

01:09:54.391 --> 01:09:57.427
If you want me to listen to
you or to help you, you have

01:09:57.461 --> 01:09:59.596
to start taking responsibility
for your own actions.

01:09:59.629 --> 01:10:01.631
Stop blaming other people!

01:10:01.665 --> 01:10:03.900
Please go!
Please just go.

01:10:09.806 --> 01:10:11.241
Listen, Karen.

01:10:11.275 --> 01:10:15.679
Just... please go.

01:10:32.862 --> 01:10:34.798
Alex?

01:10:39.936 --> 01:10:41.671
Hi.

01:10:41.705 --> 01:10:45.309
I thought now that the boys
were down, we could eat.

01:10:45.342 --> 01:10:48.312
Wow, this is...

01:10:48.345 --> 01:10:50.580
Amazing?

01:10:50.614 --> 01:10:52.882
No. It's wrong.

01:10:54.083 --> 01:10:56.320
Wrong?

01:10:56.353 --> 01:10:59.856
I think you've
gotten the wrong idea.

01:10:59.889 --> 01:11:04.761
And this isn't
working out anymore.

01:11:06.463 --> 01:11:09.699
Um... I don't
understand...

01:11:12.068 --> 01:11:14.471
Things have just gotten...

01:11:14.504 --> 01:11:16.440
a bit uncomfortable.

01:11:16.473 --> 01:11:19.476
I don't really like the
direction that you're headed

01:11:19.509 --> 01:11:23.380
with the boys, and I think
it all just needs to stop.

01:11:27.751 --> 01:11:31.287
I think you need to leave.

01:11:33.723 --> 01:11:35.792
Karen...

01:11:35.825 --> 01:11:37.794
Whatever's going on,
we can work through this.

01:11:37.827 --> 01:11:38.928
We can. Surely.

01:11:38.962 --> 01:11:40.063
No, we can't work through this.

01:11:40.096 --> 01:11:42.832
I'm you employer, and I am not

01:11:42.866 --> 01:11:45.769
in need of your
services anymore.

01:11:47.804 --> 01:11:51.841
You're fired, Alex.

01:11:51.875 --> 01:11:53.810
Don't do this Karen.

01:11:53.843 --> 01:11:56.680
The boys just lost Greg.

01:11:56.713 --> 01:11:58.482
And now this?

01:11:58.515 --> 01:12:01.317
I know what's best
for my children.

01:12:05.422 --> 01:12:06.923
Can I say goodbye
to the kids, please?

01:12:06.956 --> 01:12:07.491
No.

01:12:07.524 --> 01:12:08.825
Please?

01:12:08.858 --> 01:12:10.560
No, I don't want you to
make it harder for them.

01:12:10.594 --> 01:12:13.329
I'll make sure that they
know that you said goodbye.

01:12:18.402 --> 01:12:22.539
Alex... I need the key.

01:12:34.451 --> 01:12:36.352
I'm sorry.

01:13:54.664 --> 01:13:55.932
Howdy, boys!

01:13:55.965 --> 01:13:57.701
How come you're
picking us up early?

01:13:57.734 --> 01:14:00.036
Yeah, mom never
lets us miss school.

01:14:00.069 --> 01:14:03.840
Because I am gonna take you guys
to my favorite place on earth.

01:14:03.873 --> 01:14:05.909
And we're gonna
have an amazing time.

01:14:05.942 --> 01:14:07.477
So, who wants to go
to Wonder World?

01:14:56.993 --> 01:14:58.261
Oh my god!

01:15:55.952 --> 01:15:56.986
Karen?

01:15:57.020 --> 01:15:59.956
Greg, I think you're right.

01:15:59.989 --> 01:16:02.125
I looked him up.

01:16:05.695 --> 01:16:06.730
Alex, what are you doing here?

01:16:06.763 --> 01:16:08.131
Karen?

01:16:08.164 --> 01:16:09.899
At first, I couldn't
find my key.

01:16:09.933 --> 01:16:11.234
But then I remembered...

01:16:13.002 --> 01:16:15.271
I made a copy.

01:16:20.409 --> 01:16:22.145
Karen?

01:16:22.178 --> 01:16:23.813
Karen, can you hear me?

01:16:23.847 --> 01:16:24.781
Karen!

01:16:25.682 --> 01:16:27.316
Karen!

01:16:33.422 --> 01:16:35.825
Karen!

01:16:37.093 --> 01:16:38.728
Karen, you open this door!

01:16:41.998 --> 01:16:43.733
Shh. It's okay, Karen.

01:16:43.767 --> 01:16:45.902
I know this is
moving fast, I do.

01:16:45.935 --> 01:16:47.103
But I need to tell you.

01:16:47.136 --> 01:16:48.938
I can see the way
you look at me.

01:16:48.972 --> 01:16:50.674
And I can see it
in your eyes, okay?

01:16:50.707 --> 01:16:52.408
It's love, and I
feel the same thing.

01:16:52.441 --> 01:16:56.212
No, it's not love, Alex.

01:16:56.245 --> 01:16:58.147
Karen, would you quit...

01:16:58.181 --> 01:17:02.118
Quit playing these
games Karen, please.

01:17:02.151 --> 01:17:04.120
The sooner you stop
and admit this,

01:17:04.153 --> 01:17:05.321
the sooner we can be together.

01:17:05.354 --> 01:17:06.990
The sooner we can
be a family, okay?

01:17:07.023 --> 01:17:08.925
No, it's not like that.

01:17:08.958 --> 01:17:10.794
I thought you wouldn't
mind sacrificing

01:17:10.827 --> 01:17:13.797
a half day of school
for some family time.

01:17:13.830 --> 01:17:15.064
What?

01:17:15.098 --> 01:17:18.267
The boys are waiting
patiently down in the car.

01:17:18.301 --> 01:17:19.869
Do not...

01:17:19.903 --> 01:17:21.404
Do not hurt my babies!

01:17:21.437 --> 01:17:22.972
Karen, I don't
want to hurt them.

01:17:23.006 --> 01:17:25.174
I love them like
they're my own sons.

01:17:25.208 --> 01:17:27.276
I just want to make
some memories.

01:17:27.310 --> 01:17:29.212
I want us to make some memories.

01:17:29.245 --> 01:17:32.415
Some place out of this world.

01:17:32.448 --> 01:17:34.217
Wonder World?

01:17:34.250 --> 01:17:37.186
Please, this is insane.

01:17:37.220 --> 01:17:38.822
You understand that?
This is insane.

01:17:38.855 --> 01:17:40.023
Please, just stay here.

01:17:40.056 --> 01:17:41.190
We can talk.

01:17:41.224 --> 01:17:42.726
Pleaseplease, please.

01:17:42.759 --> 01:17:44.861
No!

01:17:56.172 --> 01:17:57.974
Karen?

01:18:07.316 --> 01:18:09.052
Karen?

01:18:09.085 --> 01:18:13.456
Max? Rex?

01:18:29.372 --> 01:18:31.407
I just want to make
some memories.

01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:33.176
I want us to make some memories.

01:18:33.209 --> 01:18:35.945
Some place out of this world.

01:18:35.979 --> 01:18:37.380
Wonder World?

01:18:37.413 --> 01:18:38.714
Oh my god.

01:18:50.994 --> 01:18:52.228
We're here!

01:18:56.866 --> 01:18:58.401
Max, Rex! Wait!

01:18:58.434 --> 01:19:00.303
I want to go on the
roller coaster first!

01:19:01.037 --> 01:19:02.005
It's not open!

01:19:02.038 --> 01:19:03.172
Of course it is!

01:19:04.373 --> 01:19:06.776
How are we gonna get in?

01:19:06.810 --> 01:19:08.978
It's locked.

01:19:13.149 --> 01:19:15.284
You say it's locked, huh?

01:19:15.318 --> 01:19:19.055
Lucky for you guys,
I have a special key.

01:19:19.088 --> 01:19:20.990
Stand back.

01:19:27.396 --> 01:19:29.032
Yes, his name is Alex Smith.

01:19:29.065 --> 01:19:31.100
They're headed to Wonder World
and he is armed.

01:19:31.134 --> 01:19:31.801
Please hurry.

01:19:43.312 --> 01:19:45.148
It's closed.

01:19:45.181 --> 01:19:47.416
What? No it's not.

01:20:18.181 --> 01:20:19.415
Hey guys.

01:20:19.448 --> 01:20:21.084
Come this way.

01:20:21.117 --> 01:20:23.119
Got some memories to capture.

01:20:23.152 --> 01:20:26.322
Come on!
Right here!

01:20:38.267 --> 01:20:39.168
Alright guys.

01:20:39.202 --> 01:20:40.937
Family photo time.

01:20:40.970 --> 01:20:43.139
Big smiles!

01:20:45.574 --> 01:20:47.376
Nope, nope, nope nope.

01:20:47.410 --> 01:20:48.544
Okay, we'll try again.

01:20:48.577 --> 01:20:50.213
Guys, big smiles, okay?

01:20:50.246 --> 01:20:52.215
This is gonna be for
the Christmas card.

01:20:52.248 --> 01:20:54.918
One, two, three.

01:20:56.920 --> 01:20:58.321
Okay, okay, um...

01:20:58.354 --> 01:20:59.622
Max, Rex?

01:20:59.655 --> 01:21:01.590
Why are you guys making
this so difficult?

01:21:08.197 --> 01:21:12.435
As soon we get this done,
we can go on the rides, okay?

01:21:12.468 --> 01:21:14.470
But that's not going to
happen until you smile,

01:21:14.503 --> 01:21:18.674
both of you, and we get
a nice family photo.

01:21:18.707 --> 01:21:20.176
One more chance.

01:21:21.277 --> 01:21:22.411
I want to go home.

01:21:22.445 --> 01:21:23.646
You want to go home?

01:21:23.679 --> 01:21:25.281
Well, that's not gonna
happen until you

01:21:25.314 --> 01:21:28.284
smile and we get a
nice family photo!

01:21:30.286 --> 01:21:32.021
One more time, okay?

01:21:32.055 --> 01:21:35.158
I'm gonna put this camera up,
and we're all gonna smile,

01:21:35.191 --> 01:21:37.026
and we're gonna be a
nice happy family, okay?

01:21:37.060 --> 01:21:38.327
Hey, hey hey!

01:21:38.361 --> 01:21:39.929
No tears. Rex!

01:21:39.963 --> 01:21:41.397
No tears!

01:21:43.099 --> 01:21:44.500
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

01:21:44.533 --> 01:21:45.701
I want to go home too.

01:21:45.734 --> 01:21:46.936
Let's go sweetie.

01:21:46.970 --> 01:21:47.937
Okay, Karen, Karen, Karen?

01:21:47.971 --> 01:21:49.172
That's not an option, Karen.

01:21:49.205 --> 01:21:50.539
Alex, please.

01:21:50.573 --> 01:21:52.375
All the kids rides are closed.

01:21:52.408 --> 01:21:53.476
Let's come back tomorrow.

01:21:53.509 --> 01:21:54.978
No, we can't.

01:21:55.011 --> 01:21:55.678
Hey, come here!

01:21:55.711 --> 01:21:56.645
Ow!

01:21:56.679 --> 01:21:57.947
Leave her alone!

01:21:57.981 --> 01:22:00.049
No Max, we're a family now.

01:22:00.083 --> 01:22:01.284
I will never leave you alone.

01:22:01.317 --> 01:22:02.118
Get away from her!

01:22:02.151 --> 01:22:02.618
No Max! Please!

01:22:06.189 --> 01:22:09.158
Run! Run!

01:22:12.295 --> 01:22:13.129
Please.

01:22:13.162 --> 01:22:13.629
Karen.

01:22:13.662 --> 01:22:14.230
Alex, please.

01:22:29.145 --> 01:22:30.213
No, no, no.

01:22:30.246 --> 01:22:31.414
It's okay, Karen.

01:22:31.447 --> 01:22:33.249
It's okay, I'm doing
the guy a favor, okay?

01:22:33.282 --> 01:22:34.517
He is so annoying!

01:22:34.550 --> 01:22:36.019
I can't love anybody
that's killed anybody.

01:22:36.052 --> 01:22:37.586
Please leave him.

01:22:37.620 --> 01:22:39.288
I choose you.

01:22:39.322 --> 01:22:40.990
I want it to be you.

01:22:41.024 --> 01:22:43.026
I knew it from the
moment that I met you.

01:22:43.059 --> 01:22:45.194
I want you to help me
raise my boys, please.

01:22:45.228 --> 01:22:47.396
Please, leave him.

01:22:47.430 --> 01:22:51.300
Karen, you have no idea
how happy that makes me.

01:22:51.334 --> 01:22:54.570
I can't tell you how
happy that makes me.

01:22:54.603 --> 01:22:56.005
But I have to kill him.

01:22:56.039 --> 01:22:57.106
No, no!

01:22:59.675 --> 01:23:01.077
Don't ever mess with my family!

01:23:04.713 --> 01:23:06.315
Greg, come on.

01:23:06.349 --> 01:23:07.516
Stay with me.

01:23:07.550 --> 01:23:08.684
Help, please!

01:23:08.717 --> 01:23:09.752
He's got a gun!

01:23:09.785 --> 01:23:11.020
Call it in.

01:23:11.054 --> 01:23:12.321
Stay over here by the car, okay?

01:23:13.789 --> 01:23:15.991
Let's get some help.

01:23:19.295 --> 01:23:20.129
He's over there!

01:23:20.163 --> 01:23:20.663
I've got them.

01:23:20.696 --> 01:23:21.664
Check it out!

01:23:25.134 --> 01:23:26.569
Got nothing.

01:23:28.471 --> 01:23:30.239
He was right there!

01:23:30.273 --> 01:23:32.108
You have to find him!

01:23:46.155 --> 01:23:47.423
Hi, you've reached Karen.

01:23:47.456 --> 01:23:48.124
And Greg.

01:23:48.157 --> 01:23:48.824
And Max!

01:23:48.857 --> 01:23:49.858
And Rex!

01:23:49.892 --> 01:23:50.826
We're not home, so please

01:23:50.859 --> 01:23:53.596
Leave a message!

01:24:07.610 --> 01:24:10.113
Hello, my name's
Charlie Highsmith.

01:24:10.146 --> 01:24:12.648
I'm here for the
caregiving position.
