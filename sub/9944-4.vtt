Come and watch pikeys making a mess

00:08.260 --> 00:11.855
of the lives they were given by
'im upstairs...

00:11.940 --> 00:14.898
And kids they're convinced
aren't actually theirs.

00:14.980 --> 00:16.094
Wicked!

00:16.180 --> 00:17.499
Piss off!

00:17.580 --> 00:21.368
What sounds on Earth
could ever replace

00:21.460 --> 00:24.497
kids needing money
or wives in your face?

00:24.580 --> 00:26.935
Cos this, people reckon -
me included -

00:27.020 --> 00:29.488
is why pubs and drugs

00:29.580 --> 00:31.172
were kindly invented...

00:31.260 --> 00:33.774
To calm us all down
and stop us going mental.

00:33.860 --> 00:38.570
These are Chatsworth Estate's
basic essentials.

00:38.660 --> 00:44.815
We are worth every penny
for grinding your axes...

00:44.900 --> 00:46.379
You sit on our head,

00:46.460 --> 00:49.133
but... you pay the taxes.

00:49.220 --> 00:50.619
CHEERING

00:50.700 --> 00:53.373
Imagine Britain
without Chatsworth buccaneers

00:53.460 --> 00:56.691
who'd come on your face
for the price of a beer, eh?

00:56.780 --> 00:58.259
Eh!

00:58.340 --> 01:02.094
Make poverty history.
Cheaper drugs now!

(Liam) 'Money was invented by
the Algerian Empire, back in 1200BC.

'Heavy coins, known as shekels.

'Paper money wasn't invented

'The first recorded use of money

'Some people say having
no money isn't that bad.

'People who say that
usually live in nice houses,

'with two cars, and can afford
to talk out their arses.'

01:56.180 --> 02:00.571
Er, forget it. You start sticking
your giro in here, then we'll talk.

'Let's face it. Being poor is shit.

Party's a goer.
lan, you all right to close tonight?

02:24.180 --> 02:27.616
Dunno. Switching off lights,
locking doors - it's a big responsibility(!)

02:27.700 --> 02:30.931
Here, keep 'em. You fancy it,
you can move into the spare room.

02:31.020 --> 02:33.898
We should discuss this first, eh?

02:36.580 --> 02:39.253
Fine. Take the room.

02:39.340 --> 02:43.253
If you manage to get a girlfriend,
you might be glad of it.

02:43.340 --> 02:44.898
You've only got enough for a half.

Lottery! Idiot tax, isn't it?

02:58.500 --> 03:00.218
Sign of a poor economy.

03:00.300 --> 03:03.053
'That ticket still remains unclaimed.'

03:03.140 --> 03:07.895

04:59.020 --> 05:01.534
Well, you know, the truth
is, you know...

05:04.580 --> 05:07.413
The truth is, see,
I didn't want to boast or nothing.

05:07.500 --> 05:10.412
It's just...
Any chance of a chaser in this?

05:10.500 --> 05:12.252
(Man) Get him a double.

05:12.340 --> 05:15.810
I've been brought up properly.
It's vulgar to mention money, innit?

05:15.900 --> 05:18.255
Still, you know what they say...

05:18.340 --> 05:20.729
you gotta be in it to win it!

05:21.860 --> 05:24.613
Way back in Ancient Greece, like,

05:24.700 --> 05:28.852
it was the gods themselves
who used to reward the heroes...

05:28.940 --> 05:30.896
(Karen) Do you believe this?

05:30.980 --> 05:32.732
I have no idea.

05:32.820 --> 05:35.414
Keep his tab open. We're quids in here.

05:35.500 --> 05:37.570
Right. Be back late. Maybe morning.

05:37.660 --> 05:41.050
Maybe not till afternoon.
Big Jim's parties are legendary.

05:41.140 --> 05:44.371
Don't suppose you could lend us
half a million quid or so?

05:50.060 --> 05:52.654
Don't tell me people
are actually buying this.

05:52.740 --> 05:55.732
Must be round most of the estate.
Busiest night we've had in ages.

Does Mum know yet?

06:05.140 --> 06:07.700
SCREAMS

06:07.780 --> 06:11.773
Yeah. She knows. Tried telling her
it was all nonsense, but, y'know.

06:11.860 --> 06:16.058
Should have a word with him before
he does something really stupid.

06:16.140 --> 06:17.255
Christ, the croupier!

06:20.740 --> 06:22.935
I'm not saying it was the Almighty,

06:23.020 --> 06:26.933
but there's a certain order to the cosmos.

06:27.020 --> 06:28.214
Hello, baby.

06:28.300 --> 06:30.814
- Can I see it?
- See what?

06:30.900 --> 06:34.051
- The winning ticket.
- Yes, show us the ticket!

06:34.140 --> 06:37.610
The winning... See it? Right.

06:37.700 --> 06:38.894
So?

It's in me other jeans.

06:43.460 --> 06:44.449

06:48.060 --> 06:51.211

fucking nagging by the age of four.

06:51.300 --> 06:53.973
LAUGHTER

06:54.060 --> 06:55.459
I'm not nagging.

06:55.540 --> 06:58.293
At home, with the housekeeping,
she's got this little tin.

06:58.380 --> 07:01.895
It's all, "got a tin,
got a tin, got a fucking tin..."

07:02.940 --> 07:04.658
Someone has to keep charge of the money.

07:04.740 --> 07:07.254

- Dad...

07:07.340 --> 07:10.537
"Dad!" Yap, yap, like a Chihuahua.

07:10.620 --> 07:16.058
Go on! Go back and cut up
yer discount coupons!

07:16.140 --> 07:19.530
If she won the lottery
it'd sit in that bloody tin.

07:30.140 --> 07:31.368
Handing in my notice.

07:31.460 --> 07:34.258
You can't quit. We've got
lottery fever going on here.

07:34.340 --> 07:35.455
All arses on deck.

07:35.540 --> 07:38.338
I'm heir to a fortune. Don't need this job.

07:38.420 --> 07:39.614
I'll give you a pay rise.

07:39.700 --> 07:41.133
Three quid an hour.

07:42.580 --> 07:43.615

Shit! Shit!

08:54.980 --> 08:57.858
It's not your fault, babe.

08:57.940 --> 09:01.933
I mean, who has a fucking karaoke
machine in their flat, eh?

09:02.020 --> 09:04.170
Don't. I can still hear him singing.

09:04.260 --> 09:06.296
Ah, home sweet home.

09:09.060 --> 09:10.778
Come on.

09:14.660 --> 09:15.809
I'm sorry about that.

09:17.260 --> 09:20.411
Maybe we can finish off,
you know, tomorrow night?

09:20.500 --> 09:22.650
Maybe. If you get yer own bed.

09:36.420 --> 09:37.694

10:21.300 --> 10:24.736
- Your secret's safe with me.
- Fine.

10:24.820 --> 10:26.651
Should be more careful in future.

10:26.740 --> 10:28.139
Sure.

10:29.540 --> 10:32.134
How long have you known for?
I can't believe it.

10:32.220 --> 10:36.099
And I never guessed, and usually,
I have a radar for these things.

10:36.180 --> 10:37.215
Karen.

10:37.300 --> 10:40.098
Hey, you don't need to be ashamed.

10:40.180 --> 10:43.252
I'm not ashamed.
I just need to take a piss, all right?

13:32.940 --> 13:34.134
Well, I can get you a bed.

13:34.220 --> 13:36.131
- What's the catch?
- No catch.

13:36.220 --> 13:37.209
Really.

13:40.340 --> 13:42.695
I can't believe
you fucked some guy in our bed.

13:42.780 --> 13:44.657
- Keep it down.
- You're fucking disgusting.

13:44.740 --> 13:45.889
And you're an homophobe!

13:45.980 --> 13:49.097
Animal, vegetable, mineral,
I couldn't give a monkey's twat

13:49.180 --> 13:51.694
what you're into,
but not in our fucking bed!

13:51.780 --> 13:54.977
You're right. I'll make it up to you,
but I need to know

13:55.060 --> 13:58.655
you're not going to spread this around.
Promise me, Karen. Please.

13:58.740 --> 14:00.537
Hey, what's up?

14:00.620 --> 14:02.690
Gayboy here fucked
some guy in our bed.

14:02.780 --> 14:05.248
- Fuck's sake!
- You're gay? Really?

14:05.340 --> 14:08.059
Hello? Not the point. In <i>our</i> bed.

14:08.140 --> 14:10.131
Thought you weren't gonna
tell anyone.

14:10.220 --> 14:11.733
He's me husband. I have to tell him.

14:11.820 --> 14:13.458
I don't really care either way.

14:13.540 --> 14:15.371
That's not what
I'm worried about. Jesus!

14:15.460 --> 14:17.212
You're the guy who used our fucking bed.

14:17.300 --> 14:20.372
You don't get to act all pissed off here.

14:20.460 --> 14:23.691
I tell him everything, we're totally
honest with each other. So deal with it.

14:23.780 --> 14:25.054
You tell him everything?

14:25.140 --> 14:26.368
- Really?
- Yeah.

14:26.460 --> 14:29.213
How you used to suck off
the delivery guy for a discount?

14:29.300 --> 14:31.495
That old guy you gave
a hand-job to for a bet?

14:31.580 --> 14:33.093
What about you shagging my dad?

14:37.420 --> 14:39.217
Shit, I didn't mean to...

14:39.300 --> 14:41.131
It's all right. I'm cool.

14:52.140 --> 14:55.257
The longer it goes on,
the worse it's gonna get.

14:55.340 --> 14:57.979
Not just for you. For all of us.

14:58.060 --> 14:59.698
You didn't win the lottery.

15:01.460 --> 15:04.020
It's all about perception, Deb, innit?

15:04.100 --> 15:06.933
If everyone says the sky is green,
then the sky is green.

15:07.020 --> 15:10.057
No, the sky would be blue.
Everyone would just be wrong.

15:10.140 --> 15:11.459
You have to tell them.

15:14.740 --> 15:15.729
Debbie...

15:18.620 --> 15:23.296
Oh, come on, having money changes
things. People look up to me now.

15:23.380 --> 15:26.178
Well done! You've worked out
that people pay attention

15:26.260 --> 15:28.091
when they <i>think</i> you've got cash.

15:28.180 --> 15:30.250
What about the one when you realise
every action has a consequence?

15:30.340 --> 15:34.777
Fuckin' hell, it's like being interrogated
by the inventor of Scrabble.

15:34.860 --> 15:36.054

15:36.140 --> 15:39.530
- Yes?!
- It's my kitten, mister.

15:39.620 --> 15:42.737
Vet says he needs a new heart.
Will you help him, please?

15:42.820 --> 15:44.219
Do I look like I've got charity

15:44.300 --> 15:46.575
- stamped across my fucking forehead?
- No.

15:46.660 --> 15:49.538
My hubby's lost both his legs
in an industrial accident.

15:49.620 --> 15:50.894
Oh! Bloody hell!

15:50.980 --> 15:54.575
The Government's stopped
his disability benefit, the bastards.

15:54.660 --> 15:57.333
- You're his only hope!
- Oh!

15:57.420 --> 15:59.411

16:17.220 --> 16:18.255
(lan) Yeah. It's all right.

16:18.340 --> 16:24.176
- What's up with you? It's a free bed.
- Nothing, I'm just worried about stuff.

16:24.260 --> 16:26.455
Never mind.

16:26.540 --> 16:28.212
It's springy.

16:28.300 --> 16:29.733
- Eh?
- The bed.

16:29.820 --> 16:31.538
I had a bounce on it.

16:31.620 --> 16:33.258
Very springy.

16:34.180 --> 16:35.408
Better get a move on.

16:37.260 --> 16:40.252
- Who did you say this belonged to?
- Told you. Mate of mine.

16:40.340 --> 16:42.774
- He's moving to Costa Rica. Don't need it.
- Costa Rica?

16:44.580 --> 16:47.378
You...!

16:47.460 --> 16:51.055
You can't even make up a convincing
sounding story, can you? Admit it.

16:51.140 --> 16:52.892
- You nicked it.
- I did not.

16:52.980 --> 16:55.369
You're the worst liar I've ever met!
We've gotta dump this.

16:55.460 --> 16:58.054
- I'm not risking carting around some knock-off.
- Fuck you!

16:58.140 --> 17:00.893
I bought it, OK!

17:00.980 --> 17:03.892
I fucking paid for it,
50 quid from a mate.

17:03.980 --> 17:06.016
I bought you the fucking bed.

17:06.099 --> 17:08.772
- OK. Calm down.
- You dick!

17:08.859 --> 17:11.249

Why would you buy me a bed?

you'd know something about it.

No, no, Jesus! I meant,
I thought you'd know what to do.

20:06.420 --> 20:08.729

You told the wife, told the police?

20:30.700 --> 20:31.769
No.

20:31.860 --> 20:34.738
Don't. She'll only panic
and they'll only cock it up.

20:34.820 --> 20:38.813

neither of those has a happy ending.

he's staying with a school friend,

22:07.140 --> 22:08.573
I'm sorry.

22:21.140 --> 22:23.335
- No.
- Didn't say anything.

22:23.420 --> 22:25.251
You didn't need to.

22:25.340 --> 22:29.174
- We're not having sex.
- But we're gay.

22:29.260 --> 22:32.935
It's not a club. There aren't rules.

22:33.020 --> 22:34.055
I got you a bed.

22:34.140 --> 22:36.210

I don't know anything, Paddy!

23:19.980 --> 23:21.299

23:21.380 --> 23:22.699
I don't know anything.

23:24.900 --> 23:28.097
I tried. Nothing.

23:28.180 --> 23:29.898
Not a word.

best option is to grit your teeth

23:37.260 --> 23:39.649

you've seen, and that'd ruin everything.

25:19.660 --> 25:20.809
What you talking about?

25:23.860 --> 25:25.691
Debbie... what have you done?

25:30.140 --> 25:31.459

I'm not! He hasn't won the lottery!

It's half a million quid, Debbie.

25:35.220 --> 25:36.892
It doesn't matter how much it was.

25:36.980 --> 25:39.938
It doesn't exist. He's just hurting
us all by pretending it does.

You mean you're pissed off
and want to teach him a lesson.

25:42.660 --> 25:44.616
Mum maxed out Norma's credit card.

Well, I'm gonna try. Just let
my head get bent out of shape.

Better put Dad out his misery.
Just hope he's learnt his lesson.

27:57.380 --> 28:00.338
Uh-oh. That is not good.

28:00.420 --> 28:02.411
Just act natural. You know nothing.

28:02.500 --> 28:04.331
Don't go!

28:04.420 --> 28:06.251
Might be for something else.

28:06.340 --> 28:08.900
It's not the first time
we've had police here.

28:11.660 --> 28:13.491
Please let it be domestic violence.

28:18.740 --> 28:22.096
We're going to do everything we can
to get him back. I promise you.

28:22.180 --> 28:23.135
DOOR CLOSES

28:23.220 --> 28:25.859
Sorry, Debbie, you can't be in here.

28:41.620 --> 28:45.135
I thank you so much for coming in
at such short notice.

28:45.220 --> 28:48.656
- No worries, love.
- I've turned the water off like you told me to.

28:50.980 --> 28:52.459
God, I've missed that arse.

29:01.780 --> 29:02.735
What you doing?

29:04.380 --> 29:05.938
Sorting through your coupons.

29:06.020 --> 29:09.171
Kind of therapeutic.

29:09.260 --> 29:10.739
You don't need to do that.

29:10.820 --> 29:13.857
Well, if it wasn't for you,
we'd have no food in the fridge,

29:13.940 --> 29:18.491
would we? Like a little Mussolini,
making all the trains run on time.

29:18.580 --> 29:19.774
Thanks.

29:21.380 --> 29:24.577
- It'll be all right.
- Fucking, no, it...

29:24.660 --> 29:26.537
It won't, Debs. Not this time.

29:31.140 --> 29:33.608
It's all my fault.

29:33.700 --> 29:38.376
"Whomever God wishes to destroy,
he first makes proud."

29:38.460 --> 29:41.770
I drew them all in
with me fool's gold and then...

29:41.860 --> 29:43.930
you know, they took away...

29:47.500 --> 29:50.298
...one of me real treasures.

29:53.220 --> 29:54.369
Liam's next door.

29:54.460 --> 29:56.690
What?

29:56.780 --> 30:01.012
He's fine. Five fingers, each hand.
Ten fingers in all.

30:01.100 --> 30:04.012
Unless you're one of them people
who don't count thumbs.

30:04.100 --> 30:06.489
What are you talking about?

30:06.580 --> 30:09.299
It was me. I kidnapped him.

30:15.620 --> 30:17.656
You'd kidnap your own brother?

30:17.740 --> 30:19.856
Only cos I wanted you
to tell the truth.

30:20.900 --> 30:23.539
Have you any idea
what you've put me through?!

30:23.620 --> 30:25.133
Your fucking mother through?

30:25.220 --> 30:28.371
No, Debbie. No, no.
You've gone too far this time.

30:28.460 --> 30:29.654
I was only trying to help.

30:29.740 --> 30:33.289
You're just interfering, telling me
what to do, as per fucking usual.

30:33.380 --> 30:34.779
So what you gonna do?

30:34.860 --> 30:36.009
What?

30:36.100 --> 30:37.579
About it all, all these people, the police.

30:37.660 --> 30:40.015
That's not my fucking fault.

30:40.100 --> 30:44.332
Oh, no, no. It never is your fault,
is it? You just stumble from moment

30:44.420 --> 30:47.412
to moment, leaving the rest of us
to pick up your shit!

30:47.500 --> 30:49.855
Well, not any more.
You're on your own!

30:51.220 --> 30:52.733
GROANS

30:58.100 --> 31:00.375
GROANS

31:00.460 --> 31:03.770
Dad'll be able to sort this,
get us out of here.

31:03.860 --> 31:06.328
Probably knock my teeth out
at the same time, but...

31:06.420 --> 31:07.899
That doesn't help me, does it?

31:07.980 --> 31:11.655
I had a really cute guy
lined up last night.

31:13.660 --> 31:15.537
- You've met someone else?
- Yeah.

31:16.980 --> 31:18.379
You're in love with him.

31:18.460 --> 31:19.609
What? No!

31:22.980 --> 31:24.413
So...

31:27.940 --> 31:29.293
Any chance of a blow job?

31:29.380 --> 31:30.972
- Mickey!
- Oh, just for fun.

31:31.060 --> 31:33.051
There's nothing else to do.

31:33.140 --> 31:35.370
Be good practice for you too.

31:36.460 --> 31:37.688
Please.

31:37.780 --> 31:40.294
- Don't say please.
- Why? What's wrong with me?

31:40.380 --> 31:42.052
Nothing's wrong with you.

31:42.140 --> 31:45.735
Well, maybe you act a bit desperate.

31:45.820 --> 31:47.458
And you're a little needy.

31:47.540 --> 31:50.577
And you need to, y'know,
just go out there. Have a life.

31:50.660 --> 31:52.651
Cos me and you, we're just mates.

31:52.740 --> 31:55.459
Nothing more. Just mates.

32:00.660 --> 32:02.651
Just mates.

32:03.740 --> 32:04.729
OK.

32:08.780 --> 32:09.974
A wank, then?

32:10.060 --> 32:12.449
I'm just gonna ignore you
till your dad shows.

32:17.460 --> 32:19.576
DOOR OPENS

32:21.300 --> 32:22.289
Hello.

32:24.180 --> 32:26.933
Look, Debs.

32:29.780 --> 32:33.409
Cards on the old table. You know,
nothing up the sleeve and that.

32:33.500 --> 32:35.934
- I need your help.
- Course you do.

32:36.020 --> 32:38.534
But you're not getting it.

32:38.620 --> 32:40.929
Yeah. It's like...

32:42.020 --> 32:44.056
...you know,
the Wizard of Oz, right?

32:44.140 --> 32:49.214
I'm standing here, like the cowardly
lion, tin man, gay scarecrow.

32:49.300 --> 32:51.291
You're that man behind the curtains,

32:51.380 --> 32:54.178
you know, working all the controls.

32:55.260 --> 32:57.649
SIGHS

33:00.260 --> 33:01.693
Basically, I'm fucked, love.

33:01.780 --> 33:03.179
Your head's bleeding.

33:04.260 --> 33:06.376
Was a good shot,
weren't it, bull's-eye.

33:08.660 --> 33:09.615
Here...

33:14.300 --> 33:15.415
Thanks.

33:17.380 --> 33:20.053
So you need to find a way to get out

33:20.140 --> 33:22.290
of everyone thinking you've won half
a million without them lynching you.

33:22.380 --> 33:23.938
Yeah, that'd be nice.

33:24.020 --> 33:26.250
And get Liam back without the police
charging you for wasting time.

33:26.340 --> 33:27.773
Again, nice.

33:31.020 --> 33:32.658
Good luck with it, then.

33:46.660 --> 33:47.615
Giro.

33:47.700 --> 33:49.213
What?

33:49.300 --> 33:52.770
Every fortnight.
In the housekeeping tin. Your giro.

33:56.660 --> 33:59.333
You know how many strings
I had to pull to get you out of there?

33:59.420 --> 34:00.375
No.

34:00.460 --> 34:01.813
Five!

34:01.900 --> 34:03.253
Get in the car!

34:04.340 --> 34:05.932
What's the big hurry?

34:06.020 --> 34:07.612
Liam's got kidnapped.

34:07.700 --> 34:08.768
What!

34:08.860 --> 34:11.328
- No, no, it's OK. I was behind it all.
- Jesus!

34:11.420 --> 34:14.617
Yeah, anyway, Carl still didn't
believe me that Dad was full of it,

34:14.699 --> 34:16.496
so Chesney cut off his little finger.

34:16.580 --> 34:18.810
Why the fuck
would he cut off Carl's finger?

34:18.900 --> 34:21.130
No, dumbo, he chopped off
Liam's finger.

34:21.219 --> 34:22.289
Liam's?

34:22.380 --> 34:24.291
Didn't actually do it.

34:24.380 --> 34:27.895
Dad's called the police,
and they're taking it really seriously.

34:27.980 --> 34:30.255
They're gonna stop at nothing
to catch the kidnappers.

34:30.340 --> 34:32.295
- Kidnappers being you?
- Bingo.

34:34.420 --> 34:36.728
I don't have a clue what's going on.

34:36.820 --> 34:40.290
Well, you better get an idea fast,
otherwise we're F-U-C-K'd.

34:40.380 --> 34:43.018
All right, all right.
Give me a minute here.

34:43.100 --> 34:44.533
D'you want me to start
from the beginning?

34:44.620 --> 34:46.576
No. Please don't.

34:48.460 --> 34:49.973
Two nights.

34:50.060 --> 34:51.572
Two nights I turn my back.

34:51.659 --> 34:53.969
- Yeah, cheers for returning my calls.
- I was in jail.

34:54.060 --> 34:55.458
It's not a competition, lan.

34:57.260 --> 34:58.579
So what we gonna do?

34:58.660 --> 35:01.652
First thing you're gonna do
is take it easy and stay low.

35:01.740 --> 35:03.731
You're already too close to it.

35:03.820 --> 35:05.970
But yeah, I've got an idea.

35:06.060 --> 35:09.291
Not sure it's the best idea ever,
but it's the only one I've got.

35:09.380 --> 35:10.859
All right if I borrow this?

35:10.940 --> 35:13.249
You lot are fucking nuts,
you know that?

35:13.340 --> 35:15.615
You know what you're doing, yeah?

35:15.700 --> 35:17.531
Just stick to lan's plan, OK?

35:17.620 --> 35:19.770
And maybe we won't all end up in jail.

35:19.860 --> 35:21.578
Make sure you don't fuck it up,

35:21.660 --> 35:24.857
the police are gonna be
listening in this time.

35:24.940 --> 35:26.498
CHESNEY CLEARS THROAT

35:28.460 --> 35:31.657
PHONE RINGS

35:31.740 --> 35:32.729
It's them.

35:32.820 --> 35:34.697
PHONE RINGS

35:39.340 --> 35:41.376
< Go on, answer it.

35:41.460 --> 35:42.415
Hello?

35:42.500 --> 35:47.415
'Frank, listen carefully.
This is what we want you to do.'

35:50.340 --> 35:53.776
Do the button up. Say something.

35:53.860 --> 35:55.498
- Something.
- Loud and clear.

35:55.580 --> 35:58.458
Right. The moment
you get your son, we're in.

35:58.540 --> 36:00.974
We'll take them down,
make sure you get your money.

36:01.060 --> 36:05.258
No. I don't care about the money.
You don't do anything.

36:05.340 --> 36:07.649
The only thing that matters
is that we get Liam back.

36:07.740 --> 36:10.857
You going to let these scumbags
walk away with half a million?

36:10.940 --> 36:12.612
You don't have children, do you?

36:12.700 --> 36:15.134
The money doesn't matter!

36:26.660 --> 36:27.775
Er... ladies?

36:27.860 --> 36:30.579
Oh, sorry, love. Official business.

36:30.660 --> 36:32.332
Plumber.

36:42.180 --> 36:44.978
Have to have a word with lan
about missing his shifts.

36:45.060 --> 36:46.288
What's with the plumber?

36:46.380 --> 36:47.893
What?

36:47.980 --> 36:51.973
Oh, yeah.
He's... He's a mate of mine.

36:52.060 --> 36:54.449
We go way back.
He said he'd take a look.

36:54.540 --> 36:55.893
I had somebody taking a look.

36:55.980 --> 36:57.652
Yeah, well, I decided to let him go.

36:57.740 --> 37:00.812
I just wanted to use someone I knew.

37:00.900 --> 37:02.811
I thought you said you were over this,

37:02.900 --> 37:05.778
and unless you've invented
a time machine or something,

37:05.860 --> 37:07.088
I can't change things, can I?

37:07.180 --> 37:09.216
You know how many people
I've been with?

37:09.300 --> 37:11.689
You can count on them one hand.

37:11.780 --> 37:14.772
Half a hand. Finger and thumb.

37:14.860 --> 37:16.532
So the only way you'll feel equal,

37:16.620 --> 37:19.657
feel comfortable, is if you sleep
with the same amount of people?

37:19.740 --> 37:20.695
Well, go on, then.

37:20.780 --> 37:25.331
Go to Lillian's, take the cash card
and don't stop until we're quits.

37:25.420 --> 37:28.537
What, you're telling me to go
and sleep with a bunch of prozzies?

37:28.620 --> 37:32.090
I am telling you that I love you.

37:32.180 --> 37:35.616
And I will do whatever it takes
to make this work.

37:35.700 --> 37:41.969
So whatever it takes for you
to feel normal, just fucking do it.

37:42.060 --> 37:45.177
Now's probably a bad time, right?

37:45.260 --> 37:47.376
- Yeah.
- Right.

37:54.220 --> 37:57.053
- The moment he gets the boy, we move in.
- But Mrs Gallagher said...

37:57.140 --> 38:00.257
I know what she said,
but this is our collar.

38:00.340 --> 38:03.776
No-one leaves that warehouse
without us locking it down.

38:03.860 --> 38:08.172
Approaching the, uh, perimeter... now.

38:28.340 --> 38:29.898
RADIO CRACKLE

38:37.500 --> 38:38.728
Liam! Liam!

38:43.740 --> 38:45.970
What do you want?
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

38:46.060 --> 38:48.654
It's gone tits up! Go! Go! Go!

38:51.620 --> 38:53.497
You slept with my wife!

38:53.580 --> 38:56.697
- Who the fuck's your wife?
- Karen, you ignorant bastard!

38:56.780 --> 39:01.774
Oh, fucking... That's just
ancient history, it's old news.

39:01.860 --> 39:04.613
I don't care if it was years ago.
You're a dirty fucker.

39:04.700 --> 39:07.976
I might not be able to get every one
of them, but I can start with you!

39:08.060 --> 39:10.893
- And what are you gonna do for an encore?
- You what?

39:10.980 --> 39:13.255
After you've gone all
Captain Caveman on me,

39:13.340 --> 39:16.571
you going to run round the estate,
beating all the others up, eh?

39:16.660 --> 39:19.015
Christ, you'll be busy
for six months. Brilliant!

39:19.100 --> 39:22.649
Meanwhile, lickle wifey's home alone,
wondering why she married such a catch.

39:22.740 --> 39:26.653
Look, you should just finish it, pal,
if you hate her that much.

39:26.740 --> 39:28.173
I don't hate her.

39:30.060 --> 39:31.015
I love her.

39:31.100 --> 39:33.614
Oh, well, I've got tears in me eyes.

39:33.700 --> 39:35.292
You feel better after that, then?

39:35.380 --> 39:37.689
No. No, I don't.

39:37.780 --> 39:39.008
I think I've got issues.

39:39.100 --> 39:40.772
Welcome to the party.

39:41.940 --> 39:43.532
Aaaaaah! Gotcha!

39:43.620 --> 39:45.770
No, fucking... Just get off,
just let him go, let him go!

39:45.860 --> 39:47.578
What?

39:48.780 --> 39:52.455
He's the big hero round here.
He... He saved me life.

39:54.900 --> 39:56.458
It's empty!

39:56.540 --> 39:58.849
The bad guys went thataway.

39:58.940 --> 40:01.454
Come on!

40:05.740 --> 40:07.571
They got away!

40:07.660 --> 40:10.094
Right, Stan, you go that way.
Tom, you're with me.

40:20.660 --> 40:22.218
I'm really sorry.

40:33.620 --> 40:35.815
It's just...

40:35.900 --> 40:37.891
all those things
I don't know about you...

40:37.980 --> 40:40.175
Nearly drove me crazy.

40:42.260 --> 40:43.852
Here.

40:47.860 --> 40:51.648
That's a list of everybody
I've slept with. So you know everything.

40:51.740 --> 40:55.733
I'm not ashamed of me past,
and I'm not disgusted by it either.

40:57.540 --> 40:58.814
I am glad it led to you.

41:00.740 --> 41:03.459
That's total honesty.

41:11.220 --> 41:12.539
Come here.

41:18.700 --> 41:23.091
Hey, that plumber you hired
tried to hit on me.

41:23.180 --> 41:25.455
Had to kick his arse out the door.

41:25.540 --> 41:27.929
Oh, well, well. Prodigal returns.

41:28.020 --> 41:30.978
- You've missed three shifts.
- And almost fucked up our marriage.

41:31.060 --> 41:33.893
I'm sorry.
What I said earlier, I overreacted.

41:33.980 --> 41:35.618
All right, mate. We'll be fine.

41:35.700 --> 41:39.170
- Just got to get used to living with a slut.
- She has changed a lot.

41:39.260 --> 41:41.137
I meant you, gayboy.

41:41.220 --> 41:45.896
(Frank) Hey, Calvin Klein!
There's folk dying of thirst out here.

41:51.980 --> 41:54.494
Oh!

41:54.820 --> 41:57.937
I need to clear my credit card, Frank.
Where's the money?

41:59.340 --> 42:01.490
Money? Right.

42:01.580 --> 42:03.252
Dad.

42:03.340 --> 42:05.092
Tell them the truth.

42:07.500 --> 42:09.695
Will you all just shut up?

42:21.820 --> 42:24.254
That'll bring you luck, that, love.

42:27.100 --> 42:30.456
- Really?
- Yeah.

42:32.820 --> 42:36.369
I stand before you today
not as a man,

42:36.460 --> 42:40.453
but as a father
of a very special girl, who...

42:40.540 --> 42:43.532
The point is that...

42:46.020 --> 42:47.738
...I didn't win the lottery.

42:47.820 --> 42:50.857
GASPS OF DISAPPOINTMENT

42:50.940 --> 42:53.693
(Man) Typical fucking Gallagher, in't it?

42:53.780 --> 42:55.054
There's no cash.

42:58.220 --> 43:01.530
Not that truth, the other truth!

43:01.620 --> 43:04.851
The kidnapping one!
Half a million ransom.

43:04.940 --> 43:06.419
Right.

43:07.500 --> 43:08.569
Idiot!

43:16.100 --> 43:21.538
New tin. Got a key and a lock and all.
Can't trust anyone round here.

43:29.860 --> 43:31.976
Don't worry, you'll still get
your pocket money.

43:32.060 --> 43:34.858
Oh, Debs.

43:34.940 --> 43:37.852
I come from nothing,
and I'll end up with nothing.

43:37.940 --> 43:41.979
You know, what's in between doesn't
matter. Have a penny, lose a penny.

43:42.060 --> 43:44.779
Hakuna matata. That's me.

43:47.500 --> 43:49.650
Dad...

43:49.740 --> 43:51.537
Spare key, please.

43:57.060 --> 43:59.176
Thank you.

44:10.700 --> 44:13.498
(Liam) 'Debbie says money
really can't buy you happiness.

44:17.100 --> 44:20.058
'Doesn't mean I wouldn't like
to try it every once in a while.

44:21.660 --> 44:24.697
'It can, however,
buy you a cappuccino machine,

44:24.780 --> 44:27.897
'a widescreen telly,
a trip to Disneyland,

44:27.980 --> 44:32.019
'those wrestling action figures
which are kind of gay, but I want them,

44:32.100 --> 44:36.093
'and a pair of trainers that light up
when you walk would be cool.

44:36.180 --> 44:39.058
'Maybe even some roller blades.

44:39.140 --> 44:41.335
'Oh, fireworks, that'd be mint.'

45:27.420 --> 45:29.092
CLOCK TICKS
