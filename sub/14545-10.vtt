WEBVTT

00:01.202 --> 00:03.671
YOU READY, TESS?

00:03.737 --> 00:06.140
I WAS BORN READY.

00:06.207 --> 00:07.741
THE NEXT FEW MINUTES
WOULD DETERMINE

00:07.808 --> 00:09.110
WHETHER I WOULD RUN FREE,

00:09.177 --> 00:11.945
LIKE A WILD COYOTE
WITH THE WIND IN MY FUR,

00:12.012 --> 00:13.847
OR STAY TIED TO THE FENCE
LIKE A RABID--

00:13.914 --> 00:15.349
TESSA.

00:15.416 --> 00:17.985
WE HAVE
A SCHEDULED APPOINTMENT.

00:18.052 --> 00:19.853
SORRY.

00:19.920 --> 00:22.156
MY LAST FEW MOMENTS
AS A PEDESTRIAN.

00:22.223 --> 00:23.391
COCKY. DON'T GET COCKY.

00:23.457 --> 00:24.558
(telephone ringing in distance)

00:24.625 --> 00:27.761
OKAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
GOOD NUMBER.

00:27.828 --> 00:29.163
(chuckles)

00:29.230 --> 00:31.465
(gasps) OH, MY GOSH!

00:31.532 --> 00:33.401
HEY!
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING HERE?

00:33.467 --> 00:34.602
ANTIQUING.

00:34.668 --> 00:36.036
WELL, DALIA'S GETTING
HER DRIVER'S LICENSE,

00:36.104 --> 00:38.372
OR SO WE HOPE.
THIRD TIME'S THE CHARM.

00:38.439 --> 00:40.108
YOU--OH, YOU--SHE, UH,
SHE FAILED TWICE ALREADY?

00:40.174 --> 00:43.377
NO, NO. GOD, NO.
I'M ROUNDING DOWN FROM SIX.

00:43.444 --> 00:47.281
THESE CHATSWIN
TEST ADMINISTRATORS ARE T-U-F-F.

00:47.348 --> 00:48.682
THEY DON'T LET YOU HIT
ANYTHING.

00:48.749 --> 00:50.684
(woman over P.A.)
TESSA ALTMAN, WINDOW 25.

00:50.751 --> 00:51.785
THAT'S ME.

00:51.852 --> 00:53.287
NO, THAT'S ME, ACTUALLY.

00:53.354 --> 00:55.189
OKAY, CHECK YOUR MIRRORS.
LET HIM SEE YOU

00:55.256 --> 00:56.424
CHECK YOUR MIRRORS.

00:56.490 --> 00:57.791
WHY ARE YOU ASSUMING
IT'S A HE?

00:57.858 --> 00:59.993
OKAY.
OKAY, FAIR ENOUGH, BUT...

01:00.060 --> 01:01.562
(lowered voice)
THAT STEREOTYPE EXISTS

01:01.629 --> 01:03.597
FOR A REASON,
SO YOU PROVE THEM WRONG.

01:03.664 --> 01:05.199
OW!

01:05.266 --> 01:07.601
(whispers)
PROVE THEM WRONG.

01:07.668 --> 01:10.804
(normal voice)
OKAY. HERE. UH, OH!

01:10.871 --> 01:13.040
WHOO! SORRY.

01:13.107 --> 01:15.843
WHOO. SORRY.

01:15.909 --> 01:18.146
OKAY. (sighs)

01:18.212 --> 01:20.080
IT WAS FUN TEACHING HER
TO DRIVE, YOU KNOW?

01:20.148 --> 01:21.549
OH, MY GOSH, YES.

01:21.615 --> 01:23.617
I'M QUITE SURE
CARMEN FEELS THE SAME WAY

01:23.684 --> 01:25.153
ABOUT TEACHING DALIA.

01:25.219 --> 01:27.288
ALTHOUGH CARMEN REALLY
SHOULDN'T BE DRIVING...

01:27.355 --> 01:29.323
(whispers)
FOR SO MANY REASONS.

01:29.390 --> 01:32.226
DALIA ROYCE, WINDOW 8.

01:37.898 --> 01:40.134
I THINK THAT'S ME.

01:40.201 --> 01:42.236
YEAH. YEP, IT IS.

01:42.303 --> 01:43.837
ALL RIGHT.
GO GET 'EM, DARLIN'!

01:43.904 --> 01:44.838
YES!

01:44.905 --> 01:47.408
DRIVE OR DIE TRYING!

01:47.475 --> 01:49.810
MAYBE THAT'S BAD ADVICE.

01:51.879 --> 01:56.184
AFTER ACING MY ROAD TEST,
I DECIDED TO FAKE GEORGE OUT,

01:56.250 --> 01:58.018
LIKE THOSE "IDOL" CONTESTANTS

01:58.085 --> 01:59.987
WHO HIDE THE YELLOW PIECE
OF PAPER BEHIND THEIR BACKS,

02:00.053 --> 02:03.291
EVEN THOUGH WE TOTALLY KNOW
THEY'RE GOING TO HOLLYWOOD.

02:03.357 --> 02:05.493
YOU'RE GOING TO HOLLYWOOD!

02:05.559 --> 02:06.294
WHOO!

02:06.360 --> 02:07.995
(laughs) OH, YES!

02:08.061 --> 02:09.163
HE SAID I WAS PERFECT...

02:09.230 --> 02:10.731
MM!
MY PARALLEL PARKING...

02:10.798 --> 02:11.765
MM!

02:11.832 --> 02:13.201
MY 3-POINT TURN,

02:13.267 --> 02:15.769
AND MY CHOICE
IN RADIO STATION.

02:15.836 --> 02:16.904
UNH!

02:16.970 --> 02:18.306
COLLEGE INDIE?

02:18.372 --> 02:20.040
SMOOTH JAZZ. HE WAS OLD,

02:20.107 --> 02:21.642
SO I PLAYED TO THE CROWD.
(chuckles)

02:21.709 --> 02:22.443
VERY SMART.

02:22.510 --> 02:24.478
MM! HOW'D DALIA DO?

02:24.545 --> 02:26.980
OH.
(man) YOU'RE GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.
TRY TO KEEP YOUR HEAD...

02:27.047 --> 02:27.848
AS EXPECTED.

02:27.915 --> 02:29.283
I'M TELLING YOU,
SHE DIDN'T USE THE MIRRORS.

02:29.350 --> 02:32.019
NOT EVEN A BLINKER.
I'M OKAY.

02:32.085 --> 02:33.787

* DA-DA-DA-DA,

02:42.129 --> 02:44.131
NO HIGHWAYS,

AND YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED
TO GO OVER 50.

02:45.733 --> 02:48.236
AND YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO ACT
OVER 50. GIVE ME THE KEYS.

02:48.302 --> 02:50.771
I'LL CALL YOU WHEN I WANT
TO BE PICKED UP, OKAY?

02:50.838 --> 02:52.406
ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT ME
TO LEAVE YOU HERE?

02:52.473 --> 02:54.408
YOU'VE BEEN HERE FOR, LIKE,
FIVE DAYS IN A ROW.

02:54.475 --> 02:57.411
I CAN TAKE YOU TO A LIBRARY
OR SOMETHING.

02:57.478 --> 02:59.413
THEY HAVE A LIBRARY.
(chuckles)

02:59.480 --> 03:01.382
I FIGURED SINCE NOAH
GAVE ME HIS GUEST PASS,

03:01.449 --> 03:02.983
I MIGHT AS WELL TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF IT.

03:03.050 --> 03:07.355
OH, GEORGE WAS DEFINITELY
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF IT.

03:24.472 --> 03:26.674
(man) HEY, GEORGE.

03:30.544 --> 03:33.347
WHEW! NOTHING--
NOTHING TAKES IT OFF YOU

03:33.414 --> 03:36.717
LIKE A GOOD STEAM,
RIGHT, MARTY?

03:38.185 --> 03:39.720
MARTY?

03:39.787 --> 03:40.721
I'M ALIVE.

03:40.788 --> 03:41.922
OH.

03:43.857 --> 03:45.593
MR. ALTMAN? I'M SORRY.

03:45.659 --> 03:47.328
THIS IS A LITTLE AWKWARD.
(chuckles)

03:47.395 --> 03:48.862
OH, IT'S FINE.
I'M WEARING UNDERWEAR.

03:48.929 --> 03:52.099
I'M SORRY TO INFORM YOU,
YOUR GUEST PASS HAS EXPIRED.

03:52.165 --> 03:53.634
OH, WELL, OKAY.
THAT'S NO PROBLEM.

03:53.701 --> 03:55.469
CAN I JUST HAVE NOAH
RENEW IT?

03:55.536 --> 03:58.372
"CAN I JUST HAVE NOAH
RENEW IT?"

03:58.439 --> 04:00.608
UH, NO, YOU CANNOT.
GUEST PASSES ARE NONRENEWABLE,

04:00.674 --> 04:02.410
SO I'M AFRAID
THIS IS GOOD-BYE.

04:02.476 --> 04:04.545
CAN I JUST FINISH MY STEAM?

04:04.612 --> 04:05.846
I COULDN'T JUST FINISH
MY STEAM?

04:05.913 --> 04:07.080
BRUTAL, BUDDY.

04:07.147 --> 04:08.516
MIND TAKING A STEP BACK?

04:08.582 --> 04:09.850
YOU'RE DRIPPING ALL OVER
MY GORDITAS. (chuckles)

04:09.917 --> 04:11.485
SO ISN'T THERE SOMETHING
YOU CAN DO?

04:11.552 --> 04:13.987
WELL, THE GUEST MEMBERSHIP THING
WAS ALWAYS TEMPORARY.

04:14.054 --> 04:15.523
IT HAD TO END SOMETIME,

04:15.589 --> 04:17.257
AND FRANKLY, I'M SURPRISED
THEY LET IT GO ON THIS LONG.

04:17.325 --> 04:18.692
HEY, WHY DON'T YOU JOIN
THE CLUB, GEORGE?

04:18.759 --> 04:21.194
FRED, WHY DON'T YOU HAVE
ANOTHER ARNOLD PALMER

04:21.261 --> 04:22.563
AND ENJOY
YOUR OWN BUSINESS?

04:22.630 --> 04:23.931
OH, DON'T MIND IF I DO.

04:23.997 --> 04:25.366
MAYBE I SHOULD JUST JOIN.

04:25.433 --> 04:26.767
H-HALF THE BUSINESS I'VE DONE
SINCE I MOVED HERE

04:26.834 --> 04:28.802
CAME FROM CONTACTS
I MADE IN THIS PLACE.

04:28.869 --> 04:30.203
MEMBERSHIP PRACTICALLY PAYS
FOR ITSELF.

04:30.270 --> 04:32.506
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT THAT, FRED.

04:32.573 --> 04:35.343
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK, NOAH?
WILL YOU SPONSOR ME?

04:35.409 --> 04:37.177
OH. (chuckling) WILL I?

04:37.244 --> 04:38.278
YES, WILL YOU?

04:38.346 --> 04:40.848
NOW DON'T BE CRAZY.
(laughing)

04:40.914 --> 04:42.115
SO THAT'S A "YES"?

04:42.182 --> 04:44.084
IS IT? I DON'T...

04:44.151 --> 04:45.553
(Noah and Fred laugh)

04:45.619 --> 04:47.788
GEORGE, IT GOES AGAINST ALL
OF MY BEST INSTINCTS

04:47.855 --> 04:50.691
TO TELL YOU THIS,
BUT MANAGEMENT SAYS

04:50.758 --> 04:53.327
YOU CAN'T BE IN HERE
WITHOUT CLOTHES ON.

04:53.394 --> 04:55.262
ALL RIGHT. I'M--I'M GOING.

04:55.329 --> 04:59.733
YEAH, NOT WITH THAT ROBE,
YOU'RE NOT. SORRY. CLUB RULES.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.469
(chuckles)

05:01.535 --> 05:03.070
SUDDENLY, I WAS AT THE TOP
OF THE FOOD CHAIN.

05:03.136 --> 05:04.505
I WAS A DRIVER.

05:04.572 --> 05:06.940
HEARD YOU PASSED
YOUR DRIVER'S TEST.

05:08.008 --> 05:09.242
HEARD YOU DIDN'T.

05:09.309 --> 05:12.446
DID YOU GET WHIPLASH WATCHING ME
SURPASS YOU IN EVERY WAY?

05:12.513 --> 05:16.316
YEAH, AND ALSO WHEN I RAN
INTO THE DOG GROOMING TRUCK.

05:16.384 --> 05:18.185
(Kenzie and Kaitlyn)
ASK HER ABOUT THE RIDE

05:18.251 --> 05:19.553
BEFORE THE LATE BELL RINGS.

05:19.620 --> 05:20.888
ARE YOU GUYS IDENTICAL?

05:20.954 --> 05:24.692
ALMOST. HER EYES ARE MORE CAT,
AND MINE ARE MORE ALMOND.

05:24.758 --> 05:29.029
SHE HATES ONIONS AND OLIVES,
AND I ONLY HATE ONIONS...

05:29.096 --> 05:30.464
AND OLIVES.

05:30.531 --> 05:31.865
THAT MAKES SENSE.

05:31.932 --> 05:34.735
TESSA, I'D LIKE TO COMMISSION
YOUR SERVICES.

05:34.802 --> 05:36.637
I DON'T OFFER ANY SERVICES.

05:36.704 --> 05:37.505
YOU DRIVE.

05:37.571 --> 05:40.374
YEAH,
BUT I DON'T DRIVE YOU.

05:40.441 --> 05:41.842
SHE'LL PAY YOU 20 BUCKS.

05:41.909 --> 05:43.411
(scoffs) 20 BUCKS.

05:43.477 --> 05:45.746
FINE. I'LL DOUBLE IT.

05:46.880 --> 05:47.948
50 BUCKS.

05:48.015 --> 05:49.216
CHECK YOUR MATH.

05:49.282 --> 05:54.988
CHECK YOUR ATTITUDE, HOOKER.
WILL YOU DRIVE ME OR NOT?

05:55.055 --> 05:57.858
70 BUCKS, OKAY? (sighs)
IT'S IMPORTANT.

05:57.925 --> 05:59.827
I'D NEVER SEEN DALIA
SO DESPERATE.

05:59.893 --> 06:03.230
MAYBE SHE NEEDED A RIDE
TO REHAB OR TO THE OB-GYN.

06:03.296 --> 06:06.233
EITHER WAY, SHE WAS CLEARLY
REACHING OUT FOR HELP,

06:06.299 --> 06:08.235
SO I DID THE ONLY THING
I COULD DO.

06:08.301 --> 06:10.704
MAKE IT $100,
AND YOU BUY GAS.

06:15.142 --> 06:17.511
CAN YOU BREAK $1,000?

06:18.679 --> 06:20.714
IS THAT GROVER CLEVELAND?

06:20.781 --> 06:23.116
(bell rings)

06:27.655 --> 06:29.690
NOT IN A SCHOOL ZONE.
WHAT IF HE LEAVES?

06:29.757 --> 06:31.792
I'M SURE HE WON'T LEAVE.
WHAT TIME IS YOUR APPOINTMENT?

06:31.859 --> 06:33.360
I DON'T HAVE
AN APPOINTMENT.

06:33.427 --> 06:35.362
WE'RE GOING TO SEE
SCOTT STRAUSS.

06:35.429 --> 06:37.130
WHO'S SCOTT STRAUSS?
OH, MY GOD.

06:37.197 --> 06:39.166
THAT'S THE DUMBEST QUESTION
I'VE EVER HEARD.

06:39.232 --> 06:40.333
"WHO'S SCOTT STRAUSS?"

06:40.400 --> 06:42.002
SCOTT STRAUSS GRADUATED
LAST YEAR,

06:42.069 --> 06:43.904
AND HE'S, LIKE, THE HOTTEST GUY
TO WALK THE FACE OF THE EARTH,

06:43.971 --> 06:47.140
INCLUDING JESUS, OUR POOL GUY,
WHO'S ALSO SUPERHOT.

06:47.207 --> 06:48.442
PASS THIS MAN. PASS HIM!

06:48.509 --> 06:50.143
IT'S A SOLID YELLOW LINE.

06:50.210 --> 06:51.779
LIKE ANYONE KNOWS
WHAT THAT IS.

06:51.845 --> 06:53.714
YOU'RE NOT EVEN
A GOOD BACKSEAT DRIVER.

06:53.781 --> 06:55.516
OH, MY GOD.
MY MOM WOULD KILL ME

06:55.583 --> 06:57.317
IF SHE KNEW I WAS BACK
ON SCOTT STRAUSS.

06:57.384 --> 06:58.886
SHE PAID ME
A THOUSAND ANCIENT DOLLARS

06:58.952 --> 07:00.287
NOT TO JOCK HIM.

07:00.353 --> 07:01.822
AND YET YOU CONTINUE
TO JOCK.

07:01.889 --> 07:04.424
A LOT HAS HAPPENED
SINCE I MADE THAT PROMISE.

07:04.492 --> 07:05.659
SCOTT BROKE UP WITH BRIANNA,

07:05.726 --> 07:07.761
AND SHE WENT ON A TEEN TOUR
AND GOT CHLAMYDIA.

07:07.828 --> 07:11.064
OH, MY GOD! THAT'S IT.
THAT'S SCOTT'S HOUSE.

07:11.131 --> 07:12.199
DO YOU WANT ME TO STOP?

07:12.265 --> 07:13.467
NO, YOU LOSER. KEEP GOING.

07:13.534 --> 07:16.103
CIRCLE THE BLOCK.
CIRCLE THE BLOCK!

07:16.169 --> 07:19.473
(sighs) I HATE THIS JOB.

07:19.540 --> 07:21.208
(knock on door)
(jazz music playing)

07:21.274 --> 07:22.610
NOAH? HEY, MAN.

07:22.676 --> 07:25.178
GEORGE?
YOU SHOULDN'T BE IN HERE.

07:25.245 --> 07:26.413
OH.

07:26.480 --> 07:27.548
UH, UNLESS IT'S OKAY
WITH THE PATIENT.

07:27.615 --> 07:28.849
(mouth full, mumbles)

07:28.916 --> 07:30.984
SHE SAYS IT'S OKAY.
WHAT'S UP?

07:31.051 --> 07:32.686
(door closes)
SO... (sighs) WHAT'S GOING
ON WITH MY APPLICATION?

07:32.753 --> 07:34.688
I CALLED THE CLUB.
THEY HAVEN'T HEARD FROM YOU YET.

07:34.755 --> 07:37.190
THEY HAVEN'T? THAT'S CRAZY.

07:37.257 --> 07:38.191
SO YOU CALLED?

07:38.258 --> 07:39.326
NO.
SO WHAT'S THE DEAL?

07:39.392 --> 07:40.794
DO YOU NOT WANT ME TO JOIN
THE CLUB?

07:40.861 --> 07:42.763
BECAUSE I'M--I'M GETTING
A WEIRD VIBE FROM YOU.

07:42.830 --> 07:44.998
VIBE? WHAT VIBE?
THERE IS NO VIBE.

07:45.065 --> 07:47.300
REALLY? BECAUSE LAST WEEK
IN THE LOCKER ROOM,

07:47.367 --> 07:50.203
I BORROWED YOUR SHAMPOO,
AND YOU SHOT ME THIS DIRTY LOOK.

07:50.270 --> 07:53.507
WHAT? GET OUTTA HERE.
THERE IS NO DIRTY LOOK.

07:53.574 --> 07:56.710
THIS FACE CAN'T MAKE
A DIRTY LOOK. SEE?

07:56.777 --> 07:58.045
THAT'S AS DIRTY AS IT GETS.

07:58.111 --> 08:00.313
(chuckles) SO YOU'RE OKAY
WITH ME JOINING?

08:00.380 --> 08:02.215
OF COURSE,
ALTHOUGH YOU SHOULD KNOW,

08:02.282 --> 08:04.251
THEY'RE GONNA MAKE YOU JUMP
THROUGH SOME HOOPS.

08:04.317 --> 08:05.786
OKAY. HOW MANY HOOPS?

08:05.853 --> 08:09.489
MM. THERE'S THE APPLICATION, UH,
THE NEW MEMBER INTERVIEW.

08:09.557 --> 08:11.525
THEY'RE GONNA MAKE YOU WEAR
A SUIT FOR THAT.

08:11.592 --> 08:12.526
SO TWO HOOPS.

08:12.593 --> 08:13.794
(mumbles)

08:13.861 --> 08:17.497
OH, SHE'S RIGHT.
THERE'S ALSO AN ESSAY.

08:17.565 --> 08:19.232
WHY ARE WE DOING
THIS AGAIN, DALIA?

08:19.299 --> 08:20.768
WE'RE RUNNING...

08:20.834 --> 08:23.270
ACTUALLY WE'RE FINE ON GAS.
IT'S A PRIUS.

08:23.336 --> 08:24.938
EVERY DAY, WE'RE CIRCLING.

08:25.005 --> 08:28.308
WE'RE CIRCLING AND CIRCLING
AND CIRCLING UNTIL WE SEE HIM,

08:28.375 --> 08:29.409
OR YOU'RE FIRED.

08:29.476 --> 08:30.944
FINE. I'M FIRED.

08:31.011 --> 08:32.713
THIS ISN'T HOW I WANT
TO SPEND MY LIFE ANYWAY.

08:32.780 --> 08:36.516
I'M TIRED AND DIZZY,
AND... I HAVE DRIVER'S ITCH.

08:36.584 --> 08:37.585
(gasps) LOOK OUT!

08:37.651 --> 08:39.119
(tires screech, crash, creaks)

08:39.186 --> 08:41.154
OH, MY GOD.
(dog barking in distance)

08:41.221 --> 08:42.322
I HIT SOMEBODY.

08:42.389 --> 08:43.791
I'M A RECKLESS DRIVER.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.525
I AM
A BRAND-NEW, RECKLESS DRIVER!

08:45.593 --> 08:49.897
TESSA, YOU JUST BANGED
SCOTT STRAUSS.

08:49.963 --> 08:51.064
**

08:51.131 --> 08:54.201
* DA-DA, DA-DA-DA-DA-DA-DA,
DA-DA-DA-DA-DA *

08:54.267 --> 08:55.669
* HEY, YOU
* HEY, YOU

08:55.736 --> 08:57.905
* I REALLY WANNA KNOW YA

08:57.971 --> 09:00.641
* DA-DA, DA-DA-DA-DA-DA-DA,
DA-DA-DA-DA-DA *

09:00.708 --> 09:02.576
* YEAH, YOU
* YEAH, YOU

09:02.643 --> 09:04.745
* I REALLY WANNA KNOW YA

09:08.582 --> 09:10.317
(pants) OKAY. STAY CALM.

09:10.383 --> 09:14.487
PULL OVER TO A SAFE AREA.
EXCHANGE INSURANCE INFORMATION.

09:14.554 --> 09:16.556
DO NOT ASSUME
RESPONSIBILITY.

09:16.624 --> 09:17.958
AND ASK HIM OUT FOR ME.

09:18.025 --> 09:19.927
DALIA, I HAVE
OTHER PROBLEMS RIGHT NOW.

09:19.993 --> 09:23.196
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
A LONG, BLONDE PROBLEM

09:23.263 --> 09:25.866
IF YOU DON'T ASK OUT
SCOTT STRAUSS.

09:27.200 --> 09:27.935
50 MORE BUCKS.

09:28.001 --> 09:31.772
* I REALLY WANNA KNOW YA

09:31.839 --> 09:33.707
(car door closes)

09:33.774 --> 09:35.208
HEY, ARE YOU OKAY?
BEFORE YOU SAY ANYTHING,

09:35.275 --> 09:36.376
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW
I'M NOT ASSUMING

09:36.443 --> 09:38.245
ANY RESPONSIBILITY.

09:38.311 --> 09:40.648
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
THERE'S NO DAMAGE.

09:40.714 --> 09:42.783
ALTHOUGH... MAYBE WE SHOULD
EXCHANGE INFORMATION,

09:42.850 --> 09:44.584
JUST TO BE SAFE.
I HAVE YOUR INFORMATION.

09:44.652 --> 09:47.154
YOU'RE SCOTT STRAUSS.
YOU DRIVE AN A6.

09:47.220 --> 09:49.222
YOU USED TO GO OUT WITH
THIS DUMB GIRL NAMED BRIANNA,

09:49.289 --> 09:50.824
WHO WENT ON THIS TEEN TOUR
AND GOT SOME--

09:50.891 --> 09:53.727
OKAY, OKAY. YOU ALREADY
HAVE MY INFORMATION,

09:53.794 --> 09:56.096
SO... MAYBE YOU SHOULD
GIVE ME YOURS.

09:56.163 --> 09:59.867
I'M TESSA. I RECENTLY MOVED
HERE FROM NEW YORK.

09:59.933 --> 10:03.470
I LIKE PAD THAI
AND REAR-ENDING PEOPLE.

10:03.536 --> 10:05.005
(horn honks)

10:05.072 --> 10:08.909
SORRY. GREAT GAS MILEAGE,
BUT... SPORADIC HONKING.

10:08.976 --> 10:11.044
SO... AREN'T YOU CURIOUS

10:11.111 --> 10:12.746
HOW I KNOW ALL THAT STUFF
ABOUT YOU?

10:12.813 --> 10:14.614
I JUST FIGURED YOU WERE
FACEBOOK STALKING ME.

10:14.682 --> 10:17.685
ME? STALK YOU?

10:17.751 --> 10:20.320
NO. (chuckles) NO, NO, NO.

10:20.387 --> 10:23.223
DALIA ROYCE IS STALKING YOU--
YOUR NEXT GIRLFRIEND.

10:23.290 --> 10:25.425
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
DALIA'S MY NEXT GIRLFRIEND?

10:25.492 --> 10:29.162
JUDGING FROM WHAT I KNOW
ABOUT BRIANNA, SHE'S YOUR TYPE.

10:29.229 --> 10:30.563
MAYBE I HAVE A NEW TYPE.

10:30.630 --> 10:32.800
YOU DON'T.

10:32.866 --> 10:34.601
SO SHOULD WE PICK YOU UP
AROUND 8:00?

10:34.668 --> 10:35.602
"WE"?

10:35.669 --> 10:37.838
I'M DALIA'S DRIVER.

10:42.009 --> 10:43.276
WHEW.

10:43.343 --> 10:46.379
I'M NOT DOING UNDERWEAR.
THAT'S FINE, RIGHT?

10:47.447 --> 10:48.515
(sighs)

10:48.581 --> 10:49.950
CLOSE THE DOOR.

10:50.017 --> 10:51.819
MARTY, I WAS IN THE PROCESS
OF CLOSING IT

10:51.885 --> 10:53.320
AS YOU'RE TELLING ME
TO CLOSE IT.

10:53.386 --> 10:54.988
(door closes)
IF YOU HAD WAITED
EVEN A HALF A SECOND,

10:55.055 --> 10:56.757
THE DOOR WOULD HAVE ALREADY
BEEN CLOSED.

10:56.824 --> 10:59.592
SEE? THERE. LOOK.
IT'S CLOSED, MARTY.

10:59.659 --> 11:01.061
EVERYTHING OKAY, GEORGE?

11:01.128 --> 11:03.864
NOT REALLY, DUDE.
I'M JUMPING THROUGH HOOPS.

11:03.931 --> 11:06.033
I BOUGHT THE SUIT.
I WROTE THE ESSAY.

11:06.099 --> 11:07.701
(sighs)
THEN THE OFFICE TELLS ME
YOU HAVEN'T EVEN BOTHERED

11:07.768 --> 11:09.770
TO FILL OUT THE SPONSOR SECTION.

11:09.837 --> 11:12.339
I WALK IN HERE.
I FIND YOU WITH MARTY.

11:12.405 --> 11:13.673
WHAT'S THE DEAL?

11:13.741 --> 11:16.343
HEY, IS THIS A, UH,
PRIVATES PARTY? (chuckles)

11:16.409 --> 11:20.213
(laughs) LOOK, GEORGE,
UH, WHY DON'T YOU GO

11:20.280 --> 11:22.315
TAKE A COLD PLUNGE
AND CALM DOWN? (chuckles)

11:22.382 --> 11:24.617
WELL, BECAUSE I'M NOT ALLOWED
IN THE COLD PLUNGE, NOAH,

11:24.684 --> 11:25.886
AND I THINK YOU KNOW THAT.

11:25.953 --> 11:27.054
WELL, YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED
IN HERE, EITHER,

11:27.120 --> 11:28.621
BUT THAT DIDN'T SEEM
TO STOP YOU.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.123
IF YOU DIDN'T WANT
TO SPONSOR ME,

11:30.190 --> 11:31.624
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST SAY SO?
I WOULD HAVE ASKED FRED.

11:31.691 --> 11:34.461
FRED, W-WOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPY
TO SPONSOR ME. RIGHT, FRED?

11:34.527 --> 11:37.097
WELL, I'D HAVE TO ASK SHEILA,
BUT I SUPPOSE SO.

11:37.164 --> 11:40.834
AND IF YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT
YOUR PRECIOUS SHAMPOO, DON'T BE.

11:40.901 --> 11:42.269
I WON'T BORROW IT AGAIN.

11:42.335 --> 11:45.038
TO BE 100% HONEST,
IT ROBBED MY HAIR OF BODY

11:45.105 --> 11:46.874
AND STRIPPED IT OF SHINE.

11:46.940 --> 11:48.341
IT'S NOT ABOUT
THE SHAMPOO, GEORGE.

11:48.408 --> 11:50.010
OH. (chuckles) OKAY.
MARTY, YOU HEARD THAT?

11:50.077 --> 11:51.678
YEAH. YEAH.
IT'S NOT ABOUT THE SHAMPOO,

11:51.745 --> 11:53.046
BUT IT IS ABOUT SOMETHING.

11:53.113 --> 11:54.347
HE ADMITTED IT.
HE DOESN'T WANT ME HERE.

11:54.414 --> 11:56.683
LOOK, THIS IS WHY.
YOU'RE LOOKING AT MARTY.

11:56.750 --> 11:59.152
I INTRODUCED YOU TO MARTY.
I OWN MARTY!

11:59.219 --> 11:59.953
THIS IS MY MARTY!

12:00.020 --> 12:01.521
HMM.
SIT DOWN, MARTY!

12:01.588 --> 12:02.522
OKAY, I GET IT.

12:02.589 --> 12:03.791
SO YOU WANT ME
IN YOUR CLUB,

12:03.857 --> 12:05.292
BUT YOU DON'T WANT ME
IN YOUR CLUB.

12:05.358 --> 12:07.494
I'M STARTING TO THINK
I DON'T WANT YOU IN EITHER,

12:07.560 --> 12:10.297
SO WHY DON'T YOU DO US
ALL A FAVOR, G-BAG?

12:10.363 --> 12:14.601
GRAB YOUR DOPP KIT AND GO DIG
YOUR CAR OUT OF SELF-PARKING!

12:14.667 --> 12:18.438
YOU ARE A POMPOUS BABY!

12:18.505 --> 12:20.107
YOU SAY THAT AGAIN--

12:20.173 --> 12:21.141
POMPOUS BABY!

12:21.208 --> 12:22.442
THAT'S IT. (grunts)
NO!

12:22.509 --> 12:23.576
NO!

12:23.643 --> 12:25.412
(both grunting)

12:25.478 --> 12:27.314
AAH!

12:27.380 --> 12:31.518
(yelling)

12:31.584 --> 12:32.685
I GOT YOU NOW.

12:32.752 --> 12:35.989
AAH! GET OFF ME!

12:36.056 --> 12:41.962
**

12:42.029 --> 12:43.463
(floor squeaks)
AAH.

12:43.530 --> 12:44.697
DR. WERNER, YOUR FACE!

12:44.764 --> 12:46.733
NOAH, RELAX--
(grunts)

12:46.800 --> 12:48.936
HEY!
HEY, GET OFF ME, YOU GOON!

12:49.002 --> 12:51.471
(all grunting and groaning)

12:51.538 --> 12:55.042
AAH! (grunts) OHH.

12:55.108 --> 12:56.076
(grunts)

12:56.143 --> 12:57.277
OHH!

12:57.344 --> 12:58.611
(snaps)
OW!

12:58.678 --> 13:00.213
UH, I'VE GOT A 2:00 TEE-OFF,

13:00.280 --> 13:03.016
SO I'M JUST GONNA
HEAD ON OUT OF HERE.

13:03.083 --> 13:06.386
SO SCOTT SAID THAT HE WOULD
GO OUT WITH DALIA?

13:06.453 --> 13:07.120
MM-HMM.

13:07.187 --> 13:08.388
(mouth full) THAT'S WEIRD.

13:08.455 --> 13:10.723
WHY? FROM I HEAR,
HE'S EXACTLY LIKE HER.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.159
HE IS NOTHING LIKE HER.

13:12.225 --> 13:15.762
HE JUST SPENT THE LAST YEAR
VOLUNTEERING IN ZAMBIA.

13:15.829 --> 13:17.464
HE HAS GLOBAL AWARENESS.

13:17.530 --> 13:18.698
REALLY?
YEAH.

13:18.765 --> 13:19.732
AFTER HE BROKE UP
WITH BRIANNA,

13:19.799 --> 13:21.034
SCOTT DEFERRED
CARNEGIE MELLON

13:21.101 --> 13:23.270
TO HELP
SICK, IMPOVERISHED ORPHANS.

13:23.336 --> 13:25.238
HE COOKED MEALS,
HELPED BUILD WELLS.

13:25.305 --> 13:26.840
HE MOUNTED A ZAMBIAN PRODUCTION
OF "PIPPIN,"

13:26.907 --> 13:28.775
WHICH I'M TOLD
WAS VERY WELL-RECEIVED.

13:28.842 --> 13:31.611
(chuckles)
THIS GUY SOUNDS AMAZING.

13:31.678 --> 13:34.547
WHY WOULD HE GO OUT WITH DALIA?
IT'S SUCH A WASTE.

13:34.614 --> 13:36.984
HE ALSO HELPED
CLEAN UP WASTE--

13:37.050 --> 13:39.286
ANOTHER BIG PROBLEM
IN THAT COUNTRY.

13:39.352 --> 13:41.188
(cell phone rings)

13:41.254 --> 13:42.189
(ring)

13:42.255 --> 13:44.024
HELLO?

13:45.292 --> 13:46.559
OH, HEY, DALIA.

13:46.626 --> 13:48.996
I WAS SO BUSY HEARING STORIES
ABOUT SCOTT STRAUSS,

13:49.062 --> 13:50.763
I FORGOT I HAD TO PICK UP
SCOTT STRAUSS,

13:50.830 --> 13:52.165
AND SINCE GEORGE TOOK
THE PRIUS,

13:52.232 --> 13:54.601
WE HAD TO RESORT TO PLAN "B"...

13:55.702 --> 13:57.304
AS IN BENTLEY.

13:57.370 --> 13:59.873
ALL I COULD THINK ABOUT
AS I RAN MY HANDS

13:59.940 --> 14:01.574
ACROSS THE ITALIAN LEATHER
STEERING WHEEL

14:01.641 --> 14:04.577
WAS NOT HOW MANY CHILDREN
IN ZAMBIA THIS COULD FEED,

14:04.644 --> 14:06.179
BUT HOW LONG WOULD IT BE
BEFORE I COULD AFFORD

14:06.246 --> 14:07.915
A WHIP LIKE THIS FOR MYSELF?

14:07.981 --> 14:12.219
ZAMBIA--IS THAT, LIKE,
AN ANTIDEPRESSANT?

14:12.285 --> 14:14.955
IS THAT THE ONE
THAT GIVES YOU DIARRHEA?

14:15.022 --> 14:17.824
NO, IT'S NOT.

14:17.891 --> 14:20.560
WE'RE HERE.

14:20.627 --> 14:22.162
(seat belt buckle clicks)

14:22.229 --> 14:25.332
(indistinct conversations)

14:27.334 --> 14:28.601
LOOK... (sighs)

14:28.668 --> 14:30.803
IT WAS REALLY COOL WHAT YOU DID,
SETTING ME UP WITH SCOTT,

14:30.870 --> 14:33.306
SO I JUST WANTED TO SAY...

14:36.743 --> 14:38.378
"THANKS"?

14:38.445 --> 14:39.779
YOU'RE WELCOME,

14:39.846 --> 14:42.449
AND SO AM I. (chuckles)

14:42.515 --> 14:44.985
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME
I HAD SEEN DALIA SMILE.

14:45.052 --> 14:48.755
SHE LOOKED SO... HUMAN.

14:48.821 --> 14:52.892
I GUESS IN SOME STRANGE WAY,
I WAS HAPPY THAT SHE WAS HAPPY.

14:55.662 --> 14:58.031
FORGOT MY WALLET.

14:58.098 --> 15:00.467
OH, AND I ASSUME YOU KNOW
THAT THE ONLY REASON I WENT

15:00.533 --> 15:02.769
ON THIS DATE WITH DALIA
WAS SO THAT I COULD SPEND

15:02.835 --> 15:04.871
SOME MORE TIME WITH YOU.

15:04.938 --> 15:06.539
TESSA, THIS IS HUGE.

15:06.606 --> 15:07.941
I KNOW.

15:08.008 --> 15:09.609
NO. NO, YOU DON'T.
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

15:09.676 --> 15:11.211
SCOTT STRAUSS LIKES YOU.

15:11.278 --> 15:13.713
I KNOW. I TOLD YOU THAT.

15:13.780 --> 15:15.748
(door opens)
THE LOSERS ARE WINNING.

15:15.815 --> 15:17.450
(singsongy)
THERE'S MY GIRL.

15:17.517 --> 15:18.885
(door closes)

15:18.952 --> 15:19.886
WHERE'S YOUR GIRL?

15:19.953 --> 15:21.821
THERE. YOU.

15:21.888 --> 15:23.323
SO, WHAT?

15:23.390 --> 15:26.960
LIKE, YOU GUYS ARE, LIKE,
FRIENDS NOW?

15:27.027 --> 15:28.761
(mouths word)

15:28.828 --> 15:30.230
AS DALIA TRIED TO WELCOME ME

15:30.297 --> 15:32.432
INTO A CLUB I HAD
NO INTENTION OF JOINING,

15:32.499 --> 15:33.800
GEORGE WAS FINDING
THAT HIS CLUB

15:33.866 --> 15:35.368
DIDN'T WANT HIMAS A MEMBER.

15:35.435 --> 15:37.470
WE'RE SO SORRY TO DENY
YOUR APPLICATION.

15:37.537 --> 15:40.840
DENY MY APPLICATION?
DID YOU READ MY ESSAY?

15:40.907 --> 15:42.542
WE DID...

15:42.609 --> 15:44.811
(men clear throats)

15:44.877 --> 15:46.146
BUT THERE WAS A DING.

15:46.213 --> 15:47.947
A DING?
SOMEBODY DINGED YOU,

15:48.015 --> 15:52.552
AND ONCE YOU'VE BEEN DINGED,
I'M AFRAID YOU CAN'T BE UN-DUNG.

15:52.619 --> 15:53.620
DANG.

15:53.686 --> 15:55.322
I... (sighs) WHO DINGED ME?

15:55.388 --> 15:56.889
Y-YOU KNOW WHAT?
DON'T EVEN TELL ME.

15:56.956 --> 15:58.291
IT WAS--IT WAS NOAH WERNER,
WASN'T IT?

15:58.358 --> 16:01.428
I'M SORRY, MR. ALTMAN.
ALL DINGS ARE ANONYMOUS,

16:01.494 --> 16:03.963
AND THAT IS, OF COURSE,
TO ENCOURAGE DINGING.

16:04.031 --> 16:06.066
(chuckles)

16:06.133 --> 16:07.767
YOUR APPLICATION IS DENIED.

16:07.834 --> 16:10.870
WELL, GEORGE... (sighs)
WE GAVE IT OUR BEST SHOT.

16:10.937 --> 16:14.674
SO CLOSE, TOO. YOU'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO LEAVE THE CLUB NOW.

16:14.741 --> 16:16.509
(clears throat)

16:16.576 --> 16:18.878
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO VISIT AFRICA.

16:18.945 --> 16:22.215
WAS THE SCENERY SO BEAUTIFUL YOU
COULDN'T EVEN CATCH YOUR BREATH?

16:23.283 --> 16:25.052
ACTUALLY, IT WAS KINDA
LIKE CHATSWIN,

16:25.118 --> 16:28.121
BUT WITH MORE ELEPHANTS.

16:28.188 --> 16:29.756
AND LESS COUGARS?

16:29.822 --> 16:31.124
I DON'T KNOW.

16:31.191 --> 16:34.527
SOME OF THOSE OLDER ZULU WOMEN
WERE... PRETTY HOT.

16:34.594 --> 16:35.495
(laughs)

16:35.562 --> 16:37.030
(laughs)

16:37.097 --> 16:39.899
HONESTLY,
EVERYTHING WAS SO VIVID.

16:39.966 --> 16:41.834
LIKE, YOU LOOK UP,

16:41.901 --> 16:44.304
AND THERE'S A TOTALLY DIFFERENT
MOON IN THE SKY.

16:44.371 --> 16:46.339
I WANTED TO SAY,
"WE SHOULDN'T DO THIS."

16:46.406 --> 16:48.275
I WANTED TO SAY,
"I KNOW DALIA LIKES YOU,

16:48.341 --> 16:49.876
"AND EVEN IF SHE AND I
AREN'T FRIENDS,

16:49.942 --> 16:53.380
IT'S STILL WRONG,"
BUT ALL I ACTUALLY SAID WAS...

16:53.446 --> 16:54.414
WOW.

16:59.552 --> 17:00.953
CONGRATULATIONS.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.489
WHAT'S THIS?

17:02.555 --> 17:04.757
WHAT'S IT LOOK LIKE?
IT'S A MEMBERSHIP CARD.

17:04.824 --> 17:05.925
I GOT YOU IN.

17:05.992 --> 17:07.760
I THOUGHT
I COULDN'T BE UN-DUNG.

17:07.827 --> 17:09.462
UN-DUNG?

17:09.529 --> 17:10.297
YOU DINGED ME.

17:10.363 --> 17:11.698
I DIDN'T DING YOU,

17:11.764 --> 17:13.966
ALTHOUGH I DID GIVE YOU
A SHINER, DIDN'T I?

17:14.033 --> 17:17.137
HEY, DON'T--DON'T KID YOURSELF.
THAT WAS FROM MARTY.

17:17.204 --> 17:18.571
SO WHY THE SUDDEN CHANGE
OF HEART?

17:18.638 --> 17:20.407
I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T WANT ME
IN YOUR CLUB.

17:20.473 --> 17:22.975
WHAT CAN I SAY?
I'M A CHILD, ALL RIGHT?

17:23.042 --> 17:24.744
I GAVE YOU A TOY
TO PLAY WITH

17:24.811 --> 17:28.248
AND THEN GOT UPSET
WHEN YOU WERE PLAYING WITH IT.

17:28.315 --> 17:30.350
I'M A FLAWED PERSON, GEORGE.
I AM.

17:30.417 --> 17:33.420
I WANTTO CHANGE. I DO.

17:33.486 --> 17:35.988
(whispers)
BUT I'M NEVER GOING TO...

17:36.055 --> 17:37.390
(normal voice)
SO I GOT YOU IN THE CLUB.

17:37.457 --> 17:39.025
I HAVEN'T FOUGHT LIKE THAT
SINCE I WAS A KID

17:39.092 --> 17:40.560
WITH MY BROTHER,

17:40.627 --> 17:42.995
WHICH MADE ME REALIZE,
YOU'RE LIKE FAMILY, GEORGE.

17:43.062 --> 17:47.100
WELL, THANKS, NOAH,

17:47.167 --> 17:48.335
BUT...
(cup clatters)

17:48.401 --> 17:50.637
TO BE HONEST,
GETTING DINGED WAS PROBABLY

17:50.703 --> 17:52.172
THE BEST THING
THAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED.

17:52.239 --> 17:53.640
I CAN'T AFFORD THE DUES
TO THAT PLACE.

17:53.706 --> 17:55.775
I CAN'T EVEN AFFORD
YOUR SHAMPOO.

17:55.842 --> 17:57.777
YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY DUES.

17:57.844 --> 18:00.580
LIKE I SAID, YOU'RE FAMILY,

18:00.647 --> 18:02.982
SO I ADDED YOU
TO MY FAMILY PLAN.

18:03.049 --> 18:05.051
WHAT? (laughs)

18:05.118 --> 18:06.419
"GEORGE WERNER"?

18:06.486 --> 18:08.221
WHAT, YOU ADDED ME
AS YOUR BROTHER?

18:08.288 --> 18:10.089
ACTUALLY, I ADDED YOU
AS MY SON,

18:10.157 --> 18:12.592
SO PLEASE
WATCH YOUR TONE WITH ME.

18:12.659 --> 18:14.961
SO WE'RE COUNTRY CLUB PEOPLE
NOW, HUH?

18:15.027 --> 18:16.263
(chuckles)

18:16.329 --> 18:18.231
SHOULDN'T WE HAVE PEOPLE
FOLDING THESE FOR US?

18:18.298 --> 18:20.333
I WOULDN'T CALL US
"COUNTRY CLUB PEOPLE."

18:20.400 --> 18:23.270
YOU KNOW,
WE--WE--WE BELONG TO A CLUB

18:23.336 --> 18:25.772
THAT HAPPENS TO...

18:25.838 --> 18:29.809
BE IN... THE COUNTRY.

18:29.876 --> 18:31.444
WE'RE COUNTRY CLUB PEOPLE.

18:31.511 --> 18:34.214
DID YOU EVER FIND OUT
WHO DINGED YOU?

18:34.281 --> 18:35.615
NO. NO,
AND IT'S DRIVING ME CRAZY.

18:35.682 --> 18:37.917
I HATE THE IDEA THAT
THERE'S SOMEBODY OUT THERE

18:37.984 --> 18:40.187
WHO HAS AN ANONYMOUS PROBLEM
WITH ME.

18:40.253 --> 18:41.754
COME RIGHT OUT
AND TELL ME TO MY FACE.

18:41.821 --> 18:43.290
BE A MAN, YOU KNOW?

18:43.356 --> 18:46.326
YEAH. I DID KNOW.

18:46.393 --> 18:49.296
I HAD TO BE A MAN.

18:54.367 --> 18:56.068
OH, MY GOSH, DALIA.

18:56.135 --> 18:57.837
SOMETHING SO, SO EXCITING
JUST HAPPENED.

18:57.904 --> 19:02.008
YOUR VERY GOOD FRIEND STOPPED BY
UNEXPECTEDLY TO PAY YOU A VISIT.

19:02.074 --> 19:02.975
KIMANTHA?
NO.

19:03.042 --> 19:04.244
KENZIE?
NO.

19:04.311 --> 19:05.912
KAITLYN?
NO, IT'S--

19:05.978 --> 19:06.913
SUE?
NO.

19:06.979 --> 19:08.915
IT'S ME. TESSA.

19:08.981 --> 19:10.383
OH.

19:10.450 --> 19:11.484
HEY.

19:11.551 --> 19:13.353
CAN I GET YOU GIRLS ANYTHING
TO DRINK?

19:13.420 --> 19:15.388
I COULD WHIP UP
SOME VIRGIN MARYS.

19:15.455 --> 19:17.857
I DON'T LET DALIA HAVE
HARD LIQUOR ON SCHOOL NIGHTS.

19:17.924 --> 19:20.059
NO, THANKS, DALLAS.
I'M NOT STAYING LONG.

19:20.126 --> 19:21.528
OKAY.

19:21.594 --> 19:22.895
I'M JUST MAKING A COLLAGE

19:22.962 --> 19:26.433
OF ME AND SCOTT STRAUSS
AND LIL WAYNE FOR MY LOCKER.

19:26.499 --> 19:29.068
THAT'S KINDA WHAT I WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

19:29.135 --> 19:30.970
WEEZY?
SCOTT STRAUSS.

19:31.037 --> 19:34.474
DALIA, SCOTT LIKES
SOMEONE ELSE,

19:34.541 --> 19:37.744
AND I WANTED YOU
TO HEAR IT FROM ME,

19:37.810 --> 19:38.878
BECAUSE IT'S ME.

19:40.947 --> 19:42.449
YEAH, RIGHT.
(scribbling)

19:42.515 --> 19:44.351
I HUNG OUT WITH HIM
YESTERDAY,

19:44.417 --> 19:46.085
BUT YOU LIKED HIM FIRST,

19:46.152 --> 19:47.987
SO I'M NOT GONNA SEE HIM
ANYMORE.

19:48.054 --> 19:49.722
YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING ME
SOME SORT OF FAVOR...

19:49.789 --> 19:50.757
(pen clatters)

19:50.823 --> 19:52.392
LETTING MY BOYFRIEND BE
MY BOYFRIEND?

19:52.459 --> 19:55.595
(scoffs)
HE'S NOT YOUR BOYFRIEND.

19:55.662 --> 19:57.830
HE ONLY WENT OUT WITH YOU
BECAUSE HE LIKES ME.

19:57.897 --> 20:00.733
TESSA, YOU REMIND ME
OF TYLER PERRY RIGHT NOW.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.869
YOU'RE JOKING,
BUT YOU'RE NOT FUNNY.

20:02.935 --> 20:04.704
I'M NOT JOKING,

20:04.771 --> 20:07.407
ALTHOUGH I DON'T DISAGREE
WITH YOU ABOUT TYLER PERRY.

20:07.474 --> 20:08.941
I DON'T KNOW EVEN KNOW
WHY I CAME HERE.

20:09.008 --> 20:13.280
YEAH, IT WAS DUMB, AND LET ME
SPELL OUT JUST HOW DUMB IT WAS.

20:13.346 --> 20:15.882
"D" IS FOR DALIA.
THAT'S MY NAME,

20:15.948 --> 20:19.151
AND "U" IS FOR YOU,
WHO SNAKED SCOTT STRAUSS,

20:19.218 --> 20:21.454
AND "M" IS
FOR MRS. SCOTT STRAUSS.

20:21.521 --> 20:22.889
THAT'S ALSO MY NAME.

20:22.955 --> 20:24.090
YOU FORGOT THE "B."

20:24.156 --> 20:27.327
NO, I DIDN'T, BEEYOTCH.
GAME ON.

20:27.394 --> 20:29.829
FINE. GAME ON...

20:30.830 --> 20:31.998
BEEYOTCH.

20:36.035 --> 20:38.471
(indistinct conversations)

20:38.538 --> 20:41.374
HEY, WALTER, KEEP YOUR HEAD DOWN
OUT THERE, ALL RIGHT?

20:41.441 --> 20:42.442
HA. THANKS.
(chuckles)

20:42.509 --> 20:43.843
WHAT DOES THAT
EVEN MEAN, GEORGE?

20:43.910 --> 20:47.246
I DON'T KNOW, BUT I HEARD
SOMEBODY ELSE SAY IT.

20:47.314 --> 20:49.015
MORNING, MR. ALTMAN.

20:49.081 --> 20:50.617
HELLO THERE, JOCELYN.
HOW ARE YOU?

20:50.683 --> 20:53.320
I HEAR YOU'RE A MEMBER NOW.
CONGRATULATIONS.

20:53.386 --> 20:54.721
YES, I AM A MEMBER,

20:54.787 --> 20:56.255
SO I GUESS WE'LL BE SEEING
A LOT OF EACH OTHER.

20:56.323 --> 20:57.724
RIGHT HERE IN THIS DINING ROOM
WE WILL BE,

20:57.790 --> 21:00.760
BUT OUTSIDE OF THE DINING ROOM,
NOT SO MUCH. (sighs)

21:00.827 --> 21:02.295
CLUB MEMBERS
CAN'T DATE EMPLOYEES.

21:02.362 --> 21:04.297
IT'S AGAINST THE RULES.
(inhales deeply)

21:04.364 --> 21:06.833
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK
WITH SOME CREAM.

21:09.702 --> 21:10.903
DING.

21:10.970 --> 21:12.238
DING?

21:12.305 --> 21:15.141
(glass clinks)

21:15.207 --> 21:16.343
(whispers) DING.

21:16.409 --> 21:17.877
LET'S FACE IT.

21:17.944 --> 21:19.646
WE DON'T FIT IN.
WE DON'T LOOK LIKE THEM.

21:19.712 --> 21:21.280
WE DON'T ACT LIKE THEM,

21:21.348 --> 21:23.249
AND WE DEFINITELY DON'T PLAY
BY THEIR RULES,

21:23.316 --> 21:25.385
BUT TWO THINGS
WILL ALWAYS BE TRUE--

21:25.452 --> 21:27.554
THEY POACH THE HELL OUT
OF AN EGG,

21:27.620 --> 21:29.889
AND I HAVE MY DRIVER'S LICENSE.
