00:05.839 --> 00:07.475
<i>Previously on</i> Fire Country...

00:07.575 --> 00:09.110
<i>I ran into some money issues.</i>

00:09.210 --> 00:10.444
27. Bust.

00:10.544 --> 00:11.779
I lost the house, <i>mija.</i>

00:13.347 --> 00:14.582
My lab results posted.

00:14.682 --> 00:15.816
<i>Become transplant eligible</i>

00:15.916 --> 00:18.252
and almost kill yourself
on the same day.

00:18.352 --> 00:20.354
<i>When I saw you jump,</i>

00:20.454 --> 00:21.922
all I saw was...

00:22.022 --> 00:23.291
<i>you jumping for Bode.</i>

00:23.391 --> 00:25.359
I can't be with you
if my heart is not

00:25.459 --> 00:26.827
<i>fully with you.</i>

00:26.927 --> 00:28.662
Thank you for
coming, Luke.

00:29.463 --> 00:31.865
My brother's
a very lucky man.

00:38.239 --> 00:41.275
"Chief Leone's Donor 'n Motor
Kidney Raiser.

00:41.375 --> 00:44.245
"Event will be held
at Smokey's Tavern,

00:44.345 --> 00:46.414
the heart of
her community--" Hey!

00:46.514 --> 00:48.982
Evel Knievel,
you can't stop for a second

00:49.083 --> 00:52.286
and listen to
how people love you so much

00:52.386 --> 00:54.355
they want to line up
to give you a kidney?

00:54.455 --> 00:55.856
Come on.

00:55.956 --> 00:57.558
You know I hate attention. Well...

00:57.658 --> 00:59.193
with any luck,
the attention will be on

00:59.293 --> 01:01.362
me and Luke
and the band.

01:01.462 --> 01:03.797
It's been a minute, uh...

01:03.897 --> 01:06.567
Might be able to get this guitar
in tune with my voice.

01:06.667 --> 01:08.569
Your voice? I don't know
mine's ever coming back

01:08.669 --> 01:10.704
after giving Cara CPR.

01:10.804 --> 01:12.906
My immune system's
just so tired.

01:13.006 --> 01:14.708
You sound pretty
rock and roll to me.

01:14.808 --> 01:16.377
Maybe you should
front the band today.

01:17.178 --> 01:20.348
What? Your voice is
what won my heart,

01:20.448 --> 01:22.015
Vince Springsteen.

01:22.116 --> 01:25.853
Well, I just hope I got a kidney
that's gonna win it over now.

01:25.953 --> 01:28.055
I can't wait
for you to test

01:28.156 --> 01:30.958
so somebody other than me
can tell you you're probably

01:31.058 --> 01:33.060
too old.
Bode's not.

01:33.161 --> 01:34.362
Okay, stop it.

01:34.462 --> 01:35.529
I'm not taking an
organ from my kid.

01:35.629 --> 01:36.830
And why are you ruining

01:36.930 --> 01:38.799
this groupie moment
right here?

01:40.033 --> 01:42.636
How come the lead singers
always get the girl?

01:42.736 --> 01:45.706
Oh, Vince could've
played a kazoo

01:45.806 --> 01:48.709
and he would've
stolen my heart.
Of course.

01:48.809 --> 01:51.479
You two are Edgewater's
favorite couple.

01:51.579 --> 01:53.681
Loving, loyal...

01:53.781 --> 01:55.816
Generous,
especially to Manny.

01:56.650 --> 01:58.452
Manny deserves that job.

01:58.552 --> 01:59.787
LUKE No, I was
talking about

01:59.887 --> 02:02.089
the $10,000 loan
that you guys gave him.

02:02.190 --> 02:04.592
Who does that?

02:04.692 --> 02:06.927
I don't know.
Who does do that?

02:07.027 --> 02:08.396
Uh...

02:09.096 --> 02:10.964
Manny came to me

02:11.064 --> 02:13.100
while-while Luke
and I were rehearsing.

02:14.702 --> 02:16.970
Look,
Manny's in a pinch.

02:17.070 --> 02:18.906
Said he needed money,

02:19.006 --> 02:20.808
said he'd pay me
right back, so...

02:20.908 --> 02:22.343
So you gave it to him
without consulting me.

02:23.444 --> 02:25.179
Wow.

02:25.279 --> 02:28.749
Leone brothers
and their lack of boundaries.

02:33.954 --> 02:35.623
What the hell did
she mean by that?

02:35.723 --> 02:38.192
I don't know.
She's your wife.

02:40.594 --> 02:43.030
<i>Hey, no, I'm sorry,
I can't hear you.</i>

02:44.732 --> 02:47.335
No, ma'am, it's not a chopper.
It's choppers.

02:57.611 --> 03:00.314
Is it him?
Oh, my God, it's him.

03:00.414 --> 03:02.182
He's just like his picture.
Sorry, can you hold on
one second?

03:03.016 --> 03:05.253
"The Leones' inmate
firefighter son,

03:05.353 --> 03:07.721
Bode, makes them proud."

03:07.821 --> 03:09.390
That's you, brah!

03:09.490 --> 03:11.091
Yeah.

03:11.191 --> 03:12.893
3:00 p.m.?

03:12.993 --> 03:14.161
Thank you.

03:14.262 --> 03:16.163
You look like Fire Camp Fabio.

03:16.264 --> 03:18.532
You know, your life could be
a romance novel,

03:18.632 --> 03:22.303
now that
Cap's daughter is single!

03:22.403 --> 03:23.604
Shh.

03:23.704 --> 03:24.972
Has anyone seen Cap?

03:25.072 --> 03:26.874
I think he's in his
office, brooding.

03:26.974 --> 03:29.277
Dude has a serious case
of man-o-pause.

03:29.377 --> 03:31.745
...are neck and neck.
Now Sarah Swift...

03:31.845 --> 03:33.581
Come on, come on,
come on.

03:33.681 --> 03:35.015
...and Sarah Swift.

03:35.115 --> 03:37.485
Ticket's Revenge
and Sarah Swift!
Come on, run.

03:37.585 --> 03:38.686
Sarah Swift now breaking away!
Run.

03:38.786 --> 03:40.988
No.
No, no, no, no,

03:41.088 --> 03:42.823
no, no!
Incredible!

03:42.923 --> 03:44.692
Damn it!

03:58.138 --> 03:59.773
What do you need?

03:59.873 --> 04:03.711
Look, uh... you know that
my mom needs a kidney donor.

04:03.811 --> 04:05.746
And since I'm
her blood relative,

04:05.846 --> 04:07.615
I'm-I'm likely
her-her best shot at a match.

04:07.715 --> 04:10.017
Put in a request
with the DOC.

04:10.117 --> 04:12.252
Yeah, but
that'll take months.

04:12.353 --> 04:13.587
Listen,
I, uh...

04:14.388 --> 04:17.558
I scheduled an appointment
to get tested... today.

04:18.492 --> 04:21.194
Cap, you're always saying
that you owe my mom, right?

04:21.295 --> 04:22.596
I do.

04:22.696 --> 04:24.031
A lot.

04:24.131 --> 04:25.666
Then this is your chance
to be a lifesaver, man.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.167
Literally.

04:46.654 --> 04:48.689
Mama.

04:48.789 --> 04:50.524
Oh...
Thank you so much.

04:50.624 --> 04:52.192
And it's all for you.
Come on in.

04:53.361 --> 04:55.429
All these people
here for me?

04:55.529 --> 04:56.830
Yeah.
Oh...

04:56.930 --> 04:58.632
Baby, what's wrong
with your voice?

04:58.732 --> 05:01.402
It's shot. And now I have
to talk to everybody?

05:01.502 --> 05:03.337
I'm gonna die. Jake...

05:03.437 --> 05:04.805
you remember
the Burnetts?

05:04.905 --> 05:07.375
Oh, yeah.
Cal Fire Chief legends.
Oh, no.

05:07.475 --> 05:09.343
It's just
Dolly and Paulie now.

05:09.443 --> 05:10.578
Happy to be retired.

05:10.678 --> 05:11.912
I bet. Aw...

05:12.012 --> 05:13.280
Let's get you a drink. Yeah.

05:16.049 --> 05:17.017
Hey.

05:17.117 --> 05:19.186
Um... sorry.

05:19.286 --> 05:21.154
Um... Hi.

05:21.254 --> 05:22.423
All right.

05:26.694 --> 05:29.062
Um...
Yeah, how is housesitting

05:29.162 --> 05:32.332
at Eve's place while
she's at IC training?

05:32.433 --> 05:34.668
Honestly, it's kind of lonely.

05:36.437 --> 05:40.874
You know, my place is quiet,
too, now that you're gone.

05:43.711 --> 05:46.380
You know, it is what it is.

05:46.480 --> 05:47.881
Have fun.

05:52.386 --> 05:53.454
Jake Crawford?

05:53.554 --> 05:55.322
Cara?

05:56.624 --> 05:57.891
Uh, you back in town?

05:57.991 --> 05:59.660
Until my mom's house
sells, yeah.

05:59.760 --> 06:02.062
Ah.
It's been a minute, Jake.

06:02.162 --> 06:04.598
Yeah, yeah.
It's been too long.

06:04.698 --> 06:06.467
You know, let's
catch up sometime.

06:06.567 --> 06:08.135
I'd love that.

06:08.235 --> 06:09.637
Same.

06:13.206 --> 06:15.576
This is
confidential, right?

06:15.676 --> 06:17.177
My... my mom
won't find out?

06:17.277 --> 06:20.113
Yes. You'll have preliminary
results in a week.

06:20.213 --> 06:22.616
I would have never agreed
to this if I knew

06:22.716 --> 06:23.684
it was against
your mom's wishes.

06:25.619 --> 06:26.887
Cap, if I'm a match...

06:26.987 --> 06:29.557
both my parents are
going to thank you.

06:32.359 --> 06:35.128
So here's to getting
the band back together.

06:35.228 --> 06:37.197
Yeah.
Hear.

06:38.131 --> 06:41.902
All right, I... I know
when Sharon's back is up.

06:43.003 --> 06:44.638
Go ahead.
Tell me.

06:44.738 --> 06:46.206
Wh-What happened
with you two?

06:46.306 --> 06:47.274
Oh, nothing.

06:47.374 --> 06:49.009
Sharon shut that down
right away.

06:50.343 --> 06:53.013
She shut...?
She shut what down?

06:53.113 --> 06:54.982
It was nothing.
I said you were a lucky guy

06:55.082 --> 06:56.850
to be married to her,
that's all.

07:00.187 --> 07:01.855
Are you telling me
you hit on my wife?
What? It was--

07:01.955 --> 07:03.957
Did you hit on my wife?
I didn't hit on--
No, it was a mistake.

07:04.057 --> 07:06.026
What is actually wrong...
I am sorry, okay?

07:06.126 --> 07:08.128
Oh, no, no.
Luke and Vince.

07:08.228 --> 07:09.530
What's wrong? I'm sorry,
I'm the d-bag brother?

07:09.630 --> 07:11.765
Oh, brother band drama.
I got it.

07:11.865 --> 07:13.601
...black and white,
and there's absolutely...
All right.

07:13.701 --> 07:15.503
no margin for error,
while anything...
Boys, boys, boys,

07:15.603 --> 07:16.904
boys, boys,
boys, boys, hey.

07:17.004 --> 07:18.572
Time and
a place, yeah?

07:18.672 --> 07:20.073
Come on.
Let's cut that.

07:20.173 --> 07:22.576
Let's go.
Yeah, it's gonna be good.
Yeah. All right.

07:22.676 --> 07:24.411
All right. Smokey's!

07:24.512 --> 07:25.979
Who's fired up, huh?

07:31.652 --> 07:34.421
My dad's not here?
Yeah, I was
looking for him.

07:34.522 --> 07:36.890
All right, my friends...
Something's up with him.

07:36.990 --> 07:38.526
I can't get an honest answer
out of him.

07:38.626 --> 07:40.027
He keeps dodging me and...

07:41.562 --> 07:43.831
Do you know something?

07:44.832 --> 07:46.767
He borrowed money from us.

07:47.701 --> 07:49.770
Luke and Vince...

07:49.870 --> 07:51.905
He racked up a huge balance

07:52.005 --> 07:53.173
on my credit card
a few weeks ago.

07:53.273 --> 07:56.309
And he...
he lost the house.

07:56.409 --> 07:57.578
Oh.

07:57.678 --> 07:59.079
Probably some arm-twisting...

07:59.179 --> 08:03.050
Okay, so he's in a money
hole and he's isolating.

08:03.150 --> 08:05.118
That behavior feels familiar.

08:05.218 --> 08:07.821
No, he-he's not drinking again.

08:07.921 --> 08:09.489
I think I would be able to tell.

08:09.590 --> 08:12.660
No, I have a brother
who was a gambling addict.

08:12.760 --> 08:16.029
And Manny's behavior
just feels familiar.

08:16.129 --> 08:18.566
I want you to give it up

08:18.666 --> 08:19.733
for Fire to Burn!

08:22.703 --> 08:24.304
All right.

08:25.873 --> 08:28.108
Thanks, everybody,
for coming out.

08:28.208 --> 08:29.910
Thanks for getting screened.

08:30.010 --> 08:32.445
We're gonna play

10:46.346 --> 10:48.548
I-I don't know. Uh...

10:49.883 --> 10:52.252
All right. Everybody.

10:52.352 --> 10:54.021
Let's drink up.
Have a good time.

10:54.121 --> 10:56.323
Let's remember
why we're here, okay?

10:56.423 --> 10:57.657
Luke, let's play.
No, that's it!

10:57.758 --> 11:00.227
We just--
We can reschedule it. Now,

11:00.327 --> 11:02.429
now, I want to go home.

11:02.529 --> 11:04.531
Oh, come on.

11:13.606 --> 11:14.708
<i>Hey, Cap.</i>

11:14.808 --> 11:16.476
I don't mean to pry
and all...

11:16.576 --> 11:18.378
Then don't.

11:18.478 --> 11:19.780
But you're hardly sleeping.

11:19.880 --> 11:22.215
When you are,
it's in the office, and...

11:22.315 --> 11:23.751
Look, Gabriela mentioned--

11:23.851 --> 11:25.218
There's no need to be
concerned, all right?

11:25.318 --> 11:26.286
Whoa.

11:26.386 --> 11:27.254
Hey, Captain.

11:27.354 --> 11:28.355
Looks like a really bad

11:28.455 --> 11:29.389
motorcycle accident up there.

11:29.489 --> 11:31.224
Looks like two people down.

11:31.324 --> 11:33.093
Wait, that's my mom's bike.

11:34.394 --> 11:35.863
Mom! Mom!
Sharon!

11:35.963 --> 11:37.264
Sharon?

11:37.364 --> 11:38.932
Hey, Mom.

11:39.032 --> 11:40.200
Sharon...

11:42.135 --> 11:43.603
Aunt Dolly?

11:43.703 --> 11:47.007
Your mom asked me
to take her bike home.

11:50.577 --> 11:53.146
Chief Burnett?
Ugh...

11:53.246 --> 11:55.783
Manny, long time no see.

11:55.883 --> 11:57.951
Paulie!
Doll?

11:58.051 --> 12:00.620
You all right?
Paulie, I'm sorry.

12:00.720 --> 12:03.456
I had to dump the bike.
I couldn't stop.

12:03.556 --> 12:05.959
You just hang in there.

12:06.059 --> 12:08.061
Listen,
I got you now.

12:08.161 --> 12:09.229
Just hold tight.

12:09.329 --> 12:10.864
Greencrest.
This is Three Rock.

12:10.964 --> 12:13.600
We got a new incident.
We got a motorcycle accident.

12:13.700 --> 12:14.868
1200 Cedar Lane.

12:14.968 --> 12:16.736
We got two patients,
multiple injuries.

12:16.837 --> 12:18.972
Start two Code 3 ambulances.

12:19.072 --> 12:21.174
Brakes failed...

12:21.274 --> 12:23.310
I hit Paulie.

12:28.648 --> 12:30.683
Hold on.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.055
Brakes didn't fail.

12:35.155 --> 12:36.790
They were cut.

12:36.890 --> 12:37.958
Who would do that?

12:38.058 --> 12:39.893
Hey, hey. Who
would do that?

12:39.993 --> 12:43.530
Who would do that?
Fight at Smokey's.

12:43.630 --> 12:45.598
Outlaw bikers.

12:45.698 --> 12:47.300
Hey, easy, okay?

12:47.400 --> 12:49.736
Slow, slow, deep breaths,
all right? Deep breaths.

12:50.938 --> 12:52.672
They have tombstone patches?

12:57.177 --> 12:59.546
Shh, shh, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hey, listen.

12:59.646 --> 13:01.381
You heard Uncle Paulie.

13:01.481 --> 13:02.649
You heard him.
Hang in there.

13:02.749 --> 13:04.517
My arm, my arm.
Just leave it.

13:04.617 --> 13:05.886
Leave it.
Chief, your leg's burnt.

13:05.986 --> 13:07.754
It's caught under
the tailpipe.

13:07.855 --> 13:10.824
Yeah, and I got bone
sticking out of my forearm.

13:10.924 --> 13:12.492
Manny, we need medics.

13:12.592 --> 13:13.827
Let me see your phone.

13:13.927 --> 13:15.162
Here. Come on.
That's right.

13:15.262 --> 13:18.565
Oh. Oh...

13:18.665 --> 13:20.868
Mom? Mom, it's Bode.

13:20.968 --> 13:22.269
Hi.

13:22.369 --> 13:23.636
Look, D-Dolly and Paulie--

13:23.736 --> 13:24.838
Crashed.

13:24.938 --> 13:26.874
We're behind you.
Turn around.

13:27.674 --> 13:29.809
Oh, my God.

13:30.978 --> 13:32.412
Mom! Hey, hey,
she can't breathe!

13:32.512 --> 13:34.447
Paulie's got second and
third-degree burns on his calf

13:34.547 --> 13:35.715
and multiple fractures.

13:35.815 --> 13:37.450
All right. How we
doing, brother?

13:37.550 --> 13:40.487
Oh...
Okay, Jake, Gabriela,
you're on Dolly with me.

13:40.587 --> 13:42.055
Copy, Chief.

13:42.155 --> 13:44.557
Okay, okay.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.726
It's not my neck.
My ribs, my ribs.

13:46.826 --> 13:49.229
Mom, she's-she's really, she's
really struggling to breathe.

13:49.329 --> 13:50.898
Her heart is racing.

13:50.998 --> 13:52.765
Yeah.
Paradoxical chest movement.

13:52.866 --> 13:55.869
Feels like broken ribs.
Possible lung puncture.

13:55.969 --> 13:57.670
Come on, Dolly,
you stay with us.

13:57.770 --> 13:59.606
You do not go to sleep, okay?

13:59.706 --> 14:00.707
Chief, she has JVD.

14:00.807 --> 14:01.708
What's that mean?

14:01.808 --> 14:03.911
Jugular vein distention.

14:05.245 --> 14:08.148
It's a deviated trachea. Yeah.
All signs of a tension pneumo.

14:08.248 --> 14:09.516
She can't wait.

14:09.616 --> 14:11.084
You want to do a needle
thoracostomy on the side

14:11.184 --> 14:12.619
of the road?
Yeah, uh, just
don't have a needle

14:12.719 --> 14:13.786
and I've never done
one of these before.

14:13.887 --> 14:15.288
I have.

14:16.023 --> 14:17.290
Kind of, sort of.

14:18.458 --> 14:19.859
In the ER.

14:19.960 --> 14:22.329
Cara, I heard you left town.
Yeah, I heard you did, too.

14:22.429 --> 14:24.097
Well, it's really good
that you're both back here

14:24.197 --> 14:28.135
'cause Dolly needs you,
and we have no needle.

14:28.235 --> 14:29.602
How about a knife?

14:29.702 --> 14:30.770
In my boot.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.305
In your boot...

14:37.277 --> 14:38.511
Okay, great.

14:38.611 --> 14:40.713
Now all we need is
some alcohol to clean this with.

14:40.813 --> 14:43.716
Other boot.
Your other boot.

14:43.816 --> 14:46.786
Why am
I not surprised?

14:46.886 --> 14:48.521
She's a legend.

14:50.590 --> 14:51.992
That leg gets any crispier,

14:52.092 --> 14:53.860
then you're gonna have to put it
on the menu at Smokey's.

14:53.961 --> 14:55.595
Ah...
Ready.

14:57.197 --> 14:59.166
Ah! Oh...

15:02.269 --> 15:04.737
(groans) All
right, give it to me.

15:04.837 --> 15:07.274
How many bones I break?

15:07.374 --> 15:11.378
Open compound fracture,
radius and ulna.

15:11.478 --> 15:14.747
Uh, your wrist is dislocated and
fingers are pretty dinged up.

15:14.847 --> 15:16.116
Great.

15:17.050 --> 15:19.819
Figured we'd run into
each other at some point.

15:19.919 --> 15:20.820
You two went to school together?

15:20.920 --> 15:22.990
High school sweethearts.

15:23.090 --> 15:25.125
Yeah, well, a lot's happened
since then.

15:25.225 --> 15:27.860
Lot happening now.
What's the holdup?

15:27.961 --> 15:28.861
Just sterilizing the knife.

15:28.962 --> 15:30.230
Okay.
Bode!

15:30.330 --> 15:32.032
Grab all the tools
you can off the buggy.

15:32.132 --> 15:34.467
You grab the first aid kit.

15:37.270 --> 15:39.106
You cool?
I'm about as cool as a guy

15:39.206 --> 15:42.109
whose mom got her brakes
cut by some punk bikers.

15:42.209 --> 15:43.576
You?

15:43.676 --> 15:46.846
Mm. About as cool as a girl
whose dad may have blown money

15:46.946 --> 15:49.049
he borrowed
from your parents.

15:49.149 --> 15:51.451
That's what's going
on with Cap?

15:51.551 --> 15:54.221
Yeah, money stuff.
Uh, just-- He may be gambling.

15:54.321 --> 15:57.257
I don't, I don't know,
which is driving me crazy.

15:58.091 --> 15:59.792
I'm sorry. Yeah.

15:59.892 --> 16:01.194
Me, too. Hey.

16:01.294 --> 16:02.862
But we're gonna stay
on task, right?

16:02.962 --> 16:05.098
We're not gonna react
to my dad's issues,

16:05.198 --> 16:07.634
or the guy who cut
your mom's brakes, right?

16:07.734 --> 16:09.169
Yeah.

16:15.575 --> 16:17.610
Okay, hold the knife
and I'll guide you.

16:17.710 --> 16:19.712
All right.
You have to find space
between the fourth

16:19.812 --> 16:21.148
and fifth
intercostal space.

16:21.248 --> 16:25.518
Ribs, right.
Okay, hang on, Dolly.

16:25.618 --> 16:28.555
Two, three and four...

16:28.655 --> 16:30.657
Okay.
All right, Dolly,

16:30.757 --> 16:33.026
this isn't gonna
feel good, okay?

16:33.126 --> 16:35.195
It's okay,
Dolly's a tough chick.

16:36.896 --> 16:38.665
Okay.
I'm sorry.

16:38.765 --> 16:40.333
Good. Good.

16:40.433 --> 16:42.835
Okay, now put your fingers
in, through the muscle

16:42.935 --> 16:45.004
into the pleural space.
Got it.

16:45.105 --> 16:46.539
Okay, Dolly,
if you live through this,

16:46.639 --> 16:47.740
I am gonna give you my bike.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.842
I... I don't want your bike.

16:49.942 --> 16:52.445
I want you to get a kidney.

16:52.545 --> 16:53.780
Mm-hmm.

16:53.880 --> 16:56.483
Good. Okay.
All right.

16:56.583 --> 16:58.318
Mm...

16:58.418 --> 17:01.121
Good, good.

17:01.221 --> 17:02.589
Okay, now,

17:02.689 --> 17:04.157
now get your finger in there...

17:04.257 --> 17:06.459
Okay.
...and your finger's
gonna be the valve.

17:08.228 --> 17:10.029
Ah, there we go.

17:10.130 --> 17:12.665
There you go.

17:12.765 --> 17:14.301
Do you hear that air?

17:14.401 --> 17:17.737
Is that bad thing?
No, that's the sound
of it working.

17:20.006 --> 17:21.241
Pretty job. Pretty job.

17:25.112 --> 17:26.546
It's about time.

17:43.296 --> 17:46.166
Hey, where
do you think you're going?

17:46.266 --> 17:47.634
Bode!
Bode, no.

17:47.734 --> 17:48.868
Got it?

17:48.968 --> 17:50.270
Bode, don't!

17:50.370 --> 17:51.571
Which one of you fools
cut my mom's brakes?

17:51.671 --> 17:53.506
Slow your roll and listen.

17:53.606 --> 17:54.841
No, no. Bode.

17:54.941 --> 17:56.409
No, you listen.
I did time with bikers.

17:56.509 --> 17:58.411
There's a code when
it comes to civilians.

17:58.511 --> 18:00.313
A code that we live by.

18:00.413 --> 18:02.215
When we found out

18:02.315 --> 18:04.784
Odin cut the brakes,
we kicked him out of the club.

18:04.884 --> 18:07.120
Odin?
Ma'am.

18:07.220 --> 18:10.089
We got nothing against
firefighters, or you.

18:10.190 --> 18:13.360
But Odin held a grudge.

18:13.460 --> 18:16.696
You kicked him out of
some camp up here years ago?

18:16.796 --> 18:18.698
This wasn't a bar fight. Chief.

18:18.798 --> 18:19.699
It's a vendetta.

18:19.799 --> 18:21.000
Odin is Owen Fletcher

18:21.100 --> 18:22.335
from when I was
an inmate at Three Rock.

18:22.435 --> 18:26.139
"Odin" is his nickname.
God of war.

18:26.239 --> 18:28.308
I didn't
remember him.

18:28.408 --> 18:30.510
Guys like that don't like
to be overlooked.

18:32.412 --> 18:34.381
Where is he now?
Not with us.

18:34.481 --> 18:37.116
With nothing to lose
now that he's kicked out.

18:39.051 --> 18:41.488
Now my mom's his prey.

18:49.061 --> 18:50.497
All right.
I just got off with Cara

18:50.597 --> 18:53.333
at the hospital. Um...

18:53.433 --> 18:55.635
Paulie's still in surgery.

18:55.735 --> 18:57.837
Dolly's gonna make
a full recovery.

18:57.937 --> 19:00.673
Broadcasting our personal life
in print

19:00.773 --> 19:02.942
is just tempting karma.

19:03.042 --> 19:06.579
Except Paulie and
Dolly got our karma.

19:07.847 --> 19:09.682
Well...

19:09.782 --> 19:12.285
We never could have known
that this con camp reject

19:12.385 --> 19:14.787
was gonna show up.
I should've.

19:14.887 --> 19:18.691
Owen was a troublemaker,
but he had potential.

19:18.791 --> 19:20.092
He was First Saw.

19:20.193 --> 19:22.028
I'm the one that sent
him back to prison.

19:22.128 --> 19:24.431
Maybe if I had
given him a chance,

19:24.531 --> 19:26.533
he could've turned
into a decent guy.

19:26.633 --> 19:28.435
Decent guys don't cut
people's brakes.

19:28.535 --> 19:29.936
Okay?

19:30.036 --> 19:32.038
And Manny told me

19:32.138 --> 19:33.273
that he tried to get
Manny to drink.

19:33.373 --> 19:34.441
He's an enabler.

19:34.541 --> 19:36.609
You're being an enabler

19:36.709 --> 19:38.177
right now.

19:38.278 --> 19:39.779
I think Manny has
a gambling problem.

19:39.879 --> 19:41.948
You loaned him our money
without telling me?

19:42.048 --> 19:44.016
Well...

19:44.116 --> 19:47.520
You didn't tell me that
my brother made a pass at you.

19:47.620 --> 19:48.721
He hit on you?

19:48.821 --> 19:50.923
Really?
Why would I tell you that?

19:51.023 --> 19:52.459
What good would
that do for us

19:52.559 --> 19:54.060
with your temper?

19:54.160 --> 19:57.564
Uh...
deputies are posted outside.

19:57.664 --> 19:58.765
Police searched

19:58.865 --> 20:00.433
Odin's place
in Saw Valley.

20:00.533 --> 20:01.901
He's MIA.

20:02.001 --> 20:04.271
Some unhinged dude who wants
to kill you is out there?

20:04.371 --> 20:06.072
Yeah, we're-we're staying put.

20:06.172 --> 20:09.242
The only unhinged dude
I'm worried about is Bode.

20:09.342 --> 20:11.611
This is the reason
my mom's on this guy's radar.

20:12.612 --> 20:15.948
Swear to God, man.
You don't mess with
women and children.

20:16.048 --> 20:18.451
Everybody knows that!
That's right.

20:18.551 --> 20:20.019
Man, if this was prison--

20:20.119 --> 20:22.088
It's not prison.

20:22.989 --> 20:24.557
So stop acting like it.

20:24.657 --> 20:27.527
That guy got kicked out because
he didn't follow the rules.

20:27.627 --> 20:29.128
You guys want to join him?

20:29.228 --> 20:31.163
Nu-uh.
No, sir.

20:31.264 --> 20:32.565
All right, then.

20:32.665 --> 20:33.866
No, hey.

20:33.966 --> 20:35.134
You expect me to sit tight

20:35.234 --> 20:36.769
while this guy's out here
hunting my mom?

20:36.869 --> 20:37.837
Bode, no more field trips, man.

20:37.937 --> 20:39.038
You need to ramp down, not up.

20:39.138 --> 20:40.373
Oh, yeah?

20:40.473 --> 20:41.741
You know, Gabriela and I
have been comparing notes.

20:41.841 --> 20:43.776
Seems like
I'm listening to a guy

20:43.876 --> 20:44.977
doesn't walk the walk.

20:45.077 --> 20:46.946
You watch the way
you talk to me.

20:58.591 --> 21:01.328
Dolly's gonna make it.

21:02.629 --> 21:04.564
I heard.

21:04.664 --> 21:07.534
Is this how we are now?

21:07.634 --> 21:10.269
Professional in the field,

21:10.370 --> 21:12.138
and walls up, resentful,

21:12.238 --> 21:13.340
passive-aggressive

21:13.440 --> 21:15.041
everywhere else?
I'm heartbroken, Gabs.

21:15.141 --> 21:17.209
So am I.

21:19.245 --> 21:20.380
But you chose him.

21:20.480 --> 21:21.848
It wasn't a choice.

21:21.948 --> 21:24.917
I wish I didn't feel this way.

21:30.089 --> 21:31.691
Hello?

21:32.925 --> 21:34.961
Bode?

21:35.061 --> 21:37.063
<i>Mija,</i> it's me.

21:37.163 --> 21:38.931
I, uh...

21:39.031 --> 21:41.968
I-- I haven't been the dad
that you deserve.

21:44.103 --> 21:46.406
And, uh...

21:46.506 --> 21:48.240
I owe you some answers.

21:49.976 --> 21:51.844
You lost the house.

21:53.212 --> 21:56.649
And Sharon said that you
borrowed money from them?

21:57.550 --> 21:59.185
Dad...

21:59.285 --> 22:00.853
Are you gambling?

22:00.953 --> 22:03.890
Because nothing else
makes sense.

22:06.325 --> 22:07.727
Yes.

22:09.128 --> 22:10.730
Call me when you're ready
to get help.

22:10.830 --> 22:13.265
Whoa, hey. Right now...

22:13.366 --> 22:16.035
Right now, Bode needs
more help than I do.

22:16.135 --> 22:17.737
And I think
he'll listen to you.

22:17.837 --> 22:19.772
How do you know?

22:20.607 --> 22:22.975
The moment you two crawled
your way out of those woods,

22:23.075 --> 22:24.377
I saw your connection.

22:25.645 --> 22:27.847
Use it for good.

22:31.751 --> 22:32.952
That was my dad.

22:33.052 --> 22:34.821
I'm going to Three Rock.

22:34.921 --> 22:36.255
Bode's spiraling.

22:36.355 --> 22:38.858
You know what?
I get it now.

22:38.958 --> 22:41.093
Firefighters, we get a rush
out of rescuing people.

22:41.193 --> 22:45.364
But your rush is
rescuing people emotionally.

22:45.465 --> 22:47.099
Your dad,

22:47.199 --> 22:48.367
Bode...

22:48.468 --> 22:49.702
Even me.

22:49.802 --> 22:51.838
Everybody deserves
to be rescued, Jake.

23:16.996 --> 23:18.831
What are you
doing out here?

23:19.766 --> 23:21.868
Same thing you are.

23:21.968 --> 23:24.070
Protecting people
I care about.

23:25.672 --> 23:27.674
Bode, you do
something stupid,

23:27.774 --> 23:30.142
you pursue this guy,

23:30.242 --> 23:33.245
and you hurt everyone
you care about.

23:33.345 --> 23:37.349
My dad, your crew,
your parents...

23:38.350 --> 23:39.986
What about you?

23:44.156 --> 23:45.958
I'd be heartbroken.

23:48.895 --> 23:52.431
Back down, Bode.
Go back inside.

23:53.265 --> 23:56.168
That's how
you protect your mom.

24:04.511 --> 24:06.078
You have a future.

24:08.981 --> 24:11.417
Don't throw it away.

24:13.520 --> 24:15.087
Promise me.

24:20.893 --> 24:22.461
Promise.

24:58.397 --> 24:59.599
There he is.

25:01.033 --> 25:03.169
Want to put the
gloves on? Hmm?

25:03.269 --> 25:04.136
Duke it out,

25:04.236 --> 25:05.938
like Dad used to teach us?

25:06.038 --> 25:08.541
Remember? Yeah?

25:12.144 --> 25:15.548
Yeah, I guess
I got Dad's temper.

25:15.648 --> 25:17.216
You got his wandering eye.

25:18.651 --> 25:21.120
I just never thought
it would come wandering

25:21.220 --> 25:24.223
into my marriage, in my house?

25:24.323 --> 25:29.128
Yeah, the house that you
banished your very own son from?

25:30.429 --> 25:32.732
We can both cast
blame here a bit.

25:33.499 --> 25:34.801
Yeah, I'll never forgive
myself for that,

25:34.901 --> 25:36.435
but that's none of
your business.

25:36.535 --> 25:38.404
No, you don't have to forgive
yourself for that because,

25:38.504 --> 25:41.741
apparently, everybody's got
plenty of forgiveness for you.

25:41.841 --> 25:43.409
What?

25:43.509 --> 25:44.944
I don't understand
how this happened.

25:45.044 --> 25:46.445
You're my brother.

25:50.382 --> 25:54.621
Look, Sharon told me
how sick she was,

25:54.721 --> 25:56.522
and I don't know.

25:56.623 --> 25:59.692
I remembered being
in that exact same room,

25:59.792 --> 26:01.193
right after Riley died.

26:01.293 --> 26:04.396
And this family
was broken.

26:04.496 --> 26:08.200
And the thought of losing
Sharon now, that's unthinkable.

26:08.300 --> 26:09.669
So I got emotional.

26:09.769 --> 26:11.503
You know? I let feelings slip...
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

26:11.604 --> 26:14.173
Yeah, she's my wife!
...that I never... I know.

26:14.273 --> 26:17.644
This is my family, man.
I know that.

26:17.744 --> 26:20.512
And I'm no saint, Vin,

26:20.613 --> 26:21.981
but neither are you.

26:22.081 --> 26:23.515
Hmm? But you still get
the family,

26:23.616 --> 26:26.986
you get the wife,
you get the legacy chief job.

26:27.086 --> 26:28.020
And what do I get?

26:28.120 --> 26:29.421
I'm bouncing around Cal Fire

26:29.521 --> 26:31.691
still trying to get
some kind of recognition.

26:34.093 --> 26:37.163
I'm lost, Vin.

26:38.130 --> 26:41.067
Yeah. Yeah. Lone wolf.

26:43.636 --> 26:45.104
Hey, I am sorry.

27:36.388 --> 27:38.224
Smoke.

27:38.324 --> 27:39.458
Yo, is that...

27:39.558 --> 27:41.060
Fire, hey, fire!

27:41.160 --> 27:43.629
Hey! Wake up! Wake up!
Everybody out! Fire!
Get up!

27:43.730 --> 27:44.897
Everybody up!

27:44.997 --> 27:46.833
We got a fire, everybody!

27:46.933 --> 27:49.068
Get up, gear up and move out.
Let's go, let's go!

27:50.536 --> 27:52.471
You know who did this.

27:55.908 --> 27:58.244
Hey, I think I know
where Odin might be.

27:58.344 --> 27:59.645
Yeah, I don't think.
I know.

27:59.746 --> 28:02.514
Three Rock is on fire.
Listen, listen.

28:02.614 --> 28:05.451
Sharon, he might be after Bode,
he might still be after you.

28:05.551 --> 28:07.286
Okay? So I want
you to stay here.

28:07.386 --> 28:09.321
You're not on active duty!

28:09.421 --> 28:11.123
Don't care.

28:11.223 --> 28:12.691
Greencrest,
it's Three Rock Crew Four.

28:12.792 --> 28:14.660
We have
a large area surface fire

28:14.761 --> 28:16.228
with involved structures
at our camp.

28:16.328 --> 28:18.831
This thing is
moving fast, fellas.

28:18.931 --> 28:20.299
Must've started it
with gasoline.

28:20.399 --> 28:21.633
All right, Three Rock, on me.

28:21.734 --> 28:22.735
Bode, go.

28:22.835 --> 28:24.370
Lonnegan, house hoses.

28:24.470 --> 28:27.774
The rest of you, we need
back pumps from the buggy,

28:27.874 --> 28:29.308
we need water buckets
and extinguishers.

28:29.408 --> 28:31.410
We're gonna hit the shed,
we're gonna hit the benches,

28:31.510 --> 28:33.212
everything we can do
to keep this under control.

28:33.312 --> 28:34.446
Do you copy?

28:34.546 --> 28:36.215
Copy.
Let's go!

28:36.315 --> 28:38.717
Water coming.

28:41.888 --> 28:43.890
I got a leak!
Freddy!

28:43.990 --> 28:45.324
Yo, Cap!

28:45.424 --> 28:47.093
Yo!
The hose is cut!

28:48.995 --> 28:50.763
Cuts brake lines
and cuts our hoses?

28:50.863 --> 28:52.031
That just means
we're gonna cut some line.

28:52.131 --> 28:54.166
All right, gentlemen,
Three Rock.

28:54.266 --> 28:56.368
We're gonna cut a highway
around our barracks.

28:56.468 --> 28:58.704
That's a four-foot scrape.
All right? Let's go!

28:58.805 --> 29:00.907
He's out there.

29:01.007 --> 29:02.574
He wants to watch
this whole place

29:02.674 --> 29:04.143
go up in flames.
Don't let him.

29:04.243 --> 29:05.277
Don't take the bait.

29:10.049 --> 29:11.683
Cap, we can't,
we can't just let this dude--

29:11.784 --> 29:13.685
Bode, Bode,
listen to me.

29:13.786 --> 29:15.454
Look, I know
you don't think

29:15.554 --> 29:17.189
you can count on me,
and I get that.

29:17.289 --> 29:19.191
But these guys,

29:19.291 --> 29:22.028
they need to know that
they can count on you, man.

29:26.999 --> 29:29.468
Hey, give me one of those.
There you go.

29:37.509 --> 29:39.879
You worried about Bode?

29:39.979 --> 29:43.049
And my dad, and Freddy,
and everybody.

29:43.149 --> 29:45.051
I guess that's just
the rush I get

29:45.151 --> 29:46.718
from emotionally
rescuing people.

29:46.819 --> 29:48.720
Okay, look, I'm
sorry I said that.

29:48.821 --> 29:49.922
I didn't mean it.

29:50.022 --> 29:53.392
Really?
'Cause it just happened.

29:56.963 --> 29:59.031
Luke and Vince did it.

29:59.131 --> 30:01.433
Look, there's always
something between them,

30:01.533 --> 30:04.236
and it always is
Luke's fault.

30:05.938 --> 30:08.274
Gabs, I don't want
to be that guy.

30:08.374 --> 30:09.775
Resentful,

30:09.876 --> 30:11.777
passive-aggressive...

30:11.878 --> 30:13.880
You know,
and petty ain't cute.

30:13.980 --> 30:17.884
And I got to be cute if
I'm gonna be back on the market.

30:19.485 --> 30:21.787
You're not just cute.

30:21.888 --> 30:23.789
You're kind.

30:23.890 --> 30:26.425
And you're gonna be
one hell of a catch.

30:39.171 --> 30:40.306
1591?

30:40.406 --> 30:41.607
Fire jump the road?

30:41.707 --> 30:43.309
Chief, we got fire
on the road.

30:43.409 --> 30:45.844
There's a tree down.

30:46.678 --> 30:49.315
Could be the blaze.
Could be a trap.

30:49.415 --> 30:52.651
Yeah, but we're gonna
attack it the same, either way.

30:52.751 --> 30:55.087
Manny, how are my boys
doing at Three Rock?

30:55.187 --> 30:58.790
By the skin of our teeth, Chief.

31:00.192 --> 31:02.861
Keep digging that line, fellas.

31:02.962 --> 31:05.231
We're not gonna last long
without any water, Chief.

31:05.331 --> 31:06.732
We're boxed in.

31:25.084 --> 31:26.685
Water's on the way, Manny.

31:26.785 --> 31:28.387
Copy, Chief.

31:28.487 --> 31:31.157
And maybe while Odin's
out there on the loose,

31:31.257 --> 31:33.092
it's not such a bad thing
that Bode's contained.

31:33.192 --> 31:34.593
Copy that.

31:35.527 --> 31:37.964
Great job, guys.
Let's move this tree!

31:38.064 --> 31:40.332
Come on,
Three Rock needs our water!

31:42.334 --> 31:44.203
While it's good to see
you back in action,

31:44.303 --> 31:45.804
I do want you to
take it easy, though.

31:45.904 --> 31:48.174
You still need a kidney.
I need my son more.

31:48.274 --> 31:50.809
I need all my boys
at the camp.

31:52.378 --> 31:54.180
All right, fellas, dig deep.

31:54.280 --> 31:56.949
Not another foot,
not another inch.

31:59.118 --> 32:01.520
Go, go, go!

32:02.221 --> 32:04.090
There's a spot!

32:04.190 --> 32:05.657
Spot fire, right there,
right there.

32:05.757 --> 32:07.960
We got it , Cap.
We've been here before.

32:08.060 --> 32:10.496
That's good hustle!
Good hustle!

32:13.232 --> 32:15.301
Hell yeah!

32:15.401 --> 32:17.269
Make it rain!

32:20.439 --> 32:22.041
All right, we're gonna need
to get a little over here

32:22.141 --> 32:23.542
around Charlie's side.

32:26.912 --> 32:28.647
We did it, boys.

32:28.747 --> 32:30.716
All right, you did it.

32:30.816 --> 32:34.020
You saved Three Rock.
Well done.

32:34.120 --> 32:36.022
Hell of a job
fighting fire

32:36.122 --> 32:38.224
with no resources, Cap.

32:38.324 --> 32:41.160
I had the most invaluable
resources of all--

32:41.260 --> 32:43.495
these Three Rock
firefighters right here.

32:43.595 --> 32:45.998
You did it, boys.

32:50.936 --> 32:53.772
I may have fallen short of
expectations, but these guys,

32:53.872 --> 32:57.676
no, these guys,
they rise to them.

32:57.776 --> 32:59.811
And Bode really held it down.

32:59.911 --> 33:01.513
Where is Bode?

33:21.400 --> 33:24.203
I guess you only cut
women's brakes, huh, you coward?

33:28.674 --> 33:31.910
We'll see who
the coward is, Leone.

33:44.456 --> 33:46.392
I had a family,

33:46.492 --> 33:48.094
a wife and a kid.

33:48.194 --> 33:50.662
After your mom sent me
back to prison,

33:50.762 --> 33:53.699
I never saw them again.

33:53.799 --> 33:57.669
And I always wondered,
does it keep her up at night?

33:57.769 --> 34:01.240
That she ruined my life?

34:01.340 --> 34:04.510
No, not one bit.

34:04.610 --> 34:07.379
And on top of that,

34:07.479 --> 34:09.281
she doesn't even
remember me.

34:09.381 --> 34:11.983
So, yeah, yeah.

34:12.084 --> 34:15.387
I owe her a little bit
of all that pain.

34:15.487 --> 34:17.556
Not gonna happen.

34:25.964 --> 34:28.167
I'm gonna end you, mama's boy.

34:33.805 --> 34:36.675
Bully and a coward, but
you're not much of a fighter.

34:50.356 --> 34:51.890
Ah!

34:57.529 --> 34:59.498
You don't come at my town.

34:59.598 --> 35:02.434
My people. My family.

35:09.575 --> 35:11.443
My mom.

35:11.543 --> 35:12.944
Do it.

35:13.044 --> 35:14.146
Do it!

35:14.246 --> 35:16.248
No, no. B.

35:16.348 --> 35:20.419
Hey, listen, you hit him,
and you become him.

35:20.519 --> 35:22.821
Bode. Hey.

35:22.921 --> 35:25.257
That is exactly
what he wants.

35:25.357 --> 35:28.760
To take away your chance
at the life you deserve.

35:28.860 --> 35:32.063
Swear to God,
don't you let him.

35:33.399 --> 35:35.301
He wants to hurt my mom.

35:36.668 --> 35:37.736
Bode...

35:37.836 --> 35:40.172
We are not gonna let him.

35:40.272 --> 35:43.041
He's not going to hurt
anyone anymore. Just himself.

35:44.142 --> 35:47.045
Bode, come on.
I got you. Come here.

35:47.145 --> 35:49.948
And I do remember
you. I agonized

35:50.048 --> 35:51.350
over kicking you
out of Three Rock,

35:51.450 --> 35:52.651
but you proved
me right.

35:52.751 --> 35:54.753
Then and now.
You see all these men?

35:54.853 --> 35:56.622
They all took
that second chance.

35:56.722 --> 35:58.957
You didn't.
You watch.

35:59.057 --> 36:03.094
She'll flip on all of you,
over one violation.

36:03.195 --> 36:04.963
No, no. Not our
Chief Sharon, bro.

36:05.063 --> 36:06.698
She's got our backs,
and we got hers.

36:06.798 --> 36:08.300
And it wasn't just
one violation,

36:08.400 --> 36:10.436
homie, I was there,
too. Remember me?

36:10.536 --> 36:12.771
Let's go, come on.

36:22.881 --> 36:26.652
I'm sorry.
Broke my promise.

36:26.752 --> 36:28.887
I'm sorry, too.

36:32.758 --> 36:34.159
You all right?

36:52.344 --> 36:56.448
"Beloved retired firefighters
injured in last week's melee."

36:59.785 --> 37:01.520
What, you're not gonna
rev your engine now?

37:01.620 --> 37:03.689
No.

37:03.789 --> 37:05.791
'Cause I'm not the focus
of the attention,

37:05.891 --> 37:08.193
which is just the way I like it.

37:09.795 --> 37:14.132
Well, maybe sometimes being
the focus of attention

37:14.232 --> 37:15.834
brings good karma.

37:17.135 --> 37:18.169
Yeah.

37:18.270 --> 37:21.307
It did bring some things
to light.

37:21.407 --> 37:22.674
Odin...

37:22.774 --> 37:24.510
Luke...

37:24.610 --> 37:27.946
even Bode's... dark side.

37:28.046 --> 37:29.381
Yeah.

37:30.682 --> 37:32.351
I suppose that means me, too.

37:34.586 --> 37:36.121
I'll work on the anger stuff.

37:37.656 --> 37:38.657
Bode's gonna be fine.

37:38.757 --> 37:41.192
So are you.

37:44.796 --> 37:46.898
Results are in today.

37:47.733 --> 37:49.468
And...

37:49.568 --> 37:52.538
this might seem out of
character for you, but I'm...

37:52.638 --> 37:54.573
I think I'm hopeful.

37:56.608 --> 37:58.109
Think my girl's gonna
get a kidney.

37:59.611 --> 38:01.380
Well...

38:01.480 --> 38:02.714
if you play my song,

38:02.814 --> 38:04.516
I think my favorite
lead singer's

38:04.616 --> 38:06.117
gonna get himself a groupie.

38:30.342 --> 38:31.910
You okay?

38:37.048 --> 38:38.817
I let someone down.

38:41.353 --> 38:42.954
Yeah, me, too.

38:48.427 --> 38:49.995
My test results?

38:52.464 --> 38:54.433
Listen, Bode.

38:54.533 --> 38:57.436
Even if you are a match,

38:57.536 --> 38:59.871
it's a long road.

39:07.345 --> 39:09.381
This is, um...

39:10.649 --> 39:13.318
It's a song I wrote for a girl

39:13.419 --> 39:17.255
that I fell in love with
when we were both probies...

39:18.757 --> 39:21.693
And I have not stopped falling
in love with her since.

39:21.793 --> 39:25.497
Some of you might know her
as your division chief,

39:25.597 --> 39:30.168
but she is also
my smoking hot, badass wife.

39:34.172 --> 39:35.941
