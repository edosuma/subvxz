WEBVTT

03:14.896 --> 03:16.596
3:52 p.m.

03:23.938 --> 03:25.672
I brought you somethin'.

03:28.575 --> 03:31.178
I only drink organic juices.

03:31.212 --> 03:34.681
Y'all need to get rid of your sugar
machine and enter the 21st century.

03:35.216 --> 03:37.752
Be sure to bring that up
at the next board meeting.

03:37.785 --> 03:39.053
Why am I in homicide?

03:39.086 --> 03:42.023
I checked your jacket.
You're a stick-up man, not a killer.

03:43.556 --> 03:45.993
And you pullin' all that rippin' and
runnin' out there in the streets.

03:46.861 --> 03:48.595
That's gonna make you
a lot of enemies.

03:48.628 --> 03:51.198
Make sense you feel
the need to be strapped,

03:51.232 --> 03:54.534
but that's gonna open you up to
a major conflict with the law.

03:58.571 --> 04:02.442
That gun they found in your
vehicle had shaved numbers.

04:03.543 --> 04:05.780
That's a mandatory nickel
in a federal joint.

04:06.847 --> 04:09.549
And with your priors,
maybe more.

04:09.582 --> 04:12.519
Depends on how the prosecutor
wanna push it.

04:22.263 --> 04:25.066
They're gonna run that nine
through IBIS.

04:26.767 --> 04:31.471
They're gonna test the ballistics
and check the striations.

04:32.006 --> 04:34.842
And if there's a body
attached to it,

04:36.043 --> 04:38.678
you're goin' away forever
and a day just like that song.

04:39.013 --> 04:42.984
"Forever and a Day. Yeah, man,
that... Heatwave, right?

04:43.683 --> 04:46.287
Man, my mother used to listen
to that on HUR.

04:47.687 --> 04:48.688
So did mine.

04:50.024 --> 04:52.760
Melvin Lindsey used to rock
that on the regular.

04:55.930 --> 04:56.964
Look, man.

04:59.300 --> 05:02.635
You in the murder house, 'cause I figured
we could do each other a couple solids.

05:02.669 --> 05:06.539
You help me put down
an outstandin' homicide or two

05:06.573 --> 05:11.578
and it's possible that that
problem of yours could go away.

05:11.946 --> 05:14.281
I don't know anything
about any murders.

05:14.315 --> 05:16.050
That ain't the world
I drive through.

05:19.053 --> 05:22.655
But something interesting comes
to mind that you might like.

05:23.057 --> 05:24.691
I'm listening.

05:28.329 --> 05:29.696
Turn it off.

05:30.998 --> 05:35.602
- Talk about it.
- Alright.

05:35.970 --> 05:40.908
Some big-time lawyer connected
through his work to the street,

05:40.941 --> 05:44.045
reached out to a man I've been
knowing since we were kids.

05:44.078 --> 05:46.747
My man gave the lawyer my name.

05:47.915 --> 05:52.853
- And?
- What, the lawyer? Some old white dude.

05:52.887 --> 05:55.322
He's got a young wife,
much younger than him.

05:55.356 --> 05:57.158
Heh, his round 2.

05:57.892 --> 06:00.327
Anyway, he's havin' a problem
with his woman.

06:00.361 --> 06:03.831
Kinda problem
he wants solved permanent.

06:04.732 --> 06:07.567
He tried to hire you
to kill his wife?

06:08.035 --> 06:09.804
And that's a bet.

06:09.837 --> 06:14.141
- How much?
- My man say 50,000.

06:15.843 --> 06:17.344
That right there is real money.

06:17.378 --> 06:20.714
Yeah, it is. But that ain't me.

06:21.382 --> 06:24.819
- You tell that to the lawyer?
- Oh, I never spoke to him.

06:24.852 --> 06:26.619
I held on to his number, though.

06:26.653 --> 06:27.922
Why?

06:27.955 --> 06:31.624
In case, I got into a situation
like I'm in today.

06:32.960 --> 06:34.328
You got a name for me?

06:34.361 --> 06:39.166
No, but the number's still in my
phone, the one that got confiscated

06:39.200 --> 06:42.602
when y'all illegally searched
my vehicle this afternoon,

06:43.003 --> 06:45.372
so you can use this though,
right?

06:45.406 --> 06:46.673
Not me.

06:47.908 --> 06:50.177
But, I mean, like, it's good
information like I'm free to go.

06:50.211 --> 06:53.781
Oh, oh, just don't...
Don't get ahead of yourself, Cray.

06:54.415 --> 06:57.017
You're not exactly
out of this situation just yet.

07:05.159 --> 07:06.894
What high school you go to?

07:07.828 --> 07:09.897
The only high school,
HD Woodson.

07:10.831 --> 07:15.402
The only high school.
I went to Cardozo, the Clerks.

07:16.203 --> 07:18.172
The Clerks. Oh, man.

07:19.874 --> 07:22.776
- You somethin'.
- Look, can I get that juice?

07:23.077 --> 07:26.413
Oh, yeah. Organic, right. I'm gonna
run out to Whole Foods right quick.

07:26.447 --> 07:28.681
You just stay right here.
Don't go anywhere.

07:33.454 --> 07:37.725
Back in school
I used to row from out there.

07:37.758 --> 07:39.093
Which one? This dock?

07:39.126 --> 07:41.162
Yeah, up at those red lights.

07:42.463 --> 07:45.698
- You in military?
- Yeah, I served in the Middle East.

07:46.133 --> 07:47.701
How did you get
into this line of work?

07:47.735 --> 07:49.370
I was a SOCOM, special ops.

07:49.403 --> 07:53.207
After that I worked for the Triple Canopy
outfit in Afghanistan personal security.

07:53.240 --> 07:55.442
So this was
a natural progression.

07:55.476 --> 07:57.278
I'm just doin'
what I was trained to do.

08:02.082 --> 08:03.683
So tell me what you need?

08:04.118 --> 08:08.822
My wife is, uh, considerably
younger than I am.

08:09.290 --> 08:14.195
She has been, uh, unfaithful

08:15.262 --> 08:16.931
since the day we met.

08:18.999 --> 08:21.235
I thought she'd change
but, uh,

08:22.836 --> 08:24.305
marrying her
was a mistake.

08:25.973 --> 08:28.008
- Terrible mistake.
- Get a divorce.

08:29.076 --> 08:30.778
Yeah.

08:31.212 --> 08:34.215
My first wife,
she damn near cleaned me out.

08:35.115 --> 08:37.117
Another settlement
would ruin me.

08:38.519 --> 08:41.855
Frankly,
I can't abide the betrayal.

08:43.857 --> 08:46.126
Or the loss of my self-esteem.

08:48.562 --> 08:49.863
I want her to pay.

08:51.899 --> 08:55.269
Say what you want. Exactly.

09:02.276 --> 09:03.310
I want you to kill her.

09:05.846 --> 09:07.781
But you haven't even
told me her name.

09:09.116 --> 09:12.886
- What?
- Her name. What's her name?

09:13.954 --> 09:14.989
It's Gina.

09:17.558 --> 09:19.026
Her name is Gina.

10:29.630 --> 10:34.168
Excuse me, I was wondering if you
knew anything about this book.

10:34.201 --> 10:37.037
If it's any good,
I mean it's for my father.

10:37.071 --> 10:41.608
Um, I'm not familiar with it.
You should ask the person who works here.

10:41.642 --> 10:43.010
Oh.

10:46.647 --> 10:48.115
What do you got there?

10:49.149 --> 10:53.854
It's "Appointment in Samarra"
by John O'Hara.

10:54.221 --> 10:56.023
Some say
he's better than Fitzgerald.

10:56.924 --> 10:58.092
Them's fightin' words.

10:59.293 --> 11:03.397
- Have you read O'Hara?
- No. No, not yet, I'd like to.

11:05.299 --> 11:09.103
It's about a self-destructive
man in a doomed marriage.

11:09.136 --> 11:12.239
Sounds real upbeat.
Me, I like happy endings.

11:15.008 --> 11:16.276
Nice talking with you.

11:17.277 --> 11:18.479
Hey, wait a second.

11:19.680 --> 11:23.884
I never do this, but would
you like to get a cup of coffee?

11:24.284 --> 11:25.486
Lunch or somethin'?

11:26.920 --> 11:30.090
- I can't, but thank you anyway.
- Just lunch. Conversation.

11:30.124 --> 11:31.458
Maybe I'll learn somethin'
about books

11:31.492 --> 11:34.928
and, you know,
the Appointment in the Sahara.

11:37.398 --> 11:41.268
I'm sure this isn't the first time
you've done something like this

11:41.301 --> 11:44.304
and you're very charming,
but I can't.

11:45.172 --> 11:48.475
- You want to though.
- You don't lack confidence.

11:49.309 --> 11:52.012
I'm married.
It would be wrong.

11:53.414 --> 11:55.048
I'll tell you what?

11:56.049 --> 11:58.452
I'm heading up the street
to the Hitching Post.

11:58.485 --> 12:01.488
It's a soul food spot
on second and Upshur.

12:02.189 --> 12:05.692
If you wanna meet me, fine.
I will be there.

12:05.727 --> 12:08.295
- Nice meeting you.
- Bob.

12:19.072 --> 12:20.441
Thank you, darling.

12:20.474 --> 12:23.043
You got it, baby,
I'll be right back to take your order.

13:37.251 --> 13:38.418
Gina!

13:39.620 --> 13:41.255
Gina.

14:20.294 --> 14:21.729
Gina, it's me.

14:21.763 --> 14:24.565
I know I'm supposed to call your
disposable, but you're not pickin' up.

14:25.365 --> 14:28.068
I've been trying to reach you
for days, please hit me back.

14:44.484 --> 14:48.355
- It's been a while.
- I've been busy.

14:48.388 --> 14:51.158
Hmm, too busy for your mentor?

14:51.191 --> 14:54.328
Don't be so sensitive.
I bought you your coffee.

14:54.361 --> 14:55.863
What?
You want a kiss, too?

14:55.897 --> 14:58.365
And a piece of chocolate
for my pillow.

15:01.703 --> 15:04.371
What happened to that tip I gave you?
You never said anythin'.

15:04.906 --> 15:06.106
Which one?

15:06.139 --> 15:09.877
- White dude wanted to off his wife.
- Oh, that... Pasadeno.

15:09.911 --> 15:12.880
No, he died before I had the
opportunity to meet with him.

15:12.914 --> 15:16.650
So you never got to give him that bullshit
story about you being special ops?

15:23.256 --> 15:24.391
What do you mean he died?

15:24.424 --> 15:26.226
You know,
like when you stop bein' alive.

15:26.259 --> 15:27.361
Funny.

15:28.930 --> 15:31.598
Leonard Sanderson
came home one night,

15:31.632 --> 15:34.501
twisted on alcohol,
and fell down his basement stairs.

15:34.534 --> 15:38.338
Broken neck. My man's blood-alcohol
level was off the charts.

15:38.740 --> 15:40.708
M.E. ruled it
an accidental death.

15:42.676 --> 15:45.679
- How the widow take it?
- I don't know, I never met her.

15:57.959 --> 16:01.528
- You sleepin' alright, young man?
- Like a baby.

16:02.262 --> 16:05.933
You don't look like it.
For real, Bobby, you okay?

16:05.967 --> 16:09.503
Yeah, the usual shit, the job,
stuff at home. It's nothin' major.

16:09.536 --> 16:13.340
- Don't lie to your daddy.
- I'm fine.

17:04.759 --> 17:08.562
<i>The number you're trying
to reach is no longer in service. Goodbye.</i>

17:35.056 --> 17:38.291
You're sayin' that
Sanderson's hyoid was broke?

17:38.793 --> 17:40.660
According to the report, yes.

17:49.070 --> 17:51.404
He fell down a flight of stairs,
Gwen.

17:51.438 --> 17:53.640
How common
is a hyoid fracture in a fall?

17:53.673 --> 17:58.713
Not very. Strangulation,
hanging, blunt-force trauma,

17:58.746 --> 18:01.481
that breaks the hyoid,
not a fall.

18:01.816 --> 18:03.718
So why was it ruled an accident?

18:03.751 --> 18:09.356
Wasn't my lookout, but, you know,
things do slip through the cracks.

18:09.724 --> 18:12.325
You wanna reanimate
a closed case?

18:12.692 --> 18:14.729
Me? Heh, no.

18:18.099 --> 18:21.803
You owe me for this
and I don't mean coffee.

18:22.837 --> 18:24.437
Dinner.

18:25.438 --> 18:27.340
How about Crisfield's?

18:27.775 --> 18:30.077
I've been dreaming
about their crab imperial.

18:30.111 --> 18:31.678
Now you're trying to spoil me.

18:37.718 --> 18:41.488
What's up with you, Mitch?
You look like your dog died.

18:42.689 --> 18:45.827
I got a conundrum. I don't know
what to do about it.

18:46.493 --> 18:47.929
Care to run it by me?

18:51.398 --> 18:55.803
No. No, it's somethin'
I gotta figure out alone.

18:58.139 --> 18:59.472
Okay.

19:08.381 --> 19:10.918
Alright, okay. Come on, you guys.
Let's find something to watch on TV.

19:10.952 --> 19:14.621
Hold on.
Who knows where the remote is?

19:15.957 --> 19:17.490
I'll help you find it.

19:17.524 --> 19:18.960
Oh, yeah, you will.

19:20.194 --> 19:21.796
Mom!

19:51.591 --> 19:55.462
<i>Hi, you've reached Gina, I'm not
here right now. Please leave a message.</i>

19:56.764 --> 19:58.933
<i>Gina, it's Bobby.
If you're there, pick up.</i>

19:59.934 --> 20:01.869
<i>Can you, um,
can you pick up the phone?</i>

20:01.903 --> 20:04.772
<i>I just need to speak
with you for a second.</i>

20:04.805 --> 20:07.440
<i>Gina, it's Bobby. If you're...
if you're there, pick up.</i>

20:11.846 --> 20:13.981
<i>I need to speak with you, okay?</i>

20:14.982 --> 20:19.186
<i>Just, um...
Please pick up the phone, okay?</i>

20:19.220 --> 20:21.956
<i>Uh, just, just call me back
and, uh...</i>

20:22.689 --> 20:25.793
<i>And I'll talk to you soon, I'll be able
to have my phone all day.</i>

20:37.872 --> 20:40.841
<i>My name is Tonio Harris.</i>

20:41.641 --> 20:44.979
<i>This place where I come up,
it can be kinda rough.</i>

20:46.247 --> 20:50.550
<i>I got problems at home.
Got problems at school.</i>

20:50.952 --> 20:53.988
<i>Hell, I got problems walkin'
down these here streets.</i>

20:55.522 --> 20:59.659
<i>And if you wanna know the truth,
I got problems with my future.</i>

21:05.733 --> 21:07.702
Now, come on.
Now, come on.

21:08.601 --> 21:11.038
- Yeah, yeah.
- Oh, squeeze.

21:11.072 --> 21:14.709
Go for it, Antwan. It was close.
Hey, let me set that, nigga.

21:14.742 --> 21:16.711
- I got it, James bro.
- You don't got him, I got him.

21:16.744 --> 21:17.979
I got him. What's up?

21:20.014 --> 21:21.015
Come on.

21:22.950 --> 21:26.721
Come on, yeah, I got him.
So what's up with you?

21:26.754 --> 21:27.822
Here we go, here we go.

21:27.855 --> 21:30.590
He's about to take you.

21:30.623 --> 21:33.894
- Oh, shit.
- Watch the pick. Watch the pick. Watch it.

21:36.831 --> 21:40.801
- Yay!
- Yay!

21:48.843 --> 21:50.745
Oh, Payless Shoe-wearin' ass,
nigga.

21:52.046 --> 21:53.748
Are we gonna ball or what?

21:55.916 --> 21:57.852
No, we can go instead, though.

22:00.721 --> 22:02.622
Come on, man,
let's run it, y'all.

22:08.661 --> 22:09.930
Hey, slim, I gotta go.

22:11.198 --> 22:14.835
Alright, tell your little sister
that I said, what's up, alright?

22:14.869 --> 22:17.772
Shorty got some nice little titties on
her, you know what I'm sayin'?

22:23.377 --> 22:24.912
Take your ball and go home,
slim.

22:27.748 --> 22:29.150
I see you later, Tonio.

22:29.817 --> 22:31.551
Yo bama ass.

22:35.356 --> 22:38.793
We gonna holler at you
and we gonna see you.

22:52.840 --> 22:56.143
I be seein' that boy around.
He got them nothin' eyes.

22:56.177 --> 22:57.677
Maybe you shouldn't
have schooled him.

22:58.045 --> 23:02.615
Uh, you know, that's just
who I am. This your car?

23:02.649 --> 23:04.819
My father's.
He can't drive no more.

23:06.387 --> 23:07.922
You go to that restaurant
like I told you to?

23:08.823 --> 23:10.124
Yeah, I went.

23:10.858 --> 23:12.860
White boy who interviewed me
was like,

23:12.893 --> 23:14.829
"Do you understand
that the hours are long

23:14.862 --> 23:17.798
and do you think you're gonna
make it to work on time?"

23:17.832 --> 23:20.701
He might as well have gone ahead
and called me a nigger to my face,

23:20.734 --> 23:22.303
'cause then he sat there,

23:22.336 --> 23:25.005
and smiled like he was gonna make a big
announcement or some type of lesson.

23:25.039 --> 23:27.374
Oh, I think,
we'll give you a try.

23:27.408 --> 23:29.977
So I told him, "I don't wanna
work at the joint."

23:30.010 --> 23:32.113
I walked right out of the joint
with my head up high.

23:33.013 --> 23:36.117
You should have taken that job
and showed him he was wrong.

23:36.150 --> 23:39.820
Yo, I can't stand the way white
people be talkin' to me sometimes.

23:39.854 --> 23:42.790
It's like, they only there
to make theyselves feel better.

23:42.823 --> 23:44.925
Like, "Oh, I hired a Negro",
and all that shit.

23:44.959 --> 23:48.395
Well, you gotta do somethin'.
Not tryin' to tell you what to do.

23:48.429 --> 23:50.697
I just don't want you to make
the same mistakes I've made.

23:52.433 --> 23:54.969
Uh, alright, I'mma find a job.

23:56.437 --> 23:59.840
Well, let's get out of here.
I told your mother I see you got home.

23:59.874 --> 24:01.775
Crack that window, too.

24:09.917 --> 24:11.952
<i>My name is Peters.</i>

24:11.986 --> 24:16.157
<i>The younger officers in the Fourth
District call me Sergeant dad.</i>

24:16.190 --> 24:19.093
<i>I don't mind as long as
they say it with respect.</i>

24:20.261 --> 24:24.765
<i>I ride midnights mostly.
I prefer to ride alone.</i>

24:25.065 --> 24:29.970
<i>You get aches and pains when you're
behind the wheel for hours at a stretch.</i>

24:30.938 --> 24:35.109
<i>I should get one of those things
the African cabbies sit on.</i>

24:35.142 --> 24:37.711
<i>Looks like a rack
of wooden balls.</i>

24:38.245 --> 24:41.916
<i>I've been doing this
for 22 years now.</i>

24:41.949 --> 24:48.022
<i>Well, I guess the damage I've done
to my spine or whatever is permanent.</i>

24:49.957 --> 24:54.128
Hey.
Pretty late for her to be out.

24:54.161 --> 24:56.063
It was just hot in my apartment,
we're just getting some air.

24:56.096 --> 25:00.701
Yeah. Been some armed
robberies on this block.

25:01.068 --> 25:02.736
I know,
we won't be out too long.

25:02.770 --> 25:03.804
Okay.

25:19.520 --> 25:22.289
Smile for Officer Friendly.

25:32.866 --> 25:34.301
Where you off to?

25:34.335 --> 25:36.237
Backyard's got a show
at the Hall tonight.

25:36.270 --> 25:38.072
So you weren't even gonna ask me
if you could go?

25:38.872 --> 25:40.074
Do I have to?

25:40.107 --> 25:41.508
as
long you're livin' in my house

25:41.542 --> 25:43.510
and you ain't payin'rent,
yes, you have to.

25:43.544 --> 25:46.146
What you talkin' about,
"Do you have to"?

25:46.180 --> 25:47.281
Can I go?

25:50.251 --> 25:51.318
Yes.

25:52.553 --> 25:55.923
- Just get home early, okay?
- Okay.

25:55.956 --> 25:57.524
Look, you know what, um?

25:57.558 --> 26:00.327
I want you to take that
test again, that college test.

26:01.929 --> 26:03.163
Alright, I will.

26:03.197 --> 26:07.001
They got all types of financial
aid for people like you.

26:07.034 --> 26:09.103
You go to school, talk to one
of those counselors, okay?

26:09.136 --> 26:11.071
Yeah, as soon as I find one.

26:14.208 --> 26:16.877
I put somethin' in the bowl
for you.

26:16.910 --> 26:18.345
Alright, ma, thank you.

26:21.915 --> 26:24.852
So your wife
doesn't wanna press charges.

26:24.885 --> 26:26.287
Don't make no difference to me.

26:26.320 --> 26:29.356
Oh, but you got a
restraining order, Charles.

26:29.390 --> 26:33.927
That's my house, too.
Why can't I visit with my sons?

26:35.596 --> 26:38.365
All due respect, they don't look
too happy to see you.

26:41.101 --> 26:42.870
They'll come around.

26:48.108 --> 26:50.377
I don't wanna see you
again tonight.

26:51.111 --> 26:52.946
The feeling's mutual.

27:00.154 --> 27:06.593
- I miss you at the meetings.
- They say the same shit all the time.

27:06.627 --> 27:10.864
- But it works if you work it.
- That's what I'm talkin' about.

27:20.307 --> 27:21.642
You go ahead now.

27:29.149 --> 27:30.351
Okay.

27:52.139 --> 27:53.273
Hey.

27:55.075 --> 27:56.377
Tonio, right?

27:57.444 --> 28:00.881
- How're you doing tonight?
- Maintainin'.

28:02.216 --> 28:04.017
You going to that concert
over there?

28:05.953 --> 28:06.855
Yeah.

28:06.887 --> 28:09.056
Oh, well,
take care of yourself in there

28:09.089 --> 28:11.425
and tell your mom
Sergeant Peters says hello.

28:23.437 --> 28:26.507
<i>I've been knowin' the
people down here for generations.</i>

28:27.174 --> 28:31.412
<i>Locked up that kid's mother years
ago when she was a teenager.</i>

28:31.445 --> 28:34.681
<i>Darla Harris, that's her name.</i>

28:34.716 --> 28:39.319
<i>She was ridin' on</i> The Love Boat <i>back
when that shit was makin' everyone crazy.</i>

28:39.353 --> 28:41.155
<i>She's straight now.</i>

28:41.455 --> 28:45.058
<i>Done a good job with her son
as far as I can tell.</i>

29:45.519 --> 29:50.090
Followin' up on a lead. The deceased
was with that crew over on Kennedy.

29:50.123 --> 29:53.460
There's one street
that'll never gentrify. You?

29:53.494 --> 29:55.763
I was just keepin' an eye
on the critters.

29:55.797 --> 29:59.566
There's a show down
at the Music Hall tonight.

29:59.600 --> 30:02.102
They gotta shut down
those go-go concerts.

30:02.135 --> 30:05.506
Kids and music.
They're just burnin' off energy.

30:05.539 --> 30:11.245
You know, my father used to go down to those
record hops down at the Silver Spring Armory.

30:11.278 --> 30:14.381
The old-timers
then used to say the same thing.

30:18.519 --> 30:21.188
Rock 'n' Roll incites violence.

30:21.221 --> 30:25.225
- Your dad didn't carry a gun.
- Well, carried a knife.

30:26.493 --> 30:28.830
Alright,
I gotta get out of here.

30:28.863 --> 30:32.366
There's some MPD moonlighting
as security at the Music Hall.

30:32.399 --> 30:34.234
I gotta see
if they need assistance.

30:34.268 --> 30:37.170
- Be safe, Sarge.
- You, too.

33:44.524 --> 33:46.761
Look at you.
Tryin' to act hard and shit.

33:48.462 --> 33:52.499
You fucked with me twice today.
You know that, right?

33:53.034 --> 33:55.669
You know, it was my little broad
you was with at the club, right?

33:55.703 --> 33:57.504
No, look, man, I didn't
even know she was with you.

33:57.537 --> 34:01.274
She didn't know either.
But if I say she mine, she mine.

34:01.308 --> 34:03.310
- Look, man...
- Shut the fuck up.

34:04.311 --> 34:06.346
I didn't say you could speak.

34:06.646 --> 34:09.516
Antwan, let me get that.

34:19.060 --> 34:20.795
No, no, no, no, be cool.
Like you was before.

34:22.662 --> 34:24.031
You know what it is,
little nigger?

34:38.678 --> 34:40.413
What are you guys
doin' out here?

34:40.748 --> 34:43.283
We just having
a little conversation, is all.

34:44.786 --> 34:49.689
Something funny?
You don't live here.

34:50.423 --> 34:51.726
You're trespassing.

34:53.094 --> 34:54.594
I ain't trespassing.

35:03.104 --> 35:04.906
- What's your name?
- Huh?

35:05.639 --> 35:08.075
- Your name.
- My name Tonio Harris.

35:08.109 --> 35:09.844
I stay in these apartments.

35:11.578 --> 35:14.816
Then go home. Now.

35:26.393 --> 35:27.862
What's your malfunction?

35:31.698 --> 35:35.502
I don't wanna see you
here again. You understand?

36:59.220 --> 37:00.788
<i>On my next day shift,</i>

37:00.821 --> 37:05.458
<i>I think I'll swing over to Tonio Harris'
apartment and talk to his mother.</i>

37:05.860 --> 37:07.694
<i>See how she's doin'.</i>

37:07.995 --> 37:10.965
<i>Suggest to her without
telling her that maybe...</i>

37:11.698 --> 37:15.202
<i>maybe she oughta have her son
stay inside the next few weeks,</i>

37:15.236 --> 37:19.506
<i>so that beef he has
or whatever it is blows over.</i>

37:20.041 --> 37:24.979
<i>Of course, those kinds of beefs
never do really go away.</i>

37:25.578 --> 37:28.548
<i>But I'll make her aware of it
just the same.</i>

37:28.581 --> 37:29.984
<i>It's not my job to raise kids,</i>

37:30.017 --> 37:33.955
<i>I'm just lettin' these people
know I'm out here. Watchin' them.</i>

37:33.988 --> 37:35.957
<i>I mean, what else can I do?</i>

37:37.590 --> 37:39.626
<i>My back hurts.</i>

37:59.780 --> 38:01.716
Shit.

38:03.751 --> 38:04.617
Hey.

38:11.558 --> 38:15.096
It don't work.
She changed the lock.

38:20.334 --> 38:22.837
Maybe you should sleep somewhere
else tonight.

38:24.671 --> 38:25.773
It's my house.

38:28.042 --> 38:31.712
- What's your name?
- Nesto.

38:32.880 --> 38:34.849
Have a driver's license, Nesto?

38:41.922 --> 38:43.523
You have an ID?

39:02.675 --> 39:04.912
- This is not your house.
- <i>Que?</i>

39:04.945 --> 39:08.082
You're at the wrong house.
It's two doors down.

39:10.951 --> 39:12.720
- I'm sorry.
- Um.

39:17.925 --> 39:20.061
Son, don't forget your keys.

39:23.964 --> 39:24.965
Alright.

39:41.382 --> 39:45.886
<i>We were runnin' now.
The game was full on. And it was fierce.</i>

39:46.686 --> 39:50.623
<i>I wasn't thinkin' about Wallace
or how hard my mother had to work</i>

39:50.657 --> 39:53.160
<i>or which boy was lookin'
to fuck my baby sister.</i>

39:53.861 --> 39:57.131
<i>I wasn't thinkin' on a job
or college or nothin' like that.</i>

39:58.065 --> 40:01.936
- String music, baby.
- Y'all got this. Stay with us, nigga.

40:07.007 --> 40:13.047
Game ain't over yet.
Get that.

40:23.157 --> 40:25.860
<i>It was damn near a perfect day.</i>

40:25.893 --> 40:29.897
<i>Out there in the sunshine,
runnin' ball the way I do,</i>

40:29.930 --> 40:34.201
<i>thinkin' that if I just kept
runnin' that black Maxima,</i>

40:35.102 --> 40:40.174
<i>Wallace, and everything wrong
would just go away.</i>

40:56.457 --> 40:57.925
Alright, let's go again.

40:57.958 --> 41:01.929
Uh, I'm tired of crushin' you.
You look like you're about to cry.

41:02.463 --> 41:03.998
Alright, what you
wanna do then?

41:04.465 --> 41:06.233
Uh,
let's watch that Yeti joint.

41:18.078 --> 41:20.814
Oh, look at that
big-ass snowman!

41:20.848 --> 41:23.050
Oh, how'd you like to come up
on him in the woods?

41:23.083 --> 41:26.053
I hate to break it to you,
but that is a man in a costume.

41:26.086 --> 41:28.155
Uh-uh, sasquatch is real, ma.

41:28.189 --> 41:31.125
Government tryin' to cover that shit
up, like they do with extraterrestrials.

41:31.158 --> 41:32.526
Please.

41:32.560 --> 41:37.998
My mom says there's no such thing as an
ET, Sleepy. No UFOs either.

41:38.032 --> 41:39.466
You workin' tonight, Pat?

41:39.500 --> 41:42.836
No, tomorrow night, the hardware
store's runnin' a sale.

41:42.870 --> 41:45.940
- What about you, Tim?
- No, I quit the restaurant.

41:45.973 --> 41:47.841
Greek wasn't givin' me no hours.

41:48.943 --> 41:51.212
Oh, I'm about to go
to culinary school, though.

41:51.879 --> 41:55.115
- About to.
- Yo, I'm pacin' myself, Miss Mary.

43:30.611 --> 43:32.046
- Hey.
- Hey, what up, yo?

43:32.079 --> 43:33.580
What's up, man?

43:48.962 --> 43:50.397
That's y'all, man.

43:51.131 --> 43:54.601
- We good for it, Rollo.
- I know you is, son.

43:54.635 --> 43:58.105
Hey, you know a David Butler?
They call him Dave.

43:58.439 --> 44:02.209
Man, he got dreads. Gold-toothed,
tryin' to be like Lil Wayne and shit.

44:02.242 --> 44:05.279
We went to the same high school,
we wasn't tight or nothin'.

44:05.312 --> 44:09.116
Alright, well, look.
I gotta bust a swerve at his crib for real

44:09.149 --> 44:13.987
and, um, I don't really know him like
that, so I figured y'all would tag along.

44:14.021 --> 44:15.956
I was goin' to the Summit anyway
to see my girl.

44:15.989 --> 44:18.959
- The Spanish twist?
- She Nicaraguan.

44:18.992 --> 44:22.629
- Man, all that shit is pink.
- Yo, her name is Lucy.

44:22.663 --> 44:25.065
Ugh. Okay, Sleepy, relax.

44:25.099 --> 44:27.401
Aw, David Butler played
football, didn't he?

44:28.135 --> 44:29.436
He tried.

44:33.207 --> 44:35.209
Hey, why y'all ain't play football?
You look like you could've.

44:35.943 --> 44:37.244
Oh, we played.

44:40.114 --> 44:43.450
- Pee-Wee.
- We got to high school. Pat didn't have the grades.

44:43.484 --> 44:48.222
I see no Cs on your report card,
acting like you Alfred Einstein.

44:48.255 --> 44:50.457
I won't gonna play without you.
You're my mans.

44:54.094 --> 44:57.965
Y'all niggas gay.
Anyway y'all rollin'?

44:59.199 --> 45:00.735
Yeah, sure.

45:00.769 --> 45:06.240
Alright, I can... I could take you by
your lil' señorita's on her way, right?

45:30.197 --> 45:31.999
Alright, let's go.

45:40.207 --> 45:44.478
Alright. Alright, little man,
catch up with you later.

46:10.304 --> 46:12.539
- Who is it?
- It's FedEx, man.

46:24.518 --> 46:28.222
My great-great-grandfather
told me Billie Holiday had a fat ass.

46:28.255 --> 46:30.090
Yo, let's do this.

46:31.592 --> 46:33.527
Why you so pressed?

46:33.560 --> 46:36.263
My mother 'bout to be here
from her job.

46:38.265 --> 46:40.501
Look at this little shit,
this is your ma's place, yo?

46:41.268 --> 46:44.104
- You got it.
- You got the kermit?

46:44.137 --> 46:48.375
- I'm good.
- Alright, then. I got it.

46:53.080 --> 46:54.281
Feel light.

46:57.417 --> 46:58.585
You think so?

47:10.464 --> 47:12.499
- Good funk.
- Yeah, I know.

47:13.433 --> 47:15.102
But light.

47:17.571 --> 47:20.541
Man, what you wanna negotiate
or somethin'?

47:20.574 --> 47:22.342
Go back and get my scale
if you want me to?

47:22.376 --> 47:24.611
Yeah, with your superpowers
and all, man,

47:24.645 --> 47:27.247
I figured you can go and weigh
the shit with your hands.

47:28.148 --> 47:31.451
- I'm saying.
- I'm sayin'. It's a LB, man.

47:31.485 --> 47:35.289
- I weighed that shit myself.
- I don't think so.

47:36.657 --> 47:37.691
So I'm lyin'?

47:37.725 --> 47:40.327
We just have a difference
of opinion, that's all.

47:40.360 --> 47:42.162
Maybe we can meet each other
halfway.

47:42.195 --> 47:47.134
So in other words you, uh,
you want a discount.

47:49.971 --> 47:53.340
Nah, you know what, man?
I'll let you set the price.

47:54.909 --> 47:58.278
- Look, we could talk about it.
- No, no, no, you know what?

47:58.312 --> 48:01.648
Just... Just pay me
what you think is right.

48:17.364 --> 48:18.465
That's fair, right?

48:25.238 --> 48:27.541
- Sleepy, get the money.
- Oh.

48:27.574 --> 48:30.477
- Oh.
- Get the fuckin' money, Sleepy!

48:30.510 --> 48:33.280
- All of it.
- Yeah.

48:33.313 --> 48:35.883
Now,
you're gonna take all that, too?

48:35.917 --> 48:37.651
You ain't gonna leave me
with nothin'?

48:38.352 --> 48:40.220
Gonna leave you
with your fuckin' life.

48:50.364 --> 48:53.634
- Hey, why'd you do that?
- 'Cause that niggas a bitch.

48:53.667 --> 48:54.869
He aggravates
the shit out of me.

48:54.902 --> 48:57.437
- What if it gets back around?
- Dave? He's a bitch!

48:57.471 --> 48:58.639
He ain't gonna say shit, man.

48:59.373 --> 49:01.208
I wanna report a robbery.

49:02.944 --> 49:06.413
She was lickin' my balls and
suckin' my dick at the same time.

49:06.446 --> 49:08.916
- Shut the fuck up.
- Yeah.

49:08.950 --> 49:10.517
I swear, bro.

49:12.552 --> 49:13.687
What the fuck.

49:14.421 --> 49:17.524
- Oh, my fucking God.
- Dude, it's us?

49:17.557 --> 49:21.628
- What the fuck.
- Fuck. Yo, what the fuck?

49:21.662 --> 49:24.531
Yo, we got a fuck
ton of weed back here...

49:24.564 --> 49:27.334
So what the fuck
we're gonna do with it?

49:27.367 --> 49:29.536
Don't worry about the
fuckin' strap. Man, I've got that.

49:30.270 --> 49:31.672
Shit.

49:31.706 --> 49:35.409
What are we gonna do with that?
Oh, come on.

49:35.442 --> 49:38.946
Oh, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit.

49:38.980 --> 49:42.549
Put your
hands where I can see them. Now!

49:48.990 --> 49:50.457
Mom.

49:52.492 --> 49:55.529
Alright, so we got you
out. Now, the work begins.

49:55.562 --> 49:59.967
I need you to grow your hair out first of
all, it's a little too severe for court.

50:00.001 --> 50:03.470
And, mom, he's gonna need a blue
suit for when we do go into court

50:03.503 --> 50:04.972
- and go before the judge.
- Okay.

50:05.006 --> 50:07.775
But above all, I just want you
all to remember I've got this.

50:07.809 --> 50:10.377
I don't want you to worry.
Stay in touch.

50:10.410 --> 50:11.979
We're gonna take care of this,
I promise.

50:12.013 --> 50:13.613
- Okay.
- Thank you very much.

50:13.647 --> 50:14.749
- My pleasure.
- I'll be in touch with you.

50:14.782 --> 50:16.349
Okay.

50:27.661 --> 50:29.563
How could you, Pat?

50:31.733 --> 50:33.801
You and Tim,
you know better than this.

50:36.636 --> 50:41.374
Okay. Marijuana, I get that.

50:42.542 --> 50:45.479
- But armed robbery...
- I didn't touch that, nine, though.

50:45.512 --> 50:48.015
I didn't even know it was gonna
go down like it did.

50:48.049 --> 50:52.820
Well, that doesn't matter.
You've been charged with a felony.

50:55.388 --> 50:58.625
It's an automatic five-year
sentence if you're convicted.

50:58.658 --> 51:00.828
Yeah, I know it. I know.

51:03.563 --> 51:04.766
Okay.

51:06.701 --> 51:12.840
Mr Bronson says that you have to cut
off contact with Tim for a while,

51:14.075 --> 51:19.412
you gotta keep your job,
you gotta grow your hair.

51:20.815 --> 51:23.350
Dress right, not look so hard.

51:24.852 --> 51:26.854
'Cause it's gonna help you
when you go to court.

51:26.888 --> 51:28.288
Yeah, I heard him.

51:32.827 --> 51:35.163
How can you afford a high-priced
lawyer like Bronson?

51:39.432 --> 51:42.335
I'll get a second mortgage or
somethin', I'll figure it out.

51:46.439 --> 51:49.509
The important thing's
to keep you out of prison.

51:59.854 --> 52:02.489
- I'm sorry, Mom.
- I know, baby.

52:25.947 --> 52:26.914
Sleepy.

52:28.082 --> 52:31.618
- Why you not answerin' your phone?
- I got a new one.

52:31.651 --> 52:34.454
What? What like a new number
or somethin'?

52:34.487 --> 52:38.592
Yeah. I'll text it to you,
don't give it out.

52:38.625 --> 52:39.760
Yeah, I won't.

52:41.162 --> 52:43.898
You know, my lawyer said I shouldn't
be talking to you for a while,

52:43.931 --> 52:45.498
especially on the cell.

52:45.532 --> 52:48.703
Police could be tappin'
our phones. You got an attorney?

52:49.770 --> 52:53.941
Public defender. Shit, he ain't that
much older than you and me, though.

52:56.509 --> 52:58.511
Hey, man, you ain't gave no
statement to the feds, did you?

52:59.479 --> 53:00.580
No, I didn't say shit.

53:02.183 --> 53:03.550
They offer you a deal?

53:04.551 --> 53:06.888
I wouldn't flip on you, Tim.
You know this.

53:08.789 --> 53:11.591
- Pat, who you talkin' to?
- I gotta go.

53:30.543 --> 53:34.782
Yeah. This for me rude
boys back home, man.

53:34.815 --> 53:37.651
They're dependin' on me more
than my boys in the city is.

53:37.684 --> 53:41.722
- So what you sayin'?
- What I'm saying is I need money.

53:43.224 --> 53:46.193
My lawyer's costin' me big.
I've got a grind just to pay these bills.

53:46.227 --> 53:47.895
You can't be sellin' weed
right now.

53:47.929 --> 53:50.998
No, I can't be sellin' weed
if I'm incarcerated.

53:52.565 --> 53:55.468
I'm lookin' at long time
with my priors?

53:57.872 --> 54:00.007
I'm lookin' at long time, man,
much longer than yo ass.

54:00.908 --> 54:04.211
Yeah, maybe we'd walk if Dave
don't show up to testify.

54:04.245 --> 54:10.785
Yeah, I know, I'm workin' on it. But what really
got me stressed out though is your boy Pat.

54:11.852 --> 54:16.489
If he talks for a reduced
sentence or for probation?

54:16.523 --> 54:18.793
- No, he won't.
- I'm sayin', man.

54:19.260 --> 54:22.562
I'm sayin' if he testifies
to keep his self out the joint...

54:22.595 --> 54:25.032
He wouldn't.
Pat goin' stand tall.

54:25.066 --> 54:27.768
He told you that?
'Cause you talked to him, huh?

54:27.802 --> 54:32.572
'Cause I called him on his phone
and he didn't bother call me back.

54:32.873 --> 54:34.075
That's his old number.

54:35.575 --> 54:38.545
- You got his new one?
- Yeah. I'll call him.

54:39.981 --> 54:43.284
Look, man, I'm just tryin'
to keep us out of prison, man.

54:43.317 --> 54:45.618
I'm lookin' out
for the both of us.

54:48.022 --> 54:49.622
Both of us.

54:50.623 --> 54:54.929
I'm losing sleep over this.
That's not good.

54:55.662 --> 54:56.897
No, I'll talk to Pat.

54:56.931 --> 55:02.635
- Uh, make sure you see to that.
- Don't worry. Pat's straight.

55:33.934 --> 55:37.738
Hey,
this has your name all over it.

55:38.973 --> 55:42.109
What?
You know somebody up in there?

55:44.345 --> 55:45.713
Nah.

56:15.943 --> 56:18.879
<i>This user has
not set up a voicemail message.</i>

56:33.861 --> 56:39.100
- Hey, what are you doin' tonight?
- Working 'til close.

56:39.133 --> 56:43.670
- No, I meant after?
- Comin' home.

56:45.172 --> 56:48.641
You're doing great, Pat.
Keep it up.

57:31.886 --> 57:33.154
Hey, Pat.

57:34.755 --> 57:36.924
Rollo. Tim.

57:37.725 --> 57:40.227
- That's my man, Joe.
- Joe.

57:42.263 --> 57:44.899
- What's going on, Sleepy?
- Waitin' on you, cuz.

57:44.932 --> 57:46.834
Thought we get our heads up.

57:47.201 --> 57:52.072
Uh, you know, I want to, but court's
got me pissin' in a cup once a week.

57:52.106 --> 57:53.707
I can't be droppin' no positive.

57:53.741 --> 57:58.212
I got some shit to fix that. All you got
to do is drink it, clear you right up.

58:00.848 --> 58:03.784
- I better not.
- Come on, man.

58:03.817 --> 58:07.721
Come and visit. Get in the car.
I'll take you to your mama's house.

58:22.803 --> 58:24.838
- Workin' man, huh?
- Yeah, you know how it is.

58:25.239 --> 58:26.207
Nah, not really.

58:29.510 --> 58:32.713
Hey, so, uh, Pat, man,
you got anything you need to tell us?

58:34.248 --> 58:37.017
Man, my lawyer said
not to talk about the case.

58:38.519 --> 58:42.890
- Oh, smart. I get that.
- Yeah, I'mma listen to my lawyer.

58:45.092 --> 58:50.097
You definitely should, but I'm
just askin' like have you heard anything?

58:50.831 --> 58:52.900
Like what's our chances,
what we lookin' like, man?

58:55.169 --> 58:56.804
I know what you know.

59:04.044 --> 59:05.980
I thought y'all had some pieces?

59:06.013 --> 59:08.215
Oh, I got some tree
that'll make y'all trip.

59:08.949 --> 59:10.884
We ain't smokin'
in my car, though.

59:10.918 --> 59:14.288
We gonna go to the school,
we gonna burn it down over there,

59:14.321 --> 59:16.156
and then I'mma take you home,
alright?

59:16.190 --> 59:19.026
- Well, I can't be out late.
- Oh, we got you, Pat.

59:19.893 --> 59:21.061
We got you, man.

59:30.571 --> 59:33.941
- What's up with you, slim?
- Nothin'.

59:35.309 --> 59:37.945
Oh, I haven't had my head up
in a while, that's all.

59:39.079 --> 59:42.816
- I was thinkin' about somethin'.
- Thinkin' about what?

59:45.319 --> 59:47.054
This is where me and Tim
went to school.

59:48.188 --> 59:50.057
They got an auditorium in there.

59:51.859 --> 59:55.296
Tim, you remember
when we got up on stage

59:55.329 --> 59:58.132
and sang and danced
that old Kris Kross song?

59:59.600 --> 1:00:03.804
- That jump, jump, joint?
- I remember.

1:00:08.208 --> 1:00:09.376
We was kids.

1:00:14.615 --> 1:00:17.084
Man, double tap that
motherfucker and let's go.

1:00:59.660 --> 1:01:03.430
Man, I feel for you.
Yeah, I know. I know, man.

1:01:25.018 --> 1:01:26.253
Sleepy?

1:01:31.191 --> 1:01:32.192
Miss Mary.

1:01:52.179 --> 1:01:54.047
Do you know who did this?

1:01:55.315 --> 1:01:58.185
No, ma'am, but I'll find out.

1:01:58.218 --> 1:02:01.054
No, that's not what I'm asking.

1:02:01.388 --> 1:02:06.326
- I want you to promise me something.
- Okay.

1:02:07.528 --> 1:02:10.697
I don't wanna
do retribution for this.

1:02:10.732 --> 1:02:16.036
I don't want you or any of your
friends to murder someone over this

1:02:16.069 --> 1:02:17.404
and go to prison for it.

1:02:18.272 --> 1:02:21.508
I don't want
another young man to die.

1:02:23.076 --> 1:02:27.114
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, ma'am.

1:02:27.147 --> 1:02:32.386
- You promise me?
- I do.

1:02:33.120 --> 1:02:34.221
Okay.

1:02:38.760 --> 1:02:41.528
Okay. Thank you.

1:03:12.259 --> 1:03:17.231
There was police at the funeral home.
They was watchin' me.

1:03:17.264 --> 1:03:20.400
Man, they always doin' that
shit, man. They got nothing.

1:03:20.434 --> 1:03:23.237
Joe is a professional hitter,
man.

1:03:23.270 --> 1:03:29.276
Ditched the weapon, ditched town,
no gun, no witnesses, no case.

1:03:30.244 --> 1:03:32.279
Oh, and Dave?

1:03:33.413 --> 1:03:39.486
He, um, he recanted, so, uh,
all the big shit's gonna be dropped.

1:03:39.520 --> 1:03:43.056
I might do a little bit of time for
violating my parole, blah, blah.

1:03:43.090 --> 1:03:47.461
You might get probation
for possession for intent,

1:03:47.494 --> 1:03:52.232
but, I mean, other than that,
man, we lookin' kind of good.

1:03:52.266 --> 1:03:54.134
So Dave
ain't gonna take the stand.

1:03:54.167 --> 1:03:58.605
That means... That means
we killed Pat for nothin'.

1:03:58.639 --> 1:04:02.509
He could have flipped.
We were just coverin' our bases.

1:04:05.445 --> 1:04:08.048
Pat was in the game, man.
He knew what the fuck it was.

1:04:10.317 --> 1:04:14.621
You, um... You ain't havin' second
thoughts over there, are you, Sleepy?

1:04:15.857 --> 1:04:19.493
I wouldn't want that conscious
to get the best of you.

1:04:19.526 --> 1:04:25.332
You know, you feel a need, you have
to, um, I don't know talk to somebody?

1:04:26.667 --> 1:04:28.235
I'm straight.

1:04:31.305 --> 1:04:32.472
A'ight.

1:04:36.878 --> 1:04:38.345
Holler at you.

1:06:39.000 --> 1:06:40.567
Sleepy?

1:06:44.438 --> 1:06:46.273
What is it?

1:06:49.342 --> 1:06:51.611
I was hopin' I could come in
and rest for a little while?

1:06:52.579 --> 1:06:56.249
- I won't bother you or nothin'.
- You locked out of your house?

1:06:59.020 --> 1:07:01.221
My mother got her boyfriend
over again.

1:07:02.355 --> 1:07:05.193
Come on.
I'll make you a sandwich.

1:07:09.629 --> 1:07:10.798
Come on.

1:08:10.557 --> 1:08:13.693
Oh, why did you take him?

1:08:25.706 --> 1:08:31.545
<i>This is my block right here, the
house where I grew up at with my mother,</i>

1:08:31.578 --> 1:08:34.314
<i>my father,
and my brother James.</i>

1:08:35.116 --> 1:08:37.084
<i>I ain't never lived
nowhere else.</i>

1:08:37.118 --> 1:08:40.420
<i>40-some years old and
I still stay in the same bedroom</i>

1:08:40.453 --> 1:08:41.889
<i>where I used to sleep
next to James.</i>

1:08:43.124 --> 1:08:45.092
<i>James' been gone.</i>

1:08:45.126 --> 1:08:48.595
<i>He a lawyer in one of them
bougey firms they got downtown.</i>

1:08:50.131 --> 1:08:53.768
<i>It was me who took my father
to the VA hospital today.</i>

1:08:55.136 --> 1:08:58.806
<i>Pop's is fucked up permanent
from that Agent Orange.</i>

1:08:58.840 --> 1:09:02.109
<i>Do you think James would ever
drive our father to the hospital?</i>

1:09:02.143 --> 1:09:07.614
<i>Shoot. He don't even visit,
except for holidays.</i>

1:09:07.647 --> 1:09:09.917
<i>And this house ain't
but five miles away.</i>

1:09:11.152 --> 1:09:14.822
<i>Still,
he all my father talks about.</i>

1:09:15.488 --> 1:09:19.126
<i>James won this trial,
James got him a new Mercedes,</i>

1:09:19.160 --> 1:09:21.361
<i>James did this,
and James did that.</i>

1:09:21.929 --> 1:09:26.399
<i>Seems to me that I ain't never did
nothin' to make my father proud.</i>

1:09:27.168 --> 1:09:29.636
<i>Nothin' he knows about that is.</i>

1:09:32.173 --> 1:09:36.944
<i>It's a secret, but I've been working
with the police for a long time.</i>

1:09:38.179 --> 1:09:39.947
<i>I'm a confidential informant.</i>

1:09:41.983 --> 1:09:43.851
Franco Harris was a beast.

1:09:47.188 --> 1:09:50.791
- What do you know about it?
- I can play.

1:09:52.927 --> 1:09:54.594
Shoot.

1:09:56.529 --> 1:10:00.567
When you was a kid, I took you
on the field by the school.

1:10:01.601 --> 1:10:03.670
I tossed you
one of those little footballs.

1:10:04.939 --> 1:10:07.474
Told you to run to me
so I could tackle you.

1:10:08.209 --> 1:10:09.977
Show you what it felt like
to take a hit.

1:10:15.216 --> 1:10:16.784
I wasn't gonna hurt you.

1:10:23.791 --> 1:10:25.826
But you were too scared
to do it, Verdon.

1:10:29.864 --> 1:10:31.799
You was always soft.

1:10:40.875 --> 1:10:44.444
- I gotta bounce.
- Where you goin'?

1:10:44.912 --> 1:10:46.680
I know you ain't headed
for no job.

1:10:46.714 --> 1:10:48.682
I got a little somethin'
I'm workin' on.

1:11:45.706 --> 1:11:47.875
Stop fussin' with me.

1:11:47.908 --> 1:11:50.745
Ma be home in a minute.
About to be out.

1:12:02.857 --> 1:12:03.991
<i>And touchdown.</i>

1:12:04.025 --> 1:12:05.592
<i>That's one of the best plays
we've seen all year...</i>

1:12:05.625 --> 1:12:06.827
Shit.

1:12:36.891 --> 1:12:38.125
Hey.

1:12:39.160 --> 1:12:41.128
- What you want?
- Nothing you got.

1:12:41.896 --> 1:12:43.998
Then get your little
narrow ass back in your house.

1:12:44.031 --> 1:12:47.667
- You the one loiterin'.
- Mindin' my own like you ought to be.

1:12:47.701 --> 1:12:49.602
Ain't you got some schoolwork
or somethin'?

1:12:49.636 --> 1:12:51.839
- Did it.
- Yeah.

1:12:52.706 --> 1:12:55.142
- Where you go at? Tubman Middle?
- Yeah.

1:12:55.176 --> 1:12:57.745
- I went there, too.
- So?

1:13:00.114 --> 1:13:02.582
What you doin' standin' here
in my alley?

1:13:08.756 --> 1:13:11.158
Look, there goes my ride,
little man. You be easy, alright?

1:13:17.398 --> 1:13:21.035
Let's go up the block.
Too many eyes around here.

1:13:34.048 --> 1:13:36.884
- Verdon?
- It's Verdon.

1:13:38.752 --> 1:13:41.021
Verdon, talk to me.

1:13:41.889 --> 1:13:44.091
Y'all headed down
the wrong road, detective.

1:13:44.125 --> 1:13:45.793
Jesus Christ.

1:13:45.826 --> 1:13:48.628
You been rousting those corner boys in the
eights, that ain't gonna get you nothin'.

1:13:58.439 --> 1:14:00.941
Based on Rico's records,
it's a start.

1:14:01.942 --> 1:14:03.043
Kid was in it.

1:14:03.077 --> 1:14:07.081
He had juvenile priors
for possession, distribution.

1:14:07.114 --> 1:14:09.150
That was all
before he got straight.

1:14:09.183 --> 1:14:11.785
I've been knowin' his mother
since elementary.

1:14:11.819 --> 1:14:15.189
She got him into some
church thing and he changed.

1:14:15.890 --> 1:14:19.426
Rico was in the AP program at
his high school and everything.

1:14:19.460 --> 1:14:20.895
Boy was headed for college.

1:14:23.164 --> 1:14:26.000
So why'd someone put that lead
in his dome?

1:14:26.033 --> 1:14:31.805
What I heard, it was over a girl.
See Rico had a weakness for females.

1:14:32.473 --> 1:14:33.741
Who doesn't?

1:14:37.178 --> 1:14:38.779
You got a name on the hitter?

1:14:38.812 --> 1:14:40.014
Nah.

1:14:40.481 --> 1:14:42.750
- How about the girlfriend?
- Uh-uh.

1:14:45.219 --> 1:14:46.020
You sure?

1:14:48.822 --> 1:14:51.125
I'd talk to Rico's mom
if I was you.

1:14:54.161 --> 1:14:55.796
I already did that.

1:14:57.298 --> 1:14:59.266
She didn't mention a girlfriend.

1:15:02.002 --> 1:15:04.939
We searched Rico's room,
his laptop,

1:15:04.972 --> 1:15:06.941
there's no evidence of a girl
in his life.

1:15:06.974 --> 1:15:08.776
Just tellin' you what I heard,
that's all.

1:15:10.844 --> 1:15:14.081
- From who?
- No one in particular.

1:15:14.114 --> 1:15:16.116
I just been keeping my ear
to the street.

1:15:16.984 --> 1:15:21.021
I'mma keep tryin', but it get expensive,
man, buyin' people drinks and shit?

1:15:22.122 --> 1:15:24.225
Tryin' to loosen their tongues.
You feel me?

1:15:28.162 --> 1:15:33.300
Stay on it. I gotta put this down.
We caught one this mornin'?

1:15:35.069 --> 1:15:36.303
Bodies are stackin' up.

1:15:40.307 --> 1:15:41.875
Verdon.

1:15:43.944 --> 1:15:46.213
They got a little lake
over there on those grounds.

1:15:48.549 --> 1:15:51.352
I used to cane pole fish
back there when I was a kid.

1:15:52.353 --> 1:15:57.958
When I got older, I had his
girlfriend named Sondra.

1:15:58.559 --> 1:16:02.162
We hopped that fence,
took us a blanket,

1:16:02.196 --> 1:16:06.033
some screw-top wine,
little weed. Heh.

1:16:06.066 --> 1:16:08.002
Have us a good old time.

1:16:10.170 --> 1:16:12.239
She had this
Sony Walkman player.

1:16:13.173 --> 1:16:17.011
You know, for cassettes
and, uh, I made her a few tapes.

1:16:17.044 --> 1:16:20.848
Bobby Brown, Tone Loc,
other stuff she liked.

1:16:21.248 --> 1:16:25.953
She listened to it on her
earphones while I kept my head up.

1:16:27.187 --> 1:16:29.056
When I was done
layin' her out right,

1:16:30.324 --> 1:16:34.795
I tell her about the cars
I'd be drivin' someday,

1:16:35.596 --> 1:16:37.064
the big job I would have,

1:16:37.097 --> 1:16:41.101
and, uh, how I wouldn't need no high
school diploma to get those things.

1:16:42.303 --> 1:16:44.271
She looked at me
like she believed me.

1:16:45.205 --> 1:16:48.008
Sondra had
some pretty brown eyes.

1:16:48.042 --> 1:16:49.410
What happened to her?

1:16:50.745 --> 1:16:54.415
She married some ambulance chaser,
got office up on the Avenue.

1:16:56.183 --> 1:16:57.985
I seen her one time.

1:16:58.018 --> 1:17:00.321
She was visitin' her parents
back in the 'hood.

1:17:01.021 --> 1:17:03.023
Bum-rushin' the kids
in the house like they get sick

1:17:03.057 --> 1:17:04.325
if they breathe this air
or somethin'.

1:17:07.227 --> 1:17:11.298
She saw me, too.
She looked away.

1:17:12.166 --> 1:17:14.234
Act like she didn't know
who I was.

1:17:16.203 --> 1:17:18.405
She could rewrite history
if she want to.

1:17:19.673 --> 1:17:21.208
And that fancy husband?

1:17:22.643 --> 1:17:26.246
He gonna never have what I had,
'cause I had that pussy when it was new.

1:17:31.185 --> 1:17:33.420
See what you can get me
on this Rico murder.

1:17:34.655 --> 1:17:38.192
- I need a name.
- I will.

1:17:45.399 --> 1:17:48.435
<i>We was at Rico's
wake at his mother's house.</i>

1:17:50.237 --> 1:17:51.872
<i>Me and Leticia.</i>

1:17:55.676 --> 1:17:59.346
<i>Up in Rico's bedroom,
we found a photograph of Flora.</i>

1:18:01.281 --> 1:18:04.051
<i>You know,
the kind you take at the mall.</i>

1:18:04.084 --> 1:18:08.255
<i>In the picture, the strap of her
shirt was comin' off her shoulder,</i>

1:18:08.288 --> 1:18:10.391
<i>showin' the tops
of her little titties.</i>

1:18:12.459 --> 1:18:16.029
<i>These young girls all tryin'
to look like sluts you ask me.</i>

1:19:20.561 --> 1:19:23.230
- Verdon.
- Leticia.

1:19:25.399 --> 1:19:27.367
- Ain't you gonna ask me in?
- No.

1:19:28.202 --> 1:19:29.536
What's wrong with you, girl?

1:19:30.504 --> 1:19:34.074
I don't wanna see you
and you can't come in.

1:19:34.107 --> 1:19:37.311
- I got some good smoke?
- Go away, Verdon.

1:19:38.345 --> 1:19:40.314
What's wrong?
Why you so upset, Leti?

1:19:41.315 --> 1:19:43.016
Marquis came by.

1:19:45.118 --> 1:19:46.119
That's right.

1:19:48.188 --> 1:19:51.024
Flora must have told him
about our conversation with her.

1:19:52.159 --> 1:19:56.096
Marquis and me came
to an understandin', Verdon.

1:19:57.264 --> 1:19:59.299
You backin' out this on me,
Leticia?

1:20:01.268 --> 1:20:04.371
How much money we're lookin'
to collect on that tip line?

1:20:05.807 --> 1:20:09.576
1,000? We supposed
to split that, right?

1:20:10.577 --> 1:20:11.678
That's what we said.

1:20:11.713 --> 1:20:15.048
I ain't tryin' to get
myself killed for $500.

1:20:15.082 --> 1:20:16.483
Neither am I.

1:20:19.821 --> 1:20:22.456
Then you better go somewhere
for a while, Verdon.

1:20:24.124 --> 1:20:26.293
Leave outta here for real.

1:20:29.831 --> 1:20:32.432
Flora told Marquis,
there was a skinny,

1:20:32.466 --> 1:20:35.168
older-lookin' dude,
the day I braced her.

1:20:36.370 --> 1:20:38.338
But Flora ain't know my name,
though.

1:20:45.312 --> 1:20:49.149
You said my name to Marquis?
You gave me up, Leticia?

1:20:53.287 --> 1:20:56.657
You gave me up?
You gave me up, Leticia?

1:21:29.423 --> 1:21:31.625
I'm tryin' to tell you,
yo, I mean, she cool,

1:21:31.658 --> 1:21:34.461
but that bitch has got
a big-ass head and shit.

1:21:34.494 --> 1:21:36.296
- Hey, she got fat ass, though.
- Yeah.

1:21:36.330 --> 1:21:38.498
- She fat as a motherfucker.
- Yo.

1:21:38.532 --> 1:21:40.534
- What's up, slim?
- Fuck is this?

1:21:40.567 --> 1:21:44.338
Fuck you get that jacket from,
Baby Gap?

1:21:44.371 --> 1:21:47.341
- Yo, look at that nigga, yo.
- Yeah.

1:21:47.374 --> 1:21:49.443
- Look at this nigga.
- Yeah.

1:21:49.476 --> 1:21:50.510
Timbs is done.

1:22:18.605 --> 1:22:20.507
- Verdon!
- Robo!

1:22:20.540 --> 1:22:24.411
- What you upto, man?
- Ain't nothin', man. Just gettin' a little wine.

1:22:24.444 --> 1:22:28.682
Man, I could use a little taste,
too. Get you back on payday.

1:22:28.716 --> 1:22:30.718
Payday?
Where you workin' at, man?

1:22:41.996 --> 1:22:43.497
Hold up, Verdon.

1:22:43.530 --> 1:22:48.502
Look, I've been in here for a couple
hours tryin' to stay warm and shit

1:22:48.535 --> 1:22:50.270
and I heard some things.

1:22:50.303 --> 1:22:51.471
Like what?

1:22:52.539 --> 1:22:54.742
Some boys was in here
earlier askin' about you.

1:22:54.776 --> 1:22:57.177
One of 'em had silver fronts
in his mouth.

1:22:57.577 --> 1:23:00.681
They described you
and that hat you always wearin'.

1:23:02.315 --> 1:23:04.451
But I ain't tell him nothin',
Verdon.

1:23:04.484 --> 1:23:06.954
There was this other bama
that they talked to, though.

1:23:06.988 --> 1:23:10.190
He told the dude with the fronts
in his mouth where you stay at.

1:23:11.458 --> 1:23:13.193
where my people stay?

1:23:15.529 --> 1:23:17.230
Come on, man.
Let's get out of here.

1:23:25.605 --> 1:23:31.746
- You want bag? 5 cent for bag.
- Thanks, man.

1:23:53.366 --> 1:23:56.738
- Where you about to go now, V?
- I don't know.

1:23:56.771 --> 1:24:01.743
Guess I'll just walk around some.
Let this wine kiss my head.

1:24:04.511 --> 1:24:09.316
<i>Me and Leticia caught up to
Flora, Leticia stepped her.</i>

1:24:09.349 --> 1:24:11.719
<i>Leti can be intimidating
and shit when she want to.</i>

1:24:11.753 --> 1:24:14.421
- I don't fuckin' know.
- Now, tell me his name.

1:24:14.454 --> 1:24:16.623
- Come on!
- Marquis Roberts!

1:24:16.656 --> 1:24:18.760
<i>Flora gave it up.</i>

1:24:18.793 --> 1:24:23.497
<i>She was there when Marquis Roberts came
up on Rico and doomed him with that nine.</i>

1:24:24.431 --> 1:24:28.368
<i>Flora and Leticia, they ain't
gonna say nothin' to nobody now.</i>

1:24:28.401 --> 1:24:29.737
<i>That leaves me.</i>

1:24:54.427 --> 1:25:00.333
Hey, little man. Help me out.
Call 911, here?

1:25:06.439 --> 1:25:07.574
Fuck.

1:26:23.818 --> 1:26:25.452
Verdon.

1:26:40.600 --> 1:26:41.969
Come here.

1:27:16.837 --> 1:27:18.505
<i>I ain't afraid.</i>

1:27:18.906 --> 1:27:22.977
<i>Detective Barnes gonna find out
everything when he finds me,</i>

1:27:24.577 --> 1:27:27.748
<i>but first,
I need to speak to my father.</i>

1:27:28.716 --> 1:27:31.484
<i>Tell him that I ain't
the low ass bum he thinks I am.</i>

1:27:32.619 --> 1:27:35.522
<i>I've been working with
the police for a long time.</i>

1:27:36.656 --> 1:27:39.827
<i>Matter of fact?
I solved a murder.</i>

1:27:41.561 --> 1:27:44.966
<i>I'm a confidential informant,
Pop. Look at me.</i>
