Because I was up all night painting.

01:23.250 --> 01:26.545
Oh, but I am totally focused
on the business.

01:26.629 --> 01:28.089
I'm a laser beam.

Chhh! [chuckles]

01:30.299 --> 01:31.842
Hello. Sorry to keep you waiting.

01:31.926 --> 01:34.762
It's a busy morning. New copy machine.

01:34.845 --> 01:36.138
I'm Derrick Flout.

01:36.222 --> 01:38.349
Derrick, very nice to meet you.

01:38.432 --> 01:40.309
So nice to meet you, Derrick.

01:40.392 --> 01:41.435
Likewise.

01:41.519 --> 01:46.482
So, uh, you should know what I do
is accept your loan application,

01:46.565 --> 01:49.819
or not, and hand it over
to the underwriting department,

01:49.902 --> 01:51.821

01:51.904 --> 01:53.656

[clears throat] Well, I'm...
I'm Grace Hanson, and this is--

01:57.284 --> 02:00.162
And I am Frankie Bergstein,
head of Creative.

02:00.246 --> 02:03.541
And, um... this is our business plan.

02:03.624 --> 02:07.211
Very comprehensive. Thoroughly proofread.

02:25.479 --> 02:26.897
Tender vaginal tissue.

02:28.107 --> 02:29.066
That's important.

02:29.150 --> 02:30.484
[Grace chuckles] I let her say that.

02:31.443 --> 02:33.195
Actually, there's no stopping her.

02:33.279 --> 02:37.324
[forced chuckle]
Okay, uh, so we don't need to discuss

02:37.408 --> 02:39.952
every vivid detail of the business.

02:40.035 --> 02:44.206
Got it, Derrick.
Well, we would like a $75,000 loan,

02:44.290 --> 02:49.253
and we're hoping for 3.45 percent
rather than the usual 4.1.

02:50.045 --> 02:51.881
I'm assuming this would be
a short-term loan?

02:51.964 --> 02:53.215
No, we'd like ten years.

02:53.299 --> 02:54.175
-Ten years?
-Mm-hmm.

02:55.426 --> 02:56.510
Uh-huh.

02:57.553 --> 02:59.096
And you'd be paying that back...

02:59.179 --> 03:01.098
Well, within ten years.

03:01.932 --> 03:03.601
As is common in a ten-year loan.

03:04.560 --> 03:07.438
And we'll throw in a free vibrator
for your lady friend

03:07.521 --> 03:10.107
after you give us the $75,000.

03:10.941 --> 03:11.775
Uh-huh.

-Very nice. Thank you.
-[all laugh]

03:14.862 --> 03:15.988
[Frankie] Yeah.

03:16.071 --> 03:20.576
So... I don't think that a ten-year loan

03:20.659 --> 03:22.828
would be prudent at this time.

03:22.912 --> 03:24.205
For our bank.

03:24.580 --> 03:25.414
With you.

03:25.998 --> 03:27.416
Well, uh...

03:27.625 --> 03:29.793
Would a seven-year loan be prudent?

03:29.877 --> 03:32.379
I'm not sure seven is realistic.

03:32.963 --> 03:36.091
What do you think is prudently realistic?

03:36.675 --> 03:38.761
Somewhere in the one-year range.

03:40.095 --> 03:41.430
I'm not the accountant here,

03:41.513 --> 03:45.976
but that doesn't seem like much
of a range, Derrick.

03:46.560 --> 03:50.522
I've done the break-even analysis and
it's gonna take at least four years to--

03:53.067 --> 03:55.402
Oh, my God.
I know what's going on here.

03:55.486 --> 03:59.615
Me too. This is about you
being afraid of female sexuality.

04:00.532 --> 04:03.786
You're one of those bankers
who's never read<i> Our Bodies, Ourselves.</i>

04:03.869 --> 04:05.913
It was banned at my school,
but one of my friends had it.

04:05.996 --> 04:08.958
Oh, so you did read it?
I'm confused.

04:09.041 --> 04:11.543
He's not gonna give us a loan
because he thinks we're too old.

04:11.627 --> 04:15.339
Too old?
I was blasting Drake all the way here.

04:15.422 --> 04:16.715
You know what this is?

04:17.341 --> 04:19.969
Ageist. Ageist bullshit!

04:20.052 --> 04:23.764
Ladies, there are many, many factors
that go into loan decisions.

04:23.847 --> 04:25.849
Oh, I'm sure. There's how old you are,

04:25.933 --> 04:27.893
there's how many birthdays
you have left--

04:27.977 --> 04:29.687
How much pubic hair you have left.

04:29.770 --> 04:31.355
See? No stopping her.

Come on, Frankie, let's get out of here.

to a different bank.

That's what we have to do.

04:53.836 --> 04:56.005
They all need breaking up anyway.

04:56.088 --> 04:57.756
We'll start with this one.

04:57.840 --> 04:59.883
We'll form an old lady gang.

05:00.301 --> 05:02.261
We're creaky, but tough.

05:02.344 --> 05:03.762
We're forgetful, but fierce.

05:03.846 --> 05:06.307
Gravity may be no friend of ours,

05:06.390 --> 05:08.934
but that doesn't mean
our bottom line will bottom out.

05:09.018 --> 05:11.270
Right. It's so insulting.

05:12.354 --> 05:14.398
Do we look like we're about to die?

05:15.190 --> 05:18.360
Do we look like we're senile
and can't remember anything?

05:19.236 --> 05:20.362
Where is the car?

05:20.446 --> 05:23.365
[Frankie]
I thought you were paying attention.

05:23.449 --> 05:26.076
I told you to take a picture of the space.

05:26.160 --> 05:27.619
-I did!

05:30.247 --> 05:31.874

sit down and talk, you know, face-to-face?

05:53.687 --> 05:54.980
Uh-huh.

05:56.106 --> 05:59.193
Well, youth is fleeting
and you have a weird laugh.

05:59.276 --> 06:02.279
Another no. This one Googled us.

06:02.362 --> 06:04.907
She knows our combined age is 146.

06:04.990 --> 06:07.076
Well, then time to call Tomato Bank.

06:08.285 --> 06:09.995
What is that,
some farmer's market thing?

06:10.079 --> 06:13.373
Tomato Bank is Chinatown's
most easy-going loan service.

06:13.457 --> 06:15.334
My friend Guang works there.

06:15.417 --> 06:17.336
Well, he'll probably say "no," too.

06:17.419 --> 06:18.962
Only he'll say it in Chinese.

06:22.049 --> 06:24.551
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Are you going to do the dishes?

06:24.635 --> 06:27.012
Two days. I need two days.

06:27.096 --> 06:31.558
And then after the art show I will call
the banks, I will revisit the dishes.

06:31.642 --> 06:32.768
I don't think you understand.

06:32.851 --> 06:36.021
You have paintings to finish,
but I have to walk into that gallery

06:36.105 --> 06:38.857
with a loan that I can shove
in our families' faces.

06:38.941 --> 06:40.776
I think you're missing
the point of my art show.

06:41.568 --> 06:42.861
No, I'm not.

06:44.655 --> 06:47.157
Okay, everyone, come in, come in.

06:47.241 --> 06:48.992
Ooh!

06:49.076 --> 06:51.495
-And this is the entranceway.
-Wow.

06:51.578 --> 06:52.913
That could be a study.

06:52.996 --> 06:54.832
-Are you squeaking?
-Yeah, it's my shoes.

06:54.915 --> 06:57.459
-And this is the living room, of course.
-What are they?

06:57.543 --> 06:59.002
-Golf shoes.
-Why?

06:59.086 --> 07:00.087
I'm breaking them in.

07:00.170 --> 07:01.672
Because not only does he teach band...

07:01.755 --> 07:05.217
I am also coach of the girls' golf team.
Thank you, staff cuts.

07:06.510 --> 07:10.389
And, uh... this is a fireplace, of course.
And it works.

07:10.472 --> 07:13.517
-So are you kids going to Mom's opening?
-[Coyote] Yeah.

07:13.600 --> 07:14.810
-Oh, boy.
-[Coyote] We'll be there.

07:14.893 --> 07:15.811
-I'll be there.
-Of course.

07:15.894 --> 07:19.523
We found this house on Zillow
and it was built in 1928.

07:19.606 --> 07:21.024
Now, if you'll follow me, please.

07:21.108 --> 07:22.526
-Is Mitch coming?
-Who's Mitch?

07:22.609 --> 07:24.903
Oh! That's your husband
who doesn't come to anything.

07:24.987 --> 07:27.906
Okay, I'm sorry he didn't show up
at your dog's birthday party.

07:27.990 --> 07:29.783
He was busy bringing life into this world.

07:50.679 --> 07:52.181
She's my ride-or-die bitch.

07:52.264 --> 07:53.474
Well, good.

07:53.557 --> 07:56.852
Because Frankie should have
the support of her family.

07:56.935 --> 07:58.437
And Allison.

07:58.520 --> 08:00.772
Ooh, the new lady!
Then I will bring Barry.

08:00.856 --> 08:03.192
Because he's been bugging me
to spend more time with the family

08:03.275 --> 08:06.028
and now everyone will be so focused
on what a loser Allison is

08:06.111 --> 08:09.781
-that I'll just slide him in unnoticed.
-Over here is where we'll cook things.

08:09.865 --> 08:11.200
[Bud] Allison is fantastic.

08:11.283 --> 08:15.037
She has a real job
and a working vehicle.

08:15.120 --> 08:18.081
I'm glad you're all going to be there.
That'll be nice for Frankie.

08:18.957 --> 08:21.418
Dad, you're not thinking about going,
are you?

08:21.502 --> 08:23.462
N-No, that would be a bad idea.

08:23.545 --> 08:25.672
-Kenny Loggins bad.
-Having twins bad.

08:25.756 --> 08:27.841
This is the room
where we eat the things we cook.

08:27.925 --> 08:31.470
Don't you think she might perceive
my not being there as unsupportive?

08:32.846 --> 08:34.765
And that's the car dealership.

08:34.848 --> 08:36.683
Haven't you left her
a million messages already?

08:36.767 --> 08:37.976
Has she answered one?

08:38.060 --> 08:39.895
Not with words.

08:39.978 --> 08:43.315
Oh, for heaven sakes,
how do you kids feel about the house?

08:45.275 --> 08:46.568
-It's great.
-Nice windows.

08:46.652 --> 08:49.029
It's really open.
The feng shui is all right.

08:49.112 --> 08:50.572
But more importantly, do you like it?

08:50.656 --> 08:52.115
We love it.

08:52.741 --> 08:53.909
We really do.

08:54.952 --> 08:57.412
Maybe Frankie secretly wants me
to be there.

08:57.496 --> 08:59.081
Oh, God, Sol.

08:59.164 --> 09:00.832
-Nice place, Dad.
-Thank you.

09:00.916 --> 09:02.960
-Oh, look, Dad! Tile!
-[Mallory] Love you guys.

09:03.043 --> 09:05.170
-Love you, Dad. Love the house.
-Don't go to the show.

09:08.715 --> 09:11.760
Sol, the only reason
you want to go to her show

09:11.843 --> 09:14.638
is because you hate it
when people are mad at you.

09:14.721 --> 09:17.015
I just prefer to have everybody like me.

09:18.016 --> 09:19.851
Or I can't leave my house...

09:20.686 --> 09:22.020
or my bed.

09:22.104 --> 09:25.107
Well, you do whatever you want,
but I'm not going.

09:25.190 --> 09:29.111
Because, unlike you, I do not enjoy
going to places where I'm not wanted.

09:29.194 --> 09:33.073
This is probably the most important day
of Frankie's life.

09:33.156 --> 09:35.409
How can I not be there?

09:35.492 --> 09:37.369
By not going.

09:37.452 --> 09:39.705
I'm gonna stay home
and eat guacamole with a spoon,

09:39.788 --> 09:41.331
but you're welcome to go

09:41.415 --> 09:45.335
and have yet another tortured interaction
with our ex-wives.

09:45.419 --> 09:49.298
So you're okay that things are lousy
between you and Grace?

09:49.381 --> 09:50.966
I'm not okay with it,

09:51.049 --> 09:55.262
but the art show is not the time
or the place to work on our relationship.

09:55.345 --> 09:56.305
How do you know?

09:56.388 --> 09:57.681
Because I know everything.

09:57.764 --> 10:00.642
-What if I know going is the right thing?
-I know you're wrong.

10:00.726 --> 10:04.146
And if you're hoping to get Frankie
to let go of the Kenny Loggins thing,

10:04.229 --> 10:05.188
forget it.

10:05.272 --> 10:07.107
There's nothing you can do
to make up for that.

10:07.190 --> 10:08.942
-There's gotta be something.
-There's nothing.

10:10.152 --> 10:11.653
-Something.
-Nothing.

10:26.084 --> 10:27.711
[sighs]

10:29.630 --> 10:32.382
Are you gonna touch
every piece of cheese?

10:32.883 --> 10:35.344
Do you think it would help calm me down?
Because I'll do it.

10:35.427 --> 10:36.970
Oh, Frankie, relax.

10:37.054 --> 10:38.722
You've waited for this your whole life.

10:38.805 --> 10:40.974
I know, I know. It's great.

10:41.058 --> 10:44.227
It's here. It's horrible.
This is a nightmare.

10:44.311 --> 10:46.688
-Frankie?
-Yes?

10:46.772 --> 10:49.733
We're going to open the doors
in a few moments. Are you ready?

10:49.816 --> 10:51.526
What are those?

10:51.610 --> 10:54.279
We put a red dot on each painting
once it sells.

10:54.363 --> 10:55.405
Can I do it?

10:55.489 --> 10:58.075
-No. We do it.
-Let her do it.

11:01.536 --> 11:02.412
[exhales]

11:03.163 --> 11:04.831
Oh God, oh God, oh God.

11:04.915 --> 11:06.750
Maybe it's time for a little pot spray.

11:06.833 --> 11:08.126
What if none of them sell?

11:08.210 --> 11:11.213
What if all these little red dots
are here at the end of the night?

11:11.296 --> 11:12.672
It doesn't matter, Frankie.

11:12.756 --> 11:15.092
You still did it.
You pulled this show together.

11:15.801 --> 11:18.303
-Babe would be so proud of you.
-Oh, Babe.

11:19.096 --> 11:21.973
What if she misses her dinner
up in heaven,

11:22.057 --> 11:25.352
watching over this
and it's a total failure?

11:25.435 --> 11:28.772
Maybe there's a joint in your purse
that you forgot about?

11:29.481 --> 11:32.109
-Oh, my God.
-Hey, Mom. Frankie!

11:32.192 --> 11:34.027
Good God, what is that?

11:34.111 --> 11:36.488
This is the poncho
that Frankie made for me.

11:36.571 --> 11:38.657
I love it. Love it so hard.

11:38.740 --> 11:40.534
Yeah, well you're wearing it backwards.

11:40.617 --> 11:43.412
And truthfully,
you don't have the body for it.

11:43.495 --> 11:45.580
Frankie, I'm trying here.

11:46.331 --> 11:50.460
We have a relationship to repair.
We can't just throw yarn at it.

11:53.004 --> 11:54.756
[sighs]

11:54.840 --> 11:56.216
She's a little anxious.

11:56.299 --> 11:57.717
Still mad?

11:57.801 --> 12:00.470
It's not like you to be upset
when someone's upset with you.

12:00.554 --> 12:03.598
I know, but it's Frankie.
And she was like a mother to me.

12:05.350 --> 12:06.852
You were also like a mother to me.

12:06.935 --> 12:08.562
"Like a mother"?

12:09.229 --> 12:12.232
She wasn't a replacement mother.
She's another mother.

12:12.315 --> 12:14.025
More love. More love is so good.

12:14.109 --> 12:16.445
It's a whole village of-- Barry!

12:16.528 --> 12:20.866
Barry, say hello to my favorite mother!

12:20.949 --> 12:22.492
Mom, you remember Barry from the office.

12:22.576 --> 12:24.327
It is so nice to see you again, Grace.

12:24.411 --> 12:26.705
You, too. Why are you here?

12:27.914 --> 12:32.335
So, Mom, Barry and I are, um...

12:33.086 --> 12:35.005
We are... together.

12:35.505 --> 12:37.257
-That the word you were looking for?
-Pretty close.

12:37.340 --> 12:39.217
-Good.
-Goodness, I didn't...

12:40.093 --> 12:41.470
He is with you?

12:41.553 --> 12:43.597
But he's so nice.

12:43.680 --> 12:44.598
[chuckles]

12:44.681 --> 12:45.891
Thank you, Mom.

12:45.974 --> 12:49.352
Anytime, darling.
You've always been like a daughter to me.

12:49.436 --> 12:51.813
So Grace, how are you?

12:51.897 --> 12:55.150
Thank you for asking, Barry. I am superb.

12:55.233 --> 12:57.694
Frankie and I are fielding loan offers.

12:57.777 --> 13:00.739
It's good, good, good,
good, good, good, good, good.

13:02.616 --> 13:05.619
-Well, I guess she's good.
-She seems really good. Yeah.

13:06.495 --> 13:09.122
[lounge music playing]

13:13.752 --> 13:15.462
-[chuckles]
-Mm.

13:16.379 --> 13:18.632
This is amazing.

13:18.715 --> 13:20.217
How do you feel?

13:20.300 --> 13:22.677
Frankly, I feel like barfing
in my handbag.

13:22.761 --> 13:24.471
Oh, so you found your handbag.

13:25.639 --> 13:28.099
No, no, this is Grace's.

13:28.183 --> 13:30.477
Do you see any red dots?

13:30.560 --> 13:33.480
I see the ones that's in your hand.

13:33.563 --> 13:35.941
And now I see Sol.

13:38.985 --> 13:40.195
Oh, Sol.

13:41.488 --> 13:43.365
That guy's really got a pair on him.

13:43.448 --> 13:45.784
Don't worry, I got it.

13:48.870 --> 13:51.790
-It is so nice to finally meet you.
-So nice to meet you, too.

13:51.873 --> 13:55.252
And this is Mallory's husband, Mitch.

13:55.335 --> 13:56.920
He's working.

13:57.003 --> 14:01.091
Yes, one of his famous emergency
get-out-of-the-art-show babies.

14:01.174 --> 14:03.385
Well, I was an art-show baby.

14:05.345 --> 14:06.805
I was just trying to break the tension.

14:06.888 --> 14:08.431
Oh, there's no tension here.

14:08.515 --> 14:12.143
-Right, Mitch? Back me up, buddy.
-Okay. [clears throat]

14:20.735 --> 14:21.987
Who'd have thunk it,

14:22.070 --> 14:25.156
when we first met at your farm stand,

14:25.240 --> 14:28.702
that one day, we'd be standing here,

14:28.785 --> 14:30.912
shoulder to shoulder...

14:31.913 --> 14:36.543
the gay ex-husband, the new lover,
supporting our lady.

14:38.295 --> 14:41.631
I mean... your lady, my ex-lady. [scoffs]

14:42.799 --> 14:45.260
It's all good. We're cool.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.889
I think now might be a good time
to go over and say hi.

14:48.972 --> 14:49.848
I wouldn't.

14:52.684 --> 14:55.228
So I should just stay here
and talk to you?

14:55.312 --> 14:57.480
I think that's your sweet spot.

14:58.732 --> 15:00.150
[sighs]

15:02.027 --> 15:05.280
You can see the rage toward me
in every brush stroke.

15:07.574 --> 15:10.160
Notice the bold use of yellow?

15:10.243 --> 15:12.454
That's because I hate mustard.

15:20.962 --> 15:23.548
[indistinct chattering]

15:24.132 --> 15:26.468
-Oh! It's starting.
-[Brianna exclaims]

15:26.551 --> 15:27.636
[Barry] What's starting?

15:27.719 --> 15:30.055
The "Bud's Super-Needy Girlfriend"
drinking game.

15:30.138 --> 15:31.848
You're gonna want to eat something first.

15:31.932 --> 15:34.643
-[Barry] Oh, she looks lovely.
-[Mallory] They always look lovely.

15:34.726 --> 15:37.228
This is great,
I can't even play the game I invented.

15:39.898 --> 15:41.066
Okay, Frankie?

15:41.149 --> 15:45.111
Someone has one thing,
just one thing, to say to you.

15:45.195 --> 15:49.282
Frankie, the work in this collection
blows me away.

15:49.366 --> 15:50.825
Put a sock in it, Sol.

15:50.909 --> 15:52.118
I told you, man.

15:52.202 --> 15:53.036
He told you.

15:53.787 --> 15:55.997
Since when are there egg rolls?

15:58.625 --> 15:59.876
[scoffs]

16:00.669 --> 16:03.380
And that's when I realized
I have celiac disease.

16:03.463 --> 16:07.217
-Oh, of course you do.
-Gluten allergies are so common nowadays.

16:07.300 --> 16:10.011
-Oh, gosh, global warming.
-[Coyote] Yeah.

16:10.095 --> 16:12.973
-It's real. It's very real.
-[Mallory] Sucks.

16:13.056 --> 16:14.599
[Coyote] Do you have other allergies?

16:14.683 --> 16:16.559
It's quicker to list the things
I'm not allergic to.

16:16.643 --> 16:17.936
[Brianna] Mm-hmm.

16:19.562 --> 16:21.147
Plums.

16:21.231 --> 16:22.482
I don't even like them that much.

16:27.445 --> 16:29.698
Why are you all drinking in a clump?

16:30.865 --> 16:36.162
We are... just celebrating the fact that
I'm going to buy one of your paintings.

16:36.246 --> 16:37.414
Oh, really?

16:38.498 --> 16:40.667
Which one spoke to you?

16:41.501 --> 16:44.713
The... second least expensive one.

16:44.796 --> 16:45.964
Uh-huh.

16:46.047 --> 16:49.384
And Mitch is so sad he's missing this,
he said to get one to bring home.

16:49.467 --> 16:50.885
Oh, cut the crap, you two.

16:50.969 --> 16:52.887
Nobody's buying any paintings.

16:52.971 --> 16:54.848
I don't mean "nobody," I mean you people.

16:54.931 --> 16:56.808
No family can buy art.

16:56.891 --> 17:01.021
I don't want any part of your pity ponchos
or your pity purchases.

17:01.104 --> 17:05.066
If you love a piece,
I will give it to you free of charge.

17:05.150 --> 17:07.694
And "free of charge"
does not include delivery.

17:11.281 --> 17:13.783
I once ordered a pizza
and then I got robbed.

17:13.867 --> 17:15.618
-Right.
-I can see that.

17:16.161 --> 17:19.080
I'm much more like that one,
I think, than this one.

17:19.164 --> 17:21.249
[Judy]
Yeah, well, whatever you see, honey.

17:21.332 --> 17:22.250
They're both handsome.

17:22.333 --> 17:24.127
[gasps] Grace!

17:24.210 --> 17:25.336
-[Peter] Hey.
-Hey, there.

17:25.420 --> 17:27.088
-[Judy] Hi.
-Hi.

17:27.839 --> 17:30.925
-Hey! Hey, hey.
-Oh, yeah. Right.

17:31.009 --> 17:32.135
Peter.

17:32.218 --> 17:34.012
Oh, I feel your belt.

17:34.095 --> 17:36.056
-Oh!
-How are you, Grace?

17:36.139 --> 17:37.891
Oh, thank you for asking, Judy. I'm fine.

17:37.974 --> 17:40.393
So, what's new? Are you seeing anybody?

17:40.477 --> 17:42.145
[laughs]
That's a rude question, Peter.

17:42.228 --> 17:44.814
I don't have time for that.
I'm too busy with my new business.

17:44.898 --> 17:46.483
Good for you.

17:46.566 --> 17:48.860
No, good for you, Judy.
Trust me. Good for you.

17:48.943 --> 17:51.738
And maybe good for you, too, Peter,
if you're open.

17:51.821 --> 17:52.864
He's not.

17:52.947 --> 17:55.867
I mean, I have no idea what you're talking
about, but I'm telling you, he's not.

17:55.950 --> 17:57.452
-I might be.
-You're not.

17:59.079 --> 18:00.288
I'm not.

18:00.371 --> 18:03.917
-Frankie.
-Sol, quit shadowing me, man.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.502
You are so brave.

18:05.585 --> 18:07.712
Oh, stop! I don't need your fake support.

18:07.796 --> 18:12.008
I don't need anybody but me
to tell me that I'm an artist.

18:12.092 --> 18:15.637
Not even, perhaps, Sir Kenneth Loggins?

18:15.720 --> 18:16.554
Oh, really?

18:16.638 --> 18:19.057
He's the last freaking person
I need to hear from.

18:19.140 --> 18:22.018
How do you even mention his name to me?

18:22.102 --> 18:22.977
-Excuse me.
-[scoffs]

18:23.728 --> 18:26.147
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

18:27.398 --> 18:30.110
-You're here. Why are you here?
-It's my military training.

18:30.193 --> 18:32.320
Never leave a man behind
in hostile territory.

18:32.403 --> 18:34.906
I did a bad thing, Robert.
I did a very bad thing.

18:34.989 --> 18:37.575
You've been here for ten minutes.
What could you have possibly done?

18:37.659 --> 18:39.494
I did it before I came.

18:41.746 --> 18:44.124
Okay, that tracks.

18:46.501 --> 18:49.087
-Hello, Grace.
-Robert.

18:49.754 --> 18:50.713
How are you?

18:50.797 --> 18:53.091
Oh, so good.

18:53.174 --> 18:54.843
So, so good.

18:54.926 --> 18:56.928
So much happening with the business.

18:57.011 --> 18:59.639
-So, things are good?
-Things are good.

18:59.722 --> 19:01.891
-How about with you?
-Things are good with me, too.

19:02.767 --> 19:04.185
My things are better.

19:05.812 --> 19:08.648
It turns out
that my accountant was a bigamist,

19:08.731 --> 19:10.900
who wasn't technically even an accountant.

19:13.820 --> 19:16.281
I have to pee. Hey, Bud,
do you have my special soap?

19:18.741 --> 19:21.828
[sniffs] I hope it's still good.
I lost my sense of smell.

19:24.080 --> 19:25.415
No. No, you're not.

19:25.498 --> 19:26.666
Yes, we are.

19:26.749 --> 19:28.918
I told you that drinking game bothers me!

19:29.002 --> 19:30.420
That little bag of soap bothers me.

19:32.005 --> 19:33.882
You know what? You guys suck.

19:33.965 --> 19:35.550
So sorry, I'm new here, so...

19:35.633 --> 19:38.636
Allison's great. Unlike you, she's kind.
She has a big heart.

19:38.720 --> 19:41.431
Oh, we know,
she told us about that condition.

19:41.514 --> 19:44.058
-[chuckles]
-Fuck you all.

19:44.142 --> 19:46.352
I like her more than I like
you people right now.

19:46.436 --> 19:48.771
-He's gonna go help her wipe.
-I heard that!

19:48.855 --> 19:50.481
False alarm. Nothing came out.

19:50.565 --> 19:52.775
[guffawing]

19:53.693 --> 19:54.527
Ooh!

19:54.611 --> 19:56.112
-We should line up a few more.
-[Mallory] Mm-hmm.

19:57.280 --> 19:59.532
Should I have sold a painting by now?

19:59.616 --> 20:01.284
Should I have sold 12 paintings?

20:01.367 --> 20:04.746
Are they bidding over the phone?
Have you been on the horn with Japan?

20:05.330 --> 20:06.497
I hate Japan.

20:07.123 --> 20:08.958
They only buy masterpieces.

20:11.794 --> 20:13.630
I just had a thought. I had a thought.

20:13.713 --> 20:15.882
Family can't buy paintings, but you can.

20:15.965 --> 20:19.302
Right. I guess I should probably
buy all the paintings I can now,

20:19.385 --> 20:21.387
since, if I play my cards right...

20:22.096 --> 20:26.434
someday I might, you know,
actually be family.

20:27.310 --> 20:32.315
So by "family" you mean like people
who choose to be related... by choice?

20:32.398 --> 20:34.025
Yes, by choice.

20:37.820 --> 20:40.615
So, what do you think about that?

20:42.242 --> 20:44.452
Right now what do I think about that,
like, right now?

20:44.535 --> 20:47.205
You realize you can only stall so much
by repeating back to me what I say?

20:47.288 --> 20:49.082
I can only stall so long
by repeating back to you--

20:49.165 --> 20:51.751
-Stop it!
-Can we not have this conversation here?

20:51.834 --> 20:53.294
I just...

20:54.295 --> 20:58.049
I thought we were headed
in a certain direction.

20:59.008 --> 21:01.094
Barry, you know me.
I'm not a future person.

21:01.177 --> 21:04.889
I'm more of a, "This is so good,
let's keep doing this," person.

21:04.973 --> 21:07.809
Right, but at some point
if we keep doing this,

21:07.892 --> 21:09.936
it takes us into the future.

21:12.897 --> 21:15.400
Do you even see me in that future?

21:17.694 --> 21:22.740
I don't not... see...

21:24.325 --> 21:26.327
-Not--
-Oh, my God.

21:26.411 --> 21:31.040
No, it's not you, Barry.
I don't see myself

21:31.124 --> 21:33.668
with more family in the future.

21:35.295 --> 21:37.046
I thought you knew this.

21:37.630 --> 21:38.631
I do now.

21:40.174 --> 21:41.134
Barry...

21:50.768 --> 21:51.853
[sighs]

21:51.936 --> 21:55.148
I noticed you gave up
when the bartender was taking too long.

21:55.940 --> 21:56.858
For you.

21:57.442 --> 21:58.651
Really?

21:59.402 --> 22:02.947
This didn't come from a box of martinis
you bought me four years ago?

22:03.031 --> 22:04.824
Just made. I promise.

22:04.907 --> 22:06.242
Then thank you.

22:06.326 --> 22:07.994
You're welcome.

22:08.077 --> 22:10.163
[Peter] Wow. Frankie's a better artist
than I thought.

22:10.246 --> 22:11.289
[Judy] Indeed.

22:11.372 --> 22:14.375
[Peter] It really does kind of capture
Grace now, doesn't it?

22:14.459 --> 22:15.877
[Judy] It's just so sad, though.

22:15.960 --> 22:18.296
I mean, I used to envy her.
We all did.

22:18.379 --> 22:19.672
She had everything.

22:19.756 --> 22:23.634
Now she has to work so hard to prove
she didn't end up like this.

22:23.718 --> 22:25.178
Yeah, it's a real shame.

22:25.261 --> 22:26.262
Poor Grace.

22:29.474 --> 22:32.894
Oh, excuse me.
I'm so glad you're enjoying Frankie's art,

22:32.977 --> 22:37.148
but if you could perhaps
keep the cruelty to a minimum.

22:38.441 --> 22:39.942
I-- [sighs]

22:40.026 --> 22:41.986
-We didn't mean--
-Don't even.

22:42.070 --> 22:43.905
Come on.

22:46.991 --> 22:48.117
Thank you.

22:49.202 --> 22:50.244
You okay?

22:50.328 --> 22:51.996
Yeah, I'm great.

22:53.414 --> 22:55.458
They don't know anything about you.

22:55.541 --> 22:56.709
Or maybe they do.

22:56.793 --> 22:58.336
What are you talking about?

22:58.419 --> 23:00.630
Your things are better than my things.

23:00.713 --> 23:04.383
And Brianna just told me
you've got a big loan all lined up.

23:05.009 --> 23:07.512
Yeah, I lied.

23:07.595 --> 23:09.180
I lied to our daughter.

23:09.263 --> 23:10.640
We didn't get the loan.

23:10.723 --> 23:15.603
You will. And as I recall,
it took a few tries the last time, too.

23:17.396 --> 23:20.066
The last time I wasn't 73.

23:40.086 --> 23:41.587
[man clears throat]

23:43.631 --> 23:44.715
Mr. Loggins,

23:45.424 --> 23:48.094
I am so thrilled
that you came here tonight.

23:48.177 --> 23:50.972
I personally am especially moved.

23:51.055 --> 23:53.266
You did call me about 700 times.

23:53.349 --> 23:56.686
And you were very patient,
no matter how insistent I became.

23:56.769 --> 23:58.688
You know, I'm looking forward
to meeting Frankie tonight.

23:58.771 --> 24:00.773
I really like her stuff.

24:00.857 --> 24:02.775
Here's the thing, you can't come in.

24:02.859 --> 24:04.026
Excuse me?

24:04.110 --> 24:07.029
Your being here tonight
was the grand gesture I was looking for.

24:07.113 --> 24:09.323
It turns out it was actually too grand,

24:09.407 --> 24:13.953
and it would undermine my ex-wife's
newfound confidence as an artist.

24:14.036 --> 24:18.207
She's learning to follow her inner muse

24:18.291 --> 24:20.668
and she doesn't need validation
from you anymore.

24:20.751 --> 24:23.671
Which, you have to admit,
is really growth for her.

24:23.754 --> 24:25.423
What the fuck?

24:25.506 --> 24:28.176
I'm sorry. I really should have
listened to my husband.

24:28.259 --> 24:32.013
The truth is I've never been comfortable
with people being angry at me.

24:32.096 --> 24:36.559
And now that includes you, Kenny Loggins.

24:38.811 --> 24:41.397
Hi. Thank you.

24:43.316 --> 24:45.109
You're an artist, Mom.

24:46.277 --> 24:48.529
You're exactly what you wanted to be
when you grew up.

24:50.031 --> 24:51.991
I wish I could say the same.

24:52.783 --> 24:54.535
Oh, honey.

24:56.329 --> 24:58.831
Who's that man your father's talking to?

24:58.915 --> 25:00.291
Oh, my God!

25:00.374 --> 25:01.500
Oh!

25:01.584 --> 25:02.960
[softly] You've got to go!

25:03.044 --> 25:04.295
[Frankie] Oh, my God!

25:04.378 --> 25:05.755
Oh, was that--?! Was that--?!

25:05.838 --> 25:09.133
Yes, and I'm sorry I brought him here,
but I sent him away.

25:09.217 --> 25:11.510
[screams]
Why would you send him away?

25:11.594 --> 25:12.887
You said you didn't need him anymore!

25:12.970 --> 25:15.431
Nobody doesn't need Kenny Loggins!

25:15.514 --> 25:17.767
Oh, Sol, you are really
working my left teat.

25:17.850 --> 25:20.811
I can't win. I'm trying to
make things up to you and I can't win.

25:20.895 --> 25:25.066
No, you can't.
Maybe someday, but definitely not today.

25:25.149 --> 25:28.110
Kenny! Kenny!

25:41.916 --> 25:43.751
[sighs]

25:43.834 --> 25:45.670
It was sweet of you to try.

25:46.879 --> 25:48.631
It was sweet of you to come.

25:50.174 --> 25:51.467
I know.

25:57.056 --> 25:59.517
Can I go home and put on my pajamas?

26:00.226 --> 26:02.436
Can I go home and put on my noose?

26:02.979 --> 26:04.563
What's your damage?

26:04.647 --> 26:08.401
I didn't sell a painting
to Kenny Loggins... twice.

26:10.152 --> 26:11.237
See that woman over there?

26:11.320 --> 26:15.658
She's been staring at that painting
for a good two-and-a-half martinis.

26:15.741 --> 26:17.618
And I've been pacing myself.

26:21.205 --> 26:22.540
What?

26:22.873 --> 26:23.874
Go over there.

26:25.209 --> 26:26.043
Go!

26:34.510 --> 26:37.680
I heard you've been spending
some time with this piece.

26:37.888 --> 26:42.643
This reminds me of a painting
that was in the house that I grew up in.

26:43.060 --> 26:46.147
It's not the actual painting,
but it's the memory of it,

26:46.230 --> 26:49.108
and it brings me back to a happy time.

26:49.191 --> 26:50.484
Oh, wow.

26:50.568 --> 26:52.570
And the yellow makes me feel hopeful.

26:53.946 --> 26:58.159
Really? I just put the yellow in
because my ex-husband hates mustard.

26:58.826 --> 27:01.746
-But I like your interpretation better.
-Hm.

27:02.580 --> 27:04.498
Would you like to take
the happy time home with you?

27:04.582 --> 27:07.543
You know, I really would,
but I can't afford it.

27:08.836 --> 27:09.754
How much you got?

27:15.718 --> 27:19.388
