100. Oh!

00:15.390 --> 00:17.684
The perfect number of guests
for what will no doubt be

00:17.726 --> 00:19.144
the perfect wedding.

00:19.185 --> 00:21.813
Yay. Ooh, although we do have
one outstanding invite.

00:21.855 --> 00:24.190
I didn't get an RSVP
from Mr. Dexter's father yet.

00:24.232 --> 00:25.859
Surely that's an oversight.

00:25.900 --> 00:27.569
I'll speak to Dex about it
when he arrives.

00:27.610 --> 00:29.112
Perfect.
The wait is over.

00:29.154 --> 00:32.282
He's here.
Perfect timing, as always.

00:32.323 --> 00:34.409
I aim to please.

00:34.451 --> 00:35.535
Hold on a minute.

00:35.577 --> 00:37.162
Are you planning
some sort of party here?

00:37.203 --> 00:39.039
I certainly hope I'm invited.

00:39.080 --> 00:39.706
Try guest of honor.

00:39.706 --> 00:42.042
Although you do have to share
top billing with me.

00:42.083 --> 00:43.585
Um...

00:43.626 --> 00:47.672
we have not gotten
an RSVP from Samir.

00:47.714 --> 00:50.091
Your father is coming,
isn't he?

00:50.133 --> 00:52.469
Well, I wouldn't bet on it.

00:52.969 --> 00:56.014
We kind of had a falling out
a few years back.

00:56.056 --> 00:58.808
What do you mean?
Let's just say, when I chose
to leave the family business

00:58.850 --> 01:01.561
to start my own hedge fund,
it didn't go over so well.

01:01.603 --> 01:04.230
I'm so sorry.
I had no idea.

01:04.272 --> 01:06.149
Why haven't you
mentioned this before?

01:06.191 --> 01:08.818
Sort of a sore subject,
I guess.

01:08.860 --> 01:10.361
But, you know what,

01:10.403 --> 01:12.030
if he doesn't want to be here
for our special day,

01:12.072 --> 01:13.364
that's on him.

01:13.406 --> 01:16.159
Because tomorrow is about us.

01:22.457 --> 01:25.210
So, if we choose you
to be our surrogate,

01:25.251 --> 01:28.129
is there anything else
that we should know now?

01:28.171 --> 01:29.756
No, that's it.

01:29.798 --> 01:32.550
Except no weekend birth.

01:32.592 --> 01:33.760
I've got a life, you know.

01:33.802 --> 01:34.761
(clears throat)

01:34.803 --> 01:36.638
Thank you for coming,

01:36.679 --> 01:38.848
and we'll let the service know
if we want to move forward.

01:40.892 --> 01:42.393
Oh, my God.

01:42.435 --> 01:44.896
I mean, she's the 15th woman
we've seen this morning,

01:44.938 --> 01:46.314
and she's supposed to be
the best?

01:46.356 --> 01:47.774
Now I know how
The Bachelor feels.

01:47.816 --> 01:50.360
I just didn't think
this would be so exhausting.

01:50.401 --> 01:51.069
Liam, I'm sorry.

01:51.069 --> 01:54.114
I know these past few weeks
have been brutal for you.

01:54.155 --> 01:56.157
And to be honest,
after your mom died,

01:56.199 --> 01:57.867
I wasn't sure if you wanted
to go through with it.

01:57.909 --> 01:59.661
Of course I do.

01:59.702 --> 02:02.413
I mean, yeah, my mom dying
was rough, but, Fallon,

02:02.455 --> 02:05.792
our relationship died
long before that.

02:05.834 --> 02:07.669
You know, it's been a while
since my dad passed,

02:07.710 --> 02:09.963
and I barely speak to my sister.

02:10.004 --> 02:13.383
I want to start a new family.
Okay? With you.

02:13.424 --> 02:15.385
Yeah?
Yeah.

02:15.426 --> 02:18.096
So, come on, we can do this.

02:18.138 --> 02:20.306
Okay.
(door opens)

02:20.348 --> 02:22.058
Hi.

02:22.100 --> 02:26.229
Hi. Um... Stacey, is it?

02:26.271 --> 02:29.774
Yes. Stacey Moore, as in
I always want more carbs.

02:29.816 --> 02:30.775
(chuckles)
But with two Os.

02:30.817 --> 02:33.027
By the way, I love your dog.

02:33.069 --> 02:33.570
Okay, you know what, Stacey,

02:33.611 --> 02:36.614
let's just save ourselves
some time

02:36.656 --> 02:38.241
and skip right to
your list of demands.

02:38.283 --> 02:39.868
My demands?
Yeah.

02:39.909 --> 02:41.161
No, I'm here for you.

02:43.037 --> 02:44.706
I'm single,
with a 14-year-old son

02:44.747 --> 02:46.166
who is away at boarding school.

02:46.207 --> 02:48.459
I know, how could someone
so youthful looking

02:48.501 --> 02:50.378
have a 14-year-old?
Well, let's just say

02:50.420 --> 02:51.880
I enjoyed my freshman year
at Brown

02:51.921 --> 02:53.631
a little bit too much.

02:53.673 --> 02:56.301
But needing to provide for him
just made me work harder,

02:56.342 --> 02:59.846
and I went on to get my PhD
in paleontology,

02:59.888 --> 03:02.932
and now I'm an adviser
at the Natural History Museum.

03:02.974 --> 03:03.516
Anything else?

03:03.558 --> 03:08.396
Yeah. No, no, no.
I mean, um, thank you.

03:08.438 --> 03:09.439
I'm sorry, was that too much?

03:09.480 --> 03:10.899
No.
No, no.

03:10.940 --> 03:13.860
No, we, uh, we've just met
a lot of women today

03:13.902 --> 03:14.861
who weren't, uh,

03:14.903 --> 03:16.821
well... like you.
Like you.

03:16.863 --> 03:20.575
Look, uh, you can read all
my medical info in the bio,

03:20.617 --> 03:24.370
but I want you to know that
this isn't just about me;

03:24.412 --> 03:25.079
it's a partnership.

03:25.121 --> 03:28.208
And I will do whatever it
takes to make you comfortable.

03:28.249 --> 03:31.628
Oh, except give up my heels.

03:31.669 --> 03:33.588
The Manolos stay on
until my water breaks.

03:33.630 --> 03:35.632
I hope that's okay.

03:35.673 --> 03:36.966
ADAM:
Hello? Bridget Jones?

03:37.008 --> 03:39.010
I need to talk to you
right now.

03:39.052 --> 03:40.887
(knocking continuously)

03:40.929 --> 03:42.555
Something the matter?

03:42.597 --> 03:45.016
I just read my chief of staff
exit paperwork.

03:45.058 --> 03:47.101
Congratulations, you're
at year-nine reading level.

03:47.143 --> 03:49.312
Enjoy the day.
I'm not signing.

03:49.354 --> 03:53.066
A 20% pay cut? Restricted
access to hospital records?

03:53.107 --> 03:53.775
Uh, y-you got to
be kidding me.

03:53.816 --> 03:56.611
No, I'm quite serious.
And if you don't sign it soon,

03:56.653 --> 03:59.155
I will have your hospital
credentials revoked entirely.

03:59.197 --> 04:01.241
So, if you'll excuse me...

04:01.282 --> 04:02.450
No, hey, I'm not finished.

04:02.492 --> 04:03.910
Yes, you are.
Bye-bye now.

04:05.828 --> 04:07.455
Do you think he knew
I was in here?

04:07.497 --> 04:09.916
I doubt it. He's too
focused on himself, as usual.

04:09.958 --> 04:11.960
I can't believe I have
to sit next to him

04:12.001 --> 04:13.670
at Alexis's wedding tomorrow.

04:13.711 --> 04:16.631
Well, I could come with you,
you know, as your plus-one.

04:16.673 --> 04:18.091
Well, Alexis is gonna
lose her mind

04:18.132 --> 04:19.634
when she finds out
we're seeing each other,

04:19.676 --> 04:22.178
so I don't think it's
an ideal wedding gift.

04:22.220 --> 04:25.431
Hmm, yeah, that would be
more a gift for me, wouldn't it?

04:25.473 --> 04:26.182
Mm.

04:26.182 --> 04:28.685
Maybe it's time to start
telling people we're a couple.

04:30.436 --> 04:31.854
Not yet.

04:31.896 --> 04:33.106
Please? I just--

04:33.147 --> 04:34.607
I'm really enjoying
what we have.

04:34.649 --> 04:36.776
Once everyone knows, just,

04:36.818 --> 04:39.112
people will undoubtedly
make things unpleasant for us.

04:39.153 --> 04:41.447
And by people,
I mean Alexis and Adam.

04:41.489 --> 04:42.907
I get that.

04:42.949 --> 04:45.493
What if I come with you
to London next week?

04:45.535 --> 04:47.161
We don't have to hide there.

04:47.203 --> 04:47.912
I'm, like, only going
to get my visa renewed.

04:47.912 --> 04:51.666
It's not like a vacation.
I'm staying in an airport hotel.

04:51.708 --> 04:52.834
You're a Carrington.

04:52.875 --> 04:53.376
I think that goes against

04:53.418 --> 04:55.628
the family code of honor
or something.

04:55.670 --> 04:57.130
Well, what can I say?
I'm just saving all my

04:57.171 --> 04:58.673
five-star accommodations
for a trip

04:58.715 --> 05:00.425
with my new girlfriend.

05:00.466 --> 05:02.427
Oh, my God.

05:05.805 --> 05:07.557
BLAKE:
How's the, um,
surrogate search going?

05:07.598 --> 05:09.350
We found a great candidate
this morning.

05:09.392 --> 05:12.478
After a standard CIA, FBI
and Twitter background check,

05:12.520 --> 05:14.439
I'm hoping we can
make a deal.

05:14.480 --> 05:15.064
Well, I am glad to hear it.

05:15.064 --> 05:18.526
Hey, speaking of new deals,
I just read that

05:18.568 --> 05:20.069
Tempo Universal Streaming

05:20.111 --> 05:21.904
is gonna be acquired
by BlueStar.

05:21.946 --> 05:23.281
I thought you wanted
to buy them.
I did.

05:23.323 --> 05:26.409
I mean, I do.
I submitted a bid.

05:26.451 --> 05:27.910
One which I thought
was accepted.

05:27.952 --> 05:29.829
And so it begins.
Excuse me?

05:29.871 --> 05:31.748
And so what begins?
The adjustment.

05:31.789 --> 05:33.249
You're starting a family.

05:33.291 --> 05:35.084
And so it's shifted
your focus

05:35.126 --> 05:36.544
and left you a
little bit, um,

05:36.586 --> 05:38.921
preoccupied.
I'm sorry.

05:38.963 --> 05:41.424
Are you saying I dropped
the ball on this?

05:41.466 --> 05:43.176
Happens all the time
with women in business

05:43.217 --> 05:44.218
when they start a family.

05:44.260 --> 05:45.720
They miss a few meetings,

05:45.762 --> 05:47.430
forget to return calls.

05:47.472 --> 05:49.182
They lose their edge.
Seen it a million times.

05:49.223 --> 05:51.434
Thank you for
that condescendingly sexist

05:51.476 --> 05:54.395
assessment, but as usual,
you couldn't be more wrong.

05:54.437 --> 05:56.564
If you say so.
I know so.
I'm gonna show everyone

05:56.606 --> 05:59.150
that I can start a family,
remain a force in business,

05:59.192 --> 06:01.819
and that Fallon Carrington
is still full of...

06:02.570 --> 06:04.030
...edge.

06:04.072 --> 06:06.074
You know what I mean.
Move.

06:09.827 --> 06:12.038
Who puts champagne
on their wedding registry?

06:12.080 --> 06:14.582
Oh, honey, this is
the same woman that registered

06:14.624 --> 06:17.168
at Aston Martin
when she married Jeff.

06:17.210 --> 06:18.961
I have to get her something.

06:19.003 --> 06:20.963
Having been married
to Alexis, might I suggest

06:21.005 --> 06:23.549
noise-canceling headphones
for Dex?

06:23.591 --> 06:25.134
(chuckles)
Mm. Good morning.

06:26.511 --> 06:27.637
Jeanette brought
this box out for you.

06:27.678 --> 06:28.763
It was delivered
this morning.

06:28.805 --> 06:31.099
This must be my vintage
model airplane

06:31.140 --> 06:32.809
I bought at auction.

06:32.850 --> 06:35.561
I thought it might look good
on my desk at the office.

06:38.648 --> 06:41.692
What the hell?

06:41.734 --> 06:42.985
I think you may have
overpaid.

06:43.027 --> 06:44.320
Blake, I'm so sorry.

06:44.362 --> 06:45.988
It must have broken
during shipping.

06:46.030 --> 06:47.907
This isn't a model airplane.

06:50.618 --> 06:53.037
This is the Carrington
family crest.

06:53.079 --> 06:56.374
Didn't that go missing
months ago from the compound?
Yeah.

06:56.416 --> 06:59.168
Now it's been destroyed.
Somebody ripped it apart,

06:59.210 --> 07:00.294
set fire to it.

07:00.336 --> 07:01.712
Who would do something
like that?

07:04.006 --> 07:07.009
Someone who's declaring war
on this family.

07:07.051 --> 07:09.095
♪ ♪

07:31.242 --> 07:32.827
Bruce, so good to see you.

07:32.869 --> 07:34.579
Here. Sit, sit, sit.

07:34.620 --> 07:36.330
You like your whiskey neat,
right?

07:36.372 --> 07:38.332
Listen...
So I heard a nasty rumor

07:38.374 --> 07:41.961
that you are planning on selling
Tempo Universal Streaming

07:42.003 --> 07:43.504
to BlueStar, but then
I thought to myself,

07:43.546 --> 07:46.174
that can't be true because
we had a handshake deal, right?

07:46.215 --> 07:47.925
Well, we had
a tentative deal, yes,

07:47.967 --> 07:49.635
but the landscape has changed
since...

07:49.677 --> 07:50.928
Yeah, no, don't I know it.

07:50.970 --> 07:52.847
It's just that I promised
my board

07:52.889 --> 07:55.475
that I would shore up our
South American music footprint.

07:55.516 --> 07:58.311
And buying Tempo Universal was
a big part of that, Bruce.

07:58.352 --> 07:59.604
I understand that, it's just...

07:59.645 --> 08:01.522
Just imagine how foolish
I would feel

08:01.564 --> 08:04.484
if I had to go back to them and
tell them that the deal was off.

08:04.525 --> 08:07.028
Fallon, they came in
with a higher offer.

08:07.069 --> 08:08.821
I tried to reach you
for a counter,

08:08.863 --> 08:12.325
but you didn't return
my calls.

08:12.366 --> 08:15.244
Well, you certainly have
my attention now,

08:15.286 --> 08:17.246
and I can afford to up my offer,

08:17.288 --> 08:18.831
so how much are we talking?

08:18.873 --> 08:22.084
They offered to pay $50 million
more than Fallon Unlimited.

08:22.126 --> 08:25.630
Okay, well, I can't afford that.

08:25.671 --> 08:28.716
I mean, my board barely approved
the initial 100.

08:28.758 --> 08:30.801
Fallon, I'm sorry.

08:30.843 --> 08:34.639
I hope you understand
it's, it's just business.

08:38.100 --> 08:40.269
MICHAEL:
Thank you very much.
Michael.

08:40.311 --> 08:44.148
Just the person I wanted to see.
(sighs)

08:44.190 --> 08:45.399
I need a favor.

08:45.441 --> 08:47.151
Four words that send
a shiver down my spine.

08:47.193 --> 08:49.904
Hush now. The deadline
for portfolio submissions

08:49.946 --> 08:51.447
at NordicStar is in two days,

08:51.489 --> 08:54.825
but I feel mine is still lacking
some je ne sais quoi.

08:54.867 --> 08:56.994
How about you je ne sais
what you need from me?

08:57.036 --> 08:59.038
I want to include
my celebrity looks

08:59.080 --> 09:00.831
as part of a digital section.

09:00.873 --> 09:03.000
The wardrobe I designed
for Janelle Crowley

09:03.042 --> 09:04.669
in the movie would be perfect.

09:04.710 --> 09:07.129
All I need is some footage.

09:07.171 --> 09:08.756
Ooh, no can do.

09:08.798 --> 09:10.174
Nina won't release
any footage

09:10.216 --> 09:11.551
until she finishes
her rough cut.

09:11.592 --> 09:13.678
When will that be?
Not for a few more weeks.

09:13.719 --> 09:15.304
But I don't have
a few more weeks.

09:15.346 --> 09:17.348
Surely she'll make
an exception for me.

09:17.390 --> 09:18.641
You don't know Nina
like I do.

09:18.683 --> 09:21.394
Making exceptions is not
the way she rolls.

09:21.435 --> 09:23.521
But maybe I could get you
some of the still photos

09:23.563 --> 09:24.522
that we took on set.

09:24.564 --> 09:25.565
I already have those.

09:25.606 --> 09:26.691
Michael, I am going up against

09:26.732 --> 09:28.025
hundreds of other submissions.

09:28.067 --> 09:29.819
I need mine to stand out.

09:29.860 --> 09:31.404
I really wish
I could help you,

09:31.445 --> 09:33.990
but you're gonna have to
make do with what you have.

09:34.031 --> 09:36.158
I'm sure it's great.

09:38.035 --> 09:39.328
Samir, thank you for coming.

09:39.370 --> 09:39.954
I would have invited
you to the penthouse,

09:39.996 --> 09:43.666
but Dex is there,
and, well, I thought it best

09:43.708 --> 09:45.376
that we speak in private.

09:45.418 --> 09:47.670
Yes, probably for the best.

09:47.712 --> 09:51.257
Um, the thing is,

09:51.299 --> 09:54.093
family is so
important to Dex.

09:54.135 --> 09:55.469
I know how much
it would mean to him

09:55.511 --> 09:57.096
to have his father
at the wedding.

09:57.138 --> 10:00.141
I'm sure it would, but
under the circumstances

10:00.182 --> 10:01.684
I don't think that's
the best idea.

10:01.726 --> 10:04.979
It pains me to think that
just because Dex chose

10:05.021 --> 10:06.314
his own path in business,

10:06.355 --> 10:08.399
that you would
stay angry with him.

10:08.441 --> 10:10.026
I think you must be confused.

10:10.067 --> 10:12.486
I have no problem
with my son's success.

10:12.528 --> 10:14.530
It is you I take issue with.

10:14.572 --> 10:16.365
Me?!
Yes.

10:16.407 --> 10:19.410
You create a firestorm
of drama and chaos

10:19.452 --> 10:19.952
wherever you go.

10:19.994 --> 10:23.039
I assume that's why
you invited me here,

10:23.080 --> 10:26.167
to explain away some of your
abhorrent behavior in the past.

10:26.208 --> 10:30.212
I assure you I have no idea
to what you are referring.

10:30.254 --> 10:32.465
Alexis, please.

10:32.506 --> 10:34.467
Blake and I go back decades.

10:34.508 --> 10:37.261
I've heard the horror stories
of what you did to him

10:37.303 --> 10:39.513
during your marriage
and divorce.

10:39.555 --> 10:41.349
Obviously things can
get a bit contentious

10:41.390 --> 10:43.559
during a divorce,
and I also assure you

10:43.601 --> 10:46.812
that whatever Blake said
was an exaggeration.

10:46.854 --> 10:49.273
You set fire to his Monet.

10:49.315 --> 10:51.400
Who knew oil paintings
were so flammable?
(chuckles)

10:51.442 --> 10:53.944
You threw his exotic fish
collection in the pool.

10:53.986 --> 10:55.655
Their bowl was dirty.

10:55.696 --> 10:58.115
You untethered his yacht
and let it drift out to sea.

10:58.157 --> 10:58.741
That is not true.

10:58.741 --> 11:01.410
I would never harm
the Carrington Cruiser.

11:01.452 --> 11:03.371
I christened her myself.

11:03.412 --> 11:07.792
(sighs) Alexis, you have
no tact, no decorum.

11:07.833 --> 11:11.087
I don't want my son subjected
to a life full of insanity.

11:13.339 --> 11:17.009
Samir, that's not who I am.

11:17.051 --> 11:19.804
Come to the wedding,
see for yourself.

11:19.845 --> 11:21.639
I love Dex.

11:21.681 --> 11:24.517
I want to make him happy,
and I know you do, too.

11:24.558 --> 11:26.477
So for his sake, please

11:26.519 --> 11:29.188
give me a chance
to prove myself.

11:33.818 --> 11:35.152
I just got off the phone
with Winston

11:35.194 --> 11:35.820
at the Carrington compound.

11:35.861 --> 11:38.823
He confirmed the crest has
been missing for months.

11:38.864 --> 11:40.991
Long-term grudges
are so exhausting.

11:41.033 --> 11:42.201
Who has the time?

11:42.243 --> 11:43.577
Clearly someone
with a vicious vendetta

11:43.619 --> 11:45.663
against this family;
the question is who?

11:45.705 --> 11:46.372
CRISTAL:
Beto's in Mexico.

11:46.414 --> 11:49.375
BLAKE:
Apparently, Nikolai Dimitrov
has been in mourning

11:49.417 --> 11:50.668
since his pet parrot
was killed.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.545
Jeff relocated Chief Stansfield
to the Bahamas

11:52.586 --> 11:54.088
and took his passport.
BLAKE:
Moldavian kings,

11:54.130 --> 11:54.797
they don't send
warnings first.

11:54.839 --> 11:58.050
Melissa Daniels is in the middle
of her third divorce.

11:58.092 --> 12:00.344
Who's Ted Dinard?

12:00.386 --> 12:02.555
Some bozo I tried to pay off
to stop seeing Steven.

12:02.596 --> 12:04.598
CRISTAL:
Caleb moved to a parish
in Sicily.

12:04.640 --> 12:06.100
Evan Tate is still behind bars.

12:06.142 --> 12:07.351
Senator North
doesn't have the spine

12:07.393 --> 12:08.853
to mess with me again.

12:08.894 --> 12:10.438
CRISTAL:
Where does that leave us?

12:10.479 --> 12:11.981
I'm afraid,
right where we started.

12:12.022 --> 12:14.024
No possible suspects.

12:14.066 --> 12:15.192
Or are we?

12:15.234 --> 12:17.820
There's one person
we haven't thought of.

12:17.862 --> 12:19.280
Yes, I understand.

12:19.321 --> 12:21.115
Ms. Carrington's suite
at the Savoy London

12:21.157 --> 12:21.657
has been confirmed.

12:21.699 --> 12:26.328
I'll pass along the message.
Thank you.

12:26.370 --> 12:28.205
Is Fallon going to London?

12:28.247 --> 12:29.749
Oh, no, that was for Amanda.

12:29.790 --> 12:33.043
Wait, Amanda booked a suite
at the Savoy?
Mm-hmm.

12:33.085 --> 12:34.920
That's exciting.

12:34.962 --> 12:36.881
Dare I ask why that's
particularly exciting to you?

12:36.922 --> 12:40.342
Well, it sounds like she's
planning a great trip,

12:40.384 --> 12:43.345
and maybe that trip involves
someone special in her life.

12:43.387 --> 12:45.514
Or maybe she's planning
on hooking up with someone.

12:45.556 --> 12:48.893
Lord knows she prattles on
about that ex of hers.

12:48.934 --> 12:51.562
Uh... what's her name?
Fanny, Frieda...

12:51.604 --> 12:52.813
It's Florence.

12:52.855 --> 12:54.190
Whatever.

12:54.231 --> 12:55.900
Sounds like they've
rekindled things.

12:55.941 --> 12:57.610
Oh, I highly doubt that.

12:57.651 --> 12:59.320
No, I have a feeling
there's someone else

12:59.361 --> 13:01.655
very special in her life. Hmm.

13:05.993 --> 13:07.203
How was that?

13:07.244 --> 13:09.163
That was great, Dina.

13:09.205 --> 13:10.706
Okay.

13:10.748 --> 13:12.291
I just forgot
to take Kirby's

13:12.333 --> 13:15.044
unwavering self-confidence
into account.

13:21.967 --> 13:23.886
Blake Carrington,
we need to talk.

13:23.928 --> 13:25.012
Really?

13:25.054 --> 13:26.680
Because last time you were here,

13:26.722 --> 13:28.849
you vowed revenge on my life.

13:28.891 --> 13:30.100
Yes, well,
things have changed.

13:30.142 --> 13:30.684
I need your help,

13:30.684 --> 13:33.938
and revenge has to take
second position.

13:33.979 --> 13:35.815
Samir Dexter hates me
because of the horrible things

13:35.856 --> 13:37.733
you said about me
during our divorce.

13:37.775 --> 13:40.486
I need you to tell him they were
lies of a heartbroken man.

13:40.528 --> 13:43.113
One problem with that:
they were all true.

13:43.155 --> 13:46.075
They were not. I never sent
the Carrington Cruiser adrift.

13:46.116 --> 13:47.743
Sure you did,
during Hurricane Floyd,

13:47.785 --> 13:49.495
I might add.

13:49.537 --> 13:51.872
The wreckage washed up on shore
in Wilmington?

13:51.914 --> 13:53.624
That does sound
vaguely familiar.

13:53.666 --> 13:56.627
Nice talk.
Are we finished here?
Not quite.

13:56.669 --> 13:57.837
I need you to come
to the wedding.

13:57.878 --> 13:59.463
You and Samir are good friends.

13:59.505 --> 14:01.757
If you're there, you can get him
to change his mind about me.

14:01.799 --> 14:02.967
Not interested.

14:03.008 --> 14:04.009
Blake, please.

14:04.051 --> 14:05.177
I want to start my marriage off

14:05.219 --> 14:06.262
on the right foot.

14:06.303 --> 14:08.138
This may come as a surprise
to you,

14:08.180 --> 14:09.890
but your happy marriage,
not high

14:09.932 --> 14:11.308
on my priorities list.

14:11.350 --> 14:12.601
Think of it this way.

14:12.643 --> 14:13.227
If I'm happily married,

14:13.269 --> 14:16.146
the less time I will have
to ruin your life.

14:16.188 --> 14:18.774
Okay, Cristal and I will come.
Mm-hmm.

14:18.816 --> 14:20.734
On one condition.

14:20.776 --> 14:23.279
You start shipping all your
Alexam product through PPA.

14:23.320 --> 14:26.073
Only you could find a way
to profit off of my wedding.

14:26.115 --> 14:28.576
Deal. But I expect results.

14:29.118 --> 14:31.829
I am so desperate.
Bruce Fontaine just pulled

14:31.871 --> 14:33.414
the deal on Tempo Universal,

14:33.455 --> 14:35.082
and now the board
won't approve more money

14:35.124 --> 14:35.666
so that I can up my offer.

14:35.708 --> 14:38.210
So I'm guessing we're not
going for coffee?

14:38.252 --> 14:39.920
And as if the day
couldn't get any worse,

14:39.962 --> 14:41.422
I ran into Pepper Channing
at lunch,

14:41.463 --> 14:44.174
who was shocked to hear
that the surrogacy service

14:44.216 --> 14:44.758
didn't have us meet
with Tiffany.

14:44.800 --> 14:47.511
I'm sure I'm gonna hate myself
for this,

14:47.553 --> 14:49.179
but who's Tiffany?

14:49.221 --> 14:52.808
Tiffany is the A-list surrogate
in Atlanta right now.

14:52.850 --> 14:55.644
Apparently her uterine wall is
stronger than titanium.

14:55.686 --> 14:57.730
Okay, well, maybe
she wasn't available.
No.

14:57.771 --> 14:59.523
That's not it at all.
I called the service,

14:59.565 --> 15:01.525
and apparently they didn't
send us her bio

15:01.567 --> 15:03.110
because they felt
it wasn't a match.

15:03.152 --> 15:04.361
Which I'm not buying.

15:04.403 --> 15:05.571
This is exactly
like Bruce Fontaine.

15:05.613 --> 15:06.947
They are trying to screw us.

15:06.989 --> 15:08.824
I don't think it's exactly
like Bruce Fontaine.

15:08.866 --> 15:10.951
They picked the wrong day
to mess with Fallon Carrington.

15:10.993 --> 15:12.244
Because I'm gonna make sure

15:12.286 --> 15:13.913
that we get Tiffany
as our surrogate

15:13.954 --> 15:15.706
if it's the last thing
that I do.

15:15.748 --> 15:17.666
Okay, if you want to
use Tiffany, that's fine.

15:17.708 --> 15:19.501
But maybe we should
meet her first?

15:19.543 --> 15:20.628
Yeah, you're right.

15:20.669 --> 15:22.171
I mean, I would like
to hear more about

15:22.212 --> 15:22.838
her freakishly strong uterus.

15:22.838 --> 15:25.257
We'll set a meeting, okay?
Any night but Thursday.

15:25.299 --> 15:27.426
I have dinner with my agent
to talk about a new book deal.

15:27.468 --> 15:29.803
Now, he thinks I can get...
Liam, you're a genius.

15:29.845 --> 15:32.139
Yes, an agent is
exactly what I need

15:32.181 --> 15:34.600
to get Tempo Universal back.

15:34.642 --> 15:37.937
So we're back to you now.
Got it.

15:37.978 --> 15:40.064
Hello.

15:40.105 --> 15:43.484
Wow, beautiful.
I love Juliet roses.

15:43.525 --> 15:44.193
These just came for Amanda.

15:44.193 --> 15:47.738
CRISTAL:
Oh, I wonder who
the secret admirer is.

15:47.780 --> 15:49.073
KIRBY:
Let's find out.

15:52.743 --> 15:56.163
"Can't wait to see you
in London. XOXO"

15:56.205 --> 15:58.832
Oh, the admirer remains
a secret.

15:58.874 --> 16:02.419
I should let Amanda know
that these arrived.

16:02.461 --> 16:03.796
Honestly, Dom,
you have a lot

16:03.837 --> 16:05.631
of solid designs here
to choose from.

16:05.673 --> 16:07.508
Solid might not be enough.

16:07.549 --> 16:09.635
I need to somehow
get my portfolio

16:09.677 --> 16:11.887
on the top of the stack
at NordicStar.

16:11.929 --> 16:13.597
NordicStar Airlines?

16:13.639 --> 16:15.265
I didn't know all this
was for them.

16:15.307 --> 16:17.059
You're familiar
with the company?

16:17.101 --> 16:18.519
Since we launched PPA,
I've made it my business

16:18.560 --> 16:19.895
to know the marketplace.

16:19.937 --> 16:21.981
You know Samir Dexter sits
on the board over there.

16:22.022 --> 16:25.859
Dexter? As in Dex Dexter?

16:25.901 --> 16:28.487
Samir's his father.
What do you know about him?

16:28.529 --> 16:30.864
Not much.
He and Blake go way back.

16:30.906 --> 16:32.282
Apparently he's
pretty old-school.

16:32.324 --> 16:35.160
Are we talking
chivalrous old-school

16:35.202 --> 16:37.913
or boys' club kind of thing?

16:37.955 --> 16:39.081
Sadly, the latter.

16:39.123 --> 16:40.874
Loves a damsel in distress.

16:40.916 --> 16:43.210
I'm sure he'll be
at the wedding tomorrow,

16:43.252 --> 16:46.922
which I now have to attend
with Blake.

16:46.964 --> 16:48.757
I'm happy to put in
a good word.
Thanks.

16:48.799 --> 16:50.509
I'll let you know
if I need any help.

16:50.551 --> 16:51.135
KIRBY:
Amanda.

16:51.176 --> 16:54.847
Big bouquet of flowers
just arrived for you.

16:54.888 --> 16:57.766
Oh, lovely. From who?
Good question.

16:57.808 --> 17:02.021
The card says "Can't wait
to see you in London, XOXO."

17:02.062 --> 17:04.481
Any chance you've rekindled
with your ex-girlfriend Florence

17:04.523 --> 17:06.483
and forgot to tell
your current girlfriend Kirby?

17:06.525 --> 17:08.777
Okay, no, I haven't rekindled
anything with Florence.

17:08.819 --> 17:10.362
Will you lower your voice?

17:10.404 --> 17:11.864
Florence and I haven't
spoken in months.

17:11.905 --> 17:13.490
I have no idea why
she'd send flowers.

17:13.532 --> 17:14.867
Maybe 'cause you told her
you were going to London

17:14.908 --> 17:16.160
and wanted to have
a romantic getaway

17:16.201 --> 17:17.161
at a posh hotel.

17:17.202 --> 17:19.121
I called the Savoy myself

17:19.163 --> 17:20.372
and confirmed
your reservation.

17:20.414 --> 17:22.624
Okay, I never made
that reservation.

17:22.666 --> 17:25.335
I swear. Look, if Florence
even knew I was coming,

17:25.377 --> 17:27.463
I highly doubt she'd want
to get back together.

17:27.504 --> 17:28.881
Now I know why
you were so intent

17:28.922 --> 17:29.590
on keeping our relationship
a secret.

17:29.590 --> 17:32.468
Wouldn't want your real
girlfriend to find out, right?

17:32.509 --> 17:33.927
Okay, Kirby, this is
a misunderstanding.

17:33.969 --> 17:36.221
Save it.
Have fun at the wedding.

17:36.263 --> 17:40.017
Guess the lying apple doesn't
fall far from the lying tree.

17:40.059 --> 17:43.562
Kirby. Kirby!

17:54.990 --> 17:56.742
Sam?

17:57.826 --> 18:00.079
Claudia.
Hey.

18:00.120 --> 18:02.206
I called your parole officer.
She told me you're

18:02.247 --> 18:04.083
a corrections counselor now?

18:04.124 --> 18:05.959
Yeah.
(chuckles)

18:06.001 --> 18:06.710
I got to say I didn't
see that coming.

18:06.710 --> 18:10.714
Yeah, me neither. It's funny
how life can change, huh?

18:10.756 --> 18:12.674
Yeah.

18:12.716 --> 18:14.259
Well, enjoy the freedom
while it lasts,

18:14.301 --> 18:15.886
because I'm pretty sure
sending threatening packages

18:15.928 --> 18:18.347
to the Carringtons
violates your parole.

18:18.388 --> 18:18.931
Whoa, what are you
talking about?

18:18.931 --> 18:21.141
I would never do anything
crazy like that.

18:21.183 --> 18:24.269
Oh, but you, you would throw a
porcelain doll off a rooftop,

18:24.311 --> 18:26.230
knowing everyone thought
it was an actual baby?

18:26.271 --> 18:28.357
Okay, that was a different me.

18:28.398 --> 18:31.777
No, no, I've been working really
hard on my life, making amends.

18:31.819 --> 18:33.153
I mean, even trying to get

18:33.195 --> 18:34.613
visitation rights back
with my son.

18:34.655 --> 18:37.658
So you're not out to destroy
the Carringtons, then?

18:37.699 --> 18:39.493
No, absolutely not.

18:39.535 --> 18:42.579
I mean, in fact,
I'm, I'm grateful for them.

18:42.621 --> 18:43.997
Sending me to this
correction facility

18:44.039 --> 18:46.208
was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

18:47.167 --> 18:49.294
By the way, how's everyone?

18:49.336 --> 18:51.004
They're good, I guess.
Yeah?

18:51.046 --> 18:54.591
Yeah. They're all getting ready
for Alexis's wedding tomorrow.

18:54.633 --> 18:57.052
Oh, that's wonderful news.
How nice.

18:57.636 --> 19:01.682
All right, well, I, um... should
probably get back to work.

19:01.723 --> 19:03.267
Yeah.

19:03.308 --> 19:04.768
It was nice to see you.

19:04.810 --> 19:06.770
Mm-hmm.

19:07.729 --> 19:09.106
(car door opens, closes)

19:09.148 --> 19:11.191
(engine revs)

19:18.031 --> 19:19.491
Hey, it's me.

19:19.533 --> 19:21.243
Well, it looks like

19:21.285 --> 19:22.828
the Carringtons are all gonna be
in one place tomorrow.

19:22.870 --> 19:24.496
I'm gonna need your help.

19:30.127 --> 19:31.420
(smooth jazz playing)

19:31.461 --> 19:32.838
BOTH:
Thank you for coming.

19:32.880 --> 19:34.715
(laughing)

19:36.133 --> 19:38.343
Pop. What are you doing here?

19:38.385 --> 19:39.761
I believe

19:39.803 --> 19:41.680
I was invited.

19:41.722 --> 19:44.183
But if I received my invitation
by mistake, please let me know.

19:44.224 --> 19:46.476
No. Of course not.
It's just, um, I...

19:46.518 --> 19:47.895
Don't worry.

19:47.936 --> 19:49.730
I know why
your father didn't want to come.

19:49.771 --> 19:51.190
You do?

19:51.231 --> 19:53.317
Yes, and I love you for trying
to protect my feelings.

19:53.358 --> 19:56.195
But Samir and I
talked it out,

19:56.236 --> 19:57.946
and everything is fine now.

19:57.988 --> 19:59.531
(elevator bell dings)
Isn't that right, Samir?

19:59.573 --> 20:01.366
I'm here
for my son's wedding.

20:01.408 --> 20:03.410
BLAKE:
Samir!

20:03.452 --> 20:04.745
Blake Carrington.
Great to see you.

20:04.786 --> 20:06.747
This is my wife Cristal.

20:06.788 --> 20:08.498
Nice to meet you.
ALEXIS:
Blake?

20:12.127 --> 20:13.795
Just remember,

20:13.837 --> 20:16.381
tell him everything you said
about me back then was a lie.

20:16.423 --> 20:18.842
And, no, it doesn't matter
that it was true.

20:18.884 --> 20:21.720
Honesty is a luxury
I can't afford right now.

20:21.762 --> 20:23.722
Your future father-in-law
is a smart man.

20:23.764 --> 20:25.599
If I start talking
about how great you are

20:25.641 --> 20:28.769
on your wedding day,
he's gonna know something's up.

20:28.810 --> 20:30.229
I need to be subtle.

20:30.270 --> 20:31.772
I don't care how you do it.

20:31.813 --> 20:33.565
Get him to change his attitude
about me,

20:33.607 --> 20:35.609
or Alexam won't be shipping
one ounce of face cream

20:35.651 --> 20:37.194
through your airport.

20:38.278 --> 20:39.863
Florence, it's Amanda.

20:39.905 --> 20:41.490
Um, look, I don't know
how you found out

20:41.531 --> 20:42.908
I was coming to London,

20:42.950 --> 20:44.576
and I don't know why
you sent me flowers,

20:44.618 --> 20:46.828
but, uh, it needs to stop, okay?

20:46.870 --> 20:49.498
It's causing some serious
problems in my life.

20:49.539 --> 20:51.208
And just to be clear, uh,

20:51.250 --> 20:53.502
we will not be seeing each other
when I'm home, okay?

20:53.543 --> 20:54.962
Goodbye.

20:55.003 --> 20:56.838
You seem upset.

20:56.880 --> 20:59.091
(sighs)
Is there anything I can do?
Hors d'oeuvre?

20:59.132 --> 21:01.260
Yeah, you can take
your little canapé and go away.

21:01.301 --> 21:04.221
Now, now, we don't want
to let that cloudy attitude

21:04.263 --> 21:06.098
rain on Mother's
big day, do we?

21:06.139 --> 21:08.267
Luckily, I have
some very exciting news

21:08.308 --> 21:10.018
that will turn
that frown upside down.

21:10.060 --> 21:11.353
Somehow I doubt that.

21:11.395 --> 21:12.688
I returned
the signed exit paperwork

21:12.729 --> 21:14.481
like you asked.

21:14.523 --> 21:16.650
I have so many other exciting
things going on in life.

21:16.692 --> 21:18.318
Chief of staff was a burden.

21:18.360 --> 21:20.654
Okay, are we done now? Because
I could really use a drink.

21:20.696 --> 21:22.990
Whatever you have going on
in life,

21:23.031 --> 21:25.242
I'm sure it'll turn around soon.

21:25.284 --> 21:27.995
Or not.
I really don't care.

21:30.747 --> 21:33.250
What the hell is "FDAC"?

21:33.292 --> 21:34.584
I think
those are their initials.

21:34.626 --> 21:36.211
Oh, these'll be
collector's items

21:36.253 --> 21:38.630
once they get divorced.

21:38.672 --> 21:40.799
Well, what'd you find out?

21:40.841 --> 21:42.384
Someone else must have sent you
that mangled Carrington crest.

21:42.426 --> 21:43.885
I don't think it was Claudia.

21:43.927 --> 21:45.887
Why not?
She's turned
her life around.

21:45.929 --> 21:48.849
She was helping inmates
pick up trash.

21:48.890 --> 21:49.933
That's turning
your life around?

21:49.975 --> 21:51.184
And you're sure
it wasn't an act?

21:51.226 --> 21:52.978
Yes, I am sure.

21:53.020 --> 21:55.480
I even called the mental health
facility she had been at,

21:55.522 --> 21:57.774
and they told me she was doing
really great when she left.

21:57.816 --> 22:00.319
CRISTAL:
What about doctor-patient
confidentiality?

22:00.360 --> 22:02.487
BLAKE:
Claudia's doctor's
ethical breach is not really

22:02.529 --> 22:03.864
our main concern right now.

22:03.905 --> 22:05.991
If this really is a...
another dead end,

22:06.033 --> 22:08.201
we need to figure out who else
could be threatening us.

22:08.243 --> 22:10.287
Maybe it's a harmless stranger
who just

22:10.329 --> 22:13.165
doesn't like the Carringtons.
Yeah, I think she may be right.

22:13.206 --> 22:15.792
I mean, whoever sent the crest
didn't even ask for anything.

22:15.834 --> 22:17.461
BLAKE:
So, what, I'm just supposed
to forget about this?

22:17.502 --> 22:19.212
For now? Yes.

22:19.254 --> 22:20.547
Hello, Blake.

22:21.548 --> 22:22.674
It's good to see you again.

22:22.716 --> 22:24.593
I knew it.

22:24.634 --> 22:27.387
I can't believe
that I almost let this go.

22:27.429 --> 22:29.556
I can't believe
her therapist lied to me.

22:29.598 --> 22:31.516
I...
Claudia, wait!

22:31.558 --> 22:32.893
I have something for the bride.

22:32.934 --> 22:35.312
I... I'm confused.

22:35.354 --> 22:38.440
Uh, I-I wanted
to give a gift to Alexis

22:38.482 --> 22:40.442
(chuckles)
and wish her good luck.

22:40.484 --> 22:42.986
And since I knew
that you all would be here,

22:43.028 --> 22:44.988
I... (sighs)

22:45.030 --> 22:47.240
I came to make amends
and apologize.

22:54.998 --> 22:56.458
It's a mug?
I-I learned

22:56.500 --> 22:58.919
to make them in prison pottery.

22:58.960 --> 23:00.837
Would you make sure
that Alexis gets it for me?

23:00.879 --> 23:02.672
Sure.

23:02.714 --> 23:04.174
Thank you.

23:04.216 --> 23:07.511
Well, it was great
to see you all.

23:07.552 --> 23:08.720
Bye.

23:13.475 --> 23:15.435
Now might be a little tough.

23:15.477 --> 23:17.104
I'm sort of
at my mother's wedding,

23:17.145 --> 23:18.980
and I think she might
be offended if I missed it.

23:19.022 --> 23:20.399
Or she'll kill you.

23:20.440 --> 23:22.859
Hey, um, ask her

23:22.901 --> 23:26.196
if she can meet me in the lobby
of The Solitaire in 30 minutes.

23:26.238 --> 23:27.531
Great.

23:27.572 --> 23:29.074
Thank you, Jim.
And

23:29.116 --> 23:30.492
Jim is?

23:30.534 --> 23:31.952
Jim is a music agent.

23:31.993 --> 23:33.412
He reps a lot of big pop stars,

23:33.453 --> 23:35.372
including Frankie Chase,
who should be here soon.

23:35.414 --> 23:36.790
So I might need you
to cover for me

23:36.832 --> 23:38.375
in case the ceremony runs long.

23:38.417 --> 23:40.585
No, I'm not gonna cover for you.
Are you crazy?

23:40.627 --> 23:41.878
Of course she is.
She's my daughter.

23:41.920 --> 23:43.171
And my matron of honor.

23:43.213 --> 23:45.090
Okay, don't forget the rings.

23:45.132 --> 23:46.591
The ceremony is about
to start soon.

23:46.633 --> 23:49.010
Oh, good. Yeah,
let's get it rolling. I mean,

23:49.052 --> 23:50.804
you know, because
the sooner we get started,

23:50.846 --> 23:53.265
the sooner
you can enjoy your honeymoon.

23:53.306 --> 23:55.642
Why do I think
you have an agenda?
(elevator bell dings)

23:55.684 --> 23:57.185
Excuse me.

23:57.227 --> 23:59.271
I have to deal
with an uninvited guest.

24:00.939 --> 24:01.606
What are you doing here?

24:01.606 --> 24:04.276
I just need ten minutes
with the father of the groom.

24:04.317 --> 24:05.735
It can either be before
or after the ceremony.

24:05.777 --> 24:07.154
You won't even know I'm here.

24:07.195 --> 24:08.697
You're right,
because you won't be.

24:08.738 --> 24:09.948
I do not need anyone else

24:09.990 --> 24:11.533
offending Samir.

24:11.575 --> 24:13.952
And you are nothing
if not offensive.

24:13.994 --> 24:17.289
I'm going to chalk your rudeness
up to wedding-day jitters.

24:17.330 --> 24:18.498
I just need to chat

24:18.540 --> 24:20.709
about NordicStar
and give him my portfolio.

24:20.750 --> 24:22.419
No, you need to go.

24:22.461 --> 24:25.088
If you want me to leave,
you'll have to make a scene

24:25.130 --> 24:28.216
and throw me out,
which will ruin your wedding.

24:28.258 --> 24:30.886
(groans) Fine.

24:30.927 --> 24:33.889
But it is gauche to talk
business in public at a wedding,

24:33.930 --> 24:35.432
especially mine.

24:35.474 --> 24:37.184
Follow me.

24:38.143 --> 24:40.395
Okay, wait in here,

24:40.437 --> 24:42.939
and I'll go get
Samir for you.

24:50.614 --> 24:53.200
What the hell are you doing?!

24:53.241 --> 24:54.910
Making sure you can't get out!

24:54.951 --> 24:56.703
Your phone won't work.
(groans)

24:56.745 --> 24:58.205
But there's bottles of water
in the corner if you need it.

24:58.246 --> 24:59.706
Don't touch the wine!

24:59.748 --> 25:01.708
Got to run.

25:01.750 --> 25:05.212
(strings playing
Pachelbel's "Canon")
They're playing my song.

25:09.841 --> 25:11.468
And these two are
a wonderful example

25:11.510 --> 25:14.262
of how love can show up
when you least expect it.

25:14.304 --> 25:16.515
Love doesn't adhere
to a timetable.

25:16.556 --> 25:18.934
It reminds me of
the first couple I ever married.

25:18.975 --> 25:20.393
(Fallon clears throat)

25:20.435 --> 25:21.728
But

25:21.770 --> 25:23.355
that would be a story
for another day.

25:23.396 --> 25:25.899
So, we have
gathered here to join

25:25.941 --> 25:28.777
Farnsworth and Alexis
in the union of marriage.

25:28.818 --> 25:30.487
It is not a contract

25:30.529 --> 25:33.240
to be entered into lightly,
but seriously

25:33.281 --> 25:35.659
and with great
responsibility.

25:35.700 --> 25:37.035
So, do you, Farnsworth,

25:37.077 --> 25:38.787
take Alexis
to be your wife?

25:38.828 --> 25:40.747
Do you promise to love,
cherish and protect her

25:40.789 --> 25:42.832
for as long
as you both shall live?

25:42.874 --> 25:44.709
I sure do.

25:44.751 --> 25:47.712
Do you, Alexis, take Farnsworth
to be your husband?

25:47.754 --> 25:50.465
Do you promise to love,
cherish and protect him

25:50.507 --> 25:52.467
for as long
as you both shall live?

25:52.509 --> 25:53.927
You bet your ass I do.

25:53.969 --> 25:55.011
(laughter)

25:55.053 --> 25:56.596
You may exchange rings.

26:02.185 --> 26:05.313
And now, by the power vested
in me in the state of Georgia,

26:05.355 --> 26:06.856
I am honored

26:06.898 --> 26:08.275
to declare you married.

26:08.316 --> 26:10.860
You may seal the contract
with a kiss.

26:10.902 --> 26:13.196
(elevator bell dings)
(cheering, applause)

26:23.665 --> 26:25.166
Frankie?

26:25.208 --> 26:26.668
Hi. Uh,

26:26.710 --> 26:28.295
Fallon Carrington.
Nice to meet you.

26:28.336 --> 26:31.006
I was actually just about
to come meet you downstairs.

26:31.047 --> 26:32.549
The doorman told me
where I can find you,

26:32.591 --> 26:34.009
and since I don't really like
to wait, here I am.

26:34.050 --> 26:36.386
Okay, then, duly noted.
We can talk up here.

26:36.428 --> 26:38.972
So, I'm not sure what your agent
has told you about all this.

26:39.014 --> 26:40.974
He told me you have
an amazing deal to offer me,

26:41.016 --> 26:42.976
which is the only reason I came.

26:43.018 --> 26:45.520
I like to make money, so...
ALEXIS:
Oh, my gosh.

26:45.562 --> 26:48.148
This is the most
exciting thing ever.

26:48.189 --> 26:51.610
You bought a performance by
Frankie for my wedding gift!

26:51.651 --> 26:53.403
(gasps)
Yes!

26:53.445 --> 26:55.488
That's exactly
what's going on here.

26:55.530 --> 26:58.199
As a matter of fact,
Frankie and I and, uh...

26:58.241 --> 27:00.952
and those two are gonna go chat
about it in private,

27:00.994 --> 27:03.747
so don't you follow us
and ruin the surprise.

27:03.788 --> 27:04.873
Come with me.

27:04.914 --> 27:07.542
Alexis, congratulations.

27:08.960 --> 27:11.296
And welcome to the family.

27:11.338 --> 27:13.006
Thank you, Samir.

27:13.048 --> 27:15.508
You have no idea
how much that means to me.

27:15.550 --> 27:17.510
Of course, once Blake explained
all that chaos

27:17.552 --> 27:19.804
from when you two were married,
it made more sense.

27:19.846 --> 27:21.598
Oh, so he told you
none of that was true?

27:21.640 --> 27:23.850
This is what
I was talking about.

27:23.892 --> 27:25.143
SAMIR:
Right. Of course.

27:25.185 --> 27:26.561
Blake told me

27:26.603 --> 27:28.438
that all those events took place

27:28.480 --> 27:31.900
when you were going through
your, uh, alcoholic rage states.

27:31.941 --> 27:35.278
Oh, really?
That's what Blake told you?

27:37.030 --> 27:38.323
How thoughtful of him.

27:38.365 --> 27:40.367
I am just thrilled,
for my son's sake

27:40.408 --> 27:43.536
and yours as well, that
you have conquered your demons

27:43.578 --> 27:45.372
and put your life back together.

27:45.413 --> 27:48.124
As long as you don't,
uh, slide back

27:48.166 --> 27:50.627
into old habits,
everything should be fine.

27:50.669 --> 27:53.588
Oh, uh, what? This isn't mine.

27:53.630 --> 27:56.466
No. I-I was holding it for
Cristal, Blake's wife. (laughs)

27:56.508 --> 27:59.969
Guess there is just something
about being married to him

28:00.011 --> 28:02.347
that makes people want
to dull the pain.

28:05.517 --> 28:08.436
What are you doing in here?

28:08.478 --> 28:10.438
Do you know there was
a chair blocking the door?

28:10.480 --> 28:12.023
Yes, Fallon, I do.

28:12.065 --> 28:14.859
I may use it to smash
over your mother's head.

28:15.860 --> 28:17.946
Oh. (clears throat)

28:17.987 --> 28:20.532
Please ignore whatever that was.

28:20.573 --> 28:21.783
Where are we?
And can I leave now?

28:21.825 --> 28:24.244
Um, not just yet.
Can I please explain?

28:24.285 --> 28:26.246
You have three minutes.
Okay, good. I talk fast anyway.

28:26.287 --> 28:27.664
So, I know you are

28:27.706 --> 28:29.374
Tempo Universal
Streaming's biggest star.

28:29.416 --> 28:31.835
And good for you, girlfriend,
but that's exactly why

28:31.876 --> 28:34.963
I feel you should pull your
catalog from their platform.

28:35.004 --> 28:36.673
Are you gonna lock me
in here if I say no?

28:36.715 --> 28:38.299
My company, Fallon Unlimited--

28:38.341 --> 28:40.343
we're starting our own
streaming music service,

28:40.385 --> 28:42.345
and we would be happy
to pay you

28:42.387 --> 28:45.098
a very big bonus if you would be
our first artist.

28:45.140 --> 28:47.016
So, what do you think?

28:47.058 --> 28:48.977
Do you need to check
with those guys outside?

28:49.018 --> 28:51.229
Look, as much
I appreciate the offer,

28:51.271 --> 28:53.231
I'm not interested
in switching things up.

28:53.273 --> 28:55.900
My fans know where
to find me and my music, and

28:55.942 --> 28:58.069
if it ain't broke,
don't fix it, right?

28:58.111 --> 29:00.113
Mm. Wrong.

29:00.155 --> 29:02.657
Because what if
it's making you broke?

29:02.699 --> 29:04.659
Or at least less rich?

29:04.701 --> 29:07.245
I mean, you said it yourself.
You like making money.

29:07.287 --> 29:09.456
Right? So, what if you got

29:09.497 --> 29:12.000
to keep your music
on Tempo Universal

29:12.041 --> 29:14.586
but also make
lots more money?

29:16.671 --> 29:18.757
So, you knew what was
going on with us?

29:18.798 --> 29:20.550
Well, I knew
Amanda had feelings for you.

29:20.592 --> 29:22.761
Well, she may have
feelings for me,

29:22.802 --> 29:25.305
but she may also still
have feelings for her ex.

29:25.346 --> 29:26.723
The judge that lives
in England?

29:26.765 --> 29:28.391
That's the one.

29:28.433 --> 29:30.268
She booked a romantic
hotel room for her trip

29:30.310 --> 29:32.395
and lied to me about
where she was staying.

29:32.437 --> 29:34.773
And then flowers showed up
at the manor with this card.

29:37.150 --> 29:40.111
Okay, so you know
someone has feelings for Amanda.

29:40.153 --> 29:41.821
But you don't know
that it's her ex.

29:41.863 --> 29:43.823
It could be anyone
from her past life in London.

29:43.865 --> 29:45.950
So we've now established that
she's planning on hooking up

29:45.992 --> 29:47.452
with someone in London. Oh.

29:47.494 --> 29:49.037
And if that wasn't bad enough,

29:49.078 --> 29:51.498
the flowers were Juliet roses,
my favorite.

29:51.539 --> 29:53.249
You have a favorite flower?

29:53.291 --> 29:55.001
Seriously?
I was literally your girlfriend.

29:55.043 --> 29:56.920
How could you not know that?
Yeah.

29:56.961 --> 29:59.464
We're gonna add that to the list
of reasons that we broke up.

29:59.506 --> 30:01.090
Boyfriends never listen,
do they?

30:01.132 --> 30:03.009
(laughs)

30:03.051 --> 30:05.011
Wait. Can I see that again?

30:06.179 --> 30:08.556
I have to go.

30:09.057 --> 30:11.392
FALLON:
Oh, I'll buy the company.

30:11.434 --> 30:14.646
But for $25 million less
than I originally offered.

30:14.687 --> 30:16.397
And that's me being generous.

30:16.439 --> 30:18.358
You can think about it,
and we'll talk tomorrow.

30:18.399 --> 30:20.944
I need
to enjoy my mother's wedding.

30:20.985 --> 30:24.113
Cousin, why do I feel like
you were just playing someone?

30:24.155 --> 30:26.658
I just bought
Tempo Universal Streaming

30:26.699 --> 30:29.869
for $25 million less
than I initially offered, mainly

30:29.911 --> 30:32.163
because pop superstar Frankie
just left the platform.

30:32.205 --> 30:34.290
That doesn't exactly sound
like a win.

30:34.332 --> 30:35.750
Oh, but it will be once

30:35.792 --> 30:37.293
that extra $25 million
goes right back

30:37.335 --> 30:39.796
to Frankie and convinces her
to return to the fold.

30:39.838 --> 30:41.798
Only Fallon Carrington could
turn her mother's wedding

30:41.840 --> 30:44.384
into an episode of Succession.
Oh, please.

30:44.425 --> 30:46.970
This is real life.
That show's like a comic book.

30:47.011 --> 30:48.346
So that explains
the good mood.

30:48.388 --> 30:50.598
Well, that,
and Liam and I are meeting

30:50.640 --> 30:53.476
with the best surrogate
in the state later tonight.

30:53.518 --> 30:56.646
Not sure how they judge that,
but, uh,

30:56.688 --> 30:58.773
congratulations, I guess?

30:58.815 --> 31:00.191
Yeah.

31:00.233 --> 31:02.277
(whoops)

31:02.318 --> 31:04.696
Mr. Dexter? My name is

31:04.737 --> 31:06.239
Dominique Deveraux.
You may have heard

31:06.281 --> 31:08.992
of my clothing company
Dom-Mystique?

31:09.033 --> 31:11.619
I actually haven't, so...

31:11.661 --> 31:13.371
Well, you will soon.

31:13.413 --> 31:15.748
I understand you're on the board
at NordicStar,

31:15.790 --> 31:17.292
and I'm part
of the competition

31:17.333 --> 31:19.752
to redesign
the company's uniforms.

31:19.794 --> 31:22.088
I'd love for you to take a look
at what I've got.

31:22.130 --> 31:24.757
Listen, dear,
I appreciate your passion,

31:24.799 --> 31:28.177
but I have nothing to do
with uniform decisions.

31:28.219 --> 31:30.013
I'm more of a financial adviser.

31:30.054 --> 31:32.724
I understand,
but if you like what you see,

31:32.765 --> 31:34.475
you could pass it on
to Val Gibson,

31:34.517 --> 31:36.436
who heads the search committee.

31:36.477 --> 31:38.104
I don't know Val.

31:38.146 --> 31:39.689
And we live
in a merit-based society.

31:39.731 --> 31:41.816
So if your work can't stand
on its own,

31:41.858 --> 31:44.068
I'm afraid
you don't deserve the job.

31:44.110 --> 31:46.654
But women like me

31:46.696 --> 31:50.658
can always use some help
from men like you,

31:50.700 --> 31:52.076
men with more experience.

31:52.118 --> 31:53.536
That is true.

31:53.578 --> 31:55.830
I do like helping
beautiful women.

31:55.872 --> 31:59.375
And with your guidance and
knowledge, I'm sure you could...

32:00.418 --> 32:01.836
Screw this.

32:01.878 --> 32:03.463
I can't do it.
I'm not

32:03.504 --> 32:06.090
some damsel tied
to the railroad tracks.

32:06.132 --> 32:07.258
You know, men like you

32:07.300 --> 32:09.886
from connected families
always think

32:09.928 --> 32:12.388
that they got where they are
by talent alone.

32:12.430 --> 32:14.682
If it was about talent,

32:14.724 --> 32:16.684
I'd be running
the fashion world,

32:16.726 --> 32:18.811
and you'd be my bookkeeper,

32:18.853 --> 32:21.481
if you were lucky.
Excuse me?!

32:21.522 --> 32:23.024
Samir, I am so sorry. (laughs)

32:23.066 --> 32:24.525
Pay no attention to her.

32:24.567 --> 32:26.319
She wasn't even invited.

32:26.361 --> 32:29.656
She must have snuck in
looking for food.

32:29.697 --> 32:31.699
You need to leave. Now.

32:31.741 --> 32:33.743
Either by the elevator
or over the balcony.

32:33.785 --> 32:36.245
(laughs) Didn't you already get
arrested for that once before?

32:36.287 --> 32:39.540
I know you tried
to sabotage me with Samir.

32:39.582 --> 32:41.542
Yes, on my wedding day,

32:41.584 --> 32:44.754
the only thing I can think about
is your little book of costumes.

32:44.796 --> 32:47.757
Let go! Alexis,
don't touch this! Alexis!

32:47.799 --> 32:49.550
Let go of my... book!

32:49.592 --> 32:51.552
(gasps)

32:51.594 --> 32:53.846
(laughs)

32:53.888 --> 32:55.682
Yeah. Okay, no, no, no.

32:55.723 --> 32:57.684
Uh, I think this
party is over, Mom.

32:57.725 --> 32:59.143
Let's get out of here.
Hmm.

32:59.185 --> 33:01.062
Come on. Come on.

33:01.562 --> 33:05.149
I should have known trash
like you never changes.

33:05.191 --> 33:06.609
(gasps)
And now

33:06.651 --> 33:11.990
my son has just made
the biggest mistake of his life.

33:12.031 --> 33:15.284
Hopefully it won't take him
too long to realize it.

33:16.744 --> 33:18.788
(sighs)

33:24.419 --> 33:27.630
I just talked to Samir
on his way out.

33:27.672 --> 33:30.842
(sighs)
If you're here to gloat,
I am not in the mood.

33:30.883 --> 33:33.678
Hmm. For some reason,
neither am I.

33:33.720 --> 33:35.096
I guess sometimes

33:35.138 --> 33:36.806
I remember we're more similar

33:36.848 --> 33:38.766
than I like to admit.
Hmm.

33:38.808 --> 33:40.768
Escaping the past
isn't always easy,

33:40.810 --> 33:45.064
but people do move on.

33:45.106 --> 33:47.108
I would love to believe that,
but it seems

33:47.150 --> 33:49.110
Samir is stuck in cement.

33:49.152 --> 33:52.447
He is not moving on
from this ever.

33:52.488 --> 33:54.115
I know Samir.
He'll come around.

33:54.157 --> 33:55.950
Especially if he wants his son
in his life.

33:55.992 --> 33:58.286
Thank you for being
so supportive.

33:58.327 --> 34:00.538
It's a new look on you.

34:00.580 --> 34:03.458
Consider it a wedding gift
since we didn't get you one.

34:03.499 --> 34:06.669
(laughs)
But, hey, maybe next time
I ask for help,

34:06.711 --> 34:10.006
don't tell people that I am
an alcoholic with rage issues.

34:10.048 --> 34:12.050
Now-now you said,
do whatever it takes.

34:12.091 --> 34:14.052
True.

34:14.093 --> 34:16.637
Okay, send me
the PPA proposal tomorrow,

34:16.679 --> 34:18.306
and I will take a look.

34:19.307 --> 34:22.143
Oh, uh, Alexis.

34:23.186 --> 34:25.021
Congratulations.

34:26.022 --> 34:27.982
(car engine revving)

34:28.024 --> 34:29.776
Where have you been?

34:29.817 --> 34:31.527
I've been calling you all day.
Why didn't you answer?

34:31.569 --> 34:33.905
Well, maybe...
(car door closes)

34:33.946 --> 34:37.867
you called while I was trapped
in a panic room for hours.

34:37.909 --> 34:40.328
Or maybe it was when
I was picking up

34:40.369 --> 34:44.874
the scraps of both my portfolio
and my dignity

34:44.916 --> 34:47.752
on the street in front
of Alexis's penthouse.

34:47.794 --> 34:49.796
Should I be following this?
Because I-I don't...

34:49.837 --> 34:53.174
I have worked my ass off
for months

34:53.216 --> 34:55.468
to land this NordicStar gig.

34:55.510 --> 34:57.929
And just because
I could not bring myself

34:57.970 --> 35:00.139
to be the helpless woman,

35:00.181 --> 35:02.725
my portfolio will probably
never get seen.

35:02.767 --> 35:04.769
That is where you're wrong.

35:04.811 --> 35:08.481
I figured out a way to get you
a boost: Janelle Crowley.

35:08.523 --> 35:09.482
And hear me out.

35:09.524 --> 35:10.942
I follow her on social media.

35:10.983 --> 35:12.652
These celebs post
stuff nonstop.

35:12.693 --> 35:14.445
It's actually kind of annoying,
because the...

35:14.487 --> 35:15.947
The point, Michael?
(mutters)

35:15.988 --> 35:16.614
Yes, the point. Okay.

35:16.614 --> 35:19.408
So, Janelle's always getting
tons of free swag

35:19.450 --> 35:22.495
in the hopes that she'll post it
to her 18 million followers.

35:22.537 --> 35:26.332
So I called her, and she said
she would be more than happy

35:26.374 --> 35:28.501
to post photos of herself

35:28.543 --> 35:31.838
in your wardrobe design
from the movie.

35:31.879 --> 35:32.922
You're kidding.

35:32.964 --> 35:34.340
That's amazing.

35:34.382 --> 35:37.176
Plus, she tagged you
and NordicStar.

35:37.218 --> 35:39.512
So there's no way
you won't get noticed now.

35:39.554 --> 35:42.640
That's one of the nicest things
anyone has ever done for me.

35:42.682 --> 35:44.392
Yeah, you know,
Janelle's not so bad,

35:44.433 --> 35:45.810
especially for an actress,
'cause they're really...

35:45.852 --> 35:47.728
I mean you.

35:47.770 --> 35:49.438
Thank you, Michael.

35:49.480 --> 35:51.190
(laughing):
Okay.
(chuckles)

35:51.232 --> 35:54.193
You know, this is not what
I pictured when you told me

35:54.235 --> 35:56.320
you were trapped
in a panic room for 24 hours.

35:56.362 --> 35:58.072
Well, I just wanted to talk
in private for a moment.

35:58.114 --> 36:00.366
Not everybody out there
needs to know our business.

36:00.408 --> 36:03.244
Well, which business
are we talking?

36:03.286 --> 36:05.746
Streaming or surrogacy?

36:05.788 --> 36:09.167
Streaming is taken care of,
so it's time to talk Tiffany.

36:09.208 --> 36:12.837
Okay, great. I confirmed
we're meeting with her tonight.

36:12.879 --> 36:14.589
Now, did you read her bio?

36:14.630 --> 36:17.425
No, but I heard from a source
that she loves diamonds,

36:17.466 --> 36:19.677
so I'm thinking we could slip
a little tennis bracelet

36:19.719 --> 36:21.012
on her wrist
to seal the deal.

36:21.053 --> 36:24.140
Okay, that's one way to go.

36:24.182 --> 36:26.058
But is there anything
that we would like to know

36:26.100 --> 36:29.353
about her as, like, a...
like, an actual person?

36:29.395 --> 36:30.646
Is that a tanning bed?

36:30.688 --> 36:31.856
Don't worry about it.

36:31.898 --> 36:33.524
What is there to know?

36:33.566 --> 36:36.319
I mean, she's the best there is,
and by the end of the night,

36:36.360 --> 36:38.237
I will have the best
streaming service

36:38.279 --> 36:40.948
and the best surrogate, and
Blake can choke on his sexism.

36:40.990 --> 36:43.409
Is that what this has all
been about?

36:43.451 --> 36:45.620
What, so you can prove to Blake
that you can do it all?

36:45.661 --> 36:47.121
Fallon, you don't need

36:47.163 --> 36:49.081
to prove anything to anybody.

36:49.123 --> 36:52.001
Everyone knows that you kick ass
when it comes to business.

36:52.043 --> 36:54.212
Well, why can't I kick ass at
finding the best surrogate, too?

36:54.253 --> 36:55.755
You will.

36:55.796 --> 36:57.298
Okay, we will.

36:57.340 --> 37:00.718
But, honey,
this isn't business.

37:00.760 --> 37:03.262
Okay, the-the agency
isn't out to get you.

37:03.304 --> 37:04.847
Is it possible
they sent Stacey

37:04.889 --> 37:06.390
because they thought
that she was

37:06.432 --> 37:07.642
the best fit for us?

37:07.683 --> 37:09.936
I guess it's possible.

37:09.977 --> 37:11.812
Hey.

37:11.854 --> 37:14.815
Look, we can say no to Stacey
if you think she's wrong,

37:14.857 --> 37:17.902
but I'm-I'm pretty sure
that we both liked her.

37:17.944 --> 37:20.947
And I trust our instincts, okay?

37:20.988 --> 37:22.698
Not some Buckhead Barbie

37:22.740 --> 37:24.283
who probably
can't even spell "surrogate."

37:24.325 --> 37:26.244
(laughs)
But we need to decide

37:26.285 --> 37:27.703
on this together.

37:27.745 --> 37:31.457
Not as CEOs but as parents.

37:32.458 --> 37:34.043
Okay.

37:36.462 --> 37:38.839
(lively jazz playing)

37:38.881 --> 37:41.592
Hi.
What are you doing here?

37:41.634 --> 37:43.678
I just needed to apologize
as soon as I could.

37:43.719 --> 37:44.845
I should have believed you.

37:44.887 --> 37:46.055
And Adam's the one

37:46.097 --> 37:47.139
that was behind
all of this insanity.

37:47.181 --> 37:47.807
Adam? Why?

37:47.807 --> 37:50.768
He's trying to break us up,
just for payback.

37:50.810 --> 37:53.104
But he messed up
by sending those flowers.

37:53.145 --> 37:54.522
He knew
they were my favorite roses.

37:54.563 --> 37:56.232
Okay, well, as a lawyer,

37:56.274 --> 37:58.693
I can honestly say that
none of this is proof of guilt.

37:58.734 --> 38:01.696
True. Which is why
I went to the florist

38:01.737 --> 38:03.531
and bribed her to tell me
who sent the flowers.

38:03.572 --> 38:06.325
The money came from the
Carrington account. It was Adam.

38:07.576 --> 38:10.037
I never should have doubted you.

38:10.079 --> 38:12.415
Yeah, I-I didn't love that,
to be honest.

38:12.456 --> 38:15.209
I was so insecure because
you want to keep us a secret.

38:15.251 --> 38:18.838
But now I get it, and I agree.

38:18.879 --> 38:22.258
And I also need to get out
of here before anyone sees me,

38:22.300 --> 38:23.676
especially Alexis. Okay.

38:23.718 --> 38:25.803
Wait. Um...

38:28.806 --> 38:30.474
Hello, everyone.

38:30.516 --> 38:34.645
For those that don't know me,
my name's Amanda Carrington, and

38:34.687 --> 38:36.355
on this happy day,

38:36.397 --> 38:37.982
I would like everyone to know

38:38.024 --> 38:42.403
that I am in a wonderful,
committed relationship

38:42.445 --> 38:44.530
with Kirby Anders.

38:44.572 --> 38:45.573
What?!

38:45.614 --> 38:47.074
(applause and cheering)

38:48.409 --> 38:49.910
Nice try.

38:51.245 --> 38:52.788
(glass clinking)
ADAM:
And, um, while we're, uh,

38:52.830 --> 38:54.874
sharing great news, um,

38:54.915 --> 38:56.042
I would like to announce that

38:56.083 --> 38:57.918
I've developed a groundbreaking

38:57.960 --> 38:59.712
anti-aging serum

38:59.754 --> 39:02.590
that's basically
the fountain of youth.

39:02.631 --> 39:03.632
Cool.

39:03.674 --> 39:06.510
FALLON:
And Liam and I have found

39:06.552 --> 39:09.347
our surrogate.
Yes! Her name is Stacey,

39:09.388 --> 39:11.474
and she is going
to help us usher in

39:11.515 --> 39:14.352
the next generation
of Carrington greatness.

39:14.393 --> 39:15.728
(whooping, applause)

39:15.770 --> 39:17.938
I thought this was private.
Oh, I'm sorry.

39:17.980 --> 39:21.067
It just felt like the right time
to jump in. (sighs)

39:27.531 --> 39:28.908
(jazz piano playing)

39:28.949 --> 39:30.493
(sighs)

39:30.534 --> 39:32.286
Big day for the whole family,
it seems.

39:32.328 --> 39:35.373
Mm. I am so sorry.

39:35.414 --> 39:38.376
And to top it off, your father
is back to not liking me.

39:38.417 --> 39:39.877
Yeah, I saw him leave.

39:39.919 --> 39:41.837
But I don't care.

39:41.879 --> 39:44.173
(sighs)

39:44.215 --> 39:46.300
What if he's right?

39:46.342 --> 39:48.052
We've only been married
for three hours,

39:48.094 --> 39:50.262
and already I got in
a fight with Dominique,

39:50.304 --> 39:52.264
my ex-husband told
my father-in-law

39:52.306 --> 39:53.766
that I am an alcoholic,

39:53.808 --> 39:56.102
and all of my children
are narcissists.

39:56.143 --> 39:57.978
You probably want
an annulment.

39:58.020 --> 40:02.525
Do you have any idea how boring
my family was growing up?

40:02.566 --> 40:06.070
Oh. Yours is a breath
of fresh air.

40:06.112 --> 40:08.114
Always has been.

40:08.155 --> 40:10.366
Do you remember those Carrington
Atlantic holiday parties

40:10.408 --> 40:11.951
Blake threw every year?

40:11.992 --> 40:13.994
Oh, my God,
talk about boring.

40:14.036 --> 40:15.663
True.

40:15.704 --> 40:17.873
Except for one year,

40:17.915 --> 40:20.793
when a certain someone showed up
in a sexy Santa outfit

40:20.835 --> 40:24.755
and led a conga line
throughout the entire office.

40:24.797 --> 40:26.465
Me?

40:26.507 --> 40:29.093
You.

40:29.135 --> 40:33.013
I fell in love with you
that day, Alexis.

40:33.055 --> 40:37.435
And I knew you were exactly
the woman I wanted to be with.

40:37.476 --> 40:41.439
And now here we are.

40:41.480 --> 40:44.942
So, as far as I'm concerned,

40:44.984 --> 40:47.611
the more chaos, the better.

40:47.653 --> 40:51.615
Bring it on.

40:51.657 --> 40:53.784
BLAKE:
I cannot wait

40:53.826 --> 40:55.244
to get home.
Yeah. I know.

40:55.286 --> 40:56.704
My feet are killing me.
(elevator bell dings)

40:56.745 --> 40:59.290
Six hours at my ex-wife's
wedding is killing me.

40:59.331 --> 41:01.500
Hello, Blake.

41:01.542 --> 41:02.793
What the hell are
you doing here?

41:02.835 --> 41:05.129
Blake, who is this?

41:06.505 --> 41:08.466
I should've known.

41:08.507 --> 41:10.801
You destroyed the family crest
and sent it to me, didn't you?

41:11.969 --> 41:13.637
Bastard.
(groans)

41:13.679 --> 41:15.222
CRISTAL:
Wait.

41:15.264 --> 41:17.475
I don't understand.
What is going on?

41:18.559 --> 41:19.768
Who are you?

41:19.810 --> 41:21.353
Not bad.

41:21.395 --> 41:23.814
You must be Cristal.
Where are my manners?

41:23.856 --> 41:25.816
I'm Ben Carrington,

41:25.858 --> 41:29.028
Blake's brother.
