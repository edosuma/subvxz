03:07.270 --> 03:09.352
Well, it's not bad. Not bad.

03:09.481 --> 03:12.439
Um... Less vibrato in the strings.

03:12.567 --> 03:14.057
Tubal.

03:14.194 --> 03:17.357
Well, it's really not your afternoon,
is it, Michael?

03:18.740 --> 03:20.947
OK. Let's pick it up tomorrow.

03:21.076 --> 03:23.158
Thank you for a good day's work,
everyone.

03:31.128 --> 03:33.165
Sofia.

03:33.296 --> 03:35.412
- Good work today.
- Oh, thank you.

03:35.549 --> 03:38.462
- Um, cues 17 and 28.
- Hm-hm.

03:38.593 --> 03:40.584
Perhaps you could go over them for me?

03:41.471 --> 03:44.509
You might hear something
I can't quite find.

03:44.641 --> 03:46.097
Of course.

03:46.226 --> 03:48.217
I haven't had time to get the copyist

03:48.353 --> 03:50.435
to have them transcribed
into Braille for you.

03:50.564 --> 03:53.522
Oh, it's OK. I still have
your demo tracks on my phone.

03:53.650 --> 03:55.857
It will be my pleasure.

03:55.986 --> 03:57.727
See you tomorrow morning.

04:35.817 --> 04:37.558
<i>All change, please. All change.</i>

04:37.694 --> 04:38.729
Excuse me.

04:39.696 --> 04:41.027
- Excuse me!
- Yeah?

04:42.991 --> 04:44.072
What did he just say?

04:44.201 --> 04:48.786
Someone's gone under a train at Oxford
Circus. It's the third one this month.

04:48.914 --> 04:50.575
All off at the next stop.

04:51.500 --> 04:52.581
Can I give you a hand?

04:52.709 --> 04:55.076
No. I'm fine, thank you.

06:04.739 --> 06:07.447
<i>(U' THEME FROM TANNHAUSER BY WAGNER)</i>

06:14.958 --> 06:17.871
- Between <i>1992</i> and 1995...
- Two coffees, please.

06:18.003 --> 06:22.793
<i>Over 10,000 people were killed
and 1.8 million people displaced,</i>

06:22.924 --> 06:25.040
<i>with reports of genocide, rape...</i>

06:25.969 --> 06:28.131
<i>widespread in the region.</i>

06:28.263 --> 06:31.597
<i>Tribunal hearings continue
on whether to revoke political asylum</i>

06:31.725 --> 06:34.638
<i>for alleged Serbian war criminal
Zoran Radic.</i>

06:34.769 --> 06:37.227
<i>Radic was accused earlier this year</i>

06:37.355 --> 06:41.189
<i>of using his charitable organisation
to shield arms dealing</i>

06:41.318 --> 06:43.605
- <i>and human trafficking.
- Take away, right?</i>

06:43.737 --> 06:45.398
- To take away, right?
- Yes.

06:45.530 --> 06:50.400
<i>Have been calling for investigation
over allegations of human rights abuses.</i>

06:54.873 --> 06:58.286
Wagner. Overture to Tannhäuser.

06:59.419 --> 07:02.036
I'll get you the next time.

07:02.172 --> 07:03.879
Thanks for the coffee.

07:41.211 --> 07:44.044
You're a hard one to find.

07:44.172 --> 07:46.664
Has my new favourite neighbour
been avoiding me?

07:48.259 --> 07:51.797
I can smell you before I hear you.
It's such a beautiful scent.

07:52.389 --> 07:56.758
I think I put too much on.
I can't smell anything at the moment.

07:57.435 --> 07:59.642
Oh, are you alright?
You do sound a bit bunged up.

07:59.771 --> 08:02.354
A few days in bed sorted me out.

08:02.482 --> 08:04.849
I didn't hear you
in the apartment as usual.

08:04.985 --> 08:09.229
I wanted to thank you for agreeing
to play my father's benefit.

08:11.157 --> 08:12.989
You're not nervous, are you?

08:13.118 --> 08:15.906
Oh, I'm used to playing
in front of people.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.707
That's not what I meant.

08:23.878 --> 08:26.461
I need the money. My father's sick.

08:26.589 --> 08:28.171
So is mine.

08:34.764 --> 08:38.256
You never asked me
if he did those things people say.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.058
Most people ask.

08:42.772 --> 08:45.480
He's your father.
That's for you to know.

08:47.777 --> 08:50.018
You're going to make
quite an impression.

08:55.076 --> 08:57.033
What is that scent you're wearing?

08:59.164 --> 09:00.950
That's my little secret.

09:23.521 --> 09:25.888
Play "Temp Thriller Cue 17".

10:56.030 --> 10:59.273
I don't want anything
from you. I just want him to die.

11:00.618 --> 11:02.700
I don't want anything to do
with you or him.

11:02.829 --> 11:05.947
Because I said so, Alex!
I changed my mind.

11:06.082 --> 11:08.574
Don't tell me what to do.

11:10.795 --> 11:13.583
You want me to tell my father
that you said that?

11:15.216 --> 11:17.924
You don't like
not being in control, Alex.

11:52.462 --> 11:53.623
I don't care.

11:53.755 --> 11:57.544
We have talked about it and then
you don't have to deal with that.

14:08.389 --> 14:09.424
Hello?

14:41.881 --> 14:43.792
Are you OK?

14:45.134 --> 14:46.340
Fine.

14:49.806 --> 14:53.299
I found your scarf earlier downstairs.
Do you want me to bring it up?

14:53.434 --> 14:56.301
Uh, no. No, not now.

15:02.110 --> 15:03.726
Please look after it for me.

15:13.871 --> 15:15.327
Sofia.

15:16.332 --> 15:20.200
My secret scent. It's Liquid Gold.

16:03.212 --> 16:05.249
Stay calm and be sensible
about this.

16:05.381 --> 16:08.169
She sent you here.
Why? Why you, huh?

16:08.301 --> 16:09.666
Veronique, listen to me.

16:09.802 --> 16:12.840
- Why does it have to be you?
- Anything could happen to you.

16:18.436 --> 16:20.848
It's not going to happen.

16:20.980 --> 16:24.143
Not the way he wants.
Not the way your sister wants.

16:52.053 --> 16:54.841
If you could not touch anything, please.

16:54.972 --> 16:56.838
Thank you, Liberace.

16:58.351 --> 17:01.013
What's this? An AA meeting?
Get out, all of you!

17:01.896 --> 17:03.512
You too, Nancy Drew!

17:06.150 --> 17:08.517
Detective Inspector Oscar Mills.

17:08.653 --> 17:11.065
Sorry, that's, <i>uh...</i> habit. My ID.

17:11.196 --> 17:13.154
I believe you.

17:13.281 --> 17:16.319
Listen, I know it's late but if I could
just ask you a few questions.

17:16.452 --> 17:18.284
Did you know Miss Caval?

17:21.540 --> 17:24.407
- No.
- You weren't friends?

17:24.544 --> 17:27.377
I didn't even know that was her surname.

17:27.505 --> 17:29.121
How long did she live above you?

17:29.257 --> 17:32.625
Well, she was here when I moved in.
I've been here nearly six months.

17:34.053 --> 17:36.590
But... you didn't really talk?

17:36.722 --> 17:41.933
You never borrowed a cup of sugar or had
a girlie night in with a bottle of wine?

17:42.061 --> 17:45.144
No, I knew her to say hello to
in the lobby, in the lift, but...

17:45.273 --> 17:47.640
Do you mind me asking,
were you born blind?

17:48.943 --> 17:52.937
It happened when I was five.
It's in my family. My mum was blind.

17:55.157 --> 17:57.444
So you can't see anything at all?

17:58.828 --> 18:03.072
I'm light sensitive,
like most blind people, but no.

18:04.584 --> 18:08.873
Is it true that the loss
of one sense sharpens the others?

18:10.756 --> 18:13.965
That's what they say,
but what have I got to compare it to?

18:14.093 --> 18:16.084
Of course.

18:16.220 --> 18:19.884
But you'd be pretty sure
about anything you hear, right?

18:20.016 --> 18:21.472
Hm-hm.

18:21.601 --> 18:24.684
You told the PC
that you were in the apartment.

18:25.730 --> 18:27.562
With my headphones in.

18:27.690 --> 18:30.728
With your headphones in?
So you didn't hear anything?

18:30.860 --> 18:32.771
No.

18:38.701 --> 18:40.612
You're a pianist. Is that correct?

18:40.745 --> 18:42.235
Hm-hm.

18:42.371 --> 18:45.864
My daughter Lily plays.
She's seven. Asthmatic.

18:46.000 --> 18:51.245
I think the playing calms her.
In the breathing, you know.

19:05.770 --> 19:07.636
Sorry, guv.
Forensics are asking for you.

19:07.772 --> 19:10.309
I'd better get back up there
before they move everything.

19:10.608 --> 19:12.315
Sharon here will take your statement.

19:12.443 --> 19:15.026
Um... I would leave you my card, but...

19:15.154 --> 19:17.270
It's alright,
I've got friends with eyes.

19:17.406 --> 19:18.441
Yes.

19:19.116 --> 19:23.075
If you can think of anything at all...

19:25.414 --> 19:27.075
please do call me.

19:28.250 --> 19:29.866
Thank you.

19:30.002 --> 19:31.663
Thanks.

19:32.797 --> 19:34.754
Right. Let's make this quick, shall we?

19:37.843 --> 19:38.878
Marc...

19:41.013 --> 19:42.253
<i>Marc.</i>

19:45.267 --> 19:47.383
I need you on this.

19:48.771 --> 19:50.057
Can I have it, please?

19:50.189 --> 19:52.100
She didn't have it.

19:52.233 --> 19:55.351
It's on her person
or in her apartment. Go back.

19:57.571 --> 20:00.029
Radic is a very important person to us.

20:00.741 --> 20:05.781
He needs that USB back
before the Russians get hold of it.

20:10.751 --> 20:12.037
What?

20:15.715 --> 20:18.002
There was a woman in the elevator.

20:18.342 --> 20:20.549
She saw me.

20:25.641 --> 20:27.257
Take care of it.

20:37.987 --> 20:39.523
Shh!

21:55.606 --> 21:58.143
Morning!

22:00.402 --> 22:02.234
Morning, Tanya!

22:03.697 --> 22:05.187
Do you want half of this sandwich?

22:05.324 --> 22:07.986
I'm not really supposed
to be eating it...

22:10.079 --> 22:11.661
- He's chatty.
- Who?

22:11.789 --> 22:14.156
I thought you were on a diet.

22:14.291 --> 22:16.077
Well, it's half-fat mayonnaise.

22:17.545 --> 22:19.127
Let's get started.

22:20.631 --> 22:22.668
- What are these?
- Lithium pills.

22:22.800 --> 22:27.465
They were in her personal effects.
For the treatment of bipolar disorder.

22:28.472 --> 22:30.213
Her external examination suggests

22:30.349 --> 22:33.808
that all injuries are consistent
with a fall from the second floor.

22:33.936 --> 22:39.807
Multiple broken bones, back, neck,
fractured skull, extensive bruising.

22:40.609 --> 22:43.692
- Suicide.
- No signs of a struggle.

22:46.740 --> 22:49.858
- Tell me about the nose.
- Oh, rhinoplasty.

22:50.703 --> 22:54.037
Nose job. About a week, five days ago.

22:55.916 --> 22:59.500
Why would I go to the trouble of
dyeing my hair and getting a nose job

22:59.628 --> 23:01.744
to throw myself out of a window?

23:10.681 --> 23:12.388
No! No! No! No!

23:12.516 --> 23:15.634
You're not concentrating, Sofia.
You're behind the beat.

23:15.769 --> 23:17.430
Let's pick it up tomorrow.

23:35.998 --> 23:38.410
Hm-hm. OK, thanks.

23:38.542 --> 23:40.783
Yeah, alright, speak soon. Bye.

23:42.046 --> 23:46.210
- Pretty little thing.
- Important little thing too.

23:46.342 --> 23:48.128
I just found out who Daddy is.

23:49.053 --> 23:52.842
Call me once you've had a good look
around inside. Thanks, Tanya.

23:54.475 --> 23:57.513
<i>Earlier today, Zoran Radic
was seen leaving the morgue</i>

23:57.645 --> 24:00.478
<i>where he officially identified
his daughter's body.</i>

24:00.606 --> 24:02.722
<i>28-year-old Veronique Radic</i>

24:02.858 --> 24:05.566
<i>fell from her apartment building
in central London</i>

24:05.694 --> 24:09.562
<i>in the early hours of the morning
in what appears to be a suicide.</i>

24:09.698 --> 24:12.986
<i>Police are not treating her death
as suspicious.</i>

24:13.118 --> 24:16.406
<i>Protesters took advantage of
this rare public appearance.</i>

24:16.538 --> 24:19.326
<i>Accusations of human rights abuses
during the Bosnian War</i>

24:19.458 --> 24:21.995
<i>continue to be heard against Mr Radic.</i>

24:25.172 --> 24:26.458
<i>Murderer!</i>

24:30.260 --> 24:31.842
Watch out!

27:19.221 --> 27:21.462
- Mills.
<i>- Can you talk?</i>

27:21.598 --> 27:24.386
- <i>Hm. Go</i> for <i>it.</i>
- <i>There were traces of cocaine</i>

27:24.518 --> 27:26.350
and Valium in her system.

27:26.478 --> 27:29.061
- Highly strung.
- And there was something else.

27:29.189 --> 27:31.430
<i>She was pregnant.</i>

27:31.567 --> 27:34.685
- How long?
- <i>About</i> 12 weeks.

27:34.820 --> 27:37.403
- So she would have known.
- No doubt.

27:37.531 --> 27:38.942
<i>Alright, thanks, love.</i>

27:39.074 --> 27:41.031
Wait a second.
Have you told anyone else?

27:41.160 --> 27:43.993
- No, <i>not</i> yet.
- Keep it that way.

28:21.950 --> 28:23.987
The USB.

28:24.119 --> 28:27.862
It wasn't in Veronique's apartment
or her personal effects.

28:28.665 --> 28:30.656
Maybe she'd already given it
to the Russians.

28:30.792 --> 28:33.875
She hadn't. She's hidden it
somewhere in that building.

28:34.004 --> 28:36.120
- It's there.
- It's not.

28:36.256 --> 28:39.339
Alex. I just told you it's not.

28:41.511 --> 28:43.673
I want to show you
something I did find, though.

28:50.896 --> 28:54.855
I want to believe
you didn't know she was pregnant.

28:55.984 --> 28:57.520
I really do.

28:57.653 --> 29:00.486
Then... believe.

29:10.916 --> 29:13.704
Veronique really got to you, didn't she?

29:15.837 --> 29:20.297
Whether that baby is yours or not
is irrelevant.

29:20.425 --> 29:24.043
Radic is a dangerous fucker
who just had his daughter killed.

29:24.179 --> 29:27.137
And you, little brother,
were the hand that pushed.

29:32.854 --> 29:34.720
Good evening.

29:34.856 --> 29:38.440
I wanted to personally thank you all
for being here tonight.

29:40.153 --> 29:47.617
I'm sure most of you have heard that
I lost my beautiful daughter Veronique.

29:48.704 --> 29:51.571
These difficult last months,

29:51.707 --> 29:55.041
the only strength I've been able
to manage came from her.

29:55.919 --> 30:01.540
But also from the work
of this incredible foundation.

30:01.675 --> 30:09.514
Your help with refugees and victims
of global conflicts is truly priceless.

30:10.392 --> 30:12.349
I can tell you
from the bottom of my heart

30:12.477 --> 30:16.471
that Veronique would have wanted us all
to be here tonight

30:16.606 --> 30:20.315
continuing to fight that fight
for that great cause.

30:20.444 --> 30:24.733
So if you will join me
in raising a glass of rakia.

30:28.493 --> 30:30.780
<i>- Ziveli.
- Ziveli.</i>

30:31.872 --> 30:35.240
Yeah, he's good.
Did you write that shit too?

30:43.925 --> 30:46.007
What about that other thing?

30:46.803 --> 30:49.340
- What?
- The woman who saw you.

30:50.057 --> 30:54.221
That's not necessary.
She didn't see anything.

30:56.396 --> 30:58.763
How can you be so sure?

30:58.899 --> 31:00.685
She's blind.

31:02.611 --> 31:03.726
Seriously?

31:06.156 --> 31:07.817
I'll find it, OK?

32:16.852 --> 32:18.889
Beautiful.

32:19.771 --> 32:21.853
I haven't heard it for a long time.

32:22.858 --> 32:24.474
How do you know it?

32:24.985 --> 32:28.979
Veronique. I'm sorry for your loss.

32:30.991 --> 32:33.107
Where did you know her from?

32:33.243 --> 32:35.359
She lived above me at Blackhart Gardens.

32:41.418 --> 32:43.705
Allow me.

33:15.243 --> 33:16.483
Leave us.

33:24.628 --> 33:26.289
Did you know Veronique well?

33:27.714 --> 33:29.455
No, we were just neighbours.

33:32.469 --> 33:34.335
She was always kind to me.

33:36.806 --> 33:39.173
She was a very troubled young woman.

33:41.436 --> 33:44.929
It's been difficult between us
towards the end of her life.

33:47.526 --> 33:50.689
She asked me to play that piece
for you this evening.

33:53.657 --> 33:56.695
She said you used to hum it to her
when she was a little girl.

34:12.007 --> 34:14.750
Please...
If you would excuse me a moment.

34:22.310 --> 34:24.972
Police are still calling it a suicide.

34:25.105 --> 34:26.971
If anything changes, I'll follow up.

34:36.408 --> 34:38.524
I have a contact at Scotland Yard.

34:39.995 --> 34:42.032
I see you've been making friends.

34:43.123 --> 34:45.114
Where did you find her?

34:52.716 --> 34:56.880
She was a friend of Veronique's.
They lived in the same building.

34:58.096 --> 35:00.554
I didn't know Veronique kept friends.

35:04.269 --> 35:06.055
You played beautifully.

35:07.564 --> 35:09.305
Congratulations.

35:09.941 --> 35:12.023
- Thank you.
- Miss Gordon.

35:12.152 --> 35:13.392
Not now.

35:13.528 --> 35:15.565
And well done to you.

35:15.697 --> 35:18.280
You concentrated on the charity
like I said.

35:18.950 --> 35:23.615
And what with Veronique's death,
it can only be viewed sympathetically.

35:23.747 --> 35:25.909
And the tribunal?

35:26.041 --> 35:27.406
All of this helps.

35:27.792 --> 35:31.501
The war is long forgotten
and I am working hard...

35:35.258 --> 35:38.125
I hate to be a party pooper,

35:38.261 --> 35:43.552
but I think you need to be out there
using this exposure to be seen grieving.

35:48.188 --> 35:50.930
Not seducing the blind piano player.

35:54.361 --> 35:55.396
Grieving?

35:56.988 --> 35:59.355
Lets people see you have feelings.

36:00.283 --> 36:03.401
You're a businessman
and a philanthropist.

36:04.162 --> 36:06.244
Leave the rest to me.

36:27.727 --> 36:28.842
Excuse me.

36:30.188 --> 36:34.352
I'm very sorry, Sofia.
I have to get back to my guests.

36:34.484 --> 36:35.565
I understand.

36:35.694 --> 36:39.187
But I would love to see you again.
Would that be possible?

36:40.532 --> 36:42.648
Well, you know where I live.

36:51.751 --> 36:52.786
Sorry.

36:53.128 --> 36:55.620
Leave it, please. It's only champagne.

36:57.298 --> 37:00.165
Nina will see you out.
It's been a pleasure.

38:29.974 --> 38:31.305
Thank you.

38:50.036 --> 38:51.947
How do I look?

38:52.080 --> 38:53.570
Like a million dollars.

39:00.630 --> 39:04.043
Nice shoes!

39:30.159 --> 39:32.696
I told him last night,
don't come back.

39:32.829 --> 39:35.036
- If he does come back...
- What do you mean?

39:35.164 --> 39:36.450
Don't listen to that.

39:37.834 --> 39:39.495
Come on, shut up, bruv!

39:39.627 --> 39:42.164
You're pissing me off.
Whoa! Look where you're going!

39:42.297 --> 39:44.413
- Sorry.
- You fucking blind or something?

39:44.549 --> 39:47.086
- What's going on?
- Fucking hell! She is blind!

39:47.218 --> 39:49.380
Fucking hell! Go on, girl!

39:49.512 --> 39:52.345
- Please, just leave me alone.
- Just leave me alone!

39:54.350 --> 39:56.591
Please, I have some money.
You can take it.

39:56.728 --> 40:00.392
- We look skint to you?
- Test she can't see you. Idiot!

40:02.233 --> 40:04.474
Hey! When was the last time
you got fucked?

40:04.611 --> 40:06.272
Been a while, yeah? I could show you...

40:06.404 --> 40:07.894
- Easy! Whoa!
- No need for that.

40:08.031 --> 40:10.193
That's a bit mean, girl.
You little sket.

40:11.075 --> 40:12.816
- Whoa! Whoa! Where you going?
- No!

40:14.662 --> 40:16.152
On your knees already, love?

40:32.013 --> 40:34.050
- Don't hurt me!
- I won't.

40:43.191 --> 40:47.230
Do you usually hang around
street comers fighting crime?

40:49.989 --> 40:54.859
I work for my sister.
She runs a security consulting firm.

40:54.994 --> 40:56.780
Does she boss you around?

40:57.664 --> 40:59.280
Yeah.

40:59.958 --> 41:03.997
Yeah, me and my sis,
we came from nothing.

41:04.128 --> 41:07.041
Mum was a druggie. Dad wasn't around.

41:07.173 --> 41:09.585
Sorry to hear that.
How's your mum doing now?

41:09.717 --> 41:10.878
Oh, she's dead.

41:13.888 --> 41:15.128
Mine too.

41:19.894 --> 41:22.135
You sure you don't want
to report this to the police?

41:22.271 --> 41:24.512
Oh, no more police for me this week.

41:24.649 --> 41:26.515
Why, are you a troublemaker?

41:30.905 --> 41:36.526
The woman in the apartment above me,
she... fell from her window last night.

41:38.621 --> 41:41.283
- Detective said it was a suicide.
- Detective?

41:42.333 --> 41:44.449
- So you were questioned?
- Hm-hm.

41:45.211 --> 41:46.417
What did you tell him?

41:47.130 --> 41:49.246
I told him I didn't see anything.

41:54.470 --> 41:55.926
I told him I didn't know her.

41:58.808 --> 42:00.424
But you did.

42:00.560 --> 42:02.767
Not well. We spoke
every once in a while.

42:02.895 --> 42:06.104
She seemed kind of lost.

42:10.111 --> 42:11.693
This is hers.

42:13.990 --> 42:16.027
You can still smell her on it.

42:41.934 --> 42:44.767
- There's blood on this.
- It's mine.

42:44.896 --> 42:48.434
I tripped on it in the lobby
yesterday morning and I cut my finger.

42:49.901 --> 42:53.690
I didn't want the police to think I had
anything to do with it, so I kept it.

42:53.821 --> 42:56.483
It's silly, really.
It's just a little bit of blood.

42:58.785 --> 43:00.867
You don't have to say anything,
you know.

43:01.412 --> 43:05.701
I mean, if the police think
it's a suicide, they're probably right.

43:08.503 --> 43:10.414
What do you think happened?

43:11.798 --> 43:13.038
I don't know.

43:14.717 --> 43:16.628
I had my headphones in.

43:45.581 --> 43:48.699
Thank you... for saving me.

43:57.426 --> 44:00.919
If you ever see that man again,
play something by Satie for me.

44:07.979 --> 44:10.471
I want to take away
everything he's built.

44:12.400 --> 44:13.856
I want to destroy him!

44:13.985 --> 44:16.647
I want to destroy him!
I want to destroy him!

44:16.779 --> 44:19.271
I want to destroy him!

44:20.950 --> 44:23.863
<i>The Russian ambassador

44:23.995 --> 44:26.532
<i>to revoke political asylum

Sofia.

Please look after it for me.

46:36.043 --> 46:38.785
My secret scent. It's Liquid Gold.

47:19.086 --> 47:22.329
Miss McKendrick? It's Detective Mills.

47:23.674 --> 47:24.789
Good morning.

47:28.846 --> 47:31.884
You're an early riser
like myself, are you?

47:32.850 --> 47:34.761
- Morning.
- Yeah, sorry to interrupt.

47:34.894 --> 47:38.728
I thought you'd paused.
I was listening upstairs. Beautiful.

47:38.856 --> 47:40.392
Thank you.

47:40.524 --> 47:42.356
I could hear you surprisingly well...

47:42.485 --> 47:46.069
through the... Yeah.

47:46.197 --> 47:49.781
These old buildings.
The sound really carries.

47:52.161 --> 47:53.743
Yeah.

47:53.871 --> 47:56.989
You haven't had any more thoughts
about the other night?

47:57.124 --> 47:58.706
I'm sorry, Detective Inspector.

47:58.834 --> 48:00.916
Oh, Oscar, please.

48:02.213 --> 48:05.422
Why would a pregnant woman
throw herself out of a window?

48:06.967 --> 48:09.129
You didn't know.

48:09.261 --> 48:13.755
Oh, of course. She is a mystery box.

48:15.393 --> 48:17.259
What do you mean?

48:17.395 --> 48:19.102
Well, she's a suicide,

48:19.230 --> 48:22.439
and then we find out who she really is,
who her father is.

48:22.566 --> 48:24.398
I'm sure you've heard the news.

48:25.569 --> 48:30.188
Yeah. Then I find out she's pregnant.
Another mystery box.

48:33.411 --> 48:36.654
Thanks, Miss McKendrick.
I'm sure we'll speak again.

50:47.753 --> 50:49.619
I got your card.

50:52.716 --> 50:54.423
You need to disappear.

50:56.929 --> 50:58.385
The police questioned you?

51:01.392 --> 51:02.427
Yeah.

51:03.852 --> 51:06.890
Detective Inspector Oscar Mills.

51:08.566 --> 51:11.684
Divorced. One daughter, aged seven.

51:14.905 --> 51:16.270
He's dedicated.

51:16.407 --> 51:18.489
He'll be checking you out.

51:19.785 --> 51:23.653
Your background, your identity.
Everything.

51:23.789 --> 51:26.907
You're not taking your medication.

51:27.626 --> 51:30.789
- You look tired.
- And whisky doesn't count.

51:32.089 --> 51:33.454
Are you sleeping?

51:35.551 --> 51:36.837
Nightmares, huh?

51:39.597 --> 51:42.510
Veronique's death changes everything.

51:42.641 --> 51:44.598
It doesn't change anything.

51:45.561 --> 51:47.177
She was your way in.

51:48.105 --> 51:49.516
She's dead.

51:49.648 --> 51:52.436
Your association with her

51:52.568 --> 51:54.400
<i>draws</i> attention to you.

51:54.528 --> 51:56.439
You are not safe any more.

51:56.572 --> 51:58.028
You had your chance.

51:59.533 --> 52:02.901
You didn't take it.

52:04.288 --> 52:07.497
Radic has tightened his security.

52:07.625 --> 52:09.036
I was interrupted.

52:09.752 --> 52:12.210
Yeah. Well, you didn't take it.

52:12.338 --> 52:14.454
The Kremlin want his head on a stick.

52:14.590 --> 52:17.298
- They can do it, you don't have to.
- I have another way in.

52:18.260 --> 52:19.421
I'm being followed.

52:20.846 --> 52:22.177
For this.

52:22.765 --> 52:24.756
That USB leads
all the way back to Radic.

52:24.892 --> 52:26.883
Whoever wants it
can get me in front of him.

52:27.019 --> 52:29.602
I've waited too many years,
come too far.

52:29.730 --> 52:31.846
That bitch planted it on me.

52:33.901 --> 52:36.689
I don't know what's on it,
but it was worth killing her for.

52:36.820 --> 52:38.652
You don't have to do this.

52:38.781 --> 52:40.363
You're not a killer, Sofia.

52:40.491 --> 52:43.904
Poisoning someone is one thing.
Using your bare hands is another.

52:44.453 --> 52:47.070
Don't you dare change your mind.

52:48.624 --> 52:52.492
I carried you through that mile-long
hellhole under Sarajevo airport,

52:52.628 --> 52:54.118
so you could have a second chance.

52:54.254 --> 52:56.086
That second chance
was so I could do this.

52:56.215 --> 52:59.628
You know what he did
to my family, my sister.

52:59.760 --> 53:03.469
These people kill every day.

53:04.139 --> 53:06.471
- Live your life.
- You never did.

53:07.309 --> 53:11.394
There was war where I found you.
Genocide. This...

53:12.898 --> 53:14.855
- This is more...
- Personal?

53:14.983 --> 53:19.648
You tell me what's more important
than that. I have to finish this.

53:21.490 --> 53:23.777
You, above all people, know that.

53:43.429 --> 53:45.887
Give me a few hours
to look through the USB.

53:47.349 --> 53:49.556
There'll be a password.

53:49.685 --> 53:52.848
Try "liquid gold".
It's Veronique's perfume.

53:55.941 --> 53:58.524
Niall, how's Oliver?

54:00.070 --> 54:04.780
Oh, you know what he's like. Arthritis
in his leg's still giving him gyp.

54:05.784 --> 54:07.695
He's as tough as nails, that old cat.

54:07.828 --> 54:09.865
Yeah, I know someone else like that.

54:19.298 --> 54:20.788
Come on.

54:25.012 --> 54:26.127
Good girl.

54:27.347 --> 54:28.508
Good girl.

54:37.024 --> 54:39.732
<i>(U' THEME FROM TANNHAUSER BY WAGNER)</i>

55:00.756 --> 55:01.996
Where is it?

55:13.352 --> 55:16.470
USB. She gave it to you.
Where is it?

55:56.436 --> 55:57.767
Come on, step here.

55:57.896 --> 56:00.103
- I can't hear.
- It's OK.

56:00.232 --> 56:03.520
- I can't hear!
- Shh!

56:04.820 --> 56:07.152
- Hold on to me.
- I can't hear.

56:09.241 --> 56:11.323
If you don't tell me what's going on,
I can't help.

56:11.451 --> 56:14.239
- I know Veronique gave you something.
- I don't have anything.

56:16.456 --> 56:19.164
A USB. You need to stop lying to me.

56:19.293 --> 56:22.001
Who's lying to who?
How long have you been following me?

56:22.129 --> 56:24.291
Look, this won't stop
until they get it back.

56:24.423 --> 56:25.458
You need to move or...

56:25.591 --> 56:28.424
Or what? You're going to kill me
like you killed Veronique?

56:29.303 --> 56:32.716
I heard you with that old man
by the river speaking Serbo-Croat.

56:32.848 --> 56:35.590
Is that what this is about?
Revenge against Radic for the war?

56:37.102 --> 56:38.718
You don't know anything about me.

56:38.854 --> 56:42.597
I know whatever game you're playing,
you just stumbled into someone else's.

56:42.733 --> 56:45.373
Your only option is to let me help.
Did you give it to the old man?

56:45.485 --> 56:46.600
I don't need your help.

56:46.737 --> 56:50.731
Did you give it to the old man?
I'm trying to help you.

56:50.866 --> 56:54.154
Why? Who are you?
Why are you always saving me?

56:54.286 --> 56:55.776
Hm?

56:57.539 --> 57:00.622
You're the one in trouble
if you don't know why you're helping me.

57:07.049 --> 57:08.084
Help!

57:10.093 --> 57:11.128
Help!

57:50.550 --> 57:54.760
You know, the first time
I hummed that to you...

57:56.348 --> 57:57.964
I could lift you with one arm.

58:16.785 --> 58:18.571
I don't have much time.

58:20.247 --> 58:21.863
You were right about the password.

58:26.503 --> 58:30.542
This USB is everything
someone would need to know

58:30.674 --> 58:32.005
to take over his operations.

58:32.134 --> 58:36.378
All his business interests,
his commercial assets

58:36.513 --> 58:40.632
that he got on the cheap
after NATO bombed the shite out of them.

58:41.560 --> 58:44.643
Veronique wasn't betraying her father
on her own.

58:45.981 --> 58:47.767
There's communications.

58:47.899 --> 58:52.484
Two aliases. Serebro and Zoloto.

58:52.612 --> 58:54.353
Silver and Gold.

58:55.991 --> 58:57.481
Veronique was Gold.

58:58.243 --> 59:00.200
They were using this information

59:00.328 --> 59:03.741
to betray Radic to the Russians,
to take him down.

59:03.874 --> 59:07.538
You find Serebro,
you find your way back to Radic.

59:17.679 --> 59:19.386
I've always done my best for you.

59:22.768 --> 59:24.884
You're everything to me.

59:33.278 --> 59:34.643
You can't stay here.

59:37.491 --> 59:38.947
You've got to be strong.

59:40.410 --> 59:41.866
Leave.

59:44.122 --> 59:47.581
Your clothes are in the locker
on the right.

01:00:40.762 --> 01:00:43.675
What kind of mystery box are you, Sofia?

01:01:01.283 --> 01:01:02.739
Sorry.

01:01:05.287 --> 01:01:09.576
Listen, can you call me when she wakes?

01:01:09.708 --> 01:01:11.870
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.

01:01:48.705 --> 01:01:53.040
<i>Floor four. Doors opening.</i>

01:01:54.753 --> 01:01:57.370
<i>Lift going up.</i>

01:03:05.156 --> 01:03:08.114
She, uh... said you'd know
where to find her.

01:03:42.152 --> 01:03:43.608
Was she standing here?

01:03:52.454 --> 01:03:54.161
Tell me what happened.

01:03:56.374 --> 01:03:58.331
I heard a struggle

01:03:58.460 --> 01:04:00.667
and then her heels
ran over to the window.

01:04:01.671 --> 01:04:03.912
I was sent to kill her
but I came to help.

01:04:05.467 --> 01:04:07.083
She wouldn't listen.

01:04:08.011 --> 01:04:11.299
She was scared, making plans to leave.

01:04:11.931 --> 01:04:13.638
Veronique wasn't well.

01:04:15.477 --> 01:04:16.967
And she never really was.

01:04:21.608 --> 01:04:23.519
She was standing where you are now.

01:04:25.111 --> 01:04:26.317
Crying.

01:04:28.156 --> 01:04:30.022
She asked me to go away with her.

01:04:30.158 --> 01:04:31.398
Why didn't you?

01:04:35.747 --> 01:04:40.412
When I was a little girl, my father used
to sit me at the piano with my sister.

01:04:41.378 --> 01:04:45.121
And he'd blindfold her
so she couldn't see, like me.

01:04:47.801 --> 01:04:52.090
And that was how we learnt to play.
Together.

01:04:56.893 --> 01:05:03.606
My father, he went out of his way
to make sure that we were equals.

01:05:07.987 --> 01:05:12.072
To make sure that my sister knew
what it was like to be blind.

01:05:36.558 --> 01:05:38.515
Now you see what I see.

01:06:32.989 --> 01:06:34.900
Shh!

01:06:38.703 --> 01:06:44.164
I'm from a village outside of Bijeljina.
Northeast Bosnia.

01:06:45.376 --> 01:06:48.164
My parents knew Radic.
They were neighbours for years.

01:06:48.963 --> 01:06:53.252
My sister and I used to play
in his garden before the war started.

01:06:54.844 --> 01:07:00.556
One day, Serbian paramilitaries came
to my home and they killed my family.

01:07:03.102 --> 01:07:05.093
Radic was their commander.

01:07:06.189 --> 01:07:08.180
I was the only one that survived.

01:07:14.239 --> 01:07:16.776
Who sent you to kill Veronique?

01:07:18.785 --> 01:07:19.991
My sister.

01:07:21.579 --> 01:07:23.866
Alexandra Gordon.

01:07:26.876 --> 01:07:29.709
She didn't tell you
Veronique was pregnant, did she?

01:07:36.594 --> 01:07:38.050
It was yours, wasn't it?

01:07:45.728 --> 01:07:48.311
Killing Radic won't change
a thing, you know.

01:07:49.399 --> 01:07:51.390
It won't bring your family back.

01:07:52.569 --> 01:07:55.482
You think that darkness inside of you
will heal. It won't.

01:07:57.448 --> 01:08:00.156
Your soul just gets
a little darker until...

01:08:02.745 --> 01:08:04.076
Until there's nothing left.

01:08:08.376 --> 01:08:10.333
I didn't kill Veronique.

01:08:12.547 --> 01:08:13.833
She jumped.

01:08:36.904 --> 01:08:39.236
I want to meet your sister. Alone.

01:08:47.874 --> 01:08:51.582
I was trying to think of
somewhere neutral for us to meet.

01:08:51.711 --> 01:08:56.251
Slightly unfair choice, I admit,
but... I do love this place.

01:08:57.175 --> 01:09:02.841
I love the silence,
but I also love... the smell.

01:09:06.017 --> 01:09:08.600
I thought you'd at least
appreciate that.

01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:13.138
Well done in using my brother
to get to me.

01:09:14.567 --> 01:09:17.854
And it seems we both used Veronique
to get at the same thing,

01:09:17.987 --> 01:09:20.479
albeit for very different reasons.

01:09:20.615 --> 01:09:22.276
Only one of us killed her.

01:09:23.076 --> 01:09:24.783
You have something that belongs to me?

01:09:25.328 --> 01:09:28.866
You came all this way for a photograph
you can't even see?

01:09:35.587 --> 01:09:37.875
- Did you copy it?
- Of course.

01:09:38.508 --> 01:09:40.044
Do you have the USB?

01:09:44.930 --> 01:09:46.421
Why didn't you hand it over

01:09:46.557 --> 01:09:49.720
when you were having your fingers broken
in the back of the van?

01:09:50.435 --> 01:09:53.269
Well, I'd only just realised
what its true value was.

01:09:53.398 --> 01:09:57.141
You've no idea of its true value
without the password.

01:10:01.739 --> 01:10:03.446
I love this painting.

01:10:06.369 --> 01:10:10.738
I used to come here
and sit for hours staring at it.

01:10:10.873 --> 01:10:13.535
What is it?

01:10:13.668 --> 01:10:16.581
The Death <i>of</i> Actaeon by Titian.

01:10:18.131 --> 01:10:23.717
In revenge for surprising Artemis
while she bathed naked in the wood,

01:10:23.845 --> 01:10:27.258
she transformed Actaeon into a stag.

01:10:29.058 --> 01:10:32.141
He galloped off into the forest
seeking refuge

01:10:32.270 --> 01:10:36.889
and he was hunted by his own hounds
who didn't recognise him.

01:10:38.776 --> 01:10:41.689
They attacked and killed him

01:10:41.821 --> 01:10:45.405
as he looked at his own reflection
in a pond

01:10:45.533 --> 01:10:47.274
and saw what he'd become.

01:10:48.619 --> 01:10:50.986
Do you ever stare at your reflection?

01:10:54.751 --> 01:10:56.583
What do you want?

01:10:56.711 --> 01:11:00.045
- Liquid Gold.
- Excuse me?

01:11:00.173 --> 01:11:01.288
The password.

01:11:02.633 --> 01:11:06.592
I wasn't much into art when I was
a little girl, as you'd imagine.

01:11:06.721 --> 01:11:09.088
But I loved chemistry

01:11:09.223 --> 01:11:11.840
and I learnt all the elements
off by heart.

01:11:11.976 --> 01:11:16.516
Where I come from, silver is serebro.

01:11:17.690 --> 01:11:21.979
But the element is the same in
the periodic table wherever you're from.

01:11:22.111 --> 01:11:25.570
AG. Alexandra Gordon.

01:11:27.825 --> 01:11:30.408
I want to be alone with him.

01:11:32.246 --> 01:11:34.453
Well, why would I
put you alone with Radic

01:11:34.582 --> 01:11:37.244
when you could just as easily
tell him who I am?

01:11:38.002 --> 01:11:39.959
What other choice do you have?

01:11:40.087 --> 01:11:41.919
And I'd be doing you a favour.

01:11:42.048 --> 01:11:44.665
My enemy's enemy is my friend.

01:11:46.135 --> 01:11:50.720
I can only imagine how awful this must
have been for you all these years.

01:11:51.307 --> 01:11:56.677
Living in the dark, dreaming of the day
you'd be face to face with him again.

01:11:58.189 --> 01:11:59.725
Did he do that to you?

01:12:02.443 --> 01:12:05.526
We both know he has a penchant
for blind girls.

01:12:07.782 --> 01:12:13.869
If he saw this photo of your family,

01:12:13.996 --> 01:12:16.488
he'd know exactly who they are,
wouldn't he?

01:12:20.127 --> 01:12:23.665
- You copied the USB?
- Of course.

01:12:29.971 --> 01:12:32.212
You're going to take me
to Veronique's funeral today

01:12:32.348 --> 01:12:34.760
and you're going to make sure
that I'm left alone with him.

01:12:35.935 --> 01:12:39.348
And if I walk out of here
and end up in the back of another van...

01:12:40.773 --> 01:12:42.355
then rest assured...

01:12:44.986 --> 01:12:48.399
that USB will find its way to him
before you do.

01:12:52.326 --> 01:12:54.863
You are way out of your depth.

01:12:54.996 --> 01:12:57.033
Maybe.

01:12:57.164 --> 01:13:00.282
But I'm not afraid to die doing this.
Are you?

01:13:04.714 --> 01:13:06.000
Marc...

01:13:07.508 --> 01:13:09.499
He's a good fuck, isn't he?

01:13:15.683 --> 01:13:18.425
You're a murderer! Murderer!

01:13:18.561 --> 01:13:20.518
Murderer!

01:14:09.862 --> 01:14:11.193
Good day, Sofia.

01:14:12.406 --> 01:14:14.238
It's Radic.

01:14:21.332 --> 01:14:23.289
- Thank you for coming.
- Pleasure.

01:14:23.417 --> 01:14:26.455
Please. Come with me.

01:14:26.587 --> 01:14:29.045
We're having a little reception
at the house.

01:14:37.431 --> 01:14:38.842
They want me dead.

01:14:40.226 --> 01:14:41.682
All of them.

01:14:43.145 --> 01:14:46.354
If they could open the door,
they would pull me out into the streets

01:14:46.482 --> 01:14:49.019
and do to me all the things
they accuse me of.

01:14:49.777 --> 01:14:51.939
But would it make any difference?

01:14:52.780 --> 01:14:55.647
Would it change the past, Sofia?

01:14:57.326 --> 01:15:01.160
When I was a little boy, I used to play
hide-and-seek with my mother.

01:15:02.665 --> 01:15:06.659
And I'd cover my eyes with my hands
and think that no one could see me.

01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:14.924
Did you ever play hide-and-seek
when you were a little girl?

01:15:15.052 --> 01:15:16.167
Yes.

01:15:17.179 --> 01:15:19.511
Where was your favourite place to hide?

01:15:21.726 --> 01:15:23.842
There was a wardrobe in my bedroom.

01:15:26.897 --> 01:15:27.932
Strange...

01:15:29.650 --> 01:15:32.358
The reassurance that can be found
in dark places.

01:15:35.448 --> 01:15:38.065
You know, I don't believe
anything of you.

01:15:39.285 --> 01:15:40.525
I think you're lying.

01:15:41.287 --> 01:15:43.494
And you are weak.

01:15:43.622 --> 01:15:44.657
Yes, you're weak.

01:15:44.790 --> 01:15:48.328
And it's not your father's
weak Bosnian blood. I can tell you that.

01:15:49.670 --> 01:15:51.081
You know why?

01:15:52.506 --> 01:15:56.716
Sometime before the war,
I lived in a small village.

01:15:57.970 --> 01:16:02.009
And there was a blind woman,
a Catholic woman.

01:16:03.142 --> 01:16:08.262
And she was married to a Muslim man
and they had a daughter.

01:16:09.273 --> 01:16:13.688
And I thought
I was in love with that woman.

01:16:15.404 --> 01:16:19.443
I came across her one day
on the road outside the village

01:16:21.202 --> 01:16:23.614
and we were friends, so she knew me.

01:16:25.748 --> 01:16:28.831
I led her into the forest

01:16:30.878 --> 01:16:32.494
and I raped her.

01:16:35.716 --> 01:16:38.003
And she never said a word.

01:16:38.135 --> 01:16:39.751
She never told anyone.

01:16:41.639 --> 01:16:45.303
And she became pregnant
and she had a little girl.

01:16:46.894 --> 01:16:52.685
And a few years later,
that little girl became blind.

01:16:58.656 --> 01:17:00.567
They never told you, did they?

01:17:01.325 --> 01:17:03.111
Now, I left before the war broke out

01:17:03.244 --> 01:17:08.455
but when it broke out,
I went back to that village.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:11.331
You remember?

01:17:13.379 --> 01:17:17.668
And I went to their house again
with my men...

01:17:20.010 --> 01:17:24.550
and I raped that blind Catholic woman
again.

01:17:25.933 --> 01:17:27.890
Then my men raped her.

01:17:35.067 --> 01:17:37.900
All I remember is
her dead eyes looking at me

01:17:38.028 --> 01:17:42.898
and I knew in that moment
she knew who I was.

01:17:45.494 --> 01:17:47.656
And then...

01:17:47.788 --> 01:17:51.622
Then I killed her dirty Bosniak
and burnt her house to the ground.

01:18:00.551 --> 01:18:02.667
You know, Sofia,

01:18:02.803 --> 01:18:06.216
people have seen me
and the things I've done.

01:18:07.683 --> 01:18:09.515
But they are just copies of me.

01:18:10.686 --> 01:18:13.018
Just shadows.

01:18:13.147 --> 01:18:14.979
But that woman, she saw me.

01:18:15.858 --> 01:18:17.940
She really saw me.

01:18:19.695 --> 01:18:23.438
And you look at me just as she did.

01:18:24.783 --> 01:18:27.741
Seeing without seeing.

01:18:32.708 --> 01:18:34.449
Stop me, Sofia.

01:18:35.753 --> 01:18:37.664
Just stop me.

01:18:39.465 --> 01:18:40.705
Do it.

01:18:42.426 --> 01:18:44.042
Do it!

01:18:44.178 --> 01:18:45.339
Do it now!

01:18:45.471 --> 01:18:47.758
You want me dead more than they do!

01:18:47.890 --> 01:18:51.804
They've already made up their minds
and you can't decide?

01:18:54.230 --> 01:18:57.063
- Serebro!
- What?

01:18:57.191 --> 01:19:01.150
Someone close to you was betraying you
with Veronique. Serebro.

01:19:09.912 --> 01:19:11.027
Drivel.

01:19:28.472 --> 01:19:29.883
Can I help you?

01:19:31.225 --> 01:19:34.889
- I... need to talk to...
- Sorry, love. I can't hear you.

01:19:35.020 --> 01:19:38.183
I need to speak
to Detective Inspector Mills.

01:19:38.315 --> 01:19:41.649
DI Mills isn't around just now.
Is there something I can help you with?

01:19:41.777 --> 01:19:44.940
But... I... Yes, he gave me his card.

01:19:45.072 --> 01:19:47.530
He said if I need to talk to him,
I can talk to him. I...

01:19:47.658 --> 01:19:49.695
Right. Alright.

01:19:49.827 --> 01:19:52.068
Just wait one moment then, please, love.

01:20:14.143 --> 01:20:15.554
Hello?

01:20:15.686 --> 01:20:17.927
Can I speak to Niall? Is he there?

01:20:18.063 --> 01:20:20.555
<i>I'm afraid that's not possible.</i>

01:20:20.691 --> 01:20:22.807
I really need to speak to him.

01:20:22.943 --> 01:20:24.274
<i>Belma?</i>

01:20:25.696 --> 01:20:27.653
<i>- Is that you?
- Yes.</i>

01:20:29.533 --> 01:20:31.615
<i>He passed away last night.</i>

01:20:34.038 --> 01:20:36.746
<i>He arranged a way for you to get out.</i>

01:20:36.874 --> 01:20:41.118
<i>He said he was sorry, but he wasn't
strong enough to carry you any longer.</i>

01:20:45.007 --> 01:20:46.247
Thank you.

01:20:47.593 --> 01:20:50.460
<i>Belma? Belma?</i>

01:21:37.059 --> 01:21:39.391
I heard you were looking for me.

01:21:41.355 --> 01:21:42.561
Sofia.

01:21:43.565 --> 01:21:45.431
You can't help me.

01:21:46.193 --> 01:21:48.150
You came to the police station.

01:21:48.278 --> 01:21:50.064
I haven't committed any crime.

01:21:51.115 --> 01:21:53.447
Not telling you who beat me up
is not against the law

01:21:53.575 --> 01:21:57.113
and Veronique, whether you like it
or not, was a suicide.

01:21:57.246 --> 01:22:00.784
So, as far as I can tell,
we have nothing else to talk about.

01:22:00.916 --> 01:22:05.501
Last time I checked,
identity theft was against the law.

01:22:07.339 --> 01:22:11.879
Sofia McKendrick died
when she was three months old...

01:22:14.888 --> 01:22:21.260
along with her mother in a car crash
just outside Glasgow in 1985.

01:22:22.229 --> 01:22:27.520
Her father, Niall McKendrick,
ex-SAS, was away on tour at the time.

01:22:27.651 --> 01:22:30.359
That's who was with you
in the hospital last night.

01:22:31.655 --> 01:22:34.989
You stole Sofia McKendrick's identity.

01:22:35.117 --> 01:22:37.529
So who are you?

01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:40.202
I don't know any more.

01:22:44.418 --> 01:22:47.160
Daddy, I pressed the wrong button
and my game is gone.

01:22:47.296 --> 01:22:50.414
I thought you were going to wait
in the car like a good girl.

01:22:52.384 --> 01:22:57.379
Here you are. Go and choose a cake
and then sit there where I can see you.

01:22:59.349 --> 01:23:03.843
Sorry. My wife's away on business.
I had to pick her up from school early.

01:23:03.979 --> 01:23:05.595
She has bad asthma.

01:23:05.731 --> 01:23:07.062
Yeah, you said.

01:23:10.694 --> 01:23:12.731
That's Saint Raphael.

01:23:14.072 --> 01:23:17.235
The patron saint of the blind
and travellers.

01:23:17.367 --> 01:23:19.699
It was on your bed in the hospital.

01:23:21.497 --> 01:23:22.783
No more lies.

01:23:27.169 --> 01:23:30.787
I'm an orphan.
Niall McKendrick adopted me.

01:23:30.923 --> 01:23:33.290
Not legally.
He wouldn't have been able to.

01:23:34.468 --> 01:23:36.004
Let me tell you what I think.

01:23:36.803 --> 01:23:40.262
Veronique was using you,
manipulating you.

01:23:40.390 --> 01:23:41.801
I looked into her background.

01:23:41.934 --> 01:23:44.096
Her father, Zoran Radic,

01:23:44.228 --> 01:23:47.641
did a lot of very, very nasty things
during the Bosnian War.

01:23:48.190 --> 01:23:50.773
No doubt that had a marked effect
on Veronique.

01:23:52.194 --> 01:23:57.234
He seems to like women like you.
Blind women.

01:23:57.366 --> 01:24:00.859
Maybe she was happy
to throw you into the pit.

01:24:00.994 --> 01:24:02.951
Maybe she was. What of it?

01:24:03.080 --> 01:24:08.666
Or maybe you were using Veronique
to get closer to her father.

01:24:09.670 --> 01:24:16.508
Maybe he hurt you and your family
during the war

01:24:16.635 --> 01:24:19.002
and now you want to hurt him.

01:24:20.180 --> 01:24:23.138
That's what I think.

01:24:23.892 --> 01:24:26.554
Do I look like someone
who could hurt him?

01:24:35.279 --> 01:24:38.488
I'm tired and these painkillers
are wearing off.

01:24:39.825 --> 01:24:43.159
I am sure you're going to find out
everything you need to know.

01:24:44.788 --> 01:24:49.282
Nothing you do is by chance.
Even when you lie, you tell the truth.

01:25:30.042 --> 01:25:31.624
Domesticated I.

01:25:33.253 --> 01:25:34.618
I had no idea.

01:25:38.467 --> 01:25:40.834
Try my Béarnaise sauce.

01:25:42.387 --> 01:25:44.003
It's the best you've ever tasted.

01:25:44.598 --> 01:25:49.263
I'm 45 years old and a size 10.
Does it look like I eat dairy?

01:25:50.228 --> 01:25:51.593
It's a pity.

01:25:53.315 --> 01:25:56.979
Um... Let's talk about the blind girl.

01:25:57.778 --> 01:25:59.394
Is it finished?

01:26:00.113 --> 01:26:01.774
It will be tonight.

01:26:02.324 --> 01:26:07.535
Well, if you need my assistance
in any way, I can help.

01:26:08.580 --> 01:26:10.321
That's what I pay you for.

01:26:14.628 --> 01:26:18.997
So, um... why did you call me over?

01:26:19.132 --> 01:26:21.965
I have some papers
I wanted you to witness.

01:26:24.096 --> 01:26:25.461
Of course.

01:26:36.900 --> 01:26:38.482
<i>Mm...</i>

01:26:38.610 --> 01:26:41.602
I'd forgotten how simple
your signature is.

01:26:41.738 --> 01:26:44.321
AG. Like silver.

01:26:47.828 --> 01:26:49.239
Serebro.

01:26:51.123 --> 01:26:52.363
Yes, you are.

01:27:12.436 --> 01:27:14.677
<i>That little girl became blind.</i>

01:27:19.651 --> 01:27:21.562
<i>They never told you, did they?</i>

01:27:23.363 --> 01:27:26.651
<i>Stop me, Sofia. I want you to stop me.</i>

01:28:10.118 --> 01:28:11.859
<i>You know where I live.</i>

01:29:14.933 --> 01:29:16.765
Car's ready.

01:29:21.648 --> 01:29:22.763
He knows.

01:29:23.692 --> 01:29:24.727
All of it?

01:29:25.944 --> 01:29:27.605
Sofia?

01:29:27.737 --> 01:29:28.772
All of it.

01:29:30.866 --> 01:29:35.781
Marc, it's too late for her
but it's not for me. For us.

01:29:36.580 --> 01:29:41.290
I'm a dead woman if you don't help me
get out of here right now.

01:29:43.086 --> 01:29:47.045
Get to the airport. You'll make it.

01:29:47.173 --> 01:29:49.039
Please.

01:29:49.175 --> 01:29:53.760
Blood is blood.
You can't turn your back on that.

01:30:05.025 --> 01:30:06.436
Blood is blood.

01:31:36.491 --> 01:31:39.153
I never came here
when Veronique lived here.

01:31:40.704 --> 01:31:46.040
Two daughters living under and above
each other, both plotting to end me.

01:31:53.717 --> 01:31:55.253
You're not scared of me?

01:31:59.347 --> 01:32:02.385
I've been killing you every day
for the last 24 years.

01:32:02.517 --> 01:32:04.679
There's nothing to be scared of.

01:32:06.021 --> 01:32:08.228
It's not going to end that way.

01:34:03.638 --> 01:34:04.969
No!

01:34:32.750 --> 01:34:34.240
I had him. He was mine.

01:34:34.377 --> 01:34:35.663
Yeah.

01:34:35.795 --> 01:34:38.253
You'd have regretted it
for the rest of your life.

01:36:00.630 --> 01:36:03.964
No. There's no time.

01:36:15.937 --> 01:36:17.803
You can't save everyone.

01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:47.882
Don't let me see you leave.
