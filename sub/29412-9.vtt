10:48.982 --> 10:50.650
I was in surgery.
Craniotomy.

10:52.185 --> 10:55.155
Now I have two consults,
a meeting with a donor,

10:55.188 --> 10:56.757

Well, don't forget
to eat something.

Yeah.
Sorry, I'm just busy.

11:16.777 --> 11:18.345
DR. PARK: We're recommending
the stent.

11:18.378 --> 11:21.949
It risks clotting,
but it's also less invasive
than the graft.

11:21.982 --> 11:24.584
The graft would be
a more permanent repair,

11:24.617 --> 11:27.320
but there's greater chance
of surgical complications.

How much time does
a couple actually
spend having sex?

12:09.696 --> 12:12.732
19 minutes per week,
including foreplay.

That's the real
relationship.

and cheaters and idiots.

12:28.748 --> 12:30.417
It might start
relationships,

12:30.450 --> 12:32.419

it rips them apart.

12:32.452 --> 12:34.254
She got devastating news

12:34.287 --> 12:37.257
and made an emotional decision
without thinking it through.

12:37.290 --> 12:39.559
The least we can do
is get her counseling.

12:39.592 --> 12:41.929
Was she offered counseling
when you gave her
the diagnosis?

reeling from the...

that the kind of person

more as a project

I'm going out with him
'cause he's a great guy

that someone needs

20:30.096 --> 20:33.032

22:21.441 --> 22:25.244
Last summer,
we went camping
in Yosemite.

22:25.277 --> 22:29.516
We decided to rough it
by only packing
P.B. and J sandwiches.

22:29.549 --> 22:31.751
The first night,
a bear rips into our tent

22:31.784 --> 22:33.285
and devours them.

22:33.319 --> 22:35.755
And the next night, of course,
we had this hole in our tent,

22:35.788 --> 22:39.826
and the mosquitos
just ate us alive.

22:39.859 --> 22:41.193
(CHUCKLES)

22:41.227 --> 22:43.362
And the bug spray
that we thought we packed?

22:44.464 --> 22:45.998
It was sunscreen.

22:46.032 --> 22:47.634
And then
when it started pouring,

22:47.667 --> 22:50.169
we turned to each other
at the same time and we said,

22:51.370 --> 22:52.371
"Denny's."

22:53.239 --> 22:54.774
(CHUCKLES)

22:54.807 --> 22:56.809
And that's when I knew
I wanted to marry her.

22:56.843 --> 22:57.977
Great.

23:00.580 --> 23:03.783
That was a memory
of something you got
through together,

23:03.816 --> 23:05.652
not about the time
you had a threesome
in Miami.

23:07.420 --> 23:08.721
It was New Orleans.

23:10.089 --> 23:12.358
The threesome
was in New Orleans,
not Miami.

23:12.391 --> 23:14.994
And it was way better
than the bear trip.

23:16.429 --> 23:18.397
But I wasn't gonna tell
my fiancee's doctor about it.

23:19.432 --> 23:22.702
Sex...makes you real
with someone.

23:22.735 --> 23:24.036
Sex makes you stupid.

23:26.873 --> 23:29.175
I had the perfect man.

23:29.208 --> 23:33.412
He was...smart
and funny.

23:33.446 --> 23:36.182
He squeezed the sponge
after washing the dishes.

23:36.215 --> 23:37.249
(CHUCKLES LIGHTLY)

23:39.752 --> 23:43.690
Then one night,
I-I met some guy
and I had a few drinks,

23:43.723 --> 23:45.592
and, um...

23:45.625 --> 23:47.927
I got all tingly
and got really stupid.

23:48.928 --> 23:50.196
Never saw him again.

23:52.298 --> 23:53.432
Or my boyfriend.

23:55.468 --> 23:58.404
Sex can make us feel
incredibly close to someone...

24:00.206 --> 24:02.374
Honest,

24:02.408 --> 24:03.610
vulnerable.

24:06.345 --> 24:08.548
But sex is not
the goal.

24:10.817 --> 24:12.451
All the rest
of those things are.

24:13.986 --> 24:16.288
**

24:17.757 --> 24:18.991
She's the love
of my life.

24:20.159 --> 24:22.629
And I always thought
that we were strong

24:22.662 --> 24:24.997
and that we can overcome
anything together.

24:27.500 --> 24:29.001
But without sex...

24:31.237 --> 24:33.339
I don't know if...

24:33.372 --> 24:34.841
If we have enough.

24:36.008 --> 24:38.711
**

24:38.745 --> 24:39.979
Okay.

24:43.816 --> 24:45.251
Then you need to lie
to her.

24:49.856 --> 24:51.490
Nurse said you'd be here
an hour ago.

24:52.458 --> 24:54.460
Yeah, well,
you're not my only patient.

24:56.863 --> 24:58.297
Look, I get it.

24:58.330 --> 25:00.900
This is about
as awkward as it gets.

25:00.933 --> 25:02.334
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

25:02.368 --> 25:03.369
Yes, it is.

25:06.005 --> 25:07.774
You know,
I almost died
in that accident.

25:13.012 --> 25:16.182
When I woke up, all I could
think about was my wife,

25:16.215 --> 25:18.417
and my little girl,

25:18.450 --> 25:21.453
and how much of an ass
I'd been
and how hurt they'd be.

25:24.523 --> 25:26.192
So, why is it
that once I get
out of here,

25:26.225 --> 25:27.727
I'm gonna keep cheating
on them?

25:29.028 --> 25:30.229
I can't help it.

25:31.397 --> 25:34.033
No matter how much
remorse or guilt...

25:35.568 --> 25:38.037
(VOICE BREAKING)
I feel like
I always give in.

25:38.070 --> 25:39.471
Then you should
leave them.

25:39.505 --> 25:41.207
I can't.

25:41.240 --> 25:42.341
I love them.

25:42.374 --> 25:43.542
(SCOFFS)

25:44.877 --> 25:46.946
How messed up
is that, right?

25:46.979 --> 25:48.848
**

25:51.918 --> 25:53.185
But I think you know.

25:54.486 --> 25:56.555
Yeah, well,
I don't cheat.

25:56.589 --> 25:58.424
I saw you checking me out
in the bar.

25:59.425 --> 26:01.027
My left hand,

26:01.060 --> 26:04.030
just making sure
I was married.

26:09.168 --> 26:11.704
You're just as big
a cheater as me,
Dr. Browne.

26:11.738 --> 26:13.906
**

26:16.909 --> 26:18.077
My, uh, leg...

26:19.311 --> 26:20.346
It's... It's cold.

26:20.880 --> 26:23.449
**

26:34.794 --> 26:36.395
No pulse.

26:36.428 --> 26:39.098
Your stent has formed a clot.
We need an angio, stat!

26:43.535 --> 26:45.404
Everything okay?

26:45.437 --> 26:47.373
You haven't said a word
since "Pass the salt."

26:49.876 --> 26:51.110
It's about Shaun,
isn't it?

26:55.414 --> 26:57.016
Two weeks ago,

26:57.049 --> 26:59.886
you asked me to give him
romantic advice,

26:59.919 --> 27:01.453
which I didn't want
to do.

27:01.487 --> 27:04.791
And then he comes
into my office
for romantic advice,

27:04.824 --> 27:06.192
and you kick him
right out.

27:06.225 --> 27:07.760
It's because
you're helping him
too much.

27:07.794 --> 27:09.528
He is completely
dependent on you.

27:09.561 --> 27:10.797
For good reason.

27:10.830 --> 27:13.065
He hasn't spoken
to his parents
since he was 14.

27:13.099 --> 27:15.101
The only person
he cared about

27:15.134 --> 27:17.236
died right in front
of his eyes.

27:17.269 --> 27:19.939
Aaron, I know
how much you love him.

27:21.640 --> 27:25.077
How you hate to see him
struggle, fail, get hurt.

27:26.645 --> 27:29.248
(CHUCKLES LIGHTLY)
But you need to let him.

27:29.281 --> 27:30.482
And he'll be okay.

27:31.483 --> 27:33.853
Because he has someone else
in his life now.

27:35.121 --> 27:36.789
Just like you do.

27:36.823 --> 27:39.025
**

27:40.659 --> 27:43.295
Placing guide wire
through the needle.

27:44.463 --> 27:45.531
Placing catheter.

27:47.533 --> 27:48.701
So, how do you know
this guy?

27:50.002 --> 27:51.337
You knew
he was on MDMA,

27:51.370 --> 27:52.972
you've been avoiding him
since he arrived,

27:53.005 --> 27:55.742
and...I checked
on his accident.

27:55.775 --> 27:57.276
It was a half mile
from your place.

27:59.846 --> 28:01.680
I was with him
the night before
the accident,

28:01.714 --> 28:02.982
but it's not relevant.

28:03.015 --> 28:04.283
It hasn't affected
my judgement.

28:04.316 --> 28:05.484
Yes, it has.

28:05.517 --> 28:06.819
If you hadn't been
avoiding him,

28:06.853 --> 28:08.120
we could've
caught the clot earlier.

28:11.858 --> 28:13.960
I figure you've been
going through
something lately.

28:15.661 --> 28:17.129
Something
that's really hurt you.

28:19.065 --> 28:22.434
And maybe it's making
you turn to things you
normally wouldn't.

28:22.468 --> 28:23.669
(SCOFFS)

28:23.702 --> 28:25.537
But some of the guys you meet
are gonna be trouble,

28:25.571 --> 28:27.106
some are gonna be married,
some are gonna...

28:27.139 --> 28:28.908
He took a vow, not me.

28:29.408 --> 28:31.677
**

28:34.080 --> 28:35.714
That's the exact attitude
someone had

28:35.748 --> 28:37.149
when they helped
ruin my life.

28:38.517 --> 28:39.518
There's the clot.

28:43.389 --> 28:44.957
Activating angio jet.

28:44.991 --> 28:46.826
**

28:48.027 --> 28:49.328
It's too big to bust.

28:49.361 --> 28:50.696
We have to
open him up.

28:52.598 --> 28:55.067
You said to accept things
I don't like, but Jeanie said

28:55.101 --> 28:57.236
I have to share everything,
and I don't know...
Shaun. Shaun.

28:57.269 --> 28:58.404
Shaun,
stop, stop, stop.

28:58.437 --> 29:00.039
(SIGHS)

29:00.072 --> 29:02.241
I have to go home.

29:02.274 --> 29:05.077
I can walk you to your car.
Is it very far?

29:05.111 --> 29:07.413
I think this discussion
will take at least 15 minutes,

29:07.446 --> 29:09.048
so maybe
you can drive me?

29:09.081 --> 29:10.749
We have to
set boundaries, okay?

29:10.783 --> 29:12.351
We have to set
some limits.

29:12.384 --> 29:14.921
You can't just come over
6:30 in the morning,

29:14.954 --> 29:16.655
uh, uh, for flower advice.

29:16.688 --> 29:19.091
You can't just pop into
my office anytime you want.

29:19.125 --> 29:20.659
Is this because
of Debbie?

29:20.692 --> 29:22.128
No. Yes.

29:26.732 --> 29:27.867
And I agree with her.

29:29.768 --> 29:31.670
It was different when it was
just the two of us,

29:31.703 --> 29:33.739
but now we have people
in our lives...

29:33.772 --> 29:35.241
Both of us.

29:35.274 --> 29:37.043
We have to make them
the priority.

29:38.878 --> 29:42.448
Does this mean
we can't talk anymore?

29:42.481 --> 29:44.550
No, of course
we can talk. Of...

29:45.784 --> 29:48.254
It's just that there's
a time and a place
for everything.

29:48.287 --> 29:51.423
And this is
the wrong time and place?

29:51.457 --> 29:53.792

29:57.729 --> 29:58.998
Yeah.

35:11.210 --> 35:12.644
It's not the tattoo.

35:13.145 --> 35:15.614
**

35:28.927 --> 35:31.497
We were able to restore
blood flow to his legs.

35:31.530 --> 35:32.598
He's gonna
be just fine.

(EXHALES SHARPLY)

35:34.132 --> 35:35.534
Thank you so much,
Dr. Browne.

35:38.170 --> 35:40.472
Now that
he's out of the woods,

35:40.506 --> 35:43.775
you don't need to feel guilty
about questioning him.

35:43.809 --> 35:47.012
All the pain, paranoia,
and self-doubt...

35:48.013 --> 35:49.315
You deserve
to know the truth.

35:50.616 --> 35:51.817
He's just gonna deny it.

35:54.486 --> 35:56.087
Then you need to insist.

(SIGHS)

35:59.291 --> 36:01.327
**

36:16.342 --> 36:18.210
Our relationship
was a stupid idea.

36:19.044 --> 36:20.946
Which made ending it
a smart idea.

36:21.580 --> 36:22.814
Simple, binary...

36:24.015 --> 36:25.116
And naive.

36:28.720 --> 36:31.223
I really underestimated
how hard this would be.

36:32.591 --> 36:34.560
**

36:36.127 --> 36:38.930
Yes, I've been having
second thoughts.

36:38.964 --> 36:40.499
I'm not saying we should
get back together...

36:40.532 --> 36:41.967
What are you saying?

36:44.903 --> 36:45.971
I don't know.

36:48.340 --> 36:49.341
Good.

36:51.743 --> 36:55.381
It's...good to know
that it's not easy.

36:58.183 --> 36:59.618
It's good to know
that it mattered.

36:59.651 --> 37:02.354
**

37:12.831 --> 37:14.700
Intimacy isn't
about a tattoo.

37:16.402 --> 37:19.571
And it's not about
touching or kissing

37:19.605 --> 37:21.840
or...even sex.

37:24.276 --> 37:28.380
It's about sharing
your biggest fears.

37:30.749 --> 37:31.750
Yes.

37:34.286 --> 37:35.587
What are you scared of?

37:39.124 --> 37:41.427
I love
being a pathologist.

37:44.363 --> 37:46.732
But every day
I walk into the lab,

37:46.765 --> 37:49.034
I am filled with doubt.

37:49.067 --> 37:51.370
Am I smart enough?
Am I capable enough?

37:51.403 --> 37:53.639
Do I really deserve
to be here?

37:54.940 --> 37:59.077
How long until
someone walks in
and exposes my fraud

37:59.110 --> 38:00.879
and has me removed
from the premises?

38:02.548 --> 38:04.650
Eventually,
those thoughts retreat.

38:06.284 --> 38:07.419
Until the next morning,

38:07.453 --> 38:09.488
when they all come crashing
back into my brain.

38:12.791 --> 38:14.292
That and pigeons.

38:15.727 --> 38:16.962
They freak me out.

38:17.896 --> 38:19.631
Hmm.

38:19.665 --> 38:21.967
**

38:24.302 --> 38:26.071
My biggest fear...

38:28.974 --> 38:30.609
...is that I'll be alone.

38:35.046 --> 38:37.849
If I don't get over this,
you'll leave.

38:38.484 --> 38:40.819
**

39:07.779 --> 39:09.114
We don't
have to have sex.

39:12.217 --> 39:14.986
Can we just hold each other
for a little bit?

39:15.854 --> 39:17.322

You should go.

40:40.906 --> 40:42.340
I don't know. Maybe.

40:42.373 --> 40:43.775
It can wait
till tomorrow morning.

40:45.310 --> 40:46.778
Eh, you were right.

40:48.413 --> 40:50.048
Everything you said
was right.
