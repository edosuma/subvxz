WEBVTT

00:04.505 --> 00:05.756
CONNOR: I think you killed my father.

00:05.840 --> 00:08.676
Give me an hour to get to O'Hare.
You'll never see me again.

00:08.759 --> 00:10.720
-No.
-We could've been so happy.

00:11.220 --> 00:12.555
No! No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:12.638 --> 00:13.723
I need help in here!

00:14.306 --> 00:15.307
CONNOR: I'm leaving Med.

00:15.391 --> 00:17.810
I... I'm never gonna be able
to get past what happened here.

00:18.394 --> 00:19.645
I need a fresh start.

00:20.354 --> 00:22.064
I heard Dr. Manning was in an accident?

00:22.148 --> 00:23.524
-Dr. Marcel.
-Who are you?

00:23.607 --> 00:25.109
I'm her fiancÃ©.

00:25.735 --> 00:27.528
I'm so sorry, Natalie.

00:27.611 --> 00:28.904
What are you doing here?

00:28.988 --> 00:30.406
I don't want you coming around here again.

00:30.865 --> 00:32.450
-We're getting married.
-What?

00:32.533 --> 00:35.035
NATALIE: I don't remember
you asking me to marry you.

00:35.119 --> 00:36.245
PHILLIP: You will.

00:36.328 --> 00:39.790
MAGGIE: They found a mass.
Metastatic adenocarcinoma.

00:39.874 --> 00:41.250
I don't want anyone to know.

00:42.543 --> 00:44.420
I don't wanna be the sick person.

00:46.589 --> 00:47.631
(THUNDER CRACKS)

00:51.719 --> 00:54.180
God, when is it gonna stop?

00:54.930 --> 00:57.767
Hey, um, I'm sorry. I think it's empty.

00:57.850 --> 01:00.060
Oh. Hold on, I need to get you unhooked.

01:02.313 --> 01:04.774
-I just don't wanna be late for work.
-Work?

01:04.857 --> 01:06.525
You just got a bag of chemo.

01:06.984 --> 01:09.236
You need to go home and get some rest.

01:09.320 --> 01:13.449
Uh-uh. It's my friend's first
day back after an injury.

01:13.532 --> 01:15.159
And besides I have an ED to run.

01:15.242 --> 01:16.827
-At Med?
-Yeah.

01:16.911 --> 01:18.746
They have a huge infusion center.

01:18.829 --> 01:20.498
You don't have to come
all the way over here.

01:21.415 --> 01:23.417
I like to keep things separate.

01:23.501 --> 01:26.629
And besides,
I love what you're doing with the donuts.

01:27.713 --> 01:29.924
Careful if you're driving.
Roads are a mess.

01:30.007 --> 01:31.342
Yeah, thanks!

01:31.926 --> 01:33.803
ETHAN: The third year
of med school will not only be

01:33.886 --> 01:37.139
the most difficult of your lives,
but also the most important.

01:37.223 --> 01:39.850
Anyone know how many patients
come through our ED in a single year?

01:39.934 --> 01:44.814
105,000. It's 18,000 acute,
and 4,600 active traumas.

01:45.397 --> 01:46.565
That's right.

01:47.149 --> 01:48.776
You thinking about going into ED med?

01:48.859 --> 01:50.319
Is there anything else?

01:50.903 --> 01:52.071
(CHUCKLES)

01:52.154 --> 01:53.614
Anyway, for each of you,

01:53.697 --> 01:57.952
the ED will be both a challenge
and an opportunity to sharpen your skills.

01:58.577 --> 02:00.621
He loves giving this lecture, doesn't he?

02:00.704 --> 02:03.374
He's the only one who volunteers.
Every single year.

02:08.087 --> 02:10.589
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought I had a patient.

02:10.673 --> 02:11.924
Hmm?

02:12.007 --> 02:13.175
Are you okay?

02:13.259 --> 02:15.761
Yeah, just got shanghaied
onto the day shift.

02:15.845 --> 02:17.805
Late nights, a little pick-me-up.

02:18.305 --> 02:21.433
-Crockett Marcel, fourth year, surgery.
-Oh.

02:23.185 --> 02:24.186
Noah Sexton.

02:24.270 --> 02:26.730
Nice to meet you, Noah Sexton.
You mind?

02:27.731 --> 02:30.150
-Sure.
-Teamwork.

02:31.277 --> 02:34.488
So, future ED doctor, I presume?

02:35.072 --> 02:37.658
No. I mean, yes. But...

02:38.450 --> 02:42.663
Well, my real plan is to open
some Urgent Cares after residency

02:42.746 --> 02:45.249
and try to build a brand.
Maybe take it public.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.376
Sounds ambitious.

02:47.918 --> 02:49.086
Then again...

02:50.212 --> 02:53.465
I don't even know how you folks manage
to start so soon after last call.

02:54.425 --> 02:57.094
Hmm. Well, see you around.

03:00.890 --> 03:03.767
Oh-ho-ho! First day of school.

03:04.727 --> 03:06.186
Dang, how long we been doing this for?

03:06.270 --> 03:09.189
Long enough, you should know
to get a better umbrella.

03:09.273 --> 03:11.066
Are you aware that in some cultures,

03:11.150 --> 03:14.403
-a downpour is considered very good luck?
-Really?

03:14.486 --> 03:16.030
-Yeah.
-Which cultures?

03:16.572 --> 03:19.283
I don't know.
Dry places? Yemen?

03:19.867 --> 03:20.868
Oh!

03:21.452 --> 03:23.245
-MAN: Relax.
-The power must've gone out.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.457
The back-up generator's kicking in.

03:27.750 --> 03:30.336
I better go talk engineering.
I'll see you later.

03:30.419 --> 03:31.795
See ya.

03:32.379 --> 03:35.633
We must not be moving patients fast enough
if they had time to deliver these.

03:36.342 --> 03:37.593
Nice.

03:37.676 --> 03:39.345
Actually, they're for Natalie.

03:40.304 --> 03:41.764
They're from Phillip.

03:44.266 --> 03:45.893
It's her first day back and all.

03:47.478 --> 03:48.687
Oh.

03:49.855 --> 03:52.107
Well, I'm sure they'll look great
on her kitchen table.

03:53.233 --> 03:54.234
Yeah.

03:58.489 --> 03:59.865
-Usually, we would...
-Dr. Choi!

03:59.949 --> 04:01.825
An ambulance skidded out
a couple blocks away. They need help.

04:01.909 --> 04:03.702
-I'm on it.
-Me too.

04:03.786 --> 04:05.704
-You in?
-Yeah.

04:07.081 --> 04:09.041
ETHAN: Hey, Capp! Anybody hurt?

04:09.124 --> 04:11.794
Driver here is okay.
That the ambo?

04:11.877 --> 04:13.504
Patient's stable,
older guy with chest pain.

04:13.587 --> 04:15.547
But the paramedic got it bad.

04:15.631 --> 04:17.925
-He still in there?
-We're getting him out now.

04:18.008 --> 04:20.177
(SAW WHIRRING)

04:32.564 --> 04:33.941
Help!

04:36.568 --> 04:38.070
(GASPING)

04:40.406 --> 04:42.032
Hang on!

04:42.741 --> 04:43.826
Please!

04:43.909 --> 04:45.577
FIREMAN: All right. Nice and easy.

04:47.287 --> 04:48.497
Is anyone injured?

04:49.623 --> 04:51.208
(SCREAMING)

04:53.711 --> 04:55.629
Ready? One, two, three.

04:56.672 --> 04:57.840
Got him.

04:59.383 --> 05:01.677
Darren?
Darren, what happened?

05:02.261 --> 05:04.013
I smashed my hip.

05:04.471 --> 05:07.099
-One to ten, how's the pain?
-Oh, man, it's a ten.

05:07.182 --> 05:08.767
He's tachycardic and his pulse is thready.

05:08.851 --> 05:10.310
You think it's broken?

05:10.394 --> 05:11.812
(SCREAMS) God!

05:11.895 --> 05:13.188
We gotta go. Let's go, let's go!

05:13.772 --> 05:16.191
Hang in there, Darren.
We're getting you to Med.

05:16.984 --> 05:19.862
-Darren. Darren?
-What's happening?

05:19.945 --> 05:21.780
He's bleeding out into his pelvis.
We gotta go!

05:21.864 --> 05:23.073
Easy, easy.

05:23.157 --> 05:24.283
MAN: This is Mister Lentz.

05:24.366 --> 05:26.285
Mr. Lentz. What's going on?

05:28.746 --> 05:29.997
Pain in my chest.

05:30.080 --> 05:31.457
It's all right. We got you.

05:33.333 --> 05:34.668
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

05:35.252 --> 05:37.171
-Come on. Come on, come on, come on.
-Yeah.

05:38.630 --> 05:39.673
Let's go!

05:48.724 --> 05:49.725
Baghdad.

05:49.808 --> 05:50.934
Pressure in two units O positive,

05:51.018 --> 05:52.895
get a pelvic binder,
then activate the MTP.

05:53.479 --> 05:55.439
Tachycardic and hypotensive.
Steve, what's your plan?

05:55.522 --> 05:58.233
Bind his pelvis, we need X-rays
and CT to confirm,

05:58.317 --> 05:59.693
then interventional radiology
to embolize the bleeders.

05:59.777 --> 06:02.112
Good. Let's transfer on my count.

06:03.405 --> 06:05.324
-Everybody ready?
-Yeah.

06:05.407 --> 06:07.367
One, two, three.

06:07.451 --> 06:09.745
Trauma labs, ABG, chest and pelvic X-ray.

06:10.454 --> 06:12.456
Pelvic binder. Blood's on the way.

06:12.539 --> 06:13.832
-Okay, let's get ready to roll.
-Yeah.

06:13.916 --> 06:15.000
Roll.

06:16.460 --> 06:18.754
Tell me as soon as you get the scans.
I'll let IR know we're coming up.

06:18.837 --> 06:20.047
Okay.

06:22.257 --> 06:23.509
Back.

06:29.431 --> 06:32.559
Okay, he's good. Bolus a liter of saline.
I think we're gonna be in good shape.

06:32.643 --> 06:34.645
Hold on. Let me get you guys
some dry scrubs.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.313
No, no, no. I'm fine.

06:57.126 --> 07:01.922
-Oh, look who decided to show up!
-Hey!

07:02.005 --> 07:03.590
Must be good to be back.

07:03.674 --> 07:06.301
-Much better than sitting around at home.
-I bet.

07:06.385 --> 07:07.427
How's Phillip?

07:07.511 --> 07:09.096
Phillip's great.

07:09.179 --> 07:11.265
He's been really helping out with Owen,

07:11.348 --> 07:13.767
giving me time to heal and rest.

07:14.518 --> 07:15.519
But?

07:16.103 --> 07:17.771
-But what?
-Nat...

07:19.898 --> 07:22.776
Well, Dr. Abrams said that
I would have memory loss.

07:22.860 --> 07:26.321
And that the loss might
include some feelings.

07:27.406 --> 07:30.159
I don't know, I guess I'm just
excited for them to come back.

07:30.659 --> 07:31.660
Yeah.

07:32.494 --> 07:35.122
Anyway, how are you?
How was your vacation?

07:35.205 --> 07:39.877
Oh, it was just fine. You know,
just a little me time to recharge.

07:40.752 --> 07:41.879
-Natalie!
-Yeah.

07:41.962 --> 07:44.006
-It's good to see you well.
-Thanks, Jim.

07:44.590 --> 07:45.591
Four weeks, though seems a little soon

07:45.674 --> 07:47.384
to come back from
a traumatic brain injury.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.720
Well, Dr. Abrams did clear me.

07:50.304 --> 07:52.097
Well, Sam likes to get patients
off his service.

07:52.181 --> 07:54.057
Let's do a half-shift today.

07:54.141 --> 07:56.476
H and P's only.
Probably best just to ease back in.

07:56.560 --> 07:58.854
No, I don't think that's necessary.

08:00.272 --> 08:03.942
Doesn't look too bad,
70% stenosis in two vessels.

08:04.026 --> 08:07.321
He's stable from the nitro,
so I think we can treat conservatively.

08:07.863 --> 08:10.657
Spoken like a true
future urgent care mogul.

08:10.741 --> 08:12.492
See? I listen.

08:12.576 --> 08:15.329
Mr. Lentz, no injuries
from the ambo crash, I hear.

08:15.412 --> 08:18.999
Gone over your CAT. I'd like to schedule
you for coronary artery bypass surgery.

08:19.082 --> 08:20.542
Preferably today.

08:21.877 --> 08:25.505
But Dr. Marcel, the medicine worked.

08:25.589 --> 08:27.090
I... I feel fine.

08:27.174 --> 08:29.885
I understand. But you did suffer
a heart attack this morning.

08:29.968 --> 08:31.386
I'd like to prevent you
from having another.

08:32.888 --> 08:34.932
There must be other ways.

08:35.015 --> 08:39.770
We could talk about other medical options.
Or possibly revisit a stent down the road.

08:39.853 --> 08:42.606
None of which, in my opinion,
will solve the problem.

08:43.815 --> 08:45.859
Now, I know this is not
what you were expecting...

08:45.943 --> 08:46.944
Dr. Marcel...

08:47.027 --> 08:49.029
But I do ask you that you trust me
when I say that

08:49.112 --> 08:52.532
you might be one cheeseburger
away from a far worse event

08:52.616 --> 08:54.117
than the one you experienced this morning.

08:58.288 --> 09:00.249
You really think so?

09:00.332 --> 09:01.458
Yes, I do.

09:02.584 --> 09:04.336
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

09:05.963 --> 09:10.175
Well, if... If you say so.

09:12.302 --> 09:13.762
-Okay.
-Good.

09:14.388 --> 09:16.848
I'll talk to Dr. Latham,
Chief of CT Surgery,

09:16.932 --> 09:18.558
and I'll get back to you
with those details.

09:22.938 --> 09:24.523
Dr. Sexton?

09:24.606 --> 09:28.360
Yeah, you kinda gave him
a hard sell on a surgery.

09:28.944 --> 09:31.113
We should really give him all his options.

09:32.114 --> 09:33.323
Hold on.

09:33.407 --> 09:37.577
70% stenosis on a cath
means a 95% blockage in three dimensions.

09:37.661 --> 09:39.705
Coupled with a decreased LVF,

09:39.788 --> 09:43.458
I'd say his only other option
right now is dying.

09:47.671 --> 09:49.256
Why don't you come up and observe?

09:51.174 --> 09:52.384
Might be illuminating.

09:54.761 --> 09:57.347
Yeah, Dr. Latham?

10:00.642 --> 10:03.270
Hi, Lacey, I'm Dr. Halstead,
this is student Dr. Curry.

10:03.353 --> 10:05.230
-Hi.
-I hear you had a seizure at school today?

10:05.314 --> 10:06.815
Yeah. In the middle of calculus.

10:07.524 --> 10:09.151
-Has that ever happened before?
-No.

10:10.861 --> 10:12.571
Any idea what caused it?

10:12.654 --> 10:14.906
Maybe the giant gas leak in our school.

10:14.990 --> 10:17.576
-We've been smelling it for weeks.
-And no one's fixed it?

10:17.659 --> 10:19.745
No. And I've been getting dizzy,

10:19.828 --> 10:22.372
and nauseous,
and now I can't stop doing this.

10:24.583 --> 10:27.502
-And the soccer state finals are tomorrow.
-Yeah. Is she gonna be okay?

10:28.670 --> 10:30.297
The arm motions, when did those start?

10:30.380 --> 10:32.257
Today. After the seizure.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.593
Hmm. Okay.

10:35.177 --> 10:37.554
-Have either of you had any symptoms?
-Nothing.

10:37.637 --> 10:40.849
Do you have any history
of head injuries or trauma?

10:40.932 --> 10:43.101
No. It's a gas leak.

10:43.185 --> 10:45.020
Can't you just test the air,
or my blood, or something?

10:45.103 --> 10:46.480
That's exactly what we're gonna do.

10:46.563 --> 10:48.648
Let me run some tests
and talk to your school

10:48.732 --> 10:50.317
while Miss Curry does a quick neuro exam.

10:50.901 --> 10:52.778
-I need to get better.
-WILL: Understood.

10:52.861 --> 10:54.321
We're gonna take good care of you.

10:57.366 --> 10:58.825
Hey, we didn't have a nurse in there.

10:58.909 --> 11:02.621
Can you get someone to drop a CVC, CMP,
and start on IV influence.

11:02.704 --> 11:04.039
I got it.

11:11.838 --> 11:13.006
Hey.

11:13.340 --> 11:15.509
Hey. Welcome back.

11:15.592 --> 11:16.635
Thanks.

11:17.219 --> 11:19.888
You go away for a few weeks,
and everything's different.

11:20.472 --> 11:24.393
Connor's left.
And Ava? Oh, my God...

11:24.476 --> 11:26.603
Yeah. That was a horrible shock.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.105
Ugh.

11:29.106 --> 11:30.232
You look good.

11:30.315 --> 11:33.568
-I mean, you know, you healed up well.
-Yeah.

11:35.362 --> 11:36.655
And the concussion?

11:36.738 --> 11:39.241
-Yeah, I'm taking it slowly.
-You sure?

11:43.578 --> 11:44.663
Glad to have you back.

11:47.624 --> 11:48.625
Hey. Hey, Will?

11:51.378 --> 11:52.754
Yeah?

11:53.255 --> 11:55.590
I'm sorry you had to find out
the way you did.

11:57.259 --> 11:59.094
About me and Phillip getting engaged.

12:00.887 --> 12:03.473
But I guess that's what
I was coming to your car to tell you.

12:04.474 --> 12:05.475
Right.

12:06.601 --> 12:09.104
I mean, I don't remember
a lot from that day, but...

12:11.148 --> 12:12.524
It makes sense.

12:16.153 --> 12:19.823
-I got a kid with a gunshot wound.
-T1. Dr. Lanik.

12:20.532 --> 12:22.826
Taylor Holmes, 16, shot once
through the right forearm

12:22.909 --> 12:25.871
and into the flank. BP 130 over 60.
Heart rate 95.

12:25.954 --> 12:28.623
They shot me. Somebody shot me.

12:29.291 --> 12:30.375
(GROANS)

12:30.459 --> 12:32.461
All right. Let's move him.
One, two, three.

12:32.544 --> 12:33.920
(GROANS)

12:34.838 --> 12:36.339
So what happened out there?

12:36.423 --> 12:39.426
I don't know. I was just waiting
for the bus. Am I in trouble?

12:39.509 --> 12:41.344
There's no law against getting shot.

12:41.428 --> 12:43.388
Active bleeding from his flank.

12:43.472 --> 12:46.183
-Let's get some four-by-four dressings.
-It's okay. I got this.

12:48.143 --> 12:50.437
-Does it hurt anywhere else?
-Uh-uh.

12:50.520 --> 12:51.980
Can somebody call my mom?

12:52.063 --> 12:53.315
Don't worry. We will.

12:53.398 --> 12:55.901
Okay. Got the brachial.
Hemostat times two.

12:55.984 --> 12:57.319
I'll apply pressure.
Get me some suction.

12:57.903 --> 12:59.321
We're fine. Doris?

12:59.905 --> 13:00.947
DORIS: Hemostat.

13:05.035 --> 13:06.036
(GROANING)

13:08.121 --> 13:09.664
See? Easy-peasy.

13:10.415 --> 13:11.917
Your artery's clamped,
but your flank wound is still bleeding.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.377
-So we gotta get you up to surgery.
-I need an operation?

13:14.461 --> 13:15.921
Yes, you do. It'll fix you up.

13:16.505 --> 13:17.881
Dr. Manning will take you
right up in a minute.

13:17.964 --> 13:20.050
-You want me to transfer him? Wait...
-And write the note. Thanks.

13:24.262 --> 13:25.514
All right, let's move.

13:33.313 --> 13:34.523
I'll take it from here.

13:37.734 --> 13:39.611
Hey, where you going?

13:40.362 --> 13:41.821
Lanik's having me do transpo.

13:42.656 --> 13:43.740
Are you serious?

13:43.823 --> 13:45.951
Anything to keep me
from practicing medicine.

13:46.034 --> 13:48.203
Huh. Well, welcome back, Dr. Manning.

13:48.954 --> 13:50.205
Thanks.

13:56.002 --> 13:58.255
MARCEL: Any word on when Dr. Latham's
coming back in?

13:58.338 --> 13:59.923
FEMALE DOCTOR: He's still stuck in OR 12.

14:00.006 --> 14:01.466
MARCEL: Can I get some suction, please?

14:03.051 --> 14:05.679
All right, then. Let's suture.

14:07.347 --> 14:08.598
My first day,

14:09.975 --> 14:12.018
I'm taking this woman's history
out in the chairs,

14:12.102 --> 14:15.146
when I feel this warm liquid
all over my leg.

14:15.230 --> 14:19.651
And I'm like, did she just pee on me?
But I keep going, until she says,

14:19.734 --> 14:21.695
when are you gonna ask about my baby?

14:22.279 --> 14:24.239
And I realize that her water just broke.

14:24.322 --> 14:25.865
But before I can say anything,

14:25.949 --> 14:30.203
she passes out cold, because now
she's in a total eclamptic crisis.

14:32.038 --> 14:33.623
What... What happened?

14:34.457 --> 14:36.751
MARCEL: Whoa. Everybody, freeze.

14:38.545 --> 14:41.715
Power must've gone out.
Those are the emergency lights.

14:41.798 --> 14:43.717
But the backup generator
should kick in any second.

14:43.800 --> 14:44.801
MARCEL: Where are we at?

14:44.884 --> 14:46.595
-DOCTOR 1: I got nothing.
-Suction's out.

14:46.678 --> 14:49.514
DOCTOR 2: Bypass is on battery,
not sure how long we got.

14:49.598 --> 14:51.433
MARCEL: Okay. I'm sure
somebody's working on this.

14:51.516 --> 14:53.560
Be ready to hand-crank the bypass.

14:53.643 --> 14:56.605
You're keeping him under.
Can somebody get us some lights?

14:56.688 --> 14:58.982
We're stopped. How come we're stopped?

14:59.608 --> 15:00.984
NATALIE: I don't know.

15:06.156 --> 15:07.157
Hello?

15:08.658 --> 15:09.784
Is anyone out there?

15:10.910 --> 15:11.995
Hello!

15:16.499 --> 15:20.378
The whole hospital is gone.
Lights, computers, imaging, Pyxis.

15:20.462 --> 15:21.921
What happened to the backup generator?

15:22.005 --> 15:24.591
Totally flooded. It's gonna take a few
hours to get back on.

15:24.674 --> 15:26.843
All right. Automatic locks'll be shut,
elevators jammed.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.887
We'll do a sweep to see if we can
find anyone in trouble.

15:28.970 --> 15:30.305
Thank you.

15:30.388 --> 15:32.349
-Mags, where are we going?
-MAGGIE: All bets are off.

15:32.432 --> 15:33.975
Take the Hybrid OR.

15:35.060 --> 15:37.646
Here. You take this one.

15:39.981 --> 15:41.983
ETHAN: Okay, let's get ready to transfer.

15:45.111 --> 15:46.321
-Everybody ready?
-Yeah.

15:46.404 --> 15:47.447
One, two, three.

15:48.657 --> 15:51.076
Mo, change to a pressure bag
and then send for four more units.

15:52.077 --> 15:53.286
You think he's still losing blood?

15:53.870 --> 15:54.954
Gonna find out now.

15:55.038 --> 15:56.623
You ever checked abdominal pressure
with a Foley?

15:56.706 --> 15:57.874
I've read about it.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.709
It's old school.
Just put a catheter on the bag,

15:59.793 --> 16:01.670
then add a transducer
with a three-way tap.

16:01.753 --> 16:03.129
-Okay.
-NURSE: Dr. Choi,

16:03.213 --> 16:04.381
April, they need you in three.

16:04.464 --> 16:08.176
Okay. Hook it up to the A-line transducer,
then watch the waveform.

16:08.259 --> 16:10.637
-If it gets above 30, come and get me.
-Okay.

16:11.221 --> 16:13.306
-Let me help you with that.
-April.

16:13.390 --> 16:15.558
I think they need all the help
they can get out here.

16:16.893 --> 16:18.144
Steve, you good?

16:18.228 --> 16:20.105
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

16:23.775 --> 16:24.818
(SIGHS)

16:26.569 --> 16:28.238
Now, see the water's coming
in here from the edge.

16:28.321 --> 16:31.991
So, the backup generator is
located below a storm drain.

16:32.075 --> 16:34.160
-Are you serious?
-Don't ask me.

16:34.244 --> 16:37.747
Don't ask you? Look, you've gotta get
this thing up and running.

16:37.831 --> 16:39.457
Get as many men as you need.

16:39.541 --> 16:41.042
Yeah, it's still gonna take all day.

16:41.126 --> 16:44.003
Northern Illinois Power will get a spare
out to us before then.

16:44.087 --> 16:47.549
Oh, this is ridiculous. What is their ETA?

16:47.632 --> 16:50.969
Two hours? We'll have to send
our critical care patients out.

16:51.052 --> 16:53.972
We can't. Lakeshore Memorial's
already on bypass,

16:54.055 --> 16:56.725
East Mercy's taking all the overflow.

16:56.808 --> 16:59.394
So we have to keep
a thousand sick and dying patients alive

16:59.477 --> 17:01.354
with no lights, no medicine, no nothing?

17:01.438 --> 17:02.731
Well, we'll do the best we can.

17:02.814 --> 17:05.608
And, Maggie, pace yourself.
Today's gonna be a marathon.

17:10.363 --> 17:12.907
Stop cardioplegia,
and prepare to come off bypass.

17:18.455 --> 17:20.665
Okay, removing cross clamp.

17:28.256 --> 17:30.633
He's not getting enough flow
to his left anterior wall.

17:30.717 --> 17:32.802
-Can you up his output?
-Not enough to matter.

17:37.056 --> 17:38.475
Then we have to continue surgery.

17:39.058 --> 17:42.103
We can't arrest him again.
He'll never come off the bypass.

17:45.106 --> 17:47.734
Fine. Then we'll do it off-pump.

17:48.818 --> 17:51.946
But you can't sew a vessel
into a beating heart.

17:52.030 --> 17:54.073
That's almost impossible,
even with electricity.

17:54.157 --> 17:56.576
Graft is down.
We don't have a choice.

17:58.495 --> 18:02.290
But, a bad anastomosis and he'll clot off.

18:02.874 --> 18:04.209
It'll kill him.

18:04.292 --> 18:06.753
Well then, we'll just
have to do a good one.

18:07.587 --> 18:10.256
Speaking of which,
do me a favor and scrub in.

18:10.340 --> 18:12.175
I could use the extra hands.

18:15.512 --> 18:18.848
Man, I know it's hot in here,
but I'm kinda freezing.

18:34.989 --> 18:37.367
Here. Hang on. Someone's coming, okay?

18:39.828 --> 18:41.996
Natalie, what do we got?

18:42.080 --> 18:44.374
He's losing blood.
We need to get him to surgery.

18:44.958 --> 18:48.086
All right. Sit him up,
I'll get a sked down to bring him out.

18:50.713 --> 18:53.049
That... That doesn't feel so good...

18:54.509 --> 18:55.802
What's wrong?

18:55.885 --> 18:57.595
He can't maintain pressure sitting up.

18:57.679 --> 18:59.264
Can he stay up long enough
to pull him out?

18:59.848 --> 19:03.142
Taylor? Taylor.
No. It's not gonna happen.

19:03.226 --> 19:05.144
Get me four units of uncrossmatched blood.

19:05.228 --> 19:07.063
I need to stabilize him before I...

(GROANS)

19:08.273 --> 19:09.732
Hey, you okay?

19:10.900 --> 19:12.443
Yeah, Matt, I'm fine.

19:16.990 --> 19:19.659

You blacked out for a minute.

19:19.742 --> 19:21.536
But we're gonna get you some blood, okay?

19:22.036 --> 19:24.414
All right. I'm gonna get that
blood to you as soon as I can.

19:24.497 --> 19:25.623
Thank you.

19:26.708 --> 19:27.917
Just hang in there, okay?

19:38.511 --> 19:40.722
Why is this happening?

19:40.805 --> 19:42.557
Finally, a doctor.

19:42.640 --> 19:44.058
Have you figured out what's going on?

19:44.142 --> 19:46.352
No. The lab went down
before they could run Lacey's blood.

19:46.436 --> 19:48.897
-What kind of a hospital is this?
-LACEY: Mom...

19:49.689 --> 19:52.775
I apologize for the circumstances.
We're trying to remedy it.

19:52.859 --> 19:54.444
So, what do we do next?

19:55.028 --> 19:56.696
Unfortunately, we can't do much.

19:56.779 --> 19:59.073
I've called Neurology,
but it is gonna be a long wait.

19:59.157 --> 20:02.911
But it's just a gas leak. Please.
Just give me some medicine or something.

20:02.994 --> 20:04.996
Treatment for inhalation is supportive.

20:05.079 --> 20:06.873
The symptoms,
they have to wear off over time.

20:06.956 --> 20:09.542
She doesn't have time.
She needs to get to soccer practice.

20:09.626 --> 20:11.377
Yeah. The finals are tomorrow.

20:11.961 --> 20:13.838
Yeah, I gotta be honest,
given what I'm seeing,

20:13.922 --> 20:15.840
I'm not optimistic
about you playing in that game.

20:15.924 --> 20:17.383
What?

20:17.467 --> 20:19.218
You can't do that!
It's the state finals!

20:19.302 --> 20:21.554
Dr. Halstead, I have to play.

20:21.638 --> 20:25.183

and I have been working so hard.

20:25.266 --> 20:27.268
I can't let them down now. I can't.
(SOBS)

20:28.686 --> 20:30.188
You need to figure this out.

20:30.271 --> 20:32.357
I hear ya.
And we are doing our best.

20:33.483 --> 20:37.028
Just try to take it easy,
relax, and let us take care of you.

20:38.488 --> 20:40.406
I'm gonna find out
what's going on with the power,

20:40.490 --> 20:42.241
and hopefully we'll have
some answers soon.

And what's this for?

21:16.067 --> 21:17.902
Abdominal compartment syndrome.

21:18.486 --> 21:19.737
Wait you think that's all blood in there?

21:19.821 --> 21:21.364
Pelvic hematoma must've ruptured.

21:21.447 --> 21:24.409
The pressure's so high, he's not getting
any blood back to his heart.

21:24.492 --> 21:27.745
But if we can't get him upstairs to the OR
how are we gonna take care of him?

21:29.539 --> 21:31.624
Oh, my God.

21:34.752 --> 21:36.045
All right.

21:36.796 --> 21:37.922
Let's bag him.

21:42.343 --> 21:45.722
Hey. Hey, Steve. Look at me.

21:45.805 --> 21:47.974

You saved his life.

Good question. The fire department
just told me the school is clean. So...

22:53.498 --> 22:57.085
So, you weren't experiencing
any symptoms at all? No warning?

22:57.168 --> 22:59.629
-It just came up out of nowhere?
-Yeah.

22:59.712 --> 23:00.713

23:02.131 --> 23:06.552
Calculus, wow. I'm very impressed that
you can concentrate on that right now.

23:06.636 --> 23:08.387
AP test is in a week.
I don't have a choice.

23:08.471 --> 23:11.057
I'm sure that we can arrange
for a medical extension,

23:11.140 --> 23:12.266
under the circumstances.

23:12.350 --> 23:14.519
People with medical extensions
don't get into Princeton.

23:16.479 --> 23:17.897

23:17.980 --> 23:20.900
Okay. Wait a second,
let me get you something. Here you go.

23:20.983 --> 23:25.071
Yeah. Okay. Okay. You're fine.

23:27.949 --> 23:29.200
I'll check back.

23:29.283 --> 23:31.786
Yeah. There you go.

23:32.954 --> 23:34.664
I'll be right back, okay?

23:38.042 --> 23:40.169
I mean, we don't have a choice,
we need to put them in isolation.

23:40.253 --> 23:44.257
Yeah. But you don't know what it is.
Could be environmental, or drugs...

23:44.340 --> 23:46.551
Her symptoms came on awfully quickly,
didn't they?

23:46.634 --> 23:49.011
As of right now,
infection's top of the list.

23:49.095 --> 23:51.639
All right then.
Start the isolation protocol.

23:51.722 --> 23:52.849
Okay.

23:54.517 --> 23:58.938
Maggie, I want you to put
another nurse on this case.

24:02.942 --> 24:05.403
You had a lumpectomy
for breast cancer two weeks ago,

24:05.486 --> 24:07.113
and now you're on chemo.

24:07.196 --> 24:11.450
You're immunocompromised,
and we don't know what these girls have.

24:11.534 --> 24:14.412
I'm going to be careful. Don't worry.

All right. We need an
intra-aortic balloon pump.

24:36.142 --> 24:38.394
It's the only way to hold his pressure
while we sew on the graft.

if it's in the right place...

Nah... I don't know. I think so.

24:58.331 --> 25:01.792
Yeah?
Okay. Turn on the pump.

Oh.

25:40.206 --> 25:41.332
Is he gonna be okay?

25:42.625 --> 25:43.834
Did he have a stroke?

25:43.918 --> 25:45.461
We'll find out when he wakes up.

-Yeah.

Are you feeling okay?

26:04.855 --> 26:06.399
Yeah. It's for that med student, Steve.

He hasn't stopped for a minute all day.
I'm just a little worried about him.

26:16.784 --> 26:17.994
How's he doing?

I'm trying to warm the blood up for him,
but his temp's down to 96,

26:21.455 --> 26:23.791
and if he gets any more hypothermic
it's just gonna make him bleed even more.

26:23.874 --> 26:26.127
-So I, you know, I've really...
-Well, he's stable right now.

26:26.210 --> 26:27.753

-Yeah.
-Yeah, it's not always like that.

about all the earaches and runny noses.

willing to risk a massive outbreak?

27:27.980 --> 27:30.441

are under a phenomenal amount of stress,

should address your symptoms.

Is it another antibiotic?

Well actually, it's not.

But Dr. Halstead
said this was an infection.

And it must be affecting

36:29.271 --> 36:31.440
to avoid dealing with emotions
we don't wanna confront.

36:40.824 --> 36:44.036
Hey, either way, Dr. Halstead,
you did the right thing today.

36:49.207 --> 36:51.001
Wait. How... How's Maggie?

36:51.585 --> 36:54.463
She says she's fine.
Thinks it must have just been the heat.

36:54.546 --> 36:56.381
Good. All right.
Let's get her out of isolation.

36:56.465 --> 36:57.466
Okay.

37:07.643 --> 37:08.810
-Natalie?
-Yeah.

37:11.021 --> 37:15.609
That night, it didn't feel like you were
coming to tell me you were engaged.

37:16.193 --> 37:17.444
What?

37:17.527 --> 37:21.448
In my car. I think you were coming
to tell me something else.

37:22.741 --> 37:26.912
I'm sorry, Will, I'm just...
I've had a really long day.

37:26.995 --> 37:30.374
Cool. Of course. I'm sorry.

37:30.457 --> 37:31.500
Goodnight.

37:35.671 --> 37:36.797
Wait.

37:39.091 --> 37:40.717
I just have to ask.

37:41.510 --> 37:42.719
Do you love him?

37:44.221 --> 37:46.890
Phillip. Are you sure?

37:47.557 --> 37:49.267
Am I sure that I love him?

37:50.185 --> 37:51.353
Just tell me.

37:52.312 --> 37:53.647
Do you?

37:54.940 --> 37:56.775
You know what?
My relationship with Phillip

37:56.858 --> 37:59.194
is the only thing in my life
that's working right now.

38:05.742 --> 38:09.121
Hey, guys.
Hey, you!

38:24.052 --> 38:25.053
-Dr. Marcel.
-Yeah.

38:26.763 --> 38:29.141
I am really sorry
about screwing up the pump.

38:30.392 --> 38:31.935
I could've killed him.

38:33.437 --> 38:34.438
Are you kidding?

38:35.564 --> 38:38.984
We were doing surgery on a beating heart
with no electricity.

38:39.735 --> 38:42.070
As far as I can tell,
you got a great set of hands.

38:42.696 --> 38:45.240
I'm sure they'll come of use
in your urgent cares.

38:47.451 --> 38:48.994
The right specialty,

38:50.871 --> 38:54.374
a surgeon can still make
good money, right?

38:54.958 --> 38:57.794
Yeah. Ortho, CT, Neuro...

38:58.879 --> 39:00.005
And with the right team...

39:00.672 --> 39:01.673
Oof!

39:14.770 --> 39:17.814
Hey, good day today.
I'll see you tomorrow.

39:18.565 --> 39:20.233
No, I'm not coming back.

39:21.651 --> 39:22.652
What do you mean?

39:23.236 --> 39:26.281
I love medicine. But what we did today,

39:26.364 --> 39:29.910
I can't do that every day
for the rest of my life.

39:29.993 --> 39:31.369
Hey, come on. It was a crazy day...

39:31.453 --> 39:32.871
I know, I just...

39:36.291 --> 39:37.501
I just can't.

39:47.677 --> 39:48.970
Was I too hard on him?

39:49.054 --> 39:51.264
No, not too hard on him.

39:51.348 --> 39:54.810
Just focused on getting
our patients what they needed.

39:55.894 --> 39:57.604
So I missed seeing what he needed.

39:58.522 --> 40:00.690
Babe, you are such a good doctor.

40:02.109 --> 40:06.279
Sometimes we get so caught up
taking care of everyone else,

40:06.363 --> 40:08.490
we forget to take care of each other.

40:09.074 --> 40:10.242
No.

40:11.660 --> 40:12.911
You don't.

40:14.371 --> 40:15.664
You don't forget.

40:18.834 --> 40:21.419
You're always so mindful
of everyone. So...

40:21.920 --> 40:23.588
Aware, so caring.

40:26.133 --> 40:28.343
I know we said someday, but...

40:30.929 --> 40:32.973
You'd make the best mom ever.

40:34.266 --> 40:36.685
-I love you.
-I love you.

40:56.121 --> 40:59.958
