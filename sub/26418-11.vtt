00:01.088 --> 00:03.090
Previously on Van Helsing...

00:04.395 --> 00:06.049
Yeah, we're okay.

00:06.093 --> 00:07.877
I had his sister, too.

00:07.920 --> 00:10.184
Dropped her off at the park,
at the swings.

00:10.227 --> 00:11.620
Never saw her again.

00:11.663 --> 00:14.057
You sure about this?
Going it alone out there?

00:14.101 --> 00:15.624
Yeah, I'm positive.

00:15.667 --> 00:19.715
Kill the one
you love.

00:19.758 --> 00:22.761
No matter what happens, meet me
in that place we talked about.

00:22.805 --> 00:23.980
Promise me?

00:24.024 --> 00:27.723
That is not
the one you love.

00:27.766 --> 00:29.812
No!

00:29.855 --> 00:31.248
Where's Felix?

00:31.292 --> 00:32.641

a bit.

03:38.218 --> 03:40.611
Come on now, ugh.

04:18.693 --> 04:20.651
Jesus Christ.

04:20.695 --> 04:23.350
Look at us, man.

04:23.393 --> 04:25.265
Hope you made it, Lorne.

05:01.301 --> 05:04.347
Come on, baby.

05:04.391 --> 05:06.828
Can't miss that.

06:49.626 --> 06:50.932
Axel.

09:02.237 --> 09:03.804
Oh, shit.

09:31.483 --> 09:33.050
...Come on!

09:33.094 --> 09:34.661
Run, run, run!

09:34.704 --> 09:36.793
You gotta be kidding me?

10:13.134 --> 10:14.701
Come on!

10:14.744 --> 10:16.137
Let's go!

10:17.921 --> 10:19.706
Hurry up!

10:21.533 --> 10:22.883
Shit!

10:26.713 --> 10:27.714
Oh my god!

10:28.802 --> 10:29.803

11:08.319 --> 11:09.799
Mohamad.

11:12.149 --> 11:15.022
Mo-haaaaamaaaad!

11:26.163 --> 11:27.077
Mohamad?

11:35.216 --> 11:39.263
Mohamad, where are you?

11:41.222 --> 11:42.571
Mohamad?

11:44.007 --> 11:45.400
Mohamad?

11:51.101 --> 11:53.060
Mohaaamad!

12:03.723 --> 12:06.290
Mohamad.

12:22.872 --> 12:24.178
Mohamad.

12:24.221 --> 12:28.748
Mohaaaamad!

12:45.982 --> 12:47.723
Drop it, soldier.

12:47.767 --> 12:50.421
Uh, marine, actually.

12:50.465 --> 12:51.509
I didn't mean to barge in
on you guys,

12:51.553 --> 12:52.989
I can just walk back
out that door.

12:53.033 --> 12:55.557
He saved our lives!

12:55.600 --> 12:57.733
All but Sandra.

12:57.777 --> 13:01.432
But I put the blame for her
on you, Lorne.

13:01.476 --> 13:03.695
Me?

13:03.739 --> 13:05.132
The plan was so clear.

13:05.175 --> 13:07.177
I went over it a thousand times
with you.

13:07.221 --> 13:08.352
I can just go.

13:08.396 --> 13:09.832
He helped us out.

13:09.876 --> 13:11.834
Give him dinner.

13:11.878 --> 13:16.186
It's up to you.

13:16.230 --> 13:18.319
I vote he stays.

13:29.591 --> 13:30.635
Is that a yes?

13:30.679 --> 13:32.028
Yeah.

13:33.247 --> 13:34.944
Why don't you go rest?

13:34.988 --> 13:36.641
I got this.

13:42.430 --> 13:43.300
Don't mind her.

13:43.344 --> 13:44.911
She's got some issues.

13:44.954 --> 13:46.042
Well, don't we all.

13:46.086 --> 13:48.044
So what's your story?

13:48.088 --> 13:50.438
It's not really one
worth telling.

13:50.481 --> 13:52.832
Why don't you let me be
the judge of that?

14:04.278 --> 14:05.018
Hey.

14:05.061 --> 14:08.108
Hey.

14:08.151 --> 14:10.458
Name's Lorne.

14:10.501 --> 14:12.199
You look familiar.

14:12.242 --> 14:14.549
You from around here?

14:14.592 --> 14:15.811
It's Axel.

14:18.248 --> 14:19.946
Axel Miller.

14:19.989 --> 14:24.472
I used to work for you down
at the old feed store.

14:24.515 --> 14:27.257
It can't be!

14:27.301 --> 14:31.174
Axel? Axel Miller?

14:31.218 --> 14:31.914
Look at...

14:32.915 --> 14:33.698
You sure you remember me?

14:33.742 --> 14:34.743
It's been a lot of years.

14:34.786 --> 14:36.658
Ya kiddin me?

14:36.701 --> 14:39.139
Forget the hardest working boy
I ever hired?

14:39.182 --> 14:40.096
Bah.

14:40.140 --> 14:42.185
Hell of a bat, too.

14:42.229 --> 14:44.231
Number nine, right?

14:44.274 --> 14:45.841
Shortstop.

14:45.885 --> 14:47.843
Jesus Christ, you remembered
the...

14:47.887 --> 14:50.193
jersey number from
junior baseball?

14:50.237 --> 14:52.543
I sponsored the whole
damn thing.

14:52.587 --> 14:56.721
Remember the logo right
on the front of the uniform?

14:56.765 --> 14:59.115
That's why you got the job,
son.

14:59.159 --> 15:01.901
I figured if you could put out
that much work

15:01.944 --> 15:03.424
running those bases,

15:03.467 --> 15:06.514
that maybe you could put in
a good shift at the store.

15:07.950 --> 15:10.213
Turns out I was right.

15:10.257 --> 15:11.519
Axel!

15:14.391 --> 15:16.872
I remember your mom and dad.

15:19.048 --> 15:25.272
And your little sister, Polly.

15:25.315 --> 15:30.538
Pretty, pretty Polly.

15:34.890 --> 15:36.761
Glad to see you made it, Lorne.

15:45.031 --> 15:47.250
You look familiar.

15:49.949 --> 15:52.429
I'm Lorne.

15:52.473 --> 15:58.522
I used to run the old feed store
out on the highway.

15:58.566 --> 16:01.177
I didn't catch your name.

16:03.832 --> 16:07.270
It's Bob.

16:07.314 --> 16:09.055
The name's Bob.

16:09.098 --> 16:09.925
Bob.

16:09.969 --> 16:12.275
Yeah.

16:12.319 --> 16:19.239
Well, nice to meet ya,
Bob.

16:19.282 --> 16:20.980
Nice to meet you, Lorne.

16:21.023 --> 16:22.546
Uh, yeah.

16:26.898 --> 16:28.857
Whole town wasn't hit that hard
after the first wave.

16:28.900 --> 16:30.859
At least that's what Lorne
used to say.

16:30.902 --> 16:34.906
Before he, uh, you know.

16:36.691 --> 16:39.433
Anyway, ash cloud cleared
after a couple months.

16:39.476 --> 16:41.565
Real trouble was on the coast.

16:41.609 --> 16:42.958
Yeah, tell me about it.

16:43.002 --> 16:44.960
Well, everyone from here went
for higher ground.

16:45.004 --> 16:46.614
More sun.

16:48.094 --> 16:50.400
I've lived here all my life.

16:50.444 --> 16:53.273
No way I'm giving up now.

16:53.316 --> 16:57.277
I, uh, used to run
the old feed shop.

16:57.320 --> 16:59.061
Right there off the old highway.

17:00.845 --> 17:02.804
That right?

17:03.892 --> 17:06.242
Name's Nelson.

17:06.286 --> 17:07.243
I'm from San Diego.

17:07.287 --> 17:08.505
Good to meetcha.

17:08.549 --> 17:11.508
I was headed for Denver,
but I ended up here.

17:11.552 --> 17:12.683
Listen, these daywalkers,

17:12.727 --> 17:15.208
they're not like what
they used to be.

17:15.251 --> 17:16.644
You have to be more careful.

17:16.687 --> 17:19.777
A feral is a feral.

17:19.821 --> 17:22.867
I mean, so this pack
don't sunburn.

17:22.911 --> 17:24.434
It's a fluke.

17:24.478 --> 17:25.653
Yeah, but it's not.

17:27.742 --> 17:29.135
Listen, sonny.

17:29.178 --> 17:31.006
I've lived here all my life.

17:31.050 --> 17:33.487
So don't come in here
and tell me what I do

17:33.530 --> 17:34.140
and don't know about ferals.

17:34.183 --> 17:35.402
Hey.

17:35.445 --> 17:37.534
I've killed more ferals
than he's ever seen!

17:37.578 --> 17:40.494
Hey. It's our turn
at scrub duty.

17:45.151 --> 17:46.326
Again?

17:46.369 --> 17:48.197
It's Tuesday, isn't it?

17:49.155 --> 17:50.852
Uh...

17:53.855 --> 17:55.161
I'm no slacker.

17:55.204 --> 17:56.249
Never said you were.

17:56.292 --> 17:57.206
Need some help?

17:57.250 --> 17:59.034
It's all right.
It's all right.

18:03.169 --> 18:05.780
He gets upset if he's not
in charge.

18:05.823 --> 18:07.651
I know the feeling.

18:13.266 --> 18:15.964
It's nice to see a new face
around here.

18:20.751 --> 18:22.710
Anyway, um.

18:22.753 --> 18:24.233
Welcome.

18:25.016 --> 18:25.887
Cheers.

18:36.941 --> 18:38.465
What's her story?

18:38.508 --> 18:40.162
Carter?

18:40.206 --> 18:41.163
Yeah.

18:41.207 --> 18:42.643
She's got guts.

18:42.686 --> 18:46.386
Yeah, but social skills?

18:46.429 --> 18:47.822
Well, she did point a gun
at my head.

18:49.345 --> 18:52.740
Well, that's just her.

18:52.783 --> 18:55.351
Again, I'm not going to gossip.

18:55.395 --> 18:57.440
Small town, you know?

18:57.484 --> 19:01.357
I do.

19:01.401 --> 19:04.012
Besides, if you got something
to ask,

19:04.055 --> 19:06.928
maybe you should just
ask it yourself.

19:22.552 --> 19:24.685
Don't shoot.

19:24.728 --> 19:27.383
I had my chance.

19:27.427 --> 19:29.168
Sure did.

19:31.648 --> 19:32.954
Those ferals, they're, uh...

19:32.997 --> 19:35.348
They're different.

19:35.391 --> 19:37.567
Not just the sun.

19:37.611 --> 19:38.699
They plan.

19:38.742 --> 19:40.396
They communicate.

19:41.615 --> 19:43.834
We used to fish and hunt.

19:43.878 --> 19:46.054
The store was just like storage.

19:46.097 --> 19:48.230
Just wander over
when you had to.

19:49.536 --> 19:53.583
Stuck in here now.

19:53.627 --> 19:55.672
The woods can't be that bad.

19:55.716 --> 19:56.630
I made it through.

19:56.673 --> 20:00.329
Yeah, but... Lorne.

20:00.373 --> 20:02.331
He's kind of slipping, huh?

20:08.642 --> 20:13.516
So, whose idea was
the siren?

20:13.560 --> 20:16.084
Nelson.

20:16.127 --> 20:19.218
It worked yesterday.

20:19.261 --> 20:20.828
They're smarter than that.

20:20.871 --> 20:24.223
Smarter than Nelson.

20:24.266 --> 20:25.441
He's not all bad.

20:25.485 --> 20:27.835
Might be onto something.

20:27.878 --> 20:29.663
Take out the whole pack?

20:29.706 --> 20:31.752
Only til the next pack
wanders in.

20:31.795 --> 20:34.798
Well, it'd be long enough to get
the food back here.

20:36.235 --> 20:39.586
Just ate a couple days'
worth of my take.

20:39.629 --> 20:42.415
You sure?

20:42.458 --> 20:45.505
Guy like you,
girl like Kelly?

20:45.548 --> 20:47.898
Seems like a perfect fit
to me.

20:47.942 --> 20:50.336
Someone to ride out
the apocalypse with?

20:53.774 --> 20:55.689
Let's move in the morning.

20:57.256 --> 21:00.694
The hardware store still
by the firehall?

21:00.737 --> 21:02.913
Last time I checked.

21:21.105 --> 21:21.758
Hey.

21:21.802 --> 21:23.238
Hey.

21:24.326 --> 21:26.807
Out for a morning stroll?

21:26.850 --> 21:28.678
Uh, no, I was doing
a little scouting.

21:28.722 --> 21:30.680
Checking out your defences.

21:30.724 --> 21:33.683
A man who likes to be prepared.

21:33.727 --> 21:35.859
You were in the army?

21:35.903 --> 21:38.035
Marines.

21:38.079 --> 21:40.864
You ever kill anybody?

21:40.908 --> 21:42.431
Before the rising?

21:42.475 --> 21:45.434
I don't really talk about
that stuff.

21:45.478 --> 21:47.175
Well, we have a past we'd
rather leave that way,

21:47.218 --> 21:48.916
good or bad.

21:48.959 --> 21:51.353
I'm gonna help you guys out
with another supply run,

21:51.397 --> 21:52.746
take my share,

21:52.789 --> 21:54.400
then I'm gonna leave you all
the way I found you.

21:54.443 --> 21:56.532
Good to know.

21:56.576 --> 21:58.882
What's the rush?

21:58.926 --> 22:01.885
I mean maybe you'd like to grab
a box of protection

22:01.929 --> 22:04.192
when you make the run
at the store.

22:06.237 --> 22:08.675
Uhh....

22:08.718 --> 22:10.067
I don't think that's
a good idea.

22:10.111 --> 22:12.940
I'm kind of waiting
for somebody.

22:12.983 --> 22:18.162
Oh. It's been six weeks.

22:18.206 --> 22:19.207
What?

22:19.250 --> 22:21.122
I had somebody too.

22:21.165 --> 22:22.819
Justin.

22:22.863 --> 22:25.300
He went to get firewood.

22:25.344 --> 22:28.216
That was six weeks ago,
so...

22:28.259 --> 22:30.523
Maybe you want to grab a box
of something, just...

22:30.566 --> 22:32.307
in case.

22:32.351 --> 22:35.179
Look, I'm sorry to hear about
your guy, you know,

22:35.223 --> 22:41.577
but... you really don't
have to do that.

22:41.621 --> 22:43.274
Do what?

22:43.318 --> 22:46.190
Trade yourself for a little bit
of safety.

22:48.323 --> 22:51.979
You don't know me.

22:52.022 --> 22:56.766
And more to the point, no one
here really knows you, either.

22:59.769 --> 23:00.988
I didn't mean to upset you.

23:01.858 --> 23:03.512
See?

23:03.556 --> 23:06.646
In the end, no one's really
who you think they are.

23:17.700 --> 23:19.789
Ready to go?

23:19.833 --> 23:21.530
Not until I know the plan.

23:21.574 --> 23:22.792
What do you mean?

23:22.836 --> 23:24.185
We sound the siren,
distract those things,

23:24.228 --> 23:25.447
grab as much shit
as we can carry,

23:25.491 --> 23:26.666
and run like hell.

23:26.709 --> 23:27.928
You can't just use
the same bullshit plan

23:27.971 --> 23:29.451
over and over again
and expect it to work.

23:29.495 --> 23:30.626
They're smarter than that.

23:30.670 --> 23:31.845
It does work.

23:31.888 --> 23:33.368
Really?

23:33.412 --> 23:36.806
You should tell that to the girl
who's dead outside.

23:36.850 --> 23:39.330
Well, if you think you've got
a better plan...

23:41.158 --> 23:42.682
I might.

24:08.708 --> 24:10.187
We got ripe berries.

24:10.231 --> 24:12.015
We got nice berries.

24:12.059 --> 24:14.235
We got berries for days.

24:14.278 --> 24:15.323
I like berries.

24:15.366 --> 24:17.281
I know you like berries!

24:17.325 --> 24:19.936
That's why we went
berry picking.

24:19.980 --> 24:21.242
Now...

24:27.596 --> 24:30.512
I have an idea.

24:30.556 --> 24:33.733
Why don't you take these
delicious berries

24:33.776 --> 24:35.648
back to Chad and the rest?

24:35.691 --> 24:36.823
Okay.

24:36.866 --> 24:38.955
Okay? Good.

24:41.567 --> 24:46.702
And I want you to tell them
that Grendel is back.

24:46.746 --> 24:48.356
He is?

24:48.399 --> 24:53.535
You walk back calmly to Chad,
and you tell them all to run.

24:53.579 --> 24:55.537
Understand?

24:56.495 --> 24:57.931
That was a great afternoon.

25:08.115 --> 25:09.899
Bye.

25:22.433 --> 25:23.609
Where's Felix?

25:23.652 --> 25:25.088
He was not worthy.

25:25.132 --> 25:26.568
Not worthy of you!

25:26.612 --> 25:29.223
You're nothing but a rotting
sack of shit.

25:29.266 --> 25:31.573
You love him, I can see.

25:31.617 --> 25:33.532
Really?

25:33.575 --> 25:35.229
I doubt that.

25:35.272 --> 25:41.191
I tried to love him.

25:41.235 --> 25:42.715
But I could not.

25:42.758 --> 25:44.847
You don't know what love is.

25:44.891 --> 25:46.849
You can't love anyone.

25:46.893 --> 25:49.330
I do know love!

25:49.373 --> 25:57.164
It is a cancer that I must
cut out of me.

25:57.207 --> 25:59.862
It is the source of
all the pain.

25:59.906 --> 26:02.038
Where's Felix?!!!

26:02.082 --> 26:03.300
Dead.

26:04.780 --> 26:07.087
There. See?

26:07.130 --> 26:08.654
Love.

26:08.697 --> 26:10.612
It's the greatest torturer.

26:15.138 --> 26:17.924
Don't you want to be
free of that?

26:17.967 --> 26:19.621
I'd rather die.

26:19.665 --> 26:24.060
Not your choice, really,
is it?

26:29.152 --> 26:35.942
If you shoot me again, I will
find that little Tabby

26:35.985 --> 26:39.772
and I will tear her apart
in front of you.

26:42.078 --> 26:43.253
No.

26:43.297 --> 26:45.299
There.

26:45.342 --> 26:47.780
Love again.

26:47.823 --> 26:55.439
Your worst enemy,
seeded deep inside of you.

26:56.876 --> 26:58.051
Stop.

26:58.094 --> 27:02.316
Shoot. Shoot.

27:04.623 --> 27:07.060
There. Love again.

27:10.324 --> 27:11.760
Our Father...

27:11.804 --> 27:16.112
You are pleading to a god
that tortures you?

27:16.156 --> 27:18.767
In heaven he gives us
our food.

27:18.811 --> 27:24.555
All this suffering
is because of this.

27:24.599 --> 27:25.818
This.

27:25.861 --> 27:28.821
I will forgive those
just as he forgives us.

27:28.864 --> 27:31.171
He will deliver us from evil.

27:31.214 --> 27:33.564
This is evil.

27:33.608 --> 27:37.046
Love is evil.

27:37.090 --> 27:39.701
You have no heart.

27:39.745 --> 27:41.616
Yes, I do.

27:41.660 --> 27:43.705
I do.

27:43.749 --> 27:46.316
And it torments me.

27:46.360 --> 27:49.624
But I will no longer allow that.

27:49.668 --> 27:51.626
I will cut it out.

27:52.932 --> 27:57.458
I will gorge it out.

28:05.031 --> 28:06.597
No love.

28:07.860 --> 28:08.904
No!!

28:08.948 --> 28:11.298
No! No!

28:14.649 --> 28:19.175
I didn't know love until
the world turned dark.

28:19.219 --> 28:26.313
And then that love
became the world itself.

28:26.356 --> 28:32.145
It took the place of everything
else I had lost.

28:34.103 --> 28:35.757
No.

28:35.801 --> 28:36.540
No...

28:36.584 --> 28:38.238
Yes!

28:41.981 --> 28:45.941
There. Love tortures again.

28:48.509 --> 28:50.598
Oh!

28:54.515 --> 28:58.084
And love you still do.

28:58.127 --> 29:00.216
But I fight it.

29:00.260 --> 29:04.612
You must extinguish the flame.

29:04.655 --> 29:07.310
But how?

29:07.354 --> 29:08.790
I've lost him.

29:08.834 --> 29:11.619
Mohamad?

29:11.662 --> 29:12.663
Yes.

29:14.796 --> 29:18.757
He is found with her.

29:18.800 --> 29:21.281
She returns to the crypt.

29:21.324 --> 29:22.891
The crypt.

29:23.239 --> 29:25.764
Follow his trail.

29:25.807 --> 29:28.810
You have not lost him.

29:28.854 --> 29:32.771
Follow and you will find
your destiny.

29:42.911 --> 29:44.478
I met six of these daywalkers.

29:44.521 --> 29:46.349
Two at the tree-line,

29:46.393 --> 29:47.873
the other four they're just
running up and down the road

29:47.916 --> 29:49.091
keeping watch.

29:49.135 --> 29:50.266
That's the whole pack.

29:50.310 --> 29:51.659
Looks like it.

29:51.702 --> 29:53.530
You really think we can take
them on all at once?

29:53.574 --> 29:55.271
Yeah, I don't see why not.

29:55.315 --> 29:56.664
As long as Kelly and Lorne

29:56.707 --> 29:58.318
pop the signal at the right
time and hang back.

29:58.361 --> 29:59.493
Hmm.

29:59.536 --> 30:01.321
You guys get everything
we need?

30:01.364 --> 30:03.627
If it can destroy a daywalker
and runs on gas.

30:05.586 --> 30:07.022
Let's do it.

30:11.200 --> 30:14.073
Where'd GI Joe say he was from,
again?

30:14.116 --> 30:15.857
He didn't. Why?

30:39.402 --> 30:40.795
Kelly's set.

30:40.839 --> 30:42.579
Nelson and Hugo are in place.

30:42.623 --> 30:43.929
All right. Stay sharp.

30:48.020 --> 30:50.718
If things go sideways,
make sure you fall back.

30:55.114 --> 30:56.202
That's our cue.

30:56.245 --> 30:58.595
One one thousand,
two one thousand.

31:09.041 --> 31:11.217
The last two aren't
falling for it.

31:11.260 --> 31:13.480
Let's give 'em something
to fall for.

31:15.743 --> 31:16.918
Hey assholes!

31:21.314 --> 31:22.184
Come to papa!

31:48.950 --> 31:50.996
Goddamn.

31:51.039 --> 31:53.085
I gotta get me one of these.

32:01.789 --> 32:03.747
Die, you piece of shit!!

32:08.143 --> 32:09.057
We put ours down.

32:09.101 --> 32:09.971
How bout y'all,
everybody good?

32:10.015 --> 32:11.190
Yeah. We're all right.

32:11.233 --> 32:12.060
Got our two.

32:12.104 --> 32:13.322
Where are the others at?

32:13.366 --> 32:15.759
There should be two more
out there somewhere.

32:19.154 --> 32:20.068
Hey!!!

32:22.070 --> 32:22.679
Lorne! Lorne!

32:22.723 --> 32:23.463
Stop shooting!

32:23.506 --> 32:24.029
What are you doing?

32:24.072 --> 32:24.681
Stop, stop!

32:24.725 --> 32:26.248
Lorne! Come back!

32:26.988 --> 32:28.120
Lorne! Stop firing!

32:28.163 --> 32:28.990
Stop, stop!

32:31.601 --> 32:32.951
Hugo, Nelson,
kill that thing!

32:35.344 --> 32:36.780
Come on!

32:47.487 --> 32:48.357
Help me.

32:49.184 --> 32:49.968
Please.

32:50.011 --> 32:51.056
Don't let me turn!

32:51.099 --> 32:52.796
Don't let me turn!

32:52.840 --> 32:53.536
I'm sorry, kid.

32:57.018 --> 32:58.498
Come on!!!

32:58.541 --> 33:00.239
Come on!

33:00.282 --> 33:03.285
Come now, come on!

33:03.329 --> 33:04.895
Come on!

33:08.247 --> 33:11.467
Come on, come on!

33:17.386 --> 33:21.347
Hey, you all right?

33:21.390 --> 33:22.739
Let's go. Let's get inside.

33:22.783 --> 33:24.306
Come on.

33:28.397 --> 33:29.703
Are you okay?

33:29.746 --> 33:30.356
I can help.

33:30.399 --> 33:32.575
Don't touch me.

33:32.619 --> 33:33.750
This is your fault.
All of it.

33:33.794 --> 33:34.969
You know that, right?

33:35.013 --> 33:36.101
What the hell happened
to her out there?

33:36.144 --> 33:37.058
She's done it a couple
of times before.

33:37.102 --> 33:38.103
Something just sets
her off.

33:38.146 --> 33:40.148
Dark spaces,
I don't know.

33:48.113 --> 33:49.201
How you doing? You okay?

33:49.244 --> 33:51.072
Yeah. I just got nicked,
that's all.

33:51.116 --> 33:52.943
Let me take a look.

33:53.857 --> 33:55.685
Hell of a plan.

33:55.729 --> 33:56.773
Kelly's dead.

33:56.817 --> 33:59.167
I should never have listened
to you.

33:59.211 --> 34:00.212
Look, I take the blame
for that.

34:00.255 --> 34:00.951
That's on me.

34:00.995 --> 34:03.128
She went sideways, I...

34:03.171 --> 34:05.782
What happened to you
out there?

34:08.437 --> 34:11.440
You know, I had a buddy
in Iraq who was a rock.

34:11.484 --> 34:12.876
Never faltered,
always had your back.

34:12.920 --> 34:15.270
Then an IED went off.

34:15.314 --> 34:16.184
He was never the same again.

34:16.228 --> 34:17.316
I don't care about your buddy.

34:17.359 --> 34:18.143
I'm just saying
it's not your fault.

34:18.186 --> 34:19.187
Enough!

34:20.058 --> 34:21.233
All right? I hate basements.

34:21.276 --> 34:23.148
That's it. That's all.
End of discussion.

34:24.105 --> 34:26.020
My dad used to say that.

35:04.711 --> 35:06.104
Your real name.

35:09.498 --> 35:11.587
It's Axel, right?

35:14.547 --> 35:19.117
What's... happening here?

35:19.160 --> 35:21.815
I was supposed to stay
by the swings.

35:28.604 --> 35:29.779
Polly?

35:29.823 --> 35:32.826
Don't use that name.
That's my old name.

35:36.308 --> 35:38.788
I came back.

35:38.832 --> 35:41.095
I looked for you.

35:42.836 --> 35:45.099
He was so kind.

35:45.143 --> 35:47.232
And I trusted him.

35:47.275 --> 35:49.843
I'm so sorry, I shouldn't
have gone.

35:49.886 --> 35:51.975
Don't... Don't say sorry,
don't say sorry!

35:52.019 --> 35:54.935
Jesus Christ.

35:54.978 --> 35:57.024
This was on me.

35:57.067 --> 35:58.808
I was supposed to be
watching you.

35:58.852 --> 36:00.810
I should have listened
to you.

36:00.854 --> 36:03.335
He said he needed help,
and then he got me,

36:03.378 --> 36:04.336
and I tried to get out,
but I couldn't...

36:04.379 --> 36:05.598
No, no, no.

36:05.641 --> 36:07.948
This was not your fault.

36:15.347 --> 36:18.567
Where were ya?

36:18.611 --> 36:22.615
We looked everywhere,
you know.

36:22.658 --> 36:23.877
Whole town.

36:23.920 --> 36:25.313
State police.

36:26.140 --> 36:32.538
In his house. In the basement.

36:32.581 --> 36:36.933
He let me upstairs after
a while when I was older.

36:36.977 --> 36:41.329
When all the...
other stuff was over.

36:45.551 --> 36:50.077
By then, he already wasn't
thinking straight anymore.

36:50.120 --> 36:54.821
Now he doesn't even remember
what he did.

36:54.864 --> 36:58.303
Or, who I am, really.

36:59.304 --> 37:00.522
His mind.

37:00.566 --> 37:01.958
It goes back to before.

37:02.002 --> 37:04.831
You know, when he ran
the feed store.

37:10.837 --> 37:13.709
Lorne did this to you?

37:13.753 --> 37:15.407
He doesn't know though.

37:15.450 --> 37:17.104
It's all gone.

37:19.280 --> 37:20.803
He's gonna pay for what he did.

37:20.847 --> 37:23.415
To me, or to you?

37:23.458 --> 37:25.721
I worked with him every day,

37:25.765 --> 37:27.288
the whole time,
he had you?

37:27.332 --> 37:29.334
I don't think about back then.

37:32.554 --> 37:33.381
Why didn't you kill him?

37:33.425 --> 37:36.036
'Cause he's all I had.

37:36.079 --> 37:38.778
He felt bad every day
about doing it.

37:38.821 --> 37:39.996
Who gives a shit how he feels?

37:40.040 --> 37:42.695
I do. Me.

37:42.738 --> 37:43.652
Why are you defending him?

37:43.696 --> 37:44.697
I have to.

37:44.740 --> 37:46.438
No, you don't!

37:46.481 --> 37:48.091
I had to forgive him.

37:48.135 --> 37:49.310
You don't!

37:49.354 --> 37:50.964
Years ago...

37:51.007 --> 37:55.403
I... I... I couldn't
keep hating.

37:55.447 --> 37:57.057
That was what the real
darkness was.

37:57.100 --> 37:59.146
The hate.

37:59.189 --> 38:01.496
Nobody can forgive what he did.

38:01.540 --> 38:06.022
The hate is what's in
that basement for me.

38:06.066 --> 38:07.937
The hate is what scares me.

38:11.550 --> 38:13.508
Oh, no!

38:13.552 --> 38:15.902
Let me look. Let me look
what happened?

38:15.945 --> 38:17.033
Oh, Jesus Christ.

38:17.077 --> 38:18.687
It's... pretty bad.

38:20.167 --> 38:22.735
Stay here.
It's gonna be okay.

38:24.302 --> 38:25.738
Polly. Don't.

38:25.781 --> 38:27.740
Axel...

38:27.783 --> 38:30.351
I'm so sorry.

38:30.395 --> 38:31.613
Axel, listen to me.

38:31.657 --> 38:32.353
I can't tell you...

38:32.397 --> 38:35.356
Listen to me.

38:35.400 --> 38:36.923
You're my brother.

38:36.966 --> 38:41.101
And nothing will ever
change that, right?

38:41.144 --> 38:43.625
Look, just...

38:43.669 --> 38:45.540
Just... just...

38:45.584 --> 38:48.543
Just f... f... fight the hate...

38:48.587 --> 38:50.197
Don't leave me now.
Come on.

38:54.549 --> 38:56.246
You're okay.

38:56.290 --> 39:01.208
I'm... I'm....

39:04.342 --> 39:06.344
Don't leave me.

39:07.823 --> 39:10.348
I'm not going anywhere.

39:14.177 --> 39:16.005
No.

39:20.662 --> 39:24.144
No. I'm sorry.

39:29.236 --> 39:31.456
I'm sorry.

40:21.375 --> 40:22.507
Where's Lorne?

40:22.550 --> 40:23.725
Son of a bitch must
have wandered off.

40:23.769 --> 40:24.552
We'll get him.

40:24.596 --> 40:26.380
No. I got him.

40:48.837 --> 40:49.534
What are you doing here?

40:49.577 --> 40:50.796
You don't remember me?

40:50.839 --> 40:53.189
You son of a bitch,
you don't remember me!

40:53.233 --> 40:56.541
You used to own the feed store
down the road, didn't you?

40:58.499 --> 40:59.195
You're crazy!

40:59.239 --> 41:00.501
How scared was she?

41:00.545 --> 41:01.415
What you're talking about!

41:01.459 --> 41:02.503
All those years you kept her!

41:04.287 --> 41:05.898
How scared was she!?

41:05.941 --> 41:08.117
You did things to her.

41:08.161 --> 41:09.815
You remember that,
you piece of shit!?

41:11.904 --> 41:13.079
Stand up!

41:13.122 --> 41:14.341
I don't know what
you're talking about.

41:14.384 --> 41:15.690
You remember it.

41:15.734 --> 41:18.824
And I tell you what,
It's going to die with you!

41:18.867 --> 41:20.347
Help me!

41:20.390 --> 41:22.610
Help me! Somebody!

41:22.654 --> 41:24.307
Help me!

41:24.351 --> 41:26.309
Help!

41:33.578 --> 41:36.668
Polly... Help me.
