00:02.085 --> 00:03.879
(crashing)

00:03.921 --> 00:05.798
Oh, for God's sake,

00:03.921 --> 00:05.798
what was that?!

00:17.017 --> 00:19.478
Wherever you are,

00:17.017 --> 00:19.478
whatever you've done,

00:19.520 --> 00:21.271
don't think I won't find you.

00:28.362 --> 00:31.573
♪ Life is unfair. ♪

00:36.119 --> 00:38.163
We're so glad Francis decided

00:36.119 --> 00:38.163
to come down for a visit.

00:38.205 --> 00:39.957
It's been so long

00:38.205 --> 00:39.957
since we've seen him.

00:39.999 --> 00:42.710
And you tagging along

00:39.999 --> 00:42.710
is an added bonus.

00:42.751 --> 00:45.086
Well, making you happy

00:42.751 --> 00:45.086
makes me happy.

00:45.128 --> 00:46.380
You know, I don't

00:45.128 --> 00:46.380
think that nursery

00:46.421 --> 00:48.089
would ever get done

00:46.421 --> 00:48.089
without Francis' help.

00:48.131 --> 00:49.925
Hal has this thing

00:48.131 --> 00:49.925
about heights.

00:49.967 --> 00:51.092
I can't reach it.

00:51.134 --> 00:52.720
Dad, you have to come up

00:51.134 --> 00:52.720
another rung.

00:52.761 --> 00:53.804
(Hal whimpering)

00:53.846 --> 00:55.723
My ears are popping!

00:57.140 --> 00:59.100
So my doctor said

00:57.140 --> 00:59.100
I only have to wear

00:59.142 --> 01:01.102
these special shoes

00:59.142 --> 01:01.102
for two more years.

01:01.144 --> 01:03.146
Then I'm down to

01:01.144 --> 01:03.146
nights and weekends.

01:03.188 --> 01:04.940
Great Scott!

01:03.188 --> 01:04.940
You got a letter

01:04.982 --> 01:05.941
from Martindale Academy!

01:05.983 --> 01:08.109
What's Martindale Academy?

01:08.151 --> 01:09.152
It's the greatest,

01:09.194 --> 01:11.112
most advanced private

01:09.194 --> 01:11.112
school in existence.

01:11.154 --> 01:12.531
Do you know how many

01:11.154 --> 01:12.531
millions they've spent

01:12.573 --> 01:14.157
to make sure you've

01:12.573 --> 01:14.157
never heard about it?

01:14.199 --> 01:15.993
It says I've been accepted.

01:16.035 --> 01:17.118
I didn't even apply.

01:17.160 --> 01:19.287
No one applies. They find you.

01:19.329 --> 01:20.288
This is

01:19.329 --> 01:20.288
unbelievable.

01:20.330 --> 01:22.207
Malcolm, you're going

01:20.330 --> 01:22.207
to the show.

01:22.249 --> 01:23.709
You're set for life!

01:23.751 --> 01:25.168
Wait, what am I thinking?

01:25.210 --> 01:27.128
You can't go.

01:25.210 --> 01:27.128
You're too poor.

01:27.170 --> 01:29.423
You're like the

01:27.170 --> 01:29.423
poorest guy I know.

01:29.464 --> 01:31.842
Oh, I'm such a jerk!

01:31.884 --> 01:33.510
Here I am, describing

01:31.884 --> 01:33.510
this nirvana

01:33.552 --> 01:35.178
you'll never be

01:33.552 --> 01:35.178
able to experience.

01:35.220 --> 01:37.431
Holding out this hope

01:35.220 --> 01:37.431
of power and success

01:37.472 --> 01:39.140
to a guy in

01:37.472 --> 01:39.140
a three-dollar shirt.

01:39.182 --> 01:41.226
I mean, look at this hovel!

01:41.268 --> 01:44.438
Lloyd, you have to stop talking.

01:44.479 --> 01:46.440
It's okay to cry, Malcolm.

01:46.481 --> 01:48.191
Tears are free.

01:49.902 --> 01:51.653
Okay, everybody.

01:51.695 --> 01:52.613
Just got back

01:51.695 --> 01:52.613
from the doctor

01:52.654 --> 01:54.197
and everything's fine,

01:54.239 --> 01:56.867
but baby's a little bit

01:54.239 --> 01:56.867
bigger than expected.

01:56.909 --> 01:58.744
HAL: So, instead of having

01:56.909 --> 01:58.744
the baby in two weeks

01:58.786 --> 02:00.161
like we thought, we're going

02:00.203 --> 02:01.956
to induce labor

02:00.203 --> 02:01.956
on Thursday.

02:01.997 --> 02:02.998
Thursday?!

02:03.040 --> 02:03.958
This Thursday?!

02:03.999 --> 02:05.084
You can't do that!

02:05.125 --> 02:07.044
Oh, what difference

02:05.125 --> 02:07.044
does it make?

02:07.086 --> 02:09.546
It's just six days sooner

02:07.086 --> 02:09.546
that our lives are over.

02:09.588 --> 02:11.172
Hal.

02:11.214 --> 02:14.051
And... our new,

02:11.214 --> 02:14.051
more fulfilling lives begin.

02:14.093 --> 02:15.176
This stinks.

02:15.218 --> 02:16.344
LOIS:

02:15.218 --> 02:16.344
I know this is being

02:16.386 --> 02:17.554
sprung on you very suddenly,

02:17.596 --> 02:19.347
and you all have a right

02:17.596 --> 02:19.347
to be a little upset.

02:19.389 --> 02:21.182
A little?!

02:19.389 --> 02:21.182
Don't push it.

02:21.224 --> 02:23.018
Hal, you know what?

02:21.224 --> 02:23.018
I've got an idea.

02:23.060 --> 02:24.185
Why don't you

02:23.060 --> 02:24.185
take the boys

02:24.227 --> 02:25.771
out tomorrow and

02:24.227 --> 02:25.771
do something fun?

02:25.813 --> 02:27.230
I could use the time

02:25.813 --> 02:27.230
alone anyway

02:27.272 --> 02:29.691
to straighten up the house

02:27.272 --> 02:29.691
before the baby comes.

02:29.733 --> 02:30.818
I can help

02:29.733 --> 02:30.818
you clean.

02:30.859 --> 02:32.193
Well, that'll take

02:30.859 --> 02:32.193
a little longer,

02:32.235 --> 02:34.029
but I guess I could

02:32.235 --> 02:34.029
use the company.

02:34.071 --> 02:35.114
HAL:

02:34.071 --> 02:35.114
Hey, there's a car show

02:35.155 --> 02:36.364
at the convention center.

02:36.406 --> 02:37.699
Yeah, let's spend the whole day

02:37.741 --> 02:39.493
looking at cool things

02:37.741 --> 02:39.493
that we'll never get to own.

02:39.534 --> 02:42.037
Oh, come on, Malcolm, if we only

02:39.534 --> 02:42.037
looked at stuff we could afford,

02:42.079 --> 02:43.413
all we'd ever

02:42.079 --> 02:43.413
see is crap.

02:43.455 --> 02:44.623
HAL:

02:43.455 --> 02:44.623
Don't be a party pooper.

02:44.665 --> 02:46.166
It'll be great.

02:47.334 --> 02:49.628
MALCOLM:

02:47.334 --> 02:49.628
"Festival of Brides"?

02:49.670 --> 02:51.630
That's the lamest

02:49.670 --> 02:51.630
name for a car show

02:49.670 --> 02:51.630
I've ever heard.

02:51.672 --> 02:53.214
No, the car show

02:51.672 --> 02:53.214
was here last week.

02:53.256 --> 02:54.424
Let's get out of here.

02:54.466 --> 02:56.844
No. I just dropped 15 bucks

02:54.466 --> 02:56.844
on parking.

02:56.885 --> 02:59.054
We're going in.

02:59.096 --> 03:00.639
I know it's your fifth child,

03:00.681 --> 03:02.933
but still, you must be

03:00.681 --> 03:02.933
a little excited.

03:02.975 --> 03:05.060
Well, sure, every

03:02.975 --> 03:05.060
child is exciting.

03:05.102 --> 03:07.186
Not that you want to rush

03:05.102 --> 03:07.186
into something like that.

03:07.896 --> 03:08.939
Oh!

03:08.981 --> 03:10.315
Wow.

03:10.357 --> 03:11.608
You okay?

03:11.650 --> 03:13.861
The baby just started

03:11.650 --> 03:13.861
kicking like crazy.

03:13.902 --> 03:15.696
It's almost

03:13.902 --> 03:15.696
like something

03:13.902 --> 03:15.696
was upsetting...

03:18.073 --> 03:19.240
Mom!

03:19.282 --> 03:21.242
Are you going to open the door

03:21.284 --> 03:24.872
or should I lie down

03:21.284 --> 03:24.872
in the grass and feed the worms?

03:24.913 --> 03:26.247
Oh, great.

03:26.289 --> 03:27.916
Who opened the gates of hell?

03:27.958 --> 03:29.877
Mom? This is a surprise.

03:29.918 --> 03:31.879
What are you doing here?

03:31.920 --> 03:34.048
I'm moving in.

03:34.089 --> 03:35.841
What do you mean

03:34.089 --> 03:35.841
you're moving in?

03:35.883 --> 03:38.468
You are family, you

03:35.883 --> 03:38.468
will take care of me.

03:38.510 --> 03:39.887
This is ridiculous.

03:39.928 --> 03:40.888
You have a condo.

03:40.929 --> 03:41.972
It's nicer than this house.

03:42.014 --> 03:43.098
It burned down.

03:43.140 --> 03:45.266
Mother, you

03:43.140 --> 03:45.266
can't just...

03:45.308 --> 03:46.560
How did your house burn down?

03:46.601 --> 03:48.228
It was the villagers,

03:46.601 --> 03:48.228
wasn't it?

03:49.354 --> 03:51.356
It's a mystery.

03:51.398 --> 03:53.274
Why don't you go stay

03:51.398 --> 03:53.274
at Susan's?

03:53.316 --> 03:56.277
She has four extra bedrooms

03:53.316 --> 03:56.277
and a satellite dish.

03:56.319 --> 03:58.279
Your sister should stick

03:56.319 --> 03:58.279
her head in a can of beans!

03:58.321 --> 03:59.280
What?!

03:59.322 --> 04:00.657
She's always been your favorite.

04:00.699 --> 04:02.492
She's the only one you called

04:00.699 --> 04:02.492
when Dad died.

04:02.534 --> 04:04.161
She isn't my favorite anymore!

04:04.203 --> 04:06.163
She called me bitter!

04:06.205 --> 04:08.123
Then she hung up on me.

04:08.165 --> 04:09.290
On me!

04:09.332 --> 04:11.126
Or maybe I hung up on her.

04:11.168 --> 04:12.669
Who remembers?

04:12.711 --> 04:15.089
Either way,

04:12.711 --> 04:15.089
she should rot in hell.

04:15.130 --> 04:17.465
Mother, we can't afford

04:15.130 --> 04:17.465
to put you up here.

04:17.507 --> 04:19.134
You can afford a maid.

04:19.176 --> 04:20.719
I'm not the maid, Ida.

04:20.761 --> 04:21.887
My name is Piama.

05:12.562 --> 05:13.981
Don't worry

05:12.562 --> 05:13.981

get away with this?

05:42.425 --> 05:44.552
You are, aren't you?

05:44.594 --> 05:46.221
She's my mother.

05:46.263 --> 05:48.098
You know the way I am

05:46.263 --> 05:48.098
around her.

05:48.140 --> 05:49.390
Okay, if that's what you want.

06:05.364 --> 06:07.117
What is it?

06:09.328 --> 06:11.412
You are a horrible mother!

06:11.454 --> 06:13.414
You've always been

06:11.454 --> 06:13.414
a horrible mother!

06:13.456 --> 06:14.457
My whole childhood

06:14.499 --> 06:16.001
you'd bully me and ignore me

06:16.043 --> 06:17.044
and trivialize

06:16.043 --> 06:17.044
my feelings

06:17.085 --> 06:18.419
and do nothing

06:17.085 --> 06:18.419
but heap praise

06:18.461 --> 06:21.422
on my sister until I felt like

06:18.461 --> 06:21.422
I was worthless in comparison!

06:21.464 --> 06:23.008
Well, now she's worthless.

06:23.050 --> 06:25.135
I've got a right

06:23.050 --> 06:25.135
to change my mind.

06:25.177 --> 06:28.263
But just because your sister

06:25.177 --> 06:28.263
disgusts me more than you do

06:28.305 --> 06:31.016
doesn't give you the right

06:28.305 --> 06:31.016
to talk to me like this!

06:31.058 --> 06:35.062
I will talk to you any damn way

06:31.058 --> 06:35.062
I want, you hateful old woman!

06:35.103 --> 06:36.271
You are leaving!

06:36.313 --> 06:37.522
Wow! I don't know how

06:37.564 --> 06:40.525
I finally summoned the

06:37.564 --> 06:40.525
strength to do that,

06:40.567 --> 06:41.902
but it feels great!

06:41.943 --> 06:44.696
Now I'm not asking you,

06:41.943 --> 06:44.696
I'm telling you!

06:44.738 --> 06:46.907
Get out of my house!

06:46.948 --> 06:48.950
No.

06:50.493 --> 06:51.828
What?

06:51.870 --> 06:53.955
You heard me.

06:51.870 --> 06:53.955
I said "no."

06:53.997 --> 06:55.249
What do you mean, "no"?

06:55.290 --> 06:56.666
You don't have any choice.

06:56.708 --> 06:58.459
What are you going to do?

06:58.501 --> 07:00.337
Pick me up and throw me out?

07:00.379 --> 07:03.298
Are you going to toss an old

07:00.379 --> 07:03.298
woman out into the street?

07:03.340 --> 07:05.424
In front of your neighbors?

07:06.509 --> 07:07.761
Sounds good to me.

07:07.802 --> 07:09.263
Whoa!

07:07.802 --> 07:09.263
You brought this

07:07.802 --> 07:09.263
on yourself,

07:09.304 --> 07:10.764
you old monster.

07:10.805 --> 07:12.557
You have no idea

07:10.805 --> 07:12.557
how good this makes me...

07:12.599 --> 07:13.516

Attention, ladies and gentlemen.

07:32.827 --> 07:34.329
It's your "clucky" day.

07:34.371 --> 07:37.874
Chicken dance lessons are being

07:34.371 --> 07:37.874

07:40.543 --> 07:41.920
Excuse me.

07:41.962 --> 07:45.340
Can I talk to you

07:41.962 --> 07:45.340
for a second?

07:46.591 --> 07:48.802
Hey, can you get me a piece

07:46.591 --> 07:48.802
with a flower?

07:48.843 --> 07:50.804
I'm talking

07:48.843 --> 07:50.804
to an actual customer right now.

07:50.845 --> 07:51.972
I'm a customer.

07:52.013 --> 07:54.099
Yeah?

07:52.013 --> 07:54.099
Are you getting married?

07:54.141 --> 07:55.725
Why, does somebody like me?

07:55.767 --> 07:58.312
Hey, what are you,

07:55.767 --> 07:58.312
about five-seven?

07:55.767 --> 07:58.312
Yeah.

07:58.353 --> 07:59.520
Perfect. I own a tux shop.

07:59.562 --> 08:00.730
One of my models

07:59.562 --> 08:00.730
didn't show up.

08:00.772 --> 08:02.607
I'll give you 20 bucks

08:00.772 --> 08:02.607
if you walk around

08:02.649 --> 08:04.692
the floor in a tux

08:02.649 --> 08:04.692
and pass out my card.

08:02.649 --> 08:04.692
Buzz off.

08:04.734 --> 08:06.527
20 bucks?

08:04.734 --> 08:06.527
He'll do it.

08:06.569 --> 08:08.196
Need anybody in my size?

08:09.489 --> 08:10.531
It's very simple.

08:10.573 --> 08:13.534
You just walk up to somebody,

08:10.573 --> 08:13.534
get down on one knee,

08:13.576 --> 08:15.329
hand them one of my cards

08:13.576 --> 08:15.329

08:15.370 --> 08:18.539
"I propose that you get your

08:15.370 --> 08:18.539

09:21.311 --> 09:22.603
I want them out

09:21.311 --> 09:22.603
of my house.

09:22.645 --> 09:23.646
Wait a minute.

09:23.688 --> 09:24.814
No, this is my house!

09:24.856 --> 09:26.607
Folks, let's just slow down.

09:26.649 --> 09:28.985
I have the deed. It's in

09:26.649 --> 09:28.985
the safety deposit box

09:29.027 --> 09:30.611
at the Valley Federal Bank.

09:30.653 --> 09:33.448
Number 24866.

09:30.653 --> 09:33.448
You can check.

09:33.490 --> 09:35.616
No! I have the deed!

09:35.658 --> 09:36.826
It's, uh, yeah, uh...

09:36.868 --> 09:38.036
It's in a shoe box.

09:38.078 --> 09:39.454
It's under-under my bed...

09:39.496 --> 09:41.831
Well, I don't know where it is,

09:39.496 --> 09:41.831
but this is my house!

09:41.873 --> 09:43.875
You devious,

09:41.873 --> 09:43.875
ungrateful girl!

09:43.917 --> 09:45.626
She's done

09:43.917 --> 09:45.626
nothing but lie

09:45.668 --> 09:47.462
since the day

09:45.668 --> 09:47.462
I took her in.

09:47.504 --> 09:49.089
And her big boyfriend

09:49.130 --> 09:50.215
thinks he's

09:49.130 --> 09:50.215
so tough.

09:50.257 --> 09:53.510
How tough is it

09:50.257 --> 09:53.510
to hit an old woman.

09:53.552 --> 09:55.053
(sobbing)

09:55.095 --> 09:56.637
You... dirty old...!

09:56.679 --> 09:58.890
This is what she does.

09:58.932 --> 10:00.141
You have to stop her.

10:00.183 --> 10:01.351
You have to stop her!

10:02.685 --> 10:05.063
As I was saying,

10:02.685 --> 10:05.063
she is a very clever woman,

10:05.105 --> 10:06.856
and if you knew her as I do,

10:06.898 --> 10:09.443
you too would be suspicious

10:06.898 --> 10:09.443
of her story.

10:09.484 --> 10:11.152
And on Monday,

10:09.484 --> 10:11.152
when the bank opens,

10:11.194 --> 10:13.572
whoever actually has the deed

10:11.194 --> 10:13.572
can go get it.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.073
Then you apply

10:13.613 --> 10:15.073
for a court order

10:15.115 --> 10:17.075
and the whole thing

10:15.115 --> 10:17.075
should be straightened out

10:17.117 --> 10:18.159
in six to eight months.

10:19.702 --> 10:20.870
You can get

10:19.702 --> 10:20.870
up now, sir.

10:20.912 --> 10:22.330
(grunting)

10:23.290 --> 10:24.832
And if you hurt

10:23.290 --> 10:24.832
a single hair

10:24.874 --> 10:27.127
on that old lady's

10:24.874 --> 10:27.127
head, I'll be back.

10:27.168 --> 10:29.629
Off duty.

10:44.727 --> 10:46.146
Pass the rolls.

10:52.569 --> 10:54.695
You think that bothers me?

10:56.739 --> 11:00.201
Guess why your soup

10:56.739 --> 11:00.201
tasted different

11:00.243 --> 11:02.036
when you came back

11:00.243 --> 11:02.036
from bathroom.

11:03.746 --> 11:05.582
Ugh.

11:05.624 --> 11:07.334
There has to

11:05.624 --> 11:07.334
be some way to

11:05.624 --> 11:07.334
get rid of her.

11:07.375 --> 11:08.918
Well, we know

11:07.375 --> 11:08.918
she doesn't burn.

11:08.960 --> 11:10.711
Let's just face it.

11:08.960 --> 11:10.711
We're stuck with her.

11:10.753 --> 11:11.796
You can't give up.

11:11.838 --> 11:13.507
You can

11:11.838 --> 11:13.507
totally do this.

11:13.548 --> 11:15.216
I'm sorry.

11:13.548 --> 11:15.216
I just don't know what to do.

11:15.258 --> 11:17.010
She's too powerful.

11:17.051 --> 11:18.970
Every monster

11:17.051 --> 11:18.970
has its weakness.

11:19.012 --> 11:20.138
Frankenstein has fire.

11:20.180 --> 11:21.722
Dracula, the cross.

11:21.764 --> 11:24.683
There has to be something

11:21.764 --> 11:24.683
that Grandma's afraid of.

11:26.269 --> 11:29.356
So, what would you like me

11:26.269 --> 11:29.356
to do for you?

11:30.398 --> 11:31.566
Well, it's, uh...

11:31.608 --> 11:32.733
(laughs)

11:32.775 --> 11:33.818
It's kind of hard

11:32.775 --> 11:33.818
to say,

11:33.860 --> 11:35.654
Abe, um...

11:35.694 --> 11:37.238
It-it has to do

11:35.694 --> 11:37.238
with my mother.

11:37.280 --> 11:39.449
Oh, I know about mothers.

11:37.280 --> 11:39.449
Every time

11:39.491 --> 11:40.534
mine comes over

11:39.491 --> 11:40.534
to Sunday dinner,

11:40.575 --> 11:42.743
she always brings that pecan pie

11:42.785 --> 11:44.454
with real whipped cream.

11:44.496 --> 11:46.122
And she knows

11:44.496 --> 11:46.122
that's my one weakness.

11:46.164 --> 11:47.457
Our grandma's kind of like that.

11:47.499 --> 11:49.584
Except she's a wrinkled sack

11:47.499 --> 11:49.584
of hatred

11:49.626 --> 11:51.752
kept alive only by the will

11:49.626 --> 11:51.752
to destroy.

11:51.794 --> 11:53.921
We just want her

11:51.794 --> 11:53.921
out of the house,

11:53.963 --> 11:55.756
and she refuses to leave.

11:55.798 --> 11:58.759
(laughing):

11:55.798 --> 11:58.759
And I have this idea.

11:58.801 --> 12:00.053
You see,

12:00.094 --> 12:01.804
she's a horrible bigot.

12:01.846 --> 12:03.139
I mean, she's

12:03.181 --> 12:05.350
terrified of...

12:05.392 --> 12:06.601
black people.

12:06.643 --> 12:08.019
Oh.

12:08.061 --> 12:10.897
What do you want me to...?

12:12.023 --> 12:13.983
Oh. Oh-oh, I see.

12:14.025 --> 12:16.611
B-Because I'm...

12:16.653 --> 12:19.197
Well, you want me to...

12:19.239 --> 12:22.367
Well, I-I suppose I...

12:22.409 --> 12:24.369
Really?

12:24.411 --> 12:26.787
I'd do it, but I'm

12:24.411 --> 12:26.787
not dark enough.

12:26.829 --> 12:28.747
I just annoy her.

12:29.916 --> 12:34.087
(string quartet playing

12:29.916 --> 12:34.087
"Celebration")

12:36.089 --> 12:37.632
And then  I  said,

12:37.674 --> 12:41.302
"Orange you glad

12:37.674 --> 12:41.302
I didn't say 'banana'?"

12:41.344 --> 12:42.803
(laughter)

12:42.845 --> 12:44.055
Hey.

12:44.097 --> 12:46.057
I found these

12:44.097 --> 12:46.057
in the trash.

12:46.099 --> 12:47.475
Can we discuss this later?

12:47.517 --> 12:48.435
I'm with friends.

12:48.476 --> 12:49.185
Give me the tux.

12:49.227 --> 12:50.604
What?

12:50.645 --> 12:51.812
Thank you.

12:50.645 --> 12:51.812
No!

12:51.854 --> 12:54.107
I like this tux.

12:51.854 --> 12:54.107
It's mine.

12:54.148 --> 12:56.817
It's not yours. Now give it

12:54.148 --> 12:56.817
back, or I'll call security.

12:56.859 --> 12:58.737
Hey, I'm over there!

12:58.777 --> 12:59.820
Hey... you...

12:59.862 --> 13:01.030
Hey!

13:01.072 --> 13:02.323
Tell me which

13:01.072 --> 13:02.323
one you like.

13:02.365 --> 13:03.658
And be honest.

13:03.700 --> 13:04.825
Dad, I just want to know.

13:04.867 --> 13:06.827
Do you have any kind

13:04.867 --> 13:06.827
of financial plan at all?

13:06.869 --> 13:07.828
Any plan

13:06.869 --> 13:07.828
about anything?

13:07.870 --> 13:08.996
Malcolm, I'm telling

13:07.870 --> 13:08.996
you for the last time,

13:09.038 --> 13:10.498
stop worrying

13:09.038 --> 13:10.498
about money.

13:10.540 --> 13:12.250
Hey, I do your taxes.

13:10.540 --> 13:12.250
I know what you and Mom make.

13:12.292 --> 13:13.876
I know how much you're spending,

13:13.918 --> 13:16.003
and I have a pretty good idea

13:13.918 --> 13:16.003
what it costs to have a baby.

13:16.045 --> 13:18.005
You guys are going to

13:16.045 --> 13:18.005
be at least 70 bucks

13:18.047 --> 13:19.257
in the hole

13:18.047 --> 13:19.257
every month.

13:19.299 --> 13:21.008
By the time the baby

13:19.299 --> 13:21.008
starts school,

13:21.050 --> 13:22.843
you're going to be $18,000

13:21.050 --> 13:22.843
in debt,

13:22.885 --> 13:24.845
and that's where

13:22.885 --> 13:24.845
they'll cut you off.

13:24.887 --> 13:26.931
You're going to be bankrupt

13:24.887 --> 13:26.931
and ruined.

13:26.973 --> 13:28.099
Something will come up.

13:28.141 --> 13:29.225
You can't keep saying that.

13:29.267 --> 13:30.851
Fine. I'm a failure

13:29.267 --> 13:30.851
as a father.

13:30.893 --> 13:32.061
I'm a terrible provider.

13:32.103 --> 13:33.854
Is that what you want to hear?

13:33.896 --> 13:36.107
No.

13:36.149 --> 13:37.900
But I have a way to fix it.

13:37.942 --> 13:39.569
What's this?

13:39.611 --> 13:42.280
It's from the Martindale

13:39.611 --> 13:42.280
Academy.

13:43.114 --> 13:45.450
It's this amazing prep school...

13:45.492 --> 13:46.993
but it's in London.

13:48.369 --> 13:50.330
They're offering me

13:48.369 --> 13:50.330
a complete scholarship.

13:50.371 --> 13:52.332
Tuition, housing,

13:52.373 --> 13:53.750
everything.

13:54.751 --> 13:56.377
If I'm not home...

13:56.419 --> 13:58.546
you just might make it.

13:58.588 --> 14:00.590
I'm totally willing to do it.

14:02.925 --> 14:05.303
Absolutely not.

14:05.345 --> 14:07.347
You don't get to leave.

14:07.388 --> 14:09.098
But you...

14:07.388 --> 14:09.098
Malcolm, you're our only hope.

14:09.140 --> 14:10.891
Hold this.

14:09.140 --> 14:10.891
Sure.

14:10.933 --> 14:12.560
Now let me explain

14:10.933 --> 14:12.560
something to you.

14:12.602 --> 14:14.187
Whenever your mother or I say

14:14.228 --> 14:16.523
"Something will come up"

14:14.228 --> 14:16.523
or "Things will work out,"

14:16.564 --> 14:19.900
that is our code for "Malcolm

14:16.564 --> 14:19.900
will think of something."

14:19.942 --> 14:21.569
But...

14:19.942 --> 14:21.569
We need you.

14:21.611 --> 14:23.279
The family is only a family

14:23.321 --> 14:25.532
as long as we all

14:23.321 --> 14:25.532
stick together.

14:26.949 --> 14:28.868
Where's Dewey?

14:32.622 --> 14:33.998
(dramatic accordion music plays)

14:34.040 --> 14:36.626
ANNOUNCER:

14:34.040 --> 14:36.626
Ladies and gentlemen,

14:34.040 --> 14:36.626
if you'll please

14:36.668 --> 14:38.919
turn your attention

14:36.668 --> 14:38.919
to the man with the balloon,

14:38.961 --> 14:40.755
and listen to the following

14:40.797 --> 14:42.882
heart-wrenching story.

14:45.051 --> 14:47.637
Hello. My name is Dewey.

14:47.679 --> 14:51.766
And the man with the balloon

14:47.679 --> 14:51.766
is my father, Hal.

14:51.808 --> 14:52.767
Dewey?

14:52.809 --> 14:53.934
Where are you?

14:53.976 --> 14:54.935
See,

14:54.977 --> 14:56.937
I'm the youngest

14:54.977 --> 14:56.937
of four kids,

14:56.979 --> 14:59.816
and I always get

14:56.979 --> 14:59.816
the short end

14:56.979 --> 14:59.816
of everything.

14:59.858 --> 15:03.944
I've never had a hot shower

14:59.858 --> 15:03.944
or a bed to myself.

15:03.986 --> 15:05.946
I'm the third person

15:03.986 --> 15:05.946
to wear this underwear.

15:05.988 --> 15:08.949
And yet, I've

15:05.988 --> 15:08.949
never complained.

15:08.991 --> 15:10.951
Dewey, what is this about?!

15:10.993 --> 15:14.955
Even when my parents decided

15:10.993 --> 15:14.955
to have another baby.

15:14.997 --> 15:16.165
I was happy to share

15:16.207 --> 15:17.458
what little I have.

15:17.500 --> 15:20.961
And then they told me

15:17.500 --> 15:20.961
they're inducing labor.

15:21.003 --> 15:24.965
And they picked a really

15:21.003 --> 15:24.965
interesting day to do it.

15:25.007 --> 15:27.968
Do you remember what day

15:25.007 --> 15:27.968
you picked, Dad?

15:28.010 --> 15:29.053
Dewey!

15:29.095 --> 15:31.765
What day did you pick, Dad?

15:31.806 --> 15:32.973
It's Thursday.

15:33.015 --> 15:35.268
Just come down from...

15:33.015 --> 15:35.268
wherever you are.

15:35.309 --> 15:37.812
Of all the days

15:35.309 --> 15:37.812
you could have picked,

15:37.854 --> 15:39.814
you chose

15:37.854 --> 15:39.814
this Thursday.

15:39.856 --> 15:42.776
Anything interesting

15:39.856 --> 15:42.776
about Thursday, Dad?

15:42.817 --> 15:44.652
Will you stop this?

15:44.694 --> 15:46.362
Anything at all

15:44.694 --> 15:46.362
you can think of

15:46.404 --> 15:48.573
that might be happening

15:46.404 --> 15:48.573
this Thursday?

15:48.615 --> 15:51.992
Okay, Dewey, what is

15:48.615 --> 15:51.992
the big deal about Thursday?

15:52.034 --> 15:55.371
(echoing):

15:52.034 --> 15:55.371
It's my birthday.

15:55.413 --> 15:57.498
(gasping)

15:57.540 --> 15:59.500
It is not your...

15:59.542 --> 16:01.961
Oh, God!

16:03.129 --> 16:05.256
Well, ladies

16:03.129 --> 16:05.256
and gentleman...

16:05.298 --> 16:07.717
that's the story

16:05.298 --> 16:07.717
of the little boy

16:07.759 --> 16:09.719
who lost his birthday.

16:09.761 --> 16:12.012
If you have any thoughts

16:09.761 --> 16:12.012
or comments,

16:12.054 --> 16:14.014
my dad would love to hear them.

16:15.850 --> 16:17.017
This would be a good time

16:17.059 --> 16:19.520
for one of those ideas

16:17.059 --> 16:19.520
we were talking about.

16:19.562 --> 16:21.481
I've got nothing.

16:21.522 --> 16:23.399
LOIS:

16:21.522 --> 16:23.399
Thank you so much

16:21.522 --> 16:23.399
for coming over.

16:23.441 --> 16:25.485
I know this is

16:23.441 --> 16:25.485
a little weird.

16:25.526 --> 16:26.820
Actually, I'm kind of excited.

16:26.861 --> 16:28.279
This is kind of like

16:28.321 --> 16:30.865
when I did  Spoon River Anthology

16:28.321 --> 16:30.865
in college.

16:30.907 --> 16:33.493
Do we  have

16:30.907 --> 16:33.493
to hear that story again?

16:33.534 --> 16:35.995
We sold out both shows.

16:40.082 --> 16:42.084
Four pillows on one bed.

16:42.126 --> 16:45.296
This is why

16:42.126 --> 16:45.296
you can't feed your children.

16:45.338 --> 16:47.715
(choking gurgle)

16:48.800 --> 16:50.050
Oh, hi, Mom.

16:50.092 --> 16:52.052
I'd like you to meet

16:50.092 --> 16:52.052
some of our friends.

16:52.094 --> 16:54.221
This is Brian

16:52.094 --> 16:54.221
and this is Abe.

16:54.263 --> 16:56.432
Nice to meet you, ma'am.

16:56.474 --> 16:57.057
If you'll

16:57.099 --> 16:58.434
excuse me.

16:58.476 --> 17:00.060
I need to use...

17:00.102 --> 17:02.438
your toilet.

17:02.480 --> 17:03.439
I've been telling Abe

17:03.481 --> 17:05.024
all about you.

17:05.483 --> 17:07.527
Welcome...

17:07.568 --> 17:11.030
to da... hood... yo, yo.

17:12.782 --> 17:14.993
Gettin' all jiggly with it.

17:15.994 --> 17:19.079
Representin'.

17:19.121 --> 17:21.081
Uh... uh...

17:21.123 --> 17:23.083
Can't touch this.

17:23.125 --> 17:24.293
Abe?

17:23.125 --> 17:24.293
Huh?

17:24.335 --> 17:25.211
(quietly):

17:24.335 --> 17:25.211
Chill.

17:26.838 --> 17:27.338
Hello.

17:28.381 --> 17:30.550
Everybody decent?

17:30.591 --> 17:32.301
I used my spare key

17:30.591 --> 17:32.301
to get in.

17:32.343 --> 17:33.803
I hope you don't mind.

17:33.845 --> 17:35.095
That's why you have it.

17:35.137 --> 17:36.096
So you can come over

17:36.138 --> 17:37.682
anytime you want.

17:37.724 --> 17:39.475
Mom, these are our neighbors.

17:39.517 --> 17:41.101
Steve lives next door.

17:41.143 --> 17:42.102
Malik is on the other side.

17:42.144 --> 17:44.397
And Trey lives

17:42.144 --> 17:44.397
across the street.

17:44.438 --> 17:46.315
(laughs)

17:44.438 --> 17:46.315
Why, Lois, you make it sound

17:46.357 --> 17:50.486
like you're...

17:46.357 --> 17:50.486
surrounded.

17:50.528 --> 17:52.321
Allow me.

18:02.248 --> 18:03.958
Well, hello.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.502
And who is this fine lady?

18:06.544 --> 18:07.712
So what you doing

18:07.754 --> 18:09.088
later on?

18:09.797 --> 18:12.174
'Cause I like that wagon

18:12.216 --> 18:14.301
you draggin'.

18:14.343 --> 18:18.347
(screaming)

18:18.389 --> 18:22.602
(laughter)

18:23.770 --> 18:25.772
Mom, where are you going?

18:25.813 --> 18:27.857
I can't believe

18:25.813 --> 18:27.857
you live like this.

18:27.899 --> 18:29.859
I would rather sleep

18:27.899 --> 18:29.859
in a bus station

18:29.901 --> 18:31.151
or a Dumpster.

18:31.193 --> 18:32.361
Well, there's

18:31.193 --> 18:32.361
obviously

18:32.403 --> 18:34.822
nothing I can do

18:32.403 --> 18:34.822
to change your mind,

18:34.864 --> 18:36.156
but I'm heartbroken.

18:36.198 --> 18:38.325
You only just

18:36.198 --> 18:38.325
got here. I...

18:38.367 --> 18:40.160
What's wrong with you?

18:40.202 --> 18:42.747
Nothing.

18:42.789 --> 18:44.874
Everything is perfectly fine.

18:47.251 --> 18:49.087
Francis,

18:49.128 --> 18:50.379
you have to listen

18:49.128 --> 18:50.379
very carefully.

18:50.421 --> 18:51.881
God, I'm having a contraction.

18:51.923 --> 18:53.424
I'm going into labor.

18:51.923 --> 18:53.424
What?

18:53.466 --> 18:55.217
I have to get

18:53.466 --> 18:55.217
to the hospital,

18:55.259 --> 18:57.344
and you have got to get your

18:55.259 --> 18:57.344
grandmother out of here  now.

18:57.386 --> 18:59.179
(footsteps approaching)

18:59.221 --> 19:00.347
Come on, Ida.

18:59.221 --> 19:00.347
Let me help you.

19:00.389 --> 19:02.182
Don't you have

19:00.389 --> 19:02.182
rain dance to do?

19:02.224 --> 19:03.225
Bye, Mom.

19:03.267 --> 19:04.226
Great to see you.

19:04.268 --> 19:05.853
Have a safe trip.

19:05.895 --> 19:08.230
Don't forget to call us

19:05.895 --> 19:08.230
whenever you get to...

19:08.272 --> 19:10.190
wherever...

19:10.232 --> 19:11.233
(water splashing on floor)

19:11.275 --> 19:13.152
(all gasp)

19:15.947 --> 19:18.240
Maybe I'll stay

19:15.947 --> 19:18.240
few more minutes.

19:18.282 --> 19:20.952
(suitcases thud on floor)

19:27.249 --> 19:28.918
Well, Dewey,

19:27.249 --> 19:28.918
I hope you're happy.

19:28.960 --> 19:31.211
I thought I would be,

19:28.960 --> 19:31.211
but not  this  much.

19:31.253 --> 19:33.422
Let's find Reese

19:31.253 --> 19:33.422
and get out of here.

19:33.464 --> 19:35.466
Why is my cell

19:33.464 --> 19:35.466
phone off?

19:35.508 --> 19:38.719
68 messages?!

19:38.761 --> 19:40.054
ABE:

19:38.761 --> 19:40.054
The contraction started

19:40.096 --> 19:41.221
at 3:27.

19:41.263 --> 19:43.390
Oh, this one can tell time.

19:43.432 --> 19:45.392
(phone rings)

19:45.434 --> 19:46.644
Hello.

19:46.686 --> 19:48.604
Oh, hello, Hal.

19:48.646 --> 19:51.024
Oh, no, I'm fine.

19:51.065 --> 19:52.108
Now, honey,

19:52.150 --> 19:53.484
I don't want you

19:52.150 --> 19:53.484
to get too excited,

19:53.526 --> 19:55.153
but I think you should

19:53.526 --> 19:55.153
come home now,

19:55.194 --> 19:56.236
because, I'm... well, I'm...

19:56.278 --> 19:58.238
(laughs):

19:56.278 --> 19:58.238
I'm having the baby.

19:58.280 --> 19:59.323
What?!

19:59.365 --> 20:00.533
O... kay.

20:00.574 --> 20:01.868
Well, just... stay calm, too.

20:01.909 --> 20:04.244
Yeah, getting worked up

20:01.909 --> 20:04.244
will only accelerate things.

20:04.286 --> 20:05.245
Just relax.

20:05.287 --> 20:06.413
Do your breathing.

20:06.455 --> 20:07.665
(laughs)

20:07.707 --> 20:09.249
Where the hell

20:07.707 --> 20:09.249
is Reese?

20:07.707 --> 20:09.249
What's wrong?

20:09.291 --> 20:10.751
Your mom is having the baby now.

20:10.793 --> 20:13.212
See? Was that so hard?

20:14.296 --> 20:16.256
Now, Hal, I don't want you

20:14.296 --> 20:16.256
to panic.

20:16.298 --> 20:17.508
You drive safely.

20:17.550 --> 20:19.552
There's no reason to rush.

20:19.593 --> 20:22.180
Rush? Come on.

20:19.593 --> 20:22.180
You know me

20:19.593 --> 20:22.180
better than that.

20:22.221 --> 20:23.472
Find your brother!

20:23.514 --> 20:26.559
So, I'm just going

20:23.514 --> 20:26.559
to make myself some tea

20:26.600 --> 20:27.977
and relax until you get here.

20:28.019 --> 20:29.269
Good idea.

20:29.311 --> 20:31.271
You know, chamomile

20:29.311 --> 20:31.271
always relaxes me.

20:31.313 --> 20:33.273
Reese! Damn it,

20:31.313 --> 20:33.273
Reese, where are you?!

20:33.315 --> 20:34.942
I'm thinking

20:33.315 --> 20:34.942
of taking Sixth Street home.

20:34.984 --> 20:36.694
You want me to stop

20:34.984 --> 20:36.694
and pick up some ice cream?

20:36.736 --> 20:38.278
Reese!

20:36.736 --> 20:38.278
Where are you?

20:38.320 --> 20:41.323
(muffled):

20:38.320 --> 20:41.323
Over here.

20:38.320 --> 20:41.323
Reese?!

20:41.365 --> 20:43.117
I'm inside

20:41.365 --> 20:43.117
the giant violin case.

20:43.159 --> 20:44.368
Damn it!

20:43.159 --> 20:44.368
Get him out of there.

20:45.703 --> 20:47.287
So, is that a yes

20:45.703 --> 20:47.287
on the ice cream?

20:47.329 --> 20:48.288
No, I'm fine.

20:48.330 --> 20:50.290
Just come on home... carefully.

20:50.332 --> 20:52.210
Oh.

20:50.332 --> 20:52.210
Sure thing.

20:52.251 --> 20:53.711
Honey, can you hold on a second?

20:53.753 --> 20:54.879
Ow!

20:54.921 --> 20:56.089
(grunts)

20:56.130 --> 20:58.007
Hey, what are you doing?

20:58.049 --> 21:00.259
Boys, run!

21:02.344 --> 21:03.596
The boys send their love, too.

21:03.637 --> 21:05.014
Hey! Hey, you

21:03.637 --> 21:05.014
come back here!

21:05.056 --> 21:07.391
Your kid ran off

21:05.056 --> 21:07.391
with my $600 tuxedo!

21:07.433 --> 21:09.685
So, we're just pulling out

21:07.433 --> 21:09.685
of the garage right now.

21:09.727 --> 21:10.978
Got it on the oldies station.

21:11.020 --> 21:12.312
They're doing

21:11.020 --> 21:12.312
a Beatles "A" to "Z."

21:12.354 --> 21:14.398
Can you think of a Beatles song

21:12.354 --> 21:14.398
that starts with "Z"?

21:14.440 --> 21:15.482
'Cause, frankly, I can't.

21:15.524 --> 21:16.734
Hal...

21:16.776 --> 21:18.819
You sound funny.

21:16.776 --> 21:18.819
Is everything okay?

21:18.861 --> 21:20.571
Yeah, just turning onto Maple.

21:20.613 --> 21:21.906
(whimpers)

21:21.948 --> 21:24.117
Hey, the gas station

21:21.948 --> 21:24.117
by the church

21:24.158 --> 21:26.160
stopped selling diesel.

21:29.163 --> 21:30.998
REESE:

21:29.163 --> 21:30.998
Ow!

21:31.040 --> 21:32.291
Shotgun!

21:33.251 --> 21:34.794
(grunts)

21:34.835 --> 21:36.378
Wow, honey, you wouldn't believe

21:34.835 --> 21:36.378
the huge pothole

21:36.420 --> 21:38.214
we just went over.

21:38.256 --> 21:40.216
Let's go, Dad!

21:40.258 --> 21:42.176
Oh! I can't find the keys!

21:42.218 --> 21:43.594
Keys?

21:43.636 --> 21:45.429
Where the hell

21:43.636 --> 21:45.429
are the keys?!

21:45.471 --> 21:46.513
REESE:

21:45.471 --> 21:46.513
I got 'em.

21:46.555 --> 21:47.723
Now let's go!

21:47.765 --> 21:49.558
(gasps)

21:49.600 --> 21:50.935
Hal?

21:50.977 --> 21:52.853
Honey, can I call you back?
