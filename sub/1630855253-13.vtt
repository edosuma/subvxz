00:20.061 --> 00:21.479
[Angelina] <i>Previously on</i> Manifest...

00:21.479 --> 00:24.065
My ma died when I was a kid.
My old man split.

00:24.065 --> 00:26.317
Did you lie about being an orphan too?

00:26.317 --> 00:27.360
Ish.

00:27.360 --> 00:30.155
I love you.
I didn't cheat death to live a half-life.

00:30.155 --> 00:31.156
Neither did you.

00:31.156 --> 00:32.574
My guardian angel.

00:32.574 --> 00:35.702
So Angelina used the sapphire
to send you a fake Calling?

00:35.702 --> 00:37.620
With the one image
she knew I'd do anything for.

00:37.620 --> 00:40.498
So if she's got the sapphire,
what chance does the Lifeboat have?

00:40.498 --> 00:42.751
[Michaela]
<i>We have absolutely no idea where she is.</i>

00:42.751 --> 00:45.336
[Saanvi] Fiona Clarke started her career
in neuropsychology.

00:45.336 --> 00:47.130
Ended up being blackballed in her field

00:47.130 --> 00:49.883
for believing all of our brains
can sync up to one another.

00:49.883 --> 00:51.384
I've been waiting for you.

00:51.384 --> 00:52.385
[thunder claps]

00:52.385 --> 00:53.636
I'm not ready to die!

00:53.636 --> 00:55.472
Who said anything about dying?

00:56.097 --> 00:56.931
[gasps]

00:58.808 --> 01:00.602
[suspenseful music plays]

01:02.187 --> 01:03.104
You.

01:09.402 --> 01:10.945
- [Cal] Olive!
- [door opens]

01:16.159 --> 01:17.786
Cal, where have you been?

01:19.287 --> 01:20.538
Oh my God.

01:21.998 --> 01:23.124
Is that...

01:23.124 --> 01:24.334
Fiona Clarke.

01:24.834 --> 01:26.836
I found her hiding in a barn
by an apple orchard.

01:26.836 --> 01:28.463
A Calling led me right to her.

01:28.463 --> 01:29.839
[Olive] Is she alive?

01:29.839 --> 01:32.967
Yeah. She has a cut on her forehead,
but I don't see any other injuries.

01:32.967 --> 01:35.762
Oh my God, Cal.
She returned twice, just like you.

01:35.762 --> 01:37.555
I mean,
there has to be an important reason.

01:37.555 --> 01:39.224
Yeah, but what is it?

01:39.724 --> 01:41.601
I tried to ask her, but she is zoned out.

01:41.601 --> 01:43.770
It's like she's trapped in a Calling.

01:43.770 --> 01:45.438
Like Marco and the others.

01:52.362 --> 01:53.655
23B.

01:54.322 --> 01:57.117
All right, get the first aid kit.
Keep an eye on her.

01:57.951 --> 02:00.161
I gotta tell Dad.
Maybe he'll know what to do.

02:06.417 --> 02:08.545
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- [scanner beeps]

02:08.545 --> 02:10.839
How did you slip past me?

02:10.839 --> 02:11.923
Dad!

02:15.426 --> 02:19.639
[chuckles] Any day that begins with us
getting to see our daughters

02:19.639 --> 02:21.474
is a win for me.

02:22.100 --> 02:23.643
Couldn't agree more, Russ.

02:24.394 --> 02:26.563
- [Jessica] Hi, Dad.
- How you doin', sweetheart?

02:27.647 --> 02:30.066
Russell! You lied to me.

02:30.859 --> 02:34.821
You said your daughter was beautiful.
This woman's a world-class supermodel.

02:34.821 --> 02:36.781
Jessica, this is Eagan.

02:36.781 --> 02:39.492
He's teaching me how to lose at chess.

02:39.492 --> 02:42.245
True, but he only loses
because I'm spectacularly good.

02:42.245 --> 02:43.204
[Russ laughs]

02:43.204 --> 02:46.416
Lovely to meet you, Jessica.
Remember, we have a match this afternoon.

02:46.416 --> 02:48.459
- Winner takes all the lunch milk.
- Right.

02:52.755 --> 02:55.008
Just met
my new friend's daughter, Jessica.

02:55.008 --> 02:58.011
She's doing quite well
in the export business.

02:58.011 --> 03:01.306
She looks like she really loves her daddy.

03:01.306 --> 03:04.475
She'd do just about anything
for him, I'm sure.

03:06.477 --> 03:09.731
Have you been eating gluten again?
You look a bit bloated.

03:10.231 --> 03:14.319
Plexiglass adds ten pounds. At least
they know how to make a guy feel good.

03:14.903 --> 03:18.740
So sensitive lately.
Maybe I shouldn't visit you as much.

03:18.740 --> 03:22.035
We both know you love these visits
just as much as I do.

03:22.035 --> 03:25.121
Without them, you'd be broke... nhearted.

03:25.788 --> 03:26.831
[footsteps approaching]

03:26.831 --> 03:29.000
[suspenseful music plays]

03:30.460 --> 03:32.962
Excuse me. I have to use the ladies' room.

03:34.339 --> 03:35.423
[door buzzes]

03:36.841 --> 03:39.219
We weren't expecting her until the 23rd.

03:39.219 --> 03:41.221
We had three plans.

03:41.846 --> 03:43.765
We went with plan B.

03:43.765 --> 03:46.267
Just leave her on the couch

03:46.267 --> 03:48.853
until we figure out where to put her next.

03:50.271 --> 03:53.107
How is she? That was a long trip.

03:53.107 --> 03:55.860
She must have some interesting things
to say about it.

03:55.860 --> 03:57.737
Not really in a talking mood.

03:57.737 --> 04:01.032
She's just zoned out on the couch.

04:01.032 --> 04:01.991
[Ben] Interesting.

04:02.617 --> 04:05.370
Her travel buddy just landed in DC.

04:05.870 --> 04:09.707
I'd love to talk to him,
but he's not feeling that well himself.

04:10.875 --> 04:13.294
Are you trying him "daily?"

04:15.755 --> 04:18.466
Well, just keep your guest comfortable.

04:18.466 --> 04:22.762
If she starts to feel better,
ask her about her trip, why she came back.

04:24.931 --> 04:27.600
Meanwhile, I wouldn't bring her
for a visit.

04:27.600 --> 04:29.227
She might never leave.

04:30.770 --> 04:33.273
Place is infested
with grasshoppers anyway.

04:35.441 --> 04:36.734
That's not a grasshopper.

04:37.443 --> 04:40.905
That reminds me
of what grandma used to say

04:41.406 --> 04:42.824
when she got really mad.

04:44.158 --> 04:48.288
"May a plague of locusts fall upon you."

04:48.788 --> 04:49.622
Right.

04:50.748 --> 04:51.582
Grandma always--

04:51.582 --> 04:52.875
[high-pitch ringing]

04:55.044 --> 04:56.212
Hey! Wait!

04:56.212 --> 04:57.755
Hey, be careful!

04:57.755 --> 04:58.715
Please!

04:59.424 --> 05:00.675
Be careful with him!

05:02.635 --> 05:05.638
The entomologist identified them
as Rocky Mountain locusts.

05:05.638 --> 05:07.432
Extinct since 1902.

05:07.432 --> 05:09.517
Passengers seem to be buying
the infestation story.

05:09.517 --> 05:12.770
For now, but my guess is
things are going to escalate.

05:12.770 --> 05:15.773
We need to get a move
to Gupta's facility quickly and quietly.

05:15.773 --> 05:17.025
We'll use Agent Cordell.

05:17.025 --> 05:19.861
- Can he be trusted?
- He'll keep it need-to-know.

05:25.825 --> 05:27.076
A passenger have a Calling?

05:28.077 --> 05:28.953
Bring him in.

05:32.540 --> 05:34.125
Let me go. I can walk.

05:37.879 --> 05:39.630
This is Ben's Calling?

05:39.630 --> 05:42.050
He has just as much experience
solving them as I do.

05:42.050 --> 05:44.552
He could be a vital asset
if you put him out in the field.

05:44.552 --> 05:47.805
I'm sure every passenger
considers themselves a vital asset,

05:47.805 --> 05:51.267
yet this remains a detention center.
We operate by the numbers.

05:52.435 --> 05:53.311
Go ahead.

05:55.688 --> 05:56.522
[sighs]

05:57.190 --> 05:59.942
I was at Mansion Marina. End of the dock.

06:00.818 --> 06:03.905
<i>I saw a boat. Slip 57.</i>

06:05.073 --> 06:07.992
<i>And then something under the water
started to pull the boat over.</i>

06:09.535 --> 06:11.621
I mean, could it be about the Lifeboat?

06:11.621 --> 06:12.872
[sighs]

06:12.872 --> 06:15.166
Director Zimmer,
I had this Calling for a reason.

06:15.166 --> 06:17.877
- I should be the one--
- [Zimmer] By the numbers, Mr. Stone.

06:17.877 --> 06:21.297
That's how I operate.
Get him to the lab for monitoring.

06:22.924 --> 06:24.008
All right. All right.

06:27.011 --> 06:28.096
You two know the drill.

06:29.680 --> 06:30.681
[Michaela] Hey.

06:31.682 --> 06:32.934
This is your Calling. I...

06:33.559 --> 06:35.395
If I can't go, I'm glad it's you.

06:54.789 --> 06:56.457
Is she going to be okay?

06:58.918 --> 07:01.587
[sighs] Yeah, with our help, she will be.

07:02.130 --> 07:03.923
Why don't you go play a bit?

07:04.715 --> 07:07.051
You said we'd play makeup together.

07:07.051 --> 07:07.969
I promise we will.

07:07.969 --> 07:10.805
I have to hang out with our friend
for just a bit longer.

07:10.805 --> 07:12.682
And then I'll come find you, okay?

07:14.517 --> 07:15.393
Okay.

07:19.981 --> 07:22.733
So I did some digging on Fiona.

07:22.733 --> 07:26.404
Turns out that she was
in a really bad car accident as a kid.

07:27.071 --> 07:29.240
Brain surgery... Almost died...

07:29.240 --> 07:32.618
Yet somehow, she still managed
to become a neuropsychologist.

07:33.619 --> 07:36.664
Maybe the head trauma
is why she never got Callings.

07:36.664 --> 07:40.543
Well, she's in a never-ending Calling now.
We gotta do something.

07:45.047 --> 07:47.758
<i>If she hadn't given me that clue
when I was in the glow,</i>

07:47.758 --> 07:50.720
<i>I never would've figured out
divine consciousness.</i>

07:51.846 --> 07:54.432
She can't tell us about her Calling here,

07:55.016 --> 07:57.810
but maybe I can see her Calling
on the plane.

07:57.810 --> 08:00.938
Like, if I sit in her seat
like I did with Joe,

08:00.938 --> 08:03.107
maybe I can solve her Calling.

08:07.069 --> 08:09.071
[mysterious music plays]

08:11.073 --> 08:12.867
[seagulls squawking]

08:18.956 --> 08:20.541
I've never sailed a day of my life,

08:20.541 --> 08:23.544
but I got this sudden urge
to just hop on one of these boats,

08:23.544 --> 08:26.547
sail out to sea, and just...
just keep on going.

08:27.965 --> 08:33.262
You can, uh... You can keep the seven seas.
I would kill for a five-minute run.

08:33.888 --> 08:35.389
It's funny what you miss.

08:40.144 --> 08:43.189
Excuse me, sir.
Can we have a moment of your time?

08:43.773 --> 08:44.774
Hmm.

08:44.774 --> 08:47.151
Every time a cop has asked
for a moment of my time,

08:47.151 --> 08:48.486
it's been about my son.

08:49.570 --> 08:50.947
Whatever he's done now,

08:51.739 --> 08:53.115
it is of no concern of mine.

08:53.115 --> 08:55.409
Do you mind me asking who your son is?

08:57.370 --> 08:58.496
Eagan Tehrani.

08:58.496 --> 09:00.581
[suspenseful music plays]

09:23.354 --> 09:25.106
[guard] Oh my God. What is that?

Now!

09:43.457 --> 09:44.667
[grunting]

09:48.045 --> 09:49.255
How did this happen?

[medical device beeping]

09:54.594 --> 09:56.596
[theme music plays]

10:04.478 --> 10:08.107
They disappeared together.
Makes sense that they came back together.

10:08.107 --> 10:11.819
Yeah. Fiona could be the other half
of the mystery of Daly's return.

10:11.819 --> 10:15.698
Zimmer has Daly locked up,
but we have Fiona.

10:15.698 --> 10:18.868
If we just talk to her,
maybe we can figure all this out.

10:21.454 --> 10:23.748
Dr. Bahl, we need you.

10:23.748 --> 10:26.584
This man collapsed. Can you help him?

10:27.793 --> 10:28.961
[Saanvi] His face.

10:29.712 --> 10:32.548
He's dead. How did this happen?

10:32.548 --> 10:34.634
The how and the where
are not your concern.

10:34.634 --> 10:37.345
Your job is to find out
what the hell this is.

10:40.806 --> 10:42.224
Step-- Stay back, please.

10:42.224 --> 10:44.810
I just need to talk to Ben.

10:44.810 --> 10:45.978
Go ahead.

10:48.773 --> 10:51.776
I just got a text from Jared. You're not
gonna believe who owns the boat.

10:53.277 --> 10:54.695
Eagan's father.

10:55.363 --> 10:56.572

Tell me what you need.

11:21.597 --> 11:23.265
[exhales deeply]

11:24.392 --> 11:27.186
[Nazir] I've known trouble,
and I've known danger.

11:27.728 --> 11:30.272
I've made sure
they're no longer factors in my life.

11:31.065 --> 11:34.276
My wife and I have worked hard
to put that behind us.

11:34.902 --> 11:36.237
Now we have this boat.

11:37.071 --> 11:39.281
We've cashed in our pensions,

11:39.281 --> 11:42.201
and we have been dreaming about this trip.

11:42.868 --> 11:44.578
Our first stop is the Caribbean islands.

11:46.288 --> 11:50.835
Look, if my son told you
that I'm in danger, it's a lie.

11:50.835 --> 11:52.169
It only benefits him.

11:53.003 --> 11:56.006
This I can tell you
from many years of experience.

11:59.093 --> 12:01.512
I thought you would've had
a better poker face.

12:01.512 --> 12:02.972
That means something to you.

12:02.972 --> 12:04.724
It means something to my mom.

12:04.724 --> 12:08.602
It's called the Faravahar. Supposed to be
a reminder of good conduct for the soul.

12:08.602 --> 12:10.646
She got me one just like it.

12:12.356 --> 12:13.899
She wasn't big on subtlety.

12:15.109 --> 12:17.570
All it meant to me was
the easy 250 I got at the pawn shop.

12:17.570 --> 12:19.989
- She still wearing hers?
- [Eagan] I have no idea.

12:19.989 --> 12:23.200
I haven't seen or heard from my parents
since before we left for Jamaica.

12:24.994 --> 12:27.037
Wait. That's a lie.

12:27.705 --> 12:31.751
I got one voice mail from my father
after we miraculously returned.

12:32.251 --> 12:35.296
It said, "You may be back,
but you are not welcome here."

12:36.881 --> 12:40.009
I saw that necklace around the neck
of a woman who was in trouble.

12:40.009 --> 12:42.052
Now, do you think
that could've been your mother?

12:43.304 --> 12:45.097
Sorry, I've got nothing.

12:45.848 --> 12:48.476
You mean you don't care
if your own mother's in danger?

12:48.476 --> 12:51.645
I'm telling you, I wouldn't have
the slightest idea how to help.

12:51.645 --> 12:55.107
They don't care what happens to me.
I don't care what happens to them.

12:55.608 --> 12:56.692
Works for us.

Mr. Tehrani, we now have information.
This was not about you.

13:14.335 --> 13:15.753
It was about your wife.

13:15.753 --> 13:17.004
Where is she now?

13:17.004 --> 13:19.173
Uh, she's at home. Um...

13:19.173 --> 13:22.885
Usually, she never misses a sailing day,
but this morning she said she was sick.

13:23.928 --> 13:24.970
Let me call her.

13:24.970 --> 13:25.930
[phone beeps]

13:29.767 --> 13:30.810
She's not answering.

13:31.602 --> 13:33.562
Okay, trust me.
I think your wife is in danger.

13:33.562 --> 13:35.022
- We should go.
- [Jared] Let's go.

13:35.022 --> 13:37.107
[foreboding music plays]

13:38.484 --> 13:40.402
[indistinct chatter]

13:42.154 --> 13:43.364
[knocking]

13:50.996 --> 13:51.831
[sighs]

13:51.831 --> 13:54.750
Nina, you're a good surprise
on a bad morning.

13:57.336 --> 13:58.379
Guess what?

13:58.379 --> 14:02.508
Mommy just told me we're finally gonna
live in a real home like a real family.

14:03.968 --> 14:06.887
What do you mean? Are you leaving me?

14:06.887 --> 14:09.473
My uncle said we could live with him
in San Diego.

14:09.473 --> 14:12.142
They have
a really big zoo there with tigers.

14:12.142 --> 14:13.686
Mommy said I could visit.

14:13.686 --> 14:14.979
You can't go.

14:15.938 --> 14:17.398
I have no one else.

14:18.023 --> 14:19.859
But I have to go with my mommy.

14:21.318 --> 14:22.361
[sighs]

14:22.361 --> 14:24.280
I should've known you'd leave me.

14:24.280 --> 14:26.657
Everyone I love is taken from me,
even my daughter.

14:26.657 --> 14:27.700
You have a daughter?

14:27.700 --> 14:31.620
Yes, but they won't let me see her.
They've turned her against me.

14:32.329 --> 14:36.333
But you're special.
There has to be some way you can see her.

14:37.209 --> 14:39.003
Maybe God will give you a way.

14:43.048 --> 14:44.466
I think God already did.

14:47.928 --> 14:51.390
All right, this is the same exact color
as I'm wearing right now, okay?

14:51.390 --> 14:54.101
Remember how I showed you?
And we can match.

14:54.101 --> 14:57.021
So just sit here
and give it a try, all right?

15:04.820 --> 15:05.738
Okay.

15:06.447 --> 15:10.326
Remember, Fiona's seat number is 23B.

15:10.326 --> 15:11.327
All right?

15:12.119 --> 15:13.329
[suspenseful music plays]

15:13.329 --> 15:14.663
[exhales deeply]

15:21.003 --> 15:23.005
[thunder rumbling]

15:23.005 --> 15:25.174
[mysterious music plays]

16:07.257 --> 16:09.593
[panting]

16:09.593 --> 16:11.095
I couldn't sit in Fiona's seat.

16:11.095 --> 16:13.263
There was a huge olive tree growing
out of it.

16:14.098 --> 16:15.057
Olive tree?

16:16.058 --> 16:18.394
Not apple, like where you found her?

16:18.394 --> 16:21.730
No. There was one growing
from inside the cockpit too.

16:27.736 --> 16:28.862
Cal,

16:29.405 --> 16:31.699
I can see these.

16:40.499 --> 16:41.750
I can feel them.

16:44.128 --> 16:45.129
That's new.

16:48.257 --> 16:50.092
Hold these. Hey, uh, get back.

16:50.092 --> 16:52.177
[mysterious music plays]

17:05.274 --> 17:06.567
Farnaz!

17:08.152 --> 17:09.570
Farnaz, are you here?

17:12.698 --> 17:13.574
[Michaela] Clear!

17:14.700 --> 17:17.995
She should be here. She would never
leave the house with the door open.

17:23.709 --> 17:25.002
Unless she was forced to.

17:33.260 --> 17:34.887
[Eden] One, two, three.

17:37.473 --> 17:38.640
Your turn.

17:42.644 --> 17:46.565
Would you mind spinning
for me again, precious?

17:53.238 --> 17:55.616
You used to play this game with Angelina.

17:56.867 --> 17:57.701
Right?

17:58.619 --> 18:01.455
I know some people say
pretty mean things about her,

18:02.039 --> 18:03.290
but they're not true.

18:04.792 --> 18:08.170
She loves you so much.

18:09.671 --> 18:11.090
She'll love you forever.

18:11.965 --> 18:14.093
[humming]

18:21.934 --> 18:23.936
[footsteps approaching]

18:25.437 --> 18:26.396
I'll be back.

18:28.398 --> 18:30.150
[Eden humming]

18:30.150 --> 18:32.236
[suspenseful music plays]

18:38.367 --> 18:40.285
[humming]

18:50.546 --> 18:52.589
Okay. Do you notice anything missing?

18:52.589 --> 18:55.467
Was there anything valuable that--
Do you have a safe?

18:55.467 --> 18:57.386
Yes, we have a safe.

19:04.143 --> 19:04.977
It's all gone.

19:04.977 --> 19:07.146
All of it. The money for the trip.

19:07.146 --> 19:08.897
Our life savings.

19:09.982 --> 19:11.400
My poor Farnaz.

19:11.400 --> 19:13.277
- What has happened to her?
- [door opens]

19:14.027 --> 19:15.779
- Do you hear that?
- [door closes]

19:16.405 --> 19:17.239
Stay there.

19:19.533 --> 19:21.618
They could've returned, okay? Stay here.

19:21.618 --> 19:23.829
And let you have all the fun?
I don't think so.

19:26.039 --> 19:27.457
[gasps] Oh my God!

19:28.041 --> 19:28.917
Mrs. Tehrani?

19:30.127 --> 19:32.045
It's okay, ma'am. We're with your husband.

19:32.880 --> 19:35.007
Oh. [speaks Farsi]

19:35.007 --> 19:37.801
- Oh, I was so worried.
- I'm fine.

19:37.801 --> 19:39.636
What happened? Where have you been?

19:39.636 --> 19:41.597
It's okay. I'm fine. I'm fine.

19:41.597 --> 19:44.349
But, uh, they took everything.

19:45.392 --> 19:47.352
I was at the police station...
[clears throat]

19:47.352 --> 19:49.062
...to report... to report it.

19:52.024 --> 19:53.817
I hope you spoke
with Detective Baker there.

19:54.526 --> 19:58.572
If, for some reason, they gave you Lao,
I'll call and get your case transferred.

19:58.572 --> 20:01.658
Oh, no, that won't be necessary.

20:01.658 --> 20:05.078
I did. I... I did speak to Detective Baker.

20:07.581 --> 20:09.583
It looks like
you may need medical attention.

20:09.583 --> 20:10.709
How did that happen?

20:11.210 --> 20:14.087
It sort of looks like an injury
you might get from breaking a window.

20:14.755 --> 20:17.257
Uh, I... I don't know what you mean.

20:17.841 --> 20:19.635
There's no Detective Baker at the station.

20:19.635 --> 20:22.012
It's clear what's actually happened here.

20:22.012 --> 20:25.349
Uh, the safe was not cracked,
because you took the money,

20:25.349 --> 20:29.186
and then you broke a window
to stage a robbery and injured your hand.

20:29.186 --> 20:32.272
My only question is, why?

20:33.440 --> 20:35.234
[crying] I'm sorry.

20:40.989 --> 20:42.282
[Cal] Any idea what they mean?

20:42.282 --> 20:44.743
[sighs] Nothing really exciting.

20:44.743 --> 20:49.831
Just olive trees, since ancient times,
have represented peace and friendship.

20:49.831 --> 20:53.043
Well, Daly and Fiona
weren't exactly best friends.

20:53.835 --> 20:55.379
What are we missing here?

20:55.379 --> 20:57.256
I wish I knew.

20:57.256 --> 20:58.757
[Fiona gasping]

21:03.303 --> 21:05.264
- [Olive] She can't breathe!
- Uh, what do we do?

21:06.181 --> 21:07.099
Sit her up. Sit her up.

21:10.310 --> 21:12.688
- What-- It's not helping!
- Call 9-1-1!

21:14.648 --> 21:18.068
Wait. If she ends up in the hospital,
she'll end up at the detention center.

21:18.068 --> 21:19.820
Dad said not to send her there.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.407
- Call Saanvi.
- How? She doesn't have a phone.

21:23.407 --> 21:26.535
Use your sapphire.
You have the same power as Angelina.

21:26.535 --> 21:29.621
She made Dad think he was seeing Mom.

21:29.621 --> 21:32.332
You can do the same.
Make Saanvi see Fiona.

21:32.332 --> 21:34.001
I don't wanna be Angelina.

21:34.001 --> 21:36.503
Well, Angelina was projecting lies.

21:36.503 --> 21:38.755
You're gonna be projecting the truth, Cal.

21:38.755 --> 21:43.010
Put exactly what you're seeing of Fiona
in Saanvi's mind.

21:43.010 --> 21:44.928
Then she can tell us what to do.

21:45.971 --> 21:47.472
Okay. I'll try.

21:47.472 --> 21:49.558
Just take deep breaths.

21:49.558 --> 21:52.853
Try to connect
with the divine consciousness.

21:54.062 --> 21:55.647
Find Saanvi.

21:55.647 --> 21:57.691
[mysterious whirring]

22:07.034 --> 22:08.243
Oh my God.

22:08.243 --> 22:10.412
Saanvi. Can you hear me?

22:10.996 --> 22:13.332
Cal? Cal, where are you?

22:13.332 --> 22:16.501
At home. I'm projecting a Calling
like Angelina did.

22:16.501 --> 22:17.711
What do you see?

22:18.295 --> 22:19.296
Fiona Clarke.

22:19.296 --> 22:21.214
Alive on a cot.

22:21.798 --> 22:22.799
Holy shit. It worked.

22:22.799 --> 22:25.969
Fiona's actually in our dining room,
but she can't breathe.

22:25.969 --> 22:27.637
I need you to tell me what to do.

22:27.637 --> 22:28.638
[door opens]

22:37.314 --> 22:39.024
- [wheezing]
- [door closes]

22:40.734 --> 22:43.236
Okay, I'm gonna need you
to move in closer, Cal.

22:45.906 --> 22:49.368
I need you to lay her flat
on her back. Gently.

22:49.368 --> 22:50.660
Lose the pillows.

22:51.286 --> 22:52.371
[Saanvi] <i>That's good.</i>

22:53.538 --> 22:57.292
Now I need you to listen
to both sides of Fiona's chest.

23:03.382 --> 23:05.258
I can only hear her breathe on the right.

23:05.258 --> 23:07.469
It's really shallow. Her lips are--

23:07.469 --> 23:11.014
They're turning blue. I see it.
Okay, Cal, listen to me.

23:11.598 --> 23:14.518
I think Fiona has punctured her left lung.
It is collapsing.

23:14.518 --> 23:16.645
So I'm gonna need you to operate.

23:17.646 --> 23:18.480
Operate?

23:24.069 --> 23:25.112
[door opens]

23:27.948 --> 23:31.034
- Your parents' life savings are gone.
- What?

23:31.034 --> 23:33.495
It appears your mother faked a robbery

23:33.495 --> 23:35.747
and used it to cover up
whatever she did with the money.

23:35.747 --> 23:38.792
And she's not talking.
Like mother, like son.

23:39.459 --> 23:42.295
My mother would never steal. Too devout.

23:43.713 --> 23:44.923
Unlike me.

23:46.133 --> 23:49.970
When I was a kid,
my dad kept this mason jar full of change.

23:50.637 --> 23:53.181
The thing was always overflowing,
so I figured he wouldn't notice

23:53.181 --> 23:56.101
if I borrowed a few coins
for an ice cream sandwich.

23:56.852 --> 24:00.230
"My son, the thief."
That's what he called me for years.

24:00.230 --> 24:01.523
But my mom?

24:02.691 --> 24:05.193
She spent those years praying for my soul.

24:06.778 --> 24:08.071
You got it mixed up.

24:08.071 --> 24:11.783
- You know the Callings don't mix it up.
- Your parents' future is at stake here.

24:13.660 --> 24:18.290
I'll tell you one thing.
This time, it's got nothing to do with me.

24:21.710 --> 24:22.627
[gasps]

24:26.423 --> 24:28.175
[wheezing]

24:28.175 --> 24:29.468
Ready.

24:30.051 --> 24:32.929
First, I'm gonna need you to feel
for Fiona's clavicle on the left side.

24:32.929 --> 24:34.681
Her collarbone. Can you feel it?

24:35.599 --> 24:36.516
Got it.

24:36.516 --> 24:40.562
Okay. Now move your fingers down.
Next, you're gonna feel her rib.

24:41.563 --> 24:45.734
I'm gonna need you to take that knife
and make a small incision.

24:46.985 --> 24:47.944
Cal?

24:50.489 --> 24:51.448
Cal?

24:51.448 --> 24:52.699
What's wrong?

24:52.699 --> 24:54.534
She wants me to cut Fiona.

24:54.534 --> 24:57.746
If you don't do what Saanvi tells you,
Fiona's gonna die.

24:59.831 --> 25:01.082
You can do this.

25:01.082 --> 25:02.792
[breathing heavily]

25:08.465 --> 25:09.716
Wait. Wait. You're back.

25:09.716 --> 25:11.718
[Cal] Sorry. It... It's hard to focus.

25:11.718 --> 25:13.220
I'm... I'm too nervous.

25:13.970 --> 25:15.388
[Saanvi] <i>I'm right here with you.</i>

25:15.388 --> 25:18.767
You can do this, Cal.
Just make the incision.

25:18.767 --> 25:20.852
[breathing heavily]

25:21.895 --> 25:23.355
[suspenseful music plays]

25:30.070 --> 25:32.656
- [Fiona wheezing]
- [Saanvi] <i>All right, good.</i>

25:33.323 --> 25:37.160
Now I want you to take your index finger
and push it into the cut.

25:37.744 --> 25:42.916
<i>Can you feel on the top and bottom side
of her lungs? On either side.</i>

25:42.916 --> 25:44.751
<i>That's where the straw is gonna go.</i>

25:45.335 --> 25:47.254
I feel it. Uh, straw.

25:47.254 --> 25:48.380
Okay.

25:49.005 --> 25:51.466
[Saanvi] <i>Now push the straw hard,</i>

25:51.466 --> 25:54.928
cutting through the muscle
without hitting the lung.

25:54.928 --> 25:56.388
How am I supposed to know?

25:56.388 --> 25:59.766
Just an inch,
and you're gonna hear a release of air.

25:59.766 --> 26:01.059
Come on.

26:01.977 --> 26:03.645
[Saanvi] <i>Her breathing is getting shallow.</i>

26:03.645 --> 26:06.189
We are running out of time, Cal.
You have to do this now!

26:10.610 --> 26:12.612
[air hissing]

26:14.072 --> 26:16.074
- [exhales]
- [sighs]

26:17.534 --> 26:19.077
We did it. She's breathing.

26:19.077 --> 26:20.620
Told ya!

26:30.922 --> 26:33.091
[indistinct chatter]

26:35.385 --> 26:39.097
All right, Eagan. Your mother
faked a robbery to steal her own money.

26:39.097 --> 26:40.682
It sounds like a family trait.

26:40.682 --> 26:43.101
You've gotta have some idea
of why she would do that.

26:43.101 --> 26:45.270
I don't know what she did or didn't do.

26:45.270 --> 26:48.690
All I know is I mean nothing to them,
so why should I care?

26:48.690 --> 26:50.150
[distorted whir]

27:07.459 --> 27:08.793
Ben?

27:09.336 --> 27:10.170
[exhales]

27:12.672 --> 27:17.052
What do you know about strings
or a net around an iron heart?

27:17.052 --> 27:19.846
Heart... strings.

27:21.806 --> 27:24.142
- That can't be right.
- What can't be right?

27:24.142 --> 27:27.312
Oh, Cheryl! You double-crossing...

27:27.312 --> 27:29.356
Who? What does she have to do
with your mother?

27:29.356 --> 27:30.440
Cheryl is...

27:31.066 --> 27:33.610
<i>was</i> my protégé.

27:33.610 --> 27:35.945
And she should have nothing to do
with my mother.

27:35.945 --> 27:39.282
But apparently, the saying is true.
There's no honor among thieves.
