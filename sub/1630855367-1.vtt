11:56.416 --> 11:58.416
Thanks, Claire. How was your summer?

Yo, Prem!

Help me stretch my hammies, bro.
I need to get loose.

12:46.083 --> 12:48.583
Sorry I'm late.
I was, you know, in high school.

12:48.666 --> 12:50.666
Oh, yeah. I texted you good luck, right?

12:50.750 --> 12:52.083
Nah, it's cool.

12:52.166 --> 12:54.875
Cool.
My phone was blowing up this morning.

12:55.458 --> 12:57.166
Like, I didn't have enough thumbs.

12:57.250 --> 12:58.833
-You know what I mean?
-Totally.

12:59.625 --> 13:00.958
Class was great, by the way.

13:01.041 --> 13:02.833
But some of those kids,

13:02.916 --> 13:04.791
no wonder
they always lose the Mathlympics.

for sure.

She's the best thing

13:20.291 --> 13:21.291
Wow.

13:21.375 --> 13:24.166
-Actually, I need to tell you something.
-[student] Amanda! Hey, girl!

13:24.250 --> 13:26.416
I think we should take a break
from hanging out.

13:26.500 --> 13:28.875
-Just for a while.
-Whoops! Sorry, fellas!

13:28.958 --> 13:30.166
Sorry, man.

13:30.916 --> 13:32.333
What do you mean, a break?

13:32.416 --> 13:34.208
You know, just a break.

13:34.291 --> 13:36.375
I need to make some time for Amanda.

13:36.458 --> 13:39.750
-Now there's school--
-We crush school. Everyone knows it.

13:39.833 --> 13:41.958
That's not what I wanna be known for,
you know?

13:42.041 --> 13:43.875
I mean, I'm not the math guy.

13:43.958 --> 13:45.500
That's just what people think
when we're together.

13:45.583 --> 13:46.875
The math guy?

13:46.958 --> 13:48.416
Sup, dorks?

13:48.500 --> 13:50.375
-Just ignore him.
-Sup, BK!

13:50.458 --> 13:52.125
J-Dog! Peep my new dance.

13:54.791 --> 13:56.541
-Stop.
-J-Dog?

13:56.625 --> 14:01.000
But Brooklyn's so mean to us,
and Sharn was held back.

14:01.083 --> 14:02.250
BK's nice to me.

14:02.333 --> 14:05.166
And Sharn says eighth grade's
nothing but a number.

14:05.250 --> 14:07.833
They need one more in their dance crew
for the Fall Talent Show.

14:07.916 --> 14:09.500
You're not a dance guy, are you?

14:09.583 --> 14:10.583
I don't know.

14:10.666 --> 14:14.000
My dad says if I just put myself
out there, I might like it.

14:14.083 --> 14:16.791
-[Brooklyn] Yo, J-Dog.
-[Sharn] J-Doggy Dog! Come here!

14:17.416 --> 14:19.333

[raindrops falling]

14:31.416 --> 14:34.041
[mother] Prem, you will not believe
what happened at work today.

14:34.125 --> 14:36.333
Ronda was measuring a diuretic
for a patient,

14:36.416 --> 14:39.708
and she was using deciliters
instead of cubic centimeters.

14:39.791 --> 14:42.250
I was like,
"Honey, he's gonna pee forever."

14:42.333 --> 14:44.958
Ronda, more like Wrongda. [chuckles]

14:47.166 --> 14:48.166
Wrongda.

14:48.708 --> 14:51.375
Mmm. So, how'd you do in math today?

14:51.458 --> 14:53.583
It was good. We had a quiz.

14:54.791 --> 14:57.333
-[mother] And?
-I was the only one who finished.

14:57.416 --> 14:58.791
There it is.

14:58.875 --> 15:00.375
How was the rest of your day?

15:00.458 --> 15:03.000
I actually need some help with something.

15:03.666 --> 15:04.666
A homework assignment.

15:04.750 --> 15:06.041
Of course. Math homework?

15:06.125 --> 15:07.416
It's about Dad.

15:10.583 --> 15:11.583
Sorry.

15:11.666 --> 15:13.708
I know you don't like to talk about him.

15:15.750 --> 15:17.250
Suresh would want us to be happy.

15:17.333 --> 15:19.583
Not dissolve into tears
like some sad caterpillar.

15:19.666 --> 15:20.708
-Huh?
-This needs pepper.

15:20.791 --> 15:23.166
So, what do you need for your homework?

15:23.250 --> 15:25.791
-What was he known for?
-Known for?

15:25.875 --> 15:30.000
-I mean, was he smart?
-Definitely, but he wasn't a math guy.

15:30.083 --> 15:32.250
-What kind of guy was he?
-[sighs] There it is.

15:32.333 --> 15:35.541
I'll never know who I am
unless I know who he was.

15:35.625 --> 15:36.625
He was…

15:38.666 --> 15:41.208
funny, confident, handsome.

15:41.291 --> 15:44.000
-He was like you. Everyone loved him.
-Doesn't sound like me at all.

15:44.083 --> 15:46.166
I'm sorry.
I don't really know how to help.

15:46.250 --> 15:48.083
Just tell me anything.

15:48.166 --> 15:50.875
Tell me about the night
that photo was taken.

15:55.250 --> 15:56.750
That was a very long time ago.

15:57.458 --> 15:59.333
What's the Leopard Lounge?

16:00.916 --> 16:02.458
It's the club where we met.

16:02.541 --> 16:04.666
-Like a dance club?
-A hip-hop club.

16:04.750 --> 16:06.458
Your father had a real way with words.

16:06.541 --> 16:08.833
Wait. Dad was a rapper?

16:08.916 --> 16:11.875
How else do you think he came up with,
"The world's best never rest"?

16:11.958 --> 16:13.958
Mom, that is so cool.

16:14.041 --> 16:15.083
Was he good?

16:17.833 --> 16:18.875
He was…

16:20.416 --> 16:22.208
one of the best I've ever seen.

16:24.375 --> 16:25.958
I wish you could've seen him.

16:32.416 --> 16:36.333
Sometimes I forget how he looked
and how he sounded.

16:43.541 --> 16:44.541
Okay. [chuckles]

16:44.625 --> 16:49.541
So, when I was in nursing school,
we used to go dancing on the weekends.

16:50.125 --> 16:53.708
My girlfriends told me about this place.
It was poppin'.

16:59.750 --> 17:02.958
[mother] And the Leopard Lounge had
this thing called Freestyle Tuesdays.

17:03.041 --> 17:04.375
You said you only went on weekends.

17:04.458 --> 17:06.541
Well, some Tuesdays. Not if we had exams.

17:06.625 --> 17:08.250
I don't need to explain myself.

17:08.333 --> 17:09.791
Anyway, you were at the club.

17:09.875 --> 17:12.333
We were at the club,
and my girlfriends were saying…

17:12.416 --> 17:14.791
This emcee's an underground legend.

17:14.875 --> 17:16.750
-Blah, blah, blah, blah.
-Blah, blah.

17:16.833 --> 17:18.291
-Blah, blah. [chuckles]
-Why are they…

17:18.375 --> 17:19.583
I wasn't really listening.

17:19.666 --> 17:23.083
-Blah, blah, blah.
-Blah, blah, blah, blah.

17:23.166 --> 17:25.708
I had a lot on my mind, like school--

17:25.791 --> 17:27.958
Priya, stop thinking about Doug. Okay?

17:28.041 --> 17:29.958
It's over. He's not even that cute.

17:30.041 --> 17:31.375
Who's Doug?

17:31.458 --> 17:33.458
Who? I don't know.
I can't really remember--

17:33.541 --> 17:36.666
Good thing we stopped you
from getting that tattoo of his name, huh?

17:36.750 --> 17:38.666
We literally saved your butt.

17:50.208 --> 17:52.708
[friend 1] Hey, girl.
We'll go grab our drinks.

17:54.750 --> 17:58.291
So, we get in, and we're waiting
for the show to start when--

17:58.375 --> 17:59.708
[person] Excuse me.

17:59.791 --> 18:01.583
["My Heart Will Go On" playing]

18:06.791 --> 18:09.583
I don't have a line.
I just wanted to meet you.

18:11.958 --> 18:13.250
My name's Suresh.

18:14.625 --> 18:16.208
-I'm not interested.
-[song stops]

18:16.291 --> 18:18.583
-Okay. [chuckles]
-That's what you said to Dad?

18:18.666 --> 18:20.375
I didn't feel like being hit on.

18:20.458 --> 18:22.291
-Would you like to have a drink?
-No.

18:22.375 --> 18:24.708
I don't drink anything ever.

18:24.791 --> 18:26.750
-Then why are you in a nightclub?
-Thank you. Bye.

18:26.833 --> 18:28.333
I wanna walk away. I really do.

18:28.416 --> 18:30.708
-Please do.
-Yes. You've set a clear boundary.

18:30.791 --> 18:33.583
The only problem is
you're the prettiest girl in the room.

18:33.666 --> 18:35.958
-Oh?
-And I just have this thing inside of me

18:36.041 --> 18:37.833
that also tells me that
you're the smartest.

18:37.916 --> 18:41.125
Like you probably got a--
What, 1550 on the SATs?

18:41.208 --> 18:42.208
[scoffs] Excuse me?

18:42.291 --> 18:43.708
-1600, see?
-Thank you.

18:43.791 --> 18:46.333
-I went low so that I--
-How did you know I was smart?

18:46.416 --> 18:50.000
I could tell from your footwear,
'cause it's very sensible for a nightclub.

18:50.083 --> 18:51.666
-Also, if it gets cold…
-[Priya] Uh-huh.

18:51.750 --> 18:54.333
…you've got the turtleneck motif.

18:54.416 --> 18:55.791
-It's mesh.
-Mm-hmm.

18:55.875 --> 18:58.416
Mom, don't shut him down.
You need to make a baby.

18:58.500 --> 19:02.250
Listen, I got a thing to do, but if you
change your mind about that drink--

19:02.333 --> 19:04.541
-Don't hold your breath.
-You remind me of my mother.

19:04.625 --> 19:05.750
I love you. Goodbye.

19:05.833 --> 19:07.666
So cold.

19:07.750 --> 19:10.000
Well, yeah,
'cause you know he's your dad now.

19:10.083 --> 19:12.958

he could've been a psycho axe murderer.

19:13.041 --> 19:14.208

19:39.541 --> 19:41.750
-[Doug] …what to do, but you were gone.
-Doug, listen.

19:41.833 --> 19:42.833
You're so checked out.

19:42.916 --> 19:44.458
I can't believe you missed the show.

19:44.541 --> 19:46.875
-I can't believe you're so judgy.
-Are you listening to me?

19:46.958 --> 19:50.541
Doug, I'm sorry. I think I just
fell in love with the idea of you.

19:50.625 --> 19:52.750
But you have no culture, Doug.

35:38.125 --> 35:41.458
I wrote this script
that's like this historical movie,

35:41.541 --> 35:43.416
but the setting is right now,

35:43.958 --> 35:48.708

from a thousand years in the future.

35:48.791 --> 35:49.916
It's ahead of its time.

35:50.000 --> 35:51.375
But what about the Mathlympics?

35:51.458 --> 35:52.958
-Ms. Sage said--
-Stop playing.

35:53.041 --> 35:55.333
-Those other teams got, like, 50 kids.
-They got uniforms.

35:55.416 --> 35:57.083
-Know what we got on that quiz?
-G's.

35:57.166 --> 35:59.833
-Ms. Sage had to make up a grade for us.
-That's how bad it was.

35:59.916 --> 36:01.958
-We're not math kids like you.
-I'm not a math kid.

36:02.041 --> 36:03.791
Okay, then what are you into?

36:06.458 --> 36:07.458
Rap.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.000
Mostly rap.

36:11.083 --> 36:12.291
Lots of-- Lots of rap.

36:12.375 --> 36:14.666
Okay.
What are your top five favorite emcees?

36:17.333 --> 36:18.333
Only five?

36:18.416 --> 36:21.000

Emcee Escher.

36:30.708 --> 36:32.500
That dude that does the trippy drawings?

36:32.583 --> 36:34.541
No, it's another guy.

36:36.375 --> 36:40.250
My dad was a rapper,
so he's probably my favorite.

36:40.333 --> 36:41.541
[Gabe] For real?

36:41.625 --> 36:43.250
He was an underground legend.

36:44.000 --> 36:47.208
He did Freestyle Tuesdays at this club,
the Leopard Lounge.

36:47.291 --> 36:49.500
-What's his name?
-Probably haven't heard of him.

36:50.916 --> 36:52.125
He died when I was five.

36:53.125 --> 36:54.125
Cancer.

-Oh, man, that sucks.
-Sorry, dude.

55:52.750 --> 55:55.791
Acting like he never existed
isn't moving on.

55:57.666 --> 55:59.166
I'm not doing this with you.

55:59.666 --> 56:01.166
-Give me the notebook. Now.
-No.

56:01.250 --> 56:03.708
-He'd want me to have it.
-You don't know what he'd want.

56:03.791 --> 56:04.791
You didn't know him.

56:10.958 --> 56:14.791
I mean, Suresh didn't want you to be him.

56:15.541 --> 56:18.500
He wanted you to work hard
and get good grades, a good job--

56:18.583 --> 56:19.625
So I can be you?

56:22.375 --> 56:23.375
[sighs]

56:27.875 --> 56:29.875
[Ms. Sage] Okay.
I've got the 50 Lunchables.

56:29.958 --> 56:31.250
I'll add the 30 granola bars.

56:31.333 --> 56:34.750
And that'll be enough for
the State Mathlympics snack table.

56:34.833 --> 56:37.291

It's right around the corner, people.

56:37.375 --> 56:38.916
We still haven't locked in a judge,

56:39.000 --> 56:41.916
but I got a soft yes
from Neil Patrick Harris.

56:42.000 --> 56:44.708
[laughs] You know, I taught Neil.

56:44.791 --> 56:47.291
He was actually a great math student.

56:47.791 --> 56:49.625
He could've been an accountant.

about performing here tonight.

01:01:17.375 --> 01:01:18.500
He was an emcee.

01:01:18.583 --> 01:01:20.958
-Maybe you saw him?
-A lot of people perform here, kid.

01:01:21.041 --> 01:01:22.416
But he was an underground legend.

01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:25.583
The best rapper in the city,
maybe even the whole world.

01:01:25.666 --> 01:01:27.791
Sick. Can he do a set here tonight?

01:01:28.583 --> 01:01:30.208
No, he can't.

Man, Suresh.

01:01:40.041 --> 01:01:41.833
[laughs] Nobody did it better.

01:01:41.916 --> 01:01:43.083
So he really was here.

01:01:43.166 --> 01:01:45.583
[chuckles] Yeah, he was here all the time.

01:01:45.666 --> 01:01:47.208
Man never knew how to shut up.

01:01:47.291 --> 01:01:48.750
-[all chuckle]
-That's definitely him.

01:01:48.833 --> 01:01:50.083
Yeah? [chuckles]

01:01:50.958 --> 01:01:52.125
I heard that he…

01:01:54.791 --> 01:01:55.791
I'm sorry.

01:01:57.291 --> 01:01:59.916
Hey. I-I have a picture of him down there.
You wanna see it?

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.000
Yeah.

01:02:02.833 --> 01:02:04.458
[bartender sighs] Yeah.

01:02:06.125 --> 01:02:07.708
What's this?

01:02:07.791 --> 01:02:10.000
[bartender]
That's your dad doing his thing.

01:02:10.750 --> 01:02:12.333
But he was an emcee.

01:02:12.416 --> 01:02:14.083
Oh, I know. [chuckles]

01:02:14.166 --> 01:02:16.208
We worked together for five years.

01:02:16.708 --> 01:02:18.541
He talked a better game than anyone.

01:02:18.625 --> 01:02:21.250
And his favorite thing
to talk about was hip-hop.

01:02:21.333 --> 01:02:23.791
[Suresh] Nas had Primo. Pac had Dre.

01:02:23.875 --> 01:02:25.958

is not gonna age well.

Listen, I'm the expert, okay?

01:02:39.625 --> 01:02:42.708
And I'll tell you all, I'm gonna be
at the top of the list one day.

01:02:42.791 --> 01:02:44.750
Yo, Skee-Lo. One more.

01:02:44.833 --> 01:02:45.833
I've been waiting.

01:02:45.916 --> 01:02:48.500
Fine, but only because I'm scared of you.

01:02:49.541 --> 01:02:50.541
Dad?

01:02:50.625 --> 01:02:52.041
Suresh had big dreams.

01:02:52.125 --> 01:02:54.333
The way he talked about it,
it was like he was his own hype man.

01:02:54.416 --> 01:02:55.708
All right, grumpy. Here you go.

01:02:55.791 --> 01:02:57.541
This one's on me because I made you wait.

01:02:57.625 --> 01:02:58.625

01:02:58.708 --> 01:03:02.291
the man pouring you your drink right now
is gonna be a world-famous rapper.

01:03:02.375 --> 01:03:03.375
[scoffs] Okay.

01:03:03.458 --> 01:03:04.458
Oh, you laugh.

01:03:04.541 --> 01:03:06.125
But I've been grinding on my rhymes.

01:03:06.208 --> 01:03:08.250
I will be doing shows.
I'm gonna do features.

01:03:08.333 --> 01:03:09.541
I'll put out a album.

01:03:09.625 --> 01:03:13.208
And everything in this book will make me
the World's Best Emcee. Okay?

01:03:13.291 --> 01:03:14.291
You heard it here first.

01:03:14.375 --> 01:03:15.375

01:03:15.458 --> 01:03:17.375
Make your next move your best move, huh?

01:03:17.458 --> 01:03:20.000
-Put me on tonight.
-I can't do it. I need you back here.

01:03:20.083 --> 01:03:22.625
-We have that bachelor party later.
-[sighs]

01:03:22.708 --> 01:03:24.583
[Corey] I should've put him on too.

01:03:24.666 --> 01:03:27.625
I mean, I would see him at open mics
after work with the fellas.

01:03:27.708 --> 01:03:29.541
-He had skills.
-But what happened?

01:03:29.625 --> 01:03:31.250
[Corey] Well, nothing happened.

01:03:31.333 --> 01:03:34.458
One day he quit, and I heard he moved
to Jersey and settled down, you know?

01:03:34.541 --> 01:03:35.458
Typical story.

-Yes, sir. One second.

-I'm leaking genius over here.

[Suresh] Okay.

01:03:50.666 --> 01:03:52.083
Oh, right.

01:03:52.166 --> 01:03:55.000
Give the man a free drink
and he drops it on the ground.

01:03:55.083 --> 01:03:57.750
Well done. I got it. I got it.

01:03:57.833 --> 01:03:59.083
You're not getting another one.

01:04:00.166 --> 01:04:02.000
Hey, Corey. We need a smaller broom.

01:04:02.083 --> 01:04:03.541
I'm gonna get carpal tunnels.

01:04:10.625 --> 01:04:12.958
[Gabe] What does that dude even know
about rap anyways?

01:04:13.041 --> 01:04:14.833
-He's just some bartender.
-Gabe!

01:04:14.916 --> 01:04:16.916
[Gabe] Which is a great job obviously.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.625

So your dad wasn't a rap legend.

01:04:18.708 --> 01:04:19.916
Doesn't mean you won't be.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.333
Shoot. My dad's a dentist.

01:04:21.416 --> 01:04:24.125
[Gabe]
Yeah, my dad's legit into camping. Like--

01:04:24.208 --> 01:04:26.291
[Mercedes] See? It doesn't mean anything.

01:04:30.291 --> 01:04:31.375
He failed.

01:04:32.208 --> 01:04:34.208
It means that's a part of my equation.

01:04:36.333 --> 01:04:39.250
Look, the real world isn't pass or fail.
