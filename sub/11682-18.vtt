WEBVTT

00:00.418 --> 00:03.118
<i>- My name is Michael Westen.</i> 
<i>- I used to be a spy until...</i>

00:04.559 --> 00:07.094
We got a burn notice
on you. You're blacklisted.

00:07.161 --> 00:09.530
<i>When you're burned,</i>
<i>you've got nothing --</i>

00:09.597 --> 00:12.083
<i>no cash, no credit,</i>
<i>no job history.</i>

00:12.150 --> 00:14.420
<i>You're stuck in whatever city</i>
<i>they decide to dump you in.</i>

00:14.488 --> 00:16.586
- Where am I?
- Miami.

00:16.654 --> 00:19.831
<i>You do whatever work</i>
<i>comes your way.</i>

00:19.898 --> 00:22.466
<i>You rely on anyone</i>
<i>who's still talking to you.</i>

00:22.534 --> 00:24.074
<i>A trigger-happy</i>
<i>ex-girlfriend...</i>

00:24.142 --> 00:25.709
Should we shoot them?

00:25.777 --> 00:28.287
<i>...an old friend who used</i>
<i>to inform on you to the FBI...</i>

00:28.354 --> 00:30.689
You know spies --
a bunch of bitchy little girls.

00:30.757 --> 00:33.164
<i>...family, too...</i>
<i>Hey, is that your mom again?</i>

00:33.232 --> 00:35.402
<i>...if you're desperate.</i>
<i>Someone needs your help, Michael.</i>

00:35.470 --> 00:37.905
<i>Bottom line --</i>
<i>as long as you're burned,</i>

00:37.973 --> 00:39.573
<i>you're not going anywhere.</i>

00:44.649 --> 00:46.152
You were there
in the beginning.

00:46.220 --> 00:48.188
It was a dazzling idea.

00:48.255 --> 00:50.356
Use burned spies
to carry out ops

00:50.424 --> 00:52.891
that legitimate intelligence
agencies wouldn't touch.

00:52.959 --> 00:54.860
And them came
Michael Westen.

00:54.928 --> 00:58.030
Unless you're willing to see
your girlfriend go to prison

00:58.097 --> 01:02.133
for the rest of her life,
you will do exactly what I say.

01:02.201 --> 01:03.668
He'll keep forcing you
to do his bidding.

01:03.735 --> 01:05.303
There is no end to this.

01:05.370 --> 01:07.107
Our only chance is to find out

01:07.175 --> 01:08.742
what Anson is planning
and stop it.

01:08.809 --> 01:10.712
We finally got something
on Anson I think we can use.

01:10.779 --> 01:13.549
Barry tracked Anson's money
to a corrupt law firm.

01:15.521 --> 01:16.855
Here's the deal, Vaughn --

01:16.922 --> 01:18.223
you agree to help me,

01:18.290 --> 01:20.492
and I'll get the CIA
to make your miserable life

01:20.559 --> 01:22.260
a little less miserable.

01:22.328 --> 01:24.129
Those numbers --
they're linked to real things!

01:24.197 --> 01:25.530
What real things?

01:25.598 --> 01:27.932
Anson isn't retiring.
He's rebuilding.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.567
The organization
that burned you,

01:29.635 --> 01:31.336
he's bringing that back
online.

01:38.878 --> 01:40.913
Well, you put it all together,
it makes sense.

01:40.980 --> 01:43.448
Anson picks up the pieces
of the old organization --

01:43.516 --> 01:45.651
everything the CIA
didn't find --

01:45.719 --> 01:48.690
and he's got himself an instant
recipe for mayhem.

01:48.758 --> 01:50.992
I know what will happen to me
if we get in his way.

01:51.060 --> 01:52.294
We can't let him do this.

01:52.362 --> 01:53.963
I'm gonna confront him
with it today.

01:54.032 --> 01:56.667
Today?

01:56.735 --> 01:59.037
Mike, I'm still going through
these files.

01:59.104 --> 02:00.905
I mean, I swear,
this guy has got angles

02:00.973 --> 02:02.274
like no one
I've ever seen.

02:02.342 --> 02:04.144
Just when you think
you got a handle on him,

02:04.212 --> 02:05.278
he just slips away.

02:05.346 --> 02:06.713
That's why we can't wait
any longer.

02:06.781 --> 02:08.749
What, are you just
gonna go by his office?

02:08.816 --> 02:10.884
You know, the D.I.A. security's
pretty tight.

02:10.953 --> 02:12.521
Sam, I'm doing
whatever it takes.

02:12.588 --> 02:15.291
I'm not gonna let a couple
of security guards stop me.

02:15.359 --> 02:17.327
You're not doing this alone.
I'm going with you.

02:17.395 --> 02:19.630
You can back me up with a sniper
rifle from across the street.

02:19.698 --> 02:23.001
No. I'm not just there to make
sure you don't get shot.

02:23.069 --> 02:25.237
If Anson doesn't back off
his plans,

02:25.305 --> 02:27.841
I'm gonna end this,
blackmail or no blackmail.

02:27.908 --> 02:29.075
Understood?

02:32.648 --> 02:35.483
I'm all set, Michael.
Where are you?

02:35.551 --> 02:38.420
Top floor of the parking garage.
See me?

02:38.488 --> 02:40.289
There you are.

02:40.357 --> 02:41.790
You think
you can take that shot?

02:41.858 --> 02:43.926
You just let him know it's over
and step aside.

02:43.994 --> 02:45.928
He agrees...

02:45.996 --> 02:48.664
Or he doesn't walk away.

02:48.732 --> 02:50.332
<i>In espionage,</i>

02:50.400 --> 02:52.434
<i>you often deal with people</i>
<i>who are working undercover --</i>

02:52.502 --> 02:53.969
<i>some legitimately,</i>

02:54.037 --> 02:56.071
<i>because their identity</i>
<i>needs to remain a secret,</i>

02:56.139 --> 02:58.840
<i>and some illegitimately,</i>

02:58.908 --> 03:00.142
<i>because they're betraying</i>
<i>the country</i>

03:00.209 --> 03:01.410
<i>they've sworn to protect.</i>

03:01.477 --> 03:03.412
<i>Either way,</i>
<i>they go to great lengths</i>

03:03.479 --> 03:04.913
<i>to keep their</i>
<i>regular life separate</i>

03:04.981 --> 03:06.749
<i>from their covert lives,</i>

03:06.816 --> 03:08.584
<i>keeping their secrets</i>
<i>far from view.</i>

03:08.652 --> 03:10.787
<i>Which is why there's nothing</i>
<i>quite so unsettling</i>

03:10.854 --> 03:13.590
<i>as seeing one of those secrets</i>
<i>show up in the wrong place</i>

03:13.658 --> 03:14.558
<i>at the wrong time.</i>

03:14.626 --> 03:17.762
Hello, Anson.

03:17.829 --> 03:20.065
Hello, Michael.

03:20.132 --> 03:21.500
I know what
you have planned.

03:21.567 --> 03:23.268
I'm here to tell you
that it's over.

03:23.336 --> 03:25.304
What is it
you think you know?

03:25.372 --> 03:27.240
Oh, I know.

03:28.942 --> 03:31.111
I <i>know</i> that you're trying
to rebuild the organization

03:31.179 --> 03:33.047
that burned me!
- Aah!

03:33.114 --> 03:36.717
That...ends...today!

03:36.785 --> 03:37.985
You're in no position
to make threats, Michael.

03:38.053 --> 03:38.986
I'm serious.

03:42.625 --> 03:44.159
Believe me --
I'm serious.

03:44.227 --> 03:46.595
Michael, listen to me.

03:48.698 --> 03:51.801
You're about to make
a very serious mistake.

03:51.869 --> 03:54.003
Do not do this!
Not now!

03:54.071 --> 03:56.974
Not when everything
you fought for is so close.

03:57.042 --> 04:00.577
Michael,
<i>don't</i> listen to him.

04:00.645 --> 04:04.549
I am not letting you put
the pieces back together.

04:06.152 --> 04:07.819
Pieces of what?

04:08.621 --> 04:10.489
A covert organization
that does things

04:10.557 --> 04:12.024
you happen
to disagree with?

04:12.092 --> 04:14.427
How's that any different
from the CIA?

04:14.495 --> 04:17.697
Or any one of the other acronyms
you work for, Michael.

04:17.765 --> 04:19.798
It is entirely different.
You ruined my life!

04:19.867 --> 04:21.134
Ruined your life?

04:21.202 --> 04:23.536
I <i>gave</i> you a life,
Michael.

04:23.604 --> 04:24.771
You were alone.

04:24.838 --> 04:26.205
You hadn't talked
to your family in years.

04:26.273 --> 04:29.242
The love of your life was lonely
and abandoned in Ireland,

04:29.310 --> 04:31.144
not sure if you were dead
or alive.

04:31.212 --> 04:33.747
Look at what you have now.

04:33.814 --> 04:36.050
You want to throw it
all away?

04:36.117 --> 04:39.253
<i>Can</i> you
throw it all away?

04:41.000 --> 04:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:51.434 --> 04:53.235
Michael.

04:55.973 --> 04:57.607
I didn't think so.

05:01.479 --> 05:03.447
This is good,
this is healthy,

05:03.514 --> 05:06.082
working all this out
for yourself.

05:06.150 --> 05:07.984
So, I tell you what.

05:08.051 --> 05:10.586
We're gonna forget
this ever happened.

05:10.653 --> 05:12.754
This isn't over.

05:12.822 --> 05:14.722
It <i>will</i> be, Michael.

05:14.790 --> 05:16.791
Very soon.

05:28.137 --> 05:31.137
<font color=#00FF00>Burn Notice 5x18</font>

Original Air Date on December 15, 2011

== sync, corrected by <font color="#00ff00">elderman</font> ==

05:34.417 --> 05:36.284
I thought you were ready
to end this!

05:36.352 --> 05:37.418
I thought we agreed --

05:37.486 --> 05:39.087
Fi, it's like
I told you before.

05:39.154 --> 05:41.623
If you had pulled that trigger,
he would have won.

05:41.690 --> 05:42.623
You <i>saw</i> him.

05:42.691 --> 05:43.892
He's afraid of me --
of us --

05:43.959 --> 05:45.994
which means there's time.
Time for what?!

05:46.062 --> 05:48.497
Time to find another way.

05:48.564 --> 05:49.631
That is just
wishful thinking!

05:49.699 --> 05:50.432
You are delaying
the inevitable!

05:50.500 --> 05:52.268
There is no happy ending!

05:52.335 --> 05:54.103
Knock it off,
both of you!

05:54.171 --> 05:57.441
Just stop yelling for a second,
will you, and listen.

05:57.508 --> 05:58.709
I got something here
I think we can use.

05:58.777 --> 06:00.878
Come on.

06:00.946 --> 06:02.947
I was looking
into this stuff

06:03.015 --> 06:05.984
that Anson bought
with his big pile of money.

06:06.052 --> 06:06.785
Check it out.

06:09.256 --> 06:10.690
What is it?

06:10.757 --> 06:12.258
Place up in Tampa.

06:12.326 --> 06:14.360
Used to belong to
a private military company.

06:14.427 --> 06:16.628
Guess what they kept
in there --

06:16.696 --> 06:17.796
weapons and explosives.

06:17.864 --> 06:18.864
If that's where Anson
keeps the T4

06:18.932 --> 06:21.066
he used to frame Fiona --

06:21.133 --> 06:22.600
My thought exactly.

06:22.668 --> 06:24.068
We could head up there
and check it out.

06:24.136 --> 06:25.503
I can't.
I have to go meet Pearce.

06:25.571 --> 06:26.704
She called with a CIA job.

06:26.772 --> 06:27.806
Fi and I can handle
going to Tampa.

06:29.275 --> 06:31.242
Assuming you still want
to nail the bastard, right?

06:34.947 --> 06:36.580
Fine.

06:36.648 --> 06:37.848
And, Mike,
whatever job she's given you,

06:37.916 --> 06:38.982
be careful, will you?

06:39.050 --> 06:40.451
I don't want you
getting shot

06:40.518 --> 06:42.086
just before
we cross the finish line.

06:51.095 --> 06:53.864
Have a seat.

06:53.931 --> 06:55.232
Busy around here today.

06:55.299 --> 06:57.167
Yes, it is.

06:57.235 --> 06:59.335
Big job just came down
from Langley.

06:59.403 --> 07:00.970
Do I get to know
what it is?

07:01.038 --> 07:03.272
Well, I guess
you probably should...

07:03.340 --> 07:05.207
Considering
you'll be running it.

07:05.275 --> 07:06.908
Congrats.

07:06.976 --> 07:08.810
You're in charge
of an official CIA team

07:08.878 --> 07:10.378
for the first time
since you got burned.

07:10.446 --> 07:11.946
It's a try-out of sorts.

07:12.014 --> 07:13.748
There's a general feeling you're
the best person for the job,

07:13.816 --> 07:17.152
but no one wants to be personally
responsible if you screw up.

07:17.219 --> 07:18.587
It's progress.

07:18.654 --> 07:20.623
A rendition op.
Who's the target?

07:20.690 --> 07:22.224
Reed Perkins.

07:22.292 --> 07:24.660
He freelances for hostile
governments in the Middle East,

07:24.728 --> 07:27.463
finding assets
willing to spy on the U.S.

07:27.531 --> 07:29.632
And we just learned
he's coming to sunny Miami

07:29.700 --> 07:31.100
for a security-policy
conference.

07:31.168 --> 07:32.869
Travels pretty heavy?

07:32.937 --> 07:34.704
Make that <i>very</i> heavy.

07:34.772 --> 07:36.672
Brass doesn't want us
grabbing him at the hotel --

07:36.740 --> 07:38.474
too many international bigwigs,
too much security.

07:38.541 --> 07:39.808
The plan is to grab him

07:39.876 --> 07:41.476
on the way from his plane
to the conference.

07:41.544 --> 07:45.280
As for the details,
well, you're the expert.

07:45.347 --> 07:49.149
So when do I get to meet
my new official CIA team?

07:49.217 --> 07:52.519
How does...now sound?

07:52.587 --> 07:55.388
They're in at
the firing range downstairs.

07:57.658 --> 07:58.758
Thank you for this.

07:58.826 --> 07:59.993
Just don't let me down.

08:09.304 --> 08:11.138
I'd like you to meet
Michael Westen.

08:11.206 --> 08:13.173
Michael, this is Nick Carnahan
on loan from the 1st

08:13.241 --> 08:14.775
Special Forces Operational
Detachment-Delta.

08:16.310 --> 08:17.177
- It's nice to meet you, sir.
- Thanks.

08:17.245 --> 08:18.845
And this is Rebecca Lang

08:18.913 --> 08:20.980
and Ryan Pewterbaugh with
the CIA's field division.

08:21.048 --> 08:22.215
It's a pleasure.

08:22.283 --> 08:23.683
I'm looking forward
to working with you.

08:23.751 --> 08:25.451
Good to meet you.

08:25.519 --> 08:26.719
I ran stateside support

08:26.787 --> 08:28.755
for some of your operations
in the '90s.

08:28.822 --> 08:30.223
Heard about
your burn notice.

08:30.291 --> 08:31.491
It was a raw deal.

08:31.559 --> 08:34.126
It's good to have you
back on the team.

08:34.195 --> 08:35.462
Well, I'd like
to remind everyone

08:35.530 --> 08:37.364
that we've got
less than 24 hours

08:37.431 --> 08:38.865
to plan this operation.

08:38.933 --> 08:42.669
I suggest you get busy.

08:47.410 --> 08:49.511
<i>Abandoned facilities</i>
<i>are often used</i>

08:49.579 --> 08:51.246
<i>to cover up covert activity.</i>

08:51.314 --> 08:54.350
<i>Set up in a crumbling building</i>
<i>covered in graffiti,</i>

08:54.418 --> 08:56.218
<i>and no one takes much notice.</i>

08:56.286 --> 08:57.987
<i>There are ways of figuring out</i>

08:58.055 --> 09:00.422
<i>if a facility is</i>
<i>truly abandoned, however,</i>

09:00.490 --> 09:01.757
<i>like the power draw.</i>

09:01.825 --> 09:03.759
<i>If a building's</i>
<i>using electricity,</i>

09:03.827 --> 09:06.629
<i>chances are someone's home.</i>

09:06.697 --> 09:10.532
All right.
I think we got something here.

09:10.600 --> 09:11.867
Check this out.

09:11.935 --> 09:14.369
So, my readings from
the transformer are in blue.

09:14.437 --> 09:16.572
The info from the local
power company's in black.

09:18.408 --> 09:20.342
Yeah,
I don't do charts.

09:20.410 --> 09:22.544
Look, the point,
miss no-attention-span,

09:22.612 --> 09:24.446
is that there's a spike
every a.m.

09:24.514 --> 09:26.215
And then another one
around lunch.

09:26.282 --> 09:28.117
It's probably a microwave,

09:28.184 --> 09:30.519
so I think Anson's got someone
fricking living there.

09:30.587 --> 09:33.622
Well, that would account
for the new keypad on the door.

09:33.690 --> 09:36.258
Sam, that someone might know
what Anson's up to.

09:36.326 --> 09:38.494
Yeah, but come on, Fi.
You see the steel doors?

09:38.562 --> 09:40.296
That place is
pretty well defended.

09:40.363 --> 09:41.864
Yeah, well,
it's worth the risk.

09:41.932 --> 09:43.232
It's not just me.

09:43.300 --> 09:44.767
Michael's on the edge
of something very, very bad.

09:44.835 --> 09:45.801
You know it.

09:45.869 --> 09:47.036
All right, fine.

09:47.103 --> 09:48.904
We'll sneak in there,
have a little chat,

09:48.972 --> 09:50.139
but no explosives, okay?

09:50.207 --> 09:52.408
'Cause if that place
is storing RDX, forget it.

09:52.475 --> 09:55.677
I don't just blow things up.
I do have other skills.

09:55.745 --> 09:57.946
We're gonna need a truck.
A big rig.

09:58.014 --> 09:59.514
A truck?

09:59.582 --> 10:00.882
How am I supposed to find
a big rig in Tampa?

10:00.950 --> 10:02.016
I don't know.

10:02.084 --> 10:03.784
Call one of
your many friends.

10:03.852 --> 10:06.387
Steal it.
I can't do everything, Sam.

10:08.222 --> 10:11.358
<i>In a heavily populated</i>
<i>and high-traffic environment,</i>

10:11.426 --> 10:14.094
<i>a covert op has to leave</i>
<i>a small footprint</i>

10:14.162 --> 10:16.798
<i>and create as little</i>
<i>disturbance as possible.</i>

10:16.866 --> 10:19.333
<i>An urban snatch-and-grab</i>
<i>with a small team</i>

10:19.401 --> 10:21.169
<i>requires good intelligence.</i>

10:21.236 --> 10:25.307
<i>That begins with identifying</i>
<i>and tracking the target.</i>

10:25.375 --> 10:27.877
<i>It's not enough knowing</i>
<i>he'll be in town.</i>

10:27.945 --> 10:30.413
<i>You need to know</i>
<i>when his flight arrives,</i>

10:30.481 --> 10:32.148
<i>what vehicle he's driving,</i>

10:32.216 --> 10:35.552
<i>every detail down to where</i>
<i>he's gonna make a left turn.</i>

10:39.090 --> 10:41.158
- All right. Reed's moving.
- Stay sharp out there.

10:44.562 --> 10:47.665
So far, so good, Michael.
Reed's on schedule.

10:47.732 --> 10:50.468
And satellite tracking has him
headed your way.

10:50.535 --> 10:52.036
<i>Once your target is tracked,</i>

10:52.104 --> 10:54.338
<i>the next task</i>
<i>is to stop his vehicle.</i>

10:54.406 --> 10:55.940
<i>In an urban environment,</i>

10:56.008 --> 10:58.276
<i>this is usually done</i>
<i>with another vehicle</i>

10:58.343 --> 10:59.977
<i>in a precisely timed collision.</i>

11:00.045 --> 11:02.781
I got 50 bucks says
I can bring this guy's car

11:02.849 --> 11:05.150
to a complete stop
without my seatbelt.

11:05.218 --> 11:07.553
Yeah, I'll take a piece
of that action.

11:07.621 --> 11:08.788
I'll give you 100 bucks
if you wear it.

11:08.856 --> 11:09.890
I don't want anyone
getting hurt.

11:09.957 --> 11:11.759
Copy that.

11:11.826 --> 11:13.327
<i>Finally, you need a team</i>
<i>in place to go in</i>

11:13.394 --> 11:15.963
<i>before the smoke clears</i>
<i>and do the actual extraction.</i>

11:16.030 --> 11:17.998
<i>Do it right,</i>
<i>and you're in and out</i>

11:18.066 --> 11:19.967
<i>before anyone has time</i>
<i>to fire a shot.</i>

11:20.035 --> 11:22.136
Rebecca.

11:22.204 --> 11:24.038
- Hmm?
- You okay?

11:24.106 --> 11:26.742
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I'm always
like this before an op.

11:26.809 --> 11:28.677
I just want to move,
you know?

11:28.745 --> 11:31.180
How many operations
have you done?

11:31.248 --> 11:33.149
Checking my credentials,
hmm?

11:33.217 --> 11:34.450
You one of those guys

11:34.518 --> 11:36.953
that doesn't like working
with women in the field?

11:37.021 --> 11:39.757
If I couldn't work with women,
I'd be dead right now.

11:41.460 --> 11:42.927
Reed's headed our way.
It's a go.

11:42.995 --> 11:44.028
Wait's over.
You ready?

11:44.096 --> 11:45.330
Let's do this.

11:45.397 --> 11:47.232
Ryan, he's all yours.

11:47.299 --> 11:48.500
I'm ready. I'm ready.

11:48.568 --> 11:50.035
<i>With some planning,</i>

11:50.103 --> 11:51.370
<i>you can stop a large vehicle</i>
<i>with a much smaller one.</i>

11:51.438 --> 11:53.506
All right, going now.
Going now.

11:53.574 --> 11:55.007
<i>It's a matter of calculating</i>
<i>the physics involved</i>

11:55.075 --> 11:56.241
<i>and very precise timing.</i>

11:56.309 --> 11:57.901
Remember, Ryan,
we're targeting the rear,

11:57.926 --> 11:59.126
driver's side door.

11:59.645 --> 12:01.612
We need him alive and unharmed.

12:01.680 --> 12:03.247
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>when timing is that precise...</i>

12:03.315 --> 12:05.216
Coming your way.

12:05.283 --> 12:09.319
<i>...any obstacle whatsoever can</i>
<i>cause a very large problem.</i>

12:09.387 --> 12:10.420
Ryan, on your left!
Check your left!

12:10.488 --> 12:12.155
Bogey! Bogey! Bogey!

12:24.970 --> 12:26.705
Come on. We got to get after
him. He's getting away.

12:26.772 --> 12:28.640
Stop. It's too late.
He's already gone.

12:28.708 --> 12:31.410
Ryan?
Ryan! Do you copy?

12:31.478 --> 12:33.045
Ryan, do you copy?

12:33.113 --> 12:34.480
I'm okay.

12:34.547 --> 12:36.115
They got away.

12:39.500 --> 12:40.867
So, Michael,

12:41.335 --> 12:43.436
I just got off the phone
with the folks at Langley.

12:43.504 --> 12:44.904
This isn't good.

12:44.972 --> 12:47.373
Your first semi-official op
with the agency

12:47.440 --> 12:49.341
seems to have turned
into a very official disaster.

12:49.409 --> 12:51.944
This was supposed to be
the best team.

12:52.012 --> 12:53.279
It wasn't
the team's fault.

12:53.346 --> 12:55.314
It was a panicky driver
and some bad luck.

12:55.382 --> 12:56.348
It was an accident.

12:56.416 --> 12:57.917
Well, accident or no,

12:57.985 --> 12:59.985
now Reed Perkins gets to go
shopping for spies all weekend,

13:00.053 --> 13:01.587
and we can't do anything
about it.

13:01.655 --> 13:03.122
Reed doubled
his security --

13:03.189 --> 13:04.556
I think
there's another way.

13:04.624 --> 13:06.425
You said Reed
met his security detail

13:06.493 --> 13:07.994
when he got off the plane,
right?

13:08.061 --> 13:09.463
Yes?

13:09.530 --> 13:11.765
Well, if the security
doesn't travel with him,

13:11.832 --> 13:12.966
we can still do this.

13:13.034 --> 13:14.902
What exactly
are you thinking?

13:14.969 --> 13:16.970
Get someone on the plane
with him.

13:17.038 --> 13:20.007
Grab him after his security team
leaves but before takeoff.

13:20.074 --> 13:21.909
And how do you propose we get
someone on the plane with him?

13:21.977 --> 13:24.211
Reed's looking for an
American source he can turn.

13:24.279 --> 13:26.013
Let's give him one --

13:26.081 --> 13:27.748
someone that's valuable enough
to fly out of the country.

13:29.418 --> 13:31.485
Reed leaves Monday.

13:31.553 --> 13:33.087
Do you have that someone
in mind?

13:37.221 --> 13:38.588
<i>Getting the attention</i>
<i>of someone</i>

13:38.756 --> 13:40.823
<i>who recruits traitors</i>
<i>for a living is an art.</i>

13:40.891 --> 13:43.993
<i>You can't exactly run around</i>
<i>a security conference,</i>

13:44.060 --> 13:45.694
<i>yelling, "I want to betray</i>
<i>my country."</i>

13:45.762 --> 13:47.062
<i>You have to be subtle.</i>

13:47.130 --> 13:49.565
<i>Just make it known</i>
<i>you're desperate enough</i>

13:49.632 --> 13:52.467
<i>to do something stupid</i>
<i>and let the bad guy find you.</i>

13:52.535 --> 13:54.236
So, you're telling me
you have <i>no</i> positions.

13:54.304 --> 13:55.704
You're <i>not</i> hiring.
We just --

13:55.772 --> 13:57.439
- I was at CIFA. You know what CIFA is?
- I know.

13:57.507 --> 14:00.341
Son of a...

14:00.409 --> 14:01.910
Ugh, I've been to like 30
of these booths.

14:01.978 --> 14:03.345
Everyone's telling me
the same thing,

14:03.412 --> 14:04.579
and I just can't
believe that...

14:04.647 --> 14:06.748
...No one in this conference...

14:06.816 --> 14:09.083
...Is hiring.

14:09.151 --> 14:11.686
- The economy -- it's bad.
- Yeah.

14:11.754 --> 14:13.021
The economy.

14:13.088 --> 14:15.022
Yeah, that's what Uncle Sam said
when he laid me off.

14:15.090 --> 14:18.259
I'm sorry. I am.

14:18.326 --> 14:20.227
There.

14:20.295 --> 14:22.696
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.

14:22.764 --> 14:24.664
I have been working it up
in here, Mike.

14:24.732 --> 14:26.800
I've been complaining to pretty
much anyone who'll listen.

14:26.868 --> 14:28.435
People are giving me free stuff
from their booths

14:28.502 --> 14:29.869
just to get me
to go away.

14:29.937 --> 14:32.572
I got a pen, got a hat,
got a really nice travel mug.

14:32.640 --> 14:34.808
Any sign of Reed?

14:34.875 --> 14:36.676
I'm getting looks, but, you know,
it's hard to tell who's who.

14:36.744 --> 14:38.478
Well, keep at it.
It might take a while.

14:38.546 --> 14:39.880
Remember,
he needs to think

14:39.948 --> 14:42.717
that you're important enough
to take out of the country.

14:42.785 --> 14:44.786
Wait a minute.
I think I got something.

14:44.854 --> 14:47.122
Yeah,
I'll call you back.

14:51.494 --> 14:55.064
Well, you look like
you could use another drink.

14:55.132 --> 14:57.634
Always.

14:57.701 --> 15:01.338
You don't have a...little
name tag dealy-bop.

15:01.406 --> 15:03.073
What, you, uh -- you're not
with the conference?

15:03.141 --> 15:06.043
I am...
An unofficial visitor.

15:06.110 --> 15:07.878
May I join you?

15:07.946 --> 15:09.613
Knock yourself out,
man.

15:09.681 --> 15:10.948
Got to warn you,
though --

15:11.016 --> 15:12.349
if you're looking for
a free drink, I'm not the guy.

15:12.417 --> 15:14.918
I am a <i>little</i> short on cash
at the moment.

15:14.986 --> 15:17.020
Well,
I'll buy the drinks.

15:17.088 --> 15:18.455
Then you can definitely
sit your ass down.

15:18.522 --> 15:20.990
I'm Jesse Porter.

15:21.058 --> 15:23.259
I, uh, take it that
you're looking for work?

15:23.327 --> 15:26.429
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, you could say that.

15:26.497 --> 15:29.032
An associate of mine overheard
you at the conference.

15:29.100 --> 15:30.901
You <i>were</i> with
the Counterintelligence

15:30.969 --> 15:32.403
Field Activity Agency,
right?

15:32.471 --> 15:35.640
Yep, and now I'm not,
and I'll tell you why.

15:35.708 --> 15:38.910
The government is comprised
of stupid idiots

15:38.978 --> 15:41.079
who can't recognize
talent.

15:41.147 --> 15:44.549
I have a business proposition
for you, Mr. Porter.

15:44.617 --> 15:45.717
I <i>am</i> a man
who recognizes talent.

15:48.053 --> 15:49.787
I'm listening.

15:49.855 --> 15:53.758
I have a suite upstairs.
Let's go talk in private.

15:53.825 --> 15:56.460
Wow.

15:56.527 --> 15:57.561
This is nice, man.

15:57.628 --> 15:59.296
What is this,
the Presidential Suite?

15:59.363 --> 16:01.664
Yes, it is.

16:01.732 --> 16:04.935
I find it best to discuss
business in comfort.

16:05.003 --> 16:06.403
Yeah.
Uh, about that --

16:06.471 --> 16:08.305
if this is about
one of your --

16:08.373 --> 16:09.573
one of your
bodyguard gigs,

16:09.640 --> 16:10.974
I can tell you right now
that I'm not interested.

16:11.042 --> 16:12.342
Of course not.

16:12.410 --> 16:14.778
A man of your talent
should be doing something

16:14.846 --> 16:16.814
far more...rewarding.

16:16.882 --> 16:21.085
How, uh, rewarding
are we talking about?

16:21.153 --> 16:23.488
I work with some
very well-financed individuals

16:23.556 --> 16:25.456
who are curious
about your country's

16:25.524 --> 16:26.992
counterintelligence
activity.

16:27.059 --> 16:29.494
Selling secrets?

16:31.597 --> 16:33.131
Yeah, I'm gonna --

16:33.199 --> 16:34.799
I'm gonna have to give you
a "no" on that one.

16:34.867 --> 16:36.267
I get the death penalty
if I get caught,

16:36.335 --> 16:38.870
so,
thanks for your time.

16:38.938 --> 16:43.575
You <i>would</i> be well compensated
for your work, Mr. Porter.

16:43.643 --> 16:46.846
How much would it take?

16:46.913 --> 16:49.415
If I <i>was</i> to do this --
and I'm not saying that I am --

16:49.483 --> 16:51.984
I'd want to do it some place
Uncle Sam isn't watching,

16:52.052 --> 16:53.419
some place
out of the country.

16:53.487 --> 16:54.888
Fine.

16:54.956 --> 16:56.857
I'll make
the necessary arrangements.

17:00.028 --> 17:02.730
But I warn you --

17:02.797 --> 17:05.732
if you're wasting
my time...

17:05.800 --> 17:08.800
There are things far worse
than the gas chamber.

17:10.170 --> 17:12.271
I'll keep that in mind.

17:16.642 --> 17:19.611
<i>The key to breaching a building</i>
<i>is getting inside quickly</i>

17:19.679 --> 17:21.413
<i>and dealing with the occupants</i>

17:21.480 --> 17:23.315
<i>before they have time</i>
<i>to respond.</i>

17:23.383 --> 17:25.217
<i>When you can't use explosives,</i>

17:25.285 --> 17:27.553
<i>sometimes you have</i>
<i>to get creative.</i>

17:27.619 --> 17:29.322
<i>If you can find</i>
<i>utility equipment</i>

17:29.390 --> 17:31.458
<i>that is built into the wall,</i>

17:31.526 --> 17:33.560
<i>you just need a couple thousand</i>
<i>foot-pounds of torque</i>

17:33.628 --> 17:35.529
<i>to make yourself a door.</i>

17:39.802 --> 17:41.103
Do it!

18:07.130 --> 18:09.265
Hey!

18:09.333 --> 18:11.568
Unh-unh.
Put that away.

18:11.636 --> 18:15.072
Hey, sorry about the mess,
but, uh, we got to talk.

18:15.140 --> 18:18.843
Crazy lady,
get it through your skull --

18:18.911 --> 18:19.744
I don't know anything!

18:21.981 --> 18:23.782
You're sitting
on enough explosives

18:23.850 --> 18:25.284
to take out
half of Tampa.

18:25.351 --> 18:27.019
You didn't think to ask
a question or two?

18:27.086 --> 18:28.254
Have you met
that Anson guy?

18:28.321 --> 18:29.555
I didn't have
much of a choice.

18:29.623 --> 18:31.890
Well, you know, I assume
that has something to do

18:31.958 --> 18:33.425
with this warrant
for your arrest

18:33.493 --> 18:34.759
on sexual assault
charges?

18:34.827 --> 18:36.361
Three counts?

18:36.429 --> 18:38.496
Fi. We may have hit
the jackpot here.

18:38.564 --> 18:39.963
Check out this manifest.

18:40.031 --> 18:41.198
RDX explosives.

18:41.265 --> 18:43.167
High-pressured,
armor-piercing rounds.

18:43.234 --> 18:45.168
I mean,
if this is the same stuff

18:45.236 --> 18:48.506
that Anson used to set you up,
we can stop him cold right here.

18:48.573 --> 18:51.342
Look, I don't know what you
think you're gonna do, okay,

18:51.410 --> 18:53.111
but Anson's security
is good.

18:53.179 --> 18:54.612
The guy's
a class-a paranoid.

18:54.680 --> 18:56.081
And once he figures out
that you're here --

18:56.148 --> 18:57.415
Well, we're not gonna let him
figure it out.

18:57.483 --> 18:59.484
We're taking you and all this
to the police.

18:59.552 --> 19:02.621
No! You're not, okay?
He was real clear.

19:02.689 --> 19:04.857
If I ever take anything
out of this warehouse --

19:04.924 --> 19:05.891
even so much as a paperclip --
I'm dead.

19:05.959 --> 19:07.326
You're dead if we do.

19:07.393 --> 19:08.827
Okay, fine.
We'll leave the paper clips.

19:08.895 --> 19:11.730
Listen, Jake, this is not a job
with a great future.

19:11.798 --> 19:13.600
Just come with us
to the cops.

19:13.667 --> 19:15.268
We'll get you out
from under.

19:18.606 --> 19:19.840
All right. Yeah.

19:19.908 --> 19:21.074
But no one sees me walk out
of this place.

19:21.142 --> 19:22.442
Oh, stop worrying.

19:22.510 --> 19:24.978
First of all,
we'll be protecting you.

19:25.045 --> 19:26.946
Second of all...

19:27.014 --> 19:29.883
You don't have a choice.

19:43.463 --> 19:44.463
Okay, let's go.

19:44.531 --> 19:45.865
You're sure
it's all clear?

19:45.932 --> 19:47.600
Yeah, I'm sure.
Come on. Move it.

19:49.736 --> 19:50.936
Damn thing's beeping.
Hold on.

19:54.207 --> 19:55.741
Can you turn it off?

19:55.809 --> 19:57.610
I got it.

19:59.313 --> 20:01.013
Jake?

20:01.081 --> 20:02.347
Forget about it, buddy.

20:02.415 --> 20:04.283
I think I'm smarter
than a keypad, jackass!

20:04.350 --> 20:05.917
I think Anson's
tracking the stuff!

20:05.985 --> 20:07.386
- Shut up!
- Jake, now! Run!

20:07.453 --> 20:08.787
Let me work!

20:11.391 --> 20:13.392
- See?
- Like I told you -- there's nothing to --

20:27.239 --> 20:30.041
I don't understand.

20:30.109 --> 20:31.143
Why would Anson
kill his own guy?

20:31.210 --> 20:33.445
I got to call Mike.

20:33.513 --> 20:35.080
Yeah, Sam?

20:35.148 --> 20:37.483
Mike, bad news.
We found Anson's stash.

20:37.551 --> 20:39.518
We had it in our hand,
but he --

20:39.586 --> 20:40.986
he had trackers
on everything.

20:41.054 --> 20:42.654
He rigged the building
to a detonator!

20:42.722 --> 20:44.522
Sam, I'm just about
to meet with Anson,

20:44.590 --> 20:46.257
and you're telling me
I have nothing?

20:46.325 --> 20:47.592
Less than nothing,
actually.

20:47.660 --> 20:49.527
I mean, you should have seen
what he rigged up, Mike.

20:49.595 --> 20:51.429
It's just dumb luck
that me and Fi aren't dead.

20:51.497 --> 20:52.497
I'm sorry, Mikey.

20:52.565 --> 20:53.764
He's here.
I got to go.

20:55.033 --> 20:56.300
Hey, Michael.

20:56.368 --> 20:58.368
Looks like you just
got some bad news.

20:58.436 --> 20:59.636
Wouldn't happen to be

20:59.704 --> 21:01.671
about a weapons facility
up near Tampa, would it?

21:01.739 --> 21:03.306
I just got word myself.

21:03.374 --> 21:06.243
It is unfortunate,
but it just goes to prove

21:06.311 --> 21:09.847
why this little project I need
you to do is so necessary.

21:09.915 --> 21:12.149
What are you
talking about?

21:12.217 --> 21:13.518
Well, as your friends
just demonstrated,

21:13.585 --> 21:15.419
I can't rely on a network
of scrubs and losers

21:15.487 --> 21:16.954
like Jacob in Tampa.

21:17.022 --> 21:18.389
I need All-Stars,

21:18.457 --> 21:21.158
so, that elite CIA team
you've been running --

21:21.226 --> 21:23.594
they're gonna be
my new starting lineup

21:23.662 --> 21:26.030
because you're gonna
burn them for me.

21:26.098 --> 21:28.265
You want me to betray
my own team?

21:28.333 --> 21:29.533
Oh, don't be so dramatic.

21:29.601 --> 21:31.101
You're just gonna
make it look like

21:31.169 --> 21:32.703
Pearce helped them
steal some money

21:32.770 --> 21:34.371
from this Reed fellow
you've been targeting.

21:36.675 --> 21:39.610
You're just gonna plant a chip
in her computer during the job

21:39.678 --> 21:42.246
that links her to various...
shady bank accounts.

21:44.616 --> 21:46.650
No, Anson. No.

21:46.718 --> 21:48.419
I know --
it sounds wrong,

21:48.487 --> 21:50.487
but it's not so bad,
ultimately.

21:50.555 --> 21:51.522
If you do this,

21:51.589 --> 21:53.291
you and Jesse
walk away clean

21:53.358 --> 21:55.325
and Pearce and three people
you barely know

21:55.393 --> 21:56.827
have to get new jobs.

21:56.895 --> 22:01.899
If you <i>don't</i> do this,
Fiona goes to prison <i>forever</i>

22:01.967 --> 22:04.068
and dies in a cage.

22:04.136 --> 22:05.903
Which is worse?

22:05.971 --> 22:08.272
Right?

22:08.339 --> 22:11.541
So,
shall we finish this?

22:18.448 --> 22:20.448
It's smart, Michael.

22:20.516 --> 22:22.517
It's very smart.

22:34.110 --> 22:37.712
If I do what Anson's asking --
if I plant that memory card --

22:37.779 --> 22:39.847
Pearce and the team
get burned.

22:39.915 --> 22:42.350
And we just --
we just have to stand there?

22:42.418 --> 22:44.119
Anson will ruin
all of their lives.

22:44.187 --> 22:46.087
You of all people
can't let that happen.

22:46.155 --> 22:47.256
And if I don't do it,
you --

22:47.323 --> 22:49.058
I can handle myself,
Michael.

22:49.125 --> 22:50.292
I'm with Fi
on this one, Mike.

22:50.360 --> 22:51.694
The consequences
of helping Anson --

22:51.762 --> 22:54.597
The consequences are bad
no matter what I do!

22:54.665 --> 22:57.968
Now, I'm -- I'm trying to find
a way out of this.

22:58.035 --> 23:00.170
Mike, we <i>had</i> a way out of it.
It's gone!

23:00.238 --> 23:03.874
No!
We're not just giving up!

23:03.941 --> 23:06.209
Now, check
with your police buddy.

23:06.276 --> 23:08.778
See if they missed
something. Fi...

23:10.614 --> 23:12.482
...talk to one of
your black-market dealers.

23:12.550 --> 23:15.418
Michael...
We're running out of time.

23:15.486 --> 23:18.121
Those agents,

23:18.189 --> 23:21.158
Pearce --
they deserve better.

23:21.226 --> 23:23.494
And you deserve better
than a life in prison.

23:23.562 --> 23:25.829
We have one more day.

23:25.897 --> 23:29.367
Just -- just
a little while longer.

23:32.571 --> 23:35.339
Look, Mike, if we're gonna
pull off this op,

23:35.406 --> 23:36.607
we got to get going.

23:42.847 --> 23:44.447
Okay,
so talk me through this?

23:44.515 --> 23:46.716
First, we get to the airport,
break into the hangar,

23:46.784 --> 23:48.284
and get Jesse's gun
onto Reed's plane.

23:48.352 --> 23:49.452
Then I hook up with Reed.

23:49.519 --> 23:51.086
Security drops us off
around here.

23:51.154 --> 23:52.521
I get on the plane,
get the gun,

23:52.588 --> 23:53.955
take care of Reed's
personal bodyguard.

23:54.023 --> 23:56.057
Ryan, Nick, and I will
cover the tarmac with m4s

23:56.125 --> 23:57.558
while Rebecca
picks us up.

23:57.626 --> 23:59.861
We drive off, we hand over Reed
to the interrogators,

23:59.928 --> 24:01.295
and you go to work.

24:01.363 --> 24:03.364
Not bad. How are you planning
on getting into the hangar?

24:03.432 --> 24:04.933
You're gonna call
the TSA office,

24:05.001 --> 24:06.835
ask to check on the registration
on the plane.

24:06.903 --> 24:08.303
That should get
the security guards out

24:08.371 --> 24:09.371
for at least 10 minutes.

24:09.439 --> 24:10.806
I'll put it together
right away.

24:10.874 --> 24:14.410
And, uh, Michael,
remember -- this goes well,

24:14.478 --> 24:16.280
your future at the agency's
looking bright.

24:17.949 --> 24:21.118
I'll keep that in mind.

24:25.790 --> 24:27.557
<i>One of the most useful tools</i>

24:27.625 --> 24:30.326
<i>in domestic-intelligence</i>
<i>operations is local government.</i>

24:30.394 --> 24:31.927
<i>One call from the CIA,</i>

24:31.995 --> 24:34.129
<i>and most federal</i>
<i>and state agencies</i>

24:34.196 --> 24:36.397
<i>will help out if they can.</i>

24:36.465 --> 24:39.099
There we go.

24:39.167 --> 24:40.834
Reed's guys are gonna be
filling out forms

24:40.902 --> 24:42.569
for about 10 minutes.
You ready?

24:42.637 --> 24:44.371
Let's do it.

24:55.250 --> 24:57.652
Remember,
second seat on the left --

24:57.719 --> 24:59.754
under the cushion.
I got it, boss.

25:12.902 --> 25:14.737
How you doing out there,
Pearce?

25:14.805 --> 25:16.639
You're still...Clear.

25:16.707 --> 25:19.642
Make it fast.
You got a couple minutes, tops.

25:22.046 --> 25:24.047
We're good to go.

25:30.087 --> 25:33.188
Hey, uh,
just wanted to say thanks.

25:33.256 --> 25:34.456
For what?

25:34.524 --> 25:35.824
For not being a dick.

25:35.891 --> 25:38.026
I've worked with a lot
of field ops,

25:38.093 --> 25:39.527
and, uh, not all of them
are like you.

25:39.595 --> 25:41.328
It's good to have you back
with the agency.

25:41.396 --> 25:42.663
I'm just doing my best.

25:52.507 --> 25:54.642
We have eyes.

25:54.709 --> 25:57.444
All right.
Settle in and stay alert.

25:57.512 --> 25:59.646
We have three hours
before the target arrives.

25:59.714 --> 26:01.315
Three hours?

26:01.382 --> 26:03.117
I should have brought
a Sudoku.

26:03.184 --> 26:05.352
Who are you kidding, Ryan?
You can't spell "Sudoku,"

26:05.420 --> 26:06.554
much less play it.

26:06.621 --> 26:07.888
Guys,
stay off the radio

26:07.956 --> 26:10.825
unless it's mission-critical,
please. Thank you.

26:12.829 --> 26:15.630
Forgot how much running an op's
just babysitting, huh?

26:17.066 --> 26:19.501
So, how does it feel
to be back in the saddle?

26:19.569 --> 26:21.170
Not like I remember it.

26:26.108 --> 26:29.343
Listen, I'd help you
if I could, Sam.

26:29.411 --> 26:30.911
I just don't have
jurisdiction.

26:30.979 --> 26:32.346
Right, I get it --

26:32.414 --> 26:33.981
the warehouse explosion
was six counties away.

26:34.049 --> 26:35.916
But look, if you just ride up
there with us and talk to them.

26:35.984 --> 26:37.685
Those boys in Tampa
are like silverbacks

26:37.753 --> 26:39.186
when it comes
to their turf.

26:39.254 --> 26:41.355
They're never gonna let a Miami
badge near their crime scene.

26:41.423 --> 26:42.989
Tom, we're desperate here.
Please.

26:43.057 --> 26:45.492
Guys, I'm really sorry,
but I got to get to roll call.

26:45.560 --> 26:47.761
Okay. No problem.
Thanks.

26:47.829 --> 26:49.196
This is ridiculous.

26:49.264 --> 26:52.299
We have evidence that points
to Anson back at the loft.

26:52.366 --> 26:54.467
We're just wasting
our time.

26:54.535 --> 26:56.702
- To hell with this. I'm done.
- What -- hey, Fi.

26:56.770 --> 26:59.372
- I'm done!
- Fi, you can't just run off Willy-nilly.

26:59.439 --> 27:02.508
We promised Mike we'd talk to
the cops and work this through.

27:02.576 --> 27:04.010
Look,
we got to have a --

27:04.078 --> 27:05.679
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey.

27:05.746 --> 27:06.746
Open this door!

27:06.814 --> 27:08.381
What the hell
do you think --

27:08.449 --> 27:09.616
Fi!

27:09.683 --> 27:12.185
At least
leave me cab fare!

27:12.253 --> 27:13.386
Damn it.

27:18.326 --> 27:22.029
Ma, not the best time.

27:22.096 --> 27:23.263
Yeah, Mike.
Uh, we got to talk.

27:23.331 --> 27:24.965
Look,
I wouldn't be bugging you

27:25.032 --> 27:25.899
if this wasn't
a five-alarm fire.

27:25.966 --> 27:27.166
It's about Fi.

27:27.234 --> 27:29.935
Wait. W-what happened.
W-what's going on?

27:30.003 --> 27:30.936
Well, that's just it,
I don't know,

27:31.004 --> 27:32.271
but I know Fi, so...

27:32.338 --> 27:34.473
I'm kind of in the middle
of something, Ma.

27:34.541 --> 27:36.975
Mike, she ditched me in front
of the police station,

27:37.043 --> 27:38.610
went back to the loft.

27:38.677 --> 27:40.211
She was talking about the files
that we got, so believe me --

27:40.279 --> 27:42.981
this is one of those
"drop whatever you're doing

27:43.049 --> 27:44.549
right the hell now" situations!
- Uh-huh.

27:44.617 --> 27:46.852
Okay. A-all right.
I'm on my way.

27:46.919 --> 27:48.053
I'm on my <i>way.</i>

27:48.121 --> 27:49.488
I have to go.

27:49.556 --> 27:51.023
My mother, she's having
some sort of medical problem.

27:51.091 --> 27:53.526
Uh, Reed's gonna be here
in two hours.

27:53.593 --> 27:55.328
- I'll be back in an hour.
- Wait, Michael!

27:55.396 --> 27:57.998
Get back in here!
Mi--

28:06.575 --> 28:07.841
Sam called you.

28:07.909 --> 28:10.343
I knew I shouldn't have left him
with his phone.

28:10.411 --> 28:11.678
What are you doing, Fi?

28:13.915 --> 28:16.782
I saw Anson's warehouse.

28:16.850 --> 28:18.717
It was filled
with high explosives,

28:18.785 --> 28:20.753
over-pressured,
armor-piercing rounds...

28:20.820 --> 28:23.523
Nasty stuff.

28:23.590 --> 28:24.991
I understand that.

28:25.059 --> 28:26.426
Really?

28:26.494 --> 28:28.829
What do you think he has planned
after your little job,

28:28.897 --> 28:31.298
a picnic?

28:31.366 --> 28:34.469
No, he's gonna hurt more
people -- a <i>lot</i> more people.

28:34.536 --> 28:37.272
I just need a little more time
to find a way out of this.

28:37.340 --> 28:39.875
If I -- if I have
to plant this thing,

28:39.943 --> 28:43.580
if I have to burn them,
I will find a way to fix it.

28:43.647 --> 28:45.848
I've broken into
CIA computers before.

28:45.916 --> 28:48.651
I can do it again.
I will find a way.

28:48.719 --> 28:53.189
How many people will you destroy
if you can't?

28:57.027 --> 29:00.363
What do you want --
what do you want me to say, Fi?

29:00.431 --> 29:01.999
I'm doing this for you.

29:02.066 --> 29:03.534
Stop.

29:03.601 --> 29:06.771
Just stop.

29:06.838 --> 29:09.273
There has to be a line.

29:09.341 --> 29:12.076
There is no line
when it comes to you!

29:20.552 --> 29:22.653
I can't do this anymore.

29:25.124 --> 29:27.224
<i>We</i> can't do this.

29:29.461 --> 29:31.395
Let's just go.

29:31.463 --> 29:32.897
We'll go to Pearce.

29:32.964 --> 29:36.000
We'll talk to the FBI,
and we'll make them understand.

29:36.068 --> 29:37.969
They won't understand us.

29:38.036 --> 29:40.971
They won't understand.

29:42.841 --> 29:45.043
We start...

29:45.111 --> 29:46.978
down that road,
we can't come back.

29:47.046 --> 29:50.615
And I'll lose you.

29:50.683 --> 29:53.419
And I can't lose you.

30:03.096 --> 30:04.897
What are you doing?

30:06.699 --> 30:09.267
I'm buying time. I can't let
you do this -- not yet.

30:09.335 --> 30:11.536
Michael.

30:11.603 --> 30:13.704
I'm sorry, Fiona.

30:15.607 --> 30:16.807
Michael...

30:16.875 --> 30:18.542
Michael!!

30:18.610 --> 30:19.843
No! No!

30:19.911 --> 30:22.045
Michael! Michael!

30:42.353 --> 30:43.487
What do you want?

30:43.554 --> 30:45.388
Just checking up on you.

30:45.456 --> 30:47.790
Glad to see you made it back
to the party.

30:47.858 --> 30:49.960
You're here?

30:50.027 --> 30:51.728
Of course I'm here.

30:51.796 --> 30:54.265
You think
I'd miss the show?

30:54.333 --> 30:57.869
You plant that card
in Pearce's computer yet?

30:57.937 --> 31:00.306
Listen, Anson. You don't
need to burn these people.

31:00.374 --> 31:02.041
If you need a team,
take me instead.

31:02.109 --> 31:03.542
I appreciate your attempt

31:03.610 --> 31:05.811
to bargain with your fate
again, Michael,

31:05.879 --> 31:07.079
but that time is over.

31:07.147 --> 31:08.347
Cheer up.

31:08.415 --> 31:10.516
At the end of this,
you'll look like

31:10.583 --> 31:13.185
the only operative
who wasn't on the take.

31:13.253 --> 31:16.156
Michael Westen --
finally redeemed.

31:16.223 --> 31:18.658
You really expect
a "thank you"?

31:18.726 --> 31:20.527
I expect you
to get in that van

31:20.594 --> 31:23.429
and do what you came here
to do -- now.

31:30.003 --> 31:31.704
What'd I miss?

31:31.771 --> 31:33.872
Where the hell
have you been?

31:33.940 --> 31:35.674
I told you. I was --
I was with my mother.

31:35.742 --> 31:38.243
She was sick, but turns out,
it was a false alarm.

31:38.310 --> 31:39.410
I don't care <i>what</i> it is.

31:39.478 --> 31:40.878
You don't leave
for personal time

31:40.946 --> 31:42.180
in the middle
of an op again.

31:42.247 --> 31:43.848
Understood?

31:43.916 --> 31:46.885
Loud and clear.

31:46.952 --> 31:49.254
Reed's approaching
the first checkpoint.

31:49.321 --> 31:50.721
10 minutes to game time,
everybody.

31:50.789 --> 31:53.257
<i>In any operation,</i>

31:53.325 --> 31:56.727
<i>one of the toughest parts is</i>
<i>dealing with collateral damage.</i>

31:56.794 --> 31:58.162
Did Jesse make it
to the car?

31:58.229 --> 32:01.064
What -- you don't think
he made it in?

32:01.132 --> 32:05.102
Better safe than sorry.
I'm gonna check the flight plan.

32:07.005 --> 32:08.940
<i>When you're alone</i>
<i>in the field,</i>

32:09.007 --> 32:11.343
<i>you have to decide</i>
<i>whether to take actions</i>

32:11.410 --> 32:13.245
<i>that could hurt</i>
<i>innocent people,</i>

32:13.312 --> 32:14.813
<i>weighing the consequences</i>

32:14.881 --> 32:16.816
<i>against what happens</i>
<i>if you do nothing.</i>

32:18.719 --> 32:22.322
<i>And when you act --</i>
<i>when you take that step --</i>

32:22.389 --> 32:24.324
<i>you know that</i>
<i>whatever your reasons,</i>

32:24.392 --> 32:25.926
<i>whatever the costs or benefits,</i>

32:25.993 --> 32:27.827
<i>you have done</i>
<i>something terrible.</i>

32:27.895 --> 32:29.329
No, he's in there.

32:31.799 --> 32:33.232
You can get in position.

32:38.505 --> 32:40.840
<i>And when it's done,</i>

32:40.908 --> 32:43.342
<i>all you can do then is</i>
<i>carry on with the operation,</i>

32:43.410 --> 32:45.478
<i>knowing that it's your job</i>
<i>to repair the hurt</i>

32:45.545 --> 32:47.179
<i>you're about to cause</i>

32:47.247 --> 32:51.517
<i>and the damage you're about</i>
<i>to do -- or die trying.</i>

32:55.188 --> 32:58.257
Hey.
Hey.

32:58.324 --> 33:03.162
Your friend Jesse --
brave guy.

33:03.229 --> 33:05.264
Yeah, he is.

33:05.332 --> 33:06.566
Well,
don't worry about it.

33:06.634 --> 33:07.700
We're gonna get him out of here
in one piece.

33:10.337 --> 33:11.638
Huh.

33:11.706 --> 33:13.707
What is it?

33:13.775 --> 33:17.078
Rebecca's now carrying
a .380 auto.

33:17.146 --> 33:20.549
Kind of an unusual gun for
this kind of operation, isn't it?

33:20.616 --> 33:21.983
She makes up for it,
though.

33:22.051 --> 33:23.251
She carries two clips

33:23.319 --> 33:25.120
of over-pressured,
teflon-coated rounds.

33:25.187 --> 33:27.956
Did you say
over-pressured rounds?

33:28.024 --> 33:29.224
Yeah.

33:34.897 --> 33:37.064
You don't do anything
until I tell you.

33:37.132 --> 33:38.265
I got to check
on something.

33:38.333 --> 33:39.433
A-are you sure?
We don't have much time.

33:39.501 --> 33:43.204
You stand down until I say!
Are we clear?

33:43.272 --> 33:44.572
We're clear.

34:02.526 --> 34:04.760
Wow.

34:04.828 --> 34:07.462
Anson warned me you were good.
I guess he was right.

34:07.530 --> 34:10.732
You were working with Anson
the whole time.

34:10.800 --> 34:13.568
You sabotaged
that first operation.

34:13.636 --> 34:16.737
And it's <i>your</i> ammunition
in Anson's warehouse.

34:16.804 --> 34:18.172
You know how Anson is.

34:18.239 --> 34:20.574
Once he gets his claws in you,
that's it.

34:20.641 --> 34:22.007
And this?

34:22.076 --> 34:24.578
You were gonna blow up
the plane, Reed, and Jesse.

34:24.646 --> 34:26.580
Anson knows you, Michael.

34:26.648 --> 34:28.681
He knew you'd play along,

34:28.748 --> 34:30.483
plant that card
in Pearce's computer,

34:30.551 --> 34:32.252
then find some way
to undo the damage.

34:32.320 --> 34:34.621
Couple of corpses
make that a lot harder.

34:34.688 --> 34:36.556
I <i>am</i> gonna need
that detonator back.

34:36.623 --> 34:37.658
No, I can't do that.

34:37.725 --> 34:39.092
I'm not asking --
I'm telling.

34:39.159 --> 34:40.260
You shoot me,

34:40.328 --> 34:41.561
the others will hear
the shot,

34:41.629 --> 34:42.728
and they will
come after you.

34:42.797 --> 34:43.929
You shoot me,

34:43.998 --> 34:45.966
the whole op goes south
and Jesse dies.

34:46.033 --> 34:48.634
It's not too late to change
your mind, Michael.

34:48.702 --> 34:51.303
You and I both know
Anson's watching right now.

34:51.371 --> 34:53.405
Yeah, I'm sorry
to disappoint him,

34:53.473 --> 34:55.672
but I'm not going
to let you kill me.

34:55.741 --> 34:57.708
It's time for you
to leave.

34:57.776 --> 35:00.644
I hope your friend Jesse
enjoys his flight

35:00.712 --> 35:02.112
to the badlands
of Liberia.

35:02.180 --> 35:04.114
I'm sure Reed will be
pretty pissed off

35:04.182 --> 35:05.616
when he finds out
he was lying.

35:07.853 --> 35:09.753
<i>When an operation goes bad,</i>

35:09.821 --> 35:11.922
<i>you don't get much time</i>
<i>to decide what to do.</i>

35:11.990 --> 35:14.925
<i>It's just a matter of facing</i>
<i>the consequences</i>

35:14.993 --> 35:17.393
<i>of immediate failure</i>
<i>or the risks</i>

35:17.461 --> 35:20.797
<i>of trying to save the operation</i>
<i>on the fly.</i>

35:20.865 --> 35:22.199
Everyone listen carefully.

35:22.267 --> 35:24.268
Things have changed.
There is a new plan.

35:24.336 --> 35:26.103
Michael!
What is going on out there?

35:26.171 --> 35:28.139
I just saw Rebecca leave
in the escape car.

35:28.207 --> 35:29.274
Rebecca was a plant.

35:29.342 --> 35:31.076
She was here to sabotage
the mission.

35:31.144 --> 35:33.111
We need to kill
her radio now.

35:33.179 --> 35:34.680
Michael, Reed is here.

35:34.747 --> 35:36.549
If something's happened,
you need to tell me.

35:36.617 --> 35:37.383
There is no time!

35:37.451 --> 35:38.784
What you need to know now

35:38.852 --> 35:40.654
is that Jesse cannot
get on that plane.

35:40.721 --> 35:42.155
I'll get him out of there,

35:42.223 --> 35:43.723
but I need you to lay down
covering fire on my signal.

35:43.791 --> 35:46.392
Covering fire?
Are you insane?

35:46.460 --> 35:48.227
Please.
There is no time.

35:48.295 --> 35:50.296
If we don't do this,
Jesse dies.

35:50.363 --> 35:52.932
What's the signal?

35:53.000 --> 35:54.366
When the plane explodes.

35:54.434 --> 35:57.503
Damn it, Westen.

35:59.639 --> 36:01.874
They're out of the car.

36:01.942 --> 36:04.277
Where are we shooting
when this party starts?

36:04.345 --> 36:05.545
Focus on the vehicles.

36:05.612 --> 36:07.947
Make sure the security
can't leave.

36:08.015 --> 36:09.949
I will take care of the rest.

36:12.853 --> 36:16.555
All we got's a couple pilots?
No flight attendants?

36:16.623 --> 36:21.327
I mean, I was -- I was hoping
for a G-VI, G-IV at least.

36:21.395 --> 36:23.529
Small planes get
less scrutiny at the airports.

36:23.597 --> 36:25.831
I thought you were concerned
about security, Mr. Porter.

36:25.899 --> 36:28.100
I'm just saying don't cheap out
on me, all right?

36:28.168 --> 36:29.468
Oh, you'll get
your money.

36:29.536 --> 36:32.004
Believe me.
You'll get your money.

36:41.047 --> 36:42.347
Let's do this!

36:52.425 --> 36:53.759
What the hell
is happening?!

36:53.827 --> 36:55.428
I have no idea, man.
I have no idea.

36:59.579 --> 37:00.646
Who is shooting at us?!

37:00.714 --> 37:02.381
Stay down. Stay down.

37:25.204 --> 37:27.639
- Get in the car!
- I can get you out of here!

37:27.707 --> 37:28.974
Sir, the airport
security's here.

37:29.041 --> 37:30.041
Go now! Go!
We'll cover you!

37:32.011 --> 37:34.614
Get me out of here!

37:41.389 --> 37:42.855
They're in the car!
They're away! They're away!

37:53.499 --> 37:54.900
Why are we stopping?

37:54.967 --> 37:56.735
Wait a minute.
You're not airport security.

37:56.802 --> 37:58.870
What the hell is going on?
What happened back there?

37:58.938 --> 38:00.304
- I have no idea.
- I have no idea.

38:00.372 --> 38:01.939
I don't know what the hell
you think you're doing,

38:02.007 --> 38:03.174
but you obviously
don't know who I am.

38:03.242 --> 38:04.075
What I can do to you --

38:07.714 --> 38:08.980
Mike, at the risk of getting
a beat-down,

38:09.048 --> 38:10.048
can you tell <i>me</i>
<i>what the hell's going on?</i>

38:10.116 --> 38:11.016
It was a set-up.

38:11.084 --> 38:12.484
Rebecca was a plant.

38:12.552 --> 38:14.086
Anson wasn't just planning
on getting the team burned

38:14.154 --> 38:15.488
for stealing money.

38:15.556 --> 38:16.856
He was going to get them burned
for killing you.

38:16.924 --> 38:18.158
Okay, wait, wait.
What?

38:18.225 --> 38:19.726
There's no time for the details
right now.

38:19.794 --> 38:21.094
I need you
to do two things --

38:21.162 --> 38:22.462
deliver this son of a bitch
to Pearce

38:22.530 --> 38:23.763
and destroy her laptop.

38:23.831 --> 38:25.398
Nobody's getting burned today.
You got it?

38:25.466 --> 38:26.413
What about Fi?

38:26.414 --> 38:27.714
Anson's gonna use everything
he's got against her.

38:27.739 --> 38:28.939
I know!

38:41.880 --> 38:43.915
Fi, we got to leave.
We got --

38:43.983 --> 38:47.353
Sam! Sam, what happened?
Where's Fi?

38:47.420 --> 38:49.622
Mike...
I came back.

38:49.690 --> 38:51.691
I saw what you did
with Fi.

38:51.759 --> 38:53.527
She wanted to call you.
She begged me.

38:53.594 --> 38:55.695
Said she just wanted to use
the phone for a minute.

38:55.763 --> 38:57.831
Eventually, I gave in

38:57.899 --> 38:59.433
and took her purse
over to her,

38:59.501 --> 39:01.369
and she --
she clocked me with a bottle.

39:01.436 --> 39:03.971
- Her lock picks.
- Yeah.

39:04.039 --> 39:05.839
They were in her purse.

39:07.341 --> 39:09.309
I came to, the cuffs
were off her and on me,

39:09.377 --> 39:11.812
and she was
halfway out the door.

39:11.880 --> 39:14.014
She said she was sorry.
Mike --

39:14.082 --> 39:15.649
- She's turning herself in?
- Yeah.

39:15.717 --> 39:16.917
Federal building.

39:16.985 --> 39:18.585
She said
she didn't want to let you

39:18.653 --> 39:20.253
keep working
for Anson anymore,

39:20.321 --> 39:23.223
and she didn't want to run
and let the bastard get away.

39:23.290 --> 39:25.391
She said this is
the only way to end it.

39:27.060 --> 39:29.562
She left that
for you, Mike.

39:29.630 --> 39:32.466
I'm sorry, Mikey.

39:33.901 --> 39:36.035
I'm so sorry.

39:39.778 --> 39:42.312
What do you want?

39:42.380 --> 39:45.381
Michael, that was quite
a disaster at the airport today.

39:45.449 --> 39:47.284
I thought we had
an understanding.

39:47.351 --> 39:48.919
So did I. You lied to me.

39:48.986 --> 39:50.787
I told you
what you wanted to hear.

39:50.855 --> 39:54.190
I also told you what would
happen if things didn't go well.

39:57.595 --> 40:01.098
Well, it's over.
One way or another, it's over.

40:01.165 --> 40:02.399
I'll see you in hell.

40:28.860 --> 40:29.927
Fi!

40:38.402 --> 40:40.304
Fiona!

40:45.076 --> 40:47.178
Fi!

40:52.050 --> 40:53.217
Fi!

40:55.921 --> 40:59.357
Fiona Glenanne?

40:59.424 --> 41:01.659
Yes.

41:01.727 --> 41:03.761
I'm here to,
uh, surrender.

41:03.829 --> 41:06.530
Hands up! Hands up!
Back of your head now!

41:06.598 --> 41:09.166
Do it now! Turn around!
Turn around!

41:23.615 --> 41:28.018
"Even before I knew
your real name, I loved you.

41:28.086 --> 41:30.254
"Before I should have,
I trusted you.

41:30.321 --> 41:33.757
"Because I've always known
your heart.

41:33.824 --> 41:36.893
You do what's right,
no matter the cost to you."

41:38.663 --> 41:42.165
"And I've learned
that when you love a spy,

41:42.233 --> 41:45.969
"you have to be willing
to make that sacrifice, too.

41:46.036 --> 41:48.771
"At times, your job has made it
hard to be with you,

41:48.839 --> 41:50.973
but it's never shaken
my faith in you."

41:52.076 --> 41:54.977
"I can't let you ruin
anyone's life to save mine.

41:55.045 --> 41:57.146
"I have to force you
to tell what you know.

41:57.213 --> 42:00.882
"If you don't,
you won't be the man I love.

42:00.950 --> 42:02.850
"Do the right thing.

42:02.918 --> 42:05.987
I love you, Michael."

42:07.457 --> 42:09.124
"Forever."
