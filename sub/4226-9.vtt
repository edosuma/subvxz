00:35.110 --> 00:37.111
I'm sorry, Tom.

00:37.146 --> 00:39.213
I didn't know how else
to explain it.

00:39.247 --> 00:42.181
The Skitters
were harnessed, too.

00:47.319 --> 00:49.187
I don't know why,
but I just assumed

00:49.221 --> 00:51.356
that Ben would be okay
when we got him back.

00:51.391 --> 00:53.126
Well, Tom,
he is healthy,

00:53.160 --> 00:55.661
and he seems to be
adjusting emotionally.

00:55.695 --> 00:57.964
Those needles in his back
aren't going away, though,

00:57.998 --> 00:59.633
like with the other kids.

00:59.667 --> 01:04.004
Well, Ben and Rick were taken
months before the others.

01:04.039 --> 01:05.740
That doesn't explain
that patch of skin

01:05.774 --> 01:07.675
that you found on his back
that was rough like this.

01:07.710 --> 01:10.512
It <i>is</i> similar.

01:10.547 --> 01:14.217
It wasn't enough that they
take him away from me once.

01:17.021 --> 01:19.156
They're still trying.

01:25.130 --> 01:28.232
<i>Who turned out the lights?</i>
<i>I can't see a thing!</i>

01:48.153 --> 01:49.821
Weaver wants you
in the C.P.

01:49.855 --> 01:51.188
All right,
I'll be right there.

01:57.662 --> 01:59.095
We don't want anybody
caught up in here.

01:59.130 --> 02:00.597
This is a hot spot
right here.

02:00.631 --> 02:02.131
I'm very clear about this
being the one way --

02:02.165 --> 02:03.599
Captain.

02:03.633 --> 02:05.234
Sounds like Scott's throwing
one hell of a party.

02:05.268 --> 02:06.969
Well, we've been working
them pretty hard.

02:07.003 --> 02:08.235
I think they were ready
to blow off a little steam.

02:08.270 --> 02:09.905
Don't let it
go on too long.

02:09.939 --> 02:11.773
I want these people
sharp as razors by tomorrow.

02:11.808 --> 02:14.076
They'll be ready.
No word yet from Dai.

02:14.111 --> 02:16.612
He should be back from Porter's
headquarters anytime.

02:16.646 --> 02:18.594
Any last-minute changes,
I'd like to run them past

02:18.619 --> 02:19.682
the squad leaders tonight.

02:19.683 --> 02:21.250
Lieutenant Danner's
already on it.

02:21.285 --> 02:23.219
I told them
to expect adjustments.

02:23.253 --> 02:24.754
Whatever the word,
we'll be good to go.

02:24.789 --> 02:26.122
Get the duty rosters.

02:26.156 --> 02:28.291
I want to go over the field
assignments one more time.

02:28.326 --> 02:30.727
We don't hear from Porter,
we have a problem.

02:30.761 --> 02:33.330
How you holding up?

02:33.364 --> 02:35.298
I'm fine.

02:35.333 --> 02:38.134
After what happened in Allston,
you know why I'm asking.

02:38.168 --> 02:41.103
And I just told you --
let it go.

02:43.206 --> 02:45.173
There's a problem
right here.

02:45.208 --> 02:49.310
Well, you see, I'm not sure
about these guys here.

02:53.916 --> 02:55.984
Heads up, guys!

02:57.921 --> 03:00.122
Go, go, go!

03:01.992 --> 03:02.992
It's Dai!

03:05.996 --> 03:08.631
He's been hit!

03:08.665 --> 03:11.000
Stay here!

03:17.574 --> 03:18.741
Captain, Dai's back, sir!

03:18.775 --> 03:20.876
He's wounded really bad!
Please come!

03:22.211 --> 03:24.179
Tom, get Anne! Tell her
to meet us at the clinic.

03:24.213 --> 03:26.748
- Lieutenant Danner, with me!
- On it.

03:38.729 --> 03:40.896
He has
a deep abdominal laceration

03:40.931 --> 03:42.231
but no internal damage.

03:42.266 --> 03:43.833
Is he gonna make it?

03:43.867 --> 03:45.802
Well, he's unconscious,
and he's lost a lot of blood.

03:45.836 --> 03:47.537
I'll have a better idea
by morning.

03:47.572 --> 03:48.839
Did he give you
his report?

03:48.873 --> 03:51.908
Just take care
of him.

03:51.943 --> 03:54.344
Five minutes, C.P.

03:58.982 --> 04:01.850
Lieutenant Danner's
moving up the food chain.

04:01.885 --> 04:04.052
I hear
he's career military.

04:04.086 --> 04:06.221
Yeah. He was
one of the lucky ones.

04:06.255 --> 04:08.756
He was on leave at Fort Drum
when it got hit.

04:08.791 --> 04:10.992
I guess Weaver wanted somebody
with hard combat experience

04:11.026 --> 04:12.794
to help him
with the planning.

04:12.828 --> 04:14.262
What's going on
between you and Weaver?

04:14.297 --> 04:15.730
It's complicated.

04:15.765 --> 04:17.732
I can handle complicated.

04:21.303 --> 04:24.606
There was a little incident
on our last scout.

04:24.640 --> 04:26.908
I wouldn't call it
a nervous breakdown --

04:26.942 --> 04:29.678
more like a guy being pushed
too close to the edge --

04:29.712 --> 04:31.847
but Weaver almost
didn't make it back.

04:31.881 --> 04:34.583
- Oh. That serious?
- Yeah.

04:34.617 --> 04:36.318
Does anybody else know?

04:36.352 --> 04:38.154
No. Only Hal.

04:38.188 --> 04:40.823
Once we got back, he kind of
seemed to snap out of it,

04:40.857 --> 04:42.091
so, for the sake of morale,

04:42.125 --> 04:44.127
we decided to keep
what happened between us.

04:44.161 --> 04:45.895
And now?

04:45.929 --> 04:48.131
I'm not so sure that
was the right decision.

04:48.166 --> 04:50.567
- Tom, this attack's in two days.
- I know.

04:50.601 --> 04:53.269
And the last thing people need
is me raising doubts.

04:53.303 --> 04:56.805
What are you gonna do?

04:56.840 --> 04:59.007
I wish I knew.

05:06.147 --> 05:09.916
Let's be clear.
Nothing has changed.

05:09.950 --> 05:12.185
We'll be following
Porter's original plan.

05:12.220 --> 05:14.587
4th and 5th
will bring explosives

05:14.622 --> 05:17.157
from here,
here, and here.

05:17.191 --> 05:19.025
2nd Mass
will come from the west.

05:19.060 --> 05:21.528
So we got confirmation
from Porter, then --

05:21.562 --> 05:23.196
the 4th and 5th
are still active.

05:23.231 --> 05:25.365
The man just said
the mission is a go.

05:25.400 --> 05:26.767
Not what I asked.

05:26.801 --> 05:28.969
This isn't some
classroom Q&A, Mason.

05:29.003 --> 05:32.139
That's enough, Danner.
Give us the room.

05:39.949 --> 05:41.316
Is this your idea
of leadership --

05:41.350 --> 05:43.618
second-guessing me
in front of my fighters?

05:43.652 --> 05:46.554
I'm just asking questions
that should have easy answers.

05:46.589 --> 05:48.623
Last I heard, we'd lost contact
with the 4th and 5th,

05:48.657 --> 05:50.692
and since I wasn't there
for Dai's report --

05:50.726 --> 05:52.160
That's right.
You weren't.

05:52.195 --> 05:54.196
I'm satisfied that this mission
can be completed,

05:54.230 --> 05:57.199
and a combat briefing
isn't a debate club.

05:57.234 --> 05:59.202
When Porter made me
second in command,

05:59.236 --> 06:00.636
I expected to be kept
in the loop.

06:00.671 --> 06:02.505
Or what --
you're gonna run your mouth

06:02.540 --> 06:04.207
about what happened
on that scout?

06:04.241 --> 06:06.476
No. But maybe we should talk
about that.

06:06.511 --> 06:08.211
A few hours ago,
you were swigging whiskey

06:08.246 --> 06:09.979
and talking like
a borderline suicide.

06:10.014 --> 06:12.449
- I told you what that was about.
- And I accepted it.

06:12.483 --> 06:14.550
But there's no room for error
on this mission.

06:14.585 --> 06:17.620
And the only way
it can be successful

06:17.655 --> 06:20.757
is if the fighters have
absolute confidence

06:20.791 --> 06:22.091
in their
commanding officer.

06:22.125 --> 06:23.726
If you want to be
in the loop,

06:23.760 --> 06:25.360
I need to know
you got my back.

06:27.130 --> 06:28.797
All right.

06:28.831 --> 06:30.833
Good.

06:30.867 --> 06:33.169
Danner, get in here!

06:36.540 --> 06:39.042
I want you to start allocating Pope's
Mech ammunition to the fighters.

06:39.076 --> 06:41.645
And I want you and Hal
to set up an observation post

06:41.679 --> 06:43.614
five miles out
on Highway 4.

06:43.649 --> 06:45.684
You're putting me
on sentry duty.

06:45.718 --> 06:46.851
I need eyeballs out there

06:46.886 --> 06:48.954
in case the Skitters
decide to make a move,

06:48.988 --> 06:50.956
and all my other fighters
are assigned

06:50.991 --> 06:53.792
to upgrading weapons
and vehicles.

06:53.827 --> 06:56.195
But if it's a problem,
I can relieve you,

06:56.229 --> 06:57.997
and Danner
can pick up the slack.

06:58.031 --> 06:59.131
Your choice.

06:59.165 --> 07:00.232
First light.

07:00.266 --> 07:02.234
Dismissed.

07:26.894 --> 07:28.061
Tom.

07:28.095 --> 07:30.630
Kicked his blankets off.

07:30.664 --> 07:32.331
He's been doing that
since he was a little kid.

07:35.369 --> 07:37.136
I need to talk to you.

07:42.743 --> 07:47.180
Lourdes, tell Tom
what you told me.

07:47.215 --> 07:48.915
Uh, it's Captain Weaver.

07:48.950 --> 07:51.919
I heard what you were saying
about him earlier, and...

07:51.953 --> 07:54.088
He came to me
a couple weeks ago

07:54.122 --> 07:56.257
and asked me to help him
with some medications.

07:56.292 --> 07:58.293
Prescribed by your old friend
Dr. Harris.

07:58.327 --> 07:59.828
Yeah,
he said he came to me

07:59.862 --> 08:01.797
because he didn't want
to bother Dr. Glass.

08:01.831 --> 08:03.132
And because he knew
I'd ask questions.

08:03.167 --> 08:05.602
Okay.
What kind of medications?

08:05.636 --> 08:08.672
Phenobarbital to sleep
and amphetamines to wake up.

08:08.707 --> 08:10.674
It's a classic
addictive cycle.

08:10.709 --> 08:12.776
And once you start,
it's hard to stop.

08:12.810 --> 08:15.812
What would that --
what would that do to him?

08:15.847 --> 08:17.147
Depends how many
he's taking --

08:17.182 --> 08:18.682
one or two a day,
probably nothing.

08:18.717 --> 08:19.817
And more?

08:19.851 --> 08:21.752
The symptoms
could be extreme --

08:21.786 --> 08:24.188
paranoia, mood swings,
even hallucinations.

08:24.222 --> 08:25.923
Tom, if Weaver's
abusing these drugs,

08:25.957 --> 08:27.792
there's a good chance
that what you saw in Boston --

08:27.826 --> 08:28.893
that could happen again.

08:36.385 --> 08:37.424
I can't believe this.

08:37.480 --> 08:39.410
For all we know, he could have
been dosing himself for weeks.

08:39.412 --> 08:42.100
That was before.
Now we need to focus on today.

08:42.101 --> 08:43.434
So, what are we gonna do?

08:43.469 --> 08:45.103
First, you're gonna
follow orders.

08:45.138 --> 08:46.538
And go on
that sentry mission?

08:46.572 --> 08:47.706
Mm-hmm.

08:47.740 --> 08:48.840
There's no way
I'm gonna leave you here

08:48.874 --> 08:50.007
to deal with Weaver
by yourself.

08:50.042 --> 08:51.809
This isn't just about him.

08:51.844 --> 08:54.645
Dad, he's setting us up
for the mother of all battles.

08:54.679 --> 08:57.414
If he's not 100%,
he's gonna get us all killed.

08:57.448 --> 08:59.883
And if I accuse him...

08:59.917 --> 09:02.318
of being unfit for duty
without all the facts,

09:02.353 --> 09:04.254
it's gonna tear
the 2nd Mass apart.

09:04.288 --> 09:06.656
- What more do you need to know?
- More.

09:07.959 --> 09:09.492
Do you remember
what it was like

09:09.527 --> 09:10.960
before Porter
brought us together?

09:10.995 --> 09:14.130
Everybody on their own,
scrounging for food and water.

09:14.165 --> 09:15.799
Forget about fighting back.

09:15.833 --> 09:17.968
It was all
we could do to survive.

09:18.003 --> 09:21.905
Soldiers like Weaver are a big
part of what got us this far.

09:21.940 --> 09:23.540
You're defending him.

09:23.575 --> 09:25.109
No, I'm just saying that,

09:25.143 --> 09:28.412
unless we stick together and
fight the aliens as a group...

09:28.446 --> 09:29.647
We're as good as dead.

09:29.681 --> 09:31.315
And until I talk to him,

09:31.349 --> 09:33.817
we're gonna proceed as if
this mission is still a go.

09:33.851 --> 09:35.051
All right, fine.

09:35.086 --> 09:38.121
You stay here.
I'll go on the mission.

09:38.156 --> 09:39.957
But I need another rider.

09:39.991 --> 09:42.292
You have anybody
in mind?

09:43.661 --> 09:45.428
Yeah.

09:45.463 --> 09:47.397
He asked.
I volunteered.

09:47.431 --> 09:50.967
The no-questions-asked part
intrigued me.

09:51.002 --> 09:52.702
And you're sure
about this?

09:52.736 --> 09:54.570
I don't see
any other way.

09:55.772 --> 09:57.272
Be careful.

10:08.617 --> 10:12.721
That's it!
Keep moving.

10:12.755 --> 10:16.491
Imagine those Mechs
roaring in on you!

10:16.525 --> 10:17.959
How much fun
you're gonna have

10:17.994 --> 10:20.863
shooting them
with their own toys.

10:20.897 --> 10:22.631
What?

10:22.666 --> 10:25.634
Two arms, two legs,
no brains.

10:25.668 --> 10:27.803
Welcome to
the 2nd Massachusetts.

10:27.837 --> 10:30.405
You want to try that again,
convict?

10:30.440 --> 10:33.408
You didn't crimp it.

10:33.443 --> 10:37.512
Gravity. Newton. Apple tree.
Do it again.

10:37.547 --> 10:38.914
No, no, no,
kid, look,

10:38.948 --> 10:40.582
you don't need to polish it
to a shine like that.

10:40.617 --> 10:44.086
When it comes to Mech ammo,
it's quantity, not quality.

10:44.120 --> 10:47.357
Sure your old man
was talking about me?

10:47.391 --> 10:50.126
- He said, "Stay away from pope."
- Great.

10:50.160 --> 10:52.895
So suddenly I'm the beneficiary of
some preadolescent rebellious streak.

10:52.929 --> 10:55.731
He keeps treating me
like this little kid,

10:55.765 --> 10:57.800
like I can't
do anything.

10:57.834 --> 10:59.768
But I want
to help, too.

11:01.003 --> 11:03.171
Besides, I <i>am</i> staying away
from you,

11:03.205 --> 11:04.739
just not that far.

11:04.774 --> 11:07.141
Sound like one of my attorneys.

11:07.175 --> 11:09.009
Ah.

11:09.044 --> 11:10.844
I guess...
What's the big deal?

11:10.879 --> 11:13.547
I mean...It's not like
your pops is gonna do anything

11:13.582 --> 11:16.683
to the little prince of the 2nd Mass.
I'm not a prince!

11:18.052 --> 11:19.786
You're not the only one.

11:19.821 --> 11:22.455
There's two other
little princelets.

11:22.490 --> 11:25.525
But you're the youngest.
That makes you special.

11:25.559 --> 11:28.462
So, what's it like, huh,
walking around

11:28.496 --> 11:30.331
with that
sweet Mason brand?

11:30.365 --> 11:32.800
What's it like having hair
like a girl?

11:42.146 --> 11:44.881
We're gonna have to work
on your insults, kid.

11:44.915 --> 11:47.617
Come on.
<i>Ándale! Ándale!</i>

11:47.651 --> 11:50.954
12 hours --
just half a day!

11:50.988 --> 11:53.456
I need 16 soldiers
advancing towards the south

11:53.490 --> 11:55.759
while we rendezvous
at the Alpha point here.

11:55.793 --> 11:58.629
Now, if there's no contact
from the 3rd and 4th,

11:58.663 --> 12:00.397
fall back to plan "B."

12:01.532 --> 12:03.434
Meet in the southwest --
Captain.

12:03.468 --> 12:07.071
I'd like a word
in private.

12:07.105 --> 12:11.175
I told you to set up an O.P.
at the five-mile line.

12:11.209 --> 12:12.643
What are you doing here?

12:12.677 --> 12:15.446
I sent Hal and Margaret.
They can get it done.

12:15.481 --> 12:16.815
That's not your call.

12:16.849 --> 12:18.917
I give you an order,
I expect it to be followed out.

12:18.952 --> 12:21.019
Captain, I'd like
a word in private.

12:35.200 --> 12:38.468
I know about the pills.

12:38.503 --> 12:40.337
I'd like to know how many
of those you're taking.

12:40.371 --> 12:41.971
We don't have time
for this.

12:42.006 --> 12:45.708
We are one day away from kicking
these aliens in their teeth.

12:45.743 --> 12:48.045
And you're
shutting me out,

12:48.079 --> 12:50.948
sending me off
on a sentry-post duty.

12:50.982 --> 12:52.750
Now, if you're holding
something back...

12:52.784 --> 12:53.952
What are you gonna do?

12:53.986 --> 12:55.954
You gonna relieve me
of my command?

12:55.988 --> 12:59.024
I'd hope you'd do the right
thing for the 2nd Mass

12:59.058 --> 13:00.492
before it came to that.

13:00.527 --> 13:02.628
You've been wanting
to take over this outfit

13:02.662 --> 13:04.363
ever since Porter first
gave you a commission.

13:04.398 --> 13:05.531
That's not true.

13:05.566 --> 13:07.733
You're questioning
my strategy...

13:07.768 --> 13:09.102
ignoring a direct order.

13:09.136 --> 13:11.404
That is
rank insubordination.

13:11.438 --> 13:13.806
Danner and Jimmy!

13:13.841 --> 13:16.342
I'm asking you...

13:16.376 --> 13:18.044
Consider the lives
of your fighters.

13:18.078 --> 13:20.146
That's all
I am considering.

13:20.180 --> 13:21.747
Jimmy, get the door.

13:25.653 --> 13:28.555
Lieutenant Danner,
secure Tom's weapons.

13:28.589 --> 13:30.924
Don't do it.
Captain.

13:30.959 --> 13:32.593
Lieutenant Danner.
Don't do it.

13:32.627 --> 13:35.595
- Put them on the deck, please.
- Don't do this.

13:40.035 --> 13:41.802
Hold him
in the boiler room

13:41.837 --> 13:43.070
till I tell you otherwise.

13:43.105 --> 13:44.171
Yes, sir.

13:45.707 --> 13:46.841
It's a mistake.

13:46.875 --> 13:48.108
The only mistake
I can see

13:48.143 --> 13:49.876
is not removing you
from duty sooner.

13:49.911 --> 13:51.478
You're making a mistake.

13:51.512 --> 13:53.947
These people
are depending on you.

13:58.953 --> 14:01.021
Captain.

14:01.055 --> 14:02.589
I don't like it, Jimmy.

14:02.624 --> 14:05.359
But we can't let Mason
poison the ranks,

14:05.393 --> 14:08.763
not when we're hours away
from a major offensive.

14:11.733 --> 14:13.968
I hope I can count
on you, Jimmy.

14:21.610 --> 14:26.014
Ben, did your father send you
over to give me a hand?

14:26.048 --> 14:28.717
Actually, they moved some
of the library books in here.

14:28.751 --> 14:30.385
Ah. Right.

14:30.420 --> 14:32.955
Sorry. I thought Matt
was helping you.

14:32.990 --> 14:35.692
Oh, it seems I'm missing
my young assistant

14:35.726 --> 14:37.828
to the dubious charms
of Mr. Pope.

14:37.862 --> 14:40.664
Then maybe
I <i>can</i> do something.

14:40.699 --> 14:43.434
The way everyone's gearing up,
feels like I should help.

14:43.469 --> 14:46.737
That's the best offer
I've had today.

14:46.771 --> 14:47.971
Why don't you
grab this box

14:48.006 --> 14:50.073
and follow me over
to the desk, huh?

14:51.743 --> 14:53.277
What are these?

14:54.012 --> 14:55.846
Huh?

14:55.881 --> 14:58.983
Oh, they're, uh --
they're vacuum tubes.

14:59.018 --> 15:00.819
You know, if transistors
were the Ferarris

15:00.853 --> 15:04.556
of the electronic age,
this is the Model T.

15:04.590 --> 15:05.924
Hmm. What's a Model T?

15:07.126 --> 15:09.494
Well, a-all you
really need to know

15:09.528 --> 15:12.764
is that this transmitter here
needs them in order to operate,

15:12.798 --> 15:15.734
and I'm looking
for a very specific one.

15:15.768 --> 15:17.135
Once you get it working,

15:17.170 --> 15:18.937
are you gonna try and contact
other people?

15:18.971 --> 15:20.639
Well, that was one idea.

15:20.673 --> 15:22.841
What if the Skitters
hear you?

15:22.875 --> 15:25.444
Won't they be able
to find us?

15:25.478 --> 15:27.846
Aha! Found it.

15:27.881 --> 15:30.382
I've got this idea
about the Skitters.

15:30.417 --> 15:32.952
We know that they communicate
with each other

15:32.986 --> 15:34.453
using radio frequencies.

15:34.487 --> 15:36.055
Find the right frequency,

15:36.089 --> 15:37.823
and we can jam up
their communications.

15:37.858 --> 15:40.693
Certainly throw a wrench
into their plans, huh?

15:40.727 --> 15:42.862
Okay, here we go.

15:42.896 --> 15:44.663
There. Good.

15:44.697 --> 15:47.132
Okay, now let's see

15:47.166 --> 15:50.034
if we can get this thing
to send out a signal.

15:50.069 --> 15:52.637
Can you just crank the handle
on that radio?

15:52.671 --> 15:54.572
Yeah, okay.
Yeah, right there.

15:54.606 --> 15:57.107
And I will roll through
the frequencies.

16:02.179 --> 16:04.013
Okay.

16:04.047 --> 16:05.548
How's...

16:05.582 --> 16:07.150
How's that?

16:10.888 --> 16:12.522
Anything yet?

16:15.760 --> 16:17.928
Oh.

16:17.962 --> 16:19.829
W-what happened?

16:19.864 --> 16:21.765
Is everything all right?

16:21.800 --> 16:23.467
Yeah. It's all right.

16:23.501 --> 16:25.770
It's all right.
I'm fine.

16:25.804 --> 16:30.007
Well, that's more than I can say
for this bucket of bolts.

16:30.042 --> 16:33.445
So you're sure the radio
didn't make a squeak, huh?

16:33.479 --> 16:37.082
No. No.
Nothing on the radio.

16:43.922 --> 16:45.322
Might as well give it
a rest, Professor.

16:45.356 --> 16:47.291
You're not going anywhere.

16:50.162 --> 16:51.929
Captain Weaver's
completely lost it.

16:51.964 --> 16:54.398
He's become a threat
to the entire 2nd Mass.

16:54.433 --> 16:56.200
That doesn't scare you?

16:56.235 --> 16:58.737
Commanding officer gives you
an order, you obey.

16:59.300 --> 17:01.467
10th Mountain Division?

17:01.502 --> 17:02.836
Did you see any combat?

17:02.870 --> 17:06.415
Iraq, Afghanistan --
damn straight.

17:06.415 --> 17:07.683
Okay, so have I.

17:07.717 --> 17:09.218
So has every other person
in this regiment,

17:09.252 --> 17:10.586
both fighters
and civilians.

17:10.621 --> 17:13.256
I had you pegged
the first time I saw you.

17:13.290 --> 17:14.958
Big thinker,
always knows best.

17:14.992 --> 17:18.528
See, we had a Lieutenant
like you in our outfit.

17:18.563 --> 17:20.897
He got four
of our boys killed

17:20.932 --> 17:23.934
while he was
just weighing his options.

17:23.968 --> 17:26.904
You honestly believe that he's
fit to lead this mission?!

17:26.939 --> 17:28.439
Even at half-mast,
I trust the Captain

17:28.473 --> 17:31.242
a hell of a lot more
than I trust you.

17:38.783 --> 17:41.985
Pope, front and center.

17:45.791 --> 17:48.492
So, what is it?

17:48.526 --> 17:50.794
"Sir, yes, sir"?
"Aye, aye, skipper"?

17:50.828 --> 17:53.464
Cut the crap. Where do we stand
with the I.E.D.?

17:53.498 --> 17:55.398
I'll have you all wired up
by mañana. Don't fret it.

17:55.433 --> 17:59.002
There's been a change of plan.
I need four bombs.

18:00.705 --> 18:02.006
Can you do that?

18:02.040 --> 18:05.343
I got the ingredients
and enough barrels,

18:05.377 --> 18:07.445
but you split
that blasting fuse four ways,

18:07.480 --> 18:10.349
and you're gonna have what you
call a very short interval

18:10.383 --> 18:14.620
between lighting it
and, uh...Boom.

18:15.823 --> 18:18.491
But, yeah.

18:18.526 --> 18:21.294
I thought we were just taking
out one leg of that thing.

18:21.329 --> 18:24.465
If you want to get along
with me, Pope, don't think.

18:24.499 --> 18:25.833
Just do what I tell you.

18:27.469 --> 18:29.036
All right.

18:31.974 --> 18:33.374
What did he want?

18:34.709 --> 18:36.243
Weaver?

18:38.813 --> 18:41.080
A little of this,
a little of that.

18:59.234 --> 19:01.837
I thought it was them
at first.

19:01.871 --> 19:03.538
You heard it, too?

19:06.209 --> 19:08.544
I'm glad
it wasn't the Skitters.

19:08.579 --> 19:10.713
So are you, right?

19:14.618 --> 19:16.952
What are they trying
to do with this?

19:16.987 --> 19:19.221
Scott thinks
he might be able to use it

19:19.256 --> 19:20.789
to contact
resistance groups,

19:20.824 --> 19:23.025
maybe jam the signals
between Skitters.

19:23.059 --> 19:26.696
But if he does that,
they might not find us.

19:26.730 --> 19:29.132
Is this, like, your new thing --
creeping me out?

19:30.701 --> 19:33.303
Why haven't you told
the other humans about me?

19:33.337 --> 19:35.872
Because I keep hoping
you'll stop talking like that,

19:35.907 --> 19:39.243
realize that everything the
Skitters did to us was wrong.

19:39.277 --> 19:40.411
You're human, too.

19:40.445 --> 19:42.413
I don't want to be.

19:42.448 --> 19:45.550
You're not telling them
'cause you're scared,

19:45.584 --> 19:49.921
'cause you can feel
the change coming.

19:49.956 --> 19:53.157
Is that why I can hear
the radio?

19:57.929 --> 20:00.564
What's happening
to us, Rick?

20:00.598 --> 20:03.767
I hope they come soon.

20:13.878 --> 20:16.847
Hey, Maggie!
How was the prom?!

20:18.516 --> 20:20.484
Bad news for us.

20:20.518 --> 20:21.785
But it ought to make

20:21.819 --> 20:23.720
a Skitter-killing degenerate
like you happy.

20:23.755 --> 20:25.422
Captain.

20:25.457 --> 20:27.658
What are you doing
back so soon?

20:27.692 --> 20:29.760
Saw fresh signs
of Skitters and Mechs

20:29.794 --> 20:31.495
all down 119
and Route 2.

20:31.529 --> 20:33.030
They redeployed.

20:33.064 --> 20:35.632
In that case, we'll just have
to punch through.

20:35.666 --> 20:38.836
Convoy's a tempting target,
especially on the open road.

20:38.870 --> 20:40.271
Then we'll
take back roads

20:40.305 --> 20:41.539
and we'll crawl
through the brush.

20:41.573 --> 20:43.874
You're dismissed.

20:43.909 --> 20:46.010
This just keeps getting
better and better.

20:46.044 --> 20:48.545
I'm gonna find my dad.

20:49.514 --> 20:51.882
Hal.

20:51.916 --> 20:53.217
Wait up.

20:54.886 --> 20:56.086
I don't believe this.

20:56.120 --> 20:57.587
Weaver's holding Tom
in custody?

20:57.621 --> 20:59.456
Danner's watching him
in the boiler room.

20:59.491 --> 21:02.459
Tom was asking about the drugs
he was taking, and he lost it.

21:02.493 --> 21:04.828
I'm not surprised.

21:05.863 --> 21:07.764
I don't think Weaver wants
to hurt your dad.

21:07.798 --> 21:10.900
I don't know why he's doing
this, but he's a good man.

21:10.934 --> 21:13.703
Good man or not,
he's endangering everyone here.

21:13.737 --> 21:15.471
We got to get
my dad out.

21:15.505 --> 21:17.506
Maybe I could help.

21:17.540 --> 21:20.475
Dr. Glass?

21:20.509 --> 21:22.277
Okay.

21:22.311 --> 21:25.613
Hal, when you get Tom,
you bring him here.

21:41.830 --> 21:45.267
Weaver ordered me
to bring down some chow.

21:45.301 --> 21:47.736
Everybody's got
to eat, huh?

21:50.841 --> 21:53.709
Watch him.

22:15.633 --> 22:18.201
Ugh! Aah!

22:29.780 --> 22:31.948
Aah!

22:33.384 --> 22:34.551
Dad!

22:34.585 --> 22:36.586
Give me something
to tie him up!

22:41.125 --> 22:42.892
What are you
doing here?

22:42.927 --> 22:44.561
Well, we tried to make it to the
five-mile mark, and we couldn't.

22:44.595 --> 22:45.962
We saw fresh signs
of Skitters and Mechs.

22:45.997 --> 22:48.031
You tell that to Weaver?

22:48.065 --> 22:49.399
First thing.

22:49.433 --> 22:50.767
- What about the attack?
- He didn't care.

22:50.801 --> 22:52.769
We are
"punching through."

22:52.803 --> 22:55.571
Dai's coming around.

22:55.606 --> 22:57.440
- Dad, what are we gonna do with him?
- Leave him.

22:57.474 --> 22:58.908
Oh. You son of a bitch.

22:58.942 --> 23:01.076
We got to find a way
to stop Weaver.

23:08.503 --> 23:11.405
He's weak,
but he'll pull through.

23:12.048 --> 23:13.640
I know you're hurting, Dai,
but this is important.

23:13.641 --> 23:14.907
I need to know
about Porter.

23:14.942 --> 23:17.744
An hour after I reached
Porter's post,

23:17.778 --> 23:19.079
the Skitters
and Mechs hit.

23:19.114 --> 23:22.516
Porter was
pinned down...

23:24.652 --> 23:25.986
...Probably dead
by now.

23:26.020 --> 23:27.154
Dead?

23:30.458 --> 23:33.828
His team laid down
cover fire for me.

23:33.862 --> 23:37.431
I got hit
when a Mech blew up.

23:37.466 --> 23:41.536
Dai, this is important.
What were Porter's orders?

23:41.570 --> 23:46.941
The other regiments --
they never reported in.

23:46.976 --> 23:50.411
Runners went out,
never came back.

23:50.446 --> 23:52.914
And Porter said

23:52.949 --> 23:57.585
that without confirmation
the 4th and 5th were alive,

23:57.620 --> 23:59.420
the attack
should be aborted.

23:59.455 --> 24:00.588
You told that
to Captain Weaver?

24:00.623 --> 24:02.957
All of it.

24:02.991 --> 24:07.128
This mission...
Is no good.

24:14.336 --> 24:17.639
So, we're in this alone?

24:17.673 --> 24:20.809
Weaver sure doesn't have
a problem with tall odds.

24:20.843 --> 24:23.945
It's not like him to disobey
an order from Porter.

24:23.980 --> 24:25.480
What is he thinking?

24:25.515 --> 24:26.748
He's thinking he's gonna
go ahead with the mission,

24:26.782 --> 24:27.782
facts on the ground
be damned.

24:27.817 --> 24:29.351
So, how do we stop him?

24:29.386 --> 24:31.754
He's got all the fighters
and all the weapons.

24:33.156 --> 24:36.459
Most of them.

24:36.493 --> 24:38.161
Not all.

24:47.138 --> 24:49.173
What the hell?

24:53.011 --> 24:54.645
What happened?

24:54.680 --> 24:57.482
It was Mason and the kid...

24:57.517 --> 25:00.019
Jimmy.

25:00.053 --> 25:01.721
Jimmy?

25:06.494 --> 25:08.328
Try to keep this
from the civilians.

25:08.362 --> 25:10.297
We don't want a panic.

25:10.331 --> 25:12.933
Grab four men we can trust
and find Mason.

25:17.772 --> 25:22.075
Somebody's got their panties
in a twist.

25:25.379 --> 25:26.713
Ben.

25:26.747 --> 25:29.015
Been here long?

25:29.049 --> 25:29.982
Little while.

25:30.017 --> 25:31.851
I -- I've been waiting
for you.

25:31.885 --> 25:35.021
Well, I'm glad
for the company.

25:39.860 --> 25:42.896
Scott, we're kind of
like friends, right?

25:42.930 --> 25:45.866
Oh, I think it's more
than just "kind of."

25:45.901 --> 25:47.401
Mm.

25:47.436 --> 25:51.205
You'd keep a secret if I asked
you, wouldn't you?

25:53.876 --> 25:54.909
Ben, what's the matter?

25:54.944 --> 25:58.279
Actually, I'm not sure.

25:58.314 --> 26:00.415
Can you turn it on?

26:00.449 --> 26:01.449
The transmitter?

26:01.483 --> 26:03.051
Yeah.
Why?

26:03.085 --> 26:04.352
Please?

26:04.387 --> 26:07.689
All right.

26:12.361 --> 26:14.429
Okay, now, um...

26:14.463 --> 26:17.666
Just, um, go through the
frequencies like you did before.

26:29.814 --> 26:30.981
Ugh!

26:31.016 --> 26:32.283
Ben!

26:32.317 --> 26:35.886
Keep going.
Keep going.

26:38.022 --> 26:40.257
Ugh!
Ben! Hey!

26:40.291 --> 26:41.958
Are you all right?
What's happened?

26:47.631 --> 26:49.765
I don't know what I am.

26:53.670 --> 26:56.973
Maybe. Worth a shot.
Yeah.

27:08.119 --> 27:09.453
Dad!

27:09.487 --> 27:10.955
Matt, what are you
doing in here?

27:10.989 --> 27:12.556
- I told him it wasn't a good idea.
- I'm not talking to you.

27:12.591 --> 27:14.458
Come on, go back
to the quarters right now.

27:14.492 --> 27:15.993
I-I was only trying to --
I don't want to hear it. Go, right now!

27:16.027 --> 27:19.897
Ah.
Go!

27:19.932 --> 27:21.700
Everything okay,
Professor?

27:21.734 --> 27:24.369
Be a lot better if you'd stay
the hell away from my kids.

27:25.905 --> 27:27.572
Well, I'm assuming
because of the gun there

27:27.607 --> 27:29.274
and that look on your face,
this is something

27:29.309 --> 27:31.076
a little bit more
than a domestic issue.

27:31.110 --> 27:34.012
Porter's dead, the other
regiments are probably gone,

27:34.046 --> 27:36.481
and Weaver still plans to make
the attack on the structure.

27:36.515 --> 27:38.917
That explains
why el capitán asked me

27:38.951 --> 27:40.918
to split the bomb up
into four separate charges.

27:45.024 --> 27:46.491
What do you want with me?

27:46.525 --> 27:48.393
You put them together.
You can take them apart.

27:48.427 --> 27:49.961
Why the hell
would I do that?

27:49.996 --> 27:52.597
I'd say for the sake
of the 2nd Mass.

27:53.933 --> 27:56.602
But I doubt that would mean
anything to you.

27:56.637 --> 27:59.239
Sounds like a plan.

27:59.273 --> 28:01.808
All you got to do now
is survive long enough

28:01.842 --> 28:03.811
to convince those yahoos
out there that you're right.

28:03.845 --> 28:06.681
No. All I got to do
is convince Weaver.

28:17.272 --> 28:19.740
Captain Weaver.

28:19.775 --> 28:24.044
Dr. Glass, I hear
that Tom has been to see you.

28:24.079 --> 28:26.313
I need to know
where he is.

28:26.348 --> 28:29.149
He told me what you've been
going through, Captain.

28:29.183 --> 28:31.818
I'd feel a lot more comfortable
if you put that gun down.

28:31.853 --> 28:33.920
Don't.

28:39.326 --> 28:41.427
What are you gonna do?
You gonna shoot me?

28:41.461 --> 28:43.762
I'm the optimist,
remember?

28:43.797 --> 28:46.431
I'm still hoping that you're
gonna listen to reason.

28:46.466 --> 28:49.133
Now, what's the operational
plan -- the real one?

28:49.168 --> 28:51.603
Rendezvous with the 4th and 5th
and launch a coordinated attack!

28:51.604 --> 28:53.364
I talked to Dai!
Your orders were to stand down!

28:53.365 --> 28:55.600
That's not the way
I heard it.

28:56.074 --> 28:58.708
The mission's still a go unless the
4th and 5th are confirmed killed.

28:58.743 --> 29:00.150
Porter's last orders were to wait
for that confirmation.

29:00.175 --> 29:01.375
Damn it!

29:01.645 --> 29:03.914
The aliens have to know
we're not gonna lie down!

29:03.948 --> 29:06.749
You think I don't want
to fight them?! Move.

29:06.784 --> 29:08.818
This has to be done
the right way.

29:08.853 --> 29:10.453
That means all cards
on the table

29:10.487 --> 29:11.821
with a commanding officer

29:11.855 --> 29:13.622
whose judgment
hasn't been compromised.

29:13.657 --> 29:14.634
How far you gonna go
with this?

29:14.635 --> 29:16.388
Pretty far.
I had Pope defuse the bombs.

29:16.412 --> 29:18.416
And if you don't back off,

29:18.441 --> 29:20.041
I'm gonna be forced to relieve
you of your command.

29:20.163 --> 29:21.664
Ah, ah!

29:21.698 --> 29:24.133
You're fast, Maggie,
but not that fast.

29:25.868 --> 29:30.872
Sorry...But you may want
to reconsider that, Professor.

29:30.906 --> 29:34.942
Dad, what's he doing?
I thought you talked to him.

29:34.977 --> 29:36.411
I did.

29:36.445 --> 29:38.813
My apologies, Cambridge,
but, uh...

29:38.848 --> 29:42.951
I just couldn't bring myself
to defuse those charges.

29:42.985 --> 29:45.820
I figured I had a choice

29:45.855 --> 29:49.791
of either sitting around
or...Killing cooties,

29:49.826 --> 29:53.895
and, uh...
Cooties win every time.

29:53.930 --> 29:56.898
But you'll be happy to know
that those bombs are beauts.

29:56.933 --> 29:59.034
They're gonna cause
a lot of damage.

29:59.069 --> 30:00.336
No, they won't...

30:00.370 --> 30:02.405
Because when Pope came
to warn you,

30:02.439 --> 30:03.873
I took the blasting fuses.

30:03.907 --> 30:05.107
Bombs are
out of commission.

30:05.142 --> 30:06.642
Where are they?

30:06.677 --> 30:08.077
The aliens can't kill us
fast enough?

30:08.111 --> 30:11.013
We have to do it
for them?

30:11.048 --> 30:13.081
Where are the damn fuses?

30:13.116 --> 30:15.250
All right, you said

30:15.284 --> 30:17.419
that the only way
this is gonna work

30:17.453 --> 30:20.188
is if people have faith
in their commanding officer.

30:20.222 --> 30:21.255
That goes both ways.

30:21.290 --> 30:22.857
You have to have faith
in them.

30:22.891 --> 30:25.726
I'm doing this for them,
for all of us.

30:25.761 --> 30:26.994
All right, then tell them
the truth.

30:27.029 --> 30:28.996
- Tell them Porter's gone...
- Dad, whoa.

30:29.031 --> 30:31.198
...And that this attack,
whether we live or die,

30:31.232 --> 30:33.233
isn't gonna be
just a command decision.

30:35.436 --> 30:37.904
We don't have enough people left
for a suicide mission.

30:39.874 --> 30:42.109
Go ahead and do it.
Go ahead.

30:42.143 --> 30:44.478
If shooting me keeps
the 2nd Mass together,

30:44.512 --> 30:45.980
go ahead and do it.

30:46.014 --> 30:49.384
I'm not gonna be the one
that pulls it apart.

30:49.418 --> 30:51.453
There's another way.

30:51.487 --> 30:53.488
What?

30:53.523 --> 30:57.226
You can trust our people
the way they trust you.

31:01.198 --> 31:03.932
C-Captain.

31:08.170 --> 31:09.370
Jimmy?

31:14.076 --> 31:17.178
We want to follow you --
all of us.

31:26.922 --> 31:29.190
You just have to let us.

31:45.208 --> 31:47.209
Put down your weapon.

31:47.244 --> 31:48.845
What the hell
are you doing?

31:48.879 --> 31:50.980
Lower your weapon.

32:00.657 --> 32:02.992
I'm not saying
you're right.

32:03.027 --> 32:06.696
But they deserve to know
the facts of the mission.

32:06.731 --> 32:09.666
Call for volunteers.
But they got to hear both sides.

32:09.700 --> 32:12.836
And they will...

32:12.870 --> 32:16.940
'Cause you'll be
right there beside me.

32:20.945 --> 32:24.114
Jimmy, gather everyone
in the gym.

32:24.148 --> 32:25.315
10 minutes.

32:25.350 --> 32:27.651
Y-yes, sir.

32:27.686 --> 32:30.154
You sure
you're ready for this?

32:30.188 --> 32:31.321
Yeah.

32:31.356 --> 32:33.190
Yeah.

32:33.225 --> 32:38.362
By the way, I quit taking
those pills since we got back.

32:39.765 --> 32:43.167
I don't need to tell you people
what's at stake.

32:43.202 --> 32:47.038
We all been living on the edge
since these alien things came.

32:47.072 --> 32:51.209
Tomorrow's assault
on the structure in Boston

32:51.243 --> 32:54.479
was meant to be
a first strike --

32:54.513 --> 32:56.113
a coordinated attack

32:56.148 --> 32:58.716
with the support of two other
Massachusetts regiments.

32:58.751 --> 33:00.618
However...

33:00.653 --> 33:06.157
Colonel Porter lost contact
with these regiments

33:06.192 --> 33:07.925
several days ago.

33:07.960 --> 33:09.327
And now it looks

33:09.361 --> 33:12.998
as if the Colonel himself
might have been lost.

33:17.203 --> 33:22.007
Dai brought back
the Colonel's last order --

33:22.041 --> 33:23.809
abort the mission

33:23.843 --> 33:28.614
unless we can confirm the
existence of these other units.

33:29.783 --> 33:33.653
We still don't know
if these other units exist...

33:33.687 --> 33:39.726
Or if they intend to carry out
the attack as planned.

33:39.760 --> 33:42.929
But I know...

33:42.964 --> 33:47.167
That if there's
a breath left...

33:47.202 --> 33:49.404
In any of those men,

33:49.438 --> 33:52.807
they will do their damnedest
to carry out this attack.

33:52.842 --> 33:57.312
And if that happens,
despite Porter's order...

33:57.346 --> 34:01.682
The 2nd Mass has to be there
to back them up.

34:01.717 --> 34:04.351
But this attack,

34:04.386 --> 34:07.955
as critical as it is,

34:07.989 --> 34:11.324
cannot be our only objective.

34:11.359 --> 34:15.728
We have a responsibility...

34:15.763 --> 34:18.965
An obligation...

34:19.000 --> 34:23.204
To...Protect our civilians.

34:24.907 --> 34:29.110
And sometimes,
in our desire to strike back,

34:29.145 --> 34:32.214
we forget...

34:32.248 --> 34:34.417
That they represent our future.

34:35.819 --> 34:38.021
So I'm asking for volunteers.

34:38.054 --> 34:40.989
I need 50 fighters
for this mission.

34:41.025 --> 34:46.529
If you're with me,
meet me in front.

34:50.266 --> 34:52.333
I'm in.

34:52.368 --> 34:53.935
Go to the front.

34:53.969 --> 34:56.004
Let's do this.
Let's get this job done, man.

34:56.038 --> 34:58.039
It's time
for some payback.

34:58.073 --> 34:59.140
Let's go, guys.

34:59.174 --> 35:00.208
Aw, hell.

35:08.852 --> 35:11.154
It's true.

35:11.188 --> 35:12.922
The fighters
can't do this

35:12.957 --> 35:15.859
unless they know their people
are in good hands.

35:21.066 --> 35:22.266
It's gonna
sound strange,

35:22.300 --> 35:23.867
but I wish I was going
with you.

35:23.901 --> 35:27.003
Porter knew
what he was doing

35:27.038 --> 35:29.139
when he made you
my second in command.

35:30.874 --> 35:33.142
Keep these people safe.

35:38.681 --> 35:42.116
Okay, everybody,
let's get our gear together.

35:42.150 --> 35:43.885
We want to be able to move out

35:43.919 --> 35:46.320
as soon as our strike team
comes home.

36:06.050 --> 36:08.251
What's with
the stink eye, kid?

36:08.286 --> 36:11.521
I know
what you did to my dad.

36:11.555 --> 36:13.490
Is that right?

36:13.524 --> 36:15.425
He thought
he could trust you.

36:15.459 --> 36:18.294
But he couldn't.
Nobody can.

36:18.329 --> 36:22.399
Trust...
Is an overrated commodity.

36:22.433 --> 36:24.300
The truth is,
you little punk,

36:24.335 --> 36:27.837
you're the kind of a kid who
should listen to his old man.

36:27.872 --> 36:30.707
That way, there's no chance
of ending up like me.

36:32.409 --> 36:35.311
I'll never be like you.

36:42.186 --> 36:44.087
That's pretty sweet,

36:44.121 --> 36:47.825
you getting put in your place
by an 8-year-old.

36:47.859 --> 36:51.362
So, first you're with Tom,
then you're with Weaver.

36:51.396 --> 36:54.932
What? So you're talking
to me now?

36:54.967 --> 36:56.334
Just this once.

36:56.368 --> 36:58.836
What the hell
is your plan, Pope?

36:58.871 --> 37:01.239
My plan, little miss midwife
with the heart of gold?

37:01.273 --> 37:03.508
You know me, Margaret.
What you see is what you get.

37:03.542 --> 37:05.343
I'm just another
upstanding member

37:05.377 --> 37:08.880
of the grand and glorious
2nd Massachusetts.

37:08.914 --> 37:11.316
So you're going through
with this attack.

37:11.350 --> 37:15.086
It's my duty
to both God and country.

37:15.120 --> 37:16.487
You know, I didn't see you

37:16.521 --> 37:19.389
volunteering for
the Captain's blitzkrieg here.

37:19.424 --> 37:21.826
Yeah, I don't ride
with sociopaths.

37:21.860 --> 37:26.331
You should remember that,
if it wasn't for me,

37:26.365 --> 37:29.200
you'd just be another
little Mech speck on a wall.

37:29.235 --> 37:31.903
I don't forget anything you did,
not a second of it.

37:31.938 --> 37:34.209
And I know exactly what
you'll do to these people

37:34.234 --> 37:35.634
if you get the chance.

37:36.076 --> 37:37.610
These people?

37:40.046 --> 37:43.582
Damn it, Maggie.
You drank the kool-aid.

37:43.617 --> 37:48.320
Do you actually think
for a second that humankind

37:48.355 --> 37:51.524
has even a hope in hell
in this war to end all wars?

37:51.558 --> 37:54.527
Let's just say
I'm along for the ride,

37:54.561 --> 37:57.029
and if I find you
crossing them,

37:57.063 --> 38:00.398
I'm gonna show you
exactly what you left behind.

38:00.433 --> 38:02.701
And I don't think
you're gonna like it.

38:06.240 --> 38:09.610
Sure be something to see,
though!

38:19.088 --> 38:21.389
Hal!

38:30.266 --> 38:32.200
You're right
about Weaver, but...

38:32.234 --> 38:35.036
When you get down to it,
well, he's right, too.

38:35.070 --> 38:38.105
They got enough fighters.
You don't have to do this.

38:38.139 --> 38:40.641
Yes, I do.
I actually do.

38:40.675 --> 38:42.109
You got to stay here,

38:42.143 --> 38:43.577
and you got to take care
of the civilians,

38:43.611 --> 38:45.145
just like you've been taking
care of me, Matt, and Ben

38:45.180 --> 38:46.313
this whole time.

38:46.347 --> 38:50.551
And I got to do this...
For mom...

38:50.585 --> 38:53.354
And Ben,
and for Karen.

38:53.388 --> 38:56.090
There'll be other battles.

38:56.124 --> 38:58.226
Not if we don't show them
we're not backing down.

38:58.260 --> 38:59.794
We got to hit them
with everything we got.

38:59.828 --> 39:02.297
We got to make them
rethink this war.

39:02.332 --> 39:04.432
Weaver can get us
to Boston.

39:04.467 --> 39:06.034
And once we get there,

39:06.068 --> 39:08.202
we're gonna blow that structure
straight to hell.

39:08.237 --> 39:11.239
Nothing I can say
to you, huh?

39:11.273 --> 39:14.109
You could wish me luck.

39:14.143 --> 39:17.379
Good luck.

39:24.586 --> 39:26.421
All right, good luck.

39:35.497 --> 39:37.031
Tom.

39:37.065 --> 39:38.499
Mech bullets.

39:38.533 --> 39:40.634
Thought you might
need them.

39:44.239 --> 39:45.640
Good hunting.

39:51.146 --> 39:54.382
Dad! Dad, I have
to talk to you.

39:56.419 --> 39:59.354
Scott was running these tests
with the transmitter, um...

39:59.389 --> 40:00.655
Yeah.

40:00.690 --> 40:02.190
...Trying to see if he could
block the signals

40:02.225 --> 40:03.558
between the Skitters
and the Mechs.

40:03.593 --> 40:05.627
Yeah, j-- like a, you know,
a jamming signal.

40:05.662 --> 40:08.430
Yeah. How would -- how would you
even know if that worked?

40:08.465 --> 40:11.166
We wouldn't, but...

40:11.200 --> 40:12.434
We were running some tests,

40:12.468 --> 40:14.202
going through
the frequencies.

40:14.236 --> 40:16.538
And what?

40:16.572 --> 40:19.807
I could hear it.

40:22.456 --> 40:24.324
Move out!
