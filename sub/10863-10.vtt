I got you!

00:34.880 --> 00:35.800
You're mine!

00:35.800 --> 00:37.040
It's over!

00:37.040 --> 00:38.800
This is pitiful.

00:40.880 --> 00:42.520
Hi, guys.

00:42.520 --> 00:44.520
Hey, hi.

00:44.520 --> 00:45.520
Ow!

00:45.520 --> 00:47.680
No fair!
I was distracted!

00:47.680 --> 00:48.920
Yeah, right.

00:48.920 --> 00:50.000
I was!

00:50.000 --> 00:52.120
Let's go again.
You and me. Come on.

00:52.120 --> 00:53.560
Forget it, pee wee.

00:53.560 --> 00:56.840
Hey, I can beat you
anytime, anyplace.

00:56.840 --> 00:58.240
What's going on?

00:58.240 --> 01:01.040
Tucker's mad because
Kiki called him a runt.

01:01.040 --> 01:02.440
I'm sorry, OK?

01:02.440 --> 01:03.680
No, you're not.

01:03.680 --> 01:05.160
You're just scared
I'm gonna beat you.

01:05.160 --> 01:07.720
Yeah, that must be it.
I'm--I'm scared.

01:07.720 --> 01:09.240
Speaking of scared,

01:09.240 --> 01:11.160
you're up
tonight, Sam.

01:11.160 --> 01:12.160
You ready?

01:12.160 --> 01:13.240
Sure.

01:16.440 --> 01:21.160
I've got a story about
something incredibly horrifying.

01:21.160 --> 01:23.280
But it's not
monsters or demons

01:23.280 --> 01:27.280
or any of the usual
scary stuff.

01:27.280 --> 01:30.480
It's about something
that can strike any one of us

01:30.480 --> 01:32.080
at any time.

01:32.080 --> 01:35.320
And it's always
when we least expect it.

01:35.320 --> 01:36.320
What is it?

01:36.320 --> 01:38.560
True love.

01:38.560 --> 01:40.600
You're kidding.

01:40.600 --> 01:44.200
Come on.
Who says love isn't scary?

01:44.200 --> 01:47.080
It can really
hurt sometimes.

01:47.080 --> 01:49.200
But love is
what people live for.

01:49.200 --> 01:50.640
And in my story,

01:50.640 --> 01:53.040
it's sort of
what they die for.

01:55.400 --> 01:59.000
Submitted for the approval
of the Midnight Society,

01:59.000 --> 02:00.960
I call this story...

02:10.120 --> 02:12.320
<i> Johnny and Erica
were brother and sister,</i>

02:12.320 --> 02:15.080
<i> and they were really close.</i>

02:15.080 --> 02:16.080
Yeah!

02:16.080 --> 02:17.080
Come on.

02:17.080 --> 02:18.120
It's quarter after.

02:18.120 --> 02:19.640
I've got a ton
of homework,

02:19.640 --> 02:21.120
and we gotta
close up.

02:21.120 --> 02:23.240
Yeah, yeah. I just finished
lubing the pin setter.

02:23.240 --> 02:25.080
I gotta make sure
it won't crash on me.

02:25.080 --> 02:27.320
Yeah, right.
You're just playing.

02:27.320 --> 02:29.320
<i> They even worked
at the same place,</i>

02:29.320 --> 02:31.400
<i> the Bowl-A-Rama lanes.</i>

02:31.400 --> 02:32.400
Yeah!

02:32.400 --> 02:33.560
Perfect.

02:33.560 --> 02:35.200
As usual.

02:35.200 --> 02:36.880
And modest, too.

02:36.880 --> 02:39.360
Hey, did I ever tell you

02:39.360 --> 02:41.120
you're my favorite sister?

02:41.120 --> 02:44.440
I'm your only sister.

02:44.440 --> 02:45.440
Yeah.

02:45.440 --> 02:47.120
Hurry up.

02:47.120 --> 02:49.160
<i> Erica was a waitress.</i>

02:49.160 --> 02:51.400
<i> Johnny, the repair guy.</i>

02:54.520 --> 02:55.640
You coming or what?

02:55.640 --> 02:56.800
Yeah, yeah.
You put this in here?

02:56.800 --> 02:57.800
Nope.

02:57.800 --> 02:59.720
It's a girl's ring.

03:00.880 --> 03:02.160
Oh, it's stuck.

03:02.160 --> 03:04.080
Really?

03:05.960 --> 03:08.360
Great. Now you can
go steady with yourself.

03:08.360 --> 03:10.080
Yeah,
Hardy har har.

03:10.080 --> 03:11.640
Meet you in the front.

03:14.960 --> 03:16.560
I can't get
this thing off.

03:16.560 --> 03:17.560
Johnny!

03:17.560 --> 03:18.640
Sorry.

03:20.240 --> 03:21.560
Did you try soap?

03:21.560 --> 03:23.920
I tried everything except
cutting my finger off.

03:23.920 --> 03:26.200
Bedtime. School tomorrow.

03:26.200 --> 03:28.520
Come on, Mom.
I've still gotta...

03:28.520 --> 03:30.600
Erica, please.
Don't argue.

03:30.600 --> 03:33.200
It's late.

03:33.200 --> 03:34.560
Good-night, Mom.

03:36.160 --> 03:37.800
Geez, what's
the matter with her?

03:37.800 --> 03:41.600
Oh, she's got
a lot on her mind.

03:41.600 --> 03:43.080
Yeah, I guess so.

03:43.080 --> 03:44.400
So, you coming or what?

03:44.400 --> 03:46.600
No, I'm gonna do a
little channel surfing.

03:46.600 --> 03:47.600
Get the light,
will you?

03:47.600 --> 03:48.680
Good-night.

03:57.040 --> 04:00.080
<i>Woman's voice: Johnny?</i>

04:00.080 --> 04:02.000
<i> Johnny,
where are you?</i>

04:02.000 --> 04:04.800
<i> There you are.</i>

04:04.800 --> 04:08.000
Johnny, wake up.

04:10.680 --> 04:11.840
Johnny.

04:25.440 --> 04:26.480
Oh, man.

04:39.600 --> 04:41.440
Give me a cola,
would you, Erica?

04:42.920 --> 04:46.560
Man, I am living
a charmed life.

04:46.560 --> 04:47.760
Really? Why?

04:47.760 --> 04:49.120
Just closed out
another month

04:49.120 --> 04:51.000
without having to hire
another maintenance guy.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.080
We haven't had
a breakdown in 4 months.

04:54.080 --> 04:56.920
The longer I hold off
hiring somebody,

04:56.920 --> 04:58.840
the better my books look,

04:58.840 --> 05:00.480
the better I look.

05:00.480 --> 05:03.160
Life is s-s-sweet.

05:05.560 --> 05:06.720
Thanks.

05:11.840 --> 05:13.080
Yeah, thanks to me.

05:13.080 --> 05:14.440
What are you
doing out here?

05:14.440 --> 05:15.520
Why can't
I come out here?

05:15.520 --> 05:16.960
Uh...

05:16.960 --> 05:19.720
He'll pitch a fit if you
get grease on everything.

05:19.720 --> 05:20.720
Well, good.

05:20.720 --> 05:22.480
At least
he'll know I'm around.

05:22.480 --> 05:24.360
Who does he think keeps
this place running, anyway?

05:24.360 --> 05:25.520
Don't worry about it.

05:25.520 --> 05:27.000
Erica, I can't
do it all myself.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.960
I swear,
if he doesn't...

05:30.040 --> 05:31.200
What?

05:34.240 --> 05:35.800
You promise not to laugh
if I tell you something?

05:35.800 --> 05:36.550
No.

05:39.560 --> 05:43.000
I've been having these
really weird dreams lately

05:43.000 --> 05:45.400
about this beautiful girl

05:45.400 --> 05:47.760
with long hair
and amazing eyes.

05:47.760 --> 05:50.080
Yeah, so? You and
every other guy.

05:50.080 --> 05:52.000
Yeah, but it's so real.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.200
You know, I've never
seen her before,

05:54.200 --> 05:56.480
and I can't stop
thinking about her.

05:56.480 --> 06:00.560
And she looks a lot like
that girl over there.

06:02.120 --> 06:03.640
Cheryl Lightheart?

06:03.640 --> 06:07.440
I know, I know
it sounds stupid.

06:07.440 --> 06:09.040
But maybe this dream
is some kind of sign.

06:10.440 --> 06:12.520
This could be fate.

06:12.520 --> 06:13.880
Johnny, wait.

06:13.880 --> 06:17.440
That's OK, Elaine,
I'll handle it.

06:17.440 --> 06:19.360
And how may
I help you ladies?

06:19.360 --> 06:22.920
I said a size 6,
not a size 9.

06:22.920 --> 06:25.040
Are your eyes
upside down or something?

06:27.200 --> 06:28.120
Hi, Cheryl.

06:28.120 --> 06:29.560
Uh, you don't
know me,

06:29.560 --> 06:32.480
and I don't know how
to say this, but uh...

06:36.960 --> 06:39.440
You guys hear
someone talking to me?

06:39.440 --> 06:41.920
I don't see anyone.
Must be your imagination.

06:41.920 --> 06:42.720
Come on. Let's go.

06:42.720 --> 06:43.760
Yeah.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.040
Must be great
to be so perfect.

06:48.040 --> 06:49.280
Yeah...

07:11.120 --> 07:12.360

07:12.360 --> 07:13.880

07:13.880 --> 07:15.440

07:16.960 --> 07:19.360

Who?

07:20.360 --> 07:21.960
<i> It's Donna, Johnny.</i>

07:31.800 --> 07:34.000
Johnny?

07:34.000 --> 07:36.080
Johnny. It's me.
It's Donna.

07:36.080 --> 07:38.960
Don't--
Don't move!

and what a surprise,

08:34.320 --> 08:35.320
more bills.

08:35.320 --> 08:36.400
Hey, Mom.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.679
Mom.

08:40.679 --> 08:41.840
You forgot this.

08:48.400 --> 08:49.600
It's for me.

08:57.160 --> 08:58.360

09:06.560 --> 09:07.760
Where'd
you get this?

09:07.760 --> 09:09.760
It's the girl.

09:09.760 --> 09:11.040
That's the girl
from my dreams.

09:12.400 --> 09:14.280
"Meet me tonight,
midnight.

09:14.280 --> 09:17.200
I'll be at the
Bowl-A-Rama Snack Bar."

09:17.200 --> 09:19.800
That's
after closing.

09:19.800 --> 09:21.280
You gonna go?

09:21.280 --> 09:24.080
I don't know.

09:24.080 --> 09:27.800
I mean,
I guess I should, but...

09:27.800 --> 09:30.280
Man, I have a really
weird feeling about this.

09:30.280 --> 09:33.960
You have to see her,
Erica. She's so beautiful.

09:33.960 --> 09:36.800
There's just
something about her.

09:36.800 --> 09:38.400
I've gotta find out
who she is.

About time
you showed up.

10:15.360 --> 10:16.800

you doing here?

10:16.800 --> 10:18.320
This place is supposed
to be closed.

10:18.320 --> 10:21.200
Closed? Huh, never.

10:22.480 --> 10:25.360
Let's just say we're the uh
-- night shift.

Hot apple pie
a la mode,

10:41.320 --> 10:42.560

10:42.560 --> 10:45.520
That's my favorite.
How'd you know that?

10:45.520 --> 10:47.320
We know.

10:47.320 --> 10:48.520
We know.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.840
What's your hurry?

11:22.800 --> 11:23.920
Johnny?

11:26.000 --> 11:28.920
I uh--
hope I'm not late.

11:30.320 --> 11:31.320
Uh...

11:33.200 --> 11:34.240
Uh...

11:34.240 --> 11:35.840
I thought
you weren't gonna show.

11:35.840 --> 11:38.200
I'd never
stand you up.

11:40.080 --> 11:43.160
I can't. You're
wearing my ring.

11:43.160 --> 11:44.800
This is yours?

Let's dance.

11:57.800 --> 11:59.760
Who are you?

11:59.760 --> 12:02.200
How do you know me?

12:02.200 --> 12:03.880
You must know.

12:03.880 --> 12:05.680
You're wearing my ring.

12:05.680 --> 12:07.200
Yes,
but I found...

12:07.200 --> 12:08.200
Shh.

12:08.200 --> 12:10.560
It's almost
time to go.

You just got here.

12:16.680 --> 12:18.440
But it's almost time.

12:19.360 --> 12:21.760
Better hurry.

12:25.880 --> 12:27.320
Oh, it's too late.

12:27.320 --> 12:28.520
Too--too late?

12:28.520 --> 12:30.440
I'll wait for you,
Johnny.

12:30.440 --> 12:32.040
Wait? For what?

12:51.080 --> 12:52.320
Erica?

12:53.560 --> 12:56.880
Erica. Oh, man, you're
not gonna believe this.

12:56.880 --> 12:58.080
She was there.

12:58.080 --> 12:59.360
Donna met me but...

12:59.360 --> 13:00.560
Wait.

13:00.560 --> 13:02.760
Before you say
anything else,

13:02.760 --> 13:05.280
is this the girl
you've been seeing?

13:05.280 --> 13:07.080
Yeah. Donna,
Donna Maitland.

13:07.080 --> 13:08.600
What's she doing...

13:08.600 --> 13:09.520
She's dead, Johnny.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.120
What?

13:12.120 --> 13:14.000
She died in
a car accident.

13:19.080 --> 13:21.800
She was driving
with her boyfriend

13:21.800 --> 13:24.000
and their car stalled
on these railroad tracks

13:24.000 --> 13:25.800
just out by
Waterloo road.

13:27.240 --> 13:30.280
They both got out,
but Donna forgot her ring,

13:30.280 --> 13:33.080
this school ring that her
boyfriend had just given her.

13:35.040 --> 13:37.040
So she went back
to get it,

13:37.040 --> 13:41.040
and the train came.

13:41.040 --> 13:42.440
The ring.

13:45.080 --> 13:46.440
She said
I had her ring.

13:48.480 --> 13:49.800
She was there,
Erica. I swear it.

13:49.800 --> 13:51.600
I mean,
I talked to her.

13:53.080 --> 13:56.520
She's a ghost...

13:56.520 --> 13:59.560
And she said that she
wanted me to go with her.

14:01.840 --> 14:03.480
And it's all
'cause of this.

14:18.120 --> 14:21.400
Why won't
this thing budge?

14:32.960 --> 14:34.520
Don't run from me,
Johnny.

14:36.560 --> 14:37.840
I want you
to come with me.

14:37.840 --> 14:39.480
Take your stupid
ring back.

14:39.480 --> 14:40.800
I don't want it.

14:40.800 --> 14:42.480
Don't you understand?

14:42.480 --> 14:44.960
It's you that I want.

14:44.960 --> 14:47.160
You must know that by now.

14:47.160 --> 14:49.480
Just--just
leave me alone.

14:49.480 --> 14:50.560
It's time, Johnny.

14:50.560 --> 14:51.560
No!

14:51.560 --> 14:53.000
Johnny?

14:55.360 --> 14:57.600
Johnny?

14:57.600 --> 14:59.200
Are you OK?

15:02.040 --> 15:03.040
What?

15:05.320 --> 15:06.640
Did you see her?

15:08.240 --> 15:09.240
Who?

15:17.200 --> 15:19.480
Would you sit down
and relax, please?

15:19.480 --> 15:20.480
Yeah, OK. When a
ghost comes after you,

15:20.480 --> 15:21.880
let's see if
you can relax.

15:25.960 --> 15:26.880
Johnny,

15:26.880 --> 15:28.360
are you sure
it's the ring

15:28.360 --> 15:29.840
that's making
all this happen?

15:31.000 --> 15:32.240
What do you mean?

15:32.240 --> 15:33.320
[Telephone rings]

15:35.640 --> 15:36.920
Oh, man.

15:36.920 --> 15:38.000
I'm like a raw nerve.

15:40.520 --> 15:41.520
Hello?

15:48.480 --> 15:49.960
It's for you.

15:50.600 --> 15:51.920
Me?

15:51.920 --> 15:53.200
It's Donna.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.440
Look, this is all
some kind of joke,

16:06.440 --> 16:08.040
and I'm not buying it
anymore. Understand?

16:08.040 --> 16:10.120
This isn't funny,
so just leave me alone.

16:11.720 --> 16:14.440
Donna:
I'm sorry, Johnny.

16:14.440 --> 16:16.920
I won't bother
you anymore.

16:16.920 --> 16:18.400
[Click]

16:26.320 --> 16:27.960
You still think
this is all a joke?

16:30.960 --> 16:31.960
I don't know.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.680
You know, maybe all she
wants is her ring back.

16:40.440 --> 16:41.720
Maybe I should
give it to her.

16:41.720 --> 16:43.360
Well, how are
you gonna do that?

16:43.360 --> 16:44.880
You told her
to leave you alone.

16:44.880 --> 16:46.600
Then I gotta find her.

16:46.600 --> 16:47.600
How?

16:48.800 --> 16:49.920
Well, if she's
really a ghost...

16:56.880 --> 16:58.880
I can think of a pretty
good place to start.

17:28.040 --> 17:29.000
Hey, you OK?

17:29.000 --> 17:31.320
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

17:31.320 --> 17:32.760
I'm just a little
jumpy, that's all.

17:32.760 --> 17:34.840
You find anything?

17:34.840 --> 17:36.640
Uh--no. You?

17:36.640 --> 17:37.840
No.

17:38.880 --> 17:39.880
But...

17:45.120 --> 17:46.320
Look at this.

17:46.320 --> 17:47.480
Donna Maitland.

17:49.400 --> 17:50.960
This is it.
This is her grave.

17:50.960 --> 17:52.080
You sure?

17:52.080 --> 17:53.600
Well, yeah,
look at it.

17:53.600 --> 17:54.960
How many other Donna
Maitlands could there be?

17:54.960 --> 17:56.480
Well, yeah, I guess.

17:56.480 --> 17:58.960
But how did you know
it would be right here?

17:58.960 --> 17:59.960
I didn't.

17:59.960 --> 18:01.280
I just kinda...

18:01.280 --> 18:02.320
Happened to wander
away from me,

18:02.320 --> 18:04.680
get lost,
and trip right over it?

18:09.600 --> 18:10.440
What are
you talking about?

18:14.400 --> 18:16.040
You knew exactly where
she was buried, Johnny.

18:16.040 --> 18:17.840
Why do you think
that is?

18:17.840 --> 18:20.280
Look, I don't
know what you mean.

18:20.280 --> 18:22.840
Maybe you've
been here before.

18:22.840 --> 18:24.160
Did you ever
think about that?

18:24.160 --> 18:25.680
No way! Why would
I have been here!

18:25.680 --> 18:26.800
It's a cemetery!

18:26.800 --> 18:28.840
Well, why don't
you tell me, Johnny?

18:30.440 --> 18:33.000
You remember
what happened.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.760
The car stalled
on the tracks, right?

18:35.760 --> 18:36.520
No.

18:39.320 --> 18:41.880
And then Donna got out
when she forgot her ring.

18:43.160 --> 18:45.240
Her school ring, and
went running back for it.

18:45.240 --> 18:46.360
<i> [Screaming] </i>

18:46.360 --> 18:47.520
<i> [Sound of train]</i>

18:47.520 --> 18:48.560
Donna!

18:56.880 --> 18:58.120
No.

19:04.280 --> 19:06.560
And then what happened,
Johnny?

19:07.920 --> 19:10.200
I turned back.

19:10.200 --> 19:12.360
I tried to push her
out of the way,

19:12.360 --> 19:13.520
but it was too late.

19:18.840 --> 19:20.200
Donna Maitland and John...

19:27.320 --> 19:28.320
It's me, isn't it?

19:28.320 --> 19:31.080
I'm afraid so.

19:41.800 --> 19:43.440
And that means that I'm...

19:47.280 --> 19:48.800
Why didn't
you just tell me?

19:48.800 --> 19:51.280
Because
you didn't remember!

19:51.280 --> 19:52.800
You just came back
from the accident

19:52.800 --> 19:55.680
and acted as if
nothing had happened.

19:55.680 --> 19:59.840
Johnny, I was the only one
who could see you.

19:59.840 --> 20:02.560
And for some
really weird reason,

20:02.560 --> 20:05.080
you didn't remember
the accident.

20:07.360 --> 20:07.840
You didn't even
know you were...

20:07.840 --> 20:09.080
Dead.

20:12.600 --> 20:15.040
No wonder Mom's
so bummed all the time.

20:17.360 --> 20:18.720
Don't make jokes.

20:18.720 --> 20:20.800
So what do I do?

20:20.800 --> 20:23.240
Well, now that you know,

20:23.240 --> 20:25.280
everything's gonna be OK.

20:25.280 --> 20:28.240
We can still be a family
and go on living and...

20:28.240 --> 20:30.120
Everything will be fine.

20:30.120 --> 20:30.960
Johnny?

20:32.880 --> 20:34.360
Is that you?

20:41.800 --> 20:44.160
You've come back to me?

20:48.640 --> 20:49.480
I uh...

20:52.480 --> 20:54.080
I don't think
I can stay.

20:58.040 --> 20:59.040
I know.

21:00.800 --> 21:02.760
You and Donna
belong together.

21:05.200 --> 21:07.160
It's time, Johnny.

21:08.480 --> 21:09.960
Go after her.

21:11.840 --> 21:13.840
You don't want to
lose her again.

21:16.160 --> 21:17.760
I'm really gonna
miss you, Erica.

21:19.920 --> 21:21.200
You know, you're
my favorite sister.

21:23.240 --> 21:24.520
I'm your only sister.

21:33.240 --> 21:34.480
Good-bye, Johnny.

21:35.760 --> 21:37.040
I love you.

21:38.760 --> 21:40.080
I love you, too.

22:56.400 --> 23:00.160
<i> Erica was always
going to miss Johnny,</i>

23:00.160 --> 23:01.800
<i> but it made her feel
better to know</i>

23:01.800 --> 23:04.360
<i> that he was happy at last</i>

23:04.360 --> 23:07.200
<i> with the girl
of his dreams.</i>

23:08.560 --> 23:09.520
The end.

23:09.520 --> 23:11.000
Good one, Sam.

23:11.000 --> 23:12.640
Cool.

23:12.640 --> 23:15.280
You're a ghost and
you don't know it.

23:15.280 --> 23:16.640
Yeah, like
you're a runt

23:16.640 --> 23:18.280
and you don't
even know it.

23:18.280 --> 23:20.000
I'll show you
who's a runt!

23:22.960 --> 23:24.400
I declare this meeting

23:24.400 --> 23:26.200
