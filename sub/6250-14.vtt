some ewdence that we can use.

13:45.200 --> 13:48.283
- Remove a body
from a crime scene?
- [Brakes Squea/ing ]

13:48.370 --> 13:50.406
That would be a very bad idea.

13:50.497 --> 13:52.408
Step away from the car, please.

13:52.499 --> 13:54.831
[ Hodgins ]
Agent Pero tta.

14:04.136 --> 14:07.799
took, the water rises up far enough, we’ll
be able to get to that door and open it.

14:07.889 --> 14:10.380
The room isn ’t fill/ng up
quickly enough for you already?

14:10.475 --> 14:12.431
[Groans]

14:14.771 --> 14:16.807
[Siren Blares]
You were here
for an interview?

14:16.898 --> 14:20.061
Mr. l/ega was writ/ng
Surviving the Gravedigger.
He wanted to talk to us.

14:20.193 --> 14:23.185
At 5:00 in the morning?
It was a... breakfast meeting.

14:23.321 --> 14:27.155
Were you following us, Agent Perotta?
Yes, Dr. Brennan, l was.

14:27.242 --> 14:29.324
You two are both suspected
of stealing evidence.

14:29.411 --> 14:31.367
This doesn’t exactly
clear you ofsuspicion.

14:31.455 --> 14:33.537
Well, was he under surveillance?

14:33.623 --> 14:36.160
Because a fat lot of good
the FBI. did him.

14:36.251 --> 14:39.243
Well, it appears that he was
the one who had the evidence.

14:39.337 --> 14:42.170
- Are we free to go now?
- [Hodgins] Why not?

14:42.257 --> 14:44.589
They have us under surveillance.

14:44.676 --> 14:46.917
[Perotta]
I’ll be in touch.

14:49.014 --> 14:51.300
[Grunting]

14:56.271 --> 14:59.138
Tell you what. You were always the guy
to be with in a tough spot.

14:59.232 --> 15:02.224
You never said anything
like that, Sarge.
You mostlyjust grunted.

15:02.319 --> 15:03.855
Made me get coffee.

15:03.945 --> 15:06.277
So what makes you think
what’s behind that hatch...

15:06.364 --> 15:08.741
is gonna be any better
than the last thing we opened?

15:08.825 --> 15:11.988
I’ll tell you what.
I’m either gonna drown fast
or really, really slow.

15:15.499 --> 15:17.239
Okay.

15:17.334 --> 15:19.290
Com/n ’ up pretty fast
here, Sarge.

15:19.377 --> 15:21.868
[ Hodgins]
Vega’s dead.
Oh, God. Vega’s dead.

15:21.963 --> 15:23.874
Right. Like murdered dead?

15:23.965 --> 15:26.627
We had no opportunity
to examine the remains...

15:26.718 --> 15:29.676
- before the F.B.l. interrupted us.
- Whoa. What? F.B.l.?

15:29.763 --> 15:31.799
[ Hodgins ]
Yep. F. B /.
Special Agent Pero tta.

15:31.890 --> 15:34.222
We ’re going to swing by,
pick up the evidence,

15:34.351 --> 15:36.637
and deliver it
to the Gravedigger.
What? Whoa, whoa, whoa.

15:36.728 --> 15:40.141
-Just do what he wants?
- We have no other choice.
You spoke to the F.B.l.

15:40.232 --> 15:42.723
[ Hodgins ]
We d/dn ’t talk to the FBI.
They talked to us.

15:42.818 --> 15:45.560
Somehow I don’t think
the Gravedigger’s gonna
take that into consideration.

15:45.654 --> 15:49.613
We still have time
to catch the Gravedigger
and to save Booth.

15:49.741 --> 15:51.197
The odds
are not acceptable.
Why?

15:51.326 --> 15:53.487
Because we don’t
have Booth to help.
[Saroyan ] let’s be clear here.

15:53.620 --> 15:58.239
What we intend to do next
constitutes felony conspiracy.
[Brennan] Not you.

15:58.375 --> 16:01.492
Me. I can do it alone.
No. No.

16:01.586 --> 16:05.579
Nobody does anything alone.
Vega was alone.

16:07.384 --> 16:09.670
[Gasping]

16:12.180 --> 16:15.638
- [Grunts]
- What the hell’s
that supposed to be for?

16:15.725 --> 16:18.137
It’s a fulcrum, Sarge.

16:18.228 --> 16:20.219
We, uh—
We’ll both work it together.

16:21.690 --> 16:23.772
There.
Right there. Ready?

16:23.859 --> 16:25.941
[Grunting]
Oh, God.

16:26.069 --> 16:27.605
[Metal Groaning]
God!

16:27.696 --> 16:30.438
[Grunting]

16:30.532 --> 16:32.614
[Both Grunting]

16:34.953 --> 16:36.944
There it is.
There we go.

16:37.038 --> 16:39.450
- All right, get in.
- Hey, real people
go first, Sarge.

16:39.541 --> 16:41.577
Get in before
I change my mind,
will you?

16:46.339 --> 16:48.250
[Hinge Groaning]

16:58.268 --> 17:00.224
Okay.

17:05.442 --> 17:07.353
Hey.

17:07.444 --> 17:09.309
Hey. Whoa. Okay.

17:09.446 --> 17:11.437
Get a— Get a grip, Sarge.
Hey.

17:11.573 --> 17:14.315
You’re attacking
your own hallucination.
You are not an hallucination.

17:14.409 --> 17:17.151
You helped me open that hatch.
I wouldn’t have been able to
open up that hatch without you.

17:17.245 --> 17:20.032
OMyOMy
So what does that make me?

17:20.123 --> 17:22.330
You are a ghost.

17:22.417 --> 17:25.250
I’m a ghost?

17:25.337 --> 17:27.453
Hey, why aren’t you scared?

17:27.547 --> 17:30.584
[Hull C reaking ]

17:30.675 --> 17:34.167
You being a ghost is not even
on the list ofthings that scare me.

17:39.976 --> 17:42.092
[ G ru nts ]
/kept tel/mg you.

17:42.187 --> 17:45.270
I said, “Learn to pick a lock.”
You remember your response,
Sarge?

17:45.357 --> 17:48.849
Yeah. “Any lock worth picking
is worth kicking.”

17:48.944 --> 17:52.107
- And I still stand by it.
- Well, hey, please, stand by it.

17:52.197 --> 17:55.530
Advice like that, it’s a miracle
I lived as long as I did.

17:55.617 --> 17:57.528
- You got a cuff link?
- Yeah.

18:00.205 --> 18:02.321
[Laughs]

18:06.336 --> 18:08.827
Twenty.
What’s that?

18:11.383 --> 18:12.919
You were 20 years old
when you died.

18:13.009 --> 18:14.795
Still am.

18:14.886 --> 18:18.174
You, Sarge—
Gotta say you’ve, uh,
put a couple years on.

18:18.265 --> 18:20.176
Hey, is it true that
the 30s is when...

18:20.267 --> 18:22.804
your body really starts
going south on you?

18:22.936 --> 18:26.645
Hey, you got any kids, Sarge?
Yeah. I got a boy.

18:27.691 --> 18:29.682
What’s his name?

18:30.944 --> 18:32.855
Aw, you’re probably
gonna take this wrong.

18:32.946 --> 18:34.857
Why? What’d you do?

18:34.948 --> 18:37.189
You name him something stupid
like— like Cutter?

18:38.201 --> 18:41.318
What, Tanner? Brady?

18:41.413 --> 18:43.870
Oh, God. You didn’t
name him Sebastian?

18:47.585 --> 18:51.203
Parker

18:52.299 --> 18:54.381
I named him Parker.

18:55.427 --> 18:57.839
That’s my name.

18:58.888 --> 19:01.015
It’s your last name.

19:01.099 --> 19:03.966
You know, and your
lock-picking sucks.

19:04.060 --> 19:06.437
You named your kid after me?

19:06.521 --> 19:09.479
Yeah.
What’s he l/ke?

19:09.566 --> 19:13.184
He’s, uh— He’sjust like
a kid, you know?
But he’s even better.

19:13.320 --> 19:15.026
Does he like you?
Of course he likes me.

19:15.113 --> 19:18.196
He loves me.
I’m his dad, you know?
He even got me this watch.

19:18.325 --> 19:21.112
What about his mom?
Yeah, she, uh-

19:21.202 --> 19:23.488
She likes me.

19:23.580 --> 19:26.868
But, uh, she didn’t love me.

19:29.336 --> 19:32.373
- You loved herthough.
- Of course I loved her.

19:32.464 --> 19:34.500
I still do. ljust—

19:34.591 --> 19:36.502
| just don’t like her too well.

19:36.593 --> 19:38.549
Uh, you saw
I picked the lock, right?

19:44.559 --> 19:46.470
We’re on a ship.

19:46.561 --> 19:49.143
Uh, Sarge?
Yeah?

19:49.230 --> 19:53.394
This particular ship
ain’t gonna be ﬂoating
much longer.

19:56.780 --> 20:00.068
[Booth]
(-4 explosives.

20:11.461 --> 20:13.452
[Brennan]
There’s a boundary stone
through the clearing.

20:17.634 --> 20:21.343
This is weird.
S ometh/ng nearby is
broadcast/ng a wdeo s/gnal.

20:27.018 --> 20:29.430
There. A camera up in that tree.

20:29.521 --> 20:31.557
[Hodg/ns] That’s how
the Gra ved/gger will see that
we brought what he wants.

20:31.648 --> 20:34.685
I might be able to hack
into the camera’s
broadcast frequency.

20:34.776 --> 20:37.518
[ Exhales]
I gotta say it doesn’t seem
to be the smartest move...

20:37.612 --> 20:40.570
tojust hand over
this evidence.
We need to be rational.

20:40.657 --> 20:44.491
We should maximize the chances
to catch the Gravedigger,
not minimize them.

20:47.705 --> 20:50.868
Listen to me, Brennan.
Somebody you love is buried alive.

20:50.959 --> 20:53.120
You’re allowed to save them,
no matter how irrational.

20:53.253 --> 20:55.164
I don’t love Booth.
Yes, you do.

20:55.255 --> 20:57.496
So do |.
So do all of us.

20:57.590 --> 21:02.129
Just take my advice and hand
over the evidence and get Booth.

21:04.389 --> 21:07.756
Let’s do it.
Come on. Let’s do it.

21:07.851 --> 21:10.217
Watch your monitor.
Tell me ifanything
changes, okay?

21:10.311 --> 21:12.563
- By anything, you mean—
- Anything.

21:17.068 --> 21:20.151
- [ Beeping]
- Okay, I’m in.

21:20.238 --> 21:22.229
I’ve locked into
the video feed.

21:25.243 --> 21:27.450
I hate this guy.

21:27.537 --> 21:29.903
I mean, I really,
really hate him.

21:29.998 --> 21:32.910
lwill find you!

21:40.800 --> 21:43.837
[ Beepin g ]
[Sweets]
Whoa.

21:43.928 --> 21:46.670
- Did you do that?
- No. No.

21:46.764 --> 21:50.302
Uh, that’s the Gravedigger.
It’s the vial he’s after.

21:50.393 --> 21:52.349
God, and his receiver’s
within a 500-yard radius.

21:52.479 --> 21:55.721
He’s rea/Av close.
Oh, uh, Angela,

21:55.815 --> 21:58.192
this pointy bit here
just got way pointier.

21:58.276 --> 22:00.688
- At what frequency?
- 2.2 something.

22:00.778 --> 22:02.393
- Oh, my God.
- What?

22:02.489 --> 22:04.525
That signal’s not
coming from the camera.

22:04.616 --> 22:06.527
Get back!

22:06.618 --> 22:09.735
- Run. Run.
- Go, go.

22:09.829 --> 22:11.410
Go!

22:13.791 --> 22:16.533
[Both Groan]

22:16.628 --> 22:19.711
[ Brakes Screech]

22:19.797 --> 22:22.834
[Both Gasp]

22:22.926 --> 22:24.587
What the hell is going on here?

22:24.719 --> 22:26.630
You okay?
Yeah. Come on.

22:27.972 --> 22:31.009
We followed Dr. Brennan’s car
to the boundary stone.

22:31.100 --> 22:33.011
We arrived moments
after the explosion.

22:33.102 --> 22:35.764
- What the hell
were you people doing?
- We have nothing to say.

22:37.732 --> 22:41.566
We found ewdence at the crime
scene believed to be related to
the Gra vedigger investigation.

22:41.653 --> 22:44.645
/be/ieve they returned
ewdence to the Gra vedigger.

22:44.739 --> 22:47.230
Agent Perotta, you will deny
all ofthese people access
to this case.

22:47.325 --> 22:49.816
May | make a request,
Your Honor?

22:49.911 --> 22:51.867
I’d like to see
Thomas Vega’s remains.

22:51.996 --> 22:53.987
I need to examine them
immediately.
You Will examine nothing

22:54.082 --> 22:57.290
You people will stay away
from anything to do
with the Gravedigger.

23:07.178 --> 23:11.512
We’re on a ship
stuffed with toys
and explosives.

23:11.641 --> 23:14.053
And that makes some
kind of sense to you?
Yeah.

23:14.143 --> 23:16.725
What they do, Sarge,
is they sink ships for reefs.

23:16.813 --> 23:19.020
They get school kids
to do all the decorating.

23:19.148 --> 23:23.061
Why?
The fish. Why else?

23:23.152 --> 23:25.234
[Teddy]
Fish love decorations.

23:29.200 --> 23:31.111
There ’s a transponder.

23:31.202 --> 23:33.534
We have six hours
and 23 minutes here.

23:33.621 --> 23:35.998
- What? No ideas?
- According to you,
I’m already a ghost.

23:36.124 --> 23:38.331
As a result, I got
no sense of urgency.
Hang on.

23:38.418 --> 23:43.128
- Maybe we can use the
transponder to send a signal.
- But that’s the only fail-safe.

23:43.214 --> 23:46.706
Once you disconnect the
transponder, nothing can stop
the ship from b/o wing to hell...

23:46.801 --> 23:49.008
in siX hours and 2 2 minutes.

23:53.600 --> 23:55.807
Sense of urgency now?

23:55.893 --> 23:57.554
[Brennan]
It’s been almost two hours.

23:57.645 --> 23:59.761
Why hasn’t the Gravedigger
sent us Booth’s coordinates?

23:59.856 --> 24:02.438
I think we have to
accept that the Gravedigger
isn’t gonna release Booth.

24:02.567 --> 24:04.683
He’s cleaning up.
Cleaning up?

24:04.777 --> 24:06.688
Yeah.
He destroyed the evidence.

24:06.779 --> 24:08.861
Now he’s trying
to destroy everyone
who had gotten close to him—

24:08.948 --> 24:11.564
Vega, Agent Booth,
you and Hodgins.

24:11.659 --> 24:15.652
It’s over. Booth’s dead. It’s my fault.
We’re out ofoptions.

24:15.747 --> 24:18.079
No. No.
It’s not over.

24:18.166 --> 24:20.657
And I know exactly
who to ask for help.

24:27.925 --> 24:30.337
So what’s so important you
couldn’t tell me on the phone?

24:30.428 --> 24:32.589
Your brother
has been kidnapped
by the Gravedigger.

24:32.680 --> 24:34.716
Seeley’s been kidnapped?
VVhen?

24:34.807 --> 24:36.968
Booth will be dead
in six hours.

24:37.060 --> 24:40.393
What I need you to do is hijack
the remains ofa murder victim,

24:40.480 --> 24:42.391
and then bring them to me.

24:42.482 --> 24:45.519
I’m in military intelligence.
We don’t hijack dead bodies.

24:45.610 --> 24:48.192
The victim’s name
is Thomas Vega.

24:48.321 --> 24:51.813
You want me to steal the remains
ofa murder victim from the F.B.l.?
Yes.

24:51.949 --> 24:55.282
As soon as possible, please.
I can make a few calls.

24:55.370 --> 24:57.531
No. This is not a situation where
you make a few phone calls.

24:57.622 --> 25:00.955
That’s who I am, Tempe.
lam the guy who makes
a few calls.

25:01.042 --> 25:03.203
Booth has never
turned his back on you.

25:03.294 --> 25:06.457
You are a selfish coward,
and you never deserved him.

25:10.510 --> 25:15.425
We can feed
the transponder’s signal
through the ship ’5 antenna.

25:15.515 --> 25:17.426
Well, you taught me sometimes
you gotta stand and fight,

25:17.517 --> 25:19.758
and sometimes you gotta
run like hell for help.

25:26.109 --> 25:29.272
[ Booth ]
Hang on, Teddy.
Stay with me.

25:29.362 --> 25:32.604
Sarge? Sarge?

25:36.703 --> 25:39.911
We never should’ve gone
on that last mission.

25:44.836 --> 25:46.792
I mean—
[Exhales]

25:48.214 --> 25:51.047
taking out another sniper,
that was—

25:51.134 --> 25:53.591
That was way beyond
your capabilities.

25:53.678 --> 25:55.839
There was— You couldn’t-

25:55.930 --> 25:57.966
That’s why you’re haunting me, right?

25:58.057 --> 25:59.968
You’re—

26:01.436 --> 26:05.429
Can’t an old army buddyjust
show up to lend a helping hand?

26:09.193 --> 26:11.149
Yeah.

26:15.450 --> 26:18.567

to be saved by a squid.

38:24.094 --> 38:26.050
Brennan, they know
where Booth is.

38:26.138 --> 38:29.221
Jared is getting a helicopter
to take you there.

38:29.308 --> 38:31.264
He’s on an old navy ship.

38:39.818 --> 38:41.809
You can put me down,
Sarge.

38:41.904 --> 38:43.815
You don’t have
to carry me anymore.

that way, Teddy.

38:48.702 --> 38:51.114
I’m patched through
via cell phone.
Jared? Wh—

38:51.205 --> 38:53.617
I don’t understand.
Why aren’t you here
in the helicopter with me?

38:53.707 --> 38:55.698
Typical navy red tape.
Nothing to worry about.

38:55.792 --> 38:57.657
But listen, they couldn’t
cancel the detonation.

38:57.794 --> 39:00.456
Something’s wrong
with the transponder.
What do we do now?

39:00.547 --> 39:02.162
The ship blows
in nine minutes.

39:02.257 --> 39:04.248
The navy’s only given you five
to get there and get Seeley off.

39:04.343 --> 39:08.256
No.Jared, Booth could be
anywhere on that ship.
Five minutes is not enough time.

39:08.347 --> 39:11.054
These guys don’t negotiate, Tempe.
They won’t risk any more lives.

39:11.141 --> 39:14.099
- Are you all right?
- It’s all worth it as long
as you save my brother.

39:18.774 --> 39:21.356
Rangers lead the way,
Sarge.
That’s right.

what you did for me—

how far you carried me.

39:41.630 --> 39:44.246
Sarge?

39:44.341 --> 39:46.923
One more thing
I gotta tell you.

39:51.723 --> 39:54.635
No way you’re getting
the deposit back on that tux.

40:00.148 --> 40:03.356
Booth! Hurry. Come on.

40:07.322 --> 40:09.859
Hurry, Booth. Come on.

40:43.692 --> 40:45.603
Thanks for coming
to get me, Bones.

40:45.694 --> 40:47.810
You should’ve stayed
in the hospital another day.

40:47.904 --> 40:51.772
No, I didn’t mean
getting me out ofthe hospital.

40:51.867 --> 40:56.156
I meant coming out
on the helicopter to the ship.

40:56.246 --> 40:58.328

41:09.092 --> 41:11.208
That’s hard to ﬁnd

41:11.303 --> 41:13.589
I read through your report.

41:13.680 --> 41:17.172
Seems you would need two people
to do most of what you did.

41:19.186 --> 41:23.054
I had help. It was a ghost.

41:23.148 --> 41:25.480
You were injured,

41:25.567 --> 41:29.310
drugged, disoriented,
breathing bad air.

41:29.404 --> 41:31.486
There are no such things
as ghosts.

to tell yourselfthere, Bones.

Wasn’t my fault.

Her name is Claire.
