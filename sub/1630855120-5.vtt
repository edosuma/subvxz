02:59.820 --> 03:01.620
I wasn't planning
to have children

you'd be a terrible mother,

03:15.050 --> 03:17.720

you take that on board.

03:17.920 --> 03:21.420

I don't want kids,
and he says, "Okay."

- was she in my goddamn house?
- I don't know.

11:56.180 --> 11:57.200
Which means yes.

11:57.400 --> 11:58.110
- Right?
- Yeah, probably yes.

Probably yes.

- Fuck.

But did you tell Beth
about any of this?

12:02.660 --> 12:04.860
Yes. I told her I was worried
it was a possibility.

And?

12:06.450 --> 12:07.640
And she doesn't want

- We got to do something.
- Yeah, but first

that something is going to be.

Even if all this with Sophie
is unrelated,

12:19.200 --> 12:20.610

I mean, she's definitely
thinking about it.

12:23.080 --> 12:25.400

a handle on her.

anyone was home,

22:48.440 --> 22:49.680
I'm very sorry to hear that.

22:49.880 --> 22:51.420
Thank you.

22:51.620 --> 22:52.770
Still though, you're head
of Major Crimes Bureau.

22:52.970 --> 22:54.200
It's not even 10:00
in the morning.

22:54.400 --> 22:55.940
- Where the hell are you going?
- [sighs]

22:56.140 --> 22:58.250
You know what?
Fuck you for ambushing me.

22:58.450 --> 23:00.210
And fuck you for thinking
you know what my job is.

23:00.410 --> 23:01.990
You think it's a bunch of
ass kissing

23:02.190 --> 23:04.170
and handing out favors when
what it really is

23:04.370 --> 23:06.430
is catching bullshit cases
from bullshit detectives

23:06.630 --> 23:07.910
and trying to make something
out of them,

23:08.110 --> 23:09.820
which I can do
from fucking home.

23:11.780 --> 23:15.610
Hey. My deepest condolences.

23:22.530 --> 23:24.320
<i>DAN:</i>
<i>It's not a bad idea.</i>

23:24.520 --> 23:25.970
<i>MIKE [over phone]: Yeah, well,</i>
<i>it's not a good idea.</i>

23:26.170 --> 23:27.280
<i>Guy's at work</i>
<i>in the middle of the day,</i>

23:27.480 --> 23:28.630
<i>public-facing job.</i>

23:28.830 --> 23:29.720
<i>And suddenly here's you,</i>

23:29.920 --> 23:30.850
<i>even if he knows you got parole.</i>

23:31.050 --> 23:32.460
Well, yeah, that's the point.

23:32.660 --> 23:34.290
Surprise him so we get
an uncalibrated reaction.

23:34.490 --> 23:36.460
<i>Oh, you're gonna surprise him,</i>
<i>showing up saying</i>

23:36.660 --> 23:38.120
<i>he should be a suspect</i>
<i>in the murder</i>

23:38.320 --> 23:39.940
<i>you went to prison for.</i>

23:40.140 --> 23:41.900
<i>You might get an uncalibrated</i>
<i>punch in the mouth.</i>

23:42.100 --> 23:43.900
[chuckles]

23:44.100 --> 23:45.910
I'm not gonna accuse
the man of anything.

23:46.110 --> 23:47.870
I just want him to confirm
that he's the one

23:48.060 --> 23:50.170
that made the unofficial
complaint to Conchita

23:50.370 --> 23:51.520
so I can put it
in the application.

23:51.720 --> 23:53.220
<i>Tomato-tomato, Danny.</i>

23:53.420 --> 23:55.480
<i>But it can't be today,</i>
<i>or tomorrow, anyway.</i>

23:55.680 --> 23:58.180
<i>No, I'm in Pomona on a case.</i>
<i>I need to pay my bills.</i>

23:58.380 --> 24:00.090
<i>So you're gonna have to wait</i>
<i>to get punched</i>

24:00.290 --> 24:01.970
<i>- until I'm done.</i>
- Hold on one second.

24:02.170 --> 24:04.010
- Hey there, how's it going?
- Good, thank you.

24:04.210 --> 24:06.800
Good. Uh, this is awkward,

24:07.000 --> 24:09.670
but I need you to
go down to Central Court today

24:09.870 --> 24:11.110
to file some papers.

24:11.310 --> 24:12.890
Not awkward at all.
Happy to do it.

24:13.090 --> 24:15.940
Okay. Just the idea

24:16.140 --> 24:17.550
that I would ever be asking you

24:17.750 --> 24:19.200
- to go and...
- Jorge.

24:19.400 --> 24:22.240
I appreciate that,
but it's fine.

24:23.890 --> 24:25.600
Great.

24:25.800 --> 24:28.820
- So, could you do it soon?
- Absolutely.

24:29.020 --> 24:30.300
Stop by Suzanne, she's got
everything you need.

24:30.500 --> 24:31.770
Will do.

24:33.250 --> 24:34.220
- Still there?
<i>- MIKE: Yeah.</i>

24:34.420 --> 24:35.520
Looks like I'm gonna go see

24:35.720 --> 24:37.130
Gabriel without you today.

24:37.330 --> 24:39.210
<i>Like you weren't</i>
<i>going to anyway.</i>

24:47.610 --> 24:49.880
[muffled, distorted chatter]

24:50.080 --> 24:52.700
[sighs]

24:57.010 --> 24:59.190
Holy shit.

25:00.320 --> 25:03.720
Benny. Gabriel.

25:03.920 --> 25:06.340
How you guys doing?

25:06.530 --> 25:08.730
Dan Gallagher.

25:08.930 --> 25:12.300
Goddamn, this is crazy.

25:12.500 --> 25:13.950
How long you been out?

25:14.150 --> 25:15.730
Not long.

25:19.380 --> 25:20.830
Can I buy you a cup of coffee?

25:21.030 --> 25:22.790
Judge Curtis in conference now,

25:22.990 --> 25:25.830
so sorry, no time for a break.

25:26.030 --> 25:28.170
All right.
Can we talk, though?

25:37.750 --> 25:39.890
Look, I'm-I'm writing up

25:40.090 --> 25:41.720
- a new trial application.
- Okay.

25:41.920 --> 25:43.020
For who? For you?

25:43.220 --> 25:44.590
Yeah, yeah.

25:44.790 --> 25:46.770
And I found out that you filed
a grievance

25:46.970 --> 25:48.330
against Alex Forrest
before she died,

25:48.530 --> 25:49.770
and obviously,
if I would have known that,

25:49.970 --> 25:51.510
I would have brought it up
at my trial.

25:51.710 --> 25:53.990
Well, if you know, you know
it was unofficial, right?

25:54.190 --> 25:55.820
It wasn't formal.

25:56.020 --> 25:57.560
But it was important enough
to involve your union rep.

25:57.760 --> 26:00.080
That's right, because
that's what they're there for.

26:00.280 --> 26:02.390
They said get it on record,
get insurance,

26:02.590 --> 26:04.610
don't get fired off this woman
who can't take a hint.

26:04.810 --> 26:06.130
And you did exactly
the right thing.

26:06.330 --> 26:08.480
And thank you for being
so forthcoming.

26:08.680 --> 26:11.790
Um, look, I'm sorry.

26:11.990 --> 26:13.750
I didn't have time to
write up an affidavit

26:13.950 --> 26:16.360
before I got here, but now that
we've had a chance to talk,

26:16.560 --> 26:18.060
- maybe I can go draft one
and bring it back.
- Whoa.

26:18.260 --> 26:21.050
Why? I'm not signing shit
for you, dude.

26:25.270 --> 26:27.850
I did 15 years for
a crime I didn't commit.

26:28.050 --> 26:29.720
I'm just asking for your help.

26:29.920 --> 26:32.030
You want to hand my ass over
to a judge to rule on?

26:32.230 --> 26:33.730
[laughs]

26:33.930 --> 26:36.330
Why would I let you do that?

26:42.030 --> 26:45.170
Hey, you don't matter
in this building anymore,

26:45.370 --> 26:46.960
you entitled motherfucker.

26:47.160 --> 26:48.440
You want my help?

26:48.640 --> 26:50.470
Subpoena it.

27:01.660 --> 27:03.570
And you thought
he used to be cranky.

27:04.710 --> 27:07.890
Anyway,
it's good to see you, man.

27:08.090 --> 27:09.070
Is it?

27:09.270 --> 27:11.500
Yeah.

27:11.700 --> 27:13.770
Why wouldn't it be?

27:13.970 --> 27:15.290
I never thought
you killed anybody,

27:15.490 --> 27:18.900
and even if you did,
you still wouldn't be

27:19.100 --> 27:21.160
the worst person I've ever met.

27:24.120 --> 27:26.740
- But you don't?
- No.

27:26.940 --> 27:29.600
Not even with all the rumors.

27:31.340 --> 27:32.700
Can I buy you lunch?

27:32.900 --> 27:34.950
I could eat.

27:36.690 --> 27:40.400
On Fairfax, the Irish bar,
live music type place.

27:40.600 --> 27:44.670
Uh, you and some brunette that
they thought was a witness

27:44.870 --> 27:46.060
in that death penalty case.

27:46.260 --> 27:47.190
You know, the one
with the ranch hands

27:47.390 --> 27:48.150
who killed the guy's ex-wife.

27:48.350 --> 27:49.590
I've never been to a live

27:49.780 --> 27:50.980
Irish music place in my life.

27:51.180 --> 27:52.500
Well, I'm just saying
what was said.

27:52.700 --> 27:54.020
[snorts]

27:54.220 --> 27:56.810
And that you got a fuck pad
in Burbank.

27:57.010 --> 27:58.680
- Wow.
- A condo, or something
like that.

27:58.880 --> 28:00.070
[chuckles]

28:00.270 --> 28:01.680
That you were always
asking people

28:01.880 --> 28:02.900
- to go with you there
after work.
- Really?

28:03.100 --> 28:04.470
- Mm-hmm.
- What people?

28:04.670 --> 28:05.780
I mean, never whoever
was saying anything

28:05.970 --> 28:08.210
would ever say, but...

28:08.410 --> 28:11.300
Holy shit. Well...

28:11.500 --> 28:14.170
- Is there anything else?
- No.

28:14.370 --> 28:16.480
Well, yes.

28:16.680 --> 28:18.660
It's that hot chick in Records.

28:18.860 --> 28:20.790
She drove around in a Porsche,
and for some reason,

28:20.990 --> 28:23.440
people were saying that you
bought it for her,

28:23.640 --> 28:25.870
or leased it,
or whatever it was.

28:27.700 --> 28:29.410
Obviously, it was all bullshit.

28:29.610 --> 28:31.060
Yeah, Benny, I know.

28:31.260 --> 28:33.370
I'm aware I didn't have
a fuck pad in Burbank.

28:33.570 --> 28:35.590
[Benny laughs]

28:35.790 --> 28:37.550
She had a thing
for Gabe, though.

28:37.750 --> 28:40.280
Alex Forrest.

28:41.850 --> 28:44.290
He was always handing me off
all these awesome donuts

28:44.490 --> 28:46.560
that she'd bring for him.

28:46.750 --> 28:50.200
Never said anything, though.
Not till after.

28:53.160 --> 28:55.040
Hmm.

28:55.240 --> 28:56.480
And what about her?

28:56.680 --> 28:58.040
Can I get you another one? Good?

28:58.240 --> 28:59.440
- You ever hear any rumors
about her?
- No.

28:59.640 --> 29:01.180
But I did see her
on the fifth floor once.

29:01.380 --> 29:03.880
By the good vending machines.

29:04.080 --> 29:05.660
With the spicy trail mix.

29:05.860 --> 29:08.450
She was arguing with this guy.

29:08.650 --> 29:10.540
You know who it was?
Or you never knew?

29:10.730 --> 29:12.830
No, I've seen him around.

29:15.440 --> 29:17.240
I think he was in Legal Aid.

29:17.440 --> 29:18.760
Felt like I remember seeing him

29:18.960 --> 29:22.720
in the, uh, in the courtroom
with Ruth.

29:22.920 --> 29:26.510
Low-key guy. Blond hair.

29:26.710 --> 29:28.290
Griffin?

29:28.490 --> 29:31.340
Smith? Biff?

29:31.540 --> 29:33.560
I don't know, khakis.

29:33.760 --> 29:35.170
Man, this place still really
makes the shit

29:35.370 --> 29:36.990
out of some shrimp.

29:45.130 --> 29:46.820
[door closes]

29:53.050 --> 29:55.410
Why'd you come back?

29:55.610 --> 29:57.190
With everything that's going on,

29:57.390 --> 29:58.930
it's been a little hard
to focus at the office,

29:59.130 --> 30:01.370
so I'm gonna prep
from here this week.

30:01.570 --> 30:05.160
Marcella's okay with that?

30:05.350 --> 30:07.330
Yeah.

30:07.530 --> 30:10.380
So I can get Ellen from the bus.

30:10.580 --> 30:13.990
You can stay later at
the office, if that helps.

30:14.190 --> 30:15.720
Okay, thank you.

30:19.860 --> 30:22.780
It mostly helps because...

30:22.980 --> 30:25.600
I don't know how to be
in this house.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.570
[kids chattering]

30:40.620 --> 30:42.540
Hey, snicklefritz.

30:42.740 --> 30:43.980
Mom doesn't wait here.

30:44.180 --> 30:45.410
She waits at the driveway.

30:45.610 --> 30:46.980
I know that.

30:47.180 --> 30:48.810
- I cross by myself.
- Well, I know that,

30:49.010 --> 30:50.640
but I didn't come here because
I thought you needed me.

30:50.830 --> 30:52.420
I came here because
I needed you.

30:52.620 --> 30:54.550
I really wanted to
hold your hand today.

30:54.750 --> 30:56.210
And I might want to
hold your hand tomorrow.

30:56.410 --> 30:58.070
I'm not sure yet.

31:01.680 --> 31:03.030
Are you okay?

31:07.160 --> 31:10.130
Yeah, I'm doing all right now.
How about you?

31:10.330 --> 31:11.610
How you doing?

31:11.810 --> 31:13.520
I am if you are.

31:16.960 --> 31:18.790
<i>ADULT ELLEN:</i>
<i>Gin makes the blood vessels</i>
<i>in your face explode.</i>

31:18.990 --> 31:20.320
<i>DAN:</i>
<i>That's not true, actually.</i>

31:20.520 --> 31:22.010
You know, Grandpa Warren
would be very upset

31:22.210 --> 31:23.150
if he heard you say that.

31:23.350 --> 31:24.710
He always thought of himself as

31:24.910 --> 31:26.540
the global ambassador
for gin's good name.

31:26.740 --> 31:28.460
- What about bourbon?
- Bourbon is prunes.

31:28.660 --> 31:30.020
- What are you talking about?
- Southern Comfort, it's prunes.

31:30.220 --> 31:32.420
Southern Comfort is
hardly bourbon.

31:32.620 --> 31:34.720
And Southern Comfort is
not prunes. That's Dr. Pepper.

31:34.920 --> 31:36.810
And Dr. Pepper isn't prunes
either, so...

31:37.010 --> 31:38.990
So just beer and wine, then?

31:39.190 --> 31:41.380
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, me too, mostly.

31:41.580 --> 31:43.040
Though there was
a long time there

31:43.240 --> 31:45.600
where I was daydreaming
about Bloody Marys,

31:45.800 --> 31:47.170
which were never really
my thing.

31:47.370 --> 31:48.260
Yeah, it's Mike's thing.

31:48.460 --> 31:50.560
Yeah, that's why.

31:50.760 --> 31:52.610
All those years watching him
knock 'em back,

31:52.810 --> 31:55.530
it symbolized being
out in the world, I guess.

31:55.730 --> 31:57.570
Mm.

31:57.770 --> 32:00.620
But now I'm here,
and all I really want

32:00.820 --> 32:02.570
is a beer.

32:09.010 --> 32:10.760
Oh, man, that's good.

32:10.960 --> 32:12.360
[chuckles]

32:19.890 --> 32:21.160
This is really nice.

32:21.360 --> 32:23.160
And a real head trip.

32:23.360 --> 32:27.040
[exhales sharply]
After...

32:27.240 --> 32:28.990
missing all those years,

32:29.190 --> 32:31.520
to sit here and feel like
I know you,

32:31.720 --> 32:34.300
but to know less about you

32:34.500 --> 32:36.480
than somebody who
barely knows you.

32:36.680 --> 32:39.220
What other people think of
as other people

32:39.420 --> 32:43.090
is really just a projection
of themselves anyway.

32:45.610 --> 32:48.180
What do you want to know?

32:54.580 --> 32:56.810
If it's already built,

32:57.000 --> 32:58.670
why do they call it a building?

33:02.410 --> 33:03.900
Why are they called "apartments"

33:04.100 --> 33:06.070
if they're so close together?

33:12.860 --> 33:14.680
What was it about her?

33:22.690 --> 33:24.950
[Dan sighs]

33:26.220 --> 33:29.050
I don't think it was
actually about her.

33:32.830 --> 33:35.840
Which makes me feel sick
to my stomach to say.

33:36.040 --> 33:39.720
But when I try to remember
what I was feeling

33:39.920 --> 33:41.150
when all that was happening,

33:41.350 --> 33:43.850
mostly I just remember
being afraid.

33:44.050 --> 33:46.460
Of what?

33:46.660 --> 33:49.470
That life had passed me by,
and I didn't even notice.

33:49.670 --> 33:51.730
Hmm.

33:51.930 --> 33:54.990
You're the psychology major...
[clears throat]

33:55.190 --> 33:58.210
and the Jung scholar.

33:58.410 --> 33:59.650
Pretty sure you'd have
a lot more insight

33:59.850 --> 34:00.780
into that than I do.

34:00.980 --> 34:02.650
Well, Mom always said that

34:02.850 --> 34:04.350
your father never
believed in you.

34:04.550 --> 34:06.440
And if that was true,
then you're never gonna think

34:06.640 --> 34:07.880
that you're good enough.

34:08.080 --> 34:10.310
Even if consciously,
on the outside,

34:10.510 --> 34:12.490
you're pushing back, you're
fighting against that idea,

34:12.690 --> 34:15.880
on the inside you're always
just gonna be waiting to fail

34:16.080 --> 34:17.150
because deep down
you really think that

34:17.350 --> 34:18.760
failure is your destiny.

34:18.960 --> 34:22.280
So maybe when you did fail,

34:22.480 --> 34:24.020
when you didn't get to
become a judge,

34:24.220 --> 34:26.070
you just decided to stop
fighting the part of yourself

34:26.270 --> 34:27.770
that secretly thought
that you were worthless,

34:27.960 --> 34:32.240
and instead, just do
something to prove it.

34:38.460 --> 34:40.070
Sorry.

34:42.030 --> 34:43.640
Don't be sorry.

34:45.860 --> 34:47.650
I asked.

34:47.850 --> 34:49.700

<i>Can you tell me how</i>
<i>you know Danny Gallagher?</i>

34:56.080 --> 35:00.410
Uh, I was assigned
to a case of his

35:00.610 --> 35:03.240
in sentencing phase
is how I met him.

35:03.440 --> 35:06.670
And then I got assigned to
another pending case of his

35:06.870 --> 35:08.110
that didn't go.

35:08.310 --> 35:10.590
I have a witness
who places you with him

35:10.790 --> 35:13.680
at Andolini's Restaurant
on the ninth last month,

35:13.880 --> 35:15.120
which was a Friday.

35:15.320 --> 35:18.420
- You remember that night?
- Yeah, actually.

35:18.620 --> 35:20.640
- Can you tell me
what it was like?
- What it was like?

35:20.840 --> 35:23.430
Um, that sounds kind of loaded.

35:23.630 --> 35:26.260
It isn't meant to,
it's just meant to be

35:26.460 --> 35:30.480
open enough to include whatever
you might want to tell me.

35:30.680 --> 35:34.040
I want to tell you everything.

35:37.000 --> 35:38.710
<i>I haven't lived here very long,</i>

35:38.910 --> 35:42.230

that many people.

35:42.430 --> 35:45.500
I work most of the time, so...

35:45.690 --> 35:47.760
so I was having dinner
at the bar,

35:47.960 --> 35:51.720
and he was there
meeting somebody.

35:51.920 --> 35:54.500
A colleague, I think.

35:54.700 --> 35:58.730
And we just struck up
a conversation.

35:58.930 --> 36:01.900
About work, but more...

36:02.100 --> 36:04.300
more our philosophy of work.

36:04.500 --> 36:07.160
You know, conceptualizing
what we do.

36:08.990 --> 36:10.520
Also, our parents.

36:10.720 --> 36:13.090
Um, our fathers.

36:13.290 --> 36:16.210
His father was a judge.

36:18.300 --> 36:22.960
I don't know, just
good conversation.

36:25.050 --> 36:28.050
I don't really have
many of those.

36:29.180 --> 36:31.930
He made me...

36:32.130 --> 36:35.490
He made me wish that
I had more friends.

36:38.370 --> 36:40.330
Conchita's al--
Sorry, my boss is...

36:40.530 --> 36:43.550
- That's okay. I love Conchita.
- She's always saying

36:43.750 --> 36:46.210
that Dan Gallagher,
he's one of the good guys.

36:46.410 --> 36:51.250
And... I felt like
that night I saw why.

36:56.950 --> 36:59.050
You're cleared, it's done.

36:59.250 --> 37:00.830
I still need to
fill Marcella in,

37:01.030 --> 37:03.830
but as far as I'm concerned,
the letter, the allegation

37:04.030 --> 37:05.750
in the letter is unfounded.

37:05.950 --> 37:09.140
Okay, so that's it?

37:09.340 --> 37:10.580
Yep. Back to work.

37:10.780 --> 37:11.710
Although maybe let Marcella
be the one

37:11.910 --> 37:12.580
to officially tell you that.

37:12.780 --> 37:15.020
Uh, thank you.

37:15.220 --> 37:17.850
You should thank
your friend Alex.

37:18.050 --> 37:20.490
She's the one who
saved your ass.

37:25.370 --> 37:28.420

37:44.070 --> 37:45.090
- Get you some water?
- No, I'm fine.

37:45.290 --> 37:46.920

37:47.120 --> 37:48.790

37:48.990 --> 37:51.140
I'm good. Just a little, um...

37:51.340 --> 37:52.740
A little pregnant.

37:54.220 --> 37:56.310
But shh.

38:05.800 --> 38:07.160
You better gird your loins,

38:07.360 --> 38:09.330
because we have to
go over your schedule.

38:09.530 --> 38:13.080
Okay. That's fine.

38:13.280 --> 38:14.690
Just glad to be back.

38:14.890 --> 38:16.640

You don't look all that
surprised, Mike.

38:38.080 --> 38:40.190
I don't think I am anymore.

38:40.390 --> 38:42.150
- Okay, so what are you?
- I'm your friend,

38:42.350 --> 38:44.460
who's trying to
look at this objectively.

38:44.660 --> 38:46.370
And I think this woman is--

38:46.570 --> 38:50.550
she is telling herself
a story about you.

38:50.750 --> 38:53.540
- Clearly.
- One that you helped her write.

38:55.070 --> 38:56.690

38:56.890 --> 38:58.170

if you just bent this
Alex woman over

39:00.060 --> 39:01.600
a bathroom sink one night,
never spoke to her again,

39:01.800 --> 39:02.950
this could all still
be happening.

39:03.150 --> 39:04.650
Right, 'cause she's
out of her mind.

39:04.850 --> 39:06.000
Well, maybe so,
but that's not what you did

39:06.200 --> 39:07.830
because that's not
what you do, Dan.

39:08.030 --> 39:09.790
Mike...

39:09.990 --> 39:11.880
I've never cheated
on Beth before.

39:12.070 --> 39:13.310

to like you.

39:13.510 --> 39:16.580
Not just juries,
but fucking everybody.

39:16.780 --> 39:19.270

You put on "The Dan Show,"
it's what you do.

39:22.480 --> 39:23.630
But this woman is the one
who's supposed to

39:23.830 --> 39:24.890
somehow know you didn't mean it?

39:25.090 --> 39:26.890
What is this?

39:27.090 --> 39:30.020
I didn't-- Hey,
I didn't say anything,

39:30.220 --> 39:33.110
I didn't do anything
that would justify...

39:33.310 --> 39:35.420
No, it's how she heard
what you said that matters.

39:35.620 --> 39:37.510
She's building a world
in her fucking head

39:37.710 --> 39:39.380
about something you did
because you were mad

39:39.580 --> 39:41.560
you were gonna have to wait
to be a fucking judge, man.

39:41.760 --> 39:44.080
You know, the next time
you're disappointed,

39:44.280 --> 39:45.820
why don't you just try
to sit with that feeling,

40:08.260 --> 40:09.410
What's it like

for you to do your thesis
about Jungian shit.

trusted me with this.

40:53.390 --> 40:54.930
Yeah, you do seem very boring.

40:55.130 --> 40:57.070
- Very.
- Yeah.

ever been on probation?

41:05.140 --> 41:08.170
I mean, not specifically,
but yeah.

41:08.360 --> 41:11.390
Well, I have been on probation.
