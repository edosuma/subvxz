00:02.650 --> 00:04.490
<i>Previously on</i>
Fatal Attraction...

00:04.690 --> 00:06.180
- You should stay.
- I didn't think that this
is what we were doing.

00:06.380 --> 00:07.230
<i>- I'm sorry.</i>
<i>- ALEX: I can't let you pretend</i>

00:07.430 --> 00:08.660
<i>like I don't exist.</i>

00:08.860 --> 00:10.540
And I'm not going to be
ignored, Dan.

00:10.740 --> 00:12.410
<i>MIKE:</i>
<i>Why is she throwing acid</i>
<i>on your car?</i>

00:12.610 --> 00:13.890
I thought I had this handled,
then she shows up

00:14.090 --> 00:15.760
<i>in my fucking home.</i>

00:15.960 --> 00:17.890
- Hi.
<i>- DAN: I don't know what</i>
<i>you think you're doing,</i>

00:18.090 --> 00:20.070
- but it's going to stop.
- It's not going to st--
Why would it stop?

00:20.270 --> 00:22.330
I received an unofficial
complaint about Alex.

00:22.530 --> 00:23.900
Gabriel Ibarra. He had

00:24.100 --> 00:25.250
<i>rejected her.</i>
<i>She had backed off,</i>

00:25.450 --> 00:26.730
<i>but only sort of.</i>

00:26.930 --> 00:28.380
Earl's been working it
for six months,

00:28.580 --> 00:30.080
- and it's definitely a pattern.
- Against women.

00:30.280 --> 00:31.600
A pattern against women.

00:31.800 --> 00:34.170
Patterns are historically
Major Crimes Bureau.

00:34.370 --> 00:35.820
Because, "historically,"

00:36.020 --> 00:37.350
the Crimes Against Women Bureau
didn't exist.

00:37.550 --> 00:39.000
Gas and electric will be here.
When they leave,

00:39.200 --> 00:40.480
<i>you need to close the gate</i>
<i>and lock it.</i>

00:40.680 --> 00:43.000
<i>Then you may take Quincy out.</i>

00:43.200 --> 00:44.960
<i>DAN:</i>
<i>The gate was closed.</i>

00:45.160 --> 00:47.180
I just don't understand why
your mom would close the gate

00:47.380 --> 00:48.780
if she didn't know
where Quincy was.

00:50.130 --> 00:53.000
<i>DAN:</i>
<i>She was here.</i>

01:06.540 --> 01:08.240
MAN:
Let's wrap it up.

01:12.070 --> 01:14.460
[truck departing]

01:17.640 --> 01:19.390
[Quincy barks]

01:19.590 --> 01:21.960
Ah. Stay.

01:22.150 --> 01:23.220
SOPHIE:
Quincy, come.

01:23.420 --> 01:25.960
Oh... Oh.

01:26.160 --> 01:27.350
Who closed the gate?

01:27.550 --> 01:30.360
- Uh...
- Oh,

01:30.550 --> 01:32.230
thank Christ. Holy shit.

01:32.430 --> 01:34.450
If you hadn't,
that would've been it for me.

01:34.650 --> 01:36.750
It's the whole reason I'm here.

01:36.950 --> 01:38.410
And that dog
would've been gone forever,

01:38.610 --> 01:41.540
and my daughter would've
stuffed me down a storm drain.

01:41.740 --> 01:44.020
[laughs] Thank God for you. Wow.

01:44.220 --> 01:47.110
No, thank God,
thank God I saw him.

01:47.310 --> 01:48.850
I was just going to my house.

01:49.050 --> 01:52.380
The... blue colonial
with the-the porch.

01:52.580 --> 01:53.730
Huh.

01:53.930 --> 01:57.380
Uh, and I just, he was suddenly

01:57.580 --> 01:59.340
running towards me, and-and

01:59.540 --> 02:00.990
people drive so quickly
on this street.

02:01.190 --> 02:03.130
I'm-I'm just...
I'm glad I caught him.

02:03.330 --> 02:05.130
- I'm glad I didn't overstep.
- Oh, can I

02:05.330 --> 02:06.260
make you a...

02:06.460 --> 02:08.090
coffee of gratitude?

02:08.290 --> 02:11.660
Um, or-or do you have to go?

02:11.860 --> 02:13.790
Uh...

02:13.990 --> 02:17.710
No, I-I could use
a-a gratitude coffee.

02:17.910 --> 02:20.670
Great. Or maybe something
a little stronger.

02:20.870 --> 02:22.790
Or is that just me?

02:25.310 --> 02:28.890
No. No, it's not just you.

02:29.090 --> 02:32.320
Okay. [laughs]

02:37.280 --> 02:41.470
Your daughter's
a contractor, right?

02:41.670 --> 02:43.430
She-she has a business?

02:43.630 --> 02:45.950
With her best friend
from grad school, yeah.

02:46.150 --> 02:47.910
Sh-She's at work right now?

02:48.110 --> 02:49.480
No, actually, she and my husband

02:49.680 --> 02:51.780
went down to the antique mall
in Sherman Oaks.

02:51.980 --> 02:53.960
Oh.

02:54.160 --> 02:56.880
- Do you have any other children?
- No, just Bethie.

02:57.080 --> 02:58.100
When I got married,

02:58.290 --> 02:59.620
my mother told me she hoped

02:59.820 --> 03:01.620
I wasn't planning
to have children

03:01.820 --> 03:04.750
because she was worried I
wouldn't do well with maternity.

03:04.950 --> 03:07.670
Really? How old were you?

03:07.870 --> 03:09.320
I was just 20.

03:09.520 --> 03:11.720
You know, I hadn't really
thought about it, but

03:11.920 --> 03:14.850
then your mother tells you
you'd be a terrible mother,

03:15.050 --> 03:17.720
so, you know,
you take that on board.

03:17.920 --> 03:21.420
[laughs] So, I told my husband

03:21.620 --> 03:23.900
I don't want kids,
and he says, "Okay."

03:24.100 --> 03:25.820
But then, a few years went by,

03:26.020 --> 03:28.780
and, one day,
Warren came home, and I said,

03:28.980 --> 03:30.560
"What if we had a baby?

03:30.760 --> 03:33.830
What if, you know,
my mom was wrong about me?"

03:34.030 --> 03:36.000
And he just laughed. [laughs]

03:36.200 --> 03:37.960
He laughed and laughed.

03:38.160 --> 03:40.050
But was...

03:40.250 --> 03:41.530
Was she wrong?

03:41.730 --> 03:43.270
Well, I don't know.

03:43.470 --> 03:46.320
Maybe not about how terrible
a mother I was, but

03:46.520 --> 03:48.450
wrong about how much

03:48.650 --> 03:50.570
I was gonna love Bethie.

03:53.180 --> 03:54.670
- That's nice.
- Yeah.

03:54.870 --> 03:56.680
She and her father
are best friends.

03:56.870 --> 03:58.200
They're like the same person.

03:58.400 --> 04:01.590
I sometimes wonder,
if I just disappeared,

04:01.790 --> 04:03.030
how long it would
take them to notice

04:03.230 --> 04:06.080
I was gone. [laughs]

04:06.280 --> 04:08.600
You know,
Bethie designed this house.

04:08.800 --> 04:11.120
I mean, it's

04:11.320 --> 04:14.260
beautiful.
It's objectively beautiful.

04:14.460 --> 04:17.000
But all these bells
and whistles now,

04:17.200 --> 04:18.830
I-I just have to laugh.

04:19.030 --> 04:20.740
[voice fading]:
I mean, the-the dimmer switches

04:20.940 --> 04:22.960
and the butler pantry...

04:23.160 --> 04:24.790
[Sophie continues speaking
indistinctly]

04:24.990 --> 04:27.750
...water features.
They have this motorized

04:27.950 --> 04:29.190
pool cover.

04:29.390 --> 04:31.100
All they ever do is argue about

04:31.300 --> 04:33.970
whose turn it is to close it.

04:34.170 --> 04:36.450
- Whose turn is it?
- Who knows?

04:36.650 --> 04:39.670
It's a tale as old as time.

04:39.870 --> 04:42.550
[gasps] We should close it

04:42.750 --> 04:45.850
and let them each think
the other one did it.

04:46.050 --> 04:47.770
<i>Gift of the Magi.</i>

04:47.970 --> 04:51.080
Come with me. I never can figure
out how to work these things.

04:51.280 --> 04:53.770
I might need your wise counsel.

05:06.560 --> 05:07.880
[pool cover whirring]

05:08.080 --> 05:09.440
Oh, for the love of God,

05:09.640 --> 05:11.010
can you believe this? Look.

05:11.210 --> 05:12.750
All you have to do

05:12.950 --> 05:15.280
is literally
hold this button down.

05:15.480 --> 05:16.760
I mean...

05:16.950 --> 05:18.540
Oh, shit, I forgot that floatie.

05:18.740 --> 05:21.190
I probably need to get that
out of there, don't I?

05:21.390 --> 05:22.980
It's gonna make a big lump?

05:23.180 --> 05:24.940
I'll get it.

05:25.140 --> 05:26.970
[mutters]

05:28.580 --> 05:31.900
You know what? I should make us
some stuffed mushrooms.

05:32.100 --> 05:35.250
Oh, my God. They're just
those frozen ones, you know?

05:35.450 --> 05:36.950
[voice fading]:
From, uh, from whatsit?

05:37.150 --> 05:38.600
But, oh, they're amazing.

05:38.800 --> 05:40.770
Have you ever had them?

05:48.690 --> 05:50.790
[screams]

05:50.990 --> 05:51.920
[coughs]

05:52.120 --> 05:55.140
Oh, that was really silly.

05:55.340 --> 05:57.100
Ugh. Oh.

05:57.300 --> 05:59.360
- [coughs] Could you...
- [water splashing]

05:59.560 --> 06:00.970
Can you give me a hand?
I... [coughs]

06:01.170 --> 06:04.880
I'm not the best swimmer.
[coughing]

06:06.800 --> 06:08.500
Please!

06:08.700 --> 06:11.070
Can you... [labored breathing]
Can you hurry?

06:11.270 --> 06:13.770
Ugh. Wait. What are you doing?

06:13.970 --> 06:15.550
What are you doing?

06:15.750 --> 06:17.150
[screams]

06:18.200 --> 06:19.910
[water thrashing]

06:20.100 --> 06:22.590
[muffled screaming]

06:24.420 --> 06:25.820
[muffled coughing]

06:54.800 --> 06:56.890
â™ª

07:23.480 --> 07:25.790
Quincy. Here you go, buddy.
You're free.

07:34.620 --> 07:37.640
<i>DAN:</i>
<i>I slept with somebody else.</i>
<i>Someone...</i>

07:37.830 --> 07:40.110
- Uh...
- The one with the curly hair.

07:47.370 --> 07:49.860
[sighs] It's over now.

07:50.060 --> 07:51.130
- It's done.
- It's over?

07:51.330 --> 07:52.610
- It was a relationship?
- No.

07:52.810 --> 07:54.040
- Just a fuck?
- No. That's not what I was

07:54.240 --> 07:55.740
- trying to...
- More to it than fucking.

07:55.940 --> 07:56.780
I was trying to say that
it happened more than once.

07:56.980 --> 07:58.310
- That you fucked?
- Beth.

07:58.510 --> 08:00.480
Please, can you just
let me get this out?

08:00.680 --> 08:03.970
So, I have to hear it and you
get to decide how to tell me?

08:04.170 --> 08:05.710
Beth...

08:05.910 --> 08:08.750
You fucked someone else
more than once,

08:08.950 --> 08:11.230
- and now, it's over?
- Yes.

08:11.430 --> 08:13.150
I am so sorry.

08:13.350 --> 08:15.530
Why tonight?

08:17.840 --> 08:20.900
Why did I have to
be told tonight?

08:21.100 --> 08:23.200
Is it like a strategy?
Pile it all on,

08:23.400 --> 08:26.120
see how she reacts?

08:26.320 --> 08:28.340
[sighs]

08:28.540 --> 08:31.810
Was there really an emergency
at the jail that time?

08:34.330 --> 08:37.170
Why'd you have the cleaners
come ahead of schedule?

08:37.370 --> 08:38.830
That was not...

08:39.030 --> 08:41.350
That-that was...
Quincy actually got sick.

08:41.550 --> 08:43.790
That was not anything
to do with...

08:43.990 --> 08:45.620
How many times
is "more than once"?

08:45.820 --> 08:46.920
Four times.

08:47.120 --> 08:48.790
Ever in our house?

08:48.990 --> 08:51.140
- No. No, Beth.
- "No, Beth.

08:51.340 --> 08:54.700
No, I would never
do that to you."

08:57.140 --> 08:58.930
[clears throat]

08:59.130 --> 09:01.240
- When did it start?
- When you were away

09:01.440 --> 09:02.760
on the camping trip.

09:02.960 --> 09:05.510
You guys go to her place?

09:05.710 --> 09:07.030
Yes.

09:07.230 --> 09:09.340
And one time in the office.

09:09.530 --> 09:11.250
Does everyone there know?

09:11.450 --> 09:14.590
Does Mike know? Of course
your fucking fixer knows.

09:16.200 --> 09:18.340
You brought Quincy to her place?

09:18.540 --> 09:20.690
[sighs]

09:20.890 --> 09:22.740
Yes.

09:22.940 --> 09:24.260
Wow.

09:24.460 --> 09:26.350
- How did you know that?
- Quincy's mine.

09:26.550 --> 09:28.140
You gave me Quincy
for Christmas.

09:28.340 --> 09:30.570
Beth. Beth.

09:33.570 --> 09:35.670
Beth, I think
she was in our house.

09:35.870 --> 09:38.320
- What?
- I think that she was here.

09:38.520 --> 09:40.410
I don't know why she came.

09:40.610 --> 09:43.370
If it was to break something
or to steal something, but

09:43.570 --> 09:46.020
she is not a stable person.

09:47.410 --> 09:49.420
Right now, she is very angry

09:49.620 --> 09:52.600
that things did not turn out
the way that she wanted them to.

09:52.800 --> 09:54.420
And what?

09:54.620 --> 09:56.950
And I'm wondering
if maybe your mother

09:57.150 --> 09:58.380
surprised her,

09:58.580 --> 10:00.340
- maybe confronted her.
- What?

10:00.540 --> 10:03.000
I mean, are you... I...

10:03.200 --> 10:04.520
Do you hear yourself?

10:04.720 --> 10:06.650
I know how it sounds,

10:06.850 --> 10:08.660
but for our safety,

10:08.860 --> 10:09.870
all of our safety,

10:10.070 --> 10:11.570
we have to behave as though

10:11.770 --> 10:14.130
that's what happened
until we know that it didn't.

10:16.350 --> 10:18.230
'Cause this woman
is so obsessed with you

10:18.430 --> 10:19.970
she killed your mother-in-law,

10:20.170 --> 10:21.800
- that's what you think?
- I think it's possible.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.710
Yes.

10:23.910 --> 10:25.970
[laughs]

10:31.670 --> 10:32.980
[sniffles]

10:34.800 --> 10:36.940
So...

10:37.140 --> 10:39.690
I think this is probably it
for us, Dan.

10:39.890 --> 10:42.780
Do you realize that?

10:42.980 --> 10:46.130
I mean, I can't
take all this in.

10:46.330 --> 10:49.040
I think we're probably
already done.

10:49.240 --> 10:52.610
So, when my dad goes back
to his house in the morning,

10:52.810 --> 10:55.560
Ellen and I will go with him,
and we'll help him.

10:57.830 --> 10:59.580
[sniffles]

10:59.780 --> 11:01.060
And stay there.

11:01.260 --> 11:04.060
Don't come upstairs, okay?

11:04.260 --> 11:06.100
- Beth, can you just
hold on a sec...
- No.

11:06.300 --> 11:08.320
You want

11:08.520 --> 11:10.460
me to be by myself right now.

11:10.660 --> 11:12.100
Trust me.

11:17.450 --> 11:20.460
â™ª

11:24.110 --> 11:26.170
<i>DAN:</i>
<i>And how did she react?</i>

11:26.370 --> 11:28.910
MIKE:
She didn't. She wanted to know
if you knew that I was talking

11:29.110 --> 11:30.690
to her, and if Beth knew.

11:30.890 --> 11:33.260
- Like a threat?
- No, didn't seem like it.

11:33.460 --> 11:36.090
She said she felt like
Beth already did.

11:36.290 --> 11:38.010
Fuck.

11:38.210 --> 11:40.360
What the fuck
does that even mean?

11:40.560 --> 11:41.880
I...

11:42.080 --> 11:44.880
[sighs]

11:45.080 --> 11:47.100
She does know.

11:47.300 --> 11:48.450
Beth. I told her.

11:48.650 --> 11:51.540
- [sighs]
- Good for you, Danny. Yeah.

11:51.740 --> 11:54.020
Oh, Christ. Mikey,

11:54.220 --> 11:55.980
- was she in my goddamn house?
- I don't know.

11:56.180 --> 11:57.200
Which means yes.

11:57.400 --> 11:58.110
- Right?
- Yeah, probably yes.

11:58.310 --> 11:59.160
Probably yes.

11:59.360 --> 12:00.640
- Just...
- Fuck.

12:00.840 --> 12:02.460
But did you tell Beth
about any of this?

12:02.660 --> 12:04.860
Yes. I told her I was worried
it was a possibility.

12:05.060 --> 12:06.250
And?

12:06.450 --> 12:07.640
And she doesn't want
to hear it, Mike.

12:07.840 --> 12:08.990
She doesn't want me to say it.

12:09.190 --> 12:11.260
She doesn't want me
to repeat it.

12:11.460 --> 12:13.390
We got to do something now,
right? I mean, we have to.

12:13.590 --> 12:15.130
- We got to do something.
- Yeah, but first

12:15.330 --> 12:16.870
we got to think about what
that something is going to be.

12:17.070 --> 12:19.000
Even if all this with Sophie
is unrelated,

12:19.200 --> 12:20.610
we still got to think about it.

12:20.810 --> 12:22.880
I mean, she's definitely
thinking about it.

12:23.080 --> 12:25.400
Fuck. I got to get
a handle on her.

12:25.600 --> 12:27.190
I have not figured her out yet.

12:27.380 --> 12:29.930
Well, what if you don't?

12:30.130 --> 12:33.010
[sighs]
We could always kill her.

12:34.180 --> 12:36.460
Come on. Just, look,
we'll come up with something.

12:36.650 --> 12:38.070
Just for right now,
stay out of her way.

12:38.270 --> 12:39.880
Christ.

12:41.970 --> 12:43.160
<i>JULIA:</i>
<i>Where's Ellen?</i>

12:43.360 --> 12:45.940
- Should she be here?
- She should.

12:46.140 --> 12:47.470
You act like she listens to me.

12:47.670 --> 12:50.030
Ellen is, uh, watching <i>Stardust.</i>

12:50.230 --> 12:52.650
Okay. I brought beads.

12:52.840 --> 12:54.170
What do we think?

12:54.370 --> 12:57.000
I think she would be
totally into beads.

12:57.200 --> 12:58.700
Is Warren asleep?

12:58.890 --> 13:01.000
In the unconscious sense, yes.

13:01.200 --> 13:03.610
I also brought
a <i>Narnia</i>coloring book

13:03.810 --> 13:07.490
and a bath bomb
that has a necklace in it.

13:07.690 --> 13:10.490
- See you chumps in a few hours.
- Okay.

13:10.690 --> 13:13.570
I'll be right here. Okay.

13:16.750 --> 13:20.020
An actual fairy godmother.

13:20.220 --> 13:22.680
- Oh, God, I'm so sorry.
- [crying]

13:22.870 --> 13:25.110
I know, hon.

13:25.310 --> 13:28.770
Your mom, she was
a complicated woman,

13:28.970 --> 13:31.410
but I know she really
loved you a lot.

13:34.940 --> 13:36.250
It's Dan.

13:36.450 --> 13:37.650
What about him?

13:37.850 --> 13:39.210
He told me he was with
someone else.

13:39.410 --> 13:41.040
- What?
- A woman

13:41.240 --> 13:43.820
who works in his building.

13:46.300 --> 13:48.220
He said it was just a few times,

13:48.420 --> 13:50.400
it's over, it ended badly.

13:50.600 --> 13:51.970
Do you believe him?

13:52.170 --> 13:54.660
But he thinks that

13:54.860 --> 13:56.840
she came...

13:57.040 --> 13:58.840
to break in,

13:59.040 --> 14:00.410
steal things.

14:00.610 --> 14:01.930
That she didn't think
anyone was home,

14:02.130 --> 14:04.720
and that my mom...

14:04.920 --> 14:07.290
- surprised her or caught her
and surprised her.
- Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.

14:07.480 --> 14:09.550
What are you,
what are you saying?

14:09.750 --> 14:11.770
Is there any evidence? Is she...

14:11.970 --> 14:13.380
Is he having her arrested?

14:13.580 --> 14:15.080
I mean... [stammers]
he's a fucking prosecutor.

14:15.280 --> 14:17.600
Would he believe him?

14:17.800 --> 14:20.910
Look, I-I'm sorry.
Sorry, this isn't helping.

14:21.110 --> 14:23.520
So, what-what can I do?

14:23.720 --> 14:25.350
Don't tell anyone.

14:25.550 --> 14:26.650
- Especially...
- Oh...

14:26.850 --> 14:28.130
- Look, I'm...
- I don't want her

14:28.330 --> 14:30.260
to have anything else
in her head.

14:30.460 --> 14:32.880
I know, but Julia wouldn't
want you to, you know, decide

14:33.080 --> 14:34.270
she's not strong enough
to be your friend

14:34.470 --> 14:36.100
- when you need her most.
- I can't be strong

14:36.300 --> 14:38.010
if I think that
she's dealing with this

14:38.210 --> 14:41.890
on top of everything else.

14:42.080 --> 14:44.800
Just you.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.110
'Cause you're the dummy who said
to say the terrible things

14:47.310 --> 14:48.760
- out loud.
- [groans]

14:48.960 --> 14:51.760
Okay, so-so-so that's what
you don't want me to do.

14:51.960 --> 14:54.810
What can I do, though?

14:55.010 --> 14:57.340
- [sighs]
- Hmm?

14:57.530 --> 14:59.550
Nothing.

15:01.720 --> 15:03.780
What could you do?

15:03.980 --> 15:06.250
Make it so it didn't happen?

15:09.860 --> 15:11.730
You can't do anything.

15:24.220 --> 15:26.670
- Hey, skater buddy Ellen.
- Hey.

15:26.870 --> 15:28.630
Stella. I would've reached out
to you before,

15:28.830 --> 15:30.060
- but I didn't get your number.
- Oh, yeah.

15:30.260 --> 15:31.630
Thought I would
run into you before now.

15:31.830 --> 15:33.500
[chuckles] Did you see
the sign-up for Sky Zone?

15:33.700 --> 15:36.070
Um, yeah. You know, I did,
but I just... trampolines are

15:36.270 --> 15:37.800
- not my...
- Fucking amazing,
I know. [laughs]

15:39.150 --> 15:40.810
Oh, that's not what
you were gonna say.

15:41.010 --> 15:42.820
[both laugh]

15:43.010 --> 15:44.470
What, you don't
like trampolines?

15:44.670 --> 15:46.730
Why? Fear of what? Freedom?

15:46.930 --> 15:49.950
- Flying? Awesomeness?
- Uh, wetting my pants in public.

15:50.150 --> 15:52.690
Oh, so wear
an Always Ultra Thin.

15:52.890 --> 15:55.830
Okay. [laughs] Um...

15:56.030 --> 15:57.480
- I can take a hint.
- [chuckles]

15:57.680 --> 15:59.220
Even if I like to make it
seem like I can't.

15:59.420 --> 16:01.010
Give me your number, though,

16:01.210 --> 16:03.400
for stuff besides
tramping. Cool?

16:03.600 --> 16:05.190
- Yeah.
- Here.

16:05.390 --> 16:07.710
Uh... [clears throat]

16:07.910 --> 16:09.060
Thank you. Okay.

16:09.260 --> 16:11.320
- Ellen what again?
- Uh, T-O-M-

16:11.520 --> 16:12.930
L-I-N-S-O-N.

16:13.130 --> 16:14.670
Oh, right, Ellen Tomlinson.

16:14.870 --> 16:16.800
Got you now.

16:29.800 --> 16:31.510
Dumbass.

16:34.640 --> 16:35.610
[elevator bell dings]

16:35.810 --> 16:37.170
Jesus

16:37.370 --> 16:39.520
- fucking Christ.
- Sorry. [chuckles]

16:41.000 --> 16:42.140
Hi.

16:42.340 --> 16:43.650
You took my keys.

16:48.350 --> 16:50.530
I just wanted to tell you
that I spoke to Mike.

16:54.270 --> 16:57.060
- Give me the keys, Alex.
- [chuckles]

16:57.260 --> 16:58.530
Of course.

17:00.140 --> 17:03.330
At first, I was,
I was a bit upset.

17:03.530 --> 17:04.770
I just, I didn't get why

17:04.970 --> 17:07.030
you couldn't come
speak to me yourself.

17:07.230 --> 17:09.900
But I get it now.

17:10.100 --> 17:11.370
[elevator buzzes]

17:13.110 --> 17:14.520
So, don't worry.

17:14.720 --> 17:16.810
I understand.

I want to figure it out

18:13.560 --> 18:15.050
you go home.

18:15.250 --> 18:16.970
What?

18:17.170 --> 18:18.670
I just told Ellen
to take a bath.

18:18.870 --> 18:19.890
I'll put it off forever.

18:20.080 --> 18:22.970
I need you to not let me.

18:24.320 --> 18:26.020
Dad, we've barely...

18:26.220 --> 18:29.420
It's all right for you
to not be okay yet. It is.

18:29.620 --> 18:31.240
I'm never going to be okay.

18:32.410 --> 18:34.030
It's the longer I put off

18:34.230 --> 18:36.810
being here by myself, I j...

18:39.680 --> 18:41.330
Help me, Danny.

18:47.160 --> 18:49.260
Try it out for one night.

18:49.460 --> 18:51.310
If you want them
to come back tomorrow,

18:51.510 --> 18:53.140
they will.

18:53.340 --> 18:54.570
Right?

18:54.770 --> 18:55.790

Yeah, that's it.

18:55.990 --> 18:58.180

18:59.570 --> 19:00.970
Okay.

19:01.170 --> 19:02.750
You got it.

19:02.950 --> 19:04.540
But we're leaving
our stuff here.

19:04.740 --> 19:06.750
[weak chuckle]

19:20.020 --> 19:21.470
I couldn't let them leave me

19:21.670 --> 19:23.680
if I didn't know they had you.

19:26.250 --> 19:28.070
[sighs]

19:39.220 --> 19:42.270
I need you to take Ellen.
Take her with you in the car.

19:42.470 --> 19:44.320
Okay. Where are you going?

19:44.520 --> 19:46.620
The house on Satsuma
is a shit show.

19:46.820 --> 19:48.320
I've been leaving Arthur
to deal with all of it.

19:48.520 --> 19:51.060
Just distract her. I'll be back.

19:51.260 --> 19:53.200
Don't say anything about us.

19:53.400 --> 19:54.810
Of course.

19:55.010 --> 19:56.760
- I wouldn't.

<i>sorry to bother you today.</i>

<i>The boss wants to see you</i>

Okay. Thanks for the heads-up.

20:27.300 --> 20:29.270
<i>Of course. Take care.</i>

20:30.490 --> 20:32.490
Hey, boss. What's up?

20:34.450 --> 20:36.750
I need to talk to you
about a letter I received.

20:46.500 --> 20:48.600
Okay. What letter, from whom?

20:48.800 --> 20:49.640
Didn't say.

20:49.840 --> 20:52.910
But whoever it is, oh,

20:53.110 --> 20:55.130
- they're accusing you.
- What?

20:55.330 --> 20:56.780
It came directly to me,
and as far as I know,

20:56.980 --> 20:58.040
only to me.

20:58.240 --> 20:59.610
An actual letter, not an email?

20:59.810 --> 21:02.130
Yes. On paper.
It's not vague.

21:02.330 --> 21:04.270
- It's very specific.
- Well, what does--

21:04.470 --> 21:07.780
Actually, forget I asked that.
I know you can't tell me.

21:11.530 --> 21:14.320
- It's with HR now?
- I haven't involved them yet.

21:14.520 --> 21:17.190
You know, you're pretty
important to this office.

21:17.390 --> 21:18.760
Too important, probably.

21:18.960 --> 21:20.280
And when I think about
the kind of shit show

21:20.480 --> 21:21.810
we would immediately be
involved in if...

21:22.010 --> 21:23.550
- Jesus, Marcella...
- Not even to mention

21:23.750 --> 21:26.250
how hard it would be for me
to believe that you would

21:26.450 --> 21:28.510
behave the way that letter is
saying that you did.

21:28.710 --> 21:30.680
Whatever the letter is saying,
I didn't do it.

21:30.880 --> 21:32.300
I'm still looking into it.

21:32.490 --> 21:35.080
I'm keeping the circle
as small as possible.

21:35.280 --> 21:36.690
- Which means what?
- I'm giving it

21:36.890 --> 21:38.740
to Jeannette Ruiz.

21:38.940 --> 21:41.160
[scoffs]

21:43.250 --> 21:45.350
- What would you
like me to say to that?
- She's fair, Dan.

21:45.550 --> 21:47.750
She's fucking scrupulous,
in fact. You disagree?

21:47.940 --> 21:50.700
Good, because you can't.

21:50.900 --> 21:53.620
She's also discreet.
And you're not friends.

21:53.820 --> 21:55.800
- No, we are not friends.
- Which is good.

21:56.000 --> 21:59.190
I'm not friends with her either,
I mean, I need my friends

21:59.390 --> 22:00.190
to have a sense of humor.

22:00.390 --> 22:01.540
But I need my people to

22:01.740 --> 22:03.010
do the right thing,
and she will.

22:04.880 --> 22:06.940
You know, I need for you to
take some time off.

22:07.140 --> 22:09.290
Aw, come on, Marc--
How is that gonna look?

22:09.490 --> 22:10.900
I have a ton of shit
in process right now.

22:11.100 --> 22:12.680
What am I gonna say
is the reason?

22:12.880 --> 22:15.770
Well, in light of recent
tragic family events...

22:15.970 --> 22:18.330
No one's going to ask.

22:24.950 --> 22:27.520
You gonna make Frank
charge my robbery or what?

22:27.720 --> 22:29.180
I haven't read
the transcript yet.

22:29.380 --> 22:30.870
Which means no.

22:32.960 --> 22:34.360
You leaving for the day?

22:34.560 --> 22:36.230
Shit, it's kind of early
to be done, huh?

22:36.430 --> 22:38.400
- None of your business, Earl.
- Right.

22:38.600 --> 22:41.020
Because I never ask questions
that aren't my business.

22:41.220 --> 22:42.890
Basically, it's my whole job,
if you think about it.

22:43.090 --> 22:44.760
My wife's mother died
a few days ago,

22:44.960 --> 22:46.890
so there's a lot going on
at home, a lot to take care of.

22:47.090 --> 22:48.240
- Is that all right?
- Yeah. Listen,

22:48.440 --> 22:49.680
I'm very sorry to hear that.

22:49.880 --> 22:51.420
Thank you.

22:51.620 --> 22:52.770
Still though, you're head
of Major Crimes Bureau.

22:52.970 --> 22:54.200
It's not even 10:00
in the morning.

22:54.400 --> 22:55.940
- Where the hell are you going?
- [sighs]

22:56.140 --> 22:58.250
You know what?
Fuck you for ambushing me.

22:58.450 --> 23:00.210
And fuck you for thinking
you know what my job is.

23:00.410 --> 23:01.990
You think it's a bunch of
ass kissing

23:02.190 --> 23:04.170
and handing out favors when
what it really is

23:04.370 --> 23:06.430
is catching bullshit cases
from bullshit detectives

23:06.630 --> 23:07.910
and trying to make something
out of them,

23:08.110 --> 23:09.820
which I can do
from fucking home.

23:11.780 --> 23:15.610
Hey. My deepest condolences.

23:22.530 --> 23:24.320
<i>DAN:</i>
<i>It's not a bad idea.</i>

23:24.520 --> 23:25.970
<i>MIKE [over phone]: Yeah, well,</i>
<i>it's not a good idea.</i>

23:26.170 --> 23:27.280
<i>Guy's at work</i>
<i>in the middle of the day,</i>

23:27.480 --> 23:28.630
<i>public-facing job.</i>

23:28.830 --> 23:29.720
<i>And suddenly here's you,</i>

23:29.920 --> 23:30.850
<i>even if he knows you got parole.</i>

23:31.050 --> 23:32.460
Well, yeah, that's the point.

23:32.660 --> 23:34.290
Surprise him so we get
an uncalibrated reaction.

23:34.490 --> 23:36.460
<i>Oh, you're gonna surprise him,</i>
<i>showing up saying</i>

23:36.660 --> 23:38.120
<i>he should be a suspect</i>
<i>in the murder</i>

23:38.320 --> 23:39.940
<i>you went to prison for.</i>

23:40.140 --> 23:41.900
<i>You might get an uncalibrated</i>
<i>punch in the mouth.</i>

23:42.100 --> 23:43.900
[chuckles]

23:44.100 --> 23:45.910
I'm not gonna accuse
the man of anything.

23:46.110 --> 23:47.870
I just want him to confirm
that he's the one

23:48.060 --> 23:50.170
that made the unofficial
complaint to Conchita

23:50.370 --> 23:51.520
so I can put it
in the application.

23:51.720 --> 23:53.220
<i>Tomato-tomato, Danny.</i>

23:53.420 --> 23:55.480
<i>But it can't be today,</i>
<i>or tomorrow, anyway.</i>

23:55.680 --> 23:58.180
<i>No, I'm in Pomona on a case.</i>
<i>I need to pay my bills.</i>

23:58.380 --> 24:00.090
<i>So you're gonna have to wait</i>
<i>to get punched</i>

24:00.290 --> 24:01.970
<i>- until I'm done.</i>
- Hold on one second.

24:02.170 --> 24:04.010
- Hey there, how's it going?
- Good, thank you.

24:04.210 --> 24:06.800
Good. Uh, this is awkward,

24:07.000 --> 24:09.670
but I need you to
go down to Central Court today

24:09.870 --> 24:11.110
to file some papers.

24:11.310 --> 24:12.890
Not awkward at all.
Happy to do it.

24:13.090 --> 24:15.940
Okay. Just the idea

24:16.140 --> 24:17.550
that I would ever be asking you

24:17.750 --> 24:19.200
- to go and...
- Jorge.

24:19.400 --> 24:22.240
I appreciate that,
but it's fine.

24:23.890 --> 24:25.600
Great.

24:25.800 --> 24:28.820
- So, could you do it soon?
- Absolutely.

24:29.020 --> 24:30.300
Stop by Suzanne, she's got
everything you need.

24:30.500 --> 24:31.770
Will do.

24:33.250 --> 24:34.220
- Still there?
<i>- MIKE: Yeah.</i>

24:34.420 --> 24:35.520
Looks like I'm gonna go see

24:35.720 --> 24:37.130
Gabriel without you today.

24:37.330 --> 24:39.210
<i>Like you weren't</i>
<i>going to anyway.</i>

24:47.610 --> 24:49.880
[muffled, distorted chatter]

24:50.080 --> 24:52.700
[sighs]

24:57.010 --> 24:59.190
Holy shit.

25:00.320 --> 25:03.720
Benny. Gabriel.

25:03.920 --> 25:06.340
How you guys doing?

25:06.530 --> 25:08.730
Dan Gallagher.

25:08.930 --> 25:12.300
Goddamn, this is crazy.

25:12.500 --> 25:13.950
How long you been out?

25:14.150 --> 25:15.730
Not long.

25:19.380 --> 25:20.830
Can I buy you a cup of coffee?

25:21.030 --> 25:22.790
Judge Curtis in conference now,

25:22.990 --> 25:25.830
so sorry, no time for a break.

25:26.030 --> 25:28.170
All right.
Can we talk, though?

25:37.750 --> 25:39.890
Look, I'm-I'm writing up

25:40.090 --> 25:41.720
- a new trial application.
- Okay.

25:41.920 --> 25:43.020
For who? For you?

25:43.220 --> 25:44.590
Yeah, yeah.

25:44.790 --> 25:46.770
And I found out that you filed
a grievance

25:46.970 --> 25:48.330
against Alex Forrest
before she died,

25:48.530 --> 25:49.770
and obviously,
if I would have known that,

25:49.970 --> 25:51.510
I would have brought it up
at my trial.

25:51.710 --> 25:53.990
Well, if you know, you know
it was unofficial, right?

25:54.190 --> 25:55.820
It wasn't formal.

25:56.020 --> 25:57.560
But it was important enough
to involve your union rep.

25:57.760 --> 26:00.080
That's right, because
that's what they're there for.

26:00.280 --> 26:02.390
They said get it on record,
get insurance,

26:02.590 --> 26:04.610
don't get fired off this woman
who can't take a hint.

26:04.810 --> 26:06.130
And you did exactly
the right thing.

26:06.330 --> 26:08.480
And thank you for being
so forthcoming.

26:08.680 --> 26:11.790
Um, look, I'm sorry.

26:11.990 --> 26:13.750
I didn't have time to
write up an affidavit

26:13.950 --> 26:16.360
before I got here, but now that
we've had a chance to talk,

26:16.560 --> 26:18.060
- maybe I can go draft one
and bring it back.
- Whoa.

26:18.260 --> 26:21.050
Why? I'm not signing shit
for you, dude.

26:25.270 --> 26:27.850
I did 15 years for
a crime I didn't commit.

26:28.050 --> 26:29.720
I'm just asking for your help.

26:29.920 --> 26:32.030
You want to hand my ass over
to a judge to rule on?

26:32.230 --> 26:33.730
[laughs]

26:33.930 --> 26:36.330
Why would I let you do that?

26:42.030 --> 26:45.170
Hey, you don't matter
in this building anymore,

26:45.370 --> 26:46.960
you entitled motherfucker.

26:47.160 --> 26:48.440
You want my help?

26:48.640 --> 26:50.470
Subpoena it.

27:01.660 --> 27:03.570
And you thought
he used to be cranky.

27:04.710 --> 27:07.890
Anyway,
it's good to see you, man.

27:08.090 --> 27:09.070
Is it?

27:09.270 --> 27:11.500
Yeah.

27:11.700 --> 27:13.770
Why wouldn't it be?

27:13.970 --> 27:15.290
I never thought
you killed anybody,

27:15.490 --> 27:18.900
and even if you did,
you still wouldn't be

27:19.100 --> 27:21.160
the worst person I've ever met.

27:24.120 --> 27:26.740
- But you don't?
- No.

27:26.940 --> 27:29.600
Not even with all the rumors.

27:31.340 --> 27:32.700
Can I buy you lunch?

27:32.900 --> 27:34.950
I could eat.

27:36.690 --> 27:40.400
On Fairfax, the Irish bar,
live music type place.

27:40.600 --> 27:44.670
Uh, you and some brunette that
they thought was a witness

27:44.870 --> 27:46.060
in that death penalty case.

27:46.260 --> 27:47.190
You know, the one
with the ranch hands

27:47.390 --> 27:48.150
who killed the guy's ex-wife.

27:48.350 --> 27:49.590
I've never been to a live

27:49.780 --> 27:50.980
Irish music place in my life.

27:51.180 --> 27:52.500
Well, I'm just saying
what was said.

27:52.700 --> 27:54.020
[snorts]

27:54.220 --> 27:56.810
And that you got a fuck pad
in Burbank.

27:57.010 --> 27:58.680
- Wow.
- A condo, or something
like that.

27:58.880 --> 28:00.070
[chuckles]

28:00.270 --> 28:01.680
That you were always
asking people

28:01.880 --> 28:02.900
- to go with you there
after work.
- Really?

28:03.100 --> 28:04.470
- Mm-hmm.
- What people?

28:04.670 --> 28:05.780
I mean, never whoever
was saying anything

28:05.970 --> 28:08.210
would ever say, but...

28:08.410 --> 28:11.300
Holy shit. Well...

28:11.500 --> 28:14.170
- Is there anything else?
- No.

28:14.370 --> 28:16.480
Well, yes.

28:16.680 --> 28:18.660
It's that hot chick in Records.

28:18.860 --> 28:20.790
She drove around in a Porsche,
and for some reason,

28:20.990 --> 28:23.440
people were saying that you
bought it for her,

28:23.640 --> 28:25.870
or leased it,
or whatever it was.

28:27.700 --> 28:29.410
Obviously, it was all bullshit.

28:29.610 --> 28:31.060
Yeah, Benny, I know.

28:31.260 --> 28:33.370
I'm aware I didn't have
a fuck pad in Burbank.

28:33.570 --> 28:35.590
[Benny laughs]

28:35.790 --> 28:37.550
She had a thing
for Gabe, though.

28:37.750 --> 28:40.280
Alex Forrest.

28:41.850 --> 28:44.290
He was always handing me off
all these awesome donuts

28:44.490 --> 28:46.560
that she'd bring for him.

28:46.750 --> 28:50.200
Never said anything, though.
Not till after.

28:53.160 --> 28:55.040
Hmm.

28:55.240 --> 28:56.480
And what about her?

28:56.680 --> 28:58.040
Can I get you another one? Good?

28:58.240 --> 28:59.440
- You ever hear any rumors
about her?
- No.

28:59.640 --> 29:01.180
But I did see her
on the fifth floor once.

29:01.380 --> 29:03.880
By the good vending machines.

29:04.080 --> 29:05.660
With the spicy trail mix.

29:05.860 --> 29:08.450
She was arguing with this guy.

29:08.650 --> 29:10.540
You know who it was?
Or you never knew?

29:10.730 --> 29:12.830
No, I've seen him around.

29:15.440 --> 29:17.240
I think he was in Legal Aid.

29:17.440 --> 29:18.760
Felt like I remember seeing him

29:18.960 --> 29:22.720
in the, uh, in the courtroom
with Ruth.

29:22.920 --> 29:26.510
Low-key guy. Blond hair.

29:26.710 --> 29:28.290
Griffin?

29:28.490 --> 29:31.340
Smith? Biff?

29:31.540 --> 29:33.560
I don't know, khakis.

29:33.760 --> 29:35.170
Man, this place still really
makes the shit

29:35.370 --> 29:36.990
out of some shrimp.

29:45.130 --> 29:46.820
[door closes]

29:53.050 --> 29:55.410
Why'd you come back?

29:55.610 --> 29:57.190
With everything that's going on,

29:57.390 --> 29:58.930
it's been a little hard
to focus at the office,

29:59.130 --> 30:01.370
so I'm gonna prep
from here this week.

30:01.570 --> 30:05.160
Marcella's okay with that?

30:05.350 --> 30:07.330
Yeah.

30:07.530 --> 30:10.380
So I can get Ellen from the bus.

30:10.580 --> 30:13.990
You can stay later at
the office, if that helps.

30:14.190 --> 30:15.720
Okay, thank you.

30:19.860 --> 30:22.780
It mostly helps because...

30:22.980 --> 30:25.600
I don't know how to be
in this house.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.570
[kids chattering]

30:40.620 --> 30:42.540
Hey, snicklefritz.

30:42.740 --> 30:43.980
Mom doesn't wait here.

30:44.180 --> 30:45.410
She waits at the driveway.

30:45.610 --> 30:46.980
I know that.

30:47.180 --> 30:48.810
- I cross by myself.
- Well, I know that,

30:49.010 --> 30:50.640
but I didn't come here because
I thought you needed me.

30:50.830 --> 30:52.420
I came here because
I needed you.

30:52.620 --> 30:54.550
I really wanted to
hold your hand today.

30:54.750 --> 30:56.210
And I might want to
hold your hand tomorrow.

30:56.410 --> 30:58.070
I'm not sure yet.

31:01.680 --> 31:03.030
Are you okay?

31:07.160 --> 31:10.130
Yeah, I'm doing all right now.
How about you?

31:10.330 --> 31:11.610
How you doing?

31:11.810 --> 31:13.520
I am if you are.

31:16.960 --> 31:18.790
<i>ADULT ELLEN:</i>
<i>Gin makes the blood vessels</i>
<i>in your face explode.</i>

31:18.990 --> 31:20.320
<i>DAN:</i>
<i>That's not true, actually.</i>

31:20.520 --> 31:22.010
You know, Grandpa Warren
would be very upset

31:22.210 --> 31:23.150
if he heard you say that.

31:23.350 --> 31:24.710
He always thought of himself as

31:24.910 --> 31:26.540
the global ambassador
for gin's good name.

31:26.740 --> 31:28.460
- What about bourbon?
- Bourbon is prunes.

31:28.660 --> 31:30.020
- What are you talking about?
- Southern Comfort, it's prunes.

31:30.220 --> 31:32.420
Southern Comfort is
hardly bourbon.

31:32.620 --> 31:34.720
And Southern Comfort is
not prunes. That's Dr. Pepper.

31:34.920 --> 31:36.810
And Dr. Pepper isn't prunes
either, so...

31:37.010 --> 31:38.990
So just beer and wine, then?

31:39.190 --> 31:41.380
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, me too, mostly.

31:41.580 --> 31:43.040
Though there was
a long time there

31:43.240 --> 31:45.600
where I was daydreaming
about Bloody Marys,

31:45.800 --> 31:47.170
which were never really
my thing.

31:47.370 --> 31:48.260
Yeah, it's Mike's thing.

31:48.460 --> 31:50.560
Yeah, that's why.

31:50.760 --> 31:52.610
All those years watching him
knock 'em back,

31:52.810 --> 31:55.530
it symbolized being
out in the world, I guess.

31:55.730 --> 31:57.570
Mm.

31:57.770 --> 32:00.620
But now I'm here,
and all I really want

32:00.820 --> 32:02.570
is a beer.

32:09.010 --> 32:10.760
Oh, man, that's good.

32:10.960 --> 32:12.360
[chuckles]

32:19.890 --> 32:21.160
This is really nice.

32:21.360 --> 32:23.160
And a real head trip.

32:23.360 --> 32:27.040
[exhales sharply]
After...

32:27.240 --> 32:28.990
missing all those years,

32:29.190 --> 32:31.520
to sit here and feel like
I know you,

32:31.720 --> 32:34.300
but to know less about you

32:34.500 --> 32:36.480
than somebody who
barely knows you.

32:36.680 --> 32:39.220
What other people think of
as other people

32:39.420 --> 32:43.090
is really just a projection
of themselves anyway.

32:45.610 --> 32:48.180
What do you want to know?

32:54.580 --> 32:56.810
If it's already built,

32:57.000 --> 32:58.670
why do they call it a building?

33:02.410 --> 33:03.900
Why are they called "apartments"

33:04.100 --> 33:06.070
if they're so close together?

33:12.860 --> 33:14.680
What was it about her?

33:22.690 --> 33:24.950
[Dan sighs]

33:26.220 --> 33:29.050
I don't think it was
actually about her.

33:32.830 --> 33:35.840
Which makes me feel sick
to my stomach to say.

33:36.040 --> 33:39.720
But when I try to remember
what I was feeling

33:39.920 --> 33:41.150
when all that was happening,

33:41.350 --> 33:43.850
mostly I just remember
being afraid.

33:44.050 --> 33:46.460
Of what?

33:46.660 --> 33:49.470
That life had passed me by,
and I didn't even notice.

33:49.670 --> 33:51.730
Hmm.

33:51.930 --> 33:54.990
You're the psychology major...
[clears throat]

33:55.190 --> 33:58.210
and the Jung scholar.

33:58.410 --> 33:59.650
Pretty sure you'd have
a lot more insight

33:59.850 --> 34:00.780
into that than I do.

34:00.980 --> 34:02.650
Well, Mom always said that

34:02.850 --> 34:04.350
your father never
believed in you.

34:04.550 --> 34:06.440
And if that was true,
then you're never gonna think

34:06.640 --> 34:07.880
that you're good enough.

34:08.080 --> 34:10.310
Even if consciously,
on the outside,

34:10.510 --> 34:12.490
you're pushing back, you're
fighting against that idea,

34:12.690 --> 34:15.880
on the inside you're always
just gonna be waiting to fail

34:16.080 --> 34:17.150
because deep down
you really think that

34:17.350 --> 34:18.760
failure is your destiny.

34:18.960 --> 34:22.280
So maybe when you did fail,

34:22.480 --> 34:24.020
when you didn't get to
become a judge,

34:24.220 --> 34:26.070
you just decided to stop
fighting the part of yourself

34:26.270 --> 34:27.770
that secretly thought
that you were worthless,

34:27.960 --> 34:32.240
and instead, just do
something to prove it.

34:38.460 --> 34:40.070
Sorry.

34:42.030 --> 34:43.640
Don't be sorry.

34:45.860 --> 34:47.650
I asked.

34:47.850 --> 34:49.700
<i>RUIZ:</i>
<i>I'm doing an internal</i>
<i>investigation,</i>

34:49.900 --> 34:52.050
<i>and I'm hoping you can help me.</i>

34:52.250 --> 34:55.880
<i>Can you tell me how</i>
<i>you know Danny Gallagher?</i>

34:56.080 --> 35:00.410
Uh, I was assigned
to a case of his

35:00.610 --> 35:03.240
in sentencing phase
is how I met him.

35:03.440 --> 35:06.670
And then I got assigned to
another pending case of his

35:06.870 --> 35:08.110
that didn't go.

35:08.310 --> 35:10.590
I have a witness
who places you with him

35:10.790 --> 35:13.680
at Andolini's Restaurant
on the ninth last month,

35:13.880 --> 35:15.120
which was a Friday.

35:15.320 --> 35:18.420
- You remember that night?
- Yeah, actually.

35:18.620 --> 35:20.640
- Can you tell me
what it was like?
- What it was like?

35:20.840 --> 35:23.430
Um, that sounds kind of loaded.

35:23.630 --> 35:26.260
It isn't meant to,
it's just meant to be

35:26.460 --> 35:30.480
open enough to include whatever
you might want to tell me.

35:30.680 --> 35:34.040
I want to tell you everything.

35:37.000 --> 35:38.710
<i>I haven't lived here very long,</i>

35:38.910 --> 35:42.230
so I don't really know
that many people.

35:42.430 --> 35:45.500
I work most of the time, so...

35:45.690 --> 35:47.760
so I was having dinner
at the bar,

35:47.960 --> 35:51.720
and he was there
meeting somebody.

35:51.920 --> 35:54.500
A colleague, I think.

35:54.700 --> 35:58.730
And we just struck up
a conversation.

35:58.930 --> 36:01.900
About work, but more...

36:02.100 --> 36:04.300
more our philosophy of work.

36:04.500 --> 36:07.160
You know, conceptualizing
what we do.

36:08.990 --> 36:10.520
Also, our parents.

36:10.720 --> 36:13.090
Um, our fathers.

36:13.290 --> 36:16.210
His father was a judge.

36:18.300 --> 36:22.960
I don't know, just
good conversation.

36:25.050 --> 36:28.050
I don't really have
many of those.

36:29.180 --> 36:31.930
He made me...

36:32.130 --> 36:35.490
He made me wish that
I had more friends.

36:38.370 --> 36:40.330
Conchita's al--
Sorry, my boss is...

36:40.530 --> 36:43.550
- That's okay. I love Conchita.
- She's always saying

36:43.750 --> 36:46.210
that Dan Gallagher,
he's one of the good guys.

36:46.410 --> 36:51.250
And... I felt like
that night I saw why.

36:56.950 --> 36:59.050
You're cleared, it's done.

36:59.250 --> 37:00.830
I still need to
fill Marcella in,

37:01.030 --> 37:03.830
but as far as I'm concerned,
the letter, the allegation

37:04.030 --> 37:05.750
in the letter is unfounded.

37:05.950 --> 37:09.140
Okay, so that's it?

37:09.340 --> 37:10.580
Yep. Back to work.

37:10.780 --> 37:11.710
Although maybe let Marcella
be the one

37:11.910 --> 37:12.580
to officially tell you that.

37:12.780 --> 37:15.020
Uh, thank you.

37:15.220 --> 37:17.850
You should thank
your friend Alex.

37:18.050 --> 37:20.490
She's the one who
saved your ass.

37:25.370 --> 37:28.420
<i>RUIZ:</i>
<i>I think that's all I need.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

37:40.640 --> 37:42.390
- Whew.
- You okay?

37:42.590 --> 37:43.870
Headrush.

37:44.070 --> 37:45.090
- Get you some water?
- No, I'm fine.

37:45.290 --> 37:46.920
I'm just...

37:47.120 --> 37:48.790
[exhales sharply]

37:48.990 --> 37:51.140
I'm good. Just a little, um...

37:51.340 --> 37:52.740
A little pregnant.

37:54.220 --> 37:56.310
But shh.

38:05.800 --> 38:07.160
You better gird your loins,

38:07.360 --> 38:09.330
because we have to
go over your schedule.

38:09.530 --> 38:13.080
Okay. That's fine.

38:13.280 --> 38:14.690
Just glad to be back.

38:14.890 --> 38:16.640
Never a doubt in my mind.

38:25.340 --> 38:27.610
<i>DAN:</i>
<i>She wants me to owe her</i>
<i>something, right?</i>

38:27.810 --> 38:29.570
She wants to be the one
who rescues me.

38:29.770 --> 38:31.650
Arsonist, fireman.

38:32.650 --> 38:34.870
Oh, fuck.

38:36.130 --> 38:37.880
You don't look all that
surprised, Mike.

38:38.080 --> 38:40.190
I don't think I am anymore.

38:40.390 --> 38:42.150
- Okay, so what are you?
- I'm your friend,

38:42.350 --> 38:44.460
who's trying to
look at this objectively.

38:44.660 --> 38:46.370
And I think this woman is--

38:46.570 --> 38:50.550
she is telling herself
a story about you.

38:50.750 --> 38:53.540
- Clearly.
- One that you helped her write.

38:55.070 --> 38:56.690
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean?

38:56.890 --> 38:58.170
Look, obviously

38:58.370 --> 38:59.860
if you just bent this
Alex woman over

39:00.060 --> 39:01.600
a bathroom sink one night,
never spoke to her again,

39:01.800 --> 39:02.950
this could all still
be happening.

39:03.150 --> 39:04.650
Right, 'cause she's
out of her mind.

39:04.850 --> 39:06.000
Well, maybe so,
but that's not what you did

39:06.200 --> 39:07.830
because that's not
what you do, Dan.

39:08.030 --> 39:09.790
Mike...

39:09.990 --> 39:11.880
I've never cheated
on Beth before.

39:12.070 --> 39:13.310
I know you need people
to like you.

39:13.510 --> 39:16.580
Not just juries,
but fucking everybody.

39:16.780 --> 39:19.270
You laugh with them,
you listen to them,

39:19.470 --> 39:20.800
you confide in them.

39:21.000 --> 39:22.280
You put on "The Dan Show,"
it's what you do.

39:22.480 --> 39:23.630
But this woman is the one
who's supposed to

39:23.830 --> 39:24.890
somehow know you didn't mean it?

39:25.090 --> 39:26.890
What is this?

39:27.090 --> 39:30.020
I didn't-- Hey,
I didn't say anything,

39:30.220 --> 39:33.110
I didn't do anything
that would justify...

39:33.310 --> 39:35.420
No, it's how she heard
what you said that matters.

39:35.620 --> 39:37.510
She's building a world
in her fucking head

39:37.710 --> 39:39.380
about something you did
because you were mad

39:39.580 --> 39:41.560
you were gonna have to wait
to be a fucking judge, man.

39:41.760 --> 39:44.080
You know, the next time
you're disappointed,

39:44.280 --> 39:45.820
why don't you just try
to sit with that feeling,

39:46.020 --> 39:48.560
the way the rest of us
have to fuckin' do?!

39:55.820 --> 39:59.400
- [pop music playing]
- [indistinct chatter, laughter]

39:59.600 --> 40:01.230
STELLA:
Is that unusual to get out

40:01.430 --> 40:02.930
the first time that
you're up for parole?

40:03.130 --> 40:05.840
It depends, I think,
on the crime and the criminal,

40:06.040 --> 40:08.060
but yeah.

40:08.260 --> 40:09.410
What's it like
when you're with him?

40:09.610 --> 40:13.110
Is it just like,
"Yeah, that's my father"?

40:13.310 --> 40:18.250
It's like he's this person
that I know is my father,

40:18.450 --> 40:20.800
- but I don't feel it.
- Mm.

40:23.240 --> 40:25.430
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

40:25.630 --> 40:27.900
Little bit.

40:29.250 --> 40:31.430
[chuckles]

40:31.630 --> 40:35.050
At the risk of sounding
like an asshole,

40:35.240 --> 40:38.660
uh, it might not be irrelevant

40:38.860 --> 40:40.790
for you to do your thesis
about Jungian shit.

40:40.990 --> 40:44.840
I mean, your life is
pretty archetypal right now.

40:45.040 --> 40:47.140
- Yeah.
- Also, hey,

40:47.340 --> 40:49.230
I feel honored that you
trusted me with this.

40:49.430 --> 40:51.930
I, of course, have no drama
or secrets of my own,

40:52.130 --> 40:53.190
so I have no
frame of reference, but...

40:53.390 --> 40:54.930
Yeah, you do seem very boring.

40:55.130 --> 40:57.070
- Very.
- Yeah.

40:57.270 --> 41:00.900
You know that part
of the college application

41:01.100 --> 41:04.940
where they ask you if you've
ever been on probation?

41:05.140 --> 41:08.170
I mean, not specifically,
but yeah.

41:08.360 --> 41:11.390
Well, I have been on probation.

41:11.590 --> 41:13.390
For five years I was on it.

41:13.590 --> 41:15.520
From 17 until last year.

41:15.720 --> 41:18.350
It was a DWI with injuries.
Nobody died.

41:18.550 --> 41:21.740
But... I'm a felon.

41:21.940 --> 41:25.100
Juvenile felon.

41:25.290 --> 41:27.180
And nobody here knows but you.

41:27.380 --> 41:28.750
Now I feel honored.

41:28.950 --> 41:30.840
- [laughs]
- Thank you.

41:31.040 --> 41:32.530
Mm. Yeah.

41:34.140 --> 41:37.060
How did you know that I was
writing about Jungian shit?

41:37.260 --> 41:40.190
- You told me.
- No.

41:43.150 --> 41:45.630
Okay, um...

41:48.890 --> 41:51.250
I have a thing with Macksey.

41:51.450 --> 41:53.600
We're like a-a thing.

41:53.800 --> 41:56.210
Okay? So just-- shh.

41:56.410 --> 41:58.780
Well, what kind of...

41:58.980 --> 42:01.870
- Ooh. Mmm.
- Mm.

42:02.070 --> 42:04.180
[both moan]

42:04.380 --> 42:06.830
Great. Is...
is there anything else?

42:07.030 --> 42:08.790
Is that not enough?
Am I still boring?

42:08.990 --> 42:10.840
- No, no, I mean,
now you're a clichÃ©.
- Oh.

42:11.040 --> 42:12.270
Oh, okay.

42:12.470 --> 42:14.830
[both laugh]

42:15.880 --> 42:17.760
Everything is going
to be all right.

42:17.960 --> 42:20.190
How should I not be glad
to contemplate the clouds

42:20.390 --> 42:22.240
parting
beyond the dormer window,

42:22.440 --> 42:24.680

<i>You got the surgery bill now,</i>

43:17.670 --> 43:19.820

the anesthesia bill first.

43:20.020 --> 43:22.080
And when you got
the anesthesia bill first,

43:22.280 --> 43:23.820
you didn't think
to reach out to see

43:24.020 --> 43:25.910
if the hospital did any surgery
on my wife

43:26.110 --> 43:29.260
to go with the anesthesia,
you just denied the claim.

43:29.460 --> 43:31.260
Makes total sense.

43:31.460 --> 43:34.010
No, I asked Dr. Geller
to rebill you.

43:34.210 --> 43:35.970
So when he does,
you can take the two bills,

43:36.160 --> 43:38.320
put 'em together and see that
you do cover anesthesia

43:38.510 --> 43:42.670
for fucking
ovarian cancer surgery, okay?

43:42.870 --> 43:44.710
Thank you.

43:49.130 --> 43:50.810
- Hmm?
- Of the elephant.

43:51.010 --> 43:52.980
Eat the elephant
one bite at a time?

43:53.180 --> 43:55.160
[chuckles]

43:55.360 --> 43:59.120
Right, because God never
gives you more elephant

43:59.320 --> 44:00.600
than you can eat?

44:00.800 --> 44:02.810
Courage is elephant
under pressure?

44:03.940 --> 44:06.260
You never know
how elephant you are

44:06.460 --> 44:08.520
until elephant's
your only choice?

44:08.720 --> 44:11.220

Gideon's here...

44:11.420 --> 44:13.260
with his new truck.

44:13.460 --> 44:15.700
I wonder if he bought that
with our money.

44:15.900 --> 44:17.270
Tough times don't last.

45:21.230 --> 45:22.810
This isn't steel.
