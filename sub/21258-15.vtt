00:09.729 --> 00:11.295
I'm actually
loaning you this money,

00:19.645 --> 00:21.312

I accept it?

00:21.347 --> 00:22.791

to figure out.

00:22.815 --> 00:24.682
How much are you gonna spend
to buy me out,

00:24.717 --> 00:26.261

00:26.262 --> 00:27.428

we cut her a check,

00:27.463 --> 00:28.954
we don't have a leg
to stand on in court.

that son of a bitch

00:31.858 --> 00:33.736

00:33.737 --> 00:35.854
Wait a second.
Stanley Gordon doesn't need money.

00:35.855 --> 00:38.033
He just wants the world to know
that Jessica's name's dog shit.

a public statement

00:39.425 --> 00:40.736

00:46.689 --> 00:47.833

01:25.479 --> 01:28.013

how to say this,

01:28.048 --> 01:29.948
so I'm just going to say it.

01:29.984 --> 01:32.985
I got into a case.
It started getting to me,

01:33.020 --> 01:37.255
and the next thing I knew,
it turned into a class action.

01:37.733 --> 01:38.810
Nathan, you don't
have the resources

01:38.834 --> 01:40.382
to take on a class action.

01:40.383 --> 01:42.316
That didn't stop you
from taking on

01:42.352 --> 01:43.629
those miners last year.
- No, it didn't.

01:43.653 --> 01:47.121
But I ended up needing to go
to Pearson Specter for help.

01:47.157 --> 01:49.257
Why do you think
I'm here now?

01:49.292 --> 01:51.626
You want me to ask my firm
to help you?

01:51.661 --> 01:54.595
I want your firm to make an
investment in the clinic.

01:54.631 --> 01:56.230
Nathan, that's never
going to happen.

01:56.266 --> 01:57.732
Well, I need
some kind of help.

01:57.767 --> 01:59.233
Because there are
a bunch of children

01:59.269 --> 02:00.713
who are never going
to live normal lives,

02:00.737 --> 02:02.170
and if I don't
think of something,

02:02.205 --> 02:03.482
I'm going to have to choose
between them,

02:03.506 --> 02:04.872
and keeping the clinic
in business.

02:04.908 --> 02:05.951
Wait, wait, wait,
what do you mean

02:05.975 --> 02:07.575
they're never going
to have normal lives?

02:07.610 --> 02:09.176
There's a school
in upstate New York.

02:09.620 --> 02:11.531
About ten years ago,
Discharge Power started making

02:11.555 --> 02:13.440
batteries
a thousand yards away.

02:13.482 --> 02:16.749
Those kids started getting
lead poisoning.

02:16.785 --> 02:21.120
And they say it's not
from the plant, but it is.

02:21.156 --> 02:23.623
All right, I have an idea.

02:23.658 --> 02:25.024
But it's not giving you money,

02:25.060 --> 02:27.427

the law is clear on this.

They missed the deadline,
and you are obligated

08:45.445 --> 08:46.918
to dismiss this case.
- He's right, Your Honor.

08:46.919 --> 08:49.776
I missed the deadline,
but there are 150 children

08:49.777 --> 08:51.302
with elevated levels
of lead in their blood

08:51.303 --> 08:53.381

because I made a mistake.

08:53.405 --> 08:54.771
Well, that is a
wonderful story,

08:54.806 --> 08:56.406
but the truth is,
he doesn't care

08:56.441 --> 08:57.952
about these children
because this is a cash grab,

08:57.976 --> 09:00.043
plain and simple.
- Cash grab?

09:00.590 --> 09:02.390
Our fees are capped at $50,000.

09:02.425 --> 09:04.125
$50,000
keeps your clinic running

09:04.160 --> 09:06.294
for a hell of a long time,
and I still haven't heard

09:06.329 --> 09:08.062
one piece of evidence
that we even knew

09:08.098 --> 09:10.231
about these lead levels.
- Your Honor, if I may,

09:10.266 --> 09:12.378
I have some evidence I'd like
to share with the court.

09:12.402 --> 09:14.402
- And you are?
- Mike Ross, Specter Litt,

09:14.437 --> 09:16.248
Your Honor, and I think
it might interest the court

09:16.272 --> 09:18.005
to know a little
of Mr. Collins' history

09:18.041 --> 09:20.274
with cases like this.
- What are you talking about?

09:20.310 --> 09:22.343
Your last case
against a clinic.

09:22.794 --> 09:25.060
You created 16 situations
just like this,

09:25.096 --> 09:26.762
and then, on the 17th,
it got thrown out,

09:26.798 --> 09:28.838
because they finally
missed a deadline.

09:28.839 --> 09:30.883
That is a mischaracterization
of the facts, Your Honor.

09:30.907 --> 09:33.641
Whereas only 10%
of Nathan Krueger's cases

09:33.677 --> 09:36.344
even involve monetary damages,
because this man

09:36.380 --> 09:38.613
spends most of his time
trying to keep poor people

09:38.648 --> 09:40.749
in their homes and protecting
their civil rights.

09:40.784 --> 09:42.917
Well, then give him the
Congressional medal of honor

09:42.953 --> 09:45.687
and dismiss this case because
he still missed the deadline.

09:45.722 --> 09:48.455
And it's within my power
to extend it, Mr. Collins.

09:48.456 --> 09:50.735
So if your company
did nothing wrong,

09:50.736 --> 09:52.069
you have nothing
to worry about.

09:52.104 --> 09:53.937
Because this case
is moving to trial.

09:53.973 --> 09:56.040
Your Honor,
this action is nothing more

09:56.075 --> 09:58.020
than a backdoor attempt
to get our former partners

09:58.044 --> 09:59.677
their buy-ins back.
- Where's your proof?

09:59.712 --> 10:01.679
I'll tell you where.
You helped us rewrite

10:01.714 --> 10:04.648
our bylaws to stop this claim.
Now, you're using the statement

10:04.684 --> 10:07.840
you made us issue to revive
that very same claim.

10:08.038 --> 10:09.316
Every one of these
former partners

10:09.340 --> 10:10.672
suffered damage
to their career

10:10.708 --> 10:12.908
due to their association
with a firm that hired a fraud,

10:12.943 --> 10:14.509
and you know it.
- Wow, Stanley.

10:14.545 --> 10:16.456
Isn't it convenient that all
you have to back that up

10:16.480 --> 10:17.490
is the word
of the very same partners

10:17.514 --> 10:18.280
that'll say anything
they have to

10:18.315 --> 10:20.501

10:20.502 --> 10:21.546
I'm glad
you brought that up, Louis.

10:21.570 --> 10:23.670
Because I happen
to have the statement

10:23.705 --> 10:25.683
of a former partner who's not
a part of this lawsuit at all.

10:25.707 --> 10:26.884
What the hell
are you talking about?

10:26.908 --> 10:29.108
Your Honor,
this is a court transcript

10:29.144 --> 10:31.455

former partner of their firm.

10:31.479 --> 10:32.590
I'd like to draw your attention
to the section

10:32.614 --> 10:34.380

having

10:34.416 --> 10:36.382
her credibility questioned
as a direct result

10:36.418 --> 10:38.184
of working at Pearson Specter.

10:38.219 --> 10:40.328
Your Honor, there must be
some other explanation for--

10:40.329 --> 10:41.606
Then get her ass
in here to give it.

10:41.630 --> 10:43.497

- That's enough.

34:34.110 --> 34:35.815
Then we keep looking
until we do.

34:35.817 --> 34:37.328
Harvey, has it
occurred to you it's possible

34:37.329 --> 34:38.539
that this isn't
the worst outcome in the world?

34:38.563 --> 34:42.232
Yeah, and I could also
get shot in the face.

34:42.266 --> 34:43.511
But that's not what
we're talking about right now.

34:43.534 --> 34:45.735
I'm saying, let Gordon think
he pressured us

34:45.770 --> 34:47.648
into taking those partners
back, because the truth is,

34:47.672 --> 34:49.117
we're a more powerful firm
if they're here.

34:49.141 --> 34:53.009
And you and I both know if
Stanley Gordon wants them back,

34:53.043 --> 34:55.078
he wants it for a reason,
and it sure as hell

34:55.112 --> 34:57.013
isn't to help us out.
- I have some information,

34:57.047 --> 34:58.214
but I don't know if it has

34:58.250 --> 34:59.649
anything to do
with this or not.

34:59.684 --> 35:00.850
What is it?

35:00.886 --> 35:03.253
Last week, when we
almost lost our lease,

35:03.288 --> 35:05.522
I did some checking
in case we had to move, and--

35:05.557 --> 35:07.457
Hold on, I'm sorry.
We almost lost our lease?

35:07.492 --> 35:08.736
That's not the point, Louis.
I took care of it.

35:08.760 --> 35:10.760
The point is
there were three floors

35:10.795 --> 35:12.827
in Robert Zane's building
listed as vacant,

35:12.828 --> 35:14.795
but when I looked
into renting them,

35:14.830 --> 35:17.698
they were no longer available,
because as it turns out,

35:17.733 --> 35:19.700
Rand Kaldor Zane is expanding.

35:19.735 --> 35:21.134
- That can't be.
- Harvey's right.

35:21.170 --> 35:22.314
For those partners
to come back here,

35:22.338 --> 35:25.272
Zane would need
to waive their non-competes.

35:25.307 --> 35:27.441
Why would he do that at the
same time he's expanding?

35:27.476 --> 35:29.176
I don't know,
but three floors

35:29.211 --> 35:32.112
is exactly
how much space we use.

35:32.147 --> 35:33.280
Holy shit.

35:33.315 --> 35:35.449
Gordon really doesn't
want to take over.

35:35.484 --> 35:38.051
He just wants to orchestrate a
deal where his guys come back,

35:38.087 --> 35:40.954
they vote to merge with Zane,
and we cease to exist.

35:40.990 --> 35:43.557
That's not possible.
Our by-laws prevent that.

35:43.592 --> 35:45.325
No, Harvey, they don't.

35:45.361 --> 35:47.160
And I've been focusing
on the wrong thing.

35:47.196 --> 35:48.795
He doesn't need
to be managing partner

35:48.831 --> 35:50.964
for them to outvote us on this.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.200
Harvey, if that's true,

35:53.235 --> 35:56.103
Zane would have to be in on it.
