NARRATOR: <i>Previously on</i> Boston Legal...

00:02.669 --> 00:06.423
-I'm just trying to get an erection!
-Well, who knows? Maybe it's the mad cow.

00:06.506 --> 00:08.967
(gasps) My penis has Alzheimer's.

00:09.634 --> 00:11.386
-ALAN: Phoebe.
-Alan.

00:11.803 --> 00:14.431
Why drag this out beyond a time
we're still attracted to each other?

00:14.514 --> 00:18.059
-I'm not attracted to you now.
-Fine. Let's go with that.

00:18.143 --> 00:19.394
-ALAN: Phoebe.
-What happened?

00:19.477 --> 00:21.688
-I was in love with her.
-That'll kill the moment.

00:21.771 --> 00:25.942
And she loved me, just... not enough.

00:26.026 --> 00:28.987
-Maybe it's not too late.
-She's happily married with children.

00:32.574 --> 00:34.284
(pounding on door)

00:35.744 --> 00:36.745
(Denny snoring)

00:42.208 --> 00:43.168
(knocking on door)

00:48.131 --> 00:49.591
-(pounding on door)
-(snorts)

00:50.675 --> 00:52.010
(squeaks) <i>Denny Crane.</i>

00:52.927 --> 00:54.137
(pounding on door)

01:04.606 --> 01:07.275
(both screaming)

01:07.609 --> 01:09.402
-What are you doing?
-I got scared.

01:09.486 --> 01:11.071
-Of what?
-I heard banging.

01:11.446 --> 01:12.781
-What banging?
-(knocking on door)

01:13.990 --> 01:15.825
-That banging.
-That's a knock.

01:16.451 --> 01:17.869
-Answer it.
-Me?

01:18.161 --> 01:19.329
-You heard it.
-You live here.

01:20.455 --> 01:21.748
-(knocking on door)
-(gasps)

01:23.792 --> 01:25.376
Never mind. We'll both answer it.

01:29.130 --> 01:30.131
(pounding on door)

01:31.633 --> 01:32.634
(squeaks)

01:35.929 --> 01:37.222
(knocking on door)

01:39.057 --> 01:40.850
(pounding on door)

01:44.145 --> 01:46.856
-Phoebe.
-Can I talk to you, Alan? It's important.

01:48.108 --> 01:50.693
-What's going on?
-The police just arrested my husband.

01:51.027 --> 01:52.779
They-they showed up
in the middle of the night.

01:52.862 --> 01:55.990
I tried to call you, but-but I guess
your phones are turned off, so...

01:56.449 --> 01:58.827
-Arrested him for what?
-Murder.

01:59.285 --> 02:00.578
-(gasps)
-Murder?

02:00.662 --> 02:03.248
-(whispers) Murder?
-You're the best lawyer that I know.

02:03.957 --> 02:06.000
-So will you help?
-Who's he accused of killing?

02:06.626 --> 02:07.460
One of his nurses.

02:08.336 --> 02:10.922
I'm sorry, Alan.
But this is my family here.

02:11.005 --> 02:12.590
I... I need you.

02:15.218 --> 02:16.511
This is gonna be a good one.

02:16.594 --> 02:20.223
(theme music playing)

02:21.975 --> 02:23.351
<i>Uh-huh</i>

02:24.894 --> 02:25.812
<i>Aw</i>

02:26.688 --> 02:27.814
<i>- All right</i>
-Ooh.

02:28.898 --> 02:29.732
<i>Come on</i>

02:31.025 --> 02:31.860
<i>Oh</i>

02:33.570 --> 02:35.446
<i>Come on, all right</i>

02:36.072 --> 02:36.906
<i>Well, yeah</i>

02:39.409 --> 02:40.326
<i>Well, yeah</i>

02:46.416 --> 02:47.792
<i>Outlaw</i>

02:48.334 --> 02:49.544
So he's in custody now?

02:50.253 --> 02:52.088
Yeah, they're arraigning him first up.
(sighs)

02:52.172 --> 02:54.966
It's my opinion they purposely
arrested him at night.

02:55.341 --> 02:57.927
The District Attorney
involved loves gamesmanship,

02:58.011 --> 03:00.013
so you'll have your work cut out for you.

03:00.096 --> 03:01.723
(rooster crows)

03:05.643 --> 03:07.228
Can we talk about the case itself?

03:07.979 --> 03:12.317
Well, my husband is one of the leading
cardiologists at Boston General.

03:12.400 --> 03:15.862
Oh, isn't he special? Sorry.

03:17.030 --> 03:20.241
Uh, the victim
is one of his former nurses.

03:20.617 --> 03:22.827
She was found poisoned to death.

03:22.911 --> 03:25.455
They claim that he was having
an affair with her. He wasn't.

03:26.039 --> 03:29.667
He had, briefly, in the past,
but it was long over.

03:29.751 --> 03:31.753
(rooster crows)

03:33.588 --> 03:35.006
ALAN: I'm sorry.
Could you excuse us for a second?

03:35.089 --> 03:36.507
I'll be right back. Denny.

03:38.134 --> 03:39.844
-What the hell is that?
-What?

03:39.928 --> 03:41.512
The rooster noise,
and don't pretend you don't know

03:41.596 --> 03:42.597
-what I'm talking about.
-I don't know what you're talking about.

03:42.680 --> 03:44.515
Denny, it's coming from you.
What the hell is it?

03:45.600 --> 03:49.729
Well... you remember that little,
uh, uh, uh...

03:49.812 --> 03:52.190
-uh, blood flow issue I had?
-Yeah.

03:52.398 --> 03:55.526
The doctor has hooked me up to a monitor.
I'm supposed to keep a journal.

03:55.610 --> 03:59.656
Any kind of blood flow,
I'm supposed to make a note.

04:00.823 --> 04:01.824
-A monitor?
-Yeah.

04:01.908 --> 04:03.660
-Connected to--
-(shushes) Yeah.

04:03.952 --> 04:05.578
-One that sounds like a rooster?
-That's just my ringtone.

04:06.162 --> 04:07.413
You can choose from many.

04:07.747 --> 04:09.791
Look, obviously this is a serious case.

04:09.874 --> 04:12.168
-That's why the doctor wants--
-I'm talking about the murder.

04:14.337 --> 04:16.422
I do not want to be hearing
from that thing.

04:16.506 --> 04:18.841
-Are you listening to me?
-I'll put it on vibrate.

04:23.346 --> 04:25.765
I'm sorry. So, uh...

04:26.641 --> 04:28.768
-The arraignment's tomorrow morning.
-First up.

04:29.310 --> 04:33.523
The thing is, Alan, they found evidence
of him being present at her house.

04:33.606 --> 04:36.526
Now he was there a week ago,
but not on the night of the murder.

04:37.527 --> 04:38.611
Which was when?

04:38.695 --> 04:41.531
Two nights ago. I... I'm surprised
you haven't heard about it.

04:41.823 --> 04:43.074
It's been all over the news.

04:43.366 --> 04:45.576
I mean, he is the top cardiologist
at Boston General.

04:45.660 --> 04:46.661
Yes, you mentioned that.

04:47.537 --> 04:50.290
You say he once had an affair
with the victim.

04:50.623 --> 04:52.375
A while ago, yes, but it was over.

04:52.750 --> 04:54.752
Well, if it was over,
why was he at her house a week ago?

04:54.836 --> 04:57.880
He said that she was distraught,
and he went there to calm her down.

04:59.507 --> 05:01.384
-And you believe that?
-I do.

05:02.135 --> 05:04.012
-Okay.
-Plus, he has an alibi.

05:04.887 --> 05:06.389
-Which is?
-Me.

05:07.557 --> 05:09.183
He never left the house two nights ago.

05:09.684 --> 05:14.105
-Ah. You're sure?
-Positive.

05:18.526 --> 05:22.071
-Hello.
-(monitor buzzing)

05:23.197 --> 05:26.743

05:43.551 --> 05:45.511
-(elevator bell dings)
-(clamoring)

05:45.595 --> 05:47.430
Please excuse us.
I have absolutely no comment.

05:47.513 --> 05:50.099
I have a comment.
If you'll go to DennyCranelaw.com...

05:50.183 --> 05:52.852
Please, I will ask you to respect
my privacy.

05:52.935 --> 05:54.687
This is obviously a very difficult time.

05:54.771 --> 05:57.648
I can say unequivocally
that my husband is innocent.

05:57.732 --> 05:59.776
-If you'll excuse us.
-(camera shutters clicking)

06:00.318 --> 06:02.320
I'd advise you not to talk to the press.

06:02.570 --> 06:04.906
The D.A. Is trying this case in the media,
Alan--

06:04.989 --> 06:06.657
Even so. I mean, will you look at this?

06:06.741 --> 06:09.702
Well, it's very high-profile.
My husband is the leading cardiologist--

06:09.786 --> 06:12.955
All right already. Sorry.

06:13.039 --> 06:17.919
All rise. This court is now in session.
The honorable Judge Beacon presiding.

06:22.590 --> 06:26.177
JUDGE BEACON: Let's be clear right now.
This is a courtroom, not a circus.

06:26.260 --> 06:28.763
Anyone breaking its decorum
is going to get spanked

06:28.846 --> 06:31.891
-by me personally.
-(monitor buzzing)

06:31.974 --> 06:32.892
JUDGE BEACON:
The clerk will call the case.

06:33.226 --> 06:36.354
MAN: Number 32859.
<i>Commonwealth v. Robert L. Brooks</i>

06:36.437 --> 06:38.106
on the felony count of murder
in the first degree.

06:38.856 --> 06:41.234
ALAN: Good morning, Your Honor.
Alan Shore for the defense.

06:41.317 --> 06:43.986
My goodness. What a splendid turnout.

06:44.070 --> 06:46.864
We'll waive reading of the charges
and enter a plea of not guilty.

06:47.281 --> 06:50.535
I'd ask that you release my client
on his own recognizance pending trial.

06:50.618 --> 06:52.453
My client is a respected doctor.

06:52.537 --> 06:54.997
In fact, I'm told he's
the top cardiologist at Boston--

06:55.081 --> 06:57.125
STEWART: Stewart Betts representing
the State, Your Honor. Good morning.

06:57.500 --> 07:00.461
We do not typically afford bail
to first-degree murderers.

07:00.545 --> 07:03.089
My client has well-established roots
in the Boston community.

07:03.172 --> 07:06.884
He's certainly not a flight risk.
He has no prior criminal record.

07:06.968 --> 07:09.512
His being at large poses
no real risk to society.

07:09.595 --> 07:13.516
I don't know about Mr. Shore, Your Honor,
but I think that the rest of the public

07:13.599 --> 07:16.269
would consider a murderer, any murderer,

07:16.352 --> 07:20.314
especially this murderer,
a devious murderer, to be a risk.

07:20.398 --> 07:24.277
I'm sorry. Did you use the word "murderer"
four or five times in that sentence?

07:24.360 --> 07:25.236
I'd hate to misquote you.

07:25.319 --> 07:27.238
Mr. Shore,
would you like to be disciplined?

07:27.697 --> 07:29.615
(monitor buzzing)

07:29.991 --> 07:32.201
Given the sophisticated methodology
of this murder,

07:32.285 --> 07:34.078
making it appear like a heart attack,

07:34.162 --> 07:37.748
I'm persuaded that the defendant possesses
the requisite craftiness

07:37.832 --> 07:41.419
to indeed escape this jurisdiction
with little effort if he so chooses.

07:41.502 --> 07:44.547
-Gee, that sounded impartial.
-Bail is denied.

07:44.630 --> 07:46.924
The defendant shall return to custody.
We are adjourned.

07:47.008 --> 07:47.842
(gavel banging)

07:48.509 --> 07:49.969
ALAN:
I'll be back to meet with you shortly.

07:50.052 --> 07:52.346
In the meantime,
please do not speak to anyone.

07:52.430 --> 07:53.264
Well done on bail.

07:56.142 --> 08:00.313
He can be a bit chilly at first, but...
Should we go and meet him?

08:01.147 --> 08:04.192
-I'd like to sit with him alone, please.
-Why?

08:04.275 --> 08:06.944
Because I would.
I like to get a feel for those I defend.

08:07.028 --> 08:09.280
Denny, you need to stop
your penis from humming.

08:10.448 --> 08:12.867
-Oh.
-(cell door bangs)

08:14.202 --> 08:17.747
-(jail alarm blaring)
-(lock clanking)

08:17.830 --> 08:18.706
Thank you.

08:19.916 --> 08:22.502
-You want me to stay?
-I think I'm good.

08:23.002 --> 08:26.255
-You don't plan to kill me, do you?
-We'll see how it goes.

08:28.132 --> 08:29.926
(door slams, clatters)

08:31.636 --> 08:35.515
-So is it Robert or Bob?
-Robert.

08:36.516 --> 08:37.642
So, what can you tell me, Bob?

08:39.685 --> 08:43.105
I'm innocent. I did have
a short-lived relationship with her,

08:43.189 --> 08:46.817
which I broke off
to her less-than-concealed dismay.

08:48.194 --> 08:51.572
-When you say "short-lived"?
-Seventeen days last Autumn.

08:52.865 --> 08:56.619
-She was your nurse?
-One of my nurses, yes.

08:58.871 --> 09:00.623
What occasioned the end of the affair?

09:02.333 --> 09:04.544
You're not curious
as to what precipitated the beginning?

09:04.961 --> 09:07.964
I've seen a picture of her.
I can fill in that blank.

09:13.386 --> 09:17.598
Well, the affair's end was occasioned
by Miss Goulet's emotional instability.

09:18.432 --> 09:20.184
She was becoming increasingly erratic,

09:20.268 --> 09:23.020
causing an unacceptable distraction
for me at work.

09:23.563 --> 09:26.649
I severed the relationship
and I sought to create a distance.

09:28.025 --> 09:29.068
She was persistent.

09:29.819 --> 09:31.445
I never saw her romantically again.

09:31.529 --> 09:33.948
I most certainly did not go to her home
the evening of her death,

09:34.031 --> 09:39.662
and I played no role whatsoever
in her death. Questions?

09:42.081 --> 09:44.125
(clicks tongue)
According to the incident report,

09:44.208 --> 09:46.460
you were seen by a neighbor
at her house that night.

09:46.877 --> 09:47.878
Neighbor's mistaken.

09:49.297 --> 09:51.674
I was there several days
before the murder.

09:51.757 --> 09:54.844
I had gone in an attempt to defuse
her emotions.

09:55.636 --> 09:59.307
I was not there on the murder night,
which my wife will confirm.

10:00.891 --> 10:03.561
Well, wives have been known to lie
for their husbands.

10:05.313 --> 10:07.064
The jury will find my wife
very persuasive.

10:09.942 --> 10:11.944
Don't you find her impressive, Mr. Shore?

10:12.028 --> 10:16.532
(intense music playing)

10:17.116 --> 10:19.535
Denny, if this case comes down
to his testimony...

10:21.245 --> 10:24.373
(scoffs) He's incredibly unlikable.

10:25.958 --> 10:28.586
-All worked out then, didn't it?
-What do you mean?

10:28.919 --> 10:30.963
Alan, you didn't really want to like
this guy, did you?

10:31.047 --> 10:32.840
-No, but I do want to win the case.
-Really?

10:34.050 --> 10:35.009
Of course, really.

10:35.926 --> 10:38.888
What, do you think I'd purposely lose
so I could be with his wife?

10:39.513 --> 10:40.890
-I would.
-You would not.

10:42.058 --> 10:46.103
-Your true love is your undefeated record.
-And your true love is her.

10:49.440 --> 10:50.358
You know, Denny...

10:54.403 --> 10:58.658
I must admit,
from time to time through the years,

10:58.741 --> 11:01.869
in... various cases...

11:04.622 --> 11:09.627
I've secretly fantasized that she was
in the back of the room, watching.

11:10.336 --> 11:14.715
(laughs) Everything we do
is all about impressing the girl,

11:14.799 --> 11:16.133
even when the girl isn't there.

11:16.217 --> 11:19.470
But here, she will be there, watching me.

11:21.806 --> 11:23.224
Relying on me, even.

11:25.393 --> 11:29.939
Alan, look at me. At first,
I thought this would be fun, exciting.

11:31.941 --> 11:34.068
Now I'm telling you as your best friend,
get out.

11:35.403 --> 11:39.490
In defeat, you lose, disappointing
the one woman you've really loved.

11:41.075 --> 11:44.829
In victory,
she walks away with her husband...

11:48.624 --> 11:49.500
which isn't you.

12:04.932 --> 12:07.727
Okay, at first the coroner ruled
natural causes,

12:07.810 --> 12:11.272
and you can pretty much see why.
Not a mark on her.

12:11.355 --> 12:16.193
Except for this mole here.
It's spectacular. Can I touch it? H--

12:18.904 --> 12:22.324
But once they tumbled to the affair,
they decided to look again.

12:22.992 --> 12:24.285
That's when they found this.

12:25.911 --> 12:29.707
You can see the needle mark here
on the thigh. Succinylcholine.

12:30.040 --> 12:33.836
The beauty is, it basically disappears
from the system within minutes.

12:33.919 --> 12:36.756
And best of all,
the symptoms mimic a heart attack.

12:36.839 --> 12:39.884
-And it kills you immediately?
-First paralysis, then death.

12:40.509 --> 12:42.553
It's likely she woke up
when she got jabbed,

12:42.636 --> 12:44.472
but going into paralysis,

12:44.555 --> 12:45.681
-nothing she could do.
-Wow.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.975
Except watch her killer walk out the door.

12:48.768 --> 12:49.602
Any semen?

12:50.019 --> 12:52.772
-Not yet.
-(monitor buzzing)

12:54.190 --> 12:55.274
No semen was found.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.276
Saliva or hair?

12:57.359 --> 13:00.696
Nothing found on the body.
Almost the perfect crime.

13:01.655 --> 13:03.532
Whoever did this was one smart guy.

13:07.453 --> 13:11.040
The neighbor's house is here,
meaning his sight line is this way,

13:11.123 --> 13:14.919
which basically means he'd see cars from
the front given the curve of the street.

13:15.002 --> 13:16.212
What's the lighting like?

13:17.129 --> 13:19.632
Well, a street lamp here,
so it's not great.

13:20.257 --> 13:21.592
So if we can shake this witness,

13:21.675 --> 13:24.094
then everything else
is completely circumstantial, right?

13:25.221 --> 13:27.306
Phoebe, they can place him
at the scene with forensics.

13:27.598 --> 13:29.850
-Not that night.
-No, the neighbor does that.

13:31.060 --> 13:33.062
Your husband had a romantic history
with the victim.

13:33.145 --> 13:34.939
The victim's mother will testify

13:35.022 --> 13:36.315
-as to threats he made.
-She's lying.

13:36.398 --> 13:37.858
Yes, according to your husband.

13:39.193 --> 13:41.862
Whoever did this clearly
has medical expertise.

13:41.946 --> 13:43.656
-Add to that...
-Add to that what?

13:45.407 --> 13:46.617
The jury will hate him.

13:48.953 --> 13:49.787
Meaning you hate him.

13:51.288 --> 13:53.290
-My feelings aren't relevant.
-Oh, come on, Alan.

13:54.458 --> 13:55.751
Your feelings aren't in play here?

13:57.878 --> 14:00.631
-(scoffs)
-(sighs)

14:01.507 --> 14:03.717
I think that if you look
at this case clinically,

14:03.801 --> 14:06.554
you will appreciate
that the prosecution's case is very weak.

14:07.263 --> 14:11.809
The evidence is all circumstantial.
The victim had other affairs.

14:11.892 --> 14:14.395
-Which we can't prove.
-And my husband has an alibi.

14:15.896 --> 14:19.817
The testimony of a devoted wife
is rarely winning.

14:20.985 --> 14:23.821
I don't think the jury will believe you.

14:26.198 --> 14:27.157
Do you believe me?

14:31.787 --> 14:34.874
No. I know you.

14:35.666 --> 14:38.127
You would never forgive him
for having the affair.

14:41.005 --> 14:42.965
In fact, if memory serves me,
you can be...

14:44.383 --> 14:45.843
quite punishing on that subject.

14:45.926 --> 14:48.012
It's different when you have kids.

14:48.095 --> 14:50.306
Yes, and your children
need their father around.

14:50.973 --> 14:54.143
So you're willing to do whatever you can
to keep him out of jail,

14:54.226 --> 14:56.562
including lie for him
in the witness chair.

14:58.147 --> 15:01.358
-You're wrong.
-I don't think so.

15:04.945 --> 15:08.324
Well, clearly...
I need to get another attorney.

15:14.622 --> 15:17.124
-If we agree to plead to manslaughter--
-Absolutely not.

15:18.626 --> 15:19.877
That's your husband's decision.

15:19.960 --> 15:24.256
And I know exactly what that will be.
There will be no guilty plea.

15:26.050 --> 15:29.929
This wasn't a...
heat of passion crime, Phoebe.

15:30.179 --> 15:35.267
It was... calculated... cold.

15:38.646 --> 15:39.480
Do you trust this man?

15:42.608 --> 15:46.403
-How about around your children?
-He would never hurt the children.

15:48.822 --> 15:51.200
And he did not... commit this crime,

15:51.283 --> 15:54.662
however much you're determined
to believe otherwise.

16:02.836 --> 16:03.921
You still love me, Alan.

16:06.924 --> 16:08.008
As do I you.

16:12.012 --> 16:13.138
You... (sighs)

16:14.264 --> 16:18.143
You don't think that I want to believe
that he's guilty sometimes?

16:19.895 --> 16:21.230
It would be so easy to.

16:21.313 --> 16:26.360
I mean... I am still angry
over the affair. Of course, I am.

16:27.820 --> 16:30.280
And sometimes,
I think it would just be easier if I...

16:32.074 --> 16:33.742
If I just ditched everything and...

16:35.160 --> 16:36.161
including him...

16:38.288 --> 16:40.124
And took off to some island with...

16:41.041 --> 16:42.876
with an old boyfriend that I've never...

16:45.087 --> 16:47.715
-Don't.
-(clicks tongue, clears throat)

16:48.007 --> 16:49.717
(softly) Do not make that mistake.

16:52.344 --> 16:55.305
You need to protect yourself, Alan.

16:57.433 --> 17:02.479
Because when this trial is over...
I will be walking away with him.

17:06.150 --> 17:08.777
My family is my life.

17:20.497 --> 17:23.208
I know she was afraid of him
because she told me so.

17:23.625 --> 17:26.920
She was in a very excitable state
when she did so.

17:27.296 --> 17:30.215
She said,
"Mom, I'm scared to death of him."

17:30.758 --> 17:32.968
Why did your daughter fear the defendant,
Mrs. Goulet?

17:33.969 --> 17:36.513
She threatened to tell his wife
that they had resumed the affair.

17:36.597 --> 17:37.765
(people gasps, murmurs)

17:37.848 --> 17:38.932
STEWART:
What else did your daughter tell you?

17:39.016 --> 17:44.521
She said he said,
"If you do tell her, you will pay for it."

17:46.482 --> 17:48.317
(paper rattling)

17:48.400 --> 17:51.445
Very dramatic.
Probably see it on the news.

17:51.820 --> 17:52.654
You like being on the news?

17:52.946 --> 17:55.949
Oh, you think I enjoy talking about
my daughter's murder?

17:56.033 --> 17:58.160
-Well, I see you a lot on TV.
-Almost as much as him.

17:58.452 --> 17:59.661
-Not that much.
-You're right.

17:59.745 --> 18:02.498
-(gavel bangs)
-(monitor buzzing)

18:02.915 --> 18:04.958
Uh, Phyllis. May I call you Phyllis?

18:05.042 --> 18:07.503
-(gavel bangs)
-(monitor buzzing)

18:07.836 --> 18:08.879
(whispers) Oh, my God.

18:09.755 --> 18:12.174
Uh, when your, uh, daughter told you

18:12.257 --> 18:14.510
that she feared my client,
were you worried?

18:14.968 --> 18:16.345
(scoffs) Of course, I was.

18:16.428 --> 18:17.679
DENNY: Did you tell anybody?
Surely you told somebody?

18:18.263 --> 18:20.891
A friend, a relative,
a mental health specialist?

18:21.225 --> 18:22.392
-Objection.
-Overruled.

18:22.893 --> 18:25.854
Phyllis, did you make up
this little story?

18:26.230 --> 18:29.942
(scoffs) No, I did not.
You're a disgusting person.

18:32.444 --> 18:34.238
I don't like being called disgusting.

18:35.322 --> 18:37.616
Did you ever call
your daughter disgusting?

18:38.700 --> 18:39.701
Of course not.

18:42.496 --> 18:44.915
I have a copy of a letter here
that you wrote to your daughter

18:44.998 --> 18:46.166
shortly before her death.

18:47.459 --> 18:49.962
The, uh, prosecution has the letter,

18:50.045 --> 18:53.215
and they mistakenly forgot to produce it
during discovery. Oversight.

18:54.174 --> 18:57.052
Would you read the highlighted section,
please?

18:57.678 --> 18:59.138
And don't forget to project.

18:59.221 --> 19:01.306
-There's a camera back there.
-Objection.

19:04.601 --> 19:07.896
The highlighted section, please.

19:13.277 --> 19:14.236
"You never call.

19:14.820 --> 19:17.114
You're too busy running around
with all your married men.

19:18.407 --> 19:24.204
You're a disgraceful, disgusting whore."

19:24.663 --> 19:28.208
(people murmuring)

19:30.169 --> 19:32.671
No evidence of anybody else
being present in the home

19:32.754 --> 19:34.715
except for the victim and the defendant.

19:35.007 --> 19:37.467
Sounds like sloppy work for the defendant
to leave his prints behind.

19:37.801 --> 19:38.927
DOCTOR: He didn't. Not really.

19:39.011 --> 19:41.388
We only found
a few old prints here and there.

19:41.638 --> 19:44.892
The crime scene was otherwise
conspicuously meticulous.

19:45.767 --> 19:48.812
It causes cardiac arrest,
ventricular dysrhythmia.

19:49.563 --> 19:53.400
It quickly degrades. It's very difficult
to detect after a few hours.

19:53.483 --> 19:55.402
Sounds like the perfect drug
if you're looking to get away with murder.

19:56.945 --> 19:57.988
It is.

19:58.071 --> 19:59.948
She never told me she was afraid of him,

20:00.032 --> 20:03.452
but she did she say she was thinking about
telling his wife about the affair.

20:03.827 --> 20:05.662
Were there other men to your knowledge?

20:05.746 --> 20:07.748
WOMAN:
There were certainly rumors of others.

20:07.831 --> 20:09.958
She, of course,
never brought them around the hospital.

20:10.042 --> 20:12.169
MAN: I'd seen his car many times.

20:12.252 --> 20:14.254
And you saw it the night of the murder?

20:14.338 --> 20:21.053
Yes. I'd gotten up to go to the bathroom.
I looked out the window. I saw it.

20:21.428 --> 20:22.971
You first told the police
you weren't sure.

20:23.472 --> 20:27.476
MAN: Well, it had happened a few days
earlier, and I had to think back.

20:27.559 --> 20:30.520
I-I did, and I am sure
I saw it that night.

20:31.104 --> 20:33.815
-Hmm.
-Ever see any other cars

20:33.899 --> 20:35.692
go into that driveway on other nights?

20:36.068 --> 20:38.320
Oh, many times.

20:38.403 --> 20:44.243
Um, Miss Goulet had a very...
diverse recreational life.

20:46.870 --> 20:48.580
What do you mean I shouldn't testify?

20:49.373 --> 20:51.166
My feeling is it would be a disaster.

20:52.459 --> 20:54.836
The prosecution would pick you apart
over the affair.

20:55.128 --> 20:57.256
All you can do, really,
is say that you didn't go

20:57.339 --> 21:00.342
to the victim's house that night,
and we have Phoebe to say that.

21:01.927 --> 21:04.888
Well, I'm not an attorney,
but I would think at a minimum,

21:04.972 --> 21:08.558
a defendant need take the stand to deny
the crime for which he is charged.

21:08.642 --> 21:09.559
You would be wrong.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.854
DENNY: Come on. You're guilty as sin.
You don't fool us.

21:12.938 --> 21:15.399
You won't fool a jury.
Stop being such a baby.

21:17.359 --> 21:19.528
Tell me, Bob, had you resumed the affair?

21:23.156 --> 21:26.410
-Just a yes or no question.
-No.

21:28.161 --> 21:29.663
I think we'll skip your testimony.

21:30.580 --> 21:32.165
Are you in love with my wife, Mr. Shore?

21:35.168 --> 21:36.878
Just a yes or no question.

21:49.141 --> 21:51.393
He strikes me as a very difficult man
to love.

21:54.062 --> 21:56.732
(clicks tongue)
Well, that seems to be my curse.

21:56.815 --> 21:59.109
I fall for difficult men.

22:03.613 --> 22:06.241
-It doesn't look good, does it?
-It looks terrible.

22:09.995 --> 22:11.413
We've still got reasonable doubt.

22:15.042 --> 22:18.086
Phoebe, our entire defense is you.

22:19.421 --> 22:21.631
You have to persuade the jury tomorrow.

22:22.632 --> 22:24.634
And I'm sorry, but I have to say this,

22:24.843 --> 22:27.012
you need to do a much better job
persuading them

22:27.095 --> 22:28.805
than you have so far persuading me.

22:31.600 --> 22:32.559
Or me.

22:43.779 --> 22:45.447
The Robert Brooks trial winds down today

22:45.530 --> 22:48.575
with the defendant's wife,
Phoebe Prentice, taking the stand.

22:48.742 --> 22:52.537
She's of course expected to say
that her husband never left the house

22:52.621 --> 22:53.830
on the night of Isabelle Goulet's murder.

22:53.914 --> 22:55.624
(elevator bell dings)

22:55.707 --> 22:57.167
-Denny Crane. Step aside.
-FEMALE REPORTER: Mr. Crane!

22:57.250 --> 22:59.878
Not wearing underwear. Not pretty.
No comment.

23:00.462 --> 23:02.047
You swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth

23:02.130 --> 23:04.091
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

23:04.174 --> 23:05.300
-I do.
-Be seated.

23:09.930 --> 23:12.099
Mrs. Prentice,
you're married to the defendant,

23:12.182 --> 23:14.059
-Dr. Robert Brooks?
-I am.

23:14.142 --> 23:16.728
-And how long have you been so?
-Sixteen years.

23:17.604 --> 23:21.274
I imagine this has been quite an ordeal
for you.

23:22.275 --> 23:24.778
-Yes.
-Do you love your husband?

23:26.321 --> 23:27.155
Very much.

23:28.615 --> 23:31.410
So in the interest of fairness,
it should be said,

23:31.493 --> 23:34.704
-you have a strong bias here.
-I do.

23:35.539 --> 23:39.251
Not with standing that bias,
you understand that your testimony today

23:39.334 --> 23:41.837
is subject to the pains
and penalties of perjury?

23:43.004 --> 23:43.839
I do.

23:44.214 --> 23:45.841
ALAN: Then let's cut right to the chase,
shall we?

23:45.924 --> 23:47.551
Because we're all dying to know,

23:47.717 --> 23:50.762
where were you on the night
Isabelle Goulet was murdered?

23:51.847 --> 23:54.933
Well, I arrived home from work
a little after seven o'clock,

23:55.016 --> 23:56.852
which was my routine.

23:56.935 --> 24:01.398
We like to have dinner as a family. It's
a ritual we're very conscientious about.

24:01.481 --> 24:04.317
-You, your husband and your two children?
-That's right.

24:04.860 --> 24:07.320
-And after dinner?
-My kids did their homework.

24:07.404 --> 24:11.491
It was a school night.
And Robert did some work in his den,

24:11.575 --> 24:14.744
and I think that I did some laundry
or something.

24:14.828 --> 24:18.039
Um... then at about ten o'clock,
my kids went to bed.

24:18.123 --> 24:23.587
And... Robert and I had a glass of wine,
we watched some news.

24:23.670 --> 24:28.592
And, uh... then he took a sleeping pill,
which he invariably does,

24:28.675 --> 24:32.679
and we went to sleep.
It was pretty uneventful.

24:33.388 --> 24:35.807
-You stayed in all night?
-That's correct.

24:36.391 --> 24:38.059
Did your husband leave the house?

24:50.906 --> 24:52.866
Mrs. Prentice,
did your husband leave the house?

25:00.874 --> 25:04.544
I'm sorry, Your Honor.
Uh... could I please take a short break?

25:04.628 --> 25:06.838
JUDGE BEACON: No, I-I think you should
answer the question, ma'am.

25:06.922 --> 25:08.715
Did your husband
leave the house that night?

25:17.724 --> 25:21.728
-Yes.
-(people murmuring)

25:21.811 --> 25:24.105
Your Honor, I'd like a short recess
to confer with my client.

25:24.189 --> 25:26.650
Not gonna happen. When did he leave?

25:28.026 --> 25:29.069
I don't know. I, uh...

25:31.321 --> 25:32.614
I woke up after midnight.

25:33.615 --> 25:34.741
Your Honor,
I need to confer with my client.

25:34.824 --> 25:35.825
Mr. Shore, be quiet.

25:36.952 --> 25:38.036
Do you know where he went?

25:42.916 --> 25:43.750
No, I did not know.

25:46.419 --> 25:47.295
When did he get home?

25:49.297 --> 25:50.382
Sometime after 3:00.

25:51.800 --> 25:53.260
Your honor, this is unfair surprise. She--

25:53.343 --> 25:54.511
-It's your witness.
-I don't care.

25:54.594 --> 25:56.596
We're fast approaching grounds
for a mistrial.

25:56.680 --> 25:58.431
You need to give me a recess.

26:00.684 --> 26:01.518
All right.

26:01.601 --> 26:03.228
-We're going to take a one-hour break.
-(gavel bangs)

26:04.688 --> 26:07.399
-What the hell was that?
-I am so sorry.

26:07.482 --> 26:09.401
If your intent was to bury him,
why'd you hire me?

26:09.484 --> 26:12.821
To reconnect, so you'd be there for her
when her husband went off to jail.

26:13.113 --> 26:14.531
-PHOEBE: That isn't true.
-DENNY: Yes, it is.

26:14.614 --> 26:16.157
You love Alan. Do you deny it?

26:18.201 --> 26:21.580
I hired Alan to secure my husband's
freedom. That was my intent.

26:21.663 --> 26:25.125
I wanted to preserve my family
at whatever cost.

26:25.208 --> 26:26.209
So, what changed?

26:28.461 --> 26:33.592
Well, I suddenly thought, if...
if I commit perjury, what if I go to jail?

26:34.092 --> 26:37.012
Who raises my kids then?
I mean, they could be, they could be faced

26:37.095 --> 26:39.180
with losing both their
father and their mother and...

26:41.474 --> 26:43.560
-plus, I...
-Plus what?

26:45.895 --> 26:47.814
I really believed
that the affair was over, Alan.

26:48.315 --> 26:50.191
I did. But it wasn't.

26:51.693 --> 26:54.571
Now how am I supposed to lie for somebody
who's not even faithful to me?

26:59.034 --> 27:00.535
(jail alarm blaring)

27:03.413 --> 27:04.873
-(keys jingling)
-(cell door clanks)

27:10.503 --> 27:12.589
So, Bob, we need to talk.

27:28.938 --> 27:31.441
-You okay?
-I'm fine.

27:33.151 --> 27:33.985
You want me to take this?

27:36.363 --> 27:37.280
I'll take it.

28:17.070 --> 28:20.031
First of all, I admire your honesty.

28:21.157 --> 28:24.119
To give testimony
against somebody you love.

28:27.414 --> 28:30.542
We all witnessed an extraordinary thing.

28:32.001 --> 28:35.672
Of course,
you didn't have to give that testimony.

28:36.631 --> 28:38.842
While it's true you were under oath,

28:38.925 --> 28:42.721
you also enjoy a privilege
as the defendant's spouse

28:42.804 --> 28:45.807
to not give evidence against him.

28:46.558 --> 28:50.061
Well, as I said, I didn't plan to,
but... once I took the stand,

28:50.145 --> 28:54.149
I felt that I'd effectively
waived that privilege, so...

28:54.232 --> 28:58.445
Ah. I guess the other conclusion would be

28:58.528 --> 29:03.241
that perhaps you really did
want to testify against him.

29:04.993 --> 29:08.329
-Did you?
-You know I didn't.

29:10.915 --> 29:16.004
Mrs. Prentice, have you undergone
any psychiatric treatment of late

29:16.087 --> 29:17.380
for a personality disorder?

29:20.550 --> 29:25.221
I've never been diagnosed...
with any personality disorder.

29:25.638 --> 29:26.681
ALAN: That wasn't my question.

29:26.765 --> 29:29.476
I asked whether you've been
treated recently for one.

29:31.728 --> 29:33.605
My medical history is private.

29:35.356 --> 29:40.361
But I will repeat, that I've never been
diagnosed with a personality disorder.

29:41.154 --> 29:46.701
Ah. Would you consider yourself
to be a violent person, Mrs. Prentice?

29:46.951 --> 29:48.578
-No.
-Have you ever been violent?

29:48.912 --> 29:51.539
Well, I'm sure everyone's lost
his or her temper, but...

29:52.123 --> 29:53.291
Ever lost yours with a knife?

29:57.504 --> 29:58.505
Am I being too vague?

29:59.214 --> 30:03.593
Have you ever lost your temper with a
knife with your nine-year-old daughter?

30:05.845 --> 30:07.931
-No.
-No? Gee.

30:08.723 --> 30:11.184
For someone with such a strong obligation

30:11.559 --> 30:14.312
to tell the truth under oath,
that answer surprises me.

30:15.647 --> 30:17.899
Did you not threaten
your nine-year-old daughter

30:18.358 --> 30:22.987
with a knife after she spilled grape juice
on your new living room carpet?

30:23.279 --> 30:26.449
I snapped at her while I had a knife
in my hand.

30:26.533 --> 30:28.827
Wasn't it more like
you were watching television,

30:28.910 --> 30:32.038
she spilled the juice,
you flew into a rage,

30:32.121 --> 30:34.707
went into the kitchen,
returned with paper towels

30:34.791 --> 30:38.294
and the knife and threatened her?
Wasn't it more like that?

30:38.461 --> 30:41.422
I never threatened her with a knife.

30:43.091 --> 30:44.926
A few minutes ago in that witness room,

30:45.009 --> 30:48.304
you indicated to me that you
had now reached the conclusion

30:48.596 --> 30:51.307
that your husband had resumed
his affair with Miss Goulet.

30:51.641 --> 30:53.309
-Did you not?
-Yes.

30:53.393 --> 30:55.520
In truth,
you reached that conclusion a week

30:55.603 --> 30:58.231
before the murder
when Miss Goulet told you

30:58.314 --> 30:59.232
the affair was back on, right?

30:59.983 --> 31:01.401
This time, you picked up the knife

31:01.484 --> 31:03.653
-and threatened your husband.
-No.

31:03.736 --> 31:04.946
You told him you would kill him,
didn't you?

31:05.822 --> 31:07.115
-No.
-Then you said you'd think of something

31:07.198 --> 31:08.533
even better than killing him,

31:08.616 --> 31:10.785
-didn't you, Phoebe?
-No.

31:11.411 --> 31:14.122
ALAN: You testified that Robert took
a sleeping pill that night.

31:14.205 --> 31:17.250
Did he unknowingly take two
or three extra, maybe in his wine?

31:17.709 --> 31:18.751
That's ridiculous.

31:18.835 --> 31:21.921
You were driving the car that pulled
into Miss Goulet's driveway that night,

31:22.005 --> 31:24.424
and you gave her the injection
that killed her,

31:24.507 --> 31:27.218
knowing full well
the police would suspect him.

31:27.302 --> 31:29.053
-Your Honor, this is--
-Sit down, Mr. Betts.

31:29.137 --> 31:32.390
And you didn't just frame him
and bury him at trial.

31:32.473 --> 31:36.311
You added the indignity of having
an old boyfriend be part of the equation.

31:36.394 --> 31:37.645
One might find that to be a little sick.

31:38.229 --> 31:39.731
You know, he is the sick one.

31:41.608 --> 31:44.861
And he has concocted
this fantastic tale...

31:47.989 --> 31:49.073
to get away with murder.

31:53.745 --> 31:54.746
You don't look well, Phoebe.

31:57.332 --> 32:01.294
You're diabetic.
How do you get your insulin?

32:06.382 --> 32:09.302
-Injections.
-Pretty good with needles then.

32:26.444 --> 32:30.490
Spectacular performance.
But I must say, I'm not surprised.

32:30.823 --> 32:35.745
Mr. Shore is legendary
for his stunts and spellbinding maneuvers

32:35.828 --> 32:37.872
that no doubt dazzle his audiences, but--

32:37.956 --> 32:40.083
I object to my sex life being introduced--

32:40.166 --> 32:41.000
Mr. Shore.

32:42.752 --> 32:45.380
STEWART: You see? This is what he does.

32:45.880 --> 32:49.258
He distracts, he uses sleight of hand,
he manipulates.

32:49.342 --> 32:53.429
But all of these ploys...
they come from desperation.

32:55.098 --> 32:58.017
All the physical evidence
points to the doctor,

32:58.101 --> 32:59.811
and it took the expertise of a doctor

32:59.894 --> 33:02.230
to make it look like a heart attack,
didn't it?

33:03.231 --> 33:05.566
The doctor was romantically involved
with the victim.

33:05.733 --> 33:08.486
The doctor is the one
who threatened the victim.

33:09.237 --> 33:13.241
Mr. Shore had no choice
but to reach into his magic hat

33:13.324 --> 33:18.997
and grope for something that he could
pass off as reasonable doubt.

33:20.790 --> 33:26.170
Well, there's desperation
and there is... desperation.

33:29.924 --> 33:31.801
Let's all get real.

33:36.139 --> 33:38.266
I wouldn't even know where to begin
to get real.

33:39.434 --> 33:44.647
It's so hard to believe
that any of this could possibly be real.

33:46.315 --> 33:50.194
It's so implausible, so fantastic,
so utterly...

33:54.407 --> 33:55.241
Phoebe.

33:57.243 --> 34:03.124
(scoffs) Whether she suddenly chose
to bury her husband while on the stand,

34:03.207 --> 34:06.210
or whether it was part of
some master plot, I don't know.

34:06.294 --> 34:10.131
But she buried him.
There is no disputing that.

34:11.549 --> 34:15.928
This crime was executed
with Machiavellian efficiency

34:16.012 --> 34:19.474
by a woman who not only had
plenty of motive,

34:19.557 --> 34:22.185
but is also quite handy with needles.

34:22.852 --> 34:27.565
True, there was no forensic evidence
to prove she was at the scene,

34:27.648 --> 34:29.067
but you heard the detective.

34:29.150 --> 34:32.570
He said the house was,
"conspicuously meticulous."

34:32.653 --> 34:33.488
It had been cleaned up.

34:34.655 --> 34:38.076
Could Phoebe Prentice have known
about the drug succinylcholine?

34:38.159 --> 34:41.871
Why not? Her husband is a doctor.
Their house is full of medical books.

34:41.954 --> 34:45.458
There's all kinds of evidence against her,
but the truth is, it doesn't matter,

34:46.375 --> 34:49.337
because you saw all you needed to
in her testimony.

34:49.712 --> 34:52.590
You saw it in her eyes,
you heard it in her voice,

34:53.508 --> 34:54.675
and you know...

35:00.807 --> 35:01.641
She did it.

35:03.601 --> 35:06.938
Phoebe Prentice killed the woman
her husband was sleeping with

35:07.438 --> 35:11.317
and framed her cheating husband
in the process. Perfect crime.

35:15.822 --> 35:16.697
Almost.

35:20.743 --> 35:21.661
Almost.

35:47.645 --> 35:48.563
(door closes)

36:08.166 --> 36:09.750
Okay. (clears throat)

36:09.834 --> 36:13.421
Madam Foreperson,
the jury has reached a unanimous verdict?

36:13.504 --> 36:16.549
-We have, Your Honor.
-The defendant will please rise.

36:19.010 --> 36:19.844
What say you?

36:20.761 --> 36:23.139
"In the matter
of <i>The Commonwealth of Massachusetts</i>

36:23.222 --> 36:26.976
<i>v. Robert L. Brooks,</i> on the charge
of murder in the first degree,

36:27.268 --> 36:29.812
we find the defendant Robert Brooks...

36:31.022 --> 36:35.151
-not guilty."
-(people murmuring)

36:35.234 --> 36:39.864
-(overlapping dialog)
-(camera shutter clicks)

36:43.326 --> 36:47.079
(clamoring)

36:53.294 --> 36:56.839
My advice to you, Dr. Brooks,
if you have out-of-town relatives,

36:56.923 --> 37:00.051
the press here does not figure
to let up for a while.

37:00.968 --> 37:02.595
No doubt your wife has left town.

37:04.805 --> 37:07.725
Well, I, uh, I suppose a, uh,
a huge thank you would be in order.

37:08.351 --> 37:11.354
-(chuckles) I suppose.
-Thank you.

37:12.313 --> 37:14.941
Can't say that you were everything
Phoebe built you up to be,

37:15.024 --> 37:17.151
but, uh... you were close.

37:17.235 --> 37:19.612
Did you really not suspect that
she'd left the house that night?

37:21.072 --> 37:22.448
I never left the house, Alan.

37:34.543 --> 37:36.379
When you told me that
I was the whole defense

37:36.462 --> 37:38.047
and that I wasn't persuasive,

37:38.130 --> 37:40.758
I... decided on another tack.

37:41.842 --> 37:47.640
Incriminating my husband in a way
that would make me seem guilty.

37:50.393 --> 37:55.314
Do you really think that I would threaten
my own child with a knife? Come on.

37:56.649 --> 38:00.236
We had to make up a few things,
give you something to get her with.

38:01.112 --> 38:04.615
I never got the call from the victim
telling me about the affair,

38:04.699 --> 38:10.663
I never told Robert I was gonna kill him,
and... I never left the house that night.

38:14.208 --> 38:15.334
You were very convincing.

38:17.169 --> 38:18.170
You might have been too convincing.

38:18.254 --> 38:20.881
You're now almost certain
to be arrested and charged with the crime.

38:20.965 --> 38:21.799
I can risk that

38:22.633 --> 38:25.344
since there's no evidence of me
committing it because I didn't.

38:26.887 --> 38:30.349
And if need be,
Robert can always set the record straight.

38:31.183 --> 38:33.894
He's protected now by double jeopardy,
so...

38:36.897 --> 38:38.524
-There's still perjury.
-Who committed perjury?

38:39.442 --> 38:41.110
He never testified, and I never lied.

38:41.527 --> 38:44.488
You'll remember that I denied
all of your accusations.

38:44.780 --> 38:50.119
In fact, the only one who tried
to introduce false evidence was... you.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.377
It was never my intent to play
it this way.

38:58.461 --> 39:02.256
I... my plan was simply to be his alibi,

39:02.340 --> 39:05.176
but then when you said
that I wasn't persuasive...

39:09.055 --> 39:12.600
-I'm sorry.
-You should leave now.

39:15.770 --> 39:18.731
-The truth is, I never deceived you.
-You told me he was innocent.

39:18.814 --> 39:20.316
But you weren't deceived, were you?

39:23.736 --> 39:25.112
Two other things I told you...

39:26.947 --> 39:31.077
keeping my family together
whatever the cost was everything to me.

39:33.871 --> 39:37.416
And that at the end, I would be...
walking away with Robert.

39:40.336 --> 39:41.629
I was very clear on that.

39:42.088 --> 39:48.260
(melancholic music playing)

40:08.989 --> 40:13.661
(melancholic music continues)

40:25.798 --> 40:27.383
There's gotta be a way to turn them in.

40:28.342 --> 40:33.180
We could. Get disbarred, go fishing.

40:34.223 --> 40:36.016
Retire to stud. (laughs)

40:36.892 --> 40:41.397
You know, Alan, you gotta tip your hat.
She fooled everybody, including us.

40:41.480 --> 40:43.941
I am not... tipping my hat.

40:48.737 --> 40:51.449
This is one of those times
I'm lucky to be unlucky in love.

40:52.199 --> 40:56.620
I'll bet you're lucky at cards.
Let's go to Vegas.

40:58.956 --> 41:00.249
I'm trying to cheer you up.

41:02.334 --> 41:03.461
Alan... (clicks tongue)

41:05.212 --> 41:07.339
The thing you have to realize,
and someday you will,

41:07.923 --> 41:11.427
a person only has one true love
in his life.

41:12.678 --> 41:14.305
Like it or not, your true love...

41:16.182 --> 41:17.016
is me.

41:18.476 --> 41:22.480
We may not have sex,
but ours is an affair of the heart.

41:24.899 --> 41:25.900
And we do spoon well.

41:28.360 --> 41:29.320
And I make you smile.

41:31.739 --> 41:33.991
-Yes, you do.
-(laughs)

41:37.995 --> 41:41.373
-Sleepover?
-(monitor buzzing)

41:41.457 --> 41:42.833
-Oh, forget it.
-What?

41:42.917 --> 41:44.084
Just forget it.

41:49.089 --> 41:50.758
I knew he did it all along, you know?

41:51.133 --> 41:52.718
-Did you, now?
-And she was playing you.

41:53.219 --> 41:56.222
-Why didn't you tell me?
-You had to discover it for yourself.

41:57.515 --> 42:00.518
-Like Dorothy and the ruby slippers.
-Exactly.

42:02.269 --> 42:05.648
I had a dream once I did Dorothy.
And the Lullaby League girls.

42:07.149 --> 42:08.484
Do you think they're of age?

42:11.070 --> 42:14.198
-I wouldn't know.
-Dwarfs love group sex, you know?

42:15.074 --> 42:16.283
I'm not listening.

42:17.076 --> 42:20.246
-I should give Bethany a call.
-(monitor buzzing)

42:20.329 --> 42:23.123
<i>We represent the Lullaby League</i>

42:23.207 --> 42:24.041
(buzzing continues)

42:24.124 --> 42:26.877
<i>The Lullaby League, the Lullaby League</i>

42:26.961 --> 42:30.923
<i>And in the name of the Lullaby League</i>

42:31.090 --> 42:35.844
<i>We wish to welcome you to Munchkinland</i>

42:38.514 --> 42:39.598
NARRATOR: <i>Next on</i> Boston Legal...

42:39.682 --> 42:41.350
-It's one you can't win, Alan.
-Says who?

42:41.433 --> 42:46.105
Says law. Says the United States
Supreme Court. Says $50,000.

42:46.188 --> 42:48.023
I've been informed
