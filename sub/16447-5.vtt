<i>Previously on</i>
The Big Bang Theory...

00:02.186 --> 00:04.332
Cohabitation with my girlfriend?

00:04.333 --> 00:06.224
That's a great deal
to process.

00:06.248 --> 00:06.768
Hmm?

00:06.769 --> 00:08.369
It's only for five weeks.

00:08.371 --> 00:09.670
Let me appeal
to the scientist in you.

00:09.672 --> 00:11.705
Given the five-week
end date,

00:11.707 --> 00:14.675
isn't it the perfect opportunity
to consider this an experiment

00:14.677 --> 00:16.744
and collect data
on our compatibility?

00:16.746 --> 00:19.847
Don't try luring me
in with sexy talk.

00:19.849 --> 00:21.515
LEONARD:
Okay.

00:21.517 --> 00:22.983
<i>Star Trek: The Original Series.</i>

00:22.985 --> 00:24.852
The <i>Enterprise</i> was
on a five-year mission

00:24.854 --> 00:25.986
to explore new worlds.

00:25.988 --> 00:27.187
Think of this
as your personal

00:27.189 --> 00:29.590
five-week mission
to do the same.

00:29.592 --> 00:34.061
Oh, you want to lure me in with
sexy talk, that's how you do it.

00:34.063 --> 00:35.696
Okay, why don't you guys
stay across the hall

00:35.698 --> 00:37.431
and we will
live here?

00:37.433 --> 00:38.866
(exhales)

00:38.868 --> 00:40.567
Very well. I'm on board.

00:40.569 --> 00:42.102
- Seriously?
- Yes.

00:42.104 --> 00:43.637
I accept this
five-week mission

00:43.639 --> 00:45.472
to share a living space
with my girlfriend.

00:45.474 --> 00:46.974
Oh. This is so exciting.

00:46.976 --> 00:49.009
Well, now, don't be surprised
if, like <i>Star Trek,</i>

00:49.011 --> 00:52.346
it's canceled in three.

00:53.849 --> 00:56.317
(dramatic music playing)
Okay, I'm confused.

00:56.319 --> 00:57.785
Which one is Mr. Robot?

00:57.787 --> 00:59.219
I'll give you a hint.

00:59.221 --> 01:01.722
We're watching
<i>Daredevil.</i>

01:01.724 --> 01:05.224
Will you two please inform Amy
how much you enjoy

01:05.227 --> 01:07.561
adhering
to a strict bathroom schedule?

01:07.563 --> 01:08.595
- Can't.
- Won't.

01:08.597 --> 01:09.830
- Didn't.
- Don't.

01:09.832 --> 01:11.098
AMY:
I told you,

01:11.100 --> 01:13.901
you can't regulate every aspect
of our lives.

01:13.903 --> 01:17.671
I can if you'd just roll over
and accept your fate.

01:17.673 --> 01:20.140
I'm sorry
for bringing this over here.

01:20.142 --> 01:21.842
Believe me, we know
what you're going through.

01:21.844 --> 01:24.445
And I-I think the most helpful
thing we can tell you is

01:24.447 --> 01:25.666
no backsies.

01:25.690 --> 01:27.482
Mm-hmm.

01:27.483 --> 01:28.816
Sheldon,
I understand

01:28.818 --> 01:30.250
that you like things
a certain way

01:30.252 --> 01:31.919
and I'm willing
to make some concessions,

01:31.921 --> 01:34.321
but you have to be open
to compromise.

01:34.323 --> 01:35.823
She's right.
That's reasonable.

01:35.825 --> 01:37.624
Oh, look who's in
favor of compromise,

01:37.626 --> 01:41.028
the woman who married
Leonard Hofstadter.

01:41.030 --> 01:43.263
Hey, she didn't
compromise.

01:43.265 --> 01:45.933
She settled.
There's a difference.

01:46.669 --> 01:49.203
Yeah. You tell him, babe.

What time do you
and Bernadette head out?

02:19.662 --> 02:21.195
As soon as I get home.

02:21.197 --> 02:22.630
We're hoping to make it
before dark.

02:22.632 --> 02:24.398
I've never been
to Palm Springs.

02:24.400 --> 02:25.733
Oh, you
should go.

02:25.735 --> 02:28.002
It's terrific.
I-I really thrive anywhere

02:28.004 --> 02:31.539
the women and the temperature
are over 90.

02:32.442 --> 02:33.808
I don't know.

02:33.810 --> 02:35.409
If I want to watch
old people sweat,

02:35.411 --> 02:38.612
I can just FaceTime
my family in India.

02:39.582 --> 02:40.581
It's nice you

02:40.583 --> 02:42.516
and Bernadette are getting away.

02:42.518 --> 02:45.152
Well, she wants us to
spend more time together

02:45.154 --> 02:46.520
before the baby comes.

02:46.522 --> 02:48.923
So then what are you doing here
buying comic books?

02:48.925 --> 02:51.392
Well, he wants us to
spend more time together

02:51.394 --> 02:53.461
before the baby comes.

02:55.631 --> 02:57.932
When you live with someone,
there's gonna be conflict.

02:57.934 --> 03:00.768
You just have
to keep communicating.

03:00.770 --> 03:02.369
I'm open to that.

03:02.371 --> 03:04.872
Okay. Well, for starters,

03:04.874 --> 03:07.408
there's nothing wrong
with keeping our toothbrushes

03:07.410 --> 03:09.109
in the same holder.

03:09.946 --> 03:12.513
Sheldon, what do you say
to that?

03:12.515 --> 03:14.482
I think we should
see other people.

03:17.353 --> 03:18.284
What?!

03:18.285 --> 03:21.423
Well, as a male, I have
an evolutionary drive

03:21.424 --> 03:23.190
to perpetuate my DNA.

03:23.192 --> 03:26.927
Restricting myself to a single
partner is against my nature.

03:28.598 --> 03:30.297
We sleep together once a year!

03:30.299 --> 03:32.833
You want other partners?

03:32.835 --> 03:35.769
Don't blame me.
Blame your pal, biology.

03:35.771 --> 03:38.305
He's the pervert pulling
the strings here.

03:39.308 --> 03:41.853
You wanna see other people?
Go see other people.

03:41.854 --> 03:42.290
(arguing indistinctly)

03:42.291 --> 03:45.613
I hope one of those people is a
monkey, 'cause this is bananas.

03:46.892 --> 03:48.556
You can make jokes,
but if this keeps up,

03:48.557 --> 03:49.763
he's gonna move
back in here.

03:49.787 --> 03:51.552
 All right. Well, let's just get them
apart for a while

03:51.554 --> 03:52.566
so they can cool down.

03:52.590 --> 03:53.455
Good.

03:53.456 --> 03:55.022
Then before we
reintroduce them,

03:55.024 --> 03:56.223
we'll give him one
of her sweaters

03:56.225 --> 03:58.726
so he can get used
to her scent again.

03:59.721 --> 04:02.329
So it's okay for you
to joke around?

04:02.331 --> 04:03.931
No, that's actually
what we did with him

04:03.933 --> 04:06.066
when Howard came
back from space.

04:08.271 --> 04:10.604
Honey, how ya feeling?

04:10.606 --> 04:12.806
(Bernadette retching loudly)

04:14.677 --> 04:16.744
The book says at this stage
of the pregnancy

04:16.745 --> 04:19.079
morning sickness
should be going away.

04:19.081 --> 04:21.248
(retching)

04:23.052 --> 04:26.020
So that's good news, right?

04:26.022 --> 04:29.757
The only thing I hate more than
you right now is that book!

04:29.759 --> 04:31.892
(toilet flushes)

04:33.829 --> 04:37.064
There she is!
(chuckles)

04:37.066 --> 04:39.967
Who's ready for a hot,

04:39.969 --> 04:43.404
three-hour car ride
to the desert?

04:43.406 --> 04:46.907
Next vomit is gonna be
in your lap.

04:46.909 --> 04:49.577
I'm sorry.

04:49.579 --> 04:51.545
We don't have to go.

04:51.547 --> 04:53.747
But it's our last chance
to take a vacation

04:53.749 --> 04:56.016
that's just the two of us.

04:56.018 --> 04:58.185
How 'bout we stay here?

04:58.187 --> 04:59.887
We don't even have
to tell anyone.

04:59.889 --> 05:02.923
It'll be like
a secret vacation at home.

05:02.925 --> 05:04.278
(chuckles)

05:04.302 --> 05:05.427
Keeping secrets
from our friends--

05:05.428 --> 05:07.528
that does sound
kinda fun.

05:07.530 --> 05:10.831
Does it sound... sexy?

05:15.638 --> 05:19.073
You just heard me
throwing up.

05:19.075 --> 05:22.409
You bet I did.

05:27.750 --> 05:31.051
You're so weird.

05:31.053 --> 05:33.087
You know what's weird?

05:37.393 --> 05:39.893
How turned on
you are right now.

05:42.698 --> 05:44.431
You know, people are quick
to accuse me

05:44.433 --> 05:45.833
of being difficult
to live with,

05:45.835 --> 05:48.535
but the truth is,
Amy is just as challenging.

05:48.537 --> 05:50.938
Just as challenging.

05:50.940 --> 05:52.106
Yes.

05:52.108 --> 05:54.908
As you.

05:54.910 --> 05:56.276
Yes.

05:56.278 --> 05:59.079
Just as challenging as you.

06:01.183 --> 06:02.449
When we're sleeping,

06:02.451 --> 06:03.884
she breathes on me.

06:03.886 --> 06:06.220
One night, it got so bad
I almost grabbed Toto

06:06.222 --> 06:08.656
and headed for the storm cellar.

06:08.658 --> 06:10.658
Leonard breathes on me, too.

06:10.660 --> 06:12.226
It's not a big deal.

06:12.228 --> 06:14.061
She's always complaining
about people at work.

06:14.063 --> 06:15.729
Well, so does Leonard.

06:15.731 --> 06:17.564
It's kind of annoying, but
it's not the end of the world.

06:17.566 --> 06:19.333
Do you know that when I get out
of the shower,

06:19.335 --> 06:22.936
she eyes me up and down
like I'm a piece of meat?

06:22.938 --> 06:24.171
You know, so does Leonard.

06:24.173 --> 06:25.472
Can't I just get ready
in the morning

06:25.474 --> 06:27.341
without him giving me
his goofy thumbs-up?

06:27.343 --> 06:28.742
"Hey."
(chuckles)

06:29.612 --> 06:31.445
I know.

06:31.447 --> 06:33.547
Sometimes I would just like
to be appreciated for my mind.

06:33.549 --> 06:36.950
Agreed!
Thank you!

06:39.388 --> 06:41.855
That feels great.

06:41.857 --> 06:43.190
Well,

06:43.192 --> 06:44.758
pulling a quarter out
of your ear

06:44.760 --> 06:47.695
isn't the only magic
these hands can do.

06:47.697 --> 06:51.231
In fact, wh-what's this

06:51.233 --> 06:54.468
between your toes?!

06:54.470 --> 06:58.338
Can you please stop making money
come out of me for two minutes?

07:01.744 --> 07:03.143
(door opens)

07:03.145 --> 07:04.445
(door shuts)

07:04.447 --> 07:05.746
(quietly):
Was that the front door?

07:05.748 --> 07:07.748
(quietly):
It sounded like it.

07:07.750 --> 07:10.451
(footsteps) Oh, my God.
Someone's in the house.

07:10.453 --> 07:12.653
Lock the door, lock the door!

07:14.123 --> 07:16.356
- We should call the police.
- Uh...

07:16.358 --> 07:18.125
I left my phone downstairs.

07:18.127 --> 07:19.660
Damn, so did I.

07:19.662 --> 07:21.528
Wait, I have my iPad!
What are we gonna do,

07:21.530 --> 07:23.797
e-mail 911?

07:23.799 --> 07:25.466
That's not helpful!

07:25.468 --> 07:26.467
You know I rely

07:26.469 --> 07:28.335
on humor in times of stress.

07:28.337 --> 07:30.904
Let me know when you start,
because that wasn't funny!

07:31.440 --> 07:33.807
(whirring)

07:33.809 --> 07:34.942
(bubbling)

07:34.944 --> 07:36.844
Is that the hot tub?

07:37.680 --> 07:40.180
Who would use
our hot tub?

07:40.182 --> 07:41.448
(sighs)

07:41.450 --> 07:44.585
Well, the answer is both
more and less disturbing

07:44.587 --> 07:46.353
than you think.

07:46.355 --> 07:47.454
Who is it?

07:47.456 --> 07:48.622
Stuart.

07:51.694 --> 07:54.428
He heard me talking
about us going away.

07:54.430 --> 07:57.965
I guess he decided
to invite himself over?

07:57.967 --> 07:59.833
Should we say something to him?

07:59.835 --> 08:01.935
Maybe. How 'bout,

08:01.937 --> 08:06.473
"Hey, you look like
a boiled chicken breast"?

08:07.743 --> 08:10.144
I meant like, "What
are you doing here?"

08:10.146 --> 08:13.514
Nah, that's not gonna
hurt his feelings.

08:14.683 --> 08:17.017
Why is nothing easy
with him?

08:17.019 --> 08:21.288
Look, here's the thing you need
to understand about Sheldon:

08:21.290 --> 08:23.757
he's the worst.

08:23.759 --> 08:26.994
I prefer to think of it
as high-maintenance.

08:26.996 --> 08:28.929
I prefer to think of myself
as five-ten,

08:28.931 --> 08:31.198
but I still need to get
all my pants hemmed.

08:31.200 --> 08:34.902
I guess I should have known
what I was getting myself into.

08:34.904 --> 08:36.370
Don't beat yourself up.

08:36.371 --> 08:38.371
You've never lived
with anyone before.

08:38.374 --> 08:40.374
That's true.
And you're starting out

08:40.376 --> 08:42.376
with Sheldon Cooper.

08:42.378 --> 08:45.045
That's like getting your first
pet and having it be--

08:45.047 --> 08:47.047
I don't know...

08:47.049 --> 08:50.317
What's a kind of pet
that ruins your life?

08:50.319 --> 08:52.853
You're not making me
feel better.

08:52.855 --> 08:55.622
Look, even when Penny and I
started living together,

08:55.624 --> 08:57.357
there was a-a learning curve.

08:57.359 --> 08:59.993
But I promise you,
it does get easier.

08:59.995 --> 09:01.929
He put a sign up in the bathroom
that says,

09:01.931 --> 09:05.899
"Number of days
without Amy's hair on the soap."

09:06.735 --> 09:08.268
Yeah.

09:08.270 --> 09:11.305
My record was six.

09:13.475 --> 09:15.475
Is it me,
or is there something fun

09:15.477 --> 09:17.711
about watching him
just float there?

09:20.549 --> 09:23.183
Maybe this is why
people get fish tanks.

09:23.185 --> 09:25.285
(click)

09:25.287 --> 09:27.087
Who just turned
the porch lights on?

09:27.089 --> 09:29.256
Is someone else here?

09:32.061 --> 09:34.628
Hmm. They must have left
the tub on.

09:34.630 --> 09:36.463
Good thing I stopped by.

09:38.000 --> 09:44.074

09:50.913 --> 09:53.580

(screaming)

09:57.720 --> 10:00.320
(screaming)

10:08.155 --> 10:10.456
What are you doing here?!

10:11.166 --> 10:13.299
What are <i>you</i> doing here?!

10:13.944 --> 10:17.312
Maybe Howard and Bernadette said
I could be here!

10:17.314 --> 10:19.248
Did they?

10:19.250 --> 10:21.950
Answer the question!
What are you doing here?!

10:23.053 --> 10:25.754
I had nothing else
to do tonight.

10:25.756 --> 10:27.256
The last couple of months,

10:27.258 --> 10:29.625
I come here when I
know they're not home.

10:29.627 --> 10:30.659
What?!

10:30.661 --> 10:32.194
They heard me in
the bushes once,

10:32.196 --> 10:34.430
but they thought
it was a raccoon.

10:35.733 --> 10:38.233
I told you raccoons
don't say "Uh-oh."

10:41.005 --> 10:43.839
You know, one night, Leonard's
nose whistled so loud,

10:43.841 --> 10:47.009
I swear it was like
sleeping on a train track.

10:47.011 --> 10:48.800
Have you noticed
it's always an A-flat?

10:48.824 --> 10:50.313
Is it?

10:50.314 --> 10:51.947
(whistles)
Oh!

10:51.949 --> 10:54.349
It's like his sinuses
are right here in the car.

10:54.351 --> 10:57.519
If we're just going
to drive around aimlessly,

10:57.521 --> 10:59.755
the least you could do is
take me for ice cream.

10:59.757 --> 11:01.423
Yeah, I'll take you
for ice cream.

11:01.425 --> 11:04.059
Well, see, why can't Amy be
that subservient?

11:04.061 --> 11:07.896
She has coitus one time,
suddenly she's Gloria Steinem.

11:09.300 --> 11:11.600
Anyway, I suppose an ice cream
parlor will be a good place

11:11.602 --> 11:12.968
to meet other women.

11:12.970 --> 11:14.736
Oh, please, you're
barely interested

11:14.738 --> 11:16.405
in a physical relationship
with one person.

11:16.407 --> 11:20.275
Why would you want to confuse
and disappoint others?

11:20.277 --> 11:24.112
Being with Amy has awoken
the sexual creature within.

11:24.114 --> 11:27.449
When I see a pretty gal walking
down the street, I think,

11:27.451 --> 11:30.452
"hubba hubba"
like any other guy.

11:30.454 --> 11:33.555
You kiss your mother
with that mouth?

11:33.557 --> 11:34.823
'Cause it's fine.

11:37.328 --> 11:39.528
Here you go.

11:39.530 --> 11:41.730
Thank you.

11:43.067 --> 11:44.700
Shall we toast?

11:44.702 --> 11:47.169
To Howard and Bernadette,

11:47.171 --> 11:50.372
and the house key they
never asked me to return.

11:51.876 --> 11:53.909
You said you got it back.

11:53.911 --> 11:57.346
Well, clearly, I lied.

11:58.916 --> 12:00.282
So how's your apartment?

12:00.284 --> 12:02.284
Not great. The
electricity's out.

12:02.286 --> 12:03.952
So why don't you get it fixed?

12:03.954 --> 12:08.724
I called, and they're
like, "Pay your bill!"

12:08.726 --> 12:11.860
Of you ever need somewhere to
crash, there's always my place.

12:11.862 --> 12:14.029
Oh, no. I don't want
to be an inconvenience.

12:14.031 --> 12:16.965
You've got all your
lady friends, and...

12:16.967 --> 12:18.934
Actually, I'm single now.

12:18.936 --> 12:20.102
STUART:
What?!

12:20.104 --> 12:21.370
When did that happen?

12:21.372 --> 12:23.272
It's okay. It's by choice.

12:23.274 --> 12:26.542
Well, their choice,
and it's not okay.

12:26.544 --> 12:29.144
Oh. Sorry.
I didn't know.

12:29.146 --> 12:32.881
Nobody does. I was embarrassed
so I didn't say anything.

12:32.883 --> 12:34.783
Why wouldn't he tell us?

12:34.785 --> 12:36.785
Are we bad friends?

12:36.787 --> 12:39.187
He's in our hot tub
drinking our wine.

12:39.189 --> 12:41.857
Yeah, he deserves
to be alone.

12:43.227 --> 12:46.094
So you're back out
on the dating scene now?

12:46.096 --> 12:48.063
Yeah, yeah, a little.

12:48.065 --> 12:49.932
Oh, that must be fun.
How's that going?

12:49.934 --> 12:52.601
I'm in a hot tub with you,
so pretty bad.

12:55.606 --> 12:58.307
Maybe I should just give in
to his stupid bathroom schedule.

12:58.309 --> 12:59.942
No, don't do that.

12:59.944 --> 13:01.910
- But you did!
- Exactly!

13:01.912 --> 13:04.546
Learn from my mistakes!

13:04.548 --> 13:07.516
No matter where
I am at 7:18 a.m.,

13:07.518 --> 13:10.152
there better be
a toilet nearby.

13:12.756 --> 13:15.557
It's just so much easier
to give him what he wants.

13:15.559 --> 13:19.194
Oh, true, but think of how
much you've accomplished.

13:19.196 --> 13:21.763
Who got him to stop
Purelling his pocket change?

13:21.765 --> 13:23.765
Me.

13:23.767 --> 13:25.867
And who got him to put
things other than gloves

13:25.869 --> 13:27.603
in the glove compartment?

13:27.605 --> 13:29.538
Me.

13:29.540 --> 13:31.206
It was mittens.

13:31.208 --> 13:32.507
Mm.

13:32.509 --> 13:34.643
And who got him to
try a turkey dog?

13:34.645 --> 13:35.844
That was actually Koothrappali,

13:35.846 --> 13:38.480
but I did let him spit it out
in my hand.

13:38.482 --> 13:41.717
Look, how can you stop now?

13:41.719 --> 13:43.251
That's like walking
out of <i>Pinocchio</i>

13:43.253 --> 13:45.821
right before he
becomes a real boy.

13:45.823 --> 13:47.322
You know, you're right.

13:47.324 --> 13:48.924
I'm in this relationship, too.

13:48.926 --> 13:49.925
I need to stand up for myself.

13:49.926 --> 13:50.932
Of course you do.

13:50.933 --> 13:53.762
And if he doesn't like it,
he can move back here.

13:53.764 --> 13:57.766
Oh. He can try. He'd just
need a good locksmith.

14:00.537 --> 14:03.338
Well, who you
gonna hit on?

14:03.340 --> 14:05.307
The girl in front of
us got strawberry.

14:05.309 --> 14:07.342
That's your favorite.

14:07.344 --> 14:11.146
No. No, if we both like it,
I'll spend the rest of my life

14:11.148 --> 14:14.883
opening the freezer and going,
"Aw, no strawberry."

14:14.885 --> 14:17.686
What about the girl
behind the counter?

14:17.688 --> 14:20.088
Hmm? Well, she spends
her whole day scooping.

14:20.090 --> 14:23.959
One arm's probably
bigger than the other.

14:23.961 --> 14:27.396
Is it possible you might not
actually want to meet someone?

14:28.999 --> 14:31.533
You are truly wise.

14:31.535 --> 14:32.314
Thank you.

14:32.338 --> 14:33.636
I'd say

14:33.637 --> 14:34.659
wise beyond your years,
but you're getting up there.

14:34.683 --> 14:35.909
All right.

14:37.107 --> 14:40.542
Come on. What is really
going on with you?

14:42.413 --> 14:45.213
Penny, I am going
to tell you a story

14:45.215 --> 14:46.481
that I've never told anyone.

14:46.483 --> 14:48.050
All right.

14:48.052 --> 14:50.385
I was 13 years old,

14:50.387 --> 14:53.388
and on spring break
from college.

14:57.361 --> 14:59.327
Not relating. Go on.

14:59.329 --> 15:03.732
I came home early because they
ran out of math to teach me.

15:03.734 --> 15:05.767
Oh, now I'm with ya. Okay.

15:05.769 --> 15:07.669
My mother was at bible study.

15:07.671 --> 15:10.305
I walked in the house
expecting to find it empty,

15:10.307 --> 15:14.142
and I heard a sound coming
from my parents' bedroom.

15:14.144 --> 15:15.977
When I opened the door,

15:15.979 --> 15:19.548
I saw my father having relations
with another woman.

15:19.550 --> 15:22.651
Oh, that's awful!
I know.

15:22.653 --> 15:24.619
It's also why
I never open a door

15:24.621 --> 15:26.288
without knocking three times.

15:26.290 --> 15:28.223
I mean, the first
one's traditional,

15:28.225 --> 15:31.560
but two and three are for people
to get their pants on.

15:31.562 --> 15:34.896
Well, what happened
with your dad?

15:34.898 --> 15:37.999
We locked eyes,
I ran to my room,

15:38.001 --> 15:40.702
and we never, ever spoke of it.

15:40.704 --> 15:42.604
You poor thing.

15:42.606 --> 15:45.107
Since Amy and I
have been living together,

15:45.109 --> 15:47.642
we've been bickering
like my parents used to.

15:47.644 --> 15:51.012
And you're afraid you're gonna
do something like your dad did?

15:51.014 --> 15:53.648
Yes. I need to prepare her now

15:53.650 --> 15:55.576
to save her from pain
down the road.

15:55.600 --> 15:56.819
Down the road?

15:56.820 --> 15:59.588
Sheldon, she wanted to share a
toothbrush holder with you,

15:59.590 --> 16:03.258
and now you're at an ice cream
parlor trying to pick up women!

16:05.028 --> 16:07.996
Well, anything can sound silly
when you put it in that tone.

16:07.998 --> 16:10.031
Honey, instead of
worrying about pain

16:10.033 --> 16:12.134
you might cause in the
future, how about trying

16:12.136 --> 16:14.302
to fix the pain you're
causing her right now?

16:14.304 --> 16:16.071
(sighs)

16:16.073 --> 16:18.673
I'm sure you're right.

16:18.675 --> 16:21.610
I suppose I should
apologize to you, as well.

16:21.612 --> 16:23.245
Okay.

16:23.247 --> 16:26.214
That must have hurt watching me
look for other women

16:26.216 --> 16:29.117
without ever even
considering you.

16:33.423 --> 16:36.324
Please understand
that I think of you

16:36.326 --> 16:39.628
as more of a nanny.

16:39.630 --> 16:43.832
Just finish your ice cream
so I can get you home to bed.

16:48.906 --> 16:51.039
I wonder if this is
what it feels like

16:51.041 --> 16:53.542
to be Bernadette's baby.

16:55.179 --> 16:58.213
I don't know. Bernadette's baby
doesn't have a Jacuzzi jet

16:58.215 --> 17:00.482
hitting just the right spot.

17:02.452 --> 17:06.655
Those jets are
for <i>my</i> secret spot, not his!

17:06.656 --> 17:08.957
What do you do in there?!

17:08.959 --> 17:12.993
It's called relaxing,
and that's all you need to know.

17:15.432 --> 17:17.699
Well, it's getting late.

17:17.701 --> 17:19.968
Maybe we should head home.

17:19.970 --> 17:22.704
Yeah, you're probably right.

17:22.705 --> 17:24.172
(sighs)

17:24.174 --> 17:25.906
You coming?

17:25.909 --> 17:27.709
Yeah, just give me a minute.

17:27.711 --> 17:28.944
Why?

17:28.946 --> 17:32.581
Well, you know how
you're wearing a bathing suit?

17:32.583 --> 17:34.516
Yeah?

17:34.518 --> 17:37.586
I kind of went the other way.

17:38.755 --> 17:41.323
You jackasses just bought
yourselves a hot tub!

17:53.972 --> 17:55.705
What do you think?

17:55.707 --> 17:56.940
It's a nice enough spot.

17:56.942 --> 17:59.175
You know, if I'm going to start
standing up for myself,

17:59.177 --> 18:00.103
this is exactly
the kind of thing...

18:00.104 --> 18:00.875
We're back!

18:00.899 --> 18:02.521
Oh, hi! Hi!

18:04.683 --> 18:06.188
Hello.

18:06.189 --> 18:07.355
How you guys doing?

18:07.357 --> 18:08.523
We're doing good. I think

18:08.525 --> 18:10.325
Sheldon has something he
would like to say to Amy.

18:10.327 --> 18:12.493
(sighs)

18:14.965 --> 18:19.200
I wanted to apologize
for my behavior today. It...

18:23.139 --> 18:26.040
(clears his throat)

18:26.042 --> 18:29.544
It was unnecessary.

18:29.546 --> 18:32.847
This is warm.

18:34.484 --> 18:39.721
Oh, and also, I am willing to
forego the bathroom schedule.

18:39.723 --> 18:41.990
Oh. Really?

18:41.992 --> 18:44.192
Why does she get that?!
We never got that!

18:44.194 --> 18:45.893
Do you want him back?

18:45.895 --> 18:47.996
I'm very happy for you.

18:48.732 --> 18:51.499
Amy, you should know

18:51.501 --> 18:53.868
I was never really interested
in seeing other women.

18:53.870 --> 18:57.572
And to prove how
serious I am about us,

18:57.574 --> 19:01.309
I'm willing to take our
relationship to the next level.

19:02.612 --> 19:04.812
Amy Farrah Fowler,

19:04.814 --> 19:07.949
will you share
this toothbrush holder with me?

19:10.687 --> 19:12.854
I would love to.

19:17.060 --> 19:19.027
LEONARD:
Did we really

19:19.029 --> 19:21.729
need to be
here for this?

19:21.731 --> 19:24.899
Call me crazy,
but I found it moving.
