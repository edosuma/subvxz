WEBVTT

00:02.136 --> 00:03.871
Previously on Elementary...
Have you heard anything

00:03.904 --> 00:05.773
about my friend?
There have been no new leads

00:05.806 --> 00:07.075
in the disappearance
of Polly Kenner.

00:07.108 --> 00:09.177
There is nothing I can do
to get his attention.

00:09.210 --> 00:12.980
If I need to get louder,
I'll get louder.

00:13.013 --> 00:14.282
HOLMES:
A woman was murdered

00:14.315 --> 00:15.649
two nights ago in Brooklyn.

00:15.683 --> 00:18.586
The earrings that she
was wearing were Polly's.

00:18.619 --> 00:19.153
Do you have any idea who did it?

00:19.187 --> 00:20.421
Yeah, he did it.

00:20.454 --> 00:22.456
Not a doubt in my mind.

00:22.490 --> 00:24.492
WATSON: Your blood pressure
and heart rate are way up.

00:24.525 --> 00:25.626
You're not just
suffering from PCS.

00:25.659 --> 00:27.428
This is clinical fatigue now.

00:27.461 --> 00:28.996
So, I'm going to go away
for a while,

00:29.029 --> 00:30.264
but I'll be back.

00:30.298 --> 00:31.599
While I'm away,

00:31.632 --> 00:34.468
you have my word,
I won't hurt anyone.

00:34.502 --> 00:35.803
My car's here.

00:35.836 --> 00:37.638
Taking a break from everything
is smart.

00:37.671 --> 00:39.039
It's what your doctor wanted.

00:39.073 --> 00:41.342
You'll be back soon enough.
You'll be better.

00:55.055 --> 00:57.091
Watson!

00:57.125 --> 00:58.792
(footsteps approaching)

00:58.826 --> 01:00.594
I have returned.

01:00.628 --> 01:01.962
Am I crazy,
or did you say

01:01.995 --> 01:03.964
you were gonna come
back on Friday?

01:03.997 --> 01:07.168
I did... but some sore feelings
developed between me

01:07.201 --> 01:08.569
and the local constabulary.
Why would...?

01:11.705 --> 01:13.941
You got involved in a case,
didn't you?

01:13.974 --> 01:16.310
As you know, I spent the bulk
of the last three months

01:16.344 --> 01:17.678
in my cabin, cut off

01:17.711 --> 01:19.380
from the outside world.

01:19.413 --> 01:21.048
So, when word reached me
that renowned trapper

01:21.081 --> 01:23.384
Ragnar Hagerstrom had been
killed by a pack of black bears

01:23.417 --> 01:25.353
just miles from my
mountainside retreat...

01:25.386 --> 01:27.087
You weren't supposed
to do any work.

01:27.121 --> 01:28.256
I realize
that, but...

01:28.289 --> 01:29.923
No work. That was the deal.

01:29.957 --> 01:32.193
As I told you
when we last corresponded,

01:32.226 --> 01:34.061
I haven't experienced
a headache in over a month.

01:34.094 --> 01:35.563
My sleep patterns have
returned to normal.

01:35.596 --> 01:37.531
Well, my normal.

01:37.565 --> 01:39.400
I still have to follow up
with Dr. Hanson,

01:39.433 --> 01:40.934
but all indications are that

01:40.968 --> 01:42.670
my post-concussion syndrome
is in abatement.

01:42.703 --> 01:45.139
Now, would you
like to hear about

01:45.173 --> 01:47.308
one scorned woman's attempt
to frame an innocent black bear

01:47.341 --> 01:49.076
or... not?

01:49.109 --> 01:50.511
And why do you keep
looking over there?

01:53.747 --> 01:55.383
I have a houseguest.

01:57.084 --> 01:59.587
You've taken a lover
in my absence. That's excellent.

01:59.620 --> 02:01.121
I can't wait to
meet him. Or her.

02:01.155 --> 02:02.890
Or is it them?

02:02.923 --> 02:05.559
No, I have not
taken a lover.

02:05.593 --> 02:06.860
So, why are you so determined

02:06.894 --> 02:08.061
to stop me
from going downstairs?

02:08.095 --> 02:09.963
WOMAN: Hey, Joan,
I hope you don't mind,

02:09.997 --> 02:13.467
but I'm starving, so I
dug through your fridge.

02:14.468 --> 02:16.504
Hi. I'm Kelsey.

02:17.905 --> 02:19.573
Kelsey, this is Sherlock,
my partner.

02:19.607 --> 02:21.575
Oh. I don't
recall seeing

02:21.609 --> 02:23.577
his name in
the paperwork.
What paperwork?

02:23.611 --> 02:25.979
He is not my partner partner.

02:26.013 --> 02:29.217
He is my business partner.
What paperwork?

02:29.250 --> 02:32.453
The application she filled
out to adopt my baby.

02:32.486 --> 02:34.455
No... Kelsey just got in
about 20 minutes before you did,

02:34.488 --> 02:36.590
so why don't I
take you upstairs,

02:36.624 --> 02:37.958
and then you can
get settled.

02:37.991 --> 02:39.293
We'll talk.

02:52.906 --> 02:54.875
How's it going, Professor?

02:56.277 --> 02:59.813
How long are you gonna
keep calling me that?

02:59.847 --> 03:02.316
Haven't decided yet...
Professor.

03:03.784 --> 03:05.286
Can I at least take
off the dunce cap?

03:05.319 --> 03:07.120
Hey, who signed off
on this concrete

03:07.154 --> 03:08.489
being poured
the other night?

03:10.057 --> 03:11.559
I did.

03:11.592 --> 03:13.227
And who forgot to ask me
if we'd finished

03:13.261 --> 03:14.228
putting in all the piping?

03:14.262 --> 03:15.629
Me.

03:15.663 --> 03:18.532
Then no, you can't
take off the cap.

03:25.573 --> 03:27.741
Are you gonna watch me
pull up every slab?

03:27.775 --> 03:29.843
Just the first.
Making sure you still know

03:29.877 --> 03:31.379
how to operate a chain hoist.

03:41.322 --> 03:43.190
Happy?

03:43.223 --> 03:44.958
What did I do now?

03:45.993 --> 03:47.428
What is that?

03:47.461 --> 03:48.996
That's a person, Fred.

03:49.029 --> 03:50.464
Two arms with...

03:50.498 --> 03:52.533
guts in the middle.

03:52.566 --> 03:54.134
And those are the legs.

03:54.167 --> 03:55.836
Somebody got buried here.

03:55.869 --> 03:58.639
And you just cut 'em
into pieces.

03:58.672 --> 04:00.541
*

04:11.985 --> 04:14.087
HOLMES: I'd ask for an
update on the search

04:14.121 --> 04:15.356
for Michael Rowan, but your
data speaks for itself.

04:15.389 --> 04:17.491
No activity on his credit
cards or cell phone.

04:17.524 --> 04:18.759
Since we spoke last weekend,

04:18.791 --> 04:20.894
his e-mail account
remains a ghost town.

04:20.928 --> 04:22.396
I take it our friends
at the Bureau

04:22.430 --> 04:23.797
are still sending you
missing persons alerts.

04:23.831 --> 04:25.132
Yeah, every day someone
goes missing,

04:25.165 --> 04:26.734
I get a notice on my phone.

04:26.767 --> 04:28.502
I thought we were
onto something when a woman

04:28.536 --> 04:29.803
who looked a little
like Maddie Williams

04:29.837 --> 04:31.071
disappeared in Fresno
the other day.

04:31.104 --> 04:32.340
I almost called you,
but then she

04:32.373 --> 04:33.974
turned up safe and sound
a couple hours later.

04:34.007 --> 04:35.876
Would appear that Michael
has gone dormant.

04:35.909 --> 04:37.678
That's one possibility.

04:37.711 --> 04:39.547
Another is that he's gotten
so good at killing

04:39.580 --> 04:40.881
that no one in law enforcement

04:40.914 --> 04:42.650
even notices anymore.

04:42.683 --> 04:44.585
As we discussed before I took
my leave of absence,

04:44.618 --> 04:47.421
he seemed to mean it when he
said he would restrain himself.

04:47.455 --> 04:49.390
He also said he'd be back, so...

04:49.423 --> 04:51.425
we have to believe
he meant that, too.
Thank you.

04:51.459 --> 04:52.793
For tending to this
while I was gone.

04:52.826 --> 04:54.362
Couldn't have taken
the time I needed

04:54.395 --> 04:56.263
without knowing that you
were still at the helm.

04:57.665 --> 04:59.099
I wasn't the only one
looking for Michael.

04:59.132 --> 05:01.435
You're the only one
who mattered.

05:02.536 --> 05:04.638
Is there a corresponding
wall of evidence

05:04.672 --> 05:06.574
which traces your search
for a baby?

05:06.607 --> 05:08.676
(sighs)
I'm sorry about that.

05:08.709 --> 05:10.511
I did not mean to spring
Kelsey on you.

05:10.544 --> 05:13.180
My attorney didn't even
tell me about it till yesterday.

05:13.213 --> 05:14.582
Your attorney?

05:14.615 --> 05:16.717
Yeah, I hired him a few weeks
before you left.

05:16.750 --> 05:18.586
Listen, I was gonna talk
to you about it,

05:18.619 --> 05:20.721
but you were going through
so much with your PCS, and I...

05:20.754 --> 05:22.222
Watson, you don't owe me
an explanation.

05:22.255 --> 05:24.758
She's going to be here
for a few more days only, okay?

05:24.792 --> 05:26.694
Then she goes back to school
in Philadelphia.

05:26.727 --> 05:28.496
She's here to meet with me
and a couple of other

05:28.529 --> 05:30.664
prospective parents
before she goes back.
(cell phone chiming)

05:30.698 --> 05:32.533
It's Marcus.

05:33.567 --> 05:35.035
I know you just got back,
but how

05:35.068 --> 05:36.637
do you feel
about a trip to the morgue?

05:36.670 --> 05:38.506
Mmm.

05:38.539 --> 05:41.041
HAWES:
Meet Jane Doe.

05:41.074 --> 05:43.310
Construction crew found her
in a concrete floor

05:43.343 --> 05:45.513
they were cutting
into pieces this morning.

05:45.546 --> 05:47.648
As I noted,
the saw they were using

05:47.681 --> 05:50.183
cut her just below
the shoulders

05:50.217 --> 05:51.452
and right above
the knees.

05:51.485 --> 05:52.786
No concrete in her
throat or lungs,

05:52.820 --> 05:54.522
so she was dead
before she went into the cement.

05:54.555 --> 05:57.224
These ligature marks-- cause
of death strangulation?

05:57.257 --> 05:59.893
Yeah. As confirmed
by a fractured larynx.

05:59.927 --> 06:01.395
Time of death's
between 6:00 p.m.

06:01.429 --> 06:02.863
and midnight
two nights ago.

06:02.896 --> 06:04.598
Makes sense.
The floor she was in

06:04.632 --> 06:06.166
was poured two nights ago.

06:06.199 --> 06:08.135
Any security cameras
at the work site?

06:08.168 --> 06:09.703
BELL:
No.

06:09.737 --> 06:11.772
And it's a small crew--
eight guys total.

06:11.805 --> 06:13.741
Alibis for the first six
have already checked out,

06:13.774 --> 06:16.977
and I'm expecting the remaining
two to go the same way.

06:17.010 --> 06:19.580
Says here that you found
a nylon fiber in her teeth.

06:19.613 --> 06:20.748
God bless man-made fibers

06:20.781 --> 06:22.049
and the manufacturers
who register them.

06:22.082 --> 06:24.251
The lab says that the fiber

06:24.284 --> 06:27.187
came from the seat belt
of a late-model Japanese sedan.

06:27.220 --> 06:29.256
Unfortunately,
the seat belt is used

06:29.289 --> 06:30.691
in cars made
by multiple companies.

06:30.724 --> 06:32.593
Stands to reason
it was the murder weapon.

06:32.626 --> 06:33.994
These ligature marks
are approximately

06:34.027 --> 06:35.095
48 millimeters across.

06:35.128 --> 06:36.797
That is standard width
for a seat belt.

06:37.565 --> 06:39.099
Personal effects?

06:39.132 --> 06:40.400
Help yourself.

06:40.434 --> 06:41.635
I checked with
Missing Persons.

06:41.669 --> 06:44.572
She doesn't match
any reports.

06:44.605 --> 06:46.707
No hits on her
fingerprints, either.

06:46.740 --> 06:49.477
Who needs fingerprints
when you got one of these?

06:49.510 --> 06:51.344
What, a rubber
bracelet?

06:51.378 --> 06:53.714
It's a smart rubber bracelet.

06:53.747 --> 06:54.848
Do you have a scalpel?

06:54.882 --> 06:56.416
Oh.

06:58.486 --> 07:00.521
Thank you.

07:00.554 --> 07:04.124
Companies with restricted areas
sometimes use

07:04.157 --> 07:07.260
RF chips embedded
in bracelets instead of

07:07.294 --> 07:09.597
the traditional
plastic access cards.

07:09.630 --> 07:11.164
So...

07:11.198 --> 07:14.167
This should help us identify
her employers,

07:14.201 --> 07:15.603
and that, in turn,

07:15.636 --> 07:17.938
should help us identify her.

07:17.971 --> 07:19.573
MAN:
Oh, my God.

07:19.607 --> 07:20.974
Poor Lauren.

07:21.008 --> 07:22.810
You said somebody killed her?

07:22.843 --> 07:24.177
Strangled her.

07:24.211 --> 07:26.146
She didn't have
any I.D. on her,

07:26.179 --> 07:28.015
but the RF chip in her bracelet

07:28.048 --> 07:31.218
told us she worked
here at Pathas Global.

07:31.251 --> 07:32.553
Or at least she did until you

07:32.586 --> 07:34.121
suspended her
without pay last week.

07:34.154 --> 07:37.758
She was very talented,
but she and Pathas

07:37.791 --> 07:39.259
were proving not
to be a good fit.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.595
That said, I'm sure HR still
has all her information.

07:41.629 --> 07:43.564
I'll ask somebody
to bring it up.

07:43.597 --> 07:45.132
Actually, we've already
been to HR.

07:45.165 --> 07:46.634
Got everything we need.

07:46.667 --> 07:48.936
Well, I'm confused.

07:48.969 --> 07:50.838
Why did you need
to speak with me?

07:50.871 --> 07:52.706
You said Lauren Wexler
and Pathas weren't a good fit.

07:52.740 --> 07:53.707
But...

07:53.741 --> 07:54.942
you are Pathas, Mr. Salinger.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.209
It says so right there.

07:59.613 --> 08:02.550
Oh, you think I had something
to do with this?

08:02.583 --> 08:03.917
Listen, I
suspended Lauren.

08:03.951 --> 08:05.853
Why would I also kill her?

08:05.886 --> 08:08.221
Why would you call her
an "incompetent bitch"

08:08.255 --> 08:10.057
on a convention floor
last month?

08:10.090 --> 08:11.692
Oh... I wouldn't have taken you

08:11.725 --> 08:13.627
for a fan of tech industry
gossip sites.

08:13.661 --> 08:16.630
You were overheard saying
that you would end her.

08:16.664 --> 08:18.265
Now she's dead.

08:18.298 --> 08:20.634
If you thought the gossip sites
were hard on you before...

08:20.668 --> 08:23.203
I wasn't talking
about ending her.

08:23.236 --> 08:25.005
Okay, I was talking

08:25.038 --> 08:27.040
about ending her work on MERMA.

08:27.074 --> 08:29.042
What's MERMA?

08:29.076 --> 08:31.912
SALINGER:
MERMA is an acronym.

08:31.945 --> 08:35.282
Marine Ecosystem Renewal
and Maintenance Apparatus.

08:35.315 --> 08:38.217
This thing glides across
the surface of a body of water,

08:38.251 --> 08:40.888
neutralizing pollutants
and removing toxins.

08:40.921 --> 08:44.057
It's like a Roomba
the size of a Fiat,

08:44.091 --> 08:46.994
only instead of cleaning floors,
this thing cleans oceans.

08:47.027 --> 08:50.430
Now, Lauren, was supposed to be
one of the finest

08:50.463 --> 08:52.332
clean-tech engineers
in the country.

08:52.365 --> 08:54.001
I brought her here
to spearhead that project.

08:54.034 --> 08:55.803
That was two years ago,

08:55.836 --> 08:58.071
and you want to know
how many MERMAs

08:58.105 --> 08:59.372
we've built since then?

09:00.373 --> 09:01.742
Zero.

09:01.775 --> 09:03.977
Hence your frustration
with Ms. Wexler.

09:04.011 --> 09:05.545
At the start,

09:05.579 --> 09:06.747
she was relentless.

09:06.780 --> 09:08.916
She did over a year
of field research.

09:08.949 --> 09:11.218
She traveled all
around the globe

09:11.251 --> 09:12.586
commissioning
prototypes.

09:12.620 --> 09:14.521
But then, about six months ago,

09:14.554 --> 09:17.390
she comes in here,
tells me the thing won't work.

09:17.424 --> 09:18.425
Project's a loser.

09:18.458 --> 09:19.593
(chuckling):
And I told her

09:19.627 --> 09:21.294
that was unacceptable,
and I sent her

09:21.328 --> 09:22.730
back to the drawing board.

09:22.763 --> 09:24.164
And when her attitude
didn't improve,

09:24.197 --> 09:25.733
I benched her, but...

09:25.766 --> 09:27.534
that is all I did.

09:27.567 --> 09:28.702
Can you account
for your whereabouts

09:28.736 --> 09:30.537
between 6:00 p.m.
and 12:00 midnight

09:30.570 --> 09:31.571
two nights ago?

09:31.605 --> 09:34.307
Is that when Lauren was killed?

09:34.341 --> 09:36.209
Just answer the question,
Mr. Salinger.

09:36.243 --> 09:39.212
Two nights ago, I was at
a yoga retreat in San Francisco.

09:39.246 --> 09:41.081
A bunch of us were.

09:41.114 --> 09:43.717
We just flew back on
the corporate jet this morning.

09:43.751 --> 09:46.687
In fact, I will get you
my pilot's information.

09:46.720 --> 09:50.423
(chuckling):
Hell, I will get you
my yogi's information.

09:50.457 --> 09:52.592
Hey, just out
of curiosity,

09:52.626 --> 09:55.595
has your investigation
brought you into contact

09:55.629 --> 09:57.765
with a man named Troy?

09:57.798 --> 10:00.433
No. Why?
Well...

10:00.467 --> 10:03.136
few weeks ago,
on a day when Lauren

10:03.170 --> 10:05.706
actually bothered
to show up for a meeting,

10:05.739 --> 10:07.574
she stepped outside
to take a call

10:07.607 --> 10:10.010
from someone by that name.

10:10.043 --> 10:13.180
I couldn't make out exactly
what she was saying, but...

10:13.213 --> 10:15.215
it was obviously an argument.

10:15.248 --> 10:18.285
Did your eavesdropping happen
to register Troy's last name?

10:18.318 --> 10:20.220
Sorry.

10:20.253 --> 10:22.589
Troy-- all I got.

10:27.795 --> 10:29.496
(door opens)

10:29.529 --> 10:31.298
BELL:
Hey.

10:31.331 --> 10:35.102
I, uh, just got off the phone
with Mr. Salinger's pilot.

10:35.135 --> 10:36.770
His alibi checks out.

10:36.804 --> 10:38.371
Where's Joan?

10:38.405 --> 10:40.540
She had to go home
to check on a houseguest.

10:40.573 --> 10:42.209
You guys have someone staying
with you at your place?

10:42.242 --> 10:44.411
Like, on purpose?

10:44.444 --> 10:47.580
Did Lauren Wexler's cell phone
company divulge her records?

10:47.614 --> 10:49.516
No. Shouldn't be long.

10:49.549 --> 10:52.720
Unless Troy was using a burner
when he called her,

10:52.753 --> 10:55.422
should be able to work backwards
to his subscriber information.

10:55.455 --> 10:56.724
Hmm.

10:56.757 --> 10:57.791
You look good, man.

10:57.825 --> 10:59.760
I mean, you know,

10:59.793 --> 11:02.295
compared to the last time
I saw you.

11:02.329 --> 11:03.731
It was difficult being away.

11:03.764 --> 11:05.265
But I hear
the department has done

11:05.298 --> 11:06.533
adequate work in my absence.

11:06.566 --> 11:09.436
(laughing): Yeah, well,
we are the police.

11:09.469 --> 11:12.873
They don't call us "New York's
most adequate" for nothing.

11:12.906 --> 11:15.242
What is all
this stuff anyway?

11:15.275 --> 11:18.879
It's the contents of Lauren
Wexler's work space at Pathas.

11:18.912 --> 11:20.647
I had Mr. Salinger send it over.

11:20.680 --> 11:24.084
Did her drinking bird tell you
much about who killed her?

11:24.117 --> 11:25.753
No.

11:25.786 --> 11:27.955
But this leaflet did.

11:27.988 --> 11:31.892
"Home care instructions for
sutures, stitches and staples."

11:31.925 --> 11:34.561
According to the receipt on
the back, she received stitches

11:34.594 --> 11:36.629
at an urgent care facility

11:36.663 --> 11:37.664
last month in Fishkill.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.499
That's nowhere near
her residence.

11:39.532 --> 11:40.533
Or the Pathas offices.

11:40.567 --> 11:42.169
So, what was she doing there?

11:42.202 --> 11:44.471
What, she was buying a hoodie?

11:44.504 --> 11:47.474
No. Have a look
at the left sleeve.

11:50.844 --> 11:52.980
You know this
isn't blood, right?

11:53.013 --> 11:54.782
It's red paint.
It's not red.

11:54.815 --> 11:56.716
It's Farmhouse Wagon Sienna.

11:56.750 --> 12:00.020
Now, there are only three homes
in the area surrounding

12:00.053 --> 12:01.755
the urgent care clinic
which have elements

12:01.789 --> 12:03.423
painted that precise color.

12:03.456 --> 12:05.458
And out of those three,

12:05.492 --> 12:07.895
only this one is owned

12:07.928 --> 12:10.430
by Troy Roselli.

12:12.800 --> 12:15.035
You can tell Ms. Wexler's
cell phone company

12:15.068 --> 12:16.503
they can keep her records.

12:16.536 --> 12:18.271
I'm going to
tell Watson

12:18.305 --> 12:19.873
to meet us in Fishkill.

12:23.110 --> 12:24.477
Can I help you?

12:24.511 --> 12:25.545
Troy Roselli?

12:25.578 --> 12:26.679
Detective Marcus Bell.

12:26.713 --> 12:28.481
My colleagues and I
want to talk

12:28.515 --> 12:29.883
to you about Lauren Wexler.

12:29.917 --> 12:31.551
Who?
HOLMES:
We believe she paid

12:31.584 --> 12:32.953
a visit here
last month.

12:32.986 --> 12:35.722
Soon followed by a trip
to the emergency care clinic.

12:35.755 --> 12:37.190
Uh, I'm sorry.

12:37.224 --> 12:38.691
Never heard of her.

12:38.725 --> 12:40.060
See you had
your garage door

12:40.093 --> 12:41.461
painted recently.

12:41.494 --> 12:42.629
It's nice. I like it.

12:42.662 --> 12:44.464
Thanks.

12:44.497 --> 12:47.300
You wouldn't happen to have
a late-model Japanese sedan

12:47.334 --> 12:48.701
in there, would you?

12:48.735 --> 12:50.637
No, I, uh... I don't own a car.

12:50.670 --> 12:52.472
You mind showing us?

12:52.505 --> 12:54.074
No.

12:55.542 --> 12:58.711
Let me, uh, just throw
on some clothes.

13:01.781 --> 13:05.052
Well, he's obviously lying
about not knowing Lauren Wexler.

13:05.085 --> 13:07.754
And about not having
anything in his garage.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.689
(distant door opening)

13:09.722 --> 13:11.758
Back door just opened.
He's running.

13:16.796 --> 13:18.731
And there goes
the towel.

13:18.765 --> 13:21.334
Stop right there!

13:21.368 --> 13:23.336
I'll call local
PD for backup.

13:23.370 --> 13:25.172
You two wait here.

13:25.205 --> 13:26.773
Well, should we help him or...?

13:26.806 --> 13:29.242
Well, normally I would,
but you saw the towel drop.

13:29.276 --> 13:30.911
Mr. Roselli
couldn't be more unarmed.

13:30.944 --> 13:32.913
Unless you think he's got
a weapon up his...

13:32.946 --> 13:34.681
Let's just go look
at the garage.

13:38.251 --> 13:42.755
I wanted you to know
that I am happy for you.

13:42.789 --> 13:46.793
Your decision to become
a parent-- I support it.

13:48.395 --> 13:49.596
You do?

13:49.629 --> 13:51.131
Why wouldn't I?
Are you forgetting

13:51.164 --> 13:53.633
I was in the room with you
when you told a pregnant woman

13:53.666 --> 13:55.535
that procreation
was the only act

13:55.568 --> 13:57.770
more masturbatory
than masturbation?

13:57.804 --> 14:01.241
She was a murder suspect,
and besides, you're adopting.

14:01.274 --> 14:03.643
You started looking
for somewhere to live?

14:03.676 --> 14:05.312
What?

14:05.345 --> 14:07.080
No. Why?
Well,

14:07.114 --> 14:08.848
there's not an adoption agency
on the planet that would

14:08.882 --> 14:11.051
hand an infant to a woman
who lives with a heroin addict.

14:11.084 --> 14:12.652
You are in recovery.

14:12.685 --> 14:13.853
Watson.
You know what?

14:13.887 --> 14:15.622
Look, I already spoke
to my attorney,

14:15.655 --> 14:18.358
and he knows that if my
lifestyle is a deal breaker,

14:18.391 --> 14:19.927
then I'm not
going to adopt.

14:19.960 --> 14:21.594
Anyway, I think the
bigger question is--

14:21.628 --> 14:24.431
how are you going to feel
about having a kid around?

14:24.464 --> 14:27.034
I mean, I would not expect
you to co-parent or anything.

14:27.067 --> 14:28.701
The baby would be
my responsibility.

14:28.735 --> 14:30.670
You said that about Clyde.

14:31.738 --> 14:34.507
I am not talking
about a tortoise here.

14:36.343 --> 14:38.545
For you, Watson...

14:38.578 --> 14:40.880
I'd make adjustments.

14:40.914 --> 14:42.782
Always.

15:06.606 --> 15:08.942
Am I crazy, or is that a MERMA?

15:08.976 --> 15:10.810
The supposedly
impossible-to-build

15:10.843 --> 15:12.712
ocean cleaner?

15:12.745 --> 15:15.115
Without question.

15:18.551 --> 15:21.121
I'm beginning to think
that Lauren Wexler

15:21.154 --> 15:22.689
wasn't so incompetent

15:22.722 --> 15:24.924
after all.

15:24.958 --> 15:26.759
No, she wasn't incompetent.

15:28.261 --> 15:29.529
She was a thief.

15:39.006 --> 15:42.709
Look, when you guys came
into my door, I swear to God,

15:42.742 --> 15:44.744
I had no idea Lauren was dead.

15:44.777 --> 15:46.579
Well, someone at her office
overheard you two

15:46.613 --> 15:48.148
arguing over the phone
a few weeks ago.

15:48.181 --> 15:51.018
Look, I'm not saying
I liked Lauren.

15:51.051 --> 15:52.652
I'm just saying
I wouldn't have hurt her.

15:52.685 --> 15:54.754
You already lied to us
once today, Mr. Roselli.

15:54.787 --> 15:56.789
You told us there was nothing
in your garage.

15:56.823 --> 15:58.925
So, why should we
believe you now?

15:58.958 --> 16:01.728
I lied for the same reason
I ran away.

16:01.761 --> 16:03.930
Okay? That.

16:03.963 --> 16:04.897
The MERMA.

16:04.931 --> 16:06.933
(Troy sighs)

16:06.966 --> 16:08.301
Wish I'd never even heard
of the stupid thing.

16:08.335 --> 16:09.469
You're an engineer.

16:09.502 --> 16:10.837
You were helping Lauren
build it, right?

16:10.870 --> 16:13.940
Yes. I was out of work
when she reached out to me.

16:13.973 --> 16:15.075
I needed the money.

16:15.108 --> 16:17.477
That trip to the
emergency care clinic--

16:17.510 --> 16:19.646
she cut her hand when we were
replacing a propeller blade.

16:19.679 --> 16:21.981
You were aware the plans
she gave you were stolen?

16:22.015 --> 16:23.850
Yeah.

16:23.883 --> 16:25.918
Lauren told me
she took a job at Pathas

16:25.952 --> 16:27.587
because she believed
in the MERMA.

16:27.620 --> 16:29.856
She knew oil companies
would pay through the nose

16:29.889 --> 16:31.858
to clean up spills.

16:31.891 --> 16:33.860
But then, about a year
into the project,

16:33.893 --> 16:36.729
the guy who owns the company,
Salinger,

16:36.763 --> 16:38.798
he decides to open-source
all the tech.

16:38.831 --> 16:40.633
HOLMES:
So the companies
you're referring to

16:40.667 --> 16:42.835
would be able to build
their own MERMA vehicles.

16:42.869 --> 16:44.637
Companies, governments.

16:44.671 --> 16:46.873
Anyone who wanted
to help clean up the ocean.

16:46.906 --> 16:48.175
Pathas wouldn't
make a dime.

16:48.208 --> 16:49.876
Lauren freaked.

16:49.909 --> 16:51.811
She had points in the project.

16:51.844 --> 16:54.414
So she stole all the plans,
started working with you.

16:54.447 --> 16:56.483
She was gonna beat Pathas
to the market.

16:56.516 --> 16:58.017
What about the lawsuits
that would follow?

16:58.051 --> 16:59.786
She thought we could change
the tech just enough

16:59.819 --> 17:01.888
to make it hard
for Pathas to build a case.

17:04.223 --> 17:06.393
Maybe Salinger found out
about what we were doing,

17:06.425 --> 17:08.595
killed her
'cause he was so ticked.

17:08.627 --> 17:10.797
Actually, Mr. Salinger
has an alibi

17:10.829 --> 17:12.299
for the time of the murder.

17:12.332 --> 17:14.101
He didn't do it.
Well, then maybe it was

17:14.134 --> 17:15.935
one of the other people
Lauren stole from.

17:15.968 --> 17:17.670
What other people?

17:17.704 --> 17:19.939
The idea of the MERMA
came from Pathas, but...

17:19.972 --> 17:22.709
the tech came from inventors
from all over the world.

17:22.742 --> 17:24.243
BELL:
Mr. Salinger
said something

17:24.277 --> 17:25.978
about Lauren traveling a lot,

17:26.012 --> 17:27.914
commissioning pitches
from people.

17:27.946 --> 17:29.149
Yeah, different
engineers

17:29.182 --> 17:31.084
were supposed to work
on different components.

17:31.118 --> 17:33.286
In the end, she poached
the best ideas she heard.

17:33.320 --> 17:34.954
How would those people
have found out

17:34.987 --> 17:36.789
you guys built your own MERMA?

17:39.226 --> 17:41.894
I guess it could've been
during a test drive.

17:41.928 --> 17:44.897
That prototype you saw,
it's fully functional.

17:44.931 --> 17:46.966
Lauren took it out
on the Hudson a few times

17:46.999 --> 17:48.601
to put it through the paces.

17:48.635 --> 17:50.337
Maybe the wrong person
saw her do it.

17:52.972 --> 17:56.042
* Confusion, days of delusion

17:56.075 --> 18:00.347
* Take me through...

18:00.380 --> 18:02.182
I'm sorry about that.
(chuckles)

18:02.215 --> 18:04.951
Feels like I spend half my life
in the bathroom these days.

18:04.984 --> 18:06.353
Well, you're pregnant,

18:06.386 --> 18:08.255
so it sort of comes
with the territory.

18:08.288 --> 18:11.057
I was telling you
about Brody, right?

18:11.090 --> 18:13.460
Yeah. The father.
Yes.

18:13.493 --> 18:15.628
He's a very sweet guy.

18:15.662 --> 18:16.929
Very cute.

18:16.963 --> 18:19.466
No interest
in being a dad, but...

18:19.499 --> 18:21.334
Hey, just so
you know,

18:21.368 --> 18:23.936
um, what happened...

18:23.970 --> 18:25.938
it's not like me at all.

18:25.972 --> 18:27.674
I don't sleep around.

18:27.707 --> 18:30.143
Honestly, it's really
none of my business.

18:30.177 --> 18:32.745
I know, but it's
important to me.

18:32.779 --> 18:34.247
Because I was raised
a certain way,

18:34.281 --> 18:36.883
and I didn't even date
until I got to college, so...

18:36.916 --> 18:38.751
if things work out
between you and me,

18:38.785 --> 18:40.787
I just want you to be able
to tell people

18:40.820 --> 18:42.989
that the biological mom
wasn't a slut.

18:43.956 --> 18:45.892
You have my word.

18:46.993 --> 18:48.461
So, your parents

18:48.495 --> 18:49.962
sound pretty conservative.

18:49.996 --> 18:51.798
How did they take it
when you told them

18:51.831 --> 18:53.833
that you were gonna
give the baby up for adoption?

18:53.866 --> 18:55.468
They practically threw a party.

18:56.869 --> 18:58.871
Ladies, here you go.

18:58.905 --> 18:59.806
Thank you.

18:59.839 --> 19:00.973
You're welcome.
Thanks.

19:03.776 --> 19:06.846
So, you swear you and your
partner never slept together?

19:06.879 --> 19:07.880
No. Never.

19:07.914 --> 19:10.717
And you're not a lesbian?

19:10.750 --> 19:12.919
No.
Sorry, it's just--

19:12.952 --> 19:13.786
he's hot, you're hot.

19:13.820 --> 19:15.322
You'd make a great couple.

19:17.056 --> 19:19.091
You would be surprised
how often we don't hear that.

19:19.125 --> 19:20.860
In the form you filled out
for your attorney,

19:20.893 --> 19:22.895
it said that you
used to be a doctor.

19:22.929 --> 19:26.499
Mm-hmm. Well, technically,
um, I still am a doctor.

19:26.533 --> 19:27.834
Well...

19:27.867 --> 19:29.135
how did your parents take it

19:29.168 --> 19:31.003
when you told them
you were giving that up

19:31.037 --> 19:32.839
to be a detective?
Um, you know,

19:32.872 --> 19:34.207
it took them
some time to adjust.

19:34.241 --> 19:36.476
I'll bet it did.

19:36.509 --> 19:37.877
All the time you put in,

19:37.910 --> 19:40.680
all the money
they put in, God...

19:40.713 --> 19:42.014
I couldn't do that.

19:42.048 --> 19:43.783
Not ever.

19:43.816 --> 19:46.919
I'm sorry if that
sounds judgmental, but...

19:46.953 --> 19:49.889
judging you is kind of
the whole point of this trip.

19:49.922 --> 19:52.925
It's okay. I mean, you have to
go through your process, right?

19:56.663 --> 19:59.832
Am I crazy, or did I see a bunch
of beehives on your roof?

20:03.670 --> 20:05.071
(footsteps approaching)

20:05.104 --> 20:06.839
How was your breakfast?

20:06.873 --> 20:08.875
I cannot remember
the last time

20:08.908 --> 20:11.344
I was so intimidated
by a 20-year-old.

20:11.378 --> 20:14.013
She kept calling my situation
unconventional.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.882
I've had more
than one career.

20:15.915 --> 20:17.149
I live with my business partner.

20:17.183 --> 20:19.218
Conventional is the enemy
of interesting.

20:19.252 --> 20:21.053
I don't think she sees it
that way.

20:21.087 --> 20:23.055
Were you jogging?
My PCS may be in remission,

20:23.089 --> 20:25.858
but I have no intention of
ditching the regimen I adopted

20:25.892 --> 20:27.694
to treat it. Speaking
of which, would it have

20:27.727 --> 20:29.095
killed you to change
the water in

20:29.128 --> 20:30.897
my sensory deprivation tank
while I was away?

20:30.930 --> 20:33.266
Oh, how'd it go
with Troy Roselli last night?

20:33.300 --> 20:34.834
Did he confess?
Only to being

20:34.867 --> 20:36.536
an accessory
to intellectual theft.

20:36.569 --> 20:37.837
He has an alibi
for the night

20:37.870 --> 20:39.439
Lauren Wexler was murdered.

20:39.472 --> 20:41.474
(sighs)
So we're back to square one.

20:41.508 --> 20:43.343
Hardly.

20:43.376 --> 20:47.046
He thought that in her
fervor to build MERMA,

20:47.079 --> 20:49.649
she stole not
only from Pathas

20:49.682 --> 20:53.152
but also from inventors
all across the globe.

20:53.185 --> 20:54.954
He thought perhaps
one of them discovered

20:54.987 --> 20:56.556
her betrayal when
she began testing

20:56.589 --> 20:58.925
her prototype
in the Hudson River.

20:58.958 --> 21:00.627
WATSON:
She kept a video log.

21:00.660 --> 21:02.261
HOLMES:
Quite extensive ones.

21:03.596 --> 21:05.298
And do they show anyone
spying on her?

21:05.332 --> 21:07.900
As it turns out,
someone thought

21:07.934 --> 21:10.337
she was the one
doing the spying.

21:10.370 --> 21:12.305
MAN: How many times
I gotta tell you,

21:12.339 --> 21:14.374
you can't be here.

21:14.407 --> 21:16.809
How far am I from your
construction site?

21:16.843 --> 21:18.144
A thousand feet?

21:18.177 --> 21:19.579
I'm not bothering anyone,

21:19.612 --> 21:21.213
and the last time I
checked, the Hudson River

21:21.247 --> 21:22.715
was public property.

21:22.749 --> 21:24.784
Then do us both a favor
and jump in.

21:24.817 --> 21:26.786
'Cause the land you're
standing on is private property.

21:26.819 --> 21:28.555
Look, every time
you come out here,

21:28.588 --> 21:30.557
my bosses are gonna
make me chase you away.

21:30.590 --> 21:32.291
I'm not going anywhere.
(scoffs) Lady...

21:32.325 --> 21:34.594
these guys,
they don't mess around.

21:34.627 --> 21:36.363
Okay, next time,
they won't send a guard.

21:36.396 --> 21:37.930
They'll send one
of their people,

21:37.964 --> 21:39.999
and it won't turn out well
for you-- trust me.

21:40.032 --> 21:43.336
Now, when she continues to
ignore him, he goes away.

21:45.472 --> 21:48.741
But I have a theory as to why
his employers were so troubled.

21:48.775 --> 21:52.078
These are the results
of Ms. Wexler's tests.

21:52.111 --> 21:54.414
Levels of heavy metals--
lead, arsenic,

21:54.447 --> 21:55.548
cadmium, copper--

21:55.582 --> 21:56.916
well above EPA levels.

21:56.949 --> 21:59.519
So, you think the people
behind the construction site

21:59.552 --> 22:01.721
were dumping waste
into the river.

22:01.754 --> 22:03.956
Are you sure these results
are accurate?

22:03.990 --> 22:06.859
I'm not, so I'm about to
bring them to my Irregular Gay.

22:06.893 --> 22:08.060
That didn't
sound right.

22:08.094 --> 22:09.796
She's not my irregular gay.

22:09.829 --> 22:12.164
Her name is Gay,
and she is an Irregular.

22:12.198 --> 22:14.166
I know.
I introduced her to you.

22:14.200 --> 22:15.835
But this is about
water pollution.

22:15.868 --> 22:17.036
She's a geologist.

22:17.069 --> 22:19.872
But her subspeciality
is hydrogeology.

22:19.906 --> 22:20.873
Now, unfortunately,
these videos

22:20.907 --> 22:21.974
never captured the
site in question

22:22.008 --> 22:23.810
or any of its signage,
so I thought,

22:23.843 --> 22:26.178
while I'm with Gay,
you could visit

22:26.212 --> 22:28.214
the Dutchess County Department
of Buildings and Safety,

22:28.247 --> 22:29.482
because the site in
question would've

22:29.516 --> 22:32.184
had to log paperwork with them.

22:32.218 --> 22:34.253
Let's see.

22:34.286 --> 22:39.859
Parcel FN10970-1B,

22:39.892 --> 22:43.763
lot 993482,

22:43.796 --> 22:46.799
east bank of
the river.

22:46.833 --> 22:50.837
Says here that permit was issued
to Topaz Valley Industries.

22:50.870 --> 22:52.639
Any chance I could get a copy?

22:52.672 --> 22:55.374
Sure.
Thanks.

22:55.408 --> 22:58.745
Did you know
that you're the second person

22:58.778 --> 23:00.680
to ask about that parcel
recently?

23:00.713 --> 23:02.048
Am I?

23:02.081 --> 23:04.050
Another woman came in last week.

23:06.085 --> 23:08.521
Her name wasn't Lauren Wexler,
by any chance, was it?

23:08.555 --> 23:10.189
Sounds right.

23:10.222 --> 23:12.892
But my boss is the one
who ended up helping her.

23:12.925 --> 23:14.126
Mr. Pickering?

23:16.295 --> 23:18.397
Do you remember the woman
that came in to ask

23:18.431 --> 23:20.299
about the construction
going on by the river?

23:20.332 --> 23:21.534
Her name was
Lauren, right?

23:21.568 --> 23:22.802
That's right.

23:22.835 --> 23:23.903
Something I can
help you with?

23:23.936 --> 23:25.672
I work with the police.

23:25.705 --> 23:28.174
Ms. Wexler was murdered
a few days ago.

23:28.207 --> 23:30.677
Oh, my.
We think
it might have

23:30.710 --> 23:33.312
something to do with the company
that you issued this permit to.

23:33.345 --> 23:34.981
Did she say why

23:35.014 --> 23:36.248
she was looking into them?

23:36.282 --> 23:38.518
Marjorie, would
you mind helping

23:38.551 --> 23:39.952
this gentleman
over here, please?

23:39.986 --> 23:41.954
Thank you.

23:45.958 --> 23:47.894
Look, I'll tell you
everything I know,

23:47.927 --> 23:50.463
but please, you just gotta
keep my name out of it.

23:50.497 --> 23:52.098
Why is that?

23:52.131 --> 23:54.934
When Ms. Wexler came in,
I told her

23:54.967 --> 23:56.669
she has to be careful.

23:56.703 --> 23:58.705
Topaz Valley Industries
is dangerous.

23:58.738 --> 24:00.707
What do you mean?

24:00.740 --> 24:02.241
Approving construction
permits takes time.

24:02.274 --> 24:04.076
We were only a few
months into our process.

24:04.110 --> 24:06.145
I was leaving the
office one night,

24:06.178 --> 24:09.248
and a man in a
ski mask put a gun

24:09.281 --> 24:10.583
to the back of my head.

24:10.617 --> 24:11.751
He told me the permit

24:11.784 --> 24:13.185
for Topaz Valley
had to be issued

24:13.219 --> 24:15.622
by the end of the week,
or he'd be back.

24:15.655 --> 24:16.956
I came in the
next morning,

24:16.989 --> 24:19.859
and I forced the
permit through.

24:19.892 --> 24:21.561
Look, you work
with the police,

24:21.594 --> 24:23.362
so I probably don't
have to tell you this.

24:23.395 --> 24:25.665
Organized crime and the
construction business,

24:25.698 --> 24:29.168
they got a funny way of
going together sometimes.

24:29.201 --> 24:30.770
WATSON: Hey, are you still
at Gay's office?

24:30.803 --> 24:32.572
No, I'm at the site
where Lauren Wexler

24:32.605 --> 24:33.973
was testing her MERMA.

24:34.006 --> 24:34.974
Why?

24:35.007 --> 24:36.208
Gay took one look at the data

24:36.242 --> 24:38.745
and said she needed to
do some on-site testing.

24:38.778 --> 24:41.347
Once we're done, we have to
go directly to the precinct.

24:41.380 --> 24:42.982
Even if there are heavy metals
in the water,

24:43.015 --> 24:44.651
we can't prove they came
from the construction site.

24:44.684 --> 24:45.852
Funny thing
about that construction site.

24:45.885 --> 24:47.353
It's abandoned.

24:47.386 --> 24:48.955
The work has moved on
without building a thing.

24:48.988 --> 24:50.957
That doesn't make any sense.
I just spoke to someone

24:50.990 --> 24:53.425
who said the people who own
the land threatened to kill him

24:53.459 --> 24:55.127
unless he issued
a construction permit.

24:55.161 --> 24:56.796
Yeah, it was a cover.

24:56.829 --> 24:58.831
It was a reason for their
trucks to be there.

24:58.865 --> 25:00.132
They never did
any construction.

25:00.166 --> 25:01.968
Nor did they dump
anything in the river.

25:02.001 --> 25:03.970
In fact, quite the opposite.
They took something out.

25:04.003 --> 25:05.137
They were siphoning sand.

25:05.171 --> 25:06.305
What are you talking about?

25:06.338 --> 25:07.674
I'm talking about one of

25:07.707 --> 25:10.342
the most in-demand natural
resources on the planet.

25:10.376 --> 25:13.045
Sand is an essential
ingredient in concrete,

25:13.079 --> 25:15.047
detergent, silicon chips,

25:15.081 --> 25:17.249
but its supply is finite.

25:17.283 --> 25:19.418
So those in the business
of sand are always looking

25:19.451 --> 25:22.288
for new ways and new
places to extract it.

25:22.321 --> 25:24.423
You think that's
why Lauren Wexler was killed?

25:24.456 --> 25:25.992
She figured out
what Topaz Valley was doing?

25:26.025 --> 25:27.927
I do. I also think
it's the reason

25:27.960 --> 25:29.962
that hundreds more might die
if we don't act quickly.

25:29.996 --> 25:31.130
What do you mean?

25:31.163 --> 25:32.899
I mean the men
who were working here

25:32.932 --> 25:34.901
siphoned enough sand
from the riverbed

25:34.934 --> 25:36.903
to destabilize
the support piers

25:36.936 --> 25:38.838
on the bridge
that I'm looking at.

25:38.871 --> 25:40.873
Gay thinks it's on the
verge of collapse.

25:51.017 --> 25:53.552
I sure as hell wouldn't want
to drink it, but how does this

25:53.586 --> 25:54.921
prove that Maracott Bridge
is about to collapse?

25:54.954 --> 25:56.756
That sample, taken today
from the water

25:56.789 --> 25:58.725
beneath the bridge, shows,
amongst other things,

25:58.758 --> 26:00.593
an excess of limestone.

26:00.627 --> 26:02.061
Why is that
important?

26:02.094 --> 26:04.063
Because limestone
is the material

26:04.096 --> 26:05.765
which the bridge support pylons
are made of.

26:05.798 --> 26:07.934
High concentrations of it
indicates

26:07.967 --> 26:10.136
that the support pylons
are eroding.

26:10.169 --> 26:11.437
BELL: Hold up.
I thought we were

26:11.470 --> 26:13.806
talking about sand,
not limestone.

26:13.840 --> 26:15.007
WATSON: We are.
The extraction of the sand

26:15.041 --> 26:16.876
is what caused the erosion.

26:16.909 --> 26:19.411
Here. I made a model
on my computer.

26:19.445 --> 26:22.581
I think this will help.
(sighs)

26:24.784 --> 26:27.687
Tons of sand got siphoned
off the east bank here,

26:27.720 --> 26:29.021
reducing its size.

26:29.055 --> 26:31.724
Now, that, in turn,
made the river wider,

26:31.758 --> 26:33.793
which means more
and more water is flowing

26:33.826 --> 26:36.796
through this part of it
at faster speeds.

26:36.829 --> 26:37.897
Now, if the guys
doing the siphoning

26:37.930 --> 26:39.031
had just stopped there,

26:39.065 --> 26:41.634
maybe we're not having
this conversation,

26:41.668 --> 26:43.770
but if I'm right,
they got greedy.

26:43.803 --> 26:45.071
They started
using hoses

26:45.104 --> 26:47.473
to extract sand from the bottom
of the river, too.

26:47.506 --> 26:49.676
That's why the woman
who was murdered

26:49.709 --> 26:51.878
found such high concentrations
of heavy metals.

26:51.911 --> 26:54.647
Sand acts
as a natural barrier

26:54.681 --> 26:56.515
against heavy metals
in the earth's crust.

26:56.548 --> 26:58.017
You remove the sand, and...

26:58.050 --> 27:00.853
You get more of them
seeping into the water.

27:00.887 --> 27:05.057
Meanwhile, the sand protecting
this limestone pylon is gone,

27:05.091 --> 27:08.060
and the water moving past it
is going faster and faster.

27:08.094 --> 27:10.596
Eventually, gravity takes over,
and then...

27:12.765 --> 27:14.600
Hmm. I'll call
the state police

27:14.633 --> 27:15.935
and the Department
of Transportation

27:15.968 --> 27:17.403
and get them on
this right away.

27:17.436 --> 27:19.772
In the meantime,
I'd like to get someone

27:19.806 --> 27:21.808
from Topaz Valley Industries
in here.

27:21.841 --> 27:23.542
HOLMES:
That's easier
said than done.

27:23.575 --> 27:25.011
It's a shell corporation.

27:25.044 --> 27:26.178
WATSON:
The man I spoke to at

27:26.212 --> 27:27.313
the Department
of Building and Safety

27:27.346 --> 27:28.580
in Dutchess County

27:28.614 --> 27:29.982
thought it was a front
for organized crime.

27:30.016 --> 27:31.751
HOLMES:
I suspected as much.

27:31.784 --> 27:34.420
More specifically,
I suspected an Indian group--

27:34.453 --> 27:37.089
recently expanded their
operations stateside.

27:37.123 --> 27:38.691
The Sand Mafia.

27:38.725 --> 27:40.359
BELL:
The Sand Mafia?

27:40.392 --> 27:41.761
That's seriously
what they call themselves?

27:41.794 --> 27:42.895
It's a name
they were given

27:42.929 --> 27:44.797
in India, where their activities

27:44.831 --> 27:47.767
have resulted in hundreds
of murders in recent years.

27:47.800 --> 27:49.836
Now, they're made up of
many different factions,

27:49.869 --> 27:52.538
not unlike the American Mob,
but only one of those factions

27:52.571 --> 27:54.206
has a representative
here in New York.

27:56.876 --> 27:59.645
You think this is the guy
who killed Lauren Wexler?

27:59.678 --> 28:01.313
His name is Vikrant Jindal.

28:01.347 --> 28:03.082
Now, I doubt that he
did the deed himself.

28:03.115 --> 28:04.917
In India, he was notorious
for a very particular

28:04.951 --> 28:06.819
method of murder.

28:08.888 --> 28:10.189
Are those drill holes?
Yeah.

28:10.222 --> 28:12.258
From his signature tool,
a power drill.

28:12.291 --> 28:14.593
Now, lucky for us,
Mr. Jindal is also

28:14.626 --> 28:15.895
particular about
his eating habits.

28:15.928 --> 28:18.430
I have it on good authority
that he eats lunch

28:18.464 --> 28:20.232
every single day
at his brother's restaurant.

28:20.266 --> 28:21.600
So...

28:21.633 --> 28:22.935
you fancy a curry?

28:24.871 --> 28:27.706
(Indian music playing)

28:27.740 --> 28:30.877
Mr. Jindal, enjoying
your aloo matar, I hope,

28:30.910 --> 28:32.812
lest the chef's skull

28:32.845 --> 28:33.712
soon resemble a colander.

28:34.914 --> 28:36.415
Before you sic
your henchmen on us,

28:36.448 --> 28:37.716
let me introduce my colleagues.

28:37.750 --> 28:38.951
This is Detective Bell.

28:38.985 --> 28:39.952
This is Joan Watson.

28:39.986 --> 28:41.954
My name's
Sherlock Holmes.

28:41.988 --> 28:43.956
We were hoping that
you might discuss

28:43.990 --> 28:45.792
the murder of
Lauren Wexler with us.

28:46.993 --> 28:48.795
Am I supposed to
know that name?

28:48.828 --> 28:50.662
BELL: She spent
a lot of time

28:50.696 --> 28:53.399
around your construction site
near the Maracott Bridge.

28:53.432 --> 28:56.668
We think she realized that all
the sand removal you were doing

28:56.702 --> 28:58.270
was gonna bring
the bridge down,

28:58.304 --> 28:59.671
so you had her killed.

28:59.705 --> 29:02.441
Sorry, I don't know this woman.

29:02.474 --> 29:04.811
And none of the work we did
would have affected that bridge.

29:04.844 --> 29:06.712
HOLMES:
Just like the work

29:06.745 --> 29:09.148
your organization did
in New Delhi last year

29:09.181 --> 29:12.518
didn't affect this bridge.

29:12.551 --> 29:14.453
(Jindal chuckles)

29:14.486 --> 29:17.289
This is New York,
not New Delhi.

29:17.323 --> 29:19.758
We would never allow something
like that to happen here.

29:19.792 --> 29:21.894
Is that supposed to mean
that you value American lives

29:21.928 --> 29:23.495
more than you value Indian ones?

29:23.529 --> 29:26.899
What I value is the
American dollar.

29:26.933 --> 29:29.936
There are more regulations here
and more risk of lawsuits.

29:29.969 --> 29:32.038
We tread more carefully
in this country.

29:32.071 --> 29:33.472
Now, before we
bought the land

29:33.505 --> 29:34.841
that you're referring to,

29:34.874 --> 29:37.476
we agreed to pay
for impact testing,

29:37.509 --> 29:40.479
performed by the Department
of Building and Safety

29:40.512 --> 29:41.713
in Dutchess County.

29:41.747 --> 29:42.748
We told them

29:42.781 --> 29:44.884
we were going to extract
the sand,

29:44.917 --> 29:47.686
and we were given a
report that guaranteed us

29:47.719 --> 29:50.722
there wasn't going to be
any danger to the bridge.

29:50.756 --> 29:52.358
I was at that department
this morning.

29:52.391 --> 29:53.860
There were no such
reports issued.

29:53.893 --> 29:55.494
Then you didn't look
hard enough.

29:55.527 --> 29:56.662
Give my men

29:56.695 --> 29:58.264
your e-mail addresses.

29:58.297 --> 29:59.798
You'll have copies from
my attorney within the hour.

30:03.836 --> 30:04.837
(door opens and closes)

30:04.871 --> 30:06.939
How'd it go with Dr. Hanson?

30:06.973 --> 30:08.374
He agrees I'm much improved

30:08.407 --> 30:09.842
after taking
the last few months off,

30:09.876 --> 30:11.310
although he insists
I remain vigilant.

30:11.343 --> 30:13.712
Most of my hobbies
remain off the menu,

30:13.745 --> 30:15.247
including some sex acts.

30:15.281 --> 30:18.150
Is that the paperwork
from Vikrant Jindal's attorney?

30:18.184 --> 30:20.152
Yeah, he e-mailed
a zip file

30:20.186 --> 30:21.888
right after you left
for your appointment.

30:21.921 --> 30:23.455
And?
It's like he said.

30:23.489 --> 30:24.756
He told Dutchess County
they were

30:24.790 --> 30:25.724
going to extract the sand.

30:25.757 --> 30:26.959
Could be a forgery.

30:26.993 --> 30:28.394
I don't know.
Looks legit.

30:28.427 --> 30:29.628
But I am going to go to

30:29.661 --> 30:30.629
the Building and Safety
Department tomorrow

30:30.662 --> 30:31.730
to make sure.

30:31.763 --> 30:32.965
In the meantime,
I sent a copy to Gay.

30:32.999 --> 30:34.967
She took one look, and
she said the inspector

30:35.001 --> 30:38.971
who allegedly signed off on
all this work, a Romeo Garza,

30:39.005 --> 30:40.072
was either terminally stupid

30:40.106 --> 30:42.041
or he wanted that bridge
to come down.

30:42.074 --> 30:44.010
And why would he want that?

30:44.043 --> 30:46.913
I don't know. Maybe he's
a very patient terrorist.

30:46.946 --> 30:48.514
Until we can get in
a room with him,

30:48.547 --> 30:49.848
I'm gonna assume
that Jindal's men

30:49.882 --> 30:51.017
forced him to write
that report

30:51.050 --> 30:52.418
just like they forced his boss

30:52.451 --> 30:53.920
to approve that permit.

30:53.953 --> 30:55.421
Marcus went to pick him up
a little while ago.

30:55.454 --> 30:57.123
He's gonna call us when
they're both at the precinct.

30:57.156 --> 30:58.190
Is that Kelsey downstairs,
is it?

30:58.224 --> 30:59.425
Yeah, she said
she had midterms.

30:59.458 --> 31:01.227
She wanted a quiet place
to study.

31:01.260 --> 31:03.930
Either that, or she's
already decided

31:03.963 --> 31:06.132
I would make a terrible mother
and she does not want

31:06.165 --> 31:08.700
to look me in the eye again
before she leaves tomorrow.

31:08.734 --> 31:11.971
I'll try not to disturb her
when I make my supper.

31:15.841 --> 31:17.309
Evening.

31:17.343 --> 31:19.111
Hi.

31:23.615 --> 31:26.218
Do you need me to study
someplace else or...?

31:26.252 --> 31:27.519
No.

31:27.553 --> 31:30.957
I was, uh, hoping we might talk.

31:30.990 --> 31:32.758
Sure.

31:40.199 --> 31:43.469
Watson was saying that you might
have some concerns

31:43.502 --> 31:46.172
about our living arrangement,
so, uh,

31:46.205 --> 31:49.942
I was thinking perhaps
I could allay them.

31:49.976 --> 31:52.244
(chuckles) I wouldn't
say I have concerns.

31:52.278 --> 31:55.281
It's just... a lot
to think about.

31:55.314 --> 31:57.716
So that's what I'm doing--
I'm thinking about it.

31:57.749 --> 32:01.087
She told me that you were aware
of my-my personal history.

32:01.120 --> 32:02.688
You know I'm
a recovering addict.

32:02.721 --> 32:04.790
Mm-hmm.
Doesn't concern you?

32:04.823 --> 32:06.092
Should it?

32:07.126 --> 32:09.661
I want you to know that...

32:09.695 --> 32:13.599
if you deem Watson the best
candidate to raise your child,

32:13.632 --> 32:15.601
and if you decide to
give her that gift,

32:15.634 --> 32:17.336
I could leave.

32:17.369 --> 32:19.505
Wait, what do you mean,
you could leave?

32:19.538 --> 32:20.606
I mean I could go away.

32:21.740 --> 32:23.709
We wouldn't have
to share a home.

32:23.742 --> 32:27.046
I know for a fact
that's not what she wants.

32:27.079 --> 32:29.148
You know, what we want
and what we need

32:29.181 --> 32:30.916
are very often
mutually exclusive.

32:30.949 --> 32:34.086
You think Joan needs
to be a mom?

32:34.120 --> 32:37.523
I think that when she told me
of her plan the other day,

32:37.556 --> 32:39.758
I was very surprised.

32:39.791 --> 32:41.760
But when you know her

32:41.793 --> 32:44.763
as well as I do,

32:44.796 --> 32:48.100
it makes sense
her being a parent.

32:48.134 --> 32:51.003
The child that she raises
will be very, very lucky.

32:52.104 --> 32:53.872
So, you think she could do it?

32:53.905 --> 32:55.107
Be a mom?

32:56.108 --> 32:58.277
I think she could do anything.

33:00.546 --> 33:02.048
(cell phone buzzes)

33:05.417 --> 33:06.718
Hmm.

33:06.752 --> 33:08.387
Something wrong?

33:09.621 --> 33:11.957
No, um, just a...

33:11.990 --> 33:15.561
a colleague of ours
was supposed to find a suspect.

33:15.594 --> 33:18.097
And he couldn't find him?

33:18.130 --> 33:19.631
He could.

33:19.665 --> 33:22.568
Just not in the, uh, condition
that we anticipated.

33:24.870 --> 33:26.972
BELL:
I count at least
five drill holes,

33:27.005 --> 33:28.874
just like that picture
you showed us at the precinct.

33:28.907 --> 33:32.244
Vikrant Jindal might as well
have signed his name.

33:32.278 --> 33:34.980
Hmm...
Romeo Garza had
to have been

33:35.013 --> 33:36.848
in cahoots with
the Sand Mafia, right?

33:36.882 --> 33:38.917
Jindal killed him
'cause he was a loose end.

33:38.950 --> 33:41.153
HOLMES:
Yeah, that's...

33:41.187 --> 33:43.755
precisely what we're meant
to believe.

33:43.789 --> 33:45.224
"Meant to"?

33:45.257 --> 33:47.793
Vikrant Jindal may be as
large an odorous piece

33:47.826 --> 33:49.361
of human excrement as
I've ever encountered,

33:49.395 --> 33:50.962
but I can tell you
with virtual certainty

33:50.996 --> 33:52.364
he didn't kill this man.

33:53.299 --> 33:54.800
He's being framed.

34:01.373 --> 34:03.242
GREGSON: This fits Vikrant
Jindal's M.O. to a T.

34:03.275 --> 34:05.844
What makes you think
he didn't do it?
His love of cows.

34:05.877 --> 34:08.347
When I visited Jindal
at his brother's restaurant,

34:08.380 --> 34:10.216
there was a Vaishnava
puja shrine.

34:10.248 --> 34:13.051
Vaishnava is a particularly
devout Hindu sect

34:13.085 --> 34:19.591
that hold cows to be sacred.

34:19.625 --> 34:21.493
Also of note, neither Jindal

34:21.527 --> 34:22.793
nor any
of his associates

34:22.828 --> 34:24.795
wore leather shoes or belts.

34:24.830 --> 34:26.264
And beef was conspicuously
absent from the menu.

34:26.297 --> 34:28.234
Okay, but the killer didn't
drill holes in a Guernsey.

34:28.266 --> 34:29.801
He did it to a person.

34:29.835 --> 34:33.071
A person whose wrists
were first bound...

34:33.105 --> 34:34.739
with a leather belt.

34:36.208 --> 34:39.311
A devout Vaishnava would
never even touch such an item.

34:39.344 --> 34:40.379
BELL:
Back in India,

34:40.411 --> 34:41.913
Jindal always used rope

34:41.947 --> 34:43.882
or fabric
to tie his victim's wrists.

34:43.915 --> 34:47.386
All right, maybe he went
with something that was on hand.

34:47.418 --> 34:49.188
Maybe one of the victim's belts.

34:49.221 --> 34:51.623
A possibility I considered
until I looked at the size.

34:51.657 --> 34:53.091
It's too large to have

34:53.125 --> 34:54.860
belonged to Mr. Garza.

34:54.893 --> 34:55.960
I think the killer
brought it with him

34:55.994 --> 34:57.229
as he did the drill
for his skull.

34:57.263 --> 34:58.264
Okay, say you're right.

34:58.297 --> 34:59.431
Where does this leave us?

34:59.465 --> 35:00.899
BELL: Jindal's
attorney sent us

35:00.932 --> 35:03.669
paperwork that seems
to support his story.

35:03.702 --> 35:05.204
Topaz Valley Industries

35:05.237 --> 35:08.039
asked for and received a permit
to extract the sand

35:08.073 --> 35:09.975
in the vicinity
of the Maracott Bridge.

35:10.008 --> 35:11.477
HOLMES: However,
when I compared them

35:11.510 --> 35:12.878
to samples of handwriting

35:12.911 --> 35:15.481
found at Mr. Garza's home,
it was obvious

35:15.514 --> 35:17.149
they were not a match
for the signatures

35:17.183 --> 35:18.584
that we received on the paper.

35:18.617 --> 35:19.885
Okay.

35:19.918 --> 35:22.188
So the Sand Mafia
forged the paperwork.

35:22.221 --> 35:23.955
Well, that's another
possibility,

35:23.989 --> 35:25.724
but why would they
kill someone so brazenly?

35:25.757 --> 35:27.959
Why not just dispose of the body
where we would never find it?

35:27.993 --> 35:29.661
Okay, say you're right.

35:29.695 --> 35:31.663
The Sand Mafia
didn't forge the paperwork,

35:31.697 --> 35:33.165
and they didn't kill
Romeo Garza.

35:33.199 --> 35:34.900
Who did?
And why did they want

35:34.933 --> 35:37.002
Topaz Valley to think
their sand mining

35:37.035 --> 35:38.304
wouldn't affect
the Maracott Bridge?

35:42.408 --> 35:44.009
What?

35:44.042 --> 35:45.811
If the Sand Mafia
didn't kill this man

35:45.844 --> 35:47.012
and they didn't

35:47.045 --> 35:47.913
forge the signatures,

35:47.946 --> 35:50.115
what else didn't they do?

35:51.116 --> 35:52.384
PICKERING:
This is horrible.

35:52.418 --> 35:54.286
Romeo was a wonderful man.

35:54.320 --> 35:56.522
You say this is connected
to the work done

35:56.555 --> 35:58.690
by Topaz Valley Industries.

35:58.724 --> 36:00.392
You think it might
be the same man

36:00.426 --> 36:02.728
that threatened to kill me if
I didn't approve their permit?

36:02.761 --> 36:05.063
We would have thought
it was the same man...

36:05.096 --> 36:07.499
if that man actually existed.

36:07.533 --> 36:09.000
What?

36:09.034 --> 36:10.702
HOLMES: Last night,
after Mr. Garza was killed,

36:10.736 --> 36:13.539
it seemed easier to come up
with reasons that the people

36:13.572 --> 36:16.007
behind Topaz Valley Industries
wouldn't have done it

36:16.041 --> 36:17.576
than reasons
that they would.

36:17.609 --> 36:19.144
I wondered, if they didn't
forge his signature

36:19.177 --> 36:21.079
on the report that we received

36:21.112 --> 36:23.782
and they didn't murder him,
perhaps, despite the story

36:23.815 --> 36:25.050
that you told
my partner,

36:25.083 --> 36:26.952
they didn't put a gun
to your head, either.

36:26.985 --> 36:29.421
Why would I make up
something like that?
BELL: Probably because

36:29.455 --> 36:31.056
you didn't want us
to realize how many

36:31.089 --> 36:32.258
different crimes
you had committed.

36:32.291 --> 36:34.059
GREGSON: Let's start
with the first.

36:34.092 --> 36:35.794
We talked to some
of your colleagues

36:35.827 --> 36:37.463
at, uh, your company
this morning,

36:37.496 --> 36:40.599
and they shared with us a
rumor that you get kickbacks

36:40.632 --> 36:42.968
from a company called
Siwanoy Concrete.

36:43.001 --> 36:44.936
What?
I thought it was
strange how often

36:44.970 --> 36:46.972
you accepted
Siwanoy's bids for

36:47.005 --> 36:48.574
construction jobs
around the county,

36:48.607 --> 36:50.576
especially when
there were

36:50.609 --> 36:52.344
competing bids
that were lower.

36:52.378 --> 36:53.979
HOLMES:
One wonders

36:54.012 --> 36:55.781
how much of a windfall
you would receive

36:55.814 --> 36:58.016
for the reconstruction
of a collapsed bridge.

36:58.049 --> 37:00.085
Now, hold on just a second here.

37:00.118 --> 37:01.420
We think that when
you received

37:01.453 --> 37:02.921
the permit request
from Topaz Valley

37:02.954 --> 37:04.956
to siphon sand near
the Maracott Bridge,

37:04.990 --> 37:06.392
you looked into them.

37:06.425 --> 37:08.126
Eventually, you realized
that it was a front

37:08.159 --> 37:09.461
for Vikrant Jindal
and his men.

37:09.495 --> 37:10.762
HOLMES:
More importantly,

37:10.796 --> 37:12.631
you realized
that if they actually

37:12.664 --> 37:14.533
carried out the work
they were proposing,

37:14.566 --> 37:16.535
there was an excellent chance
that over time

37:16.568 --> 37:18.136
that bridge would collapse.

37:18.169 --> 37:20.939
So you forged a report
saying the exact opposite,

37:20.972 --> 37:23.041
and then you signed
Romeo's name to it.

37:23.074 --> 37:24.443
BELL:
Lauren Wexler realized

37:24.476 --> 37:26.244
the bridge was in danger, right?

37:26.278 --> 37:27.979
That day she came
to your offices,

37:28.013 --> 37:30.716
she tried to warn you,
so you killed her.

37:30.749 --> 37:33.018
You knew that if we talked
to Vikrant Jindal,

37:33.051 --> 37:36.121
he would give us the report
that had Romeo's name on it.

37:36.154 --> 37:39.057
Then Romeo would tell us that he
didn't write a word of it.

37:39.090 --> 37:40.692
GREGSON:
So you killed him, too.

37:40.726 --> 37:42.894
Made it look like it
was Jindal's people

37:42.928 --> 37:44.763
so we would go after
them and not you.

37:44.796 --> 37:48.133
I think I'd like to talk
to my lawyer now.

37:48.166 --> 37:50.035
Sure. No problem.

37:50.068 --> 37:53.672
When he gets here,
we can show him this.

37:53.705 --> 37:55.874
A warrant to
search your car.

37:55.907 --> 37:57.743
We're especially interested
in your seat belts.

37:57.776 --> 38:00.045
We know that Lauren Wexler
was strangled with one

38:00.078 --> 38:02.481
from a late-model
Japanese sedan.

38:02.514 --> 38:04.516
You drive a 2014 Nissan Altima,
don't you?

38:04.550 --> 38:07.353
GREGSON: We appreciate you
driving it here, by the way.

38:07.386 --> 38:09.555
Saved CSU a lot of time.

38:09.588 --> 38:11.623
By now,
they've probably

38:11.657 --> 38:14.926
finished taking swabs
for Ms. Wexler's

38:14.960 --> 38:16.628
skin cells and saliva.

38:16.662 --> 38:19.865
Detective Bell is going to
read you your rights now.

38:22.968 --> 38:25.136
Kelsey, your rideshare is here.

38:25.170 --> 38:27.005
KELSEY:
Be right down.

38:29.575 --> 38:31.042
You okay?

38:32.844 --> 38:35.514
Yeah, it's just hormones.

38:35.547 --> 38:37.215
Here you go.

38:37.248 --> 38:39.250
Thank you.

38:41.219 --> 38:42.421
I'm sorry.

38:42.454 --> 38:44.356
Uh, that was a lie.

38:44.390 --> 38:46.224
I can't give you my baby.

38:47.893 --> 38:49.961
Okay.

38:49.995 --> 38:51.997
I mean, I knew there
were no guarantees.

38:52.030 --> 38:54.032
You're meeting
with other parents.

38:54.065 --> 38:55.233
Maybe you'll find
the right match.

38:55.266 --> 38:56.968
No, no. I-I'm sorry.

38:57.002 --> 38:59.170
It's just...
I should have been more clear.

38:59.204 --> 39:01.673
I can't give you
my baby, because...

39:02.774 --> 39:04.175
I'm keeping it.

39:05.911 --> 39:08.714
I'm not visiting
with any other parents.

39:08.747 --> 39:11.016
I'm going back
to Philadelphia.

39:14.986 --> 39:16.054
It's okay.

39:16.087 --> 39:17.255
Come here. Sit down.

39:17.288 --> 39:19.124
I-I'll cancel your ride.

39:25.196 --> 39:27.833
I'm sorry.
I know this is crazy.

39:28.867 --> 39:30.602
No, it is not crazy.

39:30.636 --> 39:32.838
It's your baby.

39:36.007 --> 39:38.410
You know this is all
your fault, right?

39:39.678 --> 39:42.013
I've never met
anyone like you.

39:42.047 --> 39:43.749
Like, it's inspiring.

39:48.053 --> 39:50.388
Until I got pregnant,

39:50.422 --> 39:53.592
I could have told you exactly
what the next 20 years

39:53.625 --> 39:55.326
of my life looked like.

39:56.695 --> 39:59.164
You know, like,
I was on a track.

39:59.197 --> 40:02.100
Then I peed on a stick
one morning,

40:02.133 --> 40:04.636
and all of a sudden,

40:04.670 --> 40:06.071
I wasn't just off the track.

40:06.104 --> 40:08.474
I mean, the track was gone.

40:08.507 --> 40:11.977
And giving up the baby
was supposed to fix all of that.

40:14.345 --> 40:17.749
Then I spent a couple of days
here with you, and...

40:19.685 --> 40:22.220
I don't know,
it got me thinking,

40:22.253 --> 40:25.256
"Why can't I do
everything I ever wanted

40:25.290 --> 40:27.292
and be a mom?"

40:28.727 --> 40:31.463
It-it sounds so
lame when I say it.

40:31.497 --> 40:36.001
But then Sherlock came
to talk to me last night,

40:36.034 --> 40:38.436
and he told me
that you can do anything.

40:38.470 --> 40:41.707
And I believe him.

40:43.709 --> 40:46.177
I don't know,
I guess I just want people

40:46.211 --> 40:48.113
to say the same thing about me.

40:50.281 --> 40:53.084
I want my son to
be able to say it.

40:57.055 --> 40:58.423
He's kicking.

40:59.825 --> 41:02.060
(chuckles)
He's probably saying,

41:02.093 --> 41:05.130
"You're crazy. Let me
stay here with Joan."

41:05.931 --> 41:07.465
No.

41:10.001 --> 41:12.170
He's probably
just really happy.

41:14.906 --> 41:16.708
You should be, too.

41:19.210 --> 41:21.012
Do you want to feel it?

41:21.947 --> 41:24.115
(both chuckle quietly)

41:27.919 --> 41:30.021
(chuckles)

41:30.055 --> 41:31.256
MAN (over TV):
How long have you known?

41:31.289 --> 41:32.357
WOMAN (over TV):
Since that day at the gala.

41:32.390 --> 41:33.992
I've never understood

41:34.025 --> 41:35.594
the idea that a
sad motion picture

41:35.627 --> 41:38.096
could be helpful
to a sad person.

41:38.129 --> 41:39.130
You don't have
to understand it.

41:39.164 --> 41:40.899
You just have to watch it.

41:40.932 --> 41:43.702
She isn't wrong, you know.

41:43.735 --> 41:45.837
Kelsey.

41:47.806 --> 41:49.775
You are inspiring.

41:51.176 --> 41:53.344
To the right person.

41:53.378 --> 41:56.481
I guess I'll have
to work on that.

continues indistinctly)
