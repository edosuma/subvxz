"Gossip Girl" here

00:04.047 --> 00:05.440
into the scandalous lives
of Manhattan's elite.

00:05.527 --> 00:07.964
Andre Leon Talley is raving
about the finale dress

00:08.051 --> 00:09.270
- 'He loved it.'
- My dress?

00:09.357 --> 00:10.880
Is that what you told
Headmistress Queller

00:10.967 --> 00:12.099
that you don't care about
all the school you've missed?

00:12.186 --> 00:13.796
I told her I'm not
coming back.

00:13.883 --> 00:14.840
I tried to write, but there was
something in the way.

00:14.927 --> 00:16.277
I couldn't focus.

00:16.364 --> 00:18.409
You'll get no letter
of recommendation from me.

00:18.496 --> 00:20.759
[Eleanor]
The captain is being charged
with embezzlement and fraud.

00:20.846 --> 00:22.413
[female #1]
'This is an absolute disaster.'

00:22.500 --> 00:24.589
Serena is in
"Women's Wear Daily."

00:24.676 --> 00:26.591
I'm just tired of trying
to hold myself back

00:26.678 --> 00:27.853
so I don't outshine you.

00:27.940 --> 00:29.551
Excuse me?

00:29.638 --> 00:31.248
[Serena]
From now on,
I'm gonna be who I am.

00:32.728 --> 00:33.946
[theme music]

00:34.034 --> 00:35.557
And who am I

00:35.644 --> 00:37.602
That's a secret
I'll never tell

00:39.213 --> 00:40.910
You know you love me

00:40.997 --> 00:42.085
XOXO.

"The rain in Spain"

00:56.491 --> 01:00.886
"stays mainly

01:00.973 --> 01:02.062
Again.

01:03.759 --> 01:06.544

01:06.631 --> 01:09.417

01:10.548 --> 01:14.813

01:14.900 --> 01:16.163
[sighs]

01:16.250 --> 01:19.035
Well, I'm a straight "A"
student, I am.

01:19.122 --> 01:20.167
[gasps]

01:20.254 --> 01:23.474

The rain in Spain
stays mainly in the plain.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.220
By George,
I think she's got it.

01:30.307 --> 01:31.439
I do?

01:32.831 --> 01:34.746
No.

01:34.833 --> 01:36.008
She does.

01:37.662 --> 01:40.012
[laughing]

01:41.536 --> 01:43.799
Oh!

01:43.886 --> 01:46.541
[crying]

01:54.201 --> 01:58.118
We all have dreams
some good, some bad

01:58.205 --> 02:00.424
some fun and Freudian.

02:00.511 --> 02:02.252
Morning, Miss Blair.

02:02.339 --> 02:05.299
And some are the dreams
we've had our whole lives.

02:05.386 --> 02:08.519
Dorota, can you believe
that in just three short hours

02:08.606 --> 02:10.217
I'll be stepping through
the gates of Yale?

02:10.304 --> 02:12.349
You used to sleep
in your father's sweatshirt

02:12.436 --> 02:14.351
every night
until it fell apart.

02:14.438 --> 02:16.353
I'll get a new one,
right after I attend

02:16.440 --> 02:18.747
the dean of admissions
private reception, of course.

02:18.834 --> 02:20.575
'Most candidates think
it's an urban legend'

02:20.662 --> 02:22.054
'but daddy was invited
when he visited.'

02:22.142 --> 02:23.621
Your mother already
left for work

02:23.708 --> 02:26.102
but she was very specific
about your breakfast.

02:26.189 --> 02:28.148
Somekombucha, Miss Blair?

02:28.235 --> 02:29.671
Since the dean
handpicks the guests

02:29.758 --> 02:32.717
right after their interviews,
I'm a shoo-in.

02:32.804 --> 02:35.633
If there's one thing I know,
it's that I give good interview.

02:35.720 --> 02:37.331
I could make
Larry King cry.

02:40.856 --> 02:42.205
I am so proud of you.

02:43.902 --> 02:46.514
And I'm so ready
to be surrounded by people

02:46.601 --> 02:48.124
more like me and less like..

02:50.039 --> 02:51.997
...her.

02:52.084 --> 02:53.999
'Oh, you've gotta
be kidding me.'

02:56.306 --> 02:57.612
[Lilly]
'Ready?'

02:57.699 --> 03:00.267
[Serena]
Oh, yeah.
Um, I'm all packed up.'

03:00.354 --> 03:02.138
You excited,
me at your Alma Mater?

03:02.225 --> 03:04.009
So I guess that means
you turned down this, uh

03:04.096 --> 03:05.750
personal invitation
to tour Yale?

03:05.837 --> 03:08.013
Brown's always been my plan,
just like it was for you.

03:08.100 --> 03:11.713
And I loved it there,
but if Yale had invited me

03:11.800 --> 03:13.280
I would have said yes.

03:13.367 --> 03:16.805
The, uh, invitation is
handwritten, Serena, in cursive.

03:18.502 --> 03:20.635
Yale is for
overachieving bookworms

03:20.722 --> 03:23.159
and preppies,
the Blairs of the world.

03:23.246 --> 03:25.596
Even though the two of us aren't
exactly on speaking terms

03:25.683 --> 03:28.295
there's no way I would step
on that particular land mine.

03:28.382 --> 03:30.906
Miss Serena and you're
still not speaking?

03:30.993 --> 03:33.561
Not a word in a week, though
I can't seem to escape her.

03:33.648 --> 03:34.953
Ever since my mother's show

03:35.040 --> 03:36.477
Manhattan has turned
into Serena Ville.

03:36.564 --> 03:39.610
I heard "Marc Jacobs"
named a purse after her.

03:39.697 --> 03:41.133
[chuckles]

03:43.832 --> 03:47.227
Well, Isimply don't understand
the fascination.

03:47.314 --> 03:50.055
[sighs]
Fortunately, Yale
is out of her reach.

03:50.142 --> 03:52.362
It's okay, Serena. You don't
have to hide the photo.

03:52.449 --> 03:54.016
I've seen it.

03:54.103 --> 03:56.061
I'm sorry they called
you my unidentified friend.

03:56.148 --> 03:57.367
Well, I guess it's better
than "mother."

03:57.454 --> 03:59.021
What's in the bag?

03:59.108 --> 04:00.805
'It's my dress for the fall
dinner at the frick.'

04:00.892 --> 04:05.245
Eleanor sent them over.
I don't know why there's two.

04:05.332 --> 04:07.943
This one's a little edgier
than I thought, but I like it.

04:08.030 --> 04:10.206
Apparently it's for me.

04:11.642 --> 04:13.209
[laughs]

04:13.296 --> 04:16.343
Oh, this must be mine.

04:16.430 --> 04:18.083
[Serena]
'It is a really
nice color, though.'

04:18.170 --> 04:19.563
[Dan]
'Dad, what do you think
of this color?'

04:19.650 --> 04:21.739
- Of the paper? It's white.
- No, no, no.

04:21.826 --> 04:24.481
It's not white. It's soft ecru.
This is, that's white.

04:24.568 --> 04:26.614
I like the ecru myself
but I'm not sure about the font.

04:26.701 --> 04:28.224
Don't worry. You'll be fine.
More than fine.

04:28.311 --> 04:29.312
You're the perfect
Yale candidate.

04:29.399 --> 04:30.661
Maybe, but I-I can't
help thinking

04:30.748 --> 04:32.837
that Yale is for Presidents,
not Humphreys.

04:32.924 --> 04:34.709
As the man who cursed
you with the Humphrey Moniker...

04:34.796 --> 04:36.319
I didn't say "cursed."
"cursed" would be cruel.

04:36.406 --> 04:37.886
I now feel compelled
to give a speech.

04:37.973 --> 04:40.715
Daniel, my son, you have
near perfect grades

04:40.802 --> 04:42.891
excellent SATS, more talent
than money could ever buy.

04:42.978 --> 04:45.763
- Yeah, but..
- After that, you find a "but"?

04:45.850 --> 04:47.243
What if it's not enough?

04:47.330 --> 04:48.636
If that's not enough,
then there's something wrong

04:48.723 --> 04:50.855
with Yale, not you.

04:50.942 --> 04:52.857
Thanks, dad. Alright.

04:52.944 --> 04:54.555
Well, I'm, I'm off.

04:54.642 --> 04:56.774
It's just me, the best
English department in America

04:56.861 --> 04:58.689
and a hundred other
highly competitive

04:58.776 --> 05:00.343
extremely nervous,
wanna be Yalies.

05:00.430 --> 05:02.084
Get excited, Archibald.

05:02.171 --> 05:03.694
We are three hours away

05:03.781 --> 05:05.479
from horny women's
studies majors

05:05.566 --> 05:09.047
wanting to work out
all their anger towards men

05:09.134 --> 05:10.310
in their bunk beds.

05:10.397 --> 05:12.616
My heart's still
set on USC.

05:12.703 --> 05:14.879
I-I just wish my mom
wouldn't push Yale so hard.

05:14.966 --> 05:16.620
I think she's only pushing it
'cause the Vanderbilt side

05:16.707 --> 05:18.274
of her family
practically owns it.

05:18.361 --> 05:21.930
Think of it this way.
Yale is your safety school.

05:22.017 --> 05:23.845
I guess I could
get away from all the drama

05:23.932 --> 05:25.890
on the other side
of my family.

05:25.977 --> 05:27.762
And go someplace where they
don't know me or the captain.

05:27.849 --> 05:29.372
We blow off
the formal visit crap

05:29.459 --> 05:31.331
and focus
on what really matters.

05:31.418 --> 05:33.811
Creating your own
freshman 15.

05:33.898 --> 05:35.552
You're not seriously considering
going to Yale either?

05:35.639 --> 05:39.817
I'm, uh, evaluating colleges
based on secret societies.

05:39.904 --> 05:42.777
Yale has the creme de la creme,
the skull and bones.

05:42.864 --> 05:45.040
My goal is to get inside
their inner sanctum.

05:45.127 --> 05:46.955
And how exactly are
you planning to do that?

05:48.173 --> 05:49.914
By showing up.

05:50.001 --> 05:52.177
[Prescott]
'This weekend concludes
college visits.'

05:52.264 --> 05:53.831
The schools
you will be visiting

05:53.918 --> 05:57.313
Harvard, Yale and Brown
are among the best in the world.

05:57.400 --> 05:59.184
[Prescott]
'You are ambassadors'

05:59.271 --> 06:01.273
'of Constance Billard
and St. Jude's'

06:01.361 --> 06:02.840
'as well as your own families.'

06:02.927 --> 06:04.581
'We urge you to present'

06:04.668 --> 06:07.628
'yourselves in the best
possible light. Good luck.'

06:07.715 --> 06:09.194
I wonder what lucky school

06:09.281 --> 06:11.371
will be the subject
of the next nursery rhyme

06:11.458 --> 06:14.069
penned by Brooklyn's
lamest fiction writer?

06:14.156 --> 06:15.897
Actually, Chuck, I think
the dean of admissions at Yale

06:15.984 --> 06:17.855
will actually appreciate
my ability to write about

06:17.942 --> 06:19.509
uh, damaged characters.

06:19.596 --> 06:21.206
Looks like we'll be spending
the weekend together.

06:21.293 --> 06:23.121
How nice.

06:23.208 --> 06:27.256
Say hello to the characters on
public transportation for me.

06:27.343 --> 06:28.518
Hey.

06:28.605 --> 06:30.390
So you're off to Yale?

06:30.477 --> 06:32.217
Your deductive reasoning
skills are perfect

06:32.304 --> 06:33.305
for a place like Brown.

06:33.393 --> 06:34.916
A place like Brown?

06:35.003 --> 06:38.310
An enclave of trustafarians
and children of celebrities

06:38.398 --> 06:41.270
who major in drum circles
and semiotics

06:41.357 --> 06:43.838
whatever that is. I can't wait
for you to come home

06:43.925 --> 06:47.232
next thanksgiving a militant
veganista, anemic and proud.

06:47.319 --> 06:49.365
Brown is an Ivy league school.

06:49.452 --> 06:51.367
Everyone knows
that the only real Ivies

06:51.454 --> 06:55.023
are the Holy Trinity,
Harvard, Yale and Princeton.

06:55.110 --> 06:56.894
I know you may find
this hard to believe

06:56.981 --> 06:58.548
but not everyone
wants to go to Yale

06:58.635 --> 07:00.768
because not everyone
wants to be Blair Waldorf.

07:00.855 --> 07:02.857
Not everyone canbe.

07:02.944 --> 07:06.208
Since we're not friends anymore,
let me speak frankly.

07:06.295 --> 07:09.429
You're not that smart.
You lack focus and discipline.

07:09.516 --> 07:11.605
Charm is all well
and good

07:11.692 --> 07:13.215
but in the real world,
knowledge is power.

07:13.302 --> 07:15.391
You wouldn't make it past
the first round of admissions

07:15.478 --> 07:17.437
at Yale, no matter
how hard you tried.

07:17.524 --> 07:19.482
Have fun in Providence.

07:19.569 --> 07:21.397
Oh, and you know,
maybe you can get

07:21.484 --> 07:23.747
your hair dreadlocked
while you're there.

07:23.834 --> 07:26.881
Gossip girl's hardly
a war buff, but I did cram

07:26.968 --> 07:29.623
for a quiz or two
on the American revolution.

07:29.710 --> 07:33.148
The last time New Haven
was invaded was in 1779.

07:34.410 --> 07:36.673
Hey, mom. Change of plans.

07:36.760 --> 07:38.458
Tell the driver
we're going to Yale.

07:38.545 --> 07:39.981
Heads up, B.

07:40.068 --> 07:42.070
There's a cannonball
coming your way.

07:45.726 --> 07:47.554
[instrumental music]

07:55.953 --> 07:57.520
Oh, after that shower

07:57.607 --> 07:59.000
there won't be any hot water
left in the building.

07:59.087 --> 08:00.349
I wasn't in the shower
the whole time.

08:00.436 --> 08:01.872
I was waiting for something.

08:01.959 --> 08:03.700
Ah, I got here
as fast as I could.

08:03.787 --> 08:06.355
I know. I, uh, saw you running
up the block from my window.

08:06.442 --> 08:07.965
What's going on here?

08:08.052 --> 08:10.272
Did you know that Vanessa's
applying for NYU next fall?

08:10.359 --> 08:11.491
Something you wouldn't
be able to do

08:11.578 --> 08:12.666
without finishing
high school.

08:12.753 --> 08:15.407
Which she's doing
by homeschooling.

08:15.495 --> 08:17.322
Which she has to do because she
has to work to support herself.

08:17.409 --> 08:19.107
'Living as an adult
when you're a teenager'

08:19.194 --> 08:20.891
is not something any parent
wants for their child.

08:20.978 --> 08:22.240
Well, what about
what I want for me?

08:22.327 --> 08:23.894
Well, until you're 18,
what you want

08:23.981 --> 08:25.330
gets trumped
by what I want.

08:27.594 --> 08:28.682
Plan "B."

08:30.597 --> 08:32.120
[sighs]

08:32.207 --> 08:33.382
Come to the Atelier
with me today.

08:33.469 --> 08:34.862
- Come with you?
- I'll make you a deal.

08:34.949 --> 08:36.428
Spend the day with me,
and by the end of the day

08:36.516 --> 08:37.778
if you honestly think
that I should go back

08:37.865 --> 08:39.475
to Constance on Monday,
I will.

08:39.562 --> 08:41.085
Jenny, I've seen
all your designs

08:41.172 --> 08:43.566
'heard about your internship
all summer long.'

08:43.653 --> 08:44.915
What more is there?

08:45.002 --> 08:46.482
Well, things
are different now.

08:51.574 --> 08:54.534
Well, at least we'll be moving
forward in one way or another.

08:54.621 --> 08:56.231
- It's a deal.
- You mean it?

08:56.318 --> 08:59.451
- You have my word.
- Thank you!

08:59.539 --> 09:02.542
We hear there's nothing
like Yale in October.

09:02.629 --> 09:04.848

09:11.246 --> 09:15.555

that I have something to say.

'Well, by all means, say it.'

09:16.860 --> 09:18.383

09:18.470 --> 09:20.211
Uh, with-with its
world class English department

09:20.298 --> 09:22.953
Yale would be the ideal place
for me to grow

09:23.040 --> 09:25.521
as, a-as a writer,
to, to flourish

09:25.608 --> 09:27.523
and, uh, thrive.

09:27.610 --> 09:30.091
Kudos to you and your
inner thesaurus Mr. Humphrey

09:30.178 --> 09:32.049
but there's a problem
with your application.

09:32.136 --> 09:34.922
A-a-a pr-no, there's um,
I double, I triple-checked it.

09:35.009 --> 09:36.967
It seems you only have
one letter of recommendation

09:37.054 --> 09:38.621
from J. L. Hall.

09:38.708 --> 09:41.668
Noah Shapiro declined
to write on your behalf.

09:41.755 --> 09:44.496
Um, Mr. Shapiro and I
had creative differences

09:44.584 --> 09:46.455
but, but if you look
further down my application

09:46.542 --> 09:47.630
you'll see
that I spent the summer

09:47.717 --> 09:49.110
interning with
Jeremiah Harris.

09:49.197 --> 09:50.546
A fact which Mr. Harris

09:50.633 --> 09:54.028
has not been able
to confirm himself.

09:54.115 --> 09:57.205
Oh, um, did you, did you
call him early in the morning?

09:57.292 --> 09:59.642
Cause he's not,
he's not a morning person.

09:59.729 --> 10:00.687
I mean, he's not
an afternoon person either.

10:00.774 --> 10:02.471
If you try, like,
after seven--

10:02.558 --> 10:06.214
Mr. Humphrey, if you want
your application to stand out

10:06.301 --> 10:09.652
you need another letter,
one about your work.

10:09.739 --> 10:12.263
Another letter
from whom and how?

10:12.350 --> 10:14.091

'This is Yale.'

gonna do something.'

to your master plan

10:32.893 --> 10:35.156
You don't find them.

10:35.243 --> 10:36.418
They find you.

10:36.505 --> 10:37.854
Hm. That's good.

10:37.941 --> 10:39.377
So we'll just
sit here and wait.

10:41.205 --> 10:42.816
I mean, there's
a football game at 1:00

10:42.903 --> 10:46.515

Art Gallery at 3:00.

you can mix up with electives.

- Mm-hmm.
- Well, what's your favorite?

12:08.902 --> 12:12.209

the role of sex in art

But before I go

12:39.454 --> 12:42.022
I think maybe you should
tell me your name.

your application

There's just one thing
I'd like to know.

Tell me something about

She was recently
in a fashion show just for fun.

I know I must seem
rather traditional

13:59.273 --> 14:00.970
compared to that young lady

14:01.057 --> 14:03.799
but isn't tradition
what Yale is all about?

Well, yes, but we've been
trying to change that image.

I lack some

- Just.

something this morning, but..

keep it. I need your help.

can wait till she's ready.

started to come true?

17:55.335 --> 17:56.945

told them to wait?

Just make sure
they're up for anything.

18:02.646 --> 18:04.387

can get particular.

18:14.658 --> 18:16.225
I've been invited
to the dean's house tonight.

18:16.312 --> 18:18.009
- I have to get ready.

to his question?

to have dinner with?

The rumor is, if your answer
impresses the dean enough

18:31.153 --> 18:33.024
it's gets you on the short list
for early admission

even know that?

want to go to dinner

18:57.223 --> 18:58.354

And I know this because
talking with Blair

19:06.884 --> 19:08.843
about how she's going to get

'Blair, that's enough.
Let's go.'

29:10.357 --> 29:12.707
Dean Berube,
do you mind if we um

29:12.794 --> 29:14.143
sort this out
privately, please?

29:14.230 --> 29:16.102
Take all the time you need.

29:16.189 --> 29:21.194
My answer was George Sand.
Love her, idolize, worship!

29:21.281 --> 29:24.153
Get your hands off of me! Or are
you trying to kill me, too?

29:24.240 --> 29:25.981
A guy died, and you use it
as part of a game.

29:26.068 --> 29:27.766
- Who does that?
- It isn't a game.

29:27.853 --> 29:29.811
And this isn't just another
thing on a laundry list.

29:29.898 --> 29:32.335
This is Yale, my dream.
You crossed the line.

29:32.422 --> 29:34.511
And so did you
when you brought up Pete!

29:34.598 --> 29:36.775
As far as my being here, you
take that up with the school.

29:39.647 --> 29:40.779
[thud]

29:43.520 --> 29:44.826
You did not just do that.

29:44.913 --> 29:46.567
Why did you think
you were invited?

29:46.654 --> 29:48.264
'You know on paper
you're not Yale material.'

29:48.351 --> 29:49.788
Could it be your face
on "page six?"

29:49.875 --> 29:52.268
Your name everywhere?
Face it, Serena.

29:52.355 --> 29:53.835
Yale needs to up
their "Q" rating

29:53.922 --> 29:55.315
just like all the other schools
and they're gonna use

29:55.402 --> 29:56.533
girls like you
to do it.

29:57.491 --> 29:59.014
You shut up!

29:59.101 --> 30:00.189
You shut up!

30:01.538 --> 30:03.497
Ah! No!

30:03.584 --> 30:05.368
[grunts]
Blair!

30:05.455 --> 30:06.848
I really hate
that stupid headband.

30:06.935 --> 30:08.284
Ah! My headband!

30:08.371 --> 30:09.416
[Blair]
God!

30:10.547 --> 30:12.506
[grunting]
You, ah!

30:12.593 --> 30:14.377
No! You!

30:14.464 --> 30:16.162
Oh! Ah!

30:19.774 --> 30:22.603
[piano music]

30:27.608 --> 30:28.957
[elevator bell dings]

30:36.704 --> 30:39.141
Are you sure it's okay for us
to just come up here like this?

30:39.228 --> 30:40.360
Yeah. The maid's expecting me.

30:40.447 --> 30:41.622
Larissa?

30:43.363 --> 30:44.930
Whose maid
is Larissa exactly?

30:45.017 --> 30:46.366
You didn't say
where we were going.

30:48.585 --> 30:49.717
- Jenny?
- Lily's not here.

30:49.804 --> 30:51.066
I didn't think
you'd mind.

30:54.374 --> 30:55.549
Rufus.

30:56.855 --> 30:57.899
Whoa.

30:59.118 --> 31:00.206
[Lily]
Oh, um..

31:00.293 --> 31:02.121
[laughs]

31:02.208 --> 31:03.687
This is not my dress.

31:03.774 --> 31:07.517
I was just trying
it on for fun.

31:07.604 --> 31:10.085
Sorry, when I called,
um, Larissa said

31:10.172 --> 31:12.435
you're going out tonight,
and I could leave this with her.

31:12.522 --> 31:14.568
'I forgot to include it in the
garment bag with yourdress.'

31:14.655 --> 31:16.004
Oh.

31:16.091 --> 31:18.050
But...clearly

31:18.137 --> 31:20.095
um, I don't even think
you need it.

31:20.182 --> 31:22.054
'Uh, this dress
looks so great on you.'

31:25.971 --> 31:27.189
The only thing wrong
is the shoes.

31:27.276 --> 31:28.582
I can totally go
pick you out

31:28.669 --> 31:29.800
a different pair
if you want.

31:29.888 --> 31:31.715
Oh, upstairs,
third door on the left.

31:32.368 --> 31:33.413
Okay.

31:39.114 --> 31:41.725
- How have you been?
- Fine.

31:41.812 --> 31:44.511
- Sorry for the intrusion.
- Oh. It's no bother.

31:44.598 --> 31:45.816
I'm always happy to see you.

31:47.209 --> 31:48.254
Uh-ah..

31:48.341 --> 31:49.777
...the house seems quiet.

31:49.864 --> 31:52.084
Well, Bart is out of town

31:52.171 --> 31:54.173
Serena and Charles
are on college visits

31:54.260 --> 31:58.525
and Eric has a new friend,
so I hear.

31:58.612 --> 32:00.657
Well, the place looks amazing,
as do you.

32:00.744 --> 32:01.658
'It's quite a dress.'

32:01.745 --> 32:03.008
Of course it is.

32:04.661 --> 32:07.795
Your daughter made it.
You're so lucky

32:07.882 --> 32:10.015
to have a daughter
that's this good

32:10.102 --> 32:12.147
at what she wants to do
so early in her life.

32:13.583 --> 32:14.671
'It's a gift.'

32:16.456 --> 32:18.153
You had one, too,
if I remember correctly.

32:24.768 --> 32:26.335
Here you go.
The perfect pair of Jimmy Choos.

32:26.422 --> 32:29.251
Mm. I will lend these to Serena
when she wears the dress.

32:29.338 --> 32:31.166
- Okay.
- Jenny, we should get going.

32:31.253 --> 32:32.776
- Okay. See you.
- Bye.

32:36.432 --> 32:38.739
By the way

32:38.826 --> 32:40.219
no matter
what you wear

32:41.437 --> 32:42.699
you look fantastic.

32:44.788 --> 32:46.225
[elevator bell dings]

32:48.967 --> 32:50.533
Hey, man. Where are you?

32:50.620 --> 32:54.363
I've been sitting here forever.
Please, just call me back.

32:54.450 --> 32:56.844
- A round of shots, Mike.
- Coming right up, guys.

32:58.411 --> 33:00.108
We just taught Nate Archibald
a lesson

33:00.195 --> 33:01.980
'and he'll never
come back to Yale.'

33:02.067 --> 33:04.025
Yeah, Archibald's such a loser.

33:04.112 --> 33:06.288
Excuse me. Did you say
"Nate Archibald"?

33:06.375 --> 33:07.768
Yeah, we just tied
that chump

33:07.855 --> 33:10.205
to the statue in the gazebo.
It's priceless.

33:10.292 --> 33:11.424
I hope he freezes
his ass off.

33:11.511 --> 33:12.860
Well, you got
the wrong guy.

33:12.947 --> 33:14.079
I'mNate Archibald

33:15.602 --> 33:17.082
and I look forward
to coming here next year

33:17.169 --> 33:18.387
and kicking your ass.

33:18.474 --> 33:19.998
In fact, why wait?

33:20.085 --> 33:21.738
[groans]

33:21.825 --> 33:23.001
Okay, it can wait.

33:23.088 --> 33:25.438
[male #1]
'Go! Get him! Come on!'

33:26.656 --> 33:27.570
[male #2]
'Get him!'

33:27.657 --> 33:28.963
[grunts]

33:31.096 --> 33:33.272
Hey, excuse me.
Excuse me. Uh, hi.

33:33.359 --> 33:35.796
Um, I know this is a strange
request but could you untie me?

33:35.883 --> 33:38.842
Sir. Hey. Yeah.
Hey. Come on. Hey. Excuse me.

33:38.929 --> 33:41.584
Would you be so kind
as to, uh..

33:41.671 --> 33:42.977
[Nate]
'Dan?'

33:43.064 --> 33:45.240
[panting]

33:47.025 --> 33:49.375
Hope you at least bought
the statue a drink first.

33:49.462 --> 33:51.464
No, you know, I don't know
if I want you to help me.

33:51.551 --> 33:53.422
Well, you might, if you knew
that the only reason you're here

33:53.509 --> 33:55.033
is because they thought
you were me.

33:55.120 --> 33:57.774
How is that even possible?
I-I didn't lie about my name.

33:57.861 --> 34:00.081
Yeah, but I have a feeling
someone else did for you.

34:02.083 --> 34:05.260
Why would anyone want to hurt,
uh, Mr. Perfect Nate Archibald?

34:05.347 --> 34:06.696
Apparently my legacy at Yale

34:06.783 --> 34:09.003
involves a lot of people
hating my father's guts.

34:09.090 --> 34:11.527
It turns out he killed
a few trust funds around here.

34:11.614 --> 34:13.138
'By the way,
this knot is ridiculous.'

34:13.225 --> 34:14.400
Yeah, I know.

34:16.315 --> 34:18.447
Could you, uh, could you
try a little faster?

34:18.534 --> 34:21.755
'cause I see something
approaching that looks female.

34:21.842 --> 34:24.540
I'm not entirely proud
of my choice of boxers.

34:24.627 --> 34:25.933
You two again?

34:29.110 --> 34:31.547
- Yeah.
- Hi.

34:31.634 --> 34:33.158
Is this performance
art piece

34:33.245 --> 34:34.550
your new plan
to get my attention?

34:34.637 --> 34:37.031
Uh, wo-would-would it work
if it was?

34:37.118 --> 34:39.773
Move over.
My mom was in the navy.

34:39.860 --> 34:41.079
Oh, my God!

34:43.124 --> 34:45.474
[sighs]

34:45.561 --> 34:47.607
I can't do it
anymore, Blair.

34:47.694 --> 34:50.000
That's because
you almost lost.

34:50.088 --> 34:52.307
I had you pinned with that
chicken wing. Don't deny it.

34:52.394 --> 34:54.309
I don't mean this.
I mean everything.

34:56.137 --> 34:59.009
The wars, the betrayal,
the watching out

34:59.097 --> 35:01.490
for every
possible land mine.

35:01.577 --> 35:04.667
- It's exhausting.
- I'm sick of it, too.

35:04.754 --> 35:07.975
I'm sick of always
looking like Darth Vader

35:08.062 --> 35:10.369
next to Sunshine Barbie.

35:10.456 --> 35:11.500
'Life's too short.'

35:12.632 --> 35:14.024
You make it feel so long.

35:15.461 --> 35:16.766
Well, if that's how
we really feel

35:16.853 --> 35:19.247
may-maybe we shouldn't
be friends.

35:21.728 --> 35:24.209
'We were probably gonna
grow apart in college anyway'

35:24.296 --> 35:27.560
so we might as well
just start now, right?

35:29.649 --> 35:31.390
Fine by me.

35:31.477 --> 35:33.131
You live your life.
I'll live mine.

35:35.611 --> 35:37.613
Sounds great.

35:37.700 --> 35:38.919
I agree.

35:40.399 --> 35:42.923
[instrumental music]

35:47.841 --> 35:50.713
From comrades to combat,
we thought we'd seen it all

35:50.800 --> 35:52.585
but we've never seen this.

35:52.672 --> 35:55.588
Serena and Blair
calling a cease-fire.

35:55.675 --> 36:00.070
After so much scorched Earth,
can either side claim victory?

36:08.905 --> 36:10.559
Why do I feel like you're gonna
tell me the cat died?

36:10.646 --> 36:12.387
No, no. It's nothing bad.

36:12.474 --> 36:14.172
Uh, when I was your age

36:14.259 --> 36:15.695
all I wanted was
to be a musician

36:15.782 --> 36:17.914
but my parents didn't think
it was a good idea

36:18.001 --> 36:20.221
and it made for some
pretty uncomfortable years.

36:20.308 --> 36:22.571
And last night,
I realized that..

36:22.658 --> 36:25.183
...that we don't have
to do things that way.

36:25.270 --> 36:26.445
I don't understand.

36:26.532 --> 36:27.924
Your dad asked me
to bring over

36:28.011 --> 36:29.535
all my stuff
on homeschooling.

36:32.146 --> 36:33.452
[squealing]

36:33.539 --> 36:35.802
After Christmas,
we can re-evaluate.

36:35.889 --> 36:37.586
And if everything works out,
maybe you'll apply

36:37.673 --> 36:39.545
to the professional children
school for next semester.

36:39.632 --> 36:41.155
Like Vera Wang.

36:41.242 --> 36:42.330
Ah! Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

36:42.417 --> 36:43.549
Aw!

36:44.985 --> 36:46.726
I won't let you down.
I promise.

36:46.813 --> 36:48.031
I know you won't.

36:54.995 --> 36:56.910
What are you doing here?

36:56.997 --> 36:58.520
Making sure the dean knows
it's all my fault?

36:58.607 --> 37:00.566
No.

37:00.653 --> 37:02.698
I came to tell him
that Yale is your dream

37:02.785 --> 37:04.526
and you deserve to go here
more than I do.

37:06.049 --> 37:08.051
What are you
doing here?

37:08.138 --> 37:09.662
Doing the same thing
for you.

37:09.749 --> 37:12.665
[instrumental music]

37:12.752 --> 37:14.580
I was up all night
thinking about

37:14.667 --> 37:17.409
the first time we came here
together when we were nine.

37:17.496 --> 37:19.846
Your dad took us
to that Harvard/Yale game

37:19.933 --> 37:23.023
and you tackled
Senator Schumer's daughter

37:23.110 --> 37:24.459
for wearing
a Harvard sweatshirt.

37:24.546 --> 37:26.200
I bet those grass stains
never came out.

37:26.287 --> 37:27.723
[chuckles]

37:31.074 --> 37:32.250
I don't want
to not know you.

37:34.295 --> 37:35.253
I can't not know you.

37:36.602 --> 37:39.735
Maybe we just had
that fight because..

37:39.822 --> 37:41.998
...the reality of being
separated next year

37:42.085 --> 37:44.479
is just too scary
to think about.

37:48.135 --> 37:49.223
So?

37:53.009 --> 37:54.924
Wait here for me.

37:55.011 --> 37:57.144
We'll ride home together.

37:57.231 --> 37:58.276
Okay.

38:01.496 --> 38:04.630
So you think you can, uh,
maybe help him out a bit?

38:04.717 --> 38:06.371
Well, I can't
promise anything

38:06.458 --> 38:08.634
but...I'm pretty sure I can get
someone in the department--

38:08.721 --> 38:10.244
Oh!

38:10.331 --> 38:11.767
...to read these and write you
a recommendation.

38:11.854 --> 38:13.465
Yes. Thank you
so much, really.

38:13.552 --> 38:14.857
It's so nice to know that
my dream of going to Yale

38:14.944 --> 38:16.990
isn't dead.
It might be uh, embarrassed

38:17.077 --> 38:18.731
and humiliated,
but not dead.

38:18.818 --> 38:20.210
[chuckling]

38:20.298 --> 38:22.169
And I'm sorry
about lying to you.

38:22.256 --> 38:25.303
I just needed to be
someone else for a while.

38:25.390 --> 38:26.434
Yeah, well,
next time you're up here

38:26.521 --> 38:28.306
why don't you
just be yourself?

38:28.393 --> 38:29.698
- Okay.
- Yeah.

38:32.658 --> 38:34.442
I would have liked you
whatever your name was.

38:36.009 --> 38:37.576
- Bye, Dan.
- Bye.

38:38.620 --> 38:39.752
You know what,
you-you do

38:39.839 --> 38:41.623
Dan Humphrey better than
Dan Humphrey.

38:41.710 --> 38:43.103
That, uh, that thousand yard
squint, can I steal that?

38:43.190 --> 38:44.365
Well, thank you.

38:46.889 --> 38:48.326
[male #3]
'Here he is.'

38:50.458 --> 38:52.373
It looks like someone
messed up last night.

38:52.460 --> 38:53.853
You sent us
after the wrong guy.

38:53.940 --> 38:55.463
He may have been
the wrong guy for you

38:55.550 --> 38:56.856
but he was
the right guy for me.

38:56.943 --> 38:58.553
You'll pay for this
when you get here next year.

38:58.640 --> 39:00.555
Oh, I'm not coming here
next fall.

39:00.642 --> 39:02.905
Those girls I brought
to the party last night

39:02.992 --> 39:04.690
they witnessed some
pretty incriminating acts

39:04.777 --> 39:06.822
with their lipstick cameras.

39:06.909 --> 39:08.171
You may be the future
leaders of America..

39:08.258 --> 39:09.608
[camera shutters clicking]

39:09.695 --> 39:12.132
...you're now under
the control of Chuck Bass.

39:12.219 --> 39:13.220
I own you.

39:13.307 --> 39:14.961
[camera shutters clicking]

39:16.354 --> 39:17.529
Keep it.

39:17.616 --> 39:18.921
'I've got plenty.'

39:27.539 --> 39:28.757
Missed you last night.

39:29.845 --> 39:31.238
Did you?

39:31.325 --> 39:33.066
Or was it your plan
all along

39:33.153 --> 39:34.763
just to get me
out of the way?

39:34.850 --> 39:36.461
- What?
- I know what you did.

39:39.289 --> 39:40.943
You should be glad.
Those guys were coming for you.

39:41.030 --> 39:42.249
I saved your ass.

39:42.336 --> 39:43.685
You didn't have
to send them after Dan.

39:43.772 --> 39:45.557
Two birds, one stone.
Seemed good to me.

39:45.644 --> 39:48.342
Besides, since when do you care
about Humdrum Humphrey anyway?

39:48.429 --> 39:50.388
He's nothing.

39:50.475 --> 39:51.737
He's less than nothing.

39:51.824 --> 39:53.434
I actually think
he's pretty cool.

39:53.521 --> 39:55.044
We'll talk about this
in the car.

39:55.131 --> 39:57.264
No, I think, ah, I think
I'd rather take the train.

40:01.834 --> 40:03.705
So the dean seemed
inscrutable to you, too?

40:03.792 --> 40:05.490
I don't think
he even blinked.

40:05.577 --> 40:07.796
Well, since we're probably
both gonna end up at Hunter

40:07.883 --> 40:10.669
after what happened, I think we
ought to say a proper goodbye.

40:12.714 --> 40:14.063
[cellphone ringing]

40:14.150 --> 40:15.500
Hello?

40:15.587 --> 40:17.284
[Berube on phone]
Serena, Dean Berube.

40:17.371 --> 40:18.938
Oh, hello, sir.

40:19.025 --> 40:21.375
I just thought you should
know that despite events

40:21.462 --> 40:24.422
at last night's reception,
I-I remain..

40:24.509 --> 40:26.554
...most impressed
with you

40:26.641 --> 40:29.383
[Berube on phone]
'and come time for
early acceptances in December'

40:29.470 --> 40:31.907
'I'd check that list to see
if your name was on it.'

40:31.994 --> 40:33.996
Okay, but what about Blair?

40:34.083 --> 40:35.650
[Berube on phone]
'Well, like all
the other students'

40:35.737 --> 40:36.999
'with Blair's qualifications'

40:37.086 --> 40:38.827
'she will learn her fate
in the spring.'

40:38.914 --> 40:40.133
'And if it's alright with you'

40:40.220 --> 40:41.700
I'd like to issue
a press release

40:41.787 --> 40:44.529
that you came up to visit
our glorious campus.

40:46.095 --> 40:47.445
I'm gonna have
to call you back.

40:50.883 --> 40:53.102
I won't accept.
I can't, like this.

40:53.189 --> 40:55.365
What? No, you have to.

40:55.453 --> 40:57.977
It doesn't matter
how you got it or why.

40:58.064 --> 40:59.848
- It's an opportunity.
- No, you're my best friend.

40:59.935 --> 41:00.849
What's mine is yours.

41:02.372 --> 41:03.809
You can't share this.

41:05.854 --> 41:07.465
We'll find a way..

41:07.552 --> 41:08.683
...together.

41:12.165 --> 41:14.907
Dreams, everybody has them.

41:14.994 --> 41:17.605
Some good, some bad

41:17.692 --> 41:19.433
some you wish
you could forget.

41:21.566 --> 41:24.351
Sometimes you realize
you've outgrown them.

41:26.353 --> 41:29.443
Sometimes you feel like
they're finally coming true..

41:33.969 --> 41:37.277
...and some of us
just have nightmares.

41:37.364 --> 41:40.106
[indistinct chattering]

41:42.412 --> 41:44.371
But no matter
what you dream

41:44.458 --> 41:47.592
when morning comes,
reality intrudes

41:47.679 --> 41:49.724
and the dream begins
to slip away.

41:52.422 --> 41:54.729
Dream a little dream of me.

41:54.816 --> 41:56.992
XOXO, gossip girl.

42:00.518 --> 42:02.868
