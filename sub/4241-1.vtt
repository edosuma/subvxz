WEBVTT

00:01.507 --> 00:03.008
<i>So, here's what you missed
last season on</i> Glee.

00:03.076 --> 00:05.043
<i>Quinn had a baby,
Finn and Rachel are in love,</i>

00:05.111 --> 00:06.979
<i>Sue's going easy on Will,
and even though the Glee Club</i>

00:07.046 --> 00:08.914
<i>worked really hard to get
to Regionals, they didn't win.</i>

00:08.982 --> 00:10.983
Vocal Adrenaline!
<i>But it's okay
to not win an award,</i>

00:11.050 --> 00:13.185
<i>particularly when you had so
much fun getting there, right?</i>

00:13.252 --> 00:14.619
<i>Right?</i>

00:14.687 --> 00:16.088
We didn't even place.

00:16.155 --> 00:17.990
<i>And that's what
you missed on</i> Glee.

00:19.058 --> 00:21.093
Up here. Come on, focus.

00:21.160 --> 00:22.694
Okay.

00:22.762 --> 00:26.064
Hi, I'm Jacob Ben Israel
with <i>Glee's Big Gay Summer,</i>

00:26.132 --> 00:28.734
with all the Glee Club dish
you're dying to know.

00:28.801 --> 00:30.402
Rachel, how do you
respond to rumors

00:30.470 --> 00:32.337
you're incredibly difficult
to work with?

00:32.405 --> 00:34.272
Well, as her boyfriend,
I can answer that.

00:34.340 --> 00:35.474
We've been dating
all summer.

00:35.541 --> 00:36.942
Rachel's what you'd call

00:37.010 --> 00:38.110
a controllist.

00:38.177 --> 00:39.277
I-I'm controlling.

00:39.345 --> 00:40.278
"Controllist"
isn't a word.

00:40.346 --> 00:41.546
Oh.
I'm controlling.

00:41.614 --> 00:43.248
Performing is my life.

00:43.316 --> 00:45.784
And yes, do I have
opinions about it?

00:45.852 --> 00:47.819
Does my need to constantly
express those opinions

00:47.887 --> 00:49.021
annoy my fellow
Glee Clubbers?

00:49.088 --> 00:50.789
Yes.

00:50.857 --> 00:53.492
That was out loud, wasn't it?

00:53.559 --> 00:56.228
Will Schuester, how do you
respond to a recent post

00:56.295 --> 00:59.064
on my blog saying
your Glee Club song selections

00:59.132 --> 01:02.234
sound like they come from
a drag queen's iPod?

01:02.301 --> 01:04.403
Well, I try to do
something for everybody.

01:04.470 --> 01:08.840
Uh, 25% show tunes, 25%
hip-hop, 25% classic rock...

01:08.908 --> 01:10.475
100% gay.

01:10.543 --> 01:12.010
<i>Confirm or deny the rumor</i>

01:12.078 --> 01:14.212
that because you knocked up
Quinn Fabray,

01:14.280 --> 01:17.549
you spent all your summer pool
cleaning money on a vasectomy.

01:17.617 --> 01:18.984
It's true.

01:19.052 --> 01:20.719
It was the responsible
thing to do.

01:20.787 --> 01:23.722
Is it also true you're suffering
from a crippling depression

01:23.790 --> 01:27.192
because you're
not over Miss Fabray?

01:27.260 --> 01:31.563
How has life changed since
the birth of your bastard child?

01:31.631 --> 01:34.166
Well, I'm happy to be
back, and I'm ready

01:34.233 --> 01:35.434
to start fresh.

01:35.501 --> 01:39.204
And... I'm a lot less hormonal,

01:39.272 --> 01:41.039
so... so there's not
really any crying.

01:41.107 --> 01:42.340
How was your summer?

01:42.408 --> 01:44.543
My eyes are up here, JewFro.

01:44.610 --> 01:45.710
And it was uneventful.

01:45.778 --> 01:47.446
People thought I
went on vacation,

01:47.513 --> 01:49.881
but actually I spent the
summer lost in the sewers.

01:49.949 --> 01:51.083
<i>What can you say</i>

01:51.150 --> 01:53.118
about the rumors
the two of you are dating?

01:53.186 --> 01:54.119
Because we're
both Asian?

01:54.187 --> 01:55.187
That's racist.

01:55.254 --> 01:56.354
Totally racist.

02:00.193 --> 02:03.028
Did you get that?
Did you get that?

02:03.096 --> 02:04.062
You saw it here first.

02:06.032 --> 02:07.999
Did you know there's
a forum on my blog

02:08.067 --> 02:11.236
that's begging you
to stop rapping?

02:11.304 --> 02:13.505
Wait, th-the kids
don't like it when I rap?

02:13.573 --> 02:15.107
<i>When will you Glee Clubbers</i>

02:15.174 --> 02:17.242
accept the fact
that people hate you
Kiss it, Jacob.

02:17.310 --> 02:19.978
and think you're nothing
but a glorified karaoke club
Go away, go away.

02:20.046 --> 02:22.681
designed to make the inventors
of AutoTune millions of dollars?

02:22.748 --> 02:25.317
When exactly did you ink your
sponsorship with Lands' End?

02:25.384 --> 02:26.518
<i>When are you slated</i>

02:26.586 --> 02:28.954
to make your triumphant return
to the Shire?

02:29.021 --> 02:30.622
How do you get
the white on rice?

02:30.690 --> 02:32.224
What did you do with
all that breast milk?

02:32.291 --> 02:33.458
You know what, Jacob?

02:33.526 --> 02:35.227
It doesn't take much
courage for people

02:35.294 --> 02:37.195
to park their cottage cheese
behinds in their Barcaloungers

02:37.263 --> 02:38.497
and log on to
the Internet

02:38.564 --> 02:40.065
and start tearing
people down, does it?

02:40.133 --> 02:41.867
But you know what does
take some courage?

02:41.934 --> 02:44.369
Standing up and singing
about something.

02:44.437 --> 02:46.838
So here's a message for
everyone that reads your blog.

02:46.906 --> 02:49.141
Next time, instead of posting
an anonymous comment online,

02:49.208 --> 02:52.410
say what you have
to say to my face.

02:52.478 --> 02:55.714
Welcome back, lady!

02:55.781 --> 02:57.516
Whoo!

03:00.286 --> 03:02.187
I don't suppose there's
any way you could just

03:02.255 --> 03:04.055
cut out that last
part, is there?

03:04.123 --> 03:05.490
Mm-mm.

Hey, why so
glum, William?

03:32.685 --> 03:34.619
Cat crap in
your coffee?

03:34.687 --> 03:35.720
Or are you worried no one's

03:35.788 --> 03:36.855
signing up for
your little club there?

03:36.923 --> 03:38.023
Nah, not at all, Sue.

03:38.090 --> 03:39.758
Nationals are
in New York City this year.

03:39.825 --> 03:41.793
I think that list is
gonna be filled up in no time.

03:41.861 --> 03:43.161
Well, you know what
your problem is?

03:43.229 --> 03:44.529
"No tryouts,

03:44.597 --> 03:45.830
just sign up."

03:45.898 --> 03:47.232
Nobody wants to be

03:47.300 --> 03:49.000
part of a club that
just anyone can join.

03:49.068 --> 03:50.302
See this?

03:50.369 --> 03:52.304
It's a court summons--
child endangerment--

03:52.371 --> 03:54.005
'cause there's been a
line of would-be Cheerios!

03:54.073 --> 03:55.707
out there since
late July.

03:55.775 --> 03:58.109
I guess they lost their
humanity a little bit.

03:58.177 --> 04:00.078
One girl ate a pigeon,
several others

04:00.146 --> 04:03.114
started worshipping a possum
carcass as their lord.

04:03.182 --> 04:05.650
That's how much they
want to be Cheerios!

04:05.718 --> 04:06.985
Well, sorry, Sue.

04:07.053 --> 04:10.622
Anyone who wants to join
Glee Club gets to join.

04:10.690 --> 04:12.591
Oh, God, Will, let me
break it down for you.

04:12.658 --> 04:15.227
High school is a dry run
for the rest of your life.

04:15.294 --> 04:16.327
Not everyone can
be champions.

04:16.394 --> 04:18.663
Not everyone should
be champions.

04:18.731 --> 04:21.298
We need fry cooks
and bus drivers.

04:21.367 --> 04:24.169
Well, Sue, it's how I work,
and it's not going to change.

04:24.237 --> 04:25.904
I like being friends
with you, Will.

04:25.972 --> 04:27.372
This is fun.

04:27.440 --> 04:29.274
You make not trying to
destroy Glee Club easy.

04:29.342 --> 04:30.642
You know why?

04:30.710 --> 04:32.677
'Cause you're doing such
a bang-up job of it

04:32.745 --> 04:34.079
all by yourself.

04:35.248 --> 04:37.249
Oh, it's time to feed my gimp.

04:37.316 --> 04:39.718
Oh, and also,
Figgins wants to see us.

04:40.920 --> 04:42.220
Ah-ah-ah! Not you!

04:42.288 --> 04:43.388
Hands off that list.

04:45.591 --> 04:47.125
Cut my budget?

04:47.193 --> 04:49.527
You can't cut my budget
without written consent

04:49.595 --> 04:51.696
from the President
of the Federal Reserve!

04:51.764 --> 04:53.365
It's in my contract!

04:53.432 --> 04:55.200
Oh, Sue, I think you can manage

04:55.268 --> 04:58.136
a sixth national title
without two confetti cannons.

04:58.204 --> 05:00.272
Do you think your kids can
manage life without their daddy?

05:00.339 --> 05:01.940
We're barely surviving
on the budget we have.

05:02.008 --> 05:03.074
Slashing the Glee budget

05:03.142 --> 05:04.509
by ten percent,

05:04.577 --> 05:06.011
cutting our transportation
to and from events

05:06.078 --> 05:07.712
is like cutting our legs off.

05:07.780 --> 05:09.514
Sacrifices must be made.

05:09.582 --> 05:11.650
This is being mandated
at the district level, guys.

05:11.717 --> 05:14.519
Studies show that the best way
to bring in alumni donations

05:14.587 --> 05:16.288
is through a successful
athletic department--

05:16.355 --> 05:18.056
specifically,

05:18.124 --> 05:19.658
a winning football team.
Who's this?

05:21.560 --> 05:23.728
I'm Shannon Beiste;
I'm the new football coach.

05:23.796 --> 05:25.797
Spelled B-E-I-S-T-E.

05:25.865 --> 05:27.465
- It's French.
- I'm sorry,

05:27.533 --> 05:28.466
what happened to Ken Tanaka?

05:28.534 --> 05:29.634
Nervous breakdown.

05:29.702 --> 05:31.936
Don't look at it

05:32.004 --> 05:33.571
as a punishment,

05:33.639 --> 05:36.441
look at it as an investment
into your clubs' futures.

05:36.509 --> 05:37.876
The more money
the football program

05:37.943 --> 05:40.245
brings in, the more I can
give back to you guys!

05:40.313 --> 05:41.846
Coach Beiste here

05:41.914 --> 05:43.915
is fresh off
her fifth consecutive

05:43.983 --> 05:45.116
all-Missouri high school

05:45.184 --> 05:46.618
football championship.

05:46.686 --> 05:48.019
We're very lucky to have her!

05:48.087 --> 05:49.721
What can I say?
I like a challenge.

05:50.723 --> 05:51.923
First of all,

05:51.991 --> 05:54.459
a female football coach,
like a male nurse--

05:54.527 --> 05:56.061
sin against nature.

05:56.128 --> 05:59.931
Number two, I'm sure you're
used to Hillbilly parents

05:59.999 --> 06:01.933
yelping adulation at
you as they attempt

06:02.001 --> 06:05.637
to impregnate the tailpipes
of various off-road vehicles.

06:05.705 --> 06:09.240
But you're in my
house now, Beiste.

06:09.308 --> 06:12.577
No one comes into my
house and steals from me.

06:12.645 --> 06:17.248
Do not get up
in a panther's business, lady.

06:17.316 --> 06:19.351
You're all coffee
and no omelet.

06:20.720 --> 06:22.520
That
doesn't make any sense.

06:22.588 --> 06:26.257
Coach, uh, Beiste, I-I think you
understand our frustration.

06:26.325 --> 06:28.259
Our budgets just got
cut by ten percent.

06:28.327 --> 06:29.427
It should have been more!

06:29.495 --> 06:31.563
You think there's not
something wrong when

06:31.630 --> 06:32.931
the cheerleaders' budget's
higher than the people

06:32.998 --> 06:34.132
who they're cheering for?

06:34.200 --> 06:36.334
Well, sure, but the
Glee Club is a...

06:36.402 --> 06:38.336
The Glee Club?
You came in third last year

06:38.404 --> 06:40.772
and you're asking
for more money?

06:42.074 --> 06:44.642
That's a steer with
six teats and no oink.

06:49.248 --> 06:50.315
This doesn't make any sense.

06:50.383 --> 06:51.316
What?

06:52.651 --> 06:53.618
These are comments

06:53.686 --> 06:54.853
from Jacob Ben-Israel's

06:54.920 --> 06:56.388
most recent Glee Club blog.

06:56.455 --> 06:59.124
"Glee is a giant ball of suck."

06:59.191 --> 07:01.593
We get it, Mr. Shue.
Everyone still hates us.

07:01.660 --> 07:04.763
So what? So we're plankton
on the high school food chain?

07:04.830 --> 07:06.965
Only difference now
is that none of us really care.

07:07.032 --> 07:09.200
Kurt's right. We're a family.
They can bring it all they want.

07:09.268 --> 07:10.535
None of it is going
to break us.

07:10.603 --> 07:12.604
Okay, I'm really happy
that you guys have all bonded.

07:12.671 --> 07:15.707
The problem is that
all of this negative stuff

07:15.775 --> 07:17.609
is keeping other students
from auditioning.

07:17.676 --> 07:19.477
Good.
Why do we need new members?

07:19.545 --> 07:21.112
Well, since Matt
transferred,

07:21.180 --> 07:22.614
we only have 11 members,

07:22.681 --> 07:23.815
and if we want to
go to Nationals,

07:23.883 --> 07:25.049
if we want to beat
Vocal Adrenaline,

07:25.117 --> 07:26.918
we have to go from
a small rebel force

07:26.986 --> 07:28.353
to a giant wall of sound.

07:28.421 --> 07:30.855
Yeah, Mr. Schuester's
right, you guys.

07:30.923 --> 07:33.324
You didn't see Vocal Adrenaline
at Regionals. They were epic.

07:33.392 --> 07:35.360
We're going to need more voices
in order to beat them.

07:35.428 --> 07:37.796
Yeah. I'm with Rachel
on this one.

07:37.863 --> 07:39.164
Gross.

07:39.231 --> 07:41.399
You're going to have to
trust me on this, guys.

07:41.467 --> 07:43.268
Now, here's the plan.

07:43.335 --> 07:45.470
Nationals are in
New York this year,

07:45.538 --> 07:48.673
and we are going.

07:48.741 --> 07:50.074
Now let's go out there

07:50.142 --> 07:51.709
and show the school how
cool it's going to be,

07:51.777 --> 07:53.344
how cool we can be.

07:53.412 --> 07:55.580
If they're not going to come
to us, let's go to them.

07:55.648 --> 07:58.416
They say we only sing
show tunes and '80s pop.

07:58.484 --> 08:01.052
Let's show them how down we are.

08:01.120 --> 08:02.887
Let's give them the
song of the year,

08:02.955 --> 08:04.923
New Directions! style.

08:04.990 --> 08:06.357
Okay.
Whoo!
Whoo!
Yeah!

08:10.996 --> 08:12.430
âª Bum bum bum âª

08:12.498 --> 08:15.834
âª Bah bah bah bah bah âª

08:15.901 --> 08:17.502
âª Bah bah bah âª
âª Bum bum bum âª

08:17.570 --> 08:19.771
âª Bah bah bah bah bah âª

08:19.839 --> 08:21.773
âª Bah bah bah âª

08:21.841 --> 08:23.541
âª Yeah, yeah,
I'm out that Brooklyn âª

08:23.609 --> 08:25.243
âª Now I'm down in Tribeca âª

08:25.311 --> 08:27.378
âª Right next to DeNiro,
but I'll be hood forever âª

08:27.446 --> 08:28.947
âª I'm the new Sinatra âª

08:29.014 --> 08:31.816
âª And since I made it here,
I can make it anywhere âª

08:31.884 --> 08:32.851
âª Yeah,
they love me everywhere âª

08:32.918 --> 08:34.552
âª I used to cop in Harlem âª

08:34.620 --> 08:35.653
âª All of my Dominicanos âª

08:35.721 --> 08:37.589
âª Right there up on Broadway âª

08:37.655 --> 08:39.057
âª Pull me back
to that McDonald's âª

08:39.124 --> 08:41.793
âª Took it to my stash box,
560 State Street âª

08:41.861 --> 08:44.329
âª Catch me in the kitchen like
a Simmons whippin' pastries âª

08:44.396 --> 08:45.830
âª <i>Aah, ooh</i> âª
âª Eight million stories âª

08:45.898 --> 08:46.931
âª Out there in it naked âª

08:46.999 --> 08:48.333
âª City, it's a pity âª

08:48.400 --> 08:50.134
âª Half of y'all won't make it âª

08:50.202 --> 08:52.170
âª Me, I got a plug,
Special Ed "I Got It Made" âª

08:52.238 --> 08:55.173
âª If Jesus payin' LeBron,
I'm payin' Dwyane Wade âª

08:55.241 --> 08:56.608
âª <i>Aah</i> âª

08:56.675 --> 08:58.543
âª Three dice cee-lo,

âª Labor Day Parade,
rest in peace, Bob Marley âª

09:00.513 --> 09:02.413
âª Jigga I be Spik'd out âª

09:02.481 --> 09:04.048
âª I could trip a referee âª

09:04.116 --> 09:07.852
âª Tell by my attitude
that I'm most definitely from âª

09:07.920 --> 09:09.621
âª New York âª
âª <i>Hey âª</i>

09:09.688 --> 09:13.758

09:13.826 --> 09:16.694
âª There's nothin' you can't do âª
âª <i>That Brooklyn</i> âª

09:16.762 --> 09:21.199

âª <i>You're in New York</i> âª

09:21.267 --> 09:22.667
âª <i>Welcome to the bright lights,

09:22.735 --> 09:24.402
âª These streets will make you

09:24.470 --> 09:27.672
âª Big lights will inspire you âª

09:27.740 --> 09:33.144

09:35.214 --> 09:38.182
âª One hand in the air

âª Street lights, big dreams,

âª No place in the world

09:43.422 --> 09:44.355
âª Put your lighters

09:44.423 --> 09:48.192
âª Everybody say "Yeah, yeah" âª

09:48.260 --> 09:51.296
âª Yeah, yeah âª

09:51.363 --> 09:54.399
âª In New York âª

09:54.466 --> 09:57.735
âª Concrete jungle

09:57.803 --> 10:00.572
âª There's nothing

10:00.639 --> 10:02.941

âª <i>New York, New York</i> âª

10:22.328 --> 10:24.228
âª Bah bah bah. âª

10:31.637 --> 10:33.404
Hey, Sue. Can I talk
to you for a second?

10:33.472 --> 10:35.173
Sure, buddy. You look steamed.

10:35.240 --> 10:37.208
Those kids went out and
really tried to show

10:37.276 --> 10:38.309
what Glee Club
was all about.

10:38.377 --> 10:39.777
And how does
the school repay them?

10:39.845 --> 10:41.679
By defacing the sign-up sheet.

10:41.747 --> 10:43.815
"Buttface McBallnuts."

10:43.882 --> 10:46.117
"Ass-braham Lin-colon."
They're not even funny!

10:46.185 --> 10:48.419
Now, don't be rude, William. I
put a lot of thought into those.

10:49.455 --> 10:52.256
Consider this a wakeup call.

10:52.324 --> 10:53.791
You're worried about
getting new recruits?

10:53.859 --> 10:56.494
Well, if Beiste get her way
and our budgets are slashed,

10:56.562 --> 10:58.396
you'll be cutting kids
left and right.

11:00.933 --> 11:01.899
You're right.

11:01.967 --> 11:03.568
I hadn't thought about that.

11:03.636 --> 11:08.406
Beiste needs to be stopped, and
I need your help to topple her.

11:08.474 --> 11:09.841
You in?

11:14.179 --> 11:15.480
I'm in.

11:19.758 --> 11:21.325
<i>I was really excited</i>

11:21.393 --> 11:23.027
<i>about my Glee Club recruit
poster design.</i>

11:23.094 --> 11:25.429
<i>I made it super masculine,
just like these pamphlets I saw</i>

11:25.497 --> 11:28.032
<i>some Army guys passing out
at a daycare center.</i>

11:28.099 --> 11:29.967
<i>Then, I heard something...</i>

11:30.035 --> 11:33.737
âª We both lie silent and still
in the dead of the night âª

11:33.805 --> 11:37.374
âª Although we lie close
together âª

11:37.442 --> 11:40.010
âª I feel like
we're miles apart... âª
<i>It was this new transfer kid.</i>

11:40.078 --> 11:42.413
<i>I saw him tapping his foot
when we busted it out</i>

11:42.480 --> 11:44.782
<i>in the courtyard the day
before...</i>

11:44.849 --> 11:49.186
âª Every rose has its thorn âª

11:49.254 --> 11:54.925
âª Just like every night
has its dawn âª

11:54.993 --> 11:57.494
<i>I would've joined in
with a kick-ass harmony,</i>

11:57.562 --> 11:59.029
<i>but the dude was naked.</i>

11:59.097 --> 12:02.533
âª Just like every cowboy sings
a sad, sad song... âª

12:14.346 --> 12:15.846
Oh, hello!

12:15.914 --> 12:17.748
I couldn't help
but notice you
admiring me

12:17.816 --> 12:19.149
yesterday in
the courtyard.
Um, what?

12:19.217 --> 12:20.517
Oh, you don't speak English.

12:20.585 --> 12:22.086
You like me sing!

12:22.153 --> 12:25.456
You like me sing very much!

12:25.523 --> 12:27.858
Um, I totally speak English.

12:27.926 --> 12:29.560
I even did
a little research on you.

12:29.627 --> 12:30.761
You're a foreign exchange
student

12:30.829 --> 12:33.063
named Sunshine Corazon
because you're from

12:33.131 --> 12:34.665
the Philippines,
where it's sunny every day.

12:34.733 --> 12:36.734
Except for the monsoons.
Listen, Sunshine,

12:36.801 --> 12:38.068
we need chorus members;

12:38.136 --> 12:40.070
people to stand behind me
and stare at me

12:40.138 --> 12:41.772
with wet, moved eyes
while I sing solos.

12:41.840 --> 12:46.276
So I encourage you
to audition for Glee Club!

12:46.344 --> 12:47.845
Glee Club is fun!

12:47.912 --> 12:51.181
Swaying in background
can be fun!

12:51.249 --> 12:52.483
Thank you.
Okay.

12:55.887 --> 12:59.690
âª Hello, hello, baby, you
called, I can't hear a thing âª

12:59.758 --> 13:03.260
âª I have got no service
in the club, you say, say? âª

13:03.328 --> 13:07.765
âª Wha-wha-what did you say?
Oh, you're breaking up on me âª

13:07.832 --> 13:11.168
âª Sorry, I cannot hear you,
I'm kinda busy âª

13:11.236 --> 13:13.170
âª K-kinda busy âª

13:13.238 --> 13:15.773
âª K-kinda busy âª

13:15.840 --> 13:19.743
âª Sorry, I cannot hear you,
I'm kinda busy âª

13:19.811 --> 13:21.745
âª Just a second,
it's my favorite song

13:21.813 --> 13:23.213
âª They're gonna play âª

13:23.281 --> 13:27.017
âª And I cannot text you
with a drink in my hand, eh? âª

13:27.085 --> 13:29.086
âª You shoulda made some plans
with me âª

13:29.154 --> 13:31.355
âª You knew that I was free âª

13:31.423 --> 13:35.325
âª And now you won't stop calling
me, I'm kinda busy âª

13:35.393 --> 13:39.863
âª Stop callin', stop callin',
I don't wanna think anymore! âª

13:39.931 --> 13:43.200
âª I left my head and my heart on
the dance floor âª

13:43.268 --> 13:47.971
âª Stop callin', stop callin',
I don't wanna talk anymore! âª

13:48.039 --> 13:51.375
âª I left my head and my heart on
the dance floor âª

13:53.478 --> 13:55.546
âª Stop telephoning me! âª

13:55.613 --> 13:58.082
âª <i>Stop telephoning me</i> âª

13:58.149 --> 14:00.017
âª I'm being... âª

14:00.085 --> 14:01.952
Shut up!

14:06.324 --> 14:07.491
That was fun.

14:07.559 --> 14:08.926
I'd love to join
your club.

14:08.993 --> 14:10.494
When are auditions?

14:10.562 --> 14:12.896
Let me get back
to you on that one.

14:12.964 --> 14:14.798
Don't tell anyone
about this, okay?

14:14.866 --> 14:16.233
Okay.

14:20.605 --> 14:23.006
We're trying to recruit
new members for Glee Club.

14:24.609 --> 14:26.477
The Panther isn't cool
with anything

14:26.544 --> 14:30.180
except doing exactly
what she says without question.

14:30.248 --> 14:31.682
That's how you win.

14:31.749 --> 14:33.383
Now, first
things first.

14:33.451 --> 14:34.785
You're all cut.

14:34.853 --> 14:37.121
Everyone starts
fresh with me.

14:37.188 --> 14:38.455
Tryouts start...

14:38.523 --> 14:40.390
right now.
Any questions?

14:40.458 --> 14:43.327
I got 25

14:43.394 --> 14:44.695
everything pies
for a Coach...

14:44.762 --> 14:46.463
Beiste?

14:46.531 --> 14:48.932
I didn't order any pizzas.

14:58.109 --> 15:00.644
Isn't this kind of immature?

15:00.712 --> 15:02.713
No, it's downright childish.

15:02.780 --> 15:04.748
But I know gals
like Beiste.

15:04.816 --> 15:07.484
Oh, her high school life
must have been miserable.

15:07.552 --> 15:09.987
She's oversized, humorless,

15:10.054 --> 15:12.356
refers to herself in the
third person as an animal.

15:13.892 --> 15:15.759
This kind of
abuse and teasing

15:15.827 --> 15:18.162
will bring back all
those childhood memories.

15:18.229 --> 15:20.130
She'll be shaken
to her core.

15:20.198 --> 15:21.465
Humiliated
and devastated.

15:21.533 --> 15:24.201
She'll have no choice
but to quit her job,

15:24.269 --> 15:26.436
and our budgets
will be restored.

15:26.504 --> 15:27.704
Yes!

15:27.772 --> 15:29.306
The boss says, uh,

15:29.374 --> 15:32.142
if you don't pay
for 'em, I have to.

15:32.210 --> 15:35.445
Which means we have
to reuse my kid's Pampers.

15:35.513 --> 15:37.881
For another week.

15:45.590 --> 15:47.491
Hand 'em out, Wayne Newton.

15:47.559 --> 15:49.493
All right, guys,
it's a pizza party.

15:49.561 --> 15:50.661
Dig in.

15:50.728 --> 15:53.163
Everybody has to eat
at least four slices.

15:53.231 --> 15:54.231
Let's go!

15:54.299 --> 15:55.332
And when you're done,

15:55.400 --> 15:56.633
full pads out on the field.

15:56.701 --> 15:57.968
We're doing wind sprints.

15:58.036 --> 15:59.203
And the first ten

15:59.270 --> 16:02.239
to puke are off the team.

16:08.246 --> 16:11.281
Hey, guys, um, there's pizza
in there, if you want some.

16:11.349 --> 16:12.216
Thank you.
Thank you.

16:16.287 --> 16:18.188
I figured that if Kurt's
gay and he can do it,

16:18.256 --> 16:19.590
then why can't I?

16:19.657 --> 16:21.425
Being gay isn't
a handicap, Artie.

16:21.492 --> 16:23.460
How can you play football
in a wheelchair, anyway?

16:23.528 --> 16:24.561
I have to get

16:24.629 --> 16:25.829
on that team, Finn.

16:26.998 --> 16:28.865
Dude, what's this about?

16:28.933 --> 16:30.434
Tina.

16:30.501 --> 16:32.669
She dumped me for Mike Chang.

16:32.737 --> 16:37.207
They fell in love over
the summer at... Asian Camp.

16:37.275 --> 16:39.376
<i>They were counselors,
in charge of teaching</i>

16:39.444 --> 16:42.346
<i>all those tech-savvy Asian kids
about the arts.</i>

16:42.413 --> 16:46.650
âª Getting to know
all about you âª

16:46.718 --> 16:49.920
âª Getting to like you... âª

16:54.959 --> 16:56.360
So, what did Tina say

16:56.427 --> 16:58.128
when she broke
up with you?

16:58.196 --> 17:00.364
I think you're great, Artie,
but you're a terrible boyfriend.

17:00.431 --> 17:01.832
You ignored me for
weeks this summer.

17:01.899 --> 17:03.867
I was playing a marathon
round of Halo, woman.

17:03.935 --> 17:05.469
And then when we
did get together,

17:05.536 --> 17:08.605
all you wanted to do was watch
<i>Coming Home</i> over and over.

17:08.673 --> 17:11.275
Mike tries to be
into what <i>I'm</i> into.

17:11.342 --> 17:13.175
Like his abs.

17:15.646 --> 17:17.013
Dude, I'm sympathetic for you;

17:17.080 --> 17:19.583
I just don't see you
on the football team.

17:19.651 --> 17:21.484
Imagine you were pushing me
in this big hunk of metal

17:21.551 --> 17:22.886
down the field at full speed.

17:22.954 --> 17:24.521
The centrifugal force
would be too much to stop.

17:24.589 --> 17:25.622
I'd be like a medieval

17:25.690 --> 17:27.057
battering ram.

17:28.526 --> 17:30.594
Dude, you'd be like
a human cannonball.

17:30.662 --> 17:31.795
That would be awesome!

17:31.863 --> 17:33.697
So you'll help?

17:34.932 --> 17:37.301
Sure. But you got
to help me first.

17:37.368 --> 17:39.369
Hey, Sam.

17:39.437 --> 17:41.238
My name's Finn.

17:41.306 --> 17:42.105
This here is Artie.

17:42.173 --> 17:43.373
Yeah, I know who you are.

17:43.441 --> 17:45.309
You're the... the quarterback.

17:45.376 --> 17:47.311
Exactly-- which
makes me very cool.

17:47.378 --> 17:49.346
And we'd like to talk
to you about Glee Club.

17:50.715 --> 17:52.482
So, Sam, tell us
about yourself.

17:52.550 --> 17:54.151
My name's Sam Evans.

17:54.218 --> 17:55.652
I like comic books,

17:55.720 --> 17:57.054
sports.

17:57.121 --> 17:59.456
I'm dyslexic, so my grades
aren't that good, but...

17:59.524 --> 18:00.791
I'm working on it.

18:00.858 --> 18:02.125
Dude, your
mouth is huge.

18:02.193 --> 18:04.161
How many tennis balls
can you fit in there?

18:04.228 --> 18:06.963
I don't... know. I've never
had any balls in my mouth.

18:07.031 --> 18:07.664
Have you?

18:11.002 --> 18:12.536
I like this kid.

18:12.603 --> 18:14.237
I like his confidence,

18:14.305 --> 18:15.572
but the Bieber cut's
gotta go.

18:15.640 --> 18:16.773
Mm-hmm.

18:16.841 --> 18:18.275
So, can you sing
with that big mouth?

18:18.343 --> 18:19.743
I've never really sung

18:19.811 --> 18:21.411
in front of
anybody before.

18:21.479 --> 18:24.648
Dude, let me tell you,
chicks dig singers.

18:24.716 --> 18:26.216
Well, give it a shot.

18:26.284 --> 18:27.617
We'll back you up, I promise.

18:27.685 --> 18:29.319
What song you got
in your back pocket?

18:29.387 --> 18:31.588
Um... "Billionaire"?

18:36.127 --> 18:38.428
âª I wanna be a billionaire âª

18:38.496 --> 18:41.465
âª So freakin' bad âª

18:41.532 --> 18:45.268
âª Buy all of the things
I never had âª

18:47.171 --> 18:49.806
âª I wanna be on the cover of âª

18:49.874 --> 18:52.576
âª <i>Forbes</i> magazine âª

18:52.643 --> 18:56.980
âª Smiling next to Oprah
and the Queen âª

18:57.048 --> 19:00.083
âª Oh, every time I close âª

19:00.151 --> 19:01.952
âª My eyes âª

19:03.621 --> 19:08.058
âª I see my name
in shining lights âª

19:08.126 --> 19:09.426
âª Yeah âª

19:09.494 --> 19:11.928
âª A different city every night âª

19:11.996 --> 19:13.897
âª Oh, I âª

19:13.965 --> 19:15.665
âª I swear âª

19:15.733 --> 19:17.634
âª The world better prepare âª

19:17.702 --> 19:21.705
âª For when I'm a billionaire âª

19:21.773 --> 19:24.307
âª Yeah, I would have
a show like Oprah âª

19:24.375 --> 19:25.542
âª I would be the host of âª

19:25.610 --> 19:26.877
âª Every day Christmas âª

19:26.944 --> 19:28.412
âª Give Artie a wish list âª

19:28.479 --> 19:30.881
âª I'll probably pull
a Angelina and Brad Pitt âª

19:30.948 --> 19:33.750
âª And adopt a bunch of babies
that ain't never had it âª

19:33.818 --> 19:36.219
âª Give away a few Mercedes
like, "Here, lady, have this" âª

19:36.287 --> 19:39.623
âª And last but not least,
grant somebody their last wish âª

19:39.690 --> 19:42.192
âª It's been a couple months
that I been single, so âª

19:42.260 --> 19:44.761
âª You can call me Artie Claus,
minus the ho-ho âª

19:44.829 --> 19:48.231
âª Ha-ha! Get it? I'll probably
visit where Katrina hit âª

19:48.299 --> 19:50.934
âª And darn sure do
a lot more than FEMA did âª

19:51.002 --> 19:53.236
âª Yeah, can't forget
about me, stupid âª

19:53.304 --> 19:56.106
âª Everywhere I go,
I'm-a have my own theme music âª

19:56.174 --> 19:59.443
âª Oh, every time
I close my eyes âª

19:59.510 --> 20:01.611
âª Uh, what you see,
what you see, bruh? âª

20:01.679 --> 20:05.582
âª I see my name
in shining lights âª

20:05.650 --> 20:07.584
âª Uh-huh, uh-huh,
and what else? âª
âª Oh, yeah âª

20:07.652 --> 20:09.820
âª A different city every night âª

20:09.887 --> 20:14.090
âª Oh, I, I swear âª
âª Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah âª

20:14.158 --> 20:15.992
âª World better prepare âª
âª For what? âª

20:16.060 --> 20:18.528
âª For when I'm a billionaire âª

20:18.596 --> 20:20.897
âª <i>Oh, oh, oh, oh</i> âª

20:20.965 --> 20:22.032
âª Oh! âª

20:22.099 --> 20:24.768
âª When I'm a billionaire âª

20:24.836 --> 20:26.636
âª <i>Oh, oh, oh, oh</i> âª

20:26.704 --> 20:29.206
âª Sing it! âª
âª When I'm a billionaire âª

20:29.273 --> 20:32.008
âª <i>Oh, oh, oh, oh</i> âª

20:32.076 --> 20:33.043
âª Oh! âª

20:35.213 --> 20:37.547
âª I wanna be a billionaire âª

20:37.615 --> 20:41.485
âª So freakin' bad. âª

20:44.255 --> 20:45.789
That-that was really cool!

20:45.857 --> 20:48.058
Nice. So you think
you can come back

20:48.125 --> 20:49.359
and do that
in front of everybody?

20:49.427 --> 20:50.560
Sure.

20:57.665 --> 20:59.433
So, is that
a men's sweater?

20:59.500 --> 21:01.301
Fashion has no gender.

21:01.369 --> 21:03.537
Ladies, we have a problem.

21:03.605 --> 21:05.305
There's a new student
at this school

21:05.373 --> 21:08.141
named Sunshine who is a Filipino
and is shorter than me.

21:08.209 --> 21:10.143
Which I didn't think
was possible and
is very unnerving.

21:10.211 --> 21:11.745
Okay, so I'm
gonna go now.

21:11.813 --> 21:12.613
Wait!

21:12.680 --> 21:14.047
And...

21:14.115 --> 21:16.450
she has a remarkable voice.

21:17.852 --> 21:19.052
I'm just...

21:19.120 --> 21:20.454
I'm very worried.

21:20.521 --> 21:22.022
You know, not-not for myself,

21:22.090 --> 21:25.158
but for my lesser Glee Clubbers
who don't get as many solos.

21:25.226 --> 21:28.261
So I've paid a hundred dollars
to Azimio and Karofsky

21:28.329 --> 21:30.130
to brutally slushie us
in front of Sunshine's locker,

21:30.198 --> 21:32.199
terrifying her and ensuring
she doesn't sign up.

21:32.266 --> 21:34.968
Okay, so this is the part
where you're supposed to be

21:35.036 --> 21:36.103
hugging me and thanking me.

21:36.170 --> 21:38.171
That's awful. You're awful.

21:38.239 --> 21:39.539
But solos! I mean...

21:39.607 --> 21:41.808
Look, Rachel, Mercedes and I
are about as self-involved

21:41.876 --> 21:43.577
as they come, but
more than anything,

21:43.645 --> 21:45.379
we want to beat
Vocal Adrenaline.

21:45.446 --> 21:47.981
And if there's someone
at the school that
can help us do that,

21:48.049 --> 21:48.682
they're in.

21:50.918 --> 21:52.252
You know what?

21:53.454 --> 21:55.789
You're right.

21:55.857 --> 21:56.923
It's just...

21:56.991 --> 21:58.892
so like me to just be

21:58.960 --> 22:01.862
totally blinded by my concern
for the two of you.

22:01.929 --> 22:04.831
I'll-I'll-I'll go talk
to Sunshine now

22:04.899 --> 22:08.669
and just let her know
how truly welcome she really is.

22:08.736 --> 22:10.303
Thanks.

22:17.612 --> 22:19.246
Hi.

22:19.313 --> 22:21.248
So, here's the address
for the audition tomorrow

22:21.315 --> 22:22.516
and helpful directions.

22:22.583 --> 22:23.917
Look forward
to seeing you there.

22:23.985 --> 22:25.819
Thanks.

22:32.326 --> 22:34.361
Beiste is on the move.

22:34.429 --> 22:36.430
Operation Mean Girl is a go.

22:38.499 --> 22:40.467
Move. Go! Disperse.

22:40.535 --> 22:42.669
Leave the Danish.

22:48.076 --> 22:49.609
Anyone sitting here?
Yes.

22:49.677 --> 22:52.245
These seats are currently being
occupied by my ghost friends.

22:52.313 --> 22:53.880
I beg your pardon?

22:53.948 --> 22:55.849
My ghost friends.

22:55.917 --> 22:57.284
Hideous, lonely
faculty members

22:57.351 --> 22:58.618
who met with an early death

22:58.686 --> 23:00.787
from good old-fashioned
schoolyard bullying.

23:00.855 --> 23:02.089
And you know why?

23:02.156 --> 23:03.857
They tried to cross me.

23:03.925 --> 23:05.292
So why don't you
just keep on walking?

23:11.365 --> 23:12.499
Hi, Will.

23:12.567 --> 23:14.234
You... you mind
if I sit here?

23:14.302 --> 23:15.902
Uh... sorry.

23:15.970 --> 23:17.571
Taken.

23:17.638 --> 23:19.339
How about there?

23:19.407 --> 23:23.343
Actually, they're all
sort of taken.

23:23.411 --> 23:26.113
I am, uh, meeting
with some...

23:26.180 --> 23:27.180
some science teachers.

23:27.248 --> 23:29.416
You think it's easy being

23:29.484 --> 23:31.985
a female football coach,
being different?

23:32.053 --> 23:34.488
You think I don't get this
everywhere I go?

23:34.555 --> 23:36.022
Everybody told me

23:36.090 --> 23:38.458
that Sue was the school bully
and, uh...

23:38.526 --> 23:40.560
that you were really cool.

23:40.628 --> 23:42.462
I see they got that last part
wrong, huh?

24:02.216 --> 24:04.451
So you know why Helen
Keller couldn't drive, right?

24:04.519 --> 24:05.886
Why?

24:05.953 --> 24:08.188
'Cause she
was a woman.

24:10.324 --> 24:11.391
Coach Beiste?

24:12.727 --> 24:14.995
Are you crying?

24:15.062 --> 24:17.097
Yeah.

24:17.165 --> 24:20.400
Saw your stats from last season,
and it really hurt my feelings.

24:24.672 --> 24:27.841
Hey, Coach, uh,
this is Artie.

24:27.909 --> 24:29.075
He'd like
to try out

24:29.143 --> 24:30.510
for the team.

24:30.578 --> 24:33.013
You screwing with me?

24:33.080 --> 24:35.148
No, no. Absolutely not.

24:35.216 --> 24:37.083
Uh, see we
figured that

24:37.151 --> 24:39.686
if I push him down the field
fast enough, the centrifugal...

24:39.754 --> 24:40.821
Centrifugal.
Centrifugal force.

24:40.888 --> 24:41.988
You're out.

24:42.056 --> 24:44.124
Wait. What?!

24:44.192 --> 24:46.226
You're off the team, cut, out!

24:46.294 --> 24:49.596
You come in here,
pushing a kid in a wheelchair,

24:49.664 --> 24:51.398
making me look like
some kind of monster

24:51.465 --> 24:53.166
because I have
to tell him he can't play?

24:53.234 --> 24:55.068
No. No, that's not

24:55.136 --> 24:56.970
what was going
on here. Artie?
I really want to play.

24:57.038 --> 24:58.405
I want my
girlfriend back,

24:58.472 --> 24:59.840
and I want abs.

25:01.409 --> 25:02.375
Yeah, he's like

25:02.443 --> 25:03.944
a human battering ram,
like, like,

25:04.011 --> 25:05.045
Braveheart.
You know what?

25:05.112 --> 25:07.280
I don't like being screwed with!

25:07.348 --> 25:09.449
Do you understand me?
Dude, you're
totally overreacting.

25:09.517 --> 25:11.084
Dude?

25:11.152 --> 25:13.753
Get the hell out
of my locker room!

25:13.821 --> 25:15.989
Go!

25:17.892 --> 25:19.826
Think this is some joke?

25:20.995 --> 25:22.162
Go!

25:33.474 --> 25:35.008
Next!

25:38.613 --> 25:40.680
No way. Get out.

25:40.748 --> 25:42.082
Coach Sylvester,
please hear me out.

25:42.150 --> 25:45.051
Nope. I trusted you,
and you let me down.

25:45.119 --> 25:46.820
I don't want you
anywhere near my squad.

25:46.888 --> 25:48.388
You'll deafen them
with the sound

25:48.456 --> 25:50.357
of your stretch marks
rubbing together.

25:50.424 --> 25:52.392
I understand you had your
confetti cannons taken away.

25:52.460 --> 25:53.593
Well, I'll bet

25:53.661 --> 25:55.128
there are quite a few
church groups

25:55.196 --> 25:56.329
who would gladly give money

25:56.397 --> 25:57.764
to a squad
who helped rehabilitate

25:57.832 --> 25:59.199
a girl who got pregnant

25:59.267 --> 26:00.967
and now speaks out
for abstinence education

26:01.035 --> 26:02.035
while wearing
a Cheerios! uniform.

26:03.237 --> 26:04.871
Next!

26:09.710 --> 26:12.078
Oh, my gosh, Coach.

26:12.146 --> 26:14.147
Wait. You're serious? Finn?

26:14.215 --> 26:16.183
My eyes are still burning.

26:16.250 --> 26:18.018
I'm Finn Hudson,

26:18.085 --> 26:20.687
and I'd like
to audition for the Cheerios!

26:23.191 --> 26:24.991
âª I've got the power âª

26:25.059 --> 26:26.526
âª Power âª

26:31.599 --> 26:33.533
âª I've got the power âª

26:33.601 --> 26:35.435
âª Power âª

26:36.404 --> 26:37.470
Am I dreaming?

26:37.538 --> 26:39.005
âª I've got the power... âª

26:39.073 --> 26:40.207
Is this happening?

26:40.274 --> 26:42.042
But... why?

26:45.580 --> 26:47.480
Coach Beiste kicked me off
the football team.

26:47.548 --> 26:49.916
I'm not the quarterback anymore,

26:49.984 --> 26:52.252
which... means I'm nothing.

26:53.721 --> 26:55.755
I miss being popular.

26:55.823 --> 26:57.757
This is really
embarrassing.

26:57.825 --> 26:59.826
I have really great
leadership skills,

26:59.894 --> 27:02.696
and, uh, I'm athletic,

27:02.763 --> 27:04.631
so I could help
with the lifts and stuff.

27:07.001 --> 27:09.469
I hope you'll consider me.

27:09.537 --> 27:12.138
<i>Why would he get kicked off
the football team?</i>

27:12.206 --> 27:15.408
Finn was just trying to help out
his handicapable friend!

27:15.476 --> 27:16.977
He was
insubordinate twice.

27:17.044 --> 27:19.179
I'm the captain
of the USS <i>Kick Ass,</i>

27:19.247 --> 27:20.714
not the USS <i>Back Talk.</i>

27:22.083 --> 27:23.583
Please, Coach,
don't do this to me.

27:23.651 --> 27:25.118
I need football. It's who I am.

27:25.186 --> 27:27.888
I thought you were the Glee guy.
I mean, what with all

27:27.955 --> 27:30.457
the sign-up sheets you put
in my locker room.
Finn is a really good kid.

27:30.524 --> 27:32.425
Give him a chance
to show you.

27:32.493 --> 27:34.895
You mean don't make a
snap judgment about him?

27:34.962 --> 27:36.563
Don't make his
life miserable

27:36.631 --> 27:38.832
because I assume
he's a certain way?

27:38.900 --> 27:40.834
Okay, I get it.

27:40.902 --> 27:42.335
This is about me.

27:42.403 --> 27:43.803
I haven't been
very welcoming,

27:43.871 --> 27:46.573
but please, <i>please,</i>
don't take this out on Finn.

27:46.641 --> 27:48.041
Am I through here,
Principal Figgins?

27:48.109 --> 27:49.409
Mm-hmm.

27:56.384 --> 27:57.651
A little bird told me

27:57.718 --> 27:59.085
that someone spent
her summer vacation

27:59.153 --> 28:00.854
getting a brand-new set
of melons,

28:00.922 --> 28:02.722
even though you know
I have a very strict

28:02.790 --> 28:04.958
no plastics policy in Cheerios!

28:05.026 --> 28:06.893
Care to comment?

28:06.961 --> 28:08.962
I just...

28:09.030 --> 28:11.831
What would possess a person
your age to get a boob job?

28:11.899 --> 28:14.534
You don't even know what
your body's going to look like.

28:14.602 --> 28:17.704
It's an insult to nature
and completely distracting.

28:17.772 --> 28:19.706
I can't take my eyes off them.

28:19.774 --> 28:21.241
I'm actually talking to them

28:21.309 --> 28:22.475
right now.

28:22.543 --> 28:23.977
I wanted people
to notice me more.

28:24.045 --> 28:25.645
I don't get
what the big deal is.

28:25.713 --> 28:27.447
Well, the big deal is
that a person

28:27.515 --> 28:29.482
who has to pump her nonnies
full of gravy

28:29.550 --> 28:31.284
to feel good about herself
clearly doesn't have

28:31.352 --> 28:32.686
the self-esteem
to be my head cheerleader.

28:34.655 --> 28:36.790
Quinn will replace you.

28:36.857 --> 28:37.991
What did...?

28:38.059 --> 28:40.293
Oh, and Boobs McGee?

28:40.361 --> 28:42.329
You're demoted
to the bottom of the pyramid,

28:42.396 --> 28:44.864
so when it collapses,
your exploding

28:44.932 --> 28:47.133
sandbags will protect the squad
from injury.

28:48.569 --> 28:51.004
Now take your juicy,

28:51.072 --> 28:53.173
vine-ripened chest fruit

28:53.240 --> 28:54.808
and get the hell
out of my office.

29:23.170 --> 29:24.604
You did this to me.

29:24.672 --> 29:26.673
You told Coach Sylvester
about my summer surgery!

29:26.741 --> 29:28.708
You have a surgery when
you get your appendix out.

29:28.776 --> 29:30.844
You got a boob job.
Yup, sure did.

29:30.911 --> 29:32.512
You can't hit me.

29:32.580 --> 29:35.081
Oh, sure I can, unless you got
yourself knocked up again, slut.

29:37.118 --> 29:38.451
Stop the violence.

29:41.288 --> 29:43.356
Hey, hey, what is this?!

29:43.424 --> 29:45.225
Stop it.
What happened
to us being a family? Hey.

29:45.292 --> 29:46.359
Oh, please.
Stop that.

29:46.427 --> 29:47.494
She has a family.
She's a mother.

29:47.561 --> 29:48.862
Walk away.
Hey!

29:48.929 --> 29:51.197
And tighten up your pony
before you get to class!

30:06.953 --> 30:08.320
Well, hate to
break it to you,

30:08.388 --> 30:09.789
but it doesn't look like
anyone's gonna be joining us,

30:09.856 --> 30:11.290
so I think we should
just call it a day.

30:11.358 --> 30:12.958
We said 3:00 to 5:00.
It's only 4:58.

30:13.026 --> 30:15.094
Just wait. My buddy
Sam's gonna try out.

30:15.162 --> 30:16.128
He totally
idolizes me.

30:16.196 --> 30:17.363
Oh, face it, Finn.

30:17.431 --> 30:18.564
You're no longer
the quarterback.

30:18.632 --> 30:20.032
You're not
the Pied Piper anymore.

30:20.100 --> 30:21.500
No one's gonna
follow you around

30:21.568 --> 30:23.035
thinking everything
you do is cool.

30:23.103 --> 30:24.537
What about that Sunshine girl?

30:24.604 --> 30:26.439
I thought you said
she could sing.

30:26.506 --> 30:28.874
I guess she didn't want
to hang out with us losers.

30:33.647 --> 30:35.548
Show us on the doll

30:35.615 --> 30:38.083
where Coach
Beiste touched you.

30:39.853 --> 30:41.687
Here and here.

30:43.757 --> 30:44.757
This is outrageous.

30:44.825 --> 30:45.925
I'll say.

30:45.992 --> 30:47.426
Anyone who would prey on someone

30:47.494 --> 30:49.361
as sweet and simple
as poor, poor Brittany

30:49.429 --> 30:50.896
deserves everything
that's coming to her.

30:50.964 --> 30:54.233
I suggest immediate termination
and entry into the statewide

30:54.301 --> 30:55.167
sex offender
database.

30:55.235 --> 30:57.636
Sorry I'm late.

30:57.704 --> 30:59.572
What's going on?

30:59.639 --> 31:01.474
Brittany here
has accused Coach Beiste

31:01.541 --> 31:04.109
of inappropriate touching.

31:04.177 --> 31:06.645
What?! Brittany, that's
a serious accusation.

31:06.713 --> 31:08.747
It's very serious.

31:13.987 --> 31:17.656
Brittany, what you're saying
could ruin somebody's life.

31:17.724 --> 31:19.725
It's really important that
you tell the truth here.

31:21.428 --> 31:23.762
I made it up.

31:23.830 --> 31:26.265
Coach Beiste
didn't touch my boobs.

31:27.667 --> 31:29.201
Actually, I really want
to touch her boobs.

31:30.337 --> 31:31.737
If you're all done

31:31.805 --> 31:34.306
wasting my time,
I have a football team to coach.

31:34.374 --> 31:35.574
Coach...

31:40.847 --> 31:42.915
You're weak, Will!

31:42.983 --> 31:44.350
- You know what, Sue?
- Mr. Shue?

31:44.417 --> 31:45.518
Can we talk to you?

31:45.585 --> 31:47.453
It's kind of important.

31:55.428 --> 31:56.529
Tell me this isn't true, Rachel.

31:56.596 --> 31:58.097
She could have died.

31:58.164 --> 32:01.033
I didn't send her to
an <i>active</i> crack house.

32:01.101 --> 32:02.801
Besides, how did you guys
find out anyways?

32:02.869 --> 32:04.203
The Asian
community is
very tight.

32:04.271 --> 32:05.371
I just don't get it.

32:05.438 --> 32:06.605
You're better than this.

32:06.673 --> 32:07.873
No, she's an ambitious
little freak

32:07.941 --> 32:09.408
who will do anything
to hold on to her power.

32:09.476 --> 32:12.411
I just... I...
I love you guys so much.

32:13.513 --> 32:14.647
I was wrong before.

32:14.714 --> 32:15.881
I don't want any

32:15.949 --> 32:17.316
new members.

32:17.384 --> 32:19.752
I didn't want anyone coming in

32:19.819 --> 32:21.921
and-and messing up
our group dynamic.

32:21.988 --> 32:23.489
Tina, Mike,

32:23.557 --> 32:25.157
I mean,
what if Sunshine can dance?

32:25.225 --> 32:27.726
Then your contributions to Glee
will be even more insignificant

32:27.794 --> 32:29.562
than they
already are now.

32:29.629 --> 32:31.096
I did this for you guys.

32:33.533 --> 32:35.768
Whatever your motivations,

32:35.835 --> 32:37.770
you need
to make this right, Rachel.

32:45.045 --> 32:47.680
I'm sorry for sending you
to that crack house.

32:47.747 --> 32:50.983
They stole my sheet music
and used it for toilet paper.

32:51.051 --> 32:52.985
Look, I'll buy you
a new set.

32:53.053 --> 32:55.087
You can just, um,
come pick it up

32:55.155 --> 32:56.922
at the auditorium
at 4:00 tomorrow.

33:04.898 --> 33:07.733
Hi, I'm Sunshine Corazon,
and I'll be singing "Listen"

33:07.801 --> 33:09.435
from the movie <i>Dreamgirls.</i>

33:09.502 --> 33:11.337
Broadway show first.

33:11.404 --> 33:12.771
Shh...
Shut up.

33:15.275 --> 33:19.044
âª Listen âª

33:19.112 --> 33:22.548
âª To the song here in my heart âª

33:22.616 --> 33:26.485
âª A melody I start âª

33:26.553 --> 33:30.923
âª But can't complete âª

33:30.991 --> 33:33.926
âª Listen âª

33:33.994 --> 33:38.263
âª To the sound
from deep within âª

33:38.331 --> 33:41.300
âª It's only beginning âª

33:41.368 --> 33:45.471
âª To find release âª

33:45.538 --> 33:48.407
âª Oh, the time has come âª

33:48.475 --> 33:51.010
âª For my dreams to be heard âª

33:51.077 --> 33:54.913
âª They will not be pushed aside
and turned âª

33:54.981 --> 33:56.615
âª Into your own âª

33:56.683 --> 34:02.187
âª All 'cause you won't listen âª

34:02.255 --> 34:04.423
âª Listen âª

34:04.491 --> 34:08.293
âª I am alone at the crossroads âª

34:08.360 --> 34:11.496
âª I'm not at home
in my own home âª

34:11.563 --> 34:13.431
âª And I've tried and tried âª

34:13.500 --> 34:15.701
âª To say what's on my mind âª

34:15.768 --> 34:17.969
âª You should have known âª

34:18.038 --> 34:23.509
âª Oh, now I'm done
believin' you âª

34:23.576 --> 34:26.178
âª You don't know
what I'm feelin' âª

34:26.246 --> 34:29.081
âª I'm more than what
you made of me âª

34:29.149 --> 34:33.686
âª I followed the voice
you gave to me âª

34:33.753 --> 34:37.523
âª But now I gotta find my own âª

34:37.590 --> 34:41.060
âª I don't know where I belong âª

34:41.127 --> 34:45.496
âª But I'll be movin' on âª

34:45.565 --> 34:49.967
âª If you don't âª

34:50.036 --> 34:53.405
âª If you won't âª

34:53.473 --> 34:56.574
âª Listen âª

34:56.643 --> 35:00.446
âª To the song here in my heart âª

35:00.513 --> 35:03.415
âª A melody I start âª

35:03.483 --> 35:07.753
âª But I will complete âª

35:07.821 --> 35:10.589
âª Oh âª

35:10.657 --> 35:13.559
âª Now I'm done believin' you âª

35:13.626 --> 35:16.562
âª You don't know
what I'm feelin' âª

35:16.629 --> 35:20.199
âª I'm more than what
you made of me âª

35:20.266 --> 35:24.269
âª I followed the voice
you think you gave to me âª

35:24.337 --> 35:28.273
âª But now I gotta find âª

35:28.341 --> 35:31.510
âª My own... âª

35:31.578 --> 35:38.383
âª My own. âª

35:43.690 --> 35:45.624
Bravo!
Wow.

35:45.692 --> 35:47.793
Um...

35:47.861 --> 35:49.661
Welcome to the Glee Club.

35:51.431 --> 35:52.765
Thank you.
Amazing.

35:52.832 --> 35:54.466
Thank you.

35:58.849 --> 36:01.684
Do you mind
if I join you?

36:02.853 --> 36:04.954
Okay.

36:08.125 --> 36:11.660
Look, I really owe you
an apology.

36:11.728 --> 36:14.597
I guess I kicked this year off
thinking that all of us

36:14.664 --> 36:16.165
in the Glee Club weren't
outcasts anymore,

36:16.233 --> 36:18.667
and I thought
we'd be turning kids away.

36:20.036 --> 36:22.838
And then when no one
signed up for the club,

36:22.906 --> 36:26.642
I realized that we were still
at the bottom... outsiders.

36:28.512 --> 36:30.346
And that's how I made you feel.

36:32.449 --> 36:34.784
I'm sorry.

36:34.851 --> 36:37.553
Thank you.

36:39.055 --> 36:41.323
William, Beiste,

36:41.391 --> 36:43.993
I wanted to make a peace
offering with a batch of

36:44.060 --> 36:46.395
warm, homemade cookies.

36:47.898 --> 36:49.198
Oh, those smell
like dog poop.

36:49.266 --> 36:51.133
Are those dog poop cookies?

36:51.201 --> 36:54.036
No, that's the flaxseed oil
you're smelling.

36:54.104 --> 36:55.905
These are heart-healthy
cookies for some of our

36:55.972 --> 36:57.273
burlier Americans.

36:57.340 --> 37:00.476
Sue, we're not going
to do this anymore.

37:00.544 --> 37:05.047
Are you turning on me in public?

37:06.716 --> 37:09.251
The two of you are making a
very serious mistake today,

37:09.319 --> 37:11.854
the likes of which have not been
seen since the Mexican Indians

37:11.922 --> 37:13.789
sold Manhattan
to George Washington

37:13.857 --> 37:16.458
for an upskirt photo
of Betsy Ross.

37:24.267 --> 37:26.502
Hey, man, uh,
why didn't you show

37:26.570 --> 37:28.070
at the audition?

37:28.138 --> 37:32.408
I wanted to, I did, but after
what Coach Beiste did to you...

37:34.177 --> 37:36.245
Do you know how everybody talks
about you Glee guys?

37:36.313 --> 37:38.214
Oh, yeah, you get used
to all that.

37:38.281 --> 37:40.282
Finn, I'm, I'm
the new guy.

37:40.350 --> 37:42.852
That means I'm already on
the outside looking in.

37:42.919 --> 37:45.020
I don't want to start off
three touchdowns behind.

37:45.088 --> 37:47.690
I got to go.

37:47.757 --> 37:49.425
Coach Beiste makes us
do a hundred push-ups

37:49.492 --> 37:51.660
for every minute
we're late, so...

37:54.297 --> 37:55.731
Yeah, you made the
team, that's cool.

37:55.799 --> 37:56.699
Uh, what position?

37:56.766 --> 37:58.601
Quarterback.

38:05.008 --> 38:06.008
Excuse me, Sunshine.

38:06.076 --> 38:07.176
Hi, I'd like
to officially

38:07.244 --> 38:08.477
welcome you aboard

38:08.545 --> 38:09.979
and give you our Glee Club
fall rehearsal schedule.

38:10.046 --> 38:12.615
She won't be joining
your Glee Club.

38:12.682 --> 38:14.550
Oh, are you her dad?

38:14.618 --> 38:16.285
Her director.

38:16.353 --> 38:17.386
Dustin Goolsby,

38:17.454 --> 38:20.122
new coach of Vocal Adrenaline.

38:20.190 --> 38:22.625
Oh, and they gave me and my
mom a condo and a green card.

38:24.661 --> 38:26.262
- How did you even
find out about her?
- Hey, Will,

38:26.329 --> 38:27.830
I went ahead and made
that phone call.

38:27.898 --> 38:29.598
Should have gone along
with the poop cookies.

38:29.666 --> 38:32.034
I actually would have
stayed here, but I think

38:32.102 --> 38:34.036
Rachel would have made
my life a living hell.

38:34.104 --> 38:37.439
I just didn't trust her after
she sent me to a crack house.

38:37.507 --> 38:38.741
Not cool.

38:38.808 --> 38:40.042
It was nice to meet you.

39:00.163 --> 39:01.764
What did they say?

39:01.831 --> 39:05.367
Well, I talked 'em out
of giving you a "code red."

39:05.435 --> 39:08.037
They were pissed,
and they had the right to be.

39:08.104 --> 39:09.872
What you did
was bad, Rachel.

39:09.940 --> 39:12.074
We could have used Sunshine
to beat Vocal Adrenaline,

39:12.142 --> 39:14.009
and now they're just
that much stronger.

39:15.211 --> 39:16.512
Just do it already.
What?

39:16.579 --> 39:18.147
Break up with me.

39:18.214 --> 39:19.982
Okay, we both knew it was
just a matter of time.

39:20.050 --> 39:23.519
I think you're forgetting I'm
not the quarterback anymore.

39:23.586 --> 39:26.388
I'm just another Glee loser now.

39:26.456 --> 39:28.257
Fact is, you should be
breaking up with me.

39:32.629 --> 39:34.730
I'll never break up with you.

39:36.866 --> 39:38.867
Me, neither.

39:47.777 --> 39:50.245
I did it for the
team, you know.

39:50.313 --> 39:53.215
I just, I-I love
everybody so much,

39:53.283 --> 39:55.617
I didn't want anyone else
coming in and interfering.

39:55.685 --> 39:56.919
You got to stop
saying that, Rachel.

39:58.855 --> 40:00.322
I care about you
and everything,

40:00.390 --> 40:02.057
but you got
to admit the truth.

40:02.125 --> 40:04.460
You didn't do this
because you love Glee Club.

40:04.527 --> 40:06.729
You did it because you love
yourself more.

40:08.064 --> 40:10.132
Okay.

40:10.200 --> 40:12.234
I didn't want anyone else
hogging my spotlight.

40:12.302 --> 40:15.671
Okay, I love it too much
to let it go that easy.

40:19.342 --> 40:20.976
Do you think that
they'll ever forgive me?

40:21.044 --> 40:22.911
They'll come around.

40:24.147 --> 40:26.815
I think apologizing
would be a good start.

40:30.653 --> 40:32.588
Where are you going?

40:32.655 --> 40:34.223
The auditorium.

40:35.825 --> 40:38.594
I just need
some alone time first.

40:40.830 --> 40:45.601
âª Kiss today good-bye âª

40:47.637 --> 40:52.841
âª The sweetness and the sorrow âª

40:54.611 --> 40:56.178
âª Wish me luck âª

40:56.246 --> 41:04.720
âª The same to you âª

41:04.788 --> 41:08.023
âª But I can't regret âª

41:08.091 --> 41:11.460
âª What I did for love âª

41:11.528 --> 41:16.799
âª What I did
for love âª

41:18.635 --> 41:20.969
âª Look, my eyes âª

41:21.037 --> 41:24.540
âª Are dry âª

41:24.607 --> 41:27.142
âª The gift was ours âª

41:27.210 --> 41:31.747
âª To borrow âª

41:31.815 --> 41:36.385
âª Oh, it's as if we always âª

41:36.453 --> 41:40.856
âª Knew âª

41:40.924 --> 41:44.359
âª And I won't forget âª

41:44.427 --> 41:46.962
âª What I did for love âª

41:47.030 --> 41:54.336
âª What I did
for love âª

41:54.404 --> 41:58.540
âª Gone âª

41:58.608 --> 42:00.375
âª Love is âª

42:00.443 --> 42:05.013
âª Never gone âª

42:05.081 --> 42:07.182
âª As we travel âª

42:07.250 --> 42:11.653
âª On âª

42:11.721 --> 42:17.726
âª Love's what we'll remember âª

42:17.794 --> 42:20.195
âª Kiss today âª

42:20.263 --> 42:24.066
âª Good-bye âª

42:24.134 --> 42:26.235
âª And point me toward âª

42:26.302 --> 42:29.972
âª Tomorrow âª

42:30.039 --> 42:31.974
âª Oh, we did what âª

42:32.041 --> 42:38.981
âª We had to do... âª

42:39.048 --> 42:44.219
âª Oh, won't forget,
can't regret âª

42:44.287 --> 42:47.956
âª What I did for âª

42:48.024 --> 42:51.493
âª Love âª

42:51.561 --> 42:54.062
âª What I did for âª

42:54.130 --> 42:57.699
âª Love âª

42:57.767 --> 42:59.835
âª What I did âª

42:59.903 --> 43:02.971
âª For âª

43:03.039 --> 43:09.011
âª Love. âª

43:09.078 --> 43:15.751
