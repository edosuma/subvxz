for five straight weeks.

09:31.586 --> 09:34.827
And now a little Cole Porter.

09:39.379 --> 09:41.896
I'm sorry, I have to...

09:42.000 --> 09:44.241
[phone whooshes]Thank you, Oahu.

09:44.344 --> 09:45.965
There will be no encore.

09:49.137 --> 09:50.758
[sighs] Sorry we didn't
get to the fight.

09:50.862 --> 09:52.931
I know it was important to you.

09:53.034 --> 09:55.827
Well, at least it's
not an empty lot.

10:04.586 --> 10:07.103
Federal agents.

10:07.206 --> 10:09.310
Hello?

10:09.413 --> 10:11.379
Hey, Joe?

10:11.482 --> 10:14.000
Joe, you here?

10:16.482 --> 10:18.793
Seems pretty quiet to me.

10:21.655 --> 10:23.896
I got a problem.

10:29.586 --> 10:31.068
Can I ask you something?

10:31.172 --> 10:33.172
Yes. Please.

10:34.413 --> 10:35.620
Are you a grinder?

10:35.724 --> 10:37.379
[coughing]

10:37.482 --> 10:38.862
Excuse me?

10:38.965 --> 10:40.551
Well, you like a teeth grinder.

10:40.655 --> 10:43.206
I can give you some
tips for that, maybe

10:43.310 --> 10:44.793
recommend a night guard.

10:44.896 --> 10:46.413
[phone vibrates]Excuse me.

10:46.517 --> 10:48.034
Oh.

10:48.137 --> 10:49.517
Jesse, hi.

10:49.620 --> 10:51.103
Sorry to bother you, boss.

10:51.206 --> 10:52.551
We got a body.

10:52.655 --> 10:54.620
Looks like a robbery.

10:56.724 --> 10:59.000
Then why is the safe still full?

11:06.896 --> 11:08.689
[indistinct radio chatter]

11:08.793 --> 11:10.551
Victim is
38-year-old Nelson Carr,

11:10.655 --> 11:12.310
store clerk from Waimanalo.

11:12.413 --> 11:14.379
Keys were still in the door.

11:15.310 --> 11:17.068
It's likely he
was closing up

11:17.172 --> 11:18.586
for the night
when he got jumped,

11:18.689 --> 11:21.586
dragged to the back
and shot twice in the head.

11:21.689 --> 11:23.896
Okay, do we think Lucy's caller,
Joe, is responsible?

11:24.000 --> 11:26.517
He said he killed someone,
gave us the address.

11:26.620 --> 11:28.241
No sign of him
when we showed up.

11:28.344 --> 11:30.413
Forensics is still
working their magic.

11:30.517 --> 11:32.689
The safe was

11:32.793 --> 11:34.689
broken into
with an industrial drill.

11:34.793 --> 11:36.551
Someone knew
what they were doing.

11:36.655 --> 11:38.551
And yet the
safe was full.

11:38.655 --> 11:40.482
Yeah, over 80K in cash.

11:40.586 --> 11:41.827
Not to mention Rolexes,

11:41.931 --> 11:44.310
Piagets, and a limited edition

11:44.413 --> 11:45.965
pink gold Patek Philippe.

11:48.551 --> 11:49.586
I'm a watch guy.

11:50.241 --> 11:52.586
So the killers broke
into the safe,

11:52.689 --> 11:54.172
murdered the sales clerk

11:54.275 --> 11:56.000
and left without all the goods?

11:56.103 --> 11:57.482
MAN: What is going on?[woman screams]

11:57.586 --> 11:59.413
MAN: I need to get in there.WOMAN: Oh my God, Oh my God.

12:00.586 --> 12:01.896
I'm sorry, who are you?

12:02.000 --> 12:03.413
I'm-I'm Dennis Lang.
This is my store.

12:03.517 --> 12:06.000
Oh, my God.This is my girlfriend Nicole.

12:06.103 --> 12:08.758
Who's going to calm down now.
Okay, sweetie?

12:08.862 --> 12:11.413
The hell happened in here?

12:11.517 --> 12:13.862
We're not sure, Mr. Lang,
but it looks like Nelson Carr

12:13.965 --> 12:15.931
was the victim
of a robbery gone wrong.

12:16.034 --> 12:17.344
This is unbelievable.

12:17.448 --> 12:19.000
[sobbing]

12:20.000 --> 12:21.517
KAI:
We'll need an inventory

12:21.620 --> 12:22.793
to see if anything is missing.

12:22.896 --> 12:24.310
Nothing is missing.

12:24.965 --> 12:26.965
You didn't
take very long to look.

12:27.068 --> 12:28.793
I-It's all here.
They didn't take anything.

12:28.896 --> 12:31.000
Okay, we need
an inventory anyway.

12:31.103 --> 12:32.482
And we'll need to see
your security footage.

12:33.482 --> 12:34.448
Uh...

12:34.551 --> 12:36.206
Is that a problem, Mr. Lang?

12:36.310 --> 12:39.000
My cameras--
they're not working.

12:39.103 --> 12:41.620
They've been busted for a month.Doesn't seem

12:41.724 --> 12:43.965
very smart for a place
with high-end merchandise.

12:44.068 --> 12:46.896
No it doesn't, Dennis.Thank you, Nicole.

12:48.931 --> 12:49.896
It's humiliating.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.068
Look, why don't you guys

12:51.172 --> 12:52.517
go have a seat for now.

12:52.620 --> 12:54.758
HPD can collect statements.

12:56.344 --> 12:58.413
Let's take the
camera system anyway.

12:58.517 --> 13:01.241
And check and see if there's
other CCTV footage of the area.

13:01.344 --> 13:03.068
And if Ernie gets
an ID on Joe,

13:03.172 --> 13:05.137
head to his
last known residence.

13:05.241 --> 13:06.517
Okay.

13:06.620 --> 13:08.793
Oh, and, Jesse?Yeah.

13:08.896 --> 13:11.586
Please ask Heather not to
send me on a blind date again.

13:11.689 --> 13:13.172
That bad?

13:14.586 --> 13:16.793
[lock beeps, door opens]

13:18.241 --> 13:19.413
Oh.

13:19.517 --> 13:21.103
Better call
the fire department, Luce.

13:21.206 --> 13:23.448
There's a smoke show in here.

13:24.448 --> 13:25.448
[chuckles]

13:25.551 --> 13:27.344
So now you're
a comedy team?

13:27.448 --> 13:29.310
Just appreciating
your fancy duds.

13:29.413 --> 13:32.517
I came straight from my set
at the Royal Hawaiian.

13:32.620 --> 13:33.724
You play piano?

13:33.827 --> 13:35.275
And sings, too.

13:35.379 --> 13:37.551
Geez.I like to stay busy.

13:37.655 --> 13:39.517
Very busy. Speaking of which...

13:40.724 --> 13:42.000
I traced the
calls to a cell

13:42.103 --> 13:44.137
belonging to
Corporal Joseph Pitt.

13:44.241 --> 13:46.206
A former Marine
who worked in SSE--

13:46.310 --> 13:47.862
Sensitive Site Exploitation.

13:47.965 --> 13:49.586
He was trained
to extract intel,

13:49.689 --> 13:52.068
hard drives, valuables
in a hurry after raids.

13:52.172 --> 13:53.758
Basically he can
break into anything.

13:53.862 --> 13:55.586
Including a safe.Exactly.

13:55.689 --> 13:58.793
But Joe was medically retired
three years ago.

13:58.896 --> 14:00.034
What happened?

14:00.137 --> 14:01.896
Well, an explosion
during an op

14:02.000 --> 14:03.413
left him with
a traumatic brain injury.

14:03.517 --> 14:05.413
He suffers from
short-term memory loss

14:05.517 --> 14:07.586
and struggles with
high-functioning sequencing.

14:07.689 --> 14:10.068
That explains
the repetition and confusion.

14:10.172 --> 14:11.827
And his skillset
explains his involvement

14:11.931 --> 14:13.344
in the jewelry store break-in.

14:13.448 --> 14:15.103
On the plus side,
Joe clearly

14:15.206 --> 14:16.965
wants to be found.
I mean, he practically

14:17.068 --> 14:18.241
confessed to the murder.

14:18.344 --> 14:20.517
But he has
a severe brain injury.

14:20.620 --> 14:22.724
He may not know
what he's confessing to.

14:22.827 --> 14:24.172
Could you get his location
from the cell tower

14:24.275 --> 14:25.862
the call came from?

14:25.965 --> 14:27.517
Not a precise one.

14:27.620 --> 14:29.482
But he's hiding somewhere
near Diamond Head.

14:29.586 --> 14:32.206
I'll head out there. In the
meantime, send me his number,

14:32.310 --> 14:34.827
I'll keep trying him.

14:34.931 --> 14:37.310
Copy.
Forensics just confirmed

14:37.413 --> 14:39.551
Joe Pitt's fingerprints
were on the busted safe.

14:39.655 --> 14:42.448
Mm, given Joe's brain injury,
it's unlikely that he was alone.

14:42.551 --> 14:44.172
Boot prints suggest
there was at least

14:44.275 --> 14:45.689
one other suspect involved.

14:45.793 --> 14:47.620
All right, any insight
on what they were after?

14:47.724 --> 14:49.034
That's the headline, actually.

14:49.137 --> 14:51.689
There was traces of diamond dust
found in the safe.

14:51.793 --> 14:53.103
Diamond dust?

14:53.206 --> 14:54.551
That's what they use
to cut raw diamonds.

14:54.655 --> 14:55.931
Not something
that a retail store

14:56.034 --> 14:57.310
would be in the business
of doing.

14:57.413 --> 14:59.137
No, we didn't see
any raw diamonds in the safe.

14:59.241 --> 15:00.862
Maybe that's
what was stolen.

15:00.965 --> 15:02.586
And the only reason

15:02.689 --> 15:04.310
that Lang would lie
about something like that...

15:04.413 --> 15:06.068
Is if the diamonds were illegal.

15:06.172 --> 15:07.586
It's the perfect score
for a robbery.

15:07.689 --> 15:09.137
JESSE:
Ernie.

15:09.241 --> 15:12.241
Are you officiating a wedding?

15:12.344 --> 15:14.448
What? No.
But I am licensed to do so.

15:14.551 --> 15:17.724
Store cameras weren't broken
like Lang claimed.

15:17.827 --> 15:19.206
They were disabled.

15:19.310 --> 15:20.965
And it wasn't
the first time.

15:21.068 --> 15:22.310
Lang's been doing it
on the regular.

15:22.413 --> 15:24.379
That's shady.TENNANT: Get Lang in here.

15:24.482 --> 15:26.931
Let's find out about
his extracurricular activities.

15:29.103 --> 15:31.310
You look nice.

15:33.206 --> 15:35.689
Lucy Tara's phone.

15:35.793 --> 15:38.689
It's a lovely day for driving
around Diamond Head looking

15:38.793 --> 15:40.068
for a needle in a haystack.

15:40.172 --> 15:42.172
Well, I hate to disappoint,

15:42.275 --> 15:44.034
but Joe's apartment

15:44.137 --> 15:46.034
was the opposite
of a needle in a haystack.

15:46.137 --> 15:47.827
Whatever that is.

15:47.931 --> 15:49.103
Mostly empty?

15:49.206 --> 15:50.758
Yeah.
Yeah, a few personal items,

15:50.862 --> 15:52.172
a picture of Joe

15:52.275 --> 15:54.000
and a woman
that I just texted you

15:54.103 --> 15:56.620
and a brochure for New Dawn.

15:56.724 --> 15:58.103
Wait, what's New Dawn?

15:58.206 --> 16:00.413
It's a veteran's support group.
They, um,

16:00.517 --> 16:03.068
help vets sort through,
uh, challenges

16:03.172 --> 16:05.241
of coming back from combat and

16:05.344 --> 16:06.931
adjusting to civilian life.
That sort of thing.

16:07.034 --> 16:08.137
Oh.

16:08.241 --> 16:09.689
Sounds like you've been.

16:09.793 --> 16:11.206
No. No, never.

16:11.310 --> 16:13.172
Why? You think I...No.

16:13.275 --> 16:14.758
No, sorry, Kai,
I-I didn't mean...

16:14.862 --> 16:15.965
Someone invited me once

16:16.068 --> 16:18.655
after my last deployment, but...

16:19.620 --> 16:21.275
And you decided not to go.

16:21.379 --> 16:23.655
Yeah. Yeah, no,
I... I don't do that.

16:23.758 --> 16:25.413
Talk to people.

16:25.517 --> 16:28.379
Hey, um, did you see
that photo I sent you?

16:31.862 --> 16:34.689
Oh, looks like Joe
has a girlfriend, or

16:34.793 --> 16:37.000
had one. They look so happy.

16:37.103 --> 16:39.068
Yeah, it's the only photo
at his place.

16:39.172 --> 16:40.620
Clearly means a lot to him.

16:40.724 --> 16:43.896
Wait, that balcony--
that's nearby. The Marquess.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.413
The Old Marquess.
That's closed for construction.

16:46.517 --> 16:48.724
Makes it
a perfect place to hide.

16:48.827 --> 16:50.137
I'm go take a look.

16:50.241 --> 16:51.724
Oh, and hey, maybe

16:51.827 --> 16:53.655
you should, uh, you know...

16:53.758 --> 16:55.620
Go to the vets center,
check out New Dawn?

16:55.724 --> 16:57.827
Yeah. Talk to people.

16:57.931 --> 16:59.517
About the case.

16:59.620 --> 17:01.758
Yeah, sure.

17:01.862 --> 17:03.827
Be careful out there, Lucy.

17:08.344 --> 17:10.205
Strange way
of doing business, Dennis.

17:10.310 --> 17:12.413
You got security cameras
but won't use them.

17:12.517 --> 17:14.862
You got robbed but won't
say what was stolen.

17:14.964 --> 17:16.862
Seems all kinds of suspicious.

17:16.964 --> 17:18.448
I'll tell you what's suspicious.

17:18.550 --> 17:20.619
Ganging up
on an innocent shop owner

17:20.723 --> 17:22.827
when there's
a murderer out there.

17:22.931 --> 17:25.413
Tell us about the
diamonds, Dennis.[clears throat]

17:25.517 --> 17:26.896
The shady ones
that you've been cutting

17:27.000 --> 17:28.137
in the back of your store.

17:28.241 --> 17:29.965
First I'm hearing of it.

17:30.068 --> 17:32.103
Cut the crap or we'll assume

17:32.206 --> 17:33.724
you're directly involved
in the robbery

17:33.827 --> 17:35.034
that led to the homicide.

17:35.137 --> 17:36.413
I had nothing to do
with the robbery.

17:36.517 --> 17:38.344
Or the homicide.
I'm the victim here!

17:38.448 --> 17:41.103
Feels like Nelson
Carr's the victim.

17:42.103 --> 17:43.586
And if you don't
want to give us answers,

17:43.689 --> 17:45.413
we can come up
with some ourselves, like...

17:45.517 --> 17:48.137
Carr found out
about your illegal diamonds

17:48.241 --> 17:49.862
and then you killed him

17:49.965 --> 17:53.310
to keep him quiet.Okay, okay.

17:53.413 --> 17:55.586
It's not as bad
as you make it seem.

17:55.689 --> 17:57.620
Occasionally...

17:57.724 --> 18:00.172
I get involved
in the procurement,

18:00.275 --> 18:02.586
rehabilitation
and transportation

18:02.689 --> 18:04.586
of native gems.

18:05.551 --> 18:07.275
Black market
diamonds.

18:07.379 --> 18:09.103
Call it that, too.

18:10.620 --> 18:12.310
What was taken
from the safe?

18:12.413 --> 18:14.275
Bag of Brazilian raindrops.

18:14.379 --> 18:16.482
Diamonds I had already sold.

18:16.586 --> 18:18.172
How did Joe Pitt
know about them?

18:18.275 --> 18:19.655
No idea.

18:19.758 --> 18:20.896
Never heard of him.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.620
Who else knew about
the raindrops?

18:22.724 --> 18:25.000
I don't know.
A few people.

18:25.103 --> 18:27.103
Business people.

18:27.206 --> 18:30.206
People I now owe 800K to.

18:30.310 --> 18:31.827
You see my dilemma?

18:31.931 --> 18:33.862
And we sympathize.

18:35.172 --> 18:38.620
But you're gonna need
to get a lot more specific.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.206
[line ringing]

18:45.620 --> 18:48.206
[phone ringing in distance]

18:52.241 --> 18:54.448
Joe?

19:00.172 --> 19:01.862
[hangs up]

19:03.379 --> 19:05.586
[line ringing]

19:07.758 --> 19:10.241
You must be Joe.

19:15.793 --> 19:18.206
How do you know my name?I'm Lucy Tara.

19:18.310 --> 19:20.068
The NCIS agent you called.

19:20.172 --> 19:21.827
I don't remember calling you.

19:21.931 --> 19:23.344
Hey, it's okay.

19:23.448 --> 19:25.344
All right?
I'm here to help.

19:26.758 --> 19:29.241
That's a lot of blood on you.
Are you hurt?

19:29.344 --> 19:31.793
No. I-I... I don't think so.

19:31.896 --> 19:34.517
Maybe you shouldn't be here.
I'm dangerous.

19:35.448 --> 19:38.034
I'm not sure
I believe that, Joe.

19:38.137 --> 19:40.344
You don't know me.

19:41.310 --> 19:43.896
I know you go to New Dawn.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.931
Veterans support group.

19:46.034 --> 19:47.724
That you asked me for help.

19:47.827 --> 19:49.896
Said you wanted to tell the cops
everything that happened.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.275
I do.

19:51.379 --> 19:53.551
I just...
I-I just get so confused.

19:53.655 --> 19:56.172
You know, maybe, uh,
maybe this'll help,

19:56.275 --> 19:58.724
I found it in your apartment.

19:58.827 --> 20:00.965
Who is she?

20:01.068 --> 20:02.724
That's Marissa.

20:02.827 --> 20:05.448
My love. Did-did she reach out?

20:06.344 --> 20:08.206
No.

20:09.310 --> 20:11.724
But is she someone
we can call?

20:11.827 --> 20:14.000
Maybe help you remember
some things?

20:14.103 --> 20:15.896
No.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.965
She doesn't like it
when I call her anymore.

20:18.068 --> 20:19.931
Not since the accident.

20:20.034 --> 20:21.931
[car approaching]

20:23.724 --> 20:25.586
Listen, Joe, I want to help.

20:25.689 --> 20:27.413
But you have to give me the gun.

20:27.517 --> 20:30.034
Otherwise my associates
out there--

20:30.137 --> 20:32.103
they're gonna get the wrong
impression, that you're a danger

20:32.206 --> 20:35.482
to me and you're not, you're
not a danger to me, right?

20:35.586 --> 20:37.310
No.

20:37.413 --> 20:39.172
You called me for
the right reasons.

20:39.275 --> 20:41.965
You said you may have hurt
someone but you want to help.

20:43.724 --> 20:45.758
You're lying.
You're trying to manipulate me.

20:45.862 --> 20:47.379
Why does everybody
try and trick me?

20:47.482 --> 20:49.413
I'm-I'm not lying.
This is my boss.

20:49.517 --> 20:51.655
See? She knows that I'm here
and she's worried.

20:51.758 --> 20:52.931
So, I'm gonna answer it, okay?

20:53.034 --> 20:55.689
Ok-Okay.

20:56.689 --> 20:58.103
Hello.

20:58.206 --> 20:59.724
Lucy, you all right?

20:59.827 --> 21:01.896
I'm with Joe right now
and he's willing to cooperate.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.724
He just needs
to hand me his gun.

21:05.517 --> 21:08.000
Lucy, we are sending in HPD now
to assist.

21:08.103 --> 21:10.931
Actually, I think it's better
if you didn't. Think, uh...

21:11.034 --> 21:13.827
Joe'd be a lot more comfortable
talking to just me.

21:13.931 --> 21:16.551
Look, I don't think...And I'm not in any danger.

21:16.655 --> 21:19.172
Because Joe is gonna
hand me his gun.

21:19.275 --> 21:21.965
Right now.

21:30.344 --> 21:32.517
Thank you, Joe.

21:32.620 --> 21:34.827
Now that we have
that sorted out, we're gonna

21:34.931 --> 21:37.620
chat, just the two of us.
If you give me some time.

21:37.724 --> 21:39.724
All right, look,
I will give you

21:39.827 --> 21:41.758
as long as it takes
for me to get there.

21:41.862 --> 21:43.137
And I drive fast.

21:43.241 --> 21:45.344
Thank you, boss.

21:48.620 --> 21:50.965
Let's talk
about the jewelry store.

21:52.068 --> 21:53.586
We're at the dinner table,

21:53.689 --> 21:55.103
and Cousin Jimmy asks,

21:55.206 --> 21:57.034
"So what was it
like over there?

21:57.137 --> 21:59.689
You kill anyone?"

21:59.793 --> 22:02.827
Like he's saying,
"Mind passing the salt?"

22:02.931 --> 22:06.482
I get it,
he's-he's curious.

22:06.586 --> 22:08.379
No idea what to say to people

22:08.482 --> 22:10.206
like us who've come back
from war.

22:10.310 --> 22:13.137
Nobody gets it.

22:13.241 --> 22:14.965
Time passes, people stop asking.

22:15.068 --> 22:18.344
But that weight
is still there.

22:19.586 --> 22:21.965
Where do you put it?

22:22.068 --> 22:24.517
You put it here.

22:24.620 --> 22:27.862
We carry the weight
for each other.

22:31.241 --> 22:32.724
Welcome to New Dawn, brother.

22:32.827 --> 22:34.310
Have a seat.

22:34.413 --> 22:36.931
Actually, I'm...

22:37.034 --> 22:39.000
I'm not here to, uh...

22:39.103 --> 22:41.793
I'm looking to talk
to someone about Joe Pitt.

22:41.896 --> 22:43.931
Oh.

22:47.620 --> 22:50.448
I-I knew about
the TBI, obviously.

22:50.551 --> 22:52.448
I felt bad for the guy.

22:52.551 --> 22:54.758
So I invited him out bowling.

22:54.862 --> 22:56.965
And then, like clockwork,
he would call all the time.

22:57.068 --> 23:00.379
It was a lot,
but I wanted to help.

23:00.482 --> 23:02.517
Yeah, you were just trying
to be a good guy.

23:02.620 --> 23:04.275
I should have done more.

23:04.379 --> 23:05.793
But...

23:05.896 --> 23:07.206
it got hard.

23:07.310 --> 23:08.758
Hard how?

23:09.965 --> 23:12.482
Look, any informationyou have

23:12.586 --> 23:14.931
about Joe is gonna
be really helpful.

23:15.034 --> 23:17.103
The guy is in a bit
of trouble right now.

23:17.206 --> 23:18.551
You don't understand.

23:18.655 --> 23:21.724
Joe isthe trouble.

23:22.551 --> 23:24.413
What do you mean?

23:27.137 --> 23:28.448
He can get violent.

23:28.551 --> 23:30.448
One night at the bar,

23:30.551 --> 23:32.310
I stopped him
from smashing a bottle

23:32.413 --> 23:33.793
over some guy's head

23:33.896 --> 23:35.551
because he thought
he was laughing at him.

23:35.655 --> 23:37.620
And by the time we got outside

23:37.724 --> 23:40.068
he didn't even
remember it happened.

23:42.724 --> 23:45.517
I would tread lightly
if I were you.

23:47.379 --> 23:49.206
Whose blood is on you, Joe?

23:49.310 --> 23:51.517
Stop it.We know you were
at the jewelry store.

23:51.620 --> 23:52.827
You broke
into the safe.

23:52.931 --> 23:55.482
I broke into the safe
for the cause.

23:55.586 --> 23:58.034
What cause?No one was supposed to get hurt.

23:58.137 --> 23:59.448
Someone did.

23:59.551 --> 24:02.137
The store clerk.
He was beaten and he was shot.

24:02.241 --> 24:04.172
No. I-I didn't hurt him.

24:05.724 --> 24:07.827
It was Markus.

24:08.758 --> 24:11.103
Markus shot the store clerk?No.

24:11.206 --> 24:13.620
No, I-I shot Markus.

24:13.724 --> 24:15.413
[phone vibrates]

24:15.517 --> 24:17.896
So, is-is that
Markus' blood on you?

24:18.000 --> 24:19.862
He said everything
would be okay.

24:19.965 --> 24:22.137
Where is Markus now?
Can you show me?

24:22.241 --> 24:23.931
I think that I can.

24:24.034 --> 24:25.931
Okay.

24:26.034 --> 24:27.758
What's that?

24:27.862 --> 24:29.827
This-this is my boss,
remember? I have to get it.

24:29.931 --> 24:31.862
And then you can
take us to Markus.

24:31.965 --> 24:33.655
No, no, no, I...
the cops can't come.Okay...

24:33.758 --> 24:35.551
I won't remember.Okay, that's fine.

24:35.655 --> 24:37.172
I-I will handle it, okay?

24:39.586 --> 24:40.862
Hey.

24:40.965 --> 24:42.241
Lucy, time's up,
we're coming in.

24:42.344 --> 24:43.793
Wait, wait,
just-just hold on a second.

24:43.896 --> 24:45.413
Joe told me there's
someone else.

24:45.517 --> 24:47.206
At the jewelry store,
yeah, we know.

24:47.310 --> 24:48.517
Another body.

24:48.620 --> 24:50.310
Like a bodybody?

24:50.413 --> 24:52.000
Mm-hmm, and Joe is gonna

24:52.103 --> 24:54.000
take me to him right now
as long as we keep

24:54.103 --> 24:55.758
the cops away for just
a little bit longer,

24:55.862 --> 24:57.103
so his head stays clear.

24:57.206 --> 24:58.655
Okay, you think
that's the best plan?

24:58.758 --> 25:00.551
I think it's the only plan.

25:00.655 --> 25:02.413
Okay.

25:02.517 --> 25:04.517
Have him show you the body.

25:04.620 --> 25:06.586
And we'll stay
a safe distance behind.

25:06.689 --> 25:08.551
Lucy?

25:08.655 --> 25:11.275
You got this.

25:16.689 --> 25:18.068
So, uh,

25:18.172 --> 25:20.344
you and Markus,
y'all we're friends?

25:20.448 --> 25:21.931
No.

25:22.034 --> 25:25.379
But you went to the jewelry
store together for the cause?

25:25.482 --> 25:27.448
Yes.

25:27.551 --> 25:29.896
Remember who else was there?

25:31.827 --> 25:33.482
I made a... I made a promise.

25:33.586 --> 25:35.206
A promise to who-- to Markus?

25:35.310 --> 25:37.379
Do you want to see Markus
or talk about the store?

25:37.482 --> 25:39.586
I can't do both at once, okay?

25:39.689 --> 25:41.586
Okay, but maybe
take it down a notch.

25:42.827 --> 25:45.137
Sorry, Marissa.

25:45.965 --> 25:47.655
I'm sorry
for everything.

25:47.758 --> 25:49.344
Okay? You don't-you don't
deserve this.

25:49.448 --> 25:52.655
Joe, I'm not Marissa.

25:53.827 --> 25:56.000
I'm Lucy and we're looking
for Markus.

25:56.103 --> 25:57.413
Remember?

25:57.517 --> 25:59.241
Yeah. I-I know.

26:05.862 --> 26:07.482
We came down that path.

26:07.586 --> 26:09.413
You and Markus?

26:09.517 --> 26:12.137
Joe. Joe!

26:12.241 --> 26:13.655
One stop, he said.

26:13.758 --> 26:15.827
One stop and we go to the cops.

26:15.931 --> 26:17.275
You were gonna
go to the cops

26:17.379 --> 26:18.586
'cause of what happened
at the jewelry store?

26:18.689 --> 26:20.034
"I promise," he said.

26:20.137 --> 26:21.655
Then why do you
have your gun out?

26:21.758 --> 26:23.275
Joe, was he gonna hurt you?

26:23.379 --> 26:26.068
I don't believe you, Markus.
You're lying to me.

26:28.034 --> 26:30.758
No one was supposed
to get hurt.

26:32.379 --> 26:35.137
Nobody was supposed to get hurt!Joe. Hey...

26:39.413 --> 26:40.931
Joe!

26:42.103 --> 26:44.206
Wait, Joe!

26:50.034 --> 26:52.586
One minute on,
one minute off.

26:55.000 --> 26:57.034
You're mad, I can tell.

26:57.137 --> 26:58.586
No, I'm not mad.

26:58.689 --> 27:00.482
I'm just frustrated.

27:00.586 --> 27:02.172
Because
of the anniversary thing?

27:02.275 --> 27:04.448
'Cause we can celebrate
another night.

27:04.551 --> 27:06.241
I don't care
about the anniversary thing.

27:06.344 --> 27:09.586
You took a murderer into
a secluded area by yourself

27:09.689 --> 27:11.241
and he punched you
before running away.

27:11.344 --> 27:13.931
Technically, it was an elbow
and he didn't mean to do it.

27:14.034 --> 27:15.758
Why are you defending him?

27:15.862 --> 27:17.310
I think Joe is a victim here.

27:17.413 --> 27:18.827
[scoffs]Yes.

27:18.931 --> 27:20.275
He may have killed someone,
I think in self-defense.

27:20.379 --> 27:22.103
He's not capable
of planning a robbery

27:22.206 --> 27:24.344
and taking someone
to a beach to shoot them.

27:24.448 --> 27:25.965
He doesn't even know
what he had for lunch.

27:26.068 --> 27:27.310
I know you feel for the guy.

27:27.413 --> 27:30.206
I get it. But you heard
what Kai found out.

27:30.310 --> 27:33.034
Joe is no wallflower.
He's violent on a good day.

27:33.137 --> 27:35.517
He's impressionable,
easily confused.

27:35.620 --> 27:38.000
Someone took advantage of him
and now he's on the run.

27:38.103 --> 27:40.827
And I'm afraid that...Of what?

27:42.068 --> 27:44.137
He may do something
that he can't come back from.

27:44.241 --> 27:46.758
Well, I think
that ship has sailed, Lucy.

27:50.620 --> 27:52.275
Hope I'm not interrupting.

27:53.517 --> 27:55.000
I just spoke to
Joe's ex, Marissa.

27:55.103 --> 27:56.275
She's living in Arizona

27:56.379 --> 27:57.827
and hasn't spoken to him
in two years.

27:57.931 --> 27:59.931
Did he mention any
other family or friends?

28:00.034 --> 28:02.206
We only know about the people
from the support group.

28:02.310 --> 28:03.724
Ethan Denton.

28:03.827 --> 28:05.551
Maybe go back to him.
He may know where Joe's gone.

28:05.655 --> 28:07.413
If you're up for it.

28:10.551 --> 28:11.896
And take Whistler with you.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.344
And the ice pack.

28:13.448 --> 28:15.448
And the ice pack.

28:21.517 --> 28:23.482
Ah, how'd your set go
last night?

28:23.586 --> 28:27.241
Eh. I didn't get a lot
of love from the crowd.

28:27.344 --> 28:28.724
Ah, so that's
what you're looking for.

28:28.827 --> 28:30.344
Love from the crowd.

28:30.448 --> 28:32.448
[scoffs] I wouldn't say
I'm looking for it.

28:32.551 --> 28:34.275
It's just something to do.

28:35.482 --> 28:37.862
Why does it feel like
I'm being hobby-shamed today?

28:37.965 --> 28:39.172
No shaming.

28:39.275 --> 28:40.965
Just trying
to get a little insight

28:41.068 --> 28:42.793
into that big lovely
brain of yours.

28:42.896 --> 28:44.482
After all, I can't cut it open.

28:44.586 --> 28:47.793
I just figure the more
I put myself out there,

28:47.896 --> 28:49.965
in the world, the more likely

28:50.068 --> 28:52.758
I am to connect
to something I want.

28:52.862 --> 28:55.068
That's nice and vague.

28:56.275 --> 28:58.379
You ever think you're going
about it the wrong way?

28:58.482 --> 29:00.551
What?

29:00.655 --> 29:01.827
Connections.

29:01.931 --> 29:03.655
Too much work here.

29:03.758 --> 29:06.000
And not enough work there.

29:07.137 --> 29:08.931
Let's connect to the dead guy

29:09.034 --> 29:10.862
from the beach, shall we?

29:10.965 --> 29:13.241
Markus Stoller.

29:13.344 --> 29:15.275
Ex-felon with an
impressive rap sheet.

29:15.379 --> 29:16.724
Forensics

29:16.827 --> 29:18.793
confirmed his fingerprints
at the jewelry store.

29:18.896 --> 29:20.655
Shot once in the chest.

29:20.758 --> 29:22.413
Muzzle imprint
around the wound.

29:22.517 --> 29:23.793
And GSR on his hands suggest

29:23.896 --> 29:25.275
there was a struggle
for the gun.

29:25.379 --> 29:27.931
So Joe fought with Markus
before he killed him.

29:28.034 --> 29:30.068
Perhaps. Impossible to tell

29:30.172 --> 29:32.000
who was holding the gun
when it went off.

29:32.103 --> 29:33.758
Or which one of them
killed the store clerk.

29:33.862 --> 29:35.896
Well, actually,
it was neither.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.724
According to ballistics,
the clerk and Stoller

29:37.827 --> 29:39.620
weren't killed
with the same gun.

29:39.724 --> 29:41.482
So there's another gun.

29:41.586 --> 29:44.344
And likely another killer.

29:50.310 --> 29:51.862
What's that?

29:51.965 --> 29:53.241
Oh, nothing, nothing.

29:53.344 --> 29:55.551
It's, um, it's from New Dawn.

29:55.655 --> 29:56.724
The support group.

29:56.827 --> 29:57.724
Yeah.

29:57.827 --> 29:58.793
You should go to that.

29:58.896 --> 30:00.413
[chuckles]
No.

30:00.517 --> 30:03.379
No, that wasn't...Hey. You said you got info?

30:03.482 --> 30:05.586
Oh, I got info.
Ernie hit a dead end

30:05.689 --> 30:07.862
trying to find
Joe's connection to Lang's

30:07.965 --> 30:09.379
black market diamonds.This I know.

30:09.482 --> 30:11.206
But I found a connection
between Markus Stoller

30:11.310 --> 30:12.724
and Dennis Lang, or rather

30:12.827 --> 30:14.482
Lang's girlfriend Nicole.

30:14.586 --> 30:16.103
Blond, petite, weepy?

30:16.206 --> 30:18.137
That's the one.
So, Stoller

30:18.241 --> 30:20.344
and Nicole have worked
at the same telemarketing center

30:20.448 --> 30:22.793
in Waikiki
for the last six months.

30:22.896 --> 30:24.482
Well I doubt
that's just dumb luck.

30:25.551 --> 30:27.655
Maybe she told Stoller about
her boyfriend's side hustle?

30:27.758 --> 30:29.862
And that's how he knew when
and where to make a big score.

30:29.965 --> 30:31.551
Okay, you two track down Nicole.

30:31.655 --> 30:32.793
See how Joe fits in.

30:32.896 --> 30:34.137
All right.

30:34.241 --> 30:36.379
JESSE:
Ah, poor Jake.

30:36.482 --> 30:38.586
He's giving me
the cold shoulder over

30:38.689 --> 30:40.413
our camping trip.

30:40.517 --> 30:42.206
Hey, you know, I...

30:42.310 --> 30:45.206
I wasn't looking at that
New Dawn brochure for me.

30:45.310 --> 30:46.827
Okay.

30:46.931 --> 30:48.724
Why not?

30:48.827 --> 30:50.517
I-I don't think it's my thing.

30:50.620 --> 30:53.413
Look, everyone needs
someone to talk to.

30:53.517 --> 30:54.931
Yeah.

30:55.034 --> 30:57.620
[doorbell chimes]

30:57.724 --> 30:59.586
Not again.

30:59.689 --> 31:01.413
This is gonna be interesting.

31:01.517 --> 31:03.482
I told you everything.

31:03.586 --> 31:05.620
Not here for you.

31:06.896 --> 31:08.137
What do you mean?

31:08.241 --> 31:11.034
We know about your friend
at the call center.

31:13.241 --> 31:15.275
You've got to be kidding me.

31:15.379 --> 31:18.068
You... you don't understand.
I...

31:18.172 --> 31:20.551
I had no idea.

31:20.655 --> 31:23.379
He said he was going to kill me
if I said anything.

31:23.482 --> 31:25.137
Markus?

31:28.413 --> 31:30.103
Then who?

31:38.448 --> 31:39.689
I'll go talk
to the marina manager,

31:39.793 --> 31:41.137
find out which boat is Denton's.

31:41.241 --> 31:43.034
All right,
I'll take a look around.Okay.

31:53.103 --> 31:54.344
Ethan Denton?

31:55.689 --> 31:57.241
I'm Agent Tara with NCIS.

31:57.344 --> 32:00.103
Yeah, I spoke
to your colleague earlier.I know.

32:00.206 --> 32:03.034
Just, uh, have a few
more questions about Joe Pitt.

32:03.137 --> 32:05.310
I got a charter
leaving at sunset,

32:05.413 --> 32:08.137
but I can answer
some questions if...

32:08.241 --> 32:09.655
You mind helping me out?

32:09.758 --> 32:11.448
Yeah, sure.

32:13.551 --> 32:16.206
Still haven't found him, huh?No.

32:16.310 --> 32:19.551
And I'm afraid the situation's
become more urgent.

32:19.655 --> 32:22.827
Sounds like Joe's got himself
into some trouble.

32:22.931 --> 32:24.793
Well, we have reason to believe
that he may have fallen in

32:24.896 --> 32:26.310
with a bad crowd.

32:26.413 --> 32:29.068
People who manipulated him
into committing a crime.

32:32.448 --> 32:35.068
You mind, um, passing that down?

32:35.172 --> 32:37.275
Yeah. Sure.

32:41.068 --> 32:42.310
Here you go.

32:42.413 --> 32:43.620
Thank you.

32:52.586 --> 32:53.655
[sighs] So, uh,

32:53.758 --> 32:57.862
did Joe ever mention
a Markus Stoller?

32:57.965 --> 32:59.551
Hmm, doesn't sound familiar.

32:59.655 --> 33:03.206
Markus involved in this
robbery you're talking about?

33:04.931 --> 33:06.724
I never mentioned a robbery.

33:08.517 --> 33:11.000
[chuckles]
Didn't you?

33:12.655 --> 33:14.655
Looking for this, Ethan?

33:24.275 --> 33:27.482
Joe, it's Lucy. Remember?

33:27.586 --> 33:29.379
Yeah, I-I know.

33:29.482 --> 33:31.310
He was getting this gun
to kill you.

33:31.413 --> 33:33.827
Joe, you're confused.

33:33.931 --> 33:35.620
Shut up! You're a liar!

33:36.689 --> 33:37.862
Ethan was with you

33:37.965 --> 33:39.517
when you robbed the store,
wasn't he?

33:39.620 --> 33:43.172
Said I could help him
get his g-grandma's stuff back.

33:43.275 --> 33:45.827
Said that the store
owner had stolen it.

33:45.931 --> 33:47.103
No one would get hurt.

33:47.206 --> 33:48.379
That's insane.

33:48.482 --> 33:50.000
It was for the cause, right?

33:50.103 --> 33:52.620
Ethan shot the clerk?Yes.

33:52.724 --> 33:55.034
Said there couldn't
be any witnesses.

33:55.137 --> 33:57.206
He wanted Markus
to shoot me, too.

33:57.310 --> 33:58.827
ETHAN:
That's crazy.

33:58.931 --> 34:01.448
He's crazy.Then what are you
doing with these, Ethan?

34:01.551 --> 34:03.379
Stop lying!

34:03.482 --> 34:05.620
Hey, Joe, it's okay.
I believe you.

34:05.724 --> 34:07.172
I believe you, Joe. Okay?

34:07.275 --> 34:09.172
He tricked me.
And he made me into a murderer.

34:09.275 --> 34:10.896
That is not what you are.

34:11.000 --> 34:12.379
You are not a murderer.

34:12.482 --> 34:14.931
You were protecting yourself
from Markus.

34:15.034 --> 34:16.447
You were manipulated
into all of this.

34:16.551 --> 34:18.655
But if you pull that trigger
right now, that all changes.

34:18.757 --> 34:20.103
I-I just...

34:20.206 --> 34:22.068
Be the Joe I know you are.

34:22.172 --> 34:23.482
Okay?

34:23.585 --> 34:25.931
The Joe who called me
for help, remember?

34:26.034 --> 34:28.206
Okay.

34:28.931 --> 34:30.551
[grunting]

34:49.103 --> 34:50.310
[gunshots]

34:53.413 --> 34:55.482
I turn my head for one minute.

34:56.482 --> 34:57.620
Thanks.

34:59.241 --> 35:01.689
He-he said he brought
his grandmother's ring

35:01.793 --> 35:04.482
into the store so he
could pay for her surgery.

35:04.586 --> 35:07.724
Said the owner refused
to give it back.

35:07.827 --> 35:09.310
He needed that money.

35:09.413 --> 35:11.137
And he convinced you
to break in and get it back.

35:11.241 --> 35:13.379
He just wanted me to
help open the safe.

35:13.482 --> 35:15.965
Said we were getting his
ring back and that was it.

35:16.068 --> 35:19.172
And I believed him 'cause we're
always being taken advantage of.

35:19.275 --> 35:20.137
We?

35:20.241 --> 35:22.206
Vets like us.

35:23.689 --> 35:27.586
Joe, Ethan wasn't even a vet.

35:27.689 --> 35:30.344
He lied to you about everything.

35:32.517 --> 35:34.724
He was my only friend.

35:36.068 --> 35:39.620
What happened after Denton
shot the store clerk?

35:39.724 --> 35:42.275
Said we'd go to the police
to tell them everything.

35:42.379 --> 35:44.689
Instead, he took you
to the beach.

35:44.793 --> 35:47.896
I realized he was lying.

35:48.000 --> 35:49.862
He was gonna kill me.

35:49.965 --> 35:52.344
So... so I
went at him

35:52.448 --> 35:54.448
and we-we fought,

35:54.551 --> 35:57.206
and I-I shot him
before he could shoot me.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.413
I'm in a lot of trouble,
aren't I?

36:02.517 --> 36:05.137
Well, you'll have
to answer some questions,

36:05.241 --> 36:07.620
but we'll sort it out.

36:14.206 --> 36:16.206
It's gonna be okay.

36:16.310 --> 36:19.931
You helped us
and we're gonna help you.

36:20.034 --> 36:22.586
Thank you, Marissa.

36:24.827 --> 36:27.275
I knew you'd always
be there for me.

36:32.034 --> 36:35.551
Yeah. You're welcome, Joe.

36:39.137 --> 36:40.931
Take care of yourself, okay?

36:41.034 --> 36:42.896
Okay.

36:49.241 --> 36:50.965
Hey, you.

36:51.068 --> 36:53.724
Hey. Doing okay?

36:53.827 --> 36:57.344
Yeah. I'm just glad
you're all right.

36:58.379 --> 37:00.448
You were right
to believe in him, Lucy.

37:00.551 --> 37:02.931
You may have even
saved his life.

37:03.034 --> 37:05.241
I'm proud of you.

37:06.724 --> 37:09.482
Then why does it feel so bad?

37:20.413 --> 37:21.965
[knocking]

37:26.000 --> 37:27.000
I come in peace.

37:27.103 --> 37:28.344
Scott.

37:28.448 --> 37:30.137
And soufflé.

37:30.241 --> 37:32.758
I-I thought after my,
uh, abysmal performance

37:32.862 --> 37:35.103
last night, the least I could do
is bring you some chocolate.

37:35.206 --> 37:37.103
You talked to Heather.

37:37.206 --> 37:38.965
I did.
[chuckles]

37:39.068 --> 37:40.931
And I swear, I'm not here
to ask you out again.

37:41.034 --> 37:43.931
I just wanted to apologize

37:44.034 --> 37:45.379
for being such a snooze.

37:45.482 --> 37:48.172
Um... I get nervous

37:48.275 --> 37:50.586
and I talk about teeth.

37:50.689 --> 37:53.137
A lot.
It's a known problem.

37:53.241 --> 37:55.379
I'm sorry, too.

37:55.482 --> 37:57.137
Why? You were lovely.

37:57.241 --> 37:59.655
No, I could have
tried harder.

38:00.551 --> 38:02.896
I don't really date much,

38:03.000 --> 38:04.586
and I just...

38:04.689 --> 38:07.413
I wasn't in the headspace
for success.

38:07.517 --> 38:09.655
Well, no hard feelings.

38:09.758 --> 38:11.068
And hey,

38:11.172 --> 38:12.517
if you ever need a periodontist,

38:12.620 --> 38:14.275
I will give you
the friends and family rate.

38:14.379 --> 38:15.655
[laughs]

38:15.758 --> 38:17.379
Hey.

38:18.448 --> 38:20.034
Since you're here.

38:21.689 --> 38:23.482
It is a whole soufflé.

38:23.586 --> 38:25.000
I can't finish it myself.

38:25.103 --> 38:26.862
You sure?Yeah.

38:26.965 --> 38:28.896
And there's no rules
against being friends, right?

38:29.000 --> 38:32.551
Okay. But I warn you:
I grow on people.

38:32.655 --> 38:34.482
Kind of like plaque?

38:34.586 --> 38:36.620
[laughs]Hmm?

38:43.344 --> 38:45.103
All of them, Ernie.

38:45.206 --> 38:46.586
How could you even tell?

38:46.689 --> 38:48.379
I hear the buzzing.

38:53.034 --> 38:54.413
Now what do I do?

38:54.517 --> 38:56.724
You sit there with your own
thoughts and feelings.

38:56.827 --> 38:59.965
No other distractions. Got it?

39:00.068 --> 39:01.862
Yes. Fine. Good night.

39:06.310 --> 39:07.689
[exhales]

39:12.482 --> 39:13.586
Nope.

39:13.689 --> 39:16.758
[exhales]
Geez. Just...

39:16.862 --> 39:18.448
[grunts]

39:19.241 --> 39:21.448

39:24.448 --> 39:25.689
Hey.

39:25.793 --> 39:28.034
Next time you'll try for
a whole minute.

39:29.448 --> 39:31.034
Hungry?

39:32.448 --> 39:34.586
I hear there's a new Thai place
in Waimanalo

39:34.689 --> 39:36.413
that has a singing Elvis.

39:36.517 --> 39:38.689
Oh, yes, please.

39:38.793 --> 39:41.275
Jake, come on, buddy. Let's go.

39:41.379 --> 39:43.137
It's too late to go camping.

39:43.241 --> 39:44.448
I already unpacked.

39:44.551 --> 39:45.689
You kidding me? It's
a beautiful night.

39:45.793 --> 39:47.068
We got all the
time in the world.

39:47.172 --> 39:50.310
But it'll take hours
just to get to Peacock Flats.

39:58.137 --> 39:59.448

40:29.275 --> 40:31.620
I've never seen you
in here before, so,

40:31.724 --> 40:33.482
I'm thinking Delaware.

40:34.482 --> 40:37.000
Mm. You're close, actually.

40:37.103 --> 40:39.931
D.C. I'm just in town
for a meeting.

40:40.034 --> 40:41.689
Heard they do
a good burger here.

40:41.793 --> 40:43.068
Yeah, it's pretty good.

40:43.172 --> 40:45.448
Mmm, but their wings.

40:45.551 --> 40:47.448
That's their secret weapon.

40:48.413 --> 40:50.655
It's... it's kind of hard
to hear you.

40:50.758 --> 40:53.344
Do you want to sit closer?

40:53.448 --> 40:55.068
Sure.

40:55.896 --> 41:00.206
♪ Oh, it's always here
to break down all my walls ♪

41:00.310 --> 41:01.896
Mm.

41:02.000 --> 41:03.758
So, in D.C., I
go to this place

41:03.862 --> 41:05.241
called John's Hole in the Wall.

41:05.344 --> 41:07.448
Uh, supposedly,
where they planned Watergate.

41:07.551 --> 41:11.827
Double patty, double cheese,
smothered in Thousand Island.

41:12.758 --> 41:14.034
Huh, you don't seem like a

41:14.137 --> 41:16.206
"smothered in Thousand Island"
type of gal.

41:16.310 --> 41:19.620
Yeah. Well, you know, I don't
seem like a lot of things.

41:19.724 --> 41:21.275
[chuckles]Thank you.

41:21.379 --> 41:22.586
No.What?

41:22.689 --> 41:24.758
You didn't do that.What?

41:24.862 --> 41:26.000
You didn't eat my fries.

41:26.103 --> 41:27.517
It's too intimate.

41:27.620 --> 41:30.413
We sat here and
drank and flirted.

41:30.517 --> 41:33.724
You got me all worked up with
your Thousand Island comment.

41:33.827 --> 41:35.310
[laughs]

41:35.413 --> 41:37.206
Is what we're doing silly?

41:37.310 --> 41:38.965
No.

41:39.068 --> 41:40.896
We're reenacting
the first night we met.

41:41.000 --> 41:42.551
It is...

41:42.655 --> 41:44.724
It's the perfect
non-anniversary.

41:45.931 --> 41:48.586
♪ I don't know much... ♪

41:48.689 --> 41:51.034
Let's keep going.

41:56.344 --> 41:58.379

41:58.482 --> 42:00.758

42:02.517 --> 42:04.724
[laughing]

42:04.827 --> 42:06.620
RONNIE:Okay, that takes
care of old business.

42:06.724 --> 42:08.068
Uh, and thanks
again, Gary,

42:08.172 --> 42:09.275
for the malasadas.

42:09.379 --> 42:13.310
Now, we have a new member
with us tonight.

[clears throat]

42:15.103 --> 42:17.517
Hi. Um...

42:17.620 --> 42:20.172
Uh, my-my name is Kai.

42:21.068 --> 42:22.655
Uh, former staff sergeant

42:22.758 --> 42:26.068

Amphibious Battalion.

42:26.172 --> 42:28.241
Welcome, Kai.

42:28.344 --> 42:30.000
What brings you here tonight?

42:33.034 --> 42:35.275
It's time.

42:35.379 --> 42:37.586
It's time I talk to people.
