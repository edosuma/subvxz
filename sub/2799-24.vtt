00:21.029 --> 00:22.607
Get the paramedics.

00:22.673 --> 00:24.352
Hang in there, Jim, hang in there.

00:24.418 --> 00:26.231
Right here. Right here.

00:26.298 --> 00:28.411
Good job.

00:29.956 --> 00:32.103
Sir, sir, can you see me?

00:32.170 --> 00:34.385
Sir, can you hear me?

00:34.451 --> 00:36.096
Sir, stay with me. Sir?

00:36.164 --> 00:38.646
He's got a pulse of 120.

01:27.170 --> 01:28.440
55 year-old male,

01:28.509 --> 01:31.316
GSW left anterior chest,
entering at the level

01:31.382 --> 01:32.920
of the deltoid and AC joint.

01:32.987 --> 01:34.223
Minimally responsive.

01:34.291 --> 01:35.428
He's a cop.

01:35.494 --> 01:36.897
Tachycardic in the 120s,

01:36.963 --> 01:39.237
BP's 86 over 40 and dropping,

01:39.304 --> 01:41.411
02 stats in the 80s with
assisted ventilation...

01:42.681 --> 01:44.387
Okay, we're losing a lot of blood here.

01:44.453 --> 01:46.693
We need two large-bore IV's.

01:46.759 --> 01:48.766
Run the fluids wide, he's
extremely hypotensive.

01:48.832 --> 01:51.038
Absent breath sounds on the left.

01:51.105 --> 01:52.509
Likely pneumothorax.

01:52.576 --> 01:53.544
Let's put in a chest tube

01:53.612 --> 01:55.651
and pressors for that BP stat.

01:57.623 --> 01:59.094
He's in V-fib!

01:59.161 --> 02:01.167
Paddles!

02:09.389 --> 02:11.195
Three hundred!

02:11.263 --> 02:13.200
Clear!

02:14.247 --> 02:15.523
Come on. Come on!

02:15.590 --> 02:16.630
Come on.

02:17.671 --> 02:18.845
Three-sixty!

02:18.912 --> 02:20.624
Clear!

02:25.356 --> 02:29.159
I envy these parents who
live in ignorant bliss

02:29.226 --> 02:32.557
because I know how my
daughter, Ellie, lives.

02:32.625 --> 02:33.904
I know the company she keeps

02:33.972 --> 02:36.023
and I know what she does to get by.

02:36.091 --> 02:39.120
And... anyway, I mean,

02:39.187 --> 02:40.667
I'm... I'm... a couple of nights ago

02:40.734 --> 02:43.326
I'm in LA and sitting in my
car on Hollywood Boulevard

02:43.393 --> 02:46.792
watching her work a corner.

02:46.861 --> 02:48.710
And my eyes are playing tricks
on me because I don't see

02:48.777 --> 02:50.763
what she's doing, I see what she was.

02:50.830 --> 02:53.826
I see a little six year-old girl

02:53.893 --> 02:56.719
with a ponytail, playing with crayons...

03:00.897 --> 03:04.212
...singing a little tune to herself.

03:04.279 --> 03:06.823
It's... I don't know, all
I want to do is save her.

03:08.128 --> 03:09.801
But the thing is, you know,

03:09.869 --> 03:11.510
if something happened to me...

03:11.577 --> 03:15.057
I don't think Ellie would, uh... care.

03:16.665 --> 03:20.145
So I'm asking you to do me this favor.

03:20.213 --> 03:21.987
There's no one I trust
more with my life,

03:22.054 --> 03:24.732
or my death... than you.

03:26.641 --> 03:28.849
Captn Brass was shot twice.

03:28.916 --> 03:31.226
First bullet lodged in his vest.

03:31.294 --> 03:33.603
Second entered thrgh his
axilla, hit an artery,

03:33.671 --> 03:35.645
and is lodged near his heart.

03:35.713 --> 03:37.051
He's has internal hemorrhaging.

03:37.118 --> 03:38.324
Any neural damage?

03:38.390 --> 03:40.298
We won't know until
we stop the bleeding.

03:40.364 --> 03:42.104
If we stop it.

03:42.173 --> 03:43.846
Have next-of-kin
been notified?

03:45.295 --> 03:48.465
For medical purposes, I
have his power of attorney.

03:49.486 --> 03:51.810
You may have a decision to make.

03:51.810 --> 03:53.218
I'll let you know.

04:01.110 --> 04:03.613
Yeah.

04:03.680 --> 04:05.415
Okay.

04:07.871 --> 04:10.454
DB in Henderson on the train tracks.

04:12.062 --> 04:13.806
I'll take the first watch.

04:13.873 --> 04:15.316
You go work.

04:22.794 --> 04:24.905
I just spoke with McKeen.

04:24.972 --> 04:26.616
I heard it's bad.

04:26.682 --> 04:27.957
Pretty bad.

04:28.024 --> 04:30.807
They're trying to stabilize him.

04:30.874 --> 04:33.992
The last train passed
through here an hour ago.

04:34.059 --> 04:36.340
The engineer thought he saw a body

04:36.408 --> 04:37.815
on the track, but couldn't stop on time.

04:37.883 --> 04:41.269
He radioed dispatcher, who called 911.

04:41.305 --> 04:42.443
No ID.

04:42.509 --> 04:45.304
Probably decapitated by the train.

04:45.393 --> 04:47.238
Well, if scavengers nicked his clothes,

04:47.273 --> 04:49.081
they left a nice pair of riding boots.

04:49.149 --> 04:51.522
They probably didn't have
time to finish the job

04:51.557 --> 04:53.439
before other trains roared through here.

04:53.474 --> 04:55.252
Well, the engineer isn't
saying anything else

04:55.318 --> 04:56.714
until his union rep gets here,

04:56.714 --> 04:57.459
which... could be a while.

04:57.459 --> 04:58.470
I'll let you know.

04:58.539 --> 04:59.393
Great.

05:02.035 --> 05:04.323
You know, there's not a
lot of blood on the ground

05:04.359 --> 05:06.627
for a decapitation like this.

05:08.136 --> 05:10.533
Well, we don't know
how far he was dragged.

05:10.604 --> 05:11.802
Where's the head?

05:13.245 --> 05:14.546
I'll find it.

05:26.575 --> 05:27.603
Hey, Nick.

05:28.014 --> 05:29.384
Yeah?

05:29.455 --> 05:31.716
I think I found a toupee.

05:31.785 --> 05:33.703
Our vic may be bald.

05:33.772 --> 05:36.643
Thanks, that will help me
distinguish it from the other

05:36.679 --> 05:39.667
severed heads I find out here.

05:47.756 --> 05:49.367
Whoa.

05:53.068 --> 05:56.304
What a waist.

06:32.499 --> 06:35.151
David, are you getting the liver temp

06:35.220 --> 06:37.548
or performing acupuncture?

06:37.584 --> 06:40.313
Well, his liver's not
where it's supposed to be.

06:40.436 --> 06:42.491
Do you think this is
some kind of birth defect?

06:42.527 --> 06:44.466
What do you think?

06:44.502 --> 06:46.406
I think I feel fat.

06:46.474 --> 06:47.904
Yes.

06:47.971 --> 06:49.370
Got the liver.

06:50.316 --> 06:52.222
Suicide?

06:52.259 --> 06:53.647
A guy loses his shirt at the tables,

06:53.682 --> 06:56.871
decides to take a
permanent nap on the tracks.

07:02.457 --> 07:04.790
Well, he died with his boots on.

07:07.154 --> 07:09.301
You don't have to go
through the dude's mail.

07:09.348 --> 07:10.573
Name's Manny Rupert.

07:10.609 --> 07:11.764
He's a new tenant.

07:11.918 --> 07:13.822
Paid first and last in cash.

07:13.857 --> 07:15.692
We got a lot of party
people around here.

07:15.727 --> 07:17.492
You know, so there's
loud music every night,

07:17.527 --> 07:20.127
but this dude was pumping
tunes at 7:00 in the morning.

07:20.162 --> 07:22.191
You know, I knock on the door, I go in,

07:22.226 --> 07:24.704
that's when I see the dude
all laid out on the bed.

07:24.770 --> 07:27.433
Mm-hmm. Uh, figured I better
step out, call in the big guns.

07:27.883 --> 07:28.949
That's you.

07:29.571 --> 07:32.030
Um, listen...

07:32.065 --> 07:34.165
if my good citizenship is not
going to be appreciated here,

07:34.200 --> 07:36.276
maybe I just don't call
the next one in, you know?

07:36.311 --> 07:38.117
Just stay here and shut up.

07:38.152 --> 07:39.850
I'll be back to take your prints,

07:39.886 --> 07:41.946
assuming they're not
already in the system.

07:41.981 --> 07:45.736
Um... okay.

08:03.462 --> 08:07.136
Which of the seven deadly
sins are not represented here?

08:08.018 --> 08:09.657
Petecchial hemorrhaging.

08:09.724 --> 08:12.534
Could be from vomiting or asphyxiation.

08:13.112 --> 08:14.980
This guy was rolling on all cylinders.

08:15.015 --> 08:16.753
He was bound to throw a rod.

08:16.788 --> 08:18.456
Or somebody threw it for him.

08:18.491 --> 08:21.936
Pillow or a hand on the face
certainly could've done the trick.

08:22.878 --> 08:24.914
Well, based on the lack of rigor,

08:24.949 --> 08:26.915
TOD's three or four hours ago;

08:26.950 --> 08:29.389
tell you more after we
clean him up and open him up.

08:32.693 --> 08:34.361
Wallet's empty.

08:36.615 --> 08:38.888
You know what they say,
it's not a real party

08:38.923 --> 08:40.866
till somebody breaks something.

08:44.584 --> 08:47.001
I got blood.

08:51.348 --> 08:53.440
I got a noisemaker.

08:59.725 --> 09:01.781
Bullet holes.

09:01.930 --> 09:04.204
Somebody shot out the mirror.

09:04.371 --> 09:07.455
No apparent gunshot wounds on the vic.

09:07.522 --> 09:10.592
Let's get busy, boys.

11:37.985 --> 11:40.281
This man's organ were displaced.

11:40.317 --> 11:43.366
It's similar to the way a pregnant
woman's internal organs get

11:43.433 --> 11:46.579
re-arranged to compensate
for expanding uterus.

11:47.131 --> 11:49.485
Some of these blisters is fresh,

11:49.551 --> 11:51.636
but there's evidence of
scarring and irritation

11:51.703 --> 11:53.089
going back years.

11:53.124 --> 11:57.005
It all suggests a consistent
long-term pressure on the waist.

12:03.383 --> 12:06.637
So what, torture or self-inflicted?

12:06.673 --> 12:07.422
I don't know.

12:07.457 --> 12:10.566
But either way, it must
have been agonizing.

12:11.505 --> 12:15.511
I'm beginning to sense that
COD was not decapitation.

12:16.373 --> 12:19.006
There's a bullet hole...

12:19.073 --> 12:20.586
COD, shot to the head

12:20.654 --> 12:22.334
with this.

12:23.903 --> 12:25.284
It looks like lead.

12:25.319 --> 12:27.816
.44 caliber is my guess.

12:27.881 --> 12:29.888
That's a cannon.

12:32.455 --> 12:34.573
We managed to stop the bleeding,

12:34.641 --> 12:35.984
but his condition is critical.

12:36.019 --> 12:37.870
What are the options?

12:37.906 --> 12:41.147
We could try to remove the bullet.

12:41.183 --> 12:42.365
What are the risks?

12:42.400 --> 12:46.228
If we go in, the vertebral
arry could be impacted.

12:46.264 --> 12:49.591
He could bleed out or stroke out.

12:49.626 --> 12:52.563
Permanent incapacitation.

12:52.599 --> 12:54.077
And without surgery?

12:54.112 --> 12:56.418
The bullet could migte into the artery

12:56.453 --> 12:58.722
and, again, cause a stroke or kill him.

12:58.757 --> 13:02.928
Or it could stay there
for years and do nothing.

13:02.928 --> 13:06.440
He might never wake up.

13:06.482 --> 13:08.889
What are the odds?

13:08.925 --> 13:11.775
Mr. Grissom, this isn't a casino.

13:11.811 --> 13:13.891
I don't give odds.

13:13.926 --> 13:15.972
It's your call.

13:17.011 --> 13:18.604
Do it.

13:35.166 --> 13:36.175
<i>Hi, it's Ellie.</i>

13:36.211 --> 13:37.655
<i>You know the drill.</i>

13:38.279 --> 13:42.211
Ellie, this is Gil Grissom
from the Las Vegas Crime Lab.

13:42.247 --> 13:44.331
I'm a friend of your father's.

13:44.366 --> 13:49.651
<i>I'm sorry to have to tell you
this, but your dad's been shot.</i>

13:49.687 --> 13:52.349
<i>And his condition is serious.</i>

13:52.384 --> 13:55.088
<i>I think you should come and see him.</i>

13:55.123 --> 13:56.873
<i>It would help him a lot.</i>

13:56.908 --> 14:01.878
<i>Please call me
at 702-555-4141.</i>

14:07.268 --> 14:09.907
Why the residue on your
vic's so-called waist

14:09.974 --> 14:12.156
was topical cortisone,
prescription strength.

14:12.709 --> 14:13.771
The guy had an itch.

14:13.806 --> 14:15.418
He was doing more than scratching.

14:15.453 --> 14:17.820
Topical doesn't get absorbed
into the bloodstream.

14:17.856 --> 14:19.748
But Henry says that the guy's blood

14:19.783 --> 14:21.426
was flooded with cortisone.

14:21.461 --> 14:22.501
That makes sense,

14:22.537 --> 14:26.079
as much orthopedic
pain as the guy was in.

14:28.842 --> 14:30.755
You checking out my waist?

14:30.790 --> 14:32.542
I'm a 32-incher myself.

14:32.577 --> 14:34.016
Same as in college.

14:34.052 --> 14:35.422
Congratulations.

14:35.457 --> 14:37.229
Women aren't the only ones

14:37.264 --> 14:39.177
who feel the pressure to look good.

14:39.243 --> 14:40.837
Time was, having a rotund belly

14:40.873 --> 14:42.660
was a sign of prosperity and success.

14:42.695 --> 14:45.825
Now it just means you're a
lazy glutton, not getting any.

14:45.891 --> 14:47.395
Fibers.

14:48.063 --> 14:51.506
The fibers from the victim's long johns

14:51.542 --> 14:54.669
are consistent with the fibers
found in the burned-up clothes.

14:54.879 --> 14:56.817
Means those were the
clothes he was wearing.

14:56.884 --> 14:58.408
Raw wool, dyed grey.

14:58.443 --> 14:59.991
Did you get a manufacturer?

15:00.059 --> 15:01.081
No one from my database.

15:01.116 --> 15:04.271
But I did find
pomegranate berry extract,

15:04.306 --> 15:06.840
used to turn wool dye in the 1800s.

15:06.908 --> 15:09.480
Insect activity all over these fibers.

15:09.547 --> 15:11.451
Maybe moths or mites.

15:11.517 --> 15:12.520
Check it out.

15:14.458 --> 15:16.229
Means that the fabric was old.

15:18.268 --> 15:20.143
Vintage clothing, maybe?

15:20.178 --> 15:21.314
Maybe.

15:21.349 --> 15:23.317
Did you analyze the bone fragments?

15:23.352 --> 15:25.285
I'm only one highly-gifted person.

15:25.795 --> 15:27.390
I'll let you know.

15:28.201 --> 15:29.102
You been to the hospital?

15:29.137 --> 15:31.285
They're prepping him for surgery.

15:32.100 --> 15:34.049
I'll keep good thoughts.

15:34.512 --> 15:36.643
Mr. Party Till I Drop.

15:36.710 --> 15:39.050
His blood alcohol level was 0.28.

15:39.116 --> 15:40.552
Point two-eight?!

15:40.620 --> 15:42.457
That's barely conscious for most people.

15:42.524 --> 15:44.057
That's like falling-down drunk.

15:44.092 --> 15:45.590
Drunk just gets you in the door.

15:45.625 --> 15:47.606
We're also talking cocaine,

15:47.641 --> 15:50.042
opiates, barbiturates, methamphetamine,

15:50.109 --> 15:52.138
MDMA, THC.

15:52.173 --> 15:54.561
Serum was milky white
with triglycerides.

15:54.596 --> 15:55.534
Wow.

15:55.569 --> 15:59.356
If it was illegal, fun or
nasty, this guy was into it.

15:59.391 --> 16:00.250
Yeah, I'll say.

16:00.285 --> 16:03.484
I just analyzed the secretion
swabs you collected from his body.

16:03.519 --> 16:05.155
Was there enough for DNA?

16:05.190 --> 16:06.757
Oh, yeah. The donor's female.

16:06.792 --> 16:08.512
She's consistent with both
the blood from the mirror

16:08.547 --> 16:10.623
and the pubic hair
from the victim's mouth.

16:10.690 --> 16:13.030
And then I ran the
profile through CODIS,

16:13.096 --> 16:14.900
and you got really lucky.

16:14.967 --> 16:16.270
She's a local prostitute.

16:16.337 --> 16:17.340
She's in the system for a trick roll.

16:19.286 --> 16:22.361
There's evidence of sexual
activity in every orifice,

16:22.397 --> 16:23.738
including his ears.

16:23.773 --> 16:25.094
You joking?

16:25.129 --> 16:26.228
No.

16:26.263 --> 16:29.897
We've got pubic hairs,
vaginal secretions.

16:29.932 --> 16:32.074
Maybe he suffocated during oral sex.

16:32.140 --> 16:34.679
Would you care to move
on to stomach contents?

16:34.747 --> 16:36.485
Guess we're done with the appetizers.

16:36.552 --> 16:37.787
Well, the main course was

16:37.854 --> 16:40.059
enough alcohol and
cake to cater a wedding.

16:40.126 --> 16:43.367
Well, at least he
went out in style, hmm?

16:52.430 --> 16:53.862
Alone, maybe none of it

16:53.897 --> 16:56.029
would've been fatal,
but taken all together...

16:56.097 --> 16:58.503
Means he died with a smile on his face.

16:58.569 --> 17:00.306
Among other things.

17:02.984 --> 17:03.654
Hey.

17:03.689 --> 17:05.152
Just came from the hospital.

17:08.659 --> 17:09.669
Oh.

17:09.704 --> 17:11.567
No, no. Traffic fatality.

17:12.421 --> 17:12.935
Sorry.

17:23.662 --> 17:25.332
Where's McKeen?

17:25.398 --> 17:26.935
I sent him home.

17:28.145 --> 17:30.411
Just kidding. He went
to get something to eat.

17:32.215 --> 17:34.554
Brass just went into surgery.

17:39.358 --> 17:41.169
You two have known each
other for a long time.

17:42.681 --> 17:45.412
We've worked together ever
since he came from New Jersey.

17:45.447 --> 17:47.655
Just between you and me,

17:47.691 --> 17:49.830
does he always wear a suit?

17:49.865 --> 17:51.860
Like when you guys go to dinner,

17:51.927 --> 17:54.534
the movies or whatever it
is you do when you hang out.

17:54.601 --> 17:56.472
'Cause I got to tell you,

17:56.538 --> 18:00.255
thought of him in a sweater
kind of freaks me out.

18:01.821 --> 18:05.661
We don't "hang out," Greg.

18:05.727 --> 18:07.965
No kidding.

18:08.032 --> 18:09.469
I just assumed...

18:09.536 --> 18:11.105
What do you mean consent was given?

18:11.173 --> 18:13.144
Nobody has asked my
consent to do anything,

18:13.210 --> 18:14.414
and I'm his daughter.

18:14.480 --> 18:16.051
I understand you're upset, miss,

18:16.117 --> 18:17.689
but there's no need to take that tone.

18:17.755 --> 18:19.760
Look, I'm just here
to see my father, okay?

18:19.826 --> 18:20.462
He's a cop.

18:20.497 --> 18:22.122
He's in surgery.

18:22.157 --> 18:23.722
The only thing you can do right now

18:23.757 --> 18:26.059
is take a seat and
wait until he gets out.

18:26.095 --> 18:26.958
Excuse me, Ellie?

18:26.993 --> 18:27.835
What?

18:27.870 --> 18:29.616
I'm Gil Grissom.

18:29.683 --> 18:31.019
Thanks for coming.

18:32.035 --> 18:34.236
So I guess you're the
one who's in charge.

18:35.229 --> 18:36.999
How long is his surgery going to take?

18:37.066 --> 18:38.738
Probably a few hours.

18:40.576 --> 18:42.750
Look, I just got off a
bus, I would really like

18:42.785 --> 18:45.164
to take a shower and change
and maybe get a little rest.

18:45.199 --> 18:46.757
Do you have the keys to his house?

18:47.258 --> 18:48.228
No.

18:48.264 --> 18:51.133
Well, you're a cop, right?
How 'bout you just let me in?

18:53.018 --> 18:54.791
You know, there's a motel
just down the street.

18:54.826 --> 18:56.588
I'll get you a room.

18:56.623 --> 18:58.900
Do you want to check my arms?

18:58.985 --> 19:00.255
Go ahead.

19:00.321 --> 19:02.220
All right? It looks like Daddy
already told you all about me.

19:02.255 --> 19:05.140
I don't even know why
I bothered to come.

19:15.190 --> 19:16.726
How's it going?

19:16.793 --> 19:17.729
You okay?

19:17.796 --> 19:19.511
I'm okay.

19:21.825 --> 19:23.844
That's a... man in a corset.

19:23.910 --> 19:25.815
Corset-training.

19:25.882 --> 19:27.184
A venerable practice.

19:27.251 --> 19:28.689
Maybe for Scarlett O'Hara.

19:28.724 --> 19:30.693
Since when was it equal opportunity?

19:30.759 --> 19:32.615
In Victorian times, it was considered

19:32.650 --> 19:34.435
a staple of masculine attire.

19:34.934 --> 19:37.187
Students in British boarding schools

19:37.222 --> 19:39.441
were encouraged to lose an inch a year

19:39.476 --> 19:41.619
from the time they were 14 on.

19:41.947 --> 19:45.215
I guess I should feel comforted
that sadistic ideas of beauty

19:45.250 --> 19:46.797
aren't restricted to women.

19:48.668 --> 19:52.277
It's called a wasp-waist,
which is revealing.

19:52.914 --> 19:54.451
A wasp is from the insect group

19:54.486 --> 19:56.355
hymenoptera.

19:56.390 --> 19:59.259
The notion of hymen indicates virginity.

19:59.294 --> 20:02.668
In predacious wasps, the
genitalia no longer functions

20:02.734 --> 20:04.238
as a reproductive organ.

20:04.305 --> 20:05.708
It's used as a stinger.

20:06.413 --> 20:08.648
Go in for sex and get stung.

20:08.715 --> 20:11.120
Pretty much every man's fear.

20:15.168 --> 20:17.769
The victim was shot,

20:17.837 --> 20:19.708
body dumped, clothes burned.

20:20.151 --> 20:21.479
The corset, too.

20:21.514 --> 20:22.995
The bone fragments that Nick found

20:23.030 --> 20:24.440
at the crime scene re whalebone,

20:24.475 --> 20:26.658
which is what they used
to make corsets out of.

20:27.296 --> 20:29.564
Where did you learn
so much about corsets?

20:31.035 --> 20:32.647
I have my sources.

20:39.487 --> 20:42.048
The embroidery is Chinese, silk.

20:42.083 --> 20:46.402
The lace is made from
hand-tatted linen thread.

20:46.437 --> 20:48.540
Ribs are pure whalebone.

20:48.575 --> 20:50.513
They don't make them like this anymore.

20:51.506 --> 20:53.386
I'm sure the whales appreciate that.

20:53.990 --> 20:55.124
How many, if any,

20:55.190 --> 20:56.393
do you sell to men?

20:56.594 --> 20:58.098
More than you'd think.

20:58.165 --> 21:01.409
Many men with back problems
have remarked how much better

21:01.444 --> 21:04.045
a boned-tabbed Elizabethan corset feels

21:04.112 --> 21:06.517
than a steel back brace.

21:07.566 --> 21:10.994
Let's focus on your customers
that don't have back problems.

21:11.061 --> 21:13.889
Ms. Sidle, people's private
lives are their own business.

21:13.924 --> 21:14.540
I don't want to...

21:14.576 --> 21:17.714
Mr. Phillipe, I have a dead
man with a 19-inch waist

21:17.749 --> 21:19.009
and no way to identify him.

21:19.044 --> 21:21.854
Any help at all would be appreciated.

21:21.920 --> 21:23.090
Do you have a picture?

21:23.245 --> 21:24.693
I have a head shot.

21:34.183 --> 21:35.408
Oh, my God, that's, uh,

21:35.443 --> 21:37.432
that's Caleb Carson. He comes in

21:37.467 --> 21:41.729
once a year for a
re-stitch and reinforcement.

21:41.764 --> 21:44.841
Is he into pain, masochism?

21:44.908 --> 21:45.962
I don't know.

21:45.997 --> 21:48.259
How about cross-dressing?

21:48.294 --> 21:50.520
I seriously doubt that.

21:50.587 --> 21:51.522
How come?

21:51.966 --> 21:54.362
Mr. Carson never spoke much,

21:54.429 --> 21:58.139
but he was the type of man who,
when he came into the store,

21:58.206 --> 22:01.412
if I were sitting down,
I'd immediately stand up.

22:02.035 --> 22:03.393
He treated me like a servant.

22:03.428 --> 22:04.859
And, truth be told,

22:05.586 --> 22:07.697
he actually made me feel like one.

22:08.722 --> 22:11.102
I'm going to need his address.

22:29.144 --> 22:31.350
Colonel Caleb "C.C." Carson.

22:31.449 --> 22:33.554
1864.

22:35.365 --> 22:36.870
Resembles the victim.

22:36.905 --> 22:38.900
At least from the neck up.

22:40.850 --> 22:43.210
These are Civil War-era photos.

22:43.789 --> 22:46.503
They didn't smile much back then.

22:46.686 --> 22:50.025
Subjects had to hold completely
still for five minutes.

22:50.060 --> 22:52.032
Otherwise, the exposure would blur.

22:52.067 --> 22:53.768
It hurt to hold a smile.

22:54.805 --> 22:56.775
Bet these hurt more.

23:01.760 --> 23:04.560
It's the same caliber killed the vic.

23:04.627 --> 23:06.631
They don't make 'em like they used to.

23:37.937 --> 23:39.957
Warrick just called from the hospital.

23:39.992 --> 23:41.784
They got the bullet.

23:42.010 --> 23:43.514
How's he doing?

23:44.371 --> 23:47.094
He hasn't regained consciousness yet.

23:49.781 --> 23:53.376
This fellow seems to have lost his way.

23:54.491 --> 23:56.650
Is this Gettysburg?

23:56.716 --> 23:58.687
You into military history?

23:58.722 --> 23:59.776
My dad was.

23:59.811 --> 24:03.599
Used to spend the summer
touring Pennsylvania in an RV,

24:03.666 --> 24:05.469
so I could learn things.

24:05.536 --> 24:07.441
You were a lucky girl.

24:09.125 --> 24:11.617
Pickett's Charge, I think.

24:11.751 --> 24:12.538
The Confederates advanced

24:12.573 --> 24:15.468
from this position to Cemetery Ridge.

24:15.760 --> 24:17.656
They marched to their doom,

24:17.691 --> 24:19.967
but kept their honor.

24:20.172 --> 24:21.812
Carson obviously

24:21.847 --> 24:24.348
was a Son of the South.

24:31.497 --> 24:33.316
Looks comfortable.

24:34.156 --> 24:37.055
Well, he was into
discipline and self-denial.

24:37.090 --> 24:39.864
This corset ties from
the back, which means Mr.

24:39.899 --> 24:42.637
Carson couldn't have
tied the laces by himself.

24:43.368 --> 24:45.297
He had to have help.

24:58.584 --> 25:00.724
Seems to run in the family.

25:08.639 --> 25:10.068
Oh, I don't really know. I...

25:10.103 --> 25:10.994
You know what?

25:11.029 --> 25:12.436
Let me call you back.

25:12.960 --> 25:14.532
Ellie?

25:15.569 --> 25:17.125
Hey.

25:17.449 --> 25:19.343
You know your father's out of surgery.

25:19.411 --> 25:20.716
Yeah. How's he doing?

25:20.751 --> 25:23.285
It's a little too early
to tell, but I know

25:23.286 --> 25:25.525
when he wakes up, he'll
be happy to see you.

25:25.592 --> 25:26.386
You think so?

25:26.421 --> 25:28.449
I know so. You look good.

25:28.484 --> 25:30.717
Yeah, you mean, I don't look
like a crack whore anymore?

25:30.752 --> 25:33.617
That's not what I meant, but no.

25:36.232 --> 25:38.343
Does he ever talk about me?

25:41.462 --> 25:43.288
That's a no.

25:43.891 --> 25:46.574
Look, what do you want me to say, hmm?

25:46.641 --> 25:49.471
It's not really about
you right now, okay?

25:49.506 --> 25:52.301
But the fact that you're
here is saying a lot.

25:53.239 --> 25:56.965
Yeah, well, thanks for
clearing that up for me.

26:03.337 --> 26:06.942
Remember that trick roll
that you pled out last year?

26:06.977 --> 26:09.358
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

26:09.393 --> 26:11.704
Your DNA in our database
says that you do.

26:11.739 --> 26:14.651
We found your blood in
Manny Rupert's apartment,

26:14.686 --> 26:16.609
with him lying there dead.

26:18.077 --> 26:20.821
If you Belushi'd the guy,

26:20.887 --> 26:22.547
maybe you didn't mean to.

26:22.582 --> 26:24.551
Now would be the time to say it.

26:24.586 --> 26:26.695
Look, I'm the victim here.

26:26.730 --> 26:28.805
Funny, you don't look dead.

26:30.834 --> 26:32.662
Look, the whole night
started out normal, okay?

26:32.697 --> 26:34.870
I mean, he paid for everything.

26:34.906 --> 26:36.389
He was kind of fun.

26:36.791 --> 26:38.317
And he was up for anything.

26:38.352 --> 26:41.568
I mean, there was
champagne, E, coke, cake.

26:42.343 --> 26:44.247
And he wasn't even bad-looking.

26:45.613 --> 26:47.586
So, how did it go so bad?

26:47.621 --> 26:51.426
Well, usually, a guy is
good for maybe one or two.

26:51.492 --> 26:54.701
This guy wanted more after
six, if you know what I mean.

26:55.234 --> 26:56.821
No "off" switch?

26:56.856 --> 26:58.409
No, not even close.

26:58.811 --> 26:59.725
It's getting kind of late.

26:59.760 --> 27:00.992
No, look, you're not...
you're not going anywhere!

27:01.027 --> 27:02.577
Okay, honey, you need to get some rest.

27:02.613 --> 27:05.024
No. I paid for the whole night!

27:06.929 --> 27:07.877
Son of a... Ow. Ouch. Ow.

27:07.992 --> 27:11.139
He was whacked out, but
he was alive when I bolted.

27:11.174 --> 27:14.251
Well, that's a great
story, but it doesn't sound

27:14.286 --> 27:17.092
like it was worth the ten G's
that we found in your purse.

27:17.128 --> 27:19.105
I earned that money.

27:19.140 --> 27:20.556
Don't take it personally,

27:20.591 --> 27:23.996
but you are not a
$10,000-a-night girl.

27:25.456 --> 27:27.510
Are you finished processing those prints

27:27.511 --> 27:29.181
from Manny Rupert's apartment?

27:29.248 --> 27:30.296
Does it look like I have?

27:30.332 --> 27:32.707
So far, the decedent's
prints are everywhere.

27:32.742 --> 27:37.385
Got them on liquor bottles, drug
paraphernalia, the gun, the dishes.

27:37.420 --> 27:39.237
Are you looking for
something in particular?

27:39.272 --> 27:41.649
We're looking for anything
the hooker might have touched.

27:41.684 --> 27:43.651
We're thinking she might
have slipped him something

27:43.686 --> 27:46.058
that pushed him over the edge.

27:47.518 --> 27:49.663
I got her prints off of the bedpost,

27:49.729 --> 27:51.032
the chair, and a soda can.

27:51.098 --> 27:53.472
She didn't touch the booze or pills.

27:53.538 --> 27:55.577
Maybe she's in AA.

27:56.305 --> 27:58.711
Maybe she's not a killer.

28:00.721 --> 28:02.927
I just can't believe it.

28:03.481 --> 28:06.500
I've been with Mr. Carson for years.

28:06.643 --> 28:08.139
How do you mean?

28:08.552 --> 28:10.182
Nothing like that.

28:10.217 --> 28:11.813
I was his driver.

28:11.848 --> 28:14.621
I take it you got my
fingerprints from my work card?

28:14.933 --> 28:15.508
That's right.

28:15.544 --> 28:18.240
They were on one of
Mr. Carson's corsets.

28:18.275 --> 28:21.095
I was also Mr. Carson's dresser.

28:21.130 --> 28:23.008
What did that entail?

28:23.073 --> 28:24.465
In the 19th century,

28:24.501 --> 28:26.654
a dresser's job was to
help gentleman soldiers

28:26.689 --> 28:28.315
with their equipment.

28:28.351 --> 28:31.858
So you dressed him in Rebel drag.

28:31.893 --> 28:34.601
If you're asking, did I lace his corset,

28:34.668 --> 28:36.839
of course.

28:36.917 --> 28:38.517
Every morning.

28:38.552 --> 28:40.258
Did it hurt?

28:40.294 --> 28:41.929
Absolutely.

28:41.964 --> 28:44.658
But he controlled the pain.

28:45.755 --> 28:48.135
When was the last time you saw him?

28:48.170 --> 28:49.886
Yesterday morning.

28:49.921 --> 28:51.052
At the house.

28:51.087 --> 28:52.644
No.

28:53.283 --> 28:54.910
At a duel.

28:54.945 --> 28:56.538
A duel?

28:56.970 --> 28:58.658
Where?

28:59.041 --> 29:01.290
Gettysburg.

29:18.786 --> 29:21.723
If all you do is Civil War recreations,

29:21.758 --> 29:24.224
why were you and Caleb
Carson having a duel?

29:24.259 --> 29:27.011
Ugh! Apparently, I offended him.

29:27.491 --> 29:30.259
Honey, I'm right in the
middle of Cemetery Ridge here.

29:30.294 --> 29:31.853
I care what we have for dinner.

29:32.193 --> 29:33.643
Well, check the cupboards...

29:33.678 --> 29:34.753
Sir!

29:34.788 --> 29:35.827
You dishonor the dead.

29:35.862 --> 29:38.764
Damn it, Caleb, that was
my wife I was talking to.

29:38.799 --> 29:40.915
My great-great
grandfather spilled blood

29:40.950 --> 29:41.999
on this hallowed ground.

29:42.034 --> 29:43.048
Oh, really?

29:43.083 --> 29:45.281
I didn't know Gettysburg was in Nevada.

29:45.316 --> 29:48.141
I demand satisfaction.

29:48.847 --> 29:51.780
I challenge you to a duel, sir!

29:54.584 --> 29:57.492
Okay. Fine.

29:57.888 --> 29:58.886
Let's do it.

29:58.921 --> 30:01.142
I'd never reenacted a duel, so, uh,

30:01.177 --> 30:04.003
we agreed to meet on the field
of honor with our pistols.

30:04.038 --> 30:05.201
And real bullets?

30:05.236 --> 30:06.947
No, no, not in my gun.

30:06.982 --> 30:09.342
No, I figured we were just
going to blast some powder

30:09.377 --> 30:11.196
and then go out for pancakes.

30:11.231 --> 30:14.152
Caleb wanted a little more authenticity.

30:14.187 --> 30:16.173
Guns at the ready and...

30:16.208 --> 30:17.304
one, two,

30:17.339 --> 30:19.112
three, four, five,

30:19.147 --> 30:20.886
six, seven, eight,

30:20.921 --> 30:22.615
nine, ten.

30:26.214 --> 30:28.562
But this isn't a recreation, you know.

30:28.597 --> 30:30.449
He really shot me.

30:30.484 --> 30:31.654
Almost nicked the bone.

30:31.689 --> 30:33.881
It's a good thing my second was there.

30:34.818 --> 30:36.754
He's a male nurse.

30:38.291 --> 30:41.693
A man shoots you, and
you don't call the police?

30:41.728 --> 30:45.095
He shot me 'cause I was
taking a cell phone call.

30:45.675 --> 30:48.457
What do you think he was going
to do if went to the cops?

30:48.492 --> 30:50.064
When that bullet hit me,

30:50.370 --> 30:51.341
I ran for my life.

30:51.376 --> 30:53.766
I jumped in my car and
got the heck out of here.

30:54.263 --> 30:55.832
What about him?

30:56.130 --> 30:58.538
Oh, we-we carpool.

30:59.574 --> 31:01.023
Colt 44?

31:01.059 --> 31:02.474
Yeah.

31:02.955 --> 31:04.976
Is that your dueling pistol?

31:06.112 --> 31:08.228
We're going to have
to take that with us.

31:08.296 --> 31:09.335
Why?

31:09.370 --> 31:12.466
I, too, demand satisfaction.

31:17.250 --> 31:18.553
Ready?

31:18.919 --> 31:19.934
Ready.

31:19.969 --> 31:22.729
One, two, three,

31:22.764 --> 31:24.913
four, five, six,

31:24.948 --> 31:26.886
seven, eight,

31:26.921 --> 31:28.826
nine, ten.

31:37.240 --> 31:38.965
I got blood drops.

31:39.001 --> 31:41.237
Heading way from Mr. Carson.

31:41.272 --> 31:43.349
Consistent with the duelist's story.

31:50.153 --> 31:52.650
I got something here, too.

31:52.685 --> 31:55.117
This could be the blood
that we didn't find

31:55.152 --> 31:57.551
at the train tracks...
It's a lot of blood.

31:58.887 --> 32:01.058
Maybe Carson was killed here.

32:12.475 --> 32:14.350
Yeah, she's here.

32:14.385 --> 32:15.617
Been drinking a ton of coffee

32:15.652 --> 32:18.637
and going outside for
smokes; on her cell.

32:18.673 --> 32:21.633
Not real sociable, you know?

32:21.701 --> 32:23.126
You want me to keep an eye on her?

32:23.161 --> 32:24.551
<i>It sounds like you already are.</i>

32:24.586 --> 32:27.347
Nah. I'm off the clock.

32:27.414 --> 32:28.960
I'll stick around for awhile,

32:28.995 --> 32:30.289
let you know if there's any change.

32:30.324 --> 32:31.783
Thank you, Nick.

32:31.900 --> 32:34.233
Did you compare the bullet
from the victim to this pistol?

32:34.268 --> 32:36.374
Uh, no, not yet, but, boss,

32:36.409 --> 32:38.798
I don't think that's your murder weapon.

32:38.833 --> 32:40.447
And you know this how?

32:40.482 --> 32:43.463
Uh, here, I'll let Hawkeye show you.

32:50.328 --> 32:51.493
What is that?

32:51.529 --> 32:53.209
Well, Hodges will have to confirm,

32:53.244 --> 32:55.052
but I'm pretty certain

32:55.087 --> 32:56.861
it's cream of wheat.

32:58.373 --> 33:00.929
So he's a cereal killer.

33:01.193 --> 33:02.846
Snap, crackle and pop.

33:02.881 --> 33:05.190
Uh, the dried powdered
wheat particles actually

33:05.225 --> 33:07.627
augments the smoke, and, uh,

33:07.662 --> 33:11.071
seals the gunpowder in the cylinder.

33:11.106 --> 33:14.337
Which would be perfect
for Civil War reenactments.

33:14.372 --> 33:15.483
Yeah. I don't think

33:15.518 --> 33:19.729
that Colt's fired a real
bullet in quite a while.

33:26.953 --> 33:29.709
Miss Rupert, as far as we can tell,

33:29.744 --> 33:32.467
your brother died from diabetic shock.

33:32.533 --> 33:35.072
What? How?

33:35.139 --> 33:37.109
Well, it seems that he went on a bender.

33:37.323 --> 33:40.249
He consumed a great
deal of alcohol, sugar

33:40.284 --> 33:42.824
and narcotics.

33:42.891 --> 33:44.510
Did he party like this a lot?

33:44.545 --> 33:46.719
No. No.

33:46.754 --> 33:49.058
He was just diagnosed as pre-diabetic.

33:49.515 --> 33:52.609
So he was aware of his condition.

33:52.644 --> 33:54.300
Yeah.

33:54.335 --> 33:56.920
Do you like that this was self-induced?

33:59.045 --> 34:00.887
You know, our family has a history

34:00.922 --> 34:02.695
of heart disease and diabetes.

34:02.731 --> 34:05.557
Both our parents died of
heart attacks in their 40s.

34:05.592 --> 34:07.537
Two of our grandparents, too.

34:07.572 --> 34:09.447
Well, Manny turned 40 last week

34:09.482 --> 34:11.400
and he acted like it
was a death sentence.

34:11.436 --> 34:13.565
You know, but he... he always said,

34:13.600 --> 34:16.636
"You can't fight bad genes. "

34:16.703 --> 34:19.907
You know, he had a
vasectomy when he was 22.

34:20.293 --> 34:23.217
Never got married, just
didn't see the point.

34:23.253 --> 34:25.688
So he just... gave up?

34:25.723 --> 34:28.196
He quit?

34:28.263 --> 34:29.784
You don't know what it's like

34:29.820 --> 34:32.989
to live with a death sentence
hanging over your head.

34:34.271 --> 34:37.485
No. You're right, I don't.

34:38.663 --> 34:41.739
But I've seen what it's
like to not have a choice.

34:41.774 --> 34:44.001
And he did.

34:44.067 --> 34:46.045
He could have fought it,
but he just chose not to.

34:46.080 --> 34:49.886
You know, I just lost my
brother, and you're judging him?

34:49.920 --> 34:51.958
How dare you.

34:54.105 --> 34:56.833
I'm-I'm so very sorry for your loss.

35:08.893 --> 35:10.375
Am I interrupting?

35:10.410 --> 35:11.111
No.

35:11.146 --> 35:15.815
I just got a heads up from
a friend in payroll at PERS.

35:15.850 --> 35:19.278
Ellie Brass just called
about Jim's pension.

35:19.313 --> 35:21.375
She wanted to know how much there was

35:21.410 --> 35:23.372
and was she a beneficiary.

35:23.407 --> 35:26.700
This girl is circling like a vulture.

35:27.243 --> 35:30.810
Jim doesn't need this kind
of energy around him now.

35:31.280 --> 35:35.288
Now... Ellie's been in a
lot of trouble with the law.

35:35.323 --> 35:39.296
It wouldn't be difficult
to chase her out of town.

35:40.588 --> 35:43.139
Well, I'm sure he'd
appreciate the offer,

35:43.174 --> 35:45.690
but I don't think he'd
want you to do that.

35:46.515 --> 35:47.576
Excuse me.

35:47.611 --> 35:52.606
I got the DNA results for your
decapitated Civil War corset victim,

35:52.641 --> 35:55.133
and the blood from the
field is a match to Carson,

35:55.168 --> 35:56.602
but the epithelials on the toupee

35:56.638 --> 35:58.003
from the train tracks are not.

35:58.038 --> 36:01.983
So, were any of your
suspects wearing a rug?

36:02.633 --> 36:04.834
I can think of one.

36:06.752 --> 36:08.105
Please be careful.

36:08.141 --> 36:10.436
That's a very expensive piece.

36:10.503 --> 36:12.752
I don't understand why I'm here again.

36:12.787 --> 36:15.003
It's not a crime to lose your hair.

36:15.038 --> 36:16.569
Depends on where you lose it.

36:16.604 --> 36:18.066
If it's on the train tracks

36:18.101 --> 36:21.141
near a decapitated body with
the victim's blood on it,

36:21.176 --> 36:23.692
it's usually a crime.

36:24.646 --> 36:26.546
Mr. Kimble, would you like to

36:26.581 --> 36:28.445
revise your prior statement?

36:28.511 --> 36:30.008
Or would you prefer to wait in a cell

36:30.043 --> 36:32.107
while we match toupees?

36:34.294 --> 36:37.513
It was an accident.

36:37.548 --> 36:39.234
Which part?

36:39.270 --> 36:42.466
I suppose mostly the
part when I shot him.

36:44.106 --> 36:46.587
I could see the insanity in his eyes.

36:49.559 --> 36:50.985
Mr. Carson, you shot him!

36:51.020 --> 36:52.377
You really shot him!

36:52.412 --> 36:54.175
And I intend to kill him.

36:54.674 --> 36:56.210
Get out of my way!

36:56.277 --> 36:57.479
Please!

37:01.323 --> 37:04.098
He was really going to kill that man.

37:04.133 --> 37:07.051
If it was an accident,
you should have called 911.

37:07.086 --> 37:10.819
I couldn't let him be found like that.

37:11.528 --> 37:13.102
His corseting was private.

37:13.137 --> 37:14.640
You're right, it's much better

37:14.676 --> 37:17.859
to have his body found stripped
and dumped on some train tracks.

37:17.894 --> 37:20.902
His great-great-great
grandfather died trying to stop

37:20.937 --> 37:23.630
a Yankee train from entering Virginia.

37:23.665 --> 37:25.820
Legend has it he stood
square on the tracks

37:25.855 --> 37:29.137
firing at the engineer
until the train ran him down.

37:29.173 --> 37:32.425
Mr. Carson spoke of it frequently.

37:32.460 --> 37:35.678
He said it was an honorable death.

37:38.044 --> 37:41.056
I was just trying to give him the same.

37:42.297 --> 37:44.624
All right, look, are you
guys arresting me or what?

37:44.659 --> 37:46.131
Hey, don't get in my face.

37:46.166 --> 37:49.246
All he told me was bring you here.

37:51.474 --> 37:54.881
Hi. Come in.

38:00.698 --> 38:02.032
This is your dad's office.

38:02.067 --> 38:03.872
Yeah, I can read.

38:05.968 --> 38:07.731
Have a seat.

38:07.766 --> 38:10.218
Why?

38:10.284 --> 38:12.350
Why not?

38:46.290 --> 38:49.643
That's the reason we
asked you to come in.

38:49.709 --> 38:53.687
That's like loving a puppy. That's easy.

38:54.855 --> 38:58.042
You know, did you ever think that
maybe he's better off just lying there

38:58.077 --> 39:01.554
and not waking up?

39:01.589 --> 39:03.964
A lot easier.

39:04.723 --> 39:06.198
Every patient is different,

39:06.233 --> 39:09.189
but for now, no change is good news.

39:10.554 --> 39:12.023
Excuse me.

39:13.399 --> 39:15.489
Hi, Lindsey.

39:15.637 --> 39:19.408
I know, I told you that
I might be a little while.

39:19.443 --> 39:23.076
No, I said that we could
try and see a movie.

39:23.111 --> 39:24.618
Hey, you know what?

39:24.653 --> 39:26.786
I've got a friend here who
is fighting for his life.

39:26.821 --> 39:28.937
I would appreciate a
little understanding.

39:28.972 --> 39:31.337
I will talk about this
with you later. Good-bye.

39:32.249 --> 39:34.248
How old?

39:34.315 --> 39:35.546
Fourteen.

39:35.581 --> 39:36.743
Supposedly.

39:36.778 --> 39:39.704
I got one of those
in high school myself.

39:39.739 --> 39:42.253
World's pretty small at that age.

39:42.288 --> 39:45.145
It feels pretty small
to me right now, too.

41:10.506 --> 41:12.076
Hey.

41:12.143 --> 41:13.779
Hey.

41:13.814 --> 41:15.930
Have some water.

41:22.329 --> 41:25.262
Thanks for not pulling the plug.

41:25.297 --> 41:29.258
Your, uh, fan club is here.

41:54.037 --> 41:56.235
I don't know.

41:56.270 --> 41:59.280
Most people want to die
in their sleep, I suppose.

41:59.315 --> 42:02.228
Never know that it's happening.

42:02.597 --> 42:04.901
Like a crime scene.

42:04.936 --> 42:07.205
Surprise, you're dead.

42:07.273 --> 42:11.650
I'd prefer to know in advance
that I was going to die.

42:13.462 --> 42:15.706
I'd like to be diagnosed
with cancer, actually.

42:15.741 --> 42:18.666
Have some time to prepare.

42:21.205 --> 42:24.211
Go back to the rain
forest one more time.

42:24.246 --> 42:26.552
Reread Moby Dick.

42:27.090 --> 42:30.159
Possibly enter an
international chess tournament.

42:30.780 --> 42:35.606
At least have enough time to say
good-bye to the people I love.

42:39.893 --> 42:43.062
I'm not ready to say good-bye.

42:43.063 --> 42:54.063
