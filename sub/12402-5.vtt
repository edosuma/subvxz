-[both] Whoa!

00:16.351 --> 00:18.228
-What happened to you?
-[Maria grunts]

00:18.311 --> 00:19.812
I had to go on an action date with Chad.

00:19.938 --> 00:22.607
I had to roller skate up Runyon Canyon.

00:22.690 --> 00:23.983
Why would you even do that?

00:24.067 --> 00:30.782
Well, because he read my OKCupes profile,
and I wasn't 100% honest, really.

00:30.865 --> 00:32.575
What's it say? Let me see it.

00:32.659 --> 00:34.577
It was around the truth.

00:34.661 --> 00:36.079
Wow, you think? Look at this.

00:36.162 --> 00:38.206
-Interests: hiking.
-Yeah.

00:38.289 --> 00:39.582
-Speedboating.
-I wish.

00:39.666 --> 00:41.834
-Rock climbing, anything with rocks.
-I hope.

00:41.918 --> 00:43.586
-[Dagmar] Jam bands. Tumbling?
-Why not?

00:43.670 --> 00:44.963
-March Madness?
-What is it?

00:45.046 --> 00:48.049
I've never seen you give a shit
about any of this before.

00:48.132 --> 00:50.718
That was the old me
trying not to be the real me.

00:50.802 --> 00:52.971
-[Dagmar] Okay.
-That was BladeHardorDie12.

00:56.724 --> 00:58.977
The fact that there's
11 other people with that name

00:59.060 --> 01:00.144
makes me wanna kill myself.

01:00.228 --> 01:01.813
[cell phone ringing]

01:01.938 --> 01:04.649
Oh, God.
Chad just sent me a text for the...

01:05.567 --> 01:08.653
Tough Mudder race
in Santa Barbara next weekend.

01:08.736 --> 01:11.281
[groaning] Don't people die during those?

01:11.364 --> 01:12.574
Mmm-hmm. All the time.

01:12.657 --> 01:14.784
You know, I could get you a sign-up sheet.

01:14.867 --> 01:17.662
You're hurting yourself
as you're hurting me.

01:17.745 --> 01:19.038
-[Dagmar] That right?
-Guys.

01:19.122 --> 01:20.665
I've got to go tell Chad

01:20.748 --> 01:22.625
I am not this person.

01:22.709 --> 01:25.295
I've spent over $2,600
at Sports Authority.

01:25.378 --> 01:27.338
I am becoming a sports authority.

01:27.422 --> 01:28.673
No more action dates.

01:28.756 --> 01:30.466
I am not active!

01:30.550 --> 01:31.926
-Good.
-[Maria] All right.

01:32.010 --> 01:33.761
Go make some boundaries.

01:33.845 --> 01:35.930
Watch out, guys!

01:36.014 --> 01:40.852
I... I stop with my hands,
which means I'm on an adventure.

I'm so super pumped
about how super pumped you are

01:59.162 --> 02:01.539
-about crushing it fitness-wise.
-[panting]

02:01.623 --> 02:02.999
Oh, God, yeah. [coughs]

02:03.082 --> 02:06.085
The most important thing
in life is health.

02:06.169 --> 02:07.920
Yeah. That's why I signed us up

02:08.003 --> 02:10.590
for a doubles couple Ironman competition
in San Diego.

02:10.673 --> 02:13.009
I didn't wanna tell you until
we got kale shakes.

02:13.092 --> 02:14.844
But, like my ab tattoo says,

02:14.927 --> 02:16.638
you just gotta live in the moment.

02:16.721 --> 02:17.889
Yeah. Hey, um...

02:17.972 --> 02:19.098
Chad!

02:19.182 --> 02:21.643
I have something
really important to tell you.

02:21.726 --> 02:23.353
[panting] Chad? Oh, God!

02:23.436 --> 02:26.564
That's insane. I have something
important to tell you, too.

02:26.648 --> 02:28.858
-Oh, my... We're, like, in sync.
-Yeah.

02:28.941 --> 02:30.151
Wait. Before you go...

02:30.234 --> 02:33.696
Let me turn the GoPro on
'cause I wanna tell you something.

-Okay.
-Maria Bamford.

02:35.114 --> 02:36.783
Yeah?

02:36.866 --> 02:38.993
-Look right down the barrel.
-Okay?

02:39.077 --> 02:40.411
-I love you.
-[gasps]

02:41.412 --> 02:43.331
[grunting] Okay.

02:43.414 --> 02:45.208
-Now, you go.
-Okay, what do I say?

02:45.291 --> 02:46.959
[chuckling nervously]

02:47.043 --> 02:48.169
Say, "I love you, too."

02:50.046 --> 02:51.089
I love you, too--

02:51.172 --> 02:53.216
-Fuck yeah, you do!
-[both laughing]

02:56.427 --> 02:57.845
[Maria panting]

02:59.097 --> 03:01.182
So, how'd it go with Chad?

03:01.265 --> 03:03.184
Did you tell him that you're 90% slug?

03:03.267 --> 03:05.895
I couldn't. It all went terribly wrong.

03:05.978 --> 03:09.023
It was like a nightmare.
He told me he loved me.

03:09.107 --> 03:10.650
And then I tell him,

03:10.733 --> 03:12.235
"Oh, I love you, too."

03:12.318 --> 03:15.154
Isn't that how you're supposed to do it?
Don't ask me.

03:15.238 --> 03:16.739
I can't give this cat away.

03:16.823 --> 03:17.949
Listen, cunt. Could you go?

03:18.032 --> 03:20.785
[Larissa] Come on.
I wanna hear the rest of the story.

03:20.868 --> 03:24.080
My therapist says you're a trigger.
I don't wanna live like this.

03:25.456 --> 03:27.041
I respect your journey.

03:28.459 --> 03:30.545
That's it. I'm gonna break up with him.

03:30.628 --> 03:31.838
Why?

03:31.921 --> 03:34.215
Why? You ask, "Why"?

03:34.298 --> 03:35.299
-Yeah.
-Well, for one,

03:35.383 --> 03:38.261
he went on a total rampage
at the batting cages.

03:38.344 --> 03:39.804
Yeah, yeah.

03:39.929 --> 03:41.431
I forgot to tell you.

03:41.514 --> 03:44.475
[ballpark organ playing]

03:45.560 --> 03:50.022

03:50.648 --> 03:51.816
[clapping]

03:52.525 --> 03:57.697
Wait, so he screamed at you,
"Bitch, cunt, whore, slut."

03:57.780 --> 04:00.575
Well, I don't know
if it was exactly those words,

04:00.658 --> 04:03.453
but it was the essence of the gist of it.

04:03.536 --> 04:05.496
It's like I saw him for the first time.

04:05.580 --> 04:08.624
It's like a veil lifted,
and a monster was there.

04:08.708 --> 04:12.628
Maria, this does not sound like the Chad
that you were action-dating,

04:12.712 --> 04:14.547
or was it datercising?

04:14.630 --> 04:18.176
I'm telling you,
it was like a veil lifted...

04:19.260 --> 04:20.428
and a monster was there.

04:22.221 --> 04:23.264
Good job.

04:23.347 --> 04:26.142
Fuck! I am gonna kill
this fucking, asshole puppy!

04:26.225 --> 04:27.977
[Maria] Oh, God! No!
[dog whining]

04:28.060 --> 04:30.563
Wait, where did the puppy come from?

04:30.646 --> 04:32.064
-I didn't tell you?
-No!

04:32.148 --> 04:33.941
The puppy was there the whole time.

04:34.025 --> 04:35.818
But I thought he wanted to hit you?

04:35.902 --> 04:38.112
He wanted to hit me.
He wanted to hit everyone.

04:38.196 --> 04:40.656
His rage was indiscriminate.

04:40.740 --> 04:44.660
It was like a veil was lifted
and a monster was there.

04:44.744 --> 04:47.955

that the cure for cancer is

04:48.039 --> 04:49.457

Strike three, fuckos.

-[gunshot]

04:54.670 --> 04:57.548
Wait, I get it.
You're fucking with me, right?

04:57.632 --> 05:02.595
No! No, it's like a veil was lifted...
and a monster was there.

05:02.678 --> 05:06.182
Okay, little mama, listen.
I think I know what's happening.

05:06.265 --> 05:09.185
Chad told you that he loved you
and you freaked out.

05:09.268 --> 05:12.146
'Cause you don't think you're
worthy of love, but that's not true.

05:12.230 --> 05:15.399
-We all love you. I love you.
-I love you.

05:16.984 --> 05:18.528
We just want you to be happy.

05:19.570 --> 05:21.239
Why can't you let him love you?

05:21.322 --> 05:23.115
I have my reasons.

05:23.991 --> 05:26.619
There is just no way to understand them.

Baked brie, check.
Toll House cookies, check.

That is how you take an open house
into a sold house.

05:44.470 --> 05:45.930
[Maria whispering] Oh, my gosh!

05:46.013 --> 05:47.223
-No!
-[whimpering]

05:47.306 --> 05:49.976
Those aren't pleasure cookies.
They're business cookies.

05:50.059 --> 05:51.602
Okay.

05:51.686 --> 05:53.187
-No!
-[moaning] Oh.

-Those are not--
-Come on--

-No!

Oh, God.

Oh, oh!

05:59.735 --> 06:01.112
What's wrong with you?

06:02.822 --> 06:04.448
What is this shit?

06:04.532 --> 06:06.284
That's my vision drawer.

06:06.367 --> 06:09.287
It's a message to the universe
of what I want in a perfect man,

06:09.370 --> 06:11.581
so the universe will bring said man to me.

06:11.664 --> 06:13.040
-That's sad. Clear it out.
-Okay.

06:13.124 --> 06:15.001
Put it in your bedroom where no one else

06:15.084 --> 06:16.335
-has ever been.
-Okay.

06:16.419 --> 06:18.337
[Karen] Are those dogs?
They need to go.

06:18.421 --> 06:20.131
Do you have a cardboard box
and packing tape?

06:20.214 --> 06:21.424
You can't do that.

06:21.507 --> 06:24.010
You can. I once put a Rottweiler
in a plastic wreath container.

06:24.093 --> 06:25.428
He sleeps in there. He loves it.

06:26.304 --> 06:27.597
Do you think we can sell this house?

06:27.680 --> 06:30.516
I know I just bought it,
but I just wanna get rid of it.

06:30.600 --> 06:32.101
I don't know why you're selling.

06:32.184 --> 06:35.313
You have so much money coming out
of that ass crack from Checklist ads.

06:35.396 --> 06:37.273
Every time I open the computer,
one pops up.

06:37.356 --> 06:39.400
It interrupted my porn.
I had to work you in.

06:39.483 --> 06:41.110
I don't know how much longer
I'll be doing it.

06:41.193 --> 06:42.778
I think Checklist is evil.

06:42.862 --> 06:46.032
And Susan is right.
This house isn't right for me.

06:46.115 --> 06:48.159
I need to unload it as fast as possible.

06:48.242 --> 06:49.910
-Hey!
-Jesus Christ!

06:49.994 --> 06:51.537
You listen up good right now!

06:51.621 --> 06:53.372
[Karen] I'm gonna say this one time.

06:53.456 --> 06:56.459
-Okay...
-You are not unloading this house.

06:56.542 --> 06:59.003
-Okay.
-Okay? Bullet points.

06:59.086 --> 07:02.340
[whispering] You're about to move in
with your boyfriend, okay?

07:02.423 --> 07:03.507
He runs a hedge fund.

07:04.300 --> 07:06.010
-You're huge in London.
-Okay, yeah.

07:06.093 --> 07:08.596
-You're selling out the Buckingham Palace.
-Okay.

07:08.679 --> 07:10.264
-You're in demand there.
-Okay.

07:10.348 --> 07:13.267
-This house is in demand, okay?
-[whimpering] Okay.

07:13.351 --> 07:15.186
-Okay?
-[crying] Okay.

07:17.605 --> 07:20.608
-[whimpering]
-Don't fuck with me, Maria.

07:20.691 --> 07:22.443
Don't fuck me.

07:22.526 --> 07:24.070
[doorbell rings]

07:24.153 --> 07:25.529
Hi! Come on in!

07:25.613 --> 07:27.031
-What the...
-[Maria] Hi!

07:27.114 --> 07:29.367
So, yes. My husband is very rich

07:29.450 --> 07:31.452
with money
from his hedge trimming business,

07:31.535 --> 07:35.581
so, we're moving to Buckingham Palace.

07:35.665 --> 07:38.000
Money's not an object for me or an issue,

07:38.084 --> 07:42.421
you know, it's like, just so much of it
except for folding it, you know.

07:42.505 --> 07:44.423
How much I have in my pockets.

07:44.507 --> 07:45.883
It's a very sturdy kitchen.

07:45.967 --> 07:49.178
Rebar... [grunting]
...coming up through--

07:49.261 --> 07:50.846
-And there's a roof.
-[growls]

07:50.930 --> 07:52.765
-[laughing]
-[snarls]

07:52.848 --> 07:55.101
I'm scared of my realtor.

07:56.352 --> 07:58.813
-[indistinct speaking]
-Blossy? Where... Oh.

07:58.896 --> 08:00.314
-Oh, hi. [chuckling]
-Hi.

08:00.398 --> 08:03.484
These two guys must have been
playing around in here.

08:03.567 --> 08:06.862
Got themselves stuck inside
this perfectly sealed box.

08:06.946 --> 08:09.031
Oh... Karen Grisham.

08:09.115 --> 08:11.033
So, you're looking at this house, too?

08:11.117 --> 08:15.788
Well... kinda. For the last time.
For I am the seller!

08:16.831 --> 08:19.375
[chuckling] I'm moving in with my fiancé.

08:19.458 --> 08:21.502
-Oh, cool.
-Yeah.

08:21.585 --> 08:22.795
-Yeah!
-[chuckling]

08:22.878 --> 08:24.588
-What a fun way to tell me that.
-Yeah.

08:24.672 --> 08:25.923
I don't know what I'm doing.

08:26.007 --> 08:29.260
So... does any of this furniture
come with the place?

08:29.343 --> 08:31.303
-No!
-Ah!

08:31.387 --> 08:34.181
-I have the exact same cologne.
-Really?

08:34.265 --> 08:38.144
Oh... [chuckling]
And I'm wearing the exact same shirt.

08:38.227 --> 08:40.604
-You are. You really are.
-[chuckling]

08:40.730 --> 08:41.981
Holy shit.

08:42.063 --> 08:43.607
Jack London?

08:43.691 --> 08:46.819
-That's my favorite author--
-Stop talking! [chuckling]

08:46.902 --> 08:49.405
Your fiancé and I
could be the same person.

08:49.488 --> 08:51.240
Well, you could be. You are...

08:51.323 --> 08:53.492
I mean, if you wanted to be. You could be.

08:53.576 --> 08:54.618
What?

08:54.702 --> 08:57.413
[stuttering] The thing is that we--

08:57.496 --> 09:00.207
We're on the skids.
I mean, I'm basically...

09:00.291 --> 09:02.918
You know, just, single and...

09:03.002 --> 09:05.087
I'm selling the house right away,

09:05.171 --> 09:08.924
but I don't need to 'cause I am loaded
and it's paid off in full,

09:09.008 --> 09:10.968
but the thing is that London...

09:11.052 --> 09:14.680
Uh, it's complicated.

09:14.764 --> 09:17.516
My life is pretty complicated, too,
right now.

09:17.600 --> 09:19.560
I'm actually going through a divorce.

09:19.643 --> 09:21.562
[gasping] Oh, my God!

09:21.687 --> 09:23.105
I don't know how it'll work out.

09:23.189 --> 09:26.108
[laughing awkwardly] No!
Of course, we don't know...

09:26.192 --> 09:29.236
ever, how it's gonna work out, do we?
[chuckles]

09:30.404 --> 09:31.906
Oh...

09:31.989 --> 09:33.115
I'm late for something.

09:33.199 --> 09:34.366
-I gotta go.
-Oh.

09:34.450 --> 09:36.118
I was hoping
to check out more of the house.

09:36.202 --> 09:38.871
Okay, you can.
The thing is, come by later,

09:38.954 --> 09:41.665
and I'll microwave you some taqooktito...
[sighs]

09:41.749 --> 09:43.584
I will microwave you some taquitos!

09:43.667 --> 09:45.252
Get it right, Maria! [laughing]

09:45.336 --> 09:49.173
And then, I'll show you more of the house
and the pugs and...

09:50.299 --> 09:52.760
Everything.
I'll show you everything.

09:52.843 --> 09:54.261
I'd like that.

09:54.345 --> 09:55.930
[whimpers]

09:59.475 --> 10:01.769
-[beeping]
-Dum, dum, bam, pum,

10:01.852 --> 10:02.853
bum. [chuckles]

10:03.854 --> 10:07.358
Well, you know,
this is a Spanish Colonial,

10:07.441 --> 10:09.443
and, uh... [chuckles]

10:09.527 --> 10:11.779
That means the pipes are copper

10:11.862 --> 10:15.282
and the wires are copper

10:15.366 --> 10:16.909
and everything is copper,

10:16.992 --> 10:18.119
even the bath.

10:18.202 --> 10:19.703
Yeah, it's, uh...

10:19.787 --> 10:22.873
It feels so good
against my naked skin, you know.

10:22.957 --> 10:25.960
It's just so... ooh.

10:26.043 --> 10:28.796
Did I tell you about the low-flow toilet?

10:28.879 --> 10:34.677
Ooh, that feels so, so good
against my naked skin.

10:34.760 --> 10:39.181
Oh, the whole house feels
really good against my naked skin.

10:39.265 --> 10:40.349
Ooh, yeah.

10:40.432 --> 10:42.309
[moaning]

10:42.393 --> 10:45.396
-Even the stucco?
-Oh, yeah.

10:45.479 --> 10:49.483
It's a real exfoliant. Ooh, nice.

10:49.567 --> 10:51.652
[laughing seductively]

10:52.528 --> 10:55.823
You know, it's just got everything
you'd ever need.

10:55.906 --> 10:58.909
There's a garbage disposal.
Ooh!

10:58.993 --> 11:03.122
And, uh, you can come in
from the back, or the front.

11:03.205 --> 11:05.124
-[laughing]
-That's fun, you know.

11:05.207 --> 11:07.710
It comes out--
Oh!

11:07.793 --> 11:09.879
-Whoo! Whoo!
-[both laughing]

11:10.963 --> 11:13.841
You know what?
I love it.

11:13.924 --> 11:16.218
I want it.
Let's seal the deal.

11:16.302 --> 11:18.929
But you haven't even seen
my unfinished basement.

11:19.930 --> 11:20.973
-[both chuckle]
-Okay.

11:21.056 --> 11:22.683
Okay, uh...

11:22.766 --> 11:25.144
-Okay. Oh.
-Um...

11:25.227 --> 11:26.729
[muffled moaning]

11:28.272 --> 11:29.648
[Maria] <i>I couldn't believe it.</i>

11:29.732 --> 11:31.650
<i>The perfect man jumped</i>
<i>out of my vision drawer</i>

11:31.734 --> 11:33.527
<i>and into my 30-year mortgage.</i>

11:33.611 --> 11:36.196
<i>I had it all.</i>
<i>Love and financial security.</i>

11:36.280 --> 11:37.990
-[chuckling] Okay.
-What'd she say?

11:38.073 --> 11:42.328
Karen Grisham said to go fuck yourself,
and that the deal will not go through.

11:42.411 --> 11:43.913
Why not?

11:43.996 --> 11:46.248
You have such a low credit score.

11:46.332 --> 11:47.458
What's a credit score?

11:47.541 --> 11:48.918
Are you serious?

11:49.001 --> 11:51.420
Graham, you don't know your credit score?

11:51.503 --> 11:52.838
I don't even know what one is.

11:52.922 --> 11:54.882
-Oh.
-I'm not a banker, I'm a stuntman.

11:54.965 --> 11:57.676
I can't believe this. You have a Jaguar.

11:57.760 --> 11:58.677
Thank you.

12:00.471 --> 12:01.889
Actually, I have two.

12:04.767 --> 12:06.644
Three, if you count the third one.

12:09.313 --> 12:11.607
-You have three Jaguars?
-Thank you.

12:11.690 --> 12:13.067
Karen Grisham said,

12:13.150 --> 12:15.903
"With a credit score that low,
you can't even rent."

12:15.986 --> 12:18.113
This just became a really bad day.

12:18.197 --> 12:20.324
-Yeah.
-This morning I was crushing it.

12:20.407 --> 12:21.825
Now, I don't know where I'm gonna live.

12:21.909 --> 12:24.787
-[sighs]
-We're screwed, buddy. Hmm?

12:24.870 --> 12:28.082
You know, I guess you could...
you could stay with me.

12:28.165 --> 12:31.835
You know, just till you get
things together, you know, just...

12:31.919 --> 12:35.381
But wouldn't that be weird?
Since we just started dating?

12:35.464 --> 12:39.760
You know, I can be your lady.
And your landlady.

12:39.843 --> 12:41.261
[both chuckle]

12:41.345 --> 12:44.056
Yeah, it would be weird,
but that's how I know

12:44.139 --> 12:46.725
[stuttering] it's the right thing.

12:46.809 --> 12:48.811
God, you are so strong.

12:48.894 --> 12:50.312
I know.

12:50.396 --> 12:51.438
[chuckles]

12:53.273 --> 12:54.650
[muffled screaming]

12:57.569 --> 13:00.572
[Maria] <i>Okay, so I had no boundaries</i>
<i>with Graham in the past.</i>

13:00.656 --> 13:02.282
<i>I wasn't gonna let that happen with Chad.</i>

13:02.366 --> 13:04.702
<i>I had to break up with him.</i>

13:07.621 --> 13:10.207
Okay, hi.
Are we ready to order?

13:11.750 --> 13:15.004
Here's what I want you
to do for me, Brian.

13:15.087 --> 13:18.007
I want you to run my card now.

13:18.090 --> 13:21.593
I'm gonna be making a hard out
after appetizers,

13:21.677 --> 13:23.637
'cause I'm breaking up with my boyfriend.

13:23.721 --> 13:26.849
I mean, he's not my boyfriend per se...

13:26.932 --> 13:28.600
I mean, we haven't even kissed,

13:28.684 --> 13:30.227
but we have said, "I love you."

13:30.310 --> 13:32.271
[chuckling] Right. Oh, very good.

13:32.354 --> 13:33.480
Wanna hear my plan?

13:33.564 --> 13:35.274
Okay, he's gonna sit down,

13:35.357 --> 13:37.735
and I'm gonna look at him and say,

13:37.818 --> 13:41.822
"Hey, Chad."
That's his name, Brian... Chad.

13:43.741 --> 13:45.534
I'm just gonna look at him and say,

13:45.617 --> 13:48.370
"Chad, I just can't see you anymore."

13:49.455 --> 13:52.458
God, I'm so on!
I wish he was here right now.

13:52.541 --> 13:54.877
[sighs] Help me out, Brian.

13:54.960 --> 13:57.337
I would love to have a fun cocktail,

13:57.421 --> 14:00.299
but I am up to my ear-balls
in psych meds.

14:00.382 --> 14:01.759
[both chuckle]

14:01.842 --> 14:05.721
Do you have
a non-alcoholic option?

14:06.513 --> 14:07.473
Sans alcohol?

14:07.556 --> 14:09.516
Let's see what our mixologist, Garlopfft,

14:09.600 --> 14:11.185
can whip up for you.

14:11.268 --> 14:12.519
[gasps] Oh!

14:13.270 --> 14:15.355
[Brian] Here we have
the Devil's Sugarbowl.

14:15.439 --> 14:17.232
Compliments of Garlopfft.

14:20.611 --> 14:22.446
I give you... Grandma's Candy Store.

14:22.529 --> 14:25.449
[gasps] What a fun idea.

14:25.532 --> 14:26.950
[screaming] Garlopfft!

14:27.034 --> 14:28.118
[Maria chuckling]

14:28.202 --> 14:29.411
[Brian] Here we are.

14:29.495 --> 14:32.581
Last drink of the night.
Something we call "Glass of Sugar."

14:32.664 --> 14:34.041
Oh, what's in it?

14:34.124 --> 14:35.334
Sugar in a glass.

14:35.417 --> 14:37.878
-Oh.
-Garlopfft left for the night. It's late.

14:37.961 --> 14:41.673
[hyperventilating] I can't believe
I've been stood up, Brian.

14:41.757 --> 14:44.343
You know, you were
gonna break up with him,

14:44.426 --> 14:45.928
so it's probably for the best.

14:46.011 --> 14:49.223
What kind of guy
doesn't show up at Manjjiaznoz?

14:49.890 --> 14:51.725
I'll tell you the kind of guy.

14:51.809 --> 14:55.270
It's the kind of guy
who sniper-blasts a puppy scientist

14:55.354 --> 14:57.856
who's on the verge of curing cancer.

14:58.690 --> 14:59.817
You know, I wasn't there,

14:59.900 --> 15:01.860
but that story sounds pretty made up.

15:01.944 --> 15:03.153
You know what, you weren't.

15:03.237 --> 15:06.323
You weren't there!

15:07.324 --> 15:09.076
[screaming] So zip it, ya dick!

15:09.159 --> 15:11.537
-I'm just trying to help you out.
-Easy, clown.

15:11.620 --> 15:14.289
Don't go off on me, too.
I'm outta here!

15:15.416 --> 15:16.500
Clown!

15:17.084 --> 15:18.961
[Maria] How dare you stand me up?

15:19.044 --> 15:21.755
Chad is dead meat!

15:23.298 --> 15:25.884
[sobbing] I know, honey.
It's unbelievable.

15:25.968 --> 15:27.970
[man stutters] You must be Maria.

15:28.053 --> 15:29.805
-We're Chad's parents.
-[whimpering]

15:29.888 --> 15:31.348
We saw his GoPro.

15:31.473 --> 15:33.642
We know how much you meant to each other.

15:33.725 --> 15:35.269
The love part.

15:35.352 --> 15:37.271
Oh. You saw that?

15:37.354 --> 15:40.023
Chad's GoPro survived the kiln explosion.

15:40.107 --> 15:41.358
[sobbing]

15:41.442 --> 15:44.278
Wha-- He's a potter?

15:44.361 --> 15:46.572
So what's going on? Where's Chad?

15:46.655 --> 15:48.615
He's dead, honey.

15:48.699 --> 15:51.452
He hit the end zone and kept on running.

15:51.535 --> 15:54.121
Like Bo Jackson
on <i>Monday Night Football</i>, right?

15:54.204 --> 15:56.832
-[sobbing]
-Right. What a game. [sniffling]

15:56.915 --> 15:59.793
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

15:59.877 --> 16:03.630
[Maria] I'm so sorry.
[repeats indistinctly]

16:07.426 --> 16:09.470
[Maria] <i>Death.</i>
<i>The ultimate boundary.</i>

16:09.553 --> 16:13.515
<i>My best friend's husband, Paul,</i>
<i>was obsessed with death.</i>

16:13.599 --> 16:15.809
<i>So, naturally, I was drawn to him.</i>

16:17.769 --> 16:20.522
-It's a banana in a car.
-[laughing]

16:21.857 --> 16:23.901
Paul, these drawings are awesome.

16:23.984 --> 16:25.694
Nah, they're just dumb doodles.

16:25.777 --> 16:27.404
These aren't dumb.

16:27.488 --> 16:29.615
This is incredible. What is this?

16:29.698 --> 16:32.409
Oh. That's a drawing of me
trying to hang myself,

16:32.493 --> 16:35.037
but I made the rope too long,
so I'm just standing.

16:35.120 --> 16:37.581
I fucked it up like I fuck up everything.

16:39.333 --> 16:40.501
Paul, you sound depressed.

16:40.584 --> 16:44.838
And I should know because I am
really depressed, clinically depressed.

16:44.922 --> 16:47.341
But art is helping me.

16:47.424 --> 16:49.009
If you did more art,

16:49.092 --> 16:53.597
you could feel better
about yourself and your life, in general.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.807
Susan doesn't like it when I'm creative.

16:55.891 --> 16:57.267
[stutters] What?

16:57.351 --> 16:59.645
She probably supports you now, right?

16:59.770 --> 17:02.314
Not at all.
She thinks we're working on your will.

17:02.397 --> 17:03.899
-Oh.
-[Susan] Ding-dong.

17:03.982 --> 17:05.817
Hide the stuff.

17:07.027 --> 17:08.444
-Hey.
-Hey.

17:08.529 --> 17:10.030
Hey. [chuckling]

17:13.407 --> 17:14.617
Why do I smell marker?

17:14.701 --> 17:16.203
[laughing]

17:16.286 --> 17:21.165
Oh. We were just working on some Post-its
for Maria's end-of-life five wishes.

17:21.250 --> 17:24.252
Yeah, like a colorful,
living revocable trust.

17:24.336 --> 17:26.838
Aw. Isn't he the best?

17:26.922 --> 17:29.299
-Yeah.
-Maybe one day you'll get one of these.

17:29.383 --> 17:30.676
Oh.

17:30.759 --> 17:32.135
-[grunting]
-Yeah.

17:32.219 --> 17:34.304
-[blows raspberry]
-[all chuckling]

17:34.388 --> 17:37.266
-But he's a human being.
-[both laughing]

17:37.349 --> 17:39.810
All right, we gotta get you
in the Lexus, okay?

17:39.893 --> 17:41.436
'Cause you need some golf pants.

17:41.520 --> 17:44.398
[gasping] Somebody's gonna throw
a little ball around.

17:45.607 --> 17:47.276
We can't meet like this anymore.

17:47.359 --> 17:49.611
Paul, you need art.

17:49.695 --> 17:53.031
[Susan] Paul, get your white ass
in the Lexus!

17:53.115 --> 17:54.324
[sighing]

17:56.118 --> 17:57.619
Skype me later, okay?

17:57.703 --> 18:00.998
It's Susan's bath night,
so we should have an hour and 45 to talk.

18:01.081 --> 18:05.294
Maybe two hours if she has wine.
She's gonna have wine, so...

18:05.377 --> 18:08.714
[breathes heavily] Cool, cool.

18:14.177 --> 18:15.387
[Marilyn] Hi, we're home.

18:16.096 --> 18:19.141
-[Maria] Hi.
-Hello, kiddo, listen.

18:19.224 --> 18:22.936
I don't know what's going on,
but you're playing with fire.

18:23.020 --> 18:26.189
Susan called earlier,
and she's pretty PO'ed.

18:26.273 --> 18:28.483
She said Paul's drawing his head off,

18:28.567 --> 18:31.778
he's slacking with his work,
and Susan's sick about it.

18:31.862 --> 18:36.033
Well, we're just making art.
He's a really good painter and drawer.

18:36.116 --> 18:39.828
We just won the logo contest
for the psych center.

18:39.911 --> 18:42.414
No offense, honey,
but if that won first prize,

18:42.497 --> 18:44.166
there are lots of zeros in that group.

18:44.249 --> 18:46.835
Anyway, talk to Paul. No more art.

18:46.918 --> 18:48.837
Susan can talk to him.

18:48.920 --> 18:51.256
He's her husband. I'm not married to him.

18:51.340 --> 18:54.176
Oh, sweetie, we're all well aware
you're not married.

18:54.259 --> 18:58.138
Anyway, your father and I went
to the greatest show tonight,

18:58.221 --> 18:59.431
the Cirque du Soleil.

18:59.514 --> 19:01.683
[Joel] A display of art and showmanship.

19:01.767 --> 19:03.352
It was French, but made you feel American.

19:03.435 --> 19:07.105
Yes, it was called <i>Q'Ontained,</i>
with a Q.

19:07.189 --> 19:11.318
And you know how crazy I am about things
that fit inside other things.

19:14.071 --> 19:15.238
[Marilyn] <i>I said to Joel,</i>

19:15.322 --> 19:18.241
<i>"Oh, dear Christ, Joel,</i>
<i>he's gonna do it."</i>

19:18.325 --> 19:19.534
She did. And you know what?

19:20.160 --> 19:21.620
-He did it!
-He did it.

19:21.703 --> 19:23.664
[audience cheering]

19:23.747 --> 19:24.998
[Joel] <i>I couldn't believe it.</i>

19:25.082 --> 19:28.043
[Marilyn] <i>And I said,</i>
<i>"Joel, oh, sweet Jesus in a basket.</i>

19:28.126 --> 19:30.796
He's in, Joel! He's in!"

19:30.879 --> 19:33.507
And you know what? He was in!

19:35.592 --> 19:36.718
[audience cheering]

19:36.802 --> 19:39.888
[Marilyn] <i>I'm telling you, it was sorcery.</i>

19:39.971 --> 19:41.056
The dark arts!

19:42.432 --> 19:45.394
I can't even picture
what was actually happening.

19:45.477 --> 19:48.522
And now, your father has some new ideas.

19:48.605 --> 19:50.565
-Sex ideas.
-[Joel] Mmm-hmm.

19:50.649 --> 19:51.900
-Oh.
-With sex.

19:51.983 --> 19:54.444
-Maria,
-[Maria] Oh, boy.

19:54.528 --> 19:55.904
It is possible to have

19:55.987 --> 19:58.615
-a highly satisfying sex life...
-Oh, God.

19:58.699 --> 20:00.283
...well into your 70s.

20:00.367 --> 20:02.202
-That was the point of the show.
-Oh, God.

20:02.285 --> 20:06.498
But seriously now, don't have
Susan's husband draw anymore.

20:06.581 --> 20:10.043
Okay? It's better to just
keep things bottled up.

20:10.127 --> 20:11.670
You know, the Midwest way.

20:11.753 --> 20:12.963
<i>Q'Ontained.</i>

20:13.046 --> 20:14.172
-[smacks]
-Giddy up.

20:14.256 --> 20:15.674
Q'ontain yourself, <i>Monsieur</i> Joel.

20:15.757 --> 20:17.676
-[smacks]
-I can't.

20:17.759 --> 20:19.511
[Joel] Let's go inside other things.

20:19.594 --> 20:21.263
-[Marilyn] Okay.
-[Joel chuckles]

20:21.346 --> 20:22.597
[Joel smacks]

20:22.681 --> 20:24.307
I should've gone to bed.

20:25.934 --> 20:27.102
Hmm...

20:29.813 --> 20:31.356
[screaming]

20:31.440 --> 20:34.943
Yeah. No one can hear me comin'
in my new Moon Boots.

20:35.026 --> 20:37.738
And no one can hear you scream.

20:37.821 --> 20:40.741
Gotcha, poop drawers.
You've been served.

20:40.824 --> 20:42.075
[boots squeaking]

20:43.952 --> 20:47.456
Paul's billing me for the time
we spent drawing together?

20:47.539 --> 20:49.291
Nope, I sent you that.

20:49.374 --> 20:53.462
That's for all the billable hours
that you cost Paul and my family.

20:53.628 --> 20:55.255
You think I didn't know you guys have been

20:55.338 --> 20:57.382
sneaking off and Skypin' about

20:57.466 --> 20:59.551
your dumb art stuff
for the past two weeks?

20:59.634 --> 21:04.598
Paul needs this outlet.
I think he's really depressed.

21:04.681 --> 21:06.850
Yeah, everybody's depressed, Maria.

21:06.933 --> 21:08.685
It's called being an adult.

21:09.519 --> 21:11.480
That's the saddest thing
I've ever heard.

21:11.563 --> 21:13.273
No more art, Maria.

21:13.356 --> 21:14.608
[boots squeaking]

21:14.691 --> 21:16.902
Stop giving my husband hope.

21:18.403 --> 21:19.946
[boots squeaking]

21:22.032 --> 21:23.492
You can't hear me...

21:25.827 --> 21:26.870
but I'm always there.

21:35.796 --> 21:37.547
[chuckles]

21:39.132 --> 21:41.635
[Maria] <i>Sometimes life works out</i>
<i>the way it should.</i>

21:41.718 --> 21:43.637
<i>But not for Chad, because he's dead.</i>

21:46.014 --> 21:49.768
[man] Many of you here know Chad
from his many charities.

21:49.851 --> 21:51.394
Saving the Dolphins.

21:51.520 --> 21:52.854
Pots for the Poor.

21:54.189 --> 21:56.441
<i>Abogados Sin Fronteras.</i>

21:57.234 --> 21:58.819
Scuba for Burn Victims.

22:00.028 --> 22:01.363
India.

22:02.072 --> 22:03.990
Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS.

22:05.116 --> 22:08.203
And of course, his great passion,
International Pug Rescue.

22:08.286 --> 22:09.412
[gasps]

22:09.496 --> 22:10.622
[whispering] Pugs?

22:10.705 --> 22:11.873
He was an active athlete...

22:11.957 --> 22:15.252
-I knew that, I knew that.
-...who loved sport.

22:15.335 --> 22:17.671
While we mourn for Chad,

22:17.754 --> 22:21.633
let us also be comforted by the fact
that Chad died as he lived...

22:23.426 --> 22:25.720
throwing pots on a wheel for orphans.

22:27.097 --> 22:29.683
And racking up 20,000 steps on his Fitbit.

22:29.766 --> 22:31.142
[crying]

22:31.226 --> 22:35.105
Now, I'd like to bring up somebody
who is very important to Chad...

22:35.230 --> 22:36.481
Maria Bamford.

22:36.565 --> 22:37.899
[whispering] Okay, okay.

22:40.443 --> 22:42.112
It's no problem.

22:42.195 --> 22:43.280
Don't get up.

22:44.197 --> 22:46.741
Chad would've wanted me
to be as active as possible.

22:48.159 --> 22:49.452
Do lunges.

22:49.536 --> 22:51.288
[panting]

22:54.249 --> 22:55.458
[sighing]

22:57.043 --> 22:58.336
Hello, everyone.

23:01.381 --> 23:06.761
I knew Chad for about a month
and we spent a lot of time together.

23:06.845 --> 23:08.763
Did a lot of activities.

23:08.847 --> 23:10.015
[chuckles lightly]

23:11.683 --> 23:15.395
I used to have a lot of issues
with boundaries... [chuckles]

23:15.478 --> 23:17.188
and, uh...

23:17.272 --> 23:19.232
now I realize my main issue,

23:19.316 --> 23:23.528
the real issue, is that
I put up too many boundaries and that...

23:24.988 --> 23:26.948
I was keeping love out.

23:28.408 --> 23:32.662
Hearing of all of Chad's just amazing

23:33.997 --> 23:35.624
accomplishments, I think...

23:35.707 --> 23:40.295
he could have been someone I could've
had babies with, were that safe.

23:40.378 --> 23:43.840
But I am 45 and that is irresponsible!

23:43.923 --> 23:48.219
At this point, it's just selfish
and I should adopt.

23:48.303 --> 23:50.597
It's like this veil...

23:51.514 --> 23:53.516
has been lifted...

23:53.600 --> 23:56.144
and where the monster was...

23:57.145 --> 24:01.066
I am...
I am a monster.

24:01.149 --> 24:02.942
Oh, dear Chad.

24:03.818 --> 24:06.321
You loved me
and I couldn't love you back.

24:06.404 --> 24:11.493
I wasn't ready, and I am so sorry,
and I feel so ashamed.

24:11.576 --> 24:14.079
[groaning] Oh, Chad!

24:14.162 --> 24:15.497
[sobbing]

24:19.250 --> 24:20.126
Amen.

24:20.877 --> 24:22.462
-Sweetie.
-Thank you.

24:22.545 --> 24:23.755
[crying]

24:25.632 --> 24:28.134
And now a couple of words
from Chad's wife.

24:29.302 --> 24:31.471
[sobbing] What?

24:31.554 --> 24:33.098
Oh. Oh.

24:34.849 --> 24:37.018
Oh. Oh.

24:38.478 --> 24:39.854
[man] Hey, Maria.

24:39.938 --> 24:42.691
Rick Rondo, CAA.
I worked with Chad at CAA.

24:43.566 --> 24:45.694
-Oh.
-You know, before he died,

24:45.777 --> 24:47.737
he was so pumped about signing you.

24:47.821 --> 24:50.949
He said he was one action date away
from nailing it down.

24:51.032 --> 24:53.576
[stutters] He wanted to sign me?

24:53.660 --> 24:54.869
He was an agent?

24:54.953 --> 24:56.788
Yeah. At CAA.

24:56.871 --> 24:59.040
Our team pulled your OKCupes profile.

24:59.124 --> 25:00.792
What did you think those action dates
were about?

25:00.875 --> 25:03.294
-What?
-I mean, you had him hiking,

25:03.378 --> 25:05.338
spelunking, sailing.

25:05.422 --> 25:09.676
If that kiln explosion
hadn't literally ripped him in half,

25:09.759 --> 25:11.094
signing you would have.

25:11.177 --> 25:12.554
-[chuckling awkwardly]
-Yeah.

25:12.637 --> 25:15.390
Anyway, I'm picking up his sloppy seconds,

25:15.473 --> 25:17.434
and I want you
to know something important.

25:17.517 --> 25:18.852
Maria...

25:20.854 --> 25:22.188
I love you.

25:23.690 --> 25:24.816
Oh... [gasps]

25:27.193 --> 25:28.778
I love you, too.
