a proper wedding.

the courthouse on a Tuesday.

We have got to stay on these kids
all day, or else they're gonna burn.

We're still in touch with Elunga,

But it's one of the things he loves most
about me, and I can't tell him the truth now.

It would be like Lewis telling

Side note: We're very good friends
with a couple named Lewis and Clark.
