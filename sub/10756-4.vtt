WEBVTT

00:09.727 --> 00:12.560
Is it me or is the foam
a tad dense today?

00:12.727 --> 00:15.446
Like a dreary fog on a Scottish moor.

00:15.607 --> 00:18.167
Rather than accent, it overwhelms.

00:18.367 --> 00:20.483
Rather than flirt, it assaults.

00:20.687 --> 00:24.077
Rather than watching the ball game,
I have to listen to this.

00:25.607 --> 00:26.960
ROZ: Hey, you guys.
- Hey, Roz.

00:27.127 --> 00:28.276
- Like to join us?
- Oh, yes.

00:28.447 --> 00:32.042
Frasier, listen, don't forget your staff
meeting tomorrow. It starts at...

00:34.087 --> 00:37.921
Well, I certainly hope his tailor can fix
the holes you just burnt in his jacket.

00:38.367 --> 00:40.835
They're not in his jacket.

00:41.367 --> 00:43.039
- It starts tomorrow at 10.
- Thank you.

00:43.207 --> 00:44.686
Hey, Marty, what are
you doing here?

00:44.847 --> 00:47.122
They're dragging me out
to buy some new clothes.

00:47.287 --> 00:49.642
We're taking him to Rudolfo's
once-a-year sale.

00:49.847 --> 00:51.644
It's 50 percent off.
The alterations are free.

00:51.847 --> 00:53.883
Big deal. Butz Clothiers,
they do that every day.

00:54.047 --> 00:58.199
Yes, not to mention the convenience
of getting your pizza right next door.

00:58.407 --> 01:00.318
These guys think I have
bad taste in clothes.

01:00.527 --> 01:01.676
I like the way you dress.

01:01.887 --> 01:03.843
That's what's called the "clincher."
Shall we go?

01:05.126 --> 01:08.676
All right. Well, I'll just hit the head,
and we can get it over with.

01:08.847 --> 01:10.439
Dad, you could show
more enthusiasm.

01:10.607 --> 01:11.596
- Yeah.
MARTIN: Okay.

01:11.847 --> 01:14.759
Gee, I can't wait to hit the head,
and we can get it all over with!

01:19.287 --> 01:21.118
Are you finished undressing him
with your eyes?

01:21.327 --> 01:22.999
Please. I'm already
looking for my stockings

01:23.167 --> 01:25.635
and trying to remember
where I parked my car.

01:26.847 --> 01:28.758
I would have thought that gentleman
over there

01:28.927 --> 01:30.679
in the flannel shirt
would be more your type.

01:30.847 --> 01:33.236
Him? Not a chance.

01:33.527 --> 01:35.165
See the way he's slurping
his orange juice?

01:35.327 --> 01:37.124
Sloppy kisser.

01:37.447 --> 01:39.677
Now, you can tell right away
the guy is no good in bed.

01:39.847 --> 01:41.360
He's so cautious.

01:41.567 --> 01:44.240
Look at the way he's blowing
on his coffee.

01:51.167 --> 01:54.921
I wasn't trying to cool it,
I was simply blowing a foam hole.

01:55.487 --> 01:57.523
You don't even wrinkle
the sheets, do you?

01:58.807 --> 02:01.879
Niles, that man across the street
at the newsstand.

02:02.047 --> 02:03.366
Is that who I think it is?

02:03.567 --> 02:04.841
He does look familiar.

02:05.047 --> 02:06.924
- It's T.H. Houghton.
- No!

02:07.087 --> 02:10.044
<i>Just think back to the picture on the
dust cover of his Time Flies Tomorrow.</i>

02:10.207 --> 02:12.357
<i>- A little older, greyer...
- Yeah, Time Flies Tomorrow.</i>

02:12.527 --> 02:13.562
I read that in high school.

02:13.727 --> 02:15.365
- What else did he write?
FRASIER: Nothing.

02:15.567 --> 02:18.240
That's the crux of his legend.
The man published one masterpiece,

02:18.407 --> 02:20.875
and in the 30 years since,
he's become a virtual recluse.

02:21.047 --> 02:24.164
- Oh, my God. It is T.H. Houghton.
- Yes.

02:24.367 --> 02:27.165
We're a stone's throw away
from one of the giants of literature.

02:27.367 --> 02:28.880
Not the way you throw.

02:30.007 --> 02:31.440
Oh, Niles, this is incredible.

02:31.607 --> 02:34.565
My God, the man's entire life is
shrouded in mystery, yet there he is.

02:34.727 --> 02:35.876
I've always idolized him.

02:36.047 --> 02:37.685
What I wouldn't give
to meet that man.

02:37.887 --> 02:39.320
Why don't you go introduce yourself.

02:39.527 --> 02:41.677
Oh, I can't just walk up
to a god like that.

02:41.887 --> 02:43.479
Well, then find a subtler way.

02:43.687 --> 02:46.247
In your vernacular, that would
be what? To slingshot your panties

02:46.407 --> 02:47.556
across the street?

02:47.927 --> 02:51.078
- Foam blower.
- All right, all right, you two.

02:52.127 --> 02:53.446
Niles, she happens to be right.

02:53.847 --> 02:56.236
How often do you get an opportunity
like this? Let's go.

02:56.447 --> 02:58.005
All right.

02:58.167 --> 02:59.964
- Come on, we're going.
- Why? What's the rush?

03:00.127 --> 03:01.879
- T. H. Houghton is across the street.
- Who?

03:02.087 --> 03:05.159
- Come on, let's... Let's go!
MARTIN: Hey, guy with a cane here!

03:12.887 --> 03:15.196
Niles, I thought you said you saw
Houghton come in here.

03:15.367 --> 03:18.200
Well, I'm sorry if my tracking skills
aren't up to your standard.

03:18.407 --> 03:19.840
Instead of asking for a baby brother,

03:20.007 --> 03:22.601
you should have asked for a
German short-haired pointer.

03:23.007 --> 03:23.996
I did.

03:25.727 --> 03:27.285
Well, I'm sorry.

03:27.447 --> 03:28.926
He must still be out on the street.

03:29.127 --> 03:30.765
I'm parking it.
They got the Mariners on.

03:30.927 --> 03:33.316
- Please, we can't waste time.
- Let him be. He's deadweight.

03:33.527 --> 03:34.516
FRASIER:
Right.

03:38.127 --> 03:41.437
- What's the score?
- Four to three, Mariners.

03:42.207 --> 03:43.526
BOTH:
Aw!

03:44.167 --> 03:47.159
- How could he miss the cut-off man?
- That man makes 7 million a year.

03:47.327 --> 03:48.646
- It's crazy.
- Yeah.

03:48.807 --> 03:52.641
See him scratching his butt?
That's about 5 grand right there.

03:53.127 --> 03:55.687
- Let me have a Ballantine's.
- Yeah, make it two.

03:56.007 --> 03:57.725
BOTH:
Aw!

04:00.447 --> 04:02.483
So that's your favourite character?

04:02.647 --> 04:03.796
- Really?
- Yeah.

04:04.007 --> 04:07.238
Yeah, I really like him. The kind of guy
you can just sit and have a beer with.

04:07.447 --> 04:11.406
Well, I could see you saying that
about Hoss, but Little Joe?

04:12.287 --> 04:14.926
<i>That's the great thing about Bonanza.
Something for everyone.</i>

04:16.966 --> 04:19.083
Well, thank you, Mr False Alarm.

over at the yogurt store!

04:21.327 --> 04:23.318
Oh, look, there he is,

04:23.487 --> 04:25.955
Oh, look, there he is with Dad!"

04:26.927 --> 04:28.519
NILES:
And now he's leaving.

04:28.727 --> 04:30.445
I must tell him what an impact
his book has made.

04:30.607 --> 04:32.120
Aren't you afraid
it'll sound unoriginal?

04:32.287 --> 04:33.481
- Why?
- I'm gonna say it first.

04:33.647 --> 04:35.319
MAN: Excuse me, Mr Houghton?
- Yeah?

04:35.527 --> 04:39.156
- I just wanted to tell you that...
- My book changed your life. Swell.

04:39.607 --> 04:42.075
- No, no, but I...
- It changed mine too. Look, I'm sorry.

04:42.287 --> 04:45.006
I don't like to discuss my work.

04:47.167 --> 04:48.919
Well, that was humiliating.

04:49.087 --> 04:50.805
I've never felt so rejected in my life.

04:51.007 --> 04:52.281
Now, now, don't take it so hard.

04:52.447 --> 04:53.846
Who was to know
he was so sensitive?

04:54.047 --> 04:57.517
- Aren't you Dr Crane from the radio?
- Not now, haven't got the time, sorry.

04:58.847 --> 05:00.678
Do you realize who you were
just talking to?

05:00.847 --> 05:02.519
- That was T. H. Houghton.
- Yeah, I know.

05:02.727 --> 05:04.797
Well, well, well,
what did you two talk about?

05:04.967 --> 05:07.242
- Oh, I don't know. This and that.
FRASIER: Dad,

05:07.447 --> 05:09.483
virtually nothing is known
about this man.

05:09.647 --> 05:11.080
Can't you give us
something specific?

05:11.287 --> 05:15.485
Well, it was just guy stuff, you know.
Baseball, TV shows, old war stories...

05:15.687 --> 05:17.086
- He told war stories?
- No, I did.

05:17.247 --> 05:19.807
You know, about the time I made
the stew and the platoon got sick.

05:19.967 --> 05:21.605
Dad, how could you?

05:21.807 --> 05:23.320
What? He liked it.

05:23.487 --> 05:25.717
He's a nice guy. I think maybe
I'll buy one of his books.

05:25.927 --> 05:29.158
Not books, Dad. Book.

05:29.327 --> 05:30.316
Book.

05:30.527 --> 05:33.121
He wrote one book
and never wrote again.

05:33.327 --> 05:35.966
If only we'd arrived ten minutes earlier,
we could've talked to him.

05:36.167 --> 05:38.362
We could have explored
that mammoth intellect.

05:38.567 --> 05:42.276
Can you imagine the torture the man's
endured, to peak at such an early age?

05:42.447 --> 05:45.120
Oh, my God, Frasier, look.
It's a doodle!

05:45.287 --> 05:46.800
Not just any doodle,
a Houghton doodle.

05:47.007 --> 05:47.996
- It's mine!
- No, mine!

05:48.167 --> 05:49.680
- It's mine.
- Dad, what do you care?

05:49.887 --> 05:50.922
No, I mean I drew it.

05:54.367 --> 05:55.959
That's very touching. This is for you.

05:56.167 --> 05:57.441
Bye-bye.

05:59.447 --> 06:01.403
I don't know when I've enjoyed
an exhibit more.

06:01.567 --> 06:05.082
The artist's choice to make that a
monochrome was a stroke of genius.

06:05.287 --> 06:07.323
- It conveyed such despair.
FRASIER: Yes.

06:07.527 --> 06:10.246
It was so refreshing
to see a sad peach.

06:11.127 --> 06:12.401
How about that curator?

06:12.607 --> 06:14.006
She was kind of a peach herself.

06:14.567 --> 06:16.876
- No cubism there, I don't think.
- No, certainly not.

Nice meeting you fellas.

Oh, my God, we missed him again!

- That's odd.

06:43.047 --> 06:44.878
So where are you two going?

Well, Ted's taking me out to this
bratwurst place he knows.

Bratwurst? Yummy.
My God, that's our favourite.

we'll call the front...

No, Daphne.

07:28.887 --> 07:31.560

ended up in my apartment?

Well, he's only in town
for a couple of days,

07:33.887 --> 07:35.525
and he doesn't know
too many people,

07:35.687 --> 07:37.803
so he looked your father up,
gave him a ring,

07:37.967 --> 07:40.925

to watch the Mariners game.

07:41.927 --> 07:43.599
- He was here all afternoon?
DAPHNE: Yes.

07:43.807 --> 07:45.684
Oh, it's a shame you
couldn't be here,

07:45.847 --> 07:48.759
because he told
the most fascinating stories.

07:48.927 --> 07:52.237
And, of course, he and your father
are getting on like old chums.

07:52.447 --> 07:54.677
But the sweetest thing
was how he took to Eddie.

10:29.607 --> 10:31.438
They play two games.

10:34.047 --> 10:35.036
Oh, hi, Niles.

10:35.207 --> 10:38.279
Oh, Dad, so I hear that
Mr Houghton is on his way over.

10:38.487 --> 10:39.920
Maybe we could all have lunch.

10:40.127 --> 10:42.561
- That's a splendid idea.
- No, the game starts in 45 minutes.

10:42.727 --> 10:44.558
Perhaps you could come by
after for a drink.

10:44.727 --> 10:46.638
No, sorry, that won't work either.

10:46.847 --> 10:49.600
He's gotta go to his publisher's,
drop off his new book.

10:51.127 --> 10:52.116
Houghton has a new book?

10:52.327 --> 10:54.318
I've lost the feeling in my legs.

10:59.247 --> 11:02.125
Well, did he say anything about it?
I mean, the characters, the setting?

11:02.327 --> 11:04.921
- No, he just said it was a book.
- Dad.

11:05.087 --> 11:06.202
You have to skip the game.

11:06.367 --> 11:07.516
It's not just for our benefit.

11:07.687 --> 11:10.724
After all this baseball, the man must
be starved for intellectual stimulation.

11:10.927 --> 11:11.962
I know what you're saying.

11:12.127 --> 11:14.357
That someone like that would
prefer to spend time with you

11:14.527 --> 11:16.245
instead of some dumbbell like me.

11:16.447 --> 11:18.756
Dad, you're not dumb.
You missed the point entirely.

11:19.247 --> 11:21.442
Let's just say, for example,
you came home one afternoon

11:21.607 --> 11:23.643
and I was sitting here
discussing literature with,

11:23.807 --> 11:25.604
I don't know, give me the name
of a player.

11:25.927 --> 11:28.885
- Darryl Strawberry.
- No, a real one!

11:29.647 --> 11:31.603
Frasier, the problem is
you push too hard.

11:31.767 --> 11:34.406
We just talk sports,
have a few laughs. That's all.

11:34.567 --> 11:35.556
[DOORBELL RINGING]

11:35.727 --> 11:37.558
You know,
I never ask him about his work.

11:37.727 --> 11:39.843
That's probably why he told me
about the book.

11:43.727 --> 11:45.797
- Mr Houghton, hello.
- Hi, how you doing?

11:46.007 --> 11:48.202
- Hey, Ted, come on in.
HOUGHTON: Fine.

11:48.367 --> 11:50.642
FRASIER: So you two boys are
off to the baseball game, huh?

11:51.127 --> 11:52.242
Double-header.

11:52.447 --> 11:54.005
That's two games.

11:56.527 --> 11:57.880
Yeah.

11:58.767 --> 12:00.519
Little-known fact about baseball.

12:00.847 --> 12:05.079
The owner of the Boston Red Sox sold
Babe Ruth to the New York Yankees

12:05.247 --> 12:08.603
<i>to finance a Broadway musical,
No, No, Nanette.</i>

12:11.647 --> 12:14.400
- You ready, Marty?
- Let's go.

12:15.087 --> 12:17.043
Well, I really enjoyed chatting
with you.

12:17.207 --> 12:21.086
If you'd drop back by after the game,
we could pick up where we left off.

12:21.807 --> 12:24.241
<i>No, No, Nanette?</i>

12:26.527 --> 12:28.404
NILES: I'm sorry,
there were exactly two things

12:28.567 --> 12:30.762
I could possibly add
to a baseball conversation.

12:30.927 --> 12:32.406
That and...

12:32.607 --> 12:34.279
No, just the one.

12:38.407 --> 12:40.443
- Frasier?
- Yes.

12:40.767 --> 12:43.804
Have you noticed how Houghton carries
a satchel with him wherever he goes?

12:44.007 --> 12:46.680
Well, actually,
as a matter of fact, I have, yes.

12:46.887 --> 12:49.447
Didn't Dad mention that Houghton
was on his way to his publisher's

12:49.607 --> 12:51.643
after the game
with a new manuscript?

12:51.847 --> 12:52.836
Yes.

12:53.047 --> 12:56.323
Wouldn't that be the very same satchel
which is now resting under my head?

12:57.607 --> 12:59.438
Oh, my God!

13:00.287 --> 13:02.118
- Wait!
- Should we?

13:02.847 --> 13:03.996
We shouldn't.

13:04.207 --> 13:06.323
- Could we live with ourselves if we did?
- Could we live with ourselves

13:06.487 --> 13:08.079
- if we didn't?
- Could we live either way?

13:08.287 --> 13:09.879
Oh, stop it, Niles!

13:10.087 --> 13:11.725
Oh, who are we kidding? All right.

13:11.927 --> 13:13.918
Careful, careful, careful.

13:25.927 --> 13:30.398
<i>"The Chameleon's Song
by T. H. Houghton."</i>

13:32.087 --> 13:33.839
These are handwritten corrections.

13:34.047 --> 13:36.686
Frasier, this is his
original manuscript.

13:36.887 --> 13:39.321
Shame on you!

13:40.567 --> 13:43.718
Going through someone else's
personal property.

13:43.927 --> 13:45.838
Well, it's just plain wrong.

13:46.047 --> 13:47.799
And I know your father
wouldn't approve.

13:48.007 --> 13:50.441
Of course, I wouldn't be here
to tell him if I had the day off.

13:50.647 --> 13:52.478
- Fine, go.
- Oh, great.

13:56.527 --> 14:00.042
Of course, having a day off
is pretty meaningless

14:00.207 --> 14:01.925
when you have no money to,
you know,

14:02.127 --> 14:05.119
maybe go to lunch
or do some shopping.

14:05.487 --> 14:09.162
Perhaps take in a show. Oh, thanks.

14:11.687 --> 14:14.520
- All right, Niles, shall we?
- Not yet.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.962
- The atmosphere has to be perfect.
- Good point, yes.

14:17.127 --> 14:19.197
Let's begin with the lighting.

14:19.367 --> 14:21.323
All right, just say when.

14:22.567 --> 14:24.159
Warmer.

14:24.887 --> 14:26.161
Warmer.

14:27.207 --> 14:28.765
A little cooler.

14:29.247 --> 14:30.760
A touch warmer.

14:30.967 --> 14:32.559
A hair back.

14:32.887 --> 14:35.606
No, no, just...
No, a hair the other way.

14:35.807 --> 14:38.844
No, a touch warmer.

14:40.287 --> 14:41.686
- Perfect.
- Good.

14:45.647 --> 14:49.117
NILES: Excellent, excellent. What wine
would most enhance the experience?

14:49.287 --> 14:51.721
No, Niles.
Wine might dull our faculties.

14:51.887 --> 14:56.597
Perhaps instead a slow-sipping cordial
would be the proper garnish.

14:56.807 --> 14:58.763
- Sherry.
- Armagnac.

14:59.327 --> 15:02.125
Oh, well, see?
That's why you're the older brother.

15:11.207 --> 15:13.038
[SIGHS]

15:13.207 --> 15:16.404
- What is it?
- I don't think you're there yet.

15:19.487 --> 15:20.556
[SIGHS]

15:34.767 --> 15:36.086
[SIGHS]

15:40.087 --> 15:41.486
[SIGHS]

15:44.127 --> 15:45.355
Well, it's a masterpiece.

15:45.527 --> 15:46.516
[BARKS]

15:46.687 --> 15:48.245
Eddie.

15:48.447 --> 15:50.085
I never thought I'd utter these words,

15:50.247 --> 15:53.478
<i>but it actually surpasses
Time Flies Tomorrow.</i>

15:53.687 --> 15:54.881
[BARKING]

15:55.047 --> 15:56.639
Eddie, please!

15:57.047 --> 15:59.117
We're trying to savour the moment.

16:10.727 --> 16:12.604
How was the game?

16:14.247 --> 16:15.362
Is that my manuscript?

16:15.527 --> 16:16.801
What the hell's going on?

16:17.007 --> 16:18.486
HOUGHTON:
You went through my bag?

16:18.687 --> 16:21.645
- That's my personal property.
- I don't believe you two.

16:22.647 --> 16:26.322
Mr Houghton, we...
We are terribly, terribly sorry.

16:26.487 --> 16:28.239
The temptation to read it
was just too great.

16:28.407 --> 16:30.045
Oh, what's that supposed to mean?

16:30.207 --> 16:32.357
You're grown men,
at least I thought you were.

16:32.527 --> 16:34.643
You had no right to touch that.

16:34.807 --> 16:37.162
Ted, I'm sorry.
I'm just so ashamed.

16:37.327 --> 16:39.158
- Now, it's all right.
- No, it's not all right.

16:39.327 --> 16:41.079
No, no, it's okay, really.

16:41.247 --> 16:43.602
Somebody had to read it first.

16:44.447 --> 16:47.245
So, what did you think?

16:48.007 --> 16:50.043
- Of the book?
- No, of my typing.

16:50.207 --> 16:51.640
Yes, of course, the book.

16:56.327 --> 16:57.396
It was great.

16:58.807 --> 17:00.035
Wow.

17:01.807 --> 17:04.958
Well, at least you liked it.
I'm gonna have to be running.

17:05.166 --> 17:06.839
Are you sure?
I was gonna make some coffee.

17:07.047 --> 17:09.083
No, no, I got an appointment.
Can I use the?

17:09.287 --> 17:11.039
- It's right here.
HOUGHTON: Okay.

17:13.767 --> 17:15.439
Boy, I've had it with you guys.

17:15.646 --> 17:17.478
If you were Hoss and Little Joe,

17:17.646 --> 17:22.323
Ben Cartwright would kick your sorry
butts right off the Ponderosa!

17:22.926 --> 17:24.280
Dad.

17:27.047 --> 17:28.685
Dad, we're sorry.

17:28.847 --> 17:29.916
Very sorry.

17:34.047 --> 17:36.515
He's back on the Cartwrights again.

17:37.287 --> 17:40.677
You know, someday we really should
ask him just who the hell they are.

17:42.807 --> 17:46.482
You know, Niles, one thing
just really bugs me.

17:46.687 --> 17:49.884
Houghton's gonna leave thinking we're
just a couple of inarticulate simpletons.

17:50.047 --> 17:52.481
What were those pithy comments
we made about his masterpiece?

17:52.687 --> 17:54.962
- "It was great."
BOTH: "Wow."

17:55.127 --> 17:58.324
<i>Yes, we'll go down in history with the
same boob who first read Hamlet,</i>

17:58.487 --> 18:02.321
then told Shakespeare, "My goodness,
what a parchment-turner!"

18:03.367 --> 18:05.597
Well, it's not too late.
He hasn't left yet.

18:06.287 --> 18:08.755
Yes, yes, we could still say
something to show him

18:08.927 --> 18:11.487
that we appreciated the
full complexity of his work.

18:13.807 --> 18:16.275
Mr Houghton, you know,
there is one further thing

18:16.447 --> 18:18.517
- I'd like to add about your book.
- Yeah.

18:18.727 --> 18:21.287
Well, it's the way you modulated
into the second-person narrative

18:21.447 --> 18:25.122
during the flashback scene. Frankly,
beggars anything Faulkner attempted.

18:25.327 --> 18:27.158
Really? That's very flattering.

18:27.847 --> 18:29.917
Oh, wait, I have one too.

18:30.607 --> 18:32.199
The way you so skilfully mirrored

18:32.367 --> 18:34.483
<i>the structure of Dante's
Divine Comedy was inspired.</i>

18:34.847 --> 18:35.836
Really?

18:36.007 --> 18:37.838
FRASIER:
Yes, from the inferno of the bordello...

18:38.007 --> 18:40.521
NILES: Which, we noticed,
had exactly nine rooms.

18:40.727 --> 18:43.400
- To the purgatory
of the assembly line,

18:43.567 --> 18:46.764
and finally to the paradise
of the farm.

18:47.647 --> 18:49.000
You both saw that?

18:49.167 --> 18:50.725
Oh, it practically jumped
off the page.

18:50.887 --> 18:53.196
Well, that's very perceptive of you.

18:53.407 --> 18:55.682
Well, thank you.
I guess it's our turn to be flattered.

18:55.887 --> 18:57.923
You're absolutely right.

18:58.247 --> 19:00.681
This whole book is crap.

19:00.887 --> 19:01.876
Beg your pardon?

19:02.087 --> 19:03.406
How could I be so blind?

19:03.567 --> 19:06.604
I lifted the entire structure
from Dante!

19:07.087 --> 19:09.840
- You mean you weren't going for that?
- Of course not!

19:10.047 --> 19:12.038
This confirms my worst fear.

19:12.247 --> 19:14.477
I have nothing original left to say.

19:14.687 --> 19:16.006
I'm an empty shell.

19:16.207 --> 19:18.243
I was a fool to think I had
a second book in me!

19:18.407 --> 19:21.046
"The winters were harsh
on the farm."

19:21.247 --> 19:24.398
Well, here's something
to warm them up!

19:24.567 --> 19:26.159
MARTIN:
What's going on here?

19:26.327 --> 19:27.316
You're both right.

19:27.527 --> 19:29.643
I'm a talentless hack
who got lucky once.

19:29.847 --> 19:32.042
- We didn't say that!
- You're not listening to them?

19:32.247 --> 19:34.807
- Look at this trash! It won't burn!
- It's a fireplace, you see.

19:34.967 --> 19:37.845
- It's not well ventilated.
- This doesn't belong in a fireplace.

19:38.407 --> 19:42.036
It belongs in the gutter,
with the rest of society's garbage!

19:42.207 --> 19:44.357
FRASIER: Wait. No, no...
MARTIN: Ted, don't do that!

19:44.527 --> 19:47.121
- Ted, no! Don't do it!
NILES: No, Mr Houghton...

19:53.287 --> 19:54.925
I want to thank you two.

19:55.247 --> 19:58.557
If I had published that book, my
reputation would have been destroyed.

19:58.727 --> 20:02.356
At least now I'm left
with a shred of dignity.

20:04.967 --> 20:06.286
No.

20:06.847 --> 20:08.246
MARTIN:
Happy?

20:08.407 --> 20:10.398
Hey, Ted, wait up!

20:18.367 --> 20:21.439
Well, we've destroyed a man's life.

20:22.007 --> 20:26.205
Not to mention depriving
future generations of a work of art.

20:26.367 --> 20:28.642
Yes, well, on the other hand,
had he actually published it,

20:28.807 --> 20:32.800
the critics surely would've noticed
that Dante parallel.

20:33.527 --> 20:35.802
If he felt bad now, imagine how
he would've felt reading it

20:35.967 --> 20:38.435
<i>- in The New York Review of Books.
- Oh, God, yes.</i>

20:38.647 --> 20:41.241
Given his fragile ego, my God,
he would've been devastated.

20:41.407 --> 20:43.159
Who knows what
he might have done.

20:44.727 --> 20:46.206
Do you know, Niles,

20:46.687 --> 20:48.837
we saved that man's life.

20:49.887 --> 20:52.321
Yes, I think you're right.

20:53.367 --> 20:56.086
- On the other hand...
- Don't go there.

20:58.887 --> 21:01.720
See, that's why
you're the older brother.
