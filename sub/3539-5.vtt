[Sir Malcolm] <i>Previously on</i>
Penny Dreadful...

00:01.708 --> 00:04.375
It's an autobiography.
The memoirs of the Devil.

00:04.427 --> 00:06.461
It's possible he wasn't
just recounting the past

00:06.513 --> 00:08.012
but foretelling the future.

00:08.048 --> 00:09.847
- Whose future?
- Yours.

00:09.883 --> 00:11.966
Your wounds
were likely inflicted

00:12.002 --> 00:14.002
by some sort of animal claw.

00:14.037 --> 00:17.005
<i>Will you describe what
happened at the Mariner's Inn?</i>

00:17.040 --> 00:19.073
I don't remember.

00:19.109 --> 00:21.309
- [Lily] <i>Who was he?</i>
- [Frankenstein] <i>Your intended.</i>

00:21.311 --> 00:22.727
- [Lily] To marry?
- Yes.

00:22.779 --> 00:25.313
- Must I love him now?
- That's for you to say.

00:25.315 --> 00:27.315
[Dorian]
<i>You're raising a few eyebrows.</i>

00:27.367 --> 00:29.817
- You don't mind?
- Let them stare.

00:29.853 --> 00:33.538
- Does this corset flatter me?
- Yes.

00:33.573 --> 00:36.541
It's my cousin, you see,
she's coming to visit me

00:36.576 --> 00:39.077
and she's a simple girl,
from the country, you know?

00:39.129 --> 00:40.628
Your cousin, how lovely.

00:40.664 --> 00:41.963
[Lyle] <i>Who's the lucky lady?</i>

00:41.998 --> 00:43.831
You know her, in fact.
Mrs. Poole.

00:43.883 --> 00:45.500
Oh, yes,
our clairvoyant friend.

00:45.535 --> 00:47.885
Well,
proceed with caution, eh?

00:47.921 --> 00:50.972
We have no more children
for you to kill.

00:51.007 --> 00:52.340
[Sir Malcolm] <i>About my wife...</i>

00:52.392 --> 00:54.926
- Will you divorce?
- That's impossible.

00:54.978 --> 00:56.427
I appreciate
your honesty, Malcolm.

00:56.479 --> 00:58.513
<i>And it's always good to
have something to aim at.</i>

00:59.315 --> 01:01.683
Do you truly not
believe in heaven?

01:01.718 --> 01:03.317
We are accountable
to no one but each other.

01:03.353 --> 01:05.687
That's a profound
responsibility.

01:05.722 --> 01:07.321
I'll prepare the enchantment
for tonight.

01:07.357 --> 01:08.956
- You know what to bring me?
- Yes.

01:08.992 --> 01:10.692
Don't disappoint me
again, girl.

01:10.727 --> 01:13.111
You'll understand
I find it difficult to accept

01:13.163 --> 01:15.863
I'm the object
of an eternal Satanic quest.

05:47.270 --> 05:49.603
[Ethan] I know what a siege
is like. I've been there.

05:50.673 --> 05:52.540
You get the enemy
when they're relaxed

05:52.575 --> 05:54.742
and making dinner
or feeding their babies.

05:54.811 --> 05:57.645
You get them concentrated
in one location,

05:57.697 --> 05:59.947
you surround them,
and then you attack

05:59.983 --> 06:01.582
with every weapon
at your disposal

06:01.617 --> 06:03.417
until every one of them
is dead.

06:12.628 --> 06:14.045
[Sir Malcolm]
When were you in a siege?

06:14.080 --> 06:15.663
During the Indian Wars.

06:15.665 --> 06:17.381
I was seconded
to a cavalry unit

06:17.417 --> 06:18.916
that had as its goal

06:19.002 --> 06:21.168
the annihilation
of the Apaches.

06:21.204 --> 06:23.971
Dress it up any way you want,
that's what it was.

06:27.010 --> 06:29.593
We were in the southern part
of the Arizona Territory

06:29.645 --> 06:31.345
and there's one little tribe

06:31.397 --> 06:33.247
we're supposed to send
to the reservation

06:33.282 --> 06:35.483
or murder, didn't matter.

06:35.518 --> 06:37.618
They were dug in
on a Cliffside.

06:38.955 --> 06:40.921
We moved in at night,

06:40.957 --> 06:43.190
with our horses' hooves
wrapped in burlap.

06:43.226 --> 06:45.559
We surrounded them
very slowly.

06:46.696 --> 06:49.030
Hours of getting
into position.

06:49.632 --> 06:52.950
Some of us lucky ones
who spoke Chiricahua

06:53.002 --> 06:54.735
infiltrated the village.

06:54.771 --> 06:57.738
We stood in the darkness
20 feet away

06:57.774 --> 07:02.009
while they talked
and smoked and made dinner.

07:03.546 --> 07:05.429
They had no idea.

07:05.465 --> 07:07.548
They thought they were safe.

07:08.618 --> 07:10.251
They had underestimated

07:10.286 --> 07:12.653
the ruthlessness
of their enemies.

07:14.557 --> 07:15.656
Sound familiar?

07:16.626 --> 07:18.025
What happened?

07:18.061 --> 07:20.361
One bugle call
and we attacked.

07:20.396 --> 07:23.397
We didn't talk.
We didn't negotiate.

07:25.118 --> 07:26.951
My squad worked
from the inside out.

07:26.986 --> 07:28.536
They had nowhere to run.

07:29.572 --> 07:33.074
In 15 minutes... that tribe
had ceased to exist.

07:34.961 --> 07:37.661
They were wiped from history.

07:39.916 --> 07:43.017
We can't let ourselves
be infiltrated and surrounded.

07:45.421 --> 07:47.121
We defend our cliff.

07:49.358 --> 07:51.358
And we know what they want.

07:51.394 --> 07:53.477
Yes. That we know.

07:54.647 --> 07:57.264
[Ethan]
Now if we only knew why.

07:57.316 --> 07:59.300
They're making a fetish.

07:59.335 --> 08:00.801
Which is?

08:00.837 --> 08:03.187
- A voodoo doll.
- [Vanessa] Very like.

08:03.239 --> 08:05.773
The Nightcomers
value simulacra...

08:05.825 --> 08:07.158
those things that take

08:07.193 --> 08:08.609
the appearance
of other things,

08:08.611 --> 08:10.661
so as to more easily
enchant them.

08:10.696 --> 08:12.663
Your hair.

08:12.698 --> 08:15.199
So they got
what they came for.

08:16.035 --> 08:17.251
Utterly.

08:18.454 --> 08:20.688
[Sembene]
I know totems like these.

08:20.723 --> 08:22.756
It is the most important thing

08:22.792 --> 08:25.259
to have the flesh
of the enemy.

08:25.294 --> 08:26.794
Consume it...

08:28.714 --> 08:30.898
you take their power.

08:30.933 --> 08:33.299
What do we know
about these creatures?

08:34.386 --> 08:36.169
We're safe during the day...

08:36.205 --> 08:38.572
they're only transformative
by night.

08:38.607 --> 08:40.407
How do we protect ourselves?

08:40.443 --> 08:42.308
There is lore
to ward off witches.

08:42.345 --> 08:43.611
And rituals.

08:43.645 --> 08:46.614
And sturdy locks
and a shitload of weapons.

08:48.317 --> 08:50.618
Every weapon
at our disposal...

08:50.653 --> 08:53.871
every superstition...
every ritual.

08:55.558 --> 08:57.324
We defend our cliff.

09:03.666 --> 09:05.833

12:51.293 --> 12:52.943
[door opening]

12:52.978 --> 12:55.396
I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

12:56.732 --> 12:58.565
- What is it?
- [sniffles]

12:58.567 --> 13:00.033
They were here.

13:00.069 --> 13:02.319
[stammering]
No, they weren't here.

13:03.205 --> 13:05.372
I can't tell anymore.

13:05.408 --> 13:06.907
Take it easy,
you're all right.

13:06.909 --> 13:08.659
[stammering]
I thought I saw them,

13:08.711 --> 13:10.210
but they weren't there.

13:10.246 --> 13:11.578
I can't tell the difference,

13:11.630 --> 13:14.047
whether they're real
or in my head.

13:15.484 --> 13:17.918
I can't live
with this anymore. [sniffling]

13:17.970 --> 13:19.286
But they're in my prayers now.

13:19.321 --> 13:22.289
Shh. It's okay.
You're safe here.

13:22.324 --> 13:23.424
Safe?

13:27.096 --> 13:29.146
I wish I were going mad.

13:29.181 --> 13:30.764
Then the doctors
could lock me away

13:30.816 --> 13:32.182
and cut out the madness.

13:32.234 --> 13:33.851
Anything to make it end.

13:34.987 --> 13:36.987
You know the true path
to freedom?

13:37.022 --> 13:38.439
Open any vein.

13:38.491 --> 13:40.274
That you can't do.

13:40.276 --> 13:42.860
No. [sniffles] God has a plan.

13:44.447 --> 13:46.079
God has a plan.

13:50.619 --> 13:53.003
May I sleep here tonight?

13:53.038 --> 13:54.621
Of course.

13:54.623 --> 13:56.840
You think me foolish, I know.

13:57.293 --> 13:59.359
No. No such thing.

14:01.597 --> 14:04.264
I know what it is
to be scared of the dark.

14:05.167 --> 14:07.801
Sofa's pretty comfortable.
I'll be fine.

14:20.649 --> 14:22.483
You were praying.

14:24.904 --> 14:27.454
- Old habits.
- Don't lie to me.

14:28.374 --> 14:30.707
I know you believe
in the word of God.

14:43.222 --> 14:45.639
I believe we make ourselves
who we are.

14:47.009 --> 14:48.892
The blood's on our hands,
not God's.

14:50.012 --> 14:52.646
And did you make yourself
into who you are?

14:54.049 --> 14:55.415
The first time
I picked up a gun

14:55.451 --> 14:58.919
and decided my life was more
important than anyone else's.

15:00.122 --> 15:02.322
You never go back from that.

15:02.358 --> 15:04.725
And are you sure
that wasn't part of His plan?

15:05.861 --> 15:07.694
You've never killed anyone.

15:09.064 --> 15:10.464
Talk to me then.

15:19.375 --> 15:21.208
Whatever you have done...

15:21.260 --> 15:23.627
whoever you have
made yourself...

15:23.679 --> 15:25.212
I'm here to accept you.

15:26.131 --> 15:28.265
We're together for a reason.

15:30.953 --> 15:32.286
God's plan?

15:35.090 --> 15:36.290
Yes.

15:39.728 --> 15:41.395
You need to sleep.

16:08.173 --> 16:10.173
May we leave the candles?

16:12.728 --> 16:14.027
All night.

16:40.289 --> 16:41.622
Enough.

16:41.674 --> 16:44.324
I have lived with
your evasions too long.

16:44.360 --> 16:47.044
Don't think I can't look into
your wretched black heart

16:47.096 --> 16:48.929
and see the machinations
laid bare!

16:48.964 --> 16:51.515
Then do as you like!
I'm done with it.

16:51.550 --> 16:54.801
Go rampaging up there like
the unholy monster you are

16:54.853 --> 16:57.137
and let the consequences
be on your head.

16:59.775 --> 17:01.775
I'm powerless to stop you.

17:04.896 --> 17:06.863
- [grunting]
- Yes.

17:06.898 --> 17:08.815
Whatever power
you held over me

17:08.867 --> 17:11.785
at the moment of
my bestial creation is gone.

17:11.819 --> 17:14.320
But then you had a power,
Frankenstein.

17:14.323 --> 17:16.073
Had you only used it kindly,

17:16.125 --> 17:18.575
what a different story
we would be telling.

17:18.627 --> 17:20.042
[choking]

17:21.296 --> 17:23.163
I will see her.

17:27.002 --> 17:28.468
Then go.

17:31.507 --> 17:33.090
You know the way.

17:47.122 --> 17:49.256
What have you
told her about me?

17:49.291 --> 17:50.490
No more than you know.

17:50.526 --> 17:52.259
She thinks
you were her fiance

17:52.294 --> 17:55.328
before the "accident"
that robbed her of her memory.

17:56.365 --> 17:57.597
And...

17:59.668 --> 18:01.668
how did you paint me?
How did you...

18:02.805 --> 18:04.738
limn the story of our romance?

18:04.773 --> 18:06.173
I told her nothing.

18:07.476 --> 18:10.293
I thought it best
you extemporize on that.

18:12.047 --> 18:14.715
And her response
when you spoke of me?

18:14.767 --> 18:16.416
She asked
if she loved you before.

18:16.452 --> 18:18.185
I said I didn't know.

18:18.220 --> 18:19.953
She asked
if she must love you now.

18:19.988 --> 18:22.589
I told her
it was up to her entirely.

18:23.358 --> 18:24.691
Was I wrong?

18:25.994 --> 18:27.694
- [loudly] Was I wrong?
- No. No.

18:29.698 --> 18:32.699
No, she must... care for me
of her own accord.

18:34.403 --> 18:35.635
[sighing]

18:43.829 --> 18:46.046
And did she speak of my face?

18:47.916 --> 18:49.750
- In what way?
- [gasps]

18:51.336 --> 18:53.553
[scoffs] Such sadism,
even now.

18:53.589 --> 18:55.972
She knows you look differently
than she or I.

18:57.176 --> 18:59.092
She's seen no one else.

19:01.930 --> 19:03.930
If you come
as the jolly wooer...

19:04.767 --> 19:06.433
I wish you luck.

19:06.435 --> 19:08.602
And I wish you, and she,
gone from my existence

19:08.654 --> 19:10.353
as if you had
never drawn breath.

19:10.405 --> 19:12.439
For once,
we are both in agreement.

19:13.358 --> 19:15.108
Then let it be done.

19:28.123 --> 19:29.956
[reading indistinctly]

19:36.381 --> 19:37.631
Cousin.

19:41.804 --> 19:43.970
Mr. Clare, good evening.

19:44.723 --> 19:45.889
Miss Lily.

19:46.892 --> 19:49.726
I've brought Mr. Clare
to entertain you for a bit.

19:50.646 --> 19:52.813
You must be bored
by my company.

19:55.450 --> 19:57.200
I'll leave you to it.

19:57.236 --> 19:59.286
Cousin Victor, you won't stay?

19:59.321 --> 20:01.655
I've... work downstairs.

20:02.908 --> 20:04.708
I'll come back.

20:10.916 --> 20:12.999
Won't you sit, sir?

20:14.336 --> 20:15.669
Thank you.

20:23.679 --> 20:25.011
[Lily sighs]

20:29.268 --> 20:31.568
And you may call me John,
if you will.

20:33.021 --> 20:35.121
- That's a lovely dress.
- What?

20:36.942 --> 20:39.025
Yes. Victor picked it out.

20:42.197 --> 20:44.130
And... do you like it?

20:45.167 --> 20:47.400
Yes. Victor picked it out.

20:52.941 --> 20:54.674
You're looking at my face.

20:54.710 --> 20:58.378
Uh... I don't mean to.
I can't help it.

21:00.849 --> 21:04.050
Kind eyes can look on anything
and find it beautiful.

21:04.052 --> 21:05.318
[stammers]

21:06.104 --> 21:09.105
[stammering] I don't mean
to be forward. I'm sorry.

21:12.644 --> 21:15.228
Ours is
an exceptional history.

21:17.449 --> 21:20.033
We were friends... once,
and...

21:21.036 --> 21:24.204
and that...
friendship grew between us.

21:24.239 --> 21:25.872
Victor told me.

21:25.908 --> 21:28.875
Well, let me tell you,
for I was there.

21:30.646 --> 21:32.779
I remember, one night,
we were walking

21:32.814 --> 21:34.464
through the village...

21:34.499 --> 21:36.883
and we came across some men
outside a tavern,

21:36.919 --> 21:38.468
drunken they were.

21:40.422 --> 21:42.505
And they saw me with you...

21:42.557 --> 21:45.642
and they laughed
and pointed and said,

21:45.677 --> 21:48.561
"How could the likes of her
be with the likes of him?"

21:49.998 --> 21:51.498
And what did you do?

21:52.167 --> 21:53.833
It was more what you did.

21:55.003 --> 21:58.038
You took my hand...
and you held it.

21:59.858 --> 22:01.574
And you looked at them.

22:03.412 --> 22:05.662
Then you raised
my hand to your lips...

22:08.550 --> 22:10.116
and you held it there.

22:10.168 --> 22:11.785
I don't remember.

22:14.423 --> 22:16.756
- And yet it happened.
- To someone else.

22:19.127 --> 22:21.294
I've no wish
to cause you pain.

22:22.214 --> 22:24.681
Let us start
by being friends, Mr. Clare.

22:24.716 --> 22:26.383
I can do no other.

22:32.274 --> 22:33.556
I understand.

22:35.110 --> 22:36.609
[Lily sniffling]

22:53.729 --> 22:55.962
[breathing deeply]

23:25.527 --> 23:28.028
- [Gladys struggling]
- [Madame Kali] <i>Lucifer.</i>

23:28.080 --> 23:30.697
[Madame Kali speaking
demonic language]

23:33.702 --> 23:35.251
[screaming]

23:37.706 --> 23:40.373
[continues speaking
demonic language]

23:48.100 --> 23:50.050
[screaming]

24:09.287 --> 24:11.738
[Rusk clears throat]
Mr. Chandler?

24:16.461 --> 24:17.911
Who's asking?

24:20.665 --> 24:23.967
Inspector Bartholomew Rusk...
Scotland Yard.

24:26.471 --> 24:28.555
I should like a few words,
if I may.

24:32.928 --> 24:34.094
You may.

24:36.431 --> 24:38.815
Perhaps my office
would be more comfortable?

24:40.936 --> 24:42.185
For whom?

24:44.823 --> 24:46.106
This way.

25:06.461 --> 25:08.011
[Frankenstein] Miss Ives.

25:08.046 --> 25:09.129
Doctor.

25:09.181 --> 25:11.764
May I present
Miss Lily Frankenstein.

25:12.717 --> 25:14.217
Such a pleasure, miss.

25:14.269 --> 25:16.519
Your cousin
has told me so much.

25:16.555 --> 25:18.555
How do you do, Miss Ives?

25:41.663 --> 25:43.496
What's the one thing
a sharpshooter

25:43.548 --> 25:44.998
is sure to need?

25:46.801 --> 25:48.218
[Ethan grunting]

25:48.887 --> 25:50.003
Bullets.

25:51.056 --> 25:53.556
I've given up
the theatrical profession.

25:53.592 --> 25:54.557
Oh, why?

25:55.260 --> 25:57.927
It didn't suit my character.

25:57.979 --> 26:02.432
Yes... I see you don't
seem made for the limelight.

26:02.484 --> 26:04.684
- Then again, we've just met.
- Indeed.

26:09.241 --> 26:11.741
One wonders how you keep
body and soul together...

26:12.994 --> 26:14.527
without employment.

26:14.579 --> 26:16.696
[Ethan]
Bit of this, bit of that.

26:23.038 --> 26:25.038
I lost it in the Transvaal.

26:25.090 --> 26:26.756
Boer sharpshooter.

26:27.709 --> 26:29.375
I think a carbine.

26:29.411 --> 26:31.211
They never use
long-barreled weapons,

26:31.246 --> 26:33.146
they are so frequently
on horseback.

26:34.316 --> 26:37.617
Much like your, um...
Red Indians, yes?

26:38.119 --> 26:39.586
Is that right?

26:39.621 --> 26:42.889
I mean, you must know weapons,
given your former occupation.

26:42.891 --> 26:46.259
Just the theatrical kind.
I'm not that good a shot.

26:46.294 --> 26:48.561
We used shotgun pellets
in the show.

26:48.563 --> 26:51.531
Well... these aren't pellets.

26:52.534 --> 26:54.284
And I'm not in the show.

26:56.571 --> 26:58.488
You lived
in the Mariner's Inn.

26:58.540 --> 26:59.706
Did I?

27:00.542 --> 27:04.444
You registered
September 25th last year.

27:05.330 --> 27:06.713
[Ethan] Must have then.

27:07.999 --> 27:10.583
- Where do you live now?
- Elsewhere.

27:12.721 --> 27:15.054
Are you aware of the recent
trouble at the inn?

27:15.090 --> 27:16.506
No.

27:16.558 --> 27:18.224
Don't you read the newspapers?

27:18.260 --> 27:19.509
No.

27:22.430 --> 27:23.796
There were murders.

27:23.832 --> 27:25.431
- Were there?
- Many.

27:26.067 --> 27:27.300
Shame.

27:27.335 --> 27:29.636
All of the guests at the inn
have been accounted for

27:29.671 --> 27:31.988
but for one... Brona Croft

27:32.023 --> 27:35.074
and one... Ethan Chandler.

27:37.329 --> 27:39.279
- And?
- And...

27:41.249 --> 27:44.450
- I am bound to ask.
- And am I bound to answer?

27:44.452 --> 27:46.352
Well, you haven't
been remanded.

27:46.388 --> 27:49.055
- Am I free to leave?
- Any time you like.

27:58.099 --> 28:00.717
We've had some trouble
here in London.

28:00.769 --> 28:03.136
It started in early
September last year.

28:03.188 --> 28:04.504
Is that so?

28:04.539 --> 28:06.139
According to customs records,

28:06.191 --> 28:09.809
that was when you arrived
with your Wild West show.

28:09.811 --> 28:12.278
September 3rd,
to be precise.

28:13.898 --> 28:15.398
How can I help?

28:15.450 --> 28:17.016
You can tell me
why an American

28:17.085 --> 28:18.785
who is seemingly
without employment

28:18.820 --> 28:21.738
and a place of residence
and proficient in firearms

28:21.790 --> 28:23.539
is currently buying ordinance.

28:24.326 --> 28:27.377
- Is it illegal?
- Not in the slightest.

28:27.412 --> 28:29.462
Were the people
who were killed shot?

28:29.497 --> 28:31.047
Not a one.

28:31.082 --> 28:32.832
Well, then, I'm not quite sure

28:32.884 --> 28:34.550
what I'm doing here,
Inspector Rusk.

28:34.636 --> 28:36.085
Because...

28:39.808 --> 28:41.174
you're a mystery.

28:42.110 --> 28:45.378
- And you don't like mysteries.
- I like order.

28:46.648 --> 28:48.731
And peaceable streets
upon which to walk.

28:49.851 --> 28:51.100
As do I.

28:52.187 --> 28:53.269
[exhales sharply]

28:53.321 --> 28:56.439
There was something different
about the Mariner's Inn.

28:57.158 --> 28:59.158
There was a survivor.

29:01.329 --> 29:03.196
That must be useful to you.

29:03.248 --> 29:04.781
Well, people who were there

29:04.833 --> 29:06.733
seem to have a way
of forgetting things.

29:06.768 --> 29:08.468
Well, it was
a forgettable place.

29:09.637 --> 29:10.837
Not to me.

29:12.340 --> 29:14.173
- What's your name?
- You know my name.

29:14.209 --> 29:16.476
I know your stage name.

29:16.511 --> 29:18.711
We've been cabling
our American colleagues

29:18.763 --> 29:20.847
for information
on an "Ethan Chandler"

29:20.882 --> 29:23.216
with few useful results
thus far.

29:23.268 --> 29:26.269
I have reams of documents
on a farmer in Iowa,

29:26.304 --> 29:29.522
and a cotton grower
in Louisiana...

29:29.557 --> 29:32.642
and... a chemist in New York.

29:35.897 --> 29:38.448
All men... without mystery.

29:39.567 --> 29:41.984
That must be frustrating
for you.

29:43.238 --> 29:44.737
Only temporarily.

29:45.740 --> 29:48.157
Well, since I have
nothing to tell you...

29:49.160 --> 29:50.293
- [clears throat]
- Of course.

29:50.328 --> 29:52.245
Do you mind
if I walk with you?

29:52.247 --> 29:54.497
I never seem to get
any air in this job.

29:54.549 --> 29:55.748
My pleasure.

29:56.718 --> 29:58.634
He's been very generous.

29:58.670 --> 30:00.336
Yes, the doctor is a kind man.

30:00.388 --> 30:02.755
I think that rather comes
with the job.

30:08.146 --> 30:10.730
And... are you intending
to remain in London?

30:11.649 --> 30:12.815
As long as she likes.

30:12.851 --> 30:14.600
As long as he'll have me.

30:16.688 --> 30:20.022
Makes a... change
from the country at any rate.

30:22.193 --> 30:25.194
And... how do you
find London, Lily?

30:27.499 --> 30:28.948
The weather is challenging,

30:28.950 --> 30:31.117
but the excitement
is palpable.

30:36.925 --> 30:38.374
There's a lot to explore here.

30:38.426 --> 30:40.193
Have you seen much
of the city?

30:41.596 --> 30:44.130
Just the... usual
tourist spots mostly.

30:44.632 --> 30:46.332
[Lily] It's very loud.

30:46.718 --> 30:48.718
Loud. That's silly. Sorry.

30:48.770 --> 30:51.687
No, no, you're right.
The din is everlasting.

30:56.394 --> 30:57.693
I think
that's probably enough.

30:57.729 --> 31:00.029
Sorry. [laughing]
These are fun.

31:00.064 --> 31:02.482
[chuckling] They are indeed.

31:04.869 --> 31:07.153
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I've an engagement.

31:08.122 --> 31:10.907
I do hope we'll see you at
Grandage Place soon, Doctor.

31:10.959 --> 31:12.658
- We miss you.
- Of course.

31:14.295 --> 31:17.580
Such a pleasure, Lily.
I hope we'll meet again.

31:17.632 --> 31:19.298
You're very pretty.

31:19.334 --> 31:22.084
Well, thank you. As are you.

31:22.136 --> 31:23.970
And thank you for the dress.

31:24.005 --> 31:25.388
[mock whispering]
Next time we'll go alone.

31:25.423 --> 31:27.340
I think the doctor
was mortified.

31:29.310 --> 31:31.344
- Good day to you both.
- Miss Ives.

31:36.684 --> 31:39.185
Did I do all right, Victor?

31:39.187 --> 31:40.853
You were perfect.

31:54.586 --> 31:57.336
[Rusk] It's never what
you think it's going to be.

31:57.372 --> 31:59.455
We expected a proper
military engagement

31:59.507 --> 32:01.757
but the Boers
didn't play along.

32:03.011 --> 32:05.461
There we were
in our formations...

32:05.513 --> 32:07.179
and our scarlet uniforms

32:07.215 --> 32:10.216
while they were a guerilla
force who struck at will.

32:10.268 --> 32:12.518
Never seen better
on horseback.

32:13.521 --> 32:15.805
Like the Sioux Indians
in your country.

32:15.857 --> 32:17.056
I read about them
in dime novels.

32:17.058 --> 32:19.392
Your accent
isn't from the East.

32:20.645 --> 32:22.395
Aren't you a Westerner?

32:22.447 --> 32:24.363
You've been to America?

32:25.400 --> 32:26.782
I have an ear.

32:28.069 --> 32:30.453
Works with the ladies.
Who doesn't love a cowboy?

32:30.488 --> 32:33.406
- Or a soldier.
- I suppose.

32:34.826 --> 32:36.208
Your War Department
hasn't been

32:36.244 --> 32:38.244
particularly forthcoming
with records.

32:38.246 --> 32:40.997
Too busy invading Haiti
and killing Red Indians

32:41.049 --> 32:43.416
at the moment I should think.

32:43.468 --> 32:44.917
But I'll keep at it.

32:44.919 --> 32:46.168
You do that.

32:47.305 --> 32:49.005
It's been a pleasure,
Inspector.

32:49.057 --> 32:51.557
But I've got shopping to do
if you'd excuse me?

32:52.510 --> 32:53.759
Of course.

32:56.648 --> 32:58.314
Be careful, Mr. Chandler.

33:02.487 --> 33:04.103
With the bullets.

33:06.024 --> 33:07.356
Inspector.

33:13.164 --> 33:14.530
Excuse me.

33:34.852 --> 33:36.185
[woman] Thank you.

33:41.025 --> 33:42.558
[Vanessa] Mr. Clare.

33:43.811 --> 33:45.144
[Mr. Clare] Miss Ives.

33:45.813 --> 33:48.114
Do you know you share
your name with a dead poet?

33:49.233 --> 33:50.566
Yes. [chuckles]

33:51.903 --> 33:53.219
Do you like poetry?

33:53.254 --> 33:55.321
All sad people like poetry.

33:55.323 --> 33:57.156
Happy people like songs.

33:57.191 --> 33:58.991
[both chuckle]

34:02.030 --> 34:04.664
I've always been moved
by John Clare's story.

34:06.334 --> 34:09.101
By all accounts he was
only five feet tall, so...

34:09.137 --> 34:10.735
considered freakish.

34:12.340 --> 34:15.741
Perhaps due to this, he felt
a singular affinity with...

34:15.777 --> 34:17.943
the outcasts
and the unloved...

34:19.414 --> 34:22.947
the ugly animals...
the broken things.

34:25.253 --> 34:26.485
"I am

34:27.889 --> 34:30.856
yet what I am
none care or knows.

34:33.393 --> 34:36.295
My friends forsake me
like a memory lost.

34:38.132 --> 34:40.666
I am the self-consumer
of my woes.

34:42.003 --> 34:45.036
They rise and vanish
in oblivious host,

34:45.072 --> 34:49.408
like shadows in love's
frenzied stifled throes.

34:50.911 --> 34:53.411
And yet I am, and live..."

34:54.815 --> 34:56.482
[both] "Like vapors tossed..."

34:58.453 --> 35:01.954
"I long for scenes
where man hath never trod.

35:03.091 --> 35:06.492
A place where woman
never smiled or wept.

35:07.895 --> 35:10.596
There to abide
with my Creator, God.

35:11.666 --> 35:15.134
And sleep as I in childhood
sweetly slept.

35:15.737 --> 35:19.138
Untroubling and untroubled
where I lie."

35:20.675 --> 35:24.510
[both] "The grass below,
above, the vaulted sky."

35:31.385 --> 35:33.719
I wonder
if he ever found it...

35:33.755 --> 35:35.521
his silent place with God.

35:37.525 --> 35:40.226
Oh, the poem tells me
that he did.

35:40.928 --> 35:42.661
As you will one day.

35:44.632 --> 35:45.865
Peace.

35:46.801 --> 35:49.168
- [scoffs]
- Is that the goal of religion?

35:49.203 --> 35:50.402
Isn't it?

35:51.472 --> 35:54.306
That can be found in
the smallest details of life.

35:55.710 --> 35:56.976
The kind touch of a hand.

35:58.980 --> 36:00.446
I saw it earlier.

36:01.783 --> 36:03.649
I was having coffee
with a friend.

36:03.684 --> 36:04.817
He's in love with someone,

36:04.852 --> 36:06.218
though I don't know
he knows it.

36:06.254 --> 36:08.888
But... she touched his hand.

36:10.525 --> 36:11.624
And on his face...

36:13.461 --> 36:15.161
something
I'd never seen before.

36:16.230 --> 36:17.997
A kind of peace, anyway.

36:19.734 --> 36:21.333
The cruelest kind.

36:22.804 --> 36:24.637
It's lethal, that touch...

36:26.541 --> 36:29.341
for it leaves your heart
at the mercy of another.

36:31.979 --> 36:33.679
You're so unprotected.

36:36.150 --> 36:38.184
We're all awkward in love.

36:39.687 --> 36:41.654
Mine has always gone awry.

36:41.689 --> 36:43.706
When I have opened myself
to it in the past,

36:43.741 --> 36:46.659
it's left me... damaged.

36:47.829 --> 36:49.712
The consequences
are too grave.

36:50.431 --> 36:52.431
And what is our recompense?

36:52.466 --> 36:55.267
We who cannot
cast our boats on that sea?

36:56.070 --> 36:57.536
And how are we
to navigate the waters

36:57.572 --> 36:59.271
when they are so alien?

37:04.412 --> 37:07.880
I've... met a woman
recently, in fact.

37:10.284 --> 37:13.152
But I don't know
how to behave.

37:13.187 --> 37:14.920
- As yourself.
- [scoffs]

37:14.956 --> 37:16.455
Or as anything but.

37:17.425 --> 37:19.692
I'm so maladroit, Miss Ives.

37:21.295 --> 37:24.163
[sighs] I can speak poetry
to the end of days, but...

37:25.900 --> 37:28.334
I cannot take her hand
in this hand,

37:28.369 --> 37:30.536
so... pale and ugly.

37:33.474 --> 37:35.541
All the stratagems
of the battle

37:35.576 --> 37:37.243
are unknown to me.

37:39.013 --> 37:42.097
When to laugh... how to laugh.

37:43.217 --> 37:47.519
How to stand and sit
and bow and dance.

37:48.606 --> 37:50.389
Ah, there at least,
I can help.

37:52.143 --> 37:54.393
See this woman
in me, Mr. Clare,

37:54.395 --> 37:56.612
and follow your heart.

37:56.647 --> 37:58.364
It's the curse of my class.

38:00.067 --> 38:02.451
I was taught dancing
from a very young age.

38:03.988 --> 38:06.288
Oh, no. [stammering]
Please, I can't.

38:06.324 --> 38:07.823
- Come on.
- No.

38:08.743 --> 38:11.944
Mr. Clare...
the sea is waiting for you.

38:11.979 --> 38:13.329
Set sail.

38:34.352 --> 38:36.268
And try not to look
at your feet.

38:37.438 --> 38:40.572
Follow gently in this,
as you do in all things.

38:44.195 --> 38:45.995
One, two, three.

38:46.948 --> 38:48.414
One, two, three.

38:49.750 --> 38:51.283
[chuckling]

38:52.169 --> 38:53.669
One, two, three.

38:54.705 --> 38:56.288
[both chuckling]

39:26.704 --> 39:28.153
[bell ringing]

39:37.465 --> 39:39.748
[unlocking bolts]

39:51.429 --> 39:55.564
<i>â™ª</i>

39:59.103 --> 40:01.236
[audience applauding]

40:02.523 --> 40:04.940
[indistinct conversations]

40:07.528 --> 40:10.279
I'm sorry, I...
I think it's highly improper.

40:11.198 --> 40:13.032
They're brother
and sister after all!

40:13.034 --> 40:15.417
So I finally found something
that shocks you.

40:15.453 --> 40:16.702
If it were possible
for me to blush,

40:16.704 --> 40:18.170
I'd be as red as an apple.

40:18.205 --> 40:19.755
[man] God, it can't be.

40:20.841 --> 40:22.925
- I know you.
- Oh, I think not.

40:22.960 --> 40:24.960
Oh, yes. Hold on.

40:25.012 --> 40:27.212
This is the little minx
I told you about.

40:27.264 --> 40:28.964
In Belgravia!

40:29.016 --> 40:30.849
- Excuse us.
- Hold on, friend.

40:30.885 --> 40:34.019
This is the little freak
that took Â£40 off me.

40:34.055 --> 40:36.138
Quite a surprise in store
for yours truly.

40:36.190 --> 40:38.690
- Wasn't there, dear heart?
- Take your hand off me.

40:39.593 --> 40:41.393
Or maybe you like
that kind of thing, friend.

40:42.063 --> 40:43.145
[man grunts]

40:54.625 --> 40:56.575
- [gasps]
- [men chuckling]

41:06.754 --> 41:08.003
[sniffling]

41:08.055 --> 41:10.339
[people talking indistinctly]

41:13.561 --> 41:15.260
It's a complete myth.

41:16.180 --> 41:18.430
Quicksand can't actually
swallow you up.

41:18.516 --> 41:19.982
You can struggle
and get trapped

41:20.017 --> 41:21.600
for a while, that's all.

41:22.570 --> 41:23.969
It's just like love.

41:25.072 --> 41:26.905
Better not to struggle, dear.

41:26.941 --> 41:30.075
I can honestly say I've never
met a woman like you.

41:31.862 --> 41:34.113
You have no idea.

41:37.701 --> 41:40.085
You're a breath of air
in a complicated life.

41:41.288 --> 41:45.424
Well... let's hope
we can simplify it someday.

41:50.681 --> 41:52.965
Oh. Here's your brandy.

41:54.802 --> 41:56.135
- [Sir Malcolm] Ow!
- Oh!

41:56.137 --> 41:58.387
Oh, my ring pricked you,
I'm sorry.

41:58.439 --> 42:00.272
Oh, it's ridiculous, jewelry.

42:01.192 --> 42:03.475
Foul baubles of our vanity,
aren't they?

42:04.645 --> 42:06.528
You were saying, dear?

42:15.489 --> 42:17.289
[Lyle] Well, I'm damned!

42:18.492 --> 42:19.992
Well, I'm sure of that.

42:20.027 --> 42:22.127
[chuckling]

42:22.163 --> 42:23.996
Mr. Chandler, you dazzle me.

42:24.748 --> 42:27.216
I always expect you to be
so fiendishly manly

42:27.251 --> 42:29.334
and then out come
these soupcons of wit.

42:29.386 --> 42:31.503
- You inspire me, Mr. Lyle.
- [laughs]

42:32.339 --> 42:34.506
So, what's damning you
tonight?

42:34.558 --> 42:36.842
Well, look at this.
Our narrative...

42:36.894 --> 42:38.760
proceeds along
at a stately pace

42:38.846 --> 42:42.347
without a trace of Dickensian
flourish or Thackerayan japery

42:42.399 --> 42:44.516
and then I come across this...

42:44.568 --> 42:47.102
a phrase, repeated
in a variety of languages,

42:47.154 --> 42:48.353
seemingly at random,

42:48.405 --> 42:51.323
like a poetic repetition
I can't make fit anywhere.

42:51.358 --> 42:53.025
- I'm boggled.
- What is it?

42:54.028 --> 42:55.527
Here it is in Greek...

42:56.780 --> 42:58.447
[speaking Greek]

42:59.700 --> 43:01.533
And in Latin...

43:03.454 --> 43:04.836
<i>Lupus Dei.</i>

43:05.739 --> 43:07.105
The Hound of God.

43:08.092 --> 43:10.092
Or something very like.

43:10.127 --> 43:12.928
Sir Malcolm will have to
help us with the Arabic.

43:14.215 --> 43:16.298
I can't endure
dangling repetitions.

43:16.350 --> 43:19.768
It's like a...
poem waiting to be rhymed.

43:19.803 --> 43:21.386
It makes me sad.

43:23.274 --> 43:25.891
But we'll get it,
Mr. Chandler...

43:25.893 --> 43:27.643
for we are what, above all?

43:28.445 --> 43:30.062
I haven't a clue.

43:31.065 --> 43:32.197
Tenacious.

43:33.284 --> 43:36.735
We keep after our quarry
until he, she, or it is ours.

43:42.142 --> 43:43.875
[Ethan] The Hound of God.

43:55.639 --> 43:57.556
I borrowed your clothes.

44:01.312 --> 44:02.894
Why are you doing this?

44:02.930 --> 44:04.496
Being what I am?

44:05.332 --> 44:07.199
That's not what you are.

44:07.935 --> 44:09.501
You prefer the freak.

44:10.638 --> 44:12.404
It adds spice for you,
doesn't it?

44:13.691 --> 44:14.990
From the moment I was born,

44:15.025 --> 44:17.109
I was not
as I was meant to be.

44:18.412 --> 44:20.212
No one spoke of it.

44:20.247 --> 44:22.948
My parents ignored me
as best they could.

44:24.118 --> 44:26.251
So I came to London
and created Angelique...

44:26.787 --> 44:29.988
leaving me fit for no trade
but whoring...

44:30.024 --> 44:33.892
and myself fit for nothing
but degradation and ridicule.

44:35.663 --> 44:37.329
Have you ever known that?

44:38.499 --> 44:39.598
No.

44:40.734 --> 44:42.668
You've led
a charmed life here.

44:43.437 --> 44:44.970
We're not all so lucky...

44:46.206 --> 44:47.339
or so normal.

44:49.576 --> 44:51.209
Do you think
I don't understand

44:51.245 --> 44:52.778
what it is to be different?

44:53.681 --> 44:56.348
I think I'm tired, Dorian.

44:57.885 --> 45:00.986
I've been fighting so long.

45:14.301 --> 45:16.051
You're not fighting alone...

45:18.088 --> 45:19.388
Angelique.

45:20.174 --> 45:23.008
And if I chose always
to dress like this?

45:24.845 --> 45:27.179
Would you care for me then?

45:28.916 --> 45:30.716
I care for who you are...

45:32.519 --> 45:33.819
not what you wear.

45:47.618 --> 45:48.667
[thunder rumbling]

45:48.702 --> 45:51.203
[Sir Malcolm and
Madame Kali laughing]

45:51.255 --> 45:52.621
[Sir Malcolm] Quickly!

45:54.425 --> 45:55.874
[laughter continues]

46:12.276 --> 46:14.226
- I'm sorry, Mrs. Poole.
- You mustn't be.

46:14.228 --> 46:15.927
[stammers] I don't know
what got into me.

46:15.963 --> 46:17.696
Must be the Wagner.

46:17.731 --> 46:18.780
No...

46:19.566 --> 46:20.732
not that.

46:30.994 --> 46:32.794
I have to be with you.

46:34.581 --> 46:35.580
Yes.

46:44.057 --> 46:45.390

52:01.658 --> 52:03.475

- It's all right.

52:05.128 --> 52:08.046
Don't worry, you're safe.

52:09.466 --> 52:10.832
You're safe.

52:11.885 --> 52:13.218
Thank you, Victor.
