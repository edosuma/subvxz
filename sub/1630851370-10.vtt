00:02.698 --> 00:04.265
<i>Back in the '80s,</i> <i>
my brother, Barry,</i> <i>
loved imitating his heroes.</i>

00:04.439 --> 00:06.658
<i>From whip-wielding adventurers
on-screen</i>

00:06.832 --> 00:09.270
<i>to python-flexing</i> <i>
champions of the ring,</i>

00:09.444 --> 00:10.923
<i>he couldn't help</i> <i>
but see himself</i>

00:11.098 --> 00:12.577
<i>in their action-packed</i> <i>
exploits.</i>

00:12.751 --> 00:15.841
<i>But there was one suave
super-spy who topped them all.</i>

00:16.016 --> 00:18.366
Bond. James Bond.

00:18.540 --> 00:20.020
That's how
he introduces himself.

00:20.194 --> 00:21.891
I love how even after
almost being murdered,

00:22.065 --> 00:24.154
he's wildly flirty.

00:24.328 --> 00:26.678
"Welcome, sir,
I'm Jenny Flex."

00:26.852 --> 00:27.810
Her name is
kinda suggestive.

00:27.984 --> 00:29.638
Yeah, good stuff.

00:29.812 --> 00:31.683
You guys said
you'd eat some popcorn
if I got the big tub.

00:31.857 --> 00:33.772
And now my delicate tummy
is upset with all of you.

00:33.946 --> 00:35.426
We told you
not to get it.

00:35.600 --> 00:36.993
It's only 50 cents more
for the rodeo barrel.

00:37.167 --> 00:39.561
Wait. Adam hasn't
praised the movie yet.

00:39.735 --> 00:41.171
Why aren't you
still clapping

00:41.345 --> 00:42.216
and/or demanding
to see it again?

00:42.390 --> 00:43.652
Yeah, it was neat.

00:43.826 --> 00:44.914
"Neat" is
something you say

00:45.088 --> 00:46.698
after uncomfortably
watching

00:46.872 --> 00:47.699
your little brother'sperformance in <i>The King and I.</i>

00:47.873 --> 00:49.658
How dare you?

00:49.832 --> 00:51.312
One critic
said my performance
was so inappropriate

00:51.486 --> 00:53.140
- he couldn't look away.
- Just say you loved it

00:53.314 --> 00:54.837
so I can stop
being scared of
his furrowed brow.

00:55.011 --> 00:56.012
Look, the fight on
the Eiffel Tower was fun,

00:56.186 --> 00:58.014
but what villain
uses a blimp?

00:58.188 --> 00:59.276
I think we can all agree

00:59.450 --> 01:00.538
it's a bad choice
for a getaway vehicle.

01:00.712 --> 01:03.628
Blimp technology
is in its infancy.

01:03.802 --> 01:05.369
We don't know
what tomorrow will bring.

01:05.543 --> 01:06.762
Hopefully an end
to this conversation.

01:06.936 --> 01:08.111
Well, I spent
the whole time

01:08.285 --> 01:10.287
lost in dreamboat
Roger Moore's
blue eyes.

01:10.461 --> 01:12.550
He got my Aston Martin
a-revvin'.

01:12.724 --> 01:14.639
Exactly.
Wait. What?

01:14.813 --> 01:16.424
The only plot hole was
there weren't more women

01:16.598 --> 01:17.294
jumping his British bones.

01:17.468 --> 01:19.383
But he was so old.

01:19.557 --> 01:20.950
Like over 50.

01:21.124 --> 01:22.734
Maybe you didn't notice,

01:22.908 --> 01:23.996
but he took
a lot of elevators
in this one.

01:24.171 --> 01:26.477
Whatever Grandpa Bond's doing,
it's working.

01:26.651 --> 01:27.565
Double oh, yeah.

01:27.739 --> 01:28.914
Brea, how about you?

01:29.089 --> 01:30.568
You hot
for the spy guy?

01:30.742 --> 01:32.614
Mm, I prefer a softer man
who plays it safe.

01:32.788 --> 01:34.659
Ouch, but also whoo-hoo!

01:34.833 --> 01:36.792
Could Roger Moore
do this?
Secret agent kick!

01:36.966 --> 01:39.099
My bucket!

01:39.273 --> 01:41.144
<i>♪ I'm twisted up inside</i>

01:41.318 --> 01:43.886
<i>♪ But nonetheless</i> <i>
I feel the need to say</i>

01:47.019 --> 01:48.760
<i>♪ I don't know the future</i>

01:48.934 --> 01:52.503
<i>♪ But the past keeps getting</i> <i>
clearer every day ♪</i>

01:52.677 --> 01:54.505
It was January 5th, <i>
1980-something,</i>

01:54.679 --> 01:56.159
<i>and just like</i> <i>
she did at home,</i>

01:56.333 --> 01:57.552
<i>my mom was</i> <i>
stopping by the store</i>

01:57.726 --> 01:59.815
<i>to clean up after my dad.</i>

01:59.989 --> 02:01.817
- Aah!
- Aah!

02:01.991 --> 02:04.254
Damn it, Mike.
You scared me.

02:04.428 --> 02:05.603
Sorry. My night face
has been described as

02:05.777 --> 02:07.475
both waxy and ashy.

02:07.649 --> 02:08.432
Two words that seem to
fight each other,

02:08.606 --> 02:09.259
but what are you
gonna do?

02:09.433 --> 02:10.782
Why are you here?

02:10.956 --> 02:12.567
I'm just working late
and fighting gingivitis.

02:12.741 --> 02:14.395
- Are you living here?
- Fine.

02:14.569 --> 02:15.744
I am temporarily
enjoying the perks

02:15.918 --> 02:17.267
of owning 30 mattresses

02:17.441 --> 02:18.834
because Fran and I
are separating.

02:19.008 --> 02:20.792
Oh, my God.

02:20.966 --> 02:22.664
But you're both
so young and vital.

02:22.838 --> 02:24.274
Vital? You kidding?

02:24.448 --> 02:25.406
Five years ago,
my doctor started saying,

02:25.580 --> 02:27.451
"Eh, it is what it is."

02:27.625 --> 02:30.280
What happened?
And I'm not just curious
for gossip purposes.

02:30.454 --> 02:33.240
I don't know.
I guess Fran just got sick
of my general way.

02:33.414 --> 02:34.676
That does have
a ring of truth to it.

02:34.850 --> 02:36.025
Yeah,
but it's not all bad.

02:36.199 --> 02:37.418
I mean, I got
top-of-the-line sleepers

02:37.592 --> 02:38.201
as far as
the eye can see.

02:38.375 --> 02:40.160
The commute is easy.

02:40.334 --> 02:41.378
And, I mean,
what more can a man ask for?

02:41.552 --> 02:43.728
Love? Companionship?
Connection?

02:43.902 --> 02:45.513
Ooh, ramen night again.

02:45.687 --> 02:46.992
Gotta tell ya, Bev,

02:47.167 --> 02:48.385
the Japanese have
really mastered

02:48.559 --> 02:50.170
the fine art
of microwave soup.

02:50.344 --> 02:53.042
<i>Arigato,</i>
my Far Eastern friends.

02:53.216 --> 02:55.087
Damn it, Mike.
Ditch the cardboard mush.

02:55.262 --> 02:57.481
You're coming home with me
for a home-cooked meal.

02:59.483 --> 03:01.746
Hey,
there's my work buddy.

03:01.920 --> 03:03.052
What's this one
doing here?

03:03.226 --> 03:05.272
Murray, that is no way
to greet a guest.

03:05.446 --> 03:07.709
Guest? Like I don't
see this guy enough
between 10:00 and 3:00?

03:07.883 --> 03:09.101
Those are your hours?

03:09.276 --> 03:10.755
How do you support us?

03:10.929 --> 03:12.801
Did you know he's been
sleeping at the store?

03:12.975 --> 03:14.890
He mentioned it.
Something about
his life falling apart.

03:15.064 --> 03:16.718
Do you even
listen to people
when they talk?

03:16.892 --> 03:19.068
Fine, I'll ask.
What's your deal,
Pajama Jim?

03:19.242 --> 03:20.765
Fran and I are taking
a little time apart.

03:20.939 --> 03:22.419
- And now I know.
- Okay, can you guys take

03:22.593 --> 03:24.595
your super strong friendship
somewhere else?

03:24.769 --> 03:25.727
I'm trying to
write my vows here.

03:25.901 --> 03:26.771
Vows? For what?

03:26.945 --> 03:28.599
My wedding?

03:28.773 --> 03:30.035
Wow, you guys really
don't talk.

03:30.210 --> 03:31.515
And that's why we're
the fourth-highest-grossing

03:31.689 --> 03:33.952
discount furniture store
in the township.

03:34.126 --> 03:35.215
That doesn't seem great.

03:35.389 --> 03:36.477
I'll tell you
what's not great,

03:36.651 --> 03:38.087
marriage.

03:38.261 --> 03:39.654
Here's a little notion
for your vows,

03:39.828 --> 03:42.047
love is a sham.

03:42.222 --> 03:44.311
Ignore him.
What have you got so far,
schmoopy-poo?

03:44.485 --> 03:46.661
"Dear Geoff.
'G' is for 'good.'

03:46.835 --> 03:48.793
"'E' is for 'even better.'

03:48.967 --> 03:51.100
"'O' is for 'Oh, dang,
that's my fella.'"

03:51.274 --> 03:52.580
- I'm gonna stop you.
- I'm gonna let you.

03:52.754 --> 03:54.146
Got a little something
for your poem.

03:54.321 --> 03:56.236
I buy Fran a beach house
in the hopes

03:56.410 --> 03:58.455
that I might buy myself
some moments of silence.

03:58.629 --> 04:00.240
But no.

04:00.414 --> 04:01.937
The only thing
busier than her mouth
are my credit cards.

04:02.111 --> 04:03.286
I'm gonna go
sit in a closet

04:03.460 --> 04:05.201
where his sad, dead love
can't get me.

04:05.375 --> 04:06.681
Hey, can I use
the john?

04:06.855 --> 04:08.465
I haven't showered
in days.

04:08.639 --> 04:10.598
I think I smell
of Entenmann's
and sadness.

04:10.772 --> 04:13.514
Upstairs.
The only door
that doesn't lock.

04:13.688 --> 04:15.907
Damn it, Murray.

04:16.081 --> 04:17.300
You can't just let
their marriage end like this.

04:17.474 --> 04:18.910
Oh, I can.

04:19.084 --> 04:20.564
But more importantly,
so can you.

04:20.738 --> 04:23.263
Too late.
I will repair
their broken marriage

04:23.437 --> 04:25.656
and prove to Erica
that true love is forever.

04:25.830 --> 04:27.789
Is this what it feels like
when I don't listen?

04:27.963 --> 04:29.443
Because I'm okay with that.

04:29.617 --> 04:31.183
Hey, I got all naked.
I couldn't find the towels.

04:31.358 --> 04:32.489
Is that our bedspread?

04:32.663 --> 04:34.274
Eh, it's somebody's.

04:34.448 --> 04:36.711
I have a lot of work
ahead of me.

04:36.885 --> 04:38.800
While my mom was determined <i>
to save Mike's marriage,</i>

04:38.974 --> 04:41.542
<i>Barry wanted me to help</i> <i>
celebrate his relationship.</i>

04:41.716 --> 04:42.717
Dang it.
One piece is missing.

04:42.891 --> 04:44.371
Uh, we get the gist.

04:44.545 --> 04:45.372
It's the green guy
from <i>Ghostbusters.</i>

04:45.546 --> 04:47.504
That's Slimer.
He's pure ectoplasm,

04:47.678 --> 04:50.028
and he's not
just a mascot,
he's a friend.

04:50.202 --> 04:52.901
You know, sometimes
it's okay to just say,
"That's right, Brea."

04:53.075 --> 04:54.598
- You're done with this.
- No!

04:54.772 --> 04:56.121
Hey, it's your brother.

04:56.296 --> 04:58.820
Enough small talk.
I have an emergency
announcement.

04:58.994 --> 05:00.604
Joanne and I
have been dating
for a few months,

05:00.778 --> 05:02.563
and I finally found her
the perfect gift.

05:02.737 --> 05:03.955
The gift of me.

05:04.129 --> 05:06.218
Barry. Barry Bond.

05:06.393 --> 05:07.307
Nephew of James Bond

05:07.481 --> 05:08.960
and worldly gentleman
super-spy

05:09.134 --> 05:10.875
and insatiable
and acrobatic lover.

05:11.049 --> 05:12.399
But those words
don't describe you.

05:12.573 --> 05:14.052
If anything,
you're the opposite
of James Bond.

05:14.226 --> 05:16.838
And you're the opposite of
the opposite of James Bond.

05:17.012 --> 05:18.622
So...
James Bond?

05:18.796 --> 05:20.407
Look,
I'm not here to discuss

05:20.581 --> 05:22.060
how confusing
opposites can get,
Dave Kim.

05:22.234 --> 05:23.584
I'm here to make great art.

05:23.758 --> 05:24.933
I'll bite.
What are you gonna
force us to do?

05:27.979 --> 05:30.460
The title is <i>You Only Die</i> <i>
Once or Twice,</i> <i>
But Never Three Times?</i>

05:30.634 --> 05:31.722
Your parts are highlighted.

05:31.896 --> 05:33.420
Brea, you are
the femme fatale.

05:33.594 --> 05:35.073
Why am I wearing a bikini
in the Swiss Alps?

05:35.247 --> 05:37.075
I justify it
on page seven.

05:37.249 --> 05:39.208
You were born in
a Russian genetics lab

05:39.382 --> 05:40.905
and you're half polar bear
from your father's side.

05:41.079 --> 05:42.559
I'm Q and Moneypenny?

05:42.733 --> 05:43.995
So much range.

05:44.169 --> 05:47.390
Explosive gadgets
and secretarial work.

05:47.564 --> 05:49.697
And I die in the first scene
by being filled with lead

05:49.871 --> 05:51.438
then pulled apart
by giant magnets?

05:51.612 --> 05:54.615
It's gruesome,
but necessary so I can
avenge your idiotic death.

05:54.789 --> 05:56.094
This is lazy writing.

05:56.268 --> 05:57.444
I refuse to change
a single word.

05:57.618 --> 05:59.054
Why is everyone
mischievous?

05:59.228 --> 06:00.577
The mischievous
manservant.

06:00.751 --> 06:01.839
The mischievous
baccarat dealer.

06:02.013 --> 06:03.450
The mischievous baby?

06:03.624 --> 06:05.495
It heightens the tension,
Dave Kim.

06:05.669 --> 06:06.757
Despite this
not fitting in with

06:06.931 --> 06:09.456
my usual light-hearted
cinematic tastes,

06:09.630 --> 06:10.805
I have always wanted
to dabble in the spy genre,

06:10.979 --> 06:12.894
- so we're in.
- We are?

06:13.068 --> 06:14.635
I'm part polar bear,
Adam.

06:14.809 --> 06:15.810
But only if
I handle the rewrite.

06:15.984 --> 06:18.116
Deal.

06:18.290 --> 06:20.467
<i>While my brother</i> <i>
was determined</i> <i>
to be the best Bond ever,</i>

06:20.641 --> 06:22.904
<i>my mom was intent on</i> <i>
fixing Mike's marriage.</i>

06:23.078 --> 06:24.122
Hello,
Murray Goldberg.

06:24.296 --> 06:25.776
Get out of
the papasan.

06:25.950 --> 06:27.865
I most certainly will not
get out of the papasan.

06:28.039 --> 06:29.911
I love the papasan.

06:30.085 --> 06:31.956
It is
my papa-sanctuary.

06:32.130 --> 06:33.697
Do not get involved
in Mike's marriage.

06:33.871 --> 06:35.220
I have a plan.

06:35.395 --> 06:37.658
See, the way to drive Mike
back into Franny's arms

06:37.832 --> 06:39.529
is to show him
what he's been missing.

06:39.703 --> 06:41.139
And how are you
gonna do that?

06:41.313 --> 06:43.707
By getting him
to date a woman
far worse than Fran.

06:43.881 --> 06:46.144
Beverly,

06:46.318 --> 06:49.147
why did you ask to meet me in
this off-season haunted house?

06:49.321 --> 06:51.280
This is my husband's
place of business.

06:51.454 --> 06:53.021
Remind me what he does
for work again,

06:53.195 --> 06:54.936
besides having to tell you
that he loves you.

06:55.110 --> 06:56.503
Save that gold.

06:56.677 --> 06:59.070
Oh, Mike,
you have a customer.

06:59.244 --> 07:00.507
Hello, miss,
may I help you
find something?

07:00.681 --> 07:02.334
Is there a door
closer than that one

07:02.509 --> 07:04.162
to leave this
godforsaken place?

07:04.336 --> 07:06.164
Mike, this is Jane.
Jane, Mike.

07:06.338 --> 07:08.166
How do you... Don't touch me
with that hand.

07:08.340 --> 07:10.952
You look like a man
who scratches everywhere.

07:11.126 --> 07:14.434
Bevy, your friend
is very mean
and very attractive.

07:14.608 --> 07:16.479
Hm, well, I don't see it,
but let's pretend yes.

07:16.653 --> 07:19.917
Um, you know,
Mike has recently
become single.

07:20.091 --> 07:21.658
Are you trying
to set us up?

07:21.832 --> 07:23.181
Have you seen me?

07:23.355 --> 07:24.531
I have the body
of a swimmer.

07:24.705 --> 07:26.184
He has the body
of someone

07:26.358 --> 07:27.751
they'd find face-down
in a river.

07:27.925 --> 07:29.623
I'm mesmerized.

07:29.797 --> 07:32.626
I have an idea.
Why don't
the two of you go

07:32.800 --> 07:34.541
and discuss all of the things
you don't have in common

07:34.715 --> 07:36.543
at China Garden.

07:36.717 --> 07:39.284
Fine. But only because
you think you're some
great matchmaker.

07:39.459 --> 07:40.721
I'll prove you wrong.

07:40.895 --> 07:42.157
Oh, no, don't do that.

07:42.331 --> 07:44.115
Shall we make
some mistakes?

07:44.289 --> 07:45.856
<i>And so,</i> <i>
it looked like my mom's plan</i>

07:46.030 --> 07:47.771
<i>to drive Mike back</i> <i>
into his wife's arms</i>

07:47.945 --> 07:49.947
<i>was gonna be a success.</i> <i>
Until it wasn't.</i>

07:50.121 --> 07:51.906
It was great!

07:52.080 --> 07:53.473
There's my steady beau.

07:53.647 --> 07:55.126
What?

07:55.300 --> 07:57.564
I hate to admit it, Beverly,
but you did it.

07:57.738 --> 08:00.001
Well, don't you
have some qualms?

08:00.175 --> 08:01.698
Oh, all of them.

08:01.872 --> 08:04.396
But despite
his unappealing nature
and shape,

08:04.571 --> 08:06.355
he made it quite clear of
his enormous wealth,

08:06.529 --> 08:08.052
so whee!

08:08.226 --> 08:09.793
Oh, my.

08:09.967 --> 08:11.926
What a unique pairing.

08:12.100 --> 08:13.580
Stick this
in your vows...

08:13.754 --> 08:15.582
Don't marry the first dummy
that comes along.

08:15.756 --> 08:18.323
Wait for the second dummy
who's smoking hot.

08:18.498 --> 08:21.631
And make sure the dummy's
ridiculously loaded.

08:21.805 --> 08:22.980
All right,
I'm so happy for you.
Bye.

08:23.154 --> 08:24.591
She wasn't.

08:24.765 --> 08:26.680
<i>Meanwhile,</i> <i>
Barry had finished his movie</i>

08:26.854 --> 08:29.378
<i>and was ready to show Joanne</i> <i>
how good of a Bond</i> <i>
he could be.</i>

08:29.552 --> 08:31.641
You are gonna love
this surprise.

08:31.815 --> 08:33.338
Ooh, I'm so excited.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.819
But why didn't you just
blindfold me with a necktie?

08:35.993 --> 08:38.518
I don't own one.
But I do own
two pirate's eyepatches.

08:38.692 --> 08:40.258
Ta-da!

08:40.432 --> 08:41.042
We're gonna
watch a movie?

08:41.216 --> 08:43.131
Oh, not just any movie.

08:43.305 --> 08:45.089
One made
especially for you.

08:45.263 --> 08:46.613
And it was gonna be epic.

08:46.787 --> 08:47.875
This summer,

08:48.049 --> 08:50.921
get ready for Bond,
Barry Bond... 0014.

08:51.095 --> 08:52.575
'Cause that's twice
as good as seven.

08:52.749 --> 08:54.098
Time to die,
Mr. Bond.

08:57.362 --> 08:59.190
The time to die is yours.

09:00.583 --> 09:02.977
It has it all... Action.

09:03.151 --> 09:05.066
<i>Romance.</i>

09:05.240 --> 09:07.851
<i>Style.</i>

09:08.025 --> 09:10.332
<i>Underwater stuff.</i>

09:10.506 --> 09:13.683
<i>And, of course,</i> <i>
the man himself.</i>

09:13.857 --> 09:17.339
Saving the world is easy.
What's hard is
looking this good doing it.

09:17.513 --> 09:18.514
Coming this summer

09:18.688 --> 09:20.342
<i>and every summer after.</i>

09:20.516 --> 09:21.996
<i>But her response,</i> <i>
not what he expected.</i>

09:22.170 --> 09:23.780
Oh, my God.

09:23.954 --> 09:25.086
Thank you for this.

09:25.260 --> 09:26.957
It was the perfect gift.

09:27.131 --> 09:28.872
Ooh, underwater stuff.

09:29.046 --> 09:30.961
- Yeah, underwater stuff.
- Ahh!

09:31.135 --> 09:33.224
I should go freshen up.
I peed myself a little.

09:41.624 --> 09:43.495
It had been a day since

09:43.670 --> 09:45.846
<i>Joanne's</i> <i>
underwhelming reaction</i> <i>
to Barry's Bond movie.</i>

09:46.020 --> 09:47.674
There's my Care Bear.

09:47.848 --> 09:49.545
Who's excited
to go mini-golf?

09:49.719 --> 09:51.721
You can be
your favorite,
red ball.

09:51.895 --> 09:54.376
Eh, I'm not really in the mood
for tiny versions of anything.

09:54.550 --> 09:56.726
Well, I'm a tiny version,
and you like me.

09:56.900 --> 09:58.249
For sure.
I'mma go take a nap

09:58.423 --> 10:00.425
in my childhood bedroom
where I feel safe.

10:00.600 --> 10:01.862
Even though
the samurai sword
above my bed

10:02.036 --> 10:04.125
would suggest otherwise.

10:04.299 --> 10:06.649
Gee,
I wonder if he's upset.

10:06.823 --> 10:08.738
I may know
what's going on.

10:08.912 --> 10:10.914
I didn't exactly respond
to his Bond movie

10:11.088 --> 10:12.873
- the way that he'd hoped.
- And how did you respond?

10:13.047 --> 10:14.352
I laughed and laughed.

10:14.526 --> 10:15.440
And then laughed
some more.

10:15.615 --> 10:16.964
Why would you do that?

10:17.138 --> 10:18.182
I thought
that it was a joke.

10:18.356 --> 10:20.271
He wrestled
a rubber snake.

10:20.445 --> 10:21.969
For nine minutes.

10:22.143 --> 10:23.971
For some reason,
he demanded final cut.

10:24.145 --> 10:26.147
Still, it's well established
Barry's a tad sensitive.

10:26.321 --> 10:27.627
A tad?

10:27.801 --> 10:29.237
I coughed
while he was talking,

10:29.411 --> 10:30.891
and he accused me of
trying to ruin his story

10:31.065 --> 10:32.066
about meeting a turtle.

10:32.240 --> 10:34.416
Insanely sensitive.

10:34.590 --> 10:36.287
But how could
he not be?

10:36.461 --> 10:39.160
On one hand,
our dad constantly
calls him a moron.

10:39.334 --> 10:40.944
On the other,
our mom endlessly

10:41.118 --> 10:43.207
showers him
with undeserved praise.

10:43.381 --> 10:44.861
It's not a parenting
success story.

10:45.035 --> 10:46.994
But he will
get over it, right?

10:47.168 --> 10:48.386
I don't know.
One time at the mall,

10:48.560 --> 10:50.214
he lost
a game of peek-a-boo
to a baby,

10:50.388 --> 10:51.738
and I had to
physically separate them.

10:51.912 --> 10:53.522
Sounds like
he can't really
handle anything.

10:53.696 --> 10:55.393
You're a quick study,
Joanne.

10:55.567 --> 10:56.656
But I can give you
a few tricks

10:56.830 --> 10:58.440
that I use to calm our
combustible little buddy.

10:58.614 --> 11:00.964
We'll begin with
the three P's.

11:01.138 --> 11:02.749
First up, praise.

11:02.923 --> 11:03.967
So I just say
nice things to him?

11:04.141 --> 11:05.621
- I do that already.
- No.

11:05.795 --> 11:08.580
This is the kind of praise
that isn't applicable
to any human.

11:08.755 --> 11:10.147
If it doesn't feel like
you're worshipping
a living god,

11:10.321 --> 11:11.758
you're doing it wrong.

11:11.932 --> 11:13.455
Stroke the bear.
Check.

11:13.629 --> 11:15.109
There's gotta be so many
better ways to say that.

11:15.283 --> 11:16.501
Next up, power.

11:16.676 --> 11:17.764
Of course.

11:17.938 --> 11:19.504
I have it all,
and he wants it.

11:19.679 --> 11:21.332
Not at all.

11:21.506 --> 11:23.465
Power as in athletic prowess
on the sports field.

11:23.639 --> 11:25.641
So just let him win
at sports?

11:25.815 --> 11:27.774
Well, it goes against
my dominant nature,
but okay.

11:27.948 --> 11:29.776
For the third
and final "P"...

11:29.950 --> 11:31.342
Pan-fried trout?
No, it's pan-fried chicken.

11:31.516 --> 11:32.996
Oh, wait, is the "P" silent?
Is it Pterodactyl?

11:33.170 --> 11:34.519
You don't have to guess.

11:34.694 --> 11:36.652
You just have to
publicly humiliate yourself.

11:36.826 --> 11:39.176
You lower yourself
to make him feel higher.

11:39.350 --> 11:41.439
For the record, I don't think
any woman should ever

11:41.613 --> 11:43.790
debase herself
to make a man feel better.

11:43.964 --> 11:45.487
Well, that's why
you don't have
a boyfriend.

11:47.358 --> 11:48.359
Thanks.

11:53.234 --> 11:54.801
She took
the chalkboard.

11:54.975 --> 11:57.455
While Joanne hoped <i>
to help Barry save face,</i>

11:57.629 --> 12:00.720
<i>my mom's plan</i> <i>
to fix Mike's marriage</i> <i>
had blown up in hers.</i>

12:00.894 --> 12:03.113
You will never guess
who I just saw during

12:03.287 --> 12:05.202
my power walk/power sit
and eat Sbarro at the mall.

12:05.376 --> 12:06.334
- Tip O'Neill?
- No.

12:06.508 --> 12:07.465
- Mr. Belvedere?
- TV character.

12:07.639 --> 12:08.728
- Quick Draw McGraw?
- Cartoon.

12:08.902 --> 12:11.121
- Waldenbooks?
- That is a store.

12:11.295 --> 12:13.689
It was Formica Mike
and Jane Bales.

12:13.863 --> 12:15.517
He was sitting
on her lap.

12:15.691 --> 12:17.040
I don't follow.

12:17.214 --> 12:18.607
And I'm not asking for
a clarification.

12:18.781 --> 12:20.348
I just refuse to follow.

12:20.522 --> 12:23.307
He needs to dump her
and go back to his wife.

12:23.481 --> 12:24.918
Have you ever thought
for a second

12:25.092 --> 12:27.137
that it's a good thing
that Mike and Fran split?

12:27.311 --> 12:29.096
Have you ever thought
for a second
that you don't know

12:29.270 --> 12:30.750
what the
you're talking about?

12:30.924 --> 12:32.621
Fran's...
A lot.

12:32.795 --> 12:34.797
Why?

12:34.971 --> 12:36.843
Because she's a strong,
confident woman
who speaks her mind?

12:37.017 --> 12:38.018
You've seen it, too.

12:41.151 --> 12:43.414
How dare you?

12:43.588 --> 12:44.720
How could you
take my Mikey

12:44.894 --> 12:46.330
and set him up
with another woman?

12:46.504 --> 12:48.550
I don't understand.
He said you kicked him out.

12:48.724 --> 12:51.074
Of course I did.
That's our thing.

12:51.248 --> 12:53.033
Especially now that
the kids are
out of the house

12:53.207 --> 12:54.861
and the seams
have been revealed.

12:55.035 --> 12:56.297
We're hot,
then we're cold,

12:56.471 --> 12:58.081
then we're sweaty
and disgusting.

12:58.255 --> 12:59.866
It's called marriage.

13:00.040 --> 13:02.259
I was just trying
to push him back to you.

13:02.433 --> 13:04.044
By dangling Bo Derek
in front of him?

13:04.218 --> 13:05.306
She's awful.

13:05.480 --> 13:07.047
Men don't care
about awful.

13:07.221 --> 13:08.526
I'm awful.

13:08.700 --> 13:09.919
You need to fix this.

13:10.093 --> 13:12.356
We may have hit a rut,
but he's my forever baby.

13:12.530 --> 13:15.882
There may be
a way for me
to undo all of this.

13:18.101 --> 13:20.930
We are gonna put you
on the arm
of a beautiful man.

13:21.104 --> 13:23.280
And make Mikey jealous,
nice.

13:23.454 --> 13:26.544
Say hello to physical
educationalist Coach Nick.

13:26.718 --> 13:28.155
A circus strong man?
I don't know.

13:28.329 --> 13:29.417
He's not really my type.

13:29.591 --> 13:31.375
Well, it's not
about your type.

13:31.549 --> 13:33.769
It's about who is gonna be
the most threatening to Mike.

13:33.943 --> 13:35.553
He does fill out
those tiny shorts.

13:35.727 --> 13:37.991
Those would be
full-blown pants
on a regular man.

13:39.819 --> 13:42.473
One glance at
Coach Nick's beefy arms

13:42.647 --> 13:44.127
will send Mike running
straight back into yours.

13:44.301 --> 13:46.173
I love this plan.

13:46.347 --> 13:48.871
As my mom was fixing up <i>
another unlikely couple,</i>

13:49.045 --> 13:52.222
<i>Joanne was trying to fix</i> <i>
her relationship with Barry,</i> <i>
starting with praise.</i>

13:52.396 --> 13:55.791
Hubba-hubba.
Look at my buff,
beautiful boy.

13:55.965 --> 13:57.488
Did someone
replace my shirt
with a snugger version?

13:57.662 --> 13:58.968
Pfft.
I wouldn't know,

13:59.142 --> 14:00.535
but you are
the smartest person
God made.

14:00.709 --> 14:02.929
Well, it doesn't matter
if I can't punch and kick.

14:03.103 --> 14:05.061
<i>But praise</i> <i>
didn't seem to work,</i>

14:05.235 --> 14:06.976
<i>so it was time for</i> <i>
the second "P"... Power.</i>

14:07.150 --> 14:09.370
Hey.

14:09.544 --> 14:10.980
Bet you can't
score on me.

14:11.154 --> 14:12.416
Effortless challenge
accepted.

14:12.590 --> 14:14.288
Great.

14:14.462 --> 14:15.898
Oh. Oh.

14:16.072 --> 14:18.118
Ah! Ah!

14:18.292 --> 14:20.381
Oh, boom shakalaka.

14:20.555 --> 14:23.688
You are clearly
an NBA All-Star.

14:23.863 --> 14:26.691
Wait. These aren't
regulation nets.

14:26.866 --> 14:29.129
There's a 9-year-old
over there windmill jamming.

14:29.303 --> 14:30.826
And he has newer Jordans
than mine.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.741
And when that didn't work,

14:32.915 --> 14:34.395
<i>Joanne had to resort</i> <i>
to the final "P"...</i>

14:34.569 --> 14:35.787
<i>Public humiliation.</i>

14:35.962 --> 14:36.788
Whoa!

14:38.660 --> 14:41.141
Well,
this is embarrassing.

14:41.315 --> 14:43.360
But also hilarious.

14:43.534 --> 14:45.362
Now you can laugh at me

14:45.536 --> 14:48.061
and recognize that sometimes
things in life are funny.

14:48.235 --> 14:50.541
I don't see why it's funny to
waste all that Hawaiian Punch.

14:50.715 --> 14:51.891
Island people worked hard

14:52.065 --> 14:53.849
to squeeze tropical sunshine
into every drop.

14:54.023 --> 14:55.546
Seriously, Barry?
Come on.

14:55.720 --> 14:57.548
You come on.

14:57.722 --> 14:59.550
Why did you laugh at me
as James Bond?

14:59.724 --> 15:01.465
Because it was hysterical.

15:01.639 --> 15:03.685
But I was equal parts
dangerous and sexy.

15:03.859 --> 15:05.905
You weren't, okay?

15:06.079 --> 15:08.124
I love you so much
that I bent over backwards

15:08.298 --> 15:09.212
to make you feel better.

15:09.386 --> 15:11.780
So maybe the problem
isn't that I laughed

15:11.954 --> 15:14.174
but that you're too insecure
to laugh at yourself.

15:14.348 --> 15:16.002
Ugh.

15:18.134 --> 15:20.441
While Joanne had hit
her breaking point with Barry,

15:20.615 --> 15:22.747
<i>my mom was still hoping</i> <i>
she could get Mike and Fran</i>

15:22.922 --> 15:24.227
<i>to come together.</i>

15:24.401 --> 15:26.099
Beverly,
this puff is heavenly.

15:26.273 --> 15:27.622
What's in it?

15:27.796 --> 15:31.060
Oh, just butter,
lard, oil, flour,

15:31.234 --> 15:33.933
cheese, bacon, more cheese,
and beef drippin's.

15:34.107 --> 15:35.543
Beef drippin's?

15:35.717 --> 15:37.632
That's what Mama used
to feed me as a baby.

15:37.806 --> 15:39.242
Aww.

15:39.416 --> 15:41.592
It's dark out,
there are people in my house,

15:41.766 --> 15:43.464
and I don't like it.

15:43.638 --> 15:45.945
It's called a mingle party,
Murray. So mingle.

15:46.119 --> 15:47.555
And do I really
need to be here

15:47.729 --> 15:49.513
for your little lesson on
the sanctity of marriage?

15:49.687 --> 15:53.256
Yes. You're gonna
witness firsthand
how love always wins.

15:53.430 --> 15:54.866
Can love win in the basement
with the TV on?

15:56.433 --> 15:58.087
Bev, we need to talk.

15:58.261 --> 16:00.611
Look, I know giant Coach Nick
is not your type

16:00.785 --> 16:02.918
and shorts with a blazer
are not <i>au courant,</i>

16:03.092 --> 16:04.485
but you got to trust me.

16:04.659 --> 16:06.574
Mike is gonna come
crawling back in no time.

16:06.748 --> 16:08.968
Forget dumb Mike.
I think it's love
with this Nick fella.

16:09.142 --> 16:10.752
He wants
to take me places.

16:10.926 --> 16:12.493
It's to run stairs
at the stadium,

16:12.667 --> 16:15.278
but he's so intense
and demanding,

16:15.452 --> 16:16.845
I think I want
to please him.

16:17.019 --> 16:20.283
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

16:20.457 --> 16:21.719
Hey, tell me
you're planning on
fighting Coach Nick

16:21.893 --> 16:22.982
to get your wife back.

16:23.156 --> 16:25.158
Why would I do that?

16:25.332 --> 16:27.377
Look at that guy.
He's a brick wall with eyes.

16:27.551 --> 16:29.249
And I'll tell you something,
I'm relieved.

16:29.423 --> 16:30.902
Because for a minute there,
I felt bad

16:31.077 --> 16:32.992
about liking this horrible,
gorgeous woman.

16:33.166 --> 16:35.298
Oh, I made him
sell his dog.

16:35.472 --> 16:38.301
In fact, I would like
to propose a toast.

16:38.475 --> 16:40.086
To Beverly.

16:40.260 --> 16:42.305
She saw our broken home
and easily found it new love.

16:42.479 --> 16:43.785
Mm.

16:43.959 --> 16:45.569
Marriage is like
musical chairs.

16:45.743 --> 16:48.964
They play the music until
you find the right chair.

16:49.138 --> 16:51.401
And Jane is my chair.

16:51.575 --> 16:53.403
Oh, we'll see
who's gonna be whose chair.

16:53.577 --> 16:56.102
Well, I'm happy
for all of you.

17:00.541 --> 17:02.456
Hey, what's going on?

17:02.630 --> 17:04.632
Honestly,
I don't know.

17:04.806 --> 17:07.069
I thought marriage was
supposed to last forever.

17:07.243 --> 17:08.897
Aw, come on.

17:10.942 --> 17:12.074
Erica knows
better than that.

17:12.248 --> 17:13.728
I'm not worried
about Erica.

17:13.902 --> 17:15.295
I'm worried about us.

17:15.469 --> 17:16.470
Us?

17:16.644 --> 17:18.776
Mike's lazy, Fran nags.

17:18.950 --> 17:21.605
She speaks her mind,
he's a pill.

17:21.779 --> 17:24.173
Their kids go off to college,
and immediately
they grow apart.

17:24.347 --> 17:26.262
I mean,
I know it sounds crazy,

17:26.436 --> 17:27.785
but are we
that different?

17:27.959 --> 17:29.613
Bevy,
that's ridiculous.

17:29.787 --> 17:31.267
Is it?

17:31.441 --> 17:33.617
They thought the same thing
once, too.

17:40.146 --> 17:42.148
After his most recent <i>
interaction with Joanne,</i>

17:42.322 --> 17:44.106
<i>Barry was left with</i> <i>
a burning question.</i>

17:44.280 --> 17:45.803
JTP and Adam.

17:45.977 --> 17:48.197
JTP!
- And Adam, I guess.

17:48.371 --> 17:50.417
Joanne has
brought something
to my attention

17:50.591 --> 17:52.288
that has shaken me
to my rock-hard core.

17:52.462 --> 17:53.724
Be honest.

17:53.898 --> 17:54.682
Would you describe me
as sensitive?

17:56.858 --> 17:58.599
I would describe you
as handsome and powerful.

17:58.773 --> 18:00.079
Yeah.
Wanna tackle me?

18:00.253 --> 18:01.950
Tackle me, too,
Big Tasty.

18:02.124 --> 18:03.082
Always down for
a Barry tackle.

18:03.256 --> 18:04.648
Damn it, it's true.

18:04.822 --> 18:05.867
You're all just
triple "P"-ing me.

18:06.041 --> 18:07.390
I saw the chalkboard.

18:07.564 --> 18:08.913
Aw, why did Joanne
take it with her?

18:09.088 --> 18:11.351
My closest friends
and family

18:11.525 --> 18:13.222
don't even feel comfortable
being honest with me?

18:13.396 --> 18:16.051
Bar, it's just...
You feel so deeply.

18:16.225 --> 18:19.054
Plus, you're unstable,
irrational, volatile,

18:19.228 --> 18:20.186
and oh, no,
what have I done?

18:20.360 --> 18:22.666
See, we live in
constant fear

18:22.840 --> 18:25.278
of how you'll react to
even the smallest criticism.

18:25.452 --> 18:27.062
You're actually ripping up
my history paper as we speak.

18:27.236 --> 18:29.891
Fine. I can be
a bit brash at times,

18:30.065 --> 18:31.110
and you've all just been
okay with this?

18:31.284 --> 18:33.112
It's been a difficult
two decades.

18:33.286 --> 18:34.504
I have something called
trauma dandruff.

18:34.678 --> 18:36.854
But we care about you
and want to protect you.

18:37.028 --> 18:39.292
Even though sometimes
it's at our own expense.

18:39.466 --> 18:41.250
We aren't honest with you
because it's easier.

18:41.424 --> 18:44.210
But what Joanne did,
telling you the truth,

18:44.384 --> 18:46.951
laughing in the face
of a wild-card lunatic,

18:47.126 --> 18:48.605
that took guts.

18:48.779 --> 18:49.998
Okay.

18:50.172 --> 18:51.869
But from now on,
I'd rather have

18:52.043 --> 18:53.610
a little dose of honesty
from you guys, too.

18:53.784 --> 18:55.090
- Nope.
- Our system works.

18:55.264 --> 18:56.874
- If it ain't broke.
- I'm going to college soon.

18:59.138 --> 19:00.617
Hey.

19:00.791 --> 19:02.271
I was hoping
you'd be here.

19:02.445 --> 19:04.708
It really didn't seem that way
the past few days.

19:04.882 --> 19:07.624
Sorry. I was jealous
of your relationship
with James Bond.

19:07.798 --> 19:10.758
A fictional character,
but go on.

19:10.932 --> 19:14.675
It also seems
I'm deeply insecure.

19:14.849 --> 19:16.590
And even though
it hurts,

19:16.764 --> 19:18.635
the good thing is
I know you'll always
tell me the truth.

19:18.809 --> 19:20.376
Always.

19:20.550 --> 19:22.726
Like if it was between
you and 007,

19:22.900 --> 19:24.467
I'd pick you every time.

19:24.641 --> 19:27.557
- Really?
- Really.

19:27.731 --> 19:29.646
Why, Mr. Goldberg,

19:29.820 --> 19:30.865
can I fix you something?

19:31.039 --> 19:32.780
Coffee, tea, me?

19:34.651 --> 19:35.739
Get over here.

19:39.830 --> 19:41.005
Well, I just
finished my vows.

19:41.180 --> 19:42.485
Want to take a look?

19:42.659 --> 19:44.270
Did you mention
that marriage is

19:44.444 --> 19:46.185
nothing but a silly farce
until you die?

19:46.837 --> 19:48.230
Just read.

19:50.928 --> 19:52.930
"I can't wait to be
your partner for life,

19:53.104 --> 19:54.932
"your best friend,

19:55.106 --> 19:57.239
"the person
you grow old with.

19:57.413 --> 20:00.416
"Some people say
marriage is hard,

20:00.590 --> 20:03.593
"but I know it won't be for me
because I'll be
married to you."

20:05.421 --> 20:07.336
Erica,
this is so beautiful.

20:09.295 --> 20:10.861
It's because
Dad helped me.

20:14.343 --> 20:15.953
You helped her
with this?

20:16.127 --> 20:18.913
Eh, the girl transcribed
some grunts.

20:19.087 --> 20:20.871
So you're never
gonna leave me?

20:21.045 --> 20:22.830
Bevy, we're not like
those other people.

20:24.875 --> 20:28.488
You are my everything.

20:28.662 --> 20:29.402
Just don't make a big deal
out of it.

20:33.232 --> 20:34.798
I'm your everything!

20:38.976 --> 20:40.151
Sometimes love <i>
isn't perfect.</i>

20:43.677 --> 20:45.374
<i>When you're with</i> <i>
the right person,</i>

20:45.548 --> 20:47.855
<i>you learn to love them</i> <i>
not despite their flaws,</i>

20:48.029 --> 20:48.899
<i>but because of them.</i>

20:56.037 --> 20:57.865
Okay, despite
my better judgment,
we're doing a sequel.

20:58.039 --> 20:59.388
All right,
where's my Bond girl?

20:59.562 --> 21:01.912
She's sitting this one out
for obvious reasons.

21:02.086 --> 21:03.566
But I did find you
a new Bond girl

21:03.740 --> 21:05.089
that I think you'll have
a real connection with.

21:05.264 --> 21:06.613
What? Who?

21:09.746 --> 21:12.401
Why, Mr. Bond, you look
surprised to see me.

21:12.575 --> 21:15.230
Introducing Mommy Galore.

21:15.404 --> 21:17.058
I'm a moon scientist.

21:17.232 --> 21:19.974
No. I am not gonna wrestle on
the rim of a volcano with her.

21:20.148 --> 21:21.497
But I have
a license to snuggy.

21:23.107 --> 21:24.587
Here she goes.

21:24.761 --> 21:26.154
- Ugh.
- He loves them.

21:26.328 --> 21:27.677
She really is the greatest
villain of all time.

21:27.851 --> 21:29.157
- Stop, stop. Cut.
- Fine!
