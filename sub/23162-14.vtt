WEBVTT

00:00.017 --> 00:03.043
I'm leaving.
I won't be coming back ever.

00:05.223 --> 00:07.919
Just because a guy takes a job,
he has to be as difficult as Higgins?

00:07.992 --> 00:10.426
I think I can do the job.
With a little help.

00:10.494 --> 00:13.622
Magnum. Zeus, Apollo,
Miss Malcolm, stay!

00:13.698 --> 00:16.326
I have given up everything
to be here.

00:16.400 --> 00:19.631
We all have a great deal to do
before we move out tomorrow.

00:20.872 --> 00:21.930
Hip hip hooray!

00:22.106 --> 00:24.040
Then we'll have to shoot him.

01:55.034 --> 01:57.229
Detail. Stand ready.

02:08.314 --> 02:11.112
Present arms!

03:06.705 --> 03:08.332
Cease fire!

03:14.046 --> 03:15.775
Perimeter secure, sir.

03:15.848 --> 03:17.543
Communications secure, sir.

03:17.616 --> 03:20.346
Control tent
secure, sir.

03:35.534 --> 03:37.764
Sorry we were late for the invasion,
Mr. Prime Minister.

03:37.837 --> 03:39.805
But we had
to make a pickup.

03:39.905 --> 03:42.100
More gifts
from the Chancellor.

03:42.174 --> 03:43.573
When's he joining us?

03:43.642 --> 03:45.405
Noon, tomorrow.

03:46.378 --> 03:48.812
I guess the test went
pretty well, huh?

03:49.648 --> 03:51.673
The maneuvers, Dan, please.

03:51.750 --> 03:53.775
If you're going to become an
officer in our new government,

03:53.853 --> 03:57.949
the least you can do is try to
develop a military vocabulary, hmm?

04:00.759 --> 04:03.250
Most commendable, gentlemen.

04:03.529 --> 04:05.588
Yes, you're ready.

04:06.832 --> 04:11.098
We set sail for the Dothan
lslands at 0900 hours in two days.

04:12.838 --> 04:14.465
Dismissed.

04:20.411 --> 04:23.313
Hip hip hooray!
Hip hip hooray!

04:47.072 --> 04:50.530
Sometimes I think maybe
I've spent too long in Paradise.

04:50.609 --> 04:53.806
I sort of take it
for granted. Like pizza.

04:54.246 --> 04:56.840
I mean, while I find a lot of
security in the knowledge

04:56.916 --> 04:59.407
that Paradise and pizza
are always there.

04:59.485 --> 05:01.919
It's awfully easy
to get complacent.

05:01.987 --> 05:06.014
Pepperoni or sausage?
A perfect sunrise or a perfect rainbow?

05:06.091 --> 05:09.424
Why not just have
all of the above again today?

05:09.495 --> 05:12.692
Now, I can deprive myself of pizza
for a week and appreciate it again.

05:12.765 --> 05:14.858
But Paradise?

05:14.934 --> 05:16.959
It's always at my door

05:17.036 --> 05:19.129
and while it can be
very pleasant,

05:19.204 --> 05:22.139
it can also be
very predictable.

05:24.243 --> 05:25.642
Magnum?

05:28.380 --> 05:30.507
Magnum, please.
I must speak to you.

05:30.583 --> 05:32.710
No! I'm sleeping!

05:34.720 --> 05:35.982
I promise to be brief.

05:36.055 --> 05:39.718
Higgins, out!
I was up all night on a case.

05:39.792 --> 05:43.193
Yes, I know. I'm truly sorry
to wake you,

05:43.262 --> 05:46.925
but there are certain duties you
must perform for Mr. Masters.

05:46.999 --> 05:50.059
No! Whatever it is,
it can wait till this afternoon.

05:50.135 --> 05:54.071
I'm afraid not. You see,
they're my duties, and I'm leaving.

05:54.707 --> 05:57.335
Leaving? You didn't say
anything about going anywhere.

05:57.409 --> 05:59.604
When will you be back?

05:59.678 --> 06:01.737
I won't be coming back.

06:03.215 --> 06:05.012
Today, you mean?

06:05.784 --> 06:08.082
I won't be coming back ever.

06:16.328 --> 06:18.193
Higgins, let me
brush my teeth...

06:18.263 --> 06:20.561
There isn't time.
I have a taxi waiting.

06:20.633 --> 06:23.466
My flight to London
departs in one hour.

06:23.602 --> 06:25.729
England? Higgins...

06:25.804 --> 06:28.739
Per Robin Masters, you are to
oversee the operation of the Estate

06:28.807 --> 06:31.867
until my replacement arrives
this afternoon.

06:33.612 --> 06:35.580
You're serious?
Yes.

06:36.482 --> 06:39.918
I apologize for waiting until the
last possible moment to inform you,

06:39.985 --> 06:41.953
but I thought it best.

06:42.755 --> 06:46.156
Just like that? You're gone?
This doesn't make sense.

06:46.225 --> 06:49.353
Unfortunately it wasn't
"just like that."

06:49.428 --> 06:52.090
It has been imminent
for some time.

06:52.164 --> 06:55.691
I do have one rather
personal favor to ask,

06:56.168 --> 06:58.602
and that is that you
care for the lads

06:58.671 --> 07:02.198
until my replacement develops
a rapport with them.

07:02.274 --> 07:06.301
Granted, your relationship with Zeus and
Apollo has not been altogether cordial,

07:06.378 --> 07:09.279
but they do know you
and accept you.

07:11.750 --> 07:13.911
Now, now, none of that.

07:14.586 --> 07:17.180
Courage, lads. Courage.

07:20.459 --> 07:22.359
Goodbye, Magnum.

07:23.095 --> 07:24.824
Higgins?

07:25.597 --> 07:27.087
Higgins, wait!

07:33.839 --> 07:36.103
No, please.

07:37.209 --> 07:39.700
I'll carry that with me.
Thank you.

07:42.648 --> 07:45.116
Higgins?
Higgins, wait.

07:46.752 --> 07:48.379
Higgins!

07:49.722 --> 07:53.920
Higgins, you don't leave until
you tell me what's going on.

07:55.194 --> 07:57.662
I've been dismissed
from my post.

07:59.832 --> 08:01.493
Fired?

08:02.101 --> 08:04.365
Robin actually let you go?

08:04.703 --> 08:06.136
Why?

08:12.678 --> 08:15.647
It would never
survive the trip to England.

08:16.315 --> 08:18.545
Please take it as a gift.

08:23.422 --> 08:26.289
But I don't have anything
to give you.

08:26.925 --> 08:29.086
You have been my friend.

09:02.528 --> 09:04.393
I still can't believe it.

09:04.463 --> 09:07.990
Yeah. It does feel
a little strange around here.

09:08.066 --> 09:10.591
Come on, guys,
snap out of it!

09:10.669 --> 09:13.001
Here we go, come on.
Here we go.

09:18.744 --> 09:22.373
Come on, guys, you always
chase me when I run.

09:27.085 --> 09:31.112
Hey, Thomas, leave 'em alone.
Can't you see they're depressed?

09:31.190 --> 09:34.421
They know that Higgins left this morning
for good and they want to know why.

09:34.493 --> 09:37.291
Well, so do l. But I can't
find out until Robin calls me.

09:37.362 --> 09:40.422
In the meantime, Higgins left the
lads in my care. Come on, guys!

09:40.499 --> 09:42.057
Here we go!

09:42.134 --> 09:45.365
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, the new
major-domo will be here soon.

09:45.437 --> 09:47.530
Why don't you let him
worry about shaping them up?

09:47.606 --> 09:50.234
Better hope that
he doesn't shape Thomas up.

09:50.309 --> 09:53.767
Or there won't be any more tennis
trade outs, and no more wine deals.

09:53.846 --> 09:56.144
Hey, what if the guy
is a Ferrari freak?

09:56.215 --> 09:58.649
Hey,
no more wheels.

09:58.717 --> 10:01.345
You know,
you better face it, pally,

10:01.420 --> 10:03.285
you could be in big trouble.

10:03.355 --> 10:05.289
Hey, come on, I mean...

10:05.624 --> 10:08.525
Give the guy a chance.
We haven't even met him yet.

10:08.594 --> 10:11.119
He might be nice,
easy-going...

10:11.196 --> 10:15.030
I mean, is there any law
that says that

10:15.100 --> 10:18.160
just because a guy takes a job,
he has to be as difficult as Higgins?

10:18.237 --> 10:20.967
Hey, don't knock him just because he
gave you a hard time now and then.

10:21.039 --> 10:22.666
Now and then?

10:22.741 --> 10:25.005
I mean, what am l
really saying goodbye to?

10:25.110 --> 10:28.238
I'm saying goodbye to constant
complaints, constant arguments,

10:28.313 --> 10:32.545
put-downs, threats, early wake-ups,
long boring stories.

10:32.918 --> 10:37.855
And always, always somebody coming
into my house without knocking!

10:39.524 --> 10:40.582
So let's look
on the bright side.

10:40.659 --> 10:43.150
I mean, whatever this guy is,
he's not another Higgins.

10:49.968 --> 10:52.368
I think I could talk Robin into
giving Higgins his job back.

10:54.273 --> 10:55.501
Really?

10:55.574 --> 10:58.600
Yeah, if I can reach him. I mean,
I've left messages everywhere,

10:58.677 --> 11:02.579
but I just can't figure out
why he won't return my calls.

11:02.648 --> 11:05.208
Maybe he just doesn't want
to talk about it.

11:05.284 --> 11:08.583
I mean, why didn't he
or Higgins give you a clue

11:08.654 --> 11:11.122
Iong before
the problem got out of hand?

11:11.189 --> 11:15.717
I guess he didn't tell anybody but them.
And he knew that they couldn't blab.

11:17.763 --> 11:22.132
Hey, could one of you guys kind of
hang around here for a couple of hours?

11:22.868 --> 11:24.335
Oh, I gotta go to Maui.

11:24.403 --> 11:26.132
And I ain't doing
no dog-sitting.

11:26.204 --> 11:27.398
Rick, Rick, Rick.
Come on.

11:27.472 --> 11:29.099
Higgins' replacement
will be here any time.

11:29.174 --> 11:31.301
I just need
to talk to somebody.

11:31.376 --> 11:32.604
Who?

11:33.245 --> 11:37.545
Who else besides the lads loves
to listen to Higgins' problems?

11:38.517 --> 11:42.476
He never said a word to me,
Mr. Magnum. Not a word.

11:43.121 --> 11:46.989
In fact, we were to attend the
symphony gala tomorrow evening.

11:47.059 --> 11:49.653
Wagner Under the Stars.

11:49.728 --> 11:51.719
I'd bought a new gown.

11:51.797 --> 11:54.766
And Jonathan had
already sent me a corsage.

11:55.567 --> 11:59.094
I'm sorry, Agatha, to be
the one who has to tell you.

11:59.237 --> 12:01.102
I kind of thought you'd
already know about it.

12:01.173 --> 12:03.971
No.
How could this happen?

12:05.043 --> 12:09.070
Jonathan dismissed after
all his years of service?

12:10.082 --> 12:14.314
And how could he leave
without so much as a goodbye?

12:14.386 --> 12:18.152
All I could get out of him is
that it's some kind of problem

12:18.223 --> 12:21.420
with Robin that's been
building up for a while.

12:21.493 --> 12:23.358
The objets d'art?

12:23.729 --> 12:25.458
No, surely not.

12:25.530 --> 12:29.523
Mr. Masters knows how distressed
Jonathan's been about them.

12:29.601 --> 12:30.932
Objets d'art?

12:31.003 --> 12:33.301
It's French
for "objects of art."

12:33.372 --> 12:37.934
I know what it means, Agatha,
but what objects are you talking about?

12:38.010 --> 12:39.136
Some of Robin's?

12:39.211 --> 12:42.112
Yes.
Several expensive ones.

12:43.982 --> 12:46.382
I don't understand.

12:46.451 --> 12:48.885
I thought you were
conducting an investigation.

12:48.954 --> 12:51.081
Investigation of what?

12:53.191 --> 12:57.127
Oh. All this will make
more sense after some tea.

12:58.130 --> 13:00.223
Excuse me.

13:03.001 --> 13:04.434
Hello?

13:04.503 --> 13:06.801
Yes, Mr. Wright,
one moment.

13:08.006 --> 13:12.272
For you, Mr. Magnum. Something to
do with Jonathan's replacement.

13:12.944 --> 13:15.071
Rick, has he arrived?
He?

13:16.448 --> 13:19.645
The fact that I'm a woman
is not the problem.

13:19.785 --> 13:24.245
The problem is that I'm an
actress and not a resort manager.

13:25.857 --> 13:29.293
Why did Robin hire you for the job then,
Miss Malcolm?

13:30.295 --> 13:32.388
I think it came up once
in conversation

13:32.464 --> 13:35.991
that I'd had a three hour
course in hotel management.

13:36.735 --> 13:39.568
I don't think it came up
that I flunked it.

13:39.871 --> 13:41.031
What am I going to do?

13:41.106 --> 13:42.835
Well, you're...
You're going to relax.

13:42.908 --> 13:46.105
And when I reach Robin, I'll straighten
things out, and then you can leave.

13:46.178 --> 13:50.046
Leave? Oh, no, no.
I can't leave. I need the money.

13:50.816 --> 13:54.411
Well, it's just a
small stipend, but I need it.

13:55.353 --> 13:58.447
And I think I can do the job.
I know I can.

13:59.291 --> 14:01.020
With a little help.

14:01.093 --> 14:03.823
You can fill me in
in no time. I'm very quick.

14:03.895 --> 14:05.055
And I'm very busy.

14:05.130 --> 14:08.156
I mean, there's some very expensive
items missing from the Estate,

14:08.233 --> 14:10.292
and it's my job to find them.

14:10.368 --> 14:12.836
But it's also your job
to help me.

14:18.210 --> 14:20.940
Robin, why haven't you
returned my calls?

14:21.012 --> 14:23.674
Why isn't Ginny answering
the phone, Thomas?

14:23.748 --> 14:25.807
She hasn't arrived yet?

14:25.884 --> 14:30.014
Uh, yeah. Yes, she's here,
but I had some questions...

14:30.088 --> 14:33.080
Not about Higgins.
The subject is closed.

14:33.658 --> 14:35.717
Now, I expect
your full cooperation

14:35.794 --> 14:39.025
in orienting Ginny
to her Estate duties.

14:39.097 --> 14:41.861
She'll be there until I can
get a permanent replacement

14:41.933 --> 14:44.595
or get Ian MacKerras in
from London.

14:45.137 --> 14:48.038
Well, that's what
I wanted to talk to you about.

14:48.206 --> 14:49.366
Hello? Robin?

14:49.441 --> 14:52.103
Look, I really feel like
I'm entitled to a little help

14:52.177 --> 14:53.769
until I get the hang
of this thing.

14:53.845 --> 14:56.905
But Mr. Magnum says he has to look
for all this stuff that's missing.

14:56.982 --> 14:58.711
Now, if that's the way
you want it...

14:58.783 --> 15:00.683
What missing stuff?

15:00.752 --> 15:02.982
Robin...
What missing stuff?

15:07.092 --> 15:11.893
Well, there are some art
objects that have disappeared,

15:11.963 --> 15:14.090
but I'm sure Higgins
meant to tell me about 'em.

15:14.166 --> 15:16.225
I doubt that seriously.

15:16.902 --> 15:18.665
Well, what does that mean?

15:18.737 --> 15:22.798
I mean, can you tell me what's going on
here? I think I deserve an explanation.

15:22.874 --> 15:23.898
Very well.

15:23.975 --> 15:25.067
When Higgins refused

15:25.143 --> 15:29.409
to explain a recent disappearance
of $50,000 from the Estate account,

15:29.481 --> 15:31.540
he was politely dismissed.

15:31.616 --> 15:34.244
But now that he's been
unmasked as a common thief,

15:34.319 --> 15:36.981
he will have
to be dealt with my way.

15:37.055 --> 15:39.922
You, Thomas, will forget
the entire incident.

15:39.991 --> 15:42.516
And you will forget Higgins.

15:47.731 --> 15:50.928
The sunrise was
perfect and right on schedule.

15:51.001 --> 15:54.528
The rainbows started showing up,
as usual, within an hour.

15:54.605 --> 15:58.041
The pizza arrived cold,
and my bottle tops wouldn't twist off.

15:58.108 --> 16:01.009
But despite all that
comfortable predictability,

16:01.078 --> 16:03.740
Paradise was suddenly
very different.

16:03.814 --> 16:06.874
There was an eerie quiet
all over the Estate.

16:06.951 --> 16:09.215
Then there were
my two improbable roommates

16:09.286 --> 16:12.983
who were now very reluctant
to let me out of their sight.

16:13.057 --> 16:15.992
And then there was a situation
that nobody could have predicted.

16:16.060 --> 16:19.120
Higgins dismissed
and accused of grand larceny.

16:19.196 --> 16:20.595
The evidence was
stacked against him

16:20.664 --> 16:24.293
and I began to wonder
how it got stacked so neatly.

16:24.368 --> 16:27.633
I also began to wonder why Higgins
left no forwarding address,

16:27.705 --> 16:30.640
which led me to wondering how
I'd ever pay my phone bill.

16:30.708 --> 16:32.699
Operator.
Hi.

16:32.776 --> 16:36.234
Am I still on the night rate
for calling England?

16:37.681 --> 16:40.149
T.C.: You tried
calling every hotel in London?

16:40.217 --> 16:41.616
Well, every one
I could think of

16:41.685 --> 16:44.916
in between feeding the lads and
running interference for Ginny Malcolm.

16:44.989 --> 16:47.856
Oh, yeah. Rick said she was
a little insecure. A little?

16:47.925 --> 16:51.156
She hasn't let me out of her sight
for 20 minutes since she got here.

16:51.228 --> 16:54.322
She never stops talking. She doesn't
know the first thing about security.

16:54.398 --> 16:57.959
I had to leave your phone number with
her just to get out of the house.

16:58.035 --> 17:00.936
I mean, every time I turn around,
she's under my feet.

17:01.005 --> 17:02.370
Yeah, well, I'm sure
it won't be long

17:02.439 --> 17:05.875
before you find Higgie-baby and
the universe is restored to normal.

17:05.943 --> 17:07.705
I hope you're right.

17:13.150 --> 17:16.642
Any luck?
Thomas, all of Robin's statues are gone.

17:16.720 --> 17:18.711
They were sold to some fence
on Market Street.

17:18.789 --> 17:21.952
They paid over $200,000
for that stuff.

17:22.026 --> 17:25.723
You gotta be kidding me. What would
Higgie need with that kind of money?

17:25.796 --> 17:27.286
They say
who brought them in?

17:27.364 --> 17:29.992
Uh, a guy named Dan. Tall, kind
of young. That's all I could get.

17:31.168 --> 17:33.864
Any last name? No.
But there is something else.

17:33.937 --> 17:35.700
The accountant at the Club
called me this morning.

17:35.773 --> 17:39.903
Higgins withdrew $10,000 from the
special projects fund. There's no reason.

17:42.880 --> 17:44.939
T.C.: Yo, Thomas.

17:45.015 --> 17:46.277
Yeah?

17:47.217 --> 17:48.775
Ginny Malcolm.

17:48.852 --> 17:50.581
Oh, for...
Tell her I'll call her back.

17:50.654 --> 17:55.057
Uh, no, I think you'd better talk to
her. Sounds like a real emergency.

18:15.579 --> 18:18.946
Hello, Mr. Magnum.
Thanks for getting here so fast.

18:19.383 --> 18:22.284
We're all locked in.
My key won't open the gate.

18:22.353 --> 18:24.913
Do you know
how to stop all this?

18:24.988 --> 18:27.513
Oh, some sort of
override code, huh?

18:27.591 --> 18:31.357
I have no idea what happened.
I was just trying to use the computer.

18:31.895 --> 18:35.661
Do you think that I did something
to set off the alarm system?

18:35.733 --> 18:38.065
Are you going to answer me?

18:39.136 --> 18:40.660
Look, I'm very sorry
about this,

18:40.738 --> 18:43.036
but I was just trying
to do my job.

18:43.107 --> 18:45.166
Without any help!

18:49.847 --> 18:52.907
How much is this stipend Robin's
paying you, Miss Malcolm?

18:52.983 --> 18:56.111
I don't have much money,
but I might try to better the offer

18:56.186 --> 18:57.983
if you promise to go away.

18:59.523 --> 19:03.152
This was not my fault. If you had
been around here like I asked you...

19:03.227 --> 19:04.717
You're not leaving again?
Are you staying?

19:04.795 --> 19:07.559
Of course I'm staying.
Then I'm leaving.

19:09.433 --> 19:11.196
In Robin's car?

19:12.803 --> 19:15.067
Now, I don't want to have to
take your car keys, Mr. Magnum.

19:15.139 --> 19:17.164
I just want to take
a little of your time.

19:17.241 --> 19:21.177
But if I have to,
I'll call Robin and I'll take both.

19:23.046 --> 19:27.039
You don't need help. You're
catching on to the job real quick.

19:27.117 --> 19:30.280
I'm serious. I'll call him.
You're leaving?

19:31.722 --> 19:33.314
I'm staying.

19:33.824 --> 19:36.588
What were you using the
computer for in the first place?

19:36.660 --> 19:40.027
I was looking for a wine inventory.
Do you know how to punch it up?

19:40.097 --> 19:43.066
No, that only exists
in Higgins' head.

19:43.133 --> 19:47.399
But I do know the code for all the
employment records for the last five years.

19:47.471 --> 19:48.995
Oh, that's just great.

19:49.072 --> 19:52.974
And how's that going to help me find
my bottle of Chateau Lafite, 1938?

19:53.043 --> 19:54.305
It won't.

19:54.378 --> 19:58.314
Now, look, Robin wants me to serve that
to guests tonight, and I'm not going to...

19:58.382 --> 19:59.508
What's that?

19:59.583 --> 20:01.608
It's old employment records.
I'm looking for some information

20:01.685 --> 20:04.381
on a tall guy
who used to work here.

20:04.455 --> 20:06.082
Dan Davis?

20:06.156 --> 20:07.555
Maybe.

20:09.159 --> 20:12.686
Well, he can wait. Right now I'd like
the tall guy who's here to help me

20:12.763 --> 20:16.130
with menu plans and room
arrangements and a certain bottle

20:16.200 --> 20:17.963
of very expensive wine.

20:18.035 --> 20:20.401
Just as soon as I come back.

20:20.838 --> 20:23.602
In the meantime, if you talk to Robin,
tell him I said hello.

20:23.674 --> 20:25.335
Wait a minute. Magnum.

20:25.409 --> 20:27.900
Zeus, Apollo,
Miss Malcolm, stay!

20:33.951 --> 20:36.784
You want to plant
that many in a row?

20:37.654 --> 20:40.919
It's not a good idea,
Mr. Magnum. It drains the soil.

20:41.191 --> 20:44.991
Fine, Dan. You just tell me how many
I need, and I'll have Kenji plant 'em.

20:45.062 --> 20:46.689
You say Higgins got fired?

20:46.763 --> 20:48.560
Yeah. Hard to believe, huh?

20:48.632 --> 20:50.532
How many did you say
I needed?

20:50.601 --> 20:53.798
What? Oh, plants.
I think about two.

20:53.937 --> 20:54.926
Ah.

20:55.005 --> 20:58.839
If you don't mind,
what was Higgins given the sack for?

20:58.909 --> 21:00.900
Oh, money misunderstanding,

21:00.978 --> 21:04.311
and there were some things
missing at the Estate.

21:04.381 --> 21:06.144
You're kidding. Mr. Higgins?

21:06.216 --> 21:10.585
Well, you and I both know that Higgins
couldn't do anything like that.

21:10.654 --> 21:12.849
But I'm going to have to come
up with proof of his innocence

21:12.923 --> 21:15.221
if I'm gonna make
anybody else believe that.

21:15.292 --> 21:17.226
You think you can do it?
Oh, I'm getting there.

21:17.294 --> 21:19.956
I found out where
the stolen goods were sold.

21:20.030 --> 21:21.725
But I don't think
Higgins was the seller.

21:21.798 --> 21:25.495
I mean, would you describe
Higgins as tall and young?

21:26.937 --> 21:29.235
But I mean,
who could believe a fence?

21:29.306 --> 21:33.037
I mean, he probably just gave me
a fake name just to get rid of me.

21:33.110 --> 21:36.102
Yeah. Oh, he gave you
a name, too, huh?

21:36.480 --> 21:39.278
Yeah. Well, first name.
Dan.

21:40.284 --> 21:41.911
Will this be enough?

21:41.985 --> 21:43.850
Yeah, sure.
Look, I'll go ring it up.

21:43.921 --> 21:45.752
I'll go with you, Dan.

21:45.822 --> 21:49.553
Oh, no, no. You just wait right
here and I'll be right back.

22:11.848 --> 22:14.715
You weren't just going
to just run off, were you?

22:14.785 --> 22:18.414
'Cause there's a couple of
questions I need to ask you, Dan.

22:22.492 --> 22:23.789
Magnum.

22:23.860 --> 22:25.521
Ginny, not now.

22:26.997 --> 22:28.726
Let him go, Magnum.

22:42.112 --> 22:44.410
Just trying to do your job?

22:44.481 --> 22:46.642
Give me your car keys.
What?

22:46.717 --> 22:50.517
The keys, Magnum, now.
Before things get messed up any more.

23:20.350 --> 23:23.945
I decided to call the Actors'
Union as soon as I got back home.

23:24.021 --> 23:29.049
But I didn't really expect to find a
Ginny Malcolm listed with any of them.

23:29.126 --> 23:34.189
I had a feeling that her only acting job
had been as Robin's helpless house sitter.

23:35.132 --> 23:38.192
Exactly what role Higgins was playing,
I wasn't sure.

23:38.268 --> 23:41.396
But I was certain
that he was playing one.

23:41.471 --> 23:44.838
The next step was to find
out if he was working solo,

23:44.908 --> 23:48.639
or working in the same cast
with Ginny and Dan Davis.

24:13.136 --> 24:15.297
Dan hadn't worked at the
Estate for several months,

24:15.372 --> 24:17.363
so I had to wonder
if the address I'd found

24:17.441 --> 24:20.877
on the old employment records
was still current.

24:24.848 --> 24:27.248
I didn't have to wonder
for long.

24:27.317 --> 24:30.377
And I just couldn't convince myself
that Ginny had followed Dan home

24:30.454 --> 24:33.218
because she wanted to be
his house sitter, too.

24:33.290 --> 24:37.624
I was convinced that she was right in the
middle of whatever had gotten messed up.

24:37.694 --> 24:39.457
And if she was in the middle,

24:39.529 --> 24:42.862
it was possible that
Higgins was right at the top.

24:42.933 --> 24:44.628
Or the bottom.

25:04.354 --> 25:06.219
Don't touch her.

25:08.391 --> 25:09.756
She's dead.

25:14.430 --> 25:17.695
Why did Ginny ask you to
meet her at Dan Davis' house?

25:17.766 --> 25:19.290
Who are you?

25:19.368 --> 25:22.394
HPD.
Can I see some lD?

25:22.471 --> 25:27.738
Well, I left it downtown. I'd be happy
to run you in and show it to you there.

25:27.810 --> 25:30.472
You were going to tell me
about Ginny?

25:30.546 --> 25:33.640
Well, she called me, left this address,
said it was important.

25:33.716 --> 25:37.083
Come on, Magnum, you're bound to
have some idea of what she wanted.

25:37.152 --> 25:40.485
Magnum? I don't remember
introducing myself.

25:41.757 --> 25:43.691
But tell me
what you're looking for.

25:43.759 --> 25:46.057
She may have said something
about it to me.

25:46.128 --> 25:48.187
How much do you know
about her?

25:48.263 --> 25:50.356
She told me enough.

25:50.432 --> 25:53.697
Did she say if she talked
to the Chancellor?

25:53.769 --> 25:57.500
Chancellor?
Yeah, a few times. Why?

25:58.941 --> 26:00.533
You can go.

26:01.176 --> 26:02.336
No more questions?

26:02.411 --> 26:03.935
No, Magnum, you get
no more answers.

26:04.013 --> 26:07.505
You don't know what's going on.
This is over your head.

26:07.883 --> 26:09.942
Now get out of here.

26:25.401 --> 26:27.232
Oh, by the way,

26:28.470 --> 26:30.995
welcome to
the local police force.

26:34.043 --> 26:35.635
T.C.: What makes you think
they're Intelligence?

26:35.711 --> 26:38.305
What else?
They're definitely not HPD.

26:38.380 --> 26:41.349
Well, there is another possibility.
They could have killed her themselves.

26:41.417 --> 26:44.784
Then concocted some elaborate
investigation just to fool me?

26:44.853 --> 26:48.482
When they could have shot me too?
No, I don't think so.

26:49.191 --> 26:51.318
I think they were definitely
staking out the place.

26:51.393 --> 26:54.089
Well, if they were there, why didn't
they just grab Davis when he killed her?

26:54.163 --> 26:55.790
I don't know.
Maybe they were used to

26:55.864 --> 26:58.458
Ginny sticking around
after he left.

27:00.769 --> 27:03.863
You know, I think
she was one of their agents.

27:03.939 --> 27:05.907
Hey, man,
what's going on here?

27:05.974 --> 27:08.704
I checked with the British Home Office.
I mean...

27:08.777 --> 27:11.439
Higgins' visa was canceled
when he lost his job.

27:11.513 --> 27:15.108
He was ordered back to England
except he never got there.

27:15.184 --> 27:19.018
I think Ginny put on a real
convincing act just to keep me here.

27:19.088 --> 27:21.989
And those guys
at Dan Davis' house

27:22.057 --> 27:23.820
were just
inheriting her job.

27:23.892 --> 27:26.292
Why can't I get
that drawer open?

27:30.265 --> 27:32.096
What are you doing?

27:33.068 --> 27:35.536
This drawer's been fitted with
some kind of new safety lock.

27:35.604 --> 27:37.572
I need
a very large pick.

27:39.341 --> 27:41.866
The guys in that house were looking
for something. Something important.

27:41.944 --> 27:44.879
Something they thought
Ginny should have.

27:44.947 --> 27:49.077
Now either Dan Davis took it with him,
or it might be in this drawer.

27:50.752 --> 27:52.276
May l?

27:52.354 --> 27:55.812
I mean, there's a very simple and
scientific way to get in this drawer.

27:55.891 --> 27:58.792
It's based on the principle
of leverage.

27:59.161 --> 28:01.288
Could you stand back, please?

28:07.369 --> 28:08.859
Metal?

28:13.509 --> 28:15.374
This drawer's been fitted
with a sleeve.

28:17.312 --> 28:20.406
Well, there'd better be more in
there besides Higgins' memoirs.

28:20.482 --> 28:21.881
There is.

28:24.686 --> 28:26.244
Hey, you're right.

28:27.389 --> 28:29.152
Ginny shouldn't have
needed any help.

28:29.224 --> 28:32.284
No, Higgins told her everything.
Wait a minute.

28:34.463 --> 28:38.593
"Chateau Lafite, Special Reserve."
No wonder she couldn't find it.

28:41.003 --> 28:45.099
Robin's Special Reserve.
Two hundred bucks a sip and up.

28:45.174 --> 28:48.234
Higgins wrote "Special Reserve"
in his instructions to Ginny,

28:48.310 --> 28:49.800
but he forgot to tell her
where to find it,

28:49.878 --> 28:52.745
which means he's probably
never made contact with her.

28:52.814 --> 28:55.339
Oh, come on, nobody drinks
something worth this kind of money.

28:55.417 --> 28:56.782
That's right.
It's just for investment.

28:56.852 --> 28:59.446
So, what I'd like to know
is, why he had Ginny pull one

28:59.521 --> 29:03.184
for some alleged guests who were
supposed to show up here tonight.

29:03.258 --> 29:06.625
Oh, found it.
"Chateau Lafite, 1938."

29:07.196 --> 29:08.788
Oops, wait a minute.

29:08.864 --> 29:13.096
"Access code, Dothan 1332.
Virginia-Chancellor, 1400 every day."

29:13.168 --> 29:14.533
Make any sense to you?

29:14.603 --> 29:17.299
A lot. If Ginny is Virginia
and Higgins is the Chancellor.

29:17.372 --> 29:20.034
I think they're supposed to
make contact at 1400.

29:20.108 --> 29:22.338
Uh-oh. We'd better hurry.

29:35.123 --> 29:37.023
T.C.: Right on time.

29:38.527 --> 29:39.892
Virginia.

29:42.164 --> 29:43.597
Contact!

29:45.500 --> 29:46.728
"Delayed.

29:46.802 --> 29:50.329
"Could not find wine."

29:54.610 --> 29:57.340
Wine! Look, could you two
get on with this?

29:57.412 --> 29:59.505
I have to answer him, T.C.

30:19.134 --> 30:21.034
Kahalana Nursery. Dan Davis.

30:21.103 --> 30:23.128
They're running weapons
out of that nursery.

30:23.205 --> 30:26.641
Never mind all that. Could you just
ask this thing exactly where he's at?

30:40.455 --> 30:41.945
He's gone.

30:43.825 --> 30:46.885
"Takeover maneuver set."

30:47.162 --> 30:51.792
Maybe it's an exercise. You know,
war games. Military-sanctioned.

30:52.234 --> 30:55.761
Could be. In which case,
this'll all just be an exercise.

30:55.837 --> 30:58.237
And if it's not?
I'll call.

30:58.307 --> 31:02.676
Yeah. If we don't hear from you by
sunrise, we're coming in to get you.

31:03.245 --> 31:05.042
I wish I had
a better fix on this location

31:05.113 --> 31:07.513
other than
somewhere in the Koolaus.

31:07.582 --> 31:09.914
You'd better let me out here.

31:13.855 --> 31:17.291
Hey. You be careful.
They could be playing for real.

32:06.875 --> 32:09.708
- What's left?
- Two more crates.

32:30.966 --> 32:32.558
Let's go.

33:36.765 --> 33:37.754
Turn left.

33:37.899 --> 33:39.423
Turning.

34:03.091 --> 34:06.652
I did what I had to do.
I'd seen her talking to an undercover...

34:06.728 --> 34:08.753
That didn't give you
the right to kill her.

34:08.830 --> 34:11.094
The hell it didn't. She was on to us.
She could have messed up

34:11.166 --> 34:12.257
the whole invasion plan.

34:12.333 --> 34:15.268
You had no proof that she
was an intelligence agent.

34:15.337 --> 34:18.306
I told you, I saw her
with a fed yesterday.

34:18.373 --> 34:20.705
You know undercover agents
on sight, I suppose?

34:20.775 --> 34:22.538
The weapons dealers do.

34:22.610 --> 34:25.978
They fingered a guy Ginny was
talking to a few weeks ago

34:26.047 --> 34:27.309
and pointed him out to me!

34:27.382 --> 34:29.782
You still acted rashly
and without authority!

34:29.851 --> 34:33.081
No, Jonathan.
Dan discussed the matter with me.

34:33.154 --> 34:34.553
I gave him the order
to kill her.

34:37.592 --> 34:39.456
Why wasn't I informed?

34:40.695 --> 34:42.686
There simply wasn't time.

34:42.764 --> 34:46.130
Besides, you might have
tried to warn her.

34:49.971 --> 34:51.495
You believe this?

34:51.572 --> 34:54.337
I don't want to. But you are the one
that brought her into the movement.

34:56.011 --> 34:58.844
I have given up everything
to be here.

35:00.282 --> 35:02.546
That's exactly
what Ginny said.

35:02.617 --> 35:03.948
That's enough!

35:04.019 --> 35:06.783
You're being insubordinate
to a superior.

35:06.855 --> 35:10.552
We all have a great deal to do
before we move out tomorrow.

35:20.802 --> 35:23.202
I have my duties
to attend to as well.

35:23.271 --> 35:25.762
Yes. Yes, of course.

35:26.741 --> 35:31.075
Tempers are always a little frayed
on the eve of a great undertaking.

35:38.653 --> 35:40.018
Higgins.

35:41.456 --> 35:43.856
Let's get out of here.
Come on.

35:46.361 --> 35:48.158
Guards! Quickly!

35:54.169 --> 35:55.693
What's the problem,
Jonathan?

35:55.770 --> 35:58.204
This man is an intruder
in the camp.

35:58.273 --> 35:59.763
Is he?

36:00.475 --> 36:02.909
Then we'll have to shoot him.

36:10.400 --> 36:11.890
Ice Pick's
gonna have a little talk

36:11.969 --> 36:14.938
with the gun dealers
Dan Davis bought from.

36:15.672 --> 36:19.506
He said that he wouldn't do it for
the feds, but he'd do it for us.

36:19.576 --> 36:21.441
You mean, the feds
are leaning on him, too?

36:21.512 --> 36:22.604
Oh, yeah, real hard.

36:22.679 --> 36:24.476
According to Ice Pick,
the Army's ready to move

36:24.548 --> 36:27.210
just as soon as they get a
fix on the location. Yeah?

36:27.284 --> 36:30.685
He said he'd call us on the shortwave
as soon as he found the camp.

36:30.754 --> 36:32.722
And he also said that
he hoped that we'd enjoy

36:32.790 --> 36:35.725
having a couple of friends
along with us on the trip.

36:35.793 --> 36:38.318
Yeah, well,
we may need more friends than that.

36:38.395 --> 36:40.795
I mean, Thomas would have reached
us by morning like he promised

36:40.864 --> 36:43.025
if he wasn't in big trouble.

36:46.270 --> 36:47.897
What're you doing?
Calling the cops?

36:47.971 --> 36:49.734
Friendlier than that.

36:50.574 --> 36:54.874
This is Niner Five Alpha calling
Army dispatch. Do you read me?

36:56.013 --> 36:57.913
Go ahead,
Niner Five Alpha.

36:58.248 --> 37:01.411
There is but one
landing strip in the Dothans,

37:01.485 --> 37:02.577
Iocated here.

37:02.653 --> 37:06.555
Just north of the military headquarters
and the Presidential Palace.

37:06.857 --> 37:09.348
We shall land our plane there
at precisely 2300 hours.

37:25.142 --> 37:27.042
Please leave us.

37:37.955 --> 37:42.892
I'm not buying it, Higgins.
You as a second banana in a military dictatorship.

37:46.797 --> 37:49.823
My proper title will be
Chancellor of the Dothan lslands.

37:49.900 --> 37:52.061
I'm not buying that either.

37:52.502 --> 37:53.730
What are you
really doing here?

37:53.837 --> 37:58.274
Magnum, why, for once, couldn't
you have stayed out of my affairs?

37:58.342 --> 38:01.004
I was worried about you.
I just wanted to help.

38:01.478 --> 38:05.676
Yes, I know and I appreciate the
concern and the good intentions but...

38:09.086 --> 38:11.816
But you were afraid
I'd blow your cover.

38:12.389 --> 38:15.119
That's why you couldn't
tell me about it.

38:18.428 --> 38:23.491
My orders were explicit. I was allowed
to tell no one but Mr. Masters.

38:25.636 --> 38:27.501
You're back with Ml6.

38:28.405 --> 38:30.134
I suppose that amuses you.

38:30.207 --> 38:33.973
Uh-uh. No, I'm just relieved
to know the truth.

38:34.044 --> 38:36.774
I am surprised they pulled
you back after all this time.

38:36.847 --> 38:39.748
Precisely for that reason.
Time.

38:39.816 --> 38:43.081
Justin was with Ml6 himself
after my days there.

38:43.153 --> 38:46.611
There was some concern that he might
recognize an agent of more recent vintage.

38:46.690 --> 38:49.659
I'm sure there were other
reasons, Higgins. You're good.

38:49.726 --> 38:51.660
But you did make
one mistake, though.

38:51.728 --> 38:56.028
You forgot to tell Ginny where
the Special Reserve wine was kept.

38:56.099 --> 38:58.260
But you are good, Higgins.

38:58.335 --> 39:00.963
Thank you. Likewise.

39:03.040 --> 39:06.134
I had really thought I could
keep you from finding me.

39:06.209 --> 39:07.574
Right.

39:09.846 --> 39:11.541
Maybe we should
skip the compliments

39:11.615 --> 39:15.517
and concentrate on getting me
out of here before they shoot me.

39:16.553 --> 39:18.851
I can't help you escape,
Magnum.

39:20.057 --> 39:21.115
What?

39:21.191 --> 39:23.921
I must keep Justin's confidence
until the invasion begins.

39:23.994 --> 39:26.758
My orders are to lead him
into a trap.

39:26.830 --> 39:28.798
It's not like
he's invading England.

39:28.865 --> 39:30.992
He's trying to overthrow
a friendly nation.

39:31.068 --> 39:34.401
An act which would be disastrous to
both our nations should he succeed.

39:34.471 --> 39:37.599
My assignment is to stop
him and I must complete it.

39:37.674 --> 39:39.301
We'll stop him here.

39:39.376 --> 39:42.038
We'll get rid of the guards and make
for the truck while it's still quiet.

39:42.112 --> 39:43.875
As soon as we get to a phone,
we'll call the police.

39:43.947 --> 39:48.077
Justin might pull out ahead of
schedule before they would arrive.

39:55.258 --> 39:59.058
You can just get out while he's
still giving his briefing speech.

39:59.129 --> 40:01.461
Make a run for the truck.
Leave the guards to me.

40:01.531 --> 40:03.556
You're gonna stay here
after you help me escape?

40:03.633 --> 40:05.362
You're not only gonna lose
Justin's confidence,

40:05.435 --> 40:07.198
you're gonna end up
taking my place.

40:10.273 --> 40:12.138
That's my affair.

40:13.110 --> 40:15.510
Magnum, I can't
desert my post.

40:18.415 --> 40:20.576
No, I guess you can't.

40:21.551 --> 40:23.917
What if
your post deserts you?

40:28.091 --> 40:31.083
And follow the
dirt road into Hanaki Valley.

40:31.161 --> 40:33.220
Hanaki Valley. Got it.

40:33.296 --> 40:36.288
Hey, thanks, Ice Pick.
We're on our way.

40:36.366 --> 40:40.598
Now, I'll contact
the Army dispatch

40:40.670 --> 40:42.228
and tell them
to get a move on.

40:42.305 --> 40:45.604
T. C: Army dispatch,
this is Niner Fiver Alpha...

40:45.675 --> 40:47.438
We read you, Niner Five Alpha.

40:47.511 --> 40:50.173
There are light anti-tank weapons
in each machine-gun bunker.

40:50.247 --> 40:51.976
Yes, I know what LAW is.
How many are there?

40:52.049 --> 40:54.017
We're not sure precisely.

41:01.391 --> 41:03.518
General Higgins will make his...

41:08.031 --> 41:12.058
Upon General Higgins' signal,
when Alexia has been taken, I shall move

41:12.135 --> 41:16.071
onto the islands of Apurnia
and Napolea and secure them

41:16.139 --> 41:17.128
with only a guard
and five men.

41:17.340 --> 41:18.637
Halt!

41:18.742 --> 41:20.334
We should expect...

41:53.210 --> 41:55.144
I'll get the plane.

42:01.685 --> 42:03.243
Get behind me!

42:09.359 --> 42:12.726
T.C.: Hang on, Orville,
we're going in. It'll be tight.

42:16.032 --> 42:17.329
Get the fuel dump.

42:36.953 --> 42:39.046
Regroup, regroup.
Davis...

42:45.095 --> 42:47.029
Let's get out of here.

43:01.912 --> 43:03.345
Let's go!

43:04.981 --> 43:06.505
Reloading!

43:32.475 --> 43:33.999
Get the ammo!

44:01.871 --> 44:04.738
I think a timely retreat
is in order, Chancellor.

44:04.808 --> 44:06.469
I think you're right.

44:06.543 --> 44:08.010
Let's go.

44:15.518 --> 44:16.610
Let's go now.
Come on!

44:33.503 --> 44:36.995
Magnum, please go away.

44:37.941 --> 44:39.704
Morning, Higgins.

44:42.145 --> 44:45.672
For God's sake,
what do you want? It's 6:00 a.m.

44:45.749 --> 44:47.876
You're always up at 6:00.

44:49.653 --> 44:51.678
I spent the entire night
with the accountants.

44:51.755 --> 44:54.155
I've been in bed
for exactly one hour.

44:54.224 --> 44:55.384
With the accountants?

44:57.961 --> 44:59.792
Claims were necessary
for the replacement

44:59.863 --> 45:02.730
of Mr. Masters' objets d'art
and the missing funds.

45:02.799 --> 45:04.198
The British
and American governments

45:04.267 --> 45:06.565
graciously offered to cover
all losses from the outset.

45:06.636 --> 45:08.570
Now, what do you want?

45:09.039 --> 45:11.269
Just to tell you
I'm leaving.

45:13.076 --> 45:15.544
Oh, well,
Molokai for about a week.

45:15.612 --> 45:18.945
I thought it would be best
for Zeus and Apollo.

45:19.015 --> 45:21.142
It's not an uncommon
thing to happen.

45:21.217 --> 45:23.685
They lose somebody...
Oh, yes, yes.

45:23.753 --> 45:25.721
They lose somebody
they care about

45:25.789 --> 45:29.384
and they just lock onto anybody
they associate with that person.

45:29.459 --> 45:30.858
What is your point?

45:30.927 --> 45:32.918
The point is, Higgins,
they don't seem to be

45:32.996 --> 45:35.521
adjusting back
to the real thing. You.

45:37.233 --> 45:39.030
They keep hanging around
my place,

45:39.102 --> 45:41.696
so I just thought
it'd be best if I left

45:41.771 --> 45:44.467
and put temptation
out of their sight.

45:45.975 --> 45:47.408
Thank you.

45:51.147 --> 45:53.809
What would you
have done, Higgins?

45:53.883 --> 45:55.510
Would you have let them
shoot me?

46:03.259 --> 46:07.025
What I would have done,
Magnum, was what I did.

46:10.967 --> 46:13.458
I put your bridge back
in the study.

46:14.604 --> 46:16.231
Thank you.

46:17.874 --> 46:22.868
And thank you for not taking the Chateau
Lafite-Rothschild, 1938. Very decent.

46:23.813 --> 46:27.715
However, the wine you took
instead was a quite fine one.

46:27.784 --> 46:30.548
But at least
not irreplaceable.

46:31.888 --> 46:35.119
For God's sake,
don't drink it chilled.

46:39.596 --> 46:41.655
Zeus, Apollo, stay.
