<i> Previously on Van Helsing.</i>

00:02.503 --> 00:03.502
Wendy!!!

00:03.504 --> 00:04.903
Get your ass inside now!!!

00:04.905 --> 00:05.604
My wife is out there.

00:05.606 --> 00:06.672
I thought she got in.

00:06.674 --> 00:08.007
There is nothing I can do
about that, I'm sorry.

00:08.009 --> 00:09.074
Is that the Doc?

00:09.076 --> 00:11.076
It happened right when you
and the boys had it out.

00:11.078 --> 00:12.311
One of them got a hold of her.

00:12.313 --> 00:13.645
There's got to be a way to fix
this thing, right?

00:13.647 --> 00:15.280
( roars )

00:15.282 --> 00:16.648
I have a daughter, Dylan.

00:16.650 --> 00:18.150
That is all I know
or care about.

00:18.152 --> 00:19.284
Hello?

00:20.421 --> 00:21.186
Mommy, you can't leave me.

00:21.188 --> 00:22.187
Please, no!

00:25.459 --> 00:26.925
He was one of them, I saw him!

00:26.927 --> 00:28.260
Goddamn feeders.

00:28.262 --> 00:29.361
Check his eyes, bro.

00:29.363 --> 00:30.796
They're frickin' human.

02:08.429 --> 02:11.130
( winces in pain )

02:55.042 --> 02:59.845
<i> ( sirens outside )</i>

02:59.847 --> 03:02.214
Oh shit, what's
going on?

03:06.020 --> 03:07.786
What is that?

03:09.957 --> 03:12.291
What's all the noise about?

03:12.293 --> 03:17.496
( sirens continue )

04:14.355 --> 04:15.988
( horn honks )

04:15.990 --> 04:17.089
Hey!

04:17.091 --> 04:19.491
Hey, buddy!

04:19.493 --> 04:21.760
You gotta stay inside.

04:21.762 --> 04:23.228
Not anymore, I don't.

04:23.230 --> 04:24.763
Aaauuugh!

04:34.174 --> 04:35.607
( screams )

04:55.296 --> 04:56.328
Hey, excuse me.

04:56.330 --> 04:59.231
Excuse me, what
the hell is going on?

04:59.233 --> 05:00.799
( growls )

05:09.243 --> 05:11.043
Honey, is that you?

05:15.215 --> 05:16.615
Daddy!

05:21.255 --> 05:26.224
( low growls )

05:29.963 --> 05:33.298
( screaming )

05:41.475 --> 05:43.175
So, like... there's this crazy
Ninja thing

05:43.177 --> 05:47.145
and then just rams the knife
in her hand through Ted's head.

05:47.147 --> 05:52.551
She rips it off and then
takes the knife, takes the...

05:52.553 --> 05:54.319
Oh yeah, after taking
the knife out of her hand

05:54.321 --> 05:58.357
she just rapidly heals like
the wound was not even there.

05:58.359 --> 06:00.759
Like nothing ever happened.

06:41.802 --> 06:43.635
<i> ( Man's Voice ):  Hello?!</i>

06:48.809 --> 06:51.410
<i> Anybody there?</i>

06:52.980 --> 06:54.946
<i> Anybody?</i>

06:54.948 --> 06:55.714
Did you hear that?

06:55.716 --> 06:57.482
Yeah.

06:57.484 --> 06:58.750
<i> Hello?</i>

07:04.358 --> 07:05.724
<i> Anybody!</i>

07:09.763 --> 07:12.063
<i> Hello?</i>

07:17.237 --> 07:19.237
<i> Anybody there?</i>

07:27.181 --> 07:29.047
<i> Anybody?</i>

07:34.588 --> 07:36.087
<i> Hello?</i>

07:47.935 --> 07:50.101
Please help me.

07:50.103 --> 07:51.937
Please, please, please.

07:51.939 --> 07:53.238
Who are you?

07:53.240 --> 07:53.905
What's going on?

07:53.907 --> 07:55.240
Who are you people?

08:02.416 --> 08:05.150
Take your goddamn
clothes off.

08:05.152 --> 08:06.551
Now.

08:09.389 --> 08:10.889
NOW!

08:54.034 --> 08:56.701
I don't care what your eyes
look like now.

08:56.703 --> 08:58.837
You're one of them.

08:58.839 --> 09:01.406
How can you even live
with yourself?

09:01.408 --> 09:02.841
Huh?

09:02.843 --> 09:06.978
After drinking human blood.

09:06.980 --> 09:08.914
Who says I can?

09:18.358 --> 09:19.858
I don't know what the hell
he thinks I did.

09:22.162 --> 09:26.231
He was a feeder
and now he's not.

09:26.233 --> 09:30.068
That doesn't happen,
just so you know.

09:30.070 --> 09:31.803
It wasn't me.

09:31.805 --> 09:33.471
Maybe it was something
down that shaft.

09:33.473 --> 09:34.739
I threw a lot of bodies
down that shaft.

09:34.741 --> 09:36.441
Nothing's ever come back up.

09:39.880 --> 09:43.014
There's nothing special
about me, ok?

09:43.016 --> 09:44.916
I'm way below special.

09:44.918 --> 09:47.085
I haven't been protecting
you for three years

09:47.087 --> 09:50.889
because you're not special!

09:50.891 --> 09:55.160
Look.

09:55.162 --> 09:58.897
Doc said your body was...

09:58.899 --> 10:01.900
acting differently.

10:01.902 --> 10:03.969
I don't know,
maybe you're um...

10:03.971 --> 10:07.439
<i> ( screaming outside )</i>

10:07.441 --> 10:10.175

Wendy! Wendy!

10:32.432 --> 10:35.600
Shit, it's his goddamn wife.

10:35.602 --> 10:36.568
( growling )

10:36.570 --> 10:38.136
No!

10:38.138 --> 10:40.138
( whipping begins )

10:40.440 --> 10:42.641
<i> We'll stop when you give us</i>
<i> the dead girl.</i>

10:49.249 --> 10:50.415
Give her over.

10:50.417 --> 10:51.616
Back off.

10:51.618 --> 10:52.450
I'm going.

10:52.452 --> 10:53.151
No! Vanessa!

10:53.153 --> 10:54.219
I have to go down there.

10:54.221 --> 10:55.253
( groans )

10:56.990 --> 10:58.523
Wait you're not going anywhere.

10:59.493 --> 11:00.659
Stop!

11:05.399 --> 11:06.264
I got her!

11:06.266 --> 11:07.799
I'll trade!

11:07.801 --> 11:09.200
Back away from her!

11:09.202 --> 11:10.602
Now!

11:12.839 --> 11:13.672
I've got her!

11:13.674 --> 11:14.906
I'll throw her over!

11:14.908 --> 11:15.907
No!

11:15.909 --> 11:17.776
Alive!

11:18.478 --> 11:20.779
Nooooo!

11:20.781 --> 11:21.646
( gun shot )

11:21.648 --> 11:23.014
( screams )

11:31.958 --> 11:33.458
You killed her,
you bastard!

11:33.460 --> 11:42.767
( groaning )

11:42.769 --> 11:46.371
Your wife was dead the second
you lost track of her out there!

11:46.373 --> 11:47.205
You left her behind.

11:47.207 --> 11:48.206
That's on you.

11:53.313 --> 11:54.512
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!

12:00.587 --> 12:02.153
Nooooo!

12:06.059 --> 12:07.392
That's great.

12:07.394 --> 12:09.561
We now have three hours
to live.

12:24.544 --> 12:26.344
You were one of them?

12:28.815 --> 12:32.417
And they want me?

12:32.419 --> 12:33.685
They told me to turn
the dead girl.

12:33.687 --> 12:35.520
That's all I know.

12:46.700 --> 12:48.566
I don't get it, first the hand,
now this!

12:48.568 --> 12:49.934
Shhh!

13:07.854 --> 13:09.387
( screeching )

13:09.389 --> 13:10.421
Three hours?

13:10.423 --> 13:11.322
Yeah.

13:11.324 --> 13:12.690
Turbine charged
the car batteries,

13:12.692 --> 13:14.125
car batteries kept
the UV lights running

13:14.127 --> 13:17.295
and skin-frying is our primary
source of defense.

13:17.297 --> 13:18.763
So when the batteries die...

13:18.765 --> 13:21.566
So do we.

13:21.568 --> 13:24.302
There's a generator down
in the basement.

13:24.304 --> 13:26.604
It's been out of commission
for a year.

13:26.606 --> 13:27.305
I know where to get
some parts

13:27.307 --> 13:31.209
but it's not going to be pretty.

13:31.211 --> 13:33.945
How come you didn't shoot
those things down there?

13:33.947 --> 13:35.580
At least try and save that
woman?

13:35.582 --> 13:36.614
It's a waste of ammo.

13:36.616 --> 13:38.449
They just keep coming.

13:38.451 --> 13:40.018
I don't fall for bait.

13:40.020 --> 13:42.387
Not anymore.

13:42.389 --> 13:45.924
Anyway,

13:45.926 --> 13:48.827
if I'm not back by the time
the UV lights go down...

13:48.829 --> 13:51.162
( sighs )

13:51.164 --> 13:52.130
It was nice staring
at your naked body

13:52.132 --> 13:55.266
for three years.

13:55.268 --> 13:56.434
I'm coming with you.

13:56.436 --> 13:57.802
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
you're not.

13:57.804 --> 13:59.470
It's safer that way.

14:06.780 --> 14:08.780
You promise you're gonna
stick close?

14:08.782 --> 14:11.449
You're not gonna try
and take off?

14:11.451 --> 14:12.684
One trip out there,

14:12.686 --> 14:14.819
you're gonna realize there's
no way your daughter survived.

14:14.821 --> 14:17.722
It's not possible,
not in this world.

14:28.668 --> 14:29.968
No one goes in,
no one goes out.

14:29.970 --> 14:31.903
And no one hurts Doc.

14:31.905 --> 14:32.804
And keep an eye on that
other guy,

14:32.806 --> 14:34.672
make sure he doesn't go postal.

14:34.674 --> 14:35.974
Oh, the feeder dude?

14:35.976 --> 14:38.309
His name's Flesh.

14:38.311 --> 14:39.377
Oh, sorry.

14:39.379 --> 14:40.979
Ex-feeder dude.

14:40.981 --> 14:42.313
How'd he get a tag like
"Flesh"?

14:42.315 --> 14:44.716
I didn't wanna go there but
I guess he's keeping it.

14:44.718 --> 14:45.550
You know how to use
this thing?

14:45.552 --> 14:46.684
Yep.

14:49.623 --> 14:51.389
Now watch out for John,
he's an asshole.

14:53.360 --> 14:56.661
If you screw this up
I will hunt you.

14:59.733 --> 15:01.399
No one hurts Doc.

15:01.401 --> 15:02.667
Got it.

15:22.956 --> 15:25.056
Once we get down
below street level

15:25.058 --> 15:27.592
we're outside the safe zone.

15:27.594 --> 15:29.360
You gotta keep your head on
a swivel 'cause down there,

15:29.362 --> 15:33.698
trust me, you can run
into anything.

15:33.700 --> 15:36.034
Here, take this.

15:36.036 --> 15:37.602
Get them in the heart,
get them on the ground,

15:37.604 --> 15:38.703
get their heads off.

15:38.705 --> 15:39.637
It's the only way you can
make sure

15:39.639 --> 15:41.105
they're not gonna heal up
and circle back.

15:41.107 --> 15:43.341
Wait, they- they heal up
that fast?

15:43.343 --> 15:44.842
Kinda like you.

15:44.844 --> 15:46.144
You set?

15:46.146 --> 15:46.711
Yeah.

15:46.713 --> 15:47.912
Let's go.

15:54.354 --> 15:56.187
Welcome to the sub-basement.

16:00.627 --> 16:03.928
Are you sure you know
where you're going?

16:03.930 --> 16:06.297
It's been a while.

16:06.299 --> 16:10.301
I'm more of a stay-home
kinda guy.

16:10.303 --> 16:14.605
Is that your excuse for watching
over me all those years?

16:14.607 --> 16:18.710
Most guys would have left.

16:18.712 --> 16:20.745
I'm a marine.

16:20.747 --> 16:22.714
It was my duty.

16:27.887 --> 16:29.387
You think that's lame?

16:32.459 --> 16:34.225
No.

16:36.896 --> 16:40.131
Somebody thought you
were important.

16:40.133 --> 16:44.335
It sure looks that way now.

16:44.337 --> 16:47.638
I don't want anything to do
with this.

16:47.640 --> 16:52.677
I'm pretty sure none of us do.

16:52.679 --> 16:57.281
What happened to you, anyway?

16:57.283 --> 17:00.184
The night you came in

17:00.186 --> 17:03.621
Doc says you were stabbed
beaten up,

17:03.623 --> 17:08.292
pretty much
totally bled out.

17:08.294 --> 17:10.028
I don't remember.

17:13.967 --> 17:15.500
Oh yeah.

17:36.156 --> 17:38.022
Shhh.

17:38.024 --> 17:39.490
( whispers ) Is that them?

17:47.567 --> 17:48.966
( growling )

17:48.968 --> 17:50.368
( whispers ) Follow me, run!

17:52.138 --> 17:53.671
Run!

17:53.673 --> 17:54.372
Move!

17:54.374 --> 17:55.673
Move!

17:59.879 --> 18:02.647
( growling )

18:07.887 --> 18:10.188
So much for the tunnels.

18:10.190 --> 18:12.056
Stay close, watch
the corners.

18:12.058 --> 18:14.625
Should be ok as long as
we stay out of the shadows.

18:23.069 --> 18:25.570
So-called Resistance.

18:25.572 --> 18:27.538
They're fighting back?

18:27.540 --> 18:29.841
Hope does all kinds of
bullshit to people's minds.

18:29.843 --> 18:31.843
Come on, let's go!

18:43.289 --> 18:47.091
( yelling, terrified )

18:47.093 --> 18:50.194
Jesus Christ almighty!

18:52.365 --> 18:54.298
( anxious shrieking )

19:06.312 --> 19:07.411
Why me?

19:29.602 --> 19:31.736
Hey.

19:31.738 --> 19:32.904
You ok?

19:32.906 --> 19:35.973
( anxious growling )

19:35.975 --> 19:39.277
I had a nightmare.

19:39.279 --> 19:44.949
I haven't dreamt in years.

19:44.951 --> 19:48.953
( anxious growling )

19:48.955 --> 19:50.021
( door rattles )

19:50.023 --> 19:52.156
Is it weird?

19:52.158 --> 19:56.294
You know, being
normal again.

19:56.296 --> 20:02.233
( shrieking )

20:02.235 --> 20:03.201
Shut up! Shut up!

20:03.203 --> 20:03.935
Shut up!

20:03.937 --> 20:05.269
Shut up!

20:05.271 --> 20:06.404
( Screaming )

20:06.406 --> 20:08.206
You heard me! Shut up!

20:08.208 --> 20:10.374
( Screaming )

20:22.322 --> 20:25.289
I say we kill them both
before the boy scout gets back.

20:25.291 --> 20:27.325
Let's do this.

20:27.327 --> 20:28.759
Touch them and you'll end up
down the chute

20:28.761 --> 20:32.230
like the rest of the people
the marines killed.

20:38.271 --> 20:39.837
Is that a threat?

20:39.839 --> 20:41.539
Are you threatening me?

20:41.541 --> 20:46.210
No, just pointing out
the obvious.

20:49.349 --> 20:51.716
What was that?

20:51.718 --> 20:53.317
What'd he say?

21:17.744 --> 21:18.576
The first year and a half

21:18.578 --> 21:20.544
I ran everything off
that generator.

21:20.546 --> 21:24.115
Scavenged every spare part
for ten square blocks,

21:24.117 --> 21:25.783
nearly died every time.

21:25.785 --> 21:27.918
Turned me right off
the combustion engine.

21:42.201 --> 21:44.802
Feeders fed off the passengers.

21:44.804 --> 21:47.071
Rats fed off whatever was left.

21:47.073 --> 21:49.407
Ferals fed off the rats.

21:49.409 --> 21:50.574
Ferals?

21:50.576 --> 21:52.810
It's crazy.
They'll suck anything.

21:52.812 --> 21:55.313
Not much human left in them.

21:58.718 --> 22:03.888
The bad news is,
engine's down there.

22:03.890 --> 22:05.156
They can't be down there,
right?

22:05.158 --> 22:07.124
Under water?

22:07.126 --> 22:09.360
I've seen different kinds.

22:09.362 --> 22:16.267
Not proper ferals or feeders,
but other things.

22:17.937 --> 22:20.404
We better move.

22:20.406 --> 22:22.640
Here, take this.

22:22.642 --> 22:23.841
If I tug on it, you take off.

22:23.843 --> 22:24.909
I don't want you messing

22:24.911 --> 22:26.510
with whatever's got a hold
on me down there, ok?

22:32.819 --> 22:34.085
And here.

22:35.888 --> 22:38.656
Safety's off,
watch your toes.

22:42.128 --> 22:44.128
Whew!

22:45.865 --> 22:47.765
Back in 90 seconds.

23:24.237 --> 23:27.872
( snarling )

23:27.874 --> 23:30.408
Oh, shit.

23:30.410 --> 23:31.509
Axel.

23:38.017 --> 23:39.116
Axel!

23:43.089 --> 23:44.288
Come on.

23:45.725 --> 23:47.525
( snarling )

23:47.527 --> 23:48.325
Shit!

23:48.327 --> 23:52.263
( gun fire )

23:54.333 --> 23:56.667
Come on!!

24:01.607 --> 24:03.908
( growling )

24:03.910 --> 24:11.015
( gun fire )

24:11.017 --> 24:11.982
( snarling )

24:13.853 --> 24:15.085
Come on!!!

24:23.863 --> 24:26.096
Had to fight the engine for it,
and you?

24:26.098 --> 24:27.398
They're here!

24:29.235 --> 24:30.701
Don't hesitate, just kill!

24:36.742 --> 24:37.741
( screams )

24:53.659 --> 24:56.227
( screams )

25:02.568 --> 25:03.267
Is it dead?!

25:03.269 --> 25:04.368
Is it dead?!

25:04.370 --> 25:05.769
Yeah, you killed it!

25:05.771 --> 25:07.171
Me?

25:09.342 --> 25:10.007
You're the one that should
be dead.

25:10.009 --> 25:12.743
Are you sure you're alright?

25:12.745 --> 25:15.980
That really used to be
a normal person?

25:15.982 --> 25:16.914
Listen, we gotta get outta here.

25:16.916 --> 25:18.716
Let's go. Come on.

25:32.465 --> 25:35.032
You are not seriously thinking
of ditching on me.

25:35.034 --> 25:36.967
Listen, you got some skills,
I'll give you that,

25:36.969 --> 25:38.235
but look at you.

25:38.237 --> 25:39.770
You're spent.

25:39.772 --> 25:41.372
I can hold my own.

25:41.374 --> 25:43.374
Yeah, against one or two.

25:43.376 --> 25:44.975
What if it's five or ten?

25:44.977 --> 25:46.877
I have to find Dylan.

25:46.879 --> 25:48.812
You're not gonna do her
any good if you're dead.

25:52.218 --> 25:53.651
What'll you do, huh?

25:53.653 --> 25:57.354
If those things are already in
back at the hospital?

25:57.356 --> 25:58.822
You gonna hand me over?

26:00.326 --> 26:02.226
No.

26:02.228 --> 26:04.061
Half the people back there
want to.

26:04.063 --> 26:05.696
They can all kiss my ass.

26:05.698 --> 26:07.197
Listen to me.

26:07.199 --> 26:12.336
No matter what happens,
I stick with you.

26:12.338 --> 26:15.239
You got me?

26:15.241 --> 26:17.408
Ok, come on, come on,
come on, we gotta go.

26:28.554 --> 26:30.087
Soup's up.

26:41.200 --> 26:42.533
That's it.

26:42.535 --> 26:44.768
We're all going to die.

26:46.439 --> 26:48.839
( growling )

26:50.343 --> 26:55.012
( feeders attacking outside )

26:55.014 --> 26:56.614
Grab your shit.

26:56.616 --> 26:57.247
Grab your shit!

26:57.249 --> 26:59.216
Let's go.

26:59.218 --> 26:59.650
Now.

26:59.652 --> 27:01.018
Go, go, go, go.

27:01.020 --> 27:02.419
Go! Go!

27:08.294 --> 27:11.695
<i>( attacking continues outside )</i>

27:31.751 --> 27:33.584
They're coming.

27:33.586 --> 27:36.920
( growling )

27:50.536 --> 27:52.903
Woah, woah,
woah, woah, wait.

27:54.573 --> 27:55.773
They'll kill them all.

27:55.775 --> 27:56.440
Yeah, yeah.

27:56.442 --> 27:57.174
Hold back a sec.

27:57.176 --> 27:58.442
Hold back a sec.

28:04.617 --> 28:07.184
Nikolai!

28:07.186 --> 28:09.486
Recognize me?

28:09.488 --> 28:10.721
What the hell is he doing?

28:16.328 --> 28:18.629
( growling )

28:18.631 --> 28:23.701
I bleed.

28:23.703 --> 28:27.705
I'm human.

28:27.707 --> 28:28.706
The dead woman turned me.

28:28.708 --> 28:30.374
She turned me back.

28:30.376 --> 28:32.509
( growling )

28:42.288 --> 28:44.588
Touch me.

28:44.590 --> 28:47.357
Come on.

28:47.359 --> 28:50.427
Come on. Take a bite.

28:50.429 --> 28:53.163
You wanna feel again?

28:53.165 --> 28:56.233
To suffer for the blood
you drank?

28:56.235 --> 28:59.369
Then come inside.

28:59.371 --> 29:03.373
The dead woman
will turn you.

29:03.375 --> 29:05.075
She'll turn you all.

29:22.695 --> 29:24.261
( low growl )

29:37.276 --> 29:38.509
Ok, let's go.

30:52.151 --> 30:54.184
Dylan's dead,
isn't she?

31:00.693 --> 31:08.966
After what I saw today,
she must be.

31:08.968 --> 31:11.668
It's just the world now.

31:16.141 --> 31:17.841
Those blood-suckers aren't
gonna stay scared off for long.

31:17.843 --> 31:20.177
I gotta get that generator
back up.

31:22.047 --> 31:23.614
Hey.

31:23.616 --> 31:25.616
She might have made it.

31:25.618 --> 31:27.684
I mean, I did, right?

31:33.025 --> 31:35.859
( Doc hissing )

31:50.276 --> 31:52.676
What am I? Do you know?

31:58.684 --> 32:02.185
What did you say to her?

32:02.187 --> 32:04.121
You're one of them,
aren't you?

32:10.162 --> 32:11.828
( cries out )

32:13.565 --> 32:15.999
( chuckling )

32:35.421 --> 32:37.921
Why'd you risk your life like
that out there?

32:37.923 --> 32:41.558
For them?

32:41.560 --> 32:46.396
Because most of them want
both of us dead.

32:46.398 --> 32:49.599
Do you just wanna die?

32:49.601 --> 32:51.735
Or were you trying to make
some big statement

32:51.737 --> 32:54.271
about how I'm the answer
to everything

32:54.273 --> 33:00.310
just to rile them up?

33:00.312 --> 33:03.613
Because I don't wanna be
anyone's answer to anything.

33:03.615 --> 33:06.149
I got my own shit to take
care of,

33:06.151 --> 33:08.151
and I don't need you
pushing me at these people

33:08.153 --> 33:13.490
as some saviour or destroyer
or whatever.

33:13.492 --> 33:15.158
I ripped the throat
out of my little girl

33:15.160 --> 33:16.326
as soon as I turned.

33:16.328 --> 33:19.229
She was five.

33:19.231 --> 33:21.732
And my wife tried to save
the baby,

33:21.734 --> 33:22.733
but I reached in

33:22.735 --> 33:24.701
and I pulled his heart
right out of his chest,

33:24.703 --> 33:27.637
right in her arms.

33:27.639 --> 33:31.508
But I didn't kill her.

33:31.510 --> 33:34.578
I left her there with them.

33:34.580 --> 33:41.351
Pieces of her children
all around her.

33:41.353 --> 33:44.221
You're right.

33:44.223 --> 33:45.889
You deserve to die.

33:45.891 --> 33:47.824
And I will.

33:47.826 --> 33:49.059
But on my terms.

33:49.061 --> 33:51.228
For them.

33:55.467 --> 33:56.700
If I found my wife and
she was one of them

33:56.702 --> 33:58.835
could you turn her back?

34:04.977 --> 34:06.676
How do I know?

34:09.248 --> 34:11.915
You sure she'd even want to?

34:11.917 --> 34:13.283
For a world like this?

34:13.285 --> 34:16.853
Because you don't feel
when you're one of them.

34:16.855 --> 34:18.555
No guilt for anything.

34:18.557 --> 34:21.925
You live in darkness.

34:21.927 --> 34:22.926
Pain is better.

34:22.928 --> 34:24.795
Misery is better.

34:27.699 --> 34:29.366
She'd want to turn back.

34:47.920 --> 34:51.721
We ran into a little
bit of trouble.

34:51.723 --> 34:56.026
But the UV light's back up.

34:56.028 --> 35:00.564
Hey, uh... can I talk to you
for a sec?

35:00.566 --> 35:03.567
I've got a favor to ask ya. A
big one.

35:04.903 --> 35:06.703
<i> It's about Doc.</i>

35:10.242 --> 35:11.975
It's her only shot.

35:11.977 --> 35:13.910
She could die.

35:13.912 --> 35:15.479
You saw what happened
to that feral.

35:15.481 --> 35:18.148
Yeah, and I saw what
happened to Flesh.

35:18.150 --> 35:20.750
Look, she's probably gonna
die anyway

35:20.752 --> 35:23.487
the way things are going.

35:23.489 --> 35:27.924
I have kept her safe
this long, but...

35:27.926 --> 35:30.961
eventually I am gonna
have to kill her.

35:35.000 --> 35:36.933
Please.

35:46.612 --> 35:48.345
Open the cage.

35:59.525 --> 36:04.995
( growling and snarling )

36:22.948 --> 36:25.749
( growling and snarling )

36:30.956 --> 36:32.455
Come on, Doc.

36:38.063 --> 36:38.862
Come on!

36:38.864 --> 36:40.163
Come on, go ahead and bite her.

36:40.165 --> 36:42.365
Just bite her and get it over
with, one way or the other.

36:45.571 --> 36:48.405
( growling )

36:50.442 --> 36:53.376
( cries out )

36:53.378 --> 36:54.144
Bite me!

36:54.146 --> 36:54.911
What the hell is this?

36:54.913 --> 36:55.845
Stay back!

36:55.847 --> 36:58.215
Come on, it's right there!

37:02.688 --> 37:04.054
( grunting )

37:08.360 --> 37:12.229
( screams )

37:30.882 --> 37:32.649
Doc?

37:37.556 --> 37:39.089
Doc?

38:13.458 --> 38:14.824
Hey, hey, hey.

38:14.826 --> 38:16.259
Hey.

38:16.261 --> 38:19.262
Hey, Doc.

38:19.264 --> 38:21.631
Doc?

38:26.305 --> 38:28.672
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

38:28.674 --> 38:29.506
Come on, baby.

38:29.508 --> 38:31.174
Come on.

38:31.176 --> 38:31.975
Come on, Doc.

38:31.977 --> 38:33.243
Talk to me.

38:39.918 --> 38:41.551
( screaming )

38:41.553 --> 38:43.853
( hissing )

38:45.924 --> 38:48.692
( screaming )

38:50.829 --> 38:54.030
( slurping sounds )

39:01.239 --> 39:03.540
( screaming continues )

39:18.724 --> 39:21.858
( growling and snarling )

39:30.635 --> 39:32.335
Julius...

39:37.409 --> 39:43.913
Flesh is... human.

39:43.915 --> 39:47.684
Says she turned him.

39:47.686 --> 39:49.686
Says she'll turn us all.

39:56.595 --> 39:59.262
Send word to Dmitri now.

39:59.264 --> 40:01.431
He needs to hear this.

40:24.122 --> 40:26.356
Come on, Doc. Don't leave me!

40:26.358 --> 40:28.291
Come on.

40:31.997 --> 40:32.962
Come on, Doc.  Don't go.

40:32.964 --> 40:34.597
Come on.

40:34.599 --> 40:35.765
Throw her down the chute.

40:35.767 --> 40:37.233
Shut the frick up!

40:42.774 --> 40:45.375
Did she try to turn her?

40:45.377 --> 40:45.909
Yeah.

40:45.911 --> 40:47.143
Is she dead?

40:47.145 --> 40:48.478
I don't know, man.

40:54.319 --> 40:56.419
Lasted a long time though,
didn't we?

41:01.493 --> 41:06.329
You saved my life, Doc.

41:06.331 --> 41:10.233
Should have let me save you.

41:10.235 --> 41:14.204
You know?

41:14.206 --> 41:16.105
You should have let me
save you.

41:20.312 --> 41:22.846
( coughing )

41:22.848 --> 41:23.947
Woah, woah, woah.

41:23.949 --> 41:24.481
Hey.

41:24.483 --> 41:25.515
Hey. Hey.

41:25.517 --> 41:27.784
( coughing )

41:27.786 --> 41:29.285
You ok?

41:35.594 --> 41:36.693
Come on, let's get you up.

41:36.695 --> 41:37.927
Let's get you up.
