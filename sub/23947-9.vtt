00:19.895 --> 00:21.897
I can do this all by myself!

00:39.081 --> 00:41.833
Lily! Burn this sight into your mind!

01:17.619 --> 01:20.038
EIGHTEEN HOURS LATER
ROYAL POLICE, COASTAL BRANCH

01:20.122 --> 01:21.999
I can't believe you used Lily.

01:22.624 --> 01:23.625
Is that a problem?

01:23.709 --> 01:24.668
INTERROGATION ROOM

01:24.751 --> 01:25.585
Not really.

01:29.339 --> 01:31.091
You're going to tell me, right?

01:31.300 --> 01:33.760
The reason why you turned yourself in?

01:34.303 --> 01:38.765
Reason? You've gotten to be paranoid.

01:39.224 --> 01:40.642
And whose fault is that?

01:47.774 --> 01:49.401
You know, right?

01:51.778 --> 01:55.407
<i>It's just that no one is noticing it.</i>

01:57.993 --> 01:58.827
I see.

02:01.204 --> 02:02.497
Let's review the facts.

02:02.706 --> 02:06.918
The instant Market Maker got involved,
clarifying the situation became pointless.

02:07.544 --> 02:11.590
So we only expose those parts
that reflect badly on the country.

02:13.216 --> 02:16.762
If whoever is in charge
of Market Maker has lost his mind

02:17.346 --> 02:20.182
and has been abusing his position,
what then?

02:21.224 --> 02:25.562
Whoever's been deriving pleasure
from killing my sister and tormenting me

02:25.646 --> 02:28.815
has been exploiting his position
as head of Market Maker

02:29.399 --> 02:32.611
<i>to commit a string of murders
<i>out of self-interest.</i></i>

02:33.111 --> 02:35.739
<i>We need to confront the country
<i>with that fact.</i></i>

02:35.822 --> 02:38.992
<i>Impossible. They must be
<i>the most tightly run organization.</i></i>

02:39.076 --> 02:40.452
<i>Exactly.</i>

02:41.078 --> 02:43.622
No one has realized
that madness has spread

02:43.789 --> 02:46.458
within an organization
that orchestrates madness.

02:47.751 --> 02:50.921
If what you say is true,
there's a single disease vector.

02:51.088 --> 02:51.922
Plus,

02:52.714 --> 02:55.717
you have a good idea who that vector is.

02:57.469 --> 02:59.137
Why aren't you acting on it?

03:01.598 --> 03:03.934
I don't have any incontrovertible proof.

03:04.976 --> 03:08.230
As far as I can tell,
he's followed the same daily routine

03:08.313 --> 03:11.733
for the past eight years,
never deviating from it even slightly.

03:12.025 --> 03:15.529
If we assume he still has homicidal urges,

03:15.612 --> 03:18.532
I don't know where
or when he commits murder.

03:18.907 --> 03:20.158
Homicidal urges?

03:21.326 --> 03:23.870
Our killer has impulse control disorder?

03:24.996 --> 03:27.749
Yeah. And not just him.

03:28.500 --> 03:30.585
You're saying he has accomplices?

03:30.752 --> 03:33.463
Well, it's not quite that.

03:34.798 --> 03:36.216
I'm still unsure, myself.

03:37.008 --> 03:40.095
So, I figured I'd come back
to confirm it in person.

03:40.762 --> 03:41.888
You don't mean...

03:42.264 --> 03:43.098
Yeah.

03:47.310 --> 03:49.479
The killer is close to us.

03:56.236 --> 03:59.489
In the few hours we have left,
how will you find the proof

03:59.573 --> 04:01.908
you couldn't uncover in eight years?

04:06.413 --> 04:10.667
Thanks to the runt behind that mirror,
nothing's gone according to plan.

04:10.959 --> 04:12.836
At this point, I can't do it by--

04:13.295 --> 04:15.422
You took too long to figure that out!

04:15.714 --> 04:18.341
"At this point"?
You couldn't before, either!

04:18.550 --> 04:21.303
You've got mental muscle,
but none anywhere else!

04:21.762 --> 04:23.972
You never could do anything by yourself!

04:24.264 --> 04:26.224
You just figured that out? Idiot!

04:27.517 --> 04:28.935
That's the real Eric.

04:29.019 --> 04:31.897
Even now, he can get like this
when he's drunk.

04:33.273 --> 04:34.107
Who knew?

04:34.441 --> 04:36.443
...and you dare to blame us?

04:41.239 --> 04:42.073
My apologies.

04:43.950 --> 04:47.120
I learned everything I know
about police work from you.

04:47.204 --> 04:48.330
I'm proud of that.

04:49.372 --> 04:54.169
I've always asked myself, "What would
Keith Flick do?" before I did anything.

04:57.005 --> 04:58.465
That's our cue.

04:58.757 --> 05:00.175
Took him long enough.

05:09.726 --> 05:11.144
What are you doing?

05:11.686 --> 05:16.608
Everyone here will follow
even your most absurd order exactly.

05:17.484 --> 05:22.113
I assembled the best talent I could find
and drilled what you taught me into them.

05:23.114 --> 05:24.741
Do you know why I did that?

05:29.704 --> 05:33.458
Eight years ago,
when we got fed up with that show trial,

05:34.167 --> 05:35.877
we plotted to kidnap Dead Kyle

05:35.961 --> 05:39.172
and bring to light all of the crimes
we had uncovered.

05:40.090 --> 05:42.717
The whole thing was my idea.

05:43.969 --> 05:47.597
But you acted on your own,
and as a result,

05:48.223 --> 05:51.768
I found myself in the awkward position
of having to arrest you.

05:53.395 --> 05:55.480
Why would you do such a thing?

05:57.649 --> 06:01.027
Was it to protect me?
Or had you simply lost control?

06:01.319 --> 06:03.280
To this day, I still don't know.

06:03.780 --> 06:08.368
But I have learned
what you and I were missing that day.

06:09.452 --> 06:10.287
And that's...

06:11.288 --> 06:12.122
a team.

06:15.667 --> 06:17.043
Give us our orders.

06:17.502 --> 06:20.880
For the next few hours,
we're your personal team.

06:24.926 --> 06:30.181
Either way, the instant we deliver you
to jail, the RIS will be disbanded.

06:31.099 --> 06:34.394
Let's turn this around!
Time for some giant killing!

06:38.815 --> 06:41.026
First, will you take these cuffs off?

06:41.359 --> 06:44.112
I can't do that. You're still a suspect.

06:45.614 --> 06:49.409
What do we do about Market Maker?
They'll definitely try to stop us.

06:49.534 --> 06:52.037
Don't worry. I have a play in motion.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.763
We'll use Lily as a decoy.

07:10.472 --> 07:12.349
Absolutely not! It's too dangerous!

07:12.766 --> 07:14.976
I'll do it even if you tell me not to!

07:15.393 --> 07:16.311
On what evidence?

07:16.937 --> 07:19.397
My first day back on the job,
I bugged him.

07:24.861 --> 07:25.820
Oh, I get it.

07:26.696 --> 07:28.949
Bugs that disappear are harder to spot.

07:29.032 --> 07:32.953
The pack only lasted a day.
He's a heavier smoker than I expected.

07:33.578 --> 07:35.038
Did you learn something?

07:36.122 --> 07:37.082
Just one thing.

07:40.168 --> 07:42.253
He still talks to Erika even now.

07:44.798 --> 07:45.882
What did you say?

07:47.008 --> 07:49.177
Kaela, let me borrow your eyeliner.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.388
Lily, take off your jacket.

07:55.058 --> 07:58.353
Ah, Ms. Hoshina.
What brings you here at this hour?

07:59.020 --> 08:01.147
Could I trouble you to sign this?

08:01.856 --> 08:03.149
Running errands?

08:03.483 --> 08:06.945
It's a long story.
I'm the only one who isn't doing anything.

08:07.028 --> 08:10.198
Oh. That business with Genie.
It must be difficult.

08:13.868 --> 08:16.371
These X-rays sure are strange.

08:18.164 --> 08:20.250
Oh, yes, they're quite unusual.

08:20.333 --> 08:21.501
Hardly any cases have--

08:29.342 --> 08:31.344
It's a rarely-documented
skeletal structure.

08:32.429 --> 08:33.638
Oh?

08:37.100 --> 08:38.226
Thank you very much.

08:40.645 --> 08:42.397
Do you still believe in him?

08:43.940 --> 08:46.609
I'm not really sure why. But, well...

08:49.904 --> 08:52.699
I'll keep believing in him to the end.

08:53.158 --> 08:57.579
You barely know the man,
but he's won your unwavering trust, I see.

08:58.288 --> 09:00.832
I don't know why. But...

09:02.834 --> 09:05.003
he's always on my mind.

09:08.131 --> 09:09.883
I bet I'm in love with him!

09:17.015 --> 09:19.517
What? It was an act! An act!

09:20.018 --> 09:21.936
Hey, don't be creeps!

09:23.104 --> 09:26.566
Anyway, we've set the bait.
All that's left--

09:26.775 --> 09:27.609
Keith?

09:29.319 --> 09:31.780
You suffer from chronic blushing, huh?

09:37.535 --> 09:40.497
Is this a trap set by Genie?
Or could she really...

09:43.041 --> 09:45.085
What do you make of this, Erika?

09:50.548 --> 09:51.382
Erika?

09:54.177 --> 09:55.970
Where are you, Erika?

09:59.057 --> 10:00.100
I've had enough!

10:01.684 --> 10:05.396
Savior, my ass!
What you are is an angel of death!

10:06.314 --> 10:07.148
Kukuri.

10:07.732 --> 10:12.320
Quinn, Izanami, Kamui, Takeru!
They're all dead because of you!

10:13.154 --> 10:13.988
Be quiet.

10:14.948 --> 10:16.783
I know everything, you hear me?

10:16.866 --> 10:18.785
I know what you're planning to do!

10:19.244 --> 10:21.913
When Regulus finds out, you're history!

10:40.807 --> 10:41.641
She's dead.

11:12.130 --> 11:16.843
I gotta be honest, I'm worried.
Isn't there another way, Eric?

11:17.218 --> 11:20.889
<i>She's a trained member of the RIS.
<i>She'll be fine.</i></i>

11:22.515 --> 11:24.100
-Keith?
<i>-I have no idea.</i>

11:24.684 --> 11:26.436
At least try to comfort me!

11:31.983 --> 11:33.985
Boris! He's made contact.

11:36.029 --> 11:37.906
Eric! We have a nibble!

11:40.199 --> 11:41.284
You commute by bus?

11:41.910 --> 11:45.997
Uh, just for today. My car got totaled.

11:46.456 --> 11:47.332
Totaled?

11:48.458 --> 11:49.959
That's another long story.

11:53.296 --> 11:55.965
If you like,
I can give you a lift. Hop in?

11:56.591 --> 11:57.634
Thank you so much!

12:15.026 --> 12:17.028
They're westbound on route 11.

12:17.278 --> 12:19.948
He actually seems to be
heading towards Lily's.

12:20.448 --> 12:24.452
<i>Roger that. Will confirm.
<i>Maintain pursuit.</i></i>

12:25.495 --> 12:27.664
Gosh, you're a lifesaver!

12:28.206 --> 12:29.832
I mean it, thanks a lot!

12:30.041 --> 12:33.544
My commute home is in the same direction,
so it's no trouble.

12:34.462 --> 12:36.881
My fingers were about to freeze off!

12:36.965 --> 12:38.132
You're exaggerating.

12:38.883 --> 12:41.344
Something keeps bringing us
together today, huh?

12:42.053 --> 12:44.097
Just a happy coincidence, I suppose.

12:46.391 --> 12:50.269
As cold as it is, it might turn to snow
if it starts raining.

12:51.729 --> 12:52.689
Snow, huh?

12:53.606 --> 12:55.441
Does that remind you of something?

12:56.150 --> 12:58.987
When you get to be my age,
lots of things do.

12:59.070 --> 13:00.446
Can I hear about it?

13:00.947 --> 13:02.198
Maybe some other time.

13:02.573 --> 13:06.411
If someone holds back,
I'm the type who starts poking around.

13:06.703 --> 13:07.662
Is that okay?

13:27.098 --> 13:28.349
What's wrong?

13:28.474 --> 13:30.435
I normally wear contacts.

13:30.935 --> 13:33.438
I don't have them in,
so everything's blurry.

13:35.690 --> 13:37.150
Can I turn on the radio?

13:37.650 --> 13:38.484
Sure.

13:48.745 --> 13:49.579
Erika.

13:55.626 --> 13:57.253
I can hear someone humming.

13:58.129 --> 14:01.007
Considering the techno-ish melody,
it must be Lily.

14:01.382 --> 14:02.216
Techno?

14:02.967 --> 14:04.218
Lily loves the stuff.

14:04.385 --> 14:05.386
Hey, she can't--

14:05.928 --> 14:06.846
What's wrong?

14:09.140 --> 14:10.558
It's nothing. Forget it.

14:24.280 --> 14:26.324
You certainly listen to odd music.

14:27.533 --> 14:29.118
This song is really famous!

14:34.791 --> 14:37.335
Erika would never listen to this.

14:52.683 --> 14:55.520
Eric, the target has pulled
into a car wash.

14:55.978 --> 14:56.813
<i>A car wash?</i>

15:27.385 --> 15:29.303
Eric, target is on the move again.

15:43.818 --> 15:47.363
Just to be safe,
close distance and confirm Lily's safety.

15:48.197 --> 15:49.031
Roger that.

15:54.245 --> 15:56.247
Nothing seems out of the ordinary.

16:10.261 --> 16:12.096
Target is pulling into a building!

16:13.014 --> 16:14.557
That's not Lily's house.

16:15.933 --> 16:16.893
It's...

16:17.268 --> 16:18.478
It's Gilbert's house.

16:20.771 --> 16:23.149
Stick with the plan. Continue as normal.

16:25.193 --> 16:26.611
Lily is with him, though.

16:31.616 --> 16:34.160
<i>The car is empty. Lily went inside, too?</i>

16:35.077 --> 16:36.954
She is. She's on the move.

16:39.248 --> 16:42.293
None of the lights are on.
Something's not right.

16:43.002 --> 16:43.836
<i>What do we do?</i>

16:44.462 --> 16:46.464
Lily was humming techno.

16:47.715 --> 16:50.510
After that,
there were no clear messages from her.

16:51.219 --> 16:52.094
Keith?

17:24.335 --> 17:25.169
Clear!

17:35.763 --> 17:36.597
Clear.

18:17.054 --> 18:20.474
Gilbert Ross! Hands behind your head
and get on your knees!

18:23.144 --> 18:24.395
You're late.

18:26.022 --> 18:26.856
Gilbert?

18:28.190 --> 18:30.985
You're late. You're really late.

18:32.486 --> 18:33.779
Who are you?

18:35.281 --> 18:39.577
<i>Eight years. It's been eight years!</i>

18:44.582 --> 18:48.127
-Now we can finally...
-...be set free!

18:57.678 --> 18:58.596
Run, Boris!

18:59.221 --> 19:00.264
<i>Mario! Hurry!</i>

19:12.735 --> 19:15.655
Like the cycle of death and rebirth,
it will repeat itself,

19:16.072 --> 19:17.573
continuing forever!

19:18.574 --> 19:22.119
An indelible code will be etched into you!

19:45.184 --> 19:48.062
All signals have been lost.

19:56.862 --> 19:58.698
<i>Boris, please respond!</i>

19:59.782 --> 20:01.450
<i>Mario! Report status!</i>

20:03.035 --> 20:04.620
<i>Boris! Boris!</i>

20:05.705 --> 20:06.789
<i>Please respond!</i>

20:08.999 --> 20:10.710
<i>Boris! Respond!</i>

20:19.427 --> 20:20.845
<i>Sorry, Eric.</i>

20:21.387 --> 20:22.221
You're okay?

20:24.598 --> 20:25.433
How is Boris?

20:26.058 --> 20:29.770
<i>I'm alive, somehow.
<i>Crap, my ears are ringing!</i></i>

20:30.479 --> 20:31.564
What happened?

20:32.148 --> 20:34.567
<i>It wasn't Gilbert. It was someone else.</i>

20:34.650 --> 20:35.484
What?

20:40.281 --> 20:42.908
He switched places
with a Reggie he had waiting.

20:44.201 --> 20:45.745
These past eight years,

20:45.911 --> 20:49.582
he did this same thing again and again
before committing his crimes.

20:49.915 --> 20:51.834
A Reggie? Where's the real one?

20:57.423 --> 20:58.507
Put out an APB!

20:58.924 --> 21:02.720
"Chance that an investigator
has been abducted. Search area at once."

21:02.803 --> 21:04.889
But our investigation is a secret, so--

21:04.972 --> 21:07.475
-I'll take full responsibility! Do it!
-Wait!

21:08.809 --> 21:11.061
It isn't over yet! We keep going as-is.

21:11.520 --> 21:14.398
-This is an emergency! If we don't do--
-Eric!

21:16.817 --> 21:19.028
Emergencies are part of the process.

21:19.612 --> 21:22.823
In the past, we tried to prevent
emergencies before they happened.

21:23.365 --> 21:26.160
That was our mistake.
That's why we failed.

21:26.911 --> 21:27.745
Keith?

21:28.245 --> 21:31.874
Trouble and unexpected factors
are both inevitable and essential!

21:32.500 --> 21:35.544
They have to be surmounted.
Each one has a purpose.

21:36.086 --> 21:37.755
They always lead to something.

21:38.631 --> 21:39.840
But Lily might be--

21:40.299 --> 21:41.634
I won't let her die.

21:43.427 --> 21:45.262
Please. Have faith in me.

22:35.104 --> 22:36.105
Keith, eh?

22:41.610 --> 22:44.154
Where have you been? I was worried sick,

22:44.655 --> 22:45.489
Erika.

22:47.616 --> 22:49.076
He's caught onto me, huh?

22:49.159 --> 22:52.246
Oh, well, I should have plenty of time
to carve her up.

22:52.997 --> 22:55.708
He won't be able to find this place
for a while.

22:57.376 --> 22:59.503
When Keith shows off that brain of his

22:59.795 --> 23:02.840
and bursts in here
with a triumphant look on his face,

23:03.090 --> 23:07.386
the faint glimmers of hope that had
blossomed inside him will be snuffed out,

23:07.469 --> 23:09.847
and a new despair will take root again.

23:15.394 --> 23:16.770
It's the same color.

23:18.439 --> 23:20.149
The same feel.

25:23.522 --> 25:27.443
