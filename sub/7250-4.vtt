WEBVTT

00:03.086 --> 00:05.005
THE OTHER SIDE OF...

00:05.046 --> 00:07.549
THE OTHER SIDE.

00:05.046 --> 00:07.549
WITH REPUBLICANS?

00:07.591 --> 00:10.010
NO, LATELY, I'VE BEEN HAVING

00:07.591 --> 00:10.010
THESE DARK PREMONITIONS.

00:10.051 --> 00:11.052
OH, ABOUT WHAT?

00:11.094 --> 00:14.055
DEAD COW.

00:14.097 --> 00:16.266
THAT'S<i> WEIRD. </i>

00:14.097 --> 00:16.266
HE'S ALWAYS WEIRD.

00:16.308 --> 00:18.686
NO, I MEAN, MY PREMONITIONS

00:16.308 --> 00:18.686
HAVE BEEN ABOUT DEATH.

00:18.727 --> 00:20.980
ABOUT MY DEATH.

00:18.727 --> 00:20.980
I DON'T WANT

00:18.727 --> 00:20.980
TO HEAR THIS.

00:21.062 --> 00:24.149
AND THE THING IS,

00:21.062 --> 00:24.149
THEY'RE<i> ALL</i> SILLY.

00:21.062 --> 00:24.149
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, SILLY?

00:24.191 --> 00:27.569
IN ONE, I SLIP ON A BANANA

00:24.191 --> 00:27.569
PEEL AND FALL INTO

00:24.191 --> 00:27.569
WHIPPED CREAM.

00:27.611 --> 00:29.989
SILLY AND FATTENING.

00:27.611 --> 00:29.989
IN ANOTHER,

00:27.611 --> 00:29.989
A TURTLE EATS ME.

00:30.030 --> 00:31.323
A TURTLE?

00:30.030 --> 00:31.323
HOW?

00:31.365 --> 00:33.367
VERY SLOWLY.

00:31.365 --> 00:33.367
THERE'S LOTS OF CHEWING.

00:33.408 --> 00:35.118
AND YOU DIDN'T RUN AWAY

00:35.160 --> 00:37.997
FROM WHAT IS PERHAPS THE SLOWEST

00:35.160 --> 00:37.997
LAND ANIMAL ON THE EARTH?

00:38.038 --> 00:40.248
HIS FIRST BITE INJECTS ME WITH

00:38.038 --> 00:40.248
IMMOBILIZING POISON.

00:40.290 --> 00:41.750
YOU LEFT THAT PART OUT.

00:41.792 --> 00:43.961
THIS LAST ONE'S MORE GORY.

00:41.792 --> 00:43.961
I'M OUT HUNTING --

00:44.003 --> 00:45.587
A FAVORITE LORELAI GILMORE

00:44.003 --> 00:45.587
PASTIME.

00:45.629 --> 00:47.088
AND MY SHOTGUN BACKFIRES.

00:47.130 --> 00:49.717
MY WHOLE FACE SPINS AROUND

00:47.130 --> 00:49.717
A BUNCH OF TIMES

00:49.758 --> 00:52.803
AND WINDS UP IN THE BACK

00:49.758 --> 00:52.803
OF MY HEAD LIKE DAFFY DUCK!

00:52.845 --> 00:55.389
NOW, YOU GOTTA PROMISE

00:52.845 --> 00:55.389
TO MOVE MY FACE

00:55.430 --> 00:58.726
BACK TO THE FRONT OF MY HEAD

00:55.430 --> 00:58.726
LIKE DAFFY DID WITH HIS BEAK.

00:58.767 --> 01:00.310
I SHOULD BE WRITING

00:58.767 --> 01:00.310
THIS DOWN.

01:00.352 --> 01:03.772
YOU CAN REMEMBER TO MOVE MY FACE

01:00.352 --> 01:03.772
TO THE FRONT OF MY HEAD.

01:03.814 --> 01:06.025
HELLO, STARS HOLLOW!

01:03.814 --> 01:06.025
ARE YOU READY TO ROCK?

01:06.066 --> 01:07.693
LET ME GUESS --

01:06.066 --> 01:07.693
BAND PRACTICE TONIGHT?

01:07.735 --> 01:10.320
YES, WE'RE GOING TO LEARN OUR

01:07.735 --> 01:10.320
FOURTH SONG.

01:10.362 --> 01:11.864
THAT'S PRACTICALLY A SET.

01:11.906 --> 01:13.240
MMM!

01:11.906 --> 01:13.240
I'M IMPRESSED.

01:13.281 --> 01:15.534
ONCE WE HAVE A SET, WE'LL

01:13.281 --> 01:15.534
GET A GIG,

01:15.576 --> 01:18.370
AND ONCE WE GET A GIG, WE'LL

01:15.576 --> 01:18.370
GET A RECORD DEAL.

01:18.412 --> 01:19.955
AND THEN AFTER THAT,

01:19.997 --> 01:22.499
WE'LL GET REALLY FAMOUS AND GIVE

01:19.997 --> 01:22.499
ALL OF THESE INTERVIEWS

01:22.541 --> 01:26.837
ABOUT HORRIBLE IT IS TO BE

01:22.541 --> 01:26.837
REALLY FAMOUS AND HOW ALL WE

01:22.541 --> 01:26.837
CARE ABOUT IS THE MUSIC,

01:26.879 --> 01:28.630
AND FAME IS GONNA TEAR

01:26.879 --> 01:28.630
US APART.

01:28.672 --> 01:31.050
AND REHEARSING IN THE MUSIC

01:28.672 --> 01:31.050
SHOP'S BEEN WORKING OUT?

01:31.090 --> 01:32.718
IT'S TOTALLY TIME EFFICIENT.

01:32.760 --> 01:35.637
BEING A 30-SECOND COMMUTE,

01:32.760 --> 01:35.637
WE PRACTICE FOR TWO HOURS,

01:35.679 --> 01:39.850
I'M HOME IN TIME TO WATCH

01:35.679 --> 01:39.850
RERUNS OF JOHNNY YUNE'S

01:35.679 --> 01:39.850
TALK SHOW WITH MY MOM,

01:39.892 --> 01:43.938
WHO THINKS I HOOKED UP

01:39.892 --> 01:43.938
WITH YOU GUYS, WHICH I DID,

01:39.892 --> 01:43.938
SO I'M NOT EVEN LYING.

01:43.979 --> 01:47.024
YOU'RE KINDA LYING.

01:43.979 --> 01:47.024
I'M FIBBING,

01:43.979 --> 01:47.024
BUT A FIB IS NOT A LIE.

01:47.066 --> 01:48.400
I'D SAY

01:47.066 --> 01:48.400
IT'S A FIB/LIE.

01:48.442 --> 01:50.694
IT'S NOT A LIE,

01:48.442 --> 01:50.694
AND I CAN ALWAYS TELL

01:50.736 --> 01:52.988
'CAUSE THE FEW TIMES

01:50.736 --> 01:52.988
I'VE LIED TO MY MOTHER,

01:53.030 --> 01:56.825
I GET THIS FEELING IN

01:53.030 --> 01:56.825
MY GUT LIKE A WILD ANIMAL

01:53.030 --> 01:56.825
IS BURROWING INTO IT.

01:56.867 --> 01:58.410
WILD ANIMALS BURROWING

01:56.867 --> 01:58.410
INTO MY STOMACH --

01:58.452 --> 02:00.370
ANOTHER ONE

01:58.452 --> 02:00.370
OF MY PREMONITIONS.

01:58.452 --> 02:00.370
PRETTY SPOOKY.

02:00.412 --> 02:02.748
I'VE GOTTA GO.

02:00.412 --> 02:02.748
I'M SINGLE-HANDEDLY

02:00.412 --> 02:02.748
IMPROVING THE REPUTATION

02:02.790 --> 02:06.334
OF DRUMMERS EVERYWHERE BY BEING

02:02.790 --> 02:06.334
ON TIME FOR EVERY REHEARSAL.

02:02.790 --> 02:06.334
THANKS FOR THE FOOD.

02:06.376 --> 02:09.046
UH, EXCUSE ME.

02:06.376 --> 02:09.046
LANE TOOK MINE.

02:09.088 --> 02:11.423
THIS BAND THING IS NOT

02:09.088 --> 02:11.423
WORKING OUT FOR ME.

02:11.465 --> 02:14.509
LET'S GO.

02:11.465 --> 02:14.509
SEE YA, LUKE.

02:14.551 --> 02:16.219
SEE YA.

02:16.261 --> 02:19.180

SOMETHING'S MISSING.

04:01.324 --> 04:02.951
YEAH -- VOLUME.

04:02.993 --> 04:05.412
WE CAN'T PLAY ANY LOUDER.

04:02.993 --> 04:05.412
THAT'S THE AGREEMENT.

04:05.453 --> 04:07.706
FREE PRACTICE SPACE, BUT WE

04:05.453 --> 04:07.706
HAVE TO PLAY QUIETLY.

04:07.748 --> 04:09.290
TRY AND LIVE WITH IT,

04:07.748 --> 04:09.290
ZACK.

04:09.332 --> 04:11.376
DUDE, BRIAN'S BREATHING IS

04:09.332 --> 04:11.376
LOUDER THAN THE SONG.

04:11.418 --> 04:12.836
I'VE GOT A DEVIATED SEPTUM.

04:12.878 --> 04:15.380
ALL THE WOMEN IN MY

04:12.878 --> 04:15.380
FAMILY AND ME HAVE IT.

04:15.422 --> 04:16.840
WELL, IT'S THROWING ME OFF.

04:16.882 --> 04:18.759
HOLD YOUR BREATH, BRIAN.

04:16.882 --> 04:18.759
THERE, PROBLEM SOLVED.

04:18.800 --> 04:21.636
OKAY, COME ON, NOW, LET'S ROCK.

04:18.800 --> 04:21.636
ONE, TWO, THREE --

04:21.678 --> 04:23.513
WAIT.

04:21.678 --> 04:23.513
THE BOTTOM LINE HERE

04:23.555 --> 04:26.266
IS BREATHING SHOULD NOT BE

04:23.555 --> 04:26.266
LOUDER THAN A ROCK BAND.

04:26.307 --> 04:28.102
AM I RIGHT OR AM I RIGHT?

04:28.143 --> 04:30.687
RYGALSKI, WE NEED TO

04:28.143 --> 04:30.687
CRANK IT UP.

04:30.729 --> 04:32.814
JUST LISTEN HARDER.

04:30.729 --> 04:32.814
THAT'LL MAKE IT SOUND LOUDER.

04:32.856 --> 04:34.649
CAN'T WE TURN IT

04:32.856 --> 04:34.649
UP AT ALL?

04:34.691 --> 04:37.986
WELL, WE COULD POSSIBLY TURN

04:34.691 --> 04:37.986
THE AMPS UP FROM 3 TO 3 1/2,

04:38.028 --> 04:39.780
BUT THAT'S IT.

04:38.028 --> 04:39.780
FORGET IT.

04:39.821 --> 04:41.448
ZACK,

04:39.821 --> 04:41.448
WE JUST GOT STARTED.

04:41.489 --> 04:43.533
DUDE, LAWRENCE WELK CRANKED

04:41.489 --> 04:43.533
LOUDER THAN THIS.

04:43.575 --> 04:44.993
IT'S A WASTE OF TIME.

04:45.035 --> 04:47.412
WAIT, ZACK, NO, YOU DON'T

04:45.035 --> 04:47.412
UNDERSTAND.

04:47.454 --> 04:50.331
WE CAN'T PLAY LOUDER.

04:47.454 --> 04:50.331
MY MOM HAS THIS

04:47.454 --> 04:50.331
SPECIAL ANTENNA

04:50.373 --> 04:53.710
THAT CAN PICK UP NON-CHRISTIAN

04:50.373 --> 04:53.710
MUSIC BEING PLAYED, WITHIN A

04:50.373 --> 04:53.710
FOOTBALL FIELDS DISTANCE

04:53.752 --> 04:55.545
AND SHE'D IMMEDIATELY COME

04:53.752 --> 04:55.545
LOOKING FOR ME

04:55.587 --> 04:57.589
IN ORDER TO SHIELD ME

04:55.587 --> 04:57.589
FROM THE PERVERSION.

04:57.631 --> 04:59.007
IF ZACK'S GOING,

04:57.631 --> 04:59.007
I'M GOING.

04:59.049 --> 05:01.468
NO, BRIAN,

04:59.049 --> 05:01.468
I'M NOT EXAGGERATING!

05:01.509 --> 05:03.595
ONCE, A GUY IN OUR TOWN

05:01.509 --> 05:03.595
NAMED KIRK

05:03.637 --> 05:05.513
WAS PRACTICING

05:03.637 --> 05:05.513
"BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY,"

05:03.637 --> 05:05.513
WITH HIS BAND

05:05.555 --> 05:07.724
AND MY MOM SHUT THEM DOWN

05:05.555 --> 05:07.724
SO FAST

05:07.766 --> 05:10.060
THAT THE BAND FLED WITHOUT

05:07.766 --> 05:10.060
THEIR INSTRUMENTS.

05:10.102 --> 05:12.938
TO THIS DAY, KIRK CAN'T LISTEN

05:10.102 --> 05:12.938
TO QUEEN WITHOUT TEARING UP.

05:12.980 --> 05:15.607
HAVING A FREE PRACTICE

05:12.980 --> 05:15.607
SPACE WAS COOL AND ALL,

05:15.649 --> 05:17.025
BUT NOT LIKE THIS.

05:17.067 --> 05:19.236
WE SHOULD JUST RENT A SPACE

05:17.067 --> 05:19.236
IN HARTFORD.

05:19.278 --> 05:21.071
HARTFORD.

05:19.278 --> 05:21.071
CONNECTICUT?

05:21.113 --> 05:22.990
IT'S NOT THAT FAR.

05:23.031 --> 05:25.533
OR MAYBE HOW ABOUT FRANCE?

05:23.031 --> 05:25.533
WE COULD PRACTICE IN FRANCE.

05:25.575 --> 05:27.410
OR ICELAND!

05:25.575 --> 05:27.410
THE MOON'S PROBABLY AVAILABLE!

05:27.452 --> 05:29.704
WE COULD CRANK IT WAY

05:27.452 --> 05:29.704
UP ON THE MOON!

05:29.746 --> 05:31.248
A WORD, PLEASE?

05:31.290 --> 05:34.126
DAVE, TALK TO THEM!

05:31.290 --> 05:34.126
YOU'RE THE LEADER!

05:34.168 --> 05:36.128
THAT'S INSUBORDINATION

05:34.168 --> 05:36.128
GOING ON IN THERE!

05:36.170 --> 05:38.839
THEY SHOULD BE FLOGGED, STRUNG

05:36.170 --> 05:38.839
UP FROM THE HIGHEST YARDARM!

05:38.880 --> 05:40.339
NO, I CAN'T.

05:38.880 --> 05:40.339
WHY?

05:40.381 --> 05:42.383
BECAUSE WE'RE SUPPOSED

05:40.381 --> 05:42.383
TO BE A ONE-FOR-ALL BAND.

05:42.425 --> 05:44.469
LIKE THE CLASH OR U2.

05:42.425 --> 05:44.469
IT'S A DEMOCRACY.

05:44.511 --> 05:47.014
DEMOCRACIES ARE OVERRATED. GET

05:44.511 --> 05:47.014
IN THERE AND KICK SOME BUTTS!

05:47.055 --> 05:48.807
I'LL FIX BRIAN'S DEVIATED

05:47.055 --> 05:48.807
SEPTUM.

05:48.849 --> 05:51.101
I'LL RAM ONE OF MY STICKS

05:48.849 --> 05:51.101
UP HIS NOSE!

05:51.143 --> 05:53.103
DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE

05:51.143 --> 05:53.103
THIS IS WORKING?

05:53.145 --> 05:56.023
NO, IT'S NOT WORKING.

05:53.145 --> 05:56.023
WE SOUND LIKE A BUNCH OF

05:53.145 --> 05:56.023
WANKERS.

05:56.064 --> 05:58.483
WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO

05:56.064 --> 05:58.483
REALLY PLAY.

05:58.525 --> 06:01.278
WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO BE ABLE TO

05:58.525 --> 06:01.278
HIT BOTH THE CYMBALS?

06:01.320 --> 06:02.863
THEN WE NEED TO DO THIS.

06:02.904 --> 06:05.032
I JUST DON'T WANT TO

06:02.904 --> 06:05.032
LEAVE THE BAND.

06:05.073 --> 06:06.574
WHAT?

06:05.073 --> 06:06.574
YOU CAN'T LEAVE THE BAND.

06:06.616 --> 06:08.660
THAT'S NOT WHAT ANYBODY WANTS,

06:06.616 --> 06:08.660
ESPECIALLY ME.

06:08.702 --> 06:10.662
LANE, YOU'RE PERFECT FOR US.

06:08.702 --> 06:10.662
IT'S WORKING.

06:10.704 --> 06:12.956
SO I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT

06:10.704 --> 06:12.956
A WAY

06:12.998 --> 06:15.709
TO REHEARSE IN HARTFORD

06:12.998 --> 06:15.709
TWO OR THREE NIGHTS A WEEK.

06:15.750 --> 06:17.376
THAT'S NOT SO TOUGH.

06:17.418 --> 06:21.173
NO, AND MAYBE AT THE SAME TIME,

06:17.418 --> 06:21.173
I'LL MASTER QUANTUM PHYSICS,

06:21.215 --> 06:22.716
AND THROW SANSKRIT IN

06:21.215 --> 06:22.716
THERE, TOO.

06:22.757 --> 06:24.759
DO YOUR BEST --

06:22.757 --> 06:24.759
NOT WITH THE SANSKRIT THING,

06:24.801 --> 06:25.927
BUT WITH THE BAND.

06:25.969 --> 06:27.470
I'LL TRY.

06:27.512 --> 06:29.764
THERE'S NO WAY YOU'RE GONNA

06:27.512 --> 06:29.764
BECOME OUR PETE BEST.

06:29.806 --> 06:31.058
THERE'S NO WAY.

06:31.099 --> 06:32.559
YOU'RE SWEET.

06:32.600 --> 06:34.228
WE SHOULD GET BACK

06:32.600 --> 06:34.228
IN THERE.

06:34.269 --> 06:36.479
OKAY, UM, I'LL BE IN

06:34.269 --> 06:36.479
IN A MINUTE.

06:43.444 --> 06:45.613
WRACK YOUR BRAINS.

06:43.444 --> 06:45.613
WE'VE REALLY GOTTA THINK HERE.

06:45.655 --> 06:47.115
IT'S QUITE A PICKLE.

06:47.157 --> 06:49.659
NO, RORY, THIS IS MUCH BIGGER

06:47.157 --> 06:49.659
THAN A PICKLE.

06:49.701 --> 06:51.536
OKAY, LET'S STOP SAYING

06:49.701 --> 06:51.536
THE WORD "PICKLE."

06:51.578 --> 06:55.249
HOW MANY NIGHTS A WEEK WOULD YOU

06:51.578 --> 06:55.249
HAVE TO GO TO HARTFORD

06:51.578 --> 06:55.249
TO PRACTICE?

06:55.290 --> 06:57.125
TWO PLUS A WEEKEND

06:55.290 --> 06:57.125
AFTERNOON.

06:57.167 --> 07:00.212
SO THAT'S THREE BIG BLOCKS OF

06:57.167 --> 07:00.212
TIME YOU'D HAVE TO ACCOUNT FOR.

07:00.254 --> 07:03.757
PLUS YOU HAVE NO CAR TO

07:00.254 --> 07:03.757
TRANSPORT YOUR DRUMS

07:00.254 --> 07:03.757
ANYWHERE AS OF YET.

07:03.798 --> 07:06.551
OR A DRIVER'S LICENSE.

07:03.798 --> 07:06.551
OR ANY DRUMS BECAUSE YOU'RE

07:03.798 --> 07:06.551
BORROWING THEM.

07:06.593 --> 07:09.012
TEMPORARILY UNTIL

07:06.593 --> 07:09.012
I CAN BUY MY OWN SET

07:09.054 --> 07:11.598
WITH MONEY THAT I DON'T KNOW

07:09.054 --> 07:11.598
WHERE I'M GONNA GET.

07:11.639 --> 07:14.768
THAT'S MORE THAN A PICKLE.

07:11.639 --> 07:14.768
YOU'RE MAKING LIGHT.

07:11.639 --> 07:14.768
NOW STOP AND FOCUS.

07:14.809 --> 07:17.104
AND TURN DOWN THE CORNERSHOP.

07:14.809 --> 07:17.104
IT'S DISTRACTING.

07:17.145 --> 07:19.439
NO, YOUR COLTRANE IS

07:17.145 --> 07:19.439
DISTRACTING.

07:17.145 --> 07:19.439
TURN<i> THAT</i> DOWN.

07:19.480 --> 07:23.277
I'M IN ANGST HERE, AND

07:19.480 --> 07:23.277
COLTRANE SPEAKS TO MY SOUL.

07:19.480 --> 07:23.277
I CAN TURN IT DOWN.

07:23.318 --> 07:26.487
FINE, IN DEFERENCE TO YOUR SOUL,

07:23.318 --> 07:26.487
I'LL TURN MINE DOWN.

07:26.529 --> 07:28.115
HEY, HERE'S A CRAZY

07:26.529 --> 07:28.115
THOUGHT --

07:28.156 --> 07:30.242
HOW ABOUT YOU TELL YOUR

07:28.156 --> 07:30.242
MOM THE TRUTH

07:30.284 --> 07:32.786
AND INSIST THAT SHE LET YOU

07:30.284 --> 07:32.786
PLAY WITH THE BAND

07:32.827 --> 07:34.329
AND REHEARSE IN STARS HOLLOW

07:32.827 --> 07:34.329
LOUDLY

07:34.371 --> 07:36.456
AS LONG AS YOUR SCHOOLWORK

07:34.371 --> 07:36.456
DOESN'T SUFFER?

07:36.497 --> 07:39.542
I'M SORRY, WAS THAT

07:36.497 --> 07:39.542
A SERIOUS SUGGESTION?

07:36.497 --> 07:39.542
HEY, IT'S WORTH A SHOT.

07:39.584 --> 07:43.630
NO, YOU'RE THINKING<i> YOUR</i> MOM.

07:39.584 --> 07:43.630
IF I SAID THAT, SHE'D START

07:39.584 --> 07:43.630
WAVING A CRUCIFIX AT ME.

07:43.671 --> 07:44.756
IF SHE SAYS NO,

07:43.671 --> 07:44.756
SHE SAYS NO,

07:44.798 --> 07:46.216
BUT RIGHT NOW, YOU'RE OUT

07:44.798 --> 07:46.216
OF OPTIONS.

07:46.258 --> 07:48.260
WE HAVE ANOTHER CALL.

07:46.258 --> 07:48.260

07:48.302 --> 07:50.762
OKAY, I WILL, AND, HEY,

08:52.699 --> 08:55.494
ANOTHER WAY TO DESCRIBE HER.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.329
YOU HAVE NO MEMORY OF

08:55.535 --> 08:57.329
THIS WOMAN?

17:25.586 --> 17:27.755
WHAT ABOUT BLUE?

17:27.797 --> 17:30.717

YOU NEED SOMETHING?

18:02.957 --> 18:06.002
NO.

18:02.957 --> 18:06.002
NO, I JUST, UM...

18:06.044 --> 18:09.129
I WAS WONDERING IF THERE'S A

18:09.171 --> 18:12.174

DID YOU LOSE TRACK OF TIME?

18:36.198 --> 18:39.619
WHAT? WHY?

18:36.198 --> 18:39.619
IT'S 4:00. WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE

18:36.198 --> 18:39.619
AT SCHOOL, LIKE, NOW.

18:39.660 --> 18:41.287

18:49.003 --> 18:51.547
THE GRUNGE LOOK IS OUT.

18:51.589 --> 18:54.425
HEY, I'M NOT DRESSING UP

18:51.589 --> 18:54.425
FOR THIS.

18:51.589 --> 18:54.425
YOU NEED SOMETHING BETTER.

18:54.467 --> 18:56.469
THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS STUPID

18:54.467 --> 18:56.469
CLASS TALK

18:56.510 --> 18:59.305
WAS FOR US TO TALK ABOUT OUR

18:59.346 --> 19:01.348
THIS FLANNEL SHIRT IS MY MOST

18:59.346 --> 19:01.348

I'LL BUY YOU A TOY AFTERWARD.

19:11.400 --> 19:14.821
YOU WANT A TOY?

19:14.862 --> 19:16.864

19:14.862 --> 19:16.864

WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT

19:16.906 --> 19:18.825
A TOY?

19:18.866 --> 19:21.119
LUKE IS GETTING ONE IF

19:18.866 --> 19:21.119

19:21.160 --> 19:22.954
CAN WE MAKE THIS MORE

19:21.160 --> 19:22.954
DEMEANING?

19:22.996 --> 19:25.665

19:33.798 --> 19:36.134

19:36.175 --> 19:38.803
A FEW SHOWS? OH, MY GOD,

19:36.175 --> 19:38.803
YOU'RE A BUFFETT HEAD.

19:38.845 --> 19:41.139

19:41.180 --> 19:42.431
SING "MARGARITAVILLE."

19:41.180 --> 19:42.431
NO.

19:45.143 --> 19:46.393
WE'VE GOT OURSELVES A

19:45.143 --> 19:46.393

19:46.435 --> 19:47.979
FINE, FINE.

19:49.313 --> 19:50.940
I'LL BE MORE COMFORTABLE

19:49.313 --> 19:50.940
IN HERE.

19:50.982 --> 19:52.733
I'VE SEEN YOU SWIMMING

19:50.982 --> 19:52.733
AT THE LAKE,

19:52.775 --> 19:54.861
SO I'VE SEEN YOU WITH

19:52.775 --> 19:54.861
YOUR SHIRT OFF!

19:54.902 --> 19:56.779
LATELY? 'CAUSE HE'S REALLY

19:54.902 --> 19:56.779
LET HIMSELF GO.

19:56.821 --> 19:58.990
LOSE THE BASEBALL CAP,

19:56.821 --> 19:58.990
TOO.

19:59.032 --> 20:01.784
YOU RUN THE RISK OF HIS HEAD

19:59.032 --> 20:01.784
FALLING OFF WITHOUT IT.

20:01.826 --> 20:03.036
I THINK HE'LL BE OKAY.

20:10.751 --> 20:11.752
SOMETHING WRONG?

20:11.794 --> 20:12.837
UH, NO.

20:12.879 --> 20:14.964
NO, I JUST --

20:15.006 --> 20:16.423
NO.

20:16.465 --> 20:17.967
HAPPY?

20:18.009 --> 20:20.260
THRILLED. A TIE WITH

20:18.009 --> 20:20.260
THAT WOULD BE JUST GREAT.

20:20.302 --> 20:23.389
WE'RE LEAVING. IT'S GOTTA

20:20.302 --> 20:23.389
BE SOMETHING I DON'T

20:20.302 --> 20:23.389
HAVE TO PUT TOGETHER.

20:23.430 --> 20:24.932
WHAT?

20:23.430 --> 20:24.932
MY TOY.

20:24.974 --> 20:28.394
TALK GOOD.

20:24.974 --> 20:28.394
WOW, WE'RE LATE.

20:28.435 --> 20:31.230
OH, BY THE WAY,

20:28.435 --> 20:31.230
JESS HAD A GIRL

20:28.435 --> 20:31.230
IN THE CLOSET.

20:31.271 --> 20:32.690
WHAT?

20:31.271 --> 20:32.690
COME ON.

20:31.271 --> 20:32.690
PIP PIP.

20:32.732 --> 20:35.776
WHO? WHAT WAS THAT?

20:32.732 --> 20:35.776
WHAT ABOUT THE CLOSET?

20:39.030 --> 20:41.949
OKAY -- COMBS, RAGS,

20:39.030 --> 20:41.949
INSTRUCTIONS,

20:39.030 --> 20:41.949
TIMER, TOWELS, TUNES.

20:41.991 --> 20:44.827
ALL SYSTEMS ARE GO.

20:41.991 --> 20:44.827
NOW, ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?

20:44.869 --> 20:47.747
WILL YOU STOP?

20:44.869 --> 20:47.747
I'LL SIGN A WAIVER IF YOU WANT.

20:47.788 --> 20:49.832
HIT PLAY, PLEASE.

20:49.874 --> 20:51.625
WE SHOULD OPEN A WINDOW,

20:49.874 --> 20:51.625
SHOULDN'T WE?

20:51.667 --> 20:53.044
IT'S FREEZING OUTSIDE.

20:53.086 --> 20:55.337
THE BLEACH IS GONNA STINK UP THE

20:53.086 --> 20:55.337
WHOLE HOUSE.

20:55.379 --> 20:59.175
LET IT BE THE FIRST CLUE THAT

20:55.379 --> 20:59.175
SOMETHING'S HAPPENED

20:55.379 --> 20:59.175
FOR WHEN MY MOM GETS HOME.

20:59.217 --> 21:01.969
LET THE THICK SMELL OF BLEACH

20:59.217 --> 21:01.969
MEET HER AT THE DOORWAY

21:02.011 --> 21:03.512
LIKE A FORCE THAT'LL

21:02.011 --> 21:03.512
USHER HER

21:03.554 --> 21:05.639
INTO THE NEXT CHAPTER OF

21:03.554 --> 21:05.639
LANE KIM'S LIFE!

21:05.681 --> 21:08.101
THE SMELL OF BLEACH IS

21:05.681 --> 21:08.101
THE SMELL OF FREEDOM!

21:08.142 --> 21:09.727
YOU'RE VERY DRAMATIC TODAY.

21:09.769 --> 21:12.897
TO HELL WITH THE FLOOR!

21:09.769 --> 21:12.897
OH, THAT FELT GOOD TO SAY.

21:12.939 --> 21:15.482

21:12.939 --> 21:15.482
TAKE YOUR SEAT, PLEASE.

21:15.524 --> 21:19.737
AND HERE WE GO.

21:19.779 --> 21:20.988
HOW YOU DOING?

21:21.030 --> 21:22.073
FINE.

21:22.115 --> 21:23.449
FEELING GOOD?

21:23.490 --> 21:25.409
FEELING GREAT.

21:23.490 --> 21:25.409
THIS IS SUCH A CATHARSIS.

21:25.451 --> 21:28.579
I HAVE NEVER FELT SO NATURALLY

21:25.451 --> 21:28.579
HIGH IN MY LIFE.

21:28.621 --> 21:30.957
STINGS A LITTLE, THOUGH.

21:28.621 --> 21:30.957
YEAH, THAT HAPPENS.

21:30.998 --> 21:33.333
BUT JUST A LITTLE.

21:30.998 --> 21:33.333
NO BIGGIE.

21:33.375 --> 21:36.170
MORE THAN A LITTLE, ACTUALLY.

21:33.375 --> 21:36.170
IT'S KIND OF A BIG LITTLE.

21:36.212 --> 21:39.257
JUST KEEP ME POSTED.

21:36.212 --> 21:39.257
IN THAT CASE,

21:36.212 --> 21:39.257
IT'S KIND OF A LOT.

21:39.298 --> 21:41.550
YEP, YEP, A LOT OF STING

21:39.298 --> 21:41.550
HAPPENING HERE.

21:41.592 --> 21:43.385
TRY THINKING ABOUT SOMETHING

21:41.592 --> 21:43.385
ELSE.

21:43.427 --> 21:45.096
GOD, THIS SMELLS AWFUL.

21:45.138 --> 21:46.680
OKAY, THINKING ABOUT

21:45.138 --> 21:46.680
SOMETHING ELSE.

21:46.722 --> 21:49.600
SOMETHING ELSE.

21:46.722 --> 21:49.600
THINKING ABOUT PUPPY DOGS.

21:49.642 --> 21:51.393
THINKING ABOUT GETTING THINGS

21:49.642 --> 21:51.393
IN THE MAIL --

21:51.435 --> 21:53.980
I LOVE GETTING THINGS IN A MAIL.

21:51.435 --> 21:53.980
LETTERS AND PACKAGES.

21:54.021 --> 21:55.522
GOT A PACKAGE!

21:54.021 --> 21:55.522
WHAT'S THAT?

21:55.564 --> 21:57.357
JIM CAREY SAYS THAT IN

21:55.564 --> 21:57.357
"ACE VENTURA."

21:57.399 --> 22:01.070
THINKING ABOUT WORLD EVENTS.

21:57.399 --> 22:01.070
LOTS GOING ON THERE.

22:01.112 --> 22:03.156
THINKING ABOUT THE LAST

22:01.112 --> 22:03.156
MOVIE I SAW.

22:03.197 --> 22:04.824
VIN DIESEL WAS IN IT.

22:04.865 --> 22:08.161
THINKING ABOUT WHERE VIN DIESEL

22:04.865 --> 22:08.161
GOT THE NAME VIN DIESEL.

22:08.202 --> 22:10.412
THINKING ABOUT VIN DIESEL'S

22:08.202 --> 22:10.412
MYSTERIOUS ETHNICITY.

22:10.454 --> 22:11.998
THINKING ABOUT HOW SURPRISING

22:10.454 --> 22:11.998
IT IS

22:12.039 --> 22:14.541
TO HAVE SO MUCH TO THINK

22:12.039 --> 22:14.541
ABOUT WITH VIN DIESEL.

22:14.583 --> 22:16.794
OKAY, NOW I'M JUST THINKING

22:14.583 --> 22:16.794
ABOUT THE PAIN.

22:16.836 --> 22:18.587
BACK TO VIN DIESEL.

22:18.629 --> 22:21.215
I'VE EXHAUSTED VIN DIESEL, BUT

22:18.629 --> 22:21.215
THE PAIN, THAT'S NOT EXHAUSTED.

22:21.257 --> 22:24.010
EVER LIGHT YOUR HEAD ON FIRE?

22:21.257 --> 22:24.010
I KNOW HOW IT FEELS.

22:24.051 --> 22:25.303
I'LL RINSE IT OUT.

22:25.343 --> 22:27.221
WE'D HAVE TO START ALL

22:25.343 --> 22:27.221
OVER AGAIN,

22:27.263 --> 22:28.806
AND I'LL CHICKEN OUT

22:27.263 --> 22:28.806
FOR SURE!

22:28.848 --> 22:30.432
I'M GETTING DIZZY FROM

22:28.848 --> 22:30.432
THE SMELL.

22:30.474 --> 22:31.767
READ THE BOTTLE.

22:31.809 --> 22:34.103
TELL ME WHAT TO DO IN

22:31.809 --> 22:34.103
CASE OF PAIN!

22:34.145 --> 22:35.855
UM, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

22:35.896 --> 22:38.649
"DO NOT APPLY TO A BROKEN

22:35.896 --> 22:38.649
SCALP." IS YOUR SCALP BROKEN?

22:38.691 --> 22:40.484
I DON'T KNOW MY SCALP

22:38.691 --> 22:40.484
THAT WELL.

22:40.526 --> 22:42.360
THERE'S NOTHING ELSE

22:40.526 --> 22:42.360
ABOUT PAIN.

22:42.402 --> 22:46.240
A GIRL TOLD ME ONCE IF YOUR

22:42.402 --> 22:46.240
SCALP IS HURTING, DRINK A 7 UP.

22:46.282 --> 22:48.326
THE KIM HOUSEHOLD DOES NOT

22:46.282 --> 22:48.326
HAVE SOFT DRINKS!

22:48.366 --> 22:50.410
WHAT DO YOU GOT?

22:48.366 --> 22:50.410
SOMETHING CALLED

22:48.366 --> 22:50.410
SALAD WATER.

22:50.452 --> 22:52.412
BELIEVE ME,

22:50.452 --> 22:52.412
IT'S NOTHING LIKE 7 UP!

22:52.454 --> 22:54.123
WE HAVE TO OPEN

22:52.454 --> 22:54.123
THIS WINDOW.

22:54.165 --> 22:56.709
I HAVE GOT TO DO

22:54.165 --> 22:56.709
SOMETHING!

22:54.165 --> 22:56.709
RUN AROUND THE BLOCK!

22:56.750 --> 22:58.127
GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME!

23:00.880 --> 23:03.381
IT'S SO GOOD OF YOU BOTH TO DO

23:00.880 --> 23:03.381
THIS, REALLY.

23:03.423 --> 23:05.009
WE'RE HAPPY TO BE HERE.

23:03.423 --> 23:05.009
RIGHT?

ELSEWHERE.

34:21.518 --> 34:24.604
USUALLY, I LIKE TO MEET UP AT

34:21.518 --> 34:24.604
SARDI'S AFTER A PERFORMANCE.

34:24.646 --> 34:27.315
WAIT FOR THE REVIEWS.

34:24.646 --> 34:27.315
I HOPE THE<i> TIMES</i> LIKED ME.

34:27.357 --> 34:29.568
HUH! NOTHING, HUH?

34:29.609 --> 34:31.236
SO YOU'RE PREACHING TO

34:29.609 --> 34:31.236
OUR DAUGHTERS

34:31.277 --> 34:33.321
THAT IT'S OKAY TO GET

34:31.277 --> 34:33.321
PREGNANT AT 16.

34:33.363 --> 34:34.740
AM I GETTING THAT RIGHT?

34:34.781 --> 34:37.200
NO, NOT AT ALL.

34:34.781 --> 34:37.200
I WAS ANSWERING THEIR QUESTIONS.

34:37.242 --> 34:38.785
IT'S YOUR ANSWERS WE

34:37.242 --> 34:38.785
DIDN'T LIKE.

34:38.827 --> 34:40.871
I WAS TALKING ABOUT

34:38.827 --> 34:40.871
MY JOB

34:40.913 --> 34:44.457
BUT YOUR KIDS KEPT ASKING

34:40.913 --> 34:44.457
ABOUT MY PREGNANCY.

34:40.913 --> 34:44.457
WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO?

34:44.499 --> 34:46.167
FEND THEM OFF!

34:44.499 --> 34:46.167
CHANGE THE SUBJECT!

34:46.209 --> 34:49.629
THEY KEPT COMING AT ME LIKE I

34:46.209 --> 34:49.629
WAS POLAND AND THEY WERE NAZIS.

34:49.671 --> 34:52.716
REMEMBER THE OLD DAYS, GIRLS,

34:49.671 --> 34:52.716
WHEN I USED TO MAKE YOU LAUGH?

34:52.758 --> 34:54.175
THERE'S NOTHING FUNNY

34:52.758 --> 34:54.175
ABOUT THIS.

34:54.217 --> 34:56.219
THEIR QUESTIONS

34:54.217 --> 34:56.219
JUST THREW ME OFF, THAT'S ALL.

34:56.261 --> 34:58.013
SOUNDS LIKE YOU JUST FLAUNTED

34:56.261 --> 34:58.013
YOUR MISTAKES.

34:58.055 --> 35:00.724
NOW, HOLD ON.

34:58.055 --> 35:00.724
YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO JUDGE ME.

35:00.766 --> 35:04.185
ALL I SAID WAS THAT FOR MY

35:00.766 --> 35:04.185
PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES,

35:00.766 --> 35:04.185
THINGS WORKED OUT OKAY.

35:04.227 --> 35:07.689
I ADVOCATED NOTHING.

35:04.227 --> 35:07.689
YOU'RE ALL ACTING LIKE

35:04.227 --> 35:07.689
I WALKED INTO THAT ROOM

35:07.731 --> 35:08.982
TOSSING CONDOMS IN THE AIR.

35:09.024 --> 35:10.358
YOU MIGHT AS WELL HAVE.

35:10.400 --> 35:12.193
FINE, NEXT TIME,

35:10.400 --> 35:12.193
I'LL BRING A BANANA,

35:12.235 --> 35:14.988
AND WE'LL HAVE A LITTLE

35:12.235 --> 35:14.988
SHOW AND TELL!

35:12.235 --> 35:14.988
HOW ABOUT THAT?

35:15.030 --> 35:16.573
WHAT KIND OF MOTHER

35:15.030 --> 35:16.573
ARE YOU?

35:16.615 --> 35:18.366
THE KIND THAT DOESN'T GLOSS

35:16.615 --> 35:18.366
OVER THINGS

35:18.408 --> 35:20.243
JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE A LITTLE

35:18.408 --> 35:20.243
UNCOMFORTABLE.

35:20.285 --> 35:23.455
THIS WHOLE INCIDENT WAS

35:20.285 --> 35:23.455
AWKWARD AND UNNECESSARY.

35:23.496 --> 35:27.125
NO, DEB, I'D SAY, DEB, THAT

35:23.496 --> 35:27.125
WHAT'S AWKWARD AND UNNECESSARY,

35:27.166 --> 35:30.629
DEB, IS THAT YOU ALL SEEM TO GO

35:27.166 --> 35:30.629
TO THE SAME LOUSY HAIRDRESSER.

35:30.670 --> 35:32.965
HOW ABOUT MIXING IT UP

35:30.670 --> 35:32.965
A LITTLE, HUH, GIRLS?

35:33.006 --> 35:35.759
I GOTTA GET GOING.

35:33.006 --> 35:35.759
YOU GOOD HERE?

35:33.006 --> 35:35.759
YEAH, YEAH, I'M GOOD.

35:35.801 --> 35:37.469
DON'T TAKE THAT TONE.

35:37.510 --> 35:40.889
YOU AMBUSH ME, THEN YOU'RE

35:37.510 --> 35:40.889
OFFENDED BY<i> MY</i> TONE?

35:40.931 --> 35:42.348
HEY.

35:42.390 --> 35:45.477
SO WHAT'S GOING ON OUT

35:42.390 --> 35:45.477
THERE?

35:45.518 --> 35:49.022
OH, JUST LORELAI DEALING

35:45.518 --> 35:49.022
WITH SOME WOMEN

35:49.064 --> 35:51.691
ABOUT SOMETHING

35:49.064 --> 35:51.691
OR OTHER.

35:51.733 --> 35:54.027
SO I DID THAT THING AT THE

35:51.733 --> 35:54.027
SCHOOL TODAY.

35:54.069 --> 35:56.362
YEAH,

35:54.069 --> 35:56.362
IT WENT PRETTY WELL.

35:56.404 --> 35:58.991
ALL THE KIDS SEEMED

35:56.404 --> 35:58.991
RELATIVELY UNARMED.

36:02.828 --> 36:05.371
I JUST TOLD 'EM ABOUT THE DINER

36:02.828 --> 36:05.371
AND COOKING THINGS,

36:05.413 --> 36:09.584
AND I EXPECT KIDS ALL OVER TOWN

36:05.413 --> 36:09.584
WILL RUSH OUT TOMORROW

36:09.626 --> 36:10.794
AND BUY A SPATULA.

36:10.836 --> 36:12.545
CHECKING FOR MONSTERS?

36:12.587 --> 36:15.715
NO, JUST DIDN'T WANT TO

36:12.587 --> 36:15.715
ACCIDENTALLY BUMP INTO SOMEONE.

36:15.757 --> 36:17.342
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING

36:15.757 --> 36:17.342
ABOUT?

36:17.383 --> 36:19.970
JESS, DID YOU HAVE A GIRL

36:17.383 --> 36:19.970
STASHED IN THERE BEFORE?

36:20.012 --> 36:22.180
LORELAI SAID YOU WERE HIDING

36:20.012 --> 36:22.180
SOMEONE HERE EARLIER.

36:22.221 --> 36:24.390
WERE YOU?

36:22.221 --> 36:24.390
YES.

36:24.432 --> 36:26.685
JESS, YOU DON'T SHOVE A GIRL

36:24.432 --> 36:26.685
IN A CLOSET.

36:26.726 --> 36:29.771
I DID NOT SHOVE

36:26.726 --> 36:29.771
HER IN THE CLOSET.

36:26.726 --> 36:29.771
SHE GOT IN VOLUNTARILY.

36:29.813 --> 36:31.356
OH, SURE.

36:31.397 --> 36:34.359
SHANE FREAKED, NEXT THING I

36:31.397 --> 36:34.359
KNOW SHE'S IN THERE.

36:34.400 --> 36:37.154
I PERSONALLY DIDN'T CARE IF YOU

36:34.400 --> 36:37.154
GUYS SAW US OR NOT.

36:37.195 --> 36:40.239
BUT, HEY, WOMEN, RIGHT?

36:37.195 --> 36:40.239
YOU CAN'T LIVE WITH 'EM.

36:40.281 --> 36:42.575
YOU CAN'T KEEP 'EM FROM JUMPING

36:40.281 --> 36:42.575
IN THE CLOSET.

36:42.617 --> 36:45.912
YOU AND I HAVE GOT TO HAVE A

36:42.617 --> 36:45.912
LITTLE TALK.

36:45.954 --> 36:48.623
HEY, IF YOU'RE GONNA GET ALL

36:45.954 --> 36:48.623
WARD CLEAVER ON ME,

36:48.665 --> 36:52.251
I GOTTA GO CALL EDDIE AND LUMPY

36:48.665 --> 36:52.251
AND TELL 'EM I'M GONNA BE LATE.

36:52.293 --> 36:54.129
SHUT UP FOR A SECOND,

36:52.293 --> 36:54.129
WOULD YA?

36:54.171 --> 36:57.465
LOOK, I KNOW YOU'RE AT AN AGE

36:54.171 --> 36:57.465
WHERE THE WHOLE GIRL THING IS,

36:57.507 --> 36:59.467
YOU KNOW,

36:57.507 --> 36:59.467
ON YOUR MIND A LOT,

36:59.509 --> 37:01.761
AND IT'S PROBABLY NOT HELPING

36:59.509 --> 37:01.761
YOU TO THINK STRAIGHT

37:01.803 --> 37:04.430
WITH ALL THE HORMONES AND

37:01.803 --> 37:04.430
OTHER THINGS THAT ARE RAGING.

37:04.472 --> 37:09.310
MY POINT IS, YOU GOTTA

37:04.472 --> 37:09.310
THINK ABOUT THINGS A

37:04.472 --> 37:09.310
LITTLE BETTER, YOU KNOW?

37:09.352 --> 37:11.104
THE WAY YOU ACT.

37:11.146 --> 37:15.400
IF YOU CARE ABOUT A GIRL THE WAY

37:11.146 --> 37:15.400
YOU DO WITH THIS SHANE --

37:15.441 --> 37:17.318
I DON'T CARE ABOUT HER.

37:15.441 --> 37:17.318
WHAT?

37:17.360 --> 37:19.154
I DON'T EVEN KNOW HER

37:17.360 --> 37:19.154
LAST NAME.

37:19.196 --> 37:21.573
YOU'RE KIDDING.

37:19.196 --> 37:21.573
SHE MENTIONED IT ONCE.

37:19.196 --> 37:21.573
DIDN'T STICK.

37:21.614 --> 37:23.366
WHAT ARE YOU DOING

37:21.614 --> 37:23.366
WITH HER?

37:23.408 --> 37:25.326
JUST HANGING WITH HER.

37:23.408 --> 37:25.326
NO BIGGIE.

37:25.368 --> 37:27.871
YOU GOTTA BE DOING SOMETHING

37:25.368 --> 37:27.871
MORE THAN HANGING WITH HER.

37:27.913 --> 37:32.209
YOU HAVE TO AT LEAST BE DOING

37:27.913 --> 37:32.209
SOMETHING WITH HER

37:27.913 --> 37:32.209
TO MAKE HER JUMP IN A CLOSET.

37:32.250 --> 37:34.377
RELAX, WILL YOU?

37:32.250 --> 37:34.377
ALL'S GOOD.

37:34.419 --> 37:36.713
YOU CAN'T TREAT A GIRL

37:34.419 --> 37:36.713
LIKE THIS, LIKE DIRT!

37:36.755 --> 37:38.757
SHE TREATS ME

37:36.755 --> 37:38.757
LIKE DIRT, TOO.

37:38.798 --> 37:40.508
IT'S A PRETTY

37:38.798 --> 37:40.508
SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIP.

37:40.550 --> 37:44.345
AND THAT'S FINE WITH YOU TO JUST

37:40.550 --> 37:44.345
GO ALONG IN A RELATIONSHIP,

37:44.387 --> 37:47.140
YOU TREAT SOMEBODY BAD, AND THEY

37:44.387 --> 37:47.140
TREAT YOU BAD BACK.

37:47.182 --> 37:48.433
THAT'S RIGHT.

37:48.474 --> 37:49.851
THAT MAKES YOU HAPPY?

37:49.893 --> 37:52.187
I'D DO BACKFLIPS,

37:49.893 --> 37:52.187
BUT I AM WAY TOO COOL.

37:52.229 --> 37:53.772
THAT MAKES ABSOLUTELY

37:52.229 --> 37:53.772
NO SENSE.

37:53.813 --> 37:55.565
DOESN'T HAVE TO MAKE

37:53.813 --> 37:55.565
SENSE TO YOU.

37:55.607 --> 37:58.359
THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHER GIRLS

37:55.607 --> 37:58.359
OUT THERE IN THE WORLD.

37:58.401 --> 38:02.155
YOU COULD GO OUT AND

37:58.401 --> 38:02.155
AT LEAST FIND<i> ONE</i> THAT

37:58.401 --> 38:02.155
YOU ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT.

38:02.197 --> 38:03.531
LIKE IT'S THAT EASY.

38:03.573 --> 38:05.283
IT'S THAT EASY IF YOU TRY.

38:05.324 --> 38:08.120
THE GIRLS THAT I LIKE DON'T

38:05.324 --> 38:08.120
GIVE A DAMN ABOUT ME,

38:08.161 --> 38:11.456
AND UNLIKE SOME OTHER

38:08.161 --> 38:11.456
PEOPLE I KNOW, I'M NOT

38:08.161 --> 38:11.456
GONNA SIT AROUND HOPING

38:11.497 --> 38:13.750
THAT THEY CHANGE THEIR MINDS

38:11.497 --> 38:13.750
AND SUDDENLY NOTICE ME.

38:13.792 --> 38:15.085
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED

38:13.792 --> 38:15.085
TO MEAN?

38:15.127 --> 38:16.753
YOU FIXED ANY NEIGHBOR'S

38:15.127 --> 38:16.753
PORCHES LATELY

38:16.795 --> 38:19.839
OR YOU GO ON A PICNIC

38:16.795 --> 38:19.839
OR YOU GET ROOKED INTO GIVING

38:19.881 --> 38:21.633
A RIDICULOUS SPEECH AT A

38:19.881 --> 38:21.633
HIGH SCHOOL?

38:21.674 --> 38:23.760
AT LEAST I'VE GOT

38:21.674 --> 38:23.760
A LITTLE SELF-ESTEEM.

38:23.802 --> 38:26.345
SHUT UP.

38:23.802 --> 38:26.345
I'M NOT PLAYING GOLDEN

38:23.802 --> 38:26.345
RETRIEVER HOPING SOMEDAY,

38:26.387 --> 38:28.389
SHE'LL TURN AROUND AND FALL

38:26.387 --> 38:28.389
IN MY ARMS.

38:28.431 --> 38:30.934
IF SHE DOESN'T WANT TO

38:28.431 --> 38:30.934
BE WITH ME, THEN FINE!

38:30.976 --> 38:33.103
YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE

38:30.976 --> 38:33.103
TALKING ABOUT.

38:33.145 --> 38:34.771
WHATEVER.

38:33.145 --> 38:34.771
I GOTTA GO. SHANE'S WAITING.

38:34.813 --> 38:36.689
YOU MEAN WHAT'S HER NAME?

38:36.731 --> 38:40.735
YEAH, I'LL BRING YOU A NEW LEASH

38:36.731 --> 38:40.735
WHEN I GET BACK.

38:36.731 --> 38:40.735
GET OUT OF HERE.

38:40.777 --> 38:41.987
[ DOOR CLOSES ]

38:43.863 --> 38:46.365
BUSY DAY.

38:43.863 --> 38:46.365
<i>I'M</i> PRETTY EXHAUSTED.

38:46.407 --> 38:50.495
I GUESS IT WAS JUST TOO BIG

38:46.407 --> 38:50.495
OF A STATEMENT

38:46.407 --> 38:50.495
FOR ME TO MAKE RIGHT NOW.

38:50.536 --> 38:52.289
MAYBE.

38:50.536 --> 38:52.289
I JUST THOUGHT OF SOMETHING.

38:52.330 --> 38:55.250
TECHNICALLY,

38:52.330 --> 38:55.250
YOU HAVE DYED HAIR.

38:55.292 --> 38:56.793
I DO, DON'T I?

38:55.292 --> 38:56.793
YEAH.

38:56.835 --> 38:59.629
DYED MY NATURAL COLOR, YES,

38:56.835 --> 38:59.629
BUT DYED NONETHELESS.

38:59.671 --> 39:02.465
NOT ONE STRAND OF REAL COLOR ON

38:59.671 --> 39:02.465
THAT HEAD OF YOURS.

39:02.507 --> 39:05.802
SO, I GUESS THAT MEANS WE CAN

39:02.507 --> 39:05.802
SCORE THIS AS A VICTORY, RIGHT?

39:05.844 --> 39:08.054
ABSOLUTELY.

39:05.844 --> 39:08.054
PUT IT IN THE VICTORY COLUMN.

39:12.100 --> 39:13.518
THAT GIRL'S A FREAK.

39:15.228 --> 39:16.688
WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

39:16.729 --> 39:18.439
IT'S BEEN A VERY LONG

39:16.729 --> 39:18.439
DAY.

39:18.481 --> 39:20.525
PEOPLE WHO LIKE ME!

39:18.481 --> 39:20.525
GREAT!

39:20.566 --> 39:22.527
HOW WAS YOUR TALK AT

39:20.566 --> 39:22.527
THE SCHOOL?

39:22.568 --> 39:24.654
JUST PEACHY.

39:22.568 --> 39:24.654
IS YOUR HAIR BLACKER?

39:24.696 --> 39:26.489
I WISH YOU HADN'T HAVE

39:24.696 --> 39:26.489
SAID THAT.

39:26.531 --> 39:28.658
IT'S NOT NOTICEABLE.

39:26.531 --> 39:28.658
STAY OUT OF BRIGHT LIGHTING.

39:28.700 --> 39:30.035
WHAT HAPPENED?

39:30.076 --> 39:32.411
I DYED MY HAIR.

39:30.076 --> 39:32.411
THEN I DYED IT BACK.

39:32.453 --> 39:34.956
BUT FOR A FULL 30 MINUTES, I

39:32.453 --> 39:34.956
LOOKED LIKE THIS.

39:34.998 --> 39:37.167
WHOA! YOU LOOKED COOL.

39:34.998 --> 39:37.167
YOU'RE INSANE.

39:37.209 --> 39:39.961
I GOT SANE AGAIN, BUT I WILL

39:37.209 --> 39:39.961
ALWAYS HAVE THAT PICTURE.

39:40.003 --> 39:41.713
OH, HIDE IT AT YOUR

39:40.003 --> 39:41.713
PLACE?

39:41.754 --> 39:44.299
I GOTTA GO, AND REMEMBER, WE

39:41.754 --> 39:44.299
STILL NEED A PLAN.

39:44.341 --> 39:46.634
YES, WE DO.

39:44.341 --> 39:46.634
WHY DO WE NEED A PLAN?

39:46.676 --> 39:49.428
A PLAN SO THAT LANE DOESN'T HAVE

39:46.676 --> 39:49.428
TO QUIT HER BAND.

39:49.470 --> 39:53.016
LANE HAS TO GET FAMOUS AND

39:49.470 --> 39:53.016
INTRODUCE ME TO BONO!
