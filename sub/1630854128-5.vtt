00:07.485 --> 00:09.487
Over there. He works for me.

00:09.531 --> 00:10.706
- His lung is likely collapsed.

00:10.749 --> 00:12.273
- Let's get him out here.
- No, no, no.

00:12.316 --> 00:15.667
If we're gonna save him,
we got to do it right here.

00:15.711 --> 00:17.060
- I mean, what do you do
if you can't get

00:17.104 --> 00:18.670
the only drug that
will treat an infection?

00:18.714 --> 00:21.021
- I'll start calling around.
- Everyone I talk to is out.

00:21.064 --> 00:22.805
I know someone
who has access to everything.

00:22.848 --> 00:24.633
- You're talking like
some kind of drug dealer.

00:24.676 --> 00:26.461
Look, no one can ever know
about this.

00:26.504 --> 00:28.071
- In the future,
maybe at least page me

00:28.115 --> 00:29.681
before administering
a very high dose--

00:29.725 --> 00:31.944
- Six milligrams is well within
the standard of care.

00:31.988 --> 00:34.817

some blanket template

00:34.860 --> 00:36.384

00:36.427 --> 00:39.430
for the person you're supposed
to be helping.

00:39.474 --> 00:42.607
- I just don't always
trust my own instincts.

00:42.651 --> 00:44.348

you will get there.

in my mind.

Good morning.

00:49.919 --> 00:51.138

00:51.181 --> 00:53.531
So night shift left us
three patients.

00:53.575 --> 00:56.099
A bipolar woman, 38.
Checked herself in.

00:56.143 --> 00:58.536
A gentleman with CTE, 64.

00:58.580 --> 01:00.364
Got booted from
his board and care home.

01:00.408 --> 01:02.192

smoking violation?

01:02.236 --> 01:03.367
- [sighs]
Yeah.

01:03.411 --> 01:06.892
And lastly,
a 31-year-old psychotic

01:06.936 --> 01:08.285
in an extrapyramidal state.

01:08.329 --> 01:09.939
- You know, that gentleman
looks like we probably

01:09.982 --> 01:12.115
just have to rebalance his
meds, but these other two,

01:12.159 --> 01:13.290
I think we're gonna
have to admit.

01:13.334 --> 01:16.380
- Agreed, but once again,

01:16.424 --> 01:18.165
there are no beds
in the psych unit

01:18.208 --> 01:20.471
and all the other local EDs
are at capacity.

01:20.515 --> 01:21.820
- Well, we got to branch out.

01:21.864 --> 01:24.649
Check the TRCs.
See if they have any room.

01:24.693 --> 01:26.651
- Every morning
it's the same thing.

01:26.695 --> 01:30.655
Psych patients
just stashed around the ED.

01:30.699 --> 01:32.440
You know, my parents,
where they come from,

01:32.483 --> 01:34.616
no one talks about psychiatry.

01:34.659 --> 01:37.445
In fact, they're not convinced
I'm even a real doctor

01:37.488 --> 01:40.752
because my brother is
a pediatric spine surgeon.

01:40.796 --> 01:42.928
So they see him
helping kids walk again,

01:42.972 --> 01:45.409
but me...

01:45.453 --> 01:47.455
pretty good argument--
I'm not even treating patients,

01:47.498 --> 01:50.632
just shuffling them off
somewhere else.

01:51.807 --> 01:55.419
- Will. Will. Hey.
- Good morning.

01:55.463 --> 01:57.160

to Rose Fremont,

01:57.204 --> 01:58.683
our UTI from the other day,

01:58.727 --> 02:01.251
and I know what happened
didn't happen--

02:01.295 --> 02:02.296

02:02.339 --> 02:03.471
I've been
thinking about her too.

02:03.514 --> 02:05.255
How's she doing?
- She's amazing.

02:05.299 --> 02:07.170
She said she finally
feels like herself again.

02:07.214 --> 02:09.346

02:09.390 --> 02:10.913
Yeah, you know, still,

02:10.956 --> 02:13.133
we never buy drugs
from that dealer again.

in treatment six.

I need you in treatment four.

38:53.287 --> 38:56.421
So good work, Doctor.

38:56.464 --> 38:57.726
Really.
- Thanks.

39:03.776 --> 39:05.386
- Dr. Marcel.

39:05.430 --> 39:06.692
- Yeah. Hey.

39:06.735 --> 39:08.737
- You already started
weaning the vent?

39:11.044 --> 39:13.263
- The new lungs are working.

39:13.307 --> 39:16.049
I hope to try an SBT tomorrow,
but we're off to a good start.

39:16.092 --> 39:17.964
- Well, internet's gonna
blow up.

39:18.007 --> 39:19.879
I got 30 million
social media followers

39:19.922 --> 39:21.271
waiting to hear
how this story ends.

39:21.315 --> 39:23.012
- Yeah, Med's gonna
go viral, huh?

39:23.056 --> 39:24.753
- Not just Med, Dr. Marcel.

39:24.797 --> 39:27.974
You saved Nathaniel's life
twice now.

39:28.017 --> 39:31.369
Both in spectacular fashion.

39:31.412 --> 39:32.892
- What are you on, by the way?

39:32.935 --> 39:35.590
Twitter, Insta, TikTok?
- None of the above.

39:35.634 --> 39:37.287
- [sighs]
Well, no worries.

39:37.331 --> 39:41.074
I'll text my PR team.
Set up accounts for you.

39:41.117 --> 39:45.208
- In the meantime, get ready
for what comes next.

39:45.252 --> 39:47.036
- What's that?

39:47.080 --> 39:48.386
- Fame.
