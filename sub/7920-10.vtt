WEBVTT

00:03.337 --> 00:05.104
So your flight
leaves tomorrow, so...

00:05.106 --> 00:06.438
Yes, if we're ever gonna have
sex, we gotta do it right now.

00:06.440 --> 00:08.173
Now, what-what
I was actually gonna say

00:08.175 --> 00:09.375
is do you want to print your
boarding pass at the airport

00:09.377 --> 00:10.676
and use their ink
instead of ours,

00:10.678 --> 00:12.111
but I like that
yours ended with sex.

00:12.113 --> 00:13.612
I said sex,
but I meant meaningless sex.

00:13.614 --> 00:14.613
Oh, I heard that.
That's what I heard.

00:14.615 --> 00:15.514
I heard meaningless sex.

00:15.516 --> 00:16.615
I'm gonna be in my room.

00:16.617 --> 00:18.117
Yeah, I'm right behind you.

00:18.119 --> 00:19.118
Time-wise.
I'm not pitching positions.

00:19.120 --> 00:20.786
Okay, great.

00:23.557 --> 00:25.324
Holy...

00:25.326 --> 00:26.725
JESS: Hi!

00:26.727 --> 00:27.793
Oh, my God!

00:27.795 --> 00:29.161
I am so sorry.

00:29.163 --> 00:30.529
Nobody was here when I got home,

00:30.531 --> 00:32.131
and the bed just
looked so good, I went

00:32.133 --> 00:33.966
full Goldilocks,
and you must be Reagan!

00:33.968 --> 00:35.534
It's so good to meet you.

00:35.536 --> 00:36.902
I put on my special
underwear, because...

00:36.904 --> 00:38.837
Nick!
Jess is back!

00:38.839 --> 00:40.139
And I made a promise

00:40.141 --> 00:41.473
to myself when you left

00:41.475 --> 00:42.875
I'd be wearing these
when you came back!

00:42.877 --> 00:44.576
And I'm doing it.
Oh, my God! Thank you!

00:44.578 --> 00:46.412
I'm doing it. I'm doing it.

00:47.915 --> 00:49.982
All right, great,
I'm gonna get out of here.

00:49.984 --> 00:52.384
No, stay.
Nah! Nah!

00:52.386 --> 00:54.153
♪ ♪

00:56.157 --> 00:58.991
JESS: The LA County Courthouse
gift shop is straight up bull.

00:58.993 --> 01:01.060
Can you believe I had
to have these shirts made?

01:01.062 --> 01:02.428
Yeah, I can believe that.

01:02.430 --> 01:04.229
Where's Reagan? Probably putting
on her shirt still.

01:04.231 --> 01:06.398
Yeah, Reagan's not exactly
the matching T type.

01:06.400 --> 01:08.367
I-I feel like the moment
has passed, don't you?

01:08.369 --> 01:09.835
Yeah, I feel like it's so passed.
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

01:09.837 --> 01:11.437
That's the thing
about moments, though.

01:11.439 --> 01:14.073
They come and they go.
They're fleeting.

01:14.075 --> 01:15.607
That's a moment.

01:15.609 --> 01:16.842
This is a moment.

01:16.844 --> 01:19.078
Which makes me believe
that although

01:19.080 --> 01:20.746
that one passed, maybe it...

01:20.748 --> 01:23.615
It's also just, um,
I'm leaving tomorrow.

01:23.617 --> 01:25.350
Yeah. So we don't want
to make it complicated.

01:25.352 --> 01:26.552
I mean, right now
we're just roommates

01:26.554 --> 01:28.053
that made out a couple of times.

01:28.055 --> 01:29.521
Well, I'm glad
we talked this out.

01:29.523 --> 01:31.056
Now your last day here
won't be weird.

01:31.058 --> 01:32.458
Nothing about this conversation

01:32.460 --> 01:34.026
makes me believe that
that is true.

01:35.196 --> 01:37.096
(snaps)
Yeah.

01:37.098 --> 01:38.897
(sighs, scoffs)

01:38.899 --> 01:40.365
(snaps)

01:42.436 --> 01:44.269
Glad it's not gonna be weird.

01:44.271 --> 01:46.872
Winston's weekly letters.

01:46.874 --> 01:49.374
90% redacted,
but still full of news.

01:49.376 --> 01:51.243
"I'll leave you with my thoughts
on the trial."

01:51.245 --> 01:53.045
Big black line, big black line.

01:53.047 --> 01:54.880
They redacted that stuff?
Big black line.

01:54.882 --> 01:56.615
"LOL." Big black line.

01:56.617 --> 01:59.618
"Gotta go, or I'll be late
for my first dance class."

01:59.620 --> 02:01.086
You know, actually the dance
class has become

02:01.088 --> 02:02.454
more of a dance gathering.

02:02.456 --> 02:03.956
You know what, maybe Schmidt
and I will join you,

02:03.958 --> 02:05.257
because the wedding
is almost here,

02:05.259 --> 02:07.059
and we have to work
on our first dance.

02:07.061 --> 02:08.961
Come. I mean,
you know, two more referrals

02:08.963 --> 02:11.130
and I get to have
my birthday party there.

02:11.132 --> 02:12.764
JESS: Hey, Reagan.
Hello.

02:12.766 --> 02:14.099
How was jury duty?

02:14.101 --> 02:16.502
Jury duty was quite simply
the tops.

02:16.504 --> 02:17.503
Did I have a knack for it?

02:17.505 --> 02:19.571
I suppose.
Was I elected foreman?

02:19.573 --> 02:21.273
Unanimously.

02:21.275 --> 02:22.975
Am I going on the news tomorrow

02:22.977 --> 02:24.309
to explain the verdict

02:24.311 --> 02:25.611
to laymen non-jurors? (chuckles)

02:25.613 --> 02:26.912
You know I am.

02:26.914 --> 02:28.514
(chuckles) Nice! And yet,

02:28.516 --> 02:31.283
I nearly threw it all away
for love.

02:31.285 --> 02:35.320
<i> His name was Juror 237B,</i>

02:35.322 --> 02:36.922
<i> and we made the courthouse</i>

02:36.924 --> 02:38.123
<i> our hothouse.</i>

02:38.125 --> 02:41.093
Blood splatters, mucous seeps.

02:41.095 --> 02:43.128
JESS:<i> But nothing</i>
<i> could happen between us,</i>

02:43.130 --> 02:44.263

02:52.306 --> 02:55.140

02:55.142 --> 02:56.508

vows Jessica Day!

03:01.148 --> 03:03.815
Page two:
It's war in the Pacific!

03:03.817 --> 03:05.350
What?!

03:05.352 --> 03:06.652
NICK:
<i> Schmidt...</i>

03:06.654 --> 03:07.853
I... Schmidt!

03:07.855 --> 03:09.021
I need your help.

03:09.023 --> 03:10.622
This is Reagan's last day.

03:10.624 --> 03:12.124
I know it is, and you know what?

03:12.126 --> 03:13.859
Whatever embarrassments
or failures

03:13.861 --> 03:15.561
the rest of your life may hold,

03:15.563 --> 03:16.795
no one can ever take away

03:16.797 --> 03:18.163
what you've accomplished
this week.

03:18.165 --> 03:19.831
A goddess walked among us,

03:19.833 --> 03:21.400
and you went
to first base with her.

03:21.402 --> 03:22.734
Several times.

03:22.736 --> 03:24.169
And I actually did
a really good job kissing her.

03:24.171 --> 03:25.571
But now I'm making it weird.

03:25.573 --> 03:26.338
No.
Yeah, every time

03:26.340 --> 03:27.673
I open my mouth,

03:27.675 --> 03:30.075
I'm tarnishing my legacy
a little bit.

03:30.077 --> 03:32.044
But I have a plan.
I'm gonna shut up.

03:32.046 --> 03:33.178
Love it.

03:33.180 --> 03:34.846
I'm not finished yet.
There's more to my plan.

03:34.848 --> 03:36.181
Do you need more?
Yes, I need more.

03:36.183 --> 03:37.649
What more could there be?
Just shut up.

03:37.651 --> 03:39.084
I'm going to shut up

03:39.086 --> 03:40.686
until we say good-bye.

03:40.688 --> 03:42.554
And then...

03:42.556 --> 03:45.023
I'm gonna hit her
with a Goosebumps Walkaway.

03:45.025 --> 03:46.091
I don't know who he is.

03:46.093 --> 03:47.025
Is he an old-fashioned
baseball player?

03:47.027 --> 03:48.493
Goosebumps Walkaway is the line

03:48.495 --> 03:49.995
that they guy says to the girl

03:49.997 --> 03:52.864
in the movie
that gives her goosebumps

03:52.866 --> 03:54.766
and then
he walks away forever.

03:54.768 --> 03:56.435
It's that line that...
That haunts her.

03:56.437 --> 03:57.836
That consumes her.

03:57.838 --> 03:59.905
That rings in her ear
for all of eternity,

03:59.907 --> 04:01.206
granting you...

04:01.208 --> 04:03.242
BOTH (whispering):
Immortality.

04:03.244 --> 04:04.443
You're damn right.
Immortality.

04:04.445 --> 04:06.445
Come here. I want to say

04:06.447 --> 04:08.046
good-bye to you.

04:08.048 --> 04:09.881
But it's not true.

04:09.883 --> 04:12.084
So-so bad-bye, Reagan.

04:12.086 --> 04:14.620
Bad... bye.

04:14.622 --> 04:16.688
Okay, that was terrible.

04:16.690 --> 04:18.724
Now, go write 20 more.

04:18.726 --> 04:20.626
Learn them, inhabit them,
practice them,

04:20.628 --> 04:21.927
and then throw those away.

04:21.929 --> 04:24.096
Then write another 20 and submit
them to me for my approval.

04:24.098 --> 04:25.430
Can bad-bye be one of them?

04:25.432 --> 04:26.932
No.
So 40 new ones.

04:26.934 --> 04:29.701
Yeah.
That's too... that's excessive.

04:29.703 --> 04:31.703
REAGAN:<i> So, what is your plan</i>
<i> for finding this guy?</i>

04:31.705 --> 04:35.641
I'm typing words I know
about him into a computer.

04:35.643 --> 04:37.643
(typing)
Handsome

04:37.645 --> 04:40.512
plus Los Angeles plus 237B...

04:42.750 --> 04:44.049
(sighs) ...is a dead end.

04:44.051 --> 04:46.151
Not if you're looking
for Japanese adult film star,

04:46.153 --> 04:47.452
Handsome Los Angeles.

04:47.454 --> 04:48.920
Born in February of 1937?

04:48.922 --> 04:51.123
Handsome,
tell me your secrets.

04:51.125 --> 04:52.557
Looks like you are
figuring that out.

04:52.559 --> 04:55.327
So I'm gonna go anywhere else.

04:55.329 --> 04:56.928
(knocking on door)

04:56.930 --> 04:58.697
Hey, Jess.

04:59.433 --> 05:00.432
Hi.
Hey, Reagan.

05:00.434 --> 05:02.334
Wow, you were in here.
I was, yeah.

05:02.336 --> 05:03.669
Anybody else back there?
(forced laughter)

05:03.671 --> 05:05.137
If there was, I'd be terrified.

05:05.139 --> 05:06.138
It's a small space.

05:07.107 --> 05:08.407
So you and Jess
are just talking.

05:08.409 --> 05:09.775
I can only imagine what you guys
are talking about.

05:09.777 --> 05:11.977
Well... I can't stand
it for another second.

05:11.979 --> 05:14.112
I have to address the 800-pound
gorilla that's in this room.

05:14.114 --> 05:15.314
It's elephant in the room.

05:15.316 --> 05:17.349
800-pound gorilla
is a different thing.

05:17.351 --> 05:19.117
Okay, I guess I have to address
the 800-pound elephant

05:19.119 --> 05:20.085
that's in the middle
of the room.

05:20.087 --> 05:21.086
It's just elephant.
The 800 pounds,

05:21.088 --> 05:22.754
that goes
with the gorilla thing.

05:22.756 --> 05:24.990
800 pounds is not
a very big elephant.

05:24.992 --> 05:28.093
Jess! Reagan and I
were romantic together.

05:28.095 --> 05:28.927
Ooh.

05:28.929 --> 05:30.529
I didn't know that.

05:30.531 --> 05:33.532
Which means I've been romantic
with both of you.

05:33.534 --> 05:34.700
Cool.
And it's not just

05:34.702 --> 05:36.101
because you have brown hair

05:36.103 --> 05:37.936
and you've shared this room.

05:37.938 --> 05:40.539
But because you're great,
top-shelf ladies.

05:40.541 --> 05:43.608
And I had the opportunity, and
so I reached in the cookie jar,

05:43.610 --> 05:46.144
and I grabbed a chocolate chip
and an oatmeal.

05:46.146 --> 05:47.512
And I'm not saying who's who.

05:47.514 --> 05:48.714
(sighs)
I've gotten off-track.

05:48.716 --> 05:50.215
Your worlds must be turned

05:50.217 --> 05:51.950
absolutely upside down.

05:51.952 --> 05:53.785
This must be devastating,
as it is to me.

05:53.787 --> 05:56.655
We're all feeling emotions we
couldn't even begin to discuss.

05:56.657 --> 05:58.790
A lot of us are having
bad anxiety,

05:58.792 --> 06:00.559
and our legs are feeling
weird and tingly.

06:00.561 --> 06:02.060
I think we're fine with it.

06:02.963 --> 06:04.196
I think it's great.

06:04.198 --> 06:06.031
I'm really glad I came in here

06:06.033 --> 06:07.899
and, uh, talked about this.

06:07.901 --> 06:10.469
I feel like we've gotten
a lot of... Great.

06:11.405 --> 06:12.671
Mm-hmm.

06:12.673 --> 06:14.539
Well...

06:14.541 --> 06:16.808
Winston! (chuckles)

06:16.810 --> 06:17.843
I didn't hear Winston.

06:17.845 --> 06:18.977
He just screamed my name.

06:18.979 --> 06:20.045
He needs help.

06:20.047 --> 06:21.847
All right,
I'm coming to save you.

06:21.849 --> 06:24.383
That's the most embarrassed
I've ever been

06:24.385 --> 06:26.418
for anyone not doing improv.

06:26.420 --> 06:27.919
He's being so weird.

06:27.921 --> 06:30.055
I gotta get out of here
for the day.

06:30.057 --> 06:32.224
Well, how would you like
to drive around Los Angeles

06:32.226 --> 06:33.825
and look for a juror?

06:35.028 --> 06:37.596

You and Nick,

06:48.609 --> 06:49.674
The power went out.

06:49.676 --> 06:50.776
We went into the basement.

06:50.778 --> 06:52.611
There were rats,
he passed out, we kissed.

06:52.613 --> 06:53.612
(squealing softly):
Oh, my God.

06:53.614 --> 06:55.013
And you like him.

06:55.015 --> 06:57.015
No. No, I don't.

06:57.017 --> 06:58.049
We just hooked up a few times.

06:58.051 --> 06:59.418
Let's focus on you.

06:59.420 --> 07:00.452
Here's a courtroom sketch.

07:00.454 --> 07:03.355
Yep, there he is, 237B.

07:03.357 --> 07:04.723
God, he can dress.

07:04.725 --> 07:05.924
But we're gonna
need more than that.

07:05.926 --> 07:07.626
We need something distinctive,
so did he have like a...

07:07.628 --> 07:09.928
he walked with a limp
or he had a hook hand

07:09.930 --> 07:11.696
or a neck tattoo--
anything?

07:11.698 --> 07:13.131
No. (chuckles)

07:13.133 --> 07:14.232
He was perfect.

07:14.234 --> 07:15.367
We all were.

07:16.904 --> 07:18.470
<i> Except for the guy</i>
<i> sitting next to him,</i>

07:18.472 --> 07:21.139
<i> 9C-- ugh.</i>

07:21.141 --> 07:22.908
REAGAN:
<i> What was wrong with him?</i>

07:22.910 --> 07:26.111
He never got why<i> Bunt v. Che</i>
was a relevant precedent.

07:26.113 --> 07:28.647
Also he wheezed... a lot.

07:28.649 --> 07:29.981
Like the door
of a haunted house.

07:29.983 --> 07:30.982
He has asthma.

07:30.984 --> 07:32.317
<i> We can find that guy</i>

07:32.319 --> 07:34.753
<i> and see if he knows anything.</i>

07:34.755 --> 07:36.755
I used to peddle inhalers.
What color was his?

07:36.757 --> 07:38.290
Oh, uh... red.

07:38.292 --> 07:40.091
Like the door
of a haunted house!

07:40.093 --> 07:41.226
Sorry. (laughs)

07:41.228 --> 07:42.294
The only group excursion

07:42.296 --> 07:44.229
we took was
to a haunted house.

07:44.231 --> 07:45.464
By the way,
if you like haunted houses

07:45.466 --> 07:47.065
but hate lines,
January's a great time to go--

07:47.067 --> 07:48.133
Dr. Foley?

07:48.135 --> 07:49.434
Reagan Lucas.

07:49.436 --> 07:51.102
I was just calling to
ask you if you were still

07:51.104 --> 07:52.671
handing out samples
of Ciliabreez?

07:52.673 --> 07:54.339
Six months
after the recall?

07:54.341 --> 07:55.674
Oh, dang.

07:55.676 --> 07:56.508
Jim?

07:56.510 --> 07:57.609
Nothing more bad-ass

07:57.611 --> 07:59.144
than calling a doctor
by his first name.

07:59.146 --> 08:00.912
(shushing)
Sorry.

08:00.914 --> 08:02.948
All I need from you is
the name of a patient.

08:02.950 --> 08:05.784
(Digital Underground's
"The Humpty Dance" playing)

08:05.786 --> 08:07.152
SCHMIDT:
What is this, Winston?

08:07.154 --> 08:08.954
Who are all these
unusual people?

08:08.956 --> 08:10.355
Where's the instructor?

08:10.357 --> 08:12.157
It is a gathering,
not a class.

08:12.159 --> 08:13.525
I've told you that before.

08:13.527 --> 08:15.026
Listen, it's fun.

08:15.028 --> 08:17.429
That's not dancing.
These people aren't dancing.

08:17.431 --> 08:18.497
Dancing is about precision

08:18.499 --> 08:20.832
and domination and sweat.

08:20.834 --> 08:23.101
Check out my ass.
Check out my ass!

08:23.103 --> 08:25.971
My butt is alive!
(whoops)

08:25.973 --> 08:29.608
(dancers clamoring)

08:29.610 --> 08:31.776
SCHMIDT: We're not gonna learn
our first dance here.

08:31.778 --> 08:33.545
I'm gonna call my Beijing
Opening Ceremonies contact.

08:33.547 --> 08:35.013
He's fantastic.
No, no, no.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.648
Look, I always imagined
that our first dance

08:36.650 --> 08:39.351
would just be you and me
having the time of our lives.

08:39.353 --> 08:41.453
Very choreographed time
of our lives.  No.

08:41.455 --> 08:44.356
Having fun-- that's how I want
to start our lives together.

08:44.358 --> 08:45.624
Can you please just try?

08:45.626 --> 08:46.691
Please?

08:46.693 --> 08:48.527
Yeah, I'll-I'll-I'll try.

08:48.529 --> 08:50.161
Just listen to the music.

08:50.163 --> 08:52.797
Let it build.
Let it build.

08:52.799 --> 08:54.900
Got to let it wash over you--
Oh, there's the wave!

08:54.902 --> 08:56.401
Let it wash over me
on the three count?

08:56.403 --> 08:57.669
Yes!

08:57.671 --> 08:58.970
I think so.

08:58.972 --> 09:01.673
It's happening.
It's happening.

09:01.675 --> 09:04.075
Well, just teach me the steps
and I'd be happy to join in.

09:04.077 --> 09:06.878
There are no steps.

09:06.880 --> 09:07.913
What dance are you guys doing?

09:07.915 --> 09:09.681
Because it is not Humpty's!

09:09.683 --> 09:12.851
♪ This is my dance, y'all,
Humpty Hump's my name... ♪

09:12.853 --> 09:14.419
This is<i> his</i> dance, y'all!

09:14.421 --> 09:17.088
And Humpty Hump is his name!

09:17.090 --> 09:19.057
During Cece's first wedding,

09:19.059 --> 09:20.559
Nick and I went into a duct

09:20.561 --> 09:22.928
to catch a badger
that Winston had released.

09:22.930 --> 09:24.262
Naturally.
It was crazy!

09:24.264 --> 09:25.263
It was chaotic!

09:25.265 --> 09:28.099
It was largely Nick's fault.

09:28.101 --> 09:30.101
But then I realized
he's the only person

09:30.103 --> 09:31.670
I'd ever go into a duct with.

09:34.708 --> 09:36.241
Nick kind of
sneaks up on you.

09:36.243 --> 09:38.243
You think he's one thing...

09:38.245 --> 09:39.945
and then...

09:44.952 --> 09:47.052
Yeah, Nick is great.

09:47.054 --> 09:48.420
But I'm leaving and

09:48.422 --> 09:49.888
we're both cool about that so--

09:49.890 --> 09:52.691
Oh, right, you're both
totally cool about it.

09:52.693 --> 09:54.893
I get Goosebumps Walka--
Okay, okay, just think-- okay.

09:54.895 --> 09:56.995
Oh, wait, Reagan, before you go!

09:58.131 --> 10:02.100
"Wherever the fridge
of life takes you..."

10:02.102 --> 10:04.302
You came in, I liked you,
then you left!

10:04.304 --> 10:06.071
What, what is that...?!

10:06.073 --> 10:08.807
Stop thinking...

10:08.809 --> 10:10.475
that this is good-bye.

10:10.477 --> 10:13.144
And start knowing it as...

10:13.146 --> 10:15.747
bye...

10:15.749 --> 10:16.982
bye.

10:16.984 --> 10:20.251
Pretend I didn't do the "byes."

10:20.253 --> 10:22.454
REAGAN: <i> So, Dr. Foley says our
guy</i> <i> spends all of his time here.</i>

10:22.456 --> 10:25.023
With all this grass,
no wonder his asthma is bad.

10:25.659 --> 10:26.658
JESS:
Oh, hey!

10:26.660 --> 10:27.959
There he is!

10:27.961 --> 10:30.095
Hey, 9C!

10:30.097 --> 10:32.664
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, no!

10:32.666 --> 10:35.066
You do not run my life anymore.
Good-bye!

10:35.068 --> 10:36.234
Is that adult man
afraid of you?

10:36.236 --> 10:38.837
I take a bathroom break
when I want to!

10:38.839 --> 10:40.071
I cracked skulls as foreman.

10:40.073 --> 10:41.306
Whoa, whoa.

10:43.176 --> 10:44.275
JESS:
"Men only"?!

10:44.277 --> 10:45.844
It's 2016!

10:45.846 --> 10:47.078
Clearly, I make the rules.

10:47.080 --> 10:49.314
That's why my office is a hut.

10:50.450 --> 10:52.450
Fine, we'll get a man.

10:52.452 --> 10:54.285
So, Winston didn't answer.

10:54.287 --> 10:55.587
Schmidt said, "They're
desecrating the Time Warp.

10:55.589 --> 10:57.255
Desecrating it!"
And he hung up.

10:57.257 --> 10:58.823
But I got a hold of Nick.

10:58.825 --> 10:59.991
He said that he's super busy,

10:59.993 --> 11:01.860
which means he's
naked and doodling.

11:01.862 --> 11:03.928
But he said he'd make time
for us, which is good.

11:03.930 --> 11:05.530
Wait, sorry, so Nick is coming?
Yeah.

11:05.532 --> 11:07.999
No, just call him and
tell him not to come.

11:08.001 --> 11:08.767
I thought you were cool.

11:08.769 --> 11:09.601
I am cool.

11:09.603 --> 11:11.536
You don't really seem cool.

11:11.538 --> 11:13.438
It's just that when I see
him, it's a, it's weird,

11:13.440 --> 11:14.606
Mm-hmm.
'cause I'm, I'm leaving

11:14.608 --> 11:15.974
and it's, it's complicated.

11:15.976 --> 11:18.343
I do-- I just, I don't
really know how to... Right.

11:18.345 --> 11:20.779
God, I'm crazy about him!

11:20.781 --> 11:22.113
Yes! I knew it!

11:22.115 --> 11:23.214
I knew it.
Okay, yes.

11:23.216 --> 11:24.315
That's enough.
You're right.

11:24.317 --> 11:25.784
You know what happens now.

11:25.786 --> 11:26.985
I don't want to hug you.

11:26.987 --> 11:28.153
You know what happens now!

11:28.155 --> 11:29.120
I'm not hugging you.

11:29.122 --> 11:30.155
Yeah, you are.

11:30.157 --> 11:31.389
I'm not hugging you.

11:36.697 --> 11:38.129
You know the juror's name?

11:38.131 --> 11:39.831
I think it was 237B.

11:39.833 --> 11:41.066
What's that guy's name, yeah?
Oh, yeah, no.

11:41.068 --> 11:42.734
I really, really can't.
It's like... Nah...

11:42.736 --> 11:44.335
I like<i> that</i> guy, really?

11:44.337 --> 11:46.538
What's the name of the juror?
No!

11:46.540 --> 11:49.007
Calls hand sanitizer
"ham sanitizer."

11:49.009 --> 11:50.366
Tell me the name and
I'll give you the hat!

11:50.392 --> 11:51.209
Quit it! Quit it!

11:51.211 --> 11:53.178
He calls DNA  "D and A."

11:53.180 --> 11:54.979
You want grass stain
on this white hat?!

11:54.981 --> 11:55.980
Please no.

11:55.982 --> 11:57.015
But he kisses you like

11:57.017 --> 11:58.983
a coal miner
greeting his wife.

11:58.985 --> 12:01.419
After a day
in the caves.

12:01.421 --> 12:03.421
Did they go into caves?

12:03.423 --> 12:05.423
237B is Gary Garcia!
Gary?

12:05.425 --> 12:07.158
I'm not jumping this! Let's go!
You get back here!

12:07.160 --> 12:08.393
Gary Garcia!

12:08.395 --> 12:10.195
SCHMIDT:
Look at her out there.

12:10.197 --> 12:12.263
Treating the laws of music

12:12.265 --> 12:14.833
as mere suggestions of music.

12:14.835 --> 12:16.434
Must be frightening
to love a daredevil.

12:16.436 --> 12:18.603
What happened to you?

12:18.605 --> 12:19.938
Growing up a husky boy,

12:19.940 --> 12:22.040
I learned that I had
no margin for error.

12:22.042 --> 12:23.208
(Van McCoy's
"The Hustle" playing)

12:27.013 --> 12:28.847
Hey, fatty,
it's called "The Hustle."

12:28.849 --> 12:31.416
(laughter)

12:31.418 --> 12:33.218
SCHMIDT: <i> The slightest
mistake</i> <i> meant ridicule,</i>

12:33.220 --> 12:35.053
<i> so I had to learn</i>
<i> to do everything perfectly.</i>

12:35.055 --> 12:37.388
<i> I learned to dance</i>
<i> a dance the way</i>

12:37.390 --> 12:38.923
<i>that it was meant to be danced.</i>

12:38.925 --> 12:40.625
<i> And until I learned to dance</i>

12:40.627 --> 12:42.627
<i> that dance perfectly,</i>
<i>I would never dance that dance.</i>

12:42.629 --> 12:45.029
(shouts)

12:45.031 --> 12:48.066
<i> And then exactly</i>
<i> 364 days later...</i>

12:53.106 --> 12:55.173

GIRL: Go!

12:56.943 --> 12:59.410
(cheering)
BOY: Whoa!

12:59.412 --> 13:01.079
No complaints here, fatty.

13:01.081 --> 13:03.081
No complaints.

13:03.083 --> 13:04.816
Let me ask you a question
about this mean kid

13:04.818 --> 13:07.552
at the talent show--
was he a child emperor?

13:07.554 --> 13:09.721
No, he was as poor
and trashy as they come.

13:09.723 --> 13:12.090
So he had no power
over you then or now.

13:12.092 --> 13:13.558
Schmidt,

13:13.560 --> 13:16.261
you got to stop letting childish
ridicule dictate your actions.

13:16.263 --> 13:18.296
Oh, yeah, well, your-your smelly
butt looks dumb in those pants.

13:18.298 --> 13:20.732
(cell phone rings)

13:20.734 --> 13:22.066
Hello?
Winston, I need you

13:22.068 --> 13:23.802
to run a name
through the system.

13:23.804 --> 13:25.303
That's a real thing, right?

13:25.305 --> 13:27.138
MALE OFFICER: Yeah, nice vest!
(whistling)

13:27.140 --> 13:29.073
Hey, look, Bishop altered
his uniform again.

13:29.075 --> 13:30.575
(laughter)

13:30.577 --> 13:31.576
Poor guy.

13:31.578 --> 13:33.111
It's a bloodbath.

13:33.113 --> 13:34.479
He'll live. Come here,
come here, come here.

13:34.481 --> 13:35.947
Come here!

13:35.949 --> 13:37.482
So, here's my plan.

13:37.484 --> 13:38.683
I knock on Reagan's door
and the moment

13:38.685 --> 13:40.318
before she says good-bye,

13:40.320 --> 13:42.287
I give her the Goosebumps
Walkaway of your choosing,

13:42.289 --> 13:43.655
and then I walk away.

13:43.657 --> 13:45.323
What direction? What direction?
Do I, uh--?

13:45.325 --> 13:46.858
Do you go left,
right or backwards?

13:46.860 --> 13:47.926
Left, le... uh, left!

13:47.928 --> 13:48.927
Nick.

13:48.929 --> 13:50.695
Uh, right, right.

13:50.697 --> 13:52.096
Backwards.
Left is a great choice.

13:52.098 --> 13:53.031
'Cause that's
what I started with.

13:53.033 --> 13:54.666
Left is a great choice.
Thank you, man.

13:54.668 --> 13:55.700
That's, that was
my instinct, left.

13:55.702 --> 13:58.136
And I would read that one.

13:58.138 --> 14:01.105
That's 'cause this
is a perfect one.

14:01.107 --> 14:02.340
When are you gonna tell him
how you feel?

14:02.342 --> 14:04.342
Never.
I'm still leaving.

14:04.344 --> 14:05.944
What would be the point
of telling him how I feel

14:05.946 --> 14:07.812
when nothing can
possibly come from it?

14:07.814 --> 14:08.980
WINSTON:
So...

14:08.982 --> 14:10.982
there are 28 guys
named Gary Garcia.

14:10.984 --> 14:13.017
Great, I can do that. That's not bad.
Really?

14:13.019 --> 14:15.019
On that piece
of paper.

14:15.021 --> 14:17.021
931 in the system;
still printing.

14:21.962 --> 14:23.127
Are you sure
that Gary didn't have

14:23.129 --> 14:24.796
something distinctive
about him?

14:24.798 --> 14:27.232
Just a smile big and wide,

14:27.234 --> 14:31.035
like the door
of a haunted house.

14:32.405 --> 14:34.372
Boy, was I wrong.
Gary Garcia.

14:34.374 --> 14:37.976
In my mind,
he was Lawrence from Torrance.

14:37.978 --> 14:40.144
In your wildest fantasies,
he lives in Torrance?

14:40.146 --> 14:42.981
Lawrence<i> from</i> Torrance,
not Lawrence<i> of</i> Torrance.

14:42.983 --> 14:44.549
He was born
in Torrance,

14:44.551 --> 14:45.850
but now he lives in Brentwood.

14:45.852 --> 14:48.186
Lawrence of Brentwood.

14:48.188 --> 14:50.655
Kind of sounds like the sponsor
at the end of a game show.

14:50.657 --> 14:51.923
Yeah.

14:51.925 --> 14:53.424
furnished by
Lawrence of Brentwood."

14:53.426 --> 14:54.425
Yeah.

14:54.427 --> 14:55.860
(giggles)

14:55.862 --> 14:57.395
This is why you should
tell Nick how you feel.

14:58.865 --> 15:00.431
Even if nothing
comes of it.

15:00.433 --> 15:02.667
So you won't end up like me.

15:02.669 --> 15:04.068
I never told Gary how I feel,

15:04.070 --> 15:05.670
and now I never can.

15:05.672 --> 15:08.039
You can, and you should.

15:08.041 --> 15:11.242
Don't let Miller
become your Garcia.

15:15.448 --> 15:16.514
Hi, Nick.

15:19.052 --> 15:20.618
I want to say something to you
before we say good-bye.

15:20.620 --> 15:22.120
Shh...

15:23.056 --> 15:24.055
Ew.

15:24.057 --> 15:27.025
Sayonara, Sammy.

15:27.027 --> 15:28.927
Sayonara.

15:28.929 --> 15:30.094
What?

15:37.070 --> 15:38.102
That's the shower.

15:38.104 --> 15:39.203
(whispering):
I know it is.

15:45.078 --> 15:46.044
Hello and good morning.
Hello and good morning.

15:46.046 --> 15:47.045
You okay?

15:47.047 --> 15:48.046
It's not so bad

15:48.048 --> 15:49.213
if I don't think
about the trial.

ALAN:
Also with us, via satellite,

16:05.398 --> 16:06.998
is another member of the jury.

WINSTON: Whoa...

What are the odds?

16:12.739 --> 16:14.172
Well, exactly
one in 11, Nick.

Gary! Gary, it's me!

Gary!
Madam Foreman?

16:29.322 --> 16:30.621
Is that you?

16:30.623 --> 16:33.191
Yes! I'm Jess
and I like you!

16:33.193 --> 16:35.126
I'm Gary
and I like you, too.

16:35.128 --> 16:36.461
(laughing)
There it is!

16:36.463 --> 16:37.829
(chuckling)

16:37.831 --> 16:39.530
Man, they sound like
Cookie Monster's parents.

16:39.532 --> 16:40.832
How do I get
in touch with you?

16:40.834 --> 16:42.100
It's gargar...

16:42.102 --> 16:45.136
It's G-A-R-G-A-R,
like Gary with no "Y"s,

16:45.138 --> 16:47.138
twice, no spaces. Someone
get me a freakin' pen!

"J" as in Jack,
"D" as in dog...

17:03.023 --> 17:05.156
Should she be giving out

17:05.158 --> 17:07.025
her personal information
on TV? I mean...

17:07.027 --> 17:08.626
JESS:
...at...

17:08.628 --> 17:09.694
...verdicts get appealed.

17:09.696 --> 17:11.129
And killers go free.

17:11.131 --> 17:13.031
Eh, hard to be
killed over e-mail.

17:13.033 --> 17:15.400
...and I live at
310 Traction Avenue,

17:15.402 --> 17:17.035
apartment 4D.
Easy to be killed in your home.

17:17.037 --> 17:18.169
You know where to find me!

17:18.171 --> 17:19.504
I need to see you now!

17:19.506 --> 17:21.172
Okay, I know exactly
where to go.

17:21.174 --> 17:23.007
Stay tuned
for your eight-day forecast

17:23.009 --> 17:25.109
with Crispin Saint Chang.

17:28.048 --> 17:29.680
Jess did it right.

17:29.682 --> 17:31.582
She said something real.

17:31.584 --> 17:34.419
And I said "Sayonara, Sammy."

17:35.422 --> 17:37.488
Who the hell is Sammy?

17:40.827 --> 17:41.826
All right, man.

17:41.828 --> 17:43.061
I'm gonna take off.

17:43.063 --> 17:44.896
I gotta head to the station
before my dance gathering.

17:44.898 --> 17:47.031
You can't go to the station like
that. They'll make fun of you.

17:47.033 --> 17:49.100
When are you gonna stop worrying
about what people say?

17:50.203 --> 17:52.036
When I look into
my suggestion box,

17:52.038 --> 17:53.438
it is full.

17:53.440 --> 17:54.872
(laughs)

17:54.874 --> 17:57.408
People have a lot to say
about the way I live my life.

17:57.410 --> 17:58.609
But there is only

17:58.611 --> 18:00.611
one comment card
that I pay attention to.

18:00.613 --> 18:03.014
And you know
what that card says?

18:03.016 --> 18:04.949
It says, "Great job.

18:04.951 --> 18:06.451
Keep it up."

18:06.453 --> 18:08.586
And you know
who filled out that card?

18:08.588 --> 18:10.121
Me.

18:10.123 --> 18:12.457
You know how I know?

18:12.459 --> 18:16.027
Because I recognize my
motherfreakin' handwriting.

18:19.466 --> 18:21.766
Now that's
a Goosebumps Walkaway.

18:22.936 --> 18:24.469
I can do this.

18:24.471 --> 18:25.636
Right?

18:25.638 --> 18:27.271
Yes, I can do this.

18:27.273 --> 18:28.539
(phone buzzing)

18:28.541 --> 18:29.740
Oh, what...

18:29.742 --> 18:32.443
Hey, I was just
about to call you.

18:32.445 --> 18:33.945
Nick, look, there's something

18:33.947 --> 18:36.814
that I wish I would've said
to you last night, but I didn't,

18:36.816 --> 18:39.183
so I'm gonna say it right now.

18:43.056 --> 18:44.322
Sayonara, Sammy.

18:47.760 --> 18:49.327
Those are such beautiful words.

18:49.329 --> 18:51.129
I'm Sammy.

18:51.131 --> 18:52.930
(clears throat)

18:52.932 --> 18:53.965
Hello?
Reagan...

18:53.967 --> 18:56.501
I'm gonna need
some time to process

18:56.503 --> 18:57.935
everything you just said.

18:57.937 --> 18:59.103
Yeah.

18:59.105 --> 19:00.671
I really put myself out there.

19:00.673 --> 19:01.839
Yeah.

19:01.841 --> 19:03.608
I... Hey...

19:03.610 --> 19:06.144
in light of recent events,

19:06.146 --> 19:07.512
I think it's important

19:07.514 --> 19:08.779
that we have each other's
current information.

19:08.781 --> 19:11.449
I mean, I know
I have your phone number

19:11.451 --> 19:13.351
because I just dialed it

19:13.353 --> 19:14.952
and I have your address
because I lived there.

19:14.954 --> 19:17.021
'Cause Jess said it on TV.

19:18.791 --> 19:20.324
I've got a flight to catch.

19:20.326 --> 19:21.993
Me, too.

19:23.663 --> 19:25.029
Bye, Nick.

19:32.338 --> 19:33.704
(laughs)

19:35.842 --> 19:37.608
(sighs)

19:37.610 --> 19:39.010
We did it.

19:41.314 --> 19:42.680
(wry laugh)

19:42.682 --> 19:44.015
Thank God.

19:44.017 --> 19:45.383
Yeah.

19:45.385 --> 19:46.384
Need some sleep.

19:46.386 --> 19:48.386
Good night, buddy.

19:48.388 --> 19:51.055
So, we're totally free
to talk about anything.

19:51.057 --> 19:51.989
Totally.
Yeah.

19:51.991 --> 19:52.990
Like, any... thing.

19:52.992 --> 19:55.793
Any thing at all.

19:55.795 --> 19:56.861
Yes.

20:10.743 --> 20:12.810
Gah! What are
you doing here?

20:12.812 --> 20:14.212
Well, it's been six weeks
since we've talked

20:14.214 --> 20:15.413
and I was ready to talk.

20:15.415 --> 20:17.648
You and Gary
looked great on television.

20:17.650 --> 20:20.184
(sighs) Well, that's how
I want you to remember us:

20:20.186 --> 20:22.220
Blurry and talking like Zuul.

20:22.222 --> 20:23.654
Well, then,
mission accomplished?

20:23.656 --> 20:24.822
(chuckles)

20:24.824 --> 20:26.157
Hey, did Reagan
say anything to you?

20:26.159 --> 20:27.425
Yeah, she actually did.

20:27.427 --> 20:29.227
She said, uh, "Sayonara, Sammy."

20:29.229 --> 20:30.161
Does that mean anything?

20:30.163 --> 20:32.897
No, but whatever it means

20:32.899 --> 20:35.766
will factor heavily into
tonight's Nick-on-Nick time.

20:35.768 --> 20:37.168
I don't want to know

20:37.170 --> 20:39.003
what Nick-on-Nick time is.
Masturbating.

20:39.005 --> 20:41.405
Way more information
than I wanted.

20:41.407 --> 20:42.773
Everybody does it
three or four times a day.

20:42.775 --> 20:44.175
(laughing):
Three or four times...

20:44.177 --> 20:45.343
I'm talking about masturbating.

20:45.345 --> 20:47.178
(laughing)
But never am I

20:47.180 --> 20:48.546
fully into it physically.

20:48.548 --> 20:51.015
What? (giggling)

20:51.017 --> 20:52.617
I missed you, kid.

20:52.619 --> 20:54.819
Missed you, too.

20:55.788 --> 20:57.088
God, your nose hairs

20:57.090 --> 20:58.723
have gone totally bananas.

20:58.725 --> 21:00.391
I'm gonna get my scissors.
