Incoming traveller.

00:24.400 --> 00:26.320
Ah, Jesus!

00:33.800 --> 00:37.040
- Welcome back, SG-1 .
- Thank you, sir. It's good to be back.

00:37.200 --> 00:40.480
- You're overdue.
- (shouting) Bit of a wild-goose chase, sir.

00:40.640 --> 00:45.200
The remnants of a temple we discovered
led me to believe we'd found Kheb.

00:45.720 --> 00:48.520
The planet Sha're told me about.

00:48.680 --> 00:52.480
However, there was no sign
of Amaunet's Harsesis child.

00:52.640 --> 00:55.000
(shouting) Just rain.

00:55.160 --> 00:58.280
Much rain. Wind, lightning, hail.

00:58.440 --> 01:00.640
Did I mention the rain, sir?

01:02.120 --> 01:04.239
Report to the infirmary.

01:04.400 --> 01:08.560
I think we'd all like to change first.
I have mushrooms growing out of...

01:08.720 --> 01:13.120
Attention all levels. Stand by for
contaminated materials transfer.

01:13.280 --> 01:15.200
Infirmary. Yes, sir.

01:36.200 --> 01:39.240
- Infirmary?
- What?

01:39.560 --> 01:44.440
I'm escorting you as a safety precaution.
There's a big chemical spill on level 23.

01:44.600 --> 01:47.640
- What kind of chemical?
- Tetrachloroethylene ruptured.

01:47.800 --> 01:50.360
- Ruptured?
- The entire level's been sealed off.

01:50.480 --> 01:53.400
Hazmat team's cleaning it up now.

01:54.160 --> 01:56.880
- What?
- There's no danger, sir.

01:57.640 --> 01:59.560
Thank you.

02:03.760 --> 02:06.080
Loosen your belt, please, Colonel.

02:07.920 --> 02:10.800
How's a needle in my butt
gonna get water out of my ears?

02:10.960 --> 02:15.080
It isn't. Come on, sir.
You know this is standard procedure.

02:15.240 --> 02:17.560
We should rethink this procedure.

02:21.920 --> 02:25.240
So, Daniel, in our galactic meanderings,...

02:25.400 --> 02:28.520
..if we happen to stumble across
this Narcissus child...

02:28.680 --> 02:31.480
- Harsesis.
- We're still talking about a baby, right?

02:31.880 --> 02:33.680
- What?
- What?

02:33.840 --> 02:37.000
Attention. Contaminated
material transfer in progress.

02:37.160 --> 02:40.080
Please remain at yourpost until notified.

02:44.640 --> 02:47.200
Listen, really jam it in this time, OK?

02:53.480 --> 02:57.000
If Sha're's child is born
with all of the knowledge of the Goa'uld,...

02:57.160 --> 03:01.280
..it should be able to communicate
at a much younger age, right?

03:01.440 --> 03:03.200
Colonel?

03:03.360 --> 03:05.920
- Daniel?
- Just relax.

03:13.680 --> 03:15.600
Let's begin.

04:47.960 --> 04:50.840
(Fraiser) It has something to do
with the alien symbiote.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.520
It took an extremely large dose
just to sedate him in the first place.

04:54.680 --> 04:58.240
- What is the problem with the human?
- Her body chemistry has been altered.

04:58.400 --> 05:02.600
It is related to her prior infestation
by the dominant parasitical species here.

05:02.760 --> 05:06.600
- Is there a way to compensate?
- I have not found it yet.

05:06.760 --> 05:11.320
Place them in a holding cell. Once the
invasion is complete, study them further.

05:11.480 --> 05:16.520
Only then will we know if this is
a viable new home world. Come with me.

05:18.280 --> 05:20.600
Take that one first.

05:26.800 --> 05:30.440
Attention all levels. Contaminated
material transfer in progress.

05:30.600 --> 05:32.760
Remain at yourpost until notified.

05:32.920 --> 05:35.360
Contaminated material
transfer in progress.

05:42.200 --> 05:44.920
- 23?
- No, this one's going to 16.

07:34.640 --> 07:36.560
Teal'c.

07:36.720 --> 07:39.840
Major Carter, there is little time.

07:40.840 --> 07:43.160
Are you capable of standing?

07:46.520 --> 07:48.440
Oh. I feel sick.

07:49.480 --> 07:51.880
You are suffering from
the effects of a sedative.

07:52.040 --> 07:54.440
What? What's going on?

07:57.680 --> 08:02.520
- What the hell happened to them?
- They are not who they appear to be.

08:04.120 --> 08:06.840
There's been an alien incursion
within the SGC.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.280
A what?

08:08.440 --> 08:11.560
Dr Fraiser and General Hammond
spoke of a procedure...

08:11.720 --> 08:15.760
..which had failed to work upon
both of us. They spoke of invasion.

08:16.600 --> 08:19.160
Wha...? How does that add up to aliens?

08:19.320 --> 08:23.800
I saw two of them in their natural form.
Truly, they are alien.

08:25.920 --> 08:29.800
What about the Colonel and Daniel? We
have to know what's happened to them.

08:33.559 --> 08:34.720
(knocking)

08:34.880 --> 08:37.000
Come in.

08:37.159 --> 08:39.880
- (Carter) It's locked.
- It's not locked.

08:51.680 --> 08:56.120
- What about this chemical spill?
- I believe it to be a subterfuge.

08:56.720 --> 08:58.840
Not one camera's operating on level 23.

08:59.000 --> 09:02.720
- Incoming traveller.
- Try punching up the gate room.

09:06.280 --> 09:08.200
There.

09:25.080 --> 09:29.400
The O'Neill and Daniel Jackson we know
would not welcome aliens so blithely.

09:29.560 --> 09:31.480
Imposters?

09:34.760 --> 09:37.360
How do we know
we're the only ones not replaced?

09:37.520 --> 09:40.840
There's no way of knowing,
but if Hammond has been compromised...

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
Then we can't trust
anyone in the mountain.

09:56.680 --> 09:58.600
Alert General Hammond.

10:07.440 --> 10:10.160
The base was designed
to keep people out, not in.

10:10.320 --> 10:13.000
- If we can make it to the south gate...
- (alarm)

10:14.520 --> 10:18.040
- Our escape has been detected.
- We won't make it out this way now.

10:18.200 --> 10:20.760
I will purchase time
for you to depart this mountain.

10:20.880 --> 10:23.360
Keep 'em busy as long as you can.
I'll come back.

10:23.520 --> 10:25.840
Of that I'm certain.

12:12.800 --> 12:18.120
Airport shuttles are located in the blue
zone, hotel shuttles in the green zone.

12:24.720 --> 12:26.400
Maybourne.

12:26.560 --> 12:29.600
This is Major Samantha Carter.
We have a foothold situation.

12:29.760 --> 12:31.800
Major Carter? Where are you?

12:33.400 --> 12:35.320
I can't tell you that, sir.

12:36.800 --> 12:39.920
There's an outdoor cafe
outside NID headquarters.

12:40.080 --> 12:42.720
- In DC?
- Four o'clock.

12:42.880 --> 12:44.080
Uh...

12:44.240 --> 12:48.560
- I'm gonna need a little more than that.
- I repeat, we have a foothold situation.

12:48.720 --> 12:51.360
You're outside your appropriate
chain of command.

12:51.520 --> 12:55.040
I have reason to believe
that may be compromised, sir.

12:55.200 --> 12:57.120
Understood.

13:31.640 --> 13:33.920
Hey, Teal'c, how are you feeling?

13:38.120 --> 13:42.000
You, uh... went a little crazy on us,
so we had to sedate you.

13:42.960 --> 13:46.400
- You remember what happened?
- I do not.

13:46.560 --> 13:49.880
SG-1 was exposed to
chemical fumes from the spill.

13:50.040 --> 13:54.280
You became delusional and attacked
several people trying to escape.

13:54.440 --> 14:00.080
Teal'c... glad you're awake.
Has Dr Fraiser explained the situation?

14:01.200 --> 14:02.840
She has.

14:03.000 --> 14:07.520
Good. We're hoping you can tell us
where Major Carter is.

14:07.680 --> 14:10.320
She also had an adverse reaction
to the chemical.

14:10.480 --> 14:13.880
One of the side effects
is hallucinations, paranoia.

14:14.040 --> 14:19.440
Your symbiote protects you from a lot,
but apparently not tetrachloroethylene.

14:21.040 --> 14:22.880
Where is she?

14:23.040 --> 14:24.840
I do not know.

14:25.880 --> 14:30.320
Teal'c, if she doesn't receive medical
attention soon, she's going to get worse.

14:30.480 --> 14:32.800
I won't lie to you - she could die.

15:01.880 --> 15:04.440
- Hi. Can I get you some coffee?
- Please.

15:09.800 --> 15:11.720
Thank you.

15:12.440 --> 15:15.560
So, you came to the one person
you don't trust.

15:15.720 --> 15:18.680
I don't know how far up
the infiltration goes.

15:18.840 --> 15:22.560
It may be contained within the SGC, but if
General Hammond was compromised...

15:22.720 --> 15:25.440
He sounded fine to me on the phone.

15:25.600 --> 15:27.680
- What?
- He called me, Major.

15:27.840 --> 15:32.440
- Calm down. He's concerned for you.
- I told you we had a foothold situation.

15:32.600 --> 15:37.000
Major, a chemical spill causing paranoid
delusion is more plausible to me...

15:37.160 --> 15:40.600
- ..than aliens taking over the SGC.
- My God.

15:40.760 --> 15:44.680
You don't think I can tell
the difference between the two?

15:44.840 --> 15:47.280
- What was I thinking?
- Oh, hi, Carter.

15:51.800 --> 15:54.920
Maybourne, you are an idiot
every day of the week!

15:55.080 --> 15:58.280
Why couldn't you have
just taken one day off?!

15:58.440 --> 16:01.040
That's insubordination, Major.

16:02.680 --> 16:06.200
For crying out loud, Maybourne,
cut her some slack.

16:07.400 --> 16:10.640
- She's not exactly herself.
- And neither were we.

16:14.800 --> 16:18.360
Sam, believe me, I know what
you're feeling. It's the chemical.

16:18.520 --> 16:20.440
I don't believe it.

16:22.160 --> 16:26.520
All right. Exactly what are
the side effects of this tetrachloro...

16:26.680 --> 16:29.000
..ethyl mermaline stuff?

16:36.880 --> 16:38.480
Hallucination, delusion.

16:38.640 --> 16:42.520
- Paranoid delusion, I think, but go on.
- Look, I know what I saw.

16:43.080 --> 16:47.080
We were affected by the fumes
the moment we got in the elevator.

16:48.160 --> 16:50.520
Didn't even realise it was happening.

16:50.680 --> 16:54.480
I vaguely remember having
some water in my ear, that's it.

16:54.640 --> 16:58.640
- Dr Fraiser injected me with something.
- She was trying to sedate you.

16:58.800 --> 17:01.880
She didn't give enough to Teal'c.
He sprung you and off you went.

17:02.120 --> 17:04.119
He's fine, by the way.

17:04.440 --> 17:07.760
Beat the crap out of a couple of SFs,
but he's fine.

17:08.960 --> 17:11.280
We're telling you the truth, Sam.

17:18.839 --> 17:21.280
You should have followed procedure.

17:21.440 --> 17:25.319
I fully intend to return with you
just to make sure everything's all right.

17:25.480 --> 17:28.680
And you agreed to that?
Shouldn't that tell you something?

17:28.840 --> 17:32.320
I wouldn't tell them where we were
until they agreed to my inspection.

17:32.480 --> 17:36.360
- You have no idea what you're going into.
- I can take care of myself, Major.

17:36.720 --> 17:41.960
If I don't report back in a few hours, you
can rest assured that action will be taken.

17:43.200 --> 17:47.080
We just want you to come back
so Fraiser can check you out.

17:47.240 --> 17:49.800
- You're asking?
- We're asking.

17:55.040 --> 17:57.280
So, I have a choice. I can walk away now?

17:57.440 --> 17:58.520
- Yes.
- No!

17:58.680 --> 18:01.360
- Maybourne.
- You will accompany us back to the base.

18:01.520 --> 18:05.800
- If you resist, you will be handcuffed.
- No, she won't.

18:05.960 --> 18:09.480
This is very touching,
but this conversation in this public place...

18:09.640 --> 18:13.040
..is evidence that Major Carter
is something of a security risk.

18:13.200 --> 18:15.800
What's the matter with you?

18:18.560 --> 18:20.800
It's starting to wear off, isn't it?

18:20.960 --> 18:25.840
You're starting to think straight.
That's exactly what happened to me.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.960
I'm so tired.

18:31.360 --> 18:33.280
We're gonna go now.

18:33.440 --> 18:36.400
I'd like you to come with...
but it's up to you.

18:46.160 --> 18:48.360
All right.

18:48.680 --> 18:50.600
Sure?

18:51.120 --> 18:54.240
Good. Plane's waiting.

19:03.960 --> 19:06.280
After you, Major.

19:13.480 --> 19:16.600
Maybe you'll remember
something later, son.

19:17.880 --> 19:20.280
Please release me from these restraints.

19:20.440 --> 19:23.760
I'm sorry, Teal'c.
There's still a chance you could relapse.

19:23.920 --> 19:26.200
Three of the men you attacked
have concussions.

19:26.360 --> 19:28.280
(phone)

19:32.160 --> 19:34.480
Yes?

19:34.640 --> 19:37.200
You're certain she's been located?

19:37.360 --> 19:39.280
Very well.

19:41.280 --> 19:44.400
Then we may begin
experimenting immediately.

19:55.840 --> 19:59.440
Your tax dollars at work.
Cosy jet you got here, Maybourne.

19:59.600 --> 20:02.480
You've alerted General Hammond
to expect me?

20:02.640 --> 20:06.360
Oh, yes. He's awaiting your thoughts.

20:08.040 --> 20:12.040
- So how exactly is Teal'c?
- Oh, well, you know Teal'c.

20:12.200 --> 20:14.680
Is the chemical spill
completely cleaned up?

20:14.840 --> 20:18.600
As of this morning the Hazmat team
had gotten the last of it.

20:19.560 --> 20:24.720
But they're gonna keep level 23 sealed off
until they can figure out what happened.

20:27.240 --> 20:29.480
Carter? What are you doing?

20:31.320 --> 20:33.240
Don't move.

20:35.280 --> 20:39.120
- Put the gun down.
- She's hallucinating again.

20:54.760 --> 20:57.080
What the hell is that?

21:12.240 --> 21:14.080
Sit down.

21:19.520 --> 21:21.960
Look out!

21:33.840 --> 21:36.760
- Go check the pilot. He's one of mine.
- You first.

21:51.920 --> 21:55.640
Good enough?
I'll keep an eye on him. Go!

22:22.280 --> 22:24.200
General?

22:49.480 --> 22:52.680
- What is that?
- I don't know.

22:56.480 --> 23:01.160
- What is that damn thing?
- I told you I didn't know that Jack was...

23:01.320 --> 23:03.880
Tell us how that thing works.

23:19.280 --> 23:21.520
Sam.

23:24.120 --> 23:26.040
Hold on a second.

23:43.880 --> 23:46.200
So, this is how they look like us.

23:47.080 --> 23:49.800
Where's the real Daniel?
ls he still alive?

23:50.160 --> 23:52.760
You can talk to us now,
or to my colleagues later.

23:52.920 --> 23:56.720
Either way, we'll find out
the information we need.

24:09.800 --> 24:11.720
Sit down!

24:22.560 --> 24:24.880
(Daniel's voice) It works.

24:40.520 --> 24:44.640
It only creates an image. I couldn't hear
Daniel's thoughts or anything.

24:44.800 --> 24:49.000
- That must be what this one does.
- Put that thing down, Major.

24:49.160 --> 24:52.680
- What caused their images to blink out?
- They were just sitting there.

24:52.840 --> 24:57.360
Something interrupted both signals at
the same time. We should figure out what.

24:57.520 --> 25:00.080
We were levelling off. Uh, cabin pressure.

25:00.240 --> 25:03.760
This is electronic.
It was more like interference.

25:05.840 --> 25:10.960
Noise from the engines, maybe. If we can
replicate the conditions, we can find it.

25:11.640 --> 25:14.000
All right.

25:35.160 --> 25:37.760
- Sorry, sir.
- (gasping)

25:41.280 --> 25:43.200
What the...?

25:43.360 --> 25:45.280
Who's that?

25:45.840 --> 25:47.760
Major Davis.

25:48.440 --> 25:50.360
Colonel O'Neill.

25:53.720 --> 25:56.360
What's going on?
How did we get like this?

25:57.960 --> 25:59.840
You're asking me?

26:00.000 --> 26:02.080
(door opening)

26:57.400 --> 26:59.320
Hook him up.

27:26.720 --> 27:28.640
(squealing)

27:39.400 --> 27:40.720
Report.

27:40.880 --> 27:44.480
I thought the sedative
might be interfering.

27:44.640 --> 27:46.960
The symbiote is quite resilient.

27:47.920 --> 27:51.440
- So is he.
- Put him back in the holding cell.

27:51.600 --> 27:55.320
Major Carter's on her way back.
She may be less resistant.

28:26.080 --> 28:28.000
Davis...

28:28.640 --> 28:30.560
The latch for that thing is...

28:34.040 --> 28:36.360
- You found it.
- Yes, sir.

28:37.760 --> 28:41.920
If there's another Fraiser, my guess is
there's another you and me too.

28:42.080 --> 28:44.000
Why are we the only ones awake?

28:45.200 --> 28:47.520
Maybe, uh, maybe a malfunction.

28:51.560 --> 28:54.840
- Colonel, what are you doing?
- I'm gonna wake her up.

28:59.800 --> 29:03.480
- Do you think that's such a good idea?
- Well, it's an idea.

29:14.440 --> 29:16.360
(high-pitched tone)

29:18.000 --> 29:19.560
(tone stops)

29:19.720 --> 29:22.000
Maybe they didn't hear that.

29:32.000 --> 29:33.920
Excuse me.

29:39.880 --> 29:41.800
That was weird.

30:26.360 --> 30:29.080
A nice alien like you's gotta carry a...

30:33.880 --> 30:36.560
- Hello.
- What about the other thing?

30:38.760 --> 30:40.760
The other thing.

30:43.400 --> 30:45.600
OK...

30:45.760 --> 30:47.680
She's just an alien.

30:48.800 --> 30:50.720
Just an alien.

31:08.120 --> 31:10.400
Whoa, whoa.

31:13.280 --> 31:15.600
Yeah, that's an alien all right.

31:17.080 --> 31:19.880
Why don't you find something to tie it up?

31:20.040 --> 31:21.960
(door opening)

31:28.000 --> 31:30.400
Hello?

31:30.560 --> 31:32.480
Colonel?

31:34.160 --> 31:36.080
Yes?

31:36.800 --> 31:39.120
It's you?

31:40.240 --> 31:42.160
Yes.

31:44.680 --> 31:46.680
It's good to see you.

31:46.840 --> 31:50.560
Oh, my God. I figured they were keeping
you alive in order to access your mind.

31:50.720 --> 31:52.640
Whoa! Hey.

31:53.480 --> 31:56.200
- Who are you?
- Sir?

31:57.920 --> 31:59.840
Oh, sorry.

32:02.320 --> 32:04.600
Major Carter.

32:04.960 --> 32:06.880
Oh.

32:07.040 --> 32:09.600
Well, in that case,
it's good to see you, too.

32:09.760 --> 32:13.600
Every one of the people in this room
has been duplicated by the aliens, sir.

32:13.760 --> 32:16.000
Uh, noticed that.

32:16.160 --> 32:18.720
The procedure didn't work
on me or Teal'c.

32:18.840 --> 32:21.520
We escaped, but Teal'c's been captured.

32:21.920 --> 32:24.240
- Where's he?
- I haven't had time to find him, sir.

32:24.400 --> 32:28.160
- Maybourne's forces are moving in soon.
- Maybourne? How'd he get...?

32:28.320 --> 32:30.880
- I called him.
- Willingly?

32:31.040 --> 32:34.760
In 29 minutes those forces
are gonna break down the front door...

32:34.920 --> 32:37.880
..and shoot anything that resists.
We need to get our people.

32:38.120 --> 32:42.760
Yeah. I pulled that headband thing off
of Fraiser. Her evil twin came running.

32:44.120 --> 32:46.960
- Well, how did you two get free?
- We just woke up.

32:48.800 --> 32:51.400
That must have happened
when I killed you.

32:51.560 --> 32:53.200
I'm sorry?

32:53.360 --> 32:56.280
I killed the aliens
impersonating both of you.

32:56.440 --> 32:59.840
- And they don't know you did this?
- I don't know, sir.

33:00.000 --> 33:03.480
There's a specific tone
that will disrupt these devices.

33:03.640 --> 33:06.520
- The machine's in my lab.
- Go.

33:12.680 --> 33:15.680
- Sir, we're gonna need more weapons.
- Armoury.

33:46.840 --> 33:48.760
(high-pitched tone)

33:53.400 --> 33:55.960
Head on back to 23.
Keep an eye on our people.

33:56.120 --> 33:58.040
Yes, sir.

34:04.440 --> 34:06.760
I've come for the bald prisoner.

34:15.280 --> 34:17.280
You will come with me.

34:17.639 --> 34:20.199
I will submit to no further experiments.

34:20.840 --> 34:23.159
Oh, but you will.

34:30.760 --> 34:34.080
- I'll take it from here.
- I can't allow that, sir.

34:34.239 --> 34:36.159
Oh, but you can.

34:42.159 --> 34:44.080
Colonel O'Neill, I presume.

34:44.920 --> 34:46.840
What gave it away?

34:49.719 --> 34:51.639
(tone getting higher)

34:59.680 --> 35:01.600
That's it.

35:22.600 --> 35:24.000
General Hammond.

35:24.160 --> 35:26.080
(tone)

35:32.800 --> 35:35.440
General Hammond to the control room.

35:44.480 --> 35:46.400
(louder tone)

35:54.760 --> 35:57.080
- Sure you're up to this?
- As always.

35:57.240 --> 35:59.560
You're an animal.

36:12.600 --> 36:14.520
(alarm)

36:27.200 --> 36:29.120
(screeches)

36:50.760 --> 36:54.280
- What the hell was that?
- (Carter) Colonel! On your six.

36:56.560 --> 36:59.800
- What's going on?
- I don't know. They just ran.

37:00.680 --> 37:04.040
- Perhaps there's an evacuation.
- We can't let that happen, sir.

37:04.200 --> 37:06.120
- Why not?
- They've accessed our minds.

37:06.280 --> 37:08.480
They know everything about us.

37:08.640 --> 37:10.560
- Everything?
- Everything.

37:55.360 --> 37:57.280
Close that iris.

37:57.880 --> 38:01.840
I can't, sir. It's overridden.
I'm shutting down the gate.

38:12.320 --> 38:14.240
Everyone, freeze!

38:29.400 --> 38:32.000
(distorted sound)

39:12.560 --> 39:15.680
- What happened?
- They self-destructed.

39:15.840 --> 39:18.880
Their destruction appears to be complete.

39:19.040 --> 39:21.280
That's a lot of damage.

39:22.040 --> 39:25.000
Coat of paint... Iittle touch-up...

39:27.480 --> 39:29.400
It'll be fine.

39:31.640 --> 39:35.320
I've ordered P3X-1 18 locked out
of our dialling program.

39:35.480 --> 39:38.920
The human counterparts of those aliens
woke up spontaneously.

39:39.080 --> 39:41.640
We're assuming the signal
stopped when they left.

39:41.800 --> 39:46.600
Those who escaped still have knowledge
obtained from being linked to your minds.

39:46.760 --> 39:48.600
That's creepy.

39:48.760 --> 39:51.920
We've changed all our codes.
That's all we can do.

39:52.080 --> 39:56.880
How did this happen? The aliens came
through the gate impersonating SG-6?

39:57.040 --> 40:00.640
We rushed them to the infirmary.
We don't remember anything after that.

40:00.800 --> 40:03.000
Hammond asked me to come,
but wouldn't say why.

40:03.160 --> 40:07.280
Presumably their next step
after the SGC was the Pentagon.

40:07.440 --> 40:10.920
A high-frequency blast
every time a team returns...

40:11.080 --> 40:14.080
..should prevent it
from ever happening again.

40:18.040 --> 40:19.960
Colonel Maybourne.

40:23.200 --> 40:25.120
Good save.

40:26.440 --> 40:31.000
I thought you'd like to know the alien
posing as Dr Jackson expired.

40:31.160 --> 40:33.720
What of the aliens
not caught in the explosion?

40:33.880 --> 40:38.680
We're guessing they were linked
to their leader when he self-destructed.

40:39.000 --> 40:41.040
What about the aliens that escaped?

40:41.200 --> 40:45.600
We'll never know. We'll have to hope
the same thing happened to them.

40:46.760 --> 40:49.600
We appreciate your help
on this matter, Colonel Maybourne.

40:49.760 --> 40:52.760
Credit Major Carter. I do.

40:54.840 --> 40:59.000
Well, I'm, uh...
sure we'll see each other again.

40:59.240 --> 41:01.400
That'd be nice, Harry.
