WEBVTT

00:02.637 --> 00:03.696
<i>Previously on "Bel-Air"...</i>

00:03.796 --> 00:04.935
No one expects
you to jump right into

00:05.035 --> 00:06.613
the deep end that fast.
- I'm back.

00:06.713 --> 00:07.932
Yeah.
Yeah.

00:08.032 --> 00:09.850
I mean, no one
expected that either.

00:09.950 --> 00:12.328
My anxiety medication
is giving me more anxiety.

00:12.428 --> 00:13.886
<i>Weaning off meds
isn't something</i>

00:13.986 --> 00:14.925
<i>we want him doing on his own.</i>

00:15.025 --> 00:15.924
<i>There are side effects--</i>

00:16.024 --> 00:17.443
headaches, dizziness.

00:17.543 --> 00:18.921
So if you have any
stress or triggers,

00:19.021 --> 00:21.479
you have to come to us.
- Yeah, yeah. I promise.

00:21.579 --> 00:23.317
We could be, like,
the kings of Bel-Air.

00:23.417 --> 00:24.795
- Hey, Carlton.
- Hey.

00:24.895 --> 00:26.074
She's feeling you, man.

00:26.174 --> 00:27.393
Our paths don't
really cross naturally.

00:27.493 --> 00:28.911
Well, that sounds like
something I can fix.

00:29.011 --> 00:30.949
Is this the, uh--
the Black folk meeting?

00:31.049 --> 00:32.348
Look who's the president.

00:32.448 --> 00:33.706
There's a process,
Ms. Hughes.

00:33.806 --> 00:34.705
Here we go,

00:34.805 --> 00:36.903
the process again.

00:37.003 --> 00:38.741
- Ms. Hughes got fired today.
- What?

00:38.841 --> 00:40.779
I think that rallying
to save Ms. Hughes' job

00:40.879 --> 00:42.378
is a cause worthy of our BSU.

00:42.478 --> 00:44.096
- I agree.
- I think we should protest.

00:44.196 --> 00:45.774
<i>So we're gonna run</i>

00:45.874 --> 00:47.133
the plays that I call.
- Yo, I can win this for us.

00:47.233 --> 00:49.331
It's not about you, Will.
It's about the team.

00:49.431 --> 00:51.888
That fancy Bel-Air team
got you and your game soft.

00:51.988 --> 00:54.126
Tonight,
I'm showing the real Will,

00:54.226 --> 00:55.525
West Philly Will.

00:55.625 --> 00:57.083
There it is, Will.
Set it up, set it up!

01:03.497 --> 01:04.556

01:04.656 --> 01:06.194
Good practice, guys,
good practice.

01:06.294 --> 01:07.912
That's good work.

01:08.012 --> 01:09.910
Let's see if you actually
pass the ball in the clutch.

01:10.010 --> 01:11.748
Wow.
We're going back there?

01:11.848 --> 01:13.986
Yeah, let's look forward,
not back, all right?

01:14.086 --> 01:15.944
We live and die as a team.

01:16.044 --> 01:17.543
One more win and we're
in the state tournament.

01:17.643 --> 01:18.941
Hey, that's right, Coach.

01:19.041 --> 01:20.220
We're all about getting
the W, right fellas?

01:20.320 --> 01:21.219
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:21.319 --> 01:22.498
I'm glad to hear it.

01:22.598 --> 01:24.695
Well, we need to stay
focused, all right?

01:24.795 --> 01:25.694
All right?
- Yeah.

01:25.794 --> 01:26.773
- Okay.
- Got you.

01:26.873 --> 01:27.732
See you guys tomorrow.

01:27.832 --> 01:28.931

01:29.031 --> 01:30.090

01:30.190 --> 01:32.748
Yo, Ty.
Can I talk to you for a second?

01:34.426 --> 01:35.884
- Yeah, what's up?
- Look, man,

01:35.984 --> 01:38.482
you're supposed to be my ace
gunner on this squad, okay?

01:38.582 --> 01:39.920
So if you're against me,
who's gonna be with me?

01:40.020 --> 01:41.279
I'm sorry, Will, all right,

01:41.379 --> 01:42.917
but we called you
on the selfish shit last game,

01:43.017 --> 01:45.035
and then you just went out
and did it again.

01:45.135 --> 01:46.474
Look, man, I apologise.

01:46.574 --> 01:48.072
I just wanted to get the win,

01:48.172 --> 01:49.990
put us in the position
we're in right now.

01:50.090 --> 01:51.868
But we're about to go
to the playoffs.

01:51.968 --> 01:53.547
I want to believe you,
all right?

01:53.647 --> 01:54.626
But when the game
is on the line,

01:54.726 --> 01:56.264
can you really put
the team first?

01:56.364 --> 01:58.362
Look, you have my word.

01:59.481 --> 02:01.978
All right.

I hear everyone's all fired up
to go to your house.

02:26.534 --> 02:28.432
Yeah, you know,
we're, uh, turning the mansion

02:28.532 --> 02:30.070
into protest central.

02:30.170 --> 02:31.988
- Coming through?
- I was hoping to.

02:32.088 --> 02:34.226
You okay with that?
- Yeah, why wouldn't I be?

02:34.326 --> 02:36.464
I mean, I know
we're not together,

02:36.564 --> 02:37.463
but we're still cool, right?

02:37.563 --> 02:39.461
Oh, yeah.
Of course.

02:41.119 --> 02:44.456
The trophy they give out now
is way bigger than that one.

02:44.556 --> 02:46.054
Well, that's good.

02:46.154 --> 02:47.353
It's gonna look even better
when I hold it over my head.

02:47.353 --> 02:49.371
Everyone cheering you on
and--

02:49.471 --> 02:50.969
I can see it already.

02:51.069 --> 02:54.486
See, this is why
we just click, you know?

02:54.586 --> 02:55.964
You see, everybody else
around here would've

02:56.064 --> 02:57.323
gotten on my ass
about being too cocky.

02:57.423 --> 02:58.722
Oh, yeah?
Well, you're a little

02:58.822 --> 03:00.040
cockier than usual.

03:00.140 --> 03:01.319
You good?

03:01.419 --> 03:02.997
Yeah, I'm just being myself.

03:03.097 --> 03:04.496
Maybe it's time everybody sees
a little bit more of that.

03:04.496 --> 03:06.194
Right, the West Philly Will.

03:09.131 --> 03:11.309
That why you're so into
this protest with Ms. Hughes?

03:11.409 --> 03:13.827
Look, where I come from,
we look out for our own.

03:13.927 --> 03:15.665
Just 'cause I'm in Bel-Air,
that's not gonna change.

03:15.765 --> 03:18.822
Okay, but this is definitely
new territory for Carlton.

03:18.922 --> 03:22.498
Leading the entire BSU on
a walkout for a Black teacher?

03:22.598 --> 03:23.737
That's a lot.

03:23.837 --> 03:25.535
Look, Carlton will be fine.

03:25.635 --> 03:28.012
This is exactly what he needs
to get his swag back.

03:28.112 --> 03:30.130
Trust me?

03:30.230 --> 03:32.128
Look, I tried to talk
the BSU out of going through

03:32.228 --> 03:33.327
with the walkout,
but no one's gonna

03:33.427 --> 03:34.566
back down at this point.

03:34.666 --> 03:36.364
Everyone's all riled up now.

03:36.464 --> 03:39.001
Because they think
this is a game.

03:39.101 --> 03:40.880
Private school
students cosplaying

03:40.980 --> 03:42.598
as protesters for the day.

03:42.698 --> 03:44.696
Shouldn't you be on our side?

03:46.015 --> 03:47.193
I am.

03:47.293 --> 03:49.311
And as the faculty advisor
for the BSU,

03:49.411 --> 03:51.549
I'm advising you all
to think this through.

03:51.649 --> 03:53.867
You all have worked so hard.

03:53.967 --> 03:56.384
You've got such bright
futures ahead of you.

03:56.484 --> 03:58.262
Does this have anything to do

03:58.362 --> 03:59.701
with the Associate Head
of School position

03:59.801 --> 04:01.579
that they just announced?

04:01.679 --> 04:03.997
Let me guess,
you've already applied.

04:05.875 --> 04:08.572
Your name has come up

04:08.672 --> 04:11.769
in faculty discussions
about the Founder's Award.

04:11.869 --> 04:14.846
President of the student body
and the first Black student

04:14.946 --> 04:17.123
to win the school's
highest honour.

04:17.223 --> 04:19.441
You'd love that, right?

04:19.541 --> 04:20.520
Yeah, of course I would.

04:20.620 --> 04:22.318
Then shut this protest down,

04:22.418 --> 04:23.957
and find a way
to convince your cousin

04:24.057 --> 04:25.315
and the others
to get with the program.

04:25.415 --> 04:27.513
Yo, C, you, uh,

04:27.613 --> 04:29.032
ready to go?

04:29.132 --> 04:31.509
Uh, yeah.

04:31.609 --> 04:33.547
One sec, I just--
let me get my stuff.

04:33.647 --> 04:37.383
Will, I hear we're gonna
need to pull off an upset

04:37.483 --> 04:38.942
in order to beat Stratus.

04:39.042 --> 04:40.860
Yeah, they may be, uh,
ranked higher,

04:40.960 --> 04:43.198
but that'll make the dub
that much sweeter.

04:45.435 --> 04:46.774
Ready?

04:48.552 --> 04:50.730

04:52.548 --> 04:53.687

for tonight.

04:53.787 --> 04:54.966
What do you want?

04:55.066 --> 04:56.085
I wanna know what program

04:56.185 --> 04:58.282
Mrs. Bassin wants me
to get with.

04:58.382 --> 04:59.841
You heard that.

04:59.941 --> 05:01.939
Mm-hmm.

05:02.258 --> 05:04.316
Look, she's just concerned

05:04.416 --> 05:06.194
that we might not be accounting
for how embarrassing

05:06.294 --> 05:07.753
a walkout would be
for the school.

05:07.853 --> 05:10.031
Yo, they're
so scared of being embarrassed.

05:10.131 --> 05:11.669
They might as well just give
Ms. Hughes her job back.

05:11.769 --> 05:14.147
Do you really expect
the school to just cave?

05:14.247 --> 05:15.985
Well, they will
if our side sticks together.

05:16.085 --> 05:18.302
But for that to happen,
you have to stay strong, C.

05:18.402 --> 05:20.220
How am I all of a sudden
in the centre of this?

05:20.320 --> 05:23.457
Like, a week ago, I was
the Clarence Thomas of the BSU.

05:23.557 --> 05:25.136
You put us on
to fighting for Ms. Hughes.

05:25.236 --> 05:26.854
And that got you
your Black card.

05:26.954 --> 05:28.852
You gave the BSU
something legit to fight for.

05:28.952 --> 05:30.970
Look, C, this is about
you finally becoming the leader

05:31.070 --> 05:32.568
that you always wanted to be.

05:32.668 --> 05:33.847
And think about
your little sister

05:33.947 --> 05:35.685
and what she's going through.

05:35.785 --> 05:37.783
You want her to blame herself
for Ms. Hughes?

05:41.300 --> 05:43.298
No.

05:43.857 --> 05:46.514
Okay, you're right.
You're right.

05:46.614 --> 05:47.693
We're gonna go through
with the walkout.

05:47.693 --> 05:49.431
Okay.
That's my cousin.

05:51.210 --> 05:52.668
We gonna show this school
a thing or two.

05:52.768 --> 05:53.987
Trust me.

06:04.916 --> 06:06.414

06:06.514 --> 06:07.533
<i>♪ Buy me, buy me,

06:07.633 --> 06:08.512
I wanna be able
to see the banner

06:08.512 --> 06:10.810
from across the street.

06:10.910 --> 06:12.728
Pull the wrinkles out
before you lay it down, please.

06:12.828 --> 06:14.966
Uh, yes, ma'am.

06:15.066 --> 06:16.285
Take you back, Geoffrey?

06:16.385 --> 06:17.803
- Yeah.
- What?

06:17.903 --> 06:19.082
Mum used to boss y'all around?

06:19.182 --> 06:20.920
What?
I never bossed anyone around.

06:21.020 --> 06:22.598
They were always happy
to help me with my art.

06:22.698 --> 06:24.436
Right, Geoffrey?
- You don't know.

06:24.536 --> 06:25.995
It was a joy and a privilege.

06:28.732 --> 06:31.310
Ashley, you okay, honey?

06:31.410 --> 06:33.627
I just keep thinking
that Ms. Hughes got fired

06:33.727 --> 06:35.146
because of me.

06:35.246 --> 06:36.944
Ashley, sweetheart,
none of this is your fault.

06:37.044 --> 06:38.303
Honey, you can't
put that on yourself.

06:38.403 --> 06:40.420
We're here
to take this on together.

06:40.520 --> 06:42.418
Look, Ash,
don't stress, okay?

06:42.518 --> 06:44.576
When your school sees this,
they're gonna be so sorry

06:44.676 --> 06:46.095
they ever messed
with Ms. Hughes.

06:46.195 --> 06:48.333
Yeah, you gotta have hope
that justice will prevail.

06:50.630 --> 06:53.008
But what if it doesn't?

06:57.144 --> 06:59.322
Okay, if you wanna
help make protest signs,

06:59.422 --> 07:00.880
that's happening over here.

07:00.980 --> 07:02.259
If you wanna help write
our open letter to the school,

07:02.259 --> 07:04.277
you can join Yazmin
over at the table.

07:04.377 --> 07:06.434
Yep, we got enough pizza
and pasta for everybody,

07:06.534 --> 07:08.472
and, uh, you can help yourself
to whatever's in the fridge.

07:08.572 --> 07:10.191
But stay your ass out
the wine cellar, a'ight?

07:10.291 --> 07:12.189
If you wanna help
make some calls,

07:12.289 --> 07:14.067
reach out to other
students and clubs,

07:14.167 --> 07:15.426
you can head over to the couch.

07:15.526 --> 07:17.304
Yaz, am I missing anything?

07:17.404 --> 07:21.140
Um, well, I just wanna thank
each and every one of you

07:21.240 --> 07:22.179
for joining this cause.

07:22.279 --> 07:23.577
I mean, we need to stand up,

07:23.677 --> 07:25.655
not just for our teachers,
but for the books

07:25.755 --> 07:27.753
that depict
the Black experience honestly.

07:29.472 --> 07:31.130
Yo, what up, Ty?

07:31.230 --> 07:32.489
Yo, I'm here to help
with the protest.

07:32.589 --> 07:34.327
Okay.
I see you on your ally ish.

07:34.427 --> 07:35.645
Welcome to the party, man.

07:35.745 --> 07:37.164
Yeah, I figured you might
need my expertise

07:37.264 --> 07:38.642
since I've been in trouble
with the head of school

07:38.742 --> 07:40.441
more than anyone here.

07:40.541 --> 07:42.598
Also I loved Ms. Hughes,

07:42.698 --> 07:44.636
so I'm not about
to just stand by.

07:44.736 --> 07:46.115
That's what's up.

07:46.215 --> 07:47.394
Yo, real rap, we, um--

07:47.494 --> 07:48.373
we really appreciate
you being here.

07:48.373 --> 07:50.451
Of course.

07:51.130 --> 07:52.748
Uh, one second.

07:52.848 --> 07:55.466
I'ma stop a travesty
in progress.

07:55.566 --> 07:56.664
What the hell are you doing?

07:56.764 --> 07:58.143
Oh, uh,
I'm making some calls,

07:58.243 --> 07:59.262
trying to grow a coalition.

07:59.362 --> 08:00.900
Look, it dawned on me...
- Mm-hmm.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.818
That if we can get support
from the entire student body...

08:02.918 --> 08:03.777
- Right.
- We could win this

08:03.877 --> 08:04.976
before we even have to walk.

08:05.076 --> 08:05.935
Well, I have an idea
that's, like,

08:06.035 --> 08:07.454
ten thousand times better.

08:07.554 --> 08:09.532
Get your ass over there
and work in Yazmin's group.

08:09.632 --> 08:10.850
Oh, what,
you expect me to flirt

08:10.950 --> 08:12.648
while we're trying
to save Ms. Hughes' job?

08:12.748 --> 08:14.287
Pretty sure Ms. Hughes
believes in Black love.

08:14.387 --> 08:16.045
You know what I mean?

08:16.145 --> 08:17.564
Look, I'm just saying,
start some in her honour.

08:17.664 --> 08:18.922
You're ridiculous.

08:19.022 --> 08:21.200
Go, man.
You'll thank me later.

08:21.300 --> 08:22.599
Get out of here, pinky.

08:22.699 --> 08:23.637
You got this.

08:23.737 --> 08:25.236
Hey, Carlton, right on time.

08:25.336 --> 08:26.555
I have an idea
I wanna run by you.

08:26.655 --> 08:28.113
- Uh, yeah.
- Hey, Will.

08:28.213 --> 08:30.551
- Great. I'm all yours.
- You got a sec?

08:30.651 --> 08:33.208
Uh, uh, yeah.

08:36.844 --> 08:38.023
<i>What, am I in trouble again?</i>

08:38.123 --> 08:40.141
No.

08:40.241 --> 08:43.258
No, not at all.
Um, your aunt and I, we--

08:43.358 --> 08:44.537
we need your help, Will.

08:44.637 --> 08:46.854
It's about Carlton.

08:46.954 --> 08:49.132
You're aware he takes
medication for anxiety?

08:49.232 --> 08:50.690
Yeah, he told me that
a while back.

08:50.790 --> 08:52.089
Good.

08:52.189 --> 08:54.647
Well, you know, usually,
we respect his privacy

08:54.747 --> 08:57.364
when it comes
to this kind of thing, but, um,

08:57.464 --> 08:59.202
Carlton started weaning off
the medication,

08:59.302 --> 09:01.320
and we just wanted you
to keep an eye on him.

09:01.420 --> 09:03.717
Let us know
if you see anything off.

09:03.817 --> 09:05.316
- Off?
- Yeah.

09:05.416 --> 09:06.874
Well, I mean,
we're talking about Carlton.

09:06.974 --> 09:08.513
He's always a little off.

09:08.613 --> 09:10.910
No, seriously, Will.

09:11.010 --> 09:12.669
Um, what do you mean?

09:12.769 --> 09:15.426
Well, you know, just, like,
anything out of the ordinary.

09:15.526 --> 09:17.384
As far as I'm concerned,
there's nothing too small

09:17.484 --> 09:18.982
you could let us know about
at this point.

09:19.082 --> 09:20.301
Oh, okay.

09:20.401 --> 09:22.179
Well, if C needs my help,
I got his back.

09:22.279 --> 09:23.538
All right.
Appreciate that, Will.

09:23.638 --> 09:25.296
Yeah.
Hey, um,

09:25.396 --> 09:27.694
did you, uh, look into
the stuff I sent you about Doc?

09:27.794 --> 09:30.331
Yeah, um, yeah,
he seems to be involved

09:30.431 --> 09:32.609
in a lot of things that
could be helpful for you

09:32.709 --> 09:34.407
when it comes to basketball,

09:34.507 --> 09:36.205
but, you know, we gotta discuss
it with your mother first.

09:36.305 --> 09:38.083
But you all feel good
about it, right?

09:40.021 --> 09:42.838
We feel open to it, Will.

09:42.938 --> 09:44.557
Uncle Phil, come on.
I mean, the dude's legit.

09:44.657 --> 09:46.075
I'm not sure
he's the type of guy

09:46.175 --> 09:47.714
you need in your life
right now.

09:47.814 --> 09:51.030
Look, you've come a long way.

09:51.130 --> 09:52.709
We just don't want you to rush
into anything that's not

09:52.809 --> 09:54.747
gonna be in your best interest.

10:00.561 --> 10:02.659
Hey, Mum.

10:02.759 --> 10:03.778
Hey, baby.

10:03.878 --> 10:04.817
You have a sec?

10:04.917 --> 10:07.374
Yeah, honey, what is it?

10:07.474 --> 10:10.851
So it's been a couple days,
and I was wondering

10:10.951 --> 10:13.328
if you or Dad had anything
to say about Jazz.

10:13.428 --> 10:15.486
Why do you think
we have anything to say?

10:15.586 --> 10:17.364
Mum, come on.

10:17.464 --> 10:18.922
Don't act like Dad hasn't
said something.

10:19.022 --> 10:21.520
I swear he hasn't, but if
you want to know his opinion,

10:21.620 --> 10:23.718
you should ask him.
- I can't do that,

10:23.818 --> 10:24.996
'cause he's just gonna say,
Honey Bee,

10:25.096 --> 10:26.515
if you're happy, I'm happy.

10:26.615 --> 10:29.512
Maybe that's actually
how he feels.

10:29.612 --> 10:31.550
Listen,
your father and I decided

10:31.650 --> 10:33.228
after you and LaMarcus broke up

10:33.328 --> 10:35.146
that we were not gonna be
in the business

10:35.246 --> 10:37.664
rooting for or against
any of your boyfriends.

10:37.764 --> 10:38.883
You know y'all wanted me
to marry LaMarcus.

10:40.561 --> 10:42.699
And now you have nothing
to say about Jazz?

10:42.799 --> 10:44.257
I love Jazz, you know that.

10:44.357 --> 10:46.495
And Dad?

10:46.595 --> 10:49.052
I am not gonna be
the messenger between you two.

10:49.152 --> 10:50.571
Okay.
Thanks, Mum.

10:50.671 --> 10:53.048
But wait a minute,
I have a favour to ask you.

10:53.148 --> 10:54.487
After you just curbed me?

10:54.587 --> 10:56.165
Okay, favour is
the wrong word.

10:56.265 --> 10:59.102
It's more of a job opportunity.

11:01.580 --> 11:05.516
So you want me to give
a speech during the protest?

11:05.616 --> 11:07.354
What happened to the whole
open letter idea?

11:07.454 --> 11:08.553
People have short
attention spans

11:08.653 --> 11:10.151
for things that are important.

11:10.251 --> 11:12.389
They'll read three sentences
and then jump on Shade Room.

11:12.489 --> 11:14.267
We need them to stay focused.

11:14.367 --> 11:17.664
Okay, well,
as the president of the BSU,

11:17.764 --> 11:19.782
why don't you give the speech?

11:19.882 --> 11:22.419
Well, it's expected
coming from me.

11:22.519 --> 11:24.217
Got it,
but coming from me,

11:24.317 --> 11:27.094
it'd be such a surprise since
I'm the school's model Negro.

11:27.194 --> 11:29.612
Well, that's way harsher
than I would have put it,

11:29.712 --> 11:34.167
but you can't argue
with the logic.

11:34.267 --> 11:37.124
Look, Carlton, we're trying
to fight a system here.

11:37.224 --> 11:39.043
And I'm sorry
if that offends you, but--

11:39.143 --> 11:41.860
Look, no, I--I get it.

11:45.896 --> 11:47.674
I see why it'd be effective.
I'll do it.

11:47.774 --> 11:48.873
Really?

11:50.331 --> 11:52.329
Thank you.

11:55.886 --> 11:58.223
So Carlton and I are gonna
go draft the speech,

11:58.323 --> 11:59.302
but I'm sure there
are other groups

11:59.402 --> 12:00.621
that could use your help.

12:00.721 --> 12:02.539
Uh, is there
somewhere we could go

12:02.639 --> 12:04.497
that's a little quieter
where we could be alone?

12:04.597 --> 12:06.535
Uh, yeah.

12:06.635 --> 12:08.633
Yeah, follow me.
- Okay, cool.

12:09.872 --> 12:11.810
Wow, you actually went
to Minneapolis?

12:11.910 --> 12:13.608
Yeah. Yeah, my mum's
family's from there.

12:13.708 --> 12:16.165
So we flew up to protest after
George Floyd was murdered.

12:16.265 --> 12:19.442
That was, uh--that was intense.

12:19.542 --> 12:20.921
I had no idea.

12:21.021 --> 12:23.758
Well, yeah, you know
it happened during summer,

12:23.858 --> 12:25.436
and we don't really talk much
about it at school, so--

12:25.536 --> 12:26.515
Summer.
Don't you have all

12:26.615 --> 12:27.954
your track meets
and stuff then?

12:28.054 --> 12:29.792
Yeah, but you know,
you make time

12:29.892 --> 12:32.030
for the things that matter.

12:32.130 --> 12:34.028
I wish I could've gone.

12:34.128 --> 12:35.386
But my dad--

12:35.486 --> 12:37.224
Yeah, probably not
the easiest thing

12:37.324 --> 12:39.622
to convince a police chief
to go to a protest, so--

12:39.722 --> 12:41.340
No.

12:41.440 --> 12:42.859
It's okay.
There's--

12:42.959 --> 12:45.336
there's a million ways
you can fight the good fight.

12:45.436 --> 12:47.015
Drew is like clockwork.

12:47.115 --> 12:48.293
Every year,
he makes play for Lisa.

12:48.393 --> 12:49.532
Mm.

12:49.632 --> 12:51.370
Boy just keeps on
getting curbed, huh?

12:51.470 --> 12:52.889
Yeah, but who knows?

12:52.989 --> 12:54.727
I mean, before,
Carlton was in the picture.

12:54.827 --> 12:55.966
Then came you.

12:56.066 --> 12:57.324
Drew's a pretty cool dude.

12:57.424 --> 12:58.583
Maybe Lisa can finally
start seeing him now.

12:58.583 --> 13:01.081
Yeah, maybe.

13:01.181 --> 13:02.719
What, you still into her
or something?

13:02.819 --> 13:04.357
No, of course not.

13:04.457 --> 13:06.455
Okay, if you say so.

13:13.049 --> 13:14.228
Yo, what up, Lisa?

13:14.328 --> 13:17.025
Oh, um, James, right?

13:17.125 --> 13:18.943
Drew.
Close.

13:19.043 --> 13:21.101
Drew, right.

13:21.201 --> 13:23.538
Um, y'all finished
the banners out back, yet?

13:23.638 --> 13:25.097
Not yet, just taking a break.

13:25.197 --> 13:26.375
Taking a break?

13:26.475 --> 13:28.254
Okay.
Well, if you need some help,

13:28.354 --> 13:29.452
I'll show you how it's done.

13:29.552 --> 13:31.131
Got you, man.

13:31.231 --> 13:32.609
Yeah?
You paint, Will?

13:32.709 --> 13:33.808
Yeah, man, I'm pretty good.
Ask Lisa.

13:33.908 --> 13:35.406
She'll tell you about it.
- Mm.

13:35.506 --> 13:36.845
Well, Drew's gonna
help us out for a bit.

13:36.945 --> 13:38.044
You wanna join us?

13:38.144 --> 13:40.082
Join you?

13:40.182 --> 13:42.519
Uh, no, no.
Y'all got it.

13:42.619 --> 13:46.475
I don't wanna take up
too much space.

13:46.575 --> 13:47.554
All right.

13:47.654 --> 13:48.633
Keep making those signs, though.

13:48.733 --> 13:49.632
Will do.

13:49.732 --> 13:51.730
Got you.

13:57.564 --> 13:59.902
I'd give you full control
to curate all my work,

14:00.002 --> 14:02.020
and I'd give you
a competitive rate.

14:02.120 --> 14:03.498
What do you think?

14:03.598 --> 14:05.896
Mum, I would love
the opportunity.

14:05.996 --> 14:07.075
I just don't have
the bandwidth right now.

14:07.075 --> 14:08.214
Bandwidth?

14:08.314 --> 14:09.532
Wow, things are going
that well?

14:09.632 --> 14:10.651
Yes, they are.

14:10.751 --> 14:12.210
I actually have a meeting tomorrow

14:12.310 --> 14:14.847
about the house promoting
this new Simply Spiked drink.

14:14.947 --> 14:17.005
So yeah,
I'm kind of swamped right now.

14:17.105 --> 14:19.962
Yeah, I guess that's
good news, I suppose.

14:20.062 --> 14:22.000
You know what you need?
An assistant.

14:22.100 --> 14:23.239
Yeah.

14:26.935 --> 14:29.153
I think you're on to something,
Miss Bandwidth.

14:29.253 --> 14:30.432
Hey, Lisa.

14:30.532 --> 14:32.530
Can I talk to you for a second?

14:33.249 --> 14:35.247
That's a good idea.
That's perfect.

14:36.406 --> 14:38.463
What's up? Hey.

14:38.563 --> 14:42.100
Yeah, well, I've been
doing some thinking,

14:42.200 --> 14:44.018
and I really need
someone to help me

14:44.118 --> 14:45.936
with my upcoming art show.

14:46.036 --> 14:47.814
And I was wondering,

14:47.914 --> 14:50.212
would you be interested
in being my assistant?

14:50.312 --> 14:52.709
Oh.

14:54.428 --> 14:56.525
I guess that's a yes, then?
- Absolutely.

14:56.625 --> 14:58.244
Period. That's perfect.

14:58.344 --> 15:01.301
Pardon me, but, uh,
Ms. Hughes has arrived.

15:02.739 --> 15:03.998
I know.

15:04.098 --> 15:07.155
Mr. Banks was
equally surprised.

15:07.255 --> 15:09.193
Who invited her then?

15:09.293 --> 15:10.472
I'm so glad
you could make it.

15:10.572 --> 15:12.570
Oh.

15:14.048 --> 15:19.622
Seeing so many of my students
using their collective voice

15:19.722 --> 15:23.039
to fight for your principles,
it just--it fills my heart.

15:25.157 --> 15:26.575
I love you all.

15:26.675 --> 15:28.414
We love you too, Ms. Hughes.

15:28.514 --> 15:29.413
And that's why we're gonna try

15:29.513 --> 15:31.011
to get you back in class
with us.

15:36.346 --> 15:38.364
I will let you all
get back to your organising.

15:38.464 --> 15:40.881
And everyone,
good luck tomorrow.

15:49.013 --> 15:52.030
So I talked to Ms. Hughes
to get a little more insight.

15:52.130 --> 15:53.668
You think she has
a chance here?

15:53.768 --> 15:55.467
I'm not sure.
She said she was just

15:55.567 --> 15:56.705
trying to hold
the school accountable

15:56.805 --> 15:57.824
for what they promised
they'd do.

15:57.924 --> 15:59.343
Which is what?

15:59.443 --> 16:01.101
Update the curriculum
to be more inclusive.

16:01.201 --> 16:02.819
They just weren't
moving fast enough.

16:02.919 --> 16:04.178
So she found a way
to do it herself?

16:04.278 --> 16:05.617
Yeah, even though
she was well aware

16:05.717 --> 16:07.095
that the readings
on every syllabus

16:07.195 --> 16:09.892
were supposed to undergo
an extensive approval process.

16:09.992 --> 16:12.010
And she was warned--
several times.

16:12.110 --> 16:14.568
So this does not
look great for her.

16:14.668 --> 16:16.566
And some parents felt
the books weren't appropriate.

16:16.666 --> 16:18.004
And the extra credit
she chose to give out

16:18.104 --> 16:19.483
didn't help either.

16:19.583 --> 16:21.241
Even though she went
about it the wrong way,

16:21.341 --> 16:23.439
she clearly believed in it.

16:23.539 --> 16:25.537
And so do I.
- Yeah, me too.

16:26.855 --> 16:28.993
But all these kids, Ashley,

16:29.093 --> 16:32.110
they might be out there
fighting a losing battle, Viv.

16:32.210 --> 16:35.906
Or maybe they need
to find a bigger one.

16:42.040 --> 16:43.379
493

16:43.479 --> 16:45.577
Okay, we--we cannot
allow our beloved school

16:45.677 --> 16:50.412
to whitewash this crisis
of conscience.

16:50.512 --> 16:52.969
Mm.
That's a strong closing line.

16:53.069 --> 16:54.648
- You think it's too much?
- No.

16:54.748 --> 16:56.326
No, I think it's perfect.

16:56.426 --> 16:59.303
And I think you'll deliver it
like a king.

17:01.061 --> 17:03.279
A king?

17:03.379 --> 17:05.597
Thanks, I'll take it.

17:05.697 --> 17:09.193
But you know you're kind of
the queen of all of this.

17:09.293 --> 17:11.751
I mean, president of the BSU
is pretty damn cool.

17:11.851 --> 17:15.067
I mean, yeah, I suppose it is.

17:15.167 --> 17:17.025
But it's not really
about one person

17:17.125 --> 17:19.143
or one point of view, you know?

17:19.243 --> 17:21.821
I mean, just look
at all the incredible energy

17:21.921 --> 17:25.177
you brought to the group
just by showing up.

17:25.277 --> 17:29.253
It's pretty impressive.

17:29.353 --> 17:31.651
I'm just trying
to do my part.

17:31.751 --> 17:35.687
I know, and I appreciate it.

17:35.787 --> 17:37.325

Hey, Carlton--

17:42.740 --> 17:44.438
oh.

17:44.538 --> 17:48.194
Oh, uh, sorry,
I was just gonna tell you

17:48.294 --> 17:49.912
that Mum and Dad want
to talk to you.

17:50.012 --> 17:52.470
Y'all just carry on
as if I wasn't even here.

17:52.570 --> 17:53.948
Sorry.

17:57.845 --> 17:59.543
Um...

17:59.643 --> 18:00.782

18:00.882 --> 18:03.339

18:03.439 --> 18:05.697
Yeah, to be continued.

18:05.797 --> 18:07.055
<i>You should demand more.</i>

18:07.155 --> 18:09.173
Changing the curriculum
is a much bigger issue

18:09.273 --> 18:10.332
than one person's job.

18:10.432 --> 18:11.811
Absolutely.

18:11.911 --> 18:13.489
I mean, we had a petition
about this last year,

18:13.589 --> 18:14.888
and they just swept it
under the rug.

18:14.988 --> 18:16.366
Yeah, Bel-Air Academy
has to realize

18:16.466 --> 18:17.845
that they can't control
how Black we act

18:17.945 --> 18:18.964
or how real we are.

18:19.064 --> 18:20.602
Okay, but Dad,
what do you think?

18:20.702 --> 18:23.359
Well, it's really a matter
of focusing on a clear message.

18:23.459 --> 18:24.838
And I'm a fan of gathering
all the facts

18:24.938 --> 18:26.676
before rushing into action.

18:26.776 --> 18:27.915
And there's a lot
about this situation

18:28.015 --> 18:28.874
that's still not clear.

18:28.974 --> 18:29.953
But you do feel

18:30.053 --> 18:31.991
that Ms. Hughes
deserves better.

18:32.091 --> 18:33.229
What I think
doesn't really matter

18:33.329 --> 18:35.347
when it comes to the protest.

18:35.447 --> 18:37.105
This needs to be
a student-driven decision.

18:37.205 --> 18:38.304
Okay, then we're doing it.

18:38.404 --> 18:39.623
Look, we can
sit around all day

18:39.723 --> 18:41.021
and worry about
what might happen.

18:41.121 --> 18:42.740
But the point of a protest
is to let people know

18:42.840 --> 18:44.338
that there's a problem,
and I think we can all agree

18:44.438 --> 18:46.296
that Bel-Air Academy
has a problem.

18:46.396 --> 18:48.974
Exactly.
We can't cave now.

18:49.074 --> 18:50.612
Look how much energy
is around us.

18:50.712 --> 18:52.810
Everybody came out because
they wanna do what's right.

18:52.910 --> 18:54.608
We can't just stop now.

18:57.225 --> 18:58.244
That's right.

18:58.344 --> 18:59.883
Look, this is bigger
than Ms. Hughes.

18:59.983 --> 19:01.641
It's bigger than all of us.

19:01.741 --> 19:03.719
Changing the curriculum
attacks the problem

19:03.819 --> 19:06.037
on a systemic level,
not just a personal one.

19:06.137 --> 19:07.515
And...

19:11.291 --> 19:12.670
We're gonna take a stand.

19:12.770 --> 19:14.508
Yeah, that's right.
See?

19:14.608 --> 19:16.186
But we're walking out tomorrow.

19:22.680 --> 19:26.097
So, uh, I seen you and Yazmin
snuck away last night.

19:26.197 --> 19:27.535
What, y'all have
some protest sex?

19:27.635 --> 19:29.054
We wrote a speech, Will.

19:29.154 --> 19:30.492
Oh, speech sex.

19:30.592 --> 19:31.851
Okay.

19:31.951 --> 19:33.050
Y'all out there
speaking in tongues.

19:33.150 --> 19:34.408
I see you.

19:34.508 --> 19:35.967
Y'all nasty, man, I swear.

19:36.067 --> 19:37.165
Yo, what up, Ash?
You ready?

19:37.265 --> 19:38.364
Hey.

19:38.464 --> 19:40.682
Um, I just wanted
to give you these.

19:40.782 --> 19:42.800
- Wait, you're not coming?
- No.

19:42.900 --> 19:44.119
Just got a email
from the middle school

19:44.219 --> 19:46.316
saying no students
are allowed to protest.

19:46.416 --> 19:48.514
And if we do,
we'll be suspended.

19:48.614 --> 19:51.271
Damn, that sucks.

19:51.371 --> 19:52.310
Well, look,
I'm not backing down.

19:52.410 --> 19:54.408
Yeah, me either.

19:55.927 --> 19:57.585
I just hate that
I can't see it through.

19:57.685 --> 19:59.583
Yeah, well, you will

19:59.683 --> 20:01.941
because I'm gonna hang this

20:02.041 --> 20:03.419
right outside your classroom
where you can see it.

20:03.519 --> 20:05.297
Promise.

20:05.397 --> 20:07.615
Thanks, Carlton.

20:07.715 --> 20:10.332
May not be everything,
but it's something.

20:10.432 --> 20:12.430
That's right.
Keep your head up, a'ight?

20:13.669 --> 20:15.667
It's okay.

20:18.105 --> 20:20.103
See you at school.

20:23.140 --> 20:24.678
<i>♪ Money, money, money,
money, money, money ♪</i>

20:24.778 --> 20:26.556
<i>As you can see,

20:26.656 --> 20:28.394
But in addition
to each influencer's

20:28.494 --> 20:31.192
individual spaces,
I've designated these areas

20:31.292 --> 20:34.069
for group videos, where
we can cross-pollinate ideas

20:34.169 --> 20:36.027
and market
to each other's audiences.

20:36.127 --> 20:37.625
I've seen a few of those.

20:37.725 --> 20:39.224
Really loved the one
where you and Phanta did

20:39.324 --> 20:40.542
the culinary tour of Milan.

20:40.642 --> 20:42.380
Yes, I'm very proud
of that one.

20:42.480 --> 20:43.899
And we're just getting started.

20:43.999 --> 20:45.657
So what do you think
of the product?

20:45.757 --> 20:47.016
It's amazing.

20:47.116 --> 20:48.215
And I know when we put
our heads together,

20:48.315 --> 20:49.973
we can come up with some
great ways to market it.

20:50.073 --> 20:51.571
Okay, then.

20:51.671 --> 20:53.569
The new Simply Spiked Peach
flavour launches next month.

20:53.669 --> 20:56.726
So I just need to know, if
we do decide to move forward,

20:56.826 --> 20:58.325
would Ivy be willing
to participate?

20:58.425 --> 20:59.683
Of course she would.

20:59.783 --> 21:01.801
Does a collaboration
depend on that?

21:01.901 --> 21:03.519
It's just that
Simply Spiked would need

21:03.619 --> 21:05.238
to know that a partnership
like the one you discussed

21:05.338 --> 21:07.355
will reach
the right-sized audience.

21:07.455 --> 21:09.074
And Ivy's ten million followers
will make that

21:09.174 --> 21:11.511
an easy sell for me
with my bosses.

21:11.611 --> 21:13.270
Great.

21:13.370 --> 21:15.108
Great, let's move forward then.

21:15.208 --> 21:16.706
Wait, hold on.

21:16.806 --> 21:18.504
What do they mean,
"in addition to suspension"?

21:18.604 --> 21:19.943
What else can they do to us?

21:20.043 --> 21:21.741
It's all in the email
they just blasted out.

21:21.841 --> 21:23.380
Any student involved
with the walkout

21:23.480 --> 21:24.978
is gonna be suspended
from school

21:25.078 --> 21:27.415
and extracurricular activities indefinitely.

21:27.515 --> 21:29.773
Yo, this is some bullshit.

21:29.873 --> 21:31.252
We haven't lost
anybody though.

21:31.352 --> 21:32.410
Yet.
And with how hard

21:32.510 --> 21:33.929
the school's coming down on us,

21:34.029 --> 21:35.767
I don't know if anyone would
want to risk it for this.

21:39.184 --> 21:40.642
What?
Coming over here to tell us

21:40.742 --> 21:42.081
you're not gonna
protest with us?

21:42.181 --> 21:43.519
No.
We talked it over,

21:43.619 --> 21:45.557
and it's like Coach said,
we live and die as a team.

21:45.657 --> 21:48.474
So if you walk out,
we're walking out with you.

21:48.574 --> 21:50.512
A'ight, then.
I knew I liked you.

21:50.612 --> 21:51.671
My guy.

21:51.771 --> 21:54.908
Swim team and lacrosse
is still with us.

21:55.008 --> 21:56.227
Track team's still in.

21:56.327 --> 21:57.625
All right,
let's get back inside.

21:57.725 --> 21:59.144
I called an emergency
BSU meeting

21:59.244 --> 22:01.022
to decide if we should
still do the walkout,

22:01.122 --> 22:03.320
and I'm guessing every
Black student's gonna be there.

22:08.914 --> 22:10.912
Earth to Carlton.

22:11.592 --> 22:12.650
I see you, man.

22:12.750 --> 22:14.169
I know Mrs. Bassin
got in your head.

22:14.269 --> 22:15.967
Just remember, we have
to take a stand together.

22:16.067 --> 22:17.446
I get that.
I'm just trying

22:17.546 --> 22:18.844
to consider both sides here.

22:18.944 --> 22:19.963
All right,
let me help you out with it.

22:20.063 --> 22:22.041
On one side,
there's Black people.

22:22.141 --> 22:25.238
On the other side, people who
wanna hold Black people down.

22:25.338 --> 22:27.336
It's up to you to decide
who you wanna stand with.

22:37.845 --> 22:39.024
666

22:39.124 --> 22:41.142
No, okay?
We still need to protest.

22:41.242 --> 22:42.780
This is about more
than just Ms. Hughes.

22:42.880 --> 22:44.139
Drew's right.
If we back down now,

22:44.239 --> 22:45.338
then nothing changes.

22:45.438 --> 22:46.776
I'm not getting
suspended over this.

22:46.876 --> 22:48.455
Yeah, me neither.

22:48.555 --> 22:50.573
We're not gonna get suspended
for going to a protest.

22:51.711 --> 22:53.809
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

22:53.909 --> 22:55.927
The only way they can win
is if they divide us.

22:56.027 --> 22:57.086
Ain't no way they gonna suspend

22:57.186 --> 22:58.525
every Black student
from this jawn.

23:06.577 --> 23:07.995
Nah, Will's right.

23:08.095 --> 23:10.313
They would catch
way too much social media heat,

23:10.413 --> 23:11.831
more than they could imagine.

23:11.931 --> 23:13.709
Look, if we can point that out,

23:13.809 --> 23:15.667
I think we'll be
in a strong position

23:15.767 --> 23:17.586
to negotiate a deal
that's a win-win for everyone.

23:17.686 --> 23:18.864
Well, that's not exactly
what I was saying.

23:18.964 --> 23:20.862
Yes, we have the most
leverage right now.

23:20.962 --> 23:22.021
Mrs. Bassin, can you get us

23:22.121 --> 23:24.259
a meeting
with the head of the school?

23:24.359 --> 23:26.577
I'm sure he'll meet
with a small delegation,

23:26.677 --> 23:28.675
perhaps you and Carlton.

23:29.714 --> 23:33.450
Okay, so is everyone in favour
of committing to the protest

23:33.550 --> 23:34.928
so we can negotiate
with the administration?

23:35.028 --> 23:36.367
all: Yes.

24:01.682 --> 24:02.621
Thank you.

24:02.721 --> 24:03.620
Everything looking good?

24:03.720 --> 24:05.138
Yes, awesome.

24:05.238 --> 24:07.016
Thank you.

24:07.116 --> 24:08.455
Hilary.

24:08.555 --> 24:09.853
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

24:09.953 --> 24:11.492
Listen, I know you're
doing your photoshoot

24:11.592 --> 24:12.651
and everything,
I hate to interrupt,

24:12.751 --> 24:13.969
but I needed
to talk to you about--

24:14.069 --> 24:15.248
Oh, I'm okay for now.

24:15.348 --> 24:16.966
Thank you.

24:17.066 --> 24:19.564
I want to talk to you about
this deal that I'm working on.

24:19.664 --> 24:21.841
Uh, you said a deal?

24:21.941 --> 24:24.039
So like I was saying,

24:24.139 --> 24:26.357
I had this great meeting
with this marketing exec

24:26.457 --> 24:28.595
about a collaboration
opportunity for the house.

24:28.695 --> 24:30.793
I feel like it's the perfect--
- Uh, I'll do it myself.

24:30.893 --> 24:32.231
I don't want it too shiny.

24:32.331 --> 24:34.189
Oh, and for the next look,

24:34.289 --> 24:35.268
let's go with matte.
- Sure.

24:35.368 --> 24:36.707
Can you show me
what you have?

24:36.807 --> 24:37.886
Yeah. Here you go.
I have the palette here.

24:37.886 --> 24:39.224
Um, Ivy,

24:39.324 --> 24:41.462
can you just listen to me
for, like, five seconds?

24:41.562 --> 24:44.579
Girl, you came down here
in the middle of my workday.

24:44.679 --> 24:45.618
Okay, but when
I was hitting you up,

24:45.718 --> 24:46.657
you weren't responding.

24:46.757 --> 24:47.855
Again...

24:47.955 --> 24:49.214
Working, Hil.

24:49.314 --> 24:50.773
I'm working too,
and I'm trying

24:50.873 --> 24:52.091
to get our house
to the next level.

24:52.191 --> 24:53.570
So I need you
to pay attention

24:53.670 --> 24:55.768
when I'm talking about
this company, Simply Spiked.

24:55.868 --> 24:58.445
Oh, I love Simply Spiked.

24:58.545 --> 24:59.684
Thank you.

24:59.784 --> 25:01.882
Um, look,
I gotta go back to work,

25:01.982 --> 25:03.160
but I'll be done
in a couple hours.

25:03.260 --> 25:04.639
Let's meet later.
Sound good?

25:04.739 --> 25:06.277
- Yeah. Yep.
- Okay, bye.

25:06.377 --> 25:08.155
- Okay.
- See you.

25:08.255 --> 25:09.514
How's it looking?

25:09.614 --> 25:11.712
Oh, my gosh, I love it.

25:35.588 --> 25:37.246
<i>All right, appreciate it.</i>

25:37.346 --> 25:38.965
<i>Thanks again. Talk soon.</i>

25:39.065 --> 25:41.063
<i>Okay, buh-bye.</i>

25:44.339 --> 25:46.157
Geoffrey?

25:46.257 --> 25:48.275
Phil, what's up?

25:48.375 --> 25:50.273
Just getting up to speed
on a few things.

25:50.373 --> 25:51.412
I thought you were going
in to the firm today.

25:51.412 --> 25:52.871
Yeah, yeah, well,

25:52.971 --> 25:54.109
a few meetings got canceled,

25:54.209 --> 25:56.407
so I figured
I'd work from home.

25:58.086 --> 26:00.803
But now that you're here...

26:04.359 --> 26:06.537
Cohiba Behike.

26:06.637 --> 26:07.576
What's the occasion?

26:07.676 --> 26:09.674
A fresh start.

26:10.993 --> 26:12.171
You didn't have to do this,
you know?

26:12.271 --> 26:14.969
Yeah, I want to.

26:15.069 --> 26:17.147
I'm happy to have you home, brother.

26:19.264 --> 26:20.523
Thank you.

26:20.623 --> 26:23.480
Now, I hope you're ready
to get to work

26:23.580 --> 26:24.839
because I need you.

26:24.939 --> 26:26.937
Of course.

26:28.375 --> 26:31.552
James Lewis...

26:31.652 --> 26:33.150
there's something not right
with him at the firm.

26:33.250 --> 26:35.948
- James?
- Mm.

26:36.048 --> 26:38.665
You think you can trust him?

26:38.765 --> 26:41.182
Well, I mean,
I want to, but--

26:41.282 --> 26:42.501
get into it for me, will you?

26:42.601 --> 26:44.619
- I'm on it.
- Cool.

26:44.719 --> 26:46.937
And I'll put these
in the humidor for later,

26:47.037 --> 26:48.255
because you know
how we do.

27:11.332 --> 27:14.189
We understand
from your perspective

27:14.289 --> 27:17.906
it seems like
the administration acted

27:18.006 --> 27:20.223
hastily in firing Ms. Hughes.

27:20.323 --> 27:23.460
But we can assure you,
it's been a lengthy process.

27:23.560 --> 27:25.858
Mr. Hartwig formed
a DEI committee

27:25.958 --> 27:28.136
to review our curriculum,
which I chaired.

27:28.236 --> 27:30.533
And substantial changes
were made.

27:30.633 --> 27:33.510
All that is true, but
we still feel it isn't enough.

27:35.988 --> 27:39.005
Right, and--

27:39.105 --> 27:41.562
and look,
we understand your position

27:41.662 --> 27:45.918
and want to work with you
to find a solution.

27:46.018 --> 27:48.355
Look, we have a bunch of ideas
about how we can work

27:48.455 --> 27:49.594
to make our voices heard,

27:49.694 --> 27:52.671
but also spare the school
from some, uh,

27:52.771 --> 27:54.769
embarrassment about the issue.

27:59.404 --> 28:01.402
I'm listening.

28:03.600 --> 28:05.738
Listen up, everyone.
We've got some great news.

28:05.838 --> 28:06.757
We can go through
with the walkout,

28:06.757 --> 28:07.736
and no one will get suspended.

28:07.836 --> 28:09.734
Hey, all right.

28:11.952 --> 28:14.689
Also, the school has agreed
to review the policy

28:14.789 --> 28:16.687
that got Ms. Hughes fired,
and they're gonna start

28:16.787 --> 28:19.564
a curriculum review board
with student members.

28:19.664 --> 28:21.362
Nice.

28:21.462 --> 28:23.640
- That's a good start.
- Good job.

28:23.740 --> 28:25.738
Tell them the rest.

28:27.137 --> 28:29.155
Uh, yes, of course.

28:29.255 --> 28:31.413
Uh, we, um...

28:33.690 --> 28:36.667
We just also have to agree
not to make any signs,

28:36.767 --> 28:38.026
chant, or have any speeches.

28:38.126 --> 28:39.305
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- What?

28:39.405 --> 28:40.463
Whoa, they're trying
to put us on mute?

28:40.563 --> 28:41.862
It's a compromise, Will.

28:41.962 --> 28:43.341
There's a give and a take.

28:43.441 --> 28:46.258
Well, there's a lot of give
on our part.

28:46.358 --> 28:49.814
Silent protests can be
incredibly powerful, Will.

28:49.914 --> 28:50.993
Yo, what they're talking
about is not a protest.

28:50.993 --> 28:52.651
That's a fucking fire drill.

28:52.751 --> 28:55.848
It's the administration's
best and final offer.

28:55.948 --> 28:59.724
Reject it and they'll suspend
anybody that protests.

28:59.824 --> 29:01.482
Listen,

29:01.582 --> 29:04.360
it's all we've got,
and we're running out of time.

29:04.460 --> 29:06.458
We can still make
a powerful statement.

29:08.296 --> 29:09.435
Let's put it to a vote.

29:09.535 --> 29:12.052
All those in favour
of the compromise.

29:14.130 --> 29:16.128
Okay. Those opposed?

29:32.831 --> 29:33.690
839

29:33.790 --> 29:35.449
Will.
Will!

29:35.549 --> 29:37.526
Are you seriously
just gonna leave?

29:37.626 --> 29:39.524
Protests are supposed to fuck
with authority, Carlton.

29:39.624 --> 29:40.803
If they're okay with doing
what you're doing,

29:40.903 --> 29:42.841
then you're doing it wrong.

29:42.941 --> 29:44.080
Can't you see
they fuckin' with you?

29:44.180 --> 29:45.439
He's right.

29:45.539 --> 29:48.196
So why don't we play them
right back?

29:48.296 --> 29:49.235
What are you thinking?

29:49.335 --> 29:50.274
Uh, it doesn't matter

29:50.374 --> 29:52.991
'cause we already have a plan.

29:53.091 --> 29:54.709
No, see, I didn't want
to say it in there,

29:54.809 --> 29:56.747
but once they allow us
to walk out,

29:56.847 --> 29:58.865
they won't be able to stop us
from holding our banner

29:58.965 --> 30:00.304
or Carlton
from giving a speech.

30:00.404 --> 30:01.543
What, so you mean just, like,

30:01.643 --> 30:02.981
pretend to go along
with the compromise?

30:03.081 --> 30:05.938
I like that.
I like that a lot.

30:06.038 --> 30:07.337
So what do you say, Carlton?

30:07.437 --> 30:09.694
You ready to go viral?

30:09.794 --> 30:11.792
Come on,
we need you, Carlton.

30:14.350 --> 30:15.489
Yeah.

30:15.589 --> 30:17.527
Yeah.
Fuck it, let's do it.

30:17.627 --> 30:19.625
Great.

30:20.344 --> 30:22.282
Okay, let's, uh,
keep it between us.

30:22.382 --> 30:24.380
We don't want this to leak.

30:25.898 --> 30:27.357
See?

30:27.457 --> 30:28.835
We wanted to be kings
of Bel-Air.

30:28.935 --> 30:31.992
Now this is some shit
that they won't forget--ever.

30:32.092 --> 30:34.789
Yeah.
Dynamic duo, full effect.

30:34.889 --> 30:36.827
It's gonna be great.

30:36.927 --> 30:38.925

Girl, I'm telling you,
I'm trying to be here.

30:49.115 --> 30:49.974
It's been an hour.

30:53.791 --> 30:55.089
It's gonna be great.

30:55.189 --> 30:57.607
Ivy, are you serious?

30:57.707 --> 31:00.244
I'll see you guys inside, okay?

31:00.344 --> 31:01.363
Where have you been?

31:01.463 --> 31:02.841
We were supposed to meet
an hour ago.

31:02.941 --> 31:05.639
Right, uh, well,
these ad execs wanna pitch me

31:05.739 --> 31:07.876
their take
on the H2Ivy campaign.

31:07.976 --> 31:09.555
Can we make it fast?
- Yes, okay.

31:09.655 --> 31:11.633
We need to talk about
the Simply Spiked collab.

31:11.733 --> 31:13.711
I already told them I'd call
them by the end of the day,

31:13.811 --> 31:15.189
and I really do not want
to lose this opportunity.

31:15.289 --> 31:17.707
Yeah, uh, about that,

31:17.807 --> 31:20.184
didn't we agree
that H2Ivy would be

31:20.284 --> 31:21.383
the official drink
of the house?

31:21.483 --> 31:23.421
Agree?
No one agreed to anything.

31:23.521 --> 31:25.419
There was no agreeing.
You didn't even ask me.

31:25.519 --> 31:26.777
Okay, well,
it doesn't matter,

31:26.877 --> 31:28.855
because I talked to my lawyers,

31:28.955 --> 31:31.333
and they've advised me not
to endorse the competition.

31:31.433 --> 31:33.771
The competition?

31:33.871 --> 31:35.009
Ivy, be for real.

31:35.109 --> 31:37.207
What?

31:37.307 --> 31:40.484
Simply Spiked is
an international brand.

31:40.584 --> 31:42.442
No one even knows
what H2Ivy is.

31:42.542 --> 31:44.160
That's not true.

31:44.260 --> 31:48.875
Okay, they're talking
about a billboard on Sunset.

31:48.975 --> 31:50.274
Okay, that's great for you,
but this opportunity

31:50.374 --> 31:52.032
is great for the house.

31:52.132 --> 31:54.630
I mean, Simply Spiked basically
already agreed to be partners.

31:54.730 --> 31:56.028
Well, I didn't.

31:56.128 --> 31:57.627
So you're gonna have
to find somebody else,

31:57.727 --> 32:00.244
because I don't want
to do it, period.

32:01.643 --> 32:02.822
I gotta go.

best to look at the problem

33:14.770 --> 33:16.108
You coming?

33:16.208 --> 33:18.226
Hell yeah.

33:32.672 --> 33:34.610
Yeah, um,
I kind of can't believe it.

33:34.710 --> 33:36.248
But, um, look,
it wasn't just me, all right?

33:36.348 --> 33:37.727
The rest of the BSU
deserves the credit.

33:37.827 --> 33:39.445
All right, everybody's here.

33:39.545 --> 33:40.564
Time for some devious shit.

33:40.664 --> 33:42.043
Shut up, Will.
Just be patient.

33:42.143 --> 33:43.201
What are y'all
talking about?

33:43.301 --> 33:44.280
Nothing.
Um, hey, everyone.

33:44.380 --> 33:45.919
This is amazing.

33:46.019 --> 33:47.597
Well, we got good
participation, yeah.

33:47.697 --> 33:49.315
But, um, what exactly

33:49.415 --> 33:50.834
are we supposed to do,
just stand around?

33:50.934 --> 33:53.551
Uh, just take lots
of pictures and videos.

33:53.651 --> 33:54.910
All right,
all these people are gonna make

33:55.010 --> 33:56.708
a huge impression
once we post about this.

33:56.808 --> 33:59.026
For an isosceles triangle,

33:59.126 --> 34:01.303
the area can be easily
calculated if the height--

34:01.403 --> 34:03.661
<i>So we hope that seeing all
these students out here</i>

34:03.761 --> 34:06.498
<i>rallying behind former
Bel-Air Academy teacher,</i>

34:06.598 --> 34:09.735
Ms. Donette Hughes,
inspires you to use your voice

34:09.835 --> 34:11.933
and rally
for her reinstatement.

34:12.033 --> 34:14.031
Um, thank you so much
for your support.

34:15.070 --> 34:17.008
Uh, okay.

34:17.108 --> 34:18.566
Yeah, I fe--I feel really,
really good about that.

34:18.666 --> 34:19.725
That video
was boring as fuck.

34:19.825 --> 34:21.323
- Drew.
- Yo, Tyler.

34:21.423 --> 34:23.201
Get a picture of this.
- We promised no signs, Will.

34:23.301 --> 34:24.280
Yeah, yeah, I got you.
I'll post this.

34:24.380 --> 34:26.278
My guy. Big ally tings.

34:28.576 --> 34:30.954
Shit. Uh, excuse me.

34:31.054 --> 34:32.392
Are you serious?

34:32.492 --> 34:34.151
Look, you should be
getting that on camera.

34:34.251 --> 34:35.669
- Come on.
- What are you doing?

34:35.769 --> 34:37.028
- Uh--
- We said no signs.

34:37.128 --> 34:38.746
Y-yeah, just, um,

34:38.846 --> 34:40.544
um, uh, my--
my phone's just messed up--

34:40.644 --> 34:42.063
Seriously?
Yeah, I got it.

34:42.163 --> 34:43.501
Give me the banner.

34:47.517 --> 34:49.096
Carlton!

34:53.711 --> 34:54.770
Carlton!

34:54.870 --> 34:55.969
Did you see that?

34:56.069 --> 34:57.287
They took away the banner.

34:57.387 --> 34:59.385
But you can still
do the speech.

35:00.424 --> 35:02.203
- Speech?
- Yeah, like we talked about.

35:02.303 --> 35:03.961
Just jump up on a table
and start talking.

35:04.061 --> 35:05.559
- That's a great idea.
- Yeah.

35:05.659 --> 35:07.797
Even if they drag you away,
just--we'll just record it,

35:07.897 --> 35:08.916
and it'll have the same effect.

35:09.016 --> 35:10.514
Carlton,
what are you waiting for?

35:10.614 --> 35:12.113
- You could totally do that.
- Uh, okay.

35:12.213 --> 35:13.431
Okay, yeah.
- So--

35:13.531 --> 35:15.190
Yeah, just--uh,
just give me a second, okay?

35:15.290 --> 35:16.588
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

35:20.045 --> 35:21.783
Just--just give me a second.

35:21.883 --> 35:22.942
Just--fuck.

35:23.042 --> 35:24.900
- Carlton, where are you--
- Please.

35:25.000 --> 35:27.777
What the hell
is wrong with him?

35:38.626 --> 35:40.804
<i>Carlton, we're trying
to fight a system here.</i>

35:40.904 --> 35:42.243
<i>Founder's Award.</i>

35:42.343 --> 35:43.881

that they won't forget.</i>

35:43.981 --> 35:46.119
Yo, C!

35:46.219 --> 35:48.876
What happened to all the signs
and the speeches and all that?

35:48.976 --> 35:50.434
- I can't.
- What do you mean, you can't?

35:50.534 --> 35:52.752
I can't do
the fucking speech, Will.

35:52.852 --> 35:53.731
Carlton, we have
all these people

35:53.731 --> 35:54.870
out here waiting for something.

35:54.970 --> 35:56.628
You better not fucking
tell Mum and Dad.

35:56.728 --> 35:58.466
Okay? Please,
I'm letting everyone down.

35:58.566 --> 36:00.504
I--okay?

36:00.604 --> 36:02.902
Okay.

36:03.002 --> 36:06.898
Carlton, look,
it's gonna be all right, okay?

36:06.998 --> 36:08.496
I got you.

36:08.596 --> 36:10.375
Just breathe.

36:10.475 --> 36:11.573
Just breathe.

36:22.582 --> 36:24.680
Fuck.

36:24.780 --> 36:25.919
All right, everyone.

36:26.019 --> 36:28.956
