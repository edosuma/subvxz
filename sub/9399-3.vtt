00:17.884 --> 00:18.908
<i>Recently, we've come home.</i>

00:18.985 --> 00:21.249
I missed you, P. Sawyer.

00:50.483 --> 00:52.075
I am here.

00:52.185 --> 00:57.680
One more night like this, Nathan,
and I promise you, you will have nothing.

01:40.266 --> 01:43.463
Wow. Did you write all night?

01:45.939 --> 01:48.965
Yeah. I guess I did.

01:49.042 --> 01:53.604
The question is, how much of it survived
the dreaded delete button?

01:54.647 --> 01:57.844
- Almost all of it.
- You must be ready to pass out.

02:00.753 --> 02:04.086
Actually, I'm not tired.
I'm really energized.

02:04.757 --> 02:08.920
You know, it just came to me.
I haven't felt this inspired since...

02:11.131 --> 02:13.122
Since my last book.

02:14.134 --> 02:18.434
I'm glad.
And it's a good thing you're energized.

02:22.742 --> 02:25.575
Because you have practice in,
like, eight minutes.

02:27.514 --> 02:30.347
- Off you go, coach.
- That was just mean.

02:30.416 --> 02:32.509
You're a mean person.

02:32.585 --> 02:34.382
You know that? Yeah.

Sorry, Haley's not here, she's at school.

03:05.718 --> 03:07.948
- I'm Carrie, the new...
- The new nanny.

03:08.021 --> 03:09.784
I know, she told me.

03:09.856 --> 03:13.622
Okay. Well, I'm gonna make breakfast.
Do you want me to bring you some?

03:13.693 --> 03:15.490
No, I'm good, thanks.

03:24.470 --> 03:26.233

but I think you're having fun. Admit it.

03:37.450 --> 03:40.180
Well, I'll admit that I'm enjoying

03:40.253 --> 03:41.242
(DRILLING)

03:43.389 --> 03:47.519

03:52.465 --> 03:55.764
Speak of the devil. She's on the other line.
Of course.

03:55.835 --> 03:57.769
Well, good thing you're already in hell.

03:57.837 --> 03:59.998
- Call me later.
- Okay.

04:03.343 --> 04:05.538
I was just about to call you.

04:05.612 --> 04:09.673
No, you weren't. Why haven't I received
your flight itinerary?

04:09.749 --> 04:12.582
<i>Because I've decided to stay</i>
<i>in Tree Hill a few extra days.</i>

04:12.652 --> 04:14.711
We're opening a new store.

04:15.822 --> 04:17.915
I didn't approve a Tree Hill location.

04:17.991 --> 04:20.084
- Well...
<i>- That doesn't even make sense.</i>

04:20.159 --> 04:22.855
Brooke Davis,
you are jeopardizing this company.

04:22.929 --> 04:27.161
<i>You're the face of the brand, and your</i>
<i>absence can cause irreparable harm.</i>

04:27.233 --> 04:29.667
Now what the hell has gotten into you?

04:29.736 --> 04:32.102
- Home.
- Are you doing drugs?

04:33.172 --> 04:36.539
Because if you are, it's okay.
I can spin this in a good way.

04:36.609 --> 04:40.340
- I have to go.
- Brooke. Brooke.

04:40.413 --> 04:45.715
Excuse me, we're gonna keep this.
This belongs here.

04:53.860 --> 04:58.422
- Did you just walk down the stairs?
- Lf by walking you mean falling.

04:58.865 --> 05:02.266
You didn't have to come down.
I told you I'd bring you some breakfast.

05:02.335 --> 05:04.997
- What is that?
- Bacon and eggs.

05:06.539 --> 05:08.632
Yes, it's rearranged into a smiley face.

05:08.708 --> 05:12.804
- I do that sometimes. I'm an optimist.
- Whatever.

05:12.879 --> 05:14.938
Listen, I need you
to give me a ride somewhere.

05:15.181 --> 05:17.240
- Do nannies do that?
- Sure.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.649
I don't have to pick up Jamie
for a few hours.

05:19.719 --> 05:23.712
Just let me get your crutches.
And no more falling.

05:34.634 --> 05:36.966
QUENTIN: Hey, pick it up, blue. Let's go.

05:37.603 --> 05:39.230
Hey, coach, got a sec?

05:39.305 --> 05:41.136
Well, that depends.
Are you gonna be one of those teachers

05:41.207 --> 05:42.697
constantly complaining
about my players' grades?

05:42.775 --> 05:45.243
If your players are failing,
you bet your ass I will.

05:45.311 --> 05:49.111
Fair enough. Grades are the least
of this team's worries.

05:50.183 --> 05:52.674
Oh, my God. Can't be serious.

05:52.752 --> 05:54.379
Hey, how's Quentin?
Is he still disrupting the class?

05:54.454 --> 05:57.446
Actually, no,
Quentin has not been in class all week,

05:57.523 --> 05:59.514
and I think it's because
he got kicked off the team.

05:59.592 --> 06:01.617
You can't save them all, Hales.

06:02.462 --> 06:03.486
Come on.

06:03.563 --> 06:05.497
God.

06:06.099 --> 06:10.229
- I think your team looks really good.
- The JV's the team in white.

06:10.303 --> 06:11.964
In the blue? Yeah, those are mine.

06:12.372 --> 06:13.771
Really, a work in progress.

06:13.840 --> 06:16.968
Awkward. Okay, I'm gonna go
to class now. See you later.

06:17.543 --> 06:20.137
Haley, how's my little brother doing?

06:21.047 --> 06:23.015
He's a work in progress.

06:26.185 --> 06:27.447
Finish!

06:28.254 --> 06:31.553
Excuse me. I found my demo in the trash.

06:32.425 --> 06:35.053
Perhaps you should have left it there.

06:35.995 --> 06:37.656
I don't think so.

06:38.231 --> 06:41.667
Excuse me? What did you just say?

06:41.734 --> 06:44.464
Look, maybe I'm not right
for the job, okay,

06:44.537 --> 06:47.404
but my audition demo
doesn't belong in the trash.

06:47.473 --> 06:49.566
I worked really hard on it.

06:51.310 --> 06:56.373
You're right.
That was a mistake, and I'm sorry.

06:59.786 --> 07:02.516
I meant to put it in the recycling bin.

07:03.589 --> 07:06.922
Yo, Mouth. It's early lunch Thursday.

07:07.960 --> 07:11.691
Friends at work.
That's half a strike, at least.

07:12.565 --> 07:14.897
Thanks. Nice timing, by the way.

07:27.079 --> 07:28.569
Hello, Nathan.

07:35.421 --> 07:40.017
<i>GUARD ON PA: Inmate Caspar to Culinary.</i>
<i>Inmate Caspar to Culinary.</i>

07:41.027 --> 07:44.019
It's good to see you, Nathan.
Been a long time.

07:45.364 --> 07:46.797
Four years.

07:46.866 --> 07:49.391
Four years, fifteen weeks, two days.

07:50.970 --> 07:53.939
Counting the days is
kind of a popular hobby around here.

07:54.006 --> 07:55.769
That, and ceramics.

07:59.278 --> 08:01.371
Tell me about the accident.

08:03.783 --> 08:05.774
It was a moment of anger.

08:06.319 --> 08:09.413
I had a chance to walk away,
and I didn't do it.

08:10.423 --> 08:15.190
And now my punishment is I get to regret
it every day for the rest of my life.

08:15.595 --> 08:17.085
Join the club.

08:17.964 --> 08:21.923
My biggest regret's not being able
to watch my grandson grow up.

08:22.068 --> 08:23.695
Losing my family.

08:24.604 --> 08:26.970
Those are things you still have.

08:29.141 --> 08:32.508
How is my grandson?
Must be getting big by now.

08:32.712 --> 08:36.511
- You got a picture of him?
- I'm not here to talk about Jamie.

08:37.482 --> 08:42.385
I understand. I just always wondered
if he knows who I am.

08:44.457 --> 08:46.755
He found a picture of you once.

08:47.894 --> 08:50.590
Told him that you were his grandfather.

08:52.298 --> 08:54.289
He asked where you were.

08:54.734 --> 08:56.531
What'd you tell him?

08:57.436 --> 08:59.336
Told him you were dead.

09:06.746 --> 09:08.213
Can I help you with something?

09:08.281 --> 09:14.117
Hi. Sorry, no, I'm just... Thought I would
lounge here while I'm on my break.

09:14.186 --> 09:16.882
Well, you know, they do have
a teacher's lounge for that, right?

09:16.956 --> 09:18.719
Luke, it's so creepy in there.

09:18.791 --> 09:21.259
They're all acting like
they're still my teachers.

09:21.327 --> 09:24.421
- I feel like I'm being graded.
- You, too, huh?

09:24.497 --> 09:28.695
Yeah. So I hear you rented out
your office space at Tric to Peyton.

09:29.268 --> 09:31.896
- Lindsey okay with that?
- Yeah, why not?

09:33.306 --> 09:36.036
I don't know. Maybe because Peyton's
not just another ex-girlfriend,

09:36.108 --> 09:37.700
and everybody knows that.

09:37.777 --> 09:40.905
Haley, I'm just helping out
an old friend, okay? That's all.

09:40.980 --> 09:44.143
Besides, you know,
Lindsey's not really the jealous type.

09:44.951 --> 09:48.910
Good answer. Because I'm having lunch
with her in a few minutes.

09:50.556 --> 09:54.515
So what, this was just a sneak attack?
You're just gathering information.

09:54.594 --> 09:57.654
- Yeah, pretty much.
- How did I not see this coming?

09:58.230 --> 10:02.963
Because you're a guy, Luke,
and guys are so predictable.

10:03.936 --> 10:05.904
QUENTIN: Girls are so predictable.

10:05.972 --> 10:08.065
She's not a girl, she's a woman.

10:08.140 --> 10:09.505
She is a cougar.

10:09.575 --> 10:12.476
Whatever she is, she hates me.
And it's getting worse every day.

10:12.545 --> 10:15.571
- That's called sexual tension, dawg.
- You need to stay off the Internet.

10:15.648 --> 10:18.947
No, I'm serious.
Look, last year I had this professor, right?

10:19.018 --> 10:21.486
She kept on riding me
all semester though, dawg.

10:21.554 --> 10:23.249
I mean and not in a good way.

10:23.322 --> 10:26.655
So one day
she starts bitching at me after class,

10:26.726 --> 10:28.421
I planted one on her.

10:28.494 --> 10:30.928
You did not. There's no way you did that.

10:30.997 --> 10:33.830
That's not all I did.
I'm telling you, hook it up.

10:33.899 --> 10:36.129
You have finally lost touch with reality.

10:36.202 --> 10:38.500
Oh, and by the way, next time
you decide to stop by my work,

10:38.571 --> 10:41.369
try not to yell out, "Early lunch Thursday."

10:41.507 --> 10:43.634
Okay. I'm telling you.

10:44.110 --> 10:47.375
I think you gonna miss out
on some hot cougar love.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.479
(GROWLING LIKE A CAT)

10:51.083 --> 10:53.574
Remember the first time
you invited me to lunch here?

10:53.653 --> 10:54.915
Yeah. Oh, thank you.

10:54.987 --> 10:57.114
You said you wanted
to get to know me better,

10:57.189 --> 10:59.589
but I knew right away
you were just sizing me up.

10:59.659 --> 11:01.820
Oh, I was not.

11:01.894 --> 11:06.194
Haley, you asked me to bring
a photocopy of my driver's license.

11:06.265 --> 11:09.234
Well, I was just, you know, checking
to make sure you were good enough

11:09.301 --> 11:13.795
for my best friend. I mean, Lucas
had been through a lot lately, you know.

11:14.407 --> 11:18.002
- Lucas tell you he wrote all night?
- No, I thought he's been blocked.

11:18.077 --> 11:21.171
- Guess he got inspired.
- Oh, well, that's good.

11:21.647 --> 11:22.909
Isn't it?

11:24.283 --> 11:28.014
Yeah. Yeah, as his editor,
I'm thrilled, obviously,

11:28.854 --> 11:32.620
but as his girlfriend,
I can't help but notice the timing.

11:32.858 --> 11:34.951
Are you talking about Peyton
coming back?

11:35.795 --> 11:37.524
I sound like a jealous girlfriend.

11:37.596 --> 11:40.087
No. No, you don't.

11:40.166 --> 11:41.258
Thank you.

11:42.001 --> 11:44.128
Look, I know Lucas
better than anyone does,

11:44.203 --> 11:46.763
and I'm telling you,
he's very much in love with you.

11:49.141 --> 11:50.665
Thanks, Haley.

11:51.210 --> 11:52.541
You got it.

11:53.679 --> 11:58.844
Okay, now I need you to tell me that I'm
not totally insane for hiring a hot nanny.

12:00.786 --> 12:05.223
Wow. I'm pretty sure you have more toys
than any other kid on the planet.

12:05.825 --> 12:09.158
- You can play with them. I don't mind.
- Thanks.

12:14.567 --> 12:17.092
Daddy doesn't like it
when I play basketball.

12:17.169 --> 12:19.637
- Why not?
- Can you keep a secret?

12:20.639 --> 12:22.971
I'm the best at keeping secrets.

12:25.878 --> 12:28.904
- Okay, but no telling.
- Okay.

12:56.909 --> 12:59.571
Hey, hey, hey, yeah.

13:00.045 --> 13:02.605
It's good to see everybody working
on their dunks,

13:02.681 --> 13:05.081
considering most of you can't
even make a free throw.

13:05.151 --> 13:09.281
You guys lost eight games last year
by three points or less. Eight.

13:09.655 --> 13:13.421
Now, does anyone know how many games
you won by three points or less?

13:14.560 --> 13:15.822
- I do.
- Hmm.

13:15.895 --> 13:18.125
- Zero.
- That's right. None.

13:19.565 --> 13:22.193
Now, maybe if you guys
could've hit a few free throws,

13:22.268 --> 13:24.930
maybe you could've made the play-offs.

13:25.404 --> 13:28.703
So this is how we're gonna start.
Fundamentals.

13:30.910 --> 13:32.434
See this spot?

13:33.345 --> 13:36.974
We gonna start practice
every day from this line right here,

13:37.049 --> 13:39.711
and any player who can't step up
and knock down three straight free throws

13:39.785 --> 13:43.551
in a row is gonna run all day.

13:47.259 --> 13:49.591
So who wants to prove me wrong?

13:51.664 --> 13:53.029
Yeah, yeah.

13:58.571 --> 14:00.562
Go ahead and start running, superstar.

14:00.673 --> 14:01.697
Ouch.

14:01.774 --> 14:04.106
Hey, and don't be high-fiving
nobody, either.

14:04.176 --> 14:05.541
Who's next?

14:09.882 --> 14:11.372
You're late.

14:11.884 --> 14:13.249
It's 1:00.

14:13.552 --> 14:18.114
No, it was 1:00 thirty seconds ago,
which makes you late.

14:18.190 --> 14:19.179
Another strike.

14:21.227 --> 14:23.354
Why do you hate me so much?

14:25.397 --> 14:26.455
Why?

14:27.399 --> 14:30.459
You know, we gave you
a fantastic opportunity here,

14:30.536 --> 14:34.768
but it is so obvious to me that
you think you are above the work.

14:35.941 --> 14:38.842
You don't wanna pay your dues,
you come in late,

14:38.911 --> 14:43.177
you pass around
your worthless audition demo,

14:43.249 --> 14:47.982
and somehow I'm a bitch because I've
decided that you haven't earned it yet.

14:50.189 --> 14:54.387
You know what? Why don't you
just face the reality of the situation?

14:55.594 --> 15:00.861
You're wasting your time here.
You are irrelevant, you are annoying...

15:11.443 --> 15:13.877
And now, you're fired.

15:24.924 --> 15:26.892
I know it wasn't easy for you,
coming here.

15:26.959 --> 15:30.087
- It means a lot to me.
- I didn't come here for you.

15:31.664 --> 15:34.497
You know, as long as I can remember,
you taught me that basketball

15:34.566 --> 15:37.034
was the most important thing
in the world.

15:37.102 --> 15:39.798
So when I lost it,
I thought my life was over.

15:39.872 --> 15:42.067
Only trying to give you the tools
you need to succeed.

15:42.141 --> 15:45.975
Yeah, and those tools ended up
preventing me from succeeding.

15:46.345 --> 15:47.710
"Don't ever back down.

15:47.780 --> 15:50.044
"Second place is the first loser."
Do you remember that?

15:50.115 --> 15:53.573
Don't expect me to apologize for teaching
you to play a game that you love,

15:53.652 --> 15:57.247
- that you chose.
- A game that nearly destroyed my family.

15:58.624 --> 16:01.787
It's not worth it
and my family's all I have now.

16:02.161 --> 16:04.789
That's why I'll never let my son play.

16:04.930 --> 16:06.989
Basketball's taken enough.

16:08.701 --> 16:10.896
You're not on those crutches
'cause I handed you a basketball

16:10.970 --> 16:12.767
when you were three.

16:14.506 --> 16:18.670
And trust me, you not letting your son
play is just as bad as you making him play.

16:18.744 --> 16:21.679
That's why you came here,
to blame me for what happened to you.

16:21.747 --> 16:25.148
No, I've been sitting at home
for four months blaming you,

16:25.217 --> 16:27.208
and now I'm done.

16:27.286 --> 16:31.882
It's time to move on. I'm letting go
of the anger, and I'm letting go of you.

16:33.392 --> 16:36.884
I just had to look you in the eye
when I told you that.

16:37.296 --> 16:38.888
I won't be back.

16:40.499 --> 16:42.399
Don't you see, Nathan?

16:43.068 --> 16:46.367
The strength you need to let go of it,
to leave your old man behind,

16:46.438 --> 16:49.601
- that's what I taught you.
- Well, lesson learned.

16:52.811 --> 16:54.608
<i>(ALL WE</i> AREPLAYING)

16:58.884 --> 17:00.511

17:05.824 --> 17:11.694
Wow, this is officially
the coolest office I've ever been in.

17:11.763 --> 17:14.255
Yeah. Now I just need
to sign a couple bands

17:14.333 --> 17:16.824
and prove to myself
it wasn't all a big mistake.

17:16.902 --> 17:21.202
From what I've heard about you,
I don't think that's gonna be a problem.

17:21.272 --> 17:23.002
I hope you're right.

17:23.442 --> 17:26.605
This is for you.
It's supposed to bring good luck.

17:26.678 --> 17:27.702
Oh.

17:29.114 --> 17:32.049
It's a lucky bamboo.
They don't need much sunlight.

17:32.117 --> 17:34.779
Just make sure you water it every day.

17:35.320 --> 17:37.015
I will. Thank you.

17:38.290 --> 17:40.554
Well, I hope it all works out.

17:41.093 --> 17:45.029
I know we just met, but I just wanted
you to know that I'm here.

17:46.932 --> 17:48.399
Good to know.

17:50.269 --> 17:51.668
Bye, Peyton.

18:03.115 --> 18:06.744
Are you telling me not one of them
made their free throws?

18:06.885 --> 18:11.083
Let's just put it this way. We could've
built the new gym with all them bricks.

18:12.958 --> 18:15.449
You know they're counting on us
to turn this thing around, right?

18:15.527 --> 18:16.960
This season.

18:17.963 --> 18:19.396
They'll get better.

18:19.465 --> 18:23.799
Yeah? Well, if they don't,
maybe we could start a track team.

18:25.504 --> 18:28.735
Come on, keep going.
Run, run, run. Pick it up.

18:38.217 --> 18:40.447
Hey, how'd you get home?

18:41.620 --> 18:44.919
- Took a cab.
- You took an hour-long cab ride?

18:44.990 --> 18:48.323
Must've cost a fortune.
I would've picked you up.

18:48.393 --> 18:51.829
No, don't worry about it.
I get the handicap discount.

18:52.030 --> 18:55.659
You'd think in this town they'd have
a state championship discount.

18:55.734 --> 18:56.826
I went to Pontiac.

18:56.902 --> 19:00.463
You beat us in the championship game.
I cried for a week.

19:00.806 --> 19:02.034
Sorry.

19:02.407 --> 19:05.501
So how does it feel
to be a hometown hero?

19:05.677 --> 19:09.738
I'm not that guy anymore. All right?
Trust me, I'm nobody's hero.

19:10.315 --> 19:12.078
You sure about that?

19:17.923 --> 19:21.188

19:21.994 --> 19:26.192

20:05.537 --> 20:09.530
I promised my mom I'd send her a photo
once you got finished destroying her café.

20:09.608 --> 20:12.372
Okay, that's not fair. I hated doing it.

20:12.811 --> 20:14.608
But I kept the sign.

20:15.480 --> 20:16.504
Oh.

20:17.916 --> 20:20.384
Well, I'll make sure
I mention it in my e-mail.

20:22.020 --> 20:25.046
So what makes you
wanna open up shop here in Tree Hill?

20:25.123 --> 20:30.026
Same reason you're coaching the Ravens.
It's home, and it's good to be home.

20:32.164 --> 20:34.291
- What do you think?
- I gotta be honest.

20:34.366 --> 20:38.200
I think it's the perfect way to continue
the legacy of Karen's Café.

20:39.805 --> 20:41.796
I'm just amazed at how quickly
you got this place together.

20:41.873 --> 20:46.207
- You're very impressive, Brooke Davis.
- Yeah, that's what they tell me.

20:47.045 --> 20:48.979
- So is it everything you imagined?
- Hmm?

20:49.982 --> 20:52.177
Having your own fashion line?

20:53.585 --> 20:56.952
Today it is. Ask me again tomorrow.

21:02.694 --> 21:05.254
Hey, so this is it, huh? You're doing it.

21:05.330 --> 21:08.322
Yeah, well, hopefully
it's just the beginning.

21:08.600 --> 21:10.431
Wow, I can say I was here
when it all started.

21:10.502 --> 21:13.369
Maybe I should steal something
to commemorate the occasion.

21:13.438 --> 21:16.168
Well, if there's no stopping you.

21:17.009 --> 21:18.033
Ooh.

21:18.110 --> 21:22.240
- Bamboo.
- Lucky bamboo. It was from Lindsey.

21:22.881 --> 21:26.282
- Lucas' Lindsey?
- Is that, like, her nickname or something?

21:26.351 --> 21:28.842
This is actually really nice of her.

21:28.920 --> 21:31.821
- Suspiciously nice.
- Oh, stop it. Keep this.

21:31.890 --> 21:35.189
It really did just feel like she was coming
over here to mark her territory,

21:35.260 --> 21:39.993
you know, and then she said,
"I just wanted you to know I'm here."

21:40.165 --> 21:44.602
So she was letting you know that
if you need anything, she's here to help.

21:45.170 --> 21:47.730
She was letting me know
she's not going anywhere.

21:47.806 --> 21:49.865
<i>JASON: Test, test. All right, let's do this.</i>

21:50.142 --> 21:54.806
I gotta be honest with you. That just
really doesn't sound like her, but...

21:54.880 --> 21:57.940
You know, I mean even if she is
doing that and marking her territory,

21:58.016 --> 22:02.146
what difference does it make? It's not like
you came back to town for Lucas, right?

22:03.455 --> 22:07.414
No. I did not come back here for Lucas.
I came back here for me.

22:07.693 --> 22:09.820
Good, that's what I thought.

22:13.298 --> 22:15.061
So who's this band?

22:17.102 --> 22:19.195
Great sound check.

22:19.271 --> 22:21.136
Yeah, really great.

22:21.473 --> 22:24.909
They're local, and they're unsigned.

22:26.178 --> 22:27.702
You can tell that just by looking at them?

22:27.779 --> 22:30.839
Well, four years in LA
at least gave me that.

23:17.996 --> 23:20.863
We found that in Greece
two summers ago.

23:21.666 --> 23:23.429

23:23.535 --> 23:26.265
You want the coffee table?

23:26.671 --> 23:28.366

The house, the furniture,
and if you can be gone in an hour,

23:31.510 --> 23:33.740
I'll throw in an extra 30,000.

23:52.397 --> 23:55.264
No. You can keep Beasley.

24:28.033 --> 24:32.436

- Isn't anything left,

Quentin. I mean, you...

24:35.974 --> 24:37.703
You gotta graduate.

24:39.110 --> 24:41.101
What's it matter to you?

24:42.447 --> 24:45.848
Listen to me. Half the kids
that drop out of high school have no job,

24:45.917 --> 24:48.545
and the ones that do have a job
earn 25% less than the kids

24:48.620 --> 24:52.317
that stayed in school and 63% less
than the ones that graduated college,

24:52.390 --> 24:58.818
so for me it doesn't matter,
but for you, Quentin, it matters a lot.

24:59.397 --> 25:00.989
I'm not kidding.

25:04.369 --> 25:07.463
Maybe you're just hot for me,

Oh, no, no, no. I'm sorry, please, sit down.

25:45.243 --> 25:47.404
Why should we sign with you?

25:47.979 --> 25:52.541
Well, I was in LA for the last four years,
working on a major label,

25:52.617 --> 25:55.950
but I decided to leave because I thought
I could do better on my own.

25:56.021 --> 25:59.218
And when I hear bands like yours,
I know I can.

25:59.758 --> 26:02.124
The majors are a mess right now,

26:02.193 --> 26:05.856

I'm gonna do everything I can

where you wanna be.

26:08.700 --> 26:11.100

As of right now? I mean, there's...
There's nobody yet.

I wanted you guys to be my first.

Why did you bring me that lucky bamboo?

26:58.083 --> 27:00.381
- Well, I just wanted...
- No, I'll tell you why.

27:00.452 --> 27:03.353
You were marking your territory,

I'm not after Lucas, okay?

27:07.892 --> 27:10.224

- Well, then, what do you want?

Peyton, my whole life
I wanted to be an editor,

27:17.669 --> 27:22.106
so when I made it, a friend of mine
gave me a lucky bamboo for my office.

27:22.540 --> 27:24.906
Now, I'm not naive enough
to think that I found my way

27:24.976 --> 27:27.001
because of some plant on my desk,

27:27.078 --> 27:30.536
but that plant was a symbol
that I had finally made it.

27:31.149 --> 27:33.413
That's all I was trying to give you.

you started living your dream.

Does Haley know you went to see him?

No, she doesn't,
and I'd like to keep it that way.

29:31.770 --> 29:34.568
you might wanna try investing in a razor.

29:58.096 --> 30:01.293
And the other thing that I have
that none of the other labels have

30:01.366 --> 30:03.300
is an interest in you guys.

30:03.368 --> 30:06.303
Now, I can have you
in a recording studio tomorrow,

30:06.371 --> 30:10.808
so if it is really about the music,
you might wanna reconsider.

30:11.910 --> 30:13.571
Have a good show.

30:17.816 --> 30:21.946
<i>The wolves all howl and the birds all sing it</i>

30:22.020 --> 30:24.181
<i>'He backed down '</i>

30:25.056 --> 30:29.254
<i>The wolves all howl and the birds all sing it</i>

30:29.694 --> 30:31.389
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

30:33.965 --> 30:35.762
Before I go, I need to say something.

30:35.834 --> 30:39.600
Of course you do.
Like a bug that can't be squashed.

30:41.105 --> 30:43.198
You never gave me a chance.

30:43.808 --> 30:47.005
You hated me from the start
because of how I look.

30:47.078 --> 30:49.546
It's always about how people look.

30:50.682 --> 30:53.549
I mean, take you. You dress all uptight,

30:53.618 --> 30:56.416
hiding your hot body
behind your cold personality,

30:56.487 --> 30:59.047
but at the end of the day
you know you got it.

30:59.123 --> 31:01.751
You know, go hire your hot anchor
and hang out with your hot friends

31:01.826 --> 31:03.817
and be hot, but you'll never know
what you're missing.

31:03.895 --> 31:07.626
'Cause I'm good at what I do
and I'm gonna prove you wrong.

31:16.541 --> 31:17.633
Hey.

31:28.486 --> 31:30.545
- That was kind of hot.
- Yeah.

32:01.853 --> 32:03.115
- Hi.
- Hey.

32:03.187 --> 32:04.552
Tough day?

32:04.622 --> 32:07.750
Yeah, I can't remember
the last one that wasn't.

32:09.560 --> 32:12.859
Oh, I just think I'm realizing
that I can't help everybody,

32:12.931 --> 32:15.900
and I still somehow feel responsible,
and I don't...

32:15.967 --> 32:18.265
I don't know why I keep trying.

32:18.970 --> 32:22.804
Maybe I'm avoiding this,
you know, coming home.

32:22.874 --> 32:26.173
It's such a terrible thing to say, I know.
I just...

32:26.878 --> 32:28.971
Hasn't been easy, you know?

32:29.847 --> 32:33.078
Well, you should go inside.
There's someone waiting to see you.

32:33.751 --> 32:36.743
Jamie. He's such a good boy, isn't he?

32:36.821 --> 32:39.119
- Bye.
- Bye. Thank you.

32:45.096 --> 32:46.290
Jamie?

32:48.733 --> 32:50.724
Where'd you go, Jim Jam?

33:04.182 --> 33:05.672
What is this?

33:07.018 --> 33:09.816
- It's the beginning.
- Of what?

33:10.989 --> 33:13.583
Of the way it's gonna be from now on.

33:16.227 --> 33:20.095
I know that it's gonna take
a lot more than dinner,

33:23.568 --> 33:25.763
but I figure it's a start, right?

33:34.712 --> 33:36.179
I missed you.

33:44.822 --> 33:45.914
Mmm.

33:49.627 --> 33:51.561
So how was your day?

33:51.629 --> 33:54.257
Oh, enough about me. How was your day?

33:56.134 --> 33:58.364
Yeah, how was your day, Mama?

34:00.571 --> 34:03.563
Oh, my day just got a lot better.

34:11.049 --> 34:14.507
- I'm starving. Let's eat.
- Let's eat. Pass me that plate.

34:14.585 --> 34:16.280
Oh, look at this.

34:17.655 --> 34:21.181
I can't vouch for any of this
because Jamie made it all.

34:21.292 --> 34:22.520
(LAUGHING)

34:22.592 --> 34:24.925
- Oh, no.
- I just watched, pretty much.

34:24.996 --> 34:25.985
Okay, well...

34:31.668 --> 34:34.297
Brooke, this place looks great.

34:35.039 --> 34:38.338
Think if I can't sign any bands soon,
maybe I can get a job here?

34:38.409 --> 34:41.810
I'm sorry, darling, you're not nearly bitchy
enough to work in one of my stores.

34:42.380 --> 34:46.315
I don't know about that.
I have references. Just ask Lindsey.

34:46.384 --> 34:49.148
- Lucas' Lindsey?
- Does everyone call her that?

34:49.219 --> 34:50.744
Were you mean to her?

34:50.822 --> 34:54.781
No! She was marking her territory,
and I just called her on it.

34:56.427 --> 34:58.895
- She thinks I'm after Lucas.
- She said that?

34:58.963 --> 35:02.558
She didn't have to. It was obvious.
She showed up with this, like,

35:02.633 --> 35:06.125
bad luck bamboo thing
and a story about how it was, like,

35:06.204 --> 35:10.106
a symbol of my dream, but I'm pretty sure
it was just to guilt trip me.

35:10.174 --> 35:12.142
- Peyton...
- And then, get this,

35:12.210 --> 35:16.704
she says to me,
"I just want you to know, I'm here."

35:17.782 --> 35:18.874
What is that?

35:18.950 --> 35:22.044
I mean, you're opening up
your own store and does she bring you

35:22.120 --> 35:23.678
a lucky bamboo?

35:27.859 --> 35:29.793
- I'm such a bitch.
- Mmm.

35:30.528 --> 35:33.622
Look on the bright side. Now I'd hire you
to work in one of my stores in a second.

35:33.698 --> 35:36.826
- No, really, I suck.
- Yeah, you do.

35:37.635 --> 35:40.661
Matter of fact, it's a wonder
that you have any friends at all.

35:40.738 --> 35:42.729
But you do. Come with me.

35:44.642 --> 35:46.507
So the entire class stands up, and I said,

35:46.577 --> 35:49.478
"Any student that walks out that door
fails this quarter."

35:49.547 --> 35:51.981
- You didn't say that.
- I totally did.

35:53.251 --> 35:56.084
You're like... You're like the mean teacher.

35:56.254 --> 35:57.778
It's kind of hot.

35:59.690 --> 36:02.716
Well, well, don't you think it's a little
past your bedtime, mister?

36:02.793 --> 36:04.158
I think so.

36:04.829 --> 36:07.297
Hey, I'll tell you what,
since it's a special occasion,

36:07.365 --> 36:10.391
I think we should stay up a little
later tonight. Unless you're too tired.

36:10.468 --> 36:11.492
No, I'm not tired.

36:11.569 --> 36:13.560
- No?
- Okay, come here.

36:13.871 --> 36:17.170
I was thinking, maybe we could go outside

36:17.508 --> 36:19.703
and shoot around with this thing.

36:20.478 --> 36:22.469
Is that something
you'd like to do with me?

36:22.547 --> 36:24.276
I don't know.

36:24.815 --> 36:26.578
Yeah, I don't really know either.

36:26.651 --> 36:28.744
- Maybe it's not...
- No, Dad.

36:30.288 --> 36:34.452
All right, well, let's see if you're ready.
Show me your jump shot.

36:34.525 --> 36:36.322
<i>(BLOOD</i> YNOSEPLAYING)

36:36.561 --> 36:40.691
Nice! Nice arc. Hold that follow-through.
There you go.

36:43.935 --> 36:45.334
Surprise.

36:45.770 --> 36:50.173
- You rented a house?
- Well, not exactly.

36:50.708 --> 36:53.871
Brooke, you did not just buy this house?

36:55.012 --> 36:57.640
- What are you thinking?
- What? You don't like it?

36:57.715 --> 36:59.546
No, it's incredible.

37:00.151 --> 37:02.517
Good, 'cause that's your room.

37:04.755 --> 37:08.350
<i>Tell me about the booze and the Bowery</i>

37:11.829 --> 37:14.320
Your son left this for you earlier.

37:16.734 --> 37:19.430
<i>I've seen your face before</i>

37:20.071 --> 37:22.471
<i>Though I didn't recognize</i>

37:22.607 --> 37:25.303
<i>'Til you walked out the door</i>

37:28.946 --> 37:30.641
Try one more time.

37:33.384 --> 37:35.045
Beautiful, that was awesome.

37:35.119 --> 37:36.381
Nice form.

37:36.454 --> 37:38.786
You'll be doing that
on 10-foot baskets some day.

37:47.198 --> 37:49.462
All right, let's see one more.

37:49.800 --> 37:51.028
Nice!

37:51.469 --> 37:54.905
<i>We'll take the car down the highways</i>

37:57.308 --> 38:00.766
<i>We won't get fooled by the bad days</i>

38:00.845 --> 38:04.178
So we're gonna give you a chance.
Don't let us down.

38:05.583 --> 38:06.982
I won't.

38:08.786 --> 38:12.153
<i>Clean your bloody nose in the bathroom</i>

38:14.592 --> 38:17.117
<i>I've seen your face before</i>

38:17.928 --> 38:20.488
<i>Though I didn't recognize</i>

38:20.564 --> 38:22.964
<i>'Til you walked out the door</i>

38:26.170 --> 38:28.161
<i>And I've seen that face before</i>

38:28.239 --> 38:29.729
Thank you.

38:29.807 --> 38:31.934
<i>Now I'll always wonder why</i>

38:32.009 --> 38:34.876
<i>Don't know me anymore</i>

38:39.583 --> 38:40.709
Uh...

38:41.085 --> 38:45.715
I've been putting on a brave face
for a few weeks now.

38:45.790 --> 38:48.953
You have these two gorgeous
ex-girlfriends back in town,

38:49.026 --> 38:51.961
and I am trying so hard to be okay with it,

38:52.463 --> 38:56.092
but I have to ask you a question,
and I promise I'll never ask it again.

38:59.437 --> 39:01.632
Should I be worried about us?

39:06.977 --> 39:10.845
Lindsey, I love you.

39:12.483 --> 39:14.610
That is never gonna change.

39:17.388 --> 39:19.322
Nothing to worry about.

39:33.671 --> 39:37.664
Hey, you know what?
I just thought of something.

39:37.808 --> 39:41.403
What if Lucas' Lindsey
gave you a lucky bamboo

39:41.479 --> 39:44.778
because she was marking her territory
with you, too?

39:45.916 --> 39:47.247
Let it go.

39:47.985 --> 39:50.249
- I'm calling her Lucas' Lindsey now.
- Yeah.

39:50.321 --> 39:54.690
God. Look at the view.

39:56.761 --> 39:59.321
Look, this place is beautiful, but...

40:00.664 --> 40:01.722
But?

40:03.300 --> 40:07.964
I just worry I'm keeping you from your life.
I know you came down here for me.

40:08.038 --> 40:11.007
You know, in New York I had everything
I thought I wanted.

40:11.075 --> 40:13.134
Money, celebrity, success.

40:14.812 --> 40:17.178
But you know what I didn't have?

40:19.016 --> 40:21.177
Sunrise with my best friend.

40:25.022 --> 40:26.956
Well, isn't that sweet.

40:29.193 --> 40:30.319
What are you doing here?

40:30.394 --> 40:33.227
Well, when you stupidly charge a house
to the company

40:33.297 --> 40:35.629
we have to confirm the address.

40:37.535 --> 40:40.595
Vacation's over.
It's time to get back to work.

40:41.338 --> 40:43.465
Forget it, I'm staying here.

40:43.941 --> 40:45.568
Stop being a spoiled brat.

40:45.643 --> 40:47.474
There's a flight in a few hours.
I will be on it,

40:47.545 --> 40:50.673
- and you'll be sitting next to me.
- No, I'm not going back.

40:50.748 --> 40:52.409
- Brooke.
- Mother.

41:03.093 --> 41:06.153
I'll see you on the plane,
my dutiful daughter.

41:06.864 --> 41:08.491
Goodbye, Peyton.

41:10.768 --> 41:12.531
Goodbye, Mrs. Davis.

41:18.008 --> 41:20.533
Well, your mom's still a bitch.

41:22.980 --> 41:24.811
What're you gonna do?
