10:43.143 --> 10:45.475
NOT ANYMORE.
NOW HE WORKS FOR ME.

10:45.475 --> 10:47.187
SAYS THE HYDRA AGENT.

10:47.187 --> 10:48.859
MY DAYS WITH HYDRA
ARE OVER.

10:48.859 --> 10:52.322
JUST AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR
TRYING TO MAKE AMENDS.

10:52.322 --> 10:54.114
WE REMAIN SKEPTICAL.

10:54.114 --> 10:56.737
WITH GOOD CAUSE,
BUT I BELIEVE USING BAKSHI

10:56.737 --> 10:59.659
IS THE ONLY WAY FOR
US TO SUCCESSFULLY
INFILTRATE THIS BASE.

10:59.659 --> 11:01.371
THE BASE
IS IN THE ARCTIC CIRCLE

11:01.371 --> 11:03.123
WITH NOTHING AROUND
FOR MILES.

11:03.123 --> 11:04.374
HYDRA
WILL SEE US COMING.

11:04.374 --> 11:06.626
WHICH IS WHY IT'S CRITICAL
I TAKE IN A SMALL TEAM.

11:06.626 --> 11:09.089
WEAVER: And just to be clear,
Agent Coulson,

11:09.089 --> 11:11.051
what is
your objective here?

11:11.051 --> 11:12.382
WE RESCUE
THE ENHANCED PRISONERS,

11:12.382 --> 11:14.004
THEN DISABLE
THE MISSILE-DEFENSE SYSTEM

11:14.004 --> 11:16.256
SO THAT S.H.I.E.L.D. JETS
CAN FLY IN SAFELY

11:16.256 --> 11:17.597
TO BOMB
THE FACILITY.

11:17.597 --> 11:20.060
YOU REALLY BELIEVE
A SMALL TEAM CAN DO THIS?

11:20.060 --> 11:22.182
MY TEAM CAN.

11:22.182 --> 11:24.354
THEN I SUPPOSE WE SHOULD
PUT THIS MATTER TO A VOTE.

11:24.354 --> 11:26.146
AGENT MORSE.

11:26.146 --> 11:27.728
I'M IN.

11:29.019 --> 11:30.520
AGENTS WEAVER
AND OLIVER.

11:30.520 --> 11:32.522
No.
Too risky.

11:32.522 --> 11:33.814
I agree.

11:33.814 --> 11:35.315
Gonzales: UNDERSTOOD.

11:35.315 --> 11:37.157
BUT I'M VOTING
TO GO AHEAD WITH THIS.

11:37.157 --> 11:40.530
THAT LEAVES YOU WITH
THE DECIDING VOTE, AGENT MAY.

11:42.162 --> 11:46.827
I'D LIKE A WORD IN PRIVATE
WITH AGENT COULSON FIRST.

11:52.252 --> 11:53.713
YOU LOOK UPSET.

11:53.713 --> 11:55.255
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

11:55.255 --> 11:57.337
I FEEL SORRY
FOR HER.

11:57.337 --> 12:02.012
YEAH, WELL, SHOULD'VE SEEN HER
BACK ON THE PLANE WITH WARD.

12:02.012 --> 12:05.185
SEEMS THE TWO OF THEM
ARE IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER.

12:05.185 --> 12:07.437
WHATEVER THAT IS,
IT'S NOT LOVE.

12:07.437 --> 12:08.979
[ SCOFFS ] NO.

12:08.979 --> 12:10.230
OF COURSE NOT.

12:11.611 --> 12:13.984
HEY, THANK YOU FOR PACKING
THE SANDWICH BEFORE I LEFT.

12:13.984 --> 12:15.405
IT WAS
REALLY DELICIOUS.

12:15.405 --> 12:16.526
OH.

12:16.526 --> 12:18.158
YOU'RE QUITE WELCOME.

12:18.158 --> 12:20.200
BUT I JUST
DON'T UNDERSTAND

12:20.200 --> 12:23.033
WHY COULSON WOULD TAKE WARD
ON A MISSION.

12:23.033 --> 12:25.035
IT'S SIMPLY
TOO DANGEROUS.

12:25.035 --> 12:27.037
YEAH.
FOR WARD, MAYBE.

12:28.328 --> 12:30.580
I ATTACKED HIM
BACK ON THE QUINJET.

12:30.580 --> 12:32.873
HUNTER HAD TO PULL ME
OFF HIM, SO...

12:32.873 --> 12:34.754
REALLY?
YEAH, YEAH.

12:34.754 --> 12:36.636
LUCKY FOR HIM.

12:36.636 --> 12:39.840
YOU KNOW, WHAT I SHOULD'VE DONE
IS TOSSED HIM FROM THE PLANE.

12:39.840 --> 12:42.052
YEAH,
THAT WOULD'VE BEEN FITTING,

12:42.052 --> 12:44.434
BUT PERHAPS
THERE'S A BETTER WAY STILL.

12:48.348 --> 12:49.479
SPLINTER BOMBS.

12:49.479 --> 12:52.562
SIMPLY FIND WARD ALONE,
STICK ONE OF THESE ON,

12:52.562 --> 12:54.394
AND POOF --
NO MORE WARD.

12:54.394 --> 12:57.067
YEAH, THAT PROBABLY WOULD BE
QUITE A FITTING WAY FOR, UM...

12:57.067 --> 12:58.989
WAIT.

13:00.490 --> 13:01.902
YOU'RE SERIOUS.

13:01.902 --> 13:04.955
WARD IS A THREAT TO EVERY AGENT
WORKING IN S.H.I.E.L.D.

13:04.955 --> 13:06.536
ISN'T IT
OUR RESPONSIBILITY

13:06.536 --> 13:08.829
TO AT LEAST
ARM OURSELVES AGAINST HIM?

13:11.211 --> 13:13.213
May: WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU THINKING?

13:13.213 --> 13:15.125
I COULD ASK YOU
THE SAME THING.

13:15.125 --> 13:16.506
SINCE WHEN
DID YOU BECOME

13:16.506 --> 13:18.588
A HIGH-RANKING MEMBER
OF TEAM GONZALES?

13:18.588 --> 13:21.221
SOMEONE HAD TO RUN THE BASE
WHILE YOU WERE GONE.

13:21.221 --> 13:23.723
HAVING A SEAT
ALLOWED ME TO KEEP YOU SAFE.

13:23.723 --> 13:25.225
I WAS FINE
ON MY OWN.

13:25.225 --> 13:27.057
SEEMS THAT'S
HOW YOU OPERATE BEST.

13:27.057 --> 13:28.348
WHAT THE HELL
IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

13:28.348 --> 13:31.061
THAT YOU'VE BEEN LYING TO ME
EVER SINCE S.H.I.E.L.D. FELL.

13:31.061 --> 13:33.193
ALL THOSE OVERSEAS TRIPS
YOU WERE TAKING,

13:33.193 --> 13:36.897
THEY WERE NEVER ABOUT RECRUITING
NEW AGENTS, WERE THEY?

13:36.897 --> 13:39.149
YOU WANT TO TELL ME
WHAT THETA PROTOCOL IS?

13:39.149 --> 13:40.240
NO.
BECAUSE YOU
DON'T TRUST ME.

13:40.240 --> 13:42.032
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT
THE DIRECTOR OF S.H.I.E.L.D.

13:42.032 --> 13:43.153
NEITHER ARE YOU.

13:44.324 --> 13:46.656
NOT ANYMORE.

13:47.747 --> 13:50.370
WE'VE ALWAYS
HAD OUR SECRETS, MAY.

13:50.370 --> 13:53.833
YOU HAD A SECRET LINE TO FURY
BEHIND MY BACK.

13:53.833 --> 13:54.955
THIS...

13:54.955 --> 13:57.417
IS PERSONAL.

14:00.220 --> 14:01.882
THIS IS
ABOUT ANDREW.

14:01.882 --> 14:03.673
HE'S MY EX-HUSBAND.

14:03.673 --> 14:08.178
AND YOU WERE WORKING WITH HIM --
BEHIND MY BACK.

14:09.229 --> 14:11.391
I WENT TO HIM
FOR COUNSELING.

14:11.391 --> 14:14.274
HE WAS THE ONLY THERAPIST
I COULD TALK TO

14:14.274 --> 14:17.067
ABOUT MY
ALIEN-WRITING IMPULSES.

14:18.478 --> 14:21.861
YOU SHOULD'VE TOLD ME.

14:21.861 --> 14:23.073
YOU'RE RIGHT.

14:23.073 --> 14:24.154
I SHOULD HAVE,

14:24.154 --> 14:27.827
AND I WILL APOLOGIZE
TO YOU LATER, AT LENGTH.

14:27.827 --> 14:30.700
BUT RIGHT NOW,
LIST HAS MIKE PETERSON

14:30.700 --> 14:34.204
AND WHO KNOWS HOW MANY
OTHER ENHANCED PRISONERS.

14:34.204 --> 14:38.048
NOW CAN WE PUT THIS BEHIND US
AND GO RESCUE THEM?

14:38.048 --> 14:38.999
PLEASE?

14:40.710 --> 14:42.882
WHAT PART OF "NO"
DIDN'T YOU UNDERSTAND?

14:42.882 --> 14:45.055
THE PART WHERE
YOU WON'T TAKE ME TO LINCOLN.

14:45.055 --> 14:46.636
I TOLD YOU,
NO ONE ENTERS

14:46.636 --> 14:49.059
OR LEAVES AFTERLIFE
UNTIL WE KNOW IT'S SAFE.

14:49.059 --> 14:50.350
IT'LL BE TOO LATE
BY THEN.

14:50.350 --> 14:52.812
S.H.I.E.L.D. MAY BE WRONG
ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS,

14:52.812 --> 14:54.514
BUT THEY NEVER
LEAVE A MAN BEHIND.

14:54.514 --> 14:55.645
I'M SORRY --

14:55.645 --> 14:57.817
Raina: DON'T GIVE UP HOPE
JUST YET.

14:57.817 --> 14:59.689
SKYE CAN SAVE LINCOLN.

14:59.689 --> 15:01.151
I SAW HER DO IT.

15:01.151 --> 15:03.233
WH-- YOU'VE SEEN IT?

15:03.233 --> 15:05.825
WE THINK RAINA'S GIFT
MAY ALLOW HER

15:05.825 --> 15:07.988
TO SEE THINGS
BEFORE THEY HAPPEN.

15:07.988 --> 15:10.030
I THOUGHT HER GIFT
WAS SPINNING REALLY FAST

15:10.030 --> 15:11.291
TO COLLECT
GOLD RINGS.

15:11.291 --> 15:13.033
TELL ME
WHAT YOU SAW.

15:13.033 --> 15:14.494
Raina:
MAYBE SHE'S RIGHT.

15:14.494 --> 15:16.586
WHAT I SAW
DOESN'T MAKE MUCH SENSE.

15:16.586 --> 15:18.878
WHY WOULD COULSON
BE WORKING WITH WARD?

15:20.340 --> 15:23.093
C-COULSON AND WARD WERE TOGETHER
BACK AT CAL'S OFFICE,

15:23.093 --> 15:24.884
BUT I DIDN'T...
TELL ANYONE.

15:24.884 --> 15:27.847
YOU HAVE TO GO.

15:27.847 --> 15:30.100
YOU DO GO.

15:30.100 --> 15:31.221
GO WHERE?

15:31.221 --> 15:32.472
LINCOLN'S IN A DARK ROOM
WITH TWO DOCTORS.

15:32.472 --> 15:34.314
THEY'RE CUTTING
INTO HIM.

15:34.314 --> 15:35.435
YOU FIND HIM.

15:35.435 --> 15:37.897
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO CAN SAVE HIM.

15:37.897 --> 15:40.110
YOU HAVE TO TAKE ME.

15:40.110 --> 15:43.113
I PROMISED JIAYING
I WOULDN'T USE MY GIFT.

15:43.113 --> 15:45.195
YOU NEED PERMISSION
TO SAVE A FRIEND?

15:45.195 --> 15:47.907
LAST TIME I WENT BACK
FOR LINCOLN, HYDRA
ALMOST CAPTURED ME.

15:47.907 --> 15:49.329
HOW WILL THIS
BE ANY DIFFERENT?

15:49.329 --> 15:55.035
BECAUSE WHERE YOU TAKE SKYE
IS A LONG WAY FROM HYDRA.

15:57.537 --> 16:00.000
YOU'RE TAKING THIS
TOO FAR.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.132
IT'S THE ONLY WAY
WE CAN MOVE FORWARD.

16:04.004 --> 16:07.847
I'LL GO HELP MY TEAM
WHILE YOU STAY HERE AND
RECONNECT WITH YOUR PAST.

16:07.847 --> 16:09.929
THAT MADE SENSE
WHEN IT WAS JUST CALLING MY MOM.

16:09.929 --> 16:11.261
THIS IS
SOMETHING ELSE ENTIRELY.

16:11.261 --> 16:14.644
LISTEN, YOU'RE
A S.H.I.E.L.D. AGENT, KARA.

16:14.644 --> 16:18.518
I WAS A S.H.I.E.L.D. AGENT...
A LONG TIME AGO...

16:18.518 --> 16:20.440
BEFORE HYDRA TOOK ME...

16:20.440 --> 16:22.362
BEFORE I MET YOU.

16:22.362 --> 16:27.197
BEING A S.H.I.E.L.D. AGENT
WAS TAKEN FROM YOU.

16:27.197 --> 16:31.371
THIS IS YOUR CHANCE TO GET
THAT PART OF YOURSELF BACK.

16:32.452 --> 16:35.665
AND I'LL KEEP SAYING IT
UNTIL YOU BELIEVE ME.

16:35.665 --> 16:38.078
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS STAY STRONG.

16:38.078 --> 16:40.830
Morse: IF YOU DIDN'T
WANT ME TO GO,

16:40.830 --> 16:43.543
THEN WHY DID YOU VOTE
TO ALLOW IT?

16:43.543 --> 16:47.047
BECAUSE COULSON'S ONLY USING
HIS OWN PEOPLE.

16:47.047 --> 16:49.429
FIGURED IT WAS WORTH
THE RISK.

16:49.429 --> 16:52.011
THOSE ARE S.H.I.E.L.D. AGENTS
GOING ON THAT MISSION, ROBERT.

16:52.011 --> 16:54.224
I'M AWARE OF THAT,
AGENT MORSE.

16:54.224 --> 16:59.059
WE'RE FIGHTING A WAR WITH
AN ENEMY THAT IS WITHOUT HONOR.

16:59.059 --> 17:04.022
SOMETIMES, WE MAKE SACRIFICES
FOR THE GREATER GOOD.

17:20.160 --> 17:22.212
EXCUSE ME, SIR, BUT I'D LIKE
TO JOIN THE MISSION.

17:22.212 --> 17:24.584
I APPRECIATE THE OFFER,
AGENT SIMMONS,

17:24.584 --> 17:26.546
BUT THIS
IS A SPECIALIZED TEAM.

17:26.546 --> 17:29.048
AGENT MAY IS THERE
FOR TACTICAL SUPPORT,

17:29.048 --> 17:31.091
FITZ TO DISABLE
THE DEFENSE SYSTEMS...

17:31.091 --> 17:33.093
AND WHO'S THERE
TO LOOK AFTER MIKE'S INJURIES?

17:33.093 --> 17:34.554
WARD?

17:34.554 --> 17:35.935
HYDRA'S ALREADY
REMOVED MIKE'S EYE.

17:35.935 --> 17:37.227
GOD KNOWS WHAT ELSE
THEY'VE DONE TO HIM.

17:37.227 --> 17:39.229
HE'LL NEED A DOCTOR,
AND PREFERABLY ONE

17:39.229 --> 17:42.142
ALREADY FAMILIAR WITH DEATHLOK'S
ANATOMICAL STRUCTURE.

17:42.142 --> 17:44.063
YOU SURE
ABOUT THIS?

17:44.063 --> 17:45.105
ABSOLUTELY.

17:45.105 --> 17:47.857
THIS IS SOMETHING
I HAVE TO DO.

17:47.857 --> 17:49.529
SUIT UP.

17:59.038 --> 18:00.330
[ MOTOR WHIRRING ]

18:07.297 --> 18:08.418
[ ELECTRICITY CRACKLES ]

18:08.418 --> 18:10.550
ON YOUR KNEES,
NOW.

18:10.550 --> 18:12.712
MAY,
THIS ISN'T ME.

18:16.636 --> 18:17.767
SKYE.

18:17.767 --> 18:19.058
HEY, GUYS.

18:20.600 --> 18:21.721
THIS IS GREAT.

18:21.721 --> 18:24.184
WE FINALLY GOT THE TEAM
BACK TOGETHER.

18:30.190 --> 18:31.821
HOW ARE THEY ALL?
ARE YOU MAKING FRIENDS?

18:31.821 --> 18:33.193
HOW DID YOU GET THE INTEL
ABOUT THE BASE?

18:33.193 --> 18:34.614
CAN YOU CONTROL
YOUR POWERS, OR...?

18:34.614 --> 18:35.825
YES.

18:35.825 --> 18:37.997
YES, I-I PROMISE I WILL
TELL YOU GUYS EVERYTHING.

18:37.997 --> 18:39.159
IT'S A LOT.

18:39.159 --> 18:40.950
YOU MIGHT NOT BELIEVE ME,
BUT JUST NOT NOW.

18:40.950 --> 18:42.792
WELL, WE'RE JUST
HAPPY TO SEE YOU,

18:42.792 --> 18:44.414
AND YOU'RE BEING
SO SECRETIVE.

18:44.414 --> 18:46.546
NO, I'M HAPPY
TO SEE YOU, TOO, BUT --

18:46.546 --> 18:48.047
YEAH, WE'VE GOT A MISSION TO DO,
NOT MUCH TIME,

18:48.047 --> 18:49.379
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH,
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

18:49.379 --> 18:50.460
NO,
WARD IS HERE.

18:50.460 --> 18:52.212
I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT ANYTHING PERSONAL

18:52.212 --> 18:53.213
IN CASE
HE'S JUST --

18:53.213 --> 18:54.214
DID I HEAR
MY NAME?

18:54.214 --> 18:56.216
HE'S LIKE CANDYMAN.

18:56.216 --> 18:58.468
WE SHOULD REVIEW
THE OP.

18:59.929 --> 19:02.642
WARD --
CAN'T BELIEVE I'M SAYING THIS...

19:04.023 --> 19:05.815
...BRING US UP TO SPEED
ON BAKSHI'S INTEL.

19:05.815 --> 19:08.228
Ward:
ALL RIGHT.

19:08.228 --> 19:10.570
BAKSHI'S USING
OLD HYDRA TEXT CHANNELS

19:10.570 --> 19:13.193
TO PROVIDE US WITH INTEL,
ALTHOUGH M--

19:15.405 --> 19:16.986
MUCH OF IT IS,
UH...

19:18.698 --> 19:20.039
MUCH...

19:20.039 --> 19:22.081
ALL RIGHT.

19:22.081 --> 19:25.124
CAN WE JUST ADDRESS
THE ELEPHANT ON THE PLANE?

19:25.124 --> 19:28.047
I KNOW.
THIS IS WEIRD.

19:28.047 --> 19:30.590
MISTAKES WERE MADE.

19:30.590 --> 19:31.921
BY YOU.

19:31.921 --> 19:34.214
AND PEOPLE GOT HURT.
BY YOU.

19:34.214 --> 19:39.849
AND I COULD STAND HERE
AND EXPLAIN AGAIN HOW MY PARENTS

19:39.849 --> 19:42.061
AND BROTHER
LEFT ME VULNERABLE --

19:42.061 --> 19:44.013
WE ALL
HAD OUR TRAUMAS, WARD.

19:44.013 --> 19:46.396
DIDN'T TURN ANY OF US
INTO PSYCHOPATHS.

19:46.396 --> 19:49.188
WELL, WE ALL HAVE OUR OWN WAYS
OF COPING, DON'T WE?

19:49.188 --> 19:50.900
FOR EXAMPLE,
I WAS YOURS.

19:50.900 --> 19:52.862
WATCH IT,
WARD.

19:52.862 --> 19:56.115
LOOK, I'M JUST SAYING
WE ALL MADE MISTAKES.

19:56.115 --> 19:59.869
COULSON HANDED ME OVER
TO MY ABUSER -- THANK YOU.

19:59.869 --> 20:02.081
SKYE SHOT ME --
AFTER YOU KILLED
HOW MANY PEOPLE?

20:02.081 --> 20:05.585
YEAH, AND WE WERE A TEAM AND
A FAMILY, AND YOU BETRAYED US.

20:05.585 --> 20:06.826
I KNOW.

20:06.826 --> 20:08.628
IT'S WHAT I REGRET
THE MOST.

20:08.628 --> 20:12.832
NOT THE LYING, THE S.H.I.E.L.D.
AGENTS I HAD TO PUT DOWN,

20:12.832 --> 20:16.506
AND -- I'M SORRY -- NOT EVEN
DROPPING YOU TWO IN THE OCEAN.

20:17.717 --> 20:19.679
IT'S THIS.

20:19.679 --> 20:24.223
MY ACTIONS
DESTROYED THIS.

20:26.646 --> 20:28.608
I'LL REGRET THAT
FOREVER.

20:28.608 --> 20:32.231
'CAUSE THERE WERE
