00:00.001 --> 00:03.402
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Glad you're back. Here we go.</i>

00:03.404 --> 00:05.270
<i>As you know, jane was</i>
<i>accidentally inseminated</i>

00:05.272 --> 00:06.705
<i>With rafael's sperm.</i>

00:06.707 --> 00:09.308
I accidentally inseminated you
two weeks ago.

00:09.310 --> 00:12.011
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Oh, and the doctor?</i>
<i>She was rafael's sister.</i>

00:12.013 --> 00:14.613
<i>And rafael underwrote her</i>
<i>medical malpractice insurance.</i>

00:14.615 --> 00:16.482
No one would insure luisa
with her history of addiction.

00:16.484 --> 00:17.716
<i>But jane didn't know that,</i>

00:17.718 --> 00:19.485
<i>And rafael wasn't</i>
<i>about to tell her.</i>

00:19.487 --> 00:21.587
<i>And from there,</i>
<i>things got complicated.</i>

00:21.589 --> 00:24.423
<i>See, jane was with michael,</i>
<i>but now she's not.</i>

00:24.425 --> 00:26.759
<i>And rafael was with petra.</i>
<i>We're done, petra.</i>

00:26.761 --> 00:29.028
<i>And despite</i>
<i>jane's reservations...</i>

00:29.030 --> 00:31.430
What's better for a baby than
its parents actually together?

00:31.432 --> 00:33.599
...Jane and rafael were falling
<i>for each other.</i>

00:33.601 --> 00:36.435
<i>Unfortunately, jane's mother,</i>
<i>xo, did not approve.</i>

00:36.437 --> 00:39.605
Rafael is already a bad
influence on you.
He's a good guy.

00:39.607 --> 00:43.175
<i>For the record, xiomara's love</i>
<i>life was complicated as well.</i>

00:43.177 --> 00:45.210
<i>See, she was falling</i>
<i>for jane's father,</i>

00:45.212 --> 00:47.312
<i>Telenovela star</i>
<i>rogelio de la vega.</i>

00:47.314 --> 00:48.747
<i>But she broke it off.</i>

00:48.749 --> 00:50.749
You have to focus on your
relationship with jane,

00:50.751 --> 00:52.551
And I'll only get
in the way.

00:52.553 --> 00:54.486
<i>And she was currently</i>
<i>distracting herself</i>

00:54.488 --> 00:56.388
<i>With a new man.</i>
<i>Good to see you.</i>

00:56.390 --> 00:58.090
<i>And speaking of complicated,</i>

00:58.092 --> 00:59.691
<i>Dr. Luisa had been hooking up</i>

00:59.693 --> 01:01.593
<i>With her stepmother, rose.</i>

01:01.595 --> 01:04.229
<i>That is, until she fell</i>
<i>off the wagon and disappeared.</i>

01:04.231 --> 01:05.798
I don't know where you are.

01:05.800 --> 01:08.534
<i>Oh, and michael</i>
<i>was currently on the hunt</i>

01:08.536 --> 01:11.070
<i>For the notorious drug dealer</i>
<i>known as sin rostro.</i>

01:11.072 --> 01:12.304
<i>And honestly, there are</i>

01:12.306 --> 01:13.705
<i>A gazillion other things</i>
<i>going on.</i>

01:13.707 --> 01:15.774
But we should just get started,
<i>right?</i>

01:17.077 --> 01:18.777
<i>As a young girl,</i>

01:18.779 --> 01:22.147
<i>Jane gloriana villanueva</i>
<i>loved to hear stories.</i>

01:22.149 --> 01:23.782
Okay, so tell me what happened.

01:23.784 --> 01:24.850
From the very beginning.

01:24.852 --> 01:27.486
Well, first the producer said

01:27.488 --> 01:28.854
He loved my voice.
Then he said

01:28.856 --> 01:30.622
I had great energy up there.

01:32.459 --> 01:34.093
Xiomara:
Oh, sorry, ma.

01:34.095 --> 01:35.194
I didn't mean to wake you.

01:37.797 --> 01:39.398
Oh, shoot.

01:39.400 --> 01:40.699
I thought I paid this.

01:42.669 --> 01:45.204
Mom, it's a parking ticket.
I'll pay the fine.

01:49.409 --> 01:51.844
So... What <i>is</i> it about?

01:54.848 --> 01:56.248
I like long stories.

02:20.406 --> 02:22.674
So what does that have to do
with mom's parking ticket?

02:28.615 --> 02:30.249
How can I be patient?

02:30.251 --> 02:31.550
I haven't seen you in two weeks.

02:31.552 --> 02:32.885
I know, I know.

02:32.887 --> 02:35.254
I-I miss you, too.
I'm hurrying.

02:35.256 --> 02:36.889
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Do you know what?</i>
<i>I'm gonna stop right here.</i>

02:36.891 --> 02:39.224
<i>I should really set the stage.</i>
<i>Fill in some gaps.</i>

02:39.226 --> 02:42.227
(phone chimes)
<i>ah, yes.</i>

02:42.229 --> 02:45.731
<i>This is where we left off.</i>

02:45.733 --> 02:47.232
<i>Rafael, you'll remember,</i>
<i>was about to meet jane, when...</i>

02:47.234 --> 02:48.534
We've got to talk.

02:48.536 --> 02:49.868
Dad, not
right now.

02:49.870 --> 02:52.204
You're fired.
What?

02:52.206 --> 02:53.639
Why?

02:55.175 --> 02:56.642
Narrator:
And here's what you didn't see.

02:56.644 --> 02:57.943
I'm sorry.

02:57.945 --> 03:00.479
I felt obligated
to tell your father.

03:00.481 --> 03:01.880
You're jeopardizing
the hotel.

03:01.882 --> 03:03.315
What the hell
are you talking about?

03:03.317 --> 03:05.684
The fact that you put up
your shares of the hotel

03:05.686 --> 03:08.453
For luisa's medical malpractice
insurance.

03:08.455 --> 03:09.788
I did that, dad,
but come on.

03:09.790 --> 03:11.223
You're the one
who always says

03:11.225 --> 03:12.291
Family comes
first, right?

03:12.293 --> 03:13.959
The problem is,

03:13.961 --> 03:15.460
Luisa needs to answer
to this lawsuit in two weeks.

03:15.462 --> 03:17.196
If she doesn't, this waitress...

03:17.198 --> 03:17.963
Jane.

03:17.965 --> 03:19.965
Right. Jane.

03:19.967 --> 03:21.833
Jane could get
a default judgment

03:21.835 --> 03:25.904
And then lay claim
to your 20% of the marbella.

03:25.906 --> 03:28.473
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And that led to this.</i>

03:28.475 --> 03:30.275
(phone rings)

03:30.277 --> 03:31.343
Hey. Where are you?

03:31.345 --> 03:33.245
I'm on my way to the airport.

03:33.247 --> 03:34.746
I have to go to mexico city.

03:34.748 --> 03:36.648
What? Why?

03:36.650 --> 03:39.985
It has to do with your lawsuit

03:39.987 --> 03:41.987
And my sister.

03:41.989 --> 03:43.922
But, jane, I don't want
to make you uncomfortable.

03:43.924 --> 03:45.490
Oh. Uh... Church and state,

03:45.492 --> 03:46.992
We separate everything.

03:46.994 --> 03:49.494
Don't tell me why
you're going to mexico city

03:49.496 --> 03:50.862
As someone who's
suing your sister.

03:50.864 --> 03:53.732
Tell me as...

03:53.734 --> 03:55.901
Someone who cares about you

03:55.903 --> 03:58.570
And wants to know why the hell
you're going to mexico city.

03:58.572 --> 04:01.340
If luisa doesn't come back
in two weeks,

04:01.342 --> 04:03.275
Then you get a default judgment
against her.

04:03.277 --> 04:05.010
Latin lover narrator:
<i>I should pause to point out</i>

04:05.012 --> 04:08.347
<i>That jane had no idea that</i>
<i>rafael's hotel was on the line.</i>

04:08.349 --> 04:10.249
<i>And he wasn't</i>
<i>about to tell her.</i>

04:10.251 --> 04:12.017
We have a hacienda
in mexico city.

04:12.019 --> 04:13.986
I've been tracking
her credit cards.

04:13.988 --> 04:16.555
Just to make sure she's alive.

04:18.658 --> 04:20.259
I really hope you find her.

04:20.261 --> 04:22.327
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And that brings us...</i>

04:24.030 --> 04:25.330
I'm sorry you didn't find her.

04:25.332 --> 04:26.765
It was like chasing a ghost.

04:26.767 --> 04:28.267
A drunk ghost.

04:28.269 --> 04:30.002
San miguel,
mexico city, tulum...

04:30.004 --> 04:32.004
Jane:
She probably figures

04:32.006 --> 04:34.039
Her insurance will take care
of my lawsuit.

04:35.008 --> 04:36.808
So how was teaching?

04:36.810 --> 04:38.810
Oh, you know... Uneventful.

04:38.812 --> 04:41.280
A lot of grading papers.

04:41.282 --> 04:43.548
Latin lover narrator:
<i>There was one other thing.</i>

04:43.550 --> 04:45.384
<i>She also spent</i>
<i>a great deal of time</i>

04:45.386 --> 04:47.286
Hugging churchgoers who thought
<i>she could grant miracles</i>

04:47.288 --> 04:48.954
<i>Because she was</i>
<i>a pregnant virgin.</i>

04:48.956 --> 04:50.322
<i>But jane wasn't about</i>
<i>to tell him that.</i>

04:50.324 --> 04:51.657
I just want to see you.

04:51.659 --> 04:52.958
I've really missed you.

04:53.993 --> 04:55.294
I'm here.

05:03.569 --> 05:04.803
Hi.

05:04.805 --> 05:06.371
Hi.

05:10.610 --> 05:11.943
What?

05:14.914 --> 05:16.882
You're showing.
(laughs)

05:16.884 --> 05:18.483
Yeah, I am,
a little, right?

05:18.485 --> 05:19.918
Are you still
feeling good?

05:19.920 --> 05:21.420
Yeah. Yeah.

05:27.327 --> 05:29.561
So...

05:29.563 --> 05:32.364
This is my place.

05:32.366 --> 05:33.832
Yeah, I've been here,
actually.

05:33.834 --> 05:35.834
With petra.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.736
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Ah, yes. Petra.</i>

05:37.738 --> 05:39.404
<i>I'm not gonna lie.</i>

05:39.406 --> 05:41.340
<i>The last two weeks have been</i>
<i>tough for petra.</i>

05:41.342 --> 05:43.575
You can't keep ordering
room service.

05:43.577 --> 05:45.677
When I settle my divorce,
I'm going to have to pay it off.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.579
Oh, petra, stop.

05:47.581 --> 05:50.082
We are cooped up
in this tiny room.

05:50.084 --> 05:51.516
Ivan:
Yeah.

05:51.518 --> 05:52.984
Oh, stop.
You're no better.

05:52.986 --> 05:54.986
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Having a hostage</i>

05:54.988 --> 05:56.822
<i>Was turning into</i>
<i>a major headache.</i>

05:56.824 --> 05:58.590
Who needs lobster every night?

05:58.592 --> 06:02.127
(phone ringing)

06:02.129 --> 06:03.562
Hello?

06:03.564 --> 06:05.831
Rafael's back.
Here we go.

06:05.833 --> 06:07.399
No more leaving,
okay?

06:07.401 --> 06:08.500
Okay.

06:16.676 --> 06:18.844
I missed you
so much, jane.

06:23.416 --> 06:25.417
Should we move
to the bedroom?

06:25.419 --> 06:26.852
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Ah. Now it's time for jane</i>

06:26.854 --> 06:28.487
<i>To tell him she's a virgin.</i>

06:30.790 --> 06:32.424
I should
probably go home.

06:32.426 --> 06:34.059
I have court
tomorrow, so...

06:34.061 --> 06:35.694
Oh. Uh... Okay.

06:35.696 --> 06:37.929
Um... Well, can I
take you to dinner?

06:37.931 --> 06:39.865
To celebrate
your victory?

06:39.867 --> 06:42.401
Winning a default judgment
against your sister?

06:42.403 --> 06:43.168
Church and state.

06:45.438 --> 06:48.073
Maybe afterwards,
you could even...

06:48.075 --> 06:49.908
Sleep over.

06:49.910 --> 06:52.177
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Okay, tell him right now.</i>

06:58.117 --> 07:00.051
<i>And speaking of sleeping over,</i>

07:00.053 --> 07:02.654
<i>Remember marco,</i>
<i>xo's soccer-playing hottie?</i>

07:02.656 --> 07:06.191
<i>The past few weeks had been</i>
<i>pretty good for them.</i>

07:06.193 --> 07:07.526
(crashing)

07:08.861 --> 07:11.463
<i>Less good, however,</i>
<i>for rogelio.</i>

07:11.465 --> 07:14.166
Oh. Rogelio. Again.

07:14.168 --> 07:16.134
Ugh, it's so
annoying.

07:16.136 --> 07:19.204
He's trying to get
close to jane, so...

07:22.575 --> 07:24.176
I should
probably head in.

07:24.178 --> 07:27.179
Oh. But first, eva would
like you to come over

07:27.181 --> 07:28.980
For an official
family dinner.

07:28.982 --> 07:30.982
Like with place mats
and everything.

07:30.984 --> 07:33.151
Sounds good.

07:33.153 --> 07:34.586
(rattling)

07:35.922 --> 07:37.589
Bye.
Bye.

07:37.591 --> 07:40.559
Rogelio:
Oh, hello, xiomara.

07:40.561 --> 07:42.194
Finished with your date so soon?

07:42.196 --> 07:44.830
What are you even
doing here again?

07:44.832 --> 07:46.531
I was actually helping
jane prepare for court.

07:46.533 --> 07:47.933
I have played many lawyers,

07:47.935 --> 07:49.167
So I was giving her
lots of tips.

07:49.169 --> 07:50.836
Ah. Got it.

07:54.540 --> 07:57.242
Avoiding rogelio
and his legal tips?

07:57.244 --> 07:58.877
Yeah, something about...

07:58.879 --> 08:00.912
Putting hand sanitizer
under my eyes,

08:00.914 --> 08:02.214
So that I can cry.

08:02.216 --> 08:04.149
Oh...

08:04.151 --> 08:07.652
So... How was the big
reunion with rafael?

08:10.256 --> 08:12.591
It was good.

08:12.593 --> 08:14.993
Uh-oh.

08:14.995 --> 08:17.229
What happened?
We...

08:17.231 --> 08:20.999
Had a moment in his penthouse

08:21.001 --> 08:22.501
Where I could have told him

08:22.503 --> 08:23.969
That I'm not having sex,
but I didn't.

08:23.971 --> 08:26.171
Makes sense.

08:26.173 --> 08:27.839
I don't know how a guy
like that responds.

08:27.841 --> 08:29.508
Seriously?
What?

08:29.510 --> 08:30.542
"a guy like that"?

08:30.544 --> 08:32.244
I'm sorry.

08:32.246 --> 08:34.279
I-I just don't really
see you two together.

08:34.281 --> 08:35.981
I mean, you're so different.
You just are.

08:35.983 --> 08:37.282
Great. Thanks for the talk.

08:37.284 --> 08:38.717
I feel so much better now.

08:38.719 --> 08:40.585
Jane, I'm just
being honest,

08:40.587 --> 08:41.653
Just like you're
honest with me

08:41.655 --> 08:42.888
When you don't
like someone.

08:42.890 --> 08:44.155
Rafael's not "someone."

08:44.157 --> 08:45.590
I'm having his baby.

08:45.592 --> 08:47.659
You're right.

08:49.695 --> 08:52.564
Petra:
I heard you were back.

08:53.799 --> 08:55.867
I live here.

08:55.869 --> 08:58.703
The question is, why
are you still here?

08:58.705 --> 09:01.006
Well, I don't really
have any money, do I?

09:01.008 --> 09:02.707
Till we settle our
divorce, anyway.

09:02.709 --> 09:05.977
Of course, for the right price,

09:05.979 --> 09:08.280
I would move on now.

09:08.282 --> 09:10.215
Were you always a monster?

09:11.617 --> 09:13.985
Or did you become one
along the way?

09:13.987 --> 09:17.055
Should we...
Review our courtship?

09:18.824 --> 09:20.258
I was engaged
to a man I loved.

09:20.260 --> 09:21.793
Who loved me.

09:23.930 --> 09:26.064
<i>You were passed over</i>
<i>for a promotion</i>

09:26.066 --> 09:28.633
And so, to get back at lachlan,

09:28.635 --> 09:30.135
<i>You set your sights on me.</i>

09:30.137 --> 09:31.836
So tell me, rafael,

09:31.838 --> 09:33.238
Who's the monster?

09:33.240 --> 09:35.073
But you see,

09:35.075 --> 09:36.608
I had the advantage,

09:36.610 --> 09:38.243
Because I always knew
you were an entitled playboy

09:38.245 --> 09:40.812
With a tendency
to self-sabotage.

09:40.814 --> 09:42.180
And jane will find out
soon enough.

09:42.182 --> 09:43.982
Don't you dare
mention jane.

09:43.984 --> 09:46.051
How chivalrous.

09:47.086 --> 09:48.820
Let's be real.

09:48.822 --> 09:50.322
You two won't last.

09:50.324 --> 09:52.591
She's a good girl.

09:52.593 --> 09:55.627
And... Well...

09:55.629 --> 09:58.597
We've already established
what you are.

10:08.641 --> 10:09.874
Mom, hurry up!

10:09.876 --> 10:11.142
We can't be
late to court!

10:11.144 --> 10:12.744
Are you not coming, abuela?

10:15.014 --> 10:16.948
Okay, okay, I'm ready.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.383
One more
button, ma.

10:18.385 --> 10:19.651
Got it.

10:19.653 --> 10:21.686
Okay, so, what's
the procedure?

10:21.688 --> 10:22.954
The lawyer said
it should be easy.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.189
Since luisa's not here,

10:24.191 --> 10:25.657
We'll request
a default judgment.

10:25.659 --> 10:27.659
A default judgment is
ridiculous, your honor.

10:27.661 --> 10:29.327
With all due
respect,

10:29.329 --> 10:30.929
A week is all we're asking.

10:33.299 --> 10:34.332
Another week?

10:34.334 --> 10:36.668
Your honor, no.

10:39.205 --> 10:42.140
That's another week into
my client's unwanted pregnancy.

10:42.142 --> 10:43.675
This event has derailed

10:43.677 --> 10:45.410
Her life.

10:45.412 --> 10:47.979
And dr. Alver is exhibiting
that same recklessness now

10:47.981 --> 10:49.147
By not answering this claim.

10:49.149 --> 10:50.815
Luisa:
Actually, no, I'm here.

10:50.817 --> 10:51.816
Hi!

10:53.252 --> 10:55.420
I am so sorry that I'm late.

10:55.422 --> 10:56.388
Judge:
Dr. Alver,

10:56.390 --> 10:57.889
I presume?

10:57.891 --> 10:59.658
(chuckles)

11:03.896 --> 11:05.430
Latin lover narrator:
<i>You're probably wondering</i>
<i>where luisa has been.</i>

11:05.432 --> 11:07.866
<i>Until a week ago, luisa was</i>

11:07.868 --> 11:09.200
<i>Drinking tequila,</i>

11:09.202 --> 11:10.368
<i>Kissing strange women,</i>

11:10.370 --> 11:13.905
<i>And dancing naked.</i>

11:13.907 --> 11:15.273
I was lost,

11:15.275 --> 11:16.975
But, your honor,

11:16.977 --> 11:18.743
I stand before you here today,

11:18.745 --> 11:22.347
Ready to accept any punishment
that you deem necessary.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.416
Judge:
This isn't a sentencing.

11:24.418 --> 11:26.051
You just have to answer
the petition.

11:26.053 --> 11:27.185
Oh.

11:27.187 --> 11:28.386
Well, then I answer it.

11:28.388 --> 11:30.288
I'm here.

11:30.290 --> 11:33.091
I do need to consult
with my client.

11:33.093 --> 11:35.226
Absolutely not.
This is ridiculous.

11:35.228 --> 11:37.295
(gavel bangs)
she's here to answer
the petition.

11:37.297 --> 11:38.963
There's no default judgment.

11:39.965 --> 11:41.099
Dr. Alver,

11:41.101 --> 11:42.734
This is your last chance.

11:42.736 --> 11:44.135
Don't worry, your honor.

11:44.137 --> 11:45.370
I'm back.

11:45.372 --> 11:47.338
Rafael:
<i>Where the hell were you?</i>

11:47.340 --> 11:48.973
I chased you all over mexico.

11:48.975 --> 11:50.341
Yes, I know.

11:50.343 --> 11:52.077
I was in peru

11:52.079 --> 11:53.845
On an ayahuasca retreat.

11:53.847 --> 11:56.081
What the hell is ayahuasca?

11:59.351 --> 12:02.253
Is that the psychedelic drink
that makes you constantly vomit?

12:02.255 --> 12:03.888
Exactly, but...

12:03.890 --> 12:06.224
But it's like you're
vomiting out everything

12:06.226 --> 12:08.026
That's wrong with your life.

12:08.028 --> 12:09.761
It's, it's really
difficult to describe,

12:09.763 --> 12:12.097
But I had a shaman, and I was
guided through this journey,

12:12.099 --> 12:13.164
And in my journey,

12:13.166 --> 12:16.401
I saw everything so clearly.

12:16.403 --> 12:18.002
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Full disclosure, I tried it.</i>

12:18.004 --> 12:19.070
<i>Did nothing for me.</i>

12:19.072 --> 12:20.238
What's clear

12:20.240 --> 12:21.406
Is that you are an addict.

12:21.408 --> 12:23.041
Yes.

12:23.043 --> 12:24.409
Exactly.

12:24.411 --> 12:26.010
But why? Why?

12:26.012 --> 12:27.412
What was I trying to escape?

12:27.414 --> 12:29.314
And then it dawned on me.

12:29.316 --> 12:32.383
Money is the root
of all my problems.

12:32.385 --> 12:34.753
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Well, money and the fact that</i>

12:34.755 --> 12:37.255
She inseminated the wrong woman
<i>with rafael's sperm.</i>

12:37.257 --> 12:39.057
We're gonna talk
about this later.

12:39.059 --> 12:41.092
I'm glad you're home.

12:41.094 --> 12:42.761
Thanks, daddy.

12:44.096 --> 12:45.463
We should talk.

12:46.398 --> 12:48.366
I would really like that.

12:50.770 --> 12:52.937
Latin lover narrator:
<i>I should stop here,</i>

12:52.939 --> 12:55.373
<i>Catch you up on jane</i>
<i>and michael.</i>

12:55.375 --> 12:58.977
<i>Yep, it's been that awkward.</i>

12:58.979 --> 13:01.246
You okay?
Don't even have time
to think about her.

13:01.248 --> 13:03.882
We're hours away from the
biggest moment of our career.

13:03.884 --> 13:06.151
You sure the shipment's
coming in today?

13:06.153 --> 13:08.019
You confident in your contact
at the coast guard?

13:08.021 --> 13:10.121
Yeah.

13:10.123 --> 13:11.523
Michael, I...

13:11.525 --> 13:13.958
I get that seeing jane around
every day is hard.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.426
Nadine, stop.

13:15.428 --> 13:18.196
We agreed we're just
having fun, right?

13:18.198 --> 13:20.064
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And by fun, he means this.</i>

13:22.301 --> 13:23.334
Let's just hope

13:23.336 --> 13:25.170
The drugs come in and lead us

13:25.172 --> 13:26.371
To sin rostro.

13:28.073 --> 13:30.041
Rogelio:
Lemonade?

13:31.210 --> 13:32.811
In high school,
you only drank lemonade

13:32.813 --> 13:34.445
When you were feeling sad.

13:36.015 --> 13:38.416
Well, things aren't going
very well at the moment.

13:38.418 --> 13:40.418
Latin lover narrator:
<i>With marco, please say</i>
<i>with marco.</i>

13:40.420 --> 13:42.086
I came by here to see
if they needed me

13:42.088 --> 13:43.354
To fill any spots
in the lounge,

13:43.356 --> 13:44.989
But they said
they were all full.

13:44.991 --> 13:46.324
(sighs)

13:46.326 --> 13:48.426
Once again,
I'm back to square one.

13:48.428 --> 13:49.360
Don't worry.

13:49.362 --> 13:51.329
I believe in you almost as much

13:51.331 --> 13:52.964
As I believe in myself.

13:54.433 --> 13:55.400
Thanks, rogelio.

13:55.402 --> 13:57.402
(zaps)
ow!
Ow!

13:58.437 --> 13:59.470
Must be my shoes.

13:59.472 --> 14:01.072
Finest italian leather.

14:01.074 --> 14:02.841
(chuckles)

14:02.843 --> 14:03.942
I'm worried.
Dad,

14:03.944 --> 14:06.477
Luisa actually
doesn't seem crazy.

14:06.479 --> 14:08.079
A psychedelic drink,

14:08.081 --> 14:10.114
And she has a
spiritual awakening?

14:10.116 --> 14:11.449
Idiotic, yes,

14:11.451 --> 14:12.951
But not clinically crazy.

14:12.953 --> 14:15.153
I agree with rafael.

14:15.155 --> 14:16.354
For what it's worth.

14:16.356 --> 14:18.556
In any case, she's back.

14:19.992 --> 14:22.327
So I would really like
my job back as well.

14:22.329 --> 14:24.195
I'll toe the line.

14:24.964 --> 14:26.965
Fine.

14:26.967 --> 14:29.267
But you'll answer
to lachlan.

14:30.436 --> 14:31.436
Okay, got it.

14:31.438 --> 14:34.439
Hey, lachlan.

14:34.441 --> 14:37.442
So, I just got an interesting
call from your father.

14:37.444 --> 14:38.443
Yeah.

14:38.445 --> 14:40.211
I answer to you now.

14:40.213 --> 14:42.280
Petra:
Well, to me,

14:42.282 --> 14:43.414
Actually.
What the hell

14:43.416 --> 14:44.515
Are you doing here?

14:44.517 --> 14:45.650
Petra has
some connections

14:45.652 --> 14:46.951
In miami society.

14:46.953 --> 14:48.353
She agreed to help us

14:48.355 --> 14:51.489
Bounce back
from your mishaps.

14:51.491 --> 14:53.157
I'm not working for petra.

14:53.159 --> 14:54.459
Oh.

14:54.461 --> 14:56.227
Hmm.

14:56.229 --> 14:58.529
I thought your father was
pretty clear about it.

14:58.531 --> 15:00.665
You answer to me, and...

15:00.667 --> 15:02.667
Well... This is

15:02.669 --> 15:05.303
What I want.

15:06.272 --> 15:07.472
Screw you both.

15:13.545 --> 15:16.314
Okay, but why would lachlan
want to hire petra?

15:16.316 --> 15:18.583
'cause he wants to
get under my skin.

15:18.585 --> 15:21.552
Why?
He was actually engaged to petra
at one point.

15:21.554 --> 15:23.421
What?

15:23.423 --> 15:25.423
I kind of...

15:25.425 --> 15:27.625
Stole her from him.

15:28.594 --> 15:30.161
Oh.

15:30.163 --> 15:32.063
Look, I was
a different guy back then.

15:32.065 --> 15:33.564
I'm reacting.

15:33.566 --> 15:35.533
At least let me react.

15:35.535 --> 15:36.567
Your scotch.

15:36.569 --> 15:38.569
Thank you.
And some chips

15:38.571 --> 15:40.605
And our spinach-artichoke dip.

15:40.607 --> 15:41.973
Oh, we didn't
actually order anything.

15:41.975 --> 15:43.608
They're from that couple
over there.

15:43.610 --> 15:46.144
They said it was
for jane the virgin.

15:46.146 --> 15:47.345
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

15:47.347 --> 15:48.646
I'm s... Uh, j...

15:48.648 --> 15:50.281
Jane the virgin?

15:50.283 --> 15:52.417
Thank you.

15:52.419 --> 15:53.651
Jane the virgin?
What does that mean?

15:53.653 --> 15:55.486
Well...

15:55.488 --> 15:58.323
It's, um...

15:58.325 --> 15:59.991
It's a web site.

15:59.993 --> 16:02.160
Do you remember
rogelio's stepdaughters?

16:02.162 --> 16:03.394
Yeah.

16:03.396 --> 16:06.164
They started it
to be making fun of me.

16:06.732 --> 16:08.032
<i>Just say it.</i>

16:08.034 --> 16:09.534
And the fact that I'm a virgin.

16:10.669 --> 16:12.236
Which I am.

16:12.238 --> 16:13.738
(chuckles):
And now a pregnant virgin.

16:13.740 --> 16:16.741
Huh.
So, the web site--
it went viral, and...

16:16.743 --> 16:19.544
Now, you know,
some people believe,

16:19.546 --> 16:22.480
Because I'm a pregnant virgin,
that I can grant miracles.

16:22.482 --> 16:24.182
Wait, what?

16:24.184 --> 16:27.986
I can't, just to be clear.

16:29.722 --> 16:31.556
Uh, wow.

16:31.558 --> 16:33.624
A virgin?
Yeah.

16:33.626 --> 16:34.659
Wait, so you and michael
never...

16:34.661 --> 16:36.394
No.
Not even after you got engaged?

16:36.396 --> 16:37.762
No. (chuckles)

16:37.764 --> 16:39.097
Really?

16:39.099 --> 16:39.497
No!

16:39.499 --> 16:41.366
(chuckles)

16:41.368 --> 16:42.767
Not even...

16:42.769 --> 16:43.768
Rafael?

16:46.038 --> 16:48.573
I made a promise to my grandma
when I was young

16:48.575 --> 16:50.541
That I would wait till marriage.

16:50.543 --> 16:53.611
That's what I've done.

16:53.613 --> 16:56.147
And that's still your plan?

16:56.149 --> 16:58.249
Yes.

16:58.251 --> 17:00.184
Definitely.

17:01.153 --> 17:03.321
That's... That's...

17:03.323 --> 17:05.690
That's great.

17:05.692 --> 17:07.558
(exhales):
Oh, yeah.

17:07.560 --> 17:08.559
Excuse me.

17:08.561 --> 17:10.495
You need another drink?

17:10.497 --> 17:12.397
I'm reacting.
I can react, right?

17:12.399 --> 17:13.765
Yeah, you're allowed to react.

17:13.767 --> 17:15.700
Waitress:
Another scotch?
Uh, yes, please.

17:15.702 --> 17:18.503
It should be noted that michael
<i>did not react like this</i>

17:18.505 --> 17:20.638
<i>When she told</i> him
<i>she was a virgin.</i>

17:20.640 --> 17:23.541
<i>But that's</i>
<i>neither here nor there.</i>

17:24.643 --> 17:25.543
Check that number.

17:25.545 --> 17:28.179
Nadine:
8-3-2.

17:28.181 --> 17:29.647
Yeah, that's it.

17:29.649 --> 17:32.683
You realize this could be
huge for us, right?

17:32.685 --> 17:35.720
We follow this shipment,
learn where sin rostro
has been hiding.

17:35.722 --> 17:38.089
Okay, we got to
stay focused.

17:38.091 --> 17:39.524
We got to stay focused.
Yeah.

17:39.526 --> 17:41.559
Yeah, you're right.
Michael:
Here we go.

17:41.561 --> 17:43.194
Look, I'm sorry
I freaked out, okay?

17:43.196 --> 17:44.729
I'm over it.
It's fine.

17:44.731 --> 17:46.097
Fine?

17:46.099 --> 17:47.832
Uh, you just
surprised me,
that's all.

17:47.834 --> 17:49.567
Yeah, I definitely
got that.

17:49.569 --> 17:52.403
It's just, it's not something
that you normally hear.

17:52.405 --> 17:54.539
Not... No, not that
you're not normal.

17:54.541 --> 17:56.607
It's fine. I get it.

17:56.609 --> 17:58.176
Fine?

17:58.178 --> 17:59.644
Yeah, fine.

18:01.346 --> 18:03.181
Look, it's been a long day--
I just think

18:03.183 --> 18:04.582
We should call it a night.
Jane...

18:04.584 --> 18:06.150
Rafael, I'm tired.

18:07.453 --> 18:08.853
Fine.

18:11.757 --> 18:13.825
(sighs)

18:17.763 --> 18:18.763
(loud banging)
what?

18:18.765 --> 18:20.498
(banging)

18:22.401 --> 18:23.835
Oh!

18:23.837 --> 18:25.103
Get down, get down.

18:26.305 --> 18:28.306
Nadine:
Is that sin rostro?

18:28.308 --> 18:30.842
Michael:
No way.

18:30.844 --> 18:33.578
Sin rostro's already
in miami, and we've got
intel to back that up.

18:33.580 --> 18:36.214
Okay, so maybe
it's his new contact,

18:36.216 --> 18:39.450
Whoever's taking over
for roman zazo.

18:39.452 --> 18:40.818
We got to go.

18:45.290 --> 18:48.192
Hi, babe.
Hey.

18:48.194 --> 18:50.661
You'll never guess
who called here tonight.

18:50.663 --> 18:52.463
Elliot lantana.

18:52.465 --> 18:54.232
He's an actual legitimate
record producer.

18:54.234 --> 18:55.867
He heard me sing at the club,

18:55.869 --> 18:58.369
And he wants to record
a demo with me!

18:58.371 --> 19:00.471
That's amazing, ma.
I know, right?

19:00.473 --> 19:02.874
Watch out,
paulina rubio!

19:02.876 --> 19:04.709
Hon?
Hmm?

19:04.711 --> 19:06.277
How'd it go with rafael?

19:06.279 --> 19:07.645
Did you tell him you're waiting?

19:09.248 --> 19:10.448
Come on.

19:10.450 --> 19:11.849
I got your message
loud and clear.

19:11.851 --> 19:14.418
I'm on board.
Did you tell him?

19:14.420 --> 19:16.454
How did he take it?
Well. He took it well.

19:16.456 --> 19:17.555
Good.

19:17.557 --> 19:19.457
Mm-hmm.

19:20.425 --> 19:23.294
I was just
so worried.

19:23.296 --> 19:24.595
About you.

19:24.597 --> 19:26.797
I know. I'm sorry.

19:26.799 --> 19:30.501
(sighs) but how
I felt about you--

19:30.503 --> 19:32.470
That's part of what
I was running from.

19:32.472 --> 19:34.472
No, I get that.

19:34.474 --> 19:36.474
Look, here's the thing.

19:36.476 --> 19:39.277
When I was in the sweat lodge,

19:39.279 --> 19:41.345
Drinking my tea,

19:41.347 --> 19:44.348
Throwing up,
being guided by my shaman,

19:44.350 --> 19:47.652
I kept... Seeing your face.

19:49.421 --> 19:51.622
It was a little distorted,

19:51.624 --> 19:54.559
But... It was you.

19:54.561 --> 19:56.260
Luisa.

19:56.262 --> 20:00.498
I came here to be
truthful and honest.

20:00.500 --> 20:03.768
And if I'm being
truthful and honest...

20:03.770 --> 20:06.270
I still want to be with you.

20:06.272 --> 20:08.739
I want us to tell

20:08.741 --> 20:10.975
Everyone what happened
and just...

20:10.977 --> 20:12.843
Run away together.

20:14.213 --> 20:16.414
We can't do that.

20:18.517 --> 20:20.985
It's over.

20:20.987 --> 20:22.920
For real, this time.

20:22.922 --> 20:25.823
(long sigh)

20:25.825 --> 20:27.491
Ah...

20:27.493 --> 20:30.494
I had a feeling
you might say that.

20:31.697 --> 20:33.698
Regardless,

20:33.700 --> 20:36.667
We still have to tell my father
what happened between us.

20:36.669 --> 20:38.836
What?
My shaman thinks
it's really important

20:38.838 --> 20:41.672
For me to just come clean
about all my lies.

20:41.674 --> 20:44.475
Your shaman doesn't understand
the situation.

20:44.477 --> 20:46.978
No, he really does.
Luisa,

20:46.980 --> 20:49.580
It will destroy my marriage.

20:49.582 --> 20:51.549
Or make it stronger.

20:51.551 --> 20:54.452
(quietly):
What are you talking about?
Rose...

20:54.454 --> 20:57.622
I know this is
gonna be hard,

20:57.624 --> 20:59.557
But trust me, once you do it,

20:59.559 --> 21:01.692
You're gonna feel
so much better.

21:01.694 --> 21:03.894
Healthier.

21:03.896 --> 21:05.529
Don't worry.

21:05.531 --> 21:07.298
I'll give you time to...

21:07.300 --> 21:09.267
To figure out how
to break it to him.

21:09.269 --> 21:10.801
Tell my father.

21:10.803 --> 21:12.937
Or I will.

21:26.351 --> 21:28.419
Woman:
<i>Long day?</i>

21:32.357 --> 21:35.359
Oh, yeah.

21:35.361 --> 21:36.627
Me, too.

21:36.629 --> 21:37.828
(chuckles)

21:37.830 --> 21:39.063
The longest.

21:42.668 --> 21:44.802
Oh, here, have mine.

21:44.804 --> 21:46.637
I haven't touched
it, I swear.

21:46.639 --> 21:47.972
No, that's...
It's fine, thank you.

21:47.974 --> 21:51.008
Come on, I paid 17 bucks
for this thing.

21:51.010 --> 21:53.077
I swear, this place is
such a rip-off.

22:00.018 --> 22:02.753
Thank you.

22:02.755 --> 22:03.754
Cheers.

22:03.756 --> 22:04.822
(chuckles)

22:11.830 --> 22:13.531
Oh.

22:13.533 --> 22:15.066
(both chuckle)

22:17.769 --> 22:19.570
What's he doing?

22:19.572 --> 22:22.073
Well, considering he's at
the front desk getting a key...

22:23.675 --> 22:25.843
...I'm gonna go with
checking in.
Thanks, wiseass.

22:25.845 --> 22:28.012
Makes sense
that he's here;

22:28.014 --> 22:30.014
This is the hub of the
sin rostro operation.

22:30.016 --> 22:31.115
Did you get
the picture?

22:31.117 --> 22:33.617
Yep.
Great.

22:33.619 --> 22:36.654
I'll get it to my friend at
the fbi to run face recognition.

22:36.656 --> 22:39.023
You trust
this friend?
Yeah, absolutely.

22:48.100 --> 22:50.368
(xiomara singing in spanish)

22:57.609 --> 23:01.412
â™ª this is my life
and this is my turn â™ª

23:01.414 --> 23:05.683
â™ª chasing the dreams
that I long for â™ª

23:05.685 --> 23:07.618
â™ª I know that love,
it will conquer... â™ª

23:07.620 --> 23:08.619
Man:
Stop, stop, stop.

23:08.621 --> 23:09.887
Stop, stop.

23:18.663 --> 23:20.598
Here is the problem.

23:20.600 --> 23:23.134
While you were singing,
I kept wishing <i>I</i> was singing.

23:23.136 --> 23:25.736
So I need you to get me
out of my head.

23:25.738 --> 23:27.738
How do I do that?

23:27.740 --> 23:29.807
Dig deeper, xiomara.

23:29.809 --> 23:31.742
Dig deeper.

23:31.744 --> 23:34.745
Oh, just one second,
one second.

23:34.747 --> 23:38.048
â™ª dig deeper,
deeper, deeper. â™ª

23:38.050 --> 23:39.683
Sorry, song idea.

23:39.685 --> 23:40.885
Get me out of my head.

23:40.887 --> 23:42.686
Understand?

23:42.688 --> 23:44.889
Okay, let's go
from the top again.

23:44.891 --> 23:48.025
Jane, can you take some mimosas
up to room 467?

23:48.027 --> 23:49.627
I don't do room service.

23:49.629 --> 23:51.862
Well, you served one
of our vip guests the other day,

23:51.864 --> 23:54.165
And apparently
he's taken a liking to you.

23:54.167 --> 23:56.100
To be clear,
that's creepy,

23:56.102 --> 23:57.768
Uh, and I'm not
going into the room.

23:57.770 --> 23:59.703
Just deliver the mimosas.

24:05.710 --> 24:07.778
Woman:
Come on in.

24:11.983 --> 24:13.951
Uh, where can I put this?

24:18.023 --> 24:19.857
Oh, my...

24:23.462 --> 24:26.096
Jane.

24:28.733 --> 24:29.633
Jane.

24:29.635 --> 24:30.868
Jane!

24:36.174 --> 24:37.741
Rafael:
Jane! Jane!

24:37.743 --> 24:39.743
Jane!

24:39.745 --> 24:40.845
Listen, stop.

24:40.847 --> 24:42.112
Let me explain.

24:42.114 --> 24:45.015
I told you I was a virgin,
and you had sex

24:45.017 --> 24:46.484
With the first girl
you could find.

24:46.486 --> 24:47.952
That is not true.

24:48.954 --> 24:51.222
Okay, so then what happened?

24:54.025 --> 24:55.726
(stammers)
I'm not sure.

24:55.728 --> 24:56.961
What?

24:56.963 --> 24:58.596
(stammers)

24:58.598 --> 25:00.664
I don't remember
anything from last night.

25:00.666 --> 25:02.733
(scoffs)

25:02.735 --> 25:04.835
Yeah, that's not
a good explanation.

25:10.675 --> 25:12.643
What happened last night?

25:12.645 --> 25:14.245
Oh, you know, the usual.

25:14.247 --> 25:16.647
Had a couple drinks,
came back here.

25:16.649 --> 25:18.983
D-did we, uh, did we have sex?

25:18.985 --> 25:21.151
Come on, yeah.

25:21.153 --> 25:22.820
Of course we did.

25:29.094 --> 25:31.595
They're fake, if that's
what you're wondering.

25:31.597 --> 25:32.830
No, actually wondering

25:32.832 --> 25:34.765
What my girlfriend is
doing between them.

25:42.674 --> 25:44.675
Well, thank you so much.

25:44.677 --> 25:45.976
This has been such a thrill.

25:45.978 --> 25:47.978
I don't know how I can
ever pay you back.

25:47.980 --> 25:49.780
You don't need to pay me back.

25:49.782 --> 25:52.249
When a friend asks me
for a favor, I cannot refuse.

25:52.251 --> 25:54.018
What friend?

25:54.020 --> 25:55.085
Rogelio.

25:55.087 --> 25:56.854
Why else do you think

25:56.856 --> 25:59.323
We did not make love
in the sound booth?

26:01.860 --> 26:03.227
It was embarrassing.

26:03.229 --> 26:04.728
Had he even heard me sing?

26:04.730 --> 26:06.931
Did he even see
my youtube videos?

26:06.933 --> 26:08.799
No, he hadn't.

26:08.801 --> 26:10.734
But I knew once he heard
you, he'd be a fan.
Ugh.

26:10.736 --> 26:12.036
(electric zap)
oh, come on.

26:12.038 --> 26:13.337
Latin lover narrator:
<i>A spark.</i>

26:13.339 --> 26:15.339
Don't be angry.

26:15.341 --> 26:16.907
It was a nice
thing I did.

26:16.909 --> 26:18.642
Wasn't it?

26:21.613 --> 26:23.747
Yeah, it was.

26:23.749 --> 26:25.849
So, what's
our problem?

26:25.851 --> 26:27.851
Latin lover narrator:
<i>The fact that she desperately</i>
<i>did not want</i>

26:27.853 --> 26:29.119
<i>To have feelings for him.</i>

26:29.121 --> 26:30.754
Nothing.

26:30.756 --> 26:32.189
There's no problem.

26:36.761 --> 26:39.863
Hey, aren't you teaching
this afternoon?

26:39.865 --> 26:42.733
Yeah, I have a few more minutes
before I have to leave.

26:42.735 --> 26:43.767
Oh, no.

26:43.769 --> 26:44.768
What happened?

26:44.770 --> 26:46.270
(sighs)

26:46.272 --> 26:48.272
You were right
about rafael, okay?

26:48.274 --> 26:50.975
Oh, no, honey, I'm sorry.

26:50.977 --> 26:52.276
I didn't want
to be right.

26:52.278 --> 26:55.379
I don't even know
what I was thinking.

26:55.381 --> 26:56.947
I mean,
we're so different.

26:56.949 --> 26:59.817
Trust me, hon,
I get it.

27:01.753 --> 27:04.388
Especially because it would
have been so perfect,

27:04.390 --> 27:06.991
If it had
worked out.

27:06.993 --> 27:09.059
Yeah, it really
would have.

27:12.797 --> 27:14.198
I need to talk to you.

27:14.200 --> 27:15.866
Is everything okay?

27:15.868 --> 27:17.067
I don't know.

27:17.069 --> 27:19.737
I don't know
if I should say something

27:19.739 --> 27:21.238
Or not say
something.
About what?

27:21.240 --> 27:23.674
Your sister.

27:23.676 --> 27:24.942
Well, then you should
definitely say something.

27:26.311 --> 27:30.681
She is having a
sort of breakdown.

27:30.683 --> 27:32.149
And I hate
saying this.

27:32.151 --> 27:35.719
But, given her history
and her mother...

27:35.721 --> 27:36.920
Rose,

27:36.922 --> 27:37.988
What happened?

27:39.991 --> 27:41.992
I went to go see her.

27:41.994 --> 27:43.427
To check in.

27:43.429 --> 27:46.230
Rafael, it
was awful.

27:46.232 --> 27:48.232
The things that she was
saying to me,

27:48.234 --> 27:52.236
All these... Sexual things.

27:52.238 --> 27:54.872
And I didn't know
how to respond.

27:54.874 --> 27:56.373
I didn't know what to do.

27:56.375 --> 27:58.008
It's okay.

27:58.010 --> 27:59.710
You did
the right thing

27:59.712 --> 28:01.879
By coming to me.

28:03.248 --> 28:06.784
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Ooh, not nice, rose.</i>

28:11.923 --> 28:13.791
All right, you know
the reading assignment--

28:13.793 --> 28:15.292
<i>The taming of the shrew.</i>
<i>Enjoy, and I know...</i>

28:15.294 --> 28:17.394
Student:
Who are you?

28:18.863 --> 28:20.864
It's really you.

28:20.866 --> 28:22.199
Jane the virgin.

28:22.201 --> 28:24.168
All right, that's enough.

28:24.170 --> 28:26.103
Get moving!

28:30.341 --> 28:32.910
We met this morning.

28:32.912 --> 28:34.812
Yes, I recall.

28:34.814 --> 28:37.448
Right. Look, uh...

28:37.450 --> 28:38.816
What you think happened,

28:38.818 --> 28:40.017
It didn't.

28:40.019 --> 28:41.118
Yeah, I was there.

28:41.120 --> 28:43.120
Something
obviously happened.

28:43.122 --> 28:47.024
No, I was paid to drug him and
make it seem like we had sex.

28:47.026 --> 28:48.125
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Oh, is that all?</i>

28:48.127 --> 28:49.126
What?

28:49.128 --> 28:51.495
I'm an escort.

28:51.497 --> 28:54.498
Uh, my manager
got me the gig.

28:54.500 --> 28:56.834
It was all online,
I don't even know who set it up.

28:56.836 --> 28:58.035
Oh, my god.

28:58.037 --> 29:02.039
Look, I only did it
because it was easy money.

29:02.041 --> 29:05.008
But then your boyfriend
told me

29:05.010 --> 29:07.244
That you're jane the virgin,

29:07.246 --> 29:10.013
And I'm a really
religious woman.

29:10.015 --> 29:13.917
Which I know is hard
to believe given, you know,

29:13.919 --> 29:15.085
What I do.

29:15.087 --> 29:17.087
Anyway,

29:17.089 --> 29:19.490
I'm really sorry.

29:20.458 --> 29:22.459
Okay.

29:22.461 --> 29:23.961
Thank you for
telling me that.

29:23.963 --> 29:24.962
Yeah.

29:24.964 --> 29:28.398
So...

29:28.400 --> 29:29.933
Can I have a hug?

29:29.935 --> 29:31.435
Excuse me?

29:31.437 --> 29:34.505
I could really use a miracle.

29:37.342 --> 29:38.408
I have a son.

29:39.978 --> 29:42.179
And I haven't seen him
in a while

29:42.181 --> 29:44.815
Due to a-a couple
of circumstances.

29:44.817 --> 29:47.518
I've been in some
bad situations, but...

29:47.520 --> 29:50.487
I really want to see him.

29:51.990 --> 29:55.492
And maybe if I hug you...

29:57.095 --> 29:59.029
I don't want
to give you false hope.

29:59.031 --> 30:01.999
I am not a religious messiah.

30:02.001 --> 30:04.067
What happened to me was
a medical mistake.

30:06.905 --> 30:09.873
But can I give
you a hug anyway?

30:10.809 --> 30:12.876
Yeah.

30:14.179 --> 30:17.247
I really hope you
get to see your son.

30:20.084 --> 30:23.320
(speaking spanish)

30:23.322 --> 30:26.323
They don't actually give awards
out to shows like this, do they?

30:26.325 --> 30:30.093
Well, y-you can't tell anything
from just one scene, okay?

30:30.095 --> 30:33.163
There's a...
There's a larger story.

30:37.001 --> 30:38.569
Anyway,

30:38.571 --> 30:40.404
They <i>do</i> give out awards,

30:40.406 --> 30:44.575
And I've actually booked
the afterparty here.

30:44.577 --> 30:45.876
In the hotel.

30:45.878 --> 30:48.412
How did you do that?

30:48.414 --> 30:50.414
One of the divas recovered
from extensive plastic surgery

30:50.416 --> 30:53.417
In one of our medical
recovery suites.

30:53.419 --> 30:55.419
I promised that secret
would never get out.

30:55.421 --> 30:59.022
And I thought you took this job
just to make rafael squirm.

30:59.024 --> 31:02.092
Well, the better the hotel does,

31:02.094 --> 31:04.094
The more money I make
in my divorce.

31:04.096 --> 31:08.265
It's always about money
with you, isn't it?

31:08.267 --> 31:11.869
Though setting rafael up
with that escort, that...

31:11.871 --> 31:13.503
That seems personal.

31:13.505 --> 31:16.073
True.

31:16.075 --> 31:19.076
I also despise him.

31:19.078 --> 31:23.080
And leaving you for him was
the biggest mistake of my life.

31:23.082 --> 31:24.982
Is that what you
want to hear?

31:24.984 --> 31:27.217
Well, it's true.

31:29.120 --> 31:31.255
I should get back
to my mother.

31:31.257 --> 31:32.589
Rafael:
<i>It had to have been petra.</i>

31:32.591 --> 31:35.592
She's the only person
crazy enough to set me up.

31:35.594 --> 31:37.327
So crazy.
You know,

31:37.329 --> 31:38.595
I'm just gonna
expedite her settlement.

31:38.597 --> 31:40.030
I don't want to deal
with it anymore.

31:40.032 --> 31:41.198
I want it to end
and I don't want it

31:41.200 --> 31:43.533
To get in the way of... Us.

31:43.535 --> 31:45.269
What "us"?

31:45.271 --> 31:47.137
Come on.

31:47.139 --> 31:48.372
Last night, our dinner...

31:48.374 --> 31:49.606
It was awful!

31:49.608 --> 31:51.141
(laughs)
I know and I'm sorry.

31:51.143 --> 31:54.044
I freaked out when you
told me you'd never had sex.

31:54.046 --> 31:55.112
And... I don't know.

31:55.114 --> 31:56.346
It was unexpected.

31:56.348 --> 31:58.515
And I acted like an idiot.

31:58.517 --> 32:00.517
And honestly,
once I thought about it,

32:00.519 --> 32:02.352
It doesn't even matter.

32:02.354 --> 32:04.254
You know, I'll wait
as long as I have to...

32:04.256 --> 32:05.555
I just...
It's not only that.

32:05.557 --> 32:07.224
Now, look what happened

32:07.226 --> 32:09.393
When you lost your job and
found out I was a virgin.

32:09.395 --> 32:11.128
You got to cut me
some slack, jane.

32:11.130 --> 32:13.130
That was a tough moment.
Yeah.

32:13.132 --> 32:15.065
Life is full of tough moments.

32:15.067 --> 32:16.700
You have to fight
for what you want.

32:17.936 --> 32:19.136
Look, I just think

32:19.138 --> 32:21.471
That maybe we read
too much into things

32:21.473 --> 32:23.407
Between us.

32:23.409 --> 32:25.075
We're having a baby.

32:25.077 --> 32:26.176
Let's focus on that.

32:28.246 --> 32:29.112
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And speaking</i>

32:29.114 --> 32:31.248
<i>Of not working out...</i>

32:31.250 --> 32:33.617
So, we should nail down a date
for dinner with my daughter.

32:36.254 --> 32:38.121
<i>Let it be known</i>

32:38.123 --> 32:41.158
<i>That at that moment,</i>
<i>xiomara prayed for a spark.</i>

32:41.160 --> 32:43.560
I don't think I should.

32:43.562 --> 32:45.128
Why?

32:45.130 --> 32:47.664
Look, you're a great guy.

32:47.666 --> 32:50.300
And because you're a great guy,

32:50.302 --> 32:52.235
I wanted it to work out.

32:53.438 --> 32:54.738
So I've been
ignoring the fact

32:54.740 --> 32:57.374
That there's
something missing here.

33:03.548 --> 33:05.182
What's going on?

33:05.184 --> 33:07.250
Please... Sit down, luisa.

33:07.252 --> 33:08.585
Who are you?

33:08.587 --> 33:10.120
My name is dr. Perez.

33:10.122 --> 33:12.089
Emilio:
Try to stay calm, luisa.

33:12.091 --> 33:13.557
What?

33:13.559 --> 33:15.125
What's going on?

33:15.127 --> 33:17.394
I'm so sorry, luisa.

33:17.396 --> 33:19.730
I had to tell them
what you were saying.

33:19.732 --> 33:22.199
Tell them what?

33:22.201 --> 33:24.534
About... Us?

33:24.536 --> 33:27.204
Ah... You mean our affair?

33:27.206 --> 33:28.438
See?

33:30.408 --> 33:31.608
Luisa?

33:31.610 --> 33:34.444
You're having
some sort of episode.

33:35.380 --> 33:38.148
Fantasizing about me.

33:38.150 --> 33:40.117
What?!

33:40.119 --> 33:41.518
What?!

33:41.520 --> 33:44.287
Luisa, you got to stay calm.
We were, we were lovers!

33:44.289 --> 33:45.555
I don't know what happened.
Rafael:
The doctor has

33:45.557 --> 33:47.391
Medications to give you.
She's lying!

33:47.393 --> 33:49.059
She's lying! Stop lying!

33:49.061 --> 33:50.293
I don't know what I did
to trigger this...

33:50.295 --> 33:52.262
The same thing happened
with her mother--

33:52.264 --> 33:53.230
A psychotic break.

33:53.232 --> 33:56.299
Stop lying! Stop lying!

33:56.301 --> 33:57.200
(all clamoring)

33:57.202 --> 33:58.468
Why are you lying?!

33:58.470 --> 34:00.303
Why are you doing this?!

34:00.305 --> 34:01.571
Stop!
Stop lying!

34:01.573 --> 34:03.206
Why are you doing this?!

34:03.208 --> 34:05.142
Oh!
Stop lying!

34:05.144 --> 34:06.209
Please!

34:06.211 --> 34:07.711
Liar!

34:14.485 --> 34:16.720
Emilio:
I have no choice.

34:16.722 --> 34:18.755
I have to commit her.

34:28.099 --> 34:30.700
Abuela, you ready for the
world premiere of mom's song?

34:30.702 --> 34:33.103
Oh, sorry.

34:33.105 --> 34:35.172
Whenever you're ready,
we'll head to the hotel.

34:35.174 --> 34:37.374
(whispers):
Mom.

34:37.376 --> 34:38.575
Is everything okay with abuela?

34:38.577 --> 34:39.709
She's in there
with the rosary again.

34:39.711 --> 34:41.278
Oh.
What is it?

34:41.280 --> 34:43.380
It's your lawsuit.

34:45.249 --> 34:47.818
Remember that time I forgot
to pay my parking ticket?

34:51.756 --> 34:54.391
I wasn't even thinking about
how she feels about court.

34:54.393 --> 34:56.293
If grandpa's family was so rich,

34:56.295 --> 34:57.627
Why aren't we rich?

35:18.416 --> 35:19.850
Why?

35:22.420 --> 35:24.421
Stupid immigration laws.

35:36.400 --> 35:37.701
And I get that, ma.

35:37.703 --> 35:39.769
And I'll be more careful.

35:39.771 --> 35:41.138
Latin lover narrator:
<i>It should be noted</i>

35:41.140 --> 35:42.472
<i>That was the last ticket</i>

35:42.474 --> 35:44.841
<i>Xiomara ever got.</i>

35:44.843 --> 35:46.676
Oh, I didn't even think.

35:46.678 --> 35:48.345
It's just a civil procedure.

35:48.347 --> 35:49.713
Yeah, and she knows that.

35:49.715 --> 35:51.181
And she's fine with it.

35:51.183 --> 35:52.816
But then petra started
acting all crazy,

35:52.818 --> 35:54.451
And the family's
so powerful...

35:54.453 --> 35:56.920
She's just nervous,
that's all.

36:01.492 --> 36:02.459
Wanted to see me?

36:02.461 --> 36:04.427
Yeah, go ahead and shut that.

36:08.166 --> 36:10.767
So, I've been thinking...

36:10.769 --> 36:12.869
About how you said
you made a mistake.

36:12.871 --> 36:15.372
And I agree.

36:15.374 --> 36:16.773
You did.

36:18.442 --> 36:20.877
(passionate moaning)

36:24.882 --> 36:26.416
Lachlan, I-I don't...

36:26.418 --> 36:28.485
Wait.

36:30.655 --> 36:32.856
I'm deleting it.

36:41.499 --> 36:43.233
I never stopped
missing you.

37:01.519 --> 37:03.820
(cell phone dings)

37:05.590 --> 37:07.591
I got an I.D.
On the picture I sent.

37:09.527 --> 37:11.428
The guy's a possible
serbian war criminal.

37:11.430 --> 37:13.496
What?

37:15.566 --> 37:18.435
What the hell does a serbian
have to do with sin rostro?

37:18.437 --> 37:21.538
I don't know.

37:21.540 --> 37:23.673
The guy's been awfully
quiet in there.

37:23.675 --> 37:25.408
I don't like this.

37:25.410 --> 37:27.477
(phone rings)
(sighs)

37:32.316 --> 37:35.752
Hello?

37:35.754 --> 37:38.755
Uh, no.
Yeah, this is rafael.

37:40.391 --> 37:41.891
What?

37:41.893 --> 37:44.561
All right, I'm gonna
go have luca put this on

37:44.563 --> 37:46.263
And you guys
grab a seat.

37:46.265 --> 37:48.665
Okay.
Oh, rogelio's here.

37:49.967 --> 37:52.736
I invited him to hear it.

37:52.738 --> 37:55.438
Since he's the one who set up
the recording session.

37:55.440 --> 37:56.906
Mm-hmm.

37:56.908 --> 37:59.009
Come on, ma.
Okay.

38:06.784 --> 38:08.485
(speaks spanish)

38:08.487 --> 38:09.853
Xiomara.

38:12.556 --> 38:14.524
So, where's mark?

38:14.526 --> 38:16.326
You mean marco?

38:16.328 --> 38:18.328
Is that not what I said?

38:18.330 --> 38:19.796
We broke up.

38:24.502 --> 38:26.670
But in case you were
thinking it had anything

38:26.672 --> 38:29.039
To do with you...
Latin lover narrator:
<i>It did. And he was.</i>

38:29.041 --> 38:31.007
...It didn't.

38:31.009 --> 38:33.576
Just because he wasn't right
doesn't mean you are.

38:33.578 --> 38:36.513
Of course.
I agree 100%.

38:36.515 --> 38:37.847
(music playing)

38:37.849 --> 38:40.517
Ah.

38:40.519 --> 38:42.085
Is that your song?

38:46.824 --> 38:48.892
Just beautiful.

38:55.833 --> 38:57.767
(petra moaning)

38:59.670 --> 39:01.471
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Hmm.</i>

39:01.473 --> 39:04.374
<i>I guess he didn't delete it</i>
<i>after all.</i>

39:11.549 --> 39:13.516
Housekeeping.

39:29.033 --> 39:30.533
He's gone.

39:30.535 --> 39:31.801
What the hell?

39:31.803 --> 39:33.870
Where'd he go?

39:35.740 --> 39:37.841
Jane.

39:37.843 --> 39:39.542
Did petra talk to you?

39:39.544 --> 39:42.412
Is that why you
withdrew the lawsuit?
What?

39:42.414 --> 39:44.814
No, I just got a...
I got a call from my lawyer

39:44.816 --> 39:46.583
Saying that you withdrew.

39:46.585 --> 39:49.419
I did, but that wasn't
because of petra.

39:49.421 --> 39:51.421
It was... It was...

39:51.423 --> 39:53.623
It was for my grandma.

39:57.495 --> 40:00.029
She's not a legal
resident in this country,

40:00.031 --> 40:02.932
And the whole thing was
making her nervous.

40:04.902 --> 40:07.771
And it's not only that.

40:09.106 --> 40:10.907
I was thinking about

40:10.909 --> 40:12.509
What my lawyer said in court,

40:12.511 --> 40:16.546
About how this baby
was not wanted.

40:16.548 --> 40:19.616
And I don't feel
like that anymore.

40:19.618 --> 40:22.852
So what am I doing this for,
really-- for the money?

40:22.854 --> 40:25.188
'cause that just feels ugly.

40:26.590 --> 40:28.758
Especially because
you are absolutely

40:28.760 --> 40:30.693
Going to take care of your
child, financially.

40:30.695 --> 40:31.895
Of course I am.

40:31.897 --> 40:33.596
I'm gonna need that in writing.

40:33.598 --> 40:35.665
Done.

40:38.702 --> 40:41.638
Wait, wh... What was it that
you thought petra told me?

40:41.640 --> 40:43.640
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And so rafael</i>

40:43.642 --> 40:45.542
<i>Finally told jane the truth.</i>

40:45.544 --> 40:48.545
I... Underwrote my sister's

40:48.547 --> 40:50.647
Medical malpractice insurance.

40:50.649 --> 40:53.550
So your lawsuit...

40:53.552 --> 40:55.585
You were actually suing me.

40:55.587 --> 40:57.520
What?

41:03.894 --> 41:05.995
I-I just didn't want to

41:05.997 --> 41:08.198
Affect your decision to sue.

41:09.500 --> 41:11.000
I had no idea.

41:11.002 --> 41:12.502
I know.

41:12.504 --> 41:14.971
I've also been thinking
about what you told me.

41:14.973 --> 41:17.040
About how I need
to fight for things.

41:17.042 --> 41:20.844
And you're right.
I do.

41:20.846 --> 41:22.679
So I'm gonna
work for lachlan.

41:22.681 --> 41:25.582
And petra,
as long as she's here.

41:27.751 --> 41:30.119
And I'm gonna fight
for you, too.

41:32.156 --> 41:34.557
Jane, this-this is...
This is hard.

41:34.559 --> 41:35.925
Look, we're doing
everything backwards.

41:35.927 --> 41:37.594
I mean, we're having
a baby and-and then

41:37.596 --> 41:39.162
We're going on our first date?

41:41.866 --> 41:43.666
But I want to be with you.

41:44.702 --> 41:46.069
And I'm not giving up.

41:58.616 --> 42:00.850
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Oh, if only it were that easy.</i>
