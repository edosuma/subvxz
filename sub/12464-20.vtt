00:04.304 --> 00:07.206
( squeaks )
ah, dad, sit down.

00:07.208 --> 00:09.475
They're about to stream
my music video worldwide.

00:09.477 --> 00:12.277
Sorry, liv,
just looking for
a place to sit.

00:12.279 --> 00:14.246
Ooh, here.

00:17.317 --> 00:19.818
Next month, I start filming
the blockbuster movie

00:19.820 --> 00:21.520
"space werewolves."
( squeals )

00:21.522 --> 00:23.622
I'm using that buzz
to launch my music career,

00:23.624 --> 00:25.758
So that means making
some really big changes.

00:25.760 --> 00:29.895
I got a new manager
and new boots.

00:29.897 --> 00:32.364
The manager's
the best part.

00:32.366 --> 00:34.666
But these boots!

00:34.668 --> 00:37.636
We met with the music
industry's top managers.

00:37.638 --> 00:40.239
We all decided to hire
becky bicklehoff.

00:40.241 --> 00:43.342
She represents
the biggest names
in music today.

00:43.344 --> 00:44.676
We've never heard
of any of them,

00:44.678 --> 00:46.912
But to be fair, the last
record we bought was...

00:46.914 --> 00:49.248
A record.

00:49.250 --> 00:51.984
( chuckles nervously )
I so hope you guys
like this.

00:51.986 --> 00:53.519
Becky told me
to trust her,

00:53.521 --> 00:55.287
But I'm a little worried.

00:55.289 --> 00:57.756
I wasn't completely
sold on this song.

00:57.758 --> 00:59.958
And what we shot
was so weird.

00:59.960 --> 01:01.794
Oh, look look.
It's on.

"froyoyolo"

09:52.125 --> 09:53.758
At my internet concert.

09:53.760 --> 09:56.027
Don't you have
to sing that song?

09:56.029 --> 09:58.330
I mean, the concert is called
"froyoyolo:

09:58.332 --> 10:00.465
Fro-no, she didn't, live."

10:00.467 --> 10:03.201
Right.

10:03.203 --> 10:04.502
I know, which is why

10:04.504 --> 10:07.172
I am secretly
writing my own song

10:07.174 --> 10:08.506
That is going to show everyone

10:08.508 --> 10:10.041
The kind of artist
that I want to be.

10:10.043 --> 10:11.876
And I'm gonna
sing that instead.

10:11.878 --> 10:15.113
That's really brave.
How's that going for you?

10:15.115 --> 10:17.182
Well, I've been
at it for hours

10:17.184 --> 10:21.286
And all I have done is
draw this hand-turkey!

10:21.288 --> 10:23.555
Please don't do
the dramatic bed flop.

10:23.557 --> 10:25.557
( gasps )

10:27.293 --> 10:29.127
What am I gonna do?

10:29.129 --> 10:32.030
Liv, just write
what you're feeling.

10:32.032 --> 10:33.832
Okay, no, that is not
nearly as easy

10:33.834 --> 10:35.100
As you're making it sound.
Have you ever tried writing

10:35.102 --> 10:36.134
Down your feelings?
No.

10:36.136 --> 10:37.502
- Yes.
- What?

10:37.504 --> 10:39.537
- What--
- spill!

10:40.873 --> 10:44.209
So I may or may not
have a secret poetry journal.

10:44.211 --> 10:46.044
But you can't tell anyone.

10:46.046 --> 10:48.179
<i>You </i> have a poetry journal?

10:48.181 --> 10:49.981
( gasps )
and it's sparkly?!

10:49.983 --> 10:51.149
Who are you?

10:51.151 --> 10:53.918
Gimme gimme gimme.

10:53.920 --> 10:55.453
No no no no.
No.

10:55.455 --> 10:56.554
You can't look.
It's private.

10:56.556 --> 10:59.391
But, um, if I can do it,
you can do it.

10:59.393 --> 11:03.495
And inspiration
is everywhere.

11:03.497 --> 11:05.563
Maddie had inspired me--

11:05.565 --> 11:08.400
Inspired me
to read her journal.

11:14.073 --> 11:17.976
Guess what I found when
I unrolled my yoga mat
this morning.

11:17.978 --> 11:23.114
Day two in
a year of romance.

11:23.116 --> 11:25.183
"if you were Thursday,

11:25.185 --> 11:28.219
I'd want every day
to be Thursday."

11:28.221 --> 11:31.423
Pete, how do you
come up with this stuff?

11:31.425 --> 11:32.624
( chuckles )

11:32.626 --> 11:34.426
How do I not?

11:34.428 --> 11:37.062
Thank you, honey.

11:38.230 --> 11:40.598
Thank you, son.

11:40.600 --> 11:43.401
How do  <i>you </i> come up
with this stuff?

11:43.403 --> 11:45.236
Lovey dovey lizard.

11:45.238 --> 11:47.205
I haven't played with
her since I was two.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.507
I forgot that
she could do this.

11:51.143 --> 11:52.243
( squeaky pitch )
if you were Thursday,

11:52.245 --> 11:54.145
I'd want every day
to be Thursday.

11:54.147 --> 11:56.114
( giggles )

11:56.116 --> 11:58.450
Dad's giving me a dollar

11:58.452 --> 12:00.485
For every love note
I write.

12:00.487 --> 12:04.055
And this stupid thing
says a million stupid things.

12:04.057 --> 12:06.624
I'm gonna be stupid rich.

12:09.095 --> 12:11.196
( laughs )
this is so great.

12:11.198 --> 12:12.197
I love working with you.

12:12.199 --> 12:13.531
Me too times two.

12:15.067 --> 12:17.535

12:17.537 --> 12:20.338

12:36.022 --> 12:41.259
Oh, sorry, "boss."
( laughs )

12:41.261 --> 12:42.293
I love being

12:42.295 --> 12:44.028
Call you my "boss."
( laughs )

12:44.030 --> 12:46.364
Yeah, first of all,
I'm not your "boss."

12:46.366 --> 12:49.200
I'm your  <i>boss.</i>

12:49.202 --> 12:51.603
I need you to

12:51.605 --> 12:54.172
Don't get me wrong.
I love that you work here.

12:54.174 --> 12:56.207
I love working here.

12:56.209 --> 12:59.144
I hate working here!

12:59.146 --> 13:03.448
But it would break his heart

13:03.450 --> 13:06.217
I hate her working here!

13:06.219 --> 13:09.420
But it would break her heart
if I told her, so...

13:09.422 --> 13:13.258
So you want to
slice mangos with me?

13:13.260 --> 13:14.692
I thought you'd never ask.

13:14.694 --> 13:16.294
( both laugh )

13:21.066 --> 13:23.334
"if your love
were my hair,

13:23.336 --> 13:25.436
I'd never cut it."

13:25.438 --> 13:27.205
You-- oh, you!

13:29.708 --> 13:31.509
Lizard:
If your love were my hair,

13:31.511 --> 13:35.413
I'd never cut it.
( giggles )

13:35.415 --> 13:37.315
Ka-ching.

13:38.384 --> 13:41.219
Lizard:
<i>Our love has</i>
<i>no expiration date.</i>

13:41.221 --> 13:42.620

13:45.724 --> 13:47.992
Dollar bill, y'all.

13:47.994 --> 13:50.128
Lizard:
<i>If you're my number one,</i>

13:50.130 --> 13:52.764
<i>Let me be your number two.</i>
<i>( giggles )</i>

13:59.104 --> 14:01.239
Oh!  Yay, you're finally home.

14:01.241 --> 14:02.440
<i>I've been</i>
<i>dying to see you.</i>

14:02.442 --> 14:04.642
Ooh, totally get that.

14:04.644 --> 14:06.044
Too much alone time
with joey?

14:08.047 --> 14:09.047
Yes, that.

14:09.049 --> 14:11.115
But also,
you were right.

14:11.117 --> 14:13.051
I found some inspiration.

14:13.053 --> 14:15.186
It took me a couple days,
but I'm really proud of it.

14:15.188 --> 14:16.254
I wrote a song.

14:16.256 --> 14:18.623
Oh, liv, that's great.

14:18.625 --> 14:20.158
I told you inspiration
was everywhere.

14:20.160 --> 14:21.192
What'd you write about?

14:21.194 --> 14:22.527
About how much
you missed me

14:22.529 --> 14:24.095
When I went away
to hollywood.

14:24.097 --> 14:26.097
Uh...

14:26.099 --> 14:27.799
Why is it about
my feelings?

14:27.801 --> 14:29.701
Because yours were
already written down.

14:29.703 --> 14:32.136
Yay-sies!

14:32.138 --> 14:34.672
I found a poem
in your journal and
I set it to music.

14:34.674 --> 14:38.176
You read my journal?!

14:38.178 --> 14:41.412
And that is why I write
my journal in elfish.

14:41.414 --> 14:43.114
Okay, maddie,

14:43.116 --> 14:44.249
I'm sorry I read
your journal,

14:44.251 --> 14:45.483
But before you get
all upset--

14:45.485 --> 14:48.186
No, liv, there's no before.
I'm upset!

14:48.188 --> 14:51.422
Oh, those are my own
private thoughts.

14:51.424 --> 14:53.291
Right, they were,
but now they're

14:53.293 --> 14:56.194
A bouncy memorable chorus
with an interesting bridge.

14:57.663 --> 14:59.230
I want to sing it
at my concert

14:59.232 --> 15:00.465
So that people
can know the real me.

15:00.467 --> 15:03.334
Okay, but it's not
the real you.

15:03.336 --> 15:05.403
It's the real me!
That you stole.

15:05.405 --> 15:07.272
Yeah, liv.

15:07.274 --> 15:09.374
Who died and made you
luthien tinuviel?

15:11.377 --> 15:13.211
Famous elf princess.

15:14.079 --> 15:17.148
Oh, come on,
don't you people read?

15:18.684 --> 15:20.718
Apparently, liv does.

15:20.720 --> 15:22.420
Other people's journals.

15:24.089 --> 15:26.524
- You can't use that song.
- Wha--?

15:26.526 --> 15:29.827
Maddie, you can't just
put sparkles on something

15:29.829 --> 15:32.163
And expect me
not to touch it!

15:35.134 --> 15:37.669
( forced ) I'm so glad
that I can help you

15:37.671 --> 15:42.540
Build a magical rainbow
to your froyo dream!

15:49.281 --> 15:51.549
( shouts )
have a peppy day!

15:57.690 --> 16:00.191
I am the peppiest rainbow!

16:00.193 --> 16:02.827
I'm dead inside.

16:04.563 --> 16:06.664
- Uh, maddie.
- Yeah.

16:06.666 --> 16:07.732
Working with you is--

16:07.734 --> 16:09.600
( forced )
is so great.

16:09.602 --> 16:11.736
So great.

16:11.738 --> 16:13.137
- Yeah, so you're fired.
- Um, I quit.

16:13.139 --> 16:15.473
( gasps )
yay!  Yes!

16:17.142 --> 16:19.811
Oh, sure, now you're peppy.

16:22.348 --> 16:24.716
I do wish we could
spend more time together

16:24.718 --> 16:25.917
Before I leave though.

16:25.919 --> 16:29.587
I guess I could quit
my ukulele class.

16:29.589 --> 16:32.657
You would do that for me?

16:32.659 --> 16:34.826
Of course.

16:34.828 --> 16:36.627
After you leave, I can't
imagine myself saying,

16:36.629 --> 16:38.830
"I wish I'd spent more
time with my ukulele."

16:40.299 --> 16:42.200
Big mistake, man.

16:43.235 --> 16:45.203
I quit the bagpipes
for a guy.

16:45.205 --> 16:47.205
Regret it every day.

16:51.243 --> 16:53.478
"sunrise, you...

16:53.480 --> 16:56.214
Sunset-- the perfect day."

16:56.216 --> 16:59.250
Oh, pete, just when I think
you can't top yourself, you do.

16:59.252 --> 17:01.252
- ( chuckles )
- ( giggles )

17:01.254 --> 17:03.855
Well, when you have the most
beautiful woman in the world

17:03.857 --> 17:06.624
As inspiration,
the words just--

17:06.626 --> 17:08.393
They just...

17:12.631 --> 17:14.232
Well, you know.

17:15.601 --> 17:17.602
Just so surprising

17:17.604 --> 17:20.271
'cause you never did stuff
like this when we were dating

17:20.273 --> 17:21.906
Or when I was pregnant
with the twins

17:21.908 --> 17:23.975
Or when parker was two.

17:23.977 --> 17:26.377
And I gave him this!

17:28.247 --> 17:31.582
Why are you holding up
some stupid lizard?

17:31.584 --> 17:34.952
I found your little cupid
while I was cleaning.

17:34.954 --> 17:37.522
"sunrise, you,

17:37.524 --> 17:40.391
<i>Sunset... Hee-hee--</i>
<i>the perfect day."</i>

17:43.228 --> 17:46.531
I paid you for
original material.

17:46.533 --> 17:49.000
You were paying him?!

17:49.002 --> 17:52.303
Well, yeah, but I didn't know
he was ripping off a lizard.

17:52.305 --> 17:54.906
Pete rooney,
you need to say

17:54.908 --> 17:56.674
Something romantic
to me right now.

17:56.676 --> 17:58.009
Don't look at him.

18:00.345 --> 18:03.381
Um...

18:03.383 --> 18:04.682
I like your face.

18:07.419 --> 18:08.486
Really?

18:09.621 --> 18:11.422
At least you know
he wrote it.

18:16.762 --> 18:19.464
This place is electric, man.

18:21.500 --> 18:22.667
All right, liv.

18:22.669 --> 18:24.969
The live stream
starts in 30 seconds.

18:24.971 --> 18:27.004
And there're millions
of people waiting to watch.

18:27.006 --> 18:29.340
- Aah.
- It's froyo time.

18:32.444 --> 18:34.745
Becky, this just really
doesn't feel right to me.

18:34.747 --> 18:36.347
Of course it doesn't.

18:40.452 --> 18:42.820
Now it's froyo time!

18:44.323 --> 18:45.623
Okay.

18:45.625 --> 18:48.993
<i>( applause )</i>

18:52.698 --> 18:54.031
Maddie said I couldn't
sing her song,

18:54.033 --> 18:56.801
Which meant that I had
to sing "froyoyolo,"

18:56.803 --> 18:59.370
Choke back my tears,
