00:00.846 --> 00:02.374
Previously on Empire...

00:02.375 --> 00:05.026
Lucious Lyon is my father.

00:05.027 --> 00:07.138
Leah, it's time
for you to take a break.

00:07.162 --> 00:10.041
Are you going to sit there
and let them lock me up?

00:10.065 --> 00:11.876
MTA Bank of Panama.

00:11.900 --> 00:13.912
Money disappears from Empire,

00:13.936 --> 00:15.880
and ends up in your Panama account.

00:15.904 --> 00:17.015
You a regular here, Mr. Lyon?

00:17.039 --> 00:19.150
- And you are?
- Damon Cross.

00:19.174 --> 00:21.820
- I'm married.
- I hope he knows how lucky he is.

00:21.844 --> 00:24.155
I'm a Lyon, and I'm done
apologizing for that.

00:24.179 --> 00:26.858
Empire was built on people's pain.

00:26.882 --> 00:28.159
Our future is now.

02:13.655 --> 02:17.001
a new grenade blows up
in my damn face.

02:17.025 --> 02:18.937
I didn't know that this was my son.

02:18.961 --> 02:20.260
I-I didn't know that.

02:21.296 --> 02:23.107
"It's not my fault"

02:23.131 --> 02:24.509
and "I didn't know"

02:24.533 --> 02:25.944
is two different things, Lucious.

02:25.968 --> 02:28.947
Are you really judging me right now?

02:28.971 --> 02:32.383
I thought no matter what,
we had each other's back.

02:32.407 --> 02:34.185
That's what I want, Lucious.

02:34.209 --> 02:35.987
Hello? That's what I want.

02:36.011 --> 02:37.655
But we got to start doing things

02:37.679 --> 02:39.657
a lot different around here, 'cause...

02:39.681 --> 02:41.726
Different? What the hell are you
talking about, different?

02:41.750 --> 02:44.662
Everybody that ever gained anything

02:44.686 --> 02:47.699
gained at somebody else's pain.

Well, where did you get
that little nugget from, huh?

02:50.525 --> 02:52.737
Your evil son?

02:52.761 --> 02:55.006
He looks just like you.

02:55.030 --> 02:57.875
How dare you say
something like that to me?

02:57.899 --> 02:59.377
- Why? 'Cause it's the truth, huh?
- Truth?

02:59.401 --> 03:01.179
- It hurts? You don't...
- No, you want the truth?

03:01.203 --> 03:05.483
The truth is that you and I have
busted our ass for this family.

03:05.507 --> 03:10.021

He's already back in London,
back to work.

04:33.495 --> 04:35.673
- Covering some war. Hey, Mom.
- Hey, baby.

04:35.697 --> 04:38.142
I'm so sorry.

04:38.166 --> 04:39.577
You-you know, you can...

04:39.601 --> 04:41.145
you can go after Kai if you want to.

04:41.169 --> 04:43.014
I'll totally understand.

04:43.038 --> 04:44.749
Ma, I made a...

04:44.773 --> 04:46.918
a promise to be here
for the family, so I'm good.

04:46.942 --> 04:49.287
I just... I need to get back
to work, you know?

04:49.311 --> 04:52.123
Okay, good, 'cause I need you
more now than ever.

04:52.147 --> 04:55.093
I am trying to convince your daddy

04:55.117 --> 04:57.962
that we have to start
doing things different.

04:57.986 --> 04:59.263
Course we have to.

04:59.287 --> 05:02.100
- Yes.
- Ma, I didn't give up my man

05:02.124 --> 05:03.634
and-and God knows all that you gave up

05:03.658 --> 05:05.136
just so that Empire
can eat us up alive again.

05:05.160 --> 05:08.539
No, we got to be better.

05:08.563 --> 05:10.842
Do we even know
what "better" looks like, Jamal?

05:10.866 --> 05:12.143
I don't know.

05:12.167 --> 05:13.611
But I'll you this.

05:13.635 --> 05:16.481
- We gonna figure it out.
- That's right.

05:16.505 --> 05:19.517
Because I can't go back
to knocking people down

05:19.541 --> 05:21.185
just to build us up.

05:21.209 --> 05:23.443
Like you said,
we are better than that.

05:24.713 --> 05:26.379
We're Lyons.

05:37.225 --> 05:38.870
A little something

05:38.894 --> 05:41.639
for your first day back at work.

05:41.663 --> 05:42.874
What is this?

05:42.898 --> 05:45.977
Quincy helped me pick it out.

05:46.001 --> 05:48.513
Teri, I don't want you to spend
this much money.

05:48.537 --> 05:51.571
I'm just trying to say thank you.

05:57.846 --> 06:00.358
Wow.

06:04.953 --> 06:06.986
Wow.

06:08.857 --> 06:12.659
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

06:15.030 --> 06:18.576
You know, I'm, uh, kind of
excited to get back to Empire.

06:18.600 --> 06:20.878
- Yeah?
- Yeah, yeah, yes.

06:20.902 --> 06:24.048
First time in a... in a very long time

06:24.072 --> 06:25.917
my whole family's on the same page.

06:25.941 --> 06:28.619
You know, ready to do whatever
we have to do to succeed.

06:28.643 --> 06:31.255
Sounds like you're going to war.

06:31.279 --> 06:32.912
In a way, we are.

06:36.918 --> 06:39.085
Thank you for this, love.

06:41.089 --> 06:42.956
Dr. Miller.

06:43.959 --> 06:45.692
Yes, sir.

06:46.728 --> 06:48.573
Okay.

06:48.597 --> 06:50.575
No, I-I got it.

06:50.599 --> 06:52.777
Yeah. Thank you, Doc.

06:52.801 --> 06:54.779
Test results?

06:56.304 --> 06:58.649
- What-What'd he say?
- It's nothing.

06:58.673 --> 07:01.452
A bloody nose from a burst blood vessel.

07:01.476 --> 07:04.956
Oh, but he also said
to, uh, tell Nurse Teri...

07:04.980 --> 07:06.279
What?

07:07.282 --> 07:08.881
Stop worrying.

07:10.352 --> 07:12.330
- Can you do that?
- I'll try.

07:13.655 --> 07:15.233
When finished,

07:15.257 --> 07:17.335
lay pamphlets upside down
on the table.

07:17.359 --> 07:19.070
Do we have to listen to all of this?

07:19.094 --> 07:21.239
I mean, the focus group is
telling us what we already know.

07:21.263 --> 07:23.241
Okay, I don't know, man. Let's just...

07:23.265 --> 07:24.575
let's just be quiet. I want to hear.

07:24.599 --> 07:25.676
It's just not the same.

07:25.700 --> 07:27.111
Not as good as it was, man.

07:27.135 --> 07:28.446
Plus, they've been snitching on us.

07:28.470 --> 07:29.981
No Empire track is worth all that.

07:30.005 --> 07:31.148
Especially not with that generic music

07:31.172 --> 07:32.783
they've been dropping.

07:32.807 --> 07:34.907
- Where's Lucious Lyon?
- You know where he is.

07:36.211 --> 07:37.822
Out making babies
behind his wife's back.

07:48.023 --> 07:49.534
Good afternoon, everybody.

07:49.558 --> 07:51.102
Ooh, it's Lucious Lyon.

07:51.126 --> 07:52.537
Yeah, it's me.

07:52.561 --> 07:54.605
And I heard everything y'all said.

07:54.629 --> 07:55.773
I love you, Lucious.

07:55.797 --> 07:58.276
- I love you, too.
- I am so sorry.

07:58.300 --> 08:00.378
- Bet you are.
- Man, you know I was just playing.

08:00.402 --> 08:02.380
And that didn't sound
like y'all loved us back there.

08:02.404 --> 08:04.515
But I understand. I mean, Empire

08:04.539 --> 08:06.784
has lost its way.

08:06.808 --> 08:09.487
Done more than lose our way.
We've lost your trust.

08:09.511 --> 08:11.489
So, hey, hey,
is-is Cookie back there, too?

08:11.513 --> 08:12.690
Yeah, we want to see her.

08:12.714 --> 08:14.058
- Yeah.
- Where's she at?

08:14.082 --> 08:16.027
Hey, y'all.

08:18.186 --> 08:19.463
Now, with...

08:19.487 --> 08:21.232
without me at the helm,

08:21.256 --> 08:23.901
Empire managed to fail you miserably.

08:23.925 --> 08:25.503
But y'all ain't got to worry

08:25.527 --> 08:27.247
about none of that no more,
'cause I'm back.

08:28.663 --> 08:31.375
We are back.

08:31.399 --> 08:33.376
Look, I know y'all have
been hearing some nonsense.

08:33.400 --> 08:36.034
I want you to know it's not true.

08:37.205 --> 08:39.517
Lucious and I are good.

08:39.541 --> 08:40.751
And we will restore

08:40.775 --> 08:42.775
your faith in us again.

08:43.745 --> 08:45.690
Thank you.

08:45.714 --> 08:48.414
Thank you.

08:49.584 --> 08:51.651
Yeah, baby, thank you
for having my back.

08:53.755 --> 08:55.733
I don't have a choice.

08:55.757 --> 08:58.224
This is half my company, too.

09:04.705 --> 09:06.316
Maybe y'all don't know,
but analytics are dead.

09:06.340 --> 09:07.873
Dead!

09:09.109 --> 09:10.353
Dad.

09:13.375 --> 09:14.986
We are Empire.

09:15.010 --> 09:18.569
We're the best music label
in the whole damn world.

09:18.570 --> 09:21.672
And anybody that's here
that don't recognize that,

09:21.673 --> 09:24.618
you need to get the hell out
of here right now!

09:24.642 --> 09:26.954
Okay, let me translate

09:26.978 --> 09:29.290
for my husband's dramatic display.

09:29.314 --> 09:31.425
What he's saying is that Empire's

09:31.449 --> 09:33.460
going to be new and improved, y'all.

09:33.484 --> 09:34.829
Yes.

09:34.853 --> 09:36.430
Cookie and Lucious, Empire's founders,

09:36.454 --> 09:38.432
are now co-CEOs,

09:38.456 --> 09:40.434
and with me as their partner,

09:40.458 --> 09:41.902
I will be your COO.

09:41.926 --> 09:43.838
And I'll resume my role as your CFO.

09:43.862 --> 09:47.007
And Jamal is our new
Chairman of Music Development.

09:47.031 --> 09:48.309
Thanks for staying
with the family, son.

09:48.333 --> 09:50.311
Family first, music always.

09:50.335 --> 09:52.112
So, we gonna crank out
some hits, y'all.

09:52.136 --> 09:54.081
Amen. Now, as y'all know,

09:54.105 --> 09:58.285
our music comes from our heart,
not from a hard drive.

09:58.309 --> 10:01.088
And therefore, my son Hakeem Lyon

10:01.112 --> 10:02.122
is gonna make sure

10:02.146 --> 10:05.426
that Empire stays on the creative edge

10:05.450 --> 10:08.963
and ahead of all trends with him
as our Creative Director.

10:08.987 --> 10:10.331
We got you.

10:10.355 --> 10:11.395
- We got him, right?
- Yes.

10:12.457 --> 10:14.523
Yeah, we got him.

10:15.368 --> 10:17.012
And my sister from another mister,

10:17.036 --> 10:18.680
Ms. Becky Williams,

10:18.704 --> 10:20.549
will remain SVP of A&R.

10:20.573 --> 10:22.217
Her instincts are undeniable.

10:22.241 --> 10:24.553
Mmm. Definitely undeniable. I got you.

10:24.577 --> 10:27.723
As my lovely wife said so eloquently,

10:27.747 --> 10:30.259
Empire is new and improved.

10:30.283 --> 10:31.393
So I want y'all to go out there

10:31.417 --> 10:32.527
with your hearts, with your love,

10:32.551 --> 10:35.397
with your passion and make some music,

10:35.421 --> 10:36.865
'cause that's what we do.

10:36.889 --> 10:38.166
Okay,

10:38.190 --> 10:39.935
and make some money, too. Come on.

10:39.959 --> 10:41.770
Yes.

10:41.794 --> 10:45.540
Come talk to me.

10:45.564 --> 10:46.942
Okay, I don't to admit this,

10:46.966 --> 10:48.543
but you actually pulled this off.

10:48.567 --> 10:50.712
- No, we pulled this off.
- That's true.

10:50.736 --> 10:53.515
And even though the Lyons are back,

10:53.539 --> 10:58.120
I just want to make sure
that you still have my back.

10:58.144 --> 10:59.955
As long as you have my back.
Come on now.

10:59.979 --> 11:01.189
No question.

11:01.213 --> 11:03.025
- Now, let's get to work.
- Okay.

11:03.049 --> 11:05.527
During this re-launch,
image is everything.

11:05.551 --> 11:07.696
I want every Empire artist

11:07.720 --> 11:10.732
everywhere that's worth being seen.

11:10.756 --> 11:12.401
Fashion Week.

11:12.425 --> 11:14.469
- Bitch.
- Bitch.

11:14.493 --> 11:16.805
- It's Fashion Week.
- Fashion week.

11:16.829 --> 11:17.670
Okay, I have the perfect dress.

11:17.670 --> 11:18.607
Yeah. Okay. But it's
not about you, though.

11:18.631 --> 11:20.375
It's always about me, don't do that.

11:20.399 --> 11:22.210
What was that about?

11:22.234 --> 11:23.478
Hey, guys. That speech was awesome.

11:23.502 --> 11:25.580
Everybody's really hyped up.
It's great.

11:25.604 --> 11:27.316
Yeah, that's the point.

11:27.340 --> 11:29.551
Do you guys have, like, a minute
or two, maybe we could talk?

11:29.575 --> 11:32.054
A minute or two? That seems like

11:32.078 --> 11:33.822
a mighty long time for a chick

11:33.846 --> 11:36.158
who thought recording
in our living room was cute.

11:36.182 --> 11:37.759
Cookie, look.

11:37.783 --> 11:40.495
When I left LFM, it was just
a business decision.

11:40.519 --> 11:43.298
- It was nothing personal, I promise.
- Mm-mm.

11:43.322 --> 11:45.901
Now, what happens
when we drag your little ass

11:45.925 --> 11:48.136
out that door by your
pretty little feet, hmm?

11:48.160 --> 11:49.805
I'm sorry, what?

11:49.829 --> 11:53.308
Hah! Now you see how fast
that got personal.

11:53.332 --> 11:57.012
If you and your disloyal
vocal cords makes us some money,

11:57.036 --> 11:59.414
guess what? You get to stay.

11:59.438 --> 12:03.841
But if you don't make any money,
you got to kick rocks. Clear?

12:04.810 --> 12:06.154
Yeah. Very.

12:06.178 --> 12:08.423
So why are you still sitting here?

12:08.447 --> 12:09.524
Come on. Let's make some money!

12:09.548 --> 12:11.960
Chop, chop. Hmm.

12:11.984 --> 12:14.296
Good.

12:14.320 --> 12:17.466
When did you become so damn forgiving?

12:17.490 --> 12:19.768
Didn't you say I had to "be better"?

12:19.792 --> 12:21.636
Just a little bit.

12:21.660 --> 12:24.439
Oh. Give me this bat.

12:24.463 --> 12:26.508
Nah, I get it, I get it.

12:26.532 --> 12:28.599
All right.

12:29.802 --> 12:32.948
Hey, Devon. You all right?

12:32.972 --> 12:35.884
Look. I want to be a part
of New Empire.

12:35.908 --> 12:38.453
Well, you will be, you're
managed by LFM, remember?

12:38.477 --> 12:41.490
Listen, Jamal is definitely
gonna want to put you

12:41.514 --> 12:42.991
in the studio with Empire
Artists, so don't worry.

12:43.015 --> 12:44.359
Look, my label ain't having it, man.

12:44.383 --> 12:46.328
All right? No co-writes, no features.

12:46.352 --> 12:48.296
None of that. No collabs.

12:48.320 --> 12:50.065
Not until my debut.

12:50.089 --> 12:51.466
Well, I'll-I'll check
'on that for you, bro.

12:51.490 --> 12:52.834
- You can try, but...
- Brother.

12:52.858 --> 12:55.192
I'll check on that for you. Okay?

12:56.262 --> 12:59.096
- I got you.
- All right.

13:05.004 --> 13:07.482
I'm thinking 18 months, minimum,

13:07.506 --> 13:10.252
before fans believe Empire
is Empire again.

13:10.276 --> 13:12.487
Financially, the road
is longer and bumpier.

13:12.511 --> 13:14.055
Kingsley made bad investments

13:14.079 --> 13:17.025
and took on considerable debt.

13:17.049 --> 13:19.094
I've sketched out
a five-year solvency plan.

13:19.118 --> 13:21.863
- Wait. Five years?
- The company's a financial mess, Pop.

13:21.887 --> 13:24.332
Yeah, well, why can't Patel
pump some money into this?

13:24.356 --> 13:25.767
That's not gonna happen.

13:25.791 --> 13:27.536
Well, what about the money
your ex-husband took?

13:27.560 --> 13:29.938
Lord, I've been there. Done that.

13:29.962 --> 13:32.007
I couldn't convince
the Panamanian bank

13:32.031 --> 13:33.897
that the money Eddie deposited
was mine.

13:34.900 --> 13:36.945
I mean, Empire's.

13:36.969 --> 13:38.914
- Of course.
- Of course.

13:38.938 --> 13:42.105
So here, my legacy is just
weighing in the balance.

13:43.576 --> 13:45.353
I don't care how much money it costs.

13:45.377 --> 13:46.788
We need to fix this, ASAP.

13:46.812 --> 13:49.279
I need some air.

13:56.889 --> 13:58.433
Hey. I was just
on my way up to see you.

13:58.457 --> 13:59.901
The nursing home called
about your mom.

13:59.925 --> 14:01.636
Yeah, I ain't got time.

14:01.660 --> 14:03.572
I'll need to set up a meeting
with Damon Cross, man.

14:03.596 --> 14:04.773
Whoa, whoa, Damon Cross?

14:04.797 --> 14:06.308
A meeting about what?

14:06.332 --> 14:09.578
I did my research after that
little poker game.

14:09.602 --> 14:11.546
He's got a nice little
cleaning business, don't he?

14:11.570 --> 14:12.948
Look, I know who he is, you know?

14:12.972 --> 14:14.316
What-what's that got to do with us?

14:14.340 --> 14:17.219
Yeah, I also know you used
to work for him.

14:17.243 --> 14:20.155
Now, I assume you know
how to contact him?

14:20.179 --> 14:23.124
I did my research.

14:23.148 --> 14:24.993
As your attorney, I'm advising
you not to meet with this guy.

14:25.017 --> 14:26.895
- Let's just do...
- As your employer,

14:26.919 --> 14:29.498
I'm telling you, set up
a meeting with Damon Cross.

14:29.522 --> 14:30.932
He owes me.

14:30.956 --> 14:32.801
I'm going to collect.

14:32.825 --> 14:35.826
Thanks, Thirst.

14:37.830 --> 14:40.664
Cookie, um...

14:42.601 --> 14:44.312
What's all this?

14:44.336 --> 14:46.448
Uh, I-I couldn't remember
whether you liked regular,

14:46.472 --> 14:48.283
almond or soy milk in your coffee,

14:48.307 --> 14:49.351
so I brought you all three.

14:49.375 --> 14:50.852
Nah, you're a little too extra.

14:50.876 --> 14:53.188
Look. Um, uh, Cookie, um...

14:53.212 --> 14:55.824
I was really inspired by what
you guys said today.

14:55.848 --> 14:58.326
Look, I have a lot of ideas
for Empire, okay? And I was

14:58.350 --> 15:00.362
hoping that we could talk about
maybe an elevated position

15:00.386 --> 15:02.631
- like a choreographer?
- Okay. Ba-boop, boop, boop, boop.

15:02.655 --> 15:05.133
You've been with me for less
than a month

15:05.157 --> 15:07.168
and you're already expecting
a promotion?

15:07.192 --> 15:08.703
I have so much more to offer.

15:08.727 --> 15:11.206
Oh. Very ambitious of you.

15:11.230 --> 15:13.675
Okay. Why don't you elevate your ass

15:13.699 --> 15:15.210
on up to Porsha's office

15:15.234 --> 15:17.868
and discuss all your
little ideas with her?

15:22.207 --> 15:24.619
Oh, I don't-I don't get coffee
now, huh?

15:24.643 --> 15:27.856
Okay. Petty.

15:35.988 --> 15:38.800
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:41.160 --> 15:44.472
So... You know that your niece
and nephew have been begging

15:44.496 --> 15:46.474
to see their Uncle Mal
and Uncle Kai-Kai.

15:46.498 --> 15:47.842
Where y'all been at?

15:47.866 --> 15:50.412
Oh. Uh...

15:50.436 --> 15:54.516
Uncle Kai-Kai has... gone bye-bye.

15:54.540 --> 15:57.085
I'm so sorry, Jamal. I didn't know.

15:57.109 --> 15:58.853
It's all good, you know?

15:58.877 --> 16:00.689
Just gotta stay grinding.

16:00.713 --> 16:04.025
Got to stay focused
on the task at hand.

16:04.049 --> 16:06.895
But you know
about something like that.

16:06.919 --> 16:09.331
That's actually what
I was calling you about.

16:09.355 --> 16:12.701
Empire's gonna need straight
hits out the gate, you know?

16:12.725 --> 16:14.269
So I've been working
on a bunch of things,

16:14.293 --> 16:16.705
and this one situation I have,

16:16.729 --> 16:18.673
I just need a strong female vocal.

16:18.697 --> 16:20.909
I'm your girl.

16:20.933 --> 16:22.577
You haven't even heard it yet, but...

16:22.601 --> 16:24.379
I don't have to hear it. I trust you.

16:24.403 --> 16:27.048
And plus, I really appreciate
you showing me love,

16:27.072 --> 16:30.218
- even after all the...
- Hey.

16:30.242 --> 16:32.087

- Yeah.

16:47.559 --> 16:50.305
Everyone.

16:50.329 --> 16:52.107
- Mr. Damon Cross.
- It's good to see you again, brother.

16:52.131 --> 16:53.908
Well, yeah. It's hard to recognize you

16:53.932 --> 16:55.210
when you ain't dodging bullets, man.

16:55.234 --> 16:57.134
- Ah.
- Giselle Sims.

16:58.470 --> 16:59.581
It's nice to meet you.

16:59.605 --> 17:00.882
And this is my wife...

17:00.906 --> 17:02.317
We met... At the Moët.

17:02.341 --> 17:03.885
Wait, when did we go to the Moët?

17:03.909 --> 17:05.753
"We" didn't.

17:05.778 --> 17:08.589
I mean, everyone knows
the amazing Cookie Lyon

17:08.614 --> 17:10.290
and no one could forget meeting you,

17:10.315 --> 17:12.394
but I think you have me confused
with another brother.

17:12.417 --> 17:14.851
No, no, no. At the elevator.

17:16.121 --> 17:19.233
Never mind, it'll come back to you.

17:19.258 --> 17:21.770
All right, well, let's get down
to some business, all right?

17:21.794 --> 17:23.905
So how can I help you?

17:23.929 --> 17:25.573
Well, a recently departed friend

17:25.597 --> 17:27.776
was siphoning a great deal
of money from Empire.

17:27.800 --> 17:32.147
So now, our money is sitting in
an offshore account.

17:32.171 --> 17:34.783
And we need someone with
a certain amount of influence

17:34.807 --> 17:38.953
over the Panamanian banking
community to help us.

17:38.977 --> 17:42.924
I appreciate the consideration,
but if I can accommodate you,

17:42.948 --> 17:44.492
how soon could you be on a plane?

17:44.516 --> 17:46.261
You know, this is not gonna work
without an Empire boss.

17:46.285 --> 17:48.797
Well, Lucious has interviews
back-to-back

17:48.821 --> 17:50.699
and it wouldn't be a good look
if he just disappeared

17:50.723 --> 17:53.101
in the middle of our rebranding,
so I'll go.

17:53.125 --> 17:56.304
No, I don't think it's a good
look for Eddie's ex to go again.

17:56.328 --> 17:58.807
So I... I should go.

17:58.831 --> 18:00.975
- No, you don't need to.
- Yeah, I should.

18:00.999 --> 18:04.012
Well, that's if Mr. Cross is up
for the challenge?

18:04.036 --> 18:05.980
Well, I'm always up for a challenge.

18:06.004 --> 18:07.716
I guess we got a deal.

18:07.740 --> 18:10.746

18:17.504 --> 18:20.388

Loyalty is highly regarded
among the Samurai.

18:23.324 --> 18:24.968
Samson, all we're asking

18:24.992 --> 18:26.859
is that you loosen the reigns
a little bit.

18:28.629 --> 18:31.041
It's an original Takeda Shingen.

18:31.065 --> 18:32.976
To me, it's priceless.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.512
It represents my warrior spirit.

18:35.536 --> 18:38.816
We just want Devon to record

18:38.840 --> 18:41.518
a couple of songs with Empire artists.

18:41.542 --> 18:43.275
And you know they'll be hits.

18:45.213 --> 18:47.079
It's a win-win.

18:56.324 --> 18:58.502
Look, Andre.

21:15.383 --> 21:16.560
Did we have an appointment?

21:16.584 --> 21:18.762
You know, when I left here earlier,

21:18.786 --> 21:20.397
I thought to myself,

21:20.421 --> 21:22.532
there must be something
I neglected to offer.

21:22.556 --> 21:25.569
Look, kid, maybe you missed the
memo while you were locked up,

21:25.593 --> 21:28.572
but begging is still unbecoming.

21:28.596 --> 21:31.541
Let's test that theory.

21:31.565 --> 21:32.998
Shall we?

21:34.568 --> 21:38.504
- What the hell are you doing?!
- Sit your ass down. Sit down!

21:44.578 --> 21:47.090
Samurais were clever.

21:47.114 --> 21:50.460
They knew how to deceptively
disarm their enemy.

21:50.484 --> 21:52.696
You, sir, are not.

21:52.720 --> 21:55.599
Aah!

21:55.623 --> 21:57.467
But you very well could be.

21:57.491 --> 22:00.137
- Put the sword down.
- Begging is unbecoming, remember?

22:01.595 --> 22:03.707
Your father must be real proud.

22:03.731 --> 22:07.110
His Ivy League son, following
in his thuggish footsteps.

22:07.134 --> 22:09.446
My father moves out
of necessity for his clients.

22:09.470 --> 22:11.748
Can you say the same, Samson?

22:11.772 --> 22:14.451
- What are you getting at, Lyon?
- I'm talking about the escorts

22:14.475 --> 22:16.253
you expense to your artists' accounts.

22:16.277 --> 22:18.789
You have them paying for your
little call girls and call boys.

22:18.813 --> 22:20.290
That's ridiculous!

22:20.314 --> 22:22.214
Not according to your ex-wife,
it's not.

22:23.284 --> 22:25.128
You know, it's incredible

22:25.152 --> 22:27.898
how a few dollars can jog
a scorned woman's memory.

22:27.922 --> 22:29.332
Stop!

22:31.926 --> 22:33.158
You can use Devon.

22:34.161 --> 22:36.128
I asked for that this morning.

22:37.331 --> 22:38.742
You remember how polite I was

22:38.766 --> 22:40.644
when I asked for that this morning?

22:40.668 --> 22:44.648
Now I want his whole
damn contract, so sign it.

22:44.672 --> 22:47.517
Sign it! Sign it!

22:49.043 --> 22:50.587
Sign it!

22:50.611 --> 22:52.289
Come on, Samson!

22:52.313 --> 22:56.159
Come on, Samson! Come on, Samson!

22:56.183 --> 22:58.028
Sign it!

23:10.965 --> 23:12.876
Pleasure doing business with you,

23:12.900 --> 23:15.934
Samson. Bitch.

23:25.679 --> 23:27.624
Welcome back, Mr. Cross.
I'll have your bags brought up

23:27.648 --> 23:29.025
to your suites, and just one moment

23:29.049 --> 23:31.061
- for your keys.
- Thank you.

23:31.085 --> 23:34.698
So... I set up the meeting
with Julio Calderon.

23:34.722 --> 23:37.067
Just as a warning... he's old school,

23:37.091 --> 23:39.469
so he expect a woman
to know her place.

23:39.493 --> 23:41.471
You see, I thought you were tripping

23:41.495 --> 23:43.006
when you said we never met, but

23:43.030 --> 23:45.008
it's clear, because you know

23:45.032 --> 23:46.843
Cookie doesn't play
by any man's rules.

23:46.867 --> 23:49.379
It's cute when you do that.

23:49.403 --> 23:51.737
- Do what?
- Pretend like you don't care.

23:54.742 --> 23:56.887
The Moët.

23:56.911 --> 23:58.722
I knew I wasn't crazy.

23:58.746 --> 24:01.024
Here are your keys, Mr. Cross.

24:01.048 --> 24:02.726
Thank you.

24:02.750 --> 24:04.828
Yeah. I'll always be grateful
for what you did for me

24:04.852 --> 24:06.429
- in that elevator.
- Mm-hmm.

24:06.453 --> 24:07.998
And that's the reason
why I'm helping you.

24:08.022 --> 24:10.033
Well, why... why were you pretending

24:10.057 --> 24:11.735
like you didn't recognize me?

24:11.759 --> 24:14.104
Well, I mean, if I admitted my truth,

24:14.128 --> 24:16.339
you think Lucious would have
allowed you to come?

24:16.363 --> 24:18.441
Allowed?

24:18.465 --> 24:20.210
I don't need my man's permission.

24:20.234 --> 24:22.779
We are here for one thing
and one thing only,

24:22.803 --> 24:24.581
and that's to get Empire's money back.

24:32.623 --> 24:35.145
LFM and Empire have merged,
so I don't understand

24:35.146 --> 24:36.924
why we're not
expanding beyond artists.

24:36.948 --> 24:39.760
We could be signing dancers
and models, even influencers.

24:39.784 --> 24:42.229
- That is a great idea.
- Thank you.

24:42.253 --> 24:45.299
For another day.
Right now, our main focus is

24:45.323 --> 24:47.835
on new sounds and musicians,
not no dancers.

24:47.859 --> 24:50.070
- Okay, so why take Blake off the list?
- T.M. Easy, Girl!

24:50.094 --> 24:52.423
That is none of your business.

24:52.424 --> 24:54.302
I'm just saying,
he's undeniably a draw.

24:54.326 --> 24:56.304
Listen, Blake plus Hakeem
plus Tiana...

24:56.328 --> 24:58.128
that is a bomb
I'm not trying to detonate.

25:01.166 --> 25:04.367
Sorry, I... I-I didn't know.

25:06.772 --> 25:09.117
Look, I get it, okay?

25:09.141 --> 25:11.286
I was you once,
with much better style.

25:11.310 --> 25:12.787
Hmm, 'cause that sweater

25:12.811 --> 25:14.789
- got to go.
- Okay.

25:14.813 --> 25:16.825
It take a minute
to pay your dues, okay?

25:16.849 --> 25:19.828
You just got to know your place
and stop overstepping.

25:19.852 --> 25:22.664
It's funny that you have that
logic of knowing your place,

25:22.688 --> 25:24.733
'cause that hasn't really
helped you around here.

25:24.757 --> 25:26.501
I'm just saying.

25:26.525 --> 25:27.969
I didn't hear your name called

26:42.568 --> 26:44.879

26:44.903 --> 26:46.481
you can come up riding on my coattail,

bring Empire back to life,

26:51.910 --> 26:54.756
like a real vocalist should, baby.

26:54.780 --> 26:56.048
I know you don't know
anything about that...

26:56.072 --> 26:57.114
Okay. Your voice

- Get your own songs, boo.
- Get to your seat.

27:14.933 --> 27:17.345
- Meet me inside.
- What about your own songs, boo?

27:17.369 --> 27:20.248
Hey, hey, hey.
Why don't you go to your seat?

27:20.272 --> 27:22.083
Okay. Huh?

27:22.107 --> 27:23.618
What do you do? What do you do?
What do you do?

27:23.642 --> 27:25.453

a kingdom without a king is the same.

27:41.059 --> 27:42.871
I mean, Empire was always number one

27:42.895 --> 27:44.572
when I was at the helm, you know?

27:44.596 --> 27:46.107
Well, how's it feel to know

27:46.131 --> 27:48.243
that the king's own prince
is responsible

27:48.267 --> 27:49.711
for the company's troubles?

27:49.735 --> 27:51.279
Um, excuse me?

27:51.303 --> 27:53.481
Former Empire CEO Jeff Kingsley.

27:53.505 --> 27:55.917
He's your son, correct?

27:55.941 --> 27:57.986
Hey, sorry to bother you guys.
Lucious, we got to talk.

27:58.010 --> 28:00.455
Uh, I'm sorry
we got to wrap this up, brother.

28:00.479 --> 28:02.090
What's up, man?

28:02.114 --> 28:03.825
That, uh, matter from earlier.

28:03.849 --> 28:05.126
I thought you bought me time.

28:05.150 --> 28:06.961
Time ran out.
You got to take care of it now.

28:06.985 --> 28:09.230
Oh. Hey, somebody take this.

28:09.254 --> 28:11.855
Get him out now.

28:13.258 --> 28:15.136
So sorry it's come to this,

28:15.160 --> 28:17.739
but she requires double the
staff to manage her tantrums,

28:17.763 --> 28:19.607
and your balance is overdue
several months.

28:19.631 --> 28:22.844
Yeah, well, this should more
than cover what we owe

28:22.868 --> 28:25.135
and take care of the next six months.

28:26.138 --> 28:28.483
I'll be dead

28:28.507 --> 28:31.741
before I step foot
in that double-trash room!

28:35.214 --> 28:37.147
Dwight?

28:41.843 --> 28:44.610
Get your crusty hands off my things!

28:46.190 --> 28:47.330
- Give us a minute.
- 'Kay.

28:49.259 --> 28:52.372
You gonna burn in hell for
letting me rot in this rathole.

28:52.396 --> 28:54.541
You know I don't deserve to be here.

28:54.565 --> 28:56.743
Look, Ma, you need the kind of help

28:56.767 --> 28:58.511
that I can't give you right now.

28:58.535 --> 29:00.513
You're rotten to the core.

29:00.537 --> 29:03.716
Just like your father
and your bastard son.

29:03.740 --> 29:06.186
How do you even know about Jeffrey?

29:06.210 --> 29:10.023
Your demon spawn came to see me.

29:10.047 --> 29:14.427
You and me finally have
something in common...

29:14.451 --> 29:16.463
knowing what it feels like

29:16.487 --> 29:20.789
to wish your child
never breathed its first breath.

29:24.962 --> 29:29.409
What did little chocolate chip
say when you told her?

29:29.433 --> 29:31.411
How long did it take her

29:31.435 --> 29:35.648
to march her sassy ass
out the front door?

29:35.672 --> 29:37.417
Cookie didn't leave me.

29:37.441 --> 29:39.419
She will.

29:39.443 --> 29:43.923
Soon as she realizes that
no matter how much you promise

29:43.947 --> 29:46.548
to be a good little boy...

29:48.318 --> 29:50.885
...you'll never change.

29:53.657 --> 29:55.902
I know my whole life I've...

29:55.926 --> 29:57.971
spent it...

29:57.995 --> 30:00.028
hurting people.

30:01.498 --> 30:03.776
But it was because
I didn't get the love

30:03.800 --> 30:05.645
that I needed from my mother.

30:05.669 --> 30:08.737
So, if I'm a monster...

30:10.107 --> 30:12.140
...it's because you made me that way.

30:14.645 --> 30:17.257
That evil...

30:17.281 --> 30:20.715
has always been in you.

30:22.886 --> 30:25.053
It ain't going nowhere.

30:28.859 --> 30:30.892
Neither are you.

30:46.009 --> 30:48.721
Look, I'm sorry about that mess

30:48.745 --> 30:49.989
that Treasure started
on the red carpet.

30:50.013 --> 30:51.446
Sit.

30:53.250 --> 30:55.828
But I'm letting it go.

30:55.852 --> 30:59.632
I got to focus on this hit that
me and Jamal are about to make.

30:59.656 --> 31:02.735
She want to focus now.

31:02.759 --> 31:05.238
It don't work that way, does it, G?

31:05.262 --> 31:06.806
It never really does, does it, B?

31:06.830 --> 31:08.474
- Never.
- Never.

31:08.498 --> 31:10.810
Hey, guys.

31:10.834 --> 31:12.312
No.

31:12.336 --> 31:13.880
What is Mama Tee doing here?

31:13.904 --> 31:16.416
- What are you doing here?
- Okay. Sit down.

31:18.008 --> 31:21.854
Look, $100,000.

31:21.878 --> 31:24.424
That's how much it's going to cost

31:24.448 --> 31:27.727
to find and gather
all the photos of you two

31:27.751 --> 31:30.196
wannabe divas ready to throw blows.

31:30.220 --> 31:33.232
Do you think Empire has the time
for this right now?

31:33.256 --> 31:34.867
'Cause we don't. We really don't.

31:34.891 --> 31:37.203
Okay? And Jamal has a very

31:37.227 --> 31:38.771
specific vision for Empire's music.

31:38.795 --> 31:40.273
And y'all better thank
y'all lucky stars

31:40.297 --> 31:42.342
that he still wants you
to be involved, okay?

31:42.366 --> 31:45.244
Which is why he is willing
to work with both of you.

31:45.268 --> 31:46.879
Both of who? I'm-I'm not

31:46.903 --> 31:48.181
- working with her.
- Oh, you don't have to.

31:48.205 --> 31:49.716
Jamal, what the hell is going on?

31:49.740 --> 31:52.885
It looks like
you're being replaced, Mama.

31:52.909 --> 31:54.587
First of all, sweetie, you can

31:54.611 --> 31:56.556
- never replace me. Top shop.
- 'Cause that's what's happening.

31:56.580 --> 31:58.257
- Vintage Dior. Top shop.
- Look... Wow.

31:58.281 --> 31:59.692
Wow!

31:59.716 --> 32:01.794
Now, y'all done?

32:01.818 --> 32:02.895
'Cause I hope you know you ain't

32:02.919 --> 32:04.397
the only ones going through stuff.

32:04.421 --> 32:06.466
But guess what? Seems like I'm here.

32:06.490 --> 32:07.867
Seems like I'm acting
like a professional,

32:07.891 --> 32:09.268
and I'm ready to get the job done.

32:09.292 --> 32:10.737
So if you and you, Tiana,

32:10.761 --> 32:12.472
are not willing to do the same,
y'all can

32:12.496 --> 32:14.696
dance your happy asses
up outside the studio.

32:16.133 --> 32:18.444
Hmm? Okay.

32:18.468 --> 32:20.913
Now,

32:20.937 --> 32:25.251
I am taking my vocal off of
the song, and you two are gonna

32:25.275 --> 32:26.653
- record it together.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

32:26.677 --> 32:28.121
- Tee, listen to me.
- Jamal, no.

32:28.145 --> 32:29.522
- That's not gonna work here.
- Listen. Listen. Excuse me.

32:29.546 --> 32:31.924
Tee, you've never done a song
with a strong female.

32:31.948 --> 32:34.293
- Thank you.
- And, Treasure,

32:34.317 --> 32:36.663
you've barely ever done a song,
so you could definitely use

32:36.687 --> 32:38.965
the cosign from Empire's princess.

32:38.989 --> 32:40.600
Huh. You're welcome.

32:40.624 --> 32:41.634
Look,

32:41.658 --> 32:43.302
any more issues,
and neither one of you

32:43.326 --> 32:44.570
are gonna be working with Jamal.

32:44.594 --> 32:45.772
You got it?

32:45.796 --> 32:47.173
Are we clear?

32:47.197 --> 32:48.641
'Cause you better get clear.

32:48.665 --> 32:49.798
Quickly.

32:54.271 --> 32:55.682
We're clear.

32:55.706 --> 32:58.184
Now, get y'all mean asses out of here.

32:58.208 --> 33:00.787
Yo, Dre.

33:00.811 --> 33:02.689
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Of course.

33:02.713 --> 33:05.158
Tell me you heard.

33:05.182 --> 33:06.959
They let me out of my contract, man.

33:06.983 --> 33:09.028
Yes. I know we didn't ask
for that, but...

33:09.052 --> 33:11.130
I'm here, man. I'm a free man.

33:11.154 --> 33:12.699
Yeah. Sometimes people do
the right thing

33:12.723 --> 33:14.500
out of the goodness
of their hearts, huh?

33:14.524 --> 33:16.002
My guy.

33:16.026 --> 33:17.437
- My man.
- Appreciate it, man.

33:17.461 --> 33:18.938
- Welcome to Empire.
- Yes, sir.

33:18.962 --> 33:20.829
- All right.
- Let's get it.

33:36.179 --> 33:37.457
She's here. She's here.

33:37.481 --> 33:39.292
Oh, my God, you look so beautiful.

33:39.316 --> 33:40.960
It's unbelievable. Look how you look.

33:40.984 --> 33:43.563
Oh, I hope I didn't keep
you gentlemen waiting too long.

33:43.587 --> 33:45.965
A star has fallen from the heavens.

33:45.989 --> 33:48.167
Handsome and charming.

33:48.191 --> 33:49.802
- Thank you.
- Of course, of course.

33:49.826 --> 33:51.571
A round of Seco.

33:51.595 --> 33:52.705
Allergic to anything, Cookie?

33:52.729 --> 33:54.140
Fake Chanel.

33:54.164 --> 33:55.675
Why do people do that?

34:16.953 --> 34:18.397
I'm sorry, I don't speak

34:18.420 --> 34:20.565
your beautiful language,
but, uh, it appears

34:20.590 --> 34:23.536
that negotiations with you two
are going south.

34:23.560 --> 34:25.036
Beautiful and astute.

34:25.061 --> 34:27.706
Well, may I sweeten the deal...

34:27.731 --> 34:30.176
with something that only I can offer?

34:30.199 --> 34:32.445
- By all means.
- I'm sure your clients

34:32.469 --> 34:36.047
would enjoy a private concert
with my Empire artists.

34:36.072 --> 34:37.784
Gratis, of course.

34:37.808 --> 34:40.119
The Saudis paid millions
for the privilege.

34:40.143 --> 34:42.021
This is true, but...

34:42.045 --> 34:43.790
No buts, Julio.

34:43.813 --> 34:46.391
That bastard Eddie Barker
embezzled Empire money,

34:46.416 --> 34:48.516
money I need to save my company.

34:50.320 --> 34:52.598
Look, I'm willing
to give you ten percent

34:52.621 --> 34:54.266
of what's in the account.

34:54.291 --> 34:55.802
25% of what's in the account.

34:55.826 --> 34:57.937
You are insulting the lady, Julio.

34:57.961 --> 34:59.472
- Let's go.
- No.

34:59.496 --> 35:01.156
I'm not going anywhere
without my money.

35:03.166 --> 35:06.579
So, unless you plan on room-
and-boarding me, Mr. Calderon...

35:06.603 --> 35:08.614
Or lose a significant portion

35:08.638 --> 35:10.149
of your clientele.

35:10.173 --> 35:12.552
You would end our lucrative
relationship over this woman?

35:12.576 --> 35:14.253
That's Cookie Lyon.

35:14.277 --> 35:15.843
She's worth it.

35:19.683 --> 35:22.850
- Salud.
- Salud.

35:29.192 --> 35:31.571

Oh, no, no, no, no, these feet
aren't celebrating anything.

37:17.200 --> 37:18.778
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes. We did that.

37:18.802 --> 37:21.213
- Okay, we did do that.
- Let's go.

37:24.207 --> 37:25.751

37:25.775 --> 37:27.286

37:27.310 --> 37:29.555

Got you.

I should go.

37:45.929 --> 37:47.473
But we're just getting started.

37:47.497 --> 37:49.575
Do I need to remind you
that I'm married?

37:49.599 --> 37:52.545
I'm well aware of that.
But do you want to be?

37:52.569 --> 37:54.447

37:54.471 --> 37:56.248
It's a simple question,
an honest question.

37:56.272 --> 37:58.784
I ain't never lied to my woman,
I never will.

37:58.808 --> 38:01.954
Is that so, mister?
I don't believe we've ever met.

38:01.978 --> 38:03.089
Yeah, but you ain't my woman yet.

38:03.113 --> 38:05.324
Yet? You're delusional.

Let's talk about Damon Cross.

40:09.200 --> 40:10.510
Damon who?

40:10.534 --> 40:12.012
Well, now you're boring me, Thurston.

40:12.036 --> 40:13.814
I was told you were clever.

Okay, look, you're
wasting your time, Miss.

40:22.880 --> 40:24.097
You can call me Meghan.

40:25.750 --> 40:27.861
Now, you're either gonna tell me
what I want to know

40:27.885 --> 40:29.496
about Damon Cross,
or we're gonna talk about

40:29.520 --> 40:32.221
your other buddy, Lucious Lyon.
Remember him?

40:35.326 --> 40:38.071
Meghan, you know what I do remember?

40:38.095 --> 40:39.762
Something called attorney-client
privilege.

40:39.763 --> 40:41.274
That's what I remember.

40:41.298 --> 40:43.410
I thought they would have
taught you the exception

40:43.434 --> 40:46.168
to that rule at
University of Guam Law.

40:46.651 --> 40:48.502
Here's the billion-dollar question.

40:48.503 --> 40:50.781
Lucious Lyon or Damon Cross:

40:50.805 --> 40:52.939
whose freedom are you gonna
trade for your own?

41:29.844 --> 41:31.455
Lucious, what are you doing here?

41:31.479 --> 41:34.658
I just wanted to make sure
you was all right, baby.

41:34.682 --> 41:36.927
I'm fine, I'm fine, okay? We're fine.

41:36.951 --> 41:40.598
We got the money, it's gonna be
wired into our account tomorrow.

41:40.622 --> 41:43.601
Great. Then let's turn
this little visit

41:43.625 --> 41:45.469
- into a celebration.
- No, no, no, no.

41:45.493 --> 41:47.171
What about your interviews?

41:47.195 --> 41:51.008
Look, I want to

break the bank or nothing.

42:06.347 --> 42:08.826
Look, my plan is to turn it into

42:08.850 --> 42:10.728
a little rehab center.

42:10.752 --> 42:15.533
You know, for teens
and for young boys who...

42:15.557 --> 42:17.368
whose mothers don't know
how to teach 'em

42:17.392 --> 42:19.170
how to be good people.

42:19.194 --> 42:21.071
What's wrong, Lucious?

42:21.095 --> 42:23.207
I'm sorry.

42:23.231 --> 42:25.009
For what?

42:25.033 --> 42:27.211
The other day,
when you were all over me,

42:27.235 --> 42:29.313
you know, about change.

42:29.337 --> 42:31.081
I got defensive.

42:31.105 --> 42:34.018
I took it like you was attacking
everything we built together.

42:34.042 --> 42:36.053
I didn't mean it like that.

42:36.077 --> 42:37.822
I know, I know, I know.

42:37.846 --> 42:41.392
When you say you want to make right

42:41.416 --> 42:44.061
the things we did wrong,

42:44.085 --> 42:46.697
I think that's the way
for us to rebuild

42:46.721 --> 42:48.499
and retell our story together.
