all that today, Lawrence,

03:21.200 --> 03:23.035
but--
- Tomorrow?

03:23.037 --> 03:24.674
- This assignment was to
do a two-minute video essay

03:24.676 --> 03:27.138
on bias in the media, right?

03:27.140 --> 03:30.482
So, what is this?

03:30.484 --> 03:32.451
- Oh yeah, well, I just decided

03:32.453 --> 03:34.178
that I didn't really
care about that topic

03:34.180 --> 03:36.752
and wanted to do
something more personal,

03:36.754 --> 03:38.248
from the heart.

03:38.250 --> 03:39.392

Yes, Lauren.

03:42.364 --> 03:43.462

03:43.464 --> 03:45.398
It was really cute.

03:45.400 --> 03:46.861
- Okay.

03:46.863 --> 03:48.401
Well, it's not
supposed to be cute.

03:48.403 --> 03:49.996
- There was a skit
at the beginning

03:49.998 --> 03:51.404
and then it turns into
a mockumentary, right?

03:51.406 --> 03:53.406
- No, the beginning is an homage

03:53.408 --> 03:55.573
to Charles Dickens'
"A Christmas Carol."

03:57.236 --> 04:01.777
If anything, I would say that
Reject's Night is simply a,

04:02.747 --> 04:04.384
a love letter to friendship.

04:05.420 --> 04:06.243
- Okay.

04:06.245 --> 04:08.278
Well, all right.

04:08.280 --> 04:09.818
Matt, anything to add?

04:09.820 --> 04:11.457
- Yeah, it's just
a private joke.

04:11.459 --> 04:12.623
- What?

04:12.625 --> 04:13.459
It's not a private joke.

04:13.461 --> 04:14.493
Come on!

04:15.628 --> 04:16.462
Okay.

04:16.464 --> 04:17.958
- You can sit.

04:17.960 --> 04:19.157
- I'm going to
address the class.

04:20.567 --> 04:23.370
Me and Matt watch SNL
every weekend, right?

04:23.372 --> 04:25.295
And so I guess the joke is

04:25.297 --> 04:28.441
while your typical
teenager is out having sex

04:28.443 --> 04:31.906

of Reject's Night.

04:38.145 --> 04:39.980
I just,

04:39.982 --> 04:41.619
I just think that you should
make films about things

04:41.621 --> 04:43.148
that matter to you.

04:43.150 --> 04:44.754
I'm sorry.

04:44.756 --> 04:45.755
I don't care about
bias in the media

04:45.757 --> 04:47.460
and probably never will,

04:47.462 --> 04:50.826
so yeah.

04:50.828 --> 04:53.367

05:08.307 --> 05:09.581

- Good.

05:09.583 --> 05:11.451
- Good, good!

05:11.453 --> 05:13.145
Does that mean we're gonna
see a cut anytime soon?

05:13.147 --> 05:14.982
Because you know,

05:14.984 --> 05:16.588
the principal still needs
to approve the concept

05:16.590 --> 05:18.183
before we screen it at
the year end assembly.

05:19.527 --> 05:20.988
- Yeah, it's just
like, you know,

05:20.990 --> 05:22.627
with how my creative
process works,

05:22.629 --> 05:23.859
kind of like, you
know, I just really--

05:23.861 --> 05:25.795
- Okay, Lawrence,

05:25.797 --> 05:29.293
directing the year end video
is a huge honour, okay?

05:29.295 --> 05:30.800
So if you're not gonna
take it seriously

05:30.802 --> 05:32.670

05:32.672 --> 05:34.969
then I'm sure plenty of
other students will, okay?

They're probably gonna go to

08:17.133 --> 08:19.001
They're idiots! Take tourism
and business management.

08:19.003 --> 08:20.497

talking about American tuition.

have like 90,000 US?

some of my things,

08:36.185 --> 08:37.184
but not everything.

08:37.186 --> 08:38.416

08:38.418 --> 08:40.594
Our lives are equally hard.

around a video store.

08:47.493 --> 08:49.031

08:54.368 --> 08:55.532
Don't slam that door.

08:56.436 --> 09:00.537
(door slamming)
(sighing)

09:00.539 --> 09:05.652
(upbeat rock music)
(people chattering)

09:21.032 --> 09:22.031
- Welcome to Sequels.

09:22.033 --> 09:23.527
Oh, hey Lawrence.

09:23.529 --> 09:24.737
- Yeah, yeah.

09:28.105 --> 09:30.468
- Ah, that is a great choice.

09:30.470 --> 09:31.568
Love to see it.

09:33.748 --> 09:34.714
Hey, man.

09:39.919 --> 09:42.722
- I've seen it babe.
- Okay, this one?

09:42.724 --> 09:44.757
- I don't wanna
watch an old movie.

09:44.759 --> 09:45.758
- Fine, Mario.

09:45.760 --> 09:46.726
This one.

09:48.290 --> 09:50.125
- Babe, I hate this guy.

09:50.127 --> 09:51.621
He always looks like he has
to take the hugest shit.

09:51.623 --> 09:53.227
- Hey.

09:53.229 --> 09:54.734
- [Customer] Why don't
you ever let me pick?

09:54.736 --> 09:56.395
- You guys finding
everything okay today?

09:56.397 --> 09:57.462
- Do you work here?

09:58.267 --> 09:59.233
- No.

10:00.170 --> 10:01.400
- What should we get, man?

10:01.402 --> 10:03.006
- Are you looking for a comedy?

10:05.010 --> 10:06.878
Oh.

10:06.880 --> 10:08.638
Ooh, have you ever seen
"Happiness" by Todd Solondz?

10:08.640 --> 10:09.815
- No.
- No.

10:09.817 --> 10:11.278
- It's this really amazing movie

10:11.280 --> 10:12.642
about all these
people living in L.A.

10:12.644 --> 10:15.579
who are like, super messed up.

10:15.581 --> 10:16.756
There's a dad in the movie

10:16.758 --> 10:18.318
who's like an actual pedophile

10:18.320 --> 10:19.693
who wants to have
sex with his son.

10:19.695 --> 10:21.618
And Philip Seymour Hoffman's

10:21.620 --> 10:23.389
always calling people on the
phone while he masturbates.

10:23.391 --> 10:25.798
But it's also really hopeful.

10:25.800 --> 10:27.624
Like, you really care
about all these characters,

10:27.626 --> 10:29.736
which I think makes
it so much worse.

10:31.300 --> 10:32.464
You know what?

10:32.466 --> 10:33.839
It speaks for itself.

10:33.841 --> 10:35.434
Enrich your child.

10:35.436 --> 10:36.633
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

10:36.635 --> 10:40.109
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

10:42.278 --> 10:44.245
- [Shannon] I can take
the next customer.

10:46.678 --> 10:48.150
- How many movies
do you have there?

10:48.152 --> 10:49.382
- [Lawrence] Like, seven.

10:49.384 --> 10:50.955
- No, you pick one.

10:50.957 --> 10:51.791
- One.

10:51.793 --> 10:53.155
Are you serious?

10:53.157 --> 10:54.794
- [Alana] I can help who's next.
- One.

10:56.424 --> 10:57.962
- [Sequels commercial] When you
rent any three new releases,

10:57.964 --> 10:58.963
you'll get a classic
movie at half price--

10:58.965 --> 11:00.690
(movies clattering)

11:00.692 --> 11:02.263
- [Alana] Hey, Lawrence.

11:02.265 --> 11:03.869
Find everything okay?

11:03.871 --> 11:04.837
- Yep.

11:05.873 --> 11:07.807
Look, I know that last time,

11:07.809 --> 11:09.776
you guys said you
weren't hiring,

11:09.778 --> 11:13.241
but I just wanted to give
you a hard copy of my resume.

11:13.243 --> 11:16.145
- Oh yeah, thanks.

11:16.147 --> 11:17.509
I'll hold on to that.

11:18.853 --> 11:21.711
- I don't know if you
know, but Lawrence,

11:21.713 --> 11:23.383
he applied to NYU's

11:23.385 --> 11:25.484
Tisch School of the Arts.
- Tisch, yeah.

11:25.486 --> 11:26.925
- He's very talented.

11:26.927 --> 11:27.827
Loves films.

11:27.829 --> 11:29.554
- Very cool.

11:29.556 --> 11:31.424
Yeah, Terri,

11:31.426 --> 11:34.526
it looks like you have a late
fee on your account for $25

11:34.528 --> 11:36.902
for "Wild Things."

11:36.904 --> 11:38.904
Would you like to
pay that off today?

11:39.698 --> 11:41.269
- No, I would not.

11:41.271 --> 11:44.338
("Is This Thing On?"
by Reversing Falls)

11:46.276 --> 11:48.144
- Yo, this is fucked.

11:48.146 --> 11:50.476
Why don't you tell your
mom you need your own room?

11:50.478 --> 11:52.049
- It's fine.

11:52.051 --> 11:54.216
It's just 'cause all my
dad's stuff is in there.

11:55.021 --> 11:56.251
We switch every month.

11:56.253 --> 11:58.088
I'll have my own
room in January.

11:59.058 --> 12:00.420
Can you pass me the cushions?

12:04.426 --> 12:05.392
Bam.

12:08.232 --> 12:09.198
Ow.

12:11.268 --> 12:13.565

12:13.567 --> 12:16.403

12:30.584 --> 12:31.583
SNL begins with
"The Chanukkah Song"

12:31.585 --> 12:32.584
- Is that Adam Sandler?

12:32.586 --> 12:33.860
- Mom.
- What?

12:33.862 --> 12:34.993
Can I ask a question?

12:38.130 --> 12:39.492
He has a new movie coming out?

12:39.494 --> 12:41.098
- Yes, "Punch Drunk Love."

12:41.100 --> 12:43.694
Remember, you were
supposed to take me.

12:43.696 --> 12:45.267
- Dude, it's the
"Chanukah Song."

12:45.269 --> 12:46.235
- What?

12:51.572 --> 12:52.736
- Maybe you should
tell Adam Sandler

12:52.738 --> 12:54.672
that we celebrate Chanukah.

12:54.674 --> 12:56.443
- Mom!

12:56.445 --> 12:58.082
Me and Matt can't have
Reject's Night with you here.

12:58.084 --> 12:59.512
- Well, I'm sorry,
but I live here.

12:59.514 --> 13:00.986
- Yeah, but like,

13:00.988 --> 13:02.614
we can't be truest
selves with you around.

13:02.616 --> 13:03.780
- This is a really small house.

13:03.782 --> 13:04.616
Where would you like me to go?

13:04.618 --> 13:05.452
- To your room.

13:05.454 --> 13:07.058
- To my room?

13:07.060 --> 13:08.026
How about you go to
your room, Lawrence?

13:08.028 --> 13:09.027
- I'm in my room!

13:09.029 --> 13:10.963
My room is the couch!

13:10.965 --> 13:12.129
- Well, you know, I'm sorry
you can't do Reject's Night

13:12.131 --> 13:13.966
in a big fancy house tonight.

13:13.968 --> 13:15.495
- Mom, I'm just trying to
watch SNL with my best friend.

13:15.497 --> 13:17.233
And now, we're missing
"The Chanukah Song"

13:17.235 --> 13:18.696
with a special guest
appearance from Rob Schneider,

13:18.698 --> 13:21.237
which I'll probably
never get to see again.

13:21.239 --> 13:22.942
Can you please just go?

13:22.944 --> 13:24.339
God.

13:27.443 --> 13:28.805
- How do you stand him, Matt?

13:31.084 --> 13:31.984
Let's go.

13:36.584 --> 13:38.892
(Lawrence laughing)

13:38.894 --> 13:40.927
- Dude, that was fucking brutal.

13:40.929 --> 13:42.489
- Yeah.

13:42.491 --> 13:44.260
She gets like, really
weird on the weekends.

13:44.262 --> 13:45.195
I don't know.

13:46.528 --> 13:47.527
(whispering) Menopause.

13:47.529 --> 13:48.968
SNL Main Credits begin

13:48.970 --> 13:49.969
- Oh, Jimmy Fallon.

13:49.971 --> 13:51.135
Not funny at all.

13:51.137 --> 13:52.631
- He breaks in every sketch.

13:52.633 --> 13:54.831
Ruined the "Weekend Update."

13:54.833 --> 13:55.799
I miss Norm.

13:57.011 --> 13:58.835
- Yo, do you wanna do the thing?

13:58.837 --> 13:59.803
- Yeah?

14:01.510 --> 14:03.312
All right, what
are you gonna do?

14:03.314 --> 14:05.281
I'm gonna watch a break
dancer in Times Square, okay?

14:05.283 --> 14:07.085
What about you?

14:07.087 --> 14:09.714
- Okay, I'm in an oyster
bar in Grand Central Station

14:09.716 --> 14:11.089
and I'm laughing
with all my friends,

14:11.091 --> 14:12.189
having a great time.

14:12.191 --> 14:14.785
- Okay.
- Okay.

14:14.787 --> 14:19.064
(imitating announcer) It's
"Saturday Night Live" with
your host, Matt Macarchuck!

14:21.761 --> 14:23.035
Yeah, oh.

14:24.335 --> 14:26.500
- Keep the change, man.

14:26.502 --> 14:28.040
And Lawrence Kweller.

14:28.042 --> 14:28.975
- Oh, you guys.

14:28.977 --> 14:29.866
Oh, I couldn't.

14:29.868 --> 14:33.045
Oh. (slurping)

14:33.047 --> 14:34.508
Ooh, that's good.

14:34.510 --> 14:36.015
- And your hosts,

14:36.017 --> 14:38.380
Lawrence Kweller
and Matt Macarchuck.

14:38.382 --> 14:40.250
- (laughing) Okay.

14:40.252 --> 14:42.582
Hey guys, we have a great
show for you tonight.

14:42.584 --> 14:43.649
- Korn is here.

14:43.651 --> 14:45.222
- Korn is here, yeah.

14:45.224 --> 14:46.586
So make sure to stick around.

14:46.588 --> 14:48.390
- Because we'll be.

14:48.392 --> 14:50.425
- We'll be right back.
- We'll be right back.

14:50.427 --> 14:51.998
(microwave beeping)

14:52.000 --> 14:54.066
- Sorry, I didn't have
time to eat my lunch

14:54.068 --> 14:55.463
so I'm just gonna,

14:55.465 --> 14:57.894
but it won't
distract from your--

14:57.896 --> 15:00.270
- Of course, that's fine.
- Interview at all.

15:00.272 --> 15:02.932
And thanks for coming
in on such short notice.

15:02.934 --> 15:03.944
Someone just quit.

15:06.608 --> 15:07.607
Okay.

15:07.609 --> 15:08.443
That's fine.

15:08.445 --> 15:10.313
Lawrence,

15:10.315 --> 15:12.183
why don't you just tell me
a little bit about yourself?

15:12.185 --> 15:16.715
- So basically, like,
movies are my entire life.

15:18.290 --> 15:19.817
I need to watch movies
like I need to breathe air.

15:19.819 --> 15:22.292
And if I don't watch
movie every single day,

15:22.294 --> 15:26.263
I feel like there's a part
of myself that's like, dying.

15:26.265 --> 15:28.133
- [Alana] Oh.

15:28.135 --> 15:29.299
- So I think that could
make me a really big asset

15:29.301 --> 15:31.895
to the Sequels corporation.

15:31.897 --> 15:33.402
- Great.

15:33.404 --> 15:34.898
So what's your
availability like?

15:34.900 --> 15:36.438
Like, can you work
evenings and weekends?

15:36.440 --> 15:37.967
- Oh, extremely available.
- Okay.

15:37.969 --> 15:39.144
- Like, I go to high
school during the day.

15:39.146 --> 15:40.970
- What high school do you go to?

15:40.972 --> 15:42.543
- A-shot, Aldershot High.

15:42.545 --> 15:44.446
- (gasping) No way.

15:44.448 --> 15:46.448
I went to Aldershot.

15:46.450 --> 15:47.515
- (laughing) Really?

15:47.517 --> 15:48.483
- Yeah.

15:50.091 --> 15:50.947
Okay.

15:50.949 --> 15:52.850
- Yeah.

15:52.852 --> 15:55.325
You know, I really appreciate
the opportunity to interview.

15:55.327 --> 15:57.360
- Well, like to be
honest with you,

15:57.362 --> 15:59.197
like if you work here,

15:59.199 --> 16:00.726
you have to know how to leave
your problems at the door.

16:00.728 --> 16:02.266
- Oh, of course.

16:02.268 --> 16:03.432
- Like, you have
to be professional

16:03.434 --> 16:04.598
even when you don't wanna be.

16:04.600 --> 16:06.072
- Could I actually tell you

16:06.074 --> 16:07.304
a little like
anecdote about that?

16:07.306 --> 16:08.866
- Yeah, sure.

16:08.868 --> 16:11.000
- This might surprise
you, given my resume,

16:11.002 --> 16:12.639
but I was actually doing really,

16:12.641 --> 16:14.641
really poorly in
school last year.

16:14.643 --> 16:17.347
I just, I just wanted
to sleep all day.

16:17.349 --> 16:19.184
I never wanted to go to class

16:19.186 --> 16:21.483
and my mom was really upset
because I wasn't talking to her.

16:21.485 --> 16:23.188
She kept trying to make me

16:23.190 --> 16:25.157
go on all these different
anti-depressants

16:25.159 --> 16:26.851
because I have "serious
emotional problems"
or whatever, but.

16:26.853 --> 16:28.688
- Oh, yeah, that--

16:28.690 --> 16:31.658
- Anyway, it was Awards
Night at Aldershot

16:31.660 --> 16:33.759
and everyone was
getting up onstage

16:33.761 --> 16:36.234
to get their plaque for
being on the honour roll.

16:37.534 --> 16:38.962
And I was filming.

16:38.964 --> 16:41.470
I just had this
thought, which was like,

16:41.472 --> 16:44.374
you know, what if I'm smart?

16:44.376 --> 16:45.870
I bet if I actually did my work

16:45.872 --> 16:47.410
and handed my
assignments in on time

16:47.412 --> 16:49.280
that I could be on the
stupid honour roll too.

16:49.282 --> 16:50.281
- Mm-hmm.

16:50.283 --> 16:51.744
- So the next day,

16:51.746 --> 16:53.614
I had my mother
drive me to Chapters

16:53.616 --> 16:56.045
and I speed read "Seven Habits
of Highly Effective Teens"

16:56.047 --> 16:59.455
and it totally changed
my life forever.

16:59.457 --> 17:01.358
- Mm.

17:01.360 --> 17:02.359
- And the very next year,
I was on the honour roll.

17:02.361 --> 17:03.888
- Oh, there you go!

17:03.890 --> 17:04.955
- Now, I would say
I'm very good at

17:06.398 --> 17:08.398
putting first things first.
- Mm-hmm.

17:08.400 --> 17:11.533
- And um, beginning
with the end in mind,

17:11.535 --> 17:15.900
which for me is going to NYU
Tisch School for the Arts.

17:15.902 --> 17:17.770
A lot of my favourite
filmmakers went there

17:17.772 --> 17:19.706
and I never really thought
that I was good enough,

17:19.708 --> 17:22.071
but I've decided to bet
on myself as an artist

17:22.073 --> 17:23.182
and a young man.

17:25.120 --> 17:26.317
- Cool.

17:26.319 --> 17:28.077
- So NYU costs 90,000 US dollars

17:28.079 --> 17:30.948
and I know you get 10 free
rentals a week if you work here.

17:30.950 --> 17:33.753
So you don't have to
tell me right now,

17:33.755 --> 17:38.263
but yeah, just know the stakes
are very, very high for me.

17:40.234 --> 17:41.893
- Okay, yeah.

17:43.600 --> 17:44.698
Like, I think

17:48.440 --> 17:50.000
I'm gonna hire you.

17:51.069 --> 17:55.280
Welcome to Sequels, Lawrence!

17:55.282 --> 18:00.417
(train chugging)
(soft contemplative music)

18:01.387 --> 18:04.080
All right, team.

18:04.082 --> 18:05.521
Hands in.
- Yeah.

18:07.085 --> 18:08.755
- Come on.

18:08.757 --> 18:11.197
- Teamwork makes the dream work!

18:11.199 --> 18:12.429
Yeah.

18:12.431 --> 18:13.694
- Very nice.
(applauding)

18:13.696 --> 18:15.091
- Very good.
- All right.

18:15.093 --> 18:16.961
So I have our mystery
shopper report

18:16.963 --> 18:20.536
and Brant Street earned a
98% on customer service.

18:20.538 --> 18:22.065
- Yeah.
- Oh yeah.

18:22.067 --> 18:23.902
- Gift cards for everyone.
- Nice.

18:23.904 --> 18:27.037
- So, I'm gonna ask you guys
to set some goals today.

18:27.039 --> 18:28.874
Shannon?
- Mm-hmm.

18:28.876 --> 18:31.943
- How many Sequels memberships
do you think you can sell?

18:32.946 --> 18:35.045
- Like two.

18:35.047 --> 18:39.291
- Shannon, how about five?

18:40.228 --> 18:41.656
- Okay, yeah.

18:41.658 --> 18:42.591
- Great.
- Yeah, put me down for five.

18:42.593 --> 18:44.120
- Nice.
- Nice.

18:44.122 --> 18:47.794
And how about Brendan,
Mr. GameCube expert?

18:47.796 --> 18:51.963
How many previously enjoyed
games do you think you can sell?

18:51.965 --> 18:53.635
- I am also gonna sell five.

18:53.637 --> 18:54.834
- Great.

18:54.836 --> 18:56.440
And Lawrence.

18:56.442 --> 18:58.002
Now, did everyone get a
chance to meet Lawrence?

18:58.004 --> 19:00.444
Lawrence will be
on the floor today

19:00.446 --> 19:01.445
working his very first
active seller shift.

19:01.447 --> 19:02.215
(Lawrence gulps.)

19:03.812 --> 19:08.947
So how many advanced
copies of "Shrek" on DVD

19:09.917 --> 19:11.422
do you think you can sell?

19:11.424 --> 19:13.226
- Isn't "Shrek"
already out on DVD?

19:13.228 --> 19:14.821
- Yeah, but this is like,

19:14.823 --> 19:17.824
it's a new special
edition with yeah,

19:17.826 --> 19:19.331
it's wide screen

19:19.333 --> 19:20.497
and then there's
like special footage

19:20.499 --> 19:22.367
of how they animated the donkey.

19:22.369 --> 19:23.995
- ("Shrek" impression) Donkey.

19:23.997 --> 19:25.535
- That's awesome.
- Thank you.

19:25.537 --> 19:27.405
- Then probably like zero?

19:28.804 --> 19:31.211
- No, I can put you down
for like three "Shreks."

19:32.379 --> 19:33.774
I can do that.

19:33.776 --> 19:35.644
All right.

19:35.646 --> 19:38.174
Nice, so we're gonna have
a really awesome day, team.

19:38.176 --> 19:39.714
- Okay, I'm sorry, Alana,

19:39.716 --> 19:41.980
can I just say one thing
like, really quickly?

19:41.982 --> 19:45.522
I understand that I'm new
here, but I really hate lying.

19:45.524 --> 19:47.216
There is no way
I'm gonna be able

19:47.218 --> 19:49.086
to sell three copies
of "Shrek" tonight.

19:49.088 --> 19:50.857
Like, I could maybe
see myself doing that

19:50.859 --> 19:52.562
with a film that I cared about.

19:52.564 --> 19:54.960
"Adaptation," "Bowling
for Columbine."

19:54.962 --> 19:57.402
I'm very comfortable promoting
the works of Michael Moore,

19:57.404 --> 19:59.800
but I thought I got hired here
to talk about real cinema,

19:59.802 --> 20:02.539
which "Shrek" is not.

20:02.541 --> 20:04.574
So can I just do that?

20:04.576 --> 20:08.776
And also that sash, is
that gonna be mandatory?

20:08.778 --> 20:10.382
I refuse to wear the sash.

20:10.384 --> 20:12.516
I have to put my foot
down on that as well.

20:14.014 --> 20:17.048
(Lawrence sighing)

20:20.757 --> 20:21.624
God.

20:21.626 --> 20:23.054
Hey.
- Hey.

20:23.056 --> 20:24.990
- You finding everything okay?

20:24.992 --> 20:26.827
- Yeah. Thanks, babe.

20:27.764 --> 20:29.258
- What's that?

20:29.260 --> 20:31.403
"Legally Blonde,"
this is a great movie.

20:31.405 --> 20:32.701
My mom really likes the scene

20:32.703 --> 20:35.935
with the bend and snap.
(snapping)

20:42.977 --> 20:44.174
- I told you,

20:44.176 --> 20:46.242
it's the guy in the TV show

20:46.244 --> 20:50.785
and the woman with the
hair who married that man.

20:50.787 --> 20:52.281
- Yes!

20:52.283 --> 20:53.854
You're describing "The
Whole Nine Yards."

20:53.856 --> 20:57.022
- It is not "The
Whole Nine Yards!"

20:57.024 --> 20:58.892
- No,

20:58.894 --> 21:00.223
we rented out our last copy of
"Blue Crush" this afternoon.

21:00.225 --> 21:01.224
- Could you help me?

21:01.226 --> 21:03.127
- Thanks, bye.

21:03.129 --> 21:06.130
- A little boy was helping
me, but he's disappeared.

21:06.132 --> 21:07.703
- Okay.

21:07.705 --> 21:09.540
Well, do you remember
what he looked like?

21:09.542 --> 21:11.102
- Jewish.

21:11.104 --> 21:12.609
- Sorry, he was Jewish?

21:12.611 --> 21:16.140
- You know, thick
dark hair, brown eyes,

21:16.142 --> 21:19.913
shorter than a man,
like Danny DeVito.

21:19.915 --> 21:21.684
A little Jew boy.

21:21.686 --> 21:22.553
No, hold on.

21:22.555 --> 21:24.390
TV Jewish.

21:24.392 --> 21:28.922
A little boy who could
play a Jew on television.

21:29.892 --> 21:33.366
(Main "I Like Movies" theme)

21:35.260 --> 21:36.435
- [Matt] Come on, man.

21:36.437 --> 21:37.161
We're gonna miss the movie.

21:41.442 --> 21:43.299
What are we going to see again?

21:43.301 --> 21:44.806
- [Lawrence] P-T-A!

21:44.808 --> 21:45.807
- [Employee] And
"The Santa Claus 2"

21:45.809 --> 21:47.303
will be in theater 12.

21:47.305 --> 21:48.711
- Two tickets to Paul
Thomas Anderson's

21:48.713 --> 21:50.383
"Punch Drunk Love" please.

21:51.177 --> 21:52.341
- Okay.

21:52.343 --> 21:53.342
Are you paying in cash or?

21:53.344 --> 21:54.178
- Yeah, cash.

21:54.180 --> 21:55.421
- Oh no, Matt.

21:55.423 --> 21:57.214
I got this.

21:58.316 --> 21:59.821
- You never have money.

21:59.823 --> 22:01.427
- Yeah.

22:01.429 --> 22:02.824
Well, you know, I'm just
happy you came with me.

22:02.826 --> 22:04.023
- Yeah, I love Adam Sandler.

22:04.025 --> 22:05.629
- Well, I mean,

22:05.631 --> 22:07.125
this isn't gonna be your
typical Sandler affair.

22:07.127 --> 22:08.665
It's a Paul Thomas
Anderson film,

22:08.667 --> 22:10.359
so it's gonna be a bit
challenging for you.

22:10.361 --> 22:12.031
- I think I can fucking get it.

22:14.673 --> 22:16.101
- Thank you.
- Okay.

22:16.103 --> 22:17.366
Enjoy your show.

22:17.368 --> 22:18.334
- I will.

22:20.272 --> 22:21.777
- I just realized when
you're in New York,

22:21.779 --> 22:24.010
you can see SNL
like, every weekend.

22:24.012 --> 22:25.715
- I think the
tickets are based on

22:25.717 --> 22:27.420
like a highly competitive
lottery system,

22:27.422 --> 22:28.685
so yeah.

22:31.019 --> 22:32.590
- Can I go with you?

22:32.592 --> 22:34.790
- I mean, if you can get
tickets, yeah, for sure.

22:34.792 --> 22:37.023
- No, like to New York.

22:37.025 --> 22:38.563
We could move there together

22:38.565 --> 22:39.828
'cause I have dual
citizenship, so.

22:41.469 --> 22:43.964
- Hey, do you guys do little
shots of espresso here?

22:45.539 --> 22:47.099
Okay.

22:47.101 --> 22:49.541
Then I will get a
root beer, medium.

22:49.543 --> 22:51.037
Matt, do you want anything?

22:52.337 --> 22:54.579
- Yeah, just a popcorn
and a Coke please.

22:54.581 --> 22:57.681
- Okay, so yeah, two drinks
and two popcorns please.

22:57.683 --> 22:59.144
So I just wanted to talk to you

22:59.146 --> 23:01.377
about Reject's
Night this weekend.

23:01.379 --> 23:04.050
I think there might be
a potential conflict.

23:04.052 --> 23:06.052
- What's the conflict,
that you're gay?

23:06.054 --> 23:08.890
- No, it's that I got
a job at Sequels, man!

23:08.892 --> 23:10.694
It's the best thing that's
ever happened to me.

23:10.696 --> 23:12.729
I get 10 free movie
rentals a week,

23:12.731 --> 23:15.391
15% off all Coca-Cola
branded products.

23:15.393 --> 23:16.359
Oh, and look,

23:17.934 --> 23:21.507
they let me (Italian mob voice)
take any of the Twizzlers

23:21.509 --> 23:24.004
that are past their
expiration date.

23:24.006 --> 23:25.841
Keep that between
you and me, okay?

23:26.712 --> 23:28.547
But it also means

23:28.549 --> 23:30.439
that I'm not gonna be
able to watch SNL anymore

23:30.441 --> 23:31.913
because Sequels closes at
midnight on Saturdays, so.

23:33.246 --> 23:34.245
- What, so I'm supposed
to watch it by myself

23:34.247 --> 23:35.620
like a fucking loser?

23:35.622 --> 23:37.116
- Sorry, man.

23:37.118 --> 23:38.953
I gotta be proactive
about my future.

23:38.955 --> 23:40.185
NYU costs $90,000

23:40.187 --> 23:42.220
and it's not like my parents

23:42.222 --> 23:43.925
are gonna buy everything for me.

23:47.359 --> 23:48.831
- [Audience Member]
Take off your hat.

23:58.238 --> 24:01.514
(Movie preview music)

24:10.591 --> 24:12.987
- "Punch Drunk Love"
is seriously like
the greatest movie

24:12.989 --> 24:14.725
I've ever seen in my life.

24:14.727 --> 24:16.595
- Why did Adam Sandler
need all that pudding --

24:16.597 --> 24:19.796
- Because it's the greatest
love story of our time, Matt!

24:19.798 --> 24:20.962
Oh my god,

24:20.964 --> 24:22.799
the scene where they kiss

24:22.801 --> 24:24.603
and the cameras do
that whooshing thing.

24:24.605 --> 24:27.606
And then you see their
shadows and it's like, ugh!

24:27.608 --> 24:29.608
And then all this stuff
with the Mattress Man.

24:29.610 --> 24:31.467

24:49.124 --> 24:50.057
- Get down.

24:52.160 --> 24:54.160
- What movie is she watching?

24:54.162 --> 24:59.033
- Lauren P. is so
good at editing.

24:59.035 --> 25:00.001
- So?

25:01.334 --> 25:05.710
- Well, I was thinking
maybe she could help us

25:05.712 --> 25:09.076
with like, the Year
End Video, you know?

25:10.376 --> 25:11.881

25:30.869 --> 25:33.067
- [Lawrence] (yawning) Almost.

25:37.645 --> 25:38.809
- I was wondering
what you thought

25:38.811 --> 25:40.437
about me coming to New York.

25:42.210 --> 25:44.309
- I thought you were going
to Aldershot next year.

25:44.311 --> 25:46.751
Aren't your parents making you?

25:46.753 --> 25:48.016
- Yeah, but I have
dual citizenship,

25:48.018 --> 25:49.545
so it's like, it's whatever.

25:53.991 --> 25:58.697
- Can I tell you something
like really honest

25:58.699 --> 26:01.557
and you have to promise you're
not gonna get mad at me?

26:02.593 --> 26:04.098
- Yeah.

26:04.100 --> 26:09.004
- Well, it's just like
after high school,

26:10.403 --> 26:11.941
I see myself having a
really different life

26:11.943 --> 26:16.209
with new friends who
share in my interests.

26:16.211 --> 26:18.574
- I just spent the whole day
with your fucking interests.

26:18.576 --> 26:21.148
- Yeah, you totally
did and that's great.

26:24.692 --> 26:25.625
I just,

26:27.057 --> 26:32.159
I think you might be
like a placeholder.

26:33.492 --> 26:35.393
- What the fuck
is a placeholder?

26:35.395 --> 26:36.636
- You know, like a friend
that you have in high school

26:38.266 --> 26:42.004
before you go to university and
make like your real friends.

26:44.074 --> 26:45.810
Like, I don't really
think it's a bad thing.

26:45.812 --> 26:47.339
If we're being honest,

26:47.341 --> 26:49.044
I'm probably your
placeholder too.

26:51.081 --> 26:53.114
It's just, I don't know.

26:54.821 --> 26:57.580
When I move to New York, I
see myself becoming like,

26:58.957 --> 27:00.792
like a completely
different person.

27:00.794 --> 27:01.617
- So you're just not gonna
want to be my friend?

27:01.619 --> 27:02.794
- No, no.

27:02.796 --> 27:04.323
No, in high school, it's fine.

27:04.325 --> 27:07.029
I just think that
like, you know,

27:07.031 --> 27:08.591
you should figure
out your own future

27:08.593 --> 27:12.628
before you decide to
copy mine or whatever.

See, this is why I didn't
even wanna say anything.

27:23.608 --> 27:24.783

I'll take old favorites
from action to comedy

28:08.554 --> 28:11.687
and we can all split games,
previously enjoyed, and retail.

28:11.689 --> 28:13.029
And Lawrence.

28:14.868 --> 28:15.768
Come here.

28:17.167 --> 28:20.036
Lawrence, you're gonna
get the very best job.

28:20.038 --> 28:22.698
You are gonna
watch this computer

28:22.700 --> 28:26.042
and make sure we scan everything
properly in the store.

28:26.044 --> 28:29.210
And if we can scan
everything in by 2:00 a.m.,

28:29.212 --> 28:32.345
we get to go to fucking bed.

28:32.347 --> 28:33.280
- Yay.

28:34.712 --> 28:36.349
- Let's do it.
- Yes.

28:39.354 --> 28:40.991
- Hey Lawrence, how's it going?

28:41.961 --> 28:43.356
- It's good, it's going good.

28:44.326 --> 28:45.721
- We're rocking it, guys.

28:50.035 --> 28:52.299
(blowing)

28:53.698 --> 28:54.873
- Yeah, cool.

28:54.875 --> 28:55.940
How 'bout that?

28:58.846 --> 29:03.948
(wondrous soft music)
(machinery beeping)

29:13.553 --> 29:16.488
- Okay, see you in
a few hours, lady.

29:16.490 --> 29:17.654
- Okay.

29:17.656 --> 29:19.458
Lawrence, nice working with you.

29:19.460 --> 29:21.801
Very awesome scanning.

29:22.903 --> 29:24.067
- (laughing) Thanks, Shannon.

29:24.069 --> 29:25.563
- Lawrence, you need a ride?

29:25.565 --> 29:27.103
- No, no, my mom's
coming to pick me up.

29:27.105 --> 29:28.434
I just gotta call
her when I'm ready.

29:28.436 --> 29:29.402
- What?

29:29.404 --> 29:30.909
It's 2:00 a.m.

29:30.911 --> 29:32.438
Your mom's still
waiting up for you?

29:32.440 --> 29:33.604
- Yo, if I called
my mom at 2:00 a.m.,

29:33.606 --> 29:34.440
she would beat my ass, man.

29:34.442 --> 29:35.639
What? She would.

29:35.641 --> 29:36.915
I would be hospitalized.

29:36.917 --> 29:38.081
- No, no, no.

29:38.083 --> 29:39.247
She likes driving me around.

29:39.249 --> 29:41.920
It makes her feel like, useful.

29:41.922 --> 29:43.119
- Okay, I'll drive him home.

29:43.121 --> 29:44.384
Where do you live, Lawrence?

29:44.386 --> 29:46.419
- Really, she doesn't mind.

29:46.421 --> 29:48.960
- Yo, stop being an
asshole to your mom, man.

29:48.962 --> 29:51.127
Just learn to drive.

29:51.129 --> 29:52.964
And I say that with love.

29:52.966 --> 29:53.965
- Let's go.
- Bye, team.

29:53.967 --> 29:55.263
- Bye.

29:55.265 --> 29:56.759
- Am I going with you?
- Yeah.

29:56.761 --> 29:58.332
- Oh.
- Yeah, we're having sex.

29:58.334 --> 29:59.905
- Okay, Lawrence,
go get your coat.

29:59.907 --> 30:01.137
We have two minutes
once I set the alarm.

30:02.437 --> 30:03.975
- Don't I get my 10
free rentals a week now?

30:03.977 --> 30:04.976
My trial period's over?

30:04.978 --> 30:06.010
- Now?

30:08.476 --> 30:10.542
(Alana sighing)

30:10.544 --> 30:11.741
Okay, but fast.

30:11.743 --> 30:13.050
You be so fast, Lawrence!

30:14.988 --> 30:17.747
(Alana sighing)

30:20.488 --> 30:21.454
Fuck.

30:27.968 --> 30:29.528
- All right.

30:29.530 --> 30:30.496
Bam.

30:33.798 --> 30:34.907
- All right.

30:36.372 --> 30:37.833
I can't let you rent these.

30:39.210 --> 30:40.836
You have a $45 late
fee on your account.

30:42.675 --> 30:44.180
- That doesn't make any sense.

30:44.182 --> 30:46.083
- Well, you never
returned "Wild Things"

30:46.085 --> 30:49.680
and it says you've had it
for the last three weeks.

30:50.716 --> 30:52.254
- Well--

30:52.256 --> 30:53.849
- That is the movie
where Denise Richards

30:53.851 --> 30:54.960
and Neve Campbell mash
their boobies together

30:54.962 --> 30:55.961
in a pool, right?

30:55.963 --> 30:57.963
- Well, I don't know

30:57.965 --> 30:59.360
because my friend
Matt Macarchuck rented
it on my account,

30:59.362 --> 31:01.263
but he said he
returned it weeks ago.

31:01.265 --> 31:03.727
- With the fakest fake name
I have literally ever heard.

31:03.729 --> 31:05.630
- Look, first thing,

31:05.632 --> 31:07.896
I'm gonna take "Wild Things"
out of his VHS player,

31:07.898 --> 31:09.073
rewind the whole tape,

31:09.075 --> 31:10.371
and then burn his house down

31:10.373 --> 31:11.867
because that's how much I care

31:11.869 --> 31:12.802
about the Sequels late
fee policy, Alana.

31:12.804 --> 31:13.869
I swear to God.

31:16.313 --> 31:17.675
- Yeah, we don't live
far away from each other.

31:17.677 --> 31:20.282
I'm at Tansley Woods.

31:20.284 --> 31:22.185
It's a really nice condo.

31:22.187 --> 31:27.058
I bought it myself last year
and I just got a new oven.

31:27.918 --> 31:29.885
- Oh, yeah, that's cool.

31:29.887 --> 31:32.558
Is it like gas range or...

31:34.925 --> 31:36.100
- It's only 2:15.

31:36.102 --> 31:37.970
Are you sure you don't want me

31:37.972 --> 31:39.136
to drop you off at like, a
friend's house or something?

31:40.106 --> 31:41.534
- I think I wanna go home

31:41.536 --> 31:42.568
and watch "The
Manchurian Candidate."

31:42.570 --> 31:43.503
- Really?

31:45.243 --> 31:46.935
I think you should
go to a party.

31:46.937 --> 31:48.574
- No, no.

31:48.576 --> 31:49.740
I like movies.

31:53.350 --> 31:54.283
- Right.

31:59.521 --> 32:01.389
Well, congratulations.

32:01.391 --> 32:04.095
You just survived
your first inventory.

32:05.923 --> 32:09.628
(soft contemplative music)

32:12.237 --> 32:13.500
- Okay.

32:13.502 --> 32:14.468
See ya.

32:17.770 --> 32:19.638
- Hello!

32:19.640 --> 32:22.905
Yeah, I think you forgot to
thank me for driving you home

32:22.907 --> 32:26.018
and also for being just the
greatest boss you have ever had.

32:28.121 --> 32:30.154
- Yeah, okay, bye.

32:31.157 --> 32:32.123
Thank you.

32:42.828 --> 32:47.963
(faint movie chatter)
(soft contemplative music)

33:02.122 --> 33:03.220
- [Actor] Spartacus!

33:07.952 --> 33:10.887
(Lawrence masturbating)

33:10.889 --> 33:13.626
(screaming)
- Oh, Jesus Christ!

33:13.628 --> 33:14.858
- Why are you still up?

33:14.860 --> 33:15.859
- I'm getting a glass of water.

33:15.861 --> 33:16.662
Why are you still up?

33:19.205 --> 33:20.501
- "Spartacus," I'm
watching "Spartacus."

33:20.503 --> 33:21.502
- Don't watch "Spartacus!"

33:21.504 --> 33:22.503
Go to sleep.

33:22.505 --> 33:23.372
It's a school night.

33:23.374 --> 33:25.033
- Okay.

33:25.035 --> 33:26.001
Goodnight.

33:28.874 --> 33:29.840
I love you.

33:29.842 --> 33:31.380
Goodnight.

33:31.382 --> 33:32.348
- Love you.

33:33.681 --> 33:34.647
Jesus.

33:39.885 --> 33:42.127
Okay, I'll pick you up at 4.

33:42.129 --> 33:43.062
- Okay.

33:58.343 --> 33:59.903
- [Sequels commercial]
It's almost Valentine's Day

33:59.905 --> 34:01.410
and love is in the air.

34:01.412 --> 34:03.709
- Hey Alana, are
you busy right now?

34:03.711 --> 34:04.875
- I'm--

34:04.877 --> 34:07.185
- Okay, okay, so I was thinking

34:07.187 --> 34:09.352
that we should have
like, a Staff Picks wall.

34:09.354 --> 34:10.518
- Oh.

34:10.520 --> 34:11.651
Yeah, we don't do that here.

34:11.653 --> 34:13.290
- Well, I know, yeah.

34:13.292 --> 34:15.193
But just imagine.
- Yeah.

34:15.195 --> 34:18.229
- A section of the store that's
all of our favourite movies.

34:18.231 --> 34:20.297
I was thinking I could
interview everyone on the team

34:20.299 --> 34:22.431
and write up little blurbs
to put next to them.

34:22.433 --> 34:25.401
And that it would be like,
really, really, really special.

34:27.064 --> 34:28.096
Also, I would do everything,

34:28.098 --> 34:29.669
like all the work.

34:29.671 --> 34:31.770
I promise you wouldn't
have to do a thing.

34:31.772 --> 34:33.673
- I mean, they do it
at the Appleby store

34:33.675 --> 34:37.380
and I think their manager said
it increased store revenue.

34:37.382 --> 34:40.845
- So, you're saying yes?

34:40.847 --> 34:42.154
- No.

34:42.156 --> 34:43.254
I'm saying:

34:46.787 --> 34:48.952
let's see how it goes.

34:48.954 --> 34:50.591
- Okay, that works for me.

34:50.593 --> 34:51.955
- Okay.

34:51.957 --> 34:52.956
- Okay.
- Cool, Lawrence.

34:52.958 --> 34:55.926
(Lawrence laughing)

34:57.237 --> 34:58.995
("Ode to Joy")

34:58.997 --> 35:00.634
- So Shannon,

35:00.636 --> 35:02.999
what do you love
about "Dirty Dancing?"

35:05.773 --> 35:10.149
- To begin with, the dancing.

35:12.285 --> 35:14.142
(balloon squeaking)

35:14.144 --> 35:15.979
- Brandon Lee didn't
deserve to die, man.

35:15.981 --> 35:18.289
He gave his life to "The Crow"
and now he lives forever.

35:18.291 --> 35:19.950
- That DVD scares me, man.

35:19.952 --> 35:21.919
It looks evil on the shelf.

35:21.921 --> 35:22.755
- Oh yeah, bro.

35:22.757 --> 35:23.756
"The Crow?"

35:23.758 --> 35:24.922
That one got you, bro.

35:24.924 --> 35:26.693
- [Shannon] What about dogs?

35:26.695 --> 35:28.431
- Are you just saying movies
that have dogs in them

35:28.433 --> 35:30.092
because that's
not very original.

35:30.094 --> 35:31.599
- What about dog actors?

35:31.601 --> 35:33.634
Like dogs, if they
were played by humans,

35:33.636 --> 35:35.834
they'd win an Oscar every time.

35:35.836 --> 35:36.967
- Oh my god, Shannon.

35:36.969 --> 35:38.276
You're a genius.

35:38.278 --> 35:39.640
(bubble popping)

35:39.642 --> 35:41.345
(upbeat music)

35:41.347 --> 35:43.644
- Are you sure you're
the manager? - Okay.

35:43.646 --> 35:44.810
- You're way too
sexy to be a manager.

35:44.812 --> 35:45.646
- I'm the manager.

35:45.648 --> 35:47.483
I'm very sure.

35:47.485 --> 35:48.649
- I need to see some ID
for this regulation hottie.

35:48.651 --> 35:49.650
- Wow, you just had that.

35:49.652 --> 35:50.552
Lawrence, later, okay?

35:51.357 --> 35:54.182
(upbeat music)

35:54.184 --> 35:55.722
- "The Crow" got me
through high school.

35:55.724 --> 35:57.229
It got me through
my parent's divorce.

35:57.231 --> 35:59.264
It got getting cheated
on by my fiance

35:59.266 --> 36:04.368
who is a bitch, by the way.

36:06.372 --> 36:07.701
- Huh.

36:07.703 --> 36:08.834
This is actually,

36:09.639 --> 36:10.869
really great work.

36:11.641 --> 36:14.312
(upbeat music)

36:14.314 --> 36:17.744
(cash register dinging)

36:22.883 --> 36:28.018
(error noise)
(Lawrence sighing)

36:33.498 --> 36:34.431
- Yo.

36:35.225 --> 36:36.400
- Yo, Matt.

36:36.402 --> 36:37.863
You're late.

36:37.865 --> 36:39.634
- Yeah, me and Lauren
went to Wendy's.

36:39.636 --> 36:41.031
- We brought you a frosty.

36:46.346 --> 36:47.972
- I mean, yeah.

36:47.974 --> 36:49.380
I'll take the Frosty for sure,

36:49.382 --> 36:51.382
but she's gotta go.

36:53.584 --> 36:56.145
- Well, Matt was saying you
guys could use an editor

36:56.147 --> 36:57.982
and I'd love to take a
look at your footage.

36:57.984 --> 37:00.325
Trust me, you do not wanna
edit on this computer.

37:00.327 --> 37:02.360
I've had so many
rendering issues

37:02.362 --> 37:05.759
and my dad bought me Final
Cut Pro for my birthday.

37:05.761 --> 37:08.025
- Well, that's just
terrific, sweetheart,

37:08.027 --> 37:10.027
but the Year End
Video's our thing,

37:10.029 --> 37:12.832
so there's really
no groupies allowed.

37:12.834 --> 37:14.504
- Wow, you're being
really sexist right now.

37:14.506 --> 37:16.066
- How is that sexist?

37:16.068 --> 37:18.035
- Lawrence, a lot of
great film directors

37:18.037 --> 37:21.940
have worked with female
editors like Dede Allen.

37:21.942 --> 37:25.878
She helped Arthur Penn
make "Bonnie and Clyde."

37:25.880 --> 37:29.915
And Sally Menke.

37:29.917 --> 37:31.521
She edited--
- "Pulp Fiction."

37:31.523 --> 37:33.017
- "Pulp Fiction."

37:33.019 --> 37:36.559
And Thelma Schoon?
- Schoonmaker.

37:36.561 --> 37:39.056
Schoon.
- Smhoonmaker,

37:39.058 --> 37:41.597
she edited--
- "GoodFellas."

37:41.599 --> 37:42.928
- "GoodFellas!"

37:42.930 --> 37:44.798
- She edited
"GoodFellas," Lawrence!

37:44.800 --> 37:48.307
- Did you guys go to Wendy's
and prepare a fucking speech?

37:49.266 --> 37:50.507
No, Matt.

37:51.477 --> 37:53.642
Lauren P is not involved.

37:53.644 --> 37:55.710
Like, you're really gonna
have to make a decision here

37:55.712 --> 37:57.844
whether you wanna make
a movie with me or--

37:57.846 --> 37:59.417
- Okay.

37:59.419 --> 38:00.946
It's very obvious you
don't actually care

38:00.948 --> 38:01.947
about the Year End
Video here, so.

38:01.949 --> 38:03.487
- I care, I care a lot.

38:03.489 --> 38:04.785
I just think we need to
keep shooting footage.

38:04.787 --> 38:06.622
- Okay.

38:06.624 --> 38:08.184
Well, I have the video camera
and Lauren has Final Cut,

38:08.186 --> 38:10.791
so we don't really know
how you can contribute.

38:12.223 --> 38:14.399
- So you're just gonna
kick me off my own film?

38:14.401 --> 38:15.334
- Well.

38:18.768 --> 38:21.032
Hey, Lauren,

38:21.034 --> 38:22.572
did Matt ever tell you about

38:22.574 --> 38:25.476
how he jerks off
like 98 times a day

38:25.478 --> 38:27.335
and he likes to drive
to your house at night

38:27.337 --> 38:30.613
and park outside, so he can
like, you know, stalk you?

38:30.615 --> 38:32.516
Right?

38:32.518 --> 38:36.146
And Matt, "Wild Things" has
a three week late fee on it.

38:36.148 --> 38:37.983
$46, man.

38:37.985 --> 38:40.249
Like, I don't care

38:40.251 --> 38:42.460
that that's your favorite
movie to jerk off to!

38:42.462 --> 38:44.891
My store really
needs it back, okay?!

38:44.893 --> 38:46.024
It's important!

38:54.936 --> 38:55.869
- No!

38:58.302 --> 39:00.137
You don't deserve a Frosty.

39:04.715 --> 39:07.749
(moody rock music)

39:18.531 --> 39:20.663
- So, how long have
you worked here for?

39:22.799 --> 39:23.996
- Four years.

39:25.329 --> 39:27.736
- That's like, a
really long time.

39:27.738 --> 39:28.704
- Yeah.

39:30.037 --> 39:31.674
- Well, did you ever
wanna do anything else

39:31.676 --> 39:35.172
like go to university,
have a career?

39:35.174 --> 39:37.449
- I have a career.

39:43.589 --> 39:47.349
Hey, yeah, that's not
how you stock the fridge.

39:47.351 --> 39:48.185
- It's not?

39:48.187 --> 39:50.055
- No.

39:50.057 --> 39:51.958
See, you're putting all of
the new pop in the front

39:51.960 --> 39:53.861
so that if a customer grabs
one thinking that it's cold,

39:53.863 --> 39:56.897
they're just gonna end up with
like, a lukewarm beverage.

39:59.198 --> 40:03.508
So take everything
out and start over.

40:03.510 --> 40:04.443
- Okay.

40:11.848 --> 40:14.849
- Yeah, like, I went
to Guelph for awhile.

40:14.851 --> 40:16.279
- Oh, that's cool, yeah.

40:16.281 --> 40:17.819
I'm graduating this year,

40:17.821 --> 40:20.492
but I don't think I
want to go to Guelph.

40:20.494 --> 40:22.087
- Well, where else
did you apply?

40:22.089 --> 40:22.923
- [Lawrence] Nowhere.

40:22.925 --> 40:23.891
Just NYU.

40:26.093 --> 40:28.225
- Lawrence, do me a favor

40:28.227 --> 40:31.294
and apply to least one
Canadian university please?

40:31.296 --> 40:33.197
Just like, you
know, as a backup.

40:33.199 --> 40:34.000
- Why?

40:34.002 --> 40:35.540
I don't need to.

40:35.542 --> 40:37.102
- Because NYU is
kind of a long shot

40:37.104 --> 40:38.433
and you don't want to

40:38.435 --> 40:39.973
end up going to no universities.

40:39.975 --> 40:41.810
You're gonna be -

40:41.812 --> 40:44.945
Oh my god, what the fuck?!

40:44.947 --> 40:46.947
Someone threw a Gordita.

40:46.949 --> 40:48.553
- [Lawrence] Oh, weird.

40:48.555 --> 40:50.918
Well, what's the best
film school in Canada?

40:50.920 --> 40:51.919
- What? I don't know.

40:51.921 --> 40:53.283
Like, Ryerson?

40:53.285 --> 40:54.757
The gay and lesbian section.

40:54.759 --> 40:55.923
This is like a
fucking hate crime!

40:55.925 --> 40:57.760
- Do they shoot on 16-mm?

40:57.762 --> 40:59.630
'Cause I really need to
know how to shoot on 16-mm.

40:59.632 --> 41:01.489
- There's all crushed up
ground beef in the carpet.

41:01.491 --> 41:03.029
- What did you major in?
- It's fucking disgusting.

41:03.031 --> 41:04.602
Shit, we're gonna
get ants again.

41:04.604 --> 41:05.427
- Alana, what did
you take at Guelph?

41:05.429 --> 41:07.396
- Oh, fuck.

41:07.398 --> 41:08.496
Theatre.

41:08.498 --> 41:09.607
- Really?

41:09.609 --> 41:10.773
What did you want to be,

41:10.775 --> 41:13.039
a director, actor, playwright?

41:13.811 --> 41:14.777
- An actor.

41:15.615 --> 41:16.581
- [Lawrence] Cool.

41:18.112 --> 41:19.045
- Yeah,

41:20.620 --> 41:23.951
but then like, my
roommate committed suicide

41:23.953 --> 41:25.755
in my first year.

41:25.757 --> 41:27.218
So then obviously, I
didn't go back after that.

41:32.995 --> 41:34.797
Hey, it's okay.

41:34.799 --> 41:36.491
Look, I'm okay now.

41:40.838 --> 41:43.575
Can you please make your
face into another face?

41:47.207 --> 41:48.646
Okay.

41:48.648 --> 41:50.505
Okay, just watch the counter.

41:50.507 --> 41:51.682
All right?

41:51.684 --> 41:53.376
I'm gonna get the steam cleaner.

41:54.511 --> 41:55.917
Fucking bastards.

41:59.351 --> 42:00.515
Fuck.

42:00.517 --> 42:04.090
("I Like Movies" main theme)

42:13.497 --> 42:14.430
- Yes.

42:15.708 --> 42:17.004
Yes.

42:17.006 --> 42:17.939
Yes.

42:18.843 --> 42:19.776
No.

42:21.681 --> 42:23.813
- Ooh, my little baby!

42:23.815 --> 42:24.748
Oh she's so little.

42:26.180 --> 42:28.015
What are the books
doing on the floor?

42:28.017 --> 42:29.511
- I'm trying to decide
what to bring to New York.

42:29.513 --> 42:31.183
I'm just trying to
pack light, you know?

42:31.185 --> 42:32.184
The essentials.

42:32.186 --> 42:33.185
- Come help me please.

42:37.796 --> 42:40.159
Derek was a really disgusting
prick this morning, okay?

42:40.161 --> 42:41.589
Can I tell you what he said?

42:41.591 --> 42:43.195
- No, I don't--

42:43.197 --> 42:44.933
- As I walked into
the office, okay.

42:44.935 --> 42:48.398
Hey Terri, did you
get breast implants?

42:48.400 --> 42:50.202
So I say, "You know what?

42:50.204 --> 42:51.775
I don't think that's
an appropriate thing

42:51.777 --> 42:53.744
to say to your office
manager there, Derek."

42:53.746 --> 42:54.569
- Yeah, that's gross.

42:54.571 --> 42:55.570
That sucks.

42:56.881 --> 42:59.409
Um, so Alana was telling
me I need a backup.

42:59.411 --> 43:01.851
She says I need to apply to
at least one Canadian school

43:01.853 --> 43:03.919
in case I don't get into NYU.

43:05.285 --> 43:07.956
So I was talking to the
guidance counselor today

43:07.958 --> 43:09.485
and they were telling me that I,

43:09.487 --> 43:11.729
that the deadline is
yeah, well, today,

43:11.731 --> 43:12.862
and I just really need--

43:12.864 --> 43:13.929
- Okay, so.

43:14.767 --> 43:16.294
Go back. Who's Alana?

43:16.296 --> 43:17.900
- Mom, you're not
even listening!

43:17.902 --> 43:20.771
That's my manager at Sequels.

43:20.773 --> 43:22.300
Okay.

43:22.302 --> 43:23.972
So I need to apply on
this stupid website

43:23.974 --> 43:25.468
called OUAC by midnight.

43:25.470 --> 43:27.437
And I was just
wondering what school

43:27.439 --> 43:28.779
you thought I should apply to

43:28.781 --> 43:30.077
'cause I kind of need to decide

43:30.079 --> 43:32.750
in like the next three hours.

43:32.752 --> 43:34.279
- Okay.

43:34.281 --> 43:35.544
What's the easiest
school to get into?

43:35.546 --> 43:36.721
- Mom --

43:36.723 --> 43:38.756
- Sorry, I said something wrong.

43:38.758 --> 43:39.691
Imagine that.

43:41.420 --> 43:42.584
What about Carleton?

43:43.455 --> 43:44.586
Your dad went there.

43:48.031 --> 43:48.964
- I mean,

43:50.165 --> 43:52.869
like yeah, yeah, I mean.

43:54.334 --> 43:55.630
Is that a good school?

43:56.600 --> 43:59.975
Was dad like, happy there?

44:01.913 --> 44:03.440
- Yeah, I think he loved it.

44:06.511 --> 44:08.115
- Well, yours
changes every week.

44:08.117 --> 44:10.150
Last week, you said it
was "Eyes Wide Shut,"

44:10.152 --> 44:12.482
which is really gross and weird.

44:12.484 --> 44:14.825
- Well, that's just
because Stanley Kubrick's

44:14.827 --> 44:16.024
my favorite director right now.

44:16.026 --> 44:17.960
But please, just tell me.

44:17.962 --> 44:20.127
- No, I'm not obsessed with
movies the same way you are.

44:20.129 --> 44:22.800
And I actually, I might
even hate them now.

44:25.101 --> 44:26.463
I used to work in the industry.

44:26.465 --> 44:27.365
- Really?
- Mm.

44:27.367 --> 44:28.531
- As what?

44:28.533 --> 44:30.874
- Look me up on IMDB sometime.

44:33.703 --> 44:34.977
Okay, okay.

44:34.979 --> 44:36.748
I will give you a hint.

44:41.711 --> 44:45.889
Red rum, red rum,
red rum, red rum.

44:45.891 --> 44:48.727
- Oh my god, Alana, are you
saying it's "The Shining?"

44:49.620 --> 44:51.422
- No.

44:51.424 --> 44:52.863
I just knew that would give
you like, a huge boner.

44:56.660 --> 45:01.773
(bell ringing)
(students chattering)

45:09.442 --> 45:12.410
(locker slamming)

45:13.743 --> 45:17.712
(lock clattering)
- Come on, okay.

45:21.993 --> 45:24.224
- [Student] Yeah,
yeah, let's go.

45:24.226 --> 45:26.523
- Yeah, that's great.

45:26.525 --> 45:28.690
Maybe stay a little
bit more to this side

45:28.692 --> 45:30.934
and then the light will get
your faces a little bit more.

45:30.936 --> 45:33.167
Yeah, nice.

45:33.169 --> 45:34.102
Yeah.

45:35.402 --> 45:36.907
What do you think?

45:36.909 --> 45:38.876
- [Matt] I think it
looks really good, yeah.

45:38.878 --> 45:40.405
- I don't know.

45:40.407 --> 45:41.571
I just hope you guys
aren't overexposed

45:41.573 --> 45:42.770
and I don't know, it just -

45:42.772 --> 45:43.881
- [Brendan] It's payday.

45:43.883 --> 45:46.081
- Oh.
- Yeah, okay.

45:46.083 --> 45:47.049
All right.

45:54.553 --> 45:56.861
- Hey, Brendan?
- Yeah, bro?

45:56.863 --> 45:58.588
- Can you come here?

45:58.590 --> 46:00.128
I think there's like, something
wrong with my paycheck.

46:00.130 --> 46:01.426
- Something wrong
with your paycheck?

46:01.428 --> 46:02.361
Let me see.

46:06.169 --> 46:07.839
That looks okay to me.

46:09.238 --> 46:12.173
- But I need to save up
$90,000 US by September.

46:13.143 --> 46:14.307
- Okay.

46:14.309 --> 46:15.473
- If I'm working all the time,

46:15.475 --> 46:17.046
why don't I have any money?

46:17.048 --> 46:18.344
- Okay, so Sequels
takes money out

46:18.346 --> 46:19.950
for your like, RSP funds,

46:19.952 --> 46:21.809
and your employment
benefits, and stuff.

46:21.811 --> 46:23.646
- Okay, I don't want all that.

46:23.648 --> 46:25.318
I want to save all my
money so I can go to NYU.

46:26.255 --> 46:27.650
- I'm sorry.

46:27.652 --> 46:29.256
Have you never had a job before?

46:29.258 --> 46:31.720
- [Lauren] Okay, no, no,
no, let's try to get it.

46:31.722 --> 46:33.425
Let's try together, yeah.

46:33.427 --> 46:35.790
(giggling)

46:36.903 --> 46:38.265
(bell ringing)

46:38.267 --> 46:39.266
- Okay, have a great day.

46:39.268 --> 46:41.037
And don't forget,

46:41.039 --> 46:43.039
your Marshall McLuhan book
reports are due next Wednesday.

46:44.405 --> 46:47.505
The medium is the
homework! (laughing)

46:49.080 --> 46:52.378
Hey, Matt, Lawrence,
can we chat?

46:59.486 --> 47:02.619
So, you promised me
a cut in February.

47:02.621 --> 47:04.423
It's now March.

47:04.425 --> 47:06.227
So what is happening
with that Year End Video?

47:06.229 --> 47:09.329
- Oh yes, yeah,
we're nearly there.

47:09.331 --> 47:10.660
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

47:10.662 --> 47:11.661
- Okay.

47:11.663 --> 47:13.168
Matt, is this true?

47:13.170 --> 47:15.005
- I don't know.

47:15.007 --> 47:16.633
I haven't really been working
with Lawrence at all, so.

47:16.635 --> 47:18.503
- Well, I think it was just more

47:18.505 --> 47:19.944
we were having some
creative differences--

47:19.946 --> 47:21.440
- Okay, is there anything

47:21.442 --> 47:24.311
that I can show to
the principal at all?

47:24.313 --> 47:25.576
- Me and Lauren P.
can show you a cut

47:25.578 --> 47:27.677
of the Year End Video on Monday.

47:27.679 --> 47:29.118
We're working together now, so.

47:29.120 --> 47:30.713
- Wait, Lauren's involved?

47:30.715 --> 47:31.549
- Yeah.

47:31.551 --> 47:33.452
- That's great!

47:33.454 --> 47:34.882
Hey, did you hear she got
into film school at Ryerson?

47:34.884 --> 47:36.422
- Yeah, I know.

47:36.424 --> 47:37.555
She's really good
at like, film stuff.

47:37.557 --> 47:38.820
She's really cool.

47:38.822 --> 47:40.393
- Mr. Olenick,

47:40.395 --> 47:41.966
I don't think it's
fair for Lauren P.

47:41.968 --> 47:43.495
to get credit on
the Year End Video

47:43.497 --> 47:45.299
when I never asked
her to be involved.

47:45.301 --> 47:47.301
- Well, don't women need
opportunities to get involved?

47:47.303 --> 47:49.699
- [Lawrence] Yeah,
but she's a poser.

47:53.078 --> 47:54.605
- Okay.

47:54.607 --> 47:57.575
Matt, I am really
looking forward

47:57.577 --> 47:59.115
to what you and Lauren create.

47:59.117 --> 48:00.281
Go for it.

48:00.283 --> 48:01.282
- Thank you, Mr. Olenick.

48:04.056 --> 48:08.091
- Hey Lawrence, are you okay?

48:08.093 --> 48:09.961
- If you're not going in,

48:09.963 --> 48:10.995
you have to call Sequels and
you have to let them know.

48:10.997 --> 48:11.820
Come on.

48:11.822 --> 48:12.821
- I know that.

48:12.823 --> 48:14.999
Obviously, I have to go.

48:15.001 --> 48:15.791
I have to go.

48:15.793 --> 48:16.660
I just.

48:16.662 --> 48:18.233
- Lawrence.

48:18.235 --> 48:19.762
- Just let me rest for
like, 10 more minutes.

48:21.106 --> 48:22.501
- Oh my god.

48:22.503 --> 48:23.436
Wow.

48:24.274 --> 48:25.240
Lawrence.

48:26.573 --> 48:31.279
You are 40 minutes late.
- We had car trouble.

48:31.281 --> 48:32.841
- You'll have to get changed.

48:32.843 --> 48:34.381
- Yeah, I'll just
be like one second.

48:34.383 --> 48:35.382
- Like, Lawrence, like
you're really late.

48:35.384 --> 48:37.648
Like, please hurry up.

48:40.290 --> 48:43.324
(Lawrence panting)

48:52.368 --> 48:53.367
- Oh, fuck.

48:56.075 --> 49:01.144
(Lawrence panting)
(dissonant ambient music)

49:11.618 --> 49:13.057
Ah, fuck.

49:13.059 --> 49:17.622
(slapping)
(Lawrence sobbing)

49:20.924 --> 49:22.099
(knocking on door)

49:22.101 --> 49:23.925
- [Terri] Hey, are you okay?

49:23.927 --> 49:25.201
Open the door.

49:26.105 --> 49:27.038
Lawrence.

49:30.934 --> 49:33.506
- Great, so "Jumanji"
is due Thursday at noon.

49:33.508 --> 49:34.771
- Hey, Alana, I think
we have a problem.

49:34.773 --> 49:36.278
Can I talk to you?

49:36.280 --> 49:38.181
- Is Lawrence still
getting changed?

49:38.183 --> 49:39.182
- Actually, he just locked
himself in the back room.

49:39.184 --> 49:40.744
I'm not really sure why.

49:40.746 --> 49:41.910
- I'll take the next
customer in line.

49:41.912 --> 49:43.483
- Look, I know that you can tell

49:43.485 --> 49:45.287
that Lawrence is not
like a regular kid.

49:45.289 --> 49:46.453
- [Alana] I can't
do this right now.

49:46.455 --> 49:48.257
- I mean, you know, I love him.

49:48.259 --> 49:49.654
It's just that he has
serious emotional problems.

49:49.656 --> 49:50.919
- I can't.

49:50.921 --> 49:52.459
- Look, I'm sure
that he told you

49:52.461 --> 49:53.625
that his father
committed suicide

49:53.627 --> 49:55.165
about four years ago, right?

49:55.167 --> 49:56.166
He used to use it as an
excuse for everything

49:56.168 --> 49:58.102
like to get out of gym

49:58.104 --> 49:59.565
or if he didn't like what
TV show you were watching.

49:59.567 --> 50:01.435
- Sorry.

50:01.437 --> 50:02.832
- But I need to get into
the back room and I'm sorry.

50:02.834 --> 50:04.306
I'm sorry.
- No, that's okay.

50:04.308 --> 50:05.142
- I know that
you're really busy.

50:05.144 --> 50:06.176
- You know what?

50:06.178 --> 50:07.342
I'm really sorry.

50:07.344 --> 50:08.508
Like, I didn't know all that,

50:08.510 --> 50:10.180
but I'm down two employees

50:10.182 --> 50:11.874
and I have no one
to help me on cash.

50:11.876 --> 50:13.381
So I'll go and check on him

50:13.383 --> 50:15.185
as soon as the line calms down.

50:15.187 --> 50:16.384
I'll help you over here.

50:16.386 --> 50:17.550
What is she doing?

50:17.552 --> 50:19.486
Hey, can you help Alana please?

50:19.488 --> 50:20.916
- What's going on?
- Nothing, it's--

50:20.918 --> 50:22.489
- No, it's actually not nothing.

50:22.491 --> 50:23.193
- Shannon, just go
back to returns.

50:23.195 --> 50:24.359
- Okay.

50:24.361 --> 50:25.525
I'm over here if you need me.

50:25.527 --> 50:27.021
- Is Brendan back from Staples

50:27.023 --> 50:28.528
because we're all
out of receipt paper?

50:28.530 --> 50:29.793
- [Shannon] I think
he just called.

50:29.795 --> 50:30.827
- I can take someone here.

50:30.829 --> 50:32.334
"8 Miles?"

50:32.336 --> 50:33.863
This is about that
guy, that Eminem guy.

50:33.865 --> 50:35.029
- I'm just gonna get
you checked out here.

50:35.031 --> 50:35.700
- Shannon, what else do I do?

50:35.702 --> 50:37.207
- Okay.

50:37.209 --> 50:38.208
First, we're gonna scan
the membership card.

50:38.210 --> 50:39.033
- Okay, that's it.

50:39.035 --> 50:40.573
Let's go.

50:40.575 --> 50:42.179
Shannon, you're in charge.
- Okay.

50:42.181 --> 50:43.246
- [Terri] Shannon,
you're in charge.

50:43.248 --> 50:44.544
- Don't do that.
- Okay.

50:45.679 --> 50:47.217
- Hi.

50:47.219 --> 50:49.384
- Hey Lawrence?
(knocking on door)

50:49.386 --> 50:51.419
Your mom says you're upset.

50:51.421 --> 50:54.048
Can I open the door?

50:54.050 --> 50:56.083
- [Lawrence] No,
don't come in please.

50:56.085 --> 50:57.260
- [Terri] Hey, honey?

50:57.262 --> 50:58.855
- [Alana] Okay, so Lawrence,

50:58.857 --> 51:00.087
you can take the next 30
minutes in there, okay,

51:00.089 --> 51:01.825
and just like, cool down.

51:01.827 --> 51:05.334
And then I need you
back on cash at 6.

51:05.336 --> 51:06.335
Okay.

51:06.337 --> 51:07.468
And your mom's here.

51:07.470 --> 51:09.602
If you want to talk to her.

51:09.604 --> 51:10.603
- [Terri] Hey, honey.

51:10.605 --> 51:11.439
How are you doing?

51:14.246 --> 51:19.381
- I can't, I can't, I can't.

51:21.187 --> 51:23.044
- Okay, what can't you do?

51:23.046 --> 51:24.815
- [Lawrence] I can't
like, like breathe!

51:24.817 --> 51:26.718
- Okay, I need you to breathe.

51:26.720 --> 51:27.653
Okay, so.

51:31.263 --> 51:33.164
- [Lawrence] Lauren P.
already got into Ryerson.

51:33.166 --> 51:36.057
I'm not gonna get into
any schools at all!

51:36.059 --> 51:37.597
- Okay. (shushing)

51:37.599 --> 51:39.731
Okay, we're not thinking
about that right now.

51:39.733 --> 51:41.370
You just need to
calm down, okay?

51:41.372 --> 51:44.406
So, okay, I want you
to close your eyes

51:45.706 --> 51:48.410
and just imagine,
just imagine an ocean.

51:48.412 --> 51:53.481
Imagine the ocean
in "Cast Away."

51:54.583 --> 51:56.077
Okay?

51:56.079 --> 51:57.848
You still like
that movie, right?

51:57.850 --> 51:59.289
- It's, it's--

51:59.291 --> 52:01.225
- [Terri] Remember to breathe.

52:01.227 --> 52:02.754
Okay?

52:02.756 --> 52:04.085
And you tell Wilson
what the water's like.

52:08.157 --> 52:09.123
- It's warm.

52:11.567 --> 52:13.435
- [Terri] That's great.

52:13.437 --> 52:14.370
What else?

52:21.478 --> 52:22.609
- It's blue.

52:26.648 --> 52:27.680
- Yep, it's blue.

52:31.884 --> 52:32.850
- [Alana] Hey.

52:36.394 --> 52:38.460
- I'm just waiting for my
mom to come pick me up.

52:38.462 --> 52:39.395
- Okay.

52:41.465 --> 52:43.729
(sighing)

52:44.699 --> 52:45.995
Are you feeling better?

52:47.405 --> 52:48.503
- Yeah, yeah.

52:50.705 --> 52:52.309
I don't know what
happened back there.

52:52.311 --> 52:55.642
I just like, forgot how
to breathe or something.

52:57.041 --> 52:58.249
- [Alana] Oh my god.

52:59.351 --> 53:00.515
I'm really sorry.

53:03.421 --> 53:05.047
- It's okay.

53:05.049 --> 53:06.686
- Did you hear back from NYU?

53:08.723 --> 53:10.184
- I'm not gonna get into NYU.
- Huh?

53:11.858 --> 53:14.991
- I'm probably not gonna
get into any universities.

53:14.993 --> 53:16.564
My mom says my life is supposed

53:16.566 --> 53:18.599
to get a lot better
after high school.

53:19.569 --> 53:21.470
That's when she blossomed

53:21.472 --> 53:24.539
and I'm apparently a late
bloomer or whatever too.

53:27.511 --> 53:29.104
But I'm just about to graduate

53:30.481 --> 53:33.713
and it is so depressing to know

53:33.715 --> 53:36.716
that I have to go through
the rest of my life as like,

53:36.718 --> 53:39.356
just me.

53:42.493 --> 53:43.459
- Yeah.

53:43.461 --> 53:48.431
Well, I get that.

53:54.934 --> 53:59.970
So your mom told
me about your dad.

54:02.381 --> 54:04.040
- She did?

54:04.042 --> 54:05.074
- I'm really sorry.

54:09.421 --> 54:10.244
- Yeah.

54:10.246 --> 54:11.179
Well,

54:12.490 --> 54:14.523
actually, I was
like, thinking about

54:16.890 --> 54:18.956
what you were saying
about your roommate.

54:20.597 --> 54:24.291
And you're kind of like,
the only other person I know

54:24.293 --> 54:28.471
who's like, had to deal
with that, so just.

54:49.626 --> 54:51.362
(Alana sighing)

54:51.364 --> 54:54.024
- Hey, you're gonna
get into NYU, okay?

54:55.126 --> 54:57.632
Hey, I like believe in you.

54:59.702 --> 55:00.668
- Thank you.

55:02.837 --> 55:04.639
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

55:05.477 --> 55:07.004
- Okay.

55:07.006 --> 55:08.610
- Yeah, my mom will be
here any minute anyways.

55:08.612 --> 55:10.645
- Okay, okay, okay.

55:10.647 --> 55:11.844
Just get home safe, okay?

55:11.846 --> 55:12.944
- Yeah, you too.

55:14.387 --> 55:15.419
- [Alana] Bye, Lawrence.

55:15.421 --> 55:16.354
- Bye.

55:18.853 --> 55:22.558
(soft contemplative music)

55:38.675 --> 55:40.037
- Hey.

55:40.039 --> 55:44.481
There you go.

55:44.483 --> 55:45.416
What's wrong?

55:46.716 --> 55:48.375
- It's not a perfect slice.

55:48.377 --> 55:49.376
(Terri sighing)

55:49.378 --> 55:51.246
Like, I'll still eat it,

55:51.248 --> 55:52.588
but you should really learn
how to cut a quiche, mom.

55:52.590 --> 55:54.216
- Like some wine?

55:54.218 --> 55:55.690
- I'm fine with root beer.

56:00.191 --> 56:02.389
- I know today's a hard day,

56:02.391 --> 56:07.031
so I would like to make
a toast before you eat.

56:09.706 --> 56:14.841
To Jeff, wherever you
are, happy birthday.

56:15.481 --> 56:16.414
We love you.

56:17.483 --> 56:18.713
- Yeah.

56:18.715 --> 56:19.879
Love you, dad.

56:19.881 --> 56:20.847
- Cheers.

56:25.018 --> 56:26.754
You know, we don't
have that much time

56:26.756 --> 56:28.723
until you go to school.

56:28.725 --> 56:31.220
We should do like
this more often.

56:31.222 --> 56:32.353
- You don't even like me.

56:32.355 --> 56:35.125
- Yes, I do.

56:35.127 --> 56:36.929
Actually, I'm
pretty proud of you

56:38.735 --> 56:43.870
because Carleton is offering
you a $10,000 scholarship.

57:00.449 --> 57:02.988
(laughing)

57:02.990 --> 57:05.188
Huh, aren't you excited?

57:05.190 --> 57:07.025
- Yeah,

57:07.027 --> 57:08.829
but like, Carleton doesn't
even have a real film program.

57:08.831 --> 57:10.501
- No, yes they do.

57:10.503 --> 57:12.096
You can major in Film Studies.

57:12.098 --> 57:14.362
- Yeah, but that means
I can't shoot in 16-mm,

57:14.364 --> 57:16.067
or have Todd Solondz as
my teacher, or like--

57:16.069 --> 57:18.234
- You know what
my mom said to me?

57:18.236 --> 57:19.774
She said I had three options.

57:19.776 --> 57:22.579
I could be a teacher, a
secretary, or a nurse.

57:22.581 --> 57:24.548
I thought, I hate needles.

57:24.550 --> 57:26.110
I don't like children
all that much.

57:26.112 --> 57:27.881
I guess I'll have
to be a secretary.

57:27.883 --> 57:29.278
- So because your
parents ruined your life,

57:29.280 --> 57:30.279
you have to ruin mine?

57:30.281 --> 57:32.116
- No.

57:32.118 --> 57:33.788
What I'm saying is we can't
afford you to go to NYU

57:33.790 --> 57:36.153
because your single
mom is a secretary.

57:38.564 --> 57:40.058
But you're gonna love Ottawa.

57:40.060 --> 57:41.158
The nation's capital
is very pretty.

57:41.160 --> 57:42.324
- Oh my god.

57:42.326 --> 57:44.392
It's the nation's crapital, mom.

57:44.394 --> 57:45.393
God.

57:46.605 --> 57:48.132
Pass me some garlic bread.

57:57.682 --> 57:59.275
- I don't think the person

57:59.277 --> 58:01.849
that wants you to accept
that $10,000 scholarship

58:02.819 --> 58:04.148
is trying to ruin your life.

58:05.118 --> 58:07.184
I think that person loves you

58:08.517 --> 58:09.989
and doesn't want
you to be in debt.

58:12.697 --> 58:15.456
Can you give in just once?

58:15.458 --> 58:16.963
- No!

58:16.965 --> 58:19.801
I told you, I'm
holding out for NYU!

58:19.803 --> 58:21.198
- Okay.

58:21.200 --> 58:21.869
Then I'm not
driving you to work.

58:21.871 --> 58:23.035
- What?

58:23.037 --> 58:24.201
- I'm not driving you anywhere--

58:24.203 --> 58:25.807
- No, you have to drive me!

58:25.809 --> 58:27.644
- Until you see this
as a viable option.

58:27.646 --> 58:28.843
- If I can't get to work,
I'm gonna lose my job.

58:28.845 --> 58:29.844
Seriously?!
- Mm-hmm.

58:29.846 --> 58:31.307
You know, sometimes,

58:31.309 --> 58:32.715
I think dad killed
himself because of you.

58:32.717 --> 58:33.540
- Yeah?

58:33.542 --> 58:35.047
You know what?!

58:35.049 --> 58:36.917
I think he was smart.

58:36.919 --> 58:39.480
I would love to kill myself
so I could get away from you!

58:43.794 --> 58:45.024
- Happy birthday, dad.

58:50.394 --> 58:51.360
- Hey.

59:05.013 --> 59:06.177
- [Customer] Goodbye.

59:06.179 --> 59:07.343
- Bye, have a good night.

59:07.345 --> 59:08.817
- [Customer] Thanks, you too.

59:11.481 --> 59:13.019
- Hey, thanks for
cleaning all the -

59:13.021 --> 59:14.757
Hey, can you?

59:14.759 --> 59:15.758
- What?

59:15.760 --> 59:16.418
- I'm trying to -

59:16.420 --> 59:17.386
- Oh.

59:18.455 --> 59:20.356
- Yeah, no,

59:20.358 --> 59:21.896
thanks for cleaning all that
barf in the kids section.

59:21.898 --> 59:22.897
I'm sure you have
better things to do

59:22.899 --> 59:24.426
on your Saturday night.

59:25.028 --> 59:28.606
Oh, fuck this fucking place.

59:29.939 --> 59:31.972
- Hey, when you said
you hated movies,

59:32.843 --> 59:34.568
were you just kidding?

59:34.570 --> 59:37.010
- No, no, I really hate movies.

59:38.607 --> 59:40.112
- Then why do you work here?

59:42.578 --> 59:47.724
- Okay, so I think
that I lied to you.

59:54.865 --> 59:56.964
I didn't really
drop out of school

59:56.966 --> 01:00:00.429
because my roommate
committed suicide.

01:00:00.431 --> 01:00:03.674
I actually don't have any
first-hand experience with that.

01:00:05.304 --> 01:00:06.908
I don't know why I said that.

01:00:06.910 --> 01:00:08.074
I'm really sorry.

01:00:08.076 --> 01:00:09.878
Like, I hope you can forgive me.

01:00:14.346 --> 01:00:16.115
- Yeah, yeah, no, I forgive you.

01:00:16.117 --> 01:00:18.150
Oh my god, thank god.
- Totally.

01:00:20.121 --> 01:00:21.989
- I felt like such
a piece of shit.

01:00:23.487 --> 01:00:24.453
(sighing) Okay.

01:00:25.731 --> 01:00:27.225
Thanks.

01:00:27.227 --> 01:00:28.765
Oh, if it makes you
feel any better,

01:00:28.767 --> 01:00:32.703
I did really drop out
of school when I was 19.

01:00:34.069 --> 01:00:36.806
I moved to LA for this
movie that I was in.

01:00:36.808 --> 01:00:38.203
- What movie were you in?

01:00:39.272 --> 01:00:40.810
- "The Running Mate?"

01:00:40.812 --> 01:00:42.339
- Is that um,

01:00:42.341 --> 01:00:43.912
it's like a '90s teen comedy

01:00:43.914 --> 01:00:45.947
where a cool guy runs
for class president?

01:00:45.949 --> 01:00:47.784
- Like on a dare

01:00:47.786 --> 01:00:49.313
and then he falls in love
with his running mate.

01:00:49.315 --> 01:00:50.853
- Oh, and Jon Lovitz is
the school principal.

01:00:50.855 --> 01:00:52.316
Alana, did you get
to meet Jon Lovitz?

01:00:53.649 --> 01:00:55.990
- Lawrence, I'm not
gonna talk about this

01:00:55.992 --> 01:00:57.761
unless you're
really gonna listen.

01:00:59.292 --> 01:01:00.830
Like, movies are not fun.

01:01:00.832 --> 01:01:03.228
There's a lot that they
don't tell you about.

01:01:04.528 --> 01:01:05.494
Okay.

01:01:06.871 --> 01:01:10.532
So, this is actually
kind of a long story.

01:01:12.272 --> 01:01:14.371
(sighing)

01:01:14.373 --> 01:01:15.537
Oh, I didn't.

01:01:15.539 --> 01:01:16.912
No, I didn't mean you had to.

01:01:19.642 --> 01:01:21.180
Okay.

01:01:21.182 --> 01:01:23.545
I always knew that I was
meant to be in movies.

01:01:24.823 --> 01:01:27.021
Now, I know that that's stupid,

01:01:27.023 --> 01:01:31.454
but I starred in all
the plays at Aldershot

01:01:31.456 --> 01:01:35.964
and just like
everything about acting

01:01:35.966 --> 01:01:38.802
just made me feel like
people were seeing me

01:01:38.804 --> 01:01:41.200
basically for the first time.

01:01:41.202 --> 01:01:46.337
So, my mom took me to Toronto
to try and get an agent

01:01:47.274 --> 01:01:48.845
and then one actually signed me,

01:01:48.847 --> 01:01:52.673
but she made me take
these weird head shots

01:01:52.675 --> 01:01:57.216
wearing like a tube top 'cause
she said that was my hit.

01:01:57.218 --> 01:01:59.086
- What's a hit?

01:01:59.088 --> 01:02:01.583
- A hit is like what people
see when they look at you.

01:02:01.585 --> 01:02:06.720
And I guess my hit was
vulnerable drunk slut

01:02:08.262 --> 01:02:12.594
'cause they just kept
sending me out for roles

01:02:12.596 --> 01:02:17.731
like "Girl at Keg Party" or
"Sorority Babe Number Two,"

01:02:18.701 --> 01:02:19.876
like roles that I wouldn't get

01:02:19.878 --> 01:02:22.670
because obviously I wouldn't

01:02:22.672 --> 01:02:25.475
until I did in
"The Running Mate."

01:02:26.819 --> 01:02:29.985
Like, getting this role
was a really big deal.

01:02:29.987 --> 01:02:31.448
Like Jonah, he was the director.

01:02:31.450 --> 01:02:32.713
He fought for me.

01:02:32.715 --> 01:02:35.353
And so I was in LA,

01:02:35.355 --> 01:02:38.026
and I was like living on my own,

01:02:38.028 --> 01:02:42.756
and I was lonely.

01:02:46.267 --> 01:02:48.597
But Jonah, he like
took pity on me and,

01:02:52.911 --> 01:02:54.669
oh, you remind me of him.

01:02:56.706 --> 01:02:58.607
He went to Tisch
School of the Arts.

01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:02.446
Me and Jonah, we
would drive around,

01:03:02.448 --> 01:03:04.019
and we would go for tacos,

01:03:04.021 --> 01:03:06.153
and we would like,
talk and watch movies.

01:03:06.155 --> 01:03:11.290
And then there was this producer

01:03:12.260 --> 01:03:13.820
who started hanging around.

01:03:13.822 --> 01:03:15.591
- Isn't that what producers do?

01:03:15.593 --> 01:03:18.000
- Yeah, but this producer
was like a creep.

01:03:18.002 --> 01:03:19.595
Like if I had a wardrobe test,

01:03:19.597 --> 01:03:21.828
he would just like stand
behind me the whole time

01:03:21.830 --> 01:03:22.829
staring at my ass.

01:03:22.831 --> 01:03:24.402
Like, he, I don't know,

01:03:24.404 --> 01:03:25.766
was obsessed with
my panty lines.

01:03:25.768 --> 01:03:28.241
And then all of a sudden,

01:03:28.243 --> 01:03:31.706
there was like this concern
about my "experience level"

01:03:31.708 --> 01:03:35.644
and he just kept inviting
me to dinners to discuss it.

01:03:35.646 --> 01:03:37.481
But these dinners were
always really late

01:03:37.483 --> 01:03:39.417
in his hotel room,

01:03:39.419 --> 01:03:42.717
but Jonah, he kept pushing me
to go over and over and over.

01:03:43.522 --> 01:03:44.686
So then I did, I did,

01:03:44.688 --> 01:03:48.459
I went to his hotel and I, yeah,

01:03:48.461 --> 01:03:49.823
I went into his room,

01:03:49.825 --> 01:03:52.331
but the lights were all off.

01:03:52.333 --> 01:03:54.465
And he was just like,
sitting there in the dark,

01:03:54.467 --> 01:03:58.909
so now it's just like, me
and him in the dark and,

01:04:06.017 --> 01:04:08.248
and I, I can't get him off me.

01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:21.426
So,

01:04:29.337 --> 01:04:32.008
the movie gets delayed
and then they like,

01:04:32.010 --> 01:04:36.276
Jonah replaces me with
this girl on the WB.

01:04:36.278 --> 01:04:41.182
And yeah, I like spend the
next six years living in LA,

01:04:41.184 --> 01:04:43.151
and I don't book a
single other thing

01:04:43.153 --> 01:04:44.878
except for this one
like, dumb pilot

01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:47.419
until I just rack
up so much debt

01:04:47.421 --> 01:04:49.487
that I have to move
back in with my parents

01:04:49.489 --> 01:04:51.027
and I start working here.

01:04:51.029 --> 01:04:51.962
So,

01:04:56.034 --> 01:04:59.002
yeah, I hate movies.

01:05:05.868 --> 01:05:07.373
- Why did you tell me this?

01:05:07.375 --> 01:05:09.408
- 'Cause I thought
that you would wanna,

01:05:09.410 --> 01:05:10.948
like, you would wanna know.

01:05:15.878 --> 01:05:16.811
I don't know.

01:05:18.419 --> 01:05:20.056
Sorry, sorry, I guess.

01:05:21.587 --> 01:05:22.784
I don't know.

01:05:24.458 --> 01:05:26.161
- [Lawrence] Am I like the
only person you've told?

01:05:26.163 --> 01:05:27.129
- What?

01:05:27.956 --> 01:05:29.329
Aside from my mom,

01:05:29.331 --> 01:05:31.199
yeah, yeah, you are.

01:05:33.962 --> 01:05:34.928
- God.

01:05:39.473 --> 01:05:44.410
- Like, why didn't
you just tell someone?

01:05:44.412 --> 01:05:46.577
You know, like if
you told the police,

01:05:46.579 --> 01:05:48.810
I bet that guy would
be in jail right now.

01:05:49.780 --> 01:05:51.582
- Are you like a fucking idiot?

01:05:54.158 --> 01:05:57.456
Sometimes, I like
can't believe my job

01:05:57.458 --> 01:05:59.590
is to make you feel
good about yourself,

01:05:59.592 --> 01:06:01.460
like to make you feel great

01:06:01.462 --> 01:06:03.363
about your like
incredible future

01:06:03.365 --> 01:06:05.893
when I was actually
talented and good.

01:06:05.895 --> 01:06:11.008
And like, the saddest part is
I really want your approval.

01:06:12.902 --> 01:06:14.770
I really want you
to think I'm cool

01:06:14.772 --> 01:06:17.773
and that is the saddest
thing that I can imagine.

01:06:17.775 --> 01:06:19.346
- I think you're so cool, Alana.

01:06:19.348 --> 01:06:20.743
I really do.

01:06:31.162 --> 01:06:36.264
(water splashing)
(vehicles whooshing)

01:06:43.174 --> 01:06:44.998
- [Announcer Over PA System]
Attention, Aldershot.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.242
If Ashley McIsaac could
come to the office,

01:06:47.244 --> 01:06:49.508
it is time to take your Ritalin.

01:06:49.510 --> 01:06:50.443
Thank you.

01:06:54.119 --> 01:06:55.382
- Hey, man.

01:06:55.384 --> 01:06:56.878
How the hell are you?

01:06:56.880 --> 01:06:57.912
- I'm good.

01:06:58.816 --> 01:07:00.255
How the hell are you?

01:07:00.257 --> 01:07:01.553
- Oh, yeah, dude.

01:07:01.555 --> 01:07:03.489
I got into Carleton.

01:07:03.491 --> 01:07:06.195
I mean like obviously, I'm
holding out for NYU still,

01:07:06.197 --> 01:07:07.823
but yeah, it's crazy.

01:07:07.825 --> 01:07:10.958
They wanna gimme like
a $10,000 scholarship.

01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:11.860
- That's amazing, man.

01:07:11.862 --> 01:07:13.235
Good for you.

01:07:14.205 --> 01:07:15.699
- Well, are you and Lauren P.

01:07:15.701 --> 01:07:17.305
still working on
the Year End Video,

01:07:17.307 --> 01:07:18.438
going to Wendy's,
getting frosties?

01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:20.737
- What do you want, Lawrence?

01:07:23.148 --> 01:07:24.213
- Well, I was just,

01:07:25.909 --> 01:07:27.678
I was just thinking about how
we haven't had Reject's Night

01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:29.845
in like a really
long time, you know?

01:07:29.847 --> 01:07:33.618
Probably because I've been
working so much and yeah, yeah,

01:07:33.620 --> 01:07:37.985
I was just thinking about
how like maybe this Saturday,

01:07:37.987 --> 01:07:40.020
we could have a Reject's
Night again, you know?

01:07:40.022 --> 01:07:41.824
Like I would have to
switch my shift at work,

01:07:41.826 --> 01:07:43.298
but then you'd be able
to pick me up at Sequels

01:07:43.300 --> 01:07:45.498
at like 10 and we
could still make SNL.

01:07:46.897 --> 01:07:48.930
- Yeah, that's totally cool.

01:07:48.932 --> 01:07:51.207
I can ask my dad to like let
me borrow the car or something.

01:07:51.209 --> 01:07:53.539
- Yeah, dude, awesome.
- Cool.

01:07:53.541 --> 01:07:55.178
Oh man, we should do the thing.

01:07:56.544 --> 01:07:57.774
- Nah, I don't want
to do that right now.

01:07:57.776 --> 01:07:58.940
- Oh, come on, Matt.

01:07:58.942 --> 01:08:00.678
Just do the thing with me, dude.

01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:02.075
- I don't want to--
- Come on, just do the thing!

01:08:02.077 --> 01:08:02.911
It takes like 20
seconds to do the thing!

01:08:02.913 --> 01:08:04.616
Do the thing.

01:08:04.618 --> 01:08:05.749
- Okay.

01:08:05.751 --> 01:08:07.014
- Okay.

01:08:07.016 --> 01:08:08.191
Okay.

01:08:08.193 --> 01:08:10.292
I am casually eating a hot dog

01:08:10.294 --> 01:08:12.261
in like a stylish leather jacket

01:08:12.263 --> 01:08:14.230
and I'm very bashful, okay?

01:08:14.232 --> 01:08:15.165
What about you?

01:08:16.498 --> 01:08:17.596
- I'm looking at the
Empire State Building.

01:08:17.598 --> 01:08:18.696
- Okay, frame me up.

01:08:20.370 --> 01:08:23.503
- It's Saturday Night Live
with Lawrence Kweller.

01:08:27.179 --> 01:08:29.674
- And Matt Macarchuck!

01:08:31.447 --> 01:08:33.810
(laughing)

01:08:35.550 --> 01:08:36.681
- [Sergeant] Now, you've gotta
be the ugliest son of a bitch

01:08:36.683 --> 01:08:37.979
this world has ever seen!

01:08:37.981 --> 01:08:39.145
Who in the hell are you?

01:08:39.147 --> 01:08:40.751
Are you an abomination of God?

01:08:40.753 --> 01:08:42.291
- [Soldier] Sir, yes, sir!

01:08:42.293 --> 01:08:45.118
(Lawrence laughing)
(faint movie chatter)

01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:46.295
[Sergeant] Are
you ugly, Private?

01:08:46.297 --> 01:08:48.121
- [Soldier] Sir, yes, sir!

01:08:48.123 --> 01:08:49.694
- [Sergeant] Does your mama
think you're a mistake, Private?

01:08:49.696 --> 01:08:51.498
- [Soldier] Sir, yes, sir!

01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:52.994
- [Sergeant] Drop to
your knees and give me 20

01:08:52.996 --> 01:08:54.930
before I puke my guts out.
- Sir!

01:08:54.932 --> 01:08:57.537
- We're closed, go home.

01:09:02.247 --> 01:09:03.477
Oh, you're still here?

01:09:03.479 --> 01:09:05.105
You begged me to
take your shift.

01:09:05.107 --> 01:09:06.975
- Yeah,

01:09:06.977 --> 01:09:08.141
'cause me and my friend Matt
are watching SNL tonight.

01:09:08.143 --> 01:09:09.010
He's coming to pick me up.

01:09:10.849 --> 01:09:12.519
- Dude, it's midnight.

01:09:15.788 --> 01:09:17.293
What's his last name?

01:09:17.295 --> 01:09:18.921
You want me to put a
late fee on his account?

01:09:18.923 --> 01:09:20.230
- It's Macarchuck.

01:09:21.629 --> 01:09:23.398
It'd be under his
dad's name, Rick.

01:09:25.732 --> 01:09:28.568
Okay, don't actually
do that, but -

01:09:28.570 --> 01:09:30.570
I do wanna see what
movies he rented.

01:09:39.383 --> 01:09:40.382
That doesn't make any sense.

01:09:40.384 --> 01:09:41.581
This is his home branch.

01:09:43.354 --> 01:09:44.485
Why would he switch?

01:09:45.950 --> 01:09:49.215
- Oh shit, shit, shit, shit.

01:09:49.217 --> 01:09:50.854
Do you want a ride home?

01:09:52.561 --> 01:09:54.330
- No, no, I can't.

01:09:54.332 --> 01:09:56.090
I can't go home
tonight actually.

01:09:59.997 --> 01:10:01.832
Do you think I could
just sleep in the store?

01:10:01.834 --> 01:10:02.767
- What?

01:10:07.873 --> 01:10:09.708
Yo, that's gonna kill your neck.

01:10:09.710 --> 01:10:12.007
- No, it won't.

01:10:12.009 --> 01:10:13.580
- Okay.

01:10:13.582 --> 01:10:15.241
So I can get in a lot of
shit for this Lawrence.

01:10:15.243 --> 01:10:16.814
So, hey?
- Mm-hmm?

01:10:16.816 --> 01:10:18.321
- [Brendan] Okay, so
it's really important

01:10:18.323 --> 01:10:19.850
that you remember to
enter the security code

01:10:19.852 --> 01:10:21.423
when you lock up in
the morning, okay?

01:10:21.425 --> 01:10:22.424
- Yeah.

01:10:22.426 --> 01:10:24.360
- Okay, it's 4-3-6-5.

01:10:24.362 --> 01:10:26.395
- 4-3-6-5.
- Got it.

01:10:26.397 --> 01:10:28.056
Have a good night, I guess.

01:10:28.058 --> 01:10:30.157
- 4-3-6-5.
- 4-3-6-5.

01:10:32.062 --> 01:10:35.030
(lights shutting off)

01:10:35.032 --> 01:10:40.134
(soft piano music)
(chip bag rustling)

01:11:10.738 --> 01:11:12.408
(Lawrence sighing)

01:11:12.410 --> 01:11:13.343
- Ow.

01:11:24.917 --> 01:11:30.019
(soft contemplative music)
(door slamming)

01:12:06.255 --> 01:12:07.089
(Lawrence sighing)

01:12:07.091 --> 01:12:08.024
Fuck!

01:12:17.035 --> 01:12:20.201
(Lawrence weeping)

01:12:31.379 --> 01:12:32.378
- Hey.

01:12:32.380 --> 01:12:34.721
Hey, how was Matt's?

01:12:34.723 --> 01:12:37.526
(phone ringing)
What's wrong?

01:12:37.528 --> 01:12:38.461
Hello?

01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:42.025
Hold on.

01:12:42.027 --> 01:12:43.026
Lawrence, it's Alana.

01:12:43.028 --> 01:12:44.258
Can you talk to her?

01:12:44.260 --> 01:12:45.864
- No.

01:12:45.866 --> 01:12:47.360
- Alana, I'm sorry.

01:12:47.362 --> 01:12:48.801
Lawrence can't
come to the phone.

01:12:50.299 --> 01:12:51.232
What?

01:12:53.907 --> 01:12:55.511
Oh my god.

01:12:55.513 --> 01:12:58.910
No, I did not know, no.

01:12:58.912 --> 01:13:01.418
I thought that he was at
a friend's house, yeah.

01:13:02.377 --> 01:13:03.376
Okay.

01:13:03.378 --> 01:13:04.784
Yes, of course, yes.

01:13:05.754 --> 01:13:07.886
He'll be coming down right away.

01:13:07.888 --> 01:13:08.854
Yeah.

01:13:10.726 --> 01:13:11.626
Okay, bye.

01:13:13.256 --> 01:13:15.729
Looks like your store
was robbed this morning.

01:13:15.731 --> 01:13:18.798
Something about not punching
in the security code right?

01:13:19.768 --> 01:13:21.438
You slept at Sequels last night?

01:13:24.509 --> 01:13:26.102
You have to go file
a police report.

01:13:26.104 --> 01:13:27.070
- What?!

01:13:28.744 --> 01:13:29.677
But, I didn't get into NYU.

01:13:35.278 --> 01:13:36.244
- I'm sorry.

01:13:38.380 --> 01:13:39.918
My heart is breaking for you,

01:13:43.528 --> 01:13:45.253
but you're gonna cry in the car.

01:13:53.571 --> 01:13:55.967
- Well, you get the idea.

01:13:55.969 --> 01:14:00.543
So, Alana feels like you're
not really being a team player.

01:14:00.545 --> 01:14:03.370
We got here frequently late.

01:14:03.372 --> 01:14:05.174
Apparently, you have
expressed a desire

01:14:05.176 --> 01:14:07.242
not to sell the merchandise.

01:14:07.244 --> 01:14:11.917
And there have been some reports
of emotional instability.

01:14:11.919 --> 01:14:14.414
But now she sees you on
the security cameras,

01:14:14.416 --> 01:14:16.823
sleeping overnight in the store,

01:14:16.825 --> 01:14:18.990
which is a huge security risk.

01:14:18.992 --> 01:14:20.827
And not only that,

01:14:20.829 --> 01:14:23.456
but the front door to the store
was somehow left wide open.

01:14:23.458 --> 01:14:27.130
We have now lost $5,000
worth of Sequels merchandise.

01:14:29.266 --> 01:14:31.673
- I've also done
good things too.

01:14:31.675 --> 01:14:33.499
Did Alana mention
the Staff Picks wall?

01:14:33.501 --> 01:14:35.644
- Yeah, no, the Staff
Picks wall was great,

01:14:35.646 --> 01:14:38.548
but right now, you're letting
your whole team down, okay?

01:14:38.550 --> 01:14:40.341
Especially me.

01:14:40.343 --> 01:14:41.980
- Lawrence, you have an
amazing opportunity right now.

01:14:41.982 --> 01:14:43.443
You're working for a company

01:14:43.445 --> 01:14:44.983
that's only growing
and expanding.

01:14:44.985 --> 01:14:47.315
So if you play your cards right,

01:14:47.317 --> 01:14:49.988
I could see you having a career
in the video store industry

01:14:49.990 --> 01:14:52.287
for the next 30 to 40 years.

01:14:53.631 --> 01:14:55.455
- No offense,

01:14:55.457 --> 01:14:57.666
but I think I wanna do
bigger things with my life

01:14:57.668 --> 01:14:59.228
than just work here.

01:14:59.230 --> 01:15:02.396
Like my job is walking
around a video store,

01:15:02.398 --> 01:15:03.738
making people buy things.

01:15:03.740 --> 01:15:05.872
It's kind of the stupidest job

01:15:05.874 --> 01:15:08.105
that's ever existed
to be honest.

01:15:08.107 --> 01:15:11.471
And you want me to do it
for the next 30 to 40 years?

01:15:11.473 --> 01:15:14.243
Like, don't you think I'm
more capable than that?

01:15:15.818 --> 01:15:17.345
- Why are you being a dick?

01:15:17.347 --> 01:15:19.215
- Well, it's not the
language I would use.

01:15:19.217 --> 01:15:21.118
- Well, no, Lawrence needs to
know when he's being a dick.

01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:22.790
Just because you go to
university doesn't mean

01:15:22.792 --> 01:15:24.484
like everything's
gonna turn out great.

01:15:24.486 --> 01:15:26.827
People work at
Sequels to do things

01:15:26.829 --> 01:15:30.028
like earn a living and survive.

01:15:30.030 --> 01:15:31.557
- Maybe they also do it

01:15:31.559 --> 01:15:33.394
when they've had a
traumatic experience

01:15:33.396 --> 01:15:35.902
and they're emotionally
devastated now or whatever.

01:15:35.904 --> 01:15:37.739
- Wow, really?

01:15:38.907 --> 01:15:40.401
Fuck you, motherfucker!

01:15:40.403 --> 01:15:42.337
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:15:42.339 --> 01:15:44.174
- I don't understand why I'm
being called a motherfucker.

01:15:44.176 --> 01:15:45.681
- That's not really the way
to speak to an employee.

01:15:45.683 --> 01:15:47.540
- Well, maybe me and
Owen are like pissed off

01:15:47.542 --> 01:15:49.575
because of your huge sense
of fucking entitlement?!

01:15:49.577 --> 01:15:51.687
Do you know what I would
give to be a 17-year-old boy

01:15:51.689 --> 01:15:54.481
just quietly sitting in the
corner watching my DVDs,

01:15:54.483 --> 01:15:56.318
knowing I'm gonna inherit
the whole fucking earth

01:15:56.320 --> 01:15:58.155
'cause literally the whole
fucking world is made

01:15:58.157 --> 01:15:59.860
for shitty little nerds like me.

01:15:59.862 --> 01:16:01.389
And I bet you will go to NYU

01:16:01.391 --> 01:16:02.929
and just go on to
treat so many women

01:16:02.931 --> 01:16:05.734
like complete and utter
garbage because, what?

01:16:05.736 --> 01:16:07.329
Your biggest emotional
wound is like,

01:16:07.331 --> 01:16:08.869
no one wanted to watch
Stanley Kubrick movies

01:16:08.871 --> 01:16:10.398
with you in high school?

01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:12.400
- Well, no, no, I
didn't get into NYU.

01:16:12.402 --> 01:16:13.907
And if you're forgetting,

01:16:13.909 --> 01:16:16.041
my dad kind of like
killed himself.

01:16:17.374 --> 01:16:19.407
Owen, I'm not sure
if you realize this,

01:16:19.409 --> 01:16:21.343
but my father, four years ago,

01:16:21.345 --> 01:16:23.345
he hung himself
in our garage, so.

01:16:23.347 --> 01:16:25.149
- On behalf of his
Sequels corporation,

01:16:25.151 --> 01:16:26.414
I'd like to extend my
deepest condolences to you

01:16:26.416 --> 01:16:27.580
and your family.
- No, Owen, no.

01:16:27.582 --> 01:16:29.054
He does this like all the time.

01:16:29.056 --> 01:16:30.517
It's like his
secret little trick

01:16:30.519 --> 01:16:31.892
to make people
feel sorry for him.

01:16:31.894 --> 01:16:33.388
You are very
privileged, Lawrence!

01:16:33.390 --> 01:16:35.258
- I don't feel privileged.

01:16:35.260 --> 01:16:36.699
I don't even understand
what that means.

01:16:36.701 --> 01:16:37.832
Owen, do you understand
what that means?

01:16:37.834 --> 01:16:39.361
- You can't say that to me!

01:16:39.363 --> 01:16:41.330
It makes me wanna stab
you in the throat!

01:16:41.332 --> 01:16:44.069
- Okay, so this isn't
being productive right now.

01:16:45.809 --> 01:16:47.303
To answer your question,

01:16:47.305 --> 01:16:48.469
I think it's a sort
of a structural,

01:16:48.471 --> 01:16:50.009
symbolic kind of privilege.

01:16:50.011 --> 01:16:51.439
- Oh my god, this
is not working.

01:16:51.441 --> 01:16:53.309
This is like, crazy.

01:16:53.311 --> 01:16:54.475
- But Lawrence, I do want
to apologize for the way

01:16:54.477 --> 01:16:55.476
that you were just spoken to.

01:16:55.478 --> 01:16:56.642
It's not appropriate.

01:16:56.644 --> 01:16:58.149
We will have a chat about that.

01:16:58.151 --> 01:16:59.645
But Alana and I were
chatting earlier

01:16:59.647 --> 01:17:01.152
and we think it's appropriate

01:17:01.154 --> 01:17:02.615
to give you a three
week probation.

01:17:02.617 --> 01:17:03.957
- Wait, so I'm fired?

01:17:03.959 --> 01:17:05.453
- No, no.

01:17:05.455 --> 01:17:07.092
Brendan, your shift
leader, was responsible.

01:17:07.094 --> 01:17:09.325
We feel he should
be the one to go.

01:17:09.327 --> 01:17:11.459
But speaking of privileges,

01:17:11.461 --> 01:17:13.263
of course,

01:17:13.265 --> 01:17:15.133
you will not have your
Sequels employee privileges

01:17:15.135 --> 01:17:16.970
during your probationary time.

01:17:16.972 --> 01:17:18.400
- Wait, wait, but what
about "Punch Drunk Love?"

01:17:18.402 --> 01:17:20.138
The DVD is coming out very soon

01:17:20.140 --> 01:17:22.910
and I need my Sequels
discount to be able to buy it.

01:17:22.912 --> 01:17:25.880
- You should have
thought of your precious
Adam Sandler before -

01:17:27.642 --> 01:17:29.818
Okay, Owen,

01:17:29.820 --> 01:17:31.479
what if I like just
don't want Lawrence

01:17:31.481 --> 01:17:32.645
to work here anymore either?

01:17:32.647 --> 01:17:34.218
Can we just fire him right now?

01:17:34.990 --> 01:17:36.858
- Well, no.

01:17:36.860 --> 01:17:38.024
I mean, there's a tiered
conflict resolution model.

01:17:38.026 --> 01:17:39.190
- No, no, no, no, you can't.

01:17:39.192 --> 01:17:40.994
I'm sorry, you can't, Alana.

01:17:40.996 --> 01:17:43.799
You can't fire me because
I think I love you.

01:17:45.165 --> 01:17:46.967
You're my best friend.

01:17:46.969 --> 01:17:48.364
- No, no, no, no.

01:17:48.366 --> 01:17:50.630
You are a narcissist, Lawrence.

01:17:55.637 --> 01:17:58.979
(seagulls cawing)

01:17:58.981 --> 01:18:01.674
(horn blaring)

01:18:04.679 --> 01:18:06.316
(knocking on window)
- It's open.

01:18:14.865 --> 01:18:15.831
- Hey.

01:18:19.100 --> 01:18:20.693
So yeah, it was just like

01:18:20.695 --> 01:18:22.398
kind of a
misunderstanding actually,

01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:24.169
just a bit of a
miscommunication.

01:18:24.908 --> 01:18:26.369
- Okay.
- Yes.

01:18:26.371 --> 01:18:27.601
- Put your seatbelt on.

01:18:31.981 --> 01:18:32.815
Oh my god.

01:18:32.817 --> 01:18:33.882
- What, what?

01:18:33.884 --> 01:18:35.147
- [Terri] What is that?

01:18:35.149 --> 01:18:36.247
Are you picking your head again?

01:18:36.249 --> 01:18:37.215
- No.

01:18:38.548 --> 01:18:39.822
Don't be mad.

01:18:41.122 --> 01:18:43.056
It just helps me feel
better sometimes.

01:18:45.995 --> 01:18:46.928
I got fired.

01:18:49.526 --> 01:18:54.232
- It just never ends with you.

01:18:54.234 --> 01:18:57.268
(clippers buzzing)

01:19:05.817 --> 01:19:08.785
Oh my god, I should
be a hairstylist.

01:19:10.184 --> 01:19:11.711
- Okay.

01:19:11.713 --> 01:19:13.955
Now, before we screen
the Year End Video,

01:19:13.957 --> 01:19:16.859
would our filmmakers like to
come and talk about their work?

01:19:16.861 --> 01:19:17.794
Yeah? Okay.

01:19:19.028 --> 01:19:22.293
(students chattering)

01:19:25.100 --> 01:19:27.430
- Hi, Aldershot.

01:19:27.432 --> 01:19:28.970
My name is Lauren Phillips

01:19:28.972 --> 01:19:31.071
and I'm the director
of the Year End Video.

01:19:31.073 --> 01:19:32.072
(student cheering)

01:19:32.074 --> 01:19:33.568
Thank you, Mr. Olenick,

01:19:33.570 --> 01:19:36.604
and to my producer,
Matt Macarchuck.

01:19:36.606 --> 01:19:38.474
and to all of you guys

01:19:38.476 --> 01:19:40.707
for like putting up with
all the filming and stuff.

01:19:40.709 --> 01:19:43.545
We will be doing a Q&A in
the foyer after the assembly.

01:19:43.547 --> 01:19:47.318
And I shot this on 16-mm film.

01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:48.957
Okay, thanks.

01:19:48.959 --> 01:19:50.156
- Okay, okay!

01:19:51.291 --> 01:19:53.291
(students applauding)

01:19:53.293 --> 01:19:55.755
Are we ready for this movie?

01:19:57.099 --> 01:19:59.759
All right, lights,
curtain, action!

01:20:02.797 --> 01:20:05.105
- [Matt] That was a great
speech. - [Lauren P.] Thank you.

01:20:05.107 --> 01:20:06.469
- [Matt] Dude, don't be nervous.

01:20:06.471 --> 01:20:07.635
Everyone's gonna love it.

01:20:07.637 --> 01:20:09.670
- [Lauren] I'm not nervous.

01:20:11.443 --> 01:20:16.545
(screen descending)
(students chattering)

01:20:18.813 --> 01:20:23.959
(gentle orchestral music)
(students chattering)

01:21:46.010 --> 01:21:48.208
- I just bought a new
film camera and all that,

01:21:48.210 --> 01:21:50.045
so I'm excited.

01:21:50.047 --> 01:21:51.046
What about you guys?

01:21:51.048 --> 01:21:51.871
Where are you headed to?

01:21:51.873 --> 01:21:53.048
- Hey, man.

01:21:53.050 --> 01:21:54.874
Are you here for our Q&A?

01:21:55.844 --> 01:21:58.614
- I mean, I got some Q's.

01:21:58.616 --> 01:22:00.286
- You don't wanna hear our A's?

01:22:01.586 --> 01:22:03.751
- The Year End Video
was really cool.

01:22:03.753 --> 01:22:07.557
It um, moved me emotionally,

01:22:07.559 --> 01:22:09.196
which I think is the
highest compliment

01:22:09.198 --> 01:22:10.791
you could give to a filmmaker.

01:22:11.860 --> 01:22:13.464
- Well, thank you, Lawrence.

01:22:13.466 --> 01:22:14.597
That was very sweet.

01:22:15.930 --> 01:22:18.436
- I do have a Q actually.

01:22:23.311 --> 01:22:24.904
Why aren't we friends anymore?

01:22:24.906 --> 01:22:26.015
- Ooh, okay.

01:22:28.481 --> 01:22:30.844
Let's take this outside.
- Sorry.

01:22:36.423 --> 01:22:39.160
- I think it just got
too hard, you know?

01:22:39.162 --> 01:22:42.361
Like, you kind of
were just always

01:22:42.363 --> 01:22:43.824
acting like you were
better than me, you know?

01:22:43.826 --> 01:22:45.661
You said I was a placeholder,

01:22:45.663 --> 01:22:47.234
and then you said that
fucked up thing to Lauren,

01:22:47.236 --> 01:22:49.929
and then my grandpa
died and stuff,

01:22:49.931 --> 01:22:52.998
so I just didn't really
want to deal with you.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.275
- Wait, your grandpa died?

01:22:59.347 --> 01:23:01.314
Why didn't you tell me?

01:23:01.316 --> 01:23:03.184
- I think probably 'cause
it was easier than knowing

01:23:03.186 --> 01:23:05.010
that if I told you,

01:23:05.012 --> 01:23:07.056
you probably wouldn't
have given a shit anyways.

01:23:07.058 --> 01:23:09.487
So, I don't know.

01:23:09.489 --> 01:23:13.656
- I am so sorry,
Matt, for everything.

01:23:13.658 --> 01:23:14.525
- Dude.

01:23:14.527 --> 01:23:15.790
- No.

01:23:15.792 --> 01:23:16.725
Like...

01:23:18.102 --> 01:23:21.796
Well, will you still
sign my yearbook?

01:23:23.305 --> 01:23:24.238
- Yeah.

01:23:29.212 --> 01:23:30.706
- They gave you "nicest eyes."

01:23:32.182 --> 01:23:33.511
You do have very nice eyes.

01:23:33.513 --> 01:23:34.644
- Shut the fuck up.

01:23:34.646 --> 01:23:36.514
- I'm sorry.

01:23:36.516 --> 01:23:37.911
I wish I appreciated them
more when I had the chance.

01:23:39.552 --> 01:23:41.981
- You know, I'm gonna
move to Toronto next year

01:23:41.983 --> 01:23:43.290
when Lauren goes to Ryerson.

01:23:43.292 --> 01:23:45.050
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:23:45.052 --> 01:23:46.623
I was thinking about
taking some improv classes

01:23:46.625 --> 01:23:48.493
at Second City.

01:23:48.495 --> 01:23:50.759
- Dude, that's where like
a bunch of SNL people went.

01:23:50.761 --> 01:23:51.760
That's awesome.

01:23:53.401 --> 01:23:55.071
- You still moving to New York?

01:23:55.865 --> 01:23:57.535
- Ottawa.

01:23:57.537 --> 01:23:59.207
I'm gonna go to Carleton.

01:24:05.743 --> 01:24:07.545
Dude, you should come visit me.

01:24:07.547 --> 01:24:10.042
I think if we go to
Hull, we could get drunk.

01:24:10.044 --> 01:24:11.879
The drinking age
there is only 18.

01:24:11.881 --> 01:24:14.552
We could also like maybe
take the train to Montreal,

01:24:14.554 --> 01:24:16.048
go see the Parliament Buildings.

01:24:16.050 --> 01:24:18.721
We could go to the
National Art Gallery,

01:24:19.691 --> 01:24:21.086
give paintings the finger.

01:24:21.088 --> 01:24:22.054
- Here you go.

01:24:25.763 --> 01:24:27.202
See ya Lawrence.

01:24:28.700 --> 01:24:29.864
- Hey, Matt?

01:24:32.374 --> 01:24:34.242
I'm just gonna say something

01:24:34.244 --> 01:24:37.146
and you don't have to say it
back if you don't want to,

01:24:38.842 --> 01:24:43.075
but um, I love you and I
miss you like, every day.

01:24:50.524 --> 01:24:51.457
- Yeah.

01:24:53.087 --> 01:24:54.493
I'll see you around, okay?

01:24:59.126 --> 01:25:00.092
- Okay.

01:25:09.642 --> 01:25:11.103
- [Matt] Hey, Lawrence.

01:25:11.105 --> 01:25:13.105
I hope you have a
great time at Carleton.

01:25:13.107 --> 01:25:15.074
Thanks for making
me laugh a lot.

01:25:15.076 --> 01:25:17.076
We'll always have
Reject's Night.

01:25:17.078 --> 01:25:18.418
Peace out!

01:25:18.420 --> 01:25:20.915
Your friend, Matt Macarchuck.

01:25:37.505 --> 01:25:40.033
- I'll meet you at the front.

01:25:55.017 --> 01:25:56.852
- Do you think I
could just like,

01:25:56.854 --> 01:25:58.854
get my discount on
this one last time?

01:25:59.956 --> 01:26:00.889
- Um, no.

01:26:05.159 --> 01:26:06.125
There you go.

01:26:07.469 --> 01:26:08.402
Thank you.

01:26:10.670 --> 01:26:12.538
- I like your earrings.

01:26:12.540 --> 01:26:13.539
- Thanks.

01:26:13.541 --> 01:26:14.903
They are Le Chateau.

01:26:23.353 --> 01:26:24.286
- Bye for now.

01:26:25.586 --> 01:26:26.717
- See you, Lawrence.

01:26:32.956 --> 01:26:35.528
- Um, more please.
- More?

01:26:37.367 --> 01:26:38.531
Okay?

01:26:38.533 --> 01:26:39.598
- One more.
- Really? Okay.

01:26:41.195 --> 01:26:42.370
- [Lawrence] That's
great, thank you so much.

01:26:42.372 --> 01:26:43.239
- All right.
- Yeah.

01:26:55.209 --> 01:26:57.385
- [Server] I can
help you here, ma'am.

01:26:57.387 --> 01:26:58.881
- Hi.

01:26:58.883 --> 01:27:00.817
- [Server] Yup,
what would you like?

01:27:00.819 --> 01:27:04.183
- So I'll order a turkey sub,
whole wheat bread, no cheese.

01:27:05.252 --> 01:27:08.957
("I Like Movies" main theme)

01:27:25.679 --> 01:27:26.612
Hey.

01:27:27.450 --> 01:27:28.416
Nice hair.

01:27:30.882 --> 01:27:32.145
Can I sit with you?

01:27:36.118 --> 01:27:37.084
- Sure.

01:27:47.965 --> 01:27:50.669
- Oh hey, you're going to
university soon, right?

01:27:53.036 --> 01:27:55.069
So I should maybe
give you some tips,

01:27:55.071 --> 01:27:57.379
college tips.

01:27:59.075 --> 01:28:00.910
Yeah, any degree you get is
like basically meaningless

01:28:00.912 --> 01:28:02.846
so you should just take courses
that actually interest you.

01:28:02.848 --> 01:28:05.585
Like, experiment, you know?

01:28:05.587 --> 01:28:07.455
And not just with school

01:28:07.457 --> 01:28:09.314
'cause I actually wish that
I had more sex in college.

01:28:09.316 --> 01:28:10.216
- Geez.

01:28:10.218 --> 01:28:12.053
- Yeah.

01:28:12.055 --> 01:28:15.562
And yeah, if you put tinfoil
over the smoke detector,

01:28:15.564 --> 01:28:18.125
you can actually smoke
weed in your dorm.

01:28:19.799 --> 01:28:22.294
- How do you get people
to like you in university?

01:28:26.575 --> 01:28:28.806
- Ask them questions
about their interests

01:28:30.139 --> 01:28:31.677
and really listen
when they talk.

01:28:31.679 --> 01:28:33.272
Not just because you're
waiting to speak,

01:28:33.274 --> 01:28:35.307
but like really listen
to what they're saying

01:28:35.309 --> 01:28:38.948
so you can sort of see where
the conversation takes you.

01:28:42.657 --> 01:28:44.492
I mean,

01:28:44.494 --> 01:28:46.120
I think people are really
gonna like you in university.

01:28:46.122 --> 01:28:49.354
I know that maybe they
didn't in high school,

01:28:49.356 --> 01:28:54.502
but I think you have a real
college type of personality.

01:28:57.298 --> 01:29:00.673
Yeah, things are like gonna
be really good for you there.

01:29:00.675 --> 01:29:02.235
- Well, what about you?

01:29:02.237 --> 01:29:03.445
- What about me?

01:29:03.447 --> 01:29:05.579
- Like, are you gonna be okay?

01:29:07.275 --> 01:29:08.208
- Yeah.

01:29:09.552 --> 01:29:11.849
Yeah, I don't work
at Sequels anymore.

01:29:14.117 --> 01:29:17.987
I enrolled in an acting class.

01:29:17.989 --> 01:29:19.351
- Oh.

01:29:19.353 --> 01:29:20.528
- Yeah.

01:29:20.530 --> 01:29:23.091
And I am seeing a therapist.

01:29:24.061 --> 01:29:25.401
- Well, how's all that been?

01:29:27.504 --> 01:29:29.031
- Yeah, pretty good I think.

01:29:30.232 --> 01:29:31.198
- Cool.

01:29:32.905 --> 01:29:36.445
Alana, can I ask you like
a super personal question?

01:29:38.372 --> 01:29:39.338
- Mm-hmm?

01:29:40.814 --> 01:29:42.682
- What's your
favorite movie, man?

01:29:42.684 --> 01:29:44.277
- Oh my god.
- You never told me.

01:29:45.412 --> 01:29:46.752
- Oh my god, Lawrence.

01:29:48.415 --> 01:29:51.724
Okay, are you like really
ready to hear the answer now?

01:29:51.726 --> 01:29:53.253
- I think so, yeah.

01:29:53.255 --> 01:29:55.057
- 'Cause it's not a
Stanley Kubrick movie.

01:29:55.059 --> 01:29:56.828
- I have come to accept that.
- Okay.

01:29:56.830 --> 01:29:58.324
- I just,

01:29:58.326 --> 01:30:00.029
I want to know what
kind of movies you like.

01:30:00.031 --> 01:30:00.964
- Ooh.

01:30:06.675 --> 01:30:08.642
"Steel Magnolias."

01:30:10.239 --> 01:30:13.779
- Oh, yeah, I haven't
seen that actually.

01:30:13.781 --> 01:30:15.341
- Oh my god.

01:30:15.343 --> 01:30:17.211
Lawrence, you haven't
seen "Steel Magnolias?"

01:30:17.213 --> 01:30:18.047
- No, no.

01:30:18.049 --> 01:30:19.554
- What?

01:30:19.556 --> 01:30:21.116
This is like the best
movie of all time.

01:30:21.118 --> 01:30:22.722
- What do you like
so much about it?

01:30:22.724 --> 01:30:24.493
- Okay, for starters,
it has the best cast.

01:30:24.495 --> 01:30:28.090
Like Julia Roberts, Sally
Field, Dolly Parton,

01:30:28.092 --> 01:30:30.565
and Shirley MacLaine
are all in this movie

01:30:30.567 --> 01:30:35.196
and they all have like these
amazing Southern accents.

01:30:35.198 --> 01:30:36.604
(laughing)

01:30:36.606 --> 01:30:38.430
And then at the
beginning of the movie,

01:30:38.432 --> 01:30:40.971
Julia Roberts is like
this beautiful bride to be

01:30:40.973 --> 01:30:42.434
with chronic diabetes.

01:30:42.436 --> 01:30:44.777
And like I don't
wanna spoil anything,

01:30:44.779 --> 01:30:48.275
but like she could
maybe die at the end.

01:30:48.277 --> 01:30:49.276
- Oh no.

01:30:49.278 --> 01:30:50.442
- It breaks your heart.

01:30:50.444 --> 01:30:51.619
You have to see this movie.

01:30:51.621 --> 01:30:52.785
- What year did it come out?

01:30:52.787 --> 01:30:54.446
- Oh, who the fuck knows?

01:30:54.448 --> 01:30:55.282
Who cares?

01:30:55.284 --> 01:30:56.250
It's so good.

01:31:02.159 --> 01:31:03.664
- Oh my god.

01:31:03.666 --> 01:31:04.995
This is never gonna
fit in the car.

01:31:06.933 --> 01:31:12.035
(smooching)
(Lawrence laughing)

01:31:13.544 --> 01:31:14.510
Okay.

01:31:16.140 --> 01:31:17.909
Here we go.

01:31:17.911 --> 01:31:22.881
(uplifting orchestral music)
(noises of the city)

01:31:50.273 --> 01:31:53.274
(knocking on door)

01:32:01.152 --> 01:32:02.723
- Hi.

01:32:02.725 --> 01:32:04.285
My friend said the
fourth floor rooms

01:32:04.287 --> 01:32:05.660
are five times bigger
than regular rooms,

01:32:05.662 --> 01:32:06.485
so I wanted to check it out.

01:32:06.487 --> 01:32:07.893
Is that cool?

01:32:07.895 --> 01:32:10.027
- Yeah, come on in.
- Thank you.

01:32:10.029 --> 01:32:10.995
Cool.

01:32:14.836 --> 01:32:15.769
- Hi.

01:32:17.366 --> 01:32:18.200
I'm Lawrence.

01:32:18.202 --> 01:32:19.168
- I'm Tabitha.

01:32:20.842 --> 01:32:23.403
"Steel Magnolias," cool.

01:32:23.405 --> 01:32:25.273
Do you like movies?

01:32:26.881 --> 01:32:31.785
- Yeah, yeah, I like movies,
but what do you like?

01:32:33.019 --> 01:32:34.414
- I'm really into horticulture.

01:32:34.416 --> 01:32:35.580
- Horticulture?

01:32:35.582 --> 01:32:36.790
Yeah, that's cool.

01:32:38.695 --> 01:32:40.387
How did you get into that?

01:32:40.389 --> 01:32:42.664
I grew up in the
Sunshine Coast in B.C.

01:32:42.666 --> 01:32:44.325
and my parents had a greenhouse,

01:32:44.327 --> 01:32:47.031
so they were just big hippies.

01:32:47.033 --> 01:32:48.197
- Really?

01:32:48.199 --> 01:32:49.528
What did they grow?

01:32:49.530 --> 01:32:50.936
- Weed at one point,

01:32:51.741 --> 01:32:54.203
and cucumber, spinach,

01:32:54.205 --> 01:32:57.371
and then I started growing
my own heirloom tomatoes.

01:32:57.373 --> 01:32:58.911
Okay, I'm gonna head out there

01:32:58.913 --> 01:33:01.441
and tell everyone that
your room is huge.

01:33:02.477 --> 01:33:03.476
- Okay, yeah.

01:33:04.886 --> 01:33:08.690
Thanks for talking
to me about tomatoes.

01:33:08.692 --> 01:33:10.153
- No, I meant like,

01:33:10.155 --> 01:33:12.254
do you wanna go try
and meet people?

01:33:15.996 --> 01:33:17.864
- Um... Yeah, sure, totally.

01:33:18.867 --> 01:33:20.229
- Hey, Mitchell, Janessa,

01:33:20.231 --> 01:33:21.461
this is Lawrence.

01:33:21.463 --> 01:33:23.034
He has a room on
the fourth floor

01:33:23.036 --> 01:33:24.596
and you're right,
it's way bigger.

01:33:24.598 --> 01:33:27.236
- Yeah, I didn't even
know that was a thing.

01:33:28.569 --> 01:33:30.371
Where are you guys from?

01:33:30.373 --> 01:33:32.604
Did you like who they
assigned as your roommates,

01:33:32.606 --> 01:33:34.749
and what you picked
as your major,

01:33:34.751 --> 01:33:36.817
and how have you liked
living in Ottawa?

01:33:36.819 --> 01:33:39.787
Did you have to travel
super far to get here?

01:33:39.789 --> 01:33:40.788
Are your parents okay?

01:33:40.790 --> 01:33:41.789
Are they holding up?

01:33:41.791 --> 01:33:43.318
Do they miss you?

01:33:43.320 --> 01:33:46.761
- Wow, you really
like to ask questions.

01:33:46.763 --> 01:33:47.696
- Yeah.

01:33:48.556 --> 01:33:49.995
Is that bad?

01:33:49.997 --> 01:33:51.667
- No, you're good.

01:33:52.626 --> 01:33:53.933
Come sit down.

01:33:53.935 --> 01:33:55.099
- Okay.

01:33:55.101 --> 01:33:56.496
- Where are you from, Lawrence?

01:34:00.975 --> 01:34:01.842
- Burlington.

01:34:01.844 --> 01:34:03.008
- Burlington?

01:34:03.010 --> 01:34:04.009
I've never heard of that.

01:34:04.011 --> 01:34:05.175
- It's like a suburb--

01:34:05.177 --> 01:34:06.748
- It's just outside of Toronto?

01:34:06.750 --> 01:34:07.573
- Yes, yeah, yeah.
- I'm from Toronto.

01:34:07.575 --> 01:34:08.574
- Me too.

01:34:08.576 --> 01:34:10.411
- Oh, okay, yeah,

01:34:10.413 --> 01:34:11.819
well, you must know how
much Burlington sucks then!

01:34:11.821 --> 01:34:12.919
- I've driven
through it like once.

01:34:12.921 --> 01:34:13.854
- Yeah.

01:34:14.956 --> 01:34:16.483
- That's sweet.

01:34:16.485 --> 01:34:17.517
- But like, what's the
Sunshine Coast like?

01:34:17.519 --> 01:34:18.650
I've never been to B.C.

01:34:18.652 --> 01:34:21.323
- Oh, it's beautiful,

01:34:21.325 --> 01:34:22.489
a lot prettier than here,

01:34:22.491 --> 01:34:24.293
but it's still nice here.
