01:15.290 --> 01:17.015
<i>When I was a kid,</i>

01:17.025 --> 01:19.450
<i>I used to carry
a rabbit's foot for good luck.</i>

01:19.460 --> 01:22.587
<i>But in Somalia,
I traded it for two cold Budweisers</i>

01:22.597 --> 01:25.147
<i>and a back issue of Penthouse.</i>

01:25.701 --> 01:28.727
<i>You hear people talk
about the horrors of war all the time,</i>

01:28.737 --> 01:31.063
<i>but the dirty little secret is,</i>

01:31.073 --> 01:32.731
<i>if you're just reporting it,</i>

01:32.741 --> 01:35.461
<i>war has its bright side as well.</i>

01:36.545 --> 01:38.237
<i>I know, I know. I'm sacrilegious.</i>

01:38.247 --> 01:40.875
<i>But being that close to death,</i>

01:40.949 --> 01:42.608
<i>being that alive,</i>

01:42.618 --> 01:44.643
<i>it's completely addictive.</i>

01:44.653 --> 01:48.818
<i>And if anyone tells you otherwise,
they are lying.</i>

01:49.224 --> 01:50.382
Fuck!

01:50.392 --> 01:52.389
I know.

01:52.399 --> 01:55.795
<i>I worked with Simon Hunt for nine years.</i>

01:56.698 --> 02:00.326
<i>We worked as a team
for the network news covering wars</i>

02:00.336 --> 02:05.776
<i>from El Salvador to Desert Storm
to the killing fields of Bosnia.</i>

02:08.811 --> 02:10.103
Are we moving or what?

02:10.113 --> 02:11.738
Yes, we're moving.

02:11.748 --> 02:14.273
I just wish I had a fucking Quaalude.

02:14.283 --> 02:16.918
<i>No one was crazier than he was.</i>

02:18.621 --> 02:20.580
<i>No one was as dangerous,</i>

02:20.590 --> 02:23.684
<i>as fun, or as good as he was.</i>

02:25.929 --> 02:27.020
Damn!

02:27.030 --> 02:29.750
<i>Even in the very worst of times.</i>

02:33.603 --> 02:36.834
God damn it.

02:44.747 --> 02:46.439
You film any of that?

02:46.449 --> 02:47.640
Are you kidding me?

02:47.650 --> 02:52.178
<i>Well, what the hell are we doing here,
writing for Travel and fucking Leisure?</i>

02:52.188 --> 02:54.715
We're here for one purpose
and one purpose only,

02:54.725 --> 02:56.983
and that's to get some
goddamn news footage here.

02:56.993 --> 02:59.420
That's why you're going to go back out
into this mess and shoot something.

02:59.430 --> 03:00.654
Ridiculous.

03:00.664 --> 03:02.664
Afraid not, Duckie Boy.

03:02.700 --> 03:04.700
Okay. You film it.

03:04.734 --> 03:07.495
- No, you fucking film it.
- You fucking film it.

03:07.505 --> 03:10.731
I don't know how to use
the fucking camera.

03:10.741 --> 03:12.232
Screw me.

03:12.242 --> 03:15.897
<i>Simon gave me balls
I never even knew I had.</i>

03:16.413 --> 03:19.639
<i>Of course, during our years together
I got shot four times,</i>

03:19.649 --> 03:23.049
<i>and Simon never got
as much as a scratch.</i>

03:23.721 --> 03:26.246
<i>But together we won lots of awards.</i>

03:26.256 --> 03:28.015
<i>Simon liked to point out, however,</i>

03:28.025 --> 03:31.252
<i>that news awards were like hemorrhoids:</i>

03:31.262 --> 03:34.237
<i>Eventually, every asshole gets one.</i>

03:34.532 --> 03:38.092
<i>But the fact was
Simon was the best in the business,</i>

03:38.102 --> 03:39.260
<i>and everyone knew it.</i>

03:39.270 --> 03:41.603
<i>He cared the most.</i>

03:41.672 --> 03:44.140
<i>He got the best stories.</i>

03:45.476 --> 03:50.772
<i>But things started to change
during the winter of 1994 in Bosnia.</i>

03:50.782 --> 03:54.676
<i>All the senseless brutality
of every war we had covered</i>

03:54.686 --> 03:58.511
<i>crystallized in one perfect
winter of tragedy.</i>

03:59.590 --> 04:03.083
<i>And then one day Simon snapped.</i>

04:04.929 --> 04:08.923
<i>I guess everyone snaps
once in their lifetime:</i>

04:09.000 --> 04:10.725
<i>At a boss...</i>

04:10.735 --> 04:12.326
<i>at a lover...</i>

04:12.336 --> 04:14.029
<i>at the world.</i>

04:14.039 --> 04:17.440
<i>But Simon's was a doozy.</i>

04:17.509 --> 04:19.738
<i>And I filmed it all,</i>

04:19.810 --> 04:21.970
<i>recording it for every journalism major</i>

04:21.980 --> 04:25.550
<i>to download from here to fucking eternity.</i>

04:27.185 --> 04:31.246
<i>We now go to Simon Hunt
in Bosnia with the story.</i>

04:31.256 --> 04:33.014
<i>Two years into a civil war</i>

04:33.024 --> 04:36.085
<i>that has ravaged
this once multi-ethnic country,</i>

04:36.095 --> 04:38.186
<i>Doctor Boghanovic's Bosnian Serb army</i>

04:38.196 --> 04:42.757
<i>continues in its quest to liquidate
the Bosnian Muslims from this region,</i>

04:42.767 --> 04:47.462
<i>today attacking yet another
supposed UN-protected village at will.</i>

04:47.472 --> 04:48.797
<i>Simon, some are saying</i>

04:48.807 --> 04:51.499
<i>that it was the Bosnian Muslims
who attacked first,</i>

04:51.509 --> 04:53.804
<i>causing this latest battle.</i>

04:58.618 --> 05:01.043
<i>- Simon, some are saying...
- It wasn't a battle, Franklin.</i>

05:01.053 --> 05:03.512
<i>It wasn't a battle, it was a slaughter.</i>

05:03.522 --> 05:06.983
<i>Well, Simon, certain
United Nations observers confirm...</i>

05:06.993 --> 05:08.084
<i>Who are you talking about?</i>

05:08.094 --> 05:11.756
<i>Are you talking about the Dutch?</i>

05:11.831 --> 05:13.723
<i>The Dutch?</i>

05:13.733 --> 05:15.925
<i>The Dutch were getting drunk</i>

05:15.935 --> 05:18.294
<i>with the Serb army guys on slivovice</i>

05:18.304 --> 05:20.563
<i>at the checkpoint earlier this morning.</i>

05:20.573 --> 05:23.332
<i>- Okay, thank you, Simon Hunt...
- Safe areas?</i>

05:23.342 --> 05:25.636
<i>These people were butchered!</i>

05:25.646 --> 05:27.069
<i>Women were raped!</i>

05:27.079 --> 05:28.971
<i>Children were murdered!</i>

05:28.981 --> 05:31.074
<i>Oh, come on, Franklin!</i>

05:31.150 --> 05:33.810
<i>Come on, don't get your panties
all in a twist.</i>

05:33.820 --> 05:35.379
<i>- We're live, Simon.
- Lathered up.</i>

05:35.389 --> 05:39.482
<i>You and your editor boys,
you can cut this part out of air.</i>

05:39.492 --> 05:41.787
<i>Timid little network cunts.</i>

05:42.695 --> 05:47.057
<i>There have been many distinguished
moments in television history.</i>

05:47.067 --> 05:49.107
<i>This wasn't one of them.</i>

05:53.039 --> 05:55.674
<i>After that, everything changed.</i>

05:58.278 --> 06:00.743
<i>Simon, of course, got canned.</i>

06:06.953 --> 06:08.712
<i>And I, on the other hand,</i>

06:08.722 --> 06:12.632
<i>received the opposite end
of the network spear.</i>

06:13.760 --> 06:15.760
<i>I got promoted.</i>

06:16.563 --> 06:19.589
<i>Guess a little reward for having to endure</i>

06:19.599 --> 06:21.725
<i>the embarrassment that was Simon Hunt</i>

06:21.735 --> 06:23.896
<i>for all those years.</i>

06:23.970 --> 06:28.565
<i>I got sent to New York and was offered
the cushiest job in the business:</i>

06:28.575 --> 06:31.738
<i>Chief cameraman for Franklin Harris,</i>

06:31.812 --> 06:35.010
<i>the network anchorman.</i>

06:35.082 --> 06:38.746
<i>I suddenly had what
everyone else wanted:</i>

06:38.820 --> 06:40.645
<i>World capitals,</i>

06:40.655 --> 06:42.080
<i>state dinners,</i>

06:42.090 --> 06:45.253
<i>first-class jets.</i>

06:45.326 --> 06:49.661
<i>And I took advantage
of every gift bag they gave me.</i>

06:52.300 --> 06:54.300
<i>Simon had it harder.</i>

06:54.901 --> 06:58.028
<i>- Much harder.
- Simon Hunt here in Northern Gaza.</i>

06:58.038 --> 07:01.566
<i>He stumbled through
a half dozen cable news jobs,</i>

07:01.576 --> 07:04.551
<i>one more demeaning than the next...</i>

07:06.647 --> 07:08.306
What the fuck are you doing?

07:08.316 --> 07:10.375
<i>...which usually ended with him quitting</i>

07:10.385 --> 07:13.411
<i>or getting fired for insubordination.</i>

07:13.421 --> 07:16.181
Got great tape!
Great, great tape!

07:16.191 --> 07:19.717
<i>Finally he hit the bottom rung
of a journalist's career:</i>

07:19.727 --> 07:23.287
<i>Showing up at a war
on nobody's dime but his own.</i>

07:23.297 --> 07:24.756
$500.

07:24.766 --> 07:26.224
I'll take five hundred.

07:26.234 --> 07:27.826
A world exclusive.

07:27.836 --> 07:30.804
Don't you owe me
300 from Gaza?

07:33.374 --> 07:35.374
<i>It's a shitty life.</i>

07:35.911 --> 07:39.438
<i>Soon after that, I stopped hearing
from Simon altogether.</i>

07:39.448 --> 07:42.808
<i>And then he dropped
completely off the radar.</i>

07:42.818 --> 07:44.977
<i>There were rumors of spottings</i>

07:44.987 --> 07:48.847
<i>in certain war zones
you wouldn't even want to fly over.</i>

07:48.857 --> 07:51.985
<i>Stories like that.</i>

07:52.060 --> 07:54.688
<i>And then slowly...</i>

07:54.763 --> 07:56.763
<i>the stories stopped.</i>

07:57.266 --> 07:59.734
<i>As for me?</i>

07:59.802 --> 08:02.669
<i>Did I miss the action?</i>

08:02.738 --> 08:06.498
<i>Did I want to go back
to the carnage and craziness?</i>

08:06.508 --> 08:08.700
<i>The adrenaline and nonstop erection</i>

08:08.710 --> 08:13.204
<i>that comes from fear and death and war?</i>

08:13.282 --> 08:15.282
<i>Absolutely not.</i>

08:16.919 --> 08:19.809
<i>And that was the lie I lived with.</i>

09:11.442 --> 09:13.434
- Watch the land mine.
- What?

09:13.444 --> 09:15.401
Okay, that's not funny.

09:15.411 --> 09:17.004
No, I just read there's
supposed to still be

09:17.014 --> 09:19.507
over 500,000 un-detonated land mines
in this country.

09:19.517 --> 09:21.408
You know, the last time I was here,

09:21.418 --> 09:23.711
there was a sniper positioned right there

09:23.721 --> 09:25.613
taking potshots at my ass.

09:25.623 --> 09:28.215
Five-year anniversary. It's a good story.

09:28.225 --> 09:30.484
Duck, you should talk
to some of your old contacts

09:30.494 --> 09:32.494
and work with Benjamin.

09:32.563 --> 09:35.221
I want to do something
on the reconciliation.

09:35.231 --> 09:38.024
You know, Muslim and Serb widow
sort of thing.

09:38.034 --> 09:39.592
- Yes, sir. It will be done.
- Good.

09:39.602 --> 09:40.895
- Watch the land mine.
- What?

09:40.905 --> 09:42.930
Okay, really, this isn't funny.

09:42.940 --> 09:44.565
First overseas assignment

09:44.575 --> 09:45.866
producing a piece on something

09:45.876 --> 09:47.868
you seem to know very little about,

09:47.878 --> 09:49.436
could be pretty damn funny.

09:49.446 --> 09:50.738
Yeah, Franklin and my father

09:50.748 --> 09:52.807
thought this would be a good
first foreign assignment for me.

09:52.817 --> 09:54.642
You know, get my feet wet.

09:54.652 --> 09:57.087
And whose kid are you again?

09:57.154 --> 09:59.619
The network vice-president's.

10:00.357 --> 10:02.049
- Oh.
- Yeah.

10:02.059 --> 10:03.484
I'm trying to read everything I can,

10:03.494 --> 10:05.353
but this war was complicated as all hell.

10:05.363 --> 10:07.155
It was hell.

10:07.165 --> 10:10.310
Ain't nothing complicated about that.

10:41.533 --> 10:43.533
<i># Pusti, pusti, modu #</i>

10:43.603 --> 10:45.603
<i># Pusti, pusti, modu #</i>

10:53.245 --> 10:55.503
Look what the cat dragged in.

10:55.513 --> 10:57.513
Duck!

10:58.016 --> 11:00.342
He has actually graced
us with his presence.

11:00.352 --> 11:02.078
And his expense account.
Drinks on the network.

11:02.088 --> 11:04.579
No, it's not.
Don't listen to anything he says.

11:04.589 --> 11:05.648
Hey, man.

11:05.658 --> 11:07.216
Back in the trenches
with the commoners, huh?

11:07.226 --> 11:09.417
- Oh, Brady, you look great.
- Good to see you, man.

11:09.427 --> 11:11.653
- You look like shit, mate.
- So does your mama.

11:11.663 --> 11:13.655
It's all that money and pussy.
It's fucking destroyed him.

11:13.665 --> 11:15.223
Two Sarajevskas, please.

11:15.233 --> 11:17.126
Excuse me if I can afford a bar of soap.

11:17.136 --> 11:18.694
All y'all look like y'all need a bath.

11:18.704 --> 11:20.797
Duck!

11:20.873 --> 11:23.724
- We have a very special
guest this evening.

11:23.734 --> 11:24.734
What?

11:24.744 --> 11:26.569
- And she's a virgin.
- No.

11:26.579 --> 11:28.873
We gonna get her fucked up!

11:28.883 --> 11:30.873
Your first time,
and you're traveling with Duck?

11:30.883 --> 11:32.508
I hope you brought your flak jacket.

11:32.518 --> 11:34.443
Last newbie who traveled with him
lost one of his balls.

11:34.453 --> 11:35.645
It's true.

11:35.655 --> 11:37.480
That's why they sent the Duck
back to New York.

11:37.490 --> 11:40.217
He attracts mortar fire
like shit attracts flies.

11:40.227 --> 11:42.284
- Jubilee, buddy.
- Jubilee.

11:42.294 --> 11:45.025
It's good to see you.

11:45.097 --> 11:48.124
It's insane. NATO has 20,000
peace-keeping troops

11:48.134 --> 11:50.126
in a country half the size of Kentucky,

11:50.136 --> 11:52.195
and they can't find
any of these fucking war criminals.

11:52.205 --> 11:54.697
There's no way this country is going
to get its economy back up

11:54.707 --> 11:56.832
until it starts catching
some of these assholes.

11:56.842 --> 11:58.568
Until they catch the Fox.

11:58.578 --> 12:00.937
Now that would be a great story.

12:00.947 --> 12:02.947
Yeah? Who's the Fox?

12:07.020 --> 12:09.712
Where's that Bosnian war book
you've been reading?

12:09.722 --> 12:10.914
Uh-oh.

12:10.924 --> 12:12.215
It never gets old.

12:12.225 --> 12:13.350
It's not pretty.

12:13.360 --> 12:15.360
Thank you.

12:17.129 --> 12:19.856
Doctor Dragoslav Boghanovic,
the Fox,

12:19.866 --> 12:23.597
is the most wanted war criminal in Bosnia.

12:23.670 --> 12:25.896
During the war,
he ordered the rape and murder

12:25.906 --> 12:29.069
of thousands of innocent Muslims.

12:31.278 --> 12:35.953
There's a $5 million bounty
on his little arrogant head.

12:36.550 --> 12:37.741
Oh.

12:37.751 --> 12:39.109
Yeah.

12:39.119 --> 12:42.112
You got everyone from the UN,

12:42.189 --> 12:44.556
CIA, and NATO,

12:44.624 --> 12:47.018
and every bounty hunter
from here to Chuck Norris

12:47.028 --> 12:48.185
looking for him.

12:48.195 --> 12:52.275
I think that poor boy needs
some slivovice quick.

12:52.400 --> 12:53.858
It's good.

12:53.868 --> 12:55.025
It's brandy.

12:55.035 --> 12:56.894
Yeah? How good?

12:56.904 --> 12:59.230
Let's put it this way.
There's an old Bosnian saying

12:59.240 --> 13:01.531
that when a bottle of this stuff
is on the table,

13:01.541 --> 13:05.196
the devil's sitting in the corner laughing.

13:06.680 --> 13:08.840
You know what I was just thinking of?

13:08.850 --> 13:12.076
If every day is a holiday
at the Holiday Inn...

13:12.086 --> 13:14.145
- That's not your room.
- I know.

13:14.155 --> 13:16.180
Then what do they do...

13:16.257 --> 13:18.983
What do they do about Christmas time?

13:18.993 --> 13:20.852
Look, man,
if I don't see you at breakfast,

13:20.862 --> 13:22.553
I'm going to have NATO send a task force

13:22.563 --> 13:23.755
to search for you.

13:23.765 --> 13:25.761
Okay.

13:25.771 --> 13:27.726
Good night, Duck.

13:27.736 --> 13:29.026
Hey, hey, hey!

13:29.036 --> 13:30.128
Duck!

13:30.138 --> 13:31.330
Oh, God.

13:31.340 --> 13:33.340
Oh, God.

13:43.117 --> 13:45.412
- Hello, Duckie.
- Oh, fuck!

13:48.457 --> 13:50.457
Simon.

13:51.927 --> 13:53.927
Surprise.

13:54.896 --> 13:56.896
How the hell are you?

13:59.234 --> 14:01.234
Get over here.

14:02.671 --> 14:04.062
Been good.

14:04.072 --> 14:06.506
Been good.
Been around.

14:06.575 --> 14:08.934
Amazing how many
crappy wars you'll find

14:08.944 --> 14:11.103
if you go looking for 'em.

14:11.113 --> 14:14.514
- But you're okay?
- Yeah, sure. Yeah.

14:14.583 --> 14:16.793
I've been getting through.

14:18.421 --> 14:21.648
I hope you don't mind.
I raided your honor bar over there.

14:21.658 --> 14:25.050
Purloined a few
of your little bottles of vodka.

14:25.060 --> 14:26.718
So what else is new?

14:26.728 --> 14:30.088
I watched you guys today
doing your report up on a bridge.

14:30.098 --> 14:32.157
Franklin's not looking half bad.

14:32.167 --> 14:34.193
He have some work done?

14:34.269 --> 14:37.170
- Eyelift.
- Oh.

14:37.240 --> 14:40.266
- But you were watching us, huh?
- Yeah. Yeah.

14:40.276 --> 14:42.276
Yeah, I was...

14:42.846 --> 14:44.404
I was hoping maybe I could convince you

14:44.414 --> 14:47.472
to shoot my stand-up report
tomorrow at the ceremony.

14:47.482 --> 14:49.747
You know, old times' sake.

14:49.819 --> 14:52.287
Yeah, sure.

14:52.355 --> 14:54.113
You know,
I could save a little money

14:54.123 --> 14:58.116
if I didn't have to hire
a cameraman, so...

14:58.194 --> 15:02.358
I'm going to sell it
to the Germans or Jamaicans.

15:03.733 --> 15:05.733
Yeah.

15:16.446 --> 15:18.446
Fuck, Simon.

15:19.850 --> 15:24.479
You know, I meant to try
and track you down.

15:25.656 --> 15:27.656
Don't worry about it.

15:34.531 --> 15:36.531
Don't worry, Duck.

15:44.774 --> 15:47.141
I heard rumors.

15:47.211 --> 15:49.611
They're all true.

15:54.585 --> 15:56.585
I got something, Duck.

15:57.655 --> 16:00.215
Not just the anniversary,
I got a real story.

16:00.225 --> 16:04.318
Something that could put me
right back on the map.

16:04.328 --> 16:07.643
I thought you might be interested. Huh?

16:15.406 --> 16:16.830
It's not like I don't want to.

16:16.840 --> 16:17.933
I just...

16:17.943 --> 16:21.640
You know, I'd do anything for you.

16:21.713 --> 16:24.272
But I'm meeting this girl in Greece
the day after tomorrow,

16:24.282 --> 16:27.841
and it's just not something
I can cancel, you know?

16:27.851 --> 16:29.276
Just shitty timing.

16:29.286 --> 16:33.417
I got this three-week vacation and all.

16:33.491 --> 16:36.184
Look, but I'll still do
your stand-up tomorrow.

16:36.194 --> 16:39.254
Look, l... I got to get out of here.

16:40.031 --> 16:42.031
What, already?

16:42.567 --> 16:44.567
Simon!

16:44.903 --> 16:47.804
- Great to see you, Duck.
- Simon!

16:57.516 --> 17:02.384
The white doves released
to denote peace around the world.

17:02.455 --> 17:06.790
Peace especially in Sarajevo
and Bosnia-Herzegovina.

17:15.834 --> 17:17.834
Simon Hunt.

17:18.471 --> 17:20.329
I thought you were dead.

17:20.339 --> 17:21.597
Franklin.

17:21.607 --> 17:23.366
You look good.

17:23.376 --> 17:25.376
Very taut.

17:26.911 --> 17:28.671
Duck said you were coming by here.

17:28.681 --> 17:32.008
That's fine with me
if you wanna piggyback with us.

17:32.018 --> 17:34.577
- I got no hard feelings.
- Oh, thank you.

17:34.587 --> 17:37.613
Thank you, Franklin.
Magnanimous as always.

17:37.623 --> 17:39.915
I promise I won't try to steal Duckie back.

17:39.925 --> 17:43.185
Oh, you can't afford him.
Hell, I could hardly afford him.

17:43.195 --> 17:46.655
Benjamin, meet Simon Hunt,
a former star with our network.

17:46.665 --> 17:48.997
Simon, Benjamin Strauss.

17:49.068 --> 17:52.161
Benjamin, you look young enough
to be someone important's son.

17:52.171 --> 17:55.146
Yeah. The network vice-president's.

17:56.509 --> 17:59.068
You know, I thought you were dead, too.

17:59.078 --> 18:01.546
What?

18:01.615 --> 18:03.774
Simon used to be our best correspondent

18:03.784 --> 18:07.310
till he flamed out on national television.

18:07.320 --> 18:09.320
Yeah. No, I remember.

18:10.556 --> 18:14.126
I mean, we studied it
in journalism school.

18:18.398 --> 18:22.562
Reporting from
the five-year anniversary ceremony

18:22.635 --> 18:27.310
for Jamaican television,
this is Simon Hunt in Sarajevo.

18:29.309 --> 18:32.402
Reporting for Peruvian state television,

18:32.412 --> 18:35.074
I'm Simon Hunt in Sarajevo.

18:35.148 --> 18:38.942
Reporting for
the Polish television news network,

18:38.952 --> 18:41.247
I'm Simon Hunt in Sarajevo.

18:41.288 --> 18:44.481
I hope one of these bastards buys this.

18:44.491 --> 18:46.516
Hope so.

18:46.594 --> 18:49.653
Check the atlas.
I don't think you got any countries left.

18:49.663 --> 18:51.388
Yeah, well,

18:51.398 --> 18:53.023
considering what I got up my sleeve,

18:53.033 --> 18:55.033
it won't matter much.

19:00.674 --> 19:04.969
Hey, get this back to the hotel.
I'll meet you there later.

19:04.979 --> 19:07.954
All right, daddy, what's the story?

19:09.382 --> 19:10.775
You make the call?

19:10.785 --> 19:11.975
What call?

19:11.985 --> 19:14.535
To your little Greek souvlaki.

19:16.790 --> 19:18.682
'Cause this story's too big to waste

19:18.692 --> 19:23.877
if you're just going to get on a plane
like Facelift Franklin.

19:27.735 --> 19:29.694
You're getting soft, Duckie.

19:29.704 --> 19:32.530
You've gotten real soft
around the edges.

19:32.540 --> 19:34.599
You're like a racehorse
that's been put out to pasture.

19:34.609 --> 19:36.400
Yeah, and you can fuck off, Simon.

19:36.410 --> 19:39.036
But when I know that you're ready
to do serious journalism,

19:39.046 --> 19:42.207
instead of that anchorman fluff
they've reduced you to,

19:42.217 --> 19:44.217
I'll fill you in, okay?

19:46.021 --> 19:48.996
What's the story, you motherfucker?

19:52.494 --> 19:54.494
It's good.

19:54.695 --> 19:56.695
It's really good.

19:58.467 --> 20:00.467
What?

20:05.407 --> 20:07.407
What?

20:15.284 --> 20:17.284
You know the Fox?

20:17.986 --> 20:22.151
Pompous bastard who's responsible
for all of this?

20:29.164 --> 20:31.160
Yeah.

20:31.170 --> 20:33.291
I know where he's hiding.

20:52.021 --> 20:55.148
So this great source of yours
knows where he's hiding,

20:55.158 --> 20:56.782
just like that?

20:56.792 --> 20:58.016
Yeah. Correct.

20:58.026 --> 21:00.787
And we're going to find him
and score an interview.

21:00.797 --> 21:01.854
Correct.

21:01.864 --> 21:03.523
Go where no bounty hunter

21:03.533 --> 21:05.658
or U.S. Marine has ever gone before.

21:05.668 --> 21:07.668
Correct.

21:10.540 --> 21:13.345
You are out of your fucking mind.

21:15.645 --> 21:19.572
Okay. What about the bodyguards
that he travels with, Simon?

21:19.582 --> 21:21.208
Have you thought about that?

21:21.218 --> 21:24.011
Yeah. Word is he's got 20
armed guards with him at all times.

21:24.021 --> 21:25.812
Yeah? Well, I heard it's 50.

21:25.822 --> 21:27.949
- Fifty?
- Fifty.

21:28.024 --> 21:30.020
Maybe.

21:30.030 --> 21:32.419
Actually, some people
believe he has none.

21:32.429 --> 21:33.854
Stupid people.

21:33.864 --> 21:35.288
Doesn't matter.

21:35.298 --> 21:38.091
He's expecting NATO troops,
not two jerks in a car.

21:38.101 --> 21:39.560
We can get right up to him.

21:39.570 --> 21:40.694
I know the town.

21:40.704 --> 21:42.428
- I have directions.
- You got directions?

21:42.438 --> 21:45.065
What, somebody said
"Make a left at the first Quickie-Mart"?

21:45.075 --> 21:49.336
I don't think they have
Quickie-Marts in Bosnia, Duckie.

21:49.346 --> 21:52.439
Okay, Simon.
This great source of yours...

21:52.449 --> 21:56.104
How do you even know
that you can trust him?

21:58.722 --> 22:00.722
It's real.

22:02.825 --> 22:05.819
He says he's hiding
up in the mountains of Celibici,

22:05.829 --> 22:08.355
right by the border of Montenegro.

22:08.365 --> 22:10.591
You go one step over the border,
NATO can't catch you.

22:10.601 --> 22:11.925
No, no, no.

22:11.935 --> 22:15.496
- They've been printing that gossip...
- He's there. He's in the mountains.

22:15.506 --> 22:17.197
He's there! He...

22:17.207 --> 22:19.199
He's an hour and a half
up an unpaved road.

22:19.209 --> 22:22.002
He's surrounded
by sympathetic Bosnian Serbs

22:22.012 --> 22:24.139
who will protect him...

22:24.215 --> 22:26.215
at all costs.

22:28.719 --> 22:31.587
That's just fucking great.

22:31.655 --> 22:35.140
We're leaving first thing in the morning.

22:37.594 --> 22:42.189
If you could see me in this bikini, Duck,
you wouldn't be doing this.

22:42.199 --> 22:44.059
Come on. Come on, baby.

22:44.069 --> 22:48.063
Look, it's... I promise it's just going
to be two more days, okay?

22:48.073 --> 22:49.998
Oh, well, I can wait.

22:50.008 --> 22:52.133
But I don't know for how long.

22:52.143 --> 22:54.338
You're torturing me.

22:54.412 --> 22:55.837
<i>And you're torturing me.</i>

22:55.847 --> 22:57.847
So we're even.

22:58.283 --> 23:01.343
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

23:04.989 --> 23:07.749
I must be a complete fucking idiot.

23:07.759 --> 23:10.853
Hey, look, I know I'm new
and green and a joke to you,

23:10.863 --> 23:12.787
but I just graduated
from Harvard, okay?

23:12.797 --> 23:15.425
And I know something's up.

23:15.500 --> 23:17.859
I haven't the slightest idea
what you're talking about.

23:17.869 --> 23:21.463
Oh, come on.
You and Simon, you're onto a story.

23:21.473 --> 23:22.797
Me and Simon are just hanging out.

23:22.807 --> 23:25.367
I saw your girlfriend when she
came by the office two weeks ago.

23:25.377 --> 23:26.701
She is hotter than hot.

23:26.711 --> 23:30.281
You don't leave her in Greece to hang out.

23:30.382 --> 23:32.841
You been listening to my conversations?

23:32.851 --> 23:34.043
No.

23:34.053 --> 23:35.543
No, it was, um...

23:35.553 --> 23:39.147
No, the official term
is eavesdropping, all right?

23:39.157 --> 23:41.157
Little shit.

23:41.994 --> 23:43.986
Look, I know something's up, all right?

23:43.996 --> 23:45.054
I want in on it.

23:45.064 --> 23:46.589
Forget it. There's no story.

23:46.599 --> 23:48.724
I went to Harvard, okay?
I know there's a story.

23:48.734 --> 23:51.193
What is up with this Harvard shit?

23:51.203 --> 23:52.995
You know, I dated a girl
from Harvard once,

23:53.005 --> 23:55.810
and she wasn't so fucking bright.

23:57.143 --> 23:59.702
Look, my father is a cold,
mean son of a bitch,

23:59.712 --> 24:01.737
and he thinks I'm soft and weak

24:01.747 --> 24:03.639
and not quite cut out
for this type of work.

24:03.649 --> 24:05.641
And there's no way on God's green earth
I'm going to prove that to him

24:05.651 --> 24:08.378
by letting you get
a great story without me.

24:08.388 --> 24:10.579
How do you know it's so great?

24:10.589 --> 24:12.114
You're hanging out with a guy

24:12.124 --> 24:13.816
who had a fucking meltdown
on national television

24:13.826 --> 24:15.284
and is a punch line in the business.

24:15.294 --> 24:19.034
If it wasn't good, you
wouldn't be doing it.

24:24.938 --> 24:26.296
Look at you.

24:26.306 --> 24:28.686
Little Mike-fucking-Wallace.

24:31.344 --> 24:33.344
Okay.

24:33.846 --> 24:36.339
But Simon ain't going to like this.

24:36.349 --> 24:38.275
Yeah?

24:38.285 --> 24:41.175
Well, I ain't going to like Simon.

24:49.396 --> 24:51.021
You see, his main bodyguard

24:51.031 --> 24:54.324
is this psychopathic little fuck
named Srdjan.

24:54.334 --> 24:56.330
He had a real fondness

24:56.340 --> 24:59.529
for raping and mutilating
these very young Muslim girls

24:59.539 --> 25:02.633
as he was ethnically
cleansing the villages.

25:02.643 --> 25:05.870
- Jesus.
- Oh, that ain't the good part.

25:05.880 --> 25:08.806
Shit, the good part,
Benjamin, is this Srdjan,

25:08.816 --> 25:10.941
the guy in charge of protecting the Fox,

25:10.951 --> 25:14.745
he's got this tattoo on his forehead
that reads in Cyrillic,

25:14.755 --> 25:17.475
"I was dead the day I was born."

25:19.560 --> 25:22.705
They teach that evil shit at Harvard?

25:23.498 --> 25:27.458
Now, we are headed right into the heart
of this Balkan madness,

25:27.468 --> 25:29.026
into Serb territory.

25:29.036 --> 25:30.628
Republica Srpska.

25:30.638 --> 25:31.963
It's a backward land

25:31.973 --> 25:34.831
where they will kill you
for trying to hurt Boghanovic

25:34.841 --> 25:38.102
as easily as somebody kills a mosquito.

25:38.112 --> 25:40.112
The Fox is their god.

25:41.182 --> 25:43.307
People protect their god.

25:44.085 --> 25:47.715
Now, if you're still interested...

25:47.788 --> 25:49.788
we leave in 20 minutes.

26:12.847 --> 26:15.907
Let's go find us some war criminals.

26:42.144 --> 26:44.840
# 20, 24 hours ago #

26:44.913 --> 26:46.705
# I wanna... I wanna be #

26:46.715 --> 26:49.115
# I wanna be sedated #

26:49.184 --> 26:52.010
Hey, Benjamin, you know what that is
that we're passing?

26:52.020 --> 26:54.346
Yeah, it looks like, uh, a ski lift.

26:54.356 --> 26:57.784
'84 Winter Olympics
was held right here in Sarajevo.

26:57.794 --> 27:02.421
Eight years later, the Fox used this area
as a staging ground for his snipers.

27:02.431 --> 27:04.756
Won the gold medal, triple lutz.

27:04.766 --> 27:06.492
Best all around scumbag.

27:06.502 --> 27:09.095
Are you going to be playing that damn thing
all the way to Montenegro?

27:09.105 --> 27:11.898
Yep. Simon never liked
my guitar playing.

27:11.908 --> 27:13.333
Really?

27:13.343 --> 27:15.343
Can't say I do, either.

27:16.045 --> 27:19.020
So it's going to be like that, huh?

27:19.749 --> 27:22.149
# 20, 20, 24 hours a day #

27:22.218 --> 27:26.379
- All right. Very funny.
- # I want to play the damn thing #

27:26.389 --> 27:28.348
So what is your master plan?

27:28.358 --> 27:30.149
You have a contact when
we get to this town?

27:30.159 --> 27:32.653
Nope. Never been up there before.

27:32.663 --> 27:35.421
I'm just going to start knocking on doors.

27:35.431 --> 27:38.258
You see that? Signs are in Cyrillic now.

27:38.268 --> 27:41.361
We've entered Republica Srpska.

27:41.437 --> 27:42.595
That quickly?

27:42.605 --> 27:44.364
Ten minutes outside of Sarajevo,

27:44.374 --> 27:47.434
and we're in the land
of milk and honey and rape and pillage.

27:47.444 --> 27:49.836
- Are we going to be okay here?
- Who the hell knows?

27:49.846 --> 27:54.096
But $5 million is $5 million,
and I'm not stopping.

27:55.218 --> 27:57.077
$5 million?

27:57.087 --> 27:58.911
Reward.

27:58.921 --> 28:00.114
3 is for me.

28:00.124 --> 28:02.182
The rest is for you guys
to split as you please.

28:02.192 --> 28:04.351
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Reward?

28:04.361 --> 28:06.419
You're not actually thinking
of capturing him, are you?

28:06.429 --> 28:09.222
He may be thinking it,
but it ain't going to happen.

28:09.232 --> 28:12.125
- Don't be so sure.
- Don't be so stupid.

28:12.135 --> 28:15.796
After this interview's finished,
everything's in play, my friends.

28:15.806 --> 28:17.765
Whoa. Hold on.
Duck, this is nuts.

28:17.775 --> 28:19.400
You're not really supporting this, are you?

28:19.410 --> 28:21.235
One time in Rwanda,

28:21.245 --> 28:24.405
Simon decided he was going
to assassinate the leader of the Hutus

28:24.415 --> 28:25.706
and end the war.

28:25.716 --> 28:27.574
Three days later, he was in Morocco

28:27.584 --> 28:29.610
getting a massage
from a hooker named Gladys.

28:29.620 --> 28:33.714
Simon has his whims,
but this one I am not supporting.

28:33.724 --> 28:35.115
This isn't a whim.

28:35.125 --> 28:37.855
You know what this means to me.

28:37.928 --> 28:39.953
Okay, we are journalists.
We can't do this.

28:39.963 --> 28:42.590
It's... It's unethical and... and insane.

28:42.600 --> 28:45.393
It would be a pleasure
to personally catch him.

28:45.403 --> 28:47.661
By ourselves. By ourselves.
We don't even have any weapons.

28:47.671 --> 28:49.731
If I gave you a gun,
would you know how to use it?

28:49.741 --> 28:50.799
No.

28:50.809 --> 28:54.549
Then what the fuck
are you complaining about?

28:56.647 --> 28:58.173
I told you.

28:58.183 --> 29:01.609
The moment you start drinking
that Bosnian brandy,

29:01.619 --> 29:05.614
the devil's sitting in the corner
just laughing.

29:46.998 --> 29:49.457
Do we know any actual facts at all, guys?

29:49.467 --> 29:50.960
<i>My buddy at Newsweek says</i>

29:50.970 --> 29:52.728
he's so afraid of getting caught

29:52.738 --> 29:56.198
that he's grown his hair out
and has a full Orthodox beard.

29:56.208 --> 29:58.834
Funny.'Cause I heard
he actually shaved his head.

29:58.844 --> 30:00.844
He's bald as a turd.

30:01.680 --> 30:06.008
Now, what we do know is that the Fox
drives in a convoy of orange cars.

30:06.018 --> 30:08.144
All right?
So we should keep a lookout for them.

30:08.154 --> 30:10.412
That's funny, Simon.
I heard he's traveling around

30:10.422 --> 30:12.515
in a stolen UN de-mining vehicle.

30:12.525 --> 30:14.917
Well then, we should keep
an eye out for that, too.

30:14.927 --> 30:15.985
Yeah, that's great.

30:15.995 --> 30:18.220
There's only a thousand
UN de-mining trucks in this country.

30:18.230 --> 30:19.555
Why don't we stop each one?

30:19.565 --> 30:22.224
"Hey, knock, knock.
Is the Fox in there? No?"

30:22.234 --> 30:26.196
Okay, well, we should be done in,
what, say, 9 to 12 years.

30:26.206 --> 30:27.696
One second he's pissing himself

30:27.706 --> 30:29.632
'cause he's afraid we might
actually run into the Fox,

30:29.642 --> 30:32.501
the next he's complaining
'cause we probably won't.

30:32.511 --> 30:35.070
No, I'm not... I'm not complaining.

30:35.080 --> 30:37.276
I'm mocking.

30:42.689 --> 30:44.689
Wow.

30:45.258 --> 30:47.258
The Doctor is not bald.

30:49.729 --> 30:52.356
He is not desperate.

30:52.432 --> 30:54.642
And he is not in Celibici.

30:58.438 --> 31:01.066
He is everywhere.

31:01.141 --> 31:03.371
He know everything.

31:03.444 --> 31:06.810
He listens to everything you say.

31:06.880 --> 31:09.644
And if you get close to the Fox,

31:09.717 --> 31:11.717
if you corner him,

31:13.253 --> 31:16.245
then even God can't help you.

31:24.197 --> 31:26.390
What the fuck was that about?

31:26.400 --> 31:27.725
A little warning.

31:27.735 --> 31:29.359
Yeah? It seemed more like a threat.

31:29.369 --> 31:33.773
Yeah. Beware of the nosy waiter
with Serbian pride.

31:33.840 --> 31:35.766
Actually, it was the
first time that I thought

31:35.776 --> 31:38.101
that maybe Simon wasn't
jerking our chain.

31:38.111 --> 31:39.303
Yeah? Why is that?

31:39.313 --> 31:42.540
Because the guy in there said
that he's not in Celebici,

31:42.550 --> 31:45.309
which means maybe
he actually is in Celebici.

31:45.319 --> 31:48.479
Right.
Unless he's really not in Celebici.

31:48.489 --> 31:51.890
Well, that's a possibility, too.

31:59.835 --> 32:01.626
- Jeez!
- Holy shit!

32:01.636 --> 32:03.636
Get down!

32:05.306 --> 32:07.306
Hold on.

32:19.788 --> 32:21.780
What in the fuck was that about, man?

32:21.790 --> 32:24.622
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

32:24.693 --> 32:25.817
We're going to die.

32:25.827 --> 32:27.819
Every single person out here
knows exactly what we're doing.

32:27.829 --> 32:29.955
Keep your panties dry, Benjamin.

32:29.965 --> 32:32.658
- It had nothing to do with the Fox.
- What the hell do you mean?

32:32.668 --> 32:37.853
It's just a little local tradition
to shoot at every customer?

32:37.906 --> 32:40.807
Wait a minute.
Is that my money?

32:40.875 --> 32:43.502
You mean the money I left on the table?
That's mine?

32:43.512 --> 32:45.912
- Simon!
- Times are tight.

32:45.981 --> 32:48.273
- Things happen. Sue me.
- Wait, wait, wait.

32:48.283 --> 32:50.309
You stole the money
that was left for the bill?

32:50.319 --> 32:53.312
- I needed it more.
- Okay, you got us shot at for 20 bucks.

32:53.322 --> 32:56.807
I didn't know he was going
to shoot at us.

33:01.831 --> 33:03.831
Unbelievable!

33:07.002 --> 33:09.195
Much gun play when you and Franklin

33:09.205 --> 33:11.898
do your stories about
the president's new tax code?

33:11.908 --> 33:13.832
- Fuck off.
- Come on, Duckie.

33:13.842 --> 33:16.310
You enjoyed it, didn't you?

33:16.379 --> 33:19.694
A little taste of what you left behind?

33:20.449 --> 33:22.782
Don't say you didn't.

33:22.852 --> 33:27.016
<i># It's a bad situation
in a beautiful place #</i>

33:27.089 --> 33:30.924
<i># It's a bad situation
in a beautiful place #</i>

33:30.993 --> 33:36.864
<i># It's a bad situation #</i>

33:50.980 --> 33:53.841
That pile of rubble used to be a mosque.

33:53.851 --> 33:56.676
Now the town's
a hundred percent Bosnian Serb.

33:56.686 --> 33:58.478
No Muslims left.

33:58.488 --> 34:01.514
Ethnically cleansed for your protection.

34:01.524 --> 34:02.882
Nice vibe, right?

34:02.892 --> 34:07.489
There's a reason they say
the river runs red in Foca...

34:07.563 --> 34:09.822
and it ain't because of the wine.

34:09.833 --> 34:11.591
What does the Cyrillic say?

34:11.601 --> 34:14.069
It says, "Don't touch him."

34:20.811 --> 34:22.835
- Wait. Where are you going?
- The police.

34:22.846 --> 34:24.973
Need a good laugh.

34:25.049 --> 34:27.449
War criminals?

34:27.518 --> 34:29.443
Believe it or not,
we don't even have a copy

34:29.453 --> 34:31.411
of the complete indictment list.

34:31.420 --> 34:33.380
- You don't?
- No.

34:33.389 --> 34:35.482
Do you have a copy?
I could always Xerox it.

34:35.492 --> 34:38.859
Miriam, is the copier working again?

34:40.397 --> 34:43.991
Word has it there's a bunch of them
living right here in Foca.

34:44.001 --> 34:46.697
Could be.

34:46.771 --> 34:49.696
Unfortunately, we're here
to reform the police force,

34:49.706 --> 34:51.297
not hunt for war criminals.

34:51.308 --> 34:52.801
But it wouldn't be much hunting.

34:52.811 --> 34:55.370
I mean, most of them are listed
right in the phone book.

34:55.380 --> 34:59.706
As I said, we're not authorized
to arrest war criminals.

34:59.716 --> 35:02.709
- You are the international police, right?
- Yes.

35:02.719 --> 35:04.479
Under the flag of the United Nations.

35:04.489 --> 35:06.881
I thought the UN was looking
for war criminals.

35:06.891 --> 35:09.552
We are. Aggressively.

35:09.627 --> 35:12.187
There's a $5 million reward, you know?

35:12.197 --> 35:13.988
But you said you don't have
an indictment list.

35:13.998 --> 35:15.589
We don't.

35:15.599 --> 35:17.599
Donut?

35:19.069 --> 35:21.069
Donut.

35:21.139 --> 35:23.097
Flown in from Bonn.

35:23.107 --> 35:24.165
Very black market.

35:24.175 --> 35:29.700
I particularly like the chocolate ones
with the rainbow sprinkles.

35:29.948 --> 35:33.175
You see, it's the UN that are looking
for war criminals,

35:33.185 --> 35:35.343
not the UN police task force.

35:35.353 --> 35:38.079
No, not the ones
who could actually catch them.

35:38.089 --> 35:40.849
Well, that's one way of looking at it.

35:40.859 --> 35:43.118
Sounds like the usual UN jerk-off to me.

35:43.128 --> 35:45.128
You got any milk?

35:45.397 --> 35:47.423
Look, we're headed up to Celibici now.

35:47.433 --> 35:50.458
We just figured we'd stop in
and register with you

35:50.468 --> 35:53.229
just in case we got killed
or something like that.

35:53.239 --> 35:55.664
Well, consider yourselves registered.

35:55.674 --> 35:59.269
Miriam, uh, be a love and get me a tea.

35:59.344 --> 36:01.102
Four sugars.

36:01.112 --> 36:03.308
Oh, and a glass of milk.

36:04.816 --> 36:06.208
Is there any word

36:06.218 --> 36:08.577
on what's going up there now?

36:08.587 --> 36:10.986
Well, something.

36:11.056 --> 36:15.901
It's third time this year
we've been ordered to stay away.

36:15.928 --> 36:17.987
From Celibici?

36:18.797 --> 36:20.356
Suspicious, no?

36:20.366 --> 36:22.292
Yeah.

36:22.302 --> 36:24.462
Who ordered you?

36:24.538 --> 36:26.061
UN command.

36:26.071 --> 36:29.165
Told us to stay away
for four or five days.

36:29.175 --> 36:30.900
Jesus fucking Christ.

36:30.910 --> 36:33.536
They tell the police
not to go up to Celebici.

36:33.546 --> 36:35.671
I mean, he's actually up there.
I can't fucking believe this.

36:35.681 --> 36:37.673
Why would they tell them
not to go up there?

36:37.683 --> 36:39.109
Tell them not to go up there

36:39.119 --> 36:41.377
because I don't want them
walking into a shootout.

36:41.387 --> 36:43.947
Now, really...

36:44.024 --> 36:46.024
tell me the truth.

36:47.027 --> 36:49.551
Who the fuck are you guys?

36:49.629 --> 36:52.189
I told you, we are journalists.

36:52.199 --> 36:53.355
Journalists?

36:53.365 --> 36:55.225
Yeah. You have our press credentials.

36:55.235 --> 36:57.235
Yes.

36:59.139 --> 37:01.264
Very professionally done.

37:03.510 --> 37:05.902
So, uh, you are journalists who believe

37:05.912 --> 37:09.506
that they can get close to someone
that no one else can.

37:09.516 --> 37:13.111
Yeah. What's the problem?

37:13.186 --> 37:14.578
I understand.

37:14.588 --> 37:15.645
I understand.

37:15.655 --> 37:18.290
You are journalists on a story.

37:20.026 --> 37:24.106
What, you think we're just posing
as journalists?

37:26.867 --> 37:30.393
Do you like beer?
I like beer. Do you like beer?

37:30.403 --> 37:32.403
Let's get a beer.

37:37.811 --> 37:40.504
For a group of UN guards to go,
it's too dangerous.

37:40.514 --> 37:42.914
For you guys? Sure, why not?

37:42.984 --> 37:44.442
Go to Celibici.

37:44.452 --> 37:46.110
Do the world a favor.

37:46.120 --> 37:50.113
I'm sorry, are you still insinuating
we're a CIA hit squad or something?

37:50.123 --> 37:54.218
I'm sorry, are you still insinuating
you're journalists?

37:54.228 --> 37:56.753
Look, um...

37:56.830 --> 37:59.493
I know things.

37:59.567 --> 38:02.195
I know how things operate.

38:02.270 --> 38:04.480
I've been waiting for you.

38:06.741 --> 38:09.667
Certain things need to be taken
care of professionally, right?

38:09.677 --> 38:11.802
- Took me months...
- Shh.

38:14.715 --> 38:16.774
Took me months to gain the trust
of certain people

38:16.784 --> 38:19.111
who normally would be protecting
the Fox.

38:19.121 --> 38:21.214
That's how I know you
didn't just stumble on...

38:21.224 --> 38:22.513
the fact he's up in Celibici.

38:22.523 --> 38:24.849
Well, it's been printed in the press.

38:24.859 --> 38:28.429
So has the horoscopes.
Do you believe them?

38:28.764 --> 38:30.956
- You're not making any sense now.
- I know.

38:30.966 --> 38:33.160
I'm the United Nations.

38:43.312 --> 38:45.304
And fact is, the United Nations...

38:45.314 --> 38:47.605
Oh, fuck.
The French specifically,

38:47.615 --> 38:49.708
they have no interest
in catching the Fox.

38:49.718 --> 38:51.910
They would be happy
if he killed all the Muslims.

38:51.920 --> 38:54.379
Save them all this money and energy.

38:54.389 --> 38:56.681
John Major and the British
backed the Fox,

38:56.691 --> 38:59.418
even though they would never
publicly admit it.

38:59.428 --> 39:02.087
And the Americans...
Yeah, they brokered the peace agreement,

39:02.097 --> 39:04.956
but some would suggest
they made a secret deal with the Fox

39:04.966 --> 39:06.925
that if he stepped down from power,

39:06.935 --> 39:10.420
they would not arrest him for war crimes.

39:10.505 --> 39:14.466
Who knows what's true, what isn't?
The whole fucking thing is dirty.

39:14.476 --> 39:17.206
But in dirty times...

39:17.280 --> 39:20.255
dirty deeds need to be done, right?

39:21.117 --> 39:24.743
One arm of the government said
it would do something, does nothing.

39:24.753 --> 39:26.012
That would be us.

39:26.022 --> 39:27.446
The other hand...

39:27.456 --> 39:29.823
CIA...

39:29.891 --> 39:31.718
whoever...

39:31.728 --> 39:33.728
does something else.

39:33.763 --> 39:35.421
I mean, look at you guys.

39:35.431 --> 39:39.001
Do you really think you're fooling anyone?

39:41.938 --> 39:44.030
He thinks we're a hit squad.

39:44.040 --> 39:46.833
- He thinks we're a fucking hit squad!
- Yeah, this can't be good.

39:46.843 --> 39:49.702
Isn't it illegal,
impersonating a CIA officer?

39:49.712 --> 39:51.070
Yeah, but we denied it.

39:51.080 --> 39:52.205
Yeah, he didn't believe it.

39:52.215 --> 39:55.074
It's true.
It's like the more we fucking denied it,

39:55.084 --> 39:56.576
the more he didn't believe it.

39:56.586 --> 39:59.412
Yeah, the problem is,
if you were CIA you would deny it.

39:59.422 --> 40:02.382
And if you weren't,
you would also deny it.

40:02.392 --> 40:04.284
Actually he's not that far
off the mark, you know?

40:04.294 --> 40:05.619
I mean, we're not CIA,

40:05.629 --> 40:07.587
but we can do a lot more

40:07.597 --> 40:11.227
than just interview the Fox.

40:11.300 --> 40:12.959
Wait. Hold up.

40:12.969 --> 40:15.598
- Simon.
- What?

40:15.671 --> 40:18.832
Now, you're not still
on this capturing jag?

40:18.842 --> 40:21.276
It's not a jag.

40:21.344 --> 40:24.507
Not a jag, not a whim.
Especially now.

40:24.581 --> 40:27.840
Especially since Boris basically confirmed
that he's hiding out up there.

40:27.850 --> 40:29.175
Okay. Now, now, Simon,

40:29.185 --> 40:31.345
I was willing to come along with you

40:31.355 --> 40:34.381
and try to even get close enough
to this psychopathic fuck

40:34.391 --> 40:37.326
to try and get an interview.

40:37.394 --> 40:39.620
But we are not capturing him.

40:39.630 --> 40:41.287
I mean, look at us.

40:41.297 --> 40:44.095
That's not what we do.

40:44.168 --> 40:46.360
I'm checking into that hotel

40:46.370 --> 40:47.628
down the road.

40:47.638 --> 40:50.364
I'm taking a shower,
a shit, and a Seconal.

40:50.374 --> 40:51.665
Tomorrow morning I'm getting up,

40:51.675 --> 40:53.400
I'm driving up that mountain to Celibici,

40:53.410 --> 40:55.537
and I am finding the Fox.

40:55.612 --> 40:57.571
Now, you're welcome to join me, Duckie,

40:57.581 --> 40:59.706
or you're welcome to fuck off.

40:59.716 --> 41:01.716
Your choice.

41:12.830 --> 41:15.635
You think this is crazy too, huh?

41:16.166 --> 41:18.091
I mean, just trying
to get an interview is crazy.

41:18.101 --> 41:20.899
But we're not mercenaries.

41:20.972 --> 41:23.664
Yeah, well, I'm supposed to be
on fucking vacation.

41:23.674 --> 41:25.733
And it makes sense why he had
a meltdown on air.

41:25.743 --> 41:27.743
He's a goddamn nut job.

41:28.680 --> 41:30.972
Yeah, Simon is a goddamn nut job,

41:30.982 --> 41:34.247
but his meltdown wasn't for nothing.

41:34.319 --> 41:37.011
We'd seen some horrible stuff that day.

41:37.021 --> 41:41.101
Yeah, reporters see horrible things
all the time.

41:41.226 --> 41:43.226
That's what they do.

41:46.130 --> 41:47.589
Yeah.

41:47.599 --> 41:50.725
Look, I saw the tape, okay?
He was drunk, high.

41:50.735 --> 41:52.695
He just fucking lost it.

41:52.705 --> 41:56.020
He lost it then,
and he's losing it now.

42:01.613 --> 42:04.514
There was these two girls, right?

42:04.583 --> 42:07.881
Named Marda and Una.

42:07.953 --> 42:10.887
They said they were cousins but...

42:10.956 --> 42:13.649
We used to hang out together
from time to time.

42:13.659 --> 42:15.951
Who the hell knows why they were there.

42:15.961 --> 42:17.319
It was war.

42:17.329 --> 42:19.329
People was broke.

42:19.397 --> 42:21.832
People did things.

42:21.901 --> 42:24.096
All I know is...

42:24.169 --> 42:26.169
we had a good time.

42:26.205 --> 42:28.205
They were our friends.

42:31.010 --> 42:32.234
Somewhere along the line,

42:32.244 --> 42:35.371
maybe the second
or third year into the war,

42:35.381 --> 42:38.781
Simon and Marda,
they had a little thing.

42:41.688 --> 42:44.513
Hell, it was more than a little thing.

42:44.523 --> 42:48.050
Simon, he liked her.

42:49.261 --> 42:51.491
He did things for her.

42:51.565 --> 42:54.857
Whatever little money he had, he gave her.

42:54.867 --> 42:56.493
They didn't spend that much time together.

42:56.503 --> 42:59.165
But it was war, how can you?

42:59.238 --> 43:03.972
But Simon,
in his own little crazy way,

43:04.043 --> 43:06.043
he loved her.

43:08.747 --> 43:12.047
Now, you fast-forward six months.

43:12.118 --> 43:15.312
Sarajevo's under siege worse than ever.

43:15.322 --> 43:19.215
And we haven't heard from Marda
or her cousin for months now.

43:19.225 --> 43:20.984
And only thing we knew

43:20.994 --> 43:23.186
was that Marda had gone back to Polje

43:23.196 --> 43:25.196
to help out her mother.

43:25.932 --> 43:30.861
And then one day we hear
about a serious incident in Polje,

43:30.871 --> 43:33.250
and we go there to cover it.

43:35.176 --> 43:39.111
The horrors we saw.

43:39.179 --> 43:41.179
Fucking inhuman.

43:43.183 --> 43:45.576
Neither Simon nor I said anything,

43:45.586 --> 43:47.344
you know, although we both knew

43:47.354 --> 43:49.814
that Marda was from this town.

43:49.824 --> 43:52.587
We just got ready to do our job,

43:52.660 --> 43:54.660
cover our story.

43:56.897 --> 43:58.922
Inez,

43:59.000 --> 44:00.996
Jasmine,

44:01.006 --> 44:02.259
Amar,

44:02.269 --> 44:03.961
Amin.

44:03.971 --> 44:05.029
No?

44:05.039 --> 44:06.831
How about Aidan?

44:06.841 --> 44:10.641
Or how about Simon Junior?

44:14.382 --> 44:16.543
And then there she was.

44:16.617 --> 44:20.017
Twenty minutes before
we went on the air.

44:21.956 --> 44:25.722
They had shot her in
her stomach five times.

44:28.195 --> 44:32.124
So don't believe everything
that you learn in journalism school,

44:32.134 --> 44:35.934
'cause in war...

44:36.003 --> 44:37.929
what you see

44:37.939 --> 44:39.230
and what really happened

44:39.240 --> 44:42.640
are sometimes two very different things.

44:47.149 --> 44:49.515
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

46:12.502 --> 46:13.694
Simon!

46:13.704 --> 46:16.001
Simon, no! No! No!

46:16.072 --> 46:17.631
Okay? Okay? Come on.

46:17.641 --> 46:19.399
- It's all right.
- You okay?

46:19.409 --> 46:23.243
Wait! Simon, no! Wait!

46:23.312 --> 46:25.862
- Let go!
- No! Simon! Come on!

46:27.316 --> 46:28.875
You fucking shit!

46:28.885 --> 46:31.320
No! No! No!

46:31.388 --> 46:33.821
No! Please, Simon.

46:33.891 --> 46:35.348
Please.

46:35.358 --> 46:37.358
It's okay.

46:48.938 --> 46:50.938
Fuck.

46:52.376 --> 46:54.101
Oh, fuck, man.

46:54.111 --> 46:56.111
I know.

47:40.525 --> 47:42.016
Watch the land mines.

47:42.026 --> 47:44.026
Okay, shut up.

48:12.191 --> 48:14.191
You see that?

48:15.760 --> 48:17.752
What was that? A lookout?

48:17.762 --> 48:19.688
My God, Duck.
I think he's really up there.

48:19.698 --> 48:24.203
They're watching every car
that goes up this mountain.

48:24.369 --> 48:28.109
Hold on, boys.
It's going to be a bumpy ride.

48:41.287 --> 48:43.012
Wait, hold on.

48:43.022 --> 48:45.022
Wait, wait, wait.

48:45.157 --> 48:47.622
Back, back, back, back, back.

48:48.294 --> 48:50.119
You are out of your mind.

48:50.129 --> 48:52.129
Correct.

49:52.994 --> 49:55.714
Where's the welcoming committee?

49:55.729 --> 49:59.724
Be thankful that there aren't
50 Kalashnikovs pointed at our heads.

49:59.734 --> 50:02.224
So what are you going to do?

50:02.303 --> 50:04.195
I'm going to do what
any good journalist would do

50:04.205 --> 50:05.963
when he gets to a new place.

50:05.973 --> 50:08.134
Yeah? What's that?

50:08.209 --> 50:10.249
I'm going to find a bar.

50:53.054 --> 50:55.647
Doesn't exactly look like they get
many newcomers in here.

50:55.657 --> 50:58.547
Just keep smiling. You'll be fine.

51:05.867 --> 51:06.958
What did he say?

51:06.968 --> 51:10.228
He said you're about skinny enough
to be used as bait.

51:10.238 --> 51:14.403
- Yeah. It's a fishing joke.
- Yeah, no. I get it.

51:18.046 --> 51:19.871
Duck, I hope you have money.

51:19.881 --> 51:23.621
What happened to the 20
I gave you yesterday?

51:31.393 --> 51:33.433
Simon, save some for me.

51:57.787 --> 52:00.312
What is he saying?

52:00.388 --> 52:02.823
He just sold you and me out.

52:02.892 --> 52:04.550
- Thank you, Simon.
- Great.

52:04.560 --> 52:06.560
You're welcome.

52:23.546 --> 52:26.806
Do you really think we would
sell out leader of our people

52:26.816 --> 52:29.409
for a simple glass of cheap brandy?

52:29.419 --> 52:34.859
Do you really think the people
of Republica Srpska are that weak?

52:35.258 --> 52:37.984
We don't go University like you people do.

52:37.994 --> 52:42.754
But we are not dumb,
and we don't like to be made fun of.

52:42.798 --> 52:44.424
We are not making fun of you.

52:44.434 --> 52:46.726
Bullshit! You continue even now.

52:46.736 --> 52:49.796
Don't insult me by acting otherwise.

52:51.108 --> 52:52.865
Okay, we don't want any trouble.

52:52.875 --> 52:56.275
You know how I got
these animals on wall?

52:58.115 --> 53:01.049
- I shoot them.
- All right.

53:01.118 --> 53:03.143
We're going to be leaving now.

53:03.153 --> 53:05.153
Yes, I think so.

53:06.523 --> 53:08.348
- One question before we go.
- Simon...

53:08.358 --> 53:11.163
Did you ever go hunting with him?

53:20.305 --> 53:25.867
I mean, uh, he got his nickname
because he loved to hunt foxes.

53:25.943 --> 53:27.668
You obviously love to hunt foxes.

53:27.678 --> 53:29.678
I was just wondering.

53:30.480 --> 53:34.507
In a war, I kill people like you.

53:36.286 --> 53:37.645
The war is over.

53:37.655 --> 53:40.418
Yes, yes, it is.

53:42.393 --> 53:44.393
Wait.

53:46.164 --> 53:47.488
Did you hunt with him?

53:47.498 --> 53:52.428
- For fuck's sake, Simon.
- You are one brave motherfucker.

53:53.238 --> 53:54.529
Hey. Duck.

53:54.539 --> 53:55.997
Duck, look.

53:56.007 --> 53:59.434
You're just like those stupid
United Nations people

53:59.444 --> 54:02.937
that poke around,
seeing if one of us will talk.

54:02.947 --> 54:06.441
You tell your friends
that we know nothing here.

54:06.451 --> 54:09.244
Tell them that we lost loved ones
in the war, too.

54:09.254 --> 54:10.511
Not just the Muslims.

54:10.521 --> 54:12.380
You tell them that.

54:12.390 --> 54:16.810
I make sure you get back down the road
without dying.

54:16.995 --> 54:20.523
Or at least I do my best.

54:20.733 --> 54:22.725
What do you mean, you saw his cars?

54:22.735 --> 54:25.960
While you were back there
being a complete fucking asshole,

54:25.970 --> 54:28.162
Benjamin saw them out the door.

54:28.172 --> 54:29.565
Jesus. Which way did they go?

54:29.575 --> 54:31.133
- Back down the mountain.
- Go!

54:31.143 --> 54:32.634
Get in the car!

54:32.644 --> 54:34.644
Shit! Fuck!

54:42.254 --> 54:44.213
What are we going to do,
run 'em off the road?

54:44.223 --> 54:47.182
- I don't know.
- These men are killers, Simon!

54:47.192 --> 54:49.251
- Fuck these roads!
- Simon.

54:49.261 --> 54:51.153
Kid's got a point.

54:51.163 --> 54:52.521
So does my dick.

54:52.531 --> 54:54.690
What exactly are you planning on doing?

54:54.700 --> 54:56.425
You got three cars that's full of them!

54:56.435 --> 54:58.994
Yeah, I'm going to call
the UN or NATO or someone.

54:59.004 --> 55:01.097
- No fucking calls.
- What the hell?

55:01.107 --> 55:03.065
- You madman! That was my phone!
- No calls!

55:03.075 --> 55:05.115
No NATO! No UN! Nothing!

55:05.145 --> 55:06.935
I don't trust anybody!

55:06.945 --> 55:09.004
- Holy shit.
- Fuck.

55:16.088 --> 55:22.123
Simon, I swear to God, if you do
something stupid, I'll kill you myself.

55:24.463 --> 55:26.488
- Hi.
- Hi. Get out of the car.

55:26.498 --> 55:28.658
No, we're just tourists
on our way to Montenegro.

55:28.668 --> 55:30.560
Yeah, get out of the fucking car now!

55:30.570 --> 55:32.228
Oh, my God.
We're going to fucking die.

55:32.238 --> 55:33.862
- Stay calm.
- Out!

55:33.872 --> 55:36.765
You're making a mistake here
because we're just passing...

55:36.775 --> 55:38.775
On the ground!

55:39.112 --> 55:41.071
- Get the fuck on the ground!
- Just don't panic.

55:41.081 --> 55:43.139
- Shut the fuck up.
- What are you waiting for? Come on.

55:43.149 --> 55:45.841
- No, nothing. Okay. Okay.
- Come on. Come on.

55:45.851 --> 55:48.578
Out. Out. You, too. Out.
Come on. Come on.

55:48.588 --> 55:50.980
- This was all a misunderstanding.
- Shut the fuck up!

55:50.990 --> 55:53.720
On the ground now! Get down.

55:53.793 --> 55:57.108
- On the ground now.
- Okay, okay, okay.

55:57.864 --> 55:59.756
You don't have to worry about us.
We're just journalists!

55:59.766 --> 56:02.316
- You do not have...
- Shut up!

56:08.242 --> 56:10.242
Simon?

56:15.448 --> 56:17.040
Goran? Fucking hell!

56:17.050 --> 56:19.644
Shit. Fucking Simon Hunt!

56:19.719 --> 56:21.311
You know this motherfucker?

56:21.321 --> 56:23.813
Sascha!
Simon Hunt!

56:25.325 --> 56:30.127
Goran, you crazy, thick-necked
Croatian son of a bitch!

56:30.197 --> 56:33.290
- How are you?
- I'm good, I'm good.

56:33.367 --> 56:35.192
- We almost kill you, man.
- Yeah, no shit.

56:35.202 --> 56:37.228
Listen, never drive on our road.

56:37.238 --> 56:39.830
But if you do, call first us, okay?

56:39.840 --> 56:43.070
Okay. All right. I promise. I promise.

56:45.212 --> 56:46.637
Laugh at all their jokes.

56:46.647 --> 56:48.539
Whatever you do, don't stare at the midget.

56:48.549 --> 56:49.707
What midget?

56:49.717 --> 56:51.542
They're black marketeers.

56:51.552 --> 56:53.902
- They run stuff that
comes in through Croatia.

56:53.912 --> 56:54.912
Okay.

56:54.922 --> 56:57.186
- Simon!
- Sascha!

56:57.259 --> 57:01.594
- Oh, shit, I'm staring at the midget.
- Well, stop.

57:06.902 --> 57:09.199
Where the fuck my money?

57:09.270 --> 57:12.500
Beautiful guitar, it's yours.
Go ahead.

57:14.208 --> 57:16.369
Un-fucking-believable.

57:16.444 --> 57:19.249
Yeah, it's, like, twice his size.

57:21.082 --> 57:23.346
Fucking greedy midget.

57:25.720 --> 57:27.720
What?

57:28.957 --> 57:30.415
I'll pay you back.

57:30.425 --> 57:32.425
I'll pay you both back.

57:44.840 --> 57:46.765
<i>- Duck?
- Hey, baby.</i>

57:46.775 --> 57:48.267
Wait, I can hardly hear you.

57:48.277 --> 57:51.236
Costas, can you turn down
the stereo, please?

57:51.246 --> 57:53.438
<i>- Where are you?
- I'm fine.</i>

57:53.448 --> 57:56.083
No. Baby, I said where are you?

57:56.118 --> 57:59.918
<i>Oh, oh, yeah. I'm on Gaspar's boat.</i>

57:59.988 --> 58:01.147
Who is Gaspar?

58:01.157 --> 58:04.050
Costas and Lola's friend.
No, no more champagne.

58:04.060 --> 58:07.053
No, talk to me!
Who is Costas and Lola?

58:07.063 --> 58:09.856
Look baby, I can hardly hear you.

58:09.866 --> 58:11.156
The connection's horrible.

58:11.166 --> 58:12.390
When are you coming?

58:12.400 --> 58:14.494
<i>I'm going to be there tomorrow morning.</i>

58:14.504 --> 58:15.627
First flight out.

58:15.637 --> 58:17.597
<i>Okay. But you better hurry!</i>

58:17.607 --> 58:19.499
Georgio, no! I'm ticklish!

58:19.509 --> 58:22.307
Wait a minute! Who is Georgio?

58:22.377 --> 58:26.072
<i>- You can't slap my butt like that.
- What? No! Put Georgio on the phone!</i>

58:26.082 --> 58:27.974
<i>I want to talk to Georgio!</i>

58:27.984 --> 58:30.214
Hello?

58:46.836 --> 58:48.836
Oh, my God.

58:55.879 --> 58:58.172
So you ran into the midget.

58:58.182 --> 59:00.406
It's better than running over the midget.

59:00.416 --> 59:01.808
And how'd you know?

59:01.818 --> 59:03.777
Look. We cannot talk here.

59:03.787 --> 59:06.778
I didn't know we were talking.

59:06.857 --> 59:08.248
We're not talking.

59:08.258 --> 59:09.916
Well, it looks like we're talking.

59:09.926 --> 59:13.828
Visegrad. Dobran Tunnel,
tonight at 9.

59:13.897 --> 59:15.897
Things are heating up.

59:40.891 --> 59:43.952
Why do you keep breaking into my room?

59:43.962 --> 59:46.187
Look, I'm between places right now.

59:46.197 --> 59:48.197
I needed a bath.

01:00:01.245 --> 01:00:04.985
So what the hell are
you going to do, Simon?

01:00:05.216 --> 01:00:07.108
You're broke.

01:00:07.118 --> 01:00:09.118
You owe midgets.

01:00:12.824 --> 01:00:14.782
I dream about him, Duck.

01:00:14.792 --> 01:00:17.087
I dream about catching him.

01:00:20.565 --> 01:00:23.965
Wiping that arrogant smile off his face.

01:00:24.802 --> 01:00:26.394
My whole fucking situation,

01:00:26.404 --> 01:00:32.099
every bad thing that's ever happened
to me, stems from that bastard.

01:00:32.777 --> 01:00:35.667
I was flying high before that war.

01:00:36.681 --> 01:00:38.681
I know.

01:00:41.519 --> 01:00:43.111
We were a fucking great team.

01:00:43.121 --> 01:00:45.248
The best.

01:00:56.502 --> 01:00:58.967
And then it all went to shit.

01:01:00.606 --> 01:01:04.516
Finding him would've been
so fucking brilliant.

01:01:07.112 --> 01:01:10.741
Maybe you should call your source again.

01:01:15.254 --> 01:01:17.254
What?

01:01:18.891 --> 01:01:20.182
What?

01:01:20.192 --> 01:01:21.784
There is no source.

01:01:21.794 --> 01:01:24.558
I made up the whole story.

01:01:24.630 --> 01:01:26.955
You are un-fucking-believable.

01:01:26.965 --> 01:01:29.425
I heard rumors that
the Fox was up in Celebici.

01:01:29.435 --> 01:01:33.363
I thought if I had a source,
it'd push you over to joining me, so...

01:01:33.373 --> 01:01:36.166
You know, I must be a fucking idiot.

01:01:36.176 --> 01:01:37.900
No, I'm an asshole.

01:01:37.910 --> 01:01:41.071
No, all this time, you've been
making fun of my life in New York.

01:01:41.081 --> 01:01:44.340
Joking about how
I'm not the man that I used to be?

01:01:44.350 --> 01:01:48.210
Let me share something with you, Simon.
You're not the man you used to be, either.

01:01:48.220 --> 01:01:50.600
You are far fucking from it.

01:01:53.059 --> 01:01:57.139
Dry your dick off
and get the fuck outta my room.

01:01:57.864 --> 01:01:59.222
Lady, do you...

01:01:59.232 --> 01:02:02.377
Look, I'm just trying to change my...

01:02:06.773 --> 01:02:08.773
Hello? Hello?

01:02:09.844 --> 01:02:11.844
Yes, I made it up.

01:02:11.878 --> 01:02:14.538
- Shit, Simon.
- We weren't wrong, you know?

01:02:14.548 --> 01:02:16.806
Boris, the UN guy, he thought
we were right on his trail.

01:02:16.816 --> 01:02:20.076
- Yeah, well, he still does.
- What do you mean?

01:02:20.086 --> 01:02:21.678
I just saw him in the lobby,

01:02:21.688 --> 01:02:24.914
and he wants to meet
his favorite CIA hit squad

01:02:24.924 --> 01:02:27.117
at that burnt-out tunnel
in Visegrad tonight.

01:02:27.127 --> 01:02:29.787
- He said, "Things are heating up."
- He did?

01:02:29.797 --> 01:02:32.055
Yes. The whole damn thing
is fucking ridiculous.

01:02:32.065 --> 01:02:36.485
Why the hell didn't you tell me?
We got to get going!

01:02:48.716 --> 01:02:52.456
So at what point do we get
jumped and killed?

01:03:12.174 --> 01:03:14.031
I'm not doing what I'm doing.

01:03:14.041 --> 01:03:16.301
I mean, clearly I'm doing this,
but I'm not doing this,

01:03:16.311 --> 01:03:21.372
because if I was doing this, I could
get into a lot of trouble for doing it.

01:03:21.382 --> 01:03:22.707
What the fuck, Boris?

01:03:22.717 --> 01:03:24.717
Yeah.

01:03:31.526 --> 01:03:33.752
She might seem
young and beautiful to you,

01:03:33.762 --> 01:03:36.721
but she would cut your balls off
and sell them as trinkets

01:03:36.731 --> 01:03:40.386
if she thinks you're fucking
with her. Okay?

01:03:40.702 --> 01:03:42.702
Boris?

01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:46.931
Who are you talking about?

01:03:46.941 --> 01:03:49.901
The person I spoke to about your mission.

01:03:49.911 --> 01:03:51.069
Mirjana.

01:03:51.079 --> 01:03:54.378
She is going to lead you to the Fox.

01:03:54.450 --> 01:03:56.450
Come.

01:04:27.850 --> 01:04:29.850
Sit down.

01:04:39.762 --> 01:04:41.762
Sit.

01:04:56.045 --> 01:04:58.913
I'm no friend of the Muslims.

01:04:58.981 --> 01:05:02.108
Right at the start of the war,
they got some girls from my school.

01:05:02.118 --> 01:05:05.433
Look, it was shitty on all sides, okay?

01:05:06.022 --> 01:05:11.632
You don't know shitty until you've been
gang-raped for seven hours.

01:05:15.765 --> 01:05:19.827
- Where's Boris?
- This is not about justice.

01:05:19.902 --> 01:05:22.429
I am and always will be a proud Serb.

01:05:22.439 --> 01:05:23.864
This is about money.

01:05:23.874 --> 01:05:27.969
My father had a system.
Made us money.

01:05:28.045 --> 01:05:30.470
Then Boghanovic's men took over.

01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:32.480
Wanted what we had.

01:05:33.617 --> 01:05:37.277
Now they run the petrol and cigarettes
coming in from Serbia.

01:05:37.287 --> 01:05:40.654
Use that money to protect him.

01:05:40.724 --> 01:05:44.717
But they killed my father.

01:05:44.795 --> 01:05:46.835
And now we have nothing.

01:05:48.632 --> 01:05:50.725
I hate nothing.

01:05:50.802 --> 01:05:53.694
You stop them,
I get my family business back.

01:05:53.704 --> 01:05:55.429
What do we get?

01:05:55.439 --> 01:05:58.534
What you came to Bosnia to get.

01:06:02.946 --> 01:06:05.005
And how do we do that?

01:06:05.082 --> 01:06:09.315
My old boyfriend, he is one of his guards.

01:06:09.387 --> 01:06:11.446
Midac.

01:06:11.522 --> 01:06:15.088
He is in love with me, calls me every day.

01:06:15.098 --> 01:06:18.286
I have no interest in him anymore,
but I still talk to him

01:06:18.296 --> 01:06:22.631
because I know one day
the CIA will come to my home.

01:06:24.936 --> 01:06:27.200
- How many guards?
- Ten.

01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:31.666
- We're just three.
- Three of you is thirty of them.

01:06:31.676 --> 01:06:35.636
They are fat and lazy and bored
out of their minds in the countryside.

01:06:35.646 --> 01:06:37.638
And you know exactly where he is?

01:06:37.648 --> 01:06:40.709
I can.

01:06:40.785 --> 01:06:43.516
Now you give me thousand marks.

01:06:43.588 --> 01:06:46.948
A thou... Are you out or your fucking mind?

01:06:46.958 --> 01:06:48.850
No. I want goodwill gesture.

01:06:48.860 --> 01:06:51.750
My goodwill has disappeared, lady.

01:06:52.364 --> 01:06:55.595
I risk everything talking to you.

01:06:55.666 --> 01:06:57.760
We just can't.

01:06:58.771 --> 01:07:02.766
I need assurance
you don't take advantage of me.

01:07:08.847 --> 01:07:12.162
If you guys are not serious, forget it.

01:07:16.455 --> 01:07:18.835
The Agency has strict rules.

01:07:19.892 --> 01:07:22.782
We're not authorized for payments.

01:07:26.465 --> 01:07:29.695
Others in the company are, but not us.

01:07:29.735 --> 01:07:33.050
Weaker divisions are.
Smaller divisions.

01:07:33.138 --> 01:07:35.368
You know what we do.

01:07:36.608 --> 01:07:38.535
You know who we are.

01:07:38.545 --> 01:07:43.672
You know our reputations and our accuracy
in achieving our goals around the world.

01:07:43.682 --> 01:07:46.709
A single bullet from us can end wars...

01:07:46.719 --> 01:07:48.110
or start them.

01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:49.746
Now, you're worried
about others killing you,

01:07:49.756 --> 01:07:52.915
but what you should most be worried about
are the three people in this room

01:07:52.925 --> 01:07:54.950
and the reputations
that they bring with them.

01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:57.487
We will do what we need to do
to achieve our goals.

01:07:57.497 --> 01:08:00.290
Right now, you're standing in the way
of us achieving those goals.

01:08:00.300 --> 01:08:04.527
You can help us, and you'll no longer
be hindering our operation.

01:08:04.537 --> 01:08:09.042
You can ignore us,
and I cannot guarantee your safety.

01:08:10.642 --> 01:08:16.846
The Agency is, I'm afraid to say,
completely humorless about these issues.

01:08:28.261 --> 01:08:30.261
Okay.

01:08:32.631 --> 01:08:38.072
Tomorrow, when he call, I will find out
what we all need to know.

01:08:38.270 --> 01:08:39.630
Good.

01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:41.532
Un-fucking-believable, Benji!

01:08:41.542 --> 01:08:43.801
I didn't think you had it in you!

01:08:43.810 --> 01:08:47.705
That's the ballsiest fucking thing
I've ever seen in my life.

01:08:47.715 --> 01:08:49.372
You're a madman.

01:08:49.383 --> 01:08:51.841
I think she's just full of shit
and trying to play us,

01:08:51.852 --> 01:08:53.576
but it's better to find out for sure.

01:08:53.586 --> 01:08:55.712
I don't know what we got
into here, gentlemen,

01:08:55.721 --> 01:08:57.721
but I fucking love it.

01:08:58.826 --> 01:09:02.786
You know, when you think about it,
the whole thing is fucking ridiculous.

01:09:02.796 --> 01:09:04.121
Why?

01:09:04.131 --> 01:09:06.122
I could very well be CIA.

01:09:06.133 --> 01:09:07.791
You can't even spell CIA.

01:09:07.801 --> 01:09:11.529
Every fucking CIA guy I know
looks exactly like me.

01:09:11.538 --> 01:09:13.330
Yeah, only better-looking.

01:09:13.340 --> 01:09:15.332
They certainly do not look like me.

01:09:15.341 --> 01:09:17.167
And that is the genius of it.

01:09:17.178 --> 01:09:20.069
The CIA would have someone
who doesn't look CIA.

01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:22.080
That's...

01:09:22.149 --> 01:09:25.676
That's exactly what they would do.

01:09:28.089 --> 01:09:30.281
- What?
- I think we're being followed.

01:09:30.291 --> 01:09:32.590
- What?
- What do you mean?

01:09:32.661 --> 01:09:38.185
What part of "I think we're being followed"
do you not understand?

01:09:40.535 --> 01:09:42.535
Jesus Christ.

01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:46.531
He's right with me every turn.

01:09:46.541 --> 01:09:48.541
Who could it be?

01:09:53.381 --> 01:09:55.340
- Jesus fucking hell!
- We can't stop.

01:09:55.350 --> 01:09:57.008
We got to get back to Sarajevo.

01:09:57.018 --> 01:09:58.276
Yeah, no shit.

01:09:58.286 --> 01:09:59.610
We got one problem.

01:09:59.620 --> 01:10:01.379
That right turn I made back there?

01:10:01.389 --> 01:10:03.148
We're not heading toward Sarajevo.

01:10:03.158 --> 01:10:05.717
- We're heading toward Pale.
- Oh, God damn it!

01:10:05.727 --> 01:10:07.723
Why? What's Pale?

01:10:07.733 --> 01:10:09.187
Just the worst place we possibly could go.

01:10:09.197 --> 01:10:11.056
It's where the Fox lived during the war.

01:10:11.066 --> 01:10:14.493
- It's just Serb country.
- Fucking peachy.

01:10:14.503 --> 01:10:16.994
- Fucking hell!
- Jesus!

01:10:17.072 --> 01:10:18.463
What's your fucking problem!

01:10:18.473 --> 01:10:21.306
- Shit!
- Okay, okay.

01:10:21.376 --> 01:10:23.376
Fucking shit!

01:10:24.013 --> 01:10:26.478
Speed up! Speed up! Speed up!

01:10:35.358 --> 01:10:37.588
Hold tight! Hold on!

01:10:49.972 --> 01:10:55.412
How come every time I'm with you, Simon,
I put my life in danger?

01:10:56.078 --> 01:10:58.979
Because, my old friend,

01:10:59.048 --> 01:11:03.576
putting your life in danger
is actual living.

01:11:03.653 --> 01:11:05.814
The rest is television.

01:11:05.888 --> 01:11:08.778
You need me to remind you of that.

01:11:18.434 --> 01:11:19.860
We got to be extra careful.

01:11:19.870 --> 01:11:21.561
Don't talk to anyone in the hotel.

01:11:21.571 --> 01:11:24.131
- Don't talk on a cell phone.
- That won't be a problem.

01:11:24.141 --> 01:11:26.133
Trust me, guys, trust me.

01:11:26.143 --> 01:11:28.534
We have stepped into something here.

01:11:28.544 --> 01:11:31.859
People are worried.
People are watching.

01:11:32.448 --> 01:11:35.609
Who the fuck is this guy?
Who the fuck is that guy listening to us?

01:11:35.619 --> 01:11:36.810
Nobody's listening to us!

01:11:36.820 --> 01:11:40.547
What, we got to be afraid
of the hotel help now?

01:11:40.557 --> 01:11:42.557
Trust nobody.

01:11:46.763 --> 01:11:49.908
The only person I don't trust is you.

01:11:59.010 --> 01:12:01.268
Are you sleeping in my room?

01:12:01.278 --> 01:12:04.111
- Yes.
- Well, you kids have fun.

01:12:04.181 --> 01:12:05.639
Look, Simon.

01:12:05.649 --> 01:12:08.164
I mean, I would be lying
if I wasn't secretly...

01:12:08.174 --> 01:12:09.744
hoping all this stuff is true.

01:12:09.754 --> 01:12:12.913
But we're no closer to finding
the Fox than anybody else.

01:12:12.923 --> 01:12:14.923
I mean, Boris is a nut.

01:12:14.958 --> 01:12:16.883
Mirjana's a con artist.

01:12:16.893 --> 01:12:19.319
And that guy following us on the road
is just some drunk

01:12:19.329 --> 01:12:23.324
or your little midget friend
wanting to wrestle.

01:12:24.102 --> 01:12:26.102
You were saying?

01:12:28.539 --> 01:12:30.664
We got to get outta here.

01:12:38.316 --> 01:12:40.441
- Fucking don't move.
- Okay, okay, okay!

01:12:40.451 --> 01:12:42.851
You wanted to find Fox?

01:12:42.920 --> 01:12:45.555
Well, now Fox want to find you.

01:14:19.319 --> 01:14:21.978
I'm sorry. I don't know
what you're saying, okay?

01:14:21.988 --> 01:14:25.648
I'm sorry, I don't understand!
I don't speak your language!

01:14:25.658 --> 01:14:29.819
I don't know what you're saying!
I don't know what you're saying!

01:14:29.829 --> 01:14:31.921
Duck! Duck!
I don't know what he's saying!

01:14:31.931 --> 01:14:34.481
I don't know what he's saying!

01:14:36.135 --> 01:14:37.660
No. No, no, no, no, no.

01:14:37.670 --> 01:14:39.670
We are not CIA.

01:14:44.744 --> 01:14:46.469
I'm sorry. I don't understand
what you're saying.

01:14:46.479 --> 01:14:48.104
We are not CIA!
We are journalists!

01:14:48.114 --> 01:14:50.173
No, we are journalists!

01:14:50.250 --> 01:14:52.643
Duck! Duck, what is he saying?

01:14:52.653 --> 01:14:55.112
I don't understand what you're saying!
We are not CIA!

01:14:55.122 --> 01:14:58.314
Don't! Stop it! Stop it!
I don't know what you're saying!

01:14:58.324 --> 01:15:00.451
Stop it! Stop it!

01:15:48.243 --> 01:15:50.802
The truth emerges.

01:15:58.519 --> 01:16:00.946
There's been a giant mix-up here.

01:16:00.956 --> 01:16:02.747
What mix-up?

01:16:02.757 --> 01:16:05.247
We know everything.

01:16:05.327 --> 01:16:07.852
Especially when CIA is here.

01:16:07.928 --> 01:16:09.253
No, we're not CIA.

01:16:09.263 --> 01:16:11.558
We're really not C... Fuck!

01:16:20.742 --> 01:16:25.162
For weeks we've been hearing rumors
that CIA is here.

01:16:27.282 --> 01:16:30.809
The CIA is coming for me.

01:16:30.886 --> 01:16:32.143
We hear everything.

01:16:32.153 --> 01:16:34.714
We know everything.

01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:36.648
This is the thing. We're not CIA.

01:16:36.658 --> 01:16:38.718
We're just journalists.

01:16:38.793 --> 01:16:40.118
Just journalists. We just came...

01:16:40.128 --> 01:16:42.622
We were trying to get
an interview with you.

01:16:42.632 --> 01:16:45.624
But you tell others that you are CIA.

01:16:45.634 --> 01:16:48.960
No! No, no, we didn't.
We didn't say anything...

01:16:48.970 --> 01:16:50.970
You said to Boris.

01:16:52.975 --> 01:16:55.233
No. We didn't. We didn't say that.

01:16:55.243 --> 01:16:57.269
He was just really confused.

01:16:57.279 --> 01:16:59.705
We're really just journalists.

01:16:59.715 --> 01:17:02.809
And we're not here to hurt you.

01:17:11.595 --> 01:17:14.063
Srdjan.

01:17:27.844 --> 01:17:29.844
No, no, no!

01:17:30.012 --> 01:17:32.810
Oh, no, please don't do it!

01:17:32.883 --> 01:17:34.883
You can't do it.

01:17:34.950 --> 01:17:37.943
<i># You #</i>

01:17:38.021 --> 01:17:42.924
<i># You make me feel brand-new #</i>

01:17:42.993 --> 01:17:46.986
- Hello?
- You got to be fucking kidding me.

01:18:13.090 --> 01:18:14.181
Fox!

01:18:14.191 --> 01:18:16.650
Fox went out the back!
He's out the back!

01:18:16.660 --> 01:18:18.286
Move in!

01:18:18.296 --> 01:18:20.296
Guys, move it!

01:18:45.590 --> 01:18:50.010
<i>Extraction team 107,
this is Firebase Lima. Stand by.</i>

01:18:56.067 --> 01:18:57.658
Look, this is a news event.

01:18:57.668 --> 01:18:59.026
We are newsmen.

01:18:59.036 --> 01:19:01.331
We want off the copter now.

01:19:02.141 --> 01:19:07.751
- You ever heard of freedom of the press?
- Not in Bosnia, sir, no.

01:19:09.680 --> 01:19:13.335
All right. Jazzy, let's start this bird up.

01:19:15.788 --> 01:19:18.678
Wait. Where are we going, exactly?

01:19:27.498 --> 01:19:30.388
Hey, excuse me. Did you catch him?

01:19:31.869 --> 01:19:34.419
That's classified information.

01:19:36.775 --> 01:19:38.167
Classified.

01:19:38.177 --> 01:19:40.177
Correct. Classified.

01:19:40.212 --> 01:19:43.442
So you're saying you didn't catch him?

01:19:44.216 --> 01:19:46.511
He was right fucking there!

01:19:46.552 --> 01:19:48.844
Just what are you insinuating?

01:19:48.854 --> 01:19:51.079
I was an inch... an inch from this guy!

01:19:51.089 --> 01:19:52.214
He was there!

01:19:52.224 --> 01:19:55.051
We saved your life.
That was our mission.

01:19:55.061 --> 01:19:57.152
You cut it pretty close, don't you think?

01:19:57.162 --> 01:20:01.156
We did our job. Now you guys
got to get the hell out of this country.

01:20:01.166 --> 01:20:05.260
No. No, I think there's a pretty good story
to tell inside this country.

01:20:05.270 --> 01:20:10.455
I was nose-to-nose with the most wanted
fugitive in the world.

01:20:12.945 --> 01:20:16.005
Let me tell you something, Mr. Cunt.

01:20:16.583 --> 01:20:18.778
- Hunt.
- Mr. Hunt.

01:20:18.851 --> 01:20:21.511
You're lucky I haven't already
arrested your sorry ass

01:20:21.521 --> 01:20:25.013
and thrown you in a dark fucking hole
with no fucking exits.

01:20:25.023 --> 01:20:26.582
Arrested for what?

01:20:26.592 --> 01:20:29.452
Impersonating a CIA officer
is a serious offense.

01:20:29.462 --> 01:20:33.899
Jesus fuck.
We never impersonated anyone.

01:20:33.967 --> 01:20:39.028
Your friend Boris is on a plane for Uganda
where he will now be stationed.

01:20:39.038 --> 01:20:41.698
But before he was suddenly
transferred to darkest Africa

01:20:41.708 --> 01:20:43.466
to never be heard from again,

01:20:43.476 --> 01:20:47.726
we confronted him
about your little representation.

01:20:49.415 --> 01:20:51.307
If I ever hear from you again,

01:20:51.317 --> 01:20:55.311
the CIA will be on you like a cheap suit
from the Men's Wearhouse.

01:20:55.321 --> 01:20:57.881
You'll be arrested, jailed,

01:20:57.958 --> 01:21:01.986
and sodomized by a big, dumb,
large-cocked Serbian bastard

01:21:01.996 --> 01:21:04.521
for the rest of your shitty little lives.

01:21:04.531 --> 01:21:07.992
And if you don't care about that,
if you like big Serbian cock,

01:21:08.002 --> 01:21:10.261
and you still plan
on reporting any of this,

01:21:10.271 --> 01:21:12.896
then your friend Boris
will find himself eaten

01:21:12.906 --> 01:21:16.603
by a tiger or lion or a squirrel

01:21:16.677 --> 01:21:20.237
or whatever fucking animal
we can find in darkest Africa.

01:21:20.247 --> 01:21:22.106
And you'll have to live with that.

01:21:22.116 --> 01:21:26.536
I assume that I can quote you
on the squirrel remark.

01:21:28.055 --> 01:21:30.455
Look, Cunt.

01:21:30.524 --> 01:21:33.884
The CIA has a bright side,
the CIA has a dark side,

01:21:33.894 --> 01:21:36.120
and then there's the gray side.

01:21:36.130 --> 01:21:38.956
We do the things that people
don't need to know about.

01:21:38.966 --> 01:21:41.392
It's a part we deny even exists.

01:21:41.402 --> 01:21:44.051
It's a part of the CIA
that's been working for...

01:21:44.061 --> 01:21:46.330
the last three weeks in Bosnia on the Fox.

01:21:46.340 --> 01:21:49.968
And what have you been working on doing,
letting him disappear?

01:21:49.978 --> 01:21:51.936
Let me ask you a question.

01:21:51.946 --> 01:21:55.472
Why do you think the CIA
would want to let a war criminal go?

01:21:55.482 --> 01:21:57.242
Let me ask you a question.

01:21:57.252 --> 01:21:59.981
In five years, why has the CIA,

01:22:00.055 --> 01:22:03.957
the Hague, the United Nations, and NATO

01:22:04.024 --> 01:22:08.252
not been able to find a guy
that we found in just two days

01:22:08.262 --> 01:22:11.255
if you actually wanted to find him?

01:22:21.409 --> 01:22:23.468
We're giving you a one-way ticket home.

01:22:23.478 --> 01:22:25.003
I suggest you use it.

01:22:25.013 --> 01:22:27.903
We're not saving your asses again.

01:22:28.149 --> 01:22:32.909
From this moment on,
the story's being written by others.

01:22:59.148 --> 01:23:01.306
The Americans, yeah,
they brokered the peace agreement,

01:23:01.316 --> 01:23:04.542
but some would suggest they
made a secret deal with the Fox,

01:23:04.552 --> 01:23:10.927
that if he stepped down from power
they would not arrest him for war crimes.

01:23:24.941 --> 01:23:27.833
You ever flown in
one of these puppies before?

01:23:27.843 --> 01:23:30.469
You won't have feeling
in your ass for a week.

01:23:30.479 --> 01:23:33.794
- Great.
- It's nice they packed for us.

01:23:33.849 --> 01:23:35.809
So what are you going to do?

01:23:35.819 --> 01:23:39.050
I don't know.
Go to Greece with Duck.

01:23:39.121 --> 01:23:43.116
Share some moussaka
with him and his girlfriend.

01:23:44.794 --> 01:23:46.794
Duck?

01:23:48.197 --> 01:23:50.089
Duck?

01:23:50.099 --> 01:23:52.099
What is it?

01:23:56.540 --> 01:23:58.999
They sent Boris out of this country

01:23:59.009 --> 01:24:03.139
because he was actually
trying to catch the Fox.

01:24:03.213 --> 01:24:05.605
They're sending us away
because we found him.

01:24:05.615 --> 01:24:07.974
No, he found us.
We're lucky we still have our heads.

01:24:07.984 --> 01:24:11.344
No, it's like no one in a position
of power in this place

01:24:11.354 --> 01:24:13.980
even wants to try and catch that bastard.

01:24:13.990 --> 01:24:15.348
And that's just wrong.

01:24:15.358 --> 01:24:17.849
Yeah.

01:24:17.928 --> 01:24:19.928
What are you saying?

01:24:20.797 --> 01:24:23.527
I'm saying we can't leave.

01:24:30.741 --> 01:24:32.951
I think I just wet myself.

01:24:46.858 --> 01:24:48.783
All right.

01:24:48.793 --> 01:24:50.318
Yeah.

01:24:50.328 --> 01:24:52.220
Yeah, let's go get this bastard.

01:24:52.230 --> 01:24:56.394
<i>Okay, gentlemen, load 'em up.
We're ready to go.</i>

01:24:58.235 --> 01:24:59.861
<i>Prepare plane for taxi.</i>

01:24:59.871 --> 01:25:02.863
All right, um, what's the plan?

01:25:04.876 --> 01:25:06.876
Run.

01:25:08.045 --> 01:25:09.904
Run? That's your plan?

01:25:09.914 --> 01:25:11.914
Yeah. Run.

01:25:24.195 --> 01:25:25.753
<i>As a kid I never dreamed</i>

01:25:25.763 --> 01:25:28.755
<i>about being an action hero.</i>

01:25:28.834 --> 01:25:34.204
<i>But, as Boris said, in dirty times,
dirty deeds need to be done.</i>

01:25:36.408 --> 01:25:41.107
<i>The rest of the story,
I guess, is urban legend.</i>

01:25:41.179 --> 01:25:46.550
<i>I'd tell you it was true,
but you'd never believe me anyway.</i>

01:25:47.853 --> 01:25:52.586
<i>Mirjana did find out
where the Fox was hiding,</i>

01:25:52.658 --> 01:25:57.252
<i>and that gave us the idea of how
the three of us could catch him.</i>

01:25:57.262 --> 01:26:01.425
<i>You see, you can't go hunting
with ten bodyguards.</i>

01:26:01.435 --> 01:26:03.025
<i>It's too noisy.</i>

01:26:03.035 --> 01:26:05.663
<i>It scares off the animals.</i>

01:26:44.010 --> 01:26:46.376
Doctor?

01:27:58.652 --> 01:28:01.986
Where is the rest of your team?

01:28:03.724 --> 01:28:06.217
There ain't no team, you motherfucker.

01:28:06.227 --> 01:28:08.227
It's just us.

01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:16.328
I get you $5 million.

01:28:16.404 --> 01:28:19.339
United States currency.

01:28:19.406 --> 01:28:23.036
Take it. It's yours.

01:28:23.111 --> 01:28:26.571
We get $5 million just for turning you in.

01:28:26.581 --> 01:28:29.778
You turn me in, and then what?

01:28:29.851 --> 01:28:34.220
They are more afraid of me
than I am of them.

01:28:36.825 --> 01:28:40.591
You do not have the balls to kill me.

01:28:40.662 --> 01:28:44.962
And you do not have the balls
to take my money.

01:28:45.034 --> 01:28:46.826
And you do not have the balls

01:28:46.836 --> 01:28:49.227
to see what the international community

01:28:49.237 --> 01:28:53.196
will do or not do to me.

01:28:53.274 --> 01:28:56.300
You have nothing.

01:28:58.513 --> 01:29:02.244
That's why we've got to change the rules.

01:29:26.909 --> 01:29:31.904
If the power comes back on,
it still doesn't mean you can leave.

01:29:31.914 --> 01:29:33.873
I'm never leaving.

01:29:33.883 --> 01:29:39.253
I'll have myself surgically
attached to you.

01:29:55.004 --> 01:29:56.897
This was Marda's town.

01:29:56.907 --> 01:30:00.902
It's one of the few places
Muslims came back to.

01:30:02.978 --> 01:30:06.573
They'll know best what to do with him.

01:31:27.164 --> 01:31:28.389
Let me borrow 50 bucks.

01:31:28.399 --> 01:31:31.359
What? We just left $5 million
tied to the side of the road.

01:31:31.369 --> 01:31:32.961
You want to borrow 50 bucks?

01:31:32.971 --> 01:31:34.962
Actually, make it a hundred.

01:31:34.972 --> 01:31:36.464
You know, when all this hits,

01:31:36.474 --> 01:31:39.634
it's going to be a shit-storm of
international denial and cover-ups.

01:31:39.644 --> 01:31:42.471
Maybe you could talk to your father,
get me that gig to report it.

01:31:42.481 --> 01:31:44.238
Then I can pay you back.

01:31:44.248 --> 01:31:46.248
All right.

01:31:51.557 --> 01:31:53.482
So what are you going to do?

01:31:53.492 --> 01:31:55.350
You going to stay and cover it?

01:31:55.360 --> 01:31:57.286
Are you?

01:31:57.296 --> 01:32:00.493
I got the cushy gig in New York.

01:32:00.566 --> 01:32:02.659
The girl in Greece.

01:32:02.734 --> 01:32:04.126
The story...

01:32:04.136 --> 01:32:07.970
The story's going to be right here.

01:32:09.274 --> 01:32:12.868
Just play something
decent on this, will you?

01:32:12.878 --> 01:32:14.878
For once?

01:32:15.948 --> 01:32:19.107
Simon, you're the only man I know
who would borrow money

01:32:19.117 --> 01:32:22.678
to repay a debt that you
took to repay a debt.

01:32:22.688 --> 01:32:26.125
And that's why you love me.

01:32:28.193 --> 01:32:30.525
That's why I love you.

01:32:52.251 --> 01:32:55.311
<i># I fought the law, and the law won #</i>

01:32:55.321 --> 01:32:58.466
<i># I fought the law, and the law won #</i>

01:33:00.467 --> 01:33:02.967
