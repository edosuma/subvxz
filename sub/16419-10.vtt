00:11.275 --> 00:12.551
- You can't catch me!

00:12.620 --> 00:13.940
- You can run,
but you can't hide.

00:13.965 --> 00:15.620
- Ha ha! You missed!

00:15.689 --> 00:17.103
- Oh yeah?!

00:17.172 --> 00:19.206
I am unpoppable! Ahhh!

00:19.275 --> 00:21.000
- Yeah! What about that son?!?

00:21.068 --> 00:22.137
Watch out.

00:27.827 --> 00:29.344
- No way... you don't like Oscar?

00:29.413 --> 00:30.896
How could you not like Oscar?

00:30.965 --> 00:32.275
- I don't dislike him.

00:32.344 --> 00:34.551
I just think he needs
to improve his attitude.

00:34.620 --> 00:36.655
- Oh come on...
He lives in a garbage can.

00:36.724 --> 00:38.379
He has every right
to be grouchy.

00:39.275 --> 00:40.448
- Get back here Hudson!

00:40.517 --> 00:42.241
Argh!

00:44.896 --> 00:47.068
- What are you guys doing?

00:47.137 --> 00:49.206
- Oh! We're just tryin'
out a new game idea.

00:49.275 --> 00:50.896
- We call it...

00:50.965 --> 00:53.275
"Looney Ballooney."

00:54.172 --> 00:55.241
- Looney?

00:55.310 --> 00:56.896
- Ballooney?

00:56.965 --> 00:58.241
- Yeah, see, as the player,

00:58.310 --> 01:01.068
my goal is to chase Balloon Boy

01:01.137 --> 01:02.793
all around the barnyard...

01:02.862 --> 01:04.517
- and he uses those weapons

01:04.586 --> 01:06.241
to try and pop my balloons.

01:07.896 --> 01:10.137
- Ohhhh okay.

01:10.206 --> 01:11.734
Hey... hey, you know
who'd love that game?

01:11.758 --> 01:12.689
- Unh-uh.

01:12.758 --> 01:14.103
- Neither do I.

01:15.827 --> 01:16.758
- Uh, excuse me.

01:16.827 --> 01:18.034
- Oh hi.

01:18.103 --> 01:20.344
- Our bathrooms are not
open to the public.

01:21.551 --> 01:23.034
Oh, I don't need a restroom.

01:23.103 --> 01:25.413
- You will eventually.

01:25.482 --> 01:28.103
- Well I hope so.

01:28.172 --> 01:29.103
But actually,
I'm lookin' for uh...

01:29.172 --> 01:30.896
- Wha... Wait a second...

01:30.965 --> 01:31.965
Jordan?!?

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
- Triple G?

01:33.068 --> 01:34.068
- Ahhhh!
- Ha ha!

01:34.137 --> 01:35.206
- Oh!

01:35.275 --> 01:36.562

01:36.586 --> 01:38.241
- Ahh!

01:38.310 --> 01:40.965
- I'm guessing
they've met before.

01:41.034 --> 01:42.034
- Heck yeah!

01:42.068 --> 01:43.310
This is my Uncle Jordan.

01:43.379 --> 01:44.586
- I'm Double G's brother.

01:44.655 --> 01:47.000
- Oh, that makes sense.
- Ah, siblings.

01:47.068 --> 01:49.103
- Oh uh, that's Babe and Kenzie,

01:49.172 --> 01:50.206
and that's Hudson.

01:50.275 --> 01:51.424
- Hey.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

01:51.448 --> 01:53.137
- Pardon my balloons.

01:54.241 --> 01:55.724
- That's all right.

01:55.793 --> 01:58.379
I just came by to give
you a little somethin'.

01:58.448 --> 02:01.310
- Ooh, let's see...

Wh-what?
You're gettin' married?!?

02:03.034 --> 02:04.413
- Yeeeaaahh.

02:04.482 --> 02:05.517
She liked it,

02:05.586 --> 02:07.034
so she put a ring on it.

02:07.103 --> 02:09.241
Ahahah!

02:09.310 --> 02:10.793
- So uh, where ya

02:10.862 --> 02:12.172

02:12.241 --> 02:15.172
in the main courtyard
of the Chambrulay.

02:15.241 --> 02:16.965
- Ohhh!
- Oooh...

02:17.034 --> 02:19.241
- I've always wanted
to go to The Hamptons.

02:19.310 --> 02:20.413
- Uh, yeah, me too.

02:20.482 --> 02:22.793
- Oh! Ya lucky duck.

02:22.862 --> 02:24.241
- Well, if you'd all
like to come,

02:24.310 --> 02:25.931
my fiancée and I
would be honored

02:26.000 --> 02:28.172
to have all the Game Shakers
attend our wedding.

02:28.241 --> 02:29.724
- Seriously?
- Oh no way!

02:29.793 --> 02:30.793
- Oh, my god!

02:30.827 --> 02:31.827
- That's awesome!

02:31.896 --> 02:32.896
And we can have my dad

02:32.931 --> 02:33.941
fly us all in his helicopter

02:33.965 --> 02:35.758
- NOOO!!!

02:38.551 --> 02:39.551
- I'm sorry Trip,

02:39.586 --> 02:41.931
but your father is not invited.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.034
- But he's your brother.

02:43.103 --> 02:44.275
- You can't not invite

02:44.344 --> 02:46.000
your own brother
to your wedding.

02:46.068 --> 02:48.241
- I can if I hate him.

02:48.310 --> 02:49.620
- Well yeah, then you can.

02:50.931 --> 02:52.931
- What did Dub do
to make you hate him?

02:53.000 --> 02:54.448
- Oh not much.

02:54.517 --> 02:55.965
He just took all my dreams

02:56.034 --> 02:57.896
and wazzed all over them.

03:00.137 --> 03:01.965
- How?

03:02.034 --> 03:04.482
- See, before my dad
became a solo artist,

03:04.551 --> 03:06.482
he was a part
of a family musical group,

03:06.551 --> 03:07.793
called The Griffin Brothers.

03:07.862 --> 03:09.172
- That's right.

03:09.241 --> 03:11.103
It was all four of us brothers:

03:11.172 --> 03:13.793
me, Dub...

03:13.862 --> 03:16.379
Avis, and Corky.

03:16.448 --> 03:17.379

our first big break

06:42.931 --> 06:44.551
Do you know that
my rotten brother Jordan

06:44.620 --> 06:45.551
is gettin' married?!?

06:45.620 --> 06:47.275
To a woman?!?

06:47.344 --> 06:48.655
And he didn't invite us?!?

06:49.655 --> 06:51.379
- You want a lamb chop?!?

06:51.448 --> 06:53.586
- No, I don't want no lamb chop!

06:53.655 --> 06:56.344
Why would I... dih, ah!

06:56.413 --> 06:58.813
- How could your Uncle Jordan
not invite us to his weddin'?!?

07:00.413 --> 07:04.068
He uh... he did invite me.

07:04.137 --> 07:05.458
- W-w-wait...
Jordan invited you?!?

07:05.482 --> 07:06.620
- Yes sir.

07:06.689 --> 07:07.620
- And me.

07:07.689 --> 07:09.068
- I was also invited.

07:09.137 --> 07:10.068
- What you?!?

07:10.137 --> 07:11.931
Man! Give me this!

07:12.000 --> 07:13.586
It's mine!

07:14.931 --> 07:16.044
- Tell me why my own brother

07:16.068 --> 07:17.348
does not want me
at his weddin'?!

07:17.413 --> 07:18.758
- 'Cuz when you were kids,

07:18.827 --> 07:20.103
you ruined his music career.

07:20.172 --> 07:22.551
- He says you wazzed
all over his dreams.

07:22.620 --> 07:25.620
- Awww, so?!?

07:25.689 --> 07:27.620
- Well, I think we're
beginning to see why

07:27.689 --> 07:30.172
he might've left you
off the invite list.

07:30.241 --> 07:31.310
- You know what...

07:31.379 --> 07:32.665
You know what?!
You-you know what?!?

07:32.689 --> 07:34.586
You know! You know...

07:40.758 --> 07:41.689
- Dub...
- Dad?

07:41.758 --> 07:42.689
- What's wrong?

07:42.758 --> 07:44.310
- It's just that...

07:44.379 --> 07:47.241
my own brother
doesn't want me at his wedding.

07:47.310 --> 07:49.034
And that hurts me.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.241
- So, this is what
it sounds like...

07:59.310 --> 08:01.172
when Dub cries.

08:08.620 --> 08:09.620
- Okay people,

08:09.689 --> 08:11.379
let's rehearse this again,

08:11.448 --> 08:12.896
and maybe try to get it right.

08:12.965 --> 08:14.034
Okay...

08:14.103 --> 08:15.310
Music!

08:18.206 --> 08:19.551

- Nah, nah...

08:21.620 --> 08:23.206
You wanna buy some sod?

08:24.689 --> 08:26.931
- And step slowly...

08:28.896 --> 08:30.965
- Oh good, there's your uncle.

08:31.034 --> 08:32.620
- Yep, let's go talk to him.

08:33.793 --> 08:36.172
- Hudson, you wait here.

08:36.241 --> 08:38.034

at lotsa weddings.

09:01.206 --> 09:02.689
- Ah...

09:02.758 --> 09:04.068
But never a bride.

09:05.448 --> 09:06.517
- Well... no.

09:06.586 --> 09:07.586
Not yet.

09:07.620 --> 09:08.655
- Mmm.

09:08.724 --> 09:10.413
I bet that's frustrating.

09:13.241 --> 09:14.482
- Nooo.

09:14.551 --> 09:15.931
- Come on, please?!?
- Why?

09:16.000 --> 09:17.448
You know if I invite your dad,

09:17.517 --> 09:19.620
he's gonna show up here
and steal the spotlight

09:19.689 --> 09:20.965
away from me and my bride!

09:21.034 --> 09:22.474
- What if we swear
that won't happen?

09:22.517 --> 09:25.344
- Yeah! If you let Dub come,
we promise to make sure

09:25.413 --> 09:27.000
you barely even know he's here.

09:28.206 --> 09:29.896
- But Double G
always ruins everything.

09:29.965 --> 09:31.275
- Come on, it's a wedding.

09:31.344 --> 09:33.758
It's a time for family
to be together,

09:33.827 --> 09:36.206
to celebrate and eat chicken.

09:36.275 --> 09:37.724
Or salmon...

09:37.793 --> 09:39.758
or the vegetarian option.

09:42.034 --> 09:43.517
- Oh all right, Dub can come.

09:43.586 --> 09:44.965
- Yay!

09:45.034 --> 09:46.517
- Ahhh! Don't hug me.

09:46.586 --> 09:47.931
Just buy some sod.

10:01.689 --> 10:03.034
- Okay guys, come on,

10:03.103 --> 10:04.182
let's take a selfie of us
before we go.

10:04.206 --> 10:06.896
- Yeah, wedding selfie! Woooo!

10:08.034 --> 10:09.251
- And we can use
my new selfie stick!

10:09.275 --> 10:10.795
- Whatever, let's just
hurry and do it.

10:10.827 --> 10:12.275
- All right Kenz, get over...

10:12.344 --> 10:14.044
- Yep so you'll stand right here
and I'll stand..

10:14.068 --> 10:15.596
- Will you fix my hair?
- Here, you can use my phone.

10:15.620 --> 10:17.862
- Okay! And I'll just
snap it onto my selfie stick...

10:17.931 --> 10:20.241
- Give it to me,
I take the best pics.

10:21.724 --> 10:23.172
- Yes, you press
the button better.

10:25.551 --> 10:26.655
- Ready?

10:26.724 --> 10:28.172
One, two, three...

10:28.241 --> 10:29.172
OWWWWWWWW!!!

10:29.241 --> 10:30.344
- Oh... oh! Whoah!

10:33.172 --> 10:34.931
It's okay,
my phone didn't break.

10:36.758 --> 10:38.379
- And look...

10:38.448 --> 10:39.931
It got a great pic of Kenzie,

10:40.000 --> 10:41.379
just before it smacked her.

10:44.482 --> 10:45.758
- Hahahaha!

10:45.827 --> 10:47.387
- Give me the phone
I wanna see the pic.

10:50.448 --> 10:51.931
- Hey hey!

10:52.000 --> 10:54.379
Check out Double G's
specially-designed tuxedo!

10:57.034 --> 10:58.068
- Whoah!

10:58.137 --> 10:59.344
- No no no no...

10:59.413 --> 11:01.344
- Unh-uh, no sir.

11:01.413 --> 11:03.172
- I love it.

11:03.241 --> 11:05.586
- Ah, what are
you all grousin' about?

11:05.655 --> 11:07.517
- Um, do you not remember

11:07.586 --> 11:09.655
the conversation we had
with you last night?

11:09.724 --> 11:11.000
- I thought we were clear.

11:11.068 --> 11:13.517
- You promised to
lay low at the wedding.

11:13.586 --> 11:14.620
- I know that.

11:14.689 --> 11:15.758
- Well then maybe

11:15.827 --> 11:17.413
you shouldn't be
wearing a tuxedo

11:17.482 --> 11:19.310
that's visible from Jupiter!

11:20.965 --> 11:22.758
- And why'd you bring her
as your date?!?

11:22.827 --> 11:25.034
- Oh, 'cuz her name's Graciella!

11:25.103 --> 11:28.068
That's Italian
for daaaaaaaaaaaaang.

11:29.655 --> 11:32.310
- Well you can't take a lady
like that to this wedding!

11:32.379 --> 11:34.931
- She'll make the bride
look like dog food!

11:35.793 --> 11:36.862
- Ah, fine!

11:36.931 --> 11:38.551
Darlin' I'm sorry,

11:38.620 --> 11:40.460
but you're gonna'
have to go ahead and go home.

11:42.241 --> 11:44.310
- Here, I'll show you
to the door, Dang.

11:47.689 --> 11:50.137
- Ahhhh! Are ya happy?

11:50.206 --> 11:52.000
Now I gotta go to
my brother's weddin' alone.

11:52.068 --> 11:53.689
- No, no, you can bring a date.

11:53.758 --> 11:55.896
- As long as she blends in.

11:55.965 --> 11:58.620
- Well my brother's wedding
starts in two hours.

11:58.689 --> 12:00.517
Where am I gonna find some...

12:00.586 --> 12:02.448
Oh, wait a minute, uh...

12:02.517 --> 12:04.310
Hey! Hey you!

12:04.379 --> 12:05.724
- Me?

12:05.793 --> 12:08.103
- Yeah, you wanna go
to a weddin' with Double G?

12:09.000 --> 12:10.310
- Yes, please!

12:11.827 --> 12:13.275
- Oh, hey, hey, hey, no, hey...

12:13.344 --> 12:15.024
Don't be touchin' me
with that window dirt.

12:20.310 --> 12:21.517
- And Debra...

12:21.586 --> 12:22.734
do you take Jordan
to be your husband...

12:22.758 --> 12:24.758
in sickness and in health...

12:24.827 --> 12:27.551
in good times and bad...

12:27.620 --> 12:30.172
fit or fat...

12:30.241 --> 12:32.275
so long as you both shall live?

12:32.344 --> 12:34.413
- I do.

12:34.482 --> 12:36.517
- Then, as it was
in olden times...

12:36.586 --> 12:38.689
- I'm very proud of you.

12:38.758 --> 12:39.931
- Yeah, what'd I do?

12:40.000 --> 12:41.689
- You've been so well-behaved.

12:41.758 --> 12:43.068
- Yeah yeah yeah.

12:44.275 --> 12:45.793
- Uh uh, no! None a'that.

12:47.517 --> 12:49.448
- and so you may kiss the bride,

12:49.517 --> 12:51.344
with your mouth closed.

13:03.172 --> 13:04.965
- Well, that was
a lovely ceremony.

13:05.034 --> 13:06.551
- So beautiful.

13:06.620 --> 13:08.586
- Yeah, and this is
the first wedding I've been to

13:08.655 --> 13:10.448
where all the guests
get a free bag a'sod.

13:12.793 --> 13:13.793
- Oh, no no... ma'am...

13:13.862 --> 13:15.517
you shouldn't eat the sod.

13:18.620 --> 13:21.241
- Hey, why do you
keep looking up at the sky?

13:21.310 --> 13:24.551
- 'Cuz. It's about to rain.

13:27.344 --> 13:29.896
- Uh, heh... I don't think
it's gonna rain.

13:29.965 --> 13:31.448
- Oh. You wanna bet...

13:31.517 --> 13:34.000
a million dollars?

13:35.931 --> 13:37.034
- He's doing the laugh,

13:37.103 --> 13:38.448
that's his mischievous laugh.

13:39.862 --> 13:40.931
- Dub, what are you up to?

13:41.000 --> 13:42.241
- Well...

13:42.310 --> 13:44.448
Bunny and Ruthless
are on the way here

13:44.517 --> 13:47.827
with my big surprise
wedding present for Jordan

13:47.896 --> 13:49.096
and that lady he just married!

13:51.379 --> 13:54.758
- Dub, you tell us what
your present is right now.

13:54.827 --> 13:56.344
- All right! Come here...

13:56.413 --> 13:58.275
Bunny and Ruthless
are on the way here,

13:58.344 --> 14:01.137
with a million dollars in cash!

14:01.206 --> 14:02.517
That's my present for Jordan.

14:03.758 --> 14:05.068
- Aw Dad!

14:05.137 --> 14:06.448
- See, that's why your brother

14:06.517 --> 14:08.000
didn't invite you
in the first place.

14:08.068 --> 14:09.108
- He was afraid you'd come

14:09.137 --> 14:10.448
and do something all crazy,

14:10.517 --> 14:12.551
and take the attention
away from him.

14:12.620 --> 14:14.620
- Ah, you all
don't know anything.

14:14.689 --> 14:15.896
- Oh we don't?

14:15.965 --> 14:17.482
- No! I mean, what person

14:17.551 --> 14:19.241
would not wanna
look up in the sky

14:19.310 --> 14:21.655
and see a million dollars
comin' down at 'em.

14:21.724 --> 14:24.137
- Look, I'm not saying that
people wouldn't want a...

14:26.172 --> 14:27.862
What-what do you mean,
up in the sky?

14:42.241 --> 14:45.068
- How long 'til we're
right over the wedding?

14:45.137 --> 14:47.793
- Uhhh... about six minutes.

14:47.862 --> 14:49.275
We better get the money ready.

14:49.344 --> 14:50.482
- Okay!

15:06.344 --> 15:08.172
- I don't see why
this is a problem!

15:08.241 --> 15:09.551
- Wh... are you kiddin' me?!?

15:09.620 --> 15:11.206
- When you're at
a person's wedding,

15:11.275 --> 15:13.172
you don't have your
private jet fly over

15:13.241 --> 15:15.000
and dump
a million dollars on it!

15:15.931 --> 15:17.517
- Especially this wedding!

15:17.586 --> 15:19.965
- Ah, whyyy?

15:20.034 --> 15:21.379
- 'Cuz we promised your brother

15:21.448 --> 15:23.241
that if you came here,
you would lay low.

15:23.310 --> 15:25.137
- Which means not
take the attention

15:25.206 --> 15:26.517
away from him and his bride.

15:26.586 --> 15:28.827
- Well I turned off
my tuxedo lights!

15:28.896 --> 15:31.275
A-and I got rid of that girl
I was gonna bring,

15:31.344 --> 15:34.068
and brought this one instead!

15:34.137 --> 15:35.310
- Hehe...

15:35.379 --> 15:37.379
Do you like my
mustard colored hat?

15:37.448 --> 15:38.827
- No!

15:38.896 --> 15:41.000
And quit eatin' that sod!

15:41.068 --> 15:42.586
Give me... ahh...

15:44.310 --> 15:46.413
- Oh, why not just
let her eat the sod?

15:48.000 --> 15:49.620
Narla!

15:49.689 --> 15:51.551
Sweety, you can eat the sod!

15:51.620 --> 15:53.344
- Hehehe...

15:53.413 --> 15:54.689
sod...

15:57.241 --> 15:58.448
- All right, all right,

15:58.517 --> 16:00.000
just tell me what
you want me to do.

16:00.068 --> 16:02.034
- We want you to call
Bunny and Ruthless

16:02.103 --> 16:03.586
and tell 'em not
to drop the money.

16:03.655 --> 16:05.000
- Ah fine.

16:05.068 --> 16:06.896
If you all think
it's gonna be so bad...

16:06.965 --> 16:09.137
- Hey Gale... Gale.

16:09.206 --> 16:10.724
Me and Debra want you and Trip

16:10.793 --> 16:12.965
to come take some pictures
with the family.

16:13.034 --> 16:14.275
- Who's Debra?

16:14.344 --> 16:16.103
- Ahh geez.
- Oh Dad!

16:16.172 --> 16:17.551
- My new wife.

16:17.620 --> 16:19.137
- Oh yeah yeah.

16:19.206 --> 16:21.379
She's very special.

16:21.448 --> 16:22.458
- Oh uh, wait,
my dad needs to make

16:22.482 --> 16:23.758
a real important phone call...

16:23.827 --> 16:24.976
- I just need you guys
for a few minutes!

16:25.000 --> 16:26.758
- Wha-uh... Dub?

16:26.827 --> 16:28.251
- They need me and Trip!
Call Bunny's cell!

16:28.275 --> 16:29.206
- Call Bunny!

16:29.275 --> 16:31.344
- I am! Uh...

16:31.413 --> 16:34.551
Bambi, Bianca, Bonnie, Britney,
Build-A-Bra... BUNNY!

16:38.482 --> 16:39.827
- Who is it?

16:39.896 --> 16:41.379
- It's Babe.

16:41.448 --> 16:42.965
Hey Babe!
- Okay, listen...

16:43.034 --> 16:44.724
- I know that Double G told you

16:44.793 --> 16:46.931
to drop a million dollars
in cash on this wedding.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.344
- Yeah...

16:48.413 --> 16:50.620
- We're only three miles
to the drop zone.

16:50.689 --> 16:52.413
- Okay, but we promised
Dub's brother

16:52.482 --> 16:55.000
that Dub wouldn't do anything
crazy at this wedding!

16:55.068 --> 16:57.000
So we don't need
thousands of $100 bills

16:57.068 --> 16:59.000
raining down on us!

16:59.068 --> 17:01.241
- Oh, we're not droppin'
$100 dollar bills.

17:01.310 --> 17:03.793
- But you said you were
about to drop a million dollars.

17:03.862 --> 17:04.931
- We are.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.241
- Silver dollars!

17:09.793 --> 17:12.862
- Si... silver dollars?!

17:12.931 --> 17:14.172
- What'd she say?!?

17:14.241 --> 17:16.172
- Babe, you're breakin' up.

17:16.241 --> 17:17.413
- Guys! You can't drop

17:17.482 --> 17:19.172
a million silver dollars
on a wedding!

17:19.241 --> 17:20.172
They could hurt people!

17:20.241 --> 17:22.172
- Hey, you better hang up.

17:22.241 --> 17:23.724
We're almost over the drop zone.

17:23.793 --> 17:25.172
- No, don't hang up!

17:25.241 --> 17:26.448
D'aaaah!!!

17:26.517 --> 17:28.620
- Excusee meee!

17:28.689 --> 17:31.344
Excuse me...

17:31.413 --> 17:32.586
Oh god!

17:34.172 --> 17:35.103
- Hi!

17:35.172 --> 17:36.965
Attention! Attention!?

17:37.034 --> 17:38.482
Your attention please?

17:38.551 --> 17:39.689
Here?

17:41.310 --> 17:44.379
Um... uh... according
to the weather service,

17:44.448 --> 17:46.724
it might start to rain
any minute now.

17:48.724 --> 17:49.965
- It's not gonna rain.

17:50.034 --> 17:51.758
- Well, it could rain!

17:51.827 --> 17:54.103
So, may I suggest
that we all run inside,

17:54.172 --> 17:56.310
y'know like, immediately?

17:56.379 --> 17:57.620
- Hey...

17:57.689 --> 17:59.241
here comes a plane.

18:02.551 --> 18:04.793
- Oh God.

18:04.862 --> 18:06.034
Um, people!

18:06.103 --> 18:07.448
- Hey, that plane's

18:07.517 --> 18:09.103
comin' in pretty low.

18:11.344 --> 18:12.793
- Double G?

18:12.862 --> 18:14.034
- Huh?

18:14.103 --> 18:16.310
- Is that your face
on that plane?

18:19.034 --> 18:21.137
- Uh, n-no, no, no,

18:21.206 --> 18:22.827
I don't, I don't know
who that could be.

18:25.000 --> 18:25.931
- Here we go!

18:26.000 --> 18:28.689
- One... two...

18:28.758 --> 18:30.413
Three!

18:35.827 --> 18:36.931
- Okay!

18:37.000 --> 18:38.655
Thirteen more cans to dump.

18:38.724 --> 18:40.344
- Let's get 'em.

18:43.241 --> 18:45.379
- Is... is that a cloud?

18:45.448 --> 18:47.103
- No, I don't think
that's a cloud.

18:47.172 --> 18:49.551
- That doesn't look
like $100 bills.

18:49.620 --> 18:50.827
- They're not!

18:50.896 --> 18:53.034
Those are silver dollars,
made of metal!!!

18:53.103 --> 18:54.172
- What?!?

18:54.241 --> 18:55.551

20:46.172 --> 20:47.344

20:47.413 --> 20:49.482
I knew if I invited you
to my wedding

20:49.551 --> 20:51.172
you would find some way
to ruin it!

20:52.517 --> 20:54.117
- I thought they was
gonna be $100 bills!

20:54.172 --> 20:55.758
- Be quiet, Gale!

20:55.827 --> 20:57.862
I want you out of
my life right now,

20:57.931 --> 21:00.068
'cuz you don't care about
anybody but yourself.

21:00.137 --> 21:01.758
- Man, don't-don't touch me.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
- Let me go baby.

Okay. Okay!

21:09.758 --> 21:11.655
Calm down!

21:13.344 --> 21:14.586
- Okay, yeah.

21:14.655 --> 21:16.896
Dub can be self-centered.

21:16.965 --> 21:18.310
- And obnoxious.

21:18.379 --> 21:20.793
- Hey now...

21:20.862 --> 21:25.137
- But he just risked
his life to save yours.

21:25.206 --> 21:26.344
- And y'know, Uncle Jordan,

21:26.413 --> 21:28.758
after you spend about nine days

21:28.827 --> 21:32.206
sweeping up all these coins,
you'll have a million dollars.

21:32.275 --> 21:33.655
- I don't care about no...

21:33.724 --> 21:35.517
How much?

21:35.586 --> 21:38.068
- A million dollars?!?

21:38.137 --> 21:39.689
- As a gift?

21:39.758 --> 21:41.172
For us?

21:41.241 --> 21:43.103
- Surprise.

21:43.172 --> 21:45.310
- Gale... that's...

21:45.379 --> 21:49.689
that's the most generous thing
I ever heard of.

21:49.758 --> 21:51.517
Why would you give me
a million dollars?

21:51.586 --> 21:55.827
- 'Cuz... I love you.

21:55.896 --> 21:57.413
And...

21:57.482 --> 21:58.793
'cuz you're poor.

22:02.620 --> 22:04.517
- I love you, Dub.
- Come on man...

22:12.103 --> 22:14.241
- Well c'mon,
is this a wedding or what?

22:14.310 --> 22:17.000

it's a wedding.
