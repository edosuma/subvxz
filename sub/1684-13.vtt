WEBVTT

00:49.008 --> 00:50.176
Blood?

01:27.505 --> 01:29.174
Why are you
eyeing me like that?

01:30.383 --> 01:32.093
Do I look ridiculous?
I look ridiculous.

01:33.678 --> 01:37.849
I have deciphered every code
from Caesar shift to Morse,

01:37.974 --> 01:41.394
yet the one that
will always elude me
is modern dress.

01:42.729 --> 01:46.274
How can one be both
business and casual?

01:46.357 --> 01:48.318
There. All good.

01:48.902 --> 01:51.696
Well, my wardrobe, perhaps.

01:51.988 --> 01:54.199
I'm afraid that
I cannot help you
with the rest of your date.

01:54.365 --> 01:56.451
Other than to tell you
that you don't have to go.

01:56.534 --> 01:59.329
No, Lieutenant,
Katrina and I owe it
to each other

01:59.412 --> 02:02.707
to have an evening free
from apocalyptic trial.

02:03.208 --> 02:05.960
A chance for us to see
who we are to one another

02:06.044 --> 02:08.421
in this new
modern context.

02:10.215 --> 02:12.091
If we are to be
anything at all.

02:12.175 --> 02:14.177
A night out isn't
gonna change the fact
that she's done things

02:14.260 --> 02:15.720
to compromise our team.

02:15.970 --> 02:17.514
I realize that.

02:18.223 --> 02:19.766
But tonight is
not about our team.

02:21.851 --> 02:24.062
An event at
the historical society.

02:24.312 --> 02:27.023
It's pretty much the opposite
of putting the past
behind you.

02:27.106 --> 02:31.903
Unlike me, Katrina has
had precious little time
to adjust to our world.

02:32.403 --> 02:35.240
Luckily, you fit right in
to modern times.

02:36.199 --> 02:38.910
A collection from
the Adams administration.

02:39.118 --> 02:40.912
How well did you know
our second president?

02:41.204 --> 02:43.081
Truth be told,
John and Abigail Adams

02:43.248 --> 02:45.124
were more Katrina's
friends than mine.

02:45.333 --> 02:46.751
She was
Mrs. Adams' midwife.

02:46.835 --> 02:48.670
Delivered all five
of their children.

02:48.920 --> 02:50.088
One of them became
president, too.

02:50.213 --> 02:51.381
Quite a claim to fame.

02:52.298 --> 02:54.551
If she could
actually claim it.

02:54.634 --> 02:58.638
Which reminds me,
no name-dropping
Founding Fathers tonight.

02:58.721 --> 03:00.473
No firsthand accounts
of your apprenticeship

03:00.557 --> 03:03.393
with Ben Franklin
or your fling
with Betsy Ross.

03:05.937 --> 03:08.314
You had a dalliance
with Betsy Ross?

03:08.815 --> 03:10.149
Betsy who?

03:10.400 --> 03:11.401
Good answer.

03:15.154 --> 03:16.406
Have a good night, you two.

03:26.082 --> 03:27.584
About Betsy...

03:31.588 --> 03:35.174
In this self-portrait
of Colonial-era
artist James Colby,

03:35.258 --> 03:38.803
you'll note the artist
left his canvas unfinished.

03:39.012 --> 03:40.680
The inverted
cross lacks detail,

03:41.389 --> 03:43.850
suggesting Colby's desire
to leave the viewer,

03:43.933 --> 03:46.144
and perhaps himself,
in suspense.

03:46.227 --> 03:47.854
In modern America,

03:47.937 --> 03:49.814
touching in public
is quite permitted.

03:51.983 --> 03:54.569
It also warrants
the expression,
"Get a room."

03:54.652 --> 03:57.822
The Society was pleased
to add the Colby painting,

03:58.156 --> 04:00.867
which once hung in the home
of President John Adams.

04:00.950 --> 04:02.744
I do not have
any recollection
of that painting

04:02.827 --> 04:04.162
in the Adams residence.

04:04.245 --> 04:06.664
Our next stop
is the very desk

04:06.748 --> 04:10.585
on which Abigail Adams
wrote countless letters
to her husband.

04:11.044 --> 04:12.462
Now that, I remember.

04:16.132 --> 04:17.550
Ah...
Oh. Uh...

04:18.343 --> 04:20.929
Katrina, please,
let me introduce
my very dear friend.

04:21.012 --> 04:22.221
Mr. Hollister.

04:22.597 --> 04:25.808
You must be the Society's
art restorer Ichabod
speaks so kindly of.

04:25.892 --> 04:27.685
Oh, I can tell by
the paint on your hands.

04:27.769 --> 04:29.771
Oh, yeah,
it won't seem to come off.

04:30.688 --> 04:32.523
Um, Ichabod,
you got a minute?

04:32.732 --> 04:33.733
Oh, um...

04:36.694 --> 04:37.695
Um...

04:40.531 --> 04:43.451
Uh, we've talked
about Sleepy Hollow's
unusual history.

04:44.786 --> 04:47.038
Well, you know,
some of the ghost stories.

04:48.206 --> 04:49.540
Of course.

04:49.791 --> 04:53.795
Gosh, I don't know,
maybe it's just the paint
thinner talking, but, um...

04:53.878 --> 04:55.088
Do you believe in 'em?

04:55.713 --> 04:56.714
Spirits?

04:57.840 --> 04:59.592
Mr. Crane, excuse me.

04:59.676 --> 05:01.344
A word?

05:04.263 --> 05:05.723
All these cracks
in the frame.

05:05.848 --> 05:07.225
I'm sorry...

05:07.308 --> 05:09.936
Do you know
how embarrassing this
could be for the Society?

05:10.019 --> 05:11.312
I tried, sir.

05:11.396 --> 05:13.022
This way, please.

05:17.860 --> 05:19.237
Katrina.

05:19.612 --> 05:21.572
My dearest friend.

05:21.656 --> 05:23.908
How I wish I were still there.

05:37.630 --> 05:40.091
Katrina?
What is it?

05:40.591 --> 05:42.969
I... I felt
a dark presence.

05:45.555 --> 05:47.223
Something is amiss.

05:48.474 --> 05:52.270
Grant has also felt
some sort of haunting.

05:55.940 --> 05:58.693
Please make your way
to the dining room.

05:59.902 --> 06:01.112
Let's keep
our eyes open.

06:19.505 --> 06:20.506
You want coffee?

06:22.467 --> 06:23.718
No, I'm good, thank you.

06:23.885 --> 06:24.927
What's that?

06:25.970 --> 06:28.139
This is a...

06:28.431 --> 06:29.640
Believe it or not,
it's a journal

06:29.724 --> 06:31.309
that's been in my family
a couple hundred years.

06:31.476 --> 06:33.019
And I recently found it.

06:33.102 --> 06:34.979
Cool. Take care of it.

06:35.146 --> 06:36.731
Nowhere safer
than the precinct.

06:45.156 --> 06:46.324
On your knees!

06:46.491 --> 06:47.658
Oh, hey! Hey!

06:47.909 --> 06:49.077
Don't move!

06:49.202 --> 06:50.411
Let me see your hands!

06:51.829 --> 06:52.997
Now!

07:18.022 --> 07:21.776
The porcelain is
from Thomas Jefferson's
Monticello estate...

07:22.276 --> 07:24.195
The flowers etched
into this crystal

07:24.362 --> 07:26.280
are a favorite
of the First Lady.

07:26.364 --> 07:28.741
They belonged
to Abigail Adams.

07:29.450 --> 07:32.620
To you, Katrina,
the soon-to-be mother.

07:32.829 --> 07:34.705
I'm so thrilled
for you to experience

07:34.831 --> 07:36.707
the joys of motherhood,
as I have.

07:36.791 --> 07:39.293
Ichabod is going to be
the happiest man alive.

07:39.377 --> 07:42.255
That is, until he meets
the little monster.

07:44.215 --> 07:46.092
Seeing her things here

07:47.218 --> 07:50.304
makes me realize I left
that world so abruptly.

07:50.471 --> 07:53.850
I never got the chance
to say good-bye to her.

07:53.933 --> 07:55.268
To anyone.

08:09.740 --> 08:10.950
No.

08:11.159 --> 08:12.785
No, it can't be...

08:28.259 --> 08:32.513
I experienced this
sense of loss, myself.

08:34.098 --> 08:37.268
But, though our
friends are gone,

08:38.936 --> 08:40.813
you and I remain.

08:40.897 --> 08:44.734
And we must try
to make our way
in the present.

08:45.568 --> 08:46.611
Without them.

08:46.736 --> 08:47.778
Perhaps not.

08:49.322 --> 08:52.867
This place is bringing my
old friend Abigail back to me.

08:53.576 --> 08:56.412
I get the distinct feeling
these memories have purpose.

09:49.298 --> 09:50.883
<i>How is he alive?</i>

09:51.759 --> 09:53.719
<i>We saw him die</i>
<i>on the battlefield.</i>

09:53.928 --> 09:56.555
We saw him die.
Nobody here did.

09:57.431 --> 09:58.724
They think he's a cop killer

09:58.808 --> 10:00.518
that's been in hiding
the past six weeks.

10:01.477 --> 10:02.645
Henry.

10:03.187 --> 10:05.356
Henry claimed his soul
before his death.

10:05.606 --> 10:07.733
<i>Perhaps he has</i>
<i>been resurrected</i>

10:07.817 --> 10:11.988
<i>in a similar fashion to your</i>
<i>old friend Andy Brooks.</i>

10:12.655 --> 10:14.198
Which means he could
be working his way back

10:14.282 --> 10:16.534
into the fold
to take us down.

10:17.994 --> 10:20.329
I'm gonna try and find out,
but Reyes made him off-limits.

10:20.413 --> 10:22.290
She's gonna deal
with it herself

10:22.373 --> 10:24.333
after she handles the, um...

10:24.417 --> 10:26.252
Our deceased restorer.

10:26.335 --> 10:29.213
<i>I'm sorry.</i>
<i>I know you'd become friends.</i>

10:30.464 --> 10:31.882
They said that
he was suspended.

10:31.966 --> 10:33.384
Do you think it
was ritualistic?

10:34.010 --> 10:35.845
Grant confided

10:36.304 --> 10:38.472
he felt a presence
haunting him.

10:38.556 --> 10:40.182
<i>There must be some connection.</i>

10:40.433 --> 10:41.726
For this to happen
the same time

10:41.809 --> 10:43.728
that Frank Irving
returns from the grave?

10:43.894 --> 10:45.563
Perhaps Grant's killer
was another entity

10:45.730 --> 10:47.398
released during
Moloch's death.

10:47.481 --> 10:51.319
Listen, Crane,
Reyes is about to roll in
and take over the crime scene.

10:51.402 --> 10:53.154
<i>So you need to</i>
<i>start investigating</i>

10:53.237 --> 10:55.489
<i>whatever this is in</i>
<i>the next few minutes.</i>

10:57.408 --> 10:58.451
Or less.

10:58.701 --> 11:01.912
I'm sorry
your date night
didn't go well.

11:02.079 --> 11:03.372
Well, no.

11:03.831 --> 11:06.125
Katrina also felt
a dark presence.

11:08.127 --> 11:10.713
And these
once familiar surroundings,

11:10.796 --> 11:14.383
have spurred memories
of those who have long passed.

11:15.092 --> 11:17.428
You can take the girl
out of the 18th century...

11:17.636 --> 11:19.347
But it is a more
formidable endeavor

11:19.430 --> 11:21.599
to remove the 18th century
from the girl.

11:22.099 --> 11:24.101
Something like that, yeah.

11:24.435 --> 11:26.604
<i>Godspeed to us both,</i>
<i>Lieutenant.</i>

11:51.003 --> 11:53.047
The way the body
was positioned after death

11:53.130 --> 11:54.507
suggests some kind of ritual,

11:54.590 --> 11:57.885
a specific internal logic
or meaning for the killer.

12:00.805 --> 12:02.473
Sheriff Leena Reyes.
And you are?

12:02.932 --> 12:04.183
Katrina Crane.

12:04.266 --> 12:06.018
Ichabod has a wife?

12:06.268 --> 12:07.812
Oh, he never
mentioned you.

12:08.562 --> 12:11.148
We've only recently reunited

12:11.232 --> 12:13.234
following an extended
separation.

12:13.442 --> 12:16.862
Well, your husband
has proven himself
to be an odd,

12:16.946 --> 12:18.989
but valuable asset
to my department.

12:19.365 --> 12:22.368
Especially at a crime scene
in a historical society.

12:22.451 --> 12:23.577
You two don't
mind sticking around

12:23.661 --> 12:25.121
till we wrap
things up here, do you?

12:31.544 --> 12:33.379
Are you all right?

12:33.462 --> 12:35.423
What did the sheriff say?

12:35.506 --> 12:37.633
I am afraid
the authorities
will never

12:37.758 --> 12:39.844
understand the truth
behind this tragedy.

12:40.511 --> 12:41.637
Quite right.

12:42.346 --> 12:44.014
This was no
random killing.

12:44.348 --> 12:47.685
This was a specific ritual
meant to invoke
the Hanged Man.

12:51.397 --> 12:54.150
The 12th card
of major arcana
from the tarot.

12:54.316 --> 12:56.735
Since when have you
been reading the tarot?

12:56.944 --> 13:00.197
Since someone left a deck
in our parlor one summer.

13:01.240 --> 13:02.533
I assumed it was
for recreation.

13:02.700 --> 13:03.993
Well,
now you know better.

13:06.203 --> 13:09.457
Turning over the Hanged Man
reflects struggle

13:09.540 --> 13:11.542
from death to rebirth.

13:16.255 --> 13:17.298
Of course.

13:17.381 --> 13:21.844
This death is identical
to a series of murders
from 1781.

13:23.220 --> 13:26.599
The manner in which way
his throat is sliced
and the body inverted...

13:27.057 --> 13:28.809
The Durham killings.

13:29.685 --> 13:32.563
John Adams was
the lawyer seeking justice
for the victims.

13:32.646 --> 13:33.731
He was.

13:34.523 --> 13:37.067
But it was not John
I learned the specifics
of the case from.

13:38.486 --> 13:40.154
It was Abigail Adams.

13:41.864 --> 13:44.742
Your friend,
Mrs. Adams, was a...

13:46.035 --> 13:47.536
A witch?
Yes.

13:47.912 --> 13:49.955
No. Just highly opinionated.

13:50.706 --> 13:53.334
Right.
A champion for
those unrepresented.

13:53.834 --> 13:55.377
This is his latest victim.

13:55.461 --> 13:57.087
The portrait is
all that's left
of the poor thing.

13:57.588 --> 14:00.925
<i>You see,</i>
<i>the victims of these slayings</i>
<i>were orphans, vagrants.</i>

14:01.091 --> 14:03.969
Abigail could not bear
to have their deaths
go unremarked.

14:04.053 --> 14:05.721
All found hanged
in the same way,

14:05.846 --> 14:07.515
their throats slit
in the same location.

14:07.598 --> 14:10.309
A particular
area on the neck
had been targeted,

14:10.434 --> 14:11.560
the carotid artery.

14:11.644 --> 14:14.772
If punctured,
it could result in
tremendous blood loss,

14:14.855 --> 14:16.857
particularly if the body
was hanged upside down.

14:16.941 --> 14:18.692
That, along with
the precision of the cuts,

14:18.776 --> 14:20.861
led Abigail to conclude
that the killer...

14:20.945 --> 14:23.364
...must have
a medical background.

14:23.447 --> 14:24.532
Perhaps a surgeon.

14:24.865 --> 14:27.576
She never did find
the culprit, though.

14:28.702 --> 14:30.454
And the murders
went unsolved.

14:32.456 --> 14:35.459
I think, we may now
be facing the same threat.

14:36.961 --> 14:39.880
A threat I was powerless
to stop back then.

14:40.965 --> 14:43.801
Perhaps, you should call
upon your own Abigail
for assistance.

14:44.385 --> 14:45.886
These memories
of Abigail Adams

14:46.011 --> 14:47.513
are not meant
to hold you back,

14:47.596 --> 14:49.139
but to guide you forwards.

14:50.140 --> 14:53.852
Mrs. Adams would want
you and I to find
this elusive killer.

14:55.771 --> 14:56.772
So let us try.

15:07.950 --> 15:09.159
I'll take over.

15:09.243 --> 15:11.078
Are you sure?
Sheriff Reyes...

15:11.161 --> 15:13.831
Gave me the authority
to speak to him.

15:30.848 --> 15:32.182
What the hell
happened to me?

15:32.641 --> 15:33.809
How much
do you remember?

15:35.561 --> 15:41.108
You and Jenny, Crane, Katrina
came to me with a sword?

15:45.029 --> 15:46.488
After that,
it all goes blank.

15:47.615 --> 15:49.074
Based on the way
you've been looking at me,

15:49.158 --> 15:50.242
I'm guessing I lost.

15:51.368 --> 15:52.369
No, we won.

15:56.373 --> 15:57.791
But there was a cost.

15:59.001 --> 16:00.002
You died.

16:00.961 --> 16:03.297
Six weeks ago,
we buried you ourselves.

16:04.381 --> 16:05.716
So...

16:05.799 --> 16:09.094
What are you saying,
I'm a walking corpse
right now?

16:10.387 --> 16:12.139
Nobody else knows that?

16:12.222 --> 16:13.641
We told your family.

16:14.099 --> 16:16.560
Cynthia and Macey
have been grieving you.

16:16.685 --> 16:18.187
Well, how am I here?

16:19.730 --> 16:21.315
How am I breathing?

16:21.398 --> 16:24.485
Your soul belongs to
the Horseman of War, so...

16:24.902 --> 16:25.986
As far as I can tell,

16:26.070 --> 16:27.863
your being here
is a sign of his return.

16:27.946 --> 16:29.865
You think I'm dangerous?

16:33.160 --> 16:35.913
I don't know
what happened to me.

16:36.413 --> 16:39.583
I walked in the door,
looking for a safe place.

16:41.293 --> 16:43.087
Looking for you.

16:47.257 --> 16:48.550
You couldn't
possibly understand

16:48.634 --> 16:50.386
how much I want you
to be here.

16:54.723 --> 16:58.060
The old you,
the friend that
I've been grieving.

16:59.103 --> 17:01.105
But it's hard to know.

17:01.647 --> 17:03.857
You remember Brooks?

17:03.941 --> 17:04.983
How he betrayed us.

17:05.067 --> 17:07.111
I cannot risk that
happening again.

17:08.112 --> 17:09.530
So what are you gonna do?

17:10.489 --> 17:12.116
I am gonna
tell your wife,

17:12.199 --> 17:13.951
so that she doesn't
find out some other way.

17:14.118 --> 17:15.119
Bring her here.

17:16.662 --> 17:19.873
Cynthia will know
that it is really me.

17:22.084 --> 17:23.794
Abbie.

17:25.003 --> 17:27.256
You cannot
leave me like this.

17:27.673 --> 17:29.425
Please!
I'm sorry.

17:29.883 --> 17:31.593
Abbie!

17:36.348 --> 17:39.476
The smallest details
fill in the largest canvas.

17:43.647 --> 17:45.232
Prior to his death,

17:45.315 --> 17:48.736
Grant was rebuked
over the condition
of this painting.

17:52.781 --> 17:54.575
The artist's tools.

17:54.658 --> 17:55.951
The blade.

17:56.034 --> 17:58.120
That red paint was
not there before.

18:05.544 --> 18:06.837
Blood.

18:07.796 --> 18:09.298
It's wet.

18:09.465 --> 18:10.716
Fresh.

18:10.799 --> 18:13.927
The art docent identified this
as a self-portrait

18:14.011 --> 18:15.554
of the artist
who painted it.

18:16.013 --> 18:18.682
Not only would a surgeon
have an understanding
of human anatomy...

18:18.766 --> 18:20.350
So, too, would an artist.

18:22.728 --> 18:25.147
The assassin we seek,

18:25.230 --> 18:27.608
he's been hiding
here all along,

18:28.442 --> 18:32.154
finding safe harbor
in the one place no one
would imagine to look.

18:51.215 --> 18:52.466
It seems our
long-dead artist

18:52.549 --> 18:54.593
has found a way to escape
that painted world.

18:54.676 --> 18:57.262
And murder
an innocent man in ours.

19:00.098 --> 19:02.142
How is it even possible?

19:02.226 --> 19:06.146
Moloch used mirrors
as portals between this
world and Purgatory.

19:06.230 --> 19:08.482
That painting could also
act as such a doorway.

19:10.234 --> 19:13.028
Grant also
had paint on his hands.

19:14.154 --> 19:16.907
Perhaps he disturbed
the picture
whilst restoring it.

19:17.032 --> 19:20.410
Somehow activating
the cursed energy
lying dormant within it.

19:22.412 --> 19:24.331
If we are indeed
contending with the same

19:24.414 --> 19:26.500
serial killer
in the modern day,

19:26.583 --> 19:30.712
we must endeavor to
learn of this artist,
James Colby.

19:31.880 --> 19:33.549
Did you know of him?

19:33.674 --> 19:35.926
He was once hailed
as a visionary,

19:36.009 --> 19:39.304
a man who would
document the birth
of America on canvas.

19:39.388 --> 19:41.890
I take it he gained
no notoriety.

19:42.099 --> 19:44.685
His talents were wasted
on drinks and lechery.

19:44.768 --> 19:47.396
His palette tempted
more by port than paint.

19:47.521 --> 19:50.107
He was ultimately cast out
by Washington's circle.

19:51.441 --> 19:54.778
Here. When Colby
was exiled, he became
a limner artist,

19:54.945 --> 19:56.113
traveling the Hudson Valley,

19:56.196 --> 19:59.408
offering portraits
in exchange
for room and board.

20:00.617 --> 20:04.621
He disappeared
without a trace in 1782.

20:04.705 --> 20:06.832
It follows the same pattern.

20:07.457 --> 20:09.877
The murders Abigail Adams
sought to solve...

20:09.960 --> 20:12.129
Were committed by this man.

20:13.297 --> 20:15.007
Through some form
of enchantment,

20:15.090 --> 20:17.175
his spirit is using
that painting as refuge.

20:18.343 --> 20:20.846
That must be why he drains
his victims of blood.

20:22.890 --> 20:24.933
<i>The blood on his tool</i>
<i>from killing Grant,</i>

20:25.017 --> 20:27.811
he's using it to paint
the inverted cross,

20:28.228 --> 20:31.231
to finish the image
of the Hanged Man.

20:31.315 --> 20:33.358
And like
the Hanged Man itself,

20:33.442 --> 20:34.902
Colby plans his resurrection

20:34.985 --> 20:36.904
by finishing
the unfinished work.

20:38.113 --> 20:40.240
If he requires more
blood to paint with,

20:40.324 --> 20:42.492
he will take
another victim.

20:50.709 --> 20:51.710
He's gone.

20:52.669 --> 20:55.047
He's getting closer
to completing the cross.

20:55.672 --> 20:56.673
Miller.

20:57.132 --> 20:58.759
<i>All these cracks</i>
<i>in the frame...</i>

20:59.176 --> 21:02.262
<i>When I saw</i>
<i>him arguing with Grant,</i>
<i>he touched the painting.</i>

21:02.512 --> 21:06.516
<i>And when we first saw Grant,</i>
<i>he had red paint on his hands.</i>

21:07.351 --> 21:10.187
That must be how
Colby accesses victims.

21:10.270 --> 21:13.065
Ichabod. You touched
the painting as well.

21:13.523 --> 21:16.443
All the more reason for me
to find Miller before Colby.

21:16.693 --> 21:18.779
We mustn't let anyone else
near this painting.

21:18.862 --> 21:20.572
It's right in here.

21:31.667 --> 21:32.668
Uh...

21:32.960 --> 21:37.130
You remain with the painting,
and ensure no one
else comes near it.

21:38.715 --> 21:40.759
With a different distraction.

21:44.513 --> 21:47.057
Mr. Miller,
a word, if you please.

21:48.225 --> 21:50.060
Frank Irving is alive?

21:50.560 --> 21:54.106
I don't know if "alive"
is the right term,
but he's back.

21:55.315 --> 21:57.067
This is incredible.

21:58.944 --> 22:00.237
Isn't it?

22:03.031 --> 22:04.658
Does he remember anything?

22:04.741 --> 22:06.284
The fight.
But not his death.

22:07.744 --> 22:10.622
You think he's covering,
because Henry owns his soul.

22:11.039 --> 22:13.291
This isn't our first round
with a resurrected friend.

22:13.375 --> 22:15.293
Irving's not
the same as Brooks.

22:15.377 --> 22:17.671
Brooks made
a deal with Moloch.

22:18.046 --> 22:19.756
Irving was our friend.

22:20.424 --> 22:22.426
He went to prison
protecting his family.

22:23.552 --> 22:24.928
He died fighting for us.

22:25.012 --> 22:27.139
I will never forget that.

22:29.182 --> 22:30.934
But the key word
here is "died."

22:32.019 --> 22:34.229
He died. We all saw it.

22:34.855 --> 22:37.274
What else could that mean
except that he's
here on Henry's behalf?

22:37.357 --> 22:39.359
Yeah, but Henry's gone.

22:39.443 --> 22:40.485
Might even be dead.

22:40.569 --> 22:42.821
Irving's soul
could be released.

22:42.904 --> 22:45.198
Until we know for sure,

22:45.282 --> 22:46.992
we've gotta prepare
for the worst.

22:48.326 --> 22:52.039
Meaning you want a weapon.
To use against Irving.

22:52.122 --> 22:54.374
If we have to put a dead man
back in the grave,

22:54.458 --> 22:56.126
that's what we do.

22:56.585 --> 22:58.045
Even if that man is Irving.

23:01.548 --> 23:04.176
I need to stay here,
'cause Cynthia's
on her way over.

23:04.259 --> 23:06.303
And in case anything
else undead happens.

23:06.428 --> 23:07.929
Hawley must know
of something we can use.

23:08.013 --> 23:10.432
He's out of town.
I'll try to get
ahold of him.

23:10.515 --> 23:13.185
I'm sure there's some
zombie-killing crossbow

23:13.268 --> 23:15.645
or local corpse cannon
he's got a bead on.

23:15.896 --> 23:17.898
I need to know that I can
count on you for this.

23:17.981 --> 23:19.274
I'm game.

23:20.484 --> 23:22.527
But whatever I bring back,

23:22.986 --> 23:24.905
I really hope we
won't need to use it.

23:26.156 --> 23:27.407
Me, too.

23:33.830 --> 23:37.417
Sorry I couldn't
give you any details
over the phone.

23:37.501 --> 23:38.752
Since Frank's death,

23:39.252 --> 23:41.338
I've had to get used
to your cryptic messages.

23:41.421 --> 23:44.049
I don't love it,
but I understand.

23:44.549 --> 23:48.095
You deal with forces
I didn't even know existed
until recently, so...

23:48.178 --> 23:51.264
I told you six weeks ago
that his death saved lives,

23:51.348 --> 23:53.058
possibly thousands of them.

23:53.683 --> 23:55.685
Abbie, why am I here?

23:56.311 --> 23:58.939
Like you and
like your daughter,
I've mourned him.

24:02.359 --> 24:03.860
And earlier tonight...

24:10.158 --> 24:13.203
This is a live feed
from the precinct's
interrogation room.

24:15.038 --> 24:16.206
My God!

24:16.581 --> 24:17.999
He walked in here,
turned himself in.

24:18.083 --> 24:20.585
Seemingly no memory
of how he got here

24:20.669 --> 24:22.879
or what happened
to him after.

24:25.632 --> 24:28.844
You needed to
hear this from me
before word got out.

24:28.927 --> 24:31.388
To everyone else,
the manhunt is over.

24:31.471 --> 24:33.723
To us, he's back
from the dead.

24:33.807 --> 24:35.892
No one can ever know that.

24:36.309 --> 24:39.312
But, um, how is he...

24:42.065 --> 24:43.150
Okay.

24:43.525 --> 24:45.694
Abbie, I need to see him.

24:45.902 --> 24:47.571
Okay.
He wants to see you, too.

24:50.615 --> 24:53.285
I'm sorry,
we can't take that risk.
Not until we know...

24:53.368 --> 24:55.412
Know what?
If he's dangerous.

24:56.204 --> 24:57.539
You remember
the blood contract

24:57.622 --> 24:59.791
he made with Henry Parrish?

24:59.875 --> 25:01.835
We need to know for sure

25:02.085 --> 25:04.171
if your husband's
here to pose a threat.

25:05.922 --> 25:07.299
How do we do that?

25:11.678 --> 25:14.931
Grant said that he wanted
to remount the painting,

25:15.390 --> 25:18.268
but he couldn't get the canvas
separated from the backing.

25:18.351 --> 25:19.811
What else did Grant say?

25:19.895 --> 25:23.315
He said the painting
spoke to him.

25:24.274 --> 25:27.861
That he heard a voice
and it wanted blood.

25:28.612 --> 25:31.114
And you believed him

25:32.365 --> 25:33.742
because you heard it, too?

25:34.993 --> 25:36.244
Hmm.

25:50.592 --> 25:53.178
We found him, Abigail.
Finally.

25:55.430 --> 25:57.641
If only I could let you know.

26:30.507 --> 26:31.675
Colby.

26:54.823 --> 26:57.575
I can't believe Hawley
is not here to help me

26:57.659 --> 27:00.412
retrieve these
creature-killing bullets.

27:00.870 --> 27:02.330
How did Hawley authenticate
that the bullets

27:02.414 --> 27:04.916
are made from platinum
from the actual
Gates of Hell?

27:05.000 --> 27:06.001
<i>I have no idea.</i>

27:06.710 --> 27:10.422
But he said his previous buyer
was satisfied, so here I am.

27:10.547 --> 27:11.548
Ugh!

27:11.965 --> 27:14.301
I guess even treasure hunters
have Yelp reviews.

27:24.894 --> 27:27.897
Oh, you've got
to be kidding me.

27:28.481 --> 27:29.566
What?

27:29.649 --> 27:33.361
Hawley said the bullets
were buried with the guy,
not in him.

27:46.082 --> 27:47.083
Ugh.

27:59.179 --> 28:01.181
Do you remember
that Thanksgiving

28:01.264 --> 28:03.933
Mama had you reach
inside the turkey
and grab the giblets?

28:04.017 --> 28:05.101
Mmm-hmm.

28:07.103 --> 28:08.104
It's my turn.

28:16.112 --> 28:17.280
Oh, God!

28:17.489 --> 28:18.698
You need me to
come over there?

28:18.782 --> 28:20.283
<i>No, no, it's okay.</i>

28:20.367 --> 28:22.869
I just got one more.
I'll be back soon.

28:23.912 --> 28:25.121
Okay.

28:46.893 --> 28:50.438
Thanks for
telling me to leave one
in the body, Hawley!

28:50.897 --> 28:52.565
You need to leave.

28:52.816 --> 28:54.275
Immediately.

28:54.359 --> 28:55.735
But the police are here.

28:55.860 --> 28:57.237
The police
cannot protect you.

28:58.738 --> 28:59.823
What are you saying?

29:00.657 --> 29:03.701
You think whatever
killed Grant is coming
after me now?

29:03.827 --> 29:05.954
Miller, stop talking.
Help me.

29:06.037 --> 29:08.581
They'll think I'm running
because I'm guilty.

29:36.901 --> 29:37.944
Miller.

29:38.445 --> 29:40.572
Killing Miller could
be all Colby requires

29:40.697 --> 29:42.824
to finish the resurrection
ritual he started.

29:43.533 --> 29:44.617
Wait, wait.

29:46.202 --> 29:47.370
The fractures
in the frame.

29:48.872 --> 29:50.165
There's a pattern to them.

29:51.583 --> 29:54.085
As if they were
made intentionally.

29:58.131 --> 29:59.799
These are not
mere cracks.

30:00.175 --> 30:01.718
They are runes.

30:02.844 --> 30:04.429
To what purpose?

30:04.762 --> 30:06.556
They are part of
an entrapment hex.

30:08.183 --> 30:10.685
Placed on this painting
to keep the killer
locked inside it.

30:12.187 --> 30:13.688
Then this
was imprisonment.

30:14.689 --> 30:16.232
Placed here by whom?

30:17.275 --> 30:18.776
Reverend Knapp.

30:18.860 --> 30:20.403
My own coven.

30:21.154 --> 30:24.782
Upon request by Abigail Adams,
after I was gone.

30:24.866 --> 30:27.368
It's all in here
in her secret records.

30:27.952 --> 30:31.956
She discovered that
Colby was the killer
and set out to stop him.

30:32.832 --> 30:35.543
<i>Abigail allowed</i>
<i>herself to be captured.</i>

30:36.127 --> 30:39.255
You'll be my finest work,
Mrs. Adams.

30:39.756 --> 30:41.257
<i>But Colby was unaware</i>

30:41.341 --> 30:44.093
<i>that Abigail had enlisted</i>
<i>the aid of Reverend Knapp.</i>

30:53.269 --> 30:56.856
Your murderous rampage
is over, Mr. Colby.

31:06.282 --> 31:08.910
<i>Colby's imprisoned</i>
<i>within the canvas.</i>

31:09.452 --> 31:11.913
Abigail kept this painting
to keep watch over him.

31:12.205 --> 31:15.041
And Grant had the misfortune
to release him.

31:15.124 --> 31:16.417
Mr. and Mrs. Crane.

31:17.168 --> 31:19.629
We're looking for
the event curator, Miller.

31:20.171 --> 31:22.048
No, I've not seen him.

31:23.883 --> 31:25.301
What are you two
doing in here, anyway?

31:26.302 --> 31:27.303
Saying good-bye.

31:27.679 --> 31:31.432
Ichabod wanted to
appreciate Grant's work
for one last time.

31:32.850 --> 31:34.352
Don't be long.

31:36.688 --> 31:38.439
Thank you, Sheriff.

31:40.275 --> 31:42.569
If Colby dragged
Miller into his world,

31:42.652 --> 31:46.489
is it possible for me
to enter voluntarily
and stop him?

31:46.573 --> 31:47.657
It might be possible,

31:49.534 --> 31:50.827
but we need privacy.

31:51.369 --> 31:52.954
We must take the painting
somewhere else.

31:53.454 --> 31:55.456
I know where to take it.

32:00.211 --> 32:02.630
This is where Grant
did his work.

32:07.427 --> 32:08.428
Are you ready?

32:15.852 --> 32:17.520
What are you doing?

32:17.770 --> 32:19.147
No more separating.

32:19.230 --> 32:21.232
We do this together.

32:21.691 --> 32:24.068
This monster was
once captured
by my dearest friend.

32:24.193 --> 32:26.529
I plan to make sure
he remains imprisoned.

32:28.740 --> 32:29.782
For Abigail.

32:33.870 --> 32:34.871
For Abigail.

32:41.586 --> 32:44.714
From this plane to another,
we seek a doorway.

33:08.946 --> 33:10.281
Now, we're inside.

33:15.787 --> 33:18.331
And have entered
the mind of a murderer.

33:28.883 --> 33:29.884
Frank...

33:31.135 --> 33:32.303
Jenny?

33:34.180 --> 33:36.391
You're a sight
for sore eyes.

33:37.225 --> 33:38.935
Hang in there, friend.

33:52.115 --> 33:54.367
They're transferring him
to a holding cell.

33:54.575 --> 33:56.119
At least you got to
talk to him first.

34:03.626 --> 34:04.669
Thank you.

34:05.086 --> 34:07.880
So promise me these bullets
are a last resort.

34:10.258 --> 34:15.054
I saw a monster tonight,
and Frank Irving,
he's not one.

34:15.430 --> 34:16.806
I know
it seems that way.

34:17.014 --> 34:19.142
The department doctor
gave him a medical exam,

34:19.225 --> 34:20.935
standard procedure
for criminal intake

34:21.018 --> 34:23.563
and everything about him
appears normal.

34:25.481 --> 34:28.568
It's not his
heart and lungs
I'm worried about.

34:28.651 --> 34:30.987
It's his soul.
It's what we can't see.

34:33.698 --> 34:35.158
He doesn't need
a medical exam.

34:35.241 --> 34:36.826
He needs a supernatural one.

34:38.745 --> 34:39.954
Maybe Katrina could do it.

34:43.499 --> 34:46.669
I know. I'm not her
biggest fan, either.

34:47.462 --> 34:48.463
But she may be our best hope

34:48.546 --> 34:49.839
at knowing if
we can trust him.

34:51.340 --> 34:53.092
We owe it to Irving to try.

34:56.888 --> 34:58.639
I thought maybe Katrina could

34:58.723 --> 35:01.893
do some kind of supernatural
physical on Irving.

35:01.976 --> 35:04.020
Assess if his soul
has been darkened.

35:04.187 --> 35:06.063
The fact that
you're not picking up

35:06.147 --> 35:08.191
has me a little more worried.

35:09.025 --> 35:11.194
Whatever the hell's
going on over there,

35:11.986 --> 35:13.321
I got your back.

35:16.407 --> 35:18.075
We must find Miller,

35:18.201 --> 35:19.869
before Colby
completes the ritual.

35:21.746 --> 35:23.873
Any idea what this place is?

35:24.957 --> 35:27.710
This house belonged
to the Colby family.

35:28.377 --> 35:30.421
It seems to be abandoned.

35:30.880 --> 35:32.924
Colby is here somewhere

35:36.385 --> 35:39.222
controlling this
sick manifestation.

35:41.849 --> 35:43.226
Be vigilant.

36:04.747 --> 36:07.834
There's so much sadness
and pain in this house.

36:10.044 --> 36:13.130
Colby must have been
dissuaded from his talents.

36:13.923 --> 36:17.760
Only to later turn death
into his own form of art.

36:19.679 --> 36:20.972
Miller.

36:29.605 --> 36:30.773
Miller.

36:32.692 --> 36:33.776
Is he still alive?

36:33.943 --> 36:35.027
Just.

36:40.950 --> 36:42.118
Oh, he's done it.

36:42.326 --> 36:44.579
Colby has freed himself
to escape this realm forever.

36:44.662 --> 36:46.956
We have little time.
Lower him.

36:59.010 --> 37:00.428
Quickly. He's lost
quite a bit of blood.

37:00.553 --> 37:01.971
Take us back.

37:12.815 --> 37:14.108
Katrina...

37:14.233 --> 37:15.484
Colby.

37:22.283 --> 37:24.368
Too late.

37:25.119 --> 37:26.203
Finish it!

37:26.746 --> 37:28.372
Katrina, get us out of here!

37:30.166 --> 37:31.375
Katrina?

37:32.710 --> 37:36.631
Katrina, quickly!
Finish it!

37:43.012 --> 37:44.639
The painting.
Must be destroyed.

37:45.389 --> 37:46.682
Quickly!

37:57.526 --> 37:58.611
Ichabod!

38:14.585 --> 38:15.628
The painting!

38:15.711 --> 38:17.755
Lieutenant,
fire at the painting!

38:35.314 --> 38:36.649
You didn't answer your phone.

38:43.197 --> 38:45.992
Sheriff, any details
on Miller's condition?

38:46.075 --> 38:48.619
EMD says Miller's
gonna make it.

38:48.703 --> 38:51.455
You know, the knife
used to slit his throat
and Hollister's

38:51.539 --> 38:53.124
was found
on the suspect,

38:53.207 --> 38:54.875
but no further ID.

38:55.376 --> 38:57.169
Perhaps a vagrant?

38:57.253 --> 38:59.964
As unknown to this world,
as to his own.

39:01.757 --> 39:04.301
Ma'am, is there anything
that you need me to do?

39:04.468 --> 39:06.262
How about
follow instructions?

39:06.429 --> 39:08.514
I gave you a direct order
not to speak to Frank Irving.

39:08.597 --> 39:11.100
Sheriff Reyes,
I did not mean to
undermine you in any way.

39:11.183 --> 39:12.810
And yet, you did.

39:19.817 --> 39:22.278
It seems one of us
will always be
out of her favor.

39:22.361 --> 39:23.362
Mmm.

39:23.863 --> 39:27.950
My sense is,
you did the right thing
with Captain Irving.

39:28.951 --> 39:30.202
You learn anything?

39:30.327 --> 39:31.620
Not enough.

39:32.621 --> 39:34.415
And I don't know how
we're gonna get near him now.

39:34.957 --> 39:39.587
Well, at the very least,
I'm grateful you arrived
when you did.

39:40.463 --> 39:43.549
And enchanted bullets.
Nice touch.
Mmm.

39:44.216 --> 39:45.760
You better text me
next time you decide

39:45.843 --> 39:47.595
to go jumping
into a painting.

39:56.896 --> 39:59.398
Lieutenant,
if you'll excuse me.

40:12.828 --> 40:16.791
All I could
think about tonight
was Abigail Adams.

40:18.334 --> 40:20.753
And then,
Abigail Mills appeared.

40:21.837 --> 40:24.507
One Abigail has
guided you to another.

40:26.675 --> 40:28.469
Like the Hanged Man,

40:30.054 --> 40:32.681
you and I have been
in a state of suspension,

40:33.182 --> 40:35.893
trapped in
the same old patterns,

40:36.769 --> 40:41.357
but the forces that have
kept us as such are gone.

40:43.526 --> 40:46.195
We will find
a new state of being.

40:48.948 --> 40:50.199
Together.

40:53.786 --> 40:54.870
Come.

41:12.096 --> 41:13.139
Ma'am...

41:13.722 --> 41:16.225
I know, it was wrong of me
to go around you
and speak to Frank...

41:16.308 --> 41:17.393
I get it, Mills.

41:17.601 --> 41:19.103
You're loyal to him.

41:19.186 --> 41:22.815
You've remained by his side
through everything
he's been accused of,

41:22.898 --> 41:24.692
and I've continued
to ask myself why.

41:24.775 --> 41:26.652
Is there something you know
that the rest us don't?

41:26.735 --> 41:29.029
And now,
I guess we're
gonna find out.

41:29.488 --> 41:30.739
What do you mean?

41:30.906 --> 41:32.116
The DA just called.

41:32.700 --> 41:36.370
They've received evidence
they say will
vindicate Frank Irving,

41:36.453 --> 41:39.748
so after all this,
he could go free.
