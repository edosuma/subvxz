(eerie electronic music)

00:18.656 --> 00:22.402
(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

00:22.402 --> 00:25.152
(floor creaking)

00:46.350 --> 00:49.350
(cash box clacking)

00:55.751 --> 00:58.501
(ominous music)

00:59.588 --> 01:00.755
- Who are you?

01:03.910 --> 01:08.293
Why are you in our house?
(eerie choral music)

01:15.621 --> 01:16.877
(Vincent whimpering)

01:16.877 --> 01:17.710
- Shh.

01:22.690 --> 01:23.523
It's a dream.

01:25.816 --> 01:26.760
(Vincent gulping)

01:26.760 --> 01:27.593
Go to bed.

01:36.700 --> 01:38.553
- [Vincent] Dad, Dad?

01:43.380 --> 01:44.860
- What is it?

01:44.860 --> 01:45.693
Oh, my God.

01:46.730 --> 01:48.550
Oh, my God, no.

01:48.550 --> 01:52.627
No, please, no.
(drawer clattering)

01:52.627 --> 01:54.070
Please no, please.

01:55.907 --> 01:57.197
Oh, my God, no.

01:57.197 --> 01:58.143
No, please.

02:04.280 --> 02:05.730
They took everything, Vinnie.

02:06.707 --> 02:07.624
Everything!

02:13.224 --> 02:14.307
We're ruined!

02:16.637 --> 02:20.121
Ruined!
(cash box clattering)

02:20.121 --> 02:21.134
(tense music)

02:21.134 --> 02:23.801
(Alvin crying)

02:29.294 --> 02:31.961
(hand thudding)

02:32.894 --> 02:36.293
(insects chirping)

02:36.293 --> 02:37.305
(gun firing)
(body thudding)

02:37.305 --> 02:40.055
(ominous music)

02:56.569 --> 02:59.486
(shotgun clacking)

03:07.721 --> 03:11.388
(dramatic vocalizing music)

03:26.980 --> 03:28.121
- Daddy, Daddy, come see.

03:28.121 --> 03:29.132
We think we saw a bear.

03:29.132 --> 03:29.965
(shotgun firing)

03:29.965 --> 03:33.465
(somber vocalizing music)

03:57.534 --> 04:00.867
(dramatic choral music)

04:33.403 --> 04:38.403
(clock ticking)
(dark music)

04:46.412 --> 04:49.495
(slow loud knocking)

04:54.030 --> 04:56.147
- It's the last photo we took of Kimberly

04:56.147 --> 04:57.755
before she disappeared.

04:57.755 --> 04:59.080
(gentle somber music)

04:59.080 --> 05:00.480
She's such a wonderful girl.

05:01.664 --> 05:04.073
She loves to write, paint.

05:05.210 --> 05:06.233
- And steal.

05:08.120 --> 05:09.970
Stealing never did stop, did it, Sam?

05:11.300 --> 05:14.940
- No, it didn't, Father,
and I blame myself.

05:14.940 --> 05:16.920
I should have been stronger.

05:16.920 --> 05:19.663
Less of a friend, more of a father.

05:23.384 --> 05:25.560
- Don't be too hard on yourself, Sam.

05:26.580 --> 05:30.150
It's not your fault.
(gentle music)

05:30.150 --> 05:32.203
- She was an addict and a thief.

05:33.357 --> 05:34.733
- But she's my baby girl.

05:35.710 --> 05:37.493
Love her despite her flaws.

05:37.493 --> 05:39.100
(moving to tense music)

05:39.100 --> 05:41.343
So, you haven't seen my Kimberly, Father?

05:42.820 --> 05:45.660
- [Vincent] I have not
seen your little girl, Sam.

05:45.660 --> 05:47.203
- You absolutely certain of that?

05:48.324 --> 05:50.080
- Yes, I am.

05:50.080 --> 05:53.450
- Well the reason I ask,
Father, is that Father Taylor,

05:53.450 --> 05:55.470
you know Father Taylor, don't ya?

05:55.470 --> 05:56.940
- Since we were children.

05:56.940 --> 05:58.670
- That's what I thought.

05:58.670 --> 06:01.460
He told me that she was
on her way to see you.

06:01.460 --> 06:02.770
She was always comfortable discussing

06:02.770 --> 06:04.707
her ongoing issues with you.

06:04.707 --> 06:07.653
- Oh, I'm very pleased to
hear that she felt that way.

06:08.557 --> 06:11.973
I really am, but she never
made it to Safehaven.

06:13.350 --> 06:16.590
- You know, Father, that's
the damnedest thing of all

06:17.780 --> 06:20.313
because my little girl
did make it to Safehaven.

06:21.200 --> 06:23.360
She sent us this memento.

06:23.360 --> 06:25.643
Missing you both, love, K.

06:26.670 --> 06:28.287
That's how Kimberly signed off.

06:28.287 --> 06:31.520
And it was sent from
Safehaven, Mississippi.

06:31.520 --> 06:34.510
That's where you boys are from, isn't it?

06:34.510 --> 06:36.610
- [Vincent] It is our base.

06:36.610 --> 06:37.960
- That's what they tell me.

06:39.387 --> 06:41.797
And it seems you were there
when my daughter was there.

06:41.797 --> 06:42.930
(eerie music)

06:42.930 --> 06:45.563
Now, I don't have a lot of money,

06:46.580 --> 06:48.880
but I'm gonna hire a private investigator.

06:48.880 --> 06:51.497
I can't see any other way
to find out where my...

06:51.497 --> 06:52.330
(gun firing)

06:52.330 --> 06:56.608
(blood spattering)
(eerie electronic music)

06:56.608 --> 06:59.863
(body thudding)

06:59.863 --> 07:00.768
- Why?

07:00.768 --> 07:03.157
(tense music)

07:03.157 --> 07:04.997
- Oh, no, what was that?

07:04.997 --> 07:05.830
(gun firing)

07:05.830 --> 07:07.635
(dishes clattering)

07:07.635 --> 07:09.052
- God, fuck, man!

07:10.675 --> 07:12.304
What is wrong with you?

07:12.304 --> 07:13.471
We have to go!

07:16.541 --> 07:17.624
Vincent, now!

07:21.613 --> 07:22.446
(fan clattering)

07:22.446 --> 07:25.779
(dramatic choral music)

07:29.269 --> 07:30.529
What the fuck is wrong with you?

07:30.529 --> 07:32.510
We have to go, come on.

07:32.510 --> 07:33.510
Vincent now!

07:34.449 --> 07:36.740
Vincent, we have to go, come on!

07:36.740 --> 07:37.573
Go!

07:41.340 --> 07:44.007
(ominous music)

07:46.311 --> 07:48.894
(eerie music)

08:03.551 --> 08:06.968
(gentle music box music)

08:08.240 --> 08:10.907
(chaotic music)

08:17.186 --> 08:19.936
(ominous music)

08:44.386 --> 08:46.969
(birds cooing)

08:50.735 --> 08:53.818
(ratchet clattering)

08:55.812 --> 08:57.551
(tools clacking)

08:57.551 --> 08:59.350
(Vincent clearing throat)

08:59.350 --> 09:00.790
- [Michael] Good mornin'.

09:00.790 --> 09:01.623
- Is it?

09:02.917 --> 09:04.730
Did you take care of our problem?

09:04.730 --> 09:06.900
- I'm patchin' it up again.

09:06.900 --> 09:08.070
All right, but she's
not gonna hold together

09:08.070 --> 09:09.260
too much longer.

09:09.260 --> 09:11.380
We still need to get a new engine.

09:11.380 --> 09:15.020
- Nope, what we need is a
more competent mechanic.

09:15.020 --> 09:17.580
- Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

09:17.580 --> 09:19.510
- How long since your last confession?

09:19.510 --> 09:20.880
- I was here last week, Father.

09:20.880 --> 09:22.597
You don't remember?
(ominous music)

09:22.597 --> 09:24.053
- No, we don't keep score.

09:25.100 --> 09:26.450
Carry on.

09:26.450 --> 09:27.423
What are your sins?

09:28.330 --> 09:29.513
- Perversion, Father.

09:30.960 --> 09:33.080
Lustin' after my neighbor.
(suspenseful music)

09:33.080 --> 09:34.103
- How many times?

09:34.970 --> 09:35.970
- Too many to count.

09:37.340 --> 09:39.403
- Does she know of your lust?

09:40.954 --> 09:42.223
- No, no, Father,

09:43.790 --> 09:45.400
it's a he.

09:45.400 --> 09:47.240
That's what makes it so terrible.

09:47.240 --> 09:49.280
- Let the Lord be the judge of that.

09:49.280 --> 09:51.173
Does he know of your intentions?

09:52.170 --> 09:56.283
- No, Father, I, I put a
spy cam up in his house.

09:57.176 --> 10:01.050
- Oh, well, that's worse
than the first part.

10:01.050 --> 10:01.883
- You think so?

10:02.750 --> 10:04.750
- You'll burn for it without absolution.

10:05.700 --> 10:06.773
- I'm sorry, Father.

10:08.170 --> 10:09.650
- Is there anything else you wanna add?

10:09.650 --> 10:12.000
Please tell me you purchased
the spy cam at least?

10:12.000 --> 10:14.577
- Oh, oh, I did, Father, online.

10:14.577 --> 10:17.446
I used a coupon, got 35% off.

10:17.446 --> 10:19.593
- Oh, well that works in your favor.

10:20.860 --> 10:22.210
Well, very well.

10:22.210 --> 10:23.230
For these sins--

10:23.230 --> 10:24.677
- All the other ones, I forgot, Father,

10:24.677 --> 10:26.583
but I am truly sorry.

10:27.587 --> 10:28.830
- Do you realize what you're doing

10:28.830 --> 10:31.574
is an invasion of another man's privacy?

10:31.574 --> 10:32.830
I want you to examine your conscience

10:32.830 --> 10:35.190
before such behavior again.

10:35.190 --> 10:36.550
- Yes, Father.

10:36.550 --> 10:39.253
- For penance, 12 Hail
Marys, six Our Fathers.

10:40.320 --> 10:41.560
And I want you to remove the spy cam

10:41.560 --> 10:44.060
from your neighbor's house immediately.

10:44.060 --> 10:46.380
- What if my neighbor's home, Father?

10:46.380 --> 10:47.490
- You were able to install it

10:47.490 --> 10:49.290
without getting caught, weren't you?

10:50.360 --> 10:52.204
- Yes, Father.

10:52.204 --> 10:53.736
- Go in peace.

10:53.736 --> 10:56.569
(birds chirping)

10:57.986 --> 11:00.569
(gentle music)

11:21.233 --> 11:22.960
(moving to tense music)

11:22.960 --> 11:24.440
- You don't express dissatisfaction

11:24.440 --> 11:26.740
with a person by stealing
from them, ma'am.

11:26.740 --> 11:28.240
- But I feel nothing but resentment

11:28.240 --> 11:30.290
for my daughter's fiance, Father.

11:30.290 --> 11:32.530
- Why do you feel this way about him?

11:32.530 --> 11:34.640
- He's two-faced, he has other women.

11:34.640 --> 11:37.200
I, I never trusted him.

11:37.200 --> 11:38.510
Look, I know this is wrong,

11:38.510 --> 11:42.660
but I want him out of her life.

11:42.660 --> 11:44.610
- That's why you steal from his wallet?

11:47.280 --> 11:50.043
- I knew that money was the
only thing that mattered to him.

11:50.890 --> 11:52.820
- Do you realize what you're saying?

11:52.820 --> 11:55.310
This is not the philosophy
of a Christian woman.

11:55.310 --> 11:57.340
Your daughter made a
choice to be with this man.

11:57.340 --> 11:59.290
If she loves him and is committed to him,

11:59.290 --> 12:00.580
then you must accept.

12:00.580 --> 12:01.440
- I can't, Father.

12:01.440 --> 12:03.150
I, I can't.

12:03.150 --> 12:04.600
- You must!

12:04.600 --> 12:06.423
- It's difficult for me, Father.

12:09.650 --> 12:10.900
- Then make a contrition.

12:12.280 --> 12:15.800
- For these sins that I have committed,

12:15.800 --> 12:20.800
and those that I have forgotten, sorry.

12:20.826 --> 12:22.070
(Vincent sighing)

12:22.070 --> 12:23.850
- That was half-hearted.

12:23.850 --> 12:25.153
Allow me.

12:25.153 --> 12:27.090
(door clattering)

12:27.090 --> 12:28.550
- Father?
(ominous music)

12:28.550 --> 12:30.180
- Through this ministry,

12:30.180 --> 12:32.426
may God grant you pardon and peace.

12:32.426 --> 12:33.607
(woman grunting)

12:33.607 --> 12:34.840
(somber music)

12:34.840 --> 12:36.630
I absolve you of your sins,

12:36.630 --> 12:39.900
in the name of the Father,
Son, and The Holy Ghost.

12:40.825 --> 12:43.575
(woman grunting)

12:44.807 --> 12:48.140
(dramatic choral music)

12:56.844 --> 12:57.677
Run.

13:01.066 --> 13:05.149
(singing in a foreign language)

13:09.065 --> 13:12.065
(machete thudding)

13:35.415 --> 13:37.998
(somber music)

13:55.506 --> 13:58.089
(tense music)

14:08.160 --> 14:11.060
- [Marty] This is Marty
Midnight on Beyond Midnight

14:11.060 --> 14:14.290
from WMGO, River Radio.

14:14.290 --> 14:15.920
We have Pariah on the line.

14:15.920 --> 14:17.270
She's joining us this morning

14:17.270 --> 14:19.480
from Yazoo City, Mississippi.

14:19.480 --> 14:21.543
How's life on the dark side, sister?

14:22.974 --> 14:25.391
- You know, it's good, Marty.

14:27.250 --> 14:29.767
- [Marty] Are you staying out of trouble?

14:29.767 --> 14:33.350
- Trouble's much too good to stay out of.

14:33.350 --> 14:34.350
- [Marty] What's new?

14:34.350 --> 14:36.023
You still wanted in five states?

14:37.866 --> 14:38.966
- [Mary] I'm not sure.

14:40.156 --> 14:40.989
(rock thudding)

14:40.989 --> 14:42.072
I lost count.

14:43.684 --> 14:45.520
- (chuckles) So, what do you have

14:45.520 --> 14:47.570
to confess tonight, my dear?

14:47.570 --> 14:50.141
You know there's no judgment here.

14:50.141 --> 14:52.724
- [Mary] Well, I dumped my man.

14:56.454 --> 14:58.054
- [Marty] Again?

14:58.054 --> 15:00.434
- [Mary] Different man.

15:00.434 --> 15:02.040
- [Marty] (laughing) Of course.

15:02.040 --> 15:03.003
Tell me more.

15:04.225 --> 15:05.920
- [Mary] I got bored.

15:05.920 --> 15:08.334
- [Vincent] Whatever
you are, man or monster.

15:08.334 --> 15:09.293
- [Mary] I didn't like his voice.

15:09.293 --> 15:11.834
- [Vincent] Receive these
wretched souls into paradise.

15:11.834 --> 15:16.060
- I got restless, Marty.

15:16.060 --> 15:19.610
- Well, a girl's gotta do
what a girl's gotta do.

15:19.610 --> 15:23.650
- I wanted something that
no living man can give me.

15:25.294 --> 15:28.853
- [Marty] Now ya got me
really feeling inadequate.

15:28.853 --> 15:30.113
- [Mary] So I killed him.

15:31.323 --> 15:33.363
- You killed him?

15:34.489 --> 15:35.656
- Is that bad?

15:36.540 --> 15:39.760
- Who am I to nail you
to a cross, my precious?

15:39.760 --> 15:43.010
Ladies break up with us
these days by email or text.

15:43.010 --> 15:45.420
You keep it Old Testament.

15:45.420 --> 15:47.116
I respect that.

15:47.116 --> 15:52.116
(Mary moaning)
(tense music)

15:56.402 --> 15:59.112
(Mary groaning)

15:59.112 --> 16:01.695
(Mary panting)

16:04.762 --> 16:07.929
(gentle choral music)

16:26.041 --> 16:26.874
(explosion booming)

16:26.874 --> 16:31.874
(ominous music)
(woman coughing)

16:32.373 --> 16:35.040
(woman gasping)

17:05.137 --> 17:07.310
(woman choking)

17:07.310 --> 17:10.893
(moving to dramatic music)

17:25.193 --> 17:26.593
- Checkout's at 11.

17:26.593 --> 17:29.260
(woman choking)

17:33.868 --> 17:36.368
(tense music)

18:02.689 --> 18:05.939
(customers chattering)

18:07.607 --> 18:10.980
(gentle music)

18:10.980 --> 18:11.813
- Hi, Michael.

18:11.813 --> 18:12.950
- Hi, Ruby.

18:12.950 --> 18:14.070
- How are you?

18:14.070 --> 18:14.920
- I'm better now.

18:16.120 --> 18:17.973
Uh, happy birthday.

18:17.973 --> 18:19.377
It's your birthday, right?

18:19.377 --> 18:20.550
- Mmm hmm.

18:20.550 --> 18:21.483
Stay right there.

18:24.810 --> 18:27.130
I have something for you, too.

18:27.130 --> 18:28.377
- It's your birthday, not mine.

18:28.377 --> 18:29.210
(Ruby chuckling)

18:29.210 --> 18:30.640
- I know, open it.

18:30.640 --> 18:31.473
- All right.

18:38.225 --> 18:39.725
- Let me help you.

18:43.030 --> 18:44.160
- Oh, wow.

18:44.160 --> 18:44.993
- Try it on.

18:48.720 --> 18:49.600
I love it.

18:49.600 --> 18:50.433
(laughing)

18:50.433 --> 18:51.266
- Yeah?

18:52.273 --> 18:53.287
- It looks good.

18:53.287 --> 18:54.972
(horn honking)

18:54.972 --> 18:56.880
- Oh, I'm sorry, I gotta run, okay?

18:56.880 --> 18:57.730
I'll see ya soon.

18:59.164 --> 19:02.030
Oh.

19:02.030 --> 19:02.863
I almost forgot.

19:02.863 --> 19:05.333
Um, happy birthday again.

19:07.332 --> 19:08.165
- Oh, uh.

19:08.165 --> 19:08.998
- Bye.

19:08.998 --> 19:09.831
- Bye.

19:17.499 --> 19:19.916
(Ruby gasps)

19:24.358 --> 19:27.398
(Ruby sighing)

19:27.398 --> 19:29.731
(chuckles)

19:30.758 --> 19:34.091
(dramatic choral music)

19:41.680 --> 19:43.870
- Forgive me, Padre, for I have sinned.

19:43.870 --> 19:45.230
I really need forgiveness.

19:45.230 --> 19:48.230
I took a bribe while I
was on the city council,

19:48.230 --> 19:50.240
and I feel terrible, I need forgiveness.

19:50.240 --> 19:51.558
Please, forgive me.

19:51.558 --> 19:52.796
(motorcycle engine rumbling)

19:52.796 --> 19:56.713
(gentle acoustic guitar music)

20:29.440 --> 20:31.513
- Wish I could do more.

20:31.513 --> 20:33.579
I know it's not much.

20:33.579 --> 20:34.880
- (chuckles) It's all right.

20:34.880 --> 20:37.528
Uh, we got plenty more
back at the tabernacle.

20:37.528 --> 20:40.390
- Hmm, your church?
(tense music)

20:40.390 --> 20:42.390
- Um, no, that's what we call our house.

20:49.797 --> 20:50.630
Please.

20:54.630 --> 20:55.463
Thank you.

21:09.070 --> 21:10.380
- So who's we?

21:10.380 --> 21:11.410
- My brother and I.

21:11.410 --> 21:12.996
We live together.

21:12.996 --> 21:14.246
- That's sweet.

21:15.276 --> 21:16.825
At the tabernacle?

21:16.825 --> 21:17.658
- Yeah.

21:24.069 --> 21:27.180
- So what's going on in there?

21:27.180 --> 21:28.013
- My brother's a priest.

21:28.013 --> 21:30.203
He's in there hearing
confessions right now.

21:31.292 --> 21:33.323
- So you guys actually have a church?

21:34.470 --> 21:35.620
- You're looking at it.

21:39.390 --> 21:41.440
- I'd like to meet this brother of yours.

21:44.360 --> 21:45.193
- Hop in line.

21:48.660 --> 21:53.660
- Maybe another time.
(upbeat music)

21:58.470 --> 21:59.743
Thanks for the chitchat.

22:01.690 --> 22:04.410
- I stole money from an old lady.

22:04.410 --> 22:06.800
A neighbor.
(somber music)

22:06.800 --> 22:07.963
I have a drug habit.

22:09.399 --> 22:10.823
I needed a fix.

22:12.290 --> 22:13.360
I feel terrible about it

22:13.360 --> 22:15.503
but I had no choice.

22:18.090 --> 22:19.743
And I know it's wrong.

22:20.850 --> 22:23.000
And I'm asking you for
forgiveness, Father.

22:23.850 --> 22:26.350
- You put your needs above
that of that poor soul?

22:27.330 --> 22:28.163
- Yes, Father.

22:29.160 --> 22:31.233
Yes, but I want God's forgiveness.

22:33.760 --> 22:35.763
I know what I did.

22:38.422 --> 22:40.440
(ominous music)

22:40.440 --> 22:41.273
Father?

22:43.580 --> 22:46.103
Father, aren't you gonna say anything?

22:48.774 --> 22:50.540
(door rattling)

22:50.540 --> 22:52.560
- Proverbs 10:2.

22:52.560 --> 22:54.440
Treasures gained by
wickedness do not profit

22:54.440 --> 22:56.766
but righteousness delivers from death.

22:56.766 --> 22:58.925
(dramatic eerie music)

22:58.925 --> 23:01.508
(man grunting)

23:03.544 --> 23:05.432
(body thudding)

23:05.432 --> 23:06.870
(somber choral music)

23:06.870 --> 23:08.620
You have God's forgiveness, my son.

23:09.720 --> 23:11.120
May death be your salvation.

23:14.004 --> 23:16.810
(gentle music)
(birds chirping)

23:16.810 --> 23:17.710
- Morning, friend.

23:19.250 --> 23:20.083
- Morning.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.320
- Sorry to intrude.

23:23.320 --> 23:26.090
I'm looking for some fellas
that used to live here.

23:26.090 --> 23:28.550
A Michael and a Vincent.

23:28.550 --> 23:31.501
You might have known the second
fellow as Father Vincent.

23:31.501 --> 23:32.910
- Hmm, priest, huh?

23:34.770 --> 23:38.090
I recall some talk of a couple
fellas living here once.

23:38.090 --> 23:39.930
Never knew their names.

23:39.930 --> 23:42.310
- And how long have
you lived here, friend?

23:42.310 --> 23:43.860
- Oh, about 10 years, I reckon.

23:45.167 --> 23:47.053
All right, I appreciate it.

23:49.900 --> 23:51.103
- You a detective?

23:52.938 --> 23:54.200
What did that priest fella do?

23:54.200 --> 23:56.170
Diddle one of those altar boys?

24:00.220 --> 24:02.150
- I'm a priest myself.

24:02.150 --> 24:05.073
Some of us still make it our
business to act like one.

24:06.120 --> 24:07.220
God bless you, friend.

24:10.311 --> 24:12.811
(tense music)

24:20.907 --> 24:23.460
- And he must realize his guilt

24:23.460 --> 24:25.370
and restore what he took in full,

24:25.370 --> 24:27.640
and add a fifth to it, and give it him

24:27.640 --> 24:31.120
who it belong on the day
he realizes his guilt.

24:31.120 --> 24:33.203
If not, he shall be put to death.

24:34.681 --> 24:37.980
And we all work hard to
provide for our families

24:37.980 --> 24:41.200
and put bread on the table
and roof over our heads.

24:41.200 --> 24:44.350
And these heathens,
these godless vultures,

24:44.350 --> 24:48.900
take from us the bounty which
God has graciously provided.

24:48.900 --> 24:50.243
No, they must pay for the sins

24:50.243 --> 24:52.670
with their blood and the
blood of their children.

24:52.670 --> 24:53.774
Can I get an amen?

24:53.774 --> 24:55.441
- [Worshipers] Amen.

24:56.500 --> 24:58.733
- Zachariah 5:3.

24:59.875 --> 25:03.290
Then he said to me, this is the curse

25:03.290 --> 25:05.860
that goes forth over the
whole face of the land.

25:05.860 --> 25:09.340
Surely everyone who steals
shall be purged away.

25:09.340 --> 25:12.214
I will make you go forth
declares the Lord of hosts.

25:12.214 --> 25:13.047
(feedback screeching)

25:13.047 --> 25:15.970
(worshipers gasping)

25:15.970 --> 25:19.020
We will, we will enter
the house of thieves,

25:19.020 --> 25:20.700
and we will stay in that house,

25:20.700 --> 25:23.864
and we will consume it
with timber and stones.

25:23.864 --> 25:24.697
(feedback screeching)

25:24.697 --> 25:25.530
(worshipers gasping)

25:25.530 --> 25:26.562
- [Man] Oh I can't.

25:26.562 --> 25:30.482
- Folks, folks, please, I'm sorry.

25:30.482 --> 25:31.841
Folks, please, please.

25:31.841 --> 25:33.550
(feedback screeching)

25:33.550 --> 25:35.060
Please, folks, stay.

25:35.060 --> 25:35.893
Please.

25:37.351 --> 25:39.760
(grunting)

25:39.760 --> 25:41.300
What is wrong with you,
you incompetent idiot?

25:41.300 --> 25:42.710
I thought you had the sound fixed.

25:42.710 --> 25:44.820
- I checked it earlier, it was fine.

25:44.820 --> 25:45.653
- Oh yeah?

25:45.653 --> 25:46.770
Clearly not!

25:46.770 --> 25:48.695
- I, I'm sorry, shit happens.

25:48.695 --> 25:50.695
- (grunts) Little good that does us now.

25:53.620 --> 25:56.745
- You really are an
ungrateful prick, aren't you?

25:56.745 --> 25:57.578
(slap thudding)

25:57.578 --> 25:58.770
(Vincent grunting)

25:58.770 --> 26:00.360
- Get out my face!

26:00.360 --> 26:02.010
Your presence is offensive to me.

26:07.064 --> 26:07.897
(feedback screeching)

26:07.897 --> 26:10.936
(ominous music)

26:10.936 --> 26:12.603
- Here you go, Mike.

26:14.200 --> 26:15.200
It's the last piece.

26:16.880 --> 26:19.570
- Oh, yeah, I didn't order any pie, Ruby.

26:19.570 --> 26:21.770
- I know, I thought you'd like it.

26:21.770 --> 26:23.070
I know it's your favorite.

26:27.459 --> 26:29.959
- Oh, that's sweet, thank you.

26:30.813 --> 26:33.433
- So, what happened to your face?

26:34.570 --> 26:35.493
Did you fall down?

26:39.800 --> 26:42.503
- Yeah, something like that.

26:45.660 --> 26:47.510
- Michael's always been a bit clumsy.

26:49.877 --> 26:51.623
- Do you want me to get some ice for ya?

26:52.680 --> 26:55.313
- No, thanks, I'll deal
with it when we go home.

26:59.750 --> 27:01.580
- You are going to put this piece of pie

27:01.580 --> 27:02.830
on our check, aren't you?

27:04.990 --> 27:06.253
- No, it's on the house.

27:07.720 --> 27:11.820
- So, you own this restaurant?

27:11.820 --> 27:15.113
- No, I just work here.

27:16.460 --> 27:19.190
- Then you don't own this piece of pie.

27:19.190 --> 27:21.420
You're stealing something you don't own

27:21.420 --> 27:23.437
and you're giving it to Michael.

27:23.437 --> 27:25.230
- (sighs) Uh, you boys are regulars.

27:25.230 --> 27:26.730
I never really thought about it like that.

27:26.730 --> 27:29.797
- Well maybe you should
because that's the way it is.

27:29.797 --> 27:31.780
(Ruby sighing)

27:31.780 --> 27:34.820
Say, why don't you come
by the van tomorrow

27:34.820 --> 27:37.260
for a confession, and I
can clarify the morality

27:37.260 --> 27:38.393
of your sins.
- No.

27:40.260 --> 27:42.110
She doesn't have anything to confess.

27:43.110 --> 27:44.603
- Are you Catholic, Ruby?

27:45.720 --> 27:47.255
- Uh, I'm lapsed.

27:47.255 --> 27:50.300
(chuckles) I haven't been
to a church in years.

27:50.300 --> 27:51.860
- Well, that's okay.

27:51.860 --> 27:54.260
Once a Catholic, always a Catholic.

27:54.260 --> 27:55.093
Right, brother?

27:56.150 --> 27:58.476
- I'm not so sure about that.

27:58.476 --> 28:00.710
- (chuckles) You're not so sure, are you?

28:00.710 --> 28:01.560
Why would you be?

28:03.200 --> 28:04.580
- Ruby's a good girl.

28:04.580 --> 28:07.590
She doesn't have anything
to confess, so drop it.

28:07.590 --> 28:08.820
- Nobody's good, child.

28:08.820 --> 28:10.520
Not in the bones.

28:10.520 --> 28:13.220
It is something we try on
like a coat that never fits.

28:14.290 --> 28:17.570
Now put this piece of pie on our check

28:19.120 --> 28:20.780
and when you're ready to come see me,

28:20.780 --> 28:22.763
confession is your road to redemption.

28:24.977 --> 28:26.644
- Thank you, Father.

28:38.896 --> 28:42.377
(ominous music)

28:42.377 --> 28:44.250
- Pass her and pull over.

28:44.250 --> 28:45.760
- Leave her alone, Vincent.

28:45.760 --> 28:47.150
Take it out on me instead.

28:47.150 --> 28:48.480
- Take what out on you?

28:48.480 --> 28:51.010
There's a soul out
there, I'm gonna save it.

28:51.010 --> 28:51.843
- Bet you are.

28:52.860 --> 28:54.483
- Just pull over.

28:54.483 --> 28:56.983
(tense music)

29:21.990 --> 29:23.747
Hot enough for you?

29:23.747 --> 29:25.880
- Uh, yeah, it's plenty hot enough

29:25.880 --> 29:28.968
but it's the wind that will kill you.

29:28.968 --> 29:31.135
- Yeah, so, what happened?

29:32.758 --> 29:35.570
- Uh, sprocket teeth stripped.

29:35.570 --> 29:38.424
I tried to call for help, but
there's no service out here.

29:38.424 --> 29:39.983
- Yeah, it's hit or miss.

29:40.860 --> 29:43.663
So could we give you a ride?

29:45.170 --> 29:46.610
- Uh, I don't know.

29:46.610 --> 29:49.430
I don't make it a habit
of riding with strangers.

29:49.430 --> 29:50.273
- That's smart.

29:53.350 --> 29:56.100
- Well, it's a sound policy
but I'm a man of the cloth.

29:57.400 --> 29:59.003
- You are a real priest?

29:59.840 --> 30:01.150
- As real as the air is fresh,

30:01.150 --> 30:02.880
spreading hope and absolution
to fellow travelers

30:02.880 --> 30:03.713
of the road.

30:05.476 --> 30:06.423
Are you Catholic?

30:07.520 --> 30:09.180
- Uh, my parents are.

30:09.180 --> 30:11.180
I haven't been to church in a long time.

30:12.090 --> 30:13.440
- You ever done confession?

30:15.010 --> 30:16.903
- A few times when I was younger.

30:17.771 --> 30:19.960
- Huh, well I'll tell you what,

30:19.960 --> 30:22.490
we'll give you a ride into
town for a confession.

30:22.490 --> 30:23.323
Deal?

30:24.840 --> 30:28.497
- Uh, what would I have to do?

30:28.497 --> 30:29.390
- Just step into the confessional.

30:29.390 --> 30:30.863
I'll talk you through it.

30:32.527 --> 30:34.360
- What about my bike?

30:57.337 --> 31:00.550
- All right please begin
by telling me your sins.

31:00.550 --> 31:03.030
Just be honest and confess them all.

31:03.030 --> 31:05.050
The Lord is ready to forgive you.

31:05.050 --> 31:08.404
- Wait, isn't there something
I'm supposed to say first?

31:08.404 --> 31:11.240
- (sighing) Normally, yes,
but I'm not so formal.

31:11.240 --> 31:13.483
Just describe your sins, please.

31:14.500 --> 31:16.290
- Uh, okay, um...

31:19.380 --> 31:22.900
Well, I drink too much

31:22.900 --> 31:26.363
and I smoke weed.

31:27.295 --> 31:28.903
- Uh huh, please continue.

31:31.890 --> 31:33.373
- My grandma died last year.

31:34.756 --> 31:37.006
I didn't go to the funeral.

31:39.620 --> 31:42.783
I lied to my mom and told
her my car broke down.

31:43.990 --> 31:46.445
- Uh huh, go on my child.

31:46.445 --> 31:47.362
Is that it?

31:56.292 --> 31:57.125
Well?

31:58.003 --> 32:01.430
- I, I stole money from my sister

32:01.430 --> 32:02.780
so I could go on this trip.

32:05.250 --> 32:06.120
We've never gotten along

32:06.120 --> 32:08.993
so I don't really feel that bad about it.

32:11.790 --> 32:14.301
I guess that's the worst stuff.

32:14.301 --> 32:16.250
- You think it's okay to steal money?

32:16.250 --> 32:18.342
Especially from your own flesh and blood?

32:18.342 --> 32:20.712
- No, I don't think it's good.

32:20.712 --> 32:24.390
(moving to dramatic music)

32:24.390 --> 32:25.910
She's a bitch.

32:25.910 --> 32:29.020
- The seventh commandment
says, though shall not steal.

32:29.020 --> 32:30.780
Proverbs 10:2.

32:30.780 --> 32:32.660
Treasures gained by
wickedness do not profit

32:32.660 --> 32:34.210
but righteousness delivers from death!

32:34.210 --> 32:37.760
- Okay, I, I, I'm sorry.

32:37.760 --> 32:39.480
I'm really sorry.

32:39.480 --> 32:41.973
- Lying lips are an
abomination to the Lord!

32:43.620 --> 32:45.410
- Can we, can we stop the van?

32:45.410 --> 32:47.142
I don't wanna, I don't
wanna do this anymore.

32:47.142 --> 32:48.653
I, I wanna get out.

32:50.800 --> 32:52.828
(door clattering)

32:52.828 --> 32:55.995
- Death is your salvation, sweetheart.

33:17.451 --> 33:21.522
(police siren wailing)

33:21.522 --> 33:23.022
- Vincent?

33:23.022 --> 33:23.855
Vincent!

33:26.849 --> 33:27.932
What do I do?

33:34.221 --> 33:36.804
(tense music)

34:05.152 --> 34:07.902
(ominous music)

34:23.733 --> 34:25.760
- Good morning, Michael.

34:25.760 --> 34:27.190
- [Michael] Hey, Sheriff.

34:27.190 --> 34:28.080
- How goes it?

34:28.080 --> 34:30.092
- Uh, I'm doing real good, real good.

34:31.610 --> 34:32.860
Did I do something wrong?

34:34.170 --> 34:36.643
- I don't know, did ya?

34:39.080 --> 34:39.913
Nah, I'm just kiddin' ya.

34:39.913 --> 34:41.449
No, you didn't do anything wrong

34:41.449 --> 34:42.920
but I need to speak to
you and your brother.

34:42.920 --> 34:43.820
Is he in the back?

34:45.150 --> 34:45.983
- Yes, sir.

35:04.360 --> 35:06.070
- Morning, Sheriff.

35:06.070 --> 35:07.710
What can we do for you this fine morning?

35:07.710 --> 35:09.820
- Hello, Father, how are you?

35:09.820 --> 35:11.040
- I'm blessed.

35:11.040 --> 35:12.270
So why did you pull us over?

35:12.270 --> 35:14.220
Michael driving too slow again?

35:14.220 --> 35:15.053
- Nah.

35:15.053 --> 35:15.886
(chuckling)

35:15.886 --> 35:17.500
No, no, he's driving just fine.

35:17.500 --> 35:18.660
No, but I need to talk to you boys.

35:18.660 --> 35:20.260
There's been another disappearance.

35:20.260 --> 35:21.093
Another girl.

35:22.050 --> 35:23.350
- Oh.
(tense music)

35:23.350 --> 35:25.350
- She was up here about a week ago.

35:25.350 --> 35:28.680
Around 20 years old, blonde, pretty.

35:28.680 --> 35:29.903
Riding a purple bicycle.

35:30.871 --> 35:33.203
Well, here, take a look.

35:39.700 --> 35:42.990
- Oh, well, they all kinda look

35:42.990 --> 35:44.710
a lot alike around here.

35:44.710 --> 35:46.177
Have you seen her?

35:48.011 --> 35:52.070
(moving to ominous music)

35:52.070 --> 35:54.420
- They all look the same
to me, I'm, I'm sorry.

35:55.300 --> 35:56.230
- Well, all right,
(tense music)

35:56.230 --> 35:57.860
but if you boys see anything suspicious,

35:57.860 --> 35:59.160
you'll let me know, right?

36:02.120 --> 36:02.953
- Absolutely.

36:05.090 --> 36:08.900
Nothing more suspicious than
us around these parts, huh?

36:08.900 --> 36:10.200
- I reckon you're right,

36:10.200 --> 36:11.750
but keep an eye out for me, okay?

36:11.750 --> 36:13.230
You still got my number?

36:13.230 --> 36:14.220
- Yes, sir.

36:14.220 --> 36:15.120
- All right, then.

36:18.370 --> 36:20.940
Say, since I'm here and all, you boys mind

36:20.940 --> 36:23.170
if I take a quick look in the back?

36:23.170 --> 36:24.850
Strictly routine.

36:24.850 --> 36:27.253
- Uh, no, go, go ahead.

36:31.441 --> 36:34.941
(moving to ominous music)

36:45.751 --> 36:48.084
- Hot damn, I shoulda known.

36:48.950 --> 36:51.202
Nothin' in there but the Holy Spirit.

36:51.202 --> 36:52.252
- You got that right.

36:55.610 --> 36:58.163
Uh, Sheriff, while you're here,

36:59.860 --> 37:01.700
wanna do a confessional?

37:01.700 --> 37:04.180
- You don't have enough time
to hear all my sins, Vincent.

37:04.180 --> 37:06.050
Besides, I'm not Catholic.

37:06.050 --> 37:07.950
- Well, I won't hold that against you.

37:09.377 --> 37:10.803
If you change your mind.

37:13.000 --> 37:16.053
- All right but you boys
be safe out there, okay?

37:16.053 --> 37:18.773
There's a lot of nut bags on these roads.

37:23.050 --> 37:25.441
(crickets chirping)

37:25.441 --> 37:28.108
(ominous music)

37:46.743 --> 37:48.826
- I could go for a drink.

37:49.983 --> 37:51.710
- Me, too.

37:51.710 --> 37:55.493
- Great, why don't you go
whip us up both one then.

38:04.142 --> 38:07.225
(somber piano music)

38:14.390 --> 38:17.723
(dramatic choral music)

38:37.292 --> 38:39.790
- Thought you might
enjoy a little bit of...

38:39.790 --> 38:41.040
What the hell are you doing?

38:41.040 --> 38:42.653
- For Heaven's sakes, Michael!

38:43.610 --> 38:44.692
Thought you were getting the drinks.

38:44.692 --> 38:45.740
(tense music)

38:45.740 --> 38:48.340
- Yeah, and I thought you
were done doing that shit.

38:49.524 --> 38:51.630
- What are you talking about?

38:51.630 --> 38:53.840
- Don't pretend like this is
the first time you've done this

38:53.840 --> 38:56.073
to one of these girls.
- What's your problem Michael?

38:56.073 --> 38:58.190
Are you seeing things again?

38:58.190 --> 38:59.943
Is your imagination running wild?

39:01.430 --> 39:02.263
- What?

39:02.263 --> 39:03.096
(tense music)

39:03.096 --> 39:06.810
- I mean, the nerve of these accusations.

39:06.810 --> 39:08.200
- What the hell are you talking about?

39:08.200 --> 39:12.110
I just saw you with your
hand up inside of her.

39:12.110 --> 39:15.320
- I don't think I can
trust you anymore, brother.

39:15.320 --> 39:18.013
You used to have my back
and now I'm not so sure.

39:19.284 --> 39:20.910
Look, I don't ask much of you.

39:20.910 --> 39:24.170
Just to help me set up each
day, do the collections,

39:24.170 --> 39:26.995
keep the van running, and
you can't even do that right.

39:26.995 --> 39:27.930
(ominous music)

39:27.930 --> 39:29.250
- You're unbelievable.

39:29.250 --> 39:31.570
How is it my fault that you
don't wanna fix the engine?

39:31.570 --> 39:33.430
Okay, you're the tight ass who
won't put any money into it.

39:33.430 --> 39:34.640
We have plenty of money.

39:34.640 --> 39:36.093
- It's not our money!

39:37.590 --> 39:40.580
Until we recover every single
dollar that was stolen,

39:40.580 --> 39:42.123
Dad won't rest in peace.

39:43.810 --> 39:45.410
And maybe then he'll forgive me.

39:46.520 --> 39:48.330
- Forgive you, it wasn't
your goddamn fault.

39:48.330 --> 39:49.480
You were a fucking kid.

39:50.320 --> 39:52.260
- It was my fault!

39:52.260 --> 39:53.930
Look, I was weak!

39:53.930 --> 39:56.010
I should have done something!

39:56.010 --> 39:58.830
- This has been the same
fucking song for 20 years.

39:58.830 --> 39:59.673
Get over it!

40:02.110 --> 40:03.978
Fucking every touch me again!

40:03.978 --> 40:07.311
(dramatic eerie music)

40:30.328 --> 40:32.995
(somber music)

40:33.979 --> 40:35.110
You know, it wouldn't hurt

40:35.110 --> 40:36.600
to put some money into the van, Vincent.

40:36.600 --> 40:39.423
This piece of crap's going to hell.

40:40.290 --> 40:42.440
- It wouldn't if it
was our money, brother.

40:44.197 --> 40:47.499
(motorcycle engine rumbling)

40:47.499 --> 40:50.749
(dramatic eerie music)

40:59.029 --> 41:02.446
(moving to somber music)

41:08.060 --> 41:11.880
- Cancer took my wife
Gertrude four years ago

41:11.880 --> 41:14.300
but that was after she
suffered through two years

41:14.300 --> 41:15.963
of it eatin' up her insides.

41:17.020 --> 41:19.600
Gertrude was a good bit younger than me

41:19.600 --> 41:22.883
and well, we had a
pretty healthy sex life.

41:24.050 --> 41:27.180
But the cancer, it was ovarian cancer.

41:27.180 --> 41:29.423
It just plain put a stop to the sex.

41:30.810 --> 41:32.080
I did okay for awhile

41:32.080 --> 41:35.370
but hell, it gets, it
gets downright lonely

41:35.370 --> 41:37.743
on a farm 20 miles from town.

41:38.770 --> 41:42.910
And well, I get the urge
to wet my wick, you know?

41:42.910 --> 41:44.930
Well, I guess you don't
know 'cause you're a priest

41:44.930 --> 41:49.760
but anyway, what's a perfectly healthy man

41:49.760 --> 41:54.050
with, with perfectly
natural urges supposed to do

41:54.050 --> 41:58.573
when the only living female is, is a goat?

42:01.831 --> 42:02.664
(gentle guitar music)

42:02.664 --> 42:03.497
- Hello again.

42:08.078 --> 42:09.245
What happened?

42:10.440 --> 42:11.903
Wife take a poke at ya?

42:13.324 --> 42:14.673
- Oh, I'm not married.

42:16.527 --> 42:17.410
- You got a lady?

42:21.200 --> 42:22.033
- Yeah.

42:24.440 --> 42:25.857
Thank you, ma'am.

42:25.857 --> 42:27.473
- I'm not anybody's ma'am.

42:28.570 --> 42:33.570
Name's Mary Francis.
(lighter clacking)

42:33.890 --> 42:36.014
Is your brother in?
(moving to somber music)

42:36.014 --> 42:38.643
- Uh, he's in there saving souls.

42:39.560 --> 42:41.793
- I, I tried to deny my feelings for her.

42:42.720 --> 42:45.427
I named her Gertrude
after my wife, you know?

42:45.427 --> 42:48.853
But to be honest, in the dark,

42:50.470 --> 42:51.870
it ain't all that different.

42:53.730 --> 42:55.980
Father, you think God'll
forgive me for this?

43:06.134 --> 43:08.801
(gentle music)

43:14.593 --> 43:16.510
- Well, it's all yours.

43:17.389 --> 43:18.439
Hey, wait one second.

43:21.750 --> 43:24.050
Just don't confess to
stealing anything, okay?

43:25.077 --> 43:26.470
- What?

43:26.470 --> 43:27.653
- Just trust me.

43:40.450 --> 43:44.400
- Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

43:44.400 --> 43:46.930
- How long's it been since
your last confession, child?

43:46.930 --> 43:47.763
- I don't know.

43:49.560 --> 43:51.203
Maybe two years.

43:52.060 --> 43:53.360
- State your sins, please.

43:54.420 --> 43:56.233
- I swear sometimes.

43:58.920 --> 44:00.423
I think about sex a lot.

44:03.290 --> 44:04.837
- How often do you do this?

44:04.837 --> 44:06.210
(tense music)

44:06.210 --> 44:09.023
- Whenever I meet someone I fancy.

44:11.414 --> 44:12.290
(Mary chuckling)

44:12.290 --> 44:13.540
That's a lot of someones.

44:15.150 --> 44:15.983
- I see.

44:16.970 --> 44:18.120
Is there anything else?

44:19.260 --> 44:22.930
- Father, I think what
you're doing here is amazing.

44:22.930 --> 44:25.800
Is there any way I can
be part of your crusade?

44:25.800 --> 44:27.657
- What are you talking about?

44:27.657 --> 44:29.510
- Do you need an assistant?

44:29.510 --> 44:30.893
Someone to help you?

44:32.400 --> 44:33.353
I'm pretty handy.

44:34.520 --> 44:35.880
- Uh, I have my brother

44:35.880 --> 44:38.903
and he's, he's more than adequate.

44:41.040 --> 44:41.873
- Sorry.

44:43.370 --> 44:44.953
I just thought I'd offer.

44:47.767 --> 44:50.434
I feel, I don't know what it is.

44:53.379 --> 44:54.212
A calling.

44:55.430 --> 44:57.180
- I appreciate the offer.

44:57.180 --> 45:00.360
For you sins, three Our
Fathers and three Hail Marys.

45:00.360 --> 45:02.943
(gentle music)

45:11.654 --> 45:12.770
- You want change for this?

45:12.770 --> 45:13.620
- [Mary] Keep it.

45:17.220 --> 45:18.053
- Did you give your brother

45:18.053 --> 45:19.390
the money back?
(tense music)

45:19.390 --> 45:21.950
- No, Father, he doesn't deserve it.

45:21.950 --> 45:24.200
It, it wasn't his money
in the first place.

45:24.200 --> 45:25.810
- Of course it was his money.

45:25.810 --> 45:27.560
What you did was stealing.

45:27.560 --> 45:29.900
You took something that
didn't belong to you!

45:29.900 --> 45:30.920
- I don't know about that, Father.

45:30.920 --> 45:32.512
He didn't...

45:32.512 --> 45:33.471
(door rattling)

45:33.471 --> 45:34.820
- Sinner!

45:34.820 --> 45:36.706
Are you, what are you crazy?

45:36.706 --> 45:37.881
(man grunting)

45:37.881 --> 45:41.746
(eerie electronic music)

45:41.746 --> 45:43.246
- [Michael] Jesus.

45:46.718 --> 45:47.551
- What the hell are you doing?

45:47.551 --> 45:48.466
Get after him!

45:48.466 --> 45:51.216
(dramatic music)

46:25.031 --> 46:26.791
(gun firing)
(man shouting)

46:26.791 --> 46:29.552
(soft tense music)

46:29.552 --> 46:31.314
(kick thudding)
(Mary grunting)

46:31.314 --> 46:34.481
- I knew you boys needed an assistant.

46:36.022 --> 46:38.439
(gun firing)

46:40.695 --> 46:41.695
I cook, too.

46:44.363 --> 46:47.363
(crickets chirping)

46:51.640 --> 46:52.473
(machete thudding)

46:52.473 --> 46:55.347
(hand thudding)

46:55.347 --> 46:59.014
(soft footsteps clattering)

47:01.650 --> 47:03.920
- [Michael] She shouldn't be in here.

47:03.920 --> 47:06.920
- She saved our butts, which
is more than I can say for you.

47:08.500 --> 47:11.690
- Oh, well maybe if you
stopped killing people.

47:11.690 --> 47:13.423
- Don't say something you'll regret.

47:15.000 --> 47:15.833
- Fine.

47:17.370 --> 47:18.203
Excuse me.

47:21.285 --> 47:23.868
(tense music)

47:30.440 --> 47:32.083
- Why the hands, Father?

47:34.060 --> 47:36.260
- The hands of a thief
are offensive to God.

47:39.530 --> 47:43.050
- Doesn't sin start with the head, Father?

47:43.050 --> 47:46.023
- The hands are the tool
of the unrepentant sinner.

47:52.100 --> 47:53.150
I'll hold him steady.

47:56.250 --> 47:58.873
- I hope you won't cut
off my hands, Father.

48:00.360 --> 48:02.063
- Don't give me a reason to.

48:04.928 --> 48:07.660
(machete thudding)
(tense music)

48:07.660 --> 48:08.493
God bless.

48:10.015 --> 48:12.598
(man grunting)

48:15.722 --> 48:18.305
(man groaning)

48:20.882 --> 48:23.465
(man growling)

48:26.083 --> 48:28.666
(man grunting)

48:43.165 --> 48:44.165
Here you go.

48:45.335 --> 48:46.280
(sighs) You can stay here

48:46.280 --> 48:49.327
until we figure something else out.

48:49.327 --> 48:52.140
Uh, it's late so we'll talk tomorrow.

48:54.677 --> 48:56.510
Good night, God bless.

48:59.992 --> 49:01.825
- Good night, Vincent.

49:04.196 --> 49:05.446
Night, Michael.

49:11.324 --> 49:14.824
(moving to ominous music)

50:15.299 --> 50:17.882
(man groaning)

50:22.151 --> 50:24.734
(man growling)

50:27.652 --> 50:30.235
(man grunting)

50:53.086 --> 50:57.003
(moving to tense choral music)

51:09.764 --> 51:13.029
(man shrieking)

51:13.029 --> 51:15.780
(typewriter keys clattering)

51:15.780 --> 51:18.363
(man groaning)

51:35.280 --> 51:36.900
- [Marty] And Pariah is joining us

51:36.900 --> 51:38.963
from Safehaven, Mississippi.

51:39.980 --> 51:42.000
What's up ghoul friend?

51:42.000 --> 51:43.310
I've missed ya.

51:43.310 --> 51:45.163
- Not a lot I can talk about, Marty.

51:46.360 --> 51:49.730
- What, you're not gonna
start holdin' out on me now?

51:49.730 --> 51:51.930
I mean, gimme something to chew on, girl.

51:51.930 --> 51:53.353
I am starvin' here.

51:54.960 --> 51:57.900
- Well, since you put it like that,

51:59.372 --> 52:01.593
I did find religion.

52:01.593 --> 52:04.430
- [Marty] (chuckling) Babe, no, no, no,

52:04.430 --> 52:05.463
say it ain't so!

52:06.300 --> 52:08.053
- It's not what you think, Marty.

52:09.300 --> 52:10.943
It's kind of a kick, actually.

52:11.869 --> 52:14.160
- Really, oh, okay, all right.

52:14.160 --> 52:15.850
I'll give ya the benefit of the doubt.

52:15.850 --> 52:18.900
How did you find religion?

52:18.900 --> 52:20.580
- Perhaps it's more accurate
(tense music)

52:20.580 --> 52:22.713
to say that religion found me.

52:23.883 --> 52:25.717
- (laughing) Oh boy.

52:25.717 --> 52:28.663
You're a bad, bad, bad girl, Pariah.

52:29.580 --> 52:31.747
- I try to be good, Marty,

52:33.021 --> 52:35.854
but being good is just so tedious.

52:39.460 --> 52:43.279
(crickets chirping)

52:43.279 --> 52:46.067
(footsteps thudding softly)

52:46.067 --> 52:48.734
(ominous music)

53:04.406 --> 53:07.156
(lock clacking)

53:42.901 --> 53:46.568
(footsteps thudding softly)

53:51.423 --> 53:53.221
(eerie hissing music)

53:53.221 --> 53:55.804
(tense music)

54:14.297 --> 54:16.241
(loud knocking)

54:16.241 --> 54:18.741
(tense music)

54:29.023 --> 54:30.455
- Hello, Vincent.

54:30.455 --> 54:31.288
Been a long time.

54:31.288 --> 54:32.740
- [Vincent] Hello, Father.

54:32.740 --> 54:33.723
What a surprise.

54:36.660 --> 54:38.207
- You gonna invite me in?

54:41.613 --> 54:44.363
(ominous music)

54:49.178 --> 54:50.793
The old place doesn't look the same.

54:50.793 --> 54:52.493
- [Vincent] None of us do, Father.

54:53.930 --> 54:56.660
- Michael, how are ya, son?

54:56.660 --> 54:58.410
- Hangin' in there, Father?

54:58.410 --> 54:59.493
I missed you.

54:59.493 --> 55:01.210
- Missed you both.

55:01.210 --> 55:02.160
It's been too long.

55:04.750 --> 55:07.130
- So, Father, what do you want?

55:07.130 --> 55:09.780
I know you didn't come all
this way just to chitchat.

55:11.090 --> 55:13.730
- All right then, I'll
come straight to the point.

55:13.730 --> 55:16.843
The Archbishop is unhappy
with your activities up here.

55:18.160 --> 55:20.650
He knows what you're up to, Vincent.

55:20.650 --> 55:23.130
He's prepared to take action if necessary

55:23.130 --> 55:24.850
to stop you from claiming

55:24.850 --> 55:27.460
to be associated with the church.

55:27.460 --> 55:29.120
- Is that so?

55:29.120 --> 55:30.070
- I'm afraid it is.

55:31.920 --> 55:33.283
I came here to warn you.

55:34.280 --> 55:35.320
- You're warning me?

55:35.320 --> 55:36.770
- You're damn right, Vincent.

55:36.770 --> 55:38.920
You've been excommunicated
from the church.

55:39.900 --> 55:41.780
You wouldn't follow the rules then,

55:41.780 --> 55:43.780
you're not following them now.

55:43.780 --> 55:46.270
- To hell with your church's rules.

55:46.270 --> 55:49.250
I have my own church now, my own rules.

55:49.250 --> 55:51.510
- That's fine, Vincent, that's fine,

55:51.510 --> 55:53.310
but you can't call it Catholic

55:53.310 --> 55:55.310
and you can't take confession.

55:55.310 --> 55:58.470
- I could do whatever the
hell I damn well please.

55:58.470 --> 56:01.430
This was still America
the last time I looked.

56:01.430 --> 56:03.880
- Perhaps you should look again.

56:03.880 --> 56:06.310
I'm sorry to hear that's your position.

56:06.310 --> 56:08.640
I hope you'll reconsider.

56:08.640 --> 56:10.740
Take a week and think about it.

56:10.740 --> 56:12.720
I won't say anything to the archdiocese

56:12.720 --> 56:13.967
till I hear from you.

56:17.480 --> 56:18.593
Here's my number.

56:21.974 --> 56:25.350
(eerie music)

56:25.350 --> 56:29.448
I'm sorry, young lady, we
haven't been introduced.

56:29.448 --> 56:32.070
- I'm Mary Francis.

56:32.070 --> 56:33.860
- Good to meet you, Mary.

56:33.860 --> 56:35.723
Are you a member of Vincent's church?

56:39.100 --> 56:40.750
- Thanks for stopping by, Father.

56:45.440 --> 56:47.360
- Look, Vincent, I apologize

56:47.360 --> 56:51.180
if my dropping in unannounced
like this has upset you.

56:51.180 --> 56:52.550
That wasn't my intention

56:52.550 --> 56:55.630
but I needed to talk to
you about a couple things.

56:55.630 --> 56:57.420
- Well, I'm not stopping my ministry.

56:57.420 --> 56:59.840
What else do you wanna talk about?

56:59.840 --> 57:02.773
- Do you remember Sam Oldfield
and his daughter, Kimberly?

57:03.800 --> 57:06.010
- Yeah, they were parishioners
of mine for 10 years.

57:06.010 --> 57:07.356
Kimberly was a teenager then

57:07.356 --> 57:09.500
and I helped her with some issues.

57:09.500 --> 57:11.450
She's still struggling with those issues

57:11.450 --> 57:13.620
and came to see me recently.

57:13.620 --> 57:16.230
She talked about you and how
you helped her back then,

57:16.230 --> 57:19.498
and how comfortable she
felt in talking to you.

57:19.498 --> 57:22.657
She said she wanted to
find you and speak to you.

57:22.657 --> 57:24.907
- Well, she never found me.

57:26.127 --> 57:27.700
- I see.

57:27.700 --> 57:29.800
Unfortunately, Kimberly's missing now,

57:29.800 --> 57:33.278
and Sam and his wife were
murdered two weeks ago.

57:33.278 --> 57:36.063
(gun firing)

57:36.063 --> 57:39.063
(dishes shattering)

57:40.770 --> 57:42.520
- Oh, well, oh my God.

57:45.064 --> 57:45.897
(eerie music)

57:45.897 --> 57:49.950
I, I'm really sorry to hear that.

57:49.950 --> 57:52.400
- Yeah, we all were.

57:52.400 --> 57:54.880
Sam was one of the good guys.

57:54.880 --> 57:55.713
- Yeah.

57:58.160 --> 58:01.243
- All right, then, good
to see you two boys again.

58:02.147 --> 58:04.730
(man growling)

58:05.980 --> 58:07.930
What's going on, Vincent?

58:07.930 --> 58:09.849
You got some kind of animal back there?

58:09.849 --> 58:11.800
(man growling)

58:11.800 --> 58:12.900
- Something like that.

58:14.620 --> 58:17.063
- Think about what we discussed, Vincent.

58:18.033 --> 58:18.866
Call me.

58:22.554 --> 58:25.221
- [Michael] Father
Taylor's right, Vincent.

58:25.221 --> 58:26.135
He was a good guy.

58:26.135 --> 58:28.740
(ominous music)

58:28.740 --> 58:30.550
- Say what, Michael?

58:30.550 --> 58:34.130
- It was wrong, I told you it was wrong.

58:34.130 --> 58:35.313
You shouldn't have killed them.

58:35.313 --> 58:37.060
They were good people.

58:37.060 --> 58:38.010
You shouldn't have killed anybody.

58:38.010 --> 58:39.150
You're not God.

58:39.150 --> 58:40.309
- Shut up, Michael.

58:40.309 --> 58:42.720
(moving to dramatic electronic music)

58:42.720 --> 58:44.870
- What are you saying, Michael?

58:44.870 --> 58:45.777
That Vincent...

58:45.777 --> 58:48.194
(gun firing)

58:53.170 --> 58:55.360
- I had no choice, Vincent.

58:55.360 --> 58:58.550
I should shoot you too, you fucking Judas.

58:58.550 --> 58:59.383
- Save it.

59:00.270 --> 59:01.220
We have work to do.

59:03.248 --> 59:05.485
What are you doing?

59:05.485 --> 59:07.985
(eerie music)

59:13.776 --> 59:16.943
(Father Joe coughing)

59:22.408 --> 59:26.290
- Vincent, Vincent, you can't do this.

59:26.290 --> 59:27.792
He didn't even do anything, man.

59:27.792 --> 59:28.625
(shouting)

59:28.625 --> 59:29.458
Jesus!

59:31.000 --> 59:31.913
He's still alive.

59:32.836 --> 59:33.669
(gun firing)

59:33.669 --> 59:34.774
God, what?

59:34.774 --> 59:36.464
- Problem solved.

59:36.464 --> 59:38.445
- What the fuck is wrong with you?

59:38.445 --> 59:42.940
(door clattering)
(Vincent grunting)

59:42.940 --> 59:43.773
- No.

59:45.588 --> 59:46.940
- Ah, damn it.

59:46.940 --> 59:49.270
- You, you cannot do this.

59:51.794 --> 59:52.627
Fuck.

59:54.218 --> 59:56.885
(body thudding)

01:00:01.803 --> 01:00:06.803
(door banging)
(Vincent panting)

01:00:07.014 --> 01:00:09.681
(ominous music)

01:00:20.130 --> 01:00:23.880
(motorcycle engine rumbling)

01:00:54.260 --> 01:00:56.422
(phone ringing)

01:00:56.422 --> 01:00:59.089
(somber music)

01:01:02.870 --> 01:01:04.280
- [Ruby] Hey, you called Ruby

01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:07.984
but I can't answer so leave a message.

01:01:07.984 --> 01:01:10.984
(voicemail beeping)

01:01:36.399 --> 01:01:39.113
(crickets chirping)

01:01:39.113 --> 01:01:41.863
(light knocking)

01:01:51.722 --> 01:01:54.385
- (sighing) Are you all right?

01:01:54.385 --> 01:01:55.980
(tense music)

01:01:55.980 --> 01:01:57.570
- With what?

01:01:57.570 --> 01:02:00.360
Murdering the guy that saved
our lives when we were kids?

01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:02.003
- He left us no choice.

01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:04.740
- Us?

01:02:04.740 --> 01:02:07.190
So she's making your moral decisions now?

01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:08.323
- What do you expect?

01:02:09.690 --> 01:02:11.023
You betrayed us both.

01:02:11.900 --> 01:02:14.470
You realize we're all in
this together, don't you?

01:02:14.470 --> 01:02:16.663
One of us slips, we all go down.

01:02:17.970 --> 01:02:19.280
- I don't care anymore.

01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:20.750
- Well, you should.

01:02:20.750 --> 01:02:23.303
- Whatever your earthly objectives are,

01:02:24.890 --> 01:02:27.343
what we're doing here
is God's work, brother.

01:02:28.470 --> 01:02:29.563
It's our mission.

01:02:31.100 --> 01:02:32.630
- It's your mission.

01:02:32.630 --> 01:02:34.110
I'm just here to clean up your mess.

01:02:34.110 --> 01:02:36.410
- Oh, you lack faith.

01:02:36.410 --> 01:02:38.830
That's why you're losing focus.

01:02:38.830 --> 01:02:41.363
Look, I could have done
none of this without you.

01:02:42.730 --> 01:02:43.900
We're a team.

01:02:43.900 --> 01:02:47.004
God will reward us both.

01:02:47.004 --> 01:02:49.360
(Michael laughing)

01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:51.560
- You really believe that, don't you?

01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:52.503
- He told me so.

01:02:54.700 --> 01:02:56.600
- I wonder why I didn't get that call?

01:03:00.910 --> 01:03:03.443
- Well, after tonight's
shenanigans, brother,

01:03:04.930 --> 01:03:06.880
I need to know that you can be trusted.

01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:12.450
- I'm not the one you need
to worry about, brother.

01:03:14.088 --> 01:03:17.088
(crickets chirping)

01:03:21.830 --> 01:03:23.490
- Did you speak to him?

01:03:25.096 --> 01:03:26.179
- We're good.

01:03:27.653 --> 01:03:28.833
- I hope you're right.

01:03:33.475 --> 01:03:36.058
Hey, wanna take a walk, Father?

01:03:39.903 --> 01:03:42.169
I have something to confess.

01:03:42.169 --> 01:03:44.836
(ominous music)

01:03:48.562 --> 01:03:51.312
(fire crackling)

01:04:05.919 --> 01:04:08.919
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

01:04:25.373 --> 01:04:28.790
(belt buckle clattering)

01:04:30.555 --> 01:04:33.388
(Vincent moaning)

01:04:49.041 --> 01:04:53.208
(moving to dramatic choral music)

01:05:42.405 --> 01:05:45.322
(Vincent groaning)

01:05:57.649 --> 01:05:59.066
Tell me, Vincent,

01:06:00.311 --> 01:06:04.736
what the hell have you got
in that cellar of yours?

01:06:04.736 --> 01:06:07.877
Whatever it is, I wanna meet it.

01:06:07.877 --> 01:06:10.877
(crickets chirping)

01:06:13.713 --> 01:06:16.163
Hey, where the hell is your brother?

01:06:18.030 --> 01:06:21.363
(ominous choral music)

01:06:37.829 --> 01:06:42.829
(door clacking)
(doorbell ringing)

01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:44.450
- What are you doing here?
(people chattering)

01:06:44.450 --> 01:06:45.400
- I should ask you

01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:46.780
the same thing.
(Ruby sighing)

01:06:46.780 --> 01:06:48.230
- None of your business.

01:06:48.230 --> 01:06:49.600
- You are my business.

01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:51.030
Let's go.

01:06:51.030 --> 01:06:52.803
- No, I'm busy.

01:06:55.308 --> 01:06:56.210
- I'll wait outside.

01:06:56.210 --> 01:06:57.043
- Good.

01:06:57.043 --> 01:06:58.227
What are you?

01:06:58.227 --> 01:07:00.288
Are you serious?

01:07:00.288 --> 01:07:01.383
I'm, I'm sorry.

01:07:01.383 --> 01:07:03.560
(doorbell ringing)

01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:04.393
- Are you okay?

01:07:06.020 --> 01:07:06.853
- Oh, yeah.

01:07:09.502 --> 01:07:12.085
(somber music)

01:07:14.410 --> 01:07:16.400
Where's Mary Francis?

01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:17.750
Didn't she give you a ride?

01:07:18.950 --> 01:07:20.877
She went to see a friend.

01:07:20.877 --> 01:07:22.433
- (chuckling) She has friends?

01:07:29.630 --> 01:07:33.610
You know, I've been thinking

01:07:35.770 --> 01:07:37.593
maybe you don't need me anymore.

01:07:38.760 --> 01:07:40.120
- You're my brother.

01:07:40.120 --> 01:07:41.170
I'll always need you.

01:07:42.810 --> 01:07:44.320
- For what?

01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:47.300
To drive, to cook, tend the garden,

01:07:47.300 --> 01:07:49.100
chop people up?

01:07:49.100 --> 01:07:50.100
She can do all that.

01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:54.680
- We're family.

01:07:54.680 --> 01:07:55.980
We need to stick together.

01:07:57.420 --> 01:07:59.350
- Yeah, we'll always be family.

01:07:59.350 --> 01:08:04.267
But I don't think I can do this anymore.

01:08:11.281 --> 01:08:14.614
(moving to tense music)

01:08:25.580 --> 01:08:26.412
Things change.

01:08:27.350 --> 01:08:28.607
You have someone now.

01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:32.060
Why can't I have someone, too?

01:08:43.100 --> 01:08:46.684
(moving to dramatic music)

01:09:08.340 --> 01:09:09.173
(Mary grunting)

01:09:09.173 --> 01:09:11.268
(Ruby gasping)

01:09:11.268 --> 01:09:13.999
(Ruby coughing)

01:09:13.999 --> 01:09:16.749
(Mary grunting)

01:09:23.470 --> 01:09:27.470
I found a woman, Vincent,
a really decent woman.

01:09:29.010 --> 01:09:29.843
- Good for you.

01:09:31.089 --> 01:09:34.421
(dramatic choral music)

01:09:36.620 --> 01:09:37.924
- Somebody I can be happy with,

01:09:37.924 --> 01:09:39.774
somebody I can start a new life with.

01:09:52.785 --> 01:09:54.972
(knife slashing)

01:09:54.972 --> 01:09:57.639
(Mary grunting)

01:10:09.463 --> 01:10:10.337
I love her.

01:11:03.198 --> 01:11:05.928
- Rest in peace, bitch.

01:11:05.928 --> 01:11:07.714
Or whatever the hell they say.

01:11:07.714 --> 01:11:10.381
(somber music)

01:11:14.337 --> 01:11:16.723
- You're not happy for me, are you?

01:11:18.203 --> 01:11:21.143
- I want for you what the
Lord wants for you, brother.

01:11:22.910 --> 01:11:23.810
Isn't that enough?

01:11:27.908 --> 01:11:30.908
(crickets chirping)

01:11:33.980 --> 01:11:36.813
(door clattering)

01:12:00.448 --> 01:12:03.740
(phone ringing)

01:12:03.740 --> 01:12:05.400
- [Ruby] Hey, you called Ruby

01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:08.932
but I can't answer so leave a message.

01:12:08.932 --> 01:12:11.932
(voicemail beeping)

01:12:21.380 --> 01:12:23.190
- [Vincent] Do you realize
just how close we are

01:12:23.190 --> 01:12:24.833
to making Dad's dream come true?

01:12:25.980 --> 01:12:27.830
We've recovered almost all the money.

01:12:29.710 --> 01:12:30.543
- Great.

01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:33.810
He can spend the rest of his
life chained to a palm tree

01:12:33.810 --> 01:12:35.679
on a desert island.

01:12:35.679 --> 01:12:38.960
- (scoff) But you're still
gonna leave us, aren't you?

01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:41.043
You're gonna leave us
with your girlfriend?

01:12:44.060 --> 01:12:45.593
You're not taking any of this.

01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:48.740
- I don't want it.

01:12:49.870 --> 01:12:51.262
Keep it.

01:12:51.262 --> 01:12:52.963
- Well, what do you want, Michael?

01:12:54.490 --> 01:12:57.233
- Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

01:12:58.410 --> 01:13:00.178
- [Vincent] You sure you
wanna do this, brother?

01:13:00.178 --> 01:13:02.000
(tense music)

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:02.833
- Please.

01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:06.503
- How long's it been since
your last confession?

01:13:06.503 --> 01:13:07.713
- I don't remember.

01:13:08.980 --> 01:13:09.813
Too long.

01:13:11.930 --> 01:13:13.480
- Then state your sins, please.

01:13:14.470 --> 01:13:17.470
- I've spent most of my life
letting terrible things happen.

01:13:19.210 --> 01:13:20.070
I was weak.

01:13:20.070 --> 01:13:22.113
(somber music)

01:13:22.113 --> 01:13:23.390
I was wrong.

01:13:23.390 --> 01:13:25.510
- State your sins, please.

01:13:25.510 --> 01:13:26.383
- I just did.

01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:29.420
- These aren't sins.

01:13:29.420 --> 01:13:31.120
You're no different than most men.

01:13:33.270 --> 01:13:35.070
We all have regrets.

01:13:35.070 --> 01:13:38.070
- I was complicit in heinous acts.

01:13:38.070 --> 01:13:38.903
In murder.

01:13:40.220 --> 01:13:42.370
- State your sins, please.

01:13:42.370 --> 01:13:43.780
- Murder, many murders,

01:13:43.780 --> 01:13:46.420
I did nothing to stop them, any of 'em.

01:13:46.420 --> 01:13:49.020
I kept my father in a hole,
feeding him pieces of...

01:13:52.390 --> 01:13:53.653
I want forgiveness.

01:13:54.780 --> 01:13:57.150
- No forgiveness is required, brother,

01:13:57.150 --> 01:13:59.610
when you haven't committed a sin!

01:13:59.610 --> 01:14:00.520
- Vincent?

01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:02.255
- Go in peace.

01:14:02.255 --> 01:14:03.310
- Not until you've--

01:14:03.310 --> 01:14:04.360
- [Vincent] Go in peace, brother.

01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:05.471
- Not until you've

01:14:05.471 --> 01:14:09.006
acknowledged my sins!
- Go in fucking peace!

01:14:09.006 --> 01:14:11.506
- You can't even give me that.

01:14:12.576 --> 01:14:15.123
(crickets chirping)

01:14:15.123 --> 01:14:18.873
(motorcycle engine rumbling)

01:14:23.764 --> 01:14:26.264
(tense music)

01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:41.273
Where were you?

01:14:43.110 --> 01:14:44.910
- I had some things to take care of.

01:14:45.820 --> 01:14:46.743
- What things?

01:14:48.330 --> 01:14:50.280
- Michael's got some news for us, Mary.

01:14:51.930 --> 01:14:54.943
Seems he's moving on to greener pastures.

01:14:55.821 --> 01:14:57.238
Isn't that right?

01:15:00.896 --> 01:15:03.479
- Congratulations and all that.

01:15:07.199 --> 01:15:08.449
- Going to bed.

01:15:15.691 --> 01:15:16.524
- Well?

01:15:16.524 --> 01:15:19.107
(somber music)

01:15:32.539 --> 01:15:35.289
(ominous music)

01:15:40.930 --> 01:15:43.180
- She's just about all
I think about, Father.

01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:47.513
In the morning, in the afternoon.

01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:52.473
When I'm snoring next to my wife at night.

01:15:53.880 --> 01:15:54.790
She doesn't know it

01:15:54.790 --> 01:15:58.383
but my head's full of pretty
little pictures of Clara.

01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:00.900
- Well, you need to stop.

01:16:00.900 --> 01:16:03.250
Lusting after the wife
of another man is a sin.

01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:05.450
- But I love her, Father.

01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:08.540
And as sure as tomorrow
is a brand new day,

01:16:08.540 --> 01:16:09.933
I love her like crazy.

01:16:19.474 --> 01:16:22.224
(ominous music)

01:16:25.084 --> 01:16:27.751
(Mary coughing)

01:16:35.033 --> 01:16:37.700
(Mary coughing)

01:17:02.339 --> 01:17:03.450
- What are you doing?

01:17:03.450 --> 01:17:04.890
Why are you stopping?

01:17:04.890 --> 01:17:05.723
- I have to take care of something.

01:17:05.723 --> 01:17:07.350
I'll be right back.

01:17:07.350 --> 01:17:08.370
- Mary Francis is sick.

01:17:08.370 --> 01:17:10.044
We need to get her home.

01:17:10.044 --> 01:17:11.640
- I said I'll be right back.

01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:12.905
- Please, Michael.

01:17:12.905 --> 01:17:15.180
(coughing)

01:17:15.180 --> 01:17:16.013
- Sorry.

01:17:18.889 --> 01:17:22.056
(solemn choral music)

01:17:38.007 --> 01:17:40.410
- You didn't have to do it.

01:17:40.410 --> 01:17:41.743
- Relax, Vincent.

01:17:43.660 --> 01:17:44.493
Be cool.

01:17:49.434 --> 01:17:54.434
(thunder rumbling)
(rain pattering)

01:18:14.359 --> 01:18:17.359
(thunder cracking)

01:18:31.287 --> 01:18:34.454
(somber choral music)

01:18:43.191 --> 01:18:44.115
- Michael?

01:18:44.115 --> 01:18:45.807
(thunder rumbling)

01:18:45.807 --> 01:18:47.187
Michael?

01:18:47.187 --> 01:18:48.223
What's wrong?

01:18:49.860 --> 01:18:50.693
What happened?

01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:53.953
Talk to me.

01:18:55.300 --> 01:18:56.133
- She's gone.

01:18:58.720 --> 01:18:59.753
- Gone, gone where?

01:19:02.070 --> 01:19:02.903
- She's dead.

01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:05.909
Murdered.

01:19:05.909 --> 01:19:07.581
(thunder rumbling)

01:19:07.581 --> 01:19:10.248
(ominous music)

01:19:14.313 --> 01:19:16.050
(light knocking)

01:19:16.050 --> 01:19:16.883
What?

01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:23.700
Thought you were sick.

01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:25.713
- I am.

01:19:26.619 --> 01:19:28.869
(coughing)

01:19:31.560 --> 01:19:33.183
I just wanted to make sure

01:19:34.249 --> 01:19:35.666
that you're okay.

01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:38.180
- I'm fucking awesome.

01:19:39.410 --> 01:19:40.243
You happy?

01:19:41.550 --> 01:19:44.853
- All right, I'm sorry about your friend.

01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:47.193
- Hey,

01:19:51.640 --> 01:19:54.140
where'd you really get to last night?

01:19:54.140 --> 01:19:56.048
- I had a few problems to take care of.

01:19:56.048 --> 01:19:58.965
(thunder rumbling)

01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:15.010
- Well?

01:20:15.010 --> 01:20:17.070
- Where'd you tell him I was last night?

01:20:17.070 --> 01:20:18.800
- Seeing some friends.

01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:19.633
- That was dumb.

01:20:21.315 --> 01:20:23.565
(coughing)

01:20:24.738 --> 01:20:26.260
- Well, I'm sorry.

01:20:26.260 --> 01:20:29.140
Now look, you should take my bed tonight.

01:20:29.140 --> 01:20:29.973
- Thanks.

01:20:31.410 --> 01:20:34.219
If you don't mind, I'm
gonna sit tomorrow out.

01:20:34.219 --> 01:20:35.219
I need rest.

01:20:36.384 --> 01:20:37.384
- Of course.

01:20:41.148 --> 01:20:43.565
- [Mary] Good night, Vincent.

01:20:46.284 --> 01:20:48.784
(tense music)

01:20:51.083 --> 01:20:54.083
(crickets chirping)

01:21:08.155 --> 01:21:10.905
(latch clicking)

01:21:37.723 --> 01:21:40.390
(ominous music)

01:21:51.792 --> 01:21:54.375
(eerie music)

01:22:02.012 --> 01:22:02.845
- Michael?

01:22:06.565 --> 01:22:07.398
Michael?

01:22:35.664 --> 01:22:38.331
(lock clacking)

01:22:41.073 --> 01:22:43.740
(boot thudding)

01:22:45.177 --> 01:22:47.927
(ominous music)

01:22:51.325 --> 01:22:54.658
(sledgehammer thudding)

01:22:59.663 --> 01:23:02.330
(wood cracking)

01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:06.250
- I told you she couldn't be trusted.

01:23:10.087 --> 01:23:12.217
I've never hurt anybody in my whole life

01:23:13.876 --> 01:23:16.700
but I can't let her live.

01:23:16.700 --> 01:23:18.100
Not after what's she's done.

01:23:21.049 --> 01:23:24.065
(sledgehammer clacking)

01:23:24.065 --> 01:23:26.815
(chain jangling)

01:23:35.769 --> 01:23:38.436
(Mary grunting)

01:23:42.325 --> 01:23:45.658
(sledgehammer thudding)

01:23:56.977 --> 01:23:57.810
It's okay.

01:23:58.965 --> 01:24:01.195
(Alvin groaning)
It's okay.

01:24:01.195 --> 01:24:03.695
(eerie music)

01:24:25.089 --> 01:24:30.089
(hammer clacking)
(Mary grunting)

01:24:40.520 --> 01:24:42.000
Well, well, well.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:43.570
What do we have here?

01:24:43.570 --> 01:24:46.084
You definitely don't disappoint, Pariah.

01:24:46.084 --> 01:24:46.917
(gun firing)

01:24:46.917 --> 01:24:47.750
(Mary grunting)

01:24:47.750 --> 01:24:50.583
(dramatic music)

01:24:52.257 --> 01:24:54.009
You took her from me, didn't you?

01:24:54.009 --> 01:24:58.057
- (laughing) Ah, it was
a joy watching her die.

01:24:59.079 --> 01:25:00.640
(laughing)

01:25:00.640 --> 01:25:01.473
Better than sex.

01:25:03.327 --> 01:25:04.160
(gun firing)

01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:05.780
Ouch!

01:25:05.780 --> 01:25:06.613
Vincent?

01:25:07.771 --> 01:25:09.497
(Mary screaming)
(Michael screaming)

01:25:09.497 --> 01:25:10.695
- Get off of me!

01:25:10.695 --> 01:25:12.027
(Michael grunting)

01:25:12.027 --> 01:25:13.695
(gun firing)

01:25:13.695 --> 01:25:15.100
(Mary grunting)

01:25:15.100 --> 01:25:17.363
I've got someone who's
been dying to meet you.

01:25:18.660 --> 01:25:22.530
- I hope there's room down
there for your brother, asshole.

01:25:22.530 --> 01:25:24.287
He gave me the green light.

01:25:24.287 --> 01:25:27.240
(Michael grunting)
(Mary groaning)

01:25:27.240 --> 01:25:28.620
- That's a lie.

01:25:28.620 --> 01:25:30.250
- Ask him.

01:25:30.250 --> 01:25:32.800
Your little girlfriend
meant nothing to me.

01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:34.680
He didn't want her coming
between the two of you.

01:25:34.680 --> 01:25:35.910
He knew you were leaving.

01:25:35.910 --> 01:25:37.820
He couldn't live with that.

01:25:37.820 --> 01:25:40.005
- Your lies aren't gonna save you.

01:25:40.005 --> 01:25:43.930
- (laughing) Why the fuck
would I wanna be saved?

01:25:43.930 --> 01:25:46.650
Spend eternity with hypocrites?

01:25:46.650 --> 01:25:47.910
No, thanks.

01:25:47.910 --> 01:25:49.266
I know what I am.

01:25:49.266 --> 01:25:50.963
- I don't give a fuck what you are.

01:25:52.942 --> 01:25:54.790
(Mary yelping)

01:25:54.790 --> 01:25:57.270
(door creaking)
(Michael grunting)

01:25:57.270 --> 01:25:59.941
Go on, get in there.

01:25:59.941 --> 01:26:00.817
(Mary grunting)

01:26:00.817 --> 01:26:02.023
But I should tell you,

01:26:03.020 --> 01:26:05.117
my dad's not too fond of thieves either.

01:26:05.957 --> 01:26:08.900
- It's never been too popular.

01:26:08.900 --> 01:26:10.306
(giggling)

01:26:10.306 --> 01:26:13.055
(Michael panting)

01:26:13.055 --> 01:26:14.650
Fuck!

01:26:14.650 --> 01:26:16.315
(body thudding)

01:26:16.315 --> 01:26:17.163
(door banging)

01:26:17.163 --> 01:26:19.830
(ominous music)

01:26:28.134 --> 01:26:30.801
(Mary grunting)

01:26:35.374 --> 01:26:38.124
(Alvin groaning)

01:26:48.122 --> 01:26:49.442
Don't be afraid.

01:26:49.442 --> 01:26:52.192
(Alvin groaning)

01:26:58.690 --> 01:27:01.440
You don't scare me, Elephant Man.

01:27:03.413 --> 01:27:06.080
(Mary grunting)

01:27:10.130 --> 01:27:13.602
And I've fucked much uglier than you.

01:27:13.602 --> 01:27:18.602
(knife slicing)
(Mary screaming)

01:27:19.223 --> 01:27:21.698
(Alvin growling)

01:27:21.698 --> 01:27:24.166
(knife slicing)
(Mary screaming)

01:27:24.166 --> 01:27:26.916
(Alvin growling)

01:27:29.898 --> 01:27:32.582
(Mary screaming)

01:27:32.582 --> 01:27:35.249
(Mary coughing)

01:27:40.021 --> 01:27:42.771
(Alvin growling)

01:27:53.321 --> 01:27:54.154
(knife thudding)

01:27:54.154 --> 01:27:56.904
(Mary screaming)

01:28:03.201 --> 01:28:05.868
(ominous music)

01:28:13.013 --> 01:28:13.846
- Michael.

01:28:36.381 --> 01:28:38.881
(eerie music)

01:28:45.378 --> 01:28:48.461
(eerie choral music)

01:28:53.034 --> 01:28:55.451
(gun firing)

01:29:04.639 --> 01:29:07.306
(somber music)

01:29:13.935 --> 01:29:14.768
Michael.

01:29:20.371 --> 01:29:21.204
Mary.

01:29:30.407 --> 01:29:31.656
(door creaking)

01:29:31.656 --> 01:29:33.567
(moving to tense music)

01:29:33.567 --> 01:29:34.400
Michael.

01:29:46.682 --> 01:29:47.515
Micheal.

01:29:50.882 --> 01:29:52.247
Oh, my God, Mary.

01:29:52.247 --> 01:29:55.414
(somber choral music)

01:29:58.129 --> 01:29:59.737
Dad, why Dad, why?

01:29:59.737 --> 01:30:00.608
(prod zapping)
(Alvin groaning)

01:30:00.608 --> 01:30:02.327
Get in there.

01:30:02.327 --> 01:30:03.160
Why Mary?

01:30:06.867 --> 01:30:09.903
- Well that was a fine
Christian gesture, Vincent.

01:30:12.450 --> 01:30:15.123
Thank God we didn't keep
him in that hospital,

01:30:15.123 --> 01:30:17.743
where they would have, how'd you put it,

01:30:18.600 --> 01:30:21.750
surely abused him and
treated him like garbage.

01:30:21.750 --> 01:30:23.630
- Sorry, brother.

01:30:23.630 --> 01:30:24.503
I lost my head.

01:30:25.750 --> 01:30:29.235
- No, you didn't, but your girlfriend did.

01:30:29.235 --> 01:30:31.170
(eerie music)

01:30:31.170 --> 01:30:32.970
- What happened here?

01:30:32.970 --> 01:30:34.270
Why this?

01:30:34.270 --> 01:30:35.183
- She was a thief.

01:30:36.400 --> 01:30:38.763
She was fixin' to run
off with all Dad's money.

01:30:39.830 --> 01:30:42.400
This is how we treat thieves, remember?

01:30:42.400 --> 01:30:43.233
- No.

01:30:44.800 --> 01:30:46.920
She wasn't like them.

01:30:46.920 --> 01:30:49.020
- On the contrary, she was just like them.

01:30:50.110 --> 01:30:52.070
Only worse.
(Alvin groaning)

01:30:52.070 --> 01:30:55.550
She was a liar, a cheat, and a manipulator

01:30:55.550 --> 01:30:57.112
just like you.

01:30:57.112 --> 01:30:58.323
- What?
(somber music)

01:30:58.323 --> 01:30:59.190
- The two of you woulda made

01:30:59.190 --> 01:31:01.870
the cutest little couple of hypocrites.

01:31:01.870 --> 01:31:04.060
- What are you talking about?

01:31:04.060 --> 01:31:05.060
- I suspected it

01:31:07.310 --> 01:31:08.753
but I didn't wanna believe it.

01:31:10.460 --> 01:31:12.160
- Believe what, Michael?

01:31:12.160 --> 01:31:13.560
- She meant the world to me.

01:31:15.270 --> 01:31:18.853
She was all I ever cared about
and you took her from me.

01:31:20.140 --> 01:31:21.690
- Please, Michael, all right?

01:31:21.690 --> 01:31:23.183
- Don't!

01:31:23.183 --> 01:31:25.020
(Alvin groaning)

01:31:25.020 --> 01:31:27.340
You two murdered her.

01:31:27.340 --> 01:31:28.770
- Michael.

01:31:28.770 --> 01:31:29.663
- Stop it.

01:31:31.555 --> 01:31:33.623
- All right, look,
you're right about Mary.

01:31:35.740 --> 01:31:37.200
She admitted it.

01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:38.800
- Ruby didn't mean shit to Mary.

01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:41.740
She killed her with your blessing.

01:31:41.740 --> 01:31:43.313
- No, Michael that...

01:31:43.313 --> 01:31:44.240
(Alvin groaning)

01:31:44.240 --> 01:31:47.283
- [Michael] Stop lying and
maybe I'll forgive you.

01:31:48.645 --> 01:31:49.623
- I'm sorry, brother.

01:31:50.481 --> 01:31:52.513
I, I sinned.

01:31:52.513 --> 01:31:54.040
(moving to dramatic music)

01:31:54.040 --> 01:31:56.873
I, I allowed myself to
be seduced by Satan.

01:31:58.610 --> 01:31:59.471
I was weak.

01:31:59.471 --> 01:32:02.221
(Alvin growling)

01:32:03.630 --> 01:32:05.784
Please forgive me, brother.

01:32:05.784 --> 01:32:08.534
(Alvin groaning)

01:32:14.920 --> 01:32:15.837
I was weak.

01:32:18.900 --> 01:32:22.169
Please, please forgive me, brother.

01:32:22.169 --> 01:32:23.502
- I forgive you.

01:32:24.750 --> 01:32:27.167
- Thank, thank you, brother.

01:32:30.109 --> 01:32:31.550
- May death be your salvation.

01:32:31.550 --> 01:32:32.383
(gun clacking)

01:32:32.383 --> 01:32:33.216
- Michael, no, no!

01:32:33.216 --> 01:32:36.372
(gun firing)
(Vincent shouting)

01:32:36.372 --> 01:32:39.122
(Alvin groaning)

01:32:47.103 --> 01:32:48.750
- And mine as well.

01:32:48.750 --> 01:32:50.918
(Alvin groaning)

01:32:50.918 --> 01:32:53.501
(gun clicking)

01:32:58.502 --> 01:33:01.252
(Alvin grunting)

01:33:04.862 --> 01:33:08.053
(somber music)

01:33:08.053 --> 01:33:09.025
(gentle choral music)
(Alvin groaning)

01:33:09.025 --> 01:33:11.775
(Michael crying)

01:33:21.403 --> 01:33:24.153
(fire crackling)

01:33:37.141 --> 01:33:39.724
(somber music)

01:34:01.821 --> 01:34:03.532
(church bell ringing)

01:34:03.532 --> 01:34:06.532
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

01:34:31.857 --> 01:34:35.024
(somber choral music)

01:34:37.451 --> 01:34:39.393
(typewriter keys clattering)

01:34:39.393 --> 01:34:44.010
- [Marty] This is Beyond
Midnight on WMGO, River Radio.

01:34:44.010 --> 01:34:46.700
Alan is joining us from Baxterville.

01:34:46.700 --> 01:34:47.730
How ya keepin', brother?

01:34:47.730 --> 01:34:50.300
- [Alan] Oh, I'm keepin'
pretty good, Marty.

01:34:50.300 --> 01:34:51.690
You know me.

01:34:51.690 --> 01:34:56.243
I was curious, though,
whatever happened to Pariah?

01:34:57.330 --> 01:34:59.490
I miss that crazy broad.

01:34:59.490 --> 01:35:00.713
She was a trip.

01:35:01.580 --> 01:35:03.520
- [Marty] Uh, we all miss her, Al.

01:35:03.520 --> 01:35:06.290
It's been a couple of months
since she last blessed us

01:35:06.290 --> 01:35:07.560
with that sweet madness

01:35:08.571 --> 01:35:10.993
but I'm sure we haven't
heard the last of her.

01:35:10.993 --> 01:35:13.460
- [Alan] Yo, man, didn't
she say like one time

01:35:13.460 --> 01:35:15.890
she escaped from some
loony bin in New York?

01:35:15.890 --> 01:35:19.490
Oh, Marty, man, Piranha
was crazy as hell, man.

01:35:19.490 --> 01:35:22.600
She came up with the craziest
story every time she called.

01:35:22.600 --> 01:35:25.220
- [Woman] That girl had
some issues that's for sure

01:35:26.660 --> 01:35:28.240
but it would always make my night

01:35:28.240 --> 01:35:31.570
whenever she would make up
another of her crazy stories

01:35:31.570 --> 01:35:34.803
about how she had killed
this fellow and that fellow.

01:35:35.990 --> 01:35:38.260
And she was hard to take at times

01:35:39.450 --> 01:35:42.740
but she would make me laugh

01:35:42.740 --> 01:35:46.410
so hard my sides would ache.

01:35:46.410 --> 01:35:49.350
- [Marty] I'm not so sure
she did make them stories up

01:35:49.350 --> 01:35:51.393
but she was always so damn convincing.

01:35:52.650 --> 01:35:55.820
If you're listening,
babe, wherever ya are,

01:35:55.820 --> 01:35:59.410
I love ya, and I know
you're still raising hell.

01:36:26.917 --> 01:36:30.500
(moving to dramatic music)

01:38:03.704 --> 01:38:06.371
(somber music)

01:38:16.918 --> 01:38:17.751
(typewriter bell ringing)

01:38:17.751 --> 01:38:19.942
(roller clacking)

01:38:19.942 --> 01:38:22.609
(book thudding)
