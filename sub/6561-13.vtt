09:58.465 --> 10:01.034
- WE'RE HAVING AN ELECTRICAL
PROBLEM WITH THE PLUMBING,

10:01.101 --> 10:02.670
AND IT WILL BE FIXED TODAY.

10:03.904 --> 10:04.872
- IT'S A GHOST.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.206
[all talking at once]

10:06.273 --> 10:07.474
- NO, NO, NO, NO,
NO, NO, NO, NO.

10:07.540 --> 10:10.711
THERE IS NO GHOST.

10:10.778 --> 10:13.981
BUT I WILL BE OFFERING
A FREE IN-ROOM MOVIE

10:14.047 --> 10:14.948
FOR ANY INCONVENIENCE.

10:15.015 --> 10:16.917
[all muttering]

10:21.955 --> 10:22.856
both: NEW GIRL.

10:22.923 --> 10:24.224
NICE.

10:24.291 --> 10:25.726
- WHAT IS TAKING SO LONG?

10:25.793 --> 10:27.260
WE HAVE TO CATCH THAT GHOST.

10:27.327 --> 10:30.964
- GHOST HUNTING
TAKES PATIENCE AND POISE.

10:31.031 --> 10:32.065
SO DON'T PRESSURE ME!

10:35.035 --> 10:38.205
- IT'S 2:03 AND THERE ARE
NO SUCH THING AS GHOSTS,

10:38.271 --> 10:39.807
AND CARLOS IS STILL STUPID.

10:39.873 --> 10:41.775
- GET OUT OF HERE.

10:41.842 --> 10:42.910
OKAY.

10:42.976 --> 10:45.245
NOW WE JUST PRESS RECORD

10:45.312 --> 10:48.716
AND LOOK FOR ANYTHING UNUSUAL.

10:51.418 --> 10:53.153
whoosh!

10:53.220 --> 10:54.221
[screams]

10:54.287 --> 10:55.823
[all screaming]

10:55.889 --> 10:57.390
- A GHOST!

10:57.457 --> 11:00.260
- OH, I CAN SEE WHY YOU GUYS
LOVE THAT POOL,

11:00.327 --> 11:02.462
BUT I'M SURPRISED YOU DON'T
HAVE MORE FRIENDS.

11:02.529 --> 11:04.431
- YEAH, THEY ALL WASHED AWAY.

11:04.497 --> 11:06.499
- SO, WHAT'S FOR DINNER?

11:06.566 --> 11:09.369
I SAY FISH STICK SATURDAY.

11:09.436 --> 11:10.838
FISH STICK SATURDAY!

11:10.904 --> 11:12.305
- [shouting]
DON'T...

11:12.372 --> 11:13.373
[softer]
YOU THINK...

11:13.440 --> 11:15.743
YOUR MANSION IS UNFLOODED
BY NOW?

11:15.776 --> 11:19.813
- YEAH, YOU DON'T WANT TO SLEEP
ON THAT UGLY COUCH AGAIN.

11:19.880 --> 11:22.750
YOU NEED TO BE
IN YOUR OWN COMFY BED.

11:22.750 --> 11:26.286
- YEAH, DON'T YOU MISS
THE COMFORTS OF YOUR HOME

11:26.353 --> 11:28.421
AND NOT OURS?

11:28.488 --> 11:30.257
- YOU KNOW WHAT.

11:30.323 --> 11:32.893
YOU DAWGS ARE RIGHT.

11:32.960 --> 11:34.427
I MISS MY THINGS.

11:37.998 --> 11:38.899
- THANKS AGAIN, FELLAS.

11:38.966 --> 11:41.201
WOO-HOO!

11:41.268 --> 11:43.536
- YOU ASKED
IF HE MISSED HIS BED?

11:43.603 --> 11:46.173
- THIS IS NOT WHAT WE MEANT.

11:46.239 --> 11:47.507
- PILLOW FIGHT!

11:47.574 --> 11:50.443
[laughing]

11:51.678 --> 11:53.680
OH, OH, AH!
WHOA!

11:53.781 --> 11:54.782
boom!

11:58.786 --> 12:00.888
- OH, AND REMEMBER
WHEN I BUMPED INTO KENDALL

12:00.954 --> 12:02.122
AND I SPILLED MY OATMEAL?

12:02.189 --> 12:03.690
[laughs]

12:03.791 --> 12:06.093
- YEAH, 'CAUSE IT HAPPENED,
LIKE, TWO MINUTES AGO.

12:06.159 --> 12:07.394
- GOOD TIMES, MAN.

12:07.460 --> 12:08.428
GOOD TIMES.

12:08.495 --> 12:10.831
splat!

12:12.900 --> 12:14.301
- THIS IS BETTER
THAN PAY-PER-VIEW.

12:14.367 --> 12:17.070
- SO TELL ME,
IS YOUR MANSION UNFLOODED NOW?

12:17.137 --> 12:18.271
- FUNNY YOU SHOULD ASK.

12:18.338 --> 12:20.540
I JUST GOT A CALL FROM THE CREW,

12:20.607 --> 12:22.709
AND THEY SAID IT'S GONNA
TAKE ANOTHER DAY...

12:22.810 --> 12:24.177
OR FIVE.

12:24.244 --> 12:25.078
- [shouting]
WHAT?

12:25.145 --> 12:26.346
- JAMES!

12:26.413 --> 12:27.915
DID YOU SEE THING OUT
IN THE HALLWAY?

12:27.981 --> 12:28.949
COME ON.

12:29.016 --> 12:31.284
- HE SNORES ALL NIGHT,

12:31.351 --> 12:33.053
SCARES SUNBLOCK GIRL AWAY,

12:33.120 --> 12:35.322
AND, OATMEAL FACE?

12:35.388 --> 12:37.557
WHICH IS ACTUALLY GOOD
FOR MY COMPLEXION.

12:37.624 --> 12:41.194
BUT I CAN'T TAKE FIVE MORE DAYS!

12:41.261 --> 12:43.196
- SNAP OUT OF IT.

12:43.263 --> 12:45.999
IT'S TIME WE TAKE THE BULL
BY THE HORNS

12:46.066 --> 12:48.135
AND HANDLE THIS LIKE MEN.

12:49.469 --> 12:52.505
[both shouting at once]

12:52.572 --> 12:54.507
- WHAT IS GUSTAVO
STILL DOING HERE?

12:54.574 --> 12:56.509
HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE
IN HIS MANSION ALONE,

12:56.576 --> 12:57.577
WRITING A NEW SONG.

12:57.644 --> 12:59.146
- YEAH, HE FLOODED HIS MANSION.

12:59.212 --> 13:00.447
- I KNOW THAT.

13:00.513 --> 13:02.215
AND NOW IT'S UNFLOODED.

13:02.282 --> 13:04.317
I TOLD HIM LAST NIGHT
THAT HE COULD GO BACK.

13:04.384 --> 13:05.418
- WAIT.

13:05.485 --> 13:07.587
HE JUST TOLD US
IT WASN'T READY.

13:07.654 --> 13:09.857
- PLEASE TELL ME HE'S NOT
RUNNING AROUND,

13:09.890 --> 13:11.558
HAVING FUN, AND PLAYING.

13:11.624 --> 13:13.861
- TAG AND SEEK!

13:13.861 --> 13:16.930
KELLY'S IT!

13:16.997 --> 13:18.165
- WHAT IS TAG AND SEEK?

13:19.867 --> 13:21.234
- YOU GUYS NEED TO UNDERSTAND

13:21.301 --> 13:23.203
THAT GUSTAVO DIDN'T PLAY GAMES
WITH KIDS GROWING UP.

13:23.270 --> 13:24.905
HIS MOM MADE HIM PRACTICE PIANO
ALL DAY.

13:24.972 --> 13:26.173
- REALLY?

13:26.239 --> 13:27.174
SEE, NOW I FEEL KIND OF BAD.

13:27.240 --> 13:28.141
- WELL, DON'T.

13:28.208 --> 13:29.376
[together] RIGHT.

13:29.442 --> 13:30.978
- HE NEEDS TO GET
BACK TO THE MANSION

13:31.044 --> 13:32.880
AND WRITE SONGS FOR THE ALBUM,
OR THERE WILL BE NO ALBUM.

13:32.913 --> 13:34.081
- GOT IT.
WHAT DO WE DO?

13:34.147 --> 13:35.315
- HERE'S THE PLAN.

13:35.382 --> 13:37.517
NUMBER ONE, I'M GONNA GO
BACK TO THE STUDIO.

13:37.584 --> 13:39.619
TWO, YOU GUYS GET GUSTAVO
BACK TO THE MANSION

13:39.686 --> 13:40.753
AND MAKE SURE HE WRITES A SONG

13:40.888 --> 13:42.389
AND SOLVE EVERYTHING.

13:42.455 --> 13:43.390
- RIGHT.

13:43.456 --> 13:44.524
WAIT, WHAT?

13:44.591 --> 13:45.893
- MARCO POLO!

13:45.959 --> 13:47.060
- OH!

13:47.127 --> 13:49.196
- NO HIT BACKS!

13:49.262 --> 13:51.631
- WHAT GAME IS HE PLAYING?

13:55.068 --> 13:57.104
HEY, WE NEED HELP GETTING
GUSTAVO BACK TO HIS MANSION.

13:57.170 --> 13:59.372
- YEAH, WELL, WE NEED HELP
GETTING RID OF A GHOST.

13:59.439 --> 14:00.573
- THERE IS NO GHOST.

14:00.640 --> 14:02.675
THERE IS NO GHOST.

14:02.742 --> 14:03.810
- YES, THERE IS.

14:03.911 --> 14:06.213
AND THIS PLACE
IS FREAKING ME OUT.

14:08.515 --> 14:10.918
[together] NEW GIRL.
NICE.

14:10.951 --> 14:11.919
[growls]

14:14.254 --> 14:16.423
- WE HAVE TO GET RID
OF THAT GHOST.

14:16.489 --> 14:17.357
- DON'T WORRY.

14:17.424 --> 14:19.292
WE'LL CATCH IT...

14:19.359 --> 14:20.527
TONIGHT.

14:20.593 --> 14:22.295
- WITH A FISHING NET?

14:22.362 --> 14:23.796
- AN ECTO-NET.

14:23.931 --> 14:24.932
- FISHING NET.

14:24.932 --> 14:26.499
- AN ECTO-NET.
- FISHING NET.

14:26.566 --> 14:27.667
- ECTO-NET!
- IT'S A FISHING NET.

14:27.734 --> 14:29.069
- ECTO-NET!

14:29.136 --> 14:30.938
- OH, LET'S GO FISHING
WITH THE FISHING NET.

14:33.173 --> 14:34.942
- GUSTAVO.

14:34.942 --> 14:36.944
HEY, WE KNOW YOU NEED SOME
NEW SONGS FOR THE ALBUM.

14:37.010 --> 14:38.946
- SO HOW ABOUT THIS ONE?

14:38.979 --> 14:41.949
[together] * PLEASE DON'T STAY
ANOTHER MOMENT *

14:42.015 --> 14:44.651
* WE DON'T WANT TO HEAR
MORE WORDS SPOKEN *

14:44.717 --> 14:45.618
* WALK ON THROUGH THE DOOR *

14:45.685 --> 14:47.187
OH, LOOK.
IT'S OPEN!

14:47.254 --> 14:48.555
* AND YOU SNORE IN THE DARK *

14:48.621 --> 14:50.423
* AND IT'S FREAKING US OUT *

14:52.259 --> 14:54.461
- BAD, RIGHT?
- TERRIBLE.

14:54.527 --> 14:56.596
YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU SHOULD
PROBABLY GO BACK TO THE MANSION

14:56.663 --> 14:57.597
AND WRITE A NEW SONG.

14:57.664 --> 14:59.666
- A BETTER SONG FOR THE ALBUM.

15:02.002 --> 15:03.971
- NO, LET'S GO WITH YOURS.

15:05.973 --> 15:07.540
I'M SKIING DOWN THE ALPS.

15:09.376 --> 15:12.279
- OKAY, IT'S DAY TWO.

15:12.345 --> 15:14.014
10:53 P.M.

15:14.081 --> 15:16.316
ME, BITTERS, AND LOGAN
ARE GONNA SLEEP IN THE LOBBY

15:16.383 --> 15:19.619
IN HOPES TO CATCH THE GHOST.

15:19.686 --> 15:22.855
- THERE ARE NO GHOSTS.

15:22.990 --> 15:24.992
fart!

15:24.992 --> 15:27.394
- DUDE.

15:27.460 --> 15:29.362
- DID YOU HEAR THAT?

15:29.429 --> 15:32.365
IT WAS THE GHOST.

15:32.432 --> 15:34.001
- BITTERS JUST RIPPED ONE.

15:37.704 --> 15:40.640
[intense snoring]

15:43.576 --> 15:45.512
- WE ROLL GUSTAVO ONTO
THE STRETCHER.

15:45.578 --> 15:47.880
- ROLL HIM BACK TO HIS MANSION
AND IN FRONT OF HIS PIANO.

15:48.015 --> 15:50.117
- THEN HE WRITES A SONG,
AND WE GET OUR CRIB BACK.

15:50.183 --> 15:53.086
[both whispering at once]

15:55.088 --> 15:56.023
- GOT HIS LEGS?
GOT HIS LEGS?

15:56.056 --> 15:57.024
- TOO FAR.

15:57.057 --> 15:58.058
LOSE HIM.
LOSE HIM.

15:58.125 --> 15:59.026
GOING DOWN!
GOING DOWN!

15:59.026 --> 16:00.360

16:00.427 --> 16:01.928
boom!

16:06.333 --> 16:07.734
slam!

16:07.800 --> 16:10.470
- WHAT WAS THAT?

16:10.537 --> 16:12.539
[all screaming]

16:12.605 --> 16:14.174
[thunderclap]

16:14.241 --> 16:17.410

16:17.477 --> 16:20.047
[all screaming]

16:20.047 --> 16:21.581

16:25.418 --> 16:27.587
[both screaming]

16:28.888 --> 16:30.257
[screaming intensifies]

16:30.323 --> 16:32.292
- OH, IT'S JUST US!

16:33.626 --> 16:35.728
AND GUSTAVO,
WHO'S STILL HERE!

16:35.795 --> 16:37.397
- * AND YOU SNORE IN THE DARK *

16:37.464 --> 16:39.632
* AND IT'S FREAKING'S US OUT *

16:39.699 --> 16:41.301
- COME ON!

16:41.368 --> 16:43.070
- WHOA!
- GO, GO, GO, GO.

16:43.070 --> 16:46.073
- BOYS?

16:46.073 --> 16:48.108
- I CANNOT BELIEVE WE CAN'T
GET RID OF GUSTAVO.

16:48.175 --> 16:51.178
- YEAH, WELL, I CAN'T BELIEVE
WE CAN'T GET RID OF A GHOST.

16:51.244 --> 16:52.779
both: YOU BELIEVE IN GHOSTS?

16:52.845 --> 16:55.115
- I BELIEVE IN THE DOO-DOOS
IN MY PANTS.

16:56.216 --> 17:00.720
- GHOST!

17:00.787 --> 17:02.655
- WE HAVEN'T FAILED THIS BAD

17:02.722 --> 17:04.891
SINCE WE LOST TO DULUTH EAST
IN HOCKEY 8-1.

17:04.957 --> 17:06.359
- RIGHT.

17:06.426 --> 17:08.295
THAT WAS THE GAME THAT
KENDALL AND I GOT EJECTED FROM

17:08.361 --> 17:09.796
FOR UNSPORTSMANLIKE MOONING.

17:11.098 --> 17:11.998
- WAIT A MINUTE.

17:12.099 --> 17:13.166
THAT'S IT.

17:13.233 --> 17:15.602
- WE SHOULD MOON GUSTAVO
AND THE GHOST?

17:15.668 --> 17:16.869
- NO.

17:16.936 --> 17:18.838
WE BEAT DULUTH EAST
LATER IN THE FINALS

17:18.905 --> 17:21.908
BECAUSE WE WERE ALL BACK
ON THE ICE TOGETHER.

17:21.974 --> 17:24.010
[together] AS A TEAM.

17:24.111 --> 17:25.112
- RIGHT!

17:25.112 --> 17:26.546
WE'RE GONNA TEAM MOON THEM.

17:26.613 --> 17:27.614
- ALMOST.

17:27.680 --> 17:29.782
WE'RE GONNA TEAM UP.

17:37.790 --> 17:39.459
- VACUUM CLEANERS.

17:39.526 --> 17:41.928
WE'RE GONNA TRAP A GHOST
WITH VACUUM CLEANERS.

17:41.994 --> 17:43.163
- NO.

17:43.230 --> 17:45.465
ECTO-VACUUM CLEANERS.

17:45.532 --> 17:48.535
- THEY TRAP DUST MITES,
STALE ODORS, AND GHOSTS.

17:50.403 --> 17:51.938
- SO HOW COME I DON'T
GET A VACUUM?

17:52.004 --> 17:54.374
- OH, YOU'RE THE GHOST BAIT.

17:54.441 --> 17:55.408
- OH, RIGHT.

17:55.475 --> 17:56.343
W-W-W-W-WHAT?

17:57.410 --> 17:59.146
W-W-WHAT?

18:01.948 --> 18:04.851
SO ARE WE GONNA BE TAKING TURNS

18:04.917 --> 18:06.353
GUYS?

18:06.419 --> 18:08.155
GUYS?

18:08.155 --> 18:09.156
OKAY, I'M ALONE AND SCARED.

18:09.222 --> 18:11.291
I WOULD REALLY LIKE SOME--

18:11.358 --> 18:12.525

18:12.592 --> 18:14.194

18:15.495 --> 18:17.164

FREAKY GHOST.

18:17.230 --> 18:20.867
- ECTO-VACUUMS.

18:20.933 --> 18:21.868
GET IT!

18:21.934 --> 18:23.503

GRAFFITI WALLS *

18:25.338 --> 18:27.340
* BILLBOARDS LIGHTING UP
THE BLOCK *

18:27.407 --> 18:30.410
* EVERYONE ONE OF US
ON A MISSION *

18:30.477 --> 18:32.312
* BECAUSE THE NIGHT IS YOUNG *

18:32.379 --> 18:34.281
* THE LINE IS OUT THE DOOR *

18:34.347 --> 18:35.782
* TODAY WAS CRAZY *

18:35.848 --> 18:38.017
* BUT TONIGHT THE CITY'S OURS *

18:38.084 --> 18:39.085

- * LIVE IT UP *

18:40.253 --> 18:42.189
* UNTIL THE MORNING COMES *

18:42.189 --> 18:43.456
* TODAY WAS CRAZY *

18:43.523 --> 18:44.691
* BUT TONIGHT *

18:44.757 --> 18:46.193
[thunderclap]

18:46.259 --> 18:47.894
- BLAST IT!

18:47.960 --> 18:50.830
[all screaming]

18:54.501 --> 18:56.236
all: THE NEW GIRL?

18:56.303 --> 18:58.104
- YOU WERE THE GHOST?

18:58.205 --> 19:00.507
