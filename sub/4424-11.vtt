Kyle, when have I ever ripped
on you for being a Jew?

01:39.141 --> 01:40.684
Oh, yeah?
Well, you're a stupid Jew.

I don't want to go to your
faggy birthday party anyway!

to Casa Bonita.

02:23.477 --> 02:24.937

just now.

02:25.062 --> 02:26.939

you said some things,

but I think it was good
and we've moved past it.

02:29.066 --> 02:30.985

02:56.594 --> 02:58.888

03:14.153 --> 03:16.363
God damn it.
I have to get invited to go!

03:16.488 --> 03:18.991
I'm just gonna have to start
being nice to Kyle.

03:22.411 --> 03:24.371
Hi, Kyle.

03:25.331 --> 03:26.415
That isn't it, Cartman.

03:26.540 --> 03:27.833
What isn't it?

03:27.958 --> 03:29.168
That's not being nice.

03:29.293 --> 03:31.712
That's just putting on
a nice sweater.

03:32.338 --> 03:34.548
I don't understand
the difference.

03:34.673 --> 03:36.300
I know you don't.

03:40.304 --> 03:42.348
Jimmy!
Hey, Jimmy, wait up!

03:42.473 --> 03:44.058
Dude, I need your advice
on something.

03:44.183 --> 03:45.059
Well, sure, Eric.

03:45.184 --> 03:47.186
W-What seems to be
the p-problem?

03:47.311 --> 03:48.520
Well, everybody likes you,
Jimmy,

03:48.646 --> 03:50.147
and you seem to be really good
with people.

03:50.272 --> 03:51.899
So I was wondering
if you could tell me --

03:52.024 --> 03:53.317
How do you act nice to people?

03:53.442 --> 03:55.444
Well, the best thing is
not to <i>act</i> nice, Eric.

03:55.569 --> 03:57.780
The best thing is to be
genuinely nice.

03:57.905 --> 04:00.032
Okay. So how do you act
genuinely nice to people?

04:00.157 --> 04:01.367
Well, Eric, p-part of being nice

04:01.492 --> 04:03.035
is just making people smile
and laugh.

04:03.160 --> 04:05.829
The best way to do that
is by telling a f-fantastic joke

04:05.955 --> 04:08.624
or a humorous anecd--
anecdo-o-o...

04:08.749 --> 04:09.792
anecdote.

04:09.917 --> 04:10.834
Like what?

04:10.960 --> 04:12.503
Well, like try this one on
for size.

04:12.628 --> 04:14.505
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?

04:14.630 --> 04:17.174
Ingmar Bergman.

04:18.842 --> 04:21.387
Now you say,
"Ingmar Bergman who?"

04:22.346 --> 04:23.889
Take that, Jimmy!
And that!

04:24.014 --> 04:26.225
And don't you <i>ever</i> talk bad
about Kyle again!

04:26.350 --> 04:27.434
Kyle is my friend!

04:27.559 --> 04:29.561
And if you say you had sex
with his mom one more time,

04:29.687 --> 04:30.854
I'm gonna really let you
have it!

04:30.980 --> 04:32.022
You hear me?!

04:32.147 --> 04:34.692
Oh. Kyle.
Hey.

04:36.068 --> 04:39.113
You really think that beating up
a handicapped kid is being nice?

04:41.031 --> 04:43.242
Uh...h-hey, Kyle.

04:43.367 --> 04:44.368
Knock, knock.

04:44.493 --> 04:45.995
Knock, knock, Kyle.

04:54.461 --> 04:56.297
Yeah, Casa Bonita this Saturday.

04:56.422 --> 04:57.965
Wow!
That's gonna be so fun!

04:58.090 --> 04:59.967
Yeah, it'll be awesome.
Just the four of us.

05:00.092 --> 05:01.218
Mrph!

05:08.309 --> 05:09.184
Hey, Kyle.

05:09.310 --> 05:10.269
- Well?
- Well, what?

05:10.394 --> 05:11.645
How are you going to try
to get invited

05:11.770 --> 05:13.731
- to Casa Bonita this time?
- I'm not, Kyle.

05:13.856 --> 05:15.566
I know you already told Butters
he could go.

05:15.691 --> 05:17.985
Oh. Well, yeah.
I-I did.

05:18.110 --> 05:18.902
So fine, Kyle.

05:19.028 --> 05:20.904
But honestly,
I never meant to make you feel

05:21.030 --> 05:22.448
like you didn't matter
at all to me.

05:22.573 --> 05:24.783
I know we argue all the time
and I give you tons of crap,

05:24.908 --> 05:26.994
but we've also been through
a lot together.

05:27.119 --> 05:29.455
And maybe that alone
doesn't make us friends,

05:29.580 --> 05:31.123
but it makes us something.

05:31.248 --> 05:32.624
So whatever, you know?

05:32.750 --> 05:35.544
Just --
I hope things can be cool.

05:38.672 --> 05:40.549
I'm still not inviting you
to Casa Bonita.

05:40.674 --> 05:42.760
I know, Kyle.
I'll see you later.

05:44.678 --> 05:46.680
H-Hey, Cartman.

05:47.639 --> 05:49.391
You really don't care
that you can't go?

05:49.516 --> 05:51.477
I care, sure,
but I hope it doesn't mean

05:51.602 --> 05:53.896
you and me and Stan and Kenny
can't hang out anymore.

05:54.021 --> 05:56.398
That's exactly what I wanted
to hear from you all along.

05:56.523 --> 05:57.733
I-I still have to take Butters,

05:57.858 --> 05:59.651
but I hope things can be cool,
too.

05:59.777 --> 06:00.611
Good.

06:00.736 --> 06:03.322
And hey, if for some reason
Butters can't go to Casa Bonita,

06:03.447 --> 06:04.615
you can take his place.

06:04.740 --> 06:05.741
Sweet.
Whatever.

06:07.159 --> 06:08.744
Bingo.

06:10.621 --> 06:12.081
What's this all about, Eric?

06:12.206 --> 06:13.499
Butters, can you keep a secret?

06:13.624 --> 06:14.833
Well, sure, I can.

06:14.958 --> 06:16.919
For the past five days,
I've been looking out into space

06:17.044 --> 06:18.170
for a school project.

06:18.295 --> 06:19.671
This morning at 3:45 a.m.,

06:19.797 --> 06:21.757
I caught first sight
of something terrible.

06:21.882 --> 06:23.092
How terrible?

06:23.217 --> 06:24.510
A meteor.

06:24.635 --> 06:26.887
A meteor the size of Wyoming --
heading right for Earth.

06:27.012 --> 06:28.764
- What?!
- Now, look, I could be wrong.

06:28.889 --> 06:30.015
I pray that I'm wrong.

06:30.140 --> 06:33.018
But I just want you to take
a look and see what you think.

06:35.270 --> 06:37.356
- Do you see anything?
- I just see stars.

06:37.481 --> 06:38.482
Keep looking.

06:38.607 --> 06:40.651
Sometimes it takes your eyes
a minute to adjust.

06:40.776 --> 06:41.777
Nope.
I don't see any --

06:41.902 --> 06:44.696
Whoa! Wait! Oh, my God!
I see it! I see it!

06:44.822 --> 06:46.532
It's a meteor!
Oh, my God!

06:46.657 --> 06:47.533
Oh, my God!

06:47.658 --> 06:49.618
Does it look like
it's getting closer?

06:50.828 --> 06:53.288
It is!
It is getting closer!

06:53.414 --> 06:54.623
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

06:54.748 --> 06:56.125
That meteor is the size
of Wyoming,

06:56.250 --> 06:57.626
and it's on a collision course
for Earth.

06:57.751 --> 06:59.044
When do you think
it'll get here?

06:59.169 --> 07:00.212
I-I don't know.

07:00.337 --> 07:01.880
I'd have to do
some calculations.

07:02.005 --> 07:07.886
10 to the power of 1 base 9
divided by pi plus 5 minus 3.

07:08.011 --> 07:09.596
- Oh, Jesus.
- What?

07:09.721 --> 07:10.931
According to my calculations,

07:11.056 --> 07:12.850
that meteor's gonna hit Earth
in less than four hours.

07:12.975 --> 07:14.935
- You mean we're gonna die?!
- No! No, Butters!

07:15.060 --> 07:15.936
We are going to live!

07:16.061 --> 07:17.604
Do you hear me?
We are going to live!

07:17.729 --> 07:19.606
We've just -- We've got to find
a bomb shelter.

07:19.731 --> 07:21.567
W-Where is there a bomb shelter?

07:21.692 --> 07:22.609
Stan's Uncle Jimbo.

07:22.734 --> 07:24.069
He has a bomb shelter
in his backyard.

07:24.194 --> 07:26.071
- Come on, Butters. Hurry!
- Aah!

07:27.281 --> 07:29.241
Here we go!
The bomb shelter's down here!

07:29.366 --> 07:30.951
Oh, God!
Oh, Jesus!

07:32.494 --> 07:34.163
All right.
We should be safe in here.

07:34.288 --> 07:36.457
There's dried food and water
to last us for weeks.

07:36.582 --> 07:37.624
But what about everyone else?

07:37.749 --> 07:39.460
I have to tell my parents
so they can come here, too!

07:39.585 --> 07:41.086
No! Butters!
I can't let you risk it.

07:41.211 --> 07:43.297
- I'll go up and get the others.
- Are you sure?

07:43.422 --> 07:46.049
I'm not sure of anything
anymore.

07:48.510 --> 07:49.386
Now, Butters, listen.

07:49.511 --> 07:50.554
No matter what happens,

07:50.679 --> 07:53.140
no matter what you hear,
do not come out.

07:53.265 --> 07:54.975
If I don't make it back in time
with the others,

07:55.100 --> 07:56.894
then it will be up to you
to repopulate the earth.

07:57.019 --> 07:58.228
But I'm the only one down here.

07:58.353 --> 08:00.022
What am I supposed to
repopulate with?

08:00.147 --> 08:02.941
Well, you know,
with your wiener.

08:03.734 --> 08:05.861
Just stay down here
until you hear word from me.

08:05.986 --> 08:07.654
And pray, Butters.

08:07.779 --> 08:09.364
Pray for all mankind.

08:12.117 --> 08:15.454
Oh, God. Oh, God.

08:17.247 --> 08:18.248
Where is Butters?

08:18.373 --> 08:19.791
We were supposed to leave
40 minutes ago.

08:19.917 --> 08:21.793
Well, I think we better just go
without him, Kyle.

08:21.919 --> 08:22.794
It's getting late.

08:22.920 --> 08:24.213
Yeah. Screw him.
Let's go.

08:24.338 --> 08:26.423
Oh, finally.

08:28.091 --> 08:29.301
Happy birthday, Kyle.

08:29.426 --> 08:31.094
I just wanted to stop by
and give you your present.

08:31.220 --> 08:32.763
Oh.
Thanks, dude.

08:32.888 --> 08:35.224
Hope you have a good one.
See you later.

08:35.349 --> 08:36.767
Oh, wait.
Cartman.

08:36.892 --> 08:38.435
Yes?

08:38.560 --> 08:39.603
Butters didn't show.

08:39.728 --> 08:41.188
You want to go to Casa Bonita
with us?

08:41.313 --> 08:43.690
Butters didn't show?
I can't believe it.

08:43.815 --> 08:45.692
Are you sure you told him
the right time and everything?

08:45.817 --> 08:47.653
I told him 5:30,
and we got to get going. You in?

08:47.778 --> 08:49.863
Well, I really would need to
go home first and get my --

08:49.988 --> 08:52.449
N-No, I guess I have everything
I need. Okay. Sure.

08:52.574 --> 08:53.617
All right.
Let's go.

08:53.742 --> 08:55.118
Okay, boys.
Get in the car.

08:55.244 --> 08:57.079
Casa Bonita, here we come.

08:57.204 --> 08:59.206
- ♪ Casa Boni-ta, Casa Boni-ta ♪
- Oh, hello, Chris, Linda.

08:59.331 --> 09:03.043
Hello, everyone.
H-Have any of you seen our son?

09:03.919 --> 09:06.088
Butters was supposed to go
with us to Casa Bonita tonight.

09:06.213 --> 09:09.800
We know. But he...hasn't
been home since last night.

09:09.925 --> 09:11.802
The police have been
looking everywhere, but --

09:12.970 --> 09:14.179
Well, thank you.

09:14.304 --> 09:16.974
Uh, please let us know
if you find out anything.

09:17.099 --> 09:20.811
Oh, Butters!

09:20.936 --> 09:22.145
Oh, dude, weak.

09:22.271 --> 09:24.064
Yeah.
Man, that sucks about Butters.

09:24.189 --> 09:25.357
Well, let's get going, shall we?

09:25.482 --> 09:26.608
Nah.

09:26.733 --> 09:29.152
I-I can't go to have a birthday
party while Butters is missing.

09:29.278 --> 09:30.362
Yeah.
It's kind of weird.

09:30.487 --> 09:32.781
Yeah, yeah.
I-I think you're right.

09:32.906 --> 09:35.617
But on the other hand, I think
Butters would want us to go.

09:35.742 --> 09:36.952
You know Butters.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.787
No. I can't.
We should help look for him.

09:38.912 --> 09:41.290
- Yeah.
- That's very good of you, boys.

09:41.415 --> 09:43.792
We can postpone Casa Bonita
until next Saturday.

09:43.917 --> 09:44.793
Next Saturday?!

09:44.918 --> 09:47.379
I'll never be able to keep
Butters down in the...

09:47.504 --> 09:49.756
in the depths of my heart
for that long.

09:49.881 --> 09:51.425
I sure hope he turns up
before then.

09:51.550 --> 09:53.844
We should check Stark's Pond.
Butters always hangs out there.

09:53.969 --> 09:55.596
Yeah, and then we can try
the football field.

09:55.721 --> 09:57.556
I'll drive you boys.

09:58.515 --> 09:59.975
Oh, God damn it!

10:00.100 --> 10:01.768
How am I gonna keep Butters
down in that bomb shelter

10:01.893 --> 10:03.395
for a whole week?!

10:07.316 --> 10:08.525
All right, folks.

10:08.650 --> 10:10.694
This is the little boy
we're looking for --

10:10.819 --> 10:13.864
Leopold Stotch,
also known as Butters.

10:13.989 --> 10:16.992
He's been missing for two days
and was last seen at the school.

10:17.117 --> 10:19.453
Let's go find him.

10:23.123 --> 10:24.875
"Dried food rations.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.044
Add water
to beef-flavored square."

10:27.169 --> 10:29.504
Hello?

10:29.630 --> 10:30.631
Hello?

10:32.257 --> 10:33.258
Butters!

10:33.383 --> 10:34.301
Aah!

10:34.426 --> 10:35.218
Butters!

10:35.344 --> 10:37.054
Oh, God.
It was -- it was horrible.

10:37.179 --> 10:38.555
W-What happened?

10:38.680 --> 10:41.183
The meteor struck the earth
sooner than I predicted.

10:41.308 --> 10:42.851
There was no time.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.144
No time.

10:44.269 --> 10:46.313
What about my parents?
Did you see them?

10:46.438 --> 10:48.148
There was mass confusion,
p-panic.

10:48.273 --> 10:50.150
People were crawling all over
each other in the streets.

10:50.275 --> 10:51.985
It was awful.
Then it hit.

10:52.110 --> 10:53.820
Millions were evaporated
instantly.

10:53.945 --> 10:57.157
The rest of us...walking around
in a cloud of toxic radiation.

10:58.784 --> 10:59.951
Oh, my God.
Let me see!

11:00.077 --> 11:02.537
No, Butters! If you come up,
you'll get infected, too.

11:02.663 --> 11:04.706
You best wait for
the radiation levels to go down.

11:04.831 --> 11:06.917
Probably...next week sometime.

11:07.042 --> 11:08.585
After Saturday.

11:08.710 --> 11:11.129
How many survivors are there?
You should all come down here!

11:11.254 --> 11:13.924
We can't come down there or else
we'll contaminate you, Butters.

11:14.049 --> 11:16.927
No. We just have to survive
the best we can.

11:17.719 --> 11:19.012
Wow.

11:19.137 --> 11:21.181
Eric, I can never thank you
enough

11:21.306 --> 11:22.849
for everything you've done
for me.

11:22.974 --> 11:24.518
Thank me by living, Butters.

11:24.643 --> 11:27.187
Live and...rebuild.

11:27.312 --> 11:29.272
I've got to go.

11:29.398 --> 11:32.275
Remember -- wait one week
for the toxic levels to go down.

11:32.401 --> 11:33.276
After Saturday.

11:33.402 --> 11:34.778
G-Goodbye.

11:37.114 --> 11:38.907
All right.
Just six days, Butters.

11:39.032 --> 11:40.075
Sit tight.

11:40.951 --> 11:42.911
Tom, it has now been three days

11:43.036 --> 11:45.080
since the Stotch child
has gone missing.

11:45.205 --> 11:48.125
Townspeople continue to search,
but hope is dwindling.

11:48.250 --> 11:51.128
All right, folks. I want to
thank you for all your efforts.

11:51.253 --> 11:52.337
Three days is a long time,

11:52.462 --> 11:55.132
but we've got to keep going
if we're gonna find him.

11:55.257 --> 11:57.134
You're not going to find him.

11:57.259 --> 12:00.470
Not until after Saturday, when I
finally go to Casa Bonita.

12:06.768 --> 12:09.980
Many times in cases like these,
a child can trap themselves.

12:10.105 --> 12:11.648
It's important
that we spread our search

12:11.773 --> 12:14.609
to duct pipes, wells,
and bomb shelters.

12:16.737 --> 12:18.405
W-Whoa. What?

12:18.530 --> 12:19.906
I say we need to move the search

12:20.031 --> 12:21.825
to ducts, wells,
and bomb shelters.

12:21.950 --> 12:23.910
Let's move out, people.
Every second counts.

12:25.954 --> 12:27.539
Aah!

12:28.290 --> 12:30.167
♪ But if you leave me now ♪

12:30.292 --> 12:33.128
♪ You take away the biggest part
of me ♪

12:33.253 --> 12:34.796
♪ Ooh, girl ♪

12:34.921 --> 12:37.048
♪ Baby, please don't go ♪

12:37.174 --> 12:38.884
♪ Ooh, girl -- ♪

12:39.009 --> 12:41.094
Eric?

12:41.219 --> 12:42.137
Eric, is that you?

12:42.262 --> 12:44.890
Oh, God! They're coming!
They're coming!

12:45.015 --> 12:46.892
We've got to get out of here!
They're coming this way!

12:47.017 --> 12:49.311
- Who's coming this way?
- The cannibals. Don't you know?!

12:49.436 --> 12:51.271
The meteor destroyed
all society, Butters.

12:51.396 --> 12:53.732
Now Earth is ruled by packs
of wild humans gone mad!

12:53.857 --> 12:55.525
Those who survived
are now being hunted

12:55.650 --> 12:56.860
by flesh-starved cannibals!

12:56.985 --> 12:58.862
Oh, God!
I hate cannibals!

12:58.987 --> 13:00.697
They're coming this way.
I can hear them.

13:00.822 --> 13:02.199
They'll find you down here
for sure.

13:02.324 --> 13:03.909
And when they do,
they'll eat you alive.

13:04.034 --> 13:04.826
No!

13:04.951 --> 13:06.286
We got to get you out of here!
Come on!

13:06.411 --> 13:08.914
Oh, no! Wait! I forgot!
The toxic radiation!

13:09.039 --> 13:10.749
Hey, wait.
We can use this box.

13:10.874 --> 13:13.376
There we go. That should keep
you protected from the toxins.

13:13.502 --> 13:14.878
But I can't see nothing.

13:15.003 --> 13:17.506
Believe me, Butters, you don't
want to see what's up there.

13:17.631 --> 13:20.091
Now, come on. I'll guide you
to a safer location.

13:21.468 --> 13:23.929
There you go. Two more steps
and you're at the top.

13:24.054 --> 13:26.139
- Good.
- Are we out in the destruction?

13:26.264 --> 13:27.057
Yes.

13:27.182 --> 13:28.975
There's nothing but smoldering
bodies all around you,

13:29.100 --> 13:31.561
burnt-out buildings,
and what used to be our town.

13:31.686 --> 13:33.355
- Oh, man.
- All right. This way, Butters.

13:33.480 --> 13:35.398
Just follow the sound
of my voice.

13:35.524 --> 13:38.068
Right now we're walking by
what used to be people's houses,

13:38.193 --> 13:39.986
now just smoldering,
burnt piles of rubble.

13:40.111 --> 13:42.239
Oh.
Oh, it's terrible.

13:42.364 --> 13:44.241
We're coming now to the crater
where the meteor hit --

13:44.366 --> 13:46.284
a hole in the earth
over two miles in diameter.

13:46.409 --> 13:47.661
Whoa.

13:48.787 --> 13:50.247
Here we are
at the old gas station.

13:50.372 --> 13:53.458
It survived a lot of the impact.
We might be safe here.

13:53.583 --> 13:55.502
Bragh-agh-agh-agh-agh!
Oh, my God!

13:55.627 --> 13:56.419
What?

13:56.545 --> 13:58.630
It's a cannibal!
Stay back, cannibal!

13:58.755 --> 14:00.465
Bragh-agh-agh-agh-bragh!

14:01.758 --> 14:03.969
I've got to fight them off!

14:04.094 --> 14:06.137
Stay away from Butters!
He's humanity's last hope!

14:06.263 --> 14:07.973
Bragh-agh-agh-agh-agh!
Bragh-agh-agh-agh-agh!

14:08.098 --> 14:09.140
Aah!
He bit me!

14:09.266 --> 14:11.810
He bit off my hand!

14:11.935 --> 14:14.020
Oh, God! He's eating my hand
like a piece of chicken!

14:14.145 --> 14:16.022
Can you hear the bones crack?
Agh-nagh-nagh!

14:16.147 --> 14:17.774
Agh-nagh-nagh-Nagh!

14:17.899 --> 14:19.734
- Oh!
- Wait! Look here!

14:19.860 --> 14:21.444
There's a dead body
with an ax in the back!

14:21.570 --> 14:24.155
I'll pull out the ax and use it
to cut off the cannibal's head!

14:24.281 --> 14:25.615
Bragh-agh!

14:25.740 --> 14:27.450
Die!

14:27.576 --> 14:29.995
Ooh! What happened?
What happened?!

14:30.120 --> 14:31.913
The cannibal...

14:32.038 --> 14:33.331
The cannibal is dead, Butters.

14:33.456 --> 14:35.417
But he bit me, which means
soon I will have a thirst

14:35.542 --> 14:37.294
- for human flesh as well.
- Oh, no!

14:37.419 --> 14:38.378
We have no choice, Butters.

14:38.503 --> 14:40.380
We have to lock you away
where even I can't get to you.

14:40.505 --> 14:41.214
W-Where?

14:41.339 --> 14:44.175
Look.
There's an old refrigerator.

14:44.301 --> 14:45.051
Get inside, Butters!

14:45.176 --> 14:46.636
I'll break off the handle
so nobody can get to you.

14:46.761 --> 14:47.470
Are you coming?

14:47.596 --> 14:48.763
It's too late for me.

14:48.889 --> 14:50.849
I can already feel my body
start to change.

14:50.974 --> 14:54.185
No! Must fight it!

14:55.020 --> 14:56.605
Don't open this door
for anybody, Butters.

14:56.730 --> 14:59.691
No matter what you hear,
stay inside for four days.

14:59.816 --> 15:01.276
Here's some water and food
from the shelter.

15:01.401 --> 15:04.487
Eric, you're the best friend
in the whole world.

15:04.613 --> 15:06.323
I...I love you.

15:06.448 --> 15:07.741
I love you, too, man.

15:07.866 --> 15:10.785
I just --
Oh! You look so delicious!

15:10.911 --> 15:14.289
Must eat your brains!

15:29.888 --> 15:32.098
Ha!

15:32.974 --> 15:35.393
It's Wednesday!
It's Wednesday!

15:35.518 --> 15:38.730
Only three more days
to Casa Bonita.

15:38.855 --> 15:40.565
I'm gonna go through
Black Bart's cave first.

15:40.690 --> 15:42.484
No. I'm gonna watch
the cliff divers first.

15:42.609 --> 15:43.944
Maybe if I tell 'em
it's my birthday,

15:44.069 --> 15:45.528
they'll let me cliff-dive
into the pool.

15:45.654 --> 15:47.364
Oh, that would be so badass.

15:58.541 --> 16:01.002
Oh.
Finally I can breathe the --

16:01.127 --> 16:02.212
Oh, my God.

16:03.672 --> 16:07.050
Oh, my God.
The meteor took out everything!

16:07.676 --> 16:09.094
It's all destroyed.

16:09.219 --> 16:10.303
Nothing left.

16:11.346 --> 16:12.639
Hello?

16:12.764 --> 16:15.725
Are there any --
Are there any other survivors?

16:16.434 --> 16:17.727
Hello?

16:17.852 --> 16:20.230
Oh, that must have been
where the library was.

16:20.355 --> 16:21.898
And that was probably
the school.

16:22.023 --> 16:22.899
Hello?

16:24.192 --> 16:25.151
Oh, I forgot.

16:25.276 --> 16:27.570
I got to watch out
for radioactive cannibals.

16:27.696 --> 16:30.365
Is that a cannibal?

16:30.490 --> 16:32.617
Sir? Ma'am?

16:35.870 --> 16:36.788
Oh.

16:36.913 --> 16:38.665
Aw!
It's a little dog.

16:38.790 --> 16:40.250
Well, hello there, Mr. Dog.

16:40.375 --> 16:42.836
Looks like you and me
are the only ones that survived.

16:42.961 --> 16:44.796
We should stick together,
huh, Mr. Dog?

16:44.921 --> 16:45.839
Well, come on.

16:45.964 --> 16:47.674
We got to start cleaning up
this mess

16:47.799 --> 16:49.384
and rebuilding civilization.

16:49.509 --> 16:52.762
Boy, that meteor sure did make
everything stinky.

16:56.099 --> 16:59.019
♪ We're on our way
to Casa Boni-ta ♪

16:59.144 --> 17:00.895
♪ We're gonna be there
very soon ♪

17:01.021 --> 17:02.522
You are gonna love Casa Bonita,
Stan.

17:02.647 --> 17:05.233
There's this part where you can
dress up in old Western clothes

17:05.358 --> 17:06.943
and get your photo taken
in a fake jail.

17:07.068 --> 17:08.653
- Really?
- Yeah. It's pretty cool.

17:08.778 --> 17:09.863
"Pretty cool"?

17:09.988 --> 17:11.573
So should we go
to Black Bart's cave first

17:11.698 --> 17:12.615
or watch the puppet show?

17:12.741 --> 17:14.117
I think we should go through
Black Bart's cave right away

17:14.242 --> 17:15.785
'cause we're gonna want to do it
seven or eight times.

17:15.910 --> 17:17.912
Then we'll watch the cliff
divers before the puppet show.

17:18.038 --> 17:18.955
Dude, it's Kyle's birthday.

17:19.080 --> 17:20.290
We should do
whatever he wants to do.

17:20.415 --> 17:22.042
What?
Fuck Kyle.

17:24.544 --> 17:27.088
Ha ha. J-Just kidding!
Birthday joke.

17:27.213 --> 17:29.007
Of course we do

Hello?

17:59.287 --> 18:00.830
Who are you?
Are you infected?

18:00.955 --> 18:02.082
With what?

18:02.207 --> 18:03.416
You're not a cannibal, are you?

18:03.541 --> 18:04.793
No.

18:04.918 --> 18:06.795
Oh.
Oh, good.

18:06.920 --> 18:08.129
You're a survivor, like me.

18:08.254 --> 18:09.714
Look, Mr. Dog.
Another survivor.

18:09.839 --> 18:10.799
And it's a lady, too.

18:10.924 --> 18:14.052
That means we <i>can</i> repopulate
the earth. Yippee!

18:14.677 --> 18:16.262
Kid, what are you doing here?

18:16.387 --> 18:17.597
I'm rebuilding society.

18:17.722 --> 18:19.724
Here.
Take a look.

18:19.849 --> 18:22.060
This is the library.
And over here is the bank.

18:22.185 --> 18:24.395
That over there I'm thinking
of making into a P.F. Chang's

18:24.521 --> 18:25.480
or a Bennigan's.

18:25.605 --> 18:28.274
And this is a memorial
to Eric Cartman,

18:28.399 --> 18:31.194
the person who gave his life
so that I could rebuild society.

18:31.319 --> 18:32.779
Well, ma'am,
I guess we should start

18:32.904 --> 18:35.115
repopulating the earth, huh?

18:36.574 --> 18:38.243
I'm ready whenever you are.

18:38.368 --> 18:41.371
Kid, I don't know
what you think is going on,

18:41.496 --> 18:43.498
but this place is a dump.

18:43.623 --> 18:45.125
Hey!
That's not very nice.

18:45.250 --> 18:47.669
This is my first society.
I'm doing my best.

18:47.794 --> 18:50.338
No. I mean
you're at the garbage dump.

18:50.463 --> 18:52.757
Town is right over there,
everybody is fine,

18:52.882 --> 18:55.885
and I think they've been looking
for you for over a week.

19:01.933 --> 19:03.434
Oh.

19:05.854 --> 19:07.897
Ma'am, can I use your phone?

19:08.523 --> 19:10.483
We're here! We're here!

19:10.608 --> 19:11.985
Casa Bonita!

19:12.110 --> 19:14.154
Oh, man!
This is gonna be so great!

19:14.279 --> 19:16.281
Wait up, Eric.
We need to stay together.

19:16.406 --> 19:18.241
Hold on, boys.

19:18.366 --> 19:19.701
That's my cellphone.

19:19.826 --> 19:21.619
Hello?

19:21.744 --> 19:23.371
Yes.

19:23.496 --> 19:24.873
Oh!
That's great!

19:24.998 --> 19:26.916
Boys, they found Butters.
He's okay!

19:27.041 --> 19:29.085
- Oh, awesome.
- I knew he'd turn up.

19:29.210 --> 19:32.213
Yes, Eric Cartman is with us.
Why?

19:33.047 --> 19:35.175
- Oh, <i>really?</i>
- What?

19:35.300 --> 19:37.343
Yes, I will certainly
let him know.

19:37.468 --> 19:38.845
Thank you.

19:38.970 --> 19:40.513
Well, it appears that Eric here

19:40.638 --> 19:42.265
is responsible
for Butters missing

19:42.390 --> 19:44.392
because <i>he</i> wanted to go
to Casa Bonita.

19:44.517 --> 19:45.143
What?

19:45.268 --> 19:48.188
Eric, the South Park police
are already on their way here

19:48.313 --> 19:49.814
to have a little talk with you.

19:49.939 --> 19:51.274
But...Casa Bonita.

19:51.399 --> 19:52.567
I should have known better.

19:52.692 --> 19:54.569
You never cared
about my birthday at all.

19:54.694 --> 19:56.029
But I -- But...

19:56.154 --> 19:57.363
Stand back!

19:57.488 --> 19:58.323
Cartman, stop it.

19:58.448 --> 20:01.910
I am going to Casa Bonita.

20:02.035 --> 20:03.786
It's too late, fat-ass.

20:03.912 --> 20:05.872
They'll be here
in less than a minute.

20:05.997 --> 20:07.248
Aah!

20:07.373 --> 20:09.626
Less than a minute.
Less than a minute!

20:09.751 --> 20:10.835
Cartman!

20:13.296 --> 20:15.590
Oh, awesome!

20:15.715 --> 20:16.716
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

20:16.841 --> 20:19.886
Can I just eat some of your --
Thank you. Thank you.

20:20.011 --> 20:22.347
Okay. Oh!
Got to get to Black Bart's cave!

20:22.472 --> 20:24.015
Excuse me!
Excuse me!

20:24.140 --> 20:25.266
Coming through.
Black Bart's cave.

20:25.391 --> 20:27.644
Oh! Oh, scary!
Look! A skeleton!

20:27.769 --> 20:29.145
Oh, man, I'm so scared.

20:30.939 --> 20:33.775
Oh, that was awesome.
Oh! Cliff divers!

20:38.446 --> 20:40.657
Come on!
Come on! Dive!

20:40.782 --> 20:42.951
Dive, asshole!

20:43.076 --> 20:46.496
Oh, awesome!
That was cool, huh?

20:48.498 --> 20:49.540
Ah!

20:50.792 --> 20:52.835
Come on.
Come on.

20:56.839 --> 20:57.799
Sopaipillas!

20:57.924 --> 20:59.717
Can I get some sopaipillas,
please?!

20:59.842 --> 21:01.135
Sweet.

21:01.261 --> 21:03.972
Oh! Ooh! Puppet show!
Puppet show!

21:04.097 --> 21:05.014
Aah!

21:05.139 --> 21:06.724
- Cartman!
- Aah!

21:08.518 --> 21:10.186
All right, kid.
End of the line.

21:13.898 --> 21:15.358
Yes!

21:15.483 --> 21:17.318
Jesus Christ!

21:25.118 --> 21:27.620
Well, kid, you made
an entire town panic,

21:27.745 --> 21:29.038
you lost all your friends,

21:29.163 --> 21:31.916
and now you're going
to juvenile hall for a week.

21:32.041 --> 21:34.085
Was it worth it?

21:34.669 --> 21:36.796
Totally.
