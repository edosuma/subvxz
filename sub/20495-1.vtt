05:20.019 --> 05:23.012
		TO REALLY SEE WHAT'S GOING ON

05:23.014 --> 05:26.004
BEHIND THE SCENES

05:23.014 --> 05:26.004
	OF THIS COMPANY.

05:26.005 --> 05:27.007
-GOOD TO SEE YOU.

05:26.005 --> 05:27.007
	-Mike: GOOD TO SEE YOU.

05:27.009 --> 05:28.019
		THIS IS OUR WAREHOUSE.

05:28.019 --> 05:30.014
	THIS IS KIND OF

05:28.019 --> 05:30.014
THE START OF THE PROCESS.

05:30.014 --> 05:32.007
		ALL OF OUR SHELVES ARE THERE.

05:30.014 --> 05:32.007
		A LOT OF CUSTOM STUFF.

05:32.009 --> 05:34.011
	Lemonis:

05:32.009 --> 05:34.011
		HOW YOU DOING, BUDDY?

05:34.012 --> 05:35.026
			Chris: HEY, MARCUS.

05:35.026 --> 05:37.014
			Lemonis: SO,

05:35.026 --> 05:37.014
	THE RAW MATERIALS COME IN HERE.

05:37.016 --> 05:39.019
		WHO SCHEDULES

05:37.016 --> 05:39.019
THE WORKFLOW THAT HAPPENS?

05:39.019 --> 05:42.009
Chris: I SCHEDULE

05:39.019 --> 05:42.009
	EVERY ORDER THAT COMES THROUGH.

05:42.009 --> 05:44.007
			Lemonis: SO WHO'S IN CHARGE

05:42.009 --> 05:44.007
OF SALES?

05:44.007 --> 05:45.014
	-Mike: ME.

05:44.007 --> 05:45.014
	-Lemonis: WHO GENERATES

05:45.016 --> 05:46.019
		THE ACTUAL SALE ORDER,

05:45.016 --> 05:46.019
THE QUOTE?

05:46.019 --> 05:48.012
			Mike: I DO.

05:48.012 --> 05:49.024
			Lemonis: AND WHO MAKES SURE

05:48.012 --> 05:49.024
THAT IT'S PRICED PROPERLY?

05:49.024 --> 05:51.014
	Chris: I CREATED

05:49.024 --> 05:51.014
THE PRICING TOOL,

05:51.016 --> 05:53.007
		AND MIKE SAID,

05:51.016 --> 05:53.007
			"THESE PRICES ARE TOO HIGH."

05:54.021 --> 05:57.014
		Mike:

05:54.021 --> 05:57.014
			I'M TRYING TO BE COMPETITIVE

05:54.021 --> 05:57.014
	TO -- TO GET SALES IN THE DOOR.

05:57.014 --> 06:00.007
	Lemonis: SO YOU'RE INEFFICIENT,

05:57.014 --> 06:00.007
	AND YOU'RE PRICED BELOW MARKET,

06:00.007 --> 06:03.007
	WHICH MEANS YOU HAVE HIGH COSTS

06:00.007 --> 06:03.007
		AND NO MARGIN.

06:04.007 --> 06:06.007
		DEATH SPIRAL.

06:07.004 --> 06:08.028
		THE GUY WHO'S

06:07.004 --> 06:08.028
MANUFACTURING THE PRODUCT

06:09.000 --> 06:11.018
	AND KNOWS ALL THE NUMBERS ISN'T

06:09.000 --> 06:11.018
		ALLOWED TO PRICE THE PRODUCT?

06:11.019 --> 06:13.018
	WE'RE GONNA LET

06:11.019 --> 06:13.018
		THE SALESMAN PRICE IT?

06:13.019 --> 06:15.019
	NOT A GOOD IDEA.

06:18.014 --> 06:20.004
			ARE THESE ORGANIZED IN A WAY

06:20.005 --> 06:22.012
		OR WOULD YOU SAY IT'S

06:20.005 --> 06:22.012
		A LITTLE JACKED-UP RIGHT NOW?

06:22.014 --> 06:23.026
	Chris: IT'S NOT TOO BAD.

06:23.026 --> 06:26.011
	Lemonis: IT DOESN'T LOOK

06:23.026 --> 06:26.011
		SUPER-ORGANIZED TO ME.

06:26.012 --> 06:28.021
		DISORGANIZED MATERIALS

06:26.012 --> 06:28.021
			EQUALS LOSS OF TIME,

06:28.021 --> 06:30.021
			WHICH EQUALS LOSS OF LABOR,

06:30.021 --> 06:32.024
			WHICH MEANS

06:30.021 --> 06:32.024
		MONEY IS LEAKING OUT THE DOOR.

06:32.026 --> 06:34.018
	I SEE BOXES EVERYWHERE.

06:34.019 --> 06:37.009
			I SEE PILES OF CRAP

06:34.019 --> 06:37.009
		BEYOND BELIEF.

06:37.009 --> 06:41.014
	I'M NOT SURE HOW THEY EVEN MAKE

06:37.009 --> 06:41.014
			THE QUALITY OF DRUM

06:41.016 --> 06:43.026
	THAT I'VE SEEN AND I'VE TOUCHED

06:41.016 --> 06:43.026
IN THIS WAREHOUSE.

06:43.026 --> 06:45.014
			WHERE IS EVERYBODY?

06:45.014 --> 06:46.026
		Chris: THERE'S PEOPLE

06:45.014 --> 06:46.026
			WORKING BACK THERE.

06:46.028 --> 06:48.009
		Lemonis: I WANT TO SEE

06:46.028 --> 06:48.009
			WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

06:48.011 --> 06:50.019
			MAKING A CUSTOM DRUM

06:48.011 --> 06:50.019
	IS VERY LABOR-INTENSIVE.

06:50.021 --> 06:53.014
	EACH TUBE HAS TO BE CUT

06:50.021 --> 06:53.014
		JUST TO SIZE,

06:53.016 --> 06:57.026
			THEN SANDED,

06:53.016 --> 06:57.026
	THEN PAINTED OR STAINED.

06:58.021 --> 07:01.019
	AND THE LOOPS THAT HOLD

06:58.021 --> 07:01.019
THE SKIN TO THE DRUM SHELL

07:01.021 --> 07:03.014
		ARE ALSO MADE BY HAND.

07:03.014 --> 07:05.021
	AND THEN THERE'S

07:03.014 --> 07:05.021
			A BUNCH OF HARDWARE OPTIONS

07:05.023 --> 07:07.009
	TO PUT IT ALL TOGETHER.

07:07.009 --> 07:09.012
BUT BECAUSE THIS WAREHOUSE

07:07.009 --> 07:09.012
			IS SO DISORGANIZED,

07:09.014 --> 07:11.004
	THEY'RE WASTING

07:09.014 --> 07:11.004
		A TON OF TIME

07:11.004 --> 07:13.007
		TRYING TO FIND

07:11.004 --> 07:13.007
		THE PARTS AND PIECES.

07:13.007 --> 07:16.009
	AND ALL OF THESE INEFFICIENCIES

07:13.007 --> 07:16.009
INCREASE PRODUCTION TIME,

07:16.009 --> 07:18.004
WHICH KILLS THEIR MARGINS.

07:18.005 --> 07:20.004
		Mike: SO, WHAT THEY'RE

07:18.005 --> 07:20.004
		DOING RIGHT NOW IS THEY'RE --

07:20.005 --> 07:22.004
	IT'S IN

07:20.005 --> 07:22.004
THE FINAL ASSEMBLY STAGE.

07:22.005 --> 07:24.004
	-Lemonis: HELLO. I'M MARCUS.

07:22.005 --> 07:24.004
	-Josh: JOSH. NICE TO MEET YOU.

07:24.005 --> 07:26.011
	Lemonis: HEY, NICE TO MEET YOU.

07:24.005 --> 07:26.011
			HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN HERE?

07:26.012 --> 07:28.004
		Josh:

07:26.012 --> 07:28.004
			THIS WILL BE MY EIGHTH YEAR.

07:28.005 --> 07:29.014
Lemonis: WOW. WHAT'S BEEN

07:28.005 --> 07:29.014
	THE CRAZIEST PART OF IT?

07:29.016 --> 07:31.007
		Josh: JUST THE HUSTLE.

07:31.009 --> 07:32.024
			Lemonis: HOW STRESSFUL IS IT

07:31.009 --> 07:32.024
	WORKING HERE RIGHT NOW?

07:32.024 --> 07:34.005
	Louie: PRETTY STRESSFUL.

07:34.007 --> 07:35.019
			Matt: WE GET ORDERS

07:34.007 --> 07:35.019
			ALL THE TIME

07:35.019 --> 07:37.007
THAT COME STRAIGHT

07:35.019 --> 07:37.007
		FROM THE FRONT OFFICE,

07:37.009 --> 07:39.007
		AND IT'S LIKE,

07:37.009 --> 07:39.007
		"WE NEED THIS KIT YESTERDAY."

07:39.009 --> 07:40.024
	Lemonis:

07:39.009 --> 07:40.024
			SO WHOSE FAULT WOULD IT BE?

07:40.026 --> 07:43.004
Matt: MIKE'S. SO THEN WE HAVE TO

07:40.026 --> 07:43.004
GO AROUND THE WHOLE SHOP

07:43.005 --> 07:45.009
	AND FIND DIFFERENT PARTS

07:43.005 --> 07:45.009
	TO MAKE THE KIT.

07:45.011 --> 07:46.024
	Josh: EVERY TIME

07:45.011 --> 07:46.024
WE TRY TO SET A SCHEDULE,

07:46.024 --> 07:48.019
YOU'RE CONSTANTLY STOPPING

07:46.024 --> 07:48.019
	AND GOING BACK,

07:48.021 --> 07:50.021
		BECAUSE THIS KIT ENDS UP BEING

07:48.021 --> 07:50.021
			MORE OF A PRIORITY.

07:50.023 --> 07:52.024
		Louie: MIKE WILL COME OUT AND

07:50.023 --> 07:52.024
		SAY, "WE NEED THIS KIT DONE."

07:52.024 --> 07:54.005
AND WE KNOW WE DON'T HAVE

07:52.024 --> 07:54.005
	THE PARTS, SO I'LL SAY,

07:54.007 --> 07:56.000
	"CHRIS,

07:54.007 --> 07:56.000
WE DON'T HAVE THE PARTS."

07:56.000 --> 07:57.011
			HE GOES, "YEAH, DON'T WORRY

07:56.000 --> 07:57.011
		ABOUT THAT ONE. DO THIS ONE."

07:57.012 --> 07:59.019
	SO IT'S LIKE --

07:57.012 --> 07:59.019
			IT'S JUST...

07:59.021 --> 08:01.012
COMPOUNDED

07:59.021 --> 08:01.012
THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE SHOP.

08:01.012 --> 08:03.005
	Lemonis:

08:01.012 --> 08:03.005
THE MOST DISTURBING THING

08:03.007 --> 08:05.016
ABOUT THEIR MANUFACTURING

08:03.007 --> 08:05.016
	PROCESS IS THERE IS NO PROCESS.

08:05.017 --> 08:08.004
			THE REASON IT TAKES

08:05.017 --> 08:08.004
SIX MONTHS TO MAKE A DRUM

08:08.004 --> 08:09.021
IS THEY DON'T KNOW

08:08.004 --> 08:09.021
			WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

08:09.023 --> 08:11.016
		Chris: WE'VE BEEN A LITTLE BIT

08:09.023 --> 08:11.016
BEHIND ON CHECKS.

08:11.018 --> 08:13.021
	Lemonis:

08:11.018 --> 08:13.021
	WHO ARE THESE CHECKS TO?

08:13.023 --> 08:15.019
	Chris: GOT RENT.

08:13.023 --> 08:15.019
	WE HAVE CHECKS TO FedEx.

08:15.019 --> 08:18.016
		AND WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY

08:15.019 --> 08:18.016
	TO COVER PAYROLL FOR NEXT WEEK.

08:18.018 --> 08:21.021
			WE'RE PRETTY MUCH

08:18.018 --> 08:21.021
			AT ZERO RIGHT NOW.

08:21.023 --> 08:24.004
			Lemonis: I DIDN'T GET THE

08:21.023 --> 08:24.004
IMPRESSION THAT IT WAS THAT DIRE

08:24.005 --> 08:26.023
WHEN I WAS OUT IN N.A.M.M.

08:24.005 --> 08:26.023
WITH YOU.

08:26.024 --> 08:28.009
		Mike:

08:26.024 --> 08:28.009
		IT WAS DIRE BACK THEN.

08:28.009 --> 08:30.023
IT'S JUST KIND OF SLOWLY

08:28.009 --> 08:30.023
BEEN GETTING MORE DIRE.

08:30.024 --> 08:32.024
	Lemonis:

08:30.024 --> 08:32.024
		YOU'RE KIND OF ALMOST CLOSED.

08:32.025 --> 08:35.009
			-Mike: YEP.

08:32.025 --> 08:35.009
			-Chris: PRETTY CLOSE, YEAH.

08:37.014 --> 08:40.018
		Lemonis: NOW THAT I'VE SEEN

08:37.014 --> 08:40.018
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THEIR PROCESS,

08:40.019 --> 08:43.004
		I NEED TO LOOK AT THE NUMBERS

08:43.005 --> 08:45.010
		AND REALLY UNDERSTAND WHERE

08:43.005 --> 08:45.010
		THE HOLES ARE IN THE SYSTEM.

08:45.011 --> 08:46.020
		Chris:

08:45.011 --> 08:46.020
			I HAVE THE LAST THREE YEARS'

08:46.022 --> 08:48.015
	INCOME STATEMENT

08:46.022 --> 08:48.015
AND BALANCE SHEET.

08:49.019 --> 08:51.018
Lemonis: YOU HAVE $45,000

08:49.019 --> 08:51.018
	IN CREDIT CARDS.

08:51.019 --> 08:54.008
YOU HAVE $35,000 IN CHECKS

08:51.019 --> 08:54.008
			THAT YOU CAN'T MAIL

08:54.009 --> 08:56.017
	AND ANOTHER $20,000 TO VENDORS.

08:56.018 --> 08:58.005
			Chris: YEAH.

08:58.006 --> 09:00.010
			Lemonis: $200,000 OF PRODUCT

08:58.006 --> 09:00.010
OWED TO CUSTOMERS.

09:00.011 --> 09:03.022
	THE TOTAL HAPPENS TO BE

09:00.011 --> 09:03.022
		RIGHT AROUND $300,000.

09:03.023 --> 09:05.025
			Mike: YEAH.

09:05.027 --> 09:08.014
	Lemonis: SO, IN THE LAST

09:05.027 --> 09:08.014
	12 MONTHS, YOU DID ABOUT

09:08.015 --> 09:12.013
			$1 MILLION IN SALES

09:08.015 --> 09:12.013
		AND YOU LOST ABOUT 200 GRAND.

09:13.019 --> 09:15.008
			WHAT ARE YOUR GROSS MARGINS?

09:15.009 --> 09:17.011
	Mike: OUR GROSS MARGINS

09:15.009 --> 09:17.011
LAST YEAR WERE ABOUT 20%.

09:17.013 --> 09:19.004
			Lemonis: WHAT SHOULD

09:17.013 --> 09:19.004
		THE MARGINS BE, CHRIS?

09:19.004 --> 09:21.019
Chris: IN MY MIND,

09:19.004 --> 09:21.019
THEY NEED TO BE LIKE 40%.

09:21.020 --> 09:24.004
Lemonis: WHICH IS

09:21.020 --> 09:24.004
	BASICALLY THE DIFFERENCE

09:24.004 --> 09:26.008
	BETWEEN LOSING 200 GRAND

09:24.004 --> 09:26.008
OR BREAKING EVEN.

09:26.009 --> 09:28.006
			IN THE PRICING MODEL

09:26.009 --> 09:28.006
THAT YOU'VE PUT TOGETHER,

09:28.008 --> 09:30.013
	IF MIKE WOULD HAVE STAYED AWAY

09:28.008 --> 09:30.013
FROM IT, WOULD IT HAVE BEEN 40%?

09:30.014 --> 09:32.011
			Chris: YES.

09:33.010 --> 09:35.008
Lemonis: ONE OF THE THINGS

09:33.010 --> 09:35.008
THAT I LIKE ABOUT CHRIS --

09:35.009 --> 09:37.018
HE'S VERY FOCUSED

09:35.009 --> 09:37.018
	ON THE NUMBERS.

09:37.019 --> 09:40.009
		HE HAS A LOT OF THE ANSWERS TO

09:37.019 --> 09:40.009
		THE QUESTIONS THAT I'M ASKING.

09:40.010 --> 09:42.019
I'M A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED

09:40.010 --> 09:42.019
		THAT MIKE ISN'T TAKING

09:42.020 --> 09:45.008
		ADVANTAGE OF THIS ASSET THAT'S

09:42.020 --> 09:45.008
		SITTING RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM.

09:45.009 --> 09:48.023
		IN 2014, YOU SOLD LESS

09:45.009 --> 09:48.023
		AND THINGS GOT WORSE.

09:48.024 --> 09:49.024
			Chris: YEAH.

09:49.024 --> 09:51.023
	Lemonis:

09:49.024 --> 09:51.023
WHAT ELSE CHANGED?

09:51.024 --> 09:54.024
	-Mike: SCOTT LEFT IN '13.

09:51.024 --> 09:54.024
	-Lemonis: SCOTT'S YOUR BROTHER?

09:56.022 --> 09:58.008
	AND HOW MUCH EQUITY DID HE OWN?

09:58.009 --> 09:59.024
		Mike:

09:58.009 --> 09:59.024
	WE WERE 50/50 PARTNERS.

09:59.025 --> 10:02.004
		Lemonis: HOW MUCH DID YOU PAY

09:59.025 --> 10:02.004
	TO BUY HIM OUT?

10:02.005 --> 10:04.005
	Mike: TO BUY HIM OUT --

10:02.005 --> 10:04.005
$533,000,

10:04.006 --> 10:06.014
	WHICH IS $2,000 A MONTH

10:04.006 --> 10:06.014
		FOR THE NEXT 15 YEARS

10:06.014 --> 10:09.014
		AND A BALLOON PAYMENT

10:06.014 --> 10:09.014
	OF $285,000 AT YEAR 15.

10:09.014 --> 10:11.014
		Lemonis: AND HOW DID THAT FEEL

10:09.014 --> 10:11.014
	LIKE A GOOD DEAL TO YOU?

10:11.014 --> 10:13.011
	-Mike: IT DIDN'T.

10:11.014 --> 10:13.011
	-Lemonis: SO WHY DID YOU DO IT?

10:13.013 --> 10:14.017
		Mike: I DIDN'T WANT TO

10:13.013 --> 10:14.017
			SHORTCHANGE HIM AND BE LIKE,

10:14.018 --> 10:16.010
"I'LL GIVE YOU 100 GRAND.

10:14.018 --> 10:16.010
GET OUT."

10:16.011 --> 10:17.024
	Lemonis: AND SO THE FACT

10:16.011 --> 10:17.024
		THAT YOU WERE WILLING

10:17.024 --> 10:19.019
			TO PUT YOUR BROTHER

10:17.024 --> 10:19.019
AHEAD OF YOURSELF

10:19.019 --> 10:21.006
SAYS A LOT

10:19.019 --> 10:21.006
		ABOUT YOUR CHARACTER.

17:04.028 --> 17:07.022
		Matt: DEFINITELY SAVE THAT ONE

17:04.028 --> 17:07.022
	FOR THE -- THE BASE KIT.

17:07.025 --> 17:09.009
			WHAT IF YOU SHRINK

17:07.025 --> 17:09.009
			THE RACK TOM SIZE

17:09.009 --> 17:10.028
	SO YOU CAN GET THE MOST

17:09.009 --> 17:10.028
			OUT OF A FULL TUBE?

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
		Pat: WE SHOULD TALK

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
		FINISH-WISE, THOUGH.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.011
	Lemonis:

17:13.000 --> 17:14.011
	HOW ARE YOU GUYS DOING?

17:14.012 --> 17:16.012
			Chris: UM...

17:16.015 --> 17:20.000
WE'RE HAVING SOME TROUBLE

17:16.015 --> 17:20.000
			TRYING TO GET THE PRICE DOWN

17:20.000 --> 17:21.008
			-ON THE "GOOD" KIT.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.008
			-Lemonis: WHAT'S THE ISSUE?

17:21.009 --> 17:22.025
Chris: MOST OF OUR

17:21.009 --> 17:22.025
	METAL COMPONENTS

17:22.026 --> 17:26.005
ARE ABOUT THE SAME PRICE

17:22.026 --> 17:26.005
NO MATTER WHAT YOU USE,

17:26.006 --> 17:28.026
	SO WE'RE TRYING TO FIND

17:26.006 --> 17:28.026
			OTHER WAYS AROUND IT

17:28.027 --> 17:31.026
TO REDUCE EITHER COST OF,

17:28.027 --> 17:31.026
			YOU KNOW, FINISHING.

17:31.027 --> 17:33.005
	Lemonis:

17:31.027 --> 17:33.005
	I THINK THE KEY WOULD BE

17:33.006 --> 17:34.028
			REALLY JUST

17:33.006 --> 17:34.028
	SIMPLIFYING THE PROCESS.

17:34.028 --> 17:38.003
AS I LISTEN TO THESE GUYS,

17:34.028 --> 17:38.003
			THEY CAN'T SEEM TO GET PAST

17:38.005 --> 17:40.008
			HOW THEY MANUFACTURE

17:38.005 --> 17:40.008
	THE DRUMS		 TODAY,

17:40.009 --> 17:42.008
	AND I'M STARTING

17:40.009 --> 17:42.008
TO GET CONCERNED.

17:42.009 --> 17:45.003
		WHAT I REALLY THINK THEY NEED

17:42.009 --> 17:45.003
	IS A FRESH PERSPECTIVE.

17:45.005 --> 17:47.003
SO LET ME PUT SOME

17:45.005 --> 17:47.003
THOUGHTS IN. I'LL SEE

17:45.005 --> 17:47.003
WHAT I CAN COME UP WITH.

17:47.005 --> 17:49.006
ALL RIGHT,

17:47.005 --> 17:49.006
			KEEP WORKING AT IT, THOUGH.

17:49.007 --> 17:52.012
I THINK THERE MAY BE A SOLUTION.

17:49.007 --> 17:52.012
			IT'S A RISKY ONE.

17:57.028 --> 18:01.023
		-SCOTT?

17:57.028 --> 18:01.023
		-Scott: YES.

18:01.025 --> 18:03.027
		Lemonis: HOW ARE YOU?

18:01.025 --> 18:03.027
NICE TO MEET YOU.

18:03.028 --> 18:06.011
		MIKE'S BROTHER, SCOTT,

18:03.028 --> 18:06.011
	IS THE INNOVATOR OF SJC,

18:06.012 --> 18:08.011
AND SO I WANTED TO ASK HIM

18:06.012 --> 18:08.011
			TO CONSIDER

18:08.012 --> 18:10.028
COMING BACK AND HELPING US

18:08.012 --> 18:10.028
WITH THIS PROCESS.

18:10.028 --> 18:13.005
	IF SCOTT

18:10.028 --> 18:13.005
IS UNWILLING TO COME BACK

18:13.006 --> 18:15.005
	AND HELP US MAKE

18:13.006 --> 18:15.005
		THIS ENTRY-LEVEL DRUM,

18:15.006 --> 18:16.023
THEN THE COMPANY'S

18:15.006 --> 18:16.023
	GONNA STRUGGLE.

18:16.025 --> 18:18.023
		-YOU GOT A SET OF DRUMS HERE.

18:16.025 --> 18:18.023
		-Scott: YEAH.

18:18.025 --> 18:20.025
-Lemonis: YOU STILL PLAY?

18:18.025 --> 18:20.025
-Scott: YES. OF COURSE.

18:20.026 --> 18:22.008
	Lemonis:

18:20.026 --> 18:22.008
		YOU ALSO PLAY GUITAR?

18:22.009 --> 18:24.000
			Scott: WELL,

18:22.009 --> 18:24.000
			I WENT TO SCHOOL FOR MUSIC,

18:24.001 --> 18:26.012
		SO, YEAH, I PICKED UP A LOT OF

18:24.001 --> 18:26.012
INSTRUMENTS ALONG THE WAY.

18:26.013 --> 18:28.012
	Lemonis: YOU WERE THE ARTIST.

18:26.013 --> 18:28.012
	LET'S JUST CALL IT LIKE IT IS.

18:28.013 --> 18:30.009
			Scott: YEAH, I MEAN,

18:28.013 --> 18:30.009
		MIKE DESIGNED DRUMS AND STUFF,

18:30.009 --> 18:32.000
			BUT WHEN I CAME TO,

18:30.009 --> 18:32.000
YOU KNOW,

18:32.000 --> 18:35.000
	PUTTING YOUR HANDS ON IT

18:32.000 --> 18:35.000
		AND DOING IT, THAT WAS ALL ME.

18:35.001 --> 18:37.008
	I, IN MY CAREER,

18:35.001 --> 18:37.008
		HAVE MADE THOUSANDS --

18:37.009 --> 18:40.000
LIKE, I THINK 5,000 DRUMS.

18:40.001 --> 18:41.012
	Lemonis:

18:40.001 --> 18:41.012
		SO, WHAT'S THE STORY?

18:41.013 --> 18:43.003
WHY DID YOU LEAVE?

18:41.013 --> 18:43.003
		WHAT HAPPENED?

18:43.005 --> 18:47.009
		Scott: WELL, MY BROTHER FORMED

18:43.005 --> 18:47.009
	A MUTINY, IS WHAT I SAY,

18:47.009 --> 18:53.002
		WHERE PEOPLE STARTED TO SLOWLY

18:47.009 --> 18:53.002
	BECOME JUST TURNED OFF FROM ME.

18:53.003 --> 18:56.005
			IT COULD HAVE BEEN THE MOST

18:53.003 --> 18:56.005
	INTRICATE DRUM SET IN THE WORLD

18:56.006 --> 18:59.013
FOR THE MOST FAMOUS DRUMMER THAT

18:56.006 --> 18:59.013
I SHOULD BE SO PROUD OF MAKING,

18:59.015 --> 19:02.007
	BUT IT WAS LIKE,

18:59.015 --> 19:02.007
"HE NEEDS IT IN TWO DAYS."

19:02.008 --> 19:05.025
	IT QUICKLY TURNED INTO,

19:02.008 --> 19:05.025
		"WE JUST WANT IT NOW."

19:05.026 --> 19:07.012
			AND IF I DIDN'T GET IT DONE

19:05.026 --> 19:07.012
			IN TWO DAYS,

19:07.013 --> 19:11.009
I WAS PERCEIVED AS

19:07.013 --> 19:11.009
		NOT CARING ABOUT THE BUSINESS.

19:11.010 --> 19:12.028
		Lemonis: HOW?

19:11.010 --> 19:12.028
HOW COULD THAT BE?

19:12.028 --> 19:17.008
Scott: BECAUSE MY BROTHER

19:12.028 --> 19:17.008
		WAS THE GUY UPSTAIRS,

19:17.009 --> 19:20.000
		AND EVERYONE WHO WORKED AT SJC

19:17.009 --> 19:20.000
	WAS HIS FRIEND.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.023
	THEY ALL MADE FUN OF ME,

19:20.000 --> 19:21.023
		AND I WOULD WALK OUT.

19:21.025 --> 19:24.001
		AND THEN MY BROTHER WOULD SAY,

19:21.025 --> 19:24.001
	"SEE, HE DOESN'T CARE."

19:24.002 --> 19:26.003
			Lemonis: THE ISSUES

19:24.002 --> 19:26.003
		BETWEEN THESE BROTHERS

19:26.005 --> 19:28.001
		ARE VERY COMPLICATED,

19:26.005 --> 19:28.001
AND THEY RUN DEEP.

19:28.002 --> 19:30.009
			BUT IF THIS BUSINESS

19:28.002 --> 19:30.009
		IS GONNA BE A SUCCESS,

19:30.010 --> 19:32.000
			THEY HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER.

19:32.000 --> 19:35.003
IT MAY NOT HAPPEN QUICKLY,

19:32.000 --> 19:35.003
		BUT IT HAS TO HAPPEN.

19:35.005 --> 19:36.025
		I HAVE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

19:36.026 --> 19:39.028
I AM A PRETTY GOOD

19:36.026 --> 19:39.028
			JUDGE OF CHARACTER.

19:39.028 --> 19:42.009
		I CAN TELL YOU

19:39.028 --> 19:42.009
			THAT HE FEELS AWFUL.

19:42.009 --> 19:44.008
		HE FEELS LIKE

19:42.009 --> 19:44.008
			HE LOST HIS BROTHER FOREVER.

19:44.009 --> 19:45.028
Scott: HE SHOULD.

19:45.028 --> 19:47.026
	HE SHOULD FEEL THAT WAY

19:45.028 --> 19:47.026
	FOR WHAT HE DID.

19:51.009 --> 19:52.028
I ASKED SCOTT TO COME HERE

19:53.000 --> 19:54.010
	BECAUSE I THINK

19:53.000 --> 19:54.010
			HE COULD BE HELPFUL.

19:54.011 --> 19:58.002
Mike: I'M SCARED TO DEATH

19:54.011 --> 19:58.002
OF HIM BEING HERE.

19:58.003 --> 20:00.025
	Lemonis:

19:58.003 --> 20:00.025
	IS THERE EVER ANY MOMENT

20:00.026 --> 20:02.028
		WHERE YOU GUYS

20:00.026 --> 20:02.028
CAN GET PAST THIS?

20:03.000 --> 20:04.002
Mike: [BLEEP] IT.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.002
I'M GONE.

20:08.020 --> 20:11.010
 HE FEELS AWFUL.

20:11.011 --> 20:14.008
		Scott: HE SHOULD FEEL THAT WAY

20:11.011 --> 20:14.008
	FOR WHAT HE DID.

20:14.009 --> 20:18.006
		Lemonis: FOR WHATEVER THIS IS

20:14.009 --> 20:18.006
	WORTH TO YOU, HE IS DEVASTATED.

20:18.007 --> 20:21.002
		Scott: [ SIGHS ] YEAH.

20:21.003 --> 20:23.000
			Lemonis: SO,

20:21.003 --> 20:23.000
WE MADE A DEAL LAST NIGHT,

20:23.001 --> 20:26.000
	AND I'M PUTTING $400,000

20:23.001 --> 20:26.000
INTO THE BUSINESS.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.002
	THE GOOD NEWS IS

20:26.000 --> 20:28.002
	I'M 100% IN CHARGE NOW.

20:28.003 --> 20:32.000
		AND SO WE'RE GOING TO

20:28.003 --> 20:32.000
		MANUFACTURE A LESS

20:28.003 --> 20:32.000
		EXPENSIVE DRUM.

20:32.000 --> 20:35.000
		IS THERE ANY UNIVERSE

20:35.001 --> 20:38.001
		THAT YOU WOULD EVER RE-INVOLVE

20:35.001 --> 20:38.001
	YOURSELF IN THE BUSINESS

20:38.002 --> 20:40.005
			IF YOU KNEW

20:38.002 --> 20:40.005
		THINGS WERE REALLY DIFFERENT?

20:40.006 --> 20:43.019
	Scott: HE'S NEVER

20:40.006 --> 20:43.019
	SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSED

20:40.006 --> 20:43.019
	THE THINGS THAT HE DID.

20:43.019 --> 20:46.007
-Lemonis: WOULD THAT HELP?

20:43.019 --> 20:46.007
-Scott: IF HE COULD DO IT.

20:46.008 --> 20:48.018
	Lemonis:

20:46.008 --> 20:48.018
	IT WAS NICE MEETING YOU.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.019
			-Lemonis: HEY, BUD.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.019
			-Mike: HEY.

20:52.019 --> 20:55.001
Lemonis: [ SIGHS ]

20:55.002 --> 20:57.001
		I WENT AND MET

20:55.002 --> 20:57.001
WITH YOUR BROTHER.

20:57.002 --> 21:01.010
	-Mike: YOU MET WITH MY BROTHER?

20:57.002 --> 21:01.010
	-Lemonis: YEAH, I DID.

21:02.010 --> 21:05.018
			DO YOU THINK HE COULD HELP

21:02.010 --> 21:05.018
			THIS BUSINESS IN ANY WAY?

21:05.019 --> 21:07.009
Mike: YES.

21:05.019 --> 21:07.009
	I DON'T KNOW HOW TO MAKE DRUMS.

21:07.010 --> 21:09.017
I'M NOT OUT THERE

21:07.010 --> 21:09.017
	BUILDING DRUMS.

21:09.018 --> 21:12.000
	WE WOULD HAVE NEVER HAD

21:09.018 --> 21:12.000
	A COMPANY IF IT WEREN'T

21:09.018 --> 21:12.000
	FOR HIM BUILDING THEM.

21:12.001 --> 21:13.010
	Lemonis:

21:12.001 --> 21:13.010
I ASKED SCOTT TO COME HERE

21:13.011 --> 21:15.008
	BECAUSE I THINK

21:13.011 --> 21:15.008
			HE COULD BE HELPFUL.

21:15.009 --> 21:19.002
Mike: I'M SCARED TO DEATH

21:15.009 --> 21:19.002
OF HIM BEING HERE.

21:19.003 --> 21:21.005
		Lemonis: WHAT I WANT TO DO IS

21:19.003 --> 21:21.005
		STAY FOCUSED ON THE BUSINESS.

21:21.006 --> 21:23.008
		-YOU UNDERSTAND THAT, RIGHT?

21:21.006 --> 21:23.008
		-Mike: YEAH.

21:23.009 --> 21:25.015
	Lemonis:

21:23.009 --> 21:25.015
	AND DEAL WITH YOUR SCARS

21:23.009 --> 21:25.015
			A LITTLE LATER, IF YOU CAN.

21:25.016 --> 21:27.009
			Mike: I CAN DO THAT.

21:30.001 --> 21:34.006
Lemonis:

21:30.001 --> 21:34.006
			LET ME JUST WALK YOU GUYS

21:30.001 --> 21:34.006
THROUGH THIS PROCESS REAL QUICK.

21:34.007 --> 21:37.016
SO, WE'RE GONNA SIMPLIFY THE WAY

21:34.007 --> 21:37.016
WE ACTUALLY MANAGE THE BUSINESS.

21:37.017 --> 21:39.009
	-Josh: YEP.

21:37.017 --> 21:39.009
	-Lemonis: OKAY.

21:39.010 --> 21:41.015
		AND WE'RE GONNA THINK

21:39.010 --> 21:41.015
ABOUT IT IN STEPS.

21:41.016 --> 21:44.007
		-10 STEPS TO SUCCESS.

21:41.016 --> 21:44.007
		-Josh: I LIKE IT.

21:44.008 --> 21:48.013
	Lemonis:

21:44.008 --> 21:48.013
			SJC's MANUFACTURING PROCESS

21:44.008 --> 21:48.013
	IS IN DESPERATE NEED OF REPAIR.

21:48.015 --> 21:50.028
			ORDERS HAVE STALLED BECAUSE

21:48.015 --> 21:50.028
		THEY DON'T HAVE ALL THE PARTS.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.021
MATERIALS ARE EVERYWHERE.

21:52.022 --> 21:56.005
IN ORDER TO FIX THAT, I'M GONNA

21:52.022 --> 21:56.005
INSTALL THE 10 STEPS TO SUCCESS.

21:56.006 --> 21:59.001
	RIGHT HERE IS BASICALLY

21:56.006 --> 21:59.001
WHERE OUR 10 STEPS START.

21:59.002 --> 22:01.007
UP THERE'S GONNA BE A BIG,

21:59.002 --> 22:01.007
	ELECTRONIC BOARD

22:01.008 --> 22:04.000
	AND IT'S GONNA HAVE EVERY ORDER

22:01.008 --> 22:04.000
THAT'S OUT THERE.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.017
THERE'S GONNA BE CARTS LIKE THIS

22:04.000 --> 22:05.017
		WITH BUCKETS JUST LIKE THIS.

22:05.018 --> 22:07.007
Pat: YEP.

22:07.008 --> 22:09.003
		Lemonis: AND SO YOU'LL

22:07.008 --> 22:09.003
ESSENTIALLY PULL AN ORDER,

22:09.005 --> 22:10.028
			PULL ALL THE PARTS,

22:09.005 --> 22:10.028
			TAKE IT THROUGH THE PROCESS,

22:11.000 --> 22:12.015
		1 THROUGH 10.

22:12.016 --> 22:15.002
	ONCE IT LEAVES, IT'S ON

22:12.016 --> 22:15.002
ITS WAY TO THE MONEY DOOR.

22:15.003 --> 22:16.011
		OKAY, SO, WE'RE GONNA

22:15.003 --> 22:16.011
			START CLEANING IT UP

22:16.012 --> 22:18.016
		AND GET READY FOR IT,

22:16.012 --> 22:18.016
ALL RIGHT?

22:20.001 --> 22:23.005
		YOU CAN PICK UP TIME,

22:20.001 --> 22:23.005
		WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME

22:23.006 --> 22:27.000
		AS PICKING UP MARGIN,

22:23.006 --> 22:27.000
		BY PUTTING A PROCESS IN PLACE

22:27.001 --> 22:30.000
		THAT CLEARLY ORGANIZES

22:27.001 --> 22:30.000
		THE INVENTORY.

22:30.000 --> 22:33.000
			THE SYSTEM WILL ALSO UPDATE

22:30.000 --> 22:33.000
THE STATUS OF EVERY ORDER

22:33.000 --> 22:35.013
	SO MIKE DOESN'T HAVE TO

22:33.000 --> 22:35.013
	BOTHER PEOPLE ABOUT IT.

22:37.019 --> 22:40.007
	WE'LL HANG THAT.

22:41.009 --> 22:43.009
			-[ LAUGHS ]

22:51.016 --> 22:53.009
			HOW ARE YOU?

22:53.009 --> 22:56.005
	-Scott: GOOD. HOW ARE YOU?

22:53.009 --> 22:56.005
	-Lemonis: YOU DOING ALL RIGHT?

22:56.006 --> 22:57.018
			I INVITED SCOTT HERE

22:57.019 --> 22:59.028
TO SEE IF HE'LL CONSIDER

22:57.019 --> 22:59.028
WORKING WITH SJC AGAIN.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.007
BUT IN ORDER FOR THAT TO HAPPEN,

23:00.000 --> 23:02.007
		HE AND MIKE

23:02.008 --> 23:04.013
ARE GONNA HAVE TO PATCH UP

23:02.008 --> 23:04.013
THEIR DIFFERENCES.

23:04.015 --> 23:08.017
	-IT FEEL WEIRD TO BE BACK HERE?

23:04.015 --> 23:08.017
	-Scott: IT DOES.

23:08.018 --> 23:11.011
			I SPENT A LOT OF DAYS HERE.

23:11.012 --> 23:13.007
		Lemonis: SCOTT HASN'T

23:11.012 --> 23:13.007
		SPOKEN TO HIS BROTHER

23:13.008 --> 23:15.017
			SINCE THEIR FALLOUT

23:13.008 --> 23:15.017
	NEARLY THREE YEARS AGO,

23:15.018 --> 23:17.028
			AND THERE IS

23:15.018 --> 23:17.028
			A LOT OF ANIMOSITY.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.018
		QUITE FRANKLY,

23:19.019 --> 23:21.011
	I'M NOT SURE THAT THEIR

23:19.019 --> 23:21.011
		RELATIONSHIP CAN BE REPAIRED.

23:21.012 --> 23:23.008
-WE'LL GO INSIDE.

23:21.012 --> 23:23.008
-Scott: SURE.

23:23.009 --> 23:25.000
	Lemonis:

23:23.009 --> 23:25.000
		LOOK AT THIS PICTURE.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.009
			Scott: YEAH.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.009
	I REMEMBER THAT.

23:27.009 --> 23:30.011
			IT KIND OF LOST ITS MEANING

23:27.009 --> 23:30.011
		AFTER A LITTLE WHILE.

23:43.015 --> 23:44.019
	Lemonis: [BLEEP]

23:44.019 --> 23:48.009
-THIS IS LIKE...

23:44.019 --> 23:48.009
-Scott: YEAH.

23:48.010 --> 23:50.005
	Lemonis: I'M WAITING FOR

23:48.010 --> 23:50.005
SOMEBODY TO SAY SOMETHING

23:50.006 --> 23:51.006
		OTHER THAN ME.

23:51.007 --> 23:54.006
Mike: THANK YOU

23:51.007 --> 23:54.006
FOR COMING HERE.

23:54.007 --> 23:57.017
		WE BUILT THE BUSINESS

23:54.007 --> 23:57.017
TOGETHER.

23:57.018 --> 23:59.019
			THERE WERE OBVIOUSLY

23:57.018 --> 23:59.019
		LOTS OF DISAGREEMENTS

23:59.019 --> 24:01.015
			AND THINGS THAT WERE

23:59.019 --> 24:01.015
		SAID AND DONE,

24:01.016 --> 24:06.018
AND WE BOTH PUT UP WITH

24:01.016 --> 24:06.018
DISAPPOINTMENT AND CRAP.

24:06.019 --> 24:09.007
Scott: WHAT DISAPPOINTMENT

24:06.019 --> 24:09.007
	DID YOU GET PUT UP WITH?

24:09.008 --> 24:11.002
Mike: SCOTT, WE COULD GO

24:09.008 --> 24:11.002
BACK AND FORTH ALL DAY,

24:11.003 --> 24:13.009
		AND I'M NOT INTERESTED

24:11.003 --> 24:13.009
	IN GOING BACK AND FORTH.

24:13.010 --> 24:15.007
			I'M MORE INTERESTED

24:13.010 --> 24:15.007
	IN TRYING TO BE BROTHERS

24:15.008 --> 24:17.017
			THAN REHASH

24:15.008 --> 24:17.017
			A LOT OF THAT STUFF.

24:17.018 --> 24:19.018
		Scott:

24:17.018 --> 24:19.018
WHAT DID I EVER DO TO YOU?

24:23.019 --> 24:25.015
		SAY -- WHAT DID I EVER

24:23.019 --> 24:25.015
DO TO YOU?

24:25.016 --> 24:27.019
	Mike: I REALLY

24:25.016 --> 24:27.019
DON'T WANT TO GET INTO ALL THAT.

24:27.019 --> 24:29.013
		Scott:

24:27.019 --> 24:29.013
	ALL I DID WAS WORK HARD.

24:29.015 --> 24:31.002
	Mike: ALL I DID

24:29.015 --> 24:31.002
			WAS WORK HARD, TOO.

24:31.003 --> 24:32.009
			Scott: NO, ALL YOU DIDN'T DO

24:31.003 --> 24:32.009
		WAS WORK HARD.

24:32.010 --> 24:34.003
	YOU WORKED HARD,

24:32.010 --> 24:34.003
	AND YOU FORMED A MUTINY,

24:34.005 --> 24:35.015
	AND YOU

24:34.005 --> 24:35.015
TURNED PEOPLE AGAINST ME.

24:35.016 --> 24:38.000
		Mike: FOR A LONG TIME,

24:38.001 --> 24:40.013
			SCOTT FELT LIKE THERE WAS

24:38.001 --> 24:40.013
			A MUTINY AGAINST HIM HERE.

24:40.015 --> 24:44.013
	I THINK IT WAS MORE HE WAS JUST

24:40.015 --> 24:44.013
			GANGED UP ON THAN A MUTINY.

24:44.015 --> 24:46.012
YOU KNOW, NOBODY WAS HERE

24:44.015 --> 24:46.012
	PLOTTING TO GET HIM OUT.

24:46.013 --> 24:48.019
		IT WAS JUST, YOU KNOW,

24:46.013 --> 24:48.019
	PEOPLE WOULD DISAGREE WITH HIM,

24:48.019 --> 24:51.001
		AND PEOPLE WOULD VENT.

24:48.019 --> 24:51.001
	SO I FEEL LIKE SCOTT WAS

24:51.002 --> 24:53.001
		A LITTLE BIT PARANOID

24:51.002 --> 24:53.001
			ABOUT THAT.

24:53.002 --> 24:55.001
	I WAS ACCUSED OF FORMING

24:53.002 --> 24:55.001
		A MUTINY AND ALL THESE THINGS,

24:55.002 --> 24:56.028
AND I APOLOGIZED FOR THAT.

24:56.028 --> 24:59.007
Scott: YOU WEREN'T ACCUSED

24:56.028 --> 24:59.007
			OF IT. YOU -- YOU DID DO IT.

24:59.008 --> 25:01.006
	Mike: OKAY, THAT'S FINE.

24:59.008 --> 25:01.006
AND AGAIN, I UNDERSTAND --

25:01.007 --> 25:03.000
Scott: SO, WHY AM I WRONG

25:01.007 --> 25:03.000
FOR SAYING A FACT?

25:03.001 --> 25:04.017
Mike: I UNDERSTAND

25:03.001 --> 25:04.017
	THAT YOU FEEL THAT WAY,

25:04.018 --> 25:06.009
AND I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT.

25:06.010 --> 25:08.007
			I APOLOGIZE

25:06.010 --> 25:08.007
FOR THE WAY THAT YOU FEEL

25:08.008 --> 25:09.019
	ABOUT THOSE CERTAIN SITUATIONS.

25:09.019 --> 25:11.011
		Scott: BUT YOU CAME UP

25:09.019 --> 25:11.011
WITH THAT CULTURE.

25:11.012 --> 25:13.015
		-Lemonis: HE KNOWS THAT.

25:11.012 --> 25:13.015
		-Scott: AND YOU FOSTERED IT.

25:13.016 --> 25:16.028
		AND, YOU KNOW,

25:13.016 --> 25:16.028
		IT WAS NEVER MY IDEA TO LEAVE.

25:17.000 --> 25:20.001
			IT WAS -- I NEVER WAS LIKE,

25:17.000 --> 25:20.001
"I WANT OUT. I'M LEAVING."

25:20.002 --> 25:23.007
	YOU WERE THE ONE

25:20.002 --> 25:23.007
WHO INITIATED ME LEAVING.

25:23.008 --> 25:27.001
			SO, THAT --

25:23.008 --> 25:27.001
ON TOP OF EVERYTHING ELSE,

25:27.002 --> 25:30.007
		THAT WAS LIKE,

25:27.002 --> 25:30.007
			"ALL RIGHT, I'M NOT WANTED.

25:30.008 --> 25:32.000
		[BLEEP] IT. I'M GONE."

25:35.013 --> 25:37.009
	Lemonis:

25:35.013 --> 25:37.009
	IS THERE EVER ANY MOMENT

25:37.010 --> 25:39.005
			THAT IS NOT

25:37.010 --> 25:39.005
THIS BACK-AND-FORTH STUFF

25:39.006 --> 25:40.019
		WHERE YOU GUYS

25:39.006 --> 25:40.019
CAN GET PAST THIS,

25:40.020 --> 25:43.000
		OR DO YOU FEEL

25:40.020 --> 25:43.000
			LIKE IT'S JUST NOT FIXABLE?

25:43.001 --> 25:44.016
Scott: IN TERMS OF

25:43.001 --> 25:44.016
	A PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP,

25:44.017 --> 25:46.008
			I JUST THINK

25:44.017 --> 25:46.008
			NOW'S NOT THE TIME.

25:46.009 --> 25:48.009
			Lemonis: OKAY, SO WE'LL STOP

25:46.009 --> 25:48.009
	TALKING ABOUT PERSONAL.

25:48.010 --> 25:50.015
	DO YOU FEEL LIKE

25:48.010 --> 25:50.015
			THIS COMPANY HAS POTENTIAL?

25:50.016 --> 25:52.018
			-Scott: YES.

25:50.016 --> 25:52.018
			-Mike: YEAH.

25:52.019 --> 25:56.000
	Lemonis:

25:52.019 --> 25:56.000
			ALL RIGHT, DO YOU FEEL LIKE

25:52.019 --> 25:56.000
WE MAKE A GOOD DRUM HERE?

25:56.001 --> 25:59.009
		ALL RIGHT. SO,

25:56.001 --> 25:59.009
		WE HAVE SOME THINGS IN COMMON.

25:59.009 --> 26:00.028
	LET'S TALK ABOUT DRUMS.

26:00.028 --> 26:03.028
Scott: MY IDEAS, I THINK,

26:00.028 --> 26:03.028
		WILL BE BETTER SUITED

26:03.028 --> 26:06.007
TO PUT INTO PLAY IF I SEE

26:03.028 --> 26:06.007
WHAT THINGS ARE RIGHT NOW.

26:06.008 --> 26:08.012
	Lemonis: LET'S GO DO IT.

26:08.013 --> 26:11.006
-Mike: THANKS FOR COMING.

26:08.013 --> 26:11.006
-Scott: YOU'RE WELCOME.

26:20.016 --> 26:22.011
			Mike: DUDE, I CAN'T [BLEEP]

26:20.016 --> 26:22.011
			HANDLE THIS [BLEEP]

26:22.012 --> 26:24.007
	WE'VE TALKED ABOUT BRINGING HIM

26:22.012 --> 26:24.007
		BACK IN THE BUSINESS,

26:24.008 --> 26:27.011
	AND MARCUS WANTS

26:24.008 --> 26:27.011
HIM BACK IN THE BUSINESS,

26:27.012 --> 26:29.017
	BUT IF WE CAN'T EVEN BE

26:27.012 --> 26:29.017
IN THE SAME ROOM TOGETHER

26:29.018 --> 26:31.017
	BECAUSE YOU CAN [BLEEP]

26:29.018 --> 26:31.017
		CUT THE TENSION WITH A KNIFE,

26:31.018 --> 26:33.016
			THEN I'M NOT GONNA BE HERE.

26:43.005 --> 26:45.016
THEN THROWING THAT

26:43.005 --> 26:45.016
		ON TOP OF IT.

26:45.017 --> 26:46.027
		[ SNIFFLING ]

26:53.000 --> 26:58.005
			I WOULD RATHER JUST

26:53.000 --> 26:58.005
	[BLEEP] CHECK OUT, DUDE.

26:58.006 --> 27:00.026
I CAN'T TAKE THIS.

27:00.027 --> 27:02.026
		-Lemonis: WHAT PART?

27:00.027 --> 27:02.026
		-Mike: ALL OF IT.

27:02.027 --> 27:04.005
			I UNDERSTAND

27:02.027 --> 27:04.005
			WHAT YOU'RE SAYING,

27:04.006 --> 27:06.003
	AND I UNDERSTAND

27:04.006 --> 27:06.003
WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM.

27:06.005 --> 27:09.016
I'M ONLY HUMAN.

27:06.005 --> 27:09.016
I'M NOT A ROBOT.

27:09.017 --> 27:11.000
Lemonis: I DIDN'T ASK YOU

27:09.017 --> 27:11.000
			TO BE LIKE A ROBOT.

27:11.001 --> 27:12.017
HE DOESN'T WANT TO

27:11.001 --> 27:12.017
		HEAR YOU SAY,

27:12.018 --> 27:15.023
"I'M SORRY THAT YOU FEEL

27:12.018 --> 27:15.023
LIKE I PUSHED YOU OUT."

27:15.025 --> 27:17.019
			IT'S VERY DIFFERENT

27:15.025 --> 27:17.019
			THAN SAYING,

27:17.020 --> 27:19.026
	"I'M SORRY THAT YOU GOT

27:17.020 --> 27:19.026
			PUSHED OUT OF HERE."

27:19.027 --> 27:21.019
			IT'S VERY DIFFERENT.

27:21.020 --> 27:23.000
Mike: I UNDERSTAND

27:21.020 --> 27:23.000
			WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

27:23.001 --> 27:24.007
	Lemonis:

27:23.001 --> 27:24.007
		OKAY, THEN GO FIX IT.

27:24.008 --> 27:26.022
	I AM NOT OPRAH.

27:26.023 --> 27:29.017
TO THINK THAT YOUR BROTHER

27:26.023 --> 27:29.017
		DOESN'T ADD SOME VALUE

27:29.018 --> 27:31.019
			IS [BLEEP] ASININE.

27:31.020 --> 27:33.028
			I THINK HE CAN ADD SOMETHING

27:31.020 --> 27:33.028
	TO THE BUSINESS.

27:42.017 --> 27:44.000
			Scott: THIS ISN'T A MACHINE

27:42.017 --> 27:44.000
			FROM WILLY WONKA'S FACTORY.

27:44.001 --> 27:46.015
THIS IS, LIKE, YOU KNOW --

27:46.016 --> 27:47.028
THIS IS --

27:46.016 --> 27:47.028
		THIS IS THE REAL DEAL.

27:47.028 --> 27:49.008
THIS IS, LIKE, YOU KNOW...

27:49.009 --> 27:51.021
			Mike: DO YOU MIND

27:49.009 --> 27:51.021
			TALKING OVER HERE?

27:51.022 --> 27:54.019
	Scott: I-I MEAN, IF YOU

27:51.022 --> 27:54.019
		WANT TO TALK, I'LL -- I'LL...

27:54.019 --> 27:57.001
I'LL -- YEAH, WE CAN TALK.

27:57.002 --> 28:01.000
Mike: THAT WAS NOT THE WAY

27:57.002 --> 28:01.000
	THAT I WANTED IT TO GO.

28:01.000 --> 28:04.026
I WANTED TO COME IN HERE AND SAY

28:01.000 --> 28:04.026
			I AM SORRY, TRULY,

28:04.027 --> 28:08.017
THAT I DID NOT DEFEND YOU

28:04.027 --> 28:08.017
			WHEN THE [BLEEP] HIT THE FAN

28:08.018 --> 28:10.001
	AND STUFF HAPPENED HERE.

28:10.002 --> 28:12.006
	THE CULTURE WAS,

28:10.002 --> 28:12.006
	YEAH, SOMETHING THAT I CREATED.

28:12.007 --> 28:14.023
	AND I WAS DOING

28:12.007 --> 28:14.023
WHAT I THOUGHT WAS RIGHT,

28:14.025 --> 28:16.016
AND I DIDN'T KNOW

28:14.025 --> 28:16.016
		WHAT THE [BLEEP] I WAS DOING.

28:16.017 --> 28:18.003
		Scott:

28:16.017 --> 28:18.003
YOU THOUGHT WHAT WAS RIGHT

28:18.005 --> 28:20.019
WAS TO DEFEND THEM AND --

28:18.005 --> 28:20.019
		AND TREAT ME LIKE AN OUTCAST?

28:20.020 --> 28:22.019
	Mike: I NEVER THOUGHT

28:20.020 --> 28:22.019
	THAT WAS RIGHT, SCOTT.

28:22.019 --> 28:24.027
Scott: PEOPLE HAD THE WRONG IDEA

28:22.019 --> 28:24.027
ABOUT ME BECAUSE OF YOU.

28:24.028 --> 28:27.002
		-Mike: OKAY.

28:24.028 --> 28:27.002
		-Scott: AND THAT'S --

28:27.003 --> 28:29.000
LIKE, THAT'S -- THAT'S TERRIBLE.

28:31.007 --> 28:34.021
		Mike:

28:31.007 --> 28:34.021
			I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT, SCOTT.

28:34.022 --> 28:37.021
IT -- THINGS GET BLOWN UP.

28:34.022 --> 28:37.021
	THINGS BLEW UP.

28:37.022 --> 28:39.022
	I NEVER INTENTIONALLY --

28:39.023 --> 28:41.017
		Scott: YOU DID

28:39.023 --> 28:41.017
		INTENTIONALLY TURN --

28:41.018 --> 28:42.028
		Mike:

28:41.018 --> 28:42.028
		I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT.

28:42.028 --> 28:44.002
			Scott: YOU JUST SAID

28:42.028 --> 28:44.002
	YOU DIDN'T, BUT YOU DID.

28:44.003 --> 28:46.015
-SAY YOU DID.

28:44.003 --> 28:46.015
-Mike: I DID IT.

28:46.016 --> 28:50.016
	AND I'M SORRY FOR THAT.

28:50.017 --> 28:51.026
	AND I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE

28:51.027 --> 28:53.005
	A RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU

28:51.027 --> 28:53.005
			AS BROTHERS.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.025
			Scott: WELL,

28:58.000 --> 28:59.025
	RIGHT NOW FOR ME

28:59.026 --> 29:02.019
		IS NOT THE TIME TO WANT TO SIT

28:59.026 --> 29:02.019
		AND TALK ABOUT BROTHER THINGS.

29:02.020 --> 29:04.005
		Mike:

29:02.020 --> 29:04.005
	WELL, JUST SO YOU KNOW,

29:04.006 --> 29:05.020
I AM INTERESTED

29:04.006 --> 29:05.020
IN TALKING ABOUT BROTHER THINGS,

35:47.018 --> 35:50.018
		WE BOUGHT OVER

35:47.018 --> 35:50.018
	$50,000 OF NEW EQUIPMENT

35:50.018 --> 35:52.014
TO IMPROVE THEIR PROCESS,

35:52.016 --> 35:55.010
INCLUDING

35:52.016 --> 35:55.010
		TWO NEW DRILL PRESSES,

35:55.012 --> 35:57.005
			A TABLE SAW,

35:57.005 --> 35:58.021
		FOUR DOWNDRAFT TABLES

35:57.005 --> 35:58.021
FOR DUST,

35:58.023 --> 36:00.014
AND A NEW

35:58.023 --> 36:00.014
	AIR-PURIFICATION SYSTEM.

36:00.016 --> 36:03.010
THIS PLACE

36:00.016 --> 36:03.010
LOOKS SPECTACULAR.

36:03.010 --> 36:06.005
		I MEAN, IT LOOKS KIND OF LIKE

36:03.010 --> 36:06.005
			WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT, RIGHT?

36:06.005 --> 36:08.003
			IN THE PAST,

36:06.005 --> 36:08.003
SJC COULDN'T MAKE

36:08.003 --> 36:10.007
MORE THAN

36:08.003 --> 36:10.007
40 KITS IN A GIVEN MONTH.

36:10.007 --> 36:13.005
	NOW SJC CAN MAKE

36:10.007 --> 36:13.005
		OVER 100 KITS A MONTH,

36:13.007 --> 36:16.003
		GIVING THE OPPORTUNITY

36:13.007 --> 36:16.003
FOR A CUSTOMER TO ORDER IT

36:16.003 --> 36:18.009
			AND FOR THEM

36:16.003 --> 36:18.009
			TO ACTUALLY GET IT QUICKLY.

36:18.010 --> 36:22.010
	AND NOW THAT PARTS ARE IN STOCK

36:18.010 --> 36:22.010
	AND THERE'S A PROCESS IN PLACE,

36:22.012 --> 36:25.010
		THERE'S ZERO LEAD TIME INSTEAD

36:22.012 --> 36:25.010
	OF THE EIGHT-MONTH WAIT.

36:25.012 --> 36:26.023
	IT FEELS LIKE A LEGIT BUSINESS.

36:26.025 --> 36:28.016
			Chris: YEAH,

36:26.025 --> 36:28.016
		IT'S DEFINITELY GETTING THERE.

36:28.018 --> 36:30.012
			I FEEL LIKE WE CAN EVEN GET

36:28.018 --> 36:30.012
			BETTER AND BETTER AS WE GO.

36:30.014 --> 36:31.023
	Lemonis:

36:30.014 --> 36:31.023
		CHRIS DID A GREAT JOB

36:31.023 --> 36:33.023
OF GETTING

36:31.023 --> 36:33.023
	THE 10 STEPS INSTALLED,

36:33.023 --> 36:36.021
		BUT HE DID AN EVEN BETTER JOB

36:33.023 --> 36:36.021
		OF GETTING THE PROTOTYPE MADE

36:36.021 --> 36:39.001
AT THE COST THAT I WANTED.

36:39.001 --> 36:41.019
			I KNEW MAKING HIM A PARTNER

36:39.001 --> 36:41.019
		WOULD PAY OFF.

36:41.021 --> 36:43.014
	AND IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE

36:41.021 --> 36:43.014
	I'M IN A BIG DUST BOWL ANYMORE.

36:43.014 --> 36:45.003
	-Mike: RIGHT.

36:43.014 --> 36:45.003
	-Chris: RIGHT.

36:45.003 --> 36:46.012
		Lemonis: NOW THAT THE 10 STEPS

36:45.003 --> 36:46.012
		ARE IN PLACE,

36:46.014 --> 36:49.001
WE CAN BUILD A NEW

36:46.014 --> 36:49.001
		"BETTER" LINE,

36:49.003 --> 36:52.016
	THE INTERMEDIATE KIT,

36:49.003 --> 36:52.016
IN LESS TIME, MAKING MORE MONEY.

36:52.018 --> 36:54.016
			OUR NEW "BETTER" KIT

36:52.018 --> 36:54.016
		WILL BE THE FIRST DRUM

36:54.018 --> 36:57.005
		TO GO THROUGH

36:54.018 --> 36:57.005
	THE NEW 10-STEP PROCESS.

36:57.005 --> 36:59.021
		FROM CUTTING THE TUBE,

36:57.005 --> 36:59.021
TO SANDING, TO PAINTING,,

36:59.021 --> 37:02.018
	IT WILL MOVE FORWARD TO EDGING.

37:02.018 --> 37:06.012
		NEXT, IT GOES THROUGH LAYOUT,

37:02.018 --> 37:06.012
	DRILLING, AND ASSEMBLY.

37:06.012 --> 37:09.012
			AND FINALLY,

37:06.012 --> 37:09.012
	A QUALITY CHECK.

37:09.014 --> 37:11.003
			THE NEW KITS

37:11.003 --> 37:14.005
	GO THROUGH SUCCESS STEPS

37:11.003 --> 37:14.005
			1 THROUGH 10 IN RECORD TIME,

37:14.005 --> 37:17.019
ALLOWING US TO MAKE DRUMS

37:14.005 --> 37:17.019
			IN DAYS, NOT MONTHS.

37:17.021 --> 37:19.005
		I FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT.

37:17.021 --> 37:19.005
			I REALLY DO.

37:19.007 --> 37:20.010
		Chris:

37:19.007 --> 37:20.010
			FEELS A LOT CLEANER.

37:29.023 --> 37:31.010
			Lemonis: HEY, GUYS.

37:31.012 --> 37:33.005
		-HOW ARE YOU?

37:31.012 --> 37:33.005
		-Mike: HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

37:33.007 --> 37:36.012
Lemonis: SJC DRUMS NOW HAS

37:33.007 --> 37:36.012
THREE TYPES OF PRODUCTS --

37:36.012 --> 37:38.010
	GOOD, BETTER, AND BEST.

37:38.012 --> 37:41.016
	THE GOOD PRODUCT IS ONE

37:38.012 --> 37:41.016
THAT'S MADE FOR BEGINNERS.

37:41.016 --> 37:44.007
	THE BETTER KIT WAS MADE

37:41.016 --> 37:44.007
FOR INTERMEDIATE PLAYERS,

37:44.007 --> 37:46.016
			AND THE BEST PRODUCT

37:44.007 --> 37:46.016
IS THE CUSTOM KITS

37:46.018 --> 37:50.001
	THAT ALLOW CONSUMERS TO DESIGN

37:46.018 --> 37:50.001
IT EXACTLY THE WAY THEY WANT IT.

37:50.001 --> 37:52.012
	THIS IS FOR REAL PROFESSIONALS.

37:52.012 --> 37:55.021
	SO, I'VE BROUGHT MIKE AND CHRIS

37:52.012 --> 37:55.021
			TO NEW YORK CITY TO SAM ASH,

37:55.021 --> 37:58.014
			ONE OF THE NATION'S

37:55.021 --> 37:58.014
	LEADING MUSIC RETAILERS.

37:58.016 --> 38:00.001
	THEY'VE BEEN IN BUSINESS

38:00.003 --> 38:03.005
		OVER 90 YEARS

38:00.003 --> 38:03.005
	WITH OVER 50 LOCATIONS.

38:03.005 --> 38:04.016
WE'RE LOOKING FOR SAM ASH

38:04.016 --> 38:06.016
TO MARKET

38:04.016 --> 38:06.016
	OUR NEW "BETTER" LINE OF DRUMS.

38:08.007 --> 38:11.001
			WE KNOW SJC NEEDS A RETAILER

38:08.007 --> 38:11.001
TO GET TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

38:11.003 --> 38:13.016
			IT'S IMPORTANT TO ME

38:11.003 --> 38:13.016
		THAT MIKE DO A GOOD JOB TODAY.

38:13.016 --> 38:16.014
	I'VE HEARD HE'S A GREAT

38:13.016 --> 38:16.014
	SALESMAN, BUT I WANT TO SEE IT.

38:16.016 --> 38:18.012
			THIS COMPANY

38:16.016 --> 38:18.012
			NEEDS THIS ACCOUNT.

38:18.012 --> 38:20.003
	-Richard: HI. WE'VE NEVER MET.

38:18.012 --> 38:20.003
	-Mike: I'M MIKE.

38:20.003 --> 38:21.014
	Richard:

38:20.003 --> 38:21.014
			MIKE, HOW YOU DOING?

38:21.016 --> 38:22.021
		Lemonis: HOW ARE YOU?

38:21.016 --> 38:22.021
			I'M MARCUS.

38:22.023 --> 38:24.005
NICE TO MEET YOU.

38:24.007 --> 38:26.003
Mike: COOL, YEAH,

38:24.007 --> 38:26.003
			SO MY BROTHER AND I

38:26.003 --> 38:27.021
	STARTED THE COMPANY OUT

38:26.003 --> 38:27.021
		OF OUR GRANDMOTHER'S BASEMENT

38:27.023 --> 38:29.007
IN DUDLEY, MASSACHUSETTS.

38:29.009 --> 38:31.007
	SJC IS ACTUALLY

38:29.009 --> 38:31.007
		MY BROTHER'S INITIALS.

38:31.009 --> 38:32.025
		RIGHT NOW WHAT WE'RE DOING IS,

38:32.027 --> 38:34.023
		INSTEAD OF JUST BEING

38:32.027 --> 38:34.023
A FULL-FLEDGED CUSTOM SHOP

38:34.023 --> 38:37.014
	LIKE WE'VE DONE IN THE PAST, WE

38:34.023 --> 38:37.014
	ARE DEVELOPING A PRODUCT MIX --

38:37.014 --> 38:40.003
		A GOOD, BETTER, BEST MODEL --

38:37.014 --> 38:40.003
		WHERE WE'D LOVE TO HAVE THIS,

38:40.005 --> 38:42.018
WHICH IS THE "BETTER" KIT,

38:40.005 --> 38:42.018
	AVAILABLE IN YOUR STORE.

38:42.019 --> 38:45.005
Richard: OH, BOY.

38:47.005 --> 38:48.021
			PRICE-WISE,

38:47.005 --> 38:48.021
		WHERE ARE YOU?

38:48.023 --> 38:51.014
			Mike: THIS KIT, TO SAM ASH,

38:48.023 --> 38:51.014
		WOULD BE ABOUT $1,100,

38:51.016 --> 38:54.010
			WHERE YOU GUYS COULD RETAIL

38:51.016 --> 38:54.010
			IT AT ABOUT $1,700.

38:54.010 --> 38:56.019
	Richard:

38:54.010 --> 38:56.019
	THAT'S -- NO, I'M SORRY.

38:58.003 --> 39:01.001
		YOU'VE PICKED

38:58.003 --> 39:01.001
A VERY DIFFICULT CATEGORY.

39:01.003 --> 39:02.021
		YOU'RE COMPETING WITH

39:01.003 --> 39:02.021
		SOME OF THE BIGGEST COMPANIES

39:02.021 --> 39:06.001
	IN THE INDUSTRY THAT HAVE HUGE,

39:02.021 --> 39:06.001
			HUGE ARTIST ROSTERS,

39:06.003 --> 39:08.007
	THAT HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR MANY,

39:06.003 --> 39:08.007
			MANY YEARS.

39:08.007 --> 39:10.003
IT'S JUST NOT WHAT WE SEE.

39:17.010 --> 39:19.005
HUGE ARTIST ROSTERS,

39:19.005 --> 39:21.000
	THAT HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR MANY,

39:19.005 --> 39:21.000
			MANY YEARS.

39:21.001 --> 39:23.001
IT'S JUST NOT WHAT WE SEE.

39:23.001 --> 39:26.000
Mike: OUR PRODUCT

39:23.001 --> 39:26.000
			IS STILL MADE IN THE U.S.A.

39:26.001 --> 39:27.025
		FOR THE QUALITY AND --

39:27.025 --> 39:29.007
Richard: AND THAT'S A VERY

39:27.025 --> 39:29.007
	IMPORTANT PART OF THE COMPONENT

39:29.007 --> 39:30.021
OF BEING A SUCCESS

39:29.007 --> 39:30.021
		IN THE DRUM BUSINESS,

39:30.023 --> 39:32.001
		IS U.S. MANUFACTURING.

39:32.003 --> 39:33.010
IT'S A GREAT PLACE TO COME FROM.

39:33.012 --> 39:35.001
WHEN A KID GETS DOWN HERE

39:35.001 --> 39:36.025
		AND HE'S GOT ALL THESE BRANDS

39:35.001 --> 39:36.025
	TO CHOOSE FROM,

39:36.027 --> 39:39.023
		YOU WANT US TO SAY, "BUT WHAT

39:36.027 --> 39:39.023
			YOU REALLY WANT IS THE SJC."

39:39.023 --> 39:40.025
			WHY?

39:40.027 --> 39:42.001
		Mike:

39:40.027 --> 39:42.001
I THINK THE BACKSTORY OF,

39:42.001 --> 39:43.023
YOU KNOW,

39:42.001 --> 39:43.023
OUR ARTISTS THAT WE HAVE.

39:43.023 --> 39:45.023
		WHY DOES TRÃ© COOL CHOOSE SJC?

39:45.023 --> 39:48.023
		SLIPKNOT USED TO PLAY PEARL.

39:45.023 --> 39:48.023
		NOW SLIPKNOT'S PLAYING SJC.

39:48.025 --> 39:50.012
		I'VE GONE ON TOUR WITH BANDS,

39:50.014 --> 39:51.023
			WHETHER IT'S IMAGINE DRAGONS

39:50.014 --> 39:51.023
OR SLIPKNOT OR GREEN DAY.

39:51.025 --> 39:53.023
		WHOEVER IT IS,

39:51.025 --> 39:53.023
		WE COULD PARLAY THAT,

39:53.025 --> 39:56.007
		HAVE THE BAND COME IN

39:53.025 --> 39:56.007
FOR KIDS TO MEET THE BAND.

39:56.007 --> 39:58.009
Richard: SO YOU COULD GET

39:56.007 --> 39:58.009
	GREEN DAY TO PLAY IN OUR STORE?

39:58.010 --> 39:59.027
	Mike: HIM AND I

39:58.010 --> 39:59.027
ARE GREAT FRIENDS.

39:59.027 --> 40:01.007
I'VE BEEN TO HIS WEDDING.

39:59.027 --> 40:01.007
		HE CAME TO MY WEDDING.

40:01.007 --> 40:03.003
		Richard: WOW.

40:01.007 --> 40:03.003
THAT IS VERY COOL.

40:03.003 --> 40:05.001
			WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

40:03.003 --> 40:05.001
IT'S VERY EXCITING

40:05.003 --> 40:07.012
			BECAUSE ALL THESE COMPANIES

40:05.003 --> 40:07.012
THAT ARE REPRESENTED HERE

40:07.012 --> 40:12.000
	ARE HUGE, MULTINATIONAL,

40:07.012 --> 40:12.000
		CORPORATE JUGGERNAUTS,

40:12.001 --> 40:14.005
		SO IT WOULD BE

40:12.001 --> 40:14.005
A PLEASURE FOR US

40:14.005 --> 40:17.010
		TO HELP SOMEBODY LIKE YOURSELF

40:14.005 --> 40:17.010
	SPREAD THE WORD.

40:17.010 --> 40:19.007
-WE'D LOVE TO DO IT.

40:17.010 --> 40:19.007
-Mike: THANK YOU SO MUCH.

40:19.007 --> 40:20.025
Richard: NOT EASY,

40:19.007 --> 40:20.025
		BUT EXCITING.

40:20.025 --> 40:23.001
			-YOU DID GOOD, KID.

40:20.025 --> 40:23.001
			-Mike: THANKS.

40:23.003 --> 40:24.003
	Richard:

40:23.003 --> 40:24.003
	YOU SOLD US SOME DRUMS.

40:24.005 --> 40:27.005
	Mike: [ LAUGHS ]

40:31.010 --> 40:33.005
		Lemonis: THINGS AT SJC

40:33.005 --> 40:36.023
		SEEM TO BE BETTER THAN

40:33.005 --> 40:36.023
			THEY'VE BEEN IN A LONG TIME.

40:36.023 --> 40:38.010
	THE PROCESS IS WORKING,

40:38.012 --> 40:40.001
		AND THE BUSINESS HAS RAMPED UP

40:38.012 --> 40:40.001
		REALLY NICELY.

40:40.003 --> 40:41.012
	ON AN ANNUALIZED BASIS,

40:41.012 --> 40:44.009
		WE COULD DO AS MUCH AS

40:41.012 --> 40:44.009
		$1.8 MILLION,

40:44.010 --> 40:46.010
		ALMOST DOUBLING THE BUSINESS.

40:48.007 --> 40:50.023
I'M NOW IN THE PROCESS OF

40:48.007 --> 40:50.023
			FINALIZING A LICENSING DEAL

40:50.025 --> 40:52.009
	WITH THE SCHOOL OF ROCK.

40:52.010 --> 40:53.025
I THINK THE THING

40:52.010 --> 40:53.025
		THAT'S MOST EXCITING ABOUT IT

40:53.027 --> 40:55.007
	IS THAT NOT ONLY IS IT GONNA BE

40:55.007 --> 40:57.009
			THE BRAND OF

40:55.007 --> 40:57.009
		OUR ENTRY-LEVEL DRUM,

40:57.010 --> 41:00.023
			BUT A PORTION OF THE

40:57.010 --> 41:00.023
		PROCEEDS ARE GONNA GO

40:57.010 --> 41:00.023
		TOWARDS SCHOLARSHIPS,

41:00.023 --> 41:03.023
		ALLOWING MORE KIDS TO GO THERE

41:00.023 --> 41:03.023
AND LEARN AND ENJOY MUSIC.

41:05.023 --> 41:07.007
			[ LAUGHTER ]

41:11.009 --> 41:14.025
	[ MUSIC STOPS ]

41:11.009 --> 41:14.025
	[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

41:14.025 --> 41:16.009
		Girl:

41:14.025 --> 41:16.009
		IT'S VERY FUN TO PLAY.

41:16.010 --> 41:18.023
			SOUNDS REALLY NICE,

41:16.010 --> 41:18.023
AND IT'S SO NICE-LOOKING.

41:18.025 --> 41:19.025
		Mike: AWESOME.

41:19.025 --> 41:21.016
	Lemonis:

41:19.025 --> 41:21.016
		WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT

41:21.018 --> 41:24.010
IS THAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN

41:21.018 --> 41:24.010
			SCOTT AND MIKE IS HEALING.

41:24.010 --> 41:27.007
		WITH ALL THE NEW OPPORTUNITIES

41:24.010 --> 41:27.007
THAT EXIST FOR SJC

41:27.009 --> 41:29.007
AND THE FACT THAT

41:27.009 --> 41:29.007
THE BROTHERS' RELATIONSHIP

41:29.009 --> 41:32.005
		IS HEADED IN THE RIGHT

41:29.009 --> 41:32.005
	DIRECTION, MY PREDICTION

41:32.005 --> 41:34.021
		IS THAT THEY'RE GONNA BE DOING

41:32.005 --> 41:34.021
	A LOT OF WORK TOGETHER.

41:34.023 --> 41:36.021
			THINK THE WAREHOUSE

41:34.023 --> 41:36.021
		LOOKS BETTER?

41:36.023 --> 41:38.003
		Scott:

41:36.023 --> 41:38.003
		I DON'T HAVE TOOLS THAT NICE.

41:38.003 --> 41:39.025
			Lemonis: OH,

41:38.003 --> 41:39.025
			YOU'RE JEALOUS OF THE TOOLS?

41:39.025 --> 41:41.000
		Scott:

41:39.025 --> 41:41.000
YEAH, PRETTY MUCH.

41:41.001 --> 41:42.005
		Mike:

41:41.001 --> 41:42.005
		THEY ARE PRETTY SWEET.

41:42.007 --> 41:43.021
Lemonis: YOU SEE,

41:42.007 --> 41:43.021
LIFE AND BUSINESS

41:43.023 --> 41:45.012
ISN'T ALWAYS ABOUT

41:43.023 --> 41:45.012
	CALCULATORS AND DOLLARS.

41:45.012 --> 41:48.023
IF THE BUSINESS IS HEALTHY

41:45.012 --> 41:48.023
	AND THE PEOPLE ARE GOOD

41:48.023 --> 41:51.012
	AND THE PROCESS IS RIGHT

41:48.023 --> 41:51.012
			AND YOU HAVE A GOOD PRODUCT,

41:51.014 --> 41:53.003
YOU'LL MAKE MONEY.

41:53.005 --> 41:55.023
		BUT THE RELATIONSHIPS

41:53.005 --> 41:55.023
HAVE TO BE SOLID.

41:55.023 --> 41:58.012
AND IN THIS CASE,

41:55.023 --> 41:58.012
		I FEEL LIKE WE'RE ON OUR WAY.

41:58.014 --> 42:01.003
Mike: SERIOUSLY, I THINK

41:58.014 --> 42:01.003
THE GREATEST THING THAT

41:58.014 --> 42:01.003
I'M TAKING AWAY FROM THIS

42:01.005 --> 42:03.023
			ISN'T THE MONEY THAT MARCUS

42:01.005 --> 42:03.023
		IS GIVING THE COMPANY

42:03.025 --> 42:05.001
	OR THE FACT THAT

42:03.025 --> 42:05.001
WE HAVE INVENTORY.

42:05.001 --> 42:06.025
YOU KNOW,

42:05.001 --> 42:06.025
	I THINK THAT'S AWESOME,

42:06.027 --> 42:08.003
	BUT THE GREATEST THING,

42:06.027 --> 42:08.003
			I FEEL LIKE,

42:08.005 --> 42:10.012
	IS THE FACT THAT

42:08.005 --> 42:10.012
	WE ARE ACTUALLY TALKING,

42:10.012 --> 42:14.003
		AND I THINK IT'S AWESOME THAT

42:10.012 --> 42:14.003
			MARCUS OPENED UP THAT DOOR.

42:14.005 --> 42:15.027
			PRETTY MUCH FORCED THE DOOR,

42:14.005 --> 42:15.027
		BUT...

42:15.027 --> 42:19.003
Scott: SPEAKING HONESTLY,

42:15.027 --> 42:19.003
			LIKE, YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T --

42:19.003 --> 42:21.012
	I DIDN'T EXPECT TO COME IN HERE

42:19.003 --> 42:21.012
AND TALK TO MIKE,

42:21.014 --> 42:25.009
			SO YOU DID KIND OF FORCE IT

42:21.014 --> 42:25.009
		ON US, BUT IT WORKED,

42:25.010 --> 42:28.007
			AND IT'S DEFINITELY

42:25.010 --> 42:28.007
HELPED ME MOVE ON.

42:28.007 --> 42:29.025
	Lemonis: HOW ARE THINGS

42:28.007 --> 42:29.025
	BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU GUYS NOW

42:29.025 --> 42:30.025
			COMPARED TO BEFORE?

42:30.027 --> 42:32.021
		-BETTER?

42:30.027 --> 42:32.021
		-Scott: YEAH.

42:32.023 --> 42:34.010
		A LOT BETTER.

42:34.010 --> 42:37.023
		-Lemonis: I OWE YOU, MY MAN.

42:34.010 --> 42:37.023
		-Scott: I'M GRATEFUL.

42:37.023 --> 42:39.005
Lemonis: I APPRECIATE IT.

42:39.005 --> 42:40.025
	-Mike: THANKS.

42:39.005 --> 42:40.025
	-Scott: YOU'RE WELCOME.
