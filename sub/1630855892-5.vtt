And this all has to do
with the ghost of a dead kid.

when she gets here.

anything to worry about,

09:37.869 --> 09:38.870
do you?

09:39.579 --> 09:42.165
You know, I think Lucas
is straightforward.

09:43.541 --> 09:45.376
You, on the other hand,
have been convincing everyone

09:45.460 --> 09:47.754
for years, including Margot,
that you guys are just friends

09:47.837 --> 09:49.547

-There's dupe soup on my Chucks!
-[laughs]

10:11.110 --> 10:13.279
Okay, I really don't feel comfortable
with us calling it that.

10:13.363 --> 10:15.198
I mean, I wanted to call it "James' Jam,"

10:15.281 --> 10:16.783
but you vetoed that one, too.

10:16.866 --> 10:20.370
Okay, but dupe soup just sounds intimate.

10:21.871 --> 10:23.623
[Margot] And after all of that,

10:23.706 --> 10:25.583
she says that it's complicated.

10:25.667 --> 10:26.751
Like, yeah, Mom, I know.

10:26.835 --> 10:28.461
I'm the one who's actually
dealing with it.

10:28.545 --> 10:30.797
It's just always an obfuscation with her.

10:30.880 --> 10:32.715
-Obfuscation?
-Like, she goes away

10:32.799 --> 10:35.134
to Seattle, and she doesn't tell me why.

10:35.218 --> 10:39.013
Fine. And she never tells
me anything, fine.

10:39.097 --> 10:42.725
But now there are actual
haunted objects trying

10:42.809 --> 10:44.644
to ruin our lives and
she knows something about it,

10:44.727 --> 10:46.020
and she still won't talk to me.

10:46.104 --> 10:47.230
And that's just, that's just not fine.

10:47.313 --> 10:48.606
I'm done being fine for her.

10:48.690 --> 10:51.109
You don't, you don't have to be fine.

10:53.486 --> 10:55.488
It's just that, like,

10:55.572 --> 10:57.240
she could actually
come through for me right now,

10:57.323 --> 11:00.285
and she still just chooses not to.

11:02.203 --> 11:04.247
I feel like she started
being really distant

11:04.330 --> 11:06.332
after I started high school.

11:06.416 --> 11:09.878
Like, she was just
waiting for me to grow up

11:09.961 --> 11:11.546
so she could finally be free.

11:12.547 --> 11:14.632
Maybe she just, like, hates teenagers.

11:15.884 --> 11:17.468
Or me.

11:17.552 --> 11:19.387
That's, that's not possible.

11:23.182 --> 11:26.936
[clears throat] So is this
the way to James' house?

11:27.020 --> 11:29.480
Yeah, it's just, it's a way.

11:29.564 --> 11:31.357
It's the long way.

11:31.441 --> 11:33.860

show you something first.

11:46.539 --> 11:47.916
Really?

No. But it kinda sounded cooler
if I said it like that.

11:57.842 --> 12:01.846
So why is it that you took me here?

12:02.847 --> 12:04.766
I guess I just want you to know that like,

12:06.392 --> 12:08.478

12:08.561 --> 12:11.481

12:30.041 --> 12:32.585
and so smart.

-We just took the long way.
-Mm-hmm.

13:09.956 --> 13:11.374
Okay, well, this is your meeting.

13:11.457 --> 13:12.542
Yeah, what did your mom say?

13:12.625 --> 13:13.918
Nothing.

13:14.002 --> 13:15.628
Which I probably should have just texted,

13:15.712 --> 13:17.046
but we already had this planned, so...

13:17.130 --> 13:18.798
Hang on, wait. She really said nothing?

13:19.716 --> 13:22.760
Like, "Don't trust anyone",
and then nothing?

13:22.844 --> 13:24.512
Yeah, no, she gave me this excuse

13:24.595 --> 13:26.931

the wrong thing and then--

is a very stylish blouse

13:30.518 --> 13:32.020
and like made her tell you
what the hell's going on?

13:32.103 --> 13:33.563
She did say "yet",

13:33.646 --> 13:37.233
so maybe later, she'll tell us something.

13:37.316 --> 13:39.777
Guys, I don't know.
I'm sorry. This is just my mom.

13:39.861 --> 13:41.404
She's extremely good at disappointing me

13:41.487 --> 13:43.656
and never answering any of my questions.

13:43.740 --> 13:46.284
[Isabella] I understand.
I mean, my mom sucks, too.

13:46.367 --> 13:49.120
I've literally dreamt about
murdering her in her sleep.

13:51.164 --> 13:53.166

13:53.249 --> 13:54.584
I told you guys about that, right?

13:54.667 --> 13:55.960
[all] No.

13:56.044 --> 13:57.962
Yeah, you got some
serious rage inside you.

13:58.046 --> 13:59.047
I do, you know.

13:59.130 --> 14:01.132
And my therapist tells me the same thing.

14:01.215 --> 14:03.843
My mom is making me
see her friend, Elizabeth.

14:03.926 --> 14:05.595
Sounds ethical.

14:05.678 --> 14:06.929
Yeah, for sure.

14:07.013 --> 14:09.223
So what are we supposed to do?

14:09.307 --> 14:10.767
Just like, go to school?

what else can we do?

cis-het up in here.

23:14.459 --> 23:15.376
I promise you,

23:15.460 --> 23:17.253
my mom is not going to tell us anything.

23:17.337 --> 23:18.463
So this,

23:18.546 --> 23:20.381
this is the one chance to finally

23:20.465 --> 23:21.716
know the truth.

23:21.799 --> 23:23.301
[tense music]

23:23.384 --> 23:24.719
So I have to do this.

23:25.970 --> 23:27.055
I have to go back in.

23:36.606 --> 23:38.233
Whoa, wait, where's that?

23:39.233 --> 23:40.276
It's right here.

23:40.318 --> 23:43.321
[dramatic music]

23:49.661 --> 23:51.913
[young Sarah] Harold,
why did you wanna meet me here?

23:51.996 --> 23:54.332
I'm scared. I'm really scared.

23:54.415 --> 23:56.000
Scared of what?

23:56.876 --> 23:58.044
What's going on with you?

23:58.127 --> 24:00.380
I think someone's trying to hurt me.

24:00.463 --> 24:01.464
Hurt you?

24:02.048 --> 24:04.300
Uh, what does that mean?

24:04.384 --> 24:06.678
-Did someone threaten you?
-Yes.

24:08.054 --> 24:10.139
No, look, I can't explain.

24:11.724 --> 24:13.309
I gotta go. Okay?

24:14.310 --> 24:15.311
Ben's waiting for me.

24:15.395 --> 24:17.021
I'm sorry.

24:17.105 --> 24:18.314
We'll talk about this later.

24:18.398 --> 24:20.108
-Please.
-What are you doing, Harold?

24:20.191 --> 24:21.776
-Don't leave me.
-Let go of my arm!

24:21.859 --> 24:23.903
Sarah. Sarah!

24:23.987 --> 24:26.990
[tense music]

24:28.992 --> 24:30.618
You can't go either, Margot.

24:33.162 --> 24:34.998
I'm not gonna let you leave me.

24:36.332 --> 24:38.334
[spooky music]

24:39.585 --> 24:40.837
Come with me.

24:42.755 --> 24:44.382

-Margot, Margot.
-What's going on?

-[dramatic music]

25:11.117 --> 25:12.118
Hey.

25:13.411 --> 25:15.413
What are you doing here?

25:19.417 --> 25:20.585
I was, uh...

25:21.961 --> 25:23.671
I was visiting Nora.

25:23.755 --> 25:26.257
-[gentle music]
-Why were you visiting Nora?

25:30.470 --> 25:32.055
Yeah, we should probably talk.

25:38.728 --> 25:40.730
So you're sleeping with Nora?

25:45.068 --> 25:47.862
I mean, I was using vaguer language,

25:47.945 --> 25:50.531
but... yeah.

25:53.034 --> 25:57.246
I thought we were on a trial separation.

25:57.330 --> 25:58.748
We were.

25:59.457 --> 26:00.875
We are...

26:01.626 --> 26:02.460
separated.

26:02.543 --> 26:05.546
I thought we were gonna
at least have a talk

26:06.381 --> 26:07.465
before a verdict?

26:07.548 --> 26:10.259
I thought the separation was the verdict.

26:10.343 --> 26:12.261
-Really?
-Yes, Sarah,

26:12.345 --> 26:15.139
you left us months ago.

26:15.973 --> 26:18.559
I wanted you guys to come with me.

26:18.643 --> 26:20.395
If we had all just moved together,

26:20.478 --> 26:21.938
none of this would be happening.

26:22.021 --> 26:25.441
So, what, I would just leave my job

26:25.525 --> 26:28.236
and my pension and career,

26:28.319 --> 26:30.488
and we would just pull our child

26:30.571 --> 26:32.115
out of high school and away

26:32.198 --> 26:34.700
from all the friends that
she's known her whole life?

26:34.784 --> 26:35.785
Great plan.

26:35.868 --> 26:38.371
I told you that I needed to leave,

26:38.454 --> 26:39.831
that I couldn't stay here anymore.

26:39.914 --> 26:41.332
But you didn't tell me why!

26:41.415 --> 26:43.251
I can't tell you why!

26:51.425 --> 26:52.927
You won't tell me.

26:58.057 --> 27:01.144
Sarah, I hate that
this is happening like this.

27:02.520 --> 27:05.231
I love you, and
I'm always going to love you.

27:05.314 --> 27:08.776
But I don't see how
this is gonna work out.

27:09.610 --> 27:10.820
So this is over?

27:12.447 --> 27:13.489

28:07.335 --> 28:09.754
Ma'am, you can't be here.

28:09.837 --> 28:11.923
I'm sorry. I just have to
tell her something,

28:12.006 --> 28:13.090
and then I'll go.

28:19.764 --> 28:21.015
Listen to me, Nora.

28:22.433 --> 28:23.643
You're not unwell.

28:23.726 --> 28:25.770
They just want you to think you are.

28:25.853 --> 28:27.355
The medication they're giving you

28:27.438 --> 28:29.357
is for people who are seeing
things that aren't there.

28:29.440 --> 28:30.650
But that's not you.

28:31.692 --> 28:32.944
If you wanna get out of here,

28:33.027 --> 28:34.862
you have to stop taking the pills

28:34.946 --> 28:36.864
and stop talking crazy.

28:36.948 --> 28:38.366
They don't understand.

28:39.784 --> 28:41.035
They don't believe you.

28:42.119 --> 28:43.162
But I do.

28:44.747 --> 28:47.291
You're right. We need to protect our kids.

28:47.375 --> 28:49.293
-We'll figure this out.

What?

29:55.651 --> 29:57.695
Okay. Okay, wait.

29:59.572 --> 30:01.198
She told us we need to be
in the same place that connects

30:01.282 --> 30:02.867
