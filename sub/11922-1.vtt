<i>By the standards
of the Yucatén jungle,</i>

00:54.179 --> 00:58.559
<i>the female ruby-throated
hummingbird is a plain Jane.</i>

00:59.810 --> 01:02.404
<i>In the weeks
leading to her migration,</i>

01:02.479 --> 01:05.322
<i>she eats almost
continuously.</i>

01:05.524 --> 01:09.154
<i>To survive the journey, she
must double her body weight.</i>

01:12.823 --> 01:15.997
<i>The sooty shearvvater, on the
other hand, must lose weight</i>

01:16.076 --> 01:20.081
<i>before setting out on his first
migration from Tasmania.</i>

01:20.163 --> 01:23.793
<i>His goal, to shed
half his body weight.</i>

01:25.043 --> 01:26.841
<i>The North American programmer</i>

01:27.254 --> 01:30.849
<i>would be content to lose
just a few pounds.</i>

01:30.924 --> 01:33.052
<i>But the task is difficult.</i>

01:33.135 --> 01:35.979
<i>He has a demanding job,
a brutal schedule,</i>

01:36.054 --> 01:37.806
<i>precious little willpower,</i>

01:37.889 --> 01:41.109
<i>and an all-consuming

01:41.184 --> 01:43.232
Yo! Big bad Brad.
Mmm?

01:43.312 --> 01:44.609
What you
rocking out to, man?

01:44.688 --> 01:45.860
Um...

01:50.235 --> 01:52.033
<i>Clark's</i> nutcracker.

01:55.449 --> 01:58.703
<i>He is a birder.
A man obsessed.</i>

01:58.869 --> 02:00.587
Rock on.

02:00.662 --> 02:02.630
Rock on, Prasad.

02:03.206 --> 02:08.463
<i>Nothing in nature inspires
anything like his passion for birds.</i>

02:09.295 --> 02:12.675
<i>Not even the female

02:12.758 --> 02:15.102
<i>A-well-a, everybody's
heard about the bird</i>

02:15.177 --> 02:17.771
<i>Bird, bird, bird,

Hello?
<i>Brad?</i>

02:21.892 --> 02:24.896
Hey, Vicki?
Hi, I was just thinking about you

02:26.563 --> 02:29.817
Look, there's something
I've got to tell you.

02:29.900 --> 02:31.152
I'm getting
married again.

02:31.568 --> 02:33.286
<i>And we're
announcing it tonight</i>

02:33.362 --> 02:36.115
<i>and I didn't want you to
hear it from just somebody.</i>

02:37.240 --> 02:39.208
<i>Brad?
Are you still there?</i>

02:39.743 --> 02:42.587
Yeah. That is great.
Congratulations. I was just

02:42.663 --> 02:45.257
<i>taking it in.
That is good news. Thanks.</i>

02:45.332 --> 02:46.675
<i>I'm sorry,
I'm a little distracted.</i>

02:46.750 --> 02:51.051
Because I've got some pretty
huge news of my own, actually.

02:51.129 --> 02:52.756
I'm gonna do a Big Year.

02:52.839 --> 02:54.056
<i>Great!</i>

02:54.925 --> 02:56.598
Yeah.
What is that again?

02:56.677 --> 02:57.803
<i>What's a Big Year?</i>

03:00.222 --> 03:01.974
<i>Well into the 19th century,</i>

03:02.057 --> 03:04.059
<i>Americans celebrated
Christmas Day</i>

03:05.352 --> 03:08.071
<i>with contests to kill the
most birds in a single day.</i>

03:08.522 --> 03:12.493
<i>In 1900, Audubon Society
ornithologist Frank Chapman</i>

03:12.567 --> 03:15.787
<i>suggested Americans should
count them instead,</i>

03:15.862 --> 03:20.163
<i>leading eventually to the
creation of the Big Year,</i>

03:20.242 --> 03:23.246
<i>a competition to see the
greatest number of birds</i>

03:23.328 --> 03:25.956
<i>in North America
in a calendar year.</i>

03:26.039 --> 03:28.508
Whoa!

03:28.583 --> 03:33.635
<i>In 2003, New Jersey roofing
contractor Kenny Bostick's Big Year</i>

03:33.714 --> 03:38.311
<i>resulted in an astonishing
732 species,</i>

03:38.385 --> 03:41.229
<i>breaking Sandy Komito's
North American record.</i>

03:41.304 --> 03:44.979
<i>Many believe that
Bostick's record of 732</i>

03:45.058 --> 03:48.312
<i>would stand forever,
especially Mrs. Bostick.</i>

03:48.478 --> 03:50.230
A Big Year?

03:50.313 --> 03:53.237
Kenny, you promised me you were
never gonna do another Big Year.

03:53.316 --> 03:55.410
Jess, I'm just going out
to set the pace.

03:55.485 --> 03:57.487
I promise I'll be back
as soon as I'm sure

03:57.571 --> 03:59.869
there's no one out there
who can break my record.

04:00.323 --> 04:02.166
Your record.
What's the big deal?

04:02.242 --> 04:06.122
The big deal? Hey, "Lance
Armstrong, what's the big deal?"

04:06.204 --> 04:09.424
Or, hey, "Columbus, what's the big
deal with that whole New World thing?"

04:09.499 --> 04:12.594
Didn't you tell me that a Big Year
killed your marriage to Steph in '03?

04:12.836 --> 04:14.930
First of all, I was married
to Bridget in '03.

04:15.005 --> 04:17.474
Didn't you tell me that a Big Year
killed your marriage to Bridget?

04:17.548 --> 04:20.052
A contributing factor,
but, no, not the main reason.

04:20.135 --> 04:22.558
There were so many other
problems with that marriage.

04:22.679 --> 04:26.354
Kenny, I'm getting fertility treatments!
And you promised.

04:26.433 --> 04:28.435
You said you were gonna build
a new room for the baby.

04:28.518 --> 04:30.111
I know.
That was before <i>El Niño.</i>

04:30.187 --> 04:33.236
Now I'm really worried someone's
gonna try to beat 732.

04:33.899 --> 04:36.118
<i>The reigning
king is right to worry.</i>

04:36.193 --> 04:39.493
<i>Somebody is going to try
to be beat 732.</i>

04:40.155 --> 04:44.410
<i>But the programmer is not the
only challenger for the title.</i>

04:44.618 --> 04:46.086
<i>Two hundred miles north,</i>

04:46.161 --> 04:50.917
<i>another fanatical birder is also
making plans for a Big Year.</i>

04:50.999 --> 04:52.296
We're still nowhere
on the deal.

04:52.375 --> 04:54.343
Chemwall won't budge
on any key points.

04:54.419 --> 04:55.796
Mclntire used to work
for you.

04:55.879 --> 04:58.132
Maybe if you negotiated
with him directly...

04:58.215 --> 05:00.513
Sorry, guys.
January 1st, I'm outta here.

05:00.759 --> 05:02.181
Oh, right,
you're retiring again.

05:02.260 --> 05:03.307
Again.

05:04.554 --> 05:05.646
This time I mean it.

05:05.722 --> 05:07.770
Next year is all
about the birds.

05:07.849 --> 05:10.227
Edith's already in Colorado
setting up the new house.

05:10.310 --> 05:12.813
So live in the new house
and work from home.

05:13.063 --> 05:15.657
Use the jet.
I mean, it's your jet

05:15.732 --> 05:17.279
- It's your company!
- Forget the birds.

05:18.068 --> 05:20.070
You're big boys now.
You'll be fine without me.

05:20.320 --> 05:23.995
You realize, of course, that the phase after
retirement looks a little bit like this.

05:25.242 --> 05:28.496
<i>The CEO is
frustrated by the persistence</i>

05:28.578 --> 05:31.923
<i>of his migrating instinct
into late adulthood.</i>

05:32.582 --> 05:36.303
Am I nuts, Edith?
Maybe I should do my Big Year next year.

05:36.378 --> 05:37.504
It might make more sense.

05:38.255 --> 05:40.804
No. Go do it now, Stu.

05:40.882 --> 05:42.259
<i>Carpe annum!</i>

05:42.467 --> 05:44.561
Seize the...
Year.

05:45.595 --> 05:46.642
So that's it?

05:47.222 --> 05:48.895
Complete support?

05:49.266 --> 05:50.939
You're not even gonna
try and stop me?

05:52.018 --> 05:55.022
Stu, I love you, and I will miss
you dearly when you're away.

05:55.605 --> 05:58.700
But you have been dreaming about
this since you were a little boy,

05:58.775 --> 06:02.279
and I am not gonna stand between
you and your greatest passion.

06:04.447 --> 06:06.120
Not my greatest passion.

06:06.241 --> 06:10.667
Three, two, one!
Happy New Year!

06:10.745 --> 06:11.837
Hey.

06:13.540 --> 06:15.963
Excuse me! Excuse me,
excuse me, excuse me.

06:16.960 --> 06:18.758
I just want to make
a little toast to my folks.

06:18.920 --> 06:21.093
Hey, okay.

06:21.673 --> 06:23.141
To my dad,

06:23.216 --> 06:26.015
who proved today that he can
still kick my ass on skis.

06:26.428 --> 06:28.305
Hey, I let you win a few just
to keep you hanging around.

06:28.972 --> 06:31.395
My childhood in a nutshell,
ladies and gentlemen.

06:32.642 --> 06:36.943
And to my mom, who had the
vision and confidence

06:37.314 --> 06:39.316
to design a house with enough
room for grandchildren.

06:39.482 --> 06:40.483
Hear, hear.

06:40.567 --> 06:42.160
If you build it,
they will come.

06:42.485 --> 06:45.034
Yes, and in this case,

06:45.113 --> 06:46.660
sometime around
the middle of May.

06:48.116 --> 06:49.242
Yes! Rea“Y?

06:49.326 --> 06:51.328
That's why she was tossing
her cookies all month.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.288
You're not the only one
having a big year, Dad.

06:53.496 --> 06:55.749
Congratulations. Hey.

06:59.878 --> 07:03.382
<i>NARBA hot-line.

You ready?
To the bottom?

07:20.357 --> 07:22.200
You're on, old man.
We'll see about that.

07:22.275 --> 07:23.777
Edith, count us off.

07:23.860 --> 07:26.579
On your mark.
Get set. Go!

07:30.075 --> 07:32.043
You'd think they'd be
exhausted by now.

07:32.118 --> 07:35.167
They're men, dear.
If they ever stop competing, they die.

07:53.556 --> 07:56.435
<i>The reigning king

<i>Some have already fallen by
the wayside due to injury.</i>

08:04.901 --> 08:07.996
<i>While others have seen

08:08.071 --> 08:10.995
Dad! I got into Yale!

08:13.535 --> 08:17.836
<i>Still, the reigning king

<i>lurk around

08:24.754 --> 08:25.755
Bingo.

08:31.052 --> 08:33.475
What would you guys do
without me?

08:40.937 --> 08:41.938
You okay?

08:42.230 --> 08:43.777
Magpie!

Yay!

Spot something rare for me.

09:01.666 --> 09:03.134
You know I will.

09:29.235 --> 09:31.237
I have
some exciting news.

09:32.530 --> 09:35.625
I'm gonna be working
as a travel agent again.

09:35.700 --> 09:36.952
For who?

09:37.994 --> 09:39.291
For Brad.

09:40.121 --> 09:42.340
I'm handling his travel
for the next year.

09:42.499 --> 09:43.967
Travel? Travel where?

09:44.834 --> 09:47.257
I'm doing
a Big Year, Dad.

09:47.337 --> 09:50.932
Spending the year trying to see <i>as</i>
many different species of bird as I can.

09:53.676 --> 09:56.896
I've been dreaming about
this for a long time.

09:56.971 --> 09:58.268
This is my year.

09:59.682 --> 10:03.027
I've saved 5 grand and I'm
gonna need five more,

10:03.103 --> 10:08.610
and I was wondering if you'd
consider sponsoring me?

10:09.067 --> 10:10.364
Sponsoring you.

10:10.443 --> 10:12.070
I'd pay you back.
With interest.

10:13.530 --> 10:15.453
Think of it <i>as</i> an investment.
An investment.

10:16.407 --> 10:18.626
Yeah, sure.
Yeah, definitely.

10:19.494 --> 10:21.496
Yeah, it sounds like
a great investment.

10:21.704 --> 10:23.081
I just hope
word doesn't get out.

10:23.164 --> 10:24.962
All the neighbors will want
a piece of the action.

10:26.459 --> 10:28.257
You know what? Forget it.
I'm gonna do it myself, so...

10:28.336 --> 10:30.555
You're 36 years old!

10:30.880 --> 10:33.724
You quit grad school.
You quit your job at Dell.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.928
You quit your marriage.

10:36.010 --> 10:39.139
Sooner or later, you're gonna have to
actually do something with your life!

10:39.222 --> 10:41.020
This is what I'm doing!

10:41.099 --> 10:43.067
But I guess you got it
all figured out.

10:43.143 --> 10:45.817
That's why your whole life
has been nothing but bliss!

10:49.566 --> 10:51.113
Bill, Tower One's
good to go.

10:51.192 --> 10:52.660
I'll debug the rest
when I get back Monday.

10:52.777 --> 10:54.950
Yeah, that bird thing, right?
Yeah.

10:55.029 --> 10:58.124
Listen, I'll pay you time-and-a-half
to work this weekend and catch us up.

10:58.199 --> 11:00.622
That'd pay for a lot
of airfare, right?

11:00.702 --> 11:02.750
Thanks, Bill, but I'm already
getting a late start as it is.

11:03.288 --> 11:05.711
So, what do you win?
Is there prize money?

11:06.249 --> 11:09.093
No prize money, but the
birdseed endorsements are huge.

11:09.752 --> 11:11.425
Seriously?
No.

11:13.173 --> 11:14.891
Okay, so why
do you do it?

11:15.675 --> 11:18.224
It's kind of
hard to explain.

11:18.469 --> 11:21.894
You know what's hard
to explain? To them?

11:22.348 --> 11:26.649
A core meltdown of the new reactor that
irradiates the entire Atlantic coast.

11:26.978 --> 11:28.275
Okay. Shit.

11:28.563 --> 11:32.568
Double-time.
And that's unprecedented.

11:35.612 --> 11:38.035
Okay. But I am definitely
leaving on the 20th.

11:38.948 --> 11:42.327
<i>NARBA hot-line.

11:42.410 --> 11:43.627

<i>A Xantus's hummingbird has been seen in a

<i>The Xantus's

12:05.475 --> 12:07.477
How do you do, ma'am?
I was wondering if...

12:07.560 --> 12:09.233
The hummingbird's
out there now.

12:09.312 --> 12:10.780
Let me just get you
the key to the gate.

12:10.855 --> 12:11.902
Oh! Fantastic.

12:11.981 --> 12:16.157
I've been meaning to ask
one of you people,

12:16.236 --> 12:19.786
do you have to get a snapshot of the bird?
Is that a rule?

12:20.657 --> 12:23.661
No. Believe it or not, it's all on
the old-fashioned honor system.

12:25.495 --> 12:27.418
But you just have
to say you saw it?

12:27.830 --> 12:31.300
No. In fact, if you can recognize a bird
by its song, you just have to hear it.

12:31.501 --> 12:32.502
Oh.

12:33.586 --> 12:36.089
But I see everybody
with a camera.

12:36.172 --> 12:38.391
You really want a photograph
if it's a rare one,

12:38.466 --> 12:40.093
same as you would
the Taj Mahal.

12:40.176 --> 12:42.929
Oh! Stay on the path.

12:43.513 --> 12:44.890
I'll bring it right back.

12:52.146 --> 12:54.023
This is Stu.
Stu, it's Barry.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.654
I'm here with Jim

12:56.067 --> 13:00.447
<i>We just need a little help.

13:00.822 --> 13:02.745
Stu?

13:03.783 --> 13:04.875
<i>Goddamn it!</i>

13:04.951 --> 13:06.828

a little expert guidance.</i>

13:10.581 --> 13:12.299
<i>We have reached an impasse
with Chemwall.</i>

13:12.375 --> 13:13.547
They don't...
It's going south, Stu.

13:13.626 --> 13:16.345
They don't want to give up their
production facilities in Nevada.

13:16.421 --> 13:18.674
<i>Hold out.
Their R & D is prehistoric.</i>

13:18.923 --> 13:21.301
It's all about the real estate.
Look, I gotta go.

13:21.384 --> 13:22.852
I'm about to miss
a Code Five.

13:22.927 --> 13:24.179
No, no...

13:25.972 --> 13:28.441
What the hell's
he talking about?

13:28.516 --> 13:29.733
Birds.

14:06.346 --> 14:08.724
"One of the greatest
birders I've ever seen"?

14:08.806 --> 14:10.183
Me?

14:10.933 --> 14:12.105
Crane, I'm touched.

14:12.769 --> 14:15.773
Do you ever think
about doing a Big Year?

14:15.855 --> 14:17.198
You could be
the next Bostick.

14:19.817 --> 14:23.321
<i>The programmer has
developed a remarkable ability.</i>

14:23.404 --> 14:24.496
Western tanager.

14:35.249 --> 14:39.299
<i>He can recognize hundreds
of species by sound alone.</i>

14:43.424 --> 14:45.893
Hey, all you birders.
I'm Annie Auklet.

14:45.968 --> 14:49.723
If you haven't sailed with me
before, yep, that's my real name.

14:50.390 --> 14:52.313
I love those seabirds
so damn much,

14:52.392 --> 14:54.520
I had it
legally changed in 1990.

14:56.104 --> 14:57.651
Now a couple of rules.

14:57.730 --> 14:58.947
If you can't swim,

14:59.023 --> 15:00.616
wear a life jacket.

15:00.691 --> 15:02.113
Rule number two,

15:04.445 --> 15:06.914
I'm in charge
of this itinerary.

15:06.989 --> 15:08.662
And if you have
a problem with that,

15:09.117 --> 15:10.960
you can take your
candy-colored butt

15:11.160 --> 15:13.379
and put it right back
in the rental car.

15:13.663 --> 15:15.336
All right.
Come on, line up.

15:15.415 --> 15:16.758
What was that all about?

15:16.833 --> 15:21.259
Back in '03, Annie stopped
a boat to look at a whale

15:21.337 --> 15:22.964
and Bostick
led a mutiny.

15:23.506 --> 15:25.554
Look, no one paid
to see Shamu!

15:25.633 --> 15:26.885
Get the hell
off my bridge!

15:26.968 --> 15:28.345
Just show us something
with some feathers

15:28.428 --> 15:29.850
or let me
steer this thing!

15:29.929 --> 15:31.931
Now you're gonna cut me?
Get off my bridge, pal!

15:32.014 --> 15:33.061
'Cause we won't
look at your whale?

15:33.141 --> 15:34.142
I'll use you for chum!

15:34.225 --> 15:36.068
You're crazier
than a road lizard!

15:36.978 --> 15:38.275
He kind of had a point.

15:38.354 --> 15:43.861
No, he is in violation of all the
unwritten rules for decorum and civility.

15:43.943 --> 15:46.537
Yeah, well, maybe that's what it takes
to be the greatest birder on Earth.

15:46.696 --> 15:49.791
Or maybe it just takes adding
a few birds to your list

15:49.866 --> 15:51.413
that perhaps
you never saw.

15:51.742 --> 15:54.291
Whoa. Are you saying
Bostick's a cheater?

15:54.370 --> 15:58.295
I'm just saying it'd be wise to
keep your eye on the sparrow.

15:58.374 --> 15:59.876
That record'll
never be broken.

16:00.042 --> 16:01.134
Yep.
Thanks, man.

16:01.210 --> 16:02.712
Thanks, man!
Thanks.

16:04.213 --> 16:07.717
Now, why would I help a pig like
you win another Big Year, Bostick?

16:08.050 --> 16:10.553
Because if he were trying
to do another Big Year,

16:10.636 --> 16:12.638
a pig like me
wouldn't want any help.

16:12.722 --> 16:15.020
But I'm not, Annie.
I'm just looking.

16:15.099 --> 16:17.852
Just trying to reconnect
with that little boy

16:17.935 --> 16:22.406
who fell in love with blue jays and
mourning doves a million years ago.

16:22.940 --> 16:24.317
You're not gonna
deny me that.

16:24.400 --> 16:25.617
Come on, have a heart.

16:26.068 --> 16:27.661
Just stay the hell
off my bridge.

16:28.029 --> 16:29.372
Deal.

16:38.122 --> 16:39.248
Western screech owl.

16:39.332 --> 16:40.709
Capital. Yes.

16:40.791 --> 16:42.168
You.
Okay.

16:45.087 --> 16:46.259
Red-shouldered hawk.

16:46.589 --> 16:48.762
Close, but no cigar.
Red-tailed hawk?

16:49.592 --> 16:52.095
Yes! You, sir,
win the stogie.

16:53.429 --> 16:54.430
Straight,
straight ahead.

16:55.306 --> 16:56.853
Kittiwake!

17:07.276 --> 17:09.869
<i>The reigning
king's hackles are raised.</i>

17:09.945 --> 17:11.914
<i>As with most alpha males,</i>

17:11.989 --> 17:14.833
<i>his instinct for
potential rivals is keen.</i>

17:14.951 --> 17:18.296
<i>He lulls his prey,
then pounces.</i>

17:18.371 --> 17:21.124
Seasickness? I feel for you.
That's the worst.

17:21.915 --> 17:23.509
These usually help.

17:23.626 --> 17:27.472
Yeah, some people say they're
just a placebo. Who knows?

17:29.173 --> 17:30.299
Oh! Here we go!

17:30.633 --> 17:32.226
Cod liver oil.

17:32.301 --> 17:33.803
Attracts birds
like honey,

17:33.886 --> 17:35.729
but smells like
fried cat puke.

17:36.347 --> 17:38.975
Sorry, shouldn't have said
"puke." Won't bother me.

17:39.350 --> 17:42.524
Lost my sense of smell in a
chem lab explosion years ago.

17:42.812 --> 17:44.314
That's lucky.

17:44.397 --> 17:45.990
Now, you want to be careful
with those binocs.

17:46.524 --> 17:49.403
'Cause once you lose sight of
that horizon, you can get lost.

17:49.527 --> 17:50.653
And then
you're done for,

17:50.736 --> 17:52.704
'cause all you feel is
the pitching and tossing.

17:53.447 --> 17:57.042
Pitching and tossing.
Pitching and tossing.

17:57.118 --> 17:59.246
I'm fine.
I'm fine.

17:59.912 --> 18:02.461
Hey, anybody up for
a little fish-head sushi?

18:04.458 --> 18:05.459
Mmm.

18:06.877 --> 18:08.754
Pitching and tossing.

18:09.046 --> 18:10.889
Pitching and tossing.

18:11.549 --> 18:12.675
Pitching and tossing.

18:14.010 --> 18:15.978
Whoa!

18:16.053 --> 18:17.680
You guys got a rag
or something?

18:18.806 --> 18:19.932
There we go.

18:20.182 --> 18:22.526
Maybe one with not so
much fish guts on it?

18:25.646 --> 18:26.898
You okay?

18:29.025 --> 18:30.868
It's not easy
being green.

18:33.195 --> 18:36.950
<i>Weather and planning are
deemed the factors most essential</i>

18:37.033 --> 18:38.660
<i>to a successful Big Year.</i>

18:38.743 --> 18:43.294
<i>But happenstance and
instinct are just as vital.</i>

18:43.372 --> 18:45.966
Hey, did you get a chance to see
that black-footed albatross?

18:46.167 --> 18:48.386
I sure did. Thanks.

18:48.502 --> 18:51.051
I'll leave you at peace.

18:51.797 --> 18:54.425
No, actually,
it helps to talk.

18:55.009 --> 18:56.807
But I wouldn't want you
to miss any birds.

18:56.886 --> 18:58.934
Ah! We're headed back.

18:59.013 --> 19:01.232
Besides, if there's anything
important, I'll know

19:01.307 --> 19:04.060
'cause I can
recognize them all by ear.

19:04.143 --> 19:05.144
No.

19:05.227 --> 19:06.820
Oh, yeah.
Really?

19:09.565 --> 19:10.987
What's that?

19:12.485 --> 19:15.580
That's Bostick
imitating a herring gull.

19:17.740 --> 19:19.413
Splendid!
Great!

19:21.077 --> 19:24.627
Bostick. I have him
to thank for this.

19:24.955 --> 19:26.252
What do you mean?

19:26.332 --> 19:29.802
He psyched me out.
Made me seasick.

19:30.127 --> 19:32.505
I think he thinks
I'm doing a Big Year.

19:32.588 --> 19:34.511
That is hardcore.

19:35.216 --> 19:36.468
Are you doing
a Big Year?

19:36.550 --> 19:39.429
No. You?

19:42.598 --> 19:44.441
Come on,
let's speed it up!

19:45.726 --> 19:47.979
The lad inside <i>says</i>
there's a suitable hotel

19:48.062 --> 19:49.860
on the 101,
halfway to Mount Shasta.

19:49.939 --> 19:53.864
Hotel? What, you think a snowy owl's
just gonna wait for us? Uh-uh.

19:53.943 --> 19:57.197
Only reason why I invited you was so we
can drive straight through. Chop, chop!

19:58.656 --> 20:01.626
<i>I can get you 10%
off the hotel in Savannah.</i>

20:01.701 --> 20:04.830
And I can put you on a direct
flight, but it's $100 more.

20:05.162 --> 20:07.631
Better stay with
the two layovers then.

20:08.916 --> 20:10.543
And your dad
wants to talk to you.

20:10.793 --> 20:12.591
- No. No, Mom. Mom, no.
- Yeah. Oh!

20:12.670 --> 20:13.762
He's grabbing the phone!

20:13.838 --> 20:15.135
Yeah. He's grabbing
the phone!

20:15.214 --> 20:16.340
<i>No, no, no.
Don't hand it to him.</i>

20:16.424 --> 20:18.301
<i>Mom? Mom.
I don't want to talk to him. Yeah!</i>

20:18.801 --> 20:20.223
<i>Yeah!</i>

20:20.594 --> 20:22.892
Where is our
world traveler today?

20:23.264 --> 20:25.392
Oregon.
Looking for seabirds.

20:25.474 --> 20:29.399
<i>Oregon. I guess everybody
needs a vacation.</i>

20:30.271 --> 20:31.614
It's not a vacation, Dad.

20:31.689 --> 20:33.111
It's not work.

20:33.190 --> 20:36.660
Unless somebody's paying you to
stay in hotels and look at birds.

20:36.736 --> 20:39.535
<i>Dad! Okay, okay, okay, you're right.
I'm sorry.</i>

20:39.822 --> 20:43.417
I guess I'm just kind of confused
about what a vacation is.

20:43.826 --> 20:45.499
Okay, Dad, you know what?
I gotta run.

20:45.703 --> 20:47.125
Hey. Hey. Brad?

20:47.204 --> 20:49.002
Great talking to you.

21:09.018 --> 21:10.691
Dear God.

21:12.521 --> 21:14.649
Probably could have used
another cup of coffee.

21:29.163 --> 21:30.506
I think I broke my arm.

21:30.581 --> 21:32.754
Shut up.

22:04.657 --> 22:08.036
<i>In nature, the
difference between life and death</i>

22:08.410 --> 22:11.380
<i>is very often
a matter of pure chance.</i>

22:11.455 --> 22:12.672
Unbelievable.

22:13.290 --> 22:15.918
This is the rarest bird
I've ever seen.

22:16.377 --> 22:18.926
It's like we were
meant to crash here.

22:19.004 --> 22:20.221
We were.

22:20.297 --> 22:23.426
<i>The reigning king has
survived</i> a <i>near-fatal crash,</i>

22:23.759 --> 22:27.605
<i>only to stumble upon
a great spotted woodpecker,</i>

22:27.680 --> 22:29.978
<i>a Code Four for him.</i>

22:30.099 --> 22:34.400
<i>There is no greater proof of the
righteousness of his crusade.</i>

22:34.478 --> 22:37.402
All of a sudden your arm doesn't
feel so broke, does it?

22:37.481 --> 22:39.074
You could
chop my arm off.

22:44.238 --> 22:45.330
How's the conference?

22:45.614 --> 22:46.786
How bad could it be?

22:47.283 --> 22:49.911
It's Paris.
How's it going there?

22:50.619 --> 22:53.247
Glorious! Dawn just broke.

22:53.330 --> 22:55.378
Tamaulipas crows'll
be here any minute.

22:55.457 --> 22:58.051
I'm happy for you.
But I wish you were here.

22:58.168 --> 23:00.045
You're just jealous.

23:00.963 --> 23:03.091
Mmm. Green.

23:04.675 --> 23:05.722
What was that?

23:07.928 --> 23:09.020
I'm renovating.

23:09.388 --> 23:12.267
Again? I thought we just got
done redoing the whole house.

23:12.349 --> 23:14.101
Uh-huh. But not the
upstairs and the kitchen.

23:14.184 --> 23:15.185
<i>Whoa, the kitchen?</i>

23:15.436 --> 23:16.653
I thought we had
an agreement that

23:16.729 --> 23:18.322
we were gonna wait
on doing the kitchen.

23:18.397 --> 23:20.900
I thought you agreed to wait
to do another Big Year.

23:20.983 --> 23:23.907
Jess, I've told you,
the birds wait for no man.

23:23.986 --> 23:25.033
<i>And neither do I.</i>

23:25.321 --> 23:28.825
So I had to hire Frank Falucci,
seeing as you're so busy.

23:28.991 --> 23:33.246
You hired my competitor?
That's gonna drag on forever.

23:33.329 --> 23:34.876
<i>No, 'cause I said to Frank</i>

23:34.997 --> 23:36.795
that I'd give him a bonus
if he was done by April.

23:36.874 --> 23:37.921
<i>A bonus?</i>

23:38.000 --> 23:39.343
All right,
but, jeez, babe, please,

23:39.418 --> 23:40.795
you've got to
keep an eye on this.

23:40.878 --> 23:43.347
You cannot
trust contractors.

23:43.797 --> 23:45.140
I'm well aware, honey.

23:45.549 --> 23:48.268
Okay, so is it old man Frank
in charge of the job,

23:48.344 --> 23:51.723
<i>or is it his kind of good-looking
son who's doing it?</i>

23:51.805 --> 23:54.103
He's not that good-looking.
Where are you, anyway?

23:54.183 --> 23:56.652
<i>I'm in Wyoming.
I got to bag a sage grouse.</i>

23:56.727 --> 23:58.445
Is it beautiful there?
No.

23:58.520 --> 24:01.148
It's hot and dusty.
It's a real dump.

24:03.609 --> 24:05.236
Ketchup potato chip?

24:05.694 --> 24:07.196
Ketchup potato chip?

24:07.696 --> 24:09.198
Ketchup potato chip?
No, thank you.

24:09.281 --> 24:10.498
You want
a ketchup potato chip?

24:10.574 --> 24:11.791
No?

24:17.873 --> 24:20.467
This is what happens
to retirees, Stu.

24:20.876 --> 24:22.219
They lose their minds.

24:22.711 --> 24:24.634
Hey, look, everybody!
Vultures!

24:27.049 --> 24:28.892
You have to handle
the negotiations yourselves.

24:28.968 --> 24:30.220
I told you, I'm done.

24:30.302 --> 24:32.805
The company is your baby,
sir, and it's in trouble.

24:32.888 --> 24:34.561
Yeah, and your baby's
wandered into the street.

24:34.640 --> 24:35.766
And there are cars coming.

24:35.849 --> 24:36.896
Your baby
needs you, Stu.

24:36.976 --> 24:38.193
Save your baby!

24:39.186 --> 24:40.733
You guys are pathetic.

24:42.898 --> 24:44.900
Two days. Two.
That's all we're asking.

24:45.025 --> 24:46.026
Just till
the deal's closed.

24:46.110 --> 24:47.236
And you'll never
hear from us again.

24:48.862 --> 24:50.409
Two days.
Then I'm done.

24:50.739 --> 24:52.662
You got it.
Two days in New York

24:52.741 --> 24:53.958
and then you migrate.

24:54.034 --> 24:55.251
Migrate!

24:55.327 --> 24:56.920
See, you're not the only one
with a sense of humor.

24:57.871 --> 24:59.544
Yes, I am.

25:01.750 --> 25:05.630
<i>The time has come for
the ruby-throated hummingbird.</i>

25:05.713 --> 25:10.844
<i>While other species migrate in
aerodynamic flocks or majestic "V's, "</i>

25:10.926 --> 25:13.099
<i>she flies alone.</i>

just to stay healthy,</i>

25:18.684 --> 25:22.814
<i>must cross 500 miles of
featureless blackness,</i>

25:22.896 --> 25:25.445
<i>high above
the Gulf of Mexico.</i>

25:26.275 --> 25:29.700
<i>Weeks of sustained eating have
prepared her for the journey,</i>

25:29.778 --> 25:33.828
<i>an innate, unerring sense of
direction tells her where to go,</i>

25:33.907 --> 25:38.413
<i>but nothing can prepare her
for bad weather.</i>

25:39.747 --> 25:45.174
<i>Bad weather is the deadly wild-card
for every bird who migrates.</i>

26:10.194 --> 26:11.741
Falucci.

26:12.946 --> 26:17.622
Long time no see, Bostick.
You remember my kid Frank Jr.

26:17.701 --> 26:19.544
It's a beautiful place
you got here, sir.

26:20.579 --> 26:21.831
Yeah, it was.

26:21.997 --> 26:25.501
All right, Falucci, I'm gonna be going
over your time sheets like a hawk,

26:25.584 --> 26:27.757
so you might want to
ease up on the snack breaks.

26:28.587 --> 26:30.214
Your wife
wasn't exaggerating.

26:30.297 --> 26:31.844
Everything with you
is birds, Bostick!

26:32.174 --> 26:33.801
Yeah, it is.

26:34.009 --> 26:35.352
<i>Jess?</i>

26:36.804 --> 26:38.021
<i>Jess?</i>

26:40.516 --> 26:44.521
No. No! What the...

26:45.145 --> 26:46.738
<i>Jess?</i>

26:48.524 --> 26:50.993
Hello, stranger.
This is a rare sighting. Hi.

26:51.068 --> 26:53.196
Yeah. What have you done
to our house?

26:53.278 --> 26:55.201
Do you like it so far?
So far?

26:55.489 --> 26:58.868
Please don't tell me there's more to come!
This is crazy!

26:59.076 --> 27:00.794
Are you trying to get my attention?
It worked.

27:00.869 --> 27:02.212
Is that the point
of all this?

27:03.372 --> 27:05.750
I don't know. I don't know, Kenny.
What is the point?

27:06.083 --> 27:08.677
I'm surprised to still see
this room standing,

27:08.752 --> 27:10.470
that you didn't take
a sledgehammer to this.

27:10.546 --> 27:12.344
I'm supposed to put my
life on hold for a year?

27:12.714 --> 27:14.307
Like a pathetic
golf widow?

27:14.383 --> 27:18.138
You're not a golf widow.
You can't compare golf to this.

27:18.220 --> 27:19.642
Golf's just like a hobby.

27:19.721 --> 27:21.940
And the birding
is what exactly?

27:22.891 --> 27:26.486
I don't know, it's like a calling.
This is like my calling.

27:26.770 --> 27:27.817
Like Gandhi?

27:27.896 --> 27:32.527
No, come on. I'm not comparing
myself to Gandhi, okay?

27:32.734 --> 27:37.490
That's ridiculous. Okay?
It's more like I'm Mozart, I guess.

27:39.199 --> 27:42.999
Okay, fine. You got a calling.
I got a calling, too.

27:43.078 --> 27:44.625
It's known <i>as</i> a baby.
Yeah.

27:44.705 --> 27:48.676
I know. I like to think that that's
like another one of my callings, too.

27:48.750 --> 27:51.720
And you're gonna have to contribute,
you realize, eventually.

27:51.795 --> 27:53.047
I realize.
In person.

27:53.630 --> 27:57.100
Yes. In person.
I wouldn't want it any other way.

27:57.176 --> 28:00.225
Really? 'Cause I ain't
so sure, Wolfgang.

28:00.304 --> 28:03.057
Maybe I can
convince you.

28:07.436 --> 28:08.483
I didn't mean now.

28:08.562 --> 28:10.815
Come on. What's
the matter with now?

28:10.898 --> 28:13.026
'Cause we have a house
full of men.

28:13.108 --> 28:14.610
Just pretend
they're not there.

28:17.112 --> 28:19.991
Okay, pretend that we don't
care that they're there.

28:20.616 --> 28:21.617
I'm pretending.

28:21.700 --> 28:23.373
<i>...throughout
much of the Southwest,</i>

28:23.452 --> 28:25.705
<i>spreading all the way
into the Pacific Northwest.</i>

28:25.787 --> 28:27.710
<i>Now, for those of you
in the Southeast,</i>

28:27.789 --> 28:30.292
<i>Texas will be experiencing
high winds this morning,</i>

28:30.375 --> 28:32.878
<i>as this storm moves
very quickly south</i>

28:32.961 --> 28:34.429
<i>into the Gulf of Mexico.</i>

28:34.504 --> 28:37.553
<i>If you're planning to be
anywhere in the Gulf today,</i>

28:37.633 --> 28:39.226
<i>better batten down
the hatches.</i>

28:39.301 --> 28:42.225
<i>We are talking about a storm
that may last for 72 hours.</i>

28:42.304 --> 28:43.897
<i>Look at these waves,
these winds,</i>

28:43.972 --> 28:45.645
<i>and strong storms.
Fallout.</i>

28:45.724 --> 28:48.773
<i>We are talking hurricane-force winds.
Kenny.</i>

28:49.770 --> 28:54.116
I know this is bad. I know this makes
me look like a world-class asshole,

28:54.191 --> 28:55.443
but, babe, I gotta go.

28:55.525 --> 28:57.994
Kenny! Kenny!

29:02.658 --> 29:03.784
Kenny!

29:03.867 --> 29:05.460
I'll call you!

29:16.922 --> 29:18.845
Bill? Don't say no.
I'm going to Texas.

29:18.924 --> 29:20.096
I'm getting on a plane
right now.

29:20.175 --> 29:21.802
Texas? You just got back.

29:22.010 --> 29:25.139
Bill! There is going to be
major fallout in a few hours.

29:25.222 --> 29:26.269
Nuclear fallout?

29:26.348 --> 29:27.770
Bird fallout.

29:28.517 --> 29:29.689
What are you
talking about?

29:29.768 --> 29:32.112
I'm talking about a major storm
hitting the Gulf of Mexico

29:32.187 --> 29:33.439
in the middle of
migration season.

29:33.522 --> 29:34.865
I'm talking about
headwinds and downpours

29:34.940 --> 29:37.693
and a hundred thousand birds
literally dropping from the sky!

29:39.444 --> 29:40.912
I'll put it down
as a sick day.

29:42.364 --> 29:43.365
Stu.
Hey.

29:43.448 --> 29:44.950
Where you going?
Texas.

29:45.033 --> 29:48.754
Texas? Now? What about Mclntire?
How do we explain this?

29:49.746 --> 29:50.918
Act of God.

29:51.206 --> 29:54.881
Act of God? No! That's not gonna work!
Stop this car! Stop this car!

29:55.377 --> 29:57.254
Those damn birds!

29:58.880 --> 30:03.306
<i>Sixteen hours have brought
Ruby within 20 miles of shore.</i>

30:03.385 --> 30:06.104
<i>But the tailwind that
carried her all this way</i>

30:06.179 --> 30:09.774
<i>is suddenly a headwind
blowing from the north.</i>

30:09.850 --> 30:13.980
<i>Now she must work twice as
hard to go half as far.</i>

30:14.062 --> 30:18.568
<i>The storm has knocked her from a
migrating altitude of 1,000 feet</i>

30:18.650 --> 30:21.278
<i>to a mere six feet.</i>

30:21.361 --> 30:25.082
<i>She can't swim.
One dip, and she's gone.</i>

30:27.117 --> 30:30.291
<i>The programmer arrives
on the outskirts of Houston,</i>

30:30.370 --> 30:33.419
<i>feeling for once that
luck is on his side.</i>

30:33.498 --> 30:35.296
I'm starting to think
I have a chance.

30:35.625 --> 30:40.677
<i>The roving CEO is also buoyant after
escaping his obligations in New York.</i>

30:40.839 --> 30:42.967
I really believe
I can win this thing.

30:43.133 --> 30:46.808
<i>The reigning king, not surprisingly,
is extremely confident.</i>

30:46.928 --> 30:50.273
Yes! Yes! I really think I've
got this thing locked up.

30:50.724 --> 30:52.567
<i>All three have
done the math.</i>

30:52.642 --> 30:55.646
<i>They know what
spring fallout means.</i>

30:55.729 --> 30:58.824
<i>A world record is
within their grasp.</i>

31:10.452 --> 31:11.453
Whoa!

31:13.955 --> 31:15.298
Unbelievable.

31:18.877 --> 31:20.049
Oh, my God.

31:31.390 --> 31:32.482
Faced with that headwind,

31:32.557 --> 31:34.559
they have to come down
at the first land they see,

31:34.643 --> 31:36.896
and that's right here.

31:36.978 --> 31:38.230
One thing's for sure,

31:38.313 --> 31:42.284
today's happening is strictly
for the birds. Gretchen.

31:42.734 --> 31:44.486
Come on, guys, get...
Keep it moving!

31:44.569 --> 31:46.321
Come on, we got
a lot of birds to see.

31:46.405 --> 31:50.410
Bloody ass. Only Americans can
turn birding into a competition!

31:50.492 --> 31:53.120
That's right.
You don't want to miss this one!

31:53.203 --> 31:54.329
What?

32:06.591 --> 32:09.094
Brad!
Stu!

32:09.177 --> 32:10.645
I knew you'd be here.
I was looking for you.

32:10.720 --> 32:12.814
Me, too.
This is incredible, isn't it'?

32:12.889 --> 32:14.516
I know.
Where do we even start?

32:17.978 --> 32:21.482
There's the best birder in the world.
Maybe we should...

32:22.023 --> 32:23.491
Follow him.

32:37.914 --> 32:39.040
Prothonotary warbler.

32:44.379 --> 32:45.801
Gotcha.

32:48.300 --> 32:50.519
Oh! Blue grosbeak.

32:50.594 --> 32:51.846
It's a buffet.

32:52.012 --> 32:54.265
<i>So I play what
the kids wanna hear</i>

32:54.347 --> 32:56.270
<i>While I spange on Broadway</i>

32:56.349 --> 32:58.818
<i>Shine, let it shine</i>

32:58.894 --> 33:01.989
<i>Even if it burns your eyes</i>

33:02.063 --> 33:04.282
<i>This light of mine is mine</i>

33:04.357 --> 33:06.735
<i>And I'm gonna
let it shine...</i>

33:07.068 --> 33:08.945
Ever get the feeling
you're being followed?

33:09.571 --> 33:10.663
Hello, master.

33:10.739 --> 33:11.740
How you doing, Stu?

33:11.907 --> 33:13.830
Still filling
those weekends, I see.

33:13.909 --> 33:15.911
Unless you and your son here
are doing a Big Year.

33:16.203 --> 33:21.380
Oh! Kenny Bostick,
this is my friend Brad Harris.

33:21.458 --> 33:23.005
Who's also not doing
a Big Year.

33:23.251 --> 33:25.754
That's funny how
nobody's doing a Big Year.

33:25.837 --> 33:28.090
Yeah. With all this
fallout and <i>El Niño.</i>

33:28.173 --> 33:31.302
Yeah, I know, you'd think the
conditions are just set up perfect

33:31.384 --> 33:33.478
for someone to have a real
shot at breaking my record.

33:33.762 --> 33:35.810
Not that record.
Pink-footed goose!

33:36.181 --> 33:38.024
Pink-footed goose,
other end of the boardwalk.

33:38.808 --> 33:40.560
What the hell's
that doing here?

33:40.644 --> 33:41.691
Be careful!

33:47.275 --> 33:48.902
Hey, put her down!

33:50.111 --> 33:52.614
Hey, hey, please,
let the explorers through!

33:53.240 --> 33:56.039
Of course.
Let's go, ladies. Jeesh.

33:56.284 --> 33:57.331
After you, kids.

33:57.619 --> 33:58.836
Get those badges.

33:59.120 --> 34:01.168
Chop, chop, chop, chop!
Step it up! Stepping lively!

34:02.624 --> 34:04.046
Move it along!

34:04.292 --> 34:05.293
Thank you.

34:13.592 --> 34:16.641
She took off. Headed north.
Probably be in Iceland by Friday.

34:16.721 --> 34:18.768
Boy, she was a beaut, too!

34:19.641 --> 34:21.518
Hey, is that a Calliope?

34:23.895 --> 34:26.068
Just another
ruby-throated.

34:26.147 --> 34:28.149
On everybody's list
by March.

34:28.733 --> 34:30.985
Sorry to disappoint
you boys again.

34:33.697 --> 34:38.703
<i>Not just another
ruby-throated, but our ruby.</i>

34:39.159 --> 34:44.212
<i>Drenched and diminished, frail
and trembling, but alive.</i>

34:44.498 --> 34:47.547
<i>Alive! Alive!</i>

34:53.341 --> 34:56.514
Good evening. Tonight's special is quail.
I highly recommend it.

34:58.638 --> 34:59.639
I couldn't.

34:59.723 --> 35:00.815
Yeah, not tonight.

35:00.890 --> 35:03.018
I'll have the halibut.

35:03.101 --> 35:05.149
And a bottle of
this Montrachet.

35:05.228 --> 35:06.320
Of course.

35:06.396 --> 35:09.525
And I will have the soup.
Thank you.

35:12.068 --> 35:15.288
Really? After being outside
all day in the wind and rain?

35:16.072 --> 35:17.369
Kind of a light eater.

35:18.658 --> 35:19.705
And the truth is

35:20.327 --> 35:22.705
the prices here are a little
steeper than I'm used to.

35:23.204 --> 35:26.629
Brad, I invited you to dinner.
I know, but...

35:26.708 --> 35:28.631
No, it's my pleasure.

35:28.710 --> 35:32.340
Look, when I'm birding, I don't
fly first class or hire guides.

35:32.422 --> 35:35.551
It's too much like corked
bats and steroids to me.

35:36.301 --> 35:39.555
But tonight
we're celebrating.

35:39.638 --> 35:43.359
We saw 136 species!

35:43.892 --> 35:45.860
Brad, 136!

35:45.935 --> 35:47.027
Here's to them.

35:47.354 --> 35:48.606
And to the one
who got away.

35:48.730 --> 35:49.822
Pink-footed goose.

35:52.108 --> 35:53.280
The Montrachet.

35:54.444 --> 35:57.163
Good. And my friend would like
to see the menu again, please.

35:57.238 --> 35:58.740
Of course.

35:59.658 --> 36:00.910
Cool.

36:00.992 --> 36:04.917
That shrimp scampi was calling
my name, if you must know.

36:04.996 --> 36:06.839
That's a little too much.
Okay.

36:06.915 --> 36:10.510
<i>In the afterglow
of their extraordinary day,</i>

36:10.585 --> 36:15.216
<i>the programmer and the roving
CEO forge a warm friendship</i>

36:15.298 --> 36:18.222
<i>deeply rooted in
their shared passion.</i>

36:19.302 --> 36:21.100
I mean, I'm 36.

36:21.721 --> 36:22.973
I'm divorced.

36:23.264 --> 36:25.392
I have a job I hate.

36:25.767 --> 36:29.112
I just want to do something big, you know?
Make my mark.

36:29.479 --> 36:30.731
So what are you gonna do?

36:31.773 --> 36:34.697
I'm working on something.

36:36.111 --> 36:37.488
My dad doesn't get it.

36:37.570 --> 36:40.244
He's had the same
boring job for 40 years.

36:40.907 --> 36:43.501
"That's what people do,"
he says.

36:43.576 --> 36:45.294
He's right.

36:45.787 --> 36:49.212
Most people just stay on the
beaten path, then one day,

36:49.290 --> 36:51.964
they wake up and realize they didn't
do everything they wanted to do.

36:52.460 --> 36:54.963
Look at me.
I was so afraid to retire,

36:55.046 --> 36:57.140
I had to do it twice before
I finally got out here.

36:57.465 --> 36:58.591
Why'd you wait so long?

36:58.675 --> 37:00.598
'Cause I'm an idiot.

37:01.636 --> 37:03.513
Okay, I gotta tell you.

37:04.889 --> 37:06.232
I'm doing a Big Year.

37:10.937 --> 37:12.029
Wow.

37:12.480 --> 37:13.732
I know.

37:14.190 --> 37:17.239
<i>The retired
CEO faces a dilemma.</i>

37:17.318 --> 37:20.788
<i>He feels true kinship
with the programmer.</i>

37:20.864 --> 37:23.492
<i>Should he divulge
his own Big Year?</i>

37:24.492 --> 37:25.835
Don't tell anybody, okay?

37:27.579 --> 37:30.924
<i>But with the exception of
certain pernicious bacteria,</i>

37:30.999 --> 37:35.880
<i>Homo sapiens is the most
competitive species on Earth.</i>

37:36.504 --> 37:38.177
Mum's the word.

37:39.007 --> 37:40.099
We won't have
to eat for a week.

37:40.175 --> 37:41.267
I'm hurting.

37:42.385 --> 37:43.978
Great dinner.

37:49.017 --> 37:50.189
Good luck.

37:50.310 --> 37:51.778
Thanks again.

37:53.104 --> 37:54.526
Hey, it's me,

37:54.814 --> 37:56.361
Mozart.

37:56.941 --> 37:58.989
The fallout's over
and now I'm calling

37:59.068 --> 38:01.196
to deal with the fallout
from the fallout.

38:01.863 --> 38:05.037
<i>Look, babe, I'm sorry.
I'm gonna make it up to you, you'll see.</i>

38:05.450 --> 38:06.667
I'm going to...

38:06.743 --> 38:08.370
<i>Where are you, anyway?
It's late there.</i>

38:08.495 --> 38:10.088
<i>I hope you're okay, babe.
Oh! Where am</i> I?

38:10.163 --> 38:14.669
I'm shooting hormones into my butt
so I can have your baby, Kenny.

38:15.043 --> 38:17.512
<i>Okay, I'm going to
hit the sack here,</i>

38:17.587 --> 38:19.134
<i>but I will try you
in the morning,</i>

38:19.214 --> 38:20.716
and I'm gonna be
launching a new thing

38:20.799 --> 38:22.676
called Operation
Sweep Her Off Her Feet.

38:23.218 --> 38:24.686
<i>So, you might
want to get ready,</i>

38:24.761 --> 38:26.559
<i>'cause it's gonna be
pretty spectacular.</i>

38:27.055 --> 38:29.979
<i>Okay? All right.
Talk to you tomorrow.</i>

38:35.396 --> 38:37.899
Pomarine jaeger,
nine o'clock!

38:48.576 --> 38:50.044
Brad.

38:51.079 --> 38:53.002
Brad!
No.

38:53.081 --> 38:54.549
Oh! Sorry.
Sorry.

39:19.941 --> 39:23.195
<i>"Met a dapper white-haired
guy who was really seasick</i>

39:23.278 --> 39:25.531
<i>"on a pelagic
near Coos Bay.</i>

39:25.613 --> 39:27.206
<i>"Got a peek at his list.</i>

39:27.282 --> 39:31.207
<i>"Four hundred and ninety-seven
species as of May 8.</i>

39:31.286 --> 39:33.209
<i>"He's definitely
doing a Big Year.</i>

39:33.371 --> 39:36.090
<i>"If he doesn't barf
himself to death."</i>

39:37.876 --> 39:40.800
<i>I still feel like a heel.
Feel like I led him on.</i>

39:40.879 --> 39:42.381
But I'm afraid if he
knew about my Big Year,

39:42.463 --> 39:44.306
Bostick'd get it
out of him eventually.

39:44.507 --> 39:47.511
And why is it so important to
keep this secret from Bostick?

39:47.594 --> 39:49.016
<i>Less competition
he thinks he has,</i>

39:49.095 --> 39:52.690
the more he's likely to
throttle back, not try so hard.

39:53.224 --> 39:54.897
Not grind for
the extra birds.

39:54.976 --> 39:56.649
Maybe I could
sneak past him.

39:56.978 --> 40:00.107
Do whatever it takes
to set that record, honey.

40:00.189 --> 40:02.567
You know how much
it means to me.

40:02.650 --> 40:04.368
<i>I miss you, doll.</i>

40:04.569 --> 40:06.196
What are you doing
this weekend?

40:06.279 --> 40:09.624
I could get us a room in Saint Paul,
not far from the Sax Zim Bog.

40:09.824 --> 40:12.418
Really!
Not far from the bog.

40:12.493 --> 40:14.712
Wow, you do know
how to woo a girl.

40:17.332 --> 40:19.755
Ah! There's my friend Jim
calling me.

40:19.834 --> 40:21.006
Uh-Oh.

40:22.462 --> 40:24.214
I love you.

40:24.297 --> 40:25.640
Spot something
rare for me.

40:25.715 --> 40:26.807
<i>You know I will</i>

40:28.843 --> 40:29.935
Hey, Jim.

40:30.345 --> 40:32.188
Yeah, listen,
talks broke down.

40:32.263 --> 40:34.436
Deal was dead
by 10:00. Over.

40:34.641 --> 40:36.939
<i>Total acrimony.
On the way out the door,</i>

40:37.018 --> 40:40.693
we agreed to a do-or-die
session, May 14th,

40:40.939 --> 40:42.441
<i>here in New York
in our office.</i>

40:42.523 --> 40:43.991
I can't. Impossible.

40:44.359 --> 40:45.736
<i>I'm flying to Attu
on the 14th.</i>

40:45.818 --> 40:46.819
To where?

40:47.070 --> 40:49.243
Attu, Alaska.
And I can't miss the flight.

40:49.322 --> 40:50.699
There's not another one
for a week.

40:50.907 --> 40:52.784
Stu, you're not involved,
the deal dies.

40:52.867 --> 40:54.210
Look, you gave these
people their jobs.

40:54.285 --> 40:55.878
If you don't do something,
they're gonna lose them!

40:55.954 --> 40:59.003
<i>And that means a hell of a lot
more than some birds on Attu.</i>

41:01.125 --> 41:05.130
<i>Attu. The westernmost
island of the Aleutian chain.</i>

41:05.672 --> 41:10.098
<i>So far west, it's closer to
Tokyo than to Anchorage.</i>

41:10.301 --> 41:12.599
<i>There are no hotels,
no phones,</i>

41:12.679 --> 41:15.432
<i>no restaurants
or permanent residents.</i>

41:16.057 --> 41:19.732
<i>But for birders,
Attu is paradise.</i>

41:20.436 --> 41:25.738
<i>Nobody could hope to win a Big Year
without going to Attu in May.</i>

41:28.569 --> 41:32.164
Mom's Taxi Service!
I'm sorry I'm late.

41:32.490 --> 41:34.618
You're gonna be a little
chilly in Alaska.

41:36.327 --> 41:37.829
I'm not going.

41:38.246 --> 41:40.590
Stop packing.
I'm serious! Mom!

41:40.665 --> 41:42.667
Are you upset because
you think you can't win,

41:42.750 --> 41:44.002
or because
he lied to you?

41:44.085 --> 41:46.258
Both.
And what about Bostick?

41:46.504 --> 41:47.505
Who?

41:47.588 --> 41:49.340
Kenny Bostick, the best
birder in the world.

41:49.424 --> 41:51.847
I think he might be
doing another Big Year.

41:51.926 --> 41:53.143
What chance do I have?

41:53.219 --> 41:57.599
Oh, Brad, you have 486 birds.
You're on a record pace.

41:58.057 --> 42:00.059
You can't quit now!

42:00.476 --> 42:03.025
Mom, my credit card is maxed out.
No. No. No. No.

42:03.104 --> 42:06.278
Even if I go to Alaska, there's
no way I can complete the year!

42:06.482 --> 42:08.610
This has 8 $6,000 limit.

42:09.027 --> 42:10.904
Bring me back
some Alaska pictures.

42:10.987 --> 42:12.580
No, Mom, I can't.
No, no, no, no.

42:12.655 --> 42:14.783
Get dressed.
Your plane leaves in an hour.

42:15.241 --> 42:16.914
Don't piss off
your travel agent.

42:19.454 --> 42:21.206
I had no idea this car
could go this fast.

42:21.289 --> 42:22.882
If you miss this plane,

42:22.957 --> 42:24.300
there's not another
one for a week.

42:24.375 --> 42:26.298
So, we gotta do it.

42:27.128 --> 42:29.005
Mom, Mom, Mom!

42:37.805 --> 42:40.103
Welcome back, Mr. Preissler!
Thank you.

42:40.183 --> 42:41.560
Thanks for
being here, Stu.

42:41.642 --> 42:43.485
I can give you
four hours, that's it.

42:43.561 --> 42:45.359
Then I've got to catch
my flight to Alaska.

42:45.438 --> 42:47.111
- No problem.
- How was your trip?

42:47.190 --> 42:48.658
Louisiana was spectacular.

42:48.733 --> 42:50.110
Lot of birds
in the bayou.

42:50.193 --> 42:53.538
And saw a loggerhead shrike from
my hotel room in Natchitoches.

42:53.654 --> 42:54.780
Adorable!

42:54.864 --> 42:57.037
It imitates the songs of other
birds to lure them in close.

42:57.116 --> 42:58.083
Uh-huh.

42:58.159 --> 43:00.582
Then it impales them on thorns,
breaks their necks and eats them.

43:00.787 --> 43:02.004
Yeesh!

43:02.080 --> 43:04.583
We'll assume the cost
of retrofitting the plants,

43:04.665 --> 43:06.292
but that still leaves
the non-compete clause.

43:06.375 --> 43:07.718
Barry says you have
an issue with it.

43:07.877 --> 43:10.926
No. It's not a big issue,
but I'm not like you, Stu.

43:11.005 --> 43:14.635
I'm not ready to hang it all up so I can
spend the rest of my life bird watching.

43:18.721 --> 43:20.974
It's called
"birding," Rick.

43:21.516 --> 43:23.109
And there's no
wiggle room here.

43:23.184 --> 43:25.278
This is a deal-breaker
for us.

43:26.479 --> 43:27.947
Wait, what?
Wait, wait, wait.

43:28.689 --> 43:31.784
Four hours ago, you said that
everything was negotiable.

43:31.859 --> 43:34.658
What, was this just so you could
lure me in to finish me off?

43:39.617 --> 43:41.119
The shrike.

43:41.202 --> 43:43.796
It's 11:15

43:43.871 --> 43:45.669
I should have left for the
airport 15 minutes ago.

43:48.376 --> 43:50.925
All right. Stu! Just wait, one
second, please. One second.

43:52.880 --> 43:55.884
Let me talk to my people.
Just give me five minutes. Okay?

44:13.818 --> 44:17.573
Okay, Stu, 48 months
and you got a deal.

44:18.239 --> 44:19.456
They'll shake.

44:19.532 --> 44:21.500
The Lexington side!
Okay, I'm coming out now!

44:21.576 --> 44:23.044
Are you there?

44:24.245 --> 44:27.795
Come up! Pull up in front!
There's taxis there. Flash your lights!

44:34.005 --> 44:36.303
Go! Go, go, go, go!

44:44.640 --> 44:47.018
Kenny? This is Karen,
my blushing bride.

44:47.101 --> 44:48.444
Attu's gonna be
our honeymoon.

44:48.769 --> 44:49.895
WOW!

44:50.188 --> 44:51.781
Okay, now, Karen, you're
not a birder, are you?

44:52.231 --> 44:55.155
No. No, I'm just
along for the ride.

44:55.234 --> 44:56.861
Honeymoon on Attu.

44:56.944 --> 44:59.163
That should be
unforgettable.

44:59.447 --> 45:01.120
Yeah.

45:01.616 --> 45:03.960
Attu?
What were you thinking?

45:07.121 --> 45:09.089
Come on, let's go!
What are we waiting for?

45:09.165 --> 45:11.543
The charter's sold out, but two
guys haven't shown up yet.

45:11.667 --> 45:12.884
I'm here!

45:13.836 --> 45:15.838
Okay, sorry.
Sorry I'm late.

45:16.672 --> 45:19.471
Sorry. Sorry I'm late.

45:21.761 --> 45:22.978
Okay.

45:28.184 --> 45:29.527
Nice of you
to join us.

45:41.155 --> 45:43.123
You're Stu's little
sidekick, aren't you?

45:43.199 --> 45:45.668
Oh, yeah,
me and Stu are like that.

45:45.743 --> 45:47.336
I know all his secrets.

45:47.411 --> 45:49.254
Yeah? Cookie?

45:49.997 --> 45:51.044
Yeah, thanks.

45:53.960 --> 45:55.758
All his secrets.

45:56.671 --> 45:58.890
Apparently, he's doing
a Big Year. Oops.

45:59.382 --> 46:01.305
He probably wouldn't
want you to know that.

46:11.018 --> 46:12.110
What's his total?

46:12.311 --> 46:14.188
By now? Over 500.

46:17.066 --> 46:18.534
Hey! Hey!

46:19.485 --> 46:20.987
Hey! Hey!

46:21.862 --> 46:23.535
Gives him a shot at your
record, doesn't it?

46:23.823 --> 46:26.121
Yeah. Yeah, that...

46:27.493 --> 46:29.040
He's a pretty
spry old guy.

46:29.120 --> 46:31.418
He's definitely got
a shot at my record.

46:31.497 --> 46:34.341
Of course, he probably would have had a
better shot if he had made this flight.

46:44.719 --> 46:46.562
Oh, God.

46:47.805 --> 46:49.523
What's your total?
Hmm?

46:49.598 --> 46:51.066
What's your total?

46:51.058 --> 46:52.526
I'm not doing a Big Year. No?

46:52.601 --> 46:53.853
Mmm-mmm.

46:54.437 --> 46:56.189
Another cookie?

46:56.272 --> 46:57.899
No, one's my limit.

47:11.537 --> 47:14.256
The pilot says this
is a Siberian storm?

47:14.415 --> 47:18.045
Attu Island, meet <i>El Niño.</i>
Makes for great birding.

47:25.718 --> 47:26.970
Oh, my God!

47:51.619 --> 47:53.872
Nice job up
there in the cockpit!

47:53.954 --> 47:56.673
Way to go, guys! Attu!

48:15.434 --> 48:16.981
Bostick!

48:18.896 --> 48:20.819
Welcome, birders, to Attu.

48:21.399 --> 48:23.777
<i>Welcome, birders, to Attu.</i>

48:26.695 --> 48:28.538
Let's take this spot.
Go right in here. In here.

48:28.614 --> 48:29.786
Okay. Yeah.

48:29.865 --> 48:30.912
I'll take the top.

48:30.991 --> 48:32.117
Yeah.

48:35.663 --> 48:38.132
Welcome to
the honeymoon suite!

48:38.207 --> 48:39.880
Unforgettable.

48:41.836 --> 48:42.962
Wally, how are you?

48:43.170 --> 48:44.638
Hey, Bostick.

48:45.464 --> 48:47.216
That Old Attu air.

48:52.012 --> 48:53.184
How you doing, Dolores?

48:53.264 --> 48:54.265
Mrs. Suzuki.

49:04.900 --> 49:05.901
Yeah.

49:17.705 --> 49:20.049
Oh, yeah.
Here they are.

49:21.542 --> 49:23.510
Now I'm in Attu.

49:28.048 --> 49:30.096
Prime real estate.

49:30.551 --> 49:31.848
Okay.

49:45.733 --> 49:49.488
I've only been here a week, and
my life list is already at 578.

49:49.570 --> 49:50.537
You want to see?
Are you serious?

49:50.613 --> 49:51.614
Yeah.
I'd love to.

49:51.739 --> 49:54.618
That is the American...
That's so beautiful.

49:54.700 --> 49:55.701
Yeah, golden plover.

49:55.784 --> 49:57.377
You guys
have the same eyes.

49:57.453 --> 49:58.420
Rustic bunting.

49:58.537 --> 50:00.289
- Excuse me.
- Massacre Valley.

50:01.415 --> 50:02.917
<i>Rustic bunting.</i>

50:03.876 --> 50:05.423
Coming through.
Hurry!

50:06.253 --> 50:08.927
Massacre Valley, come on!
Let's go, let's go!

50:09.757 --> 50:10.929
Just follow us!

50:11.008 --> 50:12.180
The south side trail.

50:15.179 --> 50:16.931
Kenny! Rustic bunting!

50:17.389 --> 50:19.062
Really?
I'll catch up to you.

50:37.409 --> 50:38.626
Go back!

50:38.702 --> 50:42.332
Go back, you guys!
The bunting flew back toward Casco Cove!

50:43.707 --> 50:46.210
The other way!
The rustic bunting is up there!

50:46.710 --> 50:49.338
Bunting's gone up the hill!
Turn around, turn around!

50:49.630 --> 50:52.179
The bunting flew down
the hill! Go back!

50:52.800 --> 50:53.767
What?
Go back!

50:53.842 --> 50:56.140
No, the bunting
flew down the hill!

50:56.971 --> 51:00.316
<i>Gladys, we finally found the bunting.
It's at Murder Point.</i>

51:02.768 --> 51:05.146
<i>The reigning
king has adopted a practice</i>

51:05.229 --> 51:08.233
<i>evolved by brilliantly
opportunistic birds</i>

51:08.315 --> 51:09.658
<i>like the skua.</i>

51:10.234 --> 51:14.489
<i>He lets others do the grunt
work, then seizes the spoils.</i>

51:21.787 --> 51:23.789
There's an eyebrowed
thrush back here.

51:28.544 --> 51:30.217
There it is!
Where?

51:50.482 --> 51:51.734
Oh, hey, everybody.

51:56.113 --> 51:57.205
Bostick.

52:12.212 --> 52:15.591
<i>I hear Jerusalem
bells are ringing</i>

52:15.674 --> 52:19.019
<i>Roman cavalry choirs
are singing</i>

52:19.094 --> 52:22.394
<i>Be my mirror,
my sword and shield</i>

52:22.473 --> 52:25.818
<i>My missionaries
in a foreign field</i>

52:25.893 --> 52:29.363
<i>For some reason
I can't explain</i>

52:29.438 --> 52:32.692
<i>I know Saint Peter
won't call my name</i>

52:32.775 --> 52:35.995
<i>Never an honest word</i>

52:36.070 --> 52:39.574
<i>But that was when
I ruled the world</i>

52:40.240 --> 52:42.618
<i>Jason, just so our
viewers can take precautions here,</i>

52:42.701 --> 52:44.499
<i>how severe is this
storm going to be?</i>

52:44.578 --> 52:46.251
<i>In one word,
it's going to be intense.</i>

52:46.330 --> 52:48.173
<i>We're expecting a
tremendous amount of snow.</i>

52:49.291 --> 52:50.884
<i>It'll be tough out there
for man or beast.</i>

52:50.959 --> 52:52.677
<i>But you were
telling me a moment ago,</i>

52:52.753 --> 52:54.255
<i>there are at least
a few people</i>

52:54.338 --> 52:56.340
<i>happy about this
Siberian storm, right?</i>

52:56.423 --> 52:59.802
<i>I can tell you that the birders
over at Attu are going to love it.</i>

52:59.885 --> 53:03.480
<i>So far they've spotted such
rarities as a pin-tailed snipe</i>

53:03.681 --> 53:05.558
<i>and an Oriental greenfinch.</i>

53:05.641 --> 53:07.268
<i>Snipe and greenfinch.</i>

53:07.351 --> 53:10.104
<i>And these are birds that nobody's
seen in North America for how long?</i>

53:10.187 --> 53:12.406
<i>Ten, 20, 30 years?</i>

53:12.481 --> 53:14.950
<i>Thirty years at least.
If ever.</i>

53:15.025 --> 53:17.027
<i>And I'm happy
if I can spot a pigeon.</i>

53:44.471 --> 53:45.814
Hey, Brad!

53:46.724 --> 53:48.067
I made it!

53:48.142 --> 53:50.736
Boy, oh, boy, are you a
sore for sight eyes, huh?

53:51.478 --> 53:52.604
I was just headed out.

54:03.741 --> 54:05.288
I wanted to tell you,

54:05.367 --> 54:08.211
but Bostick has a way of getting
information out of people.

54:08.287 --> 54:10.415
Yeah, I guess
he's not the only one.

54:10.664 --> 54:12.883
I didn't get it out of you, Brad.
You offered it to me.

54:12.958 --> 54:16.963
Oh, come on! You bought me
drinks and got what you wanted!

54:20.382 --> 54:22.009
That's not why
I asked you to dinner.

54:22.843 --> 54:24.060
I told you
about my wife.

54:24.470 --> 54:26.097
My fear of retirement.

54:26.180 --> 54:28.274
You think I'd discuss that
stuff with just anybody?

54:28.348 --> 54:32.069
Nope. Just the people you
think are doing a Big Year.

54:32.519 --> 54:33.611
Brad, listen.

54:33.687 --> 54:35.655
You were ready to talk
about your Big Year.

54:35.731 --> 54:38.325
I wasn't ready to talk about mine.
That's all it was.

54:38.525 --> 54:40.198
Have you checked
your messages lately?

54:40.527 --> 54:41.949
UP here?

54:42.696 --> 54:43.948
What, are you kidding me?

54:44.573 --> 54:48.328
I left a full confession
five days ago.

54:51.038 --> 54:52.540
I felt bad.

54:53.874 --> 54:54.921
Really?

54:56.376 --> 54:57.719
I'm sorry.

55:00.714 --> 55:02.011
Okay.

55:03.217 --> 55:05.720
I guess I have a
confession to make, too.

55:08.138 --> 55:10.106
You told Bostick,
didn't you?

55:10.182 --> 55:11.229
Yes. Sorry.

55:11.850 --> 55:13.523
On, well.

55:13.936 --> 55:16.735
Is it true this was the
greatest week in Attu history?

55:18.148 --> 55:20.651
Yeah. But the birds
are still here.

55:21.026 --> 55:23.745
Unless there's a freak blizzard,
you'll still get to see them.

55:38.293 --> 55:39.840
Sorry about
the freak blizzard.

55:41.338 --> 55:43.181
I shouldn't have said there's
gonna be a freak blizzard.

55:43.257 --> 55:44.554
That jinxed it.

55:47.427 --> 55:49.395
No, that's the thing.
We couldn't figure it out.

55:49.471 --> 55:53.817
What's a bird who only eats mosquitoes
doing in Wisconsin in February?

55:53.934 --> 55:55.777
Then we found it.
On the porch.

55:56.144 --> 55:57.191
Bug zapper.

55:57.271 --> 56:00.366
With a 12-month supply of
freeze-dried mosquitoes in its tray.

56:02.359 --> 56:04.032
That little sucker
was in heaven.

56:05.112 --> 56:07.490
How about the most tropical
bird you've seen this year?

56:07.573 --> 56:09.450
Western spindalis,
Key West.

56:09.783 --> 56:10.955
Hardest to find.

56:11.159 --> 56:12.285
Rufous-capped warbler.

56:12.369 --> 56:15.589
Perched on a toilet brush
in a cabin near El Paso.

56:17.791 --> 56:19.668
I almost wish
I didn't see that one.

56:20.961 --> 56:22.133
One that got away.

56:22.212 --> 56:24.715
That's easy.
Snowy owl.

56:24.798 --> 56:27.392
I just can't seem
to nail that sucker!

56:27.467 --> 56:29.890
I've been out six times this year
and I still haven't gotten one.

56:29.970 --> 56:31.392
Six trips to see one bird.

56:32.139 --> 56:34.233
That sounds an awful lot
like a man doing a Big Year.

56:36.560 --> 56:38.813
It takes one to know
one, right, Stu?

56:40.480 --> 56:44.235
Cheers. Of course, then again,
maybe I just love to bird.

56:56.788 --> 56:58.631
What do you got?
Bald eagle.

56:58.707 --> 57:01.426
Big deal!
We all got one five months ago.

57:01.668 --> 57:03.090
It's got
a lady friend.

57:03.795 --> 57:08.175
<i>Of all courtship
rituals, none is as spectacular</i>

57:08.258 --> 57:10.602
<i>as that of the bald eagle.</i>

57:10.677 --> 57:13.681
<i>A male and female climb
to dizzying heights</i>

57:14.264 --> 57:15.481
and then...

57:19.353 --> 57:21.401
<i>join in free fall,</i>

57:21.897 --> 57:23.240
<i>plummeting
towards the earth</i>

57:23.357 --> 57:25.280
<i>locked in each
other's embrace,</i>

57:25.359 --> 57:28.363
<i>separating only at
the very last moment.</i>

57:31.531 --> 57:33.033
God, I miss Edith.

57:34.868 --> 57:36.870
Yeah, I kind of miss Jess.

58:02.938 --> 58:03.939
Oh, hey.

58:04.898 --> 58:07.447
Oh! It's the man
with the golden ear.

58:07.985 --> 58:10.329
Yep. I thought you were
just lucky last time,

58:10.404 --> 58:12.156
but word has it
around the barracks

58:12.239 --> 58:14.867
that you're something
of an idiot savant.

58:15.534 --> 58:17.582
Without the "idiot" part.

58:17.828 --> 58:20.923
No, no, that's...
I'm an idiot.

58:22.040 --> 58:23.087
It's true.

58:23.583 --> 58:26.177
Okay, let me see if I
can try to stump you.

58:26.253 --> 58:27.345
Okay.

58:31.800 --> 58:33.052
Greater roadrunner.

58:33.343 --> 58:34.936
Yep. Not bad. Okay.

58:40.183 --> 58:42.652
Come on. Easy.
Common raven.

58:43.061 --> 58:45.439
Let's take it
to the next level.

58:45.605 --> 58:47.858
Okay. All right,
you asked for it.

58:53.864 --> 58:56.959
Oh, yeah.
Audubon oriole?

58:57.284 --> 58:58.877
Oh, yeah, wow.

58:58.952 --> 59:02.957
That, in my opinion,
is the most beautiful girl...

59:05.125 --> 59:08.425
Bird in the world.

59:13.300 --> 59:17.100
Is it true that you have
a life list of 578 birds?

59:17.971 --> 59:19.973
Yeah! Yeah.

59:20.640 --> 59:24.486
My mom thinks that my obsession
with birds is ruining my life.

59:24.603 --> 59:25.775
Tell me about it.

59:25.854 --> 59:28.824
My dad even blames the
birds for my wife leaving.

59:30.400 --> 59:32.494
But what does he know?

59:32.569 --> 59:34.913
I mean, that's not why.

59:35.655 --> 59:37.623
We had other issues. But...

59:39.618 --> 59:41.416
It was the birds.
It was the birds.

59:51.505 --> 59:53.678
Hey. How did it go?

59:55.258 --> 59:57.932
It kind of bogged down when I got
to talking about my ex-wife.

59:58.845 --> 01:00:00.347
I know, I know!

01:00:02.307 --> 01:00:05.277
That's about the top of the list
of the fifty worst pickup lines.

01:00:05.352 --> 01:00:07.821
Yeah.
"Hi. I'm divorced.

01:00:08.230 --> 01:00:11.860
"Didn't go so good, but I got a
good feeling about this one."

01:00:11.942 --> 01:00:12.943
Oh, boy.

01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:16.618
Ew! What is that smell?

01:00:16.696 --> 01:00:19.700
The good doctors are whipping up
a homemade batch of bird bait.

01:00:19.991 --> 01:00:22.335
We've been fermenting it
out back since we got here.

01:00:22.869 --> 01:00:25.088
It's like crack cocaine
to the gulls.

01:00:26.998 --> 01:00:29.171
What are you doing?
This is my scarf!

01:00:29.251 --> 01:00:30.377
Oh, sorry.

01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:32.383
This scarf is
from Bergdorf's!

01:00:32.587 --> 01:00:35.682
This scarf cost $250!

01:00:36.424 --> 01:00:37.892
I wouldn't go out there if I...
Shut up!

01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:40.137
Look at my scarf!

01:00:42.722 --> 01:00:44.224
This should be fun.

01:00:51.982 --> 01:00:53.279
on, no! No!

01:00:55.235 --> 01:00:57.613
Get away!
Honey? Throw it away!

01:00:57.821 --> 01:00:59.118
Go...
Get away!

01:00:59.656 --> 01:01:01.579
Don't take my scarf!
Give it back to me!

01:01:05.579 --> 01:01:06.705
Hitchcockian.

01:01:15.672 --> 01:01:17.265
What's he doing up there?

01:01:19.259 --> 01:01:21.182
How many do you think
he has?

01:01:21.261 --> 01:01:23.138
I wouldn't guess.

01:01:23.221 --> 01:01:25.223
But you know what?

01:01:25.307 --> 01:01:26.479
That's not the point.

01:01:27.934 --> 01:01:29.857
We can't take our
eyes off the ball.

01:01:29.936 --> 01:01:32.234
You think he lets
anything slow him down?

01:01:33.481 --> 01:01:35.700
I made work my priority
and I missed the boat.

01:01:35.775 --> 01:01:37.618
You got your feelings hurt
and you almost quit!

01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:39.367
No more, Brad.

01:01:39.446 --> 01:01:41.744
Think like him,
act like him.

01:01:41.948 --> 01:01:43.791
One of us
has to beat this SOB!

01:01:44.034 --> 01:01:46.128
Yeah. Yeah!

01:01:47.412 --> 01:01:48.789
And here's what
you do about Ellie!

01:01:48.997 --> 01:01:50.465
I don't think I'm ready.

01:01:50.624 --> 01:01:52.251
Tell her you want to
exchange phone numbers

01:01:52.334 --> 01:01:54.177
in case there's a rare
sighting this summer.

01:01:54.294 --> 01:01:56.296
I said I'm not ready!

01:01:57.047 --> 01:01:58.799
But that is
a really good idea.

01:02:00.550 --> 01:02:01.802
Thanks.

01:02:02.761 --> 01:02:04.138
Good luck, Stu.

01:02:08.308 --> 01:02:09.309
Whoo!

01:02:24.199 --> 01:02:27.203
<i>Summer is a season
of peripatetic activity</i>

01:02:27.285 --> 01:02:29.333
<i>for North American fauna.</i>

01:02:35.001 --> 01:02:40.178
<i>Inspired by the CEO, the programmer
is among the most peripatetic.</i>

01:02:41.341 --> 01:02:45.847
<i>I'm feeling
restless, but I'm tired</i>

01:02:46.513 --> 01:02:49.437
<i>Don't want to leave,
but I can't stay</i>

01:02:51.309 --> 01:02:55.940
<i>You and me
need something more</i>

01:02:56.022 --> 01:03:00.778
<i>It's time to
spread our wings and go</i>

01:03:00.860 --> 01:03:05.912
<i>So come, fly away</i>

01:03:05.991 --> 01:03:11.794
<i>Through the clouds into the
sun Far away from everyone</i>

01:03:11.871 --> 01:03:16.297
<i>Come, fly away</i>

01:03:16.376 --> 01:03:19.050
<i>When we get
above the rain</i>

01:03:19.129 --> 01:03:23.885
<i>They are all sunny days</i>

01:03:26.136 --> 01:03:28.309
<i>A-well-a, everybody's
heard about the bird</i>

01:03:28.388 --> 01:03:29.981
<i>Bird, bird, bird...</i>

01:03:30.056 --> 01:03:31.148
Hello. Hi.

01:03:31.224 --> 01:03:33.852
You know that pink-footed goose
that you missed in Texas?

01:03:34.561 --> 01:03:36.689
Guess what just
showed up here in Boston.

01:03:38.231 --> 01:03:39.232
Really?

01:03:46.406 --> 01:03:50.536
<i>The divorced programmer
tells himself to trust his instinct.</i>

01:03:51.036 --> 01:03:54.836
<i>Has he finally
met the right mate?</i>

01:03:58.418 --> 01:03:59.419
Ellie!

01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:01.592
Hey.
Hi.

01:04:03.131 --> 01:04:04.132
How's your
Big Year going?

01:04:04.215 --> 01:04:06.809
I don't want to jinx it,
but it's going very, very good.

01:04:06.885 --> 01:04:09.058
I saw a flamingo in the
Everglades last week.

01:04:09.137 --> 01:04:10.138
WOW!

01:04:10.221 --> 01:04:13.145
Got about a thousand mosquito
bites, but it was worth it.

01:04:13.558 --> 01:04:16.277
Doing a Big Year
and working full-time?

01:04:16.853 --> 01:04:18.070
I really admire that, Brad.

01:04:18.146 --> 01:04:21.525
You know what I admire?
That you're not doing a Big Year.

01:04:21.608 --> 01:04:23.326
Why?
Because it's pure!

01:04:23.401 --> 01:04:25.745
It's all about
the love of birds for you.

01:04:25.820 --> 01:04:27.322
How do you know I'm
not doing a Big Year?

01:04:32.285 --> 01:04:34.379
You left it there?
You're brave.

01:04:34.746 --> 01:04:36.748
But Darren's driving.

01:04:36.831 --> 01:04:38.879
Nice. Darren?
My boyfriend?

01:04:38.958 --> 01:04:40.881
Ah!
Darren, this is Brad.

01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:42.883
Welcome to Boston, bro.

01:04:44.339 --> 01:04:48.219
So, Ellie tells me you guys
are going to look for a...

01:04:48.301 --> 01:04:49.518
What is it,
a pink goose?

01:04:50.053 --> 01:04:51.179
No, it's not...

01:04:51.262 --> 01:04:52.354
Nope. Not a pink goose.

01:04:52.472 --> 01:04:54.395
No such thing
as a pink goose.

01:04:54.474 --> 01:04:56.226
It's a pink-footed goose,
<i>so...</i>

01:04:56.309 --> 01:04:58.778
If I came to see a pink goose,
then I guess this whole trip

01:04:58.853 --> 01:05:00.321
would have been a big waste
of time, wouldn't it?

01:05:00.397 --> 01:05:02.274
"Pink goose."

01:05:02.690 --> 01:05:04.613
Maybe there's a purple
swan out there, too.

01:05:05.652 --> 01:05:06.949
Let's go!

01:05:07.404 --> 01:05:09.577
You want to
hear the punch line?

01:05:09.656 --> 01:05:11.954
The pink-footed goose
had already skipped town.

01:05:12.033 --> 01:05:13.455
<i>We'll get it one day.</i>

01:05:13.535 --> 01:05:15.754
Brad, Edith had a boyfriend
when I first met her.

01:05:15.829 --> 01:05:17.081
You never know.

01:05:17.163 --> 01:05:19.291
The final chapter might not
be written with Ellie.

01:05:19.374 --> 01:05:20.375
Yeah.

01:05:20.959 --> 01:05:22.336
Thanks, Stu.

01:05:23.837 --> 01:05:27.432
<i>The retired CEO knows
that the days he missed on Attu</i>

01:05:27.507 --> 01:05:28.759
<i>have cost him dearly.</i>

01:05:29.676 --> 01:05:32.896
<i>But upon his return to the
mainland, there is news.</i>

01:05:35.432 --> 01:05:36.524
Hey' Hey.

01:05:38.476 --> 01:05:40.023
Congratulations.
Thank you.

01:05:40.979 --> 01:05:42.697
Come see.
Can't wait.

01:05:44.858 --> 01:05:46.451
Wow. He's adorable.

01:05:46.526 --> 01:05:47.698
Hey, Grandpa.

01:05:48.987 --> 01:05:50.364
What's his name?

01:05:50.864 --> 01:05:51.865
No one told you?

01:05:52.198 --> 01:05:54.246
All I heard was you
hadn't decided yet.

01:05:54.325 --> 01:05:56.919
Name's Stuart, Dad.
Call him Stu.

01:06:00.540 --> 01:06:01.541
Really?

01:06:03.126 --> 01:06:04.252
Well, that's something.

01:06:04.711 --> 01:06:05.803
You want to hold him?

01:06:05.879 --> 01:06:06.880
Yeah.

01:06:07.422 --> 01:06:08.548
Hey.

01:06:09.382 --> 01:06:10.725
Hold his head.
I remember.

01:06:14.888 --> 01:06:17.232
Stu! Stu!

01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:20.735
How you doing? How you doing?

01:06:21.227 --> 01:06:23.400
Hey, you don't want
to look at big face?

01:06:25.815 --> 01:06:27.362
Hey, buddy.

01:06:27.567 --> 01:06:30.036
Hey. Hey, buddy.

01:06:30.445 --> 01:06:32.573
Ain't he cute? So cute.

01:06:36.784 --> 01:06:38.411
Spotted something rare
for you.

01:06:39.746 --> 01:06:41.874
Hey, buddy.
You want to go birding?

01:06:43.082 --> 01:06:45.631
Huh? Want to do the rumba?

01:06:49.881 --> 01:06:51.098
Taxi!

01:06:52.133 --> 01:06:53.134
JFK.

01:06:55.261 --> 01:06:56.262
Bye.

01:07:00.016 --> 01:07:01.359
<i>In the days that follow,</i>

01:07:01.434 --> 01:07:03.857
<i>it proves harder than
he could have guessed</i>

01:07:03.937 --> 01:07:05.860
<i>to resume his Big Year.</i>

01:07:07.941 --> 01:07:11.616
<i>And in the teeming profusion
of life that is summer,</i>

01:07:12.111 --> 01:07:15.206
<i>he sees his own
mortality everywhere.</i>

01:07:15.281 --> 01:07:17.625
<i>Even in a blade of grass.</i>

01:07:19.911 --> 01:07:21.709
<i>He misses his wife.</i>

01:07:23.748 --> 01:07:26.627
<i>He misses his life.</i>

01:07:29.754 --> 01:07:34.225
<i>ls his migrating instinct
waning at long last?</i>

01:07:41.516 --> 01:07:43.939
Blue-footed booby!
Orcas Island, right?

01:07:47.105 --> 01:07:48.357
Hey.
How many?

01:07:48.439 --> 01:07:49.941
You might want
to sit down.

01:07:50.024 --> 01:07:52.072
Edith gave me
a pep talk last month.

01:07:53.945 --> 01:07:54.946
<i>707.</i>

01:07:56.948 --> 01:07:57.949
You?

01:07:58.116 --> 01:07:59.208
715.

01:08:00.159 --> 01:08:02.582
You're not bad at
the pep talks yourself.

01:08:02.662 --> 01:08:04.289
Me and my big mouth.

01:08:04.372 --> 01:08:05.419
How many?

01:08:08.167 --> 01:08:09.214
715.

01:08:09.335 --> 01:08:11.713
Wow! Welcome to
the 700 Club, kid.

01:08:11.963 --> 01:08:13.556
That is rarified air.

01:08:14.090 --> 01:08:16.013
Of course, it's this old-timer
we got to worry about.

01:08:16.091 --> 01:08:17.765
What's your number?
You don't want to know.

01:08:17.844 --> 01:08:19.971
I do. Scare me.
How about 730?

01:08:22.348 --> 01:08:23.520
Really?

01:08:24.017 --> 01:08:26.941
Wow, and here I thought
I was the bomb at 728.

01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:29.819
Hey, hang in there.
You still got a shot.

01:08:29.897 --> 01:08:33.527
Yeah. Thank you for that
reassuring pat on my shoulder.

01:08:33.609 --> 01:08:34.907
All right,
have a good day.

01:08:35.528 --> 01:08:37.781
I just wanted to wipe that
cocky grin off his face.

01:08:37.863 --> 01:08:40.332
You did that. He looked like
he'd just read his own obituary.

01:08:40.408 --> 01:08:41.625
And we got his total.

01:08:41.701 --> 01:08:43.203
Okay, yes, okay! Okay!

01:08:43.286 --> 01:08:45.459
But I think you just
woke a sleeping dog.

01:08:46.205 --> 01:08:48.549
Yeah, yeah,
we're getting on the boat.

01:08:48.625 --> 01:08:50.046
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

01:08:50.126 --> 01:08:51.719
Did our friend just say
where he was going?

01:08:52.086 --> 01:08:54.384
He wanted directions to
the Skagit Wildlife Area.

01:08:55.631 --> 01:08:56.849
Blue-footed booby's
on the move.

01:09:03.014 --> 01:09:04.265
This is me.

01:09:27.913 --> 01:09:28.915
No bird.

01:09:29.749 --> 01:09:30.841
And no Bostick.

01:09:31.084 --> 01:09:33.962
NARBA says the blue-footed
booby's still on the island.

01:09:35.546 --> 01:09:37.594
And we just missed
the last ferry.

01:09:41.094 --> 01:09:42.515
You know
the beauty of it?

01:09:42.929 --> 01:09:46.103
He never lied to us.
He never even spoke to us.

01:09:47.392 --> 01:09:49.109
The man's a genius.

01:09:50.728 --> 01:09:52.901
728!

01:09:53.022 --> 01:09:55.696
He's a machine.
He's a birding machine.

01:09:57.777 --> 01:09:59.279
Unless he was
bluffing, too.

01:10:00.029 --> 01:10:01.281
Or cheating.

01:10:04.659 --> 01:10:05.911
Maybe he just
wants it more.

01:10:05.993 --> 01:10:07.245
Oh, screw that!

01:10:07.662 --> 01:10:10.165
I've spent 10 months of my life
on this, and every penny I have.

01:10:10.248 --> 01:10:12.876
There is no way he
wants it more than me!

01:10:17.004 --> 01:10:19.723
Remember when you said one
of us has to beat this SOB?

01:10:21.426 --> 01:10:22.427
Maybe we should...

01:10:22.635 --> 01:10:23.602
Team up.

01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:28.141
Team up!

01:10:30.393 --> 01:10:34.364
<i>I can't look
at the rocket launch</i>

01:10:34.439 --> 01:10:37.113
<i>The trophy wives
of the astronauts</i>

01:10:37.191 --> 01:10:40.616
<i>And I won't listen
to their words</i>

01:10:40.695 --> 01:10:42.914
<i>'Cause I like</i>

01:10:42.989 --> 01:10:43.990
<i>Birds</i>

01:10:51.247 --> 01:10:54.501
<i>I don't care
for walking downtown</i>

01:10:54.584 --> 01:10:58.555
<i>Crazy autocar
gonna mow me down</i>

01:10:58.629 --> 01:11:01.223
<i>Look at all the people
like cows in a herd</i>

01:11:01.299 --> 01:11:03.768
<i>Well, I like</i>

01:11:03.843 --> 01:11:04.935
<i>Birds</i>

01:11:09.015 --> 01:11:11.109
I'm exhausted.
I couldn't take another step.

01:11:12.685 --> 01:11:13.686
Sandhill crane!

01:11:14.687 --> 01:11:15.859
Oh, shit!

01:11:17.523 --> 01:11:18.524
<i>You took him up?</i>

01:11:19.192 --> 01:11:20.535
Okay. Thanks, Gil.

01:11:22.528 --> 01:11:24.155
Bostick saw snowcocks.

01:11:24.238 --> 01:11:26.332
I can't
afford snowcocks!

01:11:27.241 --> 01:11:28.834
Snowcocks are on me.

01:11:29.869 --> 01:11:31.337
I can't even
afford this beer.

01:11:31.412 --> 01:11:32.880
That's on me, too.

01:11:33.998 --> 01:11:35.625
You ever been
in a helicopter?

01:11:35.708 --> 01:11:36.709
Ah!

01:11:42.590 --> 01:11:45.469
So, how long until we see
some Himalayan snowcocks?

01:11:46.552 --> 01:11:48.600
You never know.
It's a matter of luck.

01:11:52.767 --> 01:11:54.815
Do we have to fly this
close to the mountains?

01:11:55.019 --> 01:11:57.113
Close? This isn't close.
You want to see close?

01:11:57.188 --> 01:11:58.360
No. No, no, no, no, no!

01:12:02.068 --> 01:12:03.069
Whoa!

01:12:14.497 --> 01:12:15.498
All right,
there, there, there!

01:12:15.581 --> 01:12:17.424
Himalayan just cleared the ridge!
You see it?

01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:18.501
No!
No!

01:12:18.584 --> 01:12:19.881
Oh, man! Come on, look!

01:12:28.302 --> 01:12:30.225
Where are you?
Come on.

01:12:32.431 --> 01:12:33.432
There! There, there!

01:12:33.516 --> 01:12:35.644
There, you see it?
Right there!

01:12:38.896 --> 01:12:40.318
Ride 'em, cowboy!

01:12:40.898 --> 01:12:42.320
Uh-Oh!
Ah!

01:12:42.608 --> 01:12:43.985
Oh, God!

01:12:47.989 --> 01:12:48.990
We're good.
We're good.

01:12:49.156 --> 01:12:50.749
Can we go home now?

01:12:50.825 --> 01:12:52.122
Don't you want
to get it on film?

01:12:52.201 --> 01:12:54.078
Hell, no!
No! No! Home!

01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:08.801
Hey!

01:13:09.969 --> 01:13:11.016
We're alive!

01:13:11.095 --> 01:13:12.347
We saw snowcocks!

01:13:13.306 --> 01:13:14.398
Hey!

01:13:15.808 --> 01:13:18.357
We're on a roll!
Nothing can stop us now!

01:13:18.436 --> 01:13:20.780
<i>A-well-a, everybody's
heard about the bird</i>

01:13:20.855 --> 01:13:22.903
<i>Bird, bird, bird,
b-bird.</i> . .

01:13:22.982 --> 01:13:24.325
Hey, Mom.

01:13:27.778 --> 01:13:28.779
What?

01:13:31.741 --> 01:13:32.867
It's all right.
It's okay.

01:13:35.620 --> 01:13:38.089
So how many of these damn
tests are these clowns

01:13:38.164 --> 01:13:40.713
gonna put me through before they
let me get the hell out of here?

01:13:41.083 --> 01:13:42.630
Dad, you had
a heart attack.

01:13:43.169 --> 01:13:44.716
I had a minor heart attack,
all right?

01:13:44.795 --> 01:13:48.015
In my old man's day, it was not
something you went to the hospital for.

01:14:00.978 --> 01:14:04.858
Let me show you
some shots from the trip.

01:14:08.653 --> 01:14:11.281
My little hobby.
You should take a look.

01:14:12.406 --> 01:14:14.454
What do we got here?
There we go.

01:14:14.533 --> 01:14:17.036
Colima warbler.
That's Texas.

01:14:17.620 --> 01:14:19.668
Had to hike eight miles
to see that guy.

01:14:22.458 --> 01:14:23.675
That's a spruce grouse.

01:14:23.918 --> 01:14:26.296
Maine. That was butt-cold.

01:14:28.547 --> 01:14:29.548
Another spruce grouse.

01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:34.350
There's my favorite bird.
American golden plover.

01:14:35.221 --> 01:14:38.395
That's your favorite bird.
It's gray.

01:14:38.599 --> 01:14:40.397
Yes, it is.
Well, gray-brown.

01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:44.063
Yeah, a lot of people wouldn't
think twice to look at this bird,

01:14:44.146 --> 01:14:47.116
but this golden plover's one of the
greatest travelers in the world.

01:14:47.942 --> 01:14:51.071
It's true. It breeds
in the Arctic tundra,

01:14:51.153 --> 01:14:53.030
then flies all the way
down to Argentina

01:14:53.114 --> 01:14:54.536
and back,
all in one year.

01:14:55.658 --> 01:14:57.660
It shows up on beaches
of Guatemala.

01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:01.168
On farms in Illinois.

01:15:02.623 --> 01:15:04.341
Nine inches long,

01:15:04.417 --> 01:15:07.341
but he travels hundreds of thousands
of miles in his lifetime.

01:15:08.295 --> 01:15:10.844
No passports, no security.
Total freedom.

01:15:12.758 --> 01:15:17.104
Yeah. This gray bird has
seen some amazing things.

01:15:18.764 --> 01:15:21.688
And that's the bird that
everybody underestimates.

01:15:44.623 --> 01:15:45.670
Yes!

01:15:47.126 --> 01:15:49.003
Hey. Did you see a f lammer?

01:15:49.086 --> 01:15:50.963
I heard it.
He just answered my call.

01:15:51.047 --> 01:15:52.549
Which direction?
It doesn't matter.

01:15:52.631 --> 01:15:54.133
We both heard it.
That counts.

01:15:54.258 --> 01:15:55.384
How do I know
what I heard?

01:15:55.468 --> 01:15:58.813
Maybe I just heard you.
Maybe I heard some SOB answering you.

01:15:59.138 --> 01:16:00.890
I'm claiming it.
I mean, you heard what I heard.

01:16:00.973 --> 01:16:01.974
You should claim it, too.

01:16:02.058 --> 01:16:04.561
Just tell me
which direction, pal.

01:16:04.643 --> 01:16:06.145
It's over here.

01:16:07.146 --> 01:16:09.194
Hey, hold up.
I'll go with you.

01:16:09.356 --> 01:16:11.484
Hey, Stu.
Yeah, walk with me.

01:16:13.277 --> 01:16:16.121
That was some trick you pulled
on us at Anacortes Ferry.

01:16:16.197 --> 01:16:17.949
What trick?

01:16:18.741 --> 01:16:20.960
Bostick, you're
a hard guy to figure.

01:16:21.035 --> 01:16:24.209
Seems like you'd do anything to
win, but that's not true, is it?

01:16:24.455 --> 01:16:26.833
I work the angles
just like everyone does.

01:16:26.916 --> 01:16:28.793
Maybe even better.

01:16:28.876 --> 01:16:31.299
Yeah, but when it comes
to the honor system,

01:16:31.378 --> 01:16:32.800
you're as pure as snow.

01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:36.475
Everyone in the clubhouse knows
which guy cheats on his score.

01:16:36.550 --> 01:16:39.144
He's kind of pathetic.
Who'd want to be that asshole, right?

01:16:39.970 --> 01:16:42.439
Bostick, this is
strange to say,

01:16:42.515 --> 01:16:45.018
but I actually
kind of like you.

01:16:45.559 --> 01:16:47.232
I kind of like you,
too, Stu.

01:16:47.728 --> 01:16:50.857
Yeah, you seem like a...
You seem like a genuinely nice guy.

01:16:51.482 --> 01:16:53.109
Course, wasn't that
how you got to Brad?

01:16:53.859 --> 01:16:56.453
I didn't get to...
Yell if you find a f lammer.

01:16:58.364 --> 01:16:59.581
Bostick!

01:17:01.242 --> 01:17:05.463
I see that you're going to come
back at least a couple more times

01:17:05.538 --> 01:17:08.337
So just fill out those forms
and we'll see you again.

01:17:08.415 --> 01:17:10.042
Okay, great.
Thank you.

01:17:10.126 --> 01:17:11.628
Okay. We're all set.

01:17:11.710 --> 01:17:14.179
But we do need your
husband here very soon.

01:17:14.255 --> 01:17:15.598
He'll be here.

01:17:37.236 --> 01:17:38.658
Sorry.
Am I hurting you?

01:17:38.737 --> 01:17:40.364
Oh, not at all.

01:17:40.614 --> 01:17:43.458
Your husband does know
today's the day?

01:17:43.534 --> 01:17:44.911
Oh, yeah.

01:17:46.996 --> 01:17:47.997
Yeah.

01:17:53.127 --> 01:17:55.004
How you doing?
Good. How are you, sir?

01:17:55.087 --> 01:17:56.430
Tired.

01:18:23.032 --> 01:18:26.457
The doctor's ready.
Should we maybe call your husband?

01:18:28.662 --> 01:18:30.380
Can we give him
five more minutes?

01:18:32.750 --> 01:18:33.797
Okay.

01:18:35.669 --> 01:18:36.921
Bostick!

01:18:52.019 --> 01:18:54.818
Yeah. Bostick, guess
what I'm looking at.

01:18:55.522 --> 01:18:56.899
Snowy owl.

01:18:57.483 --> 01:19:01.989
<i>Catch the 4:30 to Buffalo and you
will obliterate your own record.</i>

01:19:07.660 --> 01:19:10.163
Hold on.
Kenny, where are you?

01:19:10.496 --> 01:19:15.377
Jess, you cannot believe how hard
I have tried today to get there.

01:19:15.459 --> 01:19:19.589
It's just been a complete
nightmare here in Chicago.

01:19:19.672 --> 01:19:20.924
Hold on.

01:19:23.467 --> 01:19:25.720
They've got like
all the planes grounded,

01:19:25.803 --> 01:19:28.022
or something,
I don't know why...

01:19:45.531 --> 01:19:46.828
Here you go, Mrs. B.

01:19:49.660 --> 01:19:51.788
Sounds like you could
use a cup of tea.

01:19:53.956 --> 01:19:56.129
Thanks, Frankie.
Yeah.

01:20:01.547 --> 01:20:03.970
<i>A-well-a, everybody's
heard about the bird...</i>

01:20:04.049 --> 01:20:05.892
Dad,
can you grab that for me?

01:20:05.968 --> 01:20:08.721
<i>A-well-a, bird, bird,
bird, the bird is the word</i>

01:20:08.804 --> 01:20:11.227
<i>A-well-a, bird, bird, bird
Well, the bird is the word</i>

01:20:11.307 --> 01:20:13.435
<i>A-well-a, bird, bird,
bird, b-bird's the word</i>

01:20:13.517 --> 01:20:15.940
<i>A-well-a, bird, bird, bird
Well, the bird is the word</i>

01:20:16.020 --> 01:20:18.318
<i>A-well-a, bird, bird,
b-bird's the word</i>

01:20:18.397 --> 01:20:20.820
<i>A-well-a, bird, bird,
bird, b-bird's the word</i>

01:20:20.899 --> 01:20:21.991
<i>A-well-a, bird, bird...</i>

01:20:22.067 --> 01:20:23.068
Yeah, yeah, hello.

01:20:23.319 --> 01:20:25.617
Oh, hi.
I'm trying to reach Brad?

01:20:26.113 --> 01:20:27.911
Brad's upstairs.

01:20:27.990 --> 01:20:30.743
He's setting up an oxygen
tank for some old man.

01:20:31.076 --> 01:20:33.545
<i>Oh, can you tell him
his friend Stu called?</i>

01:20:34.079 --> 01:20:37.583
I got word of a great gray owl in the
George Washington National Forest,

01:20:37.666 --> 01:20:39.509
and since that's
in your neck of the woods...

01:20:39.668 --> 01:20:41.841
Yeah, Brad's told me
a lot about you, Stu.

01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:43.012
<i>Same here.</i>

01:20:43.589 --> 01:20:45.591
Quite a son
you have there.

01:20:45.674 --> 01:20:47.927
Between you and me, he might break
the world's record this year.

01:20:49.261 --> 01:20:51.434
World record?
Is that right?

01:20:55.434 --> 01:20:57.152
Here, get your coat on.

01:20:58.062 --> 01:20:59.564
Where are we going?

01:20:59.646 --> 01:21:03.571
Some kind of an owl out in the woods.
I want to get a look at him.

01:21:06.987 --> 01:21:08.079
An owl?

01:21:10.115 --> 01:21:12.743
I always thought it
was kind of weird with birds.

01:21:13.869 --> 01:21:19.046
The male is way colorful and fancy,
and the female is just plain.

01:21:19.792 --> 01:21:21.169
The opposite from us,
you know?

01:21:21.877 --> 01:21:23.379
I don't know, Dad.

01:21:23.462 --> 01:21:25.556
You should check out the
family photo album sometime.

01:21:25.631 --> 01:21:27.975
Those jackets you were sporting
back in the '70s were...

01:21:28.050 --> 01:21:29.393
My sport jacket?

01:21:29.468 --> 01:21:30.811
...Pretty colorful.

01:21:30.886 --> 01:21:33.014
Paisley polyester, huh?
 Yeah.

01:21:33.347 --> 01:21:35.065
How do you think I got
your mother, eh? Huh?

01:21:35.140 --> 01:21:36.813
Uh... I don't think so.

01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:56.286
<i>Jess?</i>

01:22:14.263 --> 01:22:18.268
Frankie?
Is that you?

01:22:21.228 --> 01:22:22.275
No.

01:22:39.455 --> 01:22:40.502
It's not what you think.

01:22:40.581 --> 01:22:41.707
What do I think?

01:22:44.084 --> 01:22:47.054
You know what? The Faluccis
are taking me to a Jets game.

01:22:48.088 --> 01:22:50.261
They wanted to get
an early start.

01:22:50.340 --> 01:22:52.638
And when I heard you come in,
I figured I'd overslept,

01:22:52.718 --> 01:22:55.847
'cause it's not like you've been here
any morning in the last 10 months.

01:22:59.308 --> 01:23:00.810
So you haven't
slept with him.

01:23:01.685 --> 01:23:04.689
No. I'd never
do that to you.

01:23:05.814 --> 01:23:08.658
You know, fallen in
love or something?

01:23:09.860 --> 01:23:10.861
No.

01:23:12.613 --> 01:23:15.913
'Cause, believe it or not,
I'm still in love with you.

01:23:22.039 --> 01:23:24.087
But I can't be
married to you any more.

01:23:26.376 --> 01:23:29.255
Jess...
I'm gonna call Frank

01:23:29.338 --> 01:23:30.715
and tell him that
the game's a no go.

01:23:49.566 --> 01:23:50.818
You okay?

01:23:52.194 --> 01:23:54.196
I'm fine.
Go ahead. Go ahead.

01:24:07.626 --> 01:24:08.627
Brad!

01:24:09.920 --> 01:24:12.548
All right, I want you to get
that bird before it gets dark.

01:24:12.631 --> 01:24:14.429
We will.
No. No, no.

01:24:14.508 --> 01:24:16.135
You go on without me.

01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:18.603
But...
I'll be fine, okay?

01:24:18.679 --> 01:24:20.101
Fine. Give me the tank.

01:24:20.180 --> 01:24:22.524
Come on, come on.
Give me the tank.

01:24:24.393 --> 01:24:25.394
All right.

01:24:26.436 --> 01:24:28.530
Go get that bird.
Go ahead. Go!

01:24:28.605 --> 01:24:29.652
All right.

01:24:32.401 --> 01:24:33.903
Go on!

01:24:36.989 --> 01:24:40.744
Look, you have every reason to be
really upset about the baby thing.

01:24:40.826 --> 01:24:41.873
Yeah. Yeah.
That was terrible.

01:24:41.952 --> 01:24:44.580
I know. I think in the heat of
the moment, I just plain choked,

01:24:44.663 --> 01:24:46.711
but you got to give
someone a second chance.

01:24:46.790 --> 01:24:48.963
No. How can you say
you love me and not

01:24:49.084 --> 01:24:50.586
be willing to try...
Because, Kenny, it's a good thing

01:24:50.669 --> 01:24:52.763
that I wasn't married
to Gandhi or Mozart.

01:24:52.838 --> 01:24:55.387
'Cause I just need to be with
a guy who'd rather be with me

01:24:55.465 --> 01:24:57.012
than with anything else.
Jess, you are. Really.

01:24:57.092 --> 01:24:59.265
Sure. As long as there's no
egret or owl or pelican or...

01:24:59.344 --> 01:25:01.346
No, come on!
Give me a break, Jess!

01:25:01.471 --> 01:25:03.769
Hold it! That's this year, then it's over!
It's every year, Kenny.

01:25:03.849 --> 01:25:04.816
No!
I know you.

01:25:04.891 --> 01:25:06.108
I know that right now
you're in pain,

01:25:06.184 --> 01:25:08.027
trying to think how you're gonna
get on your flight to Phoenix

01:25:08.145 --> 01:25:10.489
without looking like a jerk. No.
No. No, I'm really in pain

01:25:10.564 --> 01:25:13.192
because I really love you, and I'm
scrambling to make this work.

01:25:13.275 --> 01:25:14.993
Enough not to
go to Arizona?

01:25:16.111 --> 01:25:17.579
I have to go to Arizona.

01:25:17.863 --> 01:25:19.365
Why? Why?

01:25:19.448 --> 01:25:21.792
Because right now there's
a guy out there named Stu

01:25:21.867 --> 01:25:25.497
with 730-plus birds, and
if I don't get out there,

01:25:25.579 --> 01:25:28.048
people could say he's the
greatest birder of all time.

01:25:28.123 --> 01:25:29.124
And he's not.

01:25:29.875 --> 01:25:33.505
This is what I'm great at!
This is what I'll be remembered for!

01:25:34.588 --> 01:25:36.807
No one remembers
who comes in second.

01:25:37.716 --> 01:25:40.595
I know. I know.

01:26:10.207 --> 01:26:11.504
What are you doing?

01:26:11.583 --> 01:26:13.335
You idiot, how could you
just leave him there?

01:26:13.418 --> 01:26:14.840
God dang it!

01:26:30.644 --> 01:26:34.899
<i>Of all Earth's creatures,
few fear death as much as man.</i>

01:26:35.774 --> 01:26:36.775
Dad?

01:26:37.401 --> 01:26:41.122
<i>His own, but also
those of his loved ones.</i>

01:26:41.905 --> 01:26:43.782
Dad!

01:26:57.295 --> 01:26:58.421
Dad, are you okay?

01:27:19.025 --> 01:27:21.369
<i>A-well-a, everybody's
heard about the bird</i>

01:27:21.445 --> 01:27:23.243
<i>Bird, bird, bird,
b-bird.</i> . .

01:27:23.321 --> 01:27:24.322
Hello?
Hey, Brad!

01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:31.960
It's me.
There's a Pacific storm coming in.

01:27:32.038 --> 01:27:35.133
<i>A big one! This could turn
it around for us, buddy.</i>

01:27:41.339 --> 01:27:42.886
Huh? What?

01:27:47.804 --> 01:27:49.056
Is today...

01:27:49.723 --> 01:27:51.475
I don't believe it!

01:27:52.684 --> 01:27:53.810
How could you not know?

01:27:53.894 --> 01:27:55.646
Didn't your wife mention
it was Thanksgiving?

01:27:55.729 --> 01:27:58.073
She doesn't like to rub it in
when the holidays roll around

01:27:58.148 --> 01:28:01.027
and she knows I'm in a motel somewhere,
sitting around in my boxers.

01:28:01.234 --> 01:28:02.577
Same thing happened
last Fourth of July.

01:28:02.652 --> 01:28:05.246
Okay, Fourth of July is one
thing, but Thanksgiving!

01:28:05.322 --> 01:28:06.289
Make the next left.

01:28:06.364 --> 01:28:09.789
Hey, Mr. Computer Genius Guy, don't
you have a calendar on that thing?

01:28:09.868 --> 01:28:10.994
Didn't your folks tell you?

01:28:11.077 --> 01:28:13.171
All my dad talks about
is that damn owl.

01:28:16.124 --> 01:28:18.718
Remind me to come over
to your house on Christmas.

01:28:19.044 --> 01:28:21.843
We're trying to catch Bostick,
and you're our only...

01:28:22.672 --> 01:28:24.549
Were you gonna say "hope"?

01:28:28.929 --> 01:28:30.806
That pig's doing
another Big Year?

01:28:33.058 --> 01:28:35.937
<i>It was epic!
Four Siberian species,</i>

01:28:36.019 --> 01:28:38.147
<i>two from China
and one from Japan!</i>

01:28:38.230 --> 01:28:39.447
All right,
so what's your total?

01:28:39.606 --> 01:28:41.734
734, Dad.
Whoo!

01:28:41.817 --> 01:28:44.866
A new record.
I'm gonna kick his ass.

01:28:49.950 --> 01:28:52.044
<i>"Bostick didn't have
his usual cocky air.</i>

01:28:52.118 --> 01:28:54.997
<i>"He was intense,
tired, all-business.</i>

01:28:55.080 --> 01:28:57.549
<i>"Frankly, he looked like a guy
who was trying to catch up. "</i>

01:28:59.084 --> 01:29:00.176
So what do you think?

01:29:00.252 --> 01:29:03.722
He's heard it through the grapevine
that Annie took us out on Thanksgiving.

01:29:03.797 --> 01:29:06.641
Annie made sure of that.
So, yeah, maybe he's scared.

01:29:07.259 --> 01:29:10.684
On the other hand, maybe he's
shooting for some ridiculous number

01:29:10.762 --> 01:29:12.435
and won't slow down
till he gets there.

01:29:12.764 --> 01:29:14.016
What's a ridiculous number?

01:29:14.558 --> 01:29:17.357
740? 745?

01:29:18.103 --> 01:29:19.605
I mean, the guy is crazy!

01:29:21.690 --> 01:29:25.194
<i>Silent night</i>

01:29:25.277 --> 01:29:29.953
<i>Holy night</i>

01:29:30.448 --> 01:29:36.376
<i>All is calm</i>

01:29:37.330 --> 01:29:38.673
Here. Try fork.

01:29:38.748 --> 01:29:40.591
Okay, thank you. Thanks.

01:29:42.252 --> 01:29:46.098
Hey. You want to...
You guys want to come sit with me?

01:29:46.840 --> 01:29:50.890
I feel bad you're working on Christmas.
Come on.

01:29:52.137 --> 01:29:54.640
Why you here?
Why not with family?

01:29:58.894 --> 01:29:59.986
Snowy owl, Chan.

01:30:00.562 --> 01:30:03.236
Been up and down the Sax
Zim Bog looking for him.

01:30:03.315 --> 01:30:06.410
It's the only breeding bird in
North America that's eluded me.

01:30:10.864 --> 01:30:13.333
I'd like to see the
birds of China one day.

01:30:14.492 --> 01:30:15.664
You know anything
about that?

01:30:15.744 --> 01:30:16.916
Peking duck.

01:30:20.332 --> 01:30:21.504
Merry Christmas Eve.

01:30:21.583 --> 01:30:24.177
Merry Christmas.

01:30:38.600 --> 01:30:40.523
Hey, Barry.
Happy holidays.

01:30:40.977 --> 01:30:42.775
You and Jenny in Saint
Barths again this year?

01:30:43.188 --> 01:30:46.158
Not exactly. We all had
to cancel our vacations.

01:30:46.566 --> 01:30:48.159
Looks like we've
been out-shriked.

01:30:48.652 --> 01:30:50.325
<i>We're
being bought by 3M.</i>

01:30:50.403 --> 01:30:51.404
<i>Yeah,
here's the thing, Stu.</i>

01:30:51.821 --> 01:30:53.164
You may want to
sit down for this.

01:30:53.239 --> 01:30:55.708
Looks like Simon Ross
is stepping down as CEO

01:30:55.784 --> 01:30:58.207
and they want you
to take over.

01:30:59.663 --> 01:31:02.086
<i>Stu, you started
this company in your garage.</i>

01:31:02.165 --> 01:31:03.166
<i>You made it
something big.</i>

01:31:03.249 --> 01:31:06.128
<i>Now you have the chance to run one of
the biggest companies in the world.</i>

01:31:06.211 --> 01:31:08.964
<i>It's what they
call a lot of money.</i>

01:31:09.047 --> 01:31:12.927
<i>But more than that, obviously, your
Big Year, it's coming to a close.</i>

01:31:13.009 --> 01:31:14.602
<i>Do you really want
to face the abyss?</i>

01:31:21.559 --> 01:31:23.061
The answer is yes, Jim.

01:31:23.144 --> 01:31:24.145
<i>Yes, you'll do it?</i>

01:31:26.106 --> 01:31:29.110
Yes, I want to
face the abyss.

01:31:29.317 --> 01:31:30.990
No! Stu. Stu. No, no, no, no!
Don't say that!

01:31:31.069 --> 01:31:32.992
Don't say something
you don't mean.

01:31:33.071 --> 01:31:34.414
But I do mean it.

01:31:36.825 --> 01:31:37.826
I really do.

01:31:38.076 --> 01:31:40.829
I think we need to come there and
show you this offer face-to-face.

01:31:40.912 --> 01:31:41.913
Absolutely!

01:31:42.414 --> 01:31:45.918
Can't do it, guys.
Got to help a friend find a bird.

01:31:48.753 --> 01:31:50.255
Those freaking birds!

01:31:51.381 --> 01:31:54.100
Hey, when are you gonna
tell me what we're chasing?

01:31:54.384 --> 01:31:56.011
We're going on
a wild goose chase!

01:31:56.970 --> 01:31:59.314
A goose with
little pink feet.

01:31:59.806 --> 01:32:02.309
You're crazy!
Have you noticed the snow?

01:32:02.475 --> 01:32:03.977
That goose is in
Scotland by now.

01:32:04.060 --> 01:32:05.482
You would think so,
wouldn't you?

01:32:05.562 --> 01:32:08.361
But my friend Jeff Shaw swears
he saw it up here yesterday.

01:32:08.440 --> 01:32:11.444
Just out of curiosity,
what's Jeff Shaw smoking?

01:32:11.693 --> 01:32:13.821
'Cause I'd like to
get me some of that!

01:32:16.448 --> 01:32:19.122
Wait! Wait!
Did you hear that?

01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:20.702
Pink-footed goose.
I heard it!

01:32:20.785 --> 01:32:22.162
Come on!

01:32:26.499 --> 01:32:27.967
There. There.

01:32:28.043 --> 01:32:29.795
Huh? Oh!

01:32:34.215 --> 01:32:37.640
Looks like somebody's found a
warm place to spend the winter.

01:32:38.219 --> 01:32:39.220
Wow.

01:32:40.972 --> 01:32:42.770
What does that give you?

01:32:42.849 --> 01:32:44.647
741!

01:32:47.604 --> 01:32:50.858
That, my friend,
is a very Big Year.

01:32:53.860 --> 01:32:54.861
Hey.

01:33:00.950 --> 01:33:03.419
...five, four,
three, two, one!

01:33:05.622 --> 01:33:07.795
Happy New Year!

01:33:12.128 --> 01:33:13.926
- Hey, look who's here, man!
- Oh, my God, Ray!

01:33:14.005 --> 01:33:15.678
Hey, guys!

01:33:18.093 --> 01:33:22.018
<i>And never brought to mind</i>

01:33:22.680 --> 01:33:27.857
<i>We'll take
a cup of kindness yet</i>

01:33:28.019 --> 01:33:33.025
<i>For auld lang syne</i>

01:33:47.705 --> 01:33:50.049
<i>A-well-a, everybody's
heard about the bird</i>

01:33:50.125 --> 01:33:52.799
<i>Bird, bird, bird,
b-bird's the word...</i>

01:33:53.586 --> 01:33:54.587
Hello?

01:33:58.258 --> 01:33:59.555
Whimbrel.
Yep.

01:34:01.094 --> 01:34:04.143
I just... I just wanted
to say happy New Year.

01:34:04.681 --> 01:34:08.231
Happy New Year to you.
What are you doing?

01:34:09.060 --> 01:34:12.781
Oh, watching TV by myself.

01:34:13.898 --> 01:34:15.150
Darren and I broke up.

01:34:20.530 --> 01:34:22.282
I am so sorry
to hear that.

01:34:24.742 --> 01:34:26.335
<i>Did you just do
a victory dance?</i>

01:34:27.453 --> 01:34:31.253
No.  Maybe.
Yes, I did. <i>I</i> did.

01:34:31.332 --> 01:34:35.257
Well, not a victory dance so
much as a dance of celebration.

01:35:00.486 --> 01:35:02.454
<i>Have you seen the results?</i>

01:35:02.530 --> 01:35:03.531
They're in?

01:35:05.074 --> 01:35:08.044
Okay. Did l win?

01:35:09.621 --> 01:35:11.999
Bostick got 755 birds, Brad.

01:35:12.123 --> 01:35:13.340
No!

01:35:13.416 --> 01:35:14.918
755?

01:35:15.001 --> 01:35:17.129
Son of a bitch!
I... That's...

01:35:19.672 --> 01:35:20.798
That's shocking.

01:35:20.882 --> 01:35:22.350
I know,
it's not quite human.

01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:25.098
But you are second!
How amazing is that?

01:35:25.178 --> 01:35:27.476
A full-time job
and you're second?

01:35:29.098 --> 01:35:30.975
And? You're third?

01:35:31.434 --> 01:35:32.981
Fourth. What can I say?

01:35:33.645 --> 01:35:35.067
I waited
too long to do it.

01:35:35.146 --> 01:35:36.443
<i>No, you didn't.
Don't say that.</i>

01:35:36.522 --> 01:35:38.820
Then you would have done it
some other year.

01:35:38.900 --> 01:35:41.653
And really, we won.

01:35:42.153 --> 01:35:43.154
What do you mean?

01:35:43.571 --> 01:35:45.869
We won, Stu!
I don't know how else to put it.

01:35:46.491 --> 01:35:48.585
<i>I don't just mean I wouldn't have
come in second without you.</i>

01:35:48.660 --> 01:35:49.957
<i>Although that's true</i>

01:35:50.036 --> 01:35:56.043
I mean, I don't know, he got more
birds, but we got more everything.

01:35:57.377 --> 01:35:58.424
Do you know
what I mean?

01:36:02.173 --> 01:36:03.174
Yeah, I do.

01:36:04.217 --> 01:36:07.266
Thank you, Stu.
Have I said thank you?

01:36:07.595 --> 01:36:09.063
Hey, for what?

01:36:10.098 --> 01:36:11.816
Congrats.
Take care, buddy.

01:36:14.852 --> 01:36:15.853
Yep.

01:36:16.729 --> 01:36:18.652
Looks like you'll be
spending the weekend

01:36:18.731 --> 01:36:20.859
with the second best
birder in the world.

01:36:35.415 --> 01:36:36.541
Bostick!

01:36:38.876 --> 01:36:42.346
<i>Eight weeks later,
the ruby-throated hummingbird</i>

01:36:42.422 --> 01:36:45.471
<i>begins her migration
all over again.</i>

01:36:46.217 --> 01:36:49.596
<i>She hopes
it will be uneventful.</i>

01:36:51.806 --> 01:36:53.228
<i>High in the Rockies,</i>

01:36:53.308 --> 01:36:57.404
<i>the retired CEO goes birding
with the future CEO,</i>

01:36:57.478 --> 01:37:00.448
<i>who happily does not
yet know how to count.</i>

01:37:00.857 --> 01:37:02.279
That's a male goldfinch.

01:37:02.358 --> 01:37:05.077
In a couple of months,
it's gonna turn all yellow.

01:37:06.321 --> 01:37:11.077
<i>To celebrate his victory, the
reigning king goes to China.</i>

01:37:17.248 --> 01:37:20.969
<i>Only he knows the price
that he has paid</i>

01:37:21.044 --> 01:37:24.218
<i>to be the greatest birder
in the world.</i>

01:37:27.425 --> 01:37:31.601
<i>The North American programmer
travels to the coast of Maine.</i>

01:37:32.430 --> 01:37:38.688
<i>Though still an avid birder, he at
last has an even greater passion.</i>

01:37:55.828 --> 01:37:59.799
<i>There's a message in the
skies and in the streets</i>

01:37:59.874 --> 01:38:03.720
<i>Opportunity,
the American-y dream</i>

01:38:03.795 --> 01:38:06.548
<i>It's in the radio
It's superstars</i>

01:38:06.631 --> 01:38:10.556
<i>The arteries and veins
that feed your heart</i>

01:38:12.136 --> 01:38:16.061
<i>From the Dairy Queen
to the head of the parade</i>

01:38:16.140 --> 01:38:19.485
<i>In a blink your
life could change</i>

01:38:20.937 --> 01:38:25.937
<i>This could all
be yours someday</i>

01:38:33.324 --> 01:38:38.501

Be yours someday</i>

<i>Into the great unknown,

01:39:11.654 --> 01:39:16.581
<i>Desire and ambition
