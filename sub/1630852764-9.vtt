WEBVTT

00:35.827 --> 00:42.292


01:15.158 --> 01:16.910
To Frances!

01:16.993 --> 01:18.620
What a remarkable soul.

01:18.703 --> 01:21.664
The warmth and strength
she gave to Serenity will stay with us.

01:21.748 --> 01:23.833
I wanna go the way Frances went.

01:24.542 --> 01:25.585
At the bar,

01:26.503 --> 01:27.712
surrounded by friends.

01:27.796 --> 01:29.255
-Mmm.

01:29.339 --> 01:32.509
Oh, and Dana Sue, I hope you'll forgive us
if it takes us a couple of minutes

01:32.592 --> 01:34.552
before we come back
to Sullivan's to drink.

01:34.636 --> 01:35.595
I understand.

01:36.096 --> 01:38.223
I'm just glad
we got to praise Miss Frances

01:38.306 --> 01:39.516
while she was alive to hear it.

01:39.599 --> 01:41.476
And now that she's graduated to glory,

01:41.559 --> 01:44.104
we are gonna throw her
a celebration of life

01:44.187 --> 01:46.064
that will bring joy to everybody.

01:46.147 --> 01:48.483
As dictated by the guest of honor herself.

01:48.566 --> 01:50.610
-Mmm.
-She laid out every detail.

01:50.693 --> 01:52.654
-Of course she did.

01:52.737 --> 01:55.698
Grace and I reviewed the notebook,
and we made copies

01:55.782 --> 01:58.701
of all the duties
that she assigned to each of us.

01:59.202 --> 02:04.082
She asked that I coordinate plans
for her celebration and funeral, and…

02:04.165 --> 02:08.253
I'm handling flowers for church,
graveside, and the celebration.

02:08.336 --> 02:09.170
Mmm.

02:09.254 --> 02:11.339
Frances wants magnolias, of course…

02:12.382 --> 02:13.967
…and Sweet Frances roses.

02:14.050 --> 02:16.302
-Oh.
-There's a rose called Sweet Frances?

02:16.386 --> 02:18.638
Oh yeah, it's a beautiful apricot rose,

02:18.721 --> 02:21.391
prized for its ability
to bloom in drought.

02:21.474 --> 02:23.685
Well, I should create a cocktail
called the Sweet Frances.

02:23.768 --> 02:27.272
-Yes.
-Apricots and, uh, bourbon.

02:27.355 --> 02:29.315
-Mmm.
-And no bitters.

02:29.399 --> 02:30.859
No bitters! Amen.

02:30.942 --> 02:32.026
-Never.

02:32.110 --> 02:35.446
Okay, so I get to create
gifting tables at the celebration

02:35.530 --> 02:37.740
filled with books
from her personal collection.

02:37.824 --> 02:38.658
Mmm.

02:38.741 --> 02:40.827
Those books
were her most prized possessions.

02:40.910 --> 02:41.744
Yeah.

02:41.828 --> 02:45.874
And think of how many people in Serenity
got their love of reading from her.

02:45.957 --> 02:48.168
So we're puttin' all those books out
at the celebration?

02:48.251 --> 02:51.713
"Each guest will get to select
whatever calls to them."

02:52.463 --> 02:56.676
"I trust that each tome
will find its way to its proper new home."

02:56.759 --> 02:57.594
Mmm.

02:57.677 --> 02:59.012
"Leftovers will go to…

03:00.638 --> 03:02.849
…to Little Free Libraries around town."

03:03.349 --> 03:07.395
And there's a list of suggested locations,
and the spa is one of them.

03:07.478 --> 03:08.438
-Aw!

03:08.521 --> 03:11.858
Gettin' someone to build those
is on my list.

03:11.941 --> 03:13.651
Imagine Miss Frances thinking

03:13.735 --> 03:16.779
that you just might know
a bighearted carpenter

03:16.863 --> 03:18.698
who can help us with all of that.

03:18.781 --> 03:21.367
-Are we talking Jesus or Skeeter?
-Neither.

03:23.203 --> 03:25.121
I will ask Ronnie.

03:25.205 --> 03:28.041
And, uh, I would like
to take care of the food.

03:28.124 --> 03:29.083
Ah.

03:29.167 --> 03:33.296
Oh, I talked to Peggy about writing
a… an appreciation for <i>The Sentinel</i>

03:33.379 --> 03:36.090
instead of just
a perfunctory obituary for the newspaper.

03:36.174 --> 03:37.008
-Nice.
-Mm-hmm.

03:37.091 --> 03:40.261
I contacted
Frances's out-of-town family and friends.

03:40.345 --> 03:44.015
Not everyone's sure they can make
the trip, but we'll hope for the best.

03:44.807 --> 03:49.312
And, finally, I will coordinate
with Miss Frances's estate lawyer, so…

03:49.395 --> 03:52.440
Why do you suppose that she gave us
detailed instructions for all this

03:52.523 --> 03:54.359
but nothing about the will?

03:54.442 --> 03:55.443
Because she knew

03:55.526 --> 03:58.613
that the most important things
she left us weren't things.

03:58.696 --> 04:01.574
Her fire lives on
in our most ambitious pursuits.

04:01.658 --> 04:03.534
Like the recall petition.

04:03.618 --> 04:07.956
Which is why we will file it
when Town Hall opens tomorrow morning.

04:08.039 --> 04:08.957
-Oh yes!
-Yes.

04:09.040 --> 04:13.753
The perfect exclamation point
to Miss Frances's extraordinary legacy.

04:15.296 --> 04:16.130
Cheers!

04:21.970 --> 04:24.013
Oh! What a blessing!

04:24.097 --> 04:26.432
I was just about
to seek out the three of you.

04:26.516 --> 04:28.476
Well, what can we do for you?

04:28.559 --> 04:32.313
What I can do for you is deter you
from making a horrible mistake.

04:33.106 --> 04:35.692
My husband is a good man
and doesn't deserve

04:35.775 --> 04:36.943
what you're doing to him.

04:37.026 --> 04:39.279
Well, in that case,
the recall won't be successful.

04:39.362 --> 04:41.322
No, no, no! It shouldn't even begin!

04:42.031 --> 04:44.575
Ladies, let's be honest.
This isn't about Trent.

04:44.659 --> 04:47.120
It's the same ridiculous vendetta
you have against me.

04:48.162 --> 04:50.581
We're not in high school anymore,
Mary Vaughn.

04:50.665 --> 04:53.626
You and your husband
have misappropriated funds and property

04:53.710 --> 04:56.963
to enrich yourselves.
You both need to be held accountable.

04:57.046 --> 04:59.132
Follow through with this misguided plan,

04:59.841 --> 05:01.467
and there will be consequences.

05:01.551 --> 05:04.387
And if we turned a blind eye
to your malfeasance,

05:04.470 --> 05:07.098
there'll be dire consequences
for this entire town.

05:07.682 --> 05:10.852
Well, now if you'll excuse us,
we have a petition to file.

05:21.654 --> 05:24.365
You can only progress
once you've gathered all five seals.

05:24.449 --> 05:26.451
How does the enchanter
fit into that quest?

05:26.534 --> 05:28.661
And does the halfling summon the guardian?

05:28.745 --> 05:30.288
-Tournament!

05:30.371 --> 05:33.708
The gates can only be opened
once the grand champion is defeated.

05:33.791 --> 05:36.127
Even then, we need another obstacle
to the kingdom.

05:36.210 --> 05:37.337
Right.

05:37.420 --> 05:40.465
Maybe the water hag
can summon an elemental companion!

05:42.633 --> 05:44.469
Water hags don't exist in this region.

05:45.261 --> 05:46.220
Oh.

05:46.763 --> 05:48.306
Right. Yeah.

05:50.975 --> 05:53.269
But if it's a cave hag
who summons the elemental--

05:53.353 --> 05:56.105
-Then it's sand and stone, and we're good!
-Wicked idea, Kyle.

05:56.189 --> 05:57.148
Super cool.

05:57.231 --> 05:59.192
It's Nellie's idea. I just built on it.

05:59.942 --> 06:03.154
Can we have a fake-out before
the second stage of the cave hag fight?

06:11.204 --> 06:13.164
-You know what? Listen, Peter Pan.
-Don't!

06:13.247 --> 06:15.875
You don't get credit
for leaving Neverland at 40 years old.

06:15.958 --> 06:17.710
My God-- You didn't want me to change!

06:17.794 --> 06:20.296
Oh wow! That's ridiculous!

06:20.380 --> 06:23.257
Uh, it's true.
You liked the power imbalance.

06:23.341 --> 06:27.512
Oh, there you go again,
laying your shortcomings at my doorstep.

06:27.595 --> 06:30.932
-Oh.
-Again, let's focus on a way forward.

06:31.015 --> 06:32.809
-Not what's behind us.

06:32.892 --> 06:35.395
Both of you, take a breath.

06:36.437 --> 06:39.148
Now, you came to me in faith

06:39.232 --> 06:42.610
with the singular goal
of saving your marriage.

06:43.194 --> 06:47.365
Focus on that unity of purpose
and your good intent.

06:48.408 --> 06:51.452
Now, did you complete my first request?

07:00.128 --> 07:03.339
Couldn't be bothered to bring your vows
like Pastor June asked, huh?

07:07.885 --> 07:09.429
My darling Dana Sue.

07:11.431 --> 07:12.348
You're kind,

07:13.141 --> 07:15.059
smart, funny…

07:16.853 --> 07:18.020
…and beautiful.

07:19.730 --> 07:23.192
You know your way
around a kitchen, a classic car,

07:24.318 --> 07:25.236
and my heart.

07:25.736 --> 07:31.451
You can cure any ill
with great food and a killer smile.

07:32.910 --> 07:35.121
I'll build our house. Be your rock.

07:36.164 --> 07:39.292
I cherish everything you are,

07:39.375 --> 07:42.879
and I promise
to treasure everything that you'll become.

07:44.172 --> 07:46.632
And I vow before God

07:48.092 --> 07:49.677
and our favorite folks

07:51.345 --> 07:53.181
to love you forever.

07:57.185 --> 07:58.269
Thank you, Ronnie.

07:59.854 --> 08:01.772
Do you wanna share your vows, Dana Sue?

08:13.409 --> 08:15.661
Well, until next time,

08:15.745 --> 08:19.332
I would like for you both to consider

08:19.415 --> 08:24.212
the sacred promises
that you made to each other <i>and</i> to God.

08:24.795 --> 08:27.798
And do your vows still mean
the same thing to you today…

08:38.309 --> 08:40.645
All right, well, we harvested four eggs.

08:46.651 --> 08:49.570
I ate well. I, uh… I did yoga.

08:50.655 --> 08:53.950
I avoided chemicals.
I took all of my medication.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.744
Even those supplements.

08:56.827 --> 08:59.497
You were remarkably diligent,
as I expected you would be.

08:59.580 --> 09:02.166
-Did I do this wrong?
-You did everything within--

09:02.250 --> 09:04.502
Not just this. I mean all of it.

09:05.336 --> 09:07.547
Every decision that brought me here.

09:07.630 --> 09:08.714
Waiting until now,

09:08.798 --> 09:11.008
ig… ignoring the urges to be a mother.

09:16.138 --> 09:17.848
Did I lose my chance?

09:19.725 --> 09:20.601
Did I…

09:21.519 --> 09:23.104
did I waste my moment?

09:26.566 --> 09:28.192
It… it's been my experience

09:28.276 --> 09:32.697
that focusing on the road not taken
keeps you from getting anywhere.

09:33.322 --> 09:35.700
But for the sake
of this moment's conversation,

09:35.783 --> 09:37.827
are there aspects of your current life

09:37.910 --> 09:40.830
you would forfeit
for a hypothetical child?

09:46.210 --> 09:47.628
-No.
-Remember that.

09:48.838 --> 09:51.382
Also, think of this process as a…

09:52.258 --> 09:54.135
an experience with unexpected gifts.

09:55.595 --> 09:58.973
They may surprise you by revealing
strengths you didn't even know you had.

09:59.056 --> 09:59.890
Yeah, such as?

09:59.974 --> 10:02.977
Embracing the inability
to control everything.

10:04.103 --> 10:05.229
Sometimes anything.

10:05.313 --> 10:08.983
Dr. Ringle, that gift
has never had my name on it.

10:09.066 --> 10:10.026
Stay hopeful.

10:10.109 --> 10:13.446
You have four eggs, and you only need one
for your ultimate success.

10:16.198 --> 10:17.825
-It only takes one.
-Mmm.

10:31.005 --> 10:33.090
-Good evening, Miss Sullivan.
-Jackson.

10:34.508 --> 10:35.801
Hi, Annie.

10:36.427 --> 10:38.179
-Hey.
-Wow!

10:40.139 --> 10:42.433
Thanks, Jackson. They're beautiful.

10:42.516 --> 10:43.476
You're welcome.

10:45.686 --> 10:47.521
I'll put 'em in water for you.

10:48.814 --> 10:52.902
I'll make sure to have her back by curfew,
ma'am. You have a wonderful evening.

11:02.036 --> 11:03.371
Y'all do the same.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.089
-Mmm.

11:14.256 --> 11:17.301
-Well, <i>that</i> gives happy hour new meaning.

11:20.012 --> 11:21.138
Mmm.

11:23.766 --> 11:25.559
-Hmm.

11:35.194 --> 11:37.863
Actually, uh, could you grab me a T-shirt?

11:37.947 --> 11:40.074
Mmm. After that, I'll do anything you ask.

11:41.033 --> 11:41.951
Mmm.

11:43.369 --> 11:45.913
Oh! You have a memory drawer too?

11:45.996 --> 11:48.165
Oh gosh, no!

11:48.249 --> 11:50.334
You know, sometimes I forget

11:50.418 --> 11:52.795
that you had a life
before you came to Serenity.

11:52.878 --> 11:53.713
Ah…

11:53.796 --> 11:57.466
Wait, you went to the ESPYs?
I watch this every year with Ty.

11:57.550 --> 11:59.343
I always cry at the Jimmy V Award.

12:00.052 --> 12:01.095
As do I.

12:01.178 --> 12:03.681
But heads up,
the T-shirts are one drawer down.

12:03.764 --> 12:05.349
Yeah, but this is way more fun.

12:05.433 --> 12:06.434
Hmm.

12:12.314 --> 12:13.315
There's a story.

12:14.650 --> 12:15.609
An explanation.

12:15.693 --> 12:16.986
Wanna share?

12:17.069 --> 12:18.279
Well, I keep that

12:19.363 --> 12:23.617
as a reminder that it takes two people
to screw up a relationship.

12:25.077 --> 12:27.496
Victoria and I
were both all-stars in that sport.

12:29.123 --> 12:30.040
A wise man

12:31.375 --> 12:32.543
once told me

12:33.961 --> 12:36.756
that true forgiveness only happens

12:36.839 --> 12:40.801
when the pain of past relationships
isn't the first thing that you think of

12:40.885 --> 12:42.344
when you wake up in the morning.

12:42.970 --> 12:45.181
I hope that you get that one day soon.

12:53.439 --> 12:55.691
That morning, my love,

12:56.275 --> 12:57.276
has already come.

12:59.779 --> 13:03.616
What I'm looking forward to is the morning
I can wake up with you in my arms.

13:19.924 --> 13:22.676
I never thought
a stack of paper could make me so happy.

13:24.011 --> 13:24.929
Well, enjoy it.

13:25.012 --> 13:27.264
We spoke to neighbors,
we researched the law,

13:27.348 --> 13:28.766
we gathered signatures,

13:28.849 --> 13:30.893
we nailed down every requirement

13:30.976 --> 13:33.604
so that the petition
couldn't be bounced out on a technicality,

13:33.687 --> 13:35.898
and now… now that it's all filed, it…

13:36.607 --> 13:38.734
it just… it just feels like minutes.

13:38.818 --> 13:39.652
Yeah.

13:39.735 --> 13:41.821
The good times always go so fast.

13:41.904 --> 13:46.700
As Miss Frances said in her notebook,
"The speed of life will surprise you,

13:46.784 --> 13:50.871
and so will your ability
to remember the sweetest moments."

13:50.955 --> 13:55.167
-We should put that in her program.
-She thought of that. And we are.

13:56.794 --> 14:00.381
All of her final wishes
are falling into place nicely.

14:00.881 --> 14:03.133
Well, part of me
still can't believe she's gone.

14:03.217 --> 14:04.093
I know.

14:04.176 --> 14:07.471
-I'm gonna miss her something fierce.
-Yeah, we all will.

14:08.013 --> 14:11.141
But she'll continue
to walk with us and motivate us.

14:11.225 --> 14:14.562
Standing up to Mary Vaughn
is proof of what we've learned.

14:14.645 --> 14:17.898
-Would she cower in front of a bully?
-Only while pigs are flying.

14:17.982 --> 14:19.733
-Neither will we.
-Mm-hmm. Let's go.

14:19.817 --> 14:21.777
Mmm.

14:22.403 --> 14:24.154
-Let's go sit down, ladies.
-Mmm.

14:24.238 --> 14:25.489
-Ooh, that's good tonight.
-Yeah.

14:25.573 --> 14:26.532
Maddie,

14:27.116 --> 14:30.369
how is Cal handling
being <i>in love</i> with an activist?

14:30.452 --> 14:32.121
-Oh!

14:32.204 --> 14:34.039
If I'm being honest,

14:34.123 --> 14:36.834
it's kinda thrilling
to be with a man that,

14:37.418 --> 14:39.753
I don't know, supports me.

14:39.837 --> 14:41.589
My passion, my vision.

14:41.672 --> 14:42.756
Hmm!

14:44.174 --> 14:47.928
So that's where that little rosy glow
and the big smile come from.

14:48.012 --> 14:49.763
Intellectual rapport.

14:49.847 --> 14:51.765
-Mmm.

14:51.849 --> 14:55.185
Ugh. When I was sitting there,
watching Bill walk out…

14:55.269 --> 14:56.437
Mmm.

14:56.520 --> 14:59.523
…if you asked me, "Maddie,
where are you gonna be next summer?" I…

15:00.274 --> 15:02.484
I could not have imagined
that this was possible.

15:02.568 --> 15:05.362
And all of the peaks
and valleys in between.

15:05.446 --> 15:08.198
I'm living proof
that sorrow can turn to joy.

15:08.282 --> 15:09.241
Hmm.

15:09.867 --> 15:11.327
You give me hope.

15:12.328 --> 15:13.412
How's counseling?

15:14.496 --> 15:15.331
It's…

15:16.248 --> 15:17.082
it's going.

15:17.958 --> 15:19.501
I mean, June is wonderful.

15:20.252 --> 15:21.170
You and Ronnie?

15:21.670 --> 15:23.964
Pushing ourselves to the brink
to try and get it right.

15:24.048 --> 15:27.009
But you… you both still want this?

15:27.092 --> 15:29.386
Oh yeah, I can't tell you how much.

15:30.888 --> 15:33.724
It's just… it's just a whole lot harder
than I thought it was gonna be.

15:35.059 --> 15:37.645
Come on over here
and preach to the choir, Dana Sue.

15:38.771 --> 15:42.107
-Not you and Erik?
-No. Me and my doctor.

15:42.191 --> 15:44.610
Oh. That's right.
How was your appointment?

15:45.361 --> 15:48.447
If you were to ask me
where I wanna be next summer,

15:48.530 --> 15:51.158
I'd say sitting in Town Square,

15:51.241 --> 15:53.994
soaking up the sun, holding my baby.

15:57.873 --> 16:00.501
What if I'm the next Miss Frances, hmm?

16:01.043 --> 16:05.089
Devoted to the community but alone.

16:05.172 --> 16:07.091
Okay. Hold on one hot second.

16:07.174 --> 16:11.470
You <i>have</i> never nor will you ever <i>be </i>alone.

16:12.680 --> 16:15.099
Hey, listen. We know you want a baby,

16:15.182 --> 16:17.977
and we support you
however you choose to have that child,

16:18.060 --> 16:19.520
but in the meantime,

16:20.187 --> 16:22.439
remember all the lives you have changed.

16:22.523 --> 16:24.608
As a lawyer, a town leader,

16:24.692 --> 16:26.026
a godmother.

16:26.110 --> 16:27.069
A friend.

16:27.152 --> 16:30.698
Uh, we have a reputation to uphold, missy.

16:30.781 --> 16:32.116
-Yes, we do.

16:32.199 --> 16:34.326
We are the sweet girls
whose dreams blossom.

16:34.410 --> 16:35.828
-Oh yes.
-Yeah.

16:36.954 --> 16:38.706
-To Miss Frances.
-Yeah.

16:39.289 --> 16:40.499
And that lemonade stand.

16:41.625 --> 16:44.878
And all of the good things
that have been poured out since.

16:49.633 --> 16:50.509
Don't feel bad.

16:50.592 --> 16:53.470
I have been family Putt-Putt champion
three years running.

16:54.054 --> 16:55.973
You didn't think
that was key info to share

16:56.056 --> 16:59.435
when I invited you out for miniature golf?

17:00.352 --> 17:01.395
Surprise?

17:02.062 --> 17:05.691
I demand a rematch.
I won't be foiled by the windmill again.

17:05.774 --> 17:08.277
Okay, I'll put my crown on the line.

17:16.577 --> 17:18.120
Thanks for a great night.

17:18.203 --> 17:20.330
You're the reason it was so much fun.

17:29.006 --> 17:31.133
I'm glad I gave you a second chance.

17:31.967 --> 17:33.594
And got to know you better.

17:34.219 --> 17:37.639
I gotta ask. What finally won you over?

17:37.723 --> 17:39.266
The origami camera?

17:39.349 --> 17:40.601
No.

17:42.436 --> 17:45.064
You were willing to show me
who you really are.

18:02.539 --> 18:03.540
Mary Vaughn?

18:03.624 --> 18:07.169
I am hard-pressed to describe
the depths of my disappointment.

18:07.252 --> 18:11.548
You and your Not-So-Sweet Magnolias
stupidly went through with your ambush.

18:11.632 --> 18:13.592
An ambush is secret.

18:13.675 --> 18:16.804
We told you
exactly what we were doing and why.

18:16.887 --> 18:18.263
The people have spoken.

18:18.347 --> 18:20.849
After they were confused
by your exaggerations and lies.

18:20.933 --> 18:22.601
And how many of those signatures

18:22.684 --> 18:25.437
have real people,
<i>actual</i> registered voters, attached?

18:25.521 --> 18:28.023
We'll leave that
for the town clerk to verify.

18:28.524 --> 18:30.984
The town charter
gives her 48 hours to do so.

18:31.068 --> 18:34.738
Which means you still have time
to withdraw your petition.

18:34.822 --> 18:36.949
You would be wise to do so.

18:37.032 --> 18:39.535
Let me give that proposal
the same consideration

18:39.618 --> 18:42.913
that you and your husband
have given the citizens of Serenity.

18:43.705 --> 18:44.540
No.

18:45.165 --> 18:46.834
Shortsighted and foolhardy.

18:50.879 --> 18:52.047
Don't forget,

18:52.631 --> 18:54.883
I hold Cal's fate in my hands.

18:58.679 --> 19:00.097
I'm sorry, I'm running late.

19:00.889 --> 19:04.393
And if your boss can't be
a little flexible with your lunch break,

19:04.476 --> 19:06.687
I'd be happy to talk to her, Erik.

19:09.022 --> 19:11.525
Just… just let me deal with
whoever's at the door,

19:11.608 --> 19:14.027
and I'll be on my way. Hold on. Come in!

19:15.279 --> 19:16.321
Yeah.

19:16.405 --> 19:19.158
-Okay. I'll be right there. Okay, bye.

19:20.325 --> 19:21.201
Right.

19:23.745 --> 19:24.580
Helen.

19:26.748 --> 19:27.583
Ryan.

19:28.375 --> 19:29.751
I'm sorry I didn't call first.

19:29.835 --> 19:32.212
I can feel Aunt Frances
wagging a finger from heaven.

19:33.630 --> 19:34.882
I'm…

19:34.965 --> 19:37.801
I'm so sorry for your loss.

19:37.885 --> 19:39.386
For Serenity's loss.

19:39.928 --> 19:42.139
-Do you have a moment?
-Uh, only a moment.

19:42.222 --> 19:44.349
-I'm on my way out.
-I went by your office.

19:44.433 --> 19:45.434
I made some changes.

19:46.018 --> 19:47.978
-I hope you've been well.
-Ryan.

19:48.562 --> 19:50.981
-I mean it.
-What can I do for you?

19:51.064 --> 19:53.775
I came to talk through
the service and celebration.

19:54.651 --> 19:56.820
Of course. Of course. Um…

19:57.654 --> 19:58.739
Wh… when?

19:59.406 --> 20:03.118
Well, you tell me. You Magnolias are doing
such a wonderful job with the planning,

20:03.202 --> 20:07.748
I feel like I don't have much to do
except talk to Peggy.

20:09.333 --> 20:12.085
Peg… Peggy's not helping
with the arrangements.

20:12.169 --> 20:13.837
Why does she need to talk to you?

20:18.050 --> 20:21.762
Well, um… I'll… I'll call you.

20:21.845 --> 20:24.932
Yes, I should, um, check in
to the B and B and get some sleep.

20:25.474 --> 20:27.893
Getting back came at the cost
of two cramped bus rides

20:27.976 --> 20:29.061
and a brutal red-eye.

20:33.649 --> 20:34.733
It's good to see you.

20:49.581 --> 20:53.293
So the boys are bringing
Miss Frances's books over from her place,

20:53.377 --> 20:57.005
and Dana Sue successfully enlisted Ronnie
to make the Little Free Libraries.

20:57.089 --> 20:59.591
Oh, well, I'm glad
those two are talking again.

20:59.675 --> 21:01.385
Oh, they're doing more than just talking.

21:02.010 --> 21:04.137
-Even better.
-Mm-hmm.

21:04.846 --> 21:08.267
Okay, so I've arranged
the organist for the funeral,

21:08.350 --> 21:12.604
the vocalist for the interment,
and the bluegrass band for the party.

21:12.688 --> 21:15.274
Oh, and I made sure that they know
"Angel From Montgomery,"

21:15.357 --> 21:20.904
because Frances had a crush on John Prine
that bordered on the indecent, and…

21:22.990 --> 21:24.032
Oh…

21:24.908 --> 21:25.742
Mama.

21:27.411 --> 21:28.578
How are <i>you</i> doing?

21:29.454 --> 21:30.414
Hmm.

21:31.373 --> 21:34.209
Oh, darling, I… I miss my friend.

21:35.294 --> 21:38.505
But she is in a glorious place.

21:38.588 --> 21:39.715
-Mm-hmm.
-Mmm.

21:40.299 --> 21:44.886
And I have a… a certain peace
in the wonderful memories we created.

21:47.014 --> 21:47.973
Whenever we saw…

21:48.056 --> 21:51.143
Whenever we saw each other,
we'd say, "Do you remember when…"

21:53.061 --> 21:55.188
Even though, of course, we always did.

21:57.983 --> 22:01.778
When you've been friends over the decades,
those stories become a, um…

22:01.862 --> 22:04.781
a connection to your truth.

22:05.907 --> 22:08.660
A reminder of who you were

22:09.828 --> 22:11.330
and how you became who you are.

22:13.957 --> 22:18.337
Revising my own final plans
to replace Frances is hard.

22:19.463 --> 22:21.506
I always thought
she'd outlive us all.

22:22.299 --> 22:23.300
Wait.

22:23.383 --> 22:25.177
You have a notebook?

22:25.260 --> 22:27.220
No, no, I have a strongbox.

22:28.013 --> 22:30.140
You should have your affairs in order too.

22:30.223 --> 22:33.810
I mean, certainly, Helen told you
to revise your will when you got divorced?

22:33.894 --> 22:34.770
That is different.

22:34.853 --> 22:37.689
You know, I have to make sure
the kids are taken care of.

22:39.566 --> 22:40.901
I have people

22:41.735 --> 22:43.320
to take care of too.

22:44.446 --> 22:47.366
So, my strongbox
is on the third shelf of the linen closet,

22:47.449 --> 22:49.493
and the combination is your birthday.

22:49.576 --> 22:51.161
And I told Helen all of this,

22:51.244 --> 22:53.413
so you don't have to fret
about remembering.

22:53.497 --> 22:56.625
I just want everything
to be as worry-free as possible for you.

22:57.125 --> 22:58.168
I can't.

23:01.463 --> 23:02.714
I won't…

23:05.467 --> 23:07.427
think about your not being with us.

23:07.928 --> 23:11.765
Which is why
I discussed everything with Helen.

23:13.517 --> 23:15.560
It's not just that you're my mama,

23:16.853 --> 23:18.605
and I love you more than I can say.

23:19.189 --> 23:20.857
I talk to you every day.

23:20.941 --> 23:24.528
You are my living example of dreaming big
and thinking creatively

23:24.611 --> 23:28.615
and… …disregarding all the dirt
in Serenity's rumor mill.

23:31.076 --> 23:33.620
I would not have gotten through
my divorce without you.

23:33.703 --> 23:34.788
Oh…

23:34.871 --> 23:38.083
And Ty and Kyle and Katie, they adore you.

23:40.710 --> 23:42.838
Mama, you're at the center of this family.

23:42.921 --> 23:43.922
Sweet girl.

23:45.132 --> 23:49.386
Just because I have a plan
doesn't mean I'm in a hurry to leave.

23:51.513 --> 23:52.764
And when I do go,

23:53.390 --> 23:57.018
I will be your biggest fan for eternity.

23:57.894 --> 24:01.022
I will always be a voice in your ear

24:01.857 --> 24:03.483
and a beat in your heart.

24:16.288 --> 24:18.457
I… I knew you'd be a great parent
by the patience

24:18.540 --> 24:20.459
and compassion you showed our patients.

24:20.542 --> 24:23.920
Well, I just wanted them
to get back to their best selves.

24:24.004 --> 24:24.880
Here.

24:24.963 --> 24:26.506
Which is why I stopped by.

24:27.716 --> 24:31.470
I have a favor to ask,
and I know, with Rebecca, it's a big one.

24:32.679 --> 24:35.640
I didn't wanna put you on the spot
in front of Bill yesterday at the checkup.

24:35.724 --> 24:37.934
I appreciate that, Howie.

24:38.018 --> 24:41.521
And I appreciate how kind
and gracious you've always been to me.

24:41.605 --> 24:45.901
Even after the mess
Bill and I made at the practice.

24:45.984 --> 24:47.694
Life's messy, Noreen,

24:47.777 --> 24:49.905
but you can always count on me
as a friend.

24:51.156 --> 24:52.073
Likewise.

24:52.574 --> 24:53.950
So ask away.

24:54.451 --> 24:57.829
Well, Collins Littlefield
just had hernia surgery.

24:57.913 --> 24:59.080
He's laid up at his house

24:59.164 --> 25:01.708
and needs someone
to look after him for a couple days.

25:01.791 --> 25:03.835
Frankly, it's less about nursing

25:03.919 --> 25:06.296
and more about
making sure he behaves while he heals.

25:06.379 --> 25:07.506
I can imagine.

25:07.589 --> 25:10.133
He and Miss Frances
were in a senior circle.

25:10.217 --> 25:11.927
They all check in on each other.

25:12.552 --> 25:15.931
Miss Frances would call
or swing by every morning.

25:16.014 --> 25:17.265
That's beautiful.

25:17.349 --> 25:18.892
He's taking her loss hard.

25:19.768 --> 25:21.269
Collins wouldn't say so,

25:21.811 --> 25:23.813
but the daily company
might do him some good.

25:23.897 --> 25:26.399
And I think he'd be more open
to an arrangement

25:26.483 --> 25:28.193
if it's someone that he likes…

25:28.276 --> 25:30.570
-…and her sweet baby.

25:33.990 --> 25:35.659
No need for flattery, Howie.

25:36.243 --> 25:39.538
Serenity's my home now.
Neighbors look out for each other.

25:40.830 --> 25:43.583
I'm sorry
this is what brought you home,

25:43.667 --> 25:45.627
but it is good to have you back.

25:46.711 --> 25:48.380
I'm not clear why you asked me to stop by.

25:48.463 --> 25:53.510
Well, I wanted to discuss
your, uh… your level of comfort

25:53.593 --> 25:56.555
in having <i>The</i> <i>Sentinel </i>report
on the events surrounding

25:56.638 --> 25:57.764
your aunt's funeral.

25:57.847 --> 26:00.934
I'm writing an appreciation,
but it doesn't seem enough.

26:01.017 --> 26:03.019
Everyone loved her so much.

26:03.603 --> 26:04.896
Aunt Frances always said

26:05.438 --> 26:08.066
she wanted to be remembered
by the people she helped.

26:08.567 --> 26:10.652
-Not by the people who were watching.

26:10.735 --> 26:13.321
I'm sure your appreciation
will be lovely and sufficient.

26:13.405 --> 26:16.074
I appreciate that.
Is there a favorite picture

26:16.157 --> 26:18.034
that you would like
for us to run with the piece?

26:18.118 --> 26:20.996
The one that was in the yearbook
the last few years she taught.

26:21.079 --> 26:24.541
-I'm fairly sure I have a digital copy.
-Well, here.

26:25.625 --> 26:27.711
You can email or text it to me.

26:27.794 --> 26:30.880
I don't mean to drag you back over here
when you have so much to do.

26:30.964 --> 26:32.007
Not a problem.

26:34.217 --> 26:36.094
-It's good to see you.
-You too.

26:38.179 --> 26:39.014
Hey, Ry.

26:39.639 --> 26:41.433
Um, will you be staying a bit?

26:41.933 --> 26:43.518
It'd be nice to talk to you again.

26:44.477 --> 26:47.480
Maybe do an article
on everything you've been up to.

26:47.564 --> 26:51.067
Depends on whether
there's something worth staying for.

26:52.485 --> 26:53.695
I will let you know.

27:00.493 --> 27:03.246
Okay. I've got the vases.
I'm gonna head out.

27:03.330 --> 27:04.664
Thank you, sweetheart.

27:07.000 --> 27:10.837
Before I go, um,
I just got the most amazing invite.

27:11.963 --> 27:14.049
Next weekend,
I don't have a shift at the restaurant.

27:14.132 --> 27:18.345
I'll have finished one of my summer books,
I got my highest grades <i>yet</i> last quarter,

27:18.428 --> 27:21.348
and I'll stream Sunday service online
instead of being there in person.

27:22.140 --> 27:23.600
And this allows you to…

27:23.683 --> 27:26.978
Go with Lily to her parents' lake house
for the weekend. Please?

27:28.521 --> 27:29.898
Who else is gonna be there?

27:29.981 --> 27:30.857
Lily's mom.

27:31.650 --> 27:32.734
The whole time?

27:32.817 --> 27:33.777
Most of it.

27:35.820 --> 27:37.197
Thank you for explaining.

27:37.280 --> 27:39.574
-It sounds really exciting.
-Is that a yes?

27:39.658 --> 27:42.202
But I don't know Lily that well,

27:42.285 --> 27:44.204
and I don't know her mother at all.

27:44.287 --> 27:46.831
So this has to be a no.

27:50.210 --> 27:52.003
Okay. Just thought I'd ask.

27:52.087 --> 27:53.171
I'll be back soon.

28:14.234 --> 28:15.318
Oh, hey.

28:15.402 --> 28:17.612
That was beautiful. Did you write that?

28:17.696 --> 28:20.115
Uh, yeah.
If only you didn't sound so surprised.

28:21.116 --> 28:22.450
I didn't mean to.

28:22.534 --> 28:24.536
I remember when
you used to play guitar all the time,

28:24.619 --> 28:26.371
and it's great you're playing again.

28:26.454 --> 28:28.832
Uh, yeah, I'm a little rusty,
but it's coming back to me.

28:32.877 --> 28:35.880
Uh, these are from my mom.
Bud vases for your mom and grandma

28:35.964 --> 28:37.882
for the celebration for Miss Frances.

28:38.717 --> 28:40.510
-Well, thanks for bringing them by.
-Happy to.

28:40.593 --> 28:43.304
I might not have gotten a chance
to hear the song otherwise.

28:43.388 --> 28:45.432
I would've found another way
to inflict it on you.

28:52.439 --> 28:55.984
Whoa, that's… awesome?

28:56.067 --> 28:58.027
Ridiculous. But awesome.

28:58.111 --> 28:59.738
Cool. Can you play paparazzi for a minute?

28:59.821 --> 29:02.532
Dude, there's an actual photographer
right in front of you.

29:03.158 --> 29:04.826
-Would you mind?
-Not at all.

29:04.909 --> 29:06.286
I just wish I had my camera.

29:11.708 --> 29:14.335
Do I even <i>want</i> to know
why you're dressed like this?

29:14.961 --> 29:17.255
Kyle and his friends
are making this really cool game,

29:17.338 --> 29:20.216
but that might not be
the reason why he's dressed like that.

29:20.300 --> 29:22.010
-Ha-ha.

29:22.093 --> 29:24.345
No, we're meeting up tomorrow
to discuss the villain's arc,

29:24.429 --> 29:26.306
and I want them to have this visual.

29:27.223 --> 29:30.059
So you raided
your and Katie's costume closet

29:30.143 --> 29:31.186
and my sports stash.

29:31.269 --> 29:33.146
Hey, creativity knows no boundaries.

29:33.229 --> 29:37.066
Well, if the game is half as wild
as this costume, it'll be a huge hit.

29:37.150 --> 29:39.319
Yeah. She's right. A huge hit!

29:41.613 --> 29:44.866
It's wonderful to see you two on the mend.

29:45.784 --> 29:47.035
It's wonderful to see you.

29:48.286 --> 29:49.454
Uh, he's right.

29:50.079 --> 29:51.122
It is.

29:52.832 --> 29:53.666
Agreed.

29:54.626 --> 29:55.960
So see you soon?

30:00.048 --> 30:02.425
-When do I get to hear the song?
-When do I get to play the game?

30:02.509 --> 30:05.094
Ah! Respect to my fellow artiste.

30:07.639 --> 30:09.349
Do you know what this character needs?

30:10.016 --> 30:12.060
-Spiked hair.
-Really?

30:12.143 --> 30:14.979
Yeah. I… I have some wax left over
from that stupid Spirit Week

30:15.063 --> 30:16.898
when the whole team did it.
Wanna give it a try?

30:16.981 --> 30:18.650
-Sure.
-All right.

30:20.276 --> 30:21.611
What was that? Whoa! Hey, you…

30:25.782 --> 30:29.953
Look at me, getting to walk
the prettiest girl in town home.

30:30.578 --> 30:34.040
You know, if you had schoolbooks,
I'd carry them to lighten your load.

30:34.123 --> 30:37.585
Yeah. Would you put your letterman jacket
around my shoulders too?

30:37.669 --> 30:39.462
-Complete with captain's pin.

30:40.171 --> 30:42.841
So, how was homeroom today?

30:43.675 --> 30:47.387
Funny enough, same bully,
then <i>and</i> now, came up to me.

30:47.929 --> 30:49.556
Mary Vaughn.

30:49.639 --> 30:55.061
She warned me, again,
about not being happy about the petition,

30:55.687 --> 30:59.524
and she threatened me, again,
about something bad happening to you

31:00.233 --> 31:01.734
if we don't stand down.

31:04.779 --> 31:06.865
This is all about Jackson.

31:06.948 --> 31:10.034
I mean, if I have to cut
that boy's meat into bite-size pieces

31:10.118 --> 31:12.036
while I serve him off of a silver platter,

31:12.120 --> 31:13.830
that cannot stop you and your friends

31:13.913 --> 31:15.748
from the good work
you are doing for Serenity.

31:15.832 --> 31:18.084
But I don't want you
to be collateral damage.

31:18.167 --> 31:19.669
As Harriet Beecher Stowe said,

31:20.211 --> 31:21.421
"Never give up,

31:21.504 --> 31:24.257
for that is just the place and time
the tide will turn."

31:25.091 --> 31:26.509
So you don't stop,

31:26.593 --> 31:29.095
and I will be by your side the entire way.

31:31.139 --> 31:33.600
Literally side by side?

31:36.811 --> 31:37.854
The entire way.

31:49.324 --> 31:52.410
Okay, your strength makes me feel safe.

31:52.493 --> 31:55.872
Your… confidence elevates mine.

31:56.956 --> 31:59.083
Your presence alone…

32:01.878 --> 32:03.504
Your presence alone…

32:03.588 --> 32:06.257
Your presence alone can set my world right
when it falls off its axis!

32:06.341 --> 32:09.302
-Your presence alone can set…

32:09.385 --> 32:12.805
Can s… can set my world right…

32:12.889 --> 32:17.060
Your presence alone
can set my world right when it falls…

32:17.685 --> 32:18.895
-Hi.
-Hi.

32:18.978 --> 32:22.565
Okay, so I have thought about
what my vows mean,

32:22.649 --> 32:24.901
and I'm ready to talk through them.

32:25.485 --> 32:26.319
You ready?

32:26.402 --> 32:30.031
Yeah. I don't understand
why you can so easily remember your vows,

32:30.114 --> 32:31.824
and it is so hard for me.

32:32.450 --> 32:34.577
Babe, it's not a competition.

32:34.661 --> 32:35.787
I know that.

32:36.287 --> 32:40.833
What I don't know
is why I just can't do it!

32:40.917 --> 32:43.127
It's okay. All right? So let's…

32:43.878 --> 32:47.382
let's try a… a different approach.

32:47.465 --> 32:48.299
All right?

32:49.008 --> 32:50.927
Let's just forget about it, huh?

32:51.552 --> 32:54.681
And let's start our new chapter.

33:00.144 --> 33:03.856
How am I supposed to do that
when my heart is still broken?

33:05.191 --> 33:06.901
See, I've tried to move on,

33:06.985 --> 33:11.197
but I can't stop feeling
like I was just worthless.

33:12.949 --> 33:17.245
I mean, why else push me aside
for whiskey and some random woman?

33:18.454 --> 33:21.874
You know, when Annie asked me
why you were gone,

33:21.958 --> 33:25.920
I could only tell her about the drinking
because I couldn't make myself say

33:26.004 --> 33:31.926
that you had been unfaithful
because it… it killed me to even think it.

33:32.969 --> 33:37.015
You gave that woman something so precious.

33:37.724 --> 33:41.310
So how can you say
that she didn't mean anything?

33:42.770 --> 33:46.816
And how much can your vows
really mean when you trashed 'em?

33:48.234 --> 33:50.653
I can recite
all the lyrics to "I Love Rock 'n Roll,"

33:50.737 --> 33:53.114
but that don't mean
I'm going on tour, does it?!

33:53.740 --> 33:54.741
Why?!

33:54.824 --> 33:58.369
Why didn't you just tell me
that you were unhappy?

34:01.039 --> 34:04.917
You know that couple that said
all those sweet things to each other?

34:06.252 --> 34:07.754
You destroyed them!

34:08.963 --> 34:11.132
You did! And they are gone!

34:12.759 --> 34:14.385
Just like you need to be.

34:36.657 --> 34:38.910
I was more afraid of Miss Frances
than I was of my daddy,

34:38.993 --> 34:41.454
so I had my life flash before my eyes

34:41.537 --> 34:43.790
three or four times
during that long walk to his office.

34:43.873 --> 34:46.459
And I think she might have liked
to see me sweat a bit.

34:46.542 --> 34:47.585
Oh yes.

34:47.668 --> 34:50.755
But it was all so that she could surprise
me and my dad together with the news

34:50.838 --> 34:53.049
that I'd gotten
the Chamber of Commerce Scholarship.

34:55.426 --> 34:56.677
She will be missed.

34:58.888 --> 35:02.100
-Thank you, Trent. That was lovely.
-My pleasure. If there's nothing else--

35:02.183 --> 35:04.936
-Oh, there is one more thing.
-Ah, shoot.

35:06.604 --> 35:08.022
You need to understand,

35:08.731 --> 35:11.067
I'm not going to keep
your secrets anymore.

35:24.914 --> 35:25.915
-Hey.
-Hey.

35:26.499 --> 35:27.500
How was PT?

35:28.042 --> 35:31.796
Uh, it was brutal, as usual.
But anything to get back on the field.

35:34.882 --> 35:35.716
What's up?

35:40.555 --> 35:43.182
I got
the Division I recruiting schedules.

35:45.768 --> 35:48.312
They don't line up
with your timetable for full recovery.

35:49.897 --> 35:53.693
The schools that you were hoping to attend
may not be an option anymore.

35:57.905 --> 35:59.532
So all those hours in rehab?

36:01.159 --> 36:05.121
All those years
practicing, competing, and training.

36:05.204 --> 36:08.040
-It's all… it's all been for nothing?
-No. Never nothing.

36:08.124 --> 36:10.334
But the bridge you're talking about,
Coach, this is it!

36:10.418 --> 36:12.962
-Ty, there are other ways forward.
-I've already reached out.

36:13.045 --> 36:14.046
There are great programs--

36:14.130 --> 36:16.716
I… I don't wanna talk about
Team Almost-Good-Enough!

36:17.425 --> 36:20.761
There was never a time
where DI baseball wasn't my goal!

36:23.723 --> 36:27.268
Y'all are gonna have to give me a second
to get over the fact that I lost my dream

36:27.351 --> 36:29.687
in one stupid night!

36:41.282 --> 36:43.326
You know, it's great
to see you in a workshop again.

36:43.409 --> 36:45.203
Kinda like back
when you made my dollhouse.

36:45.286 --> 36:49.582
Ah! Yeah, that was a beaut.
Surprised you gave that to Katie.

36:49.665 --> 36:52.251
She basically moved in to my room
so she could play with it.

36:52.335 --> 36:55.254
It was either that or make space
for her clothes in my closet.

36:55.922 --> 36:58.382
-I can make you another one.
-Appreciate that.

37:00.218 --> 37:03.471
So my friend Lily,
uh, her family just came to town.

37:03.554 --> 37:04.680
They go to Prince of Peace,

37:04.764 --> 37:07.433
and Lily and I led a group together
for Vacation Bible School.

37:07.516 --> 37:11.145
Yeah, you've mentioned her before.
I'm glad you have a new friend.

37:11.229 --> 37:12.396
She's awesome.

37:13.231 --> 37:16.651
She even invited me to go
to the family's lake house this weekend.

37:16.734 --> 37:17.860
Is it okay if I go?

37:18.903 --> 37:21.405
Well, what did your mother say?

37:23.699 --> 37:24.533
No.

37:25.660 --> 37:27.203
Why are you asking me?

37:27.912 --> 37:29.830
Because I thought you'd say yes.

37:31.999 --> 37:32.833
Don't do that.

37:33.417 --> 37:36.462
Come on, the one thing
your mother and I have never wavered in

37:36.545 --> 37:37.630
is raising you right.

37:40.132 --> 37:41.050
Respect that?

37:42.927 --> 37:43.844
Thank you.

37:48.432 --> 37:51.435
Our game won't have a stupid cliffhanger
like <i>Realms of Tyranny</i>.

37:51.519 --> 37:54.480
Or that stupid
"<i>you</i> were the villain!" revelation

37:54.563 --> 37:56.607
at the end of <i>The Spider's Broken Web.</i>

37:58.109 --> 38:01.153
You know, Nellie might have
some thoughts about that final twist.

38:03.447 --> 38:06.951
You know, we talk nonstop about the game,
and I'm all about that,

38:07.034 --> 38:10.496
but let's pause
and toggle your character tab a bit.

38:10.579 --> 38:15.793
You're super fun and talented
and just really great people.

38:15.876 --> 38:17.336
Thanks?

38:17.420 --> 38:20.840
But for someone who's so smart,
you're a complete idiot about Nellie.

38:21.674 --> 38:22.591
What?

38:23.175 --> 38:24.927
I was hoping
you would realize it on your own,

38:25.011 --> 38:26.721
but clearly,
I have to give you a hint box.

38:27.596 --> 38:30.099
I'm… I'm not even close
to following what you're talking about.

38:30.182 --> 38:31.392
Kyle.

38:32.101 --> 38:35.229
You brought Nellie into our crew,
you always stick up for her,

38:35.313 --> 38:38.065
and you keep bringing her up
when she's not related to the topic.

38:38.149 --> 38:39.025
You're into her.

38:39.108 --> 38:42.611
-No, no. I don't think of her like that.
-Well, you should.

38:44.030 --> 38:45.406
I read these things well.

38:46.657 --> 38:48.868
And you'd make a great fit.

38:52.204 --> 38:54.165
Accept the true quest.

38:55.416 --> 38:56.334
Go for Nellie.

39:00.171 --> 39:02.340
Nana and Mom found
a whole bunch of pictures

39:02.423 --> 39:04.175
of "The Little Magnolias"
with Miss Frances.

39:04.258 --> 39:05.134
Yeah.

39:05.217 --> 39:07.720
In case you wanna put 'em
in a slideshow at church.

39:07.803 --> 39:09.722
Oh, I'm so glad that they found these.

39:09.805 --> 39:13.392
I think that all of mine from that era
are with my mama down in Florida.

39:18.564 --> 39:20.066
Anything else on your mind?

39:21.275 --> 39:23.235
Is, uh, CeCe working today?

39:23.319 --> 39:27.656
No, uh, she and her mother drove up
to North Carolina to look at colleges.

39:30.659 --> 39:33.371
-She's going to college?
-She's exploring her options.

39:33.454 --> 39:37.666
It's a new idea for her and her parents,
but she's really excited.

39:39.043 --> 39:42.380
-She didn't tell you.
-We're not exactly talking anymore.

39:44.215 --> 39:45.257
We broke up.

39:45.341 --> 39:46.509
Oh, Ty.

39:47.009 --> 39:49.553
-I'm so sorry.
-She didn't tell you?

39:49.637 --> 39:51.555
I don't ask about her personal life.

39:53.015 --> 39:55.893
And I won't ask about yours.

39:58.104 --> 39:59.605
Unless you want me to.

40:02.775 --> 40:04.693
Mmm, I'm not sure what went wrong.

40:05.653 --> 40:08.072
I mean, I… I know why she got angry,

40:08.155 --> 40:11.784
but when I wanted to talk it through,
she didn't want to, so…

40:11.867 --> 40:12.868
Love is hard.

40:12.952 --> 40:16.163
And first love is the worst.

40:16.247 --> 40:18.582
Well, I… I'm not sure I'm…

40:19.583 --> 40:20.835
was in love with her.

40:20.918 --> 40:24.046
You let her into your heart
to whatever degree.

40:24.130 --> 40:25.464
That leaves a mark.

40:26.465 --> 40:27.341
Forever.

40:28.801 --> 40:30.302
And… and…

40:30.970 --> 40:33.139
I'm not judging or… or lecturing.

40:33.222 --> 40:34.974
I'm just… I'm just sharing.

40:36.559 --> 40:39.019
But the people we love first,

40:39.103 --> 40:42.815
maybe even before we fully know
what it means to be loved,

40:42.898 --> 40:45.151
they're with us from that day forward.

40:45.234 --> 40:47.319
And even if you try not to, you… you…

40:48.028 --> 40:52.366
You measure every person
who comes after them against them.

40:52.950 --> 40:55.369
Better or… or worse,

40:56.412 --> 40:57.705
not as funny,

40:58.747 --> 41:00.666
weirder taste in music…

41:00.749 --> 41:02.501
-Simpler coffee orders.
-Eh.

41:06.380 --> 41:08.591
So, here's what I try to do about that.

41:11.177 --> 41:14.346
I try to be grateful
for what that person taught me

41:14.430 --> 41:18.225
about the world and about myself.

41:19.602 --> 41:24.398
But not let remembering the first
keep me from seeing the next

41:24.482 --> 41:27.401
as the… completely unique

41:27.485 --> 41:30.779
and… utterly marvelous…

41:33.365 --> 41:36.410
even if slightly guarded person
that they may be.

41:37.369 --> 41:38.662
-Aunt Helen?
-Hmm?

41:40.247 --> 41:42.583
Do you think
you can ever go back to the first?

41:52.718 --> 41:53.636
Maybe.

41:56.680 --> 41:57.765
Maybe.

42:01.393 --> 42:02.853
As long as you're not going there

42:02.937 --> 42:05.481
because you're running
from something else.

42:07.191 --> 42:08.025
Hey.

42:09.944 --> 42:12.363
You know your worth first,

42:12.988 --> 42:14.073
and then

42:15.324 --> 42:17.076
you find someone who complements it,

42:17.701 --> 42:20.246
even if you have to look for a long time.

42:24.041 --> 42:26.669
-Hope you're not too old for auntie hugs.
-Never.

42:26.752 --> 42:28.504
-Because I'm coming in hot.
-I'm ready for it.

42:31.257 --> 42:32.091
Thank you.

42:32.967 --> 42:33.926
Thank you.

42:38.597 --> 42:40.933
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
-Why?

42:41.517 --> 42:44.645
There's no healing without honesty,

42:45.896 --> 42:48.524
and you were just being honest
about how you feel.

42:48.607 --> 42:50.734
When I was pointing at him to leave,

42:51.235 --> 42:53.445
all I could think of was my mama saying,

42:53.529 --> 42:56.282
"You point at someone,
three fingers point back at you."

42:56.782 --> 42:58.617
And then it just… it hit me.

42:58.701 --> 43:01.453
Forgiving Ronnie for his mistakes

43:01.537 --> 43:05.791
means forgiving myself
for the damage that I caused.

43:05.874 --> 43:11.088
And accepting that
you are worthy of forgiveness.

43:11.171 --> 43:12.548
-Am I?
-Yeah.

43:13.132 --> 43:14.925
That's the beauty of grace.

43:16.427 --> 43:21.807
We're forgiven even as we struggle
with the enormity of the gift.

43:22.474 --> 43:23.934
But I broke my vows.

43:24.893 --> 43:29.857
I stood before God and our family
and our friends, and I said,

43:29.940 --> 43:31.734
"I will support your dreams

43:31.817 --> 43:36.030
as passionately as I believe
in your ability to achieve them."

43:36.113 --> 43:38.657
And did you do that
to the best of your ability?

43:38.741 --> 43:40.159
I did not.

43:40.242 --> 43:41.160
Why not?

43:41.702 --> 43:44.121
I doubted and then blamed.

43:44.955 --> 43:48.751
And… …all the mess-ups
and… …the resentments,

43:48.834 --> 43:50.836
they just piled so high

43:50.919 --> 43:53.964
that I couldn't even see him
behind all his flaws,

43:54.048 --> 43:55.924
and I completely ignored my own.

43:56.008 --> 43:58.594
Recognizing where you both went wrong

43:58.677 --> 44:01.513
is a crucial step
in getting you back on the right track.

44:01.597 --> 44:04.475
I mean, God knows, I still love him,

44:04.558 --> 44:07.728
and I… I want to trust him again,

44:07.811 --> 44:11.690
but I feel like
if I let go of all of this hurt

44:11.774 --> 44:15.277
and all of this anger…
…like, I'll fall apart.

44:15.861 --> 44:18.280
Dana Sue, dear heart,

44:19.198 --> 44:24.119
until you've fallen apart,
we can't put you back together.

44:25.371 --> 44:26.955
Oh, I'm here.

44:27.623 --> 44:28.457
It's okay.

44:28.957 --> 44:30.334
-I'm here.

44:30.834 --> 44:31.710
I'm here.

44:49.186 --> 44:52.439
I assume you're here
to deliver good news about the petition?

44:52.523 --> 44:53.357
I am.

44:55.192 --> 44:58.237
The clerk completed
the signature verification process

44:58.320 --> 45:00.155
and ratified the petition.

45:01.740 --> 45:04.451
The recall process has officially begun.

45:05.828 --> 45:07.121
Well,

45:08.288 --> 45:11.750
then I am compelled
to call an emergency school board meeting…

45:13.877 --> 45:15.129
to discuss allegations

45:15.212 --> 45:18.924
that may require the termination
of Cal's contract with the high school.

45:20.050 --> 45:21.885
What are these allegations?

45:21.969 --> 45:25.222
It would be inappropriate of me
to speak outside of executive session.

45:25.305 --> 45:27.516
You know how gossip travels in Serenity.

45:28.100 --> 45:32.312
Besides, if you're sleeping with a man,
shouldn't you <i>know</i> his secrets?

45:32.396 --> 45:34.314
Or don't you learn from your mistakes?

45:35.691 --> 45:38.402
This is what I'm willing to do
for the man that I love.

45:39.278 --> 45:40.154
How about you?

45:44.867 --> 45:46.577
I'm sorry I'm late.

45:46.660 --> 45:50.372
I'm still learning
to anticipate Castlewood traffic.

45:50.456 --> 45:52.166
-Mind if we walk?
-Not at all.

45:52.750 --> 45:56.628
I sure hope you haven't heard
all the good Miss Frances stories already.

45:56.712 --> 45:58.297
That's not why I called you.

45:58.797 --> 45:59.631
Oh.

46:00.132 --> 46:03.177
Well, look, I don't think it's appropriate
for me to comment on a recall.

46:03.260 --> 46:05.763
-Between me moving--
-You and I have a child.

46:07.973 --> 46:08.974
What did you say?

46:09.057 --> 46:10.184
You heard me.

46:14.271 --> 46:15.898
Oh, don't you walk away from me!

46:20.569 --> 46:21.403
Wha…

46:21.904 --> 46:24.406
Wha… what the hell, Peggy?

46:25.115 --> 46:27.451
Here? In Town Square?

46:27.534 --> 46:30.078
I'm sorry, would you rather
a bar at Sullivan's

46:30.162 --> 46:31.455
or a booth at Wharton's, perhaps?

46:31.538 --> 46:33.290
You know, if anyone asks,

46:33.373 --> 46:36.001
you are more than welcome to tell them
I wanted to hear a cute story

46:36.084 --> 46:39.129
about Miss Frances
that I am not going to listen to.

46:41.381 --> 46:43.884
The Model UN Conference in Raleigh?

46:44.760 --> 46:46.678
Beginning of junior year?

46:51.099 --> 46:52.768
Why didn't you tell me?

46:52.851 --> 46:55.521
Our mothers decided it was for the best.

46:56.271 --> 46:57.397
My mama?!

46:58.273 --> 47:00.150
Why didn't <i>she</i> tell me?

47:00.234 --> 47:02.986
That is a conversation
for you to have with yours.

47:03.737 --> 47:06.990
Mine told me they decided
enough lives have been ruined

47:07.074 --> 47:09.284
and that it was best you didn't know.

47:11.537 --> 47:15.040
Maybe yours should have told you
so you could learn from your mistakes.

47:15.123 --> 47:19.545
Oh, and that's why you're telling me now?
'Cause my life isn't fully upside down?

47:19.628 --> 47:21.171
Mmm.

47:22.339 --> 47:23.507
Peggy, wait!

47:23.590 --> 47:24.633
Peggy, please!

47:26.468 --> 47:28.554
I just wish you would have told me.

47:29.930 --> 47:32.850
I cannot express how sorry I am

47:32.933 --> 47:36.937
that it took me two decades
to learn how to say no to my mother.

47:39.022 --> 47:43.569
This will not change anything between us.
I don't want or need anything from you.

47:43.652 --> 47:47.072
The only thing I want from you
is something you can't give.

47:48.866 --> 47:51.493
Twenty-two years, Peggy.

47:51.577 --> 47:53.495
Imagine how I felt,

47:53.579 --> 47:56.081
knowing that he was out there somewhere,

47:56.164 --> 47:58.917
praying that he was loved and cherished.

47:59.001 --> 47:59.835
Was he?

48:03.714 --> 48:04.965
Ask him yourself.

48:23.734 --> 48:24.902
Dr. Townsend.

48:24.985 --> 48:25.944
Isaac.

48:30.866 --> 48:31.950
Thank you.

48:35.287 --> 48:37.456
Now I'm gonna ask you to leave.

48:44.963 --> 48:45.797
Never again.
