00:47.460 --> 00:48.750
Look who's alive.

00:51.090 --> 00:52.470
Why didn't you get me out?

00:53.380 --> 00:54.510
I tried.

00:56.590 --> 00:58.680
You're gonna make it.

01:02.430 --> 01:05.230
-Mudder's gonna take the kids.
-Your Mother?

01:05.270 --> 01:08.650
And, she'll take 'em
tonight to, if you wants.

01:08.690 --> 01:12.400
Maybe we can go up to
Signal Hill and make out.

01:12.440 --> 01:14.650
If you're good, maybe.

01:14.700 --> 01:15.030
Here you go.

01:16.160 --> 01:18.660
I'll go get Malachy
dressed. Now you-

01:18.700 --> 01:22.250
You be good to your mudder. I
don't want her crooked tonight.

01:22.290 --> 01:24.710
Come on Let's go.

01:32.380 --> 01:35.220
Come on. What are you
gonna wear today?

Jake Doyle. In here with
us degenerates.

My, my. How the mighty have
fallen. Must be killing you.

02:59.380 --> 02:59.680
Leslie on death's door.

I'm home.

03:19.240 --> 03:20.650
Des: I've been meaning
to talk to you.

03:20.700 --> 03:22.360
We don't have enough
money for cable.

03:22.410 --> 03:23.950
Actually, we don't have enough
money for anything.

03:23.990 --> 03:25.160
Is this important?

03:25.200 --> 03:25.540
You're on the clock.

03:26.950 --> 03:28.410
That would imply that I'm
being paid. Which I'm not.

03:28.450 --> 03:28.750
You say something?

03:29.710 --> 03:29.910
Poppy.
I need to talk to you.

03:31.330 --> 03:32.420
No, Just rehearsaing for a
play. About being paid.

03:32.460 --> 03:32.790
Rose:
Mal? Is that you?

03:33.750 --> 03:34.040
-More bills.
-Don't you start.

03:35.500 --> 03:37.340
You got a game plan on how
we're gonna pay all these?

03:37.380 --> 03:38.880
Rent Des out as
a male stripper.

03:38.920 --> 03:40.590
We need to make money.
Not lose it.

03:40.630 --> 03:42.470
And we still don't have
enough to meet Jake's bail.

03:42.510 --> 03:42.840
I'm aware.

03:43.970 --> 03:44.260
Plus, Jake Doyle,
suspected murderer,

03:45.390 --> 03:46.510
isn't exactly good
for P.I. business.

03:46.560 --> 03:46.890
She's totally right.

03:47.770 --> 03:48.020
Rose: Mal.
Tinny: Poppy!

03:48.980 --> 03:49.850
No she's not.
No you're not.

03:49.890 --> 03:51.230
Everyone be quiet!

03:51.270 --> 03:52.690
We have to stay
positive and figure

03:52.730 --> 03:53.980
out a way to get
Jake out of jail.

03:55.230 --> 03:57.900
You're right. We'll find
a way. We always do.

03:57.940 --> 03:59.110
We wouldn't be in
this mess if Sloan

03:59.150 --> 04:00.740
didn't steal everything we had.

04:00.780 --> 04:04.410
Yeah. Speaking of which,
I have to talk to Jake.

04:05.740 --> 04:08.160
I'm gonna see Leslie.
Our sister needs a break.

04:09.580 --> 04:13.500
If you ever see Sloan,
you thank her for all this.

04:25.720 --> 04:26.930
Eyeballing Brogan?

04:29.600 --> 04:30.140
Risky.

04:30.980 --> 04:32.100
Do you mind if I sit down?

04:32.140 --> 04:33.560
Jake:
Sure. Go ahead.

04:34.810 --> 04:35.810
Thanks.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.070
In here, they call you
the mayor slayer.

04:42.110 --> 04:45.070
Yeah. Well, I haven't
killed anyone, yet.

04:45.110 --> 04:46.410
You're innocent. Sure.

04:46.450 --> 04:48.530
Aren't we all?
Deep down? I mean-

04:48.580 --> 04:50.790
Outside of the crimes
we committed?

04:50.830 --> 04:53.080
I heard you were released
from segregation.

04:53.120 --> 04:54.870
Tough stuff.

04:54.920 --> 04:56.750
Go away. Now.

04:59.250 --> 05:01.090
You're a private eye,
aren't you?

05:01.130 --> 05:04.090
Yeah. I mean. I was. I am.
I mean, whatever.

05:04.130 --> 05:04.340
Do I know you?

05:05.300 --> 05:06.760
I'm Seth Rankin.
Of the Rankins.

05:06.800 --> 05:08.470
Not the band. If
you can help me.

05:08.510 --> 05:09.640
Maybe I can help you.

05:09.680 --> 05:09.890
Walk away. Okay, pally.

05:11.520 --> 05:14.020
It's none of my business. But I
heard you were in need of bail.

05:14.060 --> 05:16.400
And I thought maybe
I can help.

05:16.440 --> 05:16.600
You just happen to
have a hundred

05:17.940 --> 05:19.860
thousand dollars
lying around here? For my bail?

05:19.900 --> 05:22.900
Listen, if you can help me.

05:22.940 --> 05:24.950
I just might.

05:24.990 --> 05:26.740
That's all I'm saying.

05:26.780 --> 05:28.910
Rankin. Doyle. Visitors.

05:28.950 --> 05:30.990
Who?

05:37.960 --> 05:39.710
Do you understand what
Walter is saying?

05:39.750 --> 05:40.090
Yeah.

05:40.920 --> 05:41.210
-And?
-You're positive.

05:42.840 --> 05:44.630
If you want the bank to insure
the money that Sloan, stole -

05:44.670 --> 05:44.970
Charges have to be laid.

05:46.340 --> 05:48.010
You want me to press charges
on my own daughter.

05:48.050 --> 05:49.550
The daughter that
cleaned out the

05:49.590 --> 05:51.930
entirety of your
family's life savings?

05:51.970 --> 05:53.020
Yeah.

05:53.060 --> 05:53.350
Let's not mention the fact-

05:54.850 --> 05:56.770
that there is no bail money
for you anywhere in sight.

05:56.810 --> 06:00.560
If anyone presses charges on
Sloan, I swear to God-

06:00.610 --> 06:02.820
I'll murder the both of ye.

06:02.860 --> 06:03.150
Why not?

06:04.650 --> 06:06.280
Add another murder charge to
your impressive rap sheet.

06:06.320 --> 06:06.610
But you're right.

06:07.860 --> 06:08.950
If the money is gone,
and we pursue Sloan,

06:08.990 --> 06:09.320
it will ruin her life.

06:10.320 --> 06:11.620
I hate to say this,
but I fear

06:11.660 --> 06:13.120
that ship may have-
already sailed.

06:13.160 --> 06:15.120
Have you found her?
Any sign of her yet?

06:15.160 --> 06:15.370
No. Not yet.

06:16.660 --> 06:18.500
I wish I knew more. I'm
worried about Sloan too.

06:18.540 --> 06:20.040
Walter: Anyways, I
got a court day.

06:20.080 --> 06:21.630
Stay out of the showers.

06:24.050 --> 06:24.300
We just have to start over.

06:25.760 --> 06:28.090
Says the fella who's incapable
of earning us any money.

06:31.760 --> 06:33.390
What's our next move?

06:35.640 --> 06:37.690
Hey, Papillon. What now?

06:39.310 --> 06:41.520
Right. I need you to
look into someone for me.

06:41.560 --> 06:43.480
Actually, he's
right behind ya.

06:43.520 --> 06:45.480
Great. You're taking cases out
on the inside, now.

06:45.530 --> 06:46.940
Did he pay you in smokes?

06:46.990 --> 06:47.320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:48.490 --> 06:50.490
Listen, you got any
updates on Leslie?

06:50.530 --> 06:53.160
That's the millionth time
you've asked me, son.

06:53.200 --> 06:53.490
Just focus on getting
out of here.

06:55.080 --> 06:57.410
If anything changes, I swear
I'll let you know right away.

06:57.450 --> 06:59.420
What am I supposed to
do in the meantime?

06:59.460 --> 06:59.790
Stay out of trouble.

07:01.380 --> 07:03.210
Which I know is like asking
you to take a vow of silence.

07:03.250 --> 07:05.550
But just- try.

07:13.760 --> 07:15.970
Don't worry. She's gonna
make it. Leslie's too strong

07:16.010 --> 07:17.430
to let something like
this take her down.

07:17.470 --> 07:19.100
She's been like this
for three weeks.

07:19.140 --> 07:20.890
Doctor says if she doesn't
come out of it soon-

07:20.940 --> 07:22.900
She may not come
out of it at all.

07:22.940 --> 07:26.320
I can't help but wonder what's
happening in there.

07:28.190 --> 07:28.530
If she hears us.

07:29.990 --> 07:31.950
If there's something we can
do to snap her out of it.

07:31.990 --> 07:32.320
I wonder-

07:33.820 --> 07:37.080
if there's something we could
do to snap her out of it.

07:37.120 --> 07:40.580
Des. We're not making out in
front of a coma stricken Leslie.

07:40.620 --> 07:41.870
Of course not.
I can't even believe

07:41.920 --> 07:43.040
you'd suggest such a thing.

07:44.170 --> 07:45.540
At least Brogan's in prison.

07:45.590 --> 07:46.590
For now.

07:46.630 --> 07:46.920
But Leslie is the only one

07:48.550 --> 07:50.590
who can tell us that Brogan is
the one that did this to her.

07:50.630 --> 07:52.880
I gotta go.
I gotta meet Malachy.

07:52.930 --> 07:54.930
If you need anything,
call me. I love you.

07:56.310 --> 07:57.520
Thanks.

08:05.900 --> 08:08.480
Seth: My uncle got the
business after my Dad died.

08:08.530 --> 08:10.490
And he was running it
into the ground.

08:10.530 --> 08:13.280
So -
I robbed the joint.

08:13.320 --> 08:13.570
Robbing from your own family.

08:14.990 --> 08:16.580
You haven't met my daughter,
by any chance, have you?

08:16.620 --> 08:16.830
No.

08:18.240 --> 08:20.950
But if you can help me,
I can get your bail money.

08:21.000 --> 08:25.080
I have stashed two mill
worth of uncut diamonds.

08:25.130 --> 08:27.880
I put them in a
security deposit box

08:27.920 --> 08:29.750
under my girlfriend
Molly's name.

08:29.800 --> 08:32.170
I had to hide the key in my
bum to get it in here.

08:33.510 --> 08:35.760
Okay. We just met, and
already you're telling me

08:35.800 --> 08:38.680
about two million dollars
worth of uncut diamonds? Why?

08:38.720 --> 08:40.390
Because I had to make
sure my girlfriend,

08:40.430 --> 08:42.480
Molly's safe until I get out.

08:42.520 --> 08:45.060
She's got the other key. It
takes two to open a box.

08:45.100 --> 08:47.650
So you're afraid people are
gonna go after her for the key.

08:47.690 --> 08:50.980
Look, I tell you what. I'll get
my father to keep an eye on her.

08:51.030 --> 08:53.490
Alright. Meet the culprits.

08:53.530 --> 08:55.320
That's Marko.

08:55.360 --> 08:56.490
Marko Long.

08:56.530 --> 08:56.870
Yeah, I know him.

08:58.370 --> 08:59.870
Seth: I'm a hundred and ten
percent sure he's the guy.

08:59.910 --> 09:01.540
Would you stop
pointing at the man.

09:01.580 --> 09:03.160
What makes you so sure
Marko's got your key?

09:04.080 --> 09:06.000
We used to share a cell. And-

09:06.040 --> 09:08.170
I might have told him about
the diamonds.

09:10.090 --> 09:13.050
It's amazing to me that you
managed to stay alive this long.

09:13.090 --> 09:13.300
I know.

09:14.590 --> 09:16.890
Also, you know, it could
be one of these fellas.

09:16.930 --> 09:17.180
Jake:
Is that Taylor Gossard?

09:18.600 --> 09:20.180
Yeah. He runs round with
The Chevalier Biker in here.

09:20.220 --> 09:20.430
But he's all right.

09:21.600 --> 09:22.350
Taylor Gossard is far
from all right.

09:22.390 --> 09:23.730
In fact, he's a-

09:23.770 --> 09:25.310
Crack dealing, murdering-

09:25.350 --> 09:25.650
Bell head.

09:27.020 --> 09:27.360
Seth: I'm pretty sure
Marko's got the key on him

09:28.440 --> 09:29.110
right now. We
need to search him.

09:29.900 --> 09:31.280
How are we gonna do that?

09:36.990 --> 09:37.870
No!

09:42.660 --> 09:43.660
Jake did it.

09:45.210 --> 09:45.500
Jake Doyle.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.500
You really do know everyone
here, don't you Jake?

09:48.540 --> 09:48.830
Jake's the reason

09:50.420 --> 09:52.000
why I've taken up residence in
Her Majesty's Penitentiary.

09:52.050 --> 09:52.340
Isn't that right, Jake?

09:53.460 --> 09:54.510
Well, that's kinda
my father's fault.

09:54.550 --> 09:56.010
You should really blame him.

09:56.050 --> 09:58.550
Don't be so modest.
You got me busted.

09:58.590 --> 09:58.840
Marko, don't take it
so personally.

10:00.430 --> 10:02.600
I'm the reason why have the
losers in this place got busted.

10:02.640 --> 10:04.520
Did you hear that fellas?

10:05.020 --> 10:05.940
Losers!

10:16.070 --> 10:21.080
[Alarm]

10:21.740 --> 10:23.450
Come with me. Now.

10:34.250 --> 10:35.880
All clear, Ma'am.

10:44.560 --> 10:47.270
-You won't tell, will ya?
-Those things will kill ya.

10:47.310 --> 10:50.230
So will starting a
riot in my yard.

10:50.270 --> 10:52.480
I knew your father,
Malachy. He was a good cop.

10:53.320 --> 10:54.480
So people keep telling me.

10:54.530 --> 10:54.780
He was.

10:56.360 --> 10:58.110
You can only imagine what a
disappointment I must be to him.

10:58.150 --> 10:58.450
I wouldn't say that.

10:59.990 --> 11:02.370
To be honest, when I found out
that you were coming here.

11:02.410 --> 11:04.620
I thought this could be
so good for me.

11:04.660 --> 11:07.620
It's pretty terrible for me,
but, go ahead.

11:07.660 --> 11:09.040
This institution's a hole.

11:09.080 --> 11:11.210
It's no place for
a person to live.

11:11.250 --> 11:12.920
It's rotten from
the inside out.

11:12.960 --> 11:15.800
It's compounded by the crap
that keeps coming in.

11:15.840 --> 11:18.380
I need someone to help me-
clean it up.

11:19.720 --> 11:21.300
You want me to be a rat.

11:21.340 --> 11:22.930
I want to know where the drugs
are coming from.

11:22.970 --> 11:24.800
Who's supplying and
distributing.

11:24.850 --> 11:26.470
With all due respect,
if I help you-

11:26.510 --> 11:28.180
My life will be even
more miserable

11:28.230 --> 11:29.600
in here than it already is.

11:29.640 --> 11:31.810
I can make your life hell too.

11:31.850 --> 11:33.310
Why don't you think
about that?

11:33.360 --> 11:35.360
Decide which team you're on.

11:42.070 --> 11:42.950
Guard:
All clear.

11:49.370 --> 11:52.500
[Beep, beep, beep]

12:00.090 --> 12:01.510
Jake?

12:29.370 --> 12:30.450
[Monitor beeps an alarm]

12:30.500 --> 12:31.370
Leslie?

12:34.120 --> 12:37.960
We need a doctor. We
need a doctor now!

12:46.220 --> 12:46.510
Rose: The doctor said that
Leslie had a seizure.

12:48.100 --> 12:50.220
Which could be a good thing,
means she's coming out of it.

12:50.270 --> 12:51.680
-But-
-What?

12:51.720 --> 12:53.310
He also said that if
she had too many,

12:53.350 --> 12:53.980
she may suffer brain damage.
Or worse.

12:55.560 --> 12:57.520
Don't tell Jake about this.
He won't be able to handle it.

12:57.560 --> 12:58.440
Agreed.

13:02.320 --> 13:06.200
All this with Leslie,
Sloan, no money.

13:06.240 --> 13:08.950
Kathleen's in Europe somewhere.

13:08.990 --> 13:10.830
Haven't heard from
Christian in over a year.

13:10.870 --> 13:13.040
Don't know if he's sober
or alive, or what.

13:13.080 --> 13:14.460
I know.

13:14.500 --> 13:15.830
We just - Mal,
we have to believe

13:15.870 --> 13:17.290
that everything's
gonna be okay.

13:17.330 --> 13:19.170
[Phone rings]

13:20.300 --> 13:20.630
Hey there, Killer.

13:21.760 --> 13:23.420
You're hilarious.
Is this a bad time?

13:23.460 --> 13:23.760
I'd answer that honestly,
but I'm-

13:25.090 --> 13:27.090
trying to be nicer to you
now that you're in jail.

13:27.140 --> 13:28.180
Again.

13:28.220 --> 13:28.430
You realize I'm surrounded by a

13:29.560 --> 13:30.930
bunch of people that
we put in here.

13:30.970 --> 13:31.270
Must be nice to see
old friends.

13:32.390 --> 13:34.060
Yeah. Taylor Gossard
is no friend.

13:34.100 --> 13:34.440
Trust me.

13:35.730 --> 13:37.440
Any updates on what I asked
you to look into?

13:37.480 --> 13:40.650
Seth Rankin? Yeah. His story
seems to cheek out.

13:40.690 --> 13:42.480
He robbed his uncle's
jewelry store.

13:42.530 --> 13:44.440
Then the police tracked him
down at his girlfriend's-

13:44.490 --> 13:46.110
Molly Higgins. We
don't have much on her.

13:46.150 --> 13:47.700
Good. She could be in danger.

13:47.740 --> 13:48.070
Mal: We know.

13:49.240 --> 13:50.030
Des is there now,
keeping an eye on her.

13:50.080 --> 13:51.370
And Leslie?

13:51.410 --> 13:53.200
She's -

13:53.240 --> 13:55.040
She's fine.
The doctors are really hopeful

13:55.080 --> 13:56.410
that she's gonna
get out of this.

13:56.460 --> 13:58.290
And she's making progress.

13:58.830 --> 13:59.080
Thank God.

14:00.250 --> 14:01.960
It's nice to hear a bit
of good news.

14:02.000 --> 14:02.300
I guess it would be
stupid of me

14:03.630 --> 14:05.420
to think that Dad actually
tracked down Sloan.

14:05.470 --> 14:05.760
And that she's doing okay.

14:07.180 --> 14:09.430
Not yet. But if I find
anything I'll let you know.

14:09.470 --> 14:11.560
Alright. Talk to you later.

14:12.970 --> 14:13.850
Yeah.

14:17.060 --> 14:19.730
He doesn't need any more
heartbreak right now.

14:22.270 --> 14:24.690
Jake: Here you go ma'am.
It's not Keith's Take Out.

14:24.730 --> 14:26.700
But it will have to do.

14:26.740 --> 14:28.700
Now this was a good idea.

14:28.740 --> 14:30.530
I was thinking.

14:30.570 --> 14:31.870
Maybe we should have
another baby.

14:31.910 --> 14:32.240
Right now? Here?

14:33.740 --> 14:37.290
Yeah. I don't think people
would mind seeing us naked.

14:37.330 --> 14:38.620
Doing it on the car.

14:38.670 --> 14:40.540
Possibly.

14:40.580 --> 14:40.880
If you don't do it.

14:42.130 --> 14:43.920
I'll sell your birth
control on the street.

14:43.960 --> 14:46.300
Can we talk about
something else?

14:46.340 --> 14:48.970
other than keeping me pregnant
for two minutes? Please.

14:49.010 --> 14:50.680
Alright.

14:50.720 --> 14:53.470
You got two minutes.
Starting -

14:53.510 --> 14:55.680
Now.

14:55.720 --> 14:57.730
I'm up for Staff Sergeant
next year.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.860
Well, congratulations,
Staff Sergeant.

15:02.900 --> 15:04.190
Don't make fun.

15:04.230 --> 15:06.230
I'm not making fun.

15:06.280 --> 15:08.900
I like the idea of you being
more authoritative.

15:08.940 --> 15:12.410
Although, it does put a damper
on the whole new baby thing.

15:12.450 --> 15:14.620
Two minutes, I said.

15:14.660 --> 15:17.120
I'm only joking, b'y.
I'm joking'.

15:17.160 --> 15:18.870
Too bad I'm going away
for murder.

15:19.620 --> 15:21.080
What did you just say?

15:21.120 --> 15:22.460
I didn't kill anyone, Leslie.

15:23.630 --> 15:25.050
I need your help.

15:39.480 --> 15:41.770
Hey Jake. Taylor-

15:41.810 --> 15:44.820
wanted to see ya.
Hope that's cool.

15:45.320 --> 15:46.230
Jakey.

15:46.270 --> 15:48.150
Welcome to my world.

15:48.190 --> 15:50.190
Good to see a familiar face.

15:50.240 --> 15:53.070
Oh yeah, Taylor. I really
missed ya on the outside.

15:53.110 --> 15:56.410
You're kinda famous around
these parts.

15:56.450 --> 15:58.240
And not in a good way.

15:58.290 --> 15:58.580
That's called infamous.

16:00.160 --> 16:02.290
You're also pretty infamous
with some members of my gang.

16:02.330 --> 16:04.290
I don't know if you heard,
but I'm running with

16:04.330 --> 16:05.880
the Chevaliers these days.

16:05.920 --> 16:06.250
Yeah! Congratulations.

16:07.590 --> 16:10.300
I told Taylor that you're
helping me with the -

16:11.050 --> 16:11.970
With the diamonds.

16:13.680 --> 16:14.680
Wrap it up ladies.

16:16.010 --> 16:18.930
Taylor thinks that Marko
might have taken my key.

16:18.970 --> 16:20.430
And stashed it somewhere.

16:20.480 --> 16:20.770
Let me ask you.

16:22.310 --> 16:25.520
Why are you being so generous
in your help towards Seth.

16:25.560 --> 16:29.730
Rankin's a good guy.
Marko, not so much.

16:29.780 --> 16:32.740
Thank you. We can trust him.
I mean look at that face.

16:32.780 --> 16:33.070
That's a face you can trust.

16:34.490 --> 16:36.280
I wouldn't trust Taylor as far
as I can throw him.

16:36.320 --> 16:36.530
And trust me,
that's pretty far.

16:37.870 --> 16:39.160
You need to choose your
words more carefully-

16:39.200 --> 16:40.830
When you speak to me in here.

16:40.870 --> 16:41.160
Yeah, Jake. Come on.

16:42.750 --> 16:44.210
Taylor: Marko spends a lot of
time in the prison Rec Room.

16:44.250 --> 16:46.460
If there's a meeting
happening, here's there.

16:46.500 --> 16:49.960
And I take the anger management
meetings down there.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.970
Actually, there's one
happening there today.

16:52.010 --> 16:52.340
Later on.

16:53.800 --> 16:55.640
Taylor: Big room. Lots of
places you can hide an item.

16:55.680 --> 16:57.510
If you catch my drift.

16:57.550 --> 16:59.390
Thanks for the tip. Now.

16:59.430 --> 17:00.890
Drift away.

17:00.930 --> 17:03.980
Like I said, anything for my
good buddy Seth.

17:06.480 --> 17:06.690
Nice guy.

17:07.650 --> 17:08.770
What the hell is
wrong with you?

17:08.820 --> 17:10.860
What's wrong there Jake buddy?

17:10.900 --> 17:12.900
Aye, aye, aye!

17:12.940 --> 17:13.200
Now listen.

17:14.820 --> 17:16.870
I'm only working for you because
because I need the bail money.

17:16.910 --> 17:18.450
Do you understand? So-

17:19.870 --> 17:21.660
Seth, do not cross me.

17:21.700 --> 17:25.500
Jake, come on. I mean,
we're a team, right?

17:25.540 --> 17:26.960
I want what you wants.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.340
We'll see about that.

17:48.810 --> 17:50.730
One Direction are a legit
musical group.

17:51.360 --> 17:52.320
Any movement yet?

17:52.360 --> 17:52.690
What? Yeah. No.

17:54.190 --> 17:57.910
No. I was. I've been watching
all day. She's a lock in.

17:57.950 --> 17:58.240
You were asleep.

17:59.490 --> 18:02.040
No! I wasn't. I was watching.
And then I-

18:02.080 --> 18:04.080
Fell asleep half way through.

18:04.120 --> 18:04.330
Mal:
If Jake is right,

18:05.620 --> 18:07.170
there could be some bad
people after this girl.

18:07.210 --> 18:09.460
Des! You have to stay
on top of this!

18:09.500 --> 18:11.500
Okay!

18:11.540 --> 18:13.920
What do you guys want?

18:13.960 --> 18:14.880
Seth's not here.

18:14.920 --> 18:15.840
Hey.

18:15.880 --> 18:17.590
Arrgh!

18:17.630 --> 18:17.930
Who are you?

18:19.470 --> 18:22.600
Molly. We're not looking for
Seth. We're working for him.

18:22.640 --> 18:23.890
We're here to protect you.

18:23.930 --> 18:24.220
Ahhh! My eyes!

18:25.600 --> 18:31.110
I can't hear anything! Can
anyone hear me? Hello?

18:31.150 --> 18:31.480
Seth sent you?

18:32.610 --> 18:34.070
Seth is serving time with
my son Jake-

18:34.110 --> 18:35.360
Who's helping him
recover the key.

18:35.400 --> 18:36.690
We're here in case
anyone comes

18:36.740 --> 18:38.030
after you and
that other key.

18:38.070 --> 18:39.320
Tell Tinny I love her, b'ys.

18:41.280 --> 18:42.700
Why didn't you just say so?

18:51.670 --> 18:52.710
Seth:
You came. Thanks.

18:53.590 --> 18:55.630
I gotta say, I was kind of -

18:55.670 --> 18:57.840
it's a bit of an odd place to
hide my key, isn't it?

18:57.880 --> 18:58.180
Actually, it's kind
of perfect.

18:59.430 --> 19:00.970
There's no no security
cameras in the room.

19:01.010 --> 19:02.220
Except for that one.

19:03.140 --> 19:04.640
That looks like it's turned off.

19:04.680 --> 19:06.390
They mustn't record
the sessions in here.

19:06.430 --> 19:08.390
Gives Marko a bit of time to go
about his business.

19:08.430 --> 19:10.140
Yeah. Like stashing my key.

19:10.190 --> 19:11.560
Among other things I'm sure.

19:11.600 --> 19:11.900
After I get the meeting started,

19:13.110 --> 19:14.320
that's when you can
start your snooping.

19:14.360 --> 19:15.150
Anger management, huh?

19:16.650 --> 19:18.940
Too bad you didn't take it
before you killed the mayor.

19:18.990 --> 19:22.780
Wait. Did you kill the mayor,
or what that someone else?

19:23.530 --> 19:24.830
Can't quite remember.

19:24.870 --> 19:26.330
Leave us alone Brogan.

19:27.330 --> 19:29.290
You're a dead man
in here Jake.

19:31.370 --> 19:33.710
Okay. So just follow my lead.

19:33.750 --> 19:36.460
And, this might be
good for you.

19:36.500 --> 19:37.920
So, just go with it.

19:47.850 --> 19:48.180
Marko: Seth, are we
doing this thing?

19:49.600 --> 19:51.560
Or are we gonna talk all day
with your new squeeze.

19:51.600 --> 19:54.690
Seth: Okay. Let's
start the meeting

19:54.730 --> 19:58.070
in the usual way, with
a minute of silence.

20:10.580 --> 20:10.910
Here.

20:12.500 --> 20:15.250
Thank you. It's like my eyes
literally came out of my head.

20:15.290 --> 20:17.340
But they can't because they're
connected somehow.

20:17.380 --> 20:19.340
Mal: Jake is helping Seth
look for the stolen key.

20:19.380 --> 20:20.920
He said you had
the second one.

20:24.590 --> 20:25.890
I never wanted any of this.

20:25.930 --> 20:27.390
Why don't you just
reason with him?

20:27.430 --> 20:27.640
Ha!

20:29.270 --> 20:30.430
Tell him to go to the cops and
tell him where the diamonds are.

20:30.480 --> 20:31.520
It could shorten his term.

20:31.560 --> 20:31.690
He won't listen.

20:32.640 --> 20:32.890
God knows who he's told in that

20:33.850 --> 20:34.060
jail about the
missing jewelry.

20:35.690 --> 20:37.860
And now thanks to him I have to
be protected by you two clowns.

20:37.900 --> 20:40.900
Whoa. We're not clowns. Okay?
Clowns get paid.

20:40.940 --> 20:41.860
I'm sorry.

20:41.900 --> 20:42.780
I'm just scared.

20:44.910 --> 20:45.240
He's a beautiful man, my Seth.

20:46.530 --> 20:47.990
But he's not the sharpest
knife in the drawer.

20:48.030 --> 20:49.740
Mal: Don't worry. We'll
keep an eye on him.

20:49.790 --> 20:50.790
'Til Jake finds the key.

20:50.830 --> 20:51.710
Cool.

20:52.210 --> 20:53.290
Sorry.

20:56.540 --> 20:58.000
Seth: And the
meeting has begun.

20:58.040 --> 21:00.340
We have a newcomer,
right there in the back.

21:00.380 --> 21:03.220
Would you like to
introduce yourself.

21:03.260 --> 21:03.550
No.

21:05.140 --> 21:08.510
Yeah. Just say hi. My name's
Jake. And I have anger issues.

21:11.020 --> 21:14.230
This is a place of sanctity.
There's no judgment here.

21:14.270 --> 21:16.230
Sorry, just wanted to
help the newcomer.

21:16.270 --> 21:18.650
Because I know for a fact that
he's angry with me.

21:19.520 --> 21:20.980
Come on. Tell 'em why, Jake.

21:21.400 --> 21:22.740
Well.

21:24.240 --> 21:26.530
I'm accused of
killing, probably,

21:26.570 --> 21:27.910
our worst mayor
in the city's history.

21:28.990 --> 21:30.660
I suppose with all
the real estate

21:30.700 --> 21:32.370
developments that
have been going on -

21:32.410 --> 21:34.160
It only would have
been a matter of time,

21:34.210 --> 21:34.500
before he was offed anyway.

21:36.120 --> 21:38.710
Seth: That's a little extreme.
You don't have to go that far.

21:38.750 --> 21:41.130
Brogan here. Brogan-

21:42.010 --> 21:42.920
He tried to have me killed.

21:44.380 --> 21:46.130
And he's the sole reason that
the woman that I love

21:46.180 --> 21:48.050
is fighting for her life in
a hospital bed.

21:48.760 --> 21:52.350
He buried her alive.

21:53.390 --> 21:54.850
And that makes
me very,

21:54.890 --> 21:56.100
very, very, angry.

21:56.140 --> 21:56.350
That's conjecture, Jake.

21:57.850 --> 21:59.310
Leslie Bennett's the only one
who could confirm that.

21:59.360 --> 21:59.650
And she's on death's door.

22:00.980 --> 22:03.440
Seth: Guys, can we just
stay away from names.

22:03.480 --> 22:06.200
And specifics about
others in the room.

22:06.240 --> 22:08.030
I'm just saying,
the hilarious thing

22:08.070 --> 22:10.530
is that Brogan is
the one responsible

22:10.580 --> 22:11.950
for killing the dead mayor.

22:11.990 --> 22:12.950
Isn't that right, Brogan.

22:12.990 --> 22:13.950
Proof, Jake.

22:14.000 --> 22:14.290
The law needs proof.

22:15.460 --> 22:17.750
Whoa, whoa. Everyone
remain calm, okay?

22:17.790 --> 22:18.080
Jake.
Come on now.

22:19.420 --> 22:21.800
I head him talking with a
guard just the other day

22:22.880 --> 22:24.630
See, he's gonna
keep an eye on all

22:24.670 --> 22:26.260
you bikers and you too, Marko-

22:26.300 --> 22:27.380
For the warden.

22:27.430 --> 22:28.380
Alright. Everyone remain calm.

22:28.430 --> 22:28.640
Brogan:
He's lying.

22:29.550 --> 22:31.140
What you're doing is pathetic.

22:31.180 --> 22:33.220
I also heard Marko
talking to the guards.

22:33.260 --> 22:35.430
He was telling some tales
about you bikers as well.

22:35.480 --> 22:36.940
They're all rats, b'ys.

22:38.390 --> 22:39.480
What are you playing at, Doyle.

22:40.440 --> 22:42.230
Seth:
Everyone remain calm!

22:42.270 --> 22:44.150
Use your relaxation skills.

22:46.280 --> 22:48.070
What are you doing
with that Doyle?

22:51.320 --> 22:52.530
What are you doing with that?

22:57.080 --> 22:58.500
You're gonna pay
for that, Doyle.

22:58.540 --> 23:00.370
I swear to God.
You're gonna pay for that.

23:00.420 --> 23:00.750
Guard: Nice detective
work, Doyle.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.420
You found that stash we've
been looking for.

23:03.460 --> 23:06.670
♪♪♪

23:13.930 --> 23:14.220
Mal: Hello?

23:15.640 --> 23:16.430
Okay, Dad. Don't talk. Listen.
I only got a second.

23:17.640 --> 23:19.270
I need you to get me out
of here right away.

23:19.310 --> 23:19.600
I just left you.

23:21.020 --> 23:22.480
How could you get into
trouble in that little time?

23:22.520 --> 23:24.860
I was looking for the key.
And I-

23:24.900 --> 23:27.150
accidentally busted
a drug dealer in here.

23:27.190 --> 23:29.400
And now you're the pen rat
selling out drug dealers.

23:29.450 --> 23:30.360
That's excellent news.

23:30.410 --> 23:31.410
Do you have a will?

23:31.450 --> 23:31.780
I think Seth set me up.

23:33.240 --> 23:34.910
Maybe there wasn't even a
key here in the first place.

23:34.950 --> 23:36.580
We know he robbed
the jewelry store.

23:36.620 --> 23:38.500
We're sure of that. And Molly
has the other key.

23:38.540 --> 23:39.460
I saw it myself.

23:39.500 --> 23:39.830
You talked to her.

23:41.330 --> 23:42.960
She says she tried to reason
with him, but had no luck.

23:43.000 --> 23:46.130
Okay. Stay on her. I
gotta get outta here.

23:46.170 --> 23:48.420
And Seth is my only hope.

23:50.590 --> 23:52.260
Don't let me disturb you.

23:52.300 --> 23:53.180
Bye.

23:54.640 --> 23:55.930
Sorry, Warden.

23:57.770 --> 23:59.100
They don't call me
Warden here.

23:59.140 --> 24:00.770
It's Superintendent.

24:00.810 --> 24:02.560
You found the drugs.
Thanks for helping out.

24:02.600 --> 24:03.900
I wasn't trying to help.

24:03.940 --> 24:04.190
Trust me.

24:05.230 --> 24:05.520
Right now,
there's a hundred fellas

24:06.610 --> 24:06.940
in here going
through withdrawal.

24:08.230 --> 24:09.570
And they're all looking for
someone to blame.

24:09.610 --> 24:10.450
And that's gonna be me.

24:10.490 --> 24:11.610
Don't be naive.

24:11.650 --> 24:11.950
Marko's not the only source.

24:13.070 --> 24:15.620
You're in a precarious
position here.

24:15.660 --> 24:16.990
Seth Rankin.
He's not helping you with

24:17.030 --> 24:18.910
all of his talk of
his pot of gold.

24:20.040 --> 24:20.250
I don't know what you're
talking about.

24:21.500 --> 24:22.500
Seth Rankin is working for
Taylor Gossard.

24:23.920 --> 24:26.460
You were played into
getting Marko's stash- out in

24:26.500 --> 24:29.090
the open to make way for the
biker's business opportunities.

24:29.840 --> 24:31.380
They wanted Marko out.

24:31.420 --> 24:33.220
Seth is helping them.

24:35.180 --> 24:36.140
I'm an idiot.

24:37.930 --> 24:41.060
Well, you're only play is
to take Gossard out.

24:41.100 --> 24:41.390
He's the only drug game left.

24:42.810 --> 24:44.440
Find out how is he getting it
inside these walls.

24:45.690 --> 24:48.270
You want me to take on an
entire Biker gang.

24:48.320 --> 24:51.280
Whether you like it or not, I'm
the only friend you got. So -

24:51.320 --> 24:52.450
I do what I want.

25:00.790 --> 25:03.160
Seth: I did my part, and
now it's time for you to-

25:03.210 --> 25:03.960
You set me up!

25:05.290 --> 25:08.090
Jake. Let me explain.
Taylor here has my key.

25:08.130 --> 25:10.250
He said he'd give it
back to me

25:10.300 --> 25:12.090
as soon as Marko wasn't
able to compete with-

25:12.130 --> 25:13.510
Taylor's drug chain.

25:13.550 --> 25:15.930
But he is yet to hand
it over to me.

25:15.970 --> 25:19.720
And now, I'm the only dealer
left in this beautiful place.

25:19.760 --> 25:21.390
And it's all thanks
to you, Doyle.

25:21.430 --> 25:24.770
And you look like the rat
who brought Marko down.

25:24.810 --> 25:27.150
Win, win for me, old man.

25:30.820 --> 25:31.030
Alright, Taylor.

25:31.940 --> 25:33.240
I'm gonna need that key back.

25:33.280 --> 25:35.200
What you think?
I'm just gonna hand over

25:35.240 --> 25:37.200
two million dollars worth
of uncut diamonds?

25:37.240 --> 25:38.160
They're mine.

25:38.200 --> 25:38.370
They're mine.

25:39.580 --> 25:39.870
I'm not sure we see eye
to eye on that.

25:41.490 --> 25:44.160
I just need to collect the key
from Molly and I'm good to go.

25:44.210 --> 25:45.500
You leave Molly alone.

25:45.540 --> 25:48.210
Try to understand this.
I need that key-

25:48.250 --> 25:50.880
So I can get the bail money. So
I can get the hell out of here,

25:50.920 --> 25:54.630
Now. You hand it over to me
before you turn blue.

25:55.590 --> 25:56.550
Knock it off.

26:03.850 --> 26:05.940
Seth, I know where to find
you, when I need you.

26:05.980 --> 26:06.310
Problem here, fellas?

26:07.400 --> 26:10.020
No. Jake just forgot
where he was.

26:11.150 --> 26:12.780
Won't forget for long.

26:13.480 --> 26:14.900
Got a second?

26:14.940 --> 26:18.820
Yeah, man. I got all the
time in the world.

26:22.120 --> 26:24.120
I feel terrible about this.

26:24.160 --> 26:24.500
I really do.

26:25.580 --> 26:25.870
Thanks to you, I'm
gonna have to tie

26:27.370 --> 26:29.540
my bathroom breaks in unison
with the guards' rotation.

26:29.580 --> 26:31.960
Otherwise I'll get shivved
every time I turn around.

26:32.000 --> 26:33.590
I know. I know. I'm sorry.

26:33.630 --> 26:36.420
But if we can get my key
back from Taylor-

26:36.470 --> 26:39.640
The offer still stands. I
can still make your bail.

26:39.680 --> 26:42.180
If I wasn't so desperate,
there is no way

26:42.220 --> 26:43.720
I would keep helping you.
But I got no other choice.

26:44.720 --> 26:47.770
So, we're still a team?
Yeah?

26:47.810 --> 26:49.600
Great.

26:49.650 --> 26:53.110
Great minds. Working
on stuff together.

26:53.820 --> 26:54.940
Jake. I got a plan.

26:58.320 --> 27:00.280
Des: So Molly hasn't left
yet. That's a good sign.

27:00.320 --> 27:02.870
And I haven' noticed anything
untoward going on around here.

27:02.910 --> 27:05.330
And trust me. I'm really
good like that.

27:06.870 --> 27:10.290
Like the sedan that's been
parked there for three hours?

27:10.330 --> 27:13.420
That was a test, Malachy Doyle.
And good news. You passed.

27:18.880 --> 27:20.340
Okay. I didn't see it.
Please don't.

27:20.970 --> 27:22.350
Come on.

27:23.350 --> 27:24.510
This is gonna be awesome.

27:29.640 --> 27:30.560
Lock pick.

27:30.600 --> 27:31.690
What?

27:31.730 --> 27:32.730
Lock pick?

27:32.770 --> 27:33.650
Oh lock pick.

27:36.570 --> 27:38.320
Keep an eye on the
driver's side door.

27:44.120 --> 27:44.450
Nice.

27:45.990 --> 27:47.660
I don't care what Jake says.
I still think you've got it.

27:49.790 --> 27:51.000
What's in the bag?

27:54.710 --> 27:56.840
She's not hard on the
eyes, huh?

28:04.220 --> 28:08.720
Don't shoot me. Or anyone.
But look like you would.

28:08.770 --> 28:13.150
Would shoot you? Or- yeah.
Don't shoot Mal. Sure.

28:14.060 --> 28:15.020
Now.

28:19.610 --> 28:20.570
[Crash]

28:22.740 --> 28:25.030
What the hell?

28:25.070 --> 28:26.450
Waiting for someone?

28:26.490 --> 28:27.990
Are you sure you
really wanna do this?

28:28.040 --> 28:29.540
You're missing this
gun, aren't you?

28:29.580 --> 28:30.500
Hey!

28:30.540 --> 28:31.540
Arrrgh!

28:31.580 --> 28:32.500
[Bang]

28:32.540 --> 28:34.960
Ah, my eyes!

28:37.840 --> 28:40.010
This is so disconcerting!

28:40.050 --> 28:40.300
You got shot?

28:41.380 --> 28:43.090
Only a few pieces of
the spread. But-

28:43.130 --> 28:44.800
But yes.

28:44.840 --> 28:47.060
Argh!
My eyes! My eyes!

28:47.100 --> 28:48.180
Desmond.

28:48.220 --> 28:49.180
What did I say?!

28:49.220 --> 28:50.220
Not to shoot you.

28:50.270 --> 28:51.640
And what did you do?

28:51.680 --> 28:54.900
I shot you. I shot you?

28:54.940 --> 28:57.320
You were stopping that man
from hurting me, weren't you?

28:57.360 --> 28:58.610
Yep.

29:00.230 --> 29:01.780
And I totally let him
get away.

29:01.820 --> 29:02.740
Yep.

29:06.820 --> 29:07.950
Tell me.

29:10.370 --> 29:12.000
What were you playing at
with Taylor Gossard?

29:12.040 --> 29:12.330
We were just comparing notes.

29:13.830 --> 29:16.710
About what? Which one of you
is the biggest douche bag?

29:16.750 --> 29:18.130
About you, of course.

29:18.170 --> 29:19.630
I got good news.

29:19.670 --> 29:21.960
We decided who gets
to kill you.

29:22.010 --> 29:25.260
It was quite the negotiation
too. So many volunteers.

29:25.300 --> 29:27.220
Sounds like a lot of talk.

29:27.260 --> 29:28.970
But you know what they say.

29:29.010 --> 29:31.680
Actions speak louder
and all that.

29:31.720 --> 29:33.640
Where's the fun in that, Jake?

29:33.680 --> 29:36.020
I'm more of an
unconventional kind of guy.

29:36.060 --> 29:38.810
Meaning you like to stab
people while they're asleep.

29:38.860 --> 29:41.230
Versus doing it straight on,

29:41.280 --> 29:42.730
while you're looking
them in the eye.

29:42.780 --> 29:44.400
Or getting other people
to do my dirty work

29:44.450 --> 29:45.820
while I keep my hands clean.

29:45.860 --> 29:46.200
Classy.

29:47.320 --> 29:47.620
Just because I'm here
on the inside-

29:49.200 --> 29:50.950
Doesn't mean I can't hurt you
out there in the real world.

29:50.990 --> 29:52.750
You think about that.

29:54.540 --> 29:55.620
Now listen.

29:55.660 --> 29:57.670
Do not think for a second,

29:57.710 --> 29:59.790
that I won't kill you
in here if anything

29:59.840 --> 30:02.960
And I mean anything happens
to her. Understand me?

30:03.010 --> 30:04.300
Glad you're worried.

30:04.340 --> 30:06.510
We both know that you're
not a murderer.

30:06.550 --> 30:08.260
I am.

30:08.300 --> 30:10.390
I'm the one who killed
Clark, remember.

30:10.430 --> 30:13.390
Oh, and Leslie? Never
forget Leslie.

30:13.430 --> 30:15.480
You heard what I said, Brogan.

30:16.890 --> 30:19.520
Doesn't just have to be Leslie
that I get to, Jake.

30:19.560 --> 30:21.230
You have a daughter. A niece.

30:21.270 --> 30:24.480
A father. My options
are very robust.

30:24.530 --> 30:28.490
Oh and - by the way, your get
out of jail free card, Seth?

30:28.530 --> 30:32.410
He's headed to the carpentry
shop to talk to Taylor Gossard.

30:39.420 --> 30:39.670
Des shot you?

30:40.920 --> 30:42.960
It was only a few bee bees
from the shell.

30:43.000 --> 30:43.300
I'll be fine.

30:44.380 --> 30:46.050
Where is he? He must
be terrified.

30:46.090 --> 30:48.220
I gave him a time out.
He's over there with Molly.

30:50.090 --> 30:52.470
Hey, listen. I think
that Seth Rankin's

30:52.510 --> 30:54.470
story about robbing
the family store

30:54.510 --> 30:55.970
because he thought his
uncle was gonna

30:56.020 --> 30:57.520
run it into the ground
is totally bogus.

30:57.560 --> 30:59.020
Really?

30:59.060 --> 31:01.060
His uncle is an accomplished
businessman.

31:01.110 --> 31:01.400
He's on the Board of Trade.

31:02.860 --> 31:05.690
He's the former Small
Businessman of the Year. And-

31:05.730 --> 31:08.030
The jewelry store was
doing great.

31:08.070 --> 31:08.360
Even after Seth's father died.

31:09.910 --> 31:11.870
Why did Seth lie to Jake about
why he stole the diamonds?

31:11.910 --> 31:13.530
I don't know. But get this.

31:13.580 --> 31:15.240
I ran that license plate.

31:15.290 --> 31:17.750
Lonny Kent works for the
Chevaliers Biker Club.

31:17.790 --> 31:19.210
Just what we needed.

31:19.250 --> 31:23.130
And I think Molly might
work for them too.

31:23.170 --> 31:25.710
She was running with the
Chevaliers before she met Seth.

31:26.590 --> 31:27.550
Mal:
Follow my lead.

31:29.920 --> 31:33.220
We think Seth lied to Jake
about why he took the diamonds.

31:33.260 --> 31:34.970
Oh? What makes you think that?

31:35.010 --> 31:35.310
Good question.

31:36.560 --> 31:36.890
It doesn't seem like Seth
to lie about that.

31:37.980 --> 31:38.810
Mal: It won't matter
soon. Because

31:38.850 --> 31:40.480
Jake found Seth's key.

31:40.520 --> 31:40.810
He did?

31:42.230 --> 31:44.440
That's great. Now we can put
an end to all of this.

31:44.480 --> 31:47.190
I just need to talk to him
one more time.

31:47.230 --> 31:48.950
Enough is enough.
I'll make him listen.

31:50.990 --> 31:52.490
Okay. I'm confused
and half blind.

31:52.530 --> 31:53.780
But when did Jake find that key?

31:53.820 --> 31:54.120
He didn't.

31:55.160 --> 31:56.290
Des, you know what
to do, right?

31:56.330 --> 31:56.660
Of course.

31:58.120 --> 32:00.250
But you might want to
verbalize it for Rose's sake.

32:00.290 --> 32:01.670
Follow Molly.

32:01.710 --> 32:03.330
Let's see what
she's holding back.

32:03.380 --> 32:05.500
Exactly. Rose!

32:11.720 --> 32:12.970
Taylor. Just leave him alone.

32:13.010 --> 32:15.260
It's all right.
I got this, Jake.

32:15.300 --> 32:17.720
Besides, I owe you
one. So let me handle it.

32:17.760 --> 32:20.350
I was just about to tell
Taylor the plan.

32:20.390 --> 32:21.940
We're going to the cops.

32:21.980 --> 32:24.060
We are not doing anything.

32:24.100 --> 32:25.610
We're especially not
going to the cops.

32:25.650 --> 32:27.270
No way he's gonna
get my diamonds.

32:27.320 --> 32:30.150
I keep telling you, Seth.
They're my diamonds.

32:30.190 --> 32:30.450
Taylor, take it easy.

32:31.820 --> 32:33.950
Taylor: You might recall,
Jake. I'm not a big fan

32:33.990 --> 32:35.620
of confined spaces.

32:35.660 --> 32:37.490
After this -

32:37.530 --> 32:39.950
You won't be too keen
on 'em either.

32:42.960 --> 32:43.830
Jake?

32:46.090 --> 32:47.000
What's-?

32:52.930 --> 32:53.970
Oh no.

32:59.810 --> 33:01.890
Seth, get up. Seth.

33:02.520 --> 33:03.600
Get up out of it.

33:06.310 --> 33:08.570
Aggghh! Why are you trying
to light me on fire?

33:10.190 --> 33:13.400
Door's locked buddy. Between the
door being locked and that fire.

33:13.450 --> 33:15.490
I don't think we're gonna
get out of here.

33:15.530 --> 33:17.160
Oh God.

33:17.200 --> 33:19.830
I made this mess. I'm sorry.

33:19.870 --> 33:21.410
So sorry. Jake?

33:21.450 --> 33:22.870
I need to tell you something.

33:22.910 --> 33:23.120
What?

33:24.040 --> 33:27.290
I didn't rob my uncle's store.

33:27.340 --> 33:29.000
What?

33:29.040 --> 33:31.880
Molly did. And
I took the fall.

33:31.920 --> 33:36.260
You know why? Because I love
her. I love her.

33:36.300 --> 33:38.010
Why didn't you tell me
that little detail?

33:38.050 --> 33:40.060
Because I didn't want you
to be mad at me.

33:40.100 --> 33:44.180
And because I look up
to you, Jake.

33:44.230 --> 33:46.100
And look at you.
You're a private detective.

33:46.150 --> 33:47.690
And I'm nuttin'.

33:47.730 --> 33:49.900
Nuttin'!

33:50.650 --> 33:52.820
Let's get this fire out.

33:53.570 --> 33:54.490
Jake:
No, no, no!!

33:54.530 --> 33:56.780
Arrgh!

33:56.820 --> 33:59.450
[Fire alarm rings]

34:08.130 --> 34:09.920
[Fire alarm rings]

34:47.910 --> 34:51.130
So I imagine this will get me
into the good books.

34:52.540 --> 34:54.380
You never know, cutie.

34:57.420 --> 34:59.010
Yeah. Don't call me cutie.

35:02.010 --> 35:04.260
I changed my mind. Prison is

35:04.310 --> 35:06.100
scarier than I
thought it would be.

35:09.940 --> 35:10.150
Hi.

35:11.270 --> 35:11.610
Molly's meeting with
Taylor Gossard.

35:12.730 --> 35:13.110
And I think he just
gave her the key.

35:14.360 --> 35:14.650
Superintendent Barton: I know it was them.

35:16.070 --> 35:17.530
But there's no way to prove
that Brogan or Gossard

35:17.570 --> 35:19.030
were behind trying to
have you killed.

35:19.070 --> 35:20.990
It's your word against
everybody else's.

35:21.030 --> 35:21.740
There's a surprise.

35:23.030 --> 35:25.040
Nobody wants to be seen
siding with the Rat.

35:25.080 --> 35:25.290
Speaking of -

35:26.910 --> 35:29.210
I was under the assumption that
you and I had an understanding.

35:29.250 --> 35:32.250
-You were wrong.
-You find out

35:32.290 --> 35:33.380
how Gossard's getting
the drugs into

35:33.420 --> 35:34.800
my prison and I keep you alive.

35:34.840 --> 35:36.380
I'm keeping up my end of
the bargain.

35:36.420 --> 35:38.210
Taylor just tried to have
me killed. And I'm

35:38.260 --> 35:40.090
pretty sure the minute
I walk out that door-

35:40.130 --> 35:41.760
he's gonna try to have
me killed again.

35:41.800 --> 35:42.140
I can put him in
the hole for a week.

35:43.390 --> 35:45.100
Maybe two so you can find
the drug pipeline.

35:45.140 --> 35:45.310
That is a bad idea.

35:46.970 --> 35:49.020
You put Taylor in the hole and
his friends will put me in one.

35:49.060 --> 35:50.190
Permanently.

35:54.900 --> 35:55.900
Wait a minute.

36:01.200 --> 36:03.700
Who runs the recycling program
in here? Inmates?

36:03.740 --> 36:05.030
Yes. Carpentry shop inmates.

36:05.080 --> 36:05.410
Why?

36:06.990 --> 36:09.120
I'm gonna need you to get me
into the Carp Shop right away.

36:14.580 --> 36:16.380
So. I guess you're
done with Seth.

36:16.420 --> 36:16.710
You don't understand.

36:17.840 --> 36:19.210
And to think I let you
mace me twice.

36:19.260 --> 36:21.380
Please. Yes, I stole
the diamonds.

36:21.430 --> 36:22.680
But I did it
for Seth.

36:22.720 --> 36:23.010
No you didn't.

36:24.470 --> 36:26.970
We know you were working with
the bikers all along.

36:27.010 --> 36:28.270
But you weren't planning on Seth

36:28.310 --> 36:30.560
going to jail with
one of the keys.

36:30.600 --> 36:31.690
Seth Rankin's an idiot.

36:32.980 --> 36:34.560
You're playing games
with my son's life.

36:34.610 --> 36:35.940
That makes you the idiot.

36:37.110 --> 36:38.230
Officer.

36:42.740 --> 36:43.660
Well.

36:43.700 --> 36:45.070
Not a bad day's work.

36:45.120 --> 36:48.290
No one got hurt. Too much.

36:49.160 --> 36:50.620
While the cops are here-

36:52.160 --> 36:55.120
I should probably give them a
statement about my injury.

36:55.170 --> 36:57.750
Just to have it on the record
for insurance reasons.

36:57.790 --> 36:59.920
What? No! I'm not Jake.
I can't go to prison.

36:59.960 --> 37:01.590
You can shoot me.
Not in the face.

37:01.630 --> 37:01.970
Maybe the bum.

37:03.220 --> 37:08.560
Des. Next time, make sure
I'm down for good.

37:08.600 --> 37:12.100
Because if I get up out of it,
you're a dead man.

37:20.820 --> 37:22.780
What are we doing in here?

37:22.820 --> 37:23.110
What are we looking for?

37:24.410 --> 37:27.030
Oh, my key. You think
it's in here, do you.

37:27.070 --> 37:28.990
Can you just knock it
off and shut up.

37:29.030 --> 37:29.910
Nice.

37:35.420 --> 37:37.670
Taylor: So you survived
the burning closet.

37:37.710 --> 37:40.340
Funny, I thought it was cats
that had nine lives.

37:40.380 --> 37:42.880
But I guess that applies
to Rats as well.

37:45.010 --> 37:46.010
What do you think?

37:46.050 --> 37:48.180
Honestly Taylor. I don't-

37:48.220 --> 37:50.680
think this lipstick
is your shade.

37:51.520 --> 37:53.980
Something about this can.

37:55.060 --> 37:56.190
The weight of it.

38:01.980 --> 38:06.610
Wow. Using the wives-

38:06.650 --> 38:11.200
and girlfriends to smuggle
this in through the garbage.

38:11.240 --> 38:11.450
Seth:
That's pretty smart.

38:13.080 --> 38:15.830
And it will be our little secret
if you just give me my key, now.

38:15.870 --> 38:18.580
Seth's pretty missus
has the key.

38:18.630 --> 38:21.960
And right about now.
She got our diamonds too.

38:24.010 --> 38:24.920
What?

38:24.970 --> 38:26.550
Wha?

38:26.590 --> 38:29.720
You're girlfriend works for
the Chevaliers.

38:29.760 --> 38:32.220
Ya tool. Why did you think
someone as hot as that would

38:32.260 --> 38:34.350
take up with the
likes of you anyhow?

38:34.390 --> 38:35.640
Molly was in on it.

38:35.680 --> 38:37.730
She planned the whole thing.

38:37.770 --> 38:39.770
Seth kept getting in the way.

38:39.810 --> 38:41.110
Idiot.

38:41.150 --> 38:42.770
Old Molly worked out
a great deal

38:42.820 --> 38:44.400
with the Chevalier Biker Gang.

38:44.440 --> 38:45.150
And as a member,

38:46.530 --> 38:49.320
I'd like to thank you for
helping make it happen.

38:49.360 --> 38:51.580
Jake: Trapped in a room
with inmates and a bunch of

38:52.490 --> 38:52.700
pointy stuff.

38:53.870 --> 38:56.120
Yep. The horoscope is
right on today.

39:05.380 --> 39:06.550
No! Jake!

39:06.590 --> 39:07.510
Arrgh!

39:15.310 --> 39:17.140
Taylor:
Okay.

39:17.180 --> 39:18.100
Okay Jake.

39:19.270 --> 39:20.230
Don't do it.

39:20.650 --> 39:21.650
Arrgh!

39:29.650 --> 39:31.360
Seth. Buddy, are you okay?

39:31.410 --> 39:33.620
It's not too bad. It's just an
internal flesh wound.

39:33.660 --> 39:33.910
Sorry about Molly.

39:35.370 --> 39:38.410
Now you see what a man will do
for the love of a woman.

39:39.870 --> 39:42.830
And what a woman will do for a
shitload of diamonds.

39:42.880 --> 39:45.300
We were a good team,
though Jake!

39:45.340 --> 39:47.760
Taylor: You almost
cut my nose off, man!

39:47.800 --> 39:48.090
Actually-

39:49.220 --> 39:50.880
I think this is a
much better look.

39:50.930 --> 39:51.590
You smile now, Jake.

39:52.800 --> 39:53.100
You won't be smiling in
an hour's time.

39:54.680 --> 39:56.560
You take something from me.
I'll take something from you.

39:56.600 --> 39:58.980
See, I made a new
friend in here.

39:59.020 --> 40:00.600
And he needed a favor.

40:03.770 --> 40:04.610
Brogan.

40:05.610 --> 40:07.530
Mackey.
I gotta use the phone.

40:37.680 --> 40:39.640
Drop the knife. Now.

40:42.730 --> 40:44.020
You heard her.

40:52.400 --> 40:54.030
Did Brogan put you up to this?

40:54.070 --> 40:56.450
It helps to be friends
with the Chevaliers.

40:58.910 --> 40:59.250
That was way too close.

41:00.750 --> 41:02.540
If Jake didn't call, who knows
what would have happened?

41:10.260 --> 41:12.800
It's okay, Leslie.
We've got your back.

41:32.190 --> 41:33.320
Jake: So she's awake?

41:33.360 --> 41:34.490
How is she?

41:34.530 --> 41:34.780
Mal: She's groggy.

41:36.160 --> 41:37.620
But the doctors say she's
gonna pull out of this.

41:37.660 --> 41:39.240
So it looks good.

41:39.280 --> 41:40.620
Looks really good, son.

41:41.990 --> 41:46.080
That's the best news I've
heard in my entire life.

41:46.120 --> 41:48.710
We're just lucky you called to
keep that man from hurting her.

41:48.750 --> 41:50.500
Brogan was the one
behind this, Dad.

41:50.550 --> 41:53.170
He got Taylor to put the
hit out on Leslie.

41:53.220 --> 41:54.420
Looks that way.

41:54.470 --> 41:55.630
But his hit man isn't talking.

41:55.680 --> 41:57.010
If I see him in here,

41:57.050 --> 41:58.090
I don't know if
I'm gonna be able

41:58.140 --> 41:59.810
to stop myself from killing him.

41:59.850 --> 42:00.890
Try not doin' that.

42:02.810 --> 42:03.180
Yeah.

42:04.640 --> 42:06.190
Guess what Leslie's first word
was when she woke up?

42:06.230 --> 42:07.900
What?

42:08.310 --> 42:09.230
Malachy.

42:10.270 --> 42:11.730
Joking.

42:11.780 --> 42:14.150
She said your name. Hey.

42:14.190 --> 42:16.490
Stay away from Brogan.
Love you.

42:16.530 --> 42:22.200
Yeah. Me too. Thanks.
