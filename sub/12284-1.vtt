I TOLD YOU YOU GOT TO
BRING UP THE EXPLOSIONS.

14:37.677 --> 14:39.146
THEY'VE GOT TO BE LOUD.

14:39.179 --> 14:42.983
THE AUDIENCE SHOULD FEEL
THEIR BALLS TREMBLE.

14:43.016 --> 14:46.186
SO I DON'T CARE IF
GOD TOLD YOU TO KEEP IT DOWN.

14:46.219 --> 14:48.155

WAITING FOR YOU
FOR 15 MINUTES.

16:10.703 --> 16:13.206

16:13.240 --> 16:16.509
IF THEY CAN'T START
A MEETING WITHOUT YOU,

16:16.543 --> 16:19.146

ENORMOUS OPPORTUNITIES
FOR THE BOTH OF US,

JUST SIT AND CHAT.

17:39.659 --> 17:42.295

17:45.198 --> 17:48.601
NO. THIS IS NOT

IT'S NOT
THE SAME THING, IS IT?

17:58.211 --> 18:01.681
WELL, I THINK
THEY BOTH CONTAIN--

18:01.714 --> 18:04.384
WHAT EQUAL CONTAINS
IS NOT MY CONCERN HERE.

18:04.417 --> 18:06.786
I DON'T CARE IF IT HAS
FUCKING FAIRY DUST IN IT.

18:12.725 --> 18:15.195
WHAT I AM CONCERNED
WITH IS DETAIL.

18:15.228 --> 18:17.197
I ASKED FOR
SWEET 'N LOW.

18:17.230 --> 18:18.698
YOU BRING ME BACK EQUAL.

18:18.731 --> 18:20.700
THAT ISN'T WHAT I ASKED FOR,

18:20.733 --> 18:23.170
AND THAT SHIT ISN'T
GOING TO WORK AROUND HERE.

HOW THINGS WORK AROUND HERE,

18:37.217 --> 18:38.585
SO I WILL TELL YOU.

18:41.221 --> 18:46.193
YOU HAVE NO BRAIN.

18:46.226 --> 18:48.728
NO JUDGMENT CALLS
ARE NECESSARY.

18:48.761 --> 18:51.698
WHAT YOU THINK
MEANS NOTHING.

18:51.731 --> 18:55.202

MEANS NOTHING.

18:55.235 --> 18:56.703
YOU ARE HERE FOR ME.

18:56.736 --> 18:59.706

TO PROTECT MY INTERESTS

18:59.739 --> 19:01.341

19:01.374 --> 19:04.611
WHILE IT MAY LOOK LIKE
A LITTLE THING TO YOU,

19:04.644 --> 19:09.682
WHEN I ASK FOR
A PACKET OF SWEET 'N LOW...

IN A SECOND.

20:14.747 --> 20:16.549

EVERYTHING READY.

20:16.583 --> 20:17.617
ANTICIPATE.

20:17.650 --> 20:20.720

AND SERVE HIS NEEDS.

20:29.028 --> 20:30.697
O.K., BUT THAT'S CRAZY.

20:30.730 --> 20:32.999
THAT'S NO WAY
TO RUN A BUSINESS.

20:33.032 --> 20:35.001
UH-UH.
FIRST MISTAKE.

20:35.034 --> 20:37.704
THIS IS NOT
A BUSINESS.

20:37.737 --> 20:39.706
NO RULES HERE.

20:39.739 --> 20:41.708
SAVE THAT

20:46.746 --> 20:50.983
PUNCHING BELOW THE BELT
IS NOT ONLY ALL RIGHT...

20:52.552 --> 20:55.855
IT IS REWARDED.

20:55.888 --> 20:58.725
SO IN THIS,
THIS BUSINESS OF SHOW,

20:58.758 --> 21:00.593
YOU GOT TO ASK YOURSELF,

21:00.627 --> 21:03.963
WHAT IS IT THAT

21:03.996 --> 21:06.399
SIT UP AND TAKE NOTICE
OF YOU?

THAT POT OF COFFEE

21:25.952 --> 21:28.020
COME ON, ROLL UP
YOUR SLEEVES.

THIS PONY IS GOING TO
WIN, PLACE, OR SHOW.

26:10.803 --> 26:14.907
EVEN THE TITLE,
REAL LIFE.
IT'S A REAL PASS.

26:14.941 --> 26:16.776
YOU NEED
THIS FILM, BUDDY.

26:16.809 --> 26:19.779
IT'S AN IMPORTANT FILM

26:19.812 --> 26:22.081
YOU CANNOT KEEP DISSING
WHAT THEY WANT TO SEE.

26:22.114 --> 26:23.916

ABOUT THAT, GUY?

26:23.950 --> 26:26.352
YOU'RE AT THAT AGE.

26:34.426 --> 26:37.997
DISPOSABLE.

26:38.030 --> 26:40.833
THANKS, AND THIS IS TOO DARK,
DEPRESSING, AND DULL.

26:40.867 --> 26:43.069
IT'S NOT WHAT
PEOPLE WANT TO SEE.

26:43.102 --> 26:45.404
I SUPPOSE
THAT PUMPED UP,

26:45.437 --> 26:47.073
OVER-ADRENALIZED
MALE MACHO
BULLSHIT IS?

26:47.106 --> 26:50.076
MY MALE MACHO BULLSHIT
JUST BROKE 180 MIL.

26:50.109 --> 26:52.078
THE LAST IMPORTANT FILM
THIS STUDIO MADE

26:52.111 --> 26:53.780
PEAKED AT 18.

26:53.813 --> 26:55.748
THE ONE BEFORE THAT DIDN'T
EVEN BREAK DOUBLE DIGITS.

26:55.782 --> 27:00.720
DAWN, FORGET ABOUT THIS
LOST ARTSY GENERATION CRAP.

27:00.753 --> 27:03.089
YOU'VE BEEN AWAY
FROM ME TOO LONG.

27:03.122 --> 27:05.091
COME BACK TO MY TEAM,

27:05.124 --> 27:07.093
AND WE CAN MAKE
SOME REAL MOVIES.

27:07.126 --> 27:09.796
OR I COULD JUST GO
TO STELLA WITH IT.

27:09.829 --> 27:12.131
SHE IS PRESIDENT
OF PRODUCTION,
RIGHT?

27:12.164 --> 27:14.233
HM-MMM, FOR NOW.

27:20.840 --> 27:23.242
CYRUS? AND YOU
DIDN'T PUT HIM THROUGH?

27:23.275 --> 27:26.378
YOU SAID
HOLD ALL YOUR CALLS.

27:26.412 --> 27:28.781
FINE. WHO ELSE?

27:28.815 --> 27:33.385

27:36.823 --> 27:38.791
YOU SAID TO HOLD
ALL YOUR CALLS.
I DIDN'T KNOW.

27:38.825 --> 27:41.127
YOU DIDN'T KNOW?

27:41.160 --> 27:43.796
YOU DIDN'T HEAR ME
WHEN I SAID VERY IMPORTANT?

27:43.830 --> 27:45.765
WHAT GOOD ARE YOU?
DO YOU HAVE A BRAIN?

27:45.798 --> 27:47.867
DO YOU WANT THIS JOB?

27:47.900 --> 27:50.336
SHUT UP, LISTEN, LEARN!
FUCK YOUR DISAPPOINTMENT!

27:50.369 --> 27:53.039
FUCK YOUR DISILLUSIONMENT
AND FUCK YOU!

27:53.072 --> 27:54.974

FUCKING PRICK!

27:55.007 --> 27:56.275
WELL, ISN'T THIS
TURNING INTO

27:56.308 --> 27:57.810
AN INTELLIGENT
CONVERSATION.

27:57.844 --> 28:02.181
LOUD AND NASTY. THAT'S
THE ONLY WAY IT STICKS, DAWN.

28:02.214 --> 28:05.051
YOU DID SAY,
"HOLD ALL MY CALLS,"
BUDDY.

28:05.084 --> 28:07.319
AND I CERTAINLY HOPE
YOU WOULDN'T WANT

28:07.353 --> 28:09.088
ANYONE TO INTRUDE ON
OUR TIME TOGETHER.

28:16.128 --> 28:18.798
HM-MMM.

28:18.831 --> 28:20.432
FIND CYRUS. FIND STELLA.
GET THEM ON THE PHONE.

28:20.466 --> 28:23.803
IF THEY AREN'T ON THE LINE
BY THE TIME I GET BACK,

28:23.836 --> 28:25.437
YOU'D BETTER NOT
BE HERE, EITHER.

28:25.471 --> 28:28.407
I'LL GET BACK TO YOU ABOUT THIS.
LET ME THINK ABOUT IT,

28:28.440 --> 28:32.979
AND, UM,
LET'S GET TOGETHER SOON.

28:33.012 --> 28:36.215
BUDDY ACKERMAN'S
OFFICE CALLING.

28:36.248 --> 28:38.818
AS I WAS SAYING
ABOUT THAT LITTLE
MISUNDERSTANDING,

28:38.851 --> 28:40.953
WHY DON'T YOU LET ME
MAKE IT UP TO YOU?

28:40.987 --> 28:42.955
HOW ABOUT LUNCH?

28:42.989 --> 28:45.825
THANK YOU,
BUT I REALLY--I CAN'T.

28:45.858 --> 28:47.860
LOOK, I'M GOING TO
BE REAL BLUNT HERE.

28:47.894 --> 28:50.797
AS MUCH AS I HATE
IT, I NEED BUDDY.

28:50.830 --> 28:53.800
I NEED MY CALLS
TO FIND THEIR WAY
TO HIS PHONE SHEET.

28:53.833 --> 28:55.167
I NEED MY SCRIPTS
TO GO HOME WITH HIM.

28:55.201 --> 28:57.804
IN SHORT, I NEED YOU
ON MY SIDE.

28:57.837 --> 28:59.105
SEE WHAT I'M SAYING?

28:59.138 --> 29:01.808
I DON'T WANT
TO BE PUT ON HOLD

29:01.841 --> 29:03.810
OVER A PARKING SPOT.

29:03.843 --> 29:06.078
SO WHY DON'T WE
JUST TRY THIS AGAIN?

29:06.112 --> 29:09.315
HEY,
HOW ABOUT LUNCH?

29:09.348 --> 29:12.451
WELL...

29:12.484 --> 29:15.021
I'M NOT ALLOWED
TO TAKE LUNCH.

29:15.054 --> 29:18.490
UM...BUDDY DOESN'T
BELIEVE IN IT.

29:18.524 --> 29:22.228
FINE. DRINKS IT IS.
HERE'S MY CARD.

29:22.261 --> 29:24.130
CALL ME WHEN
YOU'RE DONE TONIGHT,
ALL RIGHT?

29:24.163 --> 29:25.297
TONIGHT?

29:27.366 --> 29:29.101
THAT'S ALL RIGHT
WITH YOU, ISN'T IT?

29:29.135 --> 29:31.871
OH, YEAH.
IT JUST SEEMS...

29:31.904 --> 29:33.472
THAT A WOMAN
AS POWERFUL

29:33.505 --> 29:35.507
AND AS ATTRACTIVE

29:35.541 --> 29:39.311
AND AS PLEASANT-NATURED
AS YOURSELF

29:39.345 --> 29:42.014
WOULD BE BOOKED UP
FOR TONIGHT.

29:42.048 --> 29:44.350
WELL, GUESS WHAT.
I AM NOW.

29:47.019 --> 29:48.888
YOU KNOW WHAT?
A PIECE OF ADVICE.

29:48.921 --> 29:50.890
YOU SHOULD TALK
TO HIM ABOUT
THE YELLING.

29:50.923 --> 29:53.059
IT KIND OF MAKES YOU
LOOK LIKE A SCHMUCK.

30:04.871 --> 30:06.338
YEAH, SOME TIP.

30:06.372 --> 30:09.608
YOU OUGHT TO BE SHOT
FOR SCARING ME THAT EARLY.

30:09.641 --> 30:12.111
THE CHANGE STELLA WANTS?
IT'S NOT ME.

30:12.144 --> 30:14.180
I'M SURE SHE WOULD
LIKE IT TO BE.

30:14.213 --> 30:16.382
YEAH? WELL,
YOUR SOURCES SUCK.

30:16.415 --> 30:19.151
ANYWAY, TURNS OUT THAT
CYRUS' GRANDSON WAS WHINING

30:19.185 --> 30:20.619
ABOUT HOW ALL
OF TODAY'S FILMS

30:20.652 --> 30:22.121
ARE MADE FOR ADULTS.

30:22.154 --> 30:24.123
THERE'S NOTHING FOR
HIM AND HIS FRIENDS.

30:24.156 --> 30:26.125
THE OLD MAN BITCHED
AND MOANED TO STELLA,

30:26.158 --> 30:28.627
AND NOW WE GOT TO
GO OUT AND FIND

30:28.660 --> 30:30.096
THE NEXT HIPPEST,
HOTTEST THING--

30:30.129 --> 30:31.597
SOMETHING FOR THE KIDS.

30:31.630 --> 30:33.099
ISN'T THAT GREAT?

30:33.132 --> 30:35.134
YOU GOT ANYTHING?

30:35.167 --> 30:37.136
GREAT. SEND IT TO ME.

30:37.169 --> 30:38.404
ALL RIGHT.

30:38.437 --> 30:39.939
BYE-BYE.

30:39.972 --> 30:41.240
YEAH, WHAT?

30:41.273 --> 30:43.275
WELL, I WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU

30:43.309 --> 30:44.610
ABOUT THE PHONE CALLS.

30:44.643 --> 30:46.612
NO APOLOGY NECESSARY.

30:46.645 --> 30:49.181
EVERYONE'S ALLOWED
AT LEAST ONE MISTAKE.

30:49.215 --> 30:51.617
WELL, THAT'S JUST IT.
SEE, I...

30:51.650 --> 30:54.086
I DON'T FEEL THAT
I MADE A MISTAKE,

30:54.120 --> 30:57.456
AND, WELL...

30:57.489 --> 30:59.926
I WOULD APPRECIATE IT
IF YOU DIDN'T YELL AT ME

30:59.959 --> 31:03.429
IN FRONT OF
THE ENTIRE OFFICE.

31:03.462 --> 31:05.631
EXCUSE ME. WHAT?

31:05.664 --> 31:07.433
UH...THE YELLING.

31:07.466 --> 31:09.301
[STAMMERING]

31:14.173 --> 31:16.442
OH.

31:16.475 --> 31:19.378
YOU DISAPPROVE.

31:22.982 --> 31:24.416
I'M SORRY.

31:26.185 --> 31:27.419
DID I...

31:29.188 --> 31:31.090
DID I HURT
YOUR FEELINGS?

31:31.123 --> 31:35.127
NO. NO, NO.

31:37.663 --> 31:40.066
I JUST DON'T FEEL
THAT IT'S NECESSARY.

31:40.099 --> 31:42.068
IT CERTAINLY
DOESN'T HELP ME,
AND I THINK--

31:42.101 --> 31:44.236
WELL, I'M GLAD
YOU BROUGHT THIS UP.

31:44.270 --> 31:45.204
GREAT. GREAT.

31:45.237 --> 31:51.443
BECAUSE I'VE FOUND
THAT AN OFFICE CAN'T RUN...

31:51.477 --> 31:53.345
PROPERLY...

31:53.379 --> 31:55.647
IF THE LINES
OF COMMUNICATION
AREN'T OPEN.

31:55.681 --> 31:57.149
RIGHT. RIGHT.
YES.

31:57.183 --> 31:59.418
SO, IN THAT CASE...

32:02.188 --> 32:04.023
LET'S MAKE
A FEW THINGS CLEAR.

32:04.056 --> 32:06.025
O.K. GREAT. GREAT.

32:06.058 --> 32:07.359
THIS--THIS IS HELPFUL.

32:07.393 --> 32:08.594
I MEAN...

32:08.627 --> 32:10.129
LET'S REVIEW.

32:11.697 --> 32:14.633
WHAT DID I TELL YOU
THE FIRST DAY?

32:14.666 --> 32:17.403
YOUR THOUGHTS
ARE NOTHING.

32:17.436 --> 32:19.638
YOU ARE NOTHING.

32:19.671 --> 32:22.508
AND YET YOU HAVE
THE NERVE TO WALK
INTO MY OFFICE

32:22.541 --> 32:24.010
AND TELL ME--

I WAS SUPPOSED
TO HAVE GONE WITH HER.

01:05:37.367 --> 01:05:39.736
WE HADN'T STARTED
OUR CHRISTMAS
SHOPPING YET,

01:05:39.769 --> 01:05:42.639
BUT IT WAS
GOING TO BE SIMPLE,

01:05:42.672 --> 01:05:44.474
JUST SOME STUFF
FOR OUR PARENTS.

01:05:44.508 --> 01:05:45.976
MONEY WAS TIGHT,

01:05:46.010 --> 01:05:47.978
AND SHOPPING
WAS A HASSLE ANYWAY.

01:05:48.012 --> 01:05:51.348
WE EVEN PROMISED NOT TO
GIVE EACH OTHER GIFTS.

01:05:51.381 --> 01:05:54.651

ALL RIGHT

TO BE PISSED.

TO THE HOSPITAL
