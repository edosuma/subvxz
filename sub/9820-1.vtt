<i>Hey, Frankie, let's go have a picnic.</i>

00:51.385 --> 00:53.308
<i>No, I don't trust you.</i>

00:53.971 --> 00:56.474
<i>I got your favourite cupcakes.</i>

00:59.059 --> 01:00.652
<i>Are they real this time?</i>

01:02.271 --> 01:03.488
<i>Mom!</i>

01:06.108 --> 01:08.987
<i>He's your brother! Your damn brother.</i>

01:12.781 --> 01:13.953
<i>Get over here!</i>

01:14.825 --> 01:17.920
<i>Where'd you get those cameras,
you little fuck?</i>

01:21.540 --> 01:23.963
<i>Where'd you get those cameras?</i>

01:24.376 --> 01:25.593
<i>Did you steal them?</i>

01:29.172 --> 01:31.425
<i>Get back here, you little fucker,
I'm gonna kill you!</i>

02:28.148 --> 02:29.240
Mom. I can't talk.

02:29.399 --> 02:31.072
You sound tense.

02:31.151 --> 02:33.574
I'm not tense. I'm writing.
Can I call you back'?

02:33.737 --> 02:36.490
<i>No, no, no. It'll only take a second.
What're you writing?</i>

02:36.740 --> 02:37.992
What do you think I'm writing, Mom?

02:38.158 --> 02:41.082
Writing books you never finish is
masturbation, Frank.

02:41.328 --> 02:43.922
And I mean that with love,
so don't take it as an insult.

02:46.458 --> 02:49.587
Anyway, there's a party on Friday
for your brother, and he wants you to come.

02:49.753 --> 02:54.805
Mom, I don't see Bruce. I don't talk to Bruce.
You know it, he knows it.

02:55.008 --> 02:57.602
It's been three years now! Get over it.

02:57.678 --> 03:00.522
- Mom, I'm hanging up. I'll call you back.
- Let <i>it</i> go. He's off drugs.

03:01.973 --> 03:05.603
He wanted it to be a surprise.
I know you two have your stuff,

03:06.019 --> 03:09.068
<i>and his counsellor said everyone has
to go through this on their own time.</i>

03:09.147 --> 03:11.741
But if you can come to his graduation thing,
I think you should.

03:14.319 --> 03:19.951
Mom, I just don't think it's a good idea.
I'm really into this book.

03:20.867 --> 03:26.795
And I just started a garden. Looks amazing.
But tell Bruce I'm proud of him.

03:27.416 --> 03:30.215
No, you know what? I'll tell him myself.
I'll write him a letter.

03:30.627 --> 03:35.224
My God. Would you really do that?
And when he finds out you're not coming

03:35.298 --> 03:38.142
and he overdoses in a crack house,
we can read it at his funeral.

03:47.310 --> 03:48.562
Fuck!

04:58.673 --> 05:00.971
There you are! Bruce called.

05:01.051 --> 05:03.145
All the other families are there.
I don't want to be late.

05:03.220 --> 05:04.312
Chris, he's here!

05:04.805 --> 05:05.806
Hi, Mom.

05:06.097 --> 05:08.065
Come on, the "hi" was implied.

05:09.392 --> 05:10.689
A lot of pictures of Bruce.

05:10.811 --> 05:13.655
Bonnie Hubbard's son raped a girl
when he got out of rehab.

05:13.814 --> 05:15.407
We want Bruce to feel loved.

05:15.857 --> 05:17.325
- Sure.
- Chris!

05:17.400 --> 05:18.526
I'm here. Stop yelling.

05:18.610 --> 05:21.739
Why are you wearing the burgundy
when I suggested the blue?

05:21.822 --> 05:22.823
What? You said red.

05:22.906 --> 05:24.829
Tell your son it's time for him
to move back home.

05:24.908 --> 05:25.909
What?

05:25.992 --> 05:29.747
My people are Jewish. Moses led us out
of the desert. It is disrespectful to go back.

05:29.871 --> 05:32.715
Would you please stop picking on him?
If what happened to him at his wedding

05:32.791 --> 05:35.214
happened to you at your wedding,
you'd want to hide in the desert, too.

05:35.293 --> 05:36.294
- Hi, Frankie.
- Hi, Dad.

05:36.378 --> 05:37.504
- So now he's guilty?
- Guilty?

05:37.587 --> 05:38.930
- Who said anything about him being guilty?
- You did!

05:39.005 --> 05:40.529
- And you said it in your own words!
- He's traumatised.

05:40.549 --> 05:42.768
And look at that! That is not a blue sweater,
that's a grey sweater.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.220
We'll have to use your car.

05:46.054 --> 05:47.146
What's wrong with yours?

05:47.222 --> 05:50.101
We don't have cars right now.
Bruce stole them for drugs.

05:50.183 --> 05:51.605
We said we wouldn't tell him!

05:51.685 --> 05:52.857
Who said we wouldn't tell him?

05:52.936 --> 05:56.657
I'm sorry, Bruce stole your cars
and sold them for drugs?

05:56.731 --> 05:58.449
Why are you so hard on your brother?

05:58.900 --> 06:02.655
Drug addiction is a disease. Would you be
mad at somebody because they got cancer?

06:02.904 --> 06:04.656
If they stole my fucking car, I would.

06:04.948 --> 06:08.122
Just don't mention it tonight.
Besides, the mopeds are fine.

06:10.954 --> 06:12.376
They're all we could afford.

06:12.455 --> 06:16.585
Apparently, the insurance company
doesn't consider it theft if it's family.

06:23.633 --> 06:27.479
<i>Hi, my name is Bruce,
and I am an addict and an alcoholic.</i>

06:29.097 --> 06:30.599
<i>Thank you, thank you.</i>

06:31.099 --> 06:33.898
<i>Today's a big day for me.
I've just come out of rehab.</i>

06:34.686 --> 06:36.484
<i>And today I am 90 days sober.</i>

06:38.315 --> 06:39.316
Who's that woman?

06:39.399 --> 06:40.400
<i>Thank you, thank you.</i>

06:40.817 --> 06:41.909
Think I know her.

06:41.985 --> 06:42.986
<i>Thank you, thank you.</i>

06:43.153 --> 06:45.326
<i>- Be quiet.
- Thank you, thank you.</i>

06:46.823 --> 06:51.329
<i>My disease had left me
in a drug-induced sleep.</i>

06:52.495 --> 06:56.875
<i>It was rough. But even then I had a dream.</i>

06:57.000 --> 07:02.177
<i>Just like this guy. Just like old Marty King.
"I had a dream."</i>

07:03.298 --> 07:08.270
<i>My slavery was not picking cotton,
or eating gumbo, or whatever.</i>

07:08.845 --> 07:13.021
<i>But it was gin and it was cocaine.
And I have been released.</i>

07:18.355 --> 07:19.356
<i>Thank you.</i>

07:21.274 --> 07:25.450
<i>Today, I would like to thank Mom and Dad
and Frankie.</i>

07:26.363 --> 07:27.706
<i>This is for you.</i>

07:28.490 --> 07:29.491
<i>Thank you.</i>

07:37.624 --> 07:38.876
There they are!

07:39.000 --> 07:40.172
There he is.

07:43.129 --> 07:44.551
You look so pretty today.

07:44.631 --> 07:45.928
There's my leading man!

07:46.007 --> 07:47.350
Say something, Frankie!

07:47.425 --> 07:49.268
Would you not do that, please?

07:49.427 --> 07:53.557
I'm sorry. I've been waiting three months
to get this puppy back in my hands.

07:53.640 --> 07:56.860
Bruce put his directing career on hold
while he was getting better.

07:56.935 --> 07:58.653
They don't allow cameras in rehab.

07:58.728 --> 07:59.854
Is that really Jack Knoll?

07:59.938 --> 08:01.155
Yeah, I never told you...

08:01.356 --> 08:03.700
Jack! Jack! Come over and meet my family.

08:03.817 --> 08:04.909
Two seconds!

08:05.235 --> 08:06.782
We might be doing a picture together.

08:06.945 --> 08:10.449
With you directing?
Did you hear that? My God!

08:10.949 --> 08:12.951
When did you become a director, Bruce?

08:13.576 --> 08:15.749
Dude, I've been directing my whole life.

08:15.996 --> 08:18.749
Don't you remember all those funny movies
you used to make when you were boys?

08:18.832 --> 08:22.006
He tortured him. Bruce tortured him on film.

08:22.085 --> 08:23.382
That's not true.

08:27.966 --> 08:31.891
It's good to see you.
I haven't seen you since the wedding.

08:32.595 --> 08:33.767
- Rishr.>
- Yup.

08:34.806 --> 08:36.058
You're not still mad about that, are you?

08:38.476 --> 08:39.693
Let's just forget about it, Bruce.

08:39.769 --> 08:42.363
- Right. You don't wanna talk about it?
- Nope, not really.

08:42.438 --> 08:43.907
It's just that I kind of wanted to talk about it.

08:44.024 --> 08:46.368
Do you think it would be okay
just to keep this about now?

08:46.443 --> 08:47.410
That's not a problem.

08:47.485 --> 08:51.490
Jack Knoll. Isn't he that actor with all those
guns? Didn't he shoot somebody'?

08:51.614 --> 08:54.743
Hey! Bruce, your old man's fucking
gossiping about me, man.

08:55.535 --> 08:58.664
I'm just kidding, man. I'm just kidding.
I'm Jack. I love you people.

08:58.955 --> 09:01.378
I just grazed him, didn't really hurt him.

09:01.666 --> 09:05.637
Listen, your son, this man here,
saved my life.

09:06.546 --> 09:11.848
If it hadn't been for him, I would've just
ripped my skull, right above my eyebrows,

09:11.926 --> 09:14.679
just ripped it off
and taken my brains and smashed them out.

09:14.804 --> 09:15.851
This man is a saint.

09:15.972 --> 09:17.565
Those are sweet words. Thank you, Jack.

09:18.224 --> 09:20.898
Bruce, are these your parents?
. Yes.

09:20.977 --> 09:22.570
You must be so proud.

09:23.646 --> 09:25.273
Dharma, this is my family.

09:25.648 --> 09:26.991
Are you in show business?

09:27.192 --> 09:31.447
Mom, this is Dharma D-Cup.
She's been, like, in a billion porn movies.

09:31.696 --> 09:34.040
- Really?
- Yeah, but I'm done with all that.

09:34.324 --> 09:36.292
I'm going to try and get into real acting.

09:37.243 --> 09:38.460
I'm sure you'll be great.

09:38.661 --> 09:39.662
Thanks.

09:39.996 --> 09:41.998
You're a terrific actor.

09:42.624 --> 09:43.625
What?

09:43.750 --> 09:46.674
You. You have a talent.

09:47.754 --> 09:52.476
You, the way you played that comedy.
It's so rare, so special.

09:52.550 --> 09:53.642
You're a great actor.

09:53.968 --> 09:55.345
Thank you. What is he talking about?

09:55.470 --> 09:58.314
The short. The short, man. Superb.

09:58.473 --> 10:00.350
- What short?
- My short.

10:01.976 --> 10:06.026
The short that I shot at UCLA film school, bro.
Remember?

10:06.231 --> 10:07.528
About the wedding.

10:08.566 --> 10:11.069
Right. You showed them my wedding video?

10:11.528 --> 10:14.031
You know what, it's not actually called
<i>My Wedding Video</i> any more.

10:14.114 --> 10:16.742
It's called The <i>Wedding</i> Video
for copyright reasons.

10:21.371 --> 10:23.214
Frank! Frank!

10:23.915 --> 10:27.169
Frank, they didn't know it was real.
They thought that you were an actor.

10:27.252 --> 10:29.675
Come on, it's not like a million people
haven't seen it already.

10:29.754 --> 10:33.349
It wasn't a million people, Bruce.
It was 18 million people.

10:35.552 --> 10:38.647
Okay, I shouldn't have shown it to Jack
without asking you first.

10:38.763 --> 10:39.764
You think?

10:39.889 --> 10:42.358
And I shouldn't have put it on the Internet.
That was a mistake!

10:42.976 --> 10:44.148
Okay, Frank, I'm sorry!

10:46.813 --> 10:48.030
Did you just say you were sorry?

10:48.106 --> 10:50.200
I shouldn't have put your wedding tape
on the Internet.

10:50.483 --> 10:54.909
I regret it. It was a long time ago.
I've been a shitty brother.

10:55.155 --> 10:59.956
But I'm a different person now. I'm sober.
And I would like us to start again.

11:05.915 --> 11:07.041
All right, fine.

11:08.418 --> 11:11.342
I'm gonna cook you breakfast
before you go tomorrow.

11:11.671 --> 11:12.763
See you tomorrow.

11:15.133 --> 11:16.635
I love you, Frank!

11:19.095 --> 11:21.143
Hey, hey, watch it!

11:24.559 --> 11:27.938
- Why aren't you in a car?
- What?

11:28.021 --> 11:31.992
This is LA. Nobody walks here.

11:32.775 --> 11:36.120
Take a little bit of advice
and learn the lay of the land.

11:36.196 --> 11:38.949
Yeah, well, let me give you some advice.
There's a rehab back there.

11:39.073 --> 11:40.791
Are you trying to say I'm an alcoholic?

11:42.076 --> 11:44.625
Because that is ridiculous.

11:45.038 --> 11:49.043
Alcoholics don't even ride bicycles, buddy.

11:49.167 --> 11:55.345
They drive in a car.
So you are that, you are an alcoholic.

12:03.806 --> 12:05.683
Lady, are you okay?

12:09.854 --> 12:10.855
Hey.

12:14.442 --> 12:15.443
Great.

12:24.494 --> 12:25.495
Lady.

12:26.829 --> 12:27.830
Hey.

12:58.194 --> 12:59.195
Fuck!

12:59.362 --> 13:00.363
Where am I?

13:02.865 --> 13:05.288
- In a parking lot.
- Why am I in a parking lot?

13:05.660 --> 13:06.707
<i>You passed out.</i>

13:09.122 --> 13:10.419
So you stayed with me?

13:12.208 --> 13:13.209
Yeah.

13:14.502 --> 13:16.880
Okay.
Tell me where you live and I'll take you home.

13:19.424 --> 13:22.223
I don't know where I live any more.

13:23.761 --> 13:29.564
I went home today. And my fiancé,
I dressed like this to surprise him.

13:29.642 --> 13:34.773
And then I get home and he was there.
And he was playing tag.

13:35.773 --> 13:36.774
Tag?

13:37.066 --> 13:41.412
Naked tag. With the guy who cleans the pool.

13:41.654 --> 13:44.123
The pool boy, I guess.

13:44.324 --> 13:48.420
And he's like, "Babe, what do you mean,
you haven't heard of naked tag before?"

13:48.536 --> 13:51.756
"You haven't heard of it?" And I'm like, "No!
I haven't heard of it.

13:51.956 --> 13:56.757
"Because it's not even a game, and I'm not
an idiot, so stop saying that it's a game."

13:56.836 --> 14:02.184
He's like, "Babe, I have an erection!
But it's only because I'm super-competitive!"

14:02.258 --> 14:05.262
And I'm like, "Who's competitive in tag?"

14:05.553 --> 14:08.648
"Have you ever even heard of anyone
who's competitive in tag? No!"

14:08.723 --> 14:12.444
"Because it's a game that you play
with your friends. It's a friendly game!"

14:13.269 --> 14:15.067
- Fuck.
- Yeah, it's usually pretty friendly.

14:15.605 --> 14:21.612
He gets me drunk and then he sits me down
and just tells me everything.

14:25.323 --> 14:28.827
I'm sorry. God, I have no idea
why I'm laying all of this on you.

14:28.951 --> 14:31.124
I don't even know you. I'm really sorry.

14:31.412 --> 14:34.461
No. It's okay. Really.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.007
I'm sorry.

14:47.762 --> 14:51.107
I don't know what your plans are,
but do you maybe wanna go somewhere?

14:54.560 --> 14:57.484
Yeah, you know. Let's go somewhere.

14:58.314 --> 15:02.160
Sure. Okay.

15:03.319 --> 15:04.821
Great.

15:06.239 --> 15:07.957
Would you mind putting your seatbelt on?

15:08.032 --> 15:10.501
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter if I live or die.

15:10.910 --> 15:11.911
Okay...

15:21.629 --> 15:25.133
Wait, no, wait, wait.
My parents are asleep in there.

15:25.675 --> 15:27.177
There's a place in the back.

15:54.620 --> 15:56.839
Shit, that's actually my brother's stuff.

16:13.264 --> 16:14.857
I made this when I was a kid.

16:15.183 --> 16:16.230
Cool.

16:18.394 --> 16:19.816
So you don't live here?

16:20.938 --> 16:26.069
No, no. I actually live in Death Valley.

16:26.569 --> 16:28.992
And what do you do in Death Valley?

16:29.197 --> 16:32.576
I've just been kind of camping out
and trying to write this novel, which is...

16:35.953 --> 16:37.421
- Okay.
- Is that all right?

16:37.580 --> 16:39.548
Um... Yeah, sure.

16:41.042 --> 16:42.510
So what do you write about?

16:44.921 --> 16:46.844
Revenge, mostly.

16:48.591 --> 16:49.888
What is your name?

16:51.260 --> 16:53.012
- Frank.
- Frank, I'm Lassie.

16:54.055 --> 16:55.056
- Hi.
- Hi.

16:55.431 --> 17:02.315
So, Frank, I was just wondering
if perhaps you could just want me tonight.

17:02.396 --> 17:05.900
You can do, honestly,
whatever you want to me.

17:06.400 --> 17:08.152
Like, really, pretty much anything.

17:08.277 --> 17:09.950
- Okay, Lassie?
- Huh.

17:11.196 --> 17:13.746
Could we maybe kiss first?

17:15.076 --> 17:16.578
Yeah. Yeah.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.084
Okay...

17:37.598 --> 17:39.441
- What's the matter?
- What? What?

17:39.517 --> 17:42.737
You're not hard. What's wrong?
Am I doing something wrong?

17:42.812 --> 17:44.564
No. We just started.

17:44.814 --> 17:46.441
Right, but, I mean...

17:46.524 --> 17:49.243
- Actually, Lassie, you're kind of squeezing.
- Yeah?

17:49.318 --> 17:52.948
I am? Sorry. Is that better?

17:54.865 --> 17:57.288
- I mean, you're still squeezing.
- Really'? Fuck.

17:57.535 --> 18:01.039
- Okay, how about that?
- That's a little better.

18:01.372 --> 18:02.373
Yeah?

18:03.708 --> 18:07.212
My God, you can eat my bra.
Like, I'm not just saying that. It's edible.

18:07.295 --> 18:09.764
I got it in a sex shop. It's not toxic.

18:09.839 --> 18:10.840
- It's a turn-on.
- Lassie.

18:11.841 --> 18:13.843
I think I'm okay. For now.

18:15.428 --> 18:16.520
Maybe later.

18:16.887 --> 18:19.106
I'll just... I'll keep it on, so, yeah.

18:23.978 --> 18:27.608
But you're gonna, like...
You will eventually get hard tonight.

18:28.357 --> 18:30.826
Right? I'm just asking.

18:31.027 --> 18:32.028
You will... It'll happen?

18:32.194 --> 18:33.992
It's never been a problem before.

18:35.573 --> 18:37.041
I think we'll be fine.

18:39.035 --> 18:40.036
Great.

18:59.722 --> 19:04.899
I'm sorry that I'm crying. It's stupid.
You must feel like enough of a failure.

19:10.816 --> 19:15.492
Which you shouldn't.
Lots of guys can't get erections sometimes.

19:15.863 --> 19:19.413
God damn it! I just don't understand
why I'm taking care of you.

19:19.867 --> 19:23.292
Because, you know what,
this is actually a really fucking horrible

19:23.412 --> 19:25.585
time for this to be happening to me!

19:25.665 --> 19:31.593
I just don't understand it,
I don't understand why nobody will fuck me!

19:37.426 --> 19:39.770
Your parents. Right, I'm sorry. Fuck.

19:41.430 --> 19:42.477
Thank you.

19:48.270 --> 19:49.487
Fucking hell.

19:50.147 --> 19:53.026
I should just go. So, I'll go.

19:55.194 --> 19:57.447
You don't have to go.

19:58.781 --> 20:00.374
Really. You don't have to go.

20:17.633 --> 20:21.137
Okay. I literally never talk about this.

20:25.266 --> 20:27.735
I found out my fiancée
was cheating at our wedding.

20:28.686 --> 20:29.687
Really?

20:31.605 --> 20:34.905
We were only getting married
because she was pregnant.

20:37.361 --> 20:39.034
It turns out it wasn't my kid.

20:40.322 --> 20:41.323
Wow.

20:42.658 --> 20:45.207
- My best man.
- No way.

20:48.205 --> 20:49.422
What'd you do?

20:53.335 --> 20:54.678
I hit her in the face.

20:55.713 --> 20:57.841
What? Sorry.

20:59.175 --> 21:02.304
It wasn't really a hit. It was more like a slap.

21:06.015 --> 21:08.017
And then I pulled her hair a little.

21:10.227 --> 21:15.233
And then I got an upset stomach
and I threw up on her.

21:17.568 --> 21:18.694
It was fucking terrible.

21:19.028 --> 21:24.706
I knew that I knew you from somewhere.
I saw that...

21:24.784 --> 21:29.005
- I saw your wedding video! On the Internet.
- Yeah, well, a lot of people did.

21:29.079 --> 21:30.456
Why did you put that on the Internet?

21:30.539 --> 21:32.541
I didn't. My brother did.

21:33.667 --> 21:36.716
So weird. My friends used
to watch that video all the time.

21:36.879 --> 21:39.428
They thought it was the funniest shit ever.

21:43.469 --> 21:44.721
I never did, though.

21:46.806 --> 21:49.229
I thought that it was just sad.

21:49.308 --> 21:54.189
Like watching someone get their heart
stepped on, right in front of you.

21:54.480 --> 21:55.527
Or something.

21:56.482 --> 21:59.702
Well, you're, like, the only person
who ever saw that.

22:08.536 --> 22:11.210
You still hate her? The girl?

22:13.249 --> 22:14.466
No.

22:17.253 --> 22:18.220
Yeah.

22:18.295 --> 22:20.764
She sounds exactly like Peter.

22:20.840 --> 22:25.937
Just a lying, cheating, whore bitch. My God.

22:27.972 --> 22:29.064
Go on.

22:29.348 --> 22:34.229
No, I just think that that's really selfish
and cruel and evil.

22:34.937 --> 22:36.439
And whore-like.

22:38.357 --> 22:41.201
Okay. One more time. Slow.

22:42.778 --> 22:46.282
Okay, um... Okay.

22:48.284 --> 22:50.252
She was... What was her name?

22:51.495 --> 22:52.496
Sandra.

22:52.621 --> 22:55.340
Sandra is a fucking

22:58.502 --> 22:59.719
horrible

23:01.589 --> 23:03.011
cunt-face

23:04.800 --> 23:05.801
bitch.

23:06.886 --> 23:09.355
And she fucked you up.

23:10.055 --> 23:14.811
She fucked you up
and she sent you to Death Valley to die.

23:24.028 --> 23:26.247
- Holy shit. Holy shit!
- Okay, now stop talking!

23:26.363 --> 23:28.161
- I can't believe it!
- Please just stop talking.

24:01.398 --> 24:03.492
- Morning, Mom.
- Morning, horn dog.

24:04.068 --> 24:05.786
I saw your lady friend leaving.

24:07.905 --> 24:09.157
I'm gonna take a shower.

24:14.662 --> 24:15.914
Hey, bro.

24:16.038 --> 24:18.257
Hey, sorry. I didn't know you had company.

24:18.332 --> 24:20.676
No, that's okay. You remember Claudia, right?
My editor.

24:21.085 --> 24:23.383
We weren't... We're just friends.

24:24.171 --> 24:27.801
I mean, she'll come over and let me
eat her out sometimes, but it's not serious.

24:27.883 --> 24:28.884
Hi, Frank.

24:29.802 --> 24:31.725
Wait. Bro, bro. I wanted to talk to you.

24:34.848 --> 24:37.977
I wanted you to know that
I filmed you and that chick last night.

24:38.310 --> 24:41.655
And lam glad that I did.
When she hit you with her bike...

24:41.730 --> 24:44.984
- it was awesome.
- It was just... Bang! Fucking love happens.

24:45.067 --> 24:46.910
- Italian vibe.
- Let's see what happens next.

24:47.444 --> 24:48.821
Like very early Cassavetes.

24:48.904 --> 24:52.534
But I heard you loud and clear
last night when you talked about

24:52.616 --> 24:55.745
wanting to be in the loop
and all that shit, and here's the deal.

24:55.911 --> 24:58.255
I dropped a copy
of what I filmed off at Jack's.

24:58.580 --> 24:59.923
- Good for you, baby.
- Get it back.

25:00.541 --> 25:02.384
He asked me to be honest,
and now I've just been honest.

25:02.459 --> 25:03.506
- It's pathetic.
- Bruce...

25:03.627 --> 25:06.801
- Shit. Let me handle this.
- What?

25:07.089 --> 25:10.389
Bro, I'm sorry, okay.

25:12.261 --> 25:16.767
I didn't film you two having the sex.
If that's what you're worried about.

25:16.932 --> 25:18.684
I mean, I watched it. But I didn't film it.

25:18.892 --> 25:22.772
Okay. Bruce.
You're going to give me the address.

25:22.938 --> 25:25.191
And I am going to go pick up
whatever it is you gave him.

25:25.607 --> 25:27.780
VVhy're you being like this?
We just had a beautiful moment.

25:28.110 --> 25:30.204
- We had another beautiful moment...
- Give me the fucking address!

25:30.320 --> 25:31.697
Boys, stop fighting!

25:32.156 --> 25:36.787
I finally get my life in order! I finally find
someone in the business who believes in me.

25:36.952 --> 25:40.422
And I ask my baby brother for one little
favour to help me achieve my dream.

25:40.497 --> 25:41.544
And will he help?

25:41.623 --> 25:45.844
How is Jack Knoll seeing a movie
of a drunken woman hitting me with her bike

25:45.961 --> 25:47.963
helping you get your dream, Bruce?

25:48.047 --> 25:49.424
Stop fighting!

25:49.506 --> 25:52.225
Because it's funny, man. It's fucking funny.

25:52.468 --> 25:54.345
Not as funny <i>as</i> the stuff in the clubhouse.

25:56.930 --> 25:57.977
What did you say?

25:58.057 --> 25:59.058
Nothing.

26:00.225 --> 26:02.944
Bro, you just swore to me
that you didn't film me in the clubhouse.

26:03.145 --> 26:07.651
No, I did not. I swore I didn't
film you having sex. And that was true.

26:08.942 --> 26:14.449
But we had sex in the clubhouse! We had
sex almost immediately in the clubhouse.

26:14.531 --> 26:16.499
I mean, that's what we did in the clubhouse.

26:16.700 --> 26:19.249
That depends on how you define sex.

26:19.328 --> 26:24.129
Personally, I think that sex involves
one of the people having an erection.

26:24.208 --> 26:26.085
- Yeah, that's usually the case.
- Will you shut up?

26:26.293 --> 26:29.888
I'm just saying.
It took quite a while for that to occur.

26:30.339 --> 26:34.640
But when you finally, finally did achieve
that erection, and good for you, bro,

26:34.885 --> 26:38.105
but when you did, I cut.
Because, as far <i>as</i> I'm concerned,

26:38.222 --> 26:41.192
sex is a private thing,
a sacred thing between two people.

26:41.350 --> 26:43.478
- Even if it takes a while.
- Bruce, Bruce.

26:43.560 --> 26:47.815
Listen to my rationale.
How many movies have sex in them?

26:48.065 --> 26:49.191
All of them.

26:49.274 --> 26:51.322
How many movies have impotence?

26:51.401 --> 26:52.402
None of them.

26:52.528 --> 26:53.905
Impotence makes us pop.

26:55.906 --> 26:56.998
Am I wrong?

26:58.867 --> 26:59.868
Wow, wow.

27:00.327 --> 27:02.580
You just hate that I'm making
something of my life, don't you?

27:02.663 --> 27:04.461
You just hate the fact that I'm a director now.

27:04.540 --> 27:06.542
No. I don't. You know why?

27:06.625 --> 27:10.721
Because you're not a director.
You're a fucking pervert. And a freak.

27:11.046 --> 27:15.643
Well, listen to this. Action. Cut. Action. Cut.

27:16.718 --> 27:21.224
Fucking action. That is directing, my friend.

27:23.142 --> 27:25.895
Come on, man. Just let him watch it once.

27:26.061 --> 27:29.486
Did it even occur to you there's
another person in your stupid film?

27:29.565 --> 27:31.112
I mean, did you even think about that?

27:32.401 --> 27:33.823
Mr Knoll!

27:36.113 --> 27:39.242
Jack? Jack?

27:43.328 --> 27:45.171
- You just gonna walk in?
- Yes.

27:45.247 --> 27:48.421
Jack? Hello?

27:59.219 --> 28:00.596
Buddy?

28:06.810 --> 28:08.278
Is this his house?

28:08.979 --> 28:10.151
Must be redecorating.

28:10.981 --> 28:12.278
Jackie-boy?

28:17.738 --> 28:18.739
Hey, man.

28:19.198 --> 28:20.871
Hey. Almost done.

28:21.116 --> 28:23.619
What's up? You look amazing.

28:25.037 --> 28:26.539
Where's all your stuff, bro?

28:26.622 --> 28:30.126
Collection agency. Said they're
coming for my treadmill this morning.

28:30.417 --> 28:32.294
Let them try. Let them try!

28:32.461 --> 28:34.805
- He's got a gun. It's a gun. That's a gun.
- He's virile.

28:34.963 --> 28:37.887
- Mr Knoll.
- Call me Jack, son. How's my form?

28:39.718 --> 28:43.222
Pretty good.
So, my brother dropped off a DVD...

28:43.513 --> 28:44.730
DVD. Haven't seen it yet.

28:44.848 --> 28:47.647
I thought you said that you were gonna
watch it before your agent came over.

28:47.809 --> 28:51.063
Agent dropped me as a client.
Said no one'll hire me. Fuck him.

28:51.271 --> 28:54.616
Should've fired him years ago.
Got me up for grampa roles now.

28:54.691 --> 28:58.286
Come here. Look at this. Come here.
Hit my <i>ass.</i>

28:59.071 --> 29:01.244
Frank, hit it. Really hit it. Hit my ass.

29:01.531 --> 29:03.374
- I am not hitting his ass.
- Punch his fucking ass.

29:03.450 --> 29:04.952
Come on! Hit it hard!

29:05.827 --> 29:09.331
Yeah, damn right!
Does that feel like a grampa ass to you?

29:09.414 --> 29:10.415
Not at all.

29:10.499 --> 29:12.877
That ass is harder than a dick on Viagra.

29:13.043 --> 29:16.172
But, no, I got an agent who says,
"Take the grampa roles.

29:16.296 --> 29:17.843
- "They die at the end."
- He's a lunatic.

29:17.923 --> 29:19.338
I don't wanna die. I don't wanna cry.
I wanna fuck!

29:19.341 --> 29:21.014
We gotta get the DVD
and get the fuck out of here.

29:21.093 --> 29:23.721
Bruce, we gotta do movies
where there's lots of fucking!

29:23.845 --> 29:26.348
Don't worry, I can see it in your eyes, I'm fine.

29:27.182 --> 29:29.856
Watch this, motherfuckers!
Where's my addiction, Bruce?

29:29.935 --> 29:32.358
- Way back there, Jack!
- Can you see it, Bruce?

29:32.521 --> 29:36.446
- It's fucking way over there!
- Fuck you, addiction. You cannot catch me!

29:36.608 --> 29:39.657
- I win! I win! I win!
- YOu win!

29:41.989 --> 29:43.707
Come on! Let's watch your movie.

29:44.241 --> 29:45.242
Action!

29:45.575 --> 29:47.043
<i>Hey, hey, watch it!</i>

29:49.997 --> 29:51.544
- Make him turn it off.
- I can't. He's enjoying it.

29:54.001 --> 29:55.378
Frank, you got talent!

29:56.003 --> 29:57.346
I can see it!

29:57.713 --> 29:59.090
Isn't the camera work good?

29:59.631 --> 30:01.258
Frank?

30:05.304 --> 30:07.306
- What are you doing?
- Shit!

30:07.389 --> 30:08.857
What the fuck are you doing?

30:10.225 --> 30:11.727
What the fuck was that?

30:11.977 --> 30:13.524
- You didn't see that spark?
- What?

30:13.603 --> 30:14.775
What are you doing here?

30:14.980 --> 30:16.277
That'll dry right out.

30:16.523 --> 30:17.820
What are you doing here?

30:18.025 --> 30:20.904
Frank? You know my daughter?

30:21.361 --> 30:22.362
She's your daughter?

30:22.446 --> 30:24.619
Dad, could you maybe put some clothes on?
Maybe?

30:24.781 --> 30:26.499
- This is your dad?
- Yeah.

30:27.409 --> 30:28.410
Hi.

30:29.661 --> 30:30.958
How do you know my Lassie?

30:31.371 --> 30:33.373
Rehab, from rehab. Last night.

30:33.457 --> 30:35.585
I was late. I was on my way to see you...

30:35.667 --> 30:37.510
- Yep, exactly. Exactly.
- ...and I ran into him.

30:37.586 --> 30:42.012
- How do you know my father?
- My brother was his roommate.

30:42.132 --> 30:43.850
Hey, in rehab.

30:43.925 --> 30:46.303
- Brother? The brother...
- Yep. Mmm-That one.

30:46.595 --> 30:47.847
- I'm gonna finish my workout.
- Okay.

30:47.929 --> 30:49.681
Then let's all have
a calm breakfast inside.

30:49.765 --> 30:50.937
What a coincidence.

30:51.058 --> 30:52.526
He's an amazing man, your father.

30:52.768 --> 30:56.272
- Jack, don't forget the treadmill's on!
- Shit!

31:05.572 --> 31:06.573
But I fell...

31:07.115 --> 31:08.833
What is wrong with you?

31:08.909 --> 31:10.957
People are
not just wandering around,

31:11.036 --> 31:13.004
waiting for you to make movies
about them, Bruce.

31:13.080 --> 31:16.926
This is a public place, Frankie. If they don't
wanna be filmed, they shouldn't come here.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.468
Where are you going?
Where are you taking me?

31:18.794 --> 31:22.344
- Going home, Dad. We're going home.
- No, take me back in there! You're the doctor!

31:22.422 --> 31:25.392
- OxyContin! Just get me them, damn it!
- He's an orderly. Will you just calm...

31:25.467 --> 31:27.094
- What's wrong?
- He wants drugs.

31:27.177 --> 31:28.224
Jack!

31:28.303 --> 31:29.976
Come here, please. Please, listen to me, man.

31:30.055 --> 31:31.602
Look, lam in deep pain, man.

31:31.681 --> 31:35.311
- The doctor said I needed some painkillers.
- The doctor said Advil was fine.

31:35.477 --> 31:37.946
- He told me OxyContin.
- He did not say...

31:38.063 --> 31:40.407
He did not say OxyContin.
He said OxyContin.

31:40.649 --> 31:41.650
Give me a Darvon.

31:41.817 --> 31:44.616
Okay, Jack, listen to me,
drugs aren't your friend. I am your friend.

31:44.694 --> 31:47.243
And what I'm going to do, <i>as</i> your friend,
I'm gonna take you to a meeting.

31:47.322 --> 31:48.995
Can I have your car keys?
I'm gonna take him to a meeting.

31:51.326 --> 31:53.078
Make sure you get that DVD!

32:01.711 --> 32:03.884
Well, it's nice to see you again.

32:03.964 --> 32:07.343
Yeah, you really don't have to say that to me.

32:07.676 --> 32:08.768
What are you talking about?

32:08.844 --> 32:12.690
I mean, I knew you weren't going to call me,
which is actually totally fine. So...

32:13.432 --> 32:18.484
I already did. Twice. Check your phone.

32:21.440 --> 32:26.196
I don't believe it.
Look, Frank, I don't do what we did last night.

32:26.862 --> 32:31.709
Okay. And I know that lots of girls say that,
but I really never, ever, ever do that stuff.

32:32.033 --> 32:33.285
Okay...

32:33.368 --> 32:36.588
And now it turns out that
you know my father, who I want to kill,

32:36.705 --> 32:41.632
and anytime I get sucked back
into his whole crazy world,

32:41.710 --> 32:43.758
it ends very, very badly. So...

32:48.091 --> 32:50.890
Lassie, I actually don't know your dad.

32:50.969 --> 32:55.566
But I do know what it's like
to want to kill a relative.

32:55.640 --> 32:59.986
Hey, look,
I'm not trying to suck you into anything,

33:01.104 --> 33:06.406
I'd just really love go out on, like,
a regular date with you. You know?

33:07.360 --> 33:11.957
We could see a movie. Maybe get something
to eat that isn't part of your underwear.

33:20.332 --> 33:24.178
Hi, everyone. My name is Jack,
and I'm an alcoholic and a drug addict.

33:24.794 --> 33:26.046
Hi, Jack.

33:26.171 --> 33:32.019
Drugs and alcohol
cost me my career as a movie star.

33:32.427 --> 33:37.183
And I only say that up in case any of you
doubt that this disease can take away

33:37.265 --> 33:39.017
the things that you love most.

33:41.353 --> 33:44.607
That's what happened to me.
Just one more thing.

33:45.023 --> 33:48.323
If any of you ladies wanted to have sex with
me back when I was a somebody

33:48.401 --> 33:51.951
and didn't get a chance, meet me out back.
I also have a pool.

34:02.958 --> 34:04.926
Have you ever worked at a strip club?

34:05.001 --> 34:06.298
- Bruce?
- Yeah.

34:06.378 --> 34:08.972
- Hi. My name's David.
- Hi.

34:09.089 --> 34:10.931
- This is my wife, Natalie.
- Hello.

34:11.049 --> 34:14.474
We related to everything you said
in the meeting.

34:14.594 --> 34:16.516
We wanted to be
in the movie business our whole lives.

34:16.638 --> 34:22.235
And when we got sober, we swore we'd
finally do what we were supposed to do.

34:22.811 --> 34:24.813
That's why we started our company.

34:24.896 --> 34:29.697
- Los Angeles Pictures.
- Los Angeles. "Angels."

34:31.444 --> 34:33.161
Did you know that angels are everywhere?

34:33.487 --> 34:36.661
- I did not know that, David.
- There's one standing next to you.

34:38.076 --> 34:40.498
Don't be afraid. That's Sonya. She follows us.

34:43.415 --> 34:46.134
Did you come with Jack Knoll?
Are you friends?

34:47.252 --> 34:49.175
Jack? Yeah. Big time, good friend.

34:49.337 --> 34:50.884
No, hit it, hit it, hit it.

34:51.047 --> 34:55.518
Do you think that you and Jack would be
interested in making movies with us

34:55.635 --> 34:56.681
about angels?

34:57.220 --> 34:59.473
Thanks to dentistry,
we have plenty of money.

35:01.182 --> 35:03.355
You guys are like Christian tooth fairies.

35:05.353 --> 35:06.445
That's amazing.

35:06.521 --> 35:08.398
We're ready to go.

35:08.481 --> 35:11.781
We're just looking for
like-minded artists to join us.

35:11.943 --> 35:13.365
You know what's weird?

35:13.445 --> 35:18.542
Jack, only yesterday, was talking about
how much he loves angels.

35:19.743 --> 35:20.915
My God.

35:22.078 --> 35:24.297
- It's a miracle.
- It's a miracle.

35:24.372 --> 35:26.966
So, how much money do you guys have?

35:27.876 --> 35:29.549
- We have a lot.
- Shh.

35:31.421 --> 35:32.468
Should we pray?

35:32.547 --> 35:33.890
- Let's!
- Let's pray.

35:49.439 --> 35:52.943
- Whoa. Whoa, whoa, Claudia...
- Shhh.

35:54.235 --> 35:56.329
Be very quiet.

35:59.157 --> 36:00.500
Help! Mom!

36:00.617 --> 36:02.039
Shut the fuck up!

36:02.577 --> 36:04.420
Okay. Okay. Just do it.

36:09.918 --> 36:11.841
- Hey, bro.
- Where you been?

36:11.920 --> 36:13.672
Well, Jack and I went to a meeting.

36:13.755 --> 36:16.554
After which I was approached by
some very serious film producers.

36:16.633 --> 36:18.556
I need my keys. I'm late to meet Lassie.

36:18.635 --> 36:21.605
- Okay. Have a good time.
- You got the DVD, right'?

36:21.680 --> 36:23.682
Weren't you supposed to get the DVD?

36:26.017 --> 36:27.360
How do you know he's not home?

36:27.435 --> 36:30.188
He stayed for another meeting.
So, where are you going to take Lassie?

36:30.271 --> 36:32.774
Just get the DVD out of the player
and stop talking.

36:32.857 --> 36:34.951
Why are you always so mean to me?

36:38.196 --> 36:39.698
- It's fucking gone.
- Shh!

36:39.781 --> 36:41.249
He's sleeping.

36:42.117 --> 36:43.664
Fine.

36:44.953 --> 36:46.000
Where are you going?

36:46.287 --> 36:48.289
I'm going to get it.

36:52.961 --> 36:54.554
What if he has an alarm?

36:54.629 --> 36:57.599
You think he has an alarm?
He has no furniture.

36:57.674 --> 36:59.893
But you think he's gonna pay for an alarm?

36:59.968 --> 37:01.891
Use your head, Frankie.

37:02.262 --> 37:04.264
I'm sorry! I'm not a goddamn criminal.

37:04.347 --> 37:07.851
Yeah, well, it's just <i>as</i> well,
because you'd be a terrible one.

37:08.768 --> 37:10.896
Just, fuck... Bruce, the guy has guns.

37:10.979 --> 37:15.029
I know he has guns! And he will use them
on us if he ever watches that video.

37:15.483 --> 37:16.826
So are you gonna help me get it back?

37:16.901 --> 37:19.450
Or are you gonna stand out here
all night and whine like a little bitch?

37:19.529 --> 37:21.202
I'm a bitch'? I'm a bitch?

37:21.281 --> 37:24.410
Then how come you're the one always
sucking Jack Knoll's balls?

37:24.492 --> 37:26.460
He's my friend!

37:28.913 --> 37:31.291
Holy shit. The pig is in the pool.

37:31.541 --> 37:34.090
The pig is in the pool? Fuck.

37:34.169 --> 37:35.295
He's fine. He's swimming.

37:36.129 --> 37:38.302
What're you talking about? Pigs can't swim!

37:38.923 --> 37:42.427
Jack shouldn't have kept a pig by the pool.
It's irresponsible. It's not our fault.

37:42.510 --> 37:44.137
We are not leaving him in there.

37:44.345 --> 37:45.392
Fine. You go get him.

37:45.472 --> 37:47.395
You get him! I'm going on a date after this.

37:47.474 --> 37:48.817
- I can't swim.
- What?

37:48.892 --> 37:52.396
I can't swim, Frankie. I never have.
I don't like water.

37:52.479 --> 37:53.947
I can't even drink the stuff.

37:54.481 --> 37:55.983
You fuck!

38:06.159 --> 38:08.582
I think he's dead. I think he's dead!

38:08.828 --> 38:10.705
- Heimlich him!
- Heimlich him?

38:10.830 --> 38:13.458
Do it! Heimlich him!

38:13.541 --> 38:15.214
Squeeze his little belly.

38:23.301 --> 38:24.894
Is that a condom?

38:26.095 --> 38:27.392
Yeah, that's definitely a condom.

38:27.931 --> 38:29.604
Get it off.

38:29.808 --> 38:31.560
- Who the fuck is out here?
- Jack, Jack!

38:31.768 --> 38:33.736
It's Bruce. Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

38:34.103 --> 38:36.231
- What are you doing here?
- I was worried about you.

38:36.523 --> 38:37.991
Hey, Dharma D-Cup.

38:38.066 --> 38:41.195
And I thought it would be good
if I could be here when you got home.

38:41.277 --> 38:44.827
And it's a good that we were,
because your pig fell in the pool, man.

38:44.906 --> 38:46.499
- Is he all right?
- He's fine.

38:46.574 --> 38:47.575
We saved him.

38:48.117 --> 38:49.369
Mr Knoll.

38:49.536 --> 38:53.962
Since we're already here, would you like us
to get the DVD player fixed?

38:54.040 --> 38:55.587
That's a good idea, Frankie.

38:55.667 --> 38:57.089
Don't worry about it.

38:57.252 --> 39:00.005
My housekeeper took it home with her.
Her husband fixes them.

39:27.991 --> 39:29.368
Hey, GUYS...

39:29.450 --> 39:32.044
We're looking for Ramon and Celia.

39:32.453 --> 39:33.796
They just left for now, bro.

39:34.998 --> 39:36.375
Right. Um...

39:36.457 --> 39:37.709
Do you know where they went?

39:37.792 --> 39:39.510
None of your business.

39:41.421 --> 39:43.344
You're done now?

39:43.423 --> 39:45.642
What's up, homes? Listen,

39:45.717 --> 39:49.563
Cecilia, the Chiquita who lives here,
she works for a guy called Jack Knoll.

39:49.637 --> 39:54.143
You know Jack Knoll? He's a big TV actor.

39:54.225 --> 39:56.023
You don't have a TV. That's okay.

39:56.102 --> 39:58.696
Jack's a really good amigo of mine.

39:58.771 --> 40:02.071
And he sent me over to just grab
something from...

40:02.150 --> 40:03.322
They just left. If want to come back a little...

40:03.401 --> 40:04.402
Maybe we'll just have a quick look inside.

40:04.485 --> 40:06.487
Maybe I'll just break your fucking legs
if you take another step.

40:07.196 --> 40:08.448
You're gonna do it?

40:10.575 --> 40:12.248
Okay. You're a lot bigger standing up.

40:12.368 --> 40:14.871
- Sorry to disturb you.
- Just get the fuck out of here.

40:14.954 --> 40:16.501
See that.

40:42.023 --> 40:43.946
I can see it. It's just here.

40:44.025 --> 40:45.117
My God.

40:49.030 --> 40:50.373
You have to do it.

40:50.448 --> 40:52.291
- What?
- You have to go in.

40:53.493 --> 40:56.246
I swore on my sobriety that
I wouldn't steal any more, Frank.

40:56.496 --> 40:59.921
And besides, breaking and entering
a stranger's home is definitely a felony

40:59.999 --> 41:01.546
and I've already got two strikes.

41:01.626 --> 41:03.344
If you think
you're going to manipulate me and...

41:03.419 --> 41:04.762
Fine.

41:05.088 --> 41:07.762
I'll go. I'll do it. It's fine.

41:08.591 --> 41:10.343
Bruce, neither of us should do it!

41:10.426 --> 41:13.521
Frank, if I get caught
and go down for 3O years,

41:13.846 --> 41:15.018
will you do me a favour?

41:15.098 --> 41:17.647
Promise you won't put Mom
in a nursing home.

41:20.603 --> 41:22.196
All right. Wait. Wait.

41:31.823 --> 41:33.120
- Stop pushing.
- Okay.

41:40.373 --> 41:41.374
You Okay?

42:33.885 --> 42:34.886
What are you doing?

42:35.470 --> 42:36.642
He's attacking me.

42:36.721 --> 42:37.722
Shake him off!

42:38.181 --> 42:40.058
He's really strong!

42:40.141 --> 42:42.109
Frank, Frank! Stab him!

42:42.185 --> 42:44.108
- What?
- Take this knife and stab him!

42:44.187 --> 42:45.734
I'm not fucking stabbing him, Bruce.

42:45.813 --> 42:47.611
He's, like, a million years old.
It doesn't matter.

42:47.690 --> 42:49.988
Okay, just bring him over here. I'll stab him.

42:51.944 --> 42:53.696
He fucking bit me!

42:54.655 --> 42:55.656
Give me the DVD player!

43:00.620 --> 43:01.621
Good luck.

43:03.081 --> 43:05.129
Bruce! Bruce!

43:05.208 --> 43:06.209
What the fuck?

43:16.010 --> 43:18.763
It really took you 14 hours to get me out?

43:18.846 --> 43:21.440
When Bruce gets arrested,
we always let him spend the night.

43:21.516 --> 43:23.860
Your mother and I
decided we shouldn't play favourites.

43:24.852 --> 43:27.105
Bruce is a fucking criminal!

43:27.188 --> 43:28.610
Ex-criminal.

43:28.689 --> 43:31.033
And you are scarcely
in any position to judge.

43:31.776 --> 43:32.777
Here.

43:42.370 --> 43:43.371
Stop sign!

44:03.141 --> 44:05.644
- Hello.
- I am so sorry about last night.

44:05.726 --> 44:08.024
Don't even worry about it. Bruce called me.

44:08.104 --> 44:09.856
He told me all about your father's scare.

44:09.939 --> 44:11.532
Are they sure that it's not a heart attack?

44:12.525 --> 44:14.072
Yeah, he's...

44:15.570 --> 44:16.742
They said he's fine.

44:16.821 --> 44:17.822
Good.

44:17.989 --> 44:19.366
So...

44:19.782 --> 44:20.999
You want to get together later?

44:22.076 --> 44:23.794
Right, well...

44:24.704 --> 44:27.082
Frank, I just don't think that I have the time.

44:28.749 --> 44:31.093
Right. Okay.

44:31.627 --> 44:33.254
The relief organisation that I work for,

44:33.337 --> 44:36.056
they just offered me this position
in China that I'm thinking about taking.

44:36.132 --> 44:38.760
<i>So, it's just kinda crazy right now.</i>

44:40.136 --> 44:44.357
But if I'm ever in Death Valley, then,
you know, I'll absolutely give you a call.

44:45.349 --> 44:46.726
Okay...

44:48.436 --> 44:50.689
Okay. Have a safe trip.

44:58.946 --> 45:00.163
Fuck.

45:02.950 --> 45:05.248
Hey, bro. I got it.

45:05.328 --> 45:06.671
All broken up.

45:09.290 --> 45:12.009
I also got all the tape. That's for you as well.

45:12.793 --> 45:15.387
And don't worry.
Jack's maid isn't going to press charges.

45:17.506 --> 45:18.723
Are you okay, bro?

45:18.799 --> 45:20.597
Did someone touch you in prison?

45:23.429 --> 45:24.851
Have my car keys?

45:27.850 --> 45:30.399
Look at me and tell me
you don't have any more copies.

45:33.189 --> 45:36.489
I swear, on my sobriety,

45:37.151 --> 45:39.153
that I don't have any more copies.

45:49.247 --> 45:51.170
Now swear that no one else has any.

45:55.002 --> 45:59.098
Okay, since your impotence is
apparently so embarrassing to you,

45:59.173 --> 46:02.473
I had Claudia completely re-edit my movie.

46:02.551 --> 46:05.304
Which means, technically,
I don't even have to show it to you.

46:05.763 --> 46:08.892
Because as you will soon see, this movie
no longer has anything to do with you.

46:09.100 --> 46:12.525
But I'm happy for you to see it
because you're my brother and I love you.

46:13.271 --> 46:14.693
Claudia, play it for him.

46:14.855 --> 46:17.199
Well, what you're about to see,
in my opinion,

46:17.275 --> 46:20.950
is a serious step back
from the integrity of Bruce's original work.

46:21.028 --> 46:22.120
Could you just press play, please?

46:22.196 --> 46:24.790
Okay, will you just stop
yelling at me, please?

46:24.865 --> 46:26.333
- I'm not even yelling at you.
- You're being rude.

46:26.409 --> 46:27.786
Just play it.

46:40.256 --> 46:41.382
- What's wrong?
- What?

46:41.465 --> 46:42.762
<i>- What's wrong?
- What?</i>

46:42.842 --> 46:45.311
<i>You're not hard. What's wrong?
Am I doing something wrong?</i>

46:45.386 --> 46:47.559
<i>No, no, no. We just started.</i>

46:50.057 --> 46:51.479
<i>- Actually, Lassie.
- Yeah?</i>

46:51.559 --> 46:52.731
<i>You're kind of squeezing.</i>

46:52.935 --> 46:56.610
I originally planned to put
fuzz face on the genitals.

46:56.689 --> 46:59.863
But it's actually a lot funnier with genitals.

46:59.942 --> 47:03.162
Especially since you were
having so much trouble with your genitals.

47:03.321 --> 47:04.823
I'm sorry. Who the fuck are you?

47:04.905 --> 47:07.408
This is Arthur. Arthur, this is Frank.

47:07.491 --> 47:10.290
Arthur's a bigwig in the whole
in the whole fuzz face game.

47:10.411 --> 47:12.664
And what exactly did you plan
to do with this?

47:12.747 --> 47:15.296
It's going to be submitted it to a
sex-tape site in the valley.

47:15.416 --> 47:17.965
It's a do-it-yourself fornication
and lighting emporium, called.

47:18.044 --> 47:20.422
ChooseALam pAndGo F uckEachOther. Com.

47:20.629 --> 47:21.755
<i>Please get hard.</i>

47:22.089 --> 47:24.683
<i>Please get hard. Please get hard.
Please get hard.</i>

47:25.593 --> 47:26.970
Shit.

47:27.053 --> 47:29.021
Frank, you ungrateful little bitch.

47:29.096 --> 47:31.064
We did this so you wouldn't have to
be embarrassed!

47:39.940 --> 47:42.534
Hey, idiots.
I uploaded it without the fuzz face.

47:42.610 --> 47:44.863
Now your film is going to be seen
the way it was meant to be seen.

47:47.448 --> 47:48.620
What?

47:49.617 --> 47:51.460
<i>Are you into lesbians?</i>

47:51.535 --> 47:53.082
<i>That's a thing with guys, right?</i>

47:53.329 --> 47:54.956
The girl is Jack Knoll's daughter!

47:55.039 --> 47:56.461
Great art hurts, Bruce.

47:56.957 --> 48:00.882
<i>Mmm... Boobs. I love your boobs.</i>

48:06.300 --> 48:07.927
Do not honk my horn.

48:08.010 --> 48:09.011
Can you go around him?

48:11.305 --> 48:14.104
Look who's suddenly
nervous about someone seeing the movie.

48:14.183 --> 48:16.561
Yes, I'm nervous about being killed!

48:16.644 --> 48:19.238
As soon as he sees that video,
you don't think he's gonna kill you, too?

48:20.022 --> 48:22.116
I am nervous about being actually shot!

48:22.191 --> 48:24.614
Not about the possibility of maybe
somebody on the Internet

48:24.693 --> 48:26.866
seeing my embarrassing weiner.

48:32.326 --> 48:33.953
No. Open hand! Open hand!

49:04.108 --> 49:06.031
- Hey.
- Excuse me.

49:08.028 --> 49:10.076
Kip, Kip, it's him, it's him.

49:11.866 --> 49:13.243
Your video was dope, dawg.

49:13.325 --> 49:14.542
I'm the director.

49:15.077 --> 49:17.455
The most original sex tape ever.

49:17.538 --> 49:18.710
Shut your mouth.

49:19.123 --> 49:20.124
We'd like it back.

49:20.207 --> 49:24.257
I mean, a sex tape with no sex.
That is just genius.

49:24.336 --> 49:27.715
Yeah, it was great. The thing is,
it was actually sent to you by mistake.

49:27.798 --> 49:30.017
So, we're really gonna need you to destroy it.

49:30.092 --> 49:32.595
I can't do that.
Once it goes up, it's up for 72 hours.

49:32.720 --> 49:35.064
Wait, wait, wait.
You're saying it's on the Internet now?

49:35.264 --> 49:37.517
Come, check it out.
You got some great feedback, dawg.

49:37.850 --> 49:38.817
Come on, man. Take a look here.

49:38.893 --> 49:42.397
Dad! Cut it with the welding, man. Come on!

49:42.605 --> 49:44.733
- Are these all for me?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. See?

49:44.815 --> 49:47.193
Here's the deal,
either take it down right now, or...

49:47.276 --> 49:49.244
- ls five boners good?
- Five boners is great.

49:49.403 --> 49:51.656
- That's five out of five.
- Five out of five boners.

49:51.739 --> 49:52.956
And they're really stingy with boners.

49:53.032 --> 49:56.332
Yeah, they don't give boners for anybody.
Dad! We have customers!

49:56.410 --> 49:58.663
- Hey, pal, pal, you wanna negotiate?
- No, I don't.

49:58.746 --> 50:00.714
They call me Alfred Bitchcock.

50:01.457 --> 50:04.006
That's hilarious.
I don't know what that means, though.

50:04.084 --> 50:05.802
- You want a car?
- I don't want a car.

50:05.878 --> 50:07.175
I got a '93 Honda right outside.

50:07.254 --> 50:09.097
I have a DUI and I drive a Vespa.

50:09.215 --> 50:11.343
"Kinky In Kualalumpa" thinks that
I'm a visionary.

50:11.425 --> 50:14.804
If other men are on our site
and they see a guy like you

50:14.887 --> 50:18.937
having trouble getting an erection,
keeping an erection, forming an erection...

50:19.016 --> 50:20.017
Right.

50:20.100 --> 50:22.102
I think that they'll feel a lot
better about themselves.

50:22.228 --> 50:23.855
I don't want to be too forward,

50:23.938 --> 50:26.032
but would you like to maybe get some
coffee or something later?

50:26.106 --> 50:27.483
- Anytime.
- That'd be great.

50:27.566 --> 50:29.910
Like, wait, did you mean romantically?

50:29.985 --> 50:31.953
Most certainly romantically.

50:32.071 --> 50:33.869
- Bruce, can we leave, please?
- Sure.

50:34.490 --> 50:35.833
All right. Hey, send us more stuff.

50:35.908 --> 50:38.252
Seriously, guys, you cannot fucking
mess with people's lives like this.

50:38.327 --> 50:39.670
I really appreciate your support.

50:39.745 --> 50:42.294
You will take this down, or you
will face the fucking consequences.

50:42.373 --> 50:43.966
I will call you, okay? About this.

50:44.792 --> 50:46.214
Did you think I didn'tjust see that?

50:46.293 --> 50:50.298
You heard the guy. They've only got, like,
15,000 subscribers tops.

50:50.381 --> 50:53.635
Mostly in Asia.
And he's going to take it down in 72 hours.

50:53.717 --> 50:55.811
I am not waiting 72 hours.

50:56.470 --> 50:58.973
Why are you so embarrassed about
your impotency'?

50:59.390 --> 51:01.984
I don't have impotency!

51:03.352 --> 51:05.571
I had a brief one-time-only episode.

51:05.646 --> 51:09.150
It happens to everyone.
I was impotent last night.

51:09.817 --> 51:12.616
I know. I was.
I mean, I had just watched your video.

51:12.695 --> 51:16.575
So, it was probably just some kind of
fraternal sympathy softie. But even so...

51:16.657 --> 51:19.251
Claudia had to put three fingers
up my ass last night to get me hard.

51:19.326 --> 51:21.829
I understand your pain. Family.

51:21.912 --> 51:25.633
Hey. David! No this is a good time.
I've just come from church.

51:36.010 --> 51:37.262
Do you want me to hum?

51:37.344 --> 51:38.937
<i>It's just my jaw hurts.</i>

51:39.013 --> 51:40.515
Mother of God...

51:40.889 --> 51:41.936
Okay, Dad! That's enough.

51:42.016 --> 51:44.769
Well, that was excruciating.

51:44.852 --> 51:46.274
Just tell me you can get it down.

51:46.353 --> 51:48.401
This is out of our area of expertise.

51:48.480 --> 51:50.653
Although Sydney did just e-mail me

51:50.733 --> 51:53.282
that it is illegal to film someone
in an unflattering manner

51:53.360 --> 51:54.452
without their knowledge.

51:54.528 --> 51:56.872
And that was definitely unflattering.

51:56.947 --> 51:57.948
- Dad!
- What?

51:58.032 --> 51:59.249
Sydney, he's my partner.

51:59.325 --> 52:01.578
How am I supposed to help you
if I don't know what's going on'?

52:02.202 --> 52:03.875
Listen, I think you should call Judge Collins,

52:03.954 --> 52:06.377
have him issue a take-down order.

52:06.457 --> 52:07.879
Here's his number. Thank you, dear.

52:10.377 --> 52:12.926
You gotta be kidding me!
You showed the intern?

52:13.005 --> 52:15.007
Everything here is confidential!

52:21.513 --> 52:23.231
- They're dentists?
- That's right.

52:23.307 --> 52:26.811
And they are super rich, Morn, and
they wanna make a movie with Jack and I.

52:26.894 --> 52:28.942
- That's fantastic.
- I know.

52:29.021 --> 52:30.694
I'd love to have you involved in some way.

52:30.773 --> 52:32.571
- Me?
- Of course.

52:32.650 --> 52:35.403
It's been too long since you and I
have created art together.

52:35.486 --> 52:37.284
When did you two ever make art together?

52:37.404 --> 52:39.156
My painting.

52:39.239 --> 52:41.037
Don't you remember I sat for that?

52:41.492 --> 52:42.493
Yes.

52:42.701 --> 52:46.797
Great things are happening.
Sobriety has worked wonders with your life.

52:46.872 --> 52:48.840
Excuse me, am I invisible?

52:48.916 --> 52:52.136
Your beautiful sober son just put me in
a porn video without my permission.

52:52.252 --> 52:54.505
Stop it. There is nothing in that video

52:54.588 --> 52:57.091
that earns it the title of porn and you know it.

52:57.800 --> 52:59.222
You watched it?

52:59.301 --> 53:01.178
- You showed it to Mom?
- You showed it to Dad.

53:01.261 --> 53:02.934
To help get it down.

53:03.013 --> 53:04.356
Mom, why would you watch that?

53:04.431 --> 53:07.856
I watch all of Bruce's films.
Besides, there is nothing wrong

53:07.935 --> 53:10.279
with a mother seeing her son's
penis in repose.

53:10.354 --> 53:13.449
Had you gotten aroused,
I would've stopped watching.

53:13.524 --> 53:15.526
Can we stop talking about this?

53:15.609 --> 53:20.115
I am seeing ajudge tomorrow
and all of this is going to be behind us.

53:20.197 --> 53:21.540
Stop being such a drama queen.

53:21.615 --> 53:24.038
Mom, I'm on a website
where people fuck fruit.

53:24.118 --> 53:26.337
It is not people. It is one man.
And it's very funny.

53:26.412 --> 53:28.130
And don't talk with your mouth full.

53:28.205 --> 53:30.674
My God. Please be poison.

53:30.749 --> 53:32.217
When did he become such a prude?

53:32.292 --> 53:35.171
You know, I hate to say it,
but I think I agree with her on this one.

53:35.254 --> 53:37.803
What was the point of your mother
and I having sex with the door open

53:37.881 --> 53:40.384
if we were raising a puritan?

53:40.467 --> 53:42.060
- Dad.
- Thank you, my darling.

53:45.139 --> 53:46.231
May I be excused?

53:46.306 --> 53:48.479
Look who's finally being polite.

53:48.976 --> 53:51.980
You know, some nights I really miss
the sound of you guys making love.

53:52.271 --> 53:53.648
Yeah. Me, too.

53:54.523 --> 53:56.525
I'm so sorry. I didn't know who else to call.

53:56.942 --> 53:58.660
What is going on?

53:58.777 --> 54:02.031
I swear to God, if you fire one more shot,
I'll fucking kill you.

54:02.114 --> 54:03.991
My fiancé!

54:04.575 --> 54:08.580
My fiancé called him and told him everything.
I have no idea what he was thinking.

54:08.662 --> 54:11.757
So, of course, my dad just
totally flips out and he goes to grab his gun.

54:11.832 --> 54:13.584
So I just locked him in there, in the shed.

54:13.709 --> 54:17.213
And is this his normal reaction
to a situation like this?

54:17.504 --> 54:21.134
He's freakishly protective of me,
in his own weird way.

54:21.216 --> 54:25.016
- Jack! Hey, buddy, it's Bruce.
- Stay out of this.

54:25.429 --> 54:29.559
I'm gonna open the door,
but you have to give me your gun.

54:29.641 --> 54:30.938
- No.
- The thing is, Jack,

54:31.018 --> 54:33.897
it's really not cool to shoot people any more.

54:34.730 --> 54:37.734
It's illegal.
Besides, I've got really good news.

54:37.816 --> 54:39.363
What news?

54:39.693 --> 54:42.037
I am opening the door.

54:45.532 --> 54:46.954
Gimme the gun.

54:47.743 --> 54:49.586
- What's the news?
- I got us producers.

54:49.661 --> 54:50.913
- Really?
- Yeah!

54:50.996 --> 54:52.919
You know, why don't you just take drugs?
Just take drugs again.

54:53.874 --> 54:56.468
- Why would you say that?
- Because you are just <i>as</i> bad...

54:56.543 --> 54:58.261
You're worse, actually, when you're sober.

54:58.337 --> 55:02.308
So, please, I am begging you
to take drugs, Jack.

55:02.382 --> 55:07.809
First of all, I don't think
you should be calling me "Jack."

55:07.888 --> 55:10.266
I think you should call me "Dad."

55:15.437 --> 55:16.939
Hey.

55:17.606 --> 55:19.028
Hi.

55:21.193 --> 55:23.287
You Okay?

55:32.079 --> 55:33.171
Are you sure you're okay?

55:45.300 --> 55:47.644
Sorry, if I'm giving you mixed messages.

55:49.221 --> 55:54.978
I don't really think that it takes a genius
to figure out why I'm a little bit confused.

55:57.980 --> 56:00.324
I think we're all a little bit confused.

56:00.941 --> 56:03.364
Thanks for being a good guy.

56:03.777 --> 56:04.824
I'm really not.

56:04.903 --> 56:07.076
No. You really are.

56:10.325 --> 56:12.669
What do you mean, the judge thinks
we should leave it up'?

56:12.744 --> 56:16.465
Well, apparently, these gossip websites bribe
clerks to alert them

56:16.540 --> 56:19.589
when people get down sex tapes,
in case there's a celebrity involved.

56:19.668 --> 56:22.547
Anyway, Lassie's a celebrity's
kid, and there's only 48 hours left,

56:22.629 --> 56:25.724
so the judge thinks
it's just not worth the risk.

56:25.799 --> 56:28.302
Okay, you know what? Fuck it.

56:28.385 --> 56:29.728
Can I borrow one of Dad's ties?

56:29.803 --> 56:31.805
I got my meeting with the producers
and I want to look fancy.

56:31.972 --> 56:33.064
Aw, of course you can.

56:33.140 --> 56:34.892
- Where are you going?
- I'm doing what I should've done

56:34.975 --> 56:37.228
from the very beginning. I'm telling Lassie.

56:37.311 --> 56:39.439
- Why?
- The judge can't get down the sex tape.

56:39.813 --> 56:41.281
What? No! Wait, wait, wait.

56:41.356 --> 56:42.403
I'm not asking your permission.

56:42.482 --> 56:44.155
No. I told you, man. She's never gonna see it.

56:44.276 --> 56:46.950
I'm telling Lassie and I'm going home.

56:48.447 --> 56:50.666
Can you believe that pussy came from
your pussy?

56:51.116 --> 56:53.369
What about Phil? Maybe he can help.

56:53.452 --> 56:55.500
- FATHERI Who's Phil?
- Phil.

56:56.622 --> 56:58.340
I love you, Mom.

56:59.833 --> 57:01.631
His cell mate from prison.

57:01.710 --> 57:03.337
The guy who eats rats?

57:03.420 --> 57:04.763
Don't be so negative!

57:04.838 --> 57:06.761
He hacked into a bank and got $20 million.

57:06.840 --> 57:08.763
He's not just some guy that eats rats.

57:08.842 --> 57:11.766
Hey, Phil! It's Bruce. Long time, man.

57:11.845 --> 57:14.143
I'm actually just calling
because I need a favour.

57:14.222 --> 57:16.725
He's talking to his friend, the ex-con.
He eats rats.

57:16.808 --> 57:18.526
Don't tell Mother I told you.

57:18.644 --> 57:20.487
Yeah, so is it okay if I send over my brother?

57:20.771 --> 57:22.398
What? I'm not going!

57:22.481 --> 57:25.030
He's a computer whiz!
He can get the sex tape off the Internet.

57:25.108 --> 57:27.202
He's a rodent-eating ex-convict I don't know.

57:27.277 --> 57:28.403
Hey, we're both coming.

57:33.742 --> 57:35.961
Hello?

57:40.540 --> 57:42.918
Hello? Phil?

57:44.252 --> 57:45.629
Hi.

57:47.756 --> 57:48.882
Is Phil here?

57:53.136 --> 57:54.729
Hello, Bruce.

57:55.347 --> 57:56.394
Phil?

57:59.184 --> 58:00.561
It's Phyllis now.

58:01.061 --> 58:03.814
My God. That's weird.

58:05.399 --> 58:08.778
I'd like to introduce you to Frankie.

58:08.860 --> 58:11.079
The brother.

58:11.154 --> 58:12.406
Charmed.

58:14.324 --> 58:16.326
Kiss the hand.

58:24.251 --> 58:26.219
Come in, boys.

58:38.181 --> 58:40.855
No. I'm clean as a whistle.

58:40.934 --> 58:42.777
I'm impressed.

58:53.196 --> 58:54.413
No thanks.

58:55.657 --> 58:58.877
It's not nice to make a lady party alone.

58:58.952 --> 59:01.751
Especially when she's doing you a favour.

59:03.040 --> 59:04.041
Right.

59:04.833 --> 59:08.804
So, Phil, do you think, maybe, we
could get this movie down off the Internet?

59:08.879 --> 59:11.007
- It's Phyllis.
- Yes, it is.

59:11.965 --> 59:16.345
I get so horny when I smoke pot. You, too?

59:21.224 --> 59:24.478
You know, I hope you don't take this
the wrong way,

59:24.811 --> 59:27.109
but I found your film very healing.

59:28.982 --> 59:31.280
I've had a lot of sadness lately.

59:31.359 --> 59:33.737
A lot of new girls do.

59:33.820 --> 59:38.951
Grieving the lost phallus, it's normal.

59:39.159 --> 59:40.411
It's so normal.

59:40.494 --> 59:42.496
But I have to tell you.

59:43.497 --> 59:48.628
When I saw what happened to you last night,
Good Lord, I didn't miss my cock one bit.

59:48.752 --> 59:51.596
Would you like to see it?

59:51.922 --> 59:53.640
My phallus.

59:54.674 --> 59:57.473
No, I asked if I could keep it. I keep it in ajar.

59:58.345 --> 59:59.813
Well, I mean, not all of it.

59:59.888 --> 01:00:02.983
I mean, some of it they had to use
to reconstruct my vagina.

01:00:03.058 --> 01:00:05.436
It's an amazingly interesting procedure...

01:00:05.519 --> 01:00:09.194
You don't have to
go into all of that for us, Phyllis.

01:00:11.650 --> 01:00:15.575
You be nice to your Auntie Phyllis,
you little shit.

01:00:15.695 --> 01:00:20.747
No, no. Frankie didn't... Frankie would love
to hear all about your penis operation.

01:00:20.867 --> 01:00:23.996
It's just, we're kind of in a hurry
to get the video down.

01:00:26.039 --> 01:00:28.167
Why has no one asked to see them?

01:00:28.250 --> 01:00:29.797
Your tits?

01:00:30.043 --> 01:00:31.511
I'd fucking love to see your tits.

01:00:33.922 --> 01:00:35.890
And how 'bout you, Frankie?

01:00:37.259 --> 01:00:39.102
Fancy a peek?

01:00:45.392 --> 01:00:47.611
I will not help
people who don't support me.

01:00:47.686 --> 01:00:48.812
What is your problem?

01:00:48.895 --> 01:00:50.613
- What did I do?
- You hesitated!

01:00:50.814 --> 01:00:54.193
When someone offers to show you their tits,
you don't hesitate, you look!

01:00:54.359 --> 01:00:57.329
Bruce, I don't even know this guy.
Why should I look at his tits?

01:00:57.404 --> 01:00:59.998
Her! Motherfucker!

01:01:00.073 --> 01:01:01.950
I'm done helping you.

01:01:02.033 --> 01:01:03.339
- Bruce!
- I'm not gonna be late for my meeting

01:01:03.410 --> 01:01:05.504
to watch you abuse my lady friends, Frank.

01:01:05.954 --> 01:01:07.046
Bruce, I'm sorry!

01:01:07.164 --> 01:01:08.381
Don't say it to me!

01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:21.974
Phyllis. It's me again.

01:01:41.489 --> 01:01:44.117
You're a very good dancer, Frank.

01:01:54.711 --> 01:01:59.717
Phyllis, I would really like to,

01:01:59.799 --> 01:02:04.270
but I'm actually seeing someone right now,
and I'm kind of old-fashioned that way.

01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:09.393
Please don't be mad.

01:02:09.643 --> 01:02:12.146
She's a very lucky girl.

01:02:12.229 --> 01:02:15.574
So, do you think you could

01:02:17.150 --> 01:02:20.575
maybe help with the sex tape?

01:02:22.864 --> 01:02:24.662
Well,

01:02:26.326 --> 01:02:28.624
since you couldn't get it up,

01:02:28.995 --> 01:02:31.248
I may as well get it down.

01:02:36.461 --> 01:02:38.463
Let's see what we have here.

01:02:39.422 --> 01:02:41.516
I really appreciate it, Phyllis.

01:02:43.385 --> 01:02:44.807
You know,

01:02:46.513 --> 01:02:48.186
there is something you could help me with.

01:02:48.265 --> 01:02:49.687
Anything.

01:02:49.766 --> 01:02:54.522
I have this date tonight.
And I really, really like this lady.

01:02:54.604 --> 01:02:58.029
I think I might be a lesbian.
You don't have any problem with that, right?

01:02:58.191 --> 01:02:59.158
No.

01:02:59.234 --> 01:03:04.536
Well, I got waxed for the very first time,
you know, down there.

01:03:07.409 --> 01:03:09.503
At the end of the day,
I went with the Brazilian.

01:03:09.577 --> 01:03:12.501
And, God, I hope I didn't make a mistake.

01:03:12.580 --> 01:03:14.253
I just want everything to be pretty.

01:03:19.379 --> 01:03:22.679
Would you like...
Would you like me to take a look?

01:03:25.885 --> 01:03:26.886
Would you?

01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:29.063
Y9K)...

01:03:29.139 --> 01:03:30.436
Okay...

01:03:41.818 --> 01:03:45.698
Lord, again we thank you so much

01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:48.374
for Jack and for Bruce.

01:03:48.450 --> 01:03:51.750
In your name we pray. Amen.

01:03:51.828 --> 01:03:52.875
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:03:52.954 --> 01:03:54.581
Amen. Hallelujah.

01:03:54.664 --> 01:03:56.712
Good, good.

01:03:56.791 --> 01:03:58.384
Thank you, thank you.

01:03:59.085 --> 01:04:03.807
And we also wanted to talk
to the two of you about...

01:04:06.009 --> 01:04:08.103
Sex.

01:04:10.096 --> 01:04:11.097
Huh?

01:04:11.348 --> 01:04:14.978
Well, you see, my wife and I, we're celibates.

01:04:15.352 --> 01:04:16.524
Shut up.

01:04:16.603 --> 01:04:19.356
We've taken a lifelong vow of chastity.

01:04:19.439 --> 01:04:20.440
My God.

01:04:20.523 --> 01:04:24.027
We don't expect you to
live a similar lifestyle.

01:04:24.110 --> 01:04:26.329
- Dear, no. We never would.
- No.

01:04:26.404 --> 01:04:31.786
But we do feel very strongly
about our films being "sex-free."

01:04:33.953 --> 01:04:36.251
"Sexfree." Yes.

01:04:36.331 --> 01:04:38.129
You want a film with no sex in it.

01:04:38.208 --> 01:04:40.051
- Correct.
- Yes.

01:04:40.126 --> 01:04:44.302
- Lots of angels. Zero sex.
- Is that going to be a problem?

01:04:46.174 --> 01:04:48.176
- Maybe.
- No.

01:05:04.109 --> 01:05:05.110
Phyllis!

01:05:07.821 --> 01:05:09.789
I love you, Phyllis.

01:05:17.372 --> 01:05:22.128
Look at us. We're on regular date,
like regular people. It's nice.

01:05:22.210 --> 01:05:24.258
It's a miracle.

01:05:24.337 --> 01:05:27.307
When do I get to read your book?
Because I kind of want to.

01:05:27.382 --> 01:05:30.886
I think probably never.
I'm pretty sure it sucks.

01:05:31.511 --> 01:05:35.357
I'm pretty sure it sucks, too.
But I still want to read it.

01:05:36.182 --> 01:05:38.560
I won't judge you.

01:05:38.643 --> 01:05:39.860
Maybe the next one.

01:05:41.604 --> 01:05:45.108
Excuse me? It's you. Love the video, dude.

01:05:45.191 --> 01:05:46.488
Fuckin' hysterical.

01:05:46.568 --> 01:05:47.865
It's all right. This happens all the time.

01:05:47.944 --> 01:05:50.697
Seriously.
It's the funniest thing I've ever seen in my life.

01:05:51.281 --> 01:05:53.454
You know it got, like, a million hits
in three hours today?

01:05:53.533 --> 01:05:56.628
Awesome. Fuck off. You know? Thanks.

01:05:56.703 --> 01:05:59.957
My God, I don't know how you
handle that shit.

01:06:00.039 --> 01:06:01.336
Eat my bra!

01:06:02.876 --> 01:06:04.173
Eat my bra!

01:06:04.752 --> 01:06:05.753
What did he say?

01:06:05.837 --> 01:06:07.965
I don't know.
I don't think he was talking to us.

01:06:14.888 --> 01:06:15.935
What?

01:06:26.649 --> 01:06:29.823
<i>We could act out
your masturbation fantasies.</i>

01:06:29.903 --> 01:06:31.576
<i>Maybe that would get you hard.</i>

01:06:32.071 --> 01:06:36.076
Someone must've pirated a copy off
the original site before I shut it down.

01:06:36.576 --> 01:06:41.423
<i>Like, I'll be a cheerleader
and you be the captain of the football team.</i>

01:06:41.831 --> 01:06:44.129
<i>Maybe you just need
some kind of encouragement.</i>

01:06:44.209 --> 01:06:47.713
<i>I'll cheer you on, I'll cheer you on,
I'll cheer you on.</i>

01:06:57.305 --> 01:07:01.276
Please get it down, Phyllis.
I'll do whatever you want.

01:07:01.351 --> 01:07:04.150
We can dance. I'll look at your penis.

01:07:04.229 --> 01:07:05.947
- Frank!
- Go get the jar. Does it open?

01:07:06.022 --> 01:07:09.526
- I'll touch it.
- Frank, Frank, Frank. I know how you feel.

01:07:10.276 --> 01:07:15.282
You're embarrassed and you're ashamed

01:07:15.365 --> 01:07:17.367
and you want to die.

01:07:17.450 --> 01:07:20.704
It's the exact same way I felt
when the guys on my high school team

01:07:20.787 --> 01:07:24.508
walked into the locker room
and I was dressed in a cheerleader's uniform.

01:07:24.582 --> 01:07:28.177
But it was at that moment,
I got a glimpse, for the first time,

01:07:28.253 --> 01:07:30.051
of my true me.

01:07:31.422 --> 01:07:34.517
And that is what I want for you, darling.

01:07:36.761 --> 01:07:41.858
Let your humiliation set you free.

01:07:43.935 --> 01:07:46.404
Come here, sad screw up. Come here.

01:07:48.273 --> 01:07:50.947
That's a very nice shampoo you're wearing.

01:07:51.526 --> 01:07:53.278
Now he'll never work with me.

01:07:53.361 --> 01:07:56.706
Jack? Don't be silly. He adores you.

01:07:56.864 --> 01:07:59.333
Mom, he tried to shoot a guy
who cheated on his daughter.

01:07:59.492 --> 01:08:00.960
I put her in a sex tape,

01:08:01.035 --> 01:08:05.085
which has now been viewed by
by eight million people since breakfast.

01:08:05.164 --> 01:08:08.668
It's not a real sex tape.
It's just a funny little movie.

01:08:11.629 --> 01:08:12.926
- That's it.
- What?

01:08:13.006 --> 01:08:17.055
It's a movie. I'll just tell Jack
that what I shot in the clubhouse

01:08:17.135 --> 01:08:20.014
was a teaser for a larger film.

01:08:20.470 --> 01:08:21.768
What's the film?

01:08:21.848 --> 01:08:23.350
I'll work that out! It writes itself!

01:08:29.439 --> 01:08:31.112
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:08:31.189 --> 01:08:33.113
I'm so glad that you called.

01:08:33.192 --> 01:08:37.447
My dad is at a meeting,
but I ordered us some dinner.

01:08:37.529 --> 01:08:40.283
So, I hope you're hungry.

01:08:45.830 --> 01:08:48.252
Here. Sit.

01:08:48.332 --> 01:08:50.335
I actually have something to tell you.

01:08:51.669 --> 01:08:55.139
It's kind of the reason why we're
eating Chinese food.

01:08:55.214 --> 01:08:56.557
You're going to China?

01:08:59.301 --> 01:09:01.145
The opposite. I told them no.

01:09:02.055 --> 01:09:04.899
It's just kind of the worst time for me to go.

01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:09.904
It might have a tiny little bit to do with you.

01:09:17.278 --> 01:09:19.451
You all right?

01:09:21.866 --> 01:09:23.118
You do these?

01:09:23.201 --> 01:09:25.545
I was really into knights when I was a kid.

01:09:26.746 --> 01:09:29.090
"A strong kind man, dipped in metal."

01:09:29.165 --> 01:09:33.341
Listen. It's actually a very normal fantasy
for a girl whose father

01:09:33.419 --> 01:09:36.343
has never been in a relationship ever.

01:09:36.546 --> 01:09:42.429
You can connect the dots and see
why perhaps I was in need of some chivalry.

01:09:48.725 --> 01:09:51.229
So, what did you want to tell me?

01:09:55.525 --> 01:09:56.651
I'll tell you later.

01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:26.681
Hey.

01:10:26.764 --> 01:10:31.144
Thank you for the date yesterday.
It was really, really nice and normal.

01:10:32.770 --> 01:10:34.738
Listen, Lassie.
Can I talk to you about something?

01:10:34.814 --> 01:10:36.566
I'm actuallyjust running into
a meeting right now.

01:10:36.649 --> 01:10:37.821
Can I give you a call back in a little bit?

01:10:38.359 --> 01:10:41.238
<i>And your brother,
he stopped by and he took your car.</i>

01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:43.914
He said he needed to trade it
for a crane or something, I don't know.

01:10:43.990 --> 01:10:45.992
He said you'd understand.

01:11:02.091 --> 01:11:03.843
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

01:11:09.015 --> 01:11:10.187
<i>- What's going on?
- This is actually</i>

01:11:10.266 --> 01:11:13.645
<i>a really fucking horrible time for this
to be happening to me!</i>

01:11:13.728 --> 01:11:19.201
<i>I just don't understand it,
I don't understand why nobody will fuck me!</i>

01:11:42.298 --> 01:11:45.347
But everyone else has sex, why can't we?

01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:46.761
"Why can't I?"

01:11:47.512 --> 01:11:50.140
Everyone else has sex. Why can't I?

01:11:50.223 --> 01:11:51.520
Behold.

01:11:51.599 --> 01:11:57.106
I am an angel, sent by God, to make you pure.

01:11:57.563 --> 01:11:59.736
Dad! I'm gonna need more wings.

01:11:59.816 --> 01:12:01.159
- What'?
- More wings.

01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:03.782
- Bruce.
- Cut, cut.

01:12:05.071 --> 01:12:06.823
Isn't this fucking amazing?

01:12:07.949 --> 01:12:10.452
- What is this?
- I'm making a movie of that night.

01:12:11.035 --> 01:12:12.787
- What night?
- The night in the clubhouse, bro.

01:12:14.914 --> 01:12:17.963
Okay. Everybody, places. We're going again.

01:12:20.586 --> 01:12:22.714
No. Actually not places.

01:12:22.797 --> 01:12:26.597
Could everyone just pack this stuff up
and go home? I'm sorry.

01:12:26.676 --> 01:12:28.144
Frankie, stop being such a girl.

01:12:28.219 --> 01:12:30.017
Do not disrespect me in front of my crew.

01:12:30.096 --> 01:12:32.599
Okay'? I will slap you down.
I will fucking slap you down.

01:12:32.682 --> 01:12:34.776
All I'm doing here is trying to make
everyone else happy.

01:12:34.851 --> 01:12:36.148
The producers want an angel,

01:12:36.227 --> 01:12:37.729
Jack won't do the movie
unless Dharma's in it.

01:12:37.812 --> 01:12:39.234
Jack is in the movie?

01:12:39.313 --> 01:12:41.441
Of course Jack's in the movie.
Jack's the money!

01:12:41.983 --> 01:12:44.486
But he won't do it unless Dharma's in it,
who can't fucking act.

01:12:44.777 --> 01:12:45.869
Stop fighting, both of you!

01:12:45.945 --> 01:12:47.868
And I am doing all of this, bro,

01:12:47.947 --> 01:12:51.326
just to make sure that you and Cassie
don't get embarrassed.

01:12:51.409 --> 01:12:52.535
- Bruce?
- What?

01:12:52.618 --> 01:12:54.086
Isn't Jack supposed to be in this scene?

01:12:54.579 --> 01:12:57.332
Can everybody just stop talking to me?
Please?

01:12:57.623 --> 01:12:59.421
Okay. We're going again.

01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:01.628
Last time. Rolling sound.

01:13:01.836 --> 01:13:03.133
- Bruce!
- Action.

01:13:05.047 --> 01:13:07.391
Don't listen to the angel.

01:13:07.466 --> 01:13:09.719
Have sex. Have sex now.

01:13:09.802 --> 01:13:11.975
- Angrier!
- Have it all the time!

01:13:15.933 --> 01:13:17.310
Fuck.

01:13:19.770 --> 01:13:21.272
What are you doing here?

01:13:21.355 --> 01:13:23.357
Tell me that you didn't know that
he filmed us that night!

01:13:24.233 --> 01:13:26.452
I didn't. I swear to GOd, I didn't.

01:13:26.527 --> 01:13:28.074
Well, did you know that it was
on the Internet?

01:13:28.154 --> 01:13:30.156
Cut! Places! We're going again.

01:13:31.490 --> 01:13:32.491
My God.

01:13:32.825 --> 01:13:33.826
Action.

01:13:35.411 --> 01:13:38.506
Why won't anyone have sex with me? Wait...

01:13:38.956 --> 01:13:40.879
Is that an angel?

01:13:41.083 --> 01:13:44.883
I forbid the blood to enter your cock.

01:13:44.962 --> 01:13:47.385
Rise, penis, rise!

01:13:47.465 --> 01:13:49.593
Bruce, could you have her say
"phallus" instead?

01:13:49.675 --> 01:13:50.767
What is all of this?

01:13:50.843 --> 01:13:52.937
Fill with blood! Fill that member!

01:13:53.012 --> 01:13:57.233
Bruce is making a movie so that
we won't have to be embarrassed.

01:13:57.308 --> 01:13:58.651
What are you talking about?

01:13:58.726 --> 01:14:02.105
Sex out of wedlock is wrong.

01:14:02.188 --> 01:14:03.781
Get that member filled with pleasure!

01:14:03.856 --> 01:14:07.326
- I forbid the blood to enter your cock.
- Get it in that pussy. Go...

01:14:07.526 --> 01:14:08.493
- Phallus!
- Phallus.

01:14:08.569 --> 01:14:09.786
- I forbid...
- I'm the devil!

01:14:09.862 --> 01:14:13.207
- ...the blood to enter your phallus.
- I'm the devil. Fuck that pussy!

01:14:13.407 --> 01:14:16.160
- You big penis.
- Can you say "organ" instead?

01:14:16.243 --> 01:14:18.496
Motherfucker! Come here!

01:14:20.665 --> 01:14:22.884
Did you put my precious daughter
in a porno video?

01:14:22.959 --> 01:14:25.462
You are fucking dead, do you hear me?

01:14:25.544 --> 01:14:26.545
Shit.

01:14:26.837 --> 01:14:28.714
Time to die, motherfucker.

01:14:32.176 --> 01:14:33.598
Bruce, Bruce.

01:14:35.054 --> 01:14:36.556
Fuck.

01:14:36.639 --> 01:14:38.391
- Okay. Okay.
- Someone call an ambulance!

01:14:38.474 --> 01:14:39.896
Call 911. Call 911!

01:14:40.017 --> 01:14:41.564
- He shot me in my belly.
- Okay. I know, bro.

01:14:41.644 --> 01:14:43.988
I know.
Just keep breathing, just keep breathing.

01:14:44.063 --> 01:14:46.065
Just keep breathing.

01:14:48.609 --> 01:14:50.202
I knew you loved me, bro.

01:14:50.277 --> 01:14:53.156
You! When you grab me, go like this.
You gotta really hold me.

01:14:53.864 --> 01:14:55.912
- You want to go again, Jack?
- Let's go!

01:14:56.242 --> 01:14:57.915
He doesn't know anything.

01:14:57.994 --> 01:14:59.587
He just thinks that
he's playing the part of a father

01:14:59.662 --> 01:15:02.882
who found out his daughter's in a sex video.
It's fine.

01:15:03.624 --> 01:15:06.002
- You're such a fucking asshole!
- What?

01:15:06.085 --> 01:15:07.632
"What?" What's the matter with you?

01:15:07.712 --> 01:15:10.465
I just want an option in case
we decide to go dark in the end, bro.

01:15:10.548 --> 01:15:12.346
- Lassie, I'm sorry. Lassie.
- Leave me alone.

01:15:12.425 --> 01:15:13.847
- Lassie.
- Leave me alone!

01:15:16.595 --> 01:15:17.767
But it looked that realistic?

01:16:31.253 --> 01:16:33.130
Mom, stop fucking calling.

01:16:33.672 --> 01:16:35.390
It's not your mother.

01:16:35.925 --> 01:16:38.895
Unfortunately, I can't bear children.

01:16:40.221 --> 01:16:41.222
Whatever.

01:16:41.639 --> 01:16:46.645
<i>I saw Bruce's movie, along with,
I don't know, a few million other people.</i>

01:16:46.727 --> 01:16:49.697
And what the fuck was he thinking,
not letting me play the angel?

01:16:49.772 --> 01:16:52.150
That woman was absolute dog shit.

01:16:53.150 --> 01:16:54.868
So you still talk to that girl?

01:16:55.611 --> 01:16:58.535
<i>- She still mad at you?
- She won't take my calls.</i>

01:16:59.406 --> 01:17:01.329
She hasn't responded to any of my e-mails.

01:17:01.867 --> 01:17:04.666
Yeah, I heard through the grapevine
that she's going away.

01:17:05.454 --> 01:17:06.580
<i>Poor thing.</i>

01:17:06.705 --> 01:17:08.207
- Where?
- China.

01:17:09.708 --> 01:17:11.130
You think you're embarrassed?

01:17:11.210 --> 01:17:14.680
Try having half the planet watch
some guy not be able to fuck you all night.

01:17:15.631 --> 01:17:17.633
That's embarrassing, my friend.

01:17:19.593 --> 01:17:22.722
Anyway, I thought you should know
she's going away.

01:17:22.805 --> 01:17:26.025
Just in case one of the people
on this phone call

01:17:26.100 --> 01:17:28.068
wanted to start acting like a man, darling.

01:17:30.229 --> 01:17:33.403
Let your Auntie Phyllis give you
a piece of advice, Frankie, baby.

01:17:34.275 --> 01:17:38.325
I don't give a shit how many people saw
what happened in that clubhouse that night.

01:17:38.404 --> 01:17:40.623
And I don't care what they thought about it.

01:17:40.698 --> 01:17:43.417
They weren't there. They were just watching.

01:17:45.911 --> 01:17:49.131
If you really fell in love
with that girl that night,

01:17:50.291 --> 01:17:53.215
then what the fuck
are you still doing in the desert?

01:18:11.270 --> 01:18:12.442
Francis.

01:18:16.442 --> 01:18:17.443
Hey, bro.

01:18:23.324 --> 01:18:27.204
Listen, I know we haven't talked
since the whole angel debacle,

01:18:27.286 --> 01:18:29.129
and I just wanted to say I'm really sorry.

01:18:29.830 --> 01:18:33.334
After you left, I got to thinking,
maybe I'm incapable of change.

01:18:33.709 --> 01:18:34.881
But, look, no camera.

01:18:35.753 --> 01:18:37.721
- Well, I'm impressed.
- Right?

01:18:38.088 --> 01:18:40.182
- You proud of me?
- What time's her flight?

01:18:40.591 --> 01:18:43.891
7:00 p.m.
We better hit the road before we lose the light.

01:18:48.515 --> 01:18:50.313
Hey, Bruce,
can you help me with something in here?

01:18:50.392 --> 01:18:51.985
Sure.

01:18:54.647 --> 01:18:56.490
- You need a strong guy?
- Yeah.

01:19:00.361 --> 01:19:02.580
Frank! What're you doing?

01:19:02.655 --> 01:19:03.998
You're not filming this, Bruce.

01:19:04.823 --> 01:19:05.824
What?

01:19:06.492 --> 01:19:08.085
Plenty of food and water in there.

01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:10.333
There's even a mirror
in case you want to jerk off.

01:19:11.372 --> 01:19:13.249
TV gets Channel 6.

01:19:13.332 --> 01:19:16.176
I swear on Mom's tits,
I'm not gonna film you.

01:19:17.503 --> 01:19:19.005
Okay, maybe one shot.

01:19:19.838 --> 01:19:21.681
Maybe two.

01:19:22.508 --> 01:19:25.637
A master from far away! Bro!

01:19:25.719 --> 01:19:28.268
I just want to give you a happy ending.

01:19:31.350 --> 01:19:34.729
Frank! I love you.

01:20:04.550 --> 01:20:07.645
- Hey.
- Dad! Tell us when people come in!

01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:13.187
Excuse me?

01:20:37.082 --> 01:20:40.427
I am a strong, kind man dipped in metal.

01:20:40.919 --> 01:20:42.387
Dipped in metal.

01:20:44.590 --> 01:20:47.218
And I have come
to take you away from all of this.

01:20:48.093 --> 01:20:51.563
And to protect you and to defend you.

01:20:52.181 --> 01:20:54.934
And to apologise for sucking at it so far.

01:20:56.310 --> 01:20:58.529
Lassie, I know all about embarrassment.

01:20:58.604 --> 01:21:01.858
Eighteen million people
saw me throw up on my fiancée.

01:21:02.524 --> 01:21:05.448
And 35 million people saw my dick not work.

01:21:06.153 --> 01:21:09.282
I'm standing in front of you wearing a car.

01:21:10.115 --> 01:21:12.538
Don't go. It won't help.

01:21:16.830 --> 01:21:18.173
Frank.

01:21:20.292 --> 01:21:24.593
I really appreciate all of this effort, I just...

01:21:27.883 --> 01:21:31.729
I can't live here an more. I have to o.
<i>Y</i>

01:21:34.556 --> 01:21:36.149
I'm sorry.

01:22:07.172 --> 01:22:08.219
Come?

01:22:10.217 --> 01:22:12.390
Come and visit me.

01:22:12.845 --> 01:22:14.973
I could probably use a knight.

01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:24.694
I might have a little trouble
with the metal detector.

01:22:49.423 --> 01:22:52.472
<i>"Wow.
I've never had sex with a knight before."</i>

01:22:53.093 --> 01:22:55.642
<i>"I'm gonna fuck you
on the Round Table, bitch."</i>

01:23:00.684 --> 01:23:01.685
Cut!

01:25:02.889 --> 01:25:04.641
Felt real to me.
