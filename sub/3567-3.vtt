My song came true!

00:36.508 --> 00:38.318
Do you have a package for me today?

00:38.353 --> 00:41.352
Hold on. Let me see
what I've got here.

00:41.387 --> 00:43.730
Did you order a loaf of
bread with a stamp on it?

00:43.765 --> 00:46.436
- No.
- Did you order a jury summons

00:46.471 --> 00:49.470
- for R.J. Finkle?
- That's not me ...

00:49.505 --> 00:52.095
- I'm Steven.
- Oh, right, right, right ...

00:52.130 --> 00:54.473
Steven. Here it is ...
Steven Universe.

00:54.508 --> 00:57.712
Ha! This thing is
gonna help me save the world!

00:57.747 --> 01:01.030
Really? It says it's from
Wacky Sacks supply company.

01:01.031 --> 01:03.246
Garnet, Amethyst,
and Pearl think I

01:03.247 --> 01:05.461
shouldn't go on magic
adventures because I don't

01:05.495 --> 01:09.069
- know how to use my gem powers.
- That seems reasonable.

01:09.104 --> 01:11.160
But there are
other ways I can help.

01:11.195 --> 01:13.948
- With a Wacky Sack?
- Exactly!

01:13.983 --> 01:17.802
You know how you can save my world?

01:17.837 --> 01:21.328
- Sign here, please.
- Ah!

01:21.363 --> 01:24.403
Barb yells at me if
I don't get signatures.

01:24.438 --> 01:27.642
That's awful.

01:27.677 --> 01:29.774
Garnet, Amethyst,
and Pearl are back!

01:32.740 --> 01:33.812
W-wait! Steven!

01:33.847 --> 01:36.744
- What is a Wacky Sack?
- Huh?

01:36.779 --> 01:40.574
- Hello, Steven.
- Amethyst, we do not need that.

01:40.575 --> 01:43.304
- It's not going to fit in the fridge.
- What?

01:43.339 --> 01:48.429
I got this. Hup!

01:48.464 --> 01:50.233
Look ... it fits!

01:50.268 --> 01:54.784
Ha! Oh, man, we could make a
big omelet or a quiche or big

01:54.819 --> 01:57.423
- sunny-side-ups!
- We fought a giant bird.

01:57.458 --> 01:58.040
<i>We can bake it ...
That's a thing, right?</i>

01:58.041 --> 02:00.155
We're only here for a
second. We've got to go back out.

02:00.190 --> 02:03.230
- What? Why?
- We have to place this

02:03.265 --> 02:06.346
Moon goddess statue on the top
of the lunar sea spire before

02:06.381 --> 02:09.175
midnight. Without it,
the whole place will

02:09.210 --> 02:12.373
fall apart! Oh, Steven,
you should have seen

02:12.408 --> 02:17.334
the spire in its heyday. It was
an oasis for gems on Earth.

02:17.369 --> 02:21.434
It's abandoned now, but we can
still save it with this statue.

02:21.469 --> 02:23.648
Wha... that's perfect!

02:23.683 --> 02:26.354
- What? Why?
- Because I can help

02:26.389 --> 02:29.716
carry it for you... in this!
Whooosh!

02:29.751 --> 02:32.095
Whhhhhmmm!
Whhhhhsssw!

02:32.130 --> 02:36.113
- Pwing-pwing-pwing-pwing-pwing!
- A... hamburger?

02:36.148 --> 02:38.942
It's a novelty
backpack shaped like a

02:38.977 --> 02:41.566
cheeseburger!
Aw, I blew it.

02:41.601 --> 02:44.723
I was just gonna wear it one
day, and you guys would be like,

02:44.758 --> 02:48.987
"Dang, Steven, that's so cool!"
but this is obviously important

02:49.022 --> 02:51.570
- gem business.
- Yes, so you should let

02:51.605 --> 02:55.547
- us take care of it.
- What? I'm a gem!

02:58.774 --> 03:00.795
But you've still got a lot to learn.

03:00.830 --> 03:04.813
So let him come.
It'll be educational.

03:04.848 --> 03:08.974
Hmm. All right.
You can carry it in your hamburger.

03:10.288 --> 03:12.357
Mm! Check this out ...

03:12.392 --> 03:16.744
everything's a pocket!
Even the cheese is a pocket!

03:16.779 --> 03:18.425
I can fit a lot more stuff in here.

03:18.460 --> 03:21.541
Give me a minute.
I'll pack extra supplies.

03:29.325 --> 03:32.365
-  Kid, don't shake me!
- Mr. Queasy!

03:32.400 --> 03:34.866
<i>Ohh, I got a medical condition.</i>

03:34.901 --> 03:37.408
You're definitely
gonna come in handy.

03:37.443 --> 03:41.385
- Ugh!
- Steven, let's go!

03:41.420 --> 03:45.198
- Uh, coming!
- Whoa, Steven, did you

03:45.233 --> 03:48.139
- bring your whole room?
- Back that thang up.

03:48.174 --> 03:50.831
Let's warp.

03:51.670 --> 03:55.653
Suck it in, Steven!

03:55.688 --> 03:58.031
Do you remember how to do this?

04:00.161 --> 04:02.254
Oh!
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

04:04.445 --> 04:06.600
Keep your head in.
Come on!

04:12.089 --> 04:15.498
Whoa! The sea spire!

04:15.533 --> 04:19.721
<i>Ohh.</i>

04:19.755 --> 04:23.633
It wasn't like this a hundred years ago.

04:23.634 --> 04:29.209
- I'm sensing structural instability.
- Oh, yeah, that's never good.

04:29.210 --> 04:32.390
- Gah! Steven!
- What?

04:36.152 --> 04:38.868
All right, hold on.
We're taking Steven back!

04:38.903 --> 04:41.820
<i> My achin' stomach!</i>

04:41.855 --> 04:44.649
- Oh, Mr. Queasy!
- Kid, you're killin' me.

04:44.684 --> 04:47.150
Steven! This
place is your heritage!

04:47.185 --> 04:50.348
I want you to stay and help, but
you've really got to take this

04:50.383 --> 04:53.587
Seriously.
Can you do that, Steven?

04:53.622 --> 04:59.037
- You got it, dude!
- Yes.

04:59.116 --> 05:02.156
Enough. We have to move.

05:05.820 --> 05:09.044
What's the holdup?
We can clear this easily.

05:09.079 --> 05:12.365
No. The magic that
sustains the whirlpool creates

05:12.400 --> 05:14.781
a vortex that will pull us below.

05:17.655 --> 05:19.335
So we can't jump?

05:19.370 --> 05:22.656
- Oh, wait!
- What are those for?

05:22.691 --> 05:25.567
They were for
keeping warm, but check it out.

05:29.866 --> 05:31.243
- Whoa!
- Steven!

05:31.278 --> 05:32.250
- Wait!
- Whoa! Oh!

05:33.372 --> 05:34.650
<i>He's getting sucked down!</i>

05:34.685 --> 05:38.227
<i> Steven!</i>

05:38.423 --> 05:43.894
Cheesebur-r-r-r-ger!

05:47.086 --> 05:50.783
Steven, way to go!
Come on, guys!

05:54.344 --> 05:59.393
Hyup!
♪ Steven-style ♪

06:00.785 --> 06:05.385
- Don't ever do that again!
- Sorry.

06:06.152 --> 06:08.905
But... it was pretty great.

06:10.806 --> 06:13.087
Oh, no, no, no. This
is even worse than the

06:13.122 --> 06:16.572
outside. Ugh!
That's ... oh!

06:16.607 --> 06:22.517
Oh, this didn't used to be so ...
oh, and the water damage...

06:22.552 --> 06:27.150
this pillar...
oh, and this had a head.

06:27.185 --> 06:30.635
Oh, Steven, once the statue's in
place, it'll restore all of this

06:30.670 --> 06:33.013
to its former glory ...

06:34.048 --> 06:35.965
What was that goober?

06:36.000 --> 06:40.565
- Crystal shrimp.
- You guys, we got a problem.

06:42.847 --> 06:45.969
It's an infestation! And
we have to pass through

06:46.004 --> 06:50.458
- there to get to the top.
- Can't you just squish 'em?

06:50.493 --> 06:52.731
Don't touch that!
Their shards are deadly!

06:52.732 --> 06:54.210
We need to clear a path.

06:54.245 --> 06:57.941
Amethyst, if you go around to
the side and disturb them

06:57.976 --> 07:01.385
with a spin attack...
and, Garnet, if you move to the

07:01.420 --> 07:04.337
ceiling and strike this exact spot...

07:04.372 --> 07:08.724
- then I can advance with my ...
- Bagel sandwich!

07:13.269 --> 07:17.591
- Brilliant.
- Oh, hey. What do you know?

07:17.592 --> 07:21.516
Uh, uh.
How did you know that would work?

07:21.551 --> 07:24.427
Well, if I were a
shrimp, that's what I would do.

07:24.462 --> 07:28.035
- You are a shrimp.
- I just want everyone

07:28.070 --> 07:32.190
to know ... my plan
would have also worked.

07:32.581 --> 07:34.596
Watch out!

07:34.631 --> 07:39.151
- Whoa!
- What are we gonna do?

07:41.065 --> 07:44.149
- What ... me?
- What have you got?

07:44.184 --> 07:46.363
Cheeseburger backpack!

- Yeah, they can't all be winners.

08:38.227 --> 08:42.164
This is it ...
the Moon goddess pedestal.

08:42.198 --> 08:47.453
And the Moon is almost overhead!
It's not too late to save this

08:47.488 --> 08:51.594
- piece of history!
- Steven, the statue.

08:57.407 --> 09:02.459
Uh, I-I, uh...
Uh, uh, I...

09:02.494 --> 09:06.595
- What's the holdup?
- I don't have it.

09:06.630 --> 09:08.138
What?!

09:08.173 --> 09:10.619
I must have
left it on the bed!

09:13.073 --> 09:16.154
There's ... there's no time!

09:16.189 --> 09:18.532
Wait! I have an idea!

09:18.567 --> 09:21.556
- Ugh!
- Ah.

09:22.599 --> 09:26.035
- Could that work?
- Mm-mnh-mnh.

Everyone, keep steady!

10:05.225 --> 10:06.912
Whoa! Ohh!

10:07.179 --> 10:09.044
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

10:30.071 --> 10:32.783
This is all my fault. I broke it!

10:32.818 --> 10:37.221
No, Steven, the spire
was falling apart when we got here.

10:37.256 --> 10:40.368
You handled everything well
under pressure. You did great.

10:40.401 --> 10:44.456
Yeah, 2 out of 4 of
your ideas worked ... that's 50%.

10:44.558 --> 10:49.731
Yeah, I guess you're
right ... they can't all be winners.

11:34.604 --> 11:36.107

One, two, three...

11:55.901 --> 11:57.997

Pearl! Garnet!

12:19.633 --> 12:24.489

12:26.668 --> 12:28.978
That thing's too good

12:28.980 --> 12:32.782
It's a... together breakfast.

12:36.104 --> 12:39.422
Ah, Garnet! Perfect.

12:39.424 --> 12:43.126
Check it out. It's not exactly
healthy, but it's in a stack,

12:43.128 --> 12:48.604
so I guess you could say it's a...
balanced breakfast.

12:52.403 --> 12:55.054
You know, like, I made us all

12:55.056 --> 12:56.571
breakfast. I thought
we could eat together like ...

12:56.658 --> 12:59.308
- like best buds.
- I can't stay.

12:59.310 --> 13:02.805
There's business to attend
to inside the temple.

13:08.268 --> 13:11.654
Aw, business?
Like what?

13:11.656 --> 13:13.513
I have to burn this.

13:17.095 --> 13:19.265
Cool!

13:19.357 --> 13:22.362
- Uh!
- I have to burn this, too.

13:23.929 --> 13:26.586
No! My apps!

13:45.523 --> 13:48.741
Oh, man.

13:48.743 --> 13:51.003
I totally got you.
You should have seen

13:51.027 --> 13:53.729
- the look on your face.
- Oh, I knew it was you.

13:53.731 --> 13:55.731
How?

13:55.733 --> 13:58.951
'Cause that's a
water gun, and I'm not dumb.

13:58.953 --> 14:00.632
You got
something on your shirt.

14:00.837 --> 14:03.524
Duuuuh-umb.

14:11.559 --> 14:14.918
Hey! That's my door.

14:17.478 --> 14:19.870
Oh, Amethyst, there you are.

14:19.871 --> 14:22.263
Care to explain what one of my

14:22.361 --> 14:26.586
- swords was doing in your room?
- Having a sword party.

14:26.597 --> 14:30.566
- Oh, please! You took it.
- I did not!

14:30.568 --> 14:32.568
It's fine.
It's in the past.

14:32.570 --> 14:34.603
I forgive you.

14:34.605 --> 14:36.629
Also, I cleaned
up your awful, awful mess.

14:36.634 --> 14:38.541
- You're welcome.
- You did what?!

14:38.543 --> 14:41.926
- I have a system!
- Amethyst! Wait!

14:41.961 --> 14:45.174
- What's the matter, Steven?
- I wanted us all to

14:45.254 --> 14:48.694
have breakfast together, so
I made together breakfast,

14:48.780 --> 14:51.838
- but everyone keeps leaving.
- Oh, that's nice.

14:56.268 --> 14:59.896
Oh, no! Not you, too.

14:59.898 --> 15:02.198
I can't let this become together brunch.

15:08.273 --> 15:09.438
Wha...?

15:19.286 --> 15:23.159
Hmm. There we go.

15:24.672 --> 15:25.665
Ahh!

15:28.292 --> 15:30.224
Hey, Pearl!

15:30.661 --> 15:31.987
Steven!

15:32.063 --> 15:34.836
What are you doing in here?
You know it's dangerous for you

15:34.924 --> 15:38.169
- inside the temple.
- We're gonna have a nice

15:38.247 --> 15:41.368
together breakfast even
if I have to get my shoes wet.

15:42.158 --> 15:44.080
What?!

15:44.104 --> 15:48.197
- Get out of there!
- I'll swim it over to you. See?

15:48.451 --> 15:52.472
Doggy paddle, forward.
Oh, gosh.

15:52.506 --> 15:55.664
Wait.
Uh, doggy paddle, reverse.

15:55.757 --> 15:58.350
- Reverse!
- Steven!

16:03.871 --> 16:05.701
What the...?

16:07.402 --> 16:10.549
Whoa!

16:13.137 --> 16:15.721
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

16:15.723 --> 16:19.584
whoa, whoa!
Keep it together, breakfast!

16:30.815 --> 16:33.572
- Better.
- Amethyst!

16:33.574 --> 16:36.711
Oh, hey, Steven.
Did you come down the waterfall?

16:36.788 --> 16:40.246
Pearl gets so mad that I
have her junk, but it's always

16:40.282 --> 16:42.998
- falling down here.
- Junk like what?

16:43.117 --> 16:45.135
Junk like... you!

16:45.136 --> 16:47.920
I'm gonna throw you in the junk pile.

16:48.922 --> 16:50.539
Isn't it awful?

16:50.541 --> 16:53.843
- Pearl organized everything.
- It still looks messy to me.

16:53.845 --> 16:57.890
Aw, thanks.
I try. Boom!

16:57.916 --> 17:01.083
- Oh, what's that, Steven?
- It's a together breakfast.

17:01.085 --> 17:04.329
- All right! Snacks!
- No! It's for everyone

17:04.410 --> 17:09.017
to eat together. That's the
essence of together breakfast.

17:09.018 --> 17:13.362
Ahh. Give me! Give me!

17:15.430 --> 17:17.393
We have to eat it together!

17:23.555 --> 17:25.392
Huh?

17:25.656 --> 17:30.003
Whoa!

17:32.108 --> 17:33.916
You can't outrun me!

17:33.918 --> 17:36.669
We both have short legs.

17:39.546 --> 17:44.865
- Huh? What?!
- Steven! I'm hungry!

17:45.507 --> 17:48.869
Just hold on!
An exit!

17:48.940 --> 17:51.006
Whoo!

17:51.894 --> 17:55.347
- Skills!
- Get back here.

17:55.828 --> 17:58.096
You're completely
missing the point of this.

18:00.187 --> 18:02.192
Hey, wait a second.

18:02.223 --> 18:04.336
<i>Steven! There you are.</i>

18:04.448 --> 18:06.573
Pearl!
Sweet! Two out of three.

18:06.718 --> 18:12.989
- Oh, oh! Steven, be careful.
- Why? Wha...?

18:13.109 --> 18:15.988
Whoa.

18:16.218 --> 18:18.844
You really shouldn't be in here.

18:18.846 --> 18:22.509
This is the crystal heart.
Oh! It's connected to the most

18:22.556 --> 18:25.966
dangerous areas of the temple.
Hold on tight

18:26.042 --> 18:31.280
- and don't look down.
- Huh?

18:32.427 --> 18:33.846
Oh!

18:38.077 --> 18:41.455
Oh, hey.
This isn't so bad.

18:41.475 --> 18:43.527
Uh, never mind.

18:43.707 --> 18:46.650
Whoa!

18:56.589 --> 18:58.524
Aw.

19:11.354 --> 19:14.066
<i>Steven, we're
getting you out of here.</i>

19:14.068 --> 19:15.195
- Come on.
- Huh?

19:15.409 --> 19:18.050
This is great!
We're all together!

19:18.104 --> 19:19.989
Huh?

19:19.991 --> 19:23.071
We can finally eat.
I mean, we don't have any forks,

19:23.123 --> 19:26.479
but we can use our hands.
I'm not gonna judge.

19:26.628 --> 19:29.647
- Steven, go!
- Okay.

19:29.839 --> 19:32.918
Want to meet in the kitchen?

19:35.123 --> 19:36.211
Whoa!

19:37.650 --> 19:41.018
It's trying to escape.
Force it back.

19:44.260 --> 19:46.599
Get back!

19:51.853 --> 19:54.093
<i> Steven!</i>

20:00.819 --> 20:02.271
Together breakfast?

20:07.238 --> 20:09.861
It's taken
refuge in organic matter.

20:10.494 --> 20:13.409
Now it has all
the power of a breakfast.

20:13.411 --> 20:17.087
- We have to destroy it.
- It's horrible!

20:23.048 --> 20:27.096
I didn't want this.
I just wanted to eat

20:27.183 --> 20:30.179
together like ... like best buds.

20:30.439 --> 20:32.547
Steven,
you've got to get away.

20:32.667 --> 20:35.019
But my breakfast.

20:38.021 --> 20:39.593
That's enough!

20:39.679 --> 20:43.018
I don't care if you...

20:43.019 --> 20:48.612
are the most important
meal of the day.

20:51.348 --> 20:57.179
I made you to bring us
together, not to tear us apart!

21:09.526 --> 21:13.127
I'm sorry, guys.
I guess I dreamed too big.

21:31.878 --> 21:33.437
It looks great.

21:33.539 --> 21:37.254
It's even more together
and even more breakfast.

21:49.581 --> 21:52.335
- I don't think I can eat this.
- Let's order a pizza.

21:52.419 --> 21:54.493
- Pizza's a better idea.
- Yeah. It's good.

21:54.716 --> 21:57.200
- Definitely.
- It did try to kill us.
