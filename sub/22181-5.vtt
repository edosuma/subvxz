WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 00:03.237
[Kara] My name is Kara Zor-El.

00:03.271 --> 00:06.440
I am from Krypton,
I am a refugee on this planet.

00:06.740 --> 00:09.443
I was sent to Earth
to protect my cousin.

00:09.477 --> 00:11.379
But my pod got
knocked off-course

00:11.412 --> 00:12.813
and by the time I got here,

00:12.846 --> 00:16.750
my cousin
had already grown up
and become Superman.

00:18.086 --> 00:19.853
I hid who I really was

00:19.887 --> 00:24.225
until one day
when an accident forced me
to reveal myself to the world.

00:24.258 --> 00:27.461
To most people, I'm a reporter
at CatCo Worldwide Media.

00:27.495 --> 00:31.132
But in secret, I work with my
adoptive sister for the DEO

00:31.165 --> 00:33.301
to protect my city
from alien life

00:33.334 --> 00:35.436
and anyone else
that means to cause it harm.

00:36.737 --> 00:38.739
I am Supergirl.

00:40.508 --> 00:42.343
[Kara]
Previously on Supergirl...

00:44.112 --> 00:46.514
One day soon, you will reign.

00:48.482 --> 00:50.084
Maggie doesn't wanna have kids.

00:50.118 --> 00:53.521
[crying] I wanna be a mom,
what am I gonna do?

00:53.554 --> 00:55.389
[Lena] My daughter has a way
to save us.

00:55.423 --> 00:56.757
It's a device
that my brother invented.

00:56.790 --> 01:00.661
I think I can convert it
to irradiate the atmosphere
with lead.

01:02.796 --> 01:03.831
I could ruin you.

01:03.864 --> 01:06.634
You are gonna so regret
the day you screwed me.

01:06.667 --> 01:10.771
Because now,
you have all of my attention.

01:21.382 --> 01:24.185
Ten and two. Watch the road.

01:30.558 --> 01:31.792
-[crashing]
-[tires screech]

01:40.534 --> 01:41.535
[grunting]

01:41.569 --> 01:45.306
You come closer,
your eyes glow,
you even flinch,

01:45.339 --> 01:48.642
-and I open up his throat.
-No, you won't.

01:50.678 --> 01:52.146
[grunting]

01:57.318 --> 01:58.319
[groans]

01:59.353 --> 02:00.721
Anyone else?

02:03.857 --> 02:05.359
You holdin' up okay?

02:06.194 --> 02:07.195
No.

02:07.895 --> 02:09.297
It's happening tomorrow?

02:10.398 --> 02:11.399
Yeah.

02:23.877 --> 02:25.346
Mom, are you okay?

02:26.447 --> 02:27.715
What? Yes.

02:27.748 --> 02:29.450
Babe, of course. I'm fine.

02:29.483 --> 02:31.319
I'm totally fine.
It was just a dream.

02:31.752 --> 02:32.886
You were awake.

02:33.454 --> 02:36.590
Ruby, I'm fine.
It was a migraine.

02:36.624 --> 02:38.326
Look, we're up next.

02:38.359 --> 02:39.860
Get your backpack.

02:39.893 --> 02:41.929
-I love you.
-Love you, too.

02:43.931 --> 02:45.499
-Bye.
-Have a good day. Bye.

02:48.936 --> 02:51.272
Hey, did you
get your math homework done?

02:51.305 --> 02:52.740
I couldn't get through it.

02:52.773 --> 02:54.608
Well, there's still time before
the bell if you want me
to help you.

02:54.642 --> 02:57.378
-Yeah. That'd be...
-You okay?

02:59.847 --> 03:02.250
Luke! Mom, help!
[panting]

03:02.850 --> 03:05.453
Mom! It's okay, it's okay.

03:05.886 --> 03:06.920
It's okay.

03:07.421 --> 03:09.623
Oh, please.
It's okay, it's okay.

03:11.725 --> 03:16.230
Ms. Luthor, um, you approved
an advertorial on page six.

03:16.264 --> 03:17.765
Is there a question coming?

03:17.798 --> 03:18.999
Well, I...

03:19.032 --> 03:21.269
[clears throat] I just wish
you would have told me first.

03:21.302 --> 03:23.637
I didn't know ads were
in your purview, Mr. Olsen.

03:23.671 --> 03:25.673
Well, they're...
they're not in my purview.

03:25.706 --> 03:27.941
It's... it's not a big deal,
it's just that

03:27.975 --> 03:29.910
if we're gonna
disguise ads as articles

03:29.943 --> 03:31.945
I think that it sends
a bad message.

03:31.979 --> 03:33.647
People wanna know what
they're getting, you know?

03:33.681 --> 03:35.683
They expect integrity from us.

03:35.716 --> 03:36.950
Just a perception thing.

03:37.518 --> 03:38.752
70%.

03:40.388 --> 03:41.789
-Excuse me?
-That's the deep discount

03:41.822 --> 03:43.857
on our print
subscription rate. 70%.

03:43.891 --> 03:45.693
That's what it takes
just to get people to read.

03:45.726 --> 03:48.696
So I think an advertorial
here and there
is a necessary evil.

03:49.430 --> 03:51.432
-[chuckles]
-[knock on door]

03:51.465 --> 03:52.266
[Kara] Everything okay?

03:53.567 --> 03:55.469
-Yeah.
-Absolutely. [clears throat]

03:55.869 --> 03:58.972
Good. Uh, James, I just came in
to check and see if...

04:00.708 --> 04:03.677
Actually, I think you're gonna
wanna turn up the TV.

04:07.848 --> 04:09.817
What is that scumbag
doing in my hospital?

04:09.850 --> 04:11.419
[Morgan on TV]
It was a nightmare.

04:11.452 --> 04:13.487
And we would've given
anything for it to end,
am I right?

04:13.521 --> 04:16.957
Then the Daxamites,
the ships just up and left.

04:16.990 --> 04:18.225
You know why they left?

04:18.258 --> 04:21.495
It was a lead-dispersal bomb
that drove 'em away.

04:21.529 --> 04:23.864
I have a colleague
whose son was sick.

04:23.897 --> 04:27.835
Brought him here. There were
other children in this hospital
with the same symptoms.

04:27.868 --> 04:29.737
The doctors told me
that there were other children

04:29.770 --> 04:31.739
in still other hospitals

04:31.772 --> 04:33.741
all displaying
the same symptoms.

04:34.642 --> 04:35.876
Lead poisoning.

04:37.445 --> 04:38.946
You know, it's fitting
that we're here,
in this hospital.

04:40.414 --> 04:44.985
Lena Luthor built
the bomb that poisoned
these boys and girls.

04:45.018 --> 04:46.086
[reporter]
Do you have any proof?

04:46.119 --> 04:47.788
-[reporters clamoring]
-I've gotta get down there.

04:49.022 --> 04:50.257
[Morgan] Keep it down.
Please respect the children.

04:50.290 --> 04:51.792
Let's take it outside,
I'll answer your questions.

04:54.528 --> 04:55.729
[door opens]

05:01.869 --> 05:03.704
I was hoping
you'd take longer getting home.

05:03.904 --> 05:05.406
I thought about it.

05:07.908 --> 05:09.577
That's only gonna get harder.

05:10.077 --> 05:11.512
I don't wanna feel like this.

05:12.646 --> 05:15.749
-I love you.
-Yeah. I love you...
I love you back.

05:16.484 --> 05:17.618
I, uh...

05:19.553 --> 05:23.624
[sighs] This can't be it.
This is stupid. This is...

05:25.393 --> 05:26.794
We've talked this through.

05:27.528 --> 05:28.596
-Right?
-Mmm-hmm.

05:28.629 --> 05:30.531
I mean, for days.

05:32.065 --> 05:35.969
Can you do that again?
Can... can you go
another couple rounds?

05:36.970 --> 05:38.706
Because I can't.

05:41.074 --> 05:43.110
Are you ever gonna wanna
have kids?

05:45.913 --> 05:47.515
[tearfully] I want you.

05:48.816 --> 05:49.817
Yeah, I know, babe.

05:53.454 --> 05:54.522
[softly] But I want kids.

05:58.426 --> 06:00.127
I'm always gonna want kids.

06:03.030 --> 06:04.698
Then there's nothing else left.

06:06.800 --> 06:07.935
You have to say it.

06:08.702 --> 06:10.003
Maggie...

06:10.037 --> 06:11.705
You have to say it out loud.

06:12.973 --> 06:14.442
Please?

06:15.476 --> 06:16.477
[sighs]

06:20.848 --> 06:22.015
We can't be together.

06:25.085 --> 06:26.086
[sniffles]

06:33.894 --> 06:34.662
[sniffles]

06:37.865 --> 06:39.700
[woman speaks
indistinctly on PA]

06:45.539 --> 06:46.774
[Kara] Sam?

06:46.807 --> 06:48.576
-What are you doing here?
-Hey.

06:49.042 --> 06:52.012
Luke, one of Ruby's friends,
collapsed this morning.

06:52.045 --> 06:53.113
Lead poisoning.

06:54.214 --> 06:55.849
I came with the paramedics,
his mom just got here.

06:55.883 --> 06:58.486
I saw Edge's stunt, too.
This whole thing is awful.

06:58.519 --> 07:00.721
-[Morgan] All right,
where do I sign?
-Lena?

07:00.754 --> 07:02.490
Where the hell do you get off?

07:05.626 --> 07:07.060
Thank you.

07:07.094 --> 07:10.531
That was me paying
the end of the medical expenses
at your hospital.

07:10.564 --> 07:11.865
So this is what
your revenge looks like?

07:13.066 --> 07:16.003
Have you ever heard
of the cobra effect, Lena?

07:17.170 --> 07:19.840
Colonial India,
the British government,

07:20.207 --> 07:23.477
they realized
there were snakes
all over Delhi.

07:23.511 --> 07:24.778
They wanted them gone.

07:25.546 --> 07:27.848
So they offered
a bounty for dead snakes.

07:29.049 --> 07:32.486
And then they realized
people were breeding snakes
for income.

07:32.520 --> 07:34.622
They thought
everything was going
really well.

07:34.655 --> 07:37.190
They realized they got
slithering snakes
all over Delhi.

07:37.925 --> 07:39.560
The whole thing backfired.

07:40.160 --> 07:42.029
Turns out
they made the problem worse.

07:44.532 --> 07:45.533
You understand?

07:46.600 --> 07:49.770
-You're a toxic predator.
-Unintended consequences.

07:50.904 --> 07:53.741
You wanted to be a hero so bad
you didn't care who you hurt.

07:54.942 --> 07:56.209
Now people are gonna die.

07:56.243 --> 07:57.878
Even if all of this were true,

07:57.911 --> 07:59.980
Supergirl would be
just as much to blame.

08:00.013 --> 08:02.149
She made the call
to use that device.

08:02.182 --> 08:05.619
Supergirl may have
pushed the button, sure,

08:05.653 --> 08:07.688
but that tech was all Luthor.

08:09.890 --> 08:12.660
-You're a bottom-feeder.
-But I didn't poison children.

08:13.961 --> 08:15.095
That was you.

08:25.172 --> 08:27.307
[woman on TV] Morgan Edge's
accusation of Lena Luthor...

08:27.340 --> 08:29.710
Ms. Luthor, is there anything
I can get for you?

08:29.743 --> 08:31.545
Call the CDC and get
every report they have
on the outbreak.

08:31.579 --> 08:33.180
I also need
the victims' medical reports

08:33.213 --> 08:35.115
and I wanna see
every bit of data
Morgan Edge has seen.

08:35.148 --> 08:37.618
Right away.
And, uh, I'm so sorry.

08:40.087 --> 08:41.622
There has to be
another explanation.

08:42.756 --> 08:44.124
There could be
hundreds of other reasons

08:44.157 --> 08:46.560
why these kids are getting sick
besides your device.

08:46.594 --> 08:48.228
I mean,
Edge is manipulating people

08:48.261 --> 08:50.598
to get revenge on you
for buying CatCo.

08:50.631 --> 08:52.733
He's ruthless, Lena,
you know that.

08:52.766 --> 08:54.134
Look, what if it's true, okay?

08:54.167 --> 08:58.005
I told Supergirl that
the lead in the device
was safe for humans.

08:58.038 --> 09:00.007
She wouldn't have used it
if it wasn't safe.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.142
Yes, but using it
saved all of us.

09:02.175 --> 09:04.211
-[James] Ms. Luthor.
-Mr. Olsen.

09:04.244 --> 09:06.046
Come to tell Kara
"I told you so"?

09:06.079 --> 09:08.649
-[sighs]
-Another Luthor takes
innocent lives, news at 11?

09:08.682 --> 09:10.350
Ms. Luthor,
despite our differences,

09:10.383 --> 09:12.720
I would hope by now that you
would recognize that I see you

09:12.753 --> 09:14.154
as more than just an extension
of your brother.

09:15.656 --> 09:17.791
However, I do think that
you should get ahead
of this thing.

09:19.126 --> 09:21.061
Which, in my opinion...

09:22.262 --> 09:24.064
I think you should
step down from CatCo,

09:24.097 --> 09:26.767
so whatever we report,
good or bad,

09:26.800 --> 09:28.135
comes off as truthful.

09:28.736 --> 09:30.604
No, that would look
like an admission of guilt.

09:30.638 --> 09:32.673
[Lena] No, Kara, he's right.

09:33.373 --> 09:36.610
Whatever's happening,
whoever's responsible,
this is a public crisis.

09:36.644 --> 09:39.613
And the public deserves
to be able to trust
the reporting

09:39.647 --> 09:41.248
so that they can
prepare themselves.

09:41.281 --> 09:42.750
They expect integrity from us.

09:43.651 --> 09:45.653
They deserve it, and they
need it now more than ever.

09:48.321 --> 09:50.791
Mr. Olsen, you will run CatCo
until this is resolved,

09:50.824 --> 09:54.294
and I think I should
also step down from L-Corp.

09:54.695 --> 09:56.797
Lena, we need you.
We need you to help guide
the research.

09:56.830 --> 10:00.100
No, no, L-Corp has
a brain trust that's
more than capable, okay?

10:00.133 --> 10:03.070
If I'm involved, I could be
accused of covering things up,

10:03.103 --> 10:05.706
or even profiting
from the sick. [sighs]

10:06.373 --> 10:07.808
This can't be
like Flint, Michigan, okay,

10:07.841 --> 10:10.343
where bureaucracy
got in the way.

10:10.377 --> 10:12.145
Helping people
has to be the focus.

10:12.846 --> 10:15.215
Where is she?
Where's Lena Luthor?

10:15.248 --> 10:16.316
Sir! Sir, please calm down.

10:16.349 --> 10:18.652
I need to see her.
She needs to answer for my son.

10:24.457 --> 10:25.793
You know he stopped breathing?

10:26.326 --> 10:28.395
They had to put
a tube down his throat.

10:28.428 --> 10:29.863
My boy is 12 years old.

10:30.864 --> 10:33.133
He is supposed to be laughing,

10:33.166 --> 10:35.402
outside playing,
not stuck in some hospital

10:35.435 --> 10:37.671
with the doctors telling me
they don't know how to fix him.

10:38.305 --> 10:40.373
You rich people, you think
you can do whatever you want,

10:40.407 --> 10:41.775
that we don't matter.

10:41.809 --> 10:43.443
My son matters.

10:43.476 --> 10:45.245
-I am sorry. I--
-You're sorry?

10:45.278 --> 10:47.781
You're gonna answer
for what you did to my son.

10:47.815 --> 10:49.416
For what you did
to all of them.

10:53.721 --> 10:54.822
[shudders]

10:58.325 --> 10:59.727
I want your best reporter
reporting this.

10:59.760 --> 11:01.294
I'm not hiding anything.

11:02.229 --> 11:03.697
Set a press conference
for later today.

11:08.368 --> 11:09.402
[sighs]

11:09.436 --> 11:12.339
[protesters chanting]
Lock her up! Lock her up!

11:12.372 --> 11:14.942
Lock her up! Lock her up!

11:23.917 --> 11:25.786
It's time, Ms. Luthor.

11:26.920 --> 11:29.923
[chanting continues]
Lock her up! Lock her up!

11:40.801 --> 11:42.202
Good afternoon.

11:42.235 --> 11:43.503
I'm... I'm Lena Luthor.

11:43.536 --> 11:45.906
-[indistinct shouting]
-I know a lot of you here
are angry.

11:45.939 --> 11:47.274
I... I hear you.

11:48.876 --> 11:51.945
I would be, myself,
if I felt someone
had poisoned my children.

11:51.979 --> 11:55.749
So, my thoughts go out
to everyone who is afflicted.

11:56.950 --> 11:58.886
I heard what Morgan Edge
told you this morning.

11:58.919 --> 12:01.221
And I wish I was up here
to say something different,

12:01.254 --> 12:06.326
but... the truth is,
I don't know if
my device hurt children.

12:07.828 --> 12:10.998
And until I do, I realize
that none of you
can have faith in me.

12:11.932 --> 12:12.933
[faint gun cocking]

12:17.304 --> 12:20.507
Your faith is something
I have worked harder
than you may realize

12:20.540 --> 12:23.877
to keep, and the fact
that I might have lost it

12:23.911 --> 12:24.845
breaks my heart.

12:27.480 --> 12:28.748
And so,

12:28.782 --> 12:32.986
until the investigation
into the poisonings
is concluded,

12:33.020 --> 12:34.788
I shall be stepping down from--

12:34.822 --> 12:36.756
[gunshots]

12:37.858 --> 12:38.926
-[crowd screaming]
-[James groans]

12:43.463 --> 12:44.531
[crying]

12:47.935 --> 12:49.336
[groaning]

12:52.272 --> 12:54.774
Help! Somebody help me!

12:56.376 --> 12:57.010
[Kara] James...

13:01.314 --> 13:03.817
Jeez, if that bullet
had a little more
stopping power,

13:03.851 --> 13:06.186
your shoulder would be a mess.

13:06.386 --> 13:07.821
Yeah. That's what
you said last time.

13:07.855 --> 13:10.557
Edge riled them up,
he knew what he was doing.

13:10.590 --> 13:13.193
The shooter just found out
that her son took a turn
for the worse.

13:13.226 --> 13:14.895
I'm not making any excuses,

13:14.928 --> 13:18.098
but she just went after
who she thought
was responsible.

13:18.131 --> 13:20.300
What are you saying?
You still think that Lena

13:20.333 --> 13:21.869
is responsible
for what's happening?

13:21.902 --> 13:23.270
I'm not saying
that she did this,

13:23.303 --> 13:25.839
I'm just saying that
maybe this happened
because of what she did.

13:25.873 --> 13:28.575
-Semantics.
-She jerry-rigged that device

13:28.608 --> 13:30.844
to do something
it was never intended to do.

13:31.344 --> 13:33.613
Look, I know
you don't wanna hear this,

13:33.646 --> 13:36.183
but that device
was invented by Lex Luthor.

13:36.483 --> 13:39.252
[stammers] Which is why
we're testing it.

13:40.220 --> 13:41.521
Then let's test it.

13:42.722 --> 13:43.924
Okay, so I sealed off the room
to contain the lead cloud.

13:43.957 --> 13:48.328
We have some sensors
that will analyze
the particulate.

13:48.361 --> 13:50.630
So how will you know
if the device is the cause?

13:50.663 --> 13:53.200
Okay, so when Lena and I
crunched the numbers
during the invasion,

13:53.233 --> 13:58.005
like, 99.96% of the molecules
bonded to Daxamite genes.

13:58.038 --> 14:01.641
Which basically means
that if it hits a human,
it evaporates. No harm done.

14:01.674 --> 14:04.978
The rest, you know, 0.04%,
we chalked up
to margin of error.

14:05.012 --> 14:07.881
So as long as we get the same
number today, we're good.

14:07.915 --> 14:09.382
-Okay. Hit it.
-Great.

14:09.917 --> 14:11.184
[device powers up]

14:15.255 --> 14:16.356
Okay. Anything?

14:16.389 --> 14:19.059
No. Hold, please. It is...

14:19.092 --> 14:20.227
-What?
-Whoo.

14:20.260 --> 14:21.861
Winn, what's the percentage?

14:22.930 --> 14:25.098
[clicks tongue] Um...

14:27.968 --> 14:31.538
So there is a 10% chance
the device is the cause?

14:32.005 --> 14:33.540
10.21.

14:43.583 --> 14:45.052
Someone just...
[breathing shakily]

14:45.585 --> 14:46.586
Someone just tried to kill me,

14:46.619 --> 14:48.388
I shouldn't be putting you
and Ruby in danger.

14:48.421 --> 14:50.257
That woman is in custody.

14:50.290 --> 14:52.425
No one will be looking
for you here, you're safe.

14:53.060 --> 14:55.428
So take your Louis Vuittons
off, relax, and chug this.

14:55.462 --> 14:58.431
-Really isn't necessary.
-Stop it, you're dehydrated.

14:59.266 --> 15:00.533
You could have been shot.

15:00.567 --> 15:01.568
You shouldn't be hiding me.

15:01.601 --> 15:03.937
You gave me a break
when I needed it the most.

15:05.072 --> 15:06.373
Let me return the favor.

15:13.346 --> 15:15.415
-One night.
-Great.

15:15.983 --> 15:17.617
See, this is what
friends are for.

15:19.252 --> 15:21.488
If Ruby was sick,
would you still be my friend?

15:26.326 --> 15:30.063
* Sweetheart
Would you wake up today? *

15:33.033 --> 15:37.637
* I promise you would
Recognize my face *

15:39.272 --> 15:41.141
* I wanna show you...

15:41.174 --> 15:42.275
-[beeps]
-[music stops]

15:42.309 --> 15:43.676
[synth-pop music plays]

15:47.347 --> 15:51.618
* All through the night

15:52.452 --> 15:57.324
* I'll be awake
And I'll be with you *

15:57.357 --> 16:04.131
* Oh, all through
The night today *

16:04.631 --> 16:11.338
* Knowing that we feel
The same without saying *

16:11.371 --> 16:16.609
* We have no past
We won't reach back *

16:16.643 --> 16:22.049
* Keep with me forward
All through the night *

16:22.082 --> 16:26.753
* And once we start
The meter clicks *

16:26.786 --> 16:31.658
* And it goes running
All through the night *

16:31.691 --> 16:36.629
* Until it ends
There is no end *

16:43.103 --> 16:44.171
[glass shatters]

16:44.204 --> 16:45.405
Lena?

16:46.506 --> 16:47.774
Hey.

16:47.807 --> 16:50.177
Hey, look, I made a metaphor.

16:50.210 --> 16:51.544
Are you here alone?

16:52.345 --> 16:55.715
Sam's running my company,
Ruby's at a friend's.

16:56.616 --> 16:59.386
-What news from the front?
-Nothing yet.

17:01.154 --> 17:02.622
You know,

17:02.655 --> 17:05.158
you're terrible
at hiding things from me.

17:05.192 --> 17:08.095
[scoffs] I wouldn't be
so sure of that.

17:08.128 --> 17:09.028
[glass shards rattle]

17:10.097 --> 17:13.366
[sighs] I came to let you know
that I'm not done.

17:13.400 --> 17:14.801
Not by a long shot.

17:14.834 --> 17:18.605
Until we know for sure,
I will turn over every rock,
and--

17:18.638 --> 17:20.540
Just stop.

17:23.776 --> 17:26.646
You are one
of the strongest women I know,

17:26.679 --> 17:28.081
why aren't you fighting?

17:28.115 --> 17:29.582
Because I did it.

17:30.150 --> 17:32.185
Kara, I did it.

17:32.552 --> 17:34.487
You know, all I ever wanted
to be was good.

17:36.656 --> 17:38.591
My whole life I was a pariah.

17:39.726 --> 17:42.129
First, because I was rich,

17:42.162 --> 17:45.165
and because
of my brother, so...

17:46.766 --> 17:49.236
And then, finally I did

17:49.269 --> 17:52.105
just... just one thing,
one thing that was good,

17:52.139 --> 17:56.176
and now I'm the monster
that poisons children.
[chuckles]

17:57.477 --> 17:59.512
You know,
even Lex Luthor never did that.

17:59.546 --> 18:01.848
Anyone who knows you
knows that you would never...

18:01.881 --> 18:04.484
Maybe I'm the same.
People are sick.

18:05.485 --> 18:07.086
It's my fault.

18:07.620 --> 18:10.223
There's still a chance
it wasn't you.

18:10.257 --> 18:13.493
I know you believe
that everything is good,

18:13.526 --> 18:15.628
and kind, and that

18:15.662 --> 18:18.431
is one of the things
I love about you.

18:19.832 --> 18:21.134
But that's not the real world.

18:23.170 --> 18:26.606
In the real world,
my last name is bin Laden

18:26.639 --> 18:28.441
and everything I do
hurts people.

18:30.643 --> 18:33.813
Hey, you know, it's...
it's in my DNA, okay?

18:33.846 --> 18:37.517
So, please, just... just...
just stop.

18:38.185 --> 18:39.552
Stop believing me, okay?

18:40.753 --> 18:43.823
I am not worth it.

18:52.965 --> 18:54.201
Hey.

18:54.234 --> 18:56.169
-Hey.
-Thanks for staying.

18:56.203 --> 18:58.738
Yeah.
She didn't want me to, but...

18:59.672 --> 19:03.176
You know, I've known Lena
a long time and I've never
seen her like this.

19:03.910 --> 19:06.579
She wants everyone
to think she's so tough.

19:06.613 --> 19:09.249
-Yeah, but she is mush
on the inside.
-[chuckles]

19:10.617 --> 19:13.853
Hey, uh, if you wanna go home,
I can sit with her.

19:13.886 --> 19:17.257
No, it's totally fine.
I've actually been having
trouble sleeping, so...

19:17.290 --> 19:21.461
-Me, too. Bad dreams.
-Yeah, I got those, too.

19:21.494 --> 19:22.929
Okay, what's this?

19:23.563 --> 19:26.866
I've just been trying
to skim through public records

19:26.899 --> 19:29.369
to get info
on the families affected.

19:29.402 --> 19:30.603
I've been doing the same thing.

19:30.637 --> 19:32.672
Um, the medical team at L-Corp

19:32.705 --> 19:35.342
was able to secure
the addresses for
all the sick children.

19:35.375 --> 19:37.277
So what happens
when you connect the Xs?

19:37.310 --> 19:38.778
Nothing. The movies lie.

19:39.546 --> 19:41.948
Usually, when something
like this happens,

19:41.981 --> 19:43.816
those affected
are from a specific area,

19:43.850 --> 19:46.553
but these kids
are from all over the city.

19:46.586 --> 19:49.289
Luke, who I saw
this morning at Ruby's school,

19:49.322 --> 19:51.491
he lives down the street.
But then there are two kids

19:51.524 --> 19:54.761
who live across the city
and go to Burgon Country Day.

19:54.794 --> 19:57.697
And then there's another one
who lives all the way
in Edgemont.

19:57.730 --> 20:00.967
I just... Staring at this,
trying to make sense of it.

20:02.935 --> 20:05.738
There's gotta be some way
these kids are connected.

20:07.540 --> 20:10.510
Social media, school records,
bank statements,

20:10.543 --> 20:11.744
maybe there's a link?

20:12.579 --> 20:14.347
Bank statements.
Let's follow the money.

20:14.381 --> 20:16.249
Yes. I'll make a call.

20:16.283 --> 20:18.251
You don't have to. I'm on it.

20:19.552 --> 20:20.553
[Kara] How did you...

20:22.755 --> 20:23.990
[chuckles]

20:24.023 --> 20:25.958
I can see why Lena likes you.

20:29.296 --> 20:31.298
-[Sam] Hmm.
-Delaney's Dumpling Truck.

20:31.998 --> 20:33.666
Food truck? What about it?

20:34.401 --> 20:37.637
Well, Luke's dad and another
mom went there on the same day

20:37.670 --> 20:40.373
a couple of weeks ago,
October 21st.

20:40.407 --> 20:42.909
Maybe... maybe
it's just coincidence.

20:42.942 --> 20:44.977
No. Hold on.

20:47.046 --> 20:48.815
They were all there.

20:48.848 --> 20:50.317
Could it be something
in the food?

20:53.720 --> 20:55.722
Oktoberfest at Frances Park.

20:57.056 --> 20:58.658
Could be something there.

21:02.028 --> 21:03.396
[pants]

21:04.964 --> 21:05.965
[sighs]

21:09.736 --> 21:11.804
-What are we doing?
-[chuckles softly]

21:14.006 --> 21:16.309
-I know, that was crazy.
-[both laugh]

21:19.379 --> 21:21.448
No, I mean, what are we doing?

21:23.783 --> 21:25.818
Are you sure
you wanna give up on this?

21:27.053 --> 21:28.421
You sure you wanna do this?

21:28.455 --> 21:31.391
Give up on something
tangible and real...

21:31.424 --> 21:33.326
us, it's us...

21:34.694 --> 21:37.930
for some notion
you have of being a mom?

21:41.434 --> 21:42.902
It's not some notion.

21:48.475 --> 21:50.410
Ever since I was little...

21:55.415 --> 21:59.419
when I would see a mom
and her kids...

22:00.853 --> 22:02.822
this thing would happen to me.

22:04.123 --> 22:06.693
You know, it's... It's...

22:06.726 --> 22:09.462
recognition that
I was gonna be a mom, too.

22:10.797 --> 22:14.434
And it wasn't some,
you know, I...

22:14.467 --> 22:16.903
"Oh, I... I want it.
I want that,"

22:16.936 --> 22:19.406
or "I hope someday
that I have that."

22:20.840 --> 22:22.341
No, it's just...

22:23.142 --> 22:26.913
something that
I've always known.

22:29.416 --> 22:30.950
Even when everything else,

22:30.983 --> 22:33.653
whether it was boyfriend,
girlfriend, whatever,

22:33.686 --> 22:37.023
when... when that was blurry...

22:41.961 --> 22:44.897
the part of me being a mom,

22:44.931 --> 22:47.366
that's always been
crystal clear.

22:51.438 --> 22:53.473
If I deny that...

22:56.976 --> 22:58.445
I'm gonna feel it forever.

23:05.985 --> 23:07.854
I wish I could change
the way I feel.

23:09.021 --> 23:10.990
Yeah. Me, too.

23:20.467 --> 23:22.469
So many vendors and rides here,

23:22.502 --> 23:25.171
it could have been anything.
For all we know, it's gone.

23:25.204 --> 23:27.440
Unless it wasn't
something outside.

23:28.207 --> 23:30.477
-It's locked.
-Huh.

23:35.214 --> 23:37.484
It was a sticky hinge.

23:40.953 --> 23:43.890
Eliza used to bring me
to a place like this.

23:43.923 --> 23:45.458
Who's Eliza?

23:45.492 --> 23:47.560
My adoptive mom.

23:48.127 --> 23:50.029
Every Tuesday and Thursday.

23:50.830 --> 23:53.232
-You're adopted? So am I.
-[chuckles] Really?

23:53.265 --> 23:56.102
Except for my place
was Mondays and Wednesdays.

23:57.970 --> 23:59.972
Gosh, we really loved swimming.

24:02.542 --> 24:04.511
Every kid loves swimming.

24:08.214 --> 24:09.549
I'm gonna test the pool.

24:10.850 --> 24:11.918
You're gonna test it?

24:11.951 --> 24:15.121
I have a friend at the FBI
who helps me on stories.

24:16.122 --> 24:18.591
Tests stuff, lab work.

24:19.091 --> 24:20.459
That's a good friend to have.

24:22.795 --> 24:24.497
-Winn?
-Yo, what is going on?

24:24.531 --> 24:26.899
I'm gonna send you
a water sample from
a public pool.

24:26.933 --> 24:28.234
[Winn chuckles] Really?

24:28.267 --> 24:31.504
You know what, when I made
that device, J'onn tried
to tell me

24:31.538 --> 24:33.973
that no one was ever gonna
use it and I said to him,
I said,

24:34.006 --> 24:37.276
"J'onn, one day, someone's
gonna need to take a sample
on the go."

24:37.309 --> 24:38.878
Here we... Oh, we got it.

24:39.612 --> 24:40.847
-Is it lead?
-Oh, my God.

24:40.880 --> 24:42.214
What?

24:42.248 --> 24:45.117
Um, this is an advanced
hydromorphic carbon
nitrate compound.

24:45.151 --> 24:46.853
-What does that mean?
-It's a synthetic compound

24:46.886 --> 24:48.788
that, when combined with water,

24:48.821 --> 24:51.524
exhibits the exact
same properties as,

24:51.558 --> 24:54.794
you guessed it, lead,
and if someone's exposed to it,

24:54.827 --> 24:56.563
the exact same symptoms
as lead poisoning.

24:57.029 --> 24:58.831
So, it wasn't the lead bomb.

24:58.865 --> 25:00.967
No. No, it wasn't.

25:01.701 --> 25:04.103
[sighs] Thank you.

25:05.271 --> 25:08.608
It wasn't Lena.
Someone put a dangerous
chemical compound in the pool.

25:09.709 --> 25:11.544
-How?
-I...

25:14.013 --> 25:15.014
Come with me.

25:28.761 --> 25:30.597
[cell phone ringing]

25:35.702 --> 25:37.203
-Hello?
-Lena?

25:37.236 --> 25:41.173
Sam and I are at this pool
and all the kids who got sick
have been here.,

25:41.207 --> 25:43.309
-I thought I told you to stop.
-It wasn't you.

25:47.079 --> 25:48.080
What?

25:48.781 --> 25:50.650
There's a synthetic chemical,

25:50.683 --> 25:53.319
when it touches water
it becomes toxic to the body.

25:53.352 --> 25:56.322
It mimics the same symptoms
as lead poisoning.

25:56.355 --> 25:58.190
Well, how... how did it get
in the swimming pool?

25:58.224 --> 25:59.592
It's in
the chlorine containers.

25:59.626 --> 26:01.661
They've been using it
instead of chlorine.

26:02.061 --> 26:05.965
Sam and I are gonna try
to track down the manufacturer.
Acre Lee Chemical.

26:07.634 --> 26:09.301
-Acre Lee Chemical?
-Yeah, you know it?

26:10.102 --> 26:12.104
No. No.

26:14.040 --> 26:15.975
Thank you, both of you.

26:23.816 --> 26:24.617
[door opens]

26:26.653 --> 26:27.920
Lena.

26:29.155 --> 26:30.690
You look horrible.

26:31.991 --> 26:34.627
Those sick kids really got you
tied up in a knot, huh?

26:34.661 --> 26:37.096
-Acre Lee.
-Acre what?

26:39.198 --> 26:42.368
Acre Lee. Acre Lee,
that's where the coyote

26:42.401 --> 26:45.137
gets all the stuff that
he's gonna use to kill
the roadrunner from, right?

26:45.171 --> 26:46.372
It's a company you own.

26:47.874 --> 26:50.777
I remembered it from
due diligence before I invested
in your buildings.

26:51.377 --> 26:55.648
Established in 1982,
manufactures hydrogen gas
and sodium hydroxide

26:55.682 --> 26:58.785
and also simple chlorine
used for swimming pools.

26:59.686 --> 27:01.688
Acquired by Edge Global
seven years ago.

27:02.354 --> 27:06.693
[stammers] I'd have to check
my records, you know.

27:06.726 --> 27:09.261
You used it to poison kids
in swimming pools

27:09.295 --> 27:11.197
in order to drag
my name through the mud.

27:12.398 --> 27:13.966
[chuckles] Come on.

27:15.234 --> 27:17.670
That's it? That's what you're
bringing? That's what you got?

27:17.704 --> 27:19.672
I say you did it,
you say I did it?

27:21.107 --> 27:22.675
I expected better out of you.

27:27.446 --> 27:29.749
[inhales sharply]
Now that's a disappointment.

27:29.782 --> 27:33.052
When that mom shot at me,
I knew she was doing
the right thing.

27:33.786 --> 27:36.288
Because whoever
was responsible for this,

27:36.322 --> 27:37.724
they deserve to die.

27:38.858 --> 27:41.227
No trial, no jury.

27:42.194 --> 27:43.830
Just erased from the world.

27:44.997 --> 27:46.699
You need help, Lena,

27:46.733 --> 27:49.268
'cause you're not...
you're not thinking clearly.

27:49.736 --> 27:51.437
I'm thinking like a Luthor.

27:54.273 --> 27:55.674
[grunts]

28:00.012 --> 28:01.013
[gasps]

28:02.281 --> 28:03.382
[rattling]

28:05.051 --> 28:06.085
Hello?

28:08.520 --> 28:09.756
Hello?

28:17.463 --> 28:18.765
[engine whirring]

28:59.471 --> 29:01.407
That's right, Lena,

29:01.440 --> 29:03.810
who the heck is flying
this plane?

29:05.577 --> 29:08.114
We never turned
the "fasten seat belts"
sign off, did we?

29:08.147 --> 29:09.949
Give her a little turbulence.

29:09.982 --> 29:11.117
Yes, sir.

29:12.184 --> 29:13.519
[turbulence]

29:17.824 --> 29:19.892
Mayday, Mayday,
this is Lena Luthor.

29:19.926 --> 29:20.927
Jam the transmission.

29:22.161 --> 29:23.930
I'm in a cargo plane
headed directly
to the reservoir.

29:23.963 --> 29:25.497
They're gonna
dump chemicals in the water.

29:25.531 --> 29:29.802
Sir, receiving word that
there's an unidentified
aircraft in our airspace.

29:29.836 --> 29:31.838
-Alien?
-No, it's a C-130 cargo plane.

29:31.871 --> 29:33.172
Not on the FAA fly list.

29:33.873 --> 29:34.874
Did you contact the Air Force?

29:34.907 --> 29:36.943
Not yet, sir.
But we have a message fragment.

29:36.976 --> 29:38.911
-Distress call.
-What distress call?

29:39.879 --> 29:41.180
[Demos] I'm pulling it up.

29:41.213 --> 29:42.815
-[Lena] Mayday, Mayday,
this is...
-[static crackling]

29:42.849 --> 29:44.550
Mayday, Mayday, this is...

29:45.084 --> 29:46.552
It's Lena.

29:49.856 --> 29:51.023
[Morgan]
Initiate release sequence.

29:56.863 --> 29:57.897
Bring the plane up
three degrees.

30:06.505 --> 30:08.841
Release isn't working.
I can't dump the payload.

30:21.888 --> 30:24.090
-She's closed the ramp.
-Only one thing left to do.

30:25.124 --> 30:26.893
-Crash the plane.
-Are you sure?

30:26.926 --> 30:27.894
Crash the plane!

30:35.034 --> 30:36.936
The barrels are treated
to dissolve in water.

30:36.969 --> 30:39.005
If the plane crashes,
they'll poison everyone.

30:44.576 --> 30:45.912
Strap in!

30:49.015 --> 30:50.016
[grunting]

30:54.120 --> 30:55.888
-[beeping]
-It's not going down.

30:55.922 --> 30:58.925
Oh... Yes, it will.
Get up, get up, get up, get up.

30:59.926 --> 31:01.860
I'm gonna get them
to blow the engines!

31:08.267 --> 31:09.936
[beeping]

31:23.682 --> 31:24.984
[Lena screaming]

31:38.965 --> 31:40.066
I can't hold both!

31:40.632 --> 31:43.135
Save the chemicals! Not me.

31:43.169 --> 31:45.537
No, I'm not gonna drop you!

31:45.571 --> 31:47.306
-Let me go.
-No!

31:48.007 --> 31:49.108
[grunting and straining]

31:54.346 --> 31:57.016
Climb, Lena. Climb!

32:07.994 --> 32:10.062
You can do it! Come on!
[straining]

32:11.998 --> 32:15.367
Come on!
Come on, you can do it!

32:18.137 --> 32:20.039
You have to jump, now!

32:42.694 --> 32:43.729
[beeping]

32:43.762 --> 32:45.131
What do we do?

32:46.798 --> 32:50.169
Well, you shoot the console.

32:57.243 --> 33:01.013
-What was that for?
-Just needed a little
gunshot residue

33:01.047 --> 33:02.048
on your hands.

33:03.182 --> 33:04.183
No.

33:12.424 --> 33:14.060
[car lock chirps]

33:29.141 --> 33:32.744
[Supergirl] Poisoning
innocent children for your
vendetta against Lena Luthor?

33:34.080 --> 33:36.415
It's even lower
than I expected of you, Edge.

33:36.815 --> 33:39.651
You know, I sold
Acre Lee Chemical
over two years ago.

33:39.685 --> 33:42.521
-Convenient.
-Besides, I heard
they found the guy.

33:42.554 --> 33:46.058
Yeah, he was some crazed,
lone wolf, former Marine,

33:46.092 --> 33:49.695
Air Force, he had
a bone to pick with her family.

33:51.430 --> 33:52.831
It's too bad he killed himself,

33:52.864 --> 33:54.433
'cause we could have
brought him to justice.

33:55.267 --> 33:56.468
Hmm.

33:57.169 --> 33:59.505
-Too bad.
-You know, I was thinking...

34:00.406 --> 34:02.774
he must have really hated her.

34:05.577 --> 34:07.446
Do you ever wonder
what that feels like?

34:08.514 --> 34:10.582
That kinda hate.

34:12.418 --> 34:14.120
Because I don't think
you're capable of it.

34:14.720 --> 34:17.389
You have no idea
what I am capable of.

34:18.590 --> 34:20.192
Is this about me now?

34:21.860 --> 34:25.264
Because when you got mad at me,
you dumped me on a cargo ship

34:25.297 --> 34:26.732
in the middle of the sea.

34:28.567 --> 34:31.170
What a hassle.
It cost me a few hours.

34:31.203 --> 34:33.105
Thirty bucks in dry cleaning.

34:33.139 --> 34:35.407
I don't know what kind
of hippy-dippy justice

34:35.441 --> 34:38.244
you practiced on your planet,
sweetheart,

34:38.277 --> 34:40.078
but this is the real world.

34:40.879 --> 34:42.514
It's dog-eat-dog out here.

34:43.749 --> 34:46.785
Now, if I had an enemy,

34:46.818 --> 34:49.521
I'd crush her without mercy.

34:51.157 --> 34:54.493
Let's say, for instance,
I was your enemy, hmm?

34:55.161 --> 34:57.863
The thing for you to do
right now would be to kill me.

35:03.635 --> 35:07.639
But you capes, you don't have
what it takes.

35:07.673 --> 35:08.674
Do you?

35:12.211 --> 35:14.713
Yeah. I didn't think so.

35:17.916 --> 35:19.485
You can leave the way
you came in.

35:21.220 --> 35:23.522
I think the cleaning crew
enjoyed the show.

35:36.935 --> 35:39.505
Mr. Olsen,
I didn't expect you to be here.

35:40.739 --> 35:42.140
Well, the news never sleeps.

35:42.508 --> 35:43.509
How are you, really?

35:44.710 --> 35:46.278
I was worried about you.

35:47.713 --> 35:50.549
Well, I'm kind of a hard man
to keep down, Ms. Luthor.

35:51.983 --> 35:53.352
You know, I have a rule.

35:53.385 --> 35:56.322
Whenever anyone takes
a bullet for me,
they get to call me Lena.

35:56.355 --> 35:57.689
[chuckles]

35:58.857 --> 36:01.660
Okay, well, Lena it is.

36:02.694 --> 36:04.730
And, uh,
my friends call me James.

36:04.763 --> 36:06.865
Or Jimmy.

36:06.898 --> 36:08.600
Well, feel better, Jimmy Olsen.

36:17.409 --> 36:18.510
[breathes deeply]

36:23.515 --> 36:24.850
That's everything.

36:27.286 --> 36:28.720
You sure you have
a place to stay?

36:29.555 --> 36:32.258
Yeah, I have a friend
who's letting me crash.

36:32.291 --> 36:34.693
Good. That's good.

36:43.869 --> 36:45.604
You know, I didn't, uh...

36:47.273 --> 36:49.975
I didn't know
I had it in me to be happy.

36:52.578 --> 36:54.646
Or to be accepting of myself.

36:58.984 --> 37:01.287
I never would
have gotten... [sobs]

37:02.288 --> 37:04.323
I never would have
gotten here without you.

37:10.028 --> 37:12.264
You made me deal
with my own stuff.

37:12.298 --> 37:13.965
Confronted my past.

37:13.999 --> 37:16.635
Stopped covering up the things
I didn't wanna look at.

37:18.837 --> 37:21.239
[voice breaking] I'm strong...
I'm stronger for it, you know.

37:22.674 --> 37:24.310
I'm really grateful, thank you.
[sniffles]

37:29.315 --> 37:31.317
-Can I?
-Yeah, you can.

37:55.641 --> 37:56.942
See you around, Danvers.

37:58.810 --> 38:00.346
Yeah, see you, Maggs.

38:03.482 --> 38:04.282
[sniffles]

38:09.355 --> 38:11.323
You're gonna be a great mom.

38:15.894 --> 38:17.028
[door closes]

38:18.530 --> 38:19.331
[sighs]

38:29.375 --> 38:30.809
[sobbing]

38:36.848 --> 38:39.418
-Thank you.
-[Sam] Good news.

38:40.719 --> 38:43.021
The antidote
L-Corp synthesized is working,

38:43.054 --> 38:45.424
-the kids are getting better.
-[sighs]

38:45.457 --> 38:46.958
Thank God.

38:46.992 --> 38:48.460
-[Sam] Thank you.
-[sighs]

38:49.761 --> 38:52.398
You guys, I need to say
thank you for
not giving up on me

38:52.431 --> 38:54.099
and not letting me give up
on myself.

38:54.132 --> 38:57.403
Well, I think Kara and I
made a pretty good team.

38:57.436 --> 39:01.773
Uh, more than pretty good,
if I do say so myself.

39:01.807 --> 39:03.442
[laughs]

39:03.475 --> 39:06.645
I... I probably also should
apologize to you, I mean...

39:06.678 --> 39:09.415
-I'm lucky you're still
speaking to me.
-[Kara] Hey.

39:09.848 --> 39:12.117
When you're family,
you can say what
you need to say

39:12.150 --> 39:14.386
and the people that love you
still will love you.

39:14.420 --> 39:15.721
That's right.

39:15.754 --> 39:17.989
I've never had anyone
like that in my life.

39:18.023 --> 39:19.925
That's because
you've never had a sister.

39:19.958 --> 39:21.393
[chuckles]

39:21.427 --> 39:24.095
-Two. Two sisters.
-Aw!

39:24.129 --> 39:25.997
-Aw!
-Aw, it's too much.

39:26.031 --> 39:27.098
[all chuckling]

39:27.132 --> 39:29.034
-[cell phone ringing]
-Oh, hang on.

39:32.871 --> 39:33.972
Alex?

39:40.479 --> 39:41.980
[music playing]

39:44.916 --> 39:46.384
[Alex sighs]

39:49.187 --> 39:51.990
You remember when
you said that, uh...

39:52.023 --> 39:56.895
if I lost Maggie, that I would
be at a bar drinking?

39:58.129 --> 39:59.465
That I would be broken?

40:02.534 --> 40:04.936
Score one for the girl
from Krypton.

40:12.243 --> 40:13.445
[kisses]

40:23.755 --> 40:25.090
J'onn, this is Kara.

40:25.123 --> 40:26.892
You're gonna have to get by
at the DEO

40:26.925 --> 40:28.794
without Alex and I
for a couple of days.

40:29.828 --> 40:30.829
Yeah.

40:33.098 --> 40:36.468
We are going back to your place
and you're gonna pack a bag.

40:37.869 --> 40:39.104
Where are we going?

40:39.938 --> 40:41.139
We're going home.

40:47.513 --> 40:49.214
Luke's gonna be okay?

40:49.247 --> 40:51.216
Yeah, baby, he's gonna be okay.

40:52.150 --> 40:53.585
I really like your friends.

40:54.119 --> 40:55.521
You know what?

40:56.187 --> 40:57.623
I like 'em, too.

40:57.889 --> 40:59.457
But I like you more.

41:00.992 --> 41:02.193
There's a hole in your shirt.

41:05.564 --> 41:06.532
That's weird.

41:08.534 --> 41:10.235
-I love you.
-Love you.

41:53.612 --> 41:55.614
[theme music playing]
