WEBVTT

00:03.154 --> 00:05.255
Justin Russo for Student Body President.

00:05.290 --> 00:06.957
Justin Russo.

00:06.991 --> 00:10.060
And remember, Justin's "Just-in time!"

00:10.094 --> 00:12.229
You see what I did there.
That's a compound word.

00:12.263 --> 00:13.797
Yes.

00:13.831 --> 00:16.900
I can't believe we're
running against each other.

00:16.935 --> 00:20.103
Zeke for president. Zeke the "Beek-erman"!

00:21.573 --> 00:25.475
Ah, it's time I stood up
and became my own man.

00:25.510 --> 00:28.145
But if you give me a good reason,
I may vote for you.

00:31.983 --> 00:35.619
It's a chicken dress.
A goose dress would just be stupid.

00:37.956 --> 00:40.157
Vote for me for Speaker of the Assembly.

00:40.191 --> 00:44.127
Speaker of the Assembly?
Why do you want to run for that?

00:44.162 --> 00:47.431
Because all I have to do
is introduce the assembly,

00:47.465 --> 00:49.967
and I have the rest of the
time to just do whatever I want

00:50.001 --> 00:51.668
and pull pranks around the school.

00:51.703 --> 00:54.638
Alex, aren't you tired of
pulling all these pranks?

00:54.672 --> 00:56.907
I mean, come on,
dodge balls filled with jelly?

00:56.941 --> 00:58.508
That was a good one.

01:04.816 --> 01:07.651
Good enough to land you...

01:07.685 --> 01:11.054
...in Saturday detention.

01:14.592 --> 01:17.628
Just 'cause you're frozen,
doesn't mean you're not here.

01:20.098 --> 01:22.032
<i>?T× Well, you know everything's gonna be a
breeze ?T×</i>

01:22.066 --> 01:24.134
<i>?T× That the end will no doubt justify the
means ?T×</i>

01:24.168 --> 01:26.303
<i>?T× You can fix any problem with
the slightest of ease ?T×</i>

01:26.337 --> 01:27.738
<i>?T× Yes, please ?T×</i>

01:27.772 --> 01:29.640
<i>?T× But you might find out it'll go to your
head ?T×</i>

01:29.674 --> 01:31.775
<i>?T× When you write a report on a
book you never read ?T×</i>

01:31.809 --> 01:34.444
<i>?T× With the snap of your fingers
you can make your bed ?T×</i>

01:34.479 --> 01:35.912
<i>?T× That's what I said ?T×</i>

01:35.947 --> 01:39.082
<i>?T× Everything is not
what it seems ?T×</i>

01:39.117 --> 01:43.086
<i>?T× When you can get all you wanted in your
wildest dreams ?T×</i>

01:43.121 --> 01:46.723
<i>?T× You might run into trouble if you go to
extremes ?T×</i>

01:46.758 --> 01:51.294
<i>?T× Because everything is not what it seems
?T×</i>

01:51.329 --> 01:54.364
<i>?T× Everything is not
what it seems ?T×</i>

01:54.399 --> 01:58.769
<i>?T× When you can have what you want by the
simplest of means ?T×</i>

01:58.803 --> 02:02.072
<i>?T× Be careful not to mess with the balance
of things ?T×</i>

02:02.106 --> 02:05.308
<i>?T× Because everything is not ?T×</i>

02:06.477 --> 02:08.445
<i>?T× What it seems ?T×</i>

02:10.448 --> 02:13.483
OK, peoplele of the kitchen
perimeter, let's go.

02:13.518 --> 02:17.587
Alex has detention today, so we can go to
all the places where she's been banned.

02:17.622 --> 02:19.556
Where is she not allowed to go?

02:19.590 --> 02:21.958
Coney Island, Ellis Island,
and Roosevelt Island.

02:21.993 --> 02:25.162
Alex thinks if you're on an
island there are no rules.

02:25.196 --> 02:27.831
But she lives on Manhattan Island.

02:28.833 --> 02:34.171
Doesn't that explain a lot?

02:42.747 --> 02:45.382
Mr. Laritate, in your casual weekend wear.

02:45.416 --> 02:46.616
What are you doing here?

02:47.685 --> 02:50.587
I'm here to take Mr. Russo to detention.

02:50.621 --> 02:53.390
- All right.
- No.

02:53.424 --> 02:54.391
Justin.

02:54.425 --> 02:55.759
- Excuse me?
- What?

02:55.793 --> 02:57.794
I'm as surprised as anybody.

02:57.829 --> 03:03.100
But you know the giddy-up, and g
o-go world of politics can change people.

03:03.134 --> 03:04.668
You're coming with me.

03:04.702 --> 03:06.670
But I didn't do anything.

03:06.704 --> 03:08.071
Tell it to the judge.

03:08.106 --> 03:09.172
But you are the judge.

03:09.207 --> 03:10.941
In that case, I don't want to hear it.

03:16.247 --> 03:18.749
Eddie, how many hours ahead? Two or four?

03:24.388 --> 03:30.460
Oh, Mr. Laritate.

03:30.495 --> 03:32.529
I was just fixing the time, cause...

03:32.563 --> 03:35.298
Who has the right time? Because this is...

03:35.333 --> 03:37.467
This is all wrong.

03:38.903 --> 03:40.403
Mr. Laritate, what did I do?

03:40.438 --> 03:42.572
You can't leave me in a
room full of these people.

03:42.607 --> 03:44.441
I hear they can smell fear.

03:44.475 --> 03:45.542
And right now...

03:45.576 --> 03:47.544
...I'm stinking of it.

03:48.880 --> 03:51.314
Nah, that smell was in here already.

03:52.884 --> 03:54.518
What are you doing here?

03:54.552 --> 03:57.654
Did the teachers finally get annoyed
by you turning in your homework early?

03:59.000 --> 04:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:08.900 --> 04:12.435
You're doing my math homework.

04:12.470 --> 04:14.704
Oh, and you smell like fear.

04:15.973 --> 04:18.241
Mr. Laritate, you gotta get me out of here.

04:18.276 --> 04:19.942
I'm sorry, son.

04:19.976 --> 04:22.512
But somebody has vandalized my office.

04:22.547 --> 04:26.650
And every clue's got your face all over it.

04:28.853 --> 04:34.591
Wagons, ho! Hey.

04:34.625 --> 04:36.893
I've seen this idiot around school.

04:38.996 --> 04:40.864
That's me.

04:40.898 --> 04:44.201
Shut up. I'm trying to figure
out where I've seen this guy.

04:46.938 --> 04:48.471
Mr. Laritate,

04:48.506 --> 04:51.241
I never defend my brother
in anything, trust me,

04:51.275 --> 04:53.109
but this is a pranking masterpiece.

04:53.144 --> 04:55.145
There's no way that he could have done this.

04:55.179 --> 04:57.280
Are you saying it was you?

04:57.315 --> 05:00.116
Maybe it was you.

05:00.151 --> 05:02.385
He is your favorite student.

05:04.288 --> 05:05.755
All right everybody.

05:05.790 --> 05:06.823
Take your seats.

05:08.292 --> 05:10.093
Detention begins...

05:11.295 --> 05:12.229
Now.

05:17.535 --> 05:20.136
Hello, prisoners.

05:20.171 --> 05:21.204
Warden.

05:23.307 --> 05:24.875
Sorry I'm late.

05:24.909 --> 05:26.309
I had a phone call,

05:26.344 --> 05:27.911
with your mom.

05:27.945 --> 05:30.146
She said, "Get out of my chair."

05:37.655 --> 05:38.955
Who are you?

05:38.990 --> 05:40.490
I'm Stevie.

05:40.524 --> 05:41.892
Last name...

05:41.926 --> 05:44.694
I don't want to know yours,
so why do you want to know mine?

05:46.430 --> 05:48.899
She makes you look like him.

05:50.468 --> 05:51.534
All right.

05:52.803 --> 05:57.140
I'll be back to let you
out of the cage at 3.

05:57.174 --> 05:58.541
If you need anything,

05:58.576 --> 06:00.911
you should have thought of
that before you acted up.

06:07.051 --> 06:08.518
Hey, Stevie.

06:08.552 --> 06:10.220
Why don't you tell me a bedtime story

06:10.254 --> 06:12.522
about how you ended up in detention so fast?

06:12.556 --> 06:15.625
I got caught for some
stuff at my old school,

06:15.660 --> 06:17.594
so they're making me make up detention here.

06:17.628 --> 06:19.262
But, it's cool.

06:19.297 --> 06:21.631
It's the quickest way to meet my people.

06:24.635 --> 06:26.603
Your people?

06:26.637 --> 06:29.639
Oh, you mean, like me.
Aw! Thank you. That's so sweet.

06:31.342 --> 06:32.943
Now,

06:32.977 --> 06:34.844
if you'll excuse me...

06:36.580 --> 06:38.915
I need a couple more hours shut eye

06:38.950 --> 06:40.917
under a gentle rain. -

06:45.156 --> 06:46.723
You're gonna have to turn that down.

06:46.757 --> 06:48.558
<i>It makes me gotta go numero uno.</i>

06:50.294 --> 06:52.963
Yeah, that's right, I speak French.

06:57.368 --> 06:59.135
- -
- Well...

06:59.170 --> 07:00.670
Wee, wee.

07:15.786 --> 07:17.320
-

07:17.355 --> 07:18.321
Oh, no!

07:18.356 --> 07:20.890
It stopped. Nobody panic.

07:20.925 --> 07:22.225
No way. I love to panic.

07:23.761 --> 07:25.462
Relax. It's OK.

07:25.496 --> 07:28.832
I'm sure it has nothing to do with the
fact that we've overloaded this cart.

07:29.900 --> 07:32.702
Ah, they're gonna fix it soon.

07:32.737 --> 07:34.204
Let's just, uh...

07:34.238 --> 07:35.805
take in the view,

07:35.840 --> 07:38.375
and enjoy this beautiful day while it lasts.

07:42.413 --> 07:45.415
Well, that didn't last long.

07:45.449 --> 07:46.850
Man, it's freezing.

07:46.884 --> 07:51.054
This is why I can't wait to
get hair all over my body.

07:51.088 --> 07:52.589
Don't worry.

07:52.623 --> 07:55.058
Who wants the strawberry patch sweater?

07:55.092 --> 07:57.427
And who wants the butterfly scarf?

07:57.461 --> 07:59.829
Can I please use my wand
to get us out of here?

07:59.864 --> 08:02.332
- Go for it, son.
- Thank you so much.

08:06.237 --> 08:07.170
OK.

08:07.204 --> 08:09.739
- Whoa! No!
- Oh!

08:09.774 --> 08:12.909
That happened a lot quicker
than I thought it would.

08:14.378 --> 08:16.646
I'll take the butterfly scarf.

08:26.223 --> 08:27.190
Morning.

08:27.224 --> 08:29.225
Oh! Gosh.

08:32.163 --> 08:33.296
So, loser.

08:34.331 --> 08:35.932
You're the one that pulled this prank?

08:35.966 --> 08:37.933
It wasn't me.

08:38.469 --> 08:40.236
Relax, dork.

08:41.371 --> 08:43.139
I think it's cool.

08:44.075 --> 08:45.208
Then...

08:45.242 --> 08:47.043
...yes.

08:47.078 --> 08:49.045
This was all me. Mm-hm.

08:50.915 --> 08:53.349
Are you guys gonna vote for me
for Speaker of the Assembly?

08:53.384 --> 08:54.951
Yeah, uh...

08:54.985 --> 08:56.519
We don't vote.

08:56.554 --> 08:58.922
Because you can't read.

08:58.956 --> 09:00.256
You know,

09:00.291 --> 09:04.994
there's a difference between
being bad and being stupid.

09:05.029 --> 09:07.030
Well, if I was gonna vote

09:07.064 --> 09:08.998
I'd vote for the one
that pulled all this off.

09:09.033 --> 09:10.700
- -
- My man right here.

09:14.872 --> 09:16.506
You?

09:19.376 --> 09:20.677
You didn't do this prank.

09:20.711 --> 09:24.414
I'll admit to robbing a bank
if it gets me out of here.

09:24.448 --> 09:26.816
But pranking is my campaign promise.

09:26.851 --> 09:28.685
I can't let you take credit for this.

09:28.719 --> 09:30.253
I'm gonna find out who really did this,

09:30.287 --> 09:32.055
so they can help me with my campaign.

09:32.089 --> 09:35.558
They have to have left some
clues here or something.

09:35.593 --> 09:38.061
I'm not leaving here until
I figure out who did this.

09:38.095 --> 09:40.296
- - All right, everybody.

09:40.331 --> 09:42.699
- Detention's over. Get out.
- Yes!

09:42.733 --> 09:44.300
Yah!

09:52.576 --> 09:54.177
Miss Russo,

09:54.211 --> 09:56.279
even though you're frozen,

09:56.313 --> 09:58.548
I can see you.

10:02.520 --> 10:05.922
- What about now?
- Yah!

10:09.347 --> 10:10.447
Hey.

10:10.481 --> 10:14.551
Today is your lucky day.
You can hang with us.

10:14.585 --> 10:17.688
But, you're definitely gonna
have to make a few changes.

10:17.722 --> 10:20.257
Yes! I mean, yeah!

10:20.291 --> 10:22.292
Like what?

10:23.661 --> 10:26.563
For starters, we gotta lower
your pants a little bit.

10:26.597 --> 10:28.865
Why?

10:28.900 --> 10:31.702
Am I getting a shot?

10:31.736 --> 10:33.370
I'm not good with needles.

10:33.404 --> 10:35.238
No, no, no.

10:36.507 --> 10:39.076
Just wear 'em a little lower.

10:39.110 --> 10:40.410
Oh.

10:52.890 --> 10:54.224
Why are your shoes tied?

10:54.258 --> 10:56.093
Untie them.

10:56.127 --> 10:57.461
Oh, yeah.

10:57.495 --> 10:59.129
Yeah, yeah. Let's untie them.

10:59.163 --> 11:01.164
Right. Yeah.

11:10.942 --> 11:12.242
I like it.

11:12.276 --> 11:15.412
Everything's all loose,

11:15.446 --> 11:18.148
and jangly.

11:18.182 --> 11:19.149
It's relaxing.

11:19.183 --> 11:20.817
Wow.

11:23.154 --> 11:25.422
<i>What up? Nada mucho.</i>

11:31.262 --> 11:32.929
- I think you're ready.
- Yeah.

11:32.964 --> 11:35.132
To throw a rock at that nerd right there.

11:35.166 --> 11:37.000
Giant dog on water skis.

11:38.035 --> 11:40.237
Hi-larious!

11:40.271 --> 11:42.272
Zeke's my friend.

11:44.175 --> 11:45.108
Hey, Justin.

11:45.143 --> 11:47.577
Listen, I heard about what happened

11:47.612 --> 11:49.112
and I know you're innocent.

11:49.147 --> 11:50.981
Whoa, what happened to your pants, dude?

11:51.015 --> 11:52.048
Pull them up.

11:53.918 --> 11:56.119
You don't want to look like Eddie and them.

11:58.556 --> 12:01.458
Zeke. Detention has changed me.

12:01.492 --> 12:05.228
Eddie and them are my crew.

12:05.263 --> 12:07.597
I guess is what they'd say. "Crew."

12:10.067 --> 12:11.701
I don't buy it.

12:11.736 --> 12:14.504
If he's forcing you to say this blink twice.

12:16.941 --> 12:21.378
I don't think I have a chance of winning
the election now that I'm a street tough.

12:26.384 --> 12:30.053
I can't believe I lost
you to Eddie and them.

12:30.087 --> 12:31.221
Goodbye, old friend.

12:31.255 --> 12:32.455
-

12:35.359 --> 12:36.293
OK.

12:36.327 --> 12:38.428
Now, I'm going to pretend

12:38.462 --> 12:39.729
to throw a rock at you.

12:39.764 --> 12:41.698
OK. OK.

12:41.732 --> 12:44.634
- And I want you to pretend
- All right.

12:44.669 --> 12:47.370
- that it hits you.
- OK. All right.

12:48.873 --> 12:49.973
Now scram!

12:50.007 --> 12:53.610
You nerd, dork, geek, loser!

12:53.644 --> 12:55.245
Yeah.

13:03.721 --> 13:05.355
Oh, my spine!

13:05.389 --> 13:08.225
Oh, that's so painful!

13:11.629 --> 13:14.764
Dad, is this a survival situation?

13:14.799 --> 13:16.099
All right.

13:16.133 --> 13:18.335
I'm gonna slow my heart rate down

13:18.369 --> 13:21.204
and then I'm gonna go into
hibernation just like a bear.

13:27.812 --> 13:29.746
Oh! I'm starving.

13:31.415 --> 13:34.317
Does anyone smell salami and crackers?

13:34.352 --> 13:36.586
My nose is starting to hallucinate.

13:36.621 --> 13:40.790
Oh, no. That's just my
salami and cracker earrings.

13:40.825 --> 13:42.292
We're saved.

13:46.430 --> 13:47.364
Harper.

13:47.398 --> 13:48.999
Harper.

13:50.034 --> 13:52.002
I need your help. I've got to find out

13:52.036 --> 13:54.371
who pulled off one of the
best pranks I've ever seen.

13:54.405 --> 13:56.806
There's no better person to help
me win than a fellow prankster.

13:56.841 --> 13:58.108
Where have you been?

13:58.142 --> 14:00.310
I was stuck on top of the
Coney Island Ferris wheel

14:00.344 --> 14:01.778
with your dad and Max.

14:01.812 --> 14:03.747
Coney Island? We're banned from there.

14:03.781 --> 14:06.049
No. You are.

14:07.685 --> 14:11.221
Oh. So, you all went without me?

14:13.691 --> 14:14.958
Yeah.

14:14.992 --> 14:17.594
It was kind of an Alex-free day.

14:17.628 --> 14:20.597
Sorry. So, come on, do a little
of your bibbity-bobbity-boo

14:20.631 --> 14:23.800
and rescue your dad and brother. Just...

14:23.834 --> 14:25.835
Bibbity-bobbity-no!

14:26.971 --> 14:29.239
I'm gonna let them enjoy
their Alex-free day.

14:29.273 --> 14:31.975
Because I'm that nice.

14:33.411 --> 14:34.477
Freeze!

14:43.888 --> 14:45.522
Finally.

14:52.663 --> 14:54.497
Wow.

14:54.532 --> 14:56.833
Either this is a really great prank,

14:56.867 --> 15:00.503
or a new design idea for my bedroom.

15:00.538 --> 15:02.939
Harper, focus. We're looking for clues.

15:06.510 --> 15:09.579
Even the stapler is wrapped.

15:09.613 --> 15:13.950
By someone with nimble fingers
and lots of down time.

15:13.985 --> 15:15.285
That's me.

15:16.821 --> 15:18.021
It's not you, Harper.

15:20.358 --> 15:23.393
If only these posters of Justin could talk.

15:24.795 --> 15:26.129
Oh my gosh. You're right.

15:26.163 --> 15:27.964
Because all of them saw who did this.

15:27.999 --> 15:31.201
No, because I like talking to Justin.

15:31.235 --> 15:32.802
Harper.

15:35.272 --> 15:37.941
<i>Posters, posters on the wall. Now it's time
to tell us all.</i>

15:39.443 --> 15:41.578
- Hello, voters.
- Vote for Justin Russo.

15:41.612 --> 15:43.613
- My favorite colors are...
- Justin's just-in time.

15:43.647 --> 15:46.383
<i>Justin, he's the best choice!</i>

15:46.417 --> 15:48.785
OK, OK! Everybody hush up.

15:48.819 --> 15:50.186
Now,

15:50.221 --> 15:52.589
who did all of this to Mr.
Laritate's office?

15:52.623 --> 15:54.691
- -
- No!

15:54.725 --> 15:58.128
You, only you. Talk.

15:58.162 --> 16:00.030
I can't tell you.

16:00.064 --> 16:02.399
I promised her I wouldn't say.

16:02.433 --> 16:04.401
Her? It's a girl.

16:04.435 --> 16:06.069
It is a girl.

16:06.103 --> 16:08.738
With nimble fingers and lots of down time.

16:08.773 --> 16:11.274
Are you sure it's not me?

16:11.308 --> 16:13.176
Her who?

16:13.210 --> 16:16.112
I can't say, because she's gonna vote for me

16:16.147 --> 16:19.049
and every vote counts, as you know.

16:19.083 --> 16:21.584
And she's gonna vote for him. It's me.

16:23.154 --> 16:24.554
It's not you, Harper.

16:24.588 --> 16:26.356
And I'm not gonna say who it is.

16:26.390 --> 16:29.692
Because this election is too
important to my senior year.

16:29.727 --> 16:32.395
I'm done talking to you guys.

16:32.430 --> 16:34.497
<i>Posters, posters, that didn't squeal at
all.</i>

16:34.532 --> 16:38.701
<i>Zip it up. Stay on this wall.</i>

16:41.439 --> 16:43.440
I hate it when Justin cares about stuff.

16:43.474 --> 16:45.375
It gets in my way.

16:45.409 --> 16:46.443
Come on.

16:49.580 --> 16:52.782
It's 197 for Justin.

16:52.817 --> 16:55.618
One ninety-seven for Zeke.

16:55.653 --> 16:58.354
OK. So it's a girl.

16:58.389 --> 17:03.893
That narrows it down to like 207 minus
one 'cause we're pretty sure it's not me.

17:03.928 --> 17:05.694
Harper...

17:05.729 --> 17:08.364
Forget it. It's over.
People have already voted.

17:08.398 --> 17:11.468
Now, we just have to wait
to see who the winner is,

17:11.502 --> 17:13.803
plant cheat sheets in their locker,

17:13.838 --> 17:16.739
and you're looking at your
new Speaker of the Assembly.

17:16.773 --> 17:19.075
Where are we gonna get cheat sheets?

17:19.109 --> 17:20.477
Come on.

17:23.914 --> 17:26.182
Eddie and them?

17:26.217 --> 17:28.218
What are you guys doing here?
You don't vote.

17:28.252 --> 17:30.487
We did this time.

17:30.521 --> 17:33.289
Them convinced me. Them was all like,

17:33.324 --> 17:35.658
"We should vote and stuff."

17:37.328 --> 17:39.863
Justin, it looks like you're pulling ahead.

17:39.897 --> 17:41.865
Two hundred for Zeke.

17:41.899 --> 17:44.067
Two hundred and six for Justin.

17:45.302 --> 17:46.569
I'm good with it.

17:46.604 --> 17:49.005
I did some soul searching, and...

17:49.039 --> 17:50.406
I voted for you.

17:51.909 --> 17:52.976
And if I had voted,

17:53.010 --> 17:55.745
I would've voted for you too, buddy.

17:57.214 --> 17:59.616
- You didn't vote?
- Mm-mm.

17:59.650 --> 18:02.152
What kind of citizen are you?

18:02.853 --> 18:03.887
And...

18:03.921 --> 18:07.423
Justin Russo wins by a total of six votes.

18:08.692 --> 18:11.594
Mr. Laritate, I'd like to withdraw my vote.

18:12.830 --> 18:14.397
OK.

18:15.733 --> 18:18.301
Justin wins by five votes.

18:21.939 --> 18:24.607
This is amazing.
Your votes put me over the top.

18:24.642 --> 18:26.442
Thank you, Eddie and them.

18:26.477 --> 18:27.577
However,

18:27.611 --> 18:30.246
since Justin pranked my office,

18:30.281 --> 18:32.482
I'm afraid he's disqualified.

18:32.516 --> 18:33.483
What?

18:33.517 --> 18:35.852
Wait. No! No, no, no.

18:35.886 --> 18:37.887
Justin should be President. He didn't do it.

18:37.922 --> 18:39.956
If he didn't do it, who did?

18:42.226 --> 18:43.793
I did. It was all me.

18:43.827 --> 18:45.461
Alex.

18:45.496 --> 18:47.630
What are you talking about?
How did you do it?

18:47.665 --> 18:48.798
It wasn't me.

18:48.832 --> 18:50.867
I know this is important to you.

18:52.570 --> 18:55.104
- And I was on a roll here.
- You should get back up. Go.

18:57.508 --> 19:02.145
Everybody here knows that Justin
and I don't like each other.

19:02.179 --> 19:04.547
Now, that is correct.

19:05.816 --> 19:07.584
Well, then we have a confession.

19:07.618 --> 19:10.653
Justin Russo is your new
Student Body President.

19:12.923 --> 19:15.658
And Alex Russo is disqualified

19:15.693 --> 19:17.594
from running for Speaker of the Assembly.

19:18.429 --> 19:19.362
Hold on!

19:19.396 --> 19:21.231
Hold on.

19:23.033 --> 19:25.435
Everybody stop pointing your fingers at her

19:25.469 --> 19:27.604
and start pointing your fingers at me.

19:27.638 --> 19:29.005
I did it.

19:29.039 --> 19:32.809
These nimble fingers wrapped
your office in Justin's posters.

19:32.843 --> 19:34.310
Even the stapler.

19:35.746 --> 19:38.147
Looks like we have a double confession.

19:38.182 --> 19:39.182
Ooh!

19:39.216 --> 19:42.118
In the Old West, there'd be a duel.

19:42.152 --> 19:44.087
Which is why I wait with bated breath

19:44.121 --> 19:46.923
for the invention of the
time machine. Till then,

19:46.957 --> 19:50.026
new girl Stevie, Alex Russo...

19:50.060 --> 19:53.196
Who can prove they're the
baddest girl at school?

19:59.703 --> 20:02.505
Does Alex Russo have this in her locker?

20:05.743 --> 20:08.211
I knew it wasn't me.

20:11.215 --> 20:13.683
You are in a wagonload of trouble.

20:13.717 --> 20:17.020
Eh. Bring it on, Wild Bill Laritate.

20:19.056 --> 20:20.223
Very well.

20:20.257 --> 20:23.092
I'll see you at the next
three Saturday detentions.

20:24.561 --> 20:26.629
Hey, I'm not busy on the fourth Saturday.

20:26.664 --> 20:28.498
Maybe we can do something?

20:30.968 --> 20:32.468
All right. What's going on?

20:32.503 --> 20:34.203
Why'd you do it?

20:34.238 --> 20:37.040
I figured if Justin got into detention,

20:37.074 --> 20:39.442
Eddie and them would vote
for him and he'd win.

20:40.277 --> 20:42.912
I was wrong about you, Stevie.

20:42.946 --> 20:44.747
And I was wrong about you, Alex.

20:44.782 --> 20:46.683
You knew how much I cared about this

20:46.717 --> 20:49.085
and you were willing to
take the fall for me.

20:50.821 --> 20:53.189
Well, you're my brother.

20:53.223 --> 20:57.126
And that 20 bucks I stole from
you earlier, well, we're even.

20:58.629 --> 21:00.129
And I was wrong about you.

21:00.164 --> 21:01.831
'Cause you didn't do the prank.

21:01.865 --> 21:04.667
So, he's no longer a them, boys.

21:04.702 --> 21:05.668
He's a "get him!"

21:05.703 --> 21:06.736
Wait!

21:09.173 --> 21:10.840
Mom!

21:12.943 --> 21:15.178
All right, so what's the
real reason you did it?

21:15.212 --> 21:17.780
The second biggest
troublemaker of the school

21:17.815 --> 21:21.150
is the sister of the President.

21:21.185 --> 21:24.487
There's a lot of ways to go with that.

21:25.756 --> 21:27.757
You're right.

21:27.791 --> 21:31.327
Another masterful plan.

21:31.362 --> 21:33.629
All we gotta do is work on your evil laugh

21:33.664 --> 21:35.098
and we could be good friends.

21:43.173 --> 21:44.974
Tell her her dress is pretty.

21:46.076 --> 21:47.410
Your dress is pretty.

21:47.444 --> 21:49.445
Aw, thank you.

21:49.480 --> 21:51.614
We can all be friends.

21:55.252 --> 21:57.989
Oh, thank you. Thank you so much!

21:58.144 --> 22:00.107
You are very kind people.

22:00.413 --> 22:02.613
Oh!
