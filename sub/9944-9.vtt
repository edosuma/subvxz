00:02.500 --> 00:05.572
Tickets this way
for the Chatsworth Express!

00:05.660 --> 00:08.173
Come and watch pikeys making a mess

00:08.260 --> 00:11.855
of the lives they were given by
'im upstairs...

00:11.940 --> 00:14.898
And kids they're convinced
aren't actually theirs.

00:14.980 --> 00:16.094
Wicked!

00:16.180 --> 00:17.499
Piss off!

00:17.580 --> 00:21.368
What sounds on Earth
could ever replace

00:21.460 --> 00:24.497
kids needing money
or wives in your face?

00:24.580 --> 00:26.935
Cos this, people reckon -
me included -

00:27.020 --> 00:29.488
is why pubs and drugs

00:29.580 --> 00:31.172
were kindly invented...

00:31.260 --> 00:33.774
To calm us all down
and stop us going mental.

00:33.860 --> 00:38.570
These are Chatsworth Estate's
basic essentials.

00:38.660 --> 00:44.815
We are worth every penny
for grinding your axes...

00:44.900 --> 00:46.379
You sit on our head,

00:46.460 --> 00:49.133
but... you pay the taxes.

00:49.220 --> 00:50.619
CHEERING

00:50.700 --> 00:53.373
Imagine Britain
without Chatsworth buccaneers

00:53.460 --> 00:56.691
who'd come on your face
for the price of a beer, eh?

00:56.780 --> 00:58.259
Eh!

00:58.340 --> 01:02.094
Make poverty history.
Cheaper drugs now!

01:02.180 --> 01:07.049
Make poverty history!
Cheaper drugs now!

01:07.140 --> 01:08.459
CHUCKLES

01:08.540 --> 01:12.169
Scatter! Party!

01:18.540 --> 01:22.294
(Monica) 'It's a funny idea,
the genes passing through you.

01:22.380 --> 01:24.371
'One generation to the next,

01:24.460 --> 01:27.736
'like little instruction manuals
to the future,

01:27.820 --> 01:30.380
'on how to make another one
that's got your eyes,

01:30.460 --> 01:32.690
'or your... way with words.'

01:32.780 --> 01:35.374
Come to my baby shower. Have a laugh!

01:35.460 --> 01:38.577
'It's like you're all in
a great long conga line,

01:38.660 --> 01:40.935
'your mum and dad behind you... '

01:41.020 --> 01:42.976
Want one? ...Tosser!

01:43.060 --> 01:46.973
'Your kids out in front,
and their kids in front of them.'

01:47.060 --> 01:51.133
Baby shower, for me. For us.
List of what I want.

01:51.220 --> 01:54.769
'Until maybe, one day,
one of them's such a minger,

01:54.860 --> 01:56.532
'no-one wants to mate with 'em.'

01:56.620 --> 01:58.690
Baby shower, Nerys... for <i>me.</i>

02:03.980 --> 02:06.778
'That's never gonna happen
with my lot, though.

02:06.860 --> 02:09.818
'Parents like Frank and me,

02:09.900 --> 02:12.016
'they don't know how lucky they are.'

02:16.340 --> 02:18.092
Here you go, Karen.

02:18.180 --> 02:20.569
Baby shower. For me.

02:20.660 --> 02:22.730
I thought baby showers were supposed
to be arranged by your mates.

02:22.820 --> 02:25.129
Well, don't want to
stand on ceremony, do I?

02:25.220 --> 02:27.654
Might not have
the actual party, though,

02:27.740 --> 02:30.459
it's gonna be a bit pricey, but you
can drop your gift off any time...

02:30.540 --> 02:31.893
Did that woman find you?

02:31.980 --> 02:33.379
What woman?

02:33.460 --> 02:35.735
She came in this morning asking
for you so I gave her the address.

02:35.820 --> 02:37.094
What did she want?

02:37.180 --> 02:38.818
She left her stuff here and all.

02:38.900 --> 02:41.698
We nearly exploded it, I thought
it was a fuckin' bomb.

02:41.780 --> 02:44.340
Joan Dallimore. Mean anything?

02:48.260 --> 02:50.137
Mum?

02:51.180 --> 02:53.648
No. Nothing at all.

Come on, love, it's not far. I'll show you.

03:09.660 --> 03:13.050
You go down this road here,
and it's on the left-hand side,

03:13.140 --> 03:15.096
you can't miss it. OK?

03:15.180 --> 03:17.171
Oi!

03:17.260 --> 03:19.933
No fuckin' way, give that back...

03:20.020 --> 03:21.373
Do one!

03:23.740 --> 03:25.412
You're not having that and all.

03:26.380 --> 03:28.211
Get off! Go on!

03:36.220 --> 03:39.690
Hey, listen up, I've had a great idea.

03:39.780 --> 03:41.611
Why don't we all go out?

03:41.700 --> 03:44.897
Go out for a picnic or something, hey?

03:44.980 --> 03:46.459
We've just had lunch.

03:46.540 --> 03:48.337
And anyway, look, me and Mandy
are making you a baby blanket.

03:48.420 --> 03:50.570
Oh, you don't have to bother with that.

03:50.660 --> 03:52.571
You're not gonna get anything
else from your baby shower!

03:52.660 --> 03:54.139
< Frank! Dead to the world.

03:55.180 --> 03:58.013
Well, all right, then, I'll go on my own.

04:04.540 --> 04:05.939
DOORBELL RINGS

04:15.340 --> 04:16.898
It's taken me ages to get here.

04:16.980 --> 04:18.618
I've been up and down and round,

04:18.700 --> 04:21.930
I've been all over the fuckin' place.
Look at my hair.

04:22.019 --> 04:23.089
Sorry, do we know you?

04:24.700 --> 04:27.419
It's all right, Debbie. I do.

04:28.580 --> 04:29.774
Hello, Mother.

04:31.620 --> 04:33.133
Awful place.

04:33.220 --> 04:37.179
Where's me handbag? Anyway, in we go.

04:43.980 --> 04:47.768
Now, don't forget, dinner's in the freezer.
And if...

04:47.860 --> 04:51.091
It's fine, just go and have a good time.

04:51.180 --> 04:53.694
Yep, adios, amigos.

04:53.780 --> 04:56.248
Manana, Costa del Sol, hey?

05:01.900 --> 05:05.256
Right, that's it. Can't leave these two
in charge of the house,

05:05.340 --> 05:07.774
out of our tiny fucking minds.

05:07.860 --> 05:10.738
Paddy, you promised me this holiday.

05:15.740 --> 05:17.492
- Have a good one!
- Hasta la vista!

05:17.580 --> 05:18.649
See ya!

05:18.740 --> 05:20.059
A week.

05:20.140 --> 05:22.893
A fuckin' week!

05:27.500 --> 05:28.728
Come on!

05:28.980 --> 05:31.255
We can get dressed up
in Mum's clothes.

05:31.340 --> 05:33.456
we can smoke in the bog
with the door open.

05:33.540 --> 05:35.770
We can have a party!

05:35.860 --> 05:38.772
Get the gear! It's in the cabinet.

05:45.020 --> 05:46.976
Do I look like a fuckin' numpty?

05:48.580 --> 05:51.777
How're we gonna have a fuckin' party
with no gear?

05:55.620 --> 05:57.417
You've aged, Monica.

05:57.500 --> 05:59.092
WATER SPLASHES

05:59.180 --> 06:00.135
We both have.

06:00.220 --> 06:02.017
Piling on the weight again?

06:02.100 --> 06:03.249
She's pregnant.

06:03.340 --> 06:06.377
I've never known what to do
with her, stay off the cakes,

06:06.460 --> 06:08.018
that's what the doctor said.

06:08.100 --> 06:11.536
You should trim down,
like this one, what are you, size 8?

06:11.620 --> 06:15.249
Aged 10, she was a 14. She had
puffy knees, because of the weight.

06:15.340 --> 06:19.299
I took her to the doctor's,
he said, "self-inflicted",

06:19.380 --> 06:21.575
that's what he said.
Where's me handbag?

06:21.660 --> 06:25.175
You could see it in the way
she walked, wasn't nice.

06:25.260 --> 06:28.332
If you'd fed me more than
a lettuce leaf from time to time,

06:28.420 --> 06:31.492
I wouldn't have had to stuff
myself with sweets, would I?

06:31.580 --> 06:33.298
She were fat as a whale.

06:33.380 --> 06:35.336
And then off she goes and abandons me.

06:35.420 --> 06:37.411
- You threw me out.
- I never threw you out.

06:37.500 --> 06:39.968
- You charged me rent.
- That's fair enough.

06:40.060 --> 06:41.539
I were <i>ten.</i>

06:41.620 --> 06:46.853
Then back she comes, tits akimbo,
nothing but lies.

06:46.940 --> 06:50.615
He-he, you've aged,
you've started piling on the weight again.

06:50.700 --> 06:53.817
Did you come back for something,
or do you just want another row?

06:53.900 --> 06:56.778
I've come to see you, haven't I?

06:56.860 --> 06:58.418
What's in here?

06:58.500 --> 07:00.968
Oh, I say, that's not right, is it?
GLASS JARS TINKLE

07:02.860 --> 07:07.536
Yvonne. I just saw the crime report,
why didn't you phone me?

07:07.620 --> 07:10.851
I can't come crying to you every time, can I?

07:10.940 --> 07:13.693
I just rung 999,
some officers dealt with it.

07:13.780 --> 07:15.691
- Look, let me see that...
- No.

07:17.660 --> 07:20.094
If you're too nice to me, I might...

07:21.620 --> 07:22.973
I don't know.

07:25.860 --> 07:29.409
Just so bloody hard sometimes.

07:30.620 --> 07:33.180
Shop, and kids...

07:34.820 --> 07:36.412
...trying to get by.

07:36.500 --> 07:39.970
You need a man in your life, Yvonne,
someone to look after you.

07:42.100 --> 07:44.409
Are you making a pass at me, Stan?

07:52.140 --> 07:55.052
Go on, Stan. Yeah. That's it.

08:06.300 --> 08:07.733
Debbie. Debbie!

08:07.820 --> 08:09.014
Who's downstairs?

08:09.100 --> 08:11.170
Joan. Mum's mum.

08:13.620 --> 08:15.531
Well, what does she want?

08:15.620 --> 08:17.053
She says she come to visit.

08:18.980 --> 08:21.892
I thought she was murdered
by a jealous lover in Rio.

08:24.580 --> 08:25.535
(Fuck.)

08:28.660 --> 08:30.935
(What the fuck is she doing here?

08:31.020 --> 08:34.011
(I don't know!
Will you tell her to go, please?

08:34.100 --> 08:38.775
(We don't wanna... antagonise her, do I? We...

08:38.860 --> 08:39.849
(Why not?

08:39.940 --> 08:42.408
(That's all she's ever done to me.

08:42.500 --> 08:45.219
(And you're the one that's refused
to see her for God knows how long.

08:45.300 --> 08:47.609
(Yeah, but I... I... )

08:49.900 --> 08:52.334
SIGHS

08:52.420 --> 08:54.092
(Look, we don't want any trouble.)

08:54.180 --> 08:55.374
...AII right, Joan, love?

08:55.460 --> 08:58.850
Nice to see you, just saying,
stay as long as you like.

09:02.740 --> 09:04.298
So, er, how've you been?

09:04.380 --> 09:06.098
I'm fine, thanks.

09:06.180 --> 09:09.377
Looking good. As always, I mean...

09:11.060 --> 09:13.369
She can have Debbie's room, can't she?

09:13.460 --> 09:19.012
You don't mind sharing with Mandy...
a few nights, do you?

09:19.100 --> 09:22.092
Yeah, so, do you need any help
with your bags, Joan?

09:22.180 --> 09:23.659
Thanks.

09:23.740 --> 09:25.332
Titanic finally docked yet, or what?

09:27.500 --> 09:29.570
Oh, no! I'm travelling light.

09:29.660 --> 09:31.378
What are you talking about?

09:31.460 --> 09:33.815
You've left your bags in the pub,
I've already seen 'em.

09:33.900 --> 09:35.219
Eh? Did I?

09:35.300 --> 09:38.212
You don't have to pretend.
I don't know what you're doing,

09:38.300 --> 09:41.133
but you're not doing it here,
you are going home.

09:41.220 --> 09:43.450
I'm not. I'm not.

09:43.540 --> 09:45.531
I'm not going there, he's wrong.

09:45.620 --> 09:48.088
I don't know what he meant.

09:49.380 --> 09:52.850
Alzheimer's? I haven't got Alzheimer's.

09:52.940 --> 09:57.252
I'm not going, I'm here with you,
I'm not going in no home,

09:57.340 --> 09:59.331
I'm staying here.

10:00.900 --> 10:01.855
SHE SIGHS

10:05.340 --> 10:08.059
Managed to get hold of a neighbour.

10:08.140 --> 10:10.938
Turns out she'd burned her flat down.

10:11.020 --> 10:12.738
Fucking hell!

10:12.820 --> 10:16.096
Yeah, she were that confused,
someone called a doctor.

10:16.180 --> 10:18.853
He diagnosed Alzheimer's,

10:18.940 --> 10:23.058
booked her into a care home,
so she's done a runner.

10:23.140 --> 10:26.928
Oh, but, well, yeah, that's good news, innit?
A care home - job done!

10:27.020 --> 10:29.898
Write me off that quick as well,
would you, Frank?

10:29.980 --> 10:32.448
You've got to phone the Social, Mon.

10:32.540 --> 10:34.974
There's no choice, is there?

10:37.020 --> 10:38.214
What could we do?

10:38.300 --> 10:41.019
You were the one that said
she could stay in the first place.

10:41.100 --> 10:43.853
Well, that was just to please...
Just... Oh...

10:47.900 --> 10:49.333
Oh, I don't know.

10:55.020 --> 10:58.330
What the fucking hell's she waiting for?

11:05.980 --> 11:07.936
Hiya, love.

11:18.100 --> 11:20.455
I just thought I'd come and see if you were...

11:33.620 --> 11:35.019
WHISTLES
Oi!

11:35.100 --> 11:37.295
I'm not paying you to miss bits.

11:39.140 --> 11:42.655
Mate of mine in the motor trade
wants three ringers nicking,

11:42.740 --> 11:44.253
- 100 quid a pop.
- That's 300 quid.

11:44.340 --> 11:48.618
And how much gear d'you
think we'll get for that, eh?

11:48.700 --> 11:51.373
Can I come in on that?

11:51.460 --> 11:54.179
I can help nick cars. What we getting?

11:54.260 --> 11:57.889
A smack round the fucking head,
you don't shut up and finish me car.

11:57.980 --> 11:59.459
HAWKS AND SPITS

12:01.940 --> 12:03.373
Little shit! >

12:09.540 --> 12:10.939
All right, Mandy.

12:11.020 --> 12:13.090
Yeah, I just...

12:13.180 --> 12:16.775
Eh? What about old Joan, eh?

12:16.860 --> 12:20.170
How much do you think
she can remember,

12:20.260 --> 12:22.171
you know, then, of things.

12:22.260 --> 12:24.137
I'm not a doctor, Frank. Dunno.

12:24.220 --> 12:27.815
A lot about the past, but recently...

12:27.900 --> 12:29.811
Oh, right, so...

12:29.900 --> 12:33.017
Like sort of 20ish years ago, would she?

12:33.100 --> 12:35.091
Dunno. Maybe.

12:35.180 --> 12:38.138
Why? What did you do, Frank?

12:38.220 --> 12:40.211
What, I? Me? Nothing.

12:40.300 --> 12:41.733
No, I'm just, y'know...

12:41.820 --> 12:47.133
Just about <i>concern</i> about Monica. Just...

12:47.220 --> 12:50.257
Oh, fucking...! Can't ask
a fucking question round here

12:50.340 --> 12:52.251
without the fucking third degree!

12:52.340 --> 12:55.013
For God's sake, Mum,
stop following me around!

12:55.100 --> 12:56.055
You're not leaving me?

12:56.140 --> 12:57.334
I'm just going out for a minute.

12:57.420 --> 12:59.012
- I'll come with you.
- Oh!

12:59.100 --> 13:00.215
You all right?

13:00.300 --> 13:03.098
Get away from us! Fuck off!

13:03.180 --> 13:04.613
Get back where you came from!

13:04.700 --> 13:05.655
You fucking what?!

13:05.740 --> 13:09.096
Norma, this is me mum.
She's got Alzheimer's.

13:09.180 --> 13:10.499
I don't give a shit what she's got.

13:10.580 --> 13:12.377
Norma? Norma?

13:12.460 --> 13:14.849
I know that name. I know that name.

13:14.940 --> 13:16.976
Norma is a friend of mine.

13:17.060 --> 13:19.096
A friend of yours? Is she?

13:19.180 --> 13:22.695
She's not? Is she that poofter?

13:22.780 --> 13:27.171
Auntie Peg said there was a poofter.
She never said she was coloured.

13:27.260 --> 13:28.852
Are you gonna let her get
away with that, Monica?

13:28.940 --> 13:30.453
I don't know what to bloody do!

13:30.540 --> 13:34.613
You've always got to be different.
You've always got to shock.

13:34.700 --> 13:35.655
Who are you?

13:35.740 --> 13:38.652
Get away from us!
Get back where you came from!

13:38.740 --> 13:40.856
My name is Norma.

13:40.940 --> 13:44.057
Norma? I know that name.

13:44.140 --> 13:46.574
It's like talking to a bloody goldfish.

13:46.660 --> 13:51.973
Frank, love, will you take her for me
...before I start to self-harm?

13:54.020 --> 13:55.897
Eh, come on...

13:55.980 --> 13:57.936
No fucking chance, sunshine.

14:06.700 --> 14:07.735
You all right, bird?

14:10.260 --> 14:12.694
Where is she?

14:12.780 --> 14:15.135
Locked her in the wardrobe.

14:15.220 --> 14:16.778
Frank's taken her to the pub.

14:16.860 --> 14:20.933
Oh! I think I prefer the wardrobe.

14:21.020 --> 14:22.738
So what are you gonna do, Mon, eh?

14:22.820 --> 14:25.334
You don't have to put up
with this shite, you know?

14:25.420 --> 14:27.980
One phone call
and she's out of your hair.

14:28.060 --> 14:29.493
Fucking payback.

14:29.580 --> 14:32.458
Payback? Why? What for?

14:32.540 --> 14:36.453
Mon's dad fucked off
when she was about four.

14:36.540 --> 14:40.135
From that moment on,
Monica couldn't do a thing right.

14:41.740 --> 14:45.449
She used to leave me
on my own all night,

14:45.540 --> 14:47.735
said she couldn't stand me.

14:47.820 --> 14:49.617
Used to cry myself to sleep.

14:49.700 --> 14:54.820
Then Joan got herself
a bloody bastard boyfriend, Dennis,

14:54.900 --> 14:57.698
whose shite smelt of roses.

14:57.780 --> 15:04.094
Turns out has his hands up Monica's skirt
every time the lights go off.

15:04.180 --> 15:06.136
I didn't want her to know that, Norma.

15:06.220 --> 15:08.780
Well, she's old enough.

15:08.860 --> 15:13.138
That woman was an evil old hag
to your mother.

15:13.220 --> 15:16.257
I should know.
I've got the therapy bills to prove it.

15:16.340 --> 15:18.490
Why didn't you say anything?

15:20.100 --> 15:22.694
If he groped you,

15:22.780 --> 15:25.135
you should have just told her.

15:25.220 --> 15:27.415
I did. >

15:27.500 --> 15:29.855
She called me a liar,

15:29.940 --> 15:32.738
said she wished she'd never had me.

15:35.260 --> 15:37.820
You don't have to forgive her, Monica.

15:51.340 --> 15:52.773
Yvonne?

15:55.260 --> 15:58.138
Pull your trousers up, come on.

15:58.220 --> 16:01.098
Oh, you are in. I thought
you weren't cos the door...

16:02.220 --> 16:03.733
What the fuck happened to you?

16:03.820 --> 16:05.378
Erm...

16:06.980 --> 16:09.096
This? I got done over yesterday.

16:09.180 --> 16:11.057
Stan were just...

16:11.140 --> 16:12.971
- (Kid) I'm starving.
- Now, come on. Two at a time!

16:13.060 --> 16:17.417
Yvonne, do you fancy
going on a, y'know?

16:17.500 --> 16:18.899
< Right, let's be having you.

16:18.980 --> 16:21.494
(Kid) I only want a packet of crisps.
Fine, I'm leaving.

16:21.580 --> 16:22.490
(Yvonne) What we got here then?

16:22.580 --> 16:25.253
Well, I'll see you then, Yvonne.

16:31.020 --> 16:33.375
Jesus Chr...!

16:33.460 --> 16:36.736
You seen the state of the stockroom?

16:36.820 --> 16:39.015
Yeah. It's just...

16:39.100 --> 16:40.818
It'll be our bloody Chesney.

16:41.940 --> 16:44.500
Well, I hate to tell you this, Yvonne,

16:44.580 --> 16:47.333
but I think he's been having sex in there.

16:47.420 --> 16:50.492
- I can smell it.
- No!

16:53.300 --> 16:55.256
I'm gonna fucking kill him!

16:59.940 --> 17:01.373
This one's on the house.

17:01.460 --> 17:03.974
Ooh!

17:04.060 --> 17:08.053
So, how's the old grey matter then, Joan?

17:08.140 --> 17:10.449
Fancy a quiz?

17:10.819 --> 17:13.288
Somebody must have done.

17:14.700 --> 17:18.170
Yeah. So who's the Prime Minister then?

17:18.540 --> 17:19.814
No?

17:19.900 --> 17:23.575
Yeah, you're right, who cares.
You heard of the first moon landing?

17:23.660 --> 17:24.455
Eh?

17:24.540 --> 17:28.579
Mm? Neil Armstrong, Buzz Lightyear.

17:28.660 --> 17:30.173
How many legs has a donkey got?

17:30.260 --> 17:33.457
What am I drinking?
Where's your handbag?

17:35.180 --> 17:37.216
Shot to fuck, aren't you, kid?

17:37.300 --> 17:39.768
Can't remember a sodding thing.

17:39.860 --> 17:41.896
Happy fucking days!

17:41.980 --> 17:44.733
Oh, who's your girlfriend there, Frank?

17:44.820 --> 17:45.775
Oh, no.

17:47.300 --> 17:51.339
This, Lillian, is Monica's mum, Joan.

17:51.420 --> 17:53.456
Say hello, Joan.

17:53.540 --> 17:55.451
No, I'm not his girlfriend.

17:55.540 --> 18:00.375
Except once, on Monica's birthday,
we had sex.

18:03.980 --> 18:05.459
But it's a secret.

18:09.260 --> 18:11.376
(Frank) Oh, come on!

18:11.460 --> 18:14.452
Well, I mean...

18:14.540 --> 18:18.658
She's fucking... tonto, in't she?

18:18.740 --> 18:20.890
What? I mean... I mean...

18:20.980 --> 18:22.254
Oh!

18:22.340 --> 18:26.379
Right, now, listen up,

18:26.460 --> 18:27.939
Mum,

18:28.020 --> 18:30.853
just to clarify,

18:30.940 --> 18:33.408
what you just said

18:33.500 --> 18:38.335
didn't happen. If it did - <i>if</i> -

18:38.420 --> 18:42.015
then it was a mistake,

18:42.100 --> 18:47.220
cos I would have been drunk and you...

18:47.300 --> 18:49.256
You were just

18:49.340 --> 18:53.094
a wicked old witch who wanted
whatever your daughter was getting.

18:53.180 --> 18:55.216
Ooh, this takes me back!

18:55.300 --> 18:56.972
MUSIC: Young Hearts Run Free
by Candi Staton

18:57.060 --> 18:58.015
Ohh!

18:58.100 --> 18:59.977
Ooh, dance with me, Frank.

19:00.060 --> 19:01.652
No, Joan, I...

19:01.740 --> 19:03.093
Dance with me!

19:06.460 --> 19:09.099
Only if you keep your fucking mouth <i>shut.</i>

19:18.260 --> 19:22.219
Stan, I'm beginning to think you've
got some kind of eating disorder.

19:22.300 --> 19:25.053
Cos that's the third meal that
you haven't touched in two days.

19:25.140 --> 19:26.539
I'm in love with Yvonne.

19:30.460 --> 19:33.896
No, I don't think I heard you right there.
Did you say?

19:33.980 --> 19:37.450
I'm. In. Love. With. Yvonne.

19:39.820 --> 19:41.651
D'you mean...

19:41.740 --> 19:43.492
Yvonne Yvonne?

19:43.580 --> 19:45.810
"Scary Yvonne in the shop" Yvonne?

19:45.900 --> 19:49.290
Put it back or lose your dick.

19:51.940 --> 19:54.215
Well, there's a thing!

19:54.300 --> 19:58.339
Trouble is, I just don't know
if it's the same for her.

19:58.420 --> 19:59.899
I mean,

19:59.980 --> 20:01.732
she's definitely interested.

20:01.820 --> 20:04.732
That's it, Stan! Yeah!

20:04.820 --> 20:08.290
But when I hinted at us both
going out together, she...

20:10.180 --> 20:12.410
I think I got the brush-off.

20:12.500 --> 20:15.219
Well, if you're sure
that this is definitely

20:15.300 --> 20:17.894
what you want...

20:17.980 --> 20:20.892
well, you'll just have to go in there
and ask her straight.

20:20.980 --> 20:23.619
No messing. Kill or cure.

20:23.700 --> 20:25.418
Yeah.

20:25.500 --> 20:27.889
Yeah, yeah, you're right.

20:27.980 --> 20:30.778
I'll just go in there and I'll ask her.

20:42.300 --> 20:43.289
Yvonne?

20:45.500 --> 20:50.369
Yvonne, I want to ask you something
and I really need you to... Whoa!

20:55.500 --> 20:58.219
D'you wanna go out with me one night?
Down The Jockey or...

20:58.300 --> 20:59.415
Stan, I don't drink.

20:59.500 --> 21:01.968
Well, dinner, then, or a film or...

21:02.060 --> 21:05.769
I want to go on a date with you
instead of just having sex.

21:05.860 --> 21:07.054
We're friends, aren't we?

21:07.140 --> 21:09.415
Well, that's all right, isn't it?

21:09.500 --> 21:11.809
Look...

21:11.900 --> 21:13.174
Stan, me and you...

21:13.260 --> 21:16.332
I mean, I don't know if I were
just reacting to t'stress

21:16.420 --> 21:18.138
of being attacked or summat.

21:19.780 --> 21:21.418
I mean, you're a lovely man.

21:22.540 --> 21:24.212
You're just... >

21:24.300 --> 21:25.335
Yeah, not boyfriend material.

21:25.420 --> 21:27.376
I didn't say that.

21:27.460 --> 21:29.098
What are you saying, Yvonne?

21:31.460 --> 21:33.815
It's all right.

21:33.900 --> 21:35.333
I understand.

21:37.380 --> 21:38.335
I won't trouble you again.

21:38.420 --> 21:40.138
Stan, don't be like that!

21:40.220 --> 21:41.858
< Stan!

21:56.860 --> 21:58.851
Here y'are, there's one.

22:00.820 --> 22:02.697
Golf GTi.

22:02.780 --> 22:04.372
And it's a V plate.

22:16.700 --> 22:19.339
CAR ALARMS BLARE

22:21.460 --> 22:23.018
Fuck!

22:23.100 --> 22:27.218
Leg it! Come on!

22:35.060 --> 22:36.459
CAR ALARMS BLARE IN DISTANCE

22:36.540 --> 22:37.973
< Whoo!

22:38.060 --> 22:41.257
Lovely boys! Come here.

22:41.420 --> 22:44.696
You what? That's like shagging me gran!

22:44.780 --> 22:46.498
You come here. Come on.

22:46.580 --> 22:48.935
- Come on!
- What you doing?

22:49.020 --> 22:50.976
Wanna fuck? Give you all a blow job!

22:51.060 --> 22:54.416
Get back to your home, slapper!

22:54.500 --> 22:55.489
< Mother!

22:55.660 --> 22:57.298
Get off me! Get off me, bitch!

22:57.380 --> 23:00.292
- Get inside!
- Get off me!

23:00.380 --> 23:03.611
Ow! Oh, Frank, come and help me.

23:03.700 --> 23:05.816
Get off me!

23:05.900 --> 23:08.209
You were supposed to be
looking after her. Ow!

23:08.300 --> 23:09.653
Mother, you're hurting me!

23:09.740 --> 23:12.254
Why d'you do it?

23:12.340 --> 23:14.535
Stop it! I've made up my mind.

23:14.620 --> 23:16.258
You're going in that home!

23:16.340 --> 23:18.012
Ughhh! Oh!

23:20.460 --> 23:22.655
Oh, God.

23:22.740 --> 23:25.208
SOBBING

23:25.300 --> 23:27.530
Where's me handbag?
Where's me handbag?

23:27.620 --> 23:30.976
Oh, what's in your sodding handbag?!

23:39.940 --> 23:43.694
How many fucking sleeping pills
does she need?

23:43.780 --> 23:47.659
That's enough to put an elephant out.

23:47.740 --> 23:49.537
(Joan) I'm not going in no home.
I'm not going.

23:49.620 --> 23:53.533
See, I've found another way.

23:53.620 --> 23:56.578
I just need to find me daughter first.

23:57.660 --> 24:00.652
< I need to find me daughter.

24:00.740 --> 24:02.731
Ohh...

24:02.820 --> 24:06.699
SHE WEEPS

24:16.940 --> 24:19.374
What were those things?
Those things I've lost?

24:19.460 --> 24:20.449
It was something important.

24:20.540 --> 24:22.531
You haven't lost anything, Mum.

24:22.620 --> 24:23.689
It's not here. >

24:25.860 --> 24:29.375
Oh, I see, you've...

24:29.460 --> 24:32.213
Well, I'm not gonna
wait for your help, am I?

24:32.300 --> 24:33.858
Oh...

24:33.940 --> 24:39.378
Oh, a lady in the milk jar
was telling me where to fish.

24:39.460 --> 24:41.769
HE LAUGHS
Yeah, right.

24:43.340 --> 24:46.855
(Monica) Oh, don't laugh. Don't laugh at her.

24:46.940 --> 24:48.771
Come on, Mum.

24:48.860 --> 24:54.457
< We're going out.
We need to spend some time together.

24:54.540 --> 24:57.771
There you go, there's your bag.

24:57.860 --> 24:59.851
(Monica) Come on. Buy you a coffee.

24:59.940 --> 25:01.817
(Joan) And can we have some cake?

25:01.900 --> 25:03.777
(Monica) And some cake, yes.

25:03.860 --> 25:05.373
DOOR SLAMS

25:29.340 --> 25:33.015
Here y'are. It says here,
if you lift t'car up from t'front,

25:33.100 --> 25:34.215
it thinks it's being towed.

25:34.300 --> 25:35.938
Alarm still goes. I've tried it.

25:36.020 --> 25:37.897
(Fuck!)

25:37.980 --> 25:39.299
All right?

25:39.380 --> 25:41.974
What the fuck are you so happy about?

25:43.780 --> 25:44.895
Here we go.

25:58.100 --> 26:01.695
That's the one you wanted,
isn't it? Golf, V plates?

26:01.780 --> 26:04.613
How the fucking fuck?

26:05.700 --> 26:08.168
Wasn't there no alarm on it?

26:08.260 --> 26:09.978
I dunno. Didn't look.

26:10.060 --> 26:11.937
ALARM BEEPS

26:13.780 --> 26:15.259
Yep, there is.

26:18.340 --> 26:20.376
Keys.

26:20.460 --> 26:22.530
You're cutting me in on the deal, then?

26:26.340 --> 26:30.174
So if they're paying 100 quid a car,

26:30.260 --> 26:33.536
I say we split it 75/25 in my favour.

26:33.620 --> 26:35.338
On your fucking bike!

26:35.420 --> 26:37.809
I'm the one who knows
how to nick 'em, so...

26:37.900 --> 26:41.688
(Imitating Noel Edmonds)
...deal... or no deal?

26:45.100 --> 26:47.819
Yeah, all right, then. Seems fair.

26:47.900 --> 26:50.892
- Mickey, can I have a word...
- No, no, let's just give it...

26:50.980 --> 26:53.335
Mickey, we won't have enough
for a fucking party, will we?

26:53.420 --> 26:54.899
Yeah, we will.
(Mouths) Trust me.

26:56.540 --> 27:00.613
Four cars, but you've got to get
all of them before you get paid.

27:00.700 --> 27:01.655
I thought it was three.

27:01.740 --> 27:03.458
Yeah, well, it's four.

27:05.060 --> 27:07.972
All right.

27:08.060 --> 27:09.095
What's up next, then?

27:09.180 --> 27:10.932
Beemer soft-top, V plate,

27:11.020 --> 27:14.376
or a Renault Clio three-door
Dynamique 804, take your pick.

27:14.460 --> 27:16.928
What do those ones look like again?

27:35.660 --> 27:37.457
You all right, mate?

27:37.540 --> 27:39.451
Hey, kid.

27:39.540 --> 27:41.929
Hey, look at me. >

27:42.020 --> 27:45.012
You all right? Huh?

27:45.100 --> 27:46.055
Talk to me.

27:46.140 --> 27:48.176
What's the matter? >

27:48.260 --> 27:50.251
Can you hear me? Hello? >

27:50.340 --> 27:53.616
I'm gonna pick you up,
take you out of the road.

27:58.260 --> 28:00.012
Oi! Hey!

28:00.100 --> 28:02.250
Come here, you little shit!

28:07.180 --> 28:10.968
What I'm saying is,
if you really had wanted to,

28:11.060 --> 28:12.459
you know, with them pills,

28:12.540 --> 28:15.179
then you'd have done it already,
wouldn't you?

28:15.260 --> 28:18.058
Instead of coming to me.

28:18.140 --> 28:22.531
So I think, deep down...

28:23.940 --> 28:25.976
...you know that going into a home...

28:26.060 --> 28:28.574
I never liked my daughter,
d'you know that?

28:28.660 --> 28:31.094
I told her once, I wish I'd never had her.

28:31.180 --> 28:34.172
- But Mum, let's not...
- I never told her why, though.

28:36.780 --> 28:38.816
Why?

28:38.900 --> 28:40.572
Why didn't you like her?

28:40.660 --> 28:42.616
Because she looked like him,

28:42.700 --> 28:45.578
like her father.

28:45.660 --> 28:47.378
Yeah...

28:47.460 --> 28:51.055
The only man I ever loved.

28:51.140 --> 28:52.698
Ee, I loved him.

28:55.780 --> 28:58.738
But, one day...
WHISTLES

28:58.820 --> 29:01.414
CHUCKLES RUEFULLY

29:01.500 --> 29:03.411
Never made no sense.

29:03.500 --> 29:06.412
I cried and cried,

29:06.500 --> 29:09.298
but he wouldn't come back.

29:09.380 --> 29:12.452
And there she was still,

29:12.540 --> 29:14.656
every day,

29:14.740 --> 29:17.857
looking at me with his eyes...

29:20.180 --> 29:23.411
...ripping me heart out.

29:23.500 --> 29:27.254
Cos every time I looked at her,
all I could see was him.

29:30.060 --> 29:31.778
My boyfriend

29:31.860 --> 29:34.215
used to touch her - Dennis.

29:35.820 --> 29:38.459
I'd wake up in the night, find him gone.

29:38.540 --> 29:43.978
I knew what he was doing,
but... I never stopped him.

29:44.060 --> 29:45.573
I wanted her punished.

29:48.980 --> 29:51.050
Oh...

29:51.140 --> 29:55.019
Do you think she could forgive me?

29:55.100 --> 29:57.933
Because I need her to.

29:58.020 --> 30:01.649
You know, I need to clean it all before I go.

30:08.700 --> 30:09.928
BMW.

30:13.260 --> 30:16.252
And Renault Clio.
What d'you need for the last one?

30:16.340 --> 30:20.333
Oh, Lada Riva, D-reg.

30:20.420 --> 30:22.775
Some loser wants one.

30:22.860 --> 30:24.054
Here y'are.

30:26.820 --> 30:29.050
All right.

30:34.220 --> 30:35.972
D-reg Lada?

30:36.060 --> 30:40.292
Exactly. He'll hunt a month of
fucking Giro days for one of them.

30:40.380 --> 30:44.214
- They've all gone to scrap.
- You fucking genius.

30:44.300 --> 30:45.494
LAUGHS

30:47.380 --> 30:51.089
- Frank?
- Mmm...

30:51.180 --> 30:55.139
Would you do something for me
if I asked you?

30:55.220 --> 30:58.610
Oh... No, I'm busy...

30:58.700 --> 31:01.772
I don't mean now. I mean... in general.

31:01.860 --> 31:05.853
If it's about them salsa classes...

31:05.940 --> 31:09.376
No, not that! I mean if it
was something really important.

31:09.460 --> 31:11.451
< You won't get any sense out of him.

31:11.540 --> 31:14.259
Stupid git's taken some of
your mum's sleeping pills.

31:14.340 --> 31:15.898
Ohh!

31:15.980 --> 31:19.609
I just need to know if it's ever right

31:19.700 --> 31:23.978
to do something for someone
that they want,

31:24.060 --> 31:26.858
even if other people
might think it wasn't?

31:26.940 --> 31:32.617
Look, I know how low people
with Alzheimer's can get.

31:32.700 --> 31:35.737
But helping your mum
with those pills...

31:35.820 --> 31:39.813
Well, unless you want to end up
in Strangeways with half my family,

31:39.900 --> 31:41.174
you'll leave it alone.

31:45.500 --> 31:47.809
ALARM SOUNDS NEARBY

31:47.900 --> 31:50.289
(Norma) Surprised Stan's not been in today.

31:50.380 --> 31:52.814
What? Stan Stan?

31:52.900 --> 31:54.413
Goofy Stan?

31:54.500 --> 31:57.094
Stan "turns everything
into slapstick" Stan?

31:57.180 --> 32:02.049
Well, usually, but you know he caught
the blokes who robbed you, don't you?

32:02.140 --> 32:03.334
< Aye.

32:03.420 --> 32:07.379
Got right stuck in, I heard.
I thought he'd be in to tell you about it.

32:07.460 --> 32:09.610
No.

32:09.700 --> 32:11.099
No, he didn't.

32:11.180 --> 32:12.932
I reckon he fancies you.

32:13.020 --> 32:16.296
Perhaps he didn't want
to make a big deal of it.

32:16.380 --> 32:20.612
- He's all right, though?
- Oh, aye. Think so.

32:20.700 --> 32:23.089
Anyway, even if he did fancy me,

32:23.180 --> 32:25.489
that whole friendship thing,
it never works, does it?

32:25.580 --> 32:30.176
I don't know.
Always seemed like a good basis to me.

32:30.260 --> 32:33.172
You know, someone to get on with,
have a laugh.

32:33.260 --> 32:36.172
Bottom line is,
if he were that fucking interested,

32:36.260 --> 32:39.218
he'd be here, wouldn't he,
kicking down me door,

32:39.300 --> 32:40.972
not taking no for an answer?

32:41.060 --> 32:44.769
You know, faint heart never won
fair fucking lady and all that!

32:44.860 --> 32:49.695
I need a man who's my equal,
someone who's gonna stand up to me.

32:49.780 --> 32:52.533
Aye, righty-ho, then.

32:52.620 --> 32:53.689
< That's me done.

33:08.140 --> 33:11.098
VOICES TV, PEOPLE LAUGH >

33:50.380 --> 33:52.575
Do you know where it is?

33:52.660 --> 33:55.936
What is it I've lost? Me handbag?

33:56.020 --> 33:58.853
It's something important.
Where's me handbag?

34:00.460 --> 34:01.893
It's here, Mum.

34:01.980 --> 34:03.698
Oh...

34:23.139 --> 34:26.768
Now then, I've spoken to your daughter...

34:26.860 --> 34:28.293
SHE CLEARS HER THROAT

34:28.380 --> 34:32.259
...and she says...

34:32.340 --> 34:37.460
She says she can't change the past,
much as she might want to.

34:39.739 --> 34:43.255
And she says she can't forgive you.

34:51.179 --> 34:53.899
But she says that

34:53.980 --> 34:55.652
hearing you admit...

34:57.260 --> 35:00.570
...that you knew
what your boyfriend was doing, well...

35:02.580 --> 35:04.218
...that's a start.

35:08.980 --> 35:10.652
And I think...

35:13.260 --> 35:15.296
I get the impression that...

35:18.060 --> 35:21.097
...despite everything...

35:21.180 --> 35:24.377
your daughter loves you very, very much.

35:45.380 --> 35:48.053
- Hey, Mum, look, I've finished.
- It's lovely, Debbie.

35:54.820 --> 35:56.253
In a bit.

36:01.380 --> 36:04.452
Norma, would you pop upstairs
and wake Mum?

36:04.540 --> 36:05.689
- I'll go.
- No!

36:05.780 --> 36:08.499
Norma, would you?

36:08.580 --> 36:12.778
But if she starts on us again,
I'll wake her with a fucking cattle prod.

36:17.140 --> 36:18.573
< Joan?

36:18.660 --> 36:20.537
< KNOCKING ON DOOR

36:20.620 --> 36:22.053
< Joan?

36:26.540 --> 36:27.973
< Monica...

36:32.020 --> 36:34.250
I think you'd better come up.

36:46.060 --> 36:48.016
She's taken an overdose, Mon.

36:50.580 --> 36:52.810
Probably best thing for her, like...

36:52.900 --> 36:54.538
what with everything.

36:56.340 --> 36:58.012
I'll call an ambulance, eh?

37:09.900 --> 37:11.458
Oh, fucking hell...

37:13.660 --> 37:15.093
You all right, kid?

37:21.820 --> 37:23.253
Tell you what...

37:24.980 --> 37:27.096
I think you did the right thing.

37:28.700 --> 37:30.577
No, no, no word of a lie.

37:35.100 --> 37:37.853
I'd have done the same myself,
if you'd have asked me,

37:37.940 --> 37:39.692
for either of mine.

37:39.780 --> 37:41.577
Not a moment's hesitation.

37:48.420 --> 37:49.899
(Frank) You cry, love.

38:09.100 --> 38:12.934
Wait. Debbie, love, would you mind?

38:13.020 --> 38:14.612
No.

38:24.060 --> 38:25.129
Thanks.

38:29.940 --> 38:32.249
Come here, love.

38:36.420 --> 38:38.536
It's all right. It's only Nan.

38:40.260 --> 38:43.650
Right, you take the main road.
I'll go this way.

38:47.180 --> 38:50.889
Oh, managed to drag yourself out of bed
this morning then, did you?

38:52.500 --> 38:55.537
Carrie, that was mine.

38:55.620 --> 38:58.339
Oh, Carrie, come on.

38:58.420 --> 38:58.977
Mmm.

38:59.060 --> 39:01.210
I was saving that.

39:01.300 --> 39:03.609
I thought you was running on love alone.

39:03.700 --> 39:07.136
Didn't think you needed food
to fight for your lady's honour.

39:07.220 --> 39:09.450
Carrie...!

39:09.540 --> 39:11.929
I've had enough of everyone
treating me like a doormat.

39:21.380 --> 39:25.373
(Yvonne) We'll be getting more later
in the week. Is that all right, love?

39:25.460 --> 39:26.688
Yvonne,
I've got something to say to you.

39:26.780 --> 39:28.213
I'm serving...

39:28.300 --> 39:30.814
I don't care,
I won't be brushed aside again.

39:30.900 --> 39:34.654
Because... You women, you all say
there's no decent men in the world.

39:34.740 --> 39:37.937
But when you meet one,
all you do is write me off.

39:38.020 --> 39:41.012
It's rude, Yvonne,
and it hurts my feelings.

39:41.100 --> 39:42.738
I'm not a super hunk

39:42.820 --> 39:46.654
and maybe I don't fit in with
your idea of what it is you want.

39:46.740 --> 39:49.573
But I'm decent and kind

39:49.660 --> 39:52.572
and we could've been good together.
If you don't see that,

39:52.660 --> 39:57.176
if I was just an embarrassing shag
in the storeroom to you, it's your loss.

39:57.260 --> 39:59.854
SOFT MURMURS

40:07.780 --> 40:10.294
Stan!

40:10.380 --> 40:12.257
Stan! Stop, will ya?

40:14.180 --> 40:15.329
Look, Yvonne...

40:15.420 --> 40:18.492
Two nights a week, one of which
you have to come round to mine

40:18.580 --> 40:20.616
because I can't afford the childcare.

40:20.700 --> 40:23.851
My kids always come first
and you're not moving in.

40:23.940 --> 40:26.135
We'll just take things slowly.

40:26.220 --> 40:27.653
What are you saying?

40:27.740 --> 40:29.059
I'm saying...

40:29.140 --> 40:31.608
Yes, I will go out with you.

40:33.220 --> 40:35.495
But no teenage stuff.

40:35.580 --> 40:37.571
No gooey eyes,
game-playing and chocolate.

40:37.660 --> 40:39.298
Yeah, yeah, I get you.

40:39.380 --> 40:42.338
No flowers, no candles,
no weekends away.

40:45.060 --> 40:46.891
Come on.

40:50.340 --> 40:52.934
- Odd weekend away wouldn't hurt.
- Yeah.

40:53.020 --> 40:56.092
Once in a while.
You have to give me a bit of notice, mind.

40:56.180 --> 41:00.253
- I've always fancied Blackpool.
- No more shagging in your storeroom.

41:00.340 --> 41:03.059
Me fuckin' nerves couldn't take it.
Seen me bruises?

41:09.940 --> 41:13.330
Mum. We've cleared out her stuff.

41:13.420 --> 41:16.457
And rang round the family.

41:16.540 --> 41:20.613
Apparently she left all her savings
to you. About two grand.

41:20.700 --> 41:22.930
Hey, good old Joan!

41:23.020 --> 41:25.329
Wasn't so bad after all, was she?

41:25.420 --> 41:27.980
Funeral costs more than that.

41:28.060 --> 41:33.259
Oh, well, come and die at Frank's house!
Free fuckin' funerals all round.

41:38.940 --> 41:43.092
I've invited Fiona Clark, the Smith girls...

41:43.180 --> 41:45.455
Got something for you.

41:45.540 --> 41:48.054
Where the fuck?

41:48.140 --> 41:49.289
Wasn't easy.

41:54.460 --> 41:57.452
Four cars. That's...

41:57.540 --> 42:00.054
300 you owe me.
Is that mine there?

42:00.140 --> 42:01.095
In your fucking dreams.

42:01.180 --> 42:01.578
Listen...

42:01.660 --> 42:05.414
Yes, officer, I can identify
the men who stole the cars.

42:05.500 --> 42:10.335
I think they're on probation. Does that mean
they'll go to prison for a really long time?

42:11.860 --> 42:13.976
Well done.

42:14.060 --> 42:16.415
What the fuck are you
gonna do with 300 quid?

42:16.500 --> 42:18.138
I've got a few ideas.

42:27.820 --> 42:29.856
- Never wanted a fucking party anyway...
- I did!

42:29.940 --> 42:31.373
Shut up. >

42:38.180 --> 42:40.978
LAUGHTER

42:41.060 --> 42:42.015
So...

42:42.100 --> 42:46.093
Come on, here's to Joan.

42:48.620 --> 42:50.292
She may have been...

42:52.860 --> 42:54.896
...you know, an old bitch...

42:56.700 --> 42:58.691
...but...

42:58.780 --> 43:03.058
she's where your mum comes from.

43:03.140 --> 43:04.653
Oh, Frank...

43:04.740 --> 43:05.968
(AIl) To Joan.

43:08.980 --> 43:10.698
To Mum.

43:12.540 --> 43:16.010
I must say, Frank. I'm quite surprised
she never come on to you.

43:16.100 --> 43:18.773
She did to all my other boyfriends.

43:20.260 --> 43:26.335
Well, maybe she saw
that we had something special.

43:26.420 --> 43:27.933
Yeah.

43:30.340 --> 43:33.218
We know different, don't we, Frank?

43:33.300 --> 43:34.779
You and Joan.

43:42.620 --> 43:44.576
You sure you're OK, Mum?

43:44.660 --> 43:46.776
Yeah. Thanks, Debbie, love.

43:46.860 --> 43:50.170
That was a nice gesture,
giving her the blanket.

43:50.260 --> 43:54.139
Not really. Didn't like it.
Don't make us another one, eh?

43:55.740 --> 44:00.256
(Monica) 'Norma always says,
"Biology is not destiny".

44:00.340 --> 44:01.932
