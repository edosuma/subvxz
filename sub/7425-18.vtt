00:02.826 --> 00:04.593
I only thing I am sorry about

00:04.694 --> 00:06.595
is that things
didn't work out between us.

00:06.696 --> 00:09.632
I won't let him hurt you.

00:09.733 --> 00:10.766
Vincent Keller?
Yeah.

00:10.867 --> 00:12.234
You're under arrest.
- Arrest?

00:12.335 --> 00:14.736
For what?
For the murder of Curt Windsor.

00:14.837 --> 00:16.303
Vincent instigated
a fight in jail

00:16.406 --> 00:18.106
<i>in order to get transferred</i>
<i>and escape.</i>

00:19.842 --> 00:21.809
Come on,
we gotta go now,

00:21.911 --> 00:23.512
and maybe we can get out
on the rooftop. Come on.

00:23.612 --> 00:24.679
Vincent, I can't
come with you now.

JT...

00:36.426 --> 00:37.825
JT, where are you?

00:37.927 --> 00:39.327
No. No. No.

00:39.429 --> 00:42.296
JT. Come on. Hello...!

00:42.397 --> 00:43.765
Get the camel off of me!

00:43.866 --> 00:45.533
Tess?

00:45.634 --> 00:47.669
Yes, it's Tess. Here.

00:47.770 --> 00:50.972
Scotch, gummy worms--
JT, really?

00:51.073 --> 00:53.041
How much did you drink
after I left?

00:53.141 --> 00:54.508
I was drowning my sorrows,

00:54.610 --> 00:56.277
generally being
self-destructive.

00:56.378 --> 00:58.579
Okay, well, if it's because
they tried to arrest Vincent

00:58.614 --> 01:00.181
and he bolted, suck it up,
'cause we have to go find him.

01:00.282 --> 01:01.649
Find him,
what do you mean? Why?

01:01.750 --> 01:02.850
'Cause now Cat's gone, too.

01:02.952 --> 01:04.351
What? Ow.

01:05.621 --> 01:07.188
Yeah, I went by
her place this morning

01:07.289 --> 01:08.289
and she wasn't there.

01:08.390 --> 01:10.391
Well, maybe she
went out drinking, too.

01:10.492 --> 01:12.158
And didn't take her purse,
phone or keys?

01:12.259 --> 01:14.360
No way. Plus, there were
signs of a struggle.

01:14.462 --> 01:16.029
She said that there were
people after Vincent;

01:16.130 --> 01:17.211
maybe they
took her instead.

01:17.298 --> 01:18.465
Or maybe she
changed her mind

01:18.566 --> 01:20.734
or maybe
Vincent came back

01:20.835 --> 01:22.168
so they could
run off together,

01:22.269 --> 01:24.137
which, by the way,
is what I thought

01:24.238 --> 01:26.139
they should've done
in the first place,

01:26.240 --> 01:28.081
but nobody asked me--
Okay. But if they didn't,

01:28.109 --> 01:29.476
that means that
Cat is in trouble

01:29.577 --> 01:31.497
and the only person
that can find her is Vincent.

01:31.512 --> 01:33.814
Here.
- Thanks.

01:33.915 --> 01:34.915
Welcome.

01:36.618 --> 01:37.985
Okay, that's enough.
Come on, let's go.

01:38.086 --> 01:40.020
Go where?
- To find Vincent.

01:40.121 --> 01:42.188
You said he had a go bag right?
Cash, cell phones.

01:42.289 --> 01:43.890
Can't you text him or something?
Find out where he is?

01:43.992 --> 01:46.659
Kind of defeats the purpose of
not wanting to be found,

01:46.760 --> 01:47.727
doesn't it?

01:49.262 --> 01:51.563
Unless...
- Unless what?

01:51.665 --> 01:54.900
We did talk about
having a rendezvous point

01:55.002 --> 01:56.442
to make sure Vincent
got away safely.

01:56.536 --> 01:59.505
If... Vincent
remembers and...

01:59.606 --> 02:01.107
is not already in Canada...

02:01.207 --> 02:02.141
Okay. Let's go there.

02:02.242 --> 02:04.409
Close enough.
Let's go. Let's go!

02:06.713 --> 02:07.673
Yes, put those
over here.

02:07.714 --> 02:08.614
All right, Captain.

02:08.715 --> 02:10.282
I'll bring the monitors.
Yes...

02:18.691 --> 02:20.359
Uh... where am I
supposed to work?

02:20.460 --> 02:23.094
Can't you use Lieutenant
Bishop's old office downstairs?

02:23.196 --> 02:24.429
Uh, yeah.
But for how long?

02:24.531 --> 02:26.131
This could take
days, weeks.

02:26.232 --> 02:29.901
I doubt it, not with all the
resources the DA's authorized.

02:30.002 --> 02:32.137
Keller's an alleged
murderer, escapee--

02:32.238 --> 02:34.706
the D.A. wants him caught fast,
before anybody else gets hurt.

02:34.807 --> 02:36.074
Well, fine,
but why are you coordinating

02:36.176 --> 02:37.608
everything from here?
Why not the DA's office?

02:37.710 --> 02:40.211
Because the DA wants us working
side-by-side on this,

02:40.312 --> 02:41.279
he doesn't want anything
slipping through the cracks.

02:41.380 --> 02:43.481
Look, Captain,

02:43.582 --> 02:45.717
I don't like this any better
than you do, okay?

02:45.818 --> 02:47.979
But the DA, the mayor, everybody
wants this guy caught,

02:47.987 --> 02:49.487
so, the sooner we can,

02:49.588 --> 02:50.989
the sooner we can all get back
to our lives, all right?

02:51.090 --> 02:53.457
Understood.

02:53.559 --> 02:54.993
Good. Now, we need
everybody not working

02:55.094 --> 02:56.127
pressing cases on this--

02:56.228 --> 02:58.129
brass, uniforms,
investigators.

02:58.230 --> 03:00.098
Has Detective Chandler
checked in yet?

03:00.199 --> 03:01.566
No. But she should have by now.

03:01.667 --> 03:03.301
I'll go track her down.
Uh, no. I will.

03:03.402 --> 03:04.635
Just make sure you
get that room up and running

03:04.737 --> 03:05.636
as fast as possible.

03:05.738 --> 03:08.806
I'll let you know
when I find her.

03:32.197 --> 03:33.197
Help!

03:35.700 --> 03:38.702
That was a special number three,
hold the sausage.

04:05.729 --> 04:07.463
I was hoping you would show.

04:07.564 --> 04:09.331
I was hoping you remembered.

04:09.432 --> 04:11.567
You didn't say good-bye.

04:11.668 --> 04:13.469
I thought you didn't
like good-byes.

04:13.570 --> 04:15.804
I don't, but still...

04:15.905 --> 04:16.971
after everything
we've been through?

04:17.072 --> 04:18.707
I know, man, I'm sorry.

04:18.808 --> 04:20.841
I just... I don't know,
it happened so fast.

04:20.942 --> 04:22.478
You know?

04:22.579 --> 04:23.746
Anyway...

04:23.846 --> 04:26.882
glad you're still here.

04:26.983 --> 04:28.250
Yeah.

04:28.351 --> 04:30.986
The thing is,
though, I, uh...

04:31.087 --> 04:33.555
I don't want to run anymore.

04:33.657 --> 04:35.223
I don't know what
I was thinking, man.

04:35.324 --> 04:36.892
I can't just leave
Catherine behind like that.

04:36.993 --> 04:38.994
See? That's what I thought;
that's what I just told Tess.

04:39.095 --> 04:41.229
Tess what?

04:41.330 --> 04:43.298
What...

04:44.867 --> 04:46.168
Are you out of your mind?

04:46.269 --> 04:47.269
What is she doing here?

04:49.305 --> 04:50.872
Please tell me
you know where Cat is.

04:50.973 --> 04:52.274
What do you mean?
What's wrong?

04:52.374 --> 04:54.876
Well, she's not with you,
she's missing,

04:54.977 --> 04:56.377
that's what's wrong--
Missing?

04:56.478 --> 04:57.638
What the hell does that mean?

04:57.713 --> 04:59.915
She's missing.
We gotta find her then.

05:00.016 --> 05:01.283
No, Vincent...

05:01.383 --> 05:02.750
- Excuse me, hon.
- Sit down.

05:04.619 --> 05:06.620
You're a fugitive, remember?

05:06.721 --> 05:08.689
You can't just bulldoze your way
back to the city.

05:08.790 --> 05:10.457
Half of New York is
looking for you, for God's sake.

05:10.558 --> 05:12.259
Besides,

05:12.360 --> 05:14.195
it's not just your ass
on the line here.

05:14.296 --> 05:16.030
I'm a cop;
I should be arresting you,

05:16.131 --> 05:17.865
not protecting you.

05:17.966 --> 05:19.433
Right, which is why
it's important all of us

05:19.534 --> 05:21.035
keep our emotions in check.

05:21.136 --> 05:22.102
Especially you, pal;

05:22.204 --> 05:23.737
especially when
it comes to Cat.

05:23.839 --> 05:25.639
No glowing eyes.
Breathe.

05:25.740 --> 05:26.974
Fine. Okay.
Just talk to me.

05:27.075 --> 05:29.609
There's not much
to tell.

05:29.711 --> 05:30.792
Yeah. Whoever grabbed her--

05:30.846 --> 05:32.126
We don't know she was "grabbed."

05:32.147 --> 05:33.613
She didn't just vanish
into thin air.

05:33.715 --> 05:35.615
Okay. When was the last time
that she was seen?

05:35.717 --> 05:37.283
Probably at...

05:37.384 --> 05:39.752
her apartment...
with you.

05:41.021 --> 05:42.588
You have to go
back there, Vincent.

05:42.689 --> 05:43.890
You have to track her.

05:43.991 --> 05:46.726
Yeah, except police
have her place surrounded.

05:46.827 --> 05:48.827
How's he even gonna
get in there to start tracking?

06:10.183 --> 06:12.084
Freeze! NYPD.

06:12.185 --> 06:13.285
JT?

06:15.188 --> 06:16.488
What are you doing here?

06:16.589 --> 06:19.091
Me? How about you,
what are you doing here?

06:19.192 --> 06:20.926
I'm looking for Catherine.

06:21.027 --> 06:22.094
She with Vincent?

06:22.195 --> 06:24.429
Vincent? Vincent who?

06:24.530 --> 06:27.299
Come on, JT, I am not the bad
guy here and I am not the one

06:27.400 --> 06:28.666
who escaped from prison.

06:28.768 --> 06:30.035
That is all on Vincent.

06:30.136 --> 06:31.176
I'm just following orders.

06:31.271 --> 06:32.304
Right.

06:32.405 --> 06:34.273
Why'd you use
the fire escape

06:34.374 --> 06:35.507
instead of the front door
to come in?

06:35.608 --> 06:36.674
Didn't have a key.

06:43.548 --> 06:45.383
Come on, JT.
Don't make me do this.

06:45.483 --> 06:47.218
Don't make it harder
than it has to be.

06:47.319 --> 06:48.819
For everyone's sake,

06:48.921 --> 06:51.155
including Vincent's,
just tell me where he is.

06:53.125 --> 06:55.059
Vincent who?

06:56.561 --> 06:58.662
Take him away, fellas.

07:52.383 --> 07:53.616
Nice try.

07:53.717 --> 07:56.252
Don't move.

07:56.354 --> 07:58.188
Do yourself a favor,
walk away,

07:58.289 --> 08:00.590
because I do not
have time for you right now.

08:00.691 --> 08:02.192
At least
let Catherine go.

08:02.293 --> 08:05.061
I never meant for her
to get caught up in this.

08:05.162 --> 08:06.963
What do you mean,

08:07.064 --> 08:09.232
you "never meant for her
to get caught up in this"?

08:11.168 --> 08:12.402
You ratted me out, didn't you?

08:12.503 --> 08:13.569
You called SWAT.

08:14.905 --> 08:16.239
Yeah.

08:17.508 --> 08:18.941
You son of a bitch.

08:19.043 --> 08:21.211
I only wanted this to end
before someone got hurt.

08:21.312 --> 08:22.745
I trusted you.

08:22.846 --> 08:25.415
Catherine trusted you.

08:25.516 --> 08:27.050
So what,
you gonna kill me now?

08:27.151 --> 08:29.151
Prove to the whole world
how dangerous you really are?

08:29.252 --> 08:30.333
Why you need to be stopped?

08:30.353 --> 08:32.654
I covered for you, Vincent.

08:32.755 --> 08:35.323
Not for you, for Cat,
but no more.

08:35.424 --> 08:38.059
And you got nowhere to run
and no place to hide,

08:38.160 --> 08:41.929
because they will find you,
I will find you.

08:42.032 --> 08:44.033
I will not let you destroy
Catherine's life.

You really willing
to go to jail for this?

09:06.760 --> 09:08.891
Why? What'd I do?
Cut the crap, JT.

09:08.892 --> 09:10.932
We both know you were acting
as a decoy for Vincent.

09:10.959 --> 09:13.294
Only, you ended up

09:13.395 --> 09:14.862
getting caught
instead of him.

09:14.963 --> 09:16.297
Nice friend, huh?

09:16.398 --> 09:19.033
Seriously, trying to
turn me against Vincent?

09:19.134 --> 09:21.569
I'm just saying,
you're in here and he isn't.

09:21.670 --> 09:23.704
Look, JT, don't be stupid.

09:23.806 --> 09:26.140
I get loyalty and friendship,
but this is different.

09:26.241 --> 09:28.709
Vincent is a fugitive
accused of murder.

09:28.811 --> 09:30.878
A murder he didn't commit!
The hell he didn't!

09:30.979 --> 09:32.112
It was self-defense,
you know it!

09:32.213 --> 09:33.414
So, he busts out of jail?

09:33.515 --> 09:34.549
Because he was framed!

09:34.650 --> 09:36.283
It makes him look guilty!

09:36.384 --> 09:40.855
Look, if you know where he is,
you better tell me-- now.

09:44.693 --> 09:45.959
You charging him
with something?

09:46.060 --> 09:47.727
Tess, do you mind?
'Cause if you're not,

09:47.829 --> 09:49.329
you need to
release him right now.

09:49.430 --> 09:51.798
I'm sure I don't have to
remind you that probable cause

09:51.899 --> 09:53.600
requires hard facts,
not just suspicion.

09:55.235 --> 09:56.803
So, what's is gonna be?

10:01.676 --> 10:03.577
Okay. You're free to go.

10:03.678 --> 10:04.978
For now.

10:07.381 --> 10:09.182
Keep tracking.

10:12.687 --> 10:14.454
Do you even realize
how serious this is?

10:14.555 --> 10:16.189
This isn't a game, Tess.

10:16.290 --> 10:17.958
This whole thing has gotten
way out of control.

10:18.058 --> 10:20.025
Thanks to you.
- I am not the one on trial here.

10:20.126 --> 10:23.362
And so, what, now you're
the-the paragon of justice?

10:23.463 --> 10:25.698
After everything you used to do?
Give me a break.

10:25.799 --> 10:27.366
We both know
you're just doing this,

10:27.467 --> 10:28.788
'cause Cat chose Vincent
over you.

10:30.804 --> 10:32.170
Look...

10:32.271 --> 10:33.772
you believe what you want.

10:33.874 --> 10:35.808
But we both know
who Vincent really is,

10:35.909 --> 10:38.811
what he is capable of
and that is a bad thing...

10:38.912 --> 10:39.912
and it has to be stopped.

10:39.980 --> 10:42.481
By you?
By all of us, Detective.

10:42.582 --> 10:45.283
Personal thoughts aside,
we are sworn to uphold the law.

10:45.385 --> 10:46.619
Whether we like it or not,

10:46.720 --> 10:49.254
that is our job,
that is <i>your</i> job.

10:51.224 --> 10:53.191
We are way past the
point of no return here, Tess.

10:53.292 --> 10:55.694
This thing is gonna blow up
on Vincent and soon.

10:55.795 --> 10:58.731
Which means
you need to pick a side.

10:58.832 --> 10:59.831
So does Catherine.

11:23.289 --> 11:25.357
Sorry about all this.

11:25.458 --> 11:28.026
We tried to get here sooner,
but we had a crisis situation.

11:33.132 --> 11:35.199
I'm Special Agent
Henry Knox, FBI.

11:35.300 --> 11:36.367
This is Agent Jay Bates.

11:37.702 --> 11:39.103
Right.

11:40.872 --> 11:42.540
Look, I know
this is unorthodox--

11:42.640 --> 11:44.108
What's going on?
Who are you, really?

11:44.209 --> 11:46.777
We're FBI.

11:46.878 --> 11:48.946
Since when do FBI
kidnap cops?

11:49.047 --> 11:50.247
That was by necessity.

11:50.348 --> 11:52.683
The NYPD was swarming
all over your place

11:52.784 --> 11:53.884
by the time we got there--
look...

11:53.985 --> 11:55.686
you're just gonna
have to trust me,

11:55.787 --> 11:57.788
because time is of the essence
and I really need your help.

11:57.889 --> 11:59.223
Screw you.

12:01.960 --> 12:04.128
Is this the "trust"
you were talking about?

12:04.229 --> 12:05.396
We don't have time
for this, Detective!

12:05.497 --> 12:07.264
I've got an
undercover agent,

12:07.365 --> 12:09.266
who was just taken
by the terrorist group

12:09.367 --> 12:10.934
she was investigating.

12:11.035 --> 12:13.304
And if I don't find her before
they smuggle her off the island,

12:13.405 --> 12:15.473
they're going to kill her,
do you understand?

12:15.574 --> 12:17.640
After they torture her,
to burn other agents,

12:17.741 --> 12:20.076
so I need to move now.

12:20.177 --> 12:22.212
If that's true,
I'm sorry.

12:22.313 --> 12:24.247
But if you had any idea
how many times

12:24.348 --> 12:25.715
I'd been lied to by the FBI--

12:25.816 --> 12:27.950
I do know.
Agent Landon told me.

12:28.051 --> 12:29.752
Dana?

12:29.853 --> 12:31.121
Yeah.

12:31.222 --> 12:32.388
She was the one
that suggested

12:32.490 --> 12:34.056
that you might
be able to help me--

12:34.158 --> 12:35.079
you and Vincent Keller.

12:35.159 --> 12:37.927
I know he's a fugitive,

12:38.028 --> 12:39.962
but if Dana says that
I can trust him,

12:40.063 --> 12:41.097
that's all I care about.

12:41.198 --> 12:42.298
What else did she say about him?

12:42.399 --> 12:45.168
She said that you two might be
my only chance.

12:47.538 --> 12:49.506
So...

12:49.607 --> 12:51.374
you know where Keller is?

12:52.709 --> 12:54.844
Aw, gee...

12:54.945 --> 12:56.479
just when I was starting
to believe your sob story.

12:56.580 --> 12:58.181
Wait, not to arrest him.
I'm out of here.

12:58.282 --> 12:59.682
You can't leave.
Try and stop me.

12:59.783 --> 13:01.283
What if I can
get Vincent exonerated?

13:15.031 --> 13:16.198
Would've saved
a lot of time

13:16.299 --> 13:17.866
if you'd let me
kick the door down.

13:17.967 --> 13:19.201
Right, but we're trying

13:19.302 --> 13:21.138
not to attract attention,
remember?

13:21.139 --> 13:21.639
Yeah, right.

13:21.664 --> 13:23.238
Especially since we just
broke into Gabe's apartment.

13:23.239 --> 13:25.274
You know, I can't believe
Gabe was the one

13:25.375 --> 13:26.975
who called the cops on me.

13:27.076 --> 13:28.777
I should've ripped
his little head off

13:28.878 --> 13:30.845
right then and there.
Another bad idea.

13:30.946 --> 13:32.147
Look, Vincent,
we talked about this.

13:32.248 --> 13:33.448
You got to control yourself.

13:33.550 --> 13:35.849
You can't rip anybody's
head off right now.

13:35.950 --> 13:37.218
Especially not the guy
who's leading the posse.

13:38.720 --> 13:40.020
Let's just concentrate on
finding Cat.

13:40.121 --> 13:42.490
Okay.
Explain to me again how

13:42.591 --> 13:44.392
hacking into his computer
is gonna to do that.

13:44.459 --> 13:47.662
Surveillance cameras are
all over the city, right?

13:47.762 --> 13:50.198
And he's got police access
to all of them, which means,

13:50.299 --> 13:51.732
when he gets an alert
you've been spotted,

13:51.833 --> 13:53.334
I need to get
that alert too, so--

13:53.435 --> 13:55.670
You can warn me.
So you can find Cat.

13:59.241 --> 14:01.209
You know, buddy,

14:01.310 --> 14:03.244
this is really going
above and beyond

14:03.345 --> 14:04.844
the call of duty.

14:04.945 --> 14:05.978
Getting arrested,

14:06.080 --> 14:07.247
breaking into an ADA's
apartment...

14:07.348 --> 14:08.248
into his computer.

14:08.349 --> 14:10.417
Maybe we should, uh,

14:10.518 --> 14:12.752
reevaluate just how much risk
you're taking for me, huh?

14:12.853 --> 14:15.222
What's the alternative,
do nothing?

14:15.323 --> 14:16.603
Let Gabe pervert
the legal system

14:16.624 --> 14:17.757
to keep you and Cat apart?

14:17.858 --> 14:19.192
I don't think so.

14:19.293 --> 14:21.861
Go on, go track Cat,

14:21.962 --> 14:22.895
I've got your back.

14:54.527 --> 14:56.629
Just think about it.

14:56.730 --> 14:58.829
Hey, Knox.

15:14.380 --> 15:16.414
What are you doing here?

15:16.515 --> 15:17.915
You should've been
long gone by now.

15:18.016 --> 15:19.150
Nice to see you, too.

15:19.251 --> 15:20.184
Come on.

15:34.332 --> 15:35.465
Catherine!

15:37.202 --> 15:38.602
Come on, this way.

15:38.703 --> 15:40.304
Hey. Come on. Go. Go.

15:41.840 --> 15:43.174
Okay. What is going on?

15:43.275 --> 15:44.641
They took me last night,
right after you left.

15:44.742 --> 15:45.942
Are you okay?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

15:46.043 --> 15:47.411
All right,
who are these guys?

15:47.512 --> 15:48.612
They claim to be FBI;
I don't trust them.

15:48.713 --> 15:50.514
FBI?

15:52.383 --> 15:53.450
More importantly,

15:53.551 --> 15:54.951
what are you doing
coming back here,

15:55.052 --> 15:56.787
are you out of your mind?
You got kidnapped.

15:56.887 --> 15:58.154
What was I supposed to do,
just keep running?

15:58.255 --> 15:59.589
Yes. Save yourself.

15:59.691 --> 16:00.791
Well, I'm saving you.

16:00.891 --> 16:01.925
I don't need saving.

16:02.026 --> 16:03.026
We've had
this conversation, Vincent--

16:03.127 --> 16:05.261
you need to
think about you, not me.

16:07.064 --> 16:08.632
Look, man, not now, okay?

16:08.733 --> 16:10.300
Look up, ten o'clock high.

16:11.602 --> 16:12.969
Oh, no.

16:13.070 --> 16:14.838
Just got the alert,
which means Gabe did too.

16:16.207 --> 16:18.107
Get out of there, now.
Come on.

16:25.111 --> 16:26.611
Where did they go?

16:26.713 --> 16:28.246
Think concentric circles.

16:28.348 --> 16:29.614
Check all the surrounding
surveillance cameras,

16:29.716 --> 16:30.816
we got to follow them.

16:35.688 --> 16:37.856
There!

16:37.957 --> 16:39.257
They're heading north,
narrow your search.

16:42.762 --> 16:43.962
Where are they?

16:44.063 --> 16:45.163
Uh...

16:45.264 --> 16:46.498
I don't know.
They must've found a gap.

16:46.599 --> 16:48.132
He's obviously knows
what he's doing.

16:48.234 --> 16:49.735
Damn it.
Keep looking.

16:56.641 --> 16:58.642
Did you know Catherine
was with him?

16:58.744 --> 16:59.777
No. I didn't.

16:59.878 --> 17:00.878
Have you heard from her?

17:00.979 --> 17:03.046
No, I haven't. I swear.

17:03.147 --> 17:04.281
I can't protect her, Tess.

17:04.383 --> 17:05.549
I can't protect you, either.

17:05.650 --> 17:06.684
It's not my call anymore.

17:06.785 --> 17:08.117
And what the hell is she doing?

17:08.219 --> 17:09.739
She's gonna
get herself fired or worse.

17:11.490 --> 17:13.723
Maybe I can still spin this,
say Vincent...

17:13.825 --> 17:15.459
kidnapped her.

17:15.560 --> 17:17.721
But not if she keeps getting
caught on camera with him.

17:19.964 --> 17:21.699
Find her, Tess,
talk to her.

17:21.800 --> 17:22.833
Tell her she's
running out of time.

17:22.934 --> 17:23.867
Tell her we all are.

17:23.968 --> 17:26.002
You understand?

17:26.104 --> 17:28.005
Yeah.

17:36.414 --> 17:37.495
Tess isn't taking my calls.

17:37.581 --> 17:38.648
What's up with that?

17:38.749 --> 17:39.883
I don't know;
maybe it's not safe.

17:39.983 --> 17:41.551
Maybe...
Gabe is watching her.

17:41.652 --> 17:43.586
Still, I've
called her six times

17:43.687 --> 17:45.321
and texted her twice;
you think she'd find a way. Th--

17:45.423 --> 17:46.989
Something's not right.

17:47.090 --> 17:49.025
All the more reason to
get you out of here and fast.

17:49.126 --> 17:50.493
Except, without WiFi,
I can't get any alerts,

17:50.594 --> 17:52.495
which means we need
Tess's help

17:52.596 --> 17:54.096
to avoid surveillance.

17:54.197 --> 17:56.165
I still can't believe Gabe
is responsible for all this.

17:56.266 --> 17:57.767
Oh, I can believe it.

17:57.868 --> 18:00.036
The guy warned me several times
to stay away from you.

18:00.137 --> 18:01.671
He thinks I'm some
menace to society,

18:01.772 --> 18:03.540
so why not jump on
the fugitive bandwagon?

18:03.641 --> 18:04.741
It doesn't change anything.

18:04.842 --> 18:05.909
We have to get you
back on the run.

18:07.710 --> 18:08.944
What if I don't want to?

18:09.045 --> 18:10.746
What are you talking about?

18:13.783 --> 18:15.551
JT, can you try and get
a connection on this thing?

18:15.652 --> 18:17.453
Yeah. Sure.

18:20.957 --> 18:22.558
What's going on?

18:22.659 --> 18:24.693
Look, I, uh...

18:24.794 --> 18:26.474
I've been doing
a lot of thinking lately...

18:26.529 --> 18:28.129
Vincent, you can't stay;
it's too dangerous.

18:28.230 --> 18:30.198
Let me finish... okay?

18:30.299 --> 18:32.468
I started to run, I did,
but the more I ran,

18:32.569 --> 18:34.369
the more I thought about it,
the less I liked it.

18:34.471 --> 18:36.872
Come on, you gotta admit,
it was a rash decision, right?

18:36.973 --> 18:39.441
The helicopters were circling,
they were about to barge in;

18:39.542 --> 18:41.477
we didn't even get a chance to
think things through properly--

18:41.578 --> 18:42.811
What was there
to think about?

18:42.912 --> 18:44.279
They would have
caught you again,

18:44.380 --> 18:45.313
you would have gone to jail
and then what?

18:45.414 --> 18:46.949
I don't know, okay?

18:47.049 --> 18:49.551
I don't, but what I do know
is that we worked so hard

18:49.652 --> 18:50.986
to get back together again
and now we're just, what,

18:51.087 --> 18:52.487
gonna split up again?

18:52.588 --> 18:55.122
Come on, you keep saying
we've got to move forward...

18:55.223 --> 18:57.303
I just don't think you're being
realistic about this.

18:57.392 --> 19:00.461
Half the city is out there
looking for you right now...

19:00.562 --> 19:01.929
and since Gabe's
not on our side anymore,

19:02.030 --> 19:03.598
I think that
we have to think about

19:03.699 --> 19:04.932
what's best for
you, not us.

19:06.735 --> 19:08.636
We don't have any other choice.

19:08.737 --> 19:11.472
What about this Agent Knox?

19:11.573 --> 19:13.173
What about him?

19:13.274 --> 19:14.509
Well, you said that
he was willing to

19:14.610 --> 19:16.143
exonerate me, right?
If we helped him out?

19:16.244 --> 19:17.745
We're gonna trust the FBI now?

19:17.846 --> 19:19.146
After everything
they've put us through,

19:19.247 --> 19:20.447
how many times
they've tried to kill us.

19:20.549 --> 19:21.983
Come on, Dana vouched for us.

19:22.083 --> 19:23.518
No. <i>He</i> said Dana did.
And that was

19:23.619 --> 19:25.579
right before he asked me
if I knew where you were,

19:25.621 --> 19:26.687
which, I'm assuming,
is the only thing

19:26.788 --> 19:27.822
he really cares about.

19:27.923 --> 19:29.590
Vincent, we will
be together.

19:29.691 --> 19:32.426
I promise you
we'll find a way.

19:32.528 --> 19:34.261
But right now,
the most important thing is

19:34.362 --> 19:36.831
that we get you out of here
before it's too late.

19:54.149 --> 19:55.782
Are you all right?

19:55.883 --> 19:57.217
Define "all right."

19:57.318 --> 19:58.485
Where are you?

19:58.586 --> 19:59.886
I'd rather not say.

19:59.987 --> 20:01.955
That way if Gabe asks,
you don't have to lie.

20:02.057 --> 20:04.458
What, are you kidding?
That's all I've been doing.

20:04.559 --> 20:06.218
Cat, this is getting
way out of control.

20:06.243 --> 20:07.061
I know.

20:07.062 --> 20:09.263
Do you really? 'Cause now
the police aren't only looking

20:09.264 --> 20:11.231
for Vincent anymore--
we're looking for you now, too.

20:11.332 --> 20:12.332
"We"?

20:12.434 --> 20:14.000
You know what I mean.

20:14.102 --> 20:15.502
What are you gonna do?

20:15.603 --> 20:17.336
Well, I'm gonna get Vincent
out of the city,

20:17.438 --> 20:18.871
but I need your help to do that.

20:18.972 --> 20:22.041
So call me if anybody spots him

20:22.142 --> 20:26.045
and then we can navigate
around the surveillance.

20:26.146 --> 20:28.181
Tess?

20:29.649 --> 20:31.817
Cat, how far are you willing
to go with this?

20:31.918 --> 20:33.553
I'm not gonna let Vincent
get caught,

20:33.653 --> 20:35.188
if that's what you're asking.

20:35.289 --> 20:38.191
Look, I care about Vincent,
too-- you know that--

20:38.292 --> 20:40.326
but the truth is
I care about you more.

20:40.427 --> 20:41.994
And you're gonna be
in serious trouble,

20:42.096 --> 20:44.597
maybe even go to prison,
but Gabe says

20:44.698 --> 20:47.700
that if you stop right now,
he may be able to save you.

20:47.801 --> 20:49.835
Wait, Gabe?
You're trusting Gabe now?

20:49.936 --> 20:51.504
When it comes to you, yes.

20:51.605 --> 20:53.339
Whose side are you on?

20:53.440 --> 20:55.774
I'm on your side, Cat.

20:55.875 --> 20:58.510
Look, I just want this to end,
all right?

20:58.611 --> 21:00.445
Before it bites us all
in the ass.

21:07.019 --> 21:08.520
A task force has been formed

21:08.621 --> 21:11.289
and the DA's Office
is coordinating

21:11.390 --> 21:13.425
NYPD, the Port Authority

21:13.526 --> 21:14.959
and the Marshal's Office

21:15.060 --> 21:16.894
to capture the fugitive
Vincent Keller.

21:16.996 --> 21:18.563
You believe this guy?
A couple of weeks ago,

21:18.664 --> 21:19.864
we were all working
together, and now...

21:19.965 --> 21:22.066
Now all bets are off.

21:22.168 --> 21:23.535
I want to assure the public

21:23.636 --> 21:25.270
that everything is being done
that can be done,

21:25.371 --> 21:26.971
but at the same time,
people need to be alert

21:27.072 --> 21:30.708
because Vincent Keller is
considered armed and dangerous.

21:30.809 --> 21:32.576
Wait, is that Tess?

21:32.678 --> 21:34.211
What the hell?

21:34.312 --> 21:36.313
Oh, good, you got
an Internet connection.

21:36.414 --> 21:38.249
No, bad, because look.

21:38.350 --> 21:39.717
Our goal is to pin him down,

21:39.818 --> 21:41.285
contain him
so he has nowhere to run,

21:41.386 --> 21:43.154
which is why we have
every bridge,

21:43.255 --> 21:45.222
tunnel and subway line covered.

21:45.323 --> 21:47.224
If you see...
- All right, I've seen enough.

21:47.325 --> 21:48.442
Yeah, me, too.

21:48.467 --> 21:49.727
Tess said she can help,
but we need to hurry.

21:49.728 --> 21:50.962
Wait, she took your call

21:51.063 --> 21:52.496
but not mine?
Do you mind?

21:52.597 --> 21:54.932
Sorry. Carry on.
No, I'm done.

21:55.034 --> 21:56.000
I'm done running.

21:56.101 --> 21:57.434
Vincent...
Catherine, come on.

21:57.536 --> 21:58.803
You can go your own way.

21:58.904 --> 22:00.304
For your sake, you can.

22:00.405 --> 22:02.173
I will get it.
I would, but...

22:02.274 --> 22:03.340
I'm done running, okay?

22:03.441 --> 22:04.775
From your father, from Gabe,

22:04.876 --> 22:06.677
from anyone who tries
to keep us apart.

22:06.778 --> 22:09.245
Look, like it or not,
we are in this together

22:09.346 --> 22:10.647
We always have been,

22:10.748 --> 22:12.115
and there is always someone
after you,

22:12.216 --> 22:13.183
after me, after us.

22:13.284 --> 22:14.951
There is always something,

22:15.053 --> 22:16.987
which means we have to make
a decision once and for all.

22:17.088 --> 22:18.922
Okay, do we

22:19.023 --> 22:21.591
keep running
away from each other,

22:21.693 --> 22:23.960
or do we stand and fight?

22:24.062 --> 22:25.829
For us.

22:44.716 --> 22:46.983
I'm sorry I hit you in the face
with a chair.

22:54.402 --> 22:56.603
Why'd you come back?
What changed your mind?

22:57.406 --> 22:58.605
He did.

22:58.706 --> 23:00.307
Although, before we agree
to anything,

23:00.409 --> 23:01.875
I need to ask you a question,

23:01.976 --> 23:05.513
and I'm warning you,
please, do not lie to me.

23:05.613 --> 23:07.448
Because...

23:07.549 --> 23:09.250
Well, just-just don't lie, okay?

23:10.985 --> 23:12.886
Did one
of your undercover agents

23:12.987 --> 23:15.022
really get captured?

23:16.758 --> 23:19.160
Yes.

23:20.429 --> 23:21.895
Yeah.

23:23.231 --> 23:24.365
We have a winner.

23:24.466 --> 23:25.599
Okay.
- Okay.

23:29.271 --> 23:30.670
Is this her? Karen Mallory?

23:30.771 --> 23:33.039
Yeah, she was working
a sleeper cell,

23:33.140 --> 23:35.016
uncovering a terrorist plot
before she was taken.

23:35.017 --> 23:35.571
By who? When?

23:35.576 --> 23:37.710
Last night
by a Bultivan Al-Qaeda group.

23:37.811 --> 23:39.879
Then rogue agents, using their
country's good name,

23:39.980 --> 23:41.147
hid her in the UN
before they could

23:41.248 --> 23:42.448
smuggle her out
of the country.

23:42.483 --> 23:44.184
The problem is,
the compound's so huge,

23:44.285 --> 23:45.918
we don't even know where to start.
- Okay, hold up.

23:46.019 --> 23:48.688
You want us to break in
to the United Nations.

23:48.789 --> 23:51.657
Yes, before the General
Assembly adjourns today.

23:51.758 --> 23:53.593
Once they scatter,
she's gone, dead.

23:53.694 --> 23:56.229
Can't the FBI just...
- The UN, it's like an embassy.

23:56.330 --> 23:58.611
It's sovereign territory.
We have no jurisdiction over it.

23:58.665 --> 24:00.766
Okay, let me guess, this isn't
a sanctioned operation, right?

24:00.867 --> 24:03.035
We get caught, then...

24:03.137 --> 24:04.370
You're on your own.

24:04.472 --> 24:06.339
FBI would disavow
any knowledge of it.

24:06.440 --> 24:08.741
Look, obviously,
I'm desperate,

24:08.842 --> 24:10.576
otherwise I wouldn't
be asking you for help.

24:10.676 --> 24:12.411
But, obviously,
you're desperate, too.

24:12.512 --> 24:15.547
No. Not that desperate.
Sorry.

24:17.184 --> 24:18.685
Agent Landon
didn't say why

24:18.786 --> 24:20.854
she thought you might
be able to help me,

24:20.955 --> 24:22.822
other than you're
supposedly good at

24:22.923 --> 24:25.659
tracking people,
and close combat.

24:25.760 --> 24:28.428
What I do know

24:28.529 --> 24:30.264
is that I'm agent
Mallory's only hope.

24:30.365 --> 24:32.766
And I'm your
only hope, too.

24:32.867 --> 24:35.869
Please, I'm running
out of time here.

24:44.111 --> 24:46.280
I want the exoneration
in writing first.

24:46.381 --> 24:47.462
I don't have it in writing.

24:47.548 --> 24:48.782
Then get it.

25:08.035 --> 25:09.568
It's about time.

25:09.670 --> 25:11.938
Why have you been
avoiding me?

25:12.039 --> 25:13.973
Are you kidding me?

25:14.074 --> 25:15.875
I'm trying to protect you.
Gabe's all over me.

25:15.976 --> 25:18.044
If he found out
that I was here--

25:18.145 --> 25:19.145
But we're supposed
to be working together.

25:19.246 --> 25:20.379
We're not gonna be able
to help Vincent...

25:20.480 --> 25:21.814
There is no help for Vincent.

25:23.082 --> 25:24.883
Did he at least
get out of the city?

25:24.984 --> 25:26.651
Cat never called.

25:26.752 --> 25:28.053
No, change of plan.

25:28.154 --> 25:29.221
He and Cat are working
on something,

25:29.322 --> 25:30.989
something that might
get him exonerated.

25:31.090 --> 25:33.591
What?
- Tess, come on, we can do this.

25:33.693 --> 25:34.893
No, we can't, JT.

25:34.994 --> 25:36.461
Gabe's tapped into
every surveillance camera.

25:36.562 --> 25:38.096
He...
the entire city is covered.

25:38.198 --> 25:39.731
There is no way
Vincent's getting out now.

25:39.833 --> 25:42.434
Maybe, maybe not.

25:42.535 --> 25:45.237
Just hear me out, because if we can
pull this off...

25:45.338 --> 25:47.472
I got to go.
Wait, but I have a plan.

25:47.573 --> 25:49.741
It's too late, JT.

25:49.843 --> 25:51.776
Don't do anything stupid.

25:58.283 --> 25:59.984
I'm telling you,
we don't have a choice.

26:00.085 --> 26:02.253
The UN has five buildings,
there are 39 floors

26:02.354 --> 26:03.387
in the East River tower alone.

26:03.488 --> 26:05.089
How else are we gonna
find her in time?

26:05.190 --> 26:07.458
Not by getting you captured,
that's for sure.

26:07.559 --> 26:09.961
Why not? If Knox can get me
into the UN, I can sneak...

26:10.062 --> 26:11.695
So, what, I track you
to Agent Mallory?

26:11.796 --> 26:13.697
And then what if the terrorists
don't even put you in with her?

26:13.798 --> 26:14.866
Where else are they
gonna put me?

26:14.967 --> 26:17.869
Especially if they think
I'm an agent, too?

26:17.970 --> 26:21.038
No, it's too risky.
You have a better idea?

26:21.139 --> 26:23.274
Look, I'm all for us
working together, Vincent,

26:23.375 --> 26:25.843
but let's not kid ourselves.

26:25.944 --> 26:27.611
This isn't an easy way out.

26:27.712 --> 26:29.847
But, all things
considered,

26:29.948 --> 26:31.749
it may be our only way.

26:33.285 --> 26:35.186
All right...

26:35.287 --> 26:36.820
here's your amnesty,

26:36.922 --> 26:39.489
signed by the
Deputy Attorney General himself.

26:41.592 --> 26:44.160
Why's it have
tomorrow's date on it?

26:44.262 --> 26:46.302
'Cause it's not good
until you complete the mission.

26:47.498 --> 26:48.798
DOJ wants their back scratched

26:48.900 --> 26:49.940
before they scratch yours.

26:52.003 --> 26:53.803
Okay, I'm gonna need
a cover to get in,

26:53.905 --> 26:55.805
preferably as an
Bultivan delegate.

26:55.907 --> 26:57.627
I'm assuming the terrorists
will be on alert

26:57.641 --> 26:59.342
and that any rep
will-will trigger them.

26:59.443 --> 27:00.676
That's not a problem.
We're gonna need you

27:00.778 --> 27:03.079
to call the dogs off.

27:03.180 --> 27:04.940
At least long enough
for us to get to the UN.

27:04.982 --> 27:06.216
That, I can't do.

27:06.317 --> 27:07.384
DA's in charge of the manhunt,

27:07.484 --> 27:08.524
it's a local jurisdiction.

27:08.619 --> 27:10.586
Besides, the press
is all over it,

27:10.687 --> 27:12.555
If we pull rank,
they'll smell a rat.

27:12.656 --> 27:14.824
Okay, how do you expect us
to even get into the UN?

27:14.926 --> 27:16.559
The place is covered
in surveillance.

27:16.660 --> 27:19.161
I don't know,
I-I really don't.

27:19.262 --> 27:22.097
But if you can't,
that deal's off.

27:46.824 --> 27:48.223
Hey.

27:48.325 --> 27:49.724
Find anything?

27:49.826 --> 27:50.926
Yeah. Vincent.

27:51.027 --> 27:52.761
Talk to me.

27:52.862 --> 27:54.930
All right, look, don't
ask me how I know,

27:55.031 --> 27:57.232
but I think Vincent's working
on some kind of case.

27:57.334 --> 27:59.068
What case?
- I don't know. Something with

27:59.169 --> 28:02.237
getting him exonerated, maybe.
Exonerated, how?

28:02.339 --> 28:04.373
Okay, doesn't matter.
Did you see him somewhere?

28:04.474 --> 28:06.554
Well, I started thinking
about where he used to hide,

28:06.576 --> 28:08.444
last year, this year, whenever.

28:08.544 --> 28:10.612
So I decided to check
around the Heights area.

28:10.713 --> 28:12.581
The dungeon.
- Yeah, and I spotted him

28:12.682 --> 28:14.083
heading towards
the East River.

28:15.485 --> 28:16.885
There.

28:16.987 --> 28:19.454
That's 95th and First,
four minutes ago.

28:21.523 --> 28:23.691
I'm hoping you'll
protect my friends.

28:49.683 --> 28:51.584
How bad is it?
It's bad.

28:51.685 --> 28:53.820
I counted ten
surveillance cameras,

28:53.921 --> 28:55.122
not including
the hidden ones.

28:55.223 --> 28:56.823
Plus UN security,
plus cop cars,

28:56.924 --> 28:58.925
plus helicopter patrols.
- Piece of cake.

28:59.027 --> 29:00.560
Yeah.

29:02.530 --> 29:03.863
Or you could run.

29:03.964 --> 29:05.931
Catherine...
- I'm not saying that you should,

29:06.033 --> 29:09.135
or that I want you to,
but the odds are pretty bad.

29:09.236 --> 29:11.037
Even if we can
make it across the street,

29:11.138 --> 29:13.605
we still have to get into the
building, then we have to find

29:13.706 --> 29:15.841
Agent Mallory, and then we have
to get her out of the building

29:15.942 --> 29:17.843
without creating
an international incident.

29:17.944 --> 29:20.279
I just think we should know
what we're up against here.

29:20.380 --> 29:23.649
It's a piece of cake.

29:33.725 --> 29:35.660
Vincent!

29:37.329 --> 29:40.198
Let's go, let's go.

29:49.075 --> 29:50.908
I didn't do
anything, I swear.

29:53.612 --> 29:54.845
I told you it would work.

29:54.947 --> 29:56.480
Yeah, well, don't get cocky.

29:56.582 --> 29:58.816
If Gabe can prove that we fed
old surveillance footage

29:58.917 --> 30:01.418
of Vincent into his police
monitors, we're both dead.

30:01.519 --> 30:02.687
Working on it.

30:02.788 --> 30:04.354
He'll never know we tricked him.

30:04.456 --> 30:05.723
And just so you know,

30:05.824 --> 30:07.758
I never doubted you.

30:07.859 --> 30:10.695
Liar.

30:16.267 --> 30:18.602
Well, I really
hope this works.

30:21.339 --> 30:22.573
Just be careful.

30:22.673 --> 30:24.441
I will.

30:41.391 --> 30:43.359
Step forward, please.

30:43.460 --> 30:45.861
Thank you.

30:45.962 --> 30:48.764
Clear?

30:48.865 --> 30:50.666
All right.

31:10.687 --> 31:11.787
We're in.

31:11.888 --> 31:13.555
Now we just have to get out.

31:13.657 --> 31:16.091
At least they won't
see us on camera.

31:34.498 --> 31:35.465
Any idea

31:35.566 --> 31:36.932
which ones are the bad guys?

31:37.033 --> 31:38.934
Well, heartbeats only tell me

31:39.035 --> 31:41.771
if someone's lying,
unfortunately, not evil.

31:41.872 --> 31:44.306
I have no idea
how these guys got

31:44.407 --> 31:45.407
past UN security.

31:45.508 --> 31:46.608
Same way I did, probably.

31:46.709 --> 31:49.245
Used their host countries
as cover.

31:49.345 --> 31:51.947
Except if Knox is right,

31:52.048 --> 31:55.384
the terrorists were alerted
the minute my I.D. was scanned.

31:55.485 --> 31:57.219
They're already after me.

31:57.320 --> 31:59.421
Well, here goes.
No, wait...

31:59.522 --> 32:01.423
What are we gonna do
if they don't put you in

32:01.524 --> 32:02.758
with Agent Mallory?

32:02.859 --> 32:03.980
Well, you will track me down

32:04.060 --> 32:05.427
and get us the hell out of here.

32:05.528 --> 32:07.896
Don't worry,

32:07.997 --> 32:09.564
and don't beast out
to protect me.

32:09.666 --> 32:13.034
We'll never find Mallory
if I don't get caught first.

33:12.994 --> 33:14.328
Who are you?

33:16.597 --> 33:19.833
I'm, uh, here to rescue you.

33:26.607 --> 33:28.075
You lied to me.

33:28.176 --> 33:29.709
I did? How?

33:29.810 --> 33:31.711
Cut the crap, Tess;
I know damn well you did.

33:31.812 --> 33:32.746
I'm gonna bust you for it.

33:32.847 --> 33:34.213
JT, too, if he was involved.

33:34.314 --> 33:35.681
All I have to do is trace
the video feed ba...

33:35.782 --> 33:36.682
And you'll find that it leads

33:36.783 --> 33:37.750
straight to your home computer.

33:37.851 --> 33:39.886
That's right, check it out.

33:39.987 --> 33:41.354
Because if it
incriminates anybody,

33:41.454 --> 33:42.654
it'll incriminate you.

33:42.756 --> 33:43.756
You broke into my apartment?

33:43.857 --> 33:45.091
No, Gabe, I picked a side.

33:46.626 --> 33:48.928
And it wasn't yours.

33:52.866 --> 33:54.166
Wait, you mean

33:54.268 --> 33:56.102
you intentionally
got yourself caught?

33:56.203 --> 33:57.770
That's insane.
Agreed.

33:57.871 --> 33:59.438
You okay? Can you run?

33:59.539 --> 34:00.907
How do I know this isn't
some kind of a trick?

34:01.008 --> 34:02.173
The only trick here,
Agent Mallory

34:02.275 --> 34:03.608
is me trying
to save your life,

34:03.709 --> 34:05.543
and I can't do that
unless you trust me.

34:08.847 --> 34:11.049
Hurry, get away
from the door, quick!

34:13.619 --> 34:14.685
Everybody okay?

34:14.786 --> 34:16.148
Not yet.
We got to get out of here.

34:16.188 --> 34:17.455
Okay, come on.

34:17.556 --> 34:18.924
- Now!
- Come on.

34:25.664 --> 34:27.697
Come on!

34:27.800 --> 34:29.699
What happened?

34:29.802 --> 34:32.235
The UN guards must've seen
Vincent's handiwork.

34:32.337 --> 34:35.072
Come on! Hurry!

34:36.241 --> 34:37.775
I can't hold it much longer!

34:39.710 --> 34:41.344
Run!

34:49.822 --> 34:52.156
This way, this way, this way!

34:54.326 --> 34:55.759
Okay, come on.

34:55.860 --> 34:58.061
Let's go, let's go!

34:58.162 --> 35:00.997
Wait, wait, wait, hold up,
I need to catch my breath.

35:01.098 --> 35:03.099
Come on, we can't
just stay here.

35:03.200 --> 35:05.001
Where are we going?
I don't know, okay?

35:05.102 --> 35:06.102
But you heard Agent Knox.

35:06.203 --> 35:07.170
We get caught, we're on our own,

35:07.271 --> 35:08.505
which means no exoneration.

35:08.606 --> 35:09.973
Okay, I think it's gonna be

35:10.074 --> 35:11.908
worse than that,
especially if you get caught.

35:12.009 --> 35:14.010
Right, so come on.
No, there's nowhere to run to.

35:14.111 --> 35:15.579
There's no way out up
and we can't go

35:15.680 --> 35:17.347
back down, either.
What are you saying?

35:17.448 --> 35:19.082
I'm saying I think
we should split up.

35:19.183 --> 35:21.084
What?
So that you can blur away.

35:21.185 --> 35:23.086
Vincent, listen to me.

35:23.187 --> 35:25.755
There is no "us"
if they put a fugitive

35:25.857 --> 35:29.292
on trial in international court
in front of the entire world.

35:29.393 --> 35:30.594
So unless you can think
of a way to get us

35:30.695 --> 35:31.962
back on American soil and fast,

35:32.062 --> 35:33.096
I don't think
we have another choice.

35:33.197 --> 35:34.764
Catherine, listen to me,

35:34.866 --> 35:36.499
I am not leaving

35:36.600 --> 35:38.368
without you again.

35:38.469 --> 35:39.802
Please.

35:41.705 --> 35:43.306
Where are we going?

35:43.407 --> 35:45.208
Just follow me.

35:51.759 --> 35:52.892
Clear.

35:52.993 --> 35:54.061
Take the hall.

35:56.830 --> 35:57.997
Okay, come on.

36:01.969 --> 36:03.670
Okay, now what?

36:03.771 --> 36:06.669
Okay... now?

36:06.670 --> 36:08.204
Now we jump.

36:08.305 --> 36:09.739
What?

36:09.840 --> 36:11.140
You wanted American soil, right?

36:11.242 --> 36:12.642
There it is.

36:12.743 --> 36:13.876
It's a little wet, maybe,

36:13.977 --> 36:15.978
but it counts, right?

36:16.079 --> 36:17.680
No, you're crazy,
we'll never make that.

36:17.781 --> 36:19.515
I am crazy, but we'll make it.
Come on.

36:20.917 --> 36:22.585
All right,
just trust me, okay?

36:24.421 --> 36:26.461
Okay, streamline the impact,
okay? Arms by the side,

36:26.490 --> 36:27.557
pointed toes, you got it?
Okay.

36:27.658 --> 36:28.591
Okay, hold on!

36:56.052 --> 36:57.153
UN police!
Drop your weapon!

36:58.854 --> 37:01.156
Hands up now!

37:13.169 --> 37:14.102
Thank God.

37:14.203 --> 37:15.771
I was getting worried.

37:15.871 --> 37:16.938
Did Agent Mallory...?

37:17.039 --> 37:19.240
Yes, she's, uh, safe.

37:19.342 --> 37:21.743
I mean, she's a bit
shaken up, of course,

37:21.844 --> 37:23.378
but she'll be okay.
And the UN caught

37:23.479 --> 37:25.113
the last terrorist, too.

37:25.214 --> 37:27.649
I'm more than grateful.

37:27.750 --> 37:30.385
By saving Agent Mallory,
you saved other undercovers

37:30.486 --> 37:33.253
from being exposed
and their operations.

37:33.355 --> 37:36.424
You... you really
came through.

37:36.525 --> 37:38.659
I'm sensing a "but."

37:38.760 --> 37:40.928
Where's the exoneration?

37:41.029 --> 37:44.097
They rescinded it.
What?

37:44.199 --> 37:45.433
I'm sorry.

37:45.534 --> 37:47.267
Believe me, I'm just
as shocked as you are.

37:47.369 --> 37:49.269
You're lying.
- I'm not.

37:49.371 --> 37:50.971
No, he's not.

37:51.072 --> 37:53.774
Look...

37:53.875 --> 37:55.409
I feel like crap.

37:55.510 --> 37:57.010
I mean, you held up
your end of the bargain

37:57.111 --> 37:58.412
and we didn't.

37:58.513 --> 38:00.080
What happened?

38:02.884 --> 38:06.086
All I know is that someone

38:06.187 --> 38:07.788
got the Bureau
of Prisons involved.

38:07.889 --> 38:10.424
Made the case that
because you broke out of jail

38:10.525 --> 38:11.992
that that implied guilt.

38:12.093 --> 38:13.994
That made
the AG change his mind.

38:14.095 --> 38:15.596
I mean, somebody out there

38:15.697 --> 38:17.365
really doesn't like you
very much.

38:30.778 --> 38:32.311
You might want
to clear the room.

38:33.614 --> 38:35.548
Give us the room, guys?

38:48.628 --> 38:49.862
How dare you.

38:49.963 --> 38:51.143
First, you promised
to help Vincent,

38:51.144 --> 38:52.610
and then you try
to get him arrested?

38:52.611 --> 38:53.160
Catherine...

38:53.161 --> 38:55.161
Even though you know damn well
that he's innocent.

38:55.602 --> 38:57.336
But apparently that doesn't
matter to you anymore

38:57.437 --> 38:59.338
because here you are
running a manhunt,

38:59.439 --> 39:00.806
threatening Tess and JT.

39:00.908 --> 39:02.808
W-would you let me talk?
- Talk?

39:02.910 --> 39:04.710
Talk like you talked
to the attorney general

39:04.811 --> 39:06.445
to block Vincent's exoneration?

39:09.249 --> 39:11.750
I trusted you.

39:11.851 --> 39:13.152
I loved you.

39:13.253 --> 39:15.721
I believed that
you had made amends

39:15.822 --> 39:18.090
for all the crap
that you pulled last year,

39:18.191 --> 39:20.559
but you haven't changed at all.

39:20.660 --> 39:22.260
Maybe you're right--

39:22.361 --> 39:25.196
maybe some beasts
only get worse.

39:25.298 --> 39:29.067
Look, I can't change
how you think about me,

39:29.168 --> 39:32.504
but I am not gonna change what
I am doing or why I am doing it.

39:32.605 --> 39:34.907
Vincent is a criminal and,
make no mistake about it,

39:35.007 --> 39:37.409
I will do whatever it
takes to destroy him.

39:38.778 --> 39:40.712
"Destroy him"?

39:42.281 --> 39:44.450
Don't you mean "arrest him"?

39:51.691 --> 39:55.260
♪ My cold heart

39:55.361 --> 40:00.365

40:08.140 --> 40:11.542

40:11.643 --> 40:13.211
Hey.

40:13.312 --> 40:16.047
You sure it's safe
for you up here?

40:16.148 --> 40:19.117
Probably not,
but where is now?

40:20.519 --> 40:22.253
At least I can jump.

40:22.355 --> 40:23.821
Well, I mean...

40:23.922 --> 40:25.723
jump and keep running.

40:25.824 --> 40:28.459
I thought you said
no more running.

40:28.559 --> 40:31.595
At least, not separately,
not anymore.

40:34.332 --> 40:35.932
Are you sure?

40:38.370 --> 40:41.671
Because you know
that I am nothing but trouble.

40:41.772 --> 40:43.340
Yes.

40:43.441 --> 40:45.175
In fact, I do know that.

40:47.445 --> 40:48.612
What?

40:48.713 --> 40:50.947
I don't know. It's...

40:51.049 --> 40:55.152
it's... I can't believe we're,
like, back to where we started.

40:55.253 --> 40:57.988
Me hiding in the shadows.
You hiding me.

40:58.089 --> 41:00.657
At least it's romantic.

41:02.727 --> 41:05.162
Stolen moments, secret love.

41:05.263 --> 41:07.498
Still, it's no future.

41:07.598 --> 41:11.601
And I think we
deserve a future.

41:11.702 --> 41:13.703
We'll have one, I promise.

41:15.806 --> 41:17.607
Together.
