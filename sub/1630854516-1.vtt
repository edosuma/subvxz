00:46.413 --> 00:49.551
-The Wrath of the Erinys,

00:49.551 --> 00:53.862
punisher of men for crimes
against the natural order,

00:53.862 --> 00:57.413
goddesses of Vengeance
and retribution in Greek

00:57.413 --> 00:59.655
and Roman mythology.

00:59.655 --> 01:03.310
Summoned by victims
seeking justice

01:03.310 --> 01:06.068
pursuers and tormentors
of the wicked

01:06.068 --> 01:08.758
until they atone
for their crimes.

01:08.758 --> 01:11.206
From the blood that spilled on
the earth during

01:11.206 --> 01:13.758
the castration of
the god Uranus,

01:13.758 --> 01:17.068
the Erinys were born.

01:17.068 --> 01:20.344
Megaera the grudging.

01:20.344 --> 01:23.551
Alecto the unceasing.

01:23.551 --> 01:28.793
And Tisiphone,
punisher of murderers.

01:28.793 --> 01:30.724
Gentlemen, I encourage you

01:30.724 --> 01:32.827
to be on your best behavior
around them.

01:34.413 --> 01:37.793
A few reminders before
we start the evening's bidding.

01:37.793 --> 01:40.827
All sales are conducted
in US dollars.

01:40.827 --> 01:42.103
Everything is being sold

01:42.103 --> 01:43.586
according to
the conditions of sale.

01:43.586 --> 01:46.206
And I draw particular attention
to article one,

01:46.206 --> 01:47.655
which states that everything
is sold

01:47.655 --> 01:51.620
under the terms of guaranty
on an as-is basis.

01:51.620 --> 01:53.482
Although the artist is unknown,

01:53.482 --> 01:56.620
the authenticity and period
of the work have been confirmed

01:56.620 --> 02:00.241
by both the Soho Institute
of Fine Arts

02:00.241 --> 02:02.482
and the New York
Preservation Society

02:02.482 --> 02:05.482
and comes with
appropriate certification.

02:05.482 --> 02:09.931
Those who have seen it in our
offices have been entranced

02:09.931 --> 02:11.758
by both the trauma and power

02:11.758 --> 02:15.724
this marvelous
sculpture conveys.

02:15.724 --> 02:21.793
And with that, I'd like to start
the bidding at $50,000.

02:23.413 --> 02:24.620
$55,000.

02:24.620 --> 02:26.034
$60,000.

02:26.034 --> 02:27.137
$65,000.

02:27.137 --> 02:28.689
$70,000.

02:28.689 --> 02:30.413
Are you coming in, Sam?

02:30.413 --> 02:34.241
No? Maybe on the next lot.

02:34.241 --> 02:37.068
$75,000 to Bruce Ernst.

02:37.068 --> 02:39.448
Simon, are you coming in
at $80,000?

02:39.448 --> 02:42.862
I'm at $75,000 now,
and I'm looking for $80,000.

02:42.862 --> 02:45.344
Kate Horna, are you coming in?

02:45.344 --> 02:48.551
Thank you, Kate.
It's your bid at $80,000.

02:48.551 --> 02:52.034
I'm now looking for $85,000.

02:52.034 --> 02:53.689
It's against you, Bruce.

02:53.689 --> 02:56.068
Will you give me $85,000,
please?

02:56.068 --> 02:59.344
Marcel.
Thank you, Marcel.

02:59.344 --> 03:01.965
I'm now looking for $90,000.

03:01.965 --> 03:04.413
Bruce, I would like $90,000.

03:04.413 --> 03:06.275
Could you give me $90,000
please?

03:06.275 --> 03:08.413
Thank you, sir.

03:08.413 --> 03:11.551
Anyone else want to come in
against Bruce's bid?

03:11.551 --> 03:15.068
Alex, are you going
to give me $95,000?

03:15.068 --> 03:18.310
-Bid.
-Thank you, Miss Horna.

03:18.310 --> 03:22.827
$100,000 is now with Marcel.

03:22.827 --> 03:25.172
Bruce?

03:25.172 --> 03:27.206
-You sure?

03:33.275 --> 03:35.655
So you're out, Bruce?

03:35.655 --> 03:38.655
Okay. It's Marcel's bid.

03:40.482 --> 03:42.379
-$105,000.

03:44.586 --> 03:46.413
$120,000.

03:49.620 --> 03:52.793
No? Kate, it's your bid.

03:52.793 --> 03:54.793
-One, two, five.

03:54.793 --> 03:56.793
-$125,000.

03:56.793 --> 03:59.896
The bidding is now with Marcel
at $125,000.

03:59.896 --> 04:01.172
Can I get --

04:01.172 --> 04:03.103
-$130,000.

04:03.965 --> 04:05.655
-No?

04:05.655 --> 04:09.241
Fair warning to the room,
I'm selling to Kate Horna

04:09.241 --> 04:12.000
at $130,000.

04:13.034 --> 04:14.724
There it is.

04:16.551 --> 04:18.655
Thank you, Kate.

04:24.689 --> 04:26.758
-Mm-hmm.

04:26.758 --> 04:29.310
Yeah, of course. Wonderful.

04:29.310 --> 04:31.413
I will bring it back tomorrow.

04:31.413 --> 04:32.793
Okay.

05:12.724 --> 05:14.275
Oh.

05:49.931 --> 05:54.172
Great work, Kate.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.068
-I'm so sorry to bother you.

06:33.068 --> 06:34.379
-What are you doing here?

06:34.379 --> 06:36.275
-I know this is
highly unprofessional.

06:36.275 --> 06:39.000
-Unprofessional?
More like illegal.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.758
What? Did you follow me home?

06:40.758 --> 06:43.413
-Please hear me out, okay?
I'm -- I'm just in town

06:43.413 --> 06:45.896
for tonight's event,
and my clients insisted

06:45.896 --> 06:49.172
I make you another offer
for the Erinys bronze.

06:49.172 --> 06:51.172
If the answer is no,
that's okay.

06:51.172 --> 06:54.172
I will gladly fuck off
down the road,

06:54.172 --> 06:56.275
but they're willing
to pay double

06:56.275 --> 06:58.379
the purchase price
your clients did,

06:58.379 --> 07:03.413
plus throw in an additional
$25,000 bonus for you.

07:05.517 --> 07:08.034
-Why?

07:08.034 --> 07:12.586
-Because they see something
beautiful, and they want it.

07:18.068 --> 07:20.068
Your client will literally

07:20.068 --> 07:22.413
double their
investment overnight.

07:28.379 --> 07:31.827
-I'd also like 20%
of your commission.

07:31.827 --> 07:34.206
-Jesus. You play rough.

07:34.206 --> 07:35.551
-You're the one knocking
on my door.

07:35.551 --> 07:39.517
-Yeah, that --
That's fair. Okay.

07:39.517 --> 07:44.931
Deal. Why don't you give 'em
the call, and I'll wait outside?

07:44.931 --> 07:48.551
-Don't be an idiot.

07:53.344 --> 07:55.034
-Do you want a glass?

07:55.034 --> 07:56.482
-Oh, that's all right.

07:56.482 --> 07:59.344
I shouldn't be
celebrating this, uh, deal.

07:59.344 --> 08:04.068
-Champagne's already open.
Don't be a sore loser.

08:04.068 --> 08:06.862
-So, do you work for a gallery

08:06.862 --> 08:09.551
or a private collector?

08:09.551 --> 08:11.310
-A bit of both.

08:13.103 --> 08:15.689
You have very good taste in art.

08:15.689 --> 08:17.137
-Thank you.

08:17.137 --> 08:21.724
It's a baby collection,
but she's growing.

08:31.689 --> 08:35.000
-Wow.
-Good?

08:35.000 --> 08:36.482
-Very good.

08:38.724 --> 08:41.206
-I'll make the call.

10:47.068 --> 10:50.137
-Stop.

10:50.137 --> 10:52.103
Stop it.

10:52.103 --> 10:53.758
Stop it!

10:55.586 --> 10:57.344
Stop.

11:16.655 --> 11:18.793
-Yeah.

11:18.793 --> 11:22.724
Yeah, it was good
for a while, but...

11:22.724 --> 11:27.000
that's because he kept
that part of himself hidden.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.206
-Abusive men are
skilled at that.

11:31.344 --> 11:34.068
Has he tried
contacting you again?

11:34.068 --> 11:36.379
-No.

11:36.379 --> 11:38.482
No, I think he knows
it's over now.

11:38.482 --> 11:40.827
He'll...

11:40.827 --> 11:45.758
I mean, he knows how to call
the cops if he shows up again.

11:45.758 --> 11:48.275
He learned that lesson
last time.

11:49.620 --> 11:52.344
-And what have you learned,
Meredith?

12:00.620 --> 12:02.689
-I've learned...

12:05.931 --> 12:08.586
...not to absolve a man

12:08.586 --> 12:11.689
for his transgressions
against me.

12:14.517 --> 12:15.827
Bravo.

12:15.827 --> 12:18.344
-Yeah.

12:33.413 --> 12:36.344
-This was quite an undertaking.

12:38.482 --> 12:42.068
What are you so happy about?

12:42.068 --> 12:45.068
-My therapist gave me
a compliment.

12:45.068 --> 12:47.413
-Hey, that's awesome.
-Yeah.

12:47.413 --> 12:48.896
-How's it been going?
-Really good.

12:48.896 --> 12:51.206
Just it feels really nice
to finally feel good

12:51.206 --> 12:53.620
about myself again.
-Yeah.

12:53.620 --> 12:58.482
-His bullshit took up so much
space that I just had to learn

12:58.482 --> 13:00.724
how to not be
defined by it anymore.

13:00.724 --> 13:03.689
-Hey, I'm glad you
stuck with it.

13:03.689 --> 13:05.482
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

13:05.482 --> 13:07.931
We know what a struggle
this last year was for you.

13:07.931 --> 13:09.517
-Yeah.

13:09.517 --> 13:12.275
So, what are you doing
after work?

13:12.275 --> 13:14.034
How about we go out
and celebrate?

13:14.034 --> 13:15.620
-It's date night.
-Oh.

13:15.620 --> 13:17.551
-Linda's going to come crabbing
once this wraps up,

13:17.551 --> 13:19.793
and then we're off
to try growth.

13:19.793 --> 13:22.620
-Hate you and Linda for
being so hot and happy together.

13:22.620 --> 13:25.310
-You're supposed to choose one

13:25.310 --> 13:26.896
and complain about
the choice you make.

13:29.586 --> 13:31.758
-Well, Mer, that just leaves
you and me, so.

13:31.758 --> 13:34.517
-Okay, well, you know that
I love nothing more

13:34.517 --> 13:36.310
than getting drunk
and Googling murders with you.

13:36.310 --> 13:37.655
But I have plans this weekend.

13:37.655 --> 13:39.241
-What do you have planned
that's better than

13:39.241 --> 13:41.068
tequila and dead bodies?

13:41.068 --> 13:42.896
-I'm getting laid.

13:42.896 --> 13:45.517
Okay. Wait, wait, wait.

13:45.517 --> 13:46.620
-The mystery man.

13:46.620 --> 13:48.172
-Yeah, that's right.
-Mystery man?

13:48.172 --> 13:49.448
What mystery man?

13:49.448 --> 13:50.793
Why don't I know about
a mystery man?

13:50.793 --> 13:52.448
-'Cause we're just --
I don't know.

13:52.448 --> 13:54.275
-Wait. Why am I just learning
about this now?

13:54.275 --> 13:56.689
-Because that's not a big deal.

13:56.689 --> 13:59.793
-Getting laid is always
a big deal. I want details.

13:59.793 --> 14:02.896
-There aren't any details.
I met him at an exhibit opening.

14:02.896 --> 14:06.344
He's cute. He got me tacos.
We'll see what happens.

14:06.344 --> 14:07.793
-Mm.
-Yeah.

14:07.793 --> 14:10.068
-Okay. Alright.
I just want to know who he is

14:10.068 --> 14:11.413
and when we're going
to meet him.

14:11.413 --> 14:14.034
And how big his dick is.
-No, absolutely not.

14:14.034 --> 14:16.000
-I mean, this is -- inquiring
minds want to know.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.275
-You guys, I'm just getting
to know him myself.

14:18.275 --> 14:22.724
So you'll meet him as soon as I
decide that he's worth meeting.

14:22.724 --> 14:23.758
Okay?

14:23.758 --> 14:25.068
-Okay.

14:25.068 --> 14:28.137
-We're just happy for you.
-Yeah.

14:28.137 --> 14:29.413
-It's been a journey.

14:29.413 --> 14:32.310
-Oh, my God. I know.
I'm ready.

14:32.310 --> 14:34.724
-I know. Look at you.
-She's ready?

14:34.724 --> 14:39.517
-Yeah, well, you know,
if it works out,

14:39.517 --> 14:41.482
you can finally retire
that vibrator.

14:41.482 --> 14:44.241
-Oh, my God.
You have no idea.

14:44.241 --> 14:47.344
I had to take the batteries
out of the my TV remote.

14:47.344 --> 14:49.034
-I will buy you new batteries.

14:50.896 --> 14:53.206
-We're going to get fired.
We're going to get fired.

14:53.206 --> 14:55.827
-Ladies, I love you.

14:55.827 --> 14:57.689
Please don't ever forget that.

14:57.689 --> 15:00.862
-Aw.

15:51.275 --> 15:53.758
-What am I forgetting, Slice?

16:20.517 --> 16:21.793
-Bruce?

16:29.793 --> 16:31.000
-Hi.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.482
-Hi.
-Is that everything?

16:33.482 --> 16:36.068
-Yeah. Just the essentials.
-Wow.

16:36.068 --> 16:40.000
Stunning and pragmatic.
Might as well kill me now.

16:41.655 --> 16:43.413
Thank you.

16:59.172 --> 17:04.758
-Huh? The weirdest
job I've ever had.

17:04.758 --> 17:08.310
You know, I don't -- I don't
think I've ever had a weird job.

17:08.310 --> 17:10.965
My life was pretty dull
growing up.

17:10.965 --> 17:12.551
What about you?

17:12.551 --> 17:15.517
-When I was in college,
I worked for this ceramicist

17:15.517 --> 17:20.379
who had me hand paint the same
fish pattern on all her vases.

17:20.379 --> 17:22.413
So by the end of the summer,

17:22.413 --> 17:24.206
I'd done it like
a thousand times.

17:24.206 --> 17:25.448
-What kind of fish?

17:25.448 --> 17:29.068
-I'm not sure.
It looked like this.

17:31.034 --> 17:33.103
-Cute.
-Yeah.

17:33.103 --> 17:34.655
-What did you study in school?

17:34.655 --> 17:38.379
-My thesis was on deconstructing
the myth of the muse

17:38.379 --> 17:42.275
and the erasure
of female artists.

17:43.689 --> 17:45.482
-Oh.

17:48.241 --> 17:52.448
-What's the longest relationship
you've ever been in?

17:52.448 --> 17:54.275
-A year.

17:54.275 --> 17:57.931
What about you? What was our
longest relationship?

17:57.931 --> 18:01.241
-Three years.
But it felt like a lot longer.

18:01.241 --> 18:03.793
-Three years?
That sounds kind of serious.

18:03.793 --> 18:05.655
-Yeah.
-Did it end well?

18:05.655 --> 18:09.896
-No. Nope.
He wasn't very nice to me.

18:09.896 --> 18:11.758
-Oh.

18:11.758 --> 18:13.586
Sorry.

18:19.931 --> 18:23.000
But, um, what about your family?

18:23.000 --> 18:25.275
Are you close with your parents?

18:31.206 --> 18:33.689
-They died when I was a kid.

18:34.931 --> 18:38.137
-I'm so sorry. I had no idea.

18:42.724 --> 18:44.172
-How could you?

18:44.172 --> 18:46.655
We're just getting
to know each other.

18:50.413 --> 18:52.344
-Right.

19:20.896 --> 19:22.379
Oh, look at that.

19:22.379 --> 19:24.206
Do you want to stop
and get some snacks?

19:24.206 --> 19:26.551
I could actually really
use the bathroom.

19:28.827 --> 19:32.517
-Meredith, we're so close.
Um, you think you can hold it?

19:32.517 --> 19:35.551
I'd love to get to the cabin
and get settled in.

19:36.931 --> 19:40.241
-Uh, okay. Sure.

19:40.241 --> 19:42.448
-You're the best.

20:07.862 --> 20:10.793
I love this part.

20:10.793 --> 20:12.241
-What part?

20:12.241 --> 20:14.000
-The intimacy.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.379
It's my favorite part.

20:39.655 --> 20:40.724
Wow. This is --

20:40.724 --> 20:44.551
-I said it was remote.
Don't worry.

20:44.551 --> 20:47.034
-I'm not worried. It's just --
-What?

20:47.034 --> 20:48.586
-It's dark as hell.

20:48.586 --> 20:52.034
-Well, yeah.

20:52.034 --> 20:54.551
That's just the woods.

20:55.931 --> 20:58.172
-Yeah. No kidding.

21:04.344 --> 21:07.310
-Well, here we are.

21:16.655 --> 21:20.758
This place is really special
to me, Meredith.

21:20.758 --> 21:24.172
Um, it means a lot
that you agreed to come.

21:24.172 --> 21:26.000
-Oh.
-I'm really looking forward

21:26.000 --> 21:28.655
to our time here together.

21:28.655 --> 21:31.172
-It's gorgeous.

21:31.172 --> 21:33.862
-It is, isn't it?

21:33.862 --> 21:37.862
Um, why don't you
grab your stuff.

21:37.862 --> 21:39.068
I'll go open her up.

21:39.068 --> 21:41.172
-Uh, okay.

22:26.103 --> 22:29.068
-Leave.

22:29.068 --> 22:31.206
-What?

22:33.655 --> 22:34.896
-Huh?

22:34.896 --> 22:37.413
-That wasn't you?

22:37.413 --> 22:40.758
-I didn't say anything.

22:40.758 --> 22:42.517
-All right.

23:17.482 --> 23:19.310
-Got it.

23:19.310 --> 23:20.655
What are you doing?

23:20.655 --> 23:23.344
Come in. I'll give you
the master tour.

23:50.206 --> 23:52.482
Yeah, I know. It's, uh...

23:52.482 --> 23:55.068
-Oh.
-...rustic.

23:55.068 --> 23:57.931
-Uh...

23:57.931 --> 24:00.758
-No, this is, um...

24:00.758 --> 24:03.448
-It's okay?

24:03.448 --> 24:06.137
-Uh, yeah, it's absolutely
wonderful.

24:07.827 --> 24:09.206
-Yeah?

24:09.206 --> 24:12.068
-Yeah.
Like, I'm actually swooning.

24:12.068 --> 24:13.379
For a cabin.

24:13.379 --> 24:15.965
Yeah, it's just --
it's perfect.

24:15.965 --> 24:18.931
-Good.

24:21.586 --> 24:23.586
Oh, my God.

24:23.586 --> 24:26.068
What?!

24:27.206 --> 24:29.896
-Yeah.

24:29.896 --> 24:31.862
The Wrath of the Erinys.

24:31.862 --> 24:35.068
It's pretty gruesome, isn't it?

24:35.068 --> 24:36.448
I love the drama in it.

24:36.448 --> 24:42.068
I -- I think
they're absolutely terrifying.

24:42.931 --> 24:44.551
-Yeah. Yeah, I know.

24:44.551 --> 24:46.724
This came through
our museum recently

24:46.724 --> 24:49.172
to establish provenance.

24:49.172 --> 24:51.724
Hellenistic period.

24:51.724 --> 24:56.103
I can't believe you have this.
It's a really expensive piece.

24:56.103 --> 24:58.724
-It's a reproduction, actually.

24:58.724 --> 25:00.931
-No.

25:00.931 --> 25:03.482
-Yeah.

25:03.482 --> 25:05.310
Mm-hmm.

25:07.344 --> 25:12.068
-That is a hell
of a reproduction.

25:12.068 --> 25:14.172
-Yeah.

25:16.482 --> 25:20.689
Hey, come on. I'll give you
the rest of the tour.

25:20.689 --> 25:22.448
-All right.

25:27.103 --> 25:32.620
This is where I will be working
my magic this evening.

25:32.620 --> 25:34.448
-I...

25:36.172 --> 25:38.482
I mean...

25:41.310 --> 25:44.620
I'm already enchanted.

25:44.620 --> 25:46.965
-Well, good.

25:46.965 --> 25:49.344
Then I'm ahead of schedule then.

25:51.758 --> 25:54.724
This was going to be
my backup plan.

25:56.068 --> 25:58.034
-Ah.

25:59.275 --> 26:01.827
Okay. Red or white?

26:01.827 --> 26:05.413
-Right now, I'm thinking...

26:07.793 --> 26:08.862
...red.

26:08.862 --> 26:11.758
-Red it is.

26:11.758 --> 26:14.689
-Awesome.

26:14.689 --> 26:17.068
So, any other questions?

26:17.068 --> 26:19.206
-Yes. Where's your bathroom?

28:04.344 --> 28:07.896
-Wow. You look stunning.

28:07.896 --> 28:11.689
To art and beauty.

28:11.689 --> 28:13.965
-And the night ahead.

28:20.551 --> 28:22.482
Um, I brought that record
I was telling you about.

28:22.482 --> 28:24.931
-Oh, great.
Why don't you go put it on?

28:24.931 --> 28:26.379
I'll finish prepping this.

28:26.379 --> 28:28.034
-Yea-- Can I help.

28:28.034 --> 28:31.793
-And spoil the surprise? No.
You go make yourself at home.

30:32.655 --> 30:35.689
-Someone is not
a fan of the past.

31:25.137 --> 31:26.827
-Everything all right?

31:26.827 --> 31:29.482
-Yeah. Yeah. Sorry.

32:11.206 --> 32:14.275
I'm sorry.
I'm not crazy, I swear.

33:34.965 --> 33:37.172
Not yet.

34:10.482 --> 34:13.931
-I'm sorry. Are you okay?

34:13.931 --> 34:15.965
-Yeah. Yeah.

34:15.965 --> 34:19.896
Sorry. I'm just -- I just --
it's the woods or something.

34:19.896 --> 34:21.896
-Oh, you're scared. I...

34:21.896 --> 34:24.137
-No, I'm not. I'm --

34:24.137 --> 34:26.103
-Come inside.
Dinner's ready.

34:26.103 --> 34:28.655
-Okay.

34:49.206 --> 34:53.068
-There's this great quote
from Helen Gough.

34:53.068 --> 34:55.206
"People will forget
what you said.

34:55.206 --> 34:57.000
People will forget what you did.

34:57.000 --> 35:00.482
But people were never forget
how you made them feel."

35:00.482 --> 35:04.965
And I think that's why I was
drawn to Yotam Ottolenghi's

35:04.965 --> 35:06.724
approach to cooking,

35:06.724 --> 35:10.275
because you get a real sense
of history in each dish

35:10.275 --> 35:14.482
and, uh, your place in
that history, you know?

35:17.931 --> 35:19.482
Mer?

35:21.482 --> 35:23.620
-Hm? Sorry.

35:23.620 --> 35:25.551
-We don't have
to talk about my cooking,

35:25.551 --> 35:28.275
but it'd be nice to talk
at least.

35:28.275 --> 35:30.413
What were you thinking about?

35:30.413 --> 35:32.586
-Mmm...

35:34.758 --> 35:37.275
When did you get this place?

35:38.344 --> 35:42.482
-Oh. Came on the market
a few years ago. Why?

35:43.448 --> 35:48.517
-Have you ever experienced
anything weird here before?

35:50.241 --> 35:52.137
-Weird? What do you mean?

35:52.137 --> 35:57.206
-Like, um, I don't know.

35:57.206 --> 35:59.793
Unexplained stuff.

36:10.103 --> 36:12.862
Do you not want to be here?

36:12.862 --> 36:15.379
-Oh, no. Uh, what?

36:15.379 --> 36:20.034
-Then why are you making
such a stink about the cabin?

36:20.034 --> 36:23.931
-Oh, no, I'm not making a stink.
I'm just trying to --

36:23.931 --> 36:26.862
I'm just wondering
about your experiences here.

36:26.862 --> 36:31.206
-Well, I find
that my experiences here

36:31.206 --> 36:33.724
are usually
quite nice, Meredith.

36:33.724 --> 36:36.827
And if you just relax,
you might feel the same way.

36:36.827 --> 36:39.758
-Right. Okay.

36:39.758 --> 36:44.724
What about Lenora? Did she ever
experience anything?

36:44.724 --> 36:46.275
-Who?

36:46.275 --> 36:48.551
-Lenora, the woman
in your photo.

36:56.896 --> 36:58.172
She used to own the place.

36:58.172 --> 37:01.275
And no, she never
had any problems here.

37:01.275 --> 37:03.379
I'm getting some more wine.

37:06.068 --> 37:09.206
-I'm sorry, Bruce.

37:10.965 --> 37:12.655
Holy shit! Holy shit!
Holy shit!

37:12.655 --> 37:14.379
-What?
-There's someone on your patio.

37:14.379 --> 37:15.689
-What?
-There's someone

37:15.689 --> 37:18.931
on your fucking patio.

37:18.931 --> 37:21.241
-I think it's --
-What?

37:21.241 --> 37:23.172
-It's a woman.
-A woman?

37:23.172 --> 37:25.172
-Yes. Your motion sensor
light turned on,

37:25.172 --> 37:27.275
and I saw a woman out there.

37:28.724 --> 37:31.482
-I don't have
a motion sensor light.

37:31.482 --> 37:33.310
-Well...

37:39.034 --> 37:42.517
-Did you turn this on yourself?

37:42.517 --> 37:44.206
-See?

37:49.103 --> 37:51.482
-Are you fucking with me?

37:51.482 --> 37:54.758
-Bruce, I know what I saw.

38:36.482 --> 38:39.586
-Meredith, what the fuck?
-Sorry, sorry, sorry.

38:39.586 --> 38:42.689
I thought you couldn't
see anything with a light on.

38:47.689 --> 38:48.862
Do you see anything?

38:48.862 --> 38:50.000
-Just shut up.

38:50.000 --> 38:53.620
Just wait one second.

38:53.620 --> 38:56.103
Wait one second.

38:59.206 --> 39:02.172
It's nothing.

39:02.172 --> 39:04.586
-Are you sure?

39:04.586 --> 39:06.793
-Yeah.

39:08.379 --> 39:10.517
You're just imagining things.

39:15.137 --> 39:16.931
You're just imagining things.

39:16.931 --> 39:20.034
-Sorry. I just -- I know.

39:21.827 --> 39:23.206
-There.

39:23.206 --> 39:25.551
Now the light won't
freak you out anymore.

39:40.379 --> 39:43.931
-Maybe we should just go back
to the city.

39:43.931 --> 39:46.413
-What do you mean?

39:46.413 --> 39:48.206
-We can still spend
the weekend together.

39:48.206 --> 39:51.206
We just do it
at one of our apartments.

39:53.103 --> 39:55.551
-No, Meredith.

39:55.551 --> 39:57.000
We just got here.

39:57.000 --> 39:59.965
I just cooked you an entire meal
that you barely touched.

39:59.965 --> 40:03.241
And I really don't feel like
driving back to the city.

40:03.241 --> 40:06.965
Let's just relax,
have another glass of wine.

40:08.206 --> 40:10.241
-Okay. I can't.
-We're fine.

40:10.241 --> 40:11.551
-I can't.
-It's fine.

40:11.551 --> 40:13.413
-No, it's not.
-It was just a bat.

40:13.413 --> 40:15.413
A bat hit the window. Okay?

40:15.413 --> 40:17.448
It's an old cabin. Okay?

40:17.448 --> 40:20.068
We're in the woods.
We're completely alone out here.

40:20.068 --> 40:23.551
-Yeah, no, I know.
That's the problem.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.620
-What?

40:31.724 --> 40:35.655
You don't want to be here
alone with me?

40:35.655 --> 40:38.034
-No.

40:38.034 --> 40:40.379
I -- no, I mean, yes.

40:41.931 --> 40:44.103
-You're scared?

40:44.103 --> 40:47.310
-Yeah. I'm scared.

40:48.689 --> 40:51.275
Will you check what
that was, please?

40:52.689 --> 40:56.551
-Fine. But I think
you're being over-dramatic.

41:07.517 --> 41:10.344
-Okay, so, Bruce,

41:10.344 --> 41:13.379
I'm not comfortable
staying here tonight.

41:15.310 --> 41:16.620
Either you drive me home
right now,

41:16.620 --> 41:19.275
or I'm just going to call
the ride share.

41:22.586 --> 41:24.103
-Fine.

41:24.103 --> 41:26.310
-Good.

41:51.413 --> 41:54.034
-Hey.
-Get the hell out of there.

41:54.034 --> 41:55.482
-What?

42:45.931 --> 42:47.413
-Okay.

42:51.551 --> 42:54.793
Okay. It's time.

43:13.000 --> 43:15.758
-That statuette was stolen.

43:15.758 --> 43:17.103
-When?

43:17.103 --> 43:18.655
-A few months after
we certified it,

43:18.655 --> 43:20.724
the night
it went up for auction.

43:20.724 --> 43:24.586
The police
are still investigating.

43:24.586 --> 43:28.172
-Okay. I already told him that
we're leaving, so I'll just --

43:30.000 --> 43:32.724
-Mer? You ready?

43:35.586 --> 43:37.827
-I'm just using the toilet
before the long drive.

43:37.827 --> 43:39.724
I'll be right out.

43:41.448 --> 43:43.103
Did you hear me?
I'll be just a sec.

43:43.103 --> 43:45.068
-There's something else
you should know, Meredith.

43:45.068 --> 43:48.517
Something bad.

43:56.482 --> 43:58.137
The woman who bought
the sculpture

43:58.137 --> 44:00.586
is missing, too.

44:00.586 --> 44:02.724
Okay, um...

44:02.724 --> 44:03.827
um, um --

44:03.827 --> 44:07.068
I'm going to text you
from the car.

45:57.344 --> 45:59.413
-So should we hit the road?

46:11.379 --> 46:13.344
Ah!

48:46.931 --> 48:49.413
I lied in the car earlier.

48:53.103 --> 48:54.827
This is my favorite part.

49:41.862 --> 49:44.103
-Whatcha doing?

49:46.000 --> 49:47.758
Whatcha doing, Bruce?

49:52.517 --> 49:54.931
-Basking.

49:54.931 --> 49:56.448
-Basking?

49:56.448 --> 49:58.482
-Mm-hmm.

49:58.482 --> 50:01.379
Yeah.

50:01.379 --> 50:04.655
I'm basking in
the morning light.

50:07.862 --> 50:09.620
I'm a basker.

50:12.379 --> 50:14.655
-I think you're just
ignoring me.

50:21.137 --> 50:24.931
Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.

50:32.344 --> 50:36.586
-I had another dream last night.

50:36.586 --> 50:38.344
-Tell me.

50:39.758 --> 50:44.517
-There was this black and white
checkered floor all around me,

50:44.517 --> 50:48.793
and I knew if I stepped
on a black square,

50:48.793 --> 50:50.379
I'd fall through forever.

50:50.379 --> 50:56.931
So I was trying to keep my feet
on the white squares.

50:56.931 --> 51:00.206
But then I realized

51:00.206 --> 51:02.551
there were no white squares.

51:07.931 --> 51:09.655
-Weird.

51:21.551 --> 51:25.275
"Enter the Chorus of Furies,
questing like hounds."

51:28.931 --> 51:30.689
-What?

51:32.724 --> 51:34.517
-"Ho!

51:34.517 --> 51:38.379
Clear is here the trace of him
we seek.

51:38.379 --> 51:44.689
Follow the track of blood,
the silent sign."

51:44.689 --> 51:47.310
-What are you saying?

51:47.310 --> 51:49.655
-All your secrets are escaping.

52:21.103 --> 52:25.482
Ah. Ah!

52:31.620 --> 52:34.793
No.

52:34.793 --> 52:36.551
Oh, no.

52:44.413 --> 52:46.241
Oh.

52:50.517 --> 52:51.724
Okay.

52:55.034 --> 52:58.517
You got this.

52:58.517 --> 53:01.655
You got this.

53:01.655 --> 53:05.344
You got this.
You got this.

53:19.000 --> 53:21.068
Oh. Oh.

54:46.517 --> 54:48.068
Mer?

56:38.862 --> 56:41.068
Ah!

56:44.931 --> 56:46.655
-Bruce!

57:15.689 --> 57:17.448
-Mer?

57:25.931 --> 57:28.758
-What have you done?

57:28.758 --> 57:30.931
-Ah!

58:11.758 --> 58:13.517
-Fuck.

58:34.172 --> 58:36.551
What the fuck?!

1:02:43.137 --> 1:02:45.034
What are you doing?

1:03:48.862 --> 1:03:50.965
Ah!

1:04:03.551 --> 1:04:05.724
-Murderer! Thief!

1:04:05.724 --> 1:04:07.482
Murderer! Thief!

1:04:07.482 --> 1:04:09.448
-Fuck!

1:04:20.172 --> 1:04:21.379
I'm seeing things.

1:04:21.379 --> 1:04:22.241
Shut up.

1:04:22.241 --> 1:04:24.448
No. It's real.

1:04:24.448 --> 1:04:25.827
Shut up!

1:04:25.827 --> 1:04:32.620
Mount Superior has transformed
into flesh without flesh.

1:04:32.620 --> 1:04:36.896
To dwell among us.

1:05:31.724 --> 1:05:34.241
-Oh.

1:05:34.241 --> 1:05:39.000
Oh. You sneaky --

1:06:55.137 --> 1:07:00.413
-Why are you here? Hmm?
Vengeance?

1:07:02.379 --> 1:07:06.586
You want to wring remorse
from my body like a wet rag?

1:07:09.206 --> 1:07:14.275
Punish and torment me
with nightmares

1:07:14.275 --> 1:07:16.655
for the crimes I've committed?

1:07:20.482 --> 1:07:25.034
-Because you will get
nothing from me,

1:07:25.034 --> 1:07:27.000
demon.

1:07:29.103 --> 1:07:31.931
There are no nightmares
you can show me

1:07:31.931 --> 1:07:36.655
that will compare to the ones
I've been seeing my entire life.

1:07:57.310 --> 1:07:59.758
-I understand your anger.

1:08:02.068 --> 1:08:05.172
But I won't change a thing.

1:08:05.172 --> 1:08:07.275
-We'll see.

1:08:15.275 --> 1:08:16.689
-What the fuck?!

1:08:28.758 --> 1:08:30.448
-Oh, God!

1:09:19.137 --> 1:09:22.620
-Don't you fucking laugh at me!

1:09:22.620 --> 1:09:23.758
-Ah!

1:09:23.758 --> 1:09:24.793
-Ah!

1:10:27.137 --> 1:10:30.862
Is this what you want?

1:10:30.862 --> 1:10:33.482
Here. Here. Take it.

1:10:36.034 --> 1:10:38.655
Here. You can have it.
You can have it.

1:10:40.482 --> 1:10:44.655
Despite what you've seen,
I'm not a savage.

1:10:47.482 --> 1:10:49.413
I don't wanna hurt anyone.

1:10:51.310 --> 1:10:55.206
I want people to be happy.

1:10:55.206 --> 1:10:59.448
I want them to be happy with me.

1:10:59.448 --> 1:11:02.586
But...

1:11:02.586 --> 1:11:05.793
there's a piece

1:11:05.793 --> 1:11:08.448
floating inside of my head.

1:11:09.793 --> 1:11:13.482
It's not -- It's not who I am.
It's not even a part of me.

1:11:16.172 --> 1:11:19.275
But it takes control sometimes.

1:11:21.758 --> 1:11:28.000
When I see something, uh,
beautiful,

1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:32.448
this piece...wants it.

1:11:36.103 --> 1:11:39.241
Call me weak,

1:11:39.241 --> 1:11:41.620
call me damaged,

1:11:41.620 --> 1:11:44.000
call me broken.

1:11:44.000 --> 1:11:46.172
But you got to believe me.

1:11:48.344 --> 1:11:51.275
I try to fight the impulse.

1:11:53.758 --> 1:11:57.000
And I regret it
every time I lose.

1:11:59.241 --> 1:12:06.862
If returning this will make
things right,

1:12:06.862 --> 1:12:10.586
please take it.

1:12:10.586 --> 1:12:11.758
Here.

1:12:17.034 --> 1:12:18.793
Please take it.

1:12:20.241 --> 1:12:23.413
Please take it.

1:12:42.931 --> 1:12:44.689
Come on.

1:13:21.758 --> 1:13:25.103
Good.

1:13:25.103 --> 1:13:27.206
It's over.

1:13:31.931 --> 1:13:34.551
It's over.

1:13:34.551 --> 1:13:36.275
I won't let it happen again.

1:13:36.275 --> 1:13:38.034
I won't let it happen again.
I won't let it.

1:13:38.034 --> 1:13:40.379
I won't let it. I won't let it.
I won't let it. I won't let it.

1:13:40.379 --> 1:13:42.275
I won't let it happen again.
I won't let it happen again.

1:13:42.275 --> 1:13:43.931
Believe -- Believe what I say.

1:13:43.931 --> 1:13:46.000
Believe -- Believe what I say.
Believe in the words that I say.

1:13:46.000 --> 1:13:50.896
The things that I say.
Believe, truth in the night.

1:13:50.896 --> 1:13:53.379
The words are alive.
The night is alive.

1:13:53.379 --> 1:13:55.896
But the day doesn't know that
the words that are said

1:13:55.896 --> 1:13:57.655
can't be taken back.

1:14:00.965 --> 1:14:03.000
No!

1:15:21.448 --> 1:15:22.551
-What?

1:15:41.103 --> 1:15:45.241
-Bruce? Bruce.

1:15:47.724 --> 1:15:50.482
Can you hear me?

1:15:50.482 --> 1:15:52.413
Nod if you can hear me.

1:15:54.137 --> 1:15:57.517
Good. Can you speak?

1:15:59.206 --> 1:16:01.655
I asked, can you speak, Bruce?

1:16:03.620 --> 1:16:05.275
-Yes.

1:16:05.275 --> 1:16:06.689
-Very good.

1:16:06.689 --> 1:16:09.034
If you truly want
to make things right,

1:16:09.034 --> 1:16:11.344
we're going to have
a conversation.

1:16:11.344 --> 1:16:13.172
I'm going to ask you
some questions

1:16:13.172 --> 1:16:15.551
and you have
to answer truthfully.

1:16:18.827 --> 1:16:20.620
Why did you pick me?

1:16:23.206 --> 1:16:25.448
-Picked you?

1:16:25.448 --> 1:16:28.793
-Yes.
Why did you ask me out?

1:16:30.448 --> 1:16:33.034
-I didn't.

1:16:33.034 --> 1:16:36.724
-What does that mean?

1:16:36.724 --> 1:16:40.068
-I don't choose.

1:16:40.068 --> 1:16:42.034
He does.

1:16:42.034 --> 1:16:43.379
-The floating piece
inside you

1:16:43.379 --> 1:16:45.000
decides
who you're going to kill?

1:16:48.517 --> 1:16:52.344
Yeah. Exactly.

1:16:52.344 --> 1:16:55.068
-How many women have there been?

1:16:55.068 --> 1:16:59.448
-Oh, I don't know.

1:16:59.448 --> 1:17:01.379
A few.

1:17:01.379 --> 1:17:03.655
-Who's buried in the woods?

1:17:03.655 --> 1:17:07.862
Kate and Leonora.

1:17:07.862 --> 1:17:09.758
This is a new collection.

1:17:13.482 --> 1:17:15.034
-Did you know you were going
to kill me

1:17:15.034 --> 1:17:16.758
when you invited me here?

1:17:16.758 --> 1:17:19.413
-No.

1:17:19.413 --> 1:17:23.482
I was never planning
on killing you, Meredith.

1:17:23.482 --> 1:17:25.896
He was.

1:17:25.896 --> 1:17:27.172
I tried to stop him.

1:17:27.172 --> 1:17:30.758
I always do.
But he's too strong.

1:17:32.724 --> 1:17:34.448
It's nothing personal.

1:17:34.448 --> 1:17:37.620
-So there's nothing I could
have done differently?

1:17:37.620 --> 1:17:40.586
If it wasn't me,
it would have been someone else.

1:17:40.586 --> 1:17:42.068
-Yes.

1:17:42.068 --> 1:17:45.034
But you're very beautiful.

1:17:46.482 --> 1:17:50.482
-That always catches
his attention.

1:17:50.482 --> 1:17:53.344
-Which one of you kissed me?
-Sorry?

1:17:53.344 --> 1:17:56.551
-Which one of you kissed me?
Was it him or was it you?

1:17:59.517 --> 1:18:02.206
-Me.

1:18:02.206 --> 1:18:04.275
He can't be intimate.

1:18:04.275 --> 1:18:07.241
-So, you also find me
attractive.

1:18:10.068 --> 1:18:12.827
-Oh, yes.

1:18:12.827 --> 1:18:16.758
Meredith,
you're stunning.

1:18:16.758 --> 1:18:20.448
-And unlike him, you can act
on those feelings.

1:18:22.517 --> 1:18:24.275
-Somewhat.

1:18:26.793 --> 1:18:29.241
-Who saw me first?

1:18:32.241 --> 1:18:33.655
-I don't remember.

1:18:33.655 --> 1:18:35.724
-You don't remember
if you saw me first

1:18:35.724 --> 1:18:38.482
and he had to call you off
so he could kill me,

1:18:38.482 --> 1:18:40.310
of if he's the one
who pointed me out to you

1:18:40.310 --> 1:18:42.862
in the first place?

1:18:42.862 --> 1:18:47.793
-No. It doesn't work like that.

1:18:47.793 --> 1:18:49.517
You don't understand.

1:18:49.517 --> 1:18:50.896
-No.

1:18:50.896 --> 1:18:52.724
I can't imagine that I would.

1:19:12.448 --> 1:19:18.620
Help me understand, Bruce.
Dig deeper.

1:19:18.620 --> 1:19:22.034
Show me the piece
that's floating inside you.

1:19:22.034 --> 1:19:23.793
Dig it out.

1:19:26.310 --> 1:19:29.000
This will be cathartic.

1:19:29.000 --> 1:19:31.344
-Will it help purify me?

1:19:46.413 --> 1:19:48.689
-No, Bruce, you're fucked.

1:19:51.275 --> 1:19:53.413
This will be cathartic for me.

1:20:12.034 --> 1:20:14.275
-Fuck.

1:20:20.586 --> 1:20:22.620
No.

1:20:31.896 --> 1:20:33.551
You tricked me!

1:21:25.827 --> 1:21:30.172
Ooh.

1:21:35.310 --> 1:21:39.448
-Ho! Clear is here the trace of
him we seek.

1:21:39.448 --> 1:21:41.793
-Follow the tracks of blood,
the silent sign!

1:21:41.793 --> 1:21:43.379
-Ah!

1:21:43.379 --> 1:21:46.827
-Murderer! Thief!
Murderer! Thief!

1:21:46.827 --> 1:21:49.586
-Like to some hound that hunts a
wounded fawn...

1:21:49.586 --> 1:21:50.896
-Murderer! Thief!

1:21:50.896 --> 1:21:54.344
-We snuff along the scent of
dripping gore.

1:21:54.344 --> 1:21:56.517
-And inwardly we pant, for many
a day,

1:21:56.517 --> 1:21:59.206
toiling in chase that shall
fordo the man.

1:21:59.206 --> 1:22:00.758
-Murderer! Thief!

1:22:00.758 --> 1:22:02.241
-Murderer! Thief.

1:22:02.241 --> 1:22:04.206
-Murderer. Thief.

1:22:04.206 --> 1:22:07.172
-Murderer! Thief!
-No!

1:22:07.172 --> 1:22:09.241
-Murderer! Thief!

1:22:09.241 --> 1:22:11.655
Murderer! Thief!

1:22:11.655 --> 1:22:13.172
Murderer! Thief!

1:22:13.172 --> 1:22:15.068
-Murderer! Thief!
-Thief!

1:22:15.068 --> 1:22:20.310
-No!
-Thief!

1:22:21.931 --> 1:22:23.965
-That's right.
It's over.

1:22:23.965 --> 1:22:26.206
It's over. It's over.
It's over.

1:22:26.206 --> 1:22:28.413
-I won't let it.
I won't let it happen again.

1:22:28.413 --> 1:22:30.206
I won't...
-Believe what I say.

1:22:30.206 --> 1:22:33.862
Believe in what I say,
the words that I say.

1:22:33.862 --> 1:22:35.724
-What?!

1:22:35.724 --> 1:22:36.896
What do you want?!

1:22:36.896 --> 1:22:39.000
-The truth in the night.
The words are alive.

1:22:39.000 --> 1:22:40.482
The night is alive.

1:22:40.482 --> 1:22:42.413
-But the day doesn't know.

1:22:42.413 --> 1:22:45.482
-Follow, seek him, round and
round.

1:22:45.482 --> 1:22:49.172
-Scent, snuff, scan the ground,

1:22:49.172 --> 1:22:52.344
lest unharmed he slip away.

1:22:52.344 --> 1:22:59.275
The words that I've said
can't be taken back.

1:22:59.275 --> 1:23:00.793
-What do you want?!

1:23:27.137 --> 1:23:29.241
Of course.

1:23:32.310 --> 1:23:34.793
Oh, this is the perfect place.

1:23:36.896 --> 1:23:39.206
I'm ready.

1:23:39.206 --> 1:23:41.379
I'm ready!

1:23:44.551 --> 1:23:46.172
Where are you?!

1:23:47.827 --> 1:23:49.586
Where...

1:23:56.517 --> 1:23:59.206
Thank you.

1:23:59.206 --> 1:24:01.724
-You don't understand
gratitude, Bruce.

1:24:03.931 --> 1:24:05.586
You're a thief.

1:24:05.586 --> 1:24:10.620
You rob women of their power
and their beauty and their lives

1:24:10.620 --> 1:24:14.551
because you hate that
you have none of those things.

1:24:21.344 --> 1:24:25.965
-I knew you'd understand me.

1:24:25.965 --> 1:24:29.034
You flushed the red owl out.

1:24:29.034 --> 1:24:33.482
You saved us both.

1:24:33.482 --> 1:24:35.793
-It's over.

1:24:35.793 --> 1:24:39.862
-What? No.

1:24:39.862 --> 1:24:42.551
We're just beginning.

1:24:42.551 --> 1:24:47.275
The sun is coming out.
The darkness is gone.

1:24:47.275 --> 1:24:49.413
-I want you to say it.

1:24:53.275 --> 1:24:55.344
-What do you want me to say?

1:24:55.344 --> 1:24:58.827
-"I'm a murderer. I'm a thief."

1:24:58.827 --> 1:25:01.172
-What? No.

1:25:01.172 --> 1:25:03.862
-Admit it.
You're a murderer and a thief.

1:25:03.862 --> 1:25:06.275
-No!

1:25:06.275 --> 1:25:09.413
It was him!

1:25:09.413 --> 1:25:12.586
-Bruce, There's still a lot of
darkness inside you,

1:25:12.586 --> 1:25:14.965
and I can see it.

1:25:14.965 --> 1:25:16.724
It's right there.

1:25:30.724 --> 1:25:33.000
-It's not fair!
