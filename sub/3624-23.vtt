11:54.847 --> 11:56.614
Warmonga!

11:56.616 --> 11:59.250
So, what do you think, Wade?

11:59.252 --> 12:00.552
It sounds... Good.

12:00.554 --> 12:02.320
Except for the fact
that it's Drakken's plan?

12:02.322 --> 12:04.522
Well, he doesn't have
the best track record.

12:04.524 --> 12:06.925
That's one way to look at it.
What's Ron think?

12:06.927 --> 12:11.763
Well, now, what if Kim goes off
to some fancy-schmancy college

12:11.765 --> 12:14.399
while I'm stuck
at home jockeying

12:14.401 --> 12:16.301
for smarty mart
employee of the month?

12:16.303 --> 12:18.403
Warhawk will not be ignored!

12:18.405 --> 12:20.739
But, hey, out of sight,
out of mind.

12:20.741 --> 12:23.341
You know, she gets wrapped
up in her studies.

12:23.343 --> 12:25.577
I call, I text.
Does she answer?

12:25.579 --> 12:28.546
"Sorry. Busy."
It's killing me!

12:28.981 --> 12:31.483
Ow! Hey,
what... whoa!

12:44.029 --> 12:46.498
[Grunts]

12:46.500 --> 12:49.467
So, you and your little
plant potion

12:49.469 --> 12:51.336
are going to save the world?

12:51.338 --> 12:52.270
That's right!

12:52.272 --> 12:55.273
This time, for the first time,

12:55.275 --> 12:57.308
victory will be mine.

12:57.310 --> 12:59.711
[Crumbling]
Unh! [Grumbles]

13:00.646 --> 13:03.414
Ow!
Dr. D, move!

13:05.818 --> 13:09.587
My hypollinator mutagen!

13:09.589 --> 13:12.290
[Crying]

13:12.292 --> 13:15.927
Unh! No!

13:21.066 --> 13:23.601
Snag.

13:25.338 --> 13:29.674
I don't like Drakken being the
earth's last hope, either, but...

13:29.676 --> 13:32.043
no... I'm talking
about graduation

13:32.045 --> 13:34.078
and... and us and
what comes after.

13:34.080 --> 13:35.980
This whole thing
has shown me that

13:35.982 --> 13:38.583
I can't live without you.

13:39.084 --> 13:40.518
Ron, please, get a grip.

13:40.520 --> 13:42.554
Nothing is going
to come between us,

13:42.556 --> 13:44.689
except that.

13:48.828 --> 13:52.063
This reminds me of our first
Thorgoggle hunt on the moon of Parfa.

13:52.065 --> 13:54.365
You gave me the beast's
spine as a trophy.

13:54.367 --> 13:57.101
You can have this entire
planet as a trophy

13:57.103 --> 14:00.338
after these two
are annihilated.

14:07.112 --> 14:09.714
[Yelling]

14:10.850 --> 14:12.450
Kim, I've been hit!

14:12.452 --> 14:14.619
[Gasps]

14:17.089 --> 14:20.091
See? You see how
I can't live without you?

14:20.093 --> 14:24.696
At the very least, we're
talking major bone breakage.

14:24.698 --> 14:26.364
Ok, look.
Remember at graduation

14:26.366 --> 14:28.099
when I started to say
I had a confession?

14:28.101 --> 14:30.134
That was you?
I thought that was Reager.

14:30.136 --> 14:33.905
Anyway, you don't think
I'm scared, too?

14:33.907 --> 14:35.874
You? Scared?

14:37.076 --> 14:39.644
Of course she is.

14:44.750 --> 14:45.884
This ends now!

14:45.886 --> 14:47.452
Not yet!

14:47.454 --> 14:50.421
But very, very soon.
Dr. D!

14:50.423 --> 14:53.424
Prepare to taste defeat!

14:53.426 --> 14:55.860
And, boy, is it salty!

14:55.862 --> 14:58.997
Unh! [Grumbles]

15:03.135 --> 15:04.869
[Both laughing]

15:04.871 --> 15:07.605
These earthers
are inferior pests,

15:07.607 --> 15:09.073
but they are amusing.

15:09.075 --> 15:12.443
Attack!

15:20.019 --> 15:22.186
It is a cheerful attack.

15:22.188 --> 15:25.189
Oh, blue impostor,
what were you thinking?

15:25.191 --> 15:27.825
Take them down, boys!
Or is it girls?

15:27.827 --> 15:31.930
Oh, I never could get the whole
pistil and stamen thing.

15:31.932 --> 15:34.432
[Both laughing]

15:43.108 --> 15:47.845
Lorwardian technology
destroyed by... by flowers.

15:47.847 --> 15:50.748
This insult will not stand!

15:55.955 --> 15:57.922
Unh!

15:57.924 --> 15:59.457
Aah!

16:01.794 --> 16:04.162
[Groaning]

16:08.100 --> 16:10.601
For Lorwardia!

16:10.603 --> 16:12.737
Forget it.

16:15.207 --> 16:18.643
Aah! [Groaning]

16:28.187 --> 16:30.254
Ok, this was real,
but I've got to graduate

16:30.256 --> 16:32.123
before some other
disaster strikes.

16:32.125 --> 16:33.758
And stick us
with clean-up duty?

16:33.760 --> 16:38.196
Please and thank you.
Yeah, no. No way.

16:38.831 --> 16:41.099
[Groans] Just go.

16:41.101 --> 16:44.102
Did you think that the most
fierce warrior in the galaxy

16:44.104 --> 16:46.270
could be defeated
by flowers and children?

16:46.272 --> 16:49.107
I'm not a child.
Check your calendar.

16:49.109 --> 16:52.143
It's graduation day.

16:53.278 --> 16:54.746

Sensei?

17:03.690 --> 17:06.157
Come, warmonga. We will
take this one as a trophy.

17:06.159 --> 17:09.761
She will look handsome mounted
beside your Thorgoggle spine.

17:09.763 --> 17:11.562
You are the monkey master.

17:11.564 --> 17:12.630
I am?

17:12.632 --> 17:13.631
Mm.

17:13.633 --> 17:16.701
Sensei:
This is your destiny.

17:16.703 --> 17:18.169
You are ready.

17:18.171 --> 17:20.104
I am.

You blew off all your classes

19:45.318 --> 19:49.353
uh, yeah. Nothing important
happens in the last week.

19:49.355 --> 19:51.255
Except my pop quiz in homeroom,

19:51.257 --> 19:54.058
which you missed.
Thus, you did not pass,

19:54.060 --> 19:56.127

one credit short.

with you in that stuffy classroom.
