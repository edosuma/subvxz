is most impressive, wouldn't you agree?

06:32.976 --> 06:36.047

06:36.747 --> 06:39.650
Is it striving to get to the top?

Or does its spider brain have
no concept of there even being a top?

06:45.822 --> 06:51.715

going up and up and up forever.

- Why?

were called within 15 minutes.

- What the fuck are you doing?
- Detective Mims had a lead

18:06.063 --> 18:08.274
on a print discovered on the fake bomb.

18:08.374 --> 18:11.758
He followed up, found weapons
and drugs at the suspect's residence.

18:11.858 --> 18:15.195
So why didn't you wait for my okay
to go raid the apartment?

18:15.595 --> 18:19.866
- I'm Homicide. It was a homicide.
- Don't pull this bullshit on me.

18:19.966 --> 18:24.382
I allow Cincinnati PD to fully
partake in my investigations,

18:24.482 --> 18:27.340
but at the end of the day,
don't make the mistake.

18:27.440 --> 18:30.211
That money says federal reserve now.

18:30.311 --> 18:32.779
Well, you didn't do a very
good job of reserving it.

18:32.879 --> 18:35.315
- Wow, that's very clever.
- CAPTAIN: Mims, calm it.

18:35.415 --> 18:38.318
Captain O'Connell, shut the fuck up.

18:40.486 --> 18:42.622
Do you know how I'm able
to tell him that, Mims?

18:42.722 --> 18:45.995
Because my official title
is Special Agent in Charge

18:46.095 --> 18:49.011

over a Special Agent

- No.

19:08.281 --> 19:11.351
The print belongs to T.J. Jackson.

19:13.519 --> 19:17.323
- Say that again.
- What, you don't know who T.J. Jackson is?

19:17.423 --> 19:18.825
He was a ranger.

19:18.925 --> 19:22.336
Keyword there is was, T.J. Jackson's dead.

19:23.896 --> 19:26.165
James Jackson is T.J.'s little brother.

19:26.265 --> 19:30.903
We figured James had some of T.J.'s
old stuff, T.J. was a US ranger hotshot.

19:31.003 --> 19:34.008
So maybe he had some of this
high tech shit and they used it.

19:34.108 --> 19:37.677

- That's what you two figured?

19:37.777 --> 19:40.560

but not take the time to wipe it off?

move better than a SWAT team.

at the time of the robbery.

Hey, by the way...

20:19.150 --> 20:22.625
how much cash did you guys recover
from James Jackson's place?

20:22.855 --> 20:25.276
- No cash.
- Nothing?

None.

Okay, people,
things just got a lot more interesting.

20:43.075 --> 20:47.913
The print that our good buddy Mims found
is not that of petty thug James Jackson.

20:48.013 --> 20:50.997
It is the print of his big brother.

20:51.617 --> 20:54.821
His dead big brother T.J. Jackson.

21:02.294 --> 21:05.231
This young man, Alexander Hubert,

21:05.331 --> 21:09.756
was held for ransom in 2011
by a rogue group of US Army Rangers.

21:09.856 --> 21:14.607
One of those rogue soldiers was a
Cincinnati based native named T.J. Jackson.

21:14.707 --> 21:18.077
Kidnapping went South,
Alexander Hubert died.

21:18.177 --> 21:21.607

to the Hubert National family?

of Jeffrey Hubert.

Why did T.J. and his guys
kidnap Alexander Hubert?

21:39.449 --> 21:42.685
- Money.
- It didn't work, T.J. was killed.

21:42.785 --> 21:46.689

I'd ask you why you don't drink it,
but I don't give a fuck.

01:39:02.303 --> 01:39:04.539
What now, Agent Montgomery?

01:39:04.639 --> 01:39:07.782
Surely even your little mind
understands this country's so corrupt.

01:39:07.882 --> 01:39:11.658
What are you doing?
You can't touch me here.

01:39:12.380 --> 01:39:14.783
Or else I could have you killed.

01:39:14.883 --> 01:39:18.807
That, and it wouldn't cost me the price
of one of your cheap suits.

01:39:20.388 --> 01:39:22.524
You really don't like my suits?

01:39:22.624 --> 01:39:24.712
It's alright.

01:39:25.527 --> 01:39:27.181
Well...

01:39:40.708 --> 01:39:44.379
You're not drunk are you? One sip of this?

01:39:44.479 --> 01:39:46.548
[CHUCKLES]

01:39:47.108 --> 01:39:50.102
I'll go to hell so you can go to heaven.

01:40:05.567 --> 01:40:07.530
[SCREAMING]
