00:03.963 --> 00:06.590
Take your brother outside
as fast as you can. Go!

00:10.136 --> 00:14.014
Dad's on a hunting trip.
And he hasn't been home in a few days.

00:17.101 --> 00:18.269
DEAN:
This is Dad's book.

00:18.477 --> 00:20.896
I think he wants us to pick up
where he left off.

00:21.105 --> 00:23.441
Saving people, hunting things.
The family business.

00:23.649 --> 00:26.402
-Think Mom would've wanted this?
-I can't do this alone.

00:27.027 --> 00:28.154
I'm driving.

(CHATTERING)

01:00.060 --> 01:03.439
Man, these are some phat houses, huh?
I'd like to live here.

01:03.647 --> 01:06.400
Yeah. Too bad you can't afford it.

01:07.276 --> 01:08.819
Yeah, you're right.

01:09.028 --> 01:12.156
This neighborhood will be
damn expensive when it's done.

01:16.994 --> 01:18.287

DUSTIN:
Help me. I'm trapped!

01:50.528 --> 01:52.321
I broke my ankle!

01:53.280 --> 01:55.157
All right, I'll get a rope.

(DEAN CHUCKLES)

03:29.877 --> 03:32.254
You know, we could get day jobs
once in a while.

03:32.755 --> 03:35.633
Hunting's our day job.
And the pay is crap.

03:35.966 --> 03:37.635
Yeah, but hustling pool?

03:37.843 --> 03:41.013
Credit card scams? Not the most
honest thing in the world, Dean.

03:41.388 --> 03:43.182
Well, let's see. Honest...

03:43.390 --> 03:44.642
...fun and easy.

03:45.267 --> 03:49.021
It's no contest. Besides, we're good
at it. It's what we were raised to do.

03:49.229 --> 03:52.107
-Well, how we were raised was jacked.
-Yeah, says you.

03:52.316 --> 03:53.984
-We got a new gig or what?
-Maybe.

03:54.193 --> 03:56.904
Oasis Plains, Oklahoma.
Not far from here.

03:57.154 --> 03:59.239
A gas-company employee.

03:59.448 --> 04:03.077
Dustin Burwash supposedly died
from Creutzfeldt-Jakob.

04:03.285 --> 04:04.244
Huh?

04:04.453 --> 04:07.790
-Human mad cow disease.
-Mad cow.

04:07.998 --> 04:11.168
-Wasn't that on Oprah?
-You watch Oprah?

04:14.296 --> 04:18.133
So this guy eats a bad burger.
Why is it our kind of thing?

04:18.342 --> 04:21.053
Mad cow disease causes
massive brain degeneration.

04:21.261 --> 04:23.806
It takes months, even years,
for the damage to appear.

04:24.014 --> 04:27.685
But this guy Dustin, sounds like his
brain disintegrated in about an hour.

04:27.893 --> 04:29.812
-Maybe less.
-Okay. That's weird.

04:30.020 --> 04:32.439
Yeah. Now, it could be a disease.

04:32.523 --> 04:35.192
Or it could be something much nastier.

04:35.275 --> 04:37.319
All right. Oklahoma.

04:37.569 --> 04:39.613
Man. Work, work, work.

04:39.822 --> 04:42.491
No time to spend my money.

04:56.296 --> 04:58.382
Travis Weaver?

04:59.216 --> 05:00.634
Yeah, that's right.

05:01.260 --> 05:04.179
Are you the Travis
who worked with Uncle Dusty?

05:04.388 --> 05:05.889
Dustin never mentioned nephews.

05:06.432 --> 05:08.475
Really? Well, he sure mentioned you.

05:08.684 --> 05:10.436
-He said you were the greatest.
-Yeah.

05:10.644 --> 05:12.312
Oh, he did?

05:13.355 --> 05:17.151
Listen, we wanted to ask you,
what exactly happened out there?

05:18.277 --> 05:19.486
I'm not sure.

05:19.695 --> 05:22.990
He fell in a sinkhole. I went
to the truck to get some rope...

05:23.240 --> 05:24.950
...and by the time I got back....

05:25.492 --> 05:26.368
What did you see?

05:27.661 --> 05:31.665
-Nothing. Just Dustin.
-No wounds or anything?

05:31.874 --> 05:36.712
Well, he was bleeding from his eyes
and his ears, his nose. That's it.

05:37.504 --> 05:40.424
So you think it could be
this whole mad cow thing?

05:40.799 --> 05:43.343
I don't know.
That's what the doctors are saying.

05:43.552 --> 05:47.181
But if it was, he would've
acted strange beforehand...

05:47.389 --> 05:49.516
...like dementia, loss of motor control.

05:49.600 --> 05:51.727
-You ever notice anything like that?
-No.

05:51.810 --> 05:53.228
No way.

05:53.437 --> 05:56.315
But then if it wasn't some disease,
what the hell was it?

05:57.357 --> 06:00.611
-That's a good question.
-Can you tell us where this happened?

06:00.819 --> 06:02.112
Yeah.

06:25.302 --> 06:26.345
DEAN:
Huh.

06:27.012 --> 06:28.555
What do you think?

06:28.639 --> 06:32.184
I don't know. But if Travis was right,
it happened pretty damn fast.

06:33.185 --> 06:35.604
DEAN: So, what, some sort of creature
chewed on his brain?

06:35.979 --> 06:37.397
No, there'd be an entry wound.

06:37.606 --> 06:40.442
Sounds like this thing
worked from the inside.

06:44.780 --> 06:47.407
Looks like there's only room for one.

06:47.616 --> 06:49.201
You wanna flip a coin?

06:49.993 --> 06:52.621
Dean, we have no idea
what's down there.

06:53.372 --> 06:55.249
All right. I'll go if you're scared.

06:55.457 --> 06:57.376
-Scared?
-Flip the damn coin.

06:57.584 --> 06:58.794
(DEAN CHUCKLES)

07:00.963 --> 07:03.799
All right, call it in the air, chicken.

07:04.842 --> 07:07.386
-I'm going.
-I said I'd go.

07:07.594 --> 07:08.971
SAM: I'm going.
-All right.

07:11.181 --> 07:12.808
Don't drop me.

07:17.396 --> 07:20.065
DEAN: So you found some
beetles. In a hole in the ground.

07:20.983 --> 07:22.609
That's shocking, Sam.

07:22.818 --> 07:25.195
There were no tunnels, no tracks...

07:25.404 --> 07:28.031
...no evidence of any other kind
of creature down there.

07:28.240 --> 07:31.660
You know, some beetles do eat meat.
It's usually dead meat, but--

07:31.743 --> 07:33.704
-How many did you find down there?
-Ten.

07:34.872 --> 07:37.332
It'd take more than that
to eat out some dude's brain.

07:37.541 --> 07:38.834
Well, maybe there were more.

07:39.251 --> 07:41.253
I don't know.
Sounds like a stretch to me.

07:41.461 --> 07:44.131
We need more information
on the area, the neighborhood...

07:44.381 --> 07:47.259
...whether something like this
has ever happened before.

07:48.802 --> 07:51.638
-What?
DEAN: I know a good place to start.

07:52.681 --> 07:55.392
I'm kind of hungry for a little barbecue,
how about you?

07:57.519 --> 07:59.104
We can't talk to the locals?

07:59.313 --> 08:01.315
The free food's
got nothing to do with it?

08:01.523 --> 08:04.526
-Of course not. I'm a professional.
-Right.

08:23.587 --> 08:26.548
Growing up in a place like this
would freak me out.

08:26.632 --> 08:28.634
Why?

08:28.717 --> 08:31.845
The manicured lawns,
"How was your day, honey?"

08:32.054 --> 08:33.931
I'd blow my brains out.

08:34.806 --> 08:37.351
There's nothing wrong with normal.

08:37.893 --> 08:40.562
I'd take our family
over normal any day.

08:41.563 --> 08:42.689
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

08:44.066 --> 08:45.943

-Is this the barbecue?

08:46.151 --> 08:50.322
Yeah. Not the best weather, but....
I'm Larry Pike, the developer here.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.366
-And you are...?
-Dean. This is Sam.

08:52.574 --> 08:54.576
-Sam.
-Sam, Dean. Good to meet you.

08:54.660 --> 08:57.287
-So you're interested in Oasis Plains?
-Yes, sir.

08:57.579 --> 09:01.875
Let me just say, we accept homeowners
of any race, religion, color...

09:02.834 --> 09:04.753
...or sexual orientation.

09:05.712 --> 09:07.589
We're brothers.

09:07.839 --> 09:11.009
Our father's getting on in years.
We're looking for a place for him.

09:11.468 --> 09:15.180
Great. Great. Well, seniors
are welcome too. Come on in.

09:17.516 --> 09:18.725
This is fabulous.

09:18.934 --> 09:20.727
SAM:
You said you were the developer?

09:20.811 --> 09:24.106
LARRY: Eighteen months ago, I was
walking this valley with my survey team.

09:24.189 --> 09:26.692
There was nothing here
but scrub brush and squirrels.

09:26.900 --> 09:29.611
You know what, we built
such a nice place to live...

09:29.695 --> 09:32.781
...that I actually bought into it
myself. This is our house.

09:32.864 --> 09:36.785
We're the first family in Oasis Plains.
This is my wife, Joanie.

09:36.868 --> 09:38.036
-Hi there.
DEAN: Hi.

09:38.120 --> 09:39.579
Sam and Dean.

09:39.788 --> 09:40.580
-Sam.
-Pleasure.

09:40.789 --> 09:44.251
Tell them how much you love the place,
honey. And lie if you have to...

09:44.501 --> 09:46.795
-...because I need to sell some houses.
-Right.

09:46.878 --> 09:48.839
Boys, if you'll excuse me.

09:48.922 --> 09:52.926
Don't let his salesman routine scare you.
This really is a great place to live.

09:53.135 --> 09:56.471
-Hi, I'm Lynda Bloome, head of sales.
-Lynda was second to move in.

09:56.680 --> 09:58.140
She's a very noisy neighbor, though.

(LYNDA LAUGHING)

09:59.891 --> 10:01.435
She's kidding, of course.

10:01.518 --> 10:04.771
I take it you two are interested
in becoming homeowners?

10:04.980 --> 10:06.481
-Well....
-Yeah, well--

10:06.690 --> 10:08.650
Let me just say
that we accept homeowners...

10:08.900 --> 10:11.653
...of any race, religion, color...

10:12.362 --> 10:14.614
...or sexual orientation.

10:14.781 --> 10:16.491
Right.

10:16.700 --> 10:19.953
I'm gonna go talk to Larry.
Okay, honey?

10:24.750 --> 10:26.293
You got three choices:

10:26.543 --> 10:28.211
Carpet, hardwood and tile.

10:28.420 --> 10:29.755
Oh.

10:30.047 --> 10:34.760
-Someone likes bugs.
-My son. He's into insects.

10:35.260 --> 10:37.554
He's very inquisitive.

10:37.804 --> 10:38.847
Hmm.

10:38.930 --> 10:41.975
Who can say no to a steam shower?
I use mine every day.

10:42.601 --> 10:43.769
Sounds great.

10:43.977 --> 10:46.772
You also have three different
whirlpool tubs to choose from.

10:46.980 --> 10:49.858
The hardware for the tubs
includes nickel or brass.

10:49.941 --> 10:52.110
-In the kitchen you can choose--
-Excuse me.

10:52.444 --> 10:53.695
LYNDA:
Okay.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.084
Is this yours?

11:07.292 --> 11:10.879
-You gonna tell my dad?
-I don't know. Who's your dad?

11:10.962 --> 11:14.091
Yeah. Larry usually skips me
in the family introductions.

11:14.257 --> 11:17.719
Ouch. The first-name basis
with the old man sounds pretty grim.

11:17.803 --> 11:19.846
Well, I'm not exactly
brochure material.

11:20.055 --> 11:22.724
Well, hang in there.
It gets better, I promise.

11:23.016 --> 11:24.476
-When?
LARRY: Matthew.

11:33.360 --> 11:36.530
I am so sorry about
my son and his pet.

11:36.738 --> 11:39.783
-It's no bother.
-Excuse us.

(INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE)

11:52.087 --> 11:53.964
Dad?

11:54.172 --> 11:57.759
-Dad never treated us like that.
-Well, Dad never treated you like that.

11:57.843 --> 12:00.762
You were perfect.
He was all over my case.

12:01.763 --> 12:03.515
You don't remember?

12:03.723 --> 12:06.893
Maybe he had to raise his voice,
but sometimes you were out of line.

12:07.102 --> 12:10.897
Right. Like when I said I'd rather
play soccer than learn bowhunting.

12:10.981 --> 12:13.483
Bowhunting's an important skill.

12:13.567 --> 12:15.110
Whatever.

12:15.735 --> 12:19.698
-How was your tour?
-Oh, it was excellent. I'm ready to buy.

12:19.906 --> 12:21.950
So you might be on to something.

12:22.033 --> 12:25.036
Looks like Dustin Burwash
wasn't the first strange death here.

12:25.120 --> 12:27.956
-What happened?
-A year ago, before they broke ground...

12:28.039 --> 12:30.667
...one of Larry's surveyors
dropped dead on the job.

12:30.750 --> 12:33.128
Get this: a severe allergic reaction
to bee stings.

12:33.336 --> 12:34.796
-More bugs.
-More bugs.

12:36.965 --> 12:39.551
I've heard of killer bees,
but killer beetles?

12:39.759 --> 12:42.387
What is it that could make
different bugs attack?

12:43.054 --> 12:46.141
Well, hauntings sometimes
include bug manifestations.

12:46.349 --> 12:48.935
But I didn't see any evidence
of ghost activity.

12:49.019 --> 12:50.896
Yeah, me neither.

12:51.855 --> 12:53.773
Maybe they're being controlled
somehow.

12:53.982 --> 12:55.650
You know, by something or someone.

12:55.859 --> 12:58.820
-You mean like Willard?
-Yeah. Bugs instead of rats.

12:59.946 --> 13:03.992
There are cases of psychic connections
between people and animals.

13:04.075 --> 13:08.079
-Elementals, telepaths.
-Yeah, the whole Timmy-Lassie thing.

13:08.788 --> 13:11.833
Larry's kid. Bugs for pets.

13:12.334 --> 13:13.585
-Matt?
-Yeah.

13:14.920 --> 13:17.172
He tried to scare the realtor
with a tarantula.

13:17.380 --> 13:19.883
-Think he's our Willard?
-I don't know.

13:19.966 --> 13:22.302
Anything's possible, I guess.

13:23.803 --> 13:26.014
Hey, pull over here.

13:34.439 --> 13:36.483
What are we doing here?

13:39.653 --> 13:42.614
It's too late to talk to anybody else.

13:43.031 --> 13:45.283
We're gonna squat in an empty house?

13:46.159 --> 13:48.828
I wanna try the steam shower.
Come on.

13:49.162 --> 13:50.789
Come on!

14:17.816 --> 14:20.819
WOMAN (ON TV): Atoka Valley County
began mandatory insecticide...

14:21.027 --> 14:23.738
...spraying across a wide swath
of the district today.

14:23.947 --> 14:26.241
Authorities say the decision
to spray was made...

14:26.449 --> 14:29.411
...because of several recent cases
of West Nile virus...

14:29.619 --> 14:33.999
...coupled with a dramatic increase in
the mosquito population in some areas.

14:34.207 --> 14:39.212
Although some residents cite concerns
about the high levels of pesticide--

15:04.279 --> 15:05.572
(SCREAMING)

15:39.773 --> 15:42.192
-You ever coming out of there?
DEAN: What?

15:42.400 --> 15:45.195
-A police call came in on the scanner.
DEAN: Hold on.

15:45.403 --> 15:49.324
Someone was found dead
three blocks from here. Come on.

15:50.742 --> 15:54.329
-This shower is awesome.
-Come on!

16:21.231 --> 16:23.650
LARRY: Look, I don't know
anything more right now.

16:24.192 --> 16:26.820
I'll have to call you back.
All right.

16:27.529 --> 16:29.197
Hello. You're back early.

16:29.406 --> 16:32.075
We just drove in to take another look
at the neighborhood.

16:32.283 --> 16:33.576
What's going on?

16:35.286 --> 16:38.456
You guys met Lynda Bloome
at the barbecue?

16:38.665 --> 16:39.791
The realtor.

16:40.417 --> 16:43.294
Well, she passed away last night.

16:44.838 --> 16:46.673
What happened?

16:46.923 --> 16:51.261
I'm still trying to find out.
I identified the body for the police.

16:51.469 --> 16:53.680
Look, I'm sorry.
This isn't a good time.

16:54.055 --> 16:56.474
-It's okay.
-Excuse me.

16:59.227 --> 17:01.354
You know what we have to do, right?

17:01.563 --> 17:04.607
-Yeah. Get in that house.
-See if we got a bug problem.

17:05.024 --> 17:06.317
(SIREN WAILING)

17:31.968 --> 17:34.637
DEAN:
This looks like the place.

17:46.983 --> 17:48.526
Spiders.

17:48.610 --> 17:51.529
-From Spider-Boy?
-Matt.

17:52.530 --> 17:54.491
Maybe.

18:16.429 --> 18:19.265
-Isn't his house that way?
-Yep.

18:22.852 --> 18:24.395
So where's he going?

18:49.546 --> 18:50.880
SAM:
Hey, Matt.

18:51.714 --> 18:53.508
Remember me?

18:53.716 --> 18:56.970
-What are you doing out here?
-Well, we wanna talk to you.

18:57.595 --> 18:59.806
You're not here to buy a house,
are you?

19:00.557 --> 19:03.476
Wait. You're not serial killers?

19:03.685 --> 19:05.812
No, no. No, I think you're safe.

19:06.980 --> 19:08.731
DEAN:
So, Matt...

19:09.315 --> 19:11.693
...you sure know a lot about insects.

19:12.193 --> 19:13.611
So?

19:13.820 --> 19:16.823
Did you hear what happened
to Lynda, the realtor?

19:17.782 --> 19:21.703
-I hear she died this morning.
-That's right. Spider bites.

19:23.162 --> 19:26.708
Matt, you tried to scare her
with a spider.

19:28.543 --> 19:31.754
Wait. You think I had something
to do with that?

19:31.963 --> 19:33.590
You tell us.

19:33.798 --> 19:36.134
That tarantula was a joke.

19:36.342 --> 19:39.512
Anyway, that wouldn't explain
the bee attack or the gas-company guy.

19:41.180 --> 19:44.350
-You know about those?
-There is something going on here.

19:44.601 --> 19:48.521
I don't know what, but something's
happening with the insects.

19:49.147 --> 19:51.357
Let me show you something.

19:58.448 --> 20:01.576
SAM: So if you knew about all this
bug stuff, why not tell your dad?

20:01.659 --> 20:05.413
-Maybe he could clear everybody out.
MATT: Believe me, I've tried...

20:05.496 --> 20:07.290
...but Larry doesn't listen to me.

20:07.498 --> 20:09.459
SAM: Why not?
MATT: Mostly?

20:09.667 --> 20:11.669
He's too disappointed in his freak son.

20:13.171 --> 20:15.506
-I hear you.
-You do?

20:17.884 --> 20:20.762
-Matt, how old are you?
-Sixteen.

20:21.304 --> 20:24.557
Don't sweat it, because in two years,
something great's gonna happen.

20:24.766 --> 20:26.434
-What?
-College.

20:26.643 --> 20:29.604
You'll be able to get out of that house
and away from your dad.

20:29.812 --> 20:33.232
What kind of advice is that?
Kid should stick with his family.

20:37.320 --> 20:40.156
-How much further, Matt?
-We're close.

21:01.052 --> 21:03.346
I've been keeping track
of insect populations.

21:03.554 --> 21:06.015
It's part of an AP science class.

21:06.224 --> 21:08.559
You two are like peas in a pod.

21:09.644 --> 21:11.854
-What's been happening?
-A lot.

21:12.438 --> 21:16.567
I mean, from bees to earthworms,
beetles...

21:16.651 --> 21:19.737
...you name it. It's like
they're congregating here.

21:20.071 --> 21:22.365
-Why?
-I don't know.

21:24.742 --> 21:26.577
What's that?

22:02.363 --> 22:04.323
There's something down there.

22:10.329 --> 22:12.123
Come on. Come on.

23:04.801 --> 23:07.595
So a bunch of skeletons
in an unmarked grave.

23:07.804 --> 23:11.140
Well, maybe this is a haunting.
Pissed-off spirits...

23:11.349 --> 23:13.643
-...some unfinished business?
-Yeah, maybe.

23:13.851 --> 23:17.146
The question is, why bugs?
And why now?

23:17.355 --> 23:19.357
That's two questions.

23:19.982 --> 23:21.859
Hey, so with that kid back there...

23:22.068 --> 23:25.071
...how could you tell him
to just ditch his family like that?

23:25.154 --> 23:28.116
Just, I know what
the kid's going through.

23:28.199 --> 23:30.409
How about telling him
to respect his old man?

23:30.618 --> 23:32.411
-How's that for advice?
-Dean, come on.

23:32.620 --> 23:35.498
This isn't about his old man.
You think I didn't respect Dad.

23:35.832 --> 23:37.917
That's what this is about.

23:38.126 --> 23:41.295
-Let's forget it. Sorry I brought it up.
-I respected him.

23:41.504 --> 23:44.173
But no matter what I did,
it was never good enough.

23:44.423 --> 23:48.177
-So, what, Dad was disappointed in you?
-"Was"?

23:48.386 --> 23:51.806
-Is. Always has been.
-Why would you think that?

23:52.014 --> 23:54.517
Because I didn't wanna bowhunt.
Or hustle pool.

23:54.767 --> 23:56.978
Because I wanted to go to school
and live my life.

23:57.186 --> 24:00.148
Which, in our whacked-out family,
made me the freak.

24:01.149 --> 24:04.861
Yeah, you were kind of like
the blond chick in The Munsters.

24:05.069 --> 24:09.824
Dean, you know what most dads are
when their kids score a full ride?

24:10.032 --> 24:11.951
Proud.

24:12.160 --> 24:14.996
Most dads don't toss their kids
out of the house.

24:15.496 --> 24:17.707
I remember that fight.

24:17.915 --> 24:21.419
In fact, I seem to recall a few choice
phrases coming out of your mouth.

24:25.506 --> 24:30.011
You know, truth is,
when we finally do find Dad...

24:30.219 --> 24:32.680
...I don't know if he's even gonna
wanna see me.

24:34.056 --> 24:37.101
Sam, Dad was never disappointed
in you.

24:37.310 --> 24:39.061
Never.

24:39.270 --> 24:42.273
-He was scared.
-What are you talking about?

24:42.481 --> 24:46.194
He was afraid of what could've
happened to you if he wasn't around.

24:46.819 --> 24:49.155
But even when you two
weren't talking...

24:49.363 --> 24:52.200
...he used to swing by Stanford
whenever he could.

24:52.283 --> 24:55.036
Keep an eye on you.
Make sure you were safe.

24:56.078 --> 24:57.163
What?

24:58.289 --> 24:59.874
Yeah.

25:03.169 --> 25:06.172
Why didn't he tell me any of that?

25:06.589 --> 25:10.176
Well, it's a two-way street, dude.
You could have picked up the phone.

25:15.223 --> 25:17.516
Come on. We're gonna be late
for our appointment.

25:25.274 --> 25:29.153
REARDON: So you two are students?
-Yeah. Yeah.

25:29.237 --> 25:33.783
-We're in your class. Anthro 101?
REARDON: Oh, yeah.

25:33.866 --> 25:36.786
So, what about the bones, professor?

25:37.328 --> 25:40.122
This is quite an interesting find
you've made.

25:40.206 --> 25:44.835
I'd say they're 170 years old,
give or take.

25:44.919 --> 25:48.798
The time frame and the geography
heavily suggest Native American.

25:49.006 --> 25:52.176
Were there any tribes or reservations
on that land?

25:52.385 --> 25:55.012
Not according to the historical record.

25:55.179 --> 25:56.847
But...

25:57.056 --> 26:02.144
...the relocation of native peoples
was quite common at that time.

26:02.228 --> 26:03.729
SAM:
Right.

26:03.813 --> 26:06.440
Well, are there any local legends?

26:06.649 --> 26:09.277
Oral histories about the area?

26:09.986 --> 26:11.570
Well...

26:11.779 --> 26:15.074
...you know,
there's a Euchee tribe in Sapulpa.

26:15.533 --> 26:17.743
It's about 60 miles from here.

26:18.953 --> 26:21.289
Someone out there
might know the truth.

26:23.958 --> 26:25.126
All right.

26:33.217 --> 26:34.969
(INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE)

27:11.255 --> 27:13.215
Joe White Tree?

27:14.258 --> 27:17.511
We'd like to ask you a few questions,
if that's all right.

27:17.720 --> 27:21.474
-We're students from the university.
-No, you're not. You're lying.

27:23.351 --> 27:24.435
Um....

27:24.643 --> 27:25.686
Well, truth is--

27:25.895 --> 27:30.107
You know who starts sentence
with "truth is"? Liars.

27:35.071 --> 27:36.697
Have you heard of Oasis Plains?

27:36.906 --> 27:39.992
It's a housing development
near the Atoka Valley.

27:42.036 --> 27:43.496
I like him.

27:43.704 --> 27:46.082
He's not a liar.

27:46.290 --> 27:48.292
I know the area.

27:48.501 --> 27:50.753
What can you tell us
about the history there?

27:51.003 --> 27:53.714
-Why do you wanna know?
SAM: Something....

27:54.382 --> 27:58.886
Something bad is happening
in Oasis Plains.

27:59.095 --> 28:04.058
We think it might have something to do
with some old bones we found there.

28:04.266 --> 28:06.185
Native American bones.

28:10.398 --> 28:13.275
I'll tell you
what my grandfather told me.

28:13.359 --> 28:15.820
What his grandfather told him.

28:15.903 --> 28:20.324
Two hundred years ago, a band
of my ancestors lived in that valley.

28:21.200 --> 28:24.870
One day the American cavalry
came to relocate them.

28:28.124 --> 28:30.126
They were resistant...

28:30.334 --> 28:32.503
...the cavalry impatient.

28:33.295 --> 28:36.090
As my grandfather put it:

28:36.298 --> 28:43.139
"On the night the moon and the sun
share the sky as equals...

28:43.347 --> 28:46.392
...the cavalry first raided our village."

28:46.475 --> 28:49.520
They murdered, raped.

28:50.354 --> 28:52.731
The next day, the cavalry came again.

28:52.940 --> 28:55.234
And the next and the next.

28:55.443 --> 28:58.696
And on the sixth night,
the cavalry came one last time.

28:59.488 --> 29:01.532
And by the time the sun rose...

29:01.740 --> 29:07.830
...every man, woman and child
still in the village was dead.

29:11.917 --> 29:13.919
They say on the sixth night...

29:14.128 --> 29:16.422
...as the chief of the village
lay dying...

29:16.630 --> 29:19.341
...he whispered to the heavens...

29:19.425 --> 29:23.554
...that no white man would ever
tarnish this land again.

29:23.637 --> 29:28.309
Nature would rise up
and protect the valley.

29:28.517 --> 29:32.021
And it would bring as many days
of misery and death...

29:32.229 --> 29:36.317
...to the white man as the cavalry
had brought upon his people.

29:38.110 --> 29:39.778
Insects.

29:39.987 --> 29:42.156
Sounds like nature to me.

29:43.199 --> 29:47.161
-Six days.
-And on the night of the sixth day...

29:47.369 --> 29:49.622
...none would survive.

29:57.379 --> 30:00.090
-When did the gas-company man die?
-Uh....

30:00.299 --> 30:03.302
Let's see. We got here Tuesday,
so Friday the 20th.

30:03.511 --> 30:05.054
March 20th.

30:05.262 --> 30:07.097
That's the spring equinox.

30:07.306 --> 30:09.892
The night the sun and the moon
share the sky as equals.

30:10.142 --> 30:14.063
So every year about this time,
anybody in Oasis Plains is in danger.

30:14.271 --> 30:16.357
Larry built his neighborhood
on cursed land.

30:16.565 --> 30:18.526
On the sixth night, that's tonight.

30:18.609 --> 30:22.613
If we don't do something,
Larry's family will be dead by sunrise.

30:22.905 --> 30:26.116
-So how do we break a curse?
-You don't break a curse.

30:26.325 --> 30:29.537
You get out of its way. We gotta
get those people out now.

31:49.033 --> 31:52.202
Yes, Mr. Pike. There's a mainline
gas leak in your neighborhood.

31:52.411 --> 31:53.454
God. Really? How big?

31:53.662 --> 31:56.123
DEAN (ON PHONE): Fairly extensive.
I don't wanna alarm you...

31:56.332 --> 31:59.752
...but we need your family
out of the vicinity for at least 12 hours.

31:59.960 --> 32:01.837
-Just to be safe.
-Who is this again?

32:01.920 --> 32:04.715
Travis Weaver.
I work for Oklahoma Gas and Power.

32:04.798 --> 32:08.469
Uh-huh. The problem is, I know
Travis. He's worked with us for a year.

32:08.677 --> 32:10.971
-So who is this?
-Uh....

32:12.348 --> 32:14.308
Give me the phone.

32:17.436 --> 32:18.937
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

32:22.608 --> 32:24.276
MATT (ON PHONE): Hello?
-Matt, it's Sam.

32:24.485 --> 32:26.403
My back yard's crawling
with cockroaches.

32:26.612 --> 32:30.032
Matt, just listen. You have to get
your family out of that house now.

32:30.240 --> 32:31.867
What? Why?

32:32.076 --> 32:33.994
Because something's coming.

32:34.078 --> 32:37.164
MATT: More bugs.
-Yeah. A lot more.

32:37.247 --> 32:39.750
MATT: My dad doesn't listen
in the best of circumstances.

32:39.833 --> 32:42.628
-What am I supposed to tell him?
-You gotta make him listen.

32:42.711 --> 32:44.046
Give me the phone.

32:44.129 --> 32:47.132
Under no circumstances are you to tell
the truth. He'll think you're nuts.

32:47.216 --> 32:49.009
-But, he's my--
-Say you have a sharp pain...

32:49.218 --> 32:51.470
in your right side and
you gotta go to the hospital.

32:51.679 --> 32:53.972
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

32:57.184 --> 33:00.104
"Make him listen."
What are you thinking?

33:12.282 --> 33:15.077
Damn it. They're still here.
Come on.

33:21.542 --> 33:23.419
Get off my property
before I call the cops.

33:23.669 --> 33:26.505
-Mr. Pike. Listen--
-Dad, they're just trying to help.

33:26.714 --> 33:29.717
-Get in the house.
-Sorry. I told him the truth.

33:29.925 --> 33:32.553
We had a plan, Matt.
What happened to the plan?

33:32.761 --> 33:34.221
Look. It's 12 a.m.

33:34.430 --> 33:37.766
They are coming any minute now.
You need to get your family and go.

33:37.975 --> 33:41.145
-Before it's too late.
-You mean, before the biblical swarm?

33:41.353 --> 33:44.022
Larry, what do you think
really happened to that realtor?

33:44.231 --> 33:47.609
And the gas-company guy. You don't
think something weird's going on?

33:47.818 --> 33:49.987
I don't know who you are,
but you're crazy.

33:50.195 --> 33:53.657
You come near my boy or my family
again, we're gonna have a problem.

33:53.741 --> 33:58.245
-We got a problem right now.
-Dad, they're right. We're in danger.

33:58.412 --> 34:01.790
-Matt, get inside! Now!
-No! Why won't you listen to me?

34:01.999 --> 34:04.418
Because this is crazy!
It doesn't make any sense!

34:04.710 --> 34:08.464
Look, this land is cursed.
People have died here.

34:08.714 --> 34:10.632
Are you gonna take that risk
with your family?

34:10.841 --> 34:12.259
DEAN:
Wait.

34:12.551 --> 34:13.594
(RUMBLING)

34:13.802 --> 34:15.095
You hear it?

34:18.807 --> 34:19.975
What the hell?

34:20.225 --> 34:21.351
(BUGS BUZZING
AND ELECTRICITY ZAPPING)

34:24.146 --> 34:26.815
-It's time to go. Larry, get your wife.
-Yeah.

34:26.982 --> 34:28.567
MATT:
Guys?

34:31.820 --> 34:32.946
Oh, my God.

34:34.615 --> 34:35.824
SAM:
We'll never make it.

34:36.158 --> 34:39.036
Everybody in the house.
Everybody in the house! Go!

34:43.832 --> 34:46.710
-Anyone else in the neighborhood?
LARRY: No, it's just us.

34:46.794 --> 34:49.963
Honey, what's happening?
What's that noise?

34:50.839 --> 34:52.466
Call 911.

34:52.674 --> 34:54.676
-Joanie!
-Okay.

34:55.594 --> 34:57.012
-I need towels.
LARRY: The closet.

34:57.221 --> 35:00.849
We gotta lock this place up. Doors,
windows, the fireplace, everything.

35:01.058 --> 35:02.476
The phones are dead.

35:02.684 --> 35:04.645
Must have chewed
through the phone lines.

35:09.650 --> 35:13.237
-And the power lines.
-Maybe my cell....

35:15.447 --> 35:18.158
-No signal.
-You won't get one.

35:18.700 --> 35:20.661
They're blanketing the house.

35:20.994 --> 35:22.663
(CLATTERING)

35:37.010 --> 35:40.806
-So, what do we do now?
-We try to outlast it.

35:41.890 --> 35:45.811
-Hopefully the curse will end at sunrise.
-"Hopefully"?

36:07.708 --> 36:09.251
-Bug spray?
-Trust me.

36:12.504 --> 36:13.839
What is that?

36:14.506 --> 36:15.883
(FIREPLACE CREAKING)

36:23.557 --> 36:25.893
The flue.

36:26.894 --> 36:28.937
All right. I think everybody
needs to get upstairs.

Go, go, go!

JOANIE:
Hurry! Hurry, Matt!

37:13.190 --> 37:14.608
Come on!

Oh, God. What's that?

37:27.079 --> 37:28.372
(SCRAPING)

37:32.459 --> 37:34.962
Something's eating through the wood.

37:35.212 --> 37:37.214
Termites.

37:40.425 --> 37:42.302
All right. Everybody get back.
Get back!

37:42.511 --> 37:44.888
-Get back!
LARRY: Get back!

37:45.097 --> 37:46.640
JOANIE:
Matt!

Get it!

Crap.

40:02.776 --> 40:04.194
DEAN:
What, no goodbye?

40:04.402 --> 40:07.072
Good timing. Another hour
and we'd have been gone.

40:07.280 --> 40:10.450
SAM: For good?
-Yeah. The development's on hold...

40:10.659 --> 40:13.537
...while the government
investigates the bones you found.

40:13.745 --> 40:17.040
But I'm gonna make damn sure
no one lives here again.

40:17.249 --> 40:18.875
You don't seem too upset about it.

40:19.793 --> 40:23.672
Well, this has been the biggest
financial disaster of my career...

40:24.673 --> 40:26.466
...but somehow...

40:27.676 --> 40:29.052
...I really don't care.

40:44.151 --> 40:46.653
-What's this?
MATT: I don't know.

40:47.445 --> 40:50.323
They kind of weird me out now.

40:52.159 --> 40:54.703
Yeah, I should hope so.

41:14.639 --> 41:16.600
I wanna find Dad.

41:17.559 --> 41:19.352
Yeah, me too.

41:19.978 --> 41:21.813
Yeah, but I just....

41:24.316 --> 41:26.276
I wanna apologize to him.

41:29.321 --> 41:30.989
For what?

41:32.616 --> 41:35.076
All the things I said to him.

41:37.120 --> 41:39.497
He was just doing the best he could.

41:41.958 --> 41:44.753
Well, don't worry. We'll find him.

41:44.836 --> 41:46.880
And you'll apologize.

41:47.088 --> 41:49.674
And then within five minutes,
you'll be at each other's throats.

41:49.883 --> 41:51.009
(LAUGHS)

41:53.678 --> 41:55.639
Yeah, probably.

-Let's.
