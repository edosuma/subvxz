WEBVTT

00:02.611 --> 00:04.395
<i>Previously on</i> The Equalizer... Bishop!

00:04.526 --> 00:05.788
<i>I'm not asking for your trust.</i>

00:05.918 --> 00:07.355
I'm asking for your help.

00:07.485 --> 00:08.878
<i>The reason I left
the CIA is because</i>

00:09.009 --> 00:10.749
<i>I lost faith in the institution,</i>

00:10.880 --> 00:12.229
but not the mission.

00:12.360 --> 00:13.796
Trust me, you don't want
to know everything.

00:13.926 --> 00:15.189
- In fact, I do.
- Tell you what,

00:15.319 --> 00:16.755
if it seems dangerous,

00:16.886 --> 00:18.192
then I'll
let you know.

00:18.322 --> 00:19.802
Mom!

00:19.932 --> 00:21.934
<i>Mom, if you really want to help,</i>

00:22.065 --> 00:24.111
- train me.
- <i>When my dad died,</i>

00:24.241 --> 00:25.764
I had to grow up way faster
than I should've,

00:25.895 --> 00:27.418
and I don't want that for you.

00:27.549 --> 00:29.594
We took that money
to level the playing field

00:29.725 --> 00:31.379
and take care
of our families.

00:31.509 --> 00:32.815
<i>Was it really about
the family, Pop?</i>

00:32.945 --> 00:33.946
Or was it just about you?

00:34.077 --> 00:35.818
That money paid for your life.

01:00.147 --> 01:01.670
CIA! Don't move!

01:01.800 --> 01:03.106
- You heard him!
- Hey, yo!

01:03.237 --> 01:04.412
Hands up now!

01:06.370 --> 01:08.111
Hands behind your back.

01:15.771 --> 01:18.513
- Hey.
- Hey, Mom.

01:18.643 --> 01:20.080
Huh.

01:20.210 --> 01:21.777
What's all this?

01:21.907 --> 01:25.172
Hello, it's for our dinner
with Mel and harry tonight.

01:25.302 --> 01:27.478
- Mm-hmm.
- What? Is that tonight?

01:27.609 --> 01:29.045
You know it's tonight.

01:29.176 --> 01:30.525
Don't even try to get out of it.

01:30.655 --> 01:32.657
I'm not. I'm actually
looking forward to it.

01:32.788 --> 01:34.050
It's just that...

01:34.181 --> 01:35.312
It's a little weird.

01:35.443 --> 01:36.792
You know, I spent
so many years

01:36.922 --> 01:38.228
keeping my family

01:38.359 --> 01:39.708
and work separate.

01:39.838 --> 01:41.449
I know how hard
that's been on you.

01:41.579 --> 01:43.886
It's time to put
that burden down.

01:44.016 --> 01:45.801
And the way Mel
took care of us

01:45.931 --> 01:47.716
when you were abducted--

01:47.846 --> 01:49.239
she's already family.

01:49.370 --> 01:50.501
I can't wait
to meet Harry.

01:50.632 --> 01:52.677
Oh, my gosh, you're gonna
love his fits, Auntie.

01:52.808 --> 01:55.463
And, um, that nice detective?

01:55.593 --> 01:57.726
- Maybe we should invite him, too?
- Mm-mmm.

01:57.856 --> 01:59.206
Okay, now you're just
being messy.

02:00.555 --> 02:02.252
Hey, uh, I got to run.

02:02.383 --> 02:04.211
- I love y'all.
- Bye, baby.

02:04.341 --> 02:05.647
- Love you, too.
- Bye. I love you.

02:05.777 --> 02:07.039
Don't be late for dinner.
Have a good day.

02:07.170 --> 02:08.693
I promise, I won't.

02:08.824 --> 02:10.652
Same goes for you.

02:10.782 --> 02:12.349
Oh, don't worry.
I have a little work thing,

02:12.480 --> 02:13.959
but, uh, I'll be there.

02:22.881 --> 02:24.883
Aunt Vi,

02:25.014 --> 02:26.972
I haven't forgotten
our agreement,

02:27.103 --> 02:29.410
but this
is classified,

02:29.540 --> 02:31.063
and I won't be
reachable today.

02:31.194 --> 02:32.152
Well, that's convenient.

02:32.282 --> 02:33.631
It's true, though.

02:33.762 --> 02:36.678
So, you'll just have to
trust that I'll be okay,

02:36.808 --> 02:39.376
and I'll make it home
in time for dinner.

02:39.507 --> 02:40.682
You better be,

02:40.812 --> 02:42.597
'cause my escovitch
waits for no man

02:42.727 --> 02:44.294
or woman.

02:44.425 --> 02:46.731
Is that what
you're making?

02:46.862 --> 02:48.864
Okay, I won'tbe late.

02:54.304 --> 02:56.872
Kyler, what's the difference

02:57.002 --> 02:58.787
between a credit card
and a debit card?

02:58.917 --> 03:00.745
A debit card is money
from your bank account.

03:00.876 --> 03:02.878
A credit card
- is money you borrow.
- Boom.

03:03.008 --> 03:04.706
Stefon, define home equity.

03:04.836 --> 03:07.970
The value of a property
minus the debt.

03:08.100 --> 03:09.580
Kyler,

03:09.711 --> 03:12.453
what's the difference
between stocks and bonds?

03:12.583 --> 03:15.847
Stocks give you ownership
in a corporation,

03:15.978 --> 03:17.806
while bonds...

03:17.936 --> 03:21.201
Bonds, uh...
Help your brother out.

03:21.331 --> 03:24.421
Bonds are a loan from you
to a company or government?

03:24.552 --> 03:26.423
You asking me or telling me?

03:28.860 --> 03:30.732
I'm telling you.

03:30.862 --> 03:31.950
Then say it with your chest.

03:32.081 --> 03:33.430
Bonds are a loan from you

03:33.561 --> 03:34.953
to a company or government.

03:35.084 --> 03:38.043
That's right. And why
do we need to know this?

03:38.174 --> 03:41.133
Because responsibilities
take no days off.

03:41.264 --> 03:44.049
Good job. Let's eat.

03:44.180 --> 03:47.227
Pass-pass the jam.

03:54.321 --> 03:56.584
Yeah, I'll accept the charges.

03:58.760 --> 04:01.371
Pop. This is a surprise.

04:05.157 --> 04:07.769
Yeah. I'll be there.

04:10.641 --> 04:13.427
It's just a simple A to B
transfer of a detainee

04:13.557 --> 04:15.516
from here to a secure
debriefing center.

04:15.646 --> 04:17.996
Well, if it's so simple,
why do you need me?

04:18.127 --> 04:20.172
Gonna ask you
the same thing.

04:20.303 --> 04:22.436
Look, I got orders to
move a priority capture

04:22.566 --> 04:23.872
and that you were to
be part of the team.

04:24.002 --> 04:25.526
Care to explain?

04:25.656 --> 04:28.137
Well, apparently, I still
owe the Company a few favors.

04:28.268 --> 04:29.443
Who's the cargo?

04:29.573 --> 04:31.053
Smuggler named
Ezra Ryback.

04:31.183 --> 04:32.663
An on-again,
off-again asset

04:32.794 --> 04:34.056
who operates
mainly in Europe.

04:34.186 --> 04:35.536
Apparently, he's gonna be
debriefed by some

04:35.666 --> 04:37.625
top-level brass
named Colton Fisk.

04:37.755 --> 04:39.191
Colton Fisk?

04:39.322 --> 04:41.542
Yeah. You know him?

04:41.672 --> 04:44.284
I've heard of him.
And only in whispers.

04:44.414 --> 04:47.548
I mean, he's somewhere between
a myth and a legend.

04:47.678 --> 04:49.550
In fact, I don't know anyone
who's actually met him.

04:49.680 --> 04:51.552
I used to think he was made-up,
you know?

04:51.682 --> 04:53.597
Some kind of boogeyman
to scare cadets.

04:53.728 --> 04:55.164
Wait a minute,

04:55.295 --> 04:57.209
I have heard
about this guy.

04:57.340 --> 04:59.734
He made his bones as a
- spy hunter in the '90s, right?
- Yeah, they say

04:59.864 --> 05:01.910
he single-handily
took down all the top levels

05:02.040 --> 05:04.347
of FSB and MSS.

05:04.478 --> 05:06.262
I know this:
if Fisk is doing

05:06.393 --> 05:09.134
the debrief, this guy Ryback
must be important.

05:12.355 --> 05:13.617
Turn in your phones.

05:14.749 --> 05:16.272
Say that again,
see what happens.

05:16.403 --> 05:18.448
- Is this our cargo?
- Yup. Real piece of work

05:18.579 --> 05:20.320
from what I hear.

05:20.450 --> 05:22.191
All right, well,
let's make this quick.

05:22.322 --> 05:23.540
I got plans tonight.

05:27.892 --> 05:30.852
McCall, this is Agent Shaw,

05:30.982 --> 05:32.941
Agent Sanford. They'll be on
the transport with us today.

05:33.071 --> 05:34.464
Nice to meet you.

05:34.595 --> 05:37.293
Hey, you. Million dollars
if you put a bullet

05:37.424 --> 05:38.729
in each of their
skulls right now.

05:38.860 --> 05:40.078
Why don't you shut up, Ryback.

05:40.209 --> 05:41.776
I'm happy to
do it myself.

05:43.038 --> 05:43.865
I'm happy for you to try it.

05:43.995 --> 05:45.519
All right, let's get going.

05:45.649 --> 05:46.998
Wait a second,
is this really it?

05:47.129 --> 05:49.305
No convoy?
Just four boot camp

05:49.436 --> 05:50.654
drop-outs
with pea shooters?

05:50.785 --> 05:53.004
Clearly, you do not
know who I am.

05:53.135 --> 05:55.398
Oh, we know. We're just
doing our best to forget.

05:55.529 --> 05:58.445
Trust me sweetie,
you will never forget me.

05:59.794 --> 06:01.273
Let's get him to the van.

06:06.191 --> 06:08.585
Marcus.

06:08.716 --> 06:10.631
Thanks for coming.

06:13.068 --> 06:15.592
Sure, Pop.

06:15.723 --> 06:16.811
How you been?

06:16.941 --> 06:19.117
I'm hanging in there.

06:19.248 --> 06:20.641
Those boys behaving?

06:21.642 --> 06:23.208
They're good.

06:23.339 --> 06:25.254
Look, you wanted to see me.
Here I am.

06:26.298 --> 06:27.735
Before you hear it
on the streets,

06:27.865 --> 06:29.954
I thought you should
hear it from me.

06:30.085 --> 06:31.652
I cut a deal with the D.A.

06:31.782 --> 06:33.610
to testify in a case.

06:33.741 --> 06:35.177
Testify?

06:35.307 --> 06:37.179
So, that means... I could be getting out soon.

06:37.309 --> 06:39.616
Like, in the next few weeks.

06:41.618 --> 06:44.447
That's good, Pop.
I'm happy for you.

06:44.578 --> 06:46.231
Are you?

06:46.362 --> 06:48.799
'Cause I know
what happy looks like.

06:48.930 --> 06:50.279
That ain't it.

06:50.410 --> 06:52.455
It's just... unexpected.

06:52.586 --> 06:54.065
You've been offered deals
like this before,

06:54.196 --> 06:55.502
you always
turned them down.

06:55.632 --> 06:56.241
Seems the people
I've been

06:56.372 --> 06:57.895
protecting are either gone

06:58.026 --> 07:00.463
or locked up for things
I can't help them with.

07:00.594 --> 07:03.031
So, what do you need from me?

07:03.161 --> 07:04.772
Money? Job?
Place to stay?

07:06.643 --> 07:08.515
You think I called you
for money?

07:08.645 --> 07:10.734
- I can take care of myself, boy.
- Okay, so you don't

07:10.865 --> 07:12.693
need anything from me.

07:15.086 --> 07:16.566
Well, there is something.

07:17.915 --> 07:19.613
I want to meet your boys.

07:20.831 --> 07:23.791
My grandkids. Be a
part of their lives.

07:23.921 --> 07:26.924
Look, I know
I wasn't the best father,

07:27.055 --> 07:29.144
but I was doing what
I thought was right

07:29.274 --> 07:31.146
to prepare you
for this world.

07:31.276 --> 07:33.061
Being in here all these years

07:33.191 --> 07:36.630
gave me the perspective to...

07:36.760 --> 07:38.849
think on all that.

07:38.980 --> 07:40.329
The mistakes I made with you.

07:40.460 --> 07:43.071
Also about
the past and

07:43.201 --> 07:45.203
how much future I got left.

07:46.596 --> 07:49.033
So...

07:49.164 --> 07:51.688
I'm asking.

07:51.819 --> 07:54.604
Will you give me the chance
to know my grandsons, Marcus?

08:00.392 --> 08:02.394
Hey.

08:02.525 --> 08:04.614
That cash offer's
still on the table.

08:04.745 --> 08:06.573
Seriously, take
these cuffs off

08:06.703 --> 08:09.140
- and look the other way.
- Give it a rest, Ryback.

08:09.271 --> 08:11.316
Who are you, anyway?
Clearly, you're not

08:11.447 --> 08:13.405
one of them.
Agency run out

08:13.536 --> 08:15.973
of pros, start bringing
in mall cops?

08:19.237 --> 08:20.848
Was that a bus?

08:20.978 --> 08:23.024
We're not taking
main roads, are we?

08:23.154 --> 08:25.505
What genius planned this route?
We're exposed

08:25.635 --> 08:27.245
on all sides
to an attack.

08:27.376 --> 08:29.509
An attack from who? Nobody even
knows you're in the country.

08:29.639 --> 08:32.990
If you believe that you
- are as stupid as you look.
- What's he talking about?

08:33.121 --> 08:34.601
It's nothing important,
- I'm sure.
- Oh, yeah,

08:34.731 --> 08:36.820
the Brigada-7 cartel
is not important.

08:36.951 --> 08:39.301
Why would the Brigada-7
be after you?

08:41.433 --> 08:43.348
You got intel on them,
don't you?

08:44.393 --> 08:46.003
That's why the CIA
wants to talk to you so badly.

08:46.134 --> 08:48.963
Or he's just making stuff up
to trade for his freedom.

08:49.093 --> 08:50.660
I know this much:

08:50.791 --> 08:52.923
the Brigada have eyes and ears
in a lot of places,

08:53.054 --> 08:54.490
and from what I hear,
that includes

08:54.621 --> 08:57.101
the upper levels of the CIA.

08:58.755 --> 09:01.932
A mole in the Agency brass?

09:03.717 --> 09:05.370
You've said a lot
of stupid things, Ryback,

09:05.501 --> 09:06.676
but that one tops 'em all.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.248
<i>Our inside man was right.</i>

09:13.378 --> 09:15.206
<i>The van is on schedule.</i>

09:26.217 --> 09:27.436
♪ So good in that... ♪

09:27.567 --> 09:28.916
Hey, Mel.
What?

09:29.046 --> 09:31.005
Delilah, what are you
doing here?

09:31.135 --> 09:32.963
Hey, wait, the dinner
is still on tonight, yeah?

09:33.094 --> 09:35.009
Yes, yes, yes,
of course. Um... Okay. Mm.

09:35.139 --> 09:37.228
I actually, I just wanted
to speak with you.

09:37.359 --> 09:38.534
Yeah.

09:38.665 --> 09:41.232
Um... it's about my mom.

09:41.363 --> 09:43.626
Well, me and my mom.

09:43.757 --> 09:45.280
Sure. What's up?

09:45.410 --> 09:46.890
I asked her to train me.

09:47.021 --> 09:48.762
You know,
how to fight,

09:48.892 --> 09:50.111
protect myself.

09:50.241 --> 09:51.286
And she said no.

09:51.416 --> 09:53.114
She did.

09:53.244 --> 09:55.159
- Mm-hmm.
- Which I understand.

09:55.290 --> 09:57.118
She doesn't want me
to grow up so fast.

09:57.248 --> 09:59.033
And it's too late
for that, isn't it?

09:59.163 --> 10:01.165
Right. [chuckles]

10:01.296 --> 10:02.863
See, look, this--
I knew you would understand,

10:02.993 --> 10:06.344
which is why
I came here to ask...

10:06.475 --> 10:08.042
will you train me?

10:09.826 --> 10:12.220
You want me to...

10:12.350 --> 10:13.917
go behind your mother's back?

10:14.048 --> 10:15.745
I just want to be prepared.

10:17.312 --> 10:19.314
Dee, that's...

10:19.444 --> 10:20.837
Look,

10:20.968 --> 10:23.579
you were shaken up
after the abduction,

10:23.710 --> 10:26.364
understandably so... No, no, no, it's
more than that.

10:26.495 --> 10:28.671
Uh, what about the next time
something happens to Mom?

10:28.802 --> 10:30.542
And-and-and what about

10:30.673 --> 10:32.719
if we're there when she's home,
and-and they come after...

10:32.849 --> 10:35.330
Delilah, your mother
would never let that happen.

10:35.460 --> 10:36.679
I mean, she never thought
that she'd be kidnapped

10:36.810 --> 10:38.159
in front of us either.

10:38.289 --> 10:40.248
I know that

10:40.378 --> 10:44.078
both of you believe that
she can protect me, but...

10:44.208 --> 10:46.384
there are things
that she can't control.

10:46.515 --> 10:49.910
Mel, I know that
this is a big deal,

10:50.040 --> 10:50.998
and I don't want you
to do something

10:51.128 --> 10:52.826
that you don't
feel comfortable with,

10:52.956 --> 10:54.392
so if you want
to say no,

10:54.523 --> 10:56.481
it's okay.

10:56.612 --> 10:59.484
I appreciate that.

10:59.615 --> 11:02.444
And, honey, unfortunately,

11:02.574 --> 11:05.665
I have to take you up
on that offer and say no.

11:08.624 --> 11:10.582
- Okay. I understand.
- Um...

11:10.713 --> 11:12.933
Where you going?

11:14.238 --> 11:15.979
I respect
your decision,

11:16.110 --> 11:17.459
but,

11:17.589 --> 11:20.636
Mel, I got to look out
for me, so...

11:20.767 --> 11:22.899
if you're not gonna train me,

11:23.030 --> 11:24.684
I'll find someone who will.

11:34.041 --> 11:35.738
How much longer's
this gonna take?

11:35.869 --> 11:37.174
You got someplaceto be?

11:37.305 --> 11:38.828
Really worried about
the Brigada-7, aren't you?

11:38.959 --> 11:40.961
Yes, and your
complete inability

11:41.091 --> 11:43.050
- to protect me from them.
- Relax, Ryback.

11:43.180 --> 11:44.747
We'll get you
where you're going.

11:44.878 --> 11:46.357
Overconfident.

11:46.488 --> 11:49.578
There's a saying
about people like you.

11:54.888 --> 11:56.716
"The only thing
more dangerous

11:56.846 --> 11:57.673
"than deceiving others

11:57.804 --> 11:59.501
is deceiving yourself."

11:59.631 --> 12:02.460
Mall cop knows Arabic.

12:02.591 --> 12:03.679
I'm impressed.

12:03.810 --> 12:05.507
Where'd you hear that saying?

12:05.637 --> 12:06.682
Another agent.

12:06.813 --> 12:08.379
Except this guy
was actually good

12:08.510 --> 12:09.337
at his job.

12:09.467 --> 12:10.730
The best.

12:10.860 --> 12:12.644
What was his name?

12:12.775 --> 12:15.822
He only went by one. Bishop.

12:18.868 --> 12:20.478
You know him?

12:20.609 --> 12:22.524
I'm familiar.

12:22.654 --> 12:24.526
Where is he, anyway?
I was certain

12:24.656 --> 12:26.310
he'd be on this detail
since it's me.

12:33.404 --> 12:35.450
Unless...

12:35.580 --> 12:36.886
He's dead, isn't he?

12:39.759 --> 12:41.151
Why are we stopping?

12:41.282 --> 12:42.979
Don't worry.
It's a planned vehicle switch.

12:43.110 --> 12:44.720
Don't worry?

12:44.851 --> 12:46.853
You just don't get it.

12:54.338 --> 12:56.993
Watch it, baby, it's hot.

12:57.124 --> 12:58.778
Thanks for coming over, Mom.

12:59.909 --> 13:01.693
I like your new place.

13:01.824 --> 13:04.348
Honey, you sure
you can afford this?

13:04.479 --> 13:06.046
Even with the
Gatling County settlement?

13:06.176 --> 13:08.613
It was pretty substantial.

13:10.354 --> 13:11.747
Yeah, it's not enough money
in the world

13:11.878 --> 13:13.488
to make up for what
they put you through.

13:17.666 --> 13:18.972
Wait!

13:21.757 --> 13:24.455
So, what are you
gonna do with it all?

13:25.935 --> 13:28.677
Still trying to figure that out.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.461
Just doesn't feel right.

13:30.592 --> 13:32.376
Hm.

13:32.507 --> 13:35.423
Honey, I know it came
from a dark place,

13:35.553 --> 13:38.861
but it's a lot of good
you can do with it.

13:41.342 --> 13:42.560
Anyway...

13:42.691 --> 13:44.084
I'm sure you have
mixed feelings

13:44.214 --> 13:45.912
about your father
being released.

13:46.042 --> 13:47.435
I just hope you can

13:47.565 --> 13:49.829
find it in your heart one day
to forgive him.

13:52.570 --> 13:54.224
When I talked to him, Pop asked

13:54.355 --> 13:56.836
about spending time
with the boys.

13:56.966 --> 13:58.620
Feels like it would give him
a second chance.

13:58.750 --> 14:00.622
I see.

14:00.752 --> 14:02.450
What did Vanessa say?

14:02.580 --> 14:05.409
She's always believed
family is important.

14:05.540 --> 14:07.803
Wants our boys
to know their grandfather,

14:07.934 --> 14:09.413
as long as I'm okay with it.

14:09.544 --> 14:10.937
Are you?

14:11.067 --> 14:13.374
Should I be?

14:15.550 --> 14:17.334
I don't know.

14:19.946 --> 14:22.470
You know I want nothing
but happiness for that man,

14:22.600 --> 14:26.039
but not at the expense
of yours. I mean,

14:26.169 --> 14:30.260
being in your life,
being in your children's lives--

14:30.391 --> 14:33.133
that's not a right,
it's a privilege.

14:33.263 --> 14:35.091
He needs to earn that.

14:35.222 --> 14:37.877
Honey, I know
he was hard on you.

14:38.007 --> 14:39.443
At the end of the day,

14:39.574 --> 14:42.055
it's a decision
only you can make, baby.

14:44.144 --> 14:45.972
Want more coffee, dear?

15:25.707 --> 15:26.621
Let's go.

15:29.667 --> 15:31.756
What do you make of
all this Brigada-7 talk?

15:31.887 --> 15:33.193
Should we be worried?

15:33.323 --> 15:35.543
I tangled with their
New York arm a while back,

15:35.673 --> 15:37.197
and they're no joke.

15:38.372 --> 15:39.677
Any chance Ryback is right?

15:39.808 --> 15:41.331
About a mole?

15:41.462 --> 15:43.986
I got to say, it would
explain a few things.

15:44.117 --> 15:47.163
Past month alone, I had a
dead asset and an investigation

15:47.294 --> 15:49.122
suddenly shut down
from above.

15:49.252 --> 15:51.559
Agent Johnson,
it's time to switch.

15:51.689 --> 15:54.127
We're compromised.

15:54.257 --> 15:55.780
Brigada must have found out
we have Ryback.

15:58.740 --> 16:00.394
We're pinned down.
Shooters at two o'clock.

16:00.524 --> 16:02.178
- Get him to safety.
- Ryback, get in the van.

16:04.659 --> 16:06.052
Move!

16:29.031 --> 16:30.641
Where's Ryback?

16:30.772 --> 16:32.469
He's in the van.

16:43.915 --> 16:45.091
How could Ryback just disappear?

16:45.221 --> 16:45.787
He couldn't have gone far.

16:45.917 --> 16:47.702
Everybody, spread out.

16:50.574 --> 16:51.836
Check and see.

17:08.201 --> 17:09.028
Ryback, it's me!

17:12.944 --> 17:15.034
Never thought I'd say this, but

17:15.164 --> 17:17.253
I'm actually happy to see you.

17:17.384 --> 17:18.515
Damn.

17:18.646 --> 17:20.169
Hold still.

17:22.084 --> 17:23.999
You're lucky, it's just grazed.

17:24.130 --> 17:26.567
Easy.

17:26.697 --> 17:28.177
The hell were you thinking,
running off like that?

17:28.308 --> 17:29.613
- That I want to survive.
- And you think

17:29.744 --> 17:30.875
you have a better shot
on your own?

17:31.006 --> 17:32.355
You disagree?

17:32.486 --> 17:33.878
It's pretty clear your operation
was compromised.

17:34.009 --> 17:35.489
Did you see who was
leading that hit squad?

17:35.619 --> 17:36.881
Dimitri Muller.

17:37.012 --> 17:38.361
Muller?

17:38.492 --> 17:39.667
The Bridgada's
go-to assassin.

17:39.797 --> 17:41.321
He's got 100% kill rate.

17:41.451 --> 17:44.498
Well, I have
a 100% survival rate,

17:44.628 --> 17:46.935
so maybe you want
to stick with me next time.

17:48.154 --> 17:49.459
He's okay.

17:49.590 --> 17:51.635
- What the hell, Ryback?
- I told you there was a leak.

17:51.766 --> 17:53.333
But would you listen?
No.

17:53.463 --> 17:55.074
"What the hell does he know
about the Brigada-7?"

17:55.204 --> 17:57.859
Only enough that your boss
Colton Fisk wants to debrief me.

17:57.989 --> 17:59.034
He's right about this one.

17:59.165 --> 18:00.253
Someone knew our
entire route.

18:00.383 --> 18:02.472
Down to the location
of the switch.

18:02.603 --> 18:04.213
Which means they know
where we're headed.

18:04.344 --> 18:05.736
Can't call in for backup.

18:05.867 --> 18:07.999
Not if there's a mole waiting
to intercept the new plan.

18:08.130 --> 18:09.175
We have to go
off-grid.

18:09.305 --> 18:11.307
Someplace no one
will look for us.

18:12.656 --> 18:14.354
I know a place.

18:15.703 --> 18:17.531
Put your hands up, Kevin.
Protect your face.

18:17.661 --> 18:19.881
Jab. There you go.

18:20.011 --> 18:22.536
Good, Dante. Let's go.

18:22.666 --> 18:25.669
Oh, no. Keep-keep...
keep the left hand up.

18:25.800 --> 18:27.541
Higher! Higher! You got
to protect yourself.

18:27.671 --> 18:30.544
<i>That the best you can do?</i>

18:30.674 --> 18:32.502
Somebody hits you,
you hit them back

18:32.633 --> 18:35.549
<i>twice as hard.
You're an embarrassment, boy.</i>

18:38.204 --> 18:39.379
Dante!

18:39.509 --> 18:40.554
We're just sparring.

18:42.033 --> 18:43.209
Hey, man, you all right?

18:43.339 --> 18:44.906
My bad, man.

18:45.036 --> 18:46.777
Hey, it's okay.

18:50.694 --> 18:52.783
The hell is
wrong with you?

18:53.828 --> 18:55.873
Sorry, man.
Guess I got carried away.

18:56.004 --> 18:57.701
I'm just working
through some stuff.

18:58.746 --> 19:02.141
Everybody around here
is working through some stuff.

19:08.016 --> 19:10.453
Listen to me. If you
need an ear to bend,

19:10.584 --> 19:13.108
you know where to find me.

19:15.110 --> 19:17.330
Hey, what about you?

19:18.809 --> 19:20.333
Seem grumpier than usual.

19:20.463 --> 19:22.770
Just trying to come to terms
with these numbers, brother.

19:22.900 --> 19:24.467
What numbers?

19:24.598 --> 19:28.167
Expenses are up,
membership is down.

19:28.297 --> 19:30.212
The math ain't mathing
the way it used to, you know?

19:30.343 --> 19:32.083
Anything I can do?

19:32.214 --> 19:34.303
I mean, you can enjoy it
while you still can.

19:36.610 --> 19:38.829
I'm, uh,

19:38.960 --> 19:41.658
probably gonna have to
close the doors soon.

19:41.789 --> 19:43.878
Damn, Manny.

19:44.008 --> 19:46.663
Your dad opened this place
when I was this high.

19:46.794 --> 19:48.970
You know what this place means

19:49.100 --> 19:50.798
to the neighborhood, how many
kids you kept out of trouble

19:50.928 --> 19:52.278
by giving 'em somewhere to be?

19:52.408 --> 19:54.323
Yeah, and I loved
every minute of it.

19:54.454 --> 19:56.151
That ain't gonna
pay this mortgage.

19:56.282 --> 19:57.674
What about a fundraiser?

19:59.807 --> 20:02.766
And end up in the same spot
couple of months down the road?

20:02.897 --> 20:05.465
Nah, I've, uh...

20:05.595 --> 20:07.945
I've made peace with it.

20:08.076 --> 20:10.296
If that's what you want.

20:10.426 --> 20:13.603
Wasn't my call. You know,
sometimes life just...

20:13.734 --> 20:15.953
lets you know

20:16.084 --> 20:18.260
when it's time to move on.

20:19.783 --> 20:21.481
Still a shame.

20:21.611 --> 20:24.005
Gonna miss this place.

20:24.135 --> 20:26.312
We all are.

20:29.097 --> 20:30.838
You ready to go?

20:30.968 --> 20:32.361
Yeah. What should we bring?
A, uh,

20:32.492 --> 20:34.624
a full-bodied red
with silky tannins

20:34.755 --> 20:37.018
or a buttery white
sort of sexed-up

20:37.148 --> 20:39.542
with a flinty nuance at the end?

20:41.240 --> 20:42.850
Uh-oh.

20:42.980 --> 20:45.635
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. I'm-I'm...

20:45.766 --> 20:47.158
No, no. Come on.

20:47.289 --> 20:49.726
Don't want to do this dance.
What's going on?

20:51.728 --> 20:53.339
Delilah?
It's Delilah.

20:55.341 --> 20:57.473
Was I wrong to say no?

20:57.604 --> 20:59.867
I mean, Rob would definitely
find out, and she'd be pissed.

20:59.997 --> 21:01.172
I would be pissed
if I were her.

21:01.303 --> 21:02.696
Oh, yeah.
No, that would definitely

21:02.826 --> 21:04.263
create some major drama.

21:07.701 --> 21:11.095
But... am I actually

21:11.226 --> 21:12.445
letting Rob down?

21:12.575 --> 21:14.838
Look, she's not
ready to accept

21:14.969 --> 21:17.276
that an incident like this
could happen again, but...

21:17.406 --> 21:19.408
No, I know.
The kid's not wrong.

21:19.539 --> 21:21.802
It could definitely
- happen again.
- Yeah.

21:21.932 --> 21:23.630
And she's determined.

21:23.760 --> 21:27.460
She's gonna do it
with or without me.

21:27.590 --> 21:29.810
And I don't know where
she's gonna go.

21:35.555 --> 21:37.774
Remember when I was
stationed in Kandahar

21:37.905 --> 21:39.428
and those recruits
came in for processing

21:39.559 --> 21:42.344
and I could tell in two seconds
they were not ready?

21:42.475 --> 21:44.738
And I begged
Command to just

21:44.868 --> 21:46.087
let me train them,
but I was told it was not

21:46.217 --> 21:48.263
logistically feasible.

21:48.394 --> 21:49.917
So they were trained
by somebody else

21:50.047 --> 21:52.049
with less experience,
and then just...

21:54.878 --> 21:56.271
They weren't much
older than Delilah.

21:56.402 --> 21:58.142
They should have
let me train them.

21:58.273 --> 22:00.231
Okay.'Cause then...

22:00.362 --> 22:02.277
No. No, no.
That was not your fault.

22:02.408 --> 22:03.800
- Mm-hmm.
- That was not your fault.

22:03.931 --> 22:06.760
- Okay?
- Okay.

22:06.890 --> 22:09.806
But if Delilah
is not ready

22:09.937 --> 22:12.461
when the time comes...

22:12.592 --> 22:14.898
- that will be my fault.
- I don't know.

22:15.029 --> 22:18.162
Uh, it's true, there's
nobody better qualified

22:18.293 --> 22:19.816
to train her than you.
I mean, that's...

22:19.947 --> 22:21.340
So you think
- I should do it.
- Wait, wait, wait.

22:21.470 --> 22:23.907
- I-I did not say that.
- So what are you saying?

22:24.038 --> 22:26.649
I'm saying, you know...

22:26.780 --> 22:28.042
I'm glad I'm not you.

22:29.696 --> 22:31.001
- Okay, all right, all right.
- Really?

22:31.132 --> 22:32.307
Look, look, look. Look...

22:32.438 --> 22:35.136
listening is-is my forte. Okay?

22:35.266 --> 22:37.094
Good decision-making--
that's always been your thing.

22:37.225 --> 22:39.793
Right? I mean, look,
you chose me.

22:39.923 --> 22:41.403
Right.

22:41.534 --> 22:44.014
Look, it's a tough call,
you know,

22:44.145 --> 22:47.322
but whatever you decide
is going to be the right call.

22:47.453 --> 22:49.672
All right? And I will
support it no matter what.

22:49.803 --> 22:52.545
Okay?

22:52.675 --> 22:54.982
- Okay.
- Okay.

22:55.112 --> 22:57.158
Now I just got to...

22:57.288 --> 22:58.812
figure out which one of these...

22:58.942 --> 23:00.640
Uh...

23:03.599 --> 23:04.600
Come on, we're gonna be late.

23:08.474 --> 23:10.519
You just happen to have
an abandoned warehouse

23:10.650 --> 23:12.347
lying around?
Resourceful.

23:12.478 --> 23:13.740
Who are you, anyway?

23:13.870 --> 23:15.568
I'm the person
who's saving your ass.

23:15.698 --> 23:18.397
Okay, we're here, we're safe.
Now we need to call this in.

23:18.527 --> 23:20.094
We've already been
compromised once.

23:20.224 --> 23:21.400
We go straight to the director.

23:21.530 --> 23:22.488
What part of
"you can't trust anyone"

23:22.618 --> 23:23.880
don't you get?

23:24.011 --> 23:25.186
I agree with Ryback.

23:25.316 --> 23:27.797
He's been right
more than you have.

23:27.928 --> 23:30.060
Who you calling?

23:30.191 --> 23:31.497
The only reinforcements
I trust.

23:31.627 --> 23:32.759
Bishop Security.

23:32.889 --> 23:34.325
Involving a civilian
third party?

23:34.456 --> 23:35.762
That's a violation of protocol.

23:35.892 --> 23:37.764
CIA's protocol, not mine.

23:37.894 --> 23:40.462
Bishop Security is the only
tactical fighting force

23:40.593 --> 23:42.638
that we can be sure
is not compromised.

23:42.769 --> 23:44.423
Yeah, sorry, I can't
let you do that.

23:44.553 --> 23:46.120
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

23:46.250 --> 23:48.122
What the hell are
you doing, Sanford?

23:48.252 --> 23:49.297
She's the outsider.

23:49.428 --> 23:50.733
She's the one
who left the CIA

23:50.864 --> 23:51.908
for reasons no one
seems to know.

23:52.039 --> 23:54.171
Take it easy, okay?

23:54.302 --> 23:56.435
We can talk this through.

23:56.565 --> 23:58.872
Maybe you're the mole. Huh?

23:59.002 --> 24:00.874
How do we know that
you haven't led us here

24:01.004 --> 24:02.310
just to be sitting ducks?

24:03.703 --> 24:05.052
Sanford, get away
from the window!

24:05.182 --> 24:05.835
I said I'm done
listening to you!

24:18.718 --> 24:20.981
He's gone.

24:25.855 --> 24:26.813
All right, everybody listen up.

24:26.943 --> 24:29.424
That sniper means
the Brigada-7 kill squad

24:29.555 --> 24:30.425
is either on the way...

24:30.556 --> 24:31.513
Or already here.

24:31.644 --> 24:32.949
How the hell did they find us?

24:33.080 --> 24:34.298
They must have followed us
from the garage.

24:34.429 --> 24:35.256
Maybe you told them.

24:35.386 --> 24:36.866
You think I'm the mole?

24:36.997 --> 24:38.955
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Shut up, Ryback.

24:39.086 --> 24:40.914
There's no time for
you nonsense right now.

24:41.044 --> 24:42.350
So what the hell are
we supposed to do,

24:42.481 --> 24:44.308
stand around and get
picked off one by one?

24:44.439 --> 24:45.484
We prepare.

24:45.614 --> 24:47.007
There are two ways
into this place:

24:47.137 --> 24:48.399
the front and the rear.

24:48.530 --> 24:49.575
We set up positions,

24:49.705 --> 24:50.967
and when they breach,

24:51.098 --> 24:53.230
we'll be waiting for them
with a surprise.

24:53.361 --> 24:55.885
With what-- four handguns
and a few rounds of ammo?

25:04.328 --> 25:05.155
You know, I am really beginning

25:05.286 --> 25:06.722
to warm up to you.

25:08.115 --> 25:09.072
Shaw and I will
take the front.

25:09.203 --> 25:10.813
Ryback, Griffin, the rear.

25:10.944 --> 25:13.120
Are you sure
that's a good idea?

25:13.250 --> 25:15.557
We need all the help
we can get.

25:22.303 --> 25:25.436
You try something,
I'll shoot you myself.

25:25.567 --> 25:27.787
I expect nothing less.

25:29.266 --> 25:31.399
Ryback with a gun?
I don't trust him.

25:31.530 --> 25:34.707
Look, he's off the rails,
but he's not crazy.

25:34.837 --> 25:36.665
He wants to live.

25:39.712 --> 25:40.756
Let's go.

25:42.497 --> 25:43.672
What's up?

25:43.803 --> 25:45.848
Nothing.

25:45.979 --> 25:47.284
All right,
let's get in position

25:47.415 --> 25:48.982
before our guests arrive.

25:51.724 --> 25:54.640
- Hey. Hi!
- Hi. Hello.

25:54.770 --> 25:56.859
- It's great to see you.
- You, too.

25:56.990 --> 25:59.035
Okay, Aunt Vi,
this is Harry.

25:59.166 --> 26:00.602
I'm a hugger,
I'm coming in.

26:00.733 --> 26:02.125
Okay, let's do it.

26:02.256 --> 26:03.605
- Hey.
- Hey.

26:03.736 --> 26:05.738
- Hello.
- Hello, hello. Hi.

26:05.868 --> 26:08.697
Um, we brought this
for you.

26:08.828 --> 26:11.613
Oh. Excellent taste
in wine.

26:11.744 --> 26:13.136
And you...

26:13.267 --> 26:15.530
you have excellent taste
in spices.

26:15.661 --> 26:17.488
Is that a Scotch bonnet pepper

26:17.619 --> 26:19.578
- I detect?
- What you know about
a Scotch bonnet pepper?

26:19.708 --> 26:21.492
And I never divulge
a family recipe

26:21.623 --> 26:23.582
until I've had a few glasses
of this, anyway.

26:23.712 --> 26:25.322
Well, what are we waiting for?
Let's get it flowing.

26:25.453 --> 26:27.934
Come on. Oh, I
like him already.

26:28.064 --> 26:29.588
Good.

26:31.111 --> 26:32.460
Look, Dee, I'm just... I shouldn't...

26:35.071 --> 26:36.029
Can we just forget
about this?

26:36.159 --> 26:37.683
- Yes. Yes.
- Okay.

26:37.813 --> 26:38.901
Come on, let me
show you around.

26:39.032 --> 26:40.076
- Oh, I can't wait.
- Okay.

26:40.207 --> 26:42.557
Your mom's not back yet?

26:42.688 --> 26:44.733
Uh, no. I'm sure she's just
wrapping things up at work.

26:44.864 --> 26:48.041
- Come on.
- Sure.

26:48.171 --> 26:49.912
You really think
someone on the inside

26:50.043 --> 26:51.610
- is selling us out?
- I learned the hard way

26:51.740 --> 26:52.915
not to rule anything out.

26:53.046 --> 26:54.221
Especially with the CIA.

26:57.441 --> 26:59.879
Shaw, your six!

27:12.500 --> 27:14.458
Aah!

27:14.589 --> 27:16.809
Shaw, do you hear me?

27:24.468 --> 27:25.513
All right, just
keep pressure on it.

27:25.644 --> 27:27.733
We need to help Griffin.

27:29.082 --> 27:30.126
Cover me, Ryback!

28:23.571 --> 28:25.791
Shaw!

28:27.749 --> 28:28.924
Somebody in this room

28:29.055 --> 28:31.013
led that hit squad
directly to us.

28:31.144 --> 28:33.276
And one of y'all
better start talking.

28:34.451 --> 28:36.236
Or I'll make sure
and kill you both.

28:46.855 --> 28:49.771
Guns down.
Now!

28:51.164 --> 28:53.514
Which one of y'all
led that Brigada team here?

28:53.644 --> 28:55.081
Easy, McCall.

28:55.211 --> 28:57.083
They must have followed
us from the garage.

28:57.213 --> 29:00.216
I know when I'm being followed.
I wasn't.

29:00.347 --> 29:01.827
How do you know
it wasn't Sanford or Shaw?

29:01.957 --> 29:02.784
Because they're dead.

29:02.915 --> 29:05.091
But you two are still alive.

29:05.221 --> 29:07.528
Maybe you're not as good
as you think you are.

29:09.748 --> 29:10.836
Roll up your sleeves.

29:10.966 --> 29:12.576
Show me your arms.

29:18.234 --> 29:20.062
Now you, Griffin.

29:20.193 --> 29:21.368
This is ridiculous.

29:21.498 --> 29:22.935
Just do it!

29:28.244 --> 29:29.855
The other one.

29:37.558 --> 29:39.168
What are we looking at?

29:39.299 --> 29:42.563
A subcutaneous tracking device.

29:42.693 --> 29:45.305
Don't do it.
I'll shoot you right now.

29:48.874 --> 29:51.224
It was you all the time.

29:51.354 --> 29:53.966
You were the one
that gave me up to Quinn.

29:54.096 --> 29:55.532
Mom!

29:55.663 --> 29:57.970
It was you
who poisoned Delgado

29:58.100 --> 29:59.754
so he wouldn't tell us
about that dirty bomb.

30:01.582 --> 30:03.366
What happened?

30:03.497 --> 30:05.760
You let Quinn grab your gun
on that rooftop.

30:10.069 --> 30:12.201
You're the one who told Quinn

30:12.332 --> 30:13.812
that Bishop was on that plane.

30:16.727 --> 30:17.685
I didn't have a choice.

30:17.816 --> 30:19.643
You always have a choice!

30:19.774 --> 30:22.255
What could they possibly

30:22.385 --> 30:23.647
have offered you?

30:23.778 --> 30:26.563
It wasn't like that.

30:26.694 --> 30:30.132
I got shot
in a raid.

30:30.263 --> 30:33.440
While I was recovering,
I-I got hooked.

30:33.570 --> 30:35.616
Opioids.

30:35.746 --> 30:37.792
One night I got into
it with a dealer.

30:37.923 --> 30:41.143
I shot him.

30:41.274 --> 30:43.058
He turned out to be L.E.O.

30:43.189 --> 30:45.931
You killed an undercover cop?
Back up!

30:48.237 --> 30:49.499
Tried to
cover it up.

30:51.110 --> 30:52.328
But somehow...

30:52.459 --> 30:53.982
Brigada found out.

30:55.941 --> 30:57.986
And once they get
their hooks into you...

30:59.814 --> 31:01.555
I didn't have a way out.

31:01.685 --> 31:03.600
Yes, you did.

31:05.602 --> 31:06.952
But you're a coward.

31:10.259 --> 31:12.044
But you're gonna
turn yourself in.

31:12.174 --> 31:14.829
And spend the rest of my life
in prison?

31:17.963 --> 31:19.747
I can't do that.

31:23.664 --> 31:26.928
I'm not leaving you a choice.

31:27.059 --> 31:29.975
On three, I'm pulling this gun.

31:30.105 --> 31:33.413
You better not miss, McCall.

31:33.543 --> 31:34.805
'Cause I won't.

31:36.459 --> 31:38.548
One...

31:38.679 --> 31:40.246
Two, three,

31:40.376 --> 31:41.464
four!

31:43.379 --> 31:44.641
Hands! Hands!

31:44.772 --> 31:46.121
CIA! No one move.

31:46.252 --> 31:48.080
Watch him.

31:50.691 --> 31:52.693
Agent Duffy.

31:52.823 --> 31:55.870
McCall? Long time.

31:56.001 --> 31:57.089
They said you
might be here.

31:57.219 --> 31:59.961
Who said? How did you know
we were here?

32:00.092 --> 32:01.920
Look, we heard about the garage.

32:02.050 --> 32:03.530
Been searching for your team
ever since.

32:03.660 --> 32:05.575
That didn't answer my question.

32:05.706 --> 32:07.055
I don't know
what's going on,

32:07.186 --> 32:10.363
but I'm gonna
get some answers.

32:10.493 --> 32:12.582
Duffy.

32:14.236 --> 32:17.196
Colton Fisk
has to debrief this one.

32:17.326 --> 32:18.719
Don't worry,
we'll get him there.

32:18.849 --> 32:21.548
100% survival rate, indeed.

32:23.289 --> 32:25.769
Not bad, mall cop.

32:25.900 --> 32:27.206
Not bad.

32:30.687 --> 32:34.300
Okay, these should
tide us over for a bit.

32:34.430 --> 32:35.823
- Oh, wow.
- Wow...

32:35.954 --> 32:37.825
Robyn should be
- here any minute.
- Thank you.

32:37.956 --> 32:38.826
Should we try her again?

32:38.957 --> 32:41.133
Hope everything's okay.

32:41.263 --> 32:42.656
Well, she said that
she'd be unreachable

32:42.786 --> 32:44.484
for a bit, and so, uh,

32:44.614 --> 32:46.312
we shouldn't worry.

32:46.442 --> 32:47.922
That's exactly what
we're gonna do.

32:48.053 --> 32:49.706
Okay.

32:54.755 --> 32:57.758
Ah. Excuse me.

32:58.585 --> 33:00.456
Hello?

33:00.587 --> 33:02.981
Hey, Auntie, I'm sorry.
I know I'm running late.

33:03.111 --> 33:04.765
Are you?

33:04.895 --> 33:05.984
We were having
such a good time

33:06.114 --> 33:07.159
we didn't even notice.

33:07.289 --> 33:09.291
Good.

33:09.422 --> 33:10.684
Well, I'll be there soon.

33:10.814 --> 33:11.598
I just have
one quick stop to make.

33:12.729 --> 33:14.993
Hi.

33:15.123 --> 33:17.386
Hi yourself.

33:17.517 --> 33:18.866
Come in.

33:22.652 --> 33:24.741
Nice place.

33:26.526 --> 33:28.615
Sorry I couldn't
get here sooner.

33:28.745 --> 33:30.660
Just one of those days.

33:32.097 --> 33:33.663
So, what's going on?

33:33.794 --> 33:35.535
Your text seemed important.

33:35.665 --> 33:37.450
Uh...

33:37.580 --> 33:41.106
looks like my father
is getting released early.

33:42.498 --> 33:46.067
As you know, we didn't
have the best relationship.

33:46.198 --> 33:49.462
Now he wants a second chance.
He wants to...

33:49.592 --> 33:51.333
meet my kids.

33:51.464 --> 33:53.031
Be a better grandfather to them

33:53.161 --> 33:54.510
than he was a father to me.

33:54.641 --> 33:55.859
How you feel about that?

33:55.990 --> 33:57.861
Not gonna lie.
I don't love the notion.

33:57.992 --> 34:00.690
I came to the conclusion
that there's no sense

34:00.821 --> 34:02.649
in dwelling on the past.

34:02.779 --> 34:04.346
I can't change that.

34:04.477 --> 34:06.261
No, you can't.

34:06.392 --> 34:08.742
But I do have a say
in the future.

34:08.872 --> 34:10.787
My father had plenty
of chances with me.

34:10.918 --> 34:12.006
He blew
every single one of them.

34:12.137 --> 34:13.877
And I'm not gonna set my boys up

34:14.008 --> 34:16.141
for that same disappointment.

34:19.535 --> 34:22.538
Marcus, your father's had
a lot of time to think about

34:22.669 --> 34:24.192
who he's been.

34:24.323 --> 34:26.934
Isn't there any chance
he comes out a better man?

34:27.674 --> 34:29.415
It's possible.

34:29.545 --> 34:32.026
Well, you might want
to find out.

34:32.157 --> 34:34.246
And maybe sooner
rather than later.

34:35.856 --> 34:38.032
'Cause my dad
was my best friend.

34:40.078 --> 34:42.167
And he was there one day,

34:42.297 --> 34:44.082
and the next...

34:47.737 --> 34:50.392
There's nothing I wouldn't give
to have one more day with him.

34:50.523 --> 34:53.221
Sounds like a good man.

34:53.352 --> 34:54.657
A great man.

34:54.788 --> 34:58.226
Not perfect.

35:04.319 --> 35:05.625
I got to go.

35:05.755 --> 35:07.844
To be continued.

35:13.720 --> 35:14.808
Thanks for stopping by.

35:26.559 --> 35:28.604
Your dad must have
gotten something right.

35:30.911 --> 35:33.914
Because he raised you
to be the man you are today.

35:43.619 --> 35:45.230
Okay, so Robyn said,

35:45.360 --> 35:46.753
"Oh, yeah, no, I'm glad.
She's a good cook." I mean,

35:46.883 --> 35:49.408
that's like saying Coltrane
could, like, play the sax. Yeah?

35:49.538 --> 35:51.584
Oh, you flatterer.
Try these.

35:51.714 --> 35:52.802
Oh, yeah?

35:54.500 --> 35:57.242
That crust!

35:57.372 --> 35:58.286
Good God, woman.

35:58.417 --> 35:59.418
We're gonna need another

35:59.548 --> 36:00.593
- bottle of wine.
- Yeah.

36:00.723 --> 36:02.812
What shall we have
next, Harry?

36:02.943 --> 36:04.379
Should it be a burgundy,
pinot noir,

36:04.510 --> 36:07.208
sauvignon, Sancerre?

36:07.339 --> 36:08.383
Oh, Sancerre.

36:08.514 --> 36:09.819
He wants Sancerre,
right, babe?

36:09.950 --> 36:11.908
- Mm.
- Excellent choice, Mel.

36:12.039 --> 36:13.649
Would you help me
- with the glasses?
- Yeah, mm-hmm, of course.

36:13.780 --> 36:14.998
I've never seen him happier
- than this moment.
- No, I...

36:15.129 --> 36:16.304
You know what I mean?

36:18.176 --> 36:19.177
I'm so glad you guys are here.

36:19.307 --> 36:21.135
Yeah, yeah, me, too.
Hey, Dee.

36:21.266 --> 36:22.702
Come here for a second.

36:22.832 --> 36:26.096
Um, so, listen, the thing
you asked me about...

36:26.227 --> 36:28.098
Oh, no, please, just
forget that I asked.

36:28.229 --> 36:31.014
No, I-I thought about it, and

36:31.145 --> 36:33.669
as much as I might
regret it,

36:33.800 --> 36:35.758
I'd regret it more
if I didn't, so...

36:35.889 --> 36:37.151
- You'll train me? Really?
- Yeah.

36:37.282 --> 36:38.021
- Shh. Keep it down.
- Oh, my God, thank you!

36:38.152 --> 36:38.892
Yeah, wait, wait, wait.

36:39.022 --> 36:40.285
I've got two conditions.

36:40.415 --> 36:43.026
The first is you have to do
everything I say

36:43.157 --> 36:45.246
exactly as I say it, okay?

36:45.377 --> 36:47.509
No pushback. We're not friends
while we're doing this.

36:47.640 --> 36:49.772
If we're gonna do this,
we're gonna do it right.

36:49.903 --> 36:51.992
Okay, you won't have to
repeat yourself, I promise.

36:52.122 --> 36:55.169
Okay. Second...

36:55.300 --> 36:57.563
at some point I'm gonna
have to tell your mom,

36:57.693 --> 36:59.129
and when I do,
I'm gonna tell her

36:59.260 --> 37:01.131
it was my idea and you're
gonna go along with it.

37:01.262 --> 37:02.524
Okay?

37:02.655 --> 37:03.569
- Okay.
- Okay.

37:03.699 --> 37:05.788
But why?

37:05.919 --> 37:08.138
Because she's gonna be
pissed as hell, Dee.

37:08.269 --> 37:10.880
And I'm not gonna let this drive
a wedge between the two of you.

37:13.231 --> 37:14.362
So, do we have a deal?

37:16.799 --> 37:18.932
Okay. You can hug me now.

37:19.062 --> 37:20.542
Okay.

37:20.673 --> 37:21.978
Hey, hey.

37:22.109 --> 37:23.023
Hey, what's good?

37:23.153 --> 37:24.981
- She made it.
- Yay!

37:25.112 --> 37:27.245
- What a beautiful home.
- We were about to start...

37:27.375 --> 37:30.248
- Welcome, welcome.
- We about to
start without you.

37:30.378 --> 37:32.467
- Uh-huh, take one.
- Thank you.

37:32.598 --> 37:34.904
- Here you go, my dear.
- Ooh, I am hungry.

37:35.035 --> 37:36.297
This is for you, my love.

37:36.428 --> 37:37.603
First, though, I would like

37:37.733 --> 37:39.909
to make a toast.

37:40.040 --> 37:42.434
To the family
that you have

37:42.564 --> 37:45.263
and the family that you choose.

37:45.393 --> 37:47.221
We're all
here together,

37:47.352 --> 37:48.918
now, and that is because of you,

37:49.049 --> 37:50.398
- so thank you.
- Thank you.

37:50.529 --> 37:52.052
Cheers.

39:44.643 --> 39:47.297
Just so I can talk
and you can not listen.

39:54.348 --> 39:56.089
I miss you, Bishop.

40:03.401 --> 40:05.272
Figured I'd see you again, Fisk.

40:09.363 --> 40:12.584
You are Colton Fisk,

40:12.714 --> 40:14.063
aren't you?

40:16.065 --> 40:18.938
And you're everything
Bishop always said you were.

40:19.068 --> 40:21.680
- When'd you know?
- I had my suspicions.

40:23.159 --> 40:24.073
The way you moved.

40:24.204 --> 40:27.512
The way you handled your weapon.

40:27.642 --> 40:28.948
Reminded me of Bishop.

40:31.211 --> 40:33.953
- He did train you, didn't he?
- He did.

40:34.083 --> 40:37.696
What I don't understand is...

40:39.872 --> 40:42.265
...why the prisoner act?

40:42.396 --> 40:43.963
Just to flush out a mole?

40:44.093 --> 40:46.487
I knew posing a serious
threat to the Brigada

40:46.618 --> 40:49.403
Would force their inside man
to contact them.

40:49.534 --> 40:51.536
Why go through all of that?

40:51.666 --> 40:54.321
Why put all of our lives
in danger?

40:54.452 --> 40:55.931
You could have called
the CIA tac team

40:56.062 --> 40:57.280
anytime you wanted.

40:57.411 --> 40:59.413
How far were you willing
to play this out?

40:59.544 --> 41:01.894
As far as it took
to get answers.

41:02.024 --> 41:03.896
You must've known about Griffin.

41:04.026 --> 41:05.506
It was you who
put him on the team.

41:06.551 --> 41:08.988
But there was someone else
I was worried about.

41:10.685 --> 41:11.556
Me?

41:14.341 --> 41:16.691
- You thought I was a mole?
- You and Griffin

41:16.822 --> 41:18.780
worked closely together
on a number of things.

41:18.911 --> 41:20.347
I needed to find out.

41:20.478 --> 41:21.740
And?

41:23.611 --> 41:25.961
I knew you were clean
when you didn't kill Griffin.

41:26.092 --> 41:29.443
If he would have exposed me,

41:29.574 --> 41:31.619
I would have
had to silence him.

41:31.750 --> 41:33.447
I'm glad you understand.

41:33.578 --> 41:35.449
I understand the logic.

41:35.580 --> 41:37.190
Doesn't mean I agree with it.

41:37.320 --> 41:40.019
You don't have to.

41:40.149 --> 41:42.500
You just have to answer
the phone when I call.

41:42.630 --> 41:44.023
Your arrangement
with the Agency,

41:44.153 --> 41:46.678
the one Bishop negotiated
for you-- it's under

41:46.808 --> 41:48.593
my supervision now.
You work for me.

41:48.723 --> 41:51.900
First of all,
I don't work for anyone.

41:52.031 --> 41:55.904
Especially not someone
as reckless as you.

41:56.035 --> 41:58.777
Your little playacting
got two good agents killed.

41:58.907 --> 42:01.214
Sanford and Shaw
were as guilty as Griffin.

42:01.344 --> 42:03.042
They were as dirty.
Not Brigada moles,

42:03.172 --> 42:05.653
but they'd sold out their
country to other bad actors.

42:05.784 --> 42:09.178
Truth is,
everyone on that team

42:09.309 --> 42:11.137
was guilty of something.

42:11.267 --> 42:12.660
You put my life in danger.

42:13.792 --> 42:15.010
What was I guilty of?

42:15.141 --> 42:17.186
Of getting Bishop killed.

42:17.317 --> 42:19.580
He never should have
been on that plane.

42:19.711 --> 42:22.540
He was supposed to be looking
into something for me that day.

42:22.670 --> 42:24.846
Instead he disregarded
his own safety

42:24.977 --> 42:26.805
in a reckless pursuit
of Mason Quinn,

42:26.935 --> 42:28.546
all because of you

42:28.676 --> 42:31.070
and your selfish obsession.

42:32.462 --> 42:34.290
If not for you, McCall...

42:35.553 --> 42:37.685
Bishop is still alive today.
