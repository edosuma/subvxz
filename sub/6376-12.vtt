WEBVTT

00:01.168 --> 00:04.213
WHAT DO YOU TWO THINK YOU ARE,
A PAIR OF QUEENS?

00:04.213 --> 00:07.841
WELL, I'M KING AROUND HERE,
SO DON'T FORGET IT!

00:07.841 --> 00:09.301
(Hilda and Betty scream)

00:11.637 --> 00:14.223
OH, MY GOSH! I'M SORRY.
ARE YOU GUYS OKAY?

00:14.223 --> 00:15.849
OH!

00:15.849 --> 00:18.352
THAT WAS SO GREAT!

00:18.352 --> 00:21.730
OH, JUSTIN!
YOUR STANLEY IS PERFECT.
OH!

00:21.730 --> 00:23.690
BETTY, I'M NOT SURE.

00:23.690 --> 00:26.360
YOU MAY HAVE
PUT THE "BLAH" IN BLANCHE.

00:26.360 --> 00:29.196
WELL, YOU DIDN'T ACTUALLY
PUT THE "STELLAR" IN STELLA.
OOH, MEAN!

00:29.196 --> 00:33.283
(gasps) YOU ARE SO GETTING INTO
LENA KORVAVINKY'S CLASS!

00:33.283 --> 00:35.035
I CAN FEEL IT.

00:35.035 --> 00:37.704
IT'S LENA <i>KORVINKA.</i>
HOW DO YOU NOT KNOW THAT?

00:37.704 --> 00:42.209
SHE IS ONLY THE MOST FAMOUS
LIVING ACTRESS OF OUR TIME.

00:42.209 --> 00:45.212
I THINK IT IS SO COOL THAT
YOU GET TO AUDITION FOR HER.

00:45.212 --> 00:47.422
HER CLASSES ARE LEGENDARY.
I KNOW!

00:47.422 --> 00:49.049
SHE'S PROBABLY SEEN IT ALL.

00:49.049 --> 00:51.260
I WONDER IF
"A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE"

00:51.260 --> 00:53.845
IS A LITTLE TOO OBVIOUS.

00:53.845 --> 00:57.349
I MAY NEED TO RETHINK THIS.
(sighs)

00:57.349 --> 01:00.352
I'M SO NERVOUS FOR HIM.
I HOPE HE GETS THIS.

01:00.352 --> 01:03.397
I KNOW. HIGH SCHOOL HASN'T
EXACTLY BEEN A PICNIC FOR HIM.

01:03.397 --> 01:06.316
MM.
THAT'S WHY BOBBY AND I
ARE GONNA WAIT

01:06.316 --> 01:09.403
UNTIL THIS WHOLE THING IS OVER
UNTIL WE TELL HIM ABOUT...

01:09.403 --> 01:12.948
(whispers) THE BABY.
(whispers) WAIT. YOU GUYS
ARE GONNA TELL HIM TOGETHER?

01:12.948 --> 01:15.284
(normal voice)
THAT SOUNDS PROMISING.
(normal voice)
I KNOW! (giggles)

01:15.284 --> 01:17.911
OKAY, I'M READY TO GO.
MM.

01:17.911 --> 01:20.581
WAIT. WAIT,
YOU GUYS ARE LEAVING ALREADY?

01:20.581 --> 01:23.250
I THOUGHT THAT MAYBE
YOU COULD STAY, HANG OUT,

01:23.250 --> 01:25.544
AND WE COULD HAVE DINNER
OR SOMETHING.

01:25.544 --> 01:28.213
OH, I'M SORRY.
I MADE DINNER PLANS WITH BOBBY.

01:28.213 --> 01:30.799
YEAH. AND I HAVE TO DECIDE
ON MY COMEDIC MONOLOGUE.

01:30.799 --> 01:32.426
IT'S BETWEEN MOLIèRE

01:32.426 --> 01:34.970
AND ONE OF BRAD'S BREAKDOWNS
FROM "THE RACHEL ZOE PROJECT."

01:34.970 --> 01:37.764
WELL, THAT'S TOO BAD
'CAUSE I MADE TOO MUCH PASTA,

01:37.764 --> 01:40.809
AND I WAS HOPING YOU GUYS WOULD
HELP ME EAT THE LEFTOVERS.

01:40.809 --> 01:43.895
SORRY, A. B.
ALL RIGHT.

01:43.895 --> 01:47.190
WELL, I GUESS I'M JUST USED TO
MAKING ENOUGH FOR ME AND MATT.

01:47.190 --> 01:49.693
AW, YOU WANT ME TO CANCEL?
I'LL CALL BOBBY.

01:49.693 --> 01:52.696
NO, NO. COME ON,
DON'T BE SILLY. GO!

01:52.696 --> 01:55.490
IT'S NOT LIKE
I HAVE NOTHING TO DO.

01:55.490 --> 01:57.284
<i>(man) IT'S GONNA BE</i>
<i>ANOTHER COLD ONE TOMORROW,</i>

01:57.284 --> 01:59.953
<i>SO BUNDLE UP</i>
<i>AND WATCH OUT FOR THE ICE.</i>

01:59.953 --> 02:02.956
<i>IN OTHER NEWS, A WOMAN</i>
<i>IN MIDTOWN WAS FOUND DEAD</i>

02:02.956 --> 02:05.459
<i>IN HER APARTMENT YESTERDAY</i>
<i>AFTER ALMOST A MONTH.</i>
OH!

02:05.459 --> 02:07.794
<i>SOURCES SAY THAT THOUGH</i>
<i>THE WOMAN LIVED IN THE BUILDING</i>

02:07.794 --> 02:10.422
<i>FOR 12 YEARS, NONE OF HER</i>
<i>MORE THAN 50 NEIGHBORS</i>

02:10.422 --> 02:13.342
<i>REALLY KNEW HER</i>
<i>OR NOTICED HER ABSENCE.</i>
AW.

02:13.342 --> 02:15.636
<i>I SAW HER</i>
<i>THROUGH THE WINDOW ONCE,</i>

02:15.636 --> 02:18.263
<i>EATING HER PASTA ALONE.</i>
<i>LOOKED LIKE SHE MADE TOO MUCH.</i>

02:18.263 --> 02:20.849
<i>(man) HOW SAD.</i>

02:20.849 --> 02:23.810
<i>I GUESS THE OLD SAYING</i>
<i>IS TRUE‐‐</i>

02:23.810 --> 02:25.812
<i>YOU REALLY CAN BE ALONE</i>
<i>IN A CROWD.</i>

02:25.812 --> 02:27.189
(Betty gasps)

02:30.484 --> 02:33.070
HEY, GUYS! I WAS JUST THINKING,
WOULDN'T IT BE FUN

02:33.070 --> 02:35.489
IF THE THREE OF US WALKED
TO WORK TOGETHER SOMEDAY?

02:35.489 --> 02:37.491
I MEAN,
SEEING AS WE DO LIVE

02:37.491 --> 02:40.494
ACROSS THE HALL FROM EACH OTHER
AND EVERYTHING.
WE LIVE ACROSS THE HALL
FROM EACH OTHER?

02:40.494 --> 02:43.080
YEAH. WHEN I SAY, "DON'T GO
IN THE HALL. IT'S THERE,"

02:43.080 --> 02:45.082
THAT'S WHAT I MEAN.
(Marc and Amanda laugh)

02:45.082 --> 02:47.042
OKAY, SO WE'RE DOING
THE MEAN THING.

02:47.042 --> 02:49.044
I JUST THINK THAT IT'S WEIRD

02:49.044 --> 02:51.380
THAT I DON'T KNOW ANYONE ELSE
IN THE BUILDING.

02:51.380 --> 02:54.383
I MEAN, DO EITHER ONE OF YOU
EVER TALK TO ANYBODY ELSE?
NOT DIRECTLY,
BUT WE DO LEAVE NASTY NOTES

02:54.383 --> 02:56.802
ON THE BULLETIN BOARD DOWNSTAIRS
FOR SOME OF THEM.
SYNONYMOUSLY, OF COURSE.

02:56.802 --> 02:59.054
SEE, HERE'S THE PROBLEM WITH
LIVING IN AN APARTMENT COMPLEX.

02:59.054 --> 03:01.473
PEOPLE COME HOME, THEY CLOSE
THEIR DOORS, THEY SHUT OUT

03:01.473 --> 03:04.142
THE REST OF THE WORLD,
AND NO ONE TAKES ANY TIME

03:04.142 --> 03:07.062
TO EVEN GET TO KNOW
THEIR NEIGHBORS.
YOU SHOULD REALLY DO SOMETHING
ABOUT THAT, BETTY.

03:07.062 --> 03:10.107
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M GOING TO.
SHE'S A REAL GO‐GETTER,
ISN'T SHE?

03:10.107 --> 03:13.068
IF ONLY SHE'D APPLY SOME
OF THAT PLUCK TO HER CHIN HAIR.

03:13.068 --> 03:14.361
(both laugh)

03:14.361 --> 03:17.197
SEE YOU LATER.
GOOD ONE.

03:17.197 --> 03:18.532
THANK YOU.

03:18.532 --> 03:21.410
OH, AND COULD YOU ALSO MAKE UP
SOME MORE MEDIA KITS

03:21.410 --> 03:23.120
WHEN YOU GET A CHANCE?

03:23.120 --> 03:25.372
I'M GONNA NEED MARC
FOR THE REST OF THE DAY

03:25.372 --> 03:27.791
TO HELP ORGANIZE
THE WILD VEST SHOOT. MARC.

03:27.791 --> 03:31.711
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. WAIT A SECOND.
I CAN'T SPARE MARC TODAY.

03:31.711 --> 03:33.338
DANIEL, I AM WORKING

03:33.338 --> 03:35.507
AS BOTH EDITOR‐IN‐CHIEF
AND CREATIVE DIRECTOR.

03:35.507 --> 03:37.509
UNTIL WE HIRE
A SENIOR FASHION EDITOR,

03:37.509 --> 03:40.512
I HAVE TO HAVE MARC
AVAILABLE TO ME. MARC.

03:40.512 --> 03:43.849
MARC. STAY. LOOK, I'M SORRY
YOU'RE SO OVERWHELMED,

03:43.849 --> 03:46.893
BUT I NEED HIM, TOO.
TO WHAT, SCHEDULE YOUR NAPS?

03:46.893 --> 03:49.271
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'VE HAD
JUST ABOUT ENOUGH OUT OF YOU.

03:49.271 --> 03:51.731
I'VE BEEN MORE THAN KIND
IN SHARING MARC WITH YOU

03:51.731 --> 03:53.733
OVER THE PAST FEW WEEKS,
BUT THAT'S IT.

03:53.733 --> 03:55.735
HE IS OFF‐LIMITS TO YOU.

03:55.735 --> 03:58.780
WHAT? YOU CAN'T CUT ME OFF
FROM MY OWN ASSISTANT.

03:58.780 --> 04:01.241
HE'S NOT YOUR ASSISTANT ANYMORE.
HE'S <i>MINE.</i>

04:01.241 --> 04:05.078
LET ME GET ONE THING THROUGH
THAT GIANT EGG HEAD OF YOURS.

04:05.078 --> 04:08.415
I <i>WILL</i> GET MARC BACK.
THIS IS NOT OVER.

04:16.381 --> 04:17.757
(sighs)

04:21.803 --> 04:23.388
HI! I'M BETTY.

04:23.388 --> 04:25.390
I JUST MOVED BACK
INTO THE BUILDING,

04:25.390 --> 04:28.477
AND I WAS WONDERING
IF MAYBE YOU‐‐
NOT INTERESTED.

04:28.477 --> 04:29.644
OKAY.

04:31.396 --> 04:35.484
HI. WANNA COME TO
A KARAOKE PARTY IN 5‐G?

04:37.027 --> 04:38.820
OH.

04:38.820 --> 04:41.031
"I WILL HUNT YOU DOWN,
'O' MAGAZINE STEALER."

04:41.031 --> 04:44.493
"STOP LETTING YOUR DOG
PEE IN THE HALLWAY, JACKASS."

04:44.493 --> 04:46.661
THAT'S NOT VERY NICE.

04:46.661 --> 04:49.498
(knock on door)

04:49.498 --> 04:51.875
(woman) HEY!
HEY, COULD YOU LET US IN?

04:55.921 --> 04:58.256
THANK YOU SO MUCH!
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

04:58.256 --> 05:00.592
WE WERE ABOUT TO FREEZE
OUT THERE.

05:00.592 --> 05:03.428
YEAH, IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU WERE TURNING BLUE.
OH, YEAH. (chuckles)

05:03.428 --> 05:06.431
DO YOU GUYS
LIVE IN THE BUILDING?
WE'RE MOVING IN TODAY.

05:06.431 --> 05:10.143
YEAH, IN ALL THE CRAZINESS, WE
MANAGED TO LOCK OURSELVES OUT.
OH! THAT'S AWFUL.
OH, I'M BETTY, BY THE WAY.

05:10.143 --> 05:12.938
HI. HEY.
I'M GUS,
AND‐‐AND THAT'S VICKIE.

05:12.938 --> 05:14.981
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I JUST SO HAPPEN TO BE THROWING

05:14.981 --> 05:16.983
A NEIGHBORLY KARAOKE PARTY
IN MY APARTMENT TOMORROW NIGHT.

05:16.983 --> 05:20.320
COME. YOU DON'T HAVE TO SING
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO.
MM.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.322
I MEAN, I WILL, BUT...
MY GOD, HOW NICE! THANK YOU!

05:22.322 --> 05:24.324
YEAH! GREAT!
SEE YOU TOMORROW.
OKAY, BYE.

05:24.324 --> 05:26.493
(Gus) ALL RIGHT, BYE.
OKAY, BYE.

05:26.493 --> 05:27.494
YAY!

05:27.494 --> 05:29.830
I WANNA KILL MYSELF.

05:29.830 --> 05:32.165
WILHELMINA AND DANIEL
WILL NOT STOP FIGHTING OVER ME.

05:32.165 --> 05:34.125
THIS MéNAGE à MOI
HAS GOT TO STOP.

05:34.125 --> 05:36.044
I HATE BEING IN THE MIDDLE.

05:36.044 --> 05:38.046
I MEAN, UNLESS THERE'S
A GYLLENHAAL INVOLVED.

05:38.046 --> 05:40.048
OH, THIS TOTALLY
REMINDS OF ME

05:40.048 --> 05:42.300
OF WHEN I WAS 12
AND MY PARENTS SEPARATED.

05:42.300 --> 05:44.302
I GOT SO GOOD
AT MANIPULATING THEM.

05:44.302 --> 05:48.139
THEY EVEN BOUGHT ME A CHIMP.
I NAMED HIM RAINBOW.
OHH, THAT'S SO CUTE.

05:48.139 --> 05:52.143
BUT THEN I GOT BORED OF HIM
AND LEFT HIM IN A CAB.
NOT AS CUTE.

05:52.143 --> 05:55.188
OH, I JUST CAN'T TAKE
MUCH MORE OF THIS BICKERING.

05:55.188 --> 05:57.566
AWW,
YOU POOR LITTLE GAY‐BEE.

05:57.566 --> 06:00.527
YOU KNOW, AS THE CHILD
OF AN ALMOST‐BROKEN HOME,

06:00.527 --> 06:03.029
I TOTALLY KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.

06:03.029 --> 06:04.364
(gasps)

06:04.364 --> 06:06.616
I JUST GOT
AN AMAZE‐BALLS IDEA.

06:06.616 --> 06:09.202
WHY DON'T YOU LET ME WORK SOME
OF MY MANIPULATIVE MAGIC

06:09.202 --> 06:11.204
ON MOMMY AND DADDY "MODE"?

06:11.204 --> 06:12.247
UH...

06:12.247 --> 06:14.374
ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
GO AHEAD.

06:14.374 --> 06:17.335
BUT I CAN'T HEAR ABOUT ANYTHING
OR BE INVOLVED IN ANY WAY.

06:17.335 --> 06:19.713
BESIDES, I ALREADY HAVE
MY OWN PLAN IN MOTION

06:19.713 --> 06:22.883
FOR HOW TO GET MYSELF
OUT OF THIS MESS.
(whispers) WHAT IS IT?

06:22.883 --> 06:24.259
IT'S TOP SECRET.
(clears throat)

06:24.259 --> 06:26.678
DON'T SCREW UP
WHATEVER YOU'RE GONNA DO, OKAY?

06:30.891 --> 06:34.895
(police radio chatter)

06:34.895 --> 06:37.063
HI.

06:37.063 --> 06:39.900
(man) DO YOU HAVE ANY...
(speaks indistinctly)

06:39.900 --> 06:41.902
EXCUSE ME. WHAT HAPPENED?

06:41.902 --> 06:43.612
OUR BUILDING
GOT BROKEN INTO.

06:43.612 --> 06:45.739
A WHOLE BUNCH OF THE APARTMENTS
WERE ROBBED.

06:45.739 --> 06:48.241
(gasps)
LOOK, THEY EVEN STOLE
OUR PLANTER.

06:48.241 --> 06:51.244
OH, NO!
OH, YEAH. BUT A NEIGHBOR SAW
WHAT WAS HAPPENING,

06:51.244 --> 06:52.996
SO HE CALLED THE POLICE,

06:52.996 --> 06:54.998
AND NOW THEY'RE SCANNING THROUGH
SECURITY FOOTAGE

06:54.998 --> 06:58.209
SO SEE IF THEY CAN FIND
A POSITIVE I. D.
OH, GOOD.

06:58.209 --> 07:00.295
(man) THAT'S THEM!

07:00.295 --> 07:02.881
THEY'RE THE ONES I SAW
RUNNING OFF WITH OUR PLANTER.

07:02.881 --> 07:05.133
HEY, WHO'S THE DINK
LETTING 'EM IN?

07:05.133 --> 07:08.887
(video playing without audio)

07:08.887 --> 07:11.473
(woman) WAIT A MINUTE.

07:11.473 --> 07:14.392
YOU'RE THE DINK!

07:15.935 --> 07:21.983
♪♪♪

07:29.949 --> 07:32.285
I MEAN, HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO
KNOW THAT THEY WERE BURGLARS?

07:32.285 --> 07:34.287
OH, IT'S ALWAYS
THE FRESH‐FACED ONES

07:34.287 --> 07:36.289
THAT GET YA.
ALL I CAN SAY IS,

07:36.289 --> 07:39.125
IT'S A GOOD THING THEY DIDN'T
GET AS HIGH AS OUR FLOOR.
THEY DID.

07:39.125 --> 07:42.087
AMANDA DIDN'T TELL YOU?
THEY STOLE HER SILVER BAG.

07:42.087 --> 07:44.506
YOU MEAN THE SILVER BAG
WITH THE HUGE GOLD SKULL

07:44.506 --> 07:46.508
THAT'S EITHER HIDEOUS
OR BRILLIANT?
YEAH.

07:46.508 --> 07:48.802
I TOLD HER I WOULD
BUY HER A NEW ONE, BUT...

07:48.802 --> 07:52.806
(laughs) HE RUNS SO FUNNY.
I FEEL AWFUL.
I JUST WISH THERE WAS A WAY

07:52.806 --> 07:54.808
I COULD MAKE IT UP
TO THE BUILDING.

07:54.808 --> 07:57.310
ALL OF MY NEIGHBORS
HATE ME NOW.

07:57.310 --> 07:59.312
SOMEONE ACTUALLY
WROTE THE WORD "DIE"

07:59.312 --> 08:01.898
IN HUGE LETTERS ACROSS
THE PARTY INVITATION I POSTED.
OUCH.

08:01.898 --> 08:05.652
<i>YOU</i> DO THE RED‐LINING ON THESE
SINCE <i>YOU</i> HAVE THE ASSISTANT.

08:05.652 --> 08:07.696
(files smack)

08:07.696 --> 08:12.992
WOW.
IT'S BEEN A REAL JOY TO
HAVE HER BACK IN THE OFFICE.

08:12.992 --> 08:16.037
IS THERE ANYTHING
I CAN DO TO HELP?
YEAH, YOU CAN GET ME

08:16.037 --> 08:18.415
ONE OF THOSE ELECTRIC DOG FENCES
FOR THE DOORWAY‐‐

08:18.415 --> 08:20.417
SOMETHING THAT WILL
SHOCK WILHELMINA

08:20.417 --> 08:23.211
EVERY TIME SHE COMES IN.
DANIEL, I DON'T THINK
THAT WOULD EVEN WORK ON HER.

08:23.211 --> 08:25.213
BUT IT MIGHT WORK
IN MY BUILDING.

08:25.213 --> 08:26.381
AFTER CAREFUL THOUGHT,

08:26.381 --> 08:28.800
I'VE DECIDED TO USE THE CLASSIC
"PARENT TRAP" TECHNIQUE

08:28.800 --> 08:30.802
WITH DANIEL AND WILHELMINA.
UH, GREAT. FINE WHATEVER.

08:30.802 --> 08:32.971
LISTEN, REMEMBER YESTERDAY
WHEN YOU BORROWED MY LAPTOP,

08:32.971 --> 08:35.640
AND BEFORE YOU LEFT
YOU PUT IT INTO YOUR SILVER BAG?

08:35.640 --> 08:37.642
THE ONE YOU SAID WAS HIDEOUS?

08:37.642 --> 08:38.810
OR BRILLIANT.

08:38.810 --> 08:41.813
YOU TOOK MY LAPTOP
OUT OF THE BAG

08:41.813 --> 08:43.857
BEFORE IT GOT STOLEN, RIGHT?

08:43.857 --> 08:46.526
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE,
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE,

08:46.526 --> 08:49.446
PLEASE TELL ME THAT YOU DID.
OKAY, I DID.

08:49.446 --> 08:51.698
(laughs)
OH! THANK GOD. WHERE IS IT?

08:51.698 --> 08:54.784
WHAT?
MY LAPTOP.

08:54.784 --> 08:57.412
IS THIS A TRICK QUESTION?

08:57.412 --> 08:59.748
OH, MY GOD! OH, GOD.

08:59.748 --> 09:03.001
THIS IS A DISASTER. MY ENTIRE
LIFE WAS ON THAT COMPUTER.

09:03.001 --> 09:05.003
MARC, I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET,

09:05.003 --> 09:07.338
BUT IT'S NOT LIKE
"HOT GUYS OF THE ISRAELI ARMY"

09:07.338 --> 09:10.341
CAN'T BE DOWNLOADED AGAIN.
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT
"OY, THE BOYS."

09:10.341 --> 09:12.719
THERE'S STUFF ON THAT COMPUTER
THAT IS THE KEY TO MY FUTURE,

09:12.719 --> 09:15.430
AND NOW IT IS GONE...
(inhales deeply) FOREVER.

09:15.430 --> 09:17.432
I'M GOING TO BE SICK.

09:17.432 --> 09:20.351
OKAY, MARC, DON'T WORRY.
I GOT YOU COVERED.

09:20.351 --> 09:22.687
THIS WILHELMINA AND DANIEL THING
IS IN THE BAG.

09:22.687 --> 09:23.938
(inhales deeply)

09:23.938 --> 09:26.441
(scoffs)
I'M SORRY. I...

09:29.069 --> 09:31.279
<i>AY,</i> JUSTIN!

09:31.279 --> 09:34.616
I WANNA BE SUPPORTIVE,
BUT THE PACING HAS TO STOP.

09:34.616 --> 09:36.951
OKAY, I'LL JUST GO UPSTAIRS.

09:36.951 --> 09:39.287
HEY, I GOT US
SOME SCARY MOVIES.

09:39.287 --> 09:42.082
THE LADY AT THE RENTAL PLACE
SAID THEY WERE "CAMPY FUN."

09:42.082 --> 09:45.460
I CAN'T, GRANDPA. NO ONE LIKES
CAMPY FUN AS MUCH AS I DO,

09:45.460 --> 09:48.630
BUT I'M A LITTLE WOUND UP
RIGHT NOW. (sighs)

09:48.630 --> 09:50.465
MAYBE I'LL FEEL BETTER

09:50.465 --> 09:52.717
AFTER MY RUN‐THROUGH
AT THE AUDITION SPACE TONIGHT.

09:52.717 --> 09:55.220
NEED A RIDE?
I COULD TAKE YOU.

09:55.220 --> 09:57.764
BOBBY AND I
ALREADY GOT IT COVERED.

09:57.764 --> 09:59.974
FINE.

10:02.393 --> 10:05.522
OKAY, THIS HAS TO STOP.

10:05.522 --> 10:08.817
(sighs)
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
YOU. THIS.

10:08.817 --> 10:12.195
THE WAY YOU ACT EVERY TIME
BOBBY'S NAME COMES UP.

10:12.195 --> 10:14.197
COME ON, I THOUGHT MAYBE
YOU COULD COME WITH ME

10:14.197 --> 10:16.658
TO THE DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT
ON THURSDAY...
(water running)

10:16.658 --> 10:18.493
SEE YOUR NEW GRANDKID.

10:18.493 --> 10:20.662
(turns off water)
IS HE GONNA BE THERE?

10:20.662 --> 10:22.997
IF BY "HE" YOU MEAN BOBBY‐‐

10:22.997 --> 10:26.417
YEAH, THE FATHER OF MY CHILD
IS GONNA BE THERE.

10:26.417 --> 10:28.837
HE WANTS TO BE THERE
EVERY STEP OF THE WAY.

10:28.837 --> 10:31.422
(sighs) YOU'RE DECEIVING
YOURSELF, <i>MIJA.</i>

10:31.422 --> 10:34.425
CAN'T YOU SEE THAT
THIS BOBBY CHARACTER

10:34.425 --> 10:36.511
IS NOT RELIABLE?
YOU'RE WRONG.

10:36.511 --> 10:39.264
BOBBY AND I
ARE GONNA BE A FAMILY.

10:39.264 --> 10:42.142
SO... YOU BETTER
GET USED TO IT.

10:46.312 --> 10:48.815
THANK YOU, EVERYONE,
FOR COMING.

10:48.815 --> 10:51.025
NOT AS BIG A TURNOUT
AS I HOPED.

10:51.025 --> 10:54.154
BUT ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR
OF US‐‐THAT'S NOT BAD, RIGHT?

10:54.154 --> 10:57.490
OH, DON'T COUNT ME.
I'M JUST GETTIN' MY MAIL.

10:57.490 --> 11:00.076
OKAY.

11:00.076 --> 11:03.663
SO... AFTER YESTERDAY'S
UNFORTUNATE INCIDENT,

11:03.663 --> 11:06.166
WHICH I FEEL
PARTIALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR‐‐

11:06.166 --> 11:08.209
PARTIALLY?
IT WAS YOUR FAULT.

11:08.209 --> 11:10.962
OKAY, I MEAN, I DIDN'T
ROB THE BUILDING MYSELF.

11:10.962 --> 11:13.631
I MADE AN INNOCENT MISTAKE.

11:13.631 --> 11:17.468
ANYWAY, I SPOKE
TO OUR LANDLORD‐‐MR. Z.‐‐

11:17.468 --> 11:19.470
AND ARRANGED FOR HIM TO INSTALL

11:19.470 --> 11:22.140
AN ELECTRONIC LOCKING DEVICE
ON OUR DOORS.

11:22.140 --> 11:23.641
TA‐DA!

11:23.641 --> 11:25.476
SEE?

11:25.476 --> 11:29.689
NOW NONE OF US WILL EVER HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT "LOST KEYS" AGAIN

11:29.689 --> 11:32.692
BECAUSE WE'LL HAVE THE OPTION
OF USING A PASS CODE,

11:32.692 --> 11:35.737
WHICH I WILL NOW CHOOSE BASED ON
YOUR THOUGHTFUL SUGGESTIONS.

11:35.737 --> 11:39.115
THE NEW BUILDING PASS CODE

11:39.115 --> 11:41.576
IS... "FART."

11:43.119 --> 11:44.913
OKAY.

11:44.913 --> 11:47.540
(laughs) I GUESS
I'LL JUST PICK ANOTHER ONE.

11:47.540 --> 11:50.084
(man) WHY?
(woman) WHAT'S WRONG
WITH "FART"?

11:50.084 --> 11:51.669
FIRST YOU GET US ROBBED

11:51.669 --> 11:55.340
AND NOW YOU WON'T EVEN
TAKE OUR SUGGESTIONS?

11:55.340 --> 11:56.507
FINE.

11:56.507 --> 11:58.593
THE BUILDING HAS SPOKEN.

11:58.593 --> 12:00.762
I WILL HAVE MR. Z.
NOTIFY EVERYONE

12:00.762 --> 12:05.016
THAT THE NEW BUILDING PASS CODE
IS "FART."

12:05.016 --> 12:06.517
OKAY, NOW...

12:06.517 --> 12:08.728
FOR THE CUTTING
OF THE RIBBON.

12:08.728 --> 12:09.896
MARC!

12:09.896 --> 12:11.981
YOU JUST RUINED MY RIBBON!

12:11.981 --> 12:15.568
YEAH? WELL, YOU RUINED MY LIFE,
SO... I GUESS WE'RE EVEN.

12:15.568 --> 12:17.779
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

12:17.779 --> 12:19.948
MY LAPTOP
WAS IN AMANDA'S SILVER BAG.

12:19.948 --> 12:20.990
(inhales sharply)

12:20.990 --> 12:22.742
OH, I'M SORRY.

12:22.742 --> 12:25.495
I CAN CALL H. R.
MAYBE INSURANCE WILL COVER IT.

12:25.495 --> 12:28.164
REALLY? OH, WILL THEY ALSO COVER
MY LOST SUBMISSION MATERIAL

12:28.164 --> 12:30.166
FOR THE NEW
SENIOR FASHION EDITOR'S JOB?

12:30.166 --> 12:31.542
HUH?! WILL THEY?!

12:31.542 --> 12:33.586
WOW. YOU WERE
APPLYING FOR THAT?

12:33.586 --> 12:35.588
THAT'S... AMBITIOUS.

12:35.588 --> 12:37.215
YEAH, BETTY. NEWSFLASH‐‐

12:37.215 --> 12:40.134
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE
WITH HOPES AND DREAMS.

12:43.763 --> 12:46.891
SO, UH, MARC WENT HOME SICK,
HUH?

12:46.891 --> 12:49.727
MM‐HMM.
'CAUSE HE HAS LOOKED
PRETTY TIRED LATELY.

12:49.727 --> 12:52.814
TOTALLY. SO IT LOOKS LIKE
ALL YOU HAVE LEFT

12:52.814 --> 12:55.692
IS YOUR 6:15 IN THE LOUNGE.
OH, GREAT.

12:55.692 --> 12:57.694
(gasps)
OOPS. STRIKE THAT.

12:57.694 --> 13:01.656
FORGET I EVER SAID ANYTHING
OR SHE'LL KILL ME.

13:01.656 --> 13:03.825
WHAT? WHO WILL KILL YOU?
WILHELMINA.

13:03.825 --> 13:06.202
I WASN'T SUPPOSED TO TELL YOU
ABOUT THAT MEETING.

13:06.202 --> 13:08.538
SHE SAID SOMETHING ABOUT
WANTING TO TAKE IT ALONE.

13:08.538 --> 13:10.456
SHE DID, DID SHE?
YEAH.

13:12.458 --> 13:14.836
WELL, I GUESS SHE'S IN FOR
A VERY BIG SURPRISE.

13:14.836 --> 13:15.962
(gasps)

13:15.962 --> 13:17.588
MARC WENT HOME SICK?

13:17.588 --> 13:20.591
HE'D NEVER HAVE THE NERVE
TO DO THAT ON MY WATCH.

13:22.093 --> 13:24.470
WHY ARE YOU STILL HERE?

13:24.470 --> 13:27.432
(gasps) OH! UH, MARC LEFT
YOUR SCHEDULE WITH ME.

13:27.432 --> 13:29.767
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT WANNA
GO OVER IT.

13:29.767 --> 13:31.519
NO.
NO?

13:31.519 --> 13:34.647
UM, BECAUSE YOU DO HAVE
AN APPOINTMENT‐‐

13:34.647 --> 13:36.482
GO.

13:36.482 --> 13:38.818
BUT, UH, DON'T YOU WANT ME
TO TELL YOU ABOUT

13:38.818 --> 13:41.237
THE 6:15 MEETING THAT DAD‐‐
I MEAN, DANIEL IS RUNNING?

13:41.237 --> 13:43.322
DID YOU JUST REFER TO DANIEL
AS "DAD"?

13:43.322 --> 13:45.241
NO, MOM.
(gasps) I MEAN, WILHEL‐MOMMY.

13:45.241 --> 13:47.493
I MEAN,
DANIEL SET UP A MEETING

13:47.493 --> 13:50.496
THAT HE DOESN'T WANT YOU
TO KNOW ABOUT IN THE LOUNGE.

13:50.496 --> 13:53.207
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND
OF KINKY RELATIONSHIP

13:53.207 --> 13:54.834
YOU AND DANIEL HAVE,

13:54.834 --> 13:57.795
BUT "DADDY" IS NOT KEEPING ME
FROM ANY MEETING.

13:59.338 --> 14:00.840
(gasps)

14:00.840 --> 14:03.801
I AM SO GETTING
ANOTHER CHIMP OUT OF THIS.

14:03.801 --> 14:06.137
(ringing doorbell)
COME ON, MARC!

14:06.137 --> 14:09.640
(singsongy) I'M NOT GONNA LEAVE
TILL YOU OPEN THE DOOR!

14:09.640 --> 14:10.725
UGH!

14:10.725 --> 14:12.351
TALK FAST.

14:12.351 --> 14:15.354
I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF
ANGER EATING A 7‐CHEESE LASAGNA.

14:15.354 --> 14:17.065
I JUST WANT TO APOLOGIZE.

14:17.065 --> 14:18.691
I THINK IT'S GREAT

14:18.691 --> 14:21.360
THAT YOU'RE APPLYING
FOR THE SENIOR EDITOR POSITION.

14:21.360 --> 14:24.405
SO YOU DON'T THINK
IT'S OUT OF MY LEAGUE?

14:24.405 --> 14:29.077
I THINK IT'S A BIG STEP UP,
BUT YOU'RE PERFECT FOR IT.

14:29.077 --> 14:31.579
OF COURSE I AM.
BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER.

14:31.579 --> 14:33.581
WILHELMINA'S GONNA
MAKE A DECISION BY TOMORROW.

14:33.581 --> 14:35.583
SO ALL OF
THE SUBMISSION MATERIALS

14:35.583 --> 14:37.919
HAVE TO BE ON HER DESK
BY TONIGHT.

14:37.919 --> 14:40.922
AND THERE IS NO WAY THAT I CAN
RECREATE EVERYTHING THAT I DID

14:40.922 --> 14:42.381
BY MYSELF BY MIDNIGHT.

14:42.381 --> 14:44.842
WHAT‐‐WHAT‐‐WHAT IF
I HELPED YOU?
(scoffs) FORGET IT, BETTY.

14:44.842 --> 14:46.427
YEAH, LET ME DO THIS.

14:46.427 --> 14:48.429
PLEASE.
I WOULD FEEL SO AWFUL

14:48.429 --> 14:51.182
IF YOU MISSED THIS OPPORTUNITY
BECAUSE OF ME.

14:53.017 --> 14:55.228
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE?

14:55.228 --> 14:57.313
PFFT. UGH. WELL...

14:57.313 --> 14:59.565
CAN I HAVE
A PIECE OF LASAGNA?
NO.

15:01.567 --> 15:04.570
I SHOULD'VE KNOWN YOU'D TRY
AND PULL A STUNT LIKE THIS.

15:04.570 --> 15:06.572
WELL, I'M NOT THE ONE
BOOKING SECRET MEETINGS

15:06.572 --> 15:10.284
AND TRYING TO
GET AWAY WITH IT, AM I?
YES, YOU ARE.
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

15:10.284 --> 15:12.286
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

15:12.286 --> 15:15.248
(clears throat)

15:15.248 --> 15:17.125
WAIT.

15:17.125 --> 15:20.878
IF NEITHER OF US BOOKED
THIS MEETING, WHO IS THIS?

15:20.878 --> 15:22.880
I'M YOUR COUPLES COUNSELOR.

15:22.880 --> 15:27.135
AND BY THE LOOKS OF IT,
I HAVE MY WORK CUT OUT FOR ME.

15:33.766 --> 15:35.893
COUPLES COUNSELOR?
IS THIS SOME KIND OF JOKE?

15:35.893 --> 15:37.728
WHO WOULD DO THIS?

15:37.728 --> 15:39.772
OH, AS IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW,
DADDY‐O.

15:39.772 --> 15:42.150
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
I'M LEAVING.

15:42.150 --> 15:44.777
WELL, I'VE CLEARLY IDENTIFIED
THE BETA DOG

15:44.777 --> 15:47.989
IN THIS RELATIONSHIP.
I HOPE FOR YOUR SAKE

15:47.989 --> 15:50.491
YOU DIDN'T JUST USE
THE WORDS "DOG" OR "BETA"

15:50.491 --> 15:52.493
IN RELATION TO ME.

15:52.493 --> 15:56.831
SORRY. I WAS MERELY REFERENCING
A COMMON BEHAVIORAL PATTERN.

15:56.831 --> 15:59.292
THE FIRST PERSON TO LEAVE A ROOM
TENDS TO BE THE WEAKER ONE.

15:59.292 --> 16:01.169
HUH.

16:01.169 --> 16:02.962
IS THAT SO?

16:13.764 --> 16:14.932
YES!
UGH!

16:14.932 --> 16:17.602
I FOUND MY FANCY PAPER.
"MATT‐LESS IN MANHATTAN"?

16:17.602 --> 16:19.604
YOU'RE NOT SERIOUSLY THINKING
OF USING THAT

16:19.604 --> 16:21.647
AS A TITLE FOR SOMETHING,
ARE YOU?

16:21.647 --> 16:23.900
IT'S FOR MY BLOG. I FORGOT
IT WAS UP ON THE SCREEN.

16:23.900 --> 16:27.153
HOW DO YOU WANT TO DO THIS?
YOU WANNA DICTATE WHILE I TYPE?

16:27.153 --> 16:30.323
I DON'T KNOW. I HAD ALL THESE
MOCK‐UPS AND CUSTOMIZED LAYOUTS.

16:30.323 --> 16:32.325
AND IT TOOK ME WEEKS
TO MAKE ALL THE DECISIONS.

16:32.325 --> 16:35.828
THIS IS NEVER GONNA BE
AS GOOD.
YES, IT WILL BE, MARC.
YOU'RE GREAT.

16:35.828 --> 16:37.830
I HAVE TO BE MORE THAN GREAT.

16:37.830 --> 16:41.834
THIS IS A SENIOR POSITION.
I HAVE TO WOW THEM.
(knock on door)

16:41.834 --> 16:44.378
OKAY, WELL,
THEN WE'LL WOW THEM.

16:44.378 --> 16:48.132
WE'VE GOT ALL NIGHT, AND NEITHER
OF US HAVE ANYTHING ELSE TO DO.

16:48.132 --> 16:50.801
(groans)

16:52.470 --> 16:54.722
HI. WE'RE HERE
FOR YOUR PARTY.

16:54.722 --> 16:57.058
OH. UM...

16:57.058 --> 16:59.477
(lowers voice) I ASSUMED
NO ONE WAS COMING

16:59.477 --> 17:00.811
AFTER
THE WHOLE BURGLARY THING.

17:00.811 --> 17:03.189
WHAT?
SO YOU DON'T WANT US HERE?

17:03.189 --> 17:04.690
NO, I‐‐YES, I‐I DO.

17:04.690 --> 17:06.734
I D‐‐I DID. IT'S JUST...

17:06.734 --> 17:08.736
THIS LAST‐MINUTE PROJECT THING
SORT OF CAME UP,

17:08.736 --> 17:10.738
AND I'M A LITTLE‐‐
WHAT'S GOING ON?

17:10.738 --> 17:13.866
SHE'S CANCELING ON US.
WHAT? NOW?

17:13.866 --> 17:16.077
AFTER EVERYTHING SHE'S PUT US
THROUGH? SHE <i>OWES</i> US.
OH, YEAH.

17:16.077 --> 17:18.079
(woman) MM‐HMM.
SEE, THIS IS WHY

17:18.079 --> 17:20.623
YOU SHOULD NEVER
GET TO KNOW YOUR NEIGHBORS.
(indistinct conversations)

17:20.623 --> 17:24.585
AND EVEN THOUGH I SPENT YEARS
WORKING MY WAY TO THE TOP

17:24.585 --> 17:26.671
WHILE DANIEL HERE
HAD THE SAME JOB

17:26.671 --> 17:29.549
HANDED TO HIM ON
A SILVER PLATTER BY HIS FATHER,

17:29.549 --> 17:33.553
I'VE ALWAYS TREATED HIM
WITH RESPECT.
OH, THAT IS SUCH BULL.

17:33.553 --> 17:35.555
YOU'VE ALWAYS
BEEN A BITCH TO ME,

17:35.555 --> 17:37.890
ONLY NOW SHE'S BEING
A SUPER BITCH. IT'S UNBELIEV‐‐

17:37.890 --> 17:39.850
YOU SEE WHAT I HAVE
TO DEAL WITH?

17:39.850 --> 17:41.852
(voice breaks)
IT'S THE NAME‐CALLING

17:41.852 --> 17:45.231
THAT HURTS THE MOST.
OKAY, TIME‐OUT.

17:45.231 --> 17:48.067
SHE IS TOTALLY FAKING RIGHT NOW.
THIS IS NOT HER.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.278
AND P. S., SHE CALLS ME NAMES
ALL THE TIME.

17:50.278 --> 17:52.280
THIS MORNING,
SHE CALLED ME AN EGG HEAD.

17:52.280 --> 17:55.074
(normal voice) I WAS MERELY
MAKING AN OBSERVATION.

17:55.074 --> 17:58.744
CAN I HELP IT IF YOUR HEAD HAS
A WEIRD ELLIPTICAL ARC TO IT?

17:58.744 --> 18:00.746
DO YOU SEE THIS?
SHE'S INSULTING ME,

18:00.746 --> 18:04.917
ALL BECAUSE I WOULDN'T
LET HER GET WAY WITH MARC.
AS IF YOU COULD EVER KEEP ME
FROM HAVING MY WAY!

18:04.917 --> 18:08.087
OH, GET OVER YOURSELF ALREADY!
COME ON.
(exhales deeply)

18:09.797 --> 18:12.466
I GUESS WE'RE DONE HERE.

18:12.466 --> 18:14.885
I'M SORRY
TO HAVE WASTED YOUR TIME.

18:14.885 --> 18:18.222
ON THE CONTRARY. THIS HAS BEEN
VERY ENLIGHTENING.

18:18.222 --> 18:21.767
AND I THINK I <i>MAY</i> HAVE
PINPOINTED

18:21.767 --> 18:24.145
THE SOURCE OF YOUR ISSUE.

18:24.145 --> 18:25.605
(folder thuds)

18:25.605 --> 18:28.774
SEXUAL TENSION.

18:28.774 --> 18:30.943
UH... LOOK, I'M SORRY.

18:30.943 --> 18:34.363
WILHELMINA IS THE LAST PERSON
I WOULD EVER BE INTERESTED IN.

18:34.363 --> 18:37.450
(chuckles) WELL,
HER BODY LANGUAGE WOULD SUGGEST

18:37.450 --> 18:40.870
THAT SHE JUST MIGHT
BE INTERESTED IN YOU.

18:40.870 --> 18:43.456
WAIT. HER WHAT
SEEMED TO SUGGEST...

18:43.456 --> 18:46.042
PLEASE HAVE A SEAT.

18:46.042 --> 18:49.754
THERE ARE MANY
NONVERBAL SIGNALS

18:49.754 --> 18:51.339
TO INDICATE DESIRE.

18:51.339 --> 18:53.924
FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN SOMEONE
STEPS INTO YOUR SPACE

18:53.924 --> 18:55.926
AND REFUSES TO RELINQUISH IT,

18:55.926 --> 18:59.639
OR IF THERE IS MIRRORING
OF SPEECH OR MOVEMENT.

18:59.639 --> 19:01.474
IN THE ANIMAL KINGDOM,

19:01.474 --> 19:04.935
IT CAN BE AS SIMPLE AS A FEMALE
PRESENTING HER BACKSIDE.

19:04.935 --> 19:07.897
MY ADVICE‐‐IF YOU WANT TO STOP
THE HOSTILITY,

19:07.897 --> 19:12.818

IF WE PUT OUR MINDS TOGETHER,

25:39.371 --> 25:42.374

COME UP WITH A SOLUTION.

JUST SIT TIGHT, HUH?

26:40.265 --> 26:41.558

27:24.101 --> 27:26.645
WE BOTH KNOW THE REASON
YOU'RE SO HOSTILE WITH ME

27:26.645 --> 27:28.689
IS THAT
YOU SECRETLY WANT ME.

THAT'S OUT ON THE TABLE,

27:31.358 --> 27:35.153

CAN I PUT MY HEAD DOWN YET?

27:47.666 --> 27:51.003
NO. I TOLD YOU,
YOU HAVE TO WAIT TEN MINUTES.

27:51.003 --> 27:52.212
THE WAY YOU'RE ACTING,

27:52.212 --> 27:54.464
YOU'D THINK THAT
I WAS THE ONE THAT ATTACKED YOU.

27:54.464 --> 27:56.466
YEAH? I HAD EVERY RIGHT
TO ATTACK YOU.

27:56.466 --> 27:59.553
I WAS PROTECTING MY HOME
FROM AN INTRUDER.
INTRUDER? COME ON.
I WASN'T INTRUDING.

27:59.553 --> 28:01.638
I WAS COMING
TO CHECK ON JUSTIN AND HILDA,

28:01.638 --> 28:05.225
MAKE SURE THEY WERE ALL RIGHT
DURING THE BLACKOUT.
OH, YEAH?

28:05.225 --> 28:07.811
AND WHY WEREN'T YOU WITH THEM?
HILDA SAID YOU WERE

28:07.811 --> 28:11.064
GOING TOGETHER TO TAKE JUSTIN
FOR HIS WALK‐THROUGH.
I GOT STUCK AT WORK.

28:11.064 --> 28:14.693
OH. I DIDN'T KNOW BEING A THUG
REQUIRED SUCH DEDICATED HOURS.

28:14.693 --> 28:17.029
HEY, COME ON, MAN.
IT'S SO HARD TO BELIEVE

28:17.029 --> 28:20.449
THAT I'M NOT THE SAME PERSON
I WAS AT 17?

28:20.449 --> 28:23.702
I LOVE YOUR DAUGHTER.

28:23.702 --> 28:26.455
I PLAN ON BEING AROUND
FOR HER AND THE NEW BABY

28:26.455 --> 28:27.748
AND JUSTIN, TOO.

28:27.748 --> 28:29.750
PLEASE.

28:29.750 --> 28:32.336
YOU MAY HAVE
MY DAUGHTER AND GRANDSON FOOLED

28:32.336 --> 28:34.713

GOOD‐GUY ROUTINE,

28:34.713 --> 28:36.715
BUT YOU'RE NOT FOOLING ME.

28:36.715 --> 28:40.177
NOT FOR NOTHING, YOU KNOW
WHAT I THINK, MR. SUAREZ?

28:40.177 --> 28:43.889
I THINK THAT YOU'RE SECRETLY
WORRIED THAT I AM A GOOD GUY,

28:43.889 --> 28:46.016
BECAUSE IF THAT'S THE CASE,

28:46.016 --> 28:48.185
THEN THEY WON'T DEPEND
ON ONLY YOU ANYMORE,

28:48.185 --> 28:49.770
AND YOU CAN'T HANDLE THAT.

28:51.897 --> 28:55.150
EXCUSE ME. I'M GONNA GO WAIT
IN THE OTHER ROOM.

29:02.824 --> 29:04.242
(sighs)

29:04.242 --> 29:06.912
HERE.
YOU HAVE SOME BLOOD.

29:08.789 --> 29:10.791
I'D OFFER
TO DAB IT FOR YOU,

29:10.791 --> 29:13.126
BUT I'M AFRAID
YOU'D START LICKING MY FINGERS.

29:13.126 --> 29:15.712
OKAY, YOU MADE YOUR POINT.

29:15.712 --> 29:17.714
I MISREAD THE SIGNS.

29:17.714 --> 29:19.716
BUT IF IT'S NOT
SEXUAL TENSION,

29:19.716 --> 29:23.261
THEN WHY THE HELL HAVE YOU BEEN
SO MEAN TO ME LATELY?

29:23.261 --> 29:25.639
IT CAN'T JUST BE
ABOUT MARC.
ACTUALLY, IT IS.

29:25.639 --> 29:28.266
AS HARD AS IT IS
FOR ME TO ADMIT,

29:28.266 --> 29:31.103
MARC IS THE MOST IMPORTANT MAN
IN MY LIFE.

29:31.103 --> 29:33.438
OH, COME ON. IS THAT
THE SAME LOAD OF CRAP

29:33.438 --> 29:36.441
YOU WERE TRYING TO SELL
THE COUPLES' COUNSELOR?
(sighs) LOOK.

29:36.441 --> 29:39.444
I KNOW MARC MIGHT NOT WALK
LIKE A MAN OR TALK LIKE A MAN

29:39.444 --> 29:41.780
AND HIS FEATURES
ARE VAGUELY LESBIAN,

29:41.780 --> 29:46.284
BUT THE TRUTH IS, HE'S BEEN
MY ONE CONSTANT OVER THE YEARS.

29:46.284 --> 29:48.537
IF I WERE ON MY DEATHBED,

29:48.537 --> 29:50.539
HE'D BE THE PERSON I'D CALL.

29:53.625 --> 29:55.585
CLEARLY,
WE CAN'T KEEP PULLING MARC

29:55.585 --> 29:57.587
BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN US.

29:57.587 --> 29:59.589
IT'S NOT FAIR TO US OR HIM.

29:59.589 --> 30:01.925
WE HAVE
TO FIGURE SOMETHING OUT.

30:01.925 --> 30:04.469
(sighs) FINE.

30:04.469 --> 30:07.347
I'LL DO ANYTHING AS LONG
AS YOU DON'T TOUCH ME AGAIN.

30:09.307 --> 30:10.684
SO, MARC...

30:10.684 --> 30:13.311
I TOOK ANOTHER LOOK
AT THE FIRE ESCAPE,

30:13.311 --> 30:15.731
AND IT REALLY DOESN'T LOOK
SO BAD.

30:15.731 --> 30:18.358
I HAVE A TON OF SALT
IN MY APARTMENT.

30:18.358 --> 30:21.570
(Marc) AND IN YOUR DIET.

30:21.570 --> 30:24.573
LOOK, I UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU'RE ANGRY,

30:24.573 --> 30:26.575
BUT I THINK
IT WOULD BE HELPFUL

30:26.575 --> 30:28.994
IF WE JUST TRIED TO BE
<i>IN</i> THE SOLUTION.

30:28.994 --> 30:30.537
(cell phone rings)

30:30.537 --> 30:32.164
(beeps)

30:32.164 --> 30:34.750
DAD?
<i>MIJA,</i>
THANK GOD YOU ANSWERED.

30:34.750 --> 30:37.961
I JUST GOT A TEXT FROM YOUR
SISTER. SHE AND JUSTIN ARE FINE.

30:37.961 --> 30:40.964
How are you?
I'M FINE. IT'S JUST,
WE HAVE TO GET OUT

30:40.964 --> 30:43.508
OF THE BUILDING, AND THE STUPID
ELECTRIC DOOR WON'T OPEN.

30:43.508 --> 30:46.053
SWEETIE,
WH‐WH‐WH‐WHAT CAN I DO?
Nothing.

30:46.053 --> 30:48.555
UNLESS YOU KNOW SOMEONE
WHO CAN PICK A LOCK.

30:48.555 --> 30:50.724
OKAY, CHIPMUNK... (chuckles)

30:50.724 --> 30:54.061
You got a‐a‐a red wire,
a yellow wire and a green wire.

30:54.061 --> 30:56.563
ALL RIGHT,
MOVE 'EM ALL TO THE LEFT.
Okay.

30:56.563 --> 30:59.941
I'M GONNA TRY AND BE REALLY
CAREFUL AND NOT LET THEM TOUCH,

30:59.941 --> 31:01.568
BUT MY HANDS ARE
A LITTLE SHAKY, THOUGH.

31:01.568 --> 31:04.696
SWEETIE, THIS ISN'T
"MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE," OKAY?

31:04.696 --> 31:06.364
THERE'S NO ELECTRICITY.

31:06.364 --> 31:09.409
(whispers) RIGHT.
I just want you to be able
to see the cylinder.

31:09.409 --> 31:11.411
(tools clicking)
I SEE IT!

31:11.411 --> 31:14.539
Good. Now go ahead and stick
the screwdriver in the cylinder

31:14.539 --> 31:16.249
AND TURN IT CLOCKWISE

31:16.249 --> 31:17.876
till you hear
a little click.
(click)

31:17.876 --> 31:19.503
(gasps)
OH! (chuckles)

31:19.503 --> 31:21.671
All right. Now you're
gonna go counterclockwise

31:21.671 --> 31:23.423
UNTIL THE DEAD BOLT
SLIDES OPEN.

31:23.423 --> 31:24.841
(clicking)
AAH!

31:24.841 --> 31:26.551
THAT'S IT.
IT WORKED! IT WORKS!

31:26.551 --> 31:27.886
OF COURSE IT DID.

31:27.886 --> 31:30.847
WHAT DO YOU THINK,
I'M AN AMATEUR?

31:30.847 --> 31:33.558
I'M NOT A PROFESSIONAL,
NEITHER.
MM‐HMM.

31:33.558 --> 31:36.686
OH, BOBBY, I OWE YOU SO BIG.
WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE COLOGNE?

31:36.686 --> 31:39.564
(door closes)
BECAUSE SOMETIMES AT WORK WE GET
FREE SAMP‐‐I GOTTA GO! MARC!

31:42.234 --> 31:44.236
I GOTTA SAY,
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE

31:44.236 --> 31:46.822
THAT YOU BROKE US OUT
OF OUR OWN APARTMENT BUILDING.

31:46.822 --> 31:48.657
IT WAS BOLD, SUAREZ,

31:48.657 --> 31:51.076
EVEN FOR SOMEONE WHO SOMETIMES
WEARS SOCKS WITH HEELS.

31:51.076 --> 31:53.662
I JUST HOPE THE NEIGHBORS
AREN'T TOO MAD AT ME.

31:53.662 --> 31:56.665
I REALLY FELT LIKE I WAS MAKING
PROGRESS WITH THEM TONIGHT,

31:56.665 --> 31:59.626
UNTIL THEY ALL LEFT
TO GO TO AMANDA'S PARTY.
WHY DO YOU CARE
WHAT THEY THINK?

31:59.626 --> 32:01.044
I DON'T KNOW.

32:01.044 --> 32:04.047
I WAS JUST TRYING TO MAKE
CONNECTIONS WITH PEOPLE.

32:04.047 --> 32:06.633
I'VE HAD A REALLY HARD YEAR,
YOU KNOW?

32:06.633 --> 32:08.969
MY BEST FRIEND
LEFT TO SCOTLAND, MATT LEFT,

32:08.969 --> 32:11.596
AND I MOVED AWAY
FROM MY FAMILY.

32:11.596 --> 32:13.598
SOMETIMES,
I FEEL LIKE I GET HOME

32:13.598 --> 32:15.767
AND I COULD
CLOSE THE DOOR AND DIE,

32:15.767 --> 32:18.770
AND NO ONE WOULD KNOW UNTIL
THEY SMELLED MY ROTTING CORPSE.
(siren wailing in distance)

32:18.770 --> 32:20.272
UGH.

32:20.272 --> 32:22.274
I GUESS
YOU NEVER FEEL LONELY, HUH?

32:22.274 --> 32:24.609
NO. MY LIFE IS
WAY TOO FABULOUS.

32:24.609 --> 32:26.611
(gasps)

32:26.611 --> 32:28.697
IS THAT MEADE?

32:28.697 --> 32:30.782
IT LOOKS SO WEIRD ALL DARK.

32:30.782 --> 32:32.617
(whispers) OH, MY GOD.

32:32.617 --> 32:34.786
(normal voice)
HOW COULD WE BE SO STUPID?

32:34.786 --> 32:36.621
MEADE IS, LIKE,
ELECTRIC EVERYTHING!

32:36.621 --> 32:39.624
WE'RE NEVER GONNA BE ABLE
TO GET IN.

32:39.624 --> 32:42.961
ONCE AGAIN, LIFE HAS POOPED
ON THE HEAD OF MARC ST. JAMES.

32:42.961 --> 32:44.462
THIS‐‐I'VE HAD IT.

32:44.462 --> 32:46.590
WAIT!
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

32:46.590 --> 32:49.759
WE JUST MADE IT
ALL THE WAY HERE!
NO, NO!
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT!

32:49.759 --> 32:52.512
THE ONLY REASON THAT I TRIED
TO REACH ABOVE MY MEANS

32:52.512 --> 32:54.514
IS BECAUSE OF YOU,
BECAUSE I THOUGHT,

32:54.514 --> 32:57.100
"WHAT WOULD BETTY DO
IF SHE WERE IN MY POSITION?"

32:57.100 --> 32:58.685
SHE'D BE ALL LIKE...

32:58.685 --> 33:00.687
(high pitched)
"OH, REACH FOR THE STARS

33:00.687 --> 33:02.731
AND UNICORNS
AND LOLLIPOPS AND SUNFLOWERS!"

33:02.731 --> 33:04.733
(normal voice)
SO WHY CAN'T I?

33:04.733 --> 33:07.819
WELL... (chuckles)
LOOK AT ME! THIS IS WHY!

33:07.819 --> 33:09.196
(sighs)

33:09.196 --> 33:12.157
I HAVE HAD IT UP TO HERE
WITH YOUR SUNNY OPTIMISM.

33:12.157 --> 33:16.536
YEAH?! WELL, I'VE HAD IT
UP TO HERE WITH YOUR NEGATIVITY!

33:16.536 --> 33:20.415
ALL YOU EVER DO IS COMPLAIN.
"I'M MARC ST. JAMES.

33:20.415 --> 33:22.834
"EVERYTHING BAD HAPPENS TO ME!

33:22.834 --> 33:24.628
"I NEVER GET WHAT I WANT!

33:24.628 --> 33:27.297
I AM ALWAYS THE BUN!"

33:27.297 --> 33:29.299
HAVE YOU EVER TRIED,
JUST ONCE,

33:29.299 --> 33:31.801
TO THINK HAPPY THOUGHTS?

33:31.801 --> 33:33.345
OH, PLEASE.

33:33.345 --> 33:36.473
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO,
CLAP IF I BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?

33:36.473 --> 33:38.475
YEAH, I WANT YOU TO CLAP!
FINE!

33:38.475 --> 33:40.810
I BELIEVE IN FAIRIES,
BETTY!
WE BELIEVE!

33:40.810 --> 33:42.479
COME ON OUT!
DON'T FORGET YOUR FAIRY DUST!

33:42.479 --> 33:45.232
THAT'S GOOD!
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

33:45.232 --> 33:47.234
YOU'RE WELCOME.
EXCELLENT. (gasps)

33:49.236 --> 33:52.614
(screaming and laughing)
(screaming and laughing)
OH, MY GOD! OH, OH!

33:52.614 --> 33:54.866
OH! OH, GREAT, GREAT!

33:54.866 --> 33:56.868
COME ON, THEN.
YAY!

33:56.868 --> 33:58.536
COME ON!

34:00.705 --> 34:04.542
(sniffles and sighs)
HERE YOU GO, BOBBY.

34:04.542 --> 34:07.545
(scoffs)
IT'S NOT POISON, I PROMISE.
IT'S SCOTCH.

34:09.547 --> 34:11.341
YEAH, ALL RIGHT. THANKS.

34:11.341 --> 34:13.843
THANK YOU
FOR HELPING BETTY.

34:19.933 --> 34:22.519
AH.

34:24.562 --> 34:26.398
UH, LISTEN, UH...

34:26.398 --> 34:29.609
I'M SORRY I BLEW UP
AT YOU BEFORE, YOU KNOW?

34:29.609 --> 34:32.487
I, UH, I WAS TALKING
OUT OF MY ASS.

34:32.487 --> 34:35.490
I DIDN'T MEAN ANY OF IT.
YES, YOU DID.

34:35.490 --> 34:37.575
AND YOU WERE RIGHT.

34:37.575 --> 34:40.495
(chuckles) I WAS?

34:40.495 --> 34:41.913
WELL, PARTIALLY.

34:41.913 --> 34:45.917
I'M NOT TOTALLY CONVINCED
THAT YOU'RE NOT STILL A THUG.

34:45.917 --> 34:49.129
BUT THESE LAST FEW WEEKS,

34:49.129 --> 34:53.049
I'VE SEEN HOW GREAT YOU'VE BEEN
WITH HILDA AND JUSTIN.

34:53.049 --> 34:56.052
AND, UM...

34:56.052 --> 34:59.055
IT WAS HARD
TO SEE MYSELF REPLACED.

34:59.055 --> 35:03.059
I GUESS I, UH,
GOT A LITTLE JEALOUS.

35:03.059 --> 35:05.103
(laughs) WHAT, OF ME?

35:05.103 --> 35:06.730
MM, YEAH.

35:06.730 --> 35:09.524
GET OUTTA HERE. IT'S...

35:09.524 --> 35:12.319
I COULD NEVER TAKE
YOUR PLACE.
I KNOW.

35:12.319 --> 35:14.696
(both laughing)

35:14.696 --> 35:16.323
(electricity hums)

35:16.323 --> 35:19.326
WHOA. WOW.

35:19.326 --> 35:21.620
I REALLY MESSED YOU UP,
DIDN'T I?

35:23.496 --> 35:25.498
I'M JUST GONNA BE
TWO SECONDS.

35:25.498 --> 35:28.460
I WANT TO GRAB SOMETHING HERE
FROM MY DESK.

35:35.592 --> 35:37.135
I'M SORRY, MARC.

35:39.512 --> 35:41.514
WELL, WE TRIED.

35:47.520 --> 35:48.396
<i>(horror movie sound effects)</i>

35:48.396 --> 35:50.398
OH! (laughing)
DID YOU SEE HER HEAD?!

35:50.398 --> 35:52.984
OH, MAN!
IT ROLLED RIGHT OFF.
DISGUSTING!

35:52.984 --> 35:56.029
HEY, YOU'RE BACK!
HEY! (clears throat)
HOW WAS THE WALK‐THROUGH?

35:56.029 --> 35:58.031
(sighs) WE NEVER MADE IT.

35:58.031 --> 36:00.533
WE WERE STUCK IN THE SUBWAY
ALL NIGHT.

36:00.533 --> 36:03.536
WAIT. YOU‐‐YOU TEXTED ME
YOU WERE FINE.
YEAH, WELL, I'M NOT STUPID.

36:03.536 --> 36:05.664
IT WAS PITCH‐BLACK
AND TERRIFYING.

36:05.664 --> 36:07.582
SHOULD I HAVE TEXTED YOU THAT?
(laughs)

36:07.582 --> 36:10.168
I LEARNED TODAY
THAT MOM IS NOT GOOD

36:10.168 --> 36:13.129
IN HIGH‐PRESSURE SITUATIONS,

36:13.129 --> 36:16.049
SO SHE'S NOT COMING
TO MY AUDITION TOMORROW.

36:16.049 --> 36:19.302
WELL?

36:19.302 --> 36:22.305
BABY! WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR FACE?

36:22.305 --> 36:25.058
YOUR FATHER ATTACKED ME
WITH A PIE PAN.

36:25.058 --> 36:26.851
HEY, YOU GOT OFF EASY.

36:26.851 --> 36:30.021
YOU'RE LUCKY I DIDN'T USE
MY STEEL CASSEROLE DISH. POW!
(laughing)

36:30.021 --> 36:32.440
(Ignacio and Bobby laughing)

36:32.440 --> 36:36.194
OKAY, WAIT. WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
I AM SO CONFUSED.

36:36.194 --> 36:38.196
LET‐‐LET ME
CLEAR SOMETHING UP.

36:38.196 --> 36:40.782
UM, I'VE BEEN
A STUBBORN OLD MAN,

36:40.782 --> 36:43.576
AND I‐I‐I'M SORRY
FOR THE WAY I'VE BEEN ACTING.

36:43.576 --> 36:45.370
ANYWAY...

36:45.370 --> 36:47.372
IF THAT OFFER'S STILL GOOD

36:47.372 --> 36:50.375
FOR ME TO SEE
MY GRANDKID TOMORROW, I...

36:51.543 --> 36:54.337
I'D LIKE TO GO‐‐

36:54.337 --> 36:57.215
THAT IS,
IF BOBBY DOESN'T MIND.

36:57.215 --> 36:59.342
I'D LIKE THAT.
(Ignacio) ALL RIGHT.

36:59.342 --> 37:02.345
I'D LIKE THAT A LOT.
(Ignacio and Bobby chuckle)

37:02.345 --> 37:05.014
(Bobby) ALL RIGHT.
OKAY. (chuckles)

37:05.014 --> 37:07.767
(Marc) GOOD MORNING, WILLIE.

37:07.767 --> 37:09.769
UH, I GOT THAT STUFF
YOU WANTED.

37:09.769 --> 37:12.439
WHERE WOULD YOU LIKE ME
TO PUT IT? (clears throat)

37:12.439 --> 37:14.399
NEXT TO ME IS FINE.

37:14.399 --> 37:17.235
(Marc)
SO DID YOU AND DANIEL DECIDE

37:17.235 --> 37:19.487
WHICH OF YOU
I'D BE WORKING FOR YET?

37:19.487 --> 37:22.449
YES.
YOU'LL BE WORKING FOR ME...

37:22.449 --> 37:24.325
AS MY NEWEST FASHION EDITOR.

37:24.325 --> 37:27.162
GREAT.
I'M GLAD THAT YOU G‐‐

37:27.162 --> 37:30.415
WAIT.
DID YOU JUST SAY...

37:35.378 --> 37:37.422
CONGRATULATIONS.

37:39.257 --> 37:42.552
SO YOU HAD ME ORDER

37:42.552 --> 37:46.055
CHAMPAGNE AND FLOWERS
FOR ME?

37:46.055 --> 37:48.475
WELL, YOU DIDN'T HONESTLY THINK
I'D DO IT MYSELF, DID YOU?

37:48.475 --> 37:49.893
OF COURSE NOT.

37:49.893 --> 37:52.729
(chuckles) SO I'M
THE NEW SENIOR FASHION EDITOR?

37:52.729 --> 37:56.107
(laughs) YOU'RE KIDDING. YOU'RE
NOT QUALIFIED FOR THAT JOB.

37:56.107 --> 37:57.984
I DECIDED I DIDN'T NEED ONE.

37:57.984 --> 38:02.322
I'M GONNA USE THE MONEY FOR
OUR NEW JUNIOR FASHION EDITOR.
(clink)

38:02.322 --> 38:04.324
(chuckles)

38:04.324 --> 38:06.367
WILLIE, IS THIS PROMOTION

38:06.367 --> 38:09.662
JUST SO YOU COULD KEEP DANIEL
FROM WINNING ME?

38:09.662 --> 38:11.206
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

38:11.206 --> 38:13.833
YOU THINK
I'D GIVE YOU A PROMOTION

38:13.833 --> 38:16.336
IF YOU DIDN'T DESERVE IT?

38:16.336 --> 38:18.963
WILLIE, THANK YOU.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

38:18.963 --> 38:22.175
<i>I'M</i> NOT THE EMOTIONAL TYPE.
RIGHT.

38:22.175 --> 38:25.970
BUT, UH, YOU CAN WRITE YOURSELF
A NICE NOTE FROM ME.

38:25.970 --> 38:27.597
(chuckles)
MM.

38:30.308 --> 38:31.810
(clink)
(chuckles)

38:33.812 --> 38:35.855
THANK YOU.
(folder thuds)

38:51.996 --> 38:53.832
OH. OH!
EXCUSE ME.

38:53.832 --> 38:56.793
(Betty) SORRY.
I'VE NEVER HAD SO MANY PEOPLE
CRAMMED IN HERE AT ONE TIME.

38:56.793 --> 38:59.838
WELL,
WE'RE A TIGHT‐KNIT FAMILY.
I CAN SEE THAT.

38:59.838 --> 39:02.340
YEAH, THAT'S HOW WE DO IT.
(chuckles)

39:02.340 --> 39:05.051
HEY. WOW, LOOK AT THAT.
(gasps)

39:05.051 --> 39:08.137
HEY. HEY, THAT LITTLE DOT,
THAT‐‐THAT'S HIM?

39:08.137 --> 39:10.139
OR <i>HER.</i>

39:10.139 --> 39:11.641
YEAH, OR HER.

39:11.641 --> 39:14.727
(types)

39:14.727 --> 39:16.813
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

39:18.690 --> 39:20.859
I'M NOT SEEING A HEARTBEAT.

39:26.197 --> 39:28.741
ARE YOU SURE?

39:30.201 --> 39:33.913
I'M VERY SORRY.

39:42.714 --> 39:45.675
HEY.

39:45.675 --> 39:47.677
CAN I GET YOU ANYTHING?

39:49.679 --> 39:53.266
NO.

39:53.266 --> 39:55.518
I'M JUST THINKING.

39:55.518 --> 40:01.566
I'D FINALLY GOT MY HEAD AROUND
THIS BABY AND...

40:02.066 --> 40:05.278
HOW IT WAS GONNA FIT
INTO OUR LITTLE FAMILY.

40:06.738 --> 40:09.407
AND NOW WE WON'T EVEN BE ONE.

40:09.407 --> 40:10.909
HEY.

40:10.909 --> 40:12.660
HEY.

40:12.660 --> 40:15.413
LISTEN TO ME.
BABY OR NO BABY,

40:15.413 --> 40:17.749
WE'RE GONNA BE A FAMILY.

40:17.749 --> 40:20.710
ALL RIGHT?
I AM NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

40:20.710 --> 40:21.794
OKAY?

40:27.258 --> 40:30.720
WE THOUGHT
YOU MIGHT WANT SOMETHING.

40:30.720 --> 40:32.597
TEA AND COOKIES.
(Justin) WHOO!

40:32.597 --> 40:34.891
OH, MY GOD! I JUST GOT OFF
THE PHONE WITH LENA KORVINKA.

40:34.891 --> 40:36.726
SHE <i>LOVED</i> MY AUDITION

40:36.726 --> 40:40.688
AND WANTS TO FORMALLY INVITE ME
TO JOIN HER CLASS.
AAH!

40:40.688 --> 40:42.190
WHOO!
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?!

40:42.190 --> 40:44.192
(Betty) CONGRATULATIONS!
THAT'S GREAT! HEY!

40:44.192 --> 40:48.196
OH, MY GOD! OH, HONEY.
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.

40:51.783 --> 40:53.159
CONGRATULATIONS.

41:02.335 --> 41:03.586
HEY.

41:03.586 --> 41:04.754
HEY.

41:04.754 --> 41:06.756
I WAS IN THE HALLWAY

41:06.756 --> 41:08.758
AND I THOUGHT
I SMELLED SOMETHING,

41:08.758 --> 41:10.927
SO I JUST CAME OVER
TO MAKE SURE YOU WEREN'T DEAD.

41:10.927 --> 41:12.762
NOPE. STILL HERE.

41:12.762 --> 41:14.764
(newspaper thuds)

41:14.764 --> 41:17.600
OH, HEY, I HEARD
ABOUT YOUR PROMOTION.

41:17.600 --> 41:19.310
CONGRATULATIONS.

41:19.310 --> 41:21.771
YEAH. IT'S PRETTY CRAZY, RIGHT?
(clears throat)

41:21.771 --> 41:23.898
NO, I DON'T THINK
THAT'S CRAZY.

41:26.567 --> 41:29.153
UH, ANYWAY,
AMANDA'S NOT HERE AND, UH,

41:29.153 --> 41:31.864
I WAS JUST HANGING OUT
BY MYSELF OVER THERE.

41:31.864 --> 41:34.867
SO I WAS THINKING
MAYBE IF YOU WANTED TO,

41:34.867 --> 41:39.372
WE COULD WATCH TV AND MAKE FUN
OF PEOPLE'S CLOTHES.

41:39.372 --> 41:42.333
YOU MIGHT LEARN SOMETHING.

41:42.333 --> 41:45.044
I MEAN, IF YOU WANT TO.
WE DON'T HAVE TO.

41:45.044 --> 41:47.505
NO, NO! THAT WOULD BE FUN.

41:47.505 --> 41:49.716
OKAY.

41:49.716 --> 41:53.052
(man singing indistinctly)

41:53.052 --> 41:55.722
ARE YOU HUNGRY?
I HAVE SOME LEFTOVER PASTA.

41:55.722 --> 41:57.140
NO.

41:57.140 --> 41:58.558
NO?

41:58.558 --> 42:01.352
NO. I HATE PASTA.
