WEBVTT

00:05.839 --> 00:09.277
("Lilly"
by Pink Martini playing)

00:11.145 --> 00:13.347
* *

00:18.252 --> 00:21.289
* Lilly comes when
you stop to call her *

00:21.389 --> 00:24.992
* Lilly runs
when you look away *

00:25.093 --> 00:28.396
* Lilly leaves kisses
on your collar *

00:28.496 --> 00:29.863
* Lilly, Lilly,
Lilly, Lilly, stay... *

00:29.963 --> 00:31.332
Hello?

00:32.600 --> 00:35.569
(alarm ringing)

00:36.970 --> 00:38.606
* *

00:38.706 --> 00:41.942
TODD: ...I'm fine
staying up all night,

00:42.042 --> 00:44.245
but 6:00 a.m. is too early
for anybody to be awake.

00:44.345 --> 00:46.180
Ah, these donuts...

00:46.280 --> 00:47.615
SUSAN:
Voodoo Donuts.

00:47.715 --> 00:49.583
Come every Monday? And we're
not allowed to have any?

00:49.683 --> 00:50.884
These are the partner donuts.

00:50.984 --> 00:53.020
The Costco croissants
that we get...

00:53.121 --> 00:54.688
are down there.

00:54.788 --> 00:55.889
TODD:
That is so unfair.

00:55.989 --> 00:58.058
I want an
Oh Captain, My Captain.

00:58.159 --> 00:59.460
Or a Grape Ape.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.462
Look, she can't see us
and no one's around,

01:01.562 --> 01:02.463
so why don't
we just...

01:02.563 --> 01:04.498
Ow.
I would know.

01:04.598 --> 01:05.833
And what if a partner
asked me if you took one?

01:05.933 --> 01:07.368
I would have to tell them
the truth.

01:07.468 --> 01:09.002
I want to be
partner here one day.

01:09.103 --> 01:10.571
Okay, me stealing one donut

01:10.671 --> 01:12.340
being the downfall
of your entire career

01:12.440 --> 01:13.674
seems like bit
of a stretch to me,

01:13.774 --> 01:15.643
but I'll oblige.
I'm serious.

01:16.110 --> 01:17.811
Ooh, behind you.
Hmm?

01:19.713 --> 01:21.149
So, the partners get donuts,

01:21.249 --> 01:24.352
they get their floors waxed,
and they get nice chairs?

01:24.452 --> 01:25.386
This is ridiculous.

01:25.486 --> 01:27.121
I mean, look at this thing.

01:27.221 --> 01:30.191
Have I mentioned that I'm still
sitting on a rolling step stool?

01:30.291 --> 01:31.525
Only like 400 times.

01:31.625 --> 01:33.060
I have to go,
but do not take--

01:33.161 --> 01:36.764
Yes, do-not do-nut.
I wo-not. Just relax.

01:36.864 --> 01:38.766
Everybody relax.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.369
Agnes.

01:42.203 --> 01:43.437
Hi.

01:51.412 --> 01:53.247
(exhales)

01:53.347 --> 01:54.448
(laughs)

01:54.548 --> 01:55.783
(sharp inhale) Oof.

01:58.486 --> 01:59.887
Ah.

02:02.256 --> 02:04.024
How dare you?
What?

02:04.124 --> 02:05.659
Wait, Mom.
No, it's just a chair.

02:05.759 --> 02:07.728
I am not doing this.
You are impossible.

02:07.828 --> 02:09.397
But impossible
in which arena, exactly?

02:09.497 --> 02:10.398
Oh, Todd.

02:10.498 --> 02:11.532
Good morning.

02:11.632 --> 02:12.800
You told the
State Commissioner

02:12.900 --> 02:14.034
of Oregon...

02:14.134 --> 02:15.736
Miranda, very good work
on the Langdon case.

02:15.836 --> 02:17.771
...that I,
Margaret Wright,

02:17.871 --> 02:20.374
respected attorney
throughout Portland

02:20.474 --> 02:21.909
am basically
acting as your--

02:22.009 --> 02:22.810
Oh, Bob.

02:22.910 --> 02:24.512
You need to water that.

02:24.612 --> 02:25.546
--as your parole officer?

02:25.646 --> 02:26.980
I did?
Oh, my gosh.

02:27.080 --> 02:29.016
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait,
right, right, right.

02:29.116 --> 02:31.552
No, Mom. Listen.

02:31.652 --> 02:32.986
It's been two years
last week.

02:33.086 --> 02:34.422
I am no longer barred

02:34.522 --> 02:35.789
from holding an investigator's
license in Oregon.
Oh.

02:35.889 --> 02:37.191
I just need to pass
all these tests--

02:37.291 --> 02:38.459
did 'em online--

02:38.559 --> 02:39.860
take all these seminars--
did 'em online--

02:39.960 --> 02:42.062
complete all my nonsense
work hours and bingo,

02:42.162 --> 02:43.063
I get my license back.

02:43.163 --> 02:44.532
There.

02:44.632 --> 02:47.801
Now, 1,800 nonsense
hours. Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

02:47.901 --> 02:50.037
And your supervisor simply needs
to initial your time sheet?

02:50.137 --> 02:52.172
Yes, and that's you,
not Lyle.
Okay.

02:52.273 --> 02:56.510
So, you put in
183 hours last week?
Yeah.

02:56.610 --> 03:00.648
Todd, there are only
168 hours in a week.

03:00.748 --> 03:02.450
What? No, that
can't be right.

03:02.550 --> 03:03.651
Well, it is right.

03:03.751 --> 03:05.719
And you
backdated this

03:05.819 --> 03:09.523
to say that you started
working here nine months ago.

03:09.623 --> 03:12.159
I am not going to sign
a state document

03:12.260 --> 03:13.894
replete with lies
to help you

03:13.994 --> 03:16.497
get something that
you have not earned.

03:16.597 --> 03:17.531
Oh, come on.

03:17.631 --> 03:19.267
I can't be under
Lyle's thumb

03:19.367 --> 03:20.734
and rule and
supervision forever.

03:20.834 --> 03:22.336
It is
killing me.

03:22.436 --> 03:25.939
And I have done thousands
of hours of detective work.

03:26.039 --> 03:27.074
Over the years.

03:27.174 --> 03:28.942
Wait, how many
hours are in a year?

03:29.042 --> 03:31.245
It's got to be at
least a thousand, right?

03:31.345 --> 03:32.313
Hold this.

03:32.413 --> 03:33.547
If you get caught doing this,

03:33.647 --> 03:34.848
if I get caught
authorizing it,

03:34.948 --> 03:36.116
then we are done.
Our careers: over.

03:36.216 --> 03:37.551
Thank you, Jerry.

03:37.651 --> 03:38.986
(sighs) You sound like
Susan and the donuts.

03:39.086 --> 03:40.688
(mocking):
"Susan and the Donuts"?

03:40.788 --> 03:42.189
I don't want to talk indie
rock bands with you right now.

03:42.290 --> 03:43.524
This is serious.

03:43.624 --> 03:45.926
You have to
pay your dues,

03:46.026 --> 03:47.428
put in your time.

03:47.528 --> 03:48.929
You always want
something for nothing.

03:49.029 --> 03:50.298
Well, I don't want
nothing for something.

03:50.398 --> 03:51.665
Wait, stop.

03:53.667 --> 03:54.635
What's going
on with him?

03:54.735 --> 03:56.304
I don't know.

03:56.404 --> 03:57.771
Stay!

04:01.509 --> 04:02.843
Hey, Francey.
Hmm?

04:02.943 --> 04:04.412
What's going on?
With what?

04:04.512 --> 04:05.579
With Lyle.
He seems so...

04:05.679 --> 04:07.681
FRANCEY:
Oh, yeah. Sad story.

04:07.781 --> 04:09.082
TODD:
What's the story?

04:09.182 --> 04:11.084
His niece. She was
arrested this morning.

04:11.184 --> 04:12.252
For what?

04:12.353 --> 04:13.587
There was an explosion
last night

04:13.687 --> 04:15.155
in the Oregon City College
campus.

04:15.255 --> 04:16.156
In a laboratory.

04:16.256 --> 04:17.491
The Manticore Institute.

04:17.591 --> 04:18.526
The one on campus.

04:18.626 --> 04:19.927
And?

04:20.027 --> 04:21.562
And his niece, Angie Brooks,
was arrested.

04:21.662 --> 04:22.663
They think she blew up the lab.

04:22.763 --> 04:23.931
Lyle's niece blew up a lab?

04:24.031 --> 04:25.165
Shh.
Sorry, sorry.

04:25.265 --> 04:26.700
It's very serious.

04:26.800 --> 04:29.537
A scientist, Nicholas Armstrong,
was badly injured.

04:29.637 --> 04:30.704
He's in the hospital.

04:30.804 --> 04:32.840
Her arraignment
is this morning.

04:32.940 --> 04:35.443
Lyle wanted your mom to help.

04:36.510 --> 04:39.212
"Lyle's niece was arrested
for blowing up a laboratory"

04:39.313 --> 04:41.549
is never a sentence
I thought I'd say.

04:42.550 --> 04:44.985
* *

04:52.426 --> 04:55.095
Hi, Angie.

04:55.195 --> 04:56.397
Here, sit down.

04:56.497 --> 04:58.932
I'm Margaret Wright.
I work with your Uncle Lyle,

04:59.032 --> 05:01.502
and I will be defending you.
I didn't do this.

05:01.602 --> 05:02.936
No, of course,
of course.

05:03.036 --> 05:04.772
Uh, we'll talk about
all these details later.

05:04.872 --> 05:06.807
But right now,
your uncle tells me that you

05:06.907 --> 05:08.676
have no prior arrests,
is that correct?

05:08.776 --> 05:10.043
Yes, ma'am.
Okay.

05:10.143 --> 05:12.880
And you're on the dean's list?
Yes, ma'am.

05:14.181 --> 05:15.616
Okay.

05:15.716 --> 05:18.085
All rise for
Honorable Judge Mendelsohn.

05:19.853 --> 05:21.689
D.A. Boatman.

05:22.690 --> 05:24.658
And well, well, well,
Margaret Wright.

05:24.758 --> 05:26.093
Always a treat.

05:27.127 --> 05:28.762
What have you got for me today?

05:28.862 --> 05:30.564
Your Honor, I would ask
that you release my client

05:30.664 --> 05:32.433
on her own
recognizance.

05:32.533 --> 05:33.767
Uh, she has
no prior arrests,

05:33.867 --> 05:35.936
she is on
the dean's list.

05:36.036 --> 05:37.204
And she is an exemplary citizen.

05:37.304 --> 05:38.706
Your Honor.

05:38.806 --> 05:40.974
We have video evidence of
Angela Brooks entering the lab

05:41.074 --> 05:43.477
prior to the explosion with
a suspicious duffel bag.

05:43.577 --> 05:46.013
(murmuring, gasping)

05:46.113 --> 05:47.948
MENDELSOHN:
All righty, then.

05:48.048 --> 05:50.150
Given the violent nature
of this crime,

05:50.250 --> 05:53.621
I have no alternative
but to set bail at $30,000.

05:53.721 --> 05:55.355
(gavel bangs)

05:55.456 --> 05:56.590
BAILIFF:
All rise.

05:56.690 --> 05:58.726
$30,000?

05:58.826 --> 05:59.727
Where am I supposed to--

05:59.827 --> 06:01.395
I will take care of it.

06:01.495 --> 06:03.597
It's okay. He will get it back
once you show up for trial.

06:03.697 --> 06:05.433
And you will show up for trial.

06:05.533 --> 06:07.300
You can't tell
my mom about this.
Are you kidding me?

06:07.401 --> 06:09.136
You don't get
to decide who I tell.

06:09.236 --> 06:11.071
Uncle Lyle, please
don't talk to me...
I told your mother

06:11.171 --> 06:12.873
that I would take
care of you...
...like I'm a child, okay?

06:12.973 --> 06:13.974
...and I would keep
you out of trouble.
Okay.

06:14.808 --> 06:16.109
Go with the guard,
his name is Troy,

06:16.209 --> 06:17.411
and we'll get you
after you've been processed.

06:17.511 --> 06:18.946
It'll be fine,
go ahead.

06:20.448 --> 06:22.516
Lyle. Lyle.

06:22.616 --> 06:24.384
She'll be all right.

06:26.420 --> 06:27.888
* *

06:31.425 --> 06:33.060
Angie, this is you

06:33.160 --> 06:35.162
entering the Manticore Building
last night, correct?

06:35.262 --> 06:37.531
This is not
what it looks like, okay?

06:37.631 --> 06:39.967
And, Uncle Lyle, I can't believe
that you would even think

06:40.067 --> 06:41.569
that I would do
something like this.

06:41.669 --> 06:42.836
I'm not saying
you did it.

06:42.936 --> 06:45.539
I'm saying it looks like
you blew up a lab.

06:45.639 --> 06:47.074
Could you imagine
the optics in court?

06:47.174 --> 06:49.477
I was hanging posters
in protest of Manticore.

06:49.577 --> 06:50.978
Manticore.

06:51.078 --> 06:53.313
That's the chemical
manufacturing company, yes?

06:53.413 --> 06:56.183
Yes, um, they funded
the lab on campus.

06:56.283 --> 06:58.452
They also dump chemicals all
over the world. They're evil.

06:58.552 --> 07:01.789
Okay, and were you hanging
the posters on your own?

07:01.889 --> 07:03.156
No. I'm with Green Circles.

07:03.256 --> 07:04.458
It's this environmental group
on campus.

07:04.558 --> 07:05.793
Okay.
A terrorist group.

07:05.893 --> 07:07.394
ANGIE:
We are not terrorists.

07:07.495 --> 07:09.129
Angie, you are supposed
to be studying!

07:09.229 --> 07:11.765
We didn't do it.
We stage peaceful protests.

07:11.865 --> 07:12.833
Then-then what was this?

07:12.933 --> 07:13.901
Okay, were you in the building

07:14.001 --> 07:15.135
at the time of the explosion?

07:15.235 --> 07:17.204
ANGIE: I was,
um, supposed to be

07:17.304 --> 07:18.739
hanging posters
in the lab.

07:18.839 --> 07:20.941
Posters everywhere,
to humiliate them.

07:21.041 --> 07:22.342
But then,
when I got there,

07:22.442 --> 07:24.344
boom, the lab exploded
and I just ran out.

07:24.444 --> 07:27.481
Then why don't you
reappear on the video,

07:27.581 --> 07:28.882
coming out
of that door?

07:28.982 --> 07:30.518
I don't know.
I just dropped my duffel bag

07:30.618 --> 07:32.520
and then I just--
You dropped
your duffel bag?

07:32.620 --> 07:33.554
Angie, you left evidence?

07:33.654 --> 07:35.088
There was only posters in there.

07:35.188 --> 07:38.959
Lyle, why don't you
contact the D.A. and Manticore

07:39.059 --> 07:40.628
and see if you can't
get the footage

07:40.728 --> 07:43.030
from the other security cameras
on the site. All of them.

07:51.338 --> 07:55.208
Angie, your uncle
is very worried.

07:55.308 --> 07:56.043
Clearly, he cares

07:56.143 --> 07:58.345
about you
very much.

07:59.613 --> 08:01.048
He's supposed to be
watching over me.

08:01.148 --> 08:03.083
My parents live
pretty far away.

08:03.183 --> 08:05.085
And the only reason that I'm
allowed to go to school here

08:05.185 --> 08:08.956
is because Uncle
Lyle's nearby.

08:09.056 --> 08:11.191
But he wants me to be him.

08:11.291 --> 08:13.293
Be just like him.
Do what he does.

08:13.393 --> 08:16.664
Mm-hmm.
And he doesn't care
about the environment.

08:16.764 --> 08:18.465
Not the way that I do.

08:18.566 --> 08:20.267
He doesn't understand
Green Circles.

08:20.367 --> 08:23.837
Green Circles.
That is the environmental group?

08:23.937 --> 08:25.706
Yeah, we want our kids to have
clean air

08:25.806 --> 08:26.707
and clean drinking water.

08:26.807 --> 08:29.209
And rightly so.

08:29.309 --> 08:32.212
But why are you targeting
Manticore, specifically?

08:32.312 --> 08:34.014
Because the waste
that they dump

08:34.114 --> 08:36.316
leaches into the water supply,
and is combustible.

08:37.785 --> 08:39.152
Combustible?

08:39.252 --> 08:40.220
Mm-hmm.

08:40.320 --> 08:41.855
If you're able
to recover any data

08:41.955 --> 08:44.191
from the backup
drive, let us know.

08:47.795 --> 08:50.564
Okay, what'd you find?

08:50.664 --> 08:52.099
The D.A. and
Manticore insist

08:52.199 --> 08:54.001
that we have all
existing footage.

08:54.101 --> 08:55.836
That all the other
security cameras

08:55.936 --> 08:57.437
shorted out as a result
of the explosion.

08:57.537 --> 09:00.073
Well, that's convenient
for whoever blew things up.

09:00.173 --> 09:01.875
But if Angie is correct,

09:01.975 --> 09:03.811
and Manticore deals
in combustible chemicals,

09:03.911 --> 09:05.045
then maybe...

09:05.145 --> 09:07.014
Maybe the lab
combusted itself?

09:08.348 --> 09:10.684
Lyle, why don't you go
pay the lab a visit?

09:10.784 --> 09:13.386
The injured scientist
had a partner.

09:13.486 --> 09:15.455
See if you can find him.
Find out what he knows.

09:15.555 --> 09:17.591
All right.
Okay?

09:21.895 --> 09:23.597
Hey.

09:24.364 --> 09:26.700
Okay, uh, Todd, Todd...
Huh?

09:26.800 --> 09:28.168
Lyle is very
upset about this.

09:28.268 --> 09:30.704
I want you to go with
him and watch over him.

09:30.804 --> 09:31.905
Make sure he doesn't
lose his temper.

09:32.005 --> 09:35.008
Wait. You want me
to babysit him?

09:35.108 --> 09:36.844
Yes.
Just to confirm:

09:36.944 --> 09:38.712
You want me babysitting Lyle?

09:38.812 --> 09:40.047
Yes.

09:40.147 --> 09:41.949
Yes. Yes,
a million times yes.
Jacket.

09:42.049 --> 09:44.484
What? Yeah, of course,
yes, mm-hmm.

09:46.086 --> 09:47.520
Thank you.

09:51.759 --> 09:53.493
Just so you know,
I got your back.

09:53.593 --> 09:54.795
I'm serious.

09:54.895 --> 09:57.831
Look, this case is
very personal to you.

09:57.931 --> 09:59.332
I get that you're upset

09:59.432 --> 10:01.068
and my mom wants me
to watch out for you.

10:01.168 --> 10:02.469
You know, as your
supervisor.

10:02.569 --> 10:03.837
You're supervising me?

10:03.937 --> 10:06.106
Yeah, I mean, you know,
whatever, I'm in charge.

10:06.206 --> 10:07.207
Your niece is in trouble.

10:07.307 --> 10:08.441
You can't be
objective. I get it.

10:08.541 --> 10:09.677
Oh, you get it?

10:09.777 --> 10:11.078
Has your niece
ever been in trouble?

10:11.178 --> 10:12.746
My niece is three.
When my niece was three,

10:12.846 --> 10:13.847
I was working with the general

10:13.947 --> 10:15.348
for the National
Security Agency.

10:15.448 --> 10:18.085
I had four top-level clearances
and I owned my own home.

10:18.185 --> 10:19.787
But you live
in a garage?

10:19.887 --> 10:22.122
Hey, it's not a
competition, okay?

10:22.222 --> 10:23.323
My niece would
never blow up a lab.

10:23.423 --> 10:25.158
My niece didn't
blow up a lab.

10:25.258 --> 10:27.627
And she doesn't have
a fool for an uncle, either.
A fool?

10:27.728 --> 10:31.498
Are you kidding? My niece thinks
I'm straight-up hilarious.

10:33.200 --> 10:34.902
Your niece
is three.

10:35.002 --> 10:36.269
(Todd sighs)

10:39.707 --> 10:41.008
Mr. Ponce?

10:41.875 --> 10:43.276
Mr. Ponce?
Yes.

10:43.376 --> 10:44.644
Lyle Burton.

10:44.745 --> 10:46.780
We spoke on the phone.
This is my assistant.

10:46.880 --> 10:47.815
Well, Assistant General.

10:47.915 --> 10:48.916
It's a higher level

10:49.016 --> 10:50.283
of private detective.

10:50.383 --> 10:51.685
I mean, you wouldn't
really understand it,

10:51.785 --> 10:52.886
but I do
outrank him.

10:52.986 --> 10:54.521
PONCE: Sorry,
I'm a bit distracted.

10:54.621 --> 10:57.891
Nicholas, my research partner,
is in the hospital.

10:57.991 --> 11:00.527
And I've had to move everything
to annex and continue our work.

11:00.627 --> 11:02.796
Well, what exactly
are you working on?

11:02.896 --> 11:04.197
And what are in
all these jars?

11:04.297 --> 11:06.466
PONCE:
Don't touch that!

11:06.566 --> 11:08.201
Unless you want
another explosion.

11:08.301 --> 11:09.770
Another explosion?

11:09.870 --> 11:13.206
So, your work does involve
combustible compounds.

11:13.306 --> 11:16.343
Yes, there are
hazardous byproducts.

11:16.443 --> 11:18.979
We are trying to solve
the world's plastic problem.

11:19.079 --> 11:21.048
And we've found a way
to dissolve it.

11:21.148 --> 11:23.550
Manticore might
be seen as evil,

11:23.650 --> 11:27.554
but this work,
that they're funding, is good.

11:27.654 --> 11:28.722
So, then...

11:28.822 --> 11:29.957
is that what
Nicholas was working on

11:30.057 --> 11:31.391
the night of
the accident?

11:32.692 --> 11:33.593
It wasn't an accident.

11:33.693 --> 11:34.962
Our lab was blown up

11:35.062 --> 11:35.996
by a bomb.

11:36.096 --> 11:37.297
They've confirmed that.

11:37.397 --> 11:38.331
And, uh, where were
you that night?

11:38.431 --> 11:39.767
I already told
the police.

11:39.867 --> 11:41.401
I went to dinner
with my boyfriend

11:41.501 --> 11:44.504
and then I was on a plastics
panel at the Everlane Hotel.

11:44.604 --> 11:46.206
Remind me who
you're working for again?

11:46.306 --> 11:48.341
Uh, we're representing
Angie Brooks.

11:48.441 --> 11:49.743
Wait. The freak who
blew up my lab?

11:49.843 --> 11:51.644
Don't talk about
her like that.
Okay, okay.

11:51.745 --> 11:52.712
She's not a freak.

11:52.813 --> 11:53.947
Angie's just, you know,

11:54.047 --> 11:55.315
getting her Greta Thunberg on,

11:55.415 --> 11:56.917
trying to save the world
one poster at a time

11:57.017 --> 12:00.287
with her eco group, what is it?
Uh, Green Circles.

12:00.387 --> 12:02.756
Green Circles is just a front
for Eco-Battalion.

12:03.991 --> 12:05.292
What's... Eco-Battalion?

12:05.392 --> 12:07.660
The environmental
terrorist group?

12:07.761 --> 12:09.096
They sank that
fishing boat in Alaska.

12:09.196 --> 12:11.698
They torched that farm in Idaho.

12:11.799 --> 12:14.034
They kill people!
Angie Brooks

12:14.134 --> 12:16.636
is a maniac who blew up my lab
and tried to kill Nicholas.

12:16.736 --> 12:18.271
Now wait just a minute,
you're not gonna talk about--

12:18.371 --> 12:19.873
Get out!
Okay, okay, okay.

12:19.973 --> 12:22.175
Okay, we're going. Come on.

12:23.676 --> 12:25.045
So, just to recap:

12:25.145 --> 12:27.214
your niece is a
murderous eco-terrorist?

12:27.314 --> 12:29.850
All my niece does
is watch Blue's Clues.

12:29.950 --> 12:32.185
* *

12:39.993 --> 12:41.394
We are not
Eco-Battalion!

12:41.494 --> 12:42.662
Okay?

12:42.762 --> 12:43.596
Green Circles
is a peaceful group.

12:43.696 --> 12:44.697
Peaceful.

12:44.798 --> 12:46.133
Angie, this
is very serious.

12:46.233 --> 12:48.001
Homeland Security
is now involved.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.669
You have to
tell the truth.

12:49.769 --> 12:51.204
They could put you away
for a very long time.

12:51.304 --> 12:52.505
What, like in prison?

12:52.605 --> 12:53.874
Life in prison.

12:53.974 --> 12:56.910
You are being accused
of detonating a bomb.

12:57.010 --> 12:59.079
Angie, think. Is-is there
anyone new in the group?

12:59.179 --> 13:01.815
A new member or
maybe a new leader?

13:05.452 --> 13:07.154
Okay. There's Rafe.

13:07.254 --> 13:08.488
Rafe?

13:08.588 --> 13:09.489
Okay...

13:09.589 --> 13:11.291
There's something.

13:11.391 --> 13:12.692
Uh, who is this Rafe?

13:12.792 --> 13:14.627
And-and why are you just
telling us about him now?

13:14.727 --> 13:17.230
Well, he started coming to our
meetings like six months ago.

13:17.330 --> 13:18.531
He's older. Maybe 22.

13:18.631 --> 13:20.200
Ooh, ancient.

13:20.300 --> 13:21.801
I mean, he's been all over
the globe, he knows everything.

13:21.902 --> 13:23.070
Oh, he knows everything?
Does he happen to know

13:23.170 --> 13:24.537
who blew up the lab,
by any chance?

13:24.637 --> 13:25.839
LYLE: Did he influence
your group to, uh,

13:25.939 --> 13:28.608
take larger actions?
To be violent?

13:28.708 --> 13:31.111
No, no. Completely the opposite.

13:31.211 --> 13:33.847
He's all about peace
and, um, mediation.

13:33.947 --> 13:35.715
And, listen, he's
a really good guy

13:35.815 --> 13:36.716
and he's really,
really smart.

13:36.816 --> 13:38.385
And he thought it would...

13:38.485 --> 13:40.653
He thought it would be
a good idea to poster the lab.

13:40.753 --> 13:42.655
But he didn't
go with you?

13:42.755 --> 13:44.257
Why didn't you
mention this earlier?

13:45.225 --> 13:46.126
MARGARET:
Angie...

13:46.226 --> 13:48.095
I am your lawyer.

13:48.195 --> 13:49.762
We are trying
to protect you,

13:49.863 --> 13:51.598
but-but you are
burying information

13:51.698 --> 13:53.500
protecting this boy.
Okay.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.903
When I left the building,
I thought I saw someone running.

13:56.003 --> 13:58.005
What?
And I couldn't make
out who it was,

13:58.105 --> 14:00.840
but it did look
sort of like Rafe.

14:00.941 --> 14:02.342
And I'm sorry

14:02.442 --> 14:04.277
and I know I should've
told you guys this sooner,

14:04.377 --> 14:05.812
but I know Rafe and I know he
wouldn't do anything like this.

14:05.913 --> 14:08.415
Okay, so let's call Rafe

14:08.515 --> 14:09.917
and ask him to come down

14:10.017 --> 14:11.384
so we can ask him
a few questions.
Okay, or...

14:11.484 --> 14:13.020
We slide someone

14:13.120 --> 14:15.655
into his world to get info
without raising suspicion.

14:15.755 --> 14:17.457
LYLE:
No, not this time.

14:17.557 --> 14:20.527
If we do this, then this
operation needs to be precise.
Mm. Mm-hmm.

14:20.627 --> 14:21.694
And carefully thought out.

14:21.794 --> 14:22.862
Yeah. When I have
not been precise

14:22.963 --> 14:23.931
and carefully thought out?

14:24.031 --> 14:25.598
LYLE: Ms. Wright
and I will go.

14:25.698 --> 14:27.300
My niece is involved.

14:30.303 --> 14:31.671
Manticore Institute is toxic!
(chanting): Hey, hey, ho, ho,

14:31.771 --> 14:33.340
Manticore has got to go!

14:33.440 --> 14:35.442
Hey, hey, ho, ho,

14:35.542 --> 14:37.344
Manticore has got to go.

14:37.444 --> 14:39.779
(chanting continues)

14:41.114 --> 14:42.983
Ms. Wright,
there he is.

14:43.083 --> 14:43.850
Rafe.

14:43.951 --> 14:45.852
Hey, hey, ho, ho...

14:45.953 --> 14:47.787
Yo, Saffron, keep them going.
I'll catch up, okay?

14:47.887 --> 14:49.489
Ho, ho, Manticore...

14:49.589 --> 14:51.959
Yo, Angie. My eco-angel.

14:52.059 --> 14:53.660
I heard about
the arrest.

14:53.760 --> 14:54.661
I'm glad
you made it.

14:54.761 --> 14:55.963
Yeah, I wouldn't
miss it.

14:56.063 --> 14:56.964
Uh, Rafe,
this is...

14:57.064 --> 14:58.898
I'm her uncle. Hello.

14:58.999 --> 15:02.435
Ooh, wow. That's some grip.
Were you in the military?

15:03.603 --> 15:05.973
I'll take that as a yes.

15:06.073 --> 15:07.840
And I'm her attorney,
Margaret Wright.

15:07.941 --> 15:08.875
Yo. It's good to see you here.

15:08.976 --> 15:09.876
Even though your generation

15:09.977 --> 15:10.910
made most of the mess

15:11.011 --> 15:12.212
we're trying
to clean up.

15:12.312 --> 15:13.746
I beg your pardon?

15:13.846 --> 15:15.282
I worked three years

15:15.382 --> 15:17.284
on the Umpqua Forest and
Waterways Protection lawsuit.

15:17.384 --> 15:19.352
We went all the way
to the Oregon Supreme Court

15:19.452 --> 15:20.920
and won.

15:21.021 --> 15:23.523
RAFE: Well, dang.
Then I beg your pardon.

15:23.623 --> 15:26.826
It's dope you came out here
to support Angie and the cause.

15:27.827 --> 15:29.963
What happened to her
is totally unfair.

15:30.063 --> 15:31.398
That's great, because
we have a few questions

15:31.498 --> 15:33.333
for you about the night
of the explosion.

15:36.503 --> 15:39.806
Sure, sure. We'll get to
that right after the rally.

15:39.906 --> 15:41.008
Let's do this, then.

15:41.108 --> 15:42.709
Hey, hey, ho, ho!

15:42.809 --> 15:44.144
Manticore has
got to go.

15:44.244 --> 15:45.245
Hey, hey,

15:45.345 --> 15:47.914
ho, ho,
Manticore has got to go.

15:48.015 --> 15:49.716
Hey, hey, ho, ho,

15:49.816 --> 15:51.284
Manticore has got to go.

15:51.384 --> 15:52.919
Listen up.

15:53.020 --> 15:55.188
We have a special guest with us.

15:55.288 --> 15:59.726
A trailblazing attorney
who defends activists.

15:59.826 --> 16:02.162
Someone who believes like we do

16:02.262 --> 16:03.896
in Angie Brooks' innocence.

16:03.997 --> 16:05.065
-(cheering)
-(applause)

16:05.165 --> 16:06.566
RAFE:
Please help me welcome

16:06.666 --> 16:08.168
attorney Margaret Wright.

16:08.268 --> 16:12.005
-(cheers)
-(applause)

16:15.875 --> 16:17.244
I'm not a speaker, really.
Oh, it's easy,

16:17.344 --> 16:19.079
they're an easy crowd.
I'm very uncomfortable.

16:19.179 --> 16:20.447
You'll do fine.
This is not in my
wheelhouse at all.

16:20.547 --> 16:21.914
This is great.

16:22.015 --> 16:24.017
Okay. You know, I'm just
gonna put this thing down.

16:24.117 --> 16:25.418
I don't think I need it, do I?

16:25.518 --> 16:26.419
You can all hear me?

16:26.519 --> 16:28.155
(cheering)

16:30.457 --> 16:31.791
You. Raise that sign.

16:32.692 --> 16:34.961
You are absolutely right.

16:35.062 --> 16:38.165
We are putting
plastic over people.

16:38.265 --> 16:40.267
And-and I don't mean
Saran wrap on a dish.

16:40.367 --> 16:45.004
I mean, when did stuff
become more important

16:45.105 --> 16:47.607
than human beings and animals?

16:47.707 --> 16:52.379
The byproduct of Manticore's
work is toxic waste!

16:52.479 --> 16:53.713
(cheering)

16:53.813 --> 16:56.449
MARGARET:
What we are doing
to this planet

16:56.549 --> 16:58.151
is devastating.

16:58.251 --> 17:00.953
We have to have
no more plastic ever!

17:01.054 --> 17:02.889
-(cheering)
-(whooping)

17:02.989 --> 17:05.592
Except maybe for
the occasional Ziploc bag.

17:05.692 --> 17:06.793
(booing)

17:06.893 --> 17:08.328
Oh, no, you...

17:08.428 --> 17:11.231
Ugh, you are absolutely right.
You are right.

17:11.331 --> 17:14.967
I am addicted to plastic
and convenience.

17:15.068 --> 17:17.404
And that is
my generation's fault.

17:17.504 --> 17:18.771
But what about you?

17:18.871 --> 17:21.941
You say you want
to change the world?

17:22.041 --> 17:24.244
Get your noses
out of your cell phones.

17:24.344 --> 17:27.447
That you pay for with plastic.

17:27.547 --> 17:30.817
And stop posting pictures of
every single thing that you eat.

17:30.917 --> 17:32.219
No one cares.

17:32.319 --> 17:35.388
There are starving people
all over the world.

17:35.488 --> 17:38.057
And don't "like" everything.
Like, like, like, like, like.

17:38.158 --> 17:40.227
It doesn't mean anything.
Just go vote!

17:40.327 --> 17:43.396
Pay your rent in cash
and for God's sake

17:43.496 --> 17:47.066
get your boxes out
of your mother's house.

17:47.167 --> 17:50.470
And move out
of your sister's garage.

17:50.570 --> 17:53.039
We need to make
some hard choices.

17:53.140 --> 17:55.575
No more plastic,
no more convenience.

17:55.675 --> 17:56.943
Hard choices.

18:03.383 --> 18:04.451
Um...

18:05.585 --> 18:07.254
You all look very nice,

18:07.354 --> 18:10.557
with your signs
and you-you've clearly

18:10.657 --> 18:13.025
put a lot of effort
into this protest.

18:13.126 --> 18:16.129
(cheering)

18:23.102 --> 18:27.039
Hey, hey, ho, ho,
Manticore has got to go.

18:27.140 --> 18:28.408
Hey, hey, ho, ho...

18:28.508 --> 18:32.011
And if you know anything
about the explosion

18:32.111 --> 18:34.681
at the Manticore Institute,

18:34.781 --> 18:37.550
please tell me.

18:43.890 --> 18:45.725
Hey, hey, ho, ho,
Manticore has got to go.

18:45.825 --> 18:49.028
(booing)

18:50.630 --> 18:52.131
I am trying to get to work.

18:52.232 --> 18:54.301
Oh, work? Really? You work's
the problem here, man.

18:54.401 --> 18:55.335
What the hell?

18:55.435 --> 18:57.337
I thought they
arrested you.

18:57.437 --> 18:58.471
Move it, tree bitch.

18:58.571 --> 18:59.772
Don't touch me.

18:59.872 --> 19:00.940
You hurt her,
you'll be on your back

19:01.040 --> 19:02.609
before you know what hit you.

19:05.412 --> 19:06.879
(booing)

19:08.881 --> 19:10.617
Thank you, Lyle. Thank you.

19:10.717 --> 19:11.651
Uh, where's Rafe?

19:11.751 --> 19:13.386
I have questions
for him.

19:13.486 --> 19:15.488
No sign of him.
I think he's gone.

19:15.588 --> 19:16.989
I can't believe
he just left.

19:17.089 --> 19:18.658
Okay, all right,

19:18.758 --> 19:20.193
you follow
the protesters.

19:20.293 --> 19:22.462
And-and see if you
can learn anything.

19:22.562 --> 19:23.796
I'll catch up with you.
All right.

19:23.896 --> 19:25.265
Good job.
You okay?

19:25.365 --> 19:27.133
Yeah, I'm good.

19:27.967 --> 19:31.103
You took me right back
to my first protest.

19:31.904 --> 19:33.373
Oh, yeah?
What were you protesting for?

19:33.473 --> 19:36.876
No nukes. It was right after
Three Mile Island.

19:37.977 --> 19:39.045
That's really cool.
Mm-hmm.

19:39.145 --> 19:40.847
I had the same
kind commitment.

19:42.249 --> 19:43.250
What's your name?

19:43.350 --> 19:46.319
Uh, Saffron Lind.

19:46.419 --> 19:48.788
You're not going
to the march?

19:48.888 --> 19:50.523
(sighs)

19:50.623 --> 19:52.525
Yeah.

19:54.927 --> 19:57.930
Um, what you said
in your speech...

19:58.030 --> 20:00.367
we have to make hard choices.

20:01.268 --> 20:03.236
Is there something
that you know?

20:05.938 --> 20:07.907
Yeah.

20:08.007 --> 20:10.109
But what if the thing I know

20:10.209 --> 20:12.445
is that somebody asked me
to do something and I did it

20:12.545 --> 20:15.214
because I really thought
it was the right thing to do,

20:15.315 --> 20:18.017
but now I'm not so sure?

20:18.117 --> 20:20.219
Does this have to do with Rafe?

20:20.320 --> 20:22.455
I-I don't want to get him
in trouble.

20:22.555 --> 20:25.892
Angie is the one in trouble.

20:25.992 --> 20:28.928
If she gets convicted,
she goes to prison for life.

20:30.697 --> 20:32.031
This is all my fault.

20:32.999 --> 20:34.334
Just tell me what you know.

20:36.369 --> 20:37.937
Okay.

20:39.939 --> 20:42.174
Okay, so, two months ago,

20:42.275 --> 20:45.111
Rafe asked me to get a job
as a janitor at Manticore,

20:45.211 --> 20:47.680
so I could get the keys
to the lab.

20:47.780 --> 20:50.717
And I-I was just
such an idiot and...

20:50.817 --> 20:53.019
He told me it was
for the cause, so I did it.

20:53.119 --> 20:55.988
I gave him the keys
to the lab.

20:56.088 --> 20:58.925
Are you telling me that
on the night of the explosion,

20:59.025 --> 21:00.993
Rafe had access to the lab?

21:01.994 --> 21:03.696
Yeah.

21:05.197 --> 21:07.033
And I think he did it.

21:09.201 --> 21:11.704
Would you tell
the police that?

21:14.841 --> 21:16.443
You know what?

21:16.543 --> 21:18.445
Yeah.

21:18.545 --> 21:19.779
Yeah, screw Rafe.

21:19.879 --> 21:22.482
I'm tired of
protecting him.

21:22.582 --> 21:24.617
I'll tell them
everything.

21:26.953 --> 21:28.955
Hey, Susan,
what are you doing?

21:29.055 --> 21:30.757
This Aeron chair
belongs to partner

21:30.857 --> 21:32.224
Beverly Crest.
No.

21:32.325 --> 21:33.860
Her assistant asked me
if I knew where it was.

21:33.960 --> 21:35.261
And I didn't,
until I saw it in your office.

21:35.362 --> 21:36.863
Okay, it's just a chair.

21:36.963 --> 21:38.465
It's a $2,000 chair.

21:38.565 --> 21:40.467
And Crest is
still in Paris.

21:40.567 --> 21:42.301
Then it's a 2,034 Euros chair.

21:42.402 --> 21:44.637
Did you just do that math
in your head?

21:44.737 --> 21:46.072
When partner Beverly Crest
gets back,

21:46.172 --> 21:47.974
this chair will
be in her office.
Okay.

21:48.074 --> 21:49.241
I'm not
covering for you.

21:49.342 --> 21:50.643
I am not aiding
and abetting you.

21:50.743 --> 21:51.911
I am trying to be
a partner here.

21:52.011 --> 21:54.180
Okay, look, I got to go,

21:54.280 --> 21:56.115
but I want to let you know
that my happiness

21:56.215 --> 21:57.750
hinges on being able
to sit in that chair.

21:57.850 --> 21:59.386
(sighs)

21:59.486 --> 22:00.920
Then I'm sorry for your loss.

22:01.020 --> 22:02.088
Goodbye.

22:04.323 --> 22:06.926
I'm scared.
Here.

22:07.026 --> 22:09.462
It's good to eat something
sweet. It calms your nerves.

22:09.562 --> 22:10.863
100% organic.

22:10.963 --> 22:14.033
So, is there going to be
a jury and all that?

22:14.133 --> 22:16.002
No. This is your
preliminary hearing.

22:16.102 --> 22:17.704
This is where
the judge decides

22:17.804 --> 22:19.506
if they have enough
evidence to move against you.

22:19.606 --> 22:21.974
And since that activist,
Saffron, went to the police

22:22.074 --> 22:24.176
and told them about
Rafe having the key,

22:24.276 --> 22:26.345
that should help
Angie's case, right?
That is right.

22:26.446 --> 22:29.115
And since all the other
security camera footage

22:29.215 --> 22:33.152
was destroyed in the bombing,
I think we're good, okay?

22:33.252 --> 22:34.554
Okay.
Okay.

22:34.654 --> 22:35.788
Come on. Here.
Ugh.

22:35.888 --> 22:38.925
Eat this. Eat this.
Okay.

22:40.092 --> 22:41.461
Did you know
Saffron very well?

22:41.561 --> 22:42.895
Yeah.

22:42.995 --> 22:44.931
I mean, I know everyone
at Green Circles.

22:45.031 --> 22:47.700
Saffron's cool.
She knows the guy that got hurt.

22:47.800 --> 22:49.268
Mmm.
She's been pretty bummed lately.

22:49.368 --> 22:50.302
They're friends, so...

22:50.403 --> 22:51.738
Nicholas Armstrong?
Mm-hmm.

22:51.838 --> 22:53.873
Yeah, she says he's a great guy.

22:53.973 --> 22:55.608
I mean, he even volunteers
at the hospital.

22:55.708 --> 22:57.410
Oh, I bet he
knows Allison.

22:57.510 --> 23:00.046
I just still can't believe Rafe.

23:00.146 --> 23:01.948
I'm sorry he wasn't
who you thought he was.

23:03.516 --> 23:05.317
Margaret, I'm adding two new
charges to Ms. Brooks' case.

23:05.418 --> 23:08.120
What?
The first one being
domestic terrorism.

23:08.220 --> 23:09.321
Why?

23:09.422 --> 23:10.823
The police found
the missing duffel bag

23:10.923 --> 23:12.525
with the posters and fertilizer

23:12.625 --> 23:15.161
and hydrogen peroxide
and other bomb materials

23:15.261 --> 23:17.029
in Ms. Brooks'
dorm room.

23:17.129 --> 23:18.465
Okay, Uncle Lyle, there's no way
that that was in my dorm room.

23:18.565 --> 23:19.866
Don't say
another word.

23:19.966 --> 23:21.501
Ms. Wright, what is--
Hold on.

23:21.601 --> 23:22.602
What is
the second charge?

23:22.702 --> 23:24.403
Murder.

23:24.504 --> 23:26.939
What are you
talking about?
This is murder?

23:27.039 --> 23:28.407
Nicholas Armstrong
just died of his injuries.

23:28.508 --> 23:30.142
We are putting Ms.
Brooks under arrest.

23:30.242 --> 23:31.878
Wait, wait, what--
Oh, my God.

23:31.978 --> 23:33.245
Angie, it's gonna be okay.
We're gonna get to
the bottom of it.

23:33.345 --> 23:34.981
Uncle Lyle!
Okay. It'll be...

23:35.081 --> 23:37.283
Angie, the only thing
you say from this moment on

23:37.383 --> 23:39.486
is "I want my lawyer"!

23:47.994 --> 23:49.896
Oh, hi. I'm looking
for my daughter,

23:49.996 --> 23:51.297
Dr. Allison Grant.

23:51.397 --> 23:52.565
Where's the
on-call room?

23:52.665 --> 23:54.967
It's over there.
Thank you.

23:57.103 --> 23:58.905
(whispering):
Allison?

23:59.005 --> 24:00.172
Hello?

24:00.272 --> 24:01.708
Allison?

24:05.011 --> 24:06.713
(snoring)

24:08.247 --> 24:09.716
Allison?

24:09.816 --> 24:11.350
Allison?

24:11.450 --> 24:12.719
(gasps)
Sorry.

24:12.819 --> 24:13.986
Sorry, sorry.

24:14.086 --> 24:16.422
Oh. Allison, honey.

24:16.523 --> 24:18.691
Ooh, sorry.
Your hair is just like hers.

24:19.325 --> 24:20.392
Ooh. I'm sorry, sorry.
(grunts)

24:20.493 --> 24:21.728
Go back to sleep.

24:28.167 --> 24:29.068
Allison? (yelps)

24:29.168 --> 24:30.169
Oh. Oh, God.

24:30.269 --> 24:31.504
MARGARET:
I'm sorry.

24:31.604 --> 24:33.105
Oh, God, you scared me.
You scared me.

24:33.205 --> 24:34.273
What are you doing here?

24:34.373 --> 24:37.910
Well, Allison, I need your help.

24:38.010 --> 24:39.311
My client is in jail.

24:39.411 --> 24:42.148
And I'm going through all
the loose ends of the case.

24:42.248 --> 24:45.351
I need some information about a
volunteer here at your hospital.

24:45.451 --> 24:46.719
Are you kidding me?

24:46.819 --> 24:50.056
Mom, I'm resting between
back-to-back shifts.

24:50.156 --> 24:51.357
What do you want?

24:51.457 --> 24:53.593
Well, the volunteer office
is closed.

24:53.693 --> 24:56.095
Yes, because it's
the middle of the night.

24:56.195 --> 24:57.530
Allison, do you

24:57.630 --> 24:59.632
know a Nicholas Armstrong--

24:59.732 --> 25:01.133
Can you please keep it down?

25:01.233 --> 25:02.234
Sorry, I'm sorry,

25:02.334 --> 25:03.670
Jean, just go back to sleep.

25:03.770 --> 25:06.338
No, I don't know anything
about any volunteers.

25:06.438 --> 25:08.675
Even the ones who work with you?

25:08.775 --> 25:12.812
Mom, we do not have volunteers
in the emergency room.

25:12.912 --> 25:15.381
I don't even know
the volunteer coordinator here.

25:15.481 --> 25:17.784
I do.
You do?

25:17.884 --> 25:21.520
Yes. Her name is
Britney Kinsette.

25:21.621 --> 25:23.723
Kinsette. Sounds like "kismet."

25:24.724 --> 25:26.392
Do you have her phone number?

25:26.492 --> 25:28.561
Hang on.

25:28.661 --> 25:31.463
Ask her if she knows
a Nicholas Armstrong.

25:31.564 --> 25:33.866
Why do you need
to talk to Britney?

25:33.966 --> 25:35.301
Oh, hello.

25:35.401 --> 25:36.803
I'm Margaret,
Allison's mother.

25:36.903 --> 25:38.304
Oh, my God.

25:38.404 --> 25:40.439
There was a volunteer who
worked here and now he's dead.

25:40.539 --> 25:41.974
He died volunteering here?

25:42.074 --> 25:44.410
Oh, no, no. He was killed
in a lab explosion.

25:44.510 --> 25:45.745
It was terrible.

25:45.845 --> 25:47.346
Wait, I did
know him.
(gasps)

25:47.446 --> 25:49.048
Oh, my God, that's so sad.

25:49.148 --> 25:50.516
Yes.

25:50.617 --> 25:51.884
He was an amazing scientist.

25:51.984 --> 25:54.086
But I think lately
he was really unhappy.

25:56.022 --> 25:56.923
Why?

25:57.023 --> 25:58.190
That's all I know.

25:59.125 --> 26:01.193
Sorry, Allison's mom,
I need to sleep.

26:01.293 --> 26:02.228
Okay.

26:02.328 --> 26:04.096
Britney says she knew him.

26:04.196 --> 26:06.699
Oh, ask her if she knows
why he was unhappy.

26:06.799 --> 26:08.601
(phone chimes twice)

26:08.701 --> 26:13.405
Yeah, she thinks Nicholas didn't
trust his research partner.
Carrington.

26:13.505 --> 26:14.841
Okay.

26:14.941 --> 26:17.543
She said they were
in some big dispute.

26:17.644 --> 26:20.012
Well, honey, wait,
anything else?

26:20.112 --> 26:21.213
No, that's it.

26:21.313 --> 26:22.581
I really have to go
back to sleep.

26:22.682 --> 26:24.583
I have heart surgery
in three hours.

26:24.684 --> 26:26.352
You're having heart surgery
in three hours?

26:26.452 --> 26:27.954
That can't be right.

26:28.054 --> 26:31.223
She is performing heart surgery
in three hours.

26:31.323 --> 26:33.860
Oh.
ALLISON: You have
all your information.

26:33.960 --> 26:35.294
Now please go.

26:35.394 --> 26:36.996
Good night, Mother.

26:37.096 --> 26:38.364
Yes, yes, good night.

26:38.464 --> 26:40.166
Good night. Good night.

26:40.266 --> 26:42.669
Good... Oh, Allison, good night.

26:42.769 --> 26:44.003
(groans)
Good night.
Sweet dreams.

26:44.103 --> 26:46.873
I just need to call Todd.

26:46.973 --> 26:49.508
Mom, get out now.
Ooh, ooh.

26:49.608 --> 26:51.878
Sorry. I just...

26:52.879 --> 26:55.882
I'm sorry, I just need
to find my purse, okay?

26:55.982 --> 26:58.785
(all groaning)
It's okay, I just--
Ah, there it is.

27:00.586 --> 27:02.021
There. So sorry.

27:02.121 --> 27:03.389
Sorry.

27:03.489 --> 27:05.024
Okay, I got it.

27:05.124 --> 27:06.292
Keep the phone up.

27:06.392 --> 27:07.927
(deep breath)

27:08.027 --> 27:10.129
Todd, period, this is your mom,

27:10.229 --> 27:12.131
comma, listen,
there is something fishy

27:12.231 --> 27:14.867
going on with Nicholas and
Carrington, exclamation point.

27:14.967 --> 27:17.403
And I need you to double-check
your alibi, exclamation point.

27:17.503 --> 27:18.738
Go.

27:19.305 --> 27:21.874
Mom!

27:21.974 --> 27:23.209
Mom!

27:23.309 --> 27:27.113
Yes, I got your text
and your five voice mails

27:27.213 --> 27:29.749
and I'm checking out
his alibi right now.

27:33.485 --> 27:34.987
Huh.

27:37.857 --> 27:39.926
(Todd fake sneezing)

27:40.026 --> 27:41.060
Hi.

27:41.160 --> 27:42.594
Hi, I was just here,

27:42.695 --> 27:44.964
in this, uh, seminar--
fantastic, by the way--

27:45.064 --> 27:46.966
and I think I left my wallet...

27:47.066 --> 27:48.267
right here.
Do you mind?

27:48.367 --> 27:50.870
No, be my guest.

27:53.205 --> 27:54.173
You were just in here.

27:54.273 --> 27:57.243
Yeah. Why?

27:57.343 --> 27:58.644
Sorry, you just...

27:58.745 --> 28:00.112
You don't seem like a guy
who would be at a...

28:00.212 --> 28:02.715
pet psychic symposium.

28:04.316 --> 28:06.753
Well, you know what they say
in the pet psychic universe:

28:06.853 --> 28:07.987
"Never judge a dog by

28:08.087 --> 28:09.756
the shape of his
aura karma vector."

28:09.856 --> 28:11.991
Hi, I'm Balthazar
Constantine.

28:12.091 --> 28:14.060
But you could just call me Baz.

28:14.160 --> 28:16.095
Bethany.
Bethany.

28:16.195 --> 28:17.930
So, do you, uh...

28:18.030 --> 28:20.132
do all
the AV stuff here, Bethany?

28:20.232 --> 28:21.367
Sure do, Baz.

28:21.467 --> 28:23.169
And, uh, were you here
last Saturday?

28:23.269 --> 28:25.872
Plastics panel.
Kind of a science-y thing.

28:25.972 --> 28:27.974
There was this expert speaker,

28:28.074 --> 28:30.009
dirty blond slick hair,
Ed Norton vibes?

28:30.109 --> 28:34.246
Oh, yeah, I remember him.
Carrington Ponce.

28:34.346 --> 28:35.481
Carrington Ponce.

28:35.581 --> 28:37.083
Ugh. Came on really strong.

28:37.183 --> 28:38.650
Just, like,
hitting on me all night.

28:38.751 --> 28:40.119
And he won't stop texting me.

28:40.219 --> 28:41.687
Huh.
Here.

28:41.788 --> 28:44.523
You can... look.

28:44.623 --> 28:45.858
Okay.

28:45.958 --> 28:46.859
Wow.

28:46.959 --> 28:48.560
Mm.
That's a lot of texts.

28:48.660 --> 28:49.762
Yeah, he keeps
asking me for drinks.

28:49.862 --> 28:51.663
Like, a lot. (laughs)

28:52.664 --> 28:55.968
Wait. He was hitting on you?
This guy?

28:57.136 --> 28:58.004
Yeah.

28:58.104 --> 28:59.839
Is that so hard to believe?

28:59.939 --> 29:03.309
No. No, no, I mean, no, of
course. You're... wonderful.

29:03.409 --> 29:05.244
(laughs)
Um, but...

29:05.344 --> 29:07.513
Could you possibly text me

29:07.613 --> 29:09.615
a screenshot of
all of his messages?

29:10.582 --> 29:12.885
Uh... yeah, I mean, I guess.

29:12.985 --> 29:15.621
Just put your number
in my phone.

29:16.555 --> 29:17.656
Okay, sure.

29:18.457 --> 29:20.559
What's this for, anyway?
Why are you asking about him?

29:20.659 --> 29:22.761
Oh, uh... Stored.

29:22.862 --> 29:24.797
Well, I am a psychic.

29:24.897 --> 29:27.967
And I had this vision about him.

29:28.067 --> 29:29.535
You did go out for that drink

29:29.635 --> 29:30.669
and eventually
you got married.

29:30.769 --> 29:32.104
And then one day,

29:32.204 --> 29:33.539
you adopted a pet.

29:33.639 --> 29:35.774
And that pet would...

29:36.608 --> 29:39.178
...kill... you both.

29:40.346 --> 29:41.247
Are you serious?

29:41.347 --> 29:42.681
I am very serious.

29:42.781 --> 29:44.583
What kind of pet?

29:44.683 --> 29:47.153
It's a bird, a very big bird.

29:47.253 --> 29:49.255
And that is
why I'm here.

29:49.355 --> 29:51.457
To warn you away from him.

29:51.557 --> 29:53.225
And my work is now done.
(laughs)

29:53.325 --> 29:55.995
Thank you.
Pet blessings upon you.

29:58.164 --> 29:59.631
Oh, and, uh,
don't forget to text me

29:59.731 --> 30:01.467
the screenshot
of those messages, okay?

30:01.567 --> 30:04.871
Just, um... For my pet records.

30:09.741 --> 30:11.210
Hey. Hi.

30:11.310 --> 30:13.145
Where's my mom?
She'll be back
in five minutes.

30:13.245 --> 30:14.713
Something about
sweet-and-sour sauce.

30:14.813 --> 30:16.448
Okay, great,
thanks-- Whoa.

30:16.548 --> 30:18.450
My chair.

30:18.550 --> 30:19.485
That's my chair.

30:19.585 --> 30:20.786
That's a long story.

30:20.887 --> 30:21.787
Okay, well, here's
the short version:

30:21.888 --> 30:22.955
You stole my chair.

30:23.055 --> 30:24.423
Todd, by the time
I got that chair

30:24.523 --> 30:25.557
back to Beverly Crest's office,

30:25.657 --> 30:27.059
her assistant had replaced it.

30:27.159 --> 30:29.461
So, now, there
are two of them.

30:29.561 --> 30:31.363
And instead of ratting you out
as the thief of the first chair,

30:31.463 --> 30:33.032
I just put it in my office

30:33.132 --> 30:34.533
and have been telling everyone
that I bought it for myself.

30:34.633 --> 30:36.235
With my own money.

30:36.335 --> 30:38.237
But that's not true. You are
benefitting from my plundering.

30:38.337 --> 30:42.108
Look. That chair is mine now.
And it is very comfortable.

30:42.208 --> 30:43.775
TODD: I know.
SUSAN: And I earned it.

30:43.876 --> 30:45.577
I returned stolen property,
I covered for you,

30:45.677 --> 30:49.348
and I've been sitting next to
the bathroom on a broken swivel

30:49.448 --> 30:51.750
for the last 18 months.

30:51.850 --> 30:53.385
And if you try and take
that chair away from me,

30:53.485 --> 30:56.688
I will tell your mother
where it really came from.

30:57.756 --> 30:59.058
You would rat me out like that?

30:59.158 --> 31:01.060
Oh, and you're just going
back to your office?

31:01.160 --> 31:02.761
Oh, okay, I see
what's going on here.

31:02.861 --> 31:04.463
Very, very mature.

31:04.563 --> 31:06.665
You're having an affair
with my chair.
Ah.

31:06.765 --> 31:08.367
You're having an achair.

31:09.335 --> 31:10.436
Really not fair.

31:11.837 --> 31:14.873
Mmm, mmm.
I hope you like kung pao.

31:14.974 --> 31:16.608
Thank you very much.
Wow, look.

31:16.708 --> 31:18.277
You might be
interested to know

31:18.377 --> 31:20.446
that I met with
the AV lady, Bethany,

31:20.546 --> 31:22.714
who saw Carrington speak
at the plastics panel.

31:22.814 --> 31:23.882
How is that interesting?

31:23.983 --> 31:26.418
Because Carrington

31:26.518 --> 31:28.120
asked Bethany out on a date.

31:28.220 --> 31:30.289
He mentioned a boyfriend when
we talked to him at the lab.

31:30.389 --> 31:32.524
Exactly.
Well, who cares? He's bisexual.

31:32.624 --> 31:34.593
His personal life has nothing
to do with our case.

31:34.693 --> 31:36.162
TODD:
Yes, but...

31:36.262 --> 31:37.463
he's a cheater

31:37.563 --> 31:38.530
and that says
a lot about his character.

31:38.630 --> 31:39.731
Hmm. While I don't condone

31:39.831 --> 31:40.967
cheating of any kind,

31:41.067 --> 31:42.901
I think the leap
from sexual indiscretion

31:43.002 --> 31:46.672
to domestic terrorism
is highly implausible. Lyle?

31:46.772 --> 31:48.474
My money's on Rafe.

31:48.574 --> 31:49.608
Oh, so you're a betting man now.

31:49.708 --> 31:51.610
Saffron took the key for him.

31:51.710 --> 31:53.812
He's traveled the globe
to take down a corporation.

31:53.912 --> 31:55.447
The simplest answer.
Yeah.

31:55.547 --> 31:56.848
Like, way too simple.

31:56.949 --> 31:58.117
Angie says she saw someone

31:58.217 --> 31:59.751
in the lab the night
of the explosion.

31:59.851 --> 32:01.053
And I think it was Rafe.

32:01.153 --> 32:03.689
I'm going to go to campus,
find him,

32:03.789 --> 32:05.124
see what I can learn.
Okay.

32:05.224 --> 32:08.127
Okay, well, then I am
going to find Carrington,

32:08.227 --> 32:10.096
the cheater,
with a sideways approach.

32:10.196 --> 32:12.564
And what exactly entails
a sideways approach?

32:12.664 --> 32:14.300
Oh, it's best not to
encourage him, Lyle.
TODD: Oh, I am so

32:14.400 --> 32:16.402
glad you asked.

32:16.502 --> 32:18.570
It is a little
something called...

32:18.670 --> 32:19.905
Fakenphony.

32:20.006 --> 32:21.173
MARGARET: Oh, great,
let's solve everything

32:21.273 --> 32:22.908
with cell phone apps.
What is it?

32:23.009 --> 32:25.777
Well, it is an app
where you can send texts

32:25.877 --> 32:28.814
from other people's numbers
and I am texting Carrington

32:28.914 --> 32:32.084
right now pretending
to be... Bethany.

32:32.184 --> 32:33.319
That should be illegal.

32:33.419 --> 32:34.853
Yeah, well, as of now,
it is not.

32:34.953 --> 32:36.788
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

32:36.888 --> 32:38.457
Well, if by stupid...

32:38.557 --> 32:40.526
you mean effective,

32:40.626 --> 32:41.860
then I agree.

32:42.694 --> 32:44.630
Rafe or Carrington.

32:44.730 --> 32:46.198
May the best man win.

32:46.298 --> 32:48.034
Hmm.

32:52.071 --> 32:55.007
TODD:
Ow. Ow. Ow. You're on me!

32:57.643 --> 32:59.445
Forgot your fortunes.

32:59.545 --> 33:01.580
* *

33:23.001 --> 33:24.270
Call "The Fool."

33:26.672 --> 33:28.207
(phone buzzing)

33:30.809 --> 33:32.211
Yeah, supervisor here.

33:32.311 --> 33:34.446
(scoffs) Looks like you've
been stood up. I won.

33:34.546 --> 33:36.748
What? What are you
talking about?

33:36.848 --> 33:39.985
I was heading to Rafe's dorm
on campus and look who I found.

33:53.332 --> 33:56.368
Uh, what the heck is this?

34:03.975 --> 34:07.913
"Luck will smile
upon you. Twice."

34:11.083 --> 34:12.484
In bed.

34:12.584 --> 34:14.286
(laughs)

34:15.487 --> 34:16.955
(phone chimes)

34:30.068 --> 34:31.370
Twins.
Twins. Twins.
See? I won.

34:31.470 --> 34:32.504
I was right. But
more importantly,

34:32.604 --> 34:33.739
you were wrong.
Was I, though?

34:33.839 --> 34:34.606
You couldn't have
known that Carrington

34:34.706 --> 34:35.741
had a twin without me.

34:35.841 --> 34:37.476
Good point, Lyle.
It's a tie.

34:37.576 --> 34:39.010
You're both my best men.

34:39.111 --> 34:40.146
Whatever.

34:40.246 --> 34:41.647
I just can't believe
he has a twin.

34:41.747 --> 34:43.182
Which is how he was able
to be at the plastics panel

34:43.282 --> 34:44.816
and still blow up the lab.
There's two of him.

34:44.916 --> 34:46.318
Yeah, it's like
Lindsay Lohan

34:46.418 --> 34:47.686
and her sister in that
Parent Trap movie.

34:47.786 --> 34:49.355
But why would he
blow up his own lab,

34:49.455 --> 34:50.356
his own partner?

34:50.456 --> 34:52.023
Exactly, Lyle.

34:52.124 --> 34:53.125
What's his motive?

34:53.225 --> 34:54.626
Well, Mom, you
said Nicholas

34:54.726 --> 34:56.094
and Carrington
were in a dispute.

34:56.195 --> 34:57.596
So, what if it escalated

34:57.696 --> 34:59.198
and Carrington took
matters into his own hands?

34:59.298 --> 35:00.466
Good, good.

35:00.566 --> 35:02.234
LYLE: And when
Angie was arrested,

35:02.334 --> 35:03.435
he decided to frame her.

35:03.535 --> 35:04.903
Good. Good.

35:05.003 --> 35:06.305
Nice teamwork.

35:06.405 --> 35:08.507
Now, do we know
the twins' names?

35:08.607 --> 35:10.376
No, we--
Yes, we do.

35:10.476 --> 35:12.644
I didn't have
time for that.

35:12.744 --> 35:14.313
Gene Tree Search lists

35:14.413 --> 35:15.381
a Colby Ponce

35:15.481 --> 35:16.915
with the same birthdate.

35:17.015 --> 35:18.517
What we don't know
is if he's involved.

35:18.617 --> 35:21.187
Okay, well,
either/or, either way,

35:21.287 --> 35:22.521
Thing 1 or Thing 2,

35:22.621 --> 35:24.190
one of these twins
is up to something.

35:25.424 --> 35:26.525
BOTH:
So, what do we do now?

35:26.625 --> 35:27.626
Oh, we said that
together because--

35:27.726 --> 35:28.927
There's two of
them, I know.

35:29.027 --> 35:30.462
I-I was gonna say
because teamwork.

35:30.562 --> 35:34.200
I think I know exactly
what to do now.

35:37.236 --> 35:38.204
Mr. Ponce?

35:38.304 --> 35:39.938
Mr. Colby Ponce?

35:40.038 --> 35:41.072
Um, yes, hello.

35:41.173 --> 35:42.841
Hello, hello. I am
Theodore Schell.

35:42.941 --> 35:45.444
I'm a junior associate here
at Crest, Folding and Song.

35:45.544 --> 35:46.912
I am so glad...

35:47.012 --> 35:48.580
Hey, Derek.
...that we tracked you down.

35:48.680 --> 35:49.615
Please,
right this way.

35:49.715 --> 35:51.049
This is so strange.

35:51.149 --> 35:53.051
I didn't even know
my identity had been stolen.

35:53.151 --> 35:54.853
Well, identity theft
is very common.

35:54.953 --> 35:56.922
Hey, Cathy.
Our paralegal here.

35:57.022 --> 35:59.325
Uh, but, you know, most
people don't even know about it

35:59.425 --> 36:00.692
before it's too late.

36:00.792 --> 36:03.795
And, uh, turns out
some pesky hackers

36:03.895 --> 36:06.198
got into the Oregon DMV
files and went berserk.

36:06.298 --> 36:08.500
So, the DMV hired us
to pay restitution

36:08.600 --> 36:09.801
to everyone who suffered.

36:09.901 --> 36:11.370
And I'm sure the
$800 settlement

36:11.470 --> 36:13.705
won't go unwelcome in
your checking account, right?

36:13.805 --> 36:16.975
(laughs) Please,
right in here...

36:18.444 --> 36:19.345
Wow.

36:19.445 --> 36:21.747
What a lovely
chair, huh?

36:23.014 --> 36:24.683
There are just a few
forms for you to sign

36:24.783 --> 36:26.718
and you'll be on your
way, with your check.

36:26.818 --> 36:27.853
Please, have a seat.

36:27.953 --> 36:29.588
(elevator bell dings)
Ah.

36:29.688 --> 36:31.923
Carrington Ponce.

36:32.023 --> 36:34.192
Margaret Wright,
Angie Brooks' attorney.

36:34.293 --> 36:37.062
I am so sorry to interrupt
your day like this.

36:37.162 --> 36:39.865
So you said on the phone
she's taking a plea deal?

36:39.965 --> 36:41.099
We're preparing
it right now.

36:41.199 --> 36:43.101
The evidence against
her is overwhelming.

36:43.201 --> 36:45.537
But despite my personal
feelings about her innocence,

36:45.637 --> 36:46.872
we are pleading out.

36:46.972 --> 36:49.375
And part of the deal
is paying restitution

36:49.475 --> 36:50.842
for lab damages,

36:50.942 --> 36:53.879
so we have a list for
you to review and sign.

36:55.581 --> 36:57.949
And then you can
be on your way.

37:01.219 --> 37:03.088
This is gonna
take forever.

37:03.188 --> 37:04.990
I know. I'm sorry.

37:05.090 --> 37:06.325
The DMV can be

37:06.425 --> 37:07.926
very thorough.

37:08.026 --> 37:09.060
Donut?

37:09.160 --> 37:11.162
Oh, yes, please.
Thank you.

37:11.263 --> 37:12.398
Sure. Here you go.

37:12.498 --> 37:14.165
Okay. Wonderful.

37:14.266 --> 37:16.134
Oh, you have a very beautiful
signature. I like that.

37:16.234 --> 37:17.836
Make sure you get
the blue, blue-green,

37:17.936 --> 37:20.105
and then we'll circle back
for the reds and the yellows.

37:20.205 --> 37:21.139
That's right.

37:21.239 --> 37:22.908
And initial there.

37:23.008 --> 37:24.410
Mm-hmm.

37:24.510 --> 37:27.313
I mean, it's just your
boilerplate restitution deal.

37:27.413 --> 37:30.282
It has, uh, compensation
for all material costs,

37:30.382 --> 37:31.983
lab gear, everything.

37:32.083 --> 37:34.219
Well, I'm not signing anything
before I show it to my lawyer.

37:34.320 --> 37:36.355
Of course. I understand.

37:36.455 --> 37:37.756
I mean, as an attorney,

37:37.856 --> 37:39.991
that would've been
my exact advice to you.

37:45.764 --> 37:47.065
Donut?

37:48.133 --> 37:49.368
Thank you.

37:49.468 --> 37:51.437
As someone who cares
about the environment,

37:51.537 --> 37:54.306
I am so incredibly grateful

37:54.406 --> 37:57.108
for all of your
cutting-edge work on plastics.

37:57.208 --> 37:59.945
Thank you.
It was worth the sacrifice.

38:00.045 --> 38:02.881
Do you realize that you and
Nicholas are credited with

38:02.981 --> 38:06.217
solving a big part of
the world's plastics problems?

38:06.318 --> 38:08.320
Come on.
I mean...

38:08.420 --> 38:09.655
is it going to be hard
for you to be able to do it

38:09.755 --> 38:11.089
on your own now?

38:11.189 --> 38:12.791
No. I mean... (laughs)
Nicholas didn't really

38:12.891 --> 38:14.360
have an idea
of what we were doing.

38:14.460 --> 38:16.628
But we figured out how
to dissolve plastics.

38:16.728 --> 38:17.796
I bet that's worth
a lot of money.

38:17.896 --> 38:20.198
(laughing):
It's a gold mine.

38:20.298 --> 38:21.467
Oh...
I mean...

38:21.567 --> 38:22.634
And he just wanted
to give it all way.

38:22.734 --> 38:24.235
For free.
Give it away?

38:24.336 --> 38:26.472
To-to help the planet.
Oh, my gosh.

38:26.572 --> 38:27.639
I mean, that could be billions.

38:27.739 --> 38:30.809
Billions. It's... (laughs)

38:30.909 --> 38:32.944
It could be billions...

38:33.044 --> 38:34.279
and so you killed him.

38:45.624 --> 38:47.192
I'm not signing that.

38:48.794 --> 38:49.761
I am out of here.

38:49.861 --> 38:51.162
Carrington...

38:51.262 --> 38:53.399
you're already
signing it.

38:53.499 --> 38:54.733
That is you.

38:54.833 --> 38:56.702
Isn't it?
TODD:
Fantastic.

38:56.802 --> 38:58.236
He showed up
half an hour ago,

38:58.336 --> 38:59.871
said his name
was Carrington,

38:59.971 --> 39:02.408
said he'd be more than happy
to sign your confession.

39:02.508 --> 39:04.476
Colby...

39:04.576 --> 39:05.677
Stop!

39:05.777 --> 39:07.212
Colby, stop!

39:07.312 --> 39:09.147
Stop, don't sign.
Carry, what are
you doing here?

39:09.247 --> 39:10.616
This is a scam.
We got to go.

39:10.716 --> 39:12.418
Hold on a sec.
Take a look at this.

39:19.458 --> 39:20.526
What are these?

39:20.626 --> 39:21.460
It's not what
it looks like.

39:21.560 --> 39:22.528
TODD:
These are photos

39:22.628 --> 39:24.029
of what your brother did

39:24.129 --> 39:25.030
with the bomb he planted
while you were posing as him

39:25.130 --> 39:26.264
at the plastics panel.

39:26.364 --> 39:27.599
MARGARET:
That's Nicholas Armstrong,

39:27.699 --> 39:28.900
your brother's
partner.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.537
Horrifically burned,
eventually died.

39:31.637 --> 39:32.838
And that is on you.

39:32.938 --> 39:34.840
It's not true.
How could you do this?

39:34.940 --> 39:37.208
I didn't do it,
they're lying to you.

39:37.308 --> 39:38.844
It's Nicholas?

39:38.944 --> 39:40.879
It's not true, I'll explain,
but we have to go.

39:40.979 --> 39:42.614
No, I'm not doing this
for you anymore.

39:42.714 --> 39:44.550
Colby, you have to
listen, trust me.
No, no, no, no.

39:44.650 --> 39:47.052
No, he said he had the flu and
couldn't get out of the panel.

39:47.152 --> 39:49.254
You said you were sick!
Colby, shut up

39:49.354 --> 39:50.989
and stop talking, let's go.
No, enough, I'm not going!

39:51.089 --> 39:52.824
Come on!
No, I'm not going
to prison for him!

39:52.924 --> 39:54.125
He did this, not me.

39:54.225 --> 39:55.827
Oh, great, and I got that
all recorded.

39:55.927 --> 39:57.162
Let's just play that back...

39:57.262 --> 39:58.864
No, I'm not going
to prison for him.

39:58.964 --> 40:00.899
He did this, not me.

40:00.999 --> 40:04.135
And we'll need a signed,
legal confession, please.

40:04.235 --> 40:05.437
I'll sign anything you want.

40:05.537 --> 40:07.973
Colby!
I had nothing
to do with this.

40:10.341 --> 40:11.443
Ma!

40:12.744 --> 40:13.645
MARGARET:
Wait!

40:13.745 --> 40:15.581
TODD:
Hey, hey, hey!

40:15.681 --> 40:17.315
Hey.

40:20.118 --> 40:21.953
Told you to leave
my niece alone.

40:22.053 --> 40:24.890
Wow.
Double-O Lyle.

40:28.326 --> 40:30.228
OFFICER:
Come with us, sir.

40:30.328 --> 40:33.131
* *

40:35.867 --> 40:38.003
You did the right thing.

40:38.103 --> 40:41.973
So. This environmental
activism thing

40:42.073 --> 40:45.711
seems like it might be more
than just a hobby for you.

40:45.811 --> 40:48.046
Yeah, I think so.

40:48.146 --> 40:50.315
But maybe not on
the disrupter side.

40:50.415 --> 40:51.850
It's too volatile.

40:51.950 --> 40:54.520
That is an accurate
description.

40:54.620 --> 40:58.890
I was thinking maybe
like environmental law?

40:58.990 --> 41:01.292
Fighting the system
from within the system?

41:02.360 --> 41:04.462
Your mother is going
to like the sound of this.

41:04.563 --> 41:05.864
* Ooh, my, my... *

41:05.964 --> 41:08.033
I could be a badass
lawyer like Margaret.

41:08.133 --> 41:10.068
That's also accurate.

41:11.169 --> 41:13.772
Hey, Uncle Lyle?
Hmm?

41:13.872 --> 41:15.841
Thanks.

41:15.941 --> 41:18.176
* Gotta get up *

41:18.276 --> 41:21.079
* 'Cause you let me move... *

41:21.179 --> 41:23.214
(both laughing)

41:23.314 --> 41:26.117
* For things you let me do *
Love you. Thank you.

41:26.217 --> 41:27.485
* Gotta get up... *

41:27.586 --> 41:29.521
Good night, ladies.

41:30.889 --> 41:32.624
Is that
a partner donut?

41:32.724 --> 41:33.792
What? It's Colby's.

41:33.892 --> 41:35.226
And I worked
hard to get this.

41:35.326 --> 41:37.529
I set up that whole sting
with the Winklevoss twins.

41:37.629 --> 41:39.998
Oh, I set that up.
Thank you very much.

41:40.098 --> 41:41.833
Good night, ladies.
Well...

41:41.933 --> 41:43.201
I've been working overtime.

41:43.301 --> 41:45.571
Overtime is not seven
hours a day, Todd.

41:45.671 --> 41:48.139
Either way, I've been
down in the file room...

41:48.239 --> 41:51.276
Bob, see what a
little water can do?
Mm-hmm.

41:51.376 --> 41:53.044
...logging your
closed case files

41:53.144 --> 41:55.981
and making accurate records
of my hours.

41:56.081 --> 41:57.749
You've been doing all that?

41:57.849 --> 41:59.250
Yes, yes, I have.

41:59.350 --> 42:01.920
And I have 1,764 hours.

42:02.020 --> 42:03.589
1,764 hours?

42:03.689 --> 42:05.757
Left until I get
my license back.

42:05.857 --> 42:07.125
But I will get there.

42:07.225 --> 42:09.127
Legally.
Promise, Mom.

42:09.227 --> 42:13.498
Well, Todd, I think that
does merit a real reward.

42:13.599 --> 42:15.133
Wait, like another donut?

42:15.233 --> 42:16.167
Oh, no, no, no.
Like a fresh one?

42:16.267 --> 42:17.569
Oh, no, no, no, no.

42:17.669 --> 42:19.638
Lyle, Susan and I got you
a little something.

42:19.738 --> 42:21.573
Go straight to your office.

42:21.673 --> 42:22.774
Do not pass "Go."

42:22.874 --> 42:25.443
* My, my,
I want to feel... *

42:25.543 --> 42:26.945
'Kay.

42:30.148 --> 42:32.283
* Gotta get up *

42:32.383 --> 42:34.720
* 'Cause you let me move *

42:34.820 --> 42:37.255
* Gotta get up *

42:37.355 --> 42:40.158
* For things you let me do *
(sighs)

42:40.258 --> 42:42.027
* Gotta get up *

42:42.127 --> 42:44.362
* I'm alive, I'm alive *

42:44.462 --> 42:46.264
* Shake it,
shake it, shake it *

42:46.364 --> 42:48.266
* 'Cause I'm feelin' so fine. *
