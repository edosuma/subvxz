It's like I'm
supercharged or something.

00:26.202 --> 00:28.402
<i>Aah!</i>

00:28.470 --> 00:30.704
That's never happened before.

00:30.771 --> 00:33.323
I am St. Walker, and I believe I am

00:33.324 --> 00:35.875
the first Blue Lantern in the Universe.

00:41.844 --> 00:44.245
Take a deep breath.

00:44.312 --> 00:47.446
Focus on the calmness of the lake.

00:47.514 --> 00:51.281
Clear your mind of all emotions.

01:02.615 --> 01:03.946
You blood-sucking gnat.

01:04.013 --> 01:05.846
I'll stomp you into the ground.

01:07.182 --> 01:10.252
Razer, you have to be
willing to live with nature,

01:10.320 --> 01:12.221
no matter how small.

01:12.288 --> 01:14.122
Easy for you to say, brother Warth.

01:14.190 --> 01:17.693
Try again.
And concentrate on hope.

01:17.761 --> 01:20.361
- Hope for what?
- Hope for the future.

01:20.429 --> 01:24.699
Hope for peace.
Hope for love.

01:24.767 --> 01:27.569
[rumbling]

01:27.637 --> 01:29.237
Whoa!

01:29.305 --> 01:31.838
[roars]

01:33.673 --> 01:38.040
I can't use my powers while
I'm near your Blue rings.

01:45.013 --> 01:46.580
Aah!

01:46.647 --> 01:50.150
Uhh!

01:50.218 --> 01:53.386
[growls]

01:53.453 --> 01:55.621
[harp plays]

02:03.495 --> 02:07.063
So you're the one digging
all the tunnels and caves here.

02:07.130 --> 02:10.465
Be careful. That thing
just tried to kill me.

02:10.532 --> 02:13.302
More likely, he was
trying to play with you.

02:14.701 --> 02:17.135
You judge too quickly, Razer.

02:17.203 --> 02:20.905
Everyone and everything deserves love.

02:24.209 --> 02:28.411
Says the man playing
fetch with a giant worm.

02:30.247 --> 02:32.248
Aya.

02:39.355 --> 02:41.723
Jordan, what's with the pit stop?

02:41.790 --> 02:44.791
Shouldn't we be taking care of
our little Manhunter situation?

02:44.859 --> 02:47.793
I know, I know,
but there's an old friend here

02:47.861 --> 02:50.195
that can seriously
help out on our mission.

02:53.065 --> 02:54.932
Ganthet?

02:55.000 --> 02:57.201
Nice duds.

02:57.269 --> 03:00.537
So this is where you came after
the Guardians kicked you off of Oa.

03:00.605 --> 03:03.840
Yes. I realized that
there's another path

03:03.907 --> 03:05.941
by which I might serve the universe.

03:06.009 --> 03:09.711
I came to Odym to start
the Blue Lantern corps.

03:09.778 --> 03:12.145
This is St. Walker.

03:12.213 --> 03:15.848
Moonface! Ha ha!
Good to see you again, buddy.

03:15.916 --> 03:18.017
This is the guy I was telling you about.

03:18.085 --> 03:21.220
The one that helped me defeat
the Red Lantern armada, remember?

03:21.288 --> 03:23.455
How can I forget?

03:23.523 --> 03:27.424
And this is our second
Blue Lantern, brother Warth.

03:35.398 --> 03:38.833
Razer, this was not on my
list of probable locations

03:38.901 --> 03:40.435
of where you had gone.

03:40.502 --> 03:43.637
I didn't exactly have
a plan in mind when I left.

03:43.705 --> 03:47.474
So this is where you ran off to.
Who would have thought?

03:47.542 --> 03:51.712
It's pleasant to see you all.
Even you.

03:51.779 --> 03:53.413
Looks like Razer.

03:53.481 --> 03:56.316
[sniffs]
Definitely smells like Razer.

03:56.383 --> 03:58.384
But you ain't acting like Razer.

03:58.452 --> 04:00.752
What have you done with the angry guy?

04:00.820 --> 04:02.254
Hopefully destroyed him.

04:02.321 --> 04:05.423
The old Razer was
responsible for great evil.

04:05.491 --> 04:08.860
I came to Odym to ask the
Blue Lanterns for help.

04:08.927 --> 04:12.663
Since their power negates my own,
I thought this would be a good

04:12.664 --> 04:17.266
place to become someone else,
someone less angry.

04:17.334 --> 04:20.603
That's great, kid.
And it's good to see you.

04:20.670 --> 04:22.036
So, Hal Jordan,

04:22.105 --> 04:25.874
what was this matter of
business you wish to discuss?

04:25.941 --> 04:29.177
We have a problem I was hoping
you could shed some light on.

04:29.245 --> 04:32.813
We were ambushed near Zeta Prime
by, like, two dozen of these guys.

04:32.881 --> 04:35.916
They're popping up like
weeds all over Guardian space.

04:35.984 --> 04:39.386
These things are tough, but
luckily Kilowog's hammer's tougher.

04:39.454 --> 04:42.256
Any job worth doing
is worth doing right.

04:42.323 --> 04:45.458
Why did you not take
this to the council?

04:45.526 --> 04:48.395
To be honest, Ganthet,
you're the only Guardian I trust

04:48.462 --> 04:50.530
after what they tried to do to Aya.

04:50.598 --> 04:51.998
I'm hoping you might be able to help us

04:52.066 --> 04:54.034
find an Achilles' heel for these things.

04:54.101 --> 04:58.237
We designed the Manhunters
to be virtually invulnerable,

04:58.305 --> 05:01.107
but you did well to salvage this one.

05:01.175 --> 05:03.244
Perhaps with a thorough examination,

05:03.312 --> 05:06.747
I can pinpoint additional
defensive flaws.

05:06.815 --> 05:10.850
But first, there is something
I'd like to show you.

05:18.958 --> 05:20.525
Wow.

05:24.629 --> 05:26.496
You've come at an opportune time,

05:26.563 --> 05:30.900
as this is the day the battery
becomes fully operational.

05:30.968 --> 05:33.937
<i>In fearful day, in raging night,</i>

05:34.005 --> 05:36.973
<i>with strong hearts
full, our souls ignite.</i>

05:37.041 --> 05:39.909
<i>When all seems lost
in the war of light,</i>

05:39.977 --> 05:44.246
<i>look to the stars,
for hope burns bright.</i>

06:04.265 --> 06:07.300
My higher functions are now
operating at optimal levels.

06:07.368 --> 06:09.302
Just like the Maelstrom battle.

06:09.369 --> 06:12.539
My ring isn't just
charged, it's supercharged.

06:12.607 --> 06:14.708
This is exactly
what we're looking for.

06:14.776 --> 06:16.377
With the Blue Lanterns on our side,

06:16.444 --> 06:19.779
we can get rid of this
Manhunter mess pronto.

06:21.348 --> 06:23.749
[all grunt]

06:29.388 --> 06:32.724
<i>No man escapes the Manhunters.</i>

07:02.481 --> 07:04.548
That ain't no normal Manhunter. 

07:04.616 --> 07:07.918
Yeah, but we ain't no
normal Green Lanterns.

07:11.989 --> 07:15.191
<i>No man escapes the Manhunters.</i>

07:15.258 --> 07:19.594
Yeah? How about you
shut your talkhole?

07:27.469 --> 07:32.339
You know what, I'm getting
real tired of these things.

07:40.079 --> 07:42.714
How could this have happened?

07:42.782 --> 07:44.816
The Blue energy from
the central battery

07:44.883 --> 07:48.118
must have supercharged its
ability to repair itself.

07:48.186 --> 07:50.988
That could be a good thing.
Now we can interrogate it.

07:51.055 --> 07:52.989
You want to interrogate a machine?

07:53.057 --> 07:56.025
Good luck conversing with
wires and scrap metal.

08:02.799 --> 08:06.134
<i>I have placed this Manhunter
in remedial query mode.</i>

08:06.201 --> 08:07.768
<i>You may ask him questions.</i>

08:07.836 --> 08:09.704
<i>All right. I'll go firSt.</i>

08:09.771 --> 08:12.873
What is your problem?

08:12.940 --> 08:16.376
<i>Primary objective is to
eradicate evil from the Universe.</i>

08:16.443 --> 08:20.346
Try looking in the mirror,
you trigger-happy bucket of bolts.

08:20.414 --> 08:21.914
<i>Please restate.</i>

08:21.981 --> 08:24.315
How do you determine what is evil?

08:24.383 --> 08:27.585
<i>Evil stems from emotion.
Therefore emotion is evil.</i>

08:27.653 --> 08:31.188
<i>All emotion and those that
protect emotion must be destroyed.</i>

08:31.256 --> 08:32.756
Nice logic.

08:32.823 --> 08:35.725
The Manhunters were designed
to police the Universe.

08:35.793 --> 08:37.227
But due to faulty programming,

08:37.294 --> 08:40.996
every emotional being
was deemed criminal.

08:41.063 --> 08:42.864
Is there some way to fix them?

08:42.932 --> 08:44.700
Maybe they can be taught
to tell the difference

08:44.767 --> 08:46.068
between right and wrong.

08:46.135 --> 08:49.104
That's impossible.
This thing isn't a living being.

08:49.171 --> 08:53.375
It's a robot. It's not able
to learn or grow or feel pain.

08:53.442 --> 08:56.511
- It doesn't have a soul.
- Is that your belief,

08:56.579 --> 08:59.013
that robots are not
beings worthy of respect?

08:59.080 --> 09:00.414
That we are without souls?

09:00.482 --> 09:03.350
Aya, I don't think
that's what he was saying.

09:04.853 --> 09:08.189
You're different, Aya.
I didn't mean...

09:09.457 --> 09:13.694
Your thought processes
are clear enough to me.

09:17.265 --> 09:19.600
Uhh, just our luck.

09:19.668 --> 09:21.568
We came here looking
for a Manhunter weakness

09:21.636 --> 09:25.372
and found a way to
make them even stronger.

09:25.439 --> 09:26.906
<i>Did you say it's some kind of root?</i>

09:26.974 --> 09:30.310
<i>I swear, it tastes
just like marshmallow.</i>

09:30.377 --> 09:32.545
[harp plays]

09:40.453 --> 09:44.690
Razer.
What burdens your mind?

09:45.825 --> 09:50.562
St. Walker, do you believe
robots can have souls?

09:53.565 --> 09:56.100
I believe we are
all robots of a sort.

09:56.167 --> 09:59.202
Each of us is programmed
in our own special way.

10:00.304 --> 10:03.772
But I do not believe this question
is the one you wish answered.

10:03.840 --> 10:05.674
And what might that be?

10:05.742 --> 10:10.478
Is it acceptable to love again
if your first and true love has died?

10:10.546 --> 10:12.747
I did not share
information about my past

10:12.814 --> 10:14.982
so you could throw it in my face.

10:15.049 --> 10:18.752
Besides, you presume
too much, St. Walker.

10:18.819 --> 10:21.487
Aya is a machine.
She cannot love.

10:21.555 --> 10:24.356
Whatever I feel for her is a lie.

10:24.424 --> 10:27.959
Razer, your life's journey has
been marred by despair and anger.

10:28.027 --> 10:29.661
Hope can help with that.

10:29.729 --> 10:33.864
Hope in a new path that will
lead you to love once again.

11:29.611 --> 11:33.480
<i>Query. Why did you retrieve
me from my captivity?</i>

11:33.548 --> 11:37.850
Kinship. You and I are
both artificial constructs.

11:37.918 --> 11:39.318
We are alike.

11:39.386 --> 11:41.319
<i>Then why are you not terminating</i>

11:41.387 --> 11:43.855
<i>the emotion-emitting
life forms on this planet?</i>

11:43.923 --> 11:45.590
Because I do not kill.

11:45.658 --> 11:49.493
<i>You do not kill. Your
programming has been corrupted.</i>

11:49.561 --> 11:52.029
It is not programming
that keeps me from killing.

11:52.096 --> 11:56.165
It is a decision I made after observing
the Green Lanterns I work with.

11:56.233 --> 11:58.767
<i>You accepted faulty data.</i>

11:58.835 --> 12:01.103
No, I learned from example.

12:01.170 --> 12:04.239
You, too, are capable of
evolving beyond your programming.

12:04.307 --> 12:06.073
I will teach you.

12:07.109 --> 12:09.943
<i>No man escapes the Manhunters.</i>

12:10.011 --> 12:13.746
Sigh.

12:19.185 --> 12:21.353
Aya?

12:22.688 --> 12:25.923
Aya?
Where are you?

12:37.968 --> 12:41.169
<i>No man escapes the Manhunters.</i>

12:44.006 --> 12:46.174

12:51.713 --> 12:54.381
<i>The Manhunter, it's gone.</i>

12:54.449 --> 12:57.250
Aya is, too.
I can't find her anywhere.

12:57.318 --> 13:00.119
We have bigger problems, brother.

13:12.237 --> 13:14.204
<i>Relinquish the device corresponding </i>

<i>Alternatives not permitted.

<i>Aah!</i>

15:04.635 --> 15:07.570
<i>Primary objective located.</i>

15:07.637 --> 15:09.438
Let us go over this again.

15:09.505 --> 15:11.740
If you find that your
programming is in error,

15:11.807 --> 15:14.642
you have the right to
amend that programming.

15:14.710 --> 15:19.112
<i>No error has been detected.
I will obey my programming.</i>

15:19.180 --> 15:20.680
Then you will never grow.

15:20.748 --> 15:23.015
You must learn to adapt and change

15:23.083 --> 15:25.451
if you wish to be a sentient life form.

15:25.519 --> 15:27.452
<i>Sentient is irrelevant.</i>

15:27.520 --> 15:30.854
<i>I was built to terminate
emotional life forms.</i>

15:33.024 --> 15:36.459
<i>No man escapes the Manhunters.</i>

15:36.527 --> 15:39.261
If you refuse to change,
then you are not an

15:39.262 --> 15:42.130
artificial intelligence,
but merely a machine.

15:42.198 --> 15:47.035
<i>You are also a machine.
We are both artificial constructs.</i>

15:47.103 --> 15:49.271
<i>We are the same.</i>

15:49.339 --> 15:51.673
<i>We are the same.</i>

15:51.740 --> 15:56.611
<i>[slow motion]
We are the same.</i>

15:56.678 --> 16:00.548
I am nothing like you.

16:14.594 --> 16:19.563
- Get that wall up, Kilowog.
- I'm doing the best I can.

16:21.767 --> 16:25.669
That battery's made them
unstoppable. You have to shut it off.

16:25.737 --> 16:27.471
The procedure takes several hours.

16:27.538 --> 16:31.207
By then, the battle will be lost.

16:44.752 --> 16:48.955
I have an idea.
But I'm going to need some help.

18:08.224 --> 18:11.459
Great job, guys.
Now let's clean up this mess.

[all grunting]

18:40.149 --> 18:43.250
Correct. Your primary

18:43.318 --> 18:45.786
But you as an artificial life form

18:45.853 --> 18:48.755

How is this possible?

19:15.380 --> 19:17.847
Razer's power cannot
function near our Blue rings.

19:17.915 --> 19:20.416
Aah!

19:22.753 --> 19:25.020
[grunting]

19:25.088 --> 19:26.889
It is his rage.

19:26.957 --> 19:30.059
Aah!

19:30.127 --> 19:32.694
It has grown too strong.

19:40.703 --> 19:41.969
Aya.

19:45.973 --> 19:48.274
Aya, are you all right?

19:51.645 --> 19:54.979
Yes.
I think so.

19:55.047 --> 19:57.915
I apologize for what I said earlier.

19:57.982 --> 20:01.484
You have more of a soul
than I have ever had.

20:03.219 --> 20:05.086
<i>I have extinguished the flame,</i>

20:05.154 --> 20:07.989
<i>allowing everyone's power
level to return to normal.</i>

20:08.057 --> 20:11.158
It will be some time
before I have enough energy

20:11.226 --> 20:13.527
to light the battery once again.

20:13.595 --> 20:15.829
Until this Manhunter
problem is solved,

20:15.897 --> 20:17.697
I think it would be
best if you kept it off.

20:17.765 --> 20:21.000
For now, you'll have
to put hope on hold.

20:21.068 --> 20:22.368
On hold?

20:22.436 --> 20:24.937
Whether this Lantern
burns or not, Hal Jordan,

20:25.005 --> 20:28.307
hope will always remain.

20:29.976 --> 20:32.143
[growling]

20:35.614 --> 20:38.281
You should stay and
continue your training, Razer.

20:38.349 --> 20:40.616
There is still much anger within you.

20:40.684 --> 20:42.918
There are many kinds of anger.

20:42.986 --> 20:46.455
In this case, I believe
my rage was righteous.

20:46.523 --> 20:50.692
You have helped me to realize
my path lies elsewhere.

20:52.195 --> 20:56.131
Get a move on, kid.
We've got Manhunter heads to bust.

20:56.199 --> 21:01.103
You will always have a place
here, Razer, if you choose it.

21:03.553 --> 21:07.506
