- She better stay away
from Daniel.

19:33.505 --> 19:35.090
He is mine.

19:37.175 --> 19:40.387
- So what do you want
to do tonight?

19:40.470 --> 19:44.308
- Oh, you know,
just the usual sleepover stuff.

19:44.391 --> 19:46.059
Boxing, 'cause...

19:47.352 --> 19:49.438
I--I mean, it's your house

19:49.521 --> 19:52.566
so you choose what we do first.

19:54.818 --> 19:56.820
Note to self:

19:56.904 --> 19:58.572
never let Emma choose

19:58.655 --> 20:00.449
our sleepover activities.

20:00.532 --> 20:01.867
- You know who came over today?

20:01.950 --> 20:04.119
- The glitter fairy?
- No.

20:04.202 --> 20:05.621
Maddie and her mom.

20:05.704 --> 20:07.998
- What did they want?
- I don't know.

20:08.081 --> 20:10.751
Maddie's mom kept asking me
these weird questions.

20:10.834 --> 20:12.586
Then they left in a rush.

20:12.669 --> 20:14.171
Where did I leave the brush?

20:16.882 --> 20:20.636
[both screaming]

20:23.221 --> 20:23.805
- [snoring]

20:23.889 --> 20:25.933
- Guys, focus.

20:26.016 --> 20:27.684
We have to focus.
[cell phone rings]

20:27.768 --> 20:31.063
- We can't focus with Maddie
texting you every five seconds.

20:31.146 --> 20:32.272
- Okay, I'll turn my phone off.

20:32.356 --> 20:33.523
Problem solved.

20:37.653 --> 20:38.362
[both gasping]

20:38.445 --> 20:39.988
- Okay, if something else moves,

20:40.072 --> 20:41.281
I swear I'm running home.

20:41.365 --> 20:42.824
- It's okay.
Just think happy thoughts.

20:42.908 --> 20:43.825
- Okay, okay.

20:43.909 --> 20:46.411
Uh, great white sharks,

20:46.495 --> 20:47.496
zombies,

20:47.579 --> 20:47.996
hockey games,

20:48.080 --> 20:49.748
my toolbox,

20:49.831 --> 20:50.874
more zombies--

20:50.958 --> 20:51.875
- Those are not happy thoughts.

20:51.959 --> 20:54.086
Think.
[chuckles]

20:54.169 --> 20:58.006
Glitter, balloons, SweeTARTS,

20:58.090 --> 21:00.217
rainbows, puppies,
and pink hearts.

21:00.300 --> 21:03.303
- Cute, you even did
a little rhyme there.

21:03.387 --> 21:04.346
[laughs]

21:04.429 --> 21:05.931
- [gasps]

21:06.014 --> 21:07.641
- Oh, what was that?

21:07.724 --> 21:09.518
- Oh, that's kind of nice.

21:09.601 --> 21:12.187
[both screaming]

21:12.270 --> 21:14.022
- What is this?

21:14.106 --> 21:16.483
What was that?

21:16.566 --> 21:17.734
- I'm not sure,

21:17.818 --> 21:19.319
but my great-grandmother

21:19.403 --> 21:23.657
used to tell me these stories
about...

21:23.740 --> 21:25.242
- About what?

21:25.325 --> 21:27.035
- Witches.

21:27.119 --> 21:28.245
- [laughs]

21:28.328 --> 21:29.204
Witches.

21:29.288 --> 21:30.831
And you believed her?

21:30.914 --> 21:33.375
- Do you have a better
explanation for any of this?

21:33.458 --> 21:33.917
- [scoffs]
Yes.

21:34.001 --> 21:34.960
[clears throat]

21:35.043 --> 21:37.546
There's a...

21:37.629 --> 21:39.589
and it's...

21:39.673 --> 21:41.758
and then that makes...

21:41.842 --> 21:43.969
voilà.

21:44.052 --> 21:46.888
- Oh, yeah, that makes
way more sense

21:46.972 --> 21:48.265
than what I said.

21:48.348 --> 21:50.892
Look, you wished
for all those hearts,

21:50.976 --> 21:52.227
and they appeared.

21:52.310 --> 21:55.105
Exactly how Grammy Gram
described.

21:55.188 --> 21:57.065
- Come on.
Do you really think I'm a...

21:57.149 --> 21:59.192
- Yep, you're a witch.
