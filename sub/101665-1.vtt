         (gentle music)

00:08.901 --> 00:12.344
        (crowd cheering)

00:12.496 --> 00:17.433
        (horn blaring)
    (dramatic dance music)

01:01.545 --> 01:04.396
        (crowd cheering)

01:09.478 --> 01:12.312
     (crickets chirping)
        (dog barking)

01:12.464 --> 01:14.907
         (pensive music)

01:20.989 --> 01:23.415
         (shots firing)

01:25.811 --> 01:27.477
         - [Audrey] Oh!

01:27.496 --> 01:28.995
    We gotta go, we gotta go!

01:29.148 --> 01:31.481
  - Don't do this, Audrey, go!

01:31.500 --> 01:32.240
        - Mom, wait!
        (shot firing)

01:32.259 --> 01:33.908
     (screams) Mom! No! No!

01:33.928 --> 01:34.909
       (Audrey screams)
         (shot firing)

01:34.929 --> 01:39.723
       (Audrey gasping)
       (dramatic music)

01:42.678 --> 01:46.605
         (shot firing)
        (Audrey gasps)

01:46.682 --> 01:51.610
       (pensive music)
     (crickets chirping)

01:57.693 --> 02:00.694
      (footsteps crunching)

02:01.530 --> 02:03.605
 You've seen this before, right?

02:03.624 --> 02:05.440
  Insignificant minor character

02:05.459 --> 02:07.534
       gets murdered in
      the opening scene?

02:08.294 --> 02:09.961
  And you're probably thinking,

02:10.038 --> 02:12.780
   why do they always do that?

02:13.783 --> 02:15.467
     I'm gonna let you in
      on a little secret.

02:15.619 --> 02:18.637
   They do this to make you
   want to watch the movie.

02:18.788 --> 02:19.555
           That's why.

02:21.291 --> 02:23.049
 Let me tell you something else.

02:23.202 --> 02:27.053
     Newsflash, I am not
    some minor character.

02:27.206 --> 02:28.272
        This is my story.

02:30.225 --> 02:31.650
 So, my name is Audrey Anderson

02:31.801 --> 02:33.485
     and while it appears
      that things may not

02:33.637 --> 02:36.046
    be looking too bright
      for me, trust me,

02:36.064 --> 02:37.656
 it hasn't always been this way.

02:37.733 --> 02:40.325
   At one point, everything
       was just peachy.

02:40.477 --> 02:42.886
     Let me take you back
       to the beginning.

02:42.905 --> 02:46.498
   This whole thing started
    about four months ago,

02:46.650 --> 02:48.458
     mainly because I was
       running way late.

02:49.653 --> 02:50.652
          Oh my God!
            - Whoa!

02:50.671 --> 02:51.670
  - I'm so sorry, are you okay?

02:51.821 --> 02:53.230
      - I'm okay, are you?

02:53.248 --> 02:54.506
         - I'm way late.

02:54.658 --> 02:55.899
    Do you know where the
Renegade workout facility is?

02:55.918 --> 02:56.842
   - Yeah, it's over that way.

02:56.993 --> 02:58.402
    Are you dancing tryouts?

02:58.420 --> 02:59.178
       - Right, thank you.

03:01.515 --> 03:03.015
 - Something about girl's night.

03:03.166 --> 03:08.103
     (dancers chattering)
        (upbeat music)

03:14.436 --> 03:16.695
   - Oh my God, he's so cute.

03:21.685 --> 03:23.184
       - Have you been
    waiting in line long?

03:23.204 --> 03:24.036
              - Me?

03:24.872 --> 03:26.763
     Maybe about 10 minutes.

03:26.765 --> 03:28.114
  Everybody else, maybe a hour.

03:28.267 --> 03:29.875
        - Oh, good, I
     thought I was late.

03:31.437 --> 03:33.270
    - You're definitely late,

03:33.272 --> 03:35.047
        and don't think
     coach didn't notice.

03:38.777 --> 03:40.794
  - [Dancer] Yo, Hakim, how
  'bout an autograph, huh?

03:40.946 --> 03:42.036
        (Hakim chuckles)

03:42.056 --> 03:43.722
- [Dancer] Oh, he's really cute.

03:45.634 --> 03:46.683
             Hi!
    - Lookin' good, baby.

03:48.211 --> 03:50.454
      - Yo, she's hot, bro.

03:50.456 --> 03:52.380
    - I'm Audrey by the way.

03:52.399 --> 03:53.640
            - Tracy.

03:53.792 --> 03:54.483
          - First time?

03:55.477 --> 03:57.903
      - No, unfortunately.

03:57.980 --> 03:59.571
 It's my second year tryin' out.

04:01.224 --> 04:03.408
   Swear to God, if I don't
   make the same this year,

04:03.560 --> 04:04.409
    I'm gonna kill somebody.

04:04.561 --> 04:06.636
       (Audrey laughs)
       (Tracy laughs)

04:06.655 --> 04:08.305
  - [Cassie] Welcome everyone.

04:08.323 --> 04:09.806
 Please turn in your head shots.

04:09.808 --> 04:11.733
Make sure that your contact info

04:11.752 --> 04:14.478
is correct and start warming up.

04:14.496 --> 04:15.812
   For those of you returning,

04:15.831 --> 04:18.589
    it's great to see you
  and it's wonderful seeing

04:18.666 --> 04:21.426
  all these new faces, too.
        - Excuse me.

04:21.503 --> 04:24.263
    - Excuse me, the line
      starts back here.

04:26.825 --> 04:27.657
        (Bailey chuckles)

04:27.659 --> 04:29.826
  Yo, who the hell do you think

04:29.845 --> 04:31.603
 you are cuttin' in front of us?

04:31.755 --> 04:33.272
     - Who do I think I am?

04:33.423 --> 04:34.106
         - [Tracy] Yes!

04:35.183 --> 04:36.775
       - I'm Bailey West.

04:36.926 --> 04:38.760
    I'm already on the team.

04:38.779 --> 04:41.021
     - You were on the team.

04:41.173 --> 04:44.449
         (Bailey sighs)

04:44.526 --> 04:45.784
       That was last year.

04:45.861 --> 04:49.179
    This year you audition
      like everyone else.

04:49.197 --> 04:50.789
   - What's the matter, Coach?

04:50.866 --> 04:51.623
          You worried?

04:52.942 --> 04:54.351
          - About what?

04:54.353 --> 04:55.961
       - That someday
     I'll have your job?

04:57.539 --> 04:59.548
   - Back of the line, Bailey.

05:02.694 --> 05:04.210
        (Cassie exhales)

05:04.363 --> 05:06.471
             - Bye.

05:06.623 --> 05:09.699
      (girls chattering)
        (gentle music)

05:09.701 --> 05:11.643
      - Ready for it, okay.

05:11.795 --> 05:13.053
           All right.

05:13.205 --> 05:15.963
      Thank you for being
     here today everyone.

05:15.983 --> 05:19.225
   Please stand up and get
  ready to form four lines.

05:19.378 --> 05:21.486
       We're gonna do
across-the-floor combination.

05:21.638 --> 05:23.655
         (upbeat music)

05:23.807 --> 05:25.732
    Five, six, seven, eight!

05:25.884 --> 05:28.051
     Step, step, Chaines
     turn, Chaines turn.

05:50.851 --> 05:51.683
          Seven, eight.

 Four, five, six, seven, eight.

   Good, here comes the hips.

    One, two, three, four
  and hip and hip, step up.

06:13.115 --> 06:14.706
   Good, now let's back it up.

06:16.025 --> 06:18.543
    This time we're doing
    it for real full out.

06:18.695 --> 06:19.436
     She really stands out.

06:19.454 --> 06:20.194
       I really like her.

06:20.214 --> 06:21.880
    Five, six, seven, eight.

06:23.884 --> 06:27.552
  Listen up, if you received
  a number, congratulations.

06:27.629 --> 06:29.613
 You are advancing to round two.

06:29.631 --> 06:32.449
If you didn't receive a number,
you're done for the day.

06:32.467 --> 06:33.283
      Thank you very much.

06:33.301 --> 06:34.951
       - I hate this part.

06:34.970 --> 06:35.727
        I really want it.

06:37.714 --> 06:38.955
   - [Audrey] Bailey got hers.

06:38.974 --> 06:40.232
       - [Judge] Congrats.

06:40.383 --> 06:41.066
          - She would.

06:41.217 --> 06:42.734
          - Of course.

06:42.886 --> 06:43.819
   - [Audrey] Here she comes.

06:44.980 --> 06:45.737
          - Good luck.

06:47.816 --> 06:49.056
  - Congratulations, great job.

06:49.076 --> 06:51.985
       - (laughs) Oh my
      God, I'm so happy!

06:52.137 --> 06:53.912
   - I guess that's it for me.

06:53.989 --> 06:55.580
         Good luck.
     - Nice meeting you.

06:55.657 --> 06:56.415
              Bye.

06:57.476 --> 06:58.417
         - Here you go.

06:58.493 --> 06:59.418
       - [Audrey] Really?

06:59.494 --> 07:00.810
       (Audrey squeals)
        (Tracy laughs)

07:00.829 --> 07:02.254
    - [Audrey and Tracy]
    Oh my God, oh my God!

07:02.405 --> 07:03.255

07:06.242 --> 07:07.426
      Focus, focus, focus.

07:07.502 --> 07:09.152
   - We are going to do the
     audition combination.

07:09.171 --> 07:11.821
     What we're looking
     for is your smiles.

07:11.840 --> 07:14.824
  We want you to project it
  to the nosebleed section.

07:14.843 --> 07:16.993
    They need to know how
   much fun you're having.

07:17.012 --> 07:18.920
    Show the audience that
  you're having a good time.

07:18.939 --> 07:19.996
         Are you ready?

07:19.998 --> 07:22.499
    Five, six, seven, eight.

   Punch, punch, punch, punch.

07:29.950 --> 07:32.200

07:52.197 --> 07:53.029
      Take it from the top.

07:53.048 --> 07:53.972
        New choreography.

07:54.123 --> 07:56.892

        Good job, right?

08:30.085 --> 08:30.842
              Woo!

08:31.920 --> 08:33.236
           Thank you.

08:33.255 --> 08:35.013
       Take five, we'll
       see you in five.

08:35.090 --> 08:37.182
      Up next we have on
      camera interviews,

08:37.332 --> 08:39.833
    so get ready, take a
   break, drink some water

08:39.852 --> 08:41.168
       and I'll see you
      back here in five.

08:41.188 --> 08:42.312
     - [Dancer] Hi, Walter.

08:43.582 --> 08:44.246
              - Hi.

08:44.265 --> 08:46.858
         (dancer laughs)

08:48.177 --> 08:50.845
 - Hey, you dropped your jersey.

08:50.864 --> 08:52.697
      - Oh, wow, thank you.

08:54.034 --> 08:54.866
        What's your name?

08:55.927 --> 08:56.609
          - I'm Audrey.

08:56.762 --> 08:58.094
        It's no problem.

08:58.096 --> 08:58.778
          - Hi, Audrey.

08:58.930 --> 09:00.096
             Walter.

09:00.098 --> 09:01.873
  - [Dancer] You're kidding me!

09:01.950 --> 09:03.433
   - Excuse me, I'm sorry, hi.

09:03.451 --> 09:04.434
            - Hi.
     - Walter, can I get

09:04.452 --> 09:05.268
       a picture with you?

09:05.287 --> 09:06.452
             - Sure.

09:06.605 --> 09:07.771
       - Here, let me.
      - I'm so excited.

09:07.789 --> 09:08.454
       (dancers laughing)

09:08.607 --> 09:09.773
            - Ready?

09:09.775 --> 09:11.716
       One, two, three.
      (shutter clicking)

09:11.868 --> 09:12.884
            Perfect.

09:13.036 --> 09:13.701
        - Is it cute?
    - There you go, yeah.

09:13.720 --> 09:14.127
    - Do I need another one?

09:14.279 --> 09:15.612
              Okay.

09:15.630 --> 09:16.446
         - Here, oo!
  - Very great to meet you.

09:16.448 --> 09:17.722
             - Oh.
         - Thank you.

09:17.799 --> 09:18.223
        - Thank you.
 - You were great last game.

09:18.374 --> 09:18.557
          - Thank you.

09:19.968 --> 09:20.967
        Do you want one?

09:21.119 --> 09:22.561
      - Oh, that's okay.
             - Hi.

09:22.637 --> 09:23.878
     - [Hakim] Hey, babe.
       (Bailey squeals)

09:23.897 --> 09:25.546
     - [Bailey] Oh my gosh!

09:25.566 --> 09:27.791
         (Bailey laughs)

09:27.793 --> 09:28.400
    - [Hakim] You look good.

09:28.551 --> 09:29.317
          - Excuse me.

09:31.054 --> 09:31.886
 - [Hakim] Hey, Walter's comin'.

09:31.905 --> 09:34.489
         (dancer laughs)

09:39.746 --> 09:41.228
    - Why are you doin' that?

09:41.248 --> 09:41.988
          - Doing what?

09:42.140 --> 09:42.897
        - You know what.

09:42.916 --> 09:44.583
     In front of everybody?

09:45.419 --> 09:46.751
            - Please.

09:46.903 --> 09:49.421
     - Can we talk for a
     second, in private?

09:49.572 --> 09:51.572
    - No, I'm a little busy.

09:51.592 --> 09:52.424
             Hello?

09:52.500 --> 09:53.650
And besides, we're done talking.

09:53.668 --> 09:54.834
         - Come on.
      - Don't touch me!

09:54.986 --> 09:55.594
        - Don't do that.

09:55.670 --> 09:56.577
       - Get away from me!

09:56.597 --> 09:59.264
         (pensive music)

10:01.417 --> 10:03.084
    - We're not done talking.

10:03.103 --> 10:04.327
     I'll be out in my car.

10:04.329 --> 10:09.024
        (pensive music)
     (dancers chattering)

10:10.110 --> 10:11.668
   - [Cassie] And we're back.

10:11.686 --> 10:14.003
         Give us your
    personalities, ladies.

10:14.022 --> 10:15.355
       - Hi, I'm Cynthia.

10:15.507 --> 10:16.114
         - I'm Tatiana.

10:16.265 --> 10:17.449
      - My name's Victoria.

10:17.525 --> 10:19.025
       - My name is Maria.

10:19.177 --> 10:19.784
         - I'm Patrice.

10:19.936 --> 10:20.844
           - I'm Gigi.

10:20.846 --> 10:21.953
    I'm from Miami, Florida.

10:22.105 --> 10:23.104
        - Dallas, Texas.

10:23.123 --> 10:23.955
        - San Francisco.

10:24.107 --> 10:25.515
     - Here in Los Angeles.

10:25.533 --> 10:26.607
            - Alaska.

10:26.627 --> 10:28.701
       - Kansas City,
    Kansas, not Missouri.

10:28.854 --> 10:30.186
        - Hi, I'm Tracy.

10:30.205 --> 10:32.188
    I'm originally from Utah.

10:32.207 --> 10:34.966
        I became really
   passionate about acting,

10:35.043 --> 10:37.043
       such an original
    concept for this town.

10:37.195 --> 10:39.362
       I've always been
       a Renegades fan.

10:39.381 --> 10:40.472
       Pick me (chuckles).

10:40.623 --> 10:42.532
        - Bailey here,
      raised in Seattle.

10:42.550 --> 10:44.142
       I was a Renegade
       Girl last season

10:44.219 --> 10:46.645
     and it was the most
 incredible year of my life.

10:46.721 --> 10:51.057
And I can say from experience
  that Cassie is hands down

10:51.209 --> 10:52.817
        the best dance
     coach I've ever had,

10:54.212 --> 10:56.279
 and I hope I get the chance
   to work with her again.

10:59.734 --> 11:02.051
   - Hi, I'm Audrey Anderson.

11:02.053 --> 11:04.220
      I am from the Valley.

11:04.239 --> 11:07.056
   Well, Van Nuys, California.

11:07.075 --> 11:07.832
         Hey (chuckles).

11:11.988 --> 11:14.321
  I just love dancing and I
  swear I've always wanted

11:14.341 --> 11:16.157
     to be a Renegades Girl.

11:16.176 --> 11:18.902
Well, I guess I shouldn't swear,

11:18.920 --> 11:19.844
  even though I really didn't.

11:19.921 --> 11:22.180
            Um, uh...

11:24.518 --> 11:26.184
 Look, I just, I love performing

11:26.335 --> 11:28.019
    and pouring my heart
    and soul into dancing

11:28.096 --> 11:32.248
       and I really want
      this and I promise

11:32.267 --> 11:33.483
  you I will work my butt off.

11:36.254 --> 11:37.195
          Go Renegades!

11:38.181 --> 11:39.197
              Yay.

11:45.706 --> 11:46.538
            Bye guys.

11:49.117 --> 11:50.266
         - Hey, Audrey.

11:50.285 --> 11:51.376
    It was great meeting you.

11:51.527 --> 11:53.712
 You're such an awesome dancer.

11:53.788 --> 11:55.046
       - Thanks, you too.

11:55.198 --> 11:56.439
    Except for I think I
 totally blew it at the end.

11:56.441 --> 11:58.049
     - Oh, come on, don't
        worry about it.

11:58.126 --> 12:00.293
       Look, it's just
     presentation, okay?

12:00.445 --> 12:01.553
  You're still in the runnin',

12:01.704 --> 12:03.388
      so don't start to
    get down on yourself.

12:03.465 --> 12:04.723
            - Thanks.

12:04.874 --> 12:06.373
    Do you wanna exchange
    numbers or something?

12:06.393 --> 12:07.183
        - Yeah, come on.

12:09.045 --> 12:11.229
        Yeah, we can go
      work out sometime.

12:11.306 --> 12:13.139
 Plus I know this really dope
   dance class in the Valley

12:13.291 --> 12:14.807
   that I know you would kill.

12:14.960 --> 12:16.309
      - I would love that.

12:16.461 --> 12:17.068
              Here.

12:17.220 --> 12:18.144
          - All right.

12:18.296 --> 12:18.978
       Catch you later.
            - Bye.

12:19.130 --> 12:19.738
         - [Tracy] Bye.

12:21.299 --> 12:23.483
     - You're such a loser!

12:23.635 --> 12:26.077
      You're such a loser!

12:26.154 --> 12:29.414
  And for the last time you
don't tell me who I can date!

12:29.491 --> 12:30.990
           We're done.

12:31.142 --> 12:32.158
      You're such a loser.

12:32.310 --> 12:35.044
         (pensive music)

12:46.324 --> 12:47.766
         - How'd it go?

12:47.842 --> 12:48.767
      - God, I don't know.

12:50.845 --> 12:55.348
Good, bad, somewhere in between.

12:55.500 --> 12:56.941
  They said they would call
   us within a week or so

12:57.018 --> 12:58.167
      and let us know if
      we made it or not.

12:58.169 --> 13:00.186
  - Well, I hope they call you.

13:00.338 --> 13:01.446
         Audrey, right?

13:01.523 --> 13:02.238
             - Yeah.

13:03.266 --> 13:04.282
          Your name is?

13:05.285 --> 13:06.509
            - Walter.

13:06.528 --> 13:07.285
        - Right (laughs).

13:08.530 --> 13:10.121
      You know, you seem
       really familiar,

13:10.198 --> 13:14.959
like I've seen your face before
but I just can't place it.

13:18.281 --> 13:21.357
       (Audrey laughs)
      (Walter chuckles)

13:21.359 --> 13:24.210
    How'd it go with Bailey?

13:24.362 --> 13:25.261
         - You saw that.

13:26.306 --> 13:30.049
       She's complicated.

13:30.201 --> 13:31.551
    Who are you waiting for?

13:31.703 --> 13:33.294
     - A ride share driver.

13:33.313 --> 13:34.720
     Although I don't know
    if he's coming anymore

13:34.873 --> 13:36.648
 because my phone just died, so.

13:36.799 --> 13:39.317
  - Well, if your phone died
    then he can't find you.

13:39.394 --> 13:40.968
       Where do you live?

13:40.987 --> 13:41.986
          - The Valley.

13:42.138 --> 13:42.895
      - I'm goin' that way.

13:43.048 --> 13:44.823
  Hop in, I'll give you a ride.

13:44.974 --> 13:47.141
       - Oh, no, I can't.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.142
         Thanks, though.

13:48.161 --> 13:50.662
         (gentle music)

13:57.729 --> 13:59.912
 So, how long did you two date?

14:00.065 --> 14:01.989
       - About six months.

14:02.008 --> 14:04.843
  She broke up with me right
  in the middle of playoffs.

14:04.919 --> 14:07.178
Said she didn't like me being
  on the road all the time

14:07.330 --> 14:10.014
    and then she goes and
    dates a team member?

14:11.167 --> 14:12.350
       - That had to hurt.

14:12.501 --> 14:14.352
     - Yeah, I just asked
    her if she could chill

14:14.429 --> 14:15.353
   it for a bit but she's all,

14:15.504 --> 14:17.580
      "You can't tell me
       who I can date."

14:17.599 --> 14:19.190
     - She probably hated
    the fact that you guys

14:19.342 --> 14:22.009
      have girlfriends in
     every city you play.

14:22.028 --> 14:22.861
             - What?

14:22.937 --> 14:24.195
           - We know.

14:24.347 --> 14:25.771
   Oh, and if you think I'm
    gonna have sex with you

14:25.924 --> 14:28.366
 just because you're some big
  time NBA basketball player,

14:28.443 --> 14:30.351
        you're gonna be
      very disappointed.

14:30.370 --> 14:31.518
             - Wow.

14:31.538 --> 14:33.371
        I can't believe-

14:33.448 --> 14:34.280
 - Wilt Chamberlain said that he

14:34.432 --> 14:35.874
 had sex with over 20,000 women.

14:36.025 --> 14:37.524
       - Well, I'm not
      Wilt Chamberlain.

14:37.544 --> 14:39.043
     - Well, that's obvious.

14:39.120 --> 14:40.786
   You're never gonna score
 more than 100 points a game.

14:40.939 --> 14:43.381
        - Jeez (laughs).

14:43.458 --> 14:46.050
   Okay, you may know your
     basketball history,

14:46.202 --> 14:47.385
     but you don't know me.

14:47.462 --> 14:48.369
          - Oh really?

14:48.388 --> 14:49.629
       What don't I know?

14:49.781 --> 14:50.388
          - I'm Bahai.

14:51.616 --> 14:52.390
        - And that means?

14:53.709 --> 14:55.618
    - It was in my "Sports
      Illustrated" issue.

14:55.637 --> 14:57.120
 - (laughs) People actually read

14:57.122 --> 14:58.563
the articles in those magazines?

14:59.624 --> 15:00.231
            - Funny.

15:00.383 --> 15:01.900
      Bahai is my religion

15:02.051 --> 15:03.902
     and we're celibate
    until we get married.

15:04.979 --> 15:05.645
             - Wow.

15:05.797 --> 15:07.480
      That is embarrassing.

15:07.632 --> 15:08.648
          - It's okay.

15:08.800 --> 15:10.149
         - No, it's not.

15:10.301 --> 15:14.971
    I was just teasing you
     and I shouldn't have.

15:14.973 --> 15:16.414
    - Let's forget about it.

15:16.565 --> 15:18.141
           Start over?

15:18.159 --> 15:18.917
            - Please.

15:18.993 --> 15:19.733
             - Okay.

15:19.753 --> 15:21.252
        I'm going first.

15:21.404 --> 15:24.330
    So Audrey, if you think
   I'm gonna sleep with you

15:24.482 --> 15:26.758
  just because you're some
  big time NBA cheerleader,

15:26.909 --> 15:29.243
      you are going to
      be very mistaken.

15:29.262 --> 15:32.079
   - Oh, I wish I was some
  big time NBA cheerleader.

15:32.098 --> 15:33.489
         - You will be.

15:33.508 --> 15:36.492
    And even then I still
    won't sleep with you.

15:36.511 --> 15:40.104
       (Audrey laughs)
       (Walter laughs)

15:40.256 --> 15:45.234
       (gentle music)
     (crickets chirping)

15:47.596 --> 15:49.522
    - Now you have my number.

15:49.674 --> 15:50.281
          - Yes, I do.

15:51.767 --> 15:52.742
      - You won't call me.

15:55.697 --> 15:56.846
      Thanks for the ride.

15:56.848 --> 16:01.584
       (gentle music)
     (crickets chirping)

16:09.194 --> 16:10.635
     And if I make the team,

16:10.786 --> 16:12.470
     I'll have to quit my
    job at the restaurant.

16:12.621 --> 16:14.363
- Honey, you never told me this.

16:14.365 --> 16:16.215
       Why do you have
      to quit your job?

16:16.367 --> 16:17.642
 - Because I wouldn't have time.

16:17.719 --> 16:20.478
   I mean, our season goes
   from September to June.

16:20.555 --> 16:23.206
      We have practices,
     41 home games a year

16:23.224 --> 16:25.374
        and we do a lot
      of charity events.

16:25.393 --> 16:28.319
     - And they only pay
      you $100 a game?

16:28.396 --> 16:29.487
            40 games.

16:29.638 --> 16:31.489
  So that's what, 4,000 a year?

16:31.640 --> 16:33.825
  - We do other things that
    make more money like,

16:33.976 --> 16:38.312
 like shopping mall openings,
 conventions, charity events.

16:38.331 --> 16:39.163
              What?

16:39.315 --> 16:40.723
      What's that look for?

16:40.742 --> 16:43.409
     - These players make
      millions every year

16:43.561 --> 16:46.229
      and they pay you
   cheerleaders gas money,

16:46.231 --> 16:48.231
and you can't even afford a car.

16:48.249 --> 16:49.340
    - Yeah, but it's a start.

16:49.492 --> 16:50.416
      As a Renegade Girl
        you meet a lot

16:50.568 --> 16:53.402
     of important people
       and companies.

16:53.404 --> 16:55.238
    It's a good opportunity.

16:55.240 --> 16:57.682
       - It's just, you
      were an A student.

16:57.833 --> 16:59.017
      - And now I'm sure
     you're gonna tell me

16:59.093 --> 17:00.243
      that I should've
     gone to law school.

17:00.261 --> 17:01.686
       - You should've
     gone to law school.

17:01.763 --> 17:03.429
       - Mom, can we not
      do this right now?

17:03.581 --> 17:05.022
    I had a really long day.

17:05.098 --> 17:06.357
       - Tell me about it.

17:06.509 --> 17:08.192
  I just worked a double shift.

17:09.587 --> 17:11.029
         - Point taken.

17:11.105 --> 17:16.034
  - You know I love you and
I'm glad you moved back home.

17:17.353 --> 17:19.162
    I missed you when you
     lived in the dorms.

17:21.690 --> 17:23.040
         (Audrey sighs)

17:23.117 --> 17:26.117
   - And I also got a ride
   home from Walter James.

17:26.271 --> 17:27.377
         - Walter, who?

17:27.454 --> 17:29.438
     - Mom, he's the star
       of the Renegades

17:29.457 --> 17:31.274
      and one of the best
    players in the league.

17:31.276 --> 17:32.775
     - [Jessica] Okay, and?

17:32.794 --> 17:35.536
     - And he's really cute.

17:35.555 --> 17:36.387
          - Is he nice?

17:36.539 --> 17:38.205
           - Very.
           - Rich?

17:38.224 --> 17:38.890
         - Millionaire.

17:39.041 --> 17:40.283
           - Perfect.

17:40.285 --> 17:42.060
     Sounds like marriage
        material to me.

17:42.211 --> 17:43.953
       - (gasps) Oh, okay.

17:43.971 --> 17:45.396
 So being a trophy wife is okay,

17:45.548 --> 17:47.899
      but being a dancer
     for a living is not.

17:48.050 --> 17:51.069
- $4,000 a year is not a living.

17:52.221 --> 17:54.814
  Look, I want you to be happy.

17:54.966 --> 17:55.907
        I'm here for you.

17:57.135 --> 17:57.867
         - Thanks, Mom.

17:58.894 --> 17:59.893
            Love you.

17:59.913 --> 18:01.579
        - Love you, too.

18:01.656 --> 18:04.640
       (pensive music)
     (crickets chirping)

18:04.659 --> 18:06.475
     - Archie, Mommy's home.

18:06.494 --> 18:07.752
            Hi, baby.

18:07.829 --> 18:10.313
     (Archie whimpering)
       (pensive music)

18:10.331 --> 18:15.259
       (fist knocking)
        (eerie music)

18:17.155 --> 18:17.887
         Right on time.

18:19.248 --> 18:20.098
      So, have you got it?

18:21.843 --> 18:23.175
              Good.

18:23.328 --> 18:25.103
     Let's just take care
     of this super quick.

18:25.179 --> 18:30.108
       (dramatic music)
       (Bailey choking)

18:35.840 --> 18:37.673
         (Bailey thuds)

18:37.692 --> 18:42.620
       (pensive music)
     (Archie whimpering)

18:44.773 --> 18:45.623
          (door clicks)

18:48.944 --> 18:53.356
        (birds chirping)

18:53.374 --> 18:55.925
         (phone ringing)

18:57.620 --> 18:58.452
          - Hey, Tracy.

18:58.471 --> 18:59.303
             - Hey.

19:00.882 --> 19:02.031
       Did they call you?

19:02.033 --> 19:03.790
         - No, not yet.

19:03.810 --> 19:05.309
     - Well, they called me.

19:06.537 --> 19:07.720
        I didn't make it.

19:07.872 --> 19:09.647
     - Oh, Tracy, I'm sorry.

19:09.724 --> 19:12.041
        - Everybody is
      gonna laugh at me.

19:12.043 --> 19:13.651
        - No they won't.

19:13.728 --> 19:17.155
 - I know it sounds pathetic
 to feel this way but I do.

19:18.733 --> 19:21.325
  - Just, I'm tired of bein'
    this desperate actress

19:21.402 --> 19:22.568
   just tryin' to get a break.

19:22.720 --> 19:24.553
        Hopin' to get
    noticed just by bein'

19:24.555 --> 19:27.814
     on this stupid team.
         (phone beeps)

19:27.834 --> 19:29.149
- Hey Tracy, I'm getting a call.

19:29.169 --> 19:30.501
     Let me get rid of them.

19:30.578 --> 19:31.394
          - No, don't.

19:31.412 --> 19:32.728
           It's them.

19:32.747 --> 19:34.321
      Answer it, they're
      callin' everybody.

19:34.340 --> 19:35.965
     - Okay, hold on a sec.

19:37.844 --> 19:39.159
         This is Audrey.

19:39.179 --> 19:41.846
    - Audrey, it's Cassie,
        Renegade Girls.

19:41.923 --> 19:43.589
      How you doin' today?

19:43.741 --> 19:46.075
     - Hey Cassie, I'm fine.

19:46.093 --> 19:48.436
   - I'm calling to talk to
   you about your audition.

19:49.931 --> 19:53.482
 Round four, public speaking,
    you didn't do so well.

19:54.694 --> 19:55.918
            - I know.

19:55.937 --> 19:57.528
     - Yeah, you really
   need to polish that up.

19:57.680 --> 20:00.198
  But when it comes to dancing,

20:00.349 --> 20:01.757
 we can really tell you love it

20:01.776 --> 20:03.259
        and it really
     shows in your work.

20:03.277 --> 20:05.277
        - Wow, thank you.

20:05.430 --> 20:06.779
              I do.

20:06.931 --> 20:10.374
  - We think you have what it
 takes to be a Renegade Girl.

20:10.526 --> 20:12.601
    We'd like to offer you
      a spot on the team.

20:12.620 --> 20:13.336
             - What?

20:14.272 --> 20:15.379
          Wait, really?

20:15.531 --> 20:16.939
         - Yes, really.

20:16.958 --> 20:18.716
    But Audrey, you have
    to be 100% committed.

20:18.867 --> 20:19.550
       Do you understand?

20:19.702 --> 20:20.551
     - Yes, yes, of course.

20:20.628 --> 20:22.111
      I am 100% committed.

20:22.129 --> 20:23.946
       It's such a dream
      to be on the team.

20:23.965 --> 20:24.780
         I'm so honored.

20:24.799 --> 20:25.723
       Thank you so much.

20:25.874 --> 20:27.116
            - Great.

20:27.134 --> 20:28.300
      All right, check
     your email tomorrow

20:28.453 --> 20:29.618
     and we'll see you at
     the gym on Saturday.

20:29.637 --> 20:30.811
       - Okay, thank you.

20:32.381 --> 20:36.959
       (Audrey exhales)
        (gentle music)

20:36.978 --> 20:39.070
 Oh Tracy, I'm sorry about that.

20:39.221 --> 20:40.129
         - Was it them?

20:40.147 --> 20:41.630
         - Yes (laughs).

20:41.649 --> 20:43.890
       I made the team,
     I'm a Renegade Girl!

20:43.910 --> 20:45.818
   - Congratulations, Audrey.

20:45.970 --> 20:48.579
        Really, really,
      I'm happy for you.

20:48.731 --> 20:49.580
          - Thank you.

20:49.657 --> 20:51.582
 Oh my God, I cannot believe it.

20:51.659 --> 20:56.420
 It's such a dream and it's
incredible and amazing and...

20:56.497 --> 20:59.482
    (sighs) Tracy, I'm so
    sorry, I feel awful.

20:59.500 --> 21:00.816
       - No, don't, don't.

21:00.835 --> 21:02.001
       I'm happy for you.

21:02.153 --> 21:03.744
         You deserve it.

21:03.763 --> 21:05.096
   Can we talk later, though?

21:05.172 --> 21:06.597
             - Sure.

21:06.749 --> 21:07.990
           But, Tracy-

21:08.009 --> 21:10.009
      - Okay, okay, I'ma
        call you later.

21:10.161 --> 21:11.102
              Bye.

21:11.253 --> 21:11.994
          (line clicks)

21:11.996 --> 21:15.014
         (gentle music)

21:15.166 --> 21:18.167
        (Audrey squeals)

21:18.185 --> 21:20.111
- I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm
 in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in,

21:20.262 --> 21:21.428
     I'm in, I'm in, I'm
     in, I'm in, I'm in,

21:21.447 --> 21:23.005
       I'm in, I'm in!
      (door bell rings)

21:23.024 --> 21:24.407
             Oh, oh!

21:28.362 --> 21:29.102
               Hi.

21:29.122 --> 21:30.771
             - Hey.

21:30.790 --> 21:32.123
  I was in the neighborhood,
  thought I'd take a chance,

21:32.274 --> 21:33.291
      see if you were here.

21:35.536 --> 21:37.110
           - I'm here.

21:37.130 --> 21:39.297
    - A little birdie told
     me you made the team?

21:39.448 --> 21:40.631
             - Wow.

21:40.708 --> 21:41.948
      Those birdies must
       be Renegade fans.

21:41.968 --> 21:42.883
        - So they called?

21:44.045 --> 21:44.710
           - They did.

21:44.862 --> 21:45.970
        - That's awesome.

21:46.047 --> 21:48.639
     Well, this is cause
      for celebration.

21:48.791 --> 21:49.890
      Come on, get dressed.

21:50.810 --> 21:52.810
        (gentle music)
       (birds chirping)

21:52.961 --> 21:53.811
       (glasses clinking)

21:53.962 --> 21:56.605
         (gentle music)

22:20.581 --> 22:23.257
        (shutter clicks)

22:27.180 --> 22:29.738
        (geese squawking)

22:29.740 --> 22:32.183
         (gentle music)

22:44.422 --> 22:45.846
    - Oh, that was a fun day.

22:45.865 --> 22:47.089
         Thank you for
     celebrating with me.

22:47.108 --> 22:48.924
       - I couldn't have
     you celebrate alone.

22:48.943 --> 22:49.700
         (Audrey laughs)

22:49.852 --> 22:51.927
 - That would've been very sad.

22:51.946 --> 22:53.371
  And besides making the team,

22:53.522 --> 22:55.948
 I guess you're pretty decent
    to hang out with, too.

22:56.100 --> 22:57.190
        - Oh, I'm decent?

22:57.210 --> 22:58.542
              Okay.

22:58.619 --> 23:00.936
     No one's ever called
       me decent before.

23:00.955 --> 23:01.937
      - Actually, you are.

23:01.956 --> 23:02.605
             - Yeah?

23:02.623 --> 23:03.506
         - Very much so.

23:06.444 --> 23:09.294
     So, if you were to
   kiss me right now would

23:09.447 --> 23:10.871
   that violate your religion?

23:10.890 --> 23:12.056
        - Oh, absolutely.

23:12.133 --> 23:13.782
       I mean, there's
     the petition I have

23:13.801 --> 23:17.228
to get from the church, two day
waiting period, a sacrifice.

23:22.810 --> 23:23.901
  - I couldn't wait (chuckles).

23:24.052 --> 23:24.793
           - I'm glad.

23:24.795 --> 23:27.238
         (gentle music)

23:36.157 --> 23:38.974
      (dancers chattering)

23:38.993 --> 23:39.917
          - Hey, girl.

23:45.483 --> 23:46.757
        - Tracy (laughs)?

23:46.909 --> 23:48.426
   - Audrey, oh my gosh, hey!

23:48.502 --> 23:50.577
      - What in the world?

23:50.596 --> 23:52.171
    What are you doin' here?

23:52.323 --> 23:54.598
      - Well, they called
     me about an hour ago

23:54.750 --> 23:56.325
       and told me that
       I made the team!

23:56.327 --> 23:57.509
        - Oh my God!
       (Tracy screams)

23:57.662 --> 23:58.769
         That's amazing.

23:58.846 --> 24:00.104
        What made them
      change their mind?

24:00.181 --> 24:01.346
   - Girl, I don't know but
   you think I'm gonna ask?

24:01.499 --> 24:02.998
            - No.
 - And you don't ask either.

24:03.017 --> 24:03.924
             - Okay!

24:03.943 --> 24:04.833
        (Tracy squeals)
       (Audrey squeals)

24:04.852 --> 24:05.943
        - Okay, let's go.

24:06.094 --> 24:11.031
       (upbeat music)
  (camera shutter clicking)

24:20.108 --> 24:21.107
      - [Cassie] There we
     go, please stand up.

24:21.127 --> 24:22.126
         - Okay, Tracy.

24:22.277 --> 24:23.919
          There we go.

24:24.855 --> 24:26.297
   Oh, nice smile, beautiful.

24:26.448 --> 24:27.631
           All right.

24:27.783 --> 24:29.449
    Now, a little bit of
    attitude on that one.

24:29.469 --> 24:30.617
              Nice.

24:30.636 --> 24:31.785
              Good.

24:31.804 --> 24:33.529
 All right, Audrey, nice smile.

24:33.547 --> 24:34.955
        Beautiful, great.

24:34.974 --> 24:36.031
         That's awesome.

24:36.050 --> 24:38.200
 Okay, a little attitude, right?

24:38.219 --> 24:39.643
            Good job.

24:39.720 --> 24:40.644
  Okay, can you do a little
     flip and look back?

24:40.796 --> 24:41.979
             Great.

24:42.130 --> 24:43.055
              Nice.

24:43.207 --> 24:43.814
         Okay, now nice.

24:43.966 --> 24:44.648
      Very wholesome smile.

24:44.800 --> 24:46.041
          There we go.

24:46.060 --> 24:47.133
      All right, let's
     all move over here.

24:47.153 --> 24:48.134
     Let's do a group photo.

24:48.154 --> 24:49.135
         - [Dancer] Yes!

24:49.155 --> 24:49.653
       - [Photographer]
       Okay, fantastic.

24:49.805 --> 24:50.713
             - Woo!

24:50.731 --> 24:51.989
  - All right, that was great.

24:53.217 --> 24:54.717
   Okay, right into the lens.

24:54.735 --> 24:56.235
         Nice big smile.

24:56.387 --> 24:57.661
        Beautiful family.

24:57.813 --> 24:58.554
           Here we go.

24:58.572 --> 25:00.222
         Oh, great shot.

25:00.224 --> 25:01.056
     Ladies, you nailed it.

25:01.075 --> 25:02.166
           - Woo!
      - That's perfect.

25:02.243 --> 25:03.149
      (dancers applauding)

25:03.169 --> 25:04.059
    - Okay, great, thank you.

25:04.078 --> 25:05.002
         Thanks so much.

25:05.079 --> 25:06.562
       Great work, ladies.

25:06.580 --> 25:09.840
   Take a break and in five,
just meet me in the bleachers.

25:09.992 --> 25:12.158
      (dancers laughing)
     (dancers chattering)

25:12.178 --> 25:13.418
  - I don't know, how you feel?

25:13.571 --> 25:15.754
   - I felt good about it.
           - Yeah.

25:15.906 --> 25:17.014
      - You were killin'
        your poses, so-

25:17.165 --> 25:19.258
     - Oh, thanks, girl.
     - Not bad for you.

25:19.410 --> 25:21.243
       - Hey, what's up
      with Coach Cassie?

25:21.262 --> 25:22.745
     She seems kinda bummed.

25:22.763 --> 25:25.171
   - Are we really calling
    her Coach Cassie now?

25:25.191 --> 25:27.249
  - [Tracy] And where's Bailey?

25:27.268 --> 25:29.109
   - Maybe she didn't make
     the team after all.

25:31.697 --> 25:32.604
               Oh!

25:32.757 --> 25:33.589
       (Tracy laughs)
       (Audrey laughs)

25:33.607 --> 25:36.258
   - Oh my God, I'm so sorry.

25:36.260 --> 25:37.426
          Are you okay?

25:37.428 --> 25:38.869
      - Yeah, I'm fine.
       - I'm so sorry.

25:39.021 --> 25:40.095
          - It's fine.

25:40.114 --> 25:42.355
   - That's right, hilarious.

25:42.375 --> 25:44.524
         (pensive music)

25:44.544 --> 25:46.168
      You expect me to
      wipe that up, hm?

25:47.529 --> 25:49.029
    Think you're so pretty
     you can walk around,

25:49.048 --> 25:50.122
      make a big mess,
      then guys like me

25:50.198 --> 25:52.198
       are supposed to
     clean up after you?

25:52.218 --> 25:54.701
  - We didn't say anything.
  - I'll go get some water

25:54.720 --> 25:56.278
       and paper towels
      from the bathroom.

25:56.297 --> 25:59.464
- You need pH neutral cleaning
    solution for hardwood.

25:59.617 --> 26:01.133
   Water is the worst thing
    for basketball courts.

26:01.285 --> 26:02.059
        - It's all right.

26:02.210 --> 26:03.468
   Lou, I'll take care of it.

26:03.621 --> 26:05.454
  - I'm sorry, Mrs. McConnell.

26:05.456 --> 26:06.880
        I just finished
    waxing the whole floor

26:06.899 --> 26:08.857
        two days ago.
      - Lou, it's okay.

26:10.218 --> 26:11.402
            - Sorry.

26:11.478 --> 26:12.403
       - That's all right.

26:13.573 --> 26:14.963
        - [Audrey] Oh,
      let me, I'm sorry.

26:14.965 --> 26:15.964
      - Oh no, I've got it.

26:15.983 --> 26:16.699
           It's fine.

26:18.393 --> 26:19.468
          - Thank you.

26:19.486 --> 26:20.803
  - And don't worry about Lou.

26:20.821 --> 26:22.997
    He comes off rough but
   he's really a sweet guy.

26:24.917 --> 26:26.308
    - I'm Audrey, by the way.

26:26.327 --> 26:26.992
             - Nora.

26:27.144 --> 26:28.419
        Nice to meet you.

26:28.570 --> 26:30.087
    - Do you have work here?

26:31.424 --> 26:33.148
    - Yeah, you can say that.

26:33.167 --> 26:34.983
        - [Dancer] Mm hm.

26:34.985 --> 26:35.818
      - [Dancer] Oh my God.

26:35.836 --> 26:38.095
       (dancers chuckling)

26:38.246 --> 26:39.504
    - [Audrey] Who was that?

26:39.657 --> 26:41.098
        - Nora McConnell.

26:41.175 --> 26:44.827
      She's the Executive
  Director of the Renegades.

26:44.845 --> 26:46.845
   She's married to the owner.

26:46.997 --> 26:49.106
    - Great, they should
  just cut me now (laughs).

26:49.257 --> 26:51.333
        - [Tatiana] Yes.

26:51.352 --> 26:52.167
       - How embarrassing.

26:52.169 --> 26:53.235
      - Speak of the devil.

26:56.949 --> 26:58.115
             - What?

26:58.266 --> 26:59.191
      - Michael McConnell,

26:59.343 --> 27:01.101
       rich, handsome.
            - Hi.

27:01.120 --> 27:02.435
- I've been wantin' to meet him.

27:02.455 --> 27:04.121
   - Girl, he's like ancient.

27:04.198 --> 27:05.605
      - That is just fine.

27:05.625 --> 27:07.124
     So come with me, I
   wanna get an autograph.

27:07.201 --> 27:09.017
- No, we can't go over there.
         - Come on!

27:09.036 --> 27:10.944
            - No.
     - Come on, come on.

27:10.963 --> 27:11.795
     Just don't tell nobody.

27:11.947 --> 27:12.963
   - [Audrey] (groans) Tracy!

27:14.208 --> 27:15.707
  - [Tracy] Hi, Mr. McConnell.

27:15.860 --> 27:16.692
              - Hi.

27:16.710 --> 27:18.193
  - Can I have your autograph?

27:18.212 --> 27:18.969
             - Sure.

27:20.139 --> 27:21.305
        What's your name?

27:21.456 --> 27:22.455
            - Tracy.

27:22.475 --> 27:24.366
            - Tracy.

27:24.385 --> 27:26.034
      Is there something
     that I can write on?

27:26.053 --> 27:27.269
       - Yeah, thank you.

27:30.316 --> 27:31.482
     - Well, that's perfect.

27:34.395 --> 27:35.319
           - Michael?

27:37.214 --> 27:38.213
            Michael?

27:38.232 --> 27:38.989
          - Oh, right.

27:39.975 --> 27:40.658
          - Thank you.

27:45.814 --> 27:47.406
    Thank you, Mr. McConnell.

27:47.558 --> 27:48.907
             Mm hm.

27:49.059 --> 27:50.909
        - [Audrey] Tracy!

27:51.061 --> 27:52.169
        (birds chirping)

27:52.246 --> 27:55.964
     - We have some very
       sad news today.

27:59.161 --> 28:00.903
     The police informed
       us this morning

28:00.921 --> 28:04.181
 that Bailey West was found dead

28:04.258 --> 28:05.574
  in her apartment last night.

28:05.592 --> 28:06.517
        (dancers gasping)

28:06.593 --> 28:07.351
            Murdered.

28:09.430 --> 28:11.021
      - I wonder if they
       know who did it.

28:11.932 --> 28:14.191
- I know it's a shock to us all.

28:14.342 --> 28:18.086
       Bailey was such a
    beautiful young woman,

28:19.273 --> 28:22.366
 and I remember how happy she
  was on the team last year.

28:25.353 --> 28:26.704
              I...

28:26.855 --> 28:28.280
    (dancers sobbing softly)

28:28.432 --> 28:30.541
    - You may be contacted
         by the press.

28:32.119 --> 28:35.212
They'll probably want gossip
about Bailey's personal life.

28:35.289 --> 28:37.606
    All we ask is that you
      please keep in mind

28:37.624 --> 28:41.109
      that you represent
      this organization,

28:41.128 --> 28:43.628
   and to have some respect
     for Bailey's privacy.

28:43.781 --> 28:44.471
             - Wow.

28:46.041 --> 28:48.225
    Bailey would've loved
     all this attention.

28:48.302 --> 28:53.313
        (solemn music)
   (dancers sobbing softly)

28:55.067 --> 28:57.568
       - Detective, I
  appreciate all your help.

29:01.815 --> 29:05.058
         (solemn music)

29:05.077 --> 29:08.804
   - [Walter] I just can't
   believe this happened.

29:08.822 --> 29:10.247
     - [Audrey] This must
       be hard for you.

29:11.399 --> 29:12.249
        - I did love her.

29:13.644 --> 29:14.334
            - Sorry.

29:16.905 --> 29:18.255
    - How could somebody
   do something like this?

29:18.332 --> 29:20.665
      - It's gonna sound
        a little crazy.

29:20.818 --> 29:21.925
             - What?

29:22.077 --> 29:23.485
     - There's this girl
     on the dance team.

29:23.504 --> 29:24.319
          Her name is-

29:24.338 --> 29:25.053
           - Hey boss?

29:26.340 --> 29:27.247
       Some cops are here.

29:27.266 --> 29:28.432
     They wanna talk to you.

29:28.509 --> 29:33.437
      (water splashing)
       (solemn music)

29:41.188 --> 29:45.857
    - Mr. James, Detective
     Logan Jameson, LAPD.

29:46.010 --> 29:49.027
   There's a few questions
   I need to ask if I may.

29:50.272 --> 29:53.606
     - I wish you would've
 called first but no problem.

29:53.626 --> 29:56.627
- I'm assuming that you heard
  the news about Miss West?

29:56.778 --> 29:58.703
         - Yeah, I did.

29:58.856 --> 30:00.798
    - Where were you last
   night between the hours

30:00.949 --> 30:02.615
   of nine p.m. and midnight?

30:02.635 --> 30:04.709
      - I was at the beach.

30:04.862 --> 30:05.969
         - [Detective
     Jameson] Doin' what?

30:06.121 --> 30:08.046
   - He likes to go jogging
     on the sand at night.

30:08.198 --> 30:10.641
 It helps out his calf muscles.

30:10.717 --> 30:11.958
      - Please allow Mr.
        James to answer

30:11.977 --> 30:13.869
the questions if you don't mind.

30:13.871 --> 30:14.645
         - You're good.

30:15.889 --> 30:17.039
     - Anybody go with you?

30:17.041 --> 30:18.040
         - I was alone.

30:18.042 --> 30:20.150
        I went around...

30:20.227 --> 30:20.984
             - 9:15.

30:21.136 --> 30:22.778
   You got back around 10:30.

30:24.064 --> 30:25.972
      - We have witnesses
     that saw you arguing

30:25.991 --> 30:29.142
   with Miss West the night
     that she was killed.

30:30.145 --> 30:31.720
      We believe that you
     were the last person

30:31.738 --> 30:32.904
      to be seen with her.

30:33.057 --> 30:34.556
    Additionally, we believe

30:34.575 --> 30:35.999
    that the murder weapon
       belonged to you.

30:36.076 --> 30:37.742
         (pensive music)

30:37.895 --> 30:39.002
             - What?

30:39.154 --> 30:41.413
   - Look, this brings me
   no pleasure and I mean,

30:41.565 --> 30:43.915
    I'm a huge fan of yours,

30:44.068 --> 30:46.009
   but I'm gonna need you
  to ride downtown with me.

30:46.161 --> 30:48.904
      We'll have further
   questions at the station

30:48.922 --> 30:51.331
       and we'll need to
     take some DNA swabs.

30:51.350 --> 30:52.924
     - No, you're makin'
       a big mistake.

30:53.077 --> 30:54.409
      - George, it's fine.

30:54.428 --> 30:55.435
      - I hope he's right.

30:56.747 --> 30:58.096
  - Call my lawyers right away.

30:58.248 --> 30:59.414
            - I will.

30:59.433 --> 31:00.765
     - I'm sorry about this.

31:00.918 --> 31:01.984
    - [Detective Jameson]
    Sorry, we need to go.

31:03.921 --> 31:05.253
     - I'm gonna get this
       cleared up, okay?

31:05.272 --> 31:06.938
 Please give Audrey a ride home.

31:07.091 --> 31:07.698
             - Yeah.

31:07.774 --> 31:10.117
         (pensive music)

31:14.765 --> 31:16.114
    - [Reporter] Police have

31:16.191 --> 31:18.041
  just arrested Los Angeles
Renegades star, Walter James,

31:18.193 --> 31:20.360
    in connection to the
 murder of his ex girlfriend

31:20.379 --> 31:22.862
        and Renegade
  cheerleader, Bailey West.

31:22.882 --> 31:26.199
  LAPD reports the cause of
  death was strangulation.

31:26.218 --> 31:29.035
      DNA from James was
     found on Bailey West

31:29.054 --> 31:30.629
 as well as the Renegade jersey

31:30.781 --> 31:32.055
  that was used in the murder.

31:32.207 --> 31:35.708
Last season, Walter James led
the league in points in his-

31:35.728 --> 31:37.285
  - I can't watch this anymore.

31:37.304 --> 31:38.395
          - Oh my God.

31:38.546 --> 31:40.639
       And you just had
       a date with him.

31:40.791 --> 31:42.065
       That's frightening.

31:42.217 --> 31:44.292
 - I can't believe everything
   they're saying right now.

31:44.311 --> 31:46.886
 - They're saying it's steroids.

31:46.906 --> 31:48.130
             - Mom.

31:48.148 --> 31:50.741
    - How many times have
    we heard this story?

31:50.817 --> 31:54.803
      Football players,
  baseball players, boxers.

31:54.821 --> 31:57.989
     They get pumped up on
   these enhancement drugs.

31:58.142 --> 31:59.416
       They argue with
      their girlfriends

31:59.493 --> 32:01.143
  and the next thing you know,

32:01.161 --> 32:03.645
 they're wheeling these girls
   into the emergency room.

32:03.664 --> 32:06.739
       - (sighs) I'm not
     convinced he did it.

32:06.759 --> 32:09.651
   - Honey, I know you have
     a crush on this guy.

32:09.653 --> 32:12.003
       I'm sorry, but
     they found his DNA.

32:12.156 --> 32:14.414
      - I know, I'm aware.

32:14.433 --> 32:17.684
   - You have no idea what
    kind of person he is.

32:20.773 --> 32:22.347
           I'm sorry.

32:23.350 --> 32:25.943
      It's just, I don't
     know what I would do

32:26.094 --> 32:28.028
       if anything ever
       happened to you.

32:30.190 --> 32:31.114
         - I know, Mom.

32:34.194 --> 32:35.118
           - I'm beat.

32:35.195 --> 32:36.936
        I'm goin' to bed.

32:36.956 --> 32:38.363
  Try not to stay up all night.

32:38.515 --> 32:41.124
      I know you got a
      lot on your mind.

32:42.369 --> 32:43.109
           I'm sorry.

32:43.128 --> 32:45.712
         (solemn music)

32:54.047 --> 32:56.214
   - Five, six, seven, eight.

32:56.366 --> 32:57.265
          One and two.

32:58.702 --> 32:59.884
              Good.

33:00.037 --> 33:01.311
  Okay, good, good, good, good.

33:01.388 --> 33:03.963
    So when you do come up
     and you do the stomp

33:03.983 --> 33:07.800
   and you're up like this,
    elbows out, hands wide.

33:07.820 --> 33:08.710
             Got it?

33:08.729 --> 33:09.635
           All right.

33:09.655 --> 33:10.378
    Just do it one more time.

33:10.397 --> 33:11.304
    Five, six, seven, eight.

33:11.323 --> 33:12.881
         You go uh, uh.

33:12.899 --> 33:13.732
        Good, let me see.

33:13.884 --> 33:15.066
      Okay, that's enough.

33:15.219 --> 33:16.660
      I like it, good job.

33:16.811 --> 33:17.977
            Take 10.

33:17.997 --> 33:18.903
              Okay.

33:19.056 --> 33:20.146
         - Thank you.
            - Yeah.

33:20.165 --> 33:21.814
            - See ya.

33:21.834 --> 33:23.058
            Good job.

33:23.076 --> 33:23.725
        - Thank you.
      - Good job, yeah.

33:23.744 --> 33:26.503
         (pensive music)

33:26.654 --> 33:28.171
  - [Blonde Dancer] I heard
 he beat up a guy in Dallas.

33:28.323 --> 33:30.340
- [Brunette Dancer] Didn't he
choke his coach at practice?

33:30.417 --> 33:33.176
         (pensive music)

33:34.755 --> 33:37.264
  - He snapped because Bailey
 had sex with another player.

33:39.092 --> 33:41.092
  - [Dancer] I heard he was
   jogging alone at night.

33:41.245 --> 33:42.168
              Okay.

33:42.187 --> 33:43.578
     - Pretty than alibi
       if you ask me.

33:43.597 --> 33:45.355
      - I know right, it
      sounds suspicious.

33:47.860 --> 33:49.434
      - [Blonde Dancer] I
    heard it was steroids.

33:49.586 --> 33:51.194
      - I think it was a
       crime of passion.

33:53.106 --> 33:54.256
  - [Audrey] Hey girl (sighs).

33:54.258 --> 33:55.515
             - Hey.

33:55.534 --> 33:57.868
   - Jeez, the gossip mill
   is in overdrive today.

33:57.944 --> 33:59.202
   Everyone's acting so crazy.

33:59.354 --> 34:03.790
  - Mm, I think everybody's
  just in shock, you know?

34:05.360 --> 34:06.451
            - Maybe.

34:06.603 --> 34:09.195
      (lock screen clicks)

34:09.214 --> 34:13.291
     - I mean, you went
     on a date with him.

34:13.443 --> 34:17.137
     So, did he seem like
      on murderer to you?

34:19.283 --> 34:20.724
  - He's just a suspect, Tracy.

34:20.875 --> 34:22.809
    Innocent until proven
      guilty, remember?

34:25.230 --> 34:26.396
       - Whatever you say.

34:27.882 --> 34:29.232
  Be careful, girl (chuckles).

34:31.235 --> 34:33.295
       - I mean, someone
     else coulda done it.

34:33.313 --> 34:36.989
For instance, you kinda
benefited from this whole thing.

34:37.967 --> 34:39.076
     - What does that mean?

34:39.226 --> 34:43.080
    - Well, you don't make
    the team, Bailey dies,

34:43.231 --> 34:46.474
  spot opens up and suddenly
      you're on the team.

34:46.493 --> 34:49.402
   - That's a really messed
   up thing to say, Audrey.

34:49.420 --> 34:51.313
What the hell is wrong with you?

34:51.331 --> 34:52.981
   - You're right, I'm sorry.

34:52.983 --> 34:53.840
        - You should be.

34:55.427 --> 34:56.842
      - Wait, Tracy, wait.

34:58.430 --> 35:00.505
    Look, I'm just saying I
  don't think Walter did it.

35:00.657 --> 35:02.490
       - So you accuse me?

35:02.492 --> 35:04.917
      - No, but when I
      met you said that

35:04.937 --> 35:06.828
      if be didn't make
     the team this year,

35:06.847 --> 35:09.922
  you used swore to God, you
   were gonna kill somebody.

35:09.942 --> 35:11.182
         You said that.

35:11.335 --> 35:12.684
            - Really?

35:12.836 --> 35:15.946
It's called sarcasm, Audrey,
and I told you that in private.

35:16.097 --> 35:19.265
- I know I'm just giving you
examples of what people think

35:19.284 --> 35:21.434
 when you say things like that.

35:21.453 --> 35:22.935
 I mean, you also said you were

35:22.955 --> 35:24.770
a desperate actress that would
  do anything to get a break.

35:24.790 --> 35:25.530
        - You know what?

35:25.682 --> 35:26.289
              Stop.

35:26.441 --> 35:27.707
       Screw you, Audrey.

35:29.128 --> 35:32.945
Actually, you're the one
that's dating her ex boyfriend.

35:32.965 --> 35:34.372
    Maybe you killed Bailey.

35:34.524 --> 35:35.632
            - Ladies.

35:35.783 --> 35:37.450
      - I was with my mom
    when she was murdered.

35:37.469 --> 35:38.951
     Where were you, Tracy?

35:38.971 --> 35:39.878
         - Where was I?

35:40.030 --> 35:41.196
           - Yeah.
          - Ladies.

35:41.214 --> 35:42.364
       - Where was I?
      - Where were you?

35:42.382 --> 35:42.955
       - Knock it off.
    - Get out of my face!

35:42.975 --> 35:43.698
         - Break it up!

35:43.717 --> 35:45.700
      Tracy, get some air.

35:45.719 --> 35:47.385
        Take her outside.

35:47.537 --> 35:48.770
 Audrey, what'd you say to her?

35:50.223 --> 35:53.224
        - I was at my
     acting class, okay?

35:53.377 --> 35:56.444
We did a scene from
"Streetcar" and I was terrible.

35:57.547 --> 35:58.804
         Ask my teacher.

35:58.824 --> 36:01.049
  She'll tell you all about it.

36:01.051 --> 36:01.825
         You happy now?

36:06.832 --> 36:09.833
        - My office, now.

36:09.910 --> 36:12.502
         (pensive music)

36:13.655 --> 36:15.079
          (phone beeps)

36:15.232 --> 36:15.914
         - LA Renegades.

36:16.066 --> 36:18.508
         (pensive music)

36:22.422 --> 36:23.847
       - What the hell's
     the matter with you?

36:23.998 --> 36:25.515
      - Coach, I'm sorry.
  - Have you lost your mind?

36:25.667 --> 36:27.517
     You think that Tracy
    killed Bailey in order

36:27.594 --> 36:29.186
  to get her spot on the team?

36:29.337 --> 36:32.580
 - No, I just, I just said I
 don't think Walter did it.

36:32.582 --> 36:33.839
         - Well, great.

36:33.859 --> 36:34.933
      You and millions
      of other NBA fans

36:35.085 --> 36:36.509
 don't think that Walter did it.

36:36.528 --> 36:37.435
     You know what I think?

36:37.587 --> 36:39.512
  I think I don't give a crap!

36:39.531 --> 36:40.939
       Do you know how
     many dancers I have

36:41.091 --> 36:42.848
      on file that could
       take your place?

36:42.868 --> 36:44.016
    - I'll apologize to her.

36:44.036 --> 36:45.452
     - Damn right you will.

36:47.447 --> 36:52.450
       (Cassie sighs)
       (pensive music)

36:53.437 --> 36:56.338
       Listen, I don't
      wanna let you go.

36:58.383 --> 36:59.457
 It's just if you pull something

36:59.609 --> 37:01.443
  like this again, you're gone.

37:01.461 --> 37:02.777
         You understand?

37:02.779 --> 37:03.553
             - Yes.

37:05.615 --> 37:06.306
             - Good.

37:08.452 --> 37:09.542
      Now get back to work.

37:09.561 --> 37:10.952
      - But Coach, can
     ask you a question?

37:10.954 --> 37:11.786
              - No.

37:11.805 --> 37:13.121
     - Suppose he did do it.

37:13.139 --> 37:15.482
     What reason would he
     have to kill Bailey?

37:17.069 --> 37:19.694
   - I can think of a lot of
 reasons to kill Bailey West.

37:20.739 --> 37:22.030
    Walter said he loved her,

37:23.725 --> 37:28.495
   but he wouldn't have sex
  with her so she got bored.

37:29.639 --> 37:31.414
  Then she started treating him

37:31.491 --> 37:36.378
   like she treats everyone
       else, like dirt.

37:39.165 --> 37:41.149
       And that's one
     reason right there.

37:41.167 --> 37:43.677
         (pensive music)

37:46.598 --> 37:48.339
 Tell the girls I need a minute.

37:48.492 --> 37:51.226
         (pensive music)

37:57.834 --> 37:58.666
  - [Tracy] And he's telling me

37:58.685 --> 38:02.020
 it's all my fault, like really?

38:02.172 --> 38:03.671
 And that's what I told him.
          - Tracy?

38:03.690 --> 38:04.764
        - [Tracy] See ya.

38:04.783 --> 38:05.949
      - [Audrey] I'm sorry.

38:06.100 --> 38:06.783
             - Ugh.

38:08.120 --> 38:10.528
     And then there were
     flowers at my door,

38:10.680 --> 38:12.772
   so I don't know, we'll see.

38:12.791 --> 38:14.291
    - Oh my God, how good
     do playoffs sound?

38:14.442 --> 38:16.960
    - Ugh, I can not wait.
          - Patrice.

38:17.037 --> 38:18.444
         (dancer laughs)

38:18.463 --> 38:19.854
       - Wait, don't you
     have a date tonight?

38:19.873 --> 38:21.022
        - [Tatiana] I do.

38:21.041 --> 38:25.885
        (pensive music)
   (shower water splashing)

38:37.649 --> 38:39.223
       - [Bailey] What's
      the matter, Coach?

38:39.376 --> 38:42.377
   You worried that someday
      I'll have your job?

38:42.395 --> 38:43.302
 - [Cassie] I can think of a lot

38:43.322 --> 38:44.654
 of reasons to kill Bailey West.

38:45.991 --> 38:48.575
         (cart rattling)

38:50.162 --> 38:55.123
        (pensive music)
   (shower water splashing)

38:56.576 --> 38:59.485
   - [Jessica] I'm sorry,
   but they found his DNA.

38:59.504 --> 39:00.578
- [Detective Jameson] We believe

39:00.730 --> 39:02.172
      the murder weapon
      belonged to you.

39:02.323 --> 39:07.177
        (pensive music)
   (shower water splashing)

39:09.348 --> 39:10.755
     - [Tracy] If I don't
   make the team this year,

39:10.907 --> 39:12.015
    I'm gonna kill somebody.

39:12.166 --> 39:13.516
        (faucet squeaks)

39:13.593 --> 39:16.353
         (pensive music)

39:35.189 --> 39:38.833
       (singer vocalizing)

40:35.325 --> 40:37.825
        (Audrey gasps)
       (dramatic music)

40:37.827 --> 40:39.661
       - I'm sorry, I
    shouldn't be in here.

40:39.679 --> 40:41.329
          - It's okay.

40:41.347 --> 40:43.773
      You're one of the
      new girls, right?

40:43.850 --> 40:44.607
         I remember you.

40:46.445 --> 40:47.593
  Stay as long as you want.
       (Audrey gasps)

40:47.612 --> 40:50.363
        (dramatic music)

40:56.455 --> 40:59.289
        (Walter grunting)

41:02.702 --> 41:04.794
   - Hey boss, Audrey's here.

41:07.966 --> 41:09.883
      - Oh, don't let me
     stop you (chuckles).

41:11.619 --> 41:12.969
              - No.

41:13.120 --> 41:14.471
      It's good to see you.

41:14.622 --> 41:15.805
           - You too.

41:15.957 --> 41:17.640
 - I'm surprised you showed up.

41:17.792 --> 41:19.050
      - Well, don't tell
     my mother I came by.

41:19.202 --> 41:21.552
      (Walter chuckles)
      (Audrey chuckles)

41:21.705 --> 41:23.146
    Well, I guess if you're
 gonna be under house arrest,

41:23.297 --> 41:25.648
      this is certainly
     the house to be at.

41:25.725 --> 41:27.725
      - Legal team got me
     on bail pretty fast.

41:27.877 --> 41:30.320
  - I heard you have the best
 lawyers in town helping you.

41:31.156 --> 41:32.822
   - Best and most expensive.

41:34.884 --> 41:36.718
     - I've been thinkin'
       about you a lot.

41:36.736 --> 41:37.494
             - Yeah?

41:38.888 --> 41:40.145
  - I mean the whole situation.

41:40.165 --> 41:41.906
     The papers say that
     you were jacked up

41:42.058 --> 41:44.242
  on steroids and freaked out.

41:44.394 --> 41:45.752
   - I've never done steroids.

41:46.730 --> 41:48.171
      None of that is true.

41:48.322 --> 41:49.655
     Did you really choke
        out that coach?

41:49.674 --> 41:51.341
     - That never happened.

41:52.677 --> 41:55.178
    - Well, what about the
  guy you beat up in Dallas?

41:55.329 --> 41:57.347
        - That was some
     straight arm dealing

41:57.498 --> 41:59.590
   with some drunk, angry fan.

41:59.743 --> 42:01.017
 I didn't mean to knock him out.

42:03.004 --> 42:03.686
             - Okay.

42:05.248 --> 42:07.673
    But they found your DNA.

42:07.692 --> 42:08.933
 They said it was on the jersey.

42:09.085 --> 42:11.176
 - That may have been my jersey.

42:11.196 --> 42:12.946
     I don't, I don't know.

42:14.758 --> 42:16.199
    I think I was set up or
   something, I don't know.

42:17.852 --> 42:18.535
            - Set up?

42:19.704 --> 42:20.537
             By who?

42:23.116 --> 42:25.449
      I mean, Walter, you
    said you loved Bailey,

42:25.602 --> 42:27.043
 that you never had sex with her

42:27.194 --> 42:29.453
     and then she goes and
   has sex with a teammate.

42:29.606 --> 42:32.715
      I mean, it must've
       really upset you.

42:34.052 --> 42:35.468
    - Not enough to kill her.

42:36.871 --> 42:37.703
   Are you done with all this?

42:37.722 --> 42:39.538
 Because maybe you should leave.

42:39.558 --> 42:40.965
    - Walter, wait, look,
      just hear me out.

42:41.117 --> 42:42.392
      - I've heard enough.

42:42.543 --> 42:44.060
     - I had to ask those
questions, I just had to know.

42:44.137 --> 42:46.712
         - To know what?

42:46.731 --> 42:48.806
      That I'm not some
     cold blooded killer

42:48.958 --> 42:49.983
    and that you're not next?

42:51.628 --> 42:53.570
         (Walter sighs)

42:53.721 --> 42:56.239
       - I'm sorry, okay?

42:58.059 --> 42:59.483
      I just need to know.

42:59.636 --> 43:01.828
 And yes, that is why I came by.

43:03.139 --> 43:04.747
    I'm on your side, Walter.

43:07.811 --> 43:09.085
  I never thought you did this.

43:11.331 --> 43:12.088
              Okay?

43:13.407 --> 43:14.090
             - Yeah.

43:15.819 --> 43:17.093
             Thanks.

43:17.244 --> 43:18.336
           - So, wait.

43:18.488 --> 43:21.339
There's Lou, the creepy janitor,

43:21.491 --> 43:23.825
      Cassie, the crazy
      coach and Tracy,

43:23.843 --> 43:25.935
  the hot blooded cheerleader.

43:26.087 --> 43:28.771
  This is beginning to sound
like an episode of "Dateline."

43:30.091 --> 43:32.442
      - I know, but their
   motives are pretty thin.

43:32.518 --> 43:33.776
       I mean, I know I
       just met Walter,

43:33.928 --> 43:36.195
  but I trust what he's saying.

43:37.932 --> 43:39.616
  I know you don't believe me.

43:39.692 --> 43:42.619
     - If that's what you
     feel, I believe you.

43:42.770 --> 43:43.845
      I just don't think
       you should stick

43:43.863 --> 43:45.622
   your nose in his business.

43:45.698 --> 43:47.624
     It could get dangerous.

43:47.700 --> 43:49.459
     And he's got lawyers
        and detectives

43:49.610 --> 43:51.610
     that can help him get
   to the bottom of things.

43:51.630 --> 43:52.629
         (Audrey sighs)

43:52.780 --> 43:54.297
      - Maybe you're right.

43:54.448 --> 43:57.634
- And you can't let the team
know that you suspect anyone.

43:57.785 --> 44:00.470
  They could turn on you if
they know you're on his side.

44:00.621 --> 44:02.713
  - Yeah, but I don't think
    it's quite like that.

44:02.866 --> 44:04.974
    - There's an expression.

44:05.126 --> 44:06.976
      Guilt by association.

44:07.128 --> 44:09.053
      - I did Google Lou
        and he did have

44:09.205 --> 44:10.813
       an arrest record
     when he was younger.

44:10.965 --> 44:13.875
   - Audrey, just be careful.

44:13.893 --> 44:16.152
    How many times have I
   told you not to meddle?

44:17.138 --> 44:20.898
  - [Cassie] Pop, pop, in sync.

44:21.050 --> 44:21.716
        Come on, ladies.

44:21.734 --> 44:22.808
            Yes, yes.

44:22.827 --> 44:24.160
    That's it, that's what
      I'm talking about.

44:24.311 --> 44:25.720
       I love the smiles.

44:25.722 --> 44:26.478
          More of that.

44:26.498 --> 44:27.330
              Good.

44:28.816 --> 44:29.891
      That was late, Maria.

44:29.893 --> 44:32.484
         (upbeat music)

44:32.504 --> 44:34.745
 Feel it, big smiles all the way

44:34.898 --> 44:36.898
  to the back of the bleachers.

44:36.900 --> 44:38.174
              More.

44:38.251 --> 44:39.342
Eyes forward, feel that beat.
        (Nora groans)

44:39.493 --> 44:40.343
           Hair whip.

44:42.906 --> 44:43.930
         Pop, pop, pop.

44:46.851 --> 44:48.851
    I love it, good job, yes!

44:50.838 --> 44:53.189
  Shake it, shake it, shake it.

44:53.340 --> 44:54.691
           Hair whip.

44:56.936 --> 44:57.768
              Yes!

44:57.921 --> 44:58.861
   Watch the girl next to you.

45:00.106 --> 45:01.772
        Smiles for days.

45:01.925 --> 45:03.032
        Smiles for days.

45:03.868 --> 45:04.867
             Smooth.

45:05.019 --> 45:06.018
       I love it, ladies.

45:06.037 --> 45:07.186
             Great!

45:07.205 --> 45:08.930
Going again after a quick break.

45:08.948 --> 45:11.457
         (pensive music)

45:15.196 --> 45:17.880
- [Audrey] Wow, so you've been
 on the team for three years?

45:17.957 --> 45:19.716
    - Yeah, I just got lucky.

45:20.960 --> 45:23.035
     - You know, I heard
      that coach Cassie

45:23.054 --> 45:25.805
    and Bailey used to be
    friends last season.

45:27.300 --> 45:28.474
       - They used to be.

45:29.953 --> 45:31.894
    - Did anyone ever tell
      you what happened?

45:32.046 --> 45:34.564
   - Audrey, meet me outside.

45:34.715 --> 45:37.734
      (dancers chattering)

45:43.575 --> 45:44.723
      What did I tell you?

45:44.743 --> 45:45.908
     - To leave Tracy alone.

45:46.060 --> 45:47.243
  I tried to apologize to her.

45:47.394 --> 45:49.820
     - You're bringing up
  Bailey and the case again.

45:49.973 --> 45:50.988
 It's distracting you from what

45:51.140 --> 45:53.398
I need you to focus on which is?

45:53.418 --> 45:54.825
              Work.

45:54.978 --> 45:56.919
   - Maybe you should cut her.

45:57.071 --> 45:58.145
           - Excuse...

45:58.164 --> 45:58.921
         - You heard me.

45:59.073 --> 46:00.164
    It's not good for morale

46:00.316 --> 46:01.758
        to keep talkin'
     about what happened.

46:01.909 --> 46:03.667
     - The season starts
        in two weeks.

46:04.837 --> 46:07.764
     I need all you girls
   upbeat and entertaining.

46:08.992 --> 46:10.491
 How is that supposed to happen

46:10.510 --> 46:12.769
if you're constantly reminding
  them of Bailey and Walter?

46:12.920 --> 46:14.771
       - Well, I'm not
      reminding anyone.

46:14.847 --> 46:16.439
     It's all over the news.

46:16.590 --> 46:18.849
  - Exactly, you don't have to.

46:19.002 --> 46:20.943
   - You're the one dating
     Walter, aren't you?

46:22.188 --> 46:25.264
    - I mean, I wouldn't
   exactly call it dating.

46:25.283 --> 46:26.949
 - You're emotionally invested,

46:28.269 --> 46:30.936
    but don't let all this
  emotion ruin this for you.

46:30.955 --> 46:33.456
  - Yeah, but do you really
   think that he did this?

46:35.201 --> 46:36.867
        - Audrey, right?

46:37.020 --> 46:38.127
    I hate seeing this, too.

46:39.613 --> 46:40.630
      Walter was my friend.

46:42.041 --> 46:43.800
      I met him when he
       was in college.

46:44.969 --> 46:48.620
    - Well, guys, I think
     he's being framed.

46:48.640 --> 46:49.806
        - That's enough.

46:52.051 --> 46:53.142
       Do you understand?

46:55.038 --> 46:57.897
I need you to go out there and
 be a good little cheerleader.

47:00.043 --> 47:02.568
  And if you have any more
  problems, I will cut you.

47:04.564 --> 47:05.238
          - Yes, Ma'am.

47:06.491 --> 47:07.323
           Understood.

47:12.980 --> 47:13.830
           - Good job.

47:18.227 --> 47:20.002
         (upbeat music)

47:21.397 --> 47:23.898
   - Hi, I'm Audrey and I'm
  from Van Nuys, California,

47:23.916 --> 47:25.157
        well, the Valley,

47:25.176 --> 47:27.468
     and this is my first
  season as a Renegade Girl.

47:28.847 --> 47:30.304
     - Wow, she's a hot one.

47:32.091 --> 47:33.850
       If she wasn't so
      nosy (chuckles)...

47:34.001 --> 47:35.351
 - My favorite childhood memory

47:35.428 --> 47:38.095
      would be backyard
  barbecues with my family.

47:38.931 --> 47:40.598
 My favorite fictional character

47:40.750 --> 47:43.767
  is Miss Jane Marple from
 the Agatha Christie novels,

47:43.920 --> 47:45.920
    and my least favorite
        food is sushi

47:45.922 --> 47:47.179
      because if you're
       gonna eat fish,

47:47.198 --> 47:49.014
        it needs to be
      cooked (chuckles).

47:49.033 --> 47:50.032
         And that's me.

47:50.184 --> 47:51.033
           I'm Audrey.

47:51.110 --> 47:53.536
       (logo whooshing)
        (upbeat music)

47:53.687 --> 47:54.929
        - Hi, I'm Tracy.

47:54.931 --> 47:57.373
      I grew up in Salt
      Lake City, Utah,

47:57.524 --> 47:59.617
and my favorite Renegades moment

47:59.769 --> 48:03.195
    is actually getting the
  call that I made the team.

48:03.214 --> 48:05.606
  It took me three years to
  become a Renegades Girl,

48:05.608 --> 48:07.699
       so I literally
     cannot stop crying.

48:07.719 --> 48:08.959
    - Enjoy it while you can.

48:09.112 --> 48:10.461
        - But I'm still
      very excited to be

48:10.613 --> 48:13.038
a part of this team and I can't
wait to dance for the fans.

48:13.057 --> 48:14.891
         And that's me.

48:15.042 --> 48:16.208
           I'm Tracy.

48:16.227 --> 48:17.560
     - [Sportscaster] It's
    an exciting new season

48:17.711 --> 48:19.286
 for the Los Angeles Renegades.

48:19.305 --> 48:21.046
      As always, Renegade
   Girls will be available-

48:21.065 --> 48:22.640
       - There's some
    dinner in the fridge.

48:22.792 --> 48:23.900
  - [Sportscaster] Speaking
   engagements, endorsing-

48:23.976 --> 48:24.808
         - Yeah, thanks.

48:24.961 --> 48:26.235
 - I'm headed out for the night.

48:26.312 --> 48:27.570
 - [Sportscaster] For charity
   events like the Hope for

48:27.647 --> 48:28.738
a Brighter Future Foundation.
       - See ya later.

48:28.889 --> 48:30.297
            - Okay.
     - Have a good night.

48:30.316 --> 48:31.390
 - [Sportscaster] In addition
   to personal appearances,

48:31.409 --> 48:32.241
      for charity events
         - Goodnight.

48:32.393 --> 48:33.558
 - [Sportscaster] like the Hope

48:33.578 --> 48:34.577
        for a Brighter
      Future Foundation.

48:37.473 --> 48:40.824
        (buttons beeping)

48:40.977 --> 48:44.754
    - Tracy is not getting
    waited for any longer.

48:44.830 --> 48:46.422
      Victoria, will you
    please take her space?

48:46.573 --> 48:47.256
           Thank you.

48:47.333 --> 48:48.424
       Thank you so much.

48:48.501 --> 48:51.243
  Everybody in your formation.

48:51.262 --> 48:52.169
          Great, music.

48:52.321 --> 48:53.337
         (upbeat music)

48:53.489 --> 48:54.722
          From the top.

48:57.101 --> 48:58.509
   Let's take a slide routine.

48:58.661 --> 49:00.844
        This is a slide
  choreography ladies, yeah.

49:00.997 --> 49:02.104
     Your favorite, I know.

49:03.349 --> 49:04.065
           Here we go.

49:05.259 --> 49:06.183
            And push.

49:06.335 --> 49:08.277
          And oh, yes.

49:08.429 --> 49:09.946
   Watch the girl next to you.

49:10.022 --> 49:11.614
      (upbeat music fades)

49:11.691 --> 49:12.506
         (pensive music)

49:12.508 --> 49:14.283
     Good time, time, time.

49:16.103 --> 49:16.786
              Yes!

49:16.862 --> 49:19.455
         (pensive music)

49:21.200 --> 49:23.960
   - No, you can't be here.
      - Find your space.

49:24.036 --> 49:25.277
   Look to where you're going.

49:25.296 --> 49:29.632
   Yeah, you're holding it!
    - No, you're not real.

49:29.709 --> 49:31.525
 - [Cassie] Look like you're
having the time of your life.

49:31.544 --> 49:32.526
         - Are you okay?

49:32.545 --> 49:34.303
        - Look like it!
       - This can't be.

49:34.455 --> 49:35.471
   - [Audrey] Miss McConnell?

49:36.957 --> 49:38.808
      - Please, Bailey, no.

49:38.959 --> 49:40.309
       Bailey, no, please.

49:42.480 --> 49:43.813
             No.
      - Miss McConnell?

49:43.964 --> 49:45.982
             - No!
        (Audrey gasps)

49:46.058 --> 49:47.057
      - Are you all right?

49:47.210 --> 49:48.225
    - Good, break it away.
          - I'm fine.

49:48.377 --> 49:50.060
      - [Cassie] Show 'em
     you're working hard.

49:50.213 --> 49:51.729
      - Why aren't you
    with the other girls?

49:51.881 --> 49:54.215
      - Beautiful, turn.
   - I was in the bathroom.

49:54.233 --> 49:55.157
    - [Cassie] That was nice!

49:55.309 --> 49:56.050
        Good job, Maria.

49:56.068 --> 49:58.619
         (pensive music)

50:06.395 --> 50:07.503
         - I hate this.

50:09.248 --> 50:10.006
         I hate this!
    - I thought you wanted

50:10.157 --> 50:12.066
 to do something with your life

50:12.084 --> 50:15.252
 aside from dinners and parties.

50:15.404 --> 50:20.182
    - I am a front to your
     little indiscretions!

50:20.334 --> 50:22.685
What the hell is wrong with you?

50:23.670 --> 50:25.021
    I'm not doin' it anymore.

50:25.097 --> 50:27.023
       I'm not doin' it.
  - Calm down, Nora, please.

50:27.174 --> 50:30.359
      - Is this why you
    bought the team, huh?

50:31.270 --> 50:32.770
          These women?

50:32.922 --> 50:35.197
 They're all just your little
   prostitutes aren't they?

50:35.349 --> 50:37.682
     - What the hell are
     you talking about?

50:37.702 --> 50:42.705
   - You have been screwing
    bimbos left and right!

50:44.267 --> 50:48.026
    Six years ago with that
little Filipino girl, Jasmine.

50:48.046 --> 50:51.272
 And then you, then you were
  banging McKayla and Kiana

50:51.290 --> 50:53.382
    and then what's her name?

50:53.459 --> 50:54.216
             Raquel!

50:54.368 --> 50:55.109
          (Nora groans)

50:55.127 --> 50:56.052
              I...

50:57.555 --> 51:00.890
 - You haven't wanted to have
   sex with me for 15 years.

51:01.041 --> 51:05.186
     - Oh (chuckles), so
     now it's my fault?

51:06.713 --> 51:07.563
      - I'll tell you what.

51:09.625 --> 51:11.567
   I'll take the blame, okay?

51:13.129 --> 51:14.070
      You wanna divorce me?

51:15.907 --> 51:16.906
            Go ahead.

51:19.485 --> 51:20.634
       I didn't think so.

51:20.636 --> 51:21.410
              - Oh!

51:22.413 --> 51:23.487
     - I'll see you at home.

51:23.639 --> 51:24.914
        (dramatic music)

51:24.990 --> 51:25.915
         Oh, hey Bailey.

51:27.251 --> 51:28.900
    - Oh, is this a bad time?

51:28.920 --> 51:29.752
     - [Michael] Oh, no, no.

51:29.903 --> 51:31.145
We were just, just finishing up.

51:31.147 --> 51:32.313
      Why you need to talk?

51:32.331 --> 51:34.090
       - How long were
     you standing there?

51:34.241 --> 51:35.591
       - I just showed up.

51:35.742 --> 51:37.259
  I heard you guys shouting
     from down the hall.

51:38.838 --> 51:40.078
   - Were you recording that?

51:40.098 --> 51:41.672
         (pensive music)

51:41.824 --> 51:42.765
           - You were.

51:44.251 --> 51:46.102
      Why, you little,
     give me that phone!

51:46.178 --> 51:47.103
             Bailey!

51:48.255 --> 51:50.422
  Bailey, bring the phone back!

51:50.441 --> 51:51.348
         (air whooshing)

51:51.500 --> 51:55.277
       (Nora panting)
       (pensive music)

51:55.429 --> 51:57.596
     - Yes, can I speak to
  Detective Jameson, please?

51:57.615 --> 51:58.447
   - [Officer] Who's calling?

51:58.599 --> 52:00.265
   - This is Audrey Anderson.

52:00.284 --> 52:01.784
    He spoke to us about
   the Bailey West murder,

52:01.935 --> 52:03.935
said if we had any new
information to give him a call.

52:03.955 --> 52:05.454
- [Officer] Detective Jameson
  is not in at the moment.

52:05.531 --> 52:06.771
             - Okay.

52:06.791 --> 52:08.182
    Can you just tell him
   to give me a call then?

52:08.200 --> 52:09.183
     - [Officer] Yes, Ma'am.

52:09.201 --> 52:10.684
            - Thanks.

52:10.686 --> 52:15.631
      (engine rumbling)
       (pensive music)

52:24.216 --> 52:24.974
           - Michael?

52:27.036 --> 52:28.144
            Michael!

52:28.295 --> 52:30.721
       (Nora panting)
       (pensive music)

52:30.873 --> 52:32.039
              - Hi.

52:32.057 --> 52:33.874
      What are you doin'
        home so early?

52:33.893 --> 52:35.317
     - [Nora] Are you alone?

52:35.394 --> 52:36.134
             - Yeah.

52:36.154 --> 52:38.154
     - Oh my God, I'm sorry.

52:39.398 --> 52:41.490
      I don't know what
       to, what to do.

52:41.642 --> 52:42.658
          I can't deal

52:42.735 --> 52:43.400
      with this anymore.
            - Okay,

52:43.552 --> 52:44.827
    well, what's the matter?

52:44.978 --> 52:49.498
      - The blackmailing,
  Bailey, that stupid video.

52:51.002 --> 52:53.335
  If the police find it, oh
  God, it could destroy us.

52:53.412 --> 52:54.728
            - I know.

52:54.730 --> 52:56.079
      Let's not do this
      right now, okay?

52:56.232 --> 52:57.840
        - We could be
    implicated in murder!

52:57.991 --> 53:01.326
  - Nora, calm down, please.
 - I don't want to calm down.

53:01.345 --> 53:04.180
      Please, don't tell
       me to calm down.

53:05.516 --> 53:07.591
 I need you to help me, damn it!

53:07.743 --> 53:10.186
   You're the reason why we
   got into this situation.

53:11.747 --> 53:13.914
   That new girl, Audrey,
 she's been asking questions

53:13.916 --> 53:15.766
and I think she knows something.

53:15.918 --> 53:17.342
     - [Michael] All right.

53:17.361 --> 53:19.195
   Let's go outside, we'll
     get some fresh air.

53:19.271 --> 53:20.345
       It's gonna be fine.

53:20.364 --> 53:22.347
     - [Nora] No, I don't
       wanna go outside!

53:22.366 --> 53:24.366
     It's not gonna be okay!

53:24.443 --> 53:25.275
       - [Michael] Relax!

53:25.428 --> 53:26.368
 - [Nora] What is your problem!

53:27.930 --> 53:30.372
 She heard me say Bailey's name.

53:31.784 --> 53:34.543
      Michael, I've been
    having episodes again.

53:34.695 --> 53:36.212
      I'm having episodes.

53:37.381 --> 53:38.605
    Did you hear me, Michael?

53:38.624 --> 53:41.383
       - Nora be quiet.
    - I think I need help.

53:41.535 --> 53:43.293
    - You're fine, please.
  - I don't know what to do.

53:43.446 --> 53:44.869
       - Just breathe.
   - It's happening again!

53:44.889 --> 53:47.389
        - Calm down.
    - Let me go, Michael!

53:47.541 --> 53:48.724
            - Here.
          - Help me!

53:49.785 --> 53:51.227
         (Tracy groans)

53:51.303 --> 53:52.286
           - Stop.
       - Let go of me.

53:52.304 --> 53:55.806
      (table clattering)
         (Nora gasps)

53:55.958 --> 53:58.308
         (Tracy gasping)

53:58.461 --> 54:00.402
          - Oh my God.

54:00.554 --> 54:01.737
         - Who is that?

54:01.888 --> 54:03.388
       - I don't know,
      it's just the TV.

54:03.407 --> 54:04.907
        - No it was not!

54:05.058 --> 54:05.816
           Who's here?

54:05.968 --> 54:07.409
   - Nora, wait, please, Nora!

54:07.561 --> 54:12.414
       (dramatic music)
        (Tracy gasping)

54:13.142 --> 54:13.824
              - Oh.

54:13.976 --> 54:16.418
         (Tracy gasping)

54:16.570 --> 54:18.903
       - I didn't expect
     you home this early.

54:18.923 --> 54:20.422
         (Nora exhales)

54:20.574 --> 54:21.498
 - Nora, he said the two of you

54:21.650 --> 54:24.093
  were in a open relationship.

54:28.582 --> 54:30.099
          - She heard.

54:30.250 --> 54:32.083
- No I didn't and even if I did,

54:32.103 --> 54:34.419
   I swear I would not say
    anything, I promise.

54:34.438 --> 54:35.437
            - Jesus.

54:37.666 --> 54:39.275
 - Look, maybe I should just go.

54:39.426 --> 54:41.184
      I'm just gonna go.
    - No, no, no, hold it.

54:41.337 --> 54:44.187
    Hold it, I just need,
    I just need to think.

54:44.340 --> 54:45.856
    - Stay right where you
     are, do you hear me?

54:46.008 --> 54:47.841
        - Just let me
     think for a second.

54:47.860 --> 54:50.119
    - Look, I can call Harry.

54:50.270 --> 54:52.103
    We can put together a
  non-disclosure agreement.

54:52.123 --> 54:52.955
              - No.

54:53.106 --> 54:55.457
Michael, we can't let her leave.

54:55.534 --> 54:57.851
  - You'll be destroyed, you
say one word about this Tracy-

54:57.870 --> 54:59.611
    - Okay, I won't, I won't.

54:59.630 --> 55:01.463
        - No, no lawyers!

55:01.615 --> 55:03.190
      - Please, I'm sorry!

55:03.208 --> 55:04.133
    - [Nora] Oh no you don't!

55:04.209 --> 55:04.967
           Come here!

55:06.453 --> 55:07.970
       - [Tracy] No, wait!

55:08.047 --> 55:09.788
   No, Nora, stop, please!
 - Get away from the stairs!

55:09.807 --> 55:10.806
            - Please!

55:10.883 --> 55:12.141
           Help me!
            - Nora!

55:12.217 --> 55:13.534
       - Nora, please!
           - Stop!

55:13.552 --> 55:14.551
        - Nora, please!
       - Let go of her!

55:14.703 --> 55:15.978
   - Please don't do this!
        - Nora, stop!

55:16.129 --> 55:16.870
         - Please stop!

55:16.889 --> 55:18.147
              No!
           - Tracy!

55:18.223 --> 55:23.152
       (Tracy thudding)
       (dramatic music)

55:24.471 --> 55:29.158
       (pensive music)
     (crickets chirping)

55:31.220 --> 55:32.661
      I can't believe this.

55:34.481 --> 55:35.906
      I can't believe this!

55:36.058 --> 55:37.833
     - This is what your
    cheating has created.

55:37.910 --> 55:39.076
           - Shut up.

55:39.228 --> 55:44.173
       (pensive music)
     (crickets chirping)

55:47.511 --> 55:50.754
         (phone ringing)

55:50.906 --> 55:52.831
     I need to figure out
    the right thing to do.

55:52.850 --> 55:54.424
              - No.

55:54.577 --> 55:56.643
   We need to figure out a
   way to cover our asses.

55:57.930 --> 56:02.858
      (phone vibrating)
       (pensive music)

56:05.604 --> 56:07.087
   - [Tracy] Hey, it's Tracy.

56:07.089 --> 56:07.938
      Leave a message.
      (voicemail beeps)

56:08.090 --> 56:10.366
      - Tracy, it's Audrey.

56:10.517 --> 56:12.534
   I'm sure you don't wanna
    hear from me right now,

56:12.686 --> 56:16.187
   but I just wanted to say
  I'm sorry for what I said.

56:16.207 --> 56:19.099
I didn't mean to hurt your
feelings or ruin our friendship.

56:19.101 --> 56:22.786
 I was just upset about Walter,

56:22.938 --> 56:25.214
but that's not really an excuse.

56:25.365 --> 56:28.550
      Anyways, I just, I
     hope you understand.

56:29.887 --> 56:32.054
 Okay, I'll see you at practice.

56:34.617 --> 56:35.949
         (phone clicks)

56:35.968 --> 56:38.560
         (pensive music)

56:41.882 --> 56:42.898
          (Nora sighs)

56:45.886 --> 56:47.477
         (pensive music)

56:47.630 --> 56:48.962
   - [Greg] It looks like
  the Los Angeles Renegades

56:48.981 --> 56:52.241
  are gonna start the season
  without their point guard,

56:52.392 --> 56:54.743
  Walter James, which could
    cripple them mightily

56:54.820 --> 56:57.913
when they battle for the top
spot in the Western Conference.

56:58.064 --> 57:01.750
And that's it for "Sportswatch"
this morning at 5:24 a.m.

57:01.902 --> 57:03.419
      I'm Greg Karathanas.

57:03.570 --> 57:06.980
Now it's back to Marc Bakerman,
"Marc in the Morning!"

57:06.999 --> 57:09.591
    For today's headline
  news be sure to check in-

57:09.668 --> 57:12.428
         (keys jingling)

57:17.326 --> 57:20.084
         (gate clanging)

57:20.104 --> 57:23.439
         (pensive music)

57:23.590 --> 57:26.108
        (dramatic music)

57:28.170 --> 57:29.670
 - Lou discovered her body early

57:29.672 --> 57:31.521
this morning in the parking lot.

57:32.766 --> 57:35.117
  The police found a suicide
      note in her things.

57:37.680 --> 57:38.603
     Apparently she jumped.

57:38.622 --> 57:40.939
         (solemn music)

57:40.958 --> 57:42.291
     I know this is a shock.

57:43.944 --> 57:45.294
 We have a grief counselor here,

57:45.445 --> 57:48.021
     if anybody needs to
     talk and as always

57:48.023 --> 57:50.207
      my door and Nora's
       are open to you.

57:50.359 --> 57:53.469
    (dancers sobbing softly)

57:53.620 --> 57:57.473
Does anybody have anything they
wanna say or any questions?

57:58.792 --> 58:00.809
     - Yeah, how did she
     get to the rooftop?

58:00.886 --> 58:01.643
       - They didn't say.

58:03.147 --> 58:05.647
    - But she wasn't even
   at practice last night.

58:05.799 --> 58:07.608
      - We just don't know.

58:10.562 --> 58:12.654
This is about as bad as it gets.

58:14.066 --> 58:16.992
   It's horrible and I just
    hope we get through it.

58:18.554 --> 58:20.329
    Bailey and Tracy would
  want us to get through it.

58:21.406 --> 58:22.331
       That's all for now.

58:24.317 --> 58:25.408
          How was that?

58:25.561 --> 58:26.226
      - [Nora] (sighs)
     You did a good job.

58:26.245 --> 58:28.486
         (phone ringing)

58:28.506 --> 58:29.579
            - Hello?

58:29.732 --> 58:30.672
     - [Nora] She asked
     a lot of questions.

58:30.749 --> 58:31.489
  - Oh, hey Detective Jameson.

58:31.509 --> 58:32.733
        - We should keep

58:32.735 --> 58:33.509
       an eye on her.
     - Thank you so much

58:33.660 --> 58:34.918
  for returning my phone call.

58:35.070 --> 58:36.512
  Yeah, I think I have some
   information on Bailey.

58:40.592 --> 58:41.332
      - [Michael] Hey, Lou.

58:41.352 --> 58:42.242
        - Mr. McConnell.

58:42.261 --> 58:43.977
     Hi, how can I help you?

58:44.930 --> 58:45.812
       - You got a minute?

58:46.765 --> 58:47.689
            - Mm hm.

58:48.751 --> 58:50.025
    - Such a beautiful girl.

58:52.696 --> 58:54.196
    You really cared for her.

58:55.274 --> 58:56.031
            - I did.

58:57.426 --> 58:59.159
  She was always so nice to me.

59:00.763 --> 59:05.282
  Mean to everyone else but
   (sighs), so nice to me.

59:05.951 --> 59:06.500
     - You were good to her.

59:09.438 --> 59:10.937
   - I still can't believe
      that Walter James

59:10.939 --> 59:13.715
     would do such a thing.

59:13.867 --> 59:16.051
     - I have a hard time
    imagining that myself.

59:19.223 --> 59:20.389
        I need your help.

59:21.541 --> 59:22.632
           - Anything.

59:22.785 --> 59:24.117
           What is it?

59:24.136 --> 59:26.228
     - I've got a problem
    with one of the girls.

59:27.289 --> 59:27.896
     - What kind of problem?

59:28.048 --> 59:29.306
        - A big problem.

59:29.458 --> 59:31.066
         (pensive music)

59:31.143 --> 59:32.642
      It's the kind of
    problem that you used

59:32.795 --> 59:36.738
 to take care of back in Jersey.

59:38.742 --> 59:40.725
     - I don't know what
    you're talkin' about.

59:40.744 --> 59:41.743
         - Yeah, you do.

59:43.730 --> 59:44.805
   - That was a long time ago.

59:44.823 --> 59:45.706
        I didn't do that.

59:47.251 --> 59:48.083
         I don't know...

59:49.903 --> 59:50.644
         - Have a seat.

59:50.662 --> 59:52.921
         (pensive music)

01:00:01.156 --> 01:00:02.764
      I've always been
     good to you, right?

01:00:04.435 --> 01:00:07.585
   When your brother called,
  asked if I could help out,

01:00:07.605 --> 01:00:08.845
        did it hesitate?

01:00:08.997 --> 01:00:10.347
              - No.

01:00:10.499 --> 01:00:12.274
    - Got you out of trouble.

01:00:12.425 --> 01:00:14.401
    I gave you a job when
     nobody else would.

01:00:15.762 --> 01:00:17.261
     I got ya clean, right?

01:00:17.281 --> 01:00:19.114
      - Yeah, you gave
      me a fresh start.

01:00:20.843 --> 01:00:22.025
 And you know, I'm grateful but-

01:00:22.102 --> 01:00:24.453
   - Have I ever asked you
   to do anything for me?

01:00:24.529 --> 01:00:27.013
           (Lou sighs)

01:00:27.015 --> 01:00:27.789
              - No.

01:00:31.703 --> 01:00:32.794
      - You do this for me,

01:00:34.706 --> 01:00:36.798
   I'll get you more money
   than you could imagine.

01:00:36.875 --> 01:00:38.692
           (Lou sighs)

01:00:38.710 --> 01:00:40.761
     You always wanted to
     go to Mexico, right?

01:00:41.713 --> 01:00:42.696
           - Sure did.

01:00:42.714 --> 01:00:44.640
    - That's where you'll go.

01:00:44.791 --> 01:00:47.809
      I'll get you on a
     plane, first class.

01:00:49.037 --> 01:00:50.479
         Great vacation.

01:00:51.874 --> 01:00:53.607
      They got beautiful
       women down there.

01:00:55.210 --> 01:00:59.988
 Early retirement from all this.

01:01:02.401 --> 01:01:02.991
          - Aw, Jesus.

01:01:06.330 --> 01:01:07.829
        She must be one
      hell of a problem.

01:01:10.834 --> 01:01:11.574
            - She is.

01:01:11.727 --> 01:01:14.836
         (pensive music)

01:01:14.988 --> 01:01:15.837
          - Who is it?

01:01:18.509 --> 01:01:19.675
        - Oh, this is me.

01:01:21.161 --> 01:01:22.919
    - [Ride Share Driver]
    This is a cute house.

01:01:23.997 --> 01:01:27.757
     All right, here you
     go, safe and sound.

01:01:27.910 --> 01:01:30.686
         (phone ringing)

01:01:31.671 --> 01:01:32.854
          - Thank you.

01:01:33.006 --> 01:01:33.980
     - [Ride Share Driver]
   Thanks, have a good one.

01:01:35.767 --> 01:01:36.525
            - Hello?

01:01:37.861 --> 01:01:39.436
        Yeah, who's this?

01:01:39.588 --> 01:01:40.862
        - Nora McConnell.

01:01:41.865 --> 01:01:43.699
    - Oh, hey Miss McConnell.

01:01:44.702 --> 01:01:46.017
         - Nora, please.

01:01:46.036 --> 01:01:48.853
   Audrey, I know you were
     friends with Tracy.

01:01:48.872 --> 01:01:50.188
          - Well, yeah.

01:01:50.207 --> 01:01:52.374
    - Well, we're putting
   together and decorating

01:01:52.451 --> 01:01:53.950
       a Memorial for her.

01:01:54.102 --> 01:01:55.377
 You know, I really hate to ask,

01:01:55.528 --> 01:01:58.004
      but I could really
        use your help.

01:01:59.032 --> 01:02:00.457
           - Oh, sure.

01:02:00.609 --> 01:02:01.550
      When do you need me?

01:02:01.701 --> 01:02:03.201
           - Tonight?

01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:04.386
             - Okay.

01:02:04.537 --> 01:02:06.722
    Let me ask my mom if
    I can borrow the car.

01:02:06.873 --> 01:02:08.539
       - That'd be great.

01:02:08.559 --> 01:02:10.559
    - Sure thing, Miss, Nora.

01:02:10.710 --> 01:02:11.560
      You can count on me.

01:02:12.955 --> 01:02:14.045
        - Thanks, Audrey.

01:02:14.064 --> 01:02:16.898
         (pensive music)

01:02:38.071 --> 01:02:39.829
         (door latches)

01:02:39.982 --> 01:02:41.381
        - Miss McConnell?

01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:45.594
              Nora?

01:02:48.766 --> 01:02:49.598
         Miss McConnell?

01:02:51.935 --> 01:02:54.752
         (pensive music)

01:02:54.772 --> 01:02:55.604
             Hello?

01:03:02.112 --> 01:03:03.003
         Miss McConnell?

01:03:03.021 --> 01:03:05.781
         (pensive music)

01:03:17.628 --> 01:03:18.852
         Miss McConnell?

01:03:18.870 --> 01:03:21.421
         (pensive music)

01:04:10.163 --> 01:04:13.740
     (door handle rattling)

01:04:13.758 --> 01:04:14.924
         (door creaking)

01:04:15.077 --> 01:04:15.851
          (door slams)

01:04:16.002 --> 01:04:17.501
        (Audrey gasps)
         (eerie music)

01:04:17.521 --> 01:04:19.020
        Is someone there?

01:04:20.749 --> 01:04:21.356
             Hello?

01:04:22.767 --> 01:04:27.696
        (Audrey gasps)
         (eerie music)

01:04:30.775 --> 01:04:32.775
        (Audrey exhales)

01:04:32.928 --> 01:04:35.495
         (pensive music)

01:04:49.961 --> 01:04:50.719
             Hello?

01:04:52.890 --> 01:04:53.963
         Anyone in here?

01:04:54.116 --> 01:04:56.850
         (pensive music)

01:05:30.594 --> 01:05:31.927
         (door creaking)

01:05:32.078 --> 01:05:34.596
          (eerie music)

01:05:38.176 --> 01:05:39.509
       (shutter clicking)

01:05:39.661 --> 01:05:42.103
         (pensive music)

01:05:46.184 --> 01:05:49.110
       (dramatic music)
       (Audrey gasping)

01:05:49.187 --> 01:05:50.612
       You killed Bailey.

01:05:52.524 --> 01:05:53.189
           Tracy, too?

01:05:53.341 --> 01:05:55.341
      - No, it's not right.

01:05:55.360 --> 01:05:59.529
        (Lou grunting)
       (Audrey screams)

01:05:59.681 --> 01:06:00.789
       (Audrey choking)
       (dramatic music)

01:06:00.940 --> 01:06:02.198
      I could never have
     done that to Bailey.

01:06:02.350 --> 01:06:03.199
          I loved her.

01:06:03.351 --> 01:06:05.961
       (Audrey gasping)
       (dramatic music)

01:06:06.112 --> 01:06:06.962
               No!

01:06:07.113 --> 01:06:08.296
           I'm sorry.

01:06:08.448 --> 01:06:09.947
           I'm sorry!

01:06:09.967 --> 01:06:10.781
        (Audrey gasping)

01:06:10.801 --> 01:06:12.375
        (heels clacking)

01:06:12.527 --> 01:06:13.209
        (wrench thuds)
         (Lou grunts)

01:06:13.361 --> 01:06:15.028
        (Audrey gasping)

01:06:15.046 --> 01:06:18.456
     (wrench clattering)
       (pensive music)

01:06:18.475 --> 01:06:19.265
         - Are you okay?

01:06:21.052 --> 01:06:21.718
              Yeah?

01:06:21.870 --> 01:06:24.145
        (Audrey gasping)

01:06:24.297 --> 01:06:25.146
      - [Paramedic] Just
     some light bruising.

01:06:25.223 --> 01:06:26.797
         You'll be fine.

01:06:26.817 --> 01:06:29.818
        - Audrey, Audrey!

01:06:29.969 --> 01:06:31.486
      - Yeah, we're just
       glad she's okay.

01:06:31.563 --> 01:06:33.321
   (police scanner chattering)

01:06:33.473 --> 01:06:34.731
    - I'm Michael McConnell.

01:06:34.883 --> 01:06:35.732
     This is my wife, Nora.

01:06:35.884 --> 01:06:36.716
              - Hi.

01:06:36.718 --> 01:06:38.660
- Thank you for saving her life.

01:06:38.811 --> 01:06:40.144
          - Of course.

01:06:40.163 --> 01:06:42.813
   I just can't believe Lou
 would do anything like this.

01:06:42.833 --> 01:06:47.669
      (gurney rattling)
       (pensive music)

01:06:47.746 --> 01:06:50.505
   (police scanner chattering)

01:06:50.656 --> 01:06:54.175
- Well, this case is startin'
 to look pretty cut and dry.

01:06:54.252 --> 01:06:55.677
            - How so?

01:06:55.754 --> 01:06:57.420
  - Well, we have to wait for
 a final report from the lab,

01:06:57.572 --> 01:06:59.347
 but it seems that your janitor

01:06:59.424 --> 01:07:02.350
       has been involved
    with multiple murders.

01:07:02.502 --> 01:07:04.093
           - Oh, God.

01:07:04.246 --> 01:07:06.688
  - Turns out that he had an
  extensive criminal record.

01:07:06.839 --> 01:07:10.341
There were no witnesses when
he found Tracy Larson's body.

01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:12.193
      We found more than
        a dozen photos

01:07:12.345 --> 01:07:15.088
       of Bailey West in
     some bizarre shrine.

01:07:15.106 --> 01:07:17.440
      Now, he's clearly
      obsessed with her

01:07:17.592 --> 01:07:21.036
   and tonight he tried to
   strangle Miss Anderson.

01:07:21.112 --> 01:07:23.687
       Same MO as Bailey.

01:07:23.707 --> 01:07:27.116
   It appears that he tried
    to frame Walter James,

01:07:27.269 --> 01:07:30.045
    as he had access to his
  jersey with his DNA on it.

01:07:31.456 --> 01:07:34.107
     Audrey, you're lucky
      that Miss McConnell

01:07:34.125 --> 01:07:36.051
     showed up when she did.

01:07:36.202 --> 01:07:37.460
          - Thank you.

01:07:37.612 --> 01:07:38.553
          - Of course.

01:07:40.448 --> 01:07:42.706
       - Come on, let's
     get you out of here.

01:07:42.726 --> 01:07:47.804
       (solemn music)
 (police scanner chattering)

01:07:48.565 --> 01:07:50.047
 - I'm just so glad you're okay.

01:07:50.067 --> 01:07:55.070
       (solemn music)
 (police scanner chattering)

01:08:04.581 --> 01:08:08.750
     (alcohol splashing)
       (pensive music)

01:08:12.664 --> 01:08:13.588
      The police are gone.

01:08:13.739 --> 01:08:14.881
      Are you ready to go?

01:08:16.242 --> 01:08:18.218
     - We just framed Lou
     for Bailey's murder,

01:08:19.671 --> 01:08:21.261
   and I know he didn't do it.

01:08:21.413 --> 01:08:22.596
       - What do you care?

01:08:22.747 --> 01:08:24.765
   You're getting your star
    basketball player back.

01:08:26.344 --> 01:08:29.938
        - I used Lou to
     save you from Tracy.

01:08:31.015 --> 01:08:31.680
           - Save me?

01:08:31.832 --> 01:08:32.439
             - Yes.

01:08:33.426 --> 01:08:36.002
 Save you from a murder charge.

01:08:36.020 --> 01:08:38.613
         You let her go.

01:08:38.764 --> 01:08:40.173
  You deliberately killed her.

01:08:40.191 --> 01:08:42.283
   Get away from the stairs!
  - Nora, please, I'm sorry!

01:08:42.359 --> 01:08:43.509
           I'm sorry!

01:08:43.528 --> 01:08:44.618
    Please don't do this!
        - Nora, stop!

01:08:44.770 --> 01:08:46.453
     - Please, I'm sorry!
            - Stop!

01:08:46.531 --> 01:08:48.197
             - Help!

01:08:48.350 --> 01:08:49.607
       (air whooshing)
       (pensive music)

01:08:49.626 --> 01:08:50.416
             - Yeah.

01:08:51.777 --> 01:08:55.462
So, it's your word against mine.

01:08:58.301 --> 01:08:59.542
            - Really?

01:08:59.694 --> 01:09:01.861
     - I wasn't the one
 sleeping with her, Michael.

01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:03.763
       - So you thought
     you should kill her?

01:09:05.533 --> 01:09:06.808
    Let's talk about Bailey.

01:09:08.145 --> 01:09:09.702
    She's had you in a panic.

01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:10.961
         (air whooshing)

01:09:10.981 --> 01:09:13.372
      - Did you send the
       video to anyone?

01:09:13.375 --> 01:09:14.149
              - No.

01:09:15.134 --> 01:09:15.817
       - What do you want?

01:09:15.968 --> 01:09:18.728
       - $1,000,000 cash.

01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:21.564
      - Oh (chuckles),
   honey, you're dreaming.

01:09:21.716 --> 01:09:22.881
           - Dreaming?

01:09:22.901 --> 01:09:24.783
       It's more like a
     nightmare, isn't it?

01:09:25.904 --> 01:09:27.162
        The Board of
    Directors would force

01:09:27.313 --> 01:09:28.888
  the McConnell's out so fast.

01:09:28.907 --> 01:09:31.166
       You and Michael
     would lose big time

01:09:31.242 --> 01:09:35.243
    and most likely he'll
   divorce your sorry ass,

01:09:35.397 --> 01:09:37.337
   and you, you'd get nothing.

01:09:38.675 --> 01:09:39.582
       - That's not true.

01:09:39.734 --> 01:09:41.009
        - Oh, yes it is.

01:09:41.085 --> 01:09:42.402
   When you guys got married,

01:09:42.420 --> 01:09:44.345
        your prenup was
      all over the news.

01:09:44.497 --> 01:09:45.755
          So yes, Nora.

01:09:45.907 --> 01:09:50.852
     If he dumps you, you
    get zip, diddly, nada.

01:09:51.763 --> 01:09:56.149
       (Bailey laughs)
       (pensive music)

01:09:57.194 --> 01:09:59.360
         (air whooshing)

01:09:59.437 --> 01:10:01.270
   - You've stopped taking
   your pills haven't you?

01:10:01.423 --> 01:10:02.530
    - What does that matter?

01:10:02.682 --> 01:10:04.699
    - Oh, I should've known
   this from the beginning.

01:10:04.850 --> 01:10:08.369
  You've been manic, you've
    been having episodes.

01:10:10.281 --> 01:10:11.931
       You're the one
     that killed Bailey.

01:10:11.950 --> 01:10:15.043
       (air whooshing)
       (pensive music)

01:10:15.119 --> 01:10:18.195
  - Bailey, I swear to God if
you sent that video to anyone-

01:10:18.215 --> 01:10:19.605
          - Okay, stop.

01:10:19.624 --> 01:10:21.382
     I don't want to talk
      about this anymore.

01:10:22.535 --> 01:10:23.443
      So, have you got it?

01:10:23.461 --> 01:10:26.221
         (pensive music)

01:10:27.298 --> 01:10:28.781
              Good.

01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:30.391
     Let's just take care
     of this super quick,

01:10:30.543 --> 01:10:32.209
  then you can get out of here.

01:10:32.229 --> 01:10:34.896
          (eerie music)

01:10:36.474 --> 01:10:41.402
       (Bailey choking)
       (dramatic music)

01:10:47.469 --> 01:10:48.743
         (Bailey thuds)

01:10:48.894 --> 01:10:51.537
        (dramatic music)

01:10:56.327 --> 01:10:58.419
   - Where is it, where is it?

01:10:58.496 --> 01:10:59.420
          Where is it?

01:10:59.497 --> 01:11:02.048
         (pensive music)

01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:05.409
         (air whooshing)

01:11:05.428 --> 01:11:08.930
    You should thank me for
 cleaning up your dirty work.

01:11:09.007 --> 01:11:10.265
   - So, you got away with it?

01:11:11.434 --> 01:11:14.327
     You didn't find that
    video though, did you?

01:11:14.329 --> 01:11:16.271
        - No one's come
     forward with it yet.

01:11:18.108 --> 01:11:23.111
      Now, thanks to Lou,
    case is all closed up.

01:11:23.947 --> 01:11:25.280
    - This is so wrong, Nora.

01:11:26.432 --> 01:11:29.675
You have taken this way too far.

01:11:29.677 --> 01:11:31.027
      - If it wasn't clear?

01:11:31.179 --> 01:11:33.621
         (pensive music)

01:11:35.533 --> 01:11:37.292
     You try to turn me in,

01:11:38.795 --> 01:11:40.795
   I'll take you down with me.

01:11:46.303 --> 01:11:47.468
     Come on, let's go home.

01:11:49.121 --> 01:11:49.879
        (Michael scoffs)

01:11:50.031 --> 01:11:52.473
         (pensive music)

01:11:54.536 --> 01:11:55.885
 - [Reporter] Sports fans around

01:11:55.961 --> 01:11:57.795
  the world are celebrating
this morning as Walter James,

01:11:57.814 --> 01:12:00.373
   the star point guard of
  the Los Angeles Renegades

01:12:00.391 --> 01:12:02.150
 has been cleared of all charges

01:12:02.301 --> 01:12:04.226
  in the murder of Bailey West.

01:12:04.379 --> 01:12:06.970
     Police responded late
  last evening to a 911 call

01:12:06.990 --> 01:12:08.489
 from the Renegade facility.
       (horn honking)

01:12:08.566 --> 01:12:09.824
 There, they discovered the body

01:12:09.975 --> 01:12:12.327
     of another Renegade
     facility employee.

01:12:12.403 --> 01:12:13.903
     Police believe the
    eyewitness statements

01:12:14.055 --> 01:12:15.555
     from those involved
        in the attack

01:12:15.557 --> 01:12:18.407
    and other key evidence
     found at the scene...

01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:21.169
         (gentle music)

01:12:29.012 --> 01:12:34.015
       (Audrey squeals)
        (Walter laughs)

01:12:34.517 --> 01:12:36.092
         (Audrey sighs)

01:12:36.244 --> 01:12:38.519
 - I mean, I realize I should
 be relieved and happy but...

01:12:38.596 --> 01:12:40.337
           - But what?

01:12:40.357 --> 01:12:43.524
   - It's just that Lou, I
think he was gonna let me go.

01:12:44.586 --> 01:12:46.027
    - Why do you think that?

01:12:46.104 --> 01:12:48.679
  - Well, right before I was
about to pass out, he stopped.

01:12:48.698 --> 01:12:50.514
         He released me.

01:12:50.533 --> 01:12:51.366
       He couldn't do it.

01:12:53.036 --> 01:12:54.443
             - What?

01:12:54.596 --> 01:12:55.428
            Whoa.
         - And also,

01:12:55.446 --> 01:12:56.762
 I don't think he killed Bailey.

01:12:56.764 --> 01:12:57.872
      He said he loved her.

01:12:59.525 --> 01:13:01.376
  - So wait, you think the
  killer's still out there?

01:13:02.879 --> 01:13:03.669
             - I do.

01:13:04.939 --> 01:13:07.548
        - So, who, then?

01:13:07.700 --> 01:13:11.627
- I don't know, but I do think
 the McConnell's are involved.

01:13:11.779 --> 01:13:13.112
        (Audrey knocking)

01:13:13.131 --> 01:13:15.681
         (pensive music)

01:13:46.314 --> 01:13:48.589
          (eerie music)

01:13:50.593 --> 01:13:53.428
         (pensive music)

01:13:57.583 --> 01:14:00.176
        (pills rattling)

01:14:00.328 --> 01:14:01.010
           Imipramine.

01:14:01.162 --> 01:14:03.604
         (pensive music)

01:14:03.681 --> 01:14:06.441
  "Delusions, Nora McConnell."

01:14:06.517 --> 01:14:07.442
         (air whooshing)

01:14:07.518 --> 01:14:10.570
      (dancers chattering)

01:14:12.023 --> 01:14:12.763
    - [Dancer] Let's talk
     about girl's night.

01:14:12.782 --> 01:14:15.432
         (Nora panting)

01:14:15.452 --> 01:14:16.451
        - Stop it, stop.

01:14:16.602 --> 01:14:17.410
           Stop, stop.

01:14:21.532 --> 01:14:22.457
            Stop it.

01:14:22.533 --> 01:14:23.532
         (air whooshing)

01:14:23.685 --> 01:14:24.366
          - That's it.

01:14:24.519 --> 01:14:26.852
         (pensive music)

01:14:26.871 --> 01:14:27.628
            - Audrey.

01:14:31.209 --> 01:14:32.467
   What are you doin' in here?

01:14:34.954 --> 01:14:36.637
- I was just grabbing something.

01:14:36.714 --> 01:14:40.049
         (pensive music)

01:14:40.201 --> 01:14:41.642
           Okay, wait.

01:14:43.462 --> 01:14:44.645
          Look at this.

01:14:45.890 --> 01:14:48.483
     And did you know that
    Nora is on medication?

01:14:49.468 --> 01:14:50.710
That she suffers from delusions?

01:14:50.712 --> 01:14:52.394
    - You're up to it again.

01:14:52.547 --> 01:14:53.488
          I warned you.

01:14:53.639 --> 01:14:55.156
     - Lou stopped, Cassie.

01:14:56.308 --> 01:14:57.492
     He stopped choking me.

01:14:57.568 --> 01:14:59.660
   He whispered in my ear,
    he said he was sorry.

01:14:59.737 --> 01:15:02.497
   It was like, he couldn't
      go through with it.

01:15:03.741 --> 01:15:06.834
      It was like he was
   being forced to kill me.

01:15:06.911 --> 01:15:08.318
   - So, what are you saying?

01:15:08.338 --> 01:15:10.171
      Nora had something
        to do with it?

01:15:10.248 --> 01:15:14.066
- I don't know, but Lou loved
  Bailey and you know that.

01:15:14.085 --> 01:15:14.842
             - Yeah.

01:15:16.254 --> 01:15:18.495
    Lou was a tough guy,
    but he was sensitive.

01:15:18.515 --> 01:15:19.739
    He always was good to me.

01:15:19.741 --> 01:15:23.017
        - Then how, why
     would Lou take Tracy

01:15:23.168 --> 01:15:26.312
     to the rooftop just
      to throw her off?

01:15:30.026 --> 01:15:31.692
         - I don't know.

01:15:31.844 --> 01:15:34.695
     - Michael and Nora
    are hiding something.

01:15:36.591 --> 01:15:37.365
         - Yeah, maybe.

01:15:38.776 --> 01:15:41.202
      Listen, those two
    have big time issues,

01:15:42.372 --> 01:15:43.538
       and something's
    definitely not right,

01:15:43.689 --> 01:15:45.689
      but I'm trying to
     protect a job here.

01:15:46.784 --> 01:15:50.770
  Nora and Michael, they're
     rich and powerful.

01:15:50.772 --> 01:15:52.880
      What are we going
       to possibly do?

01:15:52.957 --> 01:15:56.384
 - Maybe we could do what's
 right for Tracy and Bailey.

01:15:58.203 --> 01:16:01.722
   I have an idea, but I'm
    gonna need your help.

01:16:04.644 --> 01:16:06.543
      take your seats.

01:16:06.563 --> 01:16:08.378
     The press conference
       is now starting.

01:16:08.398 --> 01:16:12.141
     (reporters chattering)

01:16:12.293 --> 01:16:14.051
       - I hope you know
      what you're doin'.

01:16:14.070 --> 01:16:14.819
         - Me too, Mom.

01:16:16.647 --> 01:16:18.221
  - It is such a great tragedy

01:16:18.241 --> 01:16:20.866
      that has befallen
      our organization.

01:16:22.136 --> 01:16:25.079
   The loss of Bailey West
    and now Tracy Larson

01:16:26.140 --> 01:16:28.490
 weighs very heavily on us all.

01:16:28.643 --> 01:16:32.420
    Thankfully, the killer
     has been apprehended,

01:16:32.571 --> 01:16:35.423
    as we try to heal and
     get this behind us.

01:16:38.002 --> 01:16:40.744
    - Tracy loved to dance
       and because dance

01:16:40.763 --> 01:16:42.579
was such a big part of her life,

01:16:42.599 --> 01:16:44.840
     we thought it'd be
 appropriate if her friends,

01:16:44.992 --> 01:16:47.176
      our Renegade Girls
        show their love

01:16:47.328 --> 01:16:48.603
   the best way they know how.

01:16:50.089 --> 01:16:52.273
      (upbeat dance music)

01:16:52.424 --> 01:16:55.276
       (dancers cheering)

01:16:59.507 --> 01:17:01.523
      - [Dancers] Five,
    six, seven and eight!

01:17:01.676 --> 01:17:04.744

01:17:13.871 --> 01:17:18.799
           (panting)
     (upbeat dance music)

01:17:26.868 --> 01:17:28.050
 - This bothers you, doesn't it?

01:17:28.202 --> 01:17:29.626
            Why Nora?

01:17:29.646 --> 01:17:30.561
     Why does it bother you?

01:17:32.390 --> 01:17:33.130
          Look at them.

01:17:33.149 --> 01:17:35.775
         (upbeat music)

01:17:37.970 --> 01:17:38.711
          (eerie music)

01:17:38.729 --> 01:17:39.570
          - Hey, Nora.

01:17:41.658 --> 01:17:42.490
            - Bailey?

01:17:44.886 --> 01:17:45.993
       Bailey's not here.

01:17:46.070 --> 01:17:47.453
   You're not here (chuckles).

01:17:48.331 --> 01:17:49.664
 Make them stop (throat clears).

01:17:51.575 --> 01:17:53.575
  - No, you need to be here
  for your Renegade Girls.

01:17:53.728 --> 01:17:55.318
    - What's wrong with her?

01:17:55.338 --> 01:17:57.004
       - Mrs. McConnell,
      are you all right?

01:17:59.583 --> 01:18:00.416
   - What did they do to you?

01:18:00.568 --> 01:18:01.583
          (Nora gasps)

01:18:01.736 --> 01:18:03.344
            Tell me.

01:18:03.421 --> 01:18:04.804
   Why do you hate them, Nora?

01:18:06.741 --> 01:18:09.499
          (eerie music)

01:18:09.519 --> 01:18:11.936
      - Mrs. McConnell,
      why'd you do it?

01:18:12.689 --> 01:18:14.021
     - You're not here, Lou.

01:18:14.173 --> 01:18:14.930
        You're not here.

01:18:15.082 --> 01:18:15.773
               No.

01:18:18.194 --> 01:18:21.754
       - I'm dead too,
    Nora, because of you.

01:18:21.772 --> 01:18:23.013
            - No.
       (air whooshing)

01:18:23.032 --> 01:18:24.681
         - Nora, Nora!
- Please, please let go of me!

01:18:24.701 --> 01:18:25.533
           - Stop!
          - Please!

01:18:25.684 --> 01:18:26.701
             - No!
           - Tracy!

01:18:28.596 --> 01:18:29.778
     - You all betrayed me.

01:18:29.931 --> 01:18:31.263
      You all betrayed me.

01:18:31.282 --> 01:18:32.689
   - What did they do to you?

01:18:32.709 --> 01:18:34.542
 Tell me, why do you hate them?

01:18:35.953 --> 01:18:36.711
              - No.

01:18:38.881 --> 01:18:41.865
      Because you're all
      a bunch of whores!

01:18:41.884 --> 01:18:43.884
 All of you, you're all whores!

01:18:45.296 --> 01:18:47.221
          Look at you!

01:18:47.372 --> 01:18:48.797
              Ugh!

01:18:48.950 --> 01:18:49.724
           All of you!

01:18:51.877 --> 01:18:53.877
  She was screwing my husband!

01:18:53.896 --> 01:18:55.120
    She was screwing him!
        - Oh my God!

01:18:55.139 --> 01:18:56.789
     (reporters gasping)
       (pensive music)

01:18:56.807 --> 01:18:57.973
     - She wanted his money.

01:18:58.125 --> 01:18:59.900
     - [Reporter] What's
       wrong with her?

01:18:59.977 --> 01:19:01.051
   - She fell down the stairs.

01:19:01.070 --> 01:19:04.296
  It was an accident (gasping).

01:19:04.315 --> 01:19:06.298
        (Bailey laughing)

01:19:06.300 --> 01:19:07.074
         That's enough.

01:19:07.985 --> 01:19:08.892
     That's enough, Bailey.

01:19:08.911 --> 01:19:10.894
       (Bailey chuckling)

01:19:10.913 --> 01:19:12.805
            Stop it!

01:19:12.823 --> 01:19:14.306
     Bailey, stop recording!

01:19:14.325 --> 01:19:15.398
     Give me that cellphone.

01:19:15.418 --> 01:19:17.567
  See, she was blackmailing me.

01:19:17.587 --> 01:19:18.568
        I had no choice.

01:19:18.588 --> 01:19:19.495
        I had no choice.

01:19:19.647 --> 01:19:20.479
    I had to get rid of her.

01:19:20.498 --> 01:19:21.330
       (reporters gasping)

01:19:21.482 --> 01:19:22.815
   She's got it on video, see?

01:19:22.833 --> 01:19:23.740
          You can see.

01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:25.818
 Nope, it was Lou, Lou's fault.

01:19:25.836 --> 01:19:27.244
           Lou did it.

01:19:27.263 --> 01:19:28.821
 - [Reporter] Mrs. McConnell,
      are you all right?

01:19:28.839 --> 01:19:30.339
 - [Reporter] Mrs. McConnell,
      is that confession?

01:19:30.491 --> 01:19:32.266
       - It was not my
     idea to set you up.

01:19:32.417 --> 01:19:33.583
              Nope.

01:19:33.603 --> 01:19:35.085
      - [Reporter] You
     killed Bailey West.

01:19:35.104 --> 01:19:36.771

   saying, Mrs. McConnell?

01:19:36.847 --> 01:19:38.330

    confessing to murder?

    (reporters whispering)
        (pensive music)

01:19:39.758 --> 01:19:42.860

   - Who's she talkin' to?

01:19:44.005 --> 01:19:44.761
           - Stop it!

01:19:44.781 --> 01:19:45.946
 I'm not gonna let you ruin me!

01:19:46.098 --> 01:19:48.783
        (all screaming)
       (dramatic music)

01:19:48.934 --> 01:19:50.433
        - Stop it, Nora!

01:19:50.453 --> 01:19:52.678
      Nora, get off of her!

01:19:52.696 --> 01:19:57.625
     (shutters clicking)

01:20:09.213 --> 01:20:10.712
         - I got it all.

01:20:10.865 --> 01:20:13.307

  - You need to stay there.

01:20:16.203 --> 01:20:17.478
 - I can't believe it worked.
       - Mrs. McConnell?

01:20:17.555 --> 01:20:18.479
  - Wait, what about Tracy?
    - What about Bailey?

01:20:18.556 --> 01:20:19.772

01:24:13.382 --> 01:24:14.548
     Hands above your head.

01:24:16.110 --> 01:24:17.301
  I said hands above your head!

01:24:22.283 --> 01:24:23.557
         On your knees.

01:24:23.708 --> 01:24:28.645
       (Nora panting)
       (pensive music)

01:24:33.627 --> 01:24:34.234
            - Audrey.

01:24:36.463 --> 01:24:37.963
      You're gonna be late.

01:24:37.981 --> 01:24:39.055
     Season starts tomorrow.

01:24:39.075 --> 01:24:40.908
      You should hurry
     up and get changed.

01:24:42.803 --> 01:24:44.411
 Have you seen Bailey or Tracy?

01:24:47.641 --> 01:24:48.657
        - No, I haven't.

01:24:48.809 --> 01:24:49.491
              - No?

01:24:49.643 --> 01:24:50.709
    Well, when you see them,

01:24:53.480 --> 01:24:54.880
  will you tell them I'm sorry?

01:24:57.242 --> 01:24:58.175
      Tell them I'm sorry.

01:25:00.078 --> 01:25:01.411
   - [Freddy] You have the
   right to remain silent.

01:25:01.430 --> 01:25:02.596
 Everything you say can and will

01:25:02.747 --> 01:25:05.766
     be used against you
     in a court of law.

01:25:08.253 --> 01:25:10.178
       - [Audrey] Okay,
       full disclosure.

01:25:10.331 --> 01:25:12.755
       I clearly do not
      die in this story.

01:25:12.775 --> 01:25:14.182
          I sorta lied.

01:25:14.335 --> 01:25:15.667
     But hey, if I hadn't
        have done that,

01:25:15.686 --> 01:25:17.519
    you probably wouldn't
    have watched, right?

01:25:17.671 --> 01:25:19.688
      Don't worry, this
       isn't over yet.

01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:21.097
We need to put a ribbon on this.

01:25:21.117 --> 01:25:24.192
        (crowd cheering)

01:25:24.345 --> 01:25:25.344
     - [Blonde Reporter]
        Walter James,

01:25:25.362 --> 01:25:26.178
    you've been acquitted
       of all charges.

01:25:26.196 --> 01:25:27.121
       It's opening night.

01:25:27.272 --> 01:25:27.955
        How do you feel?

01:25:28.031 --> 01:25:28.864
         - Never better.

01:25:29.016 --> 01:25:30.106
  I mean, we got a great team.

01:25:30.126 --> 01:25:31.350
      The guys have been
   workin' hard all summer.

01:25:31.368 --> 01:25:32.184
     - I wanna introduce
    you, oh, there he is.

01:25:32.202 --> 01:25:33.109
          - Excuse me.

01:25:33.129 --> 01:25:34.035
     Excuse me guys, sorry.

01:25:34.188 --> 01:25:35.278
          Thank you.
            - Wait.

01:25:35.297 --> 01:25:36.380
 Walter, this is going out live.

01:25:38.134 --> 01:25:40.692
       (Audrey squeals)
        (gentle music)

01:25:40.711 --> 01:25:41.951
          - Hey, babe.

01:25:41.971 --> 01:25:43.804
      Walter, this is my
       mother, Jessica.

01:25:43.955 --> 01:25:45.213
     - It was a pleasure
     to meet you, Ma'am.

01:25:45.366 --> 01:25:46.140
              - Hi.

01:25:46.216 --> 01:25:48.216
   - Your daughter is amazing.

01:25:48.369 --> 01:25:49.292
          - She is.
           - I am.

01:25:49.311 --> 01:25:51.311
         (all laughing)

01:25:51.463 --> 01:25:54.148
    - I don't know how I'm
     ever gonna thank you.

01:25:55.225 --> 01:25:56.466
        - Get her a car.

01:25:56.485 --> 01:25:57.225
      I'm tired of driving.

01:25:57.378 --> 01:25:58.801
           - Mom!
       (Walter laughs)

01:25:58.821 --> 01:26:00.212
  - [Man] Hey, Walter, come on.

01:26:00.230 --> 01:26:02.281
      - I gotta go, see
     you after the game.

01:26:05.161 --> 01:26:09.312
 - So, now that you managed
 to prove a man's innocence,

01:26:10.073 --> 01:26:11.331
 have you given much thought to-

01:26:11.483 --> 01:26:12.240
          - Law school?

01:26:12.393 --> 01:26:13.333
             - Yeah.

01:26:13.410 --> 01:26:14.984
       What do you think?

01:26:15.004 --> 01:26:16.895
  - Actually, I'm thinking
  about the Police Academy.

01:26:16.914 --> 01:26:18.079
        - Police Academy.

01:26:18.232 --> 01:26:20.232
       You wanna be a cop?

01:26:20.250 --> 01:26:20.916
          - Detective.

01:26:21.068 --> 01:26:22.158
              - Hm.

01:26:22.178 --> 01:26:23.068
             - Woo!

01:26:23.070 --> 01:26:23.993
        - Are you ready?

01:26:24.013 --> 01:26:25.086
          - You bet.
            - Woo!

01:26:25.239 --> 01:26:26.571
           - Let's go.

01:26:26.590 --> 01:26:27.181
         - [Audrey] Bye.

01:26:27.332 --> 01:26:28.348
       (dancers laughing)

01:26:28.425 --> 01:26:30.592
      - Have fun, girls.
            - Woo!

01:26:30.744 --> 01:26:31.760
      (upbeat dance music)

01:26:31.912 --> 01:26:33.094
     - [Announcer] Ladies
        and gentlemen,

01:26:33.247 --> 01:26:34.262
       how about a big
      round of applause

01:26:34.415 --> 01:26:37.173
     for your Los Angeles
        Renegade Girls?

01:26:37.193 --> 01:26:42.154
     (upbeat dance music)
       (crowd cheering)

01:27:09.391 --> 01:27:12.375
     - [Audrey] My name
     is Audrey Anderson,

01:27:12.394 --> 01:27:14.377
    and I'm a Renegade Girl.

01:27:14.396 --> 01:27:16.396
        (crowd cheering)

01:27:16.548 --> 01:27:19.191
         (upbeat music)

01:28:11.011 --> 01:28:13.620
        (dramatic music)
