00:12.773 --> 00:14.206
<i>And there's one right there.</i>

00:14.275 --> 00:16.408
<i>Oliver clearly has a problem
he wants to share,</i>

00:16.477 --> 00:17.910

00:19.072 --> 00:20.450
Everything okay?

00:20.475 --> 00:22.047
Never better.

00:23.484 --> 00:24.783
Taylor has something she wants to ask me

00:24.852 --> 00:26.151
but is afraid I'll say no.

00:26.220 --> 00:28.187
If I seem agitated,
she'll wait till later.

00:28.255 --> 00:31.290
- Hey, Mom.
- Ohh! Just great!

00:33.494 --> 00:36.562
<i>And my sweet little annoyance number 3.</i>

00:36.630 --> 00:39.998
Anna-Kat, you don't need to spend
10 minutes on each Valentine card.

00:40.067 --> 00:42.201
But I want them to be nice
for kids in my class.

00:42.269 --> 00:44.136
Daddy said I should
take pride in my work.

00:44.205 --> 00:45.604
But that's not for stupid stuff,

00:45.673 --> 00:47.105
like made-up holidays.

00:47.174 --> 00:49.675
<i>Manufactured romance
is just not my thing.</i>

00:49.743 --> 00:52.277
<i>I don't have the gene for it...
unlike some people.</i>

00:52.346 --> 00:54.079
Happy Valentine's Day.

00:54.148 --> 00:56.181
- Oh. To you, too, baby.
- Mm.

00:56.250 --> 00:57.449
So, Taylor tells me...

00:57.518 --> 00:58.684
We've got to go,
or I'll be late for volleyball!

00:58.752 --> 01:00.352
I'm team captain!
Team captain can't be late!

01:00.421 --> 01:01.887
Geez, Taylor.

01:01.956 --> 01:03.021
Let's save that level of panic

01:03.090 --> 01:04.256
for the first time you miss your period.

01:04.325 --> 01:06.959
Come on, let's move it, people.

01:07.027 --> 01:09.027
I know you have to write
your book proposal,

01:09.096 --> 01:11.430
so don't feel like you need to do
anything big for me this year.

01:11.498 --> 01:12.998
Big? What ever do you mean?

Card it is.

01:41.528 --> 01:43.221
<i>He's got something planned.</i>

01:43.307 --> 01:45.097
<i>Why couldn't he embrace
a more meaningful holiday?</i>

01:45.165 --> 01:46.900
<i>Groundhog Day is totally underrated.</i>

01:54.375 --> 01:57.910
So, tonight, there's a Valentine's
party at Casey Otis' house.

01:57.978 --> 01:59.144
Will her parents be there?

01:59.213 --> 02:00.946
Yes, both her moms and her stepmom.

02:01.015 --> 02:02.247
Lot of math on that.

02:02.316 --> 02:03.515
Can I go?

02:03.584 --> 02:05.150
Before I say yes,
I need to call and confirm

02:05.219 --> 02:06.318
that somebody will be there.

02:06.387 --> 02:07.920
Dad said the exact same thing,

02:07.988 --> 02:09.187
and he already called them
and talked to them.

02:09.256 --> 02:10.889
Well, if Dad cleared it,
then it's okay with me.

02:10.958 --> 02:13.392
Thank you, Mom! You're the best!

02:13.460 --> 02:14.559
Can I borrow your high heels?

02:14.628 --> 02:16.891
- No.
- You never let me do anything!

02:18.832 --> 02:20.365
What's in that box?

02:20.434 --> 02:22.234
Nothing.

02:23.904 --> 02:25.370
Valentine's Day.

02:25.439 --> 02:26.939
Spill it.

02:27.007 --> 02:28.440
You know what? Never mind.

02:28.509 --> 02:29.841
You don't really need this.

02:31.278 --> 02:32.711
Got it!

02:32.780 --> 02:34.046
Open this.

02:36.684 --> 02:37.783
Pretty!

02:37.851 --> 02:39.518
What does the "A" stand for?

02:40.688 --> 02:41.987
Did you buy this for Alice?

02:42.056 --> 02:45.657
O-li-ver!

02:45.826 --> 02:48.593
Yeah, but I'm having second
thoughts about giving it to her.

02:48.662 --> 02:51.196
I mean, we haven't talked about
boyfriend/girlfriend or anything.

02:51.265 --> 02:52.798
What's the worst that could happen?

02:52.866 --> 02:54.332
She'll think it's stupid
and tell her friends,

02:54.401 --> 02:56.001
and everyone will mock me
behind my back.

02:56.070 --> 02:57.536
Yeah, that could totally happen.

02:57.604 --> 03:00.138
Why don't you hold on to it,
feel out the situation,

03:00.207 --> 03:02.607
and then decide what to do
when you see her?

03:02.676 --> 03:04.276
That's a good idea.

03:04.344 --> 03:06.411
He said I had a good idea!

03:06.477 --> 03:08.663
Mark the date and the time!
Ring the bells!

03:09.683 --> 03:11.583
I'm not prepared for the level of stress

03:11.652 --> 03:12.918
that comes with this holiday.

03:12.986 --> 03:13.985
Yeah.

03:15.722 --> 03:17.222
Think about it.

03:17.291 --> 03:19.024
Kids giving out those candy hearts...

03:19.093 --> 03:20.292
"Be mine," "Kiss me"...

03:20.360 --> 03:22.260
it's encouraging
a generation of hookers.

03:22.329 --> 03:23.528
Katie, hookers don't kiss...

03:23.597 --> 03:25.430
unless you give them an extra $50.

03:25.499 --> 03:26.665
And I know that Greg is planning

03:26.733 --> 03:28.500
one of his elaborate romantic surprises.

03:28.569 --> 03:30.202
Quit showing off, Greg.

03:30.270 --> 03:31.269
You got the gig.

03:31.338 --> 03:32.471
Here's the thing.

03:32.539 --> 03:33.905
I get him a card, like a normal person,

03:33.974 --> 03:35.307
which, by comparison,

03:35.375 --> 03:37.509
makes me look like a terrible wife.

03:37.578 --> 03:40.312
Plus, his surprises
always tend to make a mess.

03:46.787 --> 03:48.220
Mm.

03:48.288 --> 03:51.523
It seems you and Greg
have different love languages.

03:51.592 --> 03:53.191
Say what, now?

03:53.260 --> 03:55.289
She bathes her crystals
in the light of a full moon.

03:55.367 --> 03:57.629
I think you're in great hands.

03:57.698 --> 03:59.831
Okay, there are five languages of love.

03:59.900 --> 04:02.200
For some people, love is quality time.

04:02.269 --> 04:04.469
Others need to experience
physical touch.

04:04.538 --> 04:06.538
Greg's language is affirmation.

04:06.607 --> 04:07.906
Uh-huh.

04:07.975 --> 04:10.075
And your language is irritation.

04:10.144 --> 04:10.976
Mm.

04:11.044 --> 04:12.344
You're not shy.

04:12.412 --> 04:14.386
Why don't you just tell Greg
you don't like his surprises?

04:14.480 --> 04:16.113
- Mm.
- I don't want to hurt his feelings.

04:16.183 --> 04:17.849
He puts so much work into it.

04:17.918 --> 04:20.652
But what I wish is for someone
to tell him what I really want

04:20.721 --> 04:23.655
for my Valentine's surprise
this year is no surprise.

04:23.724 --> 04:25.257
Richard and I do it right.

04:25.325 --> 04:26.625
He gives me an expensive watch,

04:26.693 --> 04:28.226
and then I'm a real bobcat in the sack.

04:29.630 --> 04:30.962
Don't take love for granted.

04:31.031 --> 04:33.632
If you don't maintain it,
it'll dry up on you.

04:33.700 --> 04:35.267
And then divorce you, take your Jaguar,

04:35.335 --> 04:37.102
and suddenly, your kids are vegetarian.

04:37.171 --> 04:39.104
Aw.

04:39.173 --> 04:40.805
It's Valentine's Day,
and you're all alone.

04:40.874 --> 04:43.208
Oh, no, no. No, don't worry about me.

04:43.277 --> 04:44.609
The bars tonight are gonna be full

04:44.678 --> 04:46.845
of sad, neglected Westport housewives

04:46.914 --> 04:48.947
looking for a little... understanding.

04:50.117 --> 04:52.184
I love that you can make
any word filthy.

04:53.353 --> 04:55.453
You prey on these women's
vulnerabilities.

04:55.522 --> 04:57.322
You're a love vulture.

05:02.930 --> 05:04.229
Hello?

05:05.465 --> 05:07.197
I should take this.

05:08.001 --> 05:09.267
Oh. I got to go.

05:09.336 --> 05:11.036
I need to listen
to that Adele breakup album

05:11.104 --> 05:13.405
and remind myself that I should
be happy that I'm not alone.

05:19.079 --> 05:20.812
- Hey, Alice.
- Hi.

05:20.881 --> 05:22.614
Happy Valentine's Day.

05:22.683 --> 05:25.383
Y-Yeah, I got to go. I'm late for class.

05:27.054 --> 05:28.620
School's over!

05:28.689 --> 05:29.721
But okay!

05:32.859 --> 05:35.327
♪ I'm down on my daydream ♪

05:35.395 --> 05:37.744
♪ That sleepwalk should be over

Hall and Oates.

05:40.234 --> 05:42.885
<i>That's so Greg. He must have
a surprise waiting.</i>

05:44.905 --> 05:46.404
Greg?

05:47.975 --> 05:48.940
Greg?

05:49.009 --> 05:50.408
<i>A leaf blower?</i>

05:50.477 --> 05:52.210
<i>We are not having that "Give it all up</i>

05:52.279 --> 05:54.779
<i>and become gardeners
in Vermont" conversation again.</i>

05:55.983 --> 05:57.349
<i>The bedroom.</i>

05:57.417 --> 06:00.141
<i>Might as well go up
and get it over with.</i>

06:03.524 --> 06:04.556
Hey.

06:04.625 --> 06:06.532
Looking for something?

06:07.294 --> 06:08.727
Just checking in.

06:08.795 --> 06:11.062
<b>What do you know? He actually listened.</b>

06:11.131 --> 06:13.164
<i>Maybe now I can get him to stop
playing historical charades</i>

06:13.233 --> 06:14.332
<i>on Presidents' Day.</i>

06:15.502 --> 06:17.226
I'm a little teapot?

06:18.238 --> 06:19.704
Taylor's a little teapot?

06:23.844 --> 06:25.810
Teapot Dome Scandal!

06:25.879 --> 06:27.479
I'm a teapot. You two watch "Scandal."

06:27.547 --> 06:28.747
How could you not get that?

06:28.815 --> 06:30.949
Yeah. Yeah, that's on us.

06:31.018 --> 06:33.585
You want to read the intro
to my book proposal?

06:33.654 --> 06:35.053
So bad.

06:35.122 --> 06:37.255
So, so bad.

06:37.324 --> 06:38.590
Can't now.

06:38.659 --> 06:39.691
But real soon.

06:44.765 --> 06:46.798
Why are you throwing out
all the Valentines

06:46.867 --> 06:47.999
you got from your class?

06:48.068 --> 06:49.901
They're just cruddy drugstore cards

06:49.970 --> 06:52.137
their parents signed for them.

06:52.205 --> 06:54.339
I'm a little down on love.

06:54.408 --> 06:55.874
Join the club.

06:55.942 --> 06:57.542
The hell with Alice.

06:57.611 --> 07:00.111
I think it's sweet
that you have a romantic side.

07:00.180 --> 07:01.913
You have a little bit
of your dad in you.

07:01.982 --> 07:05.383
By the way, why hasn't he done
anything for you this year?

07:05.452 --> 07:07.819
Where's the skywriting,
the marching bands?

07:07.888 --> 07:09.554
You guys having problems?

07:09.623 --> 07:10.689
What?!

07:10.757 --> 07:12.157
No!

07:12.225 --> 07:14.359
We're not having problems.

07:14.428 --> 07:15.760
<i>Are we?</i>

07:15.829 --> 07:18.129
Good, because if you two ever
went your separate ways...

07:18.198 --> 07:19.531
Oh, sweetie.

07:19.599 --> 07:22.667
I can't even imagine living
in something smaller than this.

07:22.736 --> 07:24.436
Katie, can you come here for a sec?

07:24.504 --> 07:25.804
<i>That's probably it...</i>

07:25.872 --> 07:27.672
<i>Valentine's surprise in his office.</i>

07:27.741 --> 07:29.007
<i>No problems here.</i>

07:32.245 --> 07:34.479
So, what can I do for you?

07:34.548 --> 07:36.319
Have you seen my lumbar support cushion?

07:37.551 --> 07:39.317
It's now Anna-Kat's pony bed.

07:40.721 --> 07:43.488
Anything... you have...

07:43.557 --> 07:46.491
going on... around here?

07:46.560 --> 07:48.860
No, just proofing my book proposal.

07:49.963 --> 07:50.829
Great.

07:50.897 --> 07:52.397
<i>Oh, God.</i>

07:52.466 --> 07:54.032
<i>Have I neglected Greg for so long</i>

07:54.101 --> 07:55.367
<i>that our romance has dried up?</i>

07:55.435 --> 07:57.068
<i>Like that sponge below the kitchen sink</i>

07:57.137 --> 07:58.737
<i>that I never use but I never throw away?</i>

07:58.805 --> 08:00.305
My ride to the party's here.

08:00.374 --> 08:01.539
Call us when you get there.

08:01.608 --> 08:03.842
And don't let anybody
cop a Valentine's feel.

08:03.910 --> 08:05.665
Uncomfortable. I'm leaving.

08:05.782 --> 08:06.978
And text us every hour.

08:07.047 --> 08:08.446
Don't you trust me?

08:08.515 --> 08:10.954
Yeah, but that whole cop-a-feel
thing really freaked me out.

08:12.118 --> 08:15.404
Okay. Well... I'll leave you alone.

08:18.825 --> 08:20.992
Oh! Who's this for?

08:21.061 --> 08:22.724
Oh. It's all yours.

08:22.802 --> 08:24.596
<i>It must be a part of a bigger surprise,</i>

08:24.664 --> 08:27.707
<i>like the first clue of a
scavenger hunt is hidden inside.</i>

08:35.475 --> 08:37.075
That was an odd thing to do.

08:39.379 --> 08:42.313
Just wanted to offer you half.

08:42.381 --> 08:43.815
You sure you don't want
to step on it first,

08:43.884 --> 08:45.350
maybe run it over with your car?

Hey, Mom...

Just great!

09:12.692 --> 09:14.559
Hi.

09:14.628 --> 09:16.995
Casey Otis is having a party
tonight, and...

09:17.064 --> 09:19.030
Is she the one whose father
got gender-reassignment surgery,

09:19.099 --> 09:20.765
then her mom left him
and married another woman?

09:20.834 --> 09:22.167
Right. Can I go?

09:22.235 --> 09:24.035
Will there be a mom, stepmom,
or trans-mom present?

09:24.104 --> 09:26.905
Totally... Mom asked the same thing,
and she already called to make sure.

09:26.973 --> 09:28.206
Well, if it's okay with her,
it's okay with me.

09:28.275 --> 09:29.107
Thank you!

09:29.176 --> 09:30.842
I'll just double-check.

09:34.047 --> 09:35.447
Happy Valentine's Day.

09:35.515 --> 09:37.515
- Oh. To you, too, baby.
- Mm.

09:37.584 --> 09:38.817
So, Taylor tells me...

09:38.885 --> 09:40.485
We have to go, or I'll be late
for volleyball practice!

09:40.554 --> 09:42.387
I'm team captain!
Team captain can't be late!

09:42.456 --> 09:43.888
Geez, Taylor.

09:43.957 --> 09:45.023
Let's save that level of panic

09:45.092 --> 09:46.825
for the first time you miss your period.

09:46.893 --> 09:49.194
Come on, let's move it, people.

09:49.262 --> 09:50.962
I know you have to write
your book proposal,

09:51.031 --> 09:52.363
so don't feel like you need to do

09:52.432 --> 09:53.798
anything big for me this year.

09:53.867 --> 09:55.667
Big? Whatever do you mean?

09:55.735 --> 09:59.337
Seriously, a card is all I need.

09:59.406 --> 10:00.939
Card it is.

10:04.644 --> 10:06.344
It'll be the biggest one yet.

10:14.688 --> 10:15.854
You're a love vulture.

10:20.927 --> 10:21.893
Hello?

10:21.962 --> 10:23.428
Doris, it's Greg.

10:23.497 --> 10:24.762
I need to talk to you
without Katie knowing.

10:24.831 --> 10:26.564
I should take this.

10:26.633 --> 10:27.866
What do you need?

10:27.934 --> 10:30.235
Okay, I have a big Valentine's
Day surprise for Katie,

10:30.303 --> 10:32.470
but I'm not done setting up,
and I need you to stall her.

10:32.539 --> 10:35.240
Oh, Greg, maybe
you shouldn't surprise her.

10:35.308 --> 10:36.374
Oh, no, I do it every year.

10:36.443 --> 10:37.742
Oh, I know, but the thing is,

10:37.811 --> 10:39.410
all those over-the-top
productions you do...

10:39.479 --> 10:40.712
she hates them.

10:40.780 --> 10:41.913
- Really?
- Yeah.

10:41.982 --> 10:43.414
She doesn't tell you
because she doesn't want

10:43.483 --> 10:44.649
to hurt your feelings.

10:44.718 --> 10:46.317
I clearly have no issue with it.

10:46.386 --> 10:48.052
Oh.

10:48.121 --> 10:51.222
Okay, well...
thanks for letting me know.

10:51.291 --> 10:54.292
She just left, so whatever
dumb thing you're planning,

10:54.361 --> 10:56.227
put an end to it now.

11:05.539 --> 11:07.739
I totally love sailing now. I mean...

11:09.609 --> 11:12.010
Well, we're taking the boat out
this weekend.

11:12.078 --> 11:13.678
My parents said you could come.

11:13.747 --> 11:14.679
Cool.

11:14.748 --> 11:16.714
You're so funny.

11:16.783 --> 11:18.316
Later.

11:20.987 --> 11:22.420
Oh, hi, Anna-Kat.

11:22.489 --> 11:23.888
You go near my brother again,

11:23.957 --> 11:25.990
I'll put poison in your water bottle.

11:27.093 --> 11:28.927
Maybe I already did.

11:33.733 --> 11:35.033
Hey, Alice.

11:35.101 --> 11:35.967
Hi.

11:36.036 --> 11:37.502
Happy Valentine's Day.

11:37.571 --> 11:39.604
Yeah, uh, I got to go to class.

11:39.673 --> 11:40.905
I'm late.

11:42.842 --> 11:44.509
School's over!

11:44.578 --> 11:45.677
But okay!

11:53.119 --> 11:55.220
This is gonna take forever.

12:06.366 --> 12:08.199
This is Greg Otto!

12:08.268 --> 12:10.735
I'm canceling!

12:10.804 --> 12:12.203
Don't come!

12:13.873 --> 12:14.939
What do you mean they're already here?

12:20.046 --> 12:22.614

Greg?

13:30.050 --> 13:31.382
Hey.

13:31.451 --> 13:32.917
Looking for something?

13:32.986 --> 13:36.020
Just checking in.

13:38.458 --> 13:39.924
Just proofing my book proposal.

13:39.993 --> 13:41.125
My ride to the party's here.

13:41.194 --> 13:42.427
Call us when you get there.

13:42.495 --> 13:44.395
And don't let anybody
cop a Valentine's feel.

13:44.464 --> 13:46.064
Uncomfortable. I'm leaving.

13:46.132 --> 13:47.198
Text us every hour.

13:47.267 --> 13:48.733
Don't you trust me?

13:48.802 --> 13:51.035
Yeah, but that whole cop-a-feel
thing really freaked me out.

13:59.112 --> 14:02.080
Just wanted to offer you half.

14:02.148 --> 14:03.715
You sure you don't want
to step on it first,

14:03.783 --> 14:05.249
maybe run it over with your car?

14:05.318 --> 14:07.752
Why didn't you do anything
for me for Valentine's Day?

14:07.821 --> 14:08.953
You told me not to.

14:09.022 --> 14:10.888
I also told you that the big forks

14:10.957 --> 14:12.724
don't go with the little forks
in the silverware tray,

14:12.792 --> 14:14.092
but that never stopped you.

14:14.160 --> 14:16.494
Doris told me you hate my surprises.

14:17.697 --> 14:20.665
I'm sorry I've been so romantic
all these years.

14:20.734 --> 14:22.800
Must have been terrible for you.

14:22.869 --> 14:24.469
It's not terrible!

14:24.537 --> 14:26.170
It's just annoying!

14:26.239 --> 14:27.638
I mean, I love you!

14:34.658 --> 14:36.158
It's just annoying!

14:36.520 --> 14:38.053
I mean, I love you!

14:38.122 --> 14:40.055
You should have told me
that you hate my surprises.

14:40.124 --> 14:42.191
I feel like an idiot having made
such a fuss all these years.

14:42.259 --> 14:44.426
I would never let you know
you ruined my Valentine's Day,

14:44.495 --> 14:46.195
because I don't like Valentine's Day,

14:46.263 --> 14:47.429
so there's nothing there to ruin.

14:48.933 --> 14:51.099
Mom just made everything so clear to me.

14:51.168 --> 14:53.068
She did? I didn't understand her.

14:53.137 --> 14:54.503
Exactly.

14:54.572 --> 14:57.172
That's what makes sense...
her not making sense.

14:58.108 --> 14:59.441
Okay...?

14:59.510 --> 15:01.944
Maybe all girls get confused
on Valentine's Day.

15:02.012 --> 15:03.679
That's why Alice was acting all weird.

15:03.747 --> 15:05.013
I don't think that's it.

15:06.884 --> 15:08.217
I'm just gonna give her the key chain.

15:08.285 --> 15:09.851
No!

15:09.920 --> 15:12.187
- Why do you care?
- I don't.

15:12.256 --> 15:13.689
What's Alice doing here?

15:13.757 --> 15:14.690
Where?!

15:14.758 --> 15:15.791
Ha!

15:15.859 --> 15:17.859
Hey! Give that back! That's for Alice!

15:17.928 --> 15:19.194
It's for the toilet now!

15:21.232 --> 15:23.031
Look, I don't give you a hard
time for not making an effort.

15:23.100 --> 15:24.499
You shouldn't give me
a hard time for making one.

15:24.568 --> 15:26.702
- You should appreciate it.
- I do!

15:26.770 --> 15:28.337
Kind of.

15:28.405 --> 15:30.305
We just speak different love languages.

15:30.374 --> 15:32.441
- Where'd you get that nonsense?
- Angela.

15:32.509 --> 15:34.109
She also sleeps under a copper pyramid

15:34.178 --> 15:35.344
so she can live forever.

15:35.412 --> 15:36.979
Oliver: Give it back now!

15:37.047 --> 15:38.981
You're not supposed to lock doors! Mom!

15:39.049 --> 15:40.649
What is going on?!

15:40.718 --> 15:43.252
We are trying to celebrate
Valentine's Day over here!

15:43.320 --> 15:44.953
Anna-Kat stole my present for Alice.

15:46.223 --> 15:48.290
Anna-Kat, open this door! Right now!

15:48.359 --> 15:49.324
Right now!

15:51.195 --> 15:53.996
Sweetie, why did you take
Oliver's key chain?

15:54.064 --> 15:55.697
I don't want him to give it to Alice.

15:55.766 --> 15:56.932
That's none of your business.

15:57.001 --> 15:58.133
Quiet.

15:58.202 --> 16:00.335
Why don't you want him
to give it to her?

16:00.404 --> 16:03.639
I caught Alice flirting
with Kurt Brockwell in the hall.

16:03.707 --> 16:05.374
Kurt Brockwell...

16:05.442 --> 16:07.476
That super-hot guy that danced
with Alice at the cotillion?

16:07.544 --> 16:09.378
The 14-year-old boy, yes.

16:09.446 --> 16:10.512
That's what I said.

16:10.581 --> 16:12.014
Are you sure it was flirting?

16:12.082 --> 16:14.049
He said, "Cool."

16:14.118 --> 16:18.787
She went, "Ha ha ha! You're so funny."

16:18.856 --> 16:20.889
An unmotivated expression of delight.

16:20.958 --> 16:22.658
I'm sorry, son.

16:24.295 --> 16:28.797
You are a wonderful, smart...

16:28.866 --> 16:30.465
sometimes-sweet kid.

16:30.534 --> 16:32.034
So forget about Alice McCarthy.

16:32.102 --> 16:34.269
- If she wants that super-hot guy...
- Katie!

16:35.406 --> 16:36.972
...then it's her loss.

16:37.041 --> 16:37.906
Look at me.

16:39.276 --> 16:43.278
Any girl would be lucky
to get a gift from you.

16:46.483 --> 16:48.150
If it makes you feel better,

16:48.218 --> 16:50.786
I threatened to poison her
if she ever came near you again.

16:50.854 --> 16:53.121
That does make me feel better.

16:53.190 --> 16:55.090
- Doesn't make me feel better.
- Mnh-mnh.

16:56.427 --> 16:57.693
Poor Oliver.

16:57.761 --> 16:59.227
It can be extremely disappointing

16:59.296 --> 17:00.896
when you plan a surprise for somebody

17:00.964 --> 17:02.097
and they don't appreciate it.

17:02.166 --> 17:04.965
And the subtlety award goes to not Greg.

17:05.035 --> 17:06.233
Don't be mad.

17:06.303 --> 17:08.737
I just don't need a flash mob
or barbershop quartet

17:08.806 --> 17:10.038
or a full choir singing to me.

17:10.107 --> 17:11.940
- You knew about the choir?
- You got a choir?!

17:13.978 --> 17:15.377
Hey, Taylor.

17:15.445 --> 17:17.279
What's wrong?

17:17.348 --> 17:18.780
She fell and sprained her ankle.

17:18.848 --> 17:20.482
Let me talk to one of Amy's moms.

17:21.585 --> 17:22.651
None of them are there?

17:22.720 --> 17:23.730
What do you mean, no one's there?

17:23.755 --> 17:25.954
Don't move. We are coming
to get you right now.

17:26.022 --> 17:27.356
Taylor told me you talked to a parent.

17:27.424 --> 17:28.457
She told me the same thing.

17:28.525 --> 17:29.691
She played us, Greg.

17:31.395 --> 17:33.228
It's extremely disappointing
when a family member

17:33.297 --> 17:35.130
withholds important information
from you.

17:35.199 --> 17:36.898
T.O. Kid's hurt. Fight's on hold.

17:36.967 --> 17:38.634
Right. What's "T.O."?

17:38.702 --> 17:40.510
- Time-out.
- Right.

17:40.619 --> 17:42.804
Thank you for watching the kids
on such short notice.

17:42.873 --> 17:44.306
Of course.

17:44.375 --> 17:45.340
Hi.

17:45.409 --> 17:46.575
This is Samantha.

17:46.644 --> 17:48.877
We bumped into each other
at the bar... at Viva's.

17:48.946 --> 17:50.178
You're a mom at school.

17:50.247 --> 17:52.114
Yeah, our sons are in
the Entrepreneurs Club together.

17:52.182 --> 17:53.582
That's right!

17:53.651 --> 17:54.750
Vulture.

17:56.020 --> 17:57.252
Can we go?

17:57.321 --> 17:58.353
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

18:01.558 --> 18:02.924
The doctor at the emergency room

18:02.993 --> 18:04.359
said you need to keep
your foot elevated.

18:04.428 --> 18:05.961
This is why I didn't want you
to wear my heels.

18:06.030 --> 18:07.629
I know what I'm talking about!

18:07.698 --> 18:09.865
And you lied to us about there
being an adult at the party!

18:09.933 --> 18:11.300
You don't have to keep yelling at me.

18:11.368 --> 18:12.734
I feel bad enough already.

18:12.803 --> 18:14.269
I'm out for the whole volleyball season.

18:14.338 --> 18:17.406
Yeah. It's your own fault...
because you didn't listen!

18:17.474 --> 18:19.775
- You're still yelling at me.
- Damn right I am!

18:19.843 --> 18:21.877
I wanted to go to the party,
and I knew you'd say no.

18:21.945 --> 18:24.079
And we'd be right, because there
was no one there watching you,

18:24.148 --> 18:25.414
and it turned out to be a disaster!

18:25.482 --> 18:27.382
Did you think that we wanted
to spend our Valentine's Day

18:27.451 --> 18:28.450
in the emergency room?

18:28.519 --> 18:29.751
No.

18:29.820 --> 18:32.654
You weren't thinking
about anybody but yourself.

18:32.723 --> 18:34.056
Only what you wanted.

18:39.196 --> 18:40.262
Time in.

18:41.598 --> 18:42.597
Yeah, that's right.

18:44.068 --> 18:45.467
Katie, I'm wrong to be mad at you

18:45.536 --> 18:47.102
about not liking my surprises.

18:47.171 --> 18:48.937
I guess I was only thinking
about what I want.

18:49.006 --> 18:50.405
I just have to accept

18:50.474 --> 18:53.108
that when it comes to
matters of the heart...

18:53.177 --> 18:54.509
you're kind of a dude.

18:58.982 --> 19:00.048
Can I...

19:00.117 --> 19:01.249
No! You're grounded!

19:01.318 --> 19:03.151
Well, I-I didn't let anyone cop a feel.

19:03.220 --> 19:05.287
You don't get points for that!

19:10.427 --> 19:12.527
Hey.

19:12.596 --> 19:14.196
This is for you.

19:14.264 --> 19:16.298
Really?

19:16.367 --> 19:19.501
It has an "A" on it... for "Anna-Kat."

19:19.570 --> 19:21.570
Thanks for sticking up for me.

19:21.638 --> 19:23.271
I love it.

19:23.340 --> 19:24.673
I'm glad.

19:24.742 --> 19:26.942
Happy Valentine's Day.

19:29.313 --> 19:31.313
So, what are we playing?

19:31.382 --> 19:33.548
It's fine. You don't
have to play with me.

19:33.617 --> 19:34.850
Yes, I do.

19:34.918 --> 19:37.085
'Cause I'm your sister? And you love me?

19:37.154 --> 19:38.420
Sure.

19:38.489 --> 19:41.990
And Angela's downstairs with
my friend's mom, sucking face.

19:42.059 --> 19:43.431
Got it.

19:45.221 --> 19:47.580
<i>I finally get the love-language thing.</i>

19:47.705 --> 19:50.299
<i>Greg loves me the way
he wants to be loved.</i>

19:50.507 --> 19:52.507
<i>If he likes these elaborate gestures,</i>

19:52.576 --> 19:54.242
<i>then I need to get on board...</i>

19:54.311 --> 19:55.477
<i>for him.</i>

19:55.546 --> 19:58.113
Finally got Anna-Kat down.

20:00.360 --> 20:01.626
What's going on in here?

20:01.906 --> 20:03.518
Shh.

20:03.587 --> 20:07.260
"John Stewart Mill's
conception of liberty

20:07.357 --> 20:10.258
justified the freedom of the individual

20:10.327 --> 20:12.994
in opposition to unlimited state

20:13.063 --> 20:17.165
and social... control."

20:17.234 --> 20:22.670
You're reading my book proposal
lying in bed, wearing lingerie?

20:22.739 --> 20:24.439
I've never been more turned on.

20:24.507 --> 20:26.941
You are definitely speaking
my love language!

20:29.177 --> 20:31.247
Happy Valentine's Day, baby.

20:40.455 --> 20:41.773
You're cleaning that up.

20:41.867 --> 20:43.140
Eh.
