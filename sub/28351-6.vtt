00:01.233 --> 00:01.433
.

00:10.833 --> 00:11.933
Geordies are back.

00:12.000 --> 00:13.533
Hello!

00:13.600 --> 00:15.167
'Doing the things we love.'

00:15.233 --> 00:20.433
'But this time,
man's gonna mix things right
up.'

00:24.667 --> 00:27.067
(knock on door)
There are four newbies!

00:27.133 --> 00:30.433
Oh, my God!
It's gonna be fucking mint.

00:32.033 --> 00:35.167
Anna's given the Geordie squad
a naughty facelift.

00:35.233 --> 00:36.967
I love a bit of change, me.

00:38.200 --> 00:40.300
But some things never change.

00:43.700 --> 00:45.633
I love this family.

00:46.500 --> 00:49.033
(bell rings)
Ding-fuckin-ding, you dicks.

00:49.100 --> 00:50.233
(all cheer)

00:50.300 --> 00:52.467
Take it all in, bitch.
Take it all in.

00:53.767 --> 00:55.233
He is a bit of me.

00:56.133 --> 00:57.267
What have I done?

01:00.167 --> 01:03.900
Is he boyfriend material,
Bethan?
Shit! I'm falling, aren't I?

01:03.967 --> 01:06.700
It's not nice telling my
boyfriend
I'm insecure.

01:06.767 --> 01:09.900
Now I've a good boy, my
insecurities
won't let us enjoy it.

01:09.967 --> 01:12.633
Think you can give us
more affection, attention.

01:12.700 --> 01:14.400
Going to do whatever it takes.

01:14.467 --> 01:16.333
Howdy, howdy, let's get rowdy.

01:16.400 --> 01:19.167
What the fuck?
Alex is like a boomerang.

01:19.233 --> 01:23.267
Imagine my boyfriend sitting at
home
now, knowing he's in here.

01:23.333 --> 01:26.033
I love the friends
that I've made in this house,

01:26.100 --> 01:28.267
cos they're like my family,

01:28.333 --> 01:30.933
but I actually have to
put myself first.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.067
Wait.

01:32.133 --> 01:34.700
This house is never gonna be
the same again.

01:37.967 --> 01:39.833
'I'm preened to perfection.'

01:39.900 --> 01:41.967
'I'm totally crackers, me,
like.'

01:42.033 --> 01:45.000
'A lad who's got more cheek
than a girl with fillers.'

01:45.067 --> 01:48.500
'Sometimes bubbly, sometimes
bitchy,
I'm all over the place.'

01:48.567 --> 01:51.267
'I'm that good-looking
I'd neck on with myself.'

01:51.333 --> 01:54.067
'I can talk the back legs
off a donkey.'

01:54.133 --> 01:56.967
'I might dance like a grandad,
but I'm proper radge.'

01:57.033 --> 01:59.600
'I'm fake, I'm flirty
and I've got double Fs.'

01:59.667 --> 02:02.900
'I don't go on the pull.
The girls just love the guns.'

02:02.967 --> 02:06.333
'I might look rough and ready,
but I am a massive softie.'

02:06.400 --> 02:09.532
'I can't believe anyone would
put me
in charge of this lot.'

02:09.600 --> 02:11.500
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye.

02:19.033 --> 02:22.200
Waking up this morning in my own
bed
with my boyfriend Jay

02:22.267 --> 02:23.600
felt really weird.

02:23.667 --> 02:24.733
Leaving that house

02:24.800 --> 02:29.600
was probably the most
heart-breaking
thing I have ever had to do.

02:29.667 --> 02:30.900
Hello, darling.

02:32.767 --> 02:35.667
But I know it was
the right thing to do.

02:35.733 --> 02:38.300
Got your breakfast.
Looks nice.

02:48.400 --> 02:52.367
I think today is gonna be weird.
It is gonna be weird.

02:52.433 --> 02:56.433
I still can't believe Sophie's
left.
Can't imagine this house without
her.

02:56.500 --> 02:59.400
I literally feel like I've been
broken up with again.

02:59.467 --> 03:02.200
Sophie leaving last night was
a shock for the house

03:02.267 --> 03:03.700
and I don't believe it.

03:03.767 --> 03:05.867
I'm gonna make sure
I go see her later on

03:05.933 --> 03:08.000
and find out
exactly what's going on.

03:08.067 --> 03:10.233
I feel like if we were to go
downstairs now

03:10.300 --> 03:12.733
we'd be sat
waiting for Sophie to come down.

03:12.800 --> 03:15.400
And she's not gonna be there.
No.

03:15.467 --> 03:16.467
I came back

03:16.533 --> 03:20.300
because I missed my Geordie
family,
I didn't expect Sophie to leave,

03:20.367 --> 03:22.567
but, to be honest,
I am so happy for Sophie

03:22.633 --> 03:26.633
she's met a new guy, she's
happy,
because she does deserve the
best.

03:26.700 --> 03:29.333
For her, it's the best decision
she could've made

03:29.400 --> 03:31.300
and she's happier doing that.

03:35.267 --> 03:38.433
Sophie leaving yesterday
was a big deal,

03:38.500 --> 03:42.300
but it also meant that me and
Beau
could sneak off and shag

03:42.367 --> 03:45.367
in the Shag Pad for the first
time.
It was so good.

03:47.200 --> 03:48.867
Hi, Chloe. Come, come.

03:51.000 --> 03:55.600
What a fucking morning this is.
I tell you what, never again.

03:57.433 --> 03:59.300
Morning, Shagger.

03:59.367 --> 04:03.200
I can't wait to tell the girls
what went on with Beau last
night.

04:03.267 --> 04:04.533
Did you shag?

04:04.600 --> 04:07.667
Yeah! Whoo!

04:07.733 --> 04:11.800
I am over the moon for Bethan,
but
the second time she's shagged
Beau,

04:11.867 --> 04:14.067
the second time,
you get the feelings.

04:14.133 --> 04:16.632
How long did he last?
Well, this is the thing.

04:16.700 --> 04:19.533
I said 30 seconds, but he was
like,

04:19.600 --> 04:22.733
"No! I didn't last 30 seconds!"
Is that a fucking joke?

04:22.800 --> 04:27.200
Beau only lasted 30 seconds.
It was a wicked 30 seconds,
though.

04:27.267 --> 04:30.567
He was like, "Fuck it,"
and I was like, "Ah!"

04:37.500 --> 04:39.633
How was the sex?
It only took 30 seconds.

04:39.700 --> 04:40.833
Ha-hey!

04:40.900 --> 04:44.033
Thirty seconds of hanky-panky.
What's the point?

04:44.100 --> 04:47.567
What you could do in 30 seconds.
I could put toast in a toaster,

04:47.633 --> 04:49.867
get the knife
and get the butter.

04:49.933 --> 04:52.100
I could get downstairs
in 30 seconds.

04:52.167 --> 04:54.667
Mix it up.
What couldn't you do in 30
seconds?

04:54.733 --> 04:56.667
Make a bowl of ravioli
in 30 seconds.

04:56.733 --> 04:59.267
Make a lasagne in 30 seconds.

04:59.333 --> 05:01.900
I don't think I could fuck
and cum in 30 seconds.

05:01.967 --> 05:06.100
The boys are giving me shit,
but I don't care, I had a mint
night.

05:06.167 --> 05:08.833
All I'm saying is you
don't get paid for overtime.

05:08.900 --> 05:10.533
Exactly. mate.

05:15.033 --> 05:18.467
Mine and Sam's relationship
is moving in the right
direction.

05:18.533 --> 05:20.300
He is showing me more attention

05:20.367 --> 05:23.567
and our relationship
is slowly getting back on track.

05:23.633 --> 05:27.233
I fucking hate waking up and
feeling shit underneath your
feet,

05:27.300 --> 05:30.367
and you don't know what it is,
but it's just sticky.

05:32.967 --> 05:35.400
Oh.
What the fuck, man?

05:35.467 --> 05:38.533
This lot have got work,
and normally with someone
leaving

05:38.600 --> 05:40.733
them lot would have to pick
up the slack,

05:40.800 --> 05:44.433
but it's Sophie, and she does
fuck
all, so I am sure they'll be
sweet.

05:44.500 --> 05:47.933
What the fuck happened last
night?
Fucking what didn't happen?

05:48.000 --> 05:50.800
Sophie's gone, now Scott's come
in
to send us to work.

05:50.867 --> 05:52.333
Can't we just have a day off?

05:54.367 --> 05:56.500
I have got a wicked singles
event

05:56.567 --> 06:00.033
which Anna's asked me
to get youse to go to

06:00.100 --> 06:04.867
and I'm gonna send Nathan,
Tahlia,
Beau, Bethan. And Alex can go.

06:04.933 --> 06:07.367
Me, Sam and Natalie
are in relationships,

06:07.433 --> 06:09.733
we don't have to go to
the event tonight.

06:09.800 --> 06:12.567
I'm buzzing, cos I get to spend
more time with Sam.

06:12.633 --> 06:16.733
I'm gonna be popping along,
making sure youse are all being
good.

06:16.800 --> 06:19.633
Me and Beau have slept together
for the second time,

06:19.700 --> 06:22.633
and I've caught feelings now.
I don't feel single.

06:22.700 --> 06:25.100
Don't feel like
I wanna go to a singles night.

06:25.167 --> 06:27.700
You might see some
familiar faces, as well.

06:27.767 --> 06:29.833
What do you mean?
What do you think?

06:29.900 --> 06:32.133
What's a face, what's familiar?
Fuck off.

06:32.200 --> 06:36.233
If one of these special guests
are Abbie, this could be a
problem.

06:36.300 --> 06:39.433
At the start, Beau and Abbie
necked on and that hurt Bethan,

06:39.500 --> 06:40.933
I don't want that again.

06:42.467 --> 06:46.933
Mate, this is awkward for you.
No, it's work, you gotta go.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.433
What do you mean it's work?

06:48.500 --> 06:51.800
I can't not go to work.
Doesn't mean I've gotta do
anything.

06:51.867 --> 06:53.200
We've got a job to do.

06:53.267 --> 06:55.533
I wish Bethan would give me
a bit of trust.

06:55.600 --> 06:58.367
Nathan, I hope
that you can finally kiss a boy.

06:58.433 --> 07:00.967
I'm not ready to go
to a singles event.

07:01.033 --> 07:02.900
But that's gonna to have to
wait.

07:02.967 --> 07:05.500
I need to see
what's happening with Sophie.

07:05.567 --> 07:07.600
Not gonna beat around the bush
or lie,

07:07.667 --> 07:10.467
people will stick in on youse
both,
not just Beau,

07:10.533 --> 07:12.500
people are gonna stick it in
youse.

07:12.567 --> 07:16.267
Beau turning round and saying,
"Work's work," what does that
mean?

07:16.333 --> 07:18.533
If Anna asked him to neck on
with someone

07:18.600 --> 07:20.467
because work's work, is he
gonna?

07:22.200 --> 07:24.600
What's happened?
That singles event.

07:24.667 --> 07:28.433
What's he said?
"Oh, yeah, well, I'm not
bothered,

07:28.500 --> 07:30.467
"it's just work, you've gotta
go."

07:30.533 --> 07:33.467
Beau's fucked up in the
beginning,
so I can't rule it out

07:33.533 --> 07:35.000
he's not gonna again.

07:35.067 --> 07:38.467
I fell like I've got a rock
in my stomach.

07:38.533 --> 07:40.800
You're proper, like, just
anxious.

07:46.100 --> 07:48.467
Right, it's time for me
to go see Sophie

07:48.533 --> 07:51.600
and bring her back to this house
where she belongs.

07:57.233 --> 07:59.600
A big thing.
We've been in there eight years.

07:59.667 --> 08:00.733
I know.
It's huge.

08:00.800 --> 08:02.867
That's what I was
thinking yesterday,

08:02.933 --> 08:05.400
"My whole 20s
have been in this house."

08:05.467 --> 08:07.033
That's a lot.

08:07.100 --> 08:10.733
I came straight round to
Sophie's
after I'd heard she left the
house.

08:10.800 --> 08:14.233
I know she's been struggling
and I needed to make sure she's
OK.

08:14.300 --> 08:16.100
I literally grew up in that
house,

08:16.167 --> 08:21.133
and now I'm a grown woman, I
don't
want my 30th birthday in that
house

08:21.200 --> 08:23.567
when I could be with the boy I
love.

08:23.633 --> 08:25.900
It is so nice
to catch up with Holly.

08:25.967 --> 08:29.200
'She understands
exactly where I'm coming from.'

08:29.267 --> 08:33.332
She's in a relationship and she
is no longer full-time in the
house.

08:36.299 --> 08:40.033
Sophie left the club, and when
we got home, she wasn't there.

08:40.100 --> 08:43.200
Hello, you.
Nice to see you.

08:43.267 --> 08:44.867
I'm excited to see you, Holly,

08:44.933 --> 08:47.800
but I need to talk to Sophie
about why she left.

08:47.867 --> 08:50.533
You've gotta remember,
Jay came to the house party

08:50.600 --> 08:53.533
and at that point it was like,
"Oh, my God!"

08:53.600 --> 08:57.533
And then, when we were in
Belfast,
I was like, "I wanna leave,"

08:57.600 --> 08:59.333
and then Alex obviously coming,

08:59.400 --> 09:02.533
I was like, "Maybe everything
happens for a reason."

09:02.600 --> 09:04.767
Do you think you'll come back
or what?

09:04.833 --> 09:08.933
Now that I've came home
and I've spoke to Jay,

09:09.000 --> 09:11.233
I look at going part-time,
but for now...

09:11.300 --> 09:12.800
I'd settle for part-time,

09:12.867 --> 09:16.300
but I won't settle for gone.
I'd look into that, like Holly.

09:16.367 --> 09:19.733
Going part-time is a great idea.
You can focus on your boyfriend

09:19.800 --> 09:23.467
and not lose touch with the
family
inside of the house. Win-win.

09:24.967 --> 09:28.100
I don't know, Nathan,
I just think it was my time.

09:28.167 --> 09:29.867
I'm glad I've came to see Sophie

09:29.933 --> 09:32.400
and now I understand
why she wanted to leave,

09:32.467 --> 09:34.500
and it was the right thing for
her.

09:34.567 --> 09:37.667
She is one of my best friends
and I just wanna see her happy.

09:37.733 --> 09:39.433
Love you.
Oh, this is sad.

09:39.500 --> 09:41.200
Bye. Look after other.

09:41.267 --> 09:43.800
I do feel bad leaving the way I
did,

09:43.867 --> 09:48.400
but tomorrow I'm gonna turn up
at the club and surprise
everyone

09:48.467 --> 09:50.433
with some other family members.

09:57.233 --> 10:00.700
Right, time to update the crew
on the Sophie situation.

10:00.767 --> 10:03.800
Hey!
Hey! We've missed you, Nathan.

10:03.867 --> 10:06.567
I've missed youse all.
What have you done?

10:06.633 --> 10:07.733
Went to Sophie's

10:07.800 --> 10:10.033
to see her and Holly.
I'm very jealous.

10:10.100 --> 10:12.133
I hope Nathan is bringing good
news.

10:12.200 --> 10:16.267
She's not 'left' left, that's
what
she wanted me to tell youse all.

10:16.333 --> 10:18.000
She's part-time, like Holly.

10:18.067 --> 10:20.433
Sophie has always been
the mam of the house.

10:20.500 --> 10:23.000
With her gone,
who's gonna look after us all?

10:23.067 --> 10:25.533
Let's fucking get ready for
tonight.
Come on!

10:25.600 --> 10:29.133
Scott is sending all the single
people in the house tonight to
work

10:29.200 --> 10:33.000
before we hit the club, so we
need
to make sure we look fresh as
fuck.

10:41.300 --> 10:44.200
Excited about tonight?
My cock's starting to sweat,

10:44.267 --> 10:45.433
I'm getting nervous.

10:45.500 --> 10:48.367
'It would make my year
if Nathan managed to pull.'

10:48.433 --> 10:52.767
He's been so down and I do feel
like
tonight is the night for him.

10:52.833 --> 10:55.967
I don't know if youse have
thought
about what Scotty said,

10:56.033 --> 10:58.500
there's gonna be
a couple of familiar faces.

10:58.567 --> 11:00.533
I'm not some sort of
fucking genius,

11:00.600 --> 11:03.133
but I'm getting the name
Abbie Holborn.

11:03.200 --> 11:05.667
I don't know if you know, Alex,
when Abbie came

11:05.733 --> 11:09.100
on a night out in Bijoux,
Beau and Abbie started...

11:09.167 --> 11:10.967
Youse necked on, didn't you?
Aye.

11:11.033 --> 11:14.300
Things between me and Bethan
have become complicated

11:14.367 --> 11:16.333
because she doesn't trust us.

11:16.400 --> 11:18.133
This is the shit I didn't want.

11:18.200 --> 11:20.933
(screams)

11:21.000 --> 11:23.667
Rip it, rip it.
Rip it.

11:23.733 --> 11:25.267
(groans)

11:25.333 --> 11:27.667
Let's see how dirty your nose
was.

11:27.733 --> 11:30.633
Oh, my God, that is fucking
vile!

11:37.267 --> 11:38.533
Be honest with us,

11:38.600 --> 11:42.900
what would you do if Beau necked
on
with someone at singles night?

11:42.967 --> 11:44.633
I literally don't know.

11:44.700 --> 11:48.367
I wish I was there for you
tonight.
Oh, it's so annoying.

11:48.433 --> 11:52.167
I don't know how I'm gonna be
able
to watch Beau flirt with other
birds.

11:52.233 --> 11:55.600
This singles event is gonna be
fucking torture for me.

11:58.967 --> 12:00.967
I can't believe I'm necking on.

12:01.033 --> 12:03.167
Shame we are not necking on, eh?
A shame.

12:03.233 --> 12:05.200
Tell the fucking truth!

12:05.267 --> 12:06.967
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye.

12:09.967 --> 12:10.167
.

12:12.700 --> 12:12.900
.

12:21.467 --> 12:24.967
Since me, Chloe and Nat
are all in relationships,

12:25.033 --> 12:28.333
we didn't have to go to work
to the singles event,

12:28.400 --> 12:30.767
but we will be meeting them
later
in the club.

12:39.767 --> 12:41.300
(Nathan) 'Go and smash it.'

12:41.367 --> 12:44.633
We've got to work,
and there is no going back now.

12:44.700 --> 12:47.400
I hope if there's fit lads,
I manage to talk to them.

12:50.600 --> 12:54.500
Adam and Abbie are here. I think
singles night's gonna be fun
then.

12:55.967 --> 12:59.533
I am so excited to be spending
singles night with Nathan and
Adam.

12:59.600 --> 13:01.867
It feels just like the old days

13:01.933 --> 13:03.667
Hi. Are you all right?

13:03.733 --> 13:05.100
Great, Abbie's here.

13:05.167 --> 13:08.367
I can't wait to watch her try
and crack on with Beau again.

13:08.433 --> 13:10.500
This is a fucking singles event.

13:10.567 --> 13:13.433
Youse are looking extra nice,
made loads of effort.

13:13.500 --> 13:16.633
Anna's organised this
and wants these single radgies

13:16.700 --> 13:18.900
to make sure these lot have
a wicked time.

13:18.967 --> 13:21.600
Seems enough.
You never know with these lot.

13:21.667 --> 13:24.867
Are youse all fucking ready?
(all cheer)

13:26.367 --> 13:29.700
When it comes to talking to
boys,
I am so nervous.

13:29.767 --> 13:32.800
The fact I'm stood in front of
four
of youse and like, "Hi!"

13:32.867 --> 13:34.333
I'm in the deep end here.

13:43.433 --> 13:44.633
How old are youse two?

13:44.700 --> 13:46.733
(both) Twenty-three.
How old are you?

13:46.800 --> 13:48.933
How old do you think?
Twelve.

13:49.000 --> 13:52.367
How many 12-year-olds do you
know
with tattoos and a beard?

13:52.433 --> 13:54.733
Hi.
Hello. Hi. You all right?

13:54.800 --> 13:56.567
How are you?
I'm good, thank you.

13:58.367 --> 14:00.100
What's going on?
Nothing much.

14:00.167 --> 14:02.200
What's going on with you?
Not a lot.

14:02.267 --> 14:05.133
Last time I seen Beau
he had his tongue down my
throat,

14:05.200 --> 14:09.267
and it kicked off with Bethan,
so I'm wondering where things
stand.

14:09.333 --> 14:12.067
You've come to a singles night,
are youse together?

14:12.133 --> 14:14.700
We are not together,
but obviously we've had...

14:14.767 --> 14:16.567
We are getting together, so...

14:16.633 --> 14:20.300
It is awkward talking to Abbie.
I
feel Bethan's watching my every
move

14:20.367 --> 14:22.800
and burning a hole
in the back of my head.

14:22.867 --> 14:26.933
When you're in this house and
you
get with a lad, it's so intense.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.667
Cos youse are living with each
other. It's weird.

14:29.733 --> 14:32.300
I hope Bethan doesn't think
I'm making a move,

14:32.367 --> 14:36.400
cos I just miss being in the
house
and wanna know what's been going
on.

14:36.467 --> 14:40.033
I think you need to be careful
and just think about what you
want.

14:40.100 --> 14:42.733
I need to think about what I
want.
Been a pleasure.

14:42.800 --> 14:44.167
It's been an honour.

14:44.233 --> 14:46.800
Shame we're not necking on.
It's a shame.

14:46.867 --> 14:49.100
If I wasn't in this situation
with Bethan,

14:49.167 --> 14:51.633
maybe me and Abbie
could've had some fun,

14:51.700 --> 14:54.267
but that's definitely off the
cards.
Shame.

15:00.833 --> 15:03.533
I need to get over my nerves
when talking to guys.

15:03.600 --> 15:08.333
It's not great, but asking
stupid
questions is sort of a
conversation.

15:08.400 --> 15:11.633
Describe yourself as ice cream.

15:11.700 --> 15:13.233
That's one of my favourites.

15:13.300 --> 15:17.400
It's working, we're talking.
This is actually quite fun.

15:17.467 --> 15:22.467
So, I would describe myself
as caramel sundae with no cream.

15:23.933 --> 15:25.433
Yeah, put a wafer in as well.

15:25.500 --> 15:29.033
I am not gonna lie, Cameron is
the best-looking person in the
room,

15:29.100 --> 15:31.033
and he's got good tattoos.

15:31.100 --> 15:33.367
But God, this is nerve-wracking.

15:35.133 --> 15:37.467
There'll be no chocolate sauce
for you, sir.

15:39.467 --> 15:41.167
My face is so unsymmetrical,

15:41.233 --> 15:44.933
so one side I look like a
monkey,
and the other side I look nice.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.133
You're fucking mad, you.

15:47.200 --> 15:50.800
I'm gutted I'm not in the house,
especially now I've met Tahlia.

15:50.867 --> 15:53.133
I'm gonna hit her with my best
chat-up line.

15:57.067 --> 16:00.233
Adam's chat-up lines are a bit
shit,
but he is pretty funny

16:00.300 --> 16:02.333
and I do fancy him a little bit.

16:09.067 --> 16:11.533
If you went to go buy a car,
right,

16:11.600 --> 16:13.767
you'd test drive the car,
wouldn't you?

16:13.833 --> 16:17.800
Oh, my God. Here's my chance.
It's now or never.

16:17.867 --> 16:20.267
Would you like to give me a
kiss?
Howay, then.

16:21.900 --> 16:24.867
It's happening!
I can't believe I'm necking on.

16:26.067 --> 16:28.067
'Who the fuck am I,
where have I been?'

16:28.133 --> 16:29.833
This is the new me. I love him.

16:31.167 --> 16:32.267
Not him, me.

16:33.333 --> 16:37.233
(Abbie) 'I am absolutely buzzing
that Nathan has pulled.'

16:37.300 --> 16:40.333
I feel like it is definitely
gonna boost his confidence.

16:40.400 --> 16:43.133
I would like to invite you out
on another night out.

16:43.200 --> 16:45.367
Would you come out with us
For certain.

16:45.433 --> 16:48.167
Suck his cock!
Shut the fuck up, Abbie man.

16:48.233 --> 16:51.867
I can't believe I got over my
nerves
and necked on with a boy,

16:51.933 --> 16:54.333
but now we need to tell the
others.

16:57.833 --> 17:01.767
I'm glad Adam and Abbie are out
with
us tonight, it's like old times.

17:05.767 --> 17:09.099
(Chloe) 'Here is everyone from
work,
and Abbie's with them.'

17:09.166 --> 17:13.032
I hope to God nothing has kicked
off
between Abbie, Bethan and Beau.

17:15.767 --> 17:19.200
Oh, my God! Adam is here!
I am fucking buzzing.

17:35.867 --> 17:39.367
I need to find out what happened
at work between Beau and Bethan.

17:40.933 --> 17:43.300
I saw Beau and Abbie talking at
work

17:43.367 --> 17:47.700
and I don't know what they were
saying, but it did look
innocent.

17:49.200 --> 17:51.067
Yeah, I know.

18:02.533 --> 18:05.833
I know I'm younger than Nathan,
but I feel like a proud parent!

18:12.867 --> 18:15.733
I'm actually a bit shy
telling Sam about Cameron,

18:15.800 --> 18:19.100
but I love how close we've
become
this time around,

18:19.167 --> 18:22.267
and I don't think I would've got
this far without him.

18:37.467 --> 18:39.167
'I am buzzing for Nathan.'

18:39.233 --> 18:43.667
He's been through so much
heartache
since his ex and now he's moving
on.

18:50.567 --> 18:54.333
Sam's right. Up until now
I wasn't fully over my ex,

18:54.400 --> 18:55.867
but after tonight,

18:55.933 --> 18:59.100
I felt more independent
than I have in a long time.

19:08.300 --> 19:11.633
I was really stressed about
me and Beau going to work today,

19:11.700 --> 19:15.500
but it turned out fine, and I
don't
know what I was so worried
about.

19:17.667 --> 19:20.467
I'm a bit gutted about
Bethan's lack of trust earlier

19:20.533 --> 19:23.667
and I'm wary about getting
too serious, too fast,

19:23.733 --> 19:25.933
but she's just
so fucking irresistible.

19:32.200 --> 19:34.933
Last time I seen Abbie,
I accidentally swilled her,

19:35.000 --> 19:37.033
I need to make sure
me and her are cush.

19:44.333 --> 19:46.700
I'm worried that Beau
is mugging off Bethan,

19:46.767 --> 19:50.133
so I need to tell Chloe what he
said
earlier, see what she thinks.

20:00.333 --> 20:03.700
I don't understand why Beau
would say that if he likes
Bethan.

20:03.767 --> 20:06.833
I need to tell her, I don't want
her
to kick off in the club,

20:06.900 --> 20:08.867
so I'm gonna wait until I get
home.

20:13.433 --> 20:14.533
Oh, it's fine.

20:22.567 --> 20:28.000
Adam isn't my usual type, but
he's
good craic and I fancy a neck
on.

20:29.933 --> 20:33.300
I thought Tahlia said her type
was tall, dark and handsome?

20:33.367 --> 20:35.600
Adam's small, orange and ginger!

20:43.500 --> 20:45.800
It's been great hanging out
with everyone,

20:45.867 --> 20:48.300
but my taxi's outside,
so I'm heading home.

20:52.933 --> 20:54.267
I've had a wicked night,

20:54.333 --> 20:57.033
hopefully I get to see Tahlia
again sometime soon,

20:57.100 --> 20:59.867
but for now,
it's time for me to leave.

21:10.400 --> 21:12.133
I couldn't keep it in any
longer.

21:12.200 --> 21:15.800
I have told Tahlia, but I'm
still
not gonna tell Bethan yet.

21:18.133 --> 21:20.867
I know Bethan isn't gonna wanna
hear
what Beau said,

21:20.933 --> 21:22.800
but I feel like she should know.

21:33.367 --> 21:34.700
What the fuck?

21:34.767 --> 21:37.500
Beau's got some serious
explaining
to do, like.

21:43.133 --> 21:45.867
Shit. Bethan's kicking off,
again.

21:55.000 --> 21:59.167
Is that his idea of a joke?
Well, it's not fucking funny.

21:59.233 --> 22:01.967
Do you wanna crack on with
Abbie,
do you?

22:02.033 --> 22:03.800
Do you wanna crack on with
Abbie?

22:03.867 --> 22:05.833
Whatever you want.
I'm asking you!

22:05.900 --> 22:08.267
There's no point
trying to reason with her.

22:08.333 --> 22:12.100
I'm gonna remove myself before
I say something I'm gonna
regret.

22:12.167 --> 22:15.800
Why?! What's he on about?
Ask Chloe, ask Chloe.

22:15.867 --> 22:18.500
What did he say?
He wants to crack on with Abbie?

22:18.567 --> 22:21.033
Who told you?
Her! She just told me.

22:21.100 --> 22:23.300
I was gonna tell you
when I got home.

22:23.367 --> 22:26.600
I knew Bethan was gonna kick off
like this when she found out.

22:26.667 --> 22:28.767
I feel so, so bad for her.

22:28.833 --> 22:30.967
He wished he was cracking on
with Abbie.

22:31.033 --> 22:34.767
Listen, let's get back to the
house
and let's talk about it in the
cars.

22:34.833 --> 22:37.600
Usually it's Sophie
making sure everyone's OK,

22:37.667 --> 22:41.267
but now I feel like I need to
step up and be the sensible one.

22:45.800 --> 22:48.300
Howay, Nat, we all know
how to get into a car.

22:48.367 --> 22:50.133
Stop trying to mother us, mate.

22:50.200 --> 22:52.333
You get in the back with Chlo.

22:52.400 --> 22:55.533
I'll get in the front, youse two
get in the back. I'll get it.

22:55.600 --> 22:57.233
Youse two get in.

22:57.300 --> 22:59.267
Come on, let's go, let's go,
let's go.

22:59.333 --> 23:01.567
I've had a mint night,
but let's go home

23:01.633 --> 23:04.400
before it all goes west
and there's more kick-offs.

23:04.467 --> 23:06.200
Get in.
Fucking messing about.

23:06.267 --> 23:10.033
Boys, in the taxi! Hey!

23:19.133 --> 23:22.700
I know that Beau is about to
walk through that door any
moment,

23:22.767 --> 23:26.233
and I'm still fuming, but
there's
no escaping him in this house.

23:28.500 --> 23:30.900
I don't know what the fuck
is waiting for me.

23:30.967 --> 23:32.800
I'm guessing it's no good,
though.

23:32.867 --> 23:35.900
Why is getting with someone you
live with so complicated?

23:37.467 --> 23:39.367
Why is the milk there?

23:39.433 --> 23:43.633
I'm waiting for an explanation
from
Beau about what he said to
Abbie.

23:43.700 --> 23:47.000
It a shame you couldn't get
with Abbie? Is that what you
said?

23:47.067 --> 23:49.067
I can tell by the look on
Bethan's face

23:49.133 --> 23:51.933
that whatever I say,
it's not gonna be good enough.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.767
Tell the fucking truth now!

23:54.833 --> 23:57.333
Why can't he say something?

24:00.900 --> 24:05.067
Why the milk? Everyone in this
house
is gonna want tea in the
morning.

24:05.133 --> 24:07.167
Don't do that behind my back

24:07.233 --> 24:11.033
and then neck on with me
as if everything's OK.

24:11.100 --> 24:14.900
This is why girls are insecure,
because you get lads like Beau

24:14.967 --> 24:16.267
that ladge lasses.

24:16.333 --> 24:18.900
Your tattoos are fucking shit
tribal fuck.

24:18.967 --> 24:22.067
Tonight has been ladgeful.
I think we should go to bed

24:22.133 --> 24:23.833
and deal with it in the morning.

24:23.900 --> 24:28.200
He's gonna sit there and laugh
it off
because he's guilty as fuck.

24:35.300 --> 24:37.733
I've finally necked on with a
boy,

24:37.800 --> 24:42.033
and instead of celebrating,
everyone
has gone to bed in a shit mood.

24:42.100 --> 24:45.267
I wish Sophie was here,
cos she would've celebrated with
me.

24:47.667 --> 24:49.567
Going to bed.
Fucking get off me.

24:53.667 --> 24:55.833
Been thinking
what I can do for Chloe.

24:55.900 --> 24:57.600
"You make me so proud."

24:57.667 --> 24:59.733
I am literally in shock.

24:59.800 --> 25:01.633
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye.

25:04.467 --> 25:04.667
.

25:07.200 --> 25:07.400
.

25:28.900 --> 25:30.933
How are you?
I'm solid.

25:32.100 --> 25:35.167
What's going on, then?
Tell us the verdict of last
night.

25:35.233 --> 25:37.200
Mate, I don't even know, to be
fair.

25:37.267 --> 25:40.367
In the words of Katy Perry,
I kissed a boy and I liked it,

25:40.433 --> 25:43.267
and it was all ruined
by Bethan kicking off.

25:44.667 --> 25:48.133
The worst thing is, though,
I do like the girl, she is sound

25:48.200 --> 25:50.800
and I do get on with her.
I'm not gonna get swilled,

25:50.867 --> 25:53.000
I'm not gonna get talked to
like that.

25:53.067 --> 25:57.067
Being swilled by milk is the
worst
thing, you will smell of cheese.

25:57.133 --> 25:58.300
Milk was not the one.

25:58.367 --> 25:59.933
The fact Bethan's pissed off

26:00.000 --> 26:04.400
when I've done fuck all and has
not
given me trust made me doubt
things.

26:04.467 --> 26:06.567
I have done nothing wrong.

26:06.633 --> 26:10.600
I did say that to Abbie, and I
swear
to God I'm not lying, it was
banter.

26:10.667 --> 26:14.367
You were joking. She needs to
calm
down, you're not her property.

26:14.433 --> 26:18.567
Beau is learning it's impossible
to shag a girl in this house

26:18.633 --> 26:21.133
and have a simple life.
I feel sorry for the guy.

26:21.200 --> 26:23.367
Do you know what I really miss?

26:23.433 --> 26:25.700
Sophie's omelettes.
I miss Sophie.

26:28.067 --> 26:29.567
How you feeling?

26:29.633 --> 26:32.433
Oh, mate.
(Sam) What actually happened?

26:32.500 --> 26:36.533
Abbie told me that Beau said,
"It's a shame we're not necking
on."

26:36.600 --> 26:39.100
I woke up this morning,
I feel so bad for Bethan.

26:39.167 --> 26:41.367
She did kick off,
but I would do the same.

26:41.433 --> 26:43.333
What Beau did was out of order.

26:43.400 --> 26:45.300
So, where is your head at with
Beau?

26:45.367 --> 26:47.533
Well, obviously,
I need to speak to him,

26:47.600 --> 26:52.767
but as far as I'm concerned,
it's not going very well.

26:52.833 --> 26:55.733
In fairness, though,
he didn't crack on with anybody.

26:55.800 --> 26:59.767
I might have overreacted last
night.
I should have never have swilled
him,

26:59.833 --> 27:02.433
but when you're living in a
house
24/7 with a boy,

27:02.500 --> 27:04.167
everything is more intense.

27:04.233 --> 27:07.600
Excuse me, do you want some
bitty?
Yeah.

27:07.667 --> 27:11.067
Since Belfast, me and Chloe have
been getting our relationship

27:11.133 --> 27:12.167
back on track,

27:12.233 --> 27:14.100
and I'm gonna do something
special

27:14.167 --> 27:17.000
to show her
how much she means to me.

27:17.067 --> 27:20.433
Tahlia, there is a pube in the
bed.
You slept on that last night.

27:20.500 --> 27:22.200
Do you wanna make a wish?
Yeah.

27:23.467 --> 27:25.700
What did you wish for?
I'm not telling you.

27:34.033 --> 27:37.767
I was worried I'd wake up
regretting necking on with
Cameron,

27:37.833 --> 27:39.267
but I don't regret it.

27:39.333 --> 27:43.600
In fact, I'm gonna invite him
out
tonight with us, and I can't
wait.

27:47.567 --> 27:50.600
"I love that you are
the mother to my dog."

27:51.967 --> 27:54.367
I've been thinking
what I can do for Chloe

27:54.433 --> 27:57.700
to make her realise how much
I want our relationship to work,

27:57.767 --> 28:02.933
and I think I've come up with
the best idea ever.

28:08.833 --> 28:12.533
It is a bit of a weird one,
but I'm hoping that she'll like
it.

28:17.567 --> 28:19.833
Chloe, come with me.

28:19.900 --> 28:23.500
I really hope I've got this
right
and it makes Chloe feel amazing,

28:23.567 --> 28:25.567
because she deserves it.

28:27.900 --> 28:30.533
Take a seat.
You're not gonna engage, are
you?

28:30.600 --> 28:31.600
Got a surprise.

28:31.667 --> 28:34.667
I'm not sure surprises
are Sam's strong point.

28:34.733 --> 28:37.267
I just hope
he's not after my bumhole again.

28:37.333 --> 28:39.767
I've made loads of little notes
in here.

28:39.833 --> 28:44.600
You know how you always put
yourself
down, but you don't need to,

28:44.667 --> 28:47.500
cos to me you are the best
girlfriend
in the world.

28:47.567 --> 28:51.100
I'm getting upset.
Don't get upset, you freak.

28:51.167 --> 28:53.133
This is just nice.

28:53.200 --> 28:56.900
I'm not actually sure
how well this is going so far.

28:56.967 --> 29:00.400
So, you need to open one of
these
every single day,

29:00.467 --> 29:02.300
to make yourself feel better.

29:02.367 --> 29:05.467
Cos you need to realise
you are the best person in the
world.

29:05.533 --> 29:09.133
I want you to start by reading
this.
This is you one for today.

29:10.900 --> 29:12.367
Read it out loud.

29:13.833 --> 29:16.133
"You honestly make me so
proud...

29:18.233 --> 29:21.000
"...with everything
that you have achieved."

29:24.867 --> 29:26.367
I am literally in shock.

29:26.433 --> 29:30.267
I did not think that Sam was
capable
of anything like this.

29:34.767 --> 29:36.767
Why is it on
the back of a toothpaste?

29:36.833 --> 29:39.067
Cos that's all I could find.

29:42.067 --> 29:44.433
Aw, it's so nice of you.

29:44.500 --> 29:46.967
I'm not crying,
I'm crying cos I am laughing.

29:47.033 --> 29:49.167
I'm crying cos I'm laughing.

29:49.233 --> 29:52.467
I promise you,
I am not crying at all!

29:54.267 --> 29:55.533
OK, maybe a little bit.

29:55.600 --> 29:59.667
You are the most important
person in
the world. You mean everything
to me,

29:59.733 --> 30:03.367
so I want you to really believe
in
yourself, and these could do
that.

30:03.433 --> 30:04.500
I like how you...

30:04.567 --> 30:08.733
I finally feel like Sam gets us,
and this is all I've ever
wanted.

30:08.800 --> 30:11.533
Honestly, this is the happiest
I have ever been.

30:11.600 --> 30:15.167
This is the thoughtfulest thing
anyone has done for us.

30:15.233 --> 30:18.633
Be careful, there's an egg in
it.
OK.

30:18.700 --> 30:20.367
This has worked a treat,

30:20.433 --> 30:23.633
and hopefully every single time
Chloe reads one of her notes

30:23.700 --> 30:25.600
it'll bring a smile to her face.

30:25.667 --> 30:28.200
Did you actually just cry?
No, I was laughing.

30:28.267 --> 30:30.067
I was proper laughing, yeah.
Why?

30:30.133 --> 30:32.433
I was laughing with happiness.

30:34.600 --> 30:37.300
Fuck!
I'm very sorry, I just dropped
it.

30:37.367 --> 30:39.967
I'm gonna put it back in.
I'm so sorry!

30:40.033 --> 30:42.200
I think it's best
we go and get ready.

30:50.400 --> 30:54.467
I have just literally had
the nicest chat ever with Sam.

30:54.533 --> 30:58.067
He gave us this pineapple. It's
not
much, but this is what I wanted.

30:58.133 --> 31:03.067
It's all so personal, as well.
He's physically made that all
day.

31:03.133 --> 31:06.167
That's worth so much more
than buying an actual present.

31:06.233 --> 31:10.267
Not only is Sam being proper
sweet,
he's also being quite
resourceful,

31:10.333 --> 31:14.967
he's written on eggs
and snooker balls and tampons.

31:15.033 --> 31:18.033
I mean, it's not that romantic,
but it is canny.

31:18.100 --> 31:22.733
You and Beau need to sort
things,
so I need to know what you want.

31:22.800 --> 31:27.667
What I would want is for us to
sort
it out and just go back to
normal.

31:27.733 --> 31:30.567
I think me and Beau
can work things out tonight.

31:30.633 --> 31:33.800
I just need to apologise
for going overboard last night,

31:33.867 --> 31:35.700
then work things out from there.

31:35.767 --> 31:39.133
But I need to tell him that I am
upset about what he said to
Abbie.

31:43.967 --> 31:46.333
What is happening with you two?

31:46.400 --> 31:49.800
As soon as I get to the club I'm
gonna have to pull her to one
side

31:49.867 --> 31:52.633
and set the record straight,
do you know what I mean?

31:52.700 --> 31:55.267
She can't be going on like that.
I'm not with her.

31:55.333 --> 31:58.833
If I'm honest, I'm scared I'm
getting in too deep with Bethan.

31:58.900 --> 32:00.767
I have been hurt in
relationships,

32:00.833 --> 32:03.667
what I didn't want
was to get too serious, too
fast.

32:07.333 --> 32:09.700
I'm excited to go out,
I'm excited to neck on,

32:09.767 --> 32:12.367
I'm excited to talk to a boy,
excited to be weird,

32:12.433 --> 32:14.567
I'm just...
You're very excited.

32:14.633 --> 32:16.800
I'm excited
Cameron's gonna be coming,

32:16.867 --> 32:21.933
and I hope this lot keep it
together
and are on their best behaviour.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.833
Stop chit-chatting,
we've got gay clubs to get to.

32:24.900 --> 32:27.800
Right, I'm gonna go and hoy
a load of washing in,

32:27.867 --> 32:31.033
so who wants what done?
The bag's just there, the whole
bag.

32:31.100 --> 32:32.200
Yeah.

32:32.267 --> 32:35.700
It's a bit weird that Nat
actually wants to do the
washing.

32:35.767 --> 32:40.100
I'm not gonna say no,
but I do feel a bit guilty.

32:43.867 --> 32:45.733
Girls!

32:45.800 --> 32:46.833
I'm very excited.

32:46.900 --> 32:49.733
I can't wait to get out tonight
to meet Cameron.

32:49.800 --> 32:54.300
It should be a good one. I just
hope
it doesn't kick off again.

32:54.367 --> 32:58.500
A toast to the big gay night
out.
(all cheer)

32:58.567 --> 33:00.700
These lot are still my family.

33:03.633 --> 33:04.867
I'm hurt!

33:04.933 --> 33:06.933
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye.

33:09.933 --> 33:10.133
.

33:12.667 --> 33:12.867
.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.900
Let's do it!
That was weird.

33:26.967 --> 33:28.200
Come on, guys.

33:34.467 --> 33:38.600
We get to Powerhouse and
everyone
is in good spirits. Pass me a
peev!

33:48.333 --> 33:52.700
Everyone's having a laugh, I
can't
help be nervous, Cameron's
coming.

33:52.767 --> 33:56.433
I just want him to get here now
and get it over and done with.

34:03.067 --> 34:05.667
Me and Beau
still haven't sorted things out,

34:05.733 --> 34:09.100
and no matter what,
I've promised I'm not gonna kick
off.

34:11.533 --> 34:13.900
Me and Bethan have gotta
sort things out,

34:13.967 --> 34:18.033
but sure she's gonna like what
I've got to say, so I'm in no
hurry.

34:19.533 --> 34:21.632
Yeah! Tequila!

34:21.699 --> 34:22.800
I love you!

34:29.433 --> 34:30.900
Yes, it's my girls!

34:30.967 --> 34:33.300
(all cheer)

34:33.367 --> 34:36.000
Leaving the house
was the right decision for me,

34:36.067 --> 34:38.433
but these lot are still my
family,

34:38.500 --> 34:41.400
and I wanna find out
how Nathan is coping without us.

34:43.233 --> 34:47.800
It's great being out with these
guys.
It's reminding me of the old
times.

34:47.867 --> 34:50.567
Old faces, new faces,
it's absolutely mint.

34:55.132 --> 34:58.100
I get the vibe from Beau he
wants
to stay out of trouble,

34:58.167 --> 35:00.033
so I'm gonna steer clear for
now.

35:04.967 --> 35:07.433
I love Holly, Abbie and Sophie,

35:07.500 --> 35:10.967
so to have them here tonight
means more to me than anything.

35:21.267 --> 35:22.900
I'm so proud of Nathan.

35:22.967 --> 35:26.500
I thought that me leaving
might make him go into his
shell,

35:26.567 --> 35:29.200
but that boy
has came out of his shell.

35:45.667 --> 35:49.633
I am literally on cloud nine.
That
pineapple has cheered me right
up.

35:55.833 --> 35:59.667
I feel like the pineapple
has definitely done the trick.

35:59.733 --> 36:01.267
Need to buy more pineapples.

36:11.133 --> 36:14.533
Fuck! He's turned up at the
club.
I thought he wasn't gonna come.

36:14.600 --> 36:15.600
What do I do?

36:16.500 --> 36:19.433
"Hi, Cameron."
(cheering)

36:19.500 --> 36:21.267
This is Cameron.

36:21.333 --> 36:24.033
Cameron, this is Tahlia,
this is Sam.

36:24.100 --> 36:27.633
'This is so weird, me
introducing
a boy to the family.'

36:27.700 --> 36:31.867
I have never done this before,
but it feels very nice.

36:40.833 --> 36:43.900
It's been so long
since someone's said they fancy
me

36:43.967 --> 36:46.567
and it's making me act really
weird.

36:47.700 --> 36:51.000
Yeah, it's happened,
I've lost the ability to speak,

36:51.067 --> 36:53.900
so I'm gonna have to find
another way to communicate.

36:59.100 --> 37:02.867
Oh, my God, I cannot believe it.
Nathan, kissing a boy,

37:02.933 --> 37:04.700
and he's actually quite fit!

37:07.467 --> 37:11.400
Oh, my God, this is such a big
moment
for Nathan and the house.

37:11.467 --> 37:13.200
Get in there, son.

37:16.200 --> 37:18.733
I don't actually know anything
about Cameron,

37:18.800 --> 37:21.600
what's his favourite colour,
where does he work,

37:21.667 --> 37:23.200
what's his favourite food.

37:23.267 --> 37:26.333
All I do know is that his mouth
tastes incredibly nice!

37:37.133 --> 37:39.467
I need to bite the bullet
and speak to Beau,

37:39.533 --> 37:42.300
because I can't stand
living like this anymore.

37:59.600 --> 38:02.800
I don't know why Bethan's making
such a big issue about this.

38:02.867 --> 38:04.733
It's not like I necked on with
her.

38:13.067 --> 38:15.700
It is like pulling teeth
trying to talk to Beau.

38:15.767 --> 38:18.467
I'm being open about my feelings
and how I'm hurt

38:18.533 --> 38:21.533
and he's not giving us anything
back.

38:26.000 --> 38:29.900
I came into this house a single
girl
and I wasn't looking for anyone,

38:29.967 --> 38:35.933
but me and Beau have really
clicked
and now I'm sat here and I'm
hurt

38:36.000 --> 38:37.400
and I didn't wanna be!

38:47.767 --> 38:49.633
Right now, I need some space,

38:49.700 --> 38:53.433
and the only way to get that
is to put a stop to me and
Bethan.

39:07.200 --> 39:10.200
I feel so bad for Bethan.
I hate seeing my friend upset.

39:15.067 --> 39:19.433
If Beau really liked us, why is
he
just throwing it away like that?

39:19.500 --> 39:22.100
If I really like someone,
I make it work.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.800
This is such an awful situation
for Bethan.

39:30.867 --> 39:34.100
Her relationship with Beau is
over
before it even started.

39:38.500 --> 39:42.367
Beau's ended things with Bethan,
he's done the right thing for
now,

39:42.433 --> 39:45.700
because it's started
to affect everyone.

39:59.133 --> 40:03.000
Right, no more moping around.
I'm gonna do some sexy dance
moves

40:03.067 --> 40:05.267
and hopefully drive Beau crazy.

40:17.900 --> 40:22.833
Cameron has gotta go, and I
don't
think I'm ready to invite him
back,

40:22.900 --> 40:26.367
but I am so proud of myself
for getting this far with a lad.

40:29.967 --> 40:33.633
I have had a mint night and it
is
nice to see Nathan in a good
place.

40:33.700 --> 40:37.433
He's necking on like there's no
tomorrow! We need go out more
often.

40:41.800 --> 40:43.600
I have had so much fun tonight.

40:43.667 --> 40:47.400
I think I could get used to
being part-time.

40:57.267 --> 41:00.733
Alex is being flirty with me,
and I don't fancy him,

41:00.800 --> 41:03.200
but I wanna show Beau
what he's missing.

41:05.067 --> 41:07.633
I can see Bethan and Alex
all over each other.

41:07.700 --> 41:10.267
Trying to piss me off.
I'm not gonna rise to it.

41:10.333 --> 41:12.500
I want a kiss on the cheek.

41:13.867 --> 41:16.233
Tonight's been great,
and call me crazy,

41:16.300 --> 41:19.000
but Bethan's got a little
twinkle
in her eye for me.

41:19.067 --> 41:22.233
Sorry, Beau, but a man's gotta
do
what a man's gotta do.

41:22.300 --> 41:24.000
Lets fucking go home.

41:24.067 --> 41:29.667
Let's go home, let's go home,
let's go home!

41:29.733 --> 41:32.500
For me, tonight couldn't have
gone
any better,

41:32.567 --> 41:35.467
now let's get out of this club
and go home.

41:43.667 --> 41:45.100
We want some pussy!

41:45.167 --> 41:49.133
We get back to the house, and
I'm
so proud of Nathan for necking
on

41:49.200 --> 41:51.133
and for Bethan for not kicking
off.

41:51.200 --> 41:55.133
Why did he not come back with
you?
To be fair, his friends...

41:55.200 --> 41:59.700
He said his friends were in the
club
and I was fine with that,

41:59.767 --> 42:01.767
and didn't wanna bring him back.

42:01.833 --> 42:04.833
Are you happy it happened?
I'm good, I've had a good time.

42:04.900 --> 42:08.133
I'm like, "Hey!"

42:08.200 --> 42:13.433
I've had such a good night,
seeing
Cameron and Sophie, Holly and
Abbie.

42:13.500 --> 42:16.567
This feels like the beginning
of a new chapter in my life.

42:16.633 --> 42:19.600
I live with a bunch of heathens.

42:20.900 --> 42:23.700
(Nat) 'I can't believe
everyone else has crashed.'

42:23.767 --> 42:26.100
Howay!
These towels won't fold
themselves.

42:32.933 --> 42:36.267
Today, Sam has literally been
the best boyfriend ever,

42:36.333 --> 42:40.733
so to celebrate, tonight we're
gonna make some sweet love!

42:47.767 --> 42:49.867
Trying to work things out
with Bethan

42:49.933 --> 42:52.200
in this house
is way harder than I thought.

42:52.267 --> 42:54.567
I wish things
had turned out differently.

42:57.567 --> 43:00.533
I am absolutely gutted
how things have gone with Beau.

43:00.600 --> 43:02.333
I guess it's just not meant to
be.

43:02.400 --> 43:04.633
I need to go to sleep
and forget about it.

43:13.933 --> 43:16.733
Why don't I cook us all
a nice family meal?

43:16.800 --> 43:20.267
Girls, are youse coming down?
Two seconds!

43:20.333 --> 43:21.500
She's like a mam.

43:21.567 --> 43:23.567
It's unfair how everyone's went
on.

43:23.633 --> 43:26.133
Take you shopping.
Good for when we have kids.

43:26.200 --> 43:28.367
We don't have kids.
Had the best day ever!

43:31.067 --> 43:33.333
The three of us can be a tripod.

43:34.467 --> 43:37.233
Beau has just managed
to shut his feelings off.

43:38.667 --> 43:41.700
I've been hurt in the past,
I'm not sure if I wanna go back.

43:41.767 --> 43:44.633
I'm sick of being upset.
The girl is besotted by you.

43:44.700 --> 43:48.367
I can't just go jumping back
into
it, that's not how it works.

44:13.433 --> 44:13.633
.
