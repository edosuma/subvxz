WEBVTT

00:11.804 --> 00:13.305
I see we all made it.

00:15.098 --> 00:16.517
Let's begin.

00:19.061 --> 00:21.564
So, any issues I should know about?

00:21.647 --> 00:23.899
The intel on my host was way off the mark,

00:23.982 --> 00:25.483
but I'm handling it.

00:26.985 --> 00:29.738
We all knew assuming the lives
of people from another century

00:29.822 --> 00:31.824
wasn't going to be a walk in the park.

00:31.907 --> 00:34.117
Actually, you should try
a walk in the park sometime.

00:34.201 --> 00:35.243
It's lovely.

00:35.327 --> 00:36.829
Thanks.
I'll do that.

00:36.912 --> 00:38.914
All coms are set for voice activation.

00:39.832 --> 00:40.999
All good?

00:41.083 --> 00:42.835
Yeah.
Loud and clear.

00:42.918 --> 00:44.377
When'd you have a chance to build coms?

00:44.461 --> 00:45.545
After school.

00:46.254 --> 00:47.756
Okay. Ready?

00:48.506 --> 00:49.507
Freeze!

01:01.353 --> 01:03.313
The material's safer where it is.

01:03.396 --> 01:05.398
Dr. Delaney,
the entire power grid is down,

01:05.482 --> 01:08.235
and your emergency backups aren't designed
to last for more than a few hours.

01:08.318 --> 01:10.153
Your transport unit is untested.

01:10.237 --> 01:12.781
The road vibration alone
could cause containment failure.

01:12.865 --> 01:15.325
Any distance we manage to take it
is better than here.

01:15.408 --> 01:16.910
Bullshit.

01:16.994 --> 01:19.788
This isn't about safety.
You want a new weapon.

01:19.871 --> 01:22.040
<i>We're ready to load up, Major.</i>

01:22.124 --> 01:23.291
Copy.

01:23.375 --> 01:24.584
Doctor.

01:27.796 --> 01:30.340
- Agent MacLaren?
- Yes?

01:30.423 --> 01:33.093
You called in that you were in pursuit
of a suspect. Do you need backup?

01:33.176 --> 01:34.803
Yes.
We were forced to take him out.

01:34.887 --> 01:37.765
I was.
That's the body over there.

01:37.848 --> 01:40.267
There's also a police officer
locked out on the roof.

01:40.350 --> 01:41.601
Okay.
We can take it from here.

01:41.685 --> 01:42.728
- Got it.
- All right.

01:44.562 --> 01:46.189
I'm Traveler 3185.

01:46.982 --> 01:48.566
This is your containment unit.
You can trust it.

01:48.651 --> 01:50.110
I thought we were meeting en route.

01:50.193 --> 01:52.279
No plan survives contact with the past.
You must be new.

01:52.362 --> 01:55.240
Yeah, six minutes ago.
How's that for timing?

01:55.323 --> 01:57.200
Go save the world.

01:57.284 --> 01:58.410
Thanks.

01:59.327 --> 02:00.537
No pressure.

02:37.157 --> 02:39.785
<i>The convoy is approaching our location.</i>

02:39.868 --> 02:42.245
<i>Copy. We're getting in position.</i>

02:50.670 --> 02:52.297
<i>They're passing us now.</i>

02:55.300 --> 02:57.135
Major, the containment unit.

02:57.803 --> 02:59.805
It's failing.

03:00.638 --> 03:01.639
What?

03:03.183 --> 03:04.935
We're detecting micro-annihilations.

03:05.018 --> 03:06.895
-So she was right.
-I wouldn't say that, sir.

03:07.645 --> 03:09.106
But we won't make it to our facility.

03:09.898 --> 03:12.692
We're looking at an explosion
in the megaton range.

03:12.776 --> 03:13.944
Stop the convoy.

03:17.239 --> 03:19.742
<i>At this point,</i>
<i>an antimatter detonation is inevitable.</i>

03:19.825 --> 03:22.745
I want everyone to turn around
and get as far away from here as you can.

03:22.828 --> 03:24.496
<i>Copy that, Major!</i>

03:24.579 --> 03:25.998
- Wilson!
- Sir.

03:27.207 --> 03:29.042
The road ahead's clear.

03:29.126 --> 03:30.544
I'll be following just behind.

03:30.627 --> 03:31.795
We'll take it as far as we can.

03:31.879 --> 03:32.921
Go. I'll catch up.

03:44.474 --> 03:45.976
You're not following him?

03:55.110 --> 03:56.111
What?

03:58.405 --> 04:00.866
Nothing.
I'm just looking you over.

04:05.453 --> 04:08.665
Well, he looks like his picture.

04:11.459 --> 04:13.711
So how do you feel about older men?

04:13.795 --> 04:16.631
I asked myself that
this morning.

04:16.714 --> 04:19.009
-Agent MacLaren came to see me.
-What?

04:19.927 --> 04:21.762
He's a lot like you.

04:21.845 --> 04:24.181
So much, I almost thought
I was talking to you.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.809
Well, not as charming, I bet.

04:26.892 --> 04:28.476
Oh, no, he was charming.

04:29.561 --> 04:32.815
It even crossed my mind
to warn him not to follow us tonight.

04:32.898 --> 04:36.819
Well, the next available host candidate
was a morbidly obese meat salesman,

04:36.902 --> 04:39.071
so thanks for keeping
that thought to yourself.

04:42.074 --> 04:43.283
Well...

04:44.242 --> 04:45.911
this one's too soft.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.746
Or do you like that?

04:48.831 --> 04:51.792
I don't think there's a safe answer
to that question.

04:54.336 --> 04:56.839
<i>Containment truck</i>
<i>historically one minute out.</i>

04:56.922 --> 04:58.631
Copy.
We're in position.

05:00.801 --> 05:03.261
They're trying to get
outside the blast radius.

05:03.345 --> 05:04.930
<i>The truck is on its own now.</i>

05:05.931 --> 05:07.057
Okay, guys?

05:52.185 --> 05:54.021
Sir, I could use your help up here.

05:54.855 --> 05:57.107
<i>This is Wilson.</i>
<i>The road ahead was supposed to be clear.</i>

05:57.190 --> 05:58.733
I'm jamming his radio.

05:59.651 --> 06:01.111
Does anybody copy?

06:02.737 --> 06:04.822
Lady, you do not want to be here!

06:11.246 --> 06:12.539
I said, you do not--

06:17.044 --> 06:18.253
Okay, he's out!

06:40.900 --> 06:42.027
Transfer complete.

06:42.860 --> 06:44.196
Pick it up, guys.

06:59.252 --> 07:01.046
Charge is set.

07:04.174 --> 07:05.217
Okay.

07:51.221 --> 07:52.973
We're good for roughly 40 hours.

07:53.056 --> 07:55.517
Well, that went about as well
as I could have hoped.

07:55.600 --> 07:57.477
Yeah.

07:58.936 --> 08:00.022
There it is.

08:00.105 --> 08:02.524
We've just officially changed history.

08:02.607 --> 08:04.859
We just saved 11,000 people.

08:04.942 --> 08:07.779
Except for the guy
who was driving that truck.

08:07.862 --> 08:10.240
One piece of history
that we couldn't change.

08:10.323 --> 08:12.450
At 0830 tomorrow... today,

08:12.534 --> 08:15.287
we'll hand off the antimatter
to the arriving team leader,

08:15.370 --> 08:18.081
-and our first mission will be complete.
-Yeah. Philip and I can handle that.

08:18.165 --> 08:19.166
Why?

08:19.249 --> 08:23.211
Well, Trevor's got school,
and Carly's got a baby,

08:23.295 --> 08:26.339
and you've got a wife you got to go
home to and meet for the first time, so...

08:26.423 --> 08:29.967
Right, my wife of 11 years.

08:30.760 --> 08:33.471
Okay. You two do the hand-off.
We'll meet later on.

08:33.555 --> 08:35.598
I'll get you home.
Great work, everybody.

09:01.958 --> 09:03.960
Hi.

09:04.711 --> 09:06.754
Did you have anything to do
with the blackout?

09:08.215 --> 09:09.257
No.

09:12.677 --> 09:17.349
Then... did you have anything
to do with the FBI?

09:19.476 --> 09:21.894
An agent called.
He said he stopped by earlier.

09:23.771 --> 09:26.233
You know,
I don't get a lot of FBI agents calling.

09:27.359 --> 09:29.902
-Was his name MacLaren?
-Yes.

09:31.279 --> 09:34.324
Well, would it help you
if I told you I work with him?

09:35.325 --> 09:37.744
Yeah, it would.
It would help a lot.

09:37.827 --> 09:39.662
It'd make a lot of sense, actually.

09:41.248 --> 09:42.374
Okay.

09:46.043 --> 09:48.421
And it's all good, this FBI business?

09:49.297 --> 09:50.882
Yeah, it's all fine.

09:54.177 --> 09:55.178
Okay.

09:56.096 --> 09:57.347
Well, it's late.

10:03.478 --> 10:04.937
One more question.

10:07.357 --> 10:08.858
Why are you here?

10:11.944 --> 10:14.239
Staying in my apartment...

10:15.157 --> 10:16.366
with me?

10:19.577 --> 10:23.123
David, there's gonna come a time
where I'll need your help.

10:24.499 --> 10:25.542
My help?

10:25.625 --> 10:26.751
Mmm-hmm.

10:27.669 --> 10:31.298
I mean, honestly, there's...
there's not that many people I can trust.

10:33.133 --> 10:34.592
But if it's... if it's not okay--

10:34.676 --> 10:35.843
No. Uh...

10:36.761 --> 10:37.804
It's fine.

10:53.027 --> 10:54.904
I wish you could come in.

10:55.822 --> 10:58.158
There's a babysitter.

10:59.742 --> 11:02.370
Well, I guess we'll
just have to wait until--

11:11.254 --> 11:13.298
Yep.
That's you, all right.

11:36.363 --> 11:37.364
Hello?

11:43.828 --> 11:44.871
Hello?

15:33.224 --> 15:35.643
Couldn't even make it upstairs, huh?

15:37.520 --> 15:40.607
Oh. Uh, no, I didn't want to wake you.

15:41.524 --> 15:42.775
Tough night?

15:43.693 --> 15:45.820
Uh... a long night.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.081
There you go.

15:57.999 --> 15:59.125
Thanks.

16:01.418 --> 16:03.087
Oh, no.
Is the milk off?

16:03.170 --> 16:05.548
You know, the power
was out almost all night.

16:05.632 --> 16:07.174
I am going to the fabric store
later today.

16:07.258 --> 16:09.385
Do you want me to pick up
that linen for your mother?

16:09.469 --> 16:10.595
My mother?

16:11.763 --> 16:13.305
That milk is fine.

16:13.389 --> 16:14.557
This is cow's milk.

16:14.641 --> 16:16.934
What animal were you expecting?

16:17.018 --> 16:19.103
You know, I don't know if we're
gonna be seeing them this weekend,

16:19.186 --> 16:20.772
but I can still pick it up.

16:21.689 --> 16:24.108
Yeah, sure.
That's great, Kathryn.

16:24.191 --> 16:25.192
Kathryn?

16:28.362 --> 16:29.739
What?

16:29.822 --> 16:32.575
You haven't called me
by my full name since our first date.

16:32.659 --> 16:34.911
Yeah.
What's that about?

16:34.994 --> 16:37.038
You need to take a nap.

16:37.121 --> 16:39.248
You're not safe to drive
when you're this tired.

16:39.331 --> 16:40.416
Hmm.

16:40.500 --> 16:41.959
I gotta go...

16:42.043 --> 16:44.378
'cause I've got that big meeting today.

16:45.713 --> 16:46.881
Good luck.

16:46.964 --> 16:48.132
Thank you.

16:50.927 --> 16:52.428
Have a great day...

16:53.846 --> 16:55.557
-Kat.
-Take a nap!

16:55.640 --> 16:56.808
Uh-huh.

17:22.291 --> 17:24.168
Trevor! Get up!

17:24.251 --> 17:26.378
-I'm up! I'm up! I'm up! I'm up!
-Up!

17:27.004 --> 17:28.548
I'm up, okay?

17:29.716 --> 17:31.300
Breakfast is on the table.

18:02.748 --> 18:05.710
<i>Hey, it's Marcy.</i>
<i>I'll meet you at the T.E.L.L.</i>

18:22.226 --> 18:24.520
Oh. Hey, Marcy, don't sneak out on me.

18:25.437 --> 18:28.775
I've been thinking, and I want you
to come to the hospital with me.

18:28.858 --> 18:29.901
No.

18:30.985 --> 18:31.986
No?

18:32.904 --> 18:35.782
You can't pretend that you didn't have
a seizure two days ago.

18:35.865 --> 18:38.826
I mean, whatever else is going on,
that was real.

18:39.744 --> 18:40.953
And it wasn't a little thing.

18:41.037 --> 18:43.205
I'm not gonna pretend
that it didn't happen.

18:43.289 --> 18:44.874
You need to see a doctor.

18:46.626 --> 18:48.169
I am a doctor.

18:48.753 --> 18:50.212
What?

18:51.338 --> 18:53.007
Wanna know what a doctor would say?

18:53.090 --> 18:56.052
That I had something
like an absence seizure.

18:56.135 --> 18:59.722
That the electrical signals in my brain
repeated themselves over and over

18:59.806 --> 19:01.473
in a three-second pattern.

19:01.557 --> 19:04.101
She'll be confused, because it's
more common in children than adults.

19:04.185 --> 19:07.146
And then she'll order an MRI,
because it's likely to get worse.

19:07.897 --> 19:10.232
-Why didn't you just say that?
-Because...

19:11.275 --> 19:14.028
There... there's just
so much more to this.

19:14.111 --> 19:15.446
Then give me a hint.

19:16.572 --> 19:18.032
Give me something.

19:18.950 --> 19:20.785
I mean, technically,
I... I'm still your social worker.

19:20.868 --> 19:23.537
-I can make you go to the hospital.
-Okay, what's the date today?

19:23.620 --> 19:24.621
The 13th?

19:25.539 --> 19:27.208
There will be a small commuter plane crash

19:27.291 --> 19:30.962
in Oregon around noon,
with, uh, four casualties.

19:31.045 --> 19:35.299
If that doesn't happen, I will go
to the hospital with you, okay? Fair?

19:36.217 --> 19:38.510
That's ridiculous.
I mean, nobody can predict that.

19:38.594 --> 19:42.056
Well, then you'll get what you want,
and I will go to the doctor with you.

19:42.139 --> 19:43.140
Do we have a deal?

19:44.100 --> 19:46.352
No. I also want your cell number.

19:46.435 --> 19:47.729
I don't have one.

19:47.812 --> 19:49.063
You don't have a cell?

19:49.981 --> 19:51.774
Fine, yours is a secret.

19:58.405 --> 19:59.531
Here, take this.

19:59.615 --> 20:02.118
I bought it as a gift
for somebody that I used to...

20:02.201 --> 20:04.370
You know, it doesn't matter.
Take it.

20:04.453 --> 20:06.455
If it rings, it's me.
Please answer.

21:53.479 --> 21:55.064
Welcome to the 21st.

21:55.147 --> 21:57.024
I'm Traveler 3569.

22:06.117 --> 22:07.368
Oh, shit.

22:24.426 --> 22:26.303
-What do you think, boss?
-Of what?

22:26.387 --> 22:28.222
Our operations base?

22:28.305 --> 22:31.017
Yeah, it's breathtaking.
You're sure there hasn't been a messenger?

22:31.100 --> 22:33.560
I think a pre-adolescent kid
might stand out.

22:33.644 --> 22:35.771
I thought this was gonna be
a simple hand-off.

22:35.854 --> 22:38.357
The director probably
didn't know about the pills.

22:38.440 --> 22:39.525
What pills?

22:39.608 --> 22:40.692
A fatal dose of fentanyl.

22:40.776 --> 22:43.404
Probably a failsafe in case he lacked
the courage to pull the trigger.

22:43.487 --> 22:45.114
The director missed it.

22:45.197 --> 22:47.950
Cause of death on historical record
is gunshot to the head.

22:48.034 --> 22:50.161
And there wasn't anyone
from his team there to meet him?

22:50.244 --> 22:51.453
No. And we looked around.

22:51.537 --> 22:52.872
Let's not panic.
The director will be aware

22:52.955 --> 22:54.957
that a traveler didn't make it
and assign a new candidate.

22:55.041 --> 22:57.418
Yeah, if one comes available in time.

22:57.501 --> 22:59.461
You've memorized
all the potential candidates in the area?

22:59.545 --> 23:01.130
I've memorized everything.

23:01.213 --> 23:04.216
Okay. Show off a little.
How many since 0830?

23:06.635 --> 23:08.595
Hmm.
Today's not a real good day.

23:09.555 --> 23:12.099
There's a construction worker
that gets electrocuted early this morning.

23:12.183 --> 23:13.809
Prime host, actually.

23:13.892 --> 23:16.770
But the accident's impossible
for the incoming traveler to avoid, so...

23:16.853 --> 23:19.856
Report of the construction worker's
death this morning is already online.

23:19.941 --> 23:22.276
In a couple hours,
there's an elective surgery that goes bad.

23:22.359 --> 23:25.112
The point is, it could take time.
How much do we have?

23:25.196 --> 23:27.239
Thirty hours, give or take.

23:27.323 --> 23:28.907
We should drive the antimatter
out of town,

23:28.991 --> 23:30.534
like the military was trying to do.

23:30.617 --> 23:33.037
No. No, the director must have
some sort of plan for it.

23:33.120 --> 23:34.955
Probably as a power source.

23:35.039 --> 23:37.499
We need to make it possible
for the other team to find us.

23:37.583 --> 23:40.294
I could throw out something
like an SOS on the Deep Web.

23:40.377 --> 23:42.254
That would risk exposure from the FBI.

23:42.338 --> 23:44.966
-You know all about that.
-Try your SOS.

23:45.049 --> 23:47.551
I can run interference at the bureau
if I have to.

23:47.634 --> 23:50.221
And we could look at a way
to extend the life of the unit

23:50.304 --> 23:52.014
with a supplemental power supply.

23:52.098 --> 23:53.515
Buy some time.

23:54.058 --> 23:55.101
Good.

23:55.184 --> 23:58.354
I'm gonna talk to the traveler
that delivered it to us last night.

23:58.437 --> 24:00.106
You sure that's a good idea?

24:00.689 --> 24:01.690
No.

24:07.363 --> 24:08.405
Delaney.

24:08.489 --> 24:11.575
<i>This is Major Gleason.</i>
<i>I guess you've been expecting my call.</i>

24:11.658 --> 24:13.619
Actually, I was hoping
never to hear from you again.

24:13.702 --> 24:14.703
How's the circle jerk going?

24:14.786 --> 24:17.456
-We never had the material, did we?
<i>-What are you talking about?</i>

24:17.539 --> 24:19.083
You're the one
who drove away with it last night.

24:19.166 --> 24:20.292
<i>Yeah, well, I thought so, too.</i>

24:20.376 --> 24:22.378
Why aren't you off on an island
somewhere exploding bombs?

24:22.461 --> 24:25.381
<i>Well, there was an explosion,</i>
<i>just not the one we were expecting.</i>

24:25.464 --> 24:26.923
Oh, God.

24:27.008 --> 24:28.050
When?

24:28.133 --> 24:29.218
On our way to the base.

24:29.301 --> 24:30.761
How many casualties?

24:30.844 --> 24:33.889
The blast was substantial enough
to put my driver into a coma,

24:33.972 --> 24:35.724
but we both know
it should have been in the megaton range.

24:35.807 --> 24:38.685
<i>-This didn't even make the news.</i>
-I'm not sure what you're accusing me of--

24:38.769 --> 24:40.312
It never existed,
or somehow you hung on to it.

24:40.396 --> 24:43.357
Either way,
we are going to have a conversation.

24:46.152 --> 24:49.113
-I'm just down here. See you later.
-See you later.

24:49.196 --> 24:51.032
- Bye, sweetie.
- Call me later.

24:51.115 --> 24:52.783
Bye.
See you guys soon.

24:52.866 --> 24:54.035
Hey.

24:54.118 --> 24:56.037
Protocol 6, Agent MacLaren.

24:56.120 --> 24:58.205
Can't Officer Boyd and Special Agent
MacLaren have a conversation?

24:58.289 --> 25:01.542
Okay, well, first of all, don't refer
to yourself in the third person.

25:01.625 --> 25:03.127
Is this FBI business?

25:03.210 --> 25:05.629
In the sense that they wouldn't want
an antimatter explosion

25:05.712 --> 25:07.464
in the middle of town.

25:07.548 --> 25:09.466
Are you serious?

25:09.550 --> 25:10.676
Have you been sent a messenger?

25:10.759 --> 25:12.553
Are you authorized by the director
to talk to me?

25:12.636 --> 25:13.970
Then step away.

25:14.055 --> 25:17.558
Well, look, the arriving traveler
we were meeting was DOA.

25:17.641 --> 25:19.226
In the absence
of a clear course of action,

25:19.310 --> 25:22.146
you await instruction from the director
via messenger or traveler.

25:22.229 --> 25:23.397
What else do you want me to tell you?

25:23.480 --> 25:26.733
How about the location of the team
that we were supposed to hand off to?

25:26.817 --> 25:29.736
I don't know,
and I'm not supposed to know.

25:29.820 --> 25:32.239
Look, you're new.
I get it. I really do.

25:32.323 --> 25:33.907
And you got a bitch of a first assignment.

25:34.825 --> 25:37.703
But I've been here a year,
and shit happens, okay?

25:37.786 --> 25:40.289
There's a reason we're
so compartmentalized, MacLaren.

25:40.372 --> 25:42.583
There's teams of us all over the world
on missions, and that's why--

25:42.666 --> 25:44.293
-That is why there's a Protocol 6.
-Yeah.

25:44.376 --> 25:46.587
Yeah, I get the rules,
but... but help me out here.

25:46.670 --> 25:48.755
Should we drive it
to an unpopulated area,

25:48.839 --> 25:52.050
or leave it where it is
and risk wiping out a city?

25:52.134 --> 25:53.677
It's a tough call.

25:53.760 --> 25:55.221
Get it right, please.

26:01.143 --> 26:02.519
<i>Aviation authorities agree</i>

26:02.603 --> 26:06.815
<i>if it were not for the skill of the pilot,</i>
<i>this tragedy could have been much worse.</i>

26:06.898 --> 26:09.568
<i>With just four dead,</i>
<i>local authorities are grateful</i>

26:09.651 --> 26:13.489
<i>the pilot managed to bring</i>
<i>the commuter plane down in a remote area.</i>

26:14.323 --> 26:16.450
<i>Names of the dead</i>
<i>have not yet been released</i>

26:16.533 --> 26:18.785
<i>pending notification of the families...</i>

26:30.881 --> 26:32.549
You all right?

26:32.633 --> 26:33.925
You're sweating.

26:34.009 --> 26:36.470
I'd like it if there was no bomb
in my house, but otherwise...

26:36.553 --> 26:37.596
Philip.

26:38.639 --> 26:41.308
I think we are ready to do this.

26:44.102 --> 26:45.354
You got a cell phone?

26:45.437 --> 26:48.064
-Yeah.
-Who could be calling you?

26:48.982 --> 26:51.235
It is my social worker.

26:53.195 --> 26:54.238
Yes?

26:54.863 --> 26:57.949
How could you have possibly,
possibly known that was gonna happen

26:58.033 --> 26:59.951
unless you had something
to do with it happening?

27:00.035 --> 27:01.745
<i>I can't tell you that.</i>

27:01.828 --> 27:03.497
Marcy, this is crazy.

27:04.373 --> 27:05.666
We made a deal that if it happened,

27:05.749 --> 27:07.876
I wouldn't have to go
to the hospital with you today.

27:07.959 --> 27:09.670
Yes...
but I didn't expect this.

27:09.753 --> 27:10.879
<i>Yeah, well, it happened.</i>

27:10.962 --> 27:13.465
You asked for a hint, I gave you one.

27:13.549 --> 27:16.134
-Look, I really need to go.
<i>-No, wait. Just one more question.</i>

27:17.135 --> 27:20.597
This FBI business?
Is it dangerous?

27:22.308 --> 27:24.851
Well, that depends on--

27:26.437 --> 27:27.854
Marcy, what's happening?

27:29.398 --> 27:32.318
-What happened?
-His... his hands just started shaking.

27:32.401 --> 27:34.069
I think he shorted out the circuit.

27:35.446 --> 27:37.113
- <i>He's in cardiac arrest.</i>
- Marcy...

27:37.198 --> 27:38.324
<i>Go grab my bag.</i>

27:40.576 --> 27:41.743
Marcy?

27:45.289 --> 27:46.457
Marcy?

27:46.540 --> 27:48.166
<i>Come on.</i>

27:48.250 --> 27:50.336
<i>Philip... stay with us.</i>

27:50.419 --> 27:51.628
<i>Marcy?</i>

27:51.712 --> 27:53.422
- Come on.
<i>- Marcy?</i>

27:56.800 --> 27:58.844
Come on...

28:00.679 --> 28:01.805
Come on.

28:12.983 --> 28:14.735
He's back.

28:18.154 --> 28:19.406
Speak up, Trevor.

28:22.993 --> 28:25.036
Well, we didn't add time.

28:27.373 --> 28:29.583
We lost it, and there's not much left.

28:39.218 --> 28:40.427
I don't know what happened.

28:40.511 --> 28:43.179
It was like a tremor.
My hand just jumped from the connectors.

28:43.264 --> 28:46.892
Shorting out our supplemental power supply
and draining the unit's capacitor.

28:47.976 --> 28:50.186
- I am so sorry, guys.
- Can you start over?

28:51.730 --> 28:53.064
Not in the few hours we have.

28:54.525 --> 28:55.776
What did you get out of Boyd?

28:56.568 --> 28:58.904
Only that I was in gross violation
of Protocol 6,

28:58.987 --> 29:00.656
and we should solve our own problems.

29:00.739 --> 29:03.950
I think the solution now is to get
that thing at a safe distance.

29:04.034 --> 29:05.952
Carly, if that's what
the director wanted us to do,

29:06.036 --> 29:08.121
wouldn't he have sent a messenger by now
telling us to do it?

29:08.205 --> 29:10.540
Which means there's another solution
we haven't thought of.

29:10.624 --> 29:12.876
Yeah, one that we will
think of in the next five hours.

29:12.960 --> 29:13.961
If we're down to hours,

29:14.044 --> 29:17.213
then there's no safe place
for the antimatter other than far away.

29:20.509 --> 29:21.718
Yes, there is.

29:23.178 --> 29:24.430
And it's obvious.

29:25.347 --> 29:26.890
Where it was created.

29:27.808 --> 29:29.518
Delaney's lab?

29:29.601 --> 29:31.687
- That's insane.
- Is it?

29:31.770 --> 29:34.356
I mean, the whole facility
was designed to store antimatter

29:34.440 --> 29:36.191
for an unlimited amount of time.

29:36.275 --> 29:38.735
And it's a half hour away in traffic.

29:38.819 --> 29:40.946
I'm sure the team we were
supposed to hand this off to

29:41.029 --> 29:42.698
must have had other plans.

29:42.781 --> 29:45.534
Well, no plan survives
contact with the past.

29:46.452 --> 29:49.538
Can you find us a map of the
Van Huizen compound on this antique?

29:49.621 --> 29:51.206
Okay, one,

29:51.290 --> 29:53.375
this equipment
is currently state of the art.

29:53.459 --> 29:55.085
And two,

29:55.168 --> 29:57.379
wouldn't you rather I just hack
into their main computer system?

29:57.463 --> 29:58.464
Oh.

29:59.381 --> 30:00.382
Yes, please.

30:01.758 --> 30:04.345
Okay, I don't want to shoot a hole
in our only idea here, but--

30:04.428 --> 30:06.347
How do we do this
without Delaney knowing we did it?

30:06.430 --> 30:08.264
I'm already in violation
of Protocol 6 today.

30:08.349 --> 30:09.891
-Maybe I should just tell her.
-Oh, no.

30:09.975 --> 30:11.393
What is it?

30:11.477 --> 30:14.355
The school called my mom.
I missed a science test yesterday.

30:14.438 --> 30:16.106
I'm in.

30:20.444 --> 30:22.112
I could shut down the security system.

30:22.904 --> 30:24.573
I can probably shut down their power.

30:25.407 --> 30:27.701
But what might be most useful is a flood

30:28.369 --> 30:30.954
in the high-pressure water coolant supply
of building 26.

30:31.037 --> 30:32.205
What do you think?

30:46.887 --> 30:48.472
For fuck's sake.

31:04.780 --> 31:06.532
Okay.
See you, Jason.

31:14.665 --> 31:17.125
-Your friend is determined.
-Yeah.

31:19.210 --> 31:21.922
There.
He gave up.

31:24.007 --> 31:26.968
What exactly does a librarian
need with a social worker?

31:29.012 --> 31:32.140
My host's identity was fiction.

31:32.223 --> 31:36.645
The product of a character-building
exercise in social media,

31:36.728 --> 31:40.607
and which, in her case,
was our primary source of information.

31:40.691 --> 31:42.734
In reality, Marcy...

31:44.027 --> 31:47.363
is a mentally-challenged woman
living in the care of the state.

31:47.448 --> 31:49.115
How is that not a giant problem?

31:50.492 --> 31:53.704
Long term, it's most certainly fatal.

31:53.787 --> 31:56.707
I mean, not today or the next day.

31:56.790 --> 31:59.501
I plan on telling MacLaren
once I've properly diagnosed myself.

31:59.585 --> 32:03.171
I just need somebody to know
in case I have another seizure.

32:07.676 --> 32:08.927
We all have our burdens.

32:09.845 --> 32:10.929
Yours is no easier.

32:15.350 --> 32:16.351
I'm a doctor.

32:17.268 --> 32:18.437
I know the symptoms.

32:21.272 --> 32:22.566
-I'm dealing with it.
-Hmm.

32:22.649 --> 32:24.568
Well, I want you to dose before we go.

32:25.736 --> 32:27.696
To keep your hands from shaking.

32:28.739 --> 32:30.657
Today is not the day you want to quit.

32:46.673 --> 32:50.343
You know, I'm not crazy about the idea
of getting in bed with a mass murderer.

32:50.426 --> 32:53.221
Who? Delaney? You're forgetting
we changed history. It never happened.

32:53.304 --> 32:56.141
She still created the most
destructive weapon in history.

32:57.225 --> 32:58.935
If the military hadn't taken it
farther away--

32:59.019 --> 33:01.437
That's their horseshit story.
Delaney was a scapegoat.

33:01.522 --> 33:03.189
It was their own containment unit
that failed.

33:03.273 --> 33:05.400
History just bought
into their version of the story.

33:05.484 --> 33:08.028
I've seen her in those old history docs.

33:09.070 --> 33:11.364
The woman's got all the charm
of a foaming yeast vat.

33:18.789 --> 33:20.415
Turn left up here.

33:29.633 --> 33:31.426
Hey. How's your day going so far?

33:31.510 --> 33:35.514
We've got, uh, something
about flooding in building 26.

33:35.597 --> 33:37.808
-IDs please?
-Sure.

33:49.402 --> 33:52.489
Fourteen gallons of water per minute.
Tick tock.

33:57.243 --> 33:58.453
Go ahead.

34:08.421 --> 34:10.506
Afternoon, sir. I'm with FTRA.

34:10.591 --> 34:12.258
-Go ahead.
-Okay, then.

34:20.225 --> 34:22.352
Okay, guys, I've hacked
into the security systems.

34:22.435 --> 34:23.812
No workers where we want to be.

34:23.895 --> 34:26.690
All right, keep your eyes
and your coms open.

34:46.668 --> 34:47.669
Come on.

35:01.391 --> 35:03.184
It looks like the interface
is up top.

35:03.268 --> 35:04.936
You stay right where you are.

35:13.612 --> 35:15.697
Shit.

35:21.452 --> 35:23.538
South door. Go.

35:35.008 --> 35:37.678
I already shut off the relief
valve that had been opened remotely,

35:37.761 --> 35:39.846
so you don't need to bother
going through the motions.

35:42.515 --> 35:45.936
So... Major Dickless
didn't have the balls to do this himself?

35:46.019 --> 35:50.106
If you mean Major Gleason,
who took your antimatter last night, no.

35:50.190 --> 35:52.442
In fact, we're the ones
who took it from him.

35:52.525 --> 35:55.111
The material's in that black bag
on my associate's shoulder.

35:55.195 --> 35:58.657
In a bag that size?
No.

35:58.740 --> 35:59.991
It is pretty heavy.

36:00.075 --> 36:02.703
My other associate has a 9mm
aimed at your back.

36:02.786 --> 36:05.288
Marcy, would you just aim
the laser guide of your weapon

36:05.371 --> 36:07.248
at me for a second?

36:09.042 --> 36:10.210
We stopped a disaster last night,

36:10.293 --> 36:11.419
and to prevent another one,

36:11.502 --> 36:13.880
we need to get this material
back where it belongs.

36:13.964 --> 36:15.631
Who the fuck are you people?

36:15.716 --> 36:17.926
My name is MacLaren.
I'm with the FBI.

36:18.009 --> 36:20.136
My team has been tasked
at the highest level

36:20.220 --> 36:21.805
to prevent the military from building

36:21.888 --> 36:23.807
the most powerful weapon
of mass destruction in history.

36:23.890 --> 36:25.516
The teenager is FBI?

36:25.600 --> 36:28.144
Just me.
They're specialists.

36:28.228 --> 36:29.855
Show me your credentials.

36:31.147 --> 36:33.900
We prevented the deaths
of thousands of people last night,

36:33.984 --> 36:35.568
not to mention an arms race.

36:35.651 --> 36:39.447
But our portable containment unit
has a limited battery capacity.

36:39.530 --> 36:40.615
Show it to me.

36:40.699 --> 36:42.075
Yeah.

36:55.380 --> 36:57.132
Is it supposed to be flashing like that?

36:57.215 --> 36:59.675
We don't have much time.
We need to transfer it now.

36:59.760 --> 37:01.803
How could you possibly create
a stable magnetic bottle

37:01.887 --> 37:03.263
inside something so small?

37:04.180 --> 37:05.223
<i>Somebody's here.</i>

37:06.808 --> 37:09.352
It's one vehicle,
and the driver's alone.

37:09.435 --> 37:11.604
- Military.
<i>- Copy. Take no action.</i>

37:11.687 --> 37:13.439
A vehicle's just pulled up outside.

37:13.523 --> 37:15.901
It's Gleason. I thought he sent
you people to steal my research.

37:15.984 --> 37:17.068
How much time do we have?

37:17.152 --> 37:19.279
It's not like there's a clock
on the thing.

37:19.362 --> 37:21.990
Minutes. There won't be a warning.
It'll just go boom.

37:22.073 --> 37:24.242
You need to get rid of him
as quickly as possible.

37:24.325 --> 37:25.576
That's all I ever do with him.

37:25.660 --> 37:26.828
Come on.

37:41.009 --> 37:42.385
Where's your staff?

37:42.468 --> 37:44.387
We had a small coolant leak.

37:44.470 --> 37:46.389
I sent everyone home
while these people clean up.

37:47.640 --> 37:49.642
Can you guys be somewhere else
for a few minutes?

37:50.560 --> 37:52.478
You're fine.
Go back to work.

37:54.272 --> 37:55.648
They don't give a shit
what we have to say,

37:55.731 --> 37:57.776
and frankly, I'm a little afraid
to be alone with you.

37:57.859 --> 37:59.610
That's funny,
I feel the same way.

37:59.694 --> 38:02.447
Go see for yourself that it's not here,
so you can leave.

38:07.493 --> 38:08.829
We don't have time for this.

38:08.912 --> 38:10.288
Not yet.

38:12.582 --> 38:14.876
All right. So...

38:16.294 --> 38:18.797
if I never had it, and it's not here,
then the only other possibility--

38:25.011 --> 38:26.346
What is that sound?

38:31.267 --> 38:32.143
I lied.

38:36.356 --> 38:38.024
It never existed.

38:39.275 --> 38:40.861
Material seemed to be accumulating,

38:40.944 --> 38:42.737
but with each new anti-particle
we created,

38:42.821 --> 38:44.823
there were quantum micro-annihilations
that went unrecorded.

38:44.906 --> 38:46.324
We have to take him out.

38:46.407 --> 38:47.492
I said wait.

38:47.575 --> 38:48.618
I didn't want
to lose our funding,

38:48.701 --> 38:50.871
and thought we were
making progress, but at best...

38:50.954 --> 38:52.080
We don't have time for this.

38:52.163 --> 38:53.456
...you drove off with a milligram.

38:53.539 --> 38:55.750
I know how hard
that must have been for you to confess.

38:55.834 --> 38:58.294
And on that level,
I must admit I enjoyed that a little.

38:59.254 --> 39:02.673
But I do believe you were close,
and we want you to continue your work.

39:04.175 --> 39:06.677
But that means you
won't be rid of me for a while.

39:06.761 --> 39:08.221
Can I at least be rid of you now?

39:11.141 --> 39:12.267
Of course.

39:22.568 --> 39:24.362
Major Dickless is leaving.

39:40.753 --> 39:43.173
Is the containment unit
powered up to 120 MeV?

39:43.256 --> 39:46.384
We left it fully charged
in case the transfer wasn't 100%.

39:46.467 --> 39:49.595
- How long is this going to take?
- I don't know.

40:00.398 --> 40:02.150
Done. It's back.

40:02.233 --> 40:03.276
Huh.

40:04.194 --> 40:05.904
Kinda thought that'd be a bigger deal.

40:05.987 --> 40:07.948
Nope.

40:09.699 --> 40:11.075
Empty.

40:11.159 --> 40:13.912
10.3 grams of antimatter.
Perfectly stable.

40:15.580 --> 40:17.123
How close did we come?

40:17.207 --> 40:19.042
I already told you,
there's no way of knowing.

40:21.461 --> 40:23.046
It was pretty close, though.

40:28.093 --> 40:30.428
Doctor,
I can't emphasize enough how important--

40:30.511 --> 40:31.679
FBI, my ass.

40:33.514 --> 40:35.350
Who are you people?

40:35.433 --> 40:37.560
Blondie over there
can't be much over 20,

40:37.644 --> 40:41.356
and the technology Beefcake carried in
on his shoulder doesn't exist.

40:41.439 --> 40:42.815
Well, obviously, it does.

40:43.566 --> 40:45.026
Look, all you need to know
at this point

40:45.110 --> 40:47.362
is that I am with the bureau,
the task force is top secret,

40:47.445 --> 40:49.114
and this won't be the last
you hear from us.

40:49.197 --> 40:50.823
Just keep the material safe for now.

40:50.906 --> 40:53.576
For now?
What does that mean?

40:53.659 --> 40:56.955
As in out of the hands of the military
and off the front page of the paper.

40:57.038 --> 40:58.039
Look...

40:58.957 --> 41:03.086
if you need to reach me,
or you want our help, there's my number.

41:04.004 --> 41:05.671
But I'll probably be calling you first.

41:06.589 --> 41:07.798
I'll hold my breath.

41:08.716 --> 41:09.717
By the way...

41:09.800 --> 41:12.137
we were this close to intervening.

41:12.220 --> 41:13.346
You just saved his life.

41:13.429 --> 41:14.722
Who? Gleason?

41:16.057 --> 41:18.684
Oh, great.
That makes my day.

41:55.763 --> 41:57.390
Did you get my text?

41:58.308 --> 42:00.143
Yeah. Sorry, uh...

42:01.061 --> 42:02.270
I got busy.

42:03.729 --> 42:06.566
Well, the doctors did say
you'd get back to your old self.

42:24.542 --> 42:26.586
Just making some tea.
Do you want some?

42:26.669 --> 42:27.878
Please.

42:31.299 --> 42:32.425
So...

42:34.052 --> 42:35.428
did you save him?

42:36.887 --> 42:38.056
Hmm?

42:39.432 --> 42:41.851
I only ask because I heard you
administering CPR

42:41.934 --> 42:44.354
to someone named Philip,

42:44.437 --> 42:46.939
who apparently had cardiac arrest,

42:47.022 --> 42:48.441
uh, before the phone went dead,

42:48.524 --> 42:51.819
and then, uh, you didn't answer
for the rest of the day.

42:55.198 --> 42:56.866
Yeah, he's... he's fine.

42:56.949 --> 42:58.243
Oh, good.

42:59.660 --> 43:00.786
Good.

43:04.874 --> 43:07.377
So, what's on the agenda
for tomorrow?

43:07.460 --> 43:10.838
Uh... I was thinking about what you said,

43:10.921 --> 43:13.383
and tomorrow I'm gonna go to the hospital.

43:16.427 --> 43:19.597
Do you want me to take you, or...

43:21.057 --> 43:23.893
do you wanna rappel down a rope
from a helicopter?

43:26.687 --> 43:28.731
No, I would like you to take me.

43:29.649 --> 43:30.983
Please.

43:36.156 --> 43:37.532
Hi.

43:37.615 --> 43:39.617
Sorry I'm late.

43:39.700 --> 43:40.701
Okay.

43:42.036 --> 43:43.163
Oh, thank you.

43:44.080 --> 43:46.916
I'll see you tomorrow. Okay.

43:46.999 --> 43:48.668
I know. I know. I know.

43:52.630 --> 43:53.756
Okay.

44:07.187 --> 44:08.563
I'm home.

44:08.646 --> 44:09.980
What?

44:10.064 --> 44:13.193
My husband actually home
for the evening? No...

44:13.276 --> 44:15.320
-Hi!
-Hi.

44:17.197 --> 44:18.198
Hi.

44:18.281 --> 44:21.159
What are you...
This is a nice surprise.

44:21.242 --> 44:22.410
Mmm.

44:22.493 --> 44:24.245
Oh.

44:25.163 --> 44:27.707
You get that.
I'll go pour us a glass of wine.

44:32.295 --> 44:35.130
- Hello.
- Traveler 3468.

44:35.215 --> 44:38.926
Mission outcome acceptable
in light of extenuating factors.

44:39.009 --> 44:42.096
Further breach of protocols
may result in punitive action.

44:43.013 --> 44:44.182
End of message.

44:47.352 --> 44:48.353
Who are you?

44:48.436 --> 44:51.981
I'm the guy you're gonna
sell those cookies to, I think.

44:53.274 --> 44:56.319
Sweetheart, I bought two boxes
from you half an hour ago.

44:56.402 --> 44:57.903
You've already done
this side of the street.

45:00.406 --> 45:02.199
Okay, bye.

45:07.955 --> 45:11.041
Both of which you're gonna take
to the office with you tomorrow.

45:11.125 --> 45:13.127
If they stay in this house,
I'll eat 'em all.

45:13.210 --> 45:14.670
If you insist.

45:15.588 --> 45:17.965
So... how was your day?

45:19.509 --> 45:21.218
You know what?

45:21.302 --> 45:24.555
My day was boring.
I'd rather hear about yours.

45:26.307 --> 45:27.850
Tell me everything.
