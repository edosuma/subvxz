WEBVTT

00:03.170 --> 00:05.339
Ms. Dewitt, please.

00:05.339 --> 00:07.341
Just stay a little longer.

00:08.759 --> 00:12.179
Look, the scouts are coming
to see Travis play,

00:12.179 --> 00:14.348
I'd hate to see him miss this opportunity.

00:14.348 --> 00:16.016
You're worried about your team's season?

00:16.016 --> 00:18.602
No! Of course not.

00:18.602 --> 00:21.897
Jess, you know me.

00:21.897 --> 00:24.859
This isn't about football,
it's about this town.

00:24.859 --> 00:26.402
It's worth fighting for.

00:27.528 --> 00:30.030
I watched you and your sisters
grow up here.

00:32.908 --> 00:34.702
You think this was an easy decision?

00:36.662 --> 00:39.039
I have two sons I have to think about.

00:40.624 --> 00:44.378
Look, I've been gathering evidence.

00:44.378 --> 00:46.297
Working to shut that fracking rig down.

00:46.297 --> 00:48.007
But there's no guarantee, is there?

00:48.007 --> 00:50.843
- No, there's no guarantee...
- And in the meantime...

00:59.393 --> 01:01.729
...how many more people end up sick?

01:40.601 --> 01:43.020
Look, I'm just saying that
it's not like you to blow off the gloat.

01:43.020 --> 01:45.105
I mean, you're the one who taught me
that seeing the mark defeated

01:45.105 --> 01:48.359
is the, um--what did you call it?

01:48.359 --> 01:49.443
Curtain call?

01:49.443 --> 01:52.363
Curtain call.
Sophie Devereaux missing a curtain call?

01:52.363 --> 01:54.281
Well, maybe I'm seeing things
differently now.

01:54.281 --> 01:55.366
How so?

01:56.158 --> 02:00.496
Well, before we met you,
you--you had a moment of clarity.

02:00.496 --> 02:01.956
When you looked back

02:01.956 --> 02:04.083
and realized you didn't feel good
about some things you'd done.

02:04.083 --> 02:06.710
Oh, you mean helping the rich
and powerful do horrible things?

02:06.710 --> 02:08.295
I think I could've picked up
on that a little sooner.

02:08.295 --> 02:11.257
Well, maybe I'm having
a similar realization.

02:11.257 --> 02:14.510
You help people, I was hurting them,
that's not the same thing.

02:14.510 --> 02:16.178
I don't know.

02:16.178 --> 02:17.805
Sometimes I wonder

02:17.805 --> 02:20.808
if I haven't considered how what we do
affects other people.

02:21.809 --> 02:23.352
The people we don't think about.

02:23.352 --> 02:24.854
Collateral damage?

02:26.063 --> 02:28.357
Look, I know that this Arthur Wilde
character brought up

02:28.357 --> 02:33.320
a whole bunch of stuff for you,
but--but you are a good person, Sophie.

02:36.991 --> 02:38.075
 You getting it?

02:39.410 --> 02:41.662
Hmm, almost have it.

02:41.662 --> 02:42.830
Mm-hmm.

02:44.331 --> 02:46.917
- Oh, there!
<i>- Y'all got me?</i>

02:46.917 --> 02:48.544
Yeah, babe,
you're a little close to the camera.

02:48.544 --> 02:50.296
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I just wanna make sure y'all ready.</i>

02:50.296 --> 02:51.547
Ready for what?

02:51.547 --> 02:53.173
<i>-Ah.</i>
- Oh!

02:53.173 --> 02:54.550
<i>Look at this.</i>

02:54.550 --> 02:57.011
<i>Uh, I'm out here, I'm in orbit.</i>

02:57.011 --> 02:59.305
<i>I'm in a satellite, floating.</i>

02:59.305 --> 03:00.431
<i>-I'm weightless.</i>
- Wow.

03:00.431 --> 03:02.182
<i>Oh, wait, watch, watch.</i>

03:02.182 --> 03:03.767
<i>-Wait, oh.</i>
- Uh-oh.

03:03.767 --> 03:05.895
- Oh, no.
- <i>Okay. Okay.</i>

03:05.895 --> 03:07.313
- There you go, there you go.
- Use your core.

03:07.313 --> 03:08.230
Come on.

03:08.230 --> 03:10.107
<i>Wait. Oh. Oh. Wait.
There we go.</i>

03:10.107 --> 03:11.358
- Yeah!
- Hold it right there.

03:11.358 --> 03:12.985
Hold it right there, that's perfect.

03:12.985 --> 03:14.737
<i>Ah, it's just a little tight up in here</i>

03:14.737 --> 03:17.197
It's so cute.
It's like a vent with gadgets.

03:17.197 --> 03:19.992
I didn't think that satellites
had life support systems.

03:19.992 --> 03:21.911
<i>This one does now.</i>

03:21.911 --> 03:24.288
So that, that stuff that you had me build,
that's actually working?

03:24.288 --> 03:26.457
<i>Oh, yeah. I never had any doubt.</i>

03:26.457 --> 03:27.708
Hey.

03:27.708 --> 03:29.376
So how long do you have
to be up there for?

03:29.376 --> 03:32.046
<i>That solar flare did
some pretty real damage.</i>

03:32.046 --> 03:33.589
<i>I can get it fixed pretty quick,</i>

03:33.589 --> 03:35.507
<i>but I'll have to stay up here
a while to monitor it.</i>

03:35.507 --> 03:37.718
<i>It's not practical to come back up later.</i>

03:37.718 --> 03:39.303
<i>And besides, up here,</i>

03:39.303 --> 03:43.682
<i>I can get hacking access
unlike anything on Earth.</i>

03:43.682 --> 03:46.352
Can you get high-tech
banking schematics up there?

03:46.352 --> 03:48.771
<i>Babe, I--I can get that
down there, yeah. Yeah.</i>

03:48.771 --> 03:50.814
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's cooler up there.

03:50.814 --> 03:52.816
Everything's cooler in a satellite.

03:52.816 --> 03:54.193
<i>- Yes.</i>
- Hey.

03:54.193 --> 03:55.778
Dorks in Space.

03:55.778 --> 03:57.613
I've seen this movie.

03:57.613 --> 03:58.697
You going someplace?

03:59.615 --> 04:02.034
I'm gonna be off the grid
for a few days, so...

04:02.034 --> 04:03.243
Everything all right?

04:03.243 --> 04:04.328
Yeah.

04:04.328 --> 04:07.790
Just got some unfinished business
I need to attend to, so it's just...

04:07.790 --> 04:10.376
Is Eliot off to kill someone?

04:10.376 --> 04:11.919
Something I gotta do.

04:11.919 --> 04:14.546
<i>Uh, excuse y'all,
I'm calling from a satellite.</i>

04:14.546 --> 04:16.131
<i>Don't nobody wanna talk to me?</i>

04:16.131 --> 04:18.801
- Hey, hey, wait. Where are you going?
- What?

04:18.801 --> 04:20.469
Somewhere.

04:20.469 --> 04:23.973
You do know that Hardison's
on a spy satellite and we can track you

04:23.973 --> 04:26.058
anywhere, so maybe just tell us?

04:27.267 --> 04:28.519
I'm going to Oklahoma.

04:29.103 --> 04:30.437
What's in Oklahoma?

04:33.482 --> 04:34.858
What's in Oklahoma?

04:35.859 --> 04:37.027
<i>His father.</i>

04:38.404 --> 04:39.488
He has a father?

04:52.960 --> 04:57.131
<i>♪ Life goes on ♪</i>

04:57.131 --> 04:58.632
<i>♪ I'm a lone wolf, baby ♪</i>

04:58.632 --> 05:02.094
- Hey, Eliot!
- What the hell are you doing here?

05:02.094 --> 05:04.054
Sophie said I should come along
to give you something.

05:04.054 --> 05:06.015
- What?
- Emotional support.

05:06.015 --> 05:07.016
What the hell?

05:07.016 --> 05:08.475
Hardison wanted me to make sure

05:08.475 --> 05:10.060
she knew what emotional support was.

05:10.060 --> 05:12.104
What's this unfinished business
with your father?

05:13.731 --> 05:14.982
I gotta tell him something.

05:14.982 --> 05:16.191
Why don't you just call him?

05:16.191 --> 05:17.985
Because it's complicated.

05:17.985 --> 05:19.361
Yeah, Eliot hasn't talked to his dad

05:19.361 --> 05:20.696
- since he joined the army.
- All right.

05:20.696 --> 05:22.781
Wait, you haven't talked to your dad
in 60 years?

05:22.781 --> 05:25.534
It's been--
I'm not that freaking old, Breanna.

05:25.534 --> 05:26.910
Aren't you, though?

05:28.871 --> 05:30.998
Good job on the "emotional support," guys.

05:32.750 --> 05:36.545
So if you haven't seen him
in all this time, why now?

05:36.545 --> 05:39.214
I told you, I gotta tell him something.

06:16.043 --> 06:18.295
This is a lot more Smallville

06:18.295 --> 06:20.506
than I imagined your childhood to be.

06:20.506 --> 06:21.757
What did you imagine?

06:21.757 --> 06:23.425
Hmm, Gotham.

06:26.053 --> 06:27.054
Right there.

06:28.055 --> 06:29.973
I used to work
at that hardware store every day

06:29.973 --> 06:31.558
when I wasn't at football practice.

06:36.063 --> 06:37.064
Stop the truck.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.443
No!

07:03.465 --> 07:05.717
You see,
with the right combination of vodka...

07:06.760 --> 07:08.178
...couple shots of oil...

07:09.346 --> 07:11.557
...and a bit of chili pepper.

07:15.352 --> 07:16.436
Voila.

07:16.436 --> 07:17.688
Pepper spray.

07:18.730 --> 07:20.607
- Oh. [sniffs] Ugh.
- No.

07:20.607 --> 07:21.692
You okay?

07:26.780 --> 07:27.948
Eliot?

07:30.784 --> 07:32.244
What are you doing here?

07:32.244 --> 07:34.580
Wait, you know this guy?

07:36.874 --> 07:38.792
This is my father.

07:57.186 --> 07:58.645
Oh, thanks.

07:58.645 --> 07:59.730
Mm-hmm.

07:59.730 --> 08:01.565
I'm all right, really. Thanks.

08:02.858 --> 08:04.776
So what's the deal with those bikers?

08:04.776 --> 08:06.278
Those guys weren't bikers.

08:06.278 --> 08:08.405
Wait, so they were just
dressed like bikers?

08:08.405 --> 08:09.489
Uh, I recognized them.

08:09.489 --> 08:11.825
They work security for GreenSlate Energy.

08:11.825 --> 08:14.661
- Oh.
- I guess this was their poor attempt

08:14.661 --> 08:15.746
at a disguise.

08:15.746 --> 08:18.874
Why would security guys from
GreenSlate Energy wanna rough you up?

08:18.874 --> 08:21.835
They work at the fracking rig
right on the edge of town.

08:21.835 --> 08:26.715
Ever since they got here, we've had,
um, earthquakes,

08:26.715 --> 08:30.594
uh, people getting sick, hospitalized
even from the contaminated drinking water.

08:31.595 --> 08:33.305
I've been leading an effort here in town

08:33.305 --> 08:34.806
to get the rig shut down.

08:34.806 --> 08:36.767
Oh, so they were trying to shut you up?

08:36.767 --> 08:38.936
Well, listen, I don't scare that easy.

08:41.772 --> 08:45.442
I've lived my whole adult life
in this town.

08:46.443 --> 08:47.736
It means something to me.

08:48.737 --> 08:49.947
The people here...

08:51.031 --> 08:52.491
mean something to me.

08:54.368 --> 08:55.994
They're worth fighting for.

08:56.662 --> 09:00.624
So, um, yeah, how do you go
about shutting them down?

09:00.624 --> 09:04.378
Well, we have enough signatures
to petition the state.

09:04.378 --> 09:08.465
Convince the state's Attorney General
to force the fracking company

09:08.465 --> 09:12.886
to put up a $60 million bond
for reparations.

09:12.886 --> 09:14.888
And set up an independent committee

09:14.888 --> 09:18.517
to review the environmental impacts study
that they've ordered.

09:18.517 --> 09:19.893
So you've already won.

09:19.893 --> 09:22.646
Well, we'll see what the study says.

09:23.647 --> 09:27.192
The company that they've hired to do it,
Enviro Defense Group,

09:27.192 --> 09:29.027
they don't pass the smell test.

09:29.027 --> 09:31.989
So you think they were bought off
by the fracking company?

09:37.577 --> 09:41.999
Well, uh, I think we know
what we need to do.

09:41.999 --> 09:44.543
- No, I... I...
- Mm-hmm.

09:52.676 --> 09:54.094
Why are you here, Eliot?

09:55.929 --> 09:57.973
I have something that I...

09:57.973 --> 10:00.100
No, no, no--never mind.
Never mind.

10:01.101 --> 10:04.730
What did the kid mean when she said,
uh, "I think we know what to do"?

10:05.522 --> 10:06.690
I work with them.

10:07.691 --> 10:08.859
We help people.

10:08.859 --> 10:13.196
- That's what we do.
- I--I didn't ask for your help.

10:56.490 --> 10:58.658
<i>Whoa. Wait, wait, wait, wait, come again?</i>

10:58.658 --> 11:00.702
<i>Eliot's father?</i>

11:00.702 --> 11:02.371
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Yeah, yes, yes.

11:02.371 --> 11:03.914
Mm-hmm.

11:03.914 --> 11:05.457
What about my father?

11:05.457 --> 11:08.668
You know, that your dad--that your--
that your father is...

11:08.668 --> 11:10.670
<i>Bruh, you never told me?</i>

11:10.670 --> 11:11.880
I didn't tell you what?

11:11.880 --> 11:12.964
That I'm adopted?

11:12.964 --> 11:15.092
I'm adopted.
All right? It's not that big a deal.

11:16.259 --> 11:18.345
My mother worked
at the hospital where they...

11:19.596 --> 11:20.680
dropped me off.

11:22.015 --> 11:24.309
She brought me home and they adopted me.

11:24.309 --> 11:26.395
<i>See, I knew--I knew something special
about that boy.</i>

11:26.395 --> 11:28.271
<i>I said, "That boy special."
You know what, bro?</i>

11:28.271 --> 11:30.899
<i>Welcome to the cookout.
You're in the family.</i>

11:30.899 --> 11:31.942
What?

11:33.235 --> 11:36.238
So, considering
how he's reacting to you being here,

11:36.238 --> 11:37.280
you still wanna help him?

11:37.280 --> 11:39.282
I grew up in this town, too.

11:39.950 --> 11:41.034
What do we got?

11:41.034 --> 11:44.538
Okay. So this is Peter Marsh.

11:44.538 --> 11:47.290
He's the operator of GreenSlate Energy.

11:47.290 --> 11:50.752
They almost got shut down a few years ago
because of some safety concerns,

11:50.752 --> 11:52.712
but then the case just
suddenly disappeared.

11:52.712 --> 11:55.966
Well, fracking provides tens of thousands
of jobs across the country,

11:55.966 --> 11:58.593
but there's a catch.
Most of those jobs are temporary.

11:58.593 --> 12:01.638
<i>See, the companies, they hire 300,
400 people to build the rig,</i>

12:01.638 --> 12:05.016
<i>then they lay them off in favor of a
handful of engineers to keep it running.</i>

12:05.016 --> 12:07.727
A small town like this,
I mean, even short-term work,

12:07.727 --> 12:09.980
that many people,
it's gonna make a difference.

12:09.980 --> 12:11.648
Not if it's hurting people.

12:11.648 --> 12:12.816
I mean, fracking?

12:12.816 --> 12:14.484
That causes pollution,

12:14.484 --> 12:17.320
it messes up entire ecosystems,
poison the water,

12:17.320 --> 12:18.738
cause cancer.

12:18.738 --> 12:22.451
Actually, it's kinda hard to prove
the whole cancer thing in court.

12:22.451 --> 12:23.994
Seriously?

12:25.662 --> 12:27.330
<i>I'll add it to the list.</i>

12:27.330 --> 12:28.915
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

12:28.915 --> 12:30.417
Okay.

12:30.417 --> 12:34.254
All right. So Oklahoma's Attorney General,
James Hodgins.

12:34.254 --> 12:35.589
He owns a home in Carson.

12:35.589 --> 12:38.758
He's the one that ordered the study
and suspended the rig's permits.

12:38.758 --> 12:40.677
<i>Everything that I've seen, every article,</i>

12:40.677 --> 12:43.096
every case study,
it says he goes after all people equally.

12:43.096 --> 12:47.142
So he will shut the rig down then
if the study shows negligence.

12:47.142 --> 12:50.270
<i>Right.
But these are the guys running the study.</i>

12:50.270 --> 12:52.606
And, uh, they have very little experience

12:52.606 --> 12:55.400
and all the backgrounds
of people running it, shady.

12:55.984 --> 12:58.111
<i>I tried hacking GreenSlate
to see if they had any connections</i>

12:58.111 --> 13:00.405
<i>to Enviro Defense Group. Nope.</i>

13:00.405 --> 13:01.948
Both companies are completely offline.

13:01.948 --> 13:05.202
They're operating on closed systems.
So we can't get in there remotely.

13:05.202 --> 13:07.120
All right, Sophie. What's the play?

13:08.788 --> 13:10.499
<i>Um...</i>

13:10.499 --> 13:12.876
uh, right.

13:13.877 --> 13:16.546
Harry and I'll go to the capitol,
get a read on Hodgins.

13:16.546 --> 13:20.509
<i>Uh, Breanna, penetrate
Enviro Defense Group.</i>

13:20.509 --> 13:23.428
Eliot, Parker, break into GreenSlate.

13:32.187 --> 13:33.104
You okay?

13:34.105 --> 13:35.398
You know Eliot.

13:35.398 --> 13:39.236
He wears this, this coat of armor.

13:39.236 --> 13:43.156
His relationship with his father
is one of his only vulnerabilities.

13:43.156 --> 13:46.785
We mess this up, Eliot blames himself.

13:48.328 --> 13:51.164
Eliot will be the collateral damage.

13:52.165 --> 13:53.166
I can't have that.

14:01.758 --> 14:02.759
<i>Eliot.</i>

14:03.843 --> 14:05.053
<i>You all right?</i>

14:08.515 --> 14:09.516
I don't know.

14:11.476 --> 14:13.186
<i>I'm here if you need me.</i>

14:13.186 --> 14:14.271
<i>Anytime.</i>

14:20.777 --> 14:22.445
I appreciate the ride to town.

14:23.530 --> 14:25.824
I gotta make these deliveries anyway.

14:26.408 --> 14:27.993
How long have you been doing this?

14:27.993 --> 14:29.536
Couple months.

14:29.536 --> 14:31.746
People need fresh drinking water.

14:31.746 --> 14:34.457
We had a few folk end up in the hospital.

14:42.465 --> 14:44.884
What are you--what are you doing on that?

14:44.884 --> 14:47.304
Oh, see, when I go over there,
I'm going to be

14:47.304 --> 14:50.807
Kelly Johnson, the new IT member
of the Enviro Defense Group.

14:52.350 --> 14:54.060
You're hacking their website

14:54.060 --> 14:58.064
and creating an entire social media
profile on a tablet?

14:58.064 --> 14:59.149
Yeah.

15:00.525 --> 15:03.987
Why aren't you in college
or working for Google or something?

15:03.987 --> 15:05.238
Mm.

15:07.073 --> 15:08.867
You know,
you should think about your future.

15:13.413 --> 15:16.333
I see why you and my son get along.

15:16.333 --> 15:20.128
Eliot never wanted to follow the path
we set for him either.

15:20.712 --> 15:22.505
Is that why you two stopped talking?

15:26.259 --> 15:27.260
That's them.

15:35.060 --> 15:36.061
Thanks.

15:41.107 --> 15:43.735
What is it you need to say to your dad?

15:45.779 --> 15:50.617
Look, we go in, we bug Marsh's office,
and we get on his computer.

15:50.617 --> 15:52.118
Let me see that.

15:52.118 --> 15:53.870
Are we going as pirates?

15:53.870 --> 15:56.373
I love pirates! Arr, matey.

15:56.373 --> 15:57.457
Keep up!

15:58.333 --> 15:59.876
Everybody, calm down!

15:59.876 --> 16:01.878
All right? I'll find 'em.

16:01.878 --> 16:03.755
Ma'am, I need you to calm down.

16:03.755 --> 16:05.674
Hey, excuse me, I--I...

16:05.674 --> 16:07.801
Has anyone seen a python?

16:07.801 --> 16:11.179
I lost Eddie at the vet next door
and they lost him!

16:11.179 --> 16:13.139
- Did she say "python"?
- Yes, sir, she sure did.

16:13.139 --> 16:15.350
- He's this big.
- I tell you what, snakes are slippery.

16:15.350 --> 16:16.309
Slippery son of a guns.

16:16.309 --> 16:19.062
You know what I mean?
But it's okay, Eddie's a sweetheart, okay?

16:19.062 --> 16:21.815
He only attacks
if you get too close to him.

16:21.815 --> 16:23.316
You know what I mean?
I learned that the hard way.

16:23.316 --> 16:25.318
You know what I'm saying?
You gotta get everybody outta here.

16:25.318 --> 16:27.237
Everybody out!
Let them find the snake! Come on!

16:27.237 --> 16:28.321
Hurry up!

16:29.656 --> 16:30.657
Look out!

16:34.411 --> 16:35.787
Are you dying?

16:38.123 --> 16:39.124
Oh, my God.

16:39.124 --> 16:40.208
Are you?

16:40.208 --> 16:42.085
No, I'm not dying, Parker.

16:42.085 --> 16:43.169
You don't look well.

16:44.170 --> 16:45.171
Wow.

16:48.007 --> 16:51.010
You know,
maybe your dad would stop ignoring you

16:51.010 --> 16:54.222
- if you told him you were dying.
- Well, I'm not gonna do that!

16:59.686 --> 17:01.730
Ah. Hmm.

17:01.730 --> 17:02.939
Well, if you are dying,

17:02.939 --> 17:06.109
please let me know so I can have Hardison
prepare your robot body.

17:07.110 --> 17:09.195
Hmm. Check this out.

17:14.868 --> 17:16.828
 This can't be good.

17:22.876 --> 17:25.712
Hey, yo,
the office sent me to check out your tech.

17:25.712 --> 17:28.298
Nothing is uploading!
They even tried calling you.

17:28.298 --> 17:30.925
We don't upload data.
We use a closed system.

17:31.926 --> 17:34.471
HR just sent over the new guidelines,

17:34.471 --> 17:36.806
hence, why they've been
trying to call you.

17:36.806 --> 17:38.725
- H...
- Keep up, man.

17:43.563 --> 17:45.273
Dammit, I don't have a signal.

17:50.320 --> 17:53.156
Let's see if these guys
are working with GreenSlate.

18:02.832 --> 18:05.794
Remember,
politicians are ambitious by nature.

18:05.794 --> 18:10.340
Give them an opportunity and they'll
often reveal their true selves.

18:10.340 --> 18:13.051
- Thank you very much.
- James!

18:13.051 --> 18:15.512
I've been looking everywhere for you.
You almost missed our meeting!

18:15.512 --> 18:16.930
- What, uh, what? What...
- We set up the whole thing up

18:16.930 --> 18:18.473
with your secretary. Didn't she tell you?

18:18.473 --> 18:20.350
- What--who are you?
- Douglas Aaron. We met last year

18:20.350 --> 18:22.435
at that crazy convention,
State Party Legal.

18:22.435 --> 18:24.437
Now, listen,
the world doesn't want another candidate.

18:24.437 --> 18:26.564
They want a man of the people,
you understand?

18:26.564 --> 18:27.649
- Candidate for what?
- I'm sorry, we're running

18:27.649 --> 18:28.733
a little bit late. Aubrey Harford,

18:28.733 --> 18:30.902
can I introduce you
Attorney General James Hodgins?

18:30.902 --> 18:35.240
Oh, I've been, uh,
looking forward to meeting you.

18:35.240 --> 18:37.617
Douglas gave me some background
and told me about, uh,

18:37.617 --> 18:39.410
all the jobs you've created
in your hometown.

18:39.410 --> 18:41.412
Well, it's, it's nice to meet you, too.

18:41.412 --> 18:43.957
I'm embarrassed to say that,
uh, I'm a little ill-prepared

18:43.957 --> 18:45.708
- for this meeting.
- She wrote the profile piece

18:45.708 --> 18:48.753
that got Obama the speech
at the Democratic National Convention.

18:51.381 --> 18:54.467
I've been, uh, following your career.

18:54.467 --> 18:55.718
You're quite the maverick.

18:55.718 --> 18:58.638
It seems you don't just follow
partisan party lines.

18:58.638 --> 18:59.556
That's right.

18:59.556 --> 19:03.184
I believe my responsibility is to the
people, not to any one particular party.

19:03.184 --> 19:06.062
That is rare these days.

19:06.062 --> 19:08.356
With the incumbent congressman
stepping down this year,

19:08.356 --> 19:11.025
I'd say James Hodgins here
might be the man to fill that seat.

19:11.025 --> 19:14.320
- I, uh, I read about the fracking rig...
- Mm-hmm.

19:14.320 --> 19:16.072
...that went up in Carson, creating--

19:16.072 --> 19:17.490
- uh, what was it?
- Three hundred.

19:17.490 --> 19:19.826
Three hundred new jobs in the community.

19:19.826 --> 19:21.911
That is impressive.

19:21.911 --> 19:25.915
Yeah, my home is in that district, and,
uh, when I first learned of GreenSlate's,

19:25.915 --> 19:28.835
uh, intention to build in Carson,
I was skeptical.

19:28.835 --> 19:30.795
Fracking is--uh, it's controversial.

19:30.795 --> 19:32.922
But when handled correctly,

19:32.922 --> 19:36.092
it can be safe and, uh,
create an enormous amount of jobs.

19:36.092 --> 19:37.260
What about, uh,

19:37.260 --> 19:42.932
reports that the rig is damaging
the environment, making people sick?

19:42.932 --> 19:45.685
Those reports are troubling,

19:45.685 --> 19:48.855
which is why I suspended
GreenSlate's permit

19:48.855 --> 19:51.858
and I ordered an environmental
impact study that will be reviewed

19:51.858 --> 19:53.943
by a local independent commission.

19:53.943 --> 19:57.488
You spend a lot of time
in your home in Carson then?

19:57.488 --> 20:00.617
Of course, he does.
He's very close to his constituents.

20:02.535 --> 20:03.620
Okay, then.

20:03.620 --> 20:07.248
I think, uh, I'd like to follow up

20:07.248 --> 20:11.210
on this story at your home in Carson.

20:11.210 --> 20:12.712
Well, uh, I--I don't know about that.

20:12.712 --> 20:14.172
I'm--I'm--I'm stuck up here
at the capitol.

20:14.172 --> 20:16.215
Why don't you just call my office
and we'll set something up.

20:16.215 --> 20:17.759
We can finish this whole thing
in Carson.

20:17.759 --> 20:19.636
- What...
- I'll see you there.

20:19.636 --> 20:22.555
What, what, what is all of this?

20:22.555 --> 20:24.057
I don't have time
to be hanging out in Carson.

20:24.057 --> 20:25.266
Oh, now, now, spend a night

20:25.266 --> 20:28.144
or two in Carson,
let 'em see that you have a house

20:28.144 --> 20:30.021
in the district
you're gonna be representing.

20:30.021 --> 20:33.274
Committee's gonna get behind a candidate
in the next couple of weeks.

20:33.274 --> 20:34.400
It oughta be you.

20:34.400 --> 20:35.485
Don't you think?

20:35.485 --> 20:36.569
Yeah.

20:39.405 --> 20:42.116
Okay, so we didn't find anything
from the Enviro Defense Group

20:42.116 --> 20:45.578
or on Marsh's computer to suggest
that they were in league with one another.

20:45.578 --> 20:48.206
But a map that Parker found

20:48.206 --> 20:49.791
led to these permit applications.

20:51.042 --> 20:52.043
They're already filled out.

20:52.961 --> 20:56.130
The Xs on that map are where Marsh plans
to put new fracking rigs.

20:56.130 --> 20:57.590
Yeah, we can't let that happen.

20:57.590 --> 20:59.300
<i>Hodgins seems genuinely</i>

20:59.300 --> 21:01.344
proud of all the jobs
that the rigs create,

21:01.344 --> 21:03.846
so I got the impression
that he, he really would shut it down

21:03.846 --> 21:05.181
if he thought there was a problem.

21:05.181 --> 21:09.102
Okay. So this whole thing still rests
on what the Enviro Defense Group guys do?

21:09.102 --> 21:12.397
Well, Hodgins agreed to meet Sophie
and I at his house in Carson.

21:14.232 --> 21:17.110
Look at that.
His house is right next to a rig.

21:17.110 --> 21:19.696
I think we need to show him
what it's really like living there.

21:19.696 --> 21:23.616
If he is who he says he is, he's not
gonna let his constituents live like this.

21:23.616 --> 21:26.160
Let's go flip the Attorney General.

21:40.341 --> 21:41.551
Oh, good morning.

21:43.011 --> 21:44.012
Good morning, uh...

21:45.680 --> 21:46.889
Some fresh eggs.

21:47.890 --> 21:49.726
Got you some grits.

21:49.726 --> 21:53.354
Homemade biscuits and red-eye gravy,
like Mom used to make.

21:54.439 --> 21:55.940
You made all this?

21:57.316 --> 21:58.568
Yeah.

21:58.568 --> 22:00.695
Right. Today's the big day.

22:01.279 --> 22:02.280
Everybody ready?

22:02.280 --> 22:05.158
Yup. Parker and I prepped the house
before they got home.

22:05.158 --> 22:06.617
Let's do it.

22:21.424 --> 22:23.301
I went to the market this morning.

22:23.301 --> 22:27.346
Uh, I saw all you had was beer
and pickles in your fridge,

22:27.346 --> 22:30.266
so I got you some better pickles.

22:31.601 --> 22:33.269
There's nothing wrong with my pickles.

22:33.269 --> 22:36.773
These are better.
They're rustic, they're good.

22:36.773 --> 22:38.357
Made by a local vet.

22:39.108 --> 22:41.152
Why didn't you go with your friends?

22:41.152 --> 22:45.114
I figured I'd stick around
in case your biker pals stop back by.

22:46.616 --> 22:48.951
I don't need a babysitter.

23:03.883 --> 23:07.428
Remember, we just wanna show him
what fracking can do.

23:07.428 --> 23:08.930
We don't wanna hurt anyone.

23:08.930 --> 23:10.932
Um, so far, it's just some buzzing.

23:10.932 --> 23:14.227
And all the people Billy talked to
reported hearing this weird buzzing sound.

23:14.227 --> 23:16.145
It gave some of them nosebleeds.

23:18.731 --> 23:21.150
What? I--I'm not gonna give anybody
a nosebleed.

23:22.902 --> 23:24.278
You were totally gonna give
someone a nosebleed.

23:24.278 --> 23:25.988
Just a little one.

23:26.656 --> 23:28.324
- Well, just leave this out for the...
- Okay.

23:28.324 --> 23:30.743
...guests. That's...

23:30.743 --> 23:32.411
I'll be right there.

23:37.125 --> 23:39.085
- Ha! There he is!
- Hey, come on in.

23:39.544 --> 23:43.214
Alicia and my daughter have set out
some hors d'oeuvres in the living room.

23:43.214 --> 23:47.426
Oh, um, actually,
I'd really like a house tour.

23:47.426 --> 23:50.054
Really get a feel of the man
at home in Carson.

23:50.054 --> 23:51.889
Yes, of course.
Let--let's start in the living room.

23:51.889 --> 23:53.850
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

23:53.850 --> 23:55.101
Y'all hear that?

23:55.101 --> 24:00.148
What is that? Is that--does, does Carson
have a locust problem, Mr. Hodgins?

24:00.148 --> 24:02.859
I certainly hope not. Right this way.

24:02.859 --> 24:03.943
Oh.

24:05.236 --> 24:06.279
Oh.

24:08.239 --> 24:10.616
I've heard so much about you both. Welcome.

24:10.616 --> 24:13.286
You have a beautiful home.

24:13.286 --> 24:15.621
Uh, have you lived here long?

24:15.621 --> 24:17.248
We split our time.

24:17.248 --> 24:20.209
We... [laughs] we always love getting away
from the city for a bit

24:20.209 --> 24:23.129
to reconnect with our people
in the district.

24:23.129 --> 24:25.756
Play the pipes.

24:27.633 --> 24:29.552
Pipes are played.

24:29.552 --> 24:31.512
But you like it here really?

24:31.512 --> 24:35.057
Um, ooh, uh...

24:35.057 --> 24:38.060
It's just some--just some
creaky old pipes, you know?

24:39.312 --> 24:40.688
Shall we move to the kitchen?

24:40.688 --> 24:42.690
- Mm-hmm. Oh.
- Please, right this way.

24:42.690 --> 24:44.066
You sure everything's all right?

24:44.066 --> 24:47.069
Oh, yeah. It's just some
run-of-the-mill plumbing issues.

24:47.069 --> 24:50.531
We actually haven't noticed anything
too disruptive since being back in town.

24:50.531 --> 24:51.991
And sink.

24:55.870 --> 24:58.247
Oh, this is gonna be nasty.

25:04.879 --> 25:07.089
<i>Ask for a glass of water.</i>

25:07.089 --> 25:10.051
Um, actually, can I have a glass of water
before we go on?

25:10.051 --> 25:12.261
I have a little dry patch
from that delicious mushroom.

25:12.261 --> 25:14.430
Of course.

25:14.430 --> 25:16.515
Tap.

25:16.515 --> 25:18.392
Uh, actually, I prefer tap.

25:18.392 --> 25:21.938
Are you sure? Because we have ice cold
and filtered built right into the fridge.

25:21.938 --> 25:23.356
Tap is fine.

25:31.239 --> 25:32.907
Just a second.

25:37.286 --> 25:39.455
- Whoa!
- Hold the front page.

25:39.455 --> 25:41.290
Is that coming from the fracking rig?

25:41.290 --> 25:43.042
The hell is all of this?

25:43.042 --> 25:44.961
Well, let me get this straight.

25:44.961 --> 25:47.713
Even with the light and the--
and the plumbing issues

25:47.713 --> 25:50.591
and the--and the noise,
you still think the jobs are worth it?

25:50.591 --> 25:53.427
Well, well, we don't know definitively
that this is happening

25:53.427 --> 25:54.553
because of the fracking

25:54.553 --> 25:57.473
or if there are other
infrastructure problems in town.

25:57.473 --> 26:00.017
We have to wait to see
what the report says.

26:10.653 --> 26:13.030
Whoo!

26:14.031 --> 26:17.535
Breanna, I told you not to go crazy.
We're not trying to hurt anyone.

26:17.535 --> 26:21.080
That, that was not me.
I hadn't even turned on the shakers yet.

26:21.080 --> 26:24.625
That is it! We're leaving!

26:24.625 --> 26:28.629
You're right! This is insane!

26:28.629 --> 26:30.715
- Come on.
- I wanna get out of this town.

26:32.967 --> 26:36.178
And he's calling Marsh.

26:36.178 --> 26:38.389
I don't care what you are doing.

26:38.389 --> 26:40.516
<i>Drop everything, wait there!</i>

26:40.516 --> 26:42.518
I am coming over now!

26:48.607 --> 26:49.817
What?

26:50.276 --> 26:54.363
Oh, Hodgins is pissed.
Marsh squashed our bug.

26:54.363 --> 26:55.573
<i>We're deaf.</i>

26:56.741 --> 26:58.826
Is, uh, is there anything
we can help you with?

26:58.826 --> 27:01.412
No, I'm sorry, I need to cut this short.

27:01.412 --> 27:05.458
This is unacceptable and I'm gonna speak
to someone right now!

27:05.458 --> 27:06.542
Huh.

27:16.135 --> 27:19.638
I think AG Hodgins
is sufficiently motivated.

27:19.638 --> 27:23.934
Oh, what I wouldn't give to be a fly
on the wall when he gives it to Marsh.

27:23.934 --> 27:25.603
<i>I got it handled.</i>

27:26.062 --> 27:27.271
Where are you?

27:27.271 --> 27:28.773
<i>Parker?</i>

27:30.024 --> 27:32.485
I'm hanging with the AG.

27:41.994 --> 27:45.331
You tell those Enviro Defense Group nerds

27:45.331 --> 27:49.001
that that report will be ready tonight.

27:49.001 --> 27:51.754
I'm not spending another night
in this god-forsaken town.

27:51.754 --> 27:56.675
I am not giving these hillbillies
$60 million.

27:56.675 --> 28:00.012
I poured all my money into that rig.
It is time it started giving back.

28:00.012 --> 28:01.263
Fix it!

28:05.267 --> 28:08.270
We're not getting any of this.
Hey, Parker, what are they saying?

28:12.358 --> 28:16.070
Hodgins is in on it.
They rigged everything.

28:24.203 --> 28:27.331
Why would the Attorney General suspend
their license and form a committee

28:27.331 --> 28:28.791
if he was in on all this?

28:28.791 --> 28:31.335
Got half a dozen more rigs
they wanna open.

28:31.335 --> 28:33.379
The approval process
could've taken months, if not years.

28:33.379 --> 28:35.965
Yeah, but a big public validation,

28:35.965 --> 28:37.758
they would've rubber stamped them
right away.

28:37.758 --> 28:41.679
Okay. I found these legal bills
on GreenSlate's servers.

28:42.138 --> 28:45.516
Seems like there was a major case
against them that suddenly evaporated

28:45.516 --> 28:47.351
when Hodgins was named Attorney General.

28:47.351 --> 28:49.186
Yeah, as Attorney General,
he gets to decide

28:49.186 --> 28:51.605
which cases the state pursues
and which ones they don't.

28:51.605 --> 28:54.483
My guess is he did so in exchange
for a lucrative piece of the company.

28:54.483 --> 28:56.694
How did we miss this?

28:56.694 --> 29:00.114
It was wiped from the entire system
when the charges were dropped.

29:00.114 --> 29:02.992
All right. Look, listen,
we'll take the proof tonight

29:02.992 --> 29:04.285
to the committee meeting, okay?

29:04.285 --> 29:06.078
And we show them
that Enviro Defense Group,

29:06.078 --> 29:08.247
the Attorney General,
and GreenSlate are all in bed together.

29:08.247 --> 29:11.167
Anonymous trusts withholding interest
in anonymous LLCs,

29:11.167 --> 29:12.460
that's the stuff I used to draw up.

29:12.460 --> 29:14.712
No, no, that paper trail
would take forever to unravel.

29:14.712 --> 29:17.173
And we don't have time.
That meeting is in two hours.

29:17.173 --> 29:20.009
What, what, what does all this...

29:21.302 --> 29:22.428
What a waste of time.

29:22.428 --> 29:25.639
I knew I should have taken care
of this mess myself.

29:32.146 --> 29:33.606
Oh...

29:37.359 --> 29:38.777
How does this happen?

29:38.777 --> 29:40.362
Well, Breanna feels terrible. I think...

29:40.362 --> 29:43.115
No, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no. Me. Me.

29:43.115 --> 29:46.285
I mean, how did I miss this?

29:46.285 --> 29:49.288
I completely misread him. That is not me.

29:49.288 --> 29:50.623
That is not what I do.

29:50.623 --> 29:51.916
Well, reading people,

29:51.916 --> 29:55.085
spotting their strengths and weaknesses
is your superpower.

29:55.085 --> 29:57.630
But self-doubt is your kryptonite.

29:58.506 --> 30:01.467
And as I've been saying,
you've been second-guessing yourself

30:01.467 --> 30:03.427
ever since Arthur Wilde showed up.

30:05.054 --> 30:09.266
This, this, this is feeling
really complicated.

30:26.492 --> 30:29.537
It's not over. Not yet.

30:32.623 --> 30:36.085
Why are you here, Eliot?
Why did you come back?

30:37.002 --> 30:39.046
Because I have something
I wanna say to you.

30:39.046 --> 30:40.297
Now?

30:40.756 --> 30:41.840
After all these years?

30:41.840 --> 30:43.634
Now, after all these years.

30:43.634 --> 30:45.427
Well, I don't wanna hear it.

30:46.345 --> 30:49.974
If you have something to say to me,
you should have said it a long time ago.

30:52.851 --> 30:55.354
I'm sorry I wasn't here for Mom's funeral.

31:02.361 --> 31:03.571
Is that what you came back to say?

31:03.571 --> 31:06.490
Look, I know you didn't want me
to join the military,

31:06.490 --> 31:07.992
but I joined anyway.

31:07.992 --> 31:11.453
They put me in a special unit,
made us do things...

31:13.581 --> 31:16.458
Some things that I am not proud of.

31:17.042 --> 31:20.421
They didn't allow me to come back
when she died.

31:21.255 --> 31:23.632
And I wasn't here for you.

31:26.010 --> 31:29.263
All I want to say is I am sorry.

31:30.806 --> 31:33.183
You knew I didn't want you to sign up.

31:33.809 --> 31:35.311
- Why'd you do it?
- Why did I do it?

31:35.311 --> 31:37.354
Because the stories you told.

31:37.354 --> 31:40.899
Your time in the military, how you helped
everybody escape from that prison camp.

31:40.899 --> 31:42.192
I wanted to be like you.

31:42.192 --> 31:44.236
My service got me a bum hip

31:44.236 --> 31:46.363
and killed my chances
to play professionally.

31:47.031 --> 31:48.616
You had a chance.

31:48.616 --> 31:50.492
You were a natural athlete.

31:50.492 --> 31:52.411
And you were a hero.

31:52.411 --> 31:55.623
A hero? Oh, shit.

31:56.874 --> 32:00.336
You know they awarded
the Medal of Honor for that prison escape,

32:00.336 --> 32:02.171
but they didn't give that medal to me.

32:02.171 --> 32:05.299
A lily white boy from Kentucky got that.

32:05.299 --> 32:08.510
All I got was a medical discharge
and a lifetime of fighting the VA

32:08.510 --> 32:10.387
for my medical benefits.

32:10.387 --> 32:12.681
I wanted more than that for you.

32:13.349 --> 32:16.560
Your mother wanted more than that for you.

32:18.729 --> 32:20.230
I know.

32:21.899 --> 32:23.942
Hey, guys.
I think we've got something.

32:33.577 --> 32:36.413
Parker lifted a key card
from Marsh's office.

32:36.413 --> 32:38.957
- A key? What is...
- To the fracking rig.

32:38.957 --> 32:41.377
Breaking into the computer
at GreenSlate's corporate offices

32:41.377 --> 32:42.795
was easy, but of course we found nothing.

32:42.795 --> 32:44.338
That's because they didn't keep
anything important in there.

32:44.338 --> 32:46.340
Anything worth keeping secret,
they kept at the rig.

32:46.340 --> 32:48.509
All the high-tech security
is there.

32:48.509 --> 32:49.677
It's nearly impenetrable.

32:49.677 --> 32:52.096
The fracking rig
is like one big gigantic safe.

32:52.096 --> 32:55.391
But the RFID key card gets us
into the security station,

32:55.391 --> 32:57.643
and from there, I can do a lot of damage.

32:57.643 --> 33:00.938
Everything we need is in that rig. Right.

33:00.938 --> 33:03.190
- Here's the plan.
- No, stop, stop, stop! Enough!

33:03.190 --> 33:04.900
I've had it with all your plans.

33:04.900 --> 33:07.361
It's gotten us nowhere,
and that meeting is starting soon.

33:07.361 --> 33:09.613
Okay. Dad, where you going?

33:09.613 --> 33:10.864
I'm going to that committee hearing

33:10.864 --> 33:12.950
and I'm going to tell them
everything I know.

33:12.950 --> 33:15.035
I still have some weight in this town.

33:15.035 --> 33:16.036
I'll convince them.

33:16.036 --> 33:17.579
They have a restraining order
against you.

33:17.579 --> 33:18.997
They can arrest you.

33:19.665 --> 33:21.375
Let 'em try.

33:22.751 --> 33:24.378
What just happened?

33:24.378 --> 33:26.296
Like father, like son.

33:36.348 --> 33:38.642
There's way less guards here
than there were before.

33:39.560 --> 33:41.311
Hey, Eliot, heads up.

33:41.311 --> 33:44.440
<i>My bet is that they're waiting
for your dad back in town.</i>

33:44.440 --> 33:46.150
Yeah, I'll keep an eye out.

34:02.207 --> 34:04.334
You're not getting inside
that meeting, Billy.

34:04.334 --> 34:07.629
Did you forget how this went last time?

34:07.629 --> 34:09.298
Nope.

34:21.769 --> 34:25.606
No more fracking!
Kill the drill!

34:25.606 --> 34:28.859
No more fracking!
No more fracking!

34:28.859 --> 34:32.029
You ask for action and wow,

34:32.029 --> 34:34.239
they call an emergency meeting.

34:34.239 --> 34:37.701
Well, I believe the people of this town
have waited long enough.

34:37.701 --> 34:40.579
If this is the fault of the fracking rig,
so be it.

34:40.579 --> 34:43.415
If it's not,
we have other issues to address.

34:43.415 --> 34:47.920
And the report just happens
to be ready tonight.

34:48.962 --> 34:51.757
Just a fortunate, uh, coincidence.
If you'll excuse me.

34:52.591 --> 34:54.593
Are you sure you want to rush this now?

34:54.593 --> 34:56.386
I mean, if we wait just a minute,

34:56.386 --> 34:58.555
we can get press from all over the state
to attend.

34:58.555 --> 35:01.433
Don't worry.
We will have our press event.

35:01.433 --> 35:02.893
Trust me.

35:08.816 --> 35:10.108
Hey, Eliot.

35:10.108 --> 35:11.360
Yeah, Dad.

35:11.360 --> 35:14.196
What smells like a fracking rig
and screams like a girl?

35:18.408 --> 35:19.535
That's a classic.

35:21.411 --> 35:23.914
Yes, Mr. Chairman.
We're ready to present our findings.

35:23.914 --> 35:27.417
And we'll answer any questions
the committee has at this time.

35:27.417 --> 35:29.711
Parker, what do you have?

35:30.587 --> 35:32.256
Breanna is going through
their files right now

35:32.256 --> 35:34.508
and I've gotten everything else rigged up.

35:37.344 --> 35:40.055
And on the matter of methane in the water,

35:40.055 --> 35:42.724
we found no evidence
that this is related to fracking.

35:42.724 --> 35:46.019
The data points to all methane
in the area coming

35:46.019 --> 35:49.690
from bacterial decomposition
of vegetable material

35:49.690 --> 35:52.276
and other natural sources.

35:58.699 --> 36:00.325
Not bad for a man with a bum hip.

36:00.325 --> 36:03.745
Well, it looks like you learned a thing
or two in the last few years yourself.

36:03.745 --> 36:05.080
Yeah.

36:17.217 --> 36:18.927
<i>Eliot, the committee
is about to make a ruling.</i>

36:18.927 --> 36:20.012
- You ready?
- Yeah.

36:26.977 --> 36:29.104
Saw what we needed.
On our way.

36:35.485 --> 36:37.362
Too late, old man.

36:37.362 --> 36:40.741
Not only do we get
to turn the rig back on,

36:40.741 --> 36:43.869
but I'll be building
six more across the state.

36:57.841 --> 37:02.012
Wait! Wait! Listen to me!

37:02.012 --> 37:03.972
Listen! I have more evidence.

37:03.972 --> 37:05.557
We can stop them. We can shut them down.

37:05.557 --> 37:08.977
We need to get these people back to work
as soon as possible

37:08.977 --> 37:10.938
and I think the people
will be comforted to know

37:10.938 --> 37:12.648
about all the new jobs being created.

37:12.648 --> 37:15.108
Exactly. We'll be setting up
a press conference in the morning.

37:15.108 --> 37:16.693
We'll have reporters
from all over the state.

37:16.693 --> 37:18.195
Listen, we can do this.

37:18.195 --> 37:21.448
We can stop this thing!
We can stop them, we can shut them down!

37:21.448 --> 37:22.783
But we have to work together!

37:23.825 --> 37:25.285
Do something!

37:27.955 --> 37:30.624
So you're not worried
about the stories coming out of the town

37:30.624 --> 37:33.293
about water quality or health issues?

37:33.293 --> 37:34.795
Of course, we were concerned.

37:34.795 --> 37:37.506
But the report confirmed that the fracking
rig has nothing to do with it.

37:37.506 --> 37:40.759
Now, to keep that rig closed any longer,
it just hurts the people of this town.

37:41.426 --> 37:44.888
Now, speaking of jobs,
Mr. Marsh...

37:44.888 --> 37:49.434
And with this wonderful news,
I finally feel confident in announcing

37:49.434 --> 37:52.813
that GreenSlate
will be opening six more rigs,

37:52.813 --> 37:54.356
bringing us thousands of jobs.

37:56.400 --> 37:57.943
- Why are we here?
- Just...

37:57.943 --> 38:00.654
All right, Mr. Marsh.
Now, without further ado,

38:00.654 --> 38:01.780
let's turn it on.

38:03.949 --> 38:05.784
There you have it, folks.

38:14.376 --> 38:16.003
Damn! What the hell is happening?

38:16.003 --> 38:19.339
I don't know. I had the engineers test it.
It was fine last night.

38:19.339 --> 38:22.426
Are you absolutely sure
that we have to blow it up?

38:25.512 --> 38:27.139
Blowing stuff up is cool.

38:27.139 --> 38:30.058
When the rig starts, the water will flow.

38:30.058 --> 38:31.852
The lithium is going to hit the water,

38:31.852 --> 38:34.813
initiating a chemical process
that creates a flame.

38:34.813 --> 38:37.441
Since the water
is already full of methane,

38:37.441 --> 38:39.609
it's gonna causes a chain reaction
and go boom!

38:39.609 --> 38:41.236
See, we're not blowing it up.

38:41.236 --> 38:43.155
It's blowing itself up.

38:48.452 --> 38:50.162
You're certain no one was inside that?

38:50.162 --> 38:51.872
We cleared the rig
of any people

38:51.872 --> 38:53.540
and locked it up,
made sure no one got inside.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.752
Attorney General Hodgins,

38:56.752 --> 38:59.004
what do you think caused the explosion?

38:59.004 --> 39:02.007
Do you think that the Enviro Defense Group
report was wrong?

39:02.007 --> 39:03.300
No, of course not.

39:03.300 --> 39:05.802
This is clearly a machine malfunction

39:05.802 --> 39:09.181
and that there will be
a full-scale investigation.

39:10.182 --> 39:12.851
I bet he did it.
He's hated us since we got here.

39:12.851 --> 39:15.353
Hodgins, you wanna bet

39:15.353 --> 39:18.356
that the methane that's been causing
our town's water to catch fire

39:18.356 --> 39:19.649
caused that explosion?

39:20.317 --> 39:23.236
The water that the company you hired
claimed was methane-free.

39:34.122 --> 39:36.666
What a momentous occasion.

39:36.666 --> 39:38.919
You should think
about doing your press conference

39:38.919 --> 39:41.755
in front of the rig being turned back on.

39:41.755 --> 39:43.965
That would be amazing press.

39:48.887 --> 39:50.138
Excuse me.

39:52.641 --> 39:56.228
You and GreenSlate should cut your losses
and get out of town.

39:56.228 --> 39:59.606
By the time the rest of the country hears
about you clearing GreenSlate's charges

39:59.606 --> 40:02.192
so you could fund your next campaign...

40:03.235 --> 40:04.528
you're done.

40:04.528 --> 40:07.322
My what?
I don't know what you're talking about.

40:07.322 --> 40:10.784
Once we realized that you were
funding them and not the other way around,

40:10.784 --> 40:12.828
it didn't take very long
to find your secret bank account,

40:12.828 --> 40:15.038
and connect that
to your brother's secret bank account,

40:15.038 --> 40:17.040
and connect
that to the Enviro Defense Group.

40:17.040 --> 40:21.294
You see, you're gonna have
to give the great people of this nice town

40:21.294 --> 40:23.213
$60 million for their trouble.

40:23.213 --> 40:24.464
Uh...

40:24.464 --> 40:27.134
Good luck with that.

40:27.134 --> 40:29.386
Uh, this, uh...

40:48.238 --> 40:52.117
Been a real pleasure, sir.

40:53.034 --> 40:55.579
Oh, it was so good to finally meet you.

40:55.579 --> 40:58.081
I hope it's not as long
before the next time.

40:58.081 --> 41:00.375
Me, too.

41:01.084 --> 41:05.797
Next time, I'll finish telling you
about the robot bodies.

41:05.797 --> 41:06.882
Damn it.

41:06.882 --> 41:08.091
Okay.

41:11.178 --> 41:14.014
Don't forget what I said
about your future.

41:14.806 --> 41:16.057
I won't forget.

41:19.561 --> 41:20.979
What about your future?

41:20.979 --> 41:23.732
Uh, he just reminded me
to keep my options open.

41:23.732 --> 41:24.941
Hmm.

41:26.401 --> 41:28.195
Well, it all seemed to work out.

41:28.195 --> 41:29.529
Thank goodness.

41:29.988 --> 41:31.448
It was a bit close for comfort.

41:31.448 --> 41:33.742
It could have been a disaster.

41:33.742 --> 41:35.368
Thanks to you,
Eliot was able to do something

41:35.368 --> 41:37.746
he hasn't been able to do
his entire adult life.

41:38.455 --> 41:39.289
Be happy.

41:42.542 --> 41:44.419
For what it's worth,

41:45.170 --> 41:48.548
if you hadn't ignored me and joined up,

41:51.092 --> 41:53.136
you wouldn't be where you are today.

41:54.679 --> 41:57.265
Doing good for a lot of people.

41:59.726 --> 42:00.977
I'm proud of you.

42:09.152 --> 42:11.071
We wasted a lot of good years, huh?

42:11.071 --> 42:12.364
Yeah.

42:13.782 --> 42:15.992
We still have some years ahead of us.

42:18.787 --> 42:20.163
Let's make 'em count.

42:29.297 --> 42:33.802
You know, in our line of work,
we don't get recognition for what we do.

42:34.844 --> 42:38.723
We have the satisfaction of knowing
that we made a difference.

42:40.267 --> 42:43.812
And you may not have gotten a medal
for what you did,

42:45.146 --> 42:48.525
but in the eyes of all the guys
you saved...

42:50.277 --> 42:51.569
you're a hero.

42:53.321 --> 42:55.282
And for what it's worth...

42:57.534 --> 43:00.078
in my eyes, too.

43:19.139 --> 43:20.515
Try to stay out of trouble.

43:24.060 --> 43:25.228
No, sir.

43:27.355 --> 43:29.232
That's my boy.

43:56.885 --> 43:58.053
Hey.

43:59.637 --> 44:00.805
Are you okay?

45:08.123 --> 45:08.957
- Parker.
- Hmm?

45:08.957 --> 45:11.000
We're going to be here
longer than expected,

45:11.000 --> 45:13.002
then I'm not gonna waste a single minute.

45:13.002 --> 45:14.546
Breanna, I need more snowflakes!

45:15.713 --> 45:18.216
<i>Good Stewart Trucking is a piece of work.</i>

45:18.216 --> 45:22.512
We have a couple of Scrooges who are
bleeding their father's legacy for profit.

45:22.512 --> 45:25.265
The books are showing
several regular anonymous shipments

45:25.265 --> 45:27.725
<i>that don't match
with what's on the original manifest.</i>

45:27.725 --> 45:28.643
<i>So...</i>

45:28.643 --> 45:30.353
They're smuggling something.

45:30.353 --> 45:33.064
You ready?
This is the fun part.

45:33.982 --> 45:37.193
We have got a big shipment of guns
sitting on the dock.

45:37.193 --> 45:39.362
<i>We have to move the guns off the dock.</i>

45:39.362 --> 45:41.406
If we don't do this, we're dead.

45:41.406 --> 45:43.199
These shipments are off limits.
