00:00.600 --> 00:02.780
Previously on Pretty Little Liars...

00:02.781 --> 00:04.346
Is this what you're looking for?

00:04.875 --> 00:07.326
Sometimes things look bad,
and they're really not.

00:07.327 --> 00:09.483
Sometimes there's another
explanation for what's going on.

00:09.484 --> 00:11.840
And what if that explanation is even worse?

00:11.841 --> 00:13.852
How long has it been since
you've seen your Uncle?

00:14.021 --> 00:15.778
I only saw him like once or
twice a year when I was a kid.

00:15.779 --> 00:16.920
That's you.

00:17.160 --> 00:19.816
That ring. Jamie had the same ring on.

00:19.817 --> 00:22.138
As team Captain, I can't
let your slip 'n' slide

00:22.139 --> 00:23.748
affect the whole team.

00:23.749 --> 00:25.634
This is not a game to me.

00:25.687 --> 00:26.952
So are we okay?

00:27.127 --> 00:28.590
We'll talk soon, okay?

00:30.393 --> 00:32.351
Ezra said I could use the
place if he was away.

00:32.351 --> 00:33.326
Do we have a problem?

00:33.327 --> 00:34.933
Me staying here for a couple of nights?

00:34.934 --> 00:35.935
What's wrong?

00:36.114 --> 00:38.135
Look who else was in cape may that summer.

00:38.679 --> 00:39.845
Allie was pregnant. Who would she...

00:39.846 --> 00:41.106
Detective Wilden.

00:41.107 --> 00:42.734
Do you think it was Alison in the red coat?

00:42.735 --> 00:44.323
All I know is that it was a woman,

00:44.324 --> 00:46.408
and she's the one in charge.

00:48.402 --> 00:50.291
Did she show up to A.P. English?

00:50.687 --> 00:52.113
Was she even here today?

00:52.114 --> 00:54.185
I think we would know if Spencer were here.

00:54.213 --> 00:55.967
People would be running for cover.

00:56.603 --> 00:57.655
What?

00:57.996 --> 01:00.168
Look, she's hurting, and when
people hurt, they lash out.

01:00.169 --> 01:02.175
Just... give her some space.

01:02.176 --> 01:05.597
We have. But she's living
on planet freefall.

01:05.806 --> 01:06.798
Have you talked to Toby?

01:06.799 --> 01:08.707
Well, I left him a ton of messages.

01:08.708 --> 01:09.422
Think we're going to have to find out

01:09.423 --> 01:11.150
what went down from Spencer.

01:11.654 --> 01:13.832
Maybe I'll get some cupcakes
and show up at her house.

01:13.833 --> 01:15.318
She doesn't have the flu.

01:15.371 --> 01:16.955
She doesn't need ragmags and junk food.

01:16.956 --> 01:19.654
She needs to work through
this pain, not cover it.

01:19.655 --> 01:21.757
Hmm. Okay, Dr. Hannah.

01:21.758 --> 01:23.803
Pretty sure when you and Caleb broke up,

01:23.804 --> 01:25.605
you locked yourself in your
bedroom for two weeks,

01:25.606 --> 01:27.319
and all you ate was eskimo pies.

01:27.320 --> 01:29.405
They were skinny cows,
and it was four days.

01:29.406 --> 01:31.090
Besides, I'm not Spencer.

01:31.091 --> 01:32.596
I would ditch school for a hang nail.

01:32.597 --> 01:34.674
Yeah, well, I'm going over there.

01:34.817 --> 01:35.955
You need to tell her what you remember

01:35.956 --> 01:37.601
about the blonde in the red coat.

01:37.824 --> 01:39.419
And give her a riddle, she needs to use

01:39.420 --> 01:40.571
that part of her brain again.

01:40.572 --> 01:42.449
Yeah, and tell her I think I saw her too.

01:42.450 --> 01:43.788
Back up, saw who?

01:43.789 --> 01:45.381
When I went into that fake interview,

01:45.382 --> 01:47.643
I could have swore I saw a
blonde girl in a red coat

01:47.644 --> 01:49.695
staring at me across the street.

01:51.201 --> 01:53.340
No, I practiced by myself!

01:53.341 --> 01:55.065
This is a team, Spencer.

01:55.066 --> 01:56.325
And you weren't thinking about the team

01:56.326 --> 01:58.208
when you didn't show up for practice.

01:58.632 --> 02:00.195
Were those her words?

02:01.432 --> 02:03.446
Look, am I on this team or not?

02:05.030 --> 02:08.042
Not. We took a vote.

02:10.535 --> 02:12.886
Well, you can't stop me from
going to Lewisburg tonight.

02:12.887 --> 02:15.192
Look, why don't you just
reapply for the spring?

02:15.347 --> 02:17.091
Okay? Ben's graduating early.

02:17.766 --> 02:19.939
Hey, Mona. Is there anything else

02:19.940 --> 02:21.611
that you want to take away from me?

02:28.570 --> 02:29.958
I've got this.

02:32.239 --> 02:36.269
Spencer, Mona's been on that
team for like 15 minutes.

02:36.270 --> 02:38.903
She can't get away with that. She just did.

02:38.920 --> 02:39.909
Listen, I have to go to work,

02:39.910 --> 02:40.690
but why don't I come over

02:40.691 --> 02:42.254
after and we can pick up where we left off.

02:42.255 --> 02:46.467
No, I really... I can't do
this, please, not here.

03:21.334 --> 03:24.334
<font color="#40bfff">Sync by YYeTS</font>
<font color="#40bfff">Corrections by <font color="#FFA500">wilson0804</font></font>
<font color="#40bfff">www.Addic7ed.com</font>

03:30.700 --> 03:33.548
What if we talked to the teacher
who coaches the decathlon team?

03:33.549 --> 03:35.594
You had her for social
studies, what's her name?

03:37.025 --> 03:40.132
Hannah? Hannah?

03:41.646 --> 03:43.878
Why are you mapquesting Amish Country?

03:43.879 --> 03:45.516
I'm looking for a stable.

03:45.517 --> 03:47.657
Our best friend is at
home chewing her elbows

03:47.658 --> 03:49.264
and you're horse shopping?

03:49.265 --> 03:51.780
No, I'm trying to find out where
Caleb's Uncle Jamie works.

03:51.781 --> 03:53.600
Hannah, please let that go.

03:53.860 --> 03:55.607
People look like their uncles.

03:55.608 --> 03:56.802
It doesn't mean it's his dad.

03:56.803 --> 03:58.074
Look, there were other things, okay?

03:58.075 --> 03:59.113
So?

03:59.657 --> 04:01.090
Look, even if it is the truth,

04:01.091 --> 04:03.073
why would you want to know before Caleb?

04:03.074 --> 04:04.507
Hello, learn from my mistakes.

04:04.508 --> 04:05.830
This is different.

04:06.017 --> 04:08.236
Maggie didn't want Ezra to meet his kid.

04:08.818 --> 04:10.955
Jamie wants to tell him.
He just doesn't know how.

04:10.956 --> 04:12.463
And you know this because...?

04:12.464 --> 04:15.220
I saw it in his eyes when he
handed me that baby picture.

04:16.396 --> 04:17.475
Are you going to come with me?

04:17.476 --> 04:20.096
No. You're not going to go there either.

04:20.279 --> 04:21.512
Horowitz! What?

04:21.512 --> 04:22.504
The coach. That's her name.

04:22.505 --> 04:24.084
I'll just have my mom talk to her.

04:25.993 --> 04:27.093
Is that your mom?

04:27.543 --> 04:28.808
No, it's Ezra's.

04:30.175 --> 04:31.264
Oh, my God, why is she calling me?

04:31.265 --> 04:32.486
We're not friends.

04:36.419 --> 04:39.724
Hello? Oh, hi.

04:41.555 --> 04:44.505
No, I don't know. I haven't
been in Ezra's apartment.

04:45.091 --> 04:46.248
Oh...

04:46.945 --> 04:50.466
Yeah, well, I doubt that Wes
has been hiding out there.

04:51.042 --> 04:52.144
If I see him, I'll let...

04:54.626 --> 04:56.961
why does she think little Fitz
is hiding out at big Fitz's?

04:56.962 --> 04:58.119
'Cause he is.

05:01.727 --> 05:02.861
Cece?

05:03.114 --> 05:04.752
OMG, I never texted you back.

05:04.753 --> 05:05.721
No, that's okay.

05:05.722 --> 05:07.361
Um, can I stop by later?

05:07.362 --> 05:09.856
I gotta run. I'm meeting
some photographer I hired

05:09.857 --> 05:12.710
for the store's website. Everything okay?

05:13.106 --> 05:15.406
I, uh... need to ask you something.

05:15.407 --> 05:17.182
You know Darren Wilden, right?

05:17.429 --> 05:19.323
He was a couple years
ahead of you in school.

05:19.324 --> 05:20.304
He might be "the hottie"

05:20.305 --> 05:22.240
that Alison was talking
about in that notebook.

05:22.241 --> 05:24.224
And we think he might've
been in cape may the summer.

05:24.225 --> 05:26.668
Yeah, him and about four
million other delta-phi's.

05:26.669 --> 05:28.405
And they all wanted to rush Ali.

05:28.406 --> 05:30.097
But if he knew her and
now he's on her case,

05:30.098 --> 05:31.744
don't you think that... I
don't have time to think.

05:31.745 --> 05:34.733
If I don't get this website
up, I won't have a job.

05:34.740 --> 05:36.178
I'll talk to you soon, hon.

06:01.520 --> 06:03.802
Hey. Busy?

06:03.803 --> 06:05.566
Yeah. I was just about to put out a new

06:05.567 --> 06:07.673
doormat that said "go away."

06:08.403 --> 06:11.766
Spencer, I know how valuable
you are to the team,

06:12.553 --> 06:13.810
but there's a hundred-year war going on

06:13.811 --> 06:16.233
between you and Mona,
and it's a distraction.

06:16.710 --> 06:19.731
We need to be thinking of one
thing: Winning this title.

06:19.732 --> 06:21.729
You were the swing vote, weren't you?

06:23.382 --> 06:25.485
Look, we can't afford internal tension.

06:25.822 --> 06:27.726
War's a game that has to
be played with a smile.

06:27.727 --> 06:28.978
Stop quoting Mona.

06:28.979 --> 06:30.213
That's Winston Churchill.

06:30.214 --> 06:32.101
Well, he sounds a lot like Mona.

06:32.745 --> 06:34.296
And you know damn well that without me,

06:34.297 --> 06:36.602
you're going to be annihilated
in world history.

06:36.603 --> 06:37.814
Think we've got it covered.

06:37.975 --> 06:39.320
By whom?

06:39.321 --> 06:40.328
By me.

06:41.785 --> 06:42.843
Okay.

06:44.187 --> 06:46.991
Andrew, you want me to practice?
Let's do it.

06:47.042 --> 06:50.266
But if I win, you rescind your vote

06:50.267 --> 06:51.659
and you put me back on the team.

06:51.660 --> 06:52.708
I can't do that.

06:52.709 --> 06:54.420
Yes, you can.

06:54.421 --> 06:55.976
Spencer, even if I could,

06:56.765 --> 06:59.143
how do I know you're not
gonna flake on us again?

06:59.300 --> 07:01.526
Well, I guess that you
don't know that for sure.

07:02.039 --> 07:06.111
But everything in life is a
risk, and you like to gamble.

07:07.916 --> 07:09.167
New rules.

07:09.982 --> 07:12.517
For every question that I get wrong,

07:12.610 --> 07:15.365
I will take off a piece of clothing.

07:18.548 --> 07:20.143
Same thing goes for you.

07:21.266 --> 07:24.550
And the match isn't over until
one of us is butt naked.

07:25.758 --> 07:27.079
You're out of control.

07:28.267 --> 07:29.384
Not yet.

07:40.475 --> 07:41.600
Jamie?

07:42.047 --> 07:43.124
Hannah?

07:44.682 --> 07:45.878
What are you doing back up here?

07:45.879 --> 07:47.478
Oh, I was looking for a farmer's market,

07:47.479 --> 07:49.574
and then I remembered
you that worked nearby,

07:49.575 --> 07:50.695
and when I got there, they told me...

07:50.696 --> 07:51.761
Hannah.

07:52.643 --> 07:55.107
You didn't drive two hours
for a shoo-fly pie.

07:55.656 --> 07:56.742
What's up?

08:00.790 --> 08:02.656
You're his father. Right?

08:05.662 --> 08:06.868
Does he know?

08:07.758 --> 08:08.709
I'm not sure.

08:08.710 --> 08:12.452
When I floated the idea around,
he kinda just shut me down.

08:14.009 --> 08:16.455
Is there a reason that you can't tell him?

08:17.232 --> 08:18.234
Look...

08:18.235 --> 08:20.803
I've got a long history
of disappointing people.

08:21.019 --> 08:22.578
I'd rather not pass on my problems...

08:22.579 --> 08:24.321
no, he can deal with it.

08:24.903 --> 08:28.486
Hanna, I've taken a lot of shortcuts.

08:29.087 --> 08:30.092
My resume's not gonna put

08:30.093 --> 08:32.083
me in the running for daddy of the year.

08:32.085 --> 08:34.597
Okay, well, what does
that mean, "shortcuts"?

08:35.046 --> 08:38.263
Well, for starters, a police record.

08:38.337 --> 08:39.778
You were in jail?

08:40.142 --> 08:43.541
It was a long time ago.
And I didn't kill anyone,

08:43.542 --> 08:45.580
so get that look off your face.

08:46.562 --> 08:48.950
I served time for petty theft.

08:50.281 --> 08:53.984
Caleb's better off thinking
of me as the crazy-ass Uncle

08:53.985 --> 08:56.938
who climbed the fence at veterans
stadium to grab him a baseball.

08:56.939 --> 09:00.953
No, he's not. He wants you in his life.

09:01.021 --> 09:02.277
You're his father.

09:03.316 --> 09:04.962
Caleb will meet you halfway.

09:09.568 --> 09:12.569
This document, which formalized
the end of world war I,

09:12.570 --> 09:15.074
was originally known...
treaty of versailles.

09:20.818 --> 09:22.782
This proponent of establishing a nation

09:22.783 --> 09:24.787
to which former slaves
could return to Africa...

09:24.788 --> 09:26.025
Abraham Lincoln.

09:26.541 --> 09:27.719
Wrong.

09:28.297 --> 09:29.611
Marcus garvey.

09:41.032 --> 09:44.224
This bloody conflict between
the spartans and athenians

09:44.225 --> 09:45.840
lasted for nearly three decades...

09:45.841 --> 09:46.964
the trojan war.

09:46.965 --> 09:50.067
Wrong. Peloponnesian.

10:08.783 --> 10:11.699
Is that? Holy crap, it's Emily fields.

10:11.700 --> 10:14.197
Relax. You're not her type.

10:17.780 --> 10:18.799
Hi.

10:20.638 --> 10:23.946
Uhh... should I have brought more cupcakes?

10:24.517 --> 10:27.423
No, thanks. I'm leaving.

10:28.964 --> 10:30.096
Hi, Emily.

10:32.965 --> 10:36.039
What? Just trying to get
my spot on the team back.

10:36.235 --> 10:37.490
By doing what?

10:37.491 --> 10:41.628
Well, I was about to
show Andrew my cupcakes.

10:41.629 --> 10:44.050
Since when do you have to get
naked to get what you want?

10:44.051 --> 10:46.803
Since politely discussing
my intellectual prowess

10:46.804 --> 10:49.183
wasn't exactly swaying his vote.

10:49.184 --> 10:51.791
Okay, Spencer, you're way
too smart to play dumb.

10:51.792 --> 10:54.039
First you drop that bomb on
Jason, which, by the way,

10:54.040 --> 10:55.593
now I'm gonna have to un-drop.

10:55.594 --> 10:57.439
And then you jump on the
first guy that walks in here

10:57.440 --> 10:58.596
just to get back at Toby...

10:58.597 --> 11:00.834
this has nothing to do with Toby.

11:01.245 --> 11:02.820
Mona's the enemy, remember?

11:02.821 --> 11:05.430
That hasn't changed. But you have.

11:05.431 --> 11:07.968
And if you or Toby don't
tell me what is going...

11:07.969 --> 11:09.016
you spoke with him?

11:09.017 --> 11:10.123
No! Don't!

11:10.124 --> 11:11.469
Why not? He's my friend, too.

11:11.470 --> 11:13.104
No, we are not his friends.

11:13.105 --> 11:16.811
Why? What could he have possibly
done that is so unforgivable?

11:17.875 --> 11:19.826
Y-y-you can't understand.

11:19.827 --> 11:24.532
Really? Because I haven't lost
someone who I deeply love?

11:25.366 --> 11:28.600
You don't have a monopoly on pain, Spencer.

11:28.601 --> 11:30.552
Everybody has their fair share.

11:30.553 --> 11:33.054
Okay, but we get through it
because we have each other!

11:33.055 --> 11:35.126
And your friends are not
gonna stand here and watch...

11:35.127 --> 11:39.014
watch me what? Not be
Spencer Hastings anymore?

11:39.015 --> 11:41.210
Clearly, that's not working out for me.

11:41.211 --> 11:43.126
So please just get good with this, Emily.

11:43.127 --> 11:44.643
This is the new me!

11:53.979 --> 11:56.605
Whoa, are you moving in,
or are you moving out?

11:56.640 --> 11:57.676
Out.

12:02.804 --> 12:03.804
All right.

12:06.487 --> 12:08.506
I don't think that pot's disposable.

12:08.507 --> 12:10.860
There's very little pot left.
It's mostly black oatmeal.

12:10.861 --> 12:12.016
Yeah, well, you might miss it.

12:12.017 --> 12:13.651
Don't worry, my mother
will go through the trash

12:13.652 --> 12:16.348
after I'm outta here. Let her replace it.

12:17.080 --> 12:18.160
Right...

12:20.721 --> 12:22.908
She called me today. She
was looking for you.

12:22.936 --> 12:25.731
Oh, she found me. At 7 A.M.

12:26.189 --> 12:28.709
Paid the super for a spare
key and woke me up.

12:28.784 --> 12:30.455
Wait. If she knew you
were here this morning,

12:30.456 --> 12:32.894
why would she call me this afternoon?

12:32.895 --> 12:34.356
To test you. Trap you.

12:34.357 --> 12:35.827
Prove to Ezra that you're a liar.

12:35.828 --> 12:37.594
God, she is so hateful.

12:37.638 --> 12:39.300
Did I just say that out loud?

12:41.112 --> 12:42.158
Oh!

12:44.996 --> 12:47.543
So, you headed back to prep school?

12:47.544 --> 12:49.934
Nope, I was officially banished.

12:50.183 --> 12:52.452
Where are you gonna
finish your senior year?

12:52.623 --> 12:55.493
Who knows? Spain maybe. Halifax.

12:55.494 --> 12:57.892
Halifax? Why there?

12:57.893 --> 13:00.146
I have a friend who works up
there at a marine center.

13:00.147 --> 13:02.190
They save seals and track whales.

13:02.191 --> 13:03.522
It's an awesome place.

13:03.523 --> 13:05.540
I think I'd love to do something like that.

13:05.759 --> 13:06.969
That's cool.

13:09.433 --> 13:11.906
So... Uh...

13:12.218 --> 13:15.354
Why don't you just stay here
till you figure things out?

13:15.828 --> 13:17.770
Can't afford to keep changing the locks.

13:18.506 --> 13:20.881
I'll just crash on my buddy's
couch in Philly tonight.

13:23.361 --> 13:25.111
I'm just gonna leave that for Ezra.

13:25.112 --> 13:26.446
Have you heard from him?

13:26.622 --> 13:28.019
No. Have you?

13:28.446 --> 13:29.995
Yeah, mostly texts.

13:30.072 --> 13:31.064
The last time I talked to him,

13:31.065 --> 13:33.321
he was at Malcolm's soccer game.

13:34.369 --> 13:35.438
With Maggie.

13:35.800 --> 13:37.829
Hey, I wouldn't read too much into that.

13:39.240 --> 13:40.796
Tell her I'm in Canada.

13:42.263 --> 13:43.791
Hey, Cece, what's up?

13:43.792 --> 13:44.982
Please tell me you're stilling working

13:44.983 --> 13:46.025
for that photographer.

13:46.026 --> 13:47.455
I am. Why?

13:47.903 --> 13:50.595
I hired some dork off a bogus website

13:50.596 --> 13:53.052
who showed up to shoot
photos with his phone.

13:53.262 --> 13:55.324
Idiot. Any chance you could grab

13:55.325 --> 13:57.112
some decent equipment and
help me with this tonight?

13:57.113 --> 13:59.986
I'll pay you. I'll spring for dinner.

14:00.310 --> 14:01.559
Please?

14:02.489 --> 14:04.955
Is there any chance I
can bring an assistant?

14:07.116 --> 14:09.119
I never asked you for your help.

14:09.926 --> 14:11.187
You know what, I just saw him last week.

14:11.188 --> 14:13.307
If I wanted to get into this, I would've.

14:13.489 --> 14:15.821
You didn't even question
it until I brought it up.

14:15.822 --> 14:18.648
Hannah, it's not like the
possibility never crossed my mind.

14:18.851 --> 14:19.791
Okay, and if it is true,

14:19.792 --> 14:21.808
it's even more reason
for me not to meet him.

14:21.809 --> 14:22.859
Why?

14:23.201 --> 14:25.428
Maybe I'm not ready, okay?

14:25.726 --> 14:28.185
Maybe I'm not in the place
where you want me to be.

14:28.265 --> 14:29.814
Maybe you should stop
poking around in areas

14:29.815 --> 14:31.642
in my life where you weren't invited!

14:31.643 --> 14:34.957
Okay, I didn't invite you to go
hunting down "a" behind my back.

14:35.564 --> 14:39.337
Hannah, I did that out of
love and concern for you.

14:39.338 --> 14:41.530
And that's why I'm doing this!

14:42.155 --> 14:45.463
Look, he just wants to talk to you.

14:45.741 --> 14:48.677
Okay, even as your Uncle, you
should give him a chance.

14:49.127 --> 14:52.234
It's just a cup of coffee, you
can throw it on him if you want.

14:52.235 --> 14:53.982
You know what, you go, okay?

14:53.983 --> 14:55.645
He had a lot of days where he
could have made this choice,

14:55.646 --> 14:56.699
and he didn't.

14:56.700 --> 14:59.728
Instead, he let me grow up on my own.

14:59.867 --> 15:00.783
And that's where I am.

15:00.861 --> 15:02.547
I'm grown up, and I'm on my own.

15:02.969 --> 15:04.352
So I'm saying, "no."

15:04.413 --> 15:06.261
Well, he's really looking
forward to this, so...

15:06.872 --> 15:08.315
Guess I'll just be there without you.

15:08.703 --> 15:10.574
Great. Let me know how it works out.

15:15.699 --> 15:16.791
What's he so angry about?

15:19.857 --> 15:20.678
His father.

15:32.352 --> 15:34.962
Hey. What are you doing back here?

15:35.026 --> 15:38.056
I wanted to talk to you
about what Spencer said

15:38.474 --> 15:39.476
at the cemetery.

15:40.299 --> 15:42.870
You going to tell me she made
that up... Ali being pregnant.

15:43.868 --> 15:46.209
Come on, Emily, that wasn't
breaking news to any of you.

15:46.670 --> 15:49.093
It doesn't mean it's true,
just because Cece said it.

15:49.094 --> 15:52.321
Cece? Is that who set her up with Wilden?

15:52.322 --> 15:54.818
No. She doesn't even know him. I asked.

15:55.186 --> 15:57.105
I just thought it was weird
seeing a picture of Wilden up

15:57.106 --> 15:57.741
in cape may.

15:57.742 --> 15:59.141
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what picture?

15:59.294 --> 16:00.246
Where'd you see this?

16:00.353 --> 16:01.162
Police station.

16:01.598 --> 16:03.942
Wilden and a few of his
buddies holding up a fish.

16:04.505 --> 16:05.234
On a boat?

16:05.368 --> 16:07.631
Uhh, it's more of a dock. Why?

16:08.177 --> 16:10.622
Alison made my dad this collage,

16:10.623 --> 16:12.035
and there was a picture of her on a boat.

16:13.316 --> 16:14.229
What if it was Wilden's?

16:14.293 --> 16:16.062
Jason, you can't ask him.

16:16.361 --> 16:18.446
Okay, if he is trying to hide
something, it could hurt you.

16:18.447 --> 16:19.865
Don't bring up what Spencer said.

16:19.866 --> 16:21.888
It's too late. I already called him.

16:21.889 --> 16:24.151
What? What did he say?

16:24.727 --> 16:28.290
Nothing. Yet. I left a message.

16:28.899 --> 16:31.152
Would sure help, though, if I
were armed with more proof.

16:31.405 --> 16:32.673
Where is that picture of Ali?

16:33.353 --> 16:35.699
Probably in some box in
my dad's new office.

16:35.808 --> 16:36.668
Can I see it?

16:40.620 --> 16:42.140
Do you want some lemon
juice on your broccoli?

16:42.382 --> 16:43.349
Yeah, sure.

16:43.631 --> 16:45.848
Oh, we have to call mom and
dad before it gets too late.

16:45.953 --> 16:47.838
They're five hours ahead in London.

16:47.968 --> 16:48.887
Yeah, sure.

16:52.920 --> 16:53.982
Why is Wren here?

16:55.778 --> 16:56.641
Did you call him?

16:56.642 --> 16:57.822
What? No.

17:01.318 --> 17:04.542
Ahh, Melissa. Hello.

17:04.701 --> 17:06.588
Hi. I didn't think you'd...

17:06.589 --> 17:07.729
I'm sure you didn't.

17:08.469 --> 17:09.909
I heard you were back in school,

17:10.001 --> 17:10.900
finishing your degree.

17:10.901 --> 17:13.409
I am. It's taking longer than I expected.

17:13.410 --> 17:16.001
Right, well, you've been
distracted, life and all that.

17:16.217 --> 17:17.097
Hello, Spencer.

17:17.242 --> 17:19.089
Hi. What are you doing here?

17:20.512 --> 17:22.239
I think I'll dine out back.

17:23.829 --> 17:25.858
We should catch up sometime.

17:27.002 --> 17:27.803
Yeah.

17:30.876 --> 17:32.634
Really, what are you doing here?

17:32.668 --> 17:33.294
I got a call

17:33.295 --> 17:36.287
from someone who was concerned
about your state of mind.

17:36.289 --> 17:37.990
So you're making house calls now?

17:38.096 --> 17:39.606
I'm not here as a professional.

17:40.406 --> 17:44.089
Damn it. I was really hoping
for some shock therapy,

17:44.090 --> 17:46.044
but maybe you could just
wire me to a toaster

17:46.076 --> 17:47.366
and press "top brown only."

17:47.367 --> 17:49.997
Spencer, save it. I've seen this
sort of unraveling before and...

17:50.066 --> 17:52.460
and I'm what? What is the crisis, really?

17:52.461 --> 17:54.691
That I took my bra off at
four in the afternoon?

17:54.722 --> 17:56.764
Please tell Emily that I
don't need supervision.

17:56.808 --> 18:00.791
I never spoke to Emily, and I
didn't hear anything about a bra.

18:01.072 --> 18:03.855
So what, she told Hannah?

18:04.936 --> 18:06.782
Aria? I didn't speak to any of them.

18:06.783 --> 18:07.952
Who did you speak with?

18:11.121 --> 18:11.836
Mona?

18:13.666 --> 18:14.969
Mona sent you here, didn't she?

18:14.970 --> 18:18.284
Spencer, she recognizes
self-destructive, aggressive behavior.

18:18.285 --> 18:19.803
If someone had intervened on her behalf,

18:19.804 --> 18:21.201
she might not have ended up in Radley.

18:24.044 --> 18:26.972
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

18:28.302 --> 18:30.528
It was actually really
thoughtful of her to send you.

18:30.602 --> 18:32.176
Yeah. It was indeed.

18:32.757 --> 18:34.512
And if want, I can refer you to someone...

18:34.513 --> 18:36.598
what I really want is just
to get out of the house.

18:37.196 --> 18:39.130
Do you think that maybe we could just...

18:39.131 --> 18:40.245
Go to, like, dinner and a movie?

18:41.390 --> 18:42.648
A date wasn't exactly...

18:42.649 --> 18:43.700
no, it's not a date!

18:43.701 --> 18:45.266
It's a mental health outing.

18:45.821 --> 18:48.540
But I am not going to go with my doctor.

18:49.239 --> 18:51.663
Oh, let's go to that film
festival up in Bucknell.

18:52.166 --> 18:53.039
Where is that?

18:53.134 --> 18:55.152
It's up near Lewisburg.
It's really not that far.

18:55.965 --> 18:57.074
Just give me a second to change.

19:07.523 --> 19:09.161
Hey, Jamie. It's Hannah.

19:09.346 --> 19:13.953
Um... I was just wondering
if maybe you were, um...

19:16.315 --> 19:17.564
You know what, never mind.

19:17.597 --> 19:20.326
You're probably already
on your way down there.

19:20.327 --> 19:23.386
So, um, I'll see you soon.

19:36.847 --> 19:37.481
Hey.

19:37.764 --> 19:38.342
Hey.

19:42.982 --> 19:45.771
Um, if you're still heading to the brew,

19:48.210 --> 19:49.194
can I join?

19:51.014 --> 19:52.773
I don't know if I'm going to
be able to deal with this...

19:55.500 --> 19:58.457
But I know it's going to be a
lot easier if you're with me.

20:02.117 --> 20:02.988
I'm with you.

20:17.101 --> 20:18.330
Do you want me to call him again?

20:19.224 --> 20:19.872
No.

20:22.397 --> 20:23.662
Maybe he misunderstood.

20:24.766 --> 20:26.197
Maybe he thought I meant tomorrow.

20:26.617 --> 20:27.658
Or next Friday.

20:28.751 --> 20:31.314
Hannah, he had a hard enough time
being there for me as an Uncle.

20:31.792 --> 20:34.681
Okay, when I was six, he
left me with a babysitter.

20:34.692 --> 20:37.296
I had babysitters. My mom
was out all the time.

20:37.382 --> 20:38.907
Right, but she came back.

20:39.941 --> 20:41.561
Eventually the sitter called the police.

20:42.816 --> 20:44.206
That was such a treat.

20:44.801 --> 20:46.795
Answering questions, in my pajamas,

20:46.929 --> 20:49.509
about Uncle Jamie in a squad car.

20:49.733 --> 20:51.245
He's not the same person.

20:52.090 --> 20:53.046
Really?

20:54.176 --> 20:55.777
Well, you tell that to the empty chair.

20:56.894 --> 20:57.690
Let's go.

20:58.255 --> 21:01.001
Just wait. Five more minutes.

21:01.792 --> 21:02.678
Please?

21:11.655 --> 21:13.532
It would be great if you
had something round,

21:13.533 --> 21:16.558
a little tarnished, like a... old teapot.

21:16.559 --> 21:18.884
There might be something in the basement.

21:19.008 --> 21:20.050
You want me to go check?

21:20.230 --> 21:21.156
Would you?

21:21.369 --> 21:22.475
Thanks, love.

21:24.470 --> 21:25.124
I'm good.

21:27.889 --> 21:29.946
Is big brother as yummy as little brother?

21:31.562 --> 21:33.414
Ah, lucky girl!

21:34.569 --> 21:35.531
You got two for one.

21:35.532 --> 21:36.595
I've got one.

21:36.948 --> 21:38.004
He's out of town.

21:38.809 --> 21:40.430
He's dealing with some family stuff.

21:40.519 --> 21:42.273
Are you and your man good?

21:43.126 --> 21:44.470
Fine. Why do you ask that?

21:45.532 --> 21:47.832
Well, I mean, you shouldn't
be free on a Friday night.

21:48.751 --> 21:51.498
You know what they say, you can't
be with the one you love...

21:53.527 --> 21:55.420
I, uh, couldn't find a teapot,

21:55.421 --> 21:56.798
but I found some other cool stuff.

21:56.920 --> 21:58.001
That's even better.

21:59.413 --> 22:00.925
I'm going to go hunt down some dinner.

22:08.080 --> 22:09.478
Can we just get this to go?

22:10.476 --> 22:13.172
Yeah. I'll get a box.

22:22.382 --> 22:23.345
Where have you been?

22:24.316 --> 22:27.701
The trip was longer than I thought.

22:32.338 --> 22:33.317
What do you want?

22:34.292 --> 22:35.407
Anything decaf.

22:50.539 --> 22:51.763
We were just about to leave.

22:53.354 --> 22:54.740
I wouldn't blame you if you had.

22:56.963 --> 22:59.001
Can you stick around for
a few more minutes?

23:13.366 --> 23:14.707
Mmm, that looks good!

23:15.409 --> 23:17.312
They give you a discount on used cake?

23:17.515 --> 23:21.023
It was ours. We had to eat
something to soak up all this tea.

23:21.247 --> 23:21.973
Right.

23:23.379 --> 23:24.703
Um, I'd get you a fresh piece,

23:24.704 --> 23:26.157
but if I stand up again, it's to pee.

23:26.276 --> 23:28.827
And I would rather do that in my
pants than leave you two alone.

23:30.757 --> 23:31.604
Classy girl.

23:31.788 --> 23:33.631
I'm so proud.

23:40.565 --> 23:42.508
It'll take me a sec. I
know where the keys are.

23:55.036 --> 23:55.990
What is all this?

23:56.183 --> 23:57.961
Looks like someone's offering me a drink.

23:58.149 --> 23:59.446
Is this some kind of sick joke?

24:00.147 --> 24:02.298
Yeah, or how Wilden returns phone calls.

24:02.871 --> 24:04.008
Who would do all this?

24:04.560 --> 24:05.550
Unbelievable.

24:09.283 --> 24:11.080
Would you mind grabbing
that other trashcan?

24:13.783 --> 24:14.947
This is freaking crazy.

24:17.653 --> 24:18.677
I don't believe this.

24:42.551 --> 24:43.884
You sure we haven't gone too far?

24:44.858 --> 24:46.827
We're fine. I saw a sign back there.

24:46.828 --> 24:48.197
What, to New Hampshire?

24:49.391 --> 24:51.326
Trust me. It'll be worth it.

24:51.684 --> 24:54.437
Oh, I love this song.

25:03.851 --> 25:06.187
Well, I hope she wasn't planning
on drinking this for dinner.

25:07.680 --> 25:09.581
Where is dinner? She's
been gone a long time.

25:10.728 --> 25:13.556
Probably wants us to finish this
by the time that she gets back.

25:14.235 --> 25:16.526
You know what, I need
some more overhead light.

25:18.231 --> 25:19.791
Uh, what about this?

25:20.920 --> 25:21.944
Looks pretty heavy.

25:22.479 --> 25:24.255
Hey, I've lifted things
way heavier than this.

25:24.256 --> 25:26.478
Once had to carry my prom
date over my shoulder.

25:26.479 --> 25:27.565
Nice!

25:29.178 --> 25:31.313
Okay, this is way heavier
than Amber Tarsen.

25:34.295 --> 25:35.411
When did that happen?

25:38.346 --> 25:40.798
No, don't use that. Get some paper
towels and some spot remover.

25:49.560 --> 25:50.860
Whoa, how'd it get bigger?

25:51.180 --> 25:52.184
It likes water.

25:54.769 --> 25:56.629
I know I packed that picture myself.

26:00.346 --> 26:01.630
When did your dad move here?

26:02.759 --> 26:03.803
It's been a while.

26:05.072 --> 26:05.592
I think the move

26:05.593 --> 26:08.130
was more about leaving
Rosewood than anything else.

26:12.213 --> 26:13.749
I'm pretty sure it's in one of these boxes.

26:17.935 --> 26:19.839
That must've been hard. Back there.

26:21.977 --> 26:23.732
Who do you think would
do something like that?

26:24.726 --> 26:25.578
Honestly?

26:26.426 --> 26:27.189
Alison.

26:29.535 --> 26:32.356
But I don't think she's visiting
us from beyond the grave, so...

26:32.801 --> 26:33.943
I have no idea.

26:34.444 --> 26:35.019
I do.

26:37.050 --> 26:39.164
Jason, I know you think
of Mona as a friend,

26:39.438 --> 26:42.183
but she spent two years pulling
stunts like that on us.

26:42.184 --> 26:44.927
Mona is not a friend, Emily. She's a link.

26:45.283 --> 26:46.057
To what?

26:46.058 --> 26:48.660
I'm pretty sure she knows who
dug up my sister's remains.

26:48.661 --> 26:49.985
And you think she'll tell you?

26:49.986 --> 26:51.150
Well, she hasn't yet...

26:51.929 --> 26:53.124
But I'm getting warmer.

27:00.422 --> 27:01.254
You're back.

27:02.123 --> 27:03.110
Where's Caleb?

27:03.548 --> 27:04.401
With his dad.

27:05.027 --> 27:06.676
They probably didn't
even notice that I left.

27:07.507 --> 27:08.902
So, it went well?

27:09.299 --> 27:10.133
Very well.

27:10.578 --> 27:13.823
Hey, did pastor Ted hire
someone to work on the church?

27:14.312 --> 27:15.300
I don't know.

27:15.791 --> 27:16.522
Although this time,

27:16.523 --> 27:18.020
I think he'll probably look for someone

27:18.021 --> 27:19.874
who doesn't list his mother as a reference.

27:21.791 --> 27:22.434
Why?

27:22.801 --> 27:24.810
Well, he should use Jamie.

27:25.531 --> 27:27.844
Mom, he's building a stable from scratch.

27:27.845 --> 27:29.308
He can fix a bell tower.

27:29.309 --> 27:31.964
Let's just give him a reason to
stay in Rosewood for a while...

27:31.965 --> 27:34.718
slow down. Look, it's a win-win
situation for everyone.

27:34.723 --> 27:36.130
Okay, just ask.

27:36.342 --> 27:38.293
Please, Caleb really wants this.

27:39.779 --> 27:40.750
Caleb or you?

27:42.606 --> 27:44.008
Well, this is about Caleb.

27:47.963 --> 27:48.997
Is this it?

27:50.856 --> 27:51.606
Yeah.

27:54.337 --> 27:55.844
Why would Ali give this to your dad?

27:57.053 --> 27:58.391
Typical Ali move.

27:58.717 --> 28:00.937
Strolled in one day at dawn.
Father went ballistic.

28:01.564 --> 28:02.629
This was her apology.

28:03.925 --> 28:04.888
That's the one.

28:06.491 --> 28:08.774
Whose hand is that... on Ali's shoulder?

28:10.906 --> 28:12.907
Wilden. You check the other side?

28:17.073 --> 28:18.608
Cece told you she didn't know?

28:18.896 --> 28:21.317
Why did she lie? Is she protecting him?

28:21.674 --> 28:23.183
Might be protecting herself.

28:23.363 --> 28:24.036
Why?

28:24.746 --> 28:26.325
Maybe they had their own thing going on.

28:27.072 --> 28:29.065
Maybe she planned on meeting
up with him that night.

28:29.091 --> 28:29.866
What night?

28:32.189 --> 28:33.778
The last night my sister was alive.

28:57.260 --> 28:58.023
Ali?

29:03.811 --> 29:04.464
Ali!

29:19.650 --> 29:23.170
Jason, when police were
questioning you about that night,

29:23.171 --> 29:24.446
why wouldn't you just tell them?

29:24.447 --> 29:26.292
I never trusted that's what I really saw.

29:27.432 --> 29:28.595
Besides, if I had told them,

29:28.596 --> 29:30.943
that would have meant I was
awake, even for a minute.

29:31.985 --> 29:33.643
And that would have made me a suspect.

29:45.024 --> 29:46.296
Melissa give you a curfew?

29:47.724 --> 29:49.765
She probably wishes that she could.

29:50.459 --> 29:52.492
Uh, no, I just have to email my parents.

29:52.493 --> 29:53.591
It's too late to call them.

29:53.929 --> 29:55.485
But will you go in and get us a table,

29:55.486 --> 29:56.342
and I'll be right in?

29:56.567 --> 29:58.293
Yeah. Thank you.

30:14.275 --> 30:16.331
Umm... Hello. Hi!

30:16.872 --> 30:17.793
What are you doing here?

30:17.794 --> 30:20.108
Oh, Andrew, I didn't
recognize you in clothes.

30:20.109 --> 30:21.375
You know you can't be here.

30:21.376 --> 30:23.554
Relax, moose. I'm not here to see you.

30:23.822 --> 30:26.881
Uh, Spencer, what a surprise!

30:27.225 --> 30:29.858
You know, the match isn't until tomorrow.

30:29.859 --> 30:32.037
I know, I just wanted to
get up here super early,

30:32.038 --> 30:34.173
so I could get a V.I.P. seat.

30:34.174 --> 30:36.092
I promise I will not eat
into your practice.

30:36.093 --> 30:38.140
I just wanted to wish the
team Captain good luck.

30:39.268 --> 30:40.594
Hello, Spencer.

30:40.595 --> 30:43.014
Did I hear you came all this
way just to get a good seat?

30:43.293 --> 30:44.654
Two seats, actually.

30:44.655 --> 30:46.675
I'm, uh, here with Wren.

30:47.763 --> 30:48.920
We booked a room.

30:49.309 --> 30:50.677
I really want to thank you

30:50.678 --> 30:53.231
for sending the good doctor to my rescue.

30:55.586 --> 30:57.620
I only called him because you...

30:57.621 --> 31:00.297
oh, no, Mona, we know why you called him.

31:01.249 --> 31:03.611
He gives really good intervention.

31:04.512 --> 31:05.862
Actually part of my treatment plan

31:05.863 --> 31:08.157
requires me to read a case study

31:08.158 --> 31:11.895
all about a deeply disturbed teenager.

31:11.896 --> 31:13.712
Wren seems to refer to her as "M,"

31:13.713 --> 31:15.775
but we both know that this sociopath

31:15.776 --> 31:17.561
goes by other initials as well.

31:18.167 --> 31:21.596
Sounds riveting. But if you'll excuse me...

31:21.597 --> 31:24.659
I do wonder, though, how
anonymous this patient can stay

31:24.660 --> 31:27.617
once I upload the entire
case study on the Internet

31:27.618 --> 31:29.169
with your photo attached.

31:31.039 --> 31:33.914
And whose looking cray-cray now, Spencer?

31:34.294 --> 31:36.335
Have you completely lost it?

31:36.622 --> 31:38.356
Is that why Toby left you?

31:38.790 --> 31:41.712
According to your records,
Toby was never with me.

31:42.105 --> 31:43.479
But my friends still are, Mona,

31:43.480 --> 31:46.451
and you're not taking
away any more of them.

31:46.755 --> 31:49.934
And yet I don't see any of
them here with you now.

31:50.548 --> 31:53.230
Do you still have any friends, Spencer?

31:56.574 --> 31:57.643
Die! Aah! Aah!

31:59.156 --> 31:59.993
Just stop!

32:02.396 --> 32:04.415
Oh, my God, look at that.

32:04.942 --> 32:05.789
Spencer!

32:08.530 --> 32:09.428
Get off her!

32:14.844 --> 32:15.599
Fine!

32:17.969 --> 32:20.165
It's okay. It's fine, she just...

32:20.166 --> 32:21.787
She snapped. I'm okay.

32:24.978 --> 32:27.139
She is definitely gonna
know that we moved this.

32:27.140 --> 32:28.979
We'll tell her we did it for a great shot.

32:28.980 --> 32:30.813
Wes, wait, there's...

32:30.814 --> 32:32.400
There's gotta be a better solution.

32:32.401 --> 32:33.923
There is, I'll just sleep on the stain

32:33.924 --> 32:35.097
instead of the back seat of my car.

32:35.098 --> 32:36.479
Oh, what happened to the guy in Philly?

32:39.866 --> 32:40.951
There is no guy in Philly.

32:40.952 --> 32:42.543
You don't have a place to stay tonight.

32:42.954 --> 32:43.631
Aria, I'm fine.

32:43.632 --> 32:44.578
No, you're not.

32:46.235 --> 32:47.660
Stay at my place. No, I...

32:47.661 --> 32:48.669
yes.

32:48.670 --> 32:50.142
Okay, you'll sleep on our couch.

32:56.236 --> 32:58.014
Hey, Cece, where are you?

32:58.015 --> 33:00.545
Don't ask. I went to the
bar to wait for the food,

33:00.546 --> 33:02.883
I had one glass of wine, maybe two,

33:02.884 --> 33:05.465
and I come out and they
towed my friggin' car.

33:06.764 --> 33:07.448
Where are you?

33:07.449 --> 33:09.074
Do you need us to come get you?

33:09.075 --> 33:09.962
No, I'm okay.

33:09.963 --> 33:12.171
I found a credit card that won't bounce.

33:12.172 --> 33:14.681
I'm sure I'll get my car
back at some point.

33:14.682 --> 33:15.885
How are you guys?

33:15.886 --> 33:18.561
Oh, we're great! A little
starved, but we're finished.

33:18.562 --> 33:20.424
And I'll e-mail you the JPEGs.

33:20.425 --> 33:23.292
Excellent! I'm sorry
tonight was such a bust.

33:23.293 --> 33:25.907
I owe you big time. Bye.

33:25.908 --> 33:26.629
Bye.

33:28.454 --> 33:29.214
Okay, we're all done.

33:29.215 --> 33:31.749
Let's pack up and get out of here.
We can eat at my place.

33:31.750 --> 33:33.884
Aria, I'm... I'm fine in my car, all right?

33:33.885 --> 33:35.232
I've slept in the backseat before.

33:35.233 --> 33:38.287
Wes, I've seen your car. You
can't even find your backseat.

33:39.026 --> 33:39.801
Come on.

34:05.747 --> 34:07.064
They've been up there a long time.

34:07.594 --> 34:08.663
That's a good thing.

34:10.094 --> 34:12.359
Means that pastor Ted likes his ideas.

34:12.864 --> 34:15.922
Or he's freaked that Jamie got
paid at his last job in weed.

34:18.507 --> 34:21.020
Was this too much in one day?

34:21.847 --> 34:23.596
I don't know, I just thought that you guys

34:23.597 --> 34:25.574
were down the street, and... no.

34:27.295 --> 34:28.268
No, it's smart.

34:30.545 --> 34:31.810
And who knows when he would have...

34:31.811 --> 34:33.043
Made it back down here.

34:34.226 --> 34:36.500
He probably thinks I'm the
pushiest person ever.

34:39.697 --> 34:41.703
Actually, he thinks that you're remarkable.

34:44.518 --> 34:46.261
He thinks I'm the luckiest person ever.

34:49.197 --> 34:50.143
You're welcome.

35:08.489 --> 35:09.396
Amen.

35:10.880 --> 35:12.193
I see the spirit has moved you.

35:13.943 --> 35:17.035
How would you guys like to take
this to a more secular setting?

35:17.766 --> 35:18.901
Why, what's going on?

35:19.439 --> 35:22.079
Ted and Jamie are finalizing some numbers.

35:22.521 --> 35:23.516
He got the job?

35:23.517 --> 35:24.215
Yep.

35:25.864 --> 35:27.549
I suggested we celebrate.

35:28.024 --> 35:29.872
Pizza and beer, back at the house?

35:30.131 --> 35:32.537
Well, we'll have the beer, no pizza.

35:33.388 --> 35:34.938
Come on, they'll meet us at home.

36:14.325 --> 36:15.346
Are we going up?

36:21.993 --> 36:22.897
What just happened?

36:22.898 --> 36:23.702
I don't know.

36:24.614 --> 36:25.479
Should I...?

36:25.932 --> 36:27.589
I'm not sure whose gonna
answer on a Friday night,

36:27.590 --> 36:28.497
but go for it.

36:30.531 --> 36:32.476
Oh, come on... try your phone.

36:42.157 --> 36:43.447
You should probably get that.

36:48.508 --> 36:50.976
Hello, Melissa. It's Wren.
You're on speaker.

36:50.977 --> 36:52.722
Why are you answering Spencer's phone?

36:52.723 --> 36:53.441
Is she with you?

36:53.442 --> 36:56.614
She is indeed. We went to a
restaurant a little off the grid.

36:56.615 --> 36:58.401
She's a bit of a gyppy tummy.

36:58.916 --> 37:00.033
Gyppy what?

37:00.034 --> 37:01.259
Food poisoning.

37:01.260 --> 37:02.356
What did she eat?

37:02.357 --> 37:04.677
Something we probably ran
over on the way up there.

37:05.859 --> 37:07.834
We'll be home soon, Melissa. Bye.

37:07.835 --> 37:08.576
Bye.

37:16.523 --> 37:18.883
I'm going to have a hard
time taking money from Cece.

37:19.780 --> 37:22.082
I mean, how much do you think
a rug like that costs?

37:22.083 --> 37:23.689
More than she's paying us.

37:23.690 --> 37:24.799
Look, don't worry about it.

37:24.800 --> 37:27.630
I'm guessing that Cece's
made a few stains herself.

37:29.278 --> 37:30.802
Okay, that came out all wrong.

37:32.261 --> 37:33.657
You mind if I borrow something?

37:33.658 --> 37:35.750
I, uh, can't fall asleep unless I read.

37:36.396 --> 37:37.376
Yeah, me too.

37:38.723 --> 37:41.215
Your class studied the
Provincetown group in the '20s?

37:41.216 --> 37:44.391
Yep. I, uh, did a paper on millay.

37:44.392 --> 37:46.105
Nice. I did mine on O'Neill.

37:46.623 --> 37:48.826
She was, like, a major inspiration for him.

37:50.140 --> 37:52.857
"I cannot say what loves
have come and gone,

37:52.858 --> 37:55.358
"I only know that summer
sang in me a little while...

37:56.477 --> 37:58.232
That in me sings no more."

38:00.607 --> 38:02.821
I had a poetry teacher

38:02.822 --> 38:05.176
who wouldn't let me sit down
until I recited something.

38:05.418 --> 38:08.586
Yo, sorry, I'm tardy. I like to party.

38:08.587 --> 38:10.512
Yeah, no, that did not cut it.

38:13.876 --> 38:17.020
It was really fun tonight.
I'm glad you stuck around.

38:17.021 --> 38:18.807
Yeah, me too.

38:23.927 --> 38:25.101
We can't do this.

38:25.609 --> 38:28.188
No, no, we can't.

38:29.155 --> 38:29.703
Good night.

38:29.704 --> 38:30.403
Good night.

38:47.292 --> 38:48.363
You all right? Yeah.

38:49.203 --> 38:50.679
I got it. Just give me a sec.

38:58.917 --> 39:00.221
We can make that jump.

39:00.549 --> 39:02.521
Just push off, keep your knees bent.

39:02.522 --> 39:03.792
Have you done this before?

39:03.793 --> 39:04.709
Hell no.

39:06.270 --> 39:06.980
Okay.

39:11.289 --> 39:12.436
Oh, my gosh!

39:13.526 --> 39:15.528
Hey, hey, you'll be fine.

39:16.079 --> 39:17.654
You can make it. Come on, em.

39:20.696 --> 39:22.679
Hey, hey, look at me. You can make that.

39:22.680 --> 39:24.589
Who's going to hold the doors open for you?

39:27.459 --> 39:28.640
Is somebody up there?

39:29.801 --> 39:32.467
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

39:32.468 --> 39:34.105
Emily, let's go, right now.
I can't do this.

39:34.106 --> 39:35.354
I can't do this!

39:35.355 --> 39:37.261
Emily, yes, you can. You can do it.

39:37.567 --> 39:39.965
You can do it, all right. Come on.

39:40.426 --> 39:42.688
Emily, you can do this. You
gotta go now. Come on.

39:50.595 --> 39:52.185
Emily, let's go, now!

39:54.992 --> 39:57.285
Okay. I'll hold the door open for you.

40:03.341 --> 40:04.524
No!

40:05.052 --> 40:07.877
Jason! Jason!

40:08.994 --> 40:10.582
Jason!

40:14.762 --> 40:15.439
Hi.

40:17.524 --> 40:20.207
Uh, sorry, I'm not allowed
to carry that much.

40:20.621 --> 40:22.253
Ted, do you have a 20 on you?

40:22.254 --> 40:23.238
I got this.

40:23.239 --> 40:24.733
No, no, no. This was my idea.

40:24.734 --> 40:26.425
Please. It's the least I can do.

40:26.902 --> 40:29.002
Thanks. Thanks.

40:31.276 --> 40:32.523
Thanks for not giving up.

40:42.371 --> 40:44.684
Keep the change. Thanks.

41:27.369 --> 41:29.133
Did they give something for the pain?

41:29.851 --> 41:33.286
Yeah, but it's making me thirsty.

41:35.219 --> 41:35.910
Here.

41:39.296 --> 41:41.063
You're really lucky, Jason.

41:41.667 --> 41:43.328
It's amazing you survived.

41:44.343 --> 41:46.453
Yeah. This time.

41:48.510 --> 41:50.836
You and Spencer were right
about the N.A.T. club.

41:52.300 --> 41:53.699
Someone wants me gone.

41:55.963 --> 41:57.576
I don't have the picture anymore.

42:00.673 --> 42:01.520
It's gone.

42:04.029 --> 42:05.927
Hey, can you get me some more water?

42:06.526 --> 42:07.859
Y-y-yeah, sure.

42:12.917 --> 42:15.351
Emily, what happened? Where's Jason?

42:15.352 --> 42:16.727
Why were you even with him?

42:16.728 --> 42:18.956
There's a photo of Ali and Cece and Wilden.

42:18.957 --> 42:21.726
It was taken on Wilden's boat
that summer in cape may.

42:21.727 --> 42:22.653
Well, show it to us.

42:22.654 --> 42:25.043
I can't. It disappeared in the accident.

42:25.044 --> 42:26.928
What? Is Jason okay?

42:26.929 --> 42:28.228
Can we see him?

42:29.943 --> 42:32.650
Uh... yeah, he's over there.

42:32.651 --> 42:34.411
He asked me to get him some more water.

42:34.869 --> 42:35.597
I'll do it.

42:42.191 --> 42:43.029
I'm sorry.

42:45.652 --> 42:46.472
Me too.

42:47.738 --> 42:50.621
Excuse me! Where's your friend?

42:51.047 --> 42:51.711
What?

42:51.712 --> 42:53.867
The patient in bed 3, Jason DiLaurentis.

42:53.868 --> 42:54.721
Where'd he go?

43:34.061 --> 43:38.961
