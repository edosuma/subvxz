WEBVTT

00:07.875 --> 00:10.144
- What if this is Room Six?

00:10.178 --> 00:11.312
What if we're
still inside the house?

00:11.345 --> 00:13.347
- Why would this place
make another me?

00:13.381 --> 00:14.515
- Is that what I am?

00:14.548 --> 00:17.318
- My husband
will be home soon.

00:17.351 --> 00:18.419
- I'm your husband.

00:18.452 --> 00:20.521
Jules: This is not your home,

00:20.554 --> 00:22.223
and that is not your dad.

00:22.256 --> 00:24.558
- He killed himself.

00:24.592 --> 00:26.494
Do you know how badly
I've wanted a second chance

00:26.527 --> 00:29.197
to talk to him?

00:29.230 --> 00:31.199
Jules:
Whatever is going on here,

00:31.232 --> 00:34.468
we should be terrified of it.

00:34.502 --> 00:36.204
We need to find the exit door.

00:55.523 --> 00:57.525
[whispered voices]

01:00.361 --> 01:02.630
[voices whispering intensely]

01:13.541 --> 01:14.575
- [moans]

01:18.746 --> 01:20.348
- * Ho ho ho,
who wouldn't go *

01:20.381 --> 01:22.250
- Jules, let your sister
open it first.

01:22.283 --> 01:24.685
- * Ho ho ho,
who wouldn't go *

01:24.718 --> 01:26.187
* Up on the housetop--

01:26.220 --> 01:29.423
- [moaning]

01:29.457 --> 01:31.392
[indistinct voices]

01:31.425 --> 01:34.495
I've missed this.
- Pizza from Sciscilo's.

01:34.528 --> 01:37.365
- [moaning]

01:37.398 --> 01:39.200
- Jules.

01:39.233 --> 01:41.569
Jules.
- Good-bye, little sis.

*

02:28.482 --> 02:31.952
- Hey.

02:31.985 --> 02:33.954
You okay?

02:33.987 --> 02:36.257
- Yeah.

02:38.292 --> 02:41.429
- Are you sure?
You wanna talk?

02:41.462 --> 02:42.663
- No.

02:42.696 --> 02:46.767
What I wanna do
is go and get Margot.

02:49.002 --> 02:51.705
I just can't let
anything happen to her.

02:51.739 --> 02:55.743
You know, she's the closest
thing I have to a sister.

03:11.259 --> 03:14.228

- Morning, Margot.

03:58.071 --> 04:01.442
Morning, Margot.

04:01.475 --> 04:04.778
Morning.

04:04.812 --> 04:07.415
Morning, Margot.

04:09.350 --> 04:12.353
Morning.

04:12.386 --> 04:15.589
Morning, Margot.

04:15.623 --> 04:19.293
Morning, Margot.

04:19.327 --> 04:21.562
Morning, Margot.

04:23.564 --> 04:26.834
Good morning, Margot!

04:26.867 --> 04:29.470
Morning, Margot.

04:31.839 --> 04:33.841
Good morning.

04:35.776 --> 04:37.645
Good morning, Margot.

04:40.781 --> 04:42.550
Morning, Margot.

04:42.583 --> 04:44.552
- Dad?

04:46.620 --> 04:49.089
- Morning, Margot.

04:49.122 --> 04:52.092
[intense music]

[eerie music]

04:59.367 --> 05:05.939
*

05:27.495 --> 05:29.897
Hey.

05:29.930 --> 05:33.467
What would you like
for breakfast?

05:33.501 --> 05:37.137
- I don't know,
you are full of surprises.

05:37.170 --> 05:40.574
- No, not really.

05:42.510 --> 05:44.478
- Where's, um...

05:46.780 --> 05:49.383
- Jules, she left.

05:49.417 --> 05:51.952
Remember?

05:51.985 --> 05:54.388
- No, not Jules.

05:54.422 --> 05:56.624
- It's just you and me.

06:00.728 --> 06:03.531
- Hey, my head kinda hurts.
Are you having breakfast, too?

06:03.564 --> 06:05.933
- I ate.

06:05.966 --> 06:08.502
- Why didn't you wait for me?

06:08.536 --> 06:10.638
- Oh, you are full of questions.

06:10.671 --> 06:12.706
- Can you blame me?

06:12.740 --> 06:14.675
- No.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.944
Wish I had more answers.

06:16.977 --> 06:19.813
But somehow I think
I was put here

06:19.847 --> 06:22.583
because that's what
you wanted.

06:22.616 --> 06:25.853
Or needed.

06:25.886 --> 06:29.490
And I'm not gonna look
a miracle in the mouth.

06:32.960 --> 06:35.996
- Look at that,
look at that.

06:36.029 --> 06:37.931
Aren't you beautiful, Lacey?

06:37.965 --> 06:40.701
Aren't you beautiful?
That's you and me.

06:40.734 --> 06:42.736
Huh?

06:42.770 --> 06:44.838
Look at that, baby.
That's our life.

06:48.576 --> 06:50.744
You remember that?

06:50.778 --> 06:53.013
Can't you see
how much we love each other?

06:53.046 --> 06:54.848
Huh?

06:54.882 --> 06:57.618
Do you remember that?

06:57.651 --> 06:59.887
Can you see how happy
we were?

07:21.074 --> 07:23.511
Who's that? That--

07:23.544 --> 07:25.779
Is that someone you imagined?

07:27.748 --> 07:31.985
Does he really exist
or is that just pictures?

07:32.019 --> 07:34.855
- He exists.

07:34.888 --> 07:36.490
I married him.

07:36.524 --> 07:37.925
- No, no, you married me.

07:37.958 --> 07:39.893
You married me.

07:39.927 --> 07:41.795
Yeah.

08:04.718 --> 08:07.120
- Hey, look who I found.

08:11.759 --> 08:13.627
- Hey.

08:13.661 --> 08:17.998
- Did you know that it takes
40 gallons of sap

08:18.031 --> 08:21.702
to make one gallon of syrup?

08:21.735 --> 08:23.904
- Yeah, I think
you told me that once.

08:23.937 --> 08:25.939
- I guess that's why
it's so expensive.

08:25.973 --> 08:28.709
Agh!

08:32.079 --> 08:34.815
[dishes clattering,
water running]

08:41.088 --> 08:42.890
- Why'd you do it?

08:42.923 --> 08:45.025
- Do what?

08:47.127 --> 08:49.730
- Leave us.

08:53.166 --> 08:57.137
- I was, uh, hoping we could
work our way up to this.

08:59.907 --> 09:02.009
- So we can't talk about this?

09:09.717 --> 09:11.852
- If certain thoughts
are gonna hurt you,

09:11.885 --> 09:14.688
it might be best
not to think them.

09:15.823 --> 09:17.090
- Well, how am I
supposed to do that?

09:17.124 --> 09:19.727
You died.

09:22.930 --> 09:24.932
- Fair point.

09:24.965 --> 09:27.200
- Everything I've thought
since then,

09:27.234 --> 09:29.703
it brings me back to that.

09:32.139 --> 09:35.976
I found you.

09:36.009 --> 09:38.746
You didn't look like you.
Your face--

09:43.016 --> 09:44.818
You know,
death used to be this thing

09:44.852 --> 09:48.155
that was--it was out of sight,

09:48.188 --> 09:51.925
it was in hospitals
and on the news.

09:54.662 --> 09:56.664
You know, it's abstract
until it's right there

09:56.697 --> 09:59.066
in your living room.

10:02.169 --> 10:05.072
And then it's heavy.

10:05.105 --> 10:08.041
And it's cold.

10:08.075 --> 10:10.711
And it smells bitter.

10:13.914 --> 10:15.248
And, you know,
it wasn't just why you did it

10:15.282 --> 10:17.685
that I couldn't stop
thinking about it.

10:17.718 --> 10:20.821
It was--it was what it must
have felt like for you.

10:24.057 --> 10:26.259
You know, to have
your throat closing up

10:26.293 --> 10:30.163
and your eyes swelling.

10:30.197 --> 10:33.033
Being suffocated
by your own face.

10:35.703 --> 10:36.970
I became obsessed with it.

10:37.004 --> 10:38.906
I just wanted to see
what you saw

10:38.939 --> 10:41.709
and feel what you felt.

10:41.742 --> 10:44.978
Just anything that would make me
feel closer to you again.

10:58.325 --> 11:02.830
- It happened fast.

11:05.298 --> 11:08.135
And the, uh--

11:11.104 --> 11:13.941
the reaction just squeezed

11:13.974 --> 11:15.475
all the thoughts
out of my head,

11:15.508 --> 11:18.178
like toothpaste.

11:20.180 --> 11:23.016
- Like toothpaste.

11:23.050 --> 11:25.853
- The I passed out.

11:25.886 --> 11:28.021
There wasn't much pain.

11:34.094 --> 11:36.329
- Really?

11:40.167 --> 11:42.135
- Really.

11:46.273 --> 11:50.110
I love you, Margot.

11:50.143 --> 11:52.746
And I am here for you.

11:54.214 --> 11:56.183
Okay?

11:59.319 --> 12:01.521
- Okay.

12:01.554 --> 12:03.323
- More syrup?

12:03.356 --> 12:05.325
- No.
[laughs]

12:13.834 --> 12:15.836
- Okay.

12:32.219 --> 12:35.188
[tense music]

12:35.222 --> 12:40.060

12:40.093 --> 12:43.296
- Okay, let's go for a run.

[Corinne talking distortedly]

12:48.068 --> 12:55.042
*

12:59.246 --> 13:00.914
- I'm gonna go for a walk.

13:00.948 --> 13:03.050
- What?
Wait, wait.

13:05.218 --> 13:07.054
- Let go.

13:07.087 --> 13:09.156
- Stay here, hon.
- No, I wanna go for a walk.

13:09.189 --> 13:11.058
- Why?
- I need some air.

13:11.091 --> 13:13.093
- Well, I'll join you.

13:15.095 --> 13:17.831
- Um, you know, I just actually
need some time to think.

13:17.865 --> 13:20.600
I'm gonna go to my room.

13:20.633 --> 13:22.836
- Um...

13:37.117 --> 13:38.085
[knocks]

13:38.118 --> 13:40.353
You okay?

13:40.387 --> 13:43.123
- Can I just have a minute?

13:45.392 --> 13:48.128
- You can have all the time
in the world.

15:07.207 --> 15:14.214
*

15:18.351 --> 15:21.989
- Okay, so what's the plan?

15:22.022 --> 15:25.058
How are we gonna, you know,
get out of here?

15:25.092 --> 15:27.294
- If there even is
a way out of here?

15:27.327 --> 15:30.130
- We came in through a door.

15:30.163 --> 15:32.165
If there's a way in,
there's got to be a way out.

15:32.199 --> 15:34.067
Right?

15:39.406 --> 15:43.076
- She's right.
We'll find it.

15:43.110 --> 15:45.078
We'll keep looking
until we do.

15:45.112 --> 15:47.380
- After we get Margot.

15:49.116 --> 15:51.084
[knocking]

15:51.118 --> 15:53.353
- Margot.

15:53.386 --> 15:55.989
Are you ready to talk?

15:57.524 --> 16:00.093
Margot.

16:01.394 --> 16:06.499
I know you saw
what was in the trash.

16:06.533 --> 16:11.171
I'm still trying
to figure this out for myself,

16:11.204 --> 16:14.274
but I think that's what I eat,

16:14.307 --> 16:17.277
and I think
I wanted you to see it

16:17.310 --> 16:20.547
because I think that I'm gonna
get hungry again soon,

16:20.580 --> 16:22.515
and I think
it's gonna get worse,

16:22.549 --> 16:25.318
and I think
I might lose control, so--

16:25.352 --> 16:28.488
Unless you could maybe,
you know,

16:28.521 --> 16:30.623
feed me.

16:33.093 --> 16:35.328
Okay, honey.

16:35.362 --> 16:39.132
Okay.

16:39.166 --> 16:43.403
You know how much I love you.

And I know that you love me,
so...

Margot!

Could you help me, please?

16:57.150 --> 16:59.152
Look, I think that, uh--

16:59.186 --> 17:01.321
- Can you just come back
in a bit?

17:06.226 --> 17:08.061
- Uh...okay.

17:08.095 --> 17:10.297
You know, I think you're
starting to scare me,

17:10.330 --> 17:14.167
so could you open this door,
please?

Can you help me, please?

- All right, there she is.
Margot!

Margot!

- Hey, I said watch the flowers.
