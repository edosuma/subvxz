WEBVTT

01:32.342 --> 01:33.468
Fingernails.

01:37.889 --> 01:40.600
Given the state of decomposition,
they can't be Lúcia's.

01:41.893 --> 01:44.145
They're not recent.
They're at least a year old.

01:45.438 --> 01:46.731
Hand me a bag.

02:01.204 --> 02:02.414
Good morning, sir.

02:03.373 --> 02:04.416
Yes, sir.

02:09.295 --> 02:10.672
Hair.

02:10.755 --> 02:11.840
I understand, sir.

02:18.138 --> 02:21.057
But I'm afraid
this isn't gonna be that simple, sir.

02:23.226 --> 02:24.477
No, sir.

02:24.561 --> 02:26.521
No. There's no need for any of that.

02:28.982 --> 02:31.651
All right. Leave it to me. I'll…

02:32.235 --> 02:34.154
I'll talk to him myself.

02:45.623 --> 02:46.833
Marques.

02:50.795 --> 02:51.796
Marques?

02:58.970 --> 03:00.096
Listen.

03:00.805 --> 03:02.599
The judge suspended the warrant.

03:03.099 --> 03:05.060
We'll have to come back tomorrow.

03:05.143 --> 03:07.479
- What do you mean? What judge?
- Enough! Let's go.

03:07.562 --> 03:10.273
- What do you mean?
- Enough already! Let's go!

03:10.357 --> 03:13.234
This is a fucking crime scene! Damn it!

03:16.154 --> 03:20.158
Shit! Son of a bitch. Goddamn it!

03:39.219 --> 03:40.762
I need to talk to you.

03:40.845 --> 03:41.930
Paula.

03:43.765 --> 03:47.227
Have you ever noticed that this old,
hard bread

03:47.310 --> 03:49.729
can be a perfect meal for pigeons?

03:49.813 --> 03:52.774
I don't care about the pigeons.
I wanna know where my daughter is!

03:52.857 --> 03:54.317
Dreams, Paula,

03:54.984 --> 03:58.863
are nothing but our heads interpreting
our subconscious mind.

04:00.907 --> 04:02.826
The right question is,

04:03.827 --> 04:05.537
"Why do you dream about me?"

04:05.620 --> 04:07.872
They're not dreams, they're nightmares!

04:07.956 --> 04:10.583
Could it be because we're in love
with each other?

04:10.667 --> 04:11.876
Where's my daughter?

04:14.129 --> 04:17.465
I know.
I know the pain you're going through.

04:18.967 --> 04:20.510
It hurts like a motherfucker.

04:20.593 --> 04:23.346
You don't know a thing
about what I think or what I dream.

04:23.430 --> 04:25.015
You don't know anything.

04:26.182 --> 04:27.809
Do me a favor and die already!

04:28.518 --> 04:30.729
I could hear the screams of my family.

04:32.689 --> 04:33.857
They…

04:35.525 --> 04:37.360
They were screaming in my head.

04:37.444 --> 04:39.821
They screamed so loudly, right in here.

04:39.904 --> 04:42.282
They screamed so loudly inside my head.

04:44.534 --> 04:46.077
One day, I woke up

04:47.537 --> 04:50.248
and knew exactly what I had to do.

04:53.335 --> 04:57.422
I went to the kitchen and took a knife,
the sharpest I could find.

05:00.967 --> 05:03.136
And I silenced the screams.

05:05.597 --> 05:06.931
My wife

05:07.807 --> 05:09.351
and my daughter.

05:14.272 --> 05:15.607
I silenced them.

05:17.817 --> 05:19.819
Without wanting to,

05:20.403 --> 05:21.696
for no reason.

05:24.199 --> 05:26.284
I just responded to a call.

05:29.829 --> 05:33.541
I'd get a phone call every night
telling me I had to kill them,

05:33.625 --> 05:35.126
and that's exactly what I did.

05:35.210 --> 05:36.586
I got that call too.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.213
- I know.
- Before Lúcia's accident.

05:38.296 --> 05:39.881
I know everything, Paula.

05:39.964 --> 05:41.883
- So help me!
- Of course!

05:44.052 --> 05:47.138
That's why I want you to come
with me to my world.

05:47.222 --> 05:49.891
- No.
- This world has been over for a while.

05:49.974 --> 05:52.477
Why should we settle for crumbs
and scraps?

05:54.270 --> 05:57.148
As long as my daughter is alive,
this is my one and only world.

05:57.232 --> 06:00.694
Marques! Lúcia's alive! Marques!

06:01.361 --> 06:03.071
Marques! Marques!

06:05.907 --> 06:08.368
She's alive, Marques!

06:08.868 --> 06:10.453
Marques!

06:14.165 --> 06:16.876
Marques! Come back here! Marques!

06:28.263 --> 06:29.472
So--

06:30.140 --> 06:31.558
So that's really it.

06:33.893 --> 06:35.729
Did you see how Paula was suffering?

06:35.812 --> 06:39.399
- Yes. She's in a loony bin.
- Don't treat me like an idiot!

06:40.650 --> 06:42.819
You saw the exact same thing I did.

06:42.902 --> 06:45.572
Yes. It's an old hospital.
There must be blood everywhere.

06:45.655 --> 06:47.115
Go fuck yourself, Chief!

06:48.533 --> 06:50.201
I know what's going on here.

06:51.786 --> 06:54.330
- I feel like a fucking wimp!
- I understand.

06:56.916 --> 06:59.377
We all look up to you in the force,
you know?

07:00.086 --> 07:02.422
You were supposed to stand
against orders like those.

07:02.505 --> 07:05.425
Goddamn it! How do you think I got here?

07:06.343 --> 07:09.804
By going against the rules?
Or by playing their fucking game?

07:09.888 --> 07:12.265
I don't wanna play
this motherfucking game!

07:12.766 --> 07:13.767
This is wrong!

07:13.850 --> 07:16.644
There's a fuckload of things
that are wrong! This is Brazil!

07:16.728 --> 07:18.730
We play the game
so that we can stay in it.

07:18.813 --> 07:20.482
In it? In what?

07:21.775 --> 07:22.901
In what, Chief?

07:22.984 --> 07:24.235
Stop it, Marques!

07:24.778 --> 07:26.112
I'm warning you.

07:26.196 --> 07:28.740
I like you. Stop chasing this!

07:29.657 --> 07:32.869
- Stop? There's a chapel full of blood--
- Enough, Marques!

07:34.454 --> 07:37.123
- Who are you protecting?
- She's not your daughter, damn it!

07:37.707 --> 07:39.626
She's not your daughter!

07:39.709 --> 07:42.128
Saving Paula's kid won't bring back yours.

07:57.394 --> 07:58.645
What the fuck?

08:00.897 --> 08:04.818
We're going back to the clinic,
and we're going to play the game.

08:06.277 --> 08:07.529
The right game.

08:10.156 --> 08:11.408
Stop the car, Marques.

08:14.661 --> 08:16.204
Stop the fucking car, Marques!

08:21.418 --> 08:24.546
Marques, don't force me
to do something I'll fucking regret!

08:27.298 --> 08:28.508
Mmm.

08:28.591 --> 08:30.176
Mm-hmm.

09:57.097 --> 09:59.724

<i>You know I hate surprises.</i>

10:00.600 --> 10:06.147
In this particular case,
you might change your mind.

10:06.648 --> 10:08.733
<i>What happened?</i>

10:10.276 --> 10:17.617
The voltage is much higher
than we thought.

10:17.701 --> 10:20.412
<i>Did you find the exact location?</i>

10:20.495 --> 10:21.413
I did.

10:21.496 --> 10:24.416
<i>So, are we ready to proceed?</i>

10:25.250 --> 10:28.712
No, we're not yet ready.

10:28.795 --> 10:32.382
She still isn't fully prepared.

10:33.049 --> 10:35.135
And also…

10:35.218 --> 10:40.932
I need to take care of something first.

13:42.447 --> 13:44.616
<i>Gentlemen…</i>

13:45.784 --> 13:48.328
<i>…you are witnessing a miracle.</i>

13:50.372 --> 13:55.710
<i>The patient is currently</i>
<i>in a persistent catatonic state.</i>

13:55.794 --> 13:58.254
<i>No evidence of consciousness.</i>

14:00.090 --> 14:06.221
<i>The left hemisphere of his brain</i>
<i>shows no synaptic activity at all.</i>

14:06.721 --> 14:08.390
- <i>However,</i>

14:09.391 --> 14:14.437
<i>the advances</i>
<i>we've achieved in brain mapping…</i>

14:14.521 --> 14:17.023
- <i>…allow us to know</i>

14:17.107 --> 14:21.027
exactly where to generate
the electrical stimuli

14:21.111 --> 14:25.156
<i>to restore his neural synapse.</i>

14:37.002 --> 14:39.379
<i>We can therefore achieve partial recovery</i>

14:40.171 --> 14:42.924
<i>and in some cases even full recovery</i>

14:44.009 --> 14:46.678
for patients in a vegetative state.

15:46.154 --> 15:49.157
Maybe you can tell me what happened.

15:51.201 --> 15:52.827
Do you remember anything?

15:54.037 --> 15:55.413
Do you know where we are?

15:56.623 --> 15:58.625
No.

16:00.752 --> 16:04.255
You came back from a catatonic state.

16:05.298 --> 16:08.301
For many people,
this condition was irreversible until now.

16:09.302 --> 16:13.682
We were able to restore
the electrical activity of your brain

16:14.683 --> 16:17.894
without harming any other circuits.

16:17.977 --> 16:20.480
This will make you famous.

16:20.563 --> 16:22.982
You're the first person
to undergo this procedure.

16:23.066 --> 16:24.859
Do you understand what I'm telling you?

16:26.069 --> 16:29.823
You're actually famous now,

16:30.865 --> 16:32.367
Barcellos.

16:38.790 --> 16:41.251
- Thank you.

17:49.402 --> 17:52.072
- Damn it. Couldn't you have called?
- Are you alone?

17:53.448 --> 17:54.657
Yeah.

17:54.741 --> 17:56.034
Get me a drink.

17:58.703 --> 18:01.706
- Spit it out. You're scaring me.
- Get me a drink, Camila.

18:10.256 --> 18:11.466
What is it? Tell me.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.102
The place Paula told us about…

18:24.145 --> 18:25.271
…is real.

18:27.774 --> 18:29.025
Real how?

18:31.820 --> 18:34.614
The chapel's a slaughterhouse.

18:34.698 --> 18:38.910
There's blood, teeth, hair, fingernails…

18:38.993 --> 18:40.870
I've never seen anything like it.

18:42.956 --> 18:44.916
What do you mean? What about Paula?

18:48.211 --> 18:50.880
- Tell me, Marques!
- I can't do anything about it.

18:51.548 --> 18:53.717
What do you mean?
Aren't you a cop, damn it?

18:53.800 --> 18:55.969
- I screwed up, Camila.
- What did you do?

19:01.057 --> 19:02.308
My boss.

19:03.351 --> 19:07.272
He tried to stop
our investigation of the clinic.

19:09.858 --> 19:11.401
He's involved in this.

19:12.819 --> 19:14.362
We're on our own.

19:16.114 --> 19:18.575
On our own how, Marques? What's going on?

19:19.367 --> 19:21.161
The less you know, the better.

19:26.916 --> 19:29.169
Fuck!

19:29.252 --> 19:30.920
Soon they'll come and pick me up.

19:34.299 --> 19:36.134
We need someone bigger.

19:38.178 --> 19:39.429
Who, Camila?

19:42.891 --> 19:44.059
I know who.

19:44.893 --> 19:47.312
I know someone,
but Paula doesn't like him.

19:47.395 --> 19:50.106
It's Lúcia's grandfather,
Senator Antônio Mello.

19:50.190 --> 19:51.441
Maybe he can help us.

19:52.108 --> 19:54.778
- Why doesn't Paula like him?
- Paula--

19:56.029 --> 19:57.822
Paula doesn't like anyone.

20:17.384 --> 20:21.262
<i>He's gonna die, and it's all our fault.</i>

21:08.852 --> 21:10.687
Ow.

22:56.835 --> 23:00.088
My daughter--

23:00.922 --> 23:02.048
Stop!

23:04.384 --> 23:06.052
- I saw her!

23:06.136 --> 23:07.429
I saw the girl.

23:17.147 --> 23:19.941
What I'm about to tell you
will sound very strange,

23:20.025 --> 23:21.735
but I think there's no other way.

23:21.818 --> 23:24.612
Are you aware
of Paula Costa's situation, sir?

23:24.696 --> 23:26.364
Some details here and there.

23:27.407 --> 23:31.036
Senator, your granddaughter
is probably being held captive

23:31.119 --> 23:33.371
at the same clinic
where Paula is committed.

23:33.455 --> 23:34.748
Wait a second.

23:34.831 --> 23:36.958
This girl died.
That doesn't make any sense.

23:37.042 --> 23:38.126
I know.

23:38.668 --> 23:40.045
But she's alive.

23:40.128 --> 23:41.588
She's been kidnapped.

23:42.547 --> 23:46.468
Some very big fish are involved in this,
people who are above the police.

23:48.303 --> 23:50.722
This is a very serious accusation.

23:50.805 --> 23:52.057
It is.

23:53.308 --> 23:55.977
But we've got a kidnapped girl
and blood everywhere.

23:56.061 --> 23:58.021
- I think it's extremely serious.
- Blood?

23:58.646 --> 24:02.442
Senator, something very weird
is happening here.

24:03.610 --> 24:05.070
You're the only person I know

24:05.153 --> 24:08.656
with the power to take them out of there
and demand a proper investigation.

24:08.740 --> 24:10.158
Look…

24:10.241 --> 24:11.951
- Marques.
- Marques.

24:12.035 --> 24:15.830
For you to sit here with me
and throw this huge bomb on my lap,

24:15.914 --> 24:19.000
- I suppose you can prove all this.
- I can prove it.

24:19.084 --> 24:22.212
- Show me proof. I'll see what I can do.
- We're out of time, Senator.

24:22.295 --> 24:23.880
We need to get them out of there.

24:23.963 --> 24:26.758
- But what's going on exactly--
- They're hurting.

24:27.759 --> 24:29.427
We need to do something.

24:29.511 --> 24:31.304
That's not how things work.

24:31.388 --> 24:32.764
What do you think I am?

24:33.890 --> 24:36.142
- Lúcia's grandfather.

24:38.520 --> 24:39.604
Okay.

24:40.772 --> 24:42.899
I'll see what I can do.

25:02.919 --> 25:04.671
I know where she is.

25:05.922 --> 25:06.923
What?

25:08.341 --> 25:09.384
Schultz.

25:10.385 --> 25:12.679
You were there that night.
You were chasing her.

25:12.762 --> 25:13.888
No.

25:15.181 --> 25:16.599
Chasing Almeida.

25:18.059 --> 25:19.728
Almeida's a victim.

25:20.854 --> 25:21.896
I am too.

25:26.693 --> 25:27.944
I worked for him.

25:28.028 --> 25:30.113
Henrique Barcellos suffers severe stroke

25:30.196 --> 25:32.073
- For the reporter?

25:38.329 --> 25:40.957
I watched everyone at the clinic.

25:41.041 --> 25:43.376
That night, something weird.

25:53.595 --> 25:54.804
<i>I followed.</i>

25:54.888 --> 25:56.890
RESTAURANT

26:08.401 --> 26:10.487
<i>I went inside to watch the van.</i>

26:10.570 --> 26:12.614
Sorry.

26:26.878 --> 26:28.129
Help bury my dad.

26:45.480 --> 26:46.981
Why didn't you warn Lúcia?

26:49.275 --> 26:51.403
I didn't know anything.

26:51.486 --> 26:52.987
I didn't know her.

27:24.310 --> 27:25.979
So you lost her?

27:27.313 --> 27:28.690
Both her and Almeida?

27:31.443 --> 27:32.736
Not easy alone.

28:08.855 --> 28:10.440
<i>They were too many.</i>

28:14.861 --> 28:18.073
No! My arm! No!

28:18.156 --> 28:19.866
No! No, no!

28:19.949 --> 28:21.284
<i>I saw it.</i>

28:21.368 --> 28:25.747
<i>They cut off her arm,</i>
<i>then switched the bodies.</i>

28:51.481 --> 28:53.358
<i>And they burned it all.</i>

28:53.983 --> 28:55.735
<i>I couldn't stop them.</i>

How am I gonna get Lúcia
out of that clinic?

31:18.169 --> 31:19.421
By taking him down.

Come on. Let's go.

32:10.013 --> 32:11.389
He's gonna die.

32:11.931 --> 32:13.725
And it's all our fault.

32:45.173 --> 32:46.716
- Paula.

32:50.637 --> 32:52.305
It was just a dream.
