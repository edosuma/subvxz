WEBVTT

00:09.999 --> 00:11.999
Keeping Up
with the Kardashians...

00:11.999 --> 00:13.999
Lamar Odom in
critical condition.

00:13.999 --> 00:16.999
I'm gonna go back this
afternoon, see what Khloe needs.

00:16.999 --> 00:19.999
I don't think she
was leaving his side.

00:19.999 --> 00:21.999
I heard that Scott has
gone to rehab.

00:21.999 --> 00:24.999
I hope that he'll
want to stay.

00:24.999 --> 00:28.999
- So we're throwing Mom a party.
- An epic party.

00:28.999 --> 00:30.999
We're doing this video for her
60th birthday.

00:30.999 --> 00:32.999
We have to record
it in a studio.

00:32.999 --> 00:34.999
- Oh, my God.
- Who's the BeyoncÃ©,

00:34.999 --> 00:37.999
guys?
We all know it's me.

00:46.999 --> 00:48.999
There's some pics
you cannot tell you're pregnant.

00:48.999 --> 00:50.999
- It's the weirdest  thing.
- I know, it's so...

00:50.999 --> 00:52.999
Stephanie said that.
From the side, you can see it

00:52.999 --> 00:54.999
- more, but...
- I know, but, like,

00:54.999 --> 00:56.999
right now, uh, you don't look
pregnant at all.

00:56.999 --> 00:59.999
Yeah. Yeah.
I went to this Ellen DeGeneres

00:59.999 --> 01:03.999
event, and I said, "What did
show?"

01:03.999 --> 01:07.999
And she said something how she
didn't approve of gay marriage.

01:07.999 --> 01:10.999
- What?
- And so I was like, "Oh,

01:10.999 --> 01:13.999
my gosh," like, 'cause then I
guess Ellen was talking about

01:13.999 --> 01:16.999
how she just doesn't understand
how Caitlyn wants to be

01:16.999 --> 01:19.999
accepted, but she's still
Republican, so she doesn't

01:19.999 --> 01:22.999
believe in gay marriage.
So Caitlyn called me yesterday,

01:22.999 --> 01:25.999
and she was like, "You know, I
I used to think

01:25.999 --> 01:28.999
that, and now I've opened my
mind, and that didn't really

01:28.999 --> 01:31.999
come across."
And you know the headlines are

01:31.999 --> 01:34.999
gonna be, "Bruce Jenner says..."
Yeah, so she kept on referring

01:34.999 --> 01:37.999
to herself, like, twice in the
conversation, as "Bruce."

01:37.999 --> 01:39.999
And I was like, "Uh, you mean
Caitlyn."

01:39.999 --> 01:41.999
He's like, "Uh, you know
what I mean."

01:41.999 --> 01:43.999
Sh... He did think at
the time, and now she doesn't

01:43.999 --> 01:46.999
- think.
- Yeah.

02:04.999 --> 02:06.999
Would you guys judge me
if I had one more Fruit Roll-Up?

02:06.999 --> 02:08.999
I won't judge you
ever, because you're living my

02:08.999 --> 02:11.999
dream, like, you're-you're
eating everything I wish I could

02:11.999 --> 02:15.999
do.
We have so much going on in our

02:15.999 --> 02:17.999
lives.
This week, it's birthday week of

02:17.999 --> 02:20.999
hell, 'cause it's every day is a
different birthday.

02:20.999 --> 02:24.999
Caitlyn, Kendall, Mom.
So tired just thinking about it.

02:24.999 --> 02:26.999
It's, uh, just a
crazy week for everybody.

02:26.999 --> 02:28.999
We're all trying to be there to
support Khloe.

02:28.999 --> 02:32.999
Because of everything going on
with Lamar, she hasn't even been

02:32.999 --> 02:35.999
able to, like, take a breath.
Kim and I kind of took over with

02:35.999 --> 02:38.999
the party.
We're excited, but it's, like,

02:38.999 --> 02:40.999
- bittersweet at the same time.
- Okay, so Mom knows

02:40.999 --> 02:42.999
- about the party.
Mm-hmm.

02:42.999 --> 02:43.999
She just doesn't know
everything.

02:43.999 --> 02:45.999
Wait, is James
coming?

02:45.999 --> 02:48.999
He has a game
Saturday, so it depends.

02:48.999 --> 02:50.999
How do we feel that I'm going to
the game on Saturday?

02:50.999 --> 02:52.999
Yeah, you can go to
a basketball game of your

02:52.999 --> 02:55.999
- boyfriend's.
- Yeah.

02:55.999 --> 02:59.999
I mean, Khloe finally moved on.
She is dating someone new that

02:59.999 --> 03:02.999
she adores.
And then, you know, this

03:02.999 --> 03:04.999
happened, so I can't even
imagine the internal struggle

03:04.999 --> 03:06.999
that Khloe must be going
through.

03:06.999 --> 03:09.999
It must be hard for Khloe.
There's a lot of decisions that

03:09.999 --> 03:11.999
she has to make.
But we'll all be there to

03:11.999 --> 03:13.999
- support her.
- Kobe did physical

03:13.999 --> 03:15.999
therapy with him yesterday.
It was really cute.

03:15.999 --> 03:17.999
- They were saying...
- Does he remember Kobe?

03:17.999 --> 03:19.999
- Like, does he know?
- I said, I go, "Did you

03:19.999 --> 03:23.999
have a nice morning with Kobe?"
He said, "Intense."

03:23.999 --> 03:26.999
The situation right now is
incredibly fragile.

03:26.999 --> 03:30.999
Hospital life is not fun, and
it's depressing and sad, and I

03:30.999 --> 03:32.999
am very protective of Lamar
right now.

03:32.999 --> 03:35.999
I feel so guilty being away from
him.

03:35.999 --> 03:40.999
Even though I have technically
left the hospital, my brain is

03:40.999 --> 03:43.999
still at the hospital.
I get super-anxious.

03:43.999 --> 03:47.999
I was talking to the nurse, and
I said an employee at the Vegas

03:47.999 --> 03:50.999
hospital asked Lamar the day he
woke up out of a coma, can he

03:50.999 --> 03:52.999
take a picture with him?
I'm like, "If I'm not here,

03:52.999 --> 03:54.999
Lamar's never allowed to be
alone with a nurse or anyone.

03:54.999 --> 03:57.999
I don't want anyone asking him
for photos."

03:57.999 --> 03:59.999
Yeah.

03:59.999 --> 04:01.999
I have to go back to
the hospital.

04:09.999 --> 04:11.999
Do eyebrow pencils
smell?

04:11.999 --> 04:13.999
What?
What?

04:13.999 --> 04:15.999
Just kidding, it
doesn't smell like anything.

04:15.999 --> 04:17.999
Oh, my God, I was so
confused.

04:17.999 --> 04:19.999
- Do you want to know something?
- What?

04:19.999 --> 04:21.999
You have to promise
you won't tell anyone.

04:21.999 --> 04:23.999
Prom-prom.
Victoria's

04:23.999 --> 04:25.999
- Secret Fashion Show.
- Oh, my God.

04:25.999 --> 04:28.999
You're gonna be an Angel.
Or, technically, would you be an

04:28.999 --> 04:30.999
- Angel?
- N... I mean, not

04:30.999 --> 04:33.999
technically, but, I mean, I'll
be, like, a walking-on-the-

04:33.999 --> 04:36.999
runway Angel.
I cannot believe that this

04:36.999 --> 04:39.999
Victoria's Secret show's
actually happening, 'cause it's

04:39.999 --> 04:40.999
something that I've always
wanted to do.

04:40.999 --> 04:42.999
What do you want to
do, Kendall?

04:42.999 --> 04:44.999
- Model.
- You know, Kendall's

04:44.999 --> 04:46.999
dream is to be a Victoria's
Secret model.

04:46.999 --> 04:48.999
And I'm really
excited.

04:48.999 --> 04:50.999
- That is so amazing.
- I, like, cried when

04:50.999 --> 04:52.999
Mom told me.
But, yeah, I mean, you know how

04:52.999 --> 04:55.999
- long I've wanted to do this.
- Mmm, I bet.

04:55.999 --> 04:57.999
- When is it?
- The 10th.

04:57.999 --> 05:01.999
Okay, dope.
I think I'm going to, um, Dad's

05:01.999 --> 05:03.999
thing on the 9th or
something.

05:03.999 --> 05:05.999
- Oh, sick.
- So maybe we should

05:05.999 --> 05:08.999
- come and support.
- Um...

05:08.999 --> 05:11.999
I mean, yeah.
I... I'm still, like, figuring

05:11.999 --> 05:16.999
all of that out and, like,
figuring out what I want to do.

05:16.999 --> 05:19.999
You know, I already feel like
sometimes I have to, like, prove

05:19.999 --> 05:21.999
myself in the industry that I'm
in.

05:21.999 --> 05:23.999
I'm just trying to be
professional.

05:23.999 --> 05:26.999
So to have my whole family
sitting there, it's a media

05:26.999 --> 05:28.999
frenzy.
I just want to, like, do the

05:28.999 --> 05:31.999
show and not have to worry about
anything else.

05:31.999 --> 05:33.999
I mean, obviously, I want you
guys there, but I'm just

05:33.999 --> 05:37.999
- thinking about it.
- Okay.

05:51.999 --> 05:55.999
I want to get one of
those, um, some cool jackets.

05:55.999 --> 06:01.999
So let me go to my app.
How do you feel today?

06:01.999 --> 06:04.999
Good.
So I want to tell you about your

06:04.999 --> 06:06.999
birthday party.
We want you to be as surprised

06:06.999 --> 06:09.999
as possible and just, like, not
really be a part of it, but I

06:09.999 --> 06:12.999
think you need to know the dress
code because it is

06:12.999 --> 06:15.999
- theme.
- Stop. Oh, my God.

06:15.999 --> 06:17.999
- Yeah. Swear.
- So much fun.

06:17.999 --> 06:21.999
'20s, glam, black tie.
Like, so major.

06:21.999 --> 06:23.999
- You're gonna die.
- Oh, my God.

06:23.999 --> 06:25.999
I think you should
either do, like, a long gown,

06:25.999 --> 06:28.999
uh, or, like, really, really
short, you know?

06:28.999 --> 06:30.999
- With, like, fringe?
- That's gonna be fun.

06:30.999 --> 06:32.999
I like a theme.
that theme.

06:32.999 --> 06:35.999
I'm just, you know, we
were, like, debating, do we

06:35.999 --> 06:37.999
change the date, do we keep the
date? 'Cause it's the day after

06:37.999 --> 06:40.999
your birthday, which is
Lamar's real birthday.

06:40.999 --> 06:43.999
- But we can celebrate him too.
- Yeah.

06:43.999 --> 06:47.999
It's a celebration.
I'm so overwhelmed with what's

06:47.999 --> 06:50.999
going on with Lamar, but at the
same time, my kids have been

06:50.999 --> 06:54.999
putting a lot into my birthday
party, and it makes me feel

06:54.999 --> 06:57.999
really, really good that they
would even want to do something

06:57.999 --> 07:00.999
like this for me.
All right.

07:00.999 --> 07:02.999
Well, I'm excited.
And really old.

07:16.999 --> 07:19.999
Uh... so, for Mom's

07:19.999 --> 07:21.999
video, did we ask Cici to send a
clip?

07:21.999 --> 07:23.999
I'm calling her right
now-- this is absolutely

07:23.999 --> 07:27.999
disgusting.

07:27.999 --> 07:29.999
Donna, two seconds.
I'm with Kourtney.

07:29.999 --> 07:33.999
Did we ask you to give us a
video that says she loves you.

07:33.999 --> 07:35.999
- No!
- What the?

07:35.999 --> 07:38.999
- Oh, my God!
- Chaunch!

07:38.999 --> 07:41.999
We asked my mom's old friends
and family members to record

07:41.999 --> 07:44.999
their own part to include in
the video, and now we're just

07:44.999 --> 07:47.999
trying to get everyone to send
them.

07:47.999 --> 07:50.999
Listen, Kourtney's
baby daddy's in rehab, my

07:50.999 --> 07:53.999
something's in the hospital,
our brains are crazy.

07:53.999 --> 07:56.999
Come on, you "shabba shauncy
shoon," let's do this.

07:56.999 --> 07:59.999
- I just washed my hair.
- Put your hair up

07:59.999 --> 08:01.999
in a towel and just say she
loves you.

08:01.999 --> 08:04.999
- Oh, you're gonna die!
- Okay, bye.

08:04.999 --> 08:07.999
I'm going to
therapy today with Scott at the

08:07.999 --> 08:10.999
- rehab place.
- How do you feel?

08:10.999 --> 08:13.000
Uh, I'm fine.
Just anxious. I hate doing that

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
- kind of stuff.
- Why?

08:15.000 --> 08:17.999
I don't know.
Just, like, annoying that, you

08:17.999 --> 08:19.999
know, you have to go, like, talk
about...

08:19.999 --> 08:20.999
The same thing over
and over again?

08:20.999 --> 08:23.000
- Yeah.
- It's so draining.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.999
- Your second time seeing him?
Mm-hmm.

08:26.999 --> 08:31.999
Even though mine and
Kourtney's situations are very

08:31.999 --> 08:34.999
different, we're going
through... so many of the same

08:34.999 --> 08:39.999
things, and it's so hard.
Like, it's like playing a

08:39.999 --> 08:43.000
tug-of-war with your heart.
We're stuck to them, somehow,

08:43.000 --> 08:46.999
but we still want to, like,
proceed with our lives.

08:46.999 --> 08:48.999
We don't know what's right or
wrong.

08:48.999 --> 08:50.999
It's... I don't... it's just
crazy.

08:50.999 --> 08:55.999
The amount of pressure that's on
me... they all say, "You know

08:55.999 --> 08:58.000
Lamar wouldn't be surviving if
it wasn't for you.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.999
You know Lamar.
Well, don't leave here without

09:00.999 --> 09:03.999
Lamar."
I'm not, you guys, okay?

09:03.999 --> 09:05.999
I'm trying.
But I had a life before this

09:05.999 --> 09:07.999
- happened.
Mm-hmm.

09:07.999 --> 09:09.999
So, why does everyone
forget this whole situation and

09:09.999 --> 09:11.999
- want me to ruin my life?
- Well, who cares

09:11.999 --> 09:13.999
about what everyone else thinks?
It's about what you know.

09:13.999 --> 09:15.999
You just need to be confident in
your decision.

09:15.999 --> 09:18.999
And I want to live the
life that I was already living

09:18.999 --> 09:22.999
before this whole thing
happened!

09:22.999 --> 09:24.999
Kylie, why aren't you taking
this seriously?

09:24.999 --> 09:25.999
Yeah, you're
so annoying.

09:25.999 --> 09:27.999
Because I'm having
issues...

09:27.999 --> 09:29.999
But it doesn't matter.
This is about somebody else!

09:29.999 --> 09:33.000
- I'm going to cry!
- Tonight is the big

09:33.000 --> 09:37.999
night and I'm really, really
excited.

09:43.999 --> 09:45.999
I had a life before
this happened.

09:45.999 --> 09:47.999
Mm-hmm.
- So, why does everyone

09:47.999 --> 09:49.999
forget this whole situation and
want me to ruin my life?

09:49.999 --> 09:51.999
Well, who cares
what everyone else thinks?

09:51.999 --> 09:53.999
It's about what you know.
You just need to be confident in

09:53.999 --> 09:55.999
- your decision.
- And I want to live the

09:55.999 --> 09:58.999
life that I was already living
before this whole thing

09:58.999 --> 10:00.999
- happened.
- I mean, you

10:00.999 --> 10:03.999
- shouldn't feel guilty.
- Yeah.

10:03.999 --> 10:06.999
You have to take
care of yourself, too.

10:06.999 --> 10:11.999
I mean, I know I have
to start my daily routines again

10:11.999 --> 10:15.999
and I have to get back to my
normal life, but it's hard to

10:15.999 --> 10:20.999
not feel guilty.
Going to work or, you know,

10:20.999 --> 10:24.999
promoting my book or things like
that, that I was so excited

10:24.999 --> 10:29.999
- about, I feel, like, selfish.
- But just when you

10:29.999 --> 10:32.999
- make plans, God laughs.
- Oh, don't steal my

10:32.999 --> 10:34.999
quotes.

10:34.999 --> 10:37.999
Oh, my God!
What?!

10:37.999 --> 10:40.999
- Cici, yes!
- Wait, Donna...

10:40.999 --> 10:43.999
Just look at the
visual, just look.

10:43.999 --> 10:47.999
She loves you.

10:47.999 --> 10:49.999
Don't put my bra in there.

10:49.999 --> 10:52.999
- Just the front part.
- What do you mean?

10:52.999 --> 10:56.999
- It has to be.
- Oh, no!

10:56.999 --> 11:08.999
Don't put the fr--âª âª

11:08.999 --> 11:10.999
I have stuff in here,
I swear to God, older than you

11:10.999 --> 11:12.999
- are.
- Is there a picture

11:12.999 --> 11:14.999
- of you actually wearing this?
- Yes! Oh, my God, I--

11:14.999 --> 11:16.999
Was the, were the
pictures black and white back

11:16.999 --> 11:18.999
- then? Can you tell, like--?
- Oh, my God, okay.

11:18.999 --> 11:21.999
- You're grounded.
- No, they're  color.

11:21.999 --> 11:23.999
Leave it to you to cheer my up,
Jonathan.

11:23.999 --> 11:25.999
Why are you upset?
I don't even, like, believe that

11:25.999 --> 11:28.999
you're 60.
I know.

11:28.999 --> 11:30.999
How cool is that stuff?
Some of it.

11:30.999 --> 11:32.999
Is that cute, Kim, for me
if I wanted to change?

11:32.999 --> 11:34.999
You're freaking me
out.

11:34.999 --> 11:36.999
Yeah, well, I mean, I'd
have to still see it on.

11:36.999 --> 11:38.999
All right, let me try
that on.

11:38.999 --> 11:40.999
My mom loves a theme, so
we wanted the party to be, you

11:40.999 --> 11:43.999
know, uh, some kind of dress-up
party.

11:43.999 --> 11:45.999
This is for the
after-- older Kris is going

11:45.999 --> 11:47.999
- younger.
- I really like it,

11:47.999 --> 11:49.999
- actually.
- I set up this dress

11:49.999 --> 11:51.999
fitting.
We just want her to have a good

11:51.999 --> 11:53.999
time and not worry about any
of this.

11:53.999 --> 11:56.999
I had her get this,
'cause I saw it in the catalog,

11:56.999 --> 11:59.999
- but I think...
- Oh,  stop!

11:59.999 --> 12:02.999
No, you're in a carwash.

12:02.999 --> 12:04.999
- Yes!
- Oh, my God!

12:04.999 --> 12:06.999
- Carwash!
- That is the Kris

12:06.999 --> 12:08.999
- Jenner.
- Yeah, and it comes in

12:08.999 --> 12:10.999
- black if you like it that much.
- Oh, my God!

12:10.999 --> 12:13.999
- We need another performer.
- I know.

12:13.999 --> 12:15.999
You guys cannot
just have one person.

12:15.999 --> 12:17.999
That's what Kanye keeps
saying, but who?

12:17.999 --> 12:19.999
- Him in a minute.
- Miguel?

12:19.999 --> 12:21.999
No, I think Kanye's
gonna have to step in and do it.

12:21.999 --> 12:23.999
- No.
- He has to do

12:23.999 --> 12:25.999
- something.
- Okay, here's the white,

12:25.999 --> 12:26.999
but I don't have--
It's gorgeous.

12:26.999 --> 12:28.999
I don't have
a Spanx on.

12:28.999 --> 12:30.999
- This is it.
- So then I would--

12:30.999 --> 12:32.999
- This is it.
Mm-hmm.

12:32.999 --> 12:35.000
- I love this.
- These shoes are

12:35.000 --> 12:37.999
actually comfortable, but the
other ones are sexier, so I'll

12:37.999 --> 12:40.999
wear the other ones.
It makes me feel really special

12:40.999 --> 12:43.999
that they're so excited about
the party and they want every

12:43.999 --> 12:47.999
detail to be perfect, including
my outfit.

12:47.999 --> 12:50.999
I can't wait for
the fitting for the 70th party.

12:50.999 --> 12:53.999
That fitting is gonna be
special.

12:57.000 --> 13:08.999
You son of a bitch!âª âª

13:08.999 --> 13:10.999
Yay!
Oh, my God.

13:10.999 --> 13:14.999
- Are you pregnant?
- Happy birthday!

13:14.999 --> 13:17.999
There's so many birthdays going
on, and we've been so busy

13:17.999 --> 13:21.999
planning my mom's party, so I'm
just really happy that we can

13:21.999 --> 13:24.999
pull off having a family lunch
with Caitlyn and being able to

13:24.999 --> 13:27.999
give her gifts and really enjoy
the moment.

13:27.999 --> 13:29.999
Well, doesn't
everybody look nice.

13:29.999 --> 13:31.999
- I love that.
- Thanks.

13:31.999 --> 13:34.999
- 66.
- Wow, you're almost 70.

13:34.999 --> 13:38.999
I'm traveling across
the United States in a bus.

13:38.999 --> 13:42.999
Kind of "Trans in America."
First, I get to go back to New

13:42.999 --> 13:44.999
- Glamour.
- That's exciting.

13:44.999 --> 13:47.999
And you should go to the
Victoria's Secret show.

13:47.999 --> 13:49.999
Kendall's walking, but it's a
huge surprise and it's a really

13:49.999 --> 13:51.999
- big deal.
- She's walking in

13:51.999 --> 13:53.999
- Victoria's Secret?
- It's a secret.

13:53.999 --> 13:55.999
- It's a surprise.
- But you should go.

13:55.999 --> 13:57.999
This is, like, the one fashion
show--

13:57.999 --> 13:59.999
Oh, I should go.
You're absolutely right.

13:59.999 --> 14:01.999
You and Kylie should go
together.

14:01.999 --> 14:03.999
- Don't say anything.
- Do not say

14:03.999 --> 14:05.999
- anything.
- How cool is that?

14:05.999 --> 14:07.999
Kendall always said that's,
like, her fantasy job.

14:07.999 --> 14:10.000
- It is.
- God, I'm so proud of

14:10.000 --> 14:12.999
- her.
- Mm, do you want a

14:12.999 --> 14:14.999
- birthday gift?
- Ooh, birthday gift?

14:14.999 --> 14:16.999
- Let's do it.
- Do we have them?

14:16.999 --> 14:18.999
This is just
from me.

14:18.999 --> 14:21.999
Okay.
Look at that bag.

14:21.999 --> 14:23.999
- Cute.
- Isn't that nice?

14:23.999 --> 14:26.999
You said you needed a
brown bag.

14:26.999 --> 14:29.999
Very nice.
Thank you.

14:29.999 --> 14:34.999
Finally, the perfect birthday
gifts.

14:34.999 --> 14:36.999
- I know.
- After all of these

14:36.999 --> 14:39.999
- years.
- Dad, tell us how you

14:39.999 --> 14:43.999
- feel to turn 66.
- But I'm just one

14:43.999 --> 14:46.999
- year old.
- You're one years old?

14:46.999 --> 14:48.999
I'm one year old.
Yeah.

14:48.999 --> 14:52.999
My first real birthday, um, I
feel absolutely wonderful.

14:52.999 --> 14:54.999
I'm just very excited about the
future.

14:54.999 --> 14:57.999
- Yeah.
- Cute. Love you.

14:57.999 --> 15:07.999
Love you.âª âª

15:07.999 --> 15:10.999
I think the sleeve
length is good, right?

15:10.999 --> 15:12.999
Let me see.
Even want to show a little bit

15:12.999 --> 15:14.999
- more, uh, sleeves.
- With the white?

15:14.999 --> 15:18.999
Yeah. So we can make
it, like, half-inch shorter.

15:18.999 --> 15:20.999
- Hey.
- Wow, this is so

15:20.999 --> 15:22.999
different than when I was here.
It was not... There-there was,

15:22.999 --> 15:24.999
like, nothing.
It was all empty.

15:24.999 --> 15:26.999
This is so good.
I love this.

15:26.999 --> 15:29.000
- Is this '20s though?
- This is.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.999
- I don't know what kind of shoes.
- Yeah. I like that

15:32.999 --> 15:35.999
- better.
- For my mom's party,

15:35.999 --> 15:38.999
everyone's going all out with
these, like, jeweled gowns.

15:38.999 --> 15:40.999
And sometimes I'm just not a
dress girl.

15:40.999 --> 15:44.999
I took my inspiration from a
Helmut Newton photograph, and

15:44.999 --> 15:49.999
I'm going to wear, like, a Saint
Laurent men's suit and be, like,

15:49.999 --> 15:53.999
- for the night.
- How was it, when you

15:53.999 --> 15:55.999
- went to go see Scott?
- Um, it was good.

15:55.999 --> 15:57.999
- Yeah?
- I was happy to go.

15:57.999 --> 16:00.999
- Yeah, I'm glad you went.
- I have been going

16:00.999 --> 16:04.999
to visit Scott in rehab.
And I know nothing's gonna

16:04.999 --> 16:07.999
change overnight, but I'm really
proud of him for taking this

16:07.999 --> 16:11.999
step.
And, you know, I'm here to

16:11.999 --> 16:14.999
support him in any way that I
can.

16:14.999 --> 16:17.999
He kept saying, "Thank you for
coming."

16:17.999 --> 16:19.999
- Well, that was nice.
- It was good.

16:19.999 --> 16:22.999
I'm glad I went and didn't wait,
'cause Mom was like, "You got to

16:22.999 --> 16:25.999
live in the moment..."
Mm-hmm.

16:25.999 --> 16:28.999
"...and go."
And who knows what next week

16:28.999 --> 16:32.999
- will bring?
- Yeah.

16:32.999 --> 16:34.999
So, it was good.

16:48.999 --> 16:50.999
Hi. I love your
jacket.

16:50.999 --> 16:54.000
Thanks. How did
everything, uh... work out?

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
- Oh. I mean, fine...
- Are you back?

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
- Do you go back?
- Yeah. I've been all

16:58.000 --> 17:00.999
weekend.
I'm going before the party.

17:00.999 --> 17:02.999
I'll be there for a few hours
today.

17:02.999 --> 17:05.999
I'm just... It's the most
draining thing of life.

17:05.999 --> 17:09.999
Every time I leave the hospital,
I get super anxious.

17:09.999 --> 17:11.999
I don't know. It's just my heart
wants to be there.

17:11.999 --> 17:14.999
I am the power of attorney.
I'm making all of his medical

17:14.999 --> 17:18.999
decisions, and I just want Lamar
to know that he has a support

17:18.999 --> 17:20.999
- system.
- Give us 15 minutes.

17:20.999 --> 17:22.999
- We'll get it perfect.
- Okay.

17:22.999 --> 17:24.999
I got to call Mom,
so don't talk.

17:24.999 --> 17:27.999
Mom.

17:27.999 --> 17:29.999
How did you get Mom
out of the house?

17:29.999 --> 17:31.999
- Corey.
- What did he say?

17:31.999 --> 17:33.999
I don't know. He... They
never came home last night.

17:33.999 --> 17:36.999
- Shh! It's Mom.
- What time is she

17:36.999 --> 17:38.999
- coming home?
- What are you doing

17:38.999 --> 17:41.999
- right now?
- I'm with Corey.

17:41.999 --> 17:43.999
- That's fun.
- And then I have to race

17:43.999 --> 17:45.999
home and shower and then go
to Kim's.

17:45.999 --> 17:48.999
We want to keep this
video an amazing surprise.

17:48.999 --> 17:53.999
We have to shoot so much
footage, so we got to try to get

17:53.999 --> 17:55.999
this  together.
Okay, well, I'll see you at

17:55.999 --> 17:57.999
Kendall's birthday party
tonight...

17:57.999 --> 17:58.999
- Um, okay.
- ...'cause I'm gonna go

17:58.999 --> 18:00.999
by the hospital for a few and
then I'll just meet you guys at

18:00.999 --> 18:02.999
- Kendall's.
- Okay, I love you.

18:02.999 --> 18:05.999
Okay, I love you, too.
Bye.

18:05.999 --> 18:07.999
Let's eat our
salads, then, while we're

18:07.999 --> 18:08.999
- waiting.
- Okay.

18:08.999 --> 18:11.999
Guys, I will no longer be a
teenager, as of 11 hours from

18:11.999 --> 18:14.999
- now.
- That's insane.

18:14.999 --> 18:15.999
I'm the one who told
you that.

18:15.999 --> 18:17.999
Yesterday, Lamar was
so aware.

18:17.999 --> 18:19.999
Like, even when he saw you and
he, like, laughed...

18:19.999 --> 18:21.999
I was going to say,
how different is he from the

18:21.999 --> 18:22.999
- last time I saw him?
- Yeah, so, like, I have

18:22.999 --> 18:24.999
- to...
- Is he going to fully

18:24.999 --> 18:25.999
- recover? Like, to be able...
Mm-hmm.

18:25.999 --> 18:26.999
- Okay.
- I think so.

18:26.999 --> 18:29.999
Well, they can't promise me, but
he has nine  lives, that

18:29.999 --> 18:32.999
- kid.
- What do we have to

18:32.999 --> 18:33.999
- do now?
- We first have a group

18:33.999 --> 18:35.999
- shot in the car...
- Oh, right.

18:35.999 --> 18:37.999
...and then we have to
do solos on the treadmill.

18:37.999 --> 18:41.999
- Okay.
- I have to do a phoner.

18:41.999 --> 18:45.999
- See you guys later.
- That's our only

18:45.999 --> 18:47.999
- group shot, right?
- We have one hour left

18:47.999 --> 18:52.999
to get everything done and we
have to jam through everything--

18:52.999 --> 18:54.999
like, every minute of this hour
is used.

18:54.999 --> 18:57.999
It's fine, we can
still do our... yes.

18:57.999 --> 19:00.999
- But we can still do our solos.
- My sisters and I are

19:00.999 --> 19:04.999
going to do our individual
treadmill shots until Kylie's

19:04.999 --> 19:07.999
- ready to get her butt out here.
- Let's start off

19:07.999 --> 19:09.999
- with the workout.
- All right, start

19:09.999 --> 19:11.999
- rolling.
- Okay.

19:11.999 --> 19:20.999
And... action.âª âª

19:20.999 --> 19:23.999
I was so excited when
we came up with this idea, so as

19:23.999 --> 19:28.999
anxious as I get leaving the
hospital, I need to make that

19:28.999 --> 19:31.999
first step and be there for my
mom, too.

19:31.999 --> 19:33.999
I'm gonna do everything in my
power to just have the best

19:33.999 --> 19:35.999
time.âª âª

19:35.999 --> 19:37.999
- There's 20 left.
- Kylie, Mom's gonna

19:37.999 --> 19:40.999
be home in 20 minutes!
We have to do this!

19:40.999 --> 19:43.999
Okay, let's go.

19:43.999 --> 19:45.999
- Where's Kylie? Wait, hold on.
- Who cares?

19:45.999 --> 19:48.999
I don't want a
closeup.

19:48.999 --> 19:50.999
Guys, we gotta film
this.

19:50.999 --> 19:52.999
You guys, once this is
done, this is gonna be the most

19:52.999 --> 19:54.999
- epic thing.
- It's gonna be so

19:54.999 --> 19:56.999
- good.
- So you guys, everyone,

19:56.999 --> 19:57.999
- put some pep in your step.
- I agree.

19:57.999 --> 19:59.999
All right, you guys
ready?

19:59.999 --> 20:02.999
I'm gonna start rolling this.
Hot.

20:02.999 --> 20:05.999
awesome.
Such a good video.

20:05.999 --> 20:07.999
Come on, Kylie.

20:07.999 --> 20:09.999
You guys all look
really good.

20:09.999 --> 20:11.999
I look at Kylie and
she's just, like, not even

20:11.999 --> 20:13.999
singing.
All I'm asking Kylie to do is to

20:13.999 --> 20:16.999
give us an hour of her undivided
attention.

20:16.999 --> 20:18.999
All right, one
group car with the GoPro and

20:18.999 --> 20:20.999
- we're done.
- Do you want to

20:20.999 --> 20:22.999
- carpool tonight or no?
- Yeah.

20:22.999 --> 20:24.999
- Eh...
- We can have an

20:24.999 --> 20:26.999
extra car for the ride home,
in case we don't want to go back

20:26.999 --> 20:28.999
at the same time.
Which should we...

20:28.999 --> 20:30.999
- Is Tyga coming?
- I kind of want to

20:30.999 --> 20:33.999
disinvite him, just 'cause I
want to hang out.

20:33.999 --> 20:36.999
I just want to be, like, a
friend thing.

20:36.999 --> 20:38.999
Um... I don't
really think that's gonna go

20:38.999 --> 20:40.999
- over well.
Mm-hmm. Right, right.

20:40.999 --> 20:42.999
And 'cause I invited
him personally, so it's not like

20:42.999 --> 20:43.999
- you invited him.
- Who?

20:43.999 --> 20:45.999
- Tyga.
- You guys are fighting?

20:45.999 --> 20:47.999
- No, I'm just...
- Kendall, could you

20:47.999 --> 20:49.999
- step to your left, please.
- Over Tyga?

20:49.999 --> 20:52.999
Tonight, I am
celebrating my 20th birthday and

20:52.999 --> 20:56.999
I invited Tyga before Kylie and
Tyga had their issue.

20:56.999 --> 20:58.999
Kylie's always extremely vague
when there's stuff going on with

20:58.999 --> 21:00.999
Tyga.
She doesn't really open up, to

21:00.999 --> 21:02.999
me at least.
So I don't know.

21:02.999 --> 21:04.999
I guess we'll just see what
happens.

21:04.999 --> 21:06.999
I think you should experience
it.

21:06.999 --> 21:08.999
You always say, "I want to
experience things," but I don't

21:08.999 --> 21:10.999
think you actually want to
experience things, because you

21:10.999 --> 21:12.999
would experience it if you
wanted to experience things.

21:12.999 --> 21:14.999
I don't know what
you're talking about.

21:14.999 --> 21:16.999
Meaning you should
experience being single.

21:16.999 --> 21:18.999
Kylie, you're wearing
a different jacket.

21:18.999 --> 21:20.999
Kylie's wearing a different
jacket.

21:20.999 --> 21:23.999
Is it the black
one?

21:23.999 --> 21:24.999
Why aren't you taking
this seriously?

21:24.999 --> 21:26.999
Yeah, you're so
annoying.

21:26.999 --> 21:27.999
Because I'm having
issues.

21:27.999 --> 21:29.999
But it doesn't matter.
This is about somebody else.

21:29.999 --> 21:31.999
I'm gonna cry if we
don't...

21:31.999 --> 21:34.999
- What's wrong?
- Why are you crying?

21:34.999 --> 21:36.999
What are you crying about?

21:36.999 --> 21:38.999
I don't want to do
this.

21:38.999 --> 21:40.999
I thought she was
kidding, too.

21:40.999 --> 21:45.999
- Why is she crying?
- Kyles...

21:45.999 --> 21:46.999
- Did you get in a fight?
- I just, like, don't

21:46.999 --> 21:49.999
know what to do about T.

21:49.999 --> 21:52.999
Why were you mad that
Caitlyn wants to go to the show?

21:52.999 --> 21:54.999
- 'Cause Caitlyn's going.
- Because you opened your

21:54.999 --> 21:56.999
big mouth.

22:00.999 --> 22:02.999
Why aren't you taking
this seriously?

22:02.999 --> 22:04.999
I'll cry if we
don't...

22:04.999 --> 22:08.999
- What's wrong?
- Why are you crying?

22:08.999 --> 22:10.999
I don't want to do
this.

22:10.999 --> 22:12.999
I thought she was
kidding, too.

22:12.999 --> 22:16.999
Why is she crying?
Like, you think I want to be

22:16.999 --> 22:18.999
here?
It's your birthday tonight, your

22:18.999 --> 22:22.999
25 months pregnant...
I'd rather be in the hospital.

22:22.999 --> 22:24.999
I know, but
whatever she's going through...

22:24.999 --> 22:26.999
I understand that, but
I... we're all going through

22:26.999 --> 22:28.999
things, but let's tough it out
for the one hour to make Mom

22:28.999 --> 22:30.999
happy.
Or is that fine?

22:30.999 --> 22:32.999
Yeah, I'll go talk
to her.

22:32.999 --> 22:33.999
But, like, hur...
Mom's gonna be here any second.

22:33.999 --> 22:35.999
- Maybe we got it.
- I think we have to

22:35.999 --> 22:36.999
- be done.
- Do you know how many

22:36.999 --> 22:38.999
times I've been going through
something that I had to pull

22:38.999 --> 22:41.999
myself together for?
Like, that's just life.

22:41.999 --> 22:44.999
- Get your  together.
- Kyles?

22:44.999 --> 22:46.999
What happened?
Did you get in a fight?

22:46.999 --> 22:48.999
I just, like, don't
know what to do about T.

22:48.999 --> 22:50.999
It's just, like, he just called
me, and I'm just having issues

22:50.999 --> 22:51.999
- with him.
- Today?

22:51.999 --> 22:53.999
Like, just now.
But it's just weird and I don't

22:53.999 --> 22:56.999
know what to do, so...
Whatever, I'll figure it out.

22:56.999 --> 22:58.999
Well, so what do
you want to do?

22:58.999 --> 23:00.999
- I'm just gonna go.
- Why don't you...

23:00.999 --> 23:02.999
My makeup's ugly
anyway, I don't even want to be

23:02.999 --> 23:05.000
on camera.
I feel really, really bad that

23:05.000 --> 23:08.999
this is, like, the only day that
all of us can get together, but

23:08.999 --> 23:11.999
I'm just upset right now and I
don't know if I could finish it.

23:11.999 --> 23:14.999
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

23:14.999 --> 23:16.999
Okay, we're coming
over at 5:00.

23:16.999 --> 23:19.999
- Love you.
- What'd she say?

23:19.999 --> 23:21.999
She just said stuff
with T.

23:21.999 --> 23:23.999
We're just gonna
have to work with what we have.

23:23.999 --> 23:26.999
Um, all right, so
I'll see you at the party

23:26.999 --> 23:28.999
- tonight.
- Yeah.

23:28.999 --> 23:38.999
Okay.âª âª

23:38.999 --> 23:41.999
- There you guys are.
- Oh, hi.

23:41.999 --> 23:43.999
- Hi.
- Clear your

23:43.999 --> 23:45.999
schedule.
We're gonna be eating a lot.

23:45.999 --> 23:46.999
- But I'm getting better.
- I'm tempted to not eat

23:46.999 --> 23:48.999
that much.
I'm, like, roly-poly status at

23:48.999 --> 23:50.999
- this point.
- You're not roly-poly.

23:50.999 --> 23:52.999
- I am.
- She's much less

23:52.999 --> 23:54.999
roly-poly than last time.
- You're pregnant.

23:54.999 --> 23:55.999
- If you weren't roly-poly...
- No, my stomach is

23:55.999 --> 23:57.999
sticking out more and that just
freaks me out, like, more.

23:57.999 --> 23:59.999
Right, but last
time, you were like...

23:59.999 --> 24:01.999
Like, the whole thing...

24:01.999 --> 24:03.999
...was literally Jabba the
Hutted out.

24:03.999 --> 24:05.000
No, look at how big my
thighs are.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.999
Right, so, now,
double that and that was last

24:06.999 --> 24:08.999
time.
So, in case you forgot...

24:08.999 --> 24:10.999
- No.
- Yeah.

24:10.999 --> 24:12.999
Wait, tell me about The
Edition.

24:12.999 --> 24:13.999
- In New York?
Mm-hmm.

24:13.999 --> 24:14.999
- A hotel?
- Yeah, it's

24:14.999 --> 24:16.999
- beautiful, it's a clock tower.
- It's where...

24:16.999 --> 24:17.999
It's right on
Madison Square Park.

24:17.999 --> 24:18.999
I need to go there on
the ninth.

24:18.999 --> 24:20.999
- For the big show?
Mm-hmm.

24:20.999 --> 24:24.999
Why were you mad that
Caitlyn wants to go to the show?

24:24.999 --> 24:26.999
Because it's something
that...

24:26.999 --> 24:28.999
It's her dad and she
should go to something like

24:28.999 --> 24:30.999
- that.
- She doesn't want one

24:30.999 --> 24:32.999
- person there.
- But you can go.

24:32.999 --> 24:34.999
No, I'm gonna be
backstage with Kendall.

24:34.999 --> 24:36.999
It's something that we've worked
on from day one.

24:36.999 --> 24:37.999
So you're not gonna go
sit in the front?

24:37.999 --> 24:39.999
No.
She doesn't want anybody to sit

24:39.999 --> 24:41.999
- out in the front row.
- So tell her to tell

24:41.999 --> 24:43.999
- Caitlyn. 'Cause Caitlyn's going.
- Because you opened your

24:43.999 --> 24:46.999
big mouth when I said, "Please
don't say a word to anyone."

24:46.999 --> 24:48.999
I thought her dad should
know that she is fulfilling one

24:48.999 --> 24:50.999
- of her lifelong dreams.
- No, not until she's

24:50.999 --> 24:52.999
ready, that's why I'll never
tell you anything again like

24:52.999 --> 24:55.999
that.
She wants this to be about her.

24:55.999 --> 24:59.999
She doesn't want one of us to
take attention away.

24:59.999 --> 25:03.999
If Caitlyn goes and sits in the
audience of a televised

25:03.999 --> 25:09.999
show-- like, Oh, my God, Kendall
will kill herself.

25:09.999 --> 25:12.999
Look at this car!
Cheers, baby.

25:12.999 --> 25:16.999
Cheers and a beautiful
happy birthday.

25:16.999 --> 25:19.999
I know Kendall already
invited T.

25:19.999 --> 25:27.999
I just hope that we can make it
through the night without drama.

25:27.999 --> 25:29.999
If Caitlyn goes and
sits in the  audience of

25:29.999 --> 25:34.999
a televised show, like, oh, my
God, Kendall will kill herself.

25:34.999 --> 25:36.999
I knew that Kendall
walking in the Victoria's Secret

25:36.999 --> 25:40.999
show was a secret, but I didn't
think that meant I couldn't tell

25:40.999 --> 25:43.000
her own dad.
You know, I said something.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.999
Like, she just needs to slow
down.

25:45.999 --> 25:48.999
I feel like sometimes we hide
behind my mom and think, because

25:48.999 --> 25:52.999
she's our manager, she can just,
like, fix everything.

25:52.999 --> 25:57.999
Kendall needs to, like, man up
and tell her dad what she wants.

25:57.999 --> 25:59.999
So call Kendall.
Let's call Kendall.

25:59.999 --> 26:01.999
Okay.

26:01.999 --> 26:04.999
- Hi.
- Do you really not want

26:04.999 --> 26:06.999
Caitlyn to come to the
Victoria's Secret show?

26:06.999 --> 26:09.999
You guys, I want
everyone there, but I think it's

26:09.999 --> 26:12.999
- better that no one's there.
- Okay, so I think that

26:12.999 --> 26:15.999
your dad is so excited, 'cause
she just happens to be in New

26:15.999 --> 26:17.999
York, just call her and just
say...

26:17.999 --> 26:20.999
"I don't want you
there, please come to the after

26:20.999 --> 26:21.999
party and we'll all meet at the
after party."

26:21.999 --> 26:23.999
And just say, "I don't
want one family member there..."

26:23.999 --> 26:25.999
Guys, I'm getting
ready for my party tonight, can

26:25.999 --> 26:27.999
I worry about this in, like, two
days?

26:27.999 --> 26:29.999
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

26:29.999 --> 26:31.999
Kim needed to deal with
it now and call you.

26:31.999 --> 26:33.999
Mom's just mad that
Caitlyn has a ticket and she

26:33.999 --> 26:36.999
doesn't.
Exactly!

26:36.999 --> 26:38.999
Okay, bye.
Yeah, you'll call her yourself.

26:38.999 --> 26:47.999
Obviously I told the
wrong human being.

26:53.999 --> 26:55.999
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday!

26:55.999 --> 26:57.999
- Thank you.
- Happy birthday.

26:57.999 --> 27:00.999
- I love your outfit.
- Tonight's my

27:00.999 --> 27:02.999
birthday.
I feel like I have a really good

27:02.999 --> 27:07.999
room of people, everyone I love.

27:07.999 --> 27:09.999
- Is Kylie even coming?
- She's supposed to.

27:09.999 --> 27:11.999
I can't believe
she's late.

27:11.999 --> 27:13.999
I can't keep track of
her today.

27:13.999 --> 27:15.999
I really hope Kylie
ends up showing up, 'cause she

27:15.999 --> 27:17.999
was a little upset earlier,
which I'm a little bummed about,

27:17.999 --> 27:19.999
just 'cause I was excited to
hang out with her.

27:26.999 --> 27:28.999
Kylie, get in here.

27:28.999 --> 27:30.999
Kylie, what the.

27:30.999 --> 27:32.999
What the  is wrong with
you?

27:32.999 --> 27:34.999
I'm kind of distracted
today because all I can think

27:34.999 --> 27:38.999
about is Tyga.
I know Kendall already invited

27:38.999 --> 27:40.999
T.
I just hope that we can make it

27:40.999 --> 27:46.999
through the night without drama.

27:46.999 --> 27:48.999
It's my first time
having alcohol in four weeks.

27:48.999 --> 27:50.999
I am ready to get this party
started.

27:50.999 --> 27:52.999
Kris  Jenner, you're
about to get your panties moist,

27:52.999 --> 27:55.999
- girl.
- Did you have your

27:55.999 --> 27:57.999
publicist announce that you are
going?

27:57.999 --> 27:59.999
- No! You can't!
- You can come to the

27:59.999 --> 28:01.999
after party!

28:05.999 --> 28:08.999
Kylie and Tyga broke

28:08.999 --> 28:12.999
up or got into a fight.
I have no idea why.

28:12.999 --> 28:15.999
It's definitely awkward to have
Kylie and Tyga both here, and

28:15.999 --> 28:19.999
we're all just, like, watching.
Kendall Nicole Jenner.

28:19.999 --> 28:22.999
Happy birthday, baby girl.

28:22.999 --> 28:25.999
We all love you.
And enjoy your life.

28:37.999 --> 28:44.999
Kylie, come on.

28:44.999 --> 28:46.999
Totally knew they'd
be fine when they saw each

28:46.999 --> 28:48.999
other.
I totally knew they'd get back

28:48.999 --> 28:52.999
together.
That's just what happens.

28:52.999 --> 29:07.999
It is what it is.

29:07.999 --> 29:11.999
Hey, babe, where...?
What kind of cups do you want?

29:11.999 --> 29:13.999
Do you want glasses, or do you
want to get cups?

29:13.999 --> 29:15.999
Yeah, I think we have
to drink champagne out of a

29:15.999 --> 29:20.999
crystal glass.
Tonight is the big night, and

29:20.999 --> 29:25.999
I'm really, really excited.
I literally don't know one thing

29:25.999 --> 29:29.999
about this party, except for
what I was supposed to wear.

29:29.999 --> 29:31.999
That's it.
Is it hot in here, or am I

29:31.999 --> 29:33.999
- having a hot flash?
- Yeah.

29:33.999 --> 29:35.999
I'm gonna go put my

29:35.999 --> 29:37.999
dress on and see what's going
on.

29:37.999 --> 29:39.999
- All right.
- Oh, wait.

29:39.999 --> 29:40.999
- My dress has to go over my head.
- Oh, God.

29:40.999 --> 29:42.999
Well, let's stop.
Just give me...

29:42.999 --> 29:44.999
Just kidding.
Just kidding.

29:44.999 --> 29:46.999
Oh.

29:46.999 --> 29:48.999
Um...

29:52.999 --> 29:55.999
You know in these
times, it was illegal to have

29:55.999 --> 29:58.999
alcohol, so, like, that's why
had, like,

29:58.999 --> 30:00.999
- these parties.
- Yeah. Oh.

30:00.999 --> 30:02.999
'Cause he was so rich,
and you were able to.

30:02.999 --> 30:04.999
- Yeah, that's cool.
- Did they have lip

30:04.999 --> 30:06.999
- injections back then?
- They didn't have

30:06.999 --> 30:10.999
alcohol, Kylie.

30:10.999 --> 30:13.999
- Hello.
- Hey, Dad.

30:13.999 --> 30:16.999
Just kidding.
Um... like, what time are you

30:16.999 --> 30:20.999
and Kris planning on leaving?
I think about 6:30.

30:20.999 --> 30:22.999
What?!
No, you're supposed to leave at,

30:22.999 --> 30:25.000
like, 8:00.
You cannot leave a second before

30:25.000 --> 30:28.999
8:00.
She cannot get to this party

30:28.999 --> 30:31.999
before her guests get there.
My mom needs to make an

30:31.999 --> 30:33.999
entrance, and we planned it
perfectly.

30:33.999 --> 30:36.999
I want to see her face.
I want to see the reaction.

30:36.999 --> 30:38.999
- Thank God I called you.
- Got you.

30:38.999 --> 30:45.999
Bye.

30:45.999 --> 30:48.999
Hi, Dad.
I'm very mad at you about

30:48.999 --> 30:50.999
something, so...
Did you publicly...?

30:50.999 --> 30:52.999
Like, did you have your
publicist announce that you were

30:52.999 --> 30:54.999
going?
Because I don't know how

30:54.999 --> 30:56.999
everyone knows, and now it's a
huge story, and I'm actually

30:56.999 --> 30:59.999
pissed at you.
Okay, well, then, you knew that

30:59.999 --> 31:01.999
was gonna happen, and I...
That's so annoying.

31:01.999 --> 31:03.999
Okay, well, then, I don't want
you to go.

31:03.999 --> 31:06.999
A lot of people assume that I
get jobs from my family, but

31:06.999 --> 31:08.999
it's actually kind of the
opposite.

31:08.999 --> 31:11.999
It made me have to work even
harder to get what I wanted, so,

31:11.999 --> 31:15.999
I get scared that if my dad
goes, that's kind of a media

31:15.999 --> 31:17.999
frenzy, and now it's kind of all
blowing up.

31:17.999 --> 31:19.999
You're gonna be... take the
biggest night of my life, and

31:19.999 --> 31:22.999
take it away from me?!
Thank you.

31:22.999 --> 31:24.999
- No, you can't!
- You can come to the

31:24.999 --> 31:29.999
after party.
You can't come.

31:29.999 --> 31:31.999
- Did Kim leave yet?
- Is she at Mom's, also?

31:31.999 --> 31:33.999
Yeah, but she was
supposed to leave for sure.

31:33.999 --> 31:35.999
Getting your dress sewn
right on you.

31:35.999 --> 31:37.999
And we're all running so late.

31:42.999 --> 31:44.999
You're gonna be...
take the biggest night of my

31:44.999 --> 31:47.999
life and take it away from me?!
Thank you.

31:47.999 --> 31:49.999
- No, you can't!
- You can come to the

31:49.999 --> 31:52.999
after party.
You can't come.

31:52.999 --> 31:55.999
I hope you're not doing this for
your own good-ass attention.

31:55.999 --> 31:59.000
You're welcome to come if you
don't  say anything, and

31:59.000 --> 32:02.999
you walk in the back door.
It's just beyond annoying.

32:02.999 --> 32:04.999
I asked everyone not to come,
and of course, you're begging me

32:04.999 --> 32:06.999
to come, making me feel like.

32:06.999 --> 32:10.999
You know I'm a pushover, so you
know I'm gonna...

32:10.999 --> 32:13.999
- I understand!
- There's a million  shows.

32:13.999 --> 32:17.999
Uh-oh. Uh-oh.
Kendall is pissed.

32:17.999 --> 32:19.999
I've already been
disinvited, so I'm just staying

32:19.999 --> 32:21.999
- out of it.
- We've all been

32:21.999 --> 32:23.999
disinvited.
It's her thing.

32:23.999 --> 32:26.999
Yeah, so, then, why
would she even let her go?

32:26.999 --> 32:29.999
- I don't think she did.
- You know what?

32:29.999 --> 32:31.999
Love you.
I'm not trying to have this

32:31.999 --> 32:34.999
argument. Bye.

32:37.999 --> 32:39.999
- You okay, Ken?
- It's just so

32:39.999 --> 32:41.999
annoying.
Literally begged me to go,

32:41.999 --> 32:43.999
'cause originally, I was saying,
"No, you can't go.

32:43.999 --> 32:45.999
I'm not letting anyone go."
And she was like, "You have to

32:45.999 --> 32:47.999
let me go!
No one will care about me."

32:47.999 --> 32:49.999
Duh, duh, duh, duh.
I'm like, "Yeah, you say that,

32:49.999 --> 32:51.999
'cause you're so used to being
Bruce."

32:51.999 --> 32:53.999
Like, no one would have cared
about Bruce being there.

32:53.999 --> 32:54.999
Everyone's now gonna care that
Caitlyn's there.

32:54.999 --> 32:56.999
- Right.
- Like, there's a huge

32:56.999 --> 32:58.999
- difference.
- All of us aren't going

32:58.999 --> 33:00.999
- anymore.
- That's what I said!

33:00.999 --> 33:09.999
Right.âª âª

33:09.999 --> 33:11.999
- Hi!
- Hi.

33:11.999 --> 33:13.999
You are so cute.
First one to wear a suit.

33:13.999 --> 33:15.999
- Wait. I can't wait.
- Hi, guys.

33:15.999 --> 33:23.999
- Can you be my date tonight?
- Yes, of course.

33:23.999 --> 33:30.999
- Thank you.
- This cigar stinks.

33:30.999 --> 33:32.999
I thought you wanted
it.

33:32.999 --> 33:34.999
- It smells, though.
- Well, that's how

33:34.999 --> 33:37.999
- cigars smell.
- Smell it.

33:37.999 --> 33:40.999
- Smells like ass, right?
- It smells.

33:40.999 --> 33:43.999
- Can I smell it?
- Oh, my God.

33:43.999 --> 33:45.999
- Oh!
- Yeah, that's...

33:45.999 --> 33:47.999
- I don't know what that is.
- Is that your cigar?

33:47.999 --> 33:49.999
- Yeah.
- Where did you play

33:49.999 --> 33:51.999
- with that?
- It was up my.

33:51.999 --> 33:54.999
- You're welcome, T.
- Someone mentions...

33:54.999 --> 33:56.999
- How cute is Lamar?
- And you have to

33:56.999 --> 33:58.999
- make a wish.
- Look.

33:58.999 --> 34:02.999
Yup, we're good.

34:02.999 --> 34:05.999
It's hard, it's tough,
but I just can't worry about

34:05.999 --> 34:07.999
Lamar tonight.
I can't be stressed about the

34:07.999 --> 34:09.999
hospital.
I have been looking forward to

34:09.999 --> 34:13.999
tonight because I haven't really
been out in public.

34:13.999 --> 34:17.999
It's just, I need an escape at
the same time.

34:17.999 --> 34:21.999
And it's all about my mom.
I want to focus on her and just

34:21.999 --> 34:23.999
enjoy tonight.
Did Kim leave yet?

34:23.999 --> 34:26.999
- Is that...?
- Is she at Mom's, also?

34:26.999 --> 34:34.999
Yeah, but she was
supposed to leave for sure.

34:34.999 --> 34:36.999
Getting your dress sewn
right on you.

34:36.999 --> 34:40.999
It looks good.
Looks like Chanel.

34:40.999 --> 34:43.999
Don't we need to leave?
Come on!

34:43.999 --> 34:47.999
Kim's being sewn into her dress,
and I'm ready to go, so I'm

34:47.999 --> 34:50.999
getting really anxious.
The clock is ticking.

34:50.999 --> 34:54.999
I do not want to be late for my
own party.

34:54.999 --> 34:56.999
- I'm all set.
- We're all running so

34:56.999 --> 35:06.999
- late.
- I'm ready.

35:06.999 --> 35:11.999
- Oh, my God.
- Oh,.

35:11.999 --> 35:18.999
Oh, my God!

35:26.999 --> 35:28.999
This party is just
incredible.

35:28.999 --> 35:31.999
Like, everybody is enjoying
themselves.

35:31.999 --> 35:33.999
Everybody came decked out.
It just came together so

35:33.999 --> 35:38.999
perfectly.
Hi. It looks so good so far.

35:38.999 --> 35:41.999
- You look so nice.
- So excited.

35:41.999 --> 35:43.999
- This looks insane.
- I'm ready to get this

35:43.999 --> 35:46.999
party started.
Mom, you're about to have the

35:46.999 --> 35:48.999
time of your life.

35:54.999 --> 36:02.999
Bye, darling.
Not bad for an old broad.

36:02.999 --> 36:06.999
Kim left, so I can finally go to
this party.

36:06.999 --> 36:10.999
I'm really excited to see what
the kids have done.

36:10.999 --> 36:13.999
Okay.
Look at this car!

36:13.999 --> 36:17.999
Oh!

36:17.999 --> 36:21.000
- Cheers, baby.
- Cheers and a beautiful

36:21.000 --> 36:23.999
- happy birthday.
- Thank you.

36:23.999 --> 36:26.999
- Look like you're 30.
- I'm not old in spirit

36:26.999 --> 36:31.999
or heart.
I'm just old in my body.

36:31.999 --> 36:38.999
That body is not old.

36:44.999 --> 36:46.999
I'm so happy you're
here.

36:46.999 --> 36:48.999
My mom's gonna die when she sees
you.

36:48.999 --> 36:51.999
Kanye's, like, been so busy
between fashion shows and his

36:51.999 --> 36:53.999
music.
So, you know, I'm really glad

36:53.999 --> 36:56.999
that he was able to make it to
the party.

36:56.999 --> 36:59.999
Yeah, bitches!
Kim, your dress is maje.

36:59.999 --> 37:05.999
Kanye, velvet suit?
guys!

37:05.999 --> 37:08.999
How's everything?

37:08.999 --> 37:10.999
- Is it better?
- So much better.

37:10.999 --> 37:15.999
He's off of all machines.
He's doing better. Thank God.

37:15.999 --> 37:19.999
He's improving little by little,
and that's all that matters.

37:19.999 --> 37:21.999
- It's been a lot.
- Of course it is.

37:21.999 --> 37:23.999
And I'm... It's my
first time having alcohol in

37:23.999 --> 37:25.999
four weeks.
I mean, it's gonna be...

37:25.999 --> 37:27.999
- Enjoy it.
- Oh.

37:27.999 --> 37:32.999
I have only been here for about
30 minutes, and I have probably

37:32.999 --> 37:35.999
been asked about Lamar 40 times.
And with every person who asks

37:35.999 --> 37:38.999
me about Lamar, I feel like I
need a glass of champagne.

37:38.999 --> 37:42.999
So...
I need another drink already.

37:42.999 --> 37:51.999
Oh. Thank God.âª âª

37:51.999 --> 37:55.999
- This is crazy.
- Our mom is here!

37:55.999 --> 37:59.999
- All of our moms are here!
- Hi, guys.

37:59.999 --> 38:04.999
This looks so good.
Oh, wow.

38:04.999 --> 38:09.999
- Happy birthday!
- Incredible!

38:09.999 --> 38:16.999
Oh, my God!âª âª

38:16.999 --> 38:18.999
This is crazy!
The Great

38:18.999 --> 38:23.999
Gatsby!âª âª

38:23.999 --> 38:26.999
This is the coolest
thing I've ever seen!

38:26.999 --> 38:29.999
You can tell that my
mom is super impressed.

38:29.999 --> 38:32.999
I think that we got the vision
really right.

38:32.999 --> 38:35.999
It has got to be the
most beautiful thing I've ever

38:35.999 --> 38:37.999
seen.
It was amazing.

38:37.999 --> 38:40.999
- I'm going to cry.
- I think my mom was

38:40.999 --> 38:43.999
just shocked and having the best
time.

38:43.999 --> 38:45.999
You know, she deserves it, so
I'm excited.

38:45.999 --> 38:49.999
I cannot wait till
she sees her video.

38:49.999 --> 38:52.999
All right, guys, we've
been practicing this routine for

38:52.999 --> 38:54.999
- a long time.
- Oh, God!

38:54.999 --> 38:56.999
I'm ready.
We're just kidding.

38:56.999 --> 39:00.999
We're not about to perform.
But we kind of wanted to

39:00.999 --> 39:03.999
embarrass her a little bit and
show you guys a video of what my

39:03.999 --> 39:08.999
mom did 30 years ago.
Hit it.

39:12.999 --> 39:16.999
30 years ago, I made a
music video, because that was my

39:16.999 --> 39:19.999
fantasy when I turned 30 years
old.

39:19.999 --> 39:24.999
And... of course, my girls have
to show it at my 60th birthday

39:24.999 --> 39:29.999
party.
Just to totally embarrass me.

39:29.999 --> 39:35.999
I love you guys!

39:39.999 --> 39:42.999
Remix!âª âª

39:55.999 --> 40:03.999
This is so cute and
creative and amazing and funny.

40:03.999 --> 40:08.999
She loves you.

40:08.999 --> 40:12.999
The fact that they took
the time and the thought that

40:12.999 --> 40:17.999
- went into that, oh, my God.
- She loves us!

40:17.999 --> 40:24.999
She loves you guys!

40:24.999 --> 40:26.999
You should've seen
your face.

40:26.999 --> 40:28.999
My mom looked so
happy.

40:28.999 --> 40:31.999
- Like, ridiculously happy.
- I'm shocked that we

40:31.999 --> 40:35.999
even pulled it off.
'Cause we did it so last second.

40:35.999 --> 40:37.999
My mom deserves it,
'cause she is the head of our

40:37.999 --> 40:41.999
family.
I'm so grateful and thankful

40:41.999 --> 40:44.999
that she is such a big part of
our lives.

40:57.999 --> 41:00.999
- Kris Jenner!
- Kris  Jenner!

41:00.999 --> 41:03.000
Bring your 60-year-old ass over
here.

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
Oh, stop cussing?
I'm sorry, Smelly.

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
I just want to thank
you guys.

41:07.000 --> 41:10.999
Honestly, this is a dream.
My girls and my son are

41:10.999 --> 41:16.999
remarkable and stunning and
amazing and...

41:16.999 --> 41:19.999
- Don't cut me off.
- Wait, wait, wait.

41:19.999 --> 41:23.999
Where's Charlie Wilson?
Charlie!

41:23.999 --> 41:25.999
Charlie?
No, I'm serious. Uncle Charlie!

41:25.999 --> 41:29.999
- Uncle Charlie in the red suit!
-  yes. Uncle Charlie.

41:29.999 --> 41:31.999
I was in the middle of
my speech!

41:31.999 --> 41:33.999
No. Shut the
up.

41:33.999 --> 41:35.999
- Uncle Charlie, come here.
- I love you guys!

41:35.999 --> 41:37.999
Khloe, you're the!

41:37.999 --> 41:39.999
Hold on, Kourtney!
What?

41:39.999 --> 41:42.999
Khloe is the!

41:42.999 --> 41:44.999
- Yeah!
- Thank God Khloe

41:44.999 --> 41:49.999
cuts off my mom's speech, which
was a really good move because I

41:49.999 --> 41:52.000
- was getting bored of it.
- Oh, you're about to

41:52.000 --> 41:55.999
get your panties moist, girl.

41:55.999 --> 41:57.999
60 and your panties
still get moist.

41:57.999 --> 42:00.999
- Let's go, girl!
- Oh, my God.

42:00.999 --> 42:03.999
I feel a little bad for my mom,
but you can never, like,

42:03.999 --> 42:07.999
- underestimate Khloe.
- Wait, Kim, why were

42:07.999 --> 42:10.999
you yelling at me when I wanted
the Godfather of  Soul?

42:10.999 --> 42:12.999
- What?
- What?

42:12.999 --> 42:14.999
I was just saying.
You cut off Mom's speech.

42:14.999 --> 42:17.999
- Mom's speech!
-  Mom's speech and

42:17.999 --> 42:19.999
- Kim K.'s speech.
- Wait, can I just

42:19.999 --> 42:22.999
- finish...
- No. Charlie Wilson!

42:22.999 --> 42:25.999
I was so happy to
see Khloe just, like, having the

42:25.999 --> 42:29.999
best time and in her element.
The old Khloe was back.

42:29.999 --> 42:31.999
She deserves to have a fun
night.

42:31.999 --> 42:35.999
Charlie Wilson and
Kanye West, everybody!

42:35.999 --> 42:40.999
âª Hey, we love you
Say, "Kris, hey, we love you"

42:40.999 --> 42:42.999
âª Everybody in the house say,
"Kris, we love you" âª

42:42.999 --> 42:50.999
âª Kris, we love you âªâª âª

42:50.999 --> 42:53.999
I love you!
I have to be up at 4:00 a.m.

42:53.999 --> 42:56.999
This is for sure the most iconic
party that we've ever thrown.

42:56.999 --> 42:59.999
Tonight was so much fun, and
usually I would stay longer, but

42:59.999 --> 43:01.999
I have to get to the Victoria's
Secret show.

43:01.999 --> 43:04.999
I just want to, like, do my job
and be good at it, so I'm gonna

43:04.999 --> 43:07.999
- get home to get some rest.
- Celebrating something

43:07.999 --> 43:12.999
like this is a way to remind
myself how wonderful life can

43:12.999 --> 43:17.999
really be.

43:17.999 --> 43:19.999
Let's do this.
Keeping Up with

43:19.999 --> 43:21.999
- the Kardashians...
- Whoa!

43:21.999 --> 43:23.999
I hear that you got
banned from the show.

43:23.999 --> 43:25.999
Everyone thinks I'm
the jealous sister.

43:25.999 --> 43:28.999
I can't live in my mom's
house anymore.

43:28.999 --> 43:30.999
I just want to be in my home
when I have the baby.

43:30.999 --> 43:32.999
- I'm trying not to freak out.
- How is she gonna go

43:32.999 --> 43:34.999
back to, like, married life?
Do you think she's, like, cured

43:34.999 --> 43:36.999
- already?
- I feel like she's

43:36.999 --> 43:38.999
- always like that.
- Scotty, oh, my God!

43:38.999 --> 43:40.999
- I'm back!
- Hey, Scott.

43:40.999 --> 43:44.999
I don't want to end up in the
same situation.

43:44.999 --> 43:47.999
