07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
Can you go off the chain a little bit every now and then?

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
You sometimes have to if things, you know --

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
Like, it's live, right? So there's sometimes

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
things like a cue card's not there

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
or the light's not on to see the cue cards,

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
and you're kind of suddenly

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
trying to figure out what's going on.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
That's interesting, 'cause all the viewers think it's you.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
-Yes. -Yeah.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
Yeah, all mistakes

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
are definitely on the person that's out there.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
They're not like, "I bet the writer messed up."

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000

"You see how bad your brother messed up yesterday?"

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
Have you had anybody on your cast

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
that's a big practical joker?

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
Yeah, like, Andy used to really prank me.

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
He would turn off all the lights in the bathroom

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
while I was in there and then hide, like, under a stall

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
and jump out, or hide in the hallway.

08:39.000 --> 08:43.000
And I knew it was coming, but I'm so easily scared,

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
that I knew it was coming, and I would just scream,

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
like a full banshee, and so genuinely scared.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
-I know someone like that. -It was such a simple task.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000

Hey, guys. Big fan of the show.

that Casey Jost appears in a lot of your episodes.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
Is it true that he's related

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000

If I have to say lines, then people tell me I'm no good.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000

No, but sometimes we have to buckle down.

Like, if we say, like, "Oh, you're a dentist."

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
-You kind of got to buckle down. -Yeah.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Because if there's no believability or credibility at all,

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
then we really don't have anywhere to work from --

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
Actually, when Casey writes

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
some of these presentations we give,

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
we always make the first three or four slides real.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
So, Casey actually has to do a lot of research

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
on how to sell real estate in Bermuda...

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
The first three slides, I have to, like, do more work

What's one of the oddest ones you think you've done so far?

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
Well, real estate's amazing, because, like, it goes from,

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000

In the waiting-room challenge, to get you guys to laugh,

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
Murr had his nipples fully erect.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
I mean, and this worked because Murr's nipples are always...

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
-Always. -...fully erect,

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
that soundtrack, our commentary, that's all taken away.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
to be placed on Murray's lap

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000

13:34.000 --> 13:38.000
was the child actor that we hired to sit on Murray's lap

It's in my DNA. I don't know what it is. I can't not laugh.

it's gonna happen, and you're so excited about it.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000

because everybody else is probably laughing, right?

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
And the funny part about it is,

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
you use a broom and the microphone, which --

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
There's nothing really hidden about a microphone and a broom.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
When you're doing something like that, of course,

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
it's very awkward, and you're like, "What are you doing?"

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
Or it looks like an old-school, like,

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
you know, you're doing the bit or whatever,

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
and somebody either recognizes the microphone or a camera?

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
Or, I guess, don't you guys have, like --

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
Yeah, we did a coffee-cup trick.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
We've mic'd everything. Like, we've mic'd every little...

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
and then, you know, it is what it is.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
-Yeah. -And I had to go --

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
I had to go to a hearing, and none of them were there.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
And I just had no idea I was on the show.

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
And you hid the microphones inside full water bottles,

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
which I don't understand to this day.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
It was amazing. Yeah. We really stepped it up.

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
A smoke detector, an alarm clock on the wall.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
And it's interesting, too, real quick, 'cause there are times,

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
I'm sure, that you hear a lot of different things

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
that you shouldn't be hearing because everything is mic'd.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
when we were at the Carnegie Deli when I was there.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
And I went, and I palmed the guy's corned beef,

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
and I actually -- What they didn't show --

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
there was an edit -- that I actually ate it.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
They made me eat it, which was the other thing.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
And then I walked away, and I hear you guys going,

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
"Don't go back there." I'm like, "Why?"

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
'Cause the guy said, "If he comes back

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
and he tries to eat my cheese again,

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
I'm gonna stab him in the F'ing hand with a fork."

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
-Yes. Y-eah.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
I was like, "Well, I'm not gonna go back. I will not do that."

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
So, yeah, obviously, you hear everything.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
-We do. -Yeah, and sometimes, like,

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
you know, you hear things you're not supposed to.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
We would never air any of that stuff, but, like,

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
sometimes we get insights into people's lives

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
that you don't necessarily need. You know what I mean?

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
Or sometimes, people are places they're not supposed to be.

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
When people start talking, we know that we're recording you.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
We know that the audio's getting recorded.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
We'll start talking to people, and we'll be like,

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
"Oh, you know, it's a nice day in the park."
