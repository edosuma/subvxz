{\an8}Ugh! That movie stunk!

01:00.477 --> 01:02.645
{\an8}Those effects were so fake!

01:02.729 --> 01:04.147
{\an7}Effects?

01:04.230 --> 01:05.690
{\an8}What about that stupid story?

{\an7}A monkey could make

01:22.415 --> 01:24.501
{\an8}Reggie could write it

01:24.584 --> 01:26.836
{\an8}Twister could shoot it

really quick in a hurry.

03:39.844 --> 03:41.471
That's okay, Chief.

03:41.554 --> 03:42.805
I know it must be

03:42.889 --> 03:45.850
a very, very dangerous
and important mission.

03:45.934 --> 03:48.645
That is right.
Your old arch-nemesis brother

04:11.334 --> 04:12.669
Don't worry, Chief.

04:12.752 --> 04:13.836
I'll stop him.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.296
We already have

one of our other little agent

She will help you, little cuz.

04:22.220 --> 04:23.096
(<i> chuckles</i> )

04:23.179 --> 04:24.055
You know, this reminds me

used to say.

04:28.184 --> 04:30.103
"The macadamia nut..."

04:30.186 --> 04:32.522
I must stop the evil Dr. Lars.

04:32.605 --> 04:36.651
But first, I think I'll pay
a little visit to the lab.

04:41.906 --> 04:44.951
(<i> audience laughing</i> )

04:45.034 --> 04:46.703
Uh, The Super Board UXB

04:58.965 --> 05:01.300
I guess that means
this board can fly.

05:04.470 --> 05:07.640
I'd better take
my atomic-assist surfboard

05:07.724 --> 05:09.726
and communication helmet
and get going.

05:09.809 --> 05:12.562

{\an3}Go, Reg.

06:09.702 --> 06:10.286
Yes!

{\an1}Don't worry,
I'm your contact.

06:13.539 --> 06:16.417
Come on, I've got
a secret hideout.

06:25.009 --> 06:26.928
You're the exotic Regina?

06:27.011 --> 06:29.806
You don't look
very exotic.

06:29.889 --> 06:30.807
Whatever.

06:30.890 --> 06:35.061
{\an1}The evil Dr. Lars' evil lair
is right over there.

Looks like

06:47.406 --> 06:50.159
it's too well guarded
for a frontal assault.

06:50.243 --> 06:52.995
I'll take you
to a secret entrance

06:53.079 --> 06:55.164
that will put us
right inside the lair.

Yes, dude.

08:11.115 --> 08:14.952
Won't he be interested when
we show him these intruders?

Oh, no. Oh, no.

{\an1}Oh, help.

08:49.528 --> 08:53.074
a hundred Ocean Force agents
will be here to take my place.

You'll never win, Lars!

08:55.034 --> 08:57.078
Don't worry, Otto.

08:57.161 --> 08:58.913
I'm not going
to whomp you.

one dork leaves.

Sorry about the dork crack,
Mr. Rocket.

09:41.706 --> 09:44.417
Do you have anything to say
before we begin?

09:44.500 --> 09:45.835
Yeah. See ya.

my Super Board.

10:03.269 --> 10:04.478
Nice work, Regina.

10:04.562 --> 10:06.856
Now let's get this
board out of here

10:06.939 --> 10:08.441
before these
guys wake up.

10:08.524 --> 10:11.777
Okay. One more thing.

Good thinking, Reggie...
I mean, Regina.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.729
{\an1}Shouldn't we
be getting back?

10:46.812 --> 10:49.398
{\an1}We have a long paddle
ahead of us.

10:49.482 --> 10:50.983
You're right.
Let's go.

10:51.067 --> 10:51.567
{\an3}Hello.

10:51.650 --> 10:53.986
Why don't we
just fly home

Shh! We can't!

it would be.

Not at all, little cuz.

11:32.316 --> 11:33.651
{\an3}No, you!

11:32.316 --> 11:33.651
No, you!

11:33.734 --> 11:35.277
{\an4}Reggie,
you rocked.

11:35.361 --> 11:37.488
Way awesome, Reg.

11:37.571 --> 11:39.407
You two, guys.

11:39.490 --> 11:41.700
That movie stunk
on ice!

11:41.784 --> 11:44.120
A monkey could make a
better movie than that!

11:44.203 --> 11:45.121
So why don't we?

11:45.204 --> 11:46.747
All:
Yeah!

Ow! That hurts!

12:23.242 --> 12:25.077
Tell me about it.

Woof!

12:26.078 --> 12:28.330
What happened?

12:28.414 --> 12:29.290
Uh...

12:29.373 --> 12:30.416
I'm sorry, you guys.

12:30.499 --> 12:31.709
You came out of nowhere

12:31.792 --> 12:34.128
and I was just trying
to grind that rail.

12:34.211 --> 12:35.921
I didn't see you coming.

12:36.005 --> 12:37.214
I stink at grinding.

12:37.298 --> 12:39.300
No, Squid, you stink
at skateboarding.

12:39.383 --> 12:41.635
Tell me about it.

12:41.719 --> 12:43.012
Ooh!

12:43.095 --> 12:45.014
Oh, Sammy, ever
since you got here

12:45.097 --> 12:46.849
you've gotten
better and better.

12:46.932 --> 12:48.517
{\an5}You're a pretty
good surfer and

12:48.601 --> 12:51.687
So what
if you can't grind.

12:51.770 --> 12:52.021
Or do a fakie.

12:52.104 --> 12:53.189
Or a nollie.

12:53.272 --> 12:55.524
Can he do a 360?

12:55.608 --> 12:58.986
No, he can't do
a kick-flip, either.

Okay.

13:04.241 --> 13:04.825
Ah!

13:04.909 --> 13:06.702
You got to look
both ways

13:06.785 --> 13:08.204
before you grind
that rail next time

13:08.287 --> 13:09.997
okay, Sammy?

13:24.053 --> 13:27.932
They must be done repaving
the California Incline.

13:28.015 --> 13:28.557
You know what
I'm thinking.

13:28.641 --> 13:31.519
High speed is what we need.

13:31.602 --> 13:33.103
Exactly.

13:33.187 --> 13:35.231
What's the California Incline?

13:35.314 --> 13:38.567
It's only the steepest,
most famous skateboarding street

13:38.651 --> 13:40.277
in Ocean Shores.

13:40.361 --> 13:41.028
Oh, really?

13:41.111 --> 13:43.781
California Incline,
here we come.

13:43.864 --> 13:43.948
Woo-hoo!

13:49.787 --> 13:52.081
The Incline's so clean
you can eat off it.

13:52.164 --> 13:54.500
Whoa!

13:54.583 --> 13:55.751
Speaking of eating...

13:55.834 --> 13:56.919
{\an3}Oh...

13:57.002 --> 13:58.420
Ooh... isn't it a great time

13:58.504 --> 14:01.090

or onion rings at the Shack?

this hill up so bad

14:23.153 --> 14:24.613
Yeah!

14:24.697 --> 14:25.948
Nah!

14:26.031 --> 14:29.034
Why don't you put your money
where your mouth is.

14:29.118 --> 14:30.953
I don't have any money.

14:31.036 --> 14:32.413
Why don't we just race?

14:32.496 --> 14:34.790
Winner gets the Incline
named after him.

14:34.873 --> 14:36.792
You got it, Rocket Dork!

14:36.875 --> 14:38.127

will chicken out

21:26.034 --> 21:28.870
Adios, amigos!

21:28.954 --> 21:30.622
Sammy, no!

21:40.841 --> 21:42.384
We won, Lars!

21:42.467 --> 21:43.927
(<i> laughs</i> )

21:44.011 --> 21:44.886
Bust!

21:44.970 --> 21:46.596
The Squid dork did it.

21:46.680 --> 21:48.056
I did it!

21:48.140 --> 21:52.769
Oh, wait,
how do I stop this thing?!

21:54.688 --> 21:56.314
(<i> screams</i> )

21:58.859 --> 21:59.693
Oh... ohh...

22:15.542 --> 22:18.462
How long you got
to wear that cast?

22:18.545 --> 22:19.880
(<i> all laughing</i> )

22:19.963 --> 22:22.466
You were pretty awesome today,
Sammy.

22:22.549 --> 22:23.425
Yeah, man!

22:23.508 --> 22:24.676
You won it for us!

22:24.760 --> 22:26.261
You were truly
un-Squid-like.

22:26.344 --> 22:29.848
Not bad
for a stinky skateboarder, huh?

22:29.931 --> 22:31.266
I think Sammy
earned himself

22:31.349 --> 22:32.184
a new nickname.

22:32.267 --> 22:33.101
{\an1}What do you think,
Rocket Boy?

22:33.185 --> 22:37.606
How about...
Screaming Sammy?

22:37.689 --> 22:39.649
No, that's stinks.

22:39.733 --> 22:40.734
{\an1}What about,
Dive-bomb Dullard?

22:40.817 --> 22:43.487
The Flying Squid?

22:43.570 --> 22:45.572
How about...

22:45.655 --> 22:47.115
The Sam Man!?

22:47.199 --> 22:48.116
Yeah!

22:48.200 --> 22:50.285
Go, Sam Man!

22:50.368 --> 22:51.620
Awesome!

22:51.703 --> 22:52.579
(<i> screams</i> )

22:52.662 --> 22:53.538
Sorry!
