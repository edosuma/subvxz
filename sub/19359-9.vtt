WEBVTT

00:17.834 --> 00:18.917
What are you doing on my block?

00:19.166 --> 00:20.250
Well, I'm looking
for you, actually.

00:20.542 --> 00:21.917
Congratulations,
you have located me.

00:22.250 --> 00:24.083
I wanna raise
your child with you.

00:25.750 --> 00:27.166
You know,
I've been really scared.

00:27.458 --> 00:29.125
I didn't wanna tell everyone,
'cause it's like,

00:29.125 --> 00:30.834
I don't want people
to think I'm insane.

00:31.250 --> 00:33.417
I will say,
I'm not doing great.

00:33.417 --> 00:34.750
I can't pretend that
I don't care

00:35.083 --> 00:37.417
that Adam is with Hannah,
figuring out how to raise

00:37.667 --> 00:39.625
her baby. Her baby!

00:40.250 --> 00:41.083
(SOBS)

00:41.792 --> 00:43.583
ADAM: Maybe we just
find a new place.

00:43.583 --> 00:44.625
There's a lot on Craigslist.

00:44.959 --> 00:47.041
They tend to favor
married couples, though,

00:47.041 --> 00:48.750
so it might help if we did that.

00:52.708 --> 00:54.917
-If I buzz, will you let me in?
-Yeah.

01:05.500 --> 01:07.458
( music playing )

01:11.250 --> 01:13.417
Man:
He said he'd meet us
at the quad.

01:13.417 --> 01:15.500
( indistinct chatter )

01:21.125 --> 01:23.000
Woman:
...with Anise, like,
seven minutes ago.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.542
I'm sorry if that makes me,
like, moralistic or whatever,

01:25.542 --> 01:27.041
but I have my principles.

01:27.041 --> 01:28.792
Man:
Uh, where were
your principles

01:28.792 --> 01:31.375
when you were rolling around
under a porch with Tom,

01:31.375 --> 01:33.458
like, "Oh,
where's my headband?"

01:33.458 --> 01:35.041
Tom is poly
and we all know that.

01:35.041 --> 01:36.834
Don't sleep
on that fact.

01:36.834 --> 01:38.250
I ain't sleeping
on shit

01:38.250 --> 01:41.208
except maybe Tom
because he's also bi.

01:41.208 --> 01:43.000
And I'd like to remind
the three of you

01:43.000 --> 01:45.208
not to sleep
on this friendship

01:45.208 --> 01:47.166
because I know if feels like
it's just gonna be, like,

01:47.166 --> 01:48.667
love and lust
pushing you forward,

01:48.667 --> 01:50.500
but lust fades
and friendship
never does.

01:50.500 --> 01:51.834
If you nurture it.

01:51.834 --> 01:53.792
- Do you need something?
- Mm-mm.

01:53.792 --> 01:56.333
Nope, just loving
the vibe of the campus,
very evolved.

01:56.333 --> 01:57.667
Loving the smoothie bar.

01:57.667 --> 01:59.500
Have a beautiful day.

01:59.500 --> 02:01.667
Woman:
Somebody's mom?

02:01.667 --> 02:04.458
- Man: Oh!
She's probably continuing ed.
- Woman: That is so sad.

02:04.458 --> 02:06.875
So, yeah,
I'm just kind of amazed
to be at this interview.

02:06.875 --> 02:09.417
To me, professors
have always been people
with, you know, like,

02:09.417 --> 02:11.375
MFAs and country houses

02:11.375 --> 02:13.875
and possibly
a neck goiter.

02:13.875 --> 02:15.917
When I came here
two years ago

02:15.917 --> 02:19.625
from Syracuse-- armpit;
don't tell anyone--

02:19.625 --> 02:22.375
I had one goal in mind
when I took over
this department,

02:22.375 --> 02:25.708
and that was to just pump it
full of fresh blood, you know.

02:25.708 --> 02:29.208
Just like a human heart
beating, beating, beating.

02:29.208 --> 02:30.875
Or a nice young cock.

02:30.875 --> 02:32.792
- Whoa! Yeah.
- Because, hey,

02:32.792 --> 02:35.583
what do you want
your students to leave with?

02:35.583 --> 02:37.959
Hope and wonder
and "yes"!

02:37.959 --> 02:40.291
And do you know what
has more possibility

02:40.291 --> 02:42.041
than absolutely
anything else?

02:42.041 --> 02:45.041
A nice young cock?
Is that... it?

02:45.041 --> 02:46.625
The Internet.

02:46.625 --> 02:48.250
Yes.

02:48.250 --> 02:50.667
And you, my dear,
you write for the Internet.

02:50.667 --> 02:51.959
And, boy, do you write.

02:51.959 --> 02:53.625
And when I read your stuff,

02:53.625 --> 02:56.750
it's honest, it's frank,
it's, "Here I am.

02:56.750 --> 02:59.041
- Fucking take it
or leave it."
- Yeah.

02:59.041 --> 03:01.417
You are a fucking hotshot.

03:01.417 --> 03:03.000
Thank you.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.667
Okay, so let's
talk logistics.

03:04.667 --> 03:06.959
Um, a hundred students.

03:06.959 --> 03:08.583
Groups of 25.

03:08.583 --> 03:11.250
Doing seminars,
then a little one-on-one time.

03:11.250 --> 03:12.917
"Cozy time,"
I like to call it.

03:12.917 --> 03:13.917
Can you do it?

03:13.917 --> 03:15.542
Can you show
these students

03:15.542 --> 03:18.917
the real guts and meat
of the Internet?

03:18.917 --> 03:20.250
What it's really for?

03:20.250 --> 03:21.583
Yes, I can.

03:21.583 --> 03:23.917
I am 100% the right person
to show them the Internet.

03:23.917 --> 03:26.166
And also,
just to bring up, whatever,
the elephant in the room,

03:26.166 --> 03:27.917
I know it's illegal
for you to ask.

03:27.917 --> 03:30.458
I know my body's
kind of confusing,
but, yes, I am pregnant.

03:30.458 --> 03:32.834
And I plan to work
right through having
the baby.

03:32.834 --> 03:35.125
That is not an issue for me.
I got through a high school
production of "Guys and Dolls"

03:35.125 --> 03:37.500
with full-scale
spinal meningitis.
I can do anything.

03:37.500 --> 03:40.083
You know what
gave it away as soon
as you came in the door?

03:40.083 --> 03:42.125
- What?
- Breasts.

03:42.125 --> 03:44.208
Gorgeous fruit.

03:44.208 --> 03:46.041
( whistles )
Beautiful.

03:46.041 --> 03:47.667
Pregnant women
and young mothers

03:47.667 --> 03:50.583
are the most vital force
on this earth,

03:50.583 --> 03:54.125
and when I was pregnant,
oh, my God,

03:54.125 --> 03:55.875
the men that hit on me...

03:55.875 --> 03:57.959
Do you know
who Norman Mailer is?

03:57.959 --> 03:59.250
Yeah, Norman Mailer.

03:59.250 --> 04:00.458
He had a friend named Jeff

04:00.458 --> 04:02.917
who was fucking crazy
for me.

Woman:
Hi, Hannah?

04:58.083 --> 04:59.500
Hannah, Phaedra.

04:59.500 --> 05:01.542
Oh, hi! Oh, my God,
I'm so glad I answered.

05:01.542 --> 05:04.041
When do I ever do that?
Because who the hell wants
to talk on the phone?

05:04.041 --> 05:06.792
Well, I do.
For hours a night, actually.

05:06.792 --> 05:08.583
Great, yeah.
I mean, I love it.

05:08.583 --> 05:10.959
It's just hard
to find other, you know,
millennials to engage.

05:10.959 --> 05:13.417
- Hi.
- I just wanted
to let you know

05:13.417 --> 05:15.375
that I have spoken
with my colleagues

05:15.375 --> 05:17.834
and, despite their
old, shriveled balls,

05:17.834 --> 05:19.875
we would like to offer you
the position.

05:19.875 --> 05:22.250
Oh! Oh, my God, wow.

05:22.250 --> 05:23.708
I mean, I must have been
very impressive.

05:23.708 --> 05:25.417
That was--
that was so fast.

05:25.417 --> 05:26.875
We connected hardcore.

05:26.875 --> 05:28.875
Listen, this is so weird,

05:28.875 --> 05:31.041
but my mom always says
that you should sleep on it

05:31.041 --> 05:32.708
before accepting
any new job.

05:32.708 --> 05:34.250
And I've literally
never taken her advice,

05:34.250 --> 05:38.333
but I've also never been
successful at a job,

05:38.333 --> 05:41.083
so I want to take
24 hours

05:41.083 --> 05:42.583
to think about it,
if that's okay.

05:42.583 --> 05:44.000
Follow your bliss,
my lady.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.917
Just get back to me
by Monday.

05:45.917 --> 05:47.792
Okay, great.
Thank you so much.

05:49.875 --> 05:51.208
Fuck!

05:51.208 --> 05:54.208
( music playing )

05:56.000 --> 05:59.208
I just don't understand
why you would want to leave
New York, okay?

05:59.208 --> 06:01.208
That's like something
your family makes you do

06:01.208 --> 06:04.250
when you're too deep
into crack to stop them.

06:04.250 --> 06:07.875
That's not something
that a young, vibrant,

06:07.875 --> 06:09.792
albeit pregnant,
person does.

06:09.792 --> 06:13.250
I don't know, Elijah,
I just think it's time
to admit that, like,

06:13.250 --> 06:15.708
New York hasn't brought me
anything but misery.

06:15.708 --> 06:17.083
That's insane!

06:17.083 --> 06:20.625
This is the greatest city
in the world.

06:20.625 --> 06:21.875
What are you gonna do?

06:21.875 --> 06:23.583
You're gonna leave,

06:23.583 --> 06:25.959
gonna go up
to the goddamn woods

06:25.959 --> 06:28.500
or wherever the fuck
you're going.

06:28.500 --> 06:30.458
Teach?

06:30.458 --> 06:32.041
Write?

06:32.041 --> 06:33.834
Live in a house?

06:33.834 --> 06:36.125
I mean, literally
all three of those things.

06:38.625 --> 06:40.500
I don't know, Elijah,
you know?

06:40.500 --> 06:43.750
This place is just--
it's too hard to make
a living here.

06:43.750 --> 06:45.792
My baby needs
some kind of peace.

06:45.792 --> 06:47.208
I don't even have
health insurance.

06:47.208 --> 06:48.834
This job has
benefits and stuff.

06:48.834 --> 06:50.458
Do you remember
when we first moved here?

06:50.458 --> 06:52.291
Yeah,
like it was yesterday.

06:52.291 --> 06:53.959
You proposed
on St. Mark's Place,

06:53.959 --> 06:55.625
but then you
admitted you had chlamydia,
and you were crying,

06:55.625 --> 06:56.959
and you wouldn't say
where it came from.

06:56.959 --> 06:58.208
You said it was
a McDonald's bathroom.

06:58.208 --> 06:59.834
Ga ga ga ga ga.

06:59.834 --> 07:02.375
The details
are not important.

07:02.375 --> 07:04.667
What's important is

07:04.667 --> 07:07.375
we agreed to live here

07:07.375 --> 07:09.125
and suffer and be miserable

07:09.125 --> 07:12.667
in this godforsaken
rat hole together.

07:12.667 --> 07:15.041
That's a contract
you and me made.

07:17.375 --> 07:19.000
You can't give up on that.

07:20.750 --> 07:22.166
I don't know.

07:22.166 --> 07:23.625
And if you think
I'm gonna move up there

07:23.625 --> 07:25.834
and marry you
and be your Tad,

07:25.834 --> 07:28.375
you are sorely
mistaken, ma'am.

07:28.375 --> 07:29.834
Probably.

07:33.125 --> 07:35.750
Hey, you want
to come sleep with me?

07:35.750 --> 07:37.333
No.

07:38.792 --> 07:40.375
Wait, for sex?

07:40.375 --> 07:42.125
Hannah:
No, what?

07:42.125 --> 07:44.333
I mean,
what if it was for sex?

07:44.333 --> 07:45.667
No?

07:47.125 --> 07:49.375
I just want to be clear
about the invitation.

07:49.375 --> 07:51.250
Will you sing to me?

07:52.458 --> 07:54.458
I'll give you one Demi,

07:54.458 --> 07:56.875
but then it's light's out.

07:56.875 --> 07:58.542
I had to unfollow her
on Instagram.

I think it's
just what you need.

08:55.750 --> 08:57.208
We'll come visit you
on the weekends

08:57.208 --> 08:59.375
and you can stay with us
whenever you have work to do.

08:59.375 --> 09:01.000
Go, baby, go.

09:01.000 --> 09:04.333
On the other hand,
if I had left New York
when I wanted to,

09:04.333 --> 09:06.917
I never would have
met your dad on Gay.com.

09:06.917 --> 09:10.625
And I bless that sexual
GPS service every day.

09:10.625 --> 09:13.542
Tad:
Listen, Banana,
it's only a bus ride away.

09:13.542 --> 09:18.041
We can bring cheese,
wine, books, diapers,
culture.

09:18.041 --> 09:19.208
Let's do this!

09:19.208 --> 09:20.959
You guys will
take the bus?

09:20.959 --> 09:23.875
No. No, it was just
an expression of distance.

09:23.875 --> 09:26.458
I was trying
to give you a sense
of how close you would be.

09:26.458 --> 09:29.125
Well, this drum circle's
as good a reason to leave
New York as any.

09:29.125 --> 09:30.875
Can't you drum
somewhere else?

09:30.875 --> 09:33.625
Ugh!
Get a life.

09:33.625 --> 09:35.375
Voicemail recording:
You've reached Marnie Michaels.

09:35.375 --> 09:37.083
Have a blessed day.

09:37.083 --> 09:39.125
- ( beeps )
- Marn, where are you, okay?

09:39.125 --> 09:41.583
I'm trying
to figure something out
and I really need you.

09:55.291 --> 09:57.125
Woman:
Does that one
send strength?

09:57.125 --> 09:58.834
That one smells
really good.

09:58.834 --> 10:00.667
Woman #2:
I like the slip top.

10:00.667 --> 10:04.166
Okay, so we need
one for wealth,
one for romance,

10:04.166 --> 10:06.000
and also one
to promote, like,

10:06.000 --> 10:07.875
an ease of creativity.

10:07.875 --> 10:10.458
Mm, yeah.
Like a candle's gonna
help us find an apartment

10:10.458 --> 10:12.375
that doesn't smell
like hot wings.

10:12.375 --> 10:14.041
Woman #2:
I literally don't care
if it smells like hot wings

10:14.041 --> 10:15.959
as long as you're there.

10:15.959 --> 10:18.166
Woman:
See? That's why
you're my best friend.

10:18.166 --> 10:20.667
( both laugh )

10:22.000 --> 10:23.333
I kind of like this one.

10:23.333 --> 10:24.792
I don't want that
in our apartment.

10:24.792 --> 10:26.417
Oh, okay.

10:28.250 --> 10:29.959
( rocks clatter )

10:29.959 --> 10:31.667
- Woman #2: I like purple.
- Woman: It's nice.

10:31.667 --> 10:33.583
It'll go
with the wallpaper.

10:33.583 --> 10:35.667
( women laughing,
chattering )

10:40.375 --> 10:42.375
( disconnect tone
beeping )

10:42.375 --> 10:45.166
Recording:
The number you are trying
to call is not reachable.

10:45.166 --> 10:47.375
( disconnect tone
beeping )

10:50.417 --> 10:53.875
Ugh, I can't believe
this is my fourth callback
for this fucking show.

10:53.875 --> 10:55.500
At some point I'm just
gonna have to ask them,

10:55.500 --> 10:58.166
"Hey, are we fuck buddies
or are we exclusive?"

10:58.166 --> 11:00.750
Well, maybe they're waiting
for your hoop shooting
to improve.

11:00.750 --> 11:02.917
How's your goodbye tour?

11:02.917 --> 11:04.542
Confusing.

11:04.542 --> 11:06.792
I mean, can't someone
just tell me exactly
what to do,

11:06.792 --> 11:09.208
but in a way that makes it
seem like it's my idea?

11:09.208 --> 11:11.583
Yes.
You should have sex
before you leave

11:11.583 --> 11:14.333
'cause I don't know
what kind of dick's gonna
be up in the boondocks.

11:14.333 --> 11:16.834
Great idea.
I will call up
one of the guys

11:16.834 --> 11:19.583
who would love
to have sex with this.

11:19.583 --> 11:21.917
I'm sure there's
plenty of quality people

11:21.917 --> 11:25.166
who would love to have sex
with what you got going on.

11:25.166 --> 11:26.583
And not murder you.

11:26.583 --> 11:27.917
( laughs )

11:27.917 --> 11:29.542
I don't know,
maybe you're right.

11:29.542 --> 11:31.667
Maybe I am leaving too early
and I haven't, like,

11:31.667 --> 11:33.417
made a proper mark
on this city.

11:33.417 --> 11:37.125
Hannah, you've made so many
wonderful friendships here.

11:38.333 --> 11:40.750
( snickering, laughing )

11:40.750 --> 11:42.583
That's not a thing.

11:43.625 --> 11:44.917
I got to go.

11:44.917 --> 11:46.875
Look.
I stole these.

11:46.875 --> 11:49.208
Oh, my God!
I'm so proud of you.

11:49.208 --> 11:51.000
This is the type of fun
that we have.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.500
I steal yogurts
and then we laugh
about it.

11:54.500 --> 11:56.083
What the fuck
are you doing?

11:56.083 --> 11:57.792
( zipper zips )

11:57.792 --> 11:59.542
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

11:59.542 --> 12:01.125
Kick.

12:25.667 --> 12:27.291
( mouthing )

12:29.333 --> 12:30.667
( mouthing )

12:30.667 --> 12:32.375
( mouthing )

12:36.834 --> 12:38.917
( mouthing )

12:38.917 --> 12:41.000
( mouthing )

12:42.250 --> 12:43.166
( mouths )

12:44.750 --> 12:46.667
Man over P.A.:
This is Greenpoint Avenue.

12:46.667 --> 12:48.583
Next stop:
21st Street.

12:48.583 --> 12:50.708
Stay clear
of the closing doors.

12:53.917 --> 12:56.500
Do you need help
walking up the steps

12:56.500 --> 12:58.417
or anything, ma'am?

12:58.417 --> 13:02.000
The "ma'am"
is a little much,
I would say.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.542
- ( baby babbling )
- Woman: Shall we do it now?
You do yours.

13:04.542 --> 13:06.583
- You do yours.
- ( baby cooing )

13:06.583 --> 13:08.375
Whoa, Caroline, hi.

13:08.375 --> 13:10.667
My darling one.

13:10.667 --> 13:13.041
- Oh.
- Wow.

13:13.041 --> 13:14.917
It's--
it's really wild
to see you.

13:14.917 --> 13:18.208
We did not know, uh,
if you were alive.

13:18.208 --> 13:20.417
Ooh, wow.

13:20.417 --> 13:22.208
( gasps )

13:22.208 --> 13:24.250
Life's so wild,
isn't it?

13:24.250 --> 13:25.708
Isn't it?

13:25.708 --> 13:27.542
I mean, you know,
who knew all you needed

13:27.542 --> 13:29.166
was the right
cocktail of pills

13:29.166 --> 13:31.583
and then you could
really stabilize.

13:31.583 --> 13:34.417
I mean, for now.
Who knows for sure?

13:34.417 --> 13:36.792
And you, my beauty,

13:36.792 --> 13:38.625
how are you
experiencing life?

13:38.625 --> 13:39.917
Laird tells me that...

13:39.917 --> 13:42.333
( gasps )
you are with child.

13:42.333 --> 13:44.208
I am, yes.
I'm carrying a child

13:44.208 --> 13:46.875
and it looks like
I'm gonna be moving
out of the city, so.

13:46.875 --> 13:49.542
Good. Good.
I'm fairly certain that...

13:49.542 --> 13:52.250
( softly )
my leaving the city
is what cured me.

13:52.250 --> 13:53.792
- Really?
- Oh, yes.

13:53.792 --> 13:56.542
And a very short
but powerful stay
in the hospital.

13:56.542 --> 13:57.750
Yeah.

13:57.750 --> 13:59.208
So, yes.

13:59.208 --> 14:01.041
Yes.

14:01.041 --> 14:02.291
Yes, Hannah, go.

14:02.291 --> 14:05.083
Go. I release you
like a bird,

14:05.083 --> 14:07.208
like a wild bird
into the night.

14:07.208 --> 14:11.083
I release you
like a bird!

14:11.083 --> 14:12.875
Go! Go!

14:12.875 --> 14:15.834
You know, I forgot something
that I was gonna get
at the corner store.

14:15.834 --> 14:17.583
- Bye, Sample.
- Oh.

14:17.583 --> 14:19.625
Well, I didn't mean
right now, but, yes.

14:24.500 --> 14:26.625
( cell phone chiming )

14:29.250 --> 14:30.417
( chiming stops )

14:31.542 --> 14:32.875
Marn, call me back, okay?

14:32.875 --> 14:35.250
I have an actual problem
about actual life.

14:35.250 --> 14:36.458
Please.

14:58.125 --> 14:59.625
( buzzer buzzes )

15:01.166 --> 15:03.792
- ( door buzzes )
- ( lock clicks )

15:06.166 --> 15:08.583
- ( muffled music playing )
- ( muffled chatter )

15:10.625 --> 15:13.125
- ( music blaring )
- ( chattering )

15:19.041 --> 15:21.625
- Woman: Rice.
- Shoshanna: I know it's
so traditional to throw rice,

15:21.625 --> 15:23.083
but I just don't think
I want them throwing it,

15:23.083 --> 15:25.083
because then the pigeons
eat it and I hear they die.

15:25.083 --> 15:26.834
I don't want that
on my conscience,
you know?

15:26.834 --> 15:29.625
Hey. Hi.

15:29.625 --> 15:31.375
Hannah.

15:31.375 --> 15:33.166
Hi, um...

15:33.166 --> 15:36.542
I'm so sorry,
will you guys just excuse me
for just one second?

15:36.542 --> 15:39.166
Um... hi.

15:39.166 --> 15:42.083
I don't mean to be rude,
but what are you doing here?

15:42.083 --> 15:43.792
- Hey.
- Well, I stopped by
to see you,

15:43.792 --> 15:46.583
but it seems like maybe
I picked a bad time.

15:46.583 --> 15:49.000
Uh, yeah, actually,
you kind of did.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.208
You had a party
and you didn't invite me?

15:51.208 --> 15:54.500
I mean, this place
is, like, at capacity.

15:54.500 --> 15:56.500
Yeah, I did.

15:56.500 --> 15:58.959
Which would be strange,
except you're having a baby

15:58.959 --> 16:00.792
and you neglected to tell me
after you literally

16:00.792 --> 16:02.542
told everyone else
on the face of the earth.

16:02.542 --> 16:04.917
So, um, I guess
that just kind of says

16:04.917 --> 16:07.542
who we are
to each other.

16:07.542 --> 16:09.500
Will you actually excuse me?
It's just kind of impolite

16:09.500 --> 16:12.041
to leave your guests hanging
at your own engagement party.

16:14.417 --> 16:16.041
You're engaged?

16:16.041 --> 16:18.542
This is an engagement
party for you?

16:18.542 --> 16:21.417
Marnie:
Yeah, so, you know,
I'm still at my mom's condo.

16:21.417 --> 16:23.291
Like, a totally
tough situation

16:23.291 --> 16:26.041
and all my stuff is in
these cute little things
at Manhattan Mini Storage.

16:26.041 --> 16:27.375
What the fuck
is going on?

16:27.375 --> 16:29.667
Why didn't you answer
any of my calls all day?

16:29.667 --> 16:33.458
Could you, uh--
just, we'll be back.

16:33.458 --> 16:34.708
Or we won't.

16:36.625 --> 16:38.041
( sighs )

16:40.000 --> 16:41.500
I didn't want you
to feel left out.

16:41.500 --> 16:43.583
Good job.
Yeah, it worked
super great.

16:43.583 --> 16:45.250
What the fuck
is this party?

16:45.250 --> 16:48.166
- Shosh is engaged.
- I can see that.

16:48.166 --> 16:50.208
I didn't even know
she was dating anyone.

16:50.208 --> 16:51.834
It's actually very cute.

16:51.834 --> 16:54.417
She and Byron
met at a Sprinkles
vending machine for cupcakes.

16:54.417 --> 16:57.959
- I don't even know if she has
a new number or something.
- ( glass clinking )

16:57.959 --> 16:59.750
- Hello!
- Hello, everyone.

16:59.750 --> 17:01.291
- Hi!
- Pardon us.

17:01.291 --> 17:02.750
Shoshanna:
We just wanted
to take a moment

17:02.750 --> 17:05.083
to thank
our most important people

17:05.083 --> 17:08.290
for gathering in
our newly shared dwelling

17:08.290 --> 17:10.583
for this
very important soiree.

17:10.583 --> 17:14.250
Byron: We are
so happy to have everyone
we love most in one place

17:14.250 --> 17:17.040
- to celebrate
the fact that I asked--
- And I said yes!

17:17.040 --> 17:19.000
- ( squeals )
- ( chuckles )

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
And I know
that we moved fast

17:21.000 --> 17:22.458
and that doesn't
always work out.

17:22.458 --> 17:24.125
- No, it doesn't.
- Jesus.

17:24.125 --> 17:27.250
- You're here, too?
- Yeah, Shosh and I are bros.

17:27.250 --> 17:30.375
...and I truly cannot wait
to be Mrs. Byron Long.

17:30.375 --> 17:32.208
Guests: Aw!

17:32.208 --> 17:34.959
- I love you!
- I love you!

17:34.959 --> 17:36.917
- Both: Cheers!
- Guests: Cheers!

17:36.917 --> 17:38.959
Cheers, guys!
Enjoy.

17:38.959 --> 17:40.625
This is insane.

17:40.625 --> 17:42.291
Hannah, hi.

17:42.291 --> 17:45.041
Um, since you're here,
this is Byron.

17:45.041 --> 17:47.125
- Hi.
- Pleasure, Byron.

17:47.125 --> 17:50.125
So, basically,
you're gonna act
as if you invited me?

17:50.125 --> 17:53.458
Uh, yeah, I think I'm gonna
pretend like I invited you
to my engagement party,

17:53.458 --> 17:56.125
and you wore overalls,
which is a pretty
typical move.

17:56.125 --> 17:58.041
( clears throat )
Slim, I'm gonna go out
and grab some ice.

17:58.041 --> 18:00.083
- All right.
I love you, Sticks.
- Love you.

18:00.083 --> 18:02.250
( both smooching )

18:02.250 --> 18:04.041
I mean,
what am I gonna do,

18:04.041 --> 18:05.959
like, start a fight
and ruin this for
Byron and for me?

18:05.959 --> 18:07.000
I don't think so.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.041
- Hey!
- Not you, and not now.

18:10.041 --> 18:13.166
- Not in the mood.
- Okay, you know what?
I can't handle this right now.

18:13.166 --> 18:15.250
So, my fiancé
has gone to get ice

18:15.250 --> 18:17.959
and I'm going to enjoy
my engagement party, okay?

18:17.959 --> 18:18.917
No.

18:18.917 --> 18:21.375
Group meeting,
outside, now.

18:21.375 --> 18:23.375
- Gross.
- No.

18:23.375 --> 18:25.458
Okay, group meeting
in the bathroom.

18:25.458 --> 18:26.500
Let's do that.

18:32.208 --> 18:33.750
( door closes )

18:33.750 --> 18:35.500
Shoshanna:
Marnie, I want you to know

18:35.500 --> 18:37.000
that the only reason
that I am tolerating

18:37.000 --> 18:39.500
this insanely rude
and inconsiderate behavior

18:39.500 --> 18:41.542
is the fact that
every wise women knows

18:41.542 --> 18:44.000
that the worse
the engagement party,
the better the wedding, okay?

18:44.000 --> 18:46.542
Can you tell me what this is,
what we're doing here?

18:46.542 --> 18:48.041
I don't understand.

18:48.041 --> 18:50.000
We're having
a group meeting.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.125
I don't want to have
a group meeting.

18:52.125 --> 18:53.625
This seems
inappropriate.

18:53.625 --> 18:55.041
Well, that's probably
about the only thing

18:55.041 --> 18:56.125
we can all
agree on right now.

18:56.125 --> 18:57.500
We are not
going to throw

18:57.500 --> 19:00.208
randomized grenades
of hostility at each other.

19:00.208 --> 19:03.750
Okay? We're gonna be
the adult women that
I know we can be

19:03.750 --> 19:05.375
and say
what we're feeling.

19:05.375 --> 19:08.250
If I've learned anything
from my online therapist--

19:08.250 --> 19:09.500
Okay, great.
I'll start.

19:09.500 --> 19:11.041
I'm feeling
extremely shitty

19:11.041 --> 19:13.125
about not being invited
to Shosh's engagement party.

19:13.125 --> 19:15.708
I'm feeling like
I would like to go one place

19:15.708 --> 19:20.041
without being treated
like I'm a jezebel
or a witch.

19:21.500 --> 19:24.041
- Particularly by Hannah.
- Good luck with that.

19:24.041 --> 19:25.583
I am feeling
a lot of anxiety

19:25.583 --> 19:27.250
about the fact that
we've allowed our friendship

19:27.250 --> 19:30.166
to reach this place
of aggression and isolation.

19:30.166 --> 19:31.708
And I am
proposing that--

19:31.708 --> 19:34.583
yes, Shosh--
and thank you so much
for the hand raise.

19:34.583 --> 19:36.333
If you don't mind,

19:36.333 --> 19:38.500
I would like
to take a step back

19:38.500 --> 19:41.333
and say that
this is the reason

19:41.333 --> 19:43.166
that we can't
hang out together anymore.

19:43.166 --> 19:45.500
No, no, no, see,
I am trying to fix this

19:45.500 --> 19:49.250
so that we can hang out
as the friends that
we've always been,

19:49.250 --> 19:52.041
- and we can be again
if we just--
- Mm-mm, nope.

19:52.041 --> 19:54.250
Nope,
that's not it.

19:54.250 --> 19:56.375
We can't hang out
together anymore

19:56.375 --> 19:58.500
because we cannot
be in the same room

19:58.500 --> 20:02.208
without one of us making it
completely and entirely
about ourselves.

20:02.208 --> 20:04.959
In this instance in particular,
it happens to be Hannah,

20:04.959 --> 20:07.375
who has decided to crash
my engagement party

20:07.375 --> 20:10.500
by showing up
dressed like a member
of the "Teen Mom" cast.

20:10.500 --> 20:12.333
Well, that's not
an insult to me

20:12.333 --> 20:14.959
because it means
I look like I got railed
by a football star.

20:14.959 --> 20:16.583
Wasn't intended
to be a compliment.

20:16.583 --> 20:17.875
With the help of Byron,

20:17.875 --> 20:20.083
who has completed
all 12 steps of Al-Anon,

20:20.083 --> 20:23.959
I have come to realize
how exhausting and narcissistic

20:23.959 --> 20:26.125
and ultimately boring
this whole dynamic is.

20:26.125 --> 20:30.458
And I finally feel
brave enough to create
some distance for myself.

20:30.458 --> 20:33.542
If you guys happen to know
all of those really pretty
girls out there

20:33.542 --> 20:37.959
who have, like,
jobs and purses
and nice personalities,

20:37.959 --> 20:39.583
those are now
my friends,

20:39.583 --> 20:41.041
not you guys.

20:41.041 --> 20:43.458
I think we should all
just agree to call it.

20:43.458 --> 20:44.667
Okay?

20:44.667 --> 20:45.542
Great.

20:45.542 --> 20:46.750
If you guys
wanna stay,

20:46.750 --> 20:48.750
Byron allotted
for extra guests

20:48.750 --> 20:51.000
because that's just
the kind of guy
that Byron is.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.542
That's who
I'm with now.

20:52.542 --> 20:54.834
My fiancé, okay?

20:56.917 --> 21:00.458
- ( door closes )
- Well, Shosh will
definitely get her wish.

21:00.458 --> 21:02.708
All of you will because
I got an important job upstate

21:02.708 --> 21:04.166
and I am moving there
with my child,

21:04.166 --> 21:05.792
and none of you
will probably ever
see me again.

21:05.792 --> 21:08.250
- Wait, what?
- On the way over here,

21:08.250 --> 21:12.667
I saw a man take a shit
in the street.

21:12.667 --> 21:15.291
And in that moment,
as if it were like
a near-death experience,

21:15.291 --> 21:19.667
I flashed upon every
piece of shit I have ever seen
on the streets on New York

21:19.667 --> 21:21.000
that I assumed
was from a dog.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.166
And guess what.

21:22.166 --> 21:23.834
That shit's
not from a dog.

21:23.834 --> 21:25.500
At least
not all of it.

21:25.500 --> 21:29.708
'Cause this is a city
where people take shits
on the street!

21:29.708 --> 21:31.667
You are
moving upstate

21:31.667 --> 21:34.500
and you didn't even care
to tell me one-on-one?

21:34.500 --> 21:37.041
I called you a million times,
but you were too busy
ignoring me

21:37.041 --> 21:39.166
- since you were going to
a party I wasn't invited to.
- ( door opens )

21:39.166 --> 21:43.166
I got it!
I got the part in
"White Men Can't Jump"

21:43.166 --> 21:47.917
the fucking
musical spectacular,
you feckless whores!

21:47.917 --> 21:49.917
Hannah, I will see you
at home tomorrow

21:49.917 --> 21:53.041
roughly around noon when
I'm done partying this out.

21:53.041 --> 21:54.333
Eat a dick!

21:57.041 --> 21:58.166
Shosh was right.

22:00.041 --> 22:02.000
She was right
about everything.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.542
Can you stop
being so dramatic?

22:03.542 --> 22:05.291
I mean,
have a little perspective.

22:05.291 --> 22:06.583
She's planning
a wedding.

22:06.583 --> 22:10.041
It makes people
very hostile and aggressive.

22:10.041 --> 22:12.375
- You should know.
- Get the fuck out.

22:12.375 --> 22:14.250
Get the fuck out.
I need the room.

22:14.250 --> 22:17.583
Great, 'cause this place
smells like pussy cream
and I wish I was dead.

22:17.583 --> 22:21.041
- ( door opens, closes )
- Eight million people
in this city,

22:21.041 --> 22:23.917
and she thinks all the shit's
supposed to be from dogs?

22:23.917 --> 22:26.458
I mean, of course people
shit in the street.

22:26.458 --> 22:28.875
You've shit
in the street, right?

22:28.875 --> 22:30.500
No.

22:30.500 --> 22:32.959
Oh, you're telling me
every shit you've ever taken

22:32.959 --> 22:34.208
has been on a toilet?

22:35.875 --> 22:36.917
Yes.

22:36.917 --> 22:38.083
Oh, God.

22:38.083 --> 22:40.083
You know,
you're impossible.

22:40.083 --> 22:43.417
- ( door opens, closes )
- ( groans )

22:43.417 --> 22:47.417

22:52.750 --> 22:54.500

22:54.500 --> 22:57.208
You know, I was
barely invited myself.

22:57.208 --> 22:59.000
I was, um--

22:59.000 --> 23:00.834
I just spoke to Shosh
this morning

23:00.834 --> 23:05.291
because I needed her
to tell me my ATM code, so.

23:06.875 --> 23:08.750
It's okay, I'm fine.
You don't have to say that.

23:08.750 --> 23:10.291
I'm really fine.

23:12.250 --> 23:13.667
Are you?

23:13.667 --> 23:15.125
Yeah. I mean,
this job I got,

23:15.125 --> 23:16.542
it's like
a very big deal for me.

23:16.542 --> 23:17.959
- It's really good, so.
- Yeah.

23:19.792 --> 23:21.250
How's school?

23:22.625 --> 23:25.125
( sighs )
Uh, yeah, I quit.

23:26.542 --> 23:27.667
- Oh.
- Yeah.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.667
How come?

23:31.708 --> 23:34.625
Um, well,
I think it turns out

23:34.625 --> 23:40.166
that I wasn't as ready
to help people as I thought.

23:42.000 --> 23:47.000
And I just needed
to take a long, hard
look in the mirror

23:47.000 --> 23:49.417
as my mother
would say.

23:49.417 --> 23:50.834
What'd you see?

23:53.250 --> 23:54.708
A fucking bitch.

24:02.625 --> 24:06.875
Oh, um, I got you
something, actually.

24:06.875 --> 24:09.125
I-- I assumed
you'd be here, so.

24:12.166 --> 24:13.208
Here.

24:22.125 --> 24:24.625
It's, um,
for a child.

24:24.625 --> 24:26.458
- Yeah.
- It's a dress.

24:26.458 --> 24:28.500
The baby's
actually a boy.

24:28.500 --> 24:30.208
Is it really?

24:30.208 --> 24:33.500
I don't know how the fuck
that happened.

24:33.500 --> 24:35.375
I haven't really
processed it.

24:35.375 --> 24:37.542
You're actually kind of, like,
the first person I'm telling.

24:37.542 --> 24:40.417
- I mean, what am I supposed
to do with a boy?
- I don't know.

24:40.417 --> 24:42.583
What if I raise him perfectly
and do everything right,

24:42.583 --> 24:44.000
and then he, like, rapes
a bajillion people

24:44.000 --> 24:46.083
and, like, runs
a lawnmower over a town?

24:47.500 --> 24:48.583
No.

24:48.583 --> 24:49.875
He'll be perfect.

24:51.959 --> 24:53.708
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

25:04.667 --> 25:06.041
I'm sorry.

25:09.375 --> 25:10.750
Um...

25:14.000 --> 25:18.083
I am sorry for--
( deep breath )

25:18.083 --> 25:19.250
for everything.

25:19.250 --> 25:20.875
I don't really...

25:20.875 --> 25:22.542
You don't have to be sorry.
It's okay.

25:22.542 --> 25:24.708
I mean, it's like--
I mean, it's not okay,

25:24.708 --> 25:26.875
but it's, like, I don't know
who's really supposed to be
sorry for what,

25:26.875 --> 25:28.917
so at this point,
we should kind of
just call it a...

25:30.375 --> 25:32.417
- Like, say it.
- ( chuckles )

25:32.417 --> 25:34.708
- It's okay.
- ( sniffles ) Mm-hmm.

25:34.708 --> 25:36.083
It's okay.

25:36.083 --> 25:37.500
I mean,
think about it.

25:37.500 --> 25:39.917
Like, we were all
just doing our best, so.

25:42.792 --> 25:44.458
Our best was awful.

25:45.792 --> 25:48.417
- Worst best.
- ( chuckles )

25:52.000 --> 25:53.291
- ( sighs )
- So, what do you think?

25:53.291 --> 25:55.291
Should we, like...

25:55.291 --> 25:58.708
try to get into this
cool metropolitan vibe, or...?

25:58.708 --> 26:02.166
Yeah, um, I mean,
what else am I doing?

26:03.875 --> 26:07.750
Literally

Shoshanna's house since 4:00.

the voice of my generation.

29:37.458 --> 29:39.667
Or at least... a voice...

29:40.333 --> 29:41.834
of a generation.

29:43.166 --> 29:45.583
I want everyday to be exciting.

29:45.583 --> 29:46.333
Wooh!

29:46.708 --> 29:48.000
-And scary.
-(SCREAMS)

29:48.500 --> 29:49.917
MARNIE: Sometimes I just wish
someone would tell me,

29:50.166 --> 29:51.708
"This is how the rest
of your life should look."

29:53.667 --> 29:56.041
SHOSHANNA:
My life is a mess, and I know
that that was a personal choice.

29:56.250 --> 29:58.166
Maybe it is time for me
to un-choose that choice.

29:58.166 --> 30:00.041
We have to mine our lives
for the truth.

30:00.583 --> 30:02.625
Stay right where you are.
I'm coming to you.

30:03.625 --> 30:05.625
I haven't made my mark
on this city yet.

30:05.625 --> 30:06.875
(CHEERING)

30:07.041 --> 30:08.041
LOREEN: You made a choice.
Guess what?

30:08.583 --> 30:09.834
It's the first one
you can't take back.

30:10.208 --> 30:12.208
This is it, honey,
and this is forever.

30:20.041 --> 30:23.625
We agreed to... to live here
and suffer and be miserable

30:23.625 --> 30:25.959
in this godforsaken rat hole,
together.

30:26.333 --> 30:27.834
You can't give up on that.

30:29.375 --> 30:31.458
LENA DUNHAM: This episode
is called "Goodbye Tour."

30:31.458 --> 30:34.625
And this is the episode
in which Hannah's figuring out

30:34.875 --> 30:36.708
whether she's gonna stay
in New York City.

30:37.166 --> 30:39.083
Hannah and Marnie seem
to be in touch.

30:39.083 --> 30:41.750
Hannah and Jessa have not been
in touch for quite some time

30:41.750 --> 30:43.834
and Hannah can't get in touch
with Shoshanna,

30:43.834 --> 30:45.667
to the point where it's getting
weird and mysterious.

30:45.875 --> 30:47.750
Will you actually excuse me?
it's just kind of impolite

30:47.750 --> 30:50.375
to leave your guests hanging
at your own engagement party.

30:53.041 --> 30:54.166
You're engaged.

30:54.500 --> 30:56.417
This is an engagement party
for you.

30:56.417 --> 30:58.625
And it's not just a party
she wasn't invited to,

30:58.625 --> 31:00.667
but Shoshanna's
engagement party?

31:00.667 --> 31:03.417
Like, that's how far away
they've grown.

31:03.417 --> 31:05.500
Drifted. And she's had time
to get engaged with someone

31:05.500 --> 31:07.708
-and it's not even totally to--
-JENNI KONNER: And plan a party.

31:07.708 --> 31:10.083
And plan a party,
and it's not even that insane

31:10.083 --> 31:11.208
-that they're engaged.
-  KONNER: Right.

31:11.583 --> 31:14.917
And I truly cannot wait
to be Mrs. Byron Long.

31:16.250 --> 31:18.625
-Mmm! I love you!
-I love you!

31:18.917 --> 31:20.583
-You wanted that for Shoshanna
-KONNER: Yes.

31:20.583 --> 31:22.291
I love that you see
those girls and you're like,

31:22.291 --> 31:24.458
"Oh, she's got
a beautiful friend group,

31:24.750 --> 31:26.542
this great fiancé,

31:26.542 --> 31:28.041
she's moving forward
in her life,

31:28.041 --> 31:29.792
and she's able to advocate
for herself."

31:29.959 --> 31:31.959
I mean, what am I gonna do?
Like, start a fight

31:31.959 --> 31:34.625
and ruin this for Byron
and for me? I don't think so.

31:35.291 --> 31:36.000
Hey.

31:36.458 --> 31:38.291
Not you and not now.
Not in the mood.

31:38.291 --> 31:40.583
Group meeting in the bathroom.
Let's do that.

31:41.041 --> 31:42.959
DUNHAM: We were initially
staging it in the living room

31:42.959 --> 31:45.375
and Jenni was like, "Shouldn't
we put it in the bathroom,

31:45.375 --> 31:47.333
-where all great  Girls--
-KONNER: Girls...

31:47.333 --> 31:49.250
-conversations have taken place?
-We've built

31:49.250 --> 31:50.959
more bathrooms, I would guess,

31:50.959 --> 31:53.083
-than any show on television.
-DUNHAM: And our guest director,

31:53.083 --> 31:54.834
Nisha Ganatra, she was amazing.
She was like,

31:54.834 --> 31:56.333
"I feel like any other director
would be like,

31:56.333 --> 31:58.375
'You want me to shoot
a seven-page scene

31:58.375 --> 32:00.917
-in a two-foot bathroom?'"
-We've never even shot in that

32:00.917 --> 32:03.917
bathroom before
without having the door open.

32:03.917 --> 32:05.917
We knew we were
really asking for it,

32:05.917 --> 32:09.542
but it did just seem, like,
poetic to put them in a bathroom

32:09.542 --> 32:10.583
where they always wind up.

32:11.166 --> 32:12.917
Can you tell me what this is?
What we're doing here?

32:12.917 --> 32:16.041
-I don't understand.
-We're having a group meeting.

32:16.333 --> 32:18.083
I don't want
to have a group meeting.

32:18.083 --> 32:20.667
I remember we were
really laughing at the idea,

32:20.667 --> 32:23.875
uh, that Shoshanna would say,
"The last six years have been

32:23.875 --> 32:26.250
-a complete waste of time."
-Right. Yeah! (LAUGHS)

32:26.250 --> 32:28.375
-DUNHAM: It's basically her
denouncing the show.
-Yeah.

32:28.375 --> 32:31.417
We can't hang out together
anymore, because we cannot be

32:31.417 --> 32:34.625
in the same room without one
of us making it completely

32:34.625 --> 32:36.208
and entirely about ourselves.

32:36.500 --> 32:39.166
KONNER:
She's letting go of these girls,
and even if there's still

32:39.166 --> 32:40.500
some pain for her...

32:41.000 --> 32:44.375
The performance, I thought,
that Zosia did beautifully

32:44.375 --> 32:46.000
is like a person who's like...

32:46.875 --> 32:49.875
"You guys can keep doing this
as long as you want,

32:50.083 --> 32:52.417
but I have, like, a whole life,
and it's literally

32:52.417 --> 32:54.208
on the other side of this door."

32:54.208 --> 32:56.875
In the beginning, also, you
probably watched the show

32:56.875 --> 32:58.792
and thought, "Oh,
she's like this puppy dog.

32:58.792 --> 33:00.333
-She doesn't seem that smart."
-Right.

33:00.333 --> 33:02.417
And then there was
a choice made early on...

33:02.417 --> 33:04.750
-What if she's, like,
insanely smart?
-Right.

33:04.750 --> 33:06.041
Shosh's right...

33:07.792 --> 33:09.542
She's right about everything.

33:09.542 --> 33:11.667
They all basically say, like,
let's peace out

33:11.667 --> 33:12.708
on this friendship.

33:13.041 --> 33:15.041
And then after
finally saying to each other

33:15.041 --> 33:17.375
what they were all thinking,
they managed to actually

33:17.375 --> 33:19.542
have fun and dance together
and engage

33:19.542 --> 33:21.083
-in a way they haven't in years.
-KONNER: Yeah.

33:21.083 --> 33:22.458
And Shoshanna kind of
begrudgingly is like,

33:22.708 --> 33:24.000
"I guess they're
at my engagement party."

33:24.625 --> 33:28.708
And Jessa and Hannah have that
really sweet, emotional moment

33:28.708 --> 33:31.583
that is sort of like... opens up
the door for them to be able

33:31.583 --> 33:32.583
to talk again.

33:33.208 --> 33:35.875
GIRL: Okay, so we need one
for wealth, one for romance,

33:35.875 --> 33:39.583
and also one to promote, like,
an ease of creativity.

33:39.583 --> 33:43.000
Mmm, yeah. Like a candle is
gonna help us find an apartment

33:43.000 --> 33:44.291
that doesn't smell like
hot wings.

33:44.750 --> 33:46.166
GIRL: I literally don't care
if it smells like hot wings

33:46.166 --> 33:47.041
as long as you're there.

33:48.041 --> 33:50.250
DUNHAM:
I really like the moment when
you see Hannah watching

33:50.250 --> 33:51.917
the two girls who are excited to
have moved to New York together.

33:51.917 --> 33:54.000
KONNER: Oh, yeah!
In the magic store?

33:54.000 --> 33:55.834
In the witchcraft store,
and they're buying candles

33:55.834 --> 33:58.583
and, like, even the girls
themselves, the actors,

33:58.583 --> 34:00.417
they were so excited to be
on a set. They were new

34:00.417 --> 34:03.041
to acting. They were, like,
thrilled. They couldn't believe

34:03.041 --> 34:05.458
how good the lunch was, and it
was a reminder to me that this

34:05.458 --> 34:07.000
has been such
a beautiful job to have,

34:07.208 --> 34:09.291
and it's such a lucky thing,
and never take it for granted.

34:09.291 --> 34:11.041
And so just like it was, like,
reminding Hannah

34:11.041 --> 34:12.917
of her younger life,
it was reminding me

34:12.917 --> 34:14.583
of, like, the first day on
the pilot where I was like,

34:14.583 --> 34:17.083
-"There's chips everywhere!"
-(KONNER, APATOW LAUGH)

34:17.083 --> 34:18.500
It was really nice.
