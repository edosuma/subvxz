Tickets this way
for the Chatsworth Express!

00:05.660 --> 00:08.173
Come and watch pikeys making a mess

00:08.260 --> 00:11.855
of the lives they were given by
'im upstairs...

00:11.940 --> 00:14.898
And kids they're convinced
aren't actually theirs.

00:14.980 --> 00:16.094
Wicked!

00:16.180 --> 00:17.499
Piss off!

00:17.580 --> 00:21.368
What sounds on Earth
could ever replace

00:21.460 --> 00:24.497
kids needing money
or wives in your face?

00:24.580 --> 00:26.935
Cos this, people reckon -
me included -

00:27.020 --> 00:29.488
is why pubs and drugs

00:29.580 --> 00:31.172
were kindly invented...

00:31.260 --> 00:33.774
To calm us all down
and stop us going mental.

00:33.860 --> 00:38.570
These are Chatsworth Estate's
basic essentials.

00:38.660 --> 00:44.815
We are worth every penny
for grinding your axes...

00:44.900 --> 00:46.379
You sit on our head,

00:46.460 --> 00:49.133
but... you pay the taxes.

00:49.220 --> 00:50.619
CHEERING

00:50.700 --> 00:53.373
Imagine Britain
without Chatsworth buccaneers

00:53.460 --> 00:56.691
who'd come on your face
for the price of a beer, eh?

00:56.780 --> 00:58.259
Eh!

00:58.340 --> 01:02.094
Make poverty history.
Cheaper drugs now!

01:02.180 --> 01:07.049
Make poverty history!
Cheaper drugs now!

01:07.140 --> 01:08.459
CHUCKLES

01:08.540 --> 01:12.169
Scatter! Party!

01:18.980 --> 01:21.175
CHOKES

01:21.260 --> 01:22.818
(Frank) 'Still waiting for my moment.

01:22.900 --> 01:27.371
'Not that 15 minutes bollocks,
you know, a real one.

01:27.460 --> 01:32.136

I am the man to filleth it.

01:32.220 --> 01:34.575
'AII I want is to show the bastards.

'You know, proper like.

01:36.420 --> 01:38.695
'You know that Kipling twat?
He nailed it.'

01:38.780 --> 01:40.691
Someone call an ambulance!

01:40.780 --> 01:43.294
He needs Heimlich Manoeuvre.

01:43.380 --> 01:46.577
Help him. Will someone give him
a hand, for fuck's sake?

01:46.660 --> 01:49.891
'lf all around lose their heads
and you're... Blah, blah.

01:49.980 --> 01:53.973
'Look it up, I've set the scene.
If you're not in any personal danger,

01:54.060 --> 01:57.097
'step in, mate. Save the day.

01:57.180 --> 01:59.489
'What's more, you'll be a man,
my son.'

01:59.580 --> 02:01.571
(Shane) Calm down. Just stay there.

02:01.660 --> 02:03.332
Help him, for fuck's sake!

02:03.420 --> 02:05.729
'Yeah...

02:05.820 --> 02:07.458
'Massive.'

02:08.340 --> 02:11.457
- I've only got these.
- Put 'em down.

02:13.100 --> 02:15.489
Crawling all over my tits
fresh out of prison. Irish twat.

02:15.580 --> 02:18.538
'Scuse me, could I trouble one of...

02:18.620 --> 02:19.735
Fuck off, Frank.

02:19.820 --> 02:22.698
More sensitive soul
could take offence, you know.

02:22.780 --> 02:25.294
This is Paddy Smith.

02:25.380 --> 02:27.735
Aye, aye. No need to brick it.

02:27.820 --> 02:30.573
Shut your noise!
This is the man who was put away

02:30.660 --> 02:32.616
for crushing bigger fish than us!

02:32.700 --> 02:35.897
Runs a firm 20 times bigger than ours,
and I've infringed on his market

02:35.980 --> 02:38.699
while he's been absent.
There's cause for apprehension.

02:38.780 --> 02:40.418
Yeah, but he might let us keep it

02:40.500 --> 02:41.569
if we give him a bung.

02:41.660 --> 02:44.811
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
He won't be doing me any favours.

02:44.900 --> 02:46.333
Why not?

02:48.780 --> 02:52.739
Paddy Smith is Other Paddy.

02:54.540 --> 02:57.054
Your mother's first boyfriend.

02:57.140 --> 03:01.099
She dumped him for me.

03:01.180 --> 03:05.378
Jesus, Shane, and to think
I could've had a wank instead of you.

03:05.460 --> 03:08.338
'I mean, what's wrong
with wanting to be a hero? '

03:08.420 --> 03:10.012
- Come on, Dad.
- Stand back!

03:10.100 --> 03:12.056
'Nowt.' Crash trolley!

Ow!

03:36.420 --> 03:41.335
You saved my life. You fucking hero!

03:42.580 --> 03:45.458
Form is temporary.
Class is permanent.

03:45.540 --> 03:48.577
I'm completely shit-faced.

03:50.980 --> 03:54.290
Ah! Drinks all round!

03:54.380 --> 03:58.214
I mean, what kind of
a mutant peanut is that?

03:58.300 --> 04:00.336
It's a cashew.

04:01.940 --> 04:04.056
That's not a pub nut.

04:04.140 --> 04:05.653
Is this a wine bar?

04:05.740 --> 04:08.652
Are we going
metro-fucking-sexual here?

04:08.740 --> 04:15.452
- I was just trying something new.
- Oh, something new with a cashew!

04:15.540 --> 04:20.694
Yeah, well, lucky it was your da',
or you'd be the one choking now.

04:20.779 --> 04:24.455
Two in one night.
Chatsworth's Oscar Schindler.

04:24.540 --> 04:27.976
We're brothers now, Frank.
There's a blood debt.

04:28.060 --> 04:30.972
You're gonna find out
what Patrick Maguire's like

04:31.060 --> 04:33.494
when he's sincerely grateful.

04:35.940 --> 04:38.090
Can I have 14 more drinks, please?

04:49.060 --> 04:51.415
<i>Everybody needs a bosom</i>

04:51.500 --> 04:52.649
<i>Everybody needs...</i>

05:04.660 --> 05:06.013
What you doing?

05:06.100 --> 05:08.978
Sorry.

05:09.060 --> 05:10.812
I forgot we'd changed beds.

05:13.380 --> 05:15.496
I wasn't gonna bum ya!

05:23.540 --> 05:26.213
I know you weren't. It's all right.

05:26.300 --> 05:28.256
I'm totally cool with the gay thing.

05:29.860 --> 05:31.339
You what?

05:31.420 --> 05:32.614
I'm cool.

05:34.780 --> 05:37.453
That's cool.
I'm cool with you being cool.

05:37.540 --> 05:39.895
Piss off.

05:39.980 --> 05:41.732
(Carl) I'm telling you, he fancies you.

05:41.820 --> 05:44.573
How've we gone from no-one
knowing or talking about it

05:44.660 --> 05:46.093
to everyone having an opinion?

05:46.180 --> 05:50.651
Opinions are like bumholes,
everyone's got one. They all stink.

05:50.740 --> 05:54.096
He were asking after ya.

05:54.180 --> 05:56.136
- Mr Scott?
- Yeah, why wouldn't he?

05:56.220 --> 05:57.369
He lives with another teacher.

05:57.460 --> 05:59.132
Not any more.

05:59.220 --> 06:00.892
Above the greengrocer's
on Tuttle Street.

06:00.980 --> 06:02.811
Virgil Kenyatta's dad owns it.

06:02.900 --> 06:06.575
Scotty moved out a week ago
when his boyfriend chucked him.

06:06.660 --> 06:09.777
And now he's asking after you.
Hmm. What could this mean?

06:10.980 --> 06:12.174
He's just your type an' all.

06:12.260 --> 06:13.818
A geography teacher?

06:13.900 --> 06:15.174
(Debbie) Fit. Available.

06:15.260 --> 06:17.490
Knows all about oxbow lakes.

06:17.580 --> 06:21.016
Oh, a teacher? Didn't know
you went for older women, lan?

06:21.100 --> 06:23.330
It's a bloke.

06:23.420 --> 06:25.695
Oh. Trying to turn you, is he?

06:27.580 --> 06:30.617
Hiya, Carl.
You walking to school?

06:31.740 --> 06:32.968
Er... yeah.

06:36.340 --> 06:37.489
(lan) Who's that?

06:37.580 --> 06:40.856
Sarah Berry.
School dick magnet.

06:43.260 --> 06:44.329
So what you doing tonight, then?

06:44.420 --> 06:45.489
Come on Chesney. Hey!

06:45.580 --> 06:48.014
Me mum wants you to do a few hours
in the shop.

06:48.100 --> 06:49.419
- When?
- Now.

06:49.500 --> 06:50.899
Can't one of youse do it?

06:50.980 --> 06:51.969
She won't let us bunk off.

06:52.060 --> 06:54.255
Looks like
we're only walking to the shop.

06:54.340 --> 06:55.853
You walkin' us an' all?

06:55.940 --> 06:57.089
Get off, Meena.

06:57.180 --> 06:59.136
Don't mind me.

07:02.660 --> 07:05.333
Got mice. Little bastards.

07:05.420 --> 07:07.695
Are vegetarians allowed to say that?

07:07.780 --> 07:11.693
Anything that leaves a trail of piss
behind it deserves to die, horribly.

07:11.780 --> 07:13.338
Get stuffed.

07:13.420 --> 07:16.935
Well, I didn't mean you! Touchy...

07:17.020 --> 07:20.171
Says he didn't wet the bed.
He was putting out a fire.

07:20.260 --> 07:21.773
Look at the state, Deb.

07:21.860 --> 07:26.092
I'm living in a shit-heap
attached to a shit-hole.

07:26.180 --> 07:29.138
Mooning over
her bloody highness up there.

07:29.220 --> 07:32.257
What's she doing in my room?

07:32.340 --> 07:33.455
She's after it.

07:33.540 --> 07:34.893
Well, it is four times
the size of hers.

07:34.980 --> 07:36.254
Bitch!

07:36.340 --> 07:40.379
She's not having it.
She's only a squatter! Same as you.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.371
Oh, well, thanks very much.

07:42.460 --> 07:46.851
Well, you are. Look at the state
of this yard. It's full of crap.

07:46.940 --> 07:48.692
If you're staying, it's your space.

07:48.780 --> 07:51.419
So get off your arse
and do something about it.

07:51.500 --> 07:53.013
Well, tell it like it is,
why don't you?

07:53.100 --> 07:55.056
You're such a moaner!

07:55.140 --> 07:58.098
Make a decision
and put some effort in.

08:07.980 --> 08:10.494
Get that kettle on, Carl!

08:10.580 --> 08:11.933
(Boy) Shit!

08:12.020 --> 08:14.011
Got a throat like
Thursday's bhaji here.

08:14.100 --> 08:16.170
There's more teabags under the sink.

08:16.260 --> 08:19.252
Don't use the ones in the shop.
I don't drink counterfeit.

08:22.340 --> 08:23.978
Carl?

08:24.060 --> 08:25.732
Yeah?

08:27.620 --> 08:30.054
- Phone the police.
- And say what?

08:30.140 --> 08:31.414
Just phone the police!

08:36.500 --> 08:37.534
He saved my life.

08:37.620 --> 08:40.692
Next time, try and get saved
by someone who isn't

08:40.780 --> 08:43.169
a human... fucking... compost... heap.

08:43.260 --> 08:46.172
I'm proud to call that man friend.

08:47.620 --> 08:50.771
THEY LAUGH

08:50.860 --> 08:54.170
Might need some stock.
I'm hitting the old folk's home.

08:54.260 --> 08:56.899
Got something on.
How many bags are left?

08:56.980 --> 08:57.969
Five.

08:58.060 --> 09:00.096
Isn't that enough?

09:00.180 --> 09:04.173
Dunno. The oldies are mad for
their weed. What are you doing?

09:04.260 --> 09:05.613
Got a meet. Who with?

09:05.700 --> 09:09.932
Someone from yesteryear.
25 yesteryears to be precise.

09:10.020 --> 09:11.009
Who?

09:12.820 --> 09:13.775
Other Paddy.

09:13.860 --> 09:17.170
- Other Paddy?
- Mmmm.

09:17.260 --> 09:18.852
My Other Paddy?

09:18.940 --> 09:21.295
(Yvonne) 'Are you gonna get stuck in? '

09:21.380 --> 09:23.735
It'll take all of you
to batter that door down.

09:23.820 --> 09:25.378
I don't know how he's in there.

09:25.460 --> 09:28.213
- The little wanker!
- No need. Tom's had special training.

09:28.300 --> 09:30.495
At the negotiation workshop,
they said, "Talk first

09:30.580 --> 09:31.729
"and you won't have to act later."

09:31.820 --> 09:33.811
Rubbish! Oi!

09:33.900 --> 09:36.368
- You had your hair cut?
- Have I fuck!

09:37.980 --> 09:40.892
Every day they find
a new way to rob us.

09:44.100 --> 09:45.738
What are you lookin' at?

09:45.820 --> 09:48.618
Sorry. Just when you're angry,
your eyes...

09:48.700 --> 09:51.055
Sorry.

09:51.140 --> 09:52.698
Don't be weird, Stan.

09:55.700 --> 09:57.736
Tom here.

09:57.820 --> 09:58.855
Want to tell me your name?

09:58.940 --> 09:59.929
Fuck off. >

10:00.020 --> 10:03.854
I'm from Ireland. I... I've got
six brothers and sisters and...

10:03.940 --> 10:06.773
Ain't got time to bore him out.

10:06.860 --> 10:08.452
(Tom) What're you doing?

10:09.540 --> 10:10.859
Gas!

10:12.820 --> 10:14.173
You're nicked.

10:14.260 --> 10:16.933
You're costing me
more than the hoodie.

10:17.020 --> 10:19.659
Sorry about that.

10:19.740 --> 10:22.573
Tear gas, Lillian.
No-one can go in.

10:22.660 --> 10:24.571
Oh, no, I like a good weep, me.

10:27.180 --> 10:29.410
Search her when she leaves.

10:29.500 --> 10:31.092
Why now?

10:31.180 --> 10:33.410
He'll have heard the word
about you inside.

10:33.500 --> 10:34.728
You've moved up a division.

10:34.820 --> 10:37.175
No. I'm famine potatoes to him.

10:37.260 --> 10:40.889
Could be getting nostalgic
for the things he's lost.

10:42.500 --> 10:44.809
Doesn't matter if he is.

10:44.900 --> 10:47.130
I know I plumped for the perfect Paddy.

10:47.220 --> 10:49.176
The poorer Paddy.

10:49.260 --> 10:52.650
Look at this palace.
Every dream - fulfilled.

10:52.740 --> 10:56.619
He's dodgy. You need me with you.

10:56.700 --> 10:59.009
I can wrap him round this.
You don't lose that.

10:59.100 --> 11:00.738
Your man'll think I'm pussy-whipped.

11:00.820 --> 11:02.299
< Oh, come on, Dad.

11:02.380 --> 11:03.938
Meet him first.

11:04.020 --> 11:06.090
Then I'll bump into you in the pub.

11:06.180 --> 11:07.852
We're a team, you and me.

11:07.940 --> 11:10.295
I'm getting off, too.

11:10.380 --> 11:12.689
Picking up a car. Dad's bankrolled us.

11:12.780 --> 11:16.773
New business, executive transport.

11:16.860 --> 11:18.452
< Dad coughed up for that?

11:18.540 --> 11:20.974
Lent.

11:28.540 --> 11:29.529
You spanner.

11:29.620 --> 11:32.373
Well, s'pose you can put me right, eh?

11:46.180 --> 11:47.738
Tia Maria and coke.

11:50.140 --> 11:51.971
And a pint for shitty drawers.

11:53.620 --> 11:56.054
Couldn't stretch to
a couple of E's, could you?

11:56.140 --> 11:59.177
Me fucking ribs...

12:02.900 --> 12:04.253
You look nice, Mimi.

12:07.660 --> 12:09.855
Assisting Paddy
with a bit of business.

12:24.380 --> 12:27.770
Patrick Donal Maguire.

12:27.860 --> 12:30.328
It's good to see you, kid.

12:30.420 --> 12:32.411
- Long time...
- Aye, Paddy. How's yourself?

12:32.500 --> 12:35.617
Fine. Sure, a five-year stretch
is bullshit.

12:35.700 --> 12:39.090
At our age we could do ten years
without blinking. Am I right?

12:40.220 --> 12:43.895
Don't shite yourself, I'm not
asking you to get sent down for me.

12:43.980 --> 12:46.175
Come away! I'm ripe
for a wee bit of entertainment.

12:46.260 --> 12:48.330
I'm guessing a drink
would sit nicely.

12:48.420 --> 12:51.969
Ah, well, the bar's fully stocked.
But what I've really missed

12:52.060 --> 12:54.255
is filthy women.

12:54.340 --> 12:57.855
My balls are as heavy as
avo-fucking-cados, Patrick!

12:57.940 --> 12:59.498
Huh?

12:59.580 --> 13:01.696
I know that look.

13:01.780 --> 13:03.691
Have you laid one on for me?

13:03.780 --> 13:06.010
Have you? Huh?

13:06.100 --> 13:10.252
Patrick? Patrick,
you have, haven't you, so?

13:10.340 --> 13:11.932
Huh?

13:12.020 --> 13:14.170
Come on away.

13:16.140 --> 13:19.416
Two Guinness, son.

13:19.500 --> 13:21.536
Oh, is this her?
She would do me.

13:21.620 --> 13:23.178
She fucking wouldn't.

13:25.620 --> 13:28.896
Ah, Jesus! It's not that?
A rhino in a joy-bag.

13:28.980 --> 13:33.451
I don't want to get smothered by
some great arse, for Christ's sake.

13:35.060 --> 13:36.652
Mimi?

13:38.260 --> 13:39.613
I'm so sorry.

13:39.700 --> 13:42.931
It just came out all twisted.

13:43.020 --> 13:45.614
I've been away a long...

13:45.700 --> 13:50.490
Mimi, I said I'm sorry.

13:51.620 --> 13:53.053
Don't be like that!

14:03.300 --> 14:07.452
That's a terrible mistake
I just made there, kid.

14:07.540 --> 14:09.531
And I'm truly contrite. I am.

14:09.620 --> 14:13.693
If I could take my words back, but...

14:13.780 --> 14:16.852
it is a good time to remind you,

14:16.940 --> 14:19.818
my people always know who I'm seeing.

14:19.900 --> 14:21.174
You think of Mimi.

14:21.260 --> 14:23.410
The kiddies.

14:23.500 --> 14:27.379
You put your pride
in your pocket, big man.

14:27.460 --> 14:32.011
Very bad trouble
is only a wee phone call away.

14:59.980 --> 15:02.130
SOBS

15:17.180 --> 15:20.058
That... is executive transport?

15:22.540 --> 15:26.613
Two minutes in business and you've
already lost your one customer.

15:26.700 --> 15:29.498
- Congratulations(!)
- What?

15:29.580 --> 15:32.617
I wanted something
incon-fucking-spicuous.

15:34.700 --> 15:37.897
Not a mobile poof's palace!

15:37.980 --> 15:40.972
Fucking joke.

15:43.660 --> 15:46.094
I think it's cute,
if it's any consolation.

15:47.700 --> 15:52.330
Jesus, Mickey. I was just trying
to be nice. You're so desperate.

15:52.420 --> 15:55.537
- I've got a date!
- Oh, I take it all back.

15:56.820 --> 16:00.574
Sorry. I would've come in on it
with you, but Paddy's rates are...

16:00.660 --> 16:03.128
You'll go tits-up
trying to pay him back.

16:03.220 --> 16:07.498
He's not a charity. He's got a...
Where you off?

16:07.580 --> 16:08.535
School.

16:08.620 --> 16:11.453
- What for?
- Checking out one of the teachers.

16:11.540 --> 16:13.849
Hot for cock. But who isn't?

16:14.980 --> 16:18.211
Well, I was gonna offer you a lift,
but you can walk.

16:18.300 --> 16:21.337
It's a bit pink for me anyway.
I'm not that out.

16:24.100 --> 16:26.091
It's "fuss-chia"!

16:30.900 --> 16:34.449
It was a judgement call and I may -
may - have erred in that judgement.

16:34.540 --> 16:37.577
But you have to remember who he is,
the little piece of scum!

16:37.660 --> 16:40.458
I wanted to saw his ugly fucking
head off! But I couldn't.

16:52.260 --> 16:53.488
I'm sorry.

16:53.580 --> 16:54.808
I've let you down.

16:54.900 --> 16:58.176
- What did he want?
- Dunno yet.

16:58.260 --> 17:02.538
We didn't get round to it.
I've got to meet him again later.

17:02.620 --> 17:05.088
Gave you time off to come after me.
Very good of him.

17:05.180 --> 17:07.136
What do you think
when you look at me?

17:07.220 --> 17:08.368
What?

17:08.460 --> 17:09.575
What do you see?

17:12.339 --> 17:14.012
I see my fabulous wife.

17:14.099 --> 17:15.499
The mother of my children.

17:15.579 --> 17:18.810
The woman who I love and adore
more than the very world.

17:18.900 --> 17:20.970
You don't notice
I've kept me baby weight?

17:21.060 --> 17:23.449
I don't care about that.

17:23.540 --> 17:26.531
Prove it. Fuck me. Fuck me now.

17:26.619 --> 17:29.134
Christ, Mi. You know,
this fucking hernia. I can't.

17:29.220 --> 17:32.974
- You haven't slipped me one for months.
- Since I've had this.

17:33.060 --> 17:35.130
It's printed in your eyes!
You've stopped fancying me!

17:35.220 --> 17:37.654
- Never!
- You're the same as him!

17:37.740 --> 17:39.492
Me and that twat!

17:39.580 --> 17:41.059
Mimi!

17:41.140 --> 17:43.700
Every curve. Straight from the angels.

17:43.780 --> 17:46.533
I know what you think. What you see!

17:46.620 --> 17:50.852
I do not! Would never, ever
think of you as fat!

17:50.940 --> 17:53.579
What did you fucking say?

17:53.660 --> 17:56.936
I don't think of you as fat.

17:57.020 --> 18:02.890
I can't believe you used
the fucking "F" word in my presence!

18:02.980 --> 18:05.016
Bumble? Easy there!

18:05.100 --> 18:06.931
Calm down!

18:07.020 --> 18:08.976
Why don't you kill me?

18:09.060 --> 18:11.096
It'd be easier to take!

18:12.460 --> 18:16.135
You homeless bastard!

18:28.900 --> 18:30.856
Oh, fuck! What's up?

18:30.940 --> 18:34.535
Nowt. I hope. So what d'you reckon, then?

18:34.620 --> 18:36.497
Not exactly Alan Titwank, are you?

18:36.580 --> 18:39.617
Not used it for cutting wood before,
have I? Takes practice.

18:39.700 --> 18:42.294
It's a saw, you toss.
What else is it for?

18:42.380 --> 18:45.611
If I told you that, Norma,
I'd have to waste your arse.

18:45.700 --> 18:48.089
I'm not scared of you.
I'm not scared of...

18:48.180 --> 18:50.569
A mouse! A mouse, a mouse!

18:50.660 --> 18:53.333
- A mouse! A mouse! A mouse!
- You bastard!

19:01.140 --> 19:03.700
- Why've you got the best bed?
- I own it.

19:03.780 --> 19:06.010
I'll have the bed I want.

19:06.100 --> 19:07.977
What's wrong with one of the flats?

19:08.060 --> 19:09.015
You wouldn't want your old man

19:09.100 --> 19:12.615
hanging around in one of them
cruddy rat-holes, would you?

19:13.740 --> 19:14.809
I've got a date later.

19:14.900 --> 19:16.936
Well, I won't try and join in.

19:17.020 --> 19:20.092
I can't! Not with the old...

19:22.060 --> 19:25.848
It won't be long.
Your ma's totally gone off her nut.

19:25.940 --> 19:27.896
It's a woman thing. Temporary.

19:29.020 --> 19:31.454
She'll keep a couple of days, won't she?

19:31.540 --> 19:32.734
Who?

19:32.820 --> 19:34.412
The slut! Your date?

19:41.540 --> 19:43.019
Not that one!

19:50.820 --> 19:52.412
A present!

19:52.500 --> 19:54.092
That'll spur her into sense.

19:54.180 --> 19:56.774
A special one.

19:56.860 --> 19:59.169
- Start the Twat-mobile, Twat-man.
- We need petrol.

19:59.260 --> 20:00.659
Well, get some!

20:02.500 --> 20:06.573
Oh, fucker! No, no, no,
you should be careful with it.

20:06.660 --> 20:08.935
You know I am a veg. Stop it!

20:09.020 --> 20:09.930
Me snake isn't.

20:10.020 --> 20:11.817
You've got a snake?

20:11.900 --> 20:13.299
Python.

20:13.380 --> 20:17.089
Oh. Oh, I used to have an iguana.

20:17.180 --> 20:20.490
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

20:20.580 --> 20:22.696
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

20:24.020 --> 20:25.214
Forgive us?

20:38.140 --> 20:41.257
I've never been right about food
and all that shite.

20:41.340 --> 20:42.819
It doesn't matter to Dad.

20:42.900 --> 20:46.688
It does.
Matters to everybody. Matters to me.

20:46.780 --> 20:49.374
You could lose weight
if you really wanted to.

20:50.620 --> 20:53.498
Weren't any fat people
came out of concentration camps.

20:53.580 --> 20:55.775
No, they all looked like you.

20:55.860 --> 20:58.135
- Fuck off.
- You fuck off.

21:02.860 --> 21:04.293
Sorry.

21:04.380 --> 21:06.530
Yeah.

21:06.620 --> 21:09.180
Sorry.

21:09.260 --> 21:11.820
- You think it's cos I've no willpower.
- I never said that.

21:11.900 --> 21:15.290
Food, looks, weight.
Blight of my life.

21:15.380 --> 21:18.816
If you're an alcoholic, you stop
drinking. You can't stop eating!

21:18.900 --> 21:21.289
It's always fucked me up!
Always there!

21:21.380 --> 21:24.133
And how many times have you
heard me mention it to you?

21:24.220 --> 21:26.336
How many times have you heard me moan

21:26.420 --> 21:29.412
about my arse or my looks?
Never! You've never heard it!

21:29.500 --> 21:33.015
Because I was determined never to
pass all that shit onto my daughter!

21:33.100 --> 21:36.331
And I haven't. That's willpower!

21:40.020 --> 21:43.171
I knew it'd drive my Paddy away one day.

21:43.260 --> 21:45.216
It hasn't. You told him to go.

21:45.300 --> 21:47.894
I don't need a man
who wants me outta habit.

21:47.980 --> 21:49.971
I need a man who fucking wants me.

21:52.020 --> 21:53.373
He's stopped.

21:54.460 --> 21:55.654
He can't...

21:55.740 --> 21:58.891
I'm starvin'. Is there any of
them double choccy chips left?

21:58.980 --> 22:03.735
All I've got left of my marriage
is little Leslie here.

22:04.860 --> 22:07.533
- S'not really serious, is it?
- (Go!)

22:07.620 --> 22:09.019
All right.

22:11.340 --> 22:12.773
I'll help, Mum.

22:12.860 --> 22:16.648
You can lose weight.

22:16.740 --> 22:21.939
I don't want to stop drinking or eating

22:22.020 --> 22:24.136
or do any exercise.

22:27.300 --> 22:28.892
Do a diary.

22:28.980 --> 22:32.256
Write down everything you eat.
We'll see where we are.

22:33.860 --> 22:35.657
Starting the engine costs a tenner.

22:35.740 --> 22:37.696
I can't hire it out,
cos I've got me dad's

22:37.780 --> 22:41.455
massive pants drying on the heater
and his truss all over the back seat.

22:41.540 --> 22:45.249
Polishing the fucker's the only thing
I can afford to do. Whoa.

22:45.340 --> 22:48.218
You knew it was gonna cost you.
Why'd you buy it?

22:48.300 --> 22:52.373
Somewhere to bring lads back,
not that I can do that now.

22:52.460 --> 22:56.419
And a business.
I'm sick of being the family chimp.

23:01.860 --> 23:04.932
I'm not gonna meet his first payment.

23:05.020 --> 23:06.817
Job going in the pub?

23:06.900 --> 23:08.049
- No chance.
- There must be.

23:08.140 --> 23:12.213
I'm not having you feeling me up
every time there's a quiet patch.

23:12.300 --> 23:14.814
- I wouldn't.
- No, Mickey. No.

23:20.180 --> 23:21.135
How was sir?

23:21.220 --> 23:22.858
Keen as.

23:22.940 --> 23:24.851
You're joking?

23:24.940 --> 23:26.373
I'm seeing him tonight.

23:29.620 --> 23:30.769
It's a bit pink, in't it, mate?!

23:30.860 --> 23:32.498
It's not pink!

23:35.860 --> 23:38.579
All right, mate, how's it hangin'?

23:38.660 --> 23:41.049
Not good. Not good.

23:41.140 --> 23:43.734
She's holding this one against me.
Really is.

23:43.820 --> 23:45.856
And I don't know
how to live without her.

23:45.940 --> 23:48.374
Well, you could take my advice.

23:48.460 --> 23:51.372
Drink through it.

23:51.460 --> 23:54.338
You gettin' 'em in?

23:54.420 --> 23:56.650
Usual, Frank?

23:56.740 --> 23:58.890
Get us a chaser too.

23:58.980 --> 24:00.891
Good to see you.

24:02.220 --> 24:04.131
Cold Guinness, angel.

24:04.220 --> 24:07.895
So, let's chat and sort this business.

24:15.900 --> 24:19.813
You've splashed out on that,
haven't you? Good job you're minted.

24:19.900 --> 24:22.175
I am compared to someone
who's got fuck-all.

24:24.540 --> 24:27.816
Well, I know you're all right,
cos sure you've been dealing off

24:27.900 --> 24:31.575
my best patches while
I've been rotting away inside.

24:31.660 --> 24:34.857
Only an idiot could
lose money on them ones.

24:34.940 --> 24:38.057
And you're not an idiot, are you, Paddy?

24:40.220 --> 24:42.529
Are you an idiot?

24:45.100 --> 24:48.251
I'm only joking you. If I wanted
to post some lead up your arse,

24:48.340 --> 24:50.774
you'd be snuggling your colon by now.

24:55.140 --> 24:58.337
What, fuck's sake! What?

24:58.420 --> 24:59.853
It's not still Mimi, is it?

24:59.940 --> 25:00.895
Sure, that's all sorted out!

25:02.500 --> 25:06.971
Let's not fall out
over a few pounds, eh?

25:08.140 --> 25:12.019
Specially not the ones on your...
your old lady's arse.

25:12.980 --> 25:14.971
Fucking little fuck!

25:15.060 --> 25:19.019
Yeah, that's fucking smart, that.
Very fucking intelligent,

25:19.100 --> 25:21.898
you small-time fuck.

25:21.980 --> 25:25.859
When you want to die? When I
go home or when I don't go home?

25:25.940 --> 25:28.135
Your choice.

25:29.780 --> 25:31.008
Oh, this your diary?

25:32.740 --> 25:35.129
That's all right. Biscuits?

25:38.740 --> 25:40.219
We need a professional.

25:40.300 --> 25:44.612
No. I've tried everything.
I'm beyond help.

25:44.700 --> 25:46.292
Hypnosis.

25:46.380 --> 25:49.099
It's not working. It's not.

25:49.180 --> 25:51.774
Kept waking up with
marshmallows in me hair.

25:51.860 --> 25:55.250
Turned me into an unconscious
sleep-eater. Tried exercise.

25:55.340 --> 25:57.649
<i>...ln time</i>

25:57.740 --> 26:01.858
<i>Only takes a moment to feel all right</i>

26:01.940 --> 26:05.216
<i>Get fresh at the weekend...</i>

26:05.300 --> 26:07.768
Gave me a raging appetite.
I put weight on.

26:07.860 --> 26:12.536
Only time I lost weight was in prison.
Nothing else works.

26:12.620 --> 26:13.894
I can help.

26:13.980 --> 26:15.936
No, you can't.

26:16.020 --> 26:18.454
I'll never be thin.

26:18.540 --> 26:22.419
Never be... desirable again.

26:22.500 --> 26:24.252
Got to face what I am.

26:24.340 --> 26:26.979
I'm a bulimic who can't stand vomit.

26:27.060 --> 26:28.573
We can try.

26:28.660 --> 26:31.049
No, Mandy, love.

26:31.140 --> 26:32.937
I am fat.

26:33.020 --> 26:35.488
I'm a fat fuck.

26:35.580 --> 26:39.129
I'm a fucking fat fucker.

26:41.740 --> 26:43.458
Where did these come from?

26:43.540 --> 26:45.815
Mandy's mum give 'em us.

26:45.900 --> 26:48.334
(Carl) You trying to show us up?

26:48.420 --> 26:49.375
Me?

26:49.460 --> 26:52.099
Bezz saw you at school.
Sniffing round Scotty.

26:52.180 --> 26:54.011
He didn't see that.
We were having a goss.

26:54.100 --> 26:55.374
I know what you were doing.

26:55.460 --> 26:57.052
I thought you were
coo-ell with the gay thing?

26:57.140 --> 26:59.779
That's got nothing to do with this.
It's school, lan. I get taught by him.

26:59.860 --> 27:04.297
He were all over us.
"Very good, Carl. Top of the class."

27:04.380 --> 27:06.018
I looked a right twat in front of Sarah.

27:06.100 --> 27:08.898
- Well, you tipped me off.
- He's my teacher!

27:08.980 --> 27:11.540
So what? I'll see who I like.

27:11.620 --> 27:12.655
Debbie, love.

27:12.740 --> 27:14.776
Can I squeeze these
into your cupboard?

27:14.860 --> 27:17.852
There's absolutely no space
in that teensy room of ours.

27:17.940 --> 27:19.089
(Debbie) What?

27:20.700 --> 27:24.613
Leslie? Leslie?

27:24.700 --> 27:27.134
Leslie? Come to Mummy.

27:27.220 --> 27:29.575
I can't find her anywhere.

27:29.660 --> 27:31.651
<i>Leslie.</i> A he.

27:31.740 --> 27:35.050
Well, a leg of lamb's
missing off the side as well.

27:35.140 --> 27:36.334
You didn't snaffle it, did you?

27:36.420 --> 27:38.092
You cheeky bastard!

27:38.180 --> 27:40.694
Leslie'll have had it.

27:40.780 --> 27:42.611
He'll be back when he's hungry.

27:42.700 --> 27:45.089
Don't throw me out. Don't!

27:45.180 --> 27:48.934
I've got something for you.
Come with me. Come on.

27:49.020 --> 27:50.453
Mimi!

27:57.380 --> 28:00.099
< Oh!

28:00.180 --> 28:02.740
Oh! Nice one, Norma.

28:06.220 --> 28:08.097
Out again.

28:11.020 --> 28:14.376
Here you are. Come on.

28:14.460 --> 28:15.893
Din-dins, Butch!

28:19.860 --> 28:21.373
He won't take it.

28:21.460 --> 28:24.816
- Maybes he's not hungry?
- He should be. Here, lift the bed up.

28:27.260 --> 28:29.330
Look at that.

28:29.420 --> 28:32.696
- It looks like he's...
- What?

28:34.220 --> 28:35.369
It's the dog.

28:35.460 --> 28:38.770
It's me mum's dog. <i>He's</i> had it...

28:38.860 --> 28:40.930
Oh...

28:41.020 --> 28:44.808
Oh, don't go off on one.
You don't know for sure.

28:49.540 --> 28:51.258
OK. Now you know for sure.

28:51.340 --> 28:53.695
I'm toast! I'm dead!

28:53.780 --> 28:56.931
I'm totally fucking dead!

29:13.940 --> 29:16.170
That's how much I love you.

29:16.260 --> 29:19.809
- What've you done?
- He's for you.

29:19.900 --> 29:23.131
What do you want me
to do with your gift?

29:23.220 --> 29:27.099
Are you losing your fucking mind
as well as your touch?

29:27.180 --> 29:29.774
It's not about him.

29:29.860 --> 29:31.976
It's about you and me. It's about me.

29:34.180 --> 29:36.774
I can't believe you'd do
something like that.

29:38.420 --> 29:40.331
What've you done, Paddy?

29:49.580 --> 29:51.536
Piss flaps!

29:51.620 --> 29:53.133
We are neck-high.

29:53.220 --> 29:54.699
We? Where's the "we" come from?

29:54.780 --> 29:57.010
It's nowt to do with me.

29:57.100 --> 29:58.818
I did help with your fence.

29:58.900 --> 30:00.572
Howay then!

30:00.660 --> 30:02.173
Okey-dokey, Einstein.

30:02.260 --> 30:03.693
Plan?

30:09.340 --> 30:11.456
Get another dog.
Hope she doesn't notice.

30:11.540 --> 30:14.338
I mean, she's had it no time.
They all look the same.

30:14.420 --> 30:18.208
- Do they?
- Aye. They all look like Mimi.

30:18.300 --> 30:21.019
You should be more sympathetic.
She's got body issues.

30:21.100 --> 30:23.898
Oh, who hasn't?
She should get over herself.

30:23.980 --> 30:26.255
GIBBERS

30:26.340 --> 30:28.774
Pathetic. You're as bad as mum.

30:28.860 --> 30:31.249
I didn't mean that.

30:31.340 --> 30:34.252
What's going on, baby-cakes?

30:34.340 --> 30:37.173
It's the money you owe Dad.

30:37.260 --> 30:38.852
I can't say.

30:38.940 --> 30:40.692
How much interest is he charging?

30:40.780 --> 30:42.532
Let go...

30:42.620 --> 30:43.769
I can't tell. Argh!

30:44.700 --> 30:46.611
The usual rate!

30:48.260 --> 30:49.739
I can't afford it.

30:52.420 --> 30:54.456
He's gonna break me legs...

30:56.060 --> 30:57.493
...again.

31:03.020 --> 31:04.453
Two more 'ere, Karen.

31:10.540 --> 31:13.008
Oh, still got the girl trouble?

31:14.980 --> 31:16.493
I'm lost.

31:18.460 --> 31:21.577
Without her, I'm lost.

31:21.660 --> 31:25.494
I've done something stupid
and there's no way out.

31:25.580 --> 31:28.219
Yeah, there's plenty more fish
in the sea, you know,

31:28.300 --> 31:31.098
get straight back on the horse...
All that jon-bobbins.

31:31.180 --> 31:34.490
You know, Frank, I've been thinking.

31:34.580 --> 31:37.617
What's worse
than being owed something?

31:38.740 --> 31:41.971
- House fire? Cluster bomb?
- Owing someone.

31:42.060 --> 31:44.528
See, I owe you

31:44.620 --> 31:47.930
and it's beginning to gnaw at me.
Understand?

31:49.540 --> 31:50.859
Yeah.

31:50.940 --> 31:53.056
So I want to pay you in full.

31:53.140 --> 31:55.290
Discharge my debt. Back to quits.

31:55.380 --> 31:58.736
Would that be acceptable?
If I asked nicely?

32:00.660 --> 32:03.777
Uh... Yeah, s'pose so.

32:03.860 --> 32:06.294
Good.

32:12.620 --> 32:14.929
Two mind.

32:15.020 --> 32:16.453
Not one.

32:21.820 --> 32:24.095
Couldn't lend us a score, could you?
I'm down to bare bones...

32:24.180 --> 32:25.169
Shh!

32:33.380 --> 32:35.940
How're we gonna
dig our way outta this?

32:37.660 --> 32:39.616
Easy. Just...

32:39.700 --> 32:42.851
He can't let you go.

32:42.940 --> 32:46.728
And he can't kill me
or keep me here.

32:46.820 --> 32:51.018
No word of a lie, my people
do know where I've gone.

32:53.580 --> 32:57.368
I am truly sorry for what I said...

32:58.780 --> 33:01.578
...but if I don't turn up soon,
then there's going to be some...

33:01.660 --> 33:04.413
sick violence.

33:04.500 --> 33:05.694
Really sick.

33:08.220 --> 33:12.179
Let me go, kid.

33:13.420 --> 33:16.173
Do it now
and there'll be no comeback.

33:16.260 --> 33:19.809
No grudges, no hard feelings.
Nothing.

33:19.900 --> 33:21.333
Guarantee?

33:21.420 --> 33:22.853
My word.

33:25.580 --> 33:26.535
That it?

33:29.380 --> 33:31.211
After what we had?!

33:34.340 --> 33:36.490
You know you can trust me.

33:39.180 --> 33:43.332
I've only ever had
the highest regard for you.

33:45.780 --> 33:49.409
You were a desert island fuck for me.

33:51.460 --> 33:54.611
You were nearly my Paddy.

33:54.700 --> 33:59.137
Could've been you sat in front of
the telly, scratching your balls

33:59.220 --> 34:01.495
and hating me for going to fat.

34:01.580 --> 34:04.048
It would not be like that.

34:05.980 --> 34:07.777
You'd love the inner me?

34:07.860 --> 34:09.578
Of course.

34:11.380 --> 34:13.655
Remember me?

34:15.300 --> 34:18.292
You know I am a man of honour.

34:18.380 --> 34:19.813
Don't you?

34:21.900 --> 34:25.290
Hardly given you a moment's thought,

34:25.380 --> 34:27.416
but I do remember you.

34:29.420 --> 34:31.853
I remember why I dumped you an' all.

34:31.940 --> 34:33.896
You're a lying arsehole.

34:33.980 --> 34:37.210
Ah, Mimi,

34:37.300 --> 34:40.610
you're a fat stupid bitch,
so you are.

34:40.699 --> 34:43.851
That was your last chance to
save your limp-dicked Paddy.

34:43.940 --> 34:47.649
Won't be getting a hard-on with his
blood all over the fucking pavement!

34:47.739 --> 34:48.809
MUFFLED CRIES

34:52.659 --> 34:57.290
MUFFLED CRIES

34:57.380 --> 34:59.177
(Muffled) See you later.

35:04.500 --> 35:05.455
THUD!

35:08.020 --> 35:08.975
What're you doing?

35:12.700 --> 35:16.488
- Falling over.
- What time is it?

35:16.580 --> 35:20.016
Where've you been?

35:20.100 --> 35:22.216
You've seen him, haven't you?

35:23.780 --> 35:24.769
None of yours.

35:24.860 --> 35:28.216
I asked you not to. You've gone
and shagged him, haven't you?

35:28.300 --> 35:29.528
You didn't ask me anything.

35:29.620 --> 35:31.770
You're a selfish wanker.

35:31.860 --> 35:33.578
Oh, cock off, pig tits.

35:33.660 --> 35:35.537
- What're you talking about?
- (Both) Put that out!

35:35.620 --> 35:39.693
What've I told you?
No more fires!

35:41.460 --> 35:43.178
Carl?

35:46.460 --> 35:47.893
BARKING

35:47.980 --> 35:49.971
It's exactly the same.

35:50.060 --> 35:52.290
Apart from personality.
The vicious little twat.

35:52.380 --> 35:55.338
(Norma) Shall we leave it in
the yard for her to find?

35:55.420 --> 35:59.891
Yeah. Just got to put this on,
pierce its ear and we're done.

35:59.980 --> 36:01.095
Pierce its ear?

36:01.180 --> 36:02.613
Yeah! She put an earring in.

36:04.660 --> 36:06.890
Which is gay side?

36:06.980 --> 36:07.935
Gay side?

36:08.020 --> 36:10.614
Yeah, she won't want a gay dog,
will she?

36:10.700 --> 36:12.930
What's gayer than a fucking air dog?

36:14.460 --> 36:15.734
HE SCREAMS

36:15.820 --> 36:17.412
Perfect(!)

36:19.980 --> 36:21.572
...I like you too.

36:21.660 --> 36:24.493
- Do you want a brew?
- Stop nosing about, Debs.

36:24.580 --> 36:26.457
I'm not. I'm making one.

36:26.540 --> 36:27.734
I'm all right, ta.

36:27.820 --> 36:29.378
Mr Scott?

36:29.460 --> 36:31.815
You all right, sir?

36:31.900 --> 36:34.494
Didn't know you two were a couple.

36:34.580 --> 36:35.854
What're you doing?

36:35.940 --> 36:37.339
You left this.

36:37.420 --> 36:38.455
It's not mine.

36:38.540 --> 36:40.053
Isn't it?

36:40.140 --> 36:41.971
Oh, no. >

36:42.060 --> 36:43.334
Now it looks like I've come up with

36:43.420 --> 36:45.251
an obviously transparent excuse
just to see you, doesn't it?

36:46.380 --> 36:48.371
I wouldn't leave your car out there.

36:48.460 --> 36:51.258
(Mr Scott) Half a mo'.
I've got your homework.

36:52.540 --> 36:56.533
That... was relatively inventive, Carl.

36:56.620 --> 36:59.771
And you should try copying Carl, Sarah.

36:59.860 --> 37:02.055
Instead of Dave Martin's
hopeless effort,

37:02.140 --> 37:05.291
which is the highway to a C minus.

37:05.380 --> 37:06.574
I'd better be going.

37:06.660 --> 37:08.378
- What now?
- Yeah.

37:10.100 --> 37:11.453
- I'll call you.
- Whatever.

37:13.220 --> 37:15.211
Oh, piss!

37:16.340 --> 37:17.932
You got the right sex, didn't you?

37:18.020 --> 37:19.453
It was a dog, not a bitch?

37:22.820 --> 37:24.890
Leslie!

37:24.980 --> 37:26.459
Look what I found.

37:28.780 --> 37:31.499
Oh, hello, gorgeous.

37:31.580 --> 37:32.615
Where's his tattoo?

37:35.220 --> 37:39.259
Oh, for fuck's sake. How we
supposed to fucking know that?

37:39.340 --> 37:40.614
What was it?

37:42.660 --> 37:43.854
Who did it?

37:43.940 --> 37:45.089
Inky Bob.

37:45.180 --> 37:46.215
Inky Bob?

37:46.300 --> 37:47.938
You know, the one with the...

37:49.140 --> 37:52.337
Well, that explains it.
Doesn't use proper ink.

37:52.420 --> 37:54.012
Look at that.

37:54.100 --> 37:55.328
There's nowt there.

37:55.420 --> 37:57.980
Exactly. Guess who did mine?

37:58.060 --> 38:00.415
Inky fucking Bob.

38:00.500 --> 38:05.494
That fucking... That fucking Inky Bob!
Please tell me you didn't go to see him!

38:05.580 --> 38:08.378
Totally faded. Fraud!

38:10.300 --> 38:12.131
(Mimi) Is everyone a bastard?

38:12.220 --> 38:13.972
DOOR SLAMS

38:14.060 --> 38:15.732
(Patrick) You're wasting your time.

38:15.820 --> 38:17.970
Bank won't give him
the steam off its piss.

38:18.060 --> 38:19.812
Never mind a three grand loan.

38:19.900 --> 38:21.413
Will if I'm with him.

38:21.500 --> 38:23.092
Making sure he gives his real name.

38:23.180 --> 38:26.456
Are we setting off?
Or can we kill the engine?

38:26.540 --> 38:28.132
Petrol and that...

38:28.220 --> 38:29.414
Are we going anywhere?

38:29.500 --> 38:33.129
I'm not helping you with mum
if you don't do this for Mickey.

38:36.420 --> 38:39.617
Turn the engine off. Come back here.

38:39.700 --> 38:42.339
You really push it with
this heir apparent bollocks.

38:44.780 --> 38:47.692
DOOR HANDLE CLUNKS

38:47.780 --> 38:49.975
What sort of a fucking car?!

38:56.180 --> 38:59.889
Well, done, setting up the business,
son. I'm proud of you.

38:59.980 --> 39:02.778
I'm cancelling the loan.

39:02.860 --> 39:04.054
It's a gift.

39:08.260 --> 39:09.693
Oh, Dad.

39:12.180 --> 39:16.890
I'll speak to her. It's all in her head.
We hate you being apart.

39:16.980 --> 39:18.208
Hate you being in here, too.

39:19.220 --> 39:21.893
But that's not the main reason.

39:25.020 --> 39:27.295
Is it Dad's fault you got bigger?

39:27.380 --> 39:28.449
Has he been cramming the pies in?

39:28.540 --> 39:31.259
No. He's never even mentioned
your weight.

39:31.340 --> 39:33.490
You've chucked him out
cos some other bloke said it.

39:33.580 --> 39:36.697
All he wants is to be back with you.
I've seen him.

39:36.780 --> 39:38.259
He may as well have his arms off.

39:38.340 --> 39:40.490
He's better off without me.

39:40.580 --> 39:42.730
Oh, don't whine.

39:42.820 --> 39:48.053
I live with this every day.
This layer of lard has ruined my life.

39:48.140 --> 39:51.496
And now it's ruining Paddy's, too.
He's in a mess cos of me...

39:51.580 --> 39:53.889
and my weight.

39:53.980 --> 39:57.017
- I can fix it.
- Gonna have him back?

39:58.380 --> 40:00.496
I'm going to fix it.

40:08.620 --> 40:10.690
What're you doing?

40:10.780 --> 40:12.418
Looking for something.

40:12.500 --> 40:15.412
For Leslie to chew.

40:15.500 --> 40:17.377
I've things I need to do.
I might be going away.

40:17.460 --> 40:20.020
I've messed up,
but I've found a way out for your dad.

40:20.100 --> 40:23.649
For everybody for the best.

40:23.740 --> 40:26.015
Look after him. For me.

40:26.100 --> 40:28.056
He was your dad's last present.

40:28.140 --> 40:30.654
Mum? Mum, where're you going?

40:32.260 --> 40:35.730
Dad, Dad! You got to go find Mum.

40:35.820 --> 40:38.095
- Why?
- She's just acting weird.

40:38.180 --> 40:40.933
- The gun's gone missing.
- Which gun?

40:41.020 --> 40:45.411
The one in t'wardrobe.
You don't think she's gonna?

40:46.540 --> 40:48.178
She'd never do that.

40:49.380 --> 40:52.258
Shit!

40:52.340 --> 40:54.092
It's not that bad.

40:54.180 --> 40:58.219
He's just been chucked. He's gonna
get the piss ripped out of him.

40:58.300 --> 41:00.894
You've been an arsehole, lan.
It is that bad.

41:00.980 --> 41:02.732
You told me someone fancied me.

41:02.820 --> 41:08.816
I followed it up. Hey, if I told you,
I don't know, Gaby Patterson fancied you,

41:08.900 --> 41:10.379
you'd be straight round.

41:10.460 --> 41:13.611
She's not a fucking teacher!
It's not cos you're gay, lan,

41:13.700 --> 41:16.055
it's cos it's weird. It'd be the same
if Debbie went out with him.

41:16.140 --> 41:18.415
No. That'd be worse.

41:18.500 --> 41:20.570
Debbie, I've just been in your room

41:20.660 --> 41:23.049
and I couldn't help but noticing your bed.

41:23.140 --> 41:26.098
You think you're getting my room?
Just try it.

41:26.180 --> 41:28.569
Cos your first night will be your last!

41:28.660 --> 41:31.299
I'll slit your throat!
You're never sleeping in my room!

41:31.380 --> 41:36.329
Never! Cos it's my room!
And you can't have it!

41:36.420 --> 41:39.014
I couldn't help noticing
your bed was broken.

41:39.100 --> 41:41.819
So I had thought we could get you
a new one out the catalogue.

41:41.900 --> 41:46.416
- I've already ordered you new curtains.
- So you don't want my room?

41:46.500 --> 41:48.297
No.

41:48.380 --> 41:52.851
Oh, OK, then, I'll have a new bed. Ta.

42:08.420 --> 42:10.570
There is a way out of it.

42:10.660 --> 42:12.730
And it solves all our problems.

42:12.820 --> 42:15.971
Fat bitch shoots you.

42:16.060 --> 42:17.618
I hold me hands up.

42:17.700 --> 42:22.330
A crime of passion.
You screwed me over years back

42:22.420 --> 42:24.297
and I've never got over it.

42:24.380 --> 42:27.099
Paddy isn't to blame,

42:27.180 --> 42:29.330
he gets to move on,

42:29.420 --> 42:32.617
without the hindrance of a wife
he no longer wants.

42:32.700 --> 42:36.295
Not many wives would do that
for their husbands.

42:36.380 --> 42:38.974
Always said I was one in a million,
didn't I?

42:39.060 --> 42:40.971
Put that down!

42:41.060 --> 42:43.972
Put... that... down!

42:47.100 --> 42:49.136
You trying to get me off the hook, are you?

42:49.220 --> 42:55.170
Shoot him and I'm an accessory.
We both go down. What's the plan now?

42:57.900 --> 42:59.697
CRIES

42:59.780 --> 43:01.816
How did this happen?

43:05.300 --> 43:07.814
It's totally fucking obvious I love you.

43:07.900 --> 43:12.291
- I don't want to be just friends.
- Neither do I.

43:12.380 --> 43:14.848
You're not seeing me!

43:14.940 --> 43:19.650
Look at me!
How could you fancy me?!

43:19.740 --> 43:22.334
So you're carrying a bit of weight.

43:22.420 --> 43:24.172
Fuck, bollocks to that.

43:24.260 --> 43:26.694
I don't care!

43:30.900 --> 43:33.653
I do fancy you.

43:37.100 --> 43:38.613
Fuck this.

43:38.700 --> 43:41.214
Look what he's done to us.
He's got to choke.

43:41.300 --> 43:46.090
- No. They'll kill you. I'll do it.
- And what will I do without you, huh?

43:48.460 --> 43:52.931
- You're my foundation.
- I'm doing it for you.

43:53.020 --> 43:54.612
I'm doing it for you.

43:54.700 --> 43:57.692
MUMBLES

44:00.620 --> 44:04.169
- Don't let this madness ruin everything.
- I'm sorry.

44:04.260 --> 44:07.297
Christ, Mi-mo, me too.

44:07.380 --> 44:09.371
Come home.

44:21.660 --> 44:24.220
That the gun from the wardrobe?

44:24.300 --> 44:26.370
- Yeah.
- It's hot.

44:43.020 --> 44:45.454
Pull the trigger
and we're all going home.

44:45.540 --> 44:49.897
- You're framing me?
- Our protection.

44:49.980 --> 44:52.414
We're in shite if we kill you
and shite if we don't.

44:58.060 --> 45:02.975
Security guard had his ear
whacked off with that. Recent, too.

45:03.060 --> 45:05.255
After you got out.

45:05.340 --> 45:08.696
They'd be made up
to find your prints on it.

45:10.140 --> 45:13.894
Should be good for ten with your record.
Not that you'd blink.

45:13.980 --> 45:18.053
By the way,
what did you want to see me about?

45:19.860 --> 45:21.373
I'm retiring.

45:21.460 --> 45:23.735
Off to Cyprus.

45:23.820 --> 45:28.177
Wanted to sell you one of my patches
to go with the ones you've stole.

45:29.300 --> 45:31.814
Think I'll ask somebody else.

45:39.780 --> 45:41.008
All done.

45:41.100 --> 45:43.455
And no-one got hurt.

45:49.020 --> 45:51.773
Home.

46:00.420 --> 46:02.695
I'm sorry.

46:02.780 --> 46:05.010
That were totally fucking...

46:05.100 --> 46:07.170
I'm sorry!

46:14.140 --> 46:16.096
I didn't like being told what to do by you.

46:18.580 --> 46:20.855
I'm a dickhead. Will that do?

46:20.940 --> 46:22.612
Don't go overboard.

46:23.540 --> 46:25.178
Am I forgiven?

46:25.260 --> 46:26.329
You did tip me off about Gaby Patterson.

46:26.420 --> 46:28.217
How funny!

46:29.700 --> 46:31.258
What?

46:31.340 --> 46:32.693
You told me she fancied me.

46:32.780 --> 46:34.259
No. I used her as an example.

46:35.420 --> 46:36.853
No way!

46:38.980 --> 46:39.935
She let me feel her tits.

46:40.020 --> 46:42.488
- Nah!
- Straight off.

46:42.580 --> 46:44.855
- So did Mr Scott.
- Did he?!

46:45.700 --> 46:50.091
- Think she'll wank me off next week.
- Mr Scott would definitely wank me off.

46:52.620 --> 46:54.736
You'd better get it out.
He's here now.

46:54.820 --> 46:56.538
Quick. Hide!

46:58.780 --> 47:00.008
I thought you liked him.

47:00.100 --> 47:04.457
What? Course not. He's a teacher!
And he's hairier than a gibbon.

47:04.540 --> 47:06.531
(Carl) A gibbon!

47:13.540 --> 47:16.737
<i>The first time</i>

47:16.820 --> 47:21.689
<i>Ever I saw your face</i>

47:21.780 --> 47:24.977
<i>I thought the sun</i>

47:25.060 --> 47:29.815
<i>Rose in my eyes.</i>

47:31.860 --> 47:33.930
Don't.

47:35.260 --> 47:37.694
Just do me.

47:37.780 --> 47:39.896
Properly.

47:43.420 --> 47:45.376
Lead the way!

47:45.460 --> 47:47.530
THEY LAUGH

47:53.460 --> 47:57.135
(Frank) 'I'll tell you what's
really fucking heroic.

47:57.220 --> 48:00.257
'Waking up in the morning,
putting one foot in front of the other,

48:00.340 --> 48:05.130
'Iooking at the wife and kids
and not topping yourself.'

48:05.220 --> 48:09.054
Oh, my fucking hernia!

48:49.980 --> 48:52.369
Yeah! You're the first person
I've had back here.

48:52.460 --> 48:56.453
In fact, I've been a bit short recently.
I'm desperate for a shag.

48:56.540 --> 48:58.292
Yeah?

49:03.020 --> 49:05.818
Well, why don't we make
something of it, then?

49:10.940 --> 49:13.454
Haven't you got homework to mark?

49:13.540 --> 49:16.100
School day tomorrow, innit?

49:17.220 --> 49:19.290
Long holidays to plan?

49:23.140 --> 49:25.210
Go on, get it down you!
