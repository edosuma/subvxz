they are all very nervous.

14:53.968 --> 14:55.876

What if everything works out?
- Yeah.

1:02:29.321 --> 1:02:30.470
- Well, son...
- How you doing?

1:02:30.489 --> 1:02:32.989
- I'm okay.
How are you?

1:02:33.083 --> 1:02:35.825
- I can wait and earn
to call you dad--that's fine.

1:02:35.978 --> 1:02:37.644
- Yeah, it's like...

1:02:37.737 --> 1:02:38.754
We'll talk in eight weeks.
- Yeah.

1:02:38.981 --> 1:02:40.480
- We'll see.

1:02:40.573 --> 1:02:42.090
But, um, you know,
my biggest concern,

1:02:42.242 --> 1:02:43.650
Of course, as a father is,

1:02:43.668 --> 1:02:44.760
How are you
going to treat my daughter?

1:02:44.987 --> 1:02:46.261
- For sure.

1:02:46.412 --> 1:02:47.411
- I'm putting a lot
of faith and trust

1:02:47.431 --> 1:02:49.172
In this whole process.

1:02:49.266 --> 1:02:51.433
My concern, of course, is, who
is this person going to be?

1:02:51.660 --> 1:02:54.327
Are you a criminal?
Are you a scam artist?

1:02:54.420 --> 1:02:56.605
Are you just, you know,
a bad person?

1:02:56.832 --> 1:02:59.499
No father raises his child
who's close to his child

1:02:59.518 --> 1:03:01.109
And says, "you know what?

1:03:01.261 --> 1:03:03.003
<i> "I think you should grow up</i>
<i> and meet some guy</i>

1:03:03.096 --> 1:03:05.355
<i> That you don't have</i>
<i> any idea about</i>

1:03:05.507 --> 1:03:07.598
And basically you
don't even know his family."

1:03:07.618 --> 1:03:09.676
In an arranged marriage,
you usually know the family.

1:03:09.694 --> 1:03:11.269
<i> We didn't know anybody.</i>

1:03:11.363 --> 1:03:13.013
It's a total leap of faith.

1:03:13.031 --> 1:03:15.181
- I definitely am ready
for something real,

1:03:15.200 --> 1:03:16.291
For something--

1:03:16.518 --> 1:03:18.184
I'm a very loyal
and committed person.

1:03:18.278 --> 1:03:21.037
I know at the end of the day,
we may not agree on everything,

1:03:21.131 --> 1:03:23.706
And I think the important thing
is to hear each other out.

1:03:23.801 --> 1:03:25.616
If I'm just talking over her,
then I'm not listening.

1:03:25.710 --> 1:03:27.877
If you're a good communicator,
it's also very important

1:03:27.971 --> 1:03:29.304
To be a good listener.

1:03:29.455 --> 1:03:30.880
And, like, at the
end of the day--

1:03:30.974 --> 1:03:32.365
- That's what communication
is all about.

1:03:32.458 --> 1:03:33.883

louder than words.

- I am ready to be married.

1:03:35.813 --> 1:03:37.145
- Because it's
going to be easy,

1:03:37.372 --> 1:03:38.721
You're going to go together
on a honeymoon now,

1:03:38.816 --> 1:03:39.873
And that's going to be--

1:03:39.966 --> 1:03:41.483

this is great.

1:03:41.710 --> 1:03:43.134

you're having a good time.

1:03:45.638 --> 1:03:46.880
Yeah, she got a dress.
You got a bunch of rings.

1:03:46.973 --> 1:03:48.882
But life's going
to get in the way.

1:03:48.900 --> 1:03:50.733
Where are you going to live?
What are you going to do?

1:03:50.828 --> 1:03:52.402
We got three dogs.
We're going to do this.

- I agree.

1:03:53.572 --> 1:03:55.146

1:03:55.240 --> 1:03:56.314
- Are you prepared for that?

1:03:56.333 --> 1:03:57.574
Because now
you have another person.

1:03:57.726 --> 1:03:59.576
I mean, life is hard anyway.

1:03:59.670 --> 1:04:03.338
Are you willing to work
on that hard life together?

1:04:03.565 --> 1:04:06.583
