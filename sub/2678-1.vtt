(Marley): Come on, let's go.
Come on, kiddo.

01:26.940 --> 01:29.660
-We're going to have some fun.
-(Cammie): Yeah!

01:29.740 --> 01:33.490
(Marley): You know I'm the best friend
ever. Now get out of here.

01:33.570 --> 01:36.750
-(Renee): Have fun.
-We won't be back till after five, so

01:36.830 --> 01:39.550
-have lots of sex with your husband.
-Marley!

01:39.620 --> 01:43.500
Hot, steamy, unbridled sex.

01:47.880 --> 01:50.600
Thank you. You all have fun.
Be good for Marley.

01:50.670 --> 01:52.600
(Marley): We're gonna be good, Mommy.

01:52.680 --> 01:54.850
-No sugar.
-Course not.

01:54.930 --> 01:58.150
-She said no sugar.
-Love you, Mommy.

01:58.220 --> 02:01.270
Take care.
Have fun with her.

02:01.350 --> 02:03.940
Make that magic happen!

02:04.020 --> 02:06.320
-Ready, baby?
-Yes.

02:06.400 --> 02:09.820
-What are we gonna do today?
-Go get some sugar.

02:09.900 --> 02:11.490
What?! Sugar?

02:11.570 --> 02:15.950
(voice over Marley): If you think
this is what I want out of life,

02:16.030 --> 02:19.960
you know, the whole matrimonial,
maternal fairy tale, you're wrong.

02:20.040 --> 02:23.340
It's not for me and that's okay,
because this idea

02:23.410 --> 02:27.540
that you have to fall in love
in order to live happily ever after

02:27.630 --> 02:29.250
is just not true.

02:34.260 --> 02:36.230
(Marley): Stanley...

02:36.300 --> 02:37.800
Stanley...

02:38.930 --> 02:42.680
you gotta get up, buddy.
I gotta go to work.

02:42.770 --> 02:44.860
Hey!

02:46.100 --> 02:48.820

-Wow!
-You need to watch where you're going.

04:30.250 --> 04:35.010
Hello. Poster child for not mixing
wine with vodka.

04:35.090 --> 04:37.470
You drank twice as much.
How are you okay?

04:37.550 --> 04:39.550
-Are you okay?
-Ohh h.

04:39.630 --> 04:41.260
Are you? Say yes.

04:42.300 --> 04:43.400
Ohhh!

04:51.190 --> 04:56.280
-Glad you could join us. Ready?
-I thought you were doing this.

04:56.360 --> 04:59.580
Okay, why don't we start.
Marley?

05:03.660 --> 05:05.960
-Good morning.
-Morning.

05:06.080 --> 05:09.250
I'm sure this town
has been pitching the hell out of you,

05:09.330 --> 05:11.130
so I won't bother with that.

05:11.250 --> 05:13.800
But I will tell you
that you'll never be number one

05:13.880 --> 05:16.850
as long as your customer base
is 82 percent male.

05:16.920 --> 05:20.680
Yes. Well, women don't buy condoms.

05:20.760 --> 05:24.180
Not yours.

05:24.260 --> 05:28.520
Come on, gentlemen.
As I'm sure you're all painfully aware,

05:28.600 --> 05:33.150
it is women, myself included,
who dictate when, where,

05:33.230 --> 05:37.530
how, with whom and how many times
we're going to have sex.

05:37.610 --> 05:40.950
We can't always count on the man
to have condoms lying around.

05:41.030 --> 05:45.660
So we actually do go buy them
and then we end up in the condom aisle

05:45.740 --> 05:49.120
with a choice.
So which brand do we buy?

05:49.200 --> 05:53.750
Do we buy Trojan, whose very name
conjures the essence of

05:53.830 --> 05:56.590
penetration with protection?

05:56.670 --> 06:00.850
Or do we choose the one
with the skanky-looking girl,

06:00.920 --> 06:02.390
with big tits,

06:02.470 --> 06:06.390
skimpy shorts
and stripper pumps?

06:14.480 --> 06:15.650
I'll keep this one.

06:20.570 --> 06:22.660
-Hey!
-Yay! Hi, baby.

06:22.740 --> 06:26.960
She had them and their condoms
wrapped around her little finger.

06:27.030 --> 06:29.290
-Alright!
-To the youngest, the hottest

06:29.370 --> 06:32.210
vice president
in the history of advertising.

06:35.080 --> 06:37.260
You should think about
buying a house now.

06:37.330 --> 06:40.430
Yeah, why take the time
to stop and smell the roses?

06:40.500 --> 06:44.680
What you need is a big, fat mortgage
like an albatross around your neck.

06:46.300 --> 06:51.810
Okay, in honour of Marley’s
white-trash taste buds we have...

06:51.890 --> 06:54.310
Mac and cheese pizza?

06:54.390 --> 06:57.440
You know what I want
for my birthday? Your metabolism.

06:57.520 --> 07:00.700
I'll trade you my metabolism
for those boobs.

07:00.770 --> 07:03.450
Throw in that necklace
and you've got a deal.

07:03.530 --> 07:05.120
Baby, that's a good trade.

07:05.200 --> 07:08.700
Hey. She's gonna have her own boobs
soon enough.

07:08.780 --> 07:10.750
Way to keep a secret, Marley.

07:11.790 --> 07:14.000
-Are you getting implants?
-No.

07:14.080 --> 07:15.960
-I'm pregnant.
-You're pregnant?

07:16.040 --> 07:18.170
-Cammie's getting a brother.
-Another one.

07:18.250 --> 07:20.550
But we're not ruling out
the implant thing.

07:20.630 --> 07:23.430
-You're disgusting.
-Cheers. To you, Marley.

07:23.510 --> 07:24.800
To us.

07:24.880 --> 07:27.430
-Bye, you guys.
-Good luck out there.

07:27.510 --> 07:32.390
-Congratulations on the new boy.
-May he be happy and healthy.

07:32.470 --> 07:37.230
-And may he have a huge penis.
-Geez! You are just terrible.

07:37.310 --> 07:40.570
-Speaking of terrible...
-Speed down.

07:40.650 --> 07:43.240
-Marley made a booty call.
-Shut up.

07:43.320 --> 07:45.740
-I'm serious, baby.
-Bye, good night.

07:45.820 --> 07:48.160
Good night, Doug.

07:48.240 --> 07:50.330
-Love you.
-Love you.

07:50.410 --> 07:52.910
Hey, Doug. Wanna come over?

07:52.990 --> 07:57.170
Oh, you're coming over.
No, you are coming over.

07:59.670 --> 08:01.890
(Marley): Oh, my God! Oh!

08:03.920 --> 08:04.970
(Marley): Oh!

08:12.140 --> 08:15.890
Mmm, not bad, mister.

08:15.980 --> 08:19.650
Not bad at all.

08:19.730 --> 08:23.200
Oh!

08:23.270 --> 08:26.650
So, does this mean
I actually get to spend the night?

08:27.740 --> 08:31.910
I mean, I love being the first number
on the booty call list, but...

08:33.240 --> 08:34.990
Well, second?

08:36.789 --> 08:38.260
Sure.

08:39.289 --> 08:41.760
What if I want something more?

08:42.960 --> 08:45.050
What if I don't'?

08:50.180 --> 08:51.390
Really?

08:51.470 --> 08:53.890
I thought we made that clear
when we met.

08:53.970 --> 08:58.520
That's what people say at first,
so no one gets hurt.

08:58.600 --> 09:02.900
Not me.

09:06.530 --> 09:11.910
Oh! What? Oh, my goodness.
I love you. I love you.

09:13.070 --> 09:14.580
Real.

09:15.780 --> 09:18.580
That's not real. Got it?
-Yes.

09:18.660 --> 09:22.040
Real. Okay?
Not real.

09:22.120 --> 09:23.630
-Fake.
-Fake.

09:23.710 --> 09:27.210
Silicon Valley. Got it?
You sure?

09:27.300 --> 09:30.470
Here's a little something
to celebrate your promotion.

09:30.550 --> 09:34.770
Thank you, Mommy.
Such a kind mama.

09:39.390 --> 09:41.990
Okay. Let's see.

09:42.060 --> 09:47.070
'Congratulations from your best friends
forever. Renee, Thomas and Cammie.'

09:47.150 --> 09:49.780
Oh, you're so good with words.

09:58.540 --> 10:01.910
Is this the actual gift, or are you
setting me up with him?

10:02.000 --> 10:07.220
The idea is: You take him out
and you, um, put a real man in it.

10:07.290 --> 10:11.270
(Marley laughing)
-What? Like maybe Doug.

10:13.340 --> 10:14.940
-Who?
-Ohhh.

10:15.010 --> 10:17.680
Come on.
We all know he wasn't a keeper.

10:17.760 --> 10:19.810
-Poor Doug.
-No poor Doug.

10:19.890 --> 10:22.190
-Ohhh.
-Thank you.

10:22.270 --> 10:23.990
Thank you.

10:26.230 --> 10:28.780
Could you tell him
that Marley Corbett called?

10:28.860 --> 10:31.410
Yeah, that'd be great.
Bye, bye.

10:34.240 --> 10:36.740
Okay, I gotta say something.

10:36.820 --> 10:40.170
I think this Vice Presidency
is making your tits smaller.

10:40.240 --> 10:41.590
Really?

10:42.620 --> 10:43.960
Yeah.

10:44.040 --> 10:45.460
-Really?
-Hm hum.

10:45.540 --> 10:47.540
-Hey.
-Hey, Rob.

10:48.670 --> 10:53.020
-Think Marley's tits are shrinking?
-Like, right now?

10:53.090 --> 10:56.010
-No, in general.
-Uh, yeah.

10:57.510 --> 11:01.110
-How are we doing on Coffee Land?
-Great. Our favourite so far.

11:01.180 --> 11:04.560
'Drink this dark-flavoured spit
and it'll make you shit.'

11:04.640 --> 11:07.570
-Tell him the others.
-Can't. He has to be across town at 1,

11:07.650 --> 11:10.270
beck here for storyboards at 3
and dinner at 6

11:10.360 --> 11:13.200
and after dinner we have drinks
with the Home Depot.

11:13.280 --> 11:15.830
That's why I love this woman.
I love you.

11:15.900 --> 11:18.370
Jesus. He's running you ragged.

11:19.580 --> 11:22.700
You look-- not so good.

11:22.790 --> 11:27.010
-When did you last see a doctor?
-Does Dr Phil count?

11:36.470 --> 11:38.220
Ow!

11:40.970 --> 11:42.270
Shit.

11:42.350 --> 11:44.440
(Marley): Oh.

11:45.770 --> 11:48.570
You look familiar.

11:48.650 --> 11:52.620
-Have we had sex?
-No, um, I'm sorry.

11:52.690 --> 11:56.370
Never mind.
I was just joking.

11:56.450 --> 12:01.500
-Marley, I'm Dr Goldstein.
-You're Dr-- Goldstein?

12:01.580 --> 12:04.290
-Yes, I'm Jewish, from Mexico.
-No. I mean,

12:04.370 --> 12:07.590
I just expected somebody older,
not so--

12:09.540 --> 12:11.130
young.

12:11.210 --> 12:12.840
Take a seat.

12:17.550 --> 12:19.470
-So, Marley...
-Hmm.

12:19.550 --> 12:24.520
-What seems to be the problem?
-Not so sure. Hence being here.

12:24.600 --> 12:28.480
Look up. So you've been experiencing
some weight loss, right?

12:28.560 --> 12:31.660
-Umm...
-And you had some blood in your stool?

12:32.810 --> 12:35.910
Yes, I've been experiencing

12:35.980 --> 12:38.490
some of that bleeding
you're talking about.

12:38.570 --> 12:43.040
Just lie on your back. I'm gonna
feel around your stomach, okay?

12:43.120 --> 12:45.340
-Just relax.
-Okay.

12:50.170 --> 12:53.090
I'm kind of ticklish,
so don't be a wuss.

12:53.170 --> 12:57.260
Don't get all feather-fing...

13:00.840 --> 13:02.560
Ow!

13:05.260 --> 13:08.640
Okay, Marley,
we're gonna need to run some tests.

13:11.440 --> 13:14.360
-Up! Time.
-Oh, no, no, no.

13:14.440 --> 13:17.280
-Pens.
-There's still two more seconds left.

13:17.360 --> 13:20.330
-What are you doing?
-Down. Pens down.

13:20.400 --> 13:23.120
Is it weird that
I always find the word 'slut'?

13:23.200 --> 13:25.580
Too bad you only get two points
for 'slut'.

13:25.660 --> 13:29.510
Whore gets you three points.

13:29.580 --> 13:32.000
Time.

13:32.080 --> 13:34.840
It's pink juice time.

13:38.670 --> 13:44.480
-Think of it like, like bubble gum urine.
-Yummy! Bottoms up.

13:46.810 --> 13:49.810
Mmm. Uh mmm.

13:53.690 --> 13:56.190
Isn't this stuff supposed
to clean you out?

13:56.270 --> 13:58.030
Maybe you didn't do it right.

13:59.070 --> 14:02.320
How can she not do it right?
She drank it.

14:03.450 --> 14:09.710
Maybe she drank it too fast,
or, I don't know, too slow.

14:11.830 --> 14:15.460
Ooh! Aw!
Yee-ha-ha.

14:15.540 --> 14:17.670
(Peter): Let us know
when it starts working.

14:17.750 --> 14:19.970
(Marley): Oh, my God!

14:21.670 --> 14:24.770
-Good morning, Marley.
-Oh, really.

14:24.840 --> 14:28.520
Is it? I'm about to get a huge camera
stuck up my butt.

14:28.600 --> 14:30.900
So I don't know
if that qualifies as good.

14:30.970 --> 14:35.200
I just need you to sign this document
which states that you understand

14:35.270 --> 14:39.280
all the colonoscopy's risks,
which include heavy bleeding, uh,

14:39.360 --> 14:42.580
infection, perforation, rupture.

14:42.650 --> 14:45.910
On a scale of one to ten,
one being 'never'

14:46.030 --> 14:48.280
and ten being 'happens all the time',

14:48.370 --> 14:51.920
what are the chances of you
rupturing my ass?

14:52.000 --> 14:56.000
Well, not.
The chances are very slim.

14:56.080 --> 15:00.050
It's, uh, more procedural.

15:00.130 --> 15:04.300
Good, well, procedure away,
my friend.

15:04.380 --> 15:05.850
This is gonna be fun.

15:07.010 --> 15:09.930
Would you mind rolling
onto your left side, please.

15:24.190 --> 15:26.790
Thanks.

15:26.860 --> 15:28.580
Wait a minute.

15:29.830 --> 15:35.050
Before we go to whatever base
this is we're going to, um,

15:36.080 --> 15:39.010
shouldn't I know your first name?

15:41.420 --> 15:43.470
Julian.

15:43.550 --> 15:47.800
Julian.

15:50.220 --> 15:52.850
Julian Goldstein.

15:56.890 --> 16:00.490
My hero.

16:21.590 --> 16:23.800
Where the hell am I?

16:38.560 --> 16:41.560
-Hello, Marley.
-Oh, my God.

16:43.770 --> 16:46.530
Wait a minute. Oh, my God.
I mean...

16:47.690 --> 16:49.990
-Are you God?
-Not really.

16:50.070 --> 16:52.290
This is just the way
you wanted to see me.

16:52.370 --> 16:56.500
Well, I love Whoopi,
so that's probably why.

16:56.580 --> 17:00.300
Yeah, me too.
Oh, have a seat.

17:00.370 --> 17:01.970
Wow!

17:06.210 --> 17:09.060
-I can't believe this.
-Guess what?

17:09.130 --> 17:12.480
-You're dying.
-I am not dying.

17:12.550 --> 17:15.599
I'm just a little stressed,
that's all.

17:15.680 --> 17:16.980
Marley?

17:18.020 --> 17:22.020
You're dying,
but I'm gonna give you three wishes.

17:24.650 --> 17:27.069
Then I want to

17:29.650 --> 17:32.080
-fly.
-Okay. Done.

17:32.160 --> 17:35.410
Wait a minute.
This is for real?

17:35.490 --> 17:39.340
-I want a million bucks.
-Alright, but I just have to warn you

17:39.410 --> 17:42.630
that that is only gonna be
500,000 after taxes.

17:42.920 --> 17:46.720
-Just 'cause I didn't say 'tax free'?
-Even I don't mess with the IRS.

17:46.800 --> 17:48.260
That sucks.

17:52.340 --> 17:53.810
Third wish?

17:55.050 --> 17:58.020
Okay. Let me think.

18:01.020 --> 18:03.440
-Tic-toc, baby.
-Don't rush me. Jesus.

18:03.520 --> 18:05.690
-Hey, hey.
-Oh.

18:05.770 --> 18:07.270
-Wow.
-I'm sorry.

18:07.360 --> 18:09.280
-You said it, didn't you?
-Yeah, I did.

18:09.360 --> 18:10.780
Wow.

18:13.490 --> 18:17.580
I don't know.
I don't know what I want.

18:17.660 --> 18:20.540
You know.
You just don't want to admit it.

18:20.620 --> 18:24.420
But I'm pretty sure
that if you give it some thought,

18:24.500 --> 18:26.550
you'll figure it out.

18:28.670 --> 18:30.220
(God): Marley.

18:31.800 --> 18:33.850
(Julian): Marley.

18:33.930 --> 18:36.350
Marley, wake up.
it's over.

18:38.510 --> 18:40.190
What's over?

18:41.890 --> 18:43.480
Where am I?

18:44.770 --> 18:46.320
Where's Whoopi?

18:47.360 --> 18:49.450
The procedure went fine.

18:49.520 --> 18:52.240
We're going to move you
to the recovery room now.

18:52.320 --> 18:57.790
I took some biopsies.
We should get results in a few days.

18:57.870 --> 18:59.460
-it's delicious.
-I agree.

18:59.530 --> 19:02.790
It's crunchy and chewy. Peter,
I'd like to share mine with you.

19:02.870 --> 19:04.790
Here, Pop. I'll go.
(Marley laughing)

19:04.870 --> 19:08.220
(Sarah makes choking sounds)
Hey, behave.

19:08.290 --> 19:10.760
Geez, what the hell?

19:10.840 --> 19:15.840
Okay. Alright, alright. I forgot
to cook the noodles first.

19:15.930 --> 19:18.720
-Ohhh.
-There's noodles in this?

19:18.800 --> 19:21.520
(Peter): Do not feed this to Stanley.
Take it.

19:21.600 --> 19:23.600
(Renee): No.
I got all this on my plate.

19:23.680 --> 19:26.780
I have cancer.

19:29.400 --> 19:32.150
I went to the doctor last week.
Remember?

19:32.230 --> 19:36.160
I said I was fine
and that I was just stressed, but

19:36.240 --> 19:38.710
-I'm not.
-What are you talking about?

19:38.780 --> 19:40.130
I have, um,

19:41.580 --> 19:45.250
colon cancer.
How does one get that, you might ask.

19:45.330 --> 19:48.710
Because I did.
And, um,

19:50.380 --> 19:53.930
-he said...
-We don't know.

19:54.010 --> 19:55.720
Of course you don't.

19:57.630 --> 19:59.930
Everyone is dying of cancer
these days.

20:00.010 --> 20:03.640
Why would you try to figure it out
and put yourself out of a job?

20:03.720 --> 20:08.980
I know this is rough, but we need
to talk about what to do next.

20:09.060 --> 20:13.490
I'm going to consult with the head
of the oncology department, Dr Sanders.

20:13.570 --> 20:17.620
Can, can, can you just take it out,
so I can go on with my life?

20:17.700 --> 20:19.790
No, unfortunately we can't.

20:19.860 --> 20:22.960
It's already spread
throughout the entire colon,

20:23.030 --> 20:25.710
making surgery impossible
at this point.

20:27.500 --> 20:30.090
And this other guy
would have a better idea?

20:30.170 --> 20:31.590
Dr Sanders, yes.

20:31.670 --> 20:36.770
He's one of the best in the country
for-- late stage cancers.

20:38.930 --> 20:43.060
Marley,
at this point you only have two options.

20:43.140 --> 20:46.980
Either you start treatment immediately,
or you'll die.

20:50.940 --> 20:52.280
Ah.

20:52.360 --> 20:55.530
Okay Dr G., I'm gonna give you
a little free advice.

20:55.610 --> 20:58.160
Don't use the 'D' word.
it's a bit of a downer.

20:58.240 --> 21:00.460
And if you're trying
to sell me treatment,

21:00.530 --> 21:05.040
I would rethink the 'B' option,
because dying isn't an option.

21:05.120 --> 21:08.840
Maybe try something like:
'Try our new and improved chemo,

21:08.910 --> 21:11.630
because the alternative
will leave you breathless!

21:11.710 --> 21:15.340
When your 2:30 walks in here
and you have to tell him that he's dying,

21:15.420 --> 21:17.890
just try it with a little more feeling.

21:21.630 --> 21:25.430
Anyway-- who wants dessert?

21:36.190 --> 21:38.490
Mom? Hi.

21:39.530 --> 21:42.030
Sorry to call so late.

21:48.330 --> 21:51.080
Mom, I'm okay.

22:00.340 --> 22:03.470
I'll make sure that you
get the best possible treatment.

22:03.550 --> 22:07.560
-I don't care how much it costs.
-You're going to buy her a new colon?

22:07.640 --> 22:09.310
I will not have
a money discussion.

22:09.390 --> 22:11.730
The gloves are coming off.

22:11.810 --> 22:14.310
Money is the only thing
you can talk about.

22:14.400 --> 22:18.990
Marley needs our love and support.
At least pretend to be here for her.

22:19.070 --> 22:22.120
I don't have to pretend.
That's your department.

22:26.450 --> 22:28.290
I'm so glad we got together.

22:33.540 --> 22:35.380
So what did you tell Rob?

22:36.420 --> 22:37.790
-That I have mono.
-Right.

22:37.880 --> 22:39.380
And I'm working from home.

22:39.460 --> 22:41.840
I don't want anybody
from work knowing.

22:41.920 --> 22:45.930
I got it.
Your butt is your business.

22:46.970 --> 22:48.600
Huh? Huh?

22:48.680 --> 22:51.430
-My Dad flew out this morning.
-Is your Mom happy?

22:51.520 --> 22:53.690
So much so she's celebrating
by moving here.

He said: "Excuse me, sir, um,

25:16.660 --> 25:20.260
uh-- is that a rectal thermometer
behind your ear?"

25:20.330 --> 25:25.380

over there,

what do you call a jazz musician
without a girlfriend?

29:58.360 --> 30:02.240
-Here we go. What?
-He doesn't have a home.

30:07.290 --> 30:09.660
It's 'homeless'.

30:09.750 --> 30:11.500
But 'A' for effort.

30:18.300 --> 30:22.850
-So that was incredible.
-He's been performing since he was 8.

30:22.930 --> 30:26.650
-Wow!
-So, what are you doing now?

30:26.720 --> 30:29.440

-No.
-Why do you not have a girlfriend?

31:07.350 --> 31:11.690
-Is it that obvious?
-Oh, yeah. Yup.

31:11.770 --> 31:15.860
-I practically live at the hospital.
-Not much of a life.

31:15.940 --> 31:18.690
Actually, Dr Sanders
called me to work here

31:18.770 --> 31:23.280

31:30.660 --> 31:33.130
Then why aren't you
in a relationship?

31:33.200 --> 31:36.550
Because I don't need to be in one
to have a personal life.

31:36.620 --> 31:39.670
-You're not answering the question.
-Well,

31:39.750 --> 31:43.930
read about it in my next book:
'Why relationships suck ass!

31:44.010 --> 31:47.640
You know, I've never met anyone
that talks so much

31:47.720 --> 31:50.350

31:51.390 --> 31:53.890
Okay. Fine.

31:55.100 --> 31:57.320

32:18.080 --> 32:19.380
Good night.

32:27.550 --> 32:30.930
I'm making you
a nice, big, juicy steak.

32:31.010 --> 32:35.020
Ma! I've been a vegetarian
for 12 years.

32:35.100 --> 32:38.100
Well, you need some protein.

32:40.020 --> 32:41.490
Mm-hmm.

32:42.520 --> 32:45.030
By the way, your father called again.

32:46.530 --> 32:50.120
He said he was going to do
his best to make it out here.

32:50.200 --> 32:53.540
Blah, blah, blah.

32:53.620 --> 32:57.090
I don't know why you didn't have
your friend Sarah watch the dog.

32:57.160 --> 32:59.090
Then I could stay here with you.

32:59.170 --> 33:02.040
Strike one.
Wanna try for two?

33:02.130 --> 33:04.930
Well, I can't control my allergies.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.050
Or her complaining.

33:07.130 --> 33:09.100
I heard that.

33:11.840 --> 33:14.970
I just wanna help.
Tell me what to do.

33:15.060 --> 33:17.100
Mom, you're here. That's enough.

33:17.180 --> 33:19.610
Would you go to a nutritionist
if I could arrange it?

33:19.690 --> 33:21.610
-Mom!
-Everybody,

33:21.690 --> 33:25.910
-swears by this macrobiotic diet.
-I don't want that heely-feely shit.

33:25.980 --> 33:27.990
So just back off.

33:31.660 --> 33:34.450
Oh, this steak is burning.

33:36.700 --> 33:38.630
Go rub some dander on her.

33:38.700 --> 33:40.630
Go.

33:43.500 --> 33:47.970
Shoo! Shoo! Call him, Marley.
Call him. That's not funny.

33:49.170 --> 33:52.050
Hi, Dr Sanders. Marley.

33:53.090 --> 33:54.560
Have a seat.

33:56.600 --> 34:00.350
-Is anyone joining you? Mother?
-Trust me,

34:00.430 --> 34:02.480
neither of us wants her here.

34:04.730 --> 34:06.530
-Hi.
-Uh-oh.

34:06.610 --> 34:09.409
Two against one.
This can't be good.

34:11.070 --> 34:16.370
Marley, I'm sorry I have to say this,
but there's been no improvement.

34:17.830 --> 34:19.540
-Wait. What are you saying?

34:19.620 --> 34:22.750
The chemo hasn't worked
as we had hoped.

34:24.330 --> 34:27.260
And the tumours
have continued to grow.

34:27.340 --> 34:29.760
What now?
What...

34:29.840 --> 34:34.219
There is one particular clinical trial
that's had some success.

34:34.300 --> 34:39.020
Although, typically with patients
who had better result from chemo.

34:39.100 --> 34:42.480
Success like people cured?

34:42.560 --> 34:44.980
-Yeah.
-What is it?

34:45.060 --> 34:49.159
It's a series of treatments,
two times a week.

34:49.230 --> 34:51.239
It's injected into the affected areas.

34:51.320 --> 34:56.250
The objective is to stop or slow down
the growth of the cancerous cells.

34:56.320 --> 34:57.420
It's an option.

34:57.490 --> 35:01.750
But you need to be aware that
the side effects are very extreme.

35:01.830 --> 35:04.000
There are no guarantees.

35:08.170 --> 35:09.590
Of course.

35:11.170 --> 35:12.920
We have to do it.

35:16.220 --> 35:18.440
So you're going to be a guinea pig?

35:18.510 --> 35:21.480
It's not an experiment.
It's a clinical trial.

35:21.560 --> 35:24.690
What do you know about this trial?
What are the success rates?

35:24.770 --> 35:27.270
-He said they're pretty good.
-Pretty good?

35:27.350 --> 35:30.900
And that's it? You're going
to do it just off of that?

35:30.980 --> 35:34.860
Actually no, I flipped a coin.
Heads do it. Tails drop dead.

35:34.950 --> 35:37.920
Look, I'm just saying
that we need to make sure this is

35:37.990 --> 35:41.210
-the appropriate course of action.
-Excuse me. We?

35:41.290 --> 35:42.750
As in you, Mom and me?

35:42.830 --> 35:45.830
When have you ever been around
to make any important decision?

35:45.910 --> 35:50.010
You know what? I'm not going to have
this conversation with you. I...

36:06.940 --> 36:09.910
Will she be able to go home today?

36:09.980 --> 36:12.570
Depends on how she responds
to the treatment.

36:15.190 --> 36:16.700
Ow!

36:16.780 --> 36:19.620
Can I be here
while you do the procedure?

36:19.700 --> 36:20.820
No.

36:21.700 --> 36:23.700
I'm sorry, you cannot.

36:28.670 --> 36:31.640
What if I'm very, very quiet?

36:36.130 --> 36:40.850
Sorry, but the concept of my mother
being quiet is incredibly funny.

36:42.010 --> 36:43.690
It is.

36:46.890 --> 36:51.190
-(Marley): Am I gonna lose my hair?
-(Doctor): No, your hair will be fine.

36:53.770 --> 36:56.200
-(Marley): Ow!
-(Doctor): I'm sorry.

37:08.750 --> 37:12.590
"Roses are red, violets are blue,

37:13.710 --> 37:16.340
I've got ass cancer,

37:18.550 --> 37:20.930
now you know too."

37:21.010 --> 37:24.480
Don't you feel guilty for
leaving me all those nasty messages

37:24.560 --> 37:26.480
for missing work?

37:26.560 --> 37:28.060
Yeah, but I'm...

37:29.350 --> 37:33.570
You should have come to me sooner.
Why did you keep it a secret?

37:33.650 --> 37:37.280
Because I didn't want you
to look at me the way you are now.

37:44.740 --> 37:48.000
So, have you filed
with the insurance company?

37:48.080 --> 37:50.710
Well, I'm not footing the bill
out of my salary.

37:50.790 --> 37:52.760
No, I mean life insurance.

37:52.830 --> 37:57.130
Look, people recover from cancer
and, um,

37:57.210 --> 38:01.010
however much money you need
to make that happen, I want you to have.

38:01.090 --> 38:05.970
There's an option in the company policy
that says that anybody who has a

38:07.770 --> 38:10.390
life-threatening illness

38:10.480 --> 38:13.360
-can cash out.
-Meaning how much?

38:14.400 --> 38:15.570
A million dollars.

38:15.650 --> 38:19.280
Let me guess. That would be
500,000 dollars after taxes.

38:23.610 --> 38:26.160
I think my God will be Gucci.

38:27.620 --> 38:30.590
-Yeah, definitely.
-I think so.

38:32.120 --> 38:34.880
-Oh, I love it.
-You can fight me for it.

38:34.960 --> 38:37.800
I've got a big G for gorgeous.

38:37.880 --> 38:40.680
Cammie goes to college,
or Mommy gets this bag.

38:42.170 --> 38:43.600
(Sarah): Love you.

38:44.340 --> 38:45.390
(Peter): Okay.

38:45.470 --> 38:47.640
They're fabulous!

38:52.810 --> 38:54.530
I want you to have these.

38:59.020 --> 39:00.700
Am I making you hot?

39:02.150 --> 39:06.200
What kind of cologne is that?
He was flirting with me.

39:06.280 --> 39:08.660
-(Marley): Oh, boy.
-(Sarah): You're so weird.

39:11.750 --> 39:12.870
Hey-

39:13.910 --> 39:17.340
There's a maternity department upstairs.
Want to check that out?

39:17.420 --> 39:22.670
You know-- I'm really tired.
I'm gonna go home and lie down.

39:22.760 --> 39:26.260
Um, thank you so much for today.

39:26.340 --> 39:29.100
-I'll call you later. I love you.
-I love you too.

39:35.770 --> 39:36.820
(Sarah): I like that.

39:36.900 --> 39:39.820
(Peter): Looks like something
a stripper would wear.

39:39.900 --> 39:44.870
-Is everything okay?
-No. it's not okay.

39:44.950 --> 39:47.490
-She's really sick.
-I know.

39:47.570 --> 39:51.830
I'm trying so hard to play along,
but I'm terrible at it.

39:51.910 --> 39:56.130
And l-- I just don't want
to ruin her day.

39:56.210 --> 39:58.880
That's the last thing I want to do,
so-- bye.

40:03.630 --> 40:05.630
I'll take her home.

40:10.720 --> 40:14.150
-NO!
-It would look so nice on you.

40:14.220 --> 40:18.820
-Yes, it would. If I was you.
-A simple 'no' would have sufficed.

40:18.900 --> 40:21.450
I don't need no clothes.
This is for you guys.

40:21.520 --> 40:24.740
Everything you own
is swimming on you.

40:24.820 --> 40:29.370
-The swimming look is in.
-I just want my daughter to look good.

40:29.450 --> 40:31.790
When you look good, you feel good.

40:31.870 --> 40:35.340
I don't need a new wardrobe
to feel good.

40:35.410 --> 40:38.210
You also don't need
a negative attitude.

40:38.290 --> 40:41.540
You need to wake up and realize
I'm not getting any better.

40:41.630 --> 40:44.010
-Can we not do this here.
-No. Seriously!

40:44.090 --> 40:47.310
You always bitch about
how Dad can't confront anything

40:47.380 --> 40:49.380
and here you are
walking around in a haze,

40:49.470 --> 40:53.190
like protein and a designer dress
are going to cure my cancer.

41:00.150 --> 41:02.270
Ahhhh!

41:03.900 --> 41:06.370
This is the car. This one.
Thank you.

41:06.440 --> 41:10.200
-Was it really that bad?
-I heard you from Jimmy Choo.

41:11.490 --> 41:16.340
-it's just that she drives me crazy.
-Well, duh! She's your Mom.

41:16.410 --> 41:18.040
That's her job.

41:19.080 --> 41:21.800
-Thanks for everything.
-Thank you.

41:21.880 --> 41:25.550
Ah. OW. Ah.

41:26.590 --> 41:27.930
Marley.

41:28.970 --> 41:31.720
Hey. it's okay.

41:33.430 --> 41:35.600
Just give me a second.

41:36.970 --> 41:39.150
It's gonna be okay.

41:45.690 --> 41:48.410
-Is she gonna be alright?
-She's dehydrated.

41:48.490 --> 41:51.110
A couple of bags of saline
and she'll be feeling better.

41:51.200 --> 41:52.700
She is right here, people.

41:52.780 --> 41:55.200
'Shop till you drop'
is only an expression.

41:55.280 --> 41:56.910
Not bad.

41:56.990 --> 41:59.620
That's the best thing
I could come up with.

41:59.710 --> 42:01.300
Dr G.

42:01.370 --> 42:03.670
-Ah, hi.
-Hi. Hello.

42:03.750 --> 42:06.970
GI extra ordinaire.
Artist extra ordinaire.

42:07.050 --> 42:09.140
-Pleased to meet you.
-Nice to-- oh!

42:09.210 --> 42:10.260
I...

42:11.430 --> 42:14.850
I'm suddenly in the mood for some Jell-O.
Do you need anything?

42:14.930 --> 42:16.650
Really? Jell-O?

42:18.600 --> 42:21.150
-I'm good. Thanks.
-Okay.

42:22.940 --> 42:27.610
Strangely, she's not so good
with needles. Ouch!

42:27.690 --> 42:31.490
-So what happened?
-I don't know. I just had a

42:31.570 --> 42:35.120
-sudden, searing pain.
-Hm.

42:35.200 --> 42:37.040
Come on, doc. Level with me.

42:38.120 --> 42:40.090
Is all this really
gonna be worth it?

42:40.160 --> 42:42.920
Yeah, um-- well just

42:43.000 --> 42:45.970
-tell me where exactly...
-OW!

42:46.040 --> 42:47.220
Sorry.

42:49.050 --> 42:53.050
Well, there was a pain in my ass,
but then I realized it was my mother.

42:53.130 --> 42:56.180
Marley, come on.
Just answer the question.

42:56.260 --> 43:00.230
Is there a woman with a very big needle
standing next to me?

43:01.270 --> 43:05.270
Ow! That's my skin
you're pricking.

43:05.350 --> 43:07.610
I'm sorry. I can't seem
to find a vein.

43:07.690 --> 43:09.160
Let me try.

43:22.450 --> 43:24.210
Dr G?

43:25.540 --> 43:27.790
I think I found one.

43:34.590 --> 43:37.060
I don't know how it's doing
against my cancer,

43:37.140 --> 43:40.440
but this treatment
sure is kicking my ass.

43:40.510 --> 43:42.520
Two down, eight to go.

43:42.600 --> 43:45.320
Hey, Marley. Hey. Marley.

43:45.390 --> 43:47.820
-Hi.
-Hi.

43:47.900 --> 43:50.490
Hey, Marley.

43:50.570 --> 43:56.160
There's, um, there's a fund raiser
on Saturday" for patients.

43:56.240 --> 43:59.990
-Oh, nice.
-Yes, it's for patients, and...

44:00.080 --> 44:04.960
Sorry. I'm just going to walk over there
where I can still eavesdrop.

44:06.120 --> 44:08.590
I wanted to see
if you wanted to come with me.

44:08.670 --> 44:12.550
Not come with me as a date,
or anything like that. No.

44:12.630 --> 44:16.600
It's semi-formal, so I don't know
if you like the idea of getting dressed.

44:16.680 --> 44:19.390
I can't tell if you're trying
to talk me into it,

44:19.470 --> 44:23.020
-or talk yourself out of it.
-A bit of both.

44:23.100 --> 44:28.280
-I'll see how I feel Saturday.
-Oh, good. Okay. Thank you.

44:28.350 --> 44:30.820
-Sorry. Thank you. Bye.
-Bye.

44:33.610 --> 44:38.740
Where, besides your life and General
Hospital, do doctors look like that?

44:38.820 --> 44:41.750
I mean-- come on!

44:43.290 --> 44:46.260
Hello, Marley. It's your father.

44:46.330 --> 44:49.750
First of all, I don't appreciate
you hanging...

44:55.510 --> 45:00.730
Stanley meta really cute Shitszu today.
I think he had a crush.

45:02.850 --> 45:05.850
I'm not saying you should,
but if you let him mate,

45:05.930 --> 45:08.110
you'd probably start
a whole new breed:

45:09.140 --> 45:10.820
BullShits.

45:11.940 --> 45:14.030
BullShit Terriers.

45:21.490 --> 45:23.080
Okay.

45:26.370 --> 45:28.500
Someone needs comfort food.

45:29.540 --> 45:34.590
I'm gonna go home and fix you
a really nice Italian dish.

45:35.630 --> 45:38.260
So later on when your doorbell rings,

45:39.470 --> 45:42.270
you answer it. Okay?

45:42.390 --> 45:43.890
Okay.

45:48.480 --> 45:50.100
Beautiful.

46:39.150 --> 46:40.530
You Marley?

46:40.610 --> 46:42.580
-Yeah.
-I'm Vinnie.

46:44.110 --> 46:45.870
These are for you.

46:47.160 --> 46:49.410
Thank you. l-- whoa, whoa.

46:53.370 --> 46:55.920
-I love you.
-Bastard.

47:12.350 --> 47:13.600
Ah.

47:15.190 --> 47:18.280
How do you know Peter?

47:19.650 --> 47:20.870
Who?

47:22.490 --> 47:26.490
I got a call from work
to be here tonight.

47:28.160 --> 47:30.160
Especial Escorts.

47:39.000 --> 47:40.500
I'm really sorry.

47:40.590 --> 47:45.430
Well, you should know
that I definitely live up to my nickname:

47:45.510 --> 47:47.600
Little Bit of Heaven.

47:47.680 --> 47:50.980
Oh!

47:52.640 --> 47:55.140
That is some offer, but, um,

47:56.270 --> 47:57.990
no.

48:07.110 --> 48:10.830
-Oh, don't forget your flowers.
-Nah, you keep them.

48:10.910 --> 48:14.210
Beautiful flowers
for a beautiful lady.

48:14.290 --> 48:15.460
Thank you.

48:15.540 --> 48:20.670
Actually, I don't mean to sound rude,
but-- you don't look so good.

48:22.210 --> 48:25.810
I'm sick.
Probably dying.

48:25.880 --> 48:28.310
There isn't anything to be afraid of.

48:28.390 --> 48:32.060
I've died twice
and they brought me back both times.

48:32.140 --> 48:35.190
Really?
Did you see anything,

48:35.270 --> 48:38.900
like bright lights or anything?
Whoopi?

48:38.980 --> 48:40.860
No.

48:40.940 --> 48:44.160
It Was, uh,
more like floating in water.

48:45.490 --> 48:46.780
It was real nice.

48:47.860 --> 48:50.290
I could have floated there forever.

48:51.780 --> 48:53.630
Nice to meet you, Marley.

48:54.740 --> 48:56.500
Nice to meet you.

49:02.040 --> 49:03.140
Vinnie!

49:05.300 --> 49:07.920
Alright, I'm going all in.
You know why?

49:08.010 --> 49:10.850
Because I got the nuts.

49:10.930 --> 49:14.100
So you should probably fold,
or...

49:14.180 --> 49:16.020
What are you doing?

49:16.100 --> 49:18.020
Or I'm bluffing.

49:24.320 --> 49:26.030
Fold.

49:26.110 --> 49:29.200
-Ohhh!
-Ohhh! Woo!

49:29.280 --> 49:31.120
-Okay. See?
-Oh, boy.

49:31.200 --> 49:34.000
-Smart.
-Full house, baby.

49:35.030 --> 49:39.880
-Are you really single?
-I'm the cancer chick, remember?

49:39.960 --> 49:43.630
Hardly qualifies me for being
somebody's dream girl.

49:43.710 --> 49:48.220
Why? Most of the great romances
in history end in death.

49:48.300 --> 49:52.180
Romeo and Juliet.
JFK and Jackie.

49:52.260 --> 49:54.640
-Siegfried and Roy.
-Um,

49:55.680 --> 49:57.560
Roy is not dead.

49:59.270 --> 50:01.320
Well, he didn't look too good.

50:02.520 --> 50:05.360
-I haven't found the right guy yet.
-Bullshit.

50:05.440 --> 50:07.740
Who wouldn't want a girl like you?

50:07.820 --> 50:10.240
You are just afraid to let them in,

50:10.320 --> 50:14.000
because if you do and they reject you,
it hurts worse than death.

50:14.070 --> 50:16.580
You're like

50:16.660 --> 50:20.210
-Sigmund Freud all of a sudden?
-(German) Ja.

50:21.870 --> 50:25.750
Actually, a guy I like asked me out
this weekend. Sort of.

50:25.840 --> 50:27.550
He said it wasn't a date.

50:27.630 --> 50:29.430
-What time does it start?
-Five.

50:29.510 --> 50:31.010
-Dinner and a movie?
-Fund raiser.

50:31.090 --> 50:32.510
-Formal?
-Semi.

50:32.590 --> 50:34.560
-He's an idiot.
-I know. Right?

50:35.800 --> 50:39.430
Well, maybe he'll wise up
and treat it like a real date.

50:39.520 --> 50:40.980
If not, fuck him.

50:45.980 --> 50:48.400
Would you mind doing me a favour?

50:51.070 --> 50:53.320
(Marley): Oh, I like that.

50:53.400 --> 50:55.620
(Vinnie): Yeah, a little bit of heaven?

50:55.700 --> 50:57.250
-You want more heaven?
-Oh.

50:57.330 --> 51:01.050
You want a whole lot of heaven?
Oh!

51:01.120 --> 51:04.880
-(Marley): Ooh! Oh, my God, baby.
-Oh, my!

51:04.960 --> 51:08.380
Oh, my. Oh, my God.
Ohhh!

51:08.460 --> 51:10.930
Ohhh! Ohhh!

51:12.920 --> 51:16.650
(Vinnie): Ohhh!
Oh, that feels good.

51:16.720 --> 51:18.600
(Marley): Oh, oh.

51:18.680 --> 51:20.980
(Vinnie): OW, the bottle. Ow, ow.

51:21.060 --> 51:23.690
-Oh.
-Woo!

51:23.770 --> 51:27.740
-Wow! Oh, my.
-Woo.

51:27.810 --> 51:29.940
WOW, Vinnie.

51:30.020 --> 51:31.780
-Oh.
-Marley.

51:33.240 --> 51:35.490
-Thank you, Vinnie.
-You're welcome.

51:35.570 --> 51:37.540
I had so much fun.

51:41.200 --> 51:44.960
See what happens
when you give a guy half a chance.

51:51.460 --> 51:54.760
You might be sore in the morning.

51:54.840 --> 51:57.560
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

51:59.890 --> 52:01.140
See ya.

52:30.630 --> 52:35.100
-Is there a doctor in the house?
-Que guapa que estás.

52:35.170 --> 52:39.770
No clue what you just said,
but it sounds so good I don't care.

52:39.840 --> 52:42.060
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

52:42.140 --> 52:45.020
-No, for coming.
-I know.

52:45.100 --> 52:48.520
-Would you like to have a drink?
-Yeah.

52:49.650 --> 52:51.650
Okay. There.

52:54.230 --> 52:58.410
-I have a good one.
-Could you be more specific?

52:58.490 --> 53:02.660
-A joke.
-Oh, God, I created a monster.

53:02.740 --> 53:05.170
-You wanna listen to it?
-Yes, of course.

53:05.240 --> 53:10.750
Okay, um, okay.
Why does it suck being an egg?

53:12.210 --> 53:15.180
-I give up.
-Why does it suck being an egg?

53:15.250 --> 53:19.130
Because you only get laid once,
you only get eaten once,

53:19.220 --> 53:22.850
you take 10 minutes to get hard
and only 3 to get soft.

53:22.930 --> 53:26.680
And then you have to share this box
with 11 other guys.

53:26.770 --> 53:29.190
But the-- worst thing is...

53:30.310 --> 53:32.480
Oh, it's the funny part.

53:32.560 --> 53:35.030
(Marley laughing)

53:35.110 --> 53:37.780
You are the worst joke teller
I've ever met.

53:37.860 --> 53:40.080
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, that

53:40.150 --> 53:43.410
the only person to ever
sit in your face is your mother.

53:43.490 --> 53:45.210
You're just hopeless.

53:48.960 --> 53:51.830
-Ms Corbett.
-Hi, Dr Sanders.

53:55.710 --> 53:57.560
I'll grab an appetizer.

54:02.590 --> 54:04.970
-She's a brave girl.
-Yeah.

54:06.010 --> 54:08.310
You know she quit the trial.

54:09.810 --> 54:14.240
NO, l-- I didn't know that.

54:17.360 --> 54:20.780
It seems to me that your patient's
having an easier time

54:20.860 --> 54:24.120
keeping emotion out of this decision
then you are.

54:24.200 --> 54:29.170
I'm just trying to save her life.
What else am I supposed to do?

54:29.250 --> 54:31.420
Why did you invite her here?

54:31.500 --> 54:36.050
Because there's patients, survivors.
it's a fund raiser for cancer.

54:36.130 --> 54:39.880
The line is there for a reason, Doctor.
Not just for the patients.

54:39.960 --> 54:42.640
You'll need to think about
what you're doing.

54:48.260 --> 54:49.560
-Hey, can I?
-Yes, sir.

54:49.640 --> 54:50.730
Thank you.

54:54.480 --> 54:56.230
What did I miss?

54:58.520 --> 55:02.620
-Do you wanna get out of here?
-Yeah, I know just the place.

55:03.820 --> 55:06.750
First dinner, then a surprise.

55:10.700 --> 55:12.080
Let's go.

55:12.710 --> 55:16.300
What-- a surprise in a dark alley?

55:16.380 --> 55:20.760
-Do you really know where we're going?
-Yeah, I do.

55:20.840 --> 55:23.390
Where are you taking me?
Come on.

55:23.470 --> 55:25.970
In all the years you've been here,

55:26.050 --> 55:29.650
you've never been
to a little place called Paradise.

55:32.180 --> 55:34.230
Hey, hey.

55:37.060 --> 55:40.780
Hey, Marley. Hey.

55:40.860 --> 55:44.950
-Hey. Wow.
-Don't worry, they don't bite

55:47.530 --> 55:48.780
much.

56:03.800 --> 56:05.220
Isn't this fun?

56:05.300 --> 56:07.970
-Hey, hey, hey.
-Are you new in town?

56:14.680 --> 56:15.730
Hey-

56:21.570 --> 56:22.940
Marley.

56:26.070 --> 56:27.320
Hey-

56:38.830 --> 56:40.960
Hey, no, wait.

56:41.040 --> 56:42.800
No, wait, wait, wait.

56:48.220 --> 56:50.560
You look amazing.

57:05.360 --> 57:07.160
(Marley and Julian laughing)

57:07.240 --> 57:09.910
You're such a tranny magnet.

57:09.990 --> 57:14.040
If I wasn't there, you could have
for sure gotten some action.

57:14.120 --> 57:18.340
I know.
Actually, you know that Adam?

57:18.410 --> 57:21.590
She was kind of hot, no?
Yeah.

57:22.630 --> 57:24.430
Ahhh.

57:27.920 --> 57:29.600
Where did you go?

57:33.600 --> 57:35.440
Do you believe in God?

57:37.520 --> 57:39.810
-Wow.
-No, really.

57:39.890 --> 57:44.320
Okay, if you ask me, Dr Julian Goldstein,
if I believe in God...

57:44.400 --> 57:48.780
I mean, I believe in science
and in empirical evidence, so,

57:48.860 --> 57:52.540
no, I don't believe in a higher power.

57:52.620 --> 57:58.420
But if you ask me, Julian,
I'd say I don't know.

58:00.500 --> 58:01.840
Why?

58:03.790 --> 58:06.050
I envy people who do.

58:07.250 --> 58:10.300
They're so sure
that something exists.

58:11.380 --> 58:13.180
What a great way to live.

58:14.300 --> 58:15.980
Without fear.

58:19.060 --> 58:20.780
What are you afraid of?

58:24.520 --> 58:26.950
-No.
-Come on. Come on.

58:28.570 --> 58:29.940
I want to know.

58:31.280 --> 58:34.450
-The whole list?
-How about the top three?

58:34.530 --> 58:36.030
Fine.

58:36.120 --> 58:39.120
I'm afraid if I die
my Mom will never recover.

58:41.210 --> 58:42.380
Okay.

58:43.710 --> 58:46.340
I worry about who'd take care
of my dog.

58:50.510 --> 58:52.130
Anything else?

58:52.220 --> 58:56.140
I'm scared this entire night
is gonna go by without you kissing me.

59:06.900 --> 59:08.150
Ah.

01:00:00.580 --> 01:00:02.580
So this is a date, right?

01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:09.000
Yeah-- It's just that I--
they don't wanna...

01:00:14.260 --> 01:00:16.010
I quit the trial.

01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:18.300
I know.

01:00:19.350 --> 01:00:23.070
-Why?
-I want to enjoy quality of life.

01:00:24.100 --> 01:00:28.320
Besides, and you're gonna think
I'm crazy, but Whoopi Goldberg...

01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:31.770
She is a lady who knows
what she's talking about.

01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:36.450
(Marley laughing)

01:00:36.530 --> 01:00:39.410
-You don't.
-Right.

01:00:39.490 --> 01:00:42.330
Coming from a guy
with a yo-yo collection.

01:00:42.410 --> 01:00:45.210
What?
You don't like yo-yos?

01:00:45.290 --> 01:00:47.630
You have a problem
against yo-yos?

01:00:48.670 --> 01:00:50.090
Well, let me show you.

01:00:52.750 --> 01:00:53.930
Okay.

01:00:56.590 --> 01:00:59.720
You really are the biggest dork
I've ever slept with.

01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:02.020
That's a very nice thing of you to say,

01:01:02.100 --> 01:01:06.320
but it's afar better compliment
if you leave dork out of that sentence.

01:01:06.390 --> 01:01:11.270
You are the biggest
I have ever slept with.

01:01:14.690 --> 01:01:18.620
What a trick!
What a trick!

01:01:23.370 --> 01:01:25.710
Yeah, yeah, I know, but I...

01:01:28.330 --> 01:01:32.380
♪ I know you're fed up

01:01:32.460 --> 01:01:36.590

-Okay.

01:02:55.500 --> 01:02:58.470
Do you see those two guys
talking to Julian?

01:02:58.550 --> 01:03:00.590
Okay, look now.

01:03:02.340 --> 01:03:04.590
Stop. Stop looking.

01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:08.270
I'm having drinks
with Clark Kent tonight.

01:03:08.350 --> 01:03:11.270
And dinner with Superman tomorrow.

01:03:11.350 --> 01:03:15.860
Oh boy, you have taken my whore crown
and are wearing it so well.

01:03:15.940 --> 01:03:19.190
It's a little big.
I've been wearing it as a belt.

01:03:21.150 --> 01:03:22.200
Ahh!

01:03:23.860 --> 01:03:28.620
You know, actually, Renee's life
is looking pretty good to me lately.

01:03:33.910 --> 01:03:35.760
Marley, I...

01:03:38.250 --> 01:03:41.930
I'm sorry, Marley, I don't know.
I just-- I'm sorry.

01:03:42.010 --> 01:03:43.630
Sssh. It's okay.

01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:35.770
Oh, that's sweet, isn't it?

01:04:35.850 --> 01:04:38.570
Let's put it right in here
with your name on it.

01:04:38.690 --> 01:04:43.110
What do you think Martha Stewart
would think of my arrangement, Stanley?

01:04:43.190 --> 01:04:44.540
Okay.

01:04:44.610 --> 01:04:49.740
Maybe I could quit planning parties
and do my own flower arrangements.

01:04:52.740 --> 01:04:54.540
You're home early.

01:04:54.620 --> 01:04:57.790
-Is everything okay?
-Yeah, it's fine.

01:04:59.290 --> 01:05:02.390
-Did something happen?
-I'm going back to bed.

01:05:02.460 --> 01:05:04.840
Did you and Julian have a fight?

01:05:06.970 --> 01:05:08.310
No.

01:05:08.380 --> 01:05:11.890
Do you want to talk about it?
Maybe I could help.

01:05:11.970 --> 01:05:15.220
Right. 'Cause you're the expert
in relationships.

01:05:24.900 --> 01:05:28.150
Mom, please, not now.

01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:31.330
I may have made a mistake
marrying your father.

01:05:31.410 --> 01:05:35.250
May have?
The man is emotionally constipated.

01:05:35.330 --> 01:05:38.170
I'm grateful he gave me you.

01:06:00.060 --> 01:06:02.150
Oh, my goodness.

01:06:03.190 --> 01:06:05.440
Can I have a big hug?
Oh.

01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:08.030
Mmm.

01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:13.620
-Hey.
-Did she tell you?

01:06:13.700 --> 01:06:15.950
God, my mother is a walking mouth.

01:06:16.030 --> 01:06:19.760
-A walking mouth.
-Hello, Cammie.

01:06:19.830 --> 01:06:22.750
-You look very pretty today.
-What do you tell him?

01:06:22.830 --> 01:06:27.510
-And I'm smart.
-Good girl. Good girl.

01:06:27.590 --> 01:06:29.090
Oooh!

01:06:30.380 --> 01:06:34.680
Oh grody, he's peeing!

01:06:37.470 --> 01:06:39.690
So what was this morning about?

01:06:40.730 --> 01:06:44.230
-I don't know. I couldn't sleep.
-I know.

01:06:44.310 --> 01:06:48.530
-But why?
-Well, a reminder: I'm dying.

01:06:50.110 --> 01:06:54.540
Yeah okay, and I haven't helped you,
um,

01:06:54.620 --> 01:06:57.330
get in touch with all the--
the anger and...

01:06:57.410 --> 01:06:58.910
You know what? Just stop.

01:06:58.990 --> 01:07:02.540
I'm so not in the mood
for a lecture right now.

01:07:02.620 --> 01:07:06.170
Hey! It's obvious that you're scared.
it's normal. it's fine.

01:07:06.250 --> 01:07:09.930
Is it normal for doctors
to screw their patients?

01:07:10.010 --> 01:07:13.760
We had a good time.
Let's just leave it at that.

01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:15.690
Wow!

01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:19.060
-Whoa, already past tense.
-Well,

01:07:20.100 --> 01:07:24.190
reality check: It's going to be
past tense soon enough.

01:07:25.900 --> 01:07:29.150
-Hey, Marley...
-Mmm.

01:07:30.900 --> 01:07:32.950
I love you.

01:07:39.950 --> 01:07:41.950
Oh, great.

01:07:43.830 --> 01:07:45.460
Fantastic.

01:07:47.080 --> 01:07:48.800
You love me.

01:07:50.250 --> 01:07:54.050
What kind of guy
falls in love with a dying girl?

01:07:54.130 --> 01:07:57.310
Don't diminish what's going on
between us. Okay?

01:07:57.390 --> 01:07:59.480
-I know what I'm feeling.
-I do too.

01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:02.560
I feel smothered
and I need you to back off!

01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:03.690
No, no...

01:08:03.770 --> 01:08:06.990
-Ow!
-Are you okay?

01:08:07.060 --> 01:08:09.820
Leave me alone!

01:08:11.400 --> 01:08:15.330
-Come on, let me help you.
-I said: Leave me the hell alone!

01:08:18.319 --> 01:08:21.250
-I'm sorry, sweetie.
-I wanna go home.

01:08:21.330 --> 01:08:23.920
I know.
I'm gonna take you home right now.

01:08:25.250 --> 01:08:26.840
I'm sorry.

01:08:31.250 --> 01:08:33.880
Let me see.
Let me see that beautiful face.

01:08:35.670 --> 01:08:38.600
-Let me see...
-(Renee): Hey, you're back early.

01:08:40.470 --> 01:08:43.939
-Hi, Mommy.
-Hi, pumpkin. Did you all have fun?

01:08:44.020 --> 01:08:45.890
-You're having a party.
-No.

01:08:45.979 --> 01:08:50.729
Some of the other moms dropped by.
Sort of an impromptu thing.

01:08:50.810 --> 01:08:52.779
It's not contagious, you know.

01:08:53.819 --> 01:08:55.240
Of course not.

01:08:56.279 --> 01:09:00.750
Um-- why don't you go back
and play for a little bit.

01:09:00.819 --> 01:09:04.580
-Bye, sweetie, I love you.
-Bye.

01:09:04.660 --> 01:09:08.290
I've just been really busy, you know.
With the baby coming and...

01:09:08.370 --> 01:09:12.380
Oh, really? You obviously have time
for those women in there.

01:09:12.460 --> 01:09:18.689
-That's different. They're...
-What? They're fat, boring and

01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:23.310
-not dying?
-Okay.

01:09:23.390 --> 01:09:25.609
Want me to make this
more palatable for you?

01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:27.560
-That's not what I want
-Are you just

01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:31.020
angry because you're going
to have to find a new babysitter?

01:09:33.439 --> 01:09:34.779
Yeah.

01:09:36.109 --> 01:09:39.779
Come on.
That's exactly what I'm angry about.

01:09:51.290 --> 01:09:53.840
(Peter): They could fire you
on the first day.

01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:55.670
(Matt): Oh, yeah?

01:09:55.750 --> 01:10:02.060
-Hey, the zoo, how was it?
-Oh, you know. It was fantastic.

01:10:02.140 --> 01:10:07.610
Um, Marley, this is Matt. My friend
who moved here from Brooklyn.

01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:10.730
Nice to meet you.
Peter's told me a lot about you.

01:10:10.810 --> 01:10:12.230
Really?

01:10:12.310 --> 01:10:15.570
-Did he tell you I was dying?
-Yeah.

01:10:15.650 --> 01:10:18.780
A couple more weeks
and I'm out of here.

01:10:18.860 --> 01:10:21.240
Why don't you take a look
at my apartment.

01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:24.750
Then maybe you guys
can be neighbours and love buddies.

01:10:24.830 --> 01:10:27.870
Excuse me.
Babe.

01:10:28.910 --> 01:10:31.790
-What are you doing?
-Nothing.

01:10:31.870 --> 01:10:33.550
Have a good day.

01:10:39.970 --> 01:10:42.640
♪ Well, there's a pretty little girl
such a pretty little girl

01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:44.690
♪ I think she lives
around the corner from me

01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:49.230
♪ sometimes is see her walking
past my window as I stare out vacantly ♪

01:10:49.310 --> 01:10:53.900
Shut up! I hear you!

01:10:53.980 --> 01:10:57.780
♪ Pretty little girl are you in love?
I always see you out on your own ♪

01:10:57.860 --> 01:11:00.740
Really? Asshole.

01:11:12.500 --> 01:11:15.050
God!

01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:48.950
I'm scared.

01:11:50.450 --> 01:11:52.420
I'm scared to death.

01:11:54.330 --> 01:11:55.630
Of what?

01:11:56.960 --> 01:12:01.050
-Of dying.
-Everybody dies.

01:12:01.130 --> 01:12:03.180
What are you really afraid of?

01:12:03.260 --> 01:12:07.430
I didn't have enough time
to do all the things I wanted to do.

01:12:07.510 --> 01:12:10.690
-Like what?
-Buy a house!

01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:13.980
Have a baby.
Find somebody who loves me.

01:12:14.060 --> 01:12:17.610
You have that.
Or, you had it.

01:12:17.690 --> 01:12:19.310
How do you know?

01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:23.150
He could just have said all that stuff
because he felt sorry for me.

01:12:23.240 --> 01:12:27.120
He doesn't strike me as someone
who loved you out of pity.

01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:29.120
You should try again.

01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:33.670
-I don't know what his issues are.
-I don't care what his issues are.

01:12:33.750 --> 01:12:37.470
-Do you love him?
-Um...

01:12:37.540 --> 01:12:41.140
Do you love him?

01:12:41.210 --> 01:12:43.560
-Do you?
-I do, I do, I do.

01:12:43.630 --> 01:12:47.260
-Say it in a complete sentence.
-I love him. I love him.

01:12:47.340 --> 01:12:50.560
I-- love him.

01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:52.770
I really do.
I really love him.

01:12:52.850 --> 01:12:55.940
Maybe you should go back down
and tell him.

01:12:56.020 --> 01:12:59.690
-I can't go back down. I'm dead.
-You're not dead.

01:12:59.770 --> 01:13:01.610
The car didn't actually hit you.

01:13:01.690 --> 01:13:05.410
Aside from a little headache,
you should be fine.

01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:15.540
Ah! Oop.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:18.210
Ohh!

01:13:20.170 --> 01:13:21.380
Ohh.

01:13:32.470 --> 01:13:34.190
Oh look, he's right here.

01:13:37.430 --> 01:13:42.240
-Mom? Hey.
-Right. Okay. I'll wait for you outside.

01:13:42.310 --> 01:13:43.660
Thank you.

01:13:48.570 --> 01:13:51.040
-(Marley): Hi.
-(Julian): Hi.

01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:55.710
-What happened to you?
-A street hit me in the face.

01:13:57.290 --> 01:13:59.630
-What?
-Can I talk to you?

01:13:59.710 --> 01:14:02.680
-Yeah.
-Okay. Come on.

01:14:07.090 --> 01:14:09.890
My whole life I've been so afraid
of guys lying to me,

01:14:09.970 --> 01:14:13.140
not being there for me
and ending up Shafted like my mother.

01:14:13.220 --> 01:14:16.690
Somewhere along the line
I decided to take charge of my life,

01:14:16.770 --> 01:14:20.610
and to never let anybody
ever get close enough to hurt me.

01:14:20.690 --> 01:14:22.900
-Ever.
-Okay. Okay.

01:14:25.190 --> 01:14:26.860
And then you come along.

01:14:26.940 --> 01:14:30.070
With your nose in your books
and your yo-yos and your

01:14:30.150 --> 01:14:35.380
spouting off ridiculous jokes like:
"My Mom sat on my-- face.“

01:14:37.370 --> 01:14:40.290
-So you can see how I missed it.
-What?

01:14:40.370 --> 01:14:41.920
What? You missed what?

01:14:58.260 --> 01:15:00.140
You're my third wish.

01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:03.990
I love you.

01:15:17.030 --> 01:15:21.630
Put your turn signal on. Don't make me
guess which way you're gonna go.

01:15:21.710 --> 01:15:24.210
(Beverley): Just surprise me.

01:15:24.290 --> 01:15:28.260
Remember when I was little how I
used to masturbate all the time?

01:15:29.300 --> 01:15:31.970
Do you remember when we went
to that rug store

01:15:32.050 --> 01:15:34.640
and I hopped up
on one of those rolled-up rugs?

01:15:35.930 --> 01:15:38.650
Then you gave me
a two-week time out

01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:42.520
and told me never to touch
my jingle bells again.

01:15:44.850 --> 01:15:47.610
Yeah, I remember that.

01:15:52.110 --> 01:15:53.530
You know?

01:15:56.450 --> 01:16:00.200
My whole life I think that was
the only time you were a bad Mom.

01:16:03.410 --> 01:16:05.840
Yet I was such a shit.

01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:07.710
You're a daughter.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:10.800
That's your job.

01:16:16.890 --> 01:16:19.310
Will you help me plan my funeral?

01:16:22.100 --> 01:16:23.270
Sure.

01:16:24.310 --> 01:16:28.190
I don't want it to be some sombre affair.
I want it to be a celebration.

01:16:28.270 --> 01:16:29.570
I want to put the

01:16:30.610 --> 01:16:33.200
f-u-n back in funeral.

01:16:54.960 --> 01:16:56.340
Hi.

01:16:56.420 --> 01:17:00.220
Listen, you've been a real bitch lately.
Really mean and ugly.

01:17:00.300 --> 01:17:02.980
I just want you to know
that I don't appreciate it.

01:17:03.060 --> 01:17:04.480
-You don't?
-No.

01:17:04.560 --> 01:17:07.810
Because I've done nothing
but support you

01:17:07.890 --> 01:17:11.820
-through this so-called difficult time.
-Well, it has been hard.

01:17:11.900 --> 01:17:16.780
Please- listening to you
going on and on about

01:17:16.860 --> 01:17:19.870
feeling sick and "I'm too tired"

01:17:19.950 --> 01:17:24.580
and "Oh, that Vinnie
really rocked my world."

01:17:24.660 --> 01:17:26.830
-He was awesome wasn't he?
-He was.

01:17:26.910 --> 01:17:28.710
-So back to you.
-What?

01:17:28.790 --> 01:17:31.630
Your behaviour has really
made me angry. It has.

01:17:31.710 --> 01:17:34.880
But you wanna know what makes me
blow my top, see red

01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:40.440
and makes my blood boil
is the fact that I'm gonna miss you.

01:17:42.930 --> 01:17:44.480
So much.

01:17:56.280 --> 01:18:00.280
Do you think I could have
that dance now?

01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:03.240
No.

01:18:04.870 --> 01:18:07.710
That ship sailed so long ago.

01:18:13.130 --> 01:18:16.470
You know?
I thought you'd never ask.

01:18:44.490 --> 01:18:46.580
You're just scared.

01:18:46.660 --> 01:18:50.290
-Break it down.
-Take all that. Aw. Take that.

01:18:50.370 --> 01:18:54.130
Woof. Woof.
I mean it's so high.

01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:05.020
Hi, Marley, it's Dad.

01:19:05.090 --> 01:19:08.970
I'm coming into town tonight
and I'd like to see you.

01:19:09.060 --> 01:19:12.280
I'll call you once I get to the hotel.

01:19:12.350 --> 01:19:15.200
Hope you're doing well.
Bye.

01:19:16.980 --> 01:19:19.700
He sounds like he's making an effort.

01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:25.620
It’s too little too late.

01:19:28.950 --> 01:19:30.370
Mmm.

01:19:34.210 --> 01:19:35.550
Go ahead.

01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:40.300
You know, I don't know the guy,

01:19:40.380 --> 01:19:43.630
and he might be as big a schmuck
as you say he is,

01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:46.890
but, um, it might worth
listening to him.

01:19:48.970 --> 01:19:52.600
Some people have a hard time
opening up about their feelings.

01:19:55.600 --> 01:19:57.150
Low blow.

01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:10.660
(TV announcer): Goal!

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.370
The Penne Arrabiata sounds good.

01:20:15.460 --> 01:20:19.050
Oh thanks, but I'm trying to lose
a couple of pounds.

01:20:25.470 --> 01:20:29.270
-What are we doing?
-What do you mean?

01:20:29.350 --> 01:20:33.570
Making chit-chat like nothing's wrong
between us. I hate it.

01:20:33.640 --> 01:20:37.020
-I'm trying to have a nice visit.
-By not saying anything?

01:20:37.100 --> 01:20:40.820
-What do you want me to do?
-Nothing. it's fine.

01:20:40.940 --> 01:20:45.320
-No. I'm here aren't I?
-Yes, Dad, physically you are here.

01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:48.660
-Marley, come on. I'm trying.
-Give the man a trophy.

01:20:48.740 --> 01:20:49.990
He's trying.

01:20:50.070 --> 01:20:54.830
Could we have just one pleasant meal?
Just one and then talk about this later?

01:20:56.830 --> 01:20:58.670
-Fine.
-Thank you.

01:21:02.710 --> 01:21:05.930
No. it's not fine.
I don't know if I have a "later".

01:21:06.010 --> 01:21:09.430
So we need to talk about this right now,
or I walk out the door

01:21:09.510 --> 01:21:11.640
and may never see you again.

01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:45.380
Marley, wait!

01:21:47.970 --> 01:21:50.890
I don't know what to do, kiddo.
Tell me what to do.

01:21:50.970 --> 01:21:53.190
Dad, I don't want to have to tell you.

01:21:53.260 --> 01:21:56.390
And I shouldn't have to tell you.

01:21:57.430 --> 01:22:00.560
Do you remember that time
probably 20 years ago?

01:22:00.650 --> 01:22:03.620
You said: "I'm glad
God brought me into this world,

01:22:03.690 --> 01:22:06.410
but I wish it was
from a different father."

01:22:06.480 --> 01:22:08.780
Do you remember that?

01:22:08.860 --> 01:22:12.580
And yet I said nothing,
because I didn't know what to say.

01:22:13.740 --> 01:22:15.710
But it killed me inside.

01:22:16.830 --> 01:22:20.830
And now my little girl is very sick
and I can't fix it.

01:22:22.460 --> 01:22:24.180
So please tell me what to say,

01:22:24.250 --> 01:22:27.350
because I can't have you
hating me like this anymore.

01:22:28.510 --> 01:22:31.730
I love you so very much, Marley.

01:22:33.390 --> 01:22:35.510
Just tell me what to do.

01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:39.690
You just did it.

01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:49.820
Thank you.

01:22:58.040 --> 01:22:59.660
(Marley): Renee?

01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:04.970
Renee!

01:23:16.300 --> 01:23:19.770
I know you're in here, so I'm just
gonna say what I came here to say,

01:23:19.850 --> 01:23:21.900
which is: I'm sorry.

01:23:21.980 --> 01:23:27.110
It really hurt when you started
distancing yourself, but it's okay.

01:23:27.190 --> 01:23:28.910
I get it.

01:23:28.980 --> 01:23:33.910
A new baby coming
and me-- leaving.

01:23:33.990 --> 01:23:40.790
It's not fair having to be so happy
and so sad at the same time, is it?

01:23:43.870 --> 01:23:47.250
Our friendship is one of the best things
in my life.

01:23:47.340 --> 01:23:50.930
I'm sorry I'm not gonna get
to know that little boy.

01:23:51.010 --> 01:23:54.760
But I know he'll be beautiful.
Just like Cammie.

01:23:56.680 --> 01:24:00.520
Oh, my God, that little girl is amazing.

01:24:04.440 --> 01:24:06.230
So, please, when she gets older

01:24:06.310 --> 01:24:09.610
tell her that I loved her
like she was my own.

01:24:20.740 --> 01:24:22.290
Bye.

01:24:47.060 --> 01:24:49.560
You sure you still want to do this?

01:26:31.460 --> 01:26:34.130
Hey, what are you gonna do
after I'm gone?

01:26:35.170 --> 01:26:36.510
Hum?

01:26:38.380 --> 01:26:42.060
Come on. You got on my case
about not opening up.

01:26:45.510 --> 01:26:48.940
I just don't like thinking about it.

01:26:49.020 --> 01:26:52.940
Julian, I need to know
that you're gonna be okay.

01:26:53.020 --> 01:26:54.070
Oh, my God.

01:26:54.150 --> 01:26:56.440
We should talk about
what we're feeling.

01:26:56.520 --> 01:27:01.370
-Now I've created a monster.
-Yeah, you have.

01:27:04.030 --> 01:27:05.500
So?

01:27:10.910 --> 01:27:11.960
Um,

01:27:13.250 --> 01:27:18.430
so-- this old man
he goes to the doctor,

01:27:18.500 --> 01:27:20.680
and he brings his wife along.

01:27:20.760 --> 01:27:23.680
It's the yearly physical,
so the doctor says:

01:27:23.760 --> 01:27:28.310
"l just need a urine sample,
a blood, a sperm and a stool sample."

01:27:28.390 --> 01:27:32.690
The old man can't hear very well,
so he looks over to his wife

01:27:32.770 --> 01:27:36.400
and asks: "What?
What is he saying?"

01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:40.240
And the wife yells back at him:
"He wants your underwear!"

01:27:45.820 --> 01:27:48.200
My work here is done.

01:28:21.320 --> 01:28:23.950
Ohh.

01:28:33.540 --> 01:28:34.960
Oh.

01:29:23.090 --> 01:29:26.470
So, I have to go back
to New York for a few days, but

01:29:26.550 --> 01:29:28.470
call me if you need anything. Okay?

01:29:28.550 --> 01:29:30.600
Okay, I will.

01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:34.600
-I love you.
-I love you too.

01:29:35.640 --> 01:29:37.140
Bye.

01:29:43.650 --> 01:29:47.070
And this includes
a big opening party?

01:29:48.450 --> 01:29:52.450
Alright, that's what I want.
Great.

01:29:53.740 --> 01:29:55.840
The name is Sarah Walker.

01:29:57.120 --> 01:29:58.590
It's a surprise.

01:29:59.620 --> 01:30:03.170
(Marley): Okay, thank you very much.
Bye, bye.

01:30:09.050 --> 01:30:13.600
Mom, would you do me a favour
and give this to Sarah for me?

01:30:14.930 --> 01:30:18.310
She's gonna be here in a minute.
You can...

01:30:20.060 --> 01:30:21.230
Oh.

01:30:24.610 --> 01:30:26.830
I'll make sure she gets it.

01:30:31.410 --> 01:30:34.380
And this is for you.

01:30:43.210 --> 01:30:45.130
-it's for me?
-Hm.

01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:07.740
Mom?

01:31:09.070 --> 01:31:10.410
Yeah?

01:31:10.490 --> 01:31:12.830
Will you take care of Stanley for me?

01:31:14.110 --> 01:31:17.990
-I wouldn't have it any other way.
-Check.

01:31:21.250 --> 01:31:22.540
Ah.

01:31:26.420 --> 01:31:27.800

Get it, buddy.

01:32:18.220 --> 01:32:19.970
Hey-

01:32:20.060 --> 01:32:25.310
I was gonna go for a jog up the hill.
Do you want to come?

01:32:25.390 --> 01:32:30.570
-Sure. You start. I'll catch right up.
-Okay.

01:32:32.530 --> 01:32:38.830
Woo! Yeah. Here we go.
Oh, Oh.

01:32:40.490 --> 01:32:42.750
On second thought,
that's a really big hill.

01:32:43.790 --> 01:32:45.460
Pussy.

01:32:46.670 --> 01:32:48.590
I'm not afraid to admit it.

01:32:51.090 --> 01:32:52.680
Ah.

01:32:56.760 --> 01:32:59.600
When's Julian getting here?

01:32:59.680 --> 01:33:02.650
He had to work late,
so I just left a message.

01:33:04.680 --> 01:33:07.360
Trying to let the poor man sleep.

01:33:13.690 --> 01:33:15.070
-Sarah?
-Hm?

01:33:15.150 --> 01:33:16.620
I'm sorry.

01:33:17.490 --> 01:33:20.120
-What?
-I've been so wrapped up in all this,

01:33:20.200 --> 01:33:24.450
I haven't stopped to ask how
it was affecting all of you guys.

01:33:24.540 --> 01:33:27.130
-Oh, that's...
-Ask how you're doing.

01:33:27.210 --> 01:33:30.510
-It's...
-How are you're doing?

01:33:37.050 --> 01:33:39.390
How are you doing?

01:33:41.930 --> 01:33:43.520
Not so good.

01:33:45.020 --> 01:33:48.360
See?
I didn't know that.

01:33:48.440 --> 01:33:52.030
Why didn't you wish
not to die, huh?

01:33:53.440 --> 01:33:55.990
Hm, something else I wanted more.

01:33:56.070 --> 01:34:01.830
Well, I wish it.
I wish it right now. God?

01:34:01.910 --> 01:34:06.790
Hey? God?
You listening?

01:34:08.540 --> 01:34:11.880
You can't take her away.
Okay?

01:34:13.460 --> 01:34:15.880
I want her to stay here.

01:34:17.380 --> 01:34:22.010
It's not gonna work. You need
an anal probe and a morphine shooter.

01:34:30.560 --> 01:34:34.110
-Are you scared?
-No.

01:34:37.440 --> 01:34:39.040
Not anymore.

01:35:09.930 --> 01:35:11.530
Marley?

01:35:14.810 --> 01:35:16.240
Marley?

01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:23.950
Marley?

01:35:27.450 --> 01:35:28.950
Hey-

01:35:30.290 --> 01:35:32.710
Marley...

01:35:58.770 --> 01:36:00.280
Here you go, sir.

01:36:01.940 --> 01:36:03.490
This is Peter.

01:36:09.830 --> 01:36:11.580
Ahh!

01:37:13.810 --> 01:37:16.530
Hey you, it's me.

01:37:17.980 --> 01:37:22.480
Oh, I didn't think
this was going to be so difficult.

01:37:22.570 --> 01:37:26.200
I thank God you came into my life.
I do.

01:37:26.280 --> 01:37:28.870
Because you showed me
how to be the person

01:37:28.950 --> 01:37:32.450
I always imagined myself to be.

01:37:32.530 --> 01:37:34.630
That's not even
giving you enough credit,

01:37:34.700 --> 01:37:38.500
because until I met you
I had no idea who I could be.

01:37:39.960 --> 01:37:46.090
So-- take care and try
not to fall in love again. Ever.

01:37:46.170 --> 01:37:47.850
Ever again.

01:37:49.840 --> 01:37:51.470
That's kind of a joke.

01:37:53.100 --> 01:37:55.690
-I love you.
-I love you.

01:38:12.570 --> 01:38:17.630
Oh, oh, oh.
I know.

01:38:51.030 --> 01:38:54.500
(voice over Marley)
So, that's my story.

01:38:54.570 --> 01:38:57.920
I had some pretty amazing friends,
didn't I?

01:38:57.990 --> 01:39:02.370
And I include my parents in that group,
even though my whole life I blamed them

01:39:02.460 --> 01:39:04.930
for, well, everything.

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:10.800
But the truth is: I was afraid.
I was afraid to trust and forgive.

01:39:10.880 --> 01:39:14.680
I was scared I wasn't enough.
But I was.

01:39:31.780 --> 01:39:34.530
(Julian): I just have to say: To Marley.

01:39:34.610 --> 01:39:36.370
(Everyone): To Marley!

01:40:14.820 --> 01:40:17.370
-Thank you, Marley.
-Thank you, Marley.

01:40:21.830 --> 01:40:23.250
Hi.

01:40:30.840 --> 01:40:32.260
Stanley.

01:40:44.680 --> 01:40:47.360
(voice over Marley)
What I wouldn't give

01:40:47.440 --> 01:40:52.660
to experience just one more time,
to feel that incredible sensation

01:40:54.360 --> 01:40:58.990
when he looked at me
and I felt-- alive.
