00:11.489 --> 00:14.057
Previously onBull...Hey, there, Dr. Bull.

00:14.101 --> 00:16.668
BULL:
Why, Diana Lindsay.

00:16.712 --> 00:18.670
DIANA:
You miss me?

00:18.714 --> 00:20.585
I didn't know
you did criminal law.You should know by now

00:20.629 --> 00:22.892
I am full of surprises.

00:22.935 --> 00:24.241
MARISSA:
Diana's gonna be here
Saturday morning

00:24.285 --> 00:26.461
and she sounds
pretty damned excited to me.

00:26.504 --> 00:28.071
Excellent.Are you all right?
You sound strange.

00:28.115 --> 00:29.812
I saw Izzy at the funeral.

00:29.855 --> 00:31.205
I'm sorry about your dad.

00:31.248 --> 00:32.467
I didn't know what to do.

00:32.510 --> 00:34.077
MARISSA:
What did you want to do?

00:34.121 --> 00:35.557
BULL:
I wanted to save her.

00:35.600 --> 00:37.124
IZZY:
I'm pregnant,

00:37.167 --> 00:38.125
you big Bull.

00:50.702 --> 00:53.705
Hey, Greta.Hey.

00:53.749 --> 00:56.273
Is there any chance you can walk
Sunshine for me this afternoon?

00:56.317 --> 00:58.362
Oh, shoot,
this afternoon is tough.

00:58.406 --> 00:59.798
I have some people
coming for book club.

00:59.842 --> 01:01.974
No problem. I'll figure it out.

01:02.018 --> 01:04.281
I-Is everything okay?

01:04.325 --> 01:07.197
There's just something
I need to do,

01:07.241 --> 01:09.025
and the kids have
after-school stuff,

01:09.069 --> 01:11.593
and Frederick...

01:11.636 --> 01:15.075
well... Frederick has plans
to go sleep with some whore.

01:15.118 --> 01:18.687
Oh, my God, Greta, I'm so sorry.

01:18.730 --> 01:20.428
I just found out.

01:20.471 --> 01:23.648
But I think he's been
seeing her for a while.

01:23.692 --> 01:26.390
[exhales]
That's awful.

01:26.434 --> 01:28.262
I'm going to go confront her.

01:28.305 --> 01:29.654
That's why I need someone
to walk Sunshine.

01:29.698 --> 01:30.829
Are you really sure
you want to do that?

01:30.873 --> 01:33.441
Maybe-maybe take a beat.

01:33.484 --> 01:35.617
I need that woman
to look me in the face.

01:35.660 --> 01:37.836
See that I am
a real person.

01:37.880 --> 01:40.926
That she is hurting me,
hurting my family.

01:40.970 --> 01:43.625
Okay. I'll walk Sunshine.

01:43.668 --> 01:45.148
Don't worry.

01:45.192 --> 01:48.934
Thank you. Thank you so much.

01:53.504 --> 01:55.289
[siren wailing]

01:57.726 --> 01:59.510
[ragged exhale]

01:59.554 --> 02:00.555
[camera shutter clicks]

02:02.774 --> 02:04.689
OFFICER:
The victim's name is Greta Page.

02:04.733 --> 02:07.170
43 years old.
Looks like she was stabbed,

02:07.214 --> 02:08.519
but we haven't
located the weapon.

02:08.563 --> 02:09.912
This her home?

02:09.955 --> 02:11.131
Vacation home, yeah.

02:12.741 --> 02:14.308
Who's that?

02:14.351 --> 02:16.701
OFFICER:Vic's husband.
Frederick Page.

02:16.745 --> 02:19.008
Said he found her like this.

02:28.670 --> 02:30.324
Mr. Page.

02:31.325 --> 02:32.804
Detective Fletcher.

02:32.848 --> 02:35.285
I'm very sorry for your loss.

02:35.329 --> 02:38.680
I was told this is
your vacation home.

02:38.723 --> 02:40.725
Did anyone know you and
your wife would be here today?

02:43.859 --> 02:45.774
Greta wasn't supposed
to be here.

02:46.775 --> 02:48.385
What do you mean?

02:49.734 --> 02:52.781
I might as well just tell you.

02:52.824 --> 02:54.174
I've been having an affair.

02:57.786 --> 03:00.745
I was supposed
to meet her, here.

03:02.704 --> 03:04.053
But instead...

03:05.794 --> 03:07.970
...I found my wife.

03:08.013 --> 03:10.625
Like that.

03:13.105 --> 03:15.412
I'm gonna need the name
of this woman.

03:15.456 --> 03:18.023
Come on. Where are you?

03:20.374 --> 03:21.723
Aren't you supposed

03:21.766 --> 03:23.420
to be on vacation?[phone ringing]

03:23.464 --> 03:26.641
Yeah. We don't fly out
till tonight.

03:26.684 --> 03:29.209
What the heck? My passport
was right here last night.

03:29.252 --> 03:31.123
It was here and it's gone now!

03:31.167 --> 03:32.777
You gonna get that?

03:32.821 --> 03:34.562
No, I'm officially
off the clock.

03:34.605 --> 03:37.521
Where are you,
you government document?

03:37.565 --> 03:38.609
It's got to be here somewhere.

03:38.653 --> 03:40.959
Aha.

03:41.003 --> 03:43.048
Uh, nice filing system.Oh! Nice.

03:43.092 --> 03:44.528
Eagle eye.

03:44.572 --> 03:46.356
Izzy would've
killed me.For Pete's sake.

03:48.315 --> 03:49.968
[mouthing]Marissa Morgan speaking.

03:50.012 --> 03:51.535
Oh, Diana, hi.

03:51.579 --> 03:53.189
Oh, it's
Diana Lindsay.

03:53.233 --> 03:54.321
She's at Rikers.

03:56.627 --> 03:58.063
[whispers]:
I cannot take another case
right now.

03:58.107 --> 04:00.240
Tell her I'll be back
in two weeks.

04:00.283 --> 04:01.371
Well, unfortunately, Bull is...

04:02.764 --> 04:05.027
Oh, my God.

04:05.070 --> 04:06.420
What? What is it?

04:06.463 --> 04:09.118
Diana's been arrested.
For murder.

04:10.946 --> 04:11.990
[lock buzzes]

04:16.038 --> 04:17.692
[laughs softly]

04:17.735 --> 04:20.608
When I moved to New York, I...

04:20.651 --> 04:22.044
I always thought I'd run
into you in the courtroom.

04:24.264 --> 04:26.657
I... never thought it'd be here.

04:26.701 --> 04:27.876
You always did know

04:27.919 --> 04:29.269
the classiest joints.

04:31.227 --> 04:32.707
You okay?

04:34.448 --> 04:35.492
[quietly]:
Yeah.

04:36.754 --> 04:37.929
Hey.[bang on door]

04:37.973 --> 04:39.714
GUARD:
No touching.

04:41.324 --> 04:42.673
[exhales]

04:44.153 --> 04:45.415
Thank you for coming.

04:45.459 --> 04:46.721
Of course.

04:46.764 --> 04:48.375
So, what happened?

04:50.855 --> 04:52.074
Okay, um...

04:55.512 --> 05:00.561
I've been seeing this guy
Frederick about a year now.

05:00.604 --> 05:04.129
And, uh...
Well, we work at the same firm.

05:06.567 --> 05:09.396
[laughs softly]

05:09.439 --> 05:10.788
Well, he's married.

05:10.832 --> 05:13.617
But he swore

05:13.661 --> 05:15.489
that his marriage was over.

05:15.532 --> 05:17.882
That his wife is crazy
and she had a drinking problem

05:17.926 --> 05:21.146
and they were only staying
together for the kids.

05:25.412 --> 05:28.066
[scoffs] Clearly,
I have terrible taste in men.

05:28.110 --> 05:30.504
Well, I could have
told you that years ago.

05:33.724 --> 05:34.986
Anyway...

05:38.163 --> 05:40.644
They found his wife dead

05:40.688 --> 05:43.081
and I was arrested.

05:43.125 --> 05:44.692
What do you think
the police have on you?

05:45.693 --> 05:48.522
[sighs]

05:48.565 --> 05:50.350
I was with her,
right before she died.

05:52.569 --> 05:55.006
I was meeting Frederick
at his weekend place,

05:55.050 --> 05:58.488
and I got there before him, but
you know, I have a key, so...

06:00.838 --> 06:03.188
She was there, waiting on me.

06:03.232 --> 06:05.103
So she knew you were coming?

06:05.147 --> 06:08.019
I mean, I guess
she found out about us and...

06:08.063 --> 06:10.805
well, apparently, it was news to
her that her marriage was over

06:10.848 --> 06:14.504
because that woman
just flipped out on me.

06:14.548 --> 06:15.984
Flipped out?
You mean she attacked you?

06:16.027 --> 06:17.507
No.

06:19.596 --> 06:21.163
Well, uh, she did grab
my arm at one point

06:21.206 --> 06:23.252
to keep me from leaving, but...

06:23.295 --> 06:25.210
yeah, mostly,
she was just yelling at me.

06:25.254 --> 06:27.517
I tried to talk to her, but...

06:27.561 --> 06:30.564
she wouldn't listen, so...
[scoffs]

06:30.607 --> 06:33.349
finally, I just,
I got myself out of there.

06:33.393 --> 06:34.568
And where did you go next?

06:34.611 --> 06:37.788
I went home. I got drunk.

06:39.181 --> 06:40.225
Felt like a fool
for believing

06:40.269 --> 06:42.227
any of Frederick's lies.

06:44.621 --> 06:47.145
I woke up with the police
pounding at my door.

06:48.190 --> 06:50.497
So, you said you were

06:50.540 --> 06:51.933
supposed to meet Frederick

06:51.976 --> 06:54.196
at the house?Yeah.

06:54.239 --> 06:55.980
You think he's capable
of doing this?

06:56.024 --> 06:57.591
Killing someone?

06:57.634 --> 07:01.159
No. No, absolutely not.

07:01.203 --> 07:02.944
He's capable of deception.

07:02.987 --> 07:05.207
He's a liar.I just don't see it.

07:05.250 --> 07:08.602
Frederick, he might be a liar,
but he is not a violent person.

07:10.342 --> 07:11.561
Are you in love with him?

07:13.694 --> 07:16.261
Somehow that question
seems a little unfair.

07:16.305 --> 07:19.221
It goes to motive.
You know that.

07:20.570 --> 07:23.312
No. I'm not in love with him.

07:25.053 --> 07:26.576
[inhales sharply]

07:26.620 --> 07:29.449
I've only been in love
once in my life,

07:29.492 --> 07:32.060
and when he ghosted me

07:32.103 --> 07:35.411
and I found out that he got
back together with his ex-wife

07:35.455 --> 07:39.589
and had a baby,
I didn't murder anyone.

07:40.808 --> 07:42.462
I'm sorry.

07:44.855 --> 07:47.771
[exhales]
I...

07:47.815 --> 07:50.861
could've handled
all that better.

07:52.167 --> 07:54.691
Jason, just get me out of here.

08:02.830 --> 08:04.919
IZZY:
[gasps] Thank God,
you're home.

08:04.962 --> 08:06.442
I was starting to worry
we were gonna miss our flight.

08:06.486 --> 08:09.097
Okay, um, you grab the bags

08:09.140 --> 08:11.534
and I will grab Astrid
and I'll meet you downstairs.

08:11.578 --> 08:14.058
Izzy, I'm sorry,
there's a problem.[gasps]

08:14.102 --> 08:16.104
You lost your passport,
didn't you?

08:16.147 --> 08:17.540
It's work.

08:18.672 --> 08:20.543
Jason, no, you promised.

08:20.587 --> 08:22.153
I know.
You said we were
gonna go on this trip

08:22.197 --> 08:24.373
no matter what came up.

08:24.416 --> 08:25.853
That's true,
but I just never imagined...You said that we deserved

08:25.896 --> 08:28.508
a big, fat vacation after
the year that we've had.

08:28.551 --> 08:29.639
You said we'd be
basking in the sun and...

08:29.683 --> 08:32.424
Diana Lindsay
was arrested for murder.

08:32.468 --> 08:34.557
What?Diana Lindsay

08:34.601 --> 08:36.472
is this lawyer I used to date.

08:36.516 --> 08:38.866
No, I know who Diana is.

08:38.909 --> 08:40.911
She was arrested for murder?

08:40.955 --> 08:42.347
Yes.

08:42.391 --> 08:44.654
Who are they saying
she murdered?

08:46.395 --> 08:48.615
Her boyfriend's wife.

08:51.443 --> 08:53.489
Let me get this straight.

08:53.533 --> 08:56.579
You want to cancel our vacation

08:56.623 --> 08:58.929
so that you can defend
your ex-girlfriend

08:58.973 --> 09:01.584
for murdering her lover's wife?

09:01.628 --> 09:04.065
I know it's not ideal...Why do youhave
to defend her?

09:04.108 --> 09:06.154
Diana's a lawyer,
surely she knows other firms.

09:06.197 --> 09:09.592
Because I know what it feels
like to be wrongly accused.

09:09.636 --> 09:11.725
Remember how hard it was for me
to find someone I trusted?

09:11.768 --> 09:13.422
Of course I remember.
I haven't forgotten

09:13.465 --> 09:15.337
a single second
of that damn trial,

09:15.380 --> 09:17.426
which is why I need a vacation.

09:17.469 --> 09:18.775
That's why we need a vacation.

09:18.819 --> 09:20.951
I know.

09:20.995 --> 09:23.606
Okay.

09:23.650 --> 09:25.608
I won't take this case
if you don't want me to.

09:25.652 --> 09:27.958
Mm-mm, no.

09:28.002 --> 09:30.526
Don't do that to me.
Don't put this on me.

09:30.570 --> 09:33.137
I'm not gonna ask you
not to represent her.

09:33.181 --> 09:36.619
You know, you do whatever
you feel that you need to do.

09:36.663 --> 09:39.448
Just doesn't mean
I have to be happy about it.

09:41.537 --> 09:42.930
[sighs]

09:42.973 --> 09:44.758
♪

09:54.985 --> 09:56.813
Have a good day.You, too.

09:58.772 --> 10:00.425
Everything okay?

10:00.469 --> 10:02.123
We're supposed to be on
a beach in Saint Bart's,

10:02.166 --> 10:03.603
instead we're here, so no.Right.

10:03.646 --> 10:05.039
Well, let's make it worth it.

10:05.082 --> 10:07.171
I'll gather the troops.

10:07.215 --> 10:08.782
TAYLOR: The M.E. puts
Greta Page's time of death

10:08.825 --> 10:10.784
between 2:30 and 3:30 p.m.

10:10.827 --> 10:14.614
Ring camera footage shows Greta
arriving at the house at 2:01.

10:14.657 --> 10:19.967
Diana arrived at 2:23 and left
about 20 minutes later at 2:42.

10:20.010 --> 10:22.752
Then Frederick Page
showed up at 3:17.

10:22.796 --> 10:25.189
He called 911 just
five minutes later.

10:25.233 --> 10:26.800
Well, five minutes is tight,
but it's enough time

10:26.843 --> 10:29.498
to kill his wife
and make a phone call.

10:29.541 --> 10:31.543
Yeah, that's possible,
but what if

10:31.587 --> 10:34.155
it was a-a burglary gone wrong?

10:34.198 --> 10:35.591
Half an hour passes

10:35.635 --> 10:37.419
between the time
that Diana left the house

10:37.462 --> 10:38.812
and Frederick arrived there.

10:38.855 --> 10:39.769
Maybe somebody
walked in the back door.

10:39.813 --> 10:40.988
DANNY:
I don't think so.

10:41.031 --> 10:42.990
The house backs up to the ocean.

10:43.033 --> 10:44.295
There's no security camera
in the back,

10:44.339 --> 10:45.732
but the neighbors
on both sides

10:45.775 --> 10:47.255
have cameras.

10:47.298 --> 10:49.474
No one crossed their
beaches at that time.

10:49.518 --> 10:51.215
So it looks like there
were only two people

10:51.259 --> 10:52.564
who could've killed Greta.

10:52.608 --> 10:54.654
Diana or Frederick.

10:54.697 --> 10:55.959
Well, then, it was Frederick.

10:56.003 --> 10:57.439
So, what about
the M.E.'s report?

10:57.482 --> 10:58.875
Is there anything
about this killer

10:58.919 --> 11:02.009
being taller than Diana,
or left-handed,

11:02.052 --> 11:03.793
because Diana said
Frederick's left-handed.

11:03.837 --> 11:04.968
TAYLOR:
No.

11:05.012 --> 11:06.491
But there was some DNA evidence

11:06.535 --> 11:07.841
in the police report.

11:07.884 --> 11:09.886
Greta's blood was found
on Diana's jacket.

11:09.930 --> 11:11.801
BULL: Well, Diana said
that Greta grabbed

11:11.845 --> 11:13.673
her arm at one point.

11:13.716 --> 11:15.631
Maybe she had a cut on her hand.CHUNK:
That's possible,

11:15.675 --> 11:18.286
but convincing a jury of that,
not so sure.

11:18.329 --> 11:20.854
Did they get anything
off the murder weapon?

11:20.897 --> 11:23.117
Uh, no. The police
haven't found one yet,

11:23.160 --> 11:24.422
but a knife consistent

11:24.466 --> 11:26.686
with Greta's stab wounds

11:26.729 --> 11:28.122
is missing from a set
in the kitchen.

11:28.165 --> 11:29.514
The knife block

11:29.558 --> 11:31.342
has Diana's fingerprints
all over it.

11:31.386 --> 11:33.301
But none of Frederick's.BULL:
Well, okay.

11:33.344 --> 11:34.345
Maybe Diana's the one
who does all the cooking

11:34.389 --> 11:35.825
when they're at the house.

11:35.869 --> 11:37.174
Or maybe Frederick
grabbed the knife

11:37.218 --> 11:38.480
off the counter.

11:38.523 --> 11:39.786
All I'm hearing
is evidence

11:39.829 --> 11:41.570
against Diana.

11:41.613 --> 11:43.746
I'd like to hear some evidence
against Frederick.

11:43.790 --> 11:45.661
We are working on it, Bull.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.271
We have to identify
the weaknesses in our own case.

11:47.315 --> 11:48.795
You're right.

11:48.838 --> 11:51.362
But just so we're clear,
I know Diana.

11:53.582 --> 11:55.366
She did not murder anyone.

11:55.410 --> 11:57.238
[phone vibrating]

11:59.414 --> 12:01.895
A new A.D.A. was just
assigned to the case.

12:03.853 --> 12:05.463
Who is it?

12:07.465 --> 12:08.858
How did this happen?

12:08.902 --> 12:10.904
I had a craving
for orange chicken.

12:10.947 --> 12:13.167
I'm not proud of it,
but it's not that complicated.

12:13.210 --> 12:15.691
You knew that I'm representing
Diana Lindsay. What...

12:15.735 --> 12:17.519
Look, the A.D.A.
handling the case

12:17.562 --> 12:19.390
had emergency gallbladder
surgery today.

12:19.434 --> 12:22.132
The D.A. himself
asked me to step in.

12:22.176 --> 12:24.308
Look, this case
is very personal to TAC.

12:24.352 --> 12:26.658
We've all worked with Diana
and she's very important

12:26.702 --> 12:27.834
to Bull.This is a big

12:27.877 --> 12:29.966
murder case.

12:30.010 --> 12:32.621
It is a major
career opportunity for me.

12:32.664 --> 12:34.536
[sighs]Look, I-I wouldn't have

12:34.579 --> 12:36.190
even considered
taking on the case

12:36.233 --> 12:37.931
if I didn't think our
relationship could handle it.

12:37.974 --> 12:39.889
It's just work.

12:39.933 --> 12:41.761
We'll leave it in the courtroom,
I promise.

12:42.805 --> 12:45.329
[exhales]
Okay, fine.

12:45.373 --> 12:46.766
But we're gonna have
to be very careful

12:46.809 --> 12:48.419
about maintaining boundaries.

12:48.463 --> 12:50.117
Fine. That's fine.

12:50.160 --> 12:53.424
Oh. Wait, does this mean
I can't call you my boo

12:53.468 --> 12:54.643
in front of the jury?

12:54.686 --> 12:56.776
Is that a... It's a no? Yeah.

13:04.566 --> 13:07.047
Hey, uh, do you have a minute?

13:07.090 --> 13:09.440
Our first witness is
about to take the stand.

13:10.702 --> 13:13.096
Uh, but I've got a minute.

13:13.140 --> 13:14.837
[sighs]

13:16.839 --> 13:17.840
Um...

13:20.060 --> 13:22.976
I don't want to put you
in an awkward position.

13:23.019 --> 13:25.935
But, um, I know

13:25.979 --> 13:27.981
that Jason and Diana
have a past.

13:28.024 --> 13:30.679
And normally,
I'm all for just, like,

13:30.722 --> 13:33.029
letting the past stay
in the past, but this one...

13:33.073 --> 13:35.205
[sighs]
this one just isn't.

13:35.249 --> 13:37.468
I'm sure this can't
be easy for you.

13:39.079 --> 13:41.995
Well, I mean, you saw them
when they were together.

13:43.648 --> 13:45.607
Was he in love with her?

13:48.915 --> 13:50.351
Honestly, I don't know.

13:50.394 --> 13:52.614
But I do know

13:52.657 --> 13:54.442
he loves you.

13:54.485 --> 13:55.573
You two...

13:55.617 --> 13:57.619
fit like a glove.

13:57.662 --> 14:00.448
Mm, nothing sexier than a glove.

14:00.491 --> 14:02.319
[knocking on door]TAYLOR:
Sorry to interrupt.

14:02.363 --> 14:04.800
Uh, Rob just called Frederick
Page to the stand. You coming?

14:04.844 --> 14:07.847
[chuckles]:
Go. I'm fine.

14:07.890 --> 14:09.892
If I have learned
anything this year,

14:09.936 --> 14:13.591
it's that, sometimes,
it's okay not to be fine.

14:13.635 --> 14:14.854
Hmm.

14:17.944 --> 14:20.990
Frederick Page, do you swear to
tell the truth, the whole truth,

14:21.034 --> 14:22.818
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

14:22.862 --> 14:24.080
I do.

14:26.126 --> 14:27.344
BULL:
Whatever Frederick says today,

14:27.388 --> 14:29.216
you can't react.

14:29.259 --> 14:30.913
It's not my first rodeo, Jason.

14:30.957 --> 14:33.002
Well, it's your first
rodeo as the accused,

14:33.046 --> 14:35.091
and it's a lot harder
than you think.

14:35.135 --> 14:36.745
ROB:
I want to take you
back to the day

14:36.788 --> 14:39.095
that you found your wife Greta
dead at your beach house.

14:39.139 --> 14:41.097
Now, you hadn't planned
on meeting Greta there

14:41.141 --> 14:42.272
that afternoon, had you?

14:42.316 --> 14:45.058
No. Uh...

14:45.101 --> 14:47.451
I had plans
to meet someone else.

14:47.495 --> 14:48.713
And who was that?

14:48.757 --> 14:51.238
Diana Lindsay.The defendant?

14:51.281 --> 14:53.283
FREDERICK:
Yes.Had you spoken to the defendant

14:53.327 --> 14:54.632
on your way
to the house?

14:54.676 --> 14:55.982
Yes, I-I was running late,

14:56.025 --> 14:57.679
so I-I called to let her know.

14:57.722 --> 14:58.985
But when she answered
the phone,

14:59.028 --> 15:00.638
she was angry.

15:00.682 --> 15:02.553
She said that Greta
was at the beach house

15:02.597 --> 15:04.338
and that she had ambushed her.

15:04.381 --> 15:05.905
ROB:
Did she say
anything else?

15:11.345 --> 15:12.868
Yes.

15:12.912 --> 15:16.089
She said, "Things got ugly,

15:16.132 --> 15:17.742
and now it's your mess
to clean up."

15:17.786 --> 15:19.527
CHUNK:
Objection, Your Honor.

15:19.570 --> 15:21.529
This is blatant hearsay.

15:21.572 --> 15:22.878
It falls under several hearsay
exceptions, Your Honor.

15:22.922 --> 15:24.053
Statement against
penal interest,

15:24.097 --> 15:25.054
excited utterance.

15:25.098 --> 15:26.490
I could go on.

15:26.534 --> 15:27.665
LEAVY:No need.

15:27.709 --> 15:28.710
Overruled.

15:28.753 --> 15:30.320
ROB:
After the defendant said

15:30.364 --> 15:32.670
this was your mess
to clean up, you arrived

15:32.714 --> 15:34.324
at your beach house
to find

15:34.368 --> 15:36.761
your wife Greta
brutally stabbed to death.

15:36.805 --> 15:38.111
Is that correct?

15:38.154 --> 15:38.938
Yes.

15:41.505 --> 15:42.506
No further questions.

15:50.427 --> 15:52.560
Mr. Page,

15:52.603 --> 15:54.649
you were having an affair with
Diana Lindsay, is that correct?

15:54.692 --> 15:56.520
Yes.And did you tell

15:56.564 --> 15:58.348
your wife that you were
sleeping with Ms. Lindsay?

15:58.392 --> 16:00.089
No.

16:00.133 --> 16:01.438
CHUNK:
So you lied to her?

16:01.482 --> 16:02.744
Yes.

16:02.787 --> 16:04.093
So you're a liar?

16:04.137 --> 16:05.529
Yes.

16:05.573 --> 16:06.704
So we only have
the word of a liar

16:06.748 --> 16:08.402
that your wife was already dead

16:08.445 --> 16:09.794
when you got there?

16:09.838 --> 16:11.013
FREDERICK:
But she was. She was...

16:11.057 --> 16:12.536
Or maybe, when you got there,

16:12.580 --> 16:14.147
she was furious.

16:15.670 --> 16:17.106
Did she threaten
to leave you, Mr. Page?

16:17.150 --> 16:18.412
Take your kids?
Take your money?

16:18.455 --> 16:20.501
No. That's not what happened.

16:20.544 --> 16:21.893
Did she threaten to tell
the law firm that you were

16:21.937 --> 16:23.417
having an affair
with a colleague?

16:23.460 --> 16:24.940
And you had
to stop her,

16:24.984 --> 16:26.507
and so you stabbed her to death?

16:26.550 --> 16:27.508
Isn't that what happened,
Mr. Page?

16:27.551 --> 16:28.900
Objection. Inflammatory.

16:28.944 --> 16:29.989
Badgering the witness.

16:30.990 --> 16:32.208
I'm sure you could go on.

16:32.252 --> 16:34.776
I withdraw
the question, Your Honor.

16:34.819 --> 16:36.517
And I'm done
with this witness.

16:38.823 --> 16:39.955
REPORTER:
There she is!

16:39.999 --> 16:41.565
Diana, Diana,
can we get a quote?

16:41.609 --> 16:42.740
Over here, over here.No comment, please.

16:42.784 --> 16:44.351
Did you kill your lover's wife?

16:44.394 --> 16:46.179
Diana, what did you do with...No comment.

16:46.222 --> 16:47.223
Did Greta Page threaten
to expose your affair
at your law firm?

16:47.267 --> 16:49.225
BULL:
No comment.

16:49.269 --> 16:51.358
Have you considered
a guilty plea?

16:51.401 --> 16:53.577
Diana, are you still sleeping
with Dr. Jason Bull?

16:53.621 --> 16:54.404
Can you comment?

17:01.759 --> 17:03.457
[sighs]

17:03.500 --> 17:04.588
Hey.

17:10.377 --> 17:12.248
[exhales]

17:12.292 --> 17:15.034
I am so sorry.

17:17.253 --> 17:20.169
Do you have any idea
how embarrassing this is?

17:20.213 --> 17:21.431
I should've been ahead of this.

17:21.475 --> 17:22.911
Yeah, you should've,

17:22.954 --> 17:23.955
but when it comes to Diana,

17:23.999 --> 17:25.957
your judgment is clearly off.

17:26.001 --> 17:27.742
Off?

17:27.785 --> 17:29.613
Yeah, off.

17:29.657 --> 17:31.093
You're so sure she's innocent,

17:31.137 --> 17:33.182
but Diana's clearly
capable of deception.

17:33.226 --> 17:34.314
Look, I know you're upset
about this picture...

17:34.357 --> 17:36.142
She's been having
an affair for a year.

17:36.185 --> 17:37.665
God knows what else
she's hiding.

17:37.708 --> 17:40.450
Are you worried
that Diana is snowing me?

17:40.494 --> 17:41.886
Or are you afraid
of something else?

17:41.930 --> 17:43.801
Well, should I be afraid
of something else?

17:43.845 --> 17:45.499
I can't believe
I even have to say this,

17:45.542 --> 17:48.371
but I would never be
unfaithful to you.

17:48.415 --> 17:50.156
All I want to do

17:50.199 --> 17:51.505
is represent Diana.

17:53.115 --> 17:55.509
You don't want to represent her.

17:55.552 --> 17:57.076
You want to save her.

18:00.862 --> 18:02.037
ROB:
You never told me

18:02.081 --> 18:04.257
about Bull and Diana.

18:04.300 --> 18:05.867
I told you that she was
very important to Bull.

18:05.910 --> 18:08.826
You failed to mention why.

18:08.870 --> 18:10.306
That was some pretty good dirt

18:10.350 --> 18:11.916
you kept from me, Chester,
and you know it.

18:11.960 --> 18:14.832
No. We agreed that we were
gonna keep things professional.

18:14.876 --> 18:16.095
That means no dirt.

18:17.139 --> 18:18.749
Okay. Yeah.

18:18.793 --> 18:21.274
Fine. If we're gonna be
all professional,

18:21.317 --> 18:24.320
then I have an updated
witness list for you.

18:28.281 --> 18:30.239
Who's Dr. Audrey Birdge?

18:30.283 --> 18:33.286
Oh, that's your job
to figure that out.

18:34.765 --> 18:36.245
[laughs]:
Oh...

18:37.507 --> 18:39.248
My name is Dr. Audrey Birdge.

18:39.292 --> 18:40.815
I'm a forensic pathologist,
more commonly known

18:40.858 --> 18:42.643
as a medical examiner.

18:42.686 --> 18:44.384
And do you have
any specific area of expertise?

18:44.427 --> 18:46.429
AUDREY:
My training includes
a specialization

18:46.473 --> 18:48.649
in hepatology,
which is diseases of the liver.

18:48.692 --> 18:50.129
ROB:
Dr. Birdge, how long

18:50.172 --> 18:52.305
would it take someone
to bleed to death

18:52.348 --> 18:54.742
from a stab wound
to the liver?

18:54.785 --> 18:56.178
If a healthy person was stabbed

18:56.222 --> 18:57.484
at the same depth
as Greta Page's cut,

18:57.527 --> 19:00.182
it would take them
several hours to bleed out.

19:00.226 --> 19:03.185
And was Greta Page
a relatively healthy person?

19:03.229 --> 19:05.100
I'm afraid not.
Her liver showed signs

19:05.144 --> 19:06.928
of advanced cirrhosis,

19:06.971 --> 19:09.017
which is often caused
by heavy drinking.

19:09.060 --> 19:11.411
Cirrhosis prevents
the blood from clotting,

19:11.454 --> 19:13.761
which makes exsanguination
much faster.

19:13.804 --> 19:17.199
So how long would it have taken
for Greta Page to bleed out?

19:17.243 --> 19:20.115
Roughly 30 to 60 minutes.

19:20.159 --> 19:21.682
ROB:
In your expert opinion...

19:21.725 --> 19:23.945
I don't think I like
where this is going.

19:23.988 --> 19:25.512
...could have bled to death
in less than 30 minutes?

19:25.555 --> 19:27.078
It's extremely unlikely.

19:27.122 --> 19:28.254
What about less than 20 minutes?

19:28.297 --> 19:29.298
AUDREY:
No.

19:29.342 --> 19:31.213
I don't believe that's possible.

19:31.257 --> 19:32.214
Yeah, I definitely
don't like it.

19:32.258 --> 19:33.955
It's been previously established

19:33.998 --> 19:36.740
that the paramedics arrived
and pronounced Greta dead

19:36.784 --> 19:38.699
a mere 11 minutes

19:38.742 --> 19:40.614
after Frederick

19:40.657 --> 19:43.182
got to the house,
so are you saying that even

19:43.225 --> 19:44.531
if Frederick had stabbed Greta

19:44.574 --> 19:46.707
the second he arrived
at the house,

19:46.750 --> 19:49.318
uh, she would have
still been alive

19:49.362 --> 19:51.755
by the time
the paramedics arrived?

19:51.799 --> 19:54.193
Yes. She could not have
bled out that quickly.

19:54.236 --> 19:57.979
Meaning that
Frederick Page could not

19:58.022 --> 19:59.633
have killed Greta?Correct.

20:00.851 --> 20:02.940
TAYLOR:
So,

20:02.984 --> 20:05.029
if Frederick
didn't kill Greta, then...

20:05.073 --> 20:07.771
At least I know I wasn't
sleeping with a murderer.

20:07.815 --> 20:09.251
Silver linings.

20:09.295 --> 20:11.427
Well, here's the thing
we know for sure.

20:11.471 --> 20:12.907
Diana didn't do this.

20:12.950 --> 20:15.083
So who did?

20:15.126 --> 20:16.345
Well, let's start
from the beginning.

20:16.389 --> 20:18.304
Were we too quick
to reject the idea

20:18.347 --> 20:20.349
of someone coming in
through the back?

20:20.393 --> 20:22.003
There's no security camera
out there.

20:22.046 --> 20:23.439
DANNY:
Well, like I said before,

20:23.483 --> 20:24.788
they would've had
to walk up the beach.

20:24.832 --> 20:26.007
The neighbors

20:26.050 --> 20:27.269
on both sides
have cameras

20:27.313 --> 20:29.228
that capture the beaches.

20:29.271 --> 20:30.577
Well, they could've come
from the water by boat.

20:30.620 --> 20:32.405
Walked straight up
to the Pages' house.

20:32.448 --> 20:33.971
TAYLOR:I watched the neighbors'
beach footage.

20:34.015 --> 20:35.538
I didn't see a boat, and
between all of the cameras,

20:35.582 --> 20:37.671
I'm pretty sure you can see
the full shoreline

20:37.714 --> 20:39.368
in back of the Pages' house.

20:39.412 --> 20:40.369
Pretty sure or positive?

20:42.589 --> 20:43.981
Y'all excuse me?

20:44.025 --> 20:45.418
I need to use the restroom.

20:50.336 --> 20:51.380
Okay, we need to point
the finger at someone else.

20:51.424 --> 20:52.990
So find me a someone

20:53.034 --> 20:54.078
and a somehow.

20:54.122 --> 20:55.471
Or that jury
is gonna have

20:55.515 --> 20:57.865
no problem
saying Diana is guilty.

20:57.908 --> 20:59.214
And until we do?

20:59.258 --> 21:01.216
What?We're up tomorrow, Bull,

21:01.260 --> 21:03.914
and right now I don't have
anyone to call as a witness.

21:03.958 --> 21:05.438
Well, then, find us a way
to get a continuance.

21:10.312 --> 21:11.313
[water running]

21:11.357 --> 21:12.880
[faucet squeaks]

21:12.923 --> 21:13.924
[sniffles]

21:16.884 --> 21:18.277
Hey.

21:18.320 --> 21:20.017
Hey.

21:29.113 --> 21:31.072
I just want to apologize to you.

21:31.115 --> 21:32.552
I know
that you and Jason

21:32.595 --> 21:33.901
were supposed to be
on vacation and...

21:33.944 --> 21:35.511
[laughs softly]

21:35.555 --> 21:38.862
well, this isn't a vacation.

21:41.169 --> 21:42.388
It happens.

21:45.695 --> 21:47.741
Jason is really good at getting
people out of trouble.

21:49.220 --> 21:50.613
Lord knows I need that.

21:56.924 --> 21:58.708
[coughing][water splashing]

22:01.494 --> 22:02.930
Are you okay?

22:02.973 --> 22:05.106
[coughing]

22:05.149 --> 22:06.934
Diana? Can I,
can I get you anything?

22:06.977 --> 22:09.589
[toilet flushes]

22:09.632 --> 22:11.852
No.

22:11.895 --> 22:14.115
I'm fine.

22:14.158 --> 22:16.552
It's just nerves,
that's all.

22:18.989 --> 22:20.426
Never been accused
of murder before.

22:22.645 --> 22:25.474
Yeah, I used to throw up
all the time, too.

22:25.518 --> 22:28.695
When... When I was pregnant.

22:33.134 --> 22:34.440
Are you...?

22:38.139 --> 22:39.140
[softly]:
Yeah.

22:42.186 --> 22:44.188
Ain't that a kick in the pants?

22:45.189 --> 22:46.539
Yeah.

22:53.154 --> 22:56.505
How long have you known?

22:56.549 --> 23:00.204
I found out the day
before Greta was killed.

23:00.248 --> 23:03.164
Did you tell Frederick?

23:03.207 --> 23:04.208
No.

23:04.252 --> 23:05.906
[exhales]

23:05.949 --> 23:08.212
I didn't know
what I wanted to do. I...

23:08.256 --> 23:10.214
I didn't know if I was even
gonna keep the baby.

23:10.258 --> 23:11.477
I just...

23:11.520 --> 23:13.261
And then this
happened. I...

23:15.394 --> 23:16.699
Diana, you should have
told me this right away.

23:16.743 --> 23:19.223
I know.I asked you

23:19.267 --> 23:21.051
if you were serious
about him and you said no.

23:21.095 --> 23:22.836
You weren't.I wasn't.

23:22.879 --> 23:24.446
Do you know how this
is gonna look to a jury when

23:24.490 --> 23:25.316
they find out that
you're carrying his baby?

23:25.360 --> 23:27.144
Yes.They're gonna think

23:27.188 --> 23:28.711
you killed his wife so that
you could have the father

23:28.755 --> 23:30.539
of the baby
all to yourself.I know.

23:30.583 --> 23:32.280
Why wouldn't you tell me?

23:32.323 --> 23:33.803
Because then it would be real!

23:35.762 --> 23:37.546
And I...

23:37.590 --> 23:38.808
I can't...

23:42.421 --> 23:43.639
[exhales]

23:50.777 --> 23:53.257
I can't think about
having a baby right now

23:53.301 --> 23:56.304
or I'm just gonna lose it, okay?

23:59.786 --> 24:00.787
I always thought if...

24:02.615 --> 24:04.834
...I found out I was pregnant,
it would be a happy thing.

24:04.878 --> 24:07.489
You know?

24:07.533 --> 24:10.666
I could just tell the father
and we'd be so excited together.

24:14.148 --> 24:15.584
But this is...

24:19.980 --> 24:21.460
Did you kill her?

24:24.375 --> 24:26.813
How could you ask me that,
Jason? You know me.

24:26.856 --> 24:28.597
Maybe that's the problem.

24:30.991 --> 24:33.646
Izzy says I don't see things
clearly when it comes to you.

24:35.082 --> 24:36.997
What are you saying?

24:37.040 --> 24:39.478
You told me you used to love me.

24:41.436 --> 24:42.829
And I loved you, too.

24:45.048 --> 24:47.834
Maybe that's why

24:47.877 --> 24:50.010
I don't want to believe
you could have done this.

24:51.272 --> 24:52.621
Jason.So...

24:52.665 --> 24:56.016
if I'm gonna defend you,

24:56.059 --> 24:58.235
you have to tell me
the whole truth.

25:04.198 --> 25:06.243
I didn't kill Greta Page.

25:10.073 --> 25:11.988
CHUNK:
All I'm asking for

25:12.032 --> 25:14.382
is a short continuance to
pursue a new lead, Your Honor.

25:14.425 --> 25:15.644
Three, four days, tops.Your Honor,

25:15.688 --> 25:18.299
as my esteemed colleague
is well aware,

25:18.342 --> 25:20.301
I have another trial on the
docket next week. A continuance

25:20.344 --> 25:22.042
would cause a major conflict.

25:22.085 --> 25:24.131
Should an innocent
woman get convicted

25:24.174 --> 25:25.741
to suit my esteemed
colleague's calendar?

25:25.785 --> 25:27.569
ROB:
That's clearly not
what I'm saying.

25:27.613 --> 25:28.570
Maybe you shouldn't
have taken this case

25:28.614 --> 25:30.093
if your schedule
was so tight.

25:30.137 --> 25:31.878
Gentlemen,
I have a dinner reservation,

25:31.921 --> 25:33.140
so let's wrap this up.

25:33.183 --> 25:35.359
Mr. Palmer,

25:35.403 --> 25:36.709
I'll grant you a continuance.

25:37.927 --> 25:38.972
Thank you,
Your Honor.

25:39.015 --> 25:40.234
For one day.

25:40.277 --> 25:41.975
That's it.

25:42.018 --> 25:44.107
So you're welcome, Mr. Jones.

25:44.151 --> 25:45.282
Thank you, Your Honor.

25:50.026 --> 25:52.507
I thought you said you were okay
with me taking this case.

25:52.551 --> 25:53.639
I am okay with it.Then what's with the dig

25:53.682 --> 25:55.292
about how I shouldn't
have taken the case?

25:55.336 --> 25:57.164
I was making an argument
to get a continuance.

25:57.207 --> 25:58.687
Whoa...

25:58.731 --> 26:00.210
You don't have
a new lead, do you?

26:00.254 --> 26:01.864
Yes, I do.Uh-uh.

26:01.908 --> 26:04.171
Your case is tanking
and you're trying to buy time.

26:04.214 --> 26:06.216
My case isn't tanking
and I have a lead.

26:06.260 --> 26:07.914
A big lead.You're creasing.

26:07.957 --> 26:09.219
What?

26:09.263 --> 26:10.873
When you get stressed,
you get this...

26:10.917 --> 26:12.919
adorable little crease

26:12.962 --> 26:13.876
right there, right between
your eyebrows.I don't have a...

26:13.920 --> 26:15.399
Right now, you are creasing.

26:15.443 --> 26:17.184
No, I don't. This is...
It's my face.

26:17.227 --> 26:19.099
It's what I look like all
the time. It's my face!Hmm.

26:19.142 --> 26:20.883
Well, the mirror and I
respectfully disagree.

26:20.927 --> 26:21.754
Look...

26:23.146 --> 26:24.191
Are we gonna be okay?

26:24.234 --> 26:25.975
When I win?We'll never know,

26:26.019 --> 26:27.716
'cause you're
not gonna win.

26:29.762 --> 26:32.199
Have fun with your "big lead."

26:33.243 --> 26:34.549
I will.

26:53.612 --> 26:54.613
Hey.

26:55.614 --> 26:57.050
Hey.

26:58.312 --> 26:59.269
I didn't think
you'd be up.

26:59.313 --> 27:01.228
What you doing?

27:01.271 --> 27:02.838
Uh, just thinking.

27:03.796 --> 27:05.014
Ah.

27:06.625 --> 27:08.801
Well, I suppose
you know that...

27:10.019 --> 27:11.804
...you were right.

27:11.847 --> 27:15.198
Diana was... hiding
something from me.

27:16.460 --> 27:17.984
I feel sorry for her,

27:18.027 --> 27:20.769
being pregnant on her own,
at a time like this.

27:20.813 --> 27:23.032
Yeah. I think
she's terrified.

27:26.732 --> 27:29.038
You were right about
the other thing, too.

27:31.084 --> 27:32.433
What other thing?

27:34.478 --> 27:36.393
Part of me did...

27:36.437 --> 27:37.830
want to save Diana.

27:39.353 --> 27:40.876
The truth is, I
ended things abruptly

27:40.920 --> 27:43.792
when you and I
got back together.

27:44.880 --> 27:46.969
And there were
unresolved feelings?

27:47.013 --> 27:48.101
Yes.

27:49.711 --> 27:53.236
And I justified taking her
case because I knew that I...

27:53.280 --> 27:55.674
would never cross
a line with her.

27:57.545 --> 28:00.504
You're the only woman
I want to be with.

28:02.463 --> 28:05.640
But it was not fair of me to...

28:05.684 --> 28:07.294
put you in that position,

28:07.337 --> 28:08.687
make you worry.

28:08.730 --> 28:11.646
I wasn't even
really worried about you.

28:11.690 --> 28:14.867
Or... even Diana. I...

28:16.259 --> 28:17.870
[sighs]

28:18.871 --> 28:22.048
You know, when I was pregnant
with Astrid,

28:22.091 --> 28:23.832
things weren't exactly on
the up and up either.

28:23.876 --> 28:27.923
I was... married to Michael.

28:30.099 --> 28:31.710
I was unfaithful.

28:31.753 --> 28:33.146
But you and I were
married before...

28:33.189 --> 28:35.888
I don't think Michael
would appreciate the difference.

28:35.931 --> 28:38.020
I just-- I...

28:38.064 --> 28:41.241
I sometimes feel
like something's coming to me.

28:42.546 --> 28:44.592
Punishment for my sins.

28:44.635 --> 28:47.508
I don't think the world
really works like that.

28:48.814 --> 28:51.555
[sighs]People don't get what
they deserve, good or bad.

28:52.556 --> 28:54.123
Well...
[scoffs]

28:54.167 --> 28:55.864
you're not Catholic.

28:55.908 --> 28:57.605
That's true.

28:57.648 --> 28:59.085
Well, if you want to
bring God into this,

28:59.128 --> 29:00.564
all you have to do
is look at our...

29:00.608 --> 29:03.045
beautiful daughter
to know the Almighty

29:03.089 --> 29:06.266
is just fine with
our shenanigans.

29:06.309 --> 29:08.529
"Shenanigans"?

29:08.572 --> 29:10.749
Yes. That's what the kids
are calling it these days.

29:13.316 --> 29:16.363
I would never want to
mess up what we have.

29:16.406 --> 29:18.191
Me neither.

29:20.889 --> 29:23.109
And for what it's worth, I...

29:24.371 --> 29:26.590
I really hope
you can save Diana.

29:28.114 --> 29:29.637
Me, too.

29:35.338 --> 29:36.165
Veronica Davis?

29:37.427 --> 29:39.516
Yes?

29:39.560 --> 29:41.562
My name's Danny James. I'm an
investigator working on behalf

29:41.605 --> 29:42.868
of the woman accused
of killing Greta Page.

29:42.911 --> 29:44.870
Not interested.

29:44.913 --> 29:46.915
I just have a
few questions.No.

29:46.959 --> 29:48.221
You're gonna try
and pin this on me.

29:48.264 --> 29:50.266
Why would you say that?You wouldn't be here

29:50.310 --> 29:52.225
if you didn't already know
that Greta Page ruined my life.

29:52.268 --> 29:54.183
But, sorry,

29:54.227 --> 29:55.794
I didn't kill her.Well, maybe you
can just help me

29:55.837 --> 29:57.578
understand Greta
a little better.

29:57.621 --> 29:59.406
I heard that
she got you fired

29:59.449 --> 30:00.624
after you kicked her daughter
off the volleyball team.

30:00.668 --> 30:01.756
That must'vesucked.

30:01.800 --> 30:02.801
"Sucked"?

30:04.280 --> 30:05.542
I almost went to jail.

30:05.586 --> 30:07.153
Jail? Why?

30:07.196 --> 30:08.850
[scoffs]

30:08.894 --> 30:10.852
I guess you didn't do
your homework.

30:10.896 --> 30:11.897
Well, not well enough, I guess.

30:15.901 --> 30:17.250
Are you gonna educate me

30:17.293 --> 30:19.034
or should I talk
to your boss?

30:19.078 --> 30:20.340
I'm sure you wouldn't
be working here

30:20.383 --> 30:21.994
if you had an easy
time getting a job.

30:26.737 --> 30:29.915
I kicked Greta Page's kid off
of the team

30:29.958 --> 30:31.525
because she was late.

30:31.568 --> 30:32.569
Every day.

30:32.613 --> 30:34.528
And that woman went

30:34.571 --> 30:36.443
ballistic.

30:36.486 --> 30:39.272
She demanded
the school fire me, but...

30:39.315 --> 30:40.708
school backed me up.

30:40.751 --> 30:43.406
Next thing I know,
I'm getting pulled over

30:43.450 --> 30:46.583
in the school parking lot
because of an anonymous tip,

30:46.627 --> 30:49.369
and the cops found cocaine
in my car.

30:49.412 --> 30:50.544
So you think Greta
planted the drugs?

30:50.587 --> 30:52.285
I think
that psycho

30:52.328 --> 30:53.852
would do whatever it takes
to get what she wants.

30:55.549 --> 30:57.812
Do we know for sure
that Greta really did that?

30:57.856 --> 31:00.032
Because planting drugs
on someone

31:00.075 --> 31:02.817
for kicking your kid
off the volleyball team is--

31:02.861 --> 31:05.341
I-I... I don't even
know what that is.

31:05.385 --> 31:07.691
Frederick always said
his wife could be vindictive.

31:07.735 --> 31:10.129
BULL:Doesn't matter whether
Greta really did it.

31:10.172 --> 31:13.088
Veronica Davis thinks she did
it, which gives her motive.

31:13.132 --> 31:15.743
We can put her in front of the
jury as an alternate suspect.

31:15.786 --> 31:17.310
Yeah, that's not gonna go
so well for us.

31:17.353 --> 31:19.921
To avoid
jail time,

31:19.965 --> 31:22.097
Veronica's been doing a
court-ordered sobriety program.

31:22.141 --> 31:23.925
She was there
at the time of the murder.

31:23.969 --> 31:25.927
So the suspect list
is down to me again.

31:25.971 --> 31:27.407
Pretty much.

31:29.148 --> 31:31.498
Maybe that's the point.DIANA:
How so?

31:31.541 --> 31:33.326
Well, you've always been
the obvious suspect here.

31:33.369 --> 31:34.849
Right? So maybe

31:34.893 --> 31:37.112
Greta wanted it that way.

31:37.156 --> 31:39.245
Maybe she framed
you the way

31:39.288 --> 31:40.463
she framed
that coach.

31:40.507 --> 31:41.508
She grabbed you
by the arm

31:41.551 --> 31:43.075
maybe to put blood on you.

31:44.467 --> 31:45.991
[chuckles softly]

31:46.034 --> 31:48.471
You think that woman
hated me so much

31:48.515 --> 31:50.299
that she'd be willing to die
to set me up?

31:50.343 --> 31:52.475
Maybe she didn't
plan on dying.

31:52.519 --> 31:54.260
Maybe she just wanted
to wound herself,

31:54.303 --> 31:57.785
blame you and then he
goes running back to her.

31:57.828 --> 31:59.787
That seems pretty
complicated.

31:59.830 --> 32:01.049
I mean, didn't Greta
tell her neighbor

32:01.093 --> 32:02.355
that she had
just found out

32:02.398 --> 32:04.009
about Frederick's
affair that day?

32:04.052 --> 32:05.358
Actually, she didn't.

32:05.401 --> 32:06.750
When I was examining
Greta's devices,

32:06.794 --> 32:08.317
I discovered that she spoofed

32:08.361 --> 32:10.319
Frederick's phone
last summer.

32:10.363 --> 32:11.799
She'd seen all
of his texts.

32:11.842 --> 32:12.931
She knew about the
affair for months.

32:12.974 --> 32:15.281
So why lie to your neighbor,

32:15.324 --> 32:16.543
unless you're planning
something?

32:16.586 --> 32:18.066
DANNY:
I kind of see

32:18.110 --> 32:19.459
a big problem
with this whole theory.

32:19.502 --> 32:21.330
The knife.

32:21.374 --> 32:24.333
How does a dead woman dispose
of her own murder weapon?

32:24.377 --> 32:25.682
BULL:Well, if she planned
this in advance,

32:25.726 --> 32:26.683
then she
would've planned

32:26.727 --> 32:28.468
a hiding place in advance.

32:28.511 --> 32:30.600
A place the police
would not think of searching.

32:30.644 --> 32:33.212
Maybe you can...I'll head to the house
and start searching.

32:33.255 --> 32:34.474
Okay. And, you know,
we don't have a lot of time,

32:34.517 --> 32:35.910
so...I'll go, too.

32:37.303 --> 32:38.695
Thank you.

32:38.739 --> 32:40.349
Don't thank us yet.

32:43.962 --> 32:45.311
Searched the patio
high and low.

32:45.354 --> 32:47.313
That knife is
not out there.

32:47.356 --> 32:49.141
I really wanted it to be...

32:49.184 --> 32:51.143
hidden inside Slicing
& Dicing with Jimmy.

32:51.186 --> 32:52.579
Because of the title?

32:52.622 --> 32:53.797
Because of the title.

32:53.841 --> 32:55.495
It was the last one
on the shelf.

32:57.018 --> 33:00.239
Well, the knife's either
in the patio or the kitchen.

33:00.282 --> 33:01.980
Those are the only two places
they found Greta's blood.

33:03.459 --> 33:06.071
Or Diana walked out with it
and dumped it in the ocean.

33:06.114 --> 33:07.333
We're not going there.

33:08.595 --> 33:09.683
Did you check the dishwasher?

33:09.726 --> 33:11.598
Right when I got here.

33:11.641 --> 33:13.165
Good. That would've
been embarrassing.

33:14.427 --> 33:16.646
Look at how happy they look
in their pictures.

33:16.690 --> 33:19.519
It's hard to believe their
marriage is so terrible.

33:19.562 --> 33:21.042
People are always more
messed up than you think.

33:21.086 --> 33:22.913
That's what keeps us employed.

33:22.957 --> 33:24.350
[chuckles]:
Yeah.

33:25.873 --> 33:28.615
You ever wish you were
a children's librarian?

33:29.746 --> 33:31.052
Taylor.

33:31.096 --> 33:32.140
I'm not gonna
quit or anything.

33:32.184 --> 33:33.228
No, check this out.

33:34.490 --> 33:36.840
Maybe this is how Greta
got rid of the knife.

33:36.884 --> 33:38.755
You think she
used her son

33:38.799 --> 33:40.192
to get rid of the
knife? That's dark.

33:40.235 --> 33:41.236
No. Look.

33:41.280 --> 33:43.064
The science fair project.

33:43.108 --> 33:45.675
This kid used
a weather balloon

33:45.719 --> 33:47.373
to launch a camera
into outer space.

33:47.416 --> 33:50.028
Now, a knife is much lighter
than that camera.

33:51.594 --> 33:53.466
BULL:
She used

33:53.509 --> 33:56.469
a weather balloon
to dispose of a murder weapon?

33:56.512 --> 33:58.688
I thought it sounded
like a stretch, too.

33:58.732 --> 34:00.647
But then I took another look at
the neighbors' security footage

34:00.690 --> 34:02.214
of the beach.
Look what I saw

34:02.257 --> 34:04.999
just a few minutes
after Diana left the house.

34:07.219 --> 34:08.524
Okay.

34:08.568 --> 34:09.786
All I see

34:09.830 --> 34:10.787
is water and sky.

34:10.831 --> 34:12.093
Wait for it.

34:13.355 --> 34:16.228
There. Looks an awful lot
like a weather balloon to me.

34:16.271 --> 34:18.099
Greta's body was
found on the patio.

34:18.143 --> 34:20.232
We think she went out there
to launch the balloon.

34:20.275 --> 34:21.842
There's a shed
in the back

34:21.885 --> 34:23.104
where that balloon
could've been stashed,

34:23.148 --> 34:24.888
blown up and ready. It tracks.

34:24.932 --> 34:27.848
Truth is stranger
than fiction.

34:27.891 --> 34:30.459
But is it gonna sound
like science fiction to a jury?

34:30.503 --> 34:32.244
[exhales]

34:32.287 --> 34:35.290
Not if it comes from the
person who knew Greta best.

34:43.342 --> 34:44.430
[scoffs]

34:44.473 --> 34:45.735
What are you saying?

34:46.954 --> 34:50.262
You think...
Greta stabbed herself

34:50.305 --> 34:51.959
to get revenge on Diana?

34:52.002 --> 34:53.482
I'm asking if you think
your wife is capable

34:53.526 --> 34:55.180
of doing something
like this.

34:56.703 --> 34:58.052
I know she had...

34:58.096 --> 34:59.314
some issues, but...

34:59.358 --> 35:00.924
God.

35:00.968 --> 35:03.101
Your wife set out
to ruin Diana's life.

35:03.144 --> 35:05.842
And she might succeed
if you don't stop her.

35:05.886 --> 35:07.627
Stop her how?

35:07.670 --> 35:09.498
What, you want me to get up
on the witness stand

35:09.542 --> 35:11.848
and-and tell the world
that my wife was a sociopath?

35:13.111 --> 35:14.851
I can't do that to my kids.

35:14.895 --> 35:17.158
Look, I know that
this is difficult...

35:17.202 --> 35:19.073
They just lost
their mother.

35:19.117 --> 35:21.641
I will not take her memory away
from them, too.

35:21.684 --> 35:23.947
Diana could go to
jail for 20 years.

35:23.991 --> 35:26.341
This jury is against her.

35:26.385 --> 35:28.343
No. They won't convict her.

35:29.736 --> 35:31.738
She's got a great lawyer.

35:31.781 --> 35:33.174
And she has you.

35:33.218 --> 35:34.567
I know you will do
whatever it takes

35:34.610 --> 35:36.438
to protect her.

35:37.744 --> 35:38.701
But I have
to protect

35:38.745 --> 35:40.094
my children.

35:41.530 --> 35:43.315
This is not my news to share.

35:43.358 --> 35:44.881
But before you make a decision

35:44.925 --> 35:46.231
you're gonna regret,
there's something

35:46.274 --> 35:47.275
you should know.

35:49.712 --> 35:51.105
Diana is pregnant.

35:52.498 --> 35:53.455
Pregnant?

35:53.499 --> 35:54.804
Yes.

35:55.979 --> 35:57.677
Are you sure?Frederick,

35:57.720 --> 35:59.679
how are you gonna
protect that child?

36:07.252 --> 36:10.080
I first realized that something
was wrong with my wife

36:10.124 --> 36:11.299
about ten years ago.

36:13.214 --> 36:14.824
Our family was living
in a co-op.

36:14.868 --> 36:17.087
And we had
this next-door neighbor.

36:17.131 --> 36:19.133
She was young,

36:19.177 --> 36:21.266
single, pretty.

36:21.309 --> 36:23.224
And my wife got it
into her head

36:23.268 --> 36:24.269
that this woman
had a thing for me,

36:24.312 --> 36:25.487
thought she was

36:25.531 --> 36:27.054
intentionally
working out

36:27.097 --> 36:29.448
in the building gym
the same time I was.

36:29.491 --> 36:31.798
One day, the woman came over
to borrow a drill and...

36:31.841 --> 36:33.756
Greta came home
and found her there and...

36:33.800 --> 36:35.280
totally freaked out.

36:35.323 --> 36:36.716
Next thing I know,
this woman is kicked out

36:36.759 --> 36:38.718
of the building
by the co-op board.

36:38.761 --> 36:40.067
Why was she kicked out?

36:41.199 --> 36:43.201
Someone had sent the board an ad

36:43.244 --> 36:44.637
that this woman
supposedly posted

36:44.680 --> 36:47.596
online offering sexual services
out of her apartment.

36:49.816 --> 36:51.383
[stammers]
She was a masseuse,

36:51.426 --> 36:54.560
so people were coming in and out
all the time.

36:54.603 --> 36:56.649
You don't think that
your neighbor placed that ad?

36:56.692 --> 36:58.085
I know she didn't.

36:59.086 --> 37:00.783
When I confrontedmy wife

37:00.827 --> 37:03.482
about faking it,
she didn't deny it.

37:03.525 --> 37:06.572
She just said,
"I'll do whatever I have to

37:06.615 --> 37:08.051
to protect my marriage."

37:08.095 --> 37:10.053
CHUNK:
Your testimony
from a few days ago

37:10.097 --> 37:11.446
implied that you believed

37:11.490 --> 37:14.057
that Ms. Lindsay
killed your wife.

37:14.101 --> 37:15.407
Do you still believe that?

37:17.757 --> 37:19.628
No.

37:19.672 --> 37:21.282
Based on what
I know now,

37:21.326 --> 37:24.372
I believe that Greta
went to great lengths...

37:26.113 --> 37:27.027
...to set Diana up, too.

37:28.463 --> 37:29.595
No further questions,
Your Honor.

37:35.078 --> 37:36.558
LEAVY:
Has the jury reached a verdict?

37:36.602 --> 37:38.168
We have, Your Honor.

37:38.212 --> 37:39.866
On the charge
of murder

37:39.909 --> 37:41.389
in the second degree,

37:41.433 --> 37:42.738
we, the jury,
find the defendant,

37:42.782 --> 37:44.174
Diana Lindsay,

37:44.218 --> 37:45.567
not guilty.

37:45.611 --> 37:46.873
[exhales sharply][gallery murmuring]

37:48.222 --> 37:49.832
Thank you.

37:49.876 --> 37:50.833
You were brilliant.

37:50.877 --> 37:51.878
Congratulations.

37:51.921 --> 37:53.358
Thank you.

37:56.099 --> 37:57.840
I don't know
how to thank you.

37:57.884 --> 37:59.015
Well...

37:59.059 --> 38:00.147
you don't have to.

38:07.546 --> 38:08.808
[bell tinkles]

38:12.159 --> 38:13.900
They serve crow
on that menu?

38:13.943 --> 38:14.901
[chuckles]

38:14.944 --> 38:16.424
[laughing]

38:16.468 --> 38:18.339
So I have to lose
and be the bigger man?

38:18.383 --> 38:19.645
That's fine.
That's fine.Oh, yeah.

38:19.688 --> 38:21.473
[chuckles]That's good.
Congratulations.

38:21.516 --> 38:23.692
I'll have to reevaluate
your brow creasing.

38:23.736 --> 38:26.042
I for sure thought you were
bluffing about that lead.

38:26.086 --> 38:28.349
No. Your crease reading
was spot-on.

38:28.393 --> 38:29.916
I was bluffing
the whole time.

38:29.959 --> 38:31.613
[groans]It was pure luck
that Danny and Taylor

38:31.657 --> 38:33.441
found that
weather balloon.

38:33.485 --> 38:35.400
Okay, that is
the wildest defense theory

38:35.443 --> 38:37.358
I have ever heard
in my life.

38:37.402 --> 38:39.447
But, I have to admit,
it did even make me

38:39.491 --> 38:40.622
question Diana's guilt.

38:41.884 --> 38:44.713
You had doubts
about Diana's guilt?

38:44.757 --> 38:46.367
Yeah,
at the end there, sure.

38:46.411 --> 38:48.151
Greta Page sounds
like a real piece of work,

38:48.195 --> 38:51.067
but what do you want to bet
Frederick was banging the, uh,

38:51.111 --> 38:53.200
masseuse neighbor
back in the day?

38:53.243 --> 38:55.985
Why didn't you just pull
the case from the jury?

38:56.029 --> 38:57.552
What?As a prosecutor,

38:57.596 --> 38:59.511
if you have doubts,
you have an ethical duty

38:59.554 --> 39:01.774
to dismiss the charges
before the jury

39:01.817 --> 39:03.079
goes to verdict.They already heard
the entire case.

39:03.123 --> 39:05.125
No, the jury had heard
all of the information.

39:05.168 --> 39:06.126
It was up to them
to decide.

39:06.169 --> 39:08.520
Rob, you're the government.

39:08.563 --> 39:10.957
[scoffs]You have all the power,
all the resources.

39:11.000 --> 39:12.915
You are supposed to be
the first and the last check

39:12.959 --> 39:14.395
in the system.

39:14.439 --> 39:16.702
If you were some newbie
public defender,

39:16.745 --> 39:18.007
this would be a different story.

39:18.051 --> 39:20.401
But Diana Lindsay had literally

39:20.445 --> 39:22.098
the best defense team
money can buy.

39:22.142 --> 39:24.971
And she almost went to jail
for the rest of her life

39:25.014 --> 39:26.929
for a crime she
didn't commit.But she's not going to jail.

39:26.973 --> 39:28.496
She's not going to jail
because you won, remember?

39:28.540 --> 39:30.977
This is your victory dinner.
