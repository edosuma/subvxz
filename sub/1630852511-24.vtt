And then once it sucks you in,
you thing don't want

someone else

05:41.387 --> 05:42.655

05:42.655 --> 05:44.456
Where's the co-sign?

06:05.077 --> 06:06.345

06:06.345 --> 06:07.446

06:07.446 --> 06:09.448

06:09.448 --> 06:11.650

06:13.452 --> 06:14.653

06:14.653 --> 06:16.522

everything.

06:16.522 --> 06:19.391
- Eventually we got
to the root of everything.

06:19.391 --> 06:21.193
It's the WAP.
- She was telling us

06:21.193 --> 06:23.262
about her [bleep]
just before you walked in.

06:23.262 --> 06:26.131
- And not only was three people
coming after the WAP.

06:26.131 --> 06:28.000
But when she went
over overseas,

06:28.000 --> 06:29.802
international waters, she said

06:29.802 --> 06:31.336
everybody was after the WAP
as well.

06:31.336 --> 06:32.538
- That's the reason why
Vinny's still single

06:32.538 --> 06:33.806
because he had the WAP.

06:33.806 --> 06:34.873
How long have you known her?
- 12 years.

06:34.873 --> 06:36.175
- 10, 12 years?

06:36.175 --> 06:38.610
When have you ever seen her
in sexy lingerie?

06:38.610 --> 06:40.012
- I know.
- Because Vinny's here.

06:40.012 --> 06:41.413
- They were really flirting.
I'm telling you.

06:41.413 --> 06:42.981
- I mean, he hasn't seen it
in 13 years.

06:42.981 --> 06:44.883
I'm wiser, older, better.

06:44.883 --> 06:46.885
- When you think about it,
her WAP is in every vacation.

06:46.885 --> 06:48.187
Even in Miami,
the whole period [bleep]

06:48.187 --> 06:49.221
came from her WAP.

06:49.221 --> 06:50.622
- Every single thing in life

06:50.622 --> 06:52.825
just goes right back
to the WAP.

06:52.825 --> 06:53.826
- I done lost my Chapstick.

06:53.826 --> 06:54.827
Is it in there?

06:54.827 --> 06:56.895
[laughter]

06:56.895 --> 06:58.030
- Oh, my God.

06:58.030 --> 07:00.499
Maybe that's
where the beach is.

07:00.499 --> 07:01.567
- Where's the beach?

07:01.567 --> 07:03.102
- It all got sucked up in here.

07:03.102 --> 07:04.770
- All got sucked up
in the cyclone.

07:04.770 --> 07:06.638
- No wonder why I feel a little
heavy some days, damn it.

07:06.638 --> 07:08.540
- Oh, my gosh. Anyway--
all: Hey!

07:08.540 --> 07:10.008
- What the hell?

07:10.008 --> 07:11.577
- God, I've missed you.

07:11.577 --> 07:12.811
- Are you still
in your pajamas?

07:12.811 --> 07:14.379
- Yeah, I gotta change.
- Same, okay.

07:14.379 --> 07:16.648
- We just had a two-hour
conversation about her WAP,

07:16.648 --> 07:17.649
and he can't find better.

07:17.649 --> 07:18.917
- Morning.

07:18.917 --> 07:20.252
- It's safe to say
that everything I miss

07:20.252 --> 07:21.820
on this vacation so far
has to do

07:21.820 --> 07:23.822
with Angelina's vagina,
and I'm all caught up.

07:23.822 --> 07:25.257
[laughs]

07:25.257 --> 07:29.895
I just can't believe that
it all came down to the WAP.

07:29.895 --> 07:31.130
- She had guys crying
over it, bro.

07:31.130 --> 07:32.564
- That guy housesitting?

07:32.564 --> 07:34.733
- Hi, are you in my garage?

07:34.733 --> 07:36.935
- Wait. Time out.

07:36.935 --> 07:40.305
She's FaceTiming a guy
at her house in the garage.

07:40.305 --> 07:41.807
- She got a dude staying
at the house right now.

07:41.807 --> 07:43.876
- I know.
- Give me the first letter.

07:43.876 --> 07:45.978
- V.
- V?

07:45.978 --> 07:46.979
Is it Vinny?

07:46.979 --> 07:49.882
[laughs] Stop.

07:49.882 --> 07:51.150
- His name is Vinny.
- His name is Vinny.

07:51.150 --> 07:52.284
- You got to be [bleep] me.

07:52.284 --> 07:54.219
- Of course it is.
Just admit it.

07:54.219 --> 07:55.220
Just admit it, girl.

07:55.220 --> 07:56.288
You want this D.

07:56.288 --> 07:57.322
- No, thank you.

07:58.423 --> 07:59.424
- Hey.

07:59.424 --> 08:00.859
- Hi, everyone.

08:03.495 --> 08:07.299
- All right, so I was
thinking, for today, guys,

08:07.299 --> 08:10.035
we go to a wildlife preserve.

08:10.035 --> 08:11.970
- Bunch of animals
going to see the animals.

08:11.970 --> 08:14.306
- So it's called
Lions, Tigers, and Bears.

08:14.306 --> 08:16.074
both: Oh, my.
- Stop lying.

08:16.074 --> 08:17.609
- A wildlife preserve.
- Feed the guidos.

08:17.609 --> 08:19.211
- Hey, we feed Vinny
to the lions.

08:19.211 --> 08:20.445
- I agree.

08:20.445 --> 08:22.181
I think we feed Vinny
to the lions.

08:22.181 --> 08:23.315
- Angelina's going in lingerie.

08:23.315 --> 08:24.650
- [bleep] yeah.

08:24.650 --> 08:27.119
<i>[upbeat music]</i>

08:27.119 --> 08:28.887
- Angelina, stop, bro.

08:28.887 --> 08:30.489
- We're gonna have to pack
a little bag.

08:30.489 --> 08:33.358
- Okay, you could do backpack
because I only have mini bags.

08:33.358 --> 08:34.493
- Angelina, get out of here.

08:34.493 --> 08:35.494
[bleep]...
- Your room.

08:35.494 --> 08:36.595
- You're thirsty.

08:36.595 --> 08:37.596
- [laughs]

08:37.596 --> 08:38.664
- You're thirsty for me.

08:38.664 --> 08:40.999
- You know you want it,
dumbass.

08:42.801 --> 08:43.802
Yeah?

08:43.802 --> 08:45.103
- What are we doing?

08:45.103 --> 08:47.773
- We are going to pack
a cooler with beverages.

08:47.773 --> 08:48.774
I love planning.

08:48.774 --> 08:50.075
It's like my best thing.

08:50.075 --> 08:51.977
Honestly, I would
probably be a party planner

08:51.977 --> 08:53.679
if I wasn't here.

08:53.679 --> 08:55.280
- Ew.

08:55.280 --> 08:56.381
- We have to empty this.

08:56.381 --> 08:57.516
- It looks like piss water.

08:57.516 --> 08:58.584
- Yeah, we have to empty this.

08:58.584 --> 09:00.152
- Where?
- I guess outside.

09:00.152 --> 09:01.286
- In the tub?

09:01.286 --> 09:02.688
- Of course we're
gonna bring drinks

09:02.688 --> 09:07.226
because, you know,
who doesn't like a nice wine?

09:07.226 --> 09:08.827
- Ow.

09:08.827 --> 09:11.663
- This is going to be
a friggin' blast.

09:11.663 --> 09:12.664
- Oh, [bleep]!

09:12.664 --> 09:15.000
Deena.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.870
- I didn't realize
there was glass in there.

09:17.870 --> 09:19.171
- Oh, look, there's a drain.

09:19.171 --> 09:20.172
Oh, my God.

09:20.172 --> 09:22.307
How perfect!

09:22.307 --> 09:23.442
- Look at that.

09:23.442 --> 09:24.443
- Awesome.

09:24.443 --> 09:26.078
- We did God's work today.

09:26.078 --> 09:27.212
[burps]

09:27.212 --> 09:28.647
- Oh, I smell a hot dog.

09:28.647 --> 09:30.415
- My burp?

09:30.415 --> 09:31.783
Ew.

09:31.783 --> 09:33.485
- I thought it was from
the baseball stadium.

09:33.485 --> 09:34.720
- I just burped.

09:34.720 --> 09:37.589
- Ooh, I smell a hot dog.

09:44.029 --> 09:45.464
Welcome to the meatball crew.

09:45.464 --> 09:48.700

- Happy birthday, Nikki!

09:48.700 --> 09:51.403
[all cheering]

09:51.403 --> 09:55.407
- You should put that on
your lap, like a gentlemen.

09:55.407 --> 09:56.775
- Ooh, thanks.

09:56.775 --> 09:58.343
- Who done call me?

09:58.343 --> 09:59.344
- You're calling Jionni.

09:59.344 --> 10:01.947
- [snorts] Babe.

10:01.947 --> 10:04.483
- Dren is at full force
right now...

10:04.483 --> 10:05.484
- Oh.

10:05.484 --> 10:06.852
- And she is a savage.

10:06.852 --> 10:09.054
- Give me that titty, bitch.

10:22.842 --> 10:24.310
- Ice.

10:24.310 --> 10:25.745
[screams]

10:25.745 --> 10:28.114
- So guys,
it's Nikki's birthday,

10:28.114 --> 10:30.282
and I want her to feel
like part of the family.

10:30.282 --> 10:31.851
So I made her a scrapbook.

10:31.851 --> 10:32.852
- Very cute.

10:32.852 --> 10:33.886
- You would do this.

10:33.886 --> 10:35.788
- 30 things we love about you

10:35.788 --> 10:38.891
and 30 things
you should know about Pauly.

10:38.891 --> 10:40.659
- Is this gonna cause a fight?

10:40.659 --> 10:43.396
- No, it's, like, funny stuff,
like he's loud.

10:43.396 --> 10:45.297
- Well, that's a given.

10:45.297 --> 10:46.432
- And then I figure
we could all...

10:46.432 --> 10:47.466
- Oh, my God.

10:47.466 --> 10:48.901
- Add something else into it.

10:48.901 --> 10:50.202
- I want a [bleep] scrapbook.
- Yeah, me too.

10:50.202 --> 10:51.370
- [bleep].
- Yeah, me too.

10:51.370 --> 10:52.838
Why didn't I ever get
a scrapbook?

10:52.838 --> 10:54.240
- You give Nikki a scrapbook
and not me a scrapbook?

10:54.240 --> 10:55.941
- I want one. My scrapbook--
I want my own scrapbook.

10:55.941 --> 10:57.843
- You guys are giving me
a headache.

the [bleep] scrapbook.

to get a scrapbook.

11:06.952 --> 11:09.422

to punch me.

11:15.761 --> 11:17.596

11:18.798 --> 11:19.865

in the cooler.

11:19.865 --> 11:21.367

11:21.367 --> 11:23.536
- So who's Vinny
from Staten Island?

at her house in the garage.

11:26.639 --> 11:27.873
- How's the WAP?

11:27.873 --> 11:30.276
- Don't [bleep] ask that,
Vinny, [bleep].

11:30.276 --> 11:32.678
- Is he a good lay
or is he a good person?

11:32.678 --> 11:34.113
There's a difference.
- He's actually both.

11:34.113 --> 11:35.381
- Is he hot?

11:35.381 --> 11:36.782
- He's jacked--
he's jacked as [bleep].

11:36.782 --> 11:37.883
But right now I'm just--

11:37.883 --> 11:39.585
I'm just not at that point

11:39.585 --> 11:41.921

looking at me like that?

13:40.506 --> 13:41.540
He's hungry.

13:41.540 --> 13:43.509
- Mom.
- Welcome out here.

13:43.509 --> 13:44.977
This is
Lions, Tigers, and Bears.

13:44.977 --> 13:47.446
We are an accredited
exotic animal sanctuary.

13:47.446 --> 13:50.749
Being a sanctuary, we are here
because we rescue animals

13:50.749 --> 13:54.320
from neglect,
unwanted abuse situations,

13:54.320 --> 13:57.256
people that buy animals
illegally or legally.

13:57.256 --> 13:59.558
We're gonna kind of get going
on a visit,

13:59.558 --> 14:02.294
and we'll meet a lot
of the different animals

14:02.294 --> 14:04.630
that have come from really
poor situations,

14:04.630 --> 14:06.465
and we've been able
to give them a forever home.

14:06.465 --> 14:08.334
Are you guys ready to meet
the first two tigers?

14:08.334 --> 14:09.335
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

14:09.335 --> 14:10.569
Okay.

14:10.569 --> 14:12.204
- Lions, Tigers, and Bears
Sanctuary--

14:12.204 --> 14:13.906
this place is huge.

14:13.906 --> 14:15.274
<i>This is no zoo.</i>

14:15.274 --> 14:17.109
It's an actual habitat.

14:17.109 --> 14:19.244
- Nola is the white tiger.

14:19.244 --> 14:21.213
Mocha is the orange tiger.

14:21.213 --> 14:23.916
And she is definitely the more
dominant, as you can see.

14:23.916 --> 14:26.151
She's up at the front.
He's staying in the back.

14:26.151 --> 14:29.021
He's respecting her decision...
- Oh, so she's the boss.

14:29.021 --> 14:31.323
- To be the feeder right now.
- The power of the P, right?

14:31.323 --> 14:35.160
Even in the jungle, the power
of the [bleep] conquers all.

14:35.160 --> 14:38.330
- We're gonna go in
right about mouth level to her,

14:38.330 --> 14:40.366
get the fork points through
the same piece of chain link.

14:40.366 --> 14:43.535
- Are you hungry?

14:43.535 --> 14:44.770
Go, D!

14:44.770 --> 14:46.538
[tiger growls]
- Ooh!

14:46.538 --> 14:48.674
- Whoa!

14:49.775 --> 14:51.110
- Got it.

14:51.110 --> 14:52.211
- Okay, we're gonna head down

14:52.211 --> 14:54.013
to the black bear habitat next.

14:54.013 --> 14:55.714
- She's got the cooler
in the back.

14:55.714 --> 14:57.082
- Black bears are omnivores,

14:57.082 --> 14:59.685
so they eat a diet
similar to ours.

14:59.685 --> 15:01.787
They eat a lot of fruits,
vegetables.

15:01.787 --> 15:04.990
So we're gonna head over here
to our right-hand side.

15:04.990 --> 15:06.358
- Whoa, look at that bear.

15:06.358 --> 15:07.359
They're huge.

15:07.359 --> 15:08.794
- He's [bleep] massive.

15:08.794 --> 15:10.029
- Oh, God.

15:10.029 --> 15:11.563
- I'm sweating.

15:11.563 --> 15:13.899
- Okay, if you look
to your right-hand side,

15:13.899 --> 15:17.369
somebody is having a snack,
and his name is Meatball.

15:17.369 --> 15:19.171
- [screaming]

15:19.171 --> 15:20.973
- Meatball!
- What the hell?

15:20.973 --> 15:22.808
- Look at is--
aww, he's so cute.

15:22.808 --> 15:24.043
- They're healthy bears.

15:24.043 --> 15:26.178
- He was a bear
that was a nuisance--

15:26.178 --> 15:28.147
- Meatball!
- Called a nuisance bear.

15:28.147 --> 15:29.214
- Oh, my God.
That makes sense.

15:29.214 --> 15:31.450
- It's called a nuisance bear.

15:31.450 --> 15:33.819
- [laughs]
I bet you he can drink,

15:33.819 --> 15:36.321
and he can be a good time.

15:36.321 --> 15:38.724
- He was going down the streets
in a neighborhood.

15:38.724 --> 15:39.925
He was getting in trouble.

15:39.925 --> 15:41.193
- No, no.

15:41.193 --> 15:42.761
- Come here.
- Why?

15:42.761 --> 15:45.297
- I'm taking you back inside.
- [crying] No!

15:45.297 --> 15:48.033
- So he was drunk
and acting disorderly.

15:48.033 --> 15:50.102
Yeah, he was a troublemaker.

15:50.102 --> 15:52.771
- Get the [bleep] off. Get off.

15:52.771 --> 15:55.074
The fact that the bear's
a nuisance and we are--

15:55.074 --> 15:57.509
I mean, welcome
to the meatball crew.

15:57.509 --> 15:59.445
- Party's here.

16:03.101 --> 16:04.168
<i>- ♪ Wow, wow, wow, wow ♪</i>

16:04.168 --> 16:05.670
<i>♪ Ooh, you know you bad ♪</i>

16:05.670 --> 16:06.904
<i>♪ Talk, talk, talk,
better handle that ♪</i>

16:06.904 --> 16:08.272
<i>♪ Haters get out of line ♪</i>

16:08.272 --> 16:09.440
<i>♪ Don't let us stop
your stacks ♪</i>

16:09.440 --> 16:11.142
- They love
a sweet treat sometimes.

16:11.142 --> 16:12.577
So we're gonna make
some peanut butter and jellies

16:12.577 --> 16:14.078
for them to feed.

16:14.078 --> 16:16.914
We're gonna test your
peanut butter and jelly skills.

16:16.914 --> 16:17.915
I think we should do
a relay race.

16:17.915 --> 16:19.083
- Relay race.
Yeah.

16:19.083 --> 16:20.318
- Okay, line up here
in the front.

16:20.318 --> 16:22.387
- A race.
- Are we racing?

16:22.387 --> 16:24.222
- I can't even "bear" to watch.
[chuckles]

16:24.222 --> 16:27.492
- One, two, three, go!

16:27.492 --> 16:30.528
[all shouting]

16:33.431 --> 16:35.032
<i>- Everybody is scrambling.</i>

16:35.032 --> 16:37.368
You can tell who's actually
made a peanut butter and jelly

16:37.368 --> 16:39.437
sandwich and who hasn't.

16:39.437 --> 16:40.838
- Go, baby, go!

16:40.838 --> 16:43.107
- Clearly, Nikki's made them
before--too good

16:43.107 --> 16:44.442
that she's taking her time
with it.

16:44.442 --> 16:46.010
But this is a race.
Give me that knife.

16:46.010 --> 16:47.612
I need to go a little bit
faster than that.

16:47.612 --> 16:50.615
[indistinct shouting]

16:50.615 --> 16:52.316
- Come on, Team Buckner!

16:52.316 --> 16:53.718
- Come on, Mom.

16:53.718 --> 16:55.586
Snooki, Snooki.

16:55.586 --> 16:57.288
<i>- But I'm a mom,
and I know how to make</i>

16:57.288 --> 16:58.656
these [bleep] really quick.

16:58.656 --> 17:00.525
- Snooki, Snooki.

17:00.525 --> 17:01.926
- Go bitch, go bitch!
- Whoa!

17:01.926 --> 17:03.861
Whoa! We win!

17:03.861 --> 17:07.899
[all cheering]

17:07.899 --> 17:10.368
- Boom, the sandwiches are done
in 2 seconds.

17:10.368 --> 17:12.203
And hi, we win.

17:12.203 --> 17:13.371
Thank you.

17:13.371 --> 17:15.440
- We have the winners
right here.

17:15.440 --> 17:18.309
[all cheering]

17:19.444 --> 17:21.446
- Babe, you took too long
on your sandwich, man.

17:21.446 --> 17:22.713
- Here you go.

17:22.713 --> 17:26.083
- So we are feeding
Blossom right now.

17:26.083 --> 17:28.419
- Can I go inside the cage
and everybody feed me?

17:28.419 --> 17:29.420
- [laughs]

17:29.420 --> 17:30.855
- I'm hungry.

17:30.855 --> 17:32.457
- Mike is drooling right now.

17:32.457 --> 17:33.691
He's so jealous
that the bears get to eat this

17:33.691 --> 17:34.692
but he doesn't.

17:34.692 --> 17:36.727
[laughs]

17:36.727 --> 17:40.097
- If I was a bear, y'all
could feed me fettuccine,

17:40.097 --> 17:44.802
diet sodas, funfetti cupcakes,
chicken fingers, bangers.

17:44.802 --> 17:49.006
Big Daddy Sitch would love
to be one of these bears.

17:49.006 --> 17:52.176
<i>And sit back in the cage,
get loved up on.</i>

17:52.176 --> 17:55.880
Wow, I can see it now.

17:55.880 --> 17:58.783
Big Daddy Sitch
at the Sanctuary.

18:05.423 --> 18:07.058
We got a good situation.

18:07.058 --> 18:09.994
- So guys, I do have
one more surprise.

18:09.994 --> 18:11.362
- Ooh, really?

18:11.362 --> 18:12.530
- All right, let's go.

18:12.530 --> 18:14.031
Seems like group chat

18:14.031 --> 18:16.067
is the problem
with all of the issues

18:16.067 --> 18:17.602
<i>that are happening.</i>

18:17.602 --> 18:18.769
- I'm sending it to the squad
right now

18:18.769 --> 18:20.338
because I am shooketh.

18:20.338 --> 18:22.473
- It was our group chat.
Deena started it.

18:22.473 --> 18:24.008
- It all stems
from group chat beef.

18:25.176 --> 18:26.644
[message notification]

18:26.644 --> 18:28.412
- What the hell?

18:28.412 --> 18:31.015
I'm gonna have to send this
to the squad.

18:31.015 --> 18:33.284
- So I called
Lions, Tigers, and Bears

18:33.284 --> 18:36.153
to see if they can help me
come up with a funny way

18:36.153 --> 18:37.522
to just end it.

18:37.522 --> 18:40.391
I saw that you have
beef in a box.

18:40.391 --> 18:42.760
<i>- They're called Enrichment
Boxes for the animals.</i>

18:42.760 --> 18:45.429
- If you could put "Group Chat"
on the box--

18:45.429 --> 18:46.731
- Group Chat?

18:46.731 --> 18:48.633
Oh, my God.

18:48.633 --> 18:51.369
- So guys,
the tigers are going to

18:51.369 --> 18:52.937
basically tear apart a box.

18:52.937 --> 18:54.372
I put "Group Chat" on it.

18:54.372 --> 18:56.207
Since Angelina is not in it,
we put all of our beef

18:56.207 --> 18:58.442
in this box.
- The beef? Get it?

18:58.442 --> 19:02.213
- And tigers destroy
this [bleep] beef for good,

19:02.213 --> 19:04.515
and we kumbaya and move on.
- Thank God.

19:04.515 --> 19:06.317
all: Yes!

19:06.317 --> 19:07.852
- Walking up to this
whole thing

19:07.852 --> 19:09.654
that Deena set up,
where it's group chat

19:09.654 --> 19:11.088
and there's tigers
and meat inside.

19:11.088 --> 19:14.926
I'm like, yes, [bleep],
God, thank you.

19:14.926 --> 19:16.527
[bleep] you, group chat.
I can't stand you.

19:16.527 --> 19:17.562
I hate you.

19:17.562 --> 19:19.063
- Oh, my God!

19:19.063 --> 19:20.431
Oh, it's happening.

19:20.431 --> 19:21.933
Oh, no, group chat!

19:21.933 --> 19:23.968
- Oh, my God.

19:23.968 --> 19:25.603
- Group chat, no!

19:25.603 --> 19:27.738
- Group chat is down!

19:27.738 --> 19:28.739
- I [bleep] hate group chat.

19:28.739 --> 19:29.774
I hate it.

19:31.842 --> 19:33.878
- Is that Angelina
going after group chat?

19:33.878 --> 19:35.346
- Yes, that is.

19:35.346 --> 19:39.283
- That's a Wet Ass [bleep]
destroying the group chat.

19:39.283 --> 19:42.286
- Right now, the symbolism
of the [bleep] meat

19:42.286 --> 19:44.322
and the [bleep] and the box
and all that [bleep]

19:44.322 --> 19:47.291
means that group chat is done.

19:47.291 --> 19:48.292
- Yo.

19:48.292 --> 19:50.595
It's all--all about the WAP.

19:50.595 --> 19:51.929
- Power of the [bleep]!

19:51.929 --> 19:53.564
<i>- This is awesome.</i>

19:53.564 --> 19:57.401
That's exactly what needed
to be done so we can move on

19:57.401 --> 19:59.437
and have fun on this trip.

19:59.437 --> 20:01.172
- Bro, that [bleep]'s
soaking wet.

20:01.172 --> 20:02.773
- It always is.

20:02.773 --> 20:03.941
[laughter]

20:03.941 --> 20:05.576
That's why
it's the [bleep] WAP.

20:05.576 --> 20:07.144
[low growling]

20:11.668 --> 20:13.336
<i>- ♪ And I remember summertime,

20:13.336 --> 20:14.771

you have to wait for Vinny.

20:14.771 --> 20:16.206
- Oh, [bleep] it.

20:16.206 --> 20:17.273
- All right, we're all here.

20:17.273 --> 20:18.808
- Vinny is taking a [bleep].

20:18.808 --> 20:19.809
- Of course he is.

20:19.809 --> 20:21.277
- That was so nice.

20:21.277 --> 20:23.680
- Deena, that whole entire
group chat thing--fire.

20:23.680 --> 20:24.914
- The beef was put behind us.

20:24.914 --> 20:28.485
<i>Group chat
was literally destroyed</i>

20:28.485 --> 20:29.586
by a bunch of tigers.

20:29.586 --> 20:31.020
- Oh, my God!

20:31.020 --> 20:32.622
- Group chat, no!

20:32.622 --> 20:34.324
- When we get back,
let's start getting ready.

20:34.324 --> 20:36.393
I booked
a really fancy restaurant

20:36.393 --> 20:37.627
for Nikki's birthday.

20:37.627 --> 20:39.429
We want to do something special
for Nikki

20:39.429 --> 20:40.964
because she is turning 30.

20:40.964 --> 20:42.165
<i>Super bougie.</i>

20:42.165 --> 20:44.434
<i>You know, 30 is a big one.</i>

20:44.434 --> 20:45.802
- You guys changing?

20:45.802 --> 20:48.438
- Yeah,
it's a really fancy place.

20:48.438 --> 20:49.939
- I don't want to dress up.

20:49.939 --> 20:51.408
- I don't want any trouble.

20:51.408 --> 20:52.909
So hopefully, Dren will behave.

20:52.909 --> 20:54.878
- Deena, show your tit.
- No.

- [screams, laughs]

21:07.924 --> 21:09.726
- I smell like a grizzly bear.

21:09.726 --> 21:12.095
- We just got back
from the animal sanctuary.

21:12.095 --> 21:14.731
There were some tigers
playing in the water.

21:14.731 --> 21:16.433
- Bye, babe,
we're gonna go shower.

21:16.433 --> 21:17.834
- Speaking of
wet-ass [bleep].

21:17.834 --> 21:19.035
- Let me get a shower.
- Pauly's going to shower.

21:19.035 --> 21:20.203
- Let me get a shout-out, man.

21:20.203 --> 21:21.971
- See you later.

21:21.971 --> 21:23.840
- No.

21:23.840 --> 21:24.874
- Yeah.

21:24.874 --> 21:25.909

21:28.011 --> 21:29.112

21:29.112 --> 21:30.847
I just threw up
all over my tits.

21:30.847 --> 21:32.916

21:32.916 --> 21:34.217
Nicole and I are like,
[bleep] this.

21:34.217 --> 21:35.985
We're the dirty stay-outs.
We want to drink.

21:35.985 --> 21:37.353
- Cheers.

21:37.353 --> 21:38.922
- We don't need to take forever
to get ready.

21:38.922 --> 21:40.423

to say?

37:04.955 --> 37:06.190
<i>She's been gone.</i>

37:06.190 --> 37:07.458
Like, Snooki want smush smush.

37:07.458 --> 37:10.261
- Yeah, I'm gonna go talk
to my friends.

37:12.329 --> 37:13.731
[both laughing]

37:13.731 --> 37:15.132
- Thank you.

37:15.132 --> 37:16.834
- It smells like a fish.

37:16.834 --> 37:18.202
It smells like a [bleep] fish.

37:18.202 --> 37:19.470
- They have sushi.

37:19.470 --> 37:21.939
But your salad right there
is very good.

37:21.939 --> 37:23.641
- No, it smells like a fish.

37:23.641 --> 37:25.075
- Don't call Jionni right now.

37:25.075 --> 37:26.911
- I'm not trying.
- You're trying.

37:26.911 --> 37:28.145
- I'm eating.

37:28.145 --> 37:29.880
[laughs]

37:29.880 --> 37:31.582
So put it in my mouth, bitch.

37:31.582 --> 37:33.317
- Oh, damn.
- Asparagus with bacon.

37:33.317 --> 37:34.652
Asparagus with bacon.

37:34.652 --> 37:35.986
Fire.

37:35.986 --> 37:38.055
- I'm feeding Nicole
the same way I just fed

37:38.055 --> 37:39.757
the tigers and bears
and [bleep].

37:39.757 --> 37:41.992
- She may just get
a little upset,

37:41.992 --> 37:43.794
and it causes a
scuffle that we don't

37:43.794 --> 37:45.296
really want to encourage.

37:45.296 --> 37:47.998
- Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!

37:47.998 --> 37:49.500
<i>- Oh, my God.</i>

37:49.500 --> 37:50.701
<i>What is going on?</i>

37:50.701 --> 37:52.236
This is, like,
a friggin' nightmare.

37:52.236 --> 37:53.237
Oh, my God.

37:53.237 --> 37:54.905
- Did anybody order pizza here?

37:54.905 --> 37:56.440
- Heyo!

37:56.440 --> 37:57.975
<i>- We have so much food
over here,</i>

37:57.975 --> 37:59.143
and somebody ordered a pizza.

37:59.143 --> 38:01.378
- Right here. Thank you.

38:01.378 --> 38:04.081
- Who ordered a pizza?
- Oh, my God.

38:04.081 --> 38:06.083
[laughs]
Nicole just ordered a pizza?

38:06.083 --> 38:08.085
- Bam.
- In a steakhouse?

38:08.085 --> 38:09.320
- Get it, girl.

38:09.320 --> 38:11.121
- I don't even think
BDS would do that.

38:11.121 --> 38:12.790
- Oh, damn.
- Well done.

38:12.790 --> 38:13.958
- Damn.

38:13.958 --> 38:14.992
- Thank you, Vinny.

38:16.727 --> 38:18.829
Thank you, Vinny.

38:18.829 --> 38:20.097
<i>- I don't really understand</i>

38:20.097 --> 38:21.599
<i>what Nicole is saying
right now.</i>

38:21.599 --> 38:23.200
I'm just like hoping
that she just

38:23.200 --> 38:25.869
stops talking to me,
because when you talk to Dren,

38:25.869 --> 38:28.405
you might end up in a fight
with her or something.

38:28.405 --> 38:30.407
- [screams, laughs]

38:30.407 --> 38:33.444
<i>[buzzer]</i>

38:34.712 --> 38:38.482
- When Dren is here,
it's best to stay clear.

38:41.785 --> 38:44.555
- Listen! I am...

38:44.555 --> 38:46.624
I love my life!

38:46.624 --> 38:48.425
Stop!

38:48.425 --> 38:50.728
Oh, [bleep].

38:50.728 --> 38:51.895
- Oh, my God.

38:51.895 --> 38:53.764
- She's good.

38:53.764 --> 38:55.199
- I'm offended.

38:55.199 --> 38:58.836
[bleep] me! [bleep] me!

39:03.140 --> 39:04.141
- Watch the drink.

39:04.141 --> 39:06.710
Watch the drink.
Watch the drink.

39:06.710 --> 39:09.546
Oh, [bleep].

39:12.950 --> 39:15.052
- Give me that titty, bitch.

39:15.052 --> 39:16.086
- Yeah, get her.

39:16.086 --> 39:19.189
- Give it to me!
Give it to me!

39:19.189 --> 39:21.792
- This is a birthday
that I will never forget.

39:21.792 --> 39:24.395
No, that's not your water.

39:24.395 --> 39:25.562
- Oh, my God.

39:25.562 --> 39:26.997
It's like chasing a toddler.

39:26.997 --> 39:28.932
- None of this is yours.

39:28.932 --> 39:32.236
- Stop. I live here.

39:32.236 --> 39:33.671
Whoa.

39:33.671 --> 39:35.439
All right, so...
[babbling indistinctly]

39:35.439 --> 39:37.541
- I feel like I'm
in a Coen brothers movie.

39:37.541 --> 39:40.744
- Sit down.
- I am sitting down.

39:40.744 --> 39:42.946
- Like, where am I?

39:42.946 --> 39:44.214
What is happening?

39:44.214 --> 39:47.351
But this is definitely
very entertaining.
