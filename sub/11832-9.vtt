00:01.401 --> 00:04.605
<i>Previously,</i>
<i>on</i> The Practice...
<i>Remember,</i>
<i>Miss Mayfield is charged</i>

00:04.638 --> 00:06.306
<i>with shaking to death</i>
<i>an 11-month-old child</i>

00:06.339 --> 00:08.007
<i>that was entrusted</i>
<i>to her care.</i>

00:08.041 --> 00:09.475
I think
she's innocent.

00:09.510 --> 00:11.344
I found a pattern
of denial with her.

00:11.377 --> 00:14.047
When she's pushed,
she retreats into God
and her religion.

00:14.080 --> 00:16.349
But I don't think
she was lying.

00:16.382 --> 00:19.786
The psychiatrist thinks
you could be in denial.

00:19.820 --> 00:21.855
What?

00:21.888 --> 00:23.023
He makes room
for the possibility

00:23.056 --> 00:24.224
that you don't even
have a memory of it.

00:24.257 --> 00:26.259
That's why you passed
the polygraph.

00:26.292 --> 00:27.894
You know the father
of the victim.

00:27.928 --> 00:28.962
He's in
the congregation.

00:28.995 --> 00:30.163
Do you think
he could have done this?

00:30.196 --> 00:31.431
Don't you think we'd
like it to be the father?

00:31.464 --> 00:34.434
History of abuse.
Tendency towards violence.

00:34.467 --> 00:37.470
But the doctors tell us
the death was immediate.

00:37.504 --> 00:39.773
Evelyn Mayfield was
the only one there.

00:39.806 --> 00:41.207
I'll give you manslaughter.

00:41.241 --> 00:44.945
I didn't kill him,
and I will not say
that I did do it

00:44.978 --> 00:46.913
just to get
less jail time.

00:46.947 --> 00:48.448
Then we go to trial.

00:48.481 --> 00:51.184
Boyfriend lives alone.
Brother... big house.

00:51.217 --> 00:52.285
Why not Plan-B them?

00:52.318 --> 00:53.754
It might be worth a try.

00:53.787 --> 00:54.855
Give them
a soft Plan B.

00:54.888 --> 00:56.657
Plan B-- soft. For both.

00:56.690 --> 00:58.759
Did you murder your sister
and frame George Vogelman?

00:58.792 --> 00:59.860
-What?!
-Objection!

00:59.893 --> 01:01.628
Did you follow her to the bar,
then go to the motel?

01:01.662 --> 01:02.462
That's sick!

01:02.495 --> 01:04.798
I represent Steve Robin
and his dad.

01:04.831 --> 01:05.999
BOBBY: Steve Robin?

01:06.032 --> 01:07.868
Brother of the victim
in your Vogelman trial.

01:07.901 --> 01:09.703
Eugene accused him
of being the killer.

01:09.736 --> 01:10.937
We're suing you.

01:10.971 --> 01:13.239
I can paint
a pretty disgusting
picture of you guys

01:13.273 --> 01:14.608
in front of a jury.

01:14.641 --> 01:16.376
Team Plan B.

01:16.409 --> 01:18.144
You take us to court
and I promise you
we will be screaming

01:18.178 --> 01:20.113
"he is the killer"
all over again.

01:20.146 --> 01:22.549
Okay, I've consulted
three lawyers,

01:22.583 --> 01:23.817
all three say settle.

01:23.850 --> 01:25.418
-I want to fight.
-So do I.

01:25.451 --> 01:28.388
Okay, Jimmy,
you'll first chair.

01:28.421 --> 01:29.523
What?!

01:29.556 --> 01:31.257
Look, no offense, Jimmy,
but shouldn't you
be doing it?

01:31.291 --> 01:33.660
I mean, he's good...
You're great,
but we need our--

01:33.694 --> 01:35.195

Oh.

02:02.022 --> 02:02.989
(music stops)

02:03.023 --> 02:03.990
It's Christmas.

02:04.024 --> 02:05.659
Surely
you've heard of it.

02:05.692 --> 02:07.127
Uh...

02:07.160 --> 02:09.996
Well, it's... it's the first
week of December.

02:10.030 --> 02:11.898
The people
who don't like Christmas

02:11.932 --> 02:13.967
are the people
who get behind
in their shopping.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.101
And the reason
they get behind

02:15.135 --> 02:17.437
is because
it sneaks up on them.

02:17.470 --> 02:18.939
It's not sneaking up
in this office,

02:18.972 --> 02:20.340
not under my watch.

02:20.373 --> 02:22.976
What's that on your head?

02:23.009 --> 02:25.111
Oh! It's mistletoe.

02:25.145 --> 02:27.681
My friend Elaine
invented this thingy.

02:27.714 --> 02:28.815
It's cute, huh?

02:28.849 --> 02:30.316
Yeah.

02:30.350 --> 02:33.053
It's 11:00.
Why are you here?

02:33.086 --> 02:35.656
Uh...couldn't sleep.

02:35.689 --> 02:36.523
Mayfield trial?

02:36.557 --> 02:38.391
Might as well work
if I'm awake.

02:38.424 --> 02:40.927
Ahh, you think
you have any chance?

02:40.961 --> 02:43.229
I mean, the baby
died in her hands--

02:43.263 --> 02:44.531
Why are you so convinced
she's guilty?

02:44.565 --> 02:46.466
She just gives me
the eebie-jeebies.

02:46.499 --> 02:48.001
You really think
she's innocent?

02:48.034 --> 02:49.469
Yeah.

02:49.503 --> 02:52.506
Remember, she did pass
the lie detector.

02:53.206 --> 02:55.509
Well, pleadings
are all packed.

02:55.542 --> 02:57.744
Anything else you need?
I'm about to go.

02:57.778 --> 02:59.345
I'm all set. Thanks.

02:59.379 --> 03:01.782
And thanks for, um...

03:01.815 --> 03:03.083
decorating the place.

03:03.116 --> 03:04.518
It looks great.

03:04.551 --> 03:07.888
Well, Christmas
should be Christmas.

03:07.921 --> 03:10.223
Merry Christmas.

03:15.562 --> 03:17.463
Christmas
should be Christmas,

03:17.497 --> 03:20.100
and a kiss
should be a kiss.

03:20.133 --> 03:23.136
Good mistletoe.
Night.

-How can you not move
for summary judgment?
-'Cause it won't fly,
and if we--

04:18.423 --> 04:19.993
Still, you got to try
with the stakes so high.

04:20.026 --> 04:22.663
It would be the same
as our motion to dismiss,
Eugene.

04:22.696 --> 04:24.631
The judge said this thing
would turn on the facts.

04:24.665 --> 04:26.299
Well, what about
preserving appeal?

04:26.332 --> 04:27.834
If this were gonna
turn on law,

04:27.868 --> 04:28.635
he would have kicked it.

04:28.669 --> 04:30.303
If we push
for summary judgment,

04:30.336 --> 04:31.805
it's gonna look
like foot dragging.

04:31.838 --> 04:35.041
Judge Papp holds grudges.
He lets the jury see them.

04:35.075 --> 04:36.843
We do not want
an unfriendly judge

04:36.877 --> 04:37.844
in this trial.

04:37.878 --> 04:38.845
Let's calm down.

04:38.879 --> 04:41.748
Nobody's talking
Christmas-y.

04:44.084 --> 04:45.986

every recess,

04:46.019 --> 04:47.387
I want you to go to her.
Embrace.

04:47.420 --> 04:48.922
I want the jury reminded
every chance we get

04:48.955 --> 04:50.323
that you believe in her.

04:50.356 --> 04:51.725
LLOYD: Absolutely.

04:51.758 --> 04:54.127
You doing okay?

04:54.160 --> 04:55.862
Believe it or not, I am.

04:55.896 --> 04:57.731
I'm in God's hands now--

04:57.764 --> 04:59.666
BOBBY: Evelyn.

05:01.101 --> 05:02.468
I know.

05:02.503 --> 05:05.438
All I'm saying is you're not
in God's hands on this,

05:05.471 --> 05:06.773
you're in the jury's.

05:06.807 --> 05:09.342
And I don't want you
to come across as a zealot.

05:09.375 --> 05:11.177
I get it, Bobby.

05:11.211 --> 05:12.212
Good.

05:12.245 --> 05:13.346
Okay, let's go.

05:13.379 --> 05:15.081
We got a cab waiting
downstairs. It's cold.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.020
-Good luck.
-Thanks.

05:20.053 --> 05:21.087
Bobby.

05:21.121 --> 05:22.222
I know you think Jimmy

05:22.255 --> 05:23.423
matches up best
against Silva, but--

05:23.456 --> 05:25.425
-I heard that.
-What?

05:25.458 --> 05:27.327
Whatever you were saying
behind my back.

05:27.360 --> 05:28.461
Listen,
I got to get to court.

05:28.494 --> 05:30.831
We'll talk about this later.

05:30.864 --> 05:32.566
You--you think
I can't do this, Eugene?

05:32.599 --> 05:34.234
I know
you can do it.

05:34.267 --> 05:37.904
Bobby. Bobby!
Two things.

05:37.938 --> 05:39.272
One--good luck.

05:39.305 --> 05:42.042
Two--I'm sorry
if I embarrassed you,

05:42.075 --> 05:43.076
I didn't mean to.

05:43.109 --> 05:46.613
But it was
an awesome kiss.

05:46.647 --> 05:48.782
Not that
I have any designs,

05:48.815 --> 05:50.316
but if your
lousy personal life

05:50.350 --> 05:52.185
comes from
any insecurity,

05:52.218 --> 05:53.353
you should know

05:53.386 --> 05:55.989
that 90% of women are
looking for a cute guy

05:56.022 --> 05:58.191
with a steady job
who can kiss.

05:58.224 --> 05:59.926
You're 3 for 3.

06:01.161 --> 06:03.664
Trial. Don't be late.

06:09.703 --> 06:11.037
Michael.

06:12.973 --> 06:14.240
And you.

06:14.274 --> 06:16.242
They suspended him
from school.

06:16.276 --> 06:17.243
For what?

06:17.277 --> 06:18.779
For passing a few notes.

06:18.812 --> 06:20.847
It's the most ridiculous
thing I ever heard of,

06:20.881 --> 06:22.883
and I want
to take them to court.

06:22.916 --> 06:23.684
In here.

06:23.717 --> 06:25.318
And don't you be
swattin' him.

06:25.351 --> 06:26.620
I'm not going
to swat him.

06:26.653 --> 06:28.221
You just keep
the blinds open,

06:28.254 --> 06:29.222
because I don't trust you.

06:29.255 --> 06:30.323
You didn't
have to come here.

06:30.356 --> 06:31.491
You can go to any
lawyer you please.

06:31.525 --> 06:33.259
I came here for some
civilized lawyering--

06:33.293 --> 06:35.261
...If I swat anybody...

06:35.295 --> 06:37.631
In here, Michael.

06:39.099 --> 06:41.167
You can come.

06:44.004 --> 06:45.839
Sexual harassment?

06:45.872 --> 06:49.242
Yes. A few notes
in the back of the classroom,

06:49.275 --> 06:50.544
and they bounce him.

06:50.577 --> 06:52.145
Well,
what was in these notes?

06:52.178 --> 06:53.914
Not much. Just--

06:53.947 --> 06:56.583
He's got a crush
on this girl, Kitty Nelson.

06:56.617 --> 06:58.585
You know, she finds
one of these notes,

06:58.619 --> 07:00.587
she takes it home
to her mental mother,

07:00.621 --> 07:02.388
her mother makes a complaint,

07:02.422 --> 07:03.924
and they bounce him.

07:03.957 --> 07:05.792
What was in the notes?

07:05.826 --> 07:06.993
Just stuff.

07:07.027 --> 07:08.929
What "just stuff"?

07:08.962 --> 07:13.066
You know,
"nice ass" and stuff.
Nothing bad.

07:16.369 --> 07:18.605
The autopsy was conclusive.

07:18.639 --> 07:21.241
Yes. It showed
Kevin Barlow died

07:21.274 --> 07:24.711
from injuries
consistent with
Shaken Baby Syndrome.

07:24.745 --> 07:27.614
Doctor, is it possible
that these injuries

07:27.648 --> 07:30.183
could have been
caused by an accident?

07:30.216 --> 07:32.152
No. There was
extreme hemorrhaging

07:32.185 --> 07:34.721
in the bilateral
anterior chamber,

07:34.755 --> 07:37.223
and also
retinal hemorrhaging.

07:37.257 --> 07:39.025
GAMBLE: Which means?

07:39.059 --> 07:40.426
It was not an accident.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.996
The degree of force
had to be severe.

07:43.029 --> 07:45.566
What about some other
medical condition?

07:45.599 --> 07:47.267
Well, nothing in his
prior medical records

07:47.300 --> 07:48.434
or my examination

07:48.468 --> 07:50.804
revealed any other cause
for these symptoms.

07:50.837 --> 07:54.641
Is it possible to tell
when the shaking occurred?

07:54.675 --> 07:56.877
Well, based on the acute
conditions present,

07:56.910 --> 08:00.714
Kevin's death
would have been
almost immediate.

08:02.516 --> 08:03.750
Now you found a contusion

08:03.784 --> 08:06.019
on Kevin Barlow's forehead,
didn't you?

08:06.052 --> 08:07.120
Yes, but that--

08:07.153 --> 08:08.889
Which was
about 10 days old.

08:08.922 --> 08:11.391
That injury was not
life-threatening,

08:11.424 --> 08:13.527
and was, in fact,
healing when he died.

08:13.560 --> 08:15.762
Isn't it true
that a prior head injury

08:15.796 --> 08:17.998
could begin to bleed
spontaneously in the brain?

08:18.031 --> 08:20.501
Yes, but in this case,
that wouldn't explain

08:20.534 --> 08:22.402
the extent
of the injuries.

08:22.435 --> 08:23.704
Well, isn't it also possible

08:23.737 --> 08:25.338
that something could have
happened to Kevin

08:25.371 --> 08:26.773
just prior
to being dropped off

08:26.807 --> 08:28.008
at Evelyn Mayfield's house?

08:28.041 --> 08:30.176
The likelihood of that
is so negligible that--

08:30.210 --> 08:31.978
Is it possible?

08:32.011 --> 08:34.981
I suppose anything
is possible, but, uh--

08:35.015 --> 08:36.082
Thank you, Doctor.

08:36.116 --> 08:38.217
You answered the question.

08:40.020 --> 08:41.287
How possible?

08:41.321 --> 08:42.655
Minuscule.

08:42.688 --> 08:45.291
The symptoms here
suggest

08:45.325 --> 08:46.459
an immediate death,

08:46.492 --> 08:48.294
not one that occurred
hours later.

08:48.328 --> 08:49.630
Thank you.

08:49.663 --> 08:52.533
But your findings don't
conclusively exclude

08:52.566 --> 08:53.934
the boy dying hours later.

08:53.967 --> 08:57.571
We can't positively
exclude it, no.

08:57.604 --> 08:59.706
Thank you, Doctor.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.582
We have been sitting here
over an hour, Rebecca.
You haven't
given me anything.

09:08.615 --> 09:11.652
I said that I will talk
to the principal.

09:11.685 --> 09:12.853
But I have to tell you,

09:12.886 --> 09:14.688
schools are big on sexual
harassment policies--

09:14.721 --> 09:16.657
"Big" because
all these rat lawyers

09:16.690 --> 09:18.759
got them running scared
of getting sued.

09:18.792 --> 09:21.461
It is a big
cover-your-ass disgrace.

09:21.494 --> 09:24.064
Yes, I'll stick
that argument in a footnote

09:24.097 --> 09:25.331
and not lead with it,

09:25.365 --> 09:28.134
but that does give me an idea
as to how the word "ass"

09:28.168 --> 09:29.603
slipped into his vocabulary.

09:29.636 --> 09:31.371
You be the lawyer,
all right?

09:31.404 --> 09:32.438
Not the mother.

09:32.472 --> 09:34.007
Why are you two
always fighting?

09:34.040 --> 09:35.475
I am not fighting.

09:35.509 --> 09:36.476
You watch you mouth,
all right, Michael?

09:36.510 --> 09:38.311
You talk
with some respect.

09:38.344 --> 09:39.980
Plus which,
she might hit you.

09:40.013 --> 09:41.047
Hey!

09:41.081 --> 09:42.348
One more word like that,

09:42.382 --> 09:44.184
and you can get yourself
another rat.

09:44.217 --> 09:45.886
Are we clear?

09:50.791 --> 09:52.926
We're not all
ophthalmologists, Doctor.

09:52.959 --> 09:54.995
Would you explain
retinal hemorrhaging?

09:55.028 --> 09:57.631
That's when
blood vessels
leak into the eye.

09:57.664 --> 10:00.033
But here,
there were also
retinal folds,

10:00.066 --> 10:02.703
where the retinas were
essentially folded over,

10:02.736 --> 10:04.771
almost like
contact lenses.

10:04.805 --> 10:06.039
These are
both indicators

10:06.072 --> 10:08.308
that a child has been
forcefully shaken.

10:08.341 --> 10:11.912
Now, would an individual
suffering from retinal folds

10:11.945 --> 10:15.381
be able to focus their eyes
or respond to visual cues?

10:15.415 --> 10:17.383
Absolutely not.

10:17.417 --> 10:19.319
So, then I asked
Evelyn Mayfield

10:19.352 --> 10:22.355
if the baby's eyes
were tracking
when he came to her.

10:22.388 --> 10:23.524
She said yes.

10:23.557 --> 10:24.858
Which means what?

10:24.891 --> 10:26.292
Which means
either she was lying,

10:26.326 --> 10:27.460
or she killed him.

10:27.493 --> 10:28.494
-Objection!
-Objection!

10:28.529 --> 10:30.931
-Sustained.
-You didn't believe her?

10:30.964 --> 10:32.365
If the baby
had been shaken

10:32.398 --> 10:33.634
before he came
to her house,

10:33.667 --> 10:34.635
according
to the doctors,

10:34.668 --> 10:35.836
it would
have been impossible

10:35.869 --> 10:37.738
for him to track with
his eyes like she said.

10:37.771 --> 10:40.106
If she really did
see them track,

10:40.140 --> 10:42.175
he was shaken
after he got there.

10:43.209 --> 10:44.811
Detective,

10:44.845 --> 10:46.212
when you use
the word "tracking,"

10:46.246 --> 10:47.213
what do you mean?

10:47.247 --> 10:48.181
It means whether or not

10:48.214 --> 10:50.684
someone's eyes could
follow a visual cue,

10:50.717 --> 10:52.052
-moving back and forth.
-I see.

10:52.085 --> 10:53.687
Did you explain tracking
to Evelyn Mayfield

10:53.720 --> 10:54.788
when you questioned her?

10:54.821 --> 10:56.289
Did I explain it?

10:56.322 --> 10:58.491
Yes,
did you explain the term?

10:58.525 --> 11:00.561
I don't think I did, no.

11:00.594 --> 11:01.862
In fact, you didn't know

11:01.895 --> 11:03.764
if Evelyn was even
familiar with that term

11:03.797 --> 11:05.031
at the time you
questioned her, did you?

11:05.065 --> 11:06.733
In her statement,

11:06.767 --> 11:08.401
she said the baby's eyes
were tracking.

11:08.434 --> 11:09.435
She said it.

11:09.469 --> 11:10.971
I assumed she understood
the meaning.

11:11.004 --> 11:13.373
Yes, she used
the word tracking.

11:13.406 --> 11:14.775
But that
doesn't mean she meant

11:14.808 --> 11:16.710
"responsive to visual cues."

11:16.743 --> 11:18.912
-Then what did she mean?
-We don't know, do we?

11:18.945 --> 11:20.781
Maybe just that
they were open.

11:20.814 --> 11:21.982
Move to strike.

11:22.015 --> 11:25.318
She's testifying.
She's testifying!

11:26.019 --> 11:28.254
"She's testifying!
She's testifying!"

11:28.288 --> 11:30.423
Auntie Em, come back!

11:30.456 --> 11:33.326
You sound like the
Wicked Witch of the West
when you object.

11:33.359 --> 11:36.062
Oh... you're Glinda.

11:36.096 --> 11:39.065
"Did she understand
tracking?"

11:39.099 --> 11:40.801
Oh, yeah?

11:45.371 --> 11:46.573
Aah! Stop it.

11:46.607 --> 11:47.941
No.

11:47.974 --> 11:50.443
Stop it, stop it, stop it,
stop it, stop it! Okay.

11:50.476 --> 11:51.444
Put down the can.

11:51.477 --> 11:53.346
Put down the can.
Put--put it down!

11:53.379 --> 11:54.948
Okay.

11:54.981 --> 11:57.884
You never should have
put the can down!

11:57.918 --> 11:59.419
Aah!

12:00.186 --> 12:02.956
Stop it, stop it!

12:06.192 --> 12:07.293
Hey.

12:07.327 --> 12:10.430
Bobby!
Mmm, that's good.

12:10.463 --> 12:12.265
What is going on?

12:12.298 --> 12:13.266
What?

12:13.299 --> 12:14.467
We do this every night.

12:14.500 --> 12:15.468
What are you
doing here?

12:15.502 --> 12:17.203
Well, you weren't
picking up.

12:17.237 --> 12:19.239
I need to talk to you
about something.

12:19.272 --> 12:22.242
Is it dessert?
'Cause we're ready.

12:22.275 --> 12:23.777
In my room.

12:29.349 --> 12:30.651
What's the matter?

12:30.684 --> 12:33.587
The kid's father.
He goes up tomorrow.

12:33.620 --> 12:35.021
Yeah, so?

12:35.055 --> 12:37.490
How important
do you think it is
that we go after him?

12:37.524 --> 12:39.860
Like maybe
he killed his son.

12:40.894 --> 12:44.130
How important? Hello?
That's our whole theory.

12:44.164 --> 12:46.867
Lindsay,
next week we go on trial

12:46.900 --> 12:49.035
for accusing the Robin kid
of killing his sister.

12:49.069 --> 12:51.538
Now if we Plan-B
the father tomorrow
on this case,

12:51.572 --> 12:55.075
guaranteed,
Tommy Silva will be making
a big meal out of it.

12:55.108 --> 12:57.043
Think of how it will look.

12:57.077 --> 12:58.745
We screamed that a brother
killed his sister.

12:58.779 --> 13:00.681
Now a father
killed his son?

13:00.714 --> 13:02.048
They're two
different cases.

13:02.082 --> 13:03.149
Even so...

13:03.183 --> 13:04.851
Look, we can't get out
of Evelyn's trial now.

13:04.885 --> 13:05.886
We've already started.

13:05.919 --> 13:06.920
And we can't not
go after the father.

13:06.953 --> 13:07.921
That's our defense.

13:07.954 --> 13:09.623
The only choice here

13:09.656 --> 13:11.024
is to settle
the Robin lawsuit,

13:11.057 --> 13:13.226
which is what I've been
saying all along.

13:13.259 --> 13:15.261
And beyond that...

13:15.295 --> 13:16.530
Jimmy...

13:16.563 --> 13:19.165
He's a good lawyer.

13:19.199 --> 13:22.302
But I think everybody
is having a hard time

13:22.335 --> 13:24.204
with you putting our
survival in his hands.

13:24.237 --> 13:26.773
Ellenor and Eugene
can't do it.
They're involved.

13:26.807 --> 13:28.041
Well, then get
outside counsel,

13:28.074 --> 13:29.442
or go with you and me...

13:29.475 --> 13:31.344
But not Jimmy.

13:39.986 --> 13:43.489
You know, Lindsay,
about a month or so ago,

13:43.524 --> 13:46.993
we exchanged a kiss
and we never even
talked about it.

13:47.027 --> 13:49.996
It was in the middle
of the Pearson trial.

13:52.633 --> 13:54.400
Should we talk about it?

13:56.269 --> 13:58.872
Well, why are you
bringing it up now

13:58.905 --> 14:00.774
when we're in the middle
of another trial?

14:00.807 --> 14:02.408
I don't know.
It's just...

14:03.810 --> 14:06.346
It's not something
you want to discuss?

14:06.379 --> 14:09.282
Not right now, no.

14:12.118 --> 14:13.587
Okay.

14:18.124 --> 14:20.160
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

14:20.193 --> 14:22.362
Okay.

14:37.568 --> 14:40.204
I dropped my son off at
Evelyn Mayfield's house

14:40.204 --> 14:40.914
that day on my way
to the office.

14:40.947 --> 14:42.115
That was our routine.

14:42.148 --> 14:43.784
What time
did you drop him off?

14:43.817 --> 14:46.152
It was around
8:30 in the morning.

14:46.186 --> 14:47.588
About an hour
and a half later,

14:47.621 --> 14:49.890
I got a call
from the hospital...

14:49.923 --> 14:52.626
saying that
Kevin was...

14:52.659 --> 14:56.329
that my son...
was dead.

14:56.362 --> 14:59.966
Sir, the defendant claims
your son was crying

15:00.000 --> 15:01.768
when you
delivered him to her.

15:01.802 --> 15:03.069
He was hungry.

15:03.103 --> 15:04.404
But he wasn't
upset or--

15:04.437 --> 15:05.806
Physically he was okay?

15:05.839 --> 15:07.808
He was fine.

15:07.841 --> 15:10.877
From the time you left
your house that day

15:10.911 --> 15:13.046
and arrived
at Evelyn Mayfield's,

15:13.079 --> 15:15.549
you and Kevin
were alone together.

15:15.582 --> 15:16.650
Is that correct?

15:16.683 --> 15:17.818
Yes.

15:17.851 --> 15:19.352
There were no witnesses,
no one else present

15:19.385 --> 15:21.822
during the 20 minutes
before you arrived
at Evelyn's?

15:21.855 --> 15:23.023
Witnesses to what,
me behind the wheel

15:23.056 --> 15:25.225
and Kevin in
the child seat in back?

15:25.258 --> 15:29.596
Well, when you
arrived at Evelyn's
that particular morning,

15:29.630 --> 15:32.232
Kevin was crying
uncontrollably.

15:32.265 --> 15:34.701
He was not crying
uncontrollably,
Counsel.

15:34.735 --> 15:36.102
He was just crying.

15:36.136 --> 15:37.571
Why was he crying?

15:37.604 --> 15:38.972
He was probably hungry.

15:39.005 --> 15:41.642
There was a contusion
on Kevin's forehead.

15:41.675 --> 15:42.909
You know anything
about that?

15:42.943 --> 15:44.811
He hit his head
on a coffee table.

15:44.845 --> 15:46.446
Uh-huh.

15:52.686 --> 15:54.187
You didn't hit your son,
Mr. Barlow?

15:54.220 --> 15:56.156
-GAMBLE: Objection.
-I certainly did not.

15:56.189 --> 15:57.924
-Ever beat your wife?
-Objection!

15:57.958 --> 15:59.826
Offer to show that
this man has a history

15:59.860 --> 16:02.128
-of violent behavior.
-Move to strike!

16:02.162 --> 16:03.664
The objection is overruled.

16:03.697 --> 16:05.465
Mr. Barlow, were you arrested
for domestic battery

16:05.498 --> 16:08.468
stemming from an altercation
between you and your wife?

16:08.502 --> 16:09.603
That was
a long time ago.

16:09.636 --> 16:10.704
That was a yes?

16:10.737 --> 16:11.838
Yes.

16:11.872 --> 16:12.839
You hit her?

16:12.873 --> 16:14.074
I lost my temper and--

16:14.107 --> 16:15.842
-You hit her?
-Yes!

16:15.876 --> 16:17.611
Open hand or fist?

16:20.246 --> 16:21.582
Open hand or fist, sir?

16:21.615 --> 16:22.883
It was more than
9 years ago--

16:22.916 --> 16:24.618
Open hand or fist?

16:24.651 --> 16:26.019
Fist.

16:26.052 --> 16:27.888
Ever hit your son Kevin
with an open hand or fist?

16:27.921 --> 16:28.989
Objection!
It's badgering.

16:29.022 --> 16:29.990
All right, Counsel.

16:30.023 --> 16:31.592
Did you hurt your son?

16:31.625 --> 16:33.226
Counsel! Dial it back.

16:34.194 --> 16:38.999
If it's no, Mr. Barlow,
all you have to say is no.

16:40.300 --> 16:41.602
No.

16:41.635 --> 16:45.071
I did not
hurt my son.

16:48.509 --> 16:49.442
You almost had him.

16:49.475 --> 16:50.476
I could see his face
getting red.

16:50.511 --> 16:51.945
You think I should have
gone harder?

16:51.978 --> 16:53.313
Shh.

16:54.515 --> 16:56.049
Pretty interesting
strategy in there.

16:56.082 --> 16:57.417
Plan B, right?

16:57.450 --> 16:59.385
Hey, Tommy,
what the hell do you
think you're doing?

16:59.419 --> 17:00.921
-All right.
-Sticking your nose
in a criminal trial

17:00.954 --> 17:02.222
for the purpose
of a civil case?

17:02.255 --> 17:03.790
Maybe I should
report you to the bar.

17:03.824 --> 17:04.790
I'm just
in there watching.

17:04.825 --> 17:05.791
Right now
you're talking!

17:05.826 --> 17:06.792
All right!

17:06.827 --> 17:07.794
What's this,
your only case?

17:07.828 --> 17:08.795
No, my biggest.

17:08.829 --> 17:11.431
Come on. Come on!

17:13.834 --> 17:15.435
The principal
was understanding,

17:15.468 --> 17:17.103
but he said
it's school policy.

17:17.137 --> 17:18.438
So, we can march
into court,

17:18.471 --> 17:19.640
if that's what
you want to do.

17:19.673 --> 17:20.641
-I do.
-Okay.

17:20.674 --> 17:23.276
When? Because he is
missing school now.

17:23.309 --> 17:25.779
It's already scheduled.
We go tomorrow.

17:25.811 --> 17:27.748
We'll meet here at 9:00,
then go.

17:27.781 --> 17:28.749
All right.

17:28.782 --> 17:29.916
Just so we're clear,

17:29.950 --> 17:32.018
you don't talk.

17:32.052 --> 17:33.920
What if the judge
asks me something?

17:33.954 --> 17:36.289
I will try to prevent
that from happening,
trust me.

17:36.322 --> 17:38.559
Don't be gettin' snide
with me.

17:39.526 --> 17:40.694
Hey, how'd you do?

17:40.727 --> 17:42.228
Ah, he stayed
under control.

17:42.262 --> 17:43.296
Helen probably
sat on him.

17:43.329 --> 17:45.131
And Silva was there
taking notes.

17:45.165 --> 17:46.833
Oh, I got a meeting
with him tomorrow.

17:46.867 --> 17:48.434
Silva?

17:48.468 --> 17:50.236
See if I can find
his squeal point.

17:50.270 --> 17:52.573
We know each other
some, so...

17:54.474 --> 17:56.142
Good.

17:56.577 --> 17:58.712
Lucy, in my office?

18:02.616 --> 18:04.317
(door opens)

18:06.419 --> 18:09.455
Listen, um,
be it the Christmas spirit,

18:09.489 --> 18:12.325
or... you just trying to
bolster my self-confidence,

18:12.358 --> 18:13.960
I don't think
that we should--

18:13.994 --> 18:15.328
Be kissing? I know.

18:15.361 --> 18:18.131
I didn't plan to.
Something just...
came over me.

18:18.164 --> 18:20.000
What came over you?

18:20.033 --> 18:21.467
I'm sorry?

18:21.502 --> 18:24.204
Well, Bobby,
maybe your tongue
didn't hold its own,

18:24.237 --> 18:26.707
but it didn't exactly
recoil, either.

18:26.740 --> 18:28.008
You like buttons?

18:28.041 --> 18:29.475
What?

18:29.510 --> 18:30.677
I'm the cute-as-a-button type.

18:30.711 --> 18:33.814
Some guys go for it.
Figured you for models.

18:33.847 --> 18:35.415
Anyways, you're in trial.

18:35.448 --> 18:37.350
These are not issues
you should be talking about

18:37.383 --> 18:39.252
as Miss Shake 'N Bake
is about to be cooked.

18:39.285 --> 18:41.522
You're due back in 20,
by the way.

18:52.065 --> 18:54.601
That bruise
on his forehead
was an accident.

18:54.635 --> 18:55.435
What happened?

18:55.468 --> 18:57.437
I just turned my back
for a minute,

18:57.470 --> 18:59.673
and he bumped his head
on the coffee table.

18:59.706 --> 19:01.441
Mrs. Barlow,

19:01.474 --> 19:03.877
did your son have
any other injuries

19:03.910 --> 19:06.680
or medical problems
of any kind?

19:06.713 --> 19:08.682
No.

19:09.616 --> 19:12.085
My client had been
caring for Kevin

19:12.118 --> 19:14.354
for over 3 months.
Is that right?

19:14.387 --> 19:16.990
Yes. My husband and I
both worked days,

19:17.023 --> 19:19.192
so she watched him
Monday through Friday.

19:19.225 --> 19:21.327
And over the course
of the 3 months

19:21.361 --> 19:23.263
that Evelyn Mayfield
was watching Kevin,

19:23.296 --> 19:25.532
he always seemed
well cared for?

19:25.566 --> 19:27.233
Yes.

19:27.267 --> 19:29.369
In fact, you described her
to your friends

19:29.402 --> 19:32.038
as a great caretaker,
didn't you?

19:32.072 --> 19:34.307
I've changed my position
on that, Mr. Donnell.

19:34.340 --> 19:37.177
Mrs. Barlow,
honest answer--

19:37.210 --> 19:38.645
you don't know
what happened

19:38.679 --> 19:41.014
once Kevin left your house
that morning, do you?

19:41.047 --> 19:43.584
If you're suggesting
that my husband
could've been involved,

19:43.617 --> 19:45.519
I absolutely
know you're wrong.

19:45.552 --> 19:46.787
Because you
have his word.

19:46.820 --> 19:48.622
And because I know him.

19:52.325 --> 19:55.095
Were you injured
when he struck you?

19:55.128 --> 19:56.797
-Objection.
-Overruled.

19:56.830 --> 19:58.298
Did he hurt you?

19:58.331 --> 19:59.833
That was
a long time ago.

19:59.866 --> 20:02.869
The question was
when you went to
the police station

20:02.903 --> 20:06.239
and filed a complaint
for domestic battery,

20:06.272 --> 20:08.374
had you been injured?

20:08.408 --> 20:10.777
I had a small cut or so.
It wasn't that bad.

20:17.183 --> 20:20.253
I'll show you
these photographs,

20:20.286 --> 20:23.724
marked defense exhibits
1 through 3

20:23.757 --> 20:26.259
for identification.

20:43.209 --> 20:46.613
Do you recognize
what they depict?

20:51.852 --> 20:53.720
That's me.

20:53.754 --> 20:55.922
With a small cut?

21:00.426 --> 21:02.462
Lindsay spends the morning
with character witnesses,

21:02.495 --> 21:03.764
people from
the church mostly,

21:03.797 --> 21:05.899
parents of kids
you've taken care of.

21:05.932 --> 21:08.569
I don't expect them
to be cross-examined.

21:08.602 --> 21:10.871
After lunch,
it'll be you.

21:10.904 --> 21:12.038
Okay.

21:16.910 --> 21:17.911
You ready?

21:17.944 --> 21:20.547
I just tell the truth.

21:20.581 --> 21:23.784
Well, it's not gonna be
that simple, Evelyn.

21:23.817 --> 21:26.820
Helen Gamble is good.

21:28.088 --> 21:30.290
And...she can be
pretty vicious.

21:30.323 --> 21:34.127
She can, Lindsay--
let's admit it.

21:34.160 --> 21:35.161
Now...

21:35.195 --> 21:36.396
The big one.

21:36.429 --> 21:37.964
Those 40 minutes--

21:37.998 --> 21:39.733
you said
you called 911

21:39.766 --> 21:42.468
about 20 minutes
after the baby
was dropped off.

21:42.503 --> 21:45.872
But the call
didn't come in
till after 10:00.

21:45.906 --> 21:47.073
That's the hole.

21:47.107 --> 21:49.442
Have you given that
anymore thought?

21:49.475 --> 21:52.546
All I can say
is what I remember.

21:52.579 --> 21:54.915
Maybe I got
the time wrong.

21:54.948 --> 21:56.382
I believe you.

21:56.416 --> 21:58.685
But it may not
sound believable.

21:58.719 --> 22:00.020
What should I do?

22:00.053 --> 22:01.555
Should I make
something up?

22:03.857 --> 22:04.758
No.

22:04.791 --> 22:08.194
Well, what, they're gonna
convict me of murder

22:08.228 --> 22:10.330
because I lost
track of time?

22:10.363 --> 22:12.298
Yes, it could
come down to that.

22:12.332 --> 22:14.434
Look, an 11-month-old
boy was killed.

22:14.467 --> 22:16.102
The jury is gonna hold
somebody accountable.

22:16.136 --> 22:17.504
But it wasn't me.

22:17.538 --> 22:19.906
You were the last one
with him.

22:19.940 --> 22:24.044
Be prepared to be hit
on those 40 minutes.

22:27.914 --> 22:29.983
You know, far be it for me
to suggest this

22:30.016 --> 22:31.184
since you all hammered me
the last time, but...

22:31.217 --> 22:32.886
But what?

22:32.919 --> 22:35.656
This is a déjà vu
to the Vogelman trial--

22:35.689 --> 22:38.191
last seen with the victim,
it has to be her?

22:38.224 --> 22:39.693
So?

22:39.726 --> 22:42.095
So you've got the same
public pressure
on the D. A.'s Office.

22:42.128 --> 22:43.564
They need to get
this conviction.

22:43.597 --> 22:45.566
Evelyn Mayfield
is the only one

22:45.599 --> 22:46.900
they could possibly
get it against,

22:46.933 --> 22:48.502
so she's the one
that they're going after.

22:48.535 --> 22:52.238
As much as you hated me
for torpedoing Helen...

22:52.272 --> 22:53.674
You could do it again.

22:53.707 --> 22:54.474
What?

22:54.508 --> 22:56.109
Call her as a witness.

22:56.142 --> 22:57.644
Get the same testimony.

22:57.678 --> 23:00.013
Sometimes the choice
of who they go after

23:00.046 --> 23:02.048
is linked to who they
think they can convict.

23:02.082 --> 23:04.150
I know. It's ass-backwards.

23:04.184 --> 23:05.919
We can't call Helen
as a witness.

23:05.952 --> 23:07.554
First it would be
a mistrial. Second--

23:07.588 --> 23:08.388
So?

23:08.421 --> 23:11.391
Would a mistrial
really be that bad?

23:11.424 --> 23:13.059
Where are you?

23:13.093 --> 23:14.227
BOBBY: I don't know.

23:14.260 --> 23:16.730
But we're not
calling Helen.

23:16.763 --> 23:18.331
Well...

23:18.364 --> 23:21.768
It's another card
you can play.

23:21.802 --> 23:23.403
Good night.

23:29.075 --> 23:31.411
Where do you think
we are?

23:31.444 --> 23:33.547
Well...

23:33.580 --> 23:35.816
I think she's
innocent, Bobby.

23:35.849 --> 23:37.551
But the truth is,

23:37.584 --> 23:39.352
I don't know it.

23:39.385 --> 23:41.021
If the jury's
where I am,

23:41.054 --> 23:43.524
we have
reasonable doubt.

23:57.971 --> 24:00.440
It's a note.
Passing a note
in the back of a classroom.

24:00.473 --> 24:03.176
A note containing
a sexual description that--

24:03.209 --> 24:05.245
"She's got a nice ass."

24:05.278 --> 24:06.880
It's sexual
objectification.

24:06.913 --> 24:07.748
REBECCA: Come on!

24:07.781 --> 24:09.349
And as silly as it may seem,

24:09.382 --> 24:11.051
the policy at Brockton
is no different

24:11.084 --> 24:13.854
from every other school
across this country.

24:13.887 --> 24:15.321
That only makes it
more ridiculous.

24:15.355 --> 24:17.390
He's 10 years old.

24:17.423 --> 24:19.059
Kids write
on bathroom walls,

24:19.092 --> 24:20.226
kids pass notes.

24:20.260 --> 24:21.494
And what if he should do
more than that?

24:21.528 --> 24:23.363
What if he commits
a sexual assault?

24:23.396 --> 24:26.232
Well, then you suspend him,
but for a note, you don't--

24:26.266 --> 24:27.233
The point is,

24:27.267 --> 24:28.869
the school has
notice of the note

24:28.902 --> 24:31.738
and therefore
could be held liable
if his behavior escalates--

24:31.772 --> 24:32.939
I knew it.

24:32.973 --> 24:34.875
This is just some
cover-your-ass lawyer--

24:34.908 --> 24:36.476
Ms. Baylor!

24:38.745 --> 24:41.715
Your Honor, we are
getting carried away here.

24:41.748 --> 24:43.617
Now, are you saying
that your client

24:43.650 --> 24:45.619
is being treated unfairly
under the policy,

24:45.652 --> 24:49.723
or that the policy itself
is unfair?

24:49.756 --> 24:52.092
I am saying
if we are at the point

24:52.125 --> 24:55.161
where girls and boys
can't talk to each other
at school,

24:55.195 --> 24:58.899
if they can
get suspended
for passing notes,

24:58.932 --> 25:01.835
what is going on?

25:04.104 --> 25:06.640
They don't want to
settle for nothing,

25:06.673 --> 25:09.643
but I tried to sell four.

25:09.676 --> 25:11.745
400's not going
to do it, Jimmy.

25:11.778 --> 25:15.649
Tommy, even if you win,
you're looking at
automatic appeal.

25:15.682 --> 25:17.651
This case is threshold.

25:17.684 --> 25:20.086
Suppose the jury
gives you a million?

25:20.120 --> 25:23.489
End of the day,
present day value of four
turns out to be more.

25:23.524 --> 25:25.291
Mmm, I understand.

25:25.325 --> 25:27.027
Off the record?

25:27.060 --> 25:28.228
'Course.

25:28.261 --> 25:30.030
My client's wealthy.

25:30.063 --> 25:31.497
He's dying of cancer.

25:31.532 --> 25:32.833
It's not about money.

25:32.866 --> 25:34.968
He wants you guys
out of business.

25:35.001 --> 25:37.470
At first, I thought
he'd take a million.

25:37.504 --> 25:41.241
I mean, clients come in mad,
then they settle down.
You know how it is.

25:41.274 --> 25:43.043
But he ain't settling down.

25:43.076 --> 25:45.078
He wants you guys
selling your furniture.

25:45.111 --> 25:47.514
Client comes to me with
that kind of revenge
on his mind,

25:47.548 --> 25:49.516
I tell him go
get another lawyer.

25:49.550 --> 25:51.151
Ah, come on, Jimmy.

25:51.184 --> 25:53.219
Look what they
did to this kid.

25:53.253 --> 25:55.421
You wouldn't
take this case?

25:55.455 --> 25:57.223
(chuckles)

26:02.896 --> 26:05.532
I just had a sense that
something wasn't right.

26:05.566 --> 26:07.568
Kevin usually
didn't cry like that.

26:07.601 --> 26:08.935
How long did he cry for?

26:08.969 --> 26:11.738
Maybe 10 or 20 minutes
or so,

26:11.772 --> 26:13.940
and then he
finally stopped.

26:13.974 --> 26:16.476
So I put him down
for his nap.

26:16.510 --> 26:18.845
And when did
you realize that--

26:18.879 --> 26:20.446
that something was wrong?

26:20.480 --> 26:24.417
I checked on him
about 15 minutes later,

26:24.450 --> 26:27.453
and he wasn't breathing.

26:27.487 --> 26:28.755
What'd you do?

26:28.789 --> 26:30.290
I tried to give him CPR,

26:30.323 --> 26:33.126
but it--it
just wasn't working.
He wouldn't breathe.

26:33.159 --> 26:37.998
So I--I called 911,
and finally,
the ambulance came.

26:38.031 --> 26:41.602
Now, Evelyn,
the baby arrives at 8:30,

26:41.635 --> 26:45.071
20 minutes of crying,
15-minute nap.

26:45.105 --> 26:48.675
You called 911 at 10:07.

26:48.709 --> 26:52.312
That leaves 40 minutes
unaccounted for.

26:52.345 --> 26:55.048
Maybe he cried longer,
maybe he napped longer,

26:55.081 --> 26:58.418
or--or got there later.
I honestly don't know.

26:58.451 --> 27:02.989
I-I'm not sure
how long I did CPR
before I called.

27:03.023 --> 27:06.793
And also, I--I
was in shock, maybe.

27:06.827 --> 27:09.996
I--I--I guess the time
frames could be off,

27:10.030 --> 27:12.666
but I never
harmed that child.

27:12.699 --> 27:15.368
And the idea
that I could have...

27:19.573 --> 27:21.141
Forty minutes.

27:21.174 --> 27:23.577
That's kind of a lot
to be off by.

27:23.610 --> 27:25.546
I've done my best
to explain it.

27:25.579 --> 27:27.347
You were in some shock.

27:28.248 --> 27:31.518
Is it possible you maybe
blocked out some time
in your mind?

27:31.552 --> 27:32.853
I'm sorry?

27:32.886 --> 27:34.688
Something happened which you
blocked out of your mind?

27:34.721 --> 27:36.757
I don't think
that's the case.

27:36.790 --> 27:38.625
Oh, such
a traumatic event.

27:38.659 --> 27:43.263
Certainly it's the first
time you've ever discovered
an unconscious baby, isn't it?

27:43.296 --> 27:46.066
No.

27:47.333 --> 27:48.702
There was another one?

27:48.735 --> 27:49.836
A few years back,

27:49.870 --> 27:52.906
and I saved that baby
performing CPR.

27:52.939 --> 27:54.007
You did.

27:54.040 --> 27:56.510
So you have experience
with reacting to crises?

27:56.543 --> 27:57.678
Yes.

27:57.711 --> 27:59.312
So seeing a baby
not breathing,

27:59.345 --> 28:02.182
that wouldn't be so
horrific to cause you
to block out time?

28:02.215 --> 28:03.349
That's right.

28:03.383 --> 28:04.651
What if you
killed that baby?

28:04.685 --> 28:05.952
-Objection!
-Overruled!

28:05.986 --> 28:08.321
You don't have any experience
doing that, do you?

28:08.354 --> 28:11.725
No, I do not,
Miss Gamble.

28:11.758 --> 28:12.859
Think you might
block that out?

28:12.893 --> 28:15.829
I did not
harm that baby.

28:17.163 --> 28:20.734
You know, something else
struck me as funny.

28:20.767 --> 28:22.969
You never called
Mr. and Mrs. Barlow

28:23.003 --> 28:25.371
to tell them what
happened, did you?

28:25.405 --> 28:26.507
The police called them.

28:26.540 --> 28:27.508
Yes, much later.

28:27.541 --> 28:29.109
But why didn't you?

28:29.142 --> 28:31.377
You're baby-sitting
their child,

28:31.411 --> 28:32.713
he dies...

28:32.746 --> 28:33.914
you don't call?

28:33.947 --> 28:36.449
Everything was--
was happening so fast.

28:36.482 --> 28:38.985
I--I was
going to call them.

28:39.019 --> 28:41.588
The first thing
was trying to save him.

28:41.622 --> 28:45.025
Yes, but why didn't
you call them after
you called the ambulance

28:45.058 --> 28:47.628
to let these people
know what had happened?

28:47.661 --> 28:49.896
I was holding Kevin.

28:49.930 --> 28:51.898
Or after they
took Kevin away?

28:51.932 --> 28:54.835
Was there another reason
why you didn't call?

28:57.103 --> 29:00.006
Is it possible that
the reason you didn't call

29:00.040 --> 29:02.442
was because you couldn't
bear to face them

29:02.475 --> 29:06.379
because your conscience
knew the truth
about what you did?

29:06.412 --> 29:10.150
No, that
is not possible.

29:14.087 --> 29:15.421
Manslaughter's
still good.

29:15.455 --> 29:17.791
You just gave us
grounds for appeal--
prior bad acts.

29:17.824 --> 29:20.060
That wasn't a bad act.
She saved that other child.

29:20.093 --> 29:21.762
-Plus, she opened the door.
-She did not.

29:21.795 --> 29:24.064
Just take manslaughter.
She didn't hit
any home run in there.

29:24.097 --> 29:25.532
She's not gonna
take manslaughter.

29:25.566 --> 29:27.100
She will if
you tell her to.

29:27.133 --> 29:29.069
I won't tell her to,
and I don't think that
you made the elements.

29:29.102 --> 29:32.038
Look, this could
go either way.
We all know that.

29:32.072 --> 29:33.840
Why do you
want to risk life?

29:33.874 --> 29:35.275
Manslaughter,
she's out in 5.

29:35.308 --> 29:38.945
You want to stay up all night
working on a closing argument?

29:38.979 --> 29:40.614
You guys
ever get tired?

29:40.647 --> 29:42.315
Excuse me a second.

29:43.483 --> 29:46.119
Hey, Bobby,
I'm just watching.
It's legal.

29:46.152 --> 29:47.353
Yeah, yeah.

29:47.387 --> 29:49.556
How much of her
testimony did you hear?

29:49.590 --> 29:51.958
Most, I think.

29:51.992 --> 29:53.527
Do you believe her?

29:53.560 --> 29:54.795
I don't know,

29:54.828 --> 29:56.530
but I don't
disbelieve her.

29:58.131 --> 29:59.566
They're offering
manslaughter.

29:59.600 --> 30:01.134
Ha. I wouldn't.

30:01.167 --> 30:02.536
Really?

30:02.569 --> 30:06.072
I don't think they've
made their case,
not on murder.

30:09.576 --> 30:11.077
Pretty soon,
it'll be illegal

30:11.111 --> 30:13.246
for a boy to
give a girl a flower.

30:13.279 --> 30:15.716
I share
the petitioner's concern.

30:15.749 --> 30:17.518
I also share the notion

30:17.551 --> 30:21.622
that a school is a child's
first introduction
to society.

30:21.655 --> 30:25.091
It should be no less
sexually charged just
because they're children.

30:25.125 --> 30:27.360
In fact, because
they're children,

30:27.393 --> 30:30.731
maybe these school policies
are our best hope

30:30.764 --> 30:34.901
of one day curtailing
gender hostility
and discrimination.

30:34.935 --> 30:39.305
We're quick to say education
beats retribution.

30:39.339 --> 30:42.743
So let the schools
try to educate.

30:42.776 --> 30:45.011
I'm upholding
the suspension.

30:45.045 --> 30:47.047
Oh, you gotta
be kidding me!

30:47.080 --> 30:47.881
Roberta.

30:47.914 --> 30:49.750
The world has
gone upside down.

30:49.783 --> 30:50.884
I agree.

30:50.917 --> 30:53.119
But since passing a note
as an adult

30:53.153 --> 30:55.989
could cost him
a lot of money
and even his job,

30:56.022 --> 30:58.559
maybe it's best to give
him the message now.

30:58.592 --> 31:02.262
And maybe
it's time to change
a stupid, ridiculous,

31:02.295 --> 31:06.299
God-awful,
laugh-out-loud,
dumb law.

31:07.100 --> 31:09.402
There's always that.

31:09.870 --> 31:12.973
The key is Dr. Katten.
He testified "possible"--
death wasn't immediate.

31:13.006 --> 31:15.108
-Remote. The likelihood--
-He said "possible."

31:15.141 --> 31:16.943
You just keep hammering
possible, possible, possible,

31:16.977 --> 31:18.679
doubt, doubt, doubt,
doubt.

31:18.712 --> 31:19.913
I'm leaving.

31:19.946 --> 31:22.583
If my father knew
the hours I kept here...

31:25.619 --> 31:27.353
Lucy,
what does your father do?

31:27.387 --> 31:30.557
He drives a cab.
Why?

31:30.591 --> 31:32.192
Nothing.

31:32.225 --> 31:35.395
And, um, what about
your mother?

31:35.428 --> 31:36.797
She's dead.

31:36.830 --> 31:39.533
Oh, I didn't mean to...

31:39.566 --> 31:41.201
I've heard you say
"parents."

31:41.234 --> 31:45.105
Yeah, well, sometimes
I include step-thing.

31:47.207 --> 31:49.375
Why are you looking
at me funny?

31:49.409 --> 31:52.646
I'm not, um... um...

31:52.679 --> 31:54.948
Good night.

32:01.588 --> 32:03.757
What are you doing?

32:03.790 --> 32:05.458
We have to stay on
reasonable doubt, Bobby.

32:05.491 --> 32:07.661
We can't just try to
argue the father did it.

32:07.694 --> 32:08.962
I know.

32:08.995 --> 32:11.131
Can I ask you something?

32:12.766 --> 32:14.100
Are we a couple?

32:15.101 --> 32:17.203
I mean,
a couple-in-waiting?

32:17.237 --> 32:19.873
We've kissed.
We've--what are we doing?

32:19.906 --> 32:22.275
Or not doing?

32:24.244 --> 32:25.812
What's going on?
Are you dying?

32:25.846 --> 32:27.147
Why is this
suddenly coming up?

32:27.180 --> 32:29.683
Well, isn't it strange
that we don't address--

32:29.716 --> 32:31.417
obviously we have feelings.

32:31.451 --> 32:34.487
You're asking me if it's
strange that you don't
address your feelings?

32:34.521 --> 32:35.889
Was I just insulted?

32:35.922 --> 32:39.425
Bobby, I was in love
with you once.

32:39.459 --> 32:41.461
Maybe I still am,
but I don't think--

32:41.494 --> 32:42.495
What?

32:42.529 --> 32:44.631
Do you really want
to get into this?

32:44.665 --> 32:46.600
No.

32:51.004 --> 32:52.438
(sighs)

32:52.472 --> 32:53.740
This isn't a great life.

32:53.774 --> 32:56.810
Great job, but life?

32:56.843 --> 32:59.980
You know, I need
somebody to pull me
out of this a little.

33:00.013 --> 33:02.716
And whatever you may be,

33:02.749 --> 33:05.418
you'll never be that.

33:05.451 --> 33:09.189
So we're not
a couple-in-waiting?

33:09.222 --> 33:11.424
Truth?

33:14.928 --> 33:18.732
I could fall in love
with you all over again
if I let myself...

33:21.935 --> 33:24.204
But I won't.

33:39.587 --> 33:41.044
Their own
medical expert told you

33:41.044 --> 33:44.157
that it was possible
the injury could have occurred

33:44.157 --> 33:48.962
before Kevin Barlow arrived
at Evelyn's house that day.

33:48.995 --> 33:50.797
He told you that.

33:50.831 --> 33:52.933
"Possible."

33:52.966 --> 33:55.802
Kevin's father
was alone with him.

33:55.836 --> 33:58.104
Did he shake him?

33:58.138 --> 34:00.106
We certainly have
no evidence that he did,

34:00.140 --> 34:02.008
no witnesses.

34:02.042 --> 34:05.478
But they have no proof
that he didn't,

34:05.512 --> 34:07.413
do they?

34:07.447 --> 34:11.217
And he does have
a history of violence.

34:11.251 --> 34:13.219
Evelyn Mayfield doesn't.

34:13.253 --> 34:15.688
You heard witness
after witness after witness

34:15.722 --> 34:18.891
tell you they've never
seen a hint of violence
in this woman,

34:18.925 --> 34:20.694
or even anger
for that matter.

34:20.726 --> 34:24.797
Their whole case is that
she was with the baby
at the time of death.

34:24.831 --> 34:28.434
While their own doctor says
the injury could have
preceded the boy

34:28.467 --> 34:31.538
coming into
my client's custody.

34:33.507 --> 34:35.408
Reasonable doubt?

34:38.879 --> 34:40.981
The doctor's testimony

34:41.014 --> 34:43.083
was that it was
a virtual certainty

34:43.116 --> 34:45.652
that the baby's death
was immediate.

34:45.686 --> 34:48.922
Oh, sure, they seize upon
that word "possible."

34:48.955 --> 34:52.793
It's a great word
because it's so difficult
to disprove a negative.

34:52.826 --> 34:54.427
Possible.

34:54.460 --> 34:56.262
Well, anything's
possible, I guess.

34:56.295 --> 34:58.464
But that doctor told you

34:58.498 --> 35:00.634
that the baby's death
was immediate,

35:00.667 --> 35:04.738
and the defense has done
nothing to contradict it.

35:05.606 --> 35:08.642
Maybe Evelyn Mayfield
really does believe

35:08.675 --> 35:10.243
she didn't do this.

35:10.276 --> 35:12.278
Sometimes psychic anguish

35:12.312 --> 35:14.681
can just block out
all memory.

35:14.715 --> 35:17.250
It's been
known to happen.

35:17.283 --> 35:19.553
But she did do it.

35:19.586 --> 35:21.755
And deep down,

35:21.788 --> 35:23.289
she knows she did it.

35:23.323 --> 35:26.426
That's why she
didn't call the parents,

35:26.459 --> 35:29.029
that's why
she froze on the stand.

35:29.062 --> 35:31.932
And when all these
people from her church
march up there and say,

35:31.965 --> 35:34.034
"Oh, she couldn't have.

35:34.067 --> 35:35.736
She couldn't have."

35:35.769 --> 35:39.305
Well, it probably makes it
easier for her to think

35:39.339 --> 35:41.441
she couldn't have.

35:41.474 --> 35:46.112
The death was immediate.
She was the only one there.

35:46.146 --> 35:48.749
She cannot account
for 40 minutes,

35:48.782 --> 35:50.551
40 minutes of blank time

35:50.584 --> 35:52.753
which coincides
with the time of death.

35:52.786 --> 35:55.789
Of course she did it.

36:00.060 --> 36:01.427
Roberta.

36:01.461 --> 36:04.330
I couldn't
sleep all night.
I want to appeal.

36:04.364 --> 36:05.899
We can't appeal.
Even if we could--

36:05.932 --> 36:07.167
He's a good kid.

36:07.200 --> 36:09.536
Well, nobody's
saying he isn't.

36:09.570 --> 36:11.371
Are you okay?

36:11.404 --> 36:14.007
What chance has he got?

36:14.040 --> 36:15.909
You know, I try to
get him to stop stealing,

36:15.942 --> 36:18.512
and the best way to do that
is to keep him in school,

36:18.545 --> 36:20.113
but the school
throws him out.

36:20.146 --> 36:22.115
And the courts
won't help me.

36:22.148 --> 36:24.350
I'm all by myself.

36:24.384 --> 36:27.353
His dad only comes
to see him on weekends,
and I try--

36:27.387 --> 36:29.089
REBECCA: Hey, hey.

36:29.122 --> 36:33.627
Nobody is
blaming you here.

36:34.961 --> 36:37.363
He's getting away from me.

36:37.397 --> 36:40.033
You know, the last couple
of years, he is a good kid,

36:40.066 --> 36:42.468
and now he's
out stealing bikes.

36:44.337 --> 36:46.707
He needs something
I can't give,

36:46.740 --> 36:50.677
and I don't know
what to do about that.

36:56.049 --> 36:57.718
Okay.

36:57.751 --> 36:59.219
Shh.

37:06.627 --> 37:07.861
What's up?

37:07.894 --> 37:11.331
Listen, everyone's
nervous about you doing
the Robin trial.

37:11.364 --> 37:13.266
Me, I think
you can do it.

37:13.299 --> 37:15.268
We have a partners
meeting later.

37:15.301 --> 37:16.570
A partners meeting?

37:16.603 --> 37:18.204
Our first one.

37:18.238 --> 37:20.373
In honor of me?

37:20.406 --> 37:22.576
I expect to
get voted down.

37:22.609 --> 37:26.179
But tell me how you
plan to try it.

37:26.212 --> 37:27.648
Does it matter?

37:27.681 --> 37:28.849
It might.

37:30.617 --> 37:32.586
Tommy Silva's
gonna get up there

37:32.619 --> 37:34.888
and try to separate
himself from lawyers.

37:34.921 --> 37:38.158
I think he's gonna
try to get the jury
to send a message.

37:38.191 --> 37:40.961
I plan to be more of
a little guy than Tommy.

37:40.994 --> 37:44.464
Play it simple.
Tell them we had
an innocent man

37:44.497 --> 37:46.332
faced with
losing his life,

37:46.366 --> 37:48.468
and we fought for him.

37:49.402 --> 37:51.705
-Bobby, we got to go.
-Verdict?

37:51.738 --> 37:54.007
We've been
called to chambers.

37:57.711 --> 38:00.480
I just received a question
from the jury,

38:00.514 --> 38:02.382
and I'll tell you
how I plan to respond

38:02.415 --> 38:04.818
and then give counsel
for the state
and the defense

38:04.851 --> 38:07.788
the opportunity to make
any comments or objections.

38:07.821 --> 38:10.223
The question is...

38:10.256 --> 38:12.492
Well, actually,
it's two questions.

38:12.526 --> 38:14.895
First, they would
like to know if they
can have more water.

38:14.928 --> 38:18.298
Second, they would like to
know if killing an infant,

38:18.331 --> 38:22.302
in and of itself,
constitutes extreme cruelty.

38:48.094 --> 38:50.997
So... what's going on?

38:52.766 --> 38:57.704
They're deciding
between murder one
and murder two.

39:02.976 --> 39:04.845
H-how?

39:04.878 --> 39:08.549
The question was
about extreme cruelty,

39:08.582 --> 39:12.385
one of the elements
necessary for
the first-degree charge.

39:13.554 --> 39:15.856
Well, maybe they just
didn't understand it.

39:18.792 --> 39:20.927
That isn't it.

39:20.961 --> 39:24.497
They're not deciding between
guilt or innocence anymore.

39:24.531 --> 39:27.200
It's between
first- and second-degree.

39:27.233 --> 39:32.205
I--I doubt that the D. A.
would be even willing to
offer manslaughter right now,

39:32.238 --> 39:34.841
but...

39:34.875 --> 39:36.677
I should at least try.

39:36.710 --> 39:38.144
No.

39:38.178 --> 39:39.212
Evelyn--

39:39.245 --> 39:40.814
I'm not going to
agree to manslaughter.

39:40.847 --> 39:43.584
Are you even listening
to what I'm telling you?

39:43.617 --> 39:45.418
God won't let them
convict me.

39:45.451 --> 39:47.287
I know He won't.

39:47.320 --> 39:48.488
I know it.

39:48.522 --> 39:51.658
Listen, I think God
has dropped the ball here.

39:51.692 --> 39:54.127
Either that or Helen Gamble
got to him.

39:54.160 --> 39:56.229
You need to
prepare yourself.

39:56.262 --> 39:58.832
It's not
going to happen!

40:07.407 --> 40:10.577
He's going to
take care of me.

40:12.746 --> 40:15.949
Now, if you
could excuse me,
I need to pray.

40:17.417 --> 40:18.952
Honey...

40:18.985 --> 40:21.522
maybe we should
listen to what he's
trying to say here.

40:21.555 --> 40:23.724
I need to pray.

40:42.175 --> 40:43.309
I couldn't believe it,
her face.

40:43.343 --> 40:45.311
She had this
religious blank stare.
She looked like--

40:45.345 --> 40:46.580
Kenneth Starr?

40:46.613 --> 40:48.481
I'm trying to tell her
she's facing life in prison,

40:48.515 --> 40:49.750
and she doesn't
even hear me.

40:49.783 --> 40:51.317
-Have they come back
with a verdict?
-Not yet.

40:51.351 --> 40:53.019
I told you
she was guilty.

40:53.053 --> 40:55.822
Eebie-jeebie lady,
shake, rattle, and roll.

40:55.856 --> 40:57.658
Lucy--

41:00.994 --> 41:03.664
It's not that we don't
think he's any good.

41:03.697 --> 41:05.231
Then why are
we sitting here?

41:05.265 --> 41:06.633
Because this
isn't just any case.

41:06.667 --> 41:08.068
Our whole future
rides on it.

41:08.101 --> 41:10.036
Jimmy may be good,
but he certainly
isn't our best.

41:10.070 --> 41:12.506
We could hire better,
get outside counsel.

41:12.539 --> 41:13.907
I've seen
Tommy Silva at work.

41:13.940 --> 41:16.309
He plays the "regular guy"
thing like a violin.

41:16.342 --> 41:17.678
That's exactly
why we--

41:17.711 --> 41:19.279
Jimmy's style, I still believe,
is the perfect counter.

41:19.312 --> 41:21.181
Lindsay, remember how
he did in the power lines case?

41:21.214 --> 41:22.182
Yes.

41:22.215 --> 41:23.316
The case against us
is stacked--

41:23.349 --> 41:24.851
dead sister,
brother accused,

41:24.885 --> 41:27.253
life ruined,
father dying,

41:27.287 --> 41:28.388
the evil criminal
defense lawyer.

41:28.421 --> 41:30.290
This case is tailor-made
for Tommy Silva.

41:30.323 --> 41:33.426
He will tap into
the people's contempt
for lawyers.

41:33.459 --> 41:35.529
Jimmy is a teddy bear.

41:35.562 --> 41:36.797
He's good.

41:36.830 --> 41:39.065
In my opinion,
he represents
our best chance.

41:39.099 --> 41:41.134
All right, why don't
we just take a vote?

41:41.167 --> 41:42.803
All against.

41:47.574 --> 41:51.812
All for? Mine counts
for two, remember?

41:54.848 --> 41:57.417
Rebecca,
you're a partner, too.

41:57.450 --> 41:58.819
He can take
all your property
as well.

41:58.852 --> 42:01.121
Ellenor,
let her make up
her own mind.

42:02.422 --> 42:04.157
I'm with Bobby.

42:08.394 --> 42:12.365
Three to three.
I decide tiebreakers.
Jimmy's got the case.

42:12.398 --> 42:14.434
-Wait a second.
-You can't do that.

42:14.467 --> 42:15.736
You basically
have three votes now?

42:15.769 --> 42:16.870
It's in
the partnership.

42:16.903 --> 42:19.506
Jimmy will
first chair,
I'll be second.

42:19.540 --> 42:21.041
Who won?

42:21.074 --> 42:22.308
-Lucy!
-Get out!

42:22.342 --> 42:23.644
The jury's back now.

42:23.677 --> 42:24.911
Thirty minutes.

42:24.945 --> 42:26.312
Okay.

42:29.382 --> 42:31.117
Jimmy, quick vote.
Your case.

42:31.151 --> 42:32.218
Congratulations.

42:32.252 --> 42:33.520
You'll do great,
Jimmy.

42:33.554 --> 42:35.121
Good luck, buddy.

42:57.844 --> 43:00.113
Will the defendant
please rise?

43:07.788 --> 43:10.624
Mr. Foreman, the jury
has reached a verdict?

43:10.657 --> 43:11.758
We have, Your Honor.

43:11.792 --> 43:13.627
JUDGE:
What say you?

43:14.861 --> 43:17.163
"Commonwealth
vs. Evelyn Mayfield.

43:17.197 --> 43:19.800
On the count of murder
in the first degree,

43:19.833 --> 43:22.636
we find the defendant
Evelyn Mayfield...

43:22.669 --> 43:23.804
not guilty."

43:23.837 --> 43:25.839
-(crowd murmurs)
-MAN: Oh! Wonderful!

43:25.872 --> 43:27.808
"On the count of murder
in the second degree,

43:27.841 --> 43:31.878
we find the defendant
Evelyn Mayfield...

43:31.912 --> 43:33.113
guilty."

43:33.146 --> 43:36.883
JUDGE:
The bailiff will take
the defendant into custody.

43:36.917 --> 43:40.521
The jury is dismissed
with the thanks
of the court.

43:40.554 --> 43:42.756
We are adjourned.

43:52.833 --> 43:55.235
I'm filing a motion

43:55.268 --> 43:58.271
for the judge to consider
reducing the verdict
to manslaughter.

43:58.304 --> 43:59.806
I don't expect
it to fly--

43:59.840 --> 44:01.407
We can appeal, right?

44:01.441 --> 44:03.443
Yeah.

44:03.476 --> 44:05.746
We'll appeal,
we'll win.

44:05.779 --> 44:07.447
It won't end like this.

44:07.480 --> 44:09.883
It'll be okay, Bobby.

44:14.988 --> 44:16.422
Yeah.

44:58.298 --> 44:59.566
You stinker!
