WEBVTT

00:04.705 --> 00:07.339
Can I have
Willie's meatloaf, Kate?

00:07.341 --> 00:09.274
No!

00:09.276 --> 00:11.043
Fine.

00:14.482 --> 00:16.315
If Willie isn't home by midnight

00:16.317 --> 00:18.317
then can I have his meatloaf?

00:19.920 --> 00:22.888
- Hi, honey.
- Hi, everybody.

00:22.890 --> 00:23.922
- Hi, dad.
- Hi, dad.

00:23.924 --> 00:25.424
Can I have your meatloaf?

00:25.426 --> 00:26.558
No.

00:26.560 --> 00:28.527
Let Willie answer.

00:28.529 --> 00:31.230
- Willie?
- No.

00:31.232 --> 00:32.598
Shoot!

00:33.901 --> 00:35.901
Honey, how was
the union meeting?

00:35.903 --> 00:37.703
Well, they elected me
picket captain.

00:37.705 --> 00:38.904
What does that tell you?

00:38.906 --> 00:40.639
Oh, you're going on strike?

00:40.641 --> 00:43.542
[inhales deeply]
I'm afraid so.

00:43.544 --> 00:44.977
Oh.

00:44.979 --> 00:47.613
Just the thought of it
gives me a sick feeling

00:47.615 --> 00:49.848
in the pit of my stomach.

00:49.850 --> 00:52.618
Then meatloaf would only
make you more queasy.

00:54.221 --> 00:57.222
[theme music]

01:27.321 --> 01:30.122
[music continues]

01:55.549 --> 01:58.350
[theme music]

02:06.794 --> 02:08.660
- Willie?
- Oh.

02:10.197 --> 02:11.897
Honey, what's wrong?

02:11.899 --> 02:15.367
Oh, it's this strike.

02:15.369 --> 02:18.670
I'm afraid it's gonna last
for quite a while.

02:18.672 --> 02:20.372
Oh, honey,
we've got our savings.

02:20.374 --> 02:21.573
We'll be okay for now.

02:21.575 --> 02:23.575
Well, it's not just that, Kate.

02:23.577 --> 02:26.945
There are a lot of people
that depend on social services.

02:26.947 --> 02:29.515
Where are they gonna turn
when we're not there?

02:29.517 --> 02:31.150
Willie, you work hard.

02:31.152 --> 02:33.652
You're entitled
to fair compensation.

02:33.654 --> 02:35.921
Now, in any strike
there are innocent people

02:35.923 --> 02:38.657
who are gonna suffer,
but on the other hand

02:38.659 --> 02:40.292
if you feel justified
in your demands

02:40.294 --> 02:42.294
you cannot really assume
responsibility for every--

02:42.296 --> 02:43.462
Kate?

02:43.464 --> 02:44.663
Yeah?

02:44.665 --> 02:46.698
I think I can sleep now.

02:50.337 --> 02:51.904
Question.

02:51.906 --> 02:54.239
Perhaps I spoke too soon.

02:55.409 --> 02:56.708
Bottom line.

02:56.710 --> 02:58.343
I'm concerned
about how this strike

02:58.345 --> 03:01.380
is gonna effect everyone,
especially me.

03:02.750 --> 03:06.151
Spoken like a true humanitarian.

03:06.153 --> 03:10.522
I know. And I have the solution
in five simple words.

03:10.524 --> 03:13.425
Willie gets a-nother job.

03:14.261 --> 03:16.061
That's four words.

03:16.063 --> 03:18.997
Good, I ran out of fingers.

03:18.999 --> 03:20.999
You know, as a matter of fact,
I was just thinking

03:21.001 --> 03:23.202
that<i> I</i> should go back to work.

03:23.204 --> 03:25.837
Hah hah hah!

03:25.839 --> 03:28.240
Good one, Kate!

03:29.543 --> 03:31.710
I have always worked, ALF.

03:31.712 --> 03:33.178
I sold real estate, by choice

03:33.180 --> 03:35.681
until I got pregnant
with Lynn, by choice.

03:35.683 --> 03:37.082
I went back to work,
by choice

03:37.084 --> 03:38.984
until I got pregnant
with Brian, by choice.

03:38.986 --> 03:42.421
And I was just getting ready
to go back to work, by choice..

03:42.423 --> 03:44.656
...when we got you.

03:44.658 --> 03:47.259
I have a gut feeling
I'm not gonna hear the words

03:47.261 --> 03:50.095
"By choice."

03:50.097 --> 03:53.699
ALF, you know we're glad
you're part of this family.

03:53.701 --> 03:59.104
We are, ALF. Even at this
inconveniently late hour.

03:59.106 --> 04:01.473
Then isn't it time
we made it official?

04:02.476 --> 04:03.942
Made what official?

04:03.944 --> 04:05.410
My adoption.

04:06.780 --> 04:08.981
Oh, I don't even think
we can do that.

04:08.983 --> 04:11.216
Can we?
No, we can't do that.

04:12.353 --> 04:13.885
Why not?

04:13.887 --> 04:17.556
Well, for starters..

04:17.558 --> 04:19.558
...there's that species thing.

04:21.061 --> 04:22.294
It doesn't bother you

04:22.296 --> 04:24.396
that I don't bear
the Tanner name?

04:25.399 --> 04:27.499
No.

04:27.501 --> 04:30.102
ALF, please.
Go back to bed.

04:31.505 --> 04:33.872
But, Kate, if you get a job

04:33.874 --> 04:35.941
who's gonna take care of me?

04:35.943 --> 04:39.177
Willie will be here.

04:39.179 --> 04:42.748
No offense,
but, Kate, if you get a job

04:42.750 --> 04:44.916
who's gonna take care of me?

04:46.453 --> 04:49.288
ALF, you're 231 years old.

04:49.290 --> 04:52.190
You should be able
to take care of yourself by now.

04:54.228 --> 04:56.828
You'd think so, wouldn't you?

04:56.830 --> 04:59.031
[instrumental music]

04:59.867 --> 05:03.068
[instrumental music]

05:08.842 --> 05:11.410
- Hi, ALF.
- Yo, Bri.

05:12.079 --> 05:13.745
What you watchin'?

05:13.747 --> 05:15.213
"Love Connection," "Bonanza"

05:15.215 --> 05:16.882
"People's Court,"
"Divorce Court"

05:16.884 --> 05:18.817
"Superior Court,"
"Surfer Hawks"

05:18.819 --> 05:20.919
"Oprah," "Phil," "Geraldo"

05:20.921 --> 05:23.155
and some movie with Dean Jones.

05:24.058 --> 05:25.824
Doesn't that make you dizzy?

05:25.826 --> 05:27.192
Yeah.

05:28.495 --> 05:29.661
Hey, where you going?

05:29.663 --> 05:31.330
Homework.

05:32.132 --> 05:34.599
Are you calling mom again?

05:34.601 --> 05:36.134
Call Kate?

05:36.136 --> 05:38.704
Why would I call
the woman who abandoned me

05:38.706 --> 05:40.505
in my century of need?

05:43.544 --> 05:45.010
[sighs]

05:47.081 --> 05:49.848
Tough day on the line,
Norma Rae?

05:49.850 --> 05:52.317
Please stop calling me that.

05:52.319 --> 05:54.753
I called you that
because I like you.

05:54.755 --> 05:56.955
I really like you.

05:57.791 --> 05:59.591
Oh.

05:59.593 --> 06:04.563
Boy, I feel like I walked
about 50 miles today.

06:04.565 --> 06:07.032
Say, you're not calling
Kate again, are you?

06:07.034 --> 06:09.334
For your information,
I'm calling for the time.

06:12.773 --> 06:14.673
Kate? What time is it?

06:16.377 --> 06:17.609
Thank you.

06:22.316 --> 06:23.382
Willie?

06:24.818 --> 06:26.952
Yes, ALF?

06:26.954 --> 06:28.620
Are you asleep?

06:29.990 --> 06:32.424
Yes, I am, and deeply so.

06:33.660 --> 06:35.694
Well, I guess it doesn't
bother you then, huh?

06:37.064 --> 06:39.398
You guess
what doesn't bother me?

06:39.400 --> 06:41.833
That you don't
have a job anymore.

06:41.835 --> 06:43.402
I have a job.

06:43.404 --> 06:46.138
Then why aren't you
going to it?

06:46.140 --> 06:48.673
I explained this
to you already, ALF.

06:49.910 --> 06:52.043
Not to my satisfaction.

06:53.347 --> 06:56.381
[sighs]
In business..

06:56.383 --> 06:58.984
...there is something
called management

06:58.986 --> 07:01.153
and something called labor.

07:01.155 --> 07:04.623
Wait, wait, wait.
Let me get comfortable.

07:06.727 --> 07:07.959
Management--

07:07.961 --> 07:10.495
Can you hand me my soda, Willie?

07:13.066 --> 07:15.000
- Management--
- And the chips.

07:19.406 --> 07:21.206
And a napkin.

07:30.784 --> 07:33.752
- Are you ready?
- Not quite.

07:34.922 --> 07:38.123
[cracks knuckles]

07:47.401 --> 07:48.733
Ready.

07:51.138 --> 07:54.039
Management hires labor to..

07:54.775 --> 07:56.441
...well..

07:56.443 --> 07:58.143
...labor.

07:59.246 --> 08:01.313
What does management do?

08:02.749 --> 08:05.417
Nobody's quite sure.

08:05.419 --> 08:06.852
Anyway, when..

08:06.854 --> 08:08.653
[slurping]

08:08.655 --> 08:11.022
When labor feels that they're

08:11.024 --> 08:13.124
not being treated fairly

08:13.126 --> 08:15.026
for example, if they feel
they're not being

08:15.028 --> 08:16.495
paid enough, then--

08:16.497 --> 08:19.297
I never thought I'd say this,
weeping willow

08:19.299 --> 08:21.800
but Kate's more fun
to have around than you are.

08:23.770 --> 08:26.071
Remember how she used to look?

08:26.773 --> 08:28.940
Smiling.

08:28.942 --> 08:30.709
Serving food.

08:32.045 --> 08:34.412
Following me around
with a Johnny mop.

08:36.083 --> 08:38.884
- Now she's dead.
- She's not dead!

08:38.886 --> 08:41.086
She's just working.

08:41.088 --> 08:44.689
Dead, working, same thing.

08:44.691 --> 08:47.192
Did it ever occur to you
that Kate might want

08:47.194 --> 08:50.161
to have a little more
out of life?

08:50.163 --> 08:52.464
If it ain't broke,
don't step on it.

08:52.466 --> 08:53.698
Fix it.

08:53.700 --> 08:55.634
Fix what?

08:55.636 --> 08:56.902
The expression is

08:56.904 --> 08:59.604
"If it ain't broke,
don't fix it."

09:00.774 --> 09:02.807
Why would you?

09:05.646 --> 09:07.546
Go, call Kate.

09:07.548 --> 09:10.782
Why?
I already know what time it is.

09:11.985 --> 09:14.185
Get the weather.

09:16.790 --> 09:19.791
[instrumental music]

09:24.097 --> 09:26.364
See? I told you it would all
come back to you.

09:26.366 --> 09:27.799
It's just like
riding a bicycle.

09:27.801 --> 09:29.434
[sighs]
Oh-ho, yeah.

09:29.436 --> 09:31.269
A bicycle with
new tax regulations

09:31.271 --> 09:32.504
variable interests rates

09:32.506 --> 09:34.039
balloon payments,
escrow charges--

09:34.041 --> 09:36.942
You don't have to worry
about everything at once.

09:36.944 --> 09:39.978
Why don't you just start
with the Romansky mortgage?

09:39.980 --> 09:41.179
Go ahead,
compute the interest rate.

09:41.181 --> 09:42.447
Okay.

09:42.449 --> 09:44.716
You think they can
swing it at..

09:44.718 --> 09:46.585
Hmm.

09:46.587 --> 09:49.020
...two hundred
and sixty seven percent?

09:49.022 --> 09:50.956
Well, if they cut back
in other areas.

09:50.958 --> 09:52.123
[chuckles]

09:52.125 --> 09:53.959
Here, try it like this.

09:53.961 --> 09:56.161
[keys clacking]

09:56.763 --> 09:59.130
Oh! Oh!

10:00.033 --> 10:01.433
[telephone rings]

10:03.103 --> 10:04.436
Kate Tanner.

10:04.438 --> 10:06.638
(ALF on phone)
'I knew that.'

10:06.640 --> 10:09.140
Hi there.

10:09.142 --> 10:11.676
Why are you calling me
here again?

10:12.312 --> 10:14.212
Willie told me to.

10:14.715 --> 10:16.181
Nice try.

10:16.183 --> 10:17.449
No, he did. He did.

10:17.451 --> 10:19.451
He wanted me to ask you
about the weather.

10:20.654 --> 10:22.454
How about stormy?

10:24.057 --> 10:27.726
Did you have a special reason
for calling me again?

10:27.728 --> 10:29.761
Well, yeah, yeah.

10:29.763 --> 10:31.696
I have a question.

10:31.698 --> 10:34.466
How long does this
career thing usually last?

10:35.469 --> 10:38.870
ALF, we have been over this.

10:38.872 --> 10:40.005
I am here because I want to be.

10:40.007 --> 10:41.573
I want to work, I like to work

10:41.575 --> 10:44.142
I always planned
to come back to work.

10:44.144 --> 10:46.411
How can I make you
understand this?

10:46.413 --> 10:49.614
He thinks the lady
doth protest her lunch.

10:51.018 --> 10:53.251
- Too much.
- Too much what?

10:54.087 --> 10:55.887
I'm hanging up now.

10:57.491 --> 11:00.759
Yep. Definitely stormy.

11:00.761 --> 11:03.762
[instrumental music]

11:08.435 --> 11:12.203
Mmm, Brian, w-would you
hand me the garlic press?

11:12.205 --> 11:14.339
What's a garlic press look like?

11:14.341 --> 11:16.875
Well, it-it's right there
next to the garlic.

11:16.877 --> 11:19.678
What's a garlic look like?

11:19.680 --> 11:21.579
Haven't you ever helped
your mom in the kitchen?

11:21.581 --> 11:24.315
Sure, I say,
"Mom, it's burning."

11:24.317 --> 11:26.818
And she says,
"Thanks, Bri."

11:26.820 --> 11:29.754
I promise not to burn
the pasta primavera.

11:30.991 --> 11:33.758
Pasta primavera?

11:33.760 --> 11:35.960
I thought we were
having spaghetti.

11:35.962 --> 11:37.262
It is spaghetti.

11:37.264 --> 11:38.797
It's spaghetti with broccoli

11:38.799 --> 11:40.432
and peas and zucchini

11:40.434 --> 11:42.967
and a light tomato cream sauce.

11:42.969 --> 11:45.470
Well, I like the sauce
that Kate opens.

11:46.640 --> 11:49.941
How come there's weeds
in this salad?

11:49.943 --> 11:51.509
They aren't weeds.

11:51.511 --> 11:54.312
That's radicchio.

11:54.314 --> 11:56.781
The whole idea
of you cooking is radicchio.

12:00.387 --> 12:01.920
- Hi, everybody.
- Hi.

12:01.922 --> 12:04.355
- Hi.
- Oh, hi, honey.

12:04.357 --> 12:06.391
You're-you're kinda
late getting home.

12:06.393 --> 12:08.326
Yeah, Julie and I
stayed after school

12:08.328 --> 12:10.328
to protest cheerleading tryouts.

12:11.164 --> 12:12.831
Well, why would you do that?

12:12.833 --> 12:15.066
I was protesting
because I think cheerleading

12:15.068 --> 12:16.634
is a sexist exploitation

12:16.636 --> 12:20.004
of the concept of woman
as perennial spectator.

12:20.006 --> 12:22.207
Julie was protesting
because she was eliminated

12:22.209 --> 12:24.209
in the first round.

12:24.211 --> 12:26.511
Mmm, pasta primavera.

12:26.513 --> 12:30.415
You see?
Lynn appreciates my cooking.

12:30.417 --> 12:32.317
Sure, scrape off
the vegetables

12:32.319 --> 12:34.319
and that pink stuff
and it's great.

12:35.655 --> 12:37.756
Anything I can do to help?

12:37.758 --> 12:39.891
Yeah, you could
take the radicchio

12:39.893 --> 12:42.127
out of this salad.

12:42.129 --> 12:44.462
No, everything's
timed perfectly.

12:44.464 --> 12:47.999
The pasta's on
a slow rolling boil

12:48.001 --> 12:50.535
the sauce is simmering nicely.

12:50.537 --> 12:52.303
Dinner will be ready in exactly

12:52.305 --> 12:54.372
one minute and twelve seconds.

12:55.876 --> 12:57.876
What's this stuff?

12:58.745 --> 13:02.347
Will you stay out
of that salad?

13:09.456 --> 13:12.557
Yikes! The radicchio
is making a break for it!

13:13.827 --> 13:17.929
ALF, I want you
to clean this mess up

13:17.931 --> 13:21.533
and I want you
to stay out of my way.

13:21.535 --> 13:23.468
- Dad?
- What?

13:23.470 --> 13:25.436
I think your spaghetti's done.

13:25.906 --> 13:27.739
Oh! Ah!

13:29.276 --> 13:31.810
- Here, here, here.
- Ah!

'ALF, it's Kate. Can I come in?'

14:02.876 --> 14:06.010
Kate? The name
is vaguely familiar.

14:06.012 --> 14:08.379
And I've heard
that voice before.

14:11.518 --> 14:13.518
'Oh, it's you.'

14:13.520 --> 14:16.921
You look terrible.
All white and tired and old.

14:16.923 --> 14:18.723
How's the job going?

14:19.626 --> 14:21.826
The job is fine, thank you.

14:21.828 --> 14:23.628
Oh, I'm so glad.

14:26.499 --> 14:28.666
I never realized there were
so many pictures of me.

14:29.703 --> 14:31.736
Let alone here in the garage.

14:34.007 --> 14:35.206
Well, don't worry.

14:35.208 --> 14:37.709
You're not wearing lingerie
in any of these.

14:37.711 --> 14:40.712
[chuckles]
Well, that's a comfort.

14:40.714 --> 14:43.114
I gave the lingerie shots
to Willie.

14:44.951 --> 14:46.451
You t-took..

14:46.453 --> 14:48.519
Kidding.

14:48.521 --> 14:50.188
Thank goodness.

14:50.190 --> 14:52.724
Had you, didn't I?

14:52.726 --> 14:54.893
Okay, ALF, out with it.

14:54.895 --> 14:56.361
Out with what?

14:56.363 --> 14:59.764
Look...ALF,
I know you pretty well.

14:59.766 --> 15:01.933
And I can tell when you're
upset about something.

15:03.803 --> 15:04.936
Well..

15:06.373 --> 15:09.574
...if, uh,
hypothetically speaking

15:09.576 --> 15:11.910
something were to upset me..

15:11.912 --> 15:13.978
...and I'm not saying
anything has, but..

15:13.980 --> 15:17.081
- Hypothetically.
- Right.

15:17.083 --> 15:21.719
If someone close to me...were
to return to work, let's say..

15:21.721 --> 15:25.023
...it might,
in the cosmos of my psyche..

15:25.025 --> 15:28.660
...create an emotional
black hole.

15:28.662 --> 15:30.261
- Hypothetically.
- Hypothetically.

15:30.263 --> 15:34.565
ALF, why has my going back
to work upset you so much?

15:34.567 --> 15:37.068
Everything's changing too fast!

15:37.070 --> 15:38.536
What do you mean?

15:38.538 --> 15:40.038
Well, you got a job now.

15:40.040 --> 15:42.807
Lynn's starting college
pretty soon.

15:42.809 --> 15:44.509
Brian beat me
at chutes and ladders

15:44.511 --> 15:46.444
just the other day.

15:46.446 --> 15:50.415
I wish things could stay
just the way they used to be..

15:50.417 --> 15:54.652
...in the good old days.
Last week.

15:54.654 --> 15:57.021
ALF, everybody feels
that way sometimes

15:57.023 --> 16:00.158
but listen, change can be
a very positive thing.

16:01.161 --> 16:02.493
Oh, yeah?

16:02.495 --> 16:04.462
Every time my life changed

16:04.464 --> 16:06.731
it seemed like
my world fell apart.

16:07.701 --> 16:09.767
Like when my world fell apart.

16:11.171 --> 16:15.306
ALF, things do change.
Lynn and Brian are growing up.

16:15.308 --> 16:18.009
I have a new job.
And who knows?

16:18.011 --> 16:19.644
Tomorrow, Willie may decide
to chuck it all

16:19.646 --> 16:21.579
and become a lobster fisherman.

16:22.682 --> 16:25.350
Shellfish makes him wheeze,
remember?

16:25.352 --> 16:27.652
I was speaking hypothetically.

16:28.221 --> 16:30.121
Oh.

16:30.123 --> 16:34.125
But, ALF,
one thing never will change

16:34.127 --> 16:37.128
and that's the fact that
you're a part of our family.

16:38.465 --> 16:40.631
You decided to adopt me?

16:41.935 --> 16:44.235
I thought we explained
that to you.

16:44.237 --> 16:46.404
It would make me feel
a lot more secure

16:46.406 --> 16:48.873
about my position
in the family.

16:48.875 --> 16:51.709
Now, ALF, you know
that's impossible.

16:51.711 --> 16:54.078
I'll give you a dollar.

16:54.080 --> 16:57.048
(Willie)
You in there? Hey, great news!

16:57.050 --> 16:59.050
- The strike is over!
- Oh!

16:59.052 --> 17:02.720
Hah! I'm gonna go..
I'm gonna go back..

17:02.722 --> 17:04.622
I'm going back to work on..

17:04.624 --> 17:06.457
...on Mon-Monda..

17:06.459 --> 17:07.725
W-why are there
pictures of my wife

17:07.727 --> 17:08.926
all over the garage?

17:08.928 --> 17:10.928
Oh, honey,
I'll explain that later.

17:10.930 --> 17:13.064
I'm so happy
you're going back to work!

17:13.066 --> 17:14.198
Me too!

17:14.200 --> 17:16.901
Now Kate can quit her job
and come home

17:16.903 --> 17:19.637
and make me salad without weeds.

17:19.639 --> 17:22.073
Radicchio.

17:22.075 --> 17:25.710
ALF, haven't you been listening
to a word I've been saying?

17:25.712 --> 17:27.745
Well, I have been known
to tune you out.

17:28.848 --> 17:30.715
ALF, just because Willie
is going back to work

17:30.717 --> 17:32.717
doesn't mean
I'm gonna quit my job.

17:32.719 --> 17:35.219
Not even if I say please?

17:36.222 --> 17:38.222
I'm sorry, ALF.

17:40.093 --> 17:43.127
She doesn't take any guff,
does she?

17:43.129 --> 17:44.362

Hi, Kate.

18:07.620 --> 18:09.487
Hi, honey.

18:09.489 --> 18:11.689
Hi, ALF. Hi, Willie.

18:13.359 --> 18:16.027
Willie...um..

18:17.363 --> 18:20.765
...uh, re-remember
the first time that..

18:20.767 --> 18:22.934
...that I stopped working?

18:22.936 --> 18:25.002
Um-m-m..

18:25.004 --> 18:27.305
...it was when
you were expecting Lynn.

18:28.641 --> 18:31.008
Well..

18:31.010 --> 18:33.111
...do you remember
the second time?

18:33.113 --> 18:35.313
When you were expecting Brian.

18:36.749 --> 18:38.616
Well, you know..

18:38.618 --> 18:40.518
...I haven't been
feeling too great lately

18:40.520 --> 18:43.654
and, um...
I've been feeling

18:43.656 --> 18:45.423
you know, kind of tired.

18:45.425 --> 18:49.260
Well, gosh...honey,
you ought to see a doctor.

18:49.262 --> 18:51.129
I did.

18:51.131 --> 18:52.463
Willie, you lox!

18:52.465 --> 18:55.800

she's about to spawn again!

- Yeah.

Great! A new baby!

19:07.547 --> 19:09.914
We'll raise him as our own!

19:09.916 --> 19:13.718
Well, he or she
will be our own.

19:14.654 --> 19:18.356
Well, as our own.
It's not our own.

19:18.358 --> 19:19.991
Lynn! Brian!

19:19.993 --> 19:21.993
Come here, I want
to tell you something!

19:23.196 --> 19:25.863
- I love you.
- Oh, I love you.

What's up, dad?

19:30.203 --> 19:31.502

19:32.805 --> 19:35.773

- No, I'm not kidding.
