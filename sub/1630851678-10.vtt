WEBVTT

00:06.381 --> 00:07.591
[jackhammer rumbling]

00:07.716 --> 00:12.054
[theme song playing]

00:42.125 --> 00:44.169
[frogs croaking]

00:46.213 --> 00:48.215
[frogs croaking]

00:55.305 --> 00:58.725
Do you know why
they call me Mr. X, Jenny?

01:00.060 --> 01:01.186
Right you are, Jenny.

01:01.311 --> 01:05.566
Because I deal specifically
with extraterrestrials.

01:05.566 --> 01:09.069
And rumor has it
that there are a few
in the area.

01:09.194 --> 01:10.779
Hit it, Jenners.

01:14.866 --> 01:17.619
Very good, Jenny.
Very nice.

01:17.619 --> 01:19.204
This is why
you're the best.

01:20.414 --> 01:23.375
Oh, Jenny, honey,
are you blushing?

01:24.334 --> 01:27.421
But who is this,
I wonder?

01:27.421 --> 01:29.423
Little Miss String Bean.

01:32.301 --> 01:35.846
Uh‐huh. Sounds like
some real '80s movie junk.

01:35.971 --> 01:37.389
But one thing's for sure.

01:37.514 --> 01:39.891
These aliens
are being sheltered.

01:39.891 --> 01:44.563
And whoever is harboring
these little monsters
will be in big trouble‐‐

01:44.563 --> 01:45.939
[knocking]

01:47.441 --> 01:48.608
[tune playing]

01:48.608 --> 01:50.277
One Popsicle, please?

01:50.277 --> 01:53.155
Sorry, little man.
This was the last one.

01:53.155 --> 01:54.906
[slurps] Mmm.

01:56.408 --> 01:58.076
Uh, give me a sec.

01:58.076 --> 01:59.786
[strains, groans]

01:59.911 --> 02:00.954
[slurps]

02:01.955 --> 02:03.665
Now, we've got
to get these aliens

02:03.665 --> 02:06.752
before someone
gets abducted or worse.

02:06.877 --> 02:08.420
[stomach growling]

02:08.545 --> 02:10.630
Okay, we need
some real food.

02:12.549 --> 02:16.094
Jenny, Jenny,
you've done it again.

02:18.764 --> 02:22.643
Is it just me,
or is anyone feeling amped up
since we fought the robot?

02:22.726 --> 02:24.519
Kick that robot.
What you mean?

02:24.603 --> 02:27.898
Remember I was all, "Whapow"!
And you were like...
[mimics karate yell]

02:27.898 --> 02:31.151
Sounds like you got a case
of post‐battle euphoria.

02:31.151 --> 02:34.279
Nothing like a brush with death
to make you feel alive.

02:34.279 --> 02:36.782
So, what's next?
I'm ready to fight.

02:36.782 --> 02:38.116
Hopefully, nothing.

02:38.116 --> 02:40.118
Unless Andrias sends
another robot,

02:40.118 --> 02:41.119
we're safe for now.

02:41.244 --> 02:42.496
So I'm taking the Plantars

02:42.621 --> 02:43.622
to their first movie.

02:43.747 --> 02:45.624
Well, if anything comes up,
we're ready.

02:45.624 --> 02:47.959
I even broke out
an old pull‐up bar.
Look.

02:48.085 --> 02:51.088
[grunting]

02:52.089 --> 02:54.508
Ah, my back!
Honey, be careful.

02:54.508 --> 02:57.678
Guys, please.
Leave the danger to us,
okay?

02:57.761 --> 03:00.055
Mm‐hmm.
Now movie time.

03:00.055 --> 03:01.056
[all whooping]

03:03.642 --> 03:05.143
[all gasp]

03:07.104 --> 03:09.022
[chattering]

03:09.147 --> 03:10.857
[screaming]

03:10.857 --> 03:14.194
Hello, sensory overload!

03:14.194 --> 03:16.571
Whoa! What is this, a church?

03:16.571 --> 03:18.407
Yeah, pretty much. [sighs]

03:18.407 --> 03:20.742
What's the matter?
Just thinking
about my folks.

03:20.742 --> 03:23.245
I don't like the idea
of putting those two
in harm's way.

03:23.328 --> 03:25.122
I know we took down
that robot together,

03:25.122 --> 03:26.957
but they're
still just parents,
you know?

03:26.957 --> 03:29.418
They shop for groceries
and coach Little League T‐ball.

03:29.418 --> 03:34.089
Well, luckily today
is a stress‐free day
with no danger or conflict.

03:37.217 --> 03:38.844
Hello.
Welcome to Thai Go.

03:41.513 --> 03:42.514
[in Thai]

03:42.639 --> 03:44.474
[in Thai]

03:46.309 --> 03:48.478
I was stationed in Phuket
for a bit.

03:48.603 --> 03:50.230
We'll take one Pad see ew.

03:50.355 --> 03:52.232
And while we're at it,

03:52.232 --> 03:55.110
have you seen any odd creatures
walking around?

03:55.110 --> 03:57.279
Probably disguised as... humans?

03:58.905 --> 04:03.201
[laughs]
What strange shapes they are!
Haven't seen them. Who's asking?

04:03.285 --> 04:07.038
Oh, just your friendly
neighborhood federal government.

04:08.373 --> 04:11.209
Yes. Very nice.
Hooray government!

04:11.209 --> 04:12.210
[in Thai]

04:12.210 --> 04:14.504
Jeez, where's the fire? Hmm?

04:18.717 --> 04:23.138
Gotta go!
Is your stun gun charged, Jenny?
Tell me it's charged!

04:24.639 --> 04:27.893
Uh...
We have to go now.
I'll explain on the way.

04:28.477 --> 04:30.145
[tires screeching]

04:30.228 --> 04:32.189
[ringing]

04:32.272 --> 04:33.857
Come on, come on.

04:33.940 --> 04:35.525
[vibrating]

04:37.903 --> 04:41.281
[announcer] And now...
for what you've all
been waiting for.

04:41.406 --> 04:42.616
Another trailer!

04:42.616 --> 04:44.910
[whooping]

04:45.035 --> 04:46.787
Twenty minutes of trailers?

04:46.912 --> 04:49.247
And you keep
calling yourself civilized.

04:49.873 --> 04:51.249
[roaring]

04:51.249 --> 04:54.127
Anyone else feel like
this audio video experience

04:54.211 --> 04:56.630
is a little overwhelming?

04:56.713 --> 05:01.218
Entertainment that makes
your ears bleed?
I'm here for it, baby!

05:01.301 --> 05:04.221
I have to admit,
it is pretty difficult
to hear anything.

05:04.221 --> 05:05.889
[dinosaur roaring]

05:05.972 --> 05:08.141
[vibrating]

05:08.225 --> 05:11.311
[horns honking]

05:11.311 --> 05:12.687
She's not answering.

05:12.687 --> 05:15.065
[groans]
We're gonna lose him
in the traffic!

05:15.065 --> 05:17.484
That's because you drive
like an old man!
Move over!

05:18.109 --> 05:20.320
[yelling]

05:20.320 --> 05:23.907
[electronic music playing]

05:23.907 --> 05:26.409
[tires screeching]

05:26.493 --> 05:28.829
Man, this city, I tell ya!

05:34.960 --> 05:35.877
[yells]
Oh, no!

05:37.212 --> 05:39.464
Well, it was
no Suspicion Island.

05:39.589 --> 05:40.674
[loudly] What did you say?

05:40.674 --> 05:42.634
I thought
the protagonist was pretty fun.

05:42.634 --> 05:45.428
I liked that
she was very flawed
and had room to grow.

05:54.479 --> 05:55.522
Oh, crud.

05:55.647 --> 05:56.731
Back inside, gang.

05:56.815 --> 05:58.233
[Sprig]
No, not another one!

06:03.321 --> 06:04.322
[chuckles]

06:05.407 --> 06:07.284
Guys, there's
a secret agent after us!

06:07.367 --> 06:10.245
We have to find a way
out of this place
without him finding‐‐

06:10.871 --> 06:11.955
Tell me,

06:11.955 --> 06:13.582
are you folks from the area?

06:13.665 --> 06:15.125
Or just visiting?

06:15.208 --> 06:16.585
[all scream]

06:16.585 --> 06:19.254
Oh, how I love a good chase.

06:27.637 --> 06:29.931
I think we lost him.
Great. Don't stop.

06:29.931 --> 06:31.099
Wait! Stop!

06:33.184 --> 06:34.185
Huh?

06:36.730 --> 06:39.274
I think
I just won something.

06:39.274 --> 06:40.650
[vibrating]

06:40.734 --> 06:43.278
They're watching the exit.
We need to find another way out.

06:43.361 --> 06:44.738
We coming in to help.
No!

06:44.863 --> 06:47.282
I don't want you
getting in trouble.
We can handle it.

06:47.282 --> 06:50.410
Tell her we are adults,
and we know what we're doing.

06:50.410 --> 06:53.455
Anne, your mother says‐‐
Hang on,
I'm putting you on speaker.

06:53.455 --> 06:55.457
Okay, let's see.
How do we do this?

06:55.457 --> 06:57.292
[in Thai]

06:57.292 --> 06:58.543
What?
[Dad] Oops!

06:58.543 --> 06:59.711
I think I accidentally‐‐

06:59.836 --> 07:02.589
[in Thai]

07:05.300 --> 07:07.636
Oh, hi, Grandma.
Yeah, I just had a sandwich.

07:07.636 --> 07:11.306
Mom, Dad, just stay in the car.
We're safe.
We'll meet you outside.

07:11.389 --> 07:13.141
Bye, Grandma. Love you.

07:16.478 --> 07:19.022
[laser humming]

07:19.022 --> 07:21.358
Ah, that tickles
my brain.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.860
How do we get them out?
They're cornered.

07:23.943 --> 07:26.488
I have an idea.
Not only how to get them out,

07:26.488 --> 07:28.406
but to deal with
these agents, too.

07:28.406 --> 07:30.533
Quick! To the pet store!

07:30.533 --> 07:33.328
[yells] Honey, take it easy!

07:33.411 --> 07:35.997
Okay, okay.
Get it together, Anne.
Think.

07:35.997 --> 07:38.500
What we're going to
need to do first is‐‐ Hmm?

07:41.544 --> 07:42.545
Hide!

07:44.381 --> 07:46.383
Well, this is getting fun.

07:51.554 --> 07:52.931
Oh, good. It's a dead end.

07:54.224 --> 07:57.477
Ah! Classic.
Everyone, hide.

08:01.940 --> 08:03.775
Now, what could this be?

08:04.651 --> 08:06.611
‐What the‐‐
‐Now, guys!

08:06.611 --> 08:08.697
‐Oh, no, you don't!
‐[yells]

08:10.198 --> 08:11.116
[grunts]

08:11.199 --> 08:12.117
Ow!

08:12.701 --> 08:14.077
[grunts]

08:15.286 --> 08:18.415
[gasps] What even are you?

08:18.498 --> 08:21.501
And why are yo so slimy? Ugh!

08:21.501 --> 08:22.585
Rude!

08:23.753 --> 08:25.505
Blegh!

08:25.505 --> 08:27.590
Ya! Ha ha!

08:37.642 --> 08:39.728
Jenny, you're not
gonna believe this.

08:39.811 --> 08:43.773
They're big, beautiful
talking frog monsters!

08:45.108 --> 08:46.443
Call in the troops.

08:46.443 --> 08:48.570
[Anne groans]
Why are these doors
so high up?

08:48.653 --> 08:51.114
[Polly yells]
Your big toe is in my eyeball!

08:51.114 --> 08:52.449
[Hop Pop] Watch it! My hand!

08:52.449 --> 08:54.617
[Polly] Get off of my...
[Hop Pop] Stay quiet.

08:54.617 --> 08:56.077
[phone vibrates]

08:56.161 --> 08:57.620
[sighs]

08:57.620 --> 09:00.331
Okay. So your mother and I
have a plan to get you out.

09:00.331 --> 09:02.792
‐It's really good too!
‐Guys, no!

09:02.792 --> 09:05.587
Seriously, we got this.
It's four on one.

09:05.670 --> 09:08.423
When he comes in,
we'll rush him and run.
See you soon.

09:08.506 --> 09:10.091
Man, this city, I tell ya.

09:10.091 --> 09:13.219
No, no, no, no, no.
Anne. Anne!

09:13.219 --> 09:17.557
[police sirens wailing]

09:22.228 --> 09:24.647
They're in the bathroom.
You ready, honey?

09:24.731 --> 09:25.857
Born ready.

09:30.528 --> 09:32.322
They're in there.
Come on, everyone.

09:32.322 --> 09:33.656
Show time!

09:33.656 --> 09:38.161
Let's grab ourselves
some frog aliens.

09:40.580 --> 09:43.041
Okay, guys.
On three, go for the eyes.

09:43.041 --> 09:45.251
One, two...

09:45.251 --> 09:46.920
‐[SWAT guy] What's going on?
‐[SWAT guy 2] The power's off!

09:46.920 --> 09:49.089
‐[SWAT guy 3] On your toes!
‐[SWAT guy 4]
They're getting away!

09:49.089 --> 09:51.007
[SWAT guy]
Watch where you're stepping!

09:54.677 --> 09:57.097
[both croaking]

09:57.097 --> 09:59.432
[frogs continue croaking]

09:59.516 --> 10:03.103
[laughs]
Nice frog alien, sir.

10:03.103 --> 10:06.147
I've heard of
little green men,
but this is ridiculous.

10:07.232 --> 10:08.650
Looks like our little friends

10:08.650 --> 10:10.276
are smarter than I thought.

10:10.401 --> 10:12.320
We're gonna have fun
with this one, Jenny.

10:12.320 --> 10:15.115
And we'll have the last laugh!

10:18.576 --> 10:21.121
I don't believe it.
Dad, Mom, how did you...

10:21.121 --> 10:24.249
Well, parents have
a special set of skills.

10:24.374 --> 10:26.417
First, your mother
bought us some time...

10:31.506 --> 10:32.423
[meows]

10:32.549 --> 10:34.592
Wow.

10:34.717 --> 10:37.929
While your father
got the frogs at a pet store
down the street.

10:38.054 --> 10:42.225
The owner was
your T‐ball coach, Mr. Tran.
Remember him? Nice guy.

10:43.393 --> 10:44.811
[Mom]
And remember that one time

10:44.894 --> 10:46.604
we tried to fix
the electricity?

10:46.604 --> 10:48.481
[Anne] Yeah.
Wasn't that a disaster?

10:48.481 --> 10:51.401
[Dad] Yep. So we knew exactly
what not to do.

10:52.318 --> 10:54.112
[sirens wailing]

10:54.237 --> 10:55.655
‐Whoa.
‐Amazing.

10:55.780 --> 10:57.448
What is T‐ball, anyway?

10:57.574 --> 10:59.784
You guys seriously did all that?

10:59.909 --> 11:02.704
I can't believe it.
I guess I... I...

11:02.704 --> 11:04.706
[distorted voice]
...misjudged you.

11:04.706 --> 11:07.041
That's okay, sweetie.
We forgive you.

11:07.041 --> 11:09.669
Wait.
But how did you know which
bathroom we were hiding in?

11:09.669 --> 11:12.839
Uh...
Parental intuition?

11:12.922 --> 11:16.676
And maybe the tracking device
we put on Hop Pop
when he was sleeping.

11:17.594 --> 11:19.846
I was wondering
what that was.

11:19.846 --> 11:20.847
What?

11:20.930 --> 11:23.558
Hi‐yah!
[yelling]

11:24.726 --> 11:27.562
[frogs croaking]

11:32.984 --> 11:34.027
Hmm.

11:34.152 --> 11:36.696
I give Dante's Inferno
a B‐plus for story

11:36.696 --> 11:40.074
and an F‐minus
for helping us get home.
How's it goin' on your end...

11:40.074 --> 11:41.409
‐Sprig?
‐Pretty good.

11:41.492 --> 11:43.494
I think
I'm really gettin' somewhere.

11:44.495 --> 11:45.747
It's a giraffe.

11:45.747 --> 11:48.917
Okay. I can see
we need a break.
Finger football?

11:48.917 --> 11:50.210
You know it.

11:50.293 --> 11:51.794
[whistle blows]

11:52.962 --> 11:54.214
Score!

11:54.297 --> 11:55.798
[Sprig laughing]

11:57.634 --> 11:59.510
Hey. What's gotten
into you two?

11:59.510 --> 12:00.929
Oh, nothing.

12:00.929 --> 12:03.765
We're just looking
for a place to put
this mud crown!

12:05.516 --> 12:07.769
