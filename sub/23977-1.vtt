WEBVTT

00:36.297 --> 00:37.130
- Abacus?

01:10.319 --> 01:11.152
- Your--

01:11.152 --> 01:11.985
- Shh, shh, shh.

01:11.985 --> 01:13.400
You're okay.

01:13.400 --> 01:14.370
Okay, shh, shh, shh, now.

01:14.370 --> 01:15.270
Take your time.

01:15.270 --> 01:16.153
Take your time.

01:16.153 --> 01:17.852
You got all the time in the--

01:17.852 --> 01:19.330
You got something to say, say it.

01:19.330 --> 01:22.970
- Your penis is hanging out.

01:22.970 --> 01:24.190
- Oh.

01:24.190 --> 01:25.023
Is he?

01:25.023 --> 01:26.170
Is he really?

01:26.170 --> 01:27.150
Ah, he is.

01:27.150 --> 01:27.983
Oh, god.

01:29.570 --> 01:31.520
I'm mortified right now.

01:31.520 --> 01:34.360
I'm test-driving a zip fly,

01:34.360 --> 01:36.550
and it's taking some
getting used to, buddy.

01:36.550 --> 01:37.830
- Maybe put it away?

01:37.830 --> 01:38.673
- Oh, yeah.

01:39.548 --> 01:41.088
What's the point in keeping it out?

01:42.160 --> 01:44.280
Yeah, we just met, yeah?

01:44.280 --> 01:46.045
Let me get him back.

01:46.045 --> 01:49.200
Yeah, I've known guys 10
years haven't seen my johnson.

01:49.200 --> 01:50.503
- This was my meet.

01:51.610 --> 01:55.240
Gringori was my asset, Logan.

01:55.240 --> 01:57.490
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, you know my name?

01:57.490 --> 01:58.710
You know me?

01:58.710 --> 02:02.200
- I sit four desks away from you.

02:02.200 --> 02:04.260
- What, at the office?

02:04.260 --> 02:05.427
Agent 40, 43?

02:07.191 --> 02:08.024
44?

02:08.024 --> 02:08.982
- 49.

02:08.982 --> 02:10.010
- What?!

02:10.010 --> 02:11.400
That's crazy.

02:11.400 --> 02:13.245
Give me a second, bro.

02:14.860 --> 02:15.820
We got Huxley?

02:15.820 --> 02:17.290
We got Huxley in?

02:17.290 --> 02:18.123
Huxley?

02:19.630 --> 02:23.940
So, this is a aftermath of a siege.

02:23.940 --> 02:26.320
This is Agent 49.

02:26.320 --> 02:27.500
He's dying.

02:27.500 --> 02:28.333
This is Huxley.

02:28.333 --> 02:31.050
He is doing some work experience
with us during the summer.

02:31.050 --> 02:32.048
- Are you for real?

02:33.756 --> 02:35.370
- It's a new government scheme.

02:35.370 --> 02:37.780
It's something I'm pretty
proud to be a part of.

02:37.780 --> 02:39.870
You know, bringing through
the next generation.

02:39.870 --> 02:41.250
- Is that guy gonna die?

02:41.250 --> 02:44.245
- Yeah, he's definitely, he's
most certainly gonna die.

02:44.245 --> 02:45.412
- Find Abacus.

02:49.930 --> 02:50.763
- Abacus?

02:50.763 --> 02:51.789
Did he...

02:51.789 --> 02:53.047
What could that mean?

02:53.047 --> 02:53.964
- Ah, heck.

02:58.233 --> 02:59.173
He's dead.

03:00.390 --> 03:01.773
He's dead as a daddy dodo.

03:03.550 --> 03:04.970
Yeah!

03:04.970 --> 03:05.803
He's a nice guy.

03:05.803 --> 03:07.090
I liked him.

03:07.090 --> 03:09.800
He could do 500 press-ups
on a couple of coconuts.

03:09.800 --> 03:10.633
- Yeah.

03:10.633 --> 03:12.420
Good kisser, and all.

03:12.420 --> 03:13.510
Strong tongue.

03:13.510 --> 03:16.040
- Yeah, he sounds like
one hell of a human being.

03:16.040 --> 03:21.040
Okay, let's roll this
out, Action Team style.

03:42.201 --> 03:44.437
- Ma'am, we have a Skype friend request

03:44.437 --> 03:46.030
from a Vlad Schev 69.

03:46.030 --> 03:47.560
- Ah. Thank you, Anne.

03:47.560 --> 03:49.880
Must be Vladimir Shevchenko of Oliviak,

03:49.880 --> 03:51.775
rogue republic of Russia.

03:51.775 --> 03:53.120
I didn't know he was still active.

03:53.120 --> 03:54.940
- Shall I accept it and trace the source?

03:54.940 --> 03:55.773
- Yes.

03:55.773 --> 03:57.193
I was just about to say that.

03:58.870 --> 04:01.547
Accept it and trace the source.

04:07.487 --> 04:10.905
- Well, well, well.

04:10.905 --> 04:13.220
What do we have here?

04:13.220 --> 04:17.720
Cowardly custards of MI6.

04:17.720 --> 04:18.553
Hello.

04:18.553 --> 04:20.410
- Yes, this is MI6, Ruth Brooks.

04:20.410 --> 04:21.630
How may I help?

04:21.630 --> 04:24.730
- I have some pretty sick shit

04:24.730 --> 04:27.730
lined up for you buttholes in the West.

04:27.730 --> 04:29.434
- Oh, really, and what's that?

04:29.434 --> 04:30.612
- Abacus.

04:30.612 --> 04:33.780
Abacus, Abacus, Abacus, Abacus.

04:33.780 --> 04:35.008
- Abacus is a myth.

04:35.008 --> 04:38.633
- Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.

04:39.480 --> 04:43.020
Or maybe it's completely
just a false flag.

04:43.020 --> 04:45.320
- That isn't what false flag means.

04:45.320 --> 04:46.153
- Isn't it?

04:46.153 --> 04:47.760
- A false flag would be
if we planned something

04:47.760 --> 04:49.550
to make it seem like you
did something terrible

04:49.550 --> 04:51.150
to frighten our own citizens.

04:51.150 --> 04:52.950
- Oh, you've picked up completely

04:52.950 --> 04:54.160
the wrong end of the stick.

04:54.160 --> 04:55.350
You fool!

04:55.350 --> 04:56.850
Well, that's actually a lot cooler

04:56.850 --> 04:59.260
than what we thought it
was in the first place.

04:59.260 --> 05:03.160
So maybe it is that.

05:03.160 --> 05:07.470
Suck my dick, United Kingdom,

05:07.470 --> 05:10.721
North America's favorite bitch.

05:12.378 --> 05:13.211
- That was good.

05:13.211 --> 05:14.770
- That last bit really felt good.

05:14.770 --> 05:16.170
I mean, it--
- Oh, yeah, and it was--

05:16.170 --> 05:17.043
- Yes, brilliant, right?

05:17.043 --> 05:18.960
- Yeah.
- What bit wasn't so good,

05:18.960 --> 05:20.000
you think, Sergei?

05:20.000 --> 05:21.986
What bit did we lose them on?

05:21.986 --> 05:23.370
- No, I'm sorry.
- Hm, no, no, no, no, no.

05:23.370 --> 05:25.619
Whisper, what bit was it?

05:25.619 --> 05:26.760
- False flag.

05:26.760 --> 05:28.420
- False flag bit.

05:28.420 --> 05:30.690
The one bit I gave you to look after.

05:30.690 --> 05:33.243
- Mr. Shevchenko,
you haven't hung up.

05:33.243 --> 05:34.660
- What?
- You do End Call.

05:34.660 --> 05:36.190
- What? Right.

05:36.190 --> 05:37.023
I'm sorry.

05:37.023 --> 05:38.110
This is an new laptop.

05:38.110 --> 05:40.830
We're just trying to
get the bugbears of it.

05:40.830 --> 05:42.850
- What have you done?
- Buddy, I thought that it's,

05:42.850 --> 05:44.121
what do I press?

05:44.121 --> 05:47.054
I don't--
- I think it's circle button

05:47.054 --> 05:49.379
with camera on it.

05:49.379 --> 05:50.690
I think.
- Can you still see?

05:50.690 --> 05:52.700
- Just put the lid down.

05:52.700 --> 05:54.638
- Just put the lid down.

05:54.638 --> 05:56.429
Sorry.

05:56.429 --> 05:57.262
- You should be.

05:57.262 --> 05:58.240
- Is new laptop.

05:58.240 --> 06:00.220
- Well, I shall burn your
mother's village down.

06:00.220 --> 06:02.043
- Oh, surely, I didn't know.

06:07.344 --> 06:09.360
- What the hell were you doing in Morocco?

06:09.360 --> 06:11.070
You weren't even supposed to be there.

06:11.070 --> 06:12.480
- Right, now before you say anything,

06:12.480 --> 06:14.170
you can't make me wear underpants.

06:14.170 --> 06:15.330
- What are you talking about?

06:15.330 --> 06:18.770
- Yesterday, on the mission,
where Mr. John flopped out.

06:18.770 --> 06:20.480
Embarrassed by...

06:20.480 --> 06:21.730
Was there something else on your mind?

06:21.730 --> 06:24.390
- Yes, Agent 49 is dead.

06:24.390 --> 06:26.380
He was one of my best agents.

06:26.380 --> 06:27.709
- What, best at being dead?

06:27.709 --> 06:29.402
- Just shut up.

06:29.402 --> 06:31.077
You're a liability, and I'm sick of it.

06:31.077 --> 06:32.320
Oh, really?

06:32.320 --> 06:35.610
Would a liability be able to
pull this from his pocket?

06:35.610 --> 06:37.160
A dongle.

06:37.160 --> 06:38.250
I found it on 49

06:38.250 --> 06:40.000
before he bought it.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.469
Oh, that just--
- Great.

06:41.469 --> 06:42.330
- Sorry.
- Brilliant.

06:42.330 --> 06:43.470
- I got it. I got it.

06:43.470 --> 06:44.900
- Oh, god.
- It's difficult

06:44.900 --> 06:46.210
to get a grip on it.

06:46.210 --> 06:47.660
- Look at your fingers, they're huge.

06:47.660 --> 06:48.620
- Just help me with the glass.

06:48.620 --> 06:49.857
Get it off my fingers, please.

06:49.857 --> 06:50.700
- Stuck.

06:50.700 --> 06:51.733
- Ah. That's it.

06:51.733 --> 06:52.566
Yep.

06:54.610 --> 06:55.503
- Right.

06:57.082 --> 06:58.070
What's on this?

06:58.070 --> 07:00.530
- Details for an attack on
the National Theater, Vienna,

07:00.530 --> 07:02.710
where this year's World Peace Convention

07:02.710 --> 07:04.920
of Good Day is taking place.

07:04.920 --> 07:07.717
We fear Abacus may strike.

07:07.717 --> 07:09.350
- "What, you're joking."

07:09.350 --> 07:10.670
No, I'm being serious, Ruth.

07:10.670 --> 07:11.927
I worked this out on my own.

07:11.927 --> 07:13.077
"You're the best, Logan.

07:13.077 --> 07:14.410
"I don't know what I'd do without you."

07:14.410 --> 07:17.760
Oh, you'd be okay, but the
world would be destroyed.

07:17.760 --> 07:20.120
- Right, well, that's interesting.

07:20.120 --> 07:22.780
We had a direct threat
from Vladimir Shevchenko,

07:22.780 --> 07:24.940
name-checking Abacus, this morning.

07:24.940 --> 07:25.950
- Clever.

07:25.950 --> 07:27.647
I look forward to taking him down.

07:27.647 --> 07:30.360
- No, no, Logan, you won't
be taking anybody down.

07:30.360 --> 07:32.540
You'll be going to Vienna
as eyes and ears only,

07:32.540 --> 07:34.390
and you'll leave the
rest to the Austrians.

07:34.390 --> 07:37.163
- What the hell are the
Austrians getting involved for?

07:39.370 --> 07:40.870
- Because Vienna's in Austria.

07:42.793 --> 07:43.979
- Oh, yeah. Mm.

07:50.356 --> 07:52.600
You got anything, G-Whiz?

07:52.600 --> 07:54.163
- Hell, yeah, Logi Bear.

07:55.200 --> 07:57.890
I've noticed a lot more
people dress their dogs here.

07:57.890 --> 07:59.920
I've seen three or four
with little vests on,

07:59.920 --> 08:01.160
mainly smaller breeds,

08:01.160 --> 08:03.807
but I did see a Rottweiler in a hoodie.

08:03.807 --> 08:05.030
- Mm.

08:05.030 --> 08:07.014
Must be a European thing.

08:09.880 --> 08:11.300
- I'm on you.

08:11.300 --> 08:12.315
- Cover me.

08:12.315 --> 08:13.473
- Right behind you, boss.

08:21.430 --> 08:22.783
- Good morning, Mr. Logan.

08:23.910 --> 08:24.753
Action Team.

08:26.540 --> 08:27.900
Your superior, Ruth Brooks,

08:27.900 --> 08:30.240
has sent me to assist
you in your operation.

08:30.240 --> 08:33.200
I am Agent Bogohardt of the
Austrian Secret Service.

08:33.200 --> 08:35.090
- We don't need any help.

08:35.090 --> 08:36.190
We're fine on our own.

08:37.190 --> 08:39.060
- I have intel on a prime suspect

08:39.060 --> 08:40.350
that might be carrying Abacus.

08:40.350 --> 08:41.290
- Well, fuck me.

08:41.290 --> 08:42.360
Somebody pass me a wet wipe.

08:42.360 --> 08:43.990
All right?

08:43.990 --> 08:45.800
Monica Lang, head of explosives,

08:45.800 --> 08:48.310
mixed martial arts,
pretty much anything goes.

08:48.310 --> 08:49.143
Oh.

08:51.110 --> 08:52.990
Can you hear that?

08:52.990 --> 08:54.150
- No.

08:54.150 --> 08:54.983
- It's like a...

08:56.417 --> 09:00.123
It's like a galloping in me undercarriage.

09:02.416 --> 09:03.620
Oh, steady.

09:03.620 --> 09:05.957
Oh, more like a canter now.

09:07.357 --> 09:09.023
Oh, god.

09:09.023 --> 09:10.246
- Ah, hey, hey, hey.

09:10.246 --> 09:11.782
Hey, Mo, leave it.

09:11.782 --> 09:13.104
Leave it for now.

09:13.104 --> 09:14.590
Yeah, Mo, just chill out.

09:14.590 --> 09:16.297
- I don't feel bad.

09:18.100 --> 09:18.933
- Right.

09:19.780 --> 09:20.983
Now show us this intel.

09:23.890 --> 09:26.090
So, who's this butt-munch?

09:26.090 --> 09:29.440
- This is well-known bomb-maker
and terrorist Naslav Klone.

09:29.440 --> 09:30.350
- Wow.

09:30.350 --> 09:32.600
Such a Russian baddie name.

09:32.600 --> 09:34.890
- He's Ukrainian, actually.

09:34.890 --> 09:35.723
- Well, what's the difference?

09:35.723 --> 09:36.693
Same thing, potato, potato.

09:37.532 --> 09:38.720
- Well, one difference

09:38.720 --> 09:40.957
is that they are at war with each other.

09:41.890 --> 09:45.080
Klone is down to perform at
the main gala this evening.

09:45.080 --> 09:47.410
In attendance will be the patrons

09:47.410 --> 09:48.590
of the world's leading charities.

09:48.590 --> 09:51.925
We believe inside the
cello case is a dirty bomb.

09:54.180 --> 09:56.341
Abacus.

09:56.341 --> 09:58.920
The security will be incredibly tight.

09:58.920 --> 10:00.000
I believe we have to infiltrate, so--

10:00.000 --> 10:01.163
- Okay, can it.

10:02.010 --> 10:02.960
I got this, buster.

10:02.960 --> 10:04.530
It's my team.

10:04.530 --> 10:06.356
Right, here's how we're
gonna do this thing.

10:06.356 --> 10:09.233
Hux, you're going in,
undercover as a waiter.

10:11.070 --> 10:12.990
- I'm only here on work experience,

10:12.990 --> 10:14.496
so I don't think I'm ready to be a waiter.

10:14.496 --> 10:16.040
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
there's no "can't" here.

10:16.040 --> 10:16.943
You can do this.

10:18.170 --> 10:19.620
Graham, you're my eyes and ears.

10:19.620 --> 10:21.150
- As per.

10:21.150 --> 10:24.940
- Monica, you take Dork Vader
here down to the basement.

10:24.940 --> 10:26.660
Hack into the mainframe.

10:26.660 --> 10:29.251
Put one Logan Mann on
the gala's guest list.

10:30.930 --> 10:31.847
- Logan Mann?

10:31.847 --> 10:34.359
But are you not going in disguise?

10:41.370 --> 10:45.275
- It's called hiding in plain sight.

10:45.275 --> 10:49.397
But you wouldn't know a
thing about that, would you?

10:56.140 --> 10:57.903
The king is in the castle.

11:03.230 --> 11:04.063
What are you doing?

11:04.063 --> 11:06.690
Are you waving at me?

11:06.690 --> 11:08.400
What, you're waving and whistling.

11:08.400 --> 11:09.320
No. No.

11:09.320 --> 11:10.500
You got to be a waiter.

11:10.500 --> 11:11.628
Go to the ballroom.

11:11.628 --> 11:13.120
Go in the ballroom.

11:13.120 --> 11:15.320
Ballroom, okay?

11:15.320 --> 11:18.097
Let me know as soon as Klone gets there.

11:23.500 --> 11:25.750
- I have Klone in my sights.

11:25.750 --> 11:28.510
Pretty's got a few big,
suspicious suitcases with him,

11:28.510 --> 11:31.330
and he's flanked by some
rather tasty-looking toe rags.

11:31.330 --> 11:32.490
Over.

11:32.490 --> 11:33.453
- Roger that.

11:34.587 --> 11:35.420
Evening.

11:35.420 --> 11:36.690
- Can I take your name, please, sir?

11:36.690 --> 11:38.923
- Yeah, it's Mann, Logan Mann.

11:40.630 --> 11:41.770
- I'm sorry, sir.

11:41.770 --> 11:43.610
Your name is not on the list.

11:43.610 --> 11:45.633
- Would you mind checking one last time?

11:47.211 --> 11:51.889
- Ah, come on, you fucker.

11:51.889 --> 11:53.610
Boom.

11:53.610 --> 11:54.470
He's in.

11:54.470 --> 11:55.770
- Oh.

11:55.770 --> 11:56.773
Your name is here.

11:57.750 --> 11:59.470
I apologize, Mr. Mann.

11:59.470 --> 12:00.620
Please, have a good evening.

12:00.620 --> 12:01.570
- I intend to.

12:01.570 --> 12:02.803
Thank you, John.

12:06.370 --> 12:07.533
- Impressive.

12:11.560 --> 12:12.910
- Yeah?

12:12.910 --> 12:16.800
- So, what made you want
to become a secret agent?

12:16.800 --> 12:18.753
- Ooh, steady.

12:21.877 --> 12:23.380
Are you flirting with me?

12:23.380 --> 12:25.433
- No, I'm just making small talk.

12:27.170 --> 12:29.920
- No, I actually became a secret agent

12:29.920 --> 12:32.980
in revenge for what happened
to my parents, so yeah.

12:32.980 --> 12:33.813
- Oh.

12:35.430 --> 12:36.263
I'm sorry.

12:38.016 --> 12:39.560
Were they murdered?

12:39.560 --> 12:43.140
- No.

12:43.140 --> 12:44.583
No, they divorced.

12:48.090 --> 12:51.238
- I'm really, really sorry to hear that.

12:51.238 --> 12:52.155
- Oh, well.

12:53.344 --> 12:54.427
C'est la vie.

12:57.552 --> 13:01.353
It's funny, I've never
told anyone that before.

13:03.310 --> 13:08.310
I just feel like I can tell
you anything, you know?

13:11.243 --> 13:12.076
- Of course.

13:13.140 --> 13:15.007
You can tell me everything.

13:16.095 --> 13:17.115
- Yeah.

13:18.969 --> 13:20.052
Fucking hell.

13:24.219 --> 13:25.052
- Vlad?

13:26.085 --> 13:27.335
Hello, it's me.

13:28.730 --> 13:30.903
Abacus is now active.

13:32.030 --> 13:34.304
I will terminate them all.

13:37.840 --> 13:39.230
There you go.

13:39.230 --> 13:40.063
- Ah.

13:40.063 --> 13:41.440
Don't mind if I ding-dang-do.

13:41.440 --> 13:42.870
Thank you muchly.

13:42.870 --> 13:45.531
In Austria, we say .

13:45.531 --> 13:46.697
- Oh.

13:51.910 --> 13:52.793
By God.

13:53.870 --> 13:55.163
That is milky tea, sir.

13:56.890 --> 13:58.490
It's funny, foreign milk, innit?

13:59.660 --> 14:02.060
Can I just say, Bogohardt,
now that we're mates,

14:03.600 --> 14:06.790
don't take Logan's banter
too seriously, okay?

14:06.790 --> 14:08.870
I mean, they go on as
if I'm boring sometimes,

14:08.870 --> 14:11.160
and I just laugh me head off, you know,

14:11.160 --> 14:12.210
'cause I'm all right.

14:13.560 --> 14:17.780
All right, up here, in the nest.

14:17.780 --> 14:20.050
I got everything I need.

14:20.050 --> 14:23.810
I got my pencils, I got my snacks,

14:23.810 --> 14:25.840
and I can see what you've done now.

14:25.840 --> 14:27.003
You've poisoned me.

14:32.911 --> 14:33.744
- Logan.

14:33.744 --> 14:35.194
Logan, look.

14:35.194 --> 14:36.194
He's here.

14:36.194 --> 14:37.165
- Yep.
- Logan.

14:37.165 --> 14:38.630
- Yep, I can see him.

14:38.630 --> 14:39.760
I can see him.

14:39.760 --> 14:40.650
Yep, I know.

14:40.650 --> 14:42.380
Stop, stop pointing at him.

14:42.380 --> 14:43.844
You're gonna attract attention.

14:43.844 --> 14:44.677
- What?

14:45.910 --> 14:47.482
- Oh, great.

14:47.482 --> 14:49.090
He's noticed you.

14:49.090 --> 14:50.400
He's made you out.

14:50.400 --> 14:51.550
Kid, get out of here.

14:51.550 --> 14:52.920
- Why?
- Because a lunatic

14:52.920 --> 14:53.986
with a bomb.

14:53.986 --> 14:55.073
- No.

14:55.073 --> 14:55.998
- Yes.
- For real?

14:55.998 --> 14:57.130
A bomb?

14:57.130 --> 14:57.963
- Buddy, work with me here.

14:57.963 --> 14:59.350
- Oh, my gosh.
- Buddy, you were in the room

14:59.350 --> 15:02.530
with me when I was discussing the plan.

15:02.530 --> 15:04.460
- Bomb?
- Kid, get outta here.

15:04.460 --> 15:05.300
Get out.

15:05.300 --> 15:06.670
- I'm going, I'm going.

15:06.670 --> 15:08.868
- Threat is live.

15:13.048 --> 15:14.071
- Oh.

15:16.310 --> 15:17.870
- Okay, Klone.

15:17.870 --> 15:19.763
You want this the easy
way or the hard way?

15:55.422 --> 15:57.340
All right, chill out, everyone.

15:57.340 --> 15:59.233
I'm from MI6.

16:00.370 --> 16:04.220
These men are from an evil network.

16:04.220 --> 16:05.993
In that case is a dirty bomb.

16:08.980 --> 16:10.510
Open the case.

16:10.510 --> 16:11.440
Go on.

16:11.440 --> 16:12.273
Open it.

16:20.332 --> 16:23.020
Well, it is what looks like a cello.

16:23.020 --> 16:27.100
If it is a cello, play it.

16:27.100 --> 16:28.720
Play it, music man.

16:28.720 --> 16:30.550
Come on, pick it up. Play it.

16:30.550 --> 16:31.383
Play it.

16:39.603 --> 16:40.436
Wow, ooh.

16:42.380 --> 16:43.630
Holy shitballs.

16:44.799 --> 16:48.163
I did not expect to feel
like this right now.

16:49.050 --> 16:49.950
Beautiful sound.

16:49.950 --> 16:51.488
Stop it. Stop it.

16:51.488 --> 16:53.160
You've proved your point.

16:53.160 --> 16:54.100
Very well proved.

16:54.100 --> 16:56.343
And round of applause.

16:58.585 --> 16:59.860
What a performance.

16:59.860 --> 17:02.470
Anyone else here think they were bad guys?

17:02.470 --> 17:04.390
I mean, straight off the bat,

17:04.390 --> 17:08.340
who else would wear sunglasses inside?

17:08.340 --> 17:11.980
- We are the Cataract
Society String Quartet.

17:11.980 --> 17:14.830
- Yep, well, yeah, of
course, blind people.

17:14.830 --> 17:17.480
That would, well, that's a great answer.

17:17.480 --> 17:20.020
So, musician and a brain box.

17:20.020 --> 17:21.700
- Someone call security!

17:21.700 --> 17:23.080
- Oh, there's no need for that.

17:23.080 --> 17:24.773
It's a simple mistake.

17:31.045 --> 17:33.230
Graham, Monica, do you copy?

17:33.230 --> 17:34.090
Do you copy me?

17:34.090 --> 17:34.967
Do you copy?

17:34.967 --> 17:36.214
(taser crackling

17:38.893 --> 17:42.120
- Graham?

17:42.120 --> 17:43.320
Graham, can you hear me?

17:45.060 --> 17:45.893
Yeah.

17:48.350 --> 17:51.143
Okay, situation is
you've had a nasty fall,

17:52.040 --> 17:53.403
you can't feel your legs.

17:54.360 --> 17:56.083
you've soiled yourself,

17:57.090 --> 18:00.630
and you're probably gonna
die in a minute, I reckon.

18:00.630 --> 18:01.820
So, what we're gonna do is this:

18:01.820 --> 18:03.380
We're gonna turn ourselves over

18:04.500 --> 18:05.783
and, if I'm not mistaken,

18:07.020 --> 18:09.670
you should have some adrenaline
in your bum bag, son.

18:11.085 --> 18:11.918
Okay.

18:19.186 --> 18:20.371
Come on.

18:20.371 --> 18:21.204
Come on.

18:29.250 --> 18:30.300
Logan, Monica, do you copy?

18:30.300 --> 18:31.133
Over.

18:32.820 --> 18:34.091
Logan, Monica, do you copy?

18:34.091 --> 18:34.924
Over!

18:39.630 --> 18:43.810
- Bogohardt, or should I say Abacus?

18:43.810 --> 18:46.740
- Finally, he works it out.

18:46.740 --> 18:47.740
Idiots.

18:47.740 --> 18:49.311
I walked right into your midst,

18:49.311 --> 18:52.780
and, how do you call it, Mr. Logan,

18:52.780 --> 18:56.170
I'm hiding in plain sight?

18:56.170 --> 18:58.230
You know, it was really sad

18:58.230 --> 19:00.310
watching you chasing your own tail,

19:00.310 --> 19:01.923
like itchy-itchy-bum dog.

19:03.090 --> 19:05.110
But your plan is very bullshit.

19:05.110 --> 19:08.080
- Oh, and what about Klone?

19:08.080 --> 19:09.536
- Just a diversion.

19:09.536 --> 19:10.786
- I don't get it, though.

19:12.020 --> 19:15.030
You were the threat to the
convention this whole time?

19:15.030 --> 19:19.890
- Mr. Logan, you will never get it.

19:19.890 --> 19:23.790
And now you're going to die.

19:23.790 --> 19:24.648
- Logan.

19:24.648 --> 19:25.690
Logan.

19:25.690 --> 19:28.960
- Any last words, western pigs?

19:28.960 --> 19:30.400
- Yeah.

19:30.400 --> 19:31.723
I got something to say.

19:34.536 --> 19:36.640
You know your balls stink?

19:36.640 --> 19:37.738
- My what?

19:37.738 --> 19:42.230
- Yeah, you have severely
stinking bollocks, my friend.

19:42.230 --> 19:44.610
And, sitting where I am right now,

19:44.610 --> 19:46.470
it's getting in my grill, up my nose.

19:46.470 --> 19:48.579
I can taste your balls.

19:49.780 --> 19:50.773
- Seriously?

19:51.720 --> 19:55.543
For you, this is the last
thing you ever want to say?

19:56.400 --> 19:58.560
You're more pathetic than I thought.

19:58.560 --> 20:00.770
- Do not beat yourself
up about this, buster.

20:00.770 --> 20:03.386
I know a lot of guys with smelly balls.

20:03.386 --> 20:04.800
Here's what you need to do:

20:04.800 --> 20:06.760
Have yourself a bath or a shower,

20:06.760 --> 20:08.350
and then, when you're done,

20:08.350 --> 20:11.970
dry off your squiddles and
then sprinkle on a little talc.

20:11.970 --> 20:13.560
Get those talced up nice.

20:13.560 --> 20:14.446
- Just dust them down.

20:14.446 --> 20:16.393
- Yeah, dusting's good.
- Just shut up!

20:17.280 --> 20:19.240
You just try to make me feel bad

20:19.240 --> 20:22.290
because you made shitty,
shitty, bullshit plan,

20:22.290 --> 20:24.567
and not realize that I am Abacus!

20:24.567 --> 20:26.410
- You got me.

20:26.410 --> 20:28.740
My plan really did stink.

20:28.740 --> 20:31.250
But you know the only
thing that stinks worse?

20:31.250 --> 20:33.083
- What?
- Your gonads.

20:34.006 --> 20:35.160
Your balls, eh?

20:35.160 --> 20:36.040
Oh, wow.

20:36.040 --> 20:38.360
- I wash my balls, okay?!

20:38.360 --> 20:41.520
I wash and clean my balls
every morning before breakfast!

20:42.353 --> 20:43.480
I wash my balls, yeah?!

20:43.480 --> 20:44.313
There's nothing wrong,

20:44.313 --> 20:46.496
they don't stink!

20:49.660 --> 20:51.273
- Nice shooting, G-String.

20:52.166 --> 20:53.560
Nice shooting, indeed.

20:53.560 --> 20:55.846
- Ah, it's an absolute pleasure, mate.

20:59.152 --> 20:59.985
- Hello?

21:01.193 --> 21:03.470
Got Logan Mann, ma'am.

21:03.470 --> 21:05.202
- Thank you, Anne.

21:06.419 --> 21:08.569
What the hell is going on out there, Mann?

21:08.569 --> 21:11.140
- Threat neutralized, ma'am.

21:11.140 --> 21:12.334
Abacus is down.

21:13.360 --> 21:14.620
- Well done, team.

21:14.620 --> 21:15.453
Great.

21:16.760 --> 21:19.430
- That's Mr. Shevchenko on line two.

21:19.430 --> 21:20.653
- Fine. Put him through.

21:22.550 --> 21:24.680
Yes, Mr. Shevchenko, what
can we do for you now?

21:24.680 --> 21:26.170
- Hello, everyone.

21:26.170 --> 21:27.460
Is everyone there?

21:27.460 --> 21:28.660
Can you hear me?

21:28.660 --> 21:31.043
- Yes, we can hear you.
- Yeah, I can hear you.

21:31.043 --> 21:35.890
- That's right, you gas-buying bitches.

21:35.890 --> 21:39.067
Bogohardt is Abacus.

21:39.067 --> 21:40.970
- Abacus is down.

21:40.970 --> 21:42.057
He's dead.

21:44.840 --> 21:46.617
- You fool.

21:46.617 --> 21:48.450
You stupid fool.

21:49.630 --> 21:54.630
Abacus is not one man, it's many men.

21:55.910 --> 21:58.299
Abacus is everywhere.

21:58.299 --> 22:03.299
Everywhere, everywhere,
everywhere, everywhere.

22:03.695 --> 22:07.910
It's a good view from up there,
wouldn't you say, Mr. Mann?

22:07.910 --> 22:08.743
- It's all right.

22:08.743 --> 22:10.320
It's not the best view I've ever seen,

22:10.320 --> 22:11.660
but it's perfectly adequate.

22:11.660 --> 22:12.639
It's quite a nice view--

22:17.335 --> 22:18.783
Oh, god.

22:18.783 --> 22:21.629
- That's me, bullshit Mann!

22:21.629 --> 22:25.427
It was a double, double,
double, double bluff!

22:25.427 --> 22:27.660
Slam dunk in your face.

22:27.660 --> 22:30.790
See, the real fun, it begins now,

22:30.790 --> 22:33.750
and my next move will be more insane

22:33.750 --> 22:38.410
and more scary than this one even was.

22:38.410 --> 22:39.243
Goodnight.

22:40.737 --> 22:42.610
- Well, I think you know

22:42.610 --> 22:44.200
what we're dealing with here, ma'am.

22:44.200 --> 22:45.033
- Yes.

22:49.136 --> 22:50.803
- What's going on, Logi Bear?

22:50.803 --> 22:55.160
- Some sick maniac has
just blown up a building

22:55.160 --> 22:58.643
for no good reason but to show off.

22:59.630 --> 23:01.930
- But didn't we do that
last week in Morocco?

23:01.930 --> 23:04.070
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

23:04.070 --> 23:05.330
That's a completely different explo--

23:05.330 --> 23:06.163
- Why?

23:07.432 --> 23:08.573
- It just is.
- We did the exact same thing.

23:08.573 --> 23:10.560
- No, it's not, it really isn't.

23:10.560 --> 23:12.118
You just don't know what's going on.

23:12.118 --> 23:14.360
- But I remember, in Morocco,
we did the exact same thing.

23:14.360 --> 23:15.990
- That's irrelevant, it really is.

23:15.990 --> 23:18.320
You're a, inquisitive mind, I like that.

23:18.320 --> 23:20.209
But keep it to yourself, it's--

23:20.209 --> 23:21.810
- Graham, mate, you shat yourself?

23:21.810 --> 23:23.643
- That is affirmative.

23:24.547 --> 23:25.824
- Whew.

23:25.824 --> 23:26.657
Mate, that's strong.

23:26.657 --> 23:27.536
- I know.

23:29.363 --> 23:30.823
It's in my shoes.

23:36.480 --> 23:37.610
- Ma'am?

23:37.610 --> 23:38.573
- Yes, Anne?

23:40.515 --> 23:43.959
- Do you fancy maybe grabbing a drink?

23:43.959 --> 23:44.792
- No.

23:46.861 --> 23:48.537
- Yes, of course, ma'am.

23:48.537 --> 23:49.537
- Goodnight.
