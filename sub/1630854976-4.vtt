WEBVTT

00:07.383 --> 00:08.551
So the Internet is currently
burning with theories

00:08.551 --> 00:10.511
about who went Hannibal Lecter
on Ni'Jah.

00:10.511 --> 00:12.888
Becky with the big teeth
finna get stung.

00:12.888 --> 00:14.724
You mess with Ni'Jah,
you mess with the whole swarm.

00:14.724 --> 00:16.183
- Ni'Jah.
- Ni'Jah.

00:16.183 --> 00:18.853
...bitch would even think
about touching Ni'Jah?

00:18.853 --> 00:20.688
Whoever did Ni'Jah,
your mom's a ho.

00:20.688 --> 00:23.399
Get that motherfucker
Robert Mueller on the phone.

00:23.399 --> 00:25.860
Do something useful
with your special counsel.

01:16.702 --> 01:17.828
License.

01:21.791 --> 01:23.667
One second.

01:37.640 --> 01:40.059
Whose car is this?

01:40.059 --> 01:42.311
It's my mother's car.

01:54.031 --> 01:56.075
Tint's a little high
on these windows.

01:56.075 --> 01:58.327
She's gonna need
to get that fixed.

02:00.538 --> 02:02.331
You're a long way from Texas.

02:02.331 --> 02:05.334
Gotta be a long drive.

02:05.334 --> 02:07.044
Yeah.

02:08.546 --> 02:11.382
I'm guessing you're in town
for the music festival.

02:11.382 --> 02:14.552
Oh, yes.
I-I gotta get to Ni'Jah.

02:14.552 --> 02:18.514
Yeah, a lot of folks in town
for Bonnaroo.

02:18.514 --> 02:20.474
You know where you're going?

02:21.642 --> 02:23.185
Yep, just to motel.

02:23.185 --> 02:25.855
So where you staying?
Fairbanks Hotel?

02:26.897 --> 02:29.316
Mm-hmm.

02:29.316 --> 02:32.444
See, I meant the Fairview Hotel.

02:33.946 --> 02:35.447
I always mess that up.

02:35.447 --> 02:38.367
Oh, yeah,
that's the one.

02:38.367 --> 02:39.660
Mm-hmm.

02:40.870 --> 02:44.665
- That's a pretty nice place.
- Mm-hmm.

02:47.001 --> 02:49.503
Well, I'm gonna follow
behind you,

02:49.503 --> 02:51.714
make sure you get there
in one piece.

04:49.999 --> 04:51.417
I got rid of him for you.

04:51.417 --> 04:53.460
What'd you say?

04:53.460 --> 04:57.006
I told him he was harassing
a young Black woman.

04:57.006 --> 04:58.674
I have a lot
of Instagram followers,

04:58.674 --> 05:00.801
so I just said I'd post him
on social media.

05:00.801 --> 05:03.637
Is this your first time
at Bonnaroo?

05:05.264 --> 05:06.807
How do you know that?

05:06.807 --> 05:08.517
You're young.

05:08.517 --> 05:10.102
You're not dressed
like a veteran.

05:10.102 --> 05:12.855
- Are you staying at a hotel?
- Nope.

05:12.855 --> 05:15.733
Think I'm just gonna...
I don't know,

05:15.733 --> 05:17.693
guess I'm gon' sleep
in my car this week.

05:17.693 --> 05:20.029
What? No, don't say...

05:20.029 --> 05:22.906
Our place is nearby
and it's huge.

05:22.906 --> 05:25.743
As a former couch surfer myself,
I gotta pay it forward.

05:28.662 --> 05:30.330
- I'm good.
- Come on.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.708
It's your first time
at Bonnaroo.

05:32.708 --> 05:35.127
I know you didn't imagine
sleeping in your car was gonna

05:35.127 --> 05:37.463
be your first experience here, right?

05:38.505 --> 05:39.923
Look, I'm not a creep.

05:39.923 --> 05:42.176
It's just me and some friends.

05:42.176 --> 05:44.303
And you look like
you could use some.

05:44.303 --> 05:46.138
I'm Cricket, by the way.

05:47.765 --> 05:49.558
Okay.

05:54.271 --> 05:57.149
I loved talking to you.

06:08.410 --> 06:10.954
Hey.

06:13.290 --> 06:16.835
H-How far is your place
from the festival?

06:59.211 --> 07:01.296
- Hi.
- You guys are back.

07:01.296 --> 07:03.006
We made
a new friend in town.

07:03.006 --> 07:04.716
Fantastic.

07:04.716 --> 07:07.928
Salem, do you mind putting
the chairs away for me?

07:07.928 --> 07:10.180
- Sure.
- Let me grab those for you.

07:10.180 --> 07:11.849
Got it.

07:13.517 --> 07:17.521
Hi. I'm Eva.

07:17.521 --> 07:19.314
Welcome.

07:26.405 --> 07:28.407
You live here?

07:28.407 --> 07:32.286
No. Um, not full-time, anyway.

07:32.286 --> 07:34.496
A friend is letting us
stay here.

07:34.496 --> 07:38.000
My sister actually
designed the place.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.962
Being here is the best reset.

07:41.962 --> 07:44.423
Our minds and our bodies,

07:44.423 --> 07:48.886
they get so out of whack
living in dense cities.

07:48.886 --> 07:52.639
- What's your name?
- Kayla.

07:52.639 --> 07:56.768
That's a beautiful name.
How do you spell it?

07:56.768 --> 07:59.021
With a "K."

07:59.021 --> 08:01.148
And a "A," and a "Y,"

08:01.148 --> 08:05.027
and a "L," and
another "A," too. Kayla.

08:05.027 --> 08:07.446
No wonder I feel
so drawn to you.

08:07.446 --> 08:10.574
What that mean?

08:10.574 --> 08:14.203
Kayla, Eva end in "A."

08:14.203 --> 08:17.581
Familiar names
create this bias that

08:17.581 --> 08:20.709
essentially binds people together.

08:20.709 --> 08:24.671
All my life I've had
this intense connection

08:24.671 --> 08:27.424
to people with names like

08:27.424 --> 08:31.553
Ella, Kayla, Clarissa...

08:31.553 --> 08:34.306
Marissa?

08:34.306 --> 08:36.308
Exactly.

08:42.314 --> 08:45.400
Ooh, it smells great in here.

08:45.400 --> 08:48.403
- Oh, you want some tea?
- No.

08:48.403 --> 08:50.948
Janine, would you...
Would you make a pot of water?

08:50.948 --> 08:52.532
Thank you so much.

08:52.532 --> 08:57.120
Hey, everyone, this is Kayla.

08:57.120 --> 08:59.665
Oh, my God, you are gorgeous.

08:59.665 --> 09:02.084
- Hi, Kayla.
- Yeah, I love your dress.

09:02.084 --> 09:05.462
She's uh, coming to
the festival, too.

09:05.462 --> 09:08.048
And I can already tell
she has a great aura,

09:08.048 --> 09:10.801
so let's make sure
she feels welcome.

09:10.801 --> 09:15.389
Kayla, this is Grace,
Audrey, and obviously

09:15.389 --> 09:16.807
you know Cricket.

09:16.807 --> 09:20.310
Um, this is Janine.
Hey, where's Isis?

09:20.310 --> 09:22.020
She's in the sauna.

09:22.020 --> 09:24.606
You hungry?
I made some flatbread.

09:24.606 --> 09:26.858
Oh, and we have pie
for dessert.

09:26.858 --> 09:29.486
- Yes.
<i>- So, Kayla,</i>

09:29.486 --> 09:31.613
did you get your concert
wristbands in the mail,

09:31.613 --> 09:33.198
or did you need to go
pick them up?

09:33.198 --> 09:36.326
Oh, I was gonna go early
and, um,

09:36.326 --> 09:37.744
sneak in through the west gate.

09:37.744 --> 09:40.038
People online said
they do it every year.

09:40.038 --> 09:42.082
Oh, I'm sorry,
that's the plan?

09:42.082 --> 09:44.501
- I guess.
- No.

09:44.501 --> 09:45.961
No, no, no, that's...

09:45.961 --> 09:48.380
The security is crazy
at this festival.

09:48.380 --> 09:50.382
Yeah, but all the tickets
are sold out.

09:50.382 --> 09:52.092
Cricket will handle it.

09:52.092 --> 09:55.137
Uh, a few of our friends
are performing, so...

09:55.137 --> 09:57.264
Yeah, I'm sure we could get you
an artist pass, right?

09:57.264 --> 09:58.307
Mm-hmm.

09:58.307 --> 10:01.059
Really?

10:01.059 --> 10:03.145
Do I have to pay you?

10:03.145 --> 10:05.355
No.

10:05.355 --> 10:08.692
You're part of the tribe now.
We got you.

10:08.692 --> 10:10.444
Total backstage access.

10:10.444 --> 10:13.613
Well, that's great.

10:13.613 --> 10:16.325
But I cannot miss Ni'Jah, okay?

10:16.325 --> 10:18.368
- Okay.
- I can, I cannot miss her.

10:18.368 --> 10:20.454
She's closing Saturday night,
and it's...

10:20.454 --> 10:22.122
and it's gonna be big.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.498
I know it.

10:23.498 --> 10:26.418
It's gonna be the biggest
moment of our lives.

10:27.461 --> 10:29.880
I'm actually friends with her.

10:29.880 --> 10:33.425
Yeah, but we got
into a little bit of a, um,

10:33.425 --> 10:35.802
a misunderstanding
the last time I saw her.

10:35.802 --> 10:38.347
Oh, no.
I'm sorry. That's terrible.

10:38.347 --> 10:41.016
- Is everything gonna be okay?
- Oh, it's-it's fine.

10:41.016 --> 10:42.976
She still loves me.

10:42.976 --> 10:45.270
It's just, I have to apologize.

10:45.270 --> 10:48.774
And then, after the show,
we'll probably hang out

10:48.774 --> 10:51.234
with, like, her kids
and everything.

10:51.234 --> 10:53.487
Oh, my God, I love Ni'Jah.

10:53.487 --> 10:55.614
- She's such a goddess.
- Oh, she is.

10:55.614 --> 10:58.241
I don't know, I kind of
like her sister better.

10:58.241 --> 11:01.453
She seems more, like,
you know, spiritual.

11:01.453 --> 11:03.163
She's all right.

11:03.163 --> 11:06.249
Ni'Jah is a goddess, but...

11:06.249 --> 11:07.918
so are you.

11:07.918 --> 11:09.586
Remember that.

11:09.586 --> 11:11.254
Remember to speak
with intention,

11:11.254 --> 11:13.924
and I know you will
work it all out.

11:16.259 --> 11:17.594
Look who finally joined us.

11:17.594 --> 11:19.221
Hey, guys, sorry I'm late.

11:21.681 --> 11:23.475
Something smells delicious.

11:23.475 --> 11:24.726
Thank you.
Want anything?

11:24.726 --> 11:27.229
No, thank you.
I'm still fasting.

11:27.229 --> 11:30.440
My E.U. with Lela was
fucking incredible.

11:30.440 --> 11:33.235
I mean, I was weeping.
Like, weeping.

11:33.235 --> 11:35.487
- Oh...
- It's a good weep.

11:35.487 --> 11:38.115
- Mmm.
- Uh, what is a E.U.?

11:38.115 --> 11:40.575
Evolution to Understanding.
You should try it sometime.

11:40.575 --> 11:43.453
Yeah, it's like meditation
on crack.

11:43.453 --> 11:44.454
You do crack?

11:46.415 --> 11:48.708
You're funny.

11:48.708 --> 11:51.086
Amazing.

11:51.086 --> 11:55.298
And sorry for all the stairs,
but you'll get used to it.

11:56.341 --> 11:58.427
Here is the room.

11:58.427 --> 12:01.805
Pick a bed, any bed.

12:04.474 --> 12:06.601
Am I the only one
in this room?

12:06.601 --> 12:08.812
Yeah.

12:08.812 --> 12:11.356
I feel like this is
your bed, though.

12:11.356 --> 12:14.192
- Why?
- It looks like you.

12:14.192 --> 12:16.153
You can leave your clothes
in the bathroom

12:16.153 --> 12:17.404
for me to wash.

12:17.404 --> 12:18.613
I've already got
some loads going.

12:18.613 --> 12:20.949
Yeah, well, I can wash
my own clothes.

12:20.949 --> 12:23.577
All right, well, shout
if you need anything.

12:23.577 --> 12:25.912
I'm just down the hall,

12:25.912 --> 12:27.164
and if the music gets
too loud,

12:27.164 --> 12:28.707
feel free to close the doors.

12:28.707 --> 12:30.625
Cricket actually
designed this place

12:30.625 --> 12:32.836
pretty well, acoustically.

12:34.212 --> 12:36.006
- Cricket designed this?
- Yeah.

12:36.006 --> 12:37.674
Badass, right?

12:37.674 --> 12:41.511
I thought Eva said
it was her sister.

12:41.511 --> 12:46.516
Sort of.
Like a... sorority sister.

12:49.019 --> 12:52.731
<i>♪ Say my name, say my name ♪</i>

12:52.731 --> 12:56.693
<i>♪ Yeah, say my name,
say my name ♪</i>

12:56.693 --> 12:58.987
<i>♪ Ho, say my name ♪</i>

12:58.987 --> 13:01.615
<i>Dre,
if there's anyone crazy enough</i>

13:01.615 --> 13:04.534
<i>to meet Ni'Jah Hutton,
it's you.</i>

13:05.577 --> 13:06.786
Hey.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.955
Didn't mean to spook you.

13:08.955 --> 13:11.541
We're all going on a hike.
I thought you should come.

13:11.541 --> 13:14.503
- At night?
- It's the morning.

13:14.503 --> 13:16.963
But it's still black outside.

13:19.007 --> 13:20.967
Come on.

13:20.967 --> 13:23.970
You think Ni'Jah lays
in bed all day?

13:23.970 --> 13:26.056
You think she stays in bed and
learns all those dance moves?

13:26.056 --> 13:29.434
No. But that's because
Ni'Jah is special.

13:29.434 --> 13:31.394
Exactly.

13:31.394 --> 13:33.396
And so are you.

13:35.065 --> 13:38.193
I'll see you downstairs.

14:04.344 --> 14:06.471
- It's okay.
- You gonna make it?

14:08.139 --> 14:11.268
Hey, take your time.

14:11.268 --> 14:15.272
And if you need
to throw up, that's fine.

14:20.902 --> 14:22.529
Don't worry, Kayla,

14:22.529 --> 14:24.406
I was just like you

14:24.406 --> 14:26.658
when I joined DecaWin.

14:28.076 --> 14:30.036
What's... what's DecaWin?

14:30.036 --> 14:33.373
This is DecaWin.

14:33.373 --> 14:35.542
It's a women's
empowerment group.

14:35.542 --> 14:38.003
So what y'all do, like, hike?

14:38.003 --> 14:39.421
Or camp?

14:39.421 --> 14:42.299
Ah, no,
we prefer "retreat."

14:42.299 --> 14:45.844
We specialize in
unlocking female potential.

14:45.844 --> 14:49.681
Teaching, learning, training.

14:49.681 --> 14:53.977
And most of all, healing,
through E.U.

14:53.977 --> 14:56.938
Eva's
our executive director.

14:56.938 --> 14:59.232
She's really changed
every single one of our lives.

14:59.232 --> 15:00.567
I'm three years sober now.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.819
Yeah. And I just joined
more recently,

15:02.819 --> 15:05.280
but I'm already on
the last week of treatment

15:05.280 --> 15:07.157
for my fluency disorder.

15:07.157 --> 15:08.867
What's that?

15:08.867 --> 15:10.535
I used to stutter.

15:17.959 --> 15:21.713
You were doing so good
ignoring your phone.

15:21.713 --> 15:23.381
I want you to stay present.

15:23.381 --> 15:25.467
Your body is releasing
endorphins right now.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.845
All right, ladies,
let's meditate.

15:43.318 --> 15:45.070
Oof...

16:22.649 --> 16:23.817
Shit.

16:27.696 --> 16:29.906
<i>Y'all are really out here
obstructing justice.</i>

16:29.906 --> 16:32.367
<i>Spill the damn tea
and drop the name.</i>

16:32.367 --> 16:33.910
<i>Whoever bit Ni'Jah...</i>

16:33.910 --> 16:35.912
<i>needs to go play in traffic...</i>

16:36.913 --> 16:38.498
Hey.

16:39.791 --> 16:42.627
So I'm gonna head out
to the bank soon.

16:42.627 --> 16:44.546
But then I'll swing by
my friend Mark's place

16:44.546 --> 16:45.922
and pick up your wristband.

16:45.922 --> 16:48.758
Okay. Thanks.

16:48.758 --> 16:52.178
Also, Eva wanted to offer you
some free counseling.

16:52.178 --> 16:53.972
I think you'll like it.

16:53.972 --> 16:57.267
It's always nice to release
after a hike.

16:57.267 --> 16:58.893
Trust me, it's a better
use of your time

16:58.893 --> 17:00.562
than staring at your phone, okay?

17:26.963 --> 17:28.590
Right here.

17:34.804 --> 17:37.515
You came.

17:37.515 --> 17:40.226
I'm impressed.

17:40.226 --> 17:42.103
Mm.

17:45.398 --> 17:47.317
Mm.

17:47.317 --> 17:50.111
Get comfortable.

17:50.111 --> 17:52.614
You look relaxed.

17:52.614 --> 17:55.450
Was that the first time
you've meditated?

17:57.285 --> 17:58.870
I guess so.

17:59.913 --> 18:02.874
First meditation, first hike.

18:02.874 --> 18:05.877
How does it make you feel?

18:05.877 --> 18:08.296
Fine.

18:11.841 --> 18:13.676
- So...
- Mm-hmm.

18:13.676 --> 18:15.553
...this is a E.U.?

18:15.553 --> 18:18.473
Sort of. We just talk.

18:18.473 --> 18:20.975
Truthfully.

18:20.975 --> 18:25.897
I want you to relax
your mind. Okay?

18:25.897 --> 18:28.358
Like you're meditating.

18:28.358 --> 18:31.778
I'm gonna snap my fingers,
and when I do,

18:31.778 --> 18:33.613
I want you to say your name.

18:36.115 --> 18:38.076
It's what we call
a grounding point.

18:38.076 --> 18:42.247
And we're gonna keep adding
to your grounding point

18:42.247 --> 18:46.876
so it's strong,
like you.

18:48.878 --> 18:50.922
It's just a home
for your thoughts.

18:50.922 --> 18:53.132
Okay?

18:59.347 --> 19:02.475
What's your name?

19:02.475 --> 19:04.811
Kayla.

19:04.811 --> 19:07.355
What's your favorite
Ni'Jah song?

19:09.107 --> 19:11.776
Probably...

19:11.776 --> 19:14.279
Probably "Love on a Cloud"

19:14.279 --> 19:17.866
- or "I Don't Want to Leave."
- Hmm.

19:17.866 --> 19:19.742
But they're all great,
all of them, every single one.

19:19.742 --> 19:21.411
She never makes a bad song.
They're all great.

19:21.411 --> 19:22.787
- Yeah.
- Yes.

19:22.787 --> 19:24.247
They are.

19:24.247 --> 19:25.874
Yeah.

19:25.874 --> 19:28.376
"Don't Want to Leave."

19:28.376 --> 19:30.837
That's kind of a sad one.

19:30.837 --> 19:34.048
Do you remember
the first time you heard it?

19:34.048 --> 19:35.842
Mm...

19:46.895 --> 19:48.104
Name.

19:48.104 --> 19:49.188
Kayla.

19:51.900 --> 19:54.402
You must have had
a rough childhood.

19:56.070 --> 19:58.698
Did people ever
call you things as a child?

19:58.698 --> 20:02.410
Dyke. Liar. Stupid. Pig.

20:02.410 --> 20:03.870
- What are you afraid of?
- Nothing.

20:03.870 --> 20:05.288
- Are you afraid of death?
- No.

20:05.288 --> 20:07.874
Why?

20:07.874 --> 20:10.710
Because I think it's beautiful.

20:10.710 --> 20:12.086
Why?

20:12.086 --> 20:14.005
Because it's equal.

20:14.005 --> 20:16.174
Happens to everybody.

20:18.176 --> 20:21.471
- Name.
- Kayla.

20:21.471 --> 20:24.182
- Do you pray?
- I used to.

20:24.182 --> 20:25.808
Why'd you stop?

20:25.808 --> 20:28.311
Because I realized
it was just an echo.

20:28.311 --> 20:30.480
- What was?
- God.

20:38.321 --> 20:39.864
When did you first
hear Ni'Jah?

20:39.864 --> 20:43.409
- At my grandma's house.
- Describe it.

20:46.788 --> 20:49.165
Just relax into the memory.

20:49.165 --> 20:51.292
It's okay.

20:53.002 --> 20:55.880
I see...

20:55.880 --> 20:58.132
milk spilled on the carpet.

20:58.132 --> 21:00.927
And I can hear her
in the kitchen; she's cooking.

21:00.927 --> 21:03.388
Very good.

21:03.388 --> 21:06.140
What did Grandma say
when you spilled the milk?

21:06.140 --> 21:08.768
She said, "Dre,
what did you do?"

21:10.186 --> 21:12.355
And she was crying.

21:15.066 --> 21:18.194
What color was the milk?

21:19.779 --> 21:21.406
It was red.

21:23.533 --> 21:26.411
Did you
hurt someone?

21:27.996 --> 21:29.747
Yes.

21:29.747 --> 21:32.583
Very good.

21:34.210 --> 21:36.254
Very good.

21:36.254 --> 21:37.463
- Name
- Kayla.

21:37.463 --> 21:39.674
- Name.
- Dre.

21:39.674 --> 21:41.884
Very good.

21:43.886 --> 21:45.930
Tell me something you regret.

21:47.682 --> 21:49.559
I missed a call.

21:49.559 --> 21:51.477
I missed a call from back home.

21:51.477 --> 21:55.314
Your relationship
with your phone...

21:55.314 --> 21:59.235
it's tied to trauma, isn't it?

22:00.445 --> 22:03.156
- Who'd you miss a call from?
- My sister.

22:05.908 --> 22:07.827
Do you think your life
would be different

22:07.827 --> 22:09.078
if you'd answered that call?

22:09.078 --> 22:10.872
Yes.

22:13.041 --> 22:15.209
What happened to your sister?

22:25.303 --> 22:26.971
- Name.
- Ni'Jah.

22:29.599 --> 22:31.017
<i>What are you manifesting?</i>

22:32.935 --> 22:35.396
<i>Dre, what did you do?</i>

22:37.023 --> 22:38.649
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

22:43.988 --> 22:47.033
<i>Name.</i>

22:50.411 --> 22:55.249
Uh, breakfast is gonna
get cold.

22:55.249 --> 22:58.669
Spa day today.
No hiking.

23:22.777 --> 23:25.154
Hey, babe.
How's your face?

23:25.154 --> 23:28.449
My face? It hurts.

23:28.449 --> 23:30.243
What happened?

23:30.243 --> 23:33.246
- You fell. Remember?
- I fell?

23:35.289 --> 23:37.667
Let go of
the physical world.

23:37.667 --> 23:40.044
Just relax into yourself.

23:40.044 --> 23:42.547
- It helps with balance.
- Oh.

23:46.801 --> 23:49.053
Is that a scar?

23:49.053 --> 23:51.722
It's a symbol

23:51.722 --> 23:54.934
of the elements.

23:54.934 --> 23:57.311
It's also a symbol
of commitment.

23:59.147 --> 24:02.316
Our methodology isn't
pass or fail.

24:02.316 --> 24:04.861
It's based on faith.

24:04.861 --> 24:07.238
And determination.

24:07.238 --> 24:10.324
All we ask for is bond.

24:10.324 --> 24:12.869
Well, what does that mean?

24:12.869 --> 24:16.873
It's just something
that holds you accountable.

24:16.873 --> 24:19.167
Like a secret

24:19.167 --> 24:22.628
or a sacrifice.

24:22.628 --> 24:24.172
It doesn't have to be expensive.

24:24.172 --> 24:27.216
It doesn't have
to be extravagant.

24:27.216 --> 24:29.677
Don't worry,

24:29.677 --> 24:32.763
your bond holds me
accountable, too.

24:33.764 --> 24:35.474
All right, ladies,
let's get started.

24:38.144 --> 24:40.146
I want you to let go
of all your fears

24:40.146 --> 24:42.148
and insecurities.

24:43.191 --> 24:46.319
Your breath is a wave.

24:48.738 --> 24:53.451
Every inhale
touches the ocean.

25:05.379 --> 25:07.632
You seem distracted.

25:09.008 --> 25:11.719
I misplaced my phone.

25:11.719 --> 25:13.971
It's inside. Nobody here
would ever steal anything.

25:13.971 --> 25:16.098
You don't understand.
I need that phone.

25:16.098 --> 25:17.892
It's important to me, I got a
lot of important stuff on it,

25:17.892 --> 25:19.810
and I need that...

25:19.810 --> 25:21.229
- What's your name?
- Kayla.

25:21.229 --> 25:23.731
- What's your name?
- Dre.

25:25.107 --> 25:27.568
Yeah.

25:27.568 --> 25:30.446
Dre, I've noticed

25:30.446 --> 25:33.658
you've been eating less.

25:33.658 --> 25:36.285
I guess I'm not hungry.

25:36.285 --> 25:37.954
Has your mind felt clearer?

25:37.954 --> 25:40.498
Maybe.

25:40.498 --> 25:42.875
What are you manifesting
right now?

25:45.294 --> 25:48.214
Talking to Ni'Jah.
I don't...

25:48.214 --> 25:50.091
I need to be with her.

25:50.091 --> 25:52.760
Is that why you didn't
like Khalid?

25:55.680 --> 25:57.431
What?

25:57.431 --> 25:59.850
Marissa's boyfriend.

26:02.812 --> 26:05.398
What are you...
What are you talking about?

26:06.649 --> 26:09.485
Two nights ago...

26:09.485 --> 26:12.446
We were talking
about your sister,

26:12.446 --> 26:15.491
and living in Houston,
and how you were angry.

26:15.491 --> 26:19.412
No, I never said that.

26:19.412 --> 26:22.248
But you do hurt people.

26:26.294 --> 26:27.837
Remember,
you have to be honest.

26:27.837 --> 26:30.047
You're not a liar.

26:33.926 --> 26:37.513
- Sometimes.
- I need you to tell me

26:37.513 --> 26:40.141
about the owners
of the car you have.

26:41.726 --> 26:44.478
Why was there blood
on the seat?

26:48.024 --> 26:50.735
Okay, all right. Listen.

26:50.735 --> 26:52.653
Listen to me.

26:53.946 --> 26:56.532
I just went to talk to her.

26:56.532 --> 26:58.409
That's it.

27:00.453 --> 27:02.872
But she wasn't
a very nice person.

27:02.872 --> 27:04.623
Mm.

27:04.623 --> 27:08.794
- And she just kept talking
so much shit...
- Mm.

27:08.794 --> 27:11.839
...about my friend.

27:11.839 --> 27:13.966
You mean Ni'Jah?

27:15.926 --> 27:17.595
And then what?

27:18.596 --> 27:21.349
And... and then I hit her.

27:21.349 --> 27:24.769
Again, and again, and again,

27:24.769 --> 27:27.688
and again and guess what?

27:27.688 --> 27:30.191
Ooh, I really liked it.

27:30.191 --> 27:32.777
It made me happy.

27:43.788 --> 27:45.748
You're a warrior.

27:52.338 --> 27:54.882
Just like Ni'Jah.

27:54.882 --> 27:57.134
You know that, right?

28:10.272 --> 28:13.234
I want us all to congratulate
Kayla on her progress.

28:13.234 --> 28:16.320
I think she's really strong.

28:16.320 --> 28:18.322
And today she took
a real step forward

28:18.322 --> 28:19.782
in her spiritual journey.

28:19.782 --> 28:21.075
We're so proud of you.

28:21.075 --> 28:22.201
- Congratulations.
- Really.

28:22.201 --> 28:23.536
So brave.

28:23.536 --> 28:26.080
So glad you're here.

28:26.080 --> 28:27.164
So excited.

28:27.164 --> 28:29.333
A lot better
than I did.

28:29.333 --> 28:31.877
It's time to tap
into the power around us

28:31.877 --> 28:35.381
and manifest our intentions.

28:35.381 --> 28:37.550
Audrey, are you ready?

28:46.267 --> 28:48.352
Let's close our eyes.

28:49.770 --> 28:50.729
Thank you.

29:40.779 --> 29:43.491
What-what sound is that?

29:47.745 --> 29:49.747
I don't hear anything.

29:52.208 --> 29:55.419
The mu... the music.

29:55.419 --> 29:57.254
You don't hear that?

29:58.839 --> 30:01.759
Janine, do you hear something?

30:02.801 --> 30:06.764
- No.
- Dre, we don't hear anything.

30:09.975 --> 30:11.894
Oh, you-you told her.

30:13.687 --> 30:15.773
You told her.

30:15.773 --> 30:18.275
You told her my real name.

30:18.275 --> 30:20.444
What-what day is it?

30:21.445 --> 30:23.864
- Please...
- What day is it?!

30:23.864 --> 30:25.616
- I don't...
- Uh, Friday maybe?

30:29.245 --> 30:32.081
You all are fucking liars!

30:35.292 --> 30:37.670
- Who cares what day it is?
- The festival!

30:37.670 --> 30:38.754
Dre!

30:38.754 --> 30:39.838
All right,
I want us all

30:39.838 --> 30:41.090
to resume breathing.

30:47.846 --> 30:49.014
Dre, where you going?

30:49.014 --> 30:50.891
I can't miss Ni'Jah.

30:50.891 --> 30:52.810
What about the ceremony?

30:52.810 --> 30:55.563
Why are you leaving?

30:55.563 --> 30:58.607
Give me my phone.

30:58.607 --> 31:01.527
It's a 40-minute drive
to the festival.

31:01.527 --> 31:02.736
By the time
you even get there...

31:02.736 --> 31:04.738
You took my phone
while I was sleep,

31:04.738 --> 31:06.323
and I want it.

31:06.323 --> 31:10.995
Give me my fucking phone.

31:10.995 --> 31:13.539
Why are you running away?

31:14.707 --> 31:16.584
You know you're free to go.

31:17.710 --> 31:20.379
We are all free

31:20.379 --> 31:23.674
to do whatever we want.

31:23.674 --> 31:25.843
But I need you to know...

31:29.221 --> 31:31.890
...if you leave,

31:31.890 --> 31:34.727
we know everything about you.

31:37.271 --> 31:40.733
We know everything.

31:40.733 --> 31:44.653
We had an agreement
when you gave us your bond.

31:46.989 --> 31:49.408
Your phone is accountability.

31:51.327 --> 31:53.912
I'm late.

31:53.912 --> 31:57.708
Give me my phone.

31:57.708 --> 31:59.793
That's what you want?

32:08.719 --> 32:10.846
Ni'Jah isn't your real friend.

32:10.846 --> 32:15.809
Those people on the Internet
aren't your real friends.

32:15.809 --> 32:19.730
I am.

32:19.730 --> 32:21.607
Day one.

32:24.485 --> 32:28.614
Since day one I knew that.

32:31.992 --> 32:33.535
You're with your family now.

32:40.417 --> 32:42.419
You are.

32:45.506 --> 32:48.050
Come on, Dre, come inside.

32:48.050 --> 32:51.762
- Let's go.
- Yeah, you belong here.

32:51.762 --> 32:53.972
I know you're stronger
than this.

32:56.767 --> 32:57.935
Your energy...

33:04.108 --> 33:05.776
Eva!

33:12.116 --> 33:17.079
What the fuck did you do?!

33:34.263 --> 33:37.391
Give me the fucking keys!
Give me the fucking keys!

35:19.785 --> 35:20.994
I'm gonna need you
to turn around, ma'am.

35:20.994 --> 35:23.247
The show's over.

35:23.247 --> 35:26.124
These gates are gonna close.
You can't go in there.

35:26.124 --> 35:28.669
Ma'am, go ahead
and come up here,

35:28.669 --> 35:31.380
make a U-turn and go
back out for me, okay?

35:31.380 --> 35:33.465
Have a good night.

36:10.043 --> 36:14.548
