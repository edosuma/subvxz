<i>Previously on</i>
Party of Five...

00:07.174 --> 00:09.301
Man: Please welcome
the organizer of this event,

00:09.301 --> 00:10.260
Lucia Acosta.

00:10.260 --> 00:11.887
It's not the biggest fight.

00:11.887 --> 00:13.138
It's not the ultimate fight.

00:13.889 --> 00:15.224
But it's tonight's fight.

00:15.224 --> 00:16.475
(applause)

00:16.475 --> 00:18.602
And now, please welcome

00:18.602 --> 00:20.103
The Natural Disasters.

00:20.103 --> 00:21.230
Whoo‐hoo!

00:21.230 --> 00:23.232
(rock music playing)

00:24.650 --> 00:25.692
(music stops)

00:26.735 --> 00:27.611
Didn't feel right.

00:27.611 --> 00:29.112
‐What didn't?
‐The place,

00:29.112 --> 00:30.197
th‐the song.

00:30.197 --> 00:32.157
Look, you're about to be
very, very mad at me,

00:32.157 --> 00:33.200
but in my defense...

00:33.200 --> 00:34.493
You called my dad!

00:34.493 --> 00:36.203
Amanda and I
dance together.

00:36.203 --> 00:37.496
Do you mind getting
a picture of us.

00:37.496 --> 00:39.414
Okay. Smile.

00:39.414 --> 00:40.666
You too, Amanda.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.127
Does being an Amanda
feel safer

00:44.127 --> 00:46.004
than being
a Valentina?

00:50.175 --> 00:52.302
(hip‐hop music playing)

01:16.159 --> 01:17.160
<i>♪ Drop it ♪</i>

01:22.541 --> 01:25.085
♪♪

01:27.212 --> 01:29.256
Man: Ohh!

01:29.256 --> 01:30.632
Ohh, yeah!

01:30.632 --> 01:32.301
‐Amanda! Way to go!
‐Girl: Go, Amanda.

01:32.301 --> 01:33.844
Way to bring it home.

01:33.844 --> 01:35.012
All: Go, Amanda!

01:35.012 --> 01:35.929
(clapping rhythmically)

01:35.929 --> 01:37.097
Go, Amanda!

01:38.515 --> 01:39.808
Go, Amanda!

01:42.269 --> 01:44.187
When we get home,
you can tell Natalia

01:44.187 --> 01:45.772
I'm not speaking to her.

01:45.772 --> 01:47.691
I won't be able
to tell her myself because

01:48.358 --> 01:50.360
I am not speaking
to her.

01:50.360 --> 01:52.195
You can't blame
Natalia, Val.

01:52.904 --> 01:53.864
She was worried
about you.

01:54.573 --> 01:55.365
I'm worried about you.

01:55.949 --> 01:57.701
Well, you can stop worrying.

01:58.201 --> 01:59.703
‐I'm fine!
‐No.

01:59.703 --> 02:01.830
No, you're not fine, Val,
not if you're too afraid

02:01.830 --> 02:02.998
to tell people
your own name.

02:04.124 --> 02:07.127
That was something I did
on the first day, okay?

02:07.627 --> 02:09.671
I walked in,
I signed up,

02:09.671 --> 02:11.798
I looked around,
and I didn't see

02:11.798 --> 02:13.050
anyone else
who looked like me.

02:13.050 --> 02:15.177
And I just thought,
what if I used a name

02:15.177 --> 02:16.720
that didn't make me
stick out?

02:17.304 --> 02:19.681
Because the fact that
I don't have parents

02:19.681 --> 02:20.932
makes me stick out enough.

02:20.932 --> 02:22.643
Val, you do have parents.

02:22.643 --> 02:24.770
Not like those girls do.

02:24.770 --> 02:26.772
Mami and Papi
are never gonna show up

02:26.772 --> 02:28.190
to see me dance.

02:28.190 --> 02:30.484
And when you have
the name Amanda Davis,

02:30.484 --> 02:32.277
no one thinks
maybe the reason

02:32.277 --> 02:33.445
your parents aren't there
is because

02:33.445 --> 02:35.030
they got thrown
out of the country.

02:41.495 --> 02:43.080
Are we driving or what?

02:47.542 --> 02:48.794
(engine starts)

02:50.921 --> 02:52.005
(knocking on door)

02:57.010 --> 02:59.763
Uh, one oat milk latte
and, uh,

02:59.763 --> 03:02.099
six thousand dollars
of liquid justice.

03:02.641 --> 03:04.101
All the cash
we raised last night.

03:04.101 --> 03:05.977
You didn't have
to bring this here,

03:05.977 --> 03:07.104
but thank you.

03:07.104 --> 03:08.355
And thank you.

03:10.440 --> 03:13.068
Uh, I wanted to check in
about what happened last night.

03:13.443 --> 03:16.238
Ha! It's definitely going
to be an evening to remember.

03:18.115 --> 03:20.534
Isn't that stuff you see
all the time on the front lines?

03:20.909 --> 03:24.037
Punches getting thrown?
People yelling insults
at each other?

03:24.037 --> 03:26.123
I'm not talking about
what happened with your brother.

03:26.123 --> 03:27.290
I'm talking about you.

03:28.250 --> 03:30.961
That speech
of yours... Ah!

03:31.670 --> 03:34.047
Oh. Uh, well, there was
a lot there to inspire me‐‐

03:34.047 --> 03:34.923
No.

03:35.799 --> 03:37.801
Just sit with that
for a second.

03:38.260 --> 03:40.762
You really came
into your own, Lucia.

03:41.304 --> 03:44.015
And you're going to learn
how to take a compliment
before I'm done with you.

03:47.102 --> 03:50.021
Uh, so what's next?
Another event?

03:51.273 --> 03:52.274
No.

03:52.274 --> 03:55.068
After every fundraiser,
we have a follow‐up dinner

03:55.068 --> 03:57.154
to discuss distribution
of funds.

03:57.696 --> 03:59.781
Have you ever planned
a meal for activists?

04:00.240 --> 04:02.784
Vegan. Gluten free.
Paleo...

04:02.784 --> 04:04.077
And you're
a vegetarian.

04:04.077 --> 04:06.830
Yeah, but that's mostly
because of climate change.

04:07.330 --> 04:09.583
Twist my arm and I'll eat
a Double Double.

04:10.292 --> 04:11.251
(laughs)

04:13.420 --> 04:17.299
Uh... well, if there's
any way I can help, uh...

04:17.924 --> 04:19.092
Maybe you don't
know this about me‐‐

04:19.718 --> 04:21.136
really, why would you,

04:21.136 --> 04:22.596
but I love to cook.

04:22.596 --> 04:23.680
Huh?

04:39.362 --> 04:41.406
‐Hey.
‐Good morning.

04:42.574 --> 04:44.659
So, what happened
after my dad hauled me off?

04:44.659 --> 04:46.411
Did Emilio get in trouble
with the cops?

04:47.204 --> 04:48.371
No, it was okay
in the end.

04:49.372 --> 04:50.290
Look, I was just‐‐

04:50.290 --> 04:51.541
I was up
all night worried

04:51.541 --> 04:52.542
that I'd screwed
everything up

04:52.542 --> 04:53.960
for you
and your family.

04:55.253 --> 04:56.797
Well, if you were
so worried,

04:56.797 --> 04:58.632
why didn't you
text me back last night?

04:58.632 --> 05:00.175
Because my dad
took my phone away

05:00.175 --> 05:02.052
along with everything else:

05:02.052 --> 05:04.179
you know, my car,
my freedom.

05:05.222 --> 05:06.681
I had to climb out a window
to get here.

05:08.141 --> 05:09.142
(sighs)

05:11.061 --> 05:12.103
Sometimes it's...

05:13.688 --> 05:15.857
it's hard to know
where I stand with you.

05:16.858 --> 05:18.235
You can blow
hot and cold.

05:18.235 --> 05:20.987
Mad last night,
sorry this morning.

05:20.987 --> 05:22.447
Keeps you on
your toes, though, yes?

05:24.157 --> 05:25.200
(sighs)

05:25.200 --> 05:27.202
It's one way I'm different
than my dad.

05:27.202 --> 05:28.787
You know, he decides how
he feels about a person

05:28.787 --> 05:32.207
and then there's absolutely
no changing his mind.

05:32.958 --> 05:34.376
That guy is never
gonna like me.

05:35.252 --> 05:37.671
We ruined the first night
of his new life, remember?

05:39.047 --> 05:41.049
He's never gonna forgive
either of us for that.

05:46.304 --> 05:47.639
What about your mom?

05:49.349 --> 05:52.394
Do you ever think
about living with her?

05:52.894 --> 05:55.564
Sure. Yeah.
I just‐‐ I, um...

05:56.106 --> 05:57.023
(sniffles)

05:58.358 --> 05:59.651
It's complicated.

06:01.027 --> 06:03.697
She's not very good
at taking care
of other people.

06:04.489 --> 06:05.991
Well, do you
even need that?

06:06.408 --> 06:07.409
I don't know.

06:08.869 --> 06:11.037
I'm 16. Aren't I
supposed to need it?

06:11.955 --> 06:13.415
Well, nobody's
taking care of me...

06:15.417 --> 06:17.085
and I seem to be doing
pretty well.

06:18.587 --> 06:21.840
Emilio: I must admit,
uh, it's a little weird
having you here.

06:21.840 --> 06:24.217
Well, you haven't been
over to my house

06:24.217 --> 06:25.302
in a long time either, so...

06:25.844 --> 06:26.928
we're even.

06:30.473 --> 06:34.060
So, uh, do I just insist
that she be honest with them?

06:34.811 --> 06:35.687
No matter what
it costs her?

06:37.188 --> 06:38.315
(slurps)

06:40.108 --> 06:41.109
Well?

06:42.444 --> 06:44.279
Is it really that you
don't know what to say
to her, Emilio?

06:44.946 --> 06:47.032
Or are you asking me
to do it for you?

06:47.032 --> 06:48.742
Look, I'm just
her brother.

06:49.743 --> 06:51.786
Right? I think it'd mean more
coming from a priest.

06:52.954 --> 06:54.122
But you've laid down
the law in the past.

06:55.040 --> 06:56.875
So why are you having
trouble now, do you think?

06:57.167 --> 06:58.084
(sighs)

06:58.793 --> 07:00.670
I'm wondering if you feel
like you lack

07:00.670 --> 07:02.547
the moral authority
to make your case.

07:03.381 --> 07:04.341
What do you mean?

07:05.675 --> 07:07.427
Some of my parishioners were
at the fundraiser last night.

07:08.428 --> 07:10.138
I heard how you walked
off the stage‐‐

07:10.138 --> 07:11.222
Jesus!

07:11.222 --> 07:13.141
Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry.

07:13.850 --> 07:15.060
(sighs)
Look, Padre,

07:15.727 --> 07:17.062
I don't know
what you heard,

07:17.062 --> 07:18.313
but it was just
the wrong song.

07:18.813 --> 07:19.856
That's all.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.567
And what would've been
a better song?

07:22.567 --> 07:23.735
I don't know.

07:23.735 --> 07:24.778
Something that's not
about what your hair

07:24.778 --> 07:25.737
looks like after sex.

07:26.363 --> 07:27.572
Sorry.

07:28.073 --> 07:29.658
Shit! Oh, sorry!

07:31.451 --> 07:32.744
(sighs)

07:32.744 --> 07:33.995
Let me ask you, Emilio.

07:34.788 --> 07:37.457
Do you have those other kinds
of songs in your repertoire?

07:37.999 --> 07:40.210
Or would you say they're all
a variation on the, uh,

07:40.210 --> 07:41.753
hair and sex theme?

07:42.879 --> 07:44.089
So what if they are?

07:44.964 --> 07:46.716
No. No, no,
I mean it, Padre.

07:47.300 --> 07:48.802
What's wrong with that?

07:51.971 --> 07:54.516
Your sister does not yet
have those, uh...

07:54.516 --> 07:57.560
alarm bells that go off
when who she shows
herself to be

07:58.353 --> 08:00.146
doesn't match
who she truly is.

08:00.146 --> 08:01.731
But you have them,
Emilio.

08:03.775 --> 08:05.193
You might not want
to listen,

08:05.777 --> 08:06.778
but they're sounding.

08:10.365 --> 08:12.492
‐(sighs)
‐Is Val upstairs?

08:15.870 --> 08:17.414
I'll go have
a word with her.

08:23.628 --> 08:24.629
Teresa: Ooh!

08:26.131 --> 08:28.174
Didn't your mother
teach you how to cook?

08:28.174 --> 08:30.385
Nope. Never wanted me
to learn.

08:30.385 --> 08:32.137
She'd come home
after working

08:32.137 --> 08:34.347
12‐hour days
at a candy factory

08:34.347 --> 08:36.182
and make me
sit on a stool

08:36.182 --> 08:38.059
and read to her
from my school books

08:38.059 --> 08:39.436
while she cooked
my dinner.

08:40.353 --> 08:43.189
She wanted me to have a life
where I used my mind,

08:43.189 --> 08:44.649
not my hands.

08:45.025 --> 08:46.234
Hmm.

08:46.234 --> 08:47.277
My mother thought
it was something

08:47.277 --> 08:48.778
every girl should know.

08:48.778 --> 08:51.281
Yeah, well,
joke's on me though

08:51.281 --> 08:54.284
'cause now I live alone
and I can't feed myself.

08:54.784 --> 08:56.494
I don't know
what I'm gonna do
when I have kids.

08:57.662 --> 09:00.290
So, you're planning
on having kids?

09:00.290 --> 09:01.291
Um...

09:01.875 --> 09:03.710
I mean, yeah.

09:03.710 --> 09:05.170
Eventually.

09:05.170 --> 09:06.129
You?

09:06.963 --> 09:09.174
Maybe that's not something
you know just quite yet.

09:09.924 --> 09:11.051
Oh, I‐I know.

09:11.051 --> 09:12.802
I, I definitely know.

09:13.553 --> 09:16.181
Kids. Yes. Absolutely.
Gotta have 'em.

09:19.976 --> 09:22.771
Do you worry about
being able to raise a family

09:22.771 --> 09:24.272
and focus
on your career?

09:24.272 --> 09:26.274
God! I hate that question.

09:26.274 --> 09:28.860
Me, too.
It's the worst.

09:28.860 --> 09:29.986
(door opens)

09:31.529 --> 09:32.405
Hey.

09:32.405 --> 09:33.865
Oh.

09:34.324 --> 09:36.034
What's this?

09:36.034 --> 09:38.244
Teresa: Lucia offered
to cook for us all.

09:38.244 --> 09:40.246
Allison: Oh, fantastic!

09:40.246 --> 09:41.498
So we don't have
to have Poison Control

09:41.498 --> 09:43.708
‐on hold all night?
‐(chuckles)

09:45.168 --> 09:46.044
<i>Hola, querida.</i>

09:47.337 --> 09:49.506
So, I'm just gonna put
my stuff down in the bedroom,

09:49.506 --> 09:52.050
and then are you gonna make
a liquor store run or should I?

09:52.050 --> 09:53.218
(conversation fades)

09:57.722 --> 09:58.807
Ella: Mom.

09:58.807 --> 10:00.058
Suffocating here.

10:00.058 --> 10:01.351
Really.

10:01.351 --> 10:04.145
Are you absolutely certain?
Do you really mean it?

10:04.145 --> 10:05.814
She really means it,
Mrs. Barnett.

10:07.357 --> 10:09.192
Nothing could make me happier.

10:09.859 --> 10:11.820
I mean,
<i>mi casa es su casa.</i>

10:12.612 --> 10:14.072
I didn't say that
because you're...

10:15.406 --> 10:18.827
Oh God. Words just fly
out of my mouth sometimes.

10:18.827 --> 10:20.954
Please, Beto,
forgive me.

10:21.579 --> 10:23.456
‐It's okay.
‐Ella: This was Beto's idea.

10:23.456 --> 10:25.959
I am so grateful
to have you as an ally, Beto.

10:26.376 --> 10:29.170
The only advocates in my life
charge me $700 an hour.

10:30.213 --> 10:31.673
Speaking of which,
I should call my lawyer.

10:33.049 --> 10:35.093
But I thought custody
was fifty‐fifty.

10:35.093 --> 10:36.803
Margaux: Ugh. It is,

10:36.803 --> 10:38.054
but nothing riles Jim up

10:38.054 --> 10:39.931
like a person willing
to take him on.

10:39.931 --> 10:41.724
Well, you know, right?

10:42.642 --> 10:44.227
He doesn't like anyone
who's an Alpha.

10:44.227 --> 10:46.229
I, I wouldn't say
I'm an Alpha.

10:46.229 --> 10:48.231
Well, you went to his office
to meet with him.

10:48.231 --> 10:51.192
Sounds pretty Alpha
to me. Oh!

10:51.776 --> 10:54.487
Hi, Jennifer Randle,
please. Thanks.

10:54.487 --> 10:57.198
Wait, you went to see
my dad? At his office?

10:57.198 --> 10:59.868
I thought if I could get
on his good side somehow...

10:59.868 --> 11:02.078
So, you two
talked about me?

11:02.078 --> 11:04.706
‐Behind my back?
‐I was trying to make
things easier.

11:04.706 --> 11:06.457
We talked about this
this morning.

11:06.457 --> 11:07.750
Why didn't you
tell me then?

11:07.750 --> 11:09.210
‐Because‐‐
‐Margaux: Oh, again,

11:09.210 --> 11:11.212
words fly out.

11:11.212 --> 11:12.589
I, I didn't mean
to start a fight.

11:12.589 --> 11:13.798
‐Beto: No‐‐
‐No, we're not,

11:13.798 --> 11:14.757
we're not fighting, Mom.

11:14.757 --> 11:16.050
‐(sighs)
‐Ella: It's, um...

11:16.050 --> 11:18.261
‐It's fine.
‐Beto: Mm‐hmm.

11:18.261 --> 11:19.220
Ella: It's in the past.

11:19.220 --> 11:21.097
You are staying
the night, young man.

11:21.097 --> 11:23.183
And not in that sad twin
in Ella's room.

11:23.183 --> 11:24.559
I'm gonna give
you two my bed.

11:25.268 --> 11:27.979
Oh, uh, that's really
not necessary, Mrs. Barnett.

11:28.605 --> 11:30.607
Oh, Margaux, please.

11:30.607 --> 11:32.066
And I insist.

11:32.984 --> 11:34.194
Hello, Jennifer...

11:34.194 --> 11:37.155
Well, that was $125 worth
of Celine Dion.

11:39.991 --> 11:42.577
Well, she loves you,
that's for sure.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.542
Kindly explain
your selection process.

11:50.210 --> 11:52.086
She is clueless
about wine.

11:52.086 --> 11:53.796
Teresa:
I decided I could buy

11:53.796 --> 11:55.924
three bottles of $10 wine

11:55.924 --> 11:58.593
or 10 bottles of $3 wine.

11:58.593 --> 12:00.970
Bet you anything this stuff
tastes like salad dressing.

12:01.846 --> 12:04.515
Teresa:
Can you set the table?
I'll be out in 10.

12:04.515 --> 12:05.683
Shall we see?

12:06.142 --> 12:07.393
Uh, no, thanks.

12:10.230 --> 12:12.732
So, is everyone who's coming
at the fundraiser last night?

12:12.732 --> 12:14.901
There'll probably be
some new plus ones.

12:15.610 --> 12:18.196
Everyone in this group
has pretty much slept
with everyone, so...

12:18.988 --> 12:20.698
Although... wait,

12:20.698 --> 12:22.075
have I...

12:22.867 --> 12:24.369
No. None of my exes
are coming tonight.

12:24.369 --> 12:25.870
Well, except Sully.

12:28.081 --> 12:30.708
So, you and she
<i>aren't</i> together?

12:31.417 --> 12:33.294
‐Or you are?
‐Exactly.

12:34.295 --> 12:36.589
Now this is surprisingly
not terrible.

12:37.340 --> 12:38.341
Here. You gotta try it.

12:40.051 --> 12:40.885
Finish it.

12:42.220 --> 12:43.221
I'll pour a new glass.

12:45.890 --> 12:48.184
So, do you have
one of those

12:48.184 --> 12:49.978
are‐we‐or‐aren't‐we,
depends‐on‐the‐day

12:49.978 --> 12:51.104
kind of relationships?

12:51.104 --> 12:53.898
Ah. Well, I mean,
who doesn't?

12:53.898 --> 12:55.984
Hmm. So you get it.

12:56.651 --> 13:00.154
I mean, we're not poly,
but we're definitely not mono.

13:00.655 --> 13:02.490
Pretty much just
is what it is.

13:03.157 --> 13:06.286
Ultimately, I believe
in not limiting your options.

13:06.286 --> 13:08.288
I mean, I show up
with my suitcase,

13:08.288 --> 13:10.581
sometimes I stay
long enough to unpack it,

13:10.581 --> 13:11.916
sometimes I don't.

13:11.916 --> 13:13.084
But at the end
of the day,

13:13.876 --> 13:15.128
Sully and I both know
I'll eventually

13:15.128 --> 13:16.796
be unpacking it
someplace else.

13:21.175 --> 13:22.260
To freedom.

13:24.262 --> 13:25.263
Freedom.

13:29.267 --> 13:31.978
(gulps)

13:34.063 --> 13:36.399
(doorbell chimes)

13:40.695 --> 13:42.321
You ever plan
on calling me back?

13:43.740 --> 13:45.324
It's just gonna
get ugly, dude.

13:46.492 --> 13:48.619
I figure if we don't say
what we're thinking,

13:48.619 --> 13:49.912
maybe in...

13:50.997 --> 13:53.082
a few months or years,

13:53.082 --> 13:55.168
we'll be able to sit down
and have a few beers.

14:03.051 --> 14:04.302
Actually, uh...

14:05.845 --> 14:07.180
you knew
what I was thinking.

14:08.014 --> 14:09.140
Long before I did.

14:09.932 --> 14:11.142
I thought it was just
that one song,

14:11.142 --> 14:13.061
but it's all
the songs, man.

14:14.645 --> 14:16.481
And the truth is,
I don't think I can sing songs

14:16.481 --> 14:18.107
about a life
I'm not living anymore.

14:19.108 --> 14:20.443
(sighs)

14:22.278 --> 14:23.362
I‐I‐‐

14:23.362 --> 14:24.739
I guess it's time
for me to move on.

14:25.990 --> 14:27.200
And you should, too, man.

14:28.201 --> 14:30.078
Seriously, dude.
Go make some new music.

14:30.995 --> 14:32.955
It's hard enough watching
you guys do this without me,

14:32.955 --> 14:34.457
do you really have to do it
using the stuff I wrote?

14:35.249 --> 14:38.002
We've got a session
on Monday, man.

14:38.711 --> 14:40.004
The studio is booked.

14:40.797 --> 14:42.590
We're not gonna pull the plug
and take six months

14:42.590 --> 14:43.800
to write new material
and hope,

14:43.800 --> 14:45.927
just hope that it's
good enough to land us

14:45.927 --> 14:47.762
back where we are
right now.

14:51.099 --> 14:52.308
We need those songs.

14:55.520 --> 14:57.021
Come on, man. Please.

15:03.069 --> 15:04.821
You at least going
to include me
in the liner notes?

15:06.405 --> 15:08.199
We'll dedicate
the whole album to you, man.

15:11.119 --> 15:11.994
(laughs)

15:17.834 --> 15:19.961
‐Thanks, bro.
‐Mm‐hmm.

15:20.503 --> 15:21.337
(door closes)

15:22.880 --> 15:24.132
Anyone home?

15:27.593 --> 15:28.636
Who wants dinner?

15:30.179 --> 15:31.305
<i>Ai.</i>

15:34.100 --> 15:35.059
So...

15:35.560 --> 15:39.397
after you <i>made</i>
Padre Jimenez lecture me,

15:39.897 --> 15:41.065
I called Kelly.

15:41.732 --> 15:42.775
Guess what she said?

15:43.526 --> 15:44.527
Guess.

15:45.778 --> 15:48.156
‐Uh...
‐She called me a liar!

15:48.156 --> 15:51.117
And said that impersonating
someone on Instagram

15:51.117 --> 15:53.286
is a felony
and I could be arrested!

15:53.286 --> 15:54.871
That's not true, Val.

15:54.871 --> 15:56.122
You didn't impersonate anyone.

15:56.914 --> 15:58.875
You made a fake name,
like half the people
on the internet.

15:58.875 --> 16:01.752
Not the half
that's blocked me
from their DMs.

16:02.253 --> 16:04.130
Kelly told the whole
entire troupe,

16:04.130 --> 16:06.090
and they deleted me
from the chat.

16:06.090 --> 16:07.717
Well, give them some time.
They'll come around.

16:08.801 --> 16:11.095
If you want, I'll go down there
with you and talk to them.

16:11.095 --> 16:12.221
Hmm?

16:12.221 --> 16:14.015
Stay away from me.

16:15.224 --> 16:18.644
You act like you understand,
but you don't understand.

16:19.145 --> 16:20.897
No one understands.

16:20.897 --> 16:23.983
Not Natalia who...
ratted me out.

16:24.609 --> 16:26.986
Or Lucia
who doesn't listen.

16:27.987 --> 16:31.032
Or even Beto,
'cause he's never around.

16:33.284 --> 16:36.495
Only Mami understands...

16:39.874 --> 16:41.626
but you don't let me
talk to her either.

16:43.586 --> 16:45.129
You take everything away!

16:45.588 --> 16:46.672
Everything!

16:49.425 --> 16:50.426
Val‐‐

16:52.845 --> 16:53.888
(door slams)

17:02.855 --> 17:04.607
‐(toilet flushes)
‐(knocking on door)

17:04.607 --> 17:05.942
Teresa: Lucia.

17:06.609 --> 17:08.277
We're just sitting down
for your dinner.

17:08.277 --> 17:09.403
Can you join us?

17:10.738 --> 17:12.698
Uh... in a minute.

17:13.532 --> 17:16.160
Teresa: It's been a while.
I just wanted to check on you.

17:18.412 --> 17:19.997
‐Open up.
‐(sighs)

17:27.213 --> 17:28.965
Oh my God.

17:29.966 --> 17:31.467
What was she thinking?

17:32.510 --> 17:33.928
(tap running)

17:36.764 --> 17:38.057
Take a sip.

17:38.599 --> 17:39.600
Lucia.

17:42.186 --> 17:45.314
Honestly, I cannot believe
Allison gave you all that wine.

17:47.275 --> 17:48.985
It felt right
in the moment.

17:50.069 --> 17:52.113
Isn't that how she makes
her decisions:

17:52.613 --> 17:53.948
whatever feels right?

17:54.949 --> 17:56.200
W‐what do you mean?

17:58.828 --> 17:59.829
I mean...

18:00.621 --> 18:02.123
isn't that how
she's with you?

18:03.791 --> 18:05.001
What did she tell you?

18:06.544 --> 18:09.797
Just that you two
are on and off and...

18:10.464 --> 18:12.300
she's the one
who comes and goes.

18:14.093 --> 18:17.054
Which doesn't seem like
something you'd want.

18:17.513 --> 18:19.015
Not if you want a family.

18:19.682 --> 18:22.226
Uh, okay, well,
that's personal.

18:22.226 --> 18:25.062
‐Allison shouldn't have‐‐
‐You're so, like...

18:26.230 --> 18:27.023
committed.

18:28.190 --> 18:29.483
To everything.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.361
Causes. People.

18:33.613 --> 18:36.282
When you're with someone,
you're with them.

18:38.743 --> 18:40.620
Like how you are
when you're with me.

18:50.463 --> 18:52.340
Why would you want
to be with someone

18:52.340 --> 18:55.009
who only wants to be
with you some of the time?

19:00.389 --> 19:02.933
Listen to me... Lucia.

19:05.269 --> 19:07.813
You're not in any shape
for a dinner party.

19:09.732 --> 19:12.026
I think you should go
and lie down in the guest room.

19:13.319 --> 19:14.654
You can sleep
in there tonight,

19:14.654 --> 19:16.364
and we'll talk about this
in the morning.

19:17.573 --> 19:18.574
Okay?

19:21.202 --> 19:21.994
I'm sorry.

19:22.620 --> 19:23.412
(door closes)

19:23.954 --> 19:24.955
(sighs)

19:34.715 --> 19:36.550
Emilio:
Is it a 12‐year‐old
girl thing?

19:36.550 --> 19:38.552
Because Micah and I
just had a falling out

19:38.552 --> 19:40.596
and 24 hours later,
we're good.

19:41.263 --> 19:42.431
It's an every girl thing.

19:43.224 --> 19:45.101
We hold grudges
to the death.

19:45.559 --> 19:47.103
‐No exceptions.
‐(chuckles)

19:47.103 --> 19:48.521
‐Yeah.
‐Are you gonna try

19:48.521 --> 19:50.606
to write some new songs
for yourself?

19:51.482 --> 19:53.651
What about? Invoices?

19:54.443 --> 19:56.112
What rhymes
with diaper rash?

19:56.529 --> 19:57.863
Mustache.

19:57.863 --> 19:59.240
Eyelash.

19:59.240 --> 20:00.408
Take out the trash.

20:02.326 --> 20:03.828
Poet, remember?

20:05.746 --> 20:07.039
Maybe we could...

20:07.790 --> 20:09.291
I don't know...
collaborate.

20:10.501 --> 20:12.712
I could help with the words
if you wrote the music.

20:14.088 --> 20:15.506
You wanna be
a songwriter?

20:16.549 --> 20:18.884
Aren't lyrics
a type of poetry?

20:18.884 --> 20:19.885
You said that.

20:20.928 --> 20:21.929
Yeah.

20:23.264 --> 20:25.266
You'd be slumming it,
working with me.

20:26.267 --> 20:27.977
I mean,
your stuff is so...

20:29.019 --> 20:31.063
‐So what?
‐It's beautiful.

20:32.106 --> 20:33.858
And the things you
write about, they're so...

20:34.984 --> 20:36.569
big and important.

20:37.153 --> 20:38.988
Doesn't that make them
worth singing about?

20:39.864 --> 20:41.532
We don't have
the same frame of reference.

20:42.158 --> 20:44.952
I mean, the things you write
about are so specific
to your people.

20:44.952 --> 20:47.246
To your life.
To your culture.

20:47.246 --> 20:49.582
Um... don't we have
the same culture?

20:49.582 --> 20:51.375
Aren't my people
your people?

20:53.085 --> 20:54.086
Technically.

20:56.964 --> 20:57.965
Look...

20:59.258 --> 21:01.093
my parents brought me
to this country

21:01.594 --> 21:02.303
to be an American.

21:02.970 --> 21:04.805
I mean, they wanted me
to fit in.

21:05.431 --> 21:07.141
It mattered to them
that I spoke English

21:07.141 --> 21:08.267
without an accent.

21:08.976 --> 21:11.228
You know,
so I played football

21:11.228 --> 21:12.271
and not soccer.

21:13.355 --> 21:16.150
I listened to music
that wasn't anything like
my parents listened to.

21:17.359 --> 21:18.486
And all my friends have...

21:20.154 --> 21:21.155
they've been white.

21:23.199 --> 21:24.241
My girlfriends too.

21:27.161 --> 21:29.371
Suddenly, it's like
I'm betraying my people

21:29.371 --> 21:30.956
by not being
Mexican enough,

21:31.957 --> 21:33.334
not seeing myself
as part of a place

21:33.334 --> 21:35.461
my parents actually
took me away from.

21:37.379 --> 21:39.840
So, for me to sing
about the Mexican experience,

21:40.466 --> 21:43.093
the immigrant experience...

21:46.639 --> 21:47.848
it feels like a lie.

21:52.478 --> 21:55.147
(sewing machine rattling)

22:04.073 --> 22:05.783
Oh. Did I wake you?

22:05.783 --> 22:08.577
No, I, I just didn't know
what that noise was.

22:09.370 --> 22:10.454
So...

22:10.454 --> 22:12.122
Being up late
like this, it's...

22:12.706 --> 22:15.709
the best thing about
having my own place.

22:17.253 --> 22:18.796
Um, Jim

22:18.796 --> 22:21.882

Oh...

22:29.890 --> 22:31.308
Curtains for
the guest room.

22:31.308 --> 22:33.352
This is my third attempt.

22:34.270 --> 22:36.647
Jim, he thinks
that I can't finish

22:36.647 --> 22:37.940
anything that I start.

22:37.940 --> 22:40.776
But I just... I want
to get it right, you know.

22:40.776 --> 22:43.571
I just want to get
something right.

22:45.322 --> 22:46.323
You're the same.

22:47.867 --> 22:48.951
Am I?

22:50.619 --> 22:52.830
You hang in there.
I can tell.

22:54.415 --> 22:56.166
You wanna work
through problems.

22:57.751 --> 22:59.211
I'm so grateful
she has you.

23:02.047 --> 23:03.424
She seems
so much better.

23:05.551 --> 23:06.594
Better than...

23:08.178 --> 23:09.805
When she was
in the hospital.

23:12.182 --> 23:13.767
Oh. Right.

23:15.728 --> 23:16.770
It was awful.

23:17.855 --> 23:19.815
I can't tell you,
I mean, for her, too, but‐‐

23:19.815 --> 23:21.525
Did she tell you
about her roommate?

23:21.525 --> 23:23.402
The one who pulled out
all of her eyebrows?

23:25.279 --> 23:26.280
Yes.

23:27.197 --> 23:28.574
It was terrible.

23:28.574 --> 23:30.951
Of course, we wanted her
to have a private room,

23:30.951 --> 23:32.119
but they wouldn't allow it.

23:32.119 --> 23:33.746
They said that
it was safer

23:33.746 --> 23:35.122
if there was
someone else there.

23:37.333 --> 23:38.959
We thought that
we were gonna lose her.

23:40.210 --> 23:42.171
It was awful.

23:45.966 --> 23:47.134
I think that
she's turned a corner.

23:48.135 --> 23:49.303
Thanks to you.

almost happen?

as dramatic as possible.

25:27.568 --> 25:28.485
You were in restraints?

25:29.028 --> 25:29.903
No!

25:30.237 --> 25:31.905
Of course not.

25:31.905 --> 25:34.116
But I've heard her tell
the story where I was.

25:35.034 --> 25:36.618
Well, what is the story?

25:36.618 --> 25:38.120
And why haven't you
told it to me?

25:39.496 --> 25:41.999
Because you're gonna jump
to conclusions about me

25:41.999 --> 25:42.958
that aren't true.

No.

25:52.176 --> 25:54.219
Well, did you do something
that would have led people

25:54.219 --> 25:55.804
to think
you wanted to die?

25:59.183 --> 26:00.267
Look...

26:01.435 --> 26:02.770
it was two years ago.

26:03.729 --> 26:05.189
They were in the middle
of splitting up

26:05.189 --> 26:06.315

26:06.315 --> 26:07.983
day and night,
right in front of me.

26:09.359 --> 26:12.112
And the thing is,
I don't know a 14‐year‐old
in the world

26:12.112 --> 26:14.615
who could see their parents
yell at each other like that

26:14.615 --> 26:16.241
and not want
to do something.

26:19.620 --> 26:20.662
Did you take something?

You're already looking
at me differently.

‐I can feel it.

Hey.

Beto: Emilio!

26:47.272 --> 26:48.524
A bunch of her clothes
are missing from her drawer,

26:48.524 --> 26:49.691
and I think she took
her backpack.

26:49.691 --> 26:50.526
When's the last time
you saw her?

26:50.526 --> 26:51.443
I knocked on her door
last night,

26:51.443 --> 26:52.402
but she wasn't
answering me.

26:52.402 --> 26:53.529
Are you sure
she was in there?

26:53.529 --> 26:54.863
Yeah. Yeah, it was locked,
so yeah.

26:54.863 --> 26:56.198
And later?
When you got home?

26:56.198 --> 26:57.241
I didn't come home.

26:57.241 --> 26:58.200
You didn't?
Where were you?

26:58.200 --> 27:00.285
‐Where were you?
‐Emilio: Look, okay,

27:00.285 --> 27:02.246
so it's been at least 10 hours
since anyone's seen her.

27:02.246 --> 27:03.413
We need to call
the police.

27:03.413 --> 27:05.707
We can't do that.
They'll call the social worker.

27:05.707 --> 27:07.126
So what? Val's missing.

27:07.126 --> 27:08.418
The more people trying
to find her, the better.

27:08.418 --> 27:09.586
No, no. If the
social worker thinks

27:09.586 --> 27:11.088
I'm not taking care of her,
that she ran away‐‐

27:11.088 --> 27:12.631
Worry about that
after we find her

27:12.631 --> 27:13.507
and know she's safe!

27:13.507 --> 27:15.092
Ella: Well,
I doubt she ran away.

27:15.092 --> 27:16.552
She's probably
at a friend's place.

27:16.552 --> 27:18.137
She's trying
to make you worry.

27:18.137 --> 27:19.930
No. No, she wouldn't
do that.

27:20.681 --> 27:22.683
Well, if she's trying to punish
you guys, she might.

27:26.311 --> 27:28.105
‐What?
‐Emilio: No, she has a point.

27:28.105 --> 27:29.565
I mean, she was
pretty pissed at me.

27:30.607 --> 27:31.817
For what?
What did you do to her?

27:32.776 --> 27:34.111
What does it matter, Lucia?
She's gone.

27:34.111 --> 27:36.446
Okay, maybe she's
at a friend's house?

27:36.446 --> 27:38.574
Who are even her friends
from school these days?

27:38.574 --> 27:40.659
Uh, there was Cassidy,
right? Cassidy.

27:40.659 --> 27:41.827
And wasn't there a Brittany?

27:41.827 --> 27:43.245
But she doesn't
mention them anymore.

27:43.245 --> 27:44.454
I don't think she's hung
with any of them

27:44.454 --> 27:45.622
since Mami and Papi‐‐

27:45.622 --> 27:47.207
Oh, I know she likes, um,

27:47.207 --> 27:48.667
the girls from
her dance troupe.

27:48.667 --> 27:50.085
No. Trust me, she's isn't
with any of them.

27:52.337 --> 27:54.047
Maybe we should
just call Mami.

27:55.132 --> 27:56.717
That's who Val calls
when she's upset.

27:57.384 --> 27:59.094
Maybe it'd help to know

27:59.094 --> 28:00.596
when the last time
they were in touch was.

28:03.015 --> 28:04.099
Okay, try her,

28:04.099 --> 28:05.684
but you can't let her know
Val's missing.

Why do we even need it?
Shouldn't we just go get her?

28:59.112 --> 29:01.198
No, the guy said we need
two forms of ID.

29:01.198 --> 29:02.699

they'll release her to us.

down there, so...

29:14.670 --> 29:15.963

Teresa: <i>Well, could you</i>

32:31.700 --> 32:33.618

into my private life

32:33.618 --> 32:35.120

32:35.120 --> 32:37.622
<i>may have left you</i>

32:38.415 --> 32:40.834

32:53.388 --> 32:55.640
<i>And while</i>

my affection for you

Otherwise, we pick her up,
we bring her back home

34:36.950 --> 34:38.410
What's going
to be different?

34:39.619 --> 34:41.454
Maybe we take her
to a therapist?

34:41.454 --> 34:42.747
Yeah. Yeah, we could.

34:42.747 --> 34:44.291
But how much do you think
a good one costs?

34:47.460 --> 34:49.754
Oh, how should I know?
I didn't pay the bills.

34:49.754 --> 34:52.132

to get in this van

35:13.278 --> 35:14.904
and it not seem like
some kind of punishment.

want to go back to being,
