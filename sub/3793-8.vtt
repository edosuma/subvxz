01:24.384 --> 01:25.976
Mahalo, my dear.

01:27.687 --> 01:30.247
You got to love a place
where you get lei'd coming and going.

01:30.290 --> 01:32.087
Even if you don't
get laid during?

01:32.125 --> 01:34.252
Whatever.
I actually enjoyed my R&R.

01:34.294 --> 01:36.023
And I got some good color,
right bro?

01:36.062 --> 01:38.360
- Looking like George Hamilton.
- But young.

01:38.398 --> 01:40.423
Yeah yeah, the 50-year-old
George Hamilton.

01:40.467 --> 01:42.492
- Yo.
- How'd it go?

01:42.535 --> 01:44.230
Three coach,
one first class.

01:44.270 --> 01:46.204
You weren't supposed to
get any first class.

01:46.239 --> 01:47.365
It's the only seats
they had left.

01:47.407 --> 01:48.874
Otherwise we had to wait
for the night flight.

01:48.908 --> 01:50.808
Forget that.

01:52.245 --> 01:54.304
So who gets the extra
leg room?

01:54.347 --> 01:56.679
- Vince, obviously.
- No, not obviously.

01:56.716 --> 01:58.377
We'll settle it
democratically.

01:58.418 --> 02:01.444
Democratically implies
that everyone deserves a voice.

02:01.488 --> 02:04.457
My contention is broke-ass
Turtle does not.

02:04.491 --> 02:06.823
Yeah, well my contention
is Vince is the king,

02:06.860 --> 02:08.919
and if he says I get a voice
then let me be heard.

02:08.961 --> 02:10.793
I really don't care much about it.
You guys fight it out.

02:10.830 --> 02:12.457
Yeah, you know what?
Me neither.

02:12.499 --> 02:15.093
E and I will slum it like we did the first
20 years of our lives.

02:15.135 --> 02:17.103
Come on, now you're gonna
make us feel bad.

02:17.137 --> 02:20.129
I don't feel bad, pal.
Your short squat legs

02:20.173 --> 02:22.300
will not extend comfortably
without a fight.

02:22.342 --> 02:24.139
So how do we decide?

02:24.177 --> 02:26.543
I'll pick a number one to 20.
The closest man gets it.

02:26.579 --> 02:28.171
- Okay.
- No go.

02:28.214 --> 02:30.148
- Why not?
- Because you favor Turtle, bro.

02:30.183 --> 02:33.311
- What?
- It might be subconsciously, but you do.

02:33.353 --> 02:35.378
Wow.
Okay.

02:35.421 --> 02:37.184
I get it.
Excuse me, sir?

02:37.223 --> 02:39.623
Would you mind
settling this?

02:39.659 --> 02:42.389
I have one first class ticket,
both of these gentlemen want it.

02:42.428 --> 02:44.794
Will you decide?

02:46.166 --> 02:47.997
- Him.
- Yes.

02:48.034 --> 02:50.468
What the hell?
Why not me?

02:50.503 --> 02:53.563
My subconscious likes him
more better, I guess.

02:53.606 --> 02:54.903
Ha ha.

02:57.143 --> 02:58.940
Fucking foreign cabbie.

02:58.978 --> 03:00.468
Johnny,
what's the big deal?

03:00.513 --> 03:03.414
Well, if it wasn't him
there would be none. Look at him.

03:03.449 --> 03:05.178
Yeah, look at me,
heading straight into paradise.

03:05.218 --> 03:06.879
- I owe you, Vin.
- Yeah, you think?

03:09.522 --> 03:10.955
- Hello.
- Hey.

03:10.990 --> 03:13.151
- Can I take your jacket?
- Yes you can.

03:13.193 --> 03:14.820
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

03:14.861 --> 03:17.489
Excuse me, miss?
Miss?

03:17.530 --> 03:19.122
Miss?

03:19.165 --> 03:21.565
Fucking cunts.

03:21.601 --> 03:23.865
Are you laughing at me?

03:23.903 --> 03:25.495
No.

03:25.538 --> 03:27.301
Good.
Don't.

03:27.340 --> 03:30.138
I was just trying to help.
Are you okay?

03:30.176 --> 03:33.168
I'm fine.
I just need a drink.

03:33.213 --> 03:36.705
And a fucking aisle seat,
which they fucking had none.

03:38.952 --> 03:40.579
Sir, will you
switch with me?

03:40.620 --> 03:42.645
My pleasure.

03:43.790 --> 03:45.690
Thank you.
There you go.

03:47.393 --> 03:49.452
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

03:52.532 --> 03:55.126
I'm sorry if I seem rude.
I'm just...

03:55.168 --> 03:57.068
I'm Jamie.

03:57.103 --> 03:58.832
I know.

03:58.871 --> 04:00.930
I'm Turtle.
I love your work.

04:00.974 --> 04:02.805
Oh, thanks.

04:04.844 --> 04:06.402
You sure you're okay?

04:06.446 --> 04:07.936
Yeah, I'm fine.

04:07.981 --> 04:10.415
I just broke up
with my boyfriend.

04:10.450 --> 04:14.079
I don't want to talk about it.
I just want a drink.

04:14.120 --> 04:16.178
Let me get you one.
What do you need?

04:16.221 --> 04:18.087
Scotch.

04:18.124 --> 04:19.317
Watch this.

04:24.664 --> 04:26.791
Scotch.

04:28.268 --> 04:30.532
How about
we make it a double?

04:33.339 --> 04:35.830
- Thanks so much.
- You're welcome.

04:41.314 --> 04:43.942
Yo, love that you're sitting coach.
Very cool.

04:43.983 --> 04:46.008
Thanks, kid.

04:46.052 --> 04:47.644
How you doing, Drama?

04:47.687 --> 04:50.053
Not good.

04:50.089 --> 04:52.580
But I took two Vics,
so I will be.

05:05.238 --> 05:07.570
- Morning, Bradley
- Is it, Ari?

05:07.607 --> 05:09.734
What?

05:10.877 --> 05:12.936
What do you got, Lloyd?

05:12.979 --> 05:14.674
Lloyd?

05:14.714 --> 05:17.683
- Lloyd!
- Yes, Ari?

05:17.717 --> 05:20.379
What's wrong? Tom catch you cruising
for glory holes again?

05:20.420 --> 05:23.218
Joke all you want,
but you are the cheater now, Ari.

05:23.256 --> 05:25.781
- How was Geneva?
- Great. Went to Paris too.

05:25.825 --> 05:27.816
Sorry I didn't bring you back
a Toulouse-Lautrec dildo.

05:27.860 --> 05:30.590
- But you have me back.
- No, Benedict Arnold. I don't.

05:30.630 --> 05:32.154
When were you gonna
tell me about this?

05:32.198 --> 05:35.759
Oh, Jesus, Lloyd. You know "Variety"
is one step above "Us Weekly."

05:35.802 --> 05:38.669
Well, "Us Weekly"
didn't send this fax.

05:38.705 --> 05:40.002
What fax?

05:40.039 --> 05:42.974
A $10 million offer
from John Ellis.

05:43.009 --> 05:44.806
What do you
have to say now?

05:44.844 --> 05:47.540
I don't know
what to say.

05:54.053 --> 05:56.453
- Thank you.
- Oh, you're welcome.

05:56.489 --> 05:58.548
So it's cool
if I call you?

05:58.591 --> 06:00.320
Wait a couple of days.

06:01.427 --> 06:04.362
I'm kidding.
Yes, you can call me.

06:04.397 --> 06:06.558
What kind of world
am I living in?

06:06.599 --> 06:07.930
Turtle flies first

06:07.967 --> 06:10.629
and has airport farewell
scenes with Meadow Soprano.

06:10.670 --> 06:13.104
He has been over there
dragging out that goodbye for a while.

06:13.139 --> 06:14.538
Come on, they spent
five hours together.

06:14.574 --> 06:16.064
Maybe they struck up
a friendship.

06:16.109 --> 06:19.044
Whatever he struck up,
she should be sick of it by now.

06:19.078 --> 06:20.602
What are you doing, Drama?

06:20.646 --> 06:22.773
Just taking
precautionary measures.

06:22.815 --> 06:24.840
Economy class is a killer

06:24.884 --> 06:26.476
that counts the blood clot
as a friend.

06:26.519 --> 06:29.010
And you're gonna prevent one
by blowing yourself?

06:29.055 --> 06:30.352
Take it easy, guys.
Here comes Turtle.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.255
Yo.

06:32.291 --> 06:34.350
What the fuck
were you two talking about?

06:34.394 --> 06:36.385
A lot of stuff.
She is very cool.

06:36.429 --> 06:38.124
Really?
And she thought you were cool?

06:38.164 --> 06:40.724
I don't know, I guess.
You guys ready to roll?

06:40.767 --> 06:42.758
No no, don't do that.
Don't do that, Turtle.

06:42.802 --> 06:44.963
- Don't do what?
- See what he's doing?

06:45.004 --> 06:46.699
- Oh, I totally see what he's doing.
- What's he doing?

06:46.739 --> 06:47.967
I'm not doing anything.

06:48.007 --> 06:50.635
He's being coy
as if he's got a shot.

06:50.676 --> 06:53.839
- Did you get her number?
- Home and cell.

06:53.880 --> 06:55.609
Well, maybe he does
have a shot.

06:55.648 --> 06:57.411
- Ha ha ha!
- I'm with Drama.

06:57.450 --> 06:59.008
Is it that ridiculous?

06:59.051 --> 07:01.679
You fucking a Martian
is less ridiculous, put it that way.

07:01.721 --> 07:03.621
- You guys are mean.
- Really mean.

07:03.656 --> 07:05.954
Oh, poor little
Turtle's sensitive

07:05.992 --> 07:08.153
'cause he can't get
a hot famous actress.

07:08.194 --> 07:11.061
99% of the world's
average looking citizens

07:11.097 --> 07:13.031
can't get that, Turtle,
so don't feel bad.

07:13.065 --> 07:14.555
You're living
in a fantasy.

07:14.600 --> 07:16.568
Reality is
when he calls her

07:16.602 --> 07:19.264
she tries to lure him away
from Vince to be her bitch.

07:19.305 --> 07:22.399
Reality is what happened over the Pacific,
you angry old fuck.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.342
Yeah, and what's that?

07:25.812 --> 07:28.906
She jerked me off.
Happy?

07:28.948 --> 07:32.076
Liar.
Get back here, you liar.

07:35.455 --> 07:38.151
- Hello?
- E Murph, Josh Weinstein.

07:38.191 --> 07:39.681
Hey, Josh.
How you doing?

07:39.725 --> 07:42.159
I'm always doing great, E.
You know that.

07:42.195 --> 07:44.060
And while others may no longer
believe in Vince...

07:44.096 --> 07:46.064
Ari Gold... I still do.

07:46.098 --> 07:49.124
- Yeah, well he's still our agent, Josh.
- For the moment he is.

07:49.168 --> 07:52.729
But Ari will officially
become head studio fascist tomorrow.

07:52.772 --> 07:54.672
Let me show you what I can
do for you guys today.

07:54.707 --> 07:56.004
Oh yeah?
What can you do?

07:56.042 --> 07:58.067
Frank Darabont.

07:58.110 --> 07:59.907
- Vince a fan?
- Who isn't?

07:59.946 --> 08:02.506
Yeah, "Shawshank" almost makes
me wish I did prison time.

08:02.548 --> 08:05.108
Anyway, he's got a new
project he's working on.

08:05.151 --> 08:07.449
I got him to sit down
with Vince to talk about the lead.

08:07.487 --> 08:09.455
- Really?
- Really.

08:10.957 --> 08:12.151
10 million, Ari?

08:12.191 --> 08:14.625
You were hoping
for six or seven, tops.

08:14.660 --> 08:16.890
I know, baby. It's crazy.
They want me bad.

08:16.929 --> 08:19.693
And I keep sinking my own
money into this place.

08:19.732 --> 08:22.462
And for what?
A staff whose petty lives

08:22.502 --> 08:24.868
rise and fall with my successes
and their failures.

08:24.904 --> 08:26.428
- E's on the phone.
- Call him back.

08:26.472 --> 08:28.372
- Says it's urgent.
- I said I'll call him back.

08:28.407 --> 08:30.068
- Ari.
- Lloyd, I'm on the phone.

08:30.109 --> 08:31.940
I know, I put
the call through.

08:31.978 --> 08:34.275
I've been putting your calls
through for three years now,

08:34.313 --> 08:36.577
and I haven't interrupted
or given you my opinion,

08:36.616 --> 08:40.107
even when I know I can steer your
twisted mind into greener pastures.

08:40.152 --> 08:41.914
But I can't keep my mouth
shut anymore.

08:41.953 --> 08:43.818
- That's because it's filled with...
- Shut it, Ari.

08:43.856 --> 08:46.347
I know you're gonna make
some rude, inconsiderate,

08:46.392 --> 08:48.553
nasty comment about
my sexual orientation.

08:48.594 --> 08:52.291
And I know you always
do that to deflect from your insecurities.

08:52.331 --> 08:54.526
And I've lived with it
because I want to learn

08:54.567 --> 08:56.398
and I believed that someday
you would promote me.

08:56.435 --> 08:58.596
Lloyd, this is gonna be
a good thing for you as well.

08:58.638 --> 09:01.573
If you think working
for some conglomerate is gonna fulfill you,

09:01.607 --> 09:04.735
then fine, but please don't think
I'd ever make myself a corporate bitch.

09:04.777 --> 09:06.711
And by the way,
even if I did,

09:06.746 --> 09:08.771
your little gay quips
would not be tolerated

09:08.814 --> 09:10.679
in a publicly-
traded company.

09:10.716 --> 09:13.446
People need you
here, Ari.

09:14.887 --> 09:16.184
I'll leave you with that.

09:17.523 --> 09:19.514
You throw a lot of Jew guilt
for a Chinaman.

09:20.893 --> 09:22.360
He's got a point, Ari.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.260
No homosexual harassment?

09:24.297 --> 09:26.697
No, being your own boss.

09:26.732 --> 09:28.427
That's why you put up
with all the stress,

09:28.467 --> 09:30.435
because nobody can
tell you what to do.

09:30.469 --> 09:32.494
You always tell me
what to do.

09:32.538 --> 09:35.006
So tell me what to do.

09:35.041 --> 09:36.872
I can't decide this
for you, Ari.

09:36.909 --> 09:39.673
Like when I was trying to decide whether
or not to ask you to marry me,

09:39.712 --> 09:41.202
I'll let the fates decide.

09:41.247 --> 09:43.272
- How?
- By flipping a coin.

09:43.316 --> 09:45.546
You flipped a coin to decide
whether to marry me or not?

09:45.585 --> 09:47.519
I was joking, baby.

09:50.089 --> 09:52.523
Heads I leave,
tails I stay.

09:53.726 --> 09:55.318
Well?

09:56.696 --> 09:59.187
Two out of three.

09:59.231 --> 10:00.926
I feel like we're
cheating on Ari.

10:00.967 --> 10:02.992
Well, the guy won't call
us back, what are we supposed to do?

10:03.035 --> 10:05.629
Take care of yourself.
It's what everyone else in this town does.

10:05.671 --> 10:09.232
Except you, who gets taken care
of by Meadow Soprano.

10:09.275 --> 10:11.470
Come on, Johnny,
leave him alone already.

10:11.510 --> 10:14.741
No can do, bro.
He made a statement and I want it verified.

10:14.780 --> 10:16.270
How you gonna
verify it, Drama?

10:16.315 --> 10:18.909
I got a friend...
an FBI friend who will come down here

10:18.951 --> 10:20.942
and administer
a lie detector test.

10:20.987 --> 10:22.648
I'm not taking
a lie detector test.

10:22.688 --> 10:25.486
How about if we get him on
that "Moment of Truth" show?

10:25.524 --> 10:28.288
- Yeah, at least then he'd make a buck.
- Not if he keeps lying.

10:28.327 --> 10:30.921
I'm not doing anything to prove anything
to you guys, understood?

10:30.963 --> 10:32.760
You guys need anything?

10:32.798 --> 10:35.266
Well, this guy got jerked off by
Meadow Soprano,

10:35.301 --> 10:38.327
so he's all good.
I'll take an iced tea.

10:38.371 --> 10:40.737
I don't think he
believes you either.

10:40.773 --> 10:43.003
We're all right, thanks.
Here comes Josh with Frank.

10:43.042 --> 10:45.442
- Wish us luck.
- Good luck.

10:45.478 --> 10:47.378
- Frank.
- Vince.

10:47.413 --> 10:49.779
- I'm a big fan.
- Hey, likewise. A great pleasure.

10:49.815 --> 10:51.942
- Hey, Josh, what's up?
- Eric Murphy.

10:51.984 --> 10:54.179
- Let's sit, shall we?
- Absolutely.

10:54.220 --> 10:55.983
- Gentlemen. Frank.
- Got us a table up here.

10:56.022 --> 10:57.489
Hey, Frank.

10:59.325 --> 11:01.020
Loser.

11:01.060 --> 11:02.618
Vinnie, E Murph.

11:02.662 --> 11:05.825
So how long have you
and Josh been working together?

11:05.865 --> 11:08.698
- Oh, we don't work together.
- Not yet.

11:08.734 --> 11:11.100
Josh's dad and I are old friends.
We go way back.

11:11.137 --> 11:13.401
Anyway, he told me that
you guys are good friends.

11:13.439 --> 11:15.464
He suggested we sit down.
I said fantastic.

11:15.508 --> 11:16.873
Yeah, absolutely.

11:16.909 --> 11:18.934
So you have a new movie
you're getting ready to start?

11:18.978 --> 11:21.913
Yes, yeah. I got this thing called
"School of Athens."

11:21.947 --> 11:24.609
It's based on the Renaissance
masterpiece by Rafael.

11:24.650 --> 11:26.413
It's in the Vatican Palace,
blah blah blah.

11:26.452 --> 11:29.910
Anyway, the really cool
thing is we get to shoot for 14 weeks

11:29.955 --> 11:32.890
in the Greek Islands.

11:32.925 --> 11:35.621
- Wow, that sounds amazing.
- How nice is that?

11:35.661 --> 11:38.027
So what's the part
you had in mind for me?

11:38.064 --> 11:39.554
In this, you mean?

11:39.598 --> 11:42.066
Josh, didn't you tell him
what I was thinking here?

11:42.101 --> 11:44.126
Well, I...

11:45.471 --> 11:47.496
Vince, look,

11:47.540 --> 11:50.941
I'm afraid that there's nothing in this
particular film for you.

11:50.976 --> 11:53.638
There are no male roles
in it under 45.

11:53.679 --> 11:56.239
Oh, I thought Josh said
you wanted to talk to me about the lead.

11:56.282 --> 11:58.477
Yes, the lead
in a TV series

11:58.517 --> 12:00.576
Frank is exec producing.

12:00.619 --> 12:02.246
And you didn't
tell them this?

12:02.288 --> 12:04.051
No, he didn't tell us
anything, Frank.

12:04.090 --> 12:05.887
That's 'cause
he's a scumbag.

12:05.925 --> 12:08.325
Just like your old man, aren't you, Josh?
Good work.

12:08.360 --> 12:10.260
Guys, I'm really sorry.

12:10.296 --> 12:12.821
Your clients
keep calling, Ari.

12:12.865 --> 12:15.095
- Can't stall forever.
- Tell them I'll call them back.

12:15.134 --> 12:16.795
You've grown cold,
Ari Gold.

12:16.836 --> 12:18.997
I've got something
that might warm him up.

12:19.038 --> 12:20.733
You cougarlicious
little freak.

12:20.773 --> 12:23.571
Just so you know,
I'm paying 10¢ on the dollar

12:23.609 --> 12:25.042
for your share
of this company.

12:25.077 --> 12:27.705
- Dana Gordon's on one.
- Put her through.

12:27.747 --> 12:29.840
Any shot you could
pay me in euros?

12:29.882 --> 12:33.249
You are a fucking asshole.

12:33.285 --> 12:36.379
How can I leave
such a charming man?

12:36.422 --> 12:38.447
Dana Gordon.

12:38.491 --> 12:40.015
Am I your number two
or not, Ari?

12:40.059 --> 12:42.118
You'll always be my
number one whore, Dana.

12:42.161 --> 12:44.629
- Oh, thank you.
- Just not sure it's gonna be at the studio.

12:44.663 --> 12:48.258
You piece of shit.
Look, you know I can do that job.

12:48.300 --> 12:50.768
Just relax. I'm struggling with
this decision,

12:50.803 --> 12:52.600
but I think I'm not
gonna take the job.

12:52.638 --> 12:54.230
Whoopee!

12:54.273 --> 12:56.639
But don't worry, Dana.
I'm sure you'll be able

12:56.675 --> 12:59.644
to grease the balls of the next guy in line
and get yourself under him.

12:59.678 --> 13:01.737
There is no next guy.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.840
There's a next girl.

13:03.883 --> 13:06.784
Amanda Daniels.
Doesn't she hate you?

13:06.819 --> 13:08.480
That should work out well
for you and yours.

13:08.521 --> 13:11.183
- Fuck me.
- I'll second that.

13:12.458 --> 13:13.982
I'm so happy, Ari.

13:14.026 --> 13:16.426
You've made me vary happy.
I hope you're happy too.

13:16.462 --> 13:18.726
- Do I look happy!?
- What's wrong?

13:18.764 --> 13:20.629
Has so much come been
squirted into those eyes

13:20.666 --> 13:22.361
you can't see what's
right in front of your face?

13:22.401 --> 13:25.370
Amanda Daniels takes that job,
Vince is fucked and I'm fucked.

13:25.404 --> 13:26.769
Which means
we're all fucked.

13:26.806 --> 13:29.502
And we're fucked in the way
you like to get fucked.

13:29.542 --> 13:32.102
Not fucked in the way
that normal people like to get fucked.

13:32.144 --> 13:33.941
So what are you
gonna do now?

13:33.979 --> 13:35.913
I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

13:35.948 --> 13:37.711
Not a word
to anyone, Lloyd.

13:42.721 --> 13:44.382
This is not TV, Vince.

13:44.423 --> 13:45.856
Oh no?
What is it?

13:45.891 --> 13:48.121
It's TV
with Frank Darabont.

13:48.160 --> 13:50.822
Know what, Josh? Sandbagging us
like that was a real dick move.

13:50.863 --> 13:53.593
I thought it would be more impactful
if you heard it straight from Frank.

13:53.632 --> 13:55.463
What the hell's so wrong
with doing TV?

13:55.501 --> 13:57.696
Nothing for David
Hasselhoff or for you.

13:57.736 --> 13:59.670
But for Vince, doing TV
is ridiculous.

13:59.705 --> 14:01.502
Yeah, but you doing
Jamie-Lynn Sigler isn't?

14:01.540 --> 14:03.804
- Oh, here we go.
- You did Jamie-Lynn Sigler?

14:03.843 --> 14:06.607
- Yeah, you believe it?
- Not really.

14:06.645 --> 14:08.340
Nobody does.

14:08.380 --> 14:09.711
It's been a pleasure
as always, Josh.

14:09.748 --> 14:11.045
Wait a minute.
Just hold on a second.

14:11.083 --> 14:12.414
At least read the script.

14:12.451 --> 14:14.646
It's Frank Darabont.
He's a genius.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.655
Vince, there's lots
and lots of money in TV.

14:16.689 --> 14:19.180
I don't want to get stuck playing
the same character for the next five years.

14:19.225 --> 14:21.318
- I want to do movies.
- He's still a movie star, you know?

14:21.360 --> 14:24.193
Lots of movie stars do TV.
George Clooney did "ER" for Christ sakes.

14:24.230 --> 14:26.130
That was before
he was George Clooney.

14:26.165 --> 14:28.463
No one goes backwards
'cause you don't get back to movies.

14:28.500 --> 14:30.764
You didn't see Leo in
the "Growing Pains" reunion.

14:30.803 --> 14:32.998
Well, maybe it's time for you to think
about that part of your life being over.

14:33.038 --> 14:35.233
Maybe you're not gonna be
a movie star anymore.

14:38.010 --> 14:39.841
Look, guys, I'm sorry.

14:39.879 --> 14:42.677
I'm just telling you what nobody else
in this town has the balls to.

14:42.715 --> 14:45.946
Why don't you walk away, Josh?
Walk away.

14:47.853 --> 14:49.980
All right, man.
Take it easy.

14:53.859 --> 14:55.656
My car is over there.

14:59.865 --> 15:01.833
No no, Mr. Gold.
No.

15:01.867 --> 15:03.732
It's okay.

15:03.769 --> 15:06.329
Five minutes, Ari.
Not a second more.

15:06.372 --> 15:08.772
No need to be snippy, Amanda.
I'm here for you, not me.

15:08.807 --> 15:11.332
- Really?
- Well, I'm here for us really.

15:11.377 --> 15:14.403
- I'd rather suck a rabid dog's dick.
- Clever, but seriously.

15:14.446 --> 15:17.074
Seriously, Ari, what about us would you
like to talk about?

15:17.116 --> 15:18.674
I'd like to
bury the hatchet.

15:18.717 --> 15:20.947
The animosity between the two
of us has run its course.

15:20.986 --> 15:23.750
Apology accepted.
What else?

15:23.789 --> 15:26.257
All business,
it's admirable how you do it.

15:26.292 --> 15:29.261
That's why I'm putting all my support
behind you for the studio head job.

15:29.295 --> 15:31.195
I don't need your support.

15:31.230 --> 15:33.425
That may be true, but you're gonna
need me to bow out of the race.

15:33.465 --> 15:35.626
Ari, I have never needed

15:35.668 --> 15:37.465
and will never need
anything from you.

15:37.503 --> 15:40.529
Amanda, it's very simple.
You want this job,

15:40.572 --> 15:42.437
I want Vince
in "Smokejumpers."

15:42.474 --> 15:44.465
I don't think
he's good enough.

15:44.510 --> 15:47.502
- You did represent him at one point.
- Yeah, and now I don't.

15:47.546 --> 15:49.912
Bitterness is not
very becoming.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.348
Neither is groveling,
and I'm not bitter.

15:51.383 --> 15:53.442
But I'm not
making deals with you.

15:53.485 --> 15:55.282
Then unfortunately I'm gonna
have to stand in your way.

15:55.321 --> 15:57.585
If you wanted this job
you would have taken it.

15:57.623 --> 16:00.456
But we both know you won't because
you'll miss your little clients too much.

16:00.492 --> 16:03.017
And we both know that you've
already fucked all of yours.

16:03.062 --> 16:05.360
So maybe you could move on
to bigger and better.

16:05.397 --> 16:06.989
Look, you're gonna have to
find another way to bring

16:07.032 --> 16:09.466
your once-upon-a-time-
movie-star client back from the dead.

16:09.501 --> 16:11.628
- Not bitter, huh?
- Fuck you, Ari.

16:11.670 --> 16:14.537
You can kiss your relationship with
that studio goodbye.

16:14.573 --> 16:17.406
No no, you can kiss
your motherfucking dream job goodbye.

16:17.443 --> 16:19.434
'Cause you're right,
I didn't want this job.

16:19.478 --> 16:22.345
But now I'm gonna take it
just to spite you.

16:24.049 --> 16:26.381
Lloyd.
Yeah, call John Ellis.

16:26.418 --> 16:29.012
Tell him I'm gonna close
this motherfucking deal.

16:31.090 --> 16:33.615
Let's not let Josh Weinstein
get us upset.

16:33.659 --> 16:35.820
He didn't get me upset.
Frank Darabont did.

16:35.861 --> 16:38.625
An Academy Award nominee
thinks I should do TV.

16:38.664 --> 16:40.291
He didn't say he thinks
you should do TV.

16:40.332 --> 16:42.027
He said you'd be great
for his TV show

16:42.067 --> 16:43.932
if he can get you,
which he can't.

16:43.969 --> 16:46.164
- That's a good point.
- Thanks, E.

16:46.205 --> 16:48.639
I just wish I know what Ari was doing.
If he takes the job, what?

16:48.674 --> 16:50.972
We got to work with a guy
like Josh Weinstein?

16:51.010 --> 16:53.274
If Ari takes the studio job
you got "Smokejumpers."

16:53.312 --> 16:55.746
And once you kill it in that, you'll be back
and bigger than ever.

16:55.781 --> 16:57.112
That's another
good point, Turtle.

16:57.149 --> 16:59.617
Yeah, thanks again.
I feel extra smart today.

16:59.651 --> 17:02.745
Yeah, well, maybe that's 'cause you
unloaded a ton of bullshit earlier.

17:02.788 --> 17:04.346
But there is a problem
with the thought.

17:04.390 --> 17:05.686
What's that?

17:05.723 --> 17:07.749
What if Ari doesn't
give you the gig?

17:07.792 --> 17:10.489
- You think he wouldn't?
- He's an agent.

17:10.529 --> 17:12.258
Nothing would surprise me.

17:12.297 --> 17:13.888
And when he goes
from seller to buyer,

17:13.932 --> 17:16.025
he's gonna start analyzing
all sorts of new angles.

17:16.068 --> 17:17.797
You're really making us all
feel good today, huh?

17:17.836 --> 17:19.428
Just keeping it real.

17:19.471 --> 17:21.336
- Sorry, bro.
- Call Ari.

17:21.373 --> 17:22.964
I already left him
like five messages.

17:23.008 --> 17:25.135
We'll have to
ambush him then.

17:35.954 --> 17:38.149
- Ari.
- John.

17:41.393 --> 17:44.328
So you ready to become
part of all this?

17:44.363 --> 17:46.092
Oh, I'm ready.

17:58.377 --> 18:00.368
You look awful, Lloyd.

18:00.412 --> 18:02.539
I feel awful, E.

18:02.581 --> 18:05.106
- So it's official?
- He's signing the papers now.

18:05.150 --> 18:08.381
I'm sorry, Vince. I'm supposed to exude
confidence to clients,

18:08.420 --> 18:11.184
but I just can't.
All I can do is shake and cry.

18:11.223 --> 18:13.418
How about if I tell you
something funny

18:13.459 --> 18:16.223
- to cheer you up, Lloyd?
- You can try.

18:16.261 --> 18:19.128
Turtle got jerked off by Jamie-Lynn Sigler
on the plane today.

18:19.164 --> 18:20.927
Get the fuck out of here.

18:20.966 --> 18:23.230
- Made you laugh.
- Boys!

18:23.268 --> 18:24.895
This is a surprise.

18:24.937 --> 18:26.962
I guess this is congrats.

18:27.005 --> 18:29.872
- Wow, you sold me out.
- Oh, go ahead and be mad.

18:29.908 --> 18:32.274
But I've grown four new
ulcers keeping your secret.

18:32.311 --> 18:33.869
Come on in, guys.

18:36.181 --> 18:37.978
Ahem.

18:38.016 --> 18:39.643
I apologize for
the disappearance.

18:39.685 --> 18:41.949
It's been a tough day
of soul searching for me though.

18:41.987 --> 18:44.319
Been a tough day for Vince too.
He got offered a TV show today.

18:44.356 --> 18:46.688
Offered TV by who?
Not by my people.

18:46.725 --> 18:48.693
Frank Darabont.
Josh Weinstein set it up.

18:48.727 --> 18:50.388
Weinstein?
Why are you guys talking to Weinstein?

18:50.429 --> 18:52.397
He called. We couldn't find you
so we took the meeting.

18:52.431 --> 18:54.365
Wow, you guys really
are melting down.

18:54.399 --> 18:57.027
Yeah, maybe we are.
So just tell us, as studio head,

18:57.069 --> 18:58.536
are you gonna put me in
"Smokejumpers" or not?

18:58.570 --> 19:01.232
Did you ever think
there was a possibility that I wouldn't?

19:01.273 --> 19:02.797
I just want to get my life
back on track.

19:02.841 --> 19:06.242
I know that, Vinnie.
But I didn't take the job.

19:06.278 --> 19:08.872
- Double whoopee!
- He's happy.

19:08.914 --> 19:10.643
- You didn't take it?
- No, I'm still your agent.

19:10.682 --> 19:14.379
Are you guys happy or is the movie more
important to you than me?

19:14.419 --> 19:16.387
Of course we're happy.
But what now?

19:16.421 --> 19:18.116
- We're gonna be all right.
- How?

19:18.157 --> 19:19.818
- Things are coming.
- What things?

19:19.858 --> 19:21.849
Dana Gordon on one.

19:21.894 --> 19:23.293
Put her through.

19:25.797 --> 19:27.230
Dana Gordon!

19:27.266 --> 19:29.564
Ari, I love you.

19:29.601 --> 19:32.729
And I swear, I'll rub
your cock like it's 1990.

19:32.771 --> 19:35.501
Whoa whoa whoa, Dana.
You're on speaker. I got Vince and E here.

19:35.541 --> 19:37.771
- Jesus Christ.
- Hi, Dana.

19:37.809 --> 19:39.902
We all wanted to be in the room
to celebrate together.

19:39.945 --> 19:41.435
Celebrate what?

19:41.480 --> 19:43.846
Boys, you are talking to
the new head of the studio.

19:43.882 --> 19:46.442
Madam President,
what's your first order of business?

19:46.485 --> 19:48.680
"Smokejumpers," Vince.
You're in.

19:48.720 --> 19:51.484
- You're kidding me.
- And she's gonna pay you your quote.

19:51.523 --> 19:53.957
- It's the second lead.
- You're gonna pay him his quote

19:53.992 --> 19:57.257
or Vincent Chase is going
to announce on "TMZ"

19:57.296 --> 20:00.595
that the new head of the studio calls
agencies and offers up handjobs.

20:00.632 --> 20:01.963
All right, enough, Ari.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.991
Vince, I will take
good care of you.

20:04.036 --> 20:05.799
- Thank you!
- Thank you, Dana.

20:05.837 --> 20:09.204
- I love you, Dana.
- I love you too, Ari. For real this time.

20:09.241 --> 20:11.766
- I'll call you later about that tug.
- Goodbye.

20:11.810 --> 20:13.175
- How the hell?
- What happened?

20:13.212 --> 20:15.009
I pulled off the old
bait and switch.

20:15.047 --> 20:16.776
They wanted
your old friend Amanda,

20:16.815 --> 20:19.010
and I gave them
my old friend Dana.

20:19.051 --> 20:20.780
Everybody wins.
Boom!

20:20.819 --> 20:22.719
Wow.
That's impressive, Ari.

20:22.754 --> 20:24.312
This is really big for you, Vinnie.
Really big.

20:24.356 --> 20:25.823
I want you
to kill this movie.

20:25.857 --> 20:27.848
- I'll do my best.
- I know you will.

20:27.893 --> 20:29.292
All right!

20:29.328 --> 20:31.353
- Can I come?
- Of course you can.

20:35.100 --> 20:37.660
All right, to things
being back on track.

20:37.703 --> 20:39.330
- I hear that.
- Hear hear.

20:39.371 --> 20:41.805
You know, Ari, now that
things are back on track

20:41.840 --> 20:43.569
can we talk about
my promotion?

20:43.609 --> 20:45.736
You know what, Lloyd?
I want to learn Chinese first

20:45.777 --> 20:47.574
so I can give it to you
in your native tongue.

20:47.613 --> 20:49.604
- Ari.
- Listen, we're here to celebrate Vince.

20:49.648 --> 20:51.047
All right?
Please, Lloyd.

20:51.083 --> 20:52.744
Hey, cheers.

20:52.784 --> 20:55.378
- I don't believe it.
- What?

20:56.622 --> 20:58.112
Your girlfriend is here.

20:59.124 --> 21:00.751
Don't embarrass me.

21:00.792 --> 21:02.259
How does he know Jamie?

21:02.294 --> 21:04.319
Oh, he claims she jerked
him on the plane today.

21:04.363 --> 21:06.194
Oh yeah yeah.
I'm sure she's got a fetish

21:06.231 --> 21:08.495
for guys who are built like
a "South Park" character.

21:10.068 --> 21:11.797
Hey, Jamie.
What's going...

21:11.837 --> 21:13.702
That's for running around
town telling everyone

21:13.739 --> 21:16.139
I jerked you off,
you fat little fuck.

21:19.177 --> 21:20.542
Thanks a lot, Drama.

21:24.616 --> 21:26.777
Jamie-Lynn,
wait wait wait.

21:26.818 --> 21:28.843
Look, I'm sorry.

21:28.887 --> 21:31.549
Turtle didn't do anything.
It was me.

21:31.590 --> 21:34.354
I was busting his chops
today about you

21:34.393 --> 21:36.190
and I shot my mouth off
in a restaurant.

21:36.228 --> 21:37.923
Well, he obviously
told you.

21:37.963 --> 21:39.624
No, I made it up.

21:39.665 --> 21:41.826
Turtle didn't do anything.
He's totally innocent.

21:41.867 --> 21:43.858
That's nice of you to try
and cover for your friend.

21:43.902 --> 21:46.598
But the fact is
I jerked him off and he told you.

21:46.638 --> 21:49.004
I actually liked him
and would have fucked him too

21:49.041 --> 21:51.009
if he would have
kept his mouth shut.

22:00.986 --> 22:02.317
What happened?

22:02.354 --> 22:04.754
Turtle, I am
so sorry, man.

22:04.790 --> 22:06.883
She actually liked you.

22:06.925 --> 22:08.950
- Really?
- No way.

22:08.994 --> 22:10.086
- Sorry, Turtle.
- Sorry, Turtle.

22:10.128 --> 22:12.096
Well, at least order
has been restored.

22:12.130 --> 22:13.927
Everything's back
to normal.

22:13.965 --> 22:16.331
Baby bro is a movie star,

22:16.368 --> 22:18.336
Ari is his agent

22:18.370 --> 22:21.168
and Turtle is
once again pussyless.

22:21.206 --> 22:23.936
Glasses up.

22:23.975 --> 22:25.943
Did she really say
she liked me?

22:25.977 --> 22:28.172
Oh yeah.
She would have fucked you too.

22:28.213 --> 22:30.511
At least you got
a nice jerk, huh?
