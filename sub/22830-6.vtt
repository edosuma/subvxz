39:19.106 --> 39:20.983
{\an1}Now, who started a bet
saying you would get her

39:21.067 --> 39:22.276
over Jeremiah?

39:22.359 --> 39:23.611
What are you
talking about?

39:23.694 --> 39:26.238
{\an1}I don't know, one of the boys
came up to me saying

39:26.322 --> 39:29.325
{\an1}somebody had a bet going
of who would get her first.

39:29.408 --> 39:31.368
Ain't nobody had
any bet going on.

39:31.452 --> 39:32.912
I will swear on my life
right now

39:32.995 --> 39:35.623
that nobody
had that (bleep) at all.

39:35.706 --> 39:39.001
{\an1}Hey, did we have any
kind of bet on that at all?

39:39.085 --> 39:40.252
I didn't have any bet
on anything.

39:40.336 --> 39:41.170
{\an5}That's what I'm saying--

39:40.336 --> 39:41.170
What did you say, though?

39:41.253 --> 39:42.463
I haven't said anything.

39:42.546 --> 39:45.216
(Jeremiah)
I'm pissed right now.

39:45.299 --> 39:46.509
I really am.

39:46.592 --> 39:49.261
{\an8}Somebody said
that me and Gus have a bet

39:49.345 --> 39:50.638
{\an8}who would win
Katrina over.

39:50.721 --> 39:54.016
Somebody is messing with me
for whatever reasons,

39:54.100 --> 39:55.976
and right now,
I'm thinking it's Gus.

39:56.060 --> 39:58.229
Oh, (bleep).

39:58.312 --> 40:00.773
I think they heard
about Gus starting a bet.

40:00.856 --> 40:02.066
Didn't nobody
start no bet.

40:02.149 --> 40:03.359
I mean, we were just
talking about it.

40:03.442 --> 40:05.152
Codi, you, you said it.

40:05.236 --> 40:07.321
{\an5}I did not mean it like that.
I swear to God.
Oh.

40:07.404 --> 40:09.907
When I say "bet,"
like, I don't mean

40:09.990 --> 40:11.909
{\an4}like a actual bet
where there's money involved.

40:09.990 --> 40:11.909
{\an3}Okay.

40:11.992 --> 40:14.829
{\an8}(Codi)
At this point, Nilsa's
just being gossip queen.

40:14.912 --> 40:17.414
{\an8}Like she is right there
in the middle of the pot

40:17.498 --> 40:19.667
{\an8}stirring it up,
mixing it up,

40:19.750 --> 40:22.837
and now I realize
that you can't

40:22.920 --> 40:26.966
really talk to females
about guy talk.

40:27.049 --> 40:29.343
{\an1}Who told her that there was
a bet between you guys?

40:29.426 --> 40:30.344
{\an1}Like, why would you
say that?

40:30.427 --> 40:31.679
I have no--
I have no idea.

40:31.762 --> 40:32.847
Like I said, I'm just
trying to figure--

40:32.930 --> 40:33.681
I'm trying to figure out
what's going on.

40:33.764 --> 40:35.432
{\an8}I feel like there's a snake

40:35.516 --> 40:36.892
{\an8}slithering around
the grass at this point.

40:36.976 --> 40:38.227
{\an8}Someone's just
not being truthful.

40:38.310 --> 40:39.061
{\an8}Nothing to do with it.

40:39.145 --> 40:40.521
{\an7}I don't know
who started what,

40:40.604 --> 40:43.315
{\an8}but I specifically--

40:40.604 --> 40:43.315
{\an9}(sobbing)

40:43.399 --> 40:45.693
{\an8}What did you say to her?

40:43.399 --> 40:45.693
{\an8}I didn't say (bleep) to her.

40:45.776 --> 40:47.027
{\an7}You said nothing.
That's why she ran off?

40:47.111 --> 40:50.322
{\an7}You really think I would
talk (bleep) about you to her?

40:50.406 --> 40:51.782
{\an7}I'm not saying you're
talking (bleep) about me,

40:51.866 --> 40:53.367
{\an8}but you clearly
said something.

40:53.451 --> 40:55.161
{\an8}Oh, my blood
is boiling right now.

40:55.244 --> 40:56.120
{\an8}I don't want any girl

40:56.203 --> 40:57.538
{\an7}to be (bleep) hurt
by this bull(bleep).

40:57.621 --> 40:58.706
{\an8}I don't either!

40:58.789 --> 41:01.208
{\an8}This guy is
literally two seconds away

41:01.292 --> 41:02.334
{\an8}from being destroyed
right now.

41:02.418 --> 41:03.752
{\an7}I don't know
what to think right now,

41:03.836 --> 41:05.171
{\an8}because right now
some girl's crying

41:05.254 --> 41:07.590
{\an8}and I don't know why.

41:07.673 --> 41:08.549
{\an8}So what happened?

41:08.632 --> 41:09.884
{\an7}How did she find out
about the bet?

41:09.967 --> 41:11.051
{\an8}I don't know.

41:11.135 --> 41:13.179
{\an8}But there's no (bleep)--
there's no (bleep) bet.

41:13.262 --> 41:20.519
♪♪

41:20.603 --> 41:21.520
{\an8}(Jeremiah)
Next time

41:21.604 --> 41:23.189
{\an8}on "MTV Floribama Shore..."

41:23.272 --> 41:26.150
{\an7}So, Nilsa, I-- I really probably
don't wanna go on this date.

41:26.233 --> 41:27.359
{\an8}What the (bleep)?

41:27.443 --> 41:28.777
{\an8}Beach house.

41:30.112 --> 41:31.739
{\an8}Oh, no.

41:31.822 --> 41:33.824
{\an8}(sobbing)

41:33.908 --> 41:35.284
{\an8}Bitch, shut the (bleep) up!

41:35.367 --> 41:36.243
{\an8}You don't throw (bleep)
at me like that.

41:36.327 --> 41:37.620
{\an7}No, you don't
talk to me like that.

41:37.703 --> 41:38.621
{\an8}You're not gonna throw--

41:37.703 --> 41:38.621
{\an9}Hey!
