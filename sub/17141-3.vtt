00:05.714 --> 00:07.633
Hey, guys.
It's me, Miranda.

00:07.716 --> 00:11.011
Just wanna let you know that even though
you're all a bunch of haters,

00:11.094 --> 00:13.597
I'm not gonna let that stop me
from pursuing my dreams.

00:13.681 --> 00:15.182
You're all just jealous.

00:15.265 --> 00:18.561
So, haters, you can just back off!

00:18.644 --> 00:21.897
So, I'm gonna sing "Respect"
by Aretha Franklin,

00:21.980 --> 00:24.608
'cause I wanna show the haters
that they need to show some respect.

00:24.692 --> 00:26.068
'Cause they do.

00:26.151 --> 00:28.862
So... [sniffs]
all you haters listen up,

00:28.946 --> 00:30.656
'cause this one's for you.

-That's how the models do it.
-Mmm.

01:09.820 --> 01:11.446
[pops lips] How's it look?

01:11.529 --> 01:13.115
[pops lips] Amazing.

01:13.198 --> 01:14.950
Um, I see you're back on the Internet.

01:15.033 --> 01:17.661
Yeah, it's only fair to my fans.
I have to follow my heart.

01:17.745 --> 01:20.706
Okay, well, I watched your video
and it kind of gave me an idea--

01:20.789 --> 01:23.208
All right, Emily, let me stop you there.
You can't be in it.

01:23.291 --> 01:25.543
You're not gonna be in it, Emily.
Sorry.

01:25.628 --> 01:27.462
That's too bad.
But listen, Miranda,

01:27.545 --> 01:30.423
remember how you used to sing "Danny Boy"
for Aunty Moira every Sunday?

01:30.507 --> 01:31.759
Who's Aunty Moira?

01:31.842 --> 01:33.927
Are you serious?
She's, like, our favorite aunt.

01:34.011 --> 01:35.804
Oh, I'm pretty sure she's dead.

01:37.180 --> 01:39.349
No, she's not dead.
I saw her yesterday.

01:39.432 --> 01:40.768
She was very much alive.

01:40.851 --> 01:44.521
I'm gonna have to side with Miranda here.
She's dead.

01:44.604 --> 01:45.605
Yeah, definitely dead.

01:45.689 --> 01:46.774
Are you sure she wasn't dead?

01:46.857 --> 01:49.526
Anyway, her dementia's been getting worse
every time I've gone to see her.

01:49.610 --> 01:53.947
And I was just thinking,
hoping, that you would come and sing,

01:54.031 --> 01:56.574
and something might spark for her memory.

01:56.659 --> 01:58.368
[groans] I don't want to.

01:58.451 --> 02:01.830
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa.
How much does this gig pay?

02:01.914 --> 02:04.207
Oh, good thinking, Manager.

02:04.291 --> 02:06.084
It doesn't pay anything.

02:07.670 --> 02:11.048
Well, I would say a gig that pays nothing
is something we should pass on.

02:11.131 --> 02:12.590
Yeah, I definitely agree with that.

02:12.675 --> 02:16.011
No, it's not a gig.
It's just a good deed for a sick person.

02:16.094 --> 02:18.806
Emily, my... my little nugget.

02:18.889 --> 02:23.601
I see how painful this is for you,
and believe me, I know pain.

02:23.686 --> 02:26.271
So, clearly, you need to stop
going to the nursing home.

02:26.354 --> 02:29.357
[chuckles] I mean,
if something's depressing, don't do it!

02:29.441 --> 02:30.984
Yeah! Just don't do it.
Don't go!

02:31.068 --> 02:32.152
[Jim] Does that...

02:32.235 --> 02:33.445
Does that make sense, Emily?

02:33.528 --> 02:35.739
Just stop going to the nursing home.

02:35.823 --> 02:41.078
You know, it just occurred to me
that Emily brought up an important point.

02:41.161 --> 02:45.540
You should visit older family members
because some day they won't be around.

02:45.623 --> 02:48.543
And you don't wanna wake up one morning
and realize that you...

02:48.626 --> 02:51.046
never got the chance...

02:51.129 --> 02:52.547
to get all their stuff.

02:52.630 --> 02:54.632
[sighs] That's a good point.

02:54.717 --> 02:56.468
Emily doesn't even care about stuff.

02:56.551 --> 02:59.054
No, I care about stuff.
Hello?

03:26.081 --> 03:27.958
Sorry. [groans]

03:28.041 --> 03:29.960
I didn't get much sleep last night.

03:38.301 --> 03:39.386
Thank you.

03:41.847 --> 03:43.265
[slurping] Mmm.

03:43.348 --> 03:45.558
I saw you leave the church with Owen.

03:45.642 --> 03:46.894
[Miranda] Oh, yeah.

03:46.977 --> 03:49.187
A lot happened after that.

03:49.271 --> 03:51.231
It was a crazy night.
[chuckles]

03:51.314 --> 03:53.525
But I had a long talk
with Uncle Jim about everything,

03:53.608 --> 03:55.360
and I've decided to follow my heart.

03:56.361 --> 03:58.696
Sounds like things are pretty serious.

03:59.656 --> 04:01.074
Extremely.

04:02.034 --> 04:03.076
[Patrick] Well... [scoffs]

I'm happy for you.

could just be supportive of me, Patrick.

Yeah. 20 years, actually.

04:40.572 --> 04:42.199
God, you're a captivating woman.

04:44.076 --> 04:45.869
Thank you. [chuckles]

04:47.370 --> 04:48.997
Do you have your loyalty card?

04:49.081 --> 04:51.291
I don't need a card to prove my loyalty.

04:51.374 --> 04:52.417
[both chuckle]

04:53.501 --> 04:54.752
But I do have a card.

04:54.837 --> 04:56.754
I need that discount.
[clears throat] All right.

04:56.839 --> 04:58.715
'Cause I can't give you
the discount without it.

04:58.799 --> 05:00.383
-'Cause it's against the law.
-[chuckles] Yeah.

05:15.148 --> 05:17.775
And then you can use the burn cream...
for your fire accident, okay.

05:17.860 --> 05:19.277
Right. Right, you get it.
Right. Get it?

05:19.361 --> 05:20.988
You know, Bethany...

05:22.364 --> 05:25.617
I've been recently promoted to
executive director of church operations.

05:25.700 --> 05:28.036
-Oh.
-All of which is to say...

05:28.954 --> 05:31.123
I think we should go out sometime,

to date anymore, you know.

Hi, Carla.
How's Aunty Moira doing?

Oh, I'm sorry, Emily.
Same.

06:33.518 --> 06:35.270
[Miranda] What's that smell?

06:35.353 --> 06:38.523
Smells like the inside of a leg cast.
Can you make that stop?

06:38.606 --> 06:39.899
[Emily] I'm sorry.
She's with me.

06:39.983 --> 06:41.068
Miranda, please.

06:41.151 --> 06:42.360
Miranda, don't be rude.

06:42.444 --> 06:45.530
You have to understand,
this is how old people smell in groups.

06:45.614 --> 06:48.533
You're just gonna need to breathe
through your mouth like... [gasps]

06:49.492 --> 06:51.328
-Nope, I can taste it.
-[Emily] Okay.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.121
All right, we're going in.
We're going in.

06:53.205 --> 06:54.581
[whispers] I'm sorry.

Am I Bob Hamburg,
the famous movie director?

07:15.227 --> 07:17.187
You bet I am!

07:19.106 --> 07:22.234
Aunty?
It's me, Emily.

07:25.653 --> 07:27.322
I brought Miranda with me.

07:27.405 --> 07:29.157
Do you remember Miranda?

07:29.241 --> 07:30.408
Of course, she remembers me.

07:31.868 --> 07:33.620
Soup is good.

07:33.703 --> 07:35.288
See?

07:35.372 --> 07:38.416
Aunty Moira,
I'm gonna sing a song for you...

for free.

07:45.966 --> 07:48.926
Okay, now to the important stuff.
Listen.

07:49.011 --> 07:51.263
Aunty Moira, when you die,
and you need someone

07:51.346 --> 07:53.890
to take care of all your money
and all your stuff, I'm available.

07:53.974 --> 07:57.602
Miranda, that is so inappropriate.
Don't talk about death here.

07:57.685 --> 07:59.396
Oh, right. Right.

08:00.397 --> 08:02.315
So, when you go to sleep...

08:02.399 --> 08:04.401
-forever...
-[Jim] Emily. Emily.

08:04.484 --> 08:07.279

they need you at the front desk.

08:07.362 --> 08:08.780
At the front desk, why?

08:08.863 --> 08:10.823
[stammers] Uh, I think
they think it's a forgery.

08:10.907 --> 08:12.159
That you forged your signature.

08:12.242 --> 08:13.660
That doesn't make any sense.

08:13.743 --> 08:17.747
It's something with Aunty Moira
about, uh, her pills or head...

08:17.830 --> 08:20.750
Mouth pills.
Go... go check. Go check.

08:20.833 --> 08:22.002
I'll be right back.

08:24.712 --> 08:28.591
Miranda, in case you couldn't tell,
I was lying to your sister.

08:28.675 --> 08:30.760
Listen, something incredible
just happened.

08:30.843 --> 08:33.513
There's a huge Hollywood director
over there.

08:33.596 --> 08:36.849
Just wasting away
amongst these ordinary old people.

in your rise to fame.

Tit's a pleasure, Mr. Hamburg.

09:04.252 --> 09:06.879
I'm Miranda, and you need
to put me in your next movie.

09:06.963 --> 09:09.006
I have an extensive acting resume,

09:09.091 --> 09:11.926

in various venues,

09:12.009 --> 09:15.805
including my living room,
uh, my kitchen, closet--

09:15.888 --> 09:18.600
-Backyard.
-Oh, backyard.

09:18.683 --> 09:21.061
You sound like a talented young lady.

09:22.687 --> 09:24.731
Do I know talent?

You bet I do!

-[Jim softly] Wow. Yes!
-[softly] Yes!

09:30.737 --> 09:33.406
Right, well, I'm gonna perform
a monologue for you.

09:33.490 --> 09:35.283
It's really good.
It's from this amazing play that--

09:35.367 --> 09:36.951
[Emily] Nope, nope, nope.
No, you don't.

09:37.034 --> 09:38.620
Emily, you're interrupting my audition.

09:38.703 --> 09:40.330
Okay, this was all a big mistake,

09:40.413 --> 09:42.665
and I should've known you two
would do something like this. Let's go.

09:42.749 --> 09:44.876
-Come on, we're leaving.
-[Miranda whines] Emily.

09:44.959 --> 09:46.169
-Come on.
-[Miranda] He wanted to see me perform.

09:46.253 --> 09:47.837
[Emily] I don't care.

10:08.108 --> 10:09.692
Okay, uh...

10:10.610 --> 10:12.362
Should I put the guitar down?
Or is it--

10:12.445 --> 10:17.117
Ah, no. No, it's... it's...
it's more of an emotional confrontation.

10:17.200 --> 10:19.786
Okay, let me stop you right there, dude.

10:19.869 --> 10:23.039
I... [chuckles]
I get this all the time.

10:23.123 --> 10:25.542
You're not the first guy
to express his feelings for me.

10:25.625 --> 10:30.255
Uh, no. I don't have...
feelings for you, Owen, um...

10:33.550 --> 10:35.635
I'm in love with Miranda.

10:35.718 --> 10:37.094

10:38.513 --> 10:39.764
Miranda.

10:44.602 --> 10:45.645
Amanda?

10:45.728 --> 10:48.898
Oh, Amanda,
the chick with the lipstick, uh-huh.

10:49.857 --> 10:52.527
Right. So, I just...

10:52.610 --> 10:53.861
I want you to know...

10:54.779 --> 10:57.407
that if you break her heart,
I will hunt you down.

10:58.325 --> 10:59.701
And do what?

11:02.036 --> 11:03.205
What?

11:03.288 --> 11:04.914
Hunt me down and do what?

11:05.707 --> 11:07.417
I don't know.

11:07.500 --> 11:11.003
[stammering] I will hunt you down,

11:11.087 --> 11:15.258
and... and I will probably explain
how hurtful your actions were.

11:16.218 --> 11:18.303
Well, uh,
as threatening as that sounds,

11:18.386 --> 11:20.222
[chuckles]
you don't have to worry about it.

11:20.305 --> 11:22.432
I'm not interested in Amanda.

11:22.515 --> 11:23.600
[chuckles]

11:24.517 --> 11:26.353
[sighs] Oh, thank God.

11:26.436 --> 11:29.814
Okay, good talk. So, listen,
I'm gonna get back to my guitar now.

11:29.897 --> 11:33.526
Do you mind if I listen for a while?
I find you relaxing.

11:33.610 --> 11:36.821
[chuckles] I respect that.

11:38.781 --> 11:40.783
[guitar strumming]

11:44.996 --> 11:46.414
-The coast is clear.
-Okay.

11:46.498 --> 11:47.540
Okay.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.877
I don't know why we're sneaking.
Why can't we just sign in?

11:50.960 --> 11:55.382
Because Emily has to do it.
Besides, my plan is so much better.

11:55.465 --> 11:57.967
We're gonna light
this garbage can on fire...

11:58.050 --> 11:59.176
-Ooh...
-...and then we're gonna wait

11:59.261 --> 12:02.179
for widespread havoc
and general pandemonium to ensue.

12:02.264 --> 12:05.392
Then we're gonna go inside
and you're gonna audition for Hamburg.

12:05.475 --> 12:06.684
Oh, you're a genius!

12:06.768 --> 12:08.895
-Ah, thank you. I think I am, yes.
-Mmm-hmm.

12:09.812 --> 12:12.357
-Hold on, I forgot the matches.
-What?

12:12.440 --> 12:15.985
-Oh, now we'll never get in!
-[shushing]

12:16.068 --> 12:18.321
I have the plan.
I saw some matches inside.

12:18.405 --> 12:19.447
So, this is what we're gonna do.

12:19.531 --> 12:22.033
We're gonna sneak inside
past the receptionist,

12:22.116 --> 12:24.243
get the matches,
sneak back outside,

12:24.327 --> 12:27.372
and then light this garbage can on fire!

12:27.455 --> 12:29.416
Oh, I love show business.

12:29.499 --> 12:31.000
[softly] Me, too.

12:34.003 --> 12:37.048
I'm just an ordinary person here,
of no particular origin.

12:37.882 --> 12:39.467
[groans]

12:39.551 --> 12:40.802
As I was saying,

12:40.885 --> 12:43.220
I'm just an ordinary person here,
of no particular origin,

12:43.305 --> 12:47.266
just returning this, uh, random geriatric
to her urine-soaked bed.

12:47.350 --> 12:49.143
Weren't you here earlier today?

12:49.226 --> 12:50.812
[stammers] Uh, no, you must be...

12:50.895 --> 12:54.357
[chuckles nervously] clearly confusing me
with someone else and his niece.

12:54.441 --> 12:57.151
Oh, yeah.
Now I remember you. Just go.

12:57.234 --> 13:00.405
No. No, you don't remember me.
[chuckles] No, not at all.

13:17.547 --> 13:19.131
I got the matches.
Let's go.

13:19.215 --> 13:21.343
Oh, well, he's right here.
Can't I just perform for him now?

13:21.426 --> 13:23.636
Oh, good idea.
And we'll light the fire after.

13:23.720 --> 13:25.304
Okay. Good plan.

13:27.974 --> 13:30.352
Hello and welcome to my audition.

13:30.435 --> 13:31.811
What?

13:31.894 --> 13:36.273
Mr. Hamburg, I'm really looking forward
to being in one of your upcoming movies.

13:36.358 --> 13:40.111
Miranda can play any role imaginable.
Just watch this.

13:40.194 --> 13:42.154
Miranda, show him sad.

13:43.197 --> 13:44.449
Now, show him sadder.

13:45.950 --> 13:47.869
Now, show him bored.

13:49.454 --> 13:50.747
And elated.

13:52.665 --> 13:54.125
Are you seeing this?

13:54.208 --> 13:56.002
Okay. Okay.
You are not impressed,

13:56.085 --> 13:58.880
but face acting
is not everyone's cup of tea, so...

13:58.963 --> 14:00.172
I know.
Can I... can I sing now?

14:00.256 --> 14:02.884
Yes.
Now, Miranda will sing for you.

14:02.967 --> 14:07.054
Miranda has the voice
of an obese Viking princess.

14:07.138 --> 14:09.807
And, Miranda,
it's your time to sing.

14:10.892 --> 14:14.145

Ooh, bravo!

14:36.167 --> 14:38.503
Oh, Bravo!
Ooh, Bravo!

14:38.586 --> 14:40.797
Okay, you guys
cannot be doing this here.

14:40.880 --> 14:43.383
Okay, can you just leave?
I just did an incredible performance.

14:43.466 --> 14:46.260
I'm having a high,
and you're coming in and making it a low.

14:46.343 --> 14:47.929
-[Emily] Can you please just...
-What?

14:48.012 --> 14:50.056
Mr. Hamburg, I am so sorry.

14:50.139 --> 14:52.642
What're you sorry about?
That Miranda stopped singing?

14:53.560 --> 14:55.019
Mr. Hamburg...

14:58.355 --> 15:00.024
Mr. Hamburg...

15:03.945 --> 15:05.822
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

15:06.906 --> 15:07.949
He's dead.

15:09.283 --> 15:11.118
-What? He's not dead!
-[Jim] Dead?

15:11.202 --> 15:13.496
-You guys killed him. What did you do?
-[Miranda] What?

15:13.580 --> 15:15.915
[Jim] Nobody panic. This isn't
the first dead body I've been around.

15:15.998 --> 15:16.999
What?

15:17.083 --> 15:20.169
If anyone asks, we were at the Luxor hotel
in Las Vegas, Nevada.

15:20.252 --> 15:22.046
[Miranda crying]
Uncle Jim, this is terrible.

15:22.129 --> 15:25.299
-What about my career?
-[crying] No! Oh, God!

15:25.382 --> 15:27.594
A man has died here!

15:27.677 --> 15:29.011
I know!
We're very upset!

15:30.638 --> 15:32.181
Emily, get out of the way, okay?

15:32.264 --> 15:33.475
I need to mourn.

15:33.558 --> 15:35.560
We were so close
to getting me that movie deal.

15:36.519 --> 15:38.980
-We were so close!
-You're ridiculous!

15:39.063 --> 15:41.733
Stop! What you're crying about
is so meaningless.

15:41.816 --> 15:43.818
[gasps] It's okay, sweetheart.

15:43.901 --> 15:46.028
You go ahead and cry
if you feel like crying.

15:46.112 --> 15:47.614
Thank you.

15:47.697 --> 15:50.116
[crying] I'm so emotional.

15:50.199 --> 15:52.326
You know what? I need to go.
She's really upsetting me.

15:52.409 --> 15:54.704
And I'm not in a good state of mind
right now.

15:54.787 --> 15:56.330
[Jim] Let's get out of here.

15:56.413 --> 15:57.999
Let's light the fire.

16:04.506 --> 16:07.509
For some reason,
business has been real slow today.

16:09.385 --> 16:10.928
That's too bad.

16:11.929 --> 16:14.056
I picked a scab yesterday.

16:14.140 --> 16:15.808
Didn't even bleed.

16:15.892 --> 16:18.394
Mmm, I love when that happens.

16:18.478 --> 16:20.229
[cell phone vibrating]

16:22.231 --> 16:24.441
-What?
-[man] <i>Hi, is this Miranda?</i>

16:24.526 --> 16:26.736
-Yes.
<i>-Miranda, hi.</i>

16:26.819 --> 16:28.696
<i>This is Bob Hamburg's nephew, Ben.</i>

16:28.780 --> 16:31.032
<i>I heard you were with my uncle</i>
<i>when he died.</i>

16:31.115 --> 16:33.910
<i>I had no idea</i>
<i>you were that close to him.</i>

16:33.993 --> 16:35.369
So close. [sobs]

16:35.452 --> 16:37.872
When he died,
there was no one closer to him than me.

16:37.955 --> 16:41.083
<i>Well, listen, I was wondering</i>
<i>if you could do me a favor.</i>

16:41.167 --> 16:42.960
<i>I'm stuck in New York</i>
<i>for the next few weeks,</i>

16:43.044 --> 16:45.838
<i>so, unfortunately, I'm not</i>
<i>gonna be able to get to the funeral.</i>

16:45.922 --> 16:48.716
<i>And I was wondering</i>
<i>if you might say a few words</i>

16:48.800 --> 16:51.678
<i>about my uncle for me</i>
<i>at the service.</i>

16:51.761 --> 16:53.930
Mmm, yeah.
I'd love to perform.

16:54.013 --> 16:56.098
Bob was gonna help me
with my acting career.

16:56.182 --> 16:57.725
<i>Well, listen,</i>
<i>I'm in the industry,</i>

16:57.809 --> 16:59.811
<i>and, uh, if you're ever here in New York</i>
<i>and you want to talk,</i>

16:59.894 --> 17:01.103
<i>please give me a call.</i>

17:01.187 --> 17:02.772
Did you even hear a word I said?

17:02.855 --> 17:06.858
I said I'm an actor.
I don't want some industrial job.

17:09.779 --> 17:10.905
Okay.

17:11.906 --> 17:13.199
[cell phone beeps off]

17:28.130 --> 17:30.049
This funeral will have
a real depressing vibe.

17:30.132 --> 17:32.426
So we need to find a costume
that will cheer everyone up.

17:32.509 --> 17:35.137
Something colorful and spectacular.

17:35.221 --> 17:36.848
[Miranda] Oh. How about a red feather boa?

17:36.931 --> 17:38.015
Oh, let's see.

17:38.099 --> 17:40.434
Ooh, the daddy saddle!
Wanna take it for a ride?

17:40.517 --> 17:43.312
No, we don't have time.
This eulogy is important.

17:43.395 --> 17:47.942
Miranda, you're not doing the eulogy
for Mr. Hamburg, are you?

17:48.025 --> 17:51.195
Yes, she is.
Her big break.

17:51.278 --> 17:54.073
-Isn't this exciting, Emily?
-No, it's not exciting.

17:54.156 --> 17:57.118
Guys, a eulogy is a sensitive
and sacred thing.

17:57.201 --> 17:58.410
Yeah, I know it's sacred.

17:58.494 --> 18:01.455
That's why I'm using
my sacred singing voice to honor him...

18:01.538 --> 18:02.749
and to get more famouser.

18:02.832 --> 18:04.416
-There's gonna be lots of people there.
-[sighs]

18:04.500 --> 18:05.710
Yes.

18:05.793 --> 18:08.420
Hollywood movers and shakers, Emily.

18:08.504 --> 18:10.673
Mr. Hamburg is in heaven now,

18:10.757 --> 18:14.343
so why don't you
sing to him in the backyard,

18:14.426 --> 18:15.803
where he can hear you better?

18:15.887 --> 18:19.891
-How about that?
-Emily, my special child.

18:19.974 --> 18:24.937
It's hard to schmooze Hollywood
movers and shakers from the backyard.

18:25.021 --> 18:26.731
[Miranda chuckles]

18:26.814 --> 18:29.400
-And he's definitely not in heaven.
-Ah.

18:29.483 --> 18:30.526
[Emily] But--

18:32.569 --> 18:34.030
[Miranda] Ooh! A hat!
[Jim] Ooh! A hat!

18:37.659 --> 18:40.077
-[Bethany] What?
-[chuckles]

18:40.161 --> 18:42.121
-Hey.
-I hope you're not in too much pain today.

18:42.204 --> 18:45.416
Oh! A sling.
So thoughtful.

18:45.499 --> 18:49.420
-Yeah, go ahead. Try it on.
-[sighs] Okay. Let's see.

18:50.546 --> 18:52.548
Oh, wow. Perfect.

18:52.632 --> 18:54.801
-Thank you.
-So listen,

18:54.884 --> 18:58.095
there's a funeral
coming up tomorrow at the church,

18:58.179 --> 19:00.597
and I was kind of wondering
if you might wanna go with me.

19:00.682 --> 19:02.308
You know, like a date.

19:02.391 --> 19:04.310
Oh, Keith, I just couldn't.

19:04.393 --> 19:07.063
Well, you know,
Miranda is giving the eulogy tomorrow,

19:07.146 --> 19:10.900
and I just, I... I don't know,
if she ever knew I was on a date with you,

19:10.983 --> 19:14.278
it'd be like that whole thing I went
through when I was pregnant with Emily,

19:14.361 --> 19:16.238
and... No, thank you.

19:16.322 --> 19:18.866
You're gonna be at the funeral.
I'm gonna be at the funeral.

19:18.950 --> 19:20.284
We'll see each other there.

19:20.367 --> 19:23.287
And no one will have the slightest idea
that it's our first date.

19:24.163 --> 19:26.457
[clicks tongue] Oh...
Really?

19:26.540 --> 19:27.624
Yeah.

19:27.709 --> 19:30.086
-Okay. [chuckles] Okay.
-[Keith chuckles] All right.

19:30.169 --> 19:33.255
Just look for the girl
with the slinky black sling.

19:35.132 --> 19:36.300
[chuckles]

19:36.383 --> 19:37.885
I mean,
I'll have on other things.

19:37.969 --> 19:40.554
'Cause, otherwise,
it would be very inappropriate.

19:55.862 --> 19:57.529
-Excuse me, my lady.
-Oh. [chuckles]

19:57.613 --> 20:02.534
Would you mind terribly if I sat near you
without appearing... conspicuous?

20:02.618 --> 20:03.703
Well, good sir,

20:03.786 --> 20:06.914
in a very platonic-looking way,
I don't see why not.

20:06.998 --> 20:09.375
Hmm, wonderful, friend.

20:09.458 --> 20:11.252
-[chuckles]
-Right.

20:11.335 --> 20:13.462
Excuse me.
God bless you.

20:13.545 --> 20:15.923
Perfect spot right here.

20:16.007 --> 20:17.466
All right.

20:18.509 --> 20:19.719
[Bethany laughs softly]

20:22.096 --> 20:23.765
-Patrick.
-Hi.

20:23.848 --> 20:26.517
I need you to talk to Miranda, okay?
You have to stop her from doing this.

20:26.600 --> 20:28.685
Stop her?
She's gonna be great.

20:28.770 --> 20:30.772
Okay, but it's not about Miranda
being great, okay?

20:30.855 --> 20:34.233
It's about Mr. Hamburg.
We're supposed to be honoring his life.

20:34.316 --> 20:37.486
Are you kidding?
I couldn't think of a greater honor.

20:37.569 --> 20:41.783
If you told me Miranda was gonna sing
at my funeral, I would die tomorrow.

20:41.866 --> 20:44.285
-[groans]
-Look at her.

20:45.286 --> 20:46.996
She moves like a meerkat.

21:02.219 --> 21:04.138
Oh, this can't be good.

21:09.643 --> 21:10.853
I'm so sorry.

21:49.558 --> 21:52.269
Yeah. It was amazing.
[scoffs] Were you not watching?

21:52.353 --> 21:55.189
Oh, God. No, no, no.
You can't sing that.

21:55.272 --> 21:59.068
Okay, I picked a better song for you.
See, "Amazing Grace."

21:59.151 --> 22:02.446
And then I also wrote some words
for you to say about Mr. Hamburg.

22:02.529 --> 22:03.614
You know, respectful words.

22:03.697 --> 22:07.743
Words that everyone here will appreciate
and find comforting, and not offensive.

22:07.827 --> 22:11.163
Okay, well... I'm happy to
see you're finally supporting me, Emily.

22:11.247 --> 22:12.456
So, thank you for that.

22:12.539 --> 22:15.542
Um, and also, thank you for this.
I think it will be very helpful.

22:17.461 --> 22:19.088
Okay, good. Great.

22:19.171 --> 22:21.382
Well... good luck then.

22:23.800 --> 22:25.636
-[whispering] Sweetheart...
-[pastor] What I did not steal...

22:25.719 --> 22:28.264
...could you tell
that goddess next to you

22:28.347 --> 22:31.683
that I love what she did
with her black sling?

22:31.767 --> 22:33.978
[pastor] ...the wrongs I have done
are not hidden from you.

22:34.061 --> 22:36.355
[softly] He thinks you're a black goddess.

22:36.438 --> 22:39.358
[pastor] Let not those who hope in you
be put to shame...

22:39.441 --> 22:43.905
[whispering] Will you tell him
I said thank you and that I'm glad I came?

22:45.739 --> 22:48.242
She said she's glad and she came.

23:01.630 --> 23:03.340
[inhales deeply] Welcome.

23:03.424 --> 23:06.552
Thank you for coming.
God, I'm so emotional.

23:06.635 --> 23:08.387
[whispers] Oh, that's my niece.

23:08.470 --> 23:10.472
You know,
I prepared a speech for the occasion.

23:12.016 --> 23:13.100
But now that I'm up here,

23:13.184 --> 23:16.062
I feel like it'd be better
if I just spoke from my heart.

23:23.319 --> 23:24.486
Too soon!

23:24.570 --> 23:25.612
[sighs]

23:25.696 --> 23:28.074
Mr. Hamburg died too soon.

23:29.033 --> 23:30.826
There was so much more
he could have done,

23:30.909 --> 23:31.994
he would have done...

23:32.078 --> 23:33.370
for me.

23:34.413 --> 23:36.832
It's a day that will forever live
in inflammation.

23:36.915 --> 23:40.169
[whispering] Yeah, we debated that word,
but I think it's correct.

23:40.252 --> 23:42.879
I'll never forget
how upset I was when he died.

23:42.964 --> 23:45.341
Because that meant that
he couldn't help me become a movie star,

23:45.424 --> 23:47.093
and now he's completely
useless to me.

23:47.176 --> 23:49.178
-[crowd gasping]
-[indistinct murmuring]

23:51.013 --> 23:52.974
I know!
Lousy luck, right?

23:53.057 --> 23:54.183
[sighs]

23:54.266 --> 23:56.060
The freakin' worst.
[chuckles]

23:57.061 --> 24:01.940
So, anyways...
Bob is dead, but you guys are here.

24:02.024 --> 24:03.775
Even though it looks
like you won't be for much longer.

24:03.859 --> 24:07.279
No offense.
[chuckling] No offense.

24:07.363 --> 24:08.697
[chuckles]

24:11.367 --> 24:15.662
I have decided to perform for you guys,
because I'm gonna be the bigger person.

24:15.746 --> 24:20.667
I'm gonna sing a song that I prepared.
It will blow your minds.

24:20.751 --> 24:22.503
Because I'm an incredible performer,

24:22.586 --> 24:26.007
and probably all of you guys
will be able to help me out

24:26.090 --> 24:27.216
in becoming more famouser.

24:27.299 --> 24:29.551
Maybe you can tell a friend
or a family member

24:29.635 --> 24:32.013
about this amazing girl
you saw at the funeral.

24:32.096 --> 24:34.098
"Oh, what up, Mary?
Just saw this really good girl.

24:34.181 --> 24:36.933
She's so talented."
[chuckles] You know?

24:40.021 --> 24:41.688
So, anyways...

24:42.689 --> 24:44.400
I'm gonna sing a song
for you guys now.

24:44.483 --> 24:46.527
-You'll see how talented I am...
-[heart beating]

24:46.610 --> 24:48.570
[voice echoing]
...and I'm definitely gonna get a gig.

24:48.654 --> 24:51.573
So, welcome to the funeral,
everybody!

24:51.657 --> 24:54.576
-I'm so excited to be your host.

Miranda, we are not here
for a show, okay?

25:20.602 --> 25:23.605
We're here to look at this dead man,
say a few nice things about him,

25:23.689 --> 25:24.731

She is awesome. [chuckles]

You remembered her name.

Great.

It's the best funeral ever.

Emily came in and ruined everything.

No, no, no. It was great.
You really made an impression, all right?

26:09.360 --> 26:12.821

these people are gonna go home,

they're gonna look you up online,
and your numbers are going to skyrocket.

26:21.330 --> 26:23.290
-Yes!
-I hope you both learned your lesson.

26:23.374 --> 26:25.709
Uh, yeah. I learned a lesson
that you're a freakin' jealous hater

who needs to get a life.

26:27.002 --> 26:30.297
-Jealousy, Emily, is ugly.
-Really ugly.
