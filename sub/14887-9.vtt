01:43.321 --> 01:44.521
No, uh‐uh...

01:44.554 --> 01:45.788
M‐more than a new watch.

02:04.152 --> 02:06.519
Balki, Rolexes
are very expensive.

02:06.552 --> 02:09.619
Well, I guess I really stepped
in something good this time.

02:12.285 --> 02:14.218
‐ Yeah, let me look at it.
‐ No, no.

Come, on, let me
see your new watch.

From Leon.

03:22.810 --> 03:25.243
Leon? Who is Leon?

03:25.277 --> 03:27.677
Leon. The human discount
department store.

03:31.742 --> 03:34.442
All of the merchandise,
none of the parking problem.

03:36.076 --> 03:38.642
I meet him in the hall
after night school.

03:38.676 --> 03:40.341
And I bet he gave you
a good deal, right?

03:40.375 --> 03:42.141
Well, you can say that again.

03:42.175 --> 03:45.208
He let me have it for $38.95.

03:48.375 --> 03:50.040

Wait a minute.

03:56.207 --> 03:59.239
Are you saying,
that Leon is a crook?

03:59.273 --> 04:01.273
And that these watches
are counterfeit?

04:01.306 --> 04:03.073

04:05.173 --> 04:06.173
Yes.

04:07.205 --> 04:08.438

My point is,
first thing tomorrow morning

04:12.572 --> 04:16.471
we are going down to the police
and tell them about this Leon.

04:16.504 --> 04:18.404
You didn't buy anymore watches
from him, did you?

04:18.437 --> 04:22.237
Well, of course not.
Don't be ridiculous.

05:01.199 --> 05:02.332
Tell her, cousin.

05:07.199 --> 05:09.599
A scam artist sold Balki
two phony watches

05:09.632 --> 05:11.531
and a necklace
of no value whatsoever

05:11.565 --> 05:13.231
so we went to the police
and quite frankly

05:13.265 --> 05:15.131
they were no help at all.

05:15.165 --> 05:17.998
They said,
"Don't call us, we'll call us."

is incompetent

Can't your husband... help us?

Well, he could,
but he's in homicide.

05:45.795 --> 05:48.127
Well, when he gets back,
can't he give us a call?

No, uh, you see, honey

I'm thinking, we work
for the most powerful newspaper

supposed to guess that?

what we're doing.

His supplier. We'll set up
a meeting in a couple of days.

08:01.146 --> 08:02.746
That'll give us time
to get the newspaper involved.

08:02.779 --> 08:03.946

over The Supremes?

13:40.151 --> 13:42.151
Yes, I do.

13:42.184 --> 13:44.116
Now, Balki, we're supposed
to meet these guys

13:44.150 --> 13:45.216
in half an hour.

13:45.250 --> 13:46.216
The money's ready.

13:46.250 --> 13:47.783
Let's get going.

13:47.816 --> 13:50.650
Okay, cousin, um,
before we go...

13:50.683 --> 13:51.783
...I think I ought to point out

13:51.816 --> 13:54.615
one small but...
significant flaw

13:54.649 --> 13:56.682
in your otherwise
brilliant plan.

13:58.182 --> 13:59.849
Um...

13:59.882 --> 14:02.548
Somebody...
I'm not naming names.

14:04.281 --> 14:06.514

The President's face on this.

14:09.114 --> 14:11.047
Blank green paper.

14:11.780 --> 14:15.313
Balki, I have put a $20 bill

14:15.347 --> 14:17.780
on the top
of each stack of paper.

14:17.813 --> 14:20.712
So that it looks like,
there's $15,000

14:20.746 --> 14:22.279
in the briefcase.

14:23.379 --> 14:25.746
What if they want
to see the money?

14:25.779 --> 14:28.711
Of course, they'll want
to see the money.

14:30.511 --> 14:33.211
But I will only
let them look, not touch.

14:34.345 --> 14:37.444
I will open the briefcase,
like so...

14:37.477 --> 14:40.710
...then I'll quickly
close the briefcase, like so.

14:40.744 --> 14:42.144
They will have seen the money

14:42.177 --> 14:43.444
but they will not have
touched the money.

14:43.477 --> 14:46.809
Therefore, they will believe
that there is $15,000

14:46.843 --> 14:49.076
in fact in the briefcase.

14:49.109 --> 14:50.109
‐ Now can we go?
‐ Question.

14:53.643 --> 14:54.643
What?

14:54.676 --> 14:56.308
After you open the briefcase

14:56.342 --> 14:57.808
aren't they going
to grab the money?

14:59.475 --> 15:01.275
Oh, I see.

15:03.208 --> 15:05.507
You think
they can grab the money

15:05.541 --> 15:07.341
before I can close
the briefcase.

15:07.374 --> 15:08.474
That is correct.

15:11.574 --> 15:13.206
