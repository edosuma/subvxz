WEBVTT

00:02.269 --> 00:03.971
Both: CHEERS!

00:03.971 --> 00:05.005
(laughing)

00:05.005 --> 00:07.040
MMM.

00:07.040 --> 00:09.343
WOW. I DIDN'T KNOW
I LIKED TEA SO MUCH.

00:09.343 --> 00:10.477
DUDE, IT'S BEER.

00:10.477 --> 00:14.414
I THOUGHT DOING THE GIRLIEST
THING IN THE WORLD WOULD
HELP ME UNDERSTAND WOMEN,

00:14.414 --> 00:17.150
BUT ALL I'VE LEARNED
IS THAT LITTLE CHAIRS
MAKE MY BUTT FALL ASLEEP.

00:17.150 --> 00:18.218
SERIOUSLY, BEN.

00:18.218 --> 00:20.521
I MEAN, IF YOU'RE STILL
THAT MISERABLE
ABOUT RILEY,

00:20.521 --> 00:22.222
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
TALK TO HER?

00:22.222 --> 00:24.725
TELL HER HOW YOU FEEL.
MAN UP!

00:24.725 --> 00:26.159
SNACK CAKE?

00:26.159 --> 00:28.295
NO, I DID,

00:28.295 --> 00:30.063
BUT NOW WE'RE IN
THIS WEIRD LIMBO.

00:30.063 --> 00:32.699
I TOLD HER SHE NEEDS
TO FIGURE OUT IF SHE HAS
FEELINGS FOR MY BROTHER OR NOT.

00:32.699 --> 00:34.735
-AND DOES SHE?
-WHO KNOWS?

00:34.735 --> 00:37.404
IT'S NOT LIKE SHE BOTHERED
TO TELL ME HOW SHE FEELS.

00:37.404 --> 00:38.472
I JUST FEEL STUCK.

00:38.472 --> 00:41.675
LOOK, IT SOUNDS
LIKE YOU NEED TO TAKE
BACK CONTROL, OKAY?

00:41.675 --> 00:44.444
BECOME THE MASTER
OF YOUR OWN DESTINY.

00:44.444 --> 00:46.013
CRUMPET?

00:46.013 --> 00:49.049
YOU KNOW, MAN?
YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:49.049 --> 00:50.751
I'M DONE, OKAY?

00:50.751 --> 00:52.986
IT'S TIME TO MOVE ON.
RILEY AND I NEED TO BE
OFFICIALLY OVER.

00:54.454 --> 00:55.489
I'M STUCK.

00:55.489 --> 00:57.157
I KNOW.
WE GET IT.

00:57.157 --> 01:00.160
NO, TUCKER.
I'M REALLY STUCK.

01:00.160 --> 01:03.063
(theme music plays)

01:03.063 --> 01:06.099
♪ <i>IT'S AMAZING HOW</i>
<i>THE UNEXPECTED</i> ♪

01:06.099 --> 01:09.102
♪ <i>CAN TAKE YOUR LIFE</i>
<i>AND CHANGE DIRECTION</i> ♪

01:12.506 --> 01:16.043
ALL RIGHT, EMMA. WHICH ONE
IS PRETTY FOR GRANDMA?

01:16.043 --> 01:17.144
HMM?

01:17.144 --> 01:19.012
OH! AWW.

01:19.012 --> 01:20.347
KNOCK, KNOCK.

01:20.347 --> 01:22.349
OH, HI. MRS. WHEELER,
CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION?

01:22.349 --> 01:24.117
YOU JUST DID.
NOW MY TURN.

01:24.117 --> 01:26.587
WHICH ONE OF THESE SAYS,

01:26.587 --> 01:30.424
"PERMISSION TO BOARD
THE S.S. BONNIE"?

01:30.424 --> 01:32.359
I'LL ASSUME THAT MEANS "PRETTY."

01:32.359 --> 01:34.428
UM, I DON'T KNOW. WHAT ARE
YOU WEARING IT WITH?

01:34.428 --> 01:35.462
THIS.

01:35.462 --> 01:37.264
OH, WOW.

01:37.264 --> 01:39.299
I ACTUALLY MEANT THE SHOES.

01:39.299 --> 01:41.368
I ACTUALLY MEANT SEX.

01:43.670 --> 01:46.106
RILEY, IT IS FLEET WEEK.

01:46.106 --> 01:47.975
THE NAVY IS IN TOWN,

01:47.975 --> 01:50.978
INCLUDING ONE VERY SEXY
CAPTAIN HUDSON.

01:50.978 --> 01:53.513
WE ALWAYS MEET
AT THE SAME PIER,

01:53.513 --> 01:55.682
AND HAVE THE SAME
MAGICAL WEEKEND.

01:55.682 --> 01:57.684
THEN, LIKE ALL GOOD
MAGIC TRICKS,

01:57.684 --> 01:59.987
HE DISAPPEARS.

02:01.221 --> 02:03.624
-THAT'S SO ROMANTIC.
-YEAH.

02:03.624 --> 02:05.626
I REALLY WANT TO TALK
TO YOU AND ME AND BEN.

02:05.626 --> 02:08.295
-UGH!
-HE IS THE ONE WHO SAID
WE SHOULD TAKE A TIMEOUT

02:08.295 --> 02:11.365
BECAUSE HE HAD SOME CRAZY IDEA
THAT I HAVE FEELINGS FOR DANNY.

02:11.365 --> 02:13.266
ME HAVING FEELINGS FOR DANNY?

02:13.266 --> 02:14.601
THAT IS JUST CRAZY, RIGHT?

02:14.601 --> 02:16.603
THAT'S SO CRAZY.
DON'T YOU THINK THAT'S CRAZY?

02:18.071 --> 02:19.172
WELL, I WOULD HAVE AGREED

02:19.172 --> 02:20.607
IF YOU DIDN'T SAY STUFF LIKE,

02:20.607 --> 02:21.742
"IT'S CRAZY, RIGHT?

02:21.742 --> 02:24.411
"SO CRAZY! I MEAN,
DON'T YOU THINK IT'S CRAZY?"

02:24.411 --> 02:26.747
-(baby laughs)
-(mouths)

02:28.749 --> 02:32.185
WELL, I AM TELLING YOU
THE SAME THING I TOLD BEN.

02:32.185 --> 02:34.721
I DO NOT HAVE FEELINGS
FOR DANNY!

02:36.023 --> 02:37.090
DANNY, HEY!

02:39.292 --> 02:40.494
HEY, RILES.

02:42.562 --> 02:44.197
SEE? NOTHING.

02:44.197 --> 02:45.232
AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE?

02:45.232 --> 02:49.236
THE NEXT TIME I SEE BEN,
I AM TELLING HIM THAT I WANT
TO GET BACK TOGETHER.

02:49.236 --> 02:50.270
-HI.
-HI.

02:50.270 --> 02:53.073
ALL RIGHT.
JUST DON'T MAKE HIM CRY.

02:53.073 --> 02:55.342
OTHERWISE, I'LL DO
THIS AGAIN!

02:55.342 --> 02:57.310
OH MAN.

02:57.310 --> 03:00.080
LOOK AT IT, RILEY!
THIS IS YOUR FUTURE!

03:03.450 --> 03:04.484
THIS ONE'S ON THE HOUSE,

03:04.484 --> 03:06.219
ESPECIALLY IF YOU COME BACK
TO MY HOUSE.

03:09.756 --> 03:11.124
OKAY.

03:11.124 --> 03:12.726
YEAH, A LITTLE RUSTY.

03:12.726 --> 03:15.228
BUT IT COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE.
I MEAN, AT LEAST SHE DIDN'T
LAUGH AT YOU.

03:16.296 --> 03:18.231
OH, WAIT, NO.
NOW SHE'S LAUGHING AT YOU.

03:19.499 --> 03:21.635
HEY, BY THE WAY,
WHATEVER HAPPENED WITH RILEY?

03:21.635 --> 03:22.669
HOW'D SHE TAKE IT?

03:22.669 --> 03:25.572
WELL, SHE HASN'T CALLED ME BACK,
SO I'M GUESSING SHE'LL
TAKE IT FINE.

03:25.572 --> 03:27.708
OOH, I'M GOING BACK IN.

03:27.708 --> 03:30.110
SO, YOU LOOKING FOR A STUD?

03:30.110 --> 03:33.513
I ALREADY GOT THE "S.T.D."
ALL I NEED IS "U."

03:33.513 --> 03:35.115
LET ME START AGAIN.

03:37.217 --> 03:39.486
SADLY, THAT WAS
ACTUALLY BETTER.

03:39.486 --> 03:43.056
YEAH, BUT LUCKY FOR YOU,
THERE'S A TON OF CUTE GIRLS
IN HERE TO PRACTICE ON.

03:45.025 --> 03:47.527
OH, CRAP.
I FORGOT IT'S FLEET WEEK.

03:47.527 --> 03:49.196
DAMN IT!

03:49.196 --> 03:51.364
WE'VE BEEN DOCK-BLOCKED.

03:53.667 --> 03:55.302
OKAY, PEOPLE!

03:55.302 --> 03:57.604
THE S.S. BONNIE
JUST HIT AN ICEBERG.

03:59.039 --> 04:00.607
HEY, MA,
HOW'D IT GO WITH YOUR SAILOR?

04:00.607 --> 04:04.010
TERRIBLE. HORRIBLE. THE WORST.

04:04.010 --> 04:06.113
HE WANTS TO MARRY ME!

04:08.048 --> 04:11.618
OKAY, I NORMALLY DON'T GET
THIS CONFUSED SO EARLY
IN THE CONVERSATION.

04:12.686 --> 04:17.991
DANNY, THE REASON YOU DATE
A SAILOR IS BECAUSE
THEY SAIL AWAY.

04:17.991 --> 04:19.760
BEN! IS BEN HERE?

04:19.760 --> 04:21.595
NO, I THINK HE'S
WORKING A DOUBLE.

04:21.595 --> 04:23.363
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
HASHBROWN HIM?

04:23.363 --> 04:26.566
YOU KNOW? THAT'S WHAT
ALL YOU KIDS ARE DOING.

04:31.138 --> 04:32.405
WE KEEP MISSING EACH OTHER,

04:32.405 --> 04:34.141
AND I REALLY WANT TO TALK
TO HIM IN PERSON.

04:34.141 --> 04:37.711
PLUS... I SEEM
TO HAVE LOST MY PHONE.

04:37.711 --> 04:40.680
OH MY GOD. I JUST
SHARED A CAB WITH A FRIEND.
I MUST HAVE LEFT IT THERE.

04:40.680 --> 04:42.015
LOOKING FOR THIS?

04:42.015 --> 04:43.583
ROBYN! OH, THANK YOU!

04:43.583 --> 04:44.985
HOW DID YOU KNOW
WHERE I WAS?

04:44.985 --> 04:48.054
WELL, YOU DOODLE
"BEN WHEELER" ON YOUR PAD
DURING EVERY STAFF MEETING.

04:48.054 --> 04:50.590
FOR A WHILE,
I THOUGHT THAT BEN WHEELER
WAS A LEGAL TERM.

04:51.625 --> 04:54.127
GUYS, THIS IS ROBYN.

04:54.127 --> 04:55.629
MY OFFICE BESTIE.

04:55.629 --> 04:57.364
HI, I'M DANNY.

04:57.364 --> 04:59.166
THE BROTHER SHE APPARENTLY
DOESN'T DOODLE.

04:59.166 --> 05:01.001
BUT SHE SHOULD.

05:01.001 --> 05:02.202
I'D DOODLE YOU.

05:04.437 --> 05:06.540
OKAY, WELL...

05:06.540 --> 05:08.508
I'VE GOTTA GO MEET DRINK
FOR A BEN.

05:08.508 --> 05:10.343
NO, BEN FOR A DRINK!

05:10.343 --> 05:12.045
IT WAS MEETY
LOVING YOU.

05:12.045 --> 05:13.180
LOVELY MEETING ME.

05:13.180 --> 05:15.348
YOU! I-- I GOTTA GO. BYE.

05:18.084 --> 05:20.120
OH MY GOD,
IS HE SINGLE?

05:20.120 --> 05:21.988
AND IF HE IS,
CAN I MAKE HIM UN-SINGLE?

05:23.056 --> 05:25.725
WELL, UH, WHO? DANNY? SINGLE?

05:25.725 --> 05:27.727
I MEAN, NOT REALLY.
SORT OF.

05:27.727 --> 05:31.565
KIND OF, I GUESS.
I DON'T THINK HE'S READY
TO MEET ANYONE NEW,

05:31.565 --> 05:33.567
SO... NO.

05:34.968 --> 05:37.337
WELL, MAYBE THE RIGHT GIRL
WOULD MAKE HIM READY.

05:37.337 --> 05:39.172
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH ONE COFFEE DATE?

05:39.172 --> 05:41.107
YEAH, RILEY.

05:41.107 --> 05:42.509
WHO DOESN'T LOVE COFFEE?

05:45.145 --> 05:49.683
UNLESS, YOU HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH SOMEBODY GOING OUT
WITH DANNY.

05:49.683 --> 05:53.019
WAIT, NO!

05:53.019 --> 05:55.322
(mockingly)
THAT'S CRAZY! SO CRAZY!
DON'T YOU THINK IT'S CRAZY?

06:04.264 --> 06:08.001
I DON'T KNOW, TUCK.
I FEEL LIKE WE SHOULD BE ON
A BOX OF FROZEN FISH STICKS.

06:08.001 --> 06:10.303
DON'T WORRY, MAN.
I GOT THIS.

06:10.303 --> 06:13.073
"IN THE NAVY" IS MY
GO-TO KARAOKE SONG.

06:13.073 --> 06:14.274
OH, THERE.

06:15.575 --> 06:18.011
HEY, YOU GUYS BETTER
HEAD BACK TO THE SHIP.

06:18.011 --> 06:19.279
CAPTAIN'S LOOKING FOR YOU.

06:19.279 --> 06:20.413
HE KNOWS WHAT
YOU DID LAST NIGHT.

06:21.581 --> 06:23.516
THEY ALL DID SOMETHING
LAST NIGHT.

06:25.085 --> 06:27.454
HI, I'M SEAMAN TUCKER,
AND THIS IS PRIVATE BENJAMIN.

06:27.454 --> 06:29.089
(giggles)
YOU SAID SEMEN.

06:31.558 --> 06:32.993
WE'RE IN THE NAVY.

06:32.993 --> 06:34.694
THERE'S A SONG ABOUT IT.

06:34.694 --> 06:36.463
MY JOB IS TO FIRE
THE TORPEDOES.

06:36.463 --> 06:38.131
YEAH, IT'S PRETTY
BADASS.

06:38.131 --> 06:39.165
(mimics cannon firing)

06:39.165 --> 06:41.401
-WHOA!
-RILEY, HEY!

06:41.401 --> 06:42.969
BEN, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

06:42.969 --> 06:45.071
MANAGEMENT THOUGHT IT WOULD
BE A FUN PROMOTION
FOR FLEET WEEK.

06:45.071 --> 06:47.107
CHIPS, AHOY, MATIES!

06:47.107 --> 06:49.309
I'M SO SORRY
THAT I HAVEN'T
CALLED YOU BACK YET.

06:49.309 --> 06:51.678
BUT, I REALLY WANT
TO TALK TO YOU, TOO. ABOUT US.

06:51.678 --> 06:53.680
-YOU DO?
-YES! SO MUCH.

06:53.680 --> 06:55.715
BUT, UH, HEY,
CAN WE DO IT LATER?
AFTER YOUR SHIFT?

06:55.715 --> 06:57.317
OKAY, YEAH, SURE.
LATER'S BETTER.

06:57.317 --> 06:59.019
LATER'S GOOD.
I LIKE LATER.
HERE'S TO LATER!

07:01.321 --> 07:02.989
WHAT WAS THAT?
I THOUGHT YOU
WERE MOVING ON?

07:02.989 --> 07:05.125
YEAH, NO,
I THOUGHT I WAS TOO,

07:05.125 --> 07:06.660
BUT MAYBE I JUMPED SHIP
TOO SOON.

07:06.660 --> 07:07.694
SHE SAID SHE WANTS
TO TALK.

07:07.694 --> 07:10.297
AND I CAN BE TALKED OUT
OF MY TALK AND TALKED
INTO HER TALK

07:10.297 --> 07:12.198
IF HER TALK IS ABOUT
US GETTING BACK TOGETHER!

07:12.198 --> 07:14.467
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

07:14.467 --> 07:18.271
DUDE, IF SHE WANTED
TO GET BACK TOGETHER,
SHE WOULD HAVE SAID IT.

07:18.271 --> 07:21.107
FACE IT, BEN.
THAT SHIP HAS SAILED.

07:21.107 --> 07:23.476
I DON'T MEAN
TO EAVESDROP, SAILOR,

07:23.476 --> 07:25.078
BUT I THINK
YOUR FRIEND IS RIGHT.

07:25.078 --> 07:27.981
WHEN A WOMAN SAYS
SHE WANTS TO TALK,

07:27.981 --> 07:30.116
IT ALWAYS MEANS
SHE WANTS TO WALK.

07:31.484 --> 07:33.153
I'M NOT READY
TO BE SET UP, RIGHT NOW.

07:33.153 --> 07:35.188
OKAY.

07:35.188 --> 07:37.023
WILL YOU BE READY, TOMORROW?

07:37.023 --> 07:39.192
PLEASE? IT WOULD MEAN
SO MUCH TO ME.

07:39.192 --> 07:41.161
FINE. SET AWAY.

07:44.164 --> 07:45.999
YEAH, I GUESS IF SHE WANTED
TO GET BACK TOGETHER,

07:45.999 --> 07:47.233
SHE'D BE HUGGING ME,
INSTEAD OF MY BROTHER.

07:47.233 --> 07:49.536
I HATE BEING RIGHT
ABOUT THESE THINGS,

07:49.536 --> 07:53.473
EXCEPT WHEN A CUTE SAILOR
LIKE YOURSELF IS NOW SINGLE.

07:53.473 --> 07:54.607
CAN I BUY YOU A DRINK?

07:57.577 --> 07:58.745
YEAH, THAT'D BE GREAT.

08:00.146 --> 08:03.049
SO, YOU LOOKING
FOR A STUD?

08:03.049 --> 08:04.584
I'VE ALREADY GOT "U,"
I JUST NEED AN "S"--

08:04.584 --> 08:06.252
NO, DAMN IT,
THAT DOESN'T WORK EITHER.

08:09.689 --> 08:10.724
Riley:
<i>MRS. WHEELER?</i>

08:10.724 --> 08:14.027
OH, RILEY.
THANK GOD THAT YOU'RE HERE.

08:14.027 --> 08:15.428
I CAN'T GO HOME!

08:15.428 --> 08:19.666
CAPTAIN CLINGY HAS BEEN
STAKING OUT MY LOBBY
ALL DAY!

08:19.666 --> 08:23.737
WELL, I HAVE SUCCESSFULLY
SET UP DANNY AND ROBYN,

08:23.737 --> 08:26.706
THUS PROVING I HAVE
NO FEELINGS FOR DANNY,

08:26.706 --> 08:30.110
THUS IN YOUR FACE,
MRS. WHEELER!

08:30.110 --> 08:34.114
YOU'RE RIGHT, RILEY.
YOU OBVIOUSLY HAVE NO FEELINGS
FOR DANNY, WHATSOEVER,

08:34.114 --> 08:37.384
AND ARE COMPLETELY FOCUSED
ON YOUR RELATIONSHIP
WITH BEN.

08:37.384 --> 08:40.720
HEY, RILES.
THANKS SO MUCH FOR CONVINCING ME
TO GO OUT WITH ROBYN.

08:40.720 --> 08:43.089
WE SPENT, LIKE, TWO HOURS
ON THE PHONE LAST NIGHT.

08:43.089 --> 08:45.225
AND THAT WAS BEFORE
I FELL ASLEEP AND HAD
TO CALL HER BACK.

08:47.027 --> 08:48.228
I LIKE THIS GIRL.

08:48.228 --> 08:50.530
I'M ACTUALLY MEETING HER
AT THE BAR, RIGHT NOW,
SO DON'T WAIT UP.

08:56.236 --> 08:58.004
-SO, THIS IS ME...
-MM-HMM.

08:58.004 --> 09:02.042
WATCHING MY FRIEND DANNY
GO OUT THE DOOR TO BE WITH
ANOTHER WOMAN.

09:02.042 --> 09:05.378
PLEASE NOTE MY COMPLETE
LACK OF REACTION.

09:07.013 --> 09:09.282
YOU HAVE REALLY NICE PORES.

09:09.282 --> 09:12.452
(phone buzzes)

09:12.452 --> 09:13.520
OH.

09:13.520 --> 09:16.423
HEY, BESTIE!
I HEAR YOU'RE OFF
TO MEET MY BOY?

09:16.423 --> 09:18.591
<i>Oh my god, yes!</i>
<i>Thank you!</i>

09:18.591 --> 09:20.293
<i>I just broke up with my ex</i>
<i>two weeks ago,</i>

09:20.293 --> 09:23.029
<i>and I've been in desperate need</i>
<i>of a rebound to help me</i>
<i>get over him.</i>

09:23.029 --> 09:26.032
I'M SORRY.
I THINK WE HAVE
A BAD CONNECTION.

09:26.032 --> 09:27.434
IT SOUNDED LIKE
YOU JUST SAID "REBOUND"?

09:27.434 --> 09:29.469
<i>Yeah. I'll tell you</i>
<i>all about it at work tomorrow.</i>

09:29.469 --> 09:32.172
<i>unless I take</i>
<i>a very personal day.</i>

09:32.172 --> 09:33.206
<i>Bye!</i>

09:33.206 --> 09:35.108
OH MY GOD.

09:35.108 --> 09:37.043
NO, NO, NO, NO!

09:37.043 --> 09:37.977
I HAVE TO WARN DANNY!

09:37.977 --> 09:41.147
I MEAN, IF HE
FINDS OUT HE'S A REBOUND,
IT'LL BREAK HIS HEART.

09:41.147 --> 09:43.983
AND, YOU KNOW,
SOMEHOW, HE'S GONNA
FIND A WAY TO BLAME ME.

09:45.752 --> 09:48.555
OH! BREAK HIS HEART!

09:48.555 --> 09:50.457
OH, WHY DIDN'T
I THINK OF THAT?

09:50.457 --> 09:52.058
OH, UH-HUH.

09:53.159 --> 09:54.394
OH, HEY, CAPTAIN.

09:54.394 --> 09:55.995
LISTEN, WE NEED
TO TALK.

09:55.995 --> 09:59.032
YEAH, I KNOW
YOU'RE IN THE LOBBY.
I'LL BE RIGHT DOWN.

10:02.969 --> 10:04.404
HEY, THAT'S CHARLOTTE.

10:04.404 --> 10:07.373
SHE'S BEEN BEGGING ME
TO GIVE HER A TOUR
OF THE SHIP.

10:07.373 --> 10:09.676
HEY, BY THE WAY,
WHAT HAVE YOU
BEEN CALLING IT?

10:09.676 --> 10:12.212
THE ONLY SHIPS I KNOW
ARE TITANIC AND LOLLIPOP.

10:13.580 --> 10:14.647
OH, RILEY'S HERE.

10:14.647 --> 10:16.483
HAVE YOU GUYS MADE
YOUR BREAKUP OFFICIAL?

10:16.483 --> 10:18.751
NO, AND I OWE IT TO HER
TO TELL HER I'VE MOVED ON.

10:18.751 --> 10:20.120
SHE OBVIOUSLY HAS, TOO.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.422
RILEY, HEY.
SO, ABOUT US--

10:22.422 --> 10:24.557
OH, YES,
WHICH I SO WANT
TO TALK ABOUT.

10:24.557 --> 10:26.025
RIGHT NOW,
I HAVE TO FIND
YOUR BROTHER.

10:26.025 --> 10:27.260
I THINK HE'S
IN THE BATHROOM.

10:27.260 --> 10:29.329
WAIT, RILEY.
THIS IS STUPID.

10:29.329 --> 10:32.232
I KNOW WHAT YOU WANT
TO TALK ABOUT, AND I'VE
THOUGHT ABOUT IT,

10:32.232 --> 10:33.466
AND I AGREE WITH YOU.

10:33.466 --> 10:36.202
REALLY? YOU DO?

10:36.202 --> 10:38.605
TOOK ME A WHILE
TO GET THERE, BUT YEAH,

10:38.605 --> 10:40.240
I THINK THAT WE BOTH KNOW
THIS IS RIGHT.

10:40.240 --> 10:42.041
OH MY GOD.

10:42.041 --> 10:44.277
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW NERVOUS I WAS.

10:44.277 --> 10:45.979
I MEAN, I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

10:45.979 --> 10:48.214
I DIDN'T KNOW IF
IT WAS GOING TO BE AWKWARD,

10:48.214 --> 10:49.616
BUT WHY SHOULD IT BE, RIGHT?

10:49.616 --> 10:50.984
EXACTLY.

10:52.085 --> 10:54.587
I LOVE THAT WE CAN JUST
GO RIGHT BACK TO BEING US.

10:54.587 --> 10:56.089
YOU'RE AMAZING.

10:56.089 --> 10:58.224
OH, WELL, UH,
I'LL SEE YOU
AFTER YOUR SHIFT?

10:58.224 --> 11:00.059
-YEAH.
-OKAY.

11:00.059 --> 11:01.127
I HAVE TO GO
TALK TO YOUR BROTHER.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.200
HOW'D IT GO?

11:07.200 --> 11:08.201
IT'S OVER.

11:08.201 --> 11:10.203
RILEY AND I
ARE OFFICIALLY BROKEN UP.

11:10.203 --> 11:14.307
OH MY GOD,
BEN AND I ARE OFFICIALLY
BACK TOGETHER!

11:14.307 --> 11:16.075
BUT ENOUGH ABOUT ME.

11:16.075 --> 11:17.577
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT--

11:17.577 --> 11:20.046
ROBYN! HI!

11:20.046 --> 11:22.615
WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT
HOW AWESOME YOU ARE.

11:22.615 --> 11:24.217
THANKS.

11:24.217 --> 11:26.085
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

11:26.085 --> 11:29.088
OH, WELL, YOU KNOW,
JUST THOUGHT I'D GRAB
A QUICK BITE WITH YOU GUYS.

11:29.088 --> 11:32.192
MAYBE HELP SMOOTH OVER
SOME AWKWARD SILENCES.

11:32.192 --> 11:35.094
FIRST DATES CAN BE
PRETTY TRYING, SO...

11:37.030 --> 11:38.665
AND THEN SHE GIVES ME
A GOODBYE KISS.

11:38.665 --> 11:40.600
ARE WE DOING THAT NOW?
IS THAT A THING?

11:40.600 --> 11:41.734
WHEN DID THAT START?

11:41.734 --> 11:45.071
DUDE, MOVING ON, REMEMBER?

11:45.071 --> 11:48.641
THE BEST WAY
TO GET OVER ONE GIRL
IS TO GET UNDER ANOTHER.

11:48.641 --> 11:50.109
I SUGGEST THE ONE
FROM YESTERDAY.

11:50.109 --> 11:52.445
SHE'S RIGHT THERE.

11:52.445 --> 11:55.248
SHE'LL HELP YOU MOVE ON,
AND ME MOVE ON TO THAT SHIP.

11:55.248 --> 11:56.749
HOW CAN SHE DO THAT?

11:56.749 --> 11:59.052
SEE THOSE LITTLE STRIPY
THINGIES ON HER SHOULDER?

11:59.052 --> 12:00.453
SHE'S AN OFFICER.

12:00.453 --> 12:03.690
IF WE'RE WITH HER,
NO ONE'S GONNA ASK
ANY QUESTIONS.

12:03.690 --> 12:05.525
THEN I THINK
I NEED TO GET ON BOARD.

12:05.525 --> 12:07.126
ALL RIGHT, TUCKER.

12:07.126 --> 12:09.762
PULL UP YOUR ANCHOR,
WE'RE GOING IN.

12:09.762 --> 12:12.465
NO, SERIOUSLY, MAN.
YOUR ZIPPER'S DOWN.

12:12.465 --> 12:13.600
I GOT IT.

12:15.034 --> 12:18.338
BONNIE, I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU WON'T MARRY ME?

12:18.338 --> 12:19.505
WE'RE SO GOOD TOGETHER.

12:19.505 --> 12:21.674
LOOK, RANDY,
IT'S NOT YOU,

12:21.674 --> 12:22.709
IT'S ME.

12:22.709 --> 12:24.444
WELL, THEN I'M WILLING
TO WORK ON YOU.

12:24.444 --> 12:26.980
OKAY, LET'S TRY THIS AGAIN.

12:26.980 --> 12:28.448
HERE.

12:28.448 --> 12:31.551
LOOK, YOU WERE JUST
A REBOUND TO ME.

12:31.551 --> 12:35.088
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
I GOT DUMPED
BY ANOTHER NAVY MAN,

12:35.088 --> 12:39.325
AND YOU ARE JUST
A PAINFUL REMINDER.

12:39.325 --> 12:43.529
A SEXY,
SLIGHTLY STALKERY REMINDER.

12:44.998 --> 12:46.366
-OKAY THEN.
-YEAH.

12:46.366 --> 12:48.701
WELL, I GUESS THERE'S
REALLY NOTHING I CAN DO.

12:52.005 --> 12:53.039
BUH-BYE.

12:55.275 --> 12:57.477
WHAT THE--

12:57.477 --> 12:58.511
WHAT ARE YOU--

12:58.511 --> 13:01.147
-HEY, SEE THAT
OFFICER OVER THERE?
-YEAH.

13:01.147 --> 13:03.082
WANTED ME
TO GIVE YOU HIS NUMBER.

13:03.082 --> 13:06.352
OH! OH MY GOSH,
THANK YOU SO MUCH!

13:08.688 --> 13:10.256
THAT'S WHAT I LOVE
ABOUT FLEET WEEK.

13:10.256 --> 13:13.259
YOU CAN JUMP ONE SHIP,
AND LAND RIGHT ON ANOTHER.

13:15.128 --> 13:16.162
THAT WAS HIM,
WASN'T IT?

13:16.162 --> 13:17.196
WHO WAS WHAT?

13:17.196 --> 13:18.698
THE GUY.
THE GUY YOU'RE
IN LOVE WITH?

13:18.698 --> 13:20.266
-SURE, WHY NOT.
-I'M GONNA KILL HIM.

13:20.266 --> 13:22.068
UH, WHAT?

13:25.038 --> 13:26.739
Riley:
<i>AND THAT'S WHEN I REALIZED,</i>

13:26.739 --> 13:29.075
"HEY, I'M IN TORONTO!"

13:30.276 --> 13:32.278
OH, AND YOU WILL NOT GUESS
WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THAT.

13:32.278 --> 13:34.247
THE STORY ENDED
AND YOU WENT HOME?

13:34.247 --> 13:36.449
OOH, HOME!
WHAT A GOOD IDEA.

13:36.449 --> 13:39.118
HOW ABOUT YOU AND I
GO BACK TO YOUR PLACE
AS SOON AS I FINISH THIS?

13:43.990 --> 13:45.558
OH LOOK,
YOU'RE DONE!

13:45.558 --> 13:46.626
NO, NO, NO,
NO, NO.

13:46.626 --> 13:48.995
YOU TWO ARE NOT
GOING ANYWHERE.

13:48.995 --> 13:50.129
THIS NEXT ROUND'S ON ME.

13:51.631 --> 13:54.100
HELLO, ANOTHER ROUND, PLEASE.

13:55.335 --> 13:56.569
THANK YOU.

14:01.040 --> 14:02.508
QUESTION.

14:02.508 --> 14:06.212
WHAT IS YOUR RETURN POLICY
ON BEER?

14:13.152 --> 14:15.088
I'M SURPRISED
I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU BEFORE.

14:15.088 --> 14:17.056
I REALIZE THERE ARE
THOUSANDS OF MEN ON BOARD,

14:17.056 --> 14:19.325
BUT I FEEL LIKE
I WOULD HAVE
NOTICED YOU, RIGHT?

14:19.325 --> 14:22.362
I USUALLY STAY
IN THE BACK.

14:24.263 --> 14:28.134
WELL, MAYBE IT'S TIME
TO PROMOTE YOU TO THE FRONT?

14:28.134 --> 14:30.269
Tucker:
BEN! BEN, WHERE ARE YOU?

14:30.269 --> 14:32.305
TUCKER?

14:32.305 --> 14:34.006
-TUCKER, WHAT ARE YOU--
-OH GOD, BEN!

14:34.006 --> 14:35.708
BEN, YOU GOTTA
HIDE ME, MAN.

14:35.708 --> 14:37.210
THERE'S A CRAZY MAN
CHASING ME.

14:39.212 --> 14:40.313
TUCKER?

14:40.313 --> 14:41.981
OOH, I'LL BE BACK
FOR YOU, LATER.

14:44.016 --> 14:46.185
TUCKER? OH, TUCKER!
THERE YOU ARE.

14:46.185 --> 14:48.454
OKAY, I JUST WANNA GIVE YOU
A LITTLE HEADS UP.

14:48.454 --> 14:50.690
MY EX-BOYFRIEND
WANTS TO KILL YOU,

14:50.690 --> 14:53.659
AND HE KNOWS HOW TO DO IT
18 DIFFERENT WAYS.

14:53.659 --> 14:57.730
OH, GREAT,
SO I CAN PICK
HOW I WANT TO DIE. COOL.

14:57.730 --> 14:59.165
(banging at the door)

14:59.165 --> 15:01.000
Captain:
OPEN THIS DOOR IMMEDIATELY!

15:01.000 --> 15:03.636
AMBER, I HOPE
WE'RE NOT MOVING TOO FAST,
BUT I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET MY MOM.

15:05.037 --> 15:07.707
AND, IT WOULD BE SUPER HELPFUL
IF YOU COULD HIDE HER
AND MY BEST FRIEND.

15:07.707 --> 15:09.108
(banging continues)

15:09.108 --> 15:11.244
OKAY, JUST HIDE IN THE BUNKS.
I'LL GET RID OF HIM.

15:11.244 --> 15:12.979
(banging intensifies)

15:14.647 --> 15:16.048
WHAT IS THE MEANING
OF THIS, SAIL--

15:16.048 --> 15:17.383
OH MY GOD!
CAPTAIN, SIR.

15:17.383 --> 15:20.386
I AM SO SORRY, SIR.
I DIDN'T REALIZE
IT WAS YOU, SIR.

15:20.386 --> 15:22.121
I'M LOOKING FOR
A GUTLESS TRAITOR.

15:23.089 --> 15:24.490
I HAVEN'T SEEN
ANYONE, SIR.

15:24.490 --> 15:26.125
HOW ABOUT I JUST
CHECK THE RACK MYSELF.

15:26.125 --> 15:28.594
SORRY, SIR.
I WAS JUST CHECKING THE BEDS.

15:28.594 --> 15:31.097
EXCELLENT CORNERS, OFFICER.

15:31.097 --> 15:32.765
THERE'S NO ONE ELSE
IN HERE, SIR.

15:32.765 --> 15:36.002
PERHAPS, WHOEVER YOU'RE
LOOKING FOR IS IN THE BACK.

15:48.047 --> 15:50.316
OH...

15:51.984 --> 15:54.153
HEY, HONEY BUNNY.

15:54.153 --> 15:56.022
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

15:57.056 --> 15:58.758
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT THIS, SAILOR?

15:58.758 --> 16:00.460
PROBABLY LESS
THAN YOU DO, SIR.

16:00.460 --> 16:01.727
LOOK, LET ME EXPLAIN.

16:01.727 --> 16:03.129
ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW WHAT,
I CAN EXPLAIN.

16:03.129 --> 16:05.498
ACTUALLY, THERE'S REALLY
NOTHING TO EXPLAIN.

16:05.498 --> 16:09.001
BECAUSE I'M ACTUALLY
NOT EVEN IN THE NAVY.

16:09.001 --> 16:11.737
LOOK, "CARRIE'S COSTUME CASTLE."

16:11.737 --> 16:14.207
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

16:14.207 --> 16:17.677
SEE, YOU HAVE NO POWER
OVER ME BECAUSE I'M
A CIVILIAN.

16:17.677 --> 16:19.645
ALSO KNOWN
AS A TAXPAYER,

16:19.645 --> 16:23.082
WHICH, TECHNICALLY,
MAKES ME IN CHARGE OF YOU.

16:26.586 --> 16:28.988
YEAH. IT DOESN'T
WORK LIKE THAT.

16:28.988 --> 16:30.523
OH, YEAH?
WELL, YOU KNOW SOME--

16:34.494 --> 16:37.029
SO, WHAT TIME
DOES THE BUFFET START
ON THIS THING?

16:37.029 --> 16:39.365
AND, DO I NEED A WRIST BAND?
I MEAN, HOW DOES IT WORK?

16:39.365 --> 16:41.067
I'LL FIGURE IT OUT.
I'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

16:43.336 --> 16:46.639
OKAY, I AM SO, SO,
SO SORRY ABOUT THAT.

16:46.639 --> 16:48.541
IT HAPPENS
EVERY FLEET WEEK.

16:48.541 --> 16:50.109
YOU KINDA JUST
GOTTA ROLL WITH IT.

16:50.109 --> 16:54.113
WELL, I'M READY TO ROLL.

16:54.113 --> 16:55.181
HOW 'BOUT YOU?

17:02.054 --> 17:05.091
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M SO SORRY,
I DON'T THINK I CAN DO THIS.

17:06.592 --> 17:08.227
GIRL AT THE BAR?

17:08.227 --> 17:11.097
I SHOULDN'T HAVE
JUST LET HER WALK AWAY.

17:11.097 --> 17:12.398
I HAVE TO GO FIGHT FOR HER.

17:12.398 --> 17:15.735
MAY I SAY,
SHE'S A REALLY LUCKY GIRL.

17:15.735 --> 17:18.471
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR UNDERSTANDING.

17:18.471 --> 17:21.607
I JUST HOPE
IT'S NOT TOO LATE.

17:21.607 --> 17:24.410
OH, AND JUST SO YOU KNOW,
I'M NOT REALLY A SAILOR, EITHER.

17:24.410 --> 17:25.511
OH, I KNOW.

17:25.511 --> 17:27.580
WE DON'T CALL IT
"THE BACK."

17:30.983 --> 17:32.618
(door rattling)

17:32.618 --> 17:34.020
HEY, GUYS!

17:34.020 --> 17:35.988
IT'S RILEY.

17:35.988 --> 17:39.025
UH, I WAS JUST
STOPPING BY TO SEE
HOW THE DATE'S GOING?

17:39.025 --> 17:40.660
DANNY, DO YOU MAYBE
WANNA STEP OUT HERE,

17:40.660 --> 17:42.461
AND HAVE A QUICK,
PRIVATE CHAT ABOUT IT?

17:44.630 --> 17:45.698
EXCUSE ME FOR A MINUTE.

17:51.370 --> 17:52.405
HI.

17:54.073 --> 17:55.541
WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON?

17:55.541 --> 17:58.110
WHAT'S SO IMPORTANT
THAT YOU HAVE TO INTERRUPT
MY DATE?

17:58.110 --> 17:59.145
TWICE?

17:59.145 --> 18:01.047
OH, OKAY, CALM DOWN.

18:01.047 --> 18:04.317
I JUST CAME HERE
TO WARN YOU THAT ROBYN IS
JUST USING YOU AS A REBOUND

18:04.317 --> 18:05.384
TO GET OVER HER EX.

18:05.384 --> 18:07.320
I KNOW.
I'M FINE WITH IT.

18:07.320 --> 18:08.487
WE TALKED ABOUT IT
LAST NIGHT.

18:08.487 --> 18:10.389
SERIOUSLY,
WHAT'S GOING ON?

18:10.389 --> 18:12.425
HOW COME EVERY TIME
I HAVE A GIRL IN MY LIFE,

18:12.425 --> 18:13.993
YOU GET OVER-PROTECTIVE
AND WEIRD?

18:13.993 --> 18:16.128
-NO, I DON'T.
-YES, YOU DO!

18:16.128 --> 18:17.563
YOU KIND OF ACT
LIKE A JEALOUS GIRLFRIEND.

18:17.563 --> 18:20.132
OH, WELL, I'M SORRY.
THAT'S WHAT FRIENDS DO.

18:20.132 --> 18:21.334
THEY PROTECT EACH OTHER.

18:21.334 --> 18:23.035
NO, FRIENDS ARE SUPPORTIVE!

18:23.035 --> 18:24.270
BUT YOU, WITH...

18:24.270 --> 18:27.106
WITH MILENA, AMY,
AND GEORGIE--

18:27.106 --> 18:28.708
IT'S LIKE NO ONE'S
EVER GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME.

18:28.708 --> 18:30.676
I JUST CARE ABOUT YOU.

18:30.676 --> 18:34.146
AND IF YOU CARED ABOUT ME,
YOU'D STOP DOING WHATEVER
THE HELL THIS IS.

18:34.146 --> 18:35.414
DANNY, I JUST--

18:35.414 --> 18:36.749
WHAT? YOU GOT
FEELINGS FOR ME NOW?

18:38.250 --> 18:42.021
NO. EXACTLY.
SO, LET ME GET BACK TO MY DATE.

18:43.556 --> 18:45.458
-DANNY...
-WHAT?

18:53.165 --> 18:54.967
I DO HAVE FEELINGS FOR YOU.

18:57.737 --> 18:58.971
OH MY GOD.

19:09.115 --> 19:11.484
-HI.
-OH, RILEY, HI.

19:11.484 --> 19:13.019
-YOU GOT MY MESSAGE.
-YEAH.

19:13.019 --> 19:14.987
CAN WE TALK?

19:14.987 --> 19:16.322
I MEAN,
REALLY TALK.

19:16.322 --> 19:18.524
I WOULD LOVE
TO TALK.

19:18.524 --> 19:21.027
OH, I DON'T EVEN
KNOW WHERE TO START.

19:21.027 --> 19:23.663
THEN LET ME
GO FIRST, OKAY?

19:23.663 --> 19:26.298
I'VE BEEN HAVING
SECOND THOUGHTS ABOUT
OUR CONVERSATION, ALL DAY.

19:26.298 --> 19:28.334
REALLY?

19:28.334 --> 19:30.269
OH MY GOD,
I'VE BEEN TOO.

19:30.269 --> 19:32.138
I THINK WE MADE
A BIG MISTAKE.

19:33.372 --> 19:35.107
I'M SORRY.
CAN YOU FORGIVE ME?

19:35.107 --> 19:37.543
FORGIVE YOU?

19:37.543 --> 19:39.979
OF COURSE.

19:39.979 --> 19:42.748
SO THEN, WE AGREE IT'S...

19:42.748 --> 19:44.383
IT'S BEST
IF WE BREAK UP FOR GOOD.

19:44.383 --> 19:46.152
YEAH, I--

19:48.287 --> 19:50.022
WAIT, WHAT?

19:51.424 --> 19:53.492
WELL, YOU WERE RIGHT.

19:53.492 --> 19:54.994
THIS...

19:56.495 --> 19:58.064
THIS WAS A MISTAKE.

19:59.298 --> 20:01.667
I THINK I LOVED YOU
FOR SO LONG

20:01.667 --> 20:05.171
I ACTUALLY WILLED YOU
INTO LOVING ME BACK.

20:05.171 --> 20:09.075
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I JUST TOOK YOU ALONG
FOR MY RIDE.

20:09.075 --> 20:11.444
AND THE TRUTH IS,

20:11.444 --> 20:13.713
WE'LL ALWAYS
BE BETTER AS FRIENDS.

20:16.649 --> 20:18.017
YOU AGREE, RIGHT?

20:19.518 --> 20:21.587
YEAH.

20:21.587 --> 20:23.122
FRIENDS. TOTALLY.

20:24.990 --> 20:26.726
WELL...

20:26.726 --> 20:29.762
I'M KIND OF PROUD OF US
THAT WE CAN BE SO MATURE
ABOUT THIS.

20:29.762 --> 20:32.231
(sighs)

20:32.231 --> 20:35.534
I GUESS, MAYBE THAT'S
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN
YOU REALLY LOVE SOMEONE.

20:37.603 --> 20:39.138
I LOVE YOU, BEN.

20:42.208 --> 20:43.509
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

20:48.547 --> 20:52.051
SO, I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE
WHAT JUST HAPPENED AROUND HERE,

20:52.051 --> 20:55.454
BUT I THINK THAT YOUR DAD
FINALLY BROKE UP WITH RILEY,

20:55.454 --> 20:59.759
RILEY MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE
FEELINGS FOR YOUR UNCLE DANNY

20:59.759 --> 21:01.494
AND, FOR WHATEVER REASON,

21:01.494 --> 21:04.230
I THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD IDEA
TO TURN DOWN A PROPOSAL

21:04.230 --> 21:07.767
FROM A GORGEOUS GUY
WITH A SIX-FIGURE PENSION.

21:07.767 --> 21:10.736
THAT'S WHY GRANDMA'S GOT
WINE IN HER TEACUP.

21:12.171 --> 21:14.273
(panting)

21:14.273 --> 21:16.142
YEAH. SEE THIS?

21:16.142 --> 21:18.978
TURNS OUT THERE IS SOMETHING
THAT THEY CAN DO TO CIVILIANS.
