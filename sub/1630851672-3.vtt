really are kind of a function
of the fact

50:58.290 --> 50:59.987
that she's had
some time to accept

51:00.031 --> 51:02.947
that this may be the only way
they're gonna be able to live.

51:02.990 --> 51:04.775
Well,
good morning.

51:04.818 --> 51:05.863
Victor.

51:05.906 --> 51:07.604
Dorie Sr. is waking up into this

51:07.647 --> 51:09.214
and is kind of
discovering the fact

51:09.258 --> 51:11.390
that they are now
forced to live with the man

51:11.434 --> 51:13.392
who he saw do
some pretty terrible things.

51:13.436 --> 51:15.655
I'm done listening to you,
Morgan.

51:15.699 --> 51:17.048
I'm going to do
what you couldn't.

51:17.092 --> 51:19.442
I'm going to rebuild
the world.

51:19.485 --> 51:22.053
I'm going to help everyone
that you let down.

51:22.097 --> 51:25.796
Strand is reallyenjoying the
fact that he is the leader now

51:25.839 --> 51:27.885
and Morgan's on the outs.

51:27.928 --> 51:30.366
I think in many ways it really
speaks to

51:30.409 --> 51:34.674
Strand's need
to kind of be recognized,

51:34.718 --> 51:37.851
and that's a big part
of what his journey's gonna be

51:37.895 --> 51:39.766
as we continue to go forward
in the season.

51:39.810 --> 51:42.465
I will come for you,
Victor.

51:42.508 --> 51:44.162
Bring it.

51:44.206 --> 51:46.904
It really is kind of setting up
this antagonism

51:46.947 --> 51:48.427
between these two characters

51:48.471 --> 51:50.908
as we continue to go
deeper into the season,

51:50.951 --> 51:52.388
and I think
it creates a question of,

51:52.431 --> 51:54.477
"Whose side
is everyone gonna fall onto

51:54.520 --> 51:56.435
as the conflict continues?"
