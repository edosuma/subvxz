Orbit has decayed over the northern sector.

Heads up, bots. Get ready to move.

Impact in five seconds.

01:02.076 --> 01:05.143

Coordinates six-one-seven by eight-eight-five.

01:14.811 --> 01:17.846
One hundred twenty kilometers north. Shall we go?

01:17.945 --> 01:19.846
No. Not yet.

01:19.946 --> 01:21.946
The Maximals will surely attempt to dispatch

01:22.046 --> 01:24.680
their only flyer to reach the pod first.

01:24.780 --> 01:29.848
Yes, let us ensure that he encounters turbulence.

01:31.814 --> 01:33.281
Gotta tell you, big bot.

01:33.382 --> 01:36.515
Doesn't sound like such a swift move, splitting up.

01:36.615 --> 01:37.882
We've got no choice.

01:37.982 --> 01:40.649
We're talking 100 klicks over rough territory.

01:40.749 --> 01:43.149
Megatron's sure to launch his own flyers.

01:43.249 --> 01:45.350
I have to get there first.

01:45.450 --> 01:49.751
I am not normally an advocate of caution, Optimus Primal.

01:49.851 --> 01:53.852
But in this case, I must register my concern.

01:53.951 --> 01:58.852
Megatron does not always behave as one might expect.

01:58.952 --> 02:02.286
He'll want to reach the pod first. Same as us.

02:02.386 --> 02:05.086
Right now it's a race, pure and simple.

02:05.186 --> 02:08.054
Optimus Primal, maximize!

02:10.954 --> 02:14.488
Nonetheless, you will do me the honor

02:14.588 --> 02:16.555
of permitting me to exit first.

02:16.655 --> 02:19.422
I have suspicions.

02:19.522 --> 02:22.323
All right. But hurry.

02:22.423 --> 02:26.224
Dinobot, maximize!

03:08.630 --> 03:11.864
My scanners detect no hostiles.

03:11.964 --> 03:15.765
Yet something feels amiss.

03:15.865 --> 03:18.699
Permit to lead a scouting patrol.

03:18.799 --> 03:20.932
Ugh, there isn't time.

03:21.032 --> 03:23.366
One of my comrades is out there somewhere,

03:23.466 --> 03:25.233
and every second counts.

03:25.333 --> 03:26.900
Your emotion chips

03:27.000 --> 03:29.033
are overriding your caution circuits.

03:29.134 --> 03:33.068
I insist upon a scouting patrol.

03:33.168 --> 03:35.001
I am in command here.

03:35.101 --> 03:36.702
Now stand aside!

03:36.802 --> 03:39.102
( dramatic theme playing )

03:46.103 --> 03:47.804
Primal jets, on!

03:50.404 --> 03:53.071
Have a ground unit follow me as quickly as possible.

03:53.171 --> 03:54.772
We have to-- Unh!

03:54.872 --> 03:57.038
Ambush! DINOBOT: As I suspected.

03:58.805 --> 04:01.172
( laughs )

04:01.272 --> 04:04.140
Waspinator got him.

04:04.240 --> 04:05.340

04:33.477 --> 04:38.112
Oh, no! Waspinator in trouble!

04:38.211 --> 04:41.446
We did our job. Now let's go. Back to base.

04:43.179 --> 04:46.046

04:46.147 --> 04:47.813
Cowards!

04:47.913 --> 04:50.480

Maximize!

04:55.148 --> 04:57.515

04:57.615 --> 04:59.616
Optimus! Oh, man.

04:59.716 --> 05:01.883
Can you hear me, big bot?

05:01.983 --> 05:03.449
DINOBOT: Fear not, Optimus.

05:03.549 --> 05:08.051
I shall ensure that your funeral is a glorious one,

05:08.150 --> 05:12.151
as befits a warrior who died in battle.

05:12.251 --> 05:13.484
( groaning )

05:13.584 --> 05:16.551
Afraid I'll have to miss it, Dinobot.

05:16.651 --> 05:18.652
I'm not scrap yet.

05:18.752 --> 05:21.719
Hm. Are you certain?

05:21.819 --> 05:24.887
It would be a triumphant passage.

05:24.986 --> 05:27.287
Ah, will you knock it off?

05:27.386 --> 05:29.787
We gotta get you in the CR chamber, big bot.

05:29.887 --> 05:32.587
Unh. No. The stasis pod.

05:32.687 --> 05:35.055
We'll get it. But right now, let's worry about you.

05:35.155 --> 05:37.355
Give me a hand here!

05:37.455 --> 05:40.189
Ah. All right.

05:48.891 --> 05:51.624
MEGATRON: So Optimus Primal was not destroyed.

05:51.724 --> 05:54.892
You disappoint me, Terrorsaur, yes.

05:54.991 --> 05:57.558
But we knocked him half to scrap.

05:57.658 --> 06:00.125
No way he'll be flying anywhere.

06:00.225 --> 06:05.593
Yes! We will beat them to the stasis pod easily.

06:05.693 --> 06:09.593
Hm, yes. But they will still make an attempt.

06:09.693 --> 06:12.194
Ah. A land party.

06:12.294 --> 06:14.995
Yes. Leaving only Optimus

06:15.095 --> 06:17.761
and perhaps one other to guard the base.

06:17.861 --> 06:21.362
Waspinator, Terrorsaur, you will proceed immediately

06:21.462 --> 06:23.129
to the location of the stasis pod.

06:23.229 --> 06:25.930
Ensure that the protoform robot inside

06:26.030 --> 06:30.063
is reprogrammed as a Predacon. Go!

06:33.031 --> 06:36.298
As for the rest of you, you shall not be idle.

06:36.398 --> 06:40.899
No. For with the Maximal base almost unguarded,

06:40.999 --> 06:43.633
this is the perfect time to strike.

06:43.733 --> 06:46.699
Yes. Follow me.

06:46.800 --> 06:49.434
( suspenseful theme playing )

06:52.734 --> 06:54.934
Man, I just don't think it's a slick plan,

06:55.034 --> 06:56.968
leaving Optimus back at base.

06:57.069 --> 07:01.502
Yeah. Especially with old chopper face as babysitter.

07:01.602 --> 07:03.269
Had to do it.

07:03.369 --> 07:06.270
Dinobot's weapons were damaged in the battle.

07:06.370 --> 07:09.603
He's gotta recuperate. And we gotta run.

07:09.703 --> 07:11.904
If that pod was cracked in the crash,

07:12.004 --> 07:14.571
the protoform robot inside will be exposed

07:14.671 --> 07:16.771
to the planet's energon fields.

07:51.577 --> 07:53.378
Well, look at that.

07:53.478 --> 07:57.511
We have competitors for the stasis pod, Waspinator.

07:57.611 --> 07:59.279
Oh!

07:59.379 --> 08:03.546
Waspinator not think so.

08:03.646 --> 08:06.747
Let's terrorize!

08:06.846 --> 08:09.947
( screeching )

08:10.047 --> 08:12.247
( dramatic rock theme playing )

08:12.347 --> 08:14.781
Incoming!

08:17.549 --> 08:18.549

08:18.649 --> 08:21.515
Shred those lousy fliers!

No. No, no, the bridge!

09:07.590 --> 09:11.824
That was some cold slag.

09:15.257 --> 09:17.325

09:20.725 --> 09:23.326
Ah. Maximal base,

09:23.426 --> 09:25.293
( over radio ): This is Rattrap.

09:26.960 --> 09:29.360
Hello, you read me, chopper face?

09:29.461 --> 09:31.227
We got problems.

09:33.427 --> 09:36.628
Speak, vermin.

09:36.727 --> 09:38.095
The Preds scrapped the bridge.

09:38.195 --> 09:39.762
No way across.

09:39.862 --> 09:42.596
We're gonna have to take the scenic route. Ah.

09:42.696 --> 09:45.729
Not a snowball's chance of beating them now.

09:45.830 --> 09:48.330
No excuses, you pathetic rodent!

09:48.430 --> 09:51.564
Keep moving! Dinobot out.

09:51.664 --> 09:55.031
Hey! You can just kiss my pink hairless--

09:58.565 --> 10:00.399
Hm...

10:00.499 --> 10:03.132
( suspenseful theme playing )

10:06.600 --> 10:09.700
Computer, access and activate

10:09.800 --> 10:12.501
Optimus Primal's core consciousness.

10:12.601 --> 10:14.734
COMPUTER: Acknowledged.

10:28.037 --> 10:30.103
Core consciousness activated.

10:30.204 --> 10:31.937
Onscreen.

10:39.672 --> 10:42.539
Don't tell me. Let me guess.

10:42.639 --> 10:44.773
Problems already?

10:44.873 --> 10:48.607
Indeed. The others have been forcibly delayed.

10:48.706 --> 10:51.440
The Predacons will reach the pod first.

10:51.540 --> 10:53.341
Have you any thoughts?

10:53.441 --> 10:57.008
Is there any way we can contact the pod?

10:57.107 --> 11:00.375
Hm. The energon fields are too strong.

11:00.476 --> 11:02.943
Our comm links will not reach.

11:03.043 --> 11:05.876
How about laser pulse?

11:05.976 --> 11:07.210
Impossible.

11:07.310 --> 11:10.977
We would need line-of-sight transmission.

11:11.077 --> 11:13.944
Isn't there anything we could bounce it off of?

11:14.044 --> 11:17.078
A mountain? Clouds?

11:17.178 --> 11:18.678
Anything?

11:18.778 --> 11:20.879
Hm...

11:20.979 --> 11:22.312
( gasps )

11:22.412 --> 11:24.946
Perhaps there is.

11:25.046 --> 11:27.613
( suspenseful theme playing )

11:32.347 --> 11:36.114
Ah, as I surmised. Yes.

11:36.215 --> 11:39.181
The remaining Maximal on guard is none other

11:39.281 --> 11:42.282
than our own traitorous turncoat.

11:42.382 --> 11:44.716
We shall not waste this opportunity.

11:44.816 --> 11:46.516
No.

11:53.351 --> 11:56.084
MEGATRON: Ah, Dinobot.

11:56.184 --> 11:57.685
Yes.

11:57.785 --> 11:58.952
( growls )

11:59.052 --> 12:02.285
Dinobot, maximize!

12:02.385 --> 12:04.419

12:06.186 --> 12:08.720
Oh, no, no, no. Calmness.

12:08.820 --> 12:10.653
Calmness, please.

12:10.753 --> 12:13.887
I came only to talk. Yes.

12:13.987 --> 12:16.221
After all, you are alone

12:16.321 --> 12:18.688
and in command of the Maximal base.

12:18.788 --> 12:21.856
An excellent opportunity, is it not?

12:21.956 --> 12:25.256
You were a Predacon once. Become one again.

12:25.356 --> 12:29.090
Turn the base over to me, and the Beast Wars will be over.

12:29.190 --> 12:32.157
We Predacons will rule the galaxy.

12:32.257 --> 12:34.858
And you shall be my second in command.

12:34.958 --> 12:37.191
What do you say?

12:37.291 --> 12:38.758
( laughs )

12:41.059 --> 12:44.226
Eat slag!

12:44.326 --> 12:45.960

12:47.493 --> 12:48.960
Vaporize him!

12:56.394 --> 12:57.928

12:59.128 --> 13:00.395
Finish him!

13:54.637 --> 13:56.137
( grunts )

13:56.238 --> 13:58.538
Fall back! Fall back!

14:01.506 --> 14:03.739
Now, Optimus.

14:03.839 --> 14:07.306
Laser in position.

14:09.139 --> 14:12.874
Forget the Maximal base! Let us secure the pod.

14:14.307 --> 14:18.208
Computer, uploading instructions now!

14:42.379 --> 14:44.579
( suspenseful theme playing )

14:46.079 --> 14:49.313
Whoa! What the shortin' circuit is going on?

14:49.413 --> 14:51.814
Whatever it is, it's too little, too late.

14:51.914 --> 14:55.181
The Preds are gonna beat us to the pod!

14:57.114 --> 14:59.381
( both roaring )

15:08.983 --> 15:13.084
Ooh! Waspinator sees the pod.

15:13.184 --> 15:14.718
( Waspinator giggles )

15:14.818 --> 15:16.584
WASPINATOR: Only a few minutes away.

15:16.684 --> 15:21.485
Megatron will reward Waspinator!

15:21.585 --> 15:24.286
Not if I get it first!

15:26.086 --> 15:29.053
( dramatic theme playing )

15:29.153 --> 15:32.387
Would that I could trust those fliers to secure the pod alone.

15:32.487 --> 15:34.087
( growls )

15:36.487 --> 15:38.054
OPTIMUS: Hang on, Dinobot.

15:38.154 --> 15:40.522
We'll have you restored before you know it.

15:40.622 --> 15:42.955
But in the meantime, I've gotta fly.

15:48.523 --> 15:50.990
Optimus Primal, maximize!

15:52.724 --> 15:55.224
Computer, deactivate auto cannons

15:55.324 --> 15:57.725
and reactivate in 30 seconds.

15:57.825 --> 15:59.125
COMPUTER: Acknowledged.

15:59.224 --> 16:01.092
OPTIMUS: Prime jets, on!

16:09.260 --> 16:11.260
Hurry!

16:13.094 --> 16:14.227
( Maximals thud )

16:14.327 --> 16:16.728
CHEETOR: Hold it right there.

16:16.828 --> 16:20.061
Yeah. You're messing with Maximal property,

16:20.161 --> 16:21.862
you thieving Preds.

16:21.962 --> 16:23.562
We've got a friend in there,

16:23.662 --> 16:26.530
and we won't let you turn him into a Predacon.

16:26.630 --> 16:29.897
You won't stop us, Maximals!

16:29.997 --> 16:32.163
( footsteps rumbling )

16:34.364 --> 16:36.931
They certainly shall not.

16:37.031 --> 16:39.665
Megatron, terrorize!

16:39.765 --> 16:42.199
( roars )

16:42.299 --> 16:44.599
The stasis pod is ours, Maximals.

16:44.699 --> 16:48.566

RHINOX: Let them go.

17:04.102 --> 17:05.702
They're not part of this.

17:05.802 --> 17:06.869
MEGATRON: That's right.

17:06.969 --> 17:08.836
Just innocent creatures.

17:08.936 --> 17:11.803
So surrender yourselves and this pod,

17:11.904 --> 17:13.603
or they shall be terminated.

17:13.703 --> 17:15.404
( both growling )

17:15.504 --> 17:18.038

17:25.439 --> 17:29.439
You win, you depraved wad of stinking slag.

17:29.540 --> 17:32.240
Cultivated as always, even in defeat.

17:32.340 --> 17:35.474
Now, witness my moment of triumph,

17:35.574 --> 17:38.874
as I reprogram the protoform Maximal within the pod

17:38.974 --> 17:42.608
into a Predacon. Yes.

17:44.775 --> 17:47.110
Open the pod!

17:58.511 --> 18:00.778
( suspenseful theme playing )

18:00.878 --> 18:02.012
( screams )

18:02.112 --> 18:03.679
What?

18:03.779 --> 18:07.013
It's empty.

18:07.113 --> 18:09.613
Where is the Maximal?

18:09.713 --> 18:11.713
MAXIMAL: Right here.

18:13.147 --> 18:16.814
Tigatron, maximize!

18:16.915 --> 18:19.648
( roars )

18:24.582 --> 18:26.349
Woo-hoo! All right!

18:26.449 --> 18:27.850
Let's do it!

18:27.949 --> 18:30.184
( dramatic rock theme playing )

18:39.818 --> 18:42.019
Beast mode, retreat!

18:42.119 --> 18:44.052
Retreat!

18:44.152 --> 18:46.252
( dramatic rock theme playing )

18:49.819 --> 18:51.253
( Megatron grunts )

18:51.353 --> 18:53.954
MEGATRON: Blast it all!

19:02.855 --> 19:05.189
Greetings. Tigatron?

19:05.289 --> 19:07.722
I'm Optimus Primal, Maximal commander.

19:07.822 --> 19:10.089
You had us worried for a while.

19:10.189 --> 19:11.623
We didn't know if you'd made it.

19:11.723 --> 19:13.523
Almost didn't.

19:13.623 --> 19:17.157
The crash damaged my identity circuits.

19:17.257 --> 19:19.824
I didn't know who I really was,

19:19.925 --> 19:23.158
or which side I was on, until--

19:23.258 --> 19:28.493
Until I saw you willing to risk your lives to save us.

19:28.593 --> 19:31.394
Well, we're just glad you came through.

19:31.493 --> 19:33.960
We could use another member of the Maximal force.

19:34.060 --> 19:36.227
Our ship, or what's left of it,

19:36.327 --> 19:38.328
is due south about 100 klicks.

19:38.428 --> 19:40.228
No. No.

19:40.328 --> 19:42.562
I'm sorry, but no.

19:42.662 --> 19:46.396
I am still more tiger than Maximal.

19:46.496 --> 19:49.563
Until my identity circuits restore themselves,

19:49.663 --> 19:53.697
I feel my place is here, in the wilds with--

19:53.797 --> 19:56.064
With my kind.

19:56.164 --> 19:58.831
But you may count on my loyalty.

19:58.932 --> 20:00.464
Sounds good to me.

20:00.565 --> 20:03.365
Yeah, uh, we could use a scout up here.

20:03.465 --> 20:06.033
You know, in case the Preds get up to something.

20:06.133 --> 20:08.933
Then it's settled. For now.

20:09.033 --> 20:12.433
But I have a feeling we'll meet again, Tigatron.

20:12.533 --> 20:14.667
And soon.

20:14.767 --> 20:17.634
( majestic theme playing )

20:25.869 --> 20:28.036
Let the trails lead where they may.

20:28.136 --> 20:30.970
I will follow.
