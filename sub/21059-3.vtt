<i>Previously on AMC's
"Turn: Washington's Spies"...</i>

00:03.024 --> 00:06.625
In portraying you, I, in fact,
outshined the original.

00:06.627 --> 00:09.161
She's been seen on the arm
of several bachelor officers.

00:09.163 --> 00:10.863
She may be seducing them for secrets.

00:12.166 --> 00:14.834
- What happened to Caleb?
- He was grabbed.

00:14.836 --> 00:17.737
I have evidence that he is
a key rebel spy.

00:17.739 --> 00:20.206
Talmadge the leader, you the career...

00:20.208 --> 00:21.607
Woodhull is cover.

00:21.609 --> 00:23.242
Their pirates took one of ours.

00:23.244 --> 00:24.944
You have ours take one of theirs.

00:24.946 --> 00:27.813
We're gonna go back and kidnap
Judge Woodhull and his son

00:27.815 --> 00:29.821
and trade them for Brewster.

00:35.690 --> 00:38.224
Come on.

01:23.231 --> 01:26.966
Havens, take Pitt.
You two reconnoiter the area.

01:27.001 --> 01:28.801
They should be coming from the Sound.

01:28.836 --> 01:32.205
Come on. Come on. To the mill.

01:36.811 --> 01:38.511
You could be here for a while.

01:38.546 --> 01:40.680
I'll try not to make these too tight.

01:43.318 --> 01:44.951
Look, I didn't know that the Regulars

01:44.986 --> 01:47.220
would come by when they did,
but they left me with no choice.

01:47.255 --> 01:49.855
Don't worry about us. When's the trade?

01:49.891 --> 01:53.125
They agreed upon today,
and to a ransom of £500 on top.

01:53.161 --> 01:54.560
Is that all?

01:54.596 --> 01:56.329
And we get Caleb back.
That's what really matters.

01:56.364 --> 01:57.897
<i>We'll be fine.</i>

01:57.932 --> 02:01.334
You... do what you need to do.

02:17.452 --> 02:18.884
He's right, you know.

02:20.822 --> 02:23.689
- No one could've seen Wakefield coming.
- I know.

02:23.725 --> 02:26.292
- It was either him or us.
- I know!

02:26.327 --> 02:28.594
Shh.

02:29.564 --> 02:30.997
Tallmadge did the right thing.

02:31.032 --> 02:32.152
I didn't.

02:33.234 --> 02:35.472
I tried to stop him
shooting the captain.

02:35.837 --> 02:37.336
Well...

02:39.607 --> 02:41.603
Wakefield was your friend.

02:42.312 --> 02:43.542
If I'd have saved him,

02:43.578 --> 02:45.311
we would have all been shot or hanged.

02:45.346 --> 02:46.525
I'm not...

02:47.282 --> 02:49.382
I am a judge. I know the law.

02:49.417 --> 02:51.284
And I make my judgments
after careful thought

02:51.319 --> 02:53.719
and consideration,
after weighing all sides.

02:53.755 --> 02:56.289
But back at the farm,
in a moment like that...

02:56.324 --> 02:57.957
You don't have time to think.

03:03.431 --> 03:05.131
How do you reconcile it?

03:15.476 --> 03:16.809
You don't.

03:19.681 --> 03:22.081
You just carry it with you
for the next time.

03:23.518 --> 03:25.230
I prefer the law.

03:26.023 --> 03:28.150
And I prefer farming, but...

03:28.723 --> 03:30.323
here we are.

03:31.326 --> 03:33.225
Here we are.

<i>£47 to replace a mirror?</i>

04:25.655 --> 04:28.522
- Everyone looks in a looking glass.
- What, in the bottom corner?

04:28.558 --> 04:30.925
The crack's still conspicuous
and only getting worse.

04:30.960 --> 04:33.561
- It had to be replaced.
- And what of this gown

04:33.596 --> 04:36.097
that Zipporah says
you're having tailored?

04:36.132 --> 04:37.999
I think it necessary that I be dressed

04:38.034 --> 04:41.369
- for our future engagements, don't you?
- Necessary?

04:41.404 --> 04:43.938
Sometimes I think you have more
dresses than I have buttons.

04:46.103 --> 04:48.342
It is for appearances, Benedict.

04:48.378 --> 04:49.910
Yes, appearances. Exactly.

04:49.946 --> 04:51.746
Which are everything

04:51.781 --> 04:54.215
if you want to be welcomed into
the houses of influence here.

04:54.250 --> 04:56.584
Do it by halves and we'll find
ourselves lumped in

04:56.619 --> 04:58.740
with the nouveau riche.

04:59.489 --> 05:01.656
Believe me, I'm thinking of
our future as much as you are.

05:01.691 --> 05:03.891
Yes, and I'm thinking
of how to pay for it.

05:05.028 --> 05:06.727
Mr. Parker to see you, sir.

05:10.633 --> 05:12.667
Excuse me, Mrs. Arnold.

05:12.702 --> 05:15.369
I need a moment alone
with this gentleman.

05:15.405 --> 05:17.071
Of course.

05:21.511 --> 05:23.377
<i>Is your crew ready?</i>

05:23.413 --> 05:25.179
<i>I'm down one man, thanks to Brewster,</i>

05:25.214 --> 05:27.448
<i>but I'll fill that in today.</i>

05:27.483 --> 05:31.018
Good. Then leave straightaway.

05:31.054 --> 05:34.322
I've marked the location
for the exchange.

05:34.357 --> 05:36.390
It's a mill off the Connecticut shore

05:36.426 --> 05:37.858
near the town of Lyme.

05:40.129 --> 05:43.597
There's precisely £500 here
drawn from the commissariat,

05:43.633 --> 05:45.833
and Colonel Cooke will expect
every single guinea delivered.

05:45.868 --> 05:49.570
<i>- Do you understand?
- I won't touch the ransom, sir, but...</i>

05:50.141 --> 05:52.540
<i>it does make the job more dangerous.</i>

05:52.575 --> 05:55.609
<i>I'll expect the rewards
are worth the risk.</i>

05:55.645 --> 05:58.245
The rewards will come
once I establish a regiment

05:58.281 --> 06:00.848
and find myself in need of a carrier

06:00.883 --> 06:02.983
for undocumented goods.

06:03.019 --> 06:04.685
What sort of undocumented goods?

06:04.721 --> 06:07.054
Tobacco, silk, indigo.

06:07.090 --> 06:10.324
Any spoils that this army can spare.

06:10.360 --> 06:11.792
Sir.

06:26.376 --> 06:28.109
George gave me a pound.

06:28.144 --> 06:30.644
- You should have made it six!
- Stop!

06:30.680 --> 06:33.314
Follow me! Come on.

06:33.349 --> 06:36.450
- Which way?
- Just this way.

06:36.486 --> 06:38.285
Right, you get an hour.

06:38.321 --> 06:40.654
And there's the old bawd.

06:40.690 --> 06:42.857
Loo up, gents.

06:46.566 --> 06:48.162
<i>For Benedict Arnold?</i>

06:48.197 --> 06:49.497
<i>No way, Parker.</i>

06:49.532 --> 06:51.520
<i>I don't care how much he pays.</i>

06:52.521 --> 06:54.368
It's five shilling, Meigs.

06:54.806 --> 06:55.870
It's an easy job.

06:55.905 --> 06:57.838
Like the last one
you did for that snake?

06:57.874 --> 06:59.340
I heard how that fell down.

06:59.375 --> 07:01.175
That was different.

07:01.210 --> 07:03.677
I ain't rowing to Connecticut
to trade with skinners.

07:03.713 --> 07:05.746
Hey, hey, friend, look.

07:05.782 --> 07:07.381
Now, I bet you get that dimber there

07:07.417 --> 07:09.283
for a pair of farthings.

07:09.829 --> 07:12.052
Told you, I got a woman.

07:12.088 --> 07:14.288
Right, right, trying to make
the coin stretch

07:14.323 --> 07:15.623
till she gets back.

07:15.658 --> 07:17.892
I say gets back from where?

07:17.927 --> 07:19.860
And you don't say.

07:19.896 --> 07:22.430
Ah, there it is!

07:22.465 --> 07:25.533
Looks like you're not stretching
nothing at this lanterloo.

07:25.568 --> 07:26.801
You're right.

07:36.779 --> 07:39.647
Hi, boys. For us?

07:50.059 --> 07:51.959
No, not for me.

07:53.863 --> 07:56.397
The job, how long?

07:56.432 --> 07:57.798
A week, maybe.

07:59.435 --> 08:00.634
Seen any combat?

08:00.670 --> 08:01.969
Seen battle.

08:02.004 --> 08:04.092
Fought a lot worse than skinners.

08:04.474 --> 08:06.720
Pay is three shillings.

08:07.143 --> 08:09.310
You told him five.

08:09.345 --> 08:11.145
Yeah.

08:11.180 --> 08:12.934
But I know him.

08:13.416 --> 08:15.416
And he isn't desperate.

08:21.157 --> 08:23.028
As you were.

08:23.793 --> 08:25.759
I suspected they would need a supplement

08:25.795 --> 08:28.028
for such an uneven exchange.

08:28.064 --> 08:29.730
This money makes it perfect.

08:29.765 --> 08:31.765
Makes what perfect?

08:32.668 --> 08:34.371
Our alibi.

08:35.332 --> 08:38.606
Muster a dozen men from the
old ranks, Roger's men.

08:38.640 --> 08:41.140
Disguise yourself
as bandits from the north

08:41.177 --> 08:45.112
and track Arnold's smugglers from the
port to wherever the exchange is.

08:45.147 --> 08:47.147
Ambush the whole lot.

08:47.183 --> 08:48.716
Divvy the ransom as you see fit.

08:48.751 --> 08:50.317
The whole lot?

08:50.353 --> 08:53.554
The rebels, the Tories,
and especially the hostages.

08:57.159 --> 08:58.959
No survivors.

08:59.439 --> 09:01.862
- And you, sir?
- I must remain here.

09:03.299 --> 09:06.133
- Alibi.
- Yes, sir.

09:16.145 --> 09:17.845
Please, please tell the warden

09:17.880 --> 09:19.747
that I know many officers in service.

09:19.782 --> 09:21.348
My name is Philomena Cheer.

09:21.384 --> 09:23.684
<i>I even served the Crown
with Major André!</i>

09:23.719 --> 09:26.186
<i>I can prove it. Please!</i>

09:26.222 --> 09:28.489
Now, this one ain't
your typical smuggler.

09:29.892 --> 09:32.793
He put a hatchet in one of
my crew from 20 foot out.

09:33.640 --> 09:35.496
Don't get sleepy on him.

09:46.375 --> 09:48.488
I thought you had seen combat.

09:49.656 --> 09:51.378
I seen him.

09:51.825 --> 09:53.480
<i>I know him.</i>

09:53.516 --> 09:56.037
Know him? How?

09:57.163 --> 10:00.688
Tried to kill each other
couple years back.

10:37.210 --> 10:40.920
Then pull down the stalk and...

10:40.920 --> 10:43.187
wrap around the sash.

10:43.222 --> 10:46.190
- And the hair?
- It's the corn silk.

10:47.046 --> 10:49.026
Keep it dry. It'll last longer.

10:49.061 --> 10:50.258
Thank you.

10:54.967 --> 10:56.867
Are you Anna Strong?

10:57.904 --> 10:59.770
I am.

10:59.806 --> 11:01.572
May I help you, Lieutenant...

11:01.607 --> 11:02.896
Randall.

11:03.725 --> 11:06.210
I understand you and Major
Tallmadge are quite close.

11:07.705 --> 11:09.538
I don't know where you heard that, sir,

11:09.573 --> 11:13.008
but I have a husband in Philadelphia.

11:13.043 --> 11:15.077
And I hardly think this is your concern.

11:15.112 --> 11:16.611
I...

11:20.084 --> 11:23.792
I need someone who has the major's ear.

11:24.355 --> 11:27.522
I heard what you tried to do for Corporal
Carney's wife before she got drummed out

11:27.558 --> 11:29.591
and that you're sympathetic
to the conditions of the camp.

11:29.626 --> 11:31.893
You're a Dragoon.
Why can't you bend his ear?

11:31.929 --> 11:33.695
Because he despises me.

11:35.833 --> 11:37.399
You're the one he beat.

11:38.936 --> 11:40.502
The man who shot that prisoner.

11:40.537 --> 11:42.371
That matter was brought
before the provost,

11:42.406 --> 11:43.839
and I was found to be in the right.

11:43.874 --> 11:46.064
And I'm still in the right.

11:46.877 --> 11:49.344
Did you know the entire regiment
is waiting on a year's pay?

11:49.380 --> 11:51.246
I do, but Major Tallmadge
isn't in charge of that...

11:51.281 --> 11:54.282
He can speak to the commander.
I know Washington favors him.

11:54.318 --> 11:57.185
And they need to be warned of
what's happening among their ranks.

11:57.221 --> 11:58.920
Warned of what?

12:00.324 --> 12:02.657
I fear if their grievances
are not properly addressed,

12:02.693 --> 12:04.893
they shall seek restitution in blood.

12:07.295 --> 12:09.164
Let Tallmadge know.

12:39.576 --> 12:41.430
<i>Excuse me, is the lady
of the house home?</i>

12:41.465 --> 12:45.100
<i>- Who's asking?
- I used to work here with Mrs. Arnold.</i>

12:45.135 --> 12:47.836
<i>Oh. Well, she doesn't want business...</i>

12:47.871 --> 12:49.037
<i>and your job is taken.</i>

12:49.073 --> 12:50.505
I understand.

12:50.541 --> 12:53.375
I do not wish to impose,
but can I leave a message?

12:53.410 --> 12:55.510
Mrs. Arnold doesn't have
any time for any messages.

12:55.546 --> 12:56.678
<i>Abigail!</i>

12:57.981 --> 13:00.715
Cicero, is that you? Come in, come in!

13:00.751 --> 13:03.985
I'm sorry, Mrs. Arnold.
I know you didn't expect us.

13:04.021 --> 13:06.655
Don't apologize. You're a welcome sight.

13:06.690 --> 13:09.925
I know it's been a while since we
were sent to the Continental side.

13:09.960 --> 13:13.228
And I was just telling her
her position's taken.

13:13.263 --> 13:15.163
And now she is getting it back.

13:15.199 --> 13:16.665
I'll give you an extra crown

13:16.700 --> 13:18.965
if you can clear out
your things within the hour.

13:19.269 --> 13:20.802
I should warn you,

13:20.838 --> 13:23.438
a Negro vagrant's
been skulking around here.

13:23.474 --> 13:25.540
<i>Said he came down from up north</i>

13:25.576 --> 13:27.709
looking for her and her boy.

13:27.744 --> 13:29.611
Tall, shifty-looking.

13:29.646 --> 13:32.380
- Did he say his name?
- So you <i> do</i> know him.

13:32.416 --> 13:34.716
It's not longer your concern, Zipporah.

13:34.751 --> 13:36.118
Clear out your thing

13:36.925 --> 13:38.854
He'll be back, Mrs. Arnold.

13:38.889 --> 13:40.655
Just you see.

13:43.427 --> 13:45.227
And remember, I'm still Peggy,

13:45.262 --> 13:47.229
not Mrs. Arnold.

13:47.264 --> 13:49.097
Now come, we have much to discuss.

13:52.970 --> 13:54.736
One! Two! Three!

13:57.741 --> 14:00.442
One! Two! Three!

14:05.382 --> 14:06.882
Get him out.

14:16.026 --> 14:17.592
I know you.

14:17.628 --> 14:20.262
You're a Ranger.

14:28.138 --> 14:31.273
He just said you're a Queen's Ranger.

14:31.308 --> 14:32.641
Well, that's something you mention

14:32.676 --> 14:34.576
before you start trading men
across the Sound.

14:34.611 --> 14:38.277
Used to be with them, but not no more.

14:38.949 --> 14:40.916
Who you trading me for?

14:42.152 --> 14:46.755
Some local magistrate
and his son... Woodhull.

14:57.034 --> 14:58.733
<i>Benedict?</i>

14:58.769 --> 15:01.903
I waited past the noon bell
to meet with him, Peggy.

15:01.939 --> 15:04.940
Even then, Clinton adjourned
my council until the ninth.

15:04.975 --> 15:07.309
And he was in with just a young
adjutant the whole time.

15:07.344 --> 15:09.244
God only knows what they were doing.

15:10.781 --> 15:13.615
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Mrs. Arnold!

15:15.018 --> 15:18.653
Benedict, you remember
Abigail and her son, Cicero.

15:18.689 --> 15:21.723
Yes, they were in service
here before my residence.

15:21.758 --> 15:24.326
Well, they've returned, and I
thought it fit to reinstate them.

15:24.361 --> 15:28.129
Peggy, I have given you many liberties,
but this is not one of them.

15:28.165 --> 15:30.098
And now I have three to board.

15:30.133 --> 15:31.900
- I sent Zipporah away.
- What?

15:31.935 --> 15:33.835
I wouldn't have taken such action

15:33.870 --> 15:36.271
if I did not believe it
to be in your favor.

15:36.306 --> 15:38.807
Allow me to be the judge
of what is in my favor.

15:42.246 --> 15:44.112
It's been over a month since we sent you

15:44.147 --> 15:45.780
to deliver Major André's uniform.

15:46.304 --> 15:47.716
The Continentals do not honor

15:47.751 --> 15:49.651
the freedom papers we were given, sir.

15:49.686 --> 15:50.919
So you were captured?

15:50.954 --> 15:54.623
No, but passage back was difficult.

15:58.095 --> 16:01.162
Why must you bring a reminder
of André into our home?

16:01.198 --> 16:03.431
The royal officers
blame me for his mistakes.

16:03.467 --> 16:05.033
Dearest, don't you see?

16:05.068 --> 16:06.368
By bringing in people of his life,

16:06.403 --> 16:09.204
it shows you honor his
memory and sacrifice,

16:09.239 --> 16:11.239
just as those officers do.

16:13.210 --> 16:14.709
I'll allow it.

16:14.745 --> 16:17.502
On a provisional basis.

16:18.377 --> 16:21.182
But dock two crowns on account
of her son's lodging.

16:24.755 --> 16:26.254
Do not worry.

16:26.290 --> 16:28.423
All this will soon be forgotten.

16:46.877 --> 16:49.177
You think they'll take us
back to Setauket or York City?

16:49.212 --> 16:51.946
I hope Setauket. I assume York City.

16:51.982 --> 16:53.948
That's what I was thinking.

16:53.984 --> 16:56.051
Cooke'll want to see what he paid for.

16:59.476 --> 17:01.342
Could be a chance
to get a look at his books.

17:01.879 --> 17:04.224
Now you want to spy on Jonathan Cooke?

17:04.261 --> 17:06.594
Well, with your help, of course.

17:06.630 --> 17:07.796
That's not what I meant.

17:07.830 --> 17:10.598
No, I know, but think about it.

17:10.634 --> 17:11.965
He handles the war chest.

17:12.002 --> 17:13.568
If I can get to him...

17:15.638 --> 17:17.505
we can find out where
their pounds are spent.

17:17.540 --> 17:19.973
And where they send their sterling

17:20.010 --> 17:21.976
will tell you where
they'll send their army.

17:22.900 --> 17:24.813
"Money is a good soldier."

17:24.848 --> 17:26.915
Don't quote Shakespeare.
That's my trick.

17:26.950 --> 17:29.250
Here. You want a bite?

17:31.788 --> 17:33.188
Bribery now, huh?

17:33.223 --> 17:34.789
Are there no ends you won't go to?

17:34.825 --> 17:36.958
Haven't found one yet.

17:36.993 --> 17:39.627
To think I dreamed one day
you'd be an officer

17:39.663 --> 17:41.062
in the King's Army.

17:42.332 --> 17:43.832
No.

17:45.102 --> 17:47.102
No, Thomas was always
the fighter, not me.

17:47.137 --> 17:48.737
My Thomas was older and stronger.

17:48.772 --> 17:51.406
<i>You</i> were always the fighter.

18:03.487 --> 18:05.820
You know, the truth is
when I was a boy...

18:08.258 --> 18:10.759
I wanted to wear that
redcoat more than anything.

18:16.533 --> 18:20.435
If you truly want to get your
eyes on the Crown's ledgers,

18:20.470 --> 18:22.036
you're gonna have to entice Cooke

18:22.072 --> 18:24.372
with something more
than ham and cabbage.

18:26.410 --> 18:28.009
What do you suggest?

18:31.548 --> 18:32.881
They've arrived.

18:32.916 --> 18:34.682
It's time.

20:02.945 --> 20:04.378
Caleb?

20:06.048 --> 20:07.981
What have you done to him?

20:08.017 --> 20:09.383
<i>Eh?</i>

20:09.418 --> 20:11.818
There weren't no terms
for his constitution,

20:12.161 --> 20:13.527
just that he was living.

20:13.562 --> 20:15.629
Well, I'm sure we can find
a way to even it out.

20:15.664 --> 20:19.333
No, no, there'll be
no blood for blood today.

20:22.538 --> 20:23.837
You Judge Woodhull?

20:25.441 --> 20:27.341
- Send him over.
- Send the money.

20:28.611 --> 20:30.177
Brewster for the one.

20:32.047 --> 20:33.591
The money for the other.

20:34.516 --> 20:35.749
You pick first trade.

20:35.784 --> 20:37.517
- I'll go.
- Me.

20:39.722 --> 20:41.388
The judge.

21:01.710 --> 21:04.444
It's all right.

21:08.083 --> 21:10.617
Is that... that's Akin-balls.

21:10.653 --> 21:13.253
<i>Simcoe's gonna love seeing that scalp.</i>

21:13.289 --> 21:15.355
Now the son.

21:30.606 --> 21:32.306
Something ain't right.

21:36.912 --> 21:38.912
You have any more friends here?

21:38.948 --> 21:40.914
- What?
- It ain't them.

21:40.950 --> 21:43.550
Get...

21:54.663 --> 21:56.496
The mill!

21:56.532 --> 21:59.833
- Get to the mill!
<i>- Come on, get inside!</i>

21:59.868 --> 22:01.501
Move!

22:03.072 --> 22:04.604
Come on, hurry!

22:10.546 --> 22:12.245
God damn it, come on!

22:12.281 --> 22:14.581
Cover the windows.

22:19.621 --> 22:21.922
- You goddamn priggers!
- What the hell was that?!

22:21.957 --> 22:23.824
- You brought men!
- Hey, the enemy is out there!

22:23.859 --> 22:25.258
They fired on all of us.

22:25.294 --> 22:27.728
Now lower your weapons!
Cover the window!

22:40.146 --> 22:42.146
Go on, get the boat ready.

22:42.181 --> 22:43.748
I'll hold them off.

22:49.555 --> 22:51.355
There! Go out there!

22:56.829 --> 22:58.396
Should we reload?

22:58.431 --> 23:00.164
No, he's empty, too.

23:00.199 --> 23:02.500
We've been looking for you, deserter.

23:02.535 --> 23:04.001
Why come back now?

23:04.037 --> 23:07.438
Don't know. Why kill your own side?

23:07.473 --> 23:09.740
Let's answer him, boys!

23:18.151 --> 23:19.684
Who else saw me?

23:30.263 --> 23:31.929
Hey!

24:01.994 --> 24:03.794
There's two behind the rocks.

24:05.431 --> 24:07.264
Three behind the woodpile.

24:19.212 --> 24:21.245
<i>They got the money.
What are they still doing here?</i>

24:21.280 --> 24:23.714
Who the hell are they?

24:23.750 --> 24:25.316
Looked like Vermonters.

24:26.352 --> 24:28.419
What, with bayonets?

24:32.692 --> 24:34.164
He's, uh...

24:35.128 --> 24:36.861
He's still out there. We should...

24:36.896 --> 24:38.329
- He's gone.
- He fell.

24:38.364 --> 24:40.398
He's gone! Look at me.

24:40.433 --> 24:42.800
He's gone. But you're not.

24:46.406 --> 24:48.105
- You still with me?
- Yeah.

24:48.141 --> 24:49.807
We're gonna need all you've got as well.

24:49.842 --> 24:51.375
Come on.

24:56.315 --> 24:58.115
I count five more at the rear.

24:58.151 --> 25:00.885
That's 10. We gotta surrender.

25:02.388 --> 25:03.821
They're here to kill us.

25:03.856 --> 25:05.756
We don't know what side they fight on.

25:05.792 --> 25:07.858
- It doesn't matter.
<i>- No, he's right.</i>

25:07.894 --> 25:09.994
If they're skinners,
we should talk to them.

25:10.029 --> 25:11.862
If they're cowboys, he should.

25:11.898 --> 25:13.197
Now, we'll make a white flag

25:13.232 --> 25:14.799
and we'll...

25:26.045 --> 25:28.510
- Good day, General.
- Is it?

25:29.248 --> 25:30.815
Madeira.

25:33.586 --> 25:35.386
I feel as though I should apologize

25:35.421 --> 25:36.754
over the Brewster mishap.

25:36.789 --> 25:38.255
No need.

25:38.291 --> 25:40.391
Fault lies in the principles
of our fellow officers.

25:40.426 --> 25:43.894
Colonel Cooke does seem to
value commerce over justice.

25:43.930 --> 25:45.152
And Clin...

25:46.265 --> 25:47.765
and others are no better.

25:47.800 --> 25:49.133
Couldn't agree more.

25:49.168 --> 25:50.801
This war would be over if we had leaders

25:50.837 --> 25:52.703
who were unafraid to finish it.

26:05.852 --> 26:07.216
Forgive me,

26:07.820 --> 26:10.621
but it seems something
else is troubling you.

26:11.095 --> 26:13.123
Did you manage to resolve the matter

26:13.159 --> 26:14.291
of the prisoner exchange?

26:14.327 --> 26:16.093
Yes, yes. It's all been arranged.

26:16.128 --> 26:17.528
Ah, good.

26:21.300 --> 26:23.167
Do you have a wife, Simcoe?

26:23.202 --> 26:26.443
No, but one day, I hope.

26:26.739 --> 26:29.655
You hope because you lack
experience of it.

26:30.109 --> 26:32.776
Wives are wonderful creatures,
to be sure,

26:32.812 --> 26:34.645
but they sometimes press for favors

26:34.680 --> 26:36.647
that go against our better judgment.

26:36.682 --> 26:39.517
- Like that woman you had arrested.
- What woman?

26:39.552 --> 26:41.719
I saw her at Bridewell
while Brewster was there,

26:41.754 --> 26:44.128
and then at Kennedy House
not long before.

26:44.524 --> 26:46.657
Oh, Philomena Cheer.

26:46.692 --> 26:49.093
No, she has nothing to...
why do you say this?

26:49.128 --> 26:51.295
I merely observed a disagreement

26:51.330 --> 26:53.297
between her and Mrs. Arnold that night.

26:53.332 --> 26:55.833
What night? At Kennedy House?

26:55.868 --> 26:58.602
Mmm, though I may have
misread the exchange.

26:58.638 --> 27:00.137
Excuse me.

27:21.427 --> 27:23.494
They're gonna try to burn us out.

27:24.334 --> 27:26.096
All right, we have to...
we have to mount a sortie.

27:26.132 --> 27:29.400
We need to try to find
a way to surprise them,

27:29.435 --> 27:33.003
try to take out as many as we can
while we still have a chance.

27:39.045 --> 27:40.377
This leads to the trace.

27:40.413 --> 27:41.727
An escape?

27:42.348 --> 27:44.682
No, no, but a least a way for
one of us to get behind them,

27:44.717 --> 27:46.684
create a flank or some kind
of distraction at least.

27:46.719 --> 27:47.941
I'm going.

27:48.521 --> 27:51.622
Abe, Abe, no.

27:51.657 --> 27:53.891
I'll wait for your signal, then
I'll draw their fire towards me.

27:53.926 --> 27:55.659
- Abe, you're in no condition...
- It won't matter.

27:55.695 --> 27:58.028
There's still 10 of them, 4 of us.

27:58.064 --> 27:59.496
<i> Six.</i>

28:04.203 --> 28:05.970
There's six of us.

28:31.464 --> 28:32.763
- Hey.
- Hmm?

28:32.798 --> 28:34.431
The torches are nearly done.

28:34.467 --> 28:36.367
- Get ready.
- Righto.

28:40.806 --> 28:42.473
<i>Ah, there we go.</i>

28:42.508 --> 28:44.074
That's something.

28:54.086 --> 28:56.620
Fisher, hey, what's taking so long?

28:58.624 --> 29:00.257
You've got enough loot. Now come on!

29:16.776 --> 29:19.777
<i>Come on, hurry. He's
waiting for our signal.</i>

29:55.514 --> 29:57.181
<i>Fire's almost ready.</i>

30:20.740 --> 30:23.107
Where the hell did Thorburn get off to?

30:23.142 --> 30:24.675
And Cole and Mackey?

30:24.710 --> 30:26.944
Chasing down stragglers.
It doesn't matter.

30:26.979 --> 30:28.679
There's only a few left in there.

30:28.714 --> 30:30.581
We'll smoke 'em out.

30:30.616 --> 30:31.915
Now cover me.

30:43.062 --> 30:45.195
He must be in position by now, eh?

30:47.466 --> 30:49.199
You ready?

30:49.235 --> 30:50.701
Always.

30:50.736 --> 30:52.870
All right, come on.

31:00.646 --> 31:02.012
Light each corner.

31:02.047 --> 31:04.047
I'll throw one on the roof
for good measure.

31:28.107 --> 31:29.573
No!

31:34.446 --> 31:36.513
Come around!

31:44.323 --> 31:46.523
Retreat! Retreat!

33:10.907 --> 33:13.741
Excuse me, Colonel Hamilton?

33:13.776 --> 33:16.110
Uh, I have an urgent matter
to discuss with you.

33:18.715 --> 33:20.181
Why come to me with this?

33:20.216 --> 33:22.783
Because Major Tallmadge
is away on a mission.

33:22.819 --> 33:25.619
What mission? Never mind.

33:25.655 --> 33:27.989
And pay this warning no mind either.

33:28.024 --> 33:29.557
There are always rumors of discontent.

33:29.592 --> 33:31.625
These are not just rumors, I fear.

33:31.661 --> 33:33.694
And the grievance is not
just among the enlisted,

33:33.730 --> 33:35.129
but the officers as well.

33:35.164 --> 33:36.831
Well, perhaps they should revolt, then.

33:36.866 --> 33:38.132
What?

33:38.167 --> 33:40.401
It could be just what this army needs.

33:40.436 --> 33:42.203
I... I don't understand.

33:42.238 --> 33:44.872
I have written to Congress
about the needs of this army

33:44.907 --> 33:46.474
more times than I can count.

33:46.509 --> 33:48.075
How can we expect them to listen to us

33:48.111 --> 33:49.710
when they don't even
listen to each other?

33:49.746 --> 33:51.679
They can't all be like that.

33:51.714 --> 33:54.849
Madam, you don't know
these men like I do.

33:54.884 --> 33:57.752
My husband serves in Congress, sir.

33:58.855 --> 34:00.788
Well, then what do you need me for?

34:01.231 --> 34:03.124
Or the general?

34:03.159 --> 34:05.526
You can write to Congress
yourself and secure the bounties

34:05.561 --> 34:08.237
and back pay we need
to forestall mutiny.

34:48.277 --> 34:50.337
<i>"My Dearest Selah,</i>

34:50.373 --> 34:52.540
<i>I write you with news that I...</i>

34:56.012 --> 34:59.706
<i>am now safely
in the New Windsor Encampment.</i>

35:00.383 --> 35:01.782
<i>It has been too long,</i>

35:01.818 --> 35:04.419
<i>and there is so much I must tell you,</i>

35:05.420 --> 35:08.923
<i>but I write you this letter
now not only as your wife,</i>

35:08.958 --> 35:12.726
<i>but as someone who is witness to
a growing crisis here in camp.</i>

35:13.345 --> 35:16.297
<i>Conditions and pay for
the men here are unfair,</i>

35:16.332 --> 35:18.933
<i>even cruel, and I fear some soldiers</i>

35:18.968 --> 35:21.602
<i>are on the verge of a great revolt,</i>

35:21.637 --> 35:24.940
<i>one which could upend our entire cause.</i>

35:25.857 --> 35:30.277
<i>We need someone here like you,
someone from Congress,</i>

35:30.313 --> 35:33.914
<i>to see with his own eyes
and hear with his own ears</i>

35:33.950 --> 35:36.250
<i>the plight of the army</i>

35:36.285 --> 35:38.319
<i>before it becomes too late.</i>

35:40.223 --> 35:44.592
<i>I beg of you to come here
as soon as you can, Selah,</i>

35:44.627 --> 35:46.327
<i>for all our sake."</i>

36:03.895 --> 36:05.513
<i>Miss Cheer.</i>

36:06.189 --> 36:07.681
You attest to have been in the service

36:07.717 --> 36:09.216
of the Crown at one time.

36:09.901 --> 36:12.520
Yes. I assisted Major André.

36:12.555 --> 36:15.289
- How?
- I helped him persuade

36:15.324 --> 36:17.424
a Continental general, Charles Lee,

36:17.460 --> 36:19.693
to recognize the favor of Great Britain.

36:19.729 --> 36:21.629
Charles Lee?

36:21.664 --> 36:23.797
But I don't understand
how that could have led

36:23.833 --> 36:26.376
to these accusations against me.

36:27.203 --> 36:30.771
I can't imagine who would name
me as disloyal to the Crown.

36:32.975 --> 36:35.976
A Mr. Frederick Morgan
testified against you.

36:36.012 --> 36:37.378
<i>Freddy?</i>

36:37.929 --> 36:40.181
What would he have to do
with any of this?

36:41.184 --> 36:42.883
I only know him be...

36:44.720 --> 36:45.953
What?

36:47.590 --> 36:49.056
What is it?

36:51.027 --> 36:52.560
I can grant you exoneration

36:52.595 --> 36:55.162
if you have counter-evidence
which proves out.

36:56.332 --> 36:59.900
Did he tell you who paid his account?

36:59.936 --> 37:03.070
Hmm? When he arranged my hair?

37:03.105 --> 37:04.738
No.

37:06.776 --> 37:08.809
It was Major André.

37:11.480 --> 37:15.349
And only when he wished
for me to resemble...

37:18.754 --> 37:20.688
Miss Shippen.

37:24.627 --> 37:27.561
Did he not mention that?

37:30.967 --> 37:33.267
Should I be concerned, Abigail,

37:33.302 --> 37:36.370
about this man Zipporah mentioned?

37:36.405 --> 37:38.172
Oh, I think not.

37:38.207 --> 37:40.641
Maybe someone I knew from the market.

37:40.676 --> 37:42.376
Well, if it is a worry,
I hope you would trust me

37:42.411 --> 37:45.179
as I do you.

37:45.214 --> 37:48.916
Benedict, you've come home
just in time f... f...

37:50.386 --> 37:52.753
You have taken me for a fool!

37:52.788 --> 37:54.288
Get out!

37:55.825 --> 37:58.959
You lying, lascivious wench.

37:58.995 --> 38:00.995
I have given you everything of me!

38:01.030 --> 38:02.563
Everything!

38:02.598 --> 38:04.732
My money, my country.

38:04.767 --> 38:07.201
- God, my honor!
- Benedict what are you talking about?

38:07.236 --> 38:09.104
John André!

38:09.772 --> 38:12.273
I've spoken to your rival, Miss Cheer,

38:12.308 --> 38:15.531
and learned how you used your
molly friend to manipulate me.

38:15.566 --> 38:16.501
Whatever that woman said...

38:16.526 --> 38:18.012
And like a blind man,
I refused to believe

38:18.047 --> 38:20.447
that you pined for that worm,

38:20.483 --> 38:23.717
despite his pathetic bloody
efforts to win you back.

38:27.523 --> 38:29.290
Oh, yes.

38:29.325 --> 38:31.292
The good major demanded...

38:31.327 --> 38:36.196
no, begged that we break
off our engagement.

38:36.232 --> 38:39.500
£10,000 he offered to win your hand.

38:39.535 --> 38:42.102
Not to worry, I happily informed

38:42.138 --> 38:44.905
our hanged friend
that his light-heeled whore

38:44.940 --> 38:47.608
was already well broken in.

38:50.780 --> 38:52.246
You're right.

38:54.650 --> 38:56.684
You're absolutely right.

38:59.255 --> 39:02.489
I wish <i> you</i> would have died
instead of John.

39:04.060 --> 39:07.528
I wish it with your every breath!

39:08.698 --> 39:10.164
Good.

39:10.199 --> 39:13.434
Then you wish for a gull and a coward!
