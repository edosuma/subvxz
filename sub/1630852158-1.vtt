00:03.312 --> 00:04.846
<i>Many years ago,</i>

00:04.914 --> 00:07.816
<i>the once great city of Atlantis
ruled the planet above.</i>

00:07.884 --> 00:10.485
<i>But after countless
uprisings and costly wars,</i>

00:10.552 --> 00:13.722
<i>King Nereus made a decision
to withdraw from the world</i>

00:13.788 --> 00:15.624
<i>and disappear from history.</i>

00:15.690 --> 00:17.826
<i>We built a paradise
under the sea,</i>

00:17.894 --> 00:20.428
<i>a world in harmony
with all around us.</i>

00:22.530 --> 00:24.367
<i>As the outsiders
developed more advanced</i>

00:24.432 --> 00:26.035
<i>means of transportation,</i>

00:26.102 --> 00:28.371
<i>the chances of discovering
our underwater kingdom</i>

00:28.436 --> 00:29.906
<i>became too great.</i>

00:29.972 --> 00:32.275
<i>We spoke to the wind, the sea,</i>

00:32.341 --> 00:34.076
<i>and the creatures around us,</i>

00:34.143 --> 00:37.346
<i>asking for their protection
from those who live on land.</i>

00:37.412 --> 00:40.182
<i>Yes, as any parasite
that enters our body,</i>

00:40.249 --> 00:42.817
<i>we destroyed each
and every creature</i>

00:42.885 --> 00:45.487
<i>and vessel that
ventured too close.</i>

00:46.788 --> 00:49.025
<i>But the outsiders
could never stay away,</i>

00:49.091 --> 00:51.127
<i>leave well enough alone.</i>

00:51.193 --> 00:53.628
<i>In secret, they gathered
their great forces</i>

00:53.695 --> 00:55.097
<i>with one objective:</i>

00:55.164 --> 00:57.266
<i>to invade and destroy
our kingdom.</i>

00:57.333 --> 01:00.036
<i>But no weapons of man
are a match for the Hydra,</i>

01:00.102 --> 01:01.736
<i>our great protector.</i>

01:01.803 --> 01:05.107
<i>Many lives were lost
and the outsiders, humiliated,</i>

01:05.174 --> 01:07.575
<i>retreated back to land.</i>

01:07.642 --> 01:10.379
<i>Yet we know the outsiders
will return.</i>

01:10.445 --> 01:13.049
<i>They will never be
content unless they can own</i>

01:13.115 --> 01:17.353
<i>what is not theirs, unless they
can destroy all that is good.</i>

01:17.420 --> 01:20.488
<i>And for that day, we prepare.</i>

01:28.830 --> 01:30.465
I don't like the
look of that weather.

01:30.532 --> 01:33.735
Planes fly in and out of
storms all the time.

01:33.802 --> 01:35.438
Come on. You barely got
any sleep last night.

01:35.503 --> 01:39.208
Just try and get at least
a few hours in before we land.

01:39.275 --> 01:41.110
Despite you taking out my
points on whale migration,

01:41.177 --> 01:43.712
algae blooms and
sea lion populations,

01:43.778 --> 01:45.348
I do know what
I'm talking about,

01:45.414 --> 01:47.450
and this is
a lot of turbulence.

01:47.515 --> 01:49.018
I only took out those points

01:49.085 --> 01:50.920
'cause we have yet
to verify them yet.

01:50.987 --> 01:52.487
We're the first speakers up.

01:52.554 --> 01:55.224
We set the tone
for the whole conference.

01:55.291 --> 01:56.993
We're not published,
nor do we have any funding.

01:57.059 --> 01:58.526
And they're not
gonna give it to us

01:58.593 --> 02:01.529
if we don't have
anything to present.

02:01.596 --> 02:04.166
I know, but it's just...

02:05.734 --> 02:07.136
Never mind.

02:09.005 --> 02:10.705
Plus, you slept on the couch,

02:10.772 --> 02:12.108
so how do you know if
I got any sleep last night?

02:18.080 --> 02:20.883
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're experiencing

02:20.950 --> 02:22.617
rougher than usual turbulence.

02:22.684 --> 02:25.388
Please keep your seatbelts
on all times. Thank you.

02:25.454 --> 02:27.589
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain.</i>

02:27.655 --> 02:30.625
<i>We'll be experiencing
some moderate turbulence.</i>

02:30.692 --> 02:32.627
<i>We ask that everyone
remain seated</i>

02:32.694 --> 02:34.163
<i>with your seatbelts fastened</i>

02:34.230 --> 02:36.132
<i>until we get through
this rough patch.</i>

02:36.198 --> 02:37.632
<i>Thank you.</i>

02:37.699 --> 02:38.800
There's something going on.

02:38.867 --> 02:40.336
We'll be fine.

02:40.403 --> 02:43.105
Look, Sam has gotten us back
home safely, right?

02:43.172 --> 02:44.106
Yeah.

02:47.276 --> 02:48.411
This is normal, right?

02:48.477 --> 02:49.811
Yeah, yeah.
This is normal.

02:49.879 --> 02:50.845
It's just turbulence.

02:50.913 --> 02:53.115
- Excuse me?
- Yes?

02:53.182 --> 02:55.217
This is normal, right?

02:55.284 --> 02:58.187
It's rougher than usual,
but we should be fine.

02:59.255 --> 03:00.189
See?

03:01.723 --> 03:04.759
I'll get you a complimentary
drink after this is over, okay?

03:04.826 --> 03:06.162
Yes.
Thank you.

03:06.228 --> 03:07.662
First thing I'm doing
when we get there

03:07.729 --> 03:11.800
is taking a long drag
of this bad boy.

03:11.866 --> 03:13.936
Start our honeymoon
vacation off right,

03:14.003 --> 03:17.339
then head straight to the beach.

03:17.406 --> 03:19.475
Mm, sounds perfect.

03:19.542 --> 03:21.077
I can't wait.

03:21.143 --> 03:22.945
Me either.

03:27.016 --> 03:28.350
Did you see that?

03:28.417 --> 03:29.952
Remain seated, please.

03:30.019 --> 03:31.753
Hey, wait!
Are we gonna be okay?

03:31.820 --> 03:33.155
- Remain seated...
- I'm really scared!

03:33.222 --> 03:34.722
- Are we being attacked?
- No.

03:34.789 --> 03:36.591
Keep your seatbelt on!

03:36.658 --> 03:38.194
What is going on?

03:38.260 --> 03:40.029
It's just very rough
turbulence, madam.

03:40.096 --> 03:42.364
Please stay in your seat and
keep your seatbelt fastened.

03:45.034 --> 03:47.769
Justin. Justin!
Justin, wake up!

03:47.836 --> 03:49.939
- What?
- I saw something.

03:54.176 --> 03:55.211
Captain!

03:55.277 --> 03:57.079
Captain, can you hear me?

03:57.146 --> 03:59.848
Captain, I'm gonna enact
the emergency override!

04:01.183 --> 04:02.750
Captain!

04:08.857 --> 04:10.593
That is not thunder
and lightning!

04:10.658 --> 04:12.428
Ma'am, please sit down!

04:12.495 --> 04:15.030
Hey, sit down and relax and let
the flight attendant do her job!

04:17.099 --> 04:18.334
Thank you.

04:18.400 --> 04:19.902
- Good?
- Yeah, yeah.

04:22.271 --> 04:23.239
Oh, my God.

04:25.107 --> 04:26.774
Ah!

04:26.841 --> 04:28.177
Are you okay?

04:28.244 --> 04:30.745
- What is happening?
- I don't know.

04:46.896 --> 04:48.663
- Justin!
- Midge!

04:57.039 --> 04:58.374
We don't know what's out there!

04:58.440 --> 05:01.177
I know there's
survivors out there!

05:01.243 --> 05:02.744
So I gotta go.

05:04.046 --> 05:05.680
Do you see anyone else?

05:06.714 --> 05:08.250
Uh...

05:08.317 --> 05:11.120
Oh, look!
I think there's survivors!

05:11.187 --> 05:13.455
Let go of me.

05:20.262 --> 05:22.164
My God!
There's other survivors!

05:22.231 --> 05:23.566
Are you hurt?

05:23.632 --> 05:26.569
I think I cut my leg
pretty bad.

05:39.747 --> 05:42.850
Have you seen anyone else?

05:42.918 --> 05:45.820
There was Rose back there.
I was with her.

05:48.257 --> 05:50.459
There's no one back there!

05:52.827 --> 05:54.463
Something has my leg!

05:54.530 --> 05:55.830
What?

05:58.067 --> 05:59.767
We have to swim! Come on!

07:44.640 --> 07:45.607
Please, help me!

07:47.343 --> 07:49.411
Help me!

08:01.223 --> 08:02.424
Del!

08:16.004 --> 08:17.840
Ah! Oh, my God!

08:17.906 --> 08:21.310
Owen! Owen!
Come on, get up!

08:24.613 --> 08:27.316
Help!

08:27.383 --> 08:28.951
Someone help!

08:29.017 --> 08:30.652
- Help!
- I'm coming!

08:30.719 --> 08:32.721
Help! Help!

08:32.788 --> 08:34.022
It's my husband!

08:34.089 --> 08:36.191
Please, help!

08:36.258 --> 08:38.394
Okay, it's all right.

08:38.460 --> 08:40.295
We're gonna pull him up
here together, okay?

08:40.362 --> 08:41.630
We can do it.
We can do it!

08:41.697 --> 08:43.098
On three, we're gonna pull him.

08:43.165 --> 08:45.601
Right here, right here!
Grab him right here!

08:45.667 --> 08:48.370
One, two, three...

08:52.775 --> 08:54.209
Okay, again!

08:54.276 --> 08:56.278
We can do this.
Are you ready?

08:57.780 --> 09:00.416
One, two, three...

09:03.919 --> 09:05.053
Okay, okay.

09:05.120 --> 09:06.555
Hey, you need
to shade his face

09:06.622 --> 09:07.689
so that he doesn't
get heatstroke, okay?

09:07.756 --> 09:08.857
- Here.
- Okay.

09:08.924 --> 09:10.959
Here.

09:11.794 --> 09:14.930
Look what he did to his hands.

09:17.599 --> 09:19.601
Hey, I'm gonna go look
for my husband.

09:19.668 --> 09:21.203
You gonna be okay?

09:21.270 --> 09:23.305
- Okay.
- Okay. I'll be right back.

09:23.372 --> 09:25.507
- Baby, you're going to make it.
- Del?

09:27.609 --> 09:29.845
It's okay.
Come on, wake up.

09:29.913 --> 09:33.382
Del!
Del!

09:33.449 --> 09:34.783
Vera!

09:34.850 --> 09:37.719
- Del?
- I'm here.

09:37.786 --> 09:38.787
- Baby!
- Vera!

09:38.854 --> 09:40.322
- Del!
- Vera, Vera!

09:40.389 --> 09:41.957
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm good.

09:42.024 --> 09:44.393
Okay, baby, I got you.
I'm gonna get you out, okay?

09:44.460 --> 09:45.994
Hey, hey, I need your help!

09:46.061 --> 09:47.796
- I'm stuck under the chairs.
- Please.

09:47.863 --> 09:49.531
Sorry, sweetie.

09:49.598 --> 09:51.333
Okay.

09:51.400 --> 09:52.701
Oh, God!

09:52.768 --> 09:54.269
Hey. What's your name?

09:54.336 --> 09:55.070
Ruth.

09:55.137 --> 09:56.171
My name is Vera.

09:56.238 --> 09:58.106
This is my husband, Del.

09:58.173 --> 09:59.408
I'm gonna need your help, okay?

09:59.475 --> 10:02.211
We need to lift this
off him, okay?

10:02.277 --> 10:03.779
We're gonna pull it off, okay?

10:03.846 --> 10:05.080
Wait, wait!
You're bleeding.

10:05.147 --> 10:06.548
- It's okay.
- Really badly.

10:06.615 --> 10:08.317
It's okay, it's okay.
You ready?

10:08.383 --> 10:09.685
Go! Pull!

10:09.751 --> 10:10.920
It's not working!

10:15.624 --> 10:17.092
Hey... are you okay?

10:17.159 --> 10:18.427
Yeah, yeah.

10:18.494 --> 10:19.461
Oh, baby...

10:23.265 --> 10:24.466
Are you okay?

10:24.533 --> 10:25.534
Oh, my God!

10:25.601 --> 10:27.236
It's fine.
It's fine.

10:32.608 --> 10:34.409
Is he okay?

10:38.680 --> 10:39.983
Oh, my God.

10:40.048 --> 10:41.717
Oh!

10:41.783 --> 10:44.019
- We're gonna be okay.
- Yes, yes, yes.

10:44.086 --> 10:46.154
I just... I gotta find Ruth.

10:46.221 --> 10:47.155
Baby, I'm right here,
I'm right here.

10:47.222 --> 10:48.857
I gotta find her.

10:48.925 --> 10:52.127
- I'm right here, come on.
- I just... I just gotta find...

10:52.194 --> 10:54.229
I can't find...

10:54.296 --> 10:58.200
Come on. Look, baby.
We made it to the beach.

10:58.267 --> 11:01.169
Yeah. I can't find...

11:02.738 --> 11:04.273
Is there anyone else?

11:04.339 --> 11:06.675
Um... I don't know.

11:06.742 --> 11:08.644
Um...

11:08.710 --> 11:12.748
I saw a survivor but...
they didn't make it.

11:12.814 --> 11:16.752
But we should patrol
the beach for others.

11:16.818 --> 11:18.320
What we can do is
we'll find some sticks

11:18.387 --> 11:20.489
and we'll make a signal fire.

11:20.556 --> 11:23.592
And we can find some rocks and
we'll make a visible message.

11:23.659 --> 11:25.028
Remember, it'll be
just like our expedition

11:25.093 --> 11:26.029
off the coast of Nova Scotia.

11:26.128 --> 11:27.329
That's right.

11:27.396 --> 11:29.364
We were stranded in
the dead of winter

11:29.431 --> 11:30.699
and we were surrounded by ice.

11:30.766 --> 11:32.100
And we made it out okay.

11:32.167 --> 11:34.369
But we're in
the middle of the ocean.

11:34.436 --> 11:37.306
The closest civilization is...
God knows how far!

11:37.372 --> 11:39.575
It's okay.
We're marine biologists.

11:39.641 --> 11:41.643
We spend most of our
lives on the ocean.

11:41.710 --> 11:43.679
Our chances of
survival are good.

11:43.745 --> 11:47.182
Based on our flight trajectory,
that puts us somewhere around...

11:47.249 --> 11:48.684
The Devil's Triangle.

11:48.750 --> 11:49.919
That's not good.

11:49.986 --> 11:51.486
Also known
as the Bermuda Triangle.

11:51.553 --> 11:53.088
Oh, that's not good.

11:53.155 --> 11:54.623
It's okay.
It's just a myth.

11:54.690 --> 11:57.292
It's okay.
We're in the Sargasso Sea.

11:57.359 --> 11:58.928
Sargasso Sea?

11:58.995 --> 12:01.530
It's roughly between Bermuda
and the Floridian Coast.

12:01.597 --> 12:03.498
It's a well-studied
and traveled route.

12:03.565 --> 12:07.469
Yeah. Signaling a passing ship
is gonna be our best bet.

12:08.804 --> 12:10.272
I don't see anybody.

12:10.339 --> 12:12.909
It's early in the day,
so just...

12:12.976 --> 12:15.210
Ah!

12:15.277 --> 12:17.346
- Where are we?
- Relax, relax.

12:17.412 --> 12:18.982
- Where are we?
- We're friends, relax!

12:19.048 --> 12:21.783
- Who are you?
- We're friends! We're friends!

12:21.850 --> 12:23.086
He's still in shock!

12:23.151 --> 12:25.754
- Oh, my God!
- Probably still in shock.

12:25.821 --> 12:28.992
Oh, no!
Oh, no!

12:29.058 --> 12:31.060
Come here, come here.

12:31.126 --> 12:32.561
You two, stay with him!

12:32.628 --> 12:33.930
I'm gonna go search
the beach for survivors!

12:33.997 --> 12:35.397
No, Vera!
Not in your condition!

12:35.464 --> 12:37.100
I'm fine, I'm fine!
It's okay.

12:37.165 --> 12:38.968
- They need you more than I do!
- No!

12:39.035 --> 12:40.569
I don't want you going out and
putting yourself in harm's...

12:40.636 --> 12:42.638
I don't need your
help right now, okay?

12:42.704 --> 12:45.474
Trust me!
I will be right back.

12:45.540 --> 12:47.776
30 minutes, okay?
30 minutes!

12:47.843 --> 12:49.344
If you're not back
in 30 minutes,

12:49.411 --> 12:51.014
I'm coming to look for you.
Deal?

12:51.080 --> 12:54.316
Okay. I will check the shoreline
and I will check the rocks.

12:54.383 --> 12:57.719
And I will be back
in 30 minutes, okay?

12:57.786 --> 12:59.521
Okay, and if you guys
feel up to it,

12:59.588 --> 13:01.857
look for some fresh water
and food, okay?

13:01.924 --> 13:02.925
I'll be right back.

13:26.648 --> 13:27.582
Oh, my God.

13:49.838 --> 13:51.908
- Are you okay?
- Midge! Justin!

13:51.974 --> 13:54.409
- Hey, hey.
- Who are you? Who are you?

13:54.476 --> 13:55.711
- You're safe.
- Where are we?

13:55.777 --> 13:56.778
You're safe.

13:56.845 --> 13:59.548
- The plane!
- It crashed, it crashed.

13:59.614 --> 14:01.450
The Triangle,
but it's bad luck!

14:01.516 --> 14:03.920
We're on an island
in the Sargasso Sea.

14:03.986 --> 14:05.387
What?

14:05.454 --> 14:06.889
The captain and I,

14:06.956 --> 14:09.125
we saw it on navigation,
the Devil's Triangle.

14:09.192 --> 14:11.460
It's really important
that you tell me if you

14:11.526 --> 14:14.262
or the captain sent
out any sort of signal,

14:14.329 --> 14:16.364
- some sort of distress signal.
- No.

14:16.431 --> 14:18.633
- Does anybody know we're here?
- No.

14:18.700 --> 14:20.136
No, no, no.
We tried, but we couldn't

14:20.203 --> 14:21.470
before the missiles hit us.

14:21.536 --> 14:25.340
Yeah, we saw them
from our window, too.

14:25.407 --> 14:28.610
I guess someone really doesn't
want us flying over their ocean.

14:31.680 --> 14:33.782
Hey, you're gonna
need medical attention.

14:33.849 --> 14:35.283
I know, I know.

14:35.350 --> 14:37.486
What's your name?

14:37.552 --> 14:39.454
- I'm Vera.
- I'm Sam.

14:39.521 --> 14:40.655
Here. Come on.

14:40.722 --> 14:42.457
It'll be safer with the others.

14:42.524 --> 14:44.093
- Okay?
- The others?

14:44.160 --> 14:46.095
Is there a blonde woman,
a woman with short blonde hair?

14:46.162 --> 14:47.496
And she's about 5'5.

14:47.562 --> 14:49.098
She would have been with
my brother, Justin.

14:49.165 --> 14:50.332
He's wearing a black shirt.

14:50.398 --> 14:51.500
I'm sorry.

14:52.634 --> 14:54.003
Yeah.

14:55.071 --> 14:56.772
Okay, come on.

15:00.243 --> 15:01.777
Oh, my God!
Watch out!

15:01.843 --> 15:04.881
- Go! Save yourselves!
- Hey, who are you?

15:04.947 --> 15:07.315
Get away from this island!
You made a mistake!

15:08.784 --> 15:10.219
Run! Run! Run!

15:10.285 --> 15:11.988
Oh! Oh! Oh!

15:12.054 --> 15:13.488
Vera!

15:15.992 --> 15:18.161
No!

15:18.227 --> 15:19.427
Ah!

15:19.494 --> 15:21.030
You trespass over
our sacred land!

15:21.097 --> 15:23.799
No, please!
This is just a misunderstanding!

15:27.869 --> 15:30.806
Ah!

15:30.872 --> 15:32.208
No! No!

15:32.275 --> 15:33.575
Silence!

15:35.844 --> 15:38.014
Oh, my God!

15:38.080 --> 15:39.548
By order of the King,

15:39.614 --> 15:42.551
your punishment for fleeing
is death by Hydra.

15:42.617 --> 15:44.153
Please, I will no longer flee.

15:44.220 --> 15:47.089
Please, please don't expose me
to the Hydra!

15:47.156 --> 15:48.456
I'm a good worker!

15:48.523 --> 15:49.558
I'm sorry to the King...

15:49.624 --> 15:51.760
You risked exposing our world!

15:51.827 --> 15:54.096
No! I'm sorry to the King
and my people.

15:54.163 --> 15:55.831
Please! Please!

15:55.898 --> 15:56.899
Get her up!

15:56.966 --> 15:59.035
No! No!

15:59.101 --> 16:02.271
No! No! No!

16:02.337 --> 16:04.406
Stop!
What are you doing to her?

16:14.416 --> 16:16.418
Oh, God!

16:16.484 --> 16:18.386
You offend our gods and
pollute our shores!

16:18.453 --> 16:20.555
We'd happily leave your land,
but we don't know how.

16:20.622 --> 16:22.657
You shot us down!
It's you!

16:24.160 --> 16:25.360
She needs medical attention!

16:25.427 --> 16:26.795
Please!

16:26.862 --> 16:29.065
Achilles.
Take this one back to command.

16:29.131 --> 16:30.933
Take this one prisoner.

16:56.691 --> 17:00.263
Cadmus, join me on the bridge.

17:00.329 --> 17:02.631
We have new orders
from the palace.

17:02.697 --> 17:05.667
Achilles, take the new prisoners

17:05.734 --> 17:07.869
to the medical bay
until arrival.

17:07.937 --> 17:11.406
The God King will want them
presentable before trial.

17:11.473 --> 17:14.476
What? A God King,
what is that?

17:14.542 --> 17:15.810
Move.

17:19.282 --> 17:20.883
Vera!

17:20.950 --> 17:22.784
Oh, my God,
what happened to her?

17:22.851 --> 17:24.353
Hey!
What'd you do to my wife?

17:24.419 --> 17:26.389
Quiet!

17:26.454 --> 17:28.024
Oh, what is that?

17:28.090 --> 17:29.491
Silence.

17:30.927 --> 17:31.894
No, no.

17:34.629 --> 17:37.666
You'll be okay.

17:40.002 --> 17:42.104
And what is this?
Why is he in here?

17:43.538 --> 17:45.573
He's in the healing capsule.

17:45.640 --> 17:48.210
His wounds are much worse
than yours.

17:48.277 --> 17:49.711
He'll be okay.

17:51.981 --> 17:55.151
It's an
Synechocochus Elongotus.

17:55.217 --> 17:57.053
What?
What is it?

17:57.119 --> 17:59.422
Blue-green algae.

17:59.487 --> 18:00.789
It's not typically blue-green.

18:00.855 --> 18:04.826
It's usually a dark green...

18:04.894 --> 18:08.064
Maybe it's a hybrid
with some sort of toxin.

18:08.130 --> 18:11.067
You need to get it off me.
It's making me...

18:13.069 --> 18:16.105
It's a natural anesthetic,
a pain killer.

18:16.172 --> 18:19.641
But it'll... it'll make us
very... very drowsy.

18:26.282 --> 18:29.018
Ruth? Ruth?

18:29.085 --> 18:32.388
I'm not...
I'm not gonna let them kill us!

18:32.455 --> 18:34.556
Just... Please...

18:35.958 --> 18:38.060
Let us go!

18:38.127 --> 18:40.695
Please... Please...

18:44.133 --> 18:45.134
Let us go.

18:59.181 --> 19:01.250
Pseudoliparis Swirei?

19:01.317 --> 19:03.019
Hey, you're awake.

19:04.552 --> 19:08.891
Those are rare snailfish only
found at depths of 26,000 feet.

19:08.958 --> 19:10.393
So what?

19:10.459 --> 19:13.496
That puts us like
5,000 feet shy

19:13.595 --> 19:15.931
of the depth of
the Marianas Trench

19:15.998 --> 19:20.568
in what appears to be
a World War II era sub.

19:22.171 --> 19:23.172
Where are they taking us?

19:25.107 --> 19:26.875
I don't know.

19:26.942 --> 19:29.611
But for some reason, they want
to keep us alive, apparently.

19:30.946 --> 19:34.549
Hey, I was so worried about you.

19:34.616 --> 19:37.685
You lost so much blood,
I thought I was gonna lose you.

19:38.553 --> 19:41.723
Honestly, I feel fine.

19:41.790 --> 19:44.093
I feel completely healed.

19:45.461 --> 19:46.828
Yeah, me too.

19:48.663 --> 19:50.865
I've never seen
anything like this.

19:50.933 --> 19:52.834
The healing properties
alone go against

19:52.902 --> 19:55.637
any existing science we know.

19:55.703 --> 19:58.507
Yeah, but why?

19:58.573 --> 20:00.342
Why do they want
to keep us alive?

20:00.409 --> 20:01.310
I don't know.

20:03.312 --> 20:05.147
No, no!

20:06.681 --> 20:08.150
Where are you?

20:08.217 --> 20:10.920
What happened to her?

20:10.986 --> 20:13.956
She had a brother
and sister on the flight

20:14.023 --> 20:16.025
and I don't think they made it.

20:18.994 --> 20:20.162
Where are we?
Where are we?

20:20.229 --> 20:21.796
Relax.

20:21.863 --> 20:26.402
We don't know exactly, but we're
on a submarine deep under water.

20:26.469 --> 20:28.571
Prisoners must remain silent!

20:28.636 --> 20:30.206
Where are you taking us?

20:30.272 --> 20:32.174
You will soon see:

20:32.241 --> 20:36.611
a place as majestic
and beautiful as Olympus.

20:37.480 --> 20:38.881
And that place would be?

20:40.382 --> 20:41.649
Atlantis.

20:50.326 --> 20:52.727
Del?

20:52.794 --> 20:54.662
Yeah, I'm seeing it.

21:29.797 --> 21:32.767
Please.
Please, I'll do anything.

21:32.834 --> 21:34.637
Please, just let us go.

21:34.702 --> 21:35.905
- Hey!
- Keep quiet!

21:35.971 --> 21:37.139
Attacking innocent civilians?

21:37.206 --> 21:38.673
Is that the kind
of people you are?

21:38.740 --> 21:39.909
- Vera, don't!
- Oh!

21:39.975 --> 21:41.510
- Hey! Leave her alone!
- Move!

21:41.577 --> 21:43.913
Or the next hit of my spear
will be across your brow!

21:43.979 --> 21:48.083
Punishment is swift and
cruel for the uncivilized.

21:48.150 --> 21:49.851
Now move!

21:54.689 --> 21:56.158
This one's good.

22:02.164 --> 22:03.332
Go.

22:04.799 --> 22:06.001
Go.

22:07.303 --> 22:08.803
Go.

22:13.808 --> 22:14.742
You look familiar.

22:14.809 --> 22:16.345
Keep moving!

22:16.412 --> 22:17.745
And you would be correct.

23:10.099 --> 23:11.799
Bring the outsiders forward.

23:17.406 --> 23:21.210
The God King and his household
thank you for your service.

23:24.747 --> 23:26.015
We do not take
kindly to intruders

23:26.081 --> 23:28.751
in the Atlantean territory.

23:28.816 --> 23:31.320
You shall not dare turn your
backs upon His Highness

23:31.387 --> 23:33.956
at any time for it's
an affront to the gods.

23:34.023 --> 23:36.191
And, therefore,
an affront to our King.

23:36.258 --> 23:38.060
You will be fed to the Hydra
in the grand harbor

23:38.127 --> 23:40.562
where he sleeps
beneath our tower of light,

23:40.629 --> 23:43.365
as is our custom.

23:43.432 --> 23:45.734
And what if we don't
give a damn about your custom?

23:45.800 --> 23:47.503
Silence!

23:49.938 --> 23:52.241
Know your place
in a house of royalty.

23:54.343 --> 23:56.111
Mainlanders...

23:56.178 --> 23:59.248
you stand accused of
crimes against the deep.

24:01.116 --> 24:03.085
Such vile offenses include:

24:03.152 --> 24:07.256
trespassing, destruction of
precious resources and property,

24:07.323 --> 24:09.058
resisting arrest

24:09.124 --> 24:12.294
and, worst of all,
an attempt to harm

24:12.361 --> 24:16.298
the only one of its kind:
the Hydra.

24:16.365 --> 24:20.035
You now stand in the presence
of Nereus the Second,

24:20.102 --> 24:23.672
descendant of Poseidon,
Commander of the Seven Seas,

24:23.739 --> 24:26.442
the God King of Atlantis!

24:36.318 --> 24:38.987
You people look most changed
since the last time

24:39.054 --> 24:42.291
your kind has come this way.

24:44.360 --> 24:48.464
More...
discomposed and haggard.

24:51.600 --> 24:55.237
Well, be you so uneducated

24:55.304 --> 24:58.640
that summoning
a response is strenuous?

24:58.707 --> 25:00.542
Speak, I say.

25:04.580 --> 25:07.349
I guess we will cut
to the heart of the matter.

25:09.284 --> 25:11.520
How do you all plead
for your crimes?

25:15.324 --> 25:16.425
Speak!

25:16.492 --> 25:18.761
Not guilty!
We're not guilty!

25:18.827 --> 25:21.130
We were not intending to...

25:21.196 --> 25:23.966
You will address his highness
as "My Lord", "My King",

25:24.032 --> 25:26.135
"Your Eminence",
or "Lord Supreme".

25:26.201 --> 25:28.637
Unless, you wish
to be fed to the Hydra.

25:29.938 --> 25:32.141
Okay.

25:32.207 --> 25:34.543
Yes, My...
My King.

25:36.845 --> 25:40.048
So you plead not guilty.

25:41.784 --> 25:43.452
I'm curious.

25:43.519 --> 25:46.054
Who do you think should bear
the brunt of the responsibility

25:46.121 --> 25:48.257
of the crimes at your feet?

25:48.323 --> 25:50.859
I do.

25:50.926 --> 25:52.027
It's my fault.

25:52.094 --> 25:53.562
Sam, what are you doing?

25:53.629 --> 25:55.130
You're gonna
get yourself killed.

25:55.197 --> 25:57.566
Our airplane was attacked
in the night.

25:57.633 --> 26:00.169
I assume one of your people
had a hand in it.

26:00.235 --> 26:02.805
We protect our people
and our lands

26:02.871 --> 26:07.042
from vile humans as we see fit.

26:07.109 --> 26:08.644
I'm a pilot.

26:08.710 --> 26:11.447
It's my fault our plane
crashed into your land.

26:11.513 --> 26:14.082
That is not true!
Your missiles hit our plane!

26:14.149 --> 26:15.717
Dozens are dead because of you!

26:15.784 --> 26:17.219
You are the guilty one!

26:17.286 --> 26:18.253
Silence!

26:21.423 --> 26:22.858
Proceed.

26:22.926 --> 26:26.428
I implore you to see our side
and take mercy on us.

26:26.495 --> 26:29.398
We don't mean you
or your people any harm.

26:29.465 --> 26:31.033
Spare my friends.

26:31.099 --> 26:33.869
Send them back to
the mainland safely.

26:33.937 --> 26:36.972
Take me, punish me.

26:37.039 --> 26:38.440
I have nothing else to lose.

26:40.242 --> 26:43.245
You say you're a pilot.

26:43.312 --> 26:45.047
Yes.

26:45.113 --> 26:48.150
Former military for
the American forces.

26:48.217 --> 26:51.153
And you can command
all kinds of craft, yes?

26:51.220 --> 26:53.388
Yes, a wide range.

26:59.896 --> 27:03.432
Oh, my friends, my friends!

27:03.499 --> 27:06.435
Please forgive a king
his theatrics.

27:06.502 --> 27:09.304
It's so rare that
we have people

27:09.371 --> 27:12.241
who do not wish ill will
to my fine city.

27:13.842 --> 27:17.079
Erastos, remove
these shackles at once!

27:18.647 --> 27:21.049
Sire, I must advise
against this.

27:22.886 --> 27:25.187
Must I repeat myself?

27:25.254 --> 27:27.189
These are not our prisoners.

27:27.256 --> 27:29.157
They are our guests.

27:31.126 --> 27:33.495
Move.

27:33.562 --> 27:35.430
Cadmus?

27:43.272 --> 27:45.140
How fortunate it is
that you found us

27:45.207 --> 27:47.576
in such dire circumstances.

27:47.643 --> 27:51.613
I hope my scouts have not
rattled you beyond repair.

27:51.680 --> 27:54.750
Nothing beyond
a few bruised egos.

27:54.816 --> 27:57.486
And humorous, too!

27:57.553 --> 28:01.256
We will make
a court jester of you yet.

28:01.323 --> 28:04.059
And what manner of
personage are you two?

28:04.126 --> 28:06.996
Oh... um... uh...

28:07.062 --> 28:10.132
This is Ruth, my wife.

28:10.198 --> 28:13.036
- Hi.
- And I'm Owen... Owen Dubois.

28:13.101 --> 28:14.636
It's French.

28:14.703 --> 28:17.040
They are fools.

28:17.105 --> 28:19.875
Please, forgive my advisor.

28:19.943 --> 28:23.312
He has the biting wit of an eel.

28:23.378 --> 28:25.581
Wait.

28:25.647 --> 28:27.482
Forgive me for the question,
Your Highness.

28:27.549 --> 28:30.419
But how do you
all speak English?

28:30.485 --> 28:31.955
If the rumors are true,

28:32.021 --> 28:34.456
it's been a millennia
since Atlantis sank.

28:34.523 --> 28:38.427
You should all be speaking
some sort of Phoenician.

28:38.493 --> 28:42.464
Well, you are not the first
of your kind to pass this way.

28:42.531 --> 28:46.435
We have collected many things
over the past century

28:46.501 --> 28:49.571
to better understand
a potential enemy.

28:49.638 --> 28:52.140
I thought you just
called us your friends.

28:52.207 --> 28:54.276
You're right.

28:54.343 --> 28:56.211
You are not our enemies.

28:56.278 --> 28:59.114
Now, come!
You must be weary.

28:59.181 --> 29:01.183
We will make bedchambers
for your stay.

29:01.249 --> 29:02.851
No, no, no.
We can't stay.

29:02.919 --> 29:05.821
We need to get back to
the mainland immediately.

29:05.888 --> 29:07.356
Nonsense!

29:07.422 --> 29:09.858
No one turns down an
invitation from the King.

29:09.926 --> 29:13.795
Guards, please show our
guests to their chambers.

29:25.942 --> 29:28.377
Well, when in Atlantis.

29:29.778 --> 29:34.282
Atlantis. Who would have thought
the legends are true?

29:34.349 --> 29:35.484
Hey, could you...

29:35.550 --> 29:37.285
- Yeah. I got you.
- Thanks.

29:39.154 --> 29:41.390
Yeah.

29:41.456 --> 29:45.360
I don't know. Something just
still feels off about it.

29:45.427 --> 29:47.696
Look, the King
won't let us leave.

29:50.666 --> 29:52.834
I know, but we need
to make them feel at ease

29:52.902 --> 29:55.771
with us if we want
to keep those chains off us.

29:55.837 --> 29:58.041
If we want to survive here,
we've got to...

29:58.107 --> 29:59.474
We got to play nice.

30:00.742 --> 30:02.011
Exactly.

30:02.078 --> 30:03.913
Big smiles, best behavior.

30:07.315 --> 30:09.952
And in the meantime,
we make a plan to escape.

30:10.019 --> 30:12.821
We're gonna need weapons
to get past the guards.

30:12.889 --> 30:15.058
And we're gonna need a craft
to get to the surface.

30:15.124 --> 30:16.558
I saw one in the harbor,

30:16.625 --> 30:19.095
but I have no idea
how we're gonna get it

30:19.162 --> 30:20.862
with the Hydra guarding it.

30:22.999 --> 30:26.702
So let's gather some intel
and we'll make a plan tonight.

30:26.768 --> 30:28.971
And I want to talk to that
vendor from the market.

30:29.038 --> 30:30.372
He looked so familiar.

30:30.439 --> 30:32.340
Yeah. I was gonna
say the same thing.

30:32.407 --> 30:34.476
It's like...

30:34.543 --> 30:38.680
I recognize his face
from books or articles

30:38.747 --> 30:42.284
or like really old photographs,
like black and white ones.

30:42.350 --> 30:43.719
Same.

30:43.785 --> 30:45.253
Let's see
if we can find him later.

30:45.320 --> 30:47.322
Deal.

30:49.591 --> 30:53.695
Hey, and I know
we've been fighting lately.

30:53.762 --> 30:56.165
And I know we haven't been
working well together.

30:56.231 --> 30:59.634
But we need
to work together now.

30:59.701 --> 31:00.635
You with me?

31:02.437 --> 31:04.706
I'm with you 100%.

31:05.975 --> 31:07.609
We're gonna
get outta here together.

31:11.180 --> 31:13.983
Okay.

31:14.050 --> 31:14.984
You ready?

31:16.451 --> 31:18.720
I'm ready.

31:18.787 --> 31:19.755
Let's go.

31:30.166 --> 31:31.767
Midge, are you okay?

31:31.833 --> 31:33.435
Yeah.

31:33.502 --> 31:34.870
Oh, where are we?

31:36.271 --> 31:39.041
Midge, I think we're
the only ones that survived.

31:39.108 --> 31:41.309
I know.

31:41.376 --> 31:45.248
Sam!
I can't believe she's gone!

31:45.313 --> 31:47.783
She really tried, Midge.

31:47.849 --> 31:50.619
God, I'm never flying again.

31:50.685 --> 31:52.487
I'll never be
in a cockpit again.

31:54.891 --> 31:56.358
Okay. All right.

31:56.424 --> 31:59.828
We have to figure out where we
are so we can get outta here.

31:59.896 --> 32:01.863
Well, it looks
like there's footsteps.

32:01.931 --> 32:04.533
So maybe someone's
been here before?

32:04.599 --> 32:07.803
Okay.
All right, let's follow it.

32:07.869 --> 32:08.971
Come on.

32:13.675 --> 32:14.876
Get down, get down, get down!

32:20.082 --> 32:22.084
She looks military.
Maybe she'll help us.

32:25.754 --> 32:27.957
I do not want to deal with her.

32:29.324 --> 32:31.060
Should we go around?

32:31.127 --> 32:32.494
Yeah.

32:32.561 --> 32:34.163
- Don't let her see you.
- Okay.

32:34.230 --> 32:35.697
- Stay low.
- All right.

32:35.764 --> 32:36.966
Keep down.

32:40.102 --> 32:42.838
One more step and
I'll slice your throats.

32:43.906 --> 32:45.041
Who are you?

32:45.107 --> 32:47.876
That is none of your
concern, mainlander!

32:47.944 --> 32:51.346
Look, please,
our plane crashed and...

32:51.413 --> 32:52.882
Silence!

32:52.949 --> 32:55.383
Do you not think
we already know this?

32:55.450 --> 32:57.485
Who do you think
shot your plane down?

32:58.587 --> 33:01.523
Why?
What did we ever do to you?

33:01.590 --> 33:03.226
Your people.

33:03.292 --> 33:06.728
You pollute our lands,
you destroy our oceans!

33:08.396 --> 33:10.565
We will rise again.

33:10.632 --> 33:14.536
Until then, our King
will be very pleased

33:14.603 --> 33:16.605
we have more survivors.

33:17.873 --> 33:19.041
Come with me!

33:26.082 --> 33:27.350
You'll die for this!

33:31.220 --> 33:32.687
Justin, what did you do?

33:32.754 --> 33:34.290
I... I don't know.

33:34.357 --> 33:35.590
Is she dead?

33:35.657 --> 33:37.326
I don't know, Midge!

33:37.392 --> 33:40.428
She's not alone! Others are
gonna come looking for her!

33:40.495 --> 33:41.898
We gotta go!
We gotta go!

33:41.964 --> 33:42.932
Okay!

33:47.636 --> 33:49.704
May I have your
attention, please?

33:49.771 --> 33:52.275
The King sends his regards,
but he will not be joining us.

33:52.341 --> 33:55.543
He's tending to an urgent
matter with Archimedes.

33:57.846 --> 33:59.514
Your city is beautiful.

33:59.581 --> 34:01.317
I'm particularly
interested in the lighting.

34:01.384 --> 34:05.288
It's powered by some form of
bioluminescent algae, correct?

34:05.354 --> 34:08.590
Well, you must be well-learned.

34:08.657 --> 34:11.193
My husband and I
have dedicated our lives

34:11.260 --> 34:12.761
to the study of the ocean.

34:12.827 --> 34:15.530
Marine biology,
as our people call it.

34:15.597 --> 34:21.370
Well, Atlanteans value the
scientific mind above all else.

34:21.436 --> 34:25.440
And we wish to
make certain that you all

34:25.507 --> 34:27.109
receive a tour
of our fine kingdom.

34:29.811 --> 34:33.382
Uh, we wish to stay here,
Your Highness.

34:33.448 --> 34:36.851
Is my hospitality
not good enough for you?

34:36.919 --> 34:38.486
No.

34:38.553 --> 34:40.990
We would just
rather wait for Sam

34:41.057 --> 34:43.658
so we may celebrate
the good fortune

34:43.725 --> 34:46.528
with the King
of Atlantis together.

34:46.594 --> 34:49.999
You're all new to the city, so
I'm only going to say this once.

34:50.066 --> 34:54.602
You would be wise not to turn
down an offer from the King.

34:56.138 --> 34:58.174
I meant no disrespect.

34:58.240 --> 35:01.344
Yeah. It would be an
honor to take a tour

35:01.410 --> 35:03.212
of your scientific facilities.

35:03.279 --> 35:06.548
And you two, our guards
have just informed us

35:06.614 --> 35:11.020
that you've both been wed.

35:11.087 --> 35:12.888
Yeah.

35:12.955 --> 35:14.656
We were on our way
to our honeymoon

35:14.723 --> 35:16.725
when our plane crashed.

35:16.791 --> 35:20.129
Well, Atlantis boasts of
many sights and secrets

35:20.196 --> 35:22.198
of the ancient world,

35:22.264 --> 35:27.203
a fine and beautiful
place for a honeymoon.

35:27.269 --> 35:28.870
The guards, of course,
will show you anywhere you wish

35:28.938 --> 35:30.505
to go within the confines
of the kingdom.

35:33.175 --> 35:34.709
Thank you.

35:34.776 --> 35:37.645
Go into the marketplace.

35:37.712 --> 35:40.449
Pick out something nice,
anything you like.

35:40.515 --> 35:44.719
The King will insist that
you have a proper wedding gift.

35:46.188 --> 35:47.522
Thank you.

35:56.865 --> 35:59.634
When we're alone,
we need to make a plan.

36:25.727 --> 36:31.067
Welcome to our very own pearl
of the deep, Atlantean Science.

36:31.133 --> 36:33.369
All of our greatest minds
have passed through

36:33.436 --> 36:37.139
these hallowed halls
at one time or another.

36:37.206 --> 36:39.975
Del, look at this.

36:40.042 --> 36:42.211
That's the beach we crashed on.

36:42.278 --> 36:44.914
This is our defense map.

36:44.980 --> 36:47.883
- Defense map?
- Yes.

36:47.950 --> 36:50.419
We've programmed a minefield
of cutting edge weaponry

36:50.486 --> 36:52.288
to safeguard our borders,

36:52.354 --> 36:55.524
but only used when
absolutely necessary.

36:55.590 --> 36:57.993
This is our chief
scientist, Archimedes,

36:58.060 --> 37:01.629
a prodigy among our
collection of great minds.

37:01.696 --> 37:04.266
I'll leave you
in her able hands.

37:04.333 --> 37:08.037
And what are these hexagons
along the cumulonimbus?

37:08.104 --> 37:09.338
Wind bombs.

37:09.405 --> 37:11.140
From this table, my team
and I have the ability

37:11.207 --> 37:13.675
to manipulate the elements
of the triangle.

37:13.741 --> 37:15.810
With the hexagons,
we pump the air full

37:15.878 --> 37:18.680
of enhanced substances
that act as ice nuclei,

37:18.746 --> 37:20.583
which help to alter
the formations of clouds

37:20.648 --> 37:22.384
from the microphysical level.

37:22.451 --> 37:24.386
So it's cloud seeding.

37:24.453 --> 37:25.454
Precisely.

37:25.521 --> 37:26.688
It forces the...

37:26.754 --> 37:28.057
Forces the flow
of precipitation.

37:28.124 --> 37:29.691
It's not my area of expertise,

37:29.757 --> 37:31.127
but I know enough about it
to know

37:31.193 --> 37:33.395
that the science is
somewhat debatable.

37:34.863 --> 37:37.600
I guess not anymore.

37:37.665 --> 37:40.302
Yes. And luckily
for my team and I,

37:40.369 --> 37:42.138
the weather in the region
does the rest of the work for us

37:42.204 --> 37:45.074
turning these altered clouds
into small hurricanes

37:45.141 --> 37:48.344
which appear as
the hexagons you see before you.

37:48.410 --> 37:50.246
<i>Over the years,
we've had to protect our city,</i>

37:50.312 --> 37:52.348
<i>keeping it hidden
from the world above.</i>

37:52.414 --> 37:55.650
<i>We exist in seclusion far
away, no threat to you at all.</i>

37:55.717 --> 37:58.853
<i>Yet even after you outsiders
failed to penetrate our world,</i>

37:58.921 --> 38:00.890
<i>you tried and tried again.</i>

38:00.956 --> 38:02.958
<i>Then finally,
the day came when your science</i>

38:03.025 --> 38:04.560
<i>could take you deep
below the surface,</i>

38:04.627 --> 38:06.962
<i>closer to us than ever before.</i>

38:07.029 --> 38:09.632
<i>It was the first time in
many years that we felt fear.</i>

38:09.697 --> 38:11.367
<i>In secret, you came.</i>

38:11.433 --> 38:14.370
<i>You sent a submarine vessel
to spy upon our city.</i>

38:14.436 --> 38:16.338
<i>Once again, our sisters
and brothers of the sea</i>

38:16.405 --> 38:18.307
<i>protected us,
ensuring that the outsiders</i>

38:18.374 --> 38:20.543
<i>would never return to tell
of what they had seen.</i>

38:20.609 --> 38:23.212
<i>Though it would end
in disaster for your kind.</i>

38:23.279 --> 38:25.548
<i>We knew Atlantis
would never be the same.</i>

38:25.614 --> 38:27.583
<i>We would now have to
learn of your science,</i>

38:27.650 --> 38:30.186
<i>learn of your means of invasion
and your means of destruction.</i>

38:30.252 --> 38:33.755
<i>And we pray that it does
not make us what you are.</i>

38:38.360 --> 38:40.663
Perhaps you'll find
this next wonder of ours

38:40.728 --> 38:43.065
a bit more interesting.
Come.

38:45.000 --> 38:46.969
This room houses the
main power source for

38:47.036 --> 38:51.006
our entire civilization,
our light and machines,

38:51.073 --> 38:54.742
the simulations of night and
day, sun, moon and stars,

38:54.809 --> 38:57.279
powered by a rare form
of ocean floor algae

38:57.346 --> 38:59.682
with which my team has
been able to communicate.

38:59.747 --> 39:01.584
Communicate?

39:01.650 --> 39:02.585
Mm-hmm.

39:02.651 --> 39:04.153
Yeah.

39:04.220 --> 39:08.357
Are you trying to tell us
that this wall is sentient?

39:08.424 --> 39:09.992
Correct.

39:10.059 --> 39:12.727
I've heard of some
biochemical reactions

39:12.794 --> 39:14.330
among undersea plant life.

39:14.396 --> 39:16.831
But nothing that resembles
an intelligible language.

39:16.899 --> 39:18.467
That is merely the beginning.

39:18.534 --> 39:21.103
They have a rich language
they speak with to one another.

39:21.170 --> 39:23.973
All we had to simply do
was learn it.

39:24.039 --> 39:25.840
They are so highly reactive.

39:25.908 --> 39:27.243
Their bioelectric communication

39:27.309 --> 39:30.012
can connect with
our neurology through touch.

39:30.079 --> 39:32.181
Isn't it beautiful?

39:32.248 --> 39:34.782
They provide us
with many resources:

39:34.849 --> 39:37.620
bioelectric energy,
bioluminescence,

39:37.686 --> 39:39.421
bioelectric weapons,

39:39.488 --> 39:40.956
as you've no doubt
experienced first-hand

39:41.023 --> 39:42.691
while here in Atlantis.

39:42.757 --> 39:45.227
Like the spears.

39:45.294 --> 39:47.263
Yes, the spears.

39:47.329 --> 39:48.931
Even the Hydra
responds to the algae.

39:48.998 --> 39:50.466
Without it, we would be
at its mercy.

39:50.532 --> 39:53.168
That is amazing.

39:53.235 --> 39:56.804
The King will be most pleased
to hear of your approval,

39:56.871 --> 39:59.141
and Archimedes is yours.

40:00.643 --> 40:03.545
Perhaps one day we may work
together to bridge our peoples

40:03.612 --> 40:06.749
through a higher understanding
and advanced drive.

40:06.814 --> 40:09.885
Maybe... one day.

40:09.952 --> 40:12.354
Yes, yes. Thank you.

40:12.421 --> 40:15.958
It's obvious that there is much
here that we don't understand.

40:16.025 --> 40:18.394
Come. There are
many more sights to see.

40:29.071 --> 40:31.507
Aren't you coming?

40:31.573 --> 40:33.208
No, not at this time.

40:33.275 --> 40:36.378
But please,
this is all for you.

40:37.780 --> 40:38.914
Proceed.

41:03.405 --> 41:06.809
Oh, now, would you look at that?

41:06.874 --> 41:09.712
I'll give you 15 American coins
for the gold necklace.

41:09.778 --> 41:11.213
Try again, my friend.

41:11.280 --> 41:14.116
Come on.
Fifteen rare coins?

41:14.183 --> 41:16.151
The necklace has gotta
be worth that.

41:16.218 --> 41:18.954
Do you think
the value of gold

41:19.021 --> 41:21.924
is worth the loss
of your backside?

41:21.990 --> 41:24.259
Fifty.

41:24.326 --> 41:25.994
Fifty?

41:29.064 --> 41:32.401
Um... just one second.

41:34.970 --> 41:38.173
I wanted to get you
a solid gold necklace.

41:38.240 --> 41:40.142
You didn't have
to use your own money.

41:40.209 --> 41:42.478
The King said he wanted
to get us a wedding gift.

41:42.544 --> 41:46.181
I just... I wanted to get you
something nice.

41:47.449 --> 41:50.052
Honey, I would love
a gold necklace.

41:50.119 --> 41:52.221
I would love to lay on
the beaches here,

41:52.287 --> 41:54.390
to dine in the gorgeous palaces,

41:54.456 --> 41:58.794
to live like... like a queen
for the rest of my life.

41:58.861 --> 42:00.295
And we can.

42:00.362 --> 42:02.598
Forget that we were
in a plane crash, right?

42:02.664 --> 42:04.099
We are friends of the King.

42:04.166 --> 42:06.668
We can live like that
for the rest of our lives

42:06.735 --> 42:08.070
if we stay here.

42:08.137 --> 42:10.806
Owen, this isn't our home.

42:10.873 --> 42:12.741
We have lives up there.

42:12.808 --> 42:15.879
And jobs... and debt?

42:15.944 --> 42:19.181
And friends and family?

42:19.248 --> 42:21.617
We need to find Del and Vera.
They know the ocean.

42:21.683 --> 42:25.187
They can help us get out of here
and maybe we can help them.

42:25.254 --> 42:27.222
Do you see what I'm saying?

42:27.289 --> 42:30.325
Yeah, you're right.

42:30.392 --> 42:34.129
As much as I don't wanna
leave this place, we have to.

42:34.196 --> 42:36.198
And finding them will help.

42:37.499 --> 42:40.536
I promise we, you and I,
will get back home.

42:45.174 --> 42:47.209
Okay. Let's go.

42:58.387 --> 43:01.323
- It's cold.
- I know.

43:03.625 --> 43:04.693
Search them.

43:06.896 --> 43:08.263
What is it?

43:08.330 --> 43:09.631
Do you hear something?

43:11.567 --> 43:13.168
No.

43:16.205 --> 43:17.439
Could have sworn
I heard something.

43:22.611 --> 43:24.279
Hello?

43:27.015 --> 43:28.952
Who's out there?

43:29.017 --> 43:30.352
Show yourselves!

43:31.487 --> 43:32.421
Look out!

43:32.488 --> 43:34.256
- Run, Justin!
- Midge!

43:34.323 --> 43:35.424
Let go of me!
Justin!

43:35.491 --> 43:37.025
Back off!
I'm warning you!

43:37.092 --> 43:38.827
Run, Justin!

43:38.895 --> 43:40.662
I'm warning you!

43:40.729 --> 43:42.231
Shh, shh.

43:44.066 --> 43:45.701
Don't move or
I will kill you.

43:47.336 --> 43:50.372
- Midge!
- Pitiful!

43:50.439 --> 43:52.508
No more threats from you,
weak mainlander!

44:00.649 --> 44:02.017
It was all my fault.

44:02.084 --> 44:03.352
I could have
done something...

44:03.418 --> 44:06.321
anything when I had the chance.

44:06.388 --> 44:10.927
I could have saved everyone,
including my brother and sister.

44:10.994 --> 44:12.394
I failed.

44:12.461 --> 44:15.397
You say your craft
spun out of control,

44:15.464 --> 44:20.135
a terrible accident caused by
our more aggressive defenses.

44:20.202 --> 44:25.073
You are not the genius
of such tragedy.

44:25.140 --> 44:27.944
And I give you my humblest
apologies for the misfortunes

44:28.011 --> 44:29.444
that we have brought upon you.

44:29.511 --> 44:31.613
No. That's okay.
It's not your fault.

44:31.680 --> 44:33.549
You were just
protecting your people,

44:33.615 --> 44:36.752
which is what I should have been
doing while I had the chance.

44:38.320 --> 44:42.090
I had hundreds of
people's lives in my hands.

44:42.157 --> 44:44.359
I failed.

44:44.426 --> 44:45.661
The worst part is,
is I don't even know

44:45.727 --> 44:48.397
what happened
to Midge and Justin.

44:48.463 --> 44:49.631
Who?

44:49.698 --> 44:50.699
My family.

44:52.401 --> 44:55.270
Ah, you seek closure,

44:55.337 --> 44:58.340
as do we all after
a brush with Hades.

45:01.476 --> 45:04.580
You know, I used to think
about settling down someday,

45:04.646 --> 45:09.151
raising a family, growing old
somewhere green and beautiful.

45:09.217 --> 45:10.686
But I don't know,
I guess after serving

45:10.752 --> 45:13.355
in the military so long,
something changed.

45:13.422 --> 45:18.460
Seeing all that violence,
war, hate,

45:18.527 --> 45:20.362
I mean, what kind
of person would I be

45:20.429 --> 45:23.799
to raise children in
a world like this, you know?

45:23.865 --> 45:27.869
That's when I became completely
dependent on my siblings.

45:29.838 --> 45:31.573
They mean everything to me.

45:34.911 --> 45:36.278
Sorry.

45:36.345 --> 45:38.480
I don't know why
I'm unloading on you.

45:38.547 --> 45:41.951
What does a king care about
the misfortunes of a pilot?

45:42.018 --> 45:45.520
On the contrary, as King,

45:45.587 --> 45:49.157
it's my sacred duty to safeguard
the happiness of all my people.

45:51.760 --> 45:54.196
I may not be able to bring
the dead back to life.

45:54.262 --> 45:58.433
But perhaps I can give you
something to lift your spirits.

45:58.500 --> 46:00.335
Come with me.
I want to show you something.

46:09.244 --> 46:10.646
Look at that!

46:10.712 --> 46:12.447
An impressive sight,
is it not?

46:12.514 --> 46:14.416
Yeah, you could say that.

46:15.517 --> 46:19.388
I suspect that this
would be a gift best suitable

46:19.454 --> 46:23.291
for someone like you,
a military woman.

46:23.358 --> 46:25.962
You say you can command
all kinds of craft, yes?

46:26.029 --> 46:27.562
Well, yeah.

46:27.629 --> 46:29.564
I mean, I have friends in
all branches of the military.

46:29.631 --> 46:31.433
And they certainly
taught me things.

46:31.500 --> 46:33.602
But I'm only trained
to fly planes.

46:33.669 --> 46:37.073
Well, we have collected it all,

46:37.140 --> 46:39.241
the jewels of
a lost world

46:39.307 --> 46:42.244
repurposed for
an Atlantean fleet.

46:55.390 --> 46:58.326
I can see why this place
is a paradise.

46:58.393 --> 47:01.097
It's beautiful.

47:01.164 --> 47:04.399
Yes, a paradise,
far from your troubles

47:04.466 --> 47:08.203
and experiences
from the mainland.

47:08.270 --> 47:10.439
But as all
things that have life,

47:10.505 --> 47:12.808
this great paradise
has an expiration date.

47:14.077 --> 47:15.277
What do you mean?

47:15.343 --> 47:18.014
Atlantis is dying, Samantha.

47:18.081 --> 47:19.614
It's already begun.

47:19.681 --> 47:22.085
We are but 1%
of what we used to be.

47:22.151 --> 47:25.287
I don't understand.

47:25.353 --> 47:27.756
I did not want to trouble you
or your friends.

47:27.823 --> 47:31.060
But as the oceans
are beginning to be crippled

47:31.127 --> 47:34.396
more and more each day
and Mother Earth being drained

47:34.463 --> 47:36.933
of her natural resources,

47:36.999 --> 47:40.103
our brightest minds have already
predicted an imminent doomsday.

47:40.169 --> 47:43.106
Doomsday?
From climate change?

47:43.172 --> 47:47.110
I'm afraid this way of life
that my family has safeguarded

47:47.176 --> 47:52.848
for so many centuries is on the
verge of collapse, Samantha.

47:52.915 --> 47:55.517
The ocean is
a delicate ecosystem,

47:55.584 --> 47:57.719
something that your
mainland destruction

47:57.786 --> 48:01.057
is quickly tipping
into murkier waters.

48:01.124 --> 48:07.029
After the oceans fall,
thereafter so will Atlantis.

48:07.096 --> 48:12.601
And your surface world will not
survive much longer after that.

48:12.667 --> 48:16.304
As the air is heated,
so is the ocean.

48:16.371 --> 48:18.941
The great shift will
stop the currents.

48:19.008 --> 48:22.011
The marine life will perish.

48:22.078 --> 48:25.313
Ecosystems on land
that are connected to the ocean

48:25.380 --> 48:29.218
will collapse and
your cities will flood.

48:29.284 --> 48:30.852
No!

48:30.920 --> 48:32.621
Our governments have been making
this fight a top priority.

48:32.687 --> 48:34.790
Climate change
affects all of us.

48:34.856 --> 48:37.692
We have hosted
a handful of humans

48:37.759 --> 48:41.363
in the past, Samantha,
in secret.

48:41.429 --> 48:43.331
They do not listen.

48:43.398 --> 48:45.234
Your governments
are lying to you.

48:45.300 --> 48:46.936
No.

48:47.003 --> 48:48.770
Or simply they do not
understand

48:48.837 --> 48:50.639
the destruction
they are causing.

48:50.705 --> 48:52.942
No, you're wrong!
You have to be wrong!

48:53.009 --> 48:54.709
There's got to be
something we can do!

48:54.776 --> 48:56.511
Maybe your tech
can do something,

48:56.578 --> 48:58.380
something to stop this or I can!

48:58.446 --> 49:00.016
I'll do anything I can to help!

49:09.992 --> 49:11.660
We have to record this,
all of it.

49:11.726 --> 49:14.429
Any information we find
could help us escape.

49:14.496 --> 49:17.300
Turn the flash off!

49:17.365 --> 49:19.734
My phone!

49:19.801 --> 49:23.005
That vile thing blinded me,
you mainland scum!

49:23.072 --> 49:24.539
Get away from me.

49:24.606 --> 49:27.642
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
cool down, all right?

49:27.709 --> 49:29.178
I know you're a black belt
in Hapkido

49:29.245 --> 49:30.679
and can kick ass now that
you're finally healed.

49:30.745 --> 49:34.516
But we have to keep
a low profile.

49:34.583 --> 49:36.585
I'm just get the phone, okay?

49:36.651 --> 49:42.124
I'm just gonna get the phone.
I'm just gonna get the phone.

49:45.294 --> 49:46.996
Just getting the phone.

49:48.864 --> 49:53.903
All right, stand down,
stand down, stand down.

49:56.939 --> 50:01.376
I'm sure the mainlanders
meant no harm.

50:03.445 --> 50:05.948
I think we
all can agree

50:06.015 --> 50:08.617
we don't need
any broken bones today.

50:10.852 --> 50:12.021
Thank you.

50:19.728 --> 50:23.698
We have to maintain
ourselves on this island,

50:23.765 --> 50:26.102
not at the cost
of our dignity!

50:26.168 --> 50:27.336
You understand that?

50:27.402 --> 50:28.337
Yes, sir.
Of course.

50:28.403 --> 50:29.972
- You?
- Yes.

50:30.039 --> 50:31.274
Thank you.

50:31.340 --> 50:32.407
I'm Ruth.

50:32.474 --> 50:35.278
I am called Pluto.

50:35.344 --> 50:36.745
That's right!

50:36.811 --> 50:38.813
We were talking
earlier about the necklaces.

50:38.881 --> 50:43.618
You said your name
is, um, Pluto?

50:43.685 --> 50:47.056
I just said it.
You didn't hear me?

50:47.123 --> 50:48.757
No, I got it.

50:48.823 --> 50:54.030
I am named after the gods who
released the Hounds of Hell.

50:57.199 --> 51:02.138
So you understand you have
to maintain dignity here.

51:04.206 --> 51:05.440
Go.

51:05.507 --> 51:06.541
Yes, sir.

51:06.608 --> 51:09.178
Thank you, Pluto, thank you.

51:15.217 --> 51:18.387
Hey, that guy back there,
I know this sounds crazy.

51:18.453 --> 51:23.159
But I think he's a famous
admiral from World War II.

51:23.225 --> 51:26.262
What?
What are you talking about?

51:26.329 --> 51:27.897
Listen to me.

51:27.964 --> 51:29.932
So my grandfather, he used
to tell me all these stories

51:29.999 --> 51:32.567
of his time in the
military and show me photos.

51:32.634 --> 51:35.737
And that guy
was in the pictures.

51:35.804 --> 51:39.442
I just...
I just can't remember his name.

51:39.507 --> 51:42.610
Well, he said
his name was Pluto.

51:42.677 --> 51:45.047
I heard him, but, look,

51:45.114 --> 51:47.049
I don't think he's an Atlantean.

51:47.116 --> 51:50.052
Didn't you hear the way
he talked to those guards?

51:50.119 --> 51:53.956
Okay. Well, what?
You wanna go talk to him?

51:54.023 --> 51:55.424
No, no.

51:55.490 --> 51:58.626
Let's get the others
and then we'll come back.

51:58.693 --> 52:02.231
Well, wait.
Why don't we get the necklace?

52:05.401 --> 52:06.601
You're so bad!

52:10.505 --> 52:12.908
Dropped my phone again.

52:12.975 --> 52:14.542
Damn it! The screen is
completely cracked.

52:14.609 --> 52:16.012
Owen, look at this.

52:22.284 --> 52:23.685
Owen?

52:30.159 --> 52:31.160
What are you doing?

52:31.227 --> 52:32.228
Shh! Keep your voice down.

52:33.728 --> 52:37.799
My forces are willing and
ready to assist you

52:37.866 --> 52:40.769
in all the things you may
need to undertake this mission.

52:40.835 --> 52:42.905
What's the King doing with Sam?

52:42.972 --> 52:45.774
Wait.
Let me get this straight.

52:45.840 --> 52:48.077
You want me to captain
one of those,

52:48.144 --> 52:51.613
your updated
World War II Allied sub?

52:51.679 --> 52:55.418
And deliver our best chances
of survival, yes.

52:55.484 --> 52:58.888
I would not ask you this if
it was not absolutely critical.

52:58.954 --> 53:02.958
This has the potential
of saving all mankind

53:03.025 --> 53:05.194
and saving
the planet, Samantha.

53:05.261 --> 53:07.829
Well, why not ask one of
your own commanders to do it?

53:07.897 --> 53:09.331
Why do you need me?

53:09.398 --> 53:11.800
I believe you can agree
that your governments

53:11.866 --> 53:13.701
are a little hostile
to outsiders.

53:13.768 --> 53:15.371
Once they see us coming,

53:15.438 --> 53:17.705
they're naturally going
to feel we are invaders.

53:17.772 --> 53:20.309
And they're gonna
blow us from the water.

53:20.376 --> 53:24.480
This responsibility is best
suited for one of their own.

53:24.547 --> 53:29.251
And, besides, my sentries
cannot survive above the surface

53:29.318 --> 53:33.788
for too long due to their
life living under the surface.

53:34.890 --> 53:36.358
But what is this thing

53:36.425 --> 53:39.929
that'll save the planet
from climate change?

53:39.995 --> 53:45.301
It is our most ambitious
technological achievement yet.

53:45.367 --> 53:48.270
It has the ability
to repair the ice caps,

53:48.337 --> 53:52.640
to dilute the pollution from
your cities and machines,

53:52.707 --> 53:54.876
heal nature from the ground up.

53:54.944 --> 53:58.481
You will be a hero
not only to your peers,

53:58.547 --> 54:00.883
but in the history books.

54:00.950 --> 54:04.987
People from all different creeds
and color will know you.

54:06.322 --> 54:08.390
I don't think I can do that,
Your Highness.

54:08.457 --> 54:10.692
I only just today found
out that Atlantis is real,

54:10.758 --> 54:12.660
that all of this is real.

54:12.727 --> 54:14.396
And now you're
expecting me to believe

54:14.463 --> 54:16.899
that the world
is going to end?

54:16.966 --> 54:19.001
You're right.
I'm sorry.

54:19.068 --> 54:20.936
This is such
a colossal weight to carry.

54:21.003 --> 54:25.508
I should not have burdened
you with such a heavy cargo

54:25.574 --> 54:28.444
and so soon
after losing loved ones.

54:28.511 --> 54:29.844
I'm sorry.

54:29.912 --> 54:32.982
I understand if you cannot

54:33.048 --> 54:36.751
undertake such
a heroic effort.

54:39.054 --> 54:40.089
Wait.

54:40.156 --> 54:44.059
How does this thing work,
the device?

54:44.126 --> 54:48.531
My scientists will brief you
on the details later.

54:48.597 --> 54:54.669
But it is absolutely essential
that it's activated on dry land.

54:54.736 --> 54:57.573
If I do this,
if I take on this mission,

54:57.640 --> 55:01.776
if I helm your sub, I humbly ask
for just one favor in return.

55:01.843 --> 55:03.379
Name your price,
your heart's desire.

55:03.445 --> 55:05.548
My family.

55:05.614 --> 55:07.815
I know you may not be able to
bring the dead back to life.

55:07.883 --> 55:13.122
But what if they're still out
there just drifting aimlessly?

55:13.189 --> 55:16.292
I need to know
if they're alive...

55:16.358 --> 55:18.027
Or, you know.

55:18.093 --> 55:20.462
I ask that you send your
scouts to search for them.

55:20.529 --> 55:24.066
And if they don't find
anything, then I'll know.

55:26.801 --> 55:29.837
You are a fierce one
for the ones you love.

55:29.905 --> 55:31.373
Consider the bargain set.

55:31.440 --> 55:33.008
I will send my forces
immediately.

55:33.875 --> 55:35.877
Thank you.

55:35.945 --> 55:37.413
You're welcome.

55:37.479 --> 55:39.714
You must be tired.
Return to your chambers.

55:39.781 --> 55:41.283
We launch at dawn.

55:46.989 --> 55:48.823
Did the mainlander prove useful?

55:48.891 --> 55:50.125
Quite useful.

55:50.192 --> 55:51.393
Now go.

55:51.460 --> 55:53.662
Make the necessary changes
to the command sub

55:53.728 --> 55:55.431
so we launch at dawn.

55:55.497 --> 55:57.266
Is the weapon ready
for deployment?

55:57.333 --> 55:58.567
Weapon?

55:58.634 --> 56:00.970
Yes, My King, as requested.

56:01.036 --> 56:02.671
Archimedes and her team
have integrated

56:02.737 --> 56:05.274
the nuclear bomb's core with
the crystallized algae.

56:05.341 --> 56:08.911
This will increase the
destructive fallout 100-fold.

56:08.978 --> 56:11.614
Hmm. Good, good.

56:11.680 --> 56:14.016
Yes, summon me to the harbor
once all has been made ready.

56:14.083 --> 56:16.784
I wish to see
the bomb loaded myself.

56:16.851 --> 56:19.288
Now go.

56:19.355 --> 56:22.658
We have to get to the others
and warn them.

56:22.725 --> 56:23.858
Come on.

56:28.731 --> 56:30.299
Come on, it's okay.

56:39.008 --> 56:40.175
I'm kinda scared.

56:44.812 --> 56:46.615
Ruth, run!

56:46.682 --> 56:47.650
Run, go, I'm right behind you!

56:47.716 --> 56:48.751
- Get the others!
- Stop!

56:48.816 --> 56:50.352
It'll slow 'em down.

56:51.754 --> 56:53.821
Show me what you got, merman.

57:02.464 --> 57:05.534
Is that all you got?

57:05.601 --> 57:06.568
You don't want this.

57:35.798 --> 57:37.032
Aah!

57:45.607 --> 57:46.942
No!

57:48.544 --> 57:50.045
There she is!

57:55.084 --> 57:57.419
And up ahead is our
advanced weapons foundry.

57:57.486 --> 57:59.588
It's here we take
the sunken remains of your wars

57:59.655 --> 58:04.093
and upgrade them into
refined offensive accessories.

58:18.873 --> 58:21.176
This technology
is unprecedented.

58:23.445 --> 58:26.448
Is your ammunition similar
to the artillery we use?

58:26.515 --> 58:29.651
Yes. Well, with the exception
of the biological spears.

58:29.718 --> 58:31.820
The spears are tipped
with crystallized algae

58:31.887 --> 58:35.057
that charge electromagnetically
with our power grid.

58:35.124 --> 58:38.227
Other weapons such as
this grenade contain

58:38.293 --> 58:41.330
concentrated crystallized
bioluminescent algae,

58:41.397 --> 58:43.565
much more powerful
than your explosives

58:43.632 --> 58:46.402
and completely separate
from our power grid.

58:46.468 --> 58:50.038
That's the weaponized mineral
that you mentioned earlier.

58:50.105 --> 58:53.609
Yes. Its unique properties
reinforce the casing,

58:53.675 --> 58:56.578
propel the projectile further,
explode with greater force...

58:56.645 --> 58:58.914
But I thought you said
the algae was sentient.

58:58.981 --> 59:01.350
We do what we must
to protect our city.

59:01.417 --> 59:03.986
I assume it's very volatile.

59:04.052 --> 59:06.890
It merely requires
an ignition source.

59:06.955 --> 59:09.925
And yet you rely on
the enforcement

59:09.992 --> 59:12.961
of an undersea creature,
the Hydra?

59:13.028 --> 59:16.632
Right.
Where is the Hydra right now?

59:16.698 --> 59:18.634
Just out in open water?

59:18.700 --> 59:21.003
Like where we first saw it
when we were on the island?

59:21.069 --> 59:23.005
No.
The Hydra's in its guard post

59:23.071 --> 59:24.406
where we feed it and tend to it.

59:24.473 --> 59:26.141
We only send it to
the open ocean

59:26.208 --> 59:29.945
if we feel the borders of
our city need protecting.

59:30.012 --> 59:31.980
May I?

59:32.047 --> 59:34.483
Of course.

59:38.687 --> 59:42.658
It's truly remarkable how
streamlined your defenses are.

59:42.724 --> 59:44.726
Elegant.

59:44.793 --> 59:48.030
Imagine with these findings what
we could publish for our work,

59:48.096 --> 59:51.733
not to mention all the people
that we could help back home.

59:52.801 --> 59:54.369
There you go again.

59:54.436 --> 59:55.604
V...

59:55.671 --> 59:57.139
Talking about publishing
before helping people.

59:57.206 --> 59:59.475
Del is right.

59:59.541 --> 1:00:05.514
One must make sure one can
trust the findings, correct?

1:00:05.581 --> 1:00:06.648
Of course.

1:00:21.029 --> 1:00:23.165
You know, I've been
meaning to...

1:00:27.636 --> 1:00:29.037
- Ruth! What's...
- Shh, shh!

1:00:29.104 --> 1:00:30.706
They cannot know
that I'm here.

1:00:30.772 --> 1:00:34.109
- What's wrong?
- Who can't know you're here?

1:00:34.176 --> 1:00:35.644
Where's Owen?

1:00:37.479 --> 1:00:39.081
They killed him.

1:00:39.147 --> 1:00:40.716
What?

1:00:40.782 --> 1:00:42.451
The King.

1:00:42.518 --> 1:00:46.655
He fed him to that monster
in the harbor, the Hydra.

1:00:46.722 --> 1:00:49.191
They murdered him.

1:00:50.125 --> 1:00:52.427
No more playing nice.

1:00:52.494 --> 1:00:53.462
Right.

1:00:53.529 --> 1:00:55.364
We gotta get out
of here right now.

1:00:55.430 --> 1:00:56.665
- Yeah, yeah!
- Wait, wait, wait.

1:00:56.732 --> 1:00:57.934
We cannot go without Sam!

1:00:58.001 --> 1:00:59.601
Where is she?

1:00:59.668 --> 1:01:01.136
We have to get to her
before they...

1:01:01.203 --> 1:01:02.571
- Before what?
- The King.

1:01:02.638 --> 1:01:05.474
He has her wrapped
around his little finger.

1:01:05.541 --> 1:01:07.276
She is gonna captain
a submarine

1:01:07.342 --> 1:01:09.946
to the coast and
nuke the mainland.

1:01:10.013 --> 1:01:11.413
No!

1:01:11.480 --> 1:01:13.348
She thinks she's gonna
save the world,

1:01:13.415 --> 1:01:16.151
something about
ending climate change.

1:01:16.218 --> 1:01:17.786
We have to find her.

1:01:17.853 --> 1:01:19.454
Well, what about the chambers,

1:01:19.521 --> 1:01:21.223
where they brought us
when we first got here?

1:01:21.290 --> 1:01:23.026
Yes, yes, let's go.
Come on.

1:01:23.091 --> 1:01:25.427
Someone's coming!
Someone's coming!

1:01:25.494 --> 1:01:26.628
- Hide, hide, hide!
- This way.

1:01:27.997 --> 1:01:29.231
We need to find them.

1:01:29.298 --> 1:01:30.365
With their knowledge
and our tech,

1:01:30.432 --> 1:01:32.467
Atlantis will be unstoppable.

1:01:32.534 --> 1:01:35.270
I told the King not to
trust those mainlanders.

1:01:37.873 --> 1:01:39.474
Wait!

1:01:39.541 --> 1:01:40.509
Take this.

1:01:42.912 --> 1:01:44.246
Make yourself useful?

1:01:53.188 --> 1:01:54.723
Hello.

1:01:58.694 --> 1:02:00.529
Vera, Vera, wait!
What are you doing?

1:02:02.731 --> 1:02:05.367
How did you know to stab that
into the control panel?

1:02:05.434 --> 1:02:07.536
Archimedes said it charges
electromagnetically.

1:02:07.603 --> 1:02:09.438
So any forceful impact
between an electromagnet

1:02:09.504 --> 1:02:11.273
and a conductor
will cause a pulse.

1:02:11.340 --> 1:02:13.742
I thought you were
a marine biologist.

1:02:13.809 --> 1:02:15.577
I minored
in electrical engineering.

1:02:15.644 --> 1:02:17.646
It's good to have options.

1:02:17.713 --> 1:02:22.851
Archimedes also said that
the algae is highly reactive.

1:02:25.253 --> 1:02:27.023
Is there anything on him?
Anything we can use?

1:02:27.090 --> 1:02:28.256
No.

1:02:28.323 --> 1:02:31.760
No keys, no weapons, nothing.

1:02:31.827 --> 1:02:34.931
Can we just steal a submarine
to get out of this place?

1:02:34.998 --> 1:02:36.899
That's the plan and,

1:02:36.966 --> 1:02:39.167
if we can find
some weapons, even better.

1:02:39.234 --> 1:02:41.536
Archimedes showed us how to
work the city's power source.

1:02:41.603 --> 1:02:43.171
If we can get back to
the main generator,

1:02:43.238 --> 1:02:44.740
I can try and
shut down the power

1:02:44.806 --> 1:02:47.776
and we can use that time
to steal a submarine.

1:02:47.843 --> 1:02:50.046
Hey, Ruth, if we run
into some trouble,

1:02:50.113 --> 1:02:51.914
do you think you
can take them down?

1:02:51.981 --> 1:02:53.382
Yeah they're pretty tough,

1:02:53.448 --> 1:02:57.285
but if we take out
their tech, I got this.

1:02:59.354 --> 1:03:00.722
Let's go.

1:03:03.158 --> 1:03:05.260
Come on.

1:03:05.327 --> 1:03:06.795
No, no, no!
Don't touch it.

1:03:06.862 --> 1:03:08.497
It'll still be charged.
Come on.

1:03:17.673 --> 1:03:19.441
The coast is clear.
Let's go.

1:03:22.611 --> 1:03:24.212
In here!

1:03:24.279 --> 1:03:25.681
Come on, come on, come on!

1:03:25.747 --> 1:03:28.417
Come on, the generator
should be just up ahead.

1:03:31.054 --> 1:03:32.187
Halt!

1:03:32.254 --> 1:03:33.255
You two, keep going!

1:03:33.321 --> 1:03:34.823
Watch out! No!

1:03:38.460 --> 1:03:40.963
Are you okay?

1:03:41.030 --> 1:03:42.764
We gotta go!

1:03:45.068 --> 1:03:46.635
Okay, um...

1:03:53.508 --> 1:03:55.577
Okay, we'll secure the room

1:03:55.644 --> 1:03:56.845
while you take care
of the generator.

1:03:56.913 --> 1:03:57.947
Okay.

1:03:58.014 --> 1:03:59.815
Vera, are you sure about this?

1:03:59.882 --> 1:04:00.983
No.

1:04:01.050 --> 1:04:02.584
I don't want you getting hurt.

1:04:02.651 --> 1:04:03.752
I'm not sure, but what's the job
of a scientist

1:04:03.819 --> 1:04:05.220
if not to jump
into the unknown

1:04:05.287 --> 1:04:06.956
for the betterment
of the planet?

1:04:07.023 --> 1:04:09.725
Absolutely.

1:04:09.791 --> 1:04:11.293
I mean, if the spears
are connected

1:04:11.359 --> 1:04:12.594
to the algae power grid,

1:04:12.661 --> 1:04:14.629
if we knock it out,
then it should

1:04:14.696 --> 1:04:17.332
at least disable them...
momentarily.

1:04:17.399 --> 1:04:21.104
My thoughts exactly,
and I believe you.

1:04:21.170 --> 1:04:23.039
Believe me about what?

1:04:23.106 --> 1:04:25.674
That you weren't just interested
in getting your work published.

1:04:34.416 --> 1:04:35.684
Oh, damn it!

1:04:35.751 --> 1:04:36.986
Someone's coming!

1:04:37.053 --> 1:04:38.553
Yeah, I know.

1:04:38.620 --> 1:04:40.388
Vera?

1:04:40.455 --> 1:04:42.257
Vera? They're coming!
We need to hide!

1:04:42.324 --> 1:04:43.825
Come on!

1:04:48.396 --> 1:04:49.932
Are they here?

1:04:49.999 --> 1:04:51.333
They must have heard us coming.

1:04:51.399 --> 1:04:52.734
How could you let them
out of your sight?

1:04:52.801 --> 1:04:55.238
The King will be
most displeased

1:04:55.303 --> 1:04:57.173
with your performance,
Archimedes.

1:04:57.240 --> 1:05:00.642
Of the two of us, whom was
bettered by the outsiders?

1:05:00.709 --> 1:05:03.278
I'm certain I don't
know what you mean.

1:05:03.345 --> 1:05:06.249
Your incompetence seems
to say otherwise.

1:05:06.314 --> 1:05:09.417
- Don't condescend me!
- Enough!

1:05:09.484 --> 1:05:13.189
I want guards posted
on every major passageway!

1:05:13.256 --> 1:05:15.290
We can't let them escape!

1:05:15.357 --> 1:05:17.793
What they could do
with that information...

1:05:17.859 --> 1:05:20.562
Okay, we don't have much time.

1:05:20.629 --> 1:05:22.932
Ruth is right,
this whole place is gonna be

1:05:22.999 --> 1:05:23.966
crawling with guards soon.

1:05:24.033 --> 1:05:25.734
I know, I know.

1:05:25.801 --> 1:05:28.603
Archimedes said the algae's
bioelectric communication

1:05:28.670 --> 1:05:30.405
interacts with our neurology.

1:05:30.472 --> 1:05:34.442
So I just need it to feel
what I want it to do

1:05:34.509 --> 1:05:38.380
just as much as
I need to verbalize it.

1:05:38.446 --> 1:05:40.415
Let's distract Atlantis.

1:05:44.786 --> 1:05:46.621
Come on.

1:05:46.688 --> 1:05:50.026
I mean you and
the ocean no harm.

1:05:52.360 --> 1:05:55.463
Shut everything down.

1:05:58.667 --> 1:06:01.003
Shut everything down!

1:06:13.115 --> 1:06:14.884
Come on!

1:06:17.652 --> 1:06:19.021
The King has been notified.

1:06:19.088 --> 1:06:20.789
Now we will regroup with
the rest of the team.

1:06:20.856 --> 1:06:22.457
We will find these
mainlanders and...

1:06:32.734 --> 1:06:36.138
Sam?
Sam, are you there?

1:06:36.205 --> 1:06:38.040
Sam?
It's Vera.

1:06:42.044 --> 1:06:44.146
- Where is she?
- She should be here.

1:06:44.213 --> 1:06:45.747
I thought you said she came back
to her chambers.

1:06:45.814 --> 1:06:46.848
She did.

1:06:46.916 --> 1:06:49.517
Do you think something
happened to her?

1:06:49.584 --> 1:06:51.888
I don't know.

1:06:51.954 --> 1:06:54.156
Well, we gotta move.
She's gotta be somewhere.

1:06:54.223 --> 1:06:55.157
Let's go.

1:06:59.161 --> 1:07:03.732
I hope you three
are enjoying your escapade.

1:07:03.798 --> 1:07:05.567
Well, my forces and I
don't take too kindly

1:07:05.634 --> 1:07:08.070
to you shutting down our power.

1:07:08.137 --> 1:07:11.240
I don't think your friends
of Atlantis after all.

1:07:11.307 --> 1:07:13.808
You people are murderers.

1:07:13.875 --> 1:07:18.847
Filthy, disgusting monsters!

1:07:18.915 --> 1:07:20.950
Is it true?

1:07:21.017 --> 1:07:23.352
You guys are planning
on dropping a nuclear bomb

1:07:23.418 --> 1:07:26.889
on North America and
triggering a worldwide flood?

1:07:26.956 --> 1:07:30.525
We do what we must for the
preservation of our people.

1:07:30.592 --> 1:07:32.261
So that's how you
justify killing

1:07:32.328 --> 1:07:34.397
billions of innocent people?

1:07:34.462 --> 1:07:36.831
We're providing
a mercy for the planet.

1:07:36.899 --> 1:07:40.535
You're the ones
polluting the oceans!

1:07:40.602 --> 1:07:43.039
We're merely
providing a solution.

1:07:43.105 --> 1:07:44.472
You're sick.

1:07:44.539 --> 1:07:47.776
Enough.
Lock them away in the dungeons.

1:07:49.511 --> 1:07:52.281
Archimedes!

1:07:52.348 --> 1:07:54.383
I bring news from the surface.

1:07:54.449 --> 1:07:56.818
The King wishes
to see us at once.

1:08:01.856 --> 1:08:02.992
Go.

1:08:11.800 --> 1:08:14.569
Preparations are almost
complete, My King.

1:08:14.636 --> 1:08:16.538
My team and I have made
some last-minute upgrades

1:08:16.604 --> 1:08:19.041
to the weapon as specified.

1:08:19.108 --> 1:08:20.875
Its destructive power
should now encompass

1:08:20.943 --> 1:08:23.012
all of the enemy's coastline,

1:08:23.079 --> 1:08:24.914
leaving us a sizeable
part of the west

1:08:24.981 --> 1:08:28.084
to salvage and conquer
at a later time.

1:08:28.150 --> 1:08:32.554
Good. Once again, you make
me proud, Archimedes.

1:08:32.620 --> 1:08:35.291
Atlantis owes you
a debt of gratitude.

1:08:35.358 --> 1:08:37.193
You honor me and my house.

1:08:41.964 --> 1:08:45.234
Your Majesty, the pilot,
as requested.

1:08:45.301 --> 1:08:48.971
Samantha, I trust you
are rested and refreshed.

1:08:49.038 --> 1:08:50.172
Relatively.

1:08:50.239 --> 1:08:51.840
What a day we have ahead of us.

1:08:51.907 --> 1:08:52.874
I hope you're prepared.

1:08:52.942 --> 1:08:54.876
Isn't it magnificent?

1:08:54.944 --> 1:08:56.946
I've had my scientists
fitting your craft

1:08:57.013 --> 1:09:00.182
all night long for
your daring adventure.

1:09:02.684 --> 1:09:05.321
Are you not amazed
by the sights around us?

1:09:05.388 --> 1:09:08.491
I'd prefer to find out
what exactly that is.

1:09:08.556 --> 1:09:10.893
It's merely
a precautionary measure.

1:09:13.695 --> 1:09:15.998
I know a nuke when I see one.

1:09:16.065 --> 1:09:20.236
I do not seek to pull the wool
over your eyes, Samantha.

1:09:20.302 --> 1:09:23.805
The warhead is merely
the submarine's arsenal,

1:09:23.872 --> 1:09:26.042
particularly decorative.

1:09:26.108 --> 1:09:30.612
Funny, calling a weapon of mass
destruction decorative.

1:09:30.678 --> 1:09:33.149
Do I detect a tone of
suspicion in your voice?

1:09:33.215 --> 1:09:34.783
Well, I find it hard
to believe that

1:09:34.849 --> 1:09:36.519
a peaceful planet-saving mission

1:09:36.584 --> 1:09:40.588
requires such destructive
cargo unless forcing hostility

1:09:40.655 --> 1:09:42.925
on mainland was
your intention all along.

1:09:42.992 --> 1:09:47.963
These assumed delusions do not
sit well on your brow, Samantha.

1:09:48.030 --> 1:09:49.365
Now come.

1:09:49.432 --> 1:09:51.599
Let me show you the upgraded
features to the bridge.

1:09:51.666 --> 1:09:53.035
I know what you're planning,

1:09:53.102 --> 1:09:54.669
whether you're willing
to admit or not.

1:09:54.736 --> 1:09:56.038
And I'm letting you have
a chance before you have

1:09:56.105 --> 1:09:57.940
the blood of millions
on your hands.

1:10:00.042 --> 1:10:02.344
Erastos, bring me the prisoner.

1:10:03.578 --> 1:10:04.980
With pleasure, sire.

1:10:10.319 --> 1:10:12.354
Come on!
Come on!

1:10:12.421 --> 1:10:13.989
Just a little bit more.

1:10:15.257 --> 1:10:17.960
Come on, come on.

1:10:18.827 --> 1:10:20.862
Oh, stupid thing!

1:10:20.930 --> 1:10:25.767
- V?
- Oh, good. You're awake.

1:10:25.834 --> 1:10:27.735
How long was I out for?

1:10:27.802 --> 1:10:30.005
I don't know, an hour or so.

1:10:30.072 --> 1:10:32.308
You can thank her snake
of an advisor for that.

1:10:34.876 --> 1:10:36.278
How's Ruth doing?

1:10:36.345 --> 1:10:40.648
She's, um...
she's still processing.

1:10:40.715 --> 1:10:42.784
Just... Just leave her
be for now.

1:10:46.721 --> 1:10:49.024
- Okay? Okay.
- Yeah. Yeah, thank you.

1:10:49.091 --> 1:10:52.094
If I could just get the
right sequence or feeling...

1:10:52.161 --> 1:10:55.364
it's... it's hard to explain.

1:10:58.766 --> 1:11:01.036
You won't get out
of here that way.

1:11:04.739 --> 1:11:06.142
Why did they arrest you?

1:11:06.208 --> 1:11:08.676
I was looking for you
at the palace.

1:11:08.743 --> 1:11:10.045
They didn't like that.

1:11:10.112 --> 1:11:12.448
How did you end up
in Atlantis?

1:11:12.515 --> 1:11:15.251
We'd lost our way.

1:11:15.317 --> 1:11:20.523
We were trying to outmaneuver
a Nazi submarine.

1:11:20.589 --> 1:11:22.857
We were following orders.

1:11:22.925 --> 1:11:24.826
We were diving
through the region

1:11:24.894 --> 1:11:26.295
when we got lost
in the triangle.

1:11:29.165 --> 1:11:33.735
Suddenly everything went black.
Everything went dark.

1:11:33.801 --> 1:11:35.971
<i>Those who were able
to get out of the sub first</i>

1:11:36.038 --> 1:11:37.373
<i>were eaten by the sharks.</i>

1:11:37.439 --> 1:11:39.208
<i>There were hundreds
waiting for us.</i>

1:11:39.275 --> 1:11:40.910
<i>Only a few of us were able
to make it to the shore.</i>

1:11:40.976 --> 1:11:43.312
<i>My righthand man, Horn,
and I jumped together.</i>

1:11:43.379 --> 1:11:45.080
<i>I almost didn't make it
to shore.</i>

1:11:45.147 --> 1:11:47.349
<i>A shark came for me
but Horn saw it first.</i>

1:11:47.416 --> 1:11:49.885
<i>He got in the way.
I tried to save him.</i>

1:11:49.952 --> 1:11:53.821
I will never forget the screams.

1:11:53.889 --> 1:11:55.823
I blacked out for
a long period of time.

1:11:55.891 --> 1:11:58.928
I don't know exactly how long.

1:11:58.994 --> 1:12:02.864
The Atlanteans,
they kept me alive.

1:12:04.400 --> 1:12:06.368
Now I know why.

1:12:06.435 --> 1:12:11.140
They wanted
military information,

1:12:11.207 --> 1:12:14.944
tactics about what we're
doing while we're there.

1:12:15.010 --> 1:12:20.983
I lost a lot of my memory
when I was there,

1:12:21.050 --> 1:12:24.920
but they fed me algae,

1:12:24.987 --> 1:12:28.357
something to
make me remember my past.

1:12:31.694 --> 1:12:34.930
But they misdirected me.

1:12:34.997 --> 1:12:38.833
They thought I was a petty
officer, not a commander.

1:12:38.901 --> 1:12:41.437
And that's why they
never asked you to pilot

1:12:41.503 --> 1:12:43.305
their world-destroying craft.

1:12:43.372 --> 1:12:48.077
But a lot of my memory
did come back.

1:12:48.143 --> 1:12:50.745
It was all a lie,
the way they treated you,

1:12:50.812 --> 1:12:52.747
the way they treated me.

1:12:52.814 --> 1:12:57.785
They will pay for it.

1:12:57.852 --> 1:13:00.522
I'm gonna help you
get out of here.

1:13:04.426 --> 1:13:05.527
And I'm coming with you.

1:13:07.196 --> 1:13:08.397
Deal!

1:13:13.936 --> 1:13:15.404
- Sam!
- Midge!

1:13:15.471 --> 1:13:17.640
Oh, my God,
I thought I lost you!

1:13:17.706 --> 1:13:18.907
I thought I lost you too!

1:13:18.974 --> 1:13:20.175
Are you okay?
Are you hurt?

1:13:20.242 --> 1:13:22.945
Where's Justin?
Where is he?

1:13:23.012 --> 1:13:24.713
Is he okay?

1:13:24.779 --> 1:13:26.148
Midge?

1:13:26.215 --> 1:13:27.849
Midge, where's Justin?

1:13:27.916 --> 1:13:29.418
That's enough for now.

1:13:29.485 --> 1:13:31.253
Erastos!
Erastos, take the prisoner away.

1:13:31.320 --> 1:13:34.390
No! No! Bring her back!
Bring her back right now!

1:13:34.456 --> 1:13:36.959
I've upheld my end
of the bargain,

1:13:37.026 --> 1:13:39.827
a lovely family
reunited once again.

1:13:39.895 --> 1:13:41.829
What did you do to my brother?

1:13:41.897 --> 1:13:43.399
The boy was hurt.

1:13:47.403 --> 1:13:50.872
So I guess you're now using
Midge to keep me in line, huh?

1:13:50.939 --> 1:13:52.975
Is that it?

1:13:53.042 --> 1:13:55.744
I knew I liked you above
your friends the moment

1:13:55.810 --> 1:13:57.713
you stepped foot
into the palace.

1:13:57.780 --> 1:14:00.249
You keep up considerably well.

1:14:00.316 --> 1:14:03.686
And if I refuse?

1:14:03.752 --> 1:14:05.921
I advise you not
to find out what resides

1:14:05.988 --> 1:14:08.390
on the other side
of that thought.

1:14:08.457 --> 1:14:11.826
The sub leaves in one hour
with you commanding it.

1:14:11.894 --> 1:14:14.163
If you want your sister to live,

1:14:14.229 --> 1:14:16.831
I advise you do not
test me any further.

1:14:20.868 --> 1:14:22.738
So we can't go back
to the power room

1:14:22.805 --> 1:14:24.540
since that'll be secured by now.

1:14:24.606 --> 1:14:27.109
So Plan A is a no-go.

1:14:27.176 --> 1:14:29.244
Okay.
So Plan B.

1:14:29.311 --> 1:14:31.480
Plan B is we use
as much of their tech

1:14:31.547 --> 1:14:32.881
against them as possible.

1:14:32.948 --> 1:14:34.583
And we break into
the weapons room

1:14:34.650 --> 1:14:37.086
and we use their weapons to
get to the sub in the harbor.

1:14:37.152 --> 1:14:40.656
The admiral can pilot us
out of here with Sam's help.

1:14:40.723 --> 1:14:42.558
Shh! Someone's coming.

1:14:44.760 --> 1:14:46.528
Last meal!

1:14:49.365 --> 1:14:52.434
What do you mean, last meal?

1:14:52.501 --> 1:14:55.104
Well, you guys are scheduled
to be executed within the hour.

1:14:57.239 --> 1:15:00.642
Death by Hydra, I assume.

1:15:00.709 --> 1:15:02.877
- Shut your mouth.
- You'll be joining them.

1:15:08.384 --> 1:15:09.385
Hey...

1:15:11.954 --> 1:15:14.256
She's out cold.

1:15:15.824 --> 1:15:17.393
Barely!

1:15:17.459 --> 1:15:19.027
Ruth...

1:15:19.094 --> 1:15:20.529
It's for Owen.

1:15:20.596 --> 1:15:23.098
These people need to pay
for what they did.

1:15:25.701 --> 1:15:27.269
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

1:15:27.336 --> 1:15:29.538
Okay, this is it.
Grab whatever you want.

1:15:32.274 --> 1:15:33.842
They must be at the sub.

1:15:33.909 --> 1:15:37.045
Pluto?
Think that suits you.

1:15:37.112 --> 1:15:39.515
A hammer.
That's a good choice.

1:15:39.581 --> 1:15:41.784
They used to call me
that back in the academy.

1:15:41.850 --> 1:15:44.486
But we're gonna have to hit 'em
with something harder than that.

1:15:44.553 --> 1:15:46.622
All right.

1:15:46.688 --> 1:15:48.657
That works.
All right, let's get outta here!

1:15:53.762 --> 1:15:56.632
My Lord, there's been
a breach in the dungeons.

1:15:56.698 --> 1:15:59.468
And I've been alerted of an
explosion in the weapons vault.

1:15:59.535 --> 1:16:03.272
Dispatch the guards to safeguard
the entrance to the harbor.

1:16:03.338 --> 1:16:06.442
I do not want anyone
to interfere with this launch.

1:16:06.508 --> 1:16:07.976
Yes, My King.

1:16:16.952 --> 1:16:18.554
My children!

1:16:18.620 --> 1:16:21.223
Standing before you
is our champion.

1:16:21.290 --> 1:16:24.593
She shall go forth on
our behalf to help usher in

1:16:24.660 --> 1:16:30.499
a new era of prosperity and
power for all Atlantean folk.

1:16:30.566 --> 1:16:34.303
A glorious age when my
kingdom once again

1:16:34.369 --> 1:16:36.872
shall rule over all mankind,

1:16:36.940 --> 1:16:41.510
an age free from the cruel grip
of destructive governments.

1:16:42.778 --> 1:16:46.148
May the gods on
high Olympus watch over us

1:16:46.215 --> 1:16:49.551
and keep our endeavors
forever in their minds.

1:16:50.686 --> 1:16:52.054
Sam!

1:16:52.120 --> 1:16:54.356
Whatever they're forcing
you to do, don't!

1:16:54.423 --> 1:16:55.524
They're just gonna
kill me anyway!

1:16:55.591 --> 1:16:57.226
It doesn't have to be like this.

1:16:57.292 --> 1:16:59.461
You can still call it off.

1:16:59.528 --> 1:17:02.431
Please take our good captain
to the command bridge.

1:17:10.072 --> 1:17:11.139
Where is everybody?

1:17:11.206 --> 1:17:14.042
There they are.

1:17:14.109 --> 1:17:15.344
Shoot the prisoners!

1:17:19.047 --> 1:17:21.683
Don't let them pin us down!
We'll die if we stay here!

1:17:21.750 --> 1:17:26.021
It is a shame finding ourselves
on opposite sides of the board.

1:17:26.088 --> 1:17:27.957
I thought we would
be comrades of learning.

1:17:28.023 --> 1:17:29.191
Do it!

1:17:30.459 --> 1:17:31.727
Ah!

1:17:38.100 --> 1:17:39.434
Keep moving!

1:17:41.203 --> 1:17:42.571
Push them back!

1:17:42.638 --> 1:17:44.540
We can't let them
breach the harbor!

1:17:45.674 --> 1:17:47.676
We must keep fighting!

1:17:47.743 --> 1:17:50.879
Is there another way
back to the harbor?

1:17:50.947 --> 1:17:52.247
Pluto, are you all right?

1:17:52.314 --> 1:17:55.717
You three,
you get ready to run.

1:17:55.784 --> 1:17:58.587
Wait, what?
What are you talking about?

1:17:58.654 --> 1:17:59.655
No!

1:18:05.127 --> 1:18:06.361
Go, go!

1:18:09.731 --> 1:18:10.832
Let them go.

1:18:12.936 --> 1:18:14.603
Prison rats.

1:18:14.670 --> 1:18:16.505
Let's see what strength
you have, mainlander.

1:18:17.573 --> 1:18:18.607
Show me.

1:18:18.674 --> 1:18:22.644
Let me see you
embarrass yourself.

1:18:22.711 --> 1:18:23.913
I won't do it!

1:18:23.980 --> 1:18:26.281
I refuse to be a part
of your heinous plan!

1:18:26.348 --> 1:18:27.984
What a waste.

1:18:28.051 --> 1:18:29.418
Kill the girl!

1:18:29.484 --> 1:18:30.987
- Sam!
- No! Stop!

1:18:31.054 --> 1:18:32.487
Leave them alone!

1:18:32.554 --> 1:18:33.555
Midge!

1:18:33.622 --> 1:18:36.358
Atlanteans!
Do your city proud!

1:18:36.425 --> 1:18:38.794
Remove these outsiders
from my sight!

1:18:41.496 --> 1:18:43.332
Highest marks to you.

1:18:43.398 --> 1:18:45.233
I did not think you could
keep up with an Atlantean.

1:18:45.300 --> 1:18:46.735
It's all talk.
Show me something!

1:18:46.802 --> 1:18:48.770
All right, I'll honor you
with a swift death!

1:18:50.138 --> 1:18:52.240
Catch!

1:19:05.888 --> 1:19:07.856
You should have
stayed away from me!

1:19:17.900 --> 1:19:19.801
V, we've got company!

1:19:27.076 --> 1:19:30.245
Lay down here.

1:19:31.114 --> 1:19:34.249
Uh... uh...

1:19:35.450 --> 1:19:37.352
Stay with me, Midge!

1:19:37.419 --> 1:19:38.654
I'm not going to lose you again!

1:19:43.659 --> 1:19:45.327
- That stuff feels good.
- Yeah?

1:19:45.394 --> 1:19:47.829
Okay, good.

1:19:47.897 --> 1:19:49.598
Grab the vest.

1:19:49.665 --> 1:19:50.799
Yeah.

1:19:55.004 --> 1:19:55.905
Good call.

1:19:55.972 --> 1:19:57.606
Sam!

1:19:58.840 --> 1:20:00.842
Ah!

1:20:00.910 --> 1:20:03.812
Sam! Sam!

1:20:03.879 --> 1:20:05.313
You will take this sub

1:20:05.380 --> 1:20:07.050
to its final destination!

1:20:07.116 --> 1:20:08.483
Guards, take her!

1:20:10.887 --> 1:20:11.921
Come on.

1:20:13.990 --> 1:20:15.323
Back off!

1:20:18.593 --> 1:20:19.962
Vera.

1:20:20.029 --> 1:20:23.398
Drop the weapons.

1:20:26.835 --> 1:20:28.203
Now!

1:20:41.084 --> 1:20:43.052
Do me a favor...

1:20:43.119 --> 1:20:45.587
give my regards to Hades.

1:20:57.033 --> 1:20:58.767
- Sam!
- Run!

1:21:00.702 --> 1:21:01.971
Stupid girl!

1:21:02.038 --> 1:21:04.673
You will not stop me.

1:21:04.740 --> 1:21:06.008
Many have tried.

1:21:06.075 --> 1:21:11.246
You are merely just a name
on a long failed list.

1:21:14.150 --> 1:21:15.484
Stop or burn!

1:21:20.522 --> 1:21:22.424
This is for you, Owen.

1:21:28.530 --> 1:21:32.768
You disappoint me, Sam.
You had so much potential.

1:21:35.104 --> 1:21:36.105
Sam, look at this.

1:21:36.172 --> 1:21:37.305
Midge!

1:21:42.844 --> 1:21:43.879
Pluto?

1:21:49.785 --> 1:21:51.353
No...

1:21:56.058 --> 1:21:57.793
No! No! No! No!

1:22:04.267 --> 1:22:05.534
Go sit there.

1:22:05.600 --> 1:22:06.936
Just take it easy.

1:22:07.003 --> 1:22:09.871
I don't understand.
How am I alive?

1:22:09.939 --> 1:22:11.606
- Sam, are you okay?
- Oh, my God.

1:22:11.673 --> 1:22:14.543
These are my friends,
and this is...

1:22:14.609 --> 1:22:18.647
Out here, they call me Pluto.

1:22:18.713 --> 1:22:21.250
I was an admiral
in World War II.

1:22:21.316 --> 1:22:23.418
All right!

1:22:23.485 --> 1:22:25.320
Everybody strap yourselves in!

1:22:25.387 --> 1:22:28.024
Are you ready and
prepared to launch?

1:22:28.090 --> 1:22:29.357
Yes, sir.

1:22:29.424 --> 1:22:30.927
We're gonna get out of here.

1:22:33.262 --> 1:22:35.264
Full throttle!

1:22:45.473 --> 1:22:46.641
Fools!

1:22:48.110 --> 1:22:50.279
No! No!

1:22:50.345 --> 1:22:52.581
I'm your King! No!

1:22:53.515 --> 1:22:55.184
Man the torpedoes!

1:22:55.251 --> 1:22:57.619
We need to be clear of the city!

1:23:00.689 --> 1:23:02.390
We're clear of the dome!

1:23:04.693 --> 1:23:05.760
Ready...

1:23:05.827 --> 1:23:07.429
Now!

1:23:16.172 --> 1:23:17.839
Hang on to something!

1:23:21.843 --> 1:23:24.546
- We're not gonna make it!
- Just hang on!

1:23:28.284 --> 1:23:30.887
- I love you, V.
- I love you too.

1:23:36.458 --> 1:23:39.761
Everyone okay?
We all okay?

1:23:39.828 --> 1:23:41.030
Yeah.

1:23:43.832 --> 1:23:47.869
You are never
flying me anywhere again.

1:23:47.937 --> 1:23:49.437
I love you too.

1:23:49.504 --> 1:23:54.977
I never saw anything
so beautiful.

1:23:59.181 --> 1:24:00.415
Thank all of you.

1:24:01.850 --> 1:24:02.851
Thank you.
