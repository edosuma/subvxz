WEBVTT

00:18.200 --> 00:20.600
You're in Springwood now.

00:20.666 --> 00:22.666
And you're all mine.

01:16.466 --> 01:17.766
Gotcha!

01:32.166 --> 01:34.033
And we're back in five

01:34.100 --> 01:36.533
'four, three, two..'

01:39.100 --> 01:41.100
No.. Thank you.

01:41.166 --> 01:42.766
Now for those of you
into the tricky terrain

01:42.833 --> 01:43.766
of the subconscious..

01:43.833 --> 01:45.133
We're talking, the fears

01:45.200 --> 01:47.166
the phobias, the fantasy

01:47.233 --> 01:49.633
with dream expert and therapist

01:49.700 --> 01:51.266
Dr. Brandon Kefler.

01:51.333 --> 01:53.866
Author of the outrageously
overpriced

01:53.933 --> 01:56.166
new book "Dream Come True."

01:59.266 --> 02:00.466
Well, doc, uh

02:00.533 --> 02:01.533
audience is ready
to ask you some questions.

02:01.600 --> 02:03.000
Areyouready?

02:03.066 --> 02:04.600
- Absolutely.
- Okay, here we go.

02:04.666 --> 02:06.066
Let's see a show of hands.

02:06.133 --> 02:07.700
Yes, ma'am.
Right there.

02:08.700 --> 02:10.500
My name is Cathy Jennings.

02:10.566 --> 02:12.066
And I'm a single parent.

02:12.133 --> 02:14.066
And I came here about my son.

02:14.133 --> 02:16.966
What seems to be the problem?

02:17.033 --> 02:19.866
Well, he said that he's been
having these nightmares

02:19.933 --> 02:21.933
but he won't talk to me
about them.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.600
At first, I thought it was
just adjusting to a new school.

02:24.666 --> 02:27.966
You know, making new friends
and everything, but..

02:28.033 --> 02:29.433
'Well, it's gotten
to the point now'

02:29.500 --> 02:31.166
'where he doesn't sleep anymore'

02:31.233 --> 02:35.266
and...he really
seems to be terrified.

02:35.333 --> 02:37.000
It sounds like
he's a likely candidate

02:37.066 --> 02:39.233
for "Dream Come True" therapy.

02:39.300 --> 02:41.266
In my book,
I devote an entire chapter

02:41.333 --> 02:43.033
to subconscious manifestation

02:43.100 --> 02:45.233
'of anxiety in teenagers.'

02:45.300 --> 02:46.833
But I can't get answers
from a book.

02:46.900 --> 02:47.966
I need help.

02:48.033 --> 02:49.600
That's why I came here today

02:49.666 --> 02:51.600
to ask you to see my son.

02:51.666 --> 02:54.600
Well, I'm sorry, that's
something I don't normally do.

02:54.666 --> 02:56.033
Well, why not?

02:56.100 --> 02:58.033
I mean, how do we know
that your therapy even works?

02:58.100 --> 03:00.700
I mean, any Tom, Dick or Harry
can write a book.

03:00.766 --> 03:01.833
We want proof.

03:03.833 --> 03:06.066
I'm sure you wouldn't mind
making a house call

03:06.133 --> 03:07.233
would you, doctor?

03:07.300 --> 03:09.733
That is hardly the way
I treat my patients.

03:09.800 --> 03:12.166
Well, hey, if you're
not up for the challenge..

03:12.233 --> 03:13.600
'I mean, I don't even see
how you gonna sell'

03:13.666 --> 03:16.033
the whole lot of your books
with this kind of an attitude.

03:19.500 --> 03:20.766
Alright.

03:20.833 --> 03:22.566
Alright, I'll do it.
I'll see your son.

03:22.633 --> 03:24.866
Oh.
Thank you.

03:26.366 --> 03:28.533
And don't you worry,
we'll have our cameras there

03:28.600 --> 03:31.000
to tell you
if this guy is for real, okay?

03:31.066 --> 03:32.733
'Yeah.'

03:32.800 --> 03:34.366
I mean, who says
the doctors don't make

03:34.433 --> 03:36.700
house calls anymore, huh?

03:36.766 --> 03:38.033
Everybody stay where you are.

03:38.100 --> 03:39.900
We'll be right back
with our next guest.

03:41.300 --> 03:44.533
We interrupt this broadcast
for a special message.

03:44.600 --> 03:46.400
The opinions expressed
on this program

03:46.466 --> 03:48.966
are not necessarily
those of yours truly.

03:49.033 --> 03:50.733
Oh, no, no, no.

03:50.800 --> 03:54.066
I mean, who needs to
read a book about dreams

03:54.133 --> 03:56.066
when you can experience
a nightmare

03:56.133 --> 03:59.833
in full living color?

04:14.000 --> 04:15.833
'And now..'

04:15.900 --> 04:19.133
'Her-r-re's Freddy!'

05:05.666 --> 05:07.400
So grateful
that you're here, doctor.

05:07.466 --> 05:08.533
It'll just be a few nights.

05:08.600 --> 05:10.766
I can't tell you
what I've been through.

05:10.833 --> 05:12.233
Please call me Brandon.

05:12.300 --> 05:13.566
Ah..

05:13.633 --> 05:16.000
You know, Randy
wasn't always like this.

05:16.066 --> 05:17.466
Even after his father died

05:17.533 --> 05:19.400
he was just a normal kid

05:19.466 --> 05:21.933
until we moved here
to Springwood.

05:25.366 --> 05:27.333
Randy, are you alright?

05:28.666 --> 05:30.700
Hey, I'm-I'm great, mom,
I never felt better.

05:30.766 --> 05:32.633
Sweetheart, what happened?

05:32.700 --> 05:34.333
What do you think happened?

05:34.400 --> 05:35.833
Another nightmare?

05:35.900 --> 05:37.833
Gee, mom,
how did you guess that?

05:39.000 --> 05:40.533
Randy, this is Dr. Kefler.

05:40.600 --> 05:43.500
Yeah, I know.
I saw you on the tube.

05:43.566 --> 05:45.066
Thanks a lot, mom,
now the whole town knows

05:45.133 --> 05:46.333
I'm a basket case.

05:46.400 --> 05:48.933
Is that how you
see yourself, Randy?

05:49.000 --> 05:50.400
That's how it is.

05:51.933 --> 05:54.466
I think I can help you, Randy,
if you let me.

05:54.533 --> 05:56.566
Uh, yeah right.

05:56.633 --> 05:58.100
Randy, please.

05:58.166 --> 06:00.466
Let him try.

06:00.533 --> 06:02.533
Please do this for me.

06:05.700 --> 06:07.100
Uh.

06:07.166 --> 06:08.466
What the hell?.

06:08.533 --> 06:10.500
I got nothing to lose,
that's for sure.

06:16.466 --> 06:18.400
Let me know
if I'm in your way.

06:19.933 --> 06:22.433
Feel like I'm in
some kind of freak show.

06:22.500 --> 06:24.833
Once you're in the session
you won't even notice it.

06:26.700 --> 06:28.700
Randy, tell me

06:28.766 --> 06:31.400
when was the last time
you had a good night's sleep?

06:33.200 --> 06:34.600
Couple of weeks.

06:35.966 --> 06:37.900
Why are you so afraid
to go to sleep?

06:39.900 --> 06:42.500
Because he's there.

06:42.566 --> 06:44.500
Whenever I close my eyes

06:44.566 --> 06:45.933
he's there.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.300
Who's there?

06:48.400 --> 06:49.400
Freddy.

06:49.466 --> 06:50.733
Who's Freddy?

06:53.266 --> 06:55.200
You don't wanna know,
trust me.

06:55.266 --> 06:57.166
Oh, but I do wanna know.

06:57.233 --> 06:59.266
Actually I would like to
meet this Freddy.

06:59.333 --> 07:00.900
Unless of course,
he doesn't exist

07:00.966 --> 07:03.133
outside your imagination.

07:03.200 --> 07:05.200
Well, you think
I'm making up this nightmares?

07:05.266 --> 07:08.100
- Get real.
- I will, if you will.

07:08.166 --> 07:09.633
I knew it, you're just like
all the other jerks

07:09.700 --> 07:11.833
she dragged me to,
you don't believe me.

07:11.900 --> 07:13.833
I didn't say that.

07:13.900 --> 07:15.833
- Randy, wait, please.
- Just forget it.

07:15.900 --> 07:16.866
- No.
- Just forget it!

07:16.933 --> 07:18.600
For a minute, please.

07:30.166 --> 07:31.433
Oh.

07:32.300 --> 07:33.633
Randy, what's wrong?

07:34.566 --> 07:35.933
You're wrong, doc.

07:37.100 --> 07:39.333
About me..

07:39.400 --> 07:41.033
...and Freddy.

07:42.600 --> 07:43.666
- Dead wrong.
- Hey, come on.

07:43.733 --> 07:45.033
Put that gun down.

07:45.100 --> 07:47.400
You don't care about me.

07:47.466 --> 07:49.466
You just want to sell books.

07:49.533 --> 07:50.666
That's not true.

07:50.733 --> 07:52.200
Liar.

07:52.266 --> 07:54.200
Put that gun down.

07:59.566 --> 08:00.966
Ah!

08:01.033 --> 08:02.400
Freddy, no!

08:02.466 --> 08:05.333
Trying to get rid off me, huh?

08:06.466 --> 08:08.033
Big mistake, bud..

08:08.100 --> 08:11.133
I'm the only friend you've got.

08:19.266 --> 08:20.566
Leave me alone!

08:20.633 --> 08:25.033
You're really getting to be
a drag, you know.

08:25.100 --> 08:26.400
Look out!

08:38.633 --> 08:40.833
Come on. You're dreaming.
You're dreaming.

08:40.900 --> 08:42.666
There's no one here.

08:42.733 --> 08:44.133
There's no one here.

08:44.200 --> 08:46.733
Son, don't..

09:21.566 --> 09:22.900
Cathy.

09:22.966 --> 09:24.233
Are you alright?

09:24.300 --> 09:26.233
I can't take this anymore.

09:27.433 --> 09:29.400
I just feel so helpless.

09:30.966 --> 09:32.633
This is killing him.

09:32.700 --> 09:34.933
You're not gonna lose him.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.933
I won't let that happen.

09:40.800 --> 09:41.800
Cathy.

09:42.866 --> 09:44.800
I need your help.

09:46.566 --> 09:48.933
What do you want me to do?

09:49.000 --> 09:50.933
Whatever is
in Randy's head

09:51.000 --> 09:53.333
he's given it
a lot of power.

09:53.400 --> 09:55.600
Now, it may
seem like a dream.

09:55.666 --> 09:58.700
But to him,
it's very, very real.

09:58.766 --> 10:00.766
Maybe at some point
it was real.

10:00.833 --> 10:01.933
What do you mean?

10:02.000 --> 10:03.300
Oh, who is this Freddy?

10:03.366 --> 10:04.733
I mean, is it someone you know?

10:04.800 --> 10:07.633
No.
Freddy Krueger.

10:07.700 --> 10:10.100
But Randy never knew him,
he never saw him.

10:10.166 --> 10:11.800
I never saw him.

10:11.866 --> 10:14.100
Until the papers.

10:14.166 --> 10:16.466
- Newspapers?
- 'Yes.'

10:16.533 --> 10:17.833
'It was just horrible.'

10:17.900 --> 10:19.933
He was this insane maniac

10:20.000 --> 10:22.533
who killed
a whole group of people.

10:22.600 --> 10:24.533
And then they caught him..

10:24.600 --> 10:26.533
...and he burned to death.

10:26.600 --> 10:28.933
I mean,
the people set him on fire.

10:31.766 --> 10:33.400
Did you or Randy
see any of this?

10:33.466 --> 10:35.300
No.
Oh, God..

10:35.366 --> 10:37.533
This was long before
we moved here.

10:37.600 --> 10:39.533
That's what I don't understand.

10:39.600 --> 10:42.300
Why should my son
be having these nightmares?

10:42.366 --> 10:44.300
He behaves as if it's real.

10:45.300 --> 10:46.533
Now..

10:46.600 --> 10:49.466
...only until he sees
that it is not real.

10:49.533 --> 10:51.566
This is what I wanna do.

10:51.633 --> 10:53.166
I wanna create a world

10:53.233 --> 10:55.833
where Randy has the power
to destroy this phantom.

11:03.833 --> 11:06.233
I want you to breath deepl

11:06.300 --> 11:07.800
and slowly.

11:09.033 --> 11:11.000
'Relax all your muscles.'

11:13.800 --> 11:16.166
Now close your eyes.

11:16.233 --> 11:17.866
What planet are you from?

11:17.933 --> 11:20.233
I told you,
I doze off, I dream.

11:20.300 --> 11:22.133
I dream, I die.

11:22.200 --> 11:24.133
You won't be dreaming.

11:25.033 --> 11:26.800
How's that?

11:26.866 --> 11:29.266
Because I will tell you
what you will see.

11:29.333 --> 11:31.833
Not you, not Freddy, just me.

11:32.833 --> 11:35.366
I will guide your imagination.

11:35.433 --> 11:37.433
Come on, give me a chance.

11:38.866 --> 11:40.800
I'm with you,
you're not alone.

11:42.800 --> 11:44.433
Come on, together.

11:50.400 --> 11:52.833
- Go for it.
- 'Good boy.'

11:56.933 --> 11:58.900
Now just relax.

12:00.133 --> 12:01.400
Let all the tension

12:01.466 --> 12:03.400
run down your body

12:03.466 --> 12:05.133
and out your toes.

12:07.700 --> 12:09.633
'Just take a deep breath'

12:09.700 --> 12:11.733
'and when you let it out'

12:11.800 --> 12:13.733
'close your eyes.'

12:18.233 --> 12:20.400
'Picture yourself in a park.'

12:21.833 --> 12:23.133
Birds are singin'.

12:26.766 --> 12:28.733
Children are playin'.

12:29.533 --> 12:33.100
Feelthe gentle breeze.

12:37.066 --> 12:39.033
And there's a pleasing aroma.

12:40.400 --> 12:42.333
It's something
you've smelled before.

12:44.633 --> 12:46.466
Mom is baking something.

12:46.533 --> 12:48.900
'It's chocolate chip cookies.'

12:48.966 --> 12:50.333
'Your favorite.'

12:52.133 --> 12:54.300
'It's time to head home now
and get .'

12:56.000 --> 13:00.100
The sun's golden light
washes across the horizon.

13:00.166 --> 13:05.133
And gently evolves
into sweet blue glow of night.

13:05.200 --> 13:06.833
Sweet night.

13:09.066 --> 13:11.000
Alright, you're home now.

13:11.066 --> 13:13.800
It's warm, it's comforting
and it's peaceful.

13:15.733 --> 13:17.700
You reach over
and turn on the lamp.

13:25.233 --> 13:27.300
Who's he kiddin'.

13:27.366 --> 13:29.266
Freddy!

13:29.333 --> 13:30.600
No Freddy!

13:30.666 --> 13:32.500
We're alone.

13:32.566 --> 13:34.466
Alone?

13:34.533 --> 13:36.000
Oh.

13:36.066 --> 13:39.233
I thought
we were in this together.

13:39.300 --> 13:41.233
You're not supposed to be here.

13:43.166 --> 13:44.900
You listenin' to him?

13:44.966 --> 13:46.633
Bad idea, bud.

13:47.466 --> 13:48.566
Now..

13:48.633 --> 13:51.166
...let's see
if you're well-trained.

13:51.233 --> 13:53.233
When I say jump, jump.

13:54.566 --> 13:56.133
Hey.

13:56.200 --> 13:57.466
- Okay..
- No, he's here!

13:57.533 --> 13:59.700
- Freddy's here!
- Nobody's here.

13:59.766 --> 14:02.366
- He cut me!
- I&lt;ro

14:02.433 --> 14:04.133
Hey, turn the thing off.

14:04.200 --> 14:05.533
Oh, sweetheart.

14:07.200 --> 14:08.833
'It's okay, it's okay.'

14:16.433 --> 14:17.800
He'll be okay.

14:20.700 --> 14:21.700
Sweetheart.

14:29.533 --> 14:30.833
Oh, baby.

14:49.533 --> 14:51.700
Not in the books,
is it?

14:51.766 --> 14:53.000
What?

14:53.066 --> 14:54.366
This kid.

14:54.433 --> 14:55.933
The Freddy Krueger thing.

14:58.000 --> 15:01.600
No, it's not something
I've come across before.

15:01.666 --> 15:03.366
But I think
we can get a handle on it.

15:03.433 --> 15:05.500
Look, I don't mean
any disrespect

15:05.566 --> 15:06.966
I'm not a doctor.

15:07.033 --> 15:09.900
I like you, I-I like what you're
trying to do for this kid.

15:10.933 --> 15:13.533
But you don't know
Freddy Krueger.

15:13.600 --> 15:15.533
And you do?

15:15.600 --> 15:17.100
I feel like I do.

15:17.166 --> 15:19.766
I mean, I've covered a lot
of new stories for the station

15:19.833 --> 15:22.900
and we've had some strange
deaths over the years, and..

15:24.633 --> 15:26.166
I don't know.

15:26.233 --> 15:29.800
These deaths, they happened
after Freddy Krueger was killed?

15:29.866 --> 15:31.566
Yeah.

15:31.633 --> 15:33.666
Are you sayin'
Fre-Freddy Krueger had something

15:33.733 --> 15:36.100
to do with these deaths,
after he was dead?

15:38.200 --> 15:39.233
You know what that
sounds like, don't you?

15:39.300 --> 15:41.366
Yeah, like I'm crazy.

15:41.433 --> 15:43.833
Look, all I know is that
there's something strange

15:43.900 --> 15:46.100
happening here
that none of us understands.

15:49.966 --> 15:51.600
Well, maybe not.

15:51.666 --> 15:53.200
But we will.

15:53.266 --> 15:54.766
Look..

15:54.833 --> 15:56.166
...give me half an hour.

15:56.233 --> 15:58.900
I'm gonna try another session
with Randy.

15:58.966 --> 15:59.933
Alright?

16:21.166 --> 16:22.133
Yeah.

16:34.500 --> 16:35.733
Am I gonna die?

16:36.666 --> 16:38.900
No, far from it.

16:38.966 --> 16:40.866
You're gonna be okay.

16:40.933 --> 16:42.433
I.. I've told you
this is real

16:42.500 --> 16:44.500
but you just
don't believe me.

16:44.566 --> 16:46.500
Look, Freddy Krueger is dead.

16:46.566 --> 16:48.766
Come on,
he can't hurt you.

16:48.833 --> 16:50.833
Then how do you explain
these cuts?

16:55.133 --> 16:57.066
Maybe we should start
another session.

16:57.133 --> 16:58.400
What for?

16:59.833 --> 17:01.833
I know what my problem is.

17:03.333 --> 17:04.633
I've got a split personality.

17:14.200 --> 17:15.566
What the hell is happening?

17:15.633 --> 17:17.866
My turn.

17:17.933 --> 17:19.866
Leave the kid alone.

17:19.933 --> 17:21.866
He's mine.

17:21.933 --> 17:25.133
And, uh, you won't be
needing these..

17:26.366 --> 17:28.100
...anymore.

17:35.933 --> 17:40.100
You've given me
a splitting headache!

17:40.166 --> 17:42.166
I think I'll take two aspirins

17:42.233 --> 17:45.933
and...call you in the morning.

17:52.200 --> 17:53.833
Brandon, come here quick.

17:53.900 --> 17:55.533
You won't believe this.

18:14.800 --> 18:16.733
He's sleeping like a baby.

18:49.166 --> 18:50.333
How's he doing?

18:50.400 --> 18:52.200
Well, he seems fine.

18:52.266 --> 18:53.533
But I think
he should be watched

18:53.600 --> 18:54.966
just to be on the safe side.

18:55.033 --> 18:56.400
I don't mind.

18:56.466 --> 18:58.766
Why don't you get some sleep?

18:58.833 --> 19:00.766
Actually I'm not that tired.

19:00.833 --> 19:02.933
Brandon, you've already
done more than..

19:03.000 --> 19:05.700
...anybody thought was possible.

19:05.766 --> 19:07.733
I'm really very grateful.

19:27.366 --> 19:28.333
Hi.

19:30.233 --> 19:31.233
Hi.

19:34.900 --> 19:36.933
You've given me
back my son.

19:38.666 --> 19:41.200
And now I wanna
give you something.

19:51.933 --> 19:54.100
What's up, doc?

19:55.800 --> 19:57.800
Well, well..

19:57.866 --> 19:59.566
what's this?

19:59.633 --> 20:01.333
What's the big idea?

20:01.400 --> 20:03.333
I thought it was just
you and me, babe.

20:03.400 --> 20:05.733
Freddy, I can explain.

20:05.800 --> 20:08.333
The romance is over.

20:08.400 --> 20:10.133
I'm cutting it off right now!

20:12.433 --> 20:14.433
Just you and me, doc.

20:15.466 --> 20:17.400
Let's rock and roll.

20:17.466 --> 20:18.700
Doc!

20:18.766 --> 20:21.066
Doc, he's gone.
Freddy's gone.

20:21.133 --> 20:23.400
I slept almost all night long,
and nothing, nothing happened.

20:23.466 --> 20:24.866
- It was great.
- Are you okay?

20:24.933 --> 20:26.866
Yeah. Yeah, I-I don't know
how you did it

20:26.933 --> 20:29.800
but Freddy's completely
out of my head.

20:29.866 --> 20:31.800
I'm gonna tell mom.

20:43.500 --> 20:45.100
Doc, I gotta get one more shot..

20:45.166 --> 20:46.166
What's the matter?
What's gotten into you?

20:46.233 --> 20:48.066
You were right.
That son of a bitch is real.

20:48.133 --> 20:50.466
You mean Freddy?
You saw him?

20:50.533 --> 20:51.766
Where do you think you're going?

20:51.833 --> 20:53.200
I gotta warn the people.

20:53.266 --> 20:54.600
What happened to Randy?

20:54.666 --> 20:56.733
- He's okay.
- Where's Freddy?

20:57.466 --> 20:58.466
Doc..

20:58.533 --> 21:00.600
'I've gotta get to the studio.'

21:08.700 --> 21:10.700
And, then I actually slept

21:10.766 --> 21:12.266
for the first time in weeks.

21:12.333 --> 21:14.466
I.. It was incredible.

21:14.533 --> 21:16.200
And I owe it all to Dr. Kefler.

21:30.700 --> 21:32.466
Well, I must admit,
I am impressed.

21:32.533 --> 21:34.300
This tells that the guy
really came through for you.

21:34.366 --> 21:36.366
Oh, he is the greatest.

21:38.966 --> 21:40.866
'Cause, you know, there'll
always be sceptics.

21:40.933 --> 21:42.233
Uh, even though
we have the tape

21:42.300 --> 21:45.466
and the testimony
of Randy and his mom.

21:48.966 --> 21:52.100
Dr. Kefler, I wonder
if it was actually you

21:52.166 --> 21:54.100
who cured Randy.

21:54.166 --> 21:55.500
What do you mean?

21:55.566 --> 21:57.200
Of course it was me.

21:57.266 --> 21:59.833
Well, there might be
one gentleman

21:59.900 --> 22:03.266
who could have a different
perspective of the situation.

22:03.333 --> 22:05.133
I think we ought to
bring it out right now

22:05.200 --> 22:06.933
and see what he has to say.

22:07.000 --> 22:10.366
Ladies and gentlemen, let's have
a warm Springwood welcome

22:10.433 --> 22:12.433
for Dr. Freddy Krueger.

22:15.033 --> 22:19.100
You never cured anybody..

22:20.433 --> 22:22.500
I let the kid go

22:22.566 --> 22:25.066
because I wanted you.

22:25.133 --> 22:26.100
No..

22:26.166 --> 22:27.500
Pop goes the weasel!

22:27.566 --> 22:28.900
No, no!

22:36.066 --> 22:38.133
What the hell is that?

22:38.200 --> 22:39.566
Where is he?

22:39.633 --> 22:41.100
Where's Freddy?
Where's Freddy--

22:41.166 --> 22:42.866
Come on, doctor,
get a grip on yourself.

22:51.366 --> 22:54.266
Come on, Freddy,
show your ugly face.

22:56.866 --> 22:58.000
Freeze.

23:40.900 --> 23:43.800
Is there a doctor in the house?

23:44.533 --> 23:46.266
Not anymore.

24:17.400 --> 24:19.733
'Garry Heath, copy, new story.'

24:19.800 --> 24:21.033
'Take one.'

24:22.100 --> 24:24.033
'People complain
about TV violence'

24:24.100 --> 24:26.533
'but what we show in the news
each night's more damaging'

24:26.600 --> 24:28.333
'than anything fiction
could dream up.'

24:28.400 --> 24:29.433
''Cause it's real.'

24:35.100 --> 24:37.633
Why are you so afraid
to go to sleep?

24:40.866 --> 24:43.533
Because he's there.

24:44.700 --> 24:48.033
Whenever I close my eyes,
he's there.

24:48.100 --> 24:49.600
Who's there?

24:50.366 --> 24:51.433
Freddy.

24:55.800 --> 24:57.533
'And justice close-up..'

24:57.600 --> 24:59.800
'The first one at the scene,
last to leave.'

24:59.866 --> 25:02.100
'No one never allowed to blink.'

25:04.000 --> 25:06.766
Come on, Freddy,
show your ugly face.

25:06.833 --> 25:10.333
'Looking for crimes trained me
to see details other can't.'

25:10.400 --> 25:12.033
'The real truth.'

25:12.100 --> 25:14.166
'Now, what is the truth?'

25:14.233 --> 25:15.700
'I knew Dr. Brandon Kefler.'

25:15.766 --> 25:17.433
'He was a level-headed guy,
just trying'

25:17.500 --> 25:18.833
'to help a kid in trouble.'

25:18.900 --> 25:21.800
'But something went very wrong.'

25:21.866 --> 25:24.100
'He was trying
to tell us something.'

25:24.866 --> 25:26.266
'But what?'

25:27.600 --> 25:30.433
'Who or what was behind
this madness?'

25:34.933 --> 25:36.900
What are you starin' at?

25:44.333 --> 25:46.266
Your mobile unit's
waiting for you.

25:46.333 --> 25:47.700
What have we got?

25:47.766 --> 25:50.066
Hmm, another murder
in peaceful little Springwood.

25:50.133 --> 25:52.633
That why Ozzie and Harriet
moved up.

25:52.700 --> 25:54.033
I'm on it.

25:54.933 --> 25:56.700
You seen Judy?

25:56.766 --> 25:58.700
I thought she came in with you.

25:58.766 --> 26:00.400
Yeah, we had a little
fight last night.

26:00.466 --> 26:02.466
She went back to her place

26:02.533 --> 26:05.633
We're gonna have to discuss
this, uh, relationship.

26:05.700 --> 26:08.233
This is, uh, keeping
you away from your work.

26:09.433 --> 26:10.800
Go ahead and burn off some tape

26:10.866 --> 26:13.233
uh, I'll see that
she's there for the on-camera.

26:36.033 --> 26:39.333
Krueger, oh-h-h, you beauty.

26:39.400 --> 26:40.533
How do I look..

26:40.600 --> 26:43.366
O, man of my dreams.

26:43.433 --> 26:47.266
Oh, you fashion plate. Ha ha.

26:47.333 --> 26:49.833
That guy in here
doesn't think so.

26:50.666 --> 26:53.166
But he'll change his mind

26:53.233 --> 26:56.700
if it's the last thing he does.

27:18.366 --> 27:20.400
Excuse me, sir.

27:36.400 --> 27:38.366
Ricky!

27:38.433 --> 27:40.366
- How long you been here?
- About 15 minutes.

27:40.433 --> 27:41.600
You haven't missed much.

27:41.666 --> 27:43.033
Jane Doe's
still in the dumpster.

27:43.100 --> 27:44.800
Have you been shooting
the whole 15 minutes?

27:44.866 --> 27:46.133
On and off.
Why?

27:46.200 --> 27:48.033
Has anyone suspicious
been hanging around here?

27:48.100 --> 27:50.333
Suspicious?
Like who?

27:50.400 --> 27:51.900
You'd know him
if you saw him.

27:51.966 --> 27:54.666
I need to get a killer on tape
for the 5 o'clock..

27:54.733 --> 27:56.700
Yeah, maybe.

27:58.100 --> 27:59.733
And maybe not.

28:00.633 --> 28:03.066
Home base, this is Garry.

28:03.133 --> 28:05.133
I'm sending you a test pattern.

28:05.200 --> 28:06.900
Garry, the lockup signal is fine

28:06.966 --> 28:09.600
but I'm afraid you're gonna
have to do the story solo.

28:09.666 --> 28:11.600
There's still no sign
of Judy anywhere.

28:11.666 --> 28:14.266
'I don't get it. She'd never
stand us up without calling.'

28:14.333 --> 28:16.266
Well, she probably
had a flat tire or something.

28:16.333 --> 28:17.300
That's all.

28:17.366 --> 28:18.700
'And here goes nothing.'

29:10.166 --> 29:11.833
Jackson, you're blocking
my shot, man.

29:11.900 --> 29:14.833
Uh, Garry,
we need to talk.

29:14.900 --> 29:16.966
I'm in the middle of a story.

29:17.033 --> 29:19.300
We've identified the victim.

29:19.366 --> 29:20.933
It's Judy.

29:22.433 --> 29:23.600
What?

29:25.533 --> 29:27.233
That's crazy.

29:27.300 --> 29:28.800
We just had dinner last night.

29:28.866 --> 29:29.933
Man, you made a mistake.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.333
Hey, you don't wanna
see her like this.

29:31.400 --> 29:32.733
She wouldn't have wanted that.

29:32.800 --> 29:34.400
Hey, let it go.

29:34.466 --> 29:36.633
Get that out of
my face, you bastard!

29:38.300 --> 29:40.933
Turn that off, Rick,
before I do it for you!

29:42.533 --> 29:44.533
Just rolling on the story,
nothing personal.

29:44.600 --> 29:46.600
You tell that to Judy.

30:09.033 --> 30:11.233
'Okay, boys, that's all.
Nothing more here to see.'

30:22.466 --> 30:25.966
- 'Sir..'
- Nothing over here.

30:35.200 --> 30:37.933
Come on, Freddy.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.300
I know you're out there
somewhere.

30:42.700 --> 30:44.633
'We've identified the victim.'

30:45.566 --> 30:46.900
'It's Judy.'

30:51.633 --> 30:52.933
What?

30:54.433 --> 30:55.800
That's crazy.

30:57.366 --> 30:59.000
I mean, we-we-we just

30:59.066 --> 31:01.500
had dinner last night, man.

31:01.566 --> 31:02.733
You must've made a mistake.

31:02.800 --> 31:03.966
You don't wanna see her
like this.

31:04.033 --> 31:06.633
She wouldn't have wanted that.
Let it go.

31:08.233 --> 31:10.500
Get that out of my face, man!

31:12.600 --> 31:14.933
That's my girlfriend there.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.400
Turn that off, Rick,
before I do it for you.

31:49.333 --> 31:51.000
'I knew it.'

31:51.066 --> 31:54.300
I knew you crossed the line.

31:54.366 --> 31:56.366
And this time it's no nightmare.

31:56.433 --> 31:58.966
And there you are, Freddy.

31:59.033 --> 32:01.133
I knew you were alive.

32:26.166 --> 32:27.533
Garry, what the hell
is going on?

32:27.600 --> 32:28.933
I'm on to something, Ben.

32:29.000 --> 32:30.500
You won't believe
what I'm on to.

32:30.566 --> 32:33.933
I am talking about roughing up
another station's cameraman.

32:34.766 --> 32:36.700
I know today was a nightmare

32:36.766 --> 32:38.833
but I can't have you
going off the deep end.

32:38.900 --> 32:42.600
I am going to show you the
biggest story of your career.

32:43.700 --> 32:44.866
What are you talking about?

32:44.933 --> 32:47.600
I am talking bigger than
anything you covered

32:47.666 --> 32:51.033
in New York,
'Nam, El Salvador.

32:53.433 --> 32:57.200
Judy...Dr. Kefler..

32:57.266 --> 33:00.266
half the murders in this town,
I can trace back to

33:00.333 --> 33:03.366
the same guy, and you won'
believe who it is.

33:03.433 --> 33:05.433
Well, why don't you
tell me then?

33:07.433 --> 33:09.733
Freddy Krueger.

33:10.900 --> 33:12.466
You're right.
I don't believe it.

33:12.533 --> 33:14.533
Ben, just give me a minute

33:15.900 --> 33:17.233
I've got him here on tape.

33:17.300 --> 33:19.966
He's crossed the line,
he's alive.

33:30.233 --> 33:31.733
'He was there.'

33:32.900 --> 33:34.133
'I had him right there'

33:34.200 --> 33:36.233
in-in the doorway.

33:38.800 --> 33:40.433
Ben. Ben.

33:40.500 --> 33:42.666
I'm, uh, putting you
on Leave of Absence

33:42.733 --> 33:44.033
effective immediately.

33:44.100 --> 33:45.433
Ben, you can't do this for me.

33:45.500 --> 33:47.633
I'm doing it
for your own good.

33:47.700 --> 33:49.433
You're doing this
because you think I'm crazy.

33:49.500 --> 33:51.900
No, I think you're under
a hell of a lot of pressure.

33:51.966 --> 33:55.033
Stress, more than
you can realize.

33:55.100 --> 33:56.766
Look, you just lost
your fiance, Garry.

33:56.833 --> 33:58.866
That's gonna get to anyone.

33:58.933 --> 34:01.200
Now, I want you
to do me a favor.

34:01.266 --> 34:04.500
Go home, get some rest. Hmm?

34:04.566 --> 34:06.933
And stop thinking
about Freddy Krueger.

34:15.466 --> 34:17.100
What was it like?

34:18.366 --> 34:19.900
Well, you remember
what I was going through.

34:19.966 --> 34:21.533
I mean, all I had to do
was nod off, and bam!

34:21.600 --> 34:22.666
Freddy was inside my head.

34:22.733 --> 34:24.966
I mean, that's
all history, right?

34:25.033 --> 34:27.000
No more nightmares?

34:28.200 --> 34:29.400
No.

34:29.466 --> 34:32.100
No, not ever since Dr. Kefler.

34:35.666 --> 34:37.400
Randy..

34:37.466 --> 34:38.966
...what do you think
happened to Dr. Kefler?

34:39.033 --> 34:41.100
And why did he snap like that?

34:45.466 --> 34:46.766
What's it matter what I think?

34:46.833 --> 34:50.100
Oh, come on, Randy, you were
there right before he died

34:52.533 --> 34:54.766
You wanna know what I think?

34:54.833 --> 34:57.200
I'll tell you what I think.
I think Freddy got him.

35:01.100 --> 35:04.200
Dr. Kefler wasn't dreaming
before he was killed.

35:05.100 --> 35:07.433
Yeah, I know that.

35:13.033 --> 35:15.400
You mean Freddy exists
in the real world?

35:16.400 --> 35:18.100
You were there.

35:18.166 --> 35:19.333
You saw the guy flip out.

35:19.400 --> 35:21.700
What do you think?

35:21.766 --> 35:24.033
I think I can prove
Freddy exists.

35:24.100 --> 35:26.333
That he's out there
destroying innocent lives.

35:27.133 --> 35:29.133
But I need your help.

35:32.833 --> 35:35.033
You need to have
your head examined.

35:35.100 --> 35:36.566
I-I've done my time with Freddy.

35:36.633 --> 35:38.300
There ain't no way
I'm going back for seconds.

35:38.366 --> 35:40.366
What happens
if Freddy comes back?

35:40.433 --> 35:43.500
How can be sure you're cured
until we expose Freddy?

35:54.466 --> 35:56.966
I can't believe
I'm saying yes to this.

35:57.033 --> 35:59.100
Alright. What you want me to do?

35:59.166 --> 36:02.933
Meet me at this address
at 10:30 tonight.

36:57.266 --> 36:59.366
Hey! I found this place.

36:59.433 --> 37:01.533
Get out of here
before I call the cops.

37:10.900 --> 37:14.766
Neat how I can do this,
ain't it, there?

37:14.833 --> 37:17.433
Now, you'll be
the one to blame

37:17.500 --> 37:20.200
for a change.
Ha ha ha.

37:24.133 --> 37:26.700
I'm sorry I'm late,
but you give lousy directions.

37:31.900 --> 37:33.833
You think this could go
a little bit fast?

37:38.433 --> 37:40.433
Judy was killed
right over there.

37:41.633 --> 37:43.600
And that's where we start.

38:42.233 --> 38:44.666
Would you mind telling me
what we're looking for?

38:44.733 --> 38:45.933
Evidence.

38:47.500 --> 38:49.533
That Freddy was here.

38:50.466 --> 38:53.200
And still is here.

39:18.833 --> 39:22.200
How did you know that
that was in there?

39:22.266 --> 39:24.633
- Call the police fast.
- How did you know that?

39:43.300 --> 39:45.333
'"U R here and so am I." '

39:48.733 --> 39:50.700
Garry.

40:13.800 --> 40:14.800
I mean, what I can't figure out

40:14.866 --> 40:15.933
is how he seemed to know

40:16.000 --> 40:17.633
right where to find the body.

40:17.700 --> 40:18.900
What were you doing here?

40:20.066 --> 40:21.833
Garry said that he was gonna

40:21.900 --> 40:25.100
prove that
Freddy Krueger's alive.

40:25.166 --> 40:27.033
I want APB
put out on Garry Heath.

40:27.100 --> 40:28.433
And cordon off the area.

40:29.333 --> 40:30.700
He's around here somewhere

40:38.066 --> 40:39.433
Come on, Freddy!

40:41.200 --> 40:42.700
I know you're here!

40:46.033 --> 40:47.533
Why are you afraid of me?

40:49.700 --> 40:51.166
What are you hiding for?

40:58.966 --> 41:01.300
Testing, one, two, three.

41:01.366 --> 41:02.533
'Are you receiving me?'

41:02.600 --> 41:05.133
Garry, what the hell
do you think you're doing?

41:05.200 --> 41:06.533
To embattle with Freddy.

41:08.000 --> 41:09.366
Just one shot, Ben.

41:09.433 --> 41:11.366
Roll all
the backup tapes you can.

41:11.433 --> 41:12.833
Do what he says.

41:12.900 --> 41:14.300
And tell engineering
to run a tracer

41:14.366 --> 41:15.633
on his transmissions.

41:16.733 --> 41:18.066
He's here.

41:19.200 --> 41:21.200
I can feel him
inside my head.

41:23.533 --> 41:24.833
But this is no nightmare.

41:34.400 --> 41:35.700
No nightmare?

41:36.266 --> 41:37.966
Says who?

41:38.033 --> 41:39.900
'It's Freddy! He's here!'

41:39.966 --> 41:41.500
Well, who'd you expect?

41:41.566 --> 41:43.033
The Avon lady?

41:43.100 --> 41:45.066
'That's it, Freddy.
Keep talking.'

41:45.133 --> 41:47.400
'Let the world know
what's on your twisted mind.'

41:47.466 --> 41:48.500
Shut up.

41:48.566 --> 41:50.466
Move your camera
a little bit this way.

41:50.533 --> 41:52.533
I want you to get my, uh..

41:52.600 --> 41:55.200
...good side.

41:55.266 --> 41:57.600
'Are you getting all this
on tape? You better be.'

41:58.966 --> 42:02.166
The man has totally
gone off the deep end.

42:02.233 --> 42:03.600
Who is he talking to?

42:06.566 --> 42:09.400
Damn it, Garry.
Go home and get some rest.

42:10.900 --> 42:12.066
That's it, Freddy.

42:12.133 --> 42:14.233
Attack me like you did Judy.

42:14.300 --> 42:15.833
No, no.

42:15.900 --> 42:18.633
That was your sloppy work.

42:18.700 --> 42:20.000
Youreally&lt;row16

42:20.066 --> 42:21.900
a number on her, champ.

42:21.966 --> 42:23.733
That's a lie!

42:23.800 --> 42:25.366
Maybe.

42:25.433 --> 42:27.300
Maybe not!

42:33.433 --> 42:34.600
Ben, this is Jackson.

42:34.666 --> 42:36.500
We're looking for
your cameraman Garry Heath.

42:36.566 --> 42:38.300
Any idea where he might be?

42:38.366 --> 42:39.500
'As a matter of fact, I do.'

42:39.566 --> 42:41.200
'He's transmitting
from a warehouse'

42:41.266 --> 42:42.466
'on Northfield Road.'

42:42.533 --> 42:44.000
Thanks, Ben.
I'll get back to you.

42:44.066 --> 42:45.666
Wait. What's going on?

42:45.733 --> 42:47.466
Why are you looking for him?

42:47.533 --> 42:49.100
He just struck again.

42:49.166 --> 42:50.600
What do you mean,
"He struck again?"

42:52.100 --> 42:53.800
Judy's autopsy revealed traces

42:53.866 --> 42:55.600
of Garry's clothing
all over her.

42:57.200 --> 42:58.433
He killed her, Ben.

43:04.966 --> 43:07.466
You killed that wino.
Admit it, damn it!

43:07.533 --> 43:08.500
Yeah.

43:08.566 --> 43:09.933
But without the body.

43:11.466 --> 43:13.000
Think about it.

43:13.066 --> 43:15.000
You used me.

43:15.100 --> 43:16.166
Why?

43:16.233 --> 43:18.500
Oh, gee, I don't know.

43:18.566 --> 43:20.900
Uh, 'cause it's fun?

43:22.200 --> 43:24.133
'You used me to kill them.'

43:24.200 --> 43:25.733
'But you're the guilty one!'

43:26.966 --> 43:31.266
Yeah. But I'm dead.
What's your excuse?

44:07.166 --> 44:09.333
And that's the way it is.

44:10.800 --> 44:13.466
I always wanted to be on TV.

44:13.533 --> 44:15.533
Maybe now they'll
give me my own show.

44:16.933 --> 44:18.600
Oh, I think I love you.
