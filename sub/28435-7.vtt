00:02.667 --> 00:04.998
# We're not going out

00:04.999 --> 00:06.998
# Not staying in

00:06.999 --> 00:09.800
# Just hanging around
With my head in a spin

00:09.801 --> 00:12.800
# But there is no need
to scream and shout

00:12.801 --> 00:15.998
# We're not going out

00:15.999 --> 00:18.999
# We are not going out. #

00:21.852 --> 00:23.851
How are you getting on
at your mum and dad's?

00:23.852 --> 00:25.852
<font color="#FFFF00"> They're treating me like
I'm ten years old again. </font>Oh, yeah?

00:25.853 --> 00:27.851
Sending you out to buy fags

00:27.852 --> 00:29.985
and making you pretend to
the bailiffs that they're not in?

00:29.986 --> 00:33.252
<font color="#FFFF00"> We had very different childhoods,
didn't we?</font>

00:33.253 --> 00:34.817
This is what it'd be like
if we got divorced.

00:34.819 --> 00:37.283
<font color="#FFFF00"> What? You in the house and
me at my parents' with the kids?</font>

00:37.284 --> 00:39.086
<font color="#FFFF00"> You must know a good lawyer.</font>

00:40.086 --> 00:42.283
<font color="#FFFF00"> Did you have a proper go
at this kitchen fitter</font>

00:42.284 --> 00:43.284
<font color="#FFFF00"> for going over the deadline?</font>

00:43.285 --> 00:45.284
<font color="#FFFF00"> I know how you hate confrontation.</font>

00:45.285 --> 00:46.951
That's not true.

00:46.952 --> 00:49.283
<font color="#FFFF00"> Well, whenever you get a dodgy meal,
you never complain.</font>

00:49.284 --> 00:51.086
I know, but you do your best.

00:53.284 --> 00:55.284
<font color="#FFFF00"> I mean in restaurants!</font>

00:56.284 --> 00:58.283
Oh.
HE CHUCKLES

00:58.284 --> 00:59.417
<font color="#FFFF00"> Why don't we just go with
the fitters</font>

00:59.418 --> 01:01.283
<font color="#FFFF00"> that Anna and Toby recommended?</font>

01:01.284 --> 01:04.283
Because you pay these building
companies by the length of the name.

01:04.284 --> 01:07.551
Why would we want to pay
Marcus Fothergill Brightwaters
Elite Kitchen Solutions

01:07.552 --> 01:10.086
when we can pay a bloke called Dave?

01:11.284 --> 01:13.283
<font color="#FFFF00"> I'm going insane here.</font>

01:13.284 --> 01:14.284
Aw, you've got it easy.

01:14.285 --> 01:16.818
I'm the one that's stuck here
without any water.

01:16.819 --> 01:18.283
I'm having to wee in the garden.

01:18.284 --> 01:20.818
<font color="#FFFF00"> Well, I hope neighbours
aren't seeing you! </font>Fair point.

01:20.819 --> 01:23.283
I'll start using the back garden.

01:23.284 --> 01:24.284
<font color="#FFFF00"> Tell me honestly, Lee,</font>

01:24.285 --> 01:28.085
<font color="#FFFF00"> will he definitely be finished
by Friday? </font>Yes, I promise.

01:28.086 --> 01:29.819
He's virtually finished.

01:32.284 --> 01:35.283
<font color="#FFFF00"> I'm not joking, Lee. You need to
have a word with him right now</font>

01:35.284 --> 01:36.284
<font color="#FFFF00"> and tell him,
in no uncertain terms,</font>

01:36.285 --> 01:39.283
<font color="#FFFF00"> he needs to be done by Friday
or he's in big trouble.</font>

01:39.284 --> 01:41.218
<font color="#FFFF00"> OK?</font>

01:41.219 --> 01:42.951
Love you, sweet cheeks.

01:42.952 --> 01:45.218
Not you.

01:45.219 --> 01:47.283
So, how's it going?

01:47.284 --> 01:51.284
<font color="#00FFFF"> Yeah. The really hard work's
behind me. </font>Yeah, I can see that.

01:53.086 --> 01:55.283
<font color="#00FFFF"> Thing is... </font>Yeah?</font>

01:55.284 --> 01:58.283
I'm just wondering about
this deadline on Friday.

01:58.284 --> 02:00.551
<font color="#00FFFF"> Oh, don't worry about this,
this is just surface.</font>

02:00.552 --> 02:03.283
<font color="#00FFFF"> It'll all come together
in the last couple of days. </font>Right.

02:03.920 --> 02:07.919
It's just that this is
the last couple days.

02:07.920 --> 02:09.919
You see, what I need...
Um, well, not need, obviously,

02:09.919 --> 02:11.919
it's more of a request.

02:11.920 --> 02:16.919
I say request, it's a favour,
if that's not too strong a word.

02:16.920 --> 02:19.919
<font color="#00FFFF"> I'm not quite sure what it is
you're trying to ask me,</font>

02:19.920 --> 02:22.919
<font color="#00FFFF"> but would it be easier
over a cup of tea?</font>

02:22.920 --> 02:23.920
Sure.

02:27.920 --> 02:29.854
Ah, there you go, you see -

02:29.855 --> 02:31.919
you'd like a cup of tea,
I'd like a cup of tea,

02:31.920 --> 02:34.919
my wife would love to come home
and have a cup of tea,

02:34.920 --> 02:37.919
everyone wants a cup of tea,
but there's one vital ingredient
missing, isn't it?

02:37.920 --> 02:40.919
<font color="#00FFFF"> Yeah, you're right - biscuits.</font>

02:40.920 --> 02:43.920
<font color="#00FFFF"> Ah, don't worry.
Found your secret stash.</font>

02:51.921 --> 02:54.919
<font color="#FFFF00"> What have you been doing?
You've been gone ages.</font>

02:54.920 --> 02:57.919
I've been using the gents
for an all-over body wash.

02:57.920 --> 02:58.920
<font color="#FFFF00"> Blimey.</font>

02:58.921 --> 03:01.187
<font color="#FFFF00"> I get embarrassed
when I plug in my laptop.</font>

03:01.188 --> 03:04.919
Yeah, I'm not surprised with
your Michael Buble screensaver.

03:04.920 --> 03:06.919
<font color="#FFFF00"> If you'd employed the fitters
we used,</font>

03:06.920 --> 03:08.854
<font color="#FFFF00"> you wouldn't be in this mess.</font>

03:08.855 --> 03:10.919
Look, he's all right my builder,
he's just a bit old-school,

03:10.920 --> 03:13.053
you know, rolled up copy of The Sun,

03:13.054 --> 03:14.919
some very patriotic tattoos,

03:14.920 --> 03:16.920
and a bum crack
you could park a moped in.

03:17.920 --> 03:19.587
<font color="#FFFF00"> Oh, I get it.</font>

03:19.588 --> 03:21.187
<font color="#FFFF00"> You're scared of him.</font>

03:21.188 --> 03:22.919
I'm not scared of him.

03:22.920 --> 03:24.919
I'm scared of Lucy.

03:24.920 --> 03:26.919
<font color="#FFFF00"> And what did she say
when you told her</font>

03:26.920 --> 03:29.625
<font color="#FFFF00"> it wasn't going to be finished
on time again.</font>

03:29.627 --> 03:31.473
I didn't tell her.

03:31.475 --> 03:33.894
<font color="#FFFF00"> Why do you fear confrontation
so much?</font>

03:33.895 --> 03:35.626
<font color="#FFFF00"> You're as soft as...</font>

03:35.627 --> 03:36.627
You?

03:37.761 --> 03:41.626
<font color="#FFFF00"> Listen, I know how to deal
with workmen in my house.</font>

03:41.627 --> 03:44.626
<font color="#FFFF00"> I get a written estimate,
I keep a close eye on the work,</font>

03:44.627 --> 03:46.626
<font color="#FFFF00"> and if anything goes off schedule...</font>

03:46.627 --> 03:47.895
<font color="#FFFF00"> ..I get Anna to talk to them.</font>

03:49.627 --> 03:52.428
<font color="#FFFF00"> What does she do?</font>
She lays down the law -</font>

03:52.429 --> 03:54.626
<font color="#FFFF00"> no boots in the house,
no tea breaks, no music,</font>

03:54.627 --> 03:56.626
<font color="#FFFF00"> no chatting, no laughing,</font>

03:56.627 --> 03:58.627
<font color="#FFFF00"> no using anything
other than the outside Portaloo.</font>

03:58.628 --> 04:01.295
Yeah, but what are the rules
for the workmen?

04:02.562 --> 04:03.626
<font color="#FFFF00"> She gets results.</font>

04:03.627 --> 04:05.626
Yeah, but I don't like all that
"them and us" stuff

04:05.627 --> 04:08.429
<font color="#FFFF00"> bossing someone round like I'm...</font>
Their boss?</font>

04:09.429 --> 04:10.626
I just can't do it.

04:10.627 --> 04:13.626
I know Dave probably sees me
as some sort of middle class ponce.

04:13.627 --> 04:15.627
<font color="#FFFF00"> Bloody hell, how rough is he?</font>

04:18.628 --> 04:22.561
He's looked round our kitchen
and he's seen all the evidence -

04:22.562 --> 04:26.626
spiralizer, Le Creuset set,
strawberry huller.

04:26.627 --> 04:27.894
Blimey, if you'd have told me
when I was 18

04:27.895 --> 04:30.626
one day I'd own a gadget for
taking the tops off strawberries...

04:30.627 --> 04:33.626
<font color="#FFFF00"> You'd have said,
"What's a strawberry?"</font>

04:33.627 --> 04:36.626
But all that stuff,
it's not really me.

04:36.627 --> 04:38.626
I'm from a working-class background.

04:38.627 --> 04:39.627
<font color="#FFFF00"> Are you?</font>

04:39.628 --> 04:41.626
<font color="#FFFF00"> You never really mention it.</font>

04:41.627 --> 04:44.626
That's why I can't lord it over him,

04:44.627 --> 04:46.561
I'm trying to be something I'm not.

04:46.562 --> 04:48.626
Doesn't cut any ice,
but I'll tell you what will...

04:48.627 --> 04:51.627
<font color="#FFFF00"> Your complete set of Selfridges
ice chisels?</font>

04:52.627 --> 04:56.626
A matey chat, like equals -

04:56.627 --> 04:58.628
man to man, bloke to bloke.

05:01.627 --> 05:03.028
<font color="#FFFF00"> Oh, yeah...</font>

05:06.562 --> 05:09.627
<font color="#FFFF00"> Well, you'll carry that off
with your lemon-scented armpits.</font>

05:12.627 --> 05:14.626
<font color="#FFFF00"> You can come to us for a shower,
you know.</font>

05:14.627 --> 05:17.626
I don't think Anna would approve of
me walking around your house naked.

05:17.627 --> 05:20.626
<font color="#FFFF00"> Good point. She's not particularly
keen on you being there</font>

05:20.627 --> 05:22.028
<font color="#FFFF00"> when you've got your clothes on.</font>

05:24.000 --> 05:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:34.627 --> 05:36.627
Dave, mate, how's it going?

05:38.627 --> 05:40.626
<font color="#00FFFF"> Yeah, yeah, making progress.</font>

05:40.627 --> 05:43.626
Yeah, I can see you're getting
though things.

05:43.627 --> 05:45.561
<font color="#00FFFF"> Oh, yeah, the biscuits.</font>

05:45.562 --> 05:46.627
No need to apologise.

05:46.628 --> 05:49.626
<font color="#00FFFF"> I wasn't. I was going to say
we need some more.</font>

05:49.627 --> 05:52.626
It's funny you should say that
because I'd just been for a coffee -

05:52.627 --> 05:54.626
I say coffee,
I mean a couple of jars...

05:54.627 --> 05:57.626
<font color="#00FFFF"> What? You drank two jars of coffee?</font>

05:57.627 --> 05:59.626
..and on the way back I thought,
"I bet Dave's peckish.

05:59.627 --> 06:03.626
"I'll get him an all-day fry-up
in a bap, on white bread,

06:03.627 --> 06:05.626
"Yorkie for afters."

06:05.627 --> 06:06.627
<font color="#00FFFF"> Nice one, mate.</font>

06:06.628 --> 06:08.626
<font color="#00FFFF"> Diet starts tomorrow, eh? </font>Yeah.

06:08.627 --> 06:10.429
Like a lot of things.

06:11.627 --> 06:13.626
It's good to keep
your blood sugar levels up.

06:13.627 --> 06:15.626
I know what it's like
when you're grafting

06:15.627 --> 06:17.760
I used to be on the game...
Uh, in the game.

06:17.761 --> 06:19.626
<font color="#00FFFF"> Oh, yeah? Builder were you?</font>
Oh, yeah.

06:19.627 --> 06:22.627
Worked with my hands for years -
on the sites, down the docks,

06:22.628 --> 06:24.626
in the... woods.

06:24.627 --> 06:27.626
I've done it all, me -
pointing, grouting...

06:27.627 --> 06:29.626
..flossing.

06:29.627 --> 06:32.626
Some of the stuff I used to
get up to. Oh, I used to...

06:32.627 --> 06:34.626
I did all the tricks, me,
you know. Oh!

06:34.627 --> 06:37.428
Glues not screws,
if all else fails, bang in nails,

06:37.429 --> 06:39.626
extended coffee breaks,
crafty fags...

06:39.627 --> 06:41.627
<font color="#00FFFF"> Peeing in the sink. </font>What?

06:43.562 --> 06:44.627
<font color="#00FFFF"> Only joking.</font>

06:44.628 --> 06:47.626
Yeah, I know that,
you're not like other builders.

06:47.627 --> 06:50.626
In fact, in a lot of ways,
you're not like a builder at all.

06:50.627 --> 06:52.428
<font color="#00FFFF"> Cheers, mate, it's nice to hear</font>

06:52.429 --> 06:55.626
<font color="#00FFFF"> cos I did wonder if you're a bit
narked about the pace of the job.</font>

06:55.627 --> 06:57.626
Narked? Don't be silly, mate.

06:57.627 --> 07:00.027
Eh? It takes as long as it takes.

07:00.028 --> 07:01.626
You're an artist.

07:01.627 --> 07:04.626
I mean, how long did it take
to do the Sistine Chapel?

07:04.627 --> 07:06.028
<font color="#00FFFF"> Dunno, wasn't one of mine.</font>

07:07.429 --> 07:09.626
It was Michelangelo,
and it took him four years.

07:09.627 --> 07:11.161
Do you know why?

07:11.162 --> 07:13.626
Cos he didn't have my wife
breathing down his neck.

07:13.627 --> 07:15.760
<font color="#00FFFF"> You know what I'm saying?</font>
Bending your ear, is she?</font>

07:15.761 --> 07:17.760
Oh, Dave, mate,
she's never off my back.

07:17.761 --> 07:21.161
<font color="#00FFFF"> Oh, I feel your pain, mate.</font>
Oh, yeah, your wife give you grief?

07:21.162 --> 07:22.626
<font color="#00FFFF"> Oh, you could say that.</font>

07:22.627 --> 07:24.162
<font color="#00FFFF"> She's dead.</font>

07:25.627 --> 07:27.626
Right. Sorry about that.

07:27.627 --> 07:28.627
<font color="#00FFFF"> Not really!</font>

07:30.627 --> 07:33.626
<font color="#00FFFF"> Got you there. </font>Ha-ha!
Bants, I love it.

07:33.627 --> 07:35.626
<font color="#00FFFF"> So how come I haven't met
your good lady yet?</font>

07:35.627 --> 07:38.626
Well, she likes to keep away
when the work's being done.

07:38.627 --> 07:41.626
She gets a bit petty about
not being able to cook or wash

07:41.627 --> 07:43.561
or having to breathe in asbestos.

07:43.562 --> 07:45.626
<font color="#00FFFF"> Ha! Women! </font>Yeah.</font>

07:45.627 --> 07:48.626
<font color="#00FFFF"> So I suppose this is a bit of a nice
holiday for you without her, eh?</font>

07:48.627 --> 07:51.626
<font color="#00FFFF"> Ha, yeah. </font>Yeah, you probably want me
to take as long as possible.</font>

07:51.627 --> 07:54.027
Oh, no, I really don't.

07:54.028 --> 07:56.626
No, she'll kill me if he's not ready
by the deadline,

07:56.627 --> 07:58.626
you know, this Friday.

07:58.627 --> 08:03.028
It is definitely doable by Friday,
isn't it, mate?

08:04.628 --> 08:06.562
Vimto?

08:08.627 --> 08:11.161
<font color="#00FFFF"> Tell her it'll be done by Friday,
no worries.</font>

08:11.162 --> 08:14.626
<font color="#00FFFF"> Oh, cheers, mate, that's brilliant.</font>
I wouldn't say that to just anyone,</font>

08:14.627 --> 08:16.894
<font color="#00FFFF"> but, as it's you, I'm going to
really get my nose to the grindstone</font>

08:16.895 --> 08:19.294
<font color="#00FFFF"> and make sure we finish
at the agreed time.</font>

08:19.295 --> 08:21.626
That's really good of you, cheers.

08:21.627 --> 08:25.626
So, just to be absolutely clear,
I can phone my wife now

08:25.627 --> 08:27.626
and tell her it's definitely
going to be done by Friday?

08:27.627 --> 08:29.626
<font color="#00FFFF"> Absolutely. </font>Great!

08:29.627 --> 08:31.626
<font color="#00FFFF"> But if we need a plan B...</font>

08:31.627 --> 08:32.626
What?

08:32.628 --> 08:35.626
<font color="#00FFFF"> I'm just saying IF we need a plan B,
which we won't,</font>

08:35.626 --> 08:37.626
<font color="#00FFFF"> what we can do to get
your missus off your back, right,</font>

08:37.626 --> 08:40.626
<font color="#00FFFF"> is tell her we need a seven gauge
retractable pinion bracket.</font>

08:40.626 --> 08:43.626
And do we need a seven gauge
retractable pinion bracket?

08:43.626 --> 08:45.627
<font color="#00FFFF"> Bloody hope not!
There's no such thing.</font>

08:46.761 --> 08:49.626
<font color="#00FFFF"> What am I like?!</font>
I'm assuming that's rhetorical.

08:49.627 --> 08:51.626
But plan B won't be needed, right,

08:51.627 --> 08:53.760
because it'll definitely be done
by this Friday?

08:53.761 --> 08:57.561
<font color="#00FFFF"> No question,
absolutely 110% guaranteed.</font>

08:57.562 --> 08:58.626
OK.

08:58.627 --> 08:59.627
<font color="#00FFFF"> But if it isn't...</font>

09:00.627 --> 09:04.161
If it isn't? <font color="#00FFFF"> ..which it will be,
absolutely for certain... </font>Right.

09:04.162 --> 09:07.626
<font color="#00FFFF"> ..but if it isn't, then Monday
at the absolute latest.</font>

09:07.627 --> 09:09.429
<font color="#00FFFF"> Certainly no later than Tuesday.</font>

09:10.627 --> 09:12.627
<font color="#00FFFF"> Tuesday? </font>All being well.</font>

09:13.627 --> 09:14.627
<font color="#00FFFF"> Right, there it is.</font>

09:14.628 --> 09:15.895
<font color="#00FFFF"> Yep.</font>

09:19.627 --> 09:21.627
<font color="#00FFFF"> Oh, do us a favour, mate.</font>

09:36.627 --> 09:38.428
Oh. Hi, Anna.

09:38.429 --> 09:39.626
<font color="#FFFF00"> Hello, Lee. How are you?</font>

09:39.627 --> 09:42.027
<font color="#FFFF00"> Just seeing how things are going.</font>

09:42.028 --> 09:45.626
I think one of your earrings
is heavier than the other.

09:45.627 --> 09:46.627
<font color="#FFFF00"> Just thought I'd check in</font>

09:46.628 --> 09:48.626
<font color="#FFFF00"> and let Lucy know what's happening
with the kitchen.</font>

09:48.627 --> 09:50.626
<font color="#FFFF00"> I feel it's my duty as her friend.</font>

09:50.627 --> 09:52.626
Well, you can't see it
until it's finished.

09:52.627 --> 09:55.294
<font color="#FFFF00"> It's not a Picasso. </font>It's starting
to look like one.

09:55.295 --> 09:57.627
<font color="#FFFF00"> I see. Toby said things
weren't quite going to plan.</font>

09:57.628 --> 09:59.626
<font color="#FFFF00"> Everything's under control. </font>Good.</font>

09:59.627 --> 10:02.028
<font color="#FFFF00"> Well, you won't mind me taking
a quick look, then.</font>

10:04.162 --> 10:07.428
<font color="#FFFF00"> Dear God, it's like the trenches
of World War I.</font>

10:07.429 --> 10:09.626
<font color="#FFFF00"> But with no poetry.</font>

10:09.627 --> 10:12.626
<font color="#FFFF00"> And even less chance of it
being finished by Christmas.</font>

10:12.627 --> 10:14.627
<font color="#FFFF00"> How did the work get so far behind?</font>

10:14.628 --> 10:17.626
Well, he's just waiting on
an essential part,

10:17.627 --> 10:19.627
a seven gauge
retractable pinion bracket.

10:21.162 --> 10:22.626
<font color="#FFFF00"> There's no such thing.</font>

10:22.627 --> 10:24.294
I know!

10:24.295 --> 10:25.626
<font color="#FFFF00"> Where is this builder, anyway?</font>

10:25.627 --> 10:28.027
<font color="#FFFF00"> He's at lunch. </font>It's 4pm!</font>

10:28.028 --> 10:31.294
Yeah, but, to be fair,
he didn't start till midday.

10:31.295 --> 10:33.626
<font color="#FFFF00"> This is appalling, Lee.
Look at the state of this place!</font>

10:33.627 --> 10:35.626
<font color="#FFFF00"> He's walked dirty boots
all over the rug.</font>

10:35.627 --> 10:39.626
<font color="#FFFF00"> Well, we haven't got a doormat.</font>
Well, that's a matter of opinion.</font>

10:39.627 --> 10:41.626
Look, I know she's your friend

10:41.627 --> 10:44.627
and you've only got her interests
at heart, but don't tell Lucy.

10:45.627 --> 10:47.626
Please.

10:47.627 --> 10:48.627
<font color="#FFFF00"> On one condition -</font>

10:48.628 --> 10:51.760
<font color="#FFFF00"> the moment this man gets back,
you give him a firm dressing down.</font>

10:51.761 --> 10:53.894
<font color="#FFFF00"> Get a written, detailed schedule
of each job</font>

10:53.895 --> 10:56.626
<font color="#FFFF00"> and when he's going to do it,
and then stand over him</font>

10:56.627 --> 10:57.627
<font color="#FFFF00"> and watch him while he does it.</font>

10:57.628 --> 11:00.627
It's the only way it'll get done
by Friday. <span tts: color="white <font color="#FFFF00"> Good idea. </font>Good.</font>

11:00.628 --> 11:02.626
Can you tell him that for me?

11:02.627 --> 11:05.626
<font color="#FFFF00"> What? </font>Well, you're so much better
at this sort of thing than me.

11:05.627 --> 11:07.626
<font color="#FFFF00"> He won't listen to me.</font>

11:07.627 --> 11:10.626
<font color="#FFFF00"> You and Lucy employed him,
it's not my kitchen. </font>You're right.

11:10.627 --> 11:13.027
So tell him it is your kitchen.

11:13.028 --> 11:14.627
He's never met Lucy.

11:17.627 --> 11:19.626
<font color="#FFFF00"> But that would make me your...</font>

11:19.627 --> 11:20.627
<font color="#FFFF00"> Oh.</font>

11:21.627 --> 11:24.626
<font color="#00FFFF"> All right. </font>Hello, Dave, mate!

11:24.627 --> 11:26.627
This is my wife, Lucy.

11:27.628 --> 11:31.626
<font color="#00FFFF"> Oh, hello. He's told me
a lot about you, love.</font>

11:31.627 --> 11:33.627
<font color="#00FFFF"> Yeah, she's exactly
as you described.</font>

11:35.627 --> 11:36.760
<font color="#00FFFF"> Anyway, um, back in a mo,</font>

11:36.761 --> 11:39.627
<font color="#00FFFF"> I'm just popping to the caff
to use the facilities.</font>

11:41.028 --> 11:42.626
<font color="#FFFF00"> Uh, excuse me.</font>

11:42.627 --> 11:45.626
<font color="#FFFF00"> After the lunch break you just took,
you actually have the cheek</font>

11:45.627 --> 11:47.626
<font color="#FFFF00"> to turn round
and walk straight back out again?</font>

11:47.627 --> 11:49.626
<font color="#00FFFF"> If you've got to go,
you've got to go, love.</font>

11:49.627 --> 11:51.028
<font color="#FFFF00"> My name's not "love", it's...</font>

11:52.627 --> 11:53.627
<font color="#FFFF00"> ..Lucy.</font>

11:53.628 --> 11:57.626
Yes! This is Lucy,
which I've already said.

11:57.627 --> 11:59.626
<font color="#00FFFF"> Hello, Lucy. Nice to meet you.
I'm Dave.</font>

11:59.627 --> 12:00.627
<font color="#FFFF00"> Dave what?</font>

12:00.628 --> 12:02.627
<font color="#00FFFF"> Dave, Miss.</font>

12:05.429 --> 12:06.760
<font color="#FFFF00"> I meant what's your surname?</font>

12:06.761 --> 12:09.626
<font color="#00FFFF"> <font color="#FFFF00"> Uh, Stockton. </font>Right.</font>

12:09.627 --> 12:12.561
<font color="#FFFF00"> Mr Stockton,
let's start again, shall we?</font>

12:12.562 --> 12:15.161
<font color="#FFFF00"> Let's act more like this is
a professional environment,</font>

12:15.162 --> 12:17.027
<font color="#FFFF00"> where services are exchanged
for money,</font>

12:17.028 --> 12:20.294
<font color="#FFFF00"> and less like we're betting
on the outcome of a cockfight</font>

12:20.295 --> 12:21.626
<font color="#FFFF00"> at The Dog and Duck.</font>

12:21.627 --> 12:24.626
<font color="#00FFFF"> <font color="#FFFF00"> How do you mean? </font>You're going back
to work right now, Mr Stockton,</font>

12:24.627 --> 12:26.626
<font color="#FFFF00"> and I'm drawing up an exact schedule</font>

12:26.627 --> 12:28.894
<font color="#FFFF00"> that gives us a fighting chance
of getting this done by Friday.</font>

12:28.895 --> 12:30.894
<font color="#FFFF00"> <font color="#00FFFF"> Understand? </font>Yeah.</font>

12:30.895 --> 12:32.626
<font color="#FFFF00"> Well, what are you waiting for?</font>

12:32.627 --> 12:35.626
<font color="#FFFF00"> A starting pistol or Godot?</font>

12:35.627 --> 12:37.626
<font color="#00FFFF"> Right, I'll crack on, yeah.</font>

12:37.627 --> 12:40.626
<font color="#FFFF00"> And you can smarten yourself up,
for God's sake.</font>

12:40.627 --> 12:42.626
<font color="#FFFF00"> Just because you're living on
a building site</font>

12:42.627 --> 12:45.626
<font color="#FFFF00"> doesn't mean
you need to dress like a labourer.</font>

12:45.627 --> 12:47.626
Yes, darling.

12:47.627 --> 12:48.627
<font color="#FFFF00"> Not the lips.</font>

12:51.628 --> 12:53.626
You're very good at this.

12:53.627 --> 12:56.627
<font color="#FFFF00"> I once made a builder cry so much
he had to relay the damp course.</font>

12:59.627 --> 13:01.295
<font color="#11FF11"> Anna?</font>

13:03.627 --> 13:05.428
No. Lucy.

13:05.429 --> 13:09.626
Me and Anna split up years ago,
so now I'm married to Lucy.

13:09.627 --> 13:13.028
Dave, this is someone
I haven't seen for years.

13:14.162 --> 13:16.626
<font color="#FFFF00"> Why don't you two go
and have a coffee and catch up</font>

13:16.627 --> 13:17.627
<font color="#FFFF00"> on all those lost years.</font>

13:17.628 --> 13:21.627
<font color="#FFFF00"> I'll be right here, won't I,
Mr Stockton?</font>

13:22.627 --> 13:25.627
<font color="#00FFFF"> See you later. </font>Please don't be long.</font>

13:30.627 --> 13:32.626
<font color="#FFFF00"> I don't know what signals
we've been giving off</font>

13:32.627 --> 13:34.626
<font color="#FFFF00"> but, as I assured you at the time,</font>

13:34.627 --> 13:36.627
<font color="#FFFF00"> I dropped our car keys in that bowl
by accident.</font>

13:39.295 --> 13:41.626
Look, I was under a lot of pressure
and I just snapped

13:41.627 --> 13:43.626
and asked Anna to be my wife.

13:43.627 --> 13:46.028
<font color="#FFFF00"> That's actually the same
as my story.</font>

13:48.627 --> 13:51.162
<font color="#FFFF00"> I didn't realise she was going to be
so frightening. </font>Ditto.</font>

13:52.562 --> 13:55.626
<font color="#FFFF00"> I can't believe she agreed
to pretend to be Lucy,</font>

13:55.627 --> 13:57.761
<font color="#FFFF00"> and yet when I ask her to be
Susie Dent...</font>

14:00.895 --> 14:03.626
I tell you what, she's very good
at this confrontation thing,

14:03.627 --> 14:04.627
<font color="#FFFF00"> isn't she? </font>Yeah.</font>

14:04.628 --> 14:07.626
<font color="#FFFF00"> I've always wanted to send her
to the Middle East.</font>

14:07.627 --> 14:08.760
<font color="#FFFF00"> Not to resolve the conflicts,</font>

14:08.761 --> 14:11.626
<font color="#FFFF00"> I've just always wanted to send her
to the Middle East.</font>

14:11.627 --> 14:15.626
<font color="#FFFF00"> She's done me a massive favour,
you know. </font>You've done her a favour.</font>

14:15.627 --> 14:17.561
<font color="#FFFF00"> She loves being the boss -</font>

14:17.562 --> 14:18.626
<font color="#FFFF00"> hiring and firing,</font>

14:18.627 --> 14:21.626
<font color="#FFFF00"> holding innocent people's lives
in her hands.</font>

14:21.627 --> 14:23.626
<font color="#FFFF00"> Firing? </font>Yeah, that's what she does.</font>

14:23.627 --> 14:25.626
<font color="#FFFF00"> Well, it's certainly
what she did with ours.</font>

14:25.627 --> 14:27.626
But I thought you were delighted
with your builders.

14:27.627 --> 14:28.627
<font color="#FFFF00"> Well, the final ones, yeah,</font>

14:28.628 --> 14:30.760
<font color="#FFFF00"> but she went through loads
before she was happy.</font>

14:30.761 --> 14:32.760
<font color="#FFFF00"> Kitchen fitter after kitchen fitter</font>

14:32.761 --> 14:34.894
<font color="#FFFF00"> until there was only one
left standing.</font>

14:34.895 --> 14:36.626
<font color="#FFFF00"> It was a Darwinian struggle.</font>

14:36.627 --> 14:38.627
<font color="#FFFF00"> Survival of the fitters.</font>

14:40.895 --> 14:43.626
Yeah, but she won't sack Dave,

14:43.627 --> 14:45.626
she knows it needs to be done
by Friday.

14:45.627 --> 14:48.428
<font color="#FFFF00"> Yeah, but you never know with Anna,</font>

14:48.429 --> 14:50.626
<font color="#FFFF00"> when that red fog descends...</font>

14:50.627 --> 14:52.027
I think the phrase is "red mist".

14:52.028 --> 14:54.161
<font color="#FFFF00"> No, the mist is there permanently,</font>

14:54.162 --> 14:56.628
<font color="#FFFF00"> it's the fog and icy conditions
you need to watch out for.</font>

14:58.627 --> 15:00.626
She can't sack Dave
and she needs to be told.

15:00.627 --> 15:03.627
<font color="#FFFF00"> Don't look at me, she's your wife.</font>

15:12.028 --> 15:16.626
<font color="#FFFF00"> Where's Dave? </font>Yeah, he's a big lad,
what have you done with the body?</font>

15:16.627 --> 15:19.626
<font color="#00FFFF"> He's gone to get a tool
from his van. </font>Right.

15:19.627 --> 15:21.626
<font color="#00FFFF"> I do allow people to pop out
if necessary.</font>

15:21.627 --> 15:23.294
<font color="#00FFFF"> I'm not a complete tyrant.</font>

15:23.295 --> 15:25.627
<font color="#11FF11"> DAVE PANTS</font>
Did I make it?</font>

15:28.761 --> 15:30.627
<font color="#00FFFF"> With six seconds to spare.</font>

15:32.627 --> 15:34.162
<font color="#11FF11"> I can't handle this.</font>

15:37.627 --> 15:39.626
Well done, he's certainly
pulling his finger out.

15:39.627 --> 15:41.626
<font color="#00FFFF"> I'm not surprised -
I gave him his final warning.</font>

15:41.627 --> 15:43.760
And then what? The naughty step?

15:43.761 --> 15:46.627
<font color="#FFFF00"> In my experience,
it's more like The Hurt Locker.</font>

15:47.627 --> 15:50.626
<font color="#00FFFF"> I just find people work better
when their job's being threatened,</font>

15:50.627 --> 15:53.561
<font color="#00FFFF"> it's why I always mutter
about the divorce lawyer</font>

15:53.562 --> 15:55.562
<font color="#00FFFF"> whenever Toby's late
putting the bins out.</font>

15:56.627 --> 15:58.760
Can I just say, Anna,
thanks for everything,

15:58.761 --> 16:01.161
but I reckon I can take it
from here.

16:01.162 --> 16:03.428
<font color="#00FFFF"> I'm sorry?</font>
Well, you've been so amazing,

16:03.429 --> 16:05.626
I don't think you need to be
my wife any more.

16:05.627 --> 16:08.627
<font color="#00FFFF">You can't get rid of me that easily.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00"> You can't, I've looked into it.</font>

16:10.627 --> 16:13.626
<font color="#00FFFF"> The moment I leave, that man
will fall back into his old habits</font>

16:13.627 --> 16:16.626
<font color="#00FFFF"> and Lucy will come home
and find her house in total chaos.</font>

16:16.627 --> 16:18.627
<font color="#00FFFF"> Why don't you two run along again?</font>

16:18.628 --> 16:20.626
<font color="#00FFFF"> Leave this to the grown-ups.</font>

16:20.627 --> 16:22.626
Actually, why don't we stick around

16:22.627 --> 16:24.626
and we'll all three of us
project manage it together?

16:24.627 --> 16:29.626
<font color="#00FFFF"> What? Good cop, bad cop,
and not-much cop?</font>

16:29.627 --> 16:31.561
<font color="#FFFF00"> Can't I be Robocop?</font>

16:31.562 --> 16:34.627
<font color="#FFFF00"> Then I'd have guns for arms
and I could blow my own brains out.</font>

16:35.627 --> 16:37.627
I'll go and check on him.

16:38.627 --> 16:41.294
<font color="#11FF11"> DAVE GASPS</font>
Oh, I thought you were her.</font>

16:41.295 --> 16:44.626
No, you'll know when it's her,
the birds stop singing.

16:44.627 --> 16:47.294
<font color="#11FF11"> Since you went out,
she chucked my radio in the bin</font>

16:47.295 --> 16:49.428
<font color="#11FF11"> and threaten to dock my pay
if I whistle.</font>

16:49.429 --> 16:51.626
Look, don't take it personally.

16:51.627 --> 16:53.561
She's a pussycat, really.

16:53.562 --> 16:55.626
All right, a tiger.

16:55.627 --> 16:57.627
All right, a sabre-toothed tiger.

17:00.028 --> 17:04.626
<font color="#00FFFF"> Are you really sanding those joints
with 40-grit sandpaper?</font>

17:04.627 --> 17:07.626
<font color="#00FFFF"> You're not fitting a kitchen
in a crack house!</font>

17:07.627 --> 17:09.626
<font color="#00FFFF"> And have you been sniffing
wood vanish?</font>

17:09.627 --> 17:11.626
<font color="#00FFFF"> Because you must be high
on something if you think</font>

17:11.627 --> 17:13.161
<font color="#00FFFF"> those units are sitting flush
together.</font>

17:13.162 --> 17:14.626
<font color="#00FFFF"> I could drive a pig
through that gap.</font>

17:14.627 --> 17:16.627
<font color="#00FFFF"> Right, that's it.</font>
You can't sack him.

17:16.627 --> 17:18.626
<font color="#11FF11"> That's right, she can't. </font>See.

17:18.627 --> 17:20.626
<font color="#11FF11"> Cos I quit.</font>

17:20.627 --> 17:23.626
Wait! You can't leave now,
otherwise I won't pay you.

17:23.627 --> 17:25.760
<font color="#11FF11"> Oh, yes, you will.</font>
You're right, I will.

17:25.761 --> 17:27.626
<font color="#11FF11"> I'll collect my stuff soon,</font>

17:27.627 --> 17:29.627
<font color="#11FF11"> in the daylight when she's asleep.</font>

17:31.627 --> 17:34.561
<font color="#00FFFF"> Well, I think my work here is done.</font>

17:34.562 --> 17:36.428
<font color="#00FFFF"> Best not to mention this to Lucy,</font>

17:36.429 --> 17:38.626
<font color="#00FFFF"> I don't want her to think
I was meddling.</font>

17:38.627 --> 17:41.294
<font color="#FFFF00"> Yes, and hopefully Anna's learnt
a valuable lesson today</font>

17:41.295 --> 17:42.894
<font color="#FFFF00"> about respecting people's feelings.</font>

17:42.895 --> 17:44.761
<font color="#00FFFF"> Oh, shut up and die, Toby.</font>

17:46.627 --> 17:47.627
<font color="#FFFF00"> Or maybe not.</font>

17:49.028 --> 17:51.626
PHONE RINGS

17:51.627 --> 17:53.626
<font color="#FFFF00"> It's Lucy. </font>Which one?</font>

17:53.627 --> 17:55.626
The real one.

17:55.627 --> 17:58.760
<font color="#FFFF00"> Well, seeing as you've done nothing
but avoid confrontation,</font>

17:58.761 --> 18:01.626
<font color="#FFFF00"> maybe it's time you confronted
the truth.</font>

18:01.627 --> 18:04.294
<font color="#FFFF00"> Which is what? </font>You're a pillock.</font>

18:04.295 --> 18:06.626
<font color="#FFFF00"> At some point in your life,
you're going to have to accept</font>

18:06.627 --> 18:09.161
<font color="#FFFF00"> that a certain level of conflict
is inevitable.</font>

18:09.162 --> 18:10.626
You're right.

18:10.627 --> 18:12.626
You should definitely tell her that.

18:12.627 --> 18:13.627
<font color="#FFFF00"> Answer it.</font>

18:13.628 --> 18:15.626
LEE SIGHS

18:15.627 --> 18:17.626
<font color="#00FFFF"> Hi, Lucy. </font>Hi.</font>

18:17.627 --> 18:20.626
Having fun at your mum and dad's?
<font color="#00FFFF"> No. </font>Are you sure?

18:20.627 --> 18:23.428
Because I was thinking if you wanted
to stay on for a bit

18:23.429 --> 18:24.760
and make it into a
bit of a sabbatical...

18:24.761 --> 18:26.627
<font color="#00FFFF"> What's happened? </font>Nothing's happened.

18:26.628 --> 18:29.294
Well, very little anyway.

18:29.295 --> 18:31.626
<font color="#00FFFF"> Let me speak to this builder
right now.</font>

18:31.627 --> 18:33.626
Um, you can't, he's up the ladder.

18:33.627 --> 18:36.626
<font color="#00FFFF"> In the kitchen? Put him on now.</font>

18:36.627 --> 18:37.627
OK.

18:40.295 --> 18:41.627
I'm just fetching him now.

18:42.628 --> 18:44.626
<font color="#00FFFF"> With all due respect to Toby,</font>

18:44.627 --> 18:46.627
<font color="#00FFFF"> he's not going to pull this off
on FaceTime.</font>

18:49.627 --> 18:51.627
Oh, hi, Lucy. You look nice.

18:51.628 --> 18:53.626
<font color="#00FFFF"> Where's Dave?</font>

18:53.627 --> 18:55.428
All right.

18:55.429 --> 18:57.626
The absolute truth?

18:57.627 --> 19:00.626
<font color="#00FFFF"> He's gone. </font>Gone? Where?</font>

19:00.627 --> 19:03.626
To go and get more builders
to help him finish the job.

19:03.627 --> 19:04.627
<font color="#00FFFF"> What?</font>

19:04.628 --> 19:06.626
I was not happy about the pace
he was going

19:06.627 --> 19:08.294
so I tore right into him.

19:08.295 --> 19:10.626
I said, "No more shilly-shallying
from you, good man."

19:10.627 --> 19:12.626
It's the only language
these people understand.

19:12.627 --> 19:14.627
<font color="#00FFFF"> What, 18th century English?</font>

19:16.028 --> 19:18.626
<font color="#00FFFF"> Well, well done for confronting him.</font>

19:18.627 --> 19:21.626
<font color="#00FFFF"> So it'll be definitely finished
when I get back, then?</font>

19:21.627 --> 19:23.294
<font color="#00FFFF"> Yep. </font>Promise?</font>

19:23.295 --> 19:25.760
Absolutely. We're almost done.

19:25.761 --> 19:28.626
<font color="#00FFFF"> Well, show me, then.</font>

19:28.627 --> 19:31.626
<font color="#00FFFF"> What? </font>Can I see the kitchen?</font>

19:31.627 --> 19:33.626
Yeah.

19:33.627 --> 19:37.161
I'll give you a quick guided tour.

19:37.162 --> 19:39.626
Yeah, it's looking...

19:39.627 --> 19:41.295
<font color="#00FFFF"> Hello?</font>

19:45.627 --> 19:48.626
<font color="#00FFFF"> Lee? Oh, you've frozen. Lee?</font>

19:48.627 --> 19:51.626
I... Eh... Hm... Mm...

19:51.627 --> 19:53.626
<font color="#00FFFF"> No, you're breaking up.</font>

19:53.627 --> 19:55.626
<font color="#00FFFF"> Ugh! </font>Lee?</font>

19:55.627 --> 19:57.626
<font color="#00FFFF"> Oh, forget it.</font>

19:57.627 --> 19:58.627
<font color="#00FFFF"> Bye.</font>

20:00.627 --> 20:02.627
I think I got away with that.

20:06.627 --> 20:07.627
<font color="#FFFF00"> Yes.</font>

20:09.028 --> 20:10.626
<font color="#FFFF00"> Perfect.</font>

20:10.627 --> 20:12.626
<font color="#FFFF00"> All you need now is for
Rumpelstilts-kitchen to come round</font>

20:12.627 --> 20:16.161
<font color="#FFFF00"> and finish the job
and everything will be fine.</font>

20:16.162 --> 20:17.626
Unless...

20:17.627 --> 20:20.626
I finish the job myself.

20:20.627 --> 20:22.027
He's left all his tools.

20:22.028 --> 20:24.626
Look, T-junction, gut wrench,

20:24.627 --> 20:26.626
monkey nuts.

20:26.627 --> 20:29.428
All I need now is a spanner.

20:29.429 --> 20:31.626
<font color="#FFFF00"> I'm looking at one.</font>

20:31.627 --> 20:34.626
<font color="#FFFF00"> There's no way you can do this
on your own.</font>

20:34.627 --> 20:36.626
You're right.

20:36.627 --> 20:38.894
<font color="#FFFF00"> Oh, God.</font>

20:38.895 --> 20:40.760
<font color="#00FFFF"> # Our house</font>

20:40.761 --> 20:43.161
<font color="#00FFFF"> # In the middle of our street</font>

20:43.162 --> 20:45.294
<font color="#00FFFF"> # Our house</font>

20:45.295 --> 20:47.027
<font color="#00FFFF"> # In the middle of our</font>

20:47.028 --> 20:49.161
<font color="#00FFFF"> # Our house</font>

20:49.162 --> 20:50.626
<font color="#00FFFF"> # In the middle of our street</font>

20:50.627 --> 20:54.561
<font color="#11FF11"> # Something tells you that
you've got to move away from it</font>

20:54.562 --> 20:57.028
<font color="#00FFFF"> # Father gets up late for work</font>

20:58.627 --> 21:00.626
<font color="#00FFFF"> # Mother has to iron his shirt</font>

21:00.627 --> 21:02.626
<font color="#00FFFF"> # Then she sends the kids to school</font>

21:02.627 --> 21:06.626
<font color="#00FFFF"> # Sees them off with a small kiss</font>

21:06.627 --> 21:09.628
<font color="#00FFFF"> # She's the one they're going to
miss in lots of ways</font>

21:34.627 --> 21:36.626
<font color="#00FFFF"> # Our house</font>

21:36.627 --> 21:38.561
<font color="#00FFFF"> # In the middle of our street</font>

21:38.562 --> 21:40.626
<font color="#00FFFF"> # Our house</font>

21:40.627 --> 21:41.627
<font color="#00FFFF"> # In the middle of our</font>

21:41.628 --> 21:44.626
<font color="#00FFFF"> # I remember way back then
when everything was true and when</font>

21:44.627 --> 21:46.627
<font color="#00FFFF"> # We would have such a very good
time, such a fine time</font>

21:46.628 --> 21:49.626
<font color="#00FFFF"> # Such a happy time</font>

21:49.627 --> 21:51.626
<font color="#00FFFF"> # And I remember how we'd play,
simply waste the day away</font>

21:51.627 --> 21:54.760
<font color="#00FFFF"> # Then we'd say nothing
could come between us</font>

21:54.761 --> 21:56.627
<font color="#00FFFF"> # Two dreamers</font>

21:57.627 --> 21:59.627
<font color="#00FFFF"> # Father wears his Sunday best</font>

22:00.627 --> 22:02.894
<font color="#00FFFF"> # Mother's tired, she needs a rest</font>

22:02.895 --> 22:05.626
<font color="#00FFFF"> # The kids are playing up downstairs</font>

22:05.627 --> 22:08.760
<font color="#00FFFF"> # Sister's sighing in her sleep</font>

22:08.761 --> 22:10.627
<font color="#00FFFF"> # Brother's got... #</font>

22:16.028 --> 22:17.626
<font color="#FFFF00"> I'm home!</font>

22:17.627 --> 22:21.027
<font color="#FFFF00"> Don't worry,
I left the kids with Mum and Dad.</font>

22:21.028 --> 22:24.428
<font color="#FFFF00"> I want some peace and quiet
to enjoy my new kitchen!</font>

22:24.429 --> 22:27.027
Um, can you come back a bit later?
It's not quite ready.

22:27.028 --> 22:28.895
<font color="#FFFF00"> No, I can't wait any longer.</font>

22:30.028 --> 22:31.894
<font color="#FFFF00"> Should I close my eyes?</font>

22:31.895 --> 22:33.627
Yeah, that's probably a good idea.

22:42.627 --> 22:44.027
I wish you'd give me another
five minutes

22:44.028 --> 22:46.027
I wanted to iron the tea towels.

22:46.028 --> 22:47.626
<font color="#FFFF00"> Oh, my God, Lee!</font>

22:47.627 --> 22:50.027
<font color="#FFFF00"> He's done it brilliantly!</font>

22:50.028 --> 22:51.627
<font color="#FFFF00"> Oh, I love him!</font>

22:55.627 --> 22:57.626
Toby was just passing.

22:57.627 --> 22:59.626
Samaritans don't open till ten.

22:59.627 --> 23:01.428
<font color="#FFFF00"> Oh, it looks amazing!</font>

23:01.429 --> 23:02.627
<font color="#FFFF00"> Oh, well done.</font>

23:03.628 --> 23:06.626
<font color="#FFFF00"> Oh, I didn't think
he'd have it finished on time.</font>

23:06.627 --> 23:08.894
Well, you should have more faith
in your project manager.

23:08.895 --> 23:12.626
Once I tell someone to do something,
they are like putty in my hands.

23:12.627 --> 23:14.626
<font color="#00FFFF"> That's not putty, that's play-doh.</font>

23:14.627 --> 23:16.627
Is it?

23:22.627 --> 23:25.627
Don't worry,
I'll just get a dustpan.

23:27.761 --> 23:29.626
Ooh.

23:29.627 --> 23:31.626
I'll just...

23:31.627 --> 23:33.295
..pop that back on.

23:49.295 --> 23:52.162
At least the... the island's
nice and sturdy.

24:00.627 --> 24:03.628
We're just waiting on a seven gauge
retractable pinion bracket.

24:06.295 --> 24:07.626
<font color="#FFFF00"> Where's Dave?</font>

24:07.627 --> 24:10.626
That's what I want to know.
Bloody con man.

24:10.627 --> 24:13.626
He's probably done a runner,
so we'll never track him down now.

24:13.627 --> 24:14.628
<font color="#11FF11"> Morning!</font>

24:16.627 --> 24:19.428
<font color="#11FF11"> Don't mind me,
just come back for my gear.</font>

24:19.429 --> 24:21.626
<font color="#11FF11"> Hey, your wife isn't about, is she?</font>

24:21.627 --> 24:23.626
Actually, Dave.

24:23.627 --> 24:25.626
<font color="#FFFF00"> Oh.</font>

24:25.627 --> 24:28.626
<font color="#FFFF00">So you're the mysterious Dave?</font>
<font color="#11FF11"> That's right.</font>

24:28.627 --> 24:31.627
<font color="#FFFF00">What do you call this?</font>
<font color="#11FF11"> Call it pretty shocking.</font>

24:32.627 --> 24:34.626
<font color="#11FF11"> Screws missing,</font>

24:34.627 --> 24:37.626
<font color="#11FF11"> plasterboard harpoon fixing
in a brick wall.</font>

24:37.627 --> 24:39.626
Disgraceful.

24:39.627 --> 24:42.894
<font color="#11FF11"> That panel looks like
it's been stuck on with Pritt stick.</font>

24:42.895 --> 24:46.027
<font color="#00FFFF"> Told you it should have been
Blu-Tack.</font>

24:46.028 --> 24:47.627
<font color="#FFFF00"> Not even an apology?</font>

24:47.628 --> 24:49.626
<font color="#11FF11"> <font color="#FFFF00"> Who are you? </font>I'm Lucy.</font>

24:49.627 --> 24:51.626
<font color="#11FF11"> <font color="#FFFF00"> No, you're not. </font>Aren't I?</font>

24:51.627 --> 24:54.162
<font color="#FFFF00"> <font color="#11FF11"> Well, who is, then? </font>She is.</font>

24:56.627 --> 24:57.627
<font color="#FFFF00"> She's not Lucy.</font>

24:57.628 --> 24:59.627
<font color="#11FF11"> Well, then how come she's been
bossing me about</font>

24:59.628 --> 25:02.561
<font color="#11FF11"> to get this kitchen built?</font>

25:02.562 --> 25:03.760
I outsourced it.

25:03.761 --> 25:06.027
<font color="#FFFF00"> You got Anna to be the bad guy?</font>

25:06.028 --> 25:09.626
Sometimes you have to find
the best person for the job.

25:09.627 --> 25:12.626
<font color="#FFFF00"> Shame you didn't think about that
when you hired Wreck-It Ralph.</font>

25:12.627 --> 25:15.626
<font color="#11FF11"> I didn't do it.
This has been done by cowboys.</font>

25:15.627 --> 25:16.627
<font color="#FFFF00"> Which cowboys?</font>

25:17.627 --> 25:19.627
Yee-ha.

25:20.627 --> 25:23.626
<font color="#00FFFF"> You see, this is what happens
when you can't do confrontation.</font>

25:23.627 --> 25:27.626
<font color="#FFFF00"> <font color="#11FF11"> Which he never can. </font>Yes, Lee, it's
ridiculous the way you've acted.</font>

25:27.627 --> 25:29.294
<font color="#11FF11"> You should have shown some backbone.</font>

25:29.295 --> 25:31.626
<font color="#00FFFF"> You can't spend your whole life
not standing up to people.</font>

25:31.627 --> 25:33.626
<font color="#11FF11"> <font color="#FFFF00"> Got a point. </font>You're pathetic.</font>

25:33.627 --> 25:37.626
Oh, why don't you all BLEEP off!

25:37.627 --> 25:38.627
It's not my fault.

25:38.628 --> 25:40.894
You should have stayed here
and dealt with things yourself

25:40.895 --> 25:43.626
instead of running off
to your mummy's like a little baby

25:43.627 --> 25:46.161
because you're too prissy to wee
in the back garden occasionally.

25:46.162 --> 25:48.760
You shouldn't have acted out
your crazed power-trip fantasies

25:48.761 --> 25:52.626
like some sort of two-bit suburban
dominatrix drill sergeant.

25:52.627 --> 25:54.894
You should have spent more time
working with those power tools

25:54.895 --> 25:57.626
instead of using them to scratch
your big fat arse crack.

25:57.627 --> 25:58.627
And you need to learn

25:58.628 --> 26:03.027
how to fit a six-unit Peninsula
kitchen properly, you useless twat.

26:03.028 --> 26:06.626
There! How's that for confrontation?

26:06.627 --> 26:09.626
Hm? Right, why don't you all
piss off out of my kitchen

26:09.627 --> 26:11.627
and let me sit down
and have a good cry?

26:15.627 --> 26:17.627
Actually, maybe that was a bit much.

26:19.028 --> 26:22.627
Why don't we sort this out
over a nice cup of tea?

26:32.627 --> 26:34.294
That's good.

26:34.295 --> 26:35.627
The water's back on.

26:39.562 --> 26:41.626
# We're not going out

26:41.627 --> 26:43.626
# Not staying in

26:43.627 --> 26:46.626
# Just hanging around
with my head in a spin

26:46.627 --> 26:49.626
# But there is no need
to scream and shout

26:49.627 --> 26:52.626
# We're not going out

26:52.627 --> 26:55.627
# We are not going out. #
