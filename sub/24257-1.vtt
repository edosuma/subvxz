00:46.318 --> 00:48.085
Welcome back to the program.

00:48.087 --> 00:50.088
If you're just tuning
in, I'm sitting here live

00:50.090 --> 00:52.890
with the sole survivor of
the Miles County Massacre,

00:52.892 --> 00:54.995
which occurred exactly one year
ago today.

00:55.928 --> 00:57.328
I've worked on this show for
many years

00:57.330 --> 00:58.963
and I've never sat across from
someone

00:58.965 --> 01:01.001
who has a story to tell quite
like yours.

01:02.035 --> 01:03.234
Thank you again for taking the
time

01:03.236 --> 01:04.902
to sit down and speak with me.

01:04.904 --> 01:06.272
It's my pleasure.

01:07.740 --> 01:09.074
Now when we left off we were
talking

01:09.076 --> 01:11.809
about the moment you
woke up from the coma.

01:11.811 --> 01:13.178
Do you remember your initial
reaction

01:13.180 --> 01:14.946
when you first saw your face?

01:14.948 --> 01:16.413
Yes.

01:16.415 --> 01:18.717
Would you like to share that
with us?

01:20.019 --> 01:21.121
I wished I was dead.

01:22.421 --> 01:24.823
Do you still feel that way?

01:24.825 --> 01:27.225
People are frightened
by the way that I look,

01:27.227 --> 01:28.329
especially children.

01:29.463 --> 01:32.863
And it's really difficult
for me to deal with that,

01:32.865 --> 01:34.300
so isolation is ideal.

01:36.936 --> 01:38.438
Now what about your attacker,

01:39.439 --> 01:42.806
a man identified only as Art the
Clown?

01:42.808 --> 01:46.276
There's a lot of controversy
surrounding his supposed death.

01:46.278 --> 01:47.511
The authorities issued
a statement claiming

01:47.513 --> 01:50.014
that his body disappeared from
the county coroner's office

01:50.016 --> 01:51.381
the morning after the attack.

01:51.383 --> 01:52.816
He's dead.

01:52.818 --> 01:54.384
I saw it happen.

03:21.407 --> 03:23.141
Did you watch it?

03:23.143 --> 03:25.409
Oh my God, I thought she
was going to attack me.

03:30.282 --> 03:32.219
My heart was pounding the entire
time.

03:33.587 --> 03:35.954
Yeah well, if you think she
looks that bad on television,

03:35.956 --> 03:39.157
imagine what she looks like
sitting two feet away from you.

03:39.159 --> 03:41.926
I thought I was going to gag at
one point.

03:41.928 --> 03:43.327
Babe, do me a favor.

03:43.329 --> 03:44.862
If I ever look like that,
promise me

03:44.864 --> 03:46.266
you'll put me out of my misery.

03:47.233 --> 03:48.533
You think I'm kidding?

03:48.535 --> 03:49.837
I'll do it myself.

03:51.370 --> 03:53.271
Yeah, Tom said we won't
know until the morning.

03:53.273 --> 03:55.339
But he thinks the ratings
are going to go up big time.

04:01.947 --> 04:03.647
Exactly.

04:03.649 --> 04:06.316
We've finally figured out
the formula for success,

04:06.318 --> 04:09.119
faceless victims and a host in
jeopardy.

04:09.956 --> 04:10.821
Yeah, watch next month, it's
going

04:10.823 --> 04:12.959
to be called Monica's House of
Horrors.

04:14.960 --> 04:15.659
Shit.

04:15.661 --> 04:16.493
Hey, can I call you back?

04:16.495 --> 04:19.197
I have like 50 people calling
me.

04:19.199 --> 04:20.197
Okay.

04:20.200 --> 04:21.599
Alright, love you too.

04:21.601 --> 04:22.469
Bye.

04:24.337 --> 04:25.206
Hello?

04:26.505 --> 04:28.005
Tom?

05:28.567 --> 05:30.368
I think I just twisted
my ankle.

05:30.370 --> 05:31.204
Dawn, really?

05:32.104 --> 05:33.503
Thanks a lot, by the way.

05:33.505 --> 05:34.638
For what?

05:34.640 --> 05:37.241
Promising you weren't
gonna get shit faced tonight.

05:37.243 --> 05:38.642
Guys kept buying me drinks.

05:38.644 --> 05:41.512
I can't help it if people
find me interesting.

05:41.514 --> 05:42.479
Yeah.

05:42.481 --> 05:45.082
Definitely your mind that they
were after.

05:45.084 --> 05:46.183
Who are you texting?

05:46.185 --> 05:47.185
None of your business.

05:47.187 --> 05:49.219
You gave that asshole
your number, didn't you?

05:49.221 --> 05:51.688
Oh my god, you're so jealous.

05:51.690 --> 05:52.690
Of what?

05:52.692 --> 05:54.092
That kid was talking to
like five other girls.

05:54.094 --> 05:55.426
Oh, stop being such a bitch.

05:55.428 --> 05:56.426
Just get in the car.

05:56.428 --> 05:58.462
Oh, you are not driving.

05:58.464 --> 05:59.731
I'm fine.

05:59.733 --> 06:01.065
Give me the keys.

06:01.067 --> 06:02.500
Give me the keys.

06:02.502 --> 06:04.368
Dawn, I don't feel like dying
tonight.

06:04.370 --> 06:05.270
Really?

06:05.272 --> 06:07.137
Are we really gonna do this
right now?

06:07.139 --> 06:09.140
Give me the keys.

06:09.142 --> 06:11.476
I'm gonna paw at you like a cat.

06:11.478 --> 06:12.342
Give me what I want.

06:12.344 --> 06:14.311
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

06:14.313 --> 06:16.046
You drive.

06:16.048 --> 06:19.416
Thank you.

06:25.425 --> 06:26.690
I'm fucking lit.

06:27.827 --> 06:30.628
But if I get something to
eat, I can drive us, okay?

06:30.630 --> 06:32.796
There's a place that's
open late, we can sober up.

06:32.798 --> 06:34.332
Did you say food?

06:34.334 --> 06:35.633
I said food.

06:35.635 --> 06:37.168
You know the place, it's
right there, come on.

06:37.170 --> 06:38.169
Okay, okay, okay.

06:38.171 --> 06:40.772
Just like give me one minute.

06:40.774 --> 06:42.140
Fuck me.

06:42.142 --> 06:44.111
Like one minute, for real.

06:49.449 --> 06:50.317
D.

06:53.385 --> 06:54.251
D.

06:54.253 --> 06:55.152
What?

06:55.154 --> 06:56.289
Look.

06:57.824 --> 06:59.123
Holy shit.

06:59.125 --> 07:00.157
Yeah, that's not funny.

07:00.159 --> 07:01.625
I'm about to scream.

07:01.627 --> 07:03.161
Hey, handsome.

07:03.163 --> 07:03.861
Dawn, cut it out.

07:03.863 --> 07:05.296
My friend wants your number.

07:05.298 --> 07:07.265
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

07:07.267 --> 07:08.132
Come buy us dinner.

07:08.134 --> 07:08.799
Stop.

07:08.801 --> 07:10.267
Just shut the fuck up.

07:10.269 --> 07:10.902
Or what?

07:10.904 --> 07:12.803
Maybe he'll drive us home.

07:12.805 --> 07:14.575
I'm sorry, she's drunk.

07:23.283 --> 07:24.515
Let's go.

07:24.517 --> 07:25.416
Come on.

07:25.418 --> 07:27.085
Let's just go.

07:33.293 --> 07:34.157
Oh yeah?

07:34.159 --> 07:35.128
You get dressed up?

07:36.096 --> 07:37.794
Oh, you're a sick fuck.

07:37.796 --> 07:38.695
Where am I gonna go?

07:38.697 --> 07:40.130
Back to my wife?

07:40.132 --> 07:40.800
Same shit.

07:41.868 --> 07:43.734
Maybe another two hours?

07:43.736 --> 07:44.835
Alright.

07:44.837 --> 07:46.105
Alright, bye.

07:53.413 --> 07:54.712
Great.

07:56.683 --> 07:58.382
Ugh.

07:58.384 --> 08:02.520
That was the longest
piss I have ever taken.

08:02.522 --> 08:04.358
Thank you for sharing that.

08:05.224 --> 08:08.392
This guy wants me to meet
him at his apartment right now.

08:08.394 --> 08:09.260
What a shocker.

08:09.262 --> 08:10.527
I told him I would.

08:10.529 --> 08:11.561
What?

08:11.563 --> 08:12.398
I'm kidding.

08:13.700 --> 08:15.832
I have a little more
self respect than that.

08:15.834 --> 08:17.537
If you only had a brain.

08:19.805 --> 08:22.205
I've been wanting to
use that one all night.

08:22.207 --> 08:23.808
Congratulations.

08:39.825 --> 08:41.260
Look it's your boyfriend.

08:42.461 --> 08:44.629
I told you this a week ago,
we'll go to your mother's.

08:44.631 --> 08:46.366
I don't know, six weeks from
now.

08:47.934 --> 08:49.502
I'll be right with you buddy.

08:50.435 --> 08:51.601
You gotta see the shape of this
fuckin'

08:51.603 --> 08:52.772
guy that just walked in.

09:20.967 --> 09:22.236
Are you okay?

09:28.273 --> 09:30.607
I think we should get our food
to go.

09:30.609 --> 09:31.445
Why?

09:35.281 --> 09:36.150
Him?

09:36.916 --> 09:38.417
Seriously, I wanna leave.

09:39.752 --> 09:40.820
Jesus Christ.

09:42.354 --> 09:43.221
D, stop.

09:43.223 --> 09:44.157
Uh, excuse me?

09:45.224 --> 09:45.923
Excuse me?

09:45.925 --> 09:47.692
Can I get a picture with you?

09:47.694 --> 09:48.558
Dawn, come on.

09:48.560 --> 09:49.396
Shut up.

09:51.598 --> 09:52.466
Hello?

09:54.968 --> 09:55.836
Hello?

09:57.670 --> 09:58.369
Okay.

09:58.371 --> 10:00.841
I'm gonna take that as a yes.

10:04.911 --> 10:06.409
Oh.

10:06.411 --> 10:07.812
Oh.

10:07.814 --> 10:08.714
Sorry.

10:26.833 --> 10:27.733
Thanks.

10:30.902 --> 10:32.569
What the hell is wrong with
you?

10:32.571 --> 10:33.438
What?

10:33.440 --> 10:34.138
Did you think he was gonna hack
me up

10:34.140 --> 10:35.242
into little pieces or something?

10:37.574 --> 10:37.945
What can I get for you buddy?

10:40.046 --> 10:40.914
Hey?

10:41.848 --> 10:42.782
Hello?

10:45.852 --> 10:48.722
If you don't order anything,
you're gonna have to leave.

10:49.988 --> 10:52.358
You already have eight likes.

10:54.560 --> 10:56.229
Can you hear me in there?

10:57.897 --> 11:00.834
Oh god, it's gonna be a long
night.

11:34.099 --> 11:34.935
Aww.

11:41.807 --> 11:42.775
What are you doing?

11:48.680 --> 11:49.549
Thanks.

11:57.422 --> 11:59.923
Okay, not for nothing,
but that's the nicest thing

11:59.925 --> 12:02.058
a guy's done for you all night.

12:02.060 --> 12:03.593
Seriously?

12:03.595 --> 12:04.562
What the fuck?

12:04.564 --> 12:05.666
Here you go ladies.

12:07.599 --> 12:08.466
Yes.

12:08.468 --> 12:09.667
You two okay?

12:09.669 --> 12:10.771
Oh, he's harmless.

12:11.704 --> 12:12.572
You okay?

12:13.873 --> 12:15.573
Don't worry, I'll take care of
him.

12:15.575 --> 12:16.509
Enjoy your pizza.

12:31.858 --> 12:34.891
What do you keep staring at?

12:34.893 --> 12:36.059
That bag.

12:36.061 --> 12:37.563
What do you think is in it?

12:39.931 --> 12:41.131
I don't know, who cares?

12:41.133 --> 12:42.101
Just eat your food.

12:45.637 --> 12:47.704
You fuckin' freak!

12:47.706 --> 12:48.405
Get over here.

12:48.407 --> 12:50.875
All night with you, you fuck.

12:50.877 --> 12:51.777
Enough.

12:55.448 --> 12:57.114
Get outta here.

13:01.186 --> 13:04.390
Take your shit, and don't come
back.

13:08.994 --> 13:10.760
Ramon, grab a mob and some
bleach.

13:10.762 --> 13:11.629
Eh, you okay?

13:11.631 --> 13:12.866
Yeah, I'm alright.

13:27.446 --> 13:29.513
What do you think
that guy did in there?

13:29.515 --> 13:30.847
Who knows.

13:30.849 --> 13:32.716
Probably jizzed
all over the place,

13:32.718 --> 13:33.683
fucking pervert.

13:33.685 --> 13:35.586
Stop.

13:35.588 --> 13:36.721
What?

13:36.723 --> 13:38.555
I'm telling you that guy
totally whacked off in there.

13:38.557 --> 13:40.624
He was obviously turned on by
you.

13:40.626 --> 13:41.925
You're fuckin' sick.

13:41.927 --> 13:42.828
You know that?

13:45.730 --> 13:46.664
What?

13:46.666 --> 13:50.167
- Look at your hand.
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

13:50.169 --> 13:51.802
Look, at least he had the
courtesy to do

13:51.804 --> 13:52.903
whatever he did in private.

13:52.905 --> 13:56.606
I mean, he could have
whipped it out right there.

13:56.608 --> 13:58.545
I really don't need the
visual.

14:01.147 --> 14:03.047
Well are you okay to
drive?

14:03.049 --> 14:05.752
Yeah, trust me, that
sobered me right the fuck up.

14:06.886 --> 14:08.251
- Oh my god.
- What?

14:08.253 --> 14:09.122
Your tire.

14:10.022 --> 14:11.056
Fuck me.

14:12.157 --> 14:14.558
Has it been like this the whole
time?

14:14.560 --> 14:15.893
I think I would have said
something if I'd noticed

14:15.895 --> 14:17.760
that your tire had exploded.

14:17.762 --> 14:20.130
Why does this shit always
happen to me?

14:20.132 --> 14:21.635
Do you have a spare?

14:22.767 --> 14:23.803
It's on the car.

14:24.903 --> 14:25.805
Wow.

14:27.640 --> 14:29.939
I'm starting to feel sick.

14:29.941 --> 14:32.108
Just, give me your phone.

14:32.110 --> 14:33.112
I'll call my sister.

14:37.617 --> 14:39.750
Yo Steve, this is sick.

14:39.752 --> 14:42.285
I better get overtime for this.

14:42.287 --> 14:44.188
No joke, this is disgusting.

14:44.190 --> 14:46.055
You got me cleanin' piss
and shit at one o'clock

14:46.057 --> 14:47.757
in the morning.

14:47.759 --> 14:49.226
Let the guy who handles
food take care of it,

14:49.228 --> 14:50.897
real fuckin' sanitary.

14:51.897 --> 14:54.166
Steve, time and a half, or I'm
out.

14:56.835 --> 14:57.671
You hear me?

15:08.613 --> 15:09.313
Hello?

15:09.315 --> 15:10.550
Hi, it's me.

15:11.850 --> 15:12.816
Tara?

15:12.818 --> 15:13.983
Yeah, my phone died.

15:13.985 --> 15:15.885
I'm calling from Dawn's.

15:15.887 --> 15:16.754
Ah.

15:16.756 --> 15:17.789
Your phone died.

15:17.791 --> 15:19.023
Can you ever go out
without using social media

15:19.025 --> 15:20.924
every 30 seconds?

15:20.926 --> 15:22.659
I think you're the only one in
America

15:22.661 --> 15:24.260
who has that sort of restraint.

15:24.262 --> 15:25.996
Yeah, that's probably right.

15:25.998 --> 15:27.231
Did I wake you?

15:27.233 --> 15:30.634
No, I am studying for
my midterm tomorrow.

15:30.636 --> 15:31.901
Oh, shit.

15:31.903 --> 15:36.008
Why, what is it?

15:36.709 --> 15:37.975
What is it, Tara?

15:37.977 --> 15:40.177
Dawn and I are sort
of stranded right now.

15:40.179 --> 15:41.978
She has a flat tire and no spare

15:41.980 --> 15:44.617
and I was kind of hoping
you could pick us up?

15:45.984 --> 15:48.651
I have to be up in five hours,
Tara.

15:48.653 --> 15:49.687
Yeah, I know Vic.

15:49.689 --> 15:51.121
Don't bother, seriously.

15:51.123 --> 15:52.825
I didn't realize you had a test.

15:58.164 --> 15:59.032
Sorry.

16:00.333 --> 16:02.836
I didn't know you were here.

16:10.810 --> 16:11.808
You know what?

16:11.810 --> 16:13.776
I gotta stretch my legs
and besides, if I fail,

16:13.778 --> 16:15.245
I can always blame you.

16:15.247 --> 16:17.751
You are the best sister in the
world.

16:19.919 --> 16:20.787
Yeah.

16:22.854 --> 16:23.723
Where are you?

16:35.935 --> 16:36.969
What's wrong?

16:38.771 --> 16:39.837
I'm fine.

16:39.839 --> 16:41.105
Why?

16:41.107 --> 16:44.243
You keep looking over your
shoulder.

16:45.310 --> 16:47.211
Just thinking.

16:47.213 --> 16:48.048
About?

16:49.415 --> 16:50.250
Nothing.

16:51.316 --> 16:52.185
Tell me.

16:55.220 --> 16:57.222
What if that guy did this to
your car?

16:58.657 --> 16:59.289
What guy?

16:59.291 --> 17:00.189
The clown?

17:00.191 --> 17:01.226
I'm serious.

17:03.061 --> 17:05.998
Well, you really think
someone slashed my tires?

17:06.931 --> 17:09.666
Well, he knows this is your
car.

17:09.669 --> 17:11.435
He saw us getting into it
earlier.

17:11.436 --> 17:13.036
That's fucking ridiculous.

17:13.038 --> 17:15.741
I probably just ran over
a nail or something.

17:17.809 --> 17:19.042
I should have just let you
drive.

17:19.045 --> 17:22.079
Yeah, you should have.

17:22.080 --> 17:25.114
But as usual, you have
to be the good Samaritan

17:25.116 --> 17:26.215
so here we are.

17:26.218 --> 17:27.284
Stuck.

17:27.286 --> 17:29.154
Like a couple of assholes.

17:42.701 --> 17:43.369
Steve!

18:04.422 --> 18:05.290
Oh fuck!

18:14.834 --> 18:15.799
Help!

18:15.801 --> 18:19.969
Somebody!

18:35.121 --> 18:38.155
Yeah, but what if I'm right,

18:38.157 --> 18:40.990
and he's out there watching us
right now?

18:42.228 --> 18:44.393
Show him your tits.

18:44.395 --> 18:46.429
I don't know, Tara.

18:46.431 --> 18:48.465
Look, that guy was harmless.

18:48.467 --> 18:51.935
He's just some douchebag in a
costume

18:51.937 --> 18:54.905
acting like a retard
because it's Halloween.

18:59.178 --> 19:00.177
No.

19:00.179 --> 19:01.147
He was different.

19:04.350 --> 19:05.416
He smiled.

19:05.418 --> 19:08.151
The way he kept staring at
us with those dead eyes.

19:10.922 --> 19:12.357
What was in that bag?

19:16.094 --> 19:17.794
I don't know, Tara.

19:17.796 --> 19:19.963
The point is, he's gone,

19:19.965 --> 19:21.465
and you're never gonna see him
again.

19:21.467 --> 19:25.805
So cut the shit, 'cause you're
starting to freak me out.

19:41.319 --> 19:42.986
I really have to pee.

19:42.988 --> 19:43.957
So go.

19:44.923 --> 19:46.290
Go?

19:46.292 --> 19:46.990
Go where?

19:46.992 --> 19:48.159
It's the middle of the night.

19:48.161 --> 19:50.928
I can't just pop a squat
in the middle of the street

19:50.930 --> 19:51.996
and pee like you do.

19:51.998 --> 19:54.264
Well tough shit, because
it's gonna be a while

19:54.266 --> 19:56.466
before your sister gets here.

19:56.468 --> 19:57.336
Fuck.

20:09.414 --> 20:12.114
Maybe that guy has a
bathroom that you can use.

20:12.116 --> 20:13.316
Who?

20:13.318 --> 20:15.953
That creepy guy who just got
out of that

20:15.955 --> 20:17.991
even creepier looking building.

20:19.525 --> 20:20.890
Tara.

20:20.892 --> 20:22.094
I was kidding.

20:23.328 --> 20:24.196
Excuse me?

20:25.396 --> 20:26.263
Yes?

20:26.265 --> 20:27.198
I'm sorry to bother you.

20:27.200 --> 20:29.432
Is there a bathroom in there I
could use?

20:29.434 --> 20:31.034
Sorry, I don't own the place.

20:31.036 --> 20:32.436
I'm not supposed to let anyone
in here.

20:32.438 --> 20:34.237
Please, mister, it's an
emergency.

20:34.239 --> 20:35.538
I'll be two seconds.

20:35.540 --> 20:37.975
Honestly, I could get
in a lot of trouble.

20:37.977 --> 20:39.142
Who's gonna know?

20:39.144 --> 20:41.978
Just let her use
the bathroom, for god sakes.

20:41.980 --> 20:43.849
She'll make it worth your while.

20:45.417 --> 20:46.649
A friend of yours?

20:46.651 --> 20:49.154
Yeah, I'm sorry, she's drunk.

20:50.256 --> 20:53.023
It's been a long night.

20:53.025 --> 20:54.024
Alright.

20:54.026 --> 20:55.492
Just make it quick, okay?

20:55.494 --> 20:56.329
Thank you.

20:58.663 --> 21:01.334
Guy's even weirder
looking than the clown was.

21:06.971 --> 21:07.840
This way.

21:11.410 --> 21:12.409
Good thing you called me when I
did.

21:12.411 --> 21:15.144
I was about to bomb the
hell out of this place.

21:15.146 --> 21:16.045
Bomb?

21:16.047 --> 21:17.147
Bug bomb.

21:17.149 --> 21:18.051
Pest control.

21:18.950 --> 21:19.883
What kind of pest?

21:19.885 --> 21:21.384
You sure you want me to tell
you before

21:21.386 --> 21:22.619
you use the bathroom?

21:22.621 --> 21:23.286
Why?

21:23.288 --> 21:24.621
Don't tell me it's roaches.

21:24.623 --> 21:25.656
It's not roaches.

21:25.658 --> 21:26.523
Oh good.

21:26.525 --> 21:27.392
It's rats.

21:28.661 --> 21:29.528
Rats?

21:33.065 --> 21:33.967
All clear.

21:35.034 --> 21:35.932
Are you sure?

21:35.934 --> 21:37.066
Rat free.

21:37.068 --> 21:39.636
What if one crawls out of the
toilet?

21:39.638 --> 21:42.272
I'd make it quick if I were
you.

21:42.274 --> 21:43.142
Good plan.

21:45.510 --> 21:47.643
Do you need me to wait for you
or?

21:47.645 --> 21:49.246
I'll be alright.

21:49.248 --> 21:51.614
You remember how we
came in?

21:51.616 --> 21:52.484
I remember.

21:54.053 --> 21:54.919
Okay.

21:54.921 --> 21:57.955
Well, um, you have a nice night
then.

21:57.957 --> 21:59.255
You too.

21:59.257 --> 22:00.093
Thanks again.

22:01.293 --> 22:02.262
Don't mention it.

22:38.430 --> 22:40.162
Craven's
Halloween Super Store,

22:40.164 --> 22:42.399
the brand new Halloween
super store with over

22:42.401 --> 22:45.401
10,000 square feet of
costumes, accessories,

22:45.403 --> 22:46.636
and decorations.

22:46.638 --> 22:49.272
Miles County's largest Halloween
store.

22:49.274 --> 22:51.574
Kid's costumes, adult costumes,

22:51.576 --> 22:53.442
wigs, hats, and masks.

22:53.444 --> 22:55.678
Makeup, and so much more.

22:55.680 --> 22:59.049
So come in and check
out our huge selection

22:59.051 --> 23:00.553
located at Roma Boulevard.

23:02.421 --> 23:05.322
This is
a WNEW breaking news alert.

23:05.324 --> 23:08.057
We have a major development
in Miles County this evening,

23:08.059 --> 23:10.761
where authorities are
investigating a double homicide.

23:10.763 --> 23:13.130
Two employees at the Deer Hill's
Pizzeria

23:13.132 --> 23:16.365
were found brutally
murdered just moments ago.

23:16.367 --> 23:17.801
No suspects are in custody yet

23:17.803 --> 23:19.268
but police are on the look out

23:19.270 --> 23:21.571
for a tall, thin man
wearing a black and white

23:21.573 --> 23:25.207
clown costume and carrying
a large garbage bag.

23:25.209 --> 23:26.342
No way.

23:26.344 --> 23:27.043
An
eyewitness spotted the suspect

23:27.045 --> 23:29.412
after hearing multiple screams.

23:29.414 --> 23:31.480
No further details at this
moment.

23:31.482 --> 23:33.483
Stay tuned, and we'll
continue to bring you

23:33.485 --> 23:35.755
more breaking updates as
they become available.

23:48.667 --> 23:49.299
Oh my god, you're
never gonna believe what

23:49.301 --> 23:51.304
I just heard on the radio.

25:11.415 --> 25:12.916
Figures.

25:24.796 --> 25:26.228
Oh, I'm sorry.

25:26.230 --> 25:27.099
Shh.

25:28.499 --> 25:30.236
You don't have to say a word.

25:31.402 --> 25:32.805
Your eyes tell me everything.

25:36.208 --> 25:38.774
I didn't mean to frighten you,
dear.

25:38.776 --> 25:41.244
You must be the new tenant.

25:41.246 --> 25:43.216
It's nice to finally meet you.

25:44.783 --> 25:47.786
You're really going to like it
here.

25:48.687 --> 25:50.189
Isn't she, Emily?

25:50.889 --> 25:53.456
This is my daughter, Emily.

25:53.458 --> 25:55.827
Say hello to the pretty young
lady.

26:02.433 --> 26:05.735
It's been quite a while
since we've had neighbors.

26:05.737 --> 26:08.505
Perhaps we can do our laundry
together.

26:08.507 --> 26:10.442
I could use some good company.

26:11.943 --> 26:13.342
Yes.

26:13.344 --> 26:14.747
That sounds like a good idea.

26:17.716 --> 26:19.549
Will you excuse me a moment?

26:19.551 --> 26:21.418
I have to find the landlord.

26:21.420 --> 26:24.891
The first month's rent is due
and I don't wanna be late.

26:27.558 --> 26:30.896
Punctuality is the thief of
time, dear.

30:47.251 --> 30:48.150
Help!

30:48.152 --> 30:49.020
Somebody!

30:50.121 --> 30:50.989
Please!

32:13.971 --> 32:16.205
Happy
Halloween boys and ghouls.

32:16.207 --> 32:18.941
The current temperature
is a crisp 43 degrees.

32:18.943 --> 32:20.709
The winds are starting to pick
up as well,

32:20.711 --> 32:22.879
setting the tone for old
Samhain.

32:22.881 --> 32:24.813
Now if you're still out and
about in

32:24.815 --> 32:27.850
the Miles County Area, I'd
advise you to be extra careful

32:27.852 --> 32:28.551
out there.

32:28.553 --> 32:29.919
Police are still on the look out

32:29.921 --> 32:31.853
for a man involved in a brutal
slaying

32:31.855 --> 32:34.957
of two employees at Deer
Hill's Pizzeria this morning.

32:34.959 --> 32:36.825
The suspect was last seen
wearing

32:36.827 --> 32:38.695
a black and white clown costume

32:38.697 --> 32:40.295
with matching face paint.

32:40.297 --> 32:42.899
If you're just tuning in, this
is not

32:42.901 --> 32:43.867
a Halloween prank.

32:43.869 --> 32:46.268
The local sheriff has advised
all persons

32:46.270 --> 32:48.670
in the Miles County Area to stay
indoors

32:48.672 --> 32:50.907
and notify authorities if they
see anyone

32:50.909 --> 32:53.176
matching the assailant's
description.

32:53.178 --> 32:54.046
Really?

34:04.716 --> 34:05.383
Mister!

34:06.884 --> 34:08.119
Help me, please.

34:09.687 --> 34:10.922
Help me, please.

34:16.027 --> 34:17.460
Mister!

41:04.368 --> 41:06.203
Come on, motherfucker!

41:08.672 --> 41:09.640
Come on!

41:16.814 --> 41:17.716
Get up!

41:20.317 --> 41:21.620
Get the fuck up!

41:26.556 --> 41:27.392
Get up!

42:01.325 --> 42:02.194
Shh.

42:03.761 --> 42:04.796
It's alright, mommy.

42:06.263 --> 42:08.464
It's only the wind.

42:08.466 --> 42:10.699
It can't hurt you.

42:10.701 --> 42:12.304
I won't let anything hurt you.

42:48.739 --> 42:50.638
I guess the new neighbors
weren't such

42:50.640 --> 42:52.576
a good idea after all.

47:07.864 --> 47:09.531
Jesus Christ.

47:09.533 --> 47:11.098
Can you help me, please?

47:11.100 --> 47:13.100
Who are you? How the
hell did you get in here?

47:13.102 --> 47:14.937
You have to come with me now.

47:14.939 --> 47:16.904
There's a dead woman in your
basement.

47:16.906 --> 47:17.806
What?

47:17.808 --> 47:18.674
Yes.

47:18.676 --> 47:19.507
Dead.

47:19.509 --> 47:20.509
Dead, all dead.

47:20.511 --> 47:23.612
He's killing them one by
one by one, like cows.

47:23.614 --> 47:25.179
Look, lady.

47:25.181 --> 47:26.380
Lady.

47:26.382 --> 47:28.183
If you don't go away right
now, I'm gonna call the cops.

47:28.185 --> 47:29.717
Yes, that's what I've been
saying.

47:29.719 --> 47:31.620
You need to call the
police right away because

47:31.622 --> 47:33.054
he's right downstairs
and he's probably going

47:33.056 --> 47:34.922
to kill you, too, if
you don't get somebody

47:34.924 --> 47:35.790
down here right away.

47:35.792 --> 47:36.824
What the fuck are you talking
about?

47:36.826 --> 47:38.226
The clown with the
white face and the little

47:38.228 --> 47:39.428
black hat.

47:39.430 --> 47:41.562
He thinks what he's doing is
funny because he's laughing.

47:41.564 --> 47:44.199
But I know it's not funny
because they're all dead.

47:44.201 --> 47:45.833
Get the hell away from me.

47:45.835 --> 47:46.902
I'm telling you.

47:46.904 --> 47:50.105
He knows I know, and he's
gonna try and kill me

47:50.107 --> 47:51.739
before he kills you.

47:51.741 --> 47:53.040
Don't touch me.

47:53.042 --> 47:53.708
Don't!

47:53.710 --> 47:55.243
Help me, please, help me.

47:55.245 --> 47:56.914
I said, get the hell away from
me!

48:05.556 --> 48:06.955
Emily.

48:06.957 --> 48:07.826
Emily.

48:14.265 --> 48:15.933
Hello?

48:17.301 --> 48:18.069
Is anybody in here?

48:19.536 --> 48:22.140
What The fuck is going on
here?

48:41.292 --> 48:43.125
Wow.

48:43.127 --> 48:45.794
Yeah, this better be good, man.

48:45.796 --> 48:46.661
What happened?

48:46.663 --> 48:47.564
You burn the place down?

48:48.966 --> 48:49.868
Hello?

48:51.569 --> 48:52.203
Mike?

48:54.138 --> 48:55.670
Wow, you flipped out?

48:55.672 --> 48:56.507
Hello?

48:57.274 --> 49:00.875
Yo!

49:05.281 --> 49:06.149
Tara?

49:08.785 --> 49:09.653
Dawn?

49:11.187 --> 49:12.055
Hello?

49:24.602 --> 49:25.270
No.

49:27.937 --> 49:28.839
Emily?

49:33.076 --> 49:33.944
Emily?

49:37.147 --> 49:38.049
Okay.

49:39.015 --> 49:40.617
You're scaring mommy now.

50:00.303 --> 50:01.171
Hello?

50:04.674 --> 50:05.676
Anyone here?

50:16.319 --> 50:17.321
Come on, you guys.

50:19.656 --> 50:20.924
Emily, mommy's here.

50:21.859 --> 50:22.727
Where are you?

50:24.928 --> 50:25.797
Emily?

50:27.263 --> 50:28.098
Honey?

50:47.817 --> 50:48.685
Tara?

51:01.864 --> 51:02.899
Give her to me.

51:07.471 --> 51:08.339
Please.

51:10.239 --> 51:12.207
Don't hurt my little girl.

51:21.250 --> 51:22.719
You're frightening her.

51:23.886 --> 51:24.921
Can't you see that?

51:25.922 --> 51:26.790
Emily?

51:27.757 --> 51:28.924
It's okay.

51:28.926 --> 51:29.794
Mommy's here.

51:48.245 --> 51:49.881
Is there kindness in you?

51:53.149 --> 51:55.385
Somewhere in your heart?

52:00.924 --> 52:04.762
Have you ever felt a mother's
touch?

52:11.935 --> 52:13.904
Can you show no mercy?

52:17.473 --> 52:20.777
She's all I have in this world.

52:23.547 --> 52:24.415
Spare her.

53:05.221 --> 53:06.089
Shh.

53:08.524 --> 53:09.359
It's okay.

53:13.462 --> 53:14.332
Shh.

53:51.602 --> 53:52.868
Hi, you've reached
Mike.

53:52.870 --> 53:54.002
Of course.

53:54.004 --> 53:55.870
Leave a message,
and I'll get back to you.

53:55.872 --> 53:57.438
Mike, I'm outside.

53:57.440 --> 54:00.141
Every fuckin' door in
this place is locked.

54:00.143 --> 54:01.379
Answer your phone!

54:02.913 --> 54:03.581
Asshole.

54:11.187 --> 54:12.055
Hello?

54:14.357 --> 54:15.892
Is anybody in there?

54:18.294 --> 54:21.565
This is the fucking last time I
do this.

54:23.634 --> 54:26.237
No consideration whatsoever.

54:32.408 --> 54:33.276
Dawn?

54:43.687 --> 54:44.555
Hello?

54:46.189 --> 54:47.058
Guys.

54:57.301 --> 54:58.466
I know you're in there.

54:58.468 --> 55:00.404
Dawn, I can hear your phone.

55:12.015 --> 55:13.281
I swear to god, if this is a
prank,

55:13.283 --> 55:14.652
I'm gonna kill you both.

55:53.056 --> 55:53.925
Tara!

56:02.665 --> 56:03.533
Tara!

56:05.067 --> 56:06.336
Can you hear me?

56:51.348 --> 56:53.248
Oh, Tara, Tara, you're okay.
It's okay.

56:53.250 --> 56:54.685
I'm gonna get help.

56:57.687 --> 56:58.989
What the fuck?

57:01.190 --> 57:02.625
Oh, it'll be okay.

57:03.627 --> 57:05.363
God, what's going on?

57:05.629 --> 57:07.661
Emily?

57:09.198 --> 57:10.066
Help me.

57:12.602 --> 57:13.471
Help me.

57:35.192 --> 57:36.794
Somebody please help!

57:43.732 --> 57:44.602
Please!

57:52.174 --> 57:53.440
Help!

57:53.442 --> 57:55.446
Somebody please help me!

59:17.527 --> 59:18.796
Please, stop it!

59:20.730 --> 59:22.867
No, please leave me alone!

59:30.707 --> 59:31.642
Yo, Mike!

59:43.453 --> 59:44.655
Son of a bitch.

59:51.560 --> 59:52.829
You're on your own, buddy.

01:00:29.899 --> 01:00:30.801
Mike!

01:00:46.015 --> 01:00:47.250
Hello?

01:07:26.281 --> 01:07:27.116
Come on.

01:07:51.140 --> 01:07:52.009
No.

01:08:16.299 --> 01:08:17.667
You can't be dead, Tara.

01:08:18.768 --> 01:08:19.703
Fuck, Tara.

01:08:22.772 --> 01:08:24.804
Please wake up.

01:08:24.805 --> 01:08:28.045
No, you can't be dead, Tara,
look at me.

01:09:17.260 --> 01:09:19.125
I'm gonna get you out of here.

01:09:19.127 --> 01:09:23.200
Come on, I'm gonna get
you out of here right now.

01:09:40.381 --> 01:09:41.981
Oh Jesus, you alright?

01:09:41.983 --> 01:09:43.053
Stay with me.

01:09:44.287 --> 01:09:45.953
I'm feeling a little tired.

01:09:45.955 --> 01:09:47.487
I know, it's okay.

01:09:47.488 --> 01:09:49.126
Just relax, it's gonna be fine.

01:09:55.564 --> 01:09:56.263
There's a phone over there.

01:09:56.265 --> 01:09:57.597
I'm gonna call the police, okay?

01:09:57.599 --> 01:09:59.033
No!

01:09:59.035 --> 01:10:00.133
Please don't leave, don't leave
me.

01:10:00.135 --> 01:10:02.535
I am not gonna leave you, I
promise.

01:10:02.537 --> 01:10:03.904
I'm just going right over there.

01:10:03.906 --> 01:10:04.774
Look.

01:10:13.416 --> 01:10:14.248
911, emergency.

01:10:14.250 --> 01:10:15.883
Uh yes, I need the
police

01:10:15.885 --> 01:10:16.883
and paramedics here right away.

01:10:16.885 --> 01:10:18.185
What's wrong, sir?

01:10:18.187 --> 01:10:19.119
I wanna report a murder.

01:10:19.121 --> 01:10:20.286
There's two dead people.

01:10:20.288 --> 01:10:21.554
I've got this young woman over
here

01:10:21.556 --> 01:10:22.423
that's just been assaulted.

01:10:22.425 --> 01:10:23.457
She's bleeding everywhere.

01:10:23.459 --> 01:10:25.159
I think she's going into shock.

01:10:25.161 --> 01:10:26.927
Okay, give me your
address.

01:10:26.929 --> 01:10:29.366
Uh, Steuben Street,
it's the old warehouse.

01:10:30.398 --> 01:10:32.432
What kind of
injuries does she have?

01:10:32.434 --> 01:10:33.534
She's cut all over.

01:10:33.536 --> 01:10:36.270
Some places really deep.

01:10:36.272 --> 01:10:37.937
I don't know, she's
bleeding all over the place.

01:10:37.939 --> 01:10:39.138
Is she conscious?

01:10:39.140 --> 01:10:40.908
Yes, she conscious, but I have
no idea

01:10:40.910 --> 01:10:42.075
for how long.

01:10:42.077 --> 01:10:43.477
Where is the
assailant now?

01:10:43.479 --> 01:10:44.881
I knocked him out.

01:10:45.581 --> 01:10:48.982
If this guy wakes up,
we are not safe here.

01:10:48.984 --> 01:10:52.288
This guy is armed and he's
a total fucking maniac.

01:10:53.355 --> 01:10:55.121
Okay, sir,
what I want you to do now

01:10:55.123 --> 01:10:57.391
is just remain calm and
stay on the line with me

01:10:57.393 --> 01:10:58.595
until the police arrive.

01:10:59.629 --> 01:11:00.494
Look.

01:11:00.496 --> 01:11:01.462
We are not staying here.

01:11:01.464 --> 01:11:03.230
I'm taking this girl
to the emergency room.

01:11:03.232 --> 01:11:05.468
You just get your asses down
here now.

01:11:07.536 --> 01:11:08.368
I got my truck outside.

01:11:08.370 --> 01:11:09.570
Can you walk?

01:11:09.572 --> 01:11:11.038
Okay.

01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:14.240
Come on, let's get out of here.

01:11:24.086 --> 01:11:24.955
Dammit!

01:11:49.545 --> 01:11:50.480
No, stop!

01:11:52.380 --> 01:11:53.646
Stop!

01:12:48.537 --> 01:12:49.406
Dammit!

01:13:47.662 --> 01:13:49.730
Get away from me!

01:13:49.732 --> 01:13:51.100
Leave me alone!

01:13:51.834 --> 01:13:53.502
You fucking maniac!

01:13:55.104 --> 01:13:58.605
Leave me alone!

01:13:58.607 --> 01:13:59.743
Stop, stop it!

01:16:05.501 --> 01:16:07.801
Police, don't fuckin' move!

01:16:07.803 --> 01:16:09.203
Put your hands up right now!

01:16:09.205 --> 01:16:09.835
Central.

01:16:09.837 --> 01:16:10.736
10-13, male perp.

01:16:10.738 --> 01:16:11.605
Possibly armed.

01:16:11.607 --> 01:16:12.472
Let me see your hands!

01:16:12.474 --> 01:16:13.140
Send more units.

01:16:13.142 --> 01:16:14.441
I said show me your hands!

01:16:14.443 --> 01:16:15.275
Put 'em up!

01:16:15.277 --> 01:16:17.147
I said put your fuckin' hands
up!

01:16:21.250 --> 01:16:23.283
That's it, nice and easy.

01:16:23.285 --> 01:16:24.985
No sudden moves.

01:16:24.987 --> 01:16:26.253
Your right hand.

01:16:26.255 --> 01:16:27.221
Show me the right hand.

01:16:27.223 --> 01:16:27.887
Last warning.

01:16:27.889 --> 01:16:29.224
You're gonna get shot!

01:16:38.399 --> 01:16:39.268
Do it!

01:16:42.638 --> 01:16:43.869
No, no, no!

01:16:53.482 --> 01:16:56.816
Central, we got shots fired.

01:16:56.818 --> 01:16:58.220
Multiple causalities.

01:16:59.455 --> 01:17:02.755
We needed buses and immediate
assistance.

01:17:07.563 --> 01:17:08.829
Oh my god.

01:17:08.831 --> 01:17:09.732
What?

01:17:13.669 --> 01:17:15.404
She's still alive.

01:17:39.795 --> 01:17:40.793
Aw, come on, guys.

01:17:40.795 --> 01:17:41.928
You're killin' me.

01:17:41.930 --> 01:17:44.500
The revolving doors won't
be installed until Monday.

01:17:45.367 --> 01:17:46.703
Good to see you, too, doc.

01:17:49.337 --> 01:17:50.704
Okay, what
are you bringing me?

01:17:50.706 --> 01:17:52.739
Murder, suicide.

01:17:52.741 --> 01:17:53.906
Wonderful.

01:17:53.908 --> 01:17:55.741
What's behind showcase number
one?

01:17:55.743 --> 01:17:57.343
Severe head trauma.

01:17:57.345 --> 01:17:58.611
You're probably gonna have to
identify

01:17:58.613 --> 01:18:00.746
this poor bastard by his teeth,

01:18:00.748 --> 01:18:02.883
if you can dig them out
of the back of his skull.

01:18:02.885 --> 01:18:05.384
So I should put on a seventh
pot of coffee, then, huh?

01:18:05.386 --> 01:18:06.753
You're gonna need
something a lot stronger

01:18:06.755 --> 01:18:07.753
than coffee.

01:18:07.755 --> 01:18:10.490
Landon said they just
found two more bodies.

01:18:10.492 --> 01:18:12.825
Jesus, they get the sick
fuck that's doing this?

01:18:12.827 --> 01:18:14.029
Showcase number two.

01:18:16.631 --> 01:18:17.664
No shit.

01:18:17.666 --> 01:18:19.665
Police found him eating
the face off of some

01:18:19.667 --> 01:18:22.668
young girl after he ran
her over with a truck.

01:18:22.670 --> 01:18:26.940
He blew his brains out before
they could take him in, so.

01:18:26.942 --> 01:18:28.709
Halloween never disappoints,
does it?

01:18:28.711 --> 01:18:30.811
And it looks like it's
just getting started.

01:18:30.813 --> 01:18:32.012
Well, seeing as how I'm gonna
be here

01:18:32.014 --> 01:18:34.384
for another 24 hours, thanks to
you,

01:18:35.084 --> 01:18:36.917
you guys think you could
get me a breakfast sandwich

01:18:36.919 --> 01:18:38.985
with bacon, or something with
bacon?

01:18:38.987 --> 01:18:40.023
Bacon, really?

01:18:41.023 --> 01:18:42.789
I thought you were
watching your cholesterol.

01:18:42.791 --> 01:18:44.024
I am watchin' it.

01:18:44.026 --> 01:18:45.491
Watchin' it go up.

01:18:45.493 --> 01:18:46.826
Who's the MD around here?

01:18:46.828 --> 01:18:48.594
How can you eat a greasy
croissant while

01:18:48.596 --> 01:18:50.530
you're cutting up dead bodies?

01:18:50.532 --> 01:18:51.530
Sweetheart.

01:18:51.532 --> 01:18:53.566
I've been doin' this 22 years.

01:18:53.568 --> 01:18:54.801
Alright, once you've
seen an eight month old

01:18:54.803 --> 01:18:55.837
microwaved to death,

01:18:57.739 --> 01:18:59.442
everything else is just old hat.

01:19:01.710 --> 01:19:03.442
Look, you had to ask, alright?

01:19:03.444 --> 01:19:04.945
I'll hook you up, doc.

01:19:04.947 --> 01:19:05.882
That's my guy.

01:19:07.683 --> 01:19:09.385
Stay safe out there.

01:19:20.395 --> 01:19:21.063
Jesus.

01:19:31.639 --> 01:19:34.943
Let's have a look at the man of
the hour.

01:19:45.787 --> 01:19:47.753
I hope your 15 minutes
of fame was worth it,

01:19:47.755 --> 01:19:49.424
you sick son of a bitch.

01:20:08.143 --> 01:20:11.578
You're really
going to like it here.

01:20:56.625 --> 01:20:58.191
Thanks again for everything,
doctor.

01:20:58.193 --> 01:20:59.758
You'll be in our prayers.

01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:01.895
Please, don't mention it.

01:21:01.897 --> 01:21:03.629
We're all gonna miss this one.

01:21:03.631 --> 01:21:04.998
She's been so cooperative.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:06.866
Makes everyone laugh.

01:21:07.970 --> 01:21:08.602
Well she certainly hasn't
lost her sense of humor.

01:21:08.604 --> 01:21:10.473
Yeah, still a wise ass.

01:21:11.172 --> 01:21:12.038
It's good.

01:21:12.040 --> 01:21:13.573
It's a good thing.

01:21:13.575 --> 01:21:15.174
It's important to stay positive,
right?

01:21:15.176 --> 01:21:16.610
Absolutely.

01:21:16.612 --> 01:21:17.744
Good spirits.

01:21:17.746 --> 01:21:18.648
She'll be fine.

01:21:19.881 --> 01:21:21.847
Well, take care of yourself,
Victoria.
