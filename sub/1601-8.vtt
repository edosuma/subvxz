WEBVTT

00:02.043 --> 00:04.149
You're gonna raid Nick Ford's warehouse?

00:04.164 --> 00:05.108
That's right.

00:05.124 --> 00:07.788
- Are you with me or not?
- I'm not.

00:14.829 --> 00:16.697
Did you know Norman is having blackouts?

00:16.798 --> 00:18.332
That girl, Cody Brennen, told me.

00:18.433 --> 00:20.100
She said that Norman has blacked out twice

00:20.201 --> 00:21.268
when he's been with her.

00:21.336 --> 00:22.436
Your mom warned me

00:22.504 --> 00:23.837
not to talk about your blackouts.

00:23.938 --> 00:26.206
She said something happens to you in them.

00:26.307 --> 00:28.308
Don't lie again!

00:28.410 --> 00:30.878
You told her something
happens to me when I black out.

00:30.979 --> 00:33.113
You said I change, that I'm not myself.

00:33.214 --> 00:34.314
Who am I, mother?

00:34.416 --> 00:36.116
Who am I, and what do I do?

00:36.217 --> 00:37.551
I'm not gonna answer your question,

00:37.619 --> 00:40.220
and I don't want you to ever ask me again.

00:40.321 --> 00:42.823
I logged Norman Bates' DNA into our system.

00:42.891 --> 00:44.658
The semen sample in Blaire Watson

00:44.759 --> 00:46.727
matched Norman Bates.

01:08.450 --> 01:09.817
Norman?

01:13.621 --> 01:14.922
Norman?

01:24.466 --> 01:26.467
Norman?

02:15.283 --> 02:17.084
Morning.

02:17.185 --> 02:18.552
Coffee's fresh.

02:18.653 --> 02:22.589
Yeah, I know. I was counting on it.

02:48.616 --> 02:51.251
Is there something the matter?

02:53.688 --> 02:55.188
Out of cream.

02:55.256 --> 02:57.190
Oh, sorry.

02:57.258 --> 02:59.660
I can run up to the house and get some.

02:59.761 --> 03:03.630
No, it's fine. I'll drink it black.

03:09.904 --> 03:11.872
Bye, Sheriff.

03:13.908 --> 03:15.642
Good morning.

03:20.948 --> 03:22.715
Look what I brought you.

03:22.817 --> 03:25.051
Oh, yeah, I already ate. Thanks.

03:29.757 --> 03:31.091
Guess what we're doing tonight?

03:31.192 --> 03:32.225
Hmm?

03:32.326 --> 03:35.161
Double Indemnity is playing at the Vista.

03:35.229 --> 03:36.663
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

03:36.764 --> 03:37.697
I thought you and I could go together,

03:37.765 --> 03:38.932
mother-son date.

03:39.033 --> 03:40.800
Yeah, ah, I'd like to,

03:40.868 --> 03:43.136
even though we've seen it
about a hundred times, but...

03:46.307 --> 03:47.740
Oh, since you're here,

03:47.842 --> 03:52.011
I'm gonna go back up to the house.

03:52.113 --> 03:54.848
Got to finish that owl
I've been working on, huh?

03:54.949 --> 03:57.317
Norman, it's not...

03:57.342 --> 03:59.373
It's not my fault.

03:59.410 --> 04:01.287
It's not me. It's just the situation.

04:01.388 --> 04:03.189
Oh, you mean the situation

04:03.257 --> 04:05.758
where you don't tell me the
secrets you know about me?

04:05.860 --> 04:08.261
- Norman.
- No, I've accepted it.

04:08.329 --> 04:09.996
It's... it's fine.

04:13.167 --> 04:15.268
Hello, Norma.

04:15.336 --> 04:16.803
Hi, Nick.

04:16.904 --> 04:20.072
Well, what brings you here?

04:23.878 --> 04:26.980
I'd like you to do me a favor.

04:27.081 --> 04:29.582
Hmm?

04:29.683 --> 04:33.319
And I prefer asking in person.

04:33.420 --> 04:36.756
I'm old-fashioned that way.

04:36.824 --> 04:38.591
That's nice.

04:38.692 --> 04:40.660
You have a son, Dylan Massett?

04:40.728 --> 04:44.230
- Yes.
- He works for Morgan family?

04:44.331 --> 04:47.066
Well, I-I don't exactly know.

04:47.168 --> 04:48.835
He does.

04:48.903 --> 04:51.604
I'd like for you to arrange
a meeting between us.

04:51.705 --> 04:52.605
Us?

04:52.706 --> 04:54.374
Your son and myself.

04:54.475 --> 04:56.042
Why?

04:56.110 --> 04:57.777
There's some things we need to discuss.

04:57.878 --> 04:59.145
Like what?

04:59.246 --> 05:02.715
That's between him and me.

05:02.816 --> 05:05.585
- You and my son, Dylan?
- Yes.

05:05.653 --> 05:09.923
We're in the same business.

05:10.024 --> 05:12.992
Don't you talk to your son about anything?

05:15.129 --> 05:17.931
Not so much about work.

05:18.032 --> 05:21.267
I don't like what he does.

05:21.368 --> 05:23.670
I'm not asking you to get your hands dirty.

05:23.771 --> 05:29.108
All you need to do is tell
him that we need to meet.

05:29.210 --> 05:32.345
We don't really talk. We had a falling out.

05:32.446 --> 05:33.813
If for no other reason,

05:33.914 --> 05:36.816
you need to see him and fix that.

05:36.917 --> 05:38.685
I lost a daughter.

05:38.752 --> 05:41.154
I was estranged from her when it happened.

05:41.222 --> 05:43.089
I can tell you, it's
the most horrible thing

05:43.190 --> 05:45.925
that ever happened to me.

05:46.026 --> 05:47.694
Talk to your son.

05:47.761 --> 05:52.065
Do it while you can.

05:52.132 --> 05:55.902
Do it right away.

07:13.380 --> 07:15.181
You recognize any of these guys?

07:15.282 --> 07:17.784
That's Dave Wilson's kid.

07:17.885 --> 07:20.153
He was running the shift.

07:20.254 --> 07:23.022
All these people, low-level workers.

07:26.293 --> 07:29.329
All right, I want you to
find where Zane Morgan is.

07:29.430 --> 07:32.565
Put every resource we got on it.

07:32.666 --> 07:35.068
And when you find him, don't arrest him.

07:35.169 --> 07:36.669
What do you want us to do?

07:36.737 --> 07:40.940
Tell me where he is.

08:04.932 --> 08:06.699
Jodi!

08:06.767 --> 08:09.635
What's going on?

08:09.737 --> 08:11.904
Your brother's out of his mind.

08:12.005 --> 08:13.940
He raided the Ford warehouse last night.

08:14.041 --> 08:15.641
I tried to stop them.

08:15.743 --> 08:17.677
Oh, my God.

08:26.120 --> 08:28.121
Hey, it's Dylan. Leave a message.

08:37.331 --> 08:40.299
Hi, Norma.

08:40.366 --> 08:42.835
How much do you know about this town?

08:42.936 --> 08:45.171
A lot, I guess. Like what?

08:45.239 --> 08:51.177
Do you know where Dylan
works? I need to talk to him.

08:51.245 --> 08:53.980
Uh, do you know what Dylan does?

08:55.983 --> 08:57.917
I know that he works

08:57.985 --> 09:00.887
for one of these marijuana companies.

09:00.988 --> 09:03.356
I'll go with you. I can
show you where it is.

09:05.893 --> 09:07.026
Huh, what do you know, huh?

09:07.094 --> 09:08.027
You're never down at the dry dock.

09:08.095 --> 09:09.695
You know, Uncle Gil,

09:09.797 --> 09:11.130
he worked for dad for 25 years,

09:11.231 --> 09:12.565
and they just walked into his house,

09:12.633 --> 09:13.633
and they killed him.

09:13.734 --> 09:15.568
How would you have handled it?

09:15.636 --> 09:18.070
Well, what I wouldn't have
done is start an all-out war.

09:18.172 --> 09:19.906
Well, that's because you
don't have a clue, Jodi.

09:20.007 --> 09:21.541
You just sit up here all day long

09:21.642 --> 09:23.176
and play with your stupid little plants.

09:23.243 --> 09:25.912
Look, I get that you resented
that dad gave me the business,

09:26.013 --> 09:28.714
but do not go destroying
how we all make a living

09:28.816 --> 09:30.283
because you need to prove yourself.

09:30.384 --> 09:32.318
All right, you begged me
to come home and help you.

09:32.419 --> 09:33.753
I-I begged you?

09:33.821 --> 09:35.087
This isn't gonna help right now.

09:35.189 --> 09:37.924
Okay, no offense, but how you two

09:38.025 --> 09:39.792
feel about each other is pretty irrelevant.

09:39.893 --> 09:41.127
What we need to do is figure out

09:41.195 --> 09:43.663
what the hell we're gonna do.

09:45.699 --> 09:47.066
I got a plan,

09:47.167 --> 09:48.935
if you would just shut
up long enough to listen.

09:49.036 --> 09:50.603
Oh, yeah, what's that?

09:50.704 --> 09:52.238
Hire Han Solo to crash
the Millennium Falcon

09:52.306 --> 09:55.842
into the Ford warehouse?

09:55.943 --> 09:58.778
Nick Ford's old, right?

09:58.846 --> 10:00.613
We offer him a buyout.

10:00.714 --> 10:02.014
If he says no, we tell him

10:02.115 --> 10:03.115
he's gonna get more of the same.

10:03.217 --> 10:04.884
We wear him down.

10:04.952 --> 10:06.819
We wear him down until he says yes.

10:06.920 --> 10:10.756
Then we take over the damn town.

10:12.392 --> 10:15.027
- That's your plan?
- Mm-hmm.

10:15.128 --> 10:16.696
Look.

10:16.763 --> 10:18.030
Right now, right this minute,

10:18.131 --> 10:19.365
there's a bunch of pissed off people

10:19.466 --> 10:21.767
who are gonna be gunning
for your head, Zane.

10:21.869 --> 10:25.104
The thing you need to
do is lay low somewhere.

10:28.141 --> 10:30.743
You know where to go.

10:34.114 --> 10:37.149
You're gonna see.

11:01.074 --> 11:02.642
I don't know if it's a good idea

11:02.709 --> 11:04.043
to go in there unannounced.

11:04.144 --> 11:05.945
Well, he won't answer my calls.

11:06.046 --> 11:08.681
I have no choice.

11:08.782 --> 11:10.349
Be careful.

11:29.369 --> 11:31.203
What do you want?

11:31.271 --> 11:36.075
Uh, I'm just here to see
my son, Dylan Massett.

11:36.176 --> 11:38.844
Oh, shit.

11:38.912 --> 11:42.381
Didn't recognize you.

11:45.252 --> 11:48.020
It's down this way here.

11:49.923 --> 11:52.091
Where are you taking me?

11:52.192 --> 11:53.659
To his office.

11:53.727 --> 11:55.328
Dylan has an office?

11:55.429 --> 11:57.697
Yeah.

12:08.108 --> 12:11.210
Yeah, come in.

12:14.815 --> 12:18.150
Your mom is here.

12:18.218 --> 12:19.919
What are you doing here?

12:20.020 --> 12:23.756
I, uh, I came to see you.

12:23.857 --> 12:26.592
About?

12:26.660 --> 12:31.330
Um, about this man, Nick Ford.

12:31.431 --> 12:33.633
What the hell do you
have to do with Nick Ford?

12:33.734 --> 12:36.102
Well, nothing really, except
that I met him at a party,

12:36.203 --> 12:37.870
and he started helping me figure out

12:37.938 --> 12:39.038
how to stop the bypass,

12:39.139 --> 12:41.774
and now he wants a favor from me.

12:41.875 --> 12:44.176
What favor?

12:44.277 --> 12:48.948
He... he wants to meet with you.

12:49.049 --> 12:51.083
Is this really your office?

12:51.151 --> 12:53.152
Yeah.

12:57.124 --> 12:58.791
It's nice, Dylan.

12:58.859 --> 13:00.393
I mean, I don't like the marijuana part,

13:00.494 --> 13:03.963
but I'm glad you're doing so well.

13:04.064 --> 13:05.297
Why does he want to meet with me?

13:05.399 --> 13:06.666
I don't know. He didn't tell me.

13:06.767 --> 13:09.001
He said it was important, though.

13:09.069 --> 13:10.870
He probably wants to meet me

13:10.971 --> 13:12.838
so he can put a bullet through my head.

13:12.939 --> 13:15.074
What do you mean?

13:15.142 --> 13:17.677
He's in charge of the rival drug family.

13:17.778 --> 13:20.112
Some bad shit went down between us.

13:20.213 --> 13:22.014
There's no way I can meet with him.

13:22.115 --> 13:24.884
Tell him you couldn't find me, okay?

13:24.985 --> 13:27.153
And don't have anything
more to do with him.

13:27.254 --> 13:28.688
He's dangerous.

13:30.891 --> 13:33.192
Well, I don't want you to get hurt.

13:33.260 --> 13:35.428
I don't ever want you to get hurt.

13:37.564 --> 13:38.764
You better go, Norma.

13:38.832 --> 13:41.433
Are you around weed all the time?

13:41.534 --> 13:44.269
You know, cannabinoids
can actually get absorbed

13:44.370 --> 13:46.472
into all sorts of different
parts in your body.

13:46.573 --> 13:48.073
I'm not rolling around in it.

13:48.174 --> 13:50.142
Well, still, I mean, did you do anything

13:50.210 --> 13:51.276
to protect yourself?

13:51.377 --> 13:53.378
- Norma.
- I'm still your mother.

13:53.480 --> 13:55.247
You can't be here, okay? You gotta go.

13:55.315 --> 13:58.650
There's lots of stuff
we haven't talked about.

14:02.655 --> 14:05.224
I can't.

14:05.325 --> 14:09.094
You need to go now.

14:09.195 --> 14:11.029
You walk her out?

14:11.131 --> 14:13.132
Yeah.

14:17.237 --> 14:18.737
Bye, Dylan.

14:45.750 --> 14:48.085
Hey.

14:48.186 --> 14:50.621
- Did you hear the news?
- What news?

14:50.688 --> 14:54.258
The bypass temporarily halted
for environmental studies.

14:54.325 --> 14:55.759
- Really?
- Yeah.

14:55.860 --> 14:58.962
I can't believe it!

15:03.134 --> 15:06.870
Norma, I've gotta say something.

15:06.971 --> 15:10.674
It's great being your friend,
but it's not enough for me.

15:10.742 --> 15:12.276
I need to know if you're interested

15:12.377 --> 15:14.912
in this being anything else,

15:15.013 --> 15:17.648
so I can stop making
an idiot out of myself.

15:19.951 --> 15:22.019
Okay.

15:23.021 --> 15:23.987
Okay, yes?

15:24.089 --> 15:25.322
Okay, no?

15:25.390 --> 15:27.157
I'm not sure what I'm agreeing to.

15:27.225 --> 15:28.559
A date.

15:28.660 --> 15:29.927
Tomorrow night, my place for dinner.

15:30.028 --> 15:31.929
Say 7:00.

15:33.998 --> 15:35.866
Okay.

15:35.934 --> 15:37.034
Okay.

15:43.141 --> 15:45.142
We're sitting on the dry dock,

15:45.210 --> 15:46.610
Jodi Morgan's house,

15:46.678 --> 15:48.112
and the apartment he's renting.

15:48.213 --> 15:49.746
Zane hasn't been near any of them,

15:49.848 --> 15:53.016
- so should we just...
- Yeah, work harder.

15:53.118 --> 15:55.185
Get information out of people.

15:55.286 --> 15:57.254
Don't be nice about it, and don't bother me

15:57.322 --> 15:59.256
or make excuses until you find him.

15:59.324 --> 16:01.058
You got all that?

16:01.159 --> 16:03.026
Yes, sir.

16:57.348 --> 16:59.616
Get out.

16:59.717 --> 17:01.985
- Look, I thought...
- Get out.

17:10.261 --> 17:13.664
Where the hell is Zane Morgan?

17:13.731 --> 17:17.733
I don't know, man. I
don't know where he is.

17:21.739 --> 17:23.941
Look, I'd tell you if I knew!

17:24.008 --> 17:29.079
You think I wanted any of this to happen?

17:29.180 --> 17:31.848
You hear anything, you need to tell me.

17:31.916 --> 17:33.150
And if I find out you're lying to me,

17:33.218 --> 17:34.952
you're gonna be dead, you understand?

17:35.019 --> 17:37.654
- You understand?
- Yeah, okay.

17:37.755 --> 17:39.756
Okay.

17:43.228 --> 17:46.396
Go. Get out of here.

18:15.827 --> 18:18.262
What are you doing?

18:18.329 --> 18:21.531
I thought you'd like some
of my work in the house.

18:21.599 --> 18:23.033
I know how much you like it.

18:23.134 --> 18:25.636
Isn't this lovely? Look, feel it.

18:25.703 --> 18:29.139
So soft, just like it's real.

18:29.240 --> 18:32.609
It is soft.

18:32.710 --> 18:34.845
What?

18:34.946 --> 18:36.747
Just not really sure they go.

18:36.848 --> 18:38.081
Well, sure they go.

18:38.149 --> 18:39.583
That's the great thing about taxidermy.

18:39.684 --> 18:41.685
It goes with everything. It's nature.

18:43.955 --> 18:45.188
Norman, you wouldn't be doing this

18:45.256 --> 18:46.590
because you're mad at me, would you?

18:46.691 --> 18:48.158
I have no reason to be mad at you.

18:48.259 --> 18:49.960
I love my work, and I'm sharing it with you

18:50.061 --> 18:52.496
because I love you.

18:52.597 --> 18:54.164
Okay.

18:55.900 --> 18:57.834
Enjoy.

18:57.902 --> 19:00.070
Thank you.

19:30.268 --> 19:32.836
Oh, hey.

19:32.937 --> 19:35.172
The rod that holds up the shower curtain

19:35.273 --> 19:36.673
just broke out of the wall.

19:36.741 --> 19:38.175
- Oh, dear.
- Well, maybe Norman

19:38.276 --> 19:40.577
can hold it up for me while I fix it.

19:40.645 --> 19:42.646
Okay.

19:44.916 --> 19:46.616
So how did you...

19:46.718 --> 19:49.219
How did you break the curtain rod, Sheriff?

19:49.287 --> 19:51.722
Well, one of those rings was stuck in here,

19:51.823 --> 19:54.558
and I just... I jiggled
it a little too hard.

19:54.659 --> 19:55.892
I'm almost done here.

19:55.993 --> 19:58.929
- Oh.
- Oopsy-daisy, I got it.

20:01.099 --> 20:05.102
Thanks.

20:05.203 --> 20:06.703
Hey, how...

20:06.771 --> 20:10.707
How well did you know, um, Blaire Watson?

20:10.775 --> 20:13.944
Uh, well, she was my teacher, so...

20:14.045 --> 20:15.946
Yeah, but I mean, did
you know anything else

20:16.047 --> 20:17.080
about her?

20:17.181 --> 20:20.617
Not really.

20:20.685 --> 20:23.286
She seem stable to you?

20:23.388 --> 20:25.222
Mostly, yes.

20:25.323 --> 20:27.224
Mostly?

20:27.325 --> 20:29.359
Most... No, I didn't mean that.

20:29.460 --> 20:31.895
She was very professional.

20:31.963 --> 20:33.697
You know, a good teacher, a good counselor.

20:33.765 --> 20:37.000
- She...
- But why mostly?

20:37.101 --> 20:40.670
Oh, well, she just...

20:40.772 --> 20:45.008
She seemed a little... Sad and lost,

20:45.109 --> 20:48.645
I guess, at times.

20:48.746 --> 20:51.047
You ever see her outside of school?

20:51.149 --> 20:53.583
Mm-mm. No. Uh-uh.

20:53.684 --> 20:57.287
You told me before that you did.

20:57.388 --> 21:02.259
But for a school project, so it's not...

21:10.268 --> 21:13.170
Look, there's no way
to put this delicately.

21:15.273 --> 21:18.275
She slept with a lot of people, Norman.

21:18.342 --> 21:19.843
A lot of those people were not nice.

21:19.911 --> 21:22.112
Why are you telling me this?

21:22.180 --> 21:27.050
Because I'm wondering, did
you ever sleep with her?

21:27.151 --> 21:29.920
No. No, I never slept with her.

21:29.987 --> 21:31.788
Norman, you can tell me.

21:31.889 --> 21:34.257
- In fact, you have to tell...
- No, I didn't do anything.

21:34.358 --> 21:36.126
She was... she was a nice person.

21:36.194 --> 21:38.228
She was just looking after me. That's all.

21:38.329 --> 21:40.096
You're not doing yourself any good here.

21:40.198 --> 21:43.166
- Why are you asking me this?
- Norman.

21:43.267 --> 21:44.701
Norman.

21:44.802 --> 21:47.304
This isn't just gonna go away. Norman!

21:47.371 --> 21:50.373
I don't know what you're talking about.

22:25.209 --> 22:29.079
I'm Nick Ford. I need to see your mother.

22:29.180 --> 22:32.082
She's in town right now, but
she should be back shortly.

22:32.183 --> 22:36.620
You mind if I wait inside? It's important.

22:36.687 --> 22:38.688
Okay.

22:42.927 --> 22:45.929
You can... You can sit over there.

22:59.677 --> 23:01.077
You were the one taking pictures of me

23:01.145 --> 23:04.848
at my daughter's grave.

23:04.949 --> 23:06.650
Ms. Watson was your daughter?

23:06.751 --> 23:10.186
Yeah.

23:10.254 --> 23:13.890
Why were you taking pictures of me?

23:13.991 --> 23:15.225
Because she was my teacher,

23:15.326 --> 23:20.096
and I was very upset about her death.

23:20.164 --> 23:22.999
You see, I heard her having an argument,

23:23.067 --> 23:24.901
you know, the day before it happened

23:24.969 --> 23:26.236
with someone named Eric

23:26.337 --> 23:28.338
and thought that you
might be him, you know.

23:28.439 --> 23:30.206
Maybe this Eric person
was the one who killed her,

23:30.308 --> 23:32.676
- so I...
- No.

23:32.777 --> 23:35.679
No, Eric was my business manager.

23:35.780 --> 23:39.883
I thought if I cut her
off, she'd come back.

23:39.984 --> 23:43.253
She and I'd had a falling
out six months earlier.

23:45.156 --> 23:49.259
I was trying to get her to come home.

23:50.728 --> 23:53.730
I'm sorry.

23:57.168 --> 23:59.536
Looks like you and your
mother are very close.

23:59.637 --> 24:02.872
Yeah. Yes, we are.

24:02.974 --> 24:04.274
We always have been, anyway.

24:04.375 --> 24:06.710
There's nothing more important.

24:10.982 --> 24:12.182
Hi, mom.

24:12.283 --> 24:15.285
Nick Ford, he just came by to see you.

24:20.124 --> 24:22.626
Uh, go put this

24:22.727 --> 24:26.196
in the kitchen, please.

24:26.297 --> 24:29.833
It's okay, just put the stuff away.

24:40.678 --> 24:42.946
I-I couldn't find Dylan.

24:43.047 --> 24:45.248
- He won't talk to me.
- I thought I told you...

24:45.316 --> 24:47.817
And I told you I can't find him.

24:47.918 --> 24:52.689
Norma, you're not being smart here.

24:52.757 --> 24:54.891
How dare you?

24:54.959 --> 24:56.893
How dare you give me orders,

24:56.961 --> 24:58.561
come into my house when I'm not here,

24:58.663 --> 25:00.964
act like somehow I'm beholden to you?

25:01.032 --> 25:02.532
That's because you are.

25:02.600 --> 25:04.768
You're just too ignorant to realize it.

25:04.869 --> 25:06.836
Who do you think got you that seat

25:06.937 --> 25:10.173
on the City Council?

25:10.241 --> 25:13.543
And what do you think
happened to Lee Berman?

25:13.644 --> 25:16.746
You are beholden to me.

25:19.250 --> 25:21.117
No, I don't believe you.

25:21.218 --> 25:22.886
You're just saying this to make me

25:22.953 --> 25:24.020
do something that I'm not going to do.

25:24.121 --> 25:25.622
I don't want him talking to you.

25:25.690 --> 25:27.290
I don't like you, I don't trust you.

25:27.391 --> 25:29.559
And I want you out of my house now.

25:29.660 --> 25:30.927
Do I need to call Sheriff Romero?

25:31.028 --> 25:34.030
He's a personal friend of mine.

25:38.402 --> 25:41.137
You're making a horrible mistake.

26:01.025 --> 26:04.074
Norman?

26:08.079 --> 26:09.513
Norman.

26:09.614 --> 26:10.981
What? I heard you.

26:11.082 --> 26:13.183
Okay, but you didn't answer.

26:14.886 --> 26:18.522
I'm gonna meet someone for dinner.

26:18.623 --> 26:20.891
Okay.

26:22.527 --> 26:23.994
- Norman.
- What?

26:24.095 --> 26:25.862
Norman, enough.

26:25.963 --> 26:27.931
I know you're upset at
me, but it's not my fault.

26:28.032 --> 26:30.033
- You have to trust me on this.
- No, I'm fine.

26:30.134 --> 26:33.937
Okay.

26:34.038 --> 26:36.773
I'm meeting George for dinner.

26:36.874 --> 26:41.378
He seems nice. Have fun.

26:41.479 --> 26:43.580
Well, I don't know how long I'm gonna be.

26:43.681 --> 26:46.783
I'll probably be very late.

26:46.884 --> 26:50.020
I won't wait up.

27:10.708 --> 27:12.743
Hello?

27:12.844 --> 27:15.912
I heard you want to talk to me.

27:16.013 --> 27:17.581
I do.

27:17.682 --> 27:19.416
Can you come by my house later?

27:19.517 --> 27:22.052
No. No, I can meet you someplace public.

27:22.153 --> 27:24.421
That way I know you can't shoot me,

27:24.522 --> 27:25.922
and I can't be spotted with you,

27:26.023 --> 27:27.057
so it's gonna have to be someplace

27:27.158 --> 27:29.326
outside of White Pine Bay.

27:29.427 --> 27:32.496
There's a pizza place
in Downtown Oceanview.

27:32.597 --> 27:34.664
I'll meet you there at 8:00 P.M.

27:34.766 --> 27:36.633
I'll see you then.

27:56.921 --> 27:57.921
Hi.

27:58.022 --> 27:59.556
Hi.

27:59.657 --> 28:02.292
You look beautiful.

28:02.393 --> 28:04.895
I just put dinner on. Hope you like steak.

28:04.996 --> 28:06.296
Who doesn't?

28:06.397 --> 28:07.697
Come on in.

28:09.767 --> 28:11.468
I learned how to really
grill a steak in Austin

28:11.569 --> 28:14.471
when I worked on a ranch one summer.

28:14.572 --> 28:16.506
Really, what'd you do?

28:16.607 --> 28:18.008
I was a ranch hand.

28:18.109 --> 28:20.377
Been at Brown for two years

28:20.478 --> 28:21.978
and just got a little fed up

28:22.079 --> 28:23.914
with the lifestyle of the privileged.

28:24.015 --> 28:25.949
So I applied for a job that
I didn't know how to do,

28:26.050 --> 28:27.617
and I faked it.

28:27.718 --> 28:30.821
Got thrown off a horse.

28:34.025 --> 28:36.693
You okay?

28:36.794 --> 28:39.729
Yeah.

28:39.831 --> 28:42.365
What's Brown?

28:42.466 --> 28:45.001
That's a university back east.

28:45.102 --> 28:47.404
Oh, right. Yeah, yeah.

28:47.505 --> 28:51.041
- Where'd you go again?
- Florida.

28:51.142 --> 28:54.044
Wait, didn't you say you
went to Arizona state?

28:54.145 --> 28:56.146
Did you transfer?

29:00.685 --> 29:03.286
I think this was a mistake.

29:03.387 --> 29:05.422
What do you mean this was a mistake?

29:05.523 --> 29:07.691
Norma, dinner's ready.

29:07.792 --> 29:09.893
Look, I'm not who you think I am.

29:09.994 --> 29:12.362
- What are you talking about?
- I didn't transfer.

29:12.463 --> 29:14.664
I didn't even go to
college. I lied about it.

29:14.765 --> 29:16.833
I barely finished high school.

29:16.934 --> 29:19.002
My husband didn't own an insurance company,

29:19.103 --> 29:21.371
and my family was a mess.

29:21.472 --> 29:24.774
I'm not educated or polished or nice.

29:24.876 --> 29:26.977
I'm nothin'.

29:27.078 --> 29:29.079
I don't have dinners with men like you

29:29.180 --> 29:30.547
in houses like this,

29:30.648 --> 29:31.781
and no one cooks me filet mignon.

29:31.883 --> 29:33.850
- I got to go.
- What about dinner?

29:33.951 --> 29:36.953
I know. I'm sorry.

29:44.629 --> 29:47.697
Norman...

30:16.060 --> 30:17.694
Okay.

30:17.795 --> 30:19.863
Here I am. Talk.

30:21.232 --> 30:23.466
For future reference, Dylan,

30:23.567 --> 30:27.704
in business, as in life in general,

30:27.805 --> 30:29.072
pleasantries are an important part

30:29.173 --> 30:31.374
of how people communicate.

30:31.475 --> 30:34.878
It helps us to find common ground,

30:34.979 --> 30:39.115
but I sense you're not
comfortable being here,

30:39.216 --> 30:42.319
maybe even a little out of your depth.

30:42.420 --> 30:43.987
So we'll skip past that part today

30:44.088 --> 30:47.590
and get right to our mutual problem.

30:47.692 --> 30:48.892
What's that?

30:48.993 --> 30:50.794
Zane Morgan.

30:50.895 --> 30:53.096
What about him?

30:53.197 --> 30:54.898
You can find him.

30:54.999 --> 30:58.401
You can get to him, and
you can take him out.

30:58.502 --> 31:02.706
You do that, and this all stops right here.

31:07.545 --> 31:10.046
You're asking me to kill Zane.

31:10.147 --> 31:12.349
I'm not asking you.

31:12.450 --> 31:16.019
You need to do it.

31:16.120 --> 31:17.954
You don't start a drug war

31:18.055 --> 31:20.724
unless you're prepared for a slaughter

31:20.825 --> 31:24.494
down to the last man standing.

31:24.595 --> 31:26.730
Are you prepared for that?

31:30.468 --> 31:32.769
Is your family?

31:32.870 --> 31:37.107
'Cause that's what's
going to rain down on you.

31:39.844 --> 31:41.845
We're done talking.

31:47.885 --> 31:50.687
And stay the hell away from my mother...

31:50.788 --> 31:53.923
Or I will kill you.

32:14.959 --> 32:16.226
What are you doing?

32:16.327 --> 32:18.495
Jury just came back.

32:18.596 --> 32:21.198
Kyle Miller's been convicted
of the murder of Blaire Watson.

32:21.299 --> 32:24.034
I thought you might like to know.

32:24.135 --> 32:27.404
Uh-huh.

32:27.505 --> 32:29.840
- So what does that mean?
- What do we do?

32:29.941 --> 32:31.508
What do we do about what?

32:31.609 --> 32:33.944
About Norman Bates,

32:34.045 --> 32:36.112
and the fact that his semen sample matched,

32:36.214 --> 32:38.448
that he had sex with her the
night that she was killed,

32:38.516 --> 32:40.784
and nobody but us knows about this.

32:40.885 --> 32:42.352
Okay, well, you know,
here's something we could do.

32:42.420 --> 32:44.087
We could prosecute Blaire Watson

32:44.155 --> 32:45.455
for having sex with a minor.

32:45.523 --> 32:49.492
Oh, no. Shit, she's dead.

32:54.899 --> 32:57.200
You, uh...

32:57.301 --> 32:58.902
You tell anyone,

32:58.970 --> 33:00.871
and I'll hang you from the highest tree

33:00.972 --> 33:02.205
for illegally running a sample

33:02.306 --> 33:06.810
through the criminal database.

33:06.911 --> 33:10.013
I gotta go. Thanks for the news.

33:12.250 --> 33:13.350
Doesn't have to be a crown block.

33:13.451 --> 33:14.918
It could be a car backing over him

33:14.986 --> 33:16.820
or he could fall out the upstairs window.

33:16.921 --> 33:18.421
Any little thing like that,
just so it's a morgue job.

33:18.522 --> 33:22.225
- Are you crazy?
- Not that crazy.

33:22.326 --> 33:26.496
- Good-bye, Mrs. Dietrichson.
- What's the matter?

33:26.597 --> 33:30.901
Look, baby. You can't get away with it.

33:31.002 --> 33:33.103
You want to knock him off, don't you?

33:33.204 --> 33:34.404
That's a horrible thing to say.

33:34.472 --> 33:36.239
What'd you think I was, anyway?

33:36.340 --> 33:37.974
The guy that walks into a
good-looking dame's front parlor

33:38.075 --> 33:38.975
and says, "good afternoon,
I sell accident insurance

33:39.076 --> 33:40.410
on husbands."

33:40.511 --> 33:43.847
Norman, we need to talk.

33:43.915 --> 33:47.050
George not feeling well?

33:47.118 --> 33:49.986
Um...

33:53.925 --> 33:56.226
I missed you.

33:56.294 --> 33:59.095
That's sort of silly.
We just saw each other.

33:59.196 --> 34:01.364
- Norman, stop it.
- Stop what?

34:01.465 --> 34:02.999
I know what you're doing.

34:03.100 --> 34:04.801
I'm watching a movie.

34:04.902 --> 34:06.169
Yeah, the movie that you said

34:06.270 --> 34:07.804
you'd seen a hundred times

34:07.905 --> 34:09.272
that I wanted to go to with you.

34:09.373 --> 34:10.840
Well, we have seen it a hundred times.

34:10.942 --> 34:13.810
I still enjoy it.

34:13.911 --> 34:16.478
Sometimes it's just nice to
watch a movie alone, you know?

34:16.580 --> 34:18.882
You're being a dick about
something that isn't my fault.

34:18.949 --> 34:20.083
I'm just watching a movie.

34:20.184 --> 34:22.385
Movie's over.

34:22.485 --> 34:25.088
- That was childish.
- Norman, stop it.

34:25.188 --> 34:26.489
Stop. I don't like you this way.

34:26.590 --> 34:28.158
And what way is that?

34:28.225 --> 34:29.458
All distant,

34:29.560 --> 34:30.893
like you couldn't be bothered with me.

34:30.962 --> 34:32.795
You mean like I'm my own person?

34:32.862 --> 34:35.498
Like we're different? Like
I have secrets from you?

34:35.599 --> 34:38.068
Don't you walk away from me!

34:38.135 --> 34:39.335
You're being ridiculous.

34:39.402 --> 34:41.237
Am I?

34:41.339 --> 34:44.474
Norman, please.

34:44.574 --> 34:46.309
Oh, I see. The anger didn't work.

34:46.409 --> 34:47.777
Now the tears.

34:47.844 --> 34:51.246
- Norman, you don't understand!
- No, I do understand!

34:51.315 --> 34:54.117
I understand that you're
not who I thought you were.

34:54.217 --> 34:56.152
That we're not what I thought we were.

34:56.253 --> 34:57.887
Yes, we are. Nothing has changed.

34:57.955 --> 34:59.155
Everything has changed.

34:59.256 --> 35:00.523
- You changed the rules.
- What rules?

35:00.624 --> 35:01.992
What are you talking about?

35:02.059 --> 35:04.461
I don't trust you anymore,
and that changes everything.

35:04.528 --> 35:06.196
Okay, it's all up for grabs now.

35:06.297 --> 35:08.064
You no longer know who I am either,

35:08.165 --> 35:09.165
because we're different.

35:09.266 --> 35:11.234
What? Stop it. Stop.

35:11.335 --> 35:12.869
Stop it, Norman.

35:12.970 --> 35:14.938
It was all just a game.

35:15.039 --> 35:18.208
The game was that we were
devoted to each other,

35:18.309 --> 35:20.810
and no one could ever come between us,

35:20.911 --> 35:22.145
that we loved each other more

35:22.246 --> 35:23.346
than anyone could ever love another person.

35:23.447 --> 35:25.548
- But we do love each other.
- Do we?

35:25.616 --> 35:28.184
Do we really, mother?

35:28.252 --> 35:30.487
I'm going to my room.

35:30.588 --> 35:32.222
Don't follow me.

35:32.323 --> 35:33.790
Leave me alone.

35:33.891 --> 35:36.860
You stay out here alone.

35:44.902 --> 35:45.869
Norman!

35:48.506 --> 35:52.509
Norman, unlock the door.

36:00.651 --> 36:02.652
I have the key, mother.

36:04.555 --> 36:08.825
Norman.

36:12.897 --> 36:15.965
Norman!

36:16.033 --> 36:18.868
I won't stay out here!

36:18.936 --> 36:22.238
You want to be alone? Fine, be alone.

36:51.936 --> 36:54.938
Norma, what are you doing?

37:02.880 --> 37:04.380
You came back.

37:04.482 --> 37:07.484
Yeah, I came back.

37:22.967 --> 37:24.534
I've wanted to do this for a long time.

37:24.602 --> 37:26.603
Then do it.

37:52.023 --> 37:54.124
Dylan Massett is here.

37:54.225 --> 37:55.925
It's okay.

37:56.027 --> 37:59.029
Send him in.

38:05.102 --> 38:07.037
Hi.

38:07.138 --> 38:08.571
You want wine?

38:08.672 --> 38:11.074
You got a beer?

38:11.175 --> 38:16.413
Yeah, help yourself.

38:18.082 --> 38:20.417
So, what's going on?

38:20.518 --> 38:22.919
Zane's plan is insane.

38:25.956 --> 38:27.557
Nick Ford's not gonna sell his business

38:27.658 --> 38:29.359
and move to Hawaii.

38:29.460 --> 38:31.327
All right, if we don't
figure out how to stop this,

38:31.429 --> 38:32.862
he's gonna slaughter everybody
who's ever worked for us.

38:32.963 --> 38:35.098
And you know this how?

38:35.199 --> 38:37.834
From your vast experience
here in White Pine Bay?

38:37.935 --> 38:41.838
From common sense.

38:41.939 --> 38:43.973
You can't ignore this and just
hope that it's gonna go away.

38:44.075 --> 38:46.276
- I'm not ignoring anything.
- What are you gonna do?

38:46.377 --> 38:47.477
He's totally out of his mind.

38:47.578 --> 38:49.245
All right, you have to stop him.

38:49.346 --> 38:51.915
You're the only one that
has the power to do it.

38:52.016 --> 38:54.350
My life's at stake here too.

38:59.557 --> 39:03.359
You can leave now.

39:03.461 --> 39:08.531
You aren't walking away from this.

39:10.367 --> 39:14.370
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

39:30.020 --> 39:34.524
If you need to do something about Zane,

39:34.625 --> 39:37.627
you can do it.

40:20.671 --> 40:22.906
Norman.

40:23.007 --> 40:24.374
Kyle Miller just got convicted

40:24.475 --> 40:26.042
for the murder of Blaire Watson.

40:26.143 --> 40:27.377
So I gotta know something.

40:27.478 --> 40:29.946
- Why are you lying to me?
- I didn't...

40:30.047 --> 40:31.247
- I didn't lie to you.
- You did.

40:31.348 --> 40:32.315
I know you had sex with Blaire Watson

40:32.416 --> 40:33.616
the night she was murdered.

40:33.717 --> 40:35.118
- But I didn't.
- I don't know why...

40:35.219 --> 40:36.219
Stop, stop. I have evidence.

40:36.320 --> 40:37.554
I have physical proof.

40:37.655 --> 40:39.088
We ran tests on you after the incident

40:39.190 --> 40:40.490
with Cody's dad.

40:40.591 --> 40:42.458
Your DNA matches one of the semen samples

40:42.560 --> 40:44.260
in Blaire Watson from that night.

40:44.361 --> 40:45.929
No, that's impossible, because I...

40:46.030 --> 40:47.063
Maybe you don't want your mother to know,

40:47.164 --> 40:48.565
and I understand that,

40:48.666 --> 40:50.133
but I have to know what
happened that night, Norman.

40:50.234 --> 40:51.935
I have to know why you're lying.

40:52.036 --> 40:54.304
I have to know I didn't
just convict an innocent man,

40:54.405 --> 40:55.538
and if you don't cooperate with me,

40:55.639 --> 40:57.307
I am gonna have to go to your mother,

40:57.408 --> 40:59.042
and tell her everything,
because I need to know

40:59.143 --> 41:01.144
the truth, Norman. Norman!

41:34.612 --> 41:36.613
Mother?

41:52.496 --> 41:54.564
Mother?

42:10.047 --> 42:12.148
Mother?

42:23.369 --> 42:27.233
