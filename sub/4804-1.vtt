01:11.171 --> 01:12.131
More blood!

01:12.251 --> 01:15.211
Great. Keep coming.
Chuck, Terry, pump away.

01:15.371 --> 01:17.251
Don't be stingy.

01:17.411 --> 01:19.291
Watch that arm.
I can see that fake arm.

01:19.451 --> 01:21.011
Chase, keep that claw
really moving.

01:21.171 --> 01:22.971
Jeffrey, jam it on there
just like Freddy would.

01:23.131 --> 01:25.771
Good, good. And cut!
Print that, Gretchen.

01:30.451 --> 01:31.571
Chase, you're a genius.

01:31.691 --> 01:33.891
This makes his old claw look
like Mother Teresa's mitten.

01:34.051 --> 01:36.171
You better thank them.
They're very sensitive.

01:36.291 --> 01:38.091
Chuck, Terry, great blood.

01:38.211 --> 01:40.971
- Thank you very much.
- Some of our best work.

01:41.091 --> 01:42.771
Hey, monkey man,
want to see some neat stuff?

01:44.011 --> 01:45.491
Come on.

01:45.611 --> 01:46.811
It's only make-Believe.

01:46.931 --> 01:48.931
Marianne, I gotta go.

01:54.211 --> 01:55.331
Low bridge.

01:58.291 --> 02:02.051
Let's see if we can
scare the P.J.'S off Mommy.

02:05.011 --> 02:06.131
Hey, Heather.

02:14.811 --> 02:15.931
You hungry, Dylan?

02:22.291 --> 02:23.691
Gotcha.

02:23.811 --> 02:26.091
It should have flexed more.

02:26.251 --> 02:28.691
I think the servos
got shorted out with blood.

02:28.851 --> 02:31.771
Well, take it apart,
pull it out...

02:31.891 --> 02:33.571
and insulate them
with some styro.

02:33.691 --> 02:35.531
The thing wasn't meant to be
submerged, for Pete's sake.

02:37.211 --> 02:38.651
I don't like that thing.

02:38.771 --> 02:40.251
That thing puts bread
on our table.

02:40.371 --> 02:42.211
Is it alive, Daddy?

02:42.331 --> 02:44.971
Heather,
you're in the next shot.

02:45.091 --> 02:48.091
State-Of-The-Art animatronics
with bio-Organic grafting.

02:48.211 --> 02:51.211
Bull tendons, nerve bundles
from a live Doberman.

03:07.091 --> 03:09.851
Must've have picked up a signal
from an eighties walkie-talkie.

03:09.971 --> 03:11.731
- Sure it's off?
- It's off.

03:11.851 --> 03:14.971
Funny, it's warm...
just like a real hand.

03:18.931 --> 03:20.291
Oh, God.

03:23.571 --> 03:25.771
What the hell's going on here?
Cut the effects!

03:32.371 --> 03:35.811
Terry, where is it? Terry!

03:35.931 --> 03:37.451
Chuck, get off me!

03:38.251 --> 03:39.811
Heather, where is it?

03:39.931 --> 03:41.571
Chase, where the hell is it?

03:46.131 --> 03:47.411
Come on.

03:54.291 --> 03:55.531
What the fuck?!

04:09.211 --> 04:10.571
Earthquake. Come on.

04:16.651 --> 04:18.411
Mommy!

04:49.011 --> 04:50.011
What is that?

04:50.971 --> 04:52.651
Car alarms.

04:55.611 --> 04:56.931
You OK?

05:00.171 --> 05:01.291
You OK, chief?

05:03.211 --> 05:04.531
Honey, do you have a fever?

05:04.651 --> 05:05.971
Just another earthquake, Dylan.

05:06.091 --> 05:07.611
Getting kind of fun, huh?

05:07.731 --> 05:09.971
Daddy. Blood.

05:10.091 --> 05:12.211
It's nothing, guys.

05:12.331 --> 05:14.971
It's a scratch. Really.

05:15.091 --> 05:16.571
Where did you get that?

05:16.691 --> 05:18.971
I don't know. Picture, I guess.

05:19.091 --> 05:21.371
When it fell. It's no big deal.

05:21.491 --> 05:23.411
Put a bandage on it.

05:23.531 --> 05:24.811
Don't worry about it.

05:33.011 --> 05:34.091
Geologists at Cal Tech...

05:34.171 --> 05:36.451
have confirmed
this morning's aftershock...

05:36.531 --> 05:37.931
Do we have to watch that?

05:38.051 --> 05:39.371
...five-point-three
on the Richter scale.

05:39.491 --> 05:40.491
Thought you turned it on.

05:40.611 --> 05:42.331
It was strong enough
to cause further collapse...

05:42.451 --> 05:44.691
of the already badly damaged
parking structure...

05:44.811 --> 05:46.411
I'll turn it off.

05:46.531 --> 05:48.811
Officials say
that this is normal...

05:48.931 --> 05:51.051
following a quake
of last week's magnitude...

05:51.171 --> 05:53.771
now thought to be a massive 6.8.

05:55.531 --> 05:58.571
Dylan, this is breakfast,
not arts and crafts.

06:00.451 --> 06:01.611
What?

06:01.731 --> 06:03.571
Did you get any sleep
last night?

06:03.691 --> 06:05.851
More or less.

06:05.971 --> 06:08.771
OK, time to get dressed.
I'm late.

06:08.891 --> 06:10.531
You going away?

06:10.651 --> 06:12.811
Just for a few hours.
Julie will be with you.

06:18.851 --> 06:21.771
Is there anything other than
the obvious bothering you?

06:21.891 --> 06:24.291
I think five earthquakes
in three weeks is enough.

06:26.571 --> 06:28.011
Hasn't been another phone call,
has there?

06:30.411 --> 06:32.491
Good sign.

06:32.611 --> 06:35.771
Two full weeks without him.
Maybe he got hit by a truck.

06:35.891 --> 06:38.411
He's closer, if anything.

06:38.531 --> 06:40.851
It's giving me nightmares,
Chase.

06:41.971 --> 06:43.331
Did you have one last night?

06:45.131 --> 06:47.291
It's just the earthquakes,
Heather.

06:47.411 --> 06:48.771
Maybe.

06:49.971 --> 06:51.931
Maybe I shouldn't do
this interview today.

06:52.051 --> 06:56.971
No. You gotta get back
on the horse sometime.

06:57.091 --> 07:00.251
Look, you had a nut case
making harassing phone calls.

07:00.371 --> 07:01.691
I know how scary that's been.

07:01.811 --> 07:03.571
No, you don't.

07:05.171 --> 07:08.091
OK, I don't.

07:08.211 --> 07:10.491
But it doesn't mean
that it can't be over.

07:10.611 --> 07:12.171
But what if it isn't over?

07:14.451 --> 07:16.251
Maybe you should
tell me your dream.

07:17.971 --> 07:20.011
It was nothing. I was...

07:21.811 --> 07:24.571
you and I were working on
this movie, together for once...

07:24.691 --> 07:28.091
and one of your special effects
went really wrong.

07:28.211 --> 07:32.411
And Chuck and Terry got hurt...

07:32.531 --> 07:33.571
and...

07:34.931 --> 07:36.691
well, your fingers were cut.

07:36.811 --> 07:38.091
Right here?

07:41.491 --> 07:44.451
Heather, you were
probably half awake...

07:44.571 --> 07:46.491
and saw my fingers get nicked
when the mirror fell.

07:46.611 --> 07:48.131
Dreams are like that.

07:52.331 --> 07:55.971
Look, if you don't want me
to go on this job, I won't.

07:58.251 --> 07:59.931
Just be careful, OK?

08:00.051 --> 08:02.611
I think I can survive
two days in Palm Springs...

08:02.731 --> 08:05.491
supplying soap bubbles
for a detergent commercial.

08:05.611 --> 08:06.611
I guess so.

08:06.731 --> 08:07.851
You guess so?

08:08.731 --> 08:09.771
Come here.

08:19.211 --> 08:20.691
Forty-eight hours.

08:22.131 --> 08:23.731
I'll be back in no time.

08:24.811 --> 08:25.971
I gotta go.

08:35.051 --> 08:36.491
I love what you've done
with the place.

08:37.931 --> 08:39.051
Knock 'em dead.

08:42.611 --> 08:44.731
Dylan, I gotta go.
Take care of Mommy.

09:08.091 --> 09:09.771
Nancy.

09:17.011 --> 09:19.331
Dylan, I don't want you
watching this.

09:23.091 --> 09:25.091
Dylan, what's wrong?
What's wrong?!

09:25.211 --> 09:26.531
What's happening to you?

09:41.651 --> 09:43.771
One, two...

09:57.011 --> 09:58.251
Freddy's coming for you!

10:11.891 --> 10:14.451
Someone's coming.

10:14.571 --> 10:15.571
What?

10:31.771 --> 10:33.011
Are you OK, honey?

10:50.411 --> 10:51.491
Is everything OK?

10:51.651 --> 10:54.411
It's just these quakes.
Did you feel one just now?

10:54.571 --> 10:57.211
No. A big truck went by
before you opened the door.

10:57.371 --> 10:58.971
It's life on the fault line.

10:59.131 --> 11:00.931
- Hey, tiger.
- Hi, Julie.

11:02.331 --> 11:05.371
Does he feel warm to you?
He had a fever this morning.

11:07.291 --> 11:08.491
No, he seems OK.

11:10.011 --> 11:11.571
Are you sure
that's all that's wrong?

11:14.651 --> 11:16.691
Leave us alone,
you son of a bitch!

11:16.851 --> 11:18.411
L.A. Limousine, ma'am.

11:18.571 --> 11:20.571
Just wanted you to know
I'm out front.

11:27.771 --> 11:29.931
I'm sorry.
Can you hang on a minute?

11:40.171 --> 11:41.411
What is it?

11:41.571 --> 11:42.571
I don't know.

11:44.091 --> 11:46.011
I just have
this weird feeling today.

11:46.171 --> 11:49.131
Mommy? Stay home, then.

11:55.571 --> 11:57.211
This damn caller.

11:59.931 --> 12:01.051
He's started again?

12:02.731 --> 12:04.371
Sick fuck.

12:05.531 --> 12:06.531
Sorry.

12:08.531 --> 12:11.331
Dylan doesn't seem
to have a fever.

12:11.451 --> 12:13.691
It's probably just your nerves.

12:13.851 --> 12:15.251
Nerves?

12:16.451 --> 12:19.171
I just meant from the shaker
this morning.

12:19.291 --> 12:21.411
Everybody's freaked out about
how many we've been having.

12:21.531 --> 12:23.011
And then these phone calls.

12:27.811 --> 12:28.931
Don't answer it.

12:37.691 --> 12:40.891
Excuse me, ma'am,
but we are going to be late.

12:52.371 --> 12:56.491
Dylan, I gotta go. Forgive me?

12:56.651 --> 12:57.771
Bye.

13:11.771 --> 13:13.411
I'll call the cops for you.

13:13.531 --> 13:14.651
You've got the number
on the fridge, right?

13:14.811 --> 13:16.291
Give them
the time they called...

13:16.411 --> 13:18.771
and they're keeping this list,
supposedly.

13:18.931 --> 13:21.371
Julie, I'm really sorry.

13:21.531 --> 13:23.331
My nerves are
a little raw these days.

13:23.451 --> 13:24.491
It's OK.

13:31.571 --> 13:32.771
Yeah. I gotta go.

13:32.891 --> 13:34.771
- Morning.
- Good morning.

13:49.691 --> 13:50.731
You played that girl.

13:52.491 --> 13:54.211
In that movie.

13:54.331 --> 13:55.691
With the guy with the...

13:56.891 --> 13:59.731
Yeah, sure. That's you.

13:59.851 --> 14:01.891
That's what I love
about this job.

14:02.011 --> 14:03.491
I get to meet the stars.

14:03.611 --> 14:05.571
I'm hardly a star.

14:05.691 --> 14:07.291
What, are you kidding?

14:07.411 --> 14:09.331
I love your stuff.

14:10.651 --> 14:11.931
The first was the best.

14:12.611 --> 14:15.491
Where the girlfriend's cut open
and dragged across the ceiling.

14:15.611 --> 14:16.611
It was awesome.

14:16.731 --> 14:20.451
And when all that blood comes
out of your boyfriend's bed?

14:20.571 --> 14:22.211
I thought I'd shit.

14:22.331 --> 14:24.771
But they never should
have killed off Freddy.

14:25.931 --> 14:27.451
Heather, look, we gotta go.

14:27.571 --> 14:30.851
Cutting it close, aren't you?
You trying to get me fired?

14:30.971 --> 14:32.331
OK! We're coming!

14:35.411 --> 14:37.931
So, Heather, we're approaching
the tenth anniversary...

14:38.051 --> 14:39.531
of this whole
"Nightmare on Elm Street" thing.

14:39.651 --> 14:42.891
I mean, the original,
five very popular sequels.

14:43.011 --> 14:46.811
How has all the success
affected you personally?

14:47.931 --> 14:50.371
I don't know
if it really has, Sam.

14:50.491 --> 14:52.531
God. With the exception
of One and Three...

14:52.651 --> 14:54.331
I pretty much stayed out of it.

14:54.451 --> 14:56.371
Well, I'm doing a lot more
television now...

14:56.491 --> 14:58.211
so those hours
let me spend a lot more time...

14:58.331 --> 14:59.491
with my husband
and my little boy.

14:59.611 --> 15:01.731
You have a little boy.
What's his name?

15:02.971 --> 15:03.971
Dylan.

15:04.091 --> 15:06.611
With Dylan,
does that change your feeling...

15:06.731 --> 15:08.771
your perspective
about horror movies?

15:08.891 --> 15:10.451
No, not really.

15:10.571 --> 15:12.331
Would you let him
see one of your movies?

15:12.451 --> 15:14.371
My son? No.

15:14.491 --> 15:16.691
I'm sure people ask you this
all the time...

15:16.811 --> 15:19.011
Is there going
to be another sequel...

15:19.131 --> 15:22.571
and what's more,
is Freddy really dead?

15:22.691 --> 15:25.211
Of course he is.
Freddy's dead and gone.

15:25.331 --> 15:28.771
And how about your co-Star
in the original...

15:28.891 --> 15:31.091
would you trust him
alone with Dylan?

15:31.211 --> 15:33.731
Robert? I don't know.

15:33.851 --> 15:35.851
Why don't we ask him
how he'd feel about it?

15:35.971 --> 15:39.211
We've got a big surprise for you
and for our audience.

15:39.331 --> 15:41.211
Let's bring him out.
He is the best of the bad.

15:41.331 --> 15:44.131
Let's say hello
to Robert Englund.

15:53.371 --> 15:55.491
Love ya, babe!

15:55.611 --> 15:57.011
We'll do lunch!

16:00.611 --> 16:03.491
I'm alive once again!

16:03.611 --> 16:07.571
Freddy's back! Give it up
for your Uncle Freddy!

16:08.891 --> 16:12.091
Just when you thought it was
safe to get back into bed!

16:15.571 --> 16:16.691
Give me five!

16:21.051 --> 16:24.611
I'm back,
and I'm badder than ever!

16:28.451 --> 16:31.931
You are all my children now!

16:38.331 --> 16:39.491
I got to go, Robert.

16:39.611 --> 16:42.051
Just a second. I'll walk you.

16:42.171 --> 16:43.531
There you go, kids.

16:43.651 --> 16:45.131
- Thank you.
- Bye-Bye.

16:46.531 --> 16:48.411
- You OK?
- I'm fine.

16:48.531 --> 16:50.891
Well, everything went great,
I thought.

16:51.011 --> 16:52.611
We really got you, didn't we?

16:52.731 --> 16:54.531
I don't know why
you didn't tell me.

16:54.651 --> 16:57.731
Come on. They loved
the expression on your face.

16:57.851 --> 16:59.171
I think they'd like
to see us together again.

16:59.291 --> 17:01.211
In what, a romantic comedy?

17:01.331 --> 17:02.651
Just because
it's a love story...

17:02.771 --> 17:05.570
doesn't mean you can't
have a decapitation or two.

17:05.691 --> 17:08.491
- There's a call for you.
- For me?

17:08.611 --> 17:09.971
I'll talk to you later.

17:13.050 --> 17:15.891
Heather, it's Sara Risher
over at New Line Cinema.

17:16.011 --> 17:17.211
How are you?

17:17.330 --> 17:19.851
How are you?
This is a voice from the past.

17:19.971 --> 17:20.971
It sure is.

17:21.090 --> 17:23.090
Listen, Heather,
I won't take but a minute.

17:23.211 --> 17:25.451
It's just that we have
something to propose to you...

17:25.570 --> 17:27.491
and I wonder
if you'd stop by the offices.

17:27.611 --> 17:29.371
Bob would love to talk to you.

17:29.491 --> 17:30.531
Sure. When?

17:30.651 --> 17:33.131
No time like the present.
The car will bring you over.

17:33.251 --> 17:34.851
- Now?
-Just take a minute.

17:34.971 --> 17:37.371
You'll be glad you did, I bet.
Bye.

18:01.051 --> 18:03.571
- Can I help you?
- I'm here to see Bob Shaye.

18:03.691 --> 18:05.171
Was Bob expecting you?

18:06.891 --> 18:08.051
Sara. How are you?

18:08.171 --> 18:10.371
- I'm fine. How are you?
- Great to see you.

18:10.491 --> 18:12.291
- You look great.
- Thank you.

18:12.411 --> 18:15.331
Bob is dying to see you.
Can I get you something?

18:15.451 --> 18:17.011
- Coffee would be fine.
- Black?

18:17.131 --> 18:19.011
- Black's fine.
- Could you get us some coffee?

18:19.131 --> 18:20.331
- Sure.
- Thanks.

18:20.451 --> 18:22.731
I think the guy
is a little bit of a jerk...

18:22.851 --> 18:24.931
but we won't know
until we've read the script.

18:25.051 --> 18:26.931
Anyhow, I'll give you a call
when I...

18:27.051 --> 18:29.891
Listen, man, I got to go.

18:30.011 --> 18:31.051
Call me
when you get to Milan...

18:31.171 --> 18:33.211
and don't forget...
risotto con tartufi.

18:33.331 --> 18:34.331
It's fantastico!

18:34.451 --> 18:36.571
Take care, man.
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

18:36.691 --> 18:39.491
Boy, do you look great, Heather.

18:39.611 --> 18:42.651
- How are you?
- Great. I'm fine.

18:42.771 --> 18:44.651
And I don't have to ask
how you're doing.

18:44.771 --> 18:46.411
Well, so far so good.

18:46.531 --> 18:49.131
Which is why we asked you
to come by today.

18:49.251 --> 18:51.331
- Thanks, Kim.
- Sure.

18:53.611 --> 18:55.691
Look, Heather,
let me cut to the chase.

18:55.811 --> 18:59.651
How would you like to join us
in the definitive "Nightmare"?

19:00.611 --> 19:02.771
I thought you killed Freddy off.

19:02.891 --> 19:05.731
Well, we did, but the fans...

19:05.851 --> 19:08.611
God bless them,
they're clamouring for more.

19:08.731 --> 19:10.851
I guess evil never dies, right?

19:10.971 --> 19:12.811
Anyhow, a few weeks ago,
I got a call from Wes...

19:12.931 --> 19:14.851
and he pitched me
this really ex citing idea...

19:14.971 --> 19:16.171
and I started thinking...

19:16.291 --> 19:19.011
"who better to resurrect
Freddy than his creator?"

19:19.131 --> 19:21.691
I thought Wes stopped
doing horror movies.

19:21.811 --> 19:24.971
He actually told me he hadn't
called in the last ten years...

19:25.091 --> 19:28.251
because he hadn't had
any really scary nightmares.

19:28.371 --> 19:30.931
They're his inspiration
for this thing.

19:31.051 --> 19:34.051
Anyhow, he's right
in the middle of the script.

19:34.171 --> 19:36.451
Which means
he's having nightmares again.

19:36.571 --> 19:38.211
He's very excited about it.

19:38.331 --> 19:40.371
- The nightmares?
- No, the script.

19:41.251 --> 19:44.971
And you should be, too,
because you're the star.

19:46.971 --> 19:48.371
I don't know, Bob.

19:48.491 --> 19:52.411
I'm flattered, really,
but I have a kid now.

19:52.531 --> 19:53.771
Well, so?

19:53.891 --> 19:56.851
So I'm not sure
about doing horror.

19:56.971 --> 19:58.971
Come on, Heather.
Kids love horror.

20:00.811 --> 20:02.611
Thank you so much, Bob.

20:04.251 --> 20:05.771
I have other things happening.

20:05.891 --> 20:09.211
Look, we'll match any offer
that's on the table for you.

20:09.331 --> 20:11.811
No, it's not that.
Look, I have a fan.

20:11.931 --> 20:13.531
Heather, you got plenty of fans.

20:13.651 --> 20:15.211
We've been doing
marketing research on you.

20:15.331 --> 20:17.371
You are rating right up there.

20:17.491 --> 20:19.931
We've got Chase working on
a prototype for the new glove.

20:20.051 --> 20:21.051
What?

20:21.171 --> 20:24.531
We asked him to kind of
keep it as a surprise...

20:24.651 --> 20:27.091
until you and I could have
this conversation.

20:31.131 --> 20:33.211
How long has Wes been
working on this script?

20:33.331 --> 20:36.331
I don't know.
A couple of months. Why?

20:36.451 --> 20:37.851
And since you've been
thinking of making it...

20:37.971 --> 20:39.411
has anything funny happened?

20:40.451 --> 20:41.611
What do you mean?

20:41.731 --> 20:44.211
Like weird phone calls.

20:49.331 --> 20:50.691
Or nightmares.

20:53.451 --> 20:55.811
Why don't you answer
your phone, Bob?

20:56.571 --> 20:59.531
That's what we got people
we pay around here for.

20:59.651 --> 21:01.451
Will someone pick up
the damn phone?

21:17.251 --> 21:18.731
- Thanks a lot.
- You're welcome.

21:33.571 --> 21:34.611
What the...

21:41.531 --> 21:45.291
Never sleep again.

21:52.731 --> 21:54.091
What is going on?

21:54.211 --> 21:56.331
You didn't let him watch
the movie on TV, did you?

21:56.451 --> 21:59.931
Movie? He didn't watch
anything on TV.

22:00.051 --> 22:02.451
He was taking his nap,
and I heard him screaming.

22:05.091 --> 22:06.411
Honey, are you OK?

22:07.931 --> 22:10.171
Rex saved me.

22:16.211 --> 22:17.211
He did?

22:23.571 --> 22:25.531
Is Rex going to die?

22:27.411 --> 22:29.451
Rex is not going to die.

22:29.611 --> 22:31.851
I promise you, sweetie.

22:35.011 --> 22:37.331
Do you know where the sewing
stuff is in the kitchen?

22:37.491 --> 22:39.051
Sure.

22:39.211 --> 22:40.851
We'll do an operation, OK?

22:41.771 --> 22:45.011
Come on.
Dr Dylan and Dr Julie.

22:45.171 --> 22:47.251
Fix him up good as new, OK?

22:57.011 --> 23:00.331
Hey, Chase. You've got a call.
It's your wife.

23:08.611 --> 23:10.091
Chase, you better come home.

23:10.211 --> 23:12.291
Heather, I'm stuck here.

23:12.451 --> 23:14.531
Neither Chuck or Terry
came in today.

23:14.691 --> 23:16.331
Why? What's the matter?

23:16.451 --> 23:19.171
- Chase, it's Dylan.
- What?

23:21.011 --> 23:22.931
Hold on.
The phone's breaking up.

23:24.451 --> 23:27.971
What's going on with Dylan?

23:28.131 --> 23:31.651
He's had some sort
of an episode.

23:31.811 --> 23:33.211
What?

23:33.371 --> 23:34.851
What kind of episode?

23:34.971 --> 23:37.251
He was just acting
very strangely.

23:38.771 --> 23:40.651
Like somebody was after him.

23:40.771 --> 23:42.971
It's scary. It scared me.

23:44.371 --> 23:46.171
He was acting like...

23:46.291 --> 23:47.251
Like what?

23:48.411 --> 23:49.891
Like Freddy.

23:51.451 --> 23:54.651
Heather, has there been
another phone call?

23:56.651 --> 23:59.851
Why didn't you tell me
you were working on a new glove?

23:59.971 --> 24:02.131
And why aren't Chuck and Terry
at work today?

24:02.291 --> 24:04.331
Forget those clowns. Answer me.

24:04.451 --> 24:06.331
Has there been another
phone call today or not?

24:14.331 --> 24:17.211
I'm coming home.
I'll be there in three hours.

24:19.971 --> 24:22.251
- Danny, I got to go.
- What's up?

24:22.411 --> 24:24.371
My kid's sick. I got to fly.

24:42.011 --> 24:43.331
"As soon as the sun was up...

24:43.451 --> 24:46.171
"the witch made Gretel fetch
the wood and kindle a fire.

24:46.291 --> 24:48.011
"'We will bake cookies first,'
she said.

24:48.171 --> 24:50.371
"'I've heated the oven
and kneaded the dough.

24:50.531 --> 24:53.411
"'Crawl in and see if the fire
is blazing high enough now.'

24:53.571 --> 24:55.531
"And she pushed Gretel
toward the oven.

24:55.651 --> 24:58.731
"The witch went to shut the door
and bake her inside."

24:58.851 --> 25:00.331
This is so violent.

25:00.451 --> 25:03.971
I don't know why you like
these stupid old fairy tales.

25:04.131 --> 25:05.491
Finish, please.

25:05.611 --> 25:08.731
- They'll give you nightmares.
- I like this story.

25:11.811 --> 25:14.451
"But Gretel guessed what
the witch was planning.

25:14.571 --> 25:16.171
"'I don't know how to
get in,' Gretel said.

25:16.291 --> 25:17.731
"'How am I to manage it?'

25:17.851 --> 25:20.891
"'Stupid girl,' shouted
the witch, rushing to the oven.

25:21.011 --> 25:24.131
"'The opening is big enough.
See? I can fit myself. '

25:24.251 --> 25:27.331
"Quickly, Gretel came behind
and pushed with all her might...

25:27.451 --> 25:30.091
"plunging the wicked old woman
headlong into the flames...

25:30.211 --> 25:32.211
"banging the door shut
and bolting it tight.

25:32.331 --> 25:35.371
"The witch howled..."
That's enough.

25:35.491 --> 25:38.931
"The witch howled
like a scalded cat...

25:39.051 --> 25:41.931
"but Gretel ran and left her
there to perish nonetheless.

25:42.051 --> 25:43.691
"She ran to her brother
as fast as she could...

25:43.811 --> 25:45.931
"flung open the door.
'Hansel! Hansel,' she cried.

25:46.051 --> 25:48.491
"We're saved!
The witch is dead."

25:52.251 --> 25:54.251
Time for sleep.

25:54.371 --> 25:55.971
Say how they find
their way back home.

25:56.091 --> 25:59.611
- Tomorrow night.
- No. Tonight.

25:59.731 --> 26:01.531
It's important.

26:04.611 --> 26:07.251
Dylan, you know as well as I do.

26:07.371 --> 26:09.771
They followed the trail of
breadcrumbs back to their house.

26:09.891 --> 26:11.651
And then their father
covered them with kisses...

26:11.771 --> 26:12.891
and they were safe.

26:13.011 --> 26:15.731
They were safe,
and they could sleep.

26:19.651 --> 26:22.011
- What is that?
- Rex.

26:24.931 --> 26:26.371
Come on.

26:32.611 --> 26:34.811
Rex keeps him down there.

26:35.971 --> 26:37.131
Who?

26:37.251 --> 26:40.451
The mean old man with the claws.

26:40.571 --> 26:42.331
He wants to come up
while we sleep.

26:42.451 --> 26:44.691
I keep my feet up here.

26:45.891 --> 26:48.331
Rex keeps him down there.

26:50.331 --> 26:51.771
He's my guard.

26:54.971 --> 26:57.091
You should have a guard, too.

27:00.611 --> 27:02.731
There's nothing down there.

27:02.851 --> 27:04.091
Come here.

27:05.731 --> 27:07.731
Look. See?

27:12.771 --> 27:14.971
It's different when you're gone.

27:16.251 --> 27:17.371
Come on.

27:29.611 --> 27:30.811
On, please.

27:31.851 --> 27:32.971
OK, sweetie.

27:36.371 --> 27:38.731
Night-Night. Sleep tight.

27:38.851 --> 27:40.891
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

27:43.051 --> 27:46.371
- Daddy coming home?
- He's on his way.

27:46.491 --> 27:48.811
He can follow
the breadcrumbs, right?

27:48.931 --> 27:50.211
Right.

27:56.531 --> 27:59.371
If the birds
don't eat them first.

28:34.571 --> 28:36.451
Perfect, perfect, perfect!

28:59.331 --> 29:01.851
Come on, come on, come on.

29:03.571 --> 29:06.611
That's me in the corner

29:09.531 --> 29:11.451
That's me in the spot

29:11.571 --> 29:13.971
Light

29:14.091 --> 29:15.171
Light

29:16.251 --> 29:18.811
Losin' my

29:19.971 --> 29:21.171
Religion

29:44.891 --> 29:46.531
Mommy's scared?

29:47.851 --> 29:50.891
Dylan, Mommy's fine.

29:52.011 --> 29:54.411
It was just a bad dream.

29:54.531 --> 29:56.451
What are you doing out of bed?

29:56.571 --> 29:59.571
Rex woke me up.
He was fighting.

29:59.691 --> 30:02.091
Dylan, go back to sleep, honey.

30:02.651 --> 30:04.851
I'm not sleepy.

30:19.451 --> 30:22.171
Police, ma'am.
Will you open the door?

30:35.051 --> 30:36.931
Heather Langenkamp?

30:38.971 --> 30:40.611
Is Chase Porter your husband?

30:44.051 --> 30:45.291
There was an accident.

30:46.371 --> 30:48.571
It appears he fell asleep
while driving, ma'am.

30:50.331 --> 30:52.251
Is he... I mean...

30:53.331 --> 30:54.371
Is he hurt?

30:55.211 --> 30:58.091
I'm afraid
it's worse than that, ma'am.

31:06.691 --> 31:08.611
Is he dead?

31:08.731 --> 31:10.771
Yes, ma'am.

31:15.891 --> 31:17.731
Are you sure it's him?

31:17.851 --> 31:21.051
We have his effects.
You can confirm from that.

31:22.531 --> 31:24.371
I want to see his body.

31:25.091 --> 31:27.851
No, you don't, ma'am.
It's not necessary.

31:28.691 --> 31:30.811
I want to see it for myself.

32:16.291 --> 32:17.931
- Can you hand me that?
- Sure.

32:18.051 --> 32:20.011
Excuse me.

32:20.131 --> 32:22.131
- Could I help you?
- Porter.

32:23.491 --> 32:24.931
Chase Porter.

32:30.091 --> 32:32.091
It's back here.

32:39.971 --> 32:41.371
You said Chase?

32:49.331 --> 32:50.371
I'm sorry.

32:59.651 --> 33:02.651
Just sign here at the bottom.
That's all we need.

33:04.411 --> 33:06.531
I'd like to see once again.

33:06.651 --> 33:07.851
I'm sorry?

33:07.971 --> 33:10.891
Could you lift
the sheet again, please?

33:22.691 --> 33:23.771
More, please.

33:27.171 --> 33:28.611
What is that?

33:28.731 --> 33:30.531
It was a bad wreck, ma'am.

33:30.651 --> 33:33.651
The head's gonna be all right
for the funeral, but...

33:39.691 --> 33:41.171
Hey, lady. You OK?

33:42.331 --> 33:43.531
You sure?

33:50.611 --> 33:53.771
Oh, God. What did that?

33:53.891 --> 33:55.651
They said the truck
was tore up something awful...

33:55.771 --> 33:58.651
so you can imagine him
not being in...

33:58.771 --> 34:00.771
well, exactly top shape.

34:01.771 --> 34:05.131
It looks like he was clawed.

34:08.811 --> 34:12.811
That's why we don't lift
the sheet past the face, ma'am.

34:15.091 --> 34:17.690
Sometimes it's what we don't see
that gets us through the night.

34:25.051 --> 34:27.371
So, if you'll just sign...

34:35.291 --> 34:37.210
God is our hope and strength...

34:37.971 --> 34:40.931
a very present help in trouble.

34:41.091 --> 34:43.531
Therefore, we will not fear...

34:43.690 --> 34:45.531
though the earth be moved...

34:45.690 --> 34:47.610
and though the hills
be carried...

34:47.771 --> 34:50.571
into the midst of the sea...

34:50.690 --> 34:54.130
though the waters thereof
rage and swell...

34:54.291 --> 34:56.931
and though
the mountains shake...

34:57.091 --> 34:59.051
at the tempest of the same.

35:33.571 --> 35:36.451
-Julie, where's Dylan?
- I don't know.

35:50.371 --> 35:54.491
Dylan, grab Mommy's hand.
Grab it!

35:54.611 --> 35:55.651
Oh, my God!

35:57.651 --> 35:59.051
Hurry!

36:04.931 --> 36:08.371
Let go of me!

36:08.531 --> 36:09.731
Stay with me.

36:11.651 --> 36:12.931
Stay with me, Heather.

36:17.291 --> 36:19.491
- Where's Dylan?
- He's all right.

36:19.651 --> 36:20.971
He's right here.

36:24.731 --> 36:27.091
- What happened?
- Earthquake.

36:27.211 --> 36:29.091
You got knocked off your feet.

36:29.211 --> 36:31.771
You got a pretty good bump,
actually.

36:31.891 --> 36:34.251
May he rest in peace, children.

36:34.371 --> 36:37.571
And may you all get home safely.

36:37.691 --> 36:39.251
Amen.

36:54.811 --> 36:57.611
If there's anything
I can do, Heather... anything.

36:57.731 --> 36:59.491
Thank you, Robert.

37:40.171 --> 37:41.171
Sweetie.

37:46.411 --> 37:47.691
Tina?

38:14.731 --> 38:15.931
Who are you?

38:31.731 --> 38:33.011
Baby, wake up.

38:34.251 --> 38:35.451
Honey. Dylan.

38:35.571 --> 38:37.571
Dylan, get over here!
Honey! Honey!

38:40.291 --> 38:41.651
Come on.

38:41.771 --> 38:44.371
OK, sugar, we're gonna
go back to bed now.

38:44.491 --> 38:46.731
No, Mommy, I can't sleep there.

38:46.851 --> 38:49.571
Honey, you have to sleep.

38:49.691 --> 38:55.531
One, two,
Freddy's coming for you!

38:55.651 --> 38:57.451
Where did you hear that?

38:57.571 --> 39:00.971
Did you hear that on that movie?
Did you answer the phone?

39:02.251 --> 39:05.051
Dylan,
where did you hear that song?

39:05.171 --> 39:06.531
In my bed.

39:08.491 --> 39:10.251
In your bed?

39:10.371 --> 39:13.491
Under my covers. Kids singing.

39:13.611 --> 39:16.531
Way down there with the man.

39:16.651 --> 39:18.651
The mean man.

39:21.931 --> 39:23.811
What is that man doing?

39:23.931 --> 39:25.971
Trying to get up.

39:26.091 --> 39:29.011
Trying to get up into our world.

39:58.651 --> 40:00.491
Where's Daddy now?

40:06.611 --> 40:08.131
Daddy's in heaven.

40:10.011 --> 40:11.931
He's with God now.

40:14.851 --> 40:18.931
Do you have to die to see God?

40:19.051 --> 40:20.611
I don't think so.

40:23.931 --> 40:25.531
I think you have to pray.

40:28.491 --> 40:30.131
And reach out.

40:34.851 --> 40:37.971
Why does God let there
be bad things?

40:41.211 --> 40:43.531
I honestly don't know, honey.

40:46.611 --> 40:48.451
Please try to get some sleep.

40:58.171 --> 41:00.611
Can you come with me
in my dreams?

41:04.971 --> 41:07.451
I think that only
happens in the movies.

41:09.771 --> 41:12.811
But I'll always, always...

41:12.931 --> 41:15.051
be right here when you get back.

41:17.171 --> 41:22.691
And I'll make sure
that nobody gets your toes.

42:10.571 --> 42:13.491
I know his behaviour
is bizarre...

42:13.611 --> 42:16.011
but he's usually so normal
and well adjusted, John...

42:16.131 --> 42:17.171
I can't believe it's him...

42:17.291 --> 42:19.971
and not something outside
influencing him.

42:21.131 --> 42:23.291
Or is that how denial works?

42:24.411 --> 42:25.611
It is denial.

42:25.731 --> 42:28.251
I don't think
that's the case here.

42:28.371 --> 42:29.891
If you're really worried
about Dylan...

42:30.011 --> 42:31.851
have a doctor check him out.

42:31.971 --> 42:33.411
You'll see. Everything's fine.

42:33.531 --> 42:37.091
You're not just saying that
to help a crazy friend cope?

42:39.011 --> 42:41.491
Everything about Dylan's
behaviour is understandable...

42:41.611 --> 42:44.571
for a kid
who just lost his father.

42:44.691 --> 42:48.011
How does a child
process a thing like that?

42:48.131 --> 42:49.571
I don't know.

42:51.011 --> 42:53.811
I've not been able
to process it very well myself.

42:53.931 --> 42:56.571
And you're not crazy,
by the way.

42:56.691 --> 43:00.011
Seeing Freddy in that grave
and then jumping in...

43:00.131 --> 43:01.171
you didn't jump in.

43:01.291 --> 43:04.211
That's my memory.
It seemed absolutely real.

43:04.331 --> 43:05.651
"Seemed," not "was."

43:08.771 --> 43:11.531
It's in my family, you know.

43:11.651 --> 43:13.491
What is?

43:13.611 --> 43:16.451
A very close relative
died in an institution.

43:16.571 --> 43:20.651
Really? If having a screwy
family made a person crazy...

43:21.531 --> 43:23.771
the whole world
would be one big loony bin.

43:26.571 --> 43:28.931
You have a crazed fan after you.

43:29.051 --> 43:32.291
That's what's making you crazy.
Probably Dylan, too.

43:32.411 --> 43:33.891
I never mentioned that to him.

43:34.011 --> 43:37.011
Kids know when something's
bugging the parent.

43:38.531 --> 43:41.651
You have no idea
who this is calling?

43:41.771 --> 43:44.251
- Freddy, for all I know.
- Come on.

43:44.931 --> 43:46.331
He's a man.

43:47.491 --> 43:52.251
Or a boy
with a deep Freddy voice.

43:52.371 --> 43:55.611
Six weeks, and you're surprised
you got Freddy in your dreams?

43:55.731 --> 43:57.931
Hell, Sonny Bono,
after a while...

43:58.051 --> 44:01.051
began seeing his stalker
everywhere, even at Mass.

44:01.171 --> 44:02.211
Really?

44:03.171 --> 44:05.731
How many times
did Letterman call the cops...

44:05.851 --> 44:08.251
thinking that woman
was down in the kitchen again?

44:09.651 --> 44:13.411
Really gets under your skin
if you let it.

44:18.131 --> 44:19.731
You really think Dylan's OK?

44:19.851 --> 44:22.971
Dylan's fine. You're fine.

44:23.091 --> 44:24.971
You're hurting,
but you're fine...

44:25.091 --> 44:26.651
and you're definitely not crazy.

44:27.411 --> 44:28.931
My worst fear...

44:29.771 --> 44:33.251
that whatever madness
is in my family I have...

44:43.011 --> 44:44.931
and I've passed it onto Dylan.

45:03.011 --> 45:05.811
- Make sure he's OK, John.
- Are you all right?

45:05.931 --> 45:08.331
Are you OK? Are you sure?
Does anything hurt?

45:08.451 --> 45:10.051
Dylan, are you all right?

45:10.171 --> 45:13.371
Honey, are you all right?
Are you sure?

45:13.491 --> 45:15.731
God wouldn't take me.

45:18.251 --> 45:20.291
Oh, my God. Oh, honey.

45:20.411 --> 45:21.811
It's unbelievable.

46:17.571 --> 46:20.131
- You doing all right?
- Hanging in there.

46:20.291 --> 46:22.171
You know the guy that was
calling me all the time?

46:22.331 --> 46:23.571
He started again...

46:23.731 --> 46:25.531
and he's putting stuff
in my mail again.

46:25.691 --> 46:28.251
Listen, the S.O.B. Probably
read about the funeral...

46:28.371 --> 46:29.571
in the papers or something.

46:29.731 --> 46:31.811
Sick mother.

46:31.971 --> 46:34.371
That's the last thing
you need right now, I'm sure.

46:34.531 --> 46:37.731
Actually, it's been giving me
Freddy nightmares.

46:37.891 --> 46:40.051
Wait a second.
Now, let me get this straight.

46:40.211 --> 46:43.851
You're having nightmares
about Freddy? As in me?

46:44.011 --> 46:47.971
No. It isn't you. He's scarier.

46:49.771 --> 46:50.731
He's...

46:51.651 --> 46:52.691
Darker?

46:53.771 --> 46:54.731
More evil?

46:54.891 --> 46:57.851
Yeah. How did you know?

46:57.971 --> 46:59.771
Call it a guess.

46:59.931 --> 47:01.811
Pretty damn good guess.

47:02.891 --> 47:05.211
Anyway
what I was calling about was...

47:05.371 --> 47:07.491
have you seen any of the script
by any chance?

47:07.651 --> 47:11.091
No. Wes won't show it
until he's finished.

47:11.251 --> 47:12.651
At least that's what he told me.

47:12.811 --> 47:14.011
When is it gonna be done?

47:14.171 --> 47:17.131
The way he's writing, who knows?

47:17.251 --> 47:19.131
It's so weird.

47:19.251 --> 47:20.971
I asked him how far
he was at the funeral.

47:21.091 --> 47:23.211
What did he say? Oh, yeah.

47:23.331 --> 47:26.131
"As far as Dylan
trying to reach God."

47:26.291 --> 47:29.091
Whatever that means. Weird, huh?

47:29.251 --> 47:31.811
Putting your kid in the script.

47:31.931 --> 47:35.891
Robert...
have you been having nightmares?

47:39.971 --> 47:42.251
Look, we need to talk,
but not over the phone.

47:42.371 --> 47:44.251
Can I come over?

47:44.371 --> 47:49.131
Actually, Heather...
today's no good.

47:49.291 --> 47:52.971
There's something
I have to finish.

47:53.131 --> 47:54.411
Tomorrow maybe, huh?

47:54.531 --> 47:57.571
OK, tomorrow.
But early in the morning.

47:57.691 --> 48:00.131
And meanwhile, Robert,
take care, OK?

48:01.131 --> 48:03.411
Yeah. Sure.

50:22.822 --> 50:23.822
Damn it!

50:38.542 --> 50:43.782
One, two,
Freddy's coming for you!

50:52.662 --> 50:56.702
Three, four,
better lock your door

51:00.702 --> 51:04.822
Five, six, grab your crucifix

51:07.942 --> 51:12.102
Seven, eight,
better stay up late

51:13.302 --> 51:16.182
Dylan, don't sing that song.

51:17.822 --> 51:22.022
Nine, ten, never sleep again!

51:25.342 --> 51:27.502
Dylan! Stop it!

51:28.302 --> 51:29.982
No! Don't!

51:34.262 --> 51:36.342
Never sleep again

51:36.462 --> 51:39.982
Never sleep again

51:40.102 --> 51:43.062
Never sleep again

51:43.182 --> 51:45.702
Never sleep again

52:24.782 --> 52:25.822
I touched him.

52:53.862 --> 52:56.062
Any history of epilepsy
in your family?

52:57.582 --> 52:58.622
Diabetes?

53:00.302 --> 53:04.342
Was there a trigger event,
trauma, shock?

53:04.462 --> 53:07.782
You haven't shown him
the films you've made, have you?

53:07.902 --> 53:09.382
The horror stuff?

53:09.502 --> 53:11.822
His father just passed away.

53:11.942 --> 53:13.902
I'm sorry.

53:14.862 --> 53:18.382
But I'm convinced
those films can tip...

53:18.502 --> 53:20.942
an unstable child over the edge.

53:21.062 --> 53:22.182
Unstable?

53:23.182 --> 53:26.182
Dylan's not unstable.
He's just upset.

53:26.302 --> 53:28.742
We'll run a battery of tests
and know in a few days.

53:28.862 --> 53:31.142
Does he have to stay overnight?

53:31.262 --> 53:32.582
Absolutely.

53:38.942 --> 53:41.542
Anything more happen
we need to know about?

53:43.422 --> 53:44.382
Like what?

53:45.182 --> 53:48.782
Sometimes what a child
says or fantasizes...

53:48.902 --> 53:50.982
will give a clue
to what ails him.

53:51.102 --> 53:54.582
Did he say anything
while he was still lucid?

54:10.702 --> 54:12.302
What do we have here?

54:12.422 --> 54:14.782
Too soon to know for sure.

54:14.902 --> 54:17.942
The early symptoms point
to childhood schizophrenia.

54:21.982 --> 54:24.222
Dylan, can you hear me?

54:26.542 --> 54:30.182
Dylan, you have to fight it,
whatever is after you...

54:30.302 --> 54:31.982
and you got to come back to me.

54:32.102 --> 54:34.782
You can't make it alone.
Do you hear?

54:37.502 --> 54:41.062
If you can hear me, tell me
what you need to feel safe.

54:47.702 --> 54:49.982
Rex? Is that what you want?

54:52.222 --> 54:56.902
Well, Rex is at home,
and that's where you should be.

54:57.022 --> 55:00.422
But you got to get better before
they'll let you come home.

55:00.542 --> 55:01.662
Do you understand?

55:03.022 --> 55:04.982
Home.

55:05.102 --> 55:07.702
Home. Home, that's right.

55:07.822 --> 55:09.982
That's where I want you,
sweetie.

55:10.102 --> 55:12.862
And, you know,
we're not that far away.

55:12.982 --> 55:15.822
Look right out there.

55:15.942 --> 55:19.022
Past the freeway is our home.

55:19.142 --> 55:23.942
But to get there, you have to
come out from where you are...

55:24.062 --> 55:27.662
so that they'll let you
come home to Rex.

55:27.782 --> 55:29.062
And to me.

55:30.862 --> 55:32.342
Time for your medicine, cowboy.

55:33.502 --> 55:36.422
- Here you go.
- What is that?

55:36.542 --> 55:38.422
Something to help him sleep.

55:41.902 --> 55:44.822
There you go. It looks good.

55:50.182 --> 55:51.622
There you go.

55:54.822 --> 55:57.182
Good. Good. Attaboy.

55:57.302 --> 55:59.222
Come on,
lie down and take a little nap.

55:59.342 --> 56:01.062
You should get some rest, too.

56:01.182 --> 56:03.342
He's going to be fine.
We're gonna do some tests...

56:03.462 --> 56:04.902
and then
you can come back later.

56:06.302 --> 56:08.862
Can you get
that other side, please?

56:08.982 --> 56:10.782
I grabbed his things.

56:10.902 --> 56:12.942
These are
his favourite pyjamas here.

56:16.462 --> 56:18.262
Honey, I've got to go.

56:18.382 --> 56:19.502
I love you, Dylan.

56:20.542 --> 56:22.062
Remember what I said.

56:24.022 --> 56:25.702
We'll take care of everything.

57:18.062 --> 57:19.462
Wake up, lady!

57:22.742 --> 57:24.142
Don't lose it now!

57:40.062 --> 57:41.542
Seismologists at Cal Tech...

57:41.702 --> 57:43.902
have counted
over 300 temblors so far.

57:44.062 --> 57:46.142
Though most were too faint
for us to feel...

57:46.302 --> 57:48.942
seven have shaken our community
in the last few weeks...

57:49.102 --> 57:50.982
and now scientists
are speculating...

57:51.142 --> 57:54.022
there might be an unknown fault
running beneath Los Angeles...

57:54.182 --> 57:55.302
a fault that could...

58:05.302 --> 58:07.662
Hi. You've reached
the Englund residence.

58:07.822 --> 58:09.022
We're out of town.

58:09.182 --> 58:11.382
You can leave a message
if you wish, but...

58:11.542 --> 58:13.742
we'll be gone for some time.

58:37.622 --> 58:39.422
I wish I could tell you
where the script was going.

58:39.542 --> 58:40.862
The fact is I don't know.

58:40.982 --> 58:45.022
I dream a scene at night,
I write it down in the morning.

58:45.142 --> 58:47.422
Beyond that, your guess is as
good as mine where it's going.

58:47.582 --> 58:49.702
At least tell me
what it's about so far.

58:51.382 --> 58:53.182
- Coffee.
- Thanks.

58:53.302 --> 58:56.022
I can tell you what
the nightmare's about so far.

58:56.142 --> 59:00.102
It's about this entity...
whatever you want to call it.

59:00.222 --> 59:02.782
It's old. It's very old.

59:02.902 --> 59:06.262
It's existed in different forms
in different times.

59:06.382 --> 59:09.182
The only thing that stays
the same is what it lives for.

59:09.342 --> 59:10.822
What is that?

59:10.982 --> 59:12.702
The murder of innocents.

59:13.902 --> 59:17.262
This is still a script
we're talking about, right, Wes?

59:18.902 --> 59:22.742
I sort of think of it
as a nightmare in progress.

59:22.862 --> 59:24.502
In this nightmare in progress...

59:24.622 --> 59:26.422
does this thing
have any weaknesses?

59:26.582 --> 59:28.542
It can be captured sometimes.

59:28.662 --> 59:30.782
Captured? How?

59:30.902 --> 59:32.782
By storytellers, of all things.

59:33.702 --> 59:36.502
Every so often, they imagine
a story good enough...

59:36.662 --> 59:38.462
to sort of catch its essence.

59:38.622 --> 59:41.422
Then, for a while,
it's held prisoner in the story.

59:41.542 --> 59:45.502
- Like the genie in the bottle.
- Exactly.

59:45.622 --> 59:47.662
But the problem comes
when the story dies.

59:47.782 --> 59:48.982
And that can happen
in a lot of ways.

59:49.142 --> 59:50.662
It can get too familiar...

59:50.782 --> 59:53.542
or somebody waters it down
to make it an easier sell...

59:53.662 --> 59:58.022
or maybe it's so upsetting
that it's banned outright.

59:58.142 --> 01:00:00.502
However it happens,
when the story dies...

01:00:00.662 --> 01:00:02.622
the evil is set free.

01:00:02.742 --> 01:00:06.622
You're saying Freddy
is this ancient thing?

01:00:06.742 --> 01:00:09.382
Right. The current version.

01:00:09.502 --> 01:00:12.702
And for ten years, he's been
held captive as Freddy...

01:00:12.822 --> 01:00:15.702
in the "Nightmare on Elm Street"
series, but...

01:00:15.822 --> 01:00:19.942
now that the films have ended,
the genie's out of the bottle.

01:00:20.062 --> 01:00:23.742
That's what the nightmares
are telling me and I'm writing.

01:00:23.902 --> 01:00:28.382
If Freddy's loose in
your script, where's he going?

01:00:28.502 --> 01:00:30.942
Another age? Another form?

01:00:31.102 --> 01:00:34.262
No, that's not what
the dreams have him doing.

01:00:34.382 --> 01:00:35.662
What is he doing?

01:00:36.902 --> 01:00:39.062
He's sort of gotten used
to being Freddy now...

01:00:39.182 --> 01:00:41.542
and he likes
our time and space...

01:00:41.702 --> 01:00:46.182
so he's decided to cross over
out of films into our reality.

01:00:50.262 --> 01:00:52.382
Isn't there somebody
who can stop him?

01:00:52.502 --> 01:00:55.782
Actually there is a person
in the dream...

01:00:55.902 --> 01:00:58.142
sort of a gatekeeper,
so to speak.

01:00:58.262 --> 01:01:00.702
Somebody Freddy has to get by...

01:01:00.862 --> 01:01:03.902
before he can
come into our world.

01:01:04.022 --> 01:01:06.542
That person's you, Heather.

01:01:06.662 --> 01:01:07.862
It's me?

01:01:09.782 --> 01:01:10.942
Why me?

01:01:11.062 --> 01:01:13.582
Dramatically speaking,
it makes perfect sense.

01:01:13.702 --> 01:01:15.182
You played Nancy, after all.

01:01:15.302 --> 01:01:17.422
You were the first
to humiliate him, defeat him.

01:01:17.542 --> 01:01:20.062
That was Nancy. Not me.

01:01:20.182 --> 01:01:22.942
But you gave Nancy her strength.

01:01:23.062 --> 01:01:25.982
So in order to get out,
he's got to come through you.

01:01:26.102 --> 01:01:30.102
He's gonna try to do that
at your most vulnerable points.

01:01:32.022 --> 01:01:33.582
Oh, my God, Wes.

01:01:34.702 --> 01:01:36.022
Did you know?

01:01:37.782 --> 01:01:40.702
It was a script.
It was a dream.

01:01:40.822 --> 01:01:42.822
I didn't know.

01:01:42.942 --> 01:01:45.782
You know damn well
it's more than that now.

01:01:50.742 --> 01:01:52.022
How can we stop him?

01:01:53.782 --> 01:01:55.702
The only way
is to make another movie.

01:01:57.782 --> 01:01:59.742
I swear, I'm gonna stay
by this computer...

01:01:59.862 --> 01:02:02.622
and keep writing until I finish
the script, but...

01:02:02.742 --> 01:02:05.342
when that time comes,
you'll have to make a choice.

01:02:05.462 --> 01:02:06.942
Choice?

01:02:07.062 --> 01:02:08.382
What kind of choice?

01:02:08.502 --> 01:02:11.582
Whether or not you're willing
to play Nancy one last time.

01:02:36.902 --> 01:02:39.662
"Many of the symptoms
of childhood schizophrenia...

01:02:39.782 --> 01:02:41.102
"are duplicated in children...

01:02:41.222 --> 01:02:43.982
"suffering
from sleep deprivation."

01:02:50.262 --> 01:02:53.422
"Sleep deprivation can produce
trance-Like states...

01:02:53.542 --> 01:02:55.502
"mechanical behaviour.

01:02:55.622 --> 01:02:57.302
"The child might..."

01:02:57.422 --> 01:02:59.262
Rex woke me up.

01:02:59.382 --> 01:03:02.422
He was fighting the mean old man
with the claws.

01:03:02.542 --> 01:03:04.742
You have no idea
who this is calling?

01:03:04.862 --> 01:03:06.222
Freddy, for all I know.

01:03:06.342 --> 01:03:07.422
As in me?

01:03:07.542 --> 01:03:10.102
No, it isn't you. He's scarier.

01:03:10.222 --> 01:03:11.902
Darker, more evil?

01:03:12.022 --> 01:03:13.182
How did you know?

01:03:13.302 --> 01:03:17.102
He's decided to cross over,
out of films, into our reality.

01:03:17.222 --> 01:03:20.662
Never sleep again.

01:03:31.662 --> 01:03:35.422
The world of horror films
suffered its own terror today...

01:03:35.542 --> 01:03:38.622
as two of Hollywood's best known
special-Effects technicians...

01:03:38.742 --> 01:03:41.182
were found dead
in a vacant field.

01:03:41.302 --> 01:03:43.422
Terrance Feinstein
and Charles Wilson...

01:03:43.542 --> 01:03:45.142
two special-effects artists...

01:03:45.262 --> 01:03:47.342
reputedly working
on a top-Secret project...

01:03:47.462 --> 01:03:49.502
for the makers of
the Freddy Krueger films...

01:03:49.622 --> 01:03:53.222
were found brutally slashed
to death early this morning.

01:04:01.822 --> 01:04:02.942
Freddy's glove was missing...

01:04:03.062 --> 01:04:05.782
and police are speculating
the murders were the result...

01:04:05.902 --> 01:04:07.102
of a botched theft...

01:04:07.222 --> 01:04:09.982
which apparently took place
two days ago.

01:04:10.102 --> 01:04:12.702
At this point,
the murder weapon has not...

01:04:48.302 --> 01:04:49.582
Oh, God.

01:05:13.782 --> 01:05:14.822
Miss me?

01:05:40.062 --> 01:05:41.702
Nancy.

01:06:08.862 --> 01:06:10.862
There are no visiting hours
this late.

01:06:10.982 --> 01:06:12.022
You must understand.

01:06:12.142 --> 01:06:13.422
No, I don't understand.

01:06:13.542 --> 01:06:15.022
I told you I'm his baby-sitter.

01:06:15.142 --> 01:06:17.222
I'm a close friend
of the family, damn it.

01:06:17.342 --> 01:06:19.422
I just need to see him
for a minute.

01:06:19.582 --> 01:06:20.622
Sixty seconds. Come on.

01:06:20.742 --> 01:06:22.902
You have to understand.
You can't see him.

01:06:25.502 --> 01:06:26.742
What are you doing here?

01:06:28.862 --> 01:06:29.862
I don't know.

01:06:31.182 --> 01:06:33.382
I had this really terrible dream
about Dylan.

01:06:33.542 --> 01:06:35.742
I had to come and see him.

01:06:35.902 --> 01:06:38.342
You must think I'm crazy.

01:06:39.382 --> 01:06:41.062
No, I don't.

01:06:41.222 --> 01:06:42.342
Is he all right?

01:06:42.502 --> 01:06:45.142
I don't know.
They wouldn't let me in.

01:06:45.302 --> 01:06:48.262
There are no evening visiting
hours in intensive care.

01:06:48.422 --> 01:06:49.622
Is he all right?

01:06:49.782 --> 01:06:51.942
Dylan? He's holding well.

01:06:52.102 --> 01:06:53.862
Earlier he had some problems.

01:06:54.022 --> 01:06:56.822
- He's in an oxygen tent now.
- Oh, my God.

01:06:59.622 --> 01:07:02.982
Seems we've had an accident,
Miss Langenkamp. May I?

01:07:05.382 --> 01:07:07.582
Those are nasty cuts.

01:07:07.742 --> 01:07:08.902
How did you get them?

01:07:09.062 --> 01:07:12.102
It happened in the earthquake.

01:07:12.262 --> 01:07:13.302
I fell.

01:07:13.462 --> 01:07:14.862
I need to see Dylan.

01:07:14.982 --> 01:07:18.102
In a moment.
First let's see about you.

01:07:22.182 --> 01:07:26.062
If these had been a few inches
nearer the wrist...

01:07:26.182 --> 01:07:28.462
what did you say
you cut yourself on?

01:07:28.622 --> 01:07:30.902
It was the earthquake.
It was dark. I have no idea.

01:07:31.822 --> 01:07:33.782
But these look quite fresh.

01:07:33.902 --> 01:07:36.542
They are. It happened
in tonight's earthquake.

01:07:38.302 --> 01:07:40.862
It happened just 15 minutes ago.

01:07:41.022 --> 01:07:42.422
You must have felt it.

01:07:45.182 --> 01:07:46.982
Guess we lucked out over here.

01:07:49.502 --> 01:07:51.222
Your son...

01:07:51.382 --> 01:07:54.502
is apparently
terrified of a man...

01:07:54.662 --> 01:07:58.142
someone he thinks
is going to come out of his bed.

01:07:58.302 --> 01:08:01.662
One of the nurses heard him
talking to himself.

01:08:01.782 --> 01:08:04.502
Do you have any idea
who that man is?

01:08:05.982 --> 01:08:08.102
I forgot to bring
his dinosaur Rex.

01:08:08.262 --> 01:08:11.222
He keeps Freddy
from coming up out of his...

01:08:12.542 --> 01:08:13.862
bed.

01:08:14.022 --> 01:08:15.822
The man from your films?

01:08:17.182 --> 01:08:18.301
Freddy Krueger?

01:08:19.301 --> 01:08:20.341
With the claws?

01:08:21.862 --> 01:08:23.421
Is that who he's afraid of?

01:08:28.902 --> 01:08:31.942
You have let your child
see your films, haven't you?

01:08:32.102 --> 01:08:34.381
Every kid knows who Freddy is.

01:08:34.542 --> 01:08:36.341
He's like Santa Claus...

01:08:36.462 --> 01:08:38.102
or King Kong or...

01:08:40.902 --> 01:08:44.102
well, interesting talking
with you, Miss Langenkamp.

01:08:45.862 --> 01:08:47.421
I hope you understand.

01:08:47.542 --> 01:08:50.301
My concerns are simply
for the welfare of your son.

01:09:11.142 --> 01:09:12.182
How's he doing?

01:09:55.582 --> 01:09:56.782
Honey.

01:09:57.676 --> 01:10:00.921
- You shouldn't do that.
- Too late.

01:10:01.177 --> 01:10:05.582
I'm almost there, Heather.

01:10:05.702 --> 01:10:08.182
Almost there.

01:10:13.702 --> 01:10:15.742
Daddy!

01:10:23.942 --> 01:10:26.222
- Doctor!
- Keep her right there.

01:10:26.342 --> 01:10:27.662
We can't hold him much longer.

01:10:27.782 --> 01:10:30.262
Get the full anaesthetic, stat.

01:10:30.382 --> 01:10:31.662
We don't have that here.

01:10:31.782 --> 01:10:34.702
No anaesthetic, you say?
Screw it. I'm going in.

01:10:34.822 --> 01:10:36.862
Little booger's full of
something I don't like.

01:10:37.902 --> 01:10:39.662
Let's get him open,
good and proper.

01:10:39.782 --> 01:10:41.382
Cut this evil out of him.

01:10:46.182 --> 01:10:48.102
- Gloria!
- He's got my baby!

01:10:48.222 --> 01:10:49.982
- Who?
- Freddy!

01:10:50.102 --> 01:10:51.662
Who?
Freddy Krueger or something?

01:10:51.782 --> 01:10:53.582
- What the hell's going on?
- My baby!

01:10:53.702 --> 01:10:55.582
Freddy's got my baby.
He's got my Dylan.

01:10:57.662 --> 01:11:00.582
I suggest you go home
and get some rest.

01:11:00.702 --> 01:11:01.902
Your son is fine.

01:11:02.022 --> 01:11:04.302
He's downstairs
for further testing.

01:11:04.422 --> 01:11:05.622
But he was just here.

01:11:05.742 --> 01:11:09.422
He was here, you fell asleep,
we took him.

01:11:09.542 --> 01:11:11.382
You looked so exhausted...

01:11:11.502 --> 01:11:13.422
frankly,
we didn't want to wake you.

01:11:13.542 --> 01:11:16.302
Besides, the young woman
Julie is with him.

01:11:16.422 --> 01:11:18.382
That's his baby-Sitter, right?

01:11:18.502 --> 01:11:21.142
Believe me. Everything is fine.

01:11:22.582 --> 01:11:24.142
Everything's not fine.

01:11:25.782 --> 01:11:26.822
Damn!

01:11:26.942 --> 01:11:28.022
Call security.

01:11:32.542 --> 01:11:33.782
Security, code yellow.

01:11:33.902 --> 01:11:34.942
Pediatric testing.

01:11:41.222 --> 01:11:43.982
This is a restricted area.
Do you have a pass?

01:11:44.102 --> 01:11:45.102
Screw your pass.

01:11:45.222 --> 01:11:46.502
It's all right.

01:11:46.622 --> 01:11:47.622
Where is he?

01:11:47.742 --> 01:11:49.422
Just stay calm.

01:11:49.542 --> 01:11:50.862
How's her little boy doing?

01:11:50.982 --> 01:11:52.382
He's fine, actually.

01:11:52.502 --> 01:11:54.702
He came around
about ten minutes ago.

01:11:54.822 --> 01:11:58.222
He seems to be suffering
from acute sleep deprivation.

01:11:58.342 --> 01:12:00.622
I don't think
she ever lets him sleep.

01:12:00.742 --> 01:12:01.902
What are you saying?

01:12:02.022 --> 01:12:03.102
Where is he?

01:12:04.542 --> 01:12:07.542
I've got someone here
who wants to see you.

01:12:20.382 --> 01:12:21.582
Are you OK, champ?

01:12:21.702 --> 01:12:23.582
Can we go get Rex now?

01:12:23.702 --> 01:12:25.982
The bad man's getting
awful close.

01:12:26.862 --> 01:12:28.622
I know he is.

01:12:28.742 --> 01:12:31.422
We're gonna go get Rex
right now.

01:12:31.542 --> 01:12:34.062
I'm afraid Dylan should
stay here until we know...

01:12:34.182 --> 01:12:36.582
what's causing these episodes.

01:12:38.742 --> 01:12:40.622
I'm sure you understand.

01:12:43.142 --> 01:12:44.182
Good.

01:12:48.982 --> 01:12:50.622
I'll tell you what.

01:12:50.742 --> 01:12:53.262
I'm gonna go home
and get Rex right now.

01:12:53.382 --> 01:12:55.342
You know that home
isn't far from here, right?

01:12:55.462 --> 01:12:56.982
Right across the freeway.

01:12:57.102 --> 01:12:58.102
That's right.

01:12:58.222 --> 01:12:59.542
I won't be gone long...

01:12:59.662 --> 01:13:02.062
and Julie's gonna stay here
with you.

01:13:02.182 --> 01:13:03.422
Yeah, you bet.

01:13:05.222 --> 01:13:08.342
Hurry up, please. I'm sleepy.

01:13:10.942 --> 01:13:13.582
I promise. Cross my heart.

01:13:13.702 --> 01:13:15.342
But, Dylan...

01:13:15.462 --> 01:13:17.742
until Mommy gets back...

01:13:17.862 --> 01:13:19.462
whatever you do...

01:13:19.582 --> 01:13:20.862
don't fall asleep.

01:13:23.462 --> 01:13:25.822
Julie, don't let him
out of your sight.

01:13:27.542 --> 01:13:30.382
What's going on?
Your hair's turning grey.

01:13:31.942 --> 01:13:34.022
Julie, keep him awake.

01:13:34.942 --> 01:13:36.702
Understand?

01:13:41.582 --> 01:13:44.022
Excuse me, miss.
Would you come with us?

01:13:44.142 --> 01:13:45.742
What? Hey!

01:13:45.862 --> 01:13:47.742
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

01:13:47.862 --> 01:13:49.462
Get your hands off me!

01:13:51.462 --> 01:13:53.902
Do you mind?
What the hell is this?

01:13:54.022 --> 01:13:55.822
Just a quick word...

01:13:55.942 --> 01:13:57.622
for Dylan's sake.

01:14:02.422 --> 01:14:06.382
We've had an ex citing day,
haven't we?

01:14:08.102 --> 01:14:10.382
This one?

01:14:10.502 --> 01:14:12.382
Right there.

01:14:15.702 --> 01:14:17.262
One, two, three.
One, two, three.

01:14:17.382 --> 01:14:18.942
You won.

01:14:29.822 --> 01:14:31.902
Would you mind stepping outside
for one moment?

01:14:32.022 --> 01:14:34.462
As a matter of fact, I would.

01:14:34.582 --> 01:14:35.742
What are you doing?

01:14:35.862 --> 01:14:38.782
It's just a little shot
to see that he sleeps.

01:14:38.902 --> 01:14:40.702
No. His mother
specifically said...

01:14:41.862 --> 01:14:43.582
- I said no.
- Do it.

01:14:46.422 --> 01:14:47.542
All done.

01:14:50.102 --> 01:14:51.102
He'll be asleep soon.

01:14:51.222 --> 01:14:53.822
- Would you let go of my arm?
- You bitch!

01:14:56.262 --> 01:14:58.302
Hey, you can't do that!

01:15:01.702 --> 01:15:05.462
I know what's in that one.
Do you know what's in this one?

01:15:05.582 --> 01:15:08.262
Or what's gonna happen to you
when I stick you with it?

01:15:09.382 --> 01:15:10.982
And I will.

01:15:16.902 --> 01:15:20.182
I want you to stay awake, OK?

01:15:20.302 --> 01:15:23.022
Keep your eyes open for me.
Come on.

01:15:26.542 --> 01:15:29.302
Has there been any use
of recreational drugs...

01:15:29.422 --> 01:15:31.342
in your family?

01:15:31.462 --> 01:15:33.742
Or any history
of mental disturbance?

01:15:34.862 --> 01:15:35.982
What are you asking?

01:15:36.102 --> 01:15:38.502
Please, don't take it wrong.

01:15:38.622 --> 01:15:41.542
If there was,
there's a good chance...

01:15:41.662 --> 01:15:44.262
Dylan could be suffering from
something passed down to him.

01:15:46.102 --> 01:15:49.182
Have you been suffering
from any delusional events?

01:15:55.542 --> 01:15:57.582
This man from your films...

01:15:57.702 --> 01:15:59.582
Freddy Krueger.

01:16:01.062 --> 01:16:02.942
Have you been seeing him?

01:16:10.422 --> 01:16:12.462
Would you get those keys
down here?

01:16:12.582 --> 01:16:14.502
I want you to stay awake.

01:16:14.622 --> 01:16:16.302
Keep your eyes open for me.

01:16:16.422 --> 01:16:18.502
Where's Mommy?

01:16:18.622 --> 01:16:20.142
She'll be back. Now stay awake.

01:16:20.262 --> 01:16:25.422
There are drugs and treatments,
Miss Langenkamp.

01:16:25.542 --> 01:16:27.342
We could...

01:16:27.462 --> 01:16:30.422
put Dylan in foster care
for a short while.

01:16:30.542 --> 01:16:33.382
Just long enough to run
some tests on you.

01:16:33.502 --> 01:16:35.902
Keep your eyes open.
Do that for me, OK?

01:16:36.022 --> 01:16:38.822
Come on. You can stay awake.
Stay awake for me.

01:16:38.942 --> 01:16:40.422
I want you to stay awake.

01:16:40.542 --> 01:16:42.262
Keep your eyes open.

01:16:46.062 --> 01:16:47.902
Dylan, what's the matter?

01:16:50.782 --> 01:16:53.022
Julie, behind you.

01:16:58.822 --> 01:17:01.102
There's nothing there.

01:17:01.222 --> 01:17:03.342
Dylan, what's wrong?

01:17:03.462 --> 01:17:06.662
Dylan, stop it.
You're scaring me.

01:17:11.782 --> 01:17:14.062
I want my son out of here
right now.

01:17:14.742 --> 01:17:16.142
Very well.

01:17:16.262 --> 01:17:18.702
As soon as we can gather
the appropriate papers.

01:17:18.822 --> 01:17:20.422
You don't understand.

01:17:20.542 --> 01:17:22.342
If Dylan falls asleep, then...

01:17:23.902 --> 01:17:25.182
I got it.

01:17:37.222 --> 01:17:38.462
Dylan, get out of here!

01:17:51.302 --> 01:17:53.582
Ever play skin the cat?

01:18:05.222 --> 01:18:06.262
Come on.

01:18:17.782 --> 01:18:18.862
Help me.

01:18:25.742 --> 01:18:27.822
Mom!

01:18:27.982 --> 01:18:31.182
Rex!

01:18:31.342 --> 01:18:32.542
What the hell's going on?

01:18:35.582 --> 01:18:37.342
You can't go in there. No.

01:18:38.382 --> 01:18:39.422
Wait, wait.

01:18:43.942 --> 01:18:46.142
Code yellow
to paediatric testing.

01:18:53.102 --> 01:18:54.942
Where's my son?!

01:18:55.102 --> 01:18:56.102
Where is he?!

01:18:58.222 --> 01:18:59.542
Have you seen my son?

01:18:59.662 --> 01:19:01.702
He was just here.

01:19:01.862 --> 01:19:02.822
The boy.

01:19:02.982 --> 01:19:05.422
No way he's going anywhere.
He's been heavily sedated.

01:19:05.582 --> 01:19:07.382
He doesn't have to be awake
to be on his feet.

01:19:07.502 --> 01:19:09.582
- What?
- He sleepwalks, you idiot.

01:19:09.742 --> 01:19:12.382
He's fully capable of walking
out of this hospital.

01:19:12.542 --> 01:19:13.502
Oh, shit.

01:19:24.982 --> 01:19:27.102
John, it's Heather.
I need your help.

01:19:28.302 --> 01:19:29.622
Why? What happened?

01:19:29.742 --> 01:19:31.222
Dylan's run away
from the hospital.

01:19:31.382 --> 01:19:33.862
I don't know if he's wandering
or headed for the house...

01:19:34.022 --> 01:19:35.262
but I think Freddy's after him.

01:19:35.422 --> 01:19:36.902
I know that sounds crazy, but...

01:19:37.062 --> 01:19:38.702
you're right. That sounds crazy.

01:19:41.022 --> 01:19:42.062
Oh, my God.

01:19:53.022 --> 01:19:55.062
You know that home
isn't far from here, right?

01:19:57.022 --> 01:19:58.502
Right across the freeway.

01:20:37.982 --> 01:20:40.182
Krueger, you bastard!

01:20:41.342 --> 01:20:42.382
Take me!

01:21:14.382 --> 01:21:15.662
Are you OK?

01:21:15.782 --> 01:21:16.742
You OK?

01:21:24.422 --> 01:21:25.702
My son is out here!

01:21:27.982 --> 01:21:30.142
Let me go! Dylan!

01:22:07.622 --> 01:22:11.302
I'm sorry. What happened to you?
Are you all right?

01:22:11.422 --> 01:22:13.142
I'm fine. Have you seen Dylan?

01:22:13.262 --> 01:22:14.862
Take it easy, take it easy.

01:22:14.982 --> 01:22:16.782
Relax. He's right there.
What happened?

01:22:18.982 --> 01:22:20.342
Oh, God.

01:22:21.422 --> 01:22:22.942
What's going on, Heather?

01:22:23.062 --> 01:22:24.582
What in the world happened?

01:22:25.702 --> 01:22:27.662
I know how Chase really died.

01:22:27.782 --> 01:22:30.822
- What do you mean?
- Fred Krueger did it.

01:22:33.582 --> 01:22:35.342
Yeah. Sure.

01:22:45.182 --> 01:22:46.782
You saw him, didn't you?

01:22:46.902 --> 01:22:49.302
Coming for you

01:22:49.422 --> 01:22:51.382
Nancy, let's go outside.

01:22:51.502 --> 01:22:52.822
He'll be all right.

01:22:54.062 --> 01:22:55.742
I'll be right back.

01:23:17.422 --> 01:23:19.222
What the hell is going on,
Nancy?

01:23:20.662 --> 01:23:23.382
Why are you calling me Nancy,
John?

01:23:23.502 --> 01:23:25.502
Why are you calling me John?

01:23:31.302 --> 01:23:32.982
Nancy, pull yourself together...

01:23:33.102 --> 01:23:35.182
before you make yourself
and that kid nuts.

01:23:43.142 --> 01:23:44.662
Would you call Robert?

01:23:45.742 --> 01:23:46.862
Robert Englund.

01:23:48.622 --> 01:23:50.702
- The guy who plays Freddy.
- Freddy who?

01:23:50.822 --> 01:23:52.062
Freddy Krueger.

01:23:54.022 --> 01:23:56.622
Nancy, Freddy's dead.

01:24:01.102 --> 01:24:04.502
Don't start losing it
like your mother did.

01:24:05.582 --> 01:24:07.582
I love you, sweetheart.

01:24:09.622 --> 01:24:10.742
Don't forget that.

01:24:19.422 --> 01:24:21.422
I love you, too...

01:24:21.542 --> 01:24:22.542
Daddy.

01:24:49.582 --> 01:24:52.902
Get yourself some rest,
Nancy, please.

01:25:24.822 --> 01:25:29.822
One, two,
Freddy's coming for you!

01:25:37.982 --> 01:25:39.822
Who's there?

01:25:42.062 --> 01:25:45.062
Listen, Daddy.
I've got a proposition for you.

01:25:45.182 --> 01:25:47.142
I'm gonna get the guy
who did it...

01:25:47.262 --> 01:25:50.022
and I want you to arrest him
when I bring him out, OK?

01:25:50.142 --> 01:25:53.582
Nancy, just tell me who did it.
I'll go get him, baby.

01:25:53.702 --> 01:25:55.302
Fred Krueger did it, Daddy.

01:25:55.422 --> 01:25:56.702
Yeah, sure.

01:26:28.742 --> 01:26:30.822
Dylan's sleeping pills.

01:26:31.782 --> 01:26:34.102
Say how they find
their way back home.

01:26:34.222 --> 01:26:35.622
It's important.

01:26:37.582 --> 01:26:38.622
Breadcrumbs.

01:26:43.742 --> 01:26:44.782
Too late, Heather.

01:26:46.382 --> 01:26:48.182
Too late.

01:27:44.262 --> 01:27:46.102
Join you.

01:27:47.742 --> 01:27:50.182
You've given me a way
to join you.

01:30:23.382 --> 01:30:26.142
Almost there.

01:31:05.862 --> 01:31:08.742
"The more she read,
the more she realized...

01:31:08.862 --> 01:31:12.062
"what she had in her hands
was nothing more or less...

01:31:12.182 --> 01:31:14.222
"than her life itself.

01:31:14.382 --> 01:31:17.182
"That everything she had
experienced and thought...

01:31:17.302 --> 01:31:19.342
"was bound within these pages."

01:31:22.062 --> 01:31:24.262
"There was no movie.

01:31:24.382 --> 01:31:27.342
"There was only... her life."

01:31:29.062 --> 01:31:30.542
It's just me.

01:31:34.982 --> 01:31:37.102
Are you OK? Are you all right?

01:31:37.862 --> 01:31:38.822
Where's the man?

01:31:38.982 --> 01:31:40.462
I don't know.

01:31:40.582 --> 01:31:43.022
He had me,
but then he let me go.

01:31:46.262 --> 01:31:47.902
Meet your maker.

01:31:58.702 --> 01:32:00.502
Pick a pet for the rugrat,
bitch.

01:32:11.702 --> 01:32:13.182
Fuck you!

01:32:16.742 --> 01:32:18.382
Get over there, Dylan!

01:32:39.382 --> 01:32:40.422
Take this!

01:32:52.502 --> 01:32:55.182
Come here, my piggy.
I got some gingerbread for you.

01:33:14.902 --> 01:33:15.902
Gotcha!

01:33:28.662 --> 01:33:31.902
Where's your mommy,
piglet, huh, huh?

01:33:33.462 --> 01:33:37.342
One, two,
Freddy's coming for you!

01:35:10.382 --> 01:35:11.862
Come to papa.

01:35:16.502 --> 01:35:18.102
Gonna eat you up.

01:35:34.702 --> 01:35:36.942
Leave him alone!

01:35:58.102 --> 01:36:00.382
Dylan, get out of there!

01:36:56.262 --> 01:36:57.262
Push!

01:37:23.142 --> 01:37:24.262
Run!

01:37:56.062 --> 01:37:57.102
Are you OK?

01:38:02.822 --> 01:38:04.582
Honey, honey.

01:38:07.662 --> 01:38:09.382
Oh, my God.

01:38:09.502 --> 01:38:12.542
We're saved. The witch is dead.

01:38:12.662 --> 01:38:15.782
And his mother covered him
with kisses, and they were safe.

01:38:27.222 --> 01:38:28.382
"Heather...

01:38:28.502 --> 01:38:31.102
"thanks for having the guts
to play Nancy one last time.

01:38:31.222 --> 01:38:34.542
"At last Freddy's back
where he belongs.

01:38:34.662 --> 01:38:36.462
"Regards, Wes."

01:38:51.502 --> 01:38:53.702
Is it a story?

01:38:53.822 --> 01:38:56.622
Yeah. It's a story.

01:38:56.742 --> 01:38:58.302
Read me some.

01:39:01.142 --> 01:39:04.062
"We open on an old wooden bench.

01:39:04.182 --> 01:39:06.702
"There's fire and tools...

01:39:06.822 --> 01:39:08.862
"and a man's grimy hands...

01:39:08.982 --> 01:39:13.502
"building what soon is revealed
as a gleaming set of claws.

01:39:13.622 --> 01:39:15.782
"And the claws are moving now...

01:39:15.902 --> 01:39:20.662
"as if awakening
from a long and unwanted sleep.

01:39:20.782 --> 01:39:24.502
"Then the man lays one trembling
hand flat upon the table...

01:39:24.622 --> 01:39:28.622
"and with his other
picks up a thick, sharp blade.

01:39:28.742 --> 01:39:33.182
"Behind the lights,
faces watch from the darkness...

01:39:33.302 --> 01:39:37.462
"ready to laugh
or scream in terror."
