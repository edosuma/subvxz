00:58.258 --> 00:59.192
[growls]

01:00.226 --> 01:01.795
[yawns]

01:02.796 --> 01:04.431
Uh, King Ocean Master?

01:04.531 --> 01:05.932
are you really gonna hold

01:06.032 --> 01:07.967
that dramatic pose
the entire time that we wait?

01:08.068 --> 01:12.138
Yes, Vulko!
I need to look very cool
when Aquaman walks in.

01:12.238 --> 01:13.740
Are you sure?

01:13.807 --> 01:15.775
Because the guard
saw him, like 30
minutes ago, ya know.

01:15.875 --> 01:17.977
And if we could meet him
halfway, that would save
us a lot of time and-

01:18.078 --> 01:19.813
Shh, quiet! He's coming!

01:19.913 --> 01:21.948
[clock ticking]

01:22.048 --> 01:23.883
No, you know what,
I think that's
somebody's watch.

01:23.950 --> 01:27.654
Aw, fine, my arms
are getting tired anyway.

01:27.754 --> 01:28.988
Vulko, we're back!

01:29.089 --> 01:31.324
Dang it. I told you, Vulko!

01:31.424 --> 01:33.493
Surprise, Aquaman!

01:33.593 --> 01:38.498
I, Ocean Master,
am king once again!

01:38.598 --> 01:39.499
What?

01:43.570 --> 01:45.238
[choir singing]

01:50.176 --> 01:51.744
That's right, Aquaman!

01:51.811 --> 01:54.981
Since you abandon your kingdom
for an entire year,

01:55.081 --> 01:57.250
the throne defaulted to me!

01:57.317 --> 01:58.985
I am king again!

01:59.085 --> 02:01.354
And as soon
as my powerful armies--

02:01.454 --> 02:03.857
[grunts]

02:03.957 --> 02:07.127
[Atlantean] Aquaman
has defeated King Ocean Master!

02:07.193 --> 02:09.629
Long live King Aquaman!

02:09.696 --> 02:11.097
[deadpan cheering] Yay...

02:11.164 --> 02:14.534
Aw, man, they just finished
my royal portrait.

02:14.634 --> 02:16.202
Oh, brother,
you're telling me.

02:16.302 --> 02:18.505
Gonna have to start
making these simpler.

02:19.973 --> 02:21.875
[sighs] What gives, Vulko?

02:21.975 --> 02:23.676
How were we gone
for an entire year?

02:23.776 --> 02:25.712
It felt like only a day
to take down Mortikov!

02:25.812 --> 02:28.481
Yeah, he buried Outpost Four
under his mine!

02:28.548 --> 02:29.716
We saved them, by the way.

02:29.816 --> 02:32.185
I am innocent! I want lawyer.

02:32.285 --> 02:35.455
Biggest lawyer you have!
Most violent lawyer!

02:36.055 --> 02:37.390
Quiet.

02:37.490 --> 02:39.058
He also created a desert
in the middle of the ocean.

02:39.159 --> 02:43.129
He was controlling the water!
And not in a cool way.

02:43.196 --> 02:45.865
Yeah, we think he did it
with this.

02:45.965 --> 02:49.235
Fascinating! This crystal must
create a super gravity field.

02:49.335 --> 02:50.870
Once Mortikov figured that out,

02:50.970 --> 02:54.374
he was able to displace
the water and power his mine.

02:54.474 --> 02:56.075
So inside the gravity bubble--

02:56.176 --> 03:00.713
Time itself slowed down.
Or something like that.

03:00.813 --> 03:02.081
I don't know.
I'm just spitballing here.

03:02.182 --> 03:03.883
Shockingly accurate guess!

03:03.983 --> 03:06.753
This is exactly
how I do my crimes.

03:06.853 --> 03:09.022
- You heard the man!
- Wait, no.

03:09.088 --> 03:10.089
Take him away!

03:10.190 --> 03:11.591
[guards laughing]

03:11.691 --> 03:12.825
[Mortikov] I will
get you for this!

03:12.892 --> 03:14.928
You won't.

03:15.028 --> 03:16.262
I've read about
a crystal like this,

03:16.362 --> 03:17.764
but I'll need to do
some research

03:17.864 --> 03:19.098
Oh, Topo!

03:20.233 --> 03:21.601
Bring the crystal to my vault

03:21.701 --> 03:23.436
and find me some books
about weird crystals.

03:23.536 --> 03:26.272
I want at least eight.
You're an octopus,
not a uno-pus.

03:26.372 --> 03:27.674
[warbles]

03:27.740 --> 03:29.576
[sighs] It's hard to find
good help these days.

03:29.676 --> 03:31.110
I know what you mean.

03:31.211 --> 03:33.379
My royal advisor keeps letting
my nemesis become king

03:33.446 --> 03:35.915
even though I keep
telling him not to.

03:36.015 --> 03:38.785
[groans] You know
who doesn't have trouble
following orders?

03:38.885 --> 03:41.287
Clams. Literally
do not have brains.

03:41.387 --> 03:42.956
What was I supposed to do?

03:43.056 --> 03:44.958
You weren't here to answer
the challenge of royal combat.

03:45.058 --> 03:47.427
I'll say it in clam
so you can understand.

03:48.728 --> 03:51.731
[Aquaman] Throw...
Ocean Master... in jail.

03:51.798 --> 03:53.299
Oh, Sire, please.

03:53.399 --> 03:54.567
I'm not a clam,

03:54.634 --> 03:56.135
and Ocean Master
has committed no crime!

03:56.236 --> 03:58.938
He's right, Aquaman!
Call off your clams!

03:59.038 --> 04:00.406
Hmm.

04:00.473 --> 04:02.609
Look, I know he's responsible
for war and destruction,

04:02.709 --> 04:05.645
but he was king
and challenging you
to royal combat

04:05.745 --> 04:07.113
is obviously legal.

04:07.213 --> 04:08.982
That's how you became king
in the first place.

04:09.082 --> 04:11.084
Oh, I could throw you both
in jail. Would that help?

04:11.150 --> 04:13.886
No! It would not! Vulko, c'mon!

04:13.953 --> 04:15.722
Ugh. Stupid throne.

04:15.788 --> 04:18.491
Why can't Atlanteans
make a chair that's
comfortable to sit on?

04:18.591 --> 04:21.828
Uh, Atlanteans don't actually
sit on their chairs.

04:21.928 --> 04:24.130
You're supposed to float
an inch above them.

04:24.230 --> 04:25.498
They're for decoration.

04:25.598 --> 04:28.668
Hey, he's letting
his butt touch the throne!

04:28.768 --> 04:29.836
[all laughing]

04:29.936 --> 04:31.571
Uh, no! No, I'm not!

04:31.638 --> 04:33.273
Come on, I'm losing them.

04:33.339 --> 04:35.174
There's gotta be
something Ocean Master did
that's a crime!

04:35.275 --> 04:37.844
Like, um,
stealing your trident?

04:37.944 --> 04:39.679
Yeah, like, for example,
if he did something

04:39.779 --> 04:42.115
like stealing my trident,
then we could put him in jail.

04:42.181 --> 04:44.684
Well, good news!

04:44.784 --> 04:45.852
[laughs maniacally]

04:45.952 --> 04:47.320
You may have the throne,

04:47.420 --> 04:50.023
but I have
your dumb pointy stick!

04:50.123 --> 04:52.425
[laughing maniacally]

04:52.492 --> 04:53.826
[Atlanteans laughing]

04:53.926 --> 04:55.094
Oh, man.

04:55.161 --> 04:57.030
-[angrily] Hmm.
- Classic Ocean Master.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.966
Hey, remember
when Ocean Master was king?

05:00.033 --> 05:01.267
Ha! Yeah...

05:01.334 --> 05:02.502
I wonder what he's doing now.

05:02.602 --> 05:04.170
He's stealing my trident.

05:04.270 --> 05:07.373
Oh, right. Wow, that's pretty
embarrassing for you, huh?

05:07.473 --> 05:08.975
[Atlanteans laughing]

05:09.042 --> 05:11.344
You don't need the trident
to be king.

05:11.444 --> 05:14.714
Perhaps you should just,
I don't know, focus
on managing your kingdom?

05:14.814 --> 05:17.116
How can I manage a kingdom
that's laughing at me?

05:17.183 --> 05:18.885
They don't know you.

05:18.985 --> 05:20.320
And you don't know them.

05:20.386 --> 05:22.055
When they see
who you really are,

05:22.155 --> 05:24.223
they'll fall in love with you
just like I did.

05:24.324 --> 05:25.491
Uh-huh.

05:25.558 --> 05:27.193
or we go get the trident
back right now,

05:27.293 --> 05:29.462
because this makes me
look really bad.

05:29.529 --> 05:30.897
You're overreacting.

05:30.997 --> 05:33.633
Stealing from the king
is a punchable offense.

05:33.700 --> 05:35.168
[Mera] Sorry!
'Fraid he's right.

05:35.234 --> 05:36.803
- Hey!
- Gotta punch him, Vulko.

05:36.869 --> 05:38.137
- It's gotta happen.
- Nice!

05:38.204 --> 05:40.907
I, King Aquaman,
will reclaim my trident,

05:41.007 --> 05:43.142
capture the criminal
Ocean Master,

05:43.209 --> 05:44.677
and throw him into sea jail,

05:44.744 --> 05:47.046
because I'm good at being king.

05:47.146 --> 05:48.414
"King Aquaman, the Good"!

05:48.514 --> 05:51.050
You should put that
on my royal portrait.

05:51.150 --> 05:53.553
[Aquaman] Hey!
Stop erasing my trident!

05:55.855 --> 05:57.990
[people chattering
indistinctly]

05:58.057 --> 05:59.692
Where is he? Where is he?
Where is he?

05:59.759 --> 06:02.328
Calm down, man. It'll be fine.

06:02.395 --> 06:03.496
No, you don't get it.

06:03.563 --> 06:05.064
If we don't find
Ocean Master fast,

06:05.164 --> 06:06.933
I'm going to lose
my kingdom's respect.

06:07.033 --> 06:08.835
[groans] No you won't.

06:08.901 --> 06:10.269
Atlantis loves you!

06:10.370 --> 06:12.004
- Really?
- Yeah, of course they do.

06:12.071 --> 06:14.273
Look, everyone!
It's King Aquaman!

06:14.374 --> 06:15.274
There, see?

06:15.375 --> 06:16.542
[giggles]

06:16.609 --> 06:17.844
[Ocean Master] Check this
out everybody!

06:17.910 --> 06:20.179
Duh, I'm King Aquaman!

06:20.246 --> 06:22.281
I was born on land.

06:22.382 --> 06:23.750
There's no wa-wa,

06:23.850 --> 06:27.553
so it hurts
to fall down. Whoops.

06:27.620 --> 06:30.089
Owie, I broke all my bones.

06:30.189 --> 06:32.425
I need my bones to stand!

06:32.525 --> 06:34.193
[growls]

06:34.260 --> 06:39.365
Guess I'll sit in this chair
and touch it with my big butt.

06:39.432 --> 06:40.767
[booing]

06:40.867 --> 06:42.635
- Hey!
-[Ocean Master] Uh-oh.

06:42.735 --> 06:43.736
[Atlantean] Hey!

06:43.803 --> 06:45.104
Don't worry, Atlanteans.

06:45.204 --> 06:48.207
Looks like a job
for King Aquaman the Good!

06:50.576 --> 06:51.978
I don't have a big butt.

06:52.078 --> 06:54.914
Yes he does, but it's nice!

06:57.049 --> 06:57.984
-[slurping on straw]
-[gasping]

06:58.084 --> 06:59.085
[Ocean Master laughs]

07:05.625 --> 07:07.660
Hey, look, it's Ocean Master!

07:07.760 --> 07:08.961
[cheering]

07:09.061 --> 07:10.430
[Aquaman] Hey, watch
where you're going!

07:10.496 --> 07:11.964
[Ocean Master] You can't
tell me what to do.

07:14.267 --> 07:16.002
[all] Ocean Master!

07:16.102 --> 07:18.004
- Aw, jeez.
- We got you guys!

07:18.104 --> 07:19.739
Ocean Master!

07:24.110 --> 07:26.913
Ocean Master! Ocean Master!
Ocean Master!

07:26.979 --> 07:28.648
Stop cheering for Ocean Master!

07:28.748 --> 07:31.284
We're the ones that saved you.
Stop it!

07:31.350 --> 07:34.520
Yeah! Ocean Master,
Ocean Master, Ocean Master!

07:34.620 --> 07:36.489
[Aquaman] Give me back
my trident, you little brat!

07:38.958 --> 07:40.026
- Gotcha!
- Uh-uh.

07:41.928 --> 07:43.529
[laughs]

07:43.629 --> 07:44.797
[Mera] I don't think so!

07:46.199 --> 07:48.034
[Aquaman] Ha-a! Sorry.

07:49.469 --> 07:50.503
Faster, peasant!

07:50.603 --> 07:52.538
Oh, yes, sir,
Mr. Ocean Master!

07:52.638 --> 07:54.006
Golly, so cool!

07:59.712 --> 08:00.546
Hey, cut it out.

08:00.646 --> 08:02.114
Aw, nuts! Look out!

08:02.648 --> 08:03.483
[laughs]

08:05.284 --> 08:08.221
Ocean Master! Whoo-hoo!

08:08.321 --> 08:09.188
That's it!

08:12.325 --> 08:13.693
[laughs] Uh-oh.

08:15.495 --> 08:17.663
Oh, no. Clams!

08:17.730 --> 08:19.866
Ow, ow, ow, ow! Stop it!
Tiny bites! Tiny bites!

08:19.966 --> 08:23.236
Outta the way!
Get off of me, clams!

08:23.336 --> 08:24.904
Hey, it's Ocean Master!

08:25.004 --> 08:27.039
He stepped on my foot!
I can't believe it!

08:27.139 --> 08:29.308
-[all cheering]
-[Aquaman] Stop liking
Ocean Master!

08:31.177 --> 08:33.746
Wow, it's Ocean Master!

08:33.846 --> 08:35.047
- What?
- Can I get a-- Oh!

08:35.147 --> 08:36.582
Autograph? Ahhh!

08:36.682 --> 08:38.885
Did you guys see Ocean Master?

08:38.985 --> 08:40.520
[screams]

08:40.586 --> 08:42.421
- Whoa there!
-[Aquaman] Sorry about that!

08:43.189 --> 08:44.190
Hyah!

08:44.257 --> 08:46.225
What an inconsiderate man.

08:46.325 --> 08:48.728
-[Ocean Master] Intentionally
punching you.
-[Atlantean] Thank you!

08:48.828 --> 08:51.397
[Mera] This way! He's headed
for the Seafood District!

08:54.667 --> 08:56.836
Your meal, sir. Enjoy! Whoa!

08:56.903 --> 08:58.738
[Ocean Master] Out of the way!

08:58.838 --> 09:01.941
Wow, Ocean Master came
to my restaurant.

09:02.041 --> 09:04.210
Oh, that's great for business.

09:04.277 --> 09:05.511
- Where'd he go?
- That way!

09:05.578 --> 09:08.414
Oh, it's the guy
who can talk to fish.

09:08.514 --> 09:10.750
He's terrible for business.

09:10.850 --> 09:13.019
Hey, just because
I can talk to sea creatures

09:13.085 --> 09:14.287
doesn't mean I don't eat them.

09:14.387 --> 09:15.855
[all grumbling]

09:15.922 --> 09:18.691
- Oh! Get out!
- Ow! Okay, Fine!

09:18.758 --> 09:20.927
[woman] You ruined it, Aquaman!

09:22.795 --> 09:24.096
Where'd he go?

09:24.196 --> 09:25.097
[gasps]

09:26.299 --> 09:29.035
Thanks for the ride. Grab on.

09:29.101 --> 09:31.270
Why do they call it
the Seafood District anyways?

09:31.370 --> 09:33.039
It's not like
there's a Land Food District.

09:33.105 --> 09:34.473
- Sure there is!
- Huh?

09:35.875 --> 09:37.310
[both groaning]

09:37.410 --> 09:39.078
Oh, the Land Food District!

09:39.145 --> 09:41.747
[laughs] They're dead!

09:41.814 --> 09:43.783
- No, we're not.
-[Ocean Master] Oh, rats!

09:45.318 --> 09:47.653
[laughs] Try and catch me!

09:47.753 --> 09:49.088
[growls] Ocean Master!

09:49.155 --> 09:51.157
[humming]

09:51.257 --> 09:53.225
Face it, Aquaman! You stink!

09:55.595 --> 09:56.462
Oh, no!

09:58.965 --> 10:02.902
C'mon! Ocean Master
is headed for the Global Vents!

10:02.969 --> 10:05.771
Right! Uh, totally.
The Global... what?

10:05.838 --> 10:07.773
Did you learn anything
at land school?

10:07.840 --> 10:10.176
Oh, or were they too busy
teaching you fairy tales,

10:10.276 --> 10:11.677
like "outer space"?

10:11.777 --> 10:13.679
Uh, outer space is real!

10:13.779 --> 10:17.283
Right. There's less water,
but more floating. Got it.

10:17.350 --> 10:19.485
- What? No!
-[gasps] There he is!

10:19.585 --> 10:21.187
[Ocean Master vocalizing]

10:21.287 --> 10:23.189
- Oh my gosh, I'm so excited.
- Shh!

10:23.289 --> 10:25.024
All clear!

10:25.124 --> 10:26.425
[Ocean Master] Outta the way!

10:26.492 --> 10:27.593
[Atlantean] Ahhh!

10:27.660 --> 10:29.428
[Ocean Master] Make way,
you dumb babies!

10:29.495 --> 10:30.630
Huh?

10:30.696 --> 10:32.131
Hey, it's Ocean Master!

10:32.198 --> 10:34.100
- Aw, so cool! Ahhh!
- Outta the way!

10:34.166 --> 10:35.134
[laughing]

10:38.804 --> 10:40.006
[commuter] Yo, Aquaman!

10:40.106 --> 10:41.841
Ocean Master's
got your trident.

10:41.941 --> 10:45.678
Oh, man, I would not want
to be in your position.

10:45.778 --> 10:48.014
[laughs] This is
so embarrassing for you.

10:48.114 --> 10:50.049
Argh! Argh! Argh!

10:51.183 --> 10:53.819
Oh, so embarrassing.

10:56.122 --> 10:56.956
[groans]

11:00.993 --> 11:02.228
Give us the trident!

11:02.328 --> 11:05.031
Why don't you come
and get it? [laughs]

11:06.365 --> 11:07.299
Fine by me.

11:10.903 --> 11:13.506
[Mera] Look at that!
The vents are real!

11:13.572 --> 11:15.975
What else did they teach you
at land school?

11:16.042 --> 11:18.911
That beneath the rock
is burning hot magma.

11:19.011 --> 11:20.579
Oh. Well, that part's true.

11:21.380 --> 11:23.649
[screaming]

11:23.716 --> 11:27.553
- Ah. I hate that part.
- Whoa! Where are we?

11:27.653 --> 11:28.854
Uh, the Ice Level.

11:28.921 --> 11:30.423
Gotta cool down
after the Lava Level.

11:30.523 --> 11:32.391
What? There's no ice
beneath the magma.

11:32.491 --> 11:34.393
Oh, here comes
the Clover Level!

11:36.262 --> 11:38.064
Huh?

11:38.164 --> 11:42.234
Ah! So pretty! Oh, man,
I just love this place.

11:42.334 --> 11:44.170
This can't be real.

11:44.236 --> 11:47.540
I feel like I'm losing my mind.

11:47.606 --> 11:48.941
Oh.

11:49.041 --> 11:51.777
Then you're really not gonna
like the Nightmare Level.

11:51.877 --> 11:54.046
- It's full of nightmares.
- What?

11:56.348 --> 11:57.950
Huh. I don't see
any nightmares.

11:58.050 --> 11:59.385
-[hisses]
-[screams]

11:59.452 --> 12:00.686
It's best not to look.

12:00.753 --> 12:02.288
[Aquaman] How can you not look?

12:02.388 --> 12:04.457
[Mera] Oh, great,
it's an eye guy.

12:04.557 --> 12:06.058
Mera...

12:06.125 --> 12:07.960
-[Mera] Don't look in the eye.
-[Aquaman] I can't help it.

12:08.060 --> 12:09.195
[screams]

12:09.261 --> 12:11.464
Calm down! We almost have him.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.866
I told you not to look
in the eye!

12:13.933 --> 12:15.267
[gasps]

12:17.470 --> 12:18.404
- Hmm.
- Ahhh!

12:21.574 --> 12:22.575
[Ocean Master] Ahhh!

12:24.443 --> 12:26.579
You haven't... Okay, uncle!

12:26.645 --> 12:29.615
[laughs] King Aquaman
is victorious!

12:29.715 --> 12:31.650
See, everyone, I'm a good king.

12:34.420 --> 12:35.721
[groans]

12:35.788 --> 12:36.922
Just give me the trident.

12:36.989 --> 12:40.226
No! I let you capture me
on purpose.

12:40.292 --> 12:41.427
You did not.

12:41.494 --> 12:43.662
Yeah-huh! Every nemesis
has a plan

12:43.763 --> 12:45.264
where they get captured
on purpose,

12:45.331 --> 12:46.298
and this one's mine!

12:46.398 --> 12:47.800
No, it isn't.

12:47.900 --> 12:50.069
And it's a dumb plan anyway.
What if you got away?

12:50.136 --> 12:51.270
I didn't want to!

12:51.337 --> 12:53.272
You tried really hard
to get away.

12:53.339 --> 12:54.473
You almost got away.

12:54.573 --> 12:55.841
- No, I didn't.
- No, he didn't.

12:55.941 --> 12:57.143
Yes, he did.

12:57.243 --> 12:59.678
I won and you lost.
Now let go of my trident

12:59.779 --> 13:01.347
- Never!
- Fine.

13:01.447 --> 13:03.783
[grunts]

13:03.849 --> 13:05.017
Face it, Ocean Master.

13:05.117 --> 13:06.819
Even though you tried
really hard,

13:06.919 --> 13:09.288
you can't distract me
from the facts.

13:09.355 --> 13:10.289
[fish wheezing]

13:16.462 --> 13:18.030
Okay, That's kind
of distracting.

13:18.130 --> 13:19.431
What is that?

13:19.498 --> 13:20.466
Whoa...

13:21.300 --> 13:23.302
I'm gonna touch this one.

13:23.369 --> 13:24.804
Maybe you shouldn't.

13:24.870 --> 13:25.971
Eh, I'm sure it's fine.

13:29.041 --> 13:30.543
[Aquaman and Ocean Master
screaming]

13:30.643 --> 13:33.512
Did you just get caught
on a fish hook? Really?

13:33.612 --> 13:34.847
No, I don't know

13:34.947 --> 13:36.615
All your conversations
with fish

13:36.682 --> 13:37.850
and this never came up?

13:37.950 --> 13:39.852
What is happening?

13:41.987 --> 13:42.822
What?

13:44.390 --> 13:45.658
Big fish.

13:47.293 --> 13:49.128
Ugh, is he part
of your plan too?

13:49.195 --> 13:50.729
Uh... Yeah, that's right!

13:50.830 --> 13:52.798
I've got an ally! Ha-ha!

13:52.865 --> 13:55.568
It's not my fault
you don't have any friends!

13:55.668 --> 13:56.902
I've got one.

13:58.137 --> 13:58.971
Huh?

14:08.747 --> 14:09.582
Crud!

[grunts]

14:23.362 --> 14:24.830
[coughs]

14:24.897 --> 14:30.436
Ah! A noble ally has come
to the rescue of Ocean Master.

14:30.536 --> 14:31.370
[growls]

14:33.405 --> 14:37.443
[laughs nervous] Of course,
you will be handsomely rewarded

14:37.543 --> 14:38.544
for your service.

14:40.713 --> 14:42.548
Uh, uh, well...

14:42.615 --> 14:43.916
uh, rewarded anyhow--

14:44.016 --> 14:45.417
Whoa! Hey, hey what gives?

14:45.517 --> 14:47.620
We're supposed to be allies.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.355
Let me go. Come on, man.

14:49.421 --> 14:50.856
Small fish.

14:53.359 --> 14:54.293
[Aquaman] Almost got it!

14:54.393 --> 14:56.028
You're making it worse

14:56.095 --> 14:57.630
Wait! Just quit moving around!

14:57.730 --> 14:59.632
Okay. I think I made it worse.

14:59.732 --> 15:02.067
[growls] Big fish.

15:02.134 --> 15:06.205
Help! Save me Aquaman! Help me!
Save me! Help! Help!

15:06.272 --> 15:08.540
Save you? I thought this guy
was your ally.

15:08.607 --> 15:09.541
I was lying!

15:09.608 --> 15:15.147
Save me! You have to save me!

15:15.247 --> 15:17.650
[groans] Ocean Master.

15:20.586 --> 15:21.820
Whoa!

15:21.921 --> 15:23.389
He's got us hooked!
Can you sink that thing?

15:23.455 --> 15:24.556
Hmm. I'll try!

15:27.993 --> 15:29.428
Whoa! You're doing it!

15:31.163 --> 15:32.765
It's working. Keep going!

15:32.831 --> 15:35.100
- Quiet, I need to concentrate!
- Oop! Right.

15:41.807 --> 15:43.676
- Ahhh! He's got a torpedo!
- What?

15:49.782 --> 15:52.785
Oh. Ha-ha!
It's just a regular grenade.

15:52.851 --> 15:53.686
Hmm?

16:04.029 --> 16:05.431
[groans]

16:05.497 --> 16:08.467
Huh? Ocean Master?

16:11.470 --> 16:14.373
Hey Ocean Master,
you out there anywhere?

16:14.473 --> 16:16.375
Uh, I think he's gone.

16:16.475 --> 16:20.179
[sighs] So be it.
Farewell, my brother.

16:20.279 --> 16:21.380
Still got your trident.

16:21.480 --> 16:23.315
Oh, that little...
Ugh, I hate this!

16:23.382 --> 16:24.883
We're supposed to be getting
revenge on him,

16:24.984 --> 16:26.151
not saving him.

16:26.218 --> 16:28.554
It's fine. It'll still be
the same mission.

16:28.654 --> 16:30.556
Get Ocean Master, punch him,

16:30.656 --> 16:32.791
and bring the trident back
to Atlantis.

16:33.993 --> 16:35.861
Yeah, but it's less fun now.

16:35.961 --> 16:37.162
True.

16:37.229 --> 16:38.731
But if you don't bring
Ocean Master back,

16:38.831 --> 16:40.399
everyone's definitely
gonna think

16:40.499 --> 16:42.067
you one hundred percent
killed him.

16:42.167 --> 16:46.338
And I won't even get to.
That's the worst part. [groans]

16:46.405 --> 16:47.506
Where do you think they went?

16:47.573 --> 16:48.841
I don't know.

16:48.907 --> 16:50.142
I have to ask for help
from the only people

16:50.209 --> 16:51.877
who don't think
I'm a total joke.

16:51.977 --> 16:53.879
People who are not people.

16:53.979 --> 16:56.348
- People who--

know anything

about that fisherman guy?

Hmm. Ah, here we go!

Pardon me. Do you know anything
about a fisherman around here?

- What's crazy?
- Nothing.

getting into this conversation.

Ooh! What about this guy?
Ask this guy.

asking me to talk to a cow?

18:14.593 --> 18:15.894
Let's go talk to some krill.

Have you seen a fisherman
around here?

Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

What are they saying?

Yes. Krill are very intelligent
and respect their king.

18:30.242 --> 18:33.078
No, I mean, should we be
worried about, "beasts?"

18:33.145 --> 18:34.480
Nah. Krill are cowards.

18:34.580 --> 18:35.414
It's probably nothing.

19:51.523 --> 19:54.359
The krill were right,
krill are always right!

19:54.426 --> 19:55.727
Out of the water!

20:01.934 --> 20:03.835
[screams]

20:03.902 --> 20:05.404
What are these things

20:09.374 --> 20:13.011
Ugh. I blame
that creepy fisherman dude.

20:13.078 --> 20:16.014
Well, this is his island.
Let's ask him.

20:16.081 --> 20:17.683
[groans]

20:17.749 --> 20:20.085
-[Mera] Hey watch it!
- Oops, sorry.

20:20.185 --> 20:21.520
Stupid branches!

20:21.587 --> 20:23.355
This would be a lot easier
if I had my trident.

20:23.422 --> 20:26.124
If you had your trident,
we wouldn't be here.

20:26.225 --> 20:28.427
- I know that!
- Don't yell at me.

20:28.527 --> 20:31.296
Okay, fine. Just give me
a second to stop yelling

20:31.396 --> 20:33.632
because it's hard to stop
once I start.

20:33.732 --> 20:34.967
- Fine!

20:35.067 --> 20:36.735
[both growling]

20:36.802 --> 20:38.370
[Aquaman sighs]

20:38.437 --> 20:41.807
I just... Sometimes I don't
know if I'm cut out to be king.

20:41.907 --> 20:43.575
Everything I do seems wrong.

20:43.642 --> 20:46.144
Ocean Master took my trident
and everyone laughed...

20:46.245 --> 20:49.114
My basic understanding of what
the earth is made of

20:49.214 --> 20:50.315
is totally wrong.

20:50.415 --> 20:51.783
A creepy guy
with a squid for a hat

20:51.883 --> 20:53.752
tried to blow me up
with a fishing lure.

20:53.819 --> 20:55.754
There's dang monsters
in the water.

20:55.821 --> 20:57.923
I had to watch a crab
eat snails.

20:57.990 --> 20:59.925
And now I have to save
my dumb half brother

20:59.992 --> 21:01.660
and get my trident back,

21:01.760 --> 21:04.229
so that maybe
Atlantis won't realize
I'm a total fraud!

21:05.931 --> 21:07.899
Did you see the way
they made fun of me?

21:07.966 --> 21:09.835
Hey, I make fun of you.

21:09.935 --> 21:11.470
That's different. I know you.

21:12.638 --> 21:13.939
[rustling]

21:14.006 --> 21:15.474
What the heck was that?
Did you hear that sound?

21:15.574 --> 21:17.309
Something is stalking us!

21:17.409 --> 21:19.745
Huh? Come out
and show yourself!

21:23.448 --> 21:25.250
Uh. Maybe don't show yourself.

21:25.317 --> 21:26.518
You probably look all weird.

21:27.419 --> 21:28.920
[shrieks]

21:28.987 --> 21:30.455
[screams]

21:30.522 --> 21:32.024
What is this thing?

21:32.124 --> 21:33.358
[Wendy] Tim! Knock that off!

21:33.458 --> 21:34.760
-[Tim sighs]
- Tim?

21:38.297 --> 21:40.699
Sorry about my boy.

21:40.799 --> 21:42.834
We don't get many guests
out here.

21:42.934 --> 21:44.870
I've got a bad feeling
about this.

21:44.970 --> 21:46.938
- Please be careful.
- Don't worry.

21:47.005 --> 21:48.440
I will.

21:48.507 --> 21:51.109
[Aquaman chewing]

21:51.176 --> 21:52.344
Oh, that's good.

21:57.482 --> 22:00.152
So good. This is good.

22:02.387 --> 22:03.622
So good.

22:04.489 --> 22:05.490
Oh, boy!

22:06.491 --> 22:09.061
Wendy, you are a master chef!

22:10.662 --> 22:12.531
I thought you said
you'd be careful.

22:12.631 --> 22:14.666
I know,
but it's grilled salmon!

22:14.733 --> 22:16.468
I love grilled salmon!

22:16.535 --> 22:17.736
I know.

22:17.836 --> 22:19.338
[laughs] She knows
I love grilled salmon.

22:19.404 --> 22:20.806
-[scoffs]
- I can't grill in Atlantis.

22:20.872 --> 22:22.507
- Huh?
- And it's not just the water

22:22.574 --> 22:23.909
The whole idea
of cooking your food

22:24.009 --> 22:25.410
- really freaks everyone out.
-[scoffs]

22:25.510 --> 22:27.913
Even the sharks think
it's like, psychopathic.

22:28.013 --> 22:29.548
I don't even
bring it up any-- Ow!

22:31.983 --> 22:33.485
Look, we're trying
to find a fisherman

22:33.552 --> 22:35.654
so we can talk to him
about some monsters.

22:35.721 --> 22:37.189
He wears a squid for a hat.

22:37.255 --> 22:39.257
Really ugly, creepy guy.

22:39.358 --> 22:41.093
Do you know anyone like that?

22:41.193 --> 22:44.429
The only fisherman I know
who lives around here
is my husband.

22:44.529 --> 22:46.932
Oh, well, that's, uh,

22:47.032 --> 22:48.266
obviously not him.

22:48.367 --> 22:50.402
Because your family
is not creepy and weird.

22:50.502 --> 22:51.503
Oh...

22:53.205 --> 22:54.373
[gurgling]

22:54.906 --> 22:55.907
Hello.

22:56.007 --> 22:57.876
[gurgles and chuckles]

22:57.943 --> 22:59.678
But just out of curiosity,

22:59.745 --> 23:01.546
where would we find
your fisherman husband?

23:01.613 --> 23:04.282
- What's his name?
- His name is Fisherman.

23:05.250 --> 23:07.419
Very normal.

23:07.519 --> 23:09.388
I wish I could tell you
where he is.

23:09.454 --> 23:11.022
I haven't seen him in weeks.

23:11.089 --> 23:13.692
He saw some strange lights
out on the water.

23:13.759 --> 23:15.460
Took his boat out
to investigate,

23:15.560 --> 23:16.695
and never returned.

23:16.762 --> 23:18.930
The sea started getting weird.

23:19.030 --> 23:21.700
Started filling up with fish
that aren't right.

23:21.767 --> 23:23.235
Sounds like
they're definitely connected,

23:23.301 --> 23:26.138
But he never wore a squid hat,
not my Fisherman.

23:26.238 --> 23:28.373
Sure he wore a crab hat
for a whole year.

23:28.440 --> 23:29.975
But that was a joke.

23:31.276 --> 23:33.111
And what a funny joke it is.

23:33.211 --> 23:34.379
I get it.

23:34.446 --> 23:35.814
You'll find my husband,
won't you?

23:35.914 --> 23:37.983
Find out what's causing
those lights?

23:38.083 --> 23:40.152
We're too far south
for the Northern lights,

23:40.252 --> 23:44.289
too far east for
the West Fargo, bowling alley
laser light Friday nights.

23:44.389 --> 23:46.458
And those strange fish.

23:46.558 --> 23:48.059
Something's wrong.

23:48.126 --> 23:49.161
I can feel it.

23:49.261 --> 23:50.095
Please.

23:50.162 --> 23:51.830
Timmy needs his dad.

23:52.931 --> 23:54.266
I understand.

23:54.332 --> 23:56.768
My mother was stolen from me
when I was a baby.

23:56.835 --> 23:58.770
I spent my life
looking out to sea,

23:58.837 --> 24:00.772
wondering if I'd ever
see her again.

24:02.274 --> 24:04.509
I wouldn't wish that
on my worst enemy.

24:04.609 --> 24:07.412
I'll find your dad,
and my worst enemy.

24:07.479 --> 24:08.447
He's with your dad.

24:08.513 --> 24:11.616
Huh? [warbles]

24:11.683 --> 24:14.352
[gasps] Again with the snails.

24:14.453 --> 24:15.854
Ah, we'll swim out
and find him.

24:15.954 --> 24:18.089
No, the waters are dangerous.

24:18.156 --> 24:20.091
Take boat.

24:20.158 --> 24:21.693
Eh, we're used to danger.

24:21.793 --> 24:24.162
You've never seen
danger like this.

24:24.262 --> 24:25.630
Take a boat

24:25.697 --> 24:26.998
[thunder rumbles]

24:35.106 --> 24:38.210
Yeah, it's probably good
we're not in the water.

24:38.310 --> 24:40.512
It's nice of Wendy
to lend us this boat.

24:40.612 --> 24:41.613
Hey, look at me.

24:41.680 --> 24:42.714
Ahoy, there.

24:42.814 --> 24:47.619
I'm Captain Mera
of the SS... Boat?

24:47.686 --> 24:50.188
It gets the point across.
I'll give her that.

24:50.288 --> 24:53.391
Hey, it was nice of you
to share that stuff
about your mother.

24:53.492 --> 24:55.293
I know you don't like
to talk about it.

24:55.360 --> 24:58.997
[sighs] I keep
thinking about my dad,
about his lighthouse.

24:59.064 --> 25:02.300
How many boats like this one
followed my father's light
to safety?

25:02.367 --> 25:04.002
How many fishermen
did he bring home?

25:04.803 --> 25:05.971
Other kids' fathers.

25:06.037 --> 25:08.507
Other kids' mothers.

25:08.573 --> 25:11.042
I don't think
these lights go home.

25:11.142 --> 25:12.577
No, of course they don't.

25:12.677 --> 25:13.845
Everything's upside down.

25:13.912 --> 25:15.413
I don't understand any of it.

25:15.514 --> 25:17.349
A king is supposed to be wise.

25:17.415 --> 25:19.918
I look around
and nothing makes sense.

25:20.018 --> 25:21.887
It only feels that way.

25:25.357 --> 25:28.360
Okay, fine, I have absolutely
no idea what any
of these things are,

25:28.426 --> 25:32.063
but sometimes you just
got to beat some sense
into the world.

25:32.163 --> 25:34.065
-[gasps] Whoa.
-[snarls]

25:36.067 --> 25:37.102
Get out of here.

25:38.103 --> 25:39.237
[screeches]

25:42.440 --> 25:44.576
I really wish
I had my trident now.

25:44.676 --> 25:47.279
Good thing I still have
my favorite weapon.

25:49.548 --> 25:51.216
Batter up. Here comes...

25:51.283 --> 25:53.218
Gross. It's got
a bunch of guys in it.

25:53.285 --> 25:55.887
Well, I think we're
about to find out where
that light's coming from.

25:55.954 --> 25:56.888
Look.

26:00.559 --> 26:03.862
Creatures are coming
from that big gross island.

26:06.598 --> 26:07.699
[whimpers]

26:11.069 --> 26:12.237
Stop that.

26:12.304 --> 26:13.471
I don't think
we can hold them off.

26:17.475 --> 26:19.945
I can't die on this boat
like a true surface dweller.

26:20.045 --> 26:23.381
Everyone in Atlantis
is gonna think I'm a clown.

26:23.448 --> 26:26.318
Who cares what they think?
You'll be dead.

26:26.418 --> 26:27.752
Most clowns are dead.

26:27.819 --> 26:29.921
You really want those
to be your last words?

26:29.988 --> 26:30.989
Okay, fine.

26:31.089 --> 26:32.057
I love you.

26:33.592 --> 26:34.492
Really.

26:34.593 --> 26:35.827
Aw, I really--

26:37.228 --> 26:38.163
I love you too.

26:41.666 --> 26:43.168
Huh?

26:43.268 --> 26:44.803
Mera! Mera!

26:44.903 --> 26:47.305
We've got to get out of here.
These things are everywhere.

26:47.405 --> 26:49.641
- Ahhh!
-[both grunting]

26:51.743 --> 26:52.577
[gasping]

26:53.111 --> 26:54.279
Ew!

26:56.615 --> 26:58.183
Oh, great.

26:58.283 --> 27:00.185
The only thing more
embarrassing than
needing a boat

27:00.285 --> 27:02.287
is being stuck
without one here.

27:05.957 --> 27:07.859
What is this place?

27:15.433 --> 27:17.836
Hey, Fisherman,
we're friends now.

27:17.936 --> 27:20.672
Look, Wendy even gave us Boat.

27:20.772 --> 27:23.942
-[shrieking]
- Uh, yeah, sorry about that,

27:24.009 --> 27:26.945
but we'll find some other way
to get you off this island.

27:27.012 --> 27:28.947
[chuckles]

27:29.014 --> 27:31.383
[laughing maniacally]

27:31.483 --> 27:33.151
Fisherman is gone.

27:33.218 --> 27:35.820
I am Primordeus,

27:35.887 --> 27:41.526
and I am this island

27:41.626 --> 27:43.495
- Okay, that's scary. [gasps]
- Huh?

27:43.561 --> 27:44.863
[both] Whoa!

27:49.868 --> 27:53.371
I think that squid is messing
with Fisherman's brain.

27:53.471 --> 27:59.077
Yes, the squid is an extension
of the mind of Primordeus,

27:59.177 --> 28:01.813
like these other creatures.

28:01.880 --> 28:07.318
Our minds merged inseparably
when Fisherman put the squid
on his head.

28:07.385 --> 28:09.587
You know, as a joke.

28:09.688 --> 28:12.157
Oh, that's good. [chuckles]

28:12.223 --> 28:13.558
- It's funny.
- I'm going to be honest.

28:13.658 --> 28:14.826
I don't get it at all.

28:14.893 --> 28:16.528
I am a highly evolved
super being

28:16.594 --> 28:19.931
who processes existence
1,000 times faster
than you.

28:20.031 --> 28:23.401
I promise you,
the joke is very funny.

28:23.501 --> 28:24.602
Just give us Fisherman.

28:24.703 --> 28:25.937
His family needs him.

28:26.037 --> 28:28.506
Oh, yes, his family.

28:28.573 --> 28:29.941
When I met the Fisherman

28:30.041 --> 28:33.678
he wanted nothing more
than to catch the big fish

28:33.745 --> 28:35.780
and feed his family.

28:35.880 --> 28:36.948
Pathetic.

28:37.048 --> 28:39.884
Now he wants
what Primordeus wants.

28:39.951 --> 28:41.686
To spread.

28:42.721 --> 28:43.888
To conquer.

28:46.424 --> 28:49.527
To rule the entire ocean!

28:55.066 --> 28:56.968
- No.
- What?

28:57.068 --> 29:01.206
No. The ocean has one king,
and he's tired of people
coming for his throne.

29:01.272 --> 29:02.974
I am King Aquaman.

29:03.074 --> 29:04.309
You will kneel before me

29:04.409 --> 29:06.244
and you will give me
that freaking trident.

29:09.380 --> 29:12.584
You bore me, King Aquaman.

29:14.919 --> 29:19.591
At least your friend's
preparing to do something
very interesting

29:33.738 --> 29:35.340
[groans]

29:37.909 --> 29:38.810
Ow.

29:38.910 --> 29:40.078
Aquaman!

29:45.784 --> 29:47.252
[chuckles]

29:48.586 --> 29:49.487
Whoa.

30:01.633 --> 30:02.600
Whoa. Huh?

30:04.769 --> 30:06.971
Ugh, Fisherman!

30:09.274 --> 30:10.208
[screams]

30:12.177 --> 30:13.611
Sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

30:16.781 --> 30:17.615
Ow.

30:18.349 --> 30:19.617
Huh?

30:19.684 --> 30:21.019
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

30:21.119 --> 30:22.821
Oh, my gosh.
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

30:23.988 --> 30:25.223
Mera!

30:25.323 --> 30:27.225
Okay, no more water.

30:29.494 --> 30:32.030
Time to bust out the classics.

30:32.130 --> 30:33.731
Dodge this.

30:33.832 --> 30:34.699
[chuckles]

30:37.402 --> 30:38.903
All right, tough guy.

30:42.173 --> 30:43.074
Come here.

30:49.848 --> 30:52.083
Stop dodging

30:52.183 --> 30:53.751
Very well.

30:53.852 --> 30:55.253
Very well indeed.

30:58.056 --> 30:59.090
Ow!

31:01.492 --> 31:02.694
Ow!

31:02.760 --> 31:03.862
Ow!

31:03.928 --> 31:04.996
Ow!

31:05.063 --> 31:05.897
Ow!

31:09.000 --> 31:11.069
Ow, my fingies.

31:11.169 --> 31:12.337
What was that?

31:14.239 --> 31:15.607
Oh, nuts.

31:17.542 --> 31:18.743
[chuckles]

31:18.843 --> 31:21.379
I told you I experience time

31:21.446 --> 31:26.050
faster than you lowly beings
can possibly comprehend.

31:29.721 --> 31:32.957
- Huh?
- To me you move
more like statues.

31:33.057 --> 31:35.426
No more bothersome
than an itch.

31:36.895 --> 31:39.397
Oh, yeah. What about
an itch you can't reach?

31:40.431 --> 31:41.699
I can reach any itch.

31:43.902 --> 31:45.970
You call yourself a king?

31:46.070 --> 31:50.041
Well, what is a king
compared to a living god?

31:50.108 --> 31:52.310
[laughs maniacally]

31:52.410 --> 31:55.580
You know what?
I don't need this
in my life right now.

31:55.647 --> 31:57.115
I'm done. I'm out of here.

31:57.215 --> 31:59.417
You think you can
escape from me?

31:59.484 --> 32:00.652
No, I don't.

32:00.752 --> 32:02.487
You know what I think's
gonna happen?

32:02.587 --> 32:04.722
I think you're
going to skewer me
with my own trident.

32:04.789 --> 32:07.058
And when you do, I think
my pants are going to rip

32:07.125 --> 32:08.993
and a bird is going to poop
on my head.

32:09.093 --> 32:11.829
And then, you and your monsters
are gonna take over the ocean,

32:11.930 --> 32:13.831
and massacre
everyone in Atlantis.

32:13.932 --> 32:16.134
And everyone in Atlantis
right before they die,

32:16.234 --> 32:18.069
you know what
they're going to say?

32:18.136 --> 32:20.672
They're going to say,
"Well, at least he's not
King Aquaman.

32:20.772 --> 32:22.340
That guy was a real loser."

32:22.440 --> 32:24.475
And they're all going to have
a big laugh as you eat them,

32:24.575 --> 32:27.178
or zombify them,
or whatever your deal is.

32:27.278 --> 32:29.414
- Hmm?
- I've had my throne stolen,

32:29.480 --> 32:30.815
my trident stolen.

32:30.915 --> 32:33.351
I've had an entire year stolen.

32:33.451 --> 32:34.752
A whole year.

32:34.819 --> 32:36.287
I don't want to know what
my freak smells like.

32:36.354 --> 32:38.156
I've been blown up,
chomped on.

32:38.256 --> 32:39.958
People laughed at my butt.

32:40.024 --> 32:42.527
I had to watch people
eat snails twice.

32:42.627 --> 32:44.629
And now, Aquaman, King Dingus,

32:44.696 --> 32:47.031
has to find
a living God island?

32:50.101 --> 32:51.102
[grunts]

32:54.973 --> 32:56.374
Hey, do that again.

32:56.474 --> 32:58.176
What? This.

32:58.276 --> 32:59.210
[winces]

32:59.310 --> 33:00.712
That's it. Okay.

33:00.812 --> 33:03.381
New plan. It's punching time.

33:03.481 --> 33:05.216
Sounds a lot like
your old plan.

33:05.316 --> 33:07.552
Ha! Take your best shot.

33:07.652 --> 33:10.355
My mind is faster
than you can imagine.

33:12.690 --> 33:14.058
But your body isn't.

33:14.158 --> 33:16.160
Fisherman is just
the voice of Primordeus.

33:16.227 --> 33:17.895
The entire island is his body.

33:17.996 --> 33:20.365
It's impossible to miss
and a voice split up,

33:20.465 --> 33:21.733
he can't stop us both.

33:25.837 --> 33:27.839
- Silence.
- Mera.

33:29.907 --> 33:31.242
This.

33:31.342 --> 33:32.210
And, this.

33:32.310 --> 33:33.244
Argh!

33:33.344 --> 33:34.545
Stop that.

33:49.994 --> 33:51.329
Stop. Please.

33:51.396 --> 33:52.263
No.

33:54.098 --> 33:55.233
[groans]

34:09.247 --> 34:12.950
Yeah. Oh, man, I always wanted
to swing on a vine,

34:13.051 --> 34:15.386
or whatever this is.

34:19.791 --> 34:21.392
Keep going.

34:21.459 --> 34:23.594
Center of the island.
That's where the light's
coming from.

34:23.694 --> 34:25.963
No, stop. Don't go there.

34:26.063 --> 34:27.231
Right behind you, Aquaman.

34:27.298 --> 34:28.366
Please. No.

34:29.233 --> 34:30.401
Meh, it'll grow back.

34:33.538 --> 34:34.405
Whoa.

34:38.443 --> 34:40.711
Oh, that looks good.
Let's check that out

34:42.046 --> 34:42.914
Wait.

34:45.750 --> 34:47.318
- Ready?
- All right.

34:48.319 --> 34:51.756
No! Stop!

34:51.823 --> 34:53.224
You know, I'm actually
starting to think

34:53.291 --> 34:55.259
this whole experience
is quite good for--

34:58.663 --> 35:00.598
Huh? Oh.

35:00.665 --> 35:04.235
Wow, it's beautiful.

35:04.302 --> 35:08.106
Well, not beautiful,
but it's something.

35:08.172 --> 35:10.241
[grumbling]

35:10.308 --> 35:12.443
- Hey, Aquaman, check it out.
- Huh?

35:13.111 --> 35:13.978
Look?

35:18.783 --> 35:21.853
Everything outside the bubble
is frozen in time.

35:21.953 --> 35:24.288
This is where
Primordeus's mind is.

35:24.355 --> 35:28.292
Now that we're in here,
we're perceiving time
as fast as he is.

35:28.359 --> 35:29.193
Awesome.

35:29.293 --> 35:30.928
-[chuckles]
- Huh?

35:30.995 --> 35:34.031
All right,
Primordeus, or Fisherman,
or whatever your name is.

35:34.132 --> 35:38.503
Now the playing field is even.
Time to battle as equals.

35:43.141 --> 35:44.542
Whoops.

35:44.642 --> 35:45.676
Argh!

35:50.314 --> 35:53.217
This is so much easier
than I thought it would be.

35:53.317 --> 35:57.822
No. Just gotta
pick the leg. Oh...

35:57.889 --> 35:59.657
I think he's had it, man.

35:59.724 --> 36:01.826
Yeah, all right.

36:01.893 --> 36:06.664
Aquaman, the good,
has achieved his goal
and reclaimed his trident.

36:08.499 --> 36:10.568
Was this thing even worth it?

36:10.668 --> 36:12.069
Yeah, I think so.

36:12.170 --> 36:14.338
Anyway, let's go check out
that giant head

36:14.405 --> 36:16.507
with all the fingers
and teeth and eyeballs,

36:16.574 --> 36:17.575
Huh?

36:19.343 --> 36:21.078
Oh, yeah. Big head thing.

36:22.079 --> 36:23.514
The light's coming from inside.

36:25.550 --> 36:28.319
- Well, what do you know?
- Huh?

36:28.386 --> 36:31.155
What the heck,
is that another crystal...

36:33.057 --> 36:34.158
like Mortikov's?

36:34.225 --> 36:36.494
Yeah, different color, though.

36:36.561 --> 36:37.428
I'll check for batteries.

36:37.528 --> 36:38.896
No, wait. Look.

36:38.996 --> 36:41.265
This one's powered
by that toxic waste.

36:41.365 --> 36:42.934
I don't think
we should touch it.

36:43.034 --> 36:44.435
Don't worry, I won't.

36:44.535 --> 36:47.338
Luckily for us, toxic waste
is the same as water.

36:47.405 --> 36:49.907
That's why you don't work
for my sanitation department.

36:50.007 --> 36:52.343
One. You don't have
a sanitation department.

36:52.410 --> 36:54.111
Maybe listen to Vulko
once in a while.

36:54.212 --> 36:56.047
And, two, stand back.

37:01.385 --> 37:02.954
You did it. it's powering down.

37:07.892 --> 37:09.527
Hey, let's get out of here.

37:09.594 --> 37:11.128
Huh? Oh, okay.

37:11.229 --> 37:13.097
Hey, wait up.

37:16.901 --> 37:17.802
Mera?

37:17.902 --> 37:18.769
Hey, up here.

37:22.573 --> 37:23.474
Whoa.

37:29.914 --> 37:32.617
The time bubble thing is gone,
it's all back to normal.

37:32.717 --> 37:35.586
- It's beautiful.
- You can see forever.

37:35.653 --> 37:37.421
It's like the view
from your lighthouse.

37:37.488 --> 37:40.591
I don't know.
I think it might be
better than my lighthouse

37:42.460 --> 37:43.327
[both] Huh?

37:46.397 --> 37:47.298
Oh?

37:48.332 --> 37:49.467
No, please.

37:49.567 --> 37:52.637
I just wanted to see.

37:52.737 --> 37:56.741
Primordeus has
never experienced
normal time before.

37:56.807 --> 37:58.509
Primordeus.

37:58.609 --> 38:02.513
I was birthed
by the glowing waste
and evolved over millennia

38:02.613 --> 38:05.182
inside the time distortion
of the crystal.

38:05.283 --> 38:07.018
But how long was it really?

38:07.118 --> 38:08.019
A week?

38:08.119 --> 38:09.320
A day.

38:09.420 --> 38:11.956
So, you were evolving
those monsters.

38:12.023 --> 38:15.293
And with time
returning to normal,
you can't do that anymore?

38:15.359 --> 38:18.596
- Great, we did it.
- What about the monsters
that are already out there?

38:18.663 --> 38:21.265
Eh, it's a big ocean.
There's room
for a few monsters.

38:21.332 --> 38:22.867
Are we older now?
How does this work?

38:22.967 --> 38:26.971
No, time stopped outside
the bubble this time.

38:27.038 --> 38:31.309
But now that you
mention it, I think I see
a couple gray hairs.

38:31.375 --> 38:34.478
Gray hair makes you look
tough and cool.

38:34.545 --> 38:35.713
But you're kidding, right?

38:35.813 --> 38:37.815
Just enjoy
the sunrise, Grandpa.

38:37.882 --> 38:39.517
Enjoy it?

38:39.617 --> 38:43.120
The entire world
is turning so quickly.
Right before your eyes.

38:43.187 --> 38:44.322
It's terrifying.

38:44.388 --> 38:47.625
The sun will scarcely set
before it rises,

38:47.692 --> 38:49.226
and again, and again.

38:49.327 --> 38:52.029
Your very lives
are rushing past.

38:52.129 --> 38:56.334
You barely have time
to think before, before...

38:57.335 --> 38:58.336
[farts]

39:00.404 --> 39:03.074
Doesn't it make you feel small?

39:03.174 --> 39:04.809
Yeah, it does.

39:04.875 --> 39:09.547
Perhaps it is well enough
to be small,
to be like Aquaman.

39:10.848 --> 39:12.049
Yeah, I guess it is.

39:12.149 --> 39:15.419
To be weak and slow,
and insignificant.

39:15.519 --> 39:18.589
- Okay, well,
I'm relatively strong--
- And, not smart.

39:18.689 --> 39:20.157
Yeah, I still don't
like this guy.

39:20.224 --> 39:21.892
Look, it's true.

39:21.992 --> 39:23.427
We don't have
all the time in the world.

39:23.527 --> 39:25.830
But that's why people
are important.

39:25.896 --> 39:27.765
Our time is precious.

39:27.865 --> 39:31.035
So when we spend it
with each other
we make each other significant.

39:31.102 --> 39:34.438
I... I think I understand.

39:34.538 --> 39:37.608
Hey, Fisherman, there you are.

39:37.708 --> 39:39.076
My family.

39:39.176 --> 39:42.179
My weak and slow little family.

39:42.246 --> 39:43.781
It has been eons.

39:43.881 --> 39:47.618
- Hello, uh--
- Wendy and Tim.

39:47.718 --> 39:48.619
Hello, Wendy.

39:49.253 --> 39:50.621
Hello, Tim.

39:50.721 --> 39:53.290
Yeah. I felt bad about
sending you here all alone.

39:53.391 --> 39:54.692
So, we came to dig your grave

39:54.759 --> 39:56.360
in case you died
a horrible death.

39:56.427 --> 39:57.428
Looks like you're fine.

39:57.528 --> 39:58.462
So that's good.

39:58.562 --> 40:00.297
Yep. We're all fine.

40:00.398 --> 40:01.966
I'm an island now.

40:02.066 --> 40:03.868
- Sorry.
- Nah, that's all right.

40:03.934 --> 40:04.902
We'll just live here.

40:04.969 --> 40:05.970
Give your father a hug.

40:06.070 --> 40:07.271
[warbles]

40:08.806 --> 40:09.974
[chuckles]

40:10.074 --> 40:11.208
Ouch.

40:11.275 --> 40:12.977
Well, I'm glad
that all worked out.

40:13.077 --> 40:14.812
Come on, Mera. Let's go home.

40:14.912 --> 40:16.080
I miss Atlantis.

40:16.147 --> 40:17.915
Even if they do
make fun of my butt.

40:17.982 --> 40:20.818
- Eh, they're just jealous
you grew up with staircases.
-[groans]

40:20.918 --> 40:22.820
Got them gravity glutes.

40:22.920 --> 40:23.988
Never say that.

40:24.088 --> 40:25.156
So long, Primordeus.

40:25.256 --> 40:26.791
Good luck, Fisherman.

40:26.891 --> 40:30.661
I'm glad we were
able to teach you
the importance of family.

40:30.761 --> 40:33.831
Speaking of family,
do you want your brother back?

40:33.931 --> 40:35.232
[both] Ocean Master!

40:35.299 --> 40:37.168
- What a man.
- We totally forgot.

40:37.268 --> 40:42.006
Uh, hey, Ocean Master,
you look good.

40:42.106 --> 40:44.341
[groaning]

40:44.442 --> 40:46.477
I'm gonna get you out of here.

40:47.111 --> 40:48.012
[exclaims]

40:50.948 --> 40:52.817
Ha-ha! Freedom!

40:53.818 --> 40:55.019
[coughs]

40:57.288 --> 40:58.456
Whoa!

40:58.522 --> 41:02.626
- You, uh...
- You're super old, huh.

41:02.693 --> 41:04.261
You know what? It's fine.

41:04.328 --> 41:06.430
I don't have to
understand everything.
It's fine.

41:06.497 --> 41:08.966
[groaning]

41:09.033 --> 41:10.468
Should I punch him?

41:10.534 --> 41:13.370
- I wouldn't
feel right about that.
- Aw!

41:13.471 --> 41:14.872
Give me that trident.

41:17.975 --> 41:19.477
You can't have my trident.

41:19.543 --> 41:22.880
Well, can I have a cane
or stick or something?

41:22.980 --> 41:25.449
I've been here for,
like, a hundred years.

41:25.516 --> 41:26.650
My back hurts.

41:28.819 --> 41:32.223
How about a fishy back ride?
Will be good for your joints.

41:32.323 --> 41:34.725
Come back and visit
any time, Aquaman.

41:34.825 --> 41:35.793
I will.

41:39.530 --> 41:41.332
- You won't.
- Definitely not.

41:41.398 --> 41:44.368
Come on, we got to get back
and show this thing to Vulko.

41:44.468 --> 41:47.071
He said he had eight books
about a weird blue crystal,

41:47.171 --> 41:50.174
so maybe one of them is about
a weird red crystal, too.

41:54.345 --> 41:55.646
[chomping]

41:55.713 --> 41:56.847
[laughs]

42:00.184 --> 42:02.753
Oh, that
grilled salmon, though.

42:02.853 --> 42:04.421
No, no, no, no, no, no.

42:04.522 --> 42:05.556
Just walk away

42:10.027 --> 42:11.562
[giggling]

42:26.377 --> 42:28.279
Hey, it's a little late,
don't you think?

42:29.713 --> 42:31.749
For work, I mean.
You should go home.

42:31.849 --> 42:33.517
Thanks, Your Majesty.

42:33.584 --> 42:34.952
You did a great job today.

42:36.220 --> 42:37.588
You did too.

42:37.688 --> 42:39.223
Aw, thanks.

42:39.290 --> 42:41.358
You know, I was starting
to think you guys
didn't like me.

42:42.393 --> 42:43.294
[sighs]

42:45.396 --> 42:48.432
That's a great painting
of a good king.

42:53.270 --> 42:55.272
Okay, everybody,
it's lights out.

42:55.372 --> 42:57.308
Let's flip them
little light switches,

42:57.408 --> 42:59.109
Hey, Gruffneck, lights out.

42:59.209 --> 43:01.579
Kragdor, Rebecca,
I know you heard me.

43:01.645 --> 43:02.646
Lights out.

43:02.746 --> 43:04.415
You too, Naughty Johnny.

43:04.481 --> 43:06.817
Let's see them
lights out. Attaboy.

43:06.917 --> 43:08.619
You, in there. Lights out.

43:08.719 --> 43:09.753
Yeah, Yeah.

43:10.754 --> 43:12.489
Hey.

43:12.590 --> 43:16.327
Anyone ever tell you
you look just like
the old king, Ocean Master?

43:16.427 --> 43:18.929
I am Ocean Master.

43:18.996 --> 43:21.332
My greatness is unmistakable.

43:21.432 --> 43:24.568
Even have a little mole
on my left cheek, see.

43:24.635 --> 43:28.305
Oh, yeah. I've never had
a celebrity in my jail. Neat.

43:28.405 --> 43:32.576
Hey, remember when you
stole Aquaman's trident?
That was so funny.

43:32.643 --> 43:34.111
[chuckles]

43:34.178 --> 43:36.814
It was funny, and worth it,
that's the important part.

43:36.914 --> 43:38.582
Totally worth it.

43:38.649 --> 43:40.017
[coughs]

43:40.117 --> 43:42.620
Whatever happened with that,
besides the jail part?

43:42.686 --> 43:44.421
You know how it is.

43:44.488 --> 43:46.757
I was abducted
by a sentient island.

43:46.824 --> 43:48.092
Yeah, that'll happen.

43:48.158 --> 43:49.860
And, I would have
kicked that island's butt

43:49.960 --> 43:54.264
if he didn't have that stupid,
time distorting, red crystal.

43:54.331 --> 43:56.133
Them's the brakes, I guess.

43:56.200 --> 43:58.168
Well, enjoy jail,
but not too much,

43:58.268 --> 44:00.004
because, then,
they get mad at me.

44:04.274 --> 44:07.611
Ah! Worth it, all worth it.

44:07.678 --> 44:11.215
[ominous voice] Did I hear you
speak of red crystal?

44:11.315 --> 44:14.718
I would like to hear
more about this.

44:14.818 --> 44:16.353
[laughs maniacally]

44:24.828 --> 44:25.663
[farts]
