she has in.

her for now.

- I'm afraid she's not out
of the woods yet.

03:17.698 --> 03:19.467
- Hypothermia and hypoxia?

03:19.467 --> 03:21.435
That's like hibernation.

03:21.435 --> 03:24.905
- It's, like, minus 60
to 70 up there.

03:24.905 --> 03:26.840
What kind of screwed up
life did she have

03:26.840 --> 03:28.809
that she took a risk like that?

03:28.809 --> 03:29.977
- Hey, no offense,

but not everyone's
born a Rhodes.

has fractured his left clavicle,

to make sure.

all that money?

04:28.836 --> 04:31.439

honoring his late wife?

04:37.745 --> 04:40.581
- Man who likes to be
in the center of attention.

04:40.581 --> 04:42.883
- Freaking world-class
narcissist, that guy.

04:42.883 --> 04:45.252
- Yeah, and what better way
to steal the spotlight

04:45.252 --> 04:48.622
from his son than
by donating a million dollars?

04:48.622 --> 04:50.991

the money's green.

04:50.991 --> 04:52.826

How you feeling?

05:00.000 --> 05:02.135
- Wonderful, you know,
considering the fact

05:02.135 --> 05:03.871
that I can't sleep longer
than 15 minutes,

05:03.871 --> 05:05.439
and when I do actually
get comfortable,

05:05.439 --> 05:06.440
I have to pee.

05:06.440 --> 05:07.541
- Fun!
- Yup.

05:07.541 --> 05:08.976

that pillow I gave you?

05:08.976 --> 05:10.544
- Yes.

05:10.544 --> 05:12.913
I added to the 20 other pillows
that aren't helping me sleep,

05:12.913 --> 05:13.914

you slipped out
of the dark quiet,

08:13.994 --> 08:16.196
where suddenly you could hear.

08:16.196 --> 08:18.431
- Parker's fracture is aligned,

08:18.431 --> 08:20.701
which means
he will not need surgery.

08:20.701 --> 08:21.802
- Are you gonna
put a cast on?

08:21.802 --> 08:23.136
- I want a cast!

08:23.136 --> 08:25.973

all you get is a sling.

Hey, well, I heard someone broke
his collarbone this morning.

08:31.645 --> 08:33.179
Hey, buddy!

08:33.179 --> 08:35.482
- I was just telling them that
their son won't need surgery.

08:35.482 --> 08:37.284
- All right, well,
let me take a look.

08:37.284 --> 08:38.318
Hi, Parker.

08:38.318 --> 08:40.220
Do you mind if I check
your pulse?

Yeah?

Thank you.

- Give me 1 milligram of Ativan.

09:13.386 --> 09:15.255
but I don't think
it's related to his clavicle.

With your permission,
I'd like to run some tests

09:31.672 --> 09:32.973
- Thanks for coming,
Dr. Rhodes.

09:32.973 --> 09:37.177
These are agents
McManus and Ramirez

09:37.177 --> 09:39.112
from Homeland Security.

09:39.112 --> 09:41.248
- Dr. Rhodes, you have
a female patient,

09:41.248 --> 09:42.282
a stowaway?

09:42.282 --> 09:44.051
- Yes, Maria Gonzalez.

09:44.051 --> 09:45.653
- And she was brought in
with a companion?

09:45.653 --> 09:46.654
- She was.

09:46.654 --> 09:47.921
Miguel, her brother.

09:47.921 --> 09:49.089
- Her brother?

09:49.089 --> 09:50.858
- We understand he's
unconscious in the ICU.

09:50.858 --> 09:52.025
- Mm-hmm.

09:52.025 --> 09:53.894
- We would like
to talk to Miss Gonzalez.

09:53.894 --> 09:56.997
- Well, I'm afraid that
she's barely conscious herself.

09:56.997 --> 10:00.267
She's in no condition
to be questioned right now.

10:00.267 --> 10:02.870
- Any idea when we'd be able
to talk to Miss Gonzalez?

10:02.870 --> 10:04.938
- It's too early to say.

10:04.938 --> 10:07.040
This woman is a victim.

10:07.040 --> 10:09.109
Her father is a narco.

10:09.109 --> 10:10.811
He was planning
on selling her.

10:10.811 --> 10:12.780
Her brother was only
trying to save her.

10:12.780 --> 10:14.614
- Sounds like you had
extensive conversations

10:14.614 --> 10:16.917
with the semi-conscious
Miss Gonzalez.

10:16.917 --> 10:19.386
- No, that's all I know.

10:19.386 --> 10:21.554
- Dr. Rhodes, you realize
we wouldn't be here

10:21.554 --> 10:23.223
if this weren't a matter
of great concern?

10:23.223 --> 10:26.093
- Yes, and he'll let you know
as soon as you can speak to her.

10:27.427 --> 10:28.461
- Thanks.

10:30.430 --> 10:32.132
We'll be back.

10:35.468 --> 10:38.371
- And you can count on that.

10:44.211 --> 10:46.013
- I'm trying to make this
look pretty, Cedric,

10:46.013 --> 10:47.915
but I'm afraid you're
still gonna have a scar.

10:47.915 --> 10:49.049
- That's a good thing, Doc.

10:49.049 --> 10:50.617
Bigger the better.
Makes my case.

10:50.617 --> 10:52.019
- What do you mean?

10:52.019 --> 10:54.722
- Well, you see, my pops doesn't
want me to have a car.

10:54.722 --> 10:56.089
Now I can say,

10:56.089 --> 10:59.927
"See, if I had been in my
ride instead of on my bike,

10:59.927 --> 11:01.394
I wouldn't have this scar."

11:01.394 --> 11:03.396
- Or if you'd been
wearing your helmet.

11:03.396 --> 11:05.733
- Doc, don't confuse the issue.

11:05.733 --> 11:07.067
- What do you think?

11:07.067 --> 11:08.501
That gonna do the trick?

11:08.501 --> 11:09.837
- Oh, yeah.

11:09.837 --> 11:11.905
That's a Honda scar.

11:11.905 --> 11:14.007
- We aim to please.

11:14.007 --> 11:15.909
You are good to go.

11:15.909 --> 11:16.944
- Thanks, Doc.

11:16.944 --> 11:18.545
- No problem.
She'll sign you out.

11:19.747 --> 11:21.614
[pager beeps]

11:21.614 --> 11:22.883
- Dr. Choi to ICU.

11:22.883 --> 11:24.117
[monitor flatlining]

11:24.117 --> 11:26.053
- Hold compressions.

11:26.053 --> 11:27.287
- What happened?

11:27.287 --> 11:28.388
- We lost him.

11:28.388 --> 11:30.423
Time of death: 11:32.

11:31.391 --> 11:33.460
- Damn.

11:33.460 --> 11:35.328
Want me to tell his sister?

11:36.797 --> 11:38.598
- No, I will.

Mis piernas!

11:49.242 --> 11:50.778
- ¿Te duele?

11:50.778 --> 11:52.112
¿Dónde?
- Mis piernas!

11:52.112 --> 11:53.280
- What's going on?

11:53.280 --> 11:56.449
- Hard as a rock.

11:56.449 --> 11:58.018
- Compartment syndrome.

11:58.018 --> 11:59.119
She must have injured her leg

11:59.119 --> 12:00.788
when she was unconscious
in the plane.

12:00.788 --> 12:01.789
- I don't feel a pulse.

12:01.789 --> 12:02.790
- Get me a Stryker needle.

12:02.790 --> 12:03.891
Let's evaluate the pressure.

12:03.891 --> 12:05.225
- No, no, no,
we are past that.

12:05.225 --> 12:07.294
She needs all four compartments
released right now,

12:07.294 --> 12:08.595
or she's gonna lose this leg.

12:08.595 --> 12:10.898
Call the OR and tell 'em
we're on our way up now.

12:10.898 --> 12:11.999
- Fentanyl?

12:11.999 --> 12:14.034
- 100 mics.
We need repeat labs stat.

12:14.034 --> 12:15.668
CBC, lytes, and a CPK.

12:15.668 --> 12:17.404
- [moans]

12:17.404 --> 12:19.706
- ORs are busy,
at least a two-hour wait.

12:19.706 --> 12:21.008
- That's too long.

12:21.008 --> 12:23.076
We're gonna do
the fasciotomies here.

12:23.076 --> 12:25.712
Draw up to syringes of ketamine,
70 milligrams apiece,

12:25.712 --> 12:26.980
and get me 2 of Versed.

12:26.980 --> 12:28.882
- Whoa, wait.
You're not gonna intubate her?

12:28.882 --> 12:30.117
- Not necessary.

12:30.117 --> 12:31.551
We can do this
with deep sedation.

12:31.551 --> 12:33.120
- The ketamine
won't give you much time.

12:33.120 --> 12:34.822
- Well, then I will be fast.

12:34.822 --> 12:38.725
- [yelling]

12:38.725 --> 12:41.461
Mi hermano Miguel.

12:41.461 --> 12:43.663
- Give her the Versed,
follow it up with the ketamine.

12:43.663 --> 12:44.932
- On it.

12:47.134 --> 12:48.969
BP's 120 over 82.

13:08.421 --> 13:11.458
I'm going for
the posterior compartment now.

13:11.458 --> 13:12.692
Keep her still.

13:12.692 --> 13:14.227
- I'm telling you
we should be in the OR.

13:14.227 --> 13:16.629
- Just suction her out.

13:16.629 --> 13:18.131
April, 70 more of ketamine,

13:18.131 --> 13:19.933
and then come down here
and help hold the leg.

13:19.933 --> 13:22.335
- Got it.

13:22.335 --> 13:24.872
Second dose is...

13:24.872 --> 13:26.073
in.

13:40.053 --> 13:43.423
Okay.

13:43.423 --> 13:45.893
Muscle looks viable,
bleeds well.

13:45.893 --> 13:46.894
That should do it.

13:46.894 --> 13:49.729
Wrap her up.
Send her up to the ICU.

13:49.729 --> 13:52.299
- Got it.

13:52.299 --> 13:54.034
- Let me know when she's alert.

13:54.034 --> 13:56.169
I need to talk to her.

Her brother just died.

14:04.177 --> 14:06.246
You listen to me.

14:06.246 --> 14:07.647
When we are under
the gun like that,

14:07.647 --> 14:09.917
it doesn't help to keep
questioning my decisions.

14:09.917 --> 14:11.351
You follow my lead.

14:18.391 --> 14:19.826
- Guy's father
writes a big check

14:19.826 --> 14:22.029
and he acts like
he owns the joint.

14:22.029 --> 14:24.697
- How about you cut him
some slack today?

14:24.697 --> 14:26.399
- Look, my mother died too.

14:26.399 --> 14:29.202
She's not getting commemorated
with a new hospital ward, okay?

14:30.938 --> 14:33.573
- I thought you said
you grew up in Chicago.

14:33.573 --> 14:35.943
- Southside.
Canaryville.

14:35.943 --> 14:37.277
- Ah.

14:37.277 --> 14:38.946
And you mean to tell me
that you don't know

14:38.946 --> 14:40.647
what happened
to Connor's mother?

14:40.647 --> 14:41.949
- Nope.

14:44.617 --> 14:46.319
- Well, it was 20 years ago.

14:46.319 --> 14:48.788
You were just a kid.

14:48.788 --> 14:52.825
Connor's mom threw herself
off the roof of their home.

14:52.825 --> 14:55.228
Three stories.

14:55.228 --> 14:56.496
Connor was just ten.

15:01.101 --> 15:02.102
- Are you serious?

15:02.102 --> 15:03.436
- Mm-hmm.

15:03.436 --> 15:05.338
It was all over the news
back in the day.

15:09.142 --> 15:12.345
And with the reception
tonight...

15:12.345 --> 15:14.414
lot of stuff that he probably

15:14.414 --> 15:16.583
doesn't want to
have to think about.

test results back.

15:25.725 --> 15:26.859
- And?

15:26.859 --> 15:28.361
- You need to take a look.

15:28.361 --> 15:29.529
Here.

15:31.464 --> 15:33.233
- CT negative.
We need to order--

15:33.233 --> 15:34.234
- An MRI, I know.

15:34.234 --> 15:36.236
I already did it.

15:36.236 --> 15:38.505
It shows excessive
demyelination.

15:38.505 --> 15:42.009
- Explains the clumsiness,
degeneration of motor skills...

15:42.009 --> 15:43.210
- And the seizure.

15:43.210 --> 15:44.644
I don't want to jump
to conclusions,

15:44.644 --> 15:45.712
but I'm pretty sure he has--

15:45.712 --> 15:46.879
- Krabbe Disease.

15:46.879 --> 15:48.015
- Yeah.

15:48.015 --> 15:50.683
He's eight,
so it's late-onset.

15:50.683 --> 15:52.119
- Gives him five
to seven years

15:52.119 --> 15:53.686
before he becomes
confined to a bed

15:53.686 --> 15:55.488
and completely vegetative.

16:00.127 --> 16:02.562
- Well, I've got
to go talk to the par--

16:04.631 --> 16:06.033
- Dr. Manning?

16:06.033 --> 16:07.800
You okay?

16:07.800 --> 16:10.703
- No.

16:10.703 --> 16:12.405
I think my water just broke.

16:13.673 --> 16:15.375
- Oh, my God.
It did.

16:15.375 --> 16:17.110
- I guess this
is happening today.

16:17.110 --> 16:18.711
- Uh, can we get
a wheelchair over here?

16:18.711 --> 16:19.779
- Look, I'm sorry, Sarah,

16:19.779 --> 16:21.181
but you have to go
tell the parents.

16:21.181 --> 16:22.182
- What? Me?
No. I can't--

16:22.182 --> 16:23.183
- You have to.

16:23.183 --> 16:24.351
- I don't have the experience.

16:24.351 --> 16:25.352
- Go get Dr. Charles.

16:25.352 --> 16:26.386
He will help you.

16:26.386 --> 16:28.355
I have to go have this baby now.

How much longer do
we have to do this?

16:56.483 --> 16:58.185
- Ten more laps.
- Ugh.

16:58.185 --> 17:00.720
- Make sure everything gets
aligned correctly down there.

17:00.720 --> 17:02.389
- You know,
I am seriously regretting

17:02.389 --> 17:03.790
making you my birthing coach.

17:03.790 --> 17:04.790
- Good.

17:04.790 --> 17:06.559
That means I'm doing my job.

17:06.559 --> 17:07.926
Oh, hey, handsome!

17:07.926 --> 17:09.396
Get yourself over here.

17:09.396 --> 17:10.430
- Sorry.
- Hi.

17:10.430 --> 17:12.765
- I had to bribe Fromson
to cover my shift.

17:12.765 --> 17:14.534
What do you need me to do?

17:14.534 --> 17:16.803
- Okay, I need you
to walk with her for now

17:16.803 --> 17:18.171
and be her rock.

17:18.171 --> 17:20.373
And I will be back
as soon as I can.

17:20.373 --> 17:21.508
- Wait, you're leaving?

17:21.508 --> 17:23.109
- Got to find somebody
to cover my desk.

17:23.109 --> 17:24.111
Yup.

17:24.111 --> 17:25.578
We could be here
for the next 30 hours.

17:25.578 --> 17:26.945
- 30 hours?
No.

17:26.945 --> 17:29.382
- Not if you listen
to your birthing coach.

17:35.122 --> 17:36.856
- [exhales]

17:36.856 --> 17:40.293

a rock is supposed to walk.

17:40.293 --> 17:43.263
- You're doing just fine.

17:43.263 --> 17:45.298
Thank you for being here.

18:05.718 --> 18:06.719
- Will.

18:06.719 --> 18:07.720

Sorry I'm late.

18:25.405 --> 18:28.541
- Thanks for coming, Sharon.

18:28.541 --> 18:32.179
- A meeting without
a single doctor present?

18:32.179 --> 18:35.615
My guess is this isn't
about a medical issue.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.484
- Peter?

18:37.484 --> 18:41.188
- Sharon, I know
you're not gonna like this--

18:41.188 --> 18:43.923
neither do we--
but we need to discuss

18:43.923 --> 18:45.858
our stowaway patient.

18:50.830 --> 18:52.565
- Dr. Charles?

18:52.565 --> 18:54.334
Dr. Manning said
you could help me.

18:54.334 --> 18:55.802
- What's up?

18:58.070 --> 19:00.840
- I have a patient,
an eight-year-old boy,

19:00.840 --> 19:03.710
Parker Kindler, and...

19:03.710 --> 19:05.945
uh...

19:05.945 --> 19:08.248
You know what,
let me back up for a second.

19:08.248 --> 19:10.317
Dr. Manning and I
were treating Parker,

19:10.317 --> 19:12.352
and then she went
into labor, and--

19:12.352 --> 19:13.353
- Natalie's in labor?

19:13.353 --> 19:14.354
- Mm-hmm.

19:14.354 --> 19:15.355
- How's she doing?

19:15.355 --> 19:16.423
- Fine, I suppose.

19:16.423 --> 19:17.857
Her water broke right
in front of me,

19:17.857 --> 19:21.060
but that's not what
I came to talk to you about.

19:21.060 --> 19:22.429
- Okay.

19:24.497 --> 19:26.833
- Dr. Manning and I
just diagnosed Parker

19:26.833 --> 19:29.836
with a terminal genetic
condition called Krabbe Disease,

19:29.836 --> 19:34.073
and now she's in labor,
and I have to tell the parents

19:34.073 --> 19:37.076
that their eight-year-old child
is going to die,

19:37.076 --> 19:39.879
and that the same thing might
happen to their three-year-old.

19:39.879 --> 19:42.515
So I guess I was just
wondering...

19:42.515 --> 19:44.551
how do--
how do I do that?

19:46.586 --> 19:47.687
- Have a seat.

19:47.687 --> 19:49.322
- Yeah.

19:52.959 --> 19:55.728
- [slurping]

19:55.728 --> 19:57.697
In my experience,
it's best to be direct

19:57.697 --> 19:59.566
and get straight
to the point.

19:59.566 --> 20:01.668
When people get
bad news like this,

20:01.668 --> 20:04.170
they tend to get overwhelmed.

20:04.170 --> 20:06.939
They might ask you
to clarify things

20:06.939 --> 20:09.041
or repeat them.

20:09.041 --> 20:10.277
You know...

20:10.277 --> 20:12.312
They might seem like
they have a million questions.

20:12.312 --> 20:14.714
They might want
to be left alone

20:14.714 --> 20:18.618
to begin to process
the grief.

20:18.618 --> 20:19.952
The most important thing

20:19.952 --> 20:22.221
is that they need to know
that somebody's there

20:22.221 --> 20:24.023
who understands
what they're going through.

20:24.023 --> 20:25.492
You know...

20:25.492 --> 20:29.996
So really it's your compassion
that they need to feel.

20:29.996 --> 20:31.531
- Compassion.

20:31.531 --> 20:32.865
- Yeah.

20:32.865 --> 20:36.369
And after you tell
the parents...

20:36.369 --> 20:40.072
they might want you there
when they tell the child.

20:40.072 --> 20:41.073
They might not.

20:41.073 --> 20:42.108
That's up to them.

20:44.277 --> 20:45.878
- Wait.
Tell the child?

20:45.878 --> 20:47.614
- Oh, yeah.

20:47.614 --> 20:50.650
The child actually
needs to know.

20:52.819 --> 20:53.986
- [quietly]
Okay.

20:53.986 --> 20:57.424
- Look, Sarah,
it's the hardest thing

20:57.424 --> 20:59.992
that you'll have to do
as a doctor, right?

20:59.992 --> 21:01.561
And it doesn't get any easier.

21:01.561 --> 21:04.764
At least, it hasn't for me.

21:04.764 --> 21:08.335
But we are the ones

21:08.335 --> 21:11.203
who have been chosen
to do this,

21:11.203 --> 21:14.474
and I think that there's
a certain nobility in that.

21:17.444 --> 21:20.012
Okay?

21:20.012 --> 21:21.047
Good.

21:23.583 --> 21:26.619
[slurping]

21:30.122 --> 21:31.358
You want me to come along?

21:31.358 --> 21:32.759
- That would be great.

21:32.759 --> 21:34.694
Thank you.

21:34.694 --> 21:36.363
Given his current symptoms,

21:36.363 --> 21:39.366
Parker has anywhere
from five to seven years

21:39.366 --> 21:42.201
before the progressively
degenerative nature

21:42.201 --> 21:44.871
of the disease
confines him to a bed

21:44.871 --> 21:48.140
and eventually leaves him
in a vegetative state.

21:49.609 --> 21:52.211
- I mean, there must
be some kind of treatment.

21:57.450 --> 21:59.652
- At the moment, no.

21:59.652 --> 22:01.053
- You mean there's no cure?

22:01.053 --> 22:04.657
There's nothing we can do?

22:04.657 --> 22:08.828
- Um...

22:08.828 --> 22:10.196
that is correct.

22:10.196 --> 22:12.465
Krabbe is an extremely
rare disease.

22:12.465 --> 22:14.233
We can treat his symptoms,

22:14.233 --> 22:16.102
but eventually Parker will need

22:16.102 --> 22:18.505
to be ventilated
to continue living.

22:18.505 --> 22:21.040
- [sobbing quietly]

22:21.040 --> 22:24.076
[sniffling]

22:27.046 --> 22:29.582
- There is something else.

22:29.582 --> 22:32.419
Since the disease
is hereditary,

22:32.419 --> 22:35.755
we need to determine
if Seth carries it as well.

22:35.755 --> 22:37.557
Do you know
if he's been tested?

22:37.557 --> 22:39.025
- Seth?

22:39.025 --> 22:40.893
I don't remember.

22:40.893 --> 22:42.529
- That's okay.

22:42.529 --> 22:43.730
I can find out.

22:43.730 --> 22:45.632
Do I have permission
to check his natal records?

22:45.632 --> 22:47.500
- Of course.

22:47.500 --> 22:50.437
- What happens
if Seth tests positive?

22:54.507 --> 22:59.345
- Since he has not yet
presented symptoms,

22:59.345 --> 23:04.083
the hope is we can treat him
with stem cells

23:04.083 --> 23:08.054
and stop him from
developing the disease.

23:08.054 --> 23:09.255
- The hope?

23:09.255 --> 23:11.991
- Why don't we check
the records first

23:11.991 --> 23:13.860
and--and go from there?

23:20.366 --> 23:24.170
- [sniffling]

23:24.170 --> 23:25.838
- Again, I'm so sorry.

23:52.198 --> 23:53.199
Excuse me.

23:53.199 --> 23:56.202
[somber music]

23:56.202 --> 23:58.938

23:58.938 --> 23:59.972
Okay.

[exhales]

[sobbing]

24:17.524 --> 24:20.560
[breathing heavily]

24:38.410 --> 24:40.813
- Oz, turn the room over.

24:40.813 --> 24:42.248
- Whoa.
What happened to my patient?

24:42.248 --> 24:44.851
- The Air Ambulance medics came
to take Ms. Gonzalez away.

24:44.851 --> 24:45.985
- What?

24:45.985 --> 24:47.153
- They just left.

24:49.288 --> 24:52.291
[dramatic music]

24:52.291 --> 24:56.162

24:56.162 --> 24:57.163
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

24:57.163 --> 24:58.665
What are you doing
with my patient?

24:58.665 --> 25:00.299
- All right, Doc, please,
it's best you stay out of this.

25:00.299 --> 25:01.367
- No, no, no.
She is under my care.

25:01.367 --> 25:03.102
She--Maria!
- Dr. Rhodes, por favor!

25:03.102 --> 25:04.403
- Are okay?
- Let's keep him back.

25:04.403 --> 25:05.972
- You get off of me.

25:05.972 --> 25:08.107
- I'm sorry, but she's
being repatriated home.

25:08.107 --> 25:09.108
- No, she is barely stable.

25:09.108 --> 25:10.109
She can't go anywhere.

25:10.109 --> 25:11.410
- She's stable enough to travel.

25:11.410 --> 25:13.245
She's gonna be accompanied
by a doctor and a nurse.

25:13.245 --> 25:14.480
- No, no, no.
I can't allow this.

25:14.480 --> 25:15.481
- Doctor, I'm sorry.

25:15.481 --> 25:16.783
This is not up to you.

25:20.219 --> 25:23.222
[siren blares]

[indistinct speech over PA]

25:36.335 --> 25:39.839
[elevator dinging]

25:39.839 --> 25:40.840
- Mrs. Goodwin?

25:40.840 --> 25:41.874
- Yeah.

25:41.874 --> 25:43.610
- You backed me up
with Homeland Security.

25:43.610 --> 25:44.711
- Yes, I did.

25:44.711 --> 25:47.647
- Then why did you let
them deport Maria Gonzalez?

25:48.881 --> 25:50.617
- Not here, Dr. Rhodes.

25:52.852 --> 25:54.220
Give us the room.

25:57.323 --> 25:58.457
- Hmm?

25:58.457 --> 26:00.693
- Homeland Security
did not deport your patient.

26:00.693 --> 26:01.828
- No, no, no.
I was outside.

26:01.828 --> 26:03.062
I saw them.

26:03.062 --> 26:06.633
- It's the hospital
that's repatriating her.

26:06.633 --> 26:07.767
- The hospital?

26:07.767 --> 26:09.769
Why--we're doing this why?

26:09.769 --> 26:12.504
- Because Maria Gonzalez
is undocumented

26:12.504 --> 26:14.641
and without
medical insurance.

26:14.641 --> 26:15.975
- We're legally bound
to treat her.

26:15.975 --> 26:17.043
- Which we have done.

26:17.043 --> 26:19.211
- She is still
in critical condition.

26:19.211 --> 26:22.114
- We contract with a private
ambulance service.

26:22.114 --> 26:25.217
They provide medical personnel
for the patient.

26:25.217 --> 26:26.552
- That's how you
justify it, then?

26:26.552 --> 26:29.255
- Look, I wish I could wave
a magic wand and fix it,

26:29.255 --> 26:30.289
but I can't.

26:30.289 --> 26:32.925
- Maria came her for refuge.

26:32.925 --> 26:36.262
Her brother risked everything
so that he could help her,

26:36.262 --> 26:38.965
and he sacrificed his life.

26:38.965 --> 26:39.966
For what?

26:39.966 --> 26:42.702
For nothing.

26:42.702 --> 26:43.970
- Dr. Rhodes.

26:49.408 --> 26:50.877
Damn.

26:53.846 --> 26:55.314
- There was meconium
in your water,

26:55.314 --> 26:58.184
so we'll want to watch for fetal
aspiration during delivery.

26:58.184 --> 26:59.919
- Okay.

26:59.919 --> 27:01.420
Oof.

27:01.420 --> 27:03.255
- Your dilation
is 4 centimeters.

27:03.255 --> 27:05.792
So--looks like
you're on your way.

27:06.959 --> 27:08.961
Dr. Halstead,
you can come in now.

27:12.732 --> 27:14.734
- How you doing?

27:14.734 --> 27:17.203
- I'm okay.
Mm.

27:17.203 --> 27:19.471
- All right,
I got Betty to cover the desk.

27:19.471 --> 27:20.807
I'm here for the duration.

27:20.807 --> 27:22.742
What do you need?

27:22.742 --> 27:24.744
- I'm really thirsty.
- Okay.

27:24.744 --> 27:26.713
- I'll get you some ice chips.
- Oh, thank you.

27:26.713 --> 27:27.880
- All right, thank you.

27:27.880 --> 27:30.817
Let me fluff
that pillow for you.

- Will?

27:45.197 --> 27:46.232
- Yeah.

- Natalie's husband,

27:50.536 --> 27:53.339
my son, Jeff...

27:53.339 --> 27:55.842
died seven months ago.

27:57.043 --> 27:58.878
- Yeah, I'm very sorry
for your loss.

27:58.878 --> 28:01.347
- Only seven months.

28:04.817 --> 28:06.552
What are you doing?

28:06.552 --> 28:08.187
- I'm...

28:08.187 --> 28:10.422
just trying to help.

28:10.422 --> 28:11.758
Natalie and I are friends.

28:11.758 --> 28:12.992

28:12.992 --> 28:14.060
- And colleagues.

28:14.060 --> 28:15.561
- And that's it?

28:15.561 --> 28:17.063
- Of course.

28:17.063 --> 28:18.765
I care about her.

28:21.467 --> 28:23.435
- Natalie's having a baby.

28:23.435 --> 28:25.204
She's a widow.

28:25.204 --> 28:26.806
She's vulnerable.

28:34.847 --> 28:36.783

give that to her?

Tell her I'll be back later.

Triple zero.
Three entry wounds in the chest.

He's shredded.

16-gauge IV in the right AC.

Downtime 12 minutes.

Milligram of epi.

I know him.

Cedric.

30:14.513 --> 30:16.548
He fell off his bike.

you've been asking

30:27.593 --> 30:30.997
why Seth had to get a test.

30:30.997 --> 30:33.265
And why your dad and I

Yes.

There is, and we need
to tell you about it.

30:45.277 --> 30:47.679

30:47.679 --> 30:50.182

Dr. Charles to help us

explain it very well.

- 'Cause he's a doctor.

30:54.753 --> 30:55.922
- Right.

30:59.892 --> 31:02.394
- It turns out,
honey, that...

31:05.397 --> 31:06.532
You're sick.

31:06.532 --> 31:08.734
- You mean this?

31:08.734 --> 31:11.337
- No.

31:11.337 --> 31:14.040
Something more.

31:14.040 --> 31:18.210
- You mean,
like when I get a cold?

31:18.210 --> 31:19.245
- No.

31:23.815 --> 31:24.984
Please.

31:27.719 --> 31:30.756
- Parker...

31:30.756 --> 31:34.093
you are sick
in a different way.

31:34.093 --> 31:36.963
- So should we check
to see if I have a temperature?

31:36.963 --> 31:38.965
- Mm, we don't have to.

31:38.965 --> 31:40.466
You don't.

31:40.466 --> 31:43.335
- Does that mean
I'm getting better?

31:43.335 --> 31:46.205
- No, buddy, it doesn't.
I'm sorry.

31:46.205 --> 31:49.408
Unfortunately,
you have an illness

31:49.408 --> 31:52.011
that we don't have
a cure for yet.

31:52.011 --> 31:54.380
- Is this like
when Finn got sick?

31:57.483 --> 31:58.985
Finn was my dog.

31:58.985 --> 32:01.020
- Oh, you had a dog?

32:01.020 --> 32:02.088
- Uh-huh.

32:02.088 --> 32:04.123
He died.

32:05.724 --> 32:07.493
Am I gonna die too?

32:09.728 --> 32:11.430
- Yeah.

32:11.430 --> 32:13.132
You are.

32:13.132 --> 32:16.268
But not for a long time.

32:16.268 --> 32:17.269
- A year?

32:17.269 --> 32:20.006
- Oh, longer than that.

32:20.006 --> 32:22.474
More like five years.

32:22.474 --> 32:23.875
- That's a long time.

32:23.875 --> 32:25.111
- Yeah.

32:25.111 --> 32:26.878
- Will I get to eat ice cream?

32:26.878 --> 32:28.780
- I'm guessing...

32:28.780 --> 32:30.449
the answer might be yes.

32:37.023 --> 32:40.026
- Push! Push, push!
- [screaming]

32:40.026 --> 32:43.029
[gasping]

32:44.563 --> 32:45.564
Where's Will?

32:45.564 --> 32:46.798
- I don't know.

32:46.798 --> 32:49.101
Don't worry.
Maggie and I are here with you.

32:49.101 --> 32:51.170
- [screams]

32:51.170 --> 32:52.204
- Your BP is rising.

32:53.405 --> 32:54.540
- It's still okay, right?

32:54.540 --> 32:55.774
- The baby's not descending.

32:55.774 --> 32:57.376
I'm worried that
he's occiput posterior

32:57.376 --> 32:58.477
and stuck in the birth canal.

32:58.477 --> 32:59.578
- What does that mean?

32:59.578 --> 33:01.413
- The baby is sunny-side up.
- Breathe.

33:01.413 --> 33:02.814
- We need to consider
a C-section.

33:02.814 --> 33:04.050
- A C-section?

33:04.050 --> 33:05.484
- Is it that serious?
Is the baby in danger?

33:05.484 --> 33:06.818
- Ma'am, I'm sorry,

33:06.818 --> 33:08.554
but I think it would be better
if you waited outside.

33:08.554 --> 33:09.855
- No, I'm not leaving.

33:09.855 --> 33:10.856
- Helen, it's okay.

33:10.856 --> 33:13.459
I'm fine.
I promise.

33:13.459 --> 33:14.460
- Ma'am.

33:14.460 --> 33:17.096
- Okay, if you're sure.
- Yes.

33:17.096 --> 33:18.197
- I got this, Helen.
- Ma'am?

33:18.197 --> 33:19.831
- I'll be right outside.

33:19.831 --> 33:22.868
- [grunting and moaning]

33:23.869 --> 33:25.104
I don't want a C-section.

33:25.104 --> 33:26.205
- I don't blame you.

33:26.205 --> 33:27.473
- I think you're being
overly cautious.

33:27.473 --> 33:28.940
That 'cause you're
treating another doctor?

33:28.940 --> 33:30.642
- I treat all my
patients the same.

33:30.642 --> 33:31.643
- We're not there yet.

33:31.643 --> 33:33.079
- Are you questioning
my judgment?

33:33.079 --> 33:34.546
- I'm her midwife,

33:34.546 --> 33:37.083
and I don't think cutting
into her is a good idea yet.

33:37.083 --> 33:39.351
- Are you going to listen
to her or your obstetrician?

33:39.351 --> 33:41.153
- [gasping]

33:41.153 --> 33:43.189
- Nat, I can turn the baby.

33:45.557 --> 33:46.858
- Natalie?

33:46.858 --> 33:48.727
- Nat?

33:48.727 --> 33:51.097
- Let her try.

33:56.202 --> 33:56.335
.

33:56.935 --> 33:57.336

Give me ultrasound.

34:05.844 --> 34:08.880
[monitor beeps]

34:13.319 --> 34:16.522
- Heart rate's decelerating.

34:16.522 --> 34:17.822
Baby's still OP.

34:17.822 --> 34:18.824
We should operate.

34:18.824 --> 34:20.659
- Not yet.

34:20.659 --> 34:22.027
One more time.
Okay, Nat?

34:22.027 --> 34:25.130
[monitor beeps]

34:26.132 --> 34:27.132
Breathe.

34:27.132 --> 34:28.534
Breathe.
Breathe!

34:30.802 --> 34:32.003
Try it now.

34:32.003 --> 34:33.139
I think we have it.

34:35.541 --> 34:36.908
- Yes!

34:36.908 --> 34:38.810
- Okay, he's in position.

34:38.810 --> 34:41.380
Okay?
Okay.

34:41.380 --> 34:43.149
Okay.

34:43.149 --> 34:44.783
Give me a push.
Now!

34:44.783 --> 34:46.851
- [screams]

34:48.987 --> 34:52.391

That's it.

Push!

The baby's crowning.
The baby's crowning.

We're almost there.

34:57.929 --> 34:59.265
Okay.

34:59.265 --> 35:00.499
- I'm so tired.

35:00.499 --> 35:02.201
- Listen to me, okay?

35:02.201 --> 35:04.403
You can do this.

35:04.403 --> 35:06.338
Okay?
Okay?

35:06.338 --> 35:07.339
Wait a second.

35:07.339 --> 35:08.340
Again.

Three, two, one...

That's it!

That's it.
That's it!

35:18.016 --> 35:19.451
- [moaning]

35:19.451 --> 35:21.387
- Okay, that's it.
Here he is.

35:21.387 --> 35:23.455
- We've got a tight nuchal cord.

35:23.455 --> 35:24.723
- What's happening?

35:24.723 --> 35:27.193
- Baby's not breathing.

35:27.193 --> 35:28.194
- Clip.
Clip.

- What's happening!

35:30.196 --> 35:32.364
- Okay, Nat.
Cut.

35:36.302 --> 35:38.103
- Someone tell
me what's happening!

35:38.103 --> 35:40.439
- Meconium in the airway.

35:40.439 --> 35:41.440
- Suctioning now.

35:41.440 --> 35:44.410
[machine sucking liquid]

35:44.410 --> 35:45.677

They're working on the baby.

over this loop.

Tie them together.

37:25.210 --> 37:27.546
- And...

Seth tested negative
for Krabbe Disease.

Oh, my God.

37:35.721 --> 37:38.324
- We're making a movie.

37:38.324 --> 37:40.659
- Instructional videos
for his brother.

37:40.659 --> 37:42.594
- Things that I learned
when I was little.

37:42.594 --> 37:44.363
In case I get too sick
to teach him.

37:44.363 --> 37:47.032
- That's really nice.

37:47.032 --> 37:48.967
- Okay.
I got something to do...

- Uh-huh.
- But I'll be right back.

37:56.342 --> 37:59.545

how difficult it is

37:59.545 --> 38:02.781

of those who suffer

38:02.781 --> 38:06.352
from mental illness.

38:06.352 --> 38:10.356
22 years ago,
my wife, Elizabeth,

38:10.356 --> 38:13.158
lost her battle
with depression...

38:13.158 --> 38:14.826
and killed herself,

38:14.826 --> 38:16.795
scarring not only me,

38:16.795 --> 38:19.931
but our two children.

38:19.931 --> 38:25.103
Sadly, this kind of tragedy
is not unique to our family,

38:25.103 --> 38:29.074
and therefore, I can
only hope that my donation

38:29.074 --> 38:32.578
helps to ease the suffering,

38:32.578 --> 38:36.014
the feeling of hopelessness,

38:36.014 --> 38:40.552
that we and too many others
have experienced.

Thank you.

38:47.659 --> 38:51.296
So, in memory of my late wife,

38:51.296 --> 38:55.901
I have given $1 million
to help build

38:55.901 --> 38:58.637

Psychiatric Ward.

like his father.

- Yeah.

39:25.230 --> 39:27.098
He really does.

39:31.970 --> 39:33.839
I'm gonna name him Owen.

39:35.507 --> 39:37.743
It's Irish for "little fighter."

39:39.144 --> 39:41.747
Given how he came
into the world.

39:43.582 --> 39:46.618
- Owen.

40:18.750 --> 40:20.919
- I had this patient today.

40:20.919 --> 40:22.521
She came in with her brother,

40:22.521 --> 40:23.855
and he died.

40:27.058 --> 40:28.860
He sacrificed
his life for her.

40:32.230 --> 40:33.899
I never should have
left Claire.

40:36.468 --> 40:37.903
- No.

40:37.903 --> 40:39.805
You shouldn't have.

40:41.707 --> 40:44.175
Hurt her deeply.

40:44.175 --> 40:46.377
- You know, I never told her
about the night that Mom died,

40:46.377 --> 40:49.047
what really happened.

40:54.686 --> 40:57.022
- Your mother was disturbed.

40:57.022 --> 40:58.624
She had a mental illness.

40:58.624 --> 41:01.359
- You and I both know

41:01.359 --> 41:03.762
that that's not the reason
she killed herself.

41:08.166 --> 41:09.901
Let me get this for you.

Hey, Dad.
