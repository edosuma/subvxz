09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
Okay. The sun that brings me out today...

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
Is the very thing that makes me go away.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
Both: What am I?

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
Hmm. A sun shower,

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
like when it rains when it's sunny,

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
but then the sun evaporates the puddles

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
and makes the water go away.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
Wrong.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
A flower in the desert.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
Sun helps it grow, but then it's too hot.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
-Nope. -I don't know, a sad man.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
He comes outside to brighten his day,

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
but then he remembers

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
that the sun will turn into a supernova

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
and destroy the whole universe, so he gets sad.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
Nuh-uh.

09:54.000 --> 09:58.000
Aah! I don't know.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
Ahh. You may pass.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
Yes!

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
Geez. It's hot.

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
Maybe my brain is melting.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
Hey, thanks. Here.

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
Keep thinking about it.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
The sun that brings me out today

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
is the very thing that makes me go away.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
Ow! Ooh, my teethies.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
Oh, I get it.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
It's an ice pop! Woo-hoo!

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
That is so funny. [ Laughing ]

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
Hey. Listen up, everyone.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
We've put our heads together

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
and figured out the best way to run

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
the Trading Tree -- by not running it.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
The Trading Tree is closed forever!

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
Craig: Ice pops, get your ice pops here.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
[ Kids cheering ]

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
They're not free. Bring something to trade later.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
I'm gonna remember all of you.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
Whew, that was close.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
Oh, thanks for the ice pops, guys.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
Both: You bet.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
We did it, partner.

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
So do I get a cut out of this?

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
