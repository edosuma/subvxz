WEBVTT

00:01.102 --> 00:01.234
.

00:01.734 --> 00:03.104
- * Well

00:03.137 --> 00:04.038
* Well, my love

00:04.072 --> 00:08.209
- You think this is a good spot?
[laughter]

00:08.242 --> 00:09.377
- Ah, I'll see you inside.

00:09.410 --> 00:12.780
Remember, if you get any central
lines today, I'm your man.

00:12.813 --> 00:13.947
- And if I don't?

00:13.981 --> 00:17.618
- * Now I'm trying to wake up
from this *

00:17.651 --> 00:20.254
- Honey, you're still bleeding.

00:20.288 --> 00:24.525
Mm, yeah, I think I'll be doing
those central lines myself.

00:24.558 --> 00:26.527
- [chuckles]
Give me a break.

00:26.560 --> 00:27.595
See you.
- [laughs]

00:32.400 --> 00:33.801
- [sighs] The coast is clear.

00:33.834 --> 00:36.137
Save some lives today,
Dr. Halstead.

00:36.170 --> 00:38.239
- I'll try, Dr. Shore,
and you down in path,

00:38.272 --> 00:39.540
enjoy your day with the dead.

00:39.573 --> 00:42.210
- Always do.
[both laugh]

00:42.243 --> 00:45.513
- * We turn our backs
to the wind *

00:51.352 --> 00:53.254
- Hey, you look cheerful today.

00:53.287 --> 00:56.424
- Well, you know, I like
to see the ED as half-full.

00:58.459 --> 01:00.628
- Dr. Halstead, Dr. Manning.

01:00.661 --> 01:04.331
- Clarke.

01:04.364 --> 01:05.566
So how you two doing?

01:05.599 --> 01:07.235
- What?

01:07.268 --> 01:10.138
- You and Jeff.
- What are you talking about?

01:10.171 --> 01:13.174
- Natalie, everyone knows.

01:13.207 --> 01:15.243
It's good.
It's--you know,

01:15.276 --> 01:16.477
you seem a lot happier lately.

01:16.510 --> 01:17.345
It's nice.

01:17.378 --> 01:19.480
- Okay, but when you say
everybody, wh--

01:19.513 --> 01:23.151
- ED staff,
ambulance drivers, EMTs.

01:23.184 --> 01:24.418
- Huh.
- The crazy guy out front

01:24.452 --> 01:26.220
who thinks he's Jesus.

01:26.254 --> 01:30.458
- Okay, so about the same people
who know about you and Nina.

01:30.491 --> 01:33.427
- Wait, seriously?

01:35.196 --> 01:37.465
- Incoming.
- Dr. Choi?

01:37.498 --> 01:40.134
We're going to room two.

01:40.168 --> 01:42.336
- Edward Hall, 82,
he passed out in his apartment,

01:42.370 --> 01:44.405
was awake when we got there,
vitals stable.

01:44.438 --> 01:46.707
- Mr. Hall, how are you feeling?
- Head hurts.

01:46.740 --> 01:47.875
You got an Aspirin?

01:47.908 --> 01:49.510
- He's never done this before.

01:49.543 --> 01:51.679
He was just walking to
the bedroom, and he fell down.

01:51.712 --> 01:53.447
- We're gonna take care of you,
Mr. Hall, okay?

01:53.481 --> 01:57.485
On my count, one, two, three.

01:57.518 --> 01:58.886
Okay, let's get an H and H.

01:58.919 --> 02:00.254
[speaks indistinctly]

02:04.525 --> 02:06.294
Get Dr. Rhodes.
- Okay.

02:06.327 --> 02:09.229
Have you experienced any recent
neck pain, trouble swallowing?

02:09.263 --> 02:11.332
- Swallowing?
- Your neck is swollen.

02:11.365 --> 02:13.367
How long has it been like that?

02:13.401 --> 02:16.637
- I don't--swallowing?
- He's in and out mentally,

02:16.670 --> 02:18.639
mostly out,
but I take care of him.

02:18.672 --> 02:21.375
- Are you his daughter?
- No, I'm his girlfriend.

02:21.409 --> 02:23.377
It's okay, Eddie.
You're gonna be all right.

02:23.411 --> 02:24.945
- What do we got?
- Neck swelling

02:24.978 --> 02:25.979
with a bruit.
I'm thinking there's

02:26.013 --> 02:27.948
a compressive mass in his chest,
possibly a tumor.

02:27.981 --> 02:29.650
- Oh, my God, do you think
he has cancer?

02:29.683 --> 02:30.951
- Could be.

02:30.984 --> 02:32.320
If it's pressing on his heart
or carotids,

02:32.353 --> 02:33.587
that would explain
his passing out.

02:33.621 --> 02:34.688
- And if that's the case,
we're gonna have

02:34.722 --> 02:35.623
to operate to remove it.

02:35.656 --> 02:38.259
- Well, just do whatever
it takes, please.

02:38.292 --> 02:39.627
Just take care of him.

02:39.660 --> 02:41.262
- Tell radiology
we're on our way up

02:41.295 --> 02:43.764
for a neck and chest CT with
contrast, then up to the OR.

02:43.797 --> 02:46.534
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, please stop.
Don't take him anywhere.

02:46.567 --> 02:47.535
- Excuse me, sir,
can I help you?

02:47.568 --> 02:48.936
- This is my father.

02:48.969 --> 02:50.971
He doesn't want any of this.

02:51.004 --> 02:52.373
And that bitch has no right

02:52.406 --> 02:54.508
to make any decisions
about his health.

02:54.542 --> 02:57.511
[dramatic music]

02:57.545 --> 03:04.618
*

03:08.722 --> 03:09.990
- The fact is my father
doesn't want

03:10.023 --> 03:11.592
any extraordinary measures
taken.

03:11.625 --> 03:12.626
- He never said that.

03:12.660 --> 03:13.927
- When his mind
first started to go,

03:13.961 --> 03:15.629
he made his wishes
clear to me.

03:15.663 --> 03:17.898
- Dr. Choi, what are
Mr. Hall's options?

03:17.931 --> 03:19.900
- The scan suggests
he has a thymoma.

03:19.933 --> 03:20.768
If we treat supportively,

03:20.801 --> 03:22.803
he'll probably have four
to six months,

03:22.836 --> 03:25.573
but if we excise the tumor,
we can prolong his life

03:25.606 --> 03:28.909
significantly, as I'm sure
our surgeons can attest.

03:28.942 --> 03:31.545
- Surgery's definitely
an option.

03:34.715 --> 03:35.783
- Yes, uh,

03:35.816 --> 03:38.586
though surgery
does come with risk,

03:38.619 --> 03:41.455
a successful operation
could result in a total cure.

03:41.489 --> 03:43.524
- He's 82 and demented.

03:43.557 --> 03:45.493
You want to put him
through an operation? For what?

03:45.526 --> 03:47.461
- He just said he could live.
- Yeah, and he could be left

03:47.495 --> 03:49.029
hooked up to wires and tubes
for who knows how long?

03:49.062 --> 03:50.464
No.
- You can't do this.

03:50.498 --> 03:51.932
You can't just
let him kill Eddie.

03:51.965 --> 03:54.602
- I am trying to honor
my father's wishes.

03:54.635 --> 03:55.769
- All right, enough.

03:55.803 --> 03:59.740
Look, we all understand this
is a very sensitive issue,

03:59.773 --> 04:03.511
but what matters here is who has
the legal authority

04:03.544 --> 04:06.514
to make Mr. Hall's decisions.

04:06.547 --> 04:08.749
- Well, as far as
the hospital's concerned,

04:08.782 --> 04:10.918
with no advance directive
in place

04:10.951 --> 04:12.920
the surrogate
decision-making power

04:12.953 --> 04:14.054
goes to the next of kin,

04:14.087 --> 04:16.857
which, in this case,
is Mr. Hall's son.

04:16.890 --> 04:18.024
- No.
- Thank you.

04:18.058 --> 04:19.327
- Ms. Goodwin,
all due respect,

04:19.360 --> 04:21.862
but my job is to do whatever it
takes to keep my patients alive.

04:21.894 --> 04:23.063
- Dr. Choi, you heard him.

04:23.096 --> 04:24.765
Our hands are tied.

04:24.798 --> 04:26.567
- So that's it?

04:26.600 --> 04:27.868
You're just gonna
let Eddie die?

04:27.901 --> 04:30.671
- I'm sorry.

04:36.877 --> 04:39.647
- Hey, you got a bounce-back
in three.

04:43.617 --> 04:47.921
- Hey, Haley. Back so soon?
- I was afraid you'd miss me.

04:47.955 --> 04:51.859
- Always. You still throwing up?
- No, that's all better.

04:51.892 --> 04:53.861
- Right after we saw you,
what, three days ago?

04:53.894 --> 04:56.029
She started getting
a fever and chills.

04:56.063 --> 04:58.966
- We tried ibuprofen,
but it didn't come down.

04:58.999 --> 05:00.501
- You did the right thing.

05:00.534 --> 05:01.969
When'd you finish your last
round of chemo?

05:02.002 --> 05:03.937
- Yesterday.
- Usually the chemo fevers

05:03.971 --> 05:06.306
don't last this long.
[beeping]

05:08.542 --> 05:11.512
- Or get this high, 103.

05:11.545 --> 05:12.746
- Do you think
something's wrong?

05:12.780 --> 05:15.749
- Hard to say. The cancer meds
do knock down her immune system,

05:15.783 --> 05:18.018
so I wouldn't be surprised if
she got some sort of infection.

05:18.051 --> 05:20.020
- But probably nothing
to worry about?

05:20.053 --> 05:21.755
- Probably not,
but I would like

05:21.789 --> 05:22.956
to start her
on some antibiotics

05:22.990 --> 05:25.593
and get labs and cultures
just to be safe.

05:25.626 --> 05:27.661
Looks like we'll be spending
a little more time together.

05:29.096 --> 05:31.799
I'll be back shortly.

05:32.800 --> 05:34.502
- Ready to head to the farm?

05:34.535 --> 05:35.869
- Nurse, can you
please come here?

05:35.903 --> 05:38.906
- Sorry, I'm slammed.
- Oh.

05:38.939 --> 05:42.042
- The farm?
- Uh-huh, you want to come?

05:42.075 --> 05:43.744
- Sure. What's the farm?

05:43.777 --> 05:45.646
- You'll see.

05:47.781 --> 05:49.917
- Please, I need to leave.
- Okay.

05:49.950 --> 05:51.952
- No, I got to go. Can you just
take this tube out of my nose?

05:51.985 --> 05:53.120
- Mr. Jones--
- Everything okay?

05:53.153 --> 05:54.655
- He wants to leave.

05:54.688 --> 05:56.123
- Bowel obstructions,
even partial ones,

05:56.156 --> 05:58.058
can become life-threatening
situations.

05:58.091 --> 05:59.760
We can't discharge you
until it's cleared.

05:59.793 --> 06:01.795
- It doesn't hurt anymore.
- Look, I understand,

06:01.829 --> 06:04.565
but your output
is still too high.

06:04.598 --> 06:05.699
Let's see if I can
feel any--

06:05.733 --> 06:10.170
- No! I just--I don't like
to be touched.

06:10.203 --> 06:12.940
- How we doing in here?

06:16.910 --> 06:18.779
- Give the tube
a little more time.

06:18.812 --> 06:20.881
I promise we'll get you home
as soon as possible.

06:31.759 --> 06:33.761
He was found passed out
on the street.

06:33.794 --> 06:36.697
AB showed a massive stool
in his bowel.

06:36.730 --> 06:39.667
- Wow. Passed out?
- Yeah.

06:39.700 --> 06:42.570
- It must have been pretty bad.
- It's starting to clear,

06:42.603 --> 06:45.105
but he's been combative,
fearful ever since he got here.

06:45.138 --> 06:49.577
- You want a consult?
- Sure. He won't talk to me.

06:49.610 --> 06:50.978
- Oh, look,
there's somebody

06:51.011 --> 06:53.647
he might have
an easier time relating to.

06:56.850 --> 06:58.586
- You call this the vent farm?

06:58.619 --> 07:00.588
- Dark humor keeps you sane

07:00.621 --> 07:01.855
if you're gonna spend
some time here.

07:01.889 --> 07:04.024
Hey, good to see you.

07:04.057 --> 07:05.759
- So this is where
all our comatose patients go?

07:05.793 --> 07:07.194
- Mm-hmm.

07:07.227 --> 07:09.096
A lot of these people
didn't have anyone.

07:09.129 --> 07:10.764
They just got appointed
a case worker

07:10.798 --> 07:13.734
who decided to keep them
on life support.

07:13.767 --> 07:17.738
Others have families
that are still holding out hope.

07:17.771 --> 07:19.072
Either way, they're just--

07:19.106 --> 07:21.174
- Nothing that can
be done, right?

07:21.208 --> 07:22.943
- Nothing medically.

07:22.976 --> 07:25.145
- So what, we're here
to check some culture results?

07:25.178 --> 07:27.715
- Nope.
- Pronounce someone dead?

07:27.748 --> 07:31.785
- Uh-uh.
- So what are we doing?

07:33.787 --> 07:36.123
- We're here to
paint some nails.

07:41.161 --> 07:43.230
- What's going on?

07:43.263 --> 07:45.198
- You remember my cancer
patient, Haley Cline?

07:45.232 --> 07:46.967
Sweet, young girl?
- Yeah.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.903
- This just showed up
in her cultures.

07:49.937 --> 07:53.273
- Oh, God, colistin-resistant
Enterobacter.

07:53.306 --> 07:55.809
- She can barely
fight off infection as it is.

07:55.843 --> 07:58.178
Now she has an
antibiotic-resistant super bug?

07:58.211 --> 08:00.113
This is really bad news.

08:00.147 --> 08:01.815
- Natalie, it's worse
than you think.

08:01.849 --> 08:03.183
- What do you mean?

08:05.953 --> 08:08.789
- This is Eric Tillman,
just came in.

08:08.822 --> 08:10.691
He has CRE too.

08:10.724 --> 08:12.192
- The same bug?
Are you serious?

08:12.225 --> 08:15.863
- Labs just confirmed it.
- [sighs] So we could be

08:15.896 --> 08:17.264
looking at an outbreak

08:17.297 --> 08:19.199
that might not have a cure.

08:24.104 --> 08:24.237
.

08:24.772 --> 08:27.541
[dramatic music]

08:27.575 --> 08:34.615
*

08:36.216 --> 08:39.953
- Dr. Halstead, Dr. Manning,
this is Robin Charles,

08:39.986 --> 08:43.155
the newest member
of our epidemiology department.

08:43.190 --> 08:45.092
- Pleasure.
- Top of her class,

08:45.125 --> 08:47.127
DuPont Scholar,
and she just happens

08:47.160 --> 08:49.162
to be Dr. Charles's
daughter.

08:49.196 --> 08:51.965
- What can I say?
Nepotism is alive and well.

08:51.999 --> 08:54.702
So I hear we've got
colistin-resistant Enterobacter?

08:54.735 --> 08:56.103
- In two patients.
- Did they catch it

08:56.136 --> 08:57.971
in this hospital?
- I don't think so.

08:58.005 --> 08:59.673
There's no record my patient's
ever been here.

08:59.707 --> 09:00.841
- Well, he's here now,
which means

09:00.874 --> 09:04.244
every immunocompromised patient
in this place is at risk.

09:04.277 --> 09:05.813
Do we have final
culture sensitivities yet?

09:05.846 --> 09:08.015
- We're still waiting.
- I'll need to talk to

09:08.048 --> 09:09.683
every one
of your patient's contacts,

09:09.717 --> 09:10.818
get detailed histories,

09:10.851 --> 09:13.253
find out what the connections
between these people are.

09:13.286 --> 09:14.688
I'll be in touch soon.

09:14.722 --> 09:16.189
- Actually, um, wait.

09:16.223 --> 09:19.259
Uh, I think it's my fault.

09:19.292 --> 09:20.728
Haley was here
three days ago.

09:20.761 --> 09:22.062
I missed the diagnosis.

09:22.095 --> 09:23.263
- You don't know that.

09:23.296 --> 09:26.299
She could have just as easily
contracted it after she left.

09:26.333 --> 09:28.836
I saw her records. You treated
her exactly how you should have.

09:28.869 --> 09:31.605
- Well, what if I sent her back
into the city with an infection

09:31.639 --> 09:33.707
and she gave it to Eric
and who knows how many others?

09:33.741 --> 09:36.076
- Natalie, it's a city
of almost 3 million people.

09:36.109 --> 09:37.645
This could all just be
a coincidence.

09:37.678 --> 09:39.847
- Actually, I don't believe
in coincidences.

09:39.880 --> 09:43.684
Sorry.
I'll be in touch.

09:56.363 --> 09:59.599
[beeping]

10:01.802 --> 10:05.272
- Hey, honey.
This is Jeff Clarke,

10:05.305 --> 10:07.307
fourth-year med student,

10:07.340 --> 10:09.743
little rough around the edges,

10:09.777 --> 10:13.647
but it's so hard to find good
help these days. [laughs]

10:15.816 --> 10:18.151
Hi.

10:21.154 --> 10:23.256
[sighs]

10:23.290 --> 10:25.693
- How do you know her?

10:28.295 --> 10:31.431
- She came into the ED late
one night alone,

10:31.464 --> 10:34.768
burst an aneurysm,
massive hemorrhage.

10:34.802 --> 10:38.806
By the time we got her,
we knew it was too late.

10:38.839 --> 10:42.342
She kept on asking me
to talk to her, so I did.

10:42.375 --> 10:46.714
Thing is my mother
had just passed...

10:49.249 --> 10:52.185
And when she used to put me
to sleep as a kid,

10:52.219 --> 10:54.922
she used to call me Maggie-Pie

10:54.955 --> 10:58.091
from a nursery rhyme
about a bird,

10:58.125 --> 11:02.262
and I don't know, maybe Cindy
had heard that rhyme before.

11:02.295 --> 11:05.465
She must have
seen my nametag, I--

11:05.498 --> 11:10.337
'cause in her last moment
she squeezed my hand...

11:11.739 --> 11:13.807
And she called me
Maggie-Pie too.

11:13.841 --> 11:16.810
[light instrumental music]

11:16.844 --> 11:18.846
*

11:18.879 --> 11:22.349
Anyway, CPD looked,
but there was no family,

11:22.382 --> 11:24.417
no friends,
no one to speak for her,

11:24.451 --> 11:28.856
so they brought her here.

11:28.889 --> 11:31.959
Now I check in on her
every week,

11:31.992 --> 11:37.297
tell her what's going on
with my life.

11:37.330 --> 11:40.167
I don't know.

11:40.200 --> 11:43.771
I figure she's got
one foot in this world

11:43.804 --> 11:46.907
and, uh, another in the next
where Mom is.

11:46.940 --> 11:53.981
*

11:54.915 --> 11:57.350
[sighs]

12:02.422 --> 12:04.892
- So why would a 19 year old
have a bowel obstruction?

12:04.925 --> 12:06.894
- Good question.
All his other tests are normal.

12:06.927 --> 12:08.528
- It could be stress, right?
- Could be.

12:08.561 --> 12:11.231
- Stress can present
a hundred different ways.

12:11.264 --> 12:12.800
- But you think
it's something else?

12:12.833 --> 12:15.435
- Don't know. That's what
you're gonna find out.

12:19.807 --> 12:20.707
- Hi.

12:20.740 --> 12:23.243
I'm, uh, Dr. Reese, Sarah.
Can I come in?

12:23.276 --> 12:25.545
- I really want to leave.
- I don't blame you,

12:25.578 --> 12:27.915
but it sounds like you're gonna
be here a little bit longer,

12:27.948 --> 12:30.350
so maybe we could talk?

12:33.253 --> 12:35.288
Or I could just sit here.
Is that okay?

12:35.322 --> 12:37.257
- Why?
- I don't know.

12:37.290 --> 12:39.292
I just thought
you might want some company.

12:51.304 --> 12:55.042
Are you from Chicago?

12:55.075 --> 12:56.543
I've been here five years.

12:56.576 --> 12:58.478
I'm from Connecticut,

12:58.511 --> 13:01.915
and I still totally
dread the winter.

13:01.949 --> 13:04.317
I mean, I thought I knew
what cold was,

13:04.351 --> 13:05.919
but this is, like,

13:05.953 --> 13:08.488
"National Geographic,"
"Frozen Planet" cold.

13:08.521 --> 13:10.357
I carry around
those hand warmer pads

13:10.390 --> 13:13.493
just in case my eyelids
freeze shut.

13:13.526 --> 13:18.065
- I hate the cold.
- Yeah? Where are you from?

13:18.098 --> 13:20.968
- Phoenix.
- Oh, okay.

13:21.001 --> 13:25.873
- I have a sister named Sarah.
- No kidding.

13:25.906 --> 13:27.407
- Uh-huh, yes,
and have Monica

13:27.440 --> 13:29.509
call every patient that's been
to the infusion center

13:29.542 --> 13:31.979
since Monday.

13:32.012 --> 13:34.948
Mm-hmm, yes, anyone with fever,
chills, headaches,

13:34.982 --> 13:38.085
or nausea gets a blood draw.

13:38.118 --> 13:41.288
Yeah, okay.

13:41.321 --> 13:45.492
- How you doing? How's it going?
- You know, busy but good.

13:45.525 --> 13:47.027
- Nice people
in that department, right?

13:47.060 --> 13:49.296
- Yeah, they seem great.
- Yeah.

13:49.329 --> 13:50.998
So you get my text?

13:51.031 --> 13:53.867
When--when we having coffee?
- We will, Dad. I promise.

13:53.901 --> 13:55.535
Just got a lot on my plate,

13:55.568 --> 13:57.404
first couple weeks
of work and all.

13:57.437 --> 13:59.106
- Of course you do.

13:59.139 --> 14:00.573
You're sleeping though, right?
Are you sleeping?

14:00.607 --> 14:04.511
- Dad, come on.
- Hey, new job, new city,

14:04.544 --> 14:05.512
I'm sorry, you know,

14:05.545 --> 14:06.546
could be
a little stressful.

14:06.579 --> 14:09.016
- I'm fine, Dad.

14:09.049 --> 14:11.518
And really,
you're not my therapist.

14:11.551 --> 14:14.421
- Oh.
[blows raspberry]

14:14.454 --> 14:16.056
I'm just--
I'm glad you're here.

14:16.089 --> 14:19.626
- [scoffs]

14:19.659 --> 14:22.062
- Proud of you.

14:24.397 --> 14:27.434
- [stammering weakly]

14:28.668 --> 14:31.438
- Mr. Hall?

14:31.471 --> 14:33.907
Mr. Hall?
We found a tumor

14:33.941 --> 14:36.443
that's compressing
the large vessels in your chest.

14:36.476 --> 14:38.912
We can remove it
with an operation.

14:38.946 --> 14:41.949
- Are you a doctor?
- Yes, I'm Dr. Choi.

14:41.982 --> 14:44.918
I'm your doctor.

14:44.952 --> 14:49.056
- You're Chinese.

14:49.089 --> 14:53.060
I saw the Great Wall.

14:53.093 --> 14:54.995
- Mr. Hall,

14:55.028 --> 14:59.066
I really believe that surgery
is your best option.

14:59.099 --> 15:01.534
Do you give us permission
to perform the surgery?

15:01.568 --> 15:04.104
- Permission?
- Yes.

15:06.573 --> 15:10.643
- Are you a doctor?
- What's going on?

15:10.677 --> 15:12.079
- I'm just explaining
to your father

15:12.112 --> 15:14.081
what's happening in his chest.
- Explaining?

15:14.114 --> 15:15.482
Looks to me like you're trying
to coerce him

15:15.515 --> 15:17.650
into a procedure
he doesn't want.

15:17.684 --> 15:19.086
I'm sorry,
but I'm gonna have to ask

15:19.119 --> 15:22.956
that you not speak
to him alone again.

15:22.990 --> 15:26.926
- I'll check back with you soon.
- Check back?

15:34.567 --> 15:36.469
- Echo to get a better idea
of her cardiac output,

15:36.503 --> 15:37.637
and then we'll take it
from there.

15:37.670 --> 15:39.506
- Dr. Latham, about Mr. Hall,

15:39.539 --> 15:41.975
the three of us need to approach
his son as a united front.

15:42.009 --> 15:43.543
- Why?
- Perhaps together

15:43.576 --> 15:46.179
we can convince him to let us
save his father's life.

15:46.213 --> 15:47.647
- I don't understand.
- Well, I think what

15:47.680 --> 15:48.881
Dr. Choi is suggesting
is that

15:48.915 --> 15:51.418
if we explain the surgery again
in more detail, then maybe--

15:51.451 --> 15:53.453
- Our job isn't to solve
family problems.

15:53.486 --> 15:54.988
Our job is to fix ailments,

15:55.022 --> 15:56.756
and until the Halls ask us
to do that,

15:56.789 --> 16:00.027
there will be no surgery.

16:00.060 --> 16:01.461
This is distracting.

16:01.494 --> 16:04.464
[dramatic music]

16:04.497 --> 16:10.070
*

16:10.103 --> 16:11.238
- Cute shoes.

16:11.271 --> 16:12.772
I could see
my boyfriend in those.

16:12.805 --> 16:15.075
- They're okay, too tight
in the toes.

16:15.108 --> 16:17.410
- [laughs] These are pretty
comfortable,

16:17.444 --> 16:18.545
not the cutest.

16:18.578 --> 16:20.747
I had to order, like,
50 pairs to find the right ones.

16:20.780 --> 16:24.251
- [grunts]
- Are you okay?

16:24.284 --> 16:26.153
- I--I gotta go.
I got to go.

16:26.186 --> 16:27.420
- Hey, it shouldn't be
too much longer,

16:27.454 --> 16:30.157
but let me check
with Dr. Choi.

16:30.190 --> 16:32.192
[retching]

16:32.225 --> 16:34.494
Call Dr. Choi.

16:38.165 --> 16:40.167
Okay, this might
just be from the obstruction.

16:40.200 --> 16:43.470
Is anything hurting?

16:43.503 --> 16:46.206
- He's tachycardic.
- Abdomen's far less distended.

16:46.239 --> 16:49.076
- I--I'm gonna throw up again.

16:49.109 --> 16:52.145
[vomiting, coughing]

16:55.715 --> 16:56.683
- No sign of infection,
no fever.

16:56.716 --> 17:01.121
Hey, has anything
like this happened before?

17:01.154 --> 17:03.190
I am just here to help,
but I need you to tell me

17:03.223 --> 17:06.693
if there's something
I should know.

17:06.726 --> 17:12.098
Danny, I am on your side.

17:12.132 --> 17:15.768
- Heroin. Heroin.
- What?

17:15.801 --> 17:19.106
Are you--are you on heroin?

17:19.138 --> 17:21.108
He is in withdrawal.
Give me 10 milligrams IM

17:21.141 --> 17:21.907
of methadone
and one of Ativan.

17:21.941 --> 17:25.712
- Got it.
- Hey, I am right here.

17:25.744 --> 17:27.547
It is going to be okay.

17:27.579 --> 17:29.782
*

17:33.386 --> 17:36.389
- You know, I couldn't stop
thinking about Cindy.

17:36.423 --> 17:39.792
No family, alone in that room
month after month.

17:39.826 --> 17:42.195
- Yeah.
- So I called a friend of mine

17:42.229 --> 17:44.164
in the state Bureau
of Identification

17:44.197 --> 17:46.233
to look into it.

17:46.266 --> 17:48.535
It turns out that Cindy
has a sister in Spokane.

17:48.568 --> 17:50.303
- Really?
- Yeah.

17:50.337 --> 17:51.471
Gave her the number
to the hospital. I don't know.

17:51.504 --> 17:54.541
Maybe this means Cindy'll
have another person in her life.

17:54.574 --> 17:56.876
- That'd be great.
- It would, right?

17:56.909 --> 17:58.245
- Yes, of course.

18:02.582 --> 18:06.519
[beeping]
[grunting, wailing]

18:08.221 --> 18:09.856
- O2 stats are dropping.
- Arms are swelling.

18:09.889 --> 18:11.458
He must be hemorrhaging
into the tumor.

18:11.491 --> 18:12.792
It's compressing his SVC.

18:12.825 --> 18:15.862
- [wailing, stammering]

18:19.866 --> 18:22.869
[muffled]
Save me.

18:22.902 --> 18:26.506
- He said, "Save me."
- [groaning]

18:26.539 --> 18:28.875
- What's going on?
- He said, "Save me."

18:28.908 --> 18:31.778
- Where's his son?
- I don't know, but I heard him.

18:31.811 --> 18:33.213
Let's bag him.

18:33.246 --> 18:36.583
- [wailing]
- Let's go.

18:36.616 --> 18:39.519
- Sat's still dropping.
- Okay, let's get him to the OR.

18:39.552 --> 18:41.254
- What are you doing?
- The patient expressed

18:41.288 --> 18:42.555
his wishes,
we're taking him to surgery.

18:42.589 --> 18:43.890
- Are you kidding?
He's demented.

18:43.923 --> 18:45.858
He can't express his wishes.
- I heard him.

18:45.892 --> 18:48.461
- Doctor, ready to go.
- Okay, let's move.

18:48.495 --> 18:51.264
- You can't do this.

18:59.439 --> 19:02.442
- How is it having
her back in town?

19:02.475 --> 19:04.377
- Oh, it's great.

19:04.411 --> 19:05.912
It's great.
- Yeah.

19:05.945 --> 19:07.247
- Yeah, haven't shared
a zip code

19:07.280 --> 19:09.382
since she was
in high school.

19:09.416 --> 19:11.384
- You been spending
some time together?

19:11.418 --> 19:14.821
- Yeah. I mean,
haven't really hung out yet.

19:14.854 --> 19:16.189
You know, she's got
a lot on her plate,

19:16.223 --> 19:18.391
It's like, new job,
new apartment.

19:18.425 --> 19:20.393
I mean, just getting cable
installed, like, come on.

19:20.427 --> 19:21.461
That's a bitch.

19:21.494 --> 19:25.265
- So after she's got cable?
- Yeah.

19:25.298 --> 19:26.599
- Daniel.
- Sharon, look,

19:26.633 --> 19:27.834
she's never gonna forgive me.

19:27.867 --> 19:31.938
- For divorcing her mother?
- Yeah, that and I don't know,

19:31.971 --> 19:34.474
all the time I was there,
wasn't really there, you know?

19:34.507 --> 19:35.575
You remember.

19:35.608 --> 19:37.310
- Yeah, I remember,
but I'm sure she--

19:37.344 --> 19:38.311
- Dr. Charles?
- Oh, yes?

19:38.345 --> 19:39.346
- I am sorry. Are you available?

19:39.379 --> 19:42.482
- Could you excuse me?
I'm sorry.

19:42.515 --> 19:43.950
- You were right. There is
something going on with Danny.

19:43.983 --> 19:45.952
- Oh.
Tell me.

19:45.985 --> 19:47.954
- He told me
he's addicted to heroin.

19:47.987 --> 19:49.956
He started going through
withdrawal, he's stable now,

19:49.989 --> 19:51.358
on methadone and Ativan,

19:51.391 --> 19:53.360
and I--I know
detox is a long road,

19:53.393 --> 19:56.963
but maybe we can help.

19:56.996 --> 19:57.964
- Could work.

19:57.997 --> 20:00.233
Let's see what we got.
- Okay.

20:01.334 --> 20:03.636
- Hi.
- Hi, uh, I'm Dr. Reese.

20:03.670 --> 20:05.572
- And I'm Dr. Charles.
It's nice to meet you.

20:05.605 --> 20:07.574
- I'm Tina, Danny's mother.

20:07.607 --> 20:10.477
He just told me what's going on.
I had no idea.

20:10.510 --> 20:13.413
- Well, it's a lot
to take in.

20:13.446 --> 20:14.581
How you feeling, Danny?

20:14.614 --> 20:17.684
- He's embarrassed,
and he should be.

20:17.717 --> 20:19.852
It's just so confusing
why he would do this.

20:19.886 --> 20:22.355
We've tried so hard
to be good parents.

20:22.389 --> 20:25.892
- Well, fortunately,
Dr. Reese has a good plan

20:25.925 --> 20:29.962
about how to move forward.
- Please tell me what to do.

20:29.996 --> 20:32.965
- So as long as you continue
to tolerate the methadone,

20:32.999 --> 20:34.267
I'm gonna switch you
to orals.

20:34.301 --> 20:38.605
Then we can talk about rehab,
but first, how are you feeling?

20:38.638 --> 20:42.609
- I appreciate all this,
but I know he wants to go home.

20:42.642 --> 20:43.610
- That's totally understandable,

20:43.643 --> 20:45.712
but Danny is gonna have
to finish his IV first,

20:45.745 --> 20:47.314
and that's gonna take
a couple of hours,

20:47.347 --> 20:49.616
so might want to go get
a cup of coffee or--

20:49.649 --> 20:51.384
he is still gonna
be here for a while.

20:51.418 --> 20:53.653
- Right now I don't think Danny
wants me to leave his side,

20:53.686 --> 20:56.389
do you, honey?

20:58.325 --> 21:00.593
- Okay, makes perfect sense.

21:00.627 --> 21:03.563
Um, why don't we check back
on you in a bit?

21:10.703 --> 21:13.506
- I don't know what happened.
He's totally different.

21:13.540 --> 21:15.908
- Well, it's gonna be a little
tense with Mom in there, right?

21:15.942 --> 21:17.477
- But it's like
a switch was flipped.

21:17.510 --> 21:19.379
He wouldn't even look me
in the eye.

21:19.412 --> 21:21.648
- Something is a little off.

21:21.681 --> 21:24.684
What--how long
till he's discharged?

21:24.717 --> 21:25.685
- Well, his obstruction's
cleared,

21:25.718 --> 21:27.720
and now that we know
it was caused by the heroin,

21:27.754 --> 21:31.458
there's no reason to keep him
once his IV's done.

21:31.491 --> 21:34.527
- Let's ask Dr. Choi
to order a lactic level

21:34.561 --> 21:37.664
and an iron panel.
- Why would we want those?

21:37.697 --> 21:39.666
- Buy us a little time.

21:39.699 --> 21:43.069
We got to separate them, see if
we can find out what's what.

21:43.102 --> 21:45.338
- Hmm.

21:47.640 --> 21:49.609
- This was the right
thing to do.

21:49.642 --> 21:52.412
- Hmm?
- The surgery.

21:52.445 --> 21:55.081
- Absolutely. Why?
- Well, you seemed against it.

21:55.114 --> 21:57.450
- The son said no,
so it was a no.

21:57.484 --> 21:59.952
The patient said yes,
so now it's a yes.

21:59.986 --> 22:01.454
Is there more to it
than that?

22:04.557 --> 22:07.494
- Guess not.
- I'm not good with ambiguity,

22:07.527 --> 22:10.963
Dr. Rhodes.

22:10.997 --> 22:12.999
I want you to watch
how I elevate the caudal portion

22:13.032 --> 22:14.501
of the right inferior horn

22:14.534 --> 22:16.803
while still attached
to the pericardial fat pad.

22:16.836 --> 22:20.507
It's an easier method to divide
and ligate it like that.

22:28.014 --> 22:30.983
- Mr. and Mrs. Cline?

22:31.017 --> 22:33.119
I have some news.

22:33.152 --> 22:35.154
The lab tested Haley's
CRE culture

22:35.187 --> 22:36.656
against every antibiotic,

22:36.689 --> 22:39.726
and it turns out
it's sensitive to just one,

22:39.759 --> 22:42.595
a drug called
ceftazidime/avibactam.

22:42.629 --> 22:44.063
- [chuckles]

22:44.096 --> 22:46.399
So there's a cure?
That's fantastic.

22:46.433 --> 22:49.402
- Yes, but the thing is

22:49.436 --> 22:51.738
the bug is sensitive
at a very low rate,

22:51.771 --> 22:56.476
which means it works best for
patients that we catch early.

22:56.509 --> 22:59.546
- So, um--so Haley?
- We won't know anything

22:59.579 --> 23:01.481
until we try the medication.

23:01.514 --> 23:02.749
- I waited too long, didn't I?
- No.

23:02.782 --> 23:04.050
- No, I should have
brought her in sooner.

23:04.083 --> 23:05.051
- No.
- Mrs. Cline--

23:05.084 --> 23:06.118
- I am usually so on top
of this,

23:06.152 --> 23:09.522
but I just--I can't tell
what's an emergency anymore.

23:09.556 --> 23:10.757
She's always so sick.

23:10.790 --> 23:12.759
- You cannot blame yourself.

23:12.792 --> 23:16.529
Please, this is not
your fault.

23:16.563 --> 23:21.468
I promise you, we are gonna do
everything we can to help her.

23:21.501 --> 23:24.103
- Okay.
Thank--thank you.

23:24.136 --> 23:31.177
*

23:42.655 --> 23:44.156
- How is he?
- They're just getting

23:44.190 --> 23:47.660
in the chest.

23:47.694 --> 23:50.663
When he was crashing,
did you hear what he said?

23:50.697 --> 23:53.199
- No.

24:00.172 --> 24:02.609
We're here to save lives.

24:02.642 --> 24:04.711
You're doing what you're
supposed to do.

24:08.147 --> 24:10.483
- Yeah.

24:10.517 --> 24:11.818
- [moaning]
[alarm beeping]

24:11.851 --> 24:14.821
- Someone help!

24:14.854 --> 24:16.523
- She can't get a breath.
I need to intubate.

24:16.556 --> 24:17.824
- Ma'am, please move.
- Five of versed.

24:17.857 --> 24:20.259
- What's going on?
- She could be in septic shock.

24:20.292 --> 24:22.595
- I don't know. Pressure's fine.
Pulse is strong.

24:22.629 --> 24:25.264
- Okay.
- [moaning]

24:25.297 --> 24:26.533
- What's going on?

24:26.566 --> 24:27.700
- Please, come with me.
- Well--

24:27.734 --> 24:28.701
- It's okay.

24:28.735 --> 24:29.836
- I can't get the tube in.

24:29.869 --> 24:30.937
It's like something's
blocking it.

24:30.970 --> 24:33.139
- Do she eat anything?
- No.

24:33.172 --> 24:35.141
- Damn it.
- Sat's down to 50.

24:35.174 --> 24:38.578
- Doris, give me the ultrasound.
- Got it.

24:38.611 --> 24:39.646
- I need a CricKit.

24:39.679 --> 24:41.213
- What?
- I need to make a hole

24:41.247 --> 24:42.782
in her trachea
so she can breathe.

24:42.815 --> 24:44.250
- Oh, my God.

24:44.283 --> 24:47.486
- [moaning]

24:49.188 --> 24:50.523
- Wait, you're right.

24:50.557 --> 24:52.124
Her airway is blocked.

24:52.158 --> 24:53.560
- It's an abscess.

24:53.593 --> 24:54.861
The infection's spread
to her pharynx.

24:54.894 --> 24:56.729
I'll page ENT.
- No, no time.

24:56.763 --> 24:58.164
Give me a minor tray
and a knife.

24:58.197 --> 24:59.932
- I got it.
- It's okay, I can do it.

24:59.966 --> 25:03.670
- No, I got this.
- Sat's down to 50.

25:08.307 --> 25:10.610
- Hold her arm, please.

25:15.948 --> 25:18.985
[alarm beeping]

25:21.721 --> 25:22.689
- Nat, I have to Cric her.

25:22.722 --> 25:24.223
- Hang on.

25:29.762 --> 25:30.730
- Nat.
- I got it.

25:30.763 --> 25:31.731
- Hey, doesn't hurt that much.

25:31.764 --> 25:32.765
- Don't do it like this.
- Okay.

25:32.799 --> 25:34.701
[squishing]

25:34.734 --> 25:37.269
- [sighs]
- Oh, my God.

25:40.873 --> 25:43.710
- Dr. Manning,
thank you so much.

25:44.677 --> 25:46.713
- Lungs clear.

25:50.750 --> 25:51.884
- Baby.

25:51.918 --> 25:58.958
*

26:06.132 --> 26:09.035
- How's she doing?
- She's stable for now,

26:09.068 --> 26:11.337
but the abscess
was caused by her infection.

26:11.370 --> 26:13.640
It's only a matter of time
before she gets more.

26:13.673 --> 26:15.374
What's going on from your end?

26:15.407 --> 26:17.877
- Bad news, I'm afraid.

26:17.910 --> 26:21.648
East Mercy just got
a new CRE patient, intubated,

26:21.681 --> 26:24.617
can't get any info yet,
but we're working on it.

26:24.651 --> 26:26.919
- And they're sure it's CRE?

26:26.953 --> 26:28.054
That's three.

26:28.087 --> 26:29.756
It's a pattern,
not a coincidence.

26:29.789 --> 26:31.758
- Okay, but just because
another person has it

26:31.791 --> 26:32.859
doesn't mean it's your fault.

26:32.892 --> 26:34.827
- Well, there's only one way
to find out.

26:34.861 --> 26:36.929
We need to extubate Eric.

26:36.963 --> 26:40.667
- No. It's too dangerous.
- We've tried everything else,

26:40.700 --> 26:42.635
his social media, his contacts.

26:42.669 --> 26:44.070
In order to find the source
of the infection,

26:44.103 --> 26:46.138
we have to figure out
how he is connected to Haley

26:46.172 --> 26:47.740
and this patient
at East Mercy.

26:47.774 --> 26:49.175
We need to talk to him.

26:49.208 --> 26:50.977
- Well, that's
if you can extubate him.

26:51.010 --> 26:52.178
He may not even tolerate it.

26:52.211 --> 26:55.181
- We will go as slowly
and safely as possible.

26:55.214 --> 26:56.683
- That's not a decision
you can make.

26:56.716 --> 26:58.417
- No, it's not, but he can.

26:58.450 --> 27:02.722
*

27:02.755 --> 27:04.156
- Okay.

27:04.190 --> 27:05.658
I'll turn down his propofol,

27:05.692 --> 27:08.194
and he should be awake
in a few minutes.

27:08.227 --> 27:11.864
- [humming softly]

27:15.034 --> 27:18.805
Make sure you separate out
the recurrent laryngeal nerve.

27:18.838 --> 27:20.139
- Copy that. Do you see it?

27:20.172 --> 27:23.109
- Should be right--ah, here.

27:23.142 --> 27:25.845
[continues humming]

27:25.878 --> 27:28.180
Ah, pull harder.

27:28.214 --> 27:32.919
You see "The Force Awakens"?
- Got it--uh--

27:32.952 --> 27:34.887
I'm sorry,
did I--did I see what?

27:34.921 --> 27:36.989
- "The Force Awakens."

27:37.023 --> 27:40.993
- Uh...no.
- When Rey defeats Kylo Ren,

27:41.027 --> 27:43.863
the glove falls off
of his left hand,

27:43.896 --> 27:46.198
but when he sits up,
it's on again.

27:46.232 --> 27:47.734
These are
professional filmmakers.

27:47.767 --> 27:49.401
It's unbelievable to me.
[chuckles]

27:49.435 --> 27:53.706
[continues humming]

27:53.740 --> 27:56.408
- O2's in the high 80s.
That's the best we can get.

27:56.442 --> 27:58.444
- Okay.

27:58.477 --> 28:01.047
Eric, I'm Dr. Manning.

28:01.080 --> 28:04.416
You are in the hospital right
now with a very bad infection,

28:04.450 --> 28:06.152
and we're concerned
that other people might be

28:06.185 --> 28:07.920
getting this infection
as well.

28:07.954 --> 28:09.956
A lot of people.

28:09.989 --> 28:13.059
If we don't find them soon,
it may be too late,

28:13.092 --> 28:14.827
but in order to do
that we're gonna need

28:14.861 --> 28:16.428
to ask you some questions.

28:16.462 --> 28:18.765
- The problem is if we take
your tube out,

28:18.798 --> 28:21.433
we cannot guarantee you'll
be able to breathe on your own.

28:21.467 --> 28:25.037
- And once it's out, we may not
be able to put it back in.

28:30.943 --> 28:34.180
What we are asking you
to do won't help you directly,

28:34.213 --> 28:38.017
but it could save
a lot of lives.

28:38.050 --> 28:41.487
You don't have to do this.

28:41.520 --> 28:45.925
Do you give us permission
to take out your breathing tube?

28:45.958 --> 28:48.928
[dramatic music]

28:48.961 --> 28:54.033
*

28:54.066 --> 28:57.269
Thank you.

28:57.303 --> 28:58.771
Okay.

28:58.805 --> 28:59.972
- Okay.

29:00.006 --> 29:07.046
*

29:17.256 --> 29:20.159
[alarms beeping]
- [inhaling sharply]

29:20.192 --> 29:23.863
[gurgling]
[coughing]

29:27.867 --> 29:30.269
[deeply inhales, exhales]

29:43.883 --> 29:48.287
- He's still in the high 80s.

29:48.320 --> 29:50.556
- How are you feeling?
Are you okay?

29:50.589 --> 29:54.894
- [softly] Yeah.
- Yeah? Okay, okay, good.

29:54.927 --> 29:58.564
Okay, now, Eric, we're gonna
ask you some questions.

29:58.597 --> 30:00.032
- [softly] Okay.

30:03.135 --> 30:05.104
- Danny, I thought
we could spend some time

30:05.137 --> 30:06.572
looking over
a few rehab centers.

30:06.605 --> 30:08.941
- Thank you,
but I made some calls.

30:08.975 --> 30:10.242
We're already booked
in a private facility

30:10.276 --> 30:11.911
for as soon as
he's discharged,

30:11.944 --> 30:14.080
which should be
any minute, right?

30:16.048 --> 30:20.586
- Are you sure you're
feeling well enough to leave?

30:20.619 --> 30:23.923
Uh, well, if you
ever want to talk.

30:23.956 --> 30:26.058
- Thank you.

30:32.965 --> 30:36.068
- [coughing]

30:36.102 --> 30:38.905
- Danny, are you okay?

30:38.938 --> 30:40.940
- Yeah.
- We should get going.

30:48.047 --> 30:51.383
- Uh--because bowel obstructions
can lead to irritation

30:51.417 --> 30:53.119
in the diaphragm
if they aren't fully resolved,

30:53.152 --> 30:56.188
I--I feel like I should keep you
for some more observation.

30:56.222 --> 30:58.190
- You know, if it gets worse,
we'll have it checked at rehab.

30:58.224 --> 30:59.325
There are doctors there.

30:59.358 --> 31:01.593
- [coughing]

31:01.627 --> 31:04.931
- We should do a chest X-ray.

31:04.964 --> 31:08.067
Yes, yes, we need
a stat chest X-ray.

31:08.100 --> 31:09.335
Could you take Danny
over to radiology?

31:09.368 --> 31:10.336
- I'll get a wheelchair.

31:10.369 --> 31:11.670
- Really,
I'm sure he'll be fine.

31:11.703 --> 31:12.871
We're on a schedule.

31:12.905 --> 31:15.007
- Mrs. Jones, I see how
concerned you are for your son,

31:15.041 --> 31:16.943
and I want to make sure
he gets the best care.

31:16.976 --> 31:18.978
I promise we're gonna
make this quick.

31:21.647 --> 31:23.415
- So it turns out
Eric's roommate

31:23.449 --> 31:26.452
was seen here up in GI
three days ago for a bleed.

31:26.485 --> 31:29.121
- But Eric wasn't here with him?
- No, but he's immunocompromised

31:29.155 --> 31:30.957
from rheumatoid arthritis meds,

31:30.990 --> 31:34.093
which means even if his roommate
was just a carrier for CRE,

31:34.126 --> 31:36.095
Eric could easily
catch it from him.

31:36.128 --> 31:37.663
- And the patient in the ED
at East Mercy?

31:37.696 --> 31:38.664
- Was upstairs Monday

31:38.697 --> 31:41.200
to see his hematologist
for chronic anemia.

31:41.233 --> 31:43.635
- So with Haley,
that's three patients

31:43.669 --> 31:45.137
all within the last few days.

31:45.171 --> 31:47.073
- We're checking the hospital
records line by line

31:47.106 --> 31:48.240
to see if they have
anything in common,

31:48.274 --> 31:51.677
staff, location,
food, supplies.

31:51.710 --> 31:53.012
Think we're almost there.

32:06.258 --> 32:09.328
- Maggie?
- Hey, what's going on?

32:09.361 --> 32:12.064
- The hospital just received
a set of legal papers.

32:12.098 --> 32:14.033
They're from Cindy's sister.

32:14.066 --> 32:15.201
- Oh.
- She got in touch?

32:15.234 --> 32:17.203
- I'm afraid so.

32:17.236 --> 32:19.405
She's ordering us
to withdraw support.

32:19.438 --> 32:20.739
- What? No.

32:20.772 --> 32:22.474
- I've already spoken to legal.

32:22.508 --> 32:24.210
There's nothing we can do.

32:24.243 --> 32:27.246
I am truly, truly sorry.

32:27.279 --> 32:29.015
- [sighs]
- Maggie, I had no idea--

32:46.065 --> 32:46.865
- You feeling a little
better, sweetheart?

32:50.036 --> 32:50.869
Well, it's still early,

32:50.902 --> 32:52.571
but it looks like
her fever's breaking.

32:52.604 --> 32:57.076
I think the antibiotics
may be starting to work.

32:57.109 --> 32:58.610
I'll be back in a bit
to check in again.

32:58.644 --> 33:00.179
- Thank you, Doctor.

33:04.350 --> 33:07.186
- I think Haley's
turning the corner.

33:07.219 --> 33:10.289
- Yeah, Eric's perking up
a little bit too.

33:14.260 --> 33:17.129
Extubating him was risky.

33:17.163 --> 33:19.331
But it was a good call.

33:21.167 --> 33:22.734
- I found our link.

33:24.270 --> 33:25.371
- An endoscope?

33:25.404 --> 33:27.273
- Haley, Eric's roommate,

33:27.306 --> 33:28.807
the patient at East Mercy

33:28.840 --> 33:31.710
all had endoscopies here
in the last week.

33:31.743 --> 33:34.180
- Okay, but we're always gowned
and gloved,

33:34.213 --> 33:36.082
and everything
gets sterilized.

33:36.115 --> 33:37.616
- So this crevice along the tip

33:37.649 --> 33:39.618
is just wide enough
to harbor bacteria

33:39.651 --> 33:41.820
and small enough that even
following the manufacturer's

33:41.853 --> 33:44.123
guidelines, it doesn't always
clean that groove.

33:44.156 --> 33:46.225
- Well, we have to tell the FDA.
- They know.

33:46.258 --> 33:47.726
They're the ones that told us.

33:47.759 --> 33:48.794
- Wait.
- What?

33:48.827 --> 33:51.630
- The FDA knows?
- Yes.

33:51.663 --> 33:52.731
- Our hospital
has dozens of these.

33:52.764 --> 33:55.067
There must be thousands in use
across the country.

33:55.101 --> 33:57.269
- That's why the FDA
hasn't pulled them.

33:57.303 --> 33:59.738
They don't want to cause
an endoscope shortage.

33:59.771 --> 34:02.608
- So the agency created
to protect patients is--

34:02.641 --> 34:05.311
- Made a cost-benefit analysis.

34:05.344 --> 34:06.745
- I have to
tell Haley's parents.

34:06.778 --> 34:09.281
- No, no, no, that's my job.

34:09.315 --> 34:11.750
Thank you, all.

34:11.783 --> 34:13.351
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

34:13.385 --> 34:17.322
*

34:17.356 --> 34:18.357
They knew about it.

34:18.389 --> 34:21.860
- Unbelievable.
- It really is.

34:21.893 --> 34:26.165
But I was right about one thing.
Told you it wasn't your fault.

34:26.197 --> 34:29.235
- [chuckles]
It's great, what you two have.

34:29.268 --> 34:30.335
- I'm sorry?

34:30.369 --> 34:33.239
- You and Dr. Halstead,
you're really good together.

34:33.272 --> 34:38.710
*

34:38.744 --> 34:41.880
- Straight edges, opaque.
It looks manmade,

34:41.913 --> 34:43.748
like there was something
under Danny on the table.

34:43.782 --> 34:45.784
- No, this is definitely
inside of him.

34:45.817 --> 34:48.320
I could be wrong, but I think
this might be a tracking device.

34:48.353 --> 34:51.456
- A what?
- A transponder.

34:51.489 --> 34:53.125
Emits a homing signal.
Would explain

34:53.159 --> 34:54.760
how that woman found him.

34:54.793 --> 34:57.763
- You mean his mom?
- Yeah, is she, though?

34:57.796 --> 35:00.466
I mean, think about it--
the guarded behavior,

35:00.499 --> 35:02.368
heroin abuse.

35:02.401 --> 35:04.403
- Wait, you think
he's a drug mule?

35:04.436 --> 35:06.372
- Resistance to examination
by male doctors

35:06.405 --> 35:09.508
suggesting a history of abuse
by other men.

35:09.541 --> 35:12.511
I've seen this before.

35:12.544 --> 35:15.414
I think that Danny might be
a victim of sex trafficking.

35:15.447 --> 35:20.152
- Sex trafficking?

35:20.186 --> 35:23.922
So that woman...
- Is his pimp.

35:23.955 --> 35:25.324
[dramatic music]

35:25.357 --> 35:27.159
Wait, Sarah.

35:27.193 --> 35:29.328
Dr. Reese? Stop.

35:29.361 --> 35:30.396
- We can't just
let her take him.

35:30.429 --> 35:31.663
- He is not a minor,

35:31.697 --> 35:34.833
so we have no right to intercede
unless he explicitly asks us to.

35:34.866 --> 35:37.336
- But he wanted me
to find the chip.

35:37.369 --> 35:38.337
He wanted me to know.

35:38.370 --> 35:40.806
- Well, what did he say?
What exactly did he say?

35:40.839 --> 35:43.275
- He didn't say anything,
but he was--

35:43.309 --> 35:44.710
- See, Sarah, it's not enough.

35:44.743 --> 35:46.278
Crazy as it sounds,
we need to know

35:46.312 --> 35:48.714
that he's psychologically ready
to be extricated.

35:48.747 --> 35:50.316
We do this the wrong way,
we call the police,

35:50.349 --> 35:52.918
could be very, very bad for him.

35:52.951 --> 35:55.454
It's why we need to hear it
from his own lips. Trust me.

35:55.487 --> 35:57.756
- Then I need to talk to him.
- [sighs]

35:57.789 --> 36:04.363
*

36:04.396 --> 36:06.432
- Danny?

36:12.371 --> 36:13.805
- Thanks for all your help.

36:13.839 --> 36:18.277
*

36:18.310 --> 36:20.812
[engine turns over]

36:20.846 --> 36:27.886
*

36:29.788 --> 36:30.956
- What's gonna happen to him?

36:30.989 --> 36:37.929
*

36:39.298 --> 36:41.233
- Hey.

36:41.267 --> 36:42.868
- Hi.

36:42.901 --> 36:45.271
- Fellowship programs?

36:45.304 --> 36:49.007
- Yeah, I'm just wondering if
staying here was a mistake.

36:49.040 --> 36:51.009
- Why?

36:51.042 --> 36:54.546
- Latham--the man is odd.

36:54.580 --> 36:56.782
He says that he
is not good with ambiguity.

36:56.815 --> 36:58.517
That is an understatement.

36:58.550 --> 36:59.985
He is from Mars.

37:00.018 --> 37:01.987
I--I am constantly
trying to figure out

37:02.020 --> 37:03.522
who the hell is this guy,

37:03.555 --> 37:05.257
and I don't know
if I can handle working

37:05.291 --> 37:07.993
with him every day
for the next two years.

37:08.026 --> 37:11.397
- Is he? I get why
you'd feel that way.

37:11.430 --> 37:14.466
I just think he takes
some getting used to.

37:14.500 --> 37:16.468
- Did you just say, "Is he?"
- Why don't you come meet us

37:16.502 --> 37:18.637
on the balcony tonight
around 7:00?

37:18.670 --> 37:20.606
- [chuckles]
Why should I do that?

37:20.639 --> 37:24.343
- Because I think there's more
to him than meets the eye.

37:25.644 --> 37:27.846
- [laughs] Okay.

37:30.882 --> 37:32.384
[knocking]

37:32.418 --> 37:33.485
- Mr. Hall.

37:37.456 --> 37:40.359
You're awake.

37:40.392 --> 37:42.528
- You a doctor?

37:42.561 --> 37:44.330
- Yes.

37:44.363 --> 37:45.564
We were worried about you.

37:49.601 --> 37:50.902
- That girl.

37:55.374 --> 37:56.608
- Laurie?

37:56.642 --> 37:58.444
- [clears throat]
Laurie.

37:58.477 --> 38:00.412
- You should know,
through all of this,

38:00.446 --> 38:02.414
she was your strongest advocate.

38:02.448 --> 38:03.882
- I'm sure.
[chuckles]

38:03.915 --> 38:06.518
- Sir?

38:06.552 --> 38:09.621
- I'm her--what's that word?

38:12.691 --> 38:16.061
Gravy train--
is that the word?

38:19.965 --> 38:21.533
- Okay.

38:26.672 --> 38:28.674
- You can't take it with you.

38:29.941 --> 38:32.611
[laughs, coughs]

38:41.753 --> 38:44.923
- How's he doing?
- Surprisingly well.

38:46.392 --> 38:48.727
- You made the right decision,
Dr. Choi.

38:48.760 --> 38:51.430
- Did I?

38:51.463 --> 38:53.465
I don't know.

38:53.499 --> 38:54.666
It could have gone either way.

38:57.603 --> 39:00.372
Combat medicine
was always so simple.

39:00.406 --> 39:03.409
Just save whoever they put
in front of you;

39:03.442 --> 39:05.076
never any questions,
"Should I?

39:05.110 --> 39:06.545
Shouldn't I?"

39:08.079 --> 39:10.449
Never really had to deal
with that before.

39:10.482 --> 39:16.755
*

39:16.788 --> 39:19.958
[beeping,
breathing machine pumping]

39:21.593 --> 39:23.662
- Tell Mom I said hi.

39:23.695 --> 39:30.736

39:36.642 --> 39:37.609
[sighs]

39:37.643 --> 39:44.683
