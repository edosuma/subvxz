03:16.736 --> 03:18.438
The U.S.
Marshals assigned

03:18.472 --> 03:20.441
to the Indian Territories

03:20.473 --> 03:23.543
spent months away
from their families.

03:23.576 --> 03:28.216
Frontier life often took
a toll on young mothers.

03:28.248 --> 03:31.384
After two years raising
their five children alone,

03:31.418 --> 03:33.754
Isabel Gray was no exception.

03:38.324 --> 03:39.860
Marshal Henry Thomas,

03:39.894 --> 03:42.330
known only by his nickname Heck,

03:42.362 --> 03:44.865
chose not to chase after them.

03:44.899 --> 03:48.902
Isabel shed no tears,
and Heck only a few

03:48.936 --> 03:51.806
for the children he
would never see again.

03:51.838 --> 03:56.210
Though his parents desired him
to become a Baptist preacher,

03:56.242 --> 03:59.780
the residue of which would
haunt him in years to come,

03:59.812 --> 04:04.618
Heck's talents shifted less
paternal and less godly.

04:04.651 --> 04:07.487
Despite his focus and his faith,

04:07.520 --> 04:09.524
his depression was deep.

04:09.556 --> 04:11.825
He chose neither the
bottle nor the madams

04:11.859 --> 04:13.528
who would pursue him.

04:13.561 --> 04:16.297
Instead of succumb
to the melancholy,

04:16.329 --> 04:20.233
Marshal Thomas committed
himself to his work.

07:11.971 --> 07:12.839
Whoa!

09:23.236 --> 09:26.105
Heck Thomas
split the $1,400 reward

09:26.139 --> 09:28.975
with his six
compatriots that day.

09:29.976 --> 09:31.544
After the countless bounties

09:31.577 --> 09:33.813
he'd accumulated
through the years,

09:33.846 --> 09:35.982
it was neither the
money nor the articles

09:36.015 --> 09:39.252
written about him
that he was after.

09:39.285 --> 09:42.255
With his death, Bill
Doolin provided the Marshal

09:42.288 --> 09:45.759
the beautiful finale
to his life's opus.

10:08.782 --> 10:09.850
Papa?

11:08.274 --> 11:09.143
Dalton!

11:10.110 --> 11:11.111
Come on out!

11:12.046 --> 11:15.081
We know the girls
are in there with ya.

11:15.115 --> 11:17.084
Nobody has to get hurt.

11:18.818 --> 11:19.687
Dalton!

11:20.821 --> 11:23.023
It's your last chance.

12:40.933 --> 12:44.038
How many more times
I gotta kill you?

13:36.322 --> 13:39.058
Bill Dalton, leader
of the Wild Bunch.

13:39.091 --> 13:41.928
First cousin of the
Younger-Jesse James gang.

13:41.961 --> 13:44.497
Last outlaw brother
of the Dalton Gang.

13:44.530 --> 13:47.000
Most wanted criminal in America,

13:47.033 --> 13:49.370
killed right here in Ardmore!

13:54.006 --> 13:55.308
Paula's funeral home

13:55.341 --> 13:58.077
barely contained the circus.

13:58.110 --> 14:00.413
Patrons shoved in
for the final glimpse

14:00.447 --> 14:04.317
of the prairie's most
infamous outlaw kingpin.

14:05.217 --> 14:07.253
Long after expiration,

14:07.287 --> 14:10.490
Bill Dalton's celebrity
would survive.

14:10.524 --> 14:14.427
The newspapers would
circulate coast to coast.

14:14.461 --> 14:18.199
His artifacts would
become collectors items.

14:19.298 --> 14:22.903
The dime novels would
sell for decades.

14:22.936 --> 14:27.942
Within years, the lines between
legend and history blurred.

14:28.841 --> 14:30.309
With each breath of his name,

14:30.342 --> 14:33.413
the authentic ghost
of the man would dim

14:33.446 --> 14:37.283
one shade at a time
into nothingness.

14:37.317 --> 14:39.052
The myth celebrating his crimes

14:39.085 --> 14:42.823
often diminished
his violent nature.

14:42.855 --> 14:45.192
The lore behind his robberies

14:45.225 --> 14:48.262
often misplaced his
gang's tenacious joy

14:48.294 --> 14:49.929
for killing lawmen.

14:51.398 --> 14:55.402
Those who knew him
best would lament that

14:55.434 --> 14:58.004
neither brutality nor
leadership was germane

14:58.038 --> 14:59.507
to his personality.

15:00.974 --> 15:03.310
Those who knew him
longest would lament that

15:03.342 --> 15:06.379
he never wanted
this life at all.

15:06.413 --> 15:08.115
That they missed
his soft demeanor

15:08.148 --> 15:10.283
and clever sense of humor.

15:11.451 --> 15:14.388
Those that loved him
most would lament that

15:14.421 --> 15:17.424
he preferred the background
and supporting roles

15:17.456 --> 15:20.927
to the leading one
he played at the end.

15:22.261 --> 15:26.032
In truth, the heralded
"King of Western Outlaws"

15:26.066 --> 15:28.802
was not born to a throne at all.

15:30.403 --> 15:33.907
The genesis of Bill Dalton's
royal outlaw lineage

15:33.940 --> 15:37.278
began quietly only a
couple years before.

15:58.932 --> 15:59.600
Really?

16:01.467 --> 16:02.535
It'll work.

16:03.769 --> 16:06.206
Damn thing's itchy, do we
really have to use horsehair?

16:06.239 --> 16:07.875
You'll survive.

16:07.908 --> 16:09.909
It looks ridiculous,
we'll get got right away.

16:09.942 --> 16:11.611
So then don't get got then.

16:13.113 --> 16:16.183
You don't
need this no more.

16:26.927 --> 16:27.894
Ow!

16:32.465 --> 16:34.968
Glad you think it's funny.

16:43.109 --> 16:44.245
Do it again.

16:56.423 --> 16:57.658
Fuckin' dipshit.

17:25.352 --> 17:26.220
Nerves?

17:28.087 --> 17:29.489
I ain't know.

17:29.521 --> 17:32.192
What are we gonna do with him?

17:32.224 --> 17:33.092
Nothin'.

17:34.426 --> 17:37.230
He's staying back with you.

17:37.262 --> 17:40.000
Just the two of us
covering the First Arkansas?

17:40.032 --> 17:41.300
Yup.

17:41.334 --> 17:42.603
I can step in.

17:44.304 --> 17:45.538
You ain't ready.

17:45.571 --> 17:47.039
Doolin can handle more.

17:47.073 --> 17:47.942
Not yet!

17:50.309 --> 17:51.244
We can wait.

17:51.278 --> 17:54.014
Hit the banks in a few
days, let it settle.

17:54.047 --> 17:57.416
Heck's been on our asses ever
since Southern Mississippi.

17:57.450 --> 17:59.686
Genie says he was
Dearing yesterday.

17:59.719 --> 18:00.653
I ain't your nanny.

18:00.686 --> 18:03.322
You'll be on sittin'
duty for a bit, son.

18:03.355 --> 18:04.758
I ain't your son.

18:04.790 --> 18:06.425
You ain't my brother neither.

18:06.459 --> 18:08.327
They brought a
power stay back then.

18:08.361 --> 18:11.198
You walked away
from this gang once.

18:11.230 --> 18:15.702
You want back in, you'll do
whatever job I tell you to.

18:16.603 --> 18:17.738
Bob.

18:17.770 --> 18:19.071
We need to talk
about the beards.

18:19.105 --> 18:20.007
Damn it!

18:20.039 --> 18:21.074
Emmett, they know your face.

18:21.106 --> 18:22.209
They know your face too!

18:22.241 --> 18:24.577
They probably
know all our faces.

18:24.611 --> 18:26.580
So why ain't you wearing one?

18:26.613 --> 18:31.518
Some people give two
shits, some people give none.

18:31.550 --> 18:32.485
If you don't want to wear it,

18:32.519 --> 18:33.487
grow a beard by tomorrow.

18:33.519 --> 18:34.320
It'll take him a year.

18:34.354 --> 18:35.721
I can grow a beard.

18:35.755 --> 18:37.691
Grab you some milk and
let the hens peck it off.

18:40.259 --> 18:42.762
Hey, bring him over
here, I'll milk him.

18:42.796 --> 18:44.096
Gotta have tits for that.

18:49.803 --> 18:50.738
Hey.

18:50.770 --> 18:53.472
Broad and me been fixin'
to ask you something.

18:53.506 --> 18:54.408
Yeah?

18:54.441 --> 18:56.175
Isn't you the oldest brother?

18:56.209 --> 18:57.244
Yeah.

18:57.277 --> 19:00.346
Why ain't you leader then?

19:00.380 --> 19:03.383
Pa always told us to
follow our God given talents.

19:03.415 --> 19:06.419
Truth is, some men
are born leaders,

19:08.488 --> 19:10.423
some men are born for whorin'.

19:16.563 --> 19:19.499
You know, the Condon
don't work without Bill.

19:19.531 --> 19:22.134
Grat can handle it.

19:22.167 --> 19:23.569
Grat's running the team?

19:23.603 --> 19:25.072
Yeah.

19:25.105 --> 19:28.474
And you think
that's a good idea?

19:28.508 --> 19:30.376
Those are the only
kind of ideas I got.

19:30.410 --> 19:32.046
I'm serious, Bob.

19:32.878 --> 19:35.448
I ain't worried about Grat.

19:36.548 --> 19:37.384
Bob?

19:37.416 --> 19:38.551
Emmett!

19:38.585 --> 19:40.821
You're mighty uppity
all of a sudden.

19:40.854 --> 19:41.688
Trade us.

19:41.721 --> 19:42.556
No!

19:42.588 --> 19:43.423
That ain't a bad idea.

19:43.455 --> 19:44.390
I said no!

19:44.423 --> 19:46.425
Well, Grat can't do it.

19:46.459 --> 19:47.827
The kid's right.

19:47.861 --> 19:51.198
I ain't remember asking
for your input, Doolin.

19:51.230 --> 19:52.465
No one needs to get hurt.

19:52.499 --> 19:53.432
He'll probably show up drunk,

19:53.465 --> 19:54.567
hit somebody in the noggin.

19:54.601 --> 19:55.536
You remember
what happened with-

19:55.568 --> 19:57.837
- You hear what I said
or is you too dense?

19:57.871 --> 19:58.772
You ain't listening.

19:58.805 --> 20:00.407
Shut your God damn mouth!

20:00.440 --> 20:01.274
Bob.

20:01.307 --> 20:02.209
Don't "Bob" me, boy!

20:02.241 --> 20:03.409
Oh, poppycock.

20:03.442 --> 20:05.211
I guess we're back
at this again already.

20:05.244 --> 20:05.878
Bob, just-

20:05.912 --> 20:07.279
- Step down, Emmett.

20:07.313 --> 20:09.182
I'm tired of this
leech leeching.

20:09.214 --> 20:10.817
Suckin' and going,
suckin' and going.

20:10.849 --> 20:12.184
Who are you calling leech?

20:12.218 --> 20:13.120
You.

20:13.153 --> 20:14.121
You want to reminisce again

20:14.153 --> 20:14.855
on why I left in
the first place?

20:14.887 --> 20:16.188
You mention one more word and-

20:16.221 --> 20:17.190
- Then you'll what, Bob?

20:17.222 --> 20:18.759
Pull out your knife?

20:20.359 --> 20:21.227
Try me.

20:23.163 --> 20:25.332
You were trimmin' the
take and we all know it.

20:25.365 --> 20:27.467
Bill and I pulled
2,500 from that train,

20:27.500 --> 20:28.535
where'd the other 500 go?

20:28.567 --> 20:29.836
Shut it!

20:29.868 --> 20:31.270
What'd you spend it on?

20:31.304 --> 20:32.605
That's enough.

20:32.638 --> 20:34.373
What was it, Bob?

20:34.406 --> 20:36.342
The booze, the cards?

20:36.375 --> 20:37.576
Don't.

20:37.609 --> 20:39.445
Or maybe that whore.

20:41.280 --> 20:42.448
Walk it down.

20:45.417 --> 20:47.386
I said walk it down now.

21:05.805 --> 21:07.574
She ain't no whore.

21:07.606 --> 21:09.675
You all know it's true.

21:10.977 --> 21:13.647
He pinched the cut, got some
of all of y'all's money.

21:13.680 --> 21:14.548
Enough.

21:16.415 --> 21:17.550
You know it's true.

21:17.584 --> 21:18.919
I ain't give no shits.

21:18.951 --> 21:20.220
You should.

21:21.453 --> 21:23.656
You best hobble your lip.

21:24.557 --> 21:25.692
Bust your head open,

21:25.724 --> 21:28.360
see if candy falls
out of there, amigo.

21:28.394 --> 21:29.695
Doolin, please.

21:36.970 --> 21:38.637
Fine.

21:38.671 --> 21:40.941
Blood always, it's bullshit.

21:43.308 --> 21:46.812
Just focus on the
banks, nothing else.

21:46.846 --> 21:49.182
He ain't no Jesse James.

21:50.250 --> 21:50.884
Whoa.

21:55.255 --> 21:57.224
Damn right about that.

21:58.790 --> 22:00.693
It's best you remember,

22:00.727 --> 22:02.663
only reason you is here

22:03.730 --> 22:05.365
is because my
brother trusts you.

22:11.403 --> 22:12.673
Blood, always.

22:23.583 --> 22:24.517
Shit.

22:24.549 --> 22:25.418
What?

22:28.020 --> 22:29.755
I think I'm sober.

22:43.836 --> 22:45.005
How about this?

22:45.038 --> 22:47.307
You take Grat, I'll
handle the Condon.

22:47.339 --> 22:48.907
Grat will be fine.

22:48.941 --> 22:50.009
He's probably
gonna show up drunk,

22:50.042 --> 22:52.378
bang somebody over the head.

22:52.412 --> 22:54.547
It's a no gun town.

22:54.579 --> 22:56.048
He ain't gonna hurt nobody.

22:56.082 --> 22:57.651
I can lead.

22:57.683 --> 23:00.287
What part of no
you ain't pick up on?

23:00.319 --> 23:02.489
I ain't need you
watching over me.

23:02.521 --> 23:04.957
You taking a kerfuffle now?

23:04.990 --> 23:06.593
I'm tired of the mistakes.

23:06.625 --> 23:07.560
Mistakes?

23:08.560 --> 23:10.462
Please, enlighten me.

23:10.496 --> 23:12.932
If we only got 5, I
can handle the Condon.

23:12.964 --> 23:14.366
You ain't ready.

23:14.400 --> 23:17.571
Stop treating me
like a God damn kid!

23:19.105 --> 23:20.673
You seems to got a big opinion

23:20.707 --> 23:22.342
all of a sudden, baby brother.

23:22.375 --> 23:23.476
And that's another thing,

23:23.509 --> 23:25.444
don't call me baby
brother no more neither.

23:25.478 --> 23:29.015
Seems like someone buttoned
his britches this morning.

23:29.048 --> 23:31.050
I ain't scared of you, Bob.

23:31.084 --> 23:32.786
That would be
your mistake then.

23:32.818 --> 23:33.986
You're starting to slip,

23:34.019 --> 23:35.587
and I'm trying to clean it up.

23:35.621 --> 23:36.823
You think you can run
this gang better than me?

23:36.855 --> 23:37.990
Guys...

23:38.023 --> 23:38.924
The beards is awful.

23:38.958 --> 23:40.393
Don't start.

23:40.425 --> 23:41.360
- They look stupid as shit.
- You don't start!

23:41.394 --> 23:42.761
We're already one man down!

23:42.795 --> 23:44.364
We might be one more
if you don't watch

23:44.396 --> 23:46.598
your God damn
tongue with me, boy!

23:50.536 --> 23:51.738
Come now, boys.

23:51.770 --> 23:54.374
That's no way to treat a lady.

24:14.026 --> 24:14.894
Miss me?

24:18.865 --> 24:19.732
Maybe.

24:24.403 --> 24:26.339
You boys at it again?

24:27.105 --> 24:28.107
No, ma'am.

24:29.575 --> 24:30.977
Emmett?

24:31.009 --> 24:34.347
You're getting
handsomer every minute.

24:36.848 --> 24:37.717
Well?

24:39.484 --> 24:40.953
Just like Mr. Doolin said.

24:40.987 --> 24:41.921
No guns?

24:41.953 --> 24:43.522
No guns.

24:43.556 --> 24:45.491
Not even the Marshal.

24:45.525 --> 24:46.626
Deputies?

24:46.659 --> 24:48.962
Far as I can
tell, just the one.

24:48.994 --> 24:50.396
Rumor is, he's
retired and become

24:50.430 --> 24:52.966
a school principal or something.

24:54.901 --> 24:55.769
Rifles?

24:56.903 --> 24:58.471
Keeps 'em on the
wall in the office.

24:58.503 --> 24:59.872
That's good.

24:59.905 --> 25:01.540
That's real good.

25:03.041 --> 25:04.009
Heck Thomas?

25:04.042 --> 25:05.811
No sign that I can tell.

25:05.845 --> 25:06.679
That's good.

25:06.711 --> 25:07.881
That's real good.

25:09.080 --> 25:10.516
You bring it?

25:16.788 --> 25:18.057
Ooh!

25:18.089 --> 25:19.024
Ow, ow, ow!

25:33.105 --> 25:34.473
Oh, Grat.

25:34.507 --> 25:35.174
Yeah?

25:36.541 --> 25:39.478
You ain't think
I forgot about ya?

25:44.683 --> 25:46.920
You want to tell him or me?

25:48.186 --> 25:49.054
What?

25:51.089 --> 25:52.658
Well, what is it?

25:53.692 --> 25:54.760
Oh, ladies.

26:06.705 --> 26:07.807
This for me?

26:07.839 --> 26:09.608
You can all share in on that.

26:09.642 --> 26:10.644
Fun's on me.

26:14.513 --> 26:15.548
Pretty enough.

26:17.583 --> 26:18.451
Now, boys.

26:20.586 --> 26:21.855
Sunrise, boys.

26:23.722 --> 26:24.590
Sharp.

26:29.561 --> 26:30.829
Well?

26:30.863 --> 26:32.265
You was right, Miss Moore.

26:32.298 --> 26:33.967
He is awfully cute.

26:35.268 --> 26:36.935
Careful, Bunny.

26:36.969 --> 26:39.005
He's a stone cold killer.

27:50.076 --> 27:52.211
Finally upright, are we?

27:54.313 --> 27:56.883
The things they make us do.

27:56.915 --> 27:57.783
They.

27:58.784 --> 27:59.653
They.

28:01.220 --> 28:02.989
Wouldn't know.

28:03.021 --> 28:06.792
Did I ever tell you about
Doolin and I's first pickup?

28:06.826 --> 28:08.227
No.

28:08.259 --> 28:09.929
Stole our first wagon,

28:09.961 --> 28:12.097
this broad comes running out,

28:12.131 --> 28:13.199
jumps in the back of the board

28:13.231 --> 28:15.335
as we was gettin' gone.

28:15.367 --> 28:18.136
Farmers comes out and blasts
off two shots and yells,

28:18.170 --> 28:21.074
"Bring her back and
nobody gets hurt!"

28:21.106 --> 28:25.211
Doolin yells, "We ain't
want your missus!"

28:25.243 --> 28:27.779
Farmer says, "Not
her, the horse!

28:27.813 --> 28:30.750
I can always get
me a better wife."

28:32.852 --> 28:33.720
Right.

28:34.720 --> 28:35.855
You don't believe me?

28:35.887 --> 28:37.089
I suppose so.

28:40.092 --> 28:41.828
All I'm saying is,

28:43.162 --> 28:45.965
you could find yourself
a better horse.

28:45.998 --> 28:47.734
'Cause that one?

28:47.767 --> 28:50.370
She's already found her wagon.

28:50.403 --> 28:51.269
I know.

28:55.141 --> 28:57.844
Do I really gotta stay back?

28:57.876 --> 28:58.744
Yup.

29:00.211 --> 29:02.347
Is that your call or his?

29:02.381 --> 29:04.984
It's good to be the king.

29:05.017 --> 29:06.885
It ain't right.

29:06.919 --> 29:07.921
Maybe not.

29:09.954 --> 29:11.957
Are you gonna be okay?

29:12.892 --> 29:14.894
I'm sure we'll manage.

29:16.461 --> 29:17.663
I hope so.

29:49.028 --> 29:49.895
Shut up!

30:19.525 --> 30:20.393
Oh, man.

30:27.133 --> 30:28.000
What?

30:30.469 --> 30:32.305
You said sunrise.

34:54.733 --> 34:55.601
Whoa.

34:59.637 --> 35:00.472
What?

35:01.572 --> 35:02.442
Bob?

35:04.409 --> 35:05.610
What the hell?

35:05.643 --> 35:06.644
The post.

35:06.677 --> 35:07.612
What post?

35:07.646 --> 35:10.016
The hitching post is gone.

35:11.382 --> 35:12.784
We should go.

35:12.818 --> 35:13.753
No.

35:13.786 --> 35:15.121
We're already down one,

35:15.153 --> 35:16.121
we can't leave one more
out for the horses.

35:16.155 --> 35:17.323
I said no.

35:17.356 --> 35:18.358
Excuse me.

35:19.391 --> 35:20.693
Where's the hitch?

35:20.726 --> 35:22.628
Pulled it out last night.

35:22.661 --> 35:26.733
Town gonna curb up the
main street in a few days.

35:28.434 --> 35:30.669
Does he seem like
a tough guy to you?

35:30.702 --> 35:34.673
Everybody's a tough guy until
you put a gun in their face.

35:34.706 --> 35:36.376
We should settle.

35:37.275 --> 35:38.777
This is a bad idea.

35:38.811 --> 35:40.646
We'll find another spot.

35:40.679 --> 35:41.514
Bob.

35:41.547 --> 35:42.481
Emmett.

35:42.514 --> 35:43.383
Mount up.

39:12.023 --> 39:13.592
Get on the floor!

39:19.030 --> 39:20.333
Manager, now!

39:23.902 --> 39:25.304
Please, I'll cooperate!

39:25.336 --> 39:27.405
No one needs to get hurt.

39:29.041 --> 39:30.243
The vault.

39:34.445 --> 39:35.380
Hands up!

39:39.583 --> 39:41.786
You want to be a tough guy?

39:43.387 --> 39:44.257
No.

39:45.389 --> 39:47.025
Hands on the
damn counter, now.

39:47.059 --> 39:48.661
Do what he says!

39:50.494 --> 39:51.496
All of it.

39:53.097 --> 39:54.932
What you waitin' for?

39:54.965 --> 39:58.304
He said to put my
hands on the counter.

39:58.336 --> 39:59.505
The money's down below,

39:59.538 --> 40:01.639
how am I supposed to
fill up these bags

40:01.672 --> 40:03.975
with my hands on the counter?

40:04.943 --> 40:06.879
Use them hands for anything

40:06.911 --> 40:08.946
other than fillin' them bags,

40:08.980 --> 40:10.081
and I'll blow your eyeballs

40:10.114 --> 40:12.917
all over that back wall.

40:26.130 --> 40:26.998
Hurry up!

40:31.503 --> 40:32.972
Where's the gold?

40:42.914 --> 40:44.616
Dalton Gang.

40:44.648 --> 40:46.085
Cyrus.

40:46.117 --> 40:47.820
You all right?

40:47.853 --> 40:50.623
Dalton Gang's
robbing the bank.

40:59.463 --> 41:01.599
What the hell's wrong with you?

41:01.632 --> 41:03.935
They're stealing your money!

41:03.969 --> 41:05.003
Oh, yeah?

41:05.036 --> 41:06.704
Which bank?

41:06.737 --> 41:07.605
Both!

41:19.751 --> 41:21.354
The Dalton Gang!

41:25.123 --> 41:26.025
Oh, shit.

41:40.172 --> 41:41.974
Hungry or hungover?

41:43.007 --> 41:44.442
A bit of both.

41:45.643 --> 41:50.048
Best way to cure the latter
is to never stop drinking.

41:58.789 --> 42:00.925
So, you thought more about it?

42:00.958 --> 42:02.594
About what?

42:02.626 --> 42:04.630
What you're gonna
do with the money?

42:04.663 --> 42:05.998
Don't know yet.

42:09.634 --> 42:11.702
I'm gonna buy a gravestone.

42:11.735 --> 42:13.004
A real nice one.

42:15.507 --> 42:16.809
Gravestone?

42:16.842 --> 42:18.010
Yup.

42:18.043 --> 42:19.577
Already know what
I'm gonna put on it.

42:19.610 --> 42:20.746
What's that?

42:22.112 --> 42:24.482
Secret to life.

42:24.516 --> 42:26.518
Figured that out, did you?

42:26.550 --> 42:27.420
I did.

42:28.686 --> 42:30.489
Well then, do tell.

42:34.059 --> 42:38.630
The secret to life is
finding a good woman.

42:38.663 --> 42:41.800
One that can cook,
one that can clean,

42:42.701 --> 42:44.603
one that can make love.

42:46.570 --> 42:48.606
Then you make sure none
of the four ever meet.

42:51.610 --> 42:54.146
You're a piece of art.

42:54.179 --> 42:55.481
Yeah.

42:55.514 --> 42:56.949
Modern day Shakespeare
or something.

43:02.987 --> 43:06.057
We're gonna have
to talk about Bob.

43:07.192 --> 43:08.927
Yeah, I know.

43:08.960 --> 43:11.262
It's getting worse.

43:11.295 --> 43:13.031
Grat's just a grunt.

43:15.099 --> 43:17.268
Did I ever tell you
they used to be lawmen?

43:17.302 --> 43:19.605
Bob and Emmett?

43:19.637 --> 43:20.873
Bob and Grat.

43:22.740 --> 43:23.842
Emmett was too young,

43:23.875 --> 43:25.844
he just kind of
followed them around.

43:25.876 --> 43:27.480
Grat the lawman?

43:28.579 --> 43:30.681
Yeah, that only lasted a week.

43:30.715 --> 43:32.784
They didn't get paid,

43:32.817 --> 43:35.019
so they just robbed
a horse instead.

43:37.755 --> 43:39.557
Sounds about right.

43:42.893 --> 43:45.930
They wanted to avenge Frank.

43:45.963 --> 43:47.833
They decided they
liked the money

43:47.865 --> 43:49.601
a bit more, I guess.

43:51.802 --> 43:54.172
Frank's a good man.

43:54.204 --> 43:55.074
Yeah.

43:56.041 --> 43:58.210
Not all Daltons is like us.

43:59.911 --> 44:03.014
You ain't like
most of them neither.

44:08.052 --> 44:10.321
Frank came in and told pa

44:10.355 --> 44:13.057
that he was gonna be a marshal.

44:15.193 --> 44:18.764
Pa had this expression
on his face,

44:18.797 --> 44:20.865
and I'll never forget it.

44:23.335 --> 44:25.938
You ain't gotta say nothin'.

44:32.210 --> 44:34.045
Frank and his partner
went to catch a bounty

44:34.079 --> 44:35.548
near Fort Smith.

44:37.114 --> 44:39.851
Posse saw 'em coming and set up.

44:42.954 --> 44:45.891
One of them shot
Frank in the chest.

44:45.923 --> 44:49.561
His whole insides was
opened up, they said.

44:51.228 --> 44:53.965
His partner thought he was dead,

44:55.032 --> 44:57.302
so he tailed out quick-like.

44:59.804 --> 45:02.740
Frank sat up and
took 18 more shots.

45:06.311 --> 45:09.615
Took him 12 hours
to bleed it all out.

45:09.648 --> 45:13.719
But pa used to have a
saying, "Daltons die slow."

45:14.952 --> 45:16.755
I guess he was right.

45:20.025 --> 45:20.893
Damn.

45:23.193 --> 45:24.663
Blood, always.

45:30.668 --> 45:32.170
Come on!

45:32.202 --> 45:33.605
Hurry, come on!

45:43.313 --> 45:45.016
Who the hell was that?

45:45.050 --> 45:46.185
The manager.

45:51.389 --> 45:52.990
Fast.

45:53.023 --> 45:53.891
Faster!

45:55.159 --> 45:57.261
Cover the windows, now!

45:59.898 --> 46:00.766
Cash.

46:00.798 --> 46:02.134
Fill 'em up.

46:15.914 --> 46:18.116
I didn't come for
no damn silver.

46:18.148 --> 46:21.019
You're gonna take
me to the vault.

46:23.420 --> 46:24.355
Sit down!

46:46.478 --> 46:48.046
Hurry up!

47:11.902 --> 47:13.971
That would not be wise.

47:22.012 --> 47:23.248
Hell yeah!

47:23.280 --> 47:24.949
I told you!

47:24.983 --> 47:26.318
Yes you did, big brother!

47:26.351 --> 47:27.352
Yes you did!

47:27.385 --> 47:28.887
Let's go.

47:44.902 --> 47:46.504
Isham, what's going on?

47:46.538 --> 47:48.240
The Dalton Gang is
in the banks right now

47:48.273 --> 47:50.375
trying to run off
with your money.

47:50.407 --> 47:51.809
Bullshit!

47:51.842 --> 47:54.211
They're in the Condon
and the First right now.

47:54.244 --> 47:55.079
Both?

47:55.112 --> 47:55.946
Yup.

47:55.980 --> 47:57.115
At the same time?

47:57.148 --> 47:58.550
I didn't believe
it neither at first.

47:58.583 --> 47:59.951
We ain't armed!

47:59.983 --> 48:01.519
I got rifles
for three or four,

48:01.552 --> 48:03.521
hardware gots about 10.

48:05.155 --> 48:06.358
Jeb.

48:06.391 --> 48:08.393
You wasn't supposed
to have that there.

48:08.425 --> 48:09.994
Arrest me then.

48:14.199 --> 48:15.333
What am I supposed
to do with that?

48:15.365 --> 48:16.400
Stop them from
getting out of town

48:16.434 --> 48:17.569
with our damn money.

48:17.601 --> 48:18.903
Yeah!

48:20.572 --> 48:22.106
I didn't fight
for no Union army

48:22.139 --> 48:25.176
to let some sons of bitches
take my town like this!

48:25.210 --> 48:26.311
Yeah!

48:27.378 --> 48:28.280
Well, we need cover!

48:28.313 --> 48:29.213
I got the top!

48:29.246 --> 48:30.382
Me too, let's go!

48:55.340 --> 48:57.309
Do you hear that?

48:57.342 --> 48:58.343
Hear what?

49:00.077 --> 49:00.913
Listen.

49:08.085 --> 49:10.054
Calm yourself.

49:10.088 --> 49:12.057
No, really, listen.

49:13.925 --> 49:14.593
Let's go.

49:15.659 --> 49:17.228
I ain't going nowhere.

49:17.262 --> 49:20.399
Probably just Grat
being a dung again.

49:29.373 --> 49:30.942
Yeah, okay.

49:32.643 --> 49:34.078
Bill, you're the
smartest Dalton-

49:34.112 --> 49:35.247
- Come with me!

49:35.280 --> 49:36.481
If we ain't get out of here

49:36.514 --> 49:37.615
and protect what's
left of the money-

49:37.648 --> 49:39.984
- This ain't about the money!

49:40.018 --> 49:41.253
If any of them make it,

49:41.286 --> 49:42.420
they know where to find us.

49:42.452 --> 49:43.621
Yeah, and if none
of them make it-

49:43.655 --> 49:45.290
- They ain't Frank!

49:47.992 --> 49:49.594
And I ain't his partner.

49:49.626 --> 49:52.297
They knew what they
were walking into.

49:52.329 --> 49:53.530
Yeah.

49:53.565 --> 49:55.666
And I ain't never leaving any
of my brothers behind again.

49:55.699 --> 49:57.134
Bill, please.

49:58.635 --> 50:00.471
Blood, always.

50:00.505 --> 50:02.440
Just 'cause we ain't blood

50:02.472 --> 50:05.009
don't mean we ain't brothers.

50:08.211 --> 50:09.648
If I ain't back in an
hour you get to the caves,

50:09.681 --> 50:11.615
you wait for me there.

51:26.623 --> 51:27.491
Get up.

52:01.659 --> 52:02.527
Yeah!

52:06.797 --> 52:07.665
Woo!

52:09.634 --> 52:10.501
Woo!

52:11.668 --> 52:12.536
Oh, yeah!

52:13.538 --> 52:14.672
Damn it, damn it!

52:14.704 --> 52:16.173
Emmett?

52:16.206 --> 52:17.074
What?

52:17.809 --> 52:19.377
No, no, you must be mistaken.

52:19.409 --> 52:20.377
Emmett.

52:20.411 --> 52:21.646
Hot damn, Emmett.

52:21.679 --> 52:25.115
And that must be your
brother Grat, or Bill.

52:25.148 --> 52:28.118
Leon, do you know these men?

52:28.152 --> 52:29.287
Oh, yeah.

52:29.320 --> 52:32.257
They used to scrap
with the Baldwin boys.

52:32.289 --> 52:33.690
I think they're
members of that gang,

52:33.724 --> 52:36.061
the Youngers or something.

52:37.695 --> 52:39.530
- No, wait a minute.
- Bob.

52:39.563 --> 52:40.664
Now hold on a second!

52:40.697 --> 52:41.766
Bob.

52:41.798 --> 52:43.300
Now hold on.

52:43.333 --> 52:44.435
Leon!

52:49.273 --> 52:50.240
Daltons!

52:50.273 --> 52:52.043
The God damn Daltons!

52:55.679 --> 52:56.681
Say it!

52:56.713 --> 52:58.115
Say it so we can hear ya!

52:58.148 --> 52:59.150
Say it!

52:59.182 --> 53:00.117
Daltons...

53:20.403 --> 53:21.606
That's right.

53:26.777 --> 53:28.646
We're the Dalton Gang.

53:30.614 --> 53:32.349
Don't you forget it.

53:36.887 --> 53:39.190
Please, just stay down.

53:41.525 --> 53:42.393
Please.

53:53.704 --> 53:55.106
Come, ladies.

54:02.445 --> 54:03.380
Lively now.

54:09.920 --> 54:11.322
Hurry, hurry!

54:39.550 --> 54:40.818
Just the gold.

54:48.960 --> 54:51.563
What the shit you waitin' for?

54:56.434 --> 54:59.204
The vault's on a timer.

54:59.237 --> 55:02.273
What the hell does that mean?

55:02.306 --> 55:03.240
The safe's got a timer,

55:03.273 --> 55:04.842
it can only be opened
up every 30 minutes.

55:08.746 --> 55:10.280
Is that so?

55:15.353 --> 55:16.221
How long?

55:17.989 --> 55:19.423
Can I check my watch?

55:19.456 --> 55:20.791
Nothing funny.

55:20.824 --> 55:21.692
No, sir.

55:29.000 --> 55:30.467
9:20.

55:30.501 --> 55:31.669
The vault only opens on the 30s,

55:31.702 --> 55:34.005
and we opened at 9.

55:34.038 --> 55:35.907
What the hell does that mean?

55:35.940 --> 55:37.942
I'm sorry, sir, but it's
gonna be at least 10 minutes

55:37.974 --> 55:39.443
before I can open it.

55:49.753 --> 55:51.722
Is there any other way in?

55:51.755 --> 55:53.357
No, sir.

55:53.391 --> 55:54.526
Only this one.

56:00.331 --> 56:00.966
Fine.

56:03.634 --> 56:04.603
We'll wait.

56:07.070 --> 56:07.938
Go, go!

57:06.364 --> 57:09.067
We're the Dalton Gang,
don't ever forget it.

57:09.099 --> 57:11.769
We're the God damn Dalton gang.

57:27.518 --> 57:29.019
What the hell was that?

57:36.159 --> 57:37.828
Emmett, get your ass down!

57:41.532 --> 57:43.867
Over there, get down!

57:43.900 --> 57:46.370
Or else the people out
there will kill some of you!

57:49.773 --> 57:50.641
I'm hit!

57:51.742 --> 57:52.744
Bob, not the baby.

57:52.777 --> 57:54.378
I said get down!

57:57.614 --> 57:59.483
I can't move my arm!

58:00.985 --> 58:02.820
I can't move my arm!

58:06.956 --> 58:08.893
Bob, let the girl go.

58:12.028 --> 58:13.864
Put the gun down.

58:13.898 --> 58:15.133
Let 'em go.

58:15.166 --> 58:16.768
You want to die
in this damn place?

58:16.800 --> 58:18.168
If I gots to.

58:18.202 --> 58:20.138
Now you're some
saint all of a sudden.

58:20.170 --> 58:21.772
We both know I ain't,

58:21.806 --> 58:24.141
but I ain't living
on me or the baby.

58:24.175 --> 58:27.745
You ain't got the
balls, baby brother.

58:27.777 --> 58:30.848
I told you to stop
calling me that.

01:00:56.126 --> 01:00:58.162
Grat, almost out!

01:01:05.135 --> 01:01:06.170
Hey!

01:01:06.202 --> 01:01:07.304
When will it open?

01:01:07.338 --> 01:01:08.172
What?

01:01:08.204 --> 01:01:09.306
The damn safe!

01:01:09.340 --> 01:01:11.142
You said 10 minutes,
how much longer?

01:01:11.175 --> 01:01:12.877
What?

01:01:14.344 --> 01:01:16.680
Shit, shit, shit!

01:01:18.181 --> 01:01:19.048
Come on!

01:01:25.021 --> 01:01:25.956
Go, go, go!

01:01:37.067 --> 01:01:37.934
There's a backdoor.

01:01:37.967 --> 01:01:38.835
Tommy!

01:01:40.637 --> 01:01:43.106
You let her go, I'll show ya.

01:01:57.755 --> 01:02:00.090
Stay low, stay low.

01:02:19.342 --> 01:02:22.614
We got
the baby coming out!

01:02:25.449 --> 01:02:27.151
What's behind it?

01:02:27.184 --> 01:02:28.719
A tree row.

01:02:28.751 --> 01:02:30.121
How far out?

01:02:30.153 --> 01:02:31.054
A quarter mile.

01:02:31.088 --> 01:02:32.723
I don't know, there's a creek.

01:02:32.755 --> 01:02:33.958
From there, which way?

01:02:33.990 --> 01:02:37.061
Follow the bed
east a couple miles,

01:02:38.762 --> 01:02:41.332
you'll reach some verdigris.

01:02:41.364 --> 01:02:42.932
We hit it running,

01:02:42.965 --> 01:02:45.902
don't stop 'til we
cross the river.

01:02:47.003 --> 01:02:48.139
Open it.

01:02:55.713 --> 01:02:56.914
Get in, get in!

01:03:00.451 --> 01:03:02.786
I'm sure you think
you're so damn smart.

01:03:02.820 --> 01:03:05.023
We'll see how smart you is.

01:03:07.757 --> 01:03:08.958
No, no, no, no, no, no!

01:03:08.992 --> 01:03:09.894
You're crazy!

01:03:09.927 --> 01:03:11.729
Go, go, go, go, go!

01:03:18.302 --> 01:03:21.172
Stay low, take top, take top!

01:04:43.119 --> 01:04:44.387
We're coming up.

01:04:44.420 --> 01:04:46.022
Don't try nothin'.

01:04:49.559 --> 01:04:52.096
Don't shoot, I ain't armed.

01:04:57.501 --> 01:04:59.136
On the ground.

01:04:59.168 --> 01:05:00.871
Face down, hands up.

01:05:07.476 --> 01:05:10.079
Nobody's gonna pop up
and try nothing, is they?

01:05:10.112 --> 01:05:12.315
It's just me, I swear it.

01:05:37.940 --> 01:05:39.542
Out of the way!

01:05:39.576 --> 01:05:40.978
Out of the way!

01:05:42.079 --> 01:05:42.947
Frank!

01:06:00.664 --> 01:06:02.133
Bob, you okay?

01:06:06.202 --> 01:06:09.340
You want to catch me on what's
so damn funny right now?

01:06:09.373 --> 01:06:10.206
Bill.

01:06:10.239 --> 01:06:11.107
Bill?

01:06:14.378 --> 01:06:16.881
I told him not
to eat that shit.

01:06:16.914 --> 01:06:19.917
There's no such thing
as oysters in Kansas.

01:06:19.949 --> 01:06:21.618
He kept blaming the whisky!

01:06:26.389 --> 01:06:28.358
Doolin thought
it was the nurse.

01:06:28.391 --> 01:06:30.393
Doolin can pucker my ass cap.

01:06:48.277 --> 01:06:51.147
Why are you
telling me this now?

01:06:56.018 --> 01:06:59.555
'Cause we're gonna die
today, little brother.

01:06:59.588 --> 01:07:01.324
We ain't gonna die.

01:07:03.126 --> 01:07:04.161
We is.

01:07:04.193 --> 01:07:05.161
We ain't.

01:07:08.699 --> 01:07:10.434
I shoulda listened.

01:07:10.467 --> 01:07:11.903
Bob, not now.

01:07:14.371 --> 01:07:15.439
Doolin was right.

01:07:15.472 --> 01:07:16.674
Bob, not now!

01:07:17.974 --> 01:07:20.177
I skimmed the take.

01:07:20.210 --> 01:07:21.077
I know.

01:07:23.746 --> 01:07:24.614
How?

01:07:26.215 --> 01:07:27.484
I always know.

01:07:31.688 --> 01:07:34.025
It ain't what you think.

01:07:35.525 --> 01:07:37.994
She's pregnant, ain't she?

01:07:41.231 --> 01:07:43.467
I'm so sorry, Emmett.

01:07:43.500 --> 01:07:45.702
I didn't mean for none of this.

01:07:45.735 --> 01:07:49.472
And you was gonna
leave today, wasn't you?

01:07:50.673 --> 01:07:53.411
Was you really gonna shoot me?

01:07:54.311 --> 01:07:55.313
Hell yeah.

01:07:58.648 --> 01:08:00.317
Is there a back exit?

01:08:00.349 --> 01:08:04.387
There's a side door that
goes to Walnut Street.

01:08:10.693 --> 01:08:12.695
You got enough to run for it?

01:08:12.728 --> 01:08:14.564
I got a choice?

01:08:14.597 --> 01:08:15.733
Good enough.

01:08:16.765 --> 01:08:18.635
They're in the bank.

01:08:18.667 --> 01:08:20.304
When that door opens,

01:08:20.337 --> 01:08:23.140
don't stop 'til we
get to the horses.

01:08:23.171 --> 01:08:24.041
Come on.

01:08:32.448 --> 01:08:34.617
For the inconvenience.

01:08:56.773 --> 01:08:59.376
I'm gonna be an uncle.

01:08:59.408 --> 01:09:01.545
She's a peach, ain't she?

01:09:03.145 --> 01:09:04.014
She is.

01:09:05.282 --> 01:09:08.551
Don't know what she
sees in you though.

01:09:08.585 --> 01:09:09.685
Me neither.

01:09:17.426 --> 01:09:19.127
You think they're
gonna write about us

01:09:19.162 --> 01:09:20.765
in the Star tomorrow?

01:09:24.768 --> 01:09:27.304
Bigger story than
Jesse James ever got.

01:09:27.337 --> 01:09:28.805
Fuck Jesse James.

01:09:34.211 --> 01:09:35.179
They're coming in.

01:09:35.212 --> 01:09:36.447
That they is.

01:09:37.712 --> 01:09:39.582
Where do you want to go?

01:09:39.615 --> 01:09:43.319
I only remember
one gun out back.

01:09:43.353 --> 01:09:44.220
Hey.

01:09:44.252 --> 01:09:45.220
Hey, you!

01:09:45.255 --> 01:09:46.622
No, no, no!

01:09:46.654 --> 01:09:47.756
I ain't gonna hurt you,
I ain't gonna hurt you!

01:09:47.791 --> 01:09:49.725
Where's that boardwalk
around back go?

01:09:49.759 --> 01:09:50.694
The general store.

01:09:50.725 --> 01:09:53.197
Alley there head up street?

01:09:57.367 --> 01:09:58.302
If we clear past the agent,

01:09:58.335 --> 01:09:59.470
we can get straight to the alley

01:09:59.502 --> 01:10:00.470
and run like hell
for the horses.

01:10:00.503 --> 01:10:02.405
Yeah, it'll be
hell, all right.

01:10:02.439 --> 01:10:04.307
Any luck, we'll
blow past the rifles,

01:10:04.341 --> 01:10:05.709
maybe take a few nicks.

01:10:05.742 --> 01:10:07.677
Hopefully just a few.

01:10:08.677 --> 01:10:11.515
I think it's all we got.

01:10:11.547 --> 01:10:15.585
I always looked up
to you, baby brother.

01:10:15.618 --> 01:10:17.087
Blood, always.

01:10:18.354 --> 01:10:19.622
Blood, always.

01:10:27.363 --> 01:10:28.498
There they is!

01:10:41.545 --> 01:10:43.514
Aw, damn, Grat!

01:10:43.546 --> 01:10:45.414
Here's our chance!

01:11:08.371 --> 01:11:09.239
Gun.

01:11:54.583 --> 01:11:55.618
Halt, halt!

01:11:58.587 --> 01:11:59.889
He said halt!

01:11:59.922 --> 01:12:01.858
God damn it, Bob.

01:12:01.890 --> 01:12:03.594
I have to get that man.

01:12:06.496 --> 01:12:07.698
No, Luscious!

01:14:35.011 --> 01:14:35.879
Marshal!

01:14:43.787 --> 01:14:44.688
Easy.

01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:46.022
Easy, easy, easy.

01:15:32.202 --> 01:15:33.670
Bob, let's go!

01:16:15.712 --> 01:16:19.716
Get the horses, or we're
solidly through by now.

01:16:24.587 --> 01:16:25.222
Bob!

01:16:25.255 --> 01:16:26.590
Oh, God, no, no, no!

01:16:26.622 --> 01:16:28.491
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

01:16:28.524 --> 01:16:29.192
Get to the horses.

01:16:29.225 --> 01:16:31.094
I ain't leaving.

01:16:31.127 --> 01:16:33.997
Get to the God
damn horses, now!

01:16:52.849 --> 01:16:54.117
Yah, yah, yah!

01:17:40.029 --> 01:17:40.898
Bob, no!

01:17:42.664 --> 01:17:43.632
Goodbye, Emmett.

01:17:43.666 --> 01:17:44.301
No!

01:17:44.333 --> 01:17:45.835
No surrender.

01:18:49.297 --> 01:18:50.367
We got you!

01:20:24.460 --> 01:20:25.328
No more!

01:20:47.382 --> 01:20:49.019
Go to hell, Heck.

01:21:03.198 --> 01:21:05.469
We're gonna need a doctor.

01:23:02.518 --> 01:23:04.520
Surrounded
by federal marshals,

01:23:04.552 --> 01:23:07.556
auditors examined the monetary
damage of the incident

01:23:07.590 --> 01:23:09.125
the next morning.

01:23:10.259 --> 01:23:14.296
The Condon Bank reported
a loss of 20 dollars.

01:23:14.329 --> 01:23:17.033
The First Arkansas
reported a surplus

01:23:17.065 --> 01:23:19.135
of a dollar and 98 cents.

01:23:45.360 --> 01:23:47.262
Let the wicked
forsake his ways,

01:23:47.296 --> 01:23:50.466
and the unrighteous
man his thoughts.

01:23:50.498 --> 01:23:52.301
And let him return
unto the Lord,

01:23:52.335 --> 01:23:55.137
for he will have mercy upon him,

01:23:55.171 --> 01:23:58.575
and to our God, for
he will freely pardon.

01:24:03.578 --> 01:24:05.581
Where are my brothers?

01:24:13.355 --> 01:24:16.926
When I was 13, my
brother Henry ran off

01:24:18.060 --> 01:24:20.697
to fight with the Rebels.

01:24:20.729 --> 01:24:24.067
He had a stubbornness about him.

01:24:24.100 --> 01:24:27.537
He always found some way
to get his way, you know?

01:24:27.569 --> 01:24:29.204
Pa didn't worry
when Henry told us

01:24:29.238 --> 01:24:33.443
he would find his way back
home one way or another.

01:24:36.011 --> 01:24:38.213
His calvary crossed
Sherman's boys in Georgia,

01:24:38.247 --> 01:24:39.249
and, well...

01:24:45.287 --> 01:24:46.588
Ma asked if we
could carry him home

01:24:46.622 --> 01:24:49.392
so we could bury
him on the farm.

01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:55.331
The Bible was the only part
of him that made it back.

01:24:55.363 --> 01:24:57.366
I believe he knew he did
not break his promise

01:24:57.399 --> 01:24:58.667
to us after all.

01:25:02.438 --> 01:25:04.507
My brothers, they dead?

01:25:10.179 --> 01:25:11.381
I believe so.

01:25:16.752 --> 01:25:18.254
I'll kill them.

01:25:20.221 --> 01:25:22.125
Every last one of them.

01:25:24.460 --> 01:25:27.262
The book teaches
us to forgive.

01:25:28.596 --> 01:25:32.134
But not in the way we
have come to believe.

01:25:32.167 --> 01:25:36.104
Forgiveness is not condoning
the actions of others,

01:25:36.137 --> 01:25:40.510
but in not allowing our
past to dictate our present.

01:25:53.288 --> 01:25:57.226
I believe you are gonna
need this more than me.

01:26:03.666 --> 01:26:06.036
I ain't know how to read.

01:26:07.470 --> 01:26:11.841
I suppose you'll have
time to figure that out now.

01:26:11.873 --> 01:26:13.475
Trust in the Lord.

01:26:14.577 --> 01:26:17.480
Accept the grace of his mercy.

01:26:17.512 --> 01:26:21.650
Learn to forgive, and you
will find peace someday.

01:26:25.621 --> 01:26:28.824
God has a plan for
you yet, Mr. Dalton.

01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:47.143
23 gunshot
wounds would not be enough

01:26:47.176 --> 01:26:48.445
to end his life.

01:26:49.612 --> 01:26:52.381
After 3 months in the infirmary,

01:26:52.413 --> 01:26:55.384
a limp and several scars
would be the only keepsakes

01:26:55.417 --> 01:26:59.489
the youngest Dalton would
take out of the Kansas town.

01:26:59.521 --> 01:27:02.425
Lansing Penitentiary would
barely be able to contain

01:27:02.457 --> 01:27:04.192
the outpouring of support

01:27:04.225 --> 01:27:07.229
for their most famous inmate.

01:27:07.262 --> 01:27:10.399
Fathers would name
their sons after him.

01:27:10.431 --> 01:27:13.635
Bachelorettes would
write to him daily.

01:27:14.636 --> 01:27:16.404
Labeled a model prisoner,

01:27:16.438 --> 01:27:18.875
after only 14 years
into his life sentence,

01:27:18.908 --> 01:27:23.479
the governor, garnering
favor among his constituents,

01:27:23.511 --> 01:27:24.813
would pardon him.

01:27:25.914 --> 01:27:28.618
A year later, Emmett
would wed Julia,

01:27:28.650 --> 01:27:33.655
a childhood sweetheart,
and relocate to California.

01:27:34.789 --> 01:27:35.625
The fresh scenery
would prove fruitful

01:27:35.658 --> 01:27:37.393
to the young Dalton.

01:27:38.961 --> 01:27:41.864
After early success
in real estate,

01:27:41.896 --> 01:27:44.266
he would eventually
acquiesce to the request

01:27:44.300 --> 01:27:45.702
to tell his story.

01:27:46.868 --> 01:27:48.503
He would begin by
writing two books

01:27:48.537 --> 01:27:50.740
about his family legacy,

01:27:50.773 --> 01:27:52.608
join a public lecturer's circle

01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:55.344
speaking to sold out crowds,

01:27:55.377 --> 01:27:57.613
and eventually became an actor.

01:27:57.645 --> 01:28:00.248
First on stage,
and then on screen,

01:28:00.282 --> 01:28:03.786
even playing himself in
a film about the gang.

01:28:03.819 --> 01:28:05.922
Because his notoriety
would follow them

01:28:05.954 --> 01:28:07.756
wherever they would go,

01:28:07.789 --> 01:28:11.793
the couple would often
pine for a quieter life.

01:28:11.827 --> 01:28:16.199
To Julia's chagrin, the two
would travel the country,

01:28:16.231 --> 01:28:17.667
accepting the spotlight.

01:28:17.699 --> 01:28:19.434
And city after city,

01:28:20.603 --> 01:28:24.806
the routine grew stale,
and at times, torturous.

01:28:24.840 --> 01:28:27.610
But he would accept
the circle as penance

01:28:27.643 --> 01:28:29.244
for his past sins.

01:28:31.880 --> 01:28:35.318
Julia could do little to
absolve him of his guilt,

01:28:35.350 --> 01:28:36.985
and often wondered
if this pattern

01:28:37.019 --> 01:28:40.389
would carry them to their end.

01:28:40.421 --> 01:28:43.225
But in the spring of 1931,

01:28:43.259 --> 01:28:47.697
the youngest Dalton, now
the oldest by many decades,

01:28:47.729 --> 01:28:50.298
surprised even his
dutiful better half

01:28:50.332 --> 01:28:53.736
by accepting an
unconventional invitation.

01:28:56.604 --> 01:28:59.608
Today we recognize the
historical significance

01:28:59.641 --> 01:29:02.612
of what the Dalton Gang
did for our community.

01:29:02.645 --> 01:29:05.681
This day in Kansas
forever shall be known

01:29:05.713 --> 01:29:08.583
as the Coffeyville
Defenders Day.

01:29:12.287 --> 01:29:15.590
Commemorating forever
this section of our town,

01:29:15.623 --> 01:29:18.228
herein known as "Death Alley".

01:29:23.798 --> 01:29:26.902
He spoke nothing
about his brother's deaths,

01:29:26.935 --> 01:29:29.939
or the haunting faces of
the sons and grandsons

01:29:29.971 --> 01:29:31.706
in the crowd.

01:29:31.739 --> 01:29:34.010
He spoke only about his faith,

01:29:34.042 --> 01:29:38.380
reciting scripture, and
performing his famous phrase.

01:29:38.413 --> 01:29:40.649
The biggest fool on Earth

01:29:41.783 --> 01:29:45.520
is the one who thinks
he can beat the law.

01:29:45.554 --> 01:29:47.722
With no
animosity in either direction,

01:29:47.756 --> 01:29:50.026
the town offered only gratitude,

01:29:50.059 --> 01:29:53.663
welcoming the couple
with open arms.

01:29:53.695 --> 01:29:56.765
In its own paradox,
the town would fulfill

01:29:56.798 --> 01:29:58.801
his third and final act.

01:30:00.069 --> 01:30:03.339
For Emmett, this gesture
would prove to be

01:30:03.372 --> 01:30:05.408
the beautiful missing finale

01:30:05.440 --> 01:30:07.577
to the Dalton Gang's opus.

01:30:09.811 --> 01:30:14.016
In the summer of 1937, just
before his 67th winter,

01:30:16.051 --> 01:30:18.654
the youngest Dalton
would be the only Dalton

01:30:18.686 --> 01:30:21.056
to exit the stage peacefully.

01:30:22.791 --> 01:30:26.796
In his bed, holding Julia's
soft, wrinkled hand,

01:30:28.697 --> 01:30:31.567
he prayed, and
took his final bow.

01:30:45.480 --> 01:30:47.716
Now, you all didn't think
we were gonna leave you

01:30:47.750 --> 01:30:50.086
with a happy ending, did you?

01:32:00.655 --> 01:32:01.657
Now ain't that pretty?

01:32:01.689 --> 01:32:03.125
Burn in hell now, boys!

01:32:03.158 --> 01:32:05.161
A little bit of blood!

01:32:07.895 --> 01:32:09.864
Come on, now!

01:32:09.898 --> 01:32:11.734
String him up!

01:33:47.762 --> 01:33:49.097
Yah!

01:33:49.131 --> 01:33:50.733
Yah!

01:36:39.234 --> 01:36:40.703
Blood, always.
