I owe you guys one.

23:01.120 --> 23:04.380
(sighs)
Listen, I know I always
call you my baby.

23:04.380 --> 23:08.000
And, since you're 13,
I know I probably have to
let you grow up sometime, right?

23:08.920 --> 23:10.420
Thank you, Mom.

23:12.580 --> 23:14.330
You know what I think?

23:14.330 --> 23:17.290
I think we're all trying to
grow up just a little too fast.

23:17.290 --> 23:20.460
And a firetruck ride just
might be the fun we need.

23:21.620 --> 23:22.790
Wow.

23:22.790 --> 23:24.540
That's really mature of you.

23:24.540 --> 23:26.710
That's really, really
mature of you.

23:27.580 --> 23:28.830
So, who's with me?

23:28.830 --> 23:31.620
He's right!
We're not teenagers yet.

23:31.620 --> 23:33.790
Yeah. I mean,
we're still on the cusp.

23:33.790 --> 23:35.790
I'm on the cusp of the cusp.

23:35.790 --> 23:37.960
-I get to ring the bell!
-I get to work the siren!

23:37.960 --> 23:39.880
Finally, something postable!

23:39.880 --> 23:43.790
-(squealing) Are you getting it?
Are you getting it?
-Oh, yeah.

23:43.790 --> 23:46.880
Oh, 'cause these are the moments
a mother doesn't want to miss.

23:46.880 --> 23:48.620
Come on, Mom,
you're missing it.

23:48.620 --> 23:50.670
