Excuse me, uh, this may sound crazy,

01:59.244 --> 02:01.788
but I couldn't help but notice you
from across the room.

02:04.791 --> 02:07.169
- Hello.
- Hi.

02:08.962 --> 02:10.464
Love your smell.

02:11.173 --> 02:13.467
- I brought you something.
- What'd you get me?

02:13.550 --> 02:15.052
- What'd I get you?
- Hm?

02:15.135 --> 02:16.553
What'd I get you?

02:18.013 --> 02:19.306
Boom!

02:19.389 --> 02:21.433
- My favorite! Oh!
- Mm-hm.

02:21.516 --> 02:24.227
Why eat regular when you can go Tropical?

02:24.311 --> 02:26.355
- Yeah, Tropical.
- Mm-hm!

02:26.438 --> 02:27.397
All right, what you got?

02:27.481 --> 02:28.732
- What you been drawing?
- Mm!

02:28.815 --> 02:30.317
- Oh!
- Not yet.

02:30.400 --> 02:32.319
Is Bhoomi finally ready
to become a butterfly?

02:32.402 --> 02:33.403
- No.
- Uh-huh.

02:33.487 --> 02:34.905
She's perfectly fine just as she is.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.615
- Stop trying to change her.
- All right.

02:36.698 --> 02:38.784
So Roxy's tonight?

02:38.867 --> 02:41.078
- Or I was thinking...
- Mm-hm?

02:41.620 --> 02:44.664
how about we stay in and I can cook?

02:44.748 --> 02:47.417
- No, thanks.
- What do you mean?

02:47.501 --> 02:50.754
Baby, come on, you think I'll let you
back in the kitchen after last time?

02:50.837 --> 02:53.799
Wait a minute,
that was your mom's branzino recipe.

02:53.882 --> 02:56.218
- Your favorite.
- I don't know what that was.

02:56.301 --> 02:58.303
Never cooking for you again.

02:58.387 --> 02:59.221
Thank you.

03:03.850 --> 03:07.813
I got to go.

03:07.896 --> 03:09.147
- Why?
- Gotta go.

03:09.231 --> 03:10.857
- I got a meeting.
- Don't go.

03:10.941 --> 03:12.776
Babe, you know I'll be thinking about you.

03:12.859 --> 03:14.111
I wanna show you something.

03:14.736 --> 03:15.570
Oh.

03:15.654 --> 03:17.322
I knew you were here the whole time.

03:17.406 --> 03:19.032
Twist ending. How?

03:19.116 --> 03:21.326
Well, I could feel you.

03:21.410 --> 03:24.538
Also, I could see you
in that reflection with my eyes.

03:24.621 --> 03:26.790
Damn, I look good!

03:26.873 --> 03:28.667
Oh, that's just an artist's touch.

03:28.750 --> 03:31.628
- You're a lucky lady.
- I am. I'll see you later?

03:31.711 --> 03:33.380
- Love you so much.
- Love you.

03:34.172 --> 03:35.507
- Bye.
- Bye.

03:48.353 --> 03:50.188
Hey, look out!

03:51.481 --> 03:52.941
Oh, my God!

03:55.861 --> 03:56.862
Get help!

04:25.807 --> 04:27.559
<i>Hey, it's your sister,</i>

04:27.642 --> 04:29.311
<i>doing my daily check-in.</i>

04:29.394 --> 04:32.314
<i>How's it going today? How's Mom and Dad?</i>

04:32.397 --> 04:34.149
<i>Wanna give me a call and catch up?</i>

04:37.777 --> 04:39.404
Ma?

04:39.488 --> 04:42.657
<i>Suzy again. You know what?
You didn't call me back, but that's fine.</i>

04:42.741 --> 04:43.575
Papa?

04:43.658 --> 04:45.785
<i>What do you do
with Mom and Dad at night there?</i>

04:45.869 --> 04:46.870
<i>I'm just curious.</i>

04:46.953 --> 04:48.955
<i>Do you guys hang out
and watch </i>British Bake Off?

04:52.918 --> 04:54.961
<i>I know you're still grieving,</i>

04:55.045 --> 04:58.215
<i>but I just wanted to say
I really miss you.</i>

05:02.969 --> 05:04.804
<i>Hey, it's Suzy again.</i>

05:04.888 --> 05:08.391
<i>Like the new drawings.
Little dark, though. Don't you think?</i>

05:08.475 --> 05:11.394
<i>Maybe you should come back to the city,
to your room,</i>

05:11.478 --> 05:14.064
<i>which is empty, in our apartment?</i>

05:20.028 --> 05:21.696
<i>Mira, enough.</i>

05:21.780 --> 05:24.449
<i>You know I'm not great with words,
but John loved you.</i>

05:24.533 --> 05:27.619
<i>And I'm sure he would not wanna
see you stuck like this.</i>

05:33.166 --> 05:35.502
<i>Mom and Dad want their house back!</i>

05:35.585 --> 05:37.420
<i>Do I have to come and get you?</i>

05:43.927 --> 05:45.845
- Bye, Papa.
- Bye, beta.

05:46.596 --> 05:48.765
- Drive safely.
- I will. Bye, Mom.

05:50.892 --> 05:53.436
- Okay. I got it. Bye.
- Bye.

05:53.520 --> 05:54.437
- Bye.
- Bye.

05:54.521 --> 05:55.814
- See you, Mom.
- Bye.

05:55.897 --> 05:58.191
Tell Suzy she needs
to text her parents back.

05:58.275 --> 05:59.317
I will.

06:35.353 --> 06:36.771
She's here!

06:39.774 --> 06:42.694
I can't believe
you're still driving John's truck.

06:44.321 --> 06:46.156
It still smells like him.

06:46.239 --> 06:47.824
Oh! Come here.

06:49.284 --> 06:52.203
- No, I get the top.
- Ah!

06:53.038 --> 06:55.165
- I'm stronger than you.
- Okay.

06:55.665 --> 06:57.208
I'm really happy you're doing this.

Céline Dion?

08:05.610 --> 08:06.611
Like...

08:08.196 --> 08:11.741
Like, "My Heart Still Goes On,"
that Céline Dion?

08:11.825 --> 08:14.077
Too commercial for you, is it, huh?

08:14.160 --> 08:16.413
If you kept up
with what the kids were saying,

08:16.496 --> 08:19.582
you'd know we were
in the middle of a Célinaissance.

08:19.666 --> 08:22.836
Drake is talking about getting
a tattoo of her face.

08:22.919 --> 08:25.463
- What? How do you know that?
- Instagram.

08:25.547 --> 08:27.924
I should be starting the podcast
for the newspaper.

08:28.007 --> 08:30.218
No, what you should be doing
is leaving my office

08:30.301 --> 08:32.137
to go work on Céline Dion.

08:32.220 --> 08:33.972
Now, you seem to forget, Rob,

08:34.055 --> 08:36.683
that I've taken a big chance
hiring you, fellow Brit.

08:36.766 --> 08:39.519
But ever since you were
publicly humiliated by that woman--

08:39.602 --> 08:40.603
Elizabeth.

08:40.687 --> 08:43.273
Ever since Elizabeth dropped you
like a stone

08:43.356 --> 08:47.902
just days before your wedding,
well, your work has lacked heart.

08:48.403 --> 08:49.654
Huh.

08:49.738 --> 08:54.075
Céline Dion is all about heart. Okay?

08:54.159 --> 08:56.745
People adore her. I adore her.

08:56.828 --> 08:59.372
So get onboard,
or I'll find someone who will.

08:59.998 --> 09:04.919
- S-A-D, sad.
- Are you joking?

09:05.003 --> 09:07.464
Shut up. It was the only one I could find.

09:10.175 --> 09:13.178
It's just five. I'm gonna lose this game.

09:13.261 --> 09:14.971
Aw! Bernard wrote back.

09:15.638 --> 09:17.265
Bernard's back in the picture, huh?

09:17.348 --> 09:18.975
Mm... Not quite sure.

09:19.058 --> 09:21.686
But he wrote,
"See you soon, dot, dot, dot."

09:21.770 --> 09:24.439
With a winky smiley.
Means he wants to see me.

09:24.522 --> 09:27.650
I don't know about that.
Sounds like a blow-off to me.

09:27.734 --> 09:29.486
What? No. Winky smiley.

09:29.569 --> 09:32.906
That's, like, way more-- --like,
meaningful than, like, a regular smiley.

09:32.989 --> 09:34.449
You know what's crazy, Suzy?

09:34.532 --> 09:37.035
Our parents worked their asses off
to send us to college,

09:37.118 --> 09:39.537
and here we are,
decoding the winky in a smiley.

09:39.621 --> 09:42.916
Here you are, ladies.
Two Miras, medium rare.

09:42.999 --> 09:44.918
Wait, what is a Mira?

09:45.001 --> 09:48.421
When they put the fries inside the burger.

09:48.505 --> 09:50.882
Mo, you named a burger after me?

09:50.965 --> 09:52.008
Of course.

09:52.091 --> 09:54.552
I name burgers
after all my favorite customers.

09:54.636 --> 09:57.806
It's good to see you.
God, I missed you around here.

09:57.889 --> 09:59.682
You, not so much.

09:59.766 --> 10:01.142
How you holding up?

10:02.185 --> 10:03.561
- You know.
- Yeah.

10:04.479 --> 10:05.647
Takes a long time.

10:06.481 --> 10:09.275
Yeah. I still have a ways to go, I think.

10:09.359 --> 10:11.528
Well, you know, there's no clock.

10:11.611 --> 10:12.779
God knows, I...

10:14.197 --> 10:15.949
I still miss Roxy every day.

10:16.783 --> 10:18.451
How do you deal with it, Mo?

10:21.454 --> 10:24.666
Pour a glass of wine,
sit down for dinner,

10:25.458 --> 10:26.918
and tell her about my day.

10:27.877 --> 10:32.757
Just because she's gone doesn't mean
I can't still tell her about my feelings.

10:33.675 --> 10:36.052
The ice, it thickens.

10:37.095 --> 10:40.473
Someday, it'll support your weight.

10:40.557 --> 10:41.558
I promise.

11:11.921 --> 11:14.340
You're lucky. I love Céline.

11:16.509 --> 11:19.345
Hughes wanted to make sure
you got one of these.

11:19.846 --> 11:21.598
No. I have a phone.

11:21.681 --> 11:23.182
No, you have a personal phone.

11:23.266 --> 11:26.686
This is a work phone,
issued by our new corporate overlords.

11:26.769 --> 11:28.396
I don't wanna deal with another phone.

11:28.479 --> 11:31.316
I took the phone!
Take the phone. It's not a choice.

11:33.026 --> 11:34.027
And you?

11:34.110 --> 11:35.111
Duh.

11:37.488 --> 11:40.116
- Fine, fine.
- Yeah. Uh, be careful.

11:40.199 --> 11:45.204
There's a rumor Hughes is tracking
everything we say and do on that.

11:45.830 --> 11:47.123
- What?
- Hey.

11:47.206 --> 11:50.168
When are you going to text Jessica?

11:50.251 --> 11:53.004
I told her you would.
It's kind of rude to keep her waiting.

11:53.087 --> 11:55.423
- I told you, I'm not looking to date.
- Why not?

11:55.506 --> 11:57.175
You're, like, peaking physically.

11:57.258 --> 11:59.510
You don't wanna be out there
when you're on the decline.

11:59.594 --> 12:01.763
Yeah, she's right.
You know, just let me set you up.

12:01.846 --> 12:04.515
- You're not even on the apps anymore.
- Love isn't real. It--

12:05.767 --> 12:09.062
It's just a bunch of pheromones
that wear off.

12:09.145 --> 12:11.147
Then you get your heart ripped out,

12:11.230 --> 12:13.024
covered in bleach, stomped on,

12:13.107 --> 12:16.402
set on fire in front of your friends
and your family and...

12:18.279 --> 12:19.113
Ew.

12:19.197 --> 12:23.451
Hey, boo. Any reason you left
these things out in the truck?

12:27.747 --> 12:29.624
Well, his mom gave them to me.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.461
I just never opened it.

12:37.674 --> 12:39.676
What? Wait. No. Suzy.

12:39.759 --> 12:42.011
Come on, it's been two years.

13:03.157 --> 13:06.035
If you weren't my sister, I'd probably
be like, "Whoa, easy there, girl,"

13:06.119 --> 13:07.745
but, nah, I totally get it.

13:25.179 --> 13:26.723
<i>Orpheus and Eurydice?</i>

13:27.348 --> 13:29.851
He used to play that for me all the time,

13:29.934 --> 13:32.520
said that he'd go to hell and back for me.

13:34.981 --> 13:37.400
That's what the opera's about.

13:37.483 --> 13:40.737
Oh, God. He was the best.

14:02.091 --> 14:03.509
He never got the chance.

14:06.054 --> 14:10.850
Okay. This, I don't know,
feels a little unhealthy, maybe?

14:10.933 --> 14:11.851
What's wrong with it?

14:11.934 --> 14:14.020
I'm just wearing
my dead boyfriend's shirt

14:14.103 --> 14:16.481
and the engagement ring
he never got to give me.

14:24.113 --> 14:25.156
Come here.

14:48.429 --> 14:49.430
Okay.

14:51.349 --> 14:52.642
Okay.

14:55.019 --> 14:56.020
Um...

14:59.690 --> 15:00.691
Hey, John.

15:07.406 --> 15:09.784
This is just weird. God.

15:14.789 --> 15:16.666
<i>Leans in and he scores!</i>

15:16.749 --> 15:18.084
<i>- Knicks within two.
</i>- Yes.

15:20.169 --> 15:21.879
Hey, John...

15:29.178 --> 15:30.972
I miss you so much.

15:45.111 --> 15:47.572
<i>Over Barrett. No!</i>

15:47.655 --> 15:49.073
Yes!

15:49.157 --> 15:51.159
Come on.

16:05.089 --> 16:06.090
Yes!

16:06.757 --> 16:07.758
What?

16:08.467 --> 16:10.052
Oh-- What the hell?

16:36.120 --> 16:37.705
<i>--find Randle.</i>

16:37.788 --> 16:39.957
<i>- Randle... Oh!
</i>- <i>No!</i>

16:40.041 --> 16:41.792
<i>A heartbreaker for the Knicks tonight.</i>

16:41.876 --> 16:43.002
Come on.

16:59.977 --> 17:01.479
- Oh, sorry.
- Sorry.

17:08.027 --> 17:10.154
Interesting.

17:10.238 --> 17:13.115
Is she using the leaf to blot her tears?

17:13.199 --> 17:16.202
Well, it would be weird
to give her a tissue.

17:16.285 --> 17:17.703
Look, Mira.

17:18.371 --> 17:20.498
We make children's books here.

17:20.581 --> 17:22.333
Children. Remember them?

17:22.416 --> 17:25.753
Little people who like to look
at bright pictures and laugh.

17:25.836 --> 17:28.381
Well, maybe it's better to prepare them.

17:28.464 --> 17:31.092
That life will inevitably
crush their hopes and dreams.

17:31.175 --> 17:33.928
They tell us not to pressure creatives.

17:34.011 --> 17:37.181
But after two years, I think
I'm allowed to put a little on you.

17:37.932 --> 17:39.725
Molly, could you come in here, please?

17:42.687 --> 17:43.813
Yes, Ms. Valentine?

17:43.896 --> 17:46.023
Mira, this is Molly.

17:46.107 --> 17:47.608
- Hi.
- Big fan.

17:47.692 --> 17:50.194
Molly's a paid intern from NYU.

17:50.278 --> 17:51.779
Scholarship kid.

17:51.862 --> 17:53.447
Raised by a single mom.

17:53.531 --> 17:54.824
That's amazing.

17:54.907 --> 17:57.702
She'll lose her job
if you don't figure this out

17:57.785 --> 17:59.495
and turn in something we can publish.

18:00.871 --> 18:04.458
Oh. And I'll have to sue
for your advance as well.

18:07.169 --> 18:08.004
Thank you, Molly.

18:46.167 --> 18:47.418
Player.

18:53.674 --> 18:54.675
Hey.

18:54.759 --> 18:56.677
Lisa. Uh...

18:57.345 --> 18:58.637
Do you wanna talk?

19:00.431 --> 19:01.932
Maybe somewhere private?

19:02.975 --> 19:03.976
Okay.

19:12.318 --> 19:15.613
Look, first of all,
I want to say I'm flattered, really.

19:16.489 --> 19:20.493
It takes a lot of guts
to share your feelings with someone and...

19:20.576 --> 19:21.577
What?

19:23.913 --> 19:25.247
Hey, uh...

19:27.458 --> 19:29.293
"It's crazy to reach out like this"?

19:32.671 --> 19:34.215
"We should be together."

19:34.298 --> 19:35.758
Oh, my God. Gross.

19:35.841 --> 19:37.343
Rob, you could be, like, my dad.

19:37.426 --> 19:40.221
I'm, like, 35. I'm 35.

19:40.304 --> 19:42.056
- Ugh.
- Not much older than you are.

19:43.432 --> 19:44.433
I'm pretty cool.

19:45.142 --> 19:46.519
Yeah, whatever. I just thought--

19:46.602 --> 19:49.230
- You didn't send me a text?
- What text?

19:51.982 --> 19:55.945
No way. I don't flirt like that.
I'm, like, good at it.

19:56.028 --> 19:57.530
I think they're nice.

19:58.447 --> 19:59.281
Oh!

20:02.118 --> 20:03.577
Whoa, that's super sad.

20:04.620 --> 20:06.414
Who is sending me these texts?

20:06.497 --> 20:08.416
Someone's smishing you.

20:09.125 --> 20:10.501
Phishing, but by text.

20:10.584 --> 20:13.754
First, they lure you in,
then they ask for your credit card number.

20:15.714 --> 20:17.007
- Delete it.
- Yeah.

20:39.530 --> 20:43.909
Céline, you're arguably more popular today
than when you started.

20:43.993 --> 20:46.996
How do you think you've managed
to stay relevant for so long?

20:47.079 --> 20:49.081
Hm. What a question.

20:49.165 --> 20:51.167
Do you ever stop and ask yourself

20:51.250 --> 20:55.254
why people continue to read your work
as a middle-aged male journalist?

20:56.172 --> 21:00.676
Maybe it's because if the work is good,
it's timeless. Yeah?

21:00.759 --> 21:04.847
Miss Dion, it's been over a decade
since you've toured in the States.

21:04.930 --> 21:06.265
I'm curious. Why now?

21:06.348 --> 21:08.893
For five years, it's been tough.

21:08.976 --> 21:11.604
Raising my children
after the loss of their father,

21:11.687 --> 21:14.523
the love of my life, my husband, Réne.

21:14.607 --> 21:16.567
And at the same time,

21:16.650 --> 21:19.361
I didn't want to just sit around
and be sad.

21:19.445 --> 21:23.657
So I decided to hit the road
and do what I love.

21:23.741 --> 21:24.617
Tell me about it.

21:24.700 --> 21:25.743
What was that?

21:26.327 --> 21:29.371
Nothing. Just--
I was responding to a text.

21:29.455 --> 21:30.998
- Sorry.
- Oh. Cool.

21:31.081 --> 21:33.125
Feel free to talk with friends
if I'm boring you.

21:33.209 --> 21:35.252
No, no, no, it wasn't-- I mean...

21:36.086 --> 21:37.505
I wouldn't say it was a friend.

21:42.468 --> 21:43.969
Do you have a question for me?

21:44.053 --> 21:44.887
Um...

21:45.888 --> 21:48.849
Yes. Yeah, yeah. Sure.

21:48.933 --> 21:49.934
Um...

21:51.519 --> 21:52.353
Miss Dion...

21:52.436 --> 21:55.773
Céline, you sing a lot about love,
obviously.

21:55.856 --> 21:57.858
For example,
in "That's the Way It Is," you say:

21:57.942 --> 22:00.319
"When you're ready to go
and your heart's left in doubt,

22:00.402 --> 22:03.572
don't give up on your faith,
love comes to those that believe it."

22:03.656 --> 22:06.242
But in "When I Fall in Love,"

22:06.325 --> 22:09.662
you say, "In a restless world like this,
love is ended...

22:10.788 --> 22:12.248
before it's begun."

22:13.290 --> 22:14.708
What's the question?

22:16.252 --> 22:18.629
Well, do you really believe
in all these things you sing?

22:20.965 --> 22:23.801
You obviously know nothing about it.

22:25.135 --> 22:26.136
What?

22:26.220 --> 22:27.346
Love.

22:30.391 --> 22:33.519
Céline, are you taking your children
on tour with you?

22:41.819 --> 22:43.070
Who are you texting?

22:44.572 --> 22:45.781
No one.

22:45.864 --> 22:48.784
This the same "no one"
that you were texting last night?

22:48.867 --> 22:50.160
Yes, actually.

22:50.244 --> 22:53.289
But trust me,
it's totally not what you think.

22:53.372 --> 22:54.957
Mira, there is nothing wrong

22:55.040 --> 22:56.834
with putting yourself
back out there again.

22:56.917 --> 23:00.004
Oh, my God, stop, please,
I wouldn't even know where to start.

23:00.087 --> 23:01.338
Oh, oh, oh!

23:01.422 --> 23:03.340
Well, it's kind of amazing
that you say that

23:03.424 --> 23:06.093
because your sister, who loves you,

23:06.176 --> 23:08.220
who's kind of awesome and got your back,

23:08.304 --> 23:10.848
might have already started you on an app.

23:10.931 --> 23:12.474
Sorry, what?

23:12.558 --> 23:14.310
- I hate apps!
- I know. I know.

23:14.393 --> 23:15.603
They're the worst. But...

23:16.353 --> 23:19.398
you're kind of beautiful, and young,
and you have your whole life ahead of you.

23:19.481 --> 23:21.859
You're not allowed to give up on dating.

23:21.942 --> 23:23.193
So just take a look.

23:24.153 --> 23:27.573
What? No, no. I'm not ready for this.

23:30.909 --> 23:32.786
Okay, why is every guy shirtless?

23:32.870 --> 23:34.955
I wouldn't talk to any one of these guys.

23:35.039 --> 23:37.416
But you don't have to worry
because it's Bumble.

23:37.499 --> 23:39.043
So the woman makes the first move.

23:40.210 --> 23:42.212
What? What do you think?

23:43.464 --> 23:45.758
No? What about this guy?

23:45.841 --> 23:47.968
Okay. So we do a little right swipe.

23:48.052 --> 23:50.471
- I didn't tell you to swipe.
- Wait. Stop.

23:50.554 --> 23:53.557
It's a match on your first one.
Who even are you?

23:53.641 --> 23:54.642
Oh.

23:54.725 --> 23:56.352
Come on, that is such a sign.

23:56.435 --> 23:58.520
So we just do a little "hey"

23:58.604 --> 24:00.147
- to see what he--
- Don't text him.

24:00.230 --> 24:01.231
- Stop.
- You texted him?

24:01.315 --> 24:03.942
Yes. Oh, my God, he's texting back.

24:05.444 --> 24:06.945
"Nice pic." Mm.

24:08.197 --> 24:09.948
- "Do you wanna go for a drink?"
- No.

24:10.032 --> 24:11.617
- Yes. It's amazing!
- No.

24:11.700 --> 24:14.078
Look, just do it for me, your sister,

24:14.161 --> 24:15.454
who loves you so, so, so much.

24:15.537 --> 24:17.956
- Your happiness is my happiness.
- Shut up.

24:18.707 --> 24:20.000
- One drink.
- You're gonna go?

24:20.084 --> 24:21.710
- If you shut up.
- I promise.

24:21.794 --> 24:23.504
- One drink. Whoo!
- Wow.

24:24.213 --> 24:26.090
- So aggressive.
- I know.

24:27.675 --> 24:29.051
<i>♪ Wherever you go ♪</i>

24:29.134 --> 24:30.260
<i>♪ Oh ♪</i>

24:30.344 --> 24:32.930

24:34.139 --> 24:36.642

24:36.725 --> 24:37.893

24:37.976 --> 24:39.311

24:39.395 --> 24:40.813
- Hi, Rob.
- Oh.

24:40.896 --> 24:43.899
You're checking that phone a lot.
You still getting those depressing texts?

24:43.982 --> 24:45.234
- What?
- Lisa told me.

24:45.317 --> 24:47.778
You know what? I don't think
it sounds like a scammer at all.

24:47.861 --> 24:48.737
- Really?
- Mm-mm.

24:48.821 --> 24:51.240
It sounds more like a psychotic stalker.

24:51.323 --> 24:53.992
Or just a really confused old lady.

24:54.702 --> 24:56.870
Don't believe me? Text them back.

24:56.954 --> 24:59.248
I couldn't do that. They're too personal.

24:59.331 --> 25:00.999
Wouldn't want to embarrass
whoever this was.

25:01.083 --> 25:03.127
Mm-hm. Oh! Oh!

25:03.210 --> 25:05.921
Has psychotic grandma sent another one?

25:07.256 --> 25:11.009
"Guess who's going
to that awful hipster bar Rendez tonight?

25:11.093 --> 25:13.345
Please don't judge,
I already feel so guilty.

25:13.429 --> 25:14.680
And I'm definitely not ready.

25:14.763 --> 25:17.015
But I guess if I don't force myself,
I'll never be."

25:17.099 --> 25:19.643
That is a great bar. I know that.
That's a good pick-up spot.

25:19.727 --> 25:21.687
- I'm going.
- What? Where?

25:21.770 --> 25:22.771
Why?

25:23.856 --> 25:25.357
You're going now? Why?

25:26.066 --> 25:28.068
You're always telling me
to get back out there.

25:28.152 --> 25:29.987
Yeah, no, this is true,

25:30.070 --> 25:32.656
but these are texts
from a literal stranger.

25:32.740 --> 25:34.950
Yeah, but they speak to me.

25:35.033 --> 25:36.160
They speak to you?

25:36.243 --> 25:39.705
No. What are you doing, Rob?
You sound like an insane person right now.

25:39.788 --> 25:43.333
Look, I just need
to put a face to these texts, okay?

25:45.544 --> 25:46.587
That's all.

25:49.506 --> 25:51.133
You're gonna go with him, right?

25:53.594 --> 25:56.180
Yeah, right, okay. Thanks.

25:57.222 --> 25:58.974
Do you think this is healthy?

25:59.057 --> 26:01.643
How are you gonna know
if it's even them or not?

26:01.727 --> 26:02.853
I have no idea.

26:03.645 --> 26:05.272
- You got this.
- Cool plan.

26:05.355 --> 26:07.274
You've got it. You look gorgeous.

26:07.357 --> 26:09.234
- I'm feeling you.
- I don't know if I can do it.

26:09.318 --> 26:11.320
- You can, it's just a drink.
- Suzy.

26:11.403 --> 26:14.156
Come on. No, no, no.
You go in there, okay?

26:14.239 --> 26:17.159
He's a dud, you text me, I'll call you,

26:17.242 --> 26:19.787
we'll just say there's a family emergency.
No problem.

26:19.870 --> 26:22.039
- Keep your phone on. The whole time.
- Swear to God.

26:22.122 --> 26:23.582
All night. Pinky swear.

26:23.665 --> 26:26.585
- I got it. Okay. I'll do it.
- Ah, ah, ah.

26:27.586 --> 26:28.587
Mira.

26:30.380 --> 26:31.381
I know.

26:32.883 --> 26:36.261
Hey. Listen, you know I loved John
like a brother, right?

26:37.679 --> 26:41.183
Okay, so I'm saying this
with the hugest amount of love

26:41.266 --> 26:42.976
and the greatest amount of respect.

26:43.060 --> 26:45.395
This guy tonight doesn't have
to be your soulmate.

26:45.479 --> 26:47.272
You don't even have to like him.

26:47.356 --> 26:48.649
If the body's good,

26:48.732 --> 26:50.651
you go in there, you get the D.

26:50.734 --> 26:52.903
There's not gonna be any getting of any D.

26:52.986 --> 26:54.112
Trust me, you need the D.

26:54.196 --> 26:56.031
You make it sound
like a vitamin deficiency.

26:56.114 --> 27:00.118
Yeah, you do. Vitamin D deficiency.
Come on, go get in there.

27:00.202 --> 27:02.412
Hey, none of those
"Would you rather" questions.

27:02.496 --> 27:04.915
- I know you.
- Everyone loves my questions.

27:04.998 --> 27:07.251
Nobody loves your questions.

27:07.334 --> 27:09.294
Come on. You got this. You got this!

27:09.378 --> 27:10.546
- Okay, okay.
- Whoo!

27:11.255 --> 27:14.132
Mira's got it. She's looking fly. Whoo!

27:14.216 --> 27:15.384
Yeah, okay.

27:18.053 --> 27:19.096
Oh, gross.

27:20.138 --> 27:23.016
This shit is like the musical equivalent
of Cheez Whiz.

27:23.100 --> 27:26.645
Uh, Rob, check out that guy there.
Don't look, but look.

27:26.728 --> 27:27.729
Don't...

27:29.314 --> 27:30.357
- Yeah?
- What do you mean?

27:30.440 --> 27:33.569
Maybe he is your, uh, texter.

27:33.652 --> 27:35.737
I thought you said
they were from some psycho granny?

27:35.821 --> 27:37.114
Or a sensitive silver fox.

27:37.197 --> 27:38.615
He has super kind eyes.

27:38.699 --> 27:41.952
- Would you like to go talk to him?
- Why would you insult me, Rob?

27:42.035 --> 27:44.329
I'm here for you, buddy. Nobody else.

27:44.413 --> 27:46.665
How could you say that to me, Rob?

27:53.422 --> 27:54.423
What?

28:00.137 --> 28:01.430
Wait, wait.

28:02.055 --> 28:04.016
- I think I've seen her before.
- Okay, cool.

28:18.405 --> 28:20.198
- Mira.
- Yes. Hi.

28:20.282 --> 28:21.199
Hi.

28:21.283 --> 28:22.367
Please.

28:27.873 --> 28:29.583
Another skinny marg.

28:31.335 --> 28:34.087
Everyone thinks personal training
is all about the body.

28:34.171 --> 28:39.217
But you can't do 400 weighted squats...

28:39.760 --> 28:40.928
without a brain.

28:42.179 --> 28:43.221
Well...

28:43.305 --> 28:46.058
You really can't do anything
without a brain.

28:46.850 --> 28:47.851
You get it.

28:51.855 --> 28:54.107
Two Ketel One martinis.

28:54.191 --> 28:57.027
Compliments of the gentleman over there.

28:57.110 --> 28:58.153
Oh.

28:58.737 --> 29:00.280
Would you just go talk to him already?

29:00.364 --> 29:01.949
Rob, stop!

29:03.867 --> 29:05.744
I will be two minutes.

29:09.247 --> 29:10.332
I like this song.

29:13.210 --> 29:14.628
Tight bassline.

29:14.711 --> 29:15.921
Sorry, one second.

29:24.179 --> 29:27.432
- All good over there?
- Gonna put my phone on silent.

29:30.519 --> 29:32.354
- I have a question for you.
- Hm?

29:33.021 --> 29:36.358
Would you rather live
your entire life with...

29:37.275 --> 29:40.737
silent but uncontrollable gas,

29:40.821 --> 29:45.117
or loud, uncontrollable sneezes?

29:46.326 --> 29:47.411
Neither.

29:47.494 --> 29:50.122
Just pick one. Or you get both.

29:50.205 --> 29:51.206
Stop it.

29:52.791 --> 29:54.209
It's too much pressure.

29:55.961 --> 29:58.296
I have his number.

29:58.380 --> 30:00.048
- Uh, unlock your phone.
- Oh.

30:00.132 --> 30:04.553
Let's just check into the numbers
and make sure this guy is not your texter.

30:04.636 --> 30:06.179
And it is not.

30:06.263 --> 30:08.682
Praise be, because we are
totally gonna smash later.

30:09.266 --> 30:10.350
- Good.
- Yeah.

30:10.434 --> 30:12.060
- The boys' room.
- Yeah.

30:14.021 --> 30:15.522
Oh, my...

30:23.864 --> 30:25.115
- Wait.
- Mm-hm.

30:29.202 --> 30:30.704
- It think it might be her.
- Oh, really?

30:30.787 --> 30:32.330
- Because she's on her phone?
- Yeah.

30:32.414 --> 30:34.249
He's texting. The barperson's texting.

30:34.332 --> 30:36.501
Could be anybody.
Why do you think it's her?

30:36.585 --> 30:37.419
Huh.

30:38.420 --> 30:41.006
Does that guy look like
he does too many push-ups?

30:41.089 --> 30:44.593
No, that's not too many push-ups.
It's the perfect amount of push-ups.

30:44.676 --> 30:47.012
She's not having a good time with him.

30:47.721 --> 30:49.181
No, no, no, she is not.

30:49.264 --> 30:51.933
She is so miserable
and so lucky you're here.

30:52.017 --> 30:52.851
Oh!

30:53.351 --> 30:54.978
They're leaving.

30:56.104 --> 30:57.606
I bet I could bench-press you.

31:05.989 --> 31:07.199
You know what, Rob?

31:08.241 --> 31:09.367
Uh...

31:09.451 --> 31:12.120
This night is not a total loss, you know?

31:12.204 --> 31:13.288
Because...

31:14.456 --> 31:15.665
I'm gonna get laid.

31:25.383 --> 31:28.261
Maybe we just take it a little slower?

31:28.804 --> 31:30.138
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

31:30.222 --> 31:32.265
- Sure. No problem.
- Okay. Okay.

31:32.349 --> 31:34.851
<i>♪ That's my one-track mind ♪</i>

31:34.935 --> 31:37.104
<i>♪ You are my real love</i>

31:37.187 --> 31:39.606

31:39.689 --> 31:41.608

31:41.691 --> 31:43.735
What are you doing?

31:44.569 --> 31:45.612
I'm going slower.

31:46.154 --> 31:47.948
Well, that's not what I meant.

31:49.199 --> 31:51.159
Wait, are we not gonna have sex
at your place?

31:51.243 --> 31:54.246
No! When did I say that?

31:54.329 --> 31:56.498
Did I give you mixed signals or something?

31:56.581 --> 31:59.835
No, it's fine.
I just wish you would've told me sooner.

32:00.544 --> 32:01.378
Okay.

32:01.461 --> 32:03.964
Are you looking
for another date right now?

32:04.047 --> 32:05.966
Um, yeah. Yeah.

32:06.049 --> 32:09.636
Because you don't want to have sex
and I have to burn off these calories.

32:09.719 --> 32:13.014
- Those drinks had a lot of carbs.
- You know what? Get out.

32:13.098 --> 32:15.851
- Get out. Now, now, now.
- Okay. Okay.

32:15.934 --> 32:19.020
Take a fucking run.
It'll burn off those carbs!

33:01.563 --> 33:02.814
I miss it too.

33:04.107 --> 33:06.026
- Ready?
- Yeah.

33:06.109 --> 33:07.110
Let's go.

33:11.907 --> 33:14.075
Rob Burns, <i>New York Chronicle.
</i>Nice to meet you.

33:14.159 --> 33:15.952
Yeah. The rude texter.

33:19.039 --> 33:20.165
That's me.

33:21.791 --> 33:23.251
Let me see your hands.

33:24.920 --> 33:25.921
- These?
- Please.

33:26.004 --> 33:28.924
Come over and give me your hands.

33:37.307 --> 33:38.141
Hm.

33:39.017 --> 33:42.437
Strange. You have very manly hands.

33:43.230 --> 33:45.857
- And yet, you act like a little boy.
- What?

33:46.983 --> 33:49.653
- I don't act like a little boy.
- Let me ask you a question.

33:49.736 --> 33:52.864
- And I want you to be totally honest.
- Okay.

33:53.698 --> 33:55.283
Are you a fan of my music?

33:57.327 --> 33:58.912
- Yes.
- Liar.

33:58.995 --> 34:01.331
- Why do you say that?
- You don't even know how to hear it.

34:01.414 --> 34:03.083
No offense...

34:04.042 --> 34:04.876
Céline.

34:04.960 --> 34:07.671
I think I can grasp lyrics like, um...

34:08.255 --> 34:10.966
"If I hear you breathe,
I get wings to fly."

34:11.841 --> 34:14.219
Has anyone ever made you feel like that?

34:16.221 --> 34:19.766
Have you ever made someone else
feel like that?

34:22.811 --> 34:24.145
You have, haven't you?

34:25.563 --> 34:26.564
I see it.

34:27.107 --> 34:28.149
I thought so.

34:29.818 --> 34:31.194
A while back, but...

34:34.364 --> 34:35.532
It didn't work out.

34:36.491 --> 34:37.993
And you've been stuck ever since?

34:38.660 --> 34:39.744
How'd you know that?

34:41.830 --> 34:44.332
Because you have the presence
of a pair of used underwear.

34:48.962 --> 34:51.464
Sit up straight. Sit up straight.

34:51.548 --> 34:54.009
Come on, man, you're with Céline Dion!

34:54.092 --> 34:55.719
- Okay.
- Okay, Mr. Underwear.

34:56.344 --> 34:58.388
Do you have someone
in your life right now?

35:00.056 --> 35:00.890
I...

35:04.144 --> 35:06.813
I think I might have feelings
for someone I've never met.

35:06.896 --> 35:09.649
You are more interesting
than you look. Go on.

35:48.772 --> 35:49.773
Oh, shit.

36:12.170 --> 36:14.839
I feel like I got to know her
through these texts.

36:16.674 --> 36:18.593
You know, maybe I'm just fooling myself.

36:18.676 --> 36:20.929
These texts you're receiving
are saying something.

36:21.012 --> 36:23.348
Things like this don't just happen.

36:24.224 --> 36:25.642
You need to pursue this.

36:25.725 --> 36:26.726
Really?

36:27.769 --> 36:30.772
You don't think it's crazy
to fall for someone like this?

36:30.855 --> 36:34.359
Oh, it might be crazy.
But love doesn't always follow the rules.

36:34.442 --> 36:36.611
Take my situation, for example.

36:37.237 --> 36:39.739
René had always been my manager
my entire career.

36:39.823 --> 36:42.742
But I never thought of him in that way...

36:43.451 --> 36:45.203
until one night in Dublin.

36:47.288 --> 36:48.790
What happened in Dublin?

36:49.290 --> 36:51.668
We were there
for the Eurovision song contest,

36:51.751 --> 36:53.837
and it was the night before finals.

36:54.337 --> 36:57.674
I was about to go up to my hotel room
and get a good night's sleep.

36:57.757 --> 37:01.302
And René wished me good night
and gave me a kiss on each cheek,

37:01.386 --> 37:02.720
like he always did.

37:05.306 --> 37:09.686
But on that night,
he stopped ever so briefly at my lips...

37:10.895 --> 37:14.649
and gave me the softest,
sweetest little peck.

37:16.276 --> 37:17.652
And at that moment...

37:18.403 --> 37:20.864
that kiss on the lips
was the answer to everything

37:20.947 --> 37:24.033
that I was feeling deep down inside of me.

37:25.034 --> 37:29.205
It was as if that kiss had unlocked
a secret that had been in our hearts.

37:31.291 --> 37:32.459
I was his.

37:34.544 --> 37:35.753
And he was mine.

37:38.506 --> 37:42.260
Love has a plan
for each and every one of us.

37:43.178 --> 37:45.597
I think these texts
are part of the plan for you.

37:49.225 --> 37:50.268
Time's up.

37:50.351 --> 37:51.769
Oh. Um...

37:52.854 --> 37:54.230
We didn't get to the interview.

37:54.314 --> 37:57.025
Come back to me as a man
and we can try again.

37:57.108 --> 37:59.652
- Yeah, I'm 35.
- Then you still have time.

38:00.445 --> 38:01.946
Love takes courage.

38:02.030 --> 38:05.992
Open yourself to the universe
and it'll come rushing in, Rob Burns.

38:06.075 --> 38:07.076
Okay.

38:32.560 --> 38:33.561
No.

40:22.754 --> 40:23.838
- Billy, give it back.
- No.

40:23.921 --> 40:26.549
You need to get over this.
This is not healthy.

40:29.177 --> 40:30.511
Just give it to me.

40:32.889 --> 40:34.641
- Billy.
- No, no.

40:34.724 --> 40:37.143
- Give me the phone.
- No. Don't follow me.

40:37.226 --> 40:38.144
I won't chase you.

40:38.227 --> 40:40.104
- Give me the phone!
- Help me, Lisa!

40:40.188 --> 40:41.522
No, Lisa, call HR.

40:41.606 --> 40:43.691
- Give it to me!
- No! Just calm down, okay?

40:43.775 --> 40:45.401
Just calm down. Just breathe, okay?

40:45.485 --> 40:48.780
Because you don't even know
if this is from her. Okay?

40:51.199 --> 40:53.201
Okay, it's from her. Just wait there.

40:59.374 --> 41:00.750
This makes no sense.

41:08.132 --> 41:10.510
"Here, where never is heard
a discouraging word,

41:11.094 --> 41:13.262
is nothing but joy and desire."

41:15.348 --> 41:17.266
It's from <i>Orpheus and Eurydice.</i>

41:18.309 --> 41:21.479
The opera? By Gluck?
It's playing at the Manhattan Opera House.

41:21.562 --> 41:24.607
- Sorry. You listen to "opera" now?
- You don't know my life.

41:25.858 --> 41:27.193
Enlighten me, please.

41:28.319 --> 41:31.072
Orpheus travels to Hades
to get back his dead wife.

41:31.155 --> 41:33.491
And he's given permission
to return to Earth with her,

41:33.574 --> 41:36.411
under the condition
that he not look at her face

41:36.494 --> 41:37.829
until they're outta Hades.

41:37.912 --> 41:40.623
- Why?
- I don't know. 'Cause the gods are dicks.

41:40.707 --> 41:44.168
Anyway, Orpheus can't resist
but look at Eurydice's face

41:44.252 --> 41:48.089
because people are weak
and love makes fools out of everyone.

41:48.172 --> 41:50.508
So he ends up losing her. All over again.

41:51.467 --> 41:52.802
I'm gonna go see it.

41:53.553 --> 41:57.390
- Why?
- Obviously, it has meaning for her.

41:58.015 --> 42:00.810
Oh, okay. Uh...
How do you know if she's even going?

42:00.893 --> 42:03.062
And if she does,
you still won't know when.

42:04.272 --> 42:06.023
I'll just keep going until she shows up.

42:06.107 --> 42:07.108
Oh-ho.

42:07.191 --> 42:08.651
You'll just keep going?

42:09.318 --> 42:12.071
That is... That is so crazy.

42:14.407 --> 42:15.408
Yeah.

42:16.492 --> 42:17.869
Yeah, but like she said...

42:19.579 --> 42:21.372
love makes fools of everyone.

44:17.989 --> 44:18.990
Do I know you?

44:19.991 --> 44:20.825
I...

44:23.244 --> 44:24.328
I'm not sure.

44:25.496 --> 44:28.416
- I'm sorry.
- I mean, everyone starts as strangers.

44:29.292 --> 44:31.168
I don't know a lot of people.

44:31.961 --> 44:34.380
- Okay.
- We both like comfortable footwear.

44:34.463 --> 44:36.549
Um... Oh!

44:37.341 --> 44:40.303
Jordan 1s, I see.
I'm more of an 11s kinda girl.

44:41.304 --> 44:44.056
That's cool, I have thems-- Those...

44:44.932 --> 44:46.559
sneakers. I have sneakers at home.

44:46.642 --> 44:49.896
Nice. I didn't wear mine
'cause they didn't go with this dress.

44:49.979 --> 44:50.980
No.

44:54.400 --> 44:58.154
- Did you, um... Did you like the show?
- Yes.

44:58.237 --> 44:59.906
- Very much so, actually.
- Huh.

44:59.989 --> 45:00.823
And you?

45:01.908 --> 45:04.076
Yeah. Yeah, I thought it was so...

45:05.995 --> 45:07.121
hopeful.

45:07.204 --> 45:08.623
Hopeful?

45:09.123 --> 45:10.458
- Really?
- Yeah.

45:10.541 --> 45:14.545
Sure, there's a lot of pain and suffering,
but, ultimately, love wins in the end.

45:14.629 --> 45:17.590
There's no joy without the struggle,
they go hand in hand.

45:18.841 --> 45:21.135
Just have faith. Keep looking forward.

45:22.929 --> 45:25.181
At least, that's what I saw.

45:25.264 --> 45:26.682
That's so strange.

45:27.475 --> 45:30.436
I've seen the show so many times
and I never saw it like that.

45:31.103 --> 45:33.606
I guess it's about how you hear the music.

45:34.732 --> 45:36.025
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

45:37.652 --> 45:39.320
Would you like my number?

45:40.404 --> 45:43.699
If you wanna talk more about the show,
or other Jordans.

45:44.283 --> 45:45.159
Um...

45:45.785 --> 45:47.787
- Okay, sure.
- Cool.

45:52.041 --> 45:54.085
I'm Rob. Rob Burns.

45:54.794 --> 45:57.213
Hi, Rob Burns. I'm Mira Ray.

45:58.839 --> 46:00.091
- Hi.
- Hi.

46:03.594 --> 46:07.014
- That's my personal number.
- Oh. How many other numbers do you have?

46:07.098 --> 46:10.226
You know, just one. For work.

46:10.351 --> 46:11.769
Okay.

46:11.852 --> 46:16.440
- Of course.
- I guess we're not strangers anymore.

46:18.651 --> 46:19.777
I guess not.

46:23.280 --> 46:24.281
Oh! Oh.

46:25.157 --> 46:28.369
- I'm so sorry.
- Don't worry about it. It's nothing.

47:13.539 --> 47:14.540
Children's books.

47:17.460 --> 47:18.461
Cool.

48:08.052 --> 48:09.553
We talked.

48:09.637 --> 48:11.388
- Last night. At the opera.
- Ah.

48:11.472 --> 48:14.391
Well, there we go!

48:14.475 --> 48:16.560
- Okay.
- Shut up!

48:16.644 --> 48:19.146
I know, right?
And it's true. And get this.

48:19.230 --> 48:20.356
She thinks...

48:22.525 --> 48:24.110
- I am interesting.
- Ooh.

48:24.193 --> 48:26.445
Really? How do we know this information?

48:26.529 --> 48:28.989
Oh. She texted her
dead boyfriend about me.

48:29.073 --> 48:31.408
- I found his Facebook profile.
- What?

48:33.744 --> 48:36.872
Yeah. He's who she's been texting
this whole time.

48:36.956 --> 48:39.208
I must have the dead boyfriend's number.

48:39.291 --> 48:42.419
Yikes. That's not good.

48:44.505 --> 48:47.341
Oh, my God, it's her.
She's calling me right now.

48:55.015 --> 48:57.017
- He's not picking up.
- Leave a message.

48:57.101 --> 48:59.603
- What do I do? What do I do?
- Answer the phone, Rob.

48:59.687 --> 49:02.731
- Answer the phone! Now!
- Pick up the phone.

49:02.815 --> 49:05.401
- Rob, come on. This is unbearable.
- Answer the phone.

49:06.318 --> 49:07.153
Yo!

49:10.406 --> 49:11.240
Um...

49:11.323 --> 49:15.035
Hi. Hi. This is Mira Ray.

49:15.119 --> 49:16.787
<i>From the opera last night.</i>

49:16.871 --> 49:19.039
Oh. Yeah, hey. Hey!

49:20.916 --> 49:24.503
- How the heck are ya?
- I'm good. Um...

49:24.587 --> 49:26.714
How are you? I hope this isn't a bad time.

49:26.797 --> 49:32.094
No. No, no, no. I'm just at work.
No. But you're not interrupting anything.

49:32.178 --> 49:35.055
I work to live,
you know, not live to work.

49:36.098 --> 49:38.726
<i>I'm a music critic at the</i> Chronicle.

49:38.809 --> 49:41.061
Oh, that's cool.
He's a music critic.

49:41.145 --> 49:42.521
<i>Nice weather we're having.</i>

49:43.480 --> 49:47.443
I love a crisp winter's day
in New York City.

49:47.526 --> 49:50.863
<i>Um... Yeah. I love the weather.</i>

49:50.946 --> 49:54.450
<i>- It's been very weather-y?
</i>-

49:55.117 --> 49:57.578
Hey, I was wondering, do you eat?

49:58.287 --> 49:59.455
He just asked me if I eat.

50:00.706 --> 50:03.626
I mean, I know you eat.
At least, I assume you do.

50:03.709 --> 50:05.544
But some people,
they're just not into food.

50:05.628 --> 50:08.088
They do it because they have to.
Otherwise, they would die.

50:08.172 --> 50:10.341
<i>But I-- I love food.</i>

50:10.424 --> 50:12.635
I can't get enough.
Unless, of course, I'm full.

50:12.718 --> 50:15.221
And then I'm like, "No, I'm all set here."

50:18.641 --> 50:21.977
Yeah, so, specifically,
I was wondering, would you like to eat?

50:22.061 --> 50:23.062
With me?

50:26.857 --> 50:28.025
Tonight.

50:28.108 --> 50:32.738
Uh... Yeah.
I mean, I love food too.

50:34.531 --> 50:36.075
Do you like cheeseburgers?

50:36.158 --> 50:40.663
Are you kidding? Cheeseburgers.
I love cheeseburgers.

50:40.746 --> 50:45.417
Um, I know this cute little spot
called Roxy's. Um...

50:46.502 --> 50:49.380
Do you want to meet there,
say, like, 7 tonight?

50:49.463 --> 50:50.589
Yeah.

50:51.423 --> 50:54.301
That's perfect. That's 7,
that's my favorite time to meet.

50:56.053 --> 50:58.264
- Okay.
<i>- Well, I'll see you.</i>

50:58.347 --> 50:59.348
Well, see ya.

51:01.642 --> 51:03.310
Wow, I have no words.

51:06.438 --> 51:08.732
Oh, my God. Congratulations.

51:08.816 --> 51:12.069
You just got yourself a date
the normal way. No apps.

51:12.152 --> 51:14.321
We're meeting for cheeseburgers at 7:00.

51:14.405 --> 51:15.823
That's in, like, 45 minutes.

51:15.906 --> 51:18.284
Perfect. Now you can tell her
about the texts in person.

51:18.367 --> 51:20.661
But if I do that,
she'll never speak to me again.

51:21.870 --> 51:23.622
- The truth hurts.
- Rob.

51:23.706 --> 51:25.874
May I see you in my office, please?

51:27.584 --> 51:29.420
Actually, sir, I'm kinda busy.

51:30.129 --> 51:32.298
Rhetorical question. Now!

51:39.305 --> 51:41.807
How is the Céline Dion piece coming along?

51:41.890 --> 51:43.559
Good. Really good.

51:44.184 --> 51:45.686
Anything for me to read?

51:47.438 --> 51:49.898
Uh, not yet, but soon.

51:49.982 --> 51:52.234
Okay, well, that's funny
because I've been noticing

51:52.318 --> 51:55.571
quite a few interesting texts
on your work phone.

51:55.654 --> 51:56.739
What?

51:59.783 --> 52:01.827
I don't even know where to begin.

52:02.411 --> 52:04.163
"My heart is broken.

52:04.246 --> 52:07.291
There's also this aching inside of me."

52:08.792 --> 52:11.086
Doesn't sound very work-related to me.

52:11.170 --> 52:12.796
Those are, um...

52:15.215 --> 52:16.216
song lyrics.

52:18.469 --> 52:20.346
From Céline Dion.

52:22.931 --> 52:23.766
Wow.

52:26.268 --> 52:30.147
Sounds like you've made a connection,
if she's sending you lyrics.

52:30.230 --> 52:31.273
Yeah.

52:31.357 --> 52:32.691
Wow!

52:32.775 --> 52:36.945
- I'm holding Céline's lyrics in my hand.
- Yeah, you are.

52:37.029 --> 52:39.448
You know, my wife and I danced
to "Have You Ever Been in Love"

52:39.531 --> 52:40.366
at our wedding.

52:41.283 --> 52:43.285
That's a deep cut, sir.
I did not know that.

52:45.454 --> 52:48.874

52:50.209 --> 52:52.795

53:17.194 --> 53:20.030
No, you're fine. I'm glad you made it.

53:20.114 --> 53:21.115
Yeah.

53:21.949 --> 53:22.783
Um...

53:23.867 --> 53:25.577
Um, yeah.

53:27.079 --> 53:28.247
Um...

53:28.330 --> 53:29.581
Nice sneakers.

53:29.665 --> 53:31.041
Oh, I wore them for you.

53:31.125 --> 53:32.292
I'm honored.

53:32.376 --> 53:33.544
The low-top 1s.

53:34.336 --> 53:35.587
Nice choice.

53:35.671 --> 53:37.714
Yeah, thanks.

53:39.258 --> 53:40.968
- So were you wait--?
- Was it okay to--?

53:42.636 --> 53:46.140
- Did it take you long in--?
- You go ahead. Please. Sorry.

53:48.350 --> 53:50.018
- Go ahead.
- I just wanted to say that...

53:51.728 --> 53:53.397
I was looking forward to this.

53:55.607 --> 54:00.654
I just felt like last night at the opera,
I knew you or something.

54:01.280 --> 54:02.739
No, I, uh...

54:04.241 --> 54:06.577
Yeah, I've been...

54:06.660 --> 54:07.661
I, um...

54:08.328 --> 54:09.163
Wi--

54:09.955 --> 54:11.748
Will you excuse me a moment?

54:11.832 --> 54:13.250
- You okay?
- Yeah.

54:17.004 --> 54:19.339
This is not the right time to tell her.

54:20.132 --> 54:22.593
Soon. But not now.

54:24.136 --> 54:25.471
You are fine.

54:27.097 --> 54:28.098
Yeah.

54:42.029 --> 54:43.071
You okay?

54:44.198 --> 54:45.741
- Yes.
- Okay.

54:47.117 --> 54:48.452
This looks amazing.

54:48.535 --> 54:51.121
Sorry, I took the liberty.
It's the best in the city.

54:51.747 --> 54:53.582
- Should we do it?
- Yeah, let's go.

54:54.958 --> 54:56.084
Oh, my God.

54:56.168 --> 54:57.711
- No way.
- What?

54:57.794 --> 54:58.837
Do you always do that?

55:00.172 --> 55:02.090
- What?
- Put fries in your burger?

55:02.799 --> 55:03.800
Yeah.

55:05.344 --> 55:06.929
No, it's just, it's the best way.

55:07.012 --> 55:08.597
- It is, right?
- It is.

55:08.680 --> 55:09.806
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

55:13.644 --> 55:14.645
Mmm.

55:15.646 --> 55:17.356
- I have another question for you.
- Mm?

55:17.439 --> 55:18.565
- Mm-hm.
- Mm-hm?

55:19.608 --> 55:22.528
Would you rather own ten cats

55:22.611 --> 55:25.280
or have a parrot on your shoulder
for 22 hours a day?

55:27.699 --> 55:29.076
What kind of question is that?

55:31.954 --> 55:34.081
I was...

55:34.164 --> 55:35.165
A bird.

55:35.749 --> 55:37.251
Wins hands down every time.

55:38.001 --> 55:39.378
I mean, I don't get cats.

55:39.461 --> 55:41.213
One minute you're cool, and the next...

55:41.296 --> 55:42.839
- Scratching your eyes out.
- Totally.

55:42.923 --> 55:44.675
- They're evil.
- Unpredictable.

55:44.758 --> 55:46.593
- Yes. Agreed.
- Mm.

55:46.677 --> 55:48.512
- Pirate bird all the way.
- Aargh.

55:51.306 --> 55:52.641
You're fun to talk to.

55:52.724 --> 55:54.810
Thanks. But the accent does all the work.

55:57.062 --> 55:58.063
Can I ask...?

55:58.146 --> 55:59.147
Yes.

56:02.359 --> 56:03.485
Your ring.

56:07.197 --> 56:08.699
I'm sorry.

56:08.782 --> 56:10.325
- I should've taken it off.
- No.

56:10.409 --> 56:12.619
I just, somehow, uh...

56:14.580 --> 56:18.542
I just didn't wanna start with,
"Hi, I have a dead boyfriend."

56:19.084 --> 56:21.378
We were very much in love,

56:21.461 --> 56:24.923
and he bought a ring
and died before he could propose.

56:27.092 --> 56:28.176
I'm sorry.

56:29.386 --> 56:31.179
I was engaged once.

56:32.306 --> 56:34.141
Oh, really. What happened?

56:34.224 --> 56:35.392
I don't know.

56:36.351 --> 56:38.687
She decided she didn't want
to go through with it.

56:39.354 --> 56:40.564
The week before the wedding.

56:41.189 --> 56:43.191
- Jeez.
- The worst part of it was...

56:46.778 --> 56:49.239
being left with all these questions.

56:51.742 --> 56:55.495
To be honest, I may have gone crazy
trying to figure out what went wrong.

56:56.121 --> 56:57.664
Well, did you figure it out?

57:01.084 --> 57:03.879
Love is a mystery.

57:06.298 --> 57:08.342
And in a restless world like this one...

57:11.845 --> 57:13.138
it can be ended...

57:14.556 --> 57:15.807
before it's even begun.

57:16.975 --> 57:17.976
You're funny.

57:19.269 --> 57:20.479
Come on.

57:21.229 --> 57:22.230
Okay.

57:28.487 --> 57:30.030
<i>Okay, okay, one more, one more.</i>

57:30.113 --> 57:33.492
Um... Would you rather say
everything you're thinking

57:33.575 --> 57:36.244
or never say anything at all?

57:39.164 --> 57:39.998
Mm...

57:40.666 --> 57:41.958
- What? No way.
- Mm-hm!

57:42.042 --> 57:44.503
- What? What?
- Mm. Mm!

57:45.170 --> 57:48.674
What, you're telling me you'd choose
to always say everything you're thinking?

57:48.757 --> 57:50.967
Yeah. I already do.

57:51.051 --> 57:52.552
Okay, what are you thinking right now?

57:58.350 --> 57:59.976
I think you're very cute.

58:05.065 --> 58:07.734
Why do you love these questions so much?

58:09.027 --> 58:13.490
'Cause they are very telling of people
and they cut through the bullshit.

58:18.078 --> 58:22.624
Do you think you could fall in love
with someone just through their words?

58:26.503 --> 58:28.296
Yeah, sure.

58:29.256 --> 58:30.966
But you know what they say.

58:31.049 --> 58:33.635
Actions speak louder than words.

58:33.719 --> 58:34.845
- Ah.
- Mm-hm.

58:34.928 --> 58:38.557
Well, what about these actions?

58:40.559 --> 58:42.561
What, like... Oh, we're dancing?

58:42.644 --> 58:46.148
- What, are you gonna leave me hanging?
- No, I'm not. I don't know what to do.

58:47.899 --> 58:48.900
- Whoo!
- Oh.

58:48.984 --> 58:50.444
- All right.
- Ah.

58:51.319 --> 58:52.529
- Wow!
- Ah.

58:52.612 --> 58:54.573
- That was smooth.
- Thank you.

58:54.656 --> 58:56.700
You're really feeling this music,
aren't you?

58:56.783 --> 58:58.660
Yeah. This isn't...
Playing my favorite song.

58:58.744 --> 58:59.578
- Okay.
- Oh.

58:59.661 --> 59:01.705
Whoa.

59:11.214 --> 59:13.008
You know he stopped playing, right?

59:14.426 --> 59:15.427
Oh.

59:15.510 --> 59:18.388
Well, I still hear the music.

59:42.621 --> 59:44.790
Have you always been this much into music?

59:44.873 --> 59:46.082
Oh, yeah, definitely.

59:46.166 --> 59:49.544
My mom, she filled the house
with it growing up.

59:50.337 --> 59:51.963
- She played everything.
- Really?

59:52.047 --> 59:53.673
Classical, rock,

59:54.466 --> 59:56.802
- traditional Scottish, jazz.
- Wow.

59:56.885 --> 59:59.429
- That's really cool.
- Yeah, she was pretty cool.

59:59.513 --> 01:00:01.223
What about you? What are you into?

01:00:01.306 --> 01:00:03.642
I love hip-hop.
Hip-hop's my favorite.

01:00:03.725 --> 01:00:04.810
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:00:04.893 --> 01:00:07.020
Cardi B all day every day.

01:00:07.103 --> 01:00:09.564
- Have you heard of her?
- She's very catchy.

01:00:14.861 --> 01:00:15.862
What?

01:00:19.074 --> 01:00:20.075
I like you.

01:00:23.370 --> 01:00:24.329
Um...

01:00:24.913 --> 01:00:25.956
I like you too.

01:00:30.293 --> 01:00:31.294
Mira, I...

01:00:36.299 --> 01:00:37.551
I need to tell you something.

01:00:37.634 --> 01:00:38.635
What?

01:00:45.976 --> 01:00:48.186
I do not want this date to end.

01:00:49.312 --> 01:00:52.399
Well, who says it has to?

01:00:53.316 --> 01:00:56.152
Well, it is morning now.

01:00:56.236 --> 01:00:57.821
Which is crazy.

01:01:00.073 --> 01:01:02.367
Wow. Yeah, it is.

01:01:02.951 --> 01:01:03.952
Um...

01:01:04.786 --> 01:01:07.914
Look, it was a really great night
and, uh...

01:01:08.790 --> 01:01:10.959
I'll see you around. Text me.

01:01:11.751 --> 01:01:12.752
See you.

01:01:14.337 --> 01:01:15.630
Or...

01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:19.551
just 'cause we're crazy kids, um...

01:01:20.385 --> 01:01:24.264
we could go back to our places,
shower up, change,

01:01:24.347 --> 01:01:27.475
and maybe meet tonight at mine

01:01:27.559 --> 01:01:28.852
to make dinner?

01:01:28.935 --> 01:01:30.729
Yeah, that sounds great.

01:01:30.812 --> 01:01:32.731
- Yeah?
- I warn you, I'm not much of a cook.

01:01:32.814 --> 01:01:34.608
Oh, perfect. Me neither.

01:01:37.277 --> 01:01:39.195
Okay, so tonight.

01:01:39.279 --> 01:01:40.280
Tonight.

01:02:08.266 --> 01:02:09.893
- Mmm. Mmm!
- Mmm.

01:02:10.769 --> 01:02:13.563
- Good stuff.
- That company wanted us to fail.

01:02:13.647 --> 01:02:15.148
Oh, totally.

01:02:15.857 --> 01:02:18.193
Also, we're terrible cooks.

01:02:20.111 --> 01:02:25.408
The cereal-to-milk ratio in this bowl
of Cinnamon Toast Crunch

01:02:25.492 --> 01:02:26.576
is perfection.

01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:29.037
Why, thank you, kind sir.

01:02:30.038 --> 01:02:31.039
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

01:02:34.626 --> 01:02:35.627
You know...

01:02:36.461 --> 01:02:38.004
I would learn to cook for you.

01:02:52.644 --> 01:02:53.937
How did he die?

01:02:55.855 --> 01:02:56.690
Um...

01:02:58.400 --> 01:02:59.734
It was a drunk driver.

01:03:01.736 --> 01:03:02.904
In broad daylight.

01:03:06.658 --> 01:03:07.993
It's been two years.

01:03:08.994 --> 01:03:10.453
And I still can't believe it.

01:03:12.706 --> 01:03:15.291
- I'm sorry. I'm just...
- No, no.

01:03:16.251 --> 01:03:19.629
You can't really prepare
for something like that, can you?

01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:23.842
I was so sure we'd grow old together.

01:03:26.219 --> 01:03:28.555
And now I'm the only one growing older.

01:03:29.264 --> 01:03:30.890
He's exactly the same.

01:03:32.976 --> 01:03:34.352
Same eyes...

01:03:35.395 --> 01:03:39.482
same voice, same smile.

01:03:41.735 --> 01:03:43.403
Exactly how I remember it.

01:03:46.031 --> 01:03:47.782
I'm the only one who's changing.

01:03:51.036 --> 01:03:52.912
All right, enough about me.

01:03:54.539 --> 01:03:57.917
Tell me, um... tell me more about you.

01:03:58.001 --> 01:03:59.294
What else do you like?

01:04:00.503 --> 01:04:01.504
Besides music.

01:04:02.213 --> 01:04:04.716
Oh, um... Well, that's easy.

01:04:06.301 --> 01:04:07.302
I love basketball.

01:04:07.886 --> 01:04:09.137
We should play some time.

01:04:09.846 --> 01:04:11.347
- I'd like that.
- Mm-hm.

01:04:12.140 --> 01:04:15.226
But, uh, are you any good?

01:04:16.644 --> 01:04:19.397
Well, you're just gonna have
to find out, now, mister.

01:04:23.193 --> 01:04:24.819
I really like your voice.

01:04:27.197 --> 01:04:29.991
Tell me more
about why you like basketball.

01:04:30.075 --> 01:04:32.744
I feel like you can learn more

01:04:32.827 --> 01:04:35.246
by playing ten minutes of basketball
with someone

01:04:35.330 --> 01:04:38.416
than you can talking to them
for a whole hour.

01:04:39.167 --> 01:04:40.794
How they work with other people.

01:04:40.877 --> 01:04:42.253
Face opposition.

01:04:43.254 --> 01:04:45.632
And not to sound too grandiose
or anything...

01:04:47.675 --> 01:04:49.928
but kind of feel
the game represents life itself.

01:04:51.054 --> 01:04:53.098
All these people
are from different places...

01:04:54.599 --> 01:04:56.226
gathered to play the same game.

01:04:58.228 --> 01:05:00.230
Different cultures, races.

01:05:00.313 --> 01:05:02.315
It doesn't matter where you're from.

01:05:04.651 --> 01:05:05.652
Yeah.

01:05:06.861 --> 01:05:13.284
Yeah, it's what makes this country,
this city, so...

01:05:21.209 --> 01:05:22.544
So beautiful.

01:06:11.092 --> 01:06:12.093

01:06:53.301 --> 01:06:54.594
So she fell asleep?

01:06:54.677 --> 01:06:56.179
- Yeah.
- And you...

01:06:56.846 --> 01:06:59.390
decided to stay on the couch?

01:06:59.474 --> 01:07:02.101
Oh, I just wanted
to make sure she was okay.

01:07:02.185 --> 01:07:03.353
Yeah.

No, it's fine.

01:07:08.650 --> 01:07:09.817
Okay.

01:07:09.901 --> 01:07:11.236
What do you...?

01:07:11.319 --> 01:07:15.281
I will see your...
And I will raise you some Indian...

01:07:16.032 --> 01:07:20.453

to a live One Direction concert?

01:07:20.536 --> 01:07:21.913
Yeah. Yeah, I...

his entire first album on his iPhone.

01:07:32.548 --> 01:07:33.508
That is awesome.

01:07:34.217 --> 01:07:35.051

01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:37.720

- Oh. Hey.

01:07:37.804 --> 01:07:40.348
Look! Rolls, coffee. Coffee, rolls.

01:07:40.431 --> 01:07:42.976
Rob bought you rolls and coffee.

01:07:43.851 --> 01:07:44.936
So nice.

01:07:48.940 --> 01:07:51.234
I have to go to Soul Cycle.

01:07:51.317 --> 01:07:53.611
It's this thing I do on Sunday.

01:07:53.695 --> 01:07:55.280
- I just can't, you know...
- Oh.

01:07:55.363 --> 01:07:57.198
Uh, yeah. I better go too.

01:07:57.282 --> 01:07:58.366
No, don't!

01:07:58.449 --> 01:08:01.202
You should totally stay
and finish your breakfast.

01:08:01.286 --> 01:08:02.161
Have coffee.

01:08:03.788 --> 01:08:06.040
Um... I'll see you later.

01:08:07.166 --> 01:08:09.377
Just text me. I'll text you. Okay.

01:08:14.299 --> 01:08:17.510

01:09:39.217 --> 01:09:40.885
You've talked to the unknown texter?

01:09:40.968 --> 01:09:45.056
Well, uh, she's not unknown anymore.

01:09:46.265 --> 01:09:48.601
Come on, let's have a little chat.

01:09:48.684 --> 01:09:51.229
The more I get to know her,
the better I like her.

01:09:51.312 --> 01:09:55.024
But she's still completely stuck
on her former boyfriend.

01:09:56.442 --> 01:09:58.027
And he's dead.

01:09:58.111 --> 01:09:59.362
This is a big problem.

01:10:02.115 --> 01:10:03.282
What is her name?

01:10:03.908 --> 01:10:04.909
Mira.

01:10:07.787 --> 01:10:08.996
Mira Ray.

01:10:09.664 --> 01:10:12.708
The Mira Ray who writes
the caterpillar books?

01:10:13.459 --> 01:10:14.627
You've read them?

01:10:15.711 --> 01:10:18.464
I have three children,
of course I read them. They're amazing.

01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:20.675
What do you think of this?

01:10:21.968 --> 01:10:23.136
Okay, are you serious?

01:10:23.845 --> 01:10:25.805
I hate it. What am I doing?

01:10:25.888 --> 01:10:27.598
It looks like I'm standing in hell.

01:10:28.182 --> 01:10:31.519
Listen, the concept needs
to be bigger, brighter.

01:10:31.602 --> 01:10:33.062
More joyful.

01:10:33.146 --> 01:10:34.147
Yeah?

but I have an idea.

I'm so honored. Uh, thank you so much.

01:11:49.597 --> 01:11:51.015
Are you free?

01:11:52.016 --> 01:11:54.894
I've always wanted to meet
the creator of the Bhoomi books.

<i>I love them so much.</i>

01:12:03.194 --> 01:12:04.904
I really like your presence.

01:12:06.489 --> 01:12:10.117
Oh, wow. I really like your presence too.

01:12:10.201 --> 01:12:12.662
I mean, you have the presence, so...

01:12:13.996 --> 01:12:16.541
It's been quite a long time
since the last Bhoomi book.

01:12:17.792 --> 01:12:19.418
Yes, I have been...

01:12:19.502 --> 01:12:21.671
How would you like to design
my tour poster?

01:12:22.630 --> 01:12:23.756
Are you serious?

01:12:23.839 --> 01:12:27.301
Is there anything in my expression
that conveys a lack of seriousness?

01:12:28.010 --> 01:12:31.597
It's just such an honor
that you would even consider me.

01:12:31.681 --> 01:12:33.099
I want something great.

01:12:34.225 --> 01:12:37.019
And I know you can do it.

01:12:41.148 --> 01:12:43.693
I would need to see some ideas
at the end of this week.

01:12:44.193 --> 01:12:45.695
Yes. Of course.

01:12:45.778 --> 01:12:46.779

Oh.

01:12:55.663 --> 01:12:56.747
Yes.

01:13:02.295 --> 01:13:04.255
Hey.

01:13:04.338 --> 01:13:06.007
What are you doing right now?

01:13:06.090 --> 01:13:09.885
The Céline Dion calls me randomly

01:13:09.969 --> 01:13:12.763
and says,
"I want you to design my tour poster."

01:13:12.847 --> 01:13:15.266
I just met her. That's just... What?

01:13:16.142 --> 01:13:18.936
You open yourself up to the universe
and it'll come rushing in.

01:13:19.020 --> 01:13:20.980
Yeah, but this is crazy.

01:13:21.063 --> 01:13:23.149
Well, it's crazy. Yeah.

01:13:23.232 --> 01:13:24.984
Okay. Look...

01:13:25.067 --> 01:13:27.486
I'm really sorry about ghosting you
the other day.

01:13:27.570 --> 01:13:29.488
No. No, it's...

01:13:29.572 --> 01:13:31.449
Here's me apologizing, okay?

01:13:32.325 --> 01:13:33.326
Here you go.

01:13:33.409 --> 01:13:34.994
Huh. What's this?

01:13:35.077 --> 01:13:38.164
It's champagne, in a can,
'cause we're classy.

01:13:38.247 --> 01:13:39.540
What are we celebrating?

01:13:41.709 --> 01:13:42.710
Change.

01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:45.588
Also...

01:13:46.297 --> 01:13:48.633
I thought this might be a good time...

01:13:50.551 --> 01:13:53.387
to figure out what type of person you are.

01:13:53.471 --> 01:13:55.139
- Yep.
- Okay.

01:13:55.222 --> 01:13:57.141
- You ready to tell me...
- I see.

01:13:57.224 --> 01:13:58.267
...everything about you?

01:13:58.351 --> 01:13:59.477
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:01.354
- Let's go.
- This way.

01:14:02.396 --> 01:14:03.773
- Huh? Oh. Oh!
- Whoo!

01:14:05.316 --> 01:14:07.318
No fair, you conned me.

01:14:07.401 --> 01:14:09.612
Well, you're not the only Knicks fan
on this court.

01:14:09.695 --> 01:14:10.863
Huh.

01:14:11.405 --> 01:14:12.406
Okay.

01:14:13.407 --> 01:14:14.408
What?

01:14:15.493 --> 01:14:17.411
- What, you're gonna give me this shot?
- Sure.

01:14:17.495 --> 01:14:18.746
- You're rusty.
- Uh-huh.

01:14:18.829 --> 01:14:20.039
- Go for it.
- Okay.

01:14:21.791 --> 01:14:24.543
- Whoa!
- Look at that. Confident.

01:14:24.627 --> 01:14:25.961
I like it. I like it.

01:14:26.045 --> 01:14:27.296
- Game point.
- Okay.

01:14:28.047 --> 01:14:29.131
Ready to lose?

01:14:29.215 --> 01:14:30.216
Never.

01:14:31.092 --> 01:14:33.469
- Care to make it interesting?
- What do you have in mind?

01:14:34.345 --> 01:14:36.347
- Well, if I win...
- Uh-huh?

01:14:36.430 --> 01:14:37.807
we go back to your place.

01:14:37.890 --> 01:14:38.891
Uh-huh?

01:14:38.974 --> 01:14:40.685
And I get to have my way with you.

01:14:40.768 --> 01:14:41.894
Huh.

01:14:41.977 --> 01:14:43.145
And if I win?

01:14:44.313 --> 01:14:46.023
I could cook for you again.

01:15:14.468 --> 01:15:15.636
Good morning.

01:15:18.389 --> 01:15:19.390
Good morning.

01:15:27.732 --> 01:15:28.566
Hm.

01:15:30.484 --> 01:15:31.610
Shit.

01:15:31.694 --> 01:15:32.695
What?

01:15:34.488 --> 01:15:37.450
I have to be in the newsroom
in 15 minutes.

01:15:39.243 --> 01:15:40.911
- Seriously?
- Mm-hm.

01:15:43.998 --> 01:15:44.999
No.

01:15:51.046 --> 01:15:52.131
Sorry.

01:15:56.093 --> 01:15:57.428
Okay.

01:15:57.511 --> 01:15:58.804
I better get ready.

01:15:59.972 --> 01:16:01.223

Mira, wait.
Please. You don't understand.

01:18:05.764 --> 01:18:08.225
I know I should have told you.
I wanted to tell you.

01:18:08.309 --> 01:18:10.102
I tried to tell you, but...

01:18:10.185 --> 01:18:13.814
Like, I didn't know how.
The circumstances were so incredible.

01:18:13.898 --> 01:18:15.983
So you read all my texts to John?

01:18:17.234 --> 01:18:19.153
Lied to my face this whole time.

01:18:21.113 --> 01:18:22.114
Why?

01:18:23.073 --> 01:18:25.659
'Cause you're a creep
or just some asshole?

01:18:25.743 --> 01:18:27.494
Neither. Those are both terrible choices.

01:18:27.578 --> 01:18:31.040
But I was afraid you'd stop talking to me
if you knew the truth. But, Mira...

01:18:31.123 --> 01:18:34.752
- Mira, my feelings for you are so real.
- You took John away from me.

01:18:36.003 --> 01:18:38.505
I didn't take him away from you.
He's gone.

01:18:42.509 --> 01:18:43.761
John is gone.

01:18:48.515 --> 01:18:51.685
I'm so sorry.
I didn't want you to find out like this.

01:18:51.769 --> 01:18:54.396
- I wanted to tell you before...
- Before what?

01:18:55.773 --> 01:18:57.274
Before you slept with me?

01:19:01.195 --> 01:19:03.906
If you have any decency,
you'll erase my number

01:19:03.989 --> 01:19:05.240
and never call me again.

01:19:05.324 --> 01:19:06.450
- Mira, I...
- Goodbye, Rob.

01:19:07.868 --> 01:19:08.994

Hey.

01:20:37.499 --> 01:20:38.834
- Mo.
- Hey.

01:20:41.879 --> 01:20:42.880
Who's your friend?

01:20:43.505 --> 01:20:45.549
That's Jane. I've known her a long time.

01:20:45.632 --> 01:20:47.092
- Long time?
- Two days.

01:20:48.552 --> 01:20:51.430
- Oh, my God. Are you dating?
- Mira inspired me.

01:20:52.681 --> 01:20:54.933
- What did I do?
- I saw you with that Rob guy...

01:20:55.017 --> 01:20:56.894
- Mm-mm. Mm-mm.
- No, no. No, listen.

01:20:56.977 --> 01:20:59.772
And when the last person left
the other night, I sat down.

01:21:01.273 --> 01:21:03.150
I poured Roxy and me two shots.

01:21:03.859 --> 01:21:05.694
I drank them both, as I always do.

01:21:05.778 --> 01:21:08.280
Then I lit a candle, and I said to Roxy,

01:21:08.363 --> 01:21:10.574
"I will always be your husband.

01:21:10.657 --> 01:21:13.911
But what I'm really missing,
like in my core,

01:21:13.994 --> 01:21:15.788
is sharing a joke with someone

01:21:15.871 --> 01:21:17.664
when I'm feeling down in the mouth."

01:21:18.290 --> 01:21:20.834
And dead people, not so funny.

01:21:22.252 --> 01:21:23.295
So, um...

01:21:24.755 --> 01:21:25.756
Thank you.

01:21:31.887 --> 01:21:34.181
What can we do?

01:21:34.264 --> 01:21:35.099
Huh?

01:21:35.724 --> 01:21:36.767
Oh, nothing.

01:21:37.726 --> 01:21:39.394
Nothing. Rob ruined it.

01:21:41.230 --> 01:21:42.773
What was I supposed to do?

01:21:42.856 --> 01:21:45.484
You should have said something
to her right away.

01:21:45.567 --> 01:21:47.111
What should I have said?

01:21:48.070 --> 01:21:50.280
"Excuse me, I'd like to get to know you,

01:21:50.364 --> 01:21:54.368
but I keep getting these text messages
you write your dead boyfriend.

01:21:54.451 --> 01:21:56.411
I would have said something earlier,

01:21:56.495 --> 01:21:58.455
but I didn't wanna take away
the possibility

01:21:58.539 --> 01:22:00.124
for you to stay in contact with him.

01:22:00.207 --> 01:22:02.668
I know this is the weirdest way
to get to know someone,

01:22:02.751 --> 01:22:04.711
and I understand
if you just wanna walk away.

01:22:04.795 --> 01:22:06.797
But I didn't wanna start off
by telling you a lie."

01:22:07.506 --> 01:22:08.507
- Yeah. Exactly.
- Mm-hm.

01:22:09.133 --> 01:22:10.509
Shit.

01:22:11.260 --> 01:22:12.594
It might have actually worked.

01:22:13.595 --> 01:22:14.972
So, what now?

01:22:15.597 --> 01:22:16.723
I don't know.

01:22:18.517 --> 01:22:22.229
I can't call her.
And there's no way for me to reach her.

01:22:23.313 --> 01:22:25.983
That sucks.

01:22:39.913 --> 01:22:41.165
What time's deadline?

01:22:41.748 --> 01:22:42.624
Why?

01:22:42.708 --> 01:22:44.793
I don't like that look in your eyes. Rob!

01:22:45.419 --> 01:22:47.629
Oh, boy. This is very stressful.

01:22:47.713 --> 01:22:49.173
Where are you going? Rob?

01:22:49.256 --> 01:22:51.967
- Can you just calm down?
- Rob!

01:23:07.733 --> 01:23:08.817
Holy shit.

01:23:10.152 --> 01:23:10.986
What?

01:23:11.069 --> 01:23:13.739
Bernard just sent me this
and asked me if I'd seen it.

01:23:21.330 --> 01:23:22.456
I don't need to read that.

01:23:31.215 --> 01:23:32.466
"Texts for Mira...

01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:35.177
- by Rob Burns."
- Stop.

01:23:36.178 --> 01:23:39.348
"This was actually supposed to be
a profile on Céline Dion

01:23:39.431 --> 01:23:41.308
as she continues
on her first American tour

01:23:41.391 --> 01:23:44.061
in over ten years
at the Barclays Center this weekend.

01:23:44.144 --> 01:23:47.439
My assignment was to get her to open up,
reveal who she really is.

01:23:47.522 --> 01:23:49.399
Unfortunately, I did not succeed.

01:23:49.483 --> 01:23:52.110
Instead, Miss Dion opened me.

01:23:52.986 --> 01:23:56.907
When she told me I wasn't capable
of hearing her music, I scoffed.

01:23:56.990 --> 01:24:00.744
What was there to hear? A bunch of
sentimental platitudes on life and love?

01:24:00.827 --> 01:24:03.413
I had no room for such nonsense
in my life because..."

01:24:03.497 --> 01:24:05.165
<i>...because I knew love was a myth.</i>

01:24:05.249 --> 01:24:07.376
<i>A shared delusion between two people</i>

01:24:07.459 --> 01:24:09.670
<i>that could end as soon
as someone changed their mind.</i>

01:24:09.753 --> 01:24:11.255
<i>Then I got your texts.</i>

01:24:11.338 --> 01:24:14.758
<i>Slowly, I began
to realize Céline was right.</i>

01:24:14.841 --> 01:24:17.552
<i>I couldn't hear the music.
'Cause my heart had given up on love.</i>

01:24:17.636 --> 01:24:20.847
<i>I know you didn't mean to text me
your innermost thoughts and feelings,</i>

01:24:20.931 --> 01:24:21.765
<i>but you did.</i>

01:24:21.848 --> 01:24:24.559
<i>And I made a big mistake
by not telling you that right away.</i>

01:24:24.643 --> 01:24:26.853
<i>And I do not deserve a second chance.</i>

01:24:26.937 --> 01:24:29.690
<i>But thanks to you,
I can hear the music again.</i>

01:24:29.773 --> 01:24:32.484
<i>I hear it in the sound of your voice
when you call my name.</i>

01:24:32.567 --> 01:24:35.862
<i>Your laughter after asking me
ridiculous "Would you rather" questions.</i>

01:24:35.946 --> 01:24:39.157
<i>And that slow, gentle breath you take
just before falling asleep.</i>

01:24:39.241 --> 01:24:41.118
<i>I know love is real</i>

01:24:41.201 --> 01:24:42.828
<i>'cause I've fallen in love with you.</i>

01:24:42.911 --> 01:24:44.871
<i>And if you can find it in your heart
to forgive me,</i>

01:24:44.955 --> 01:24:47.624
<i>I promise I'll do everything I can
to earn your trust back.</i>

01:24:47.708 --> 01:24:49.668
<i>'Cause a new day has come for me, Mira.</i>

01:24:49.751 --> 01:24:51.586
<i>Where it was dark, now it's light.</i>

01:24:51.670 --> 01:24:54.506
<i>Where there was pain, now there's joy.</i>

01:24:54.589 --> 01:24:57.801
<i>Where there was weakness,
I found my strength.</i>

01:24:59.011 --> 01:25:01.346
And I'm not afraid to tell the world...

01:25:02.222 --> 01:25:04.766
I've been touched by an angel with love.

01:25:05.892 --> 01:25:09.521
<i>Meet me tonight at the place
where I learned to hear the music again.</i>

01:25:10.897 --> 01:25:12.899
"Please give this another chance.

01:25:13.442 --> 01:25:15.569
Please give me another chance."

01:25:27.247 --> 01:25:29.791
Seriously? She listening?

01:25:29.875 --> 01:25:31.668
Céline Dion.

01:25:32.252 --> 01:25:34.838
What even is your life right now?

01:25:36.131 --> 01:25:37.132
Just...

01:25:39.801 --> 01:25:41.178
- Hello?
- <i>First off,</i>

01:25:41.261 --> 01:25:44.389
I want you to know
that Rob didn't put me up to this.

01:25:46.141 --> 01:25:48.894
- Sure.
- You know I lost my husband, yes?

01:25:48.977 --> 01:25:51.146
<i>He was the first and only love of my life.</i>

01:25:51.688 --> 01:25:53.273
I'm so sorry.

01:25:53.357 --> 01:25:56.735
René may have lied to me once
before we were married.

01:25:56.818 --> 01:25:57.736
He did?

01:25:58.278 --> 01:25:59.363
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:25:59.446 --> 01:26:00.739
<i>About Seal.</i>

01:26:00.822 --> 01:26:01.698
The animal--

01:26:01.782 --> 01:26:03.909
The singer, Seal. Of course.

01:26:03.992 --> 01:26:05.452
It was 1991,

01:26:05.535 --> 01:26:08.747
and Seal, the singer,

01:26:08.830 --> 01:26:10.540
had just released his first album.

01:26:10.624 --> 01:26:13.377
<i>I wanted to sing a duet with him so badly,</i>

01:26:13.460 --> 01:26:15.796
<i>but René told me he wasn't too interested.</i>

01:26:15.879 --> 01:26:17.297
Turns out René was jealous.

01:26:17.381 --> 01:26:19.591
He didn't want me around Seal at all.

01:26:19.674 --> 01:26:21.676
Were you mad when he lied?

01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:23.178
<i>Of course I was mad.</i>

01:26:23.261 --> 01:26:25.555
But we worked through it.

01:26:25.639 --> 01:26:28.350
Because that's what you do
when you're in love.

01:26:28.433 --> 01:26:30.227
<i>You work through things.</i>

01:26:30.310 --> 01:26:32.896
<i>Also, René agreed
to do the dishes for life</i>

01:26:32.979 --> 01:26:34.439
<i>in return for my forgiveness.</i>

01:26:34.523 --> 01:26:36.608
- You guys did your own dishes?
<i>- No.</i>

01:26:36.691 --> 01:26:40.320
We don't do a lot of dishes.
But you get the point?

01:26:43.990 --> 01:26:47.327
I'm just a bit confused.

01:26:47.411 --> 01:26:48.286
<i>Look, Mira.</i>

01:26:48.370 --> 01:26:50.997
I don't really care
whether you and Rob get together.

01:26:51.581 --> 01:26:52.582
You don't?

01:26:53.708 --> 01:26:56.753
No. My only concern is you.

01:26:58.505 --> 01:26:59.339
<i>Now...</i>

01:26:59.923 --> 01:27:01.425
how's my poster coming along?

01:27:02.384 --> 01:27:03.969
I'm working on it.

01:27:04.052 --> 01:27:07.180
Have you lost your mind?

01:27:07.264 --> 01:27:08.598
This is a newspaper.

01:27:08.682 --> 01:27:11.977
Not some sort of dating service.

01:27:12.060 --> 01:27:14.229
What am I supposed
to tell our publishers, eh?

01:27:14.855 --> 01:27:16.356
What are they gonna say?

01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:18.150
They are serious people.

01:27:18.900 --> 01:27:23.071
You have put the entire
newspaper's reputation at risk!

01:27:24.239 --> 01:27:30.871
Rob, this is the most
unprofessional behavior

01:27:30.954 --> 01:27:35.167
I have ever seen in my life!

01:27:35.250 --> 01:27:37.544
No!

01:27:37.627 --> 01:27:40.380
You total dickhead!

01:27:40.464 --> 01:27:42.549
I have to make them think
I'm ripping you to shreds.

01:27:42.632 --> 01:27:45.594
Or else they'll all try and publish
stories about their personal lives.

01:27:46.761 --> 01:27:48.472
I can't bear you!

01:27:48.555 --> 01:27:51.475
- You think you could slip something by me?
- I'm sorry?

01:27:51.558 --> 01:27:53.560
What? Don't answer me back!

01:27:53.643 --> 01:27:55.979
- Well done. It was quite a moving piece.
- Thank you.

01:27:56.062 --> 01:28:00.692
It's great for you 'cause, uh, well,
I've decided you can do your podcast.

01:28:02.736 --> 01:28:04.237
What? Seriously?

01:28:05.739 --> 01:28:06.865
That's amazing.

01:28:07.657 --> 01:28:10.410
Well, you gotta win her back now.

01:28:10.494 --> 01:28:12.162
Make for a hell of a follow-up piece.

01:28:12.245 --> 01:28:14.164
You've got your heart back, Rob.

01:28:14.247 --> 01:28:15.248
Well done.

01:28:15.999 --> 01:28:17.334
Thank you, boss.

01:28:18.418 --> 01:28:19.920

- Yeah.

No. I don't know where she is,
and she's not answering her phone either.

Okay.

01:30:50.278 --> 01:30:51.112
Uh, wait.

01:30:51.821 --> 01:30:53.657

01:31:07.796 --> 01:31:09.381
- It's beautiful.
- Mm-hm.

01:31:19.391 --> 01:31:21.768
It looks like she's finally moving on.

01:31:23.895 --> 01:31:25.230

Yeah.

01:31:51.673 --> 01:31:53.341
- Wait, that's it.
- Hm?

01:31:54.467 --> 01:31:55.301
Suzy, that--

01:31:55.385 --> 01:31:57.011
- That's-- Whoa! Why?
- Thank you.

01:31:57.095 --> 01:31:59.180
Yeah, sure. Anytime. Glad I could--

01:31:59.889 --> 01:32:02.225
Uh, okay. Catch up with you later.

01:32:08.732 --> 01:32:09.733

01:33:13.296 --> 01:33:14.297
Mira!

01:33:27.560 --> 01:33:30.563
I was starting to wonder
if you changed your mind.

01:33:31.147 --> 01:33:34.442
- I'm sorry. I was in the park.
- Yeah. I figured.

01:33:35.777 --> 01:33:38.822
Also, Suzy sent me
about a thousand texts

01:33:38.905 --> 01:33:39.906
telling me that.

01:33:41.533 --> 01:33:43.284
I have a few conditions, Rob.

01:33:45.453 --> 01:33:46.496
Of course.

01:33:47.121 --> 01:33:51.543
First of all, no more lying. Never.

01:33:52.210 --> 01:33:54.838
I won't. Ever, ever, ever again.

01:33:54.921 --> 01:33:58.174
I need the full truth from you
at all times.

01:33:58.258 --> 01:34:00.844
Even if it's messy. Even if it's painful.

01:34:01.719 --> 01:34:04.097
Especially if it's messy and painful.

01:34:05.265 --> 01:34:07.642
'Cause that's life, you know?

01:34:07.725 --> 01:34:09.811
And if we can't get through it together,

01:34:09.894 --> 01:34:12.689
then what's the point, right?

01:34:13.898 --> 01:34:14.899
Right.

01:34:16.234 --> 01:34:17.694
I'll always love John.

01:34:18.236 --> 01:34:19.237
I know.

01:34:22.699 --> 01:34:24.117
I'll always miss John.

01:34:26.369 --> 01:34:27.370
I know.

01:34:30.206 --> 01:34:33.668
And I don't know
how this grief will change over time...

01:34:34.627 --> 01:34:37.046
but it's always going to be a part of me.

01:34:42.093 --> 01:34:43.303
I understand.

01:34:45.889 --> 01:34:47.056
You understand.

01:34:48.683 --> 01:34:49.684
I know.

01:34:51.519 --> 01:34:53.396
And I appreciate it so much.

01:34:55.064 --> 01:34:56.065
Anything else?

01:34:58.526 --> 01:35:02.322
Well, you're gonna have to learn
how to cook 'cause I can't.

01:35:03.156 --> 01:35:04.741
I'll sign up for lessons right away.

01:35:06.534 --> 01:35:08.369
And Céline said you need to do the dishes.

01:35:08.453 --> 01:35:09.829
Of course.

Hello, and welcome

01:39:51.444 --> 01:39:53.571
with me, your host, Rob Burns.

01:39:53.654 --> 01:39:56.199
Where we get
into all that really weird stuff

01:39:56.282 --> 01:39:58.326
with our favorite musicians.

01:39:58.409 --> 01:40:01.954
So without further ado,
I'd like to welcome our first guest.

01:40:02.038 --> 01:40:04.415
She is an uber-talented,

01:40:04.498 --> 01:40:08.669
multifaceted singer-songwriter
extraordinaire,

01:40:08.753 --> 01:40:11.547
philosopher, matchmaker,

01:40:11.631 --> 01:40:12.882
the list could go on.

01:40:12.965 --> 01:40:17.470
Please put your hands together
and welcome none other than

01:40:17.553 --> 01:40:19.639
Miss Céline Dion!

01:40:19.722 --> 01:40:22.808
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you.

01:40:22.892 --> 01:40:24.352
Céline, welcome to the show.

01:40:24.435 --> 01:40:26.771
And before we move on
to the really good stuff,

01:40:26.854 --> 01:40:29.232
- I have a very burning question for you.
- Ooh.

01:40:29.315 --> 01:40:31.776
Would you rather own ten cats

01:40:31.859 --> 01:40:34.946
or a parrot that sits on your head
for 22 hours a day?

01:40:35.029 --> 01:40:36.906
Oh! Uh...

01:40:36.989 --> 01:40:38.824
I'd go for the parrot.

01:40:40.034 --> 01:40:41.619
- Right answer.
- Yes!

01:40:41.702 --> 01:40:44.705
Céline, we're here to talk about
your new tour.

01:40:44.789 --> 01:40:47.208
- The new album. The new everything.
- Yes.

01:40:47.291 --> 01:40:48.793
The new Céline Dion.
