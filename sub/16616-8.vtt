00:01.460 --> 00:04.922
<i>It seems today that all you see</i>

00:05.005 --> 00:08.175
<i>Is violence in movies and sex on TV</i>

00:08.258 --> 00:11.762
<i>But where are those</i>
<i>good old-fashioned values</i>

00:11.845 --> 00:14.348
<i>On which we used to rely?</i>

00:15.057 --> 00:17.518
<i>Lucky there's a family guy</i>

00:18.310 --> 00:21.522
<i>Lucky there's a man who</i>
<i>positively can do</i>

00:21.605 --> 00:23.148
<i>All the things that make us</i>

00:23.232 --> 00:24.900
<i>Laugh and cry</i>

00:24.983 --> 00:30.155
<i>He's a family guy</i>

00:35.160 --> 00:37.454
<i>And now,</i>
<i>the Game Show network presents</i>

00:37.538 --> 00:40.999
<i>"Are we talking about Jake Gyllenhaal</i>
<i>or Jared Leto?"</i>

00:41.124 --> 00:44.628
<i>I am oily-haired with dinner-plate eyes.</i>

00:45.212 --> 00:48.549
<i>I was in that one movie</i>
<i>about the weirdo.</i>

00:49.091 --> 00:52.594
<i>I somehow look both deathly ill</i>
<i>and ripped.</i>

00:53.554 --> 00:57.140
<i>I am a less successful version</i>
<i>of Tobey Maguire.</i>

00:57.224 --> 00:59.142
<i>Anyone? No?</i>

00:59.226 --> 01:03.564
<i>You would totally believe</i>
<i>any story about me being a dick.</i>

01:03.981 --> 01:06.066
I'm changing the channel.
I like both of them.

01:06.149 --> 01:07.317
Peter, did you see this?

01:07.401 --> 01:11.321
It says here that Carter Pewterschmidt
has bought the Pawtucket Patriot Brewery.

01:11.405 --> 01:13.740
- No, what's that?
- It's where you work, Peter.

01:13.824 --> 01:15.826
Why the hell would Daddy
buy the brewery?

01:15.909 --> 01:17.828
Well, there's children in the room,
watch your swearing.

01:17.911 --> 01:20.539
But apparently, he's looking
to diversify his holdings.

01:20.622 --> 01:24.168
Wow, Dad, I guess that means
Grandpa is your new boss.

01:24.251 --> 01:26.044
Oh, crap. I don't want to work for him.

01:26.128 --> 01:28.213
I'd rather work for Dr. Frankenstein.

01:33.510 --> 01:35.179
Igor, I did it!

01:35.262 --> 01:38.307
Hold on, you discovered the power
to create new life

01:38.390 --> 01:40.225
and you created a guy?

01:40.309 --> 01:44.188
So, I should have made a woman,
so I could have sex with a corpse?

01:44.271 --> 01:47.316
I don't know, man.
You just shouldn't have made a guy.

01:52.946 --> 01:54.865
All right, now that I'm in charge
of this brewery,

01:54.948 --> 01:56.575
there's gonna be
some changes around here.

01:56.658 --> 02:00.412
For one thing, no more T-shirts
or dungarees in the work place.

02:01.038 --> 02:02.748
Dungarees are jeans.

02:03.415 --> 02:05.000
Griffin, what are you doing here?

02:05.083 --> 02:06.460
I... I work here.

02:06.543 --> 02:08.128
You do? No way.

02:08.212 --> 02:09.838
Oh, this is gonna be fun.

02:09.922 --> 02:13.550
Effective immediately, you're the guy
at the office with the weird ski-tan,

02:13.634 --> 02:15.052
but you can't talk about it.

02:15.135 --> 02:16.887
Hey, did you go skiing this weekend?

02:16.970 --> 02:18.680
I'm not allowed to talk about it.

02:25.270 --> 02:26.897
<i>Dog driving a car</i>

02:29.191 --> 02:30.317
Oh, damn it.

02:33.195 --> 02:35.697
Morning, Brian.
I'm afraid you ran a red light.

02:35.781 --> 02:37.449
- Your license, please.

02:37.533 --> 02:40.118
I swear, Joe, the light was still gray
when I went through it.

02:40.202 --> 02:41.203
Mmm-hmm.

02:41.286 --> 02:43.205
- Are you aware this has expired?
- What?

02:43.455 --> 02:44.957
Brian, step out of the vehicle.

02:45.040 --> 02:46.375
Why? Why? Why? What's going on?

02:46.458 --> 02:49.336
Well, the law is clear.
I have to confiscate your license

02:49.419 --> 02:50.921
and you're gonna have to walk home.

02:51.004 --> 02:54.007
- Can't you at least give me a ride?
- No can do, <i>amigo.</i>

02:54.091 --> 02:56.134
All right,
I guess I'll just call an Uber.

03:01.056 --> 03:02.474
Are you Brian?

03:07.729 --> 03:09.273
Oh, Griffin, there you are.

03:09.356 --> 03:10.983
I've decided that as your new boss,

03:11.066 --> 03:13.527
I'm gonna require you
to have a standing desk.

03:14.319 --> 03:17.072
- Oh, but I'll look like such an ass.
- And that's not all.

03:17.155 --> 03:19.867
You've gotta constantly tell everybody
what a good idea it is

03:19.950 --> 03:21.118
and how important it is,

03:21.201 --> 03:23.662
and how wrong they are
for having traditional desks.

03:23.745 --> 03:26.039
Can't I just work at it
and mind my own business?

03:26.123 --> 03:27.666
No! You have to be a freak about it.

03:27.749 --> 03:30.127
Maybe it can just be
my own personal choice,

03:30.210 --> 03:32.045
and I'm not judging others
for their choices.

03:32.129 --> 03:34.673
No, you being right means
everyone else is wrong.

03:34.756 --> 03:37.593
That's what your standing desk
is saying to the chair people.

03:37.676 --> 03:39.636
From now on,
you call them chair people.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.638
Oh, and three times a day,
you have to say,

03:41.722 --> 03:44.266
"Sitting is the biggest killer
in America."

03:55.611 --> 03:56.820
Good night, Peter.

03:56.904 --> 03:58.947
Good night,
gender-transitioned co-worker

03:59.031 --> 04:00.866
we had a whole meeting about.

04:01.241 --> 04:04.786
Mr. Pewterschmidt,
what you're ordering is illegal.

04:04.870 --> 04:05.954
I don't care about that.

04:06.038 --> 04:08.874
I want our beer cans made
from the cheapest material possible.

04:08.957 --> 04:10.751
- But, sir...
- What about those metal toilets

04:10.834 --> 04:12.920
where prisoners make wine?
Use those.

04:13.921 --> 04:15.839
But, sir, if word got out about this,

04:15.923 --> 04:19.259
it would be one of the most notorious
developments in beer history.

04:19.343 --> 04:22.930
Second only to
Michelob Ultra Dragon Fruit Peach.

04:29.269 --> 04:32.356
Peter, are you sure you heard
Mr. Pewterschmidt correctly?

04:32.439 --> 04:35.901
He actually said he wanted
cheap, toxic materials

04:35.984 --> 04:38.403
inserted into the brewery supply stream?

04:38.487 --> 04:41.448
Well, his eyes looked different
how he said it, but that was the gist.

04:41.532 --> 04:44.368
Also, some of the brewery workers
say very hurtful things

04:44.451 --> 04:46.912
if a co-worker wears shorts.
Follow the money.

04:46.995 --> 04:51.041
Mr. Griffin, it sounds like
you've brought me an interesting story.

04:51.124 --> 04:53.877
- What should I do with it, Ollie?
- Make it news!

04:53.961 --> 04:56.672
- Oh, you got a standing desk, too?
- Sitting's bad.

04:56.755 --> 04:58.966
I know. They don't want
to hear it, though.

05:04.847 --> 05:06.682
<i>Sir, there's a reporter here</i>
<i>to see you.</i>

05:06.765 --> 05:09.309
Is it Kermit the Frog
when he's wearing a trench coat?

05:09.393 --> 05:10.978
That tells you he's a reporter.

05:24.491 --> 05:27.244
Sir, an anonymous whistle blower
in the brewery

05:27.327 --> 05:30.122
says you've personally ordered
the sourcing of cut-rate,

05:30.205 --> 05:32.624
potentially toxic canning materials.

05:32.708 --> 05:34.084
God, you're gorgeous.

05:34.168 --> 05:37.838
Mr. Pewterschmidt, I remind you,
this is on the record.

05:37.921 --> 05:40.132
You ever been with a man
who's got a prostate

05:40.215 --> 05:42.301
the size of a beef-steak tomato?

05:52.769 --> 05:54.104
Oh, crap, it's Carter.

05:54.188 --> 05:55.939
I bet he's mad
I told the News about him.

05:56.023 --> 05:58.192
I'll just do what Superman does.

05:59.610 --> 06:00.736
Oh, hey, Carter.

06:00.819 --> 06:02.696
Hello, citizen. Have you seen Peter?

06:02.779 --> 06:05.574
Aw, he was just here.

06:05.657 --> 06:08.368
Daddy, what's this about?
Did Peter screw something up at work?

06:08.452 --> 06:10.829
No, I'm here
because I've got important news.

06:10.913 --> 06:13.624
Lois, everyone, I've left your mother,

06:13.707 --> 06:15.918
and Tricia Takanawa
is moving in with me.

06:16.001 --> 06:17.669
- Holy crap!
- What?

06:17.753 --> 06:19.379
I wanted you to know.

06:19.463 --> 06:20.547
I'm in love.

06:20.714 --> 06:22.799
Well, good for you
for being honest, Carter.

06:22.883 --> 06:26.136
It's never good to keep something
that matters to you a secret.

06:26.220 --> 06:28.472
<i>Tell her about the surf camp</i>
<i>in Belize, Peter.</i>

06:28.555 --> 06:29.556
<i>Tell her you're going.</i>

06:29.681 --> 06:31.141
<i>Tell her it's your dream</i>
<i>and you deserve it.</i>

06:31.225 --> 06:33.143
<i>Tell her it will make you a better father.</i>

06:33.227 --> 06:34.561
What's that, Peter?

06:34.645 --> 06:37.189
Uh, nothing. Just something stupid.

06:55.916 --> 06:58.210
You're leaving Babs for Tricia Takanawa.

06:58.293 --> 06:59.837
And I've never been happier.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.255
What about Mom?

07:01.338 --> 07:03.215
- Where is Mom?
- The sanitarium.

07:03.298 --> 07:05.008
- The sanitarium?
- Yeah.

07:05.092 --> 07:08.011
I told her I was leaving her
and she freaked out for no reason.

07:08.095 --> 07:10.472
And I'll tell you, I don't know why
they call it a sanitarium.

07:10.556 --> 07:12.099
That place is a filthy hellhole.

07:12.307 --> 07:14.309
Oh, my God, that's awful.

07:14.935 --> 07:17.145
Uh, sorry, what did you say?
I was texting Tricia.

07:17.229 --> 07:19.523
She just sent me a picture
of her smoothie.

07:19.606 --> 07:21.692
Looks good, babe.

07:26.280 --> 07:28.031
All right, class, let's get started.

07:28.115 --> 07:30.409
Stewie, what are you doing?
And why are you dressed like that?

07:30.492 --> 07:32.536
Because I'm your
driver's aid instructor, Brian.

07:32.619 --> 07:34.037
- You're what?
- That's right.

07:34.121 --> 07:36.832
I heard you lost your license.
And I'm gonna help you get it back.

07:36.915 --> 07:39.960
- Uh, okay.
- Now, we've got a lot to cover.

07:40.043 --> 07:43.297
But first, let's watch a safety video
designed to terrorize you

07:43.380 --> 07:45.549
into being a responsible motorist.

07:50.846 --> 07:53.015
<i>Come on, kid with a bright future,</i>

07:53.098 --> 07:57.644
<i>I'll give you a no-seatbelt car ride</i>
<i>after this team kegger party.</i>

07:58.020 --> 08:00.772
<i>Oh, I don't know.</i>
<i>I'm going to Harvard Yale tomorrow.</i>

08:00.856 --> 08:03.400
<i>I'd hate to lose it all</i>
<i>because of making poor choices.</i>

08:03.483 --> 08:06.904
<i>Oh, come on, man.</i>
<i>I just had a couple of alcohol beers.</i>

08:06.987 --> 08:10.032
<i>And I'm his girlfriend</i>
<i>'cause he has great genitals.</i>

08:10.115 --> 08:12.409
<i>And I'm impressed with reckless behavior.</i>

08:12.492 --> 08:15.370
<i>So, I'm going to reward him</i>
<i>with my mouth while he's driving.</i>

08:15.454 --> 08:19.875
<i>Now, let's smoke a marijuana cigarette</i>
<i>while I'm speeding because of a dare.</i>

08:19.958 --> 08:23.795
<i>Hey, careful. I'd hate for you</i>
<i>to be unresponsive to my pleasuring</i>

08:23.879 --> 08:26.423
<i>while you're driving</i>
<i>because of intoxication.</i>

08:26.507 --> 08:29.092
Stewie is this about anything
but oral stuff while you're driving?

08:29.176 --> 08:31.345
It's about all facets
of driving safety, yes.

08:31.428 --> 08:33.055
I'm gonna fast-forward.

08:37.809 --> 08:38.894
<i>What a waste.</i>

08:38.977 --> 08:41.271
<i>I'm a grizzled, seen-it-all veteran cop,</i>

08:41.355 --> 08:44.024
<i>and I'm shaking my head</i>
<i>at the senseless waste.</i>

08:44.233 --> 08:45.943
<i>Sir, we've done our police tests.</i>

08:46.026 --> 08:49.321
<i>The driver was being mouth-pleased</i>
<i>at the moment of impact.</i>

08:57.204 --> 09:01.792
Lois, fat-ass, family,
I want you to meet Tricia Takanawa.

09:01.875 --> 09:04.920
Hello, everyone. So happy you came.

09:05.003 --> 09:06.129
Yep. Food's on the table.

09:06.213 --> 09:09.550
And if anyone needs some dirty underpants,
the vending machine's right over there.

09:09.633 --> 09:12.636
How nice. Right where
my mother's china cabinet used to be.

09:12.719 --> 09:15.138
Lois, can I please have a dollar
for the vending machine?

09:15.222 --> 09:18.183
No, Peter. I'm getting our coats.
We're leaving.

09:23.313 --> 09:26.567
<i>No. Bill too crinkly. Try again.</i>

09:28.527 --> 09:31.697
<i>Bill too crinkly. Your dollar funny.</i>

09:32.155 --> 09:34.783
This must be so difficult for you.

09:34.867 --> 09:36.702
It is. There's a lot of choices here.

09:36.785 --> 09:37.953
But I ain't talking to you.

09:38.036 --> 09:40.497
I thought you were supposed to be
doing a news story on Carter,

09:40.581 --> 09:41.874
not shacking up with him.

09:41.999 --> 09:46.545
The truth is, all I ever wanted was to
someday have a family of my own.

09:46.628 --> 09:49.673
And I realized
Carter could give me all of that.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.383
A family all your own?

09:51.466 --> 09:53.802
Yes. A family just like this.

09:53.886 --> 09:56.889
In fact, with a fine son
just like you, Peter.

09:56.972 --> 10:00.601
A son to whom I could, one day,
give a piece of sour plum candy.

10:00.684 --> 10:03.020
Thank you, Mama Tricia.

10:03.103 --> 10:06.481
But a lazy son
who does not make me proud,

10:06.565 --> 10:09.443
Peter, that son deserves no candy.

10:10.944 --> 10:13.030
I swear, Mama Tricia,

10:13.113 --> 10:15.616
I'm gonna make you
the proudest tiger mom of all.

10:15.699 --> 10:17.993
Not like how Jesus feels about his kid.

10:18.285 --> 10:22.039
Dad, I got bullied at school.
They flipped up my lunch tray.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.665
Oh, that sucks.

10:23.749 --> 10:27.252
I wonder if that's the worst thing
that ever happened to a guy.

10:27.336 --> 10:29.379
Whoa. Whoa!

10:29.463 --> 10:33.050
Billy, this guy in this book here,
he's really getting the business.

10:33.133 --> 10:36.553
Yikes. Okay, I'm sorry.
What happened at school today?

10:36.637 --> 10:39.056
- You're kind of a dick, Dad.
- Huh.

10:39.139 --> 10:42.643
I wonder if there is anyone in here
whose dad was a bigger dick.

10:42.726 --> 10:44.686
Wow, crazy.

10:48.815 --> 10:53.195
Uh, Mom, why is Dad over there
playing chess with Tricia Takanawa?

10:53.278 --> 10:57.074
Because, Chris, your idiot father
thinks she's his new tiger mom,

10:57.157 --> 10:58.617
and he's trying to impress her.

10:58.700 --> 11:01.954
All right, Peter,
it's time to master the game of chess.

11:02.037 --> 11:03.872
- Okay, that shouldn't be too hard.
- No.

11:03.956 --> 11:06.333
You will do it
in a traditional Japanese way.

11:06.416 --> 11:08.752
On a wacky game show
while a beautiful woman

11:08.836 --> 11:10.921
beats your scrotum with a reed.

11:11.004 --> 11:13.674
Ow! I don't know
which way the horse goes.

11:15.092 --> 11:16.635
Why is that guy laughing at me?

11:16.718 --> 11:18.095
- And where is he?

11:18.178 --> 11:20.681
There was a time limit?
Nobody told me that.

11:22.015 --> 11:24.434
Time for Good Door, Bad Door.

11:24.518 --> 11:26.812
Wait. How bad is the bad door?

11:29.273 --> 11:32.109
Grandpa-san, how bad was the bad door?

11:32.192 --> 11:36.738
Not too bad. But shortly afterwards,
I was almost eaten alive by an escalator.

11:36.822 --> 11:39.241
- The game is still going on?

11:40.951 --> 11:42.494
You lose chess.

11:47.708 --> 11:50.586
Peter, another way
to impress your Asian tiger mom

11:50.669 --> 11:52.963
is to put on
this old-fashioned baseball hat

11:53.046 --> 11:55.799
and assist Indiana Jones
on his next adventure.

11:55.883 --> 11:57.426
You got it, Mama Tricia.

11:57.634 --> 11:59.595
Okay, nice and slow, Dr. Jones.

11:59.678 --> 12:01.513
More alcohol and pot.

12:01.597 --> 12:03.682
Yeah, let's get you
out of the tub first, Dr. Jones.

12:03.765 --> 12:05.642
I wanna fly an old plane.

12:05.726 --> 12:08.604
- I'm not sure that's a great idea.
- Not a new, safe one.

12:08.687 --> 12:09.897
Uh, yeah. Yeah, I got that.

12:09.980 --> 12:11.982
There's a skeleton
in my bedroom.

12:12.065 --> 12:13.400
That's your wife, Dr. Jones.

12:13.483 --> 12:15.694
Now, maybe today,
we don't do the earring.

12:15.777 --> 12:17.905
No, earring every day.

12:21.533 --> 12:23.994
- All right, Brian. Let's begin.
- Great. Let's do it.

12:24.077 --> 12:27.039
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Stop! Demerit.

12:27.122 --> 12:29.166
- What the hell?
- Where are your hands, Brian?

12:29.249 --> 12:32.211
- Uh, on the steering wheel?
- Ten and two.

12:34.713 --> 12:36.381
All right. Commence.

12:37.925 --> 12:39.927
- IPDE, Brian, IPDE.
- What?

12:40.010 --> 12:43.514
IPDE. Identify, Predict, Decide, Execute.

12:43.597 --> 12:47.059
You've got to constantly be IPDE-ing
everything in your target zone.

12:47.142 --> 12:48.560
I... I don't know what you're saying.

12:48.644 --> 12:51.271
- IPDE. Identify, Predict...
- Yeah, you said that.

12:51.355 --> 12:52.773
- But it doesn't mean...
- IPDE that.

12:52.856 --> 12:55.317
- Uh, it's a child with a ball.
- Very good.

12:55.400 --> 12:57.694
Identified. Now predict.

12:57.778 --> 12:59.196
- Predict what?
- IPDE.

12:59.279 --> 13:00.906
Yeah, you keep saying
that like it's a word.

13:00.989 --> 13:02.616
Those four letters don't make a word.

13:02.699 --> 13:04.243
It's not helping me remember anything.

13:04.326 --> 13:05.911
Oh, now you've got an oncoming vehicle.

13:05.994 --> 13:07.996
Pay attention to your
four to six-second zone.

13:08.080 --> 13:10.040
What... What is that?
Four to six second?

13:10.123 --> 13:12.501
- IPDE the car, Brian, IPDE the car.
- What does that mean?

13:12.584 --> 13:15.838
Now check your gauges with one eye
while keeping your other eye on the road.

13:15.921 --> 13:17.548
My eyes go in the same direction.

13:17.631 --> 13:20.425
- What's your tire pressure?
-I don't... I'm in the car.

13:20.509 --> 13:21.677
Stop! Demerit.

13:21.760 --> 13:24.555
Stewie, I know how to drive.
I've been driving for years.

13:25.973 --> 13:28.267
Ever hear of IPDE, jackass?

13:33.689 --> 13:35.899
I had a great day with the fat son.

13:35.983 --> 13:40.237
He started to respond positively to
the caning of his buttocks and knuckles.

13:40.320 --> 13:43.490
Speaking of buttocks and knuckles,
let's fool around.

13:43.574 --> 13:45.951
Ooh, sounds good.

13:46.034 --> 13:50.539
I wonder if I can tell you
one of my deepest sexual fantasies.

13:50.622 --> 13:52.833
All right. Let me just burp
through my nose for a second.

13:52.916 --> 13:54.418
I've been drinking Seltzer.

13:55.460 --> 13:56.587
Okay, what do you got?

13:56.670 --> 13:58.755
Well, you're going to think this is silly,

13:58.839 --> 14:03.969
but I love it when a man confesses
to manufacturing improprieties.

14:04.052 --> 14:06.889
Oh, yeah?
Well, then you're gonna love this.

14:06.972 --> 14:08.098
I ordered the brewery

14:08.182 --> 14:11.226
to start making beer cans
out of toxic, unsafe metal

14:11.310 --> 14:12.853
just to save a few bucks.

14:12.936 --> 14:16.398
Exactly what I wanted to hear.
Thank you, Carter.

14:17.316 --> 14:20.444
And there you have it,
Channel Five news audience.

14:20.527 --> 14:24.239
This has been Tricia Takanawa
with my undercover exposé

14:24.323 --> 14:26.116
of Pawtucket Patriot Brewery.

14:26.200 --> 14:29.119
Up next, is Papa John dyeing his eyebrows?

14:29.203 --> 14:31.413
I sleep with him to find out,

14:31.496 --> 14:34.333
though I'm fairly confident
the answer is yes.

14:34.499 --> 14:36.001
And we're clear.

14:36.502 --> 14:37.961
What? What's going on?

14:38.045 --> 14:40.172
I finished my investigation.

14:40.255 --> 14:42.257
But I don't understand. I...

14:42.341 --> 14:45.302
- I thought we were in love.
- I only let you think that.

14:45.385 --> 14:47.888
I'm sorry, it's time for me to go.

14:50.891 --> 14:52.851
- Chris?
- Hi, Grandpa.

14:52.935 --> 14:54.478
I got an internship.

14:54.561 --> 14:57.022
You mean you've been working for Tricia?

14:57.105 --> 14:59.733
Hang on. I got to get
20 seconds of room tone.

15:01.568 --> 15:04.404
- What's room tone?
- Oh, we got to start again.

15:11.036 --> 15:12.955
I miss her so much, Griffin.

15:13.288 --> 15:16.041
Of all the women
I've institutionalized Babs over,

15:16.124 --> 15:18.126
she's the one
who meant the most to me.

15:18.210 --> 15:19.211
I know.

15:19.294 --> 15:22.548
It's like one day she's my tiger mom,
and the next day she isn't.

15:22.631 --> 15:25.467
And the day before that first day,
she also wasn't.

15:25.551 --> 15:27.719
But the point is, she hurt us, Carter.

15:27.803 --> 15:29.346
We got to get her back.

15:29.429 --> 15:31.223
We need revenge.

15:33.100 --> 15:34.393
<i>Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker.</i>

15:34.476 --> 15:38.564
<i>Coming up next, Nicki Minaj is a bear?</i>

15:38.647 --> 15:41.984
<i>But first, congratulations</i>
<i>to our very own Tricia Takanawa.</i>

15:42.067 --> 15:43.151
<i>That's right, Tom.</i>

15:43.235 --> 15:45.946
<i>Tricia's recent exposé</i>
<i>on the Pawtucket Patriot Brewery</i>

15:46.029 --> 15:47.739
<i>has been nominated for a local Emmy.</i>

15:47.823 --> 15:49.741
<i>Hmm. The local really hurts that.</i>

15:49.992 --> 15:52.661
That's it, Griffin.
That's how we'll get our revenge.

15:52.744 --> 15:54.538
You and I will go to the Local Emmy's

15:54.621 --> 15:56.415
and we'll embarrass Tricia
on her big night

15:56.498 --> 15:57.749
in front of all her peers.

15:57.833 --> 15:59.251
That's a great idea,

15:59.334 --> 16:02.004
'cause people need to know
that she's an even bigger fraud

16:02.087 --> 16:05.424
than Robert Baden Powell,
the founder of the Boy Scouts.

16:05.507 --> 16:07.759
Ma'am, I'd like to take your son
into the woods.

16:07.843 --> 16:10.137
What? That sounds suspicious.

16:10.220 --> 16:13.307
Well, what if I said we'd both
be wearing shorts and neckerchiefs,

16:13.390 --> 16:16.185
and I'd give him little patches
for doing what I say?

16:23.233 --> 16:25.694
So, how'd we do?
Did you pass your driver's test?

16:25.777 --> 16:28.322
- Uh, yeah. Yeah, I think so.
- You brought up IPDE?

16:28.405 --> 16:30.741
- As a matter of fact, I did.
- He was impressed?

16:30.824 --> 16:32.451
No. He had no idea
what I was talking about.

16:32.534 --> 16:33.911
He tried to Google it on his phone

16:33.994 --> 16:35.913
and ended up spilling hot coffee
on his balls.

16:35.996 --> 16:37.039
I took him to the ER,

16:37.122 --> 16:39.458
and he said he'd pass me
if I picked him up in an hour.

16:39.541 --> 16:40.959
So it did work.

16:41.043 --> 16:43.587
Well, congratulations.
You're getting your license back.

16:43.670 --> 16:44.838
I know. It's great.

16:44.922 --> 16:47.299
Now I'll be able to go
to those dog parties again.

17:14.785 --> 17:15.911
There's Tricia.

17:17.621 --> 17:20.958
- Sweet. What's our plan?
- We put this in her drink.

17:21.041 --> 17:23.919
It'll make her instantly triple herself.

17:24.211 --> 17:28.173
A tripling is when you vomit, defecate,
and orgasm all at the same time.

17:28.257 --> 17:31.677
What? I don't...
Why would that medicine even exist?

17:31.760 --> 17:35.514
Cosby. Now all we need is a distraction
so we can spike her cocktail.

17:35.597 --> 17:37.140
A-ha, you leave that to me.

17:37.224 --> 17:40.352
I know something that might distract
all these news people.

17:40.435 --> 17:43.522
Maybe if one of us just chuckles
for no apparent reason,

17:43.605 --> 17:45.065
everyone else will start chucking.

17:45.148 --> 17:46.233
Worth a shot.

17:55.784 --> 17:58.245
All right, they're all "news chuckling."
Go, go, go.

18:06.336 --> 18:09.047
Okay. All Tricia's got to do now
is take one sip

18:09.131 --> 18:12.176
and she will blow it out of all three
holes right here in front of everyone.

18:12.259 --> 18:15.262
And that will make us feel better
about our life choices.

18:16.513 --> 18:19.766
Hello, Mother, I'm so happy
you could be here tonight.

18:19.850 --> 18:22.227
Why happy?
You no work for Channel Ten.

18:22.311 --> 18:24.479
Just Channel Five. Only half as good.

18:24.563 --> 18:27.065
Mother, please.
I'm being honored tonight.

18:27.149 --> 18:31.403
What honor? Connie Chung marry
Maury Povich for media super team.

18:31.486 --> 18:33.822
Where your Povich? You have no Povich.

18:34.031 --> 18:36.867
Wow, Tricia's mom is
really coming down hard on her.

18:36.950 --> 18:39.953
Yeah. And with
really outdated references.

18:40.037 --> 18:43.624
You know, it's no wonder
Mama Tricia was so tough on me.

18:43.707 --> 18:45.250
It's the only thing she knows.

18:45.334 --> 18:46.793
And where grand children?

18:46.877 --> 18:51.006
Who take care of me when I 121 year old?
Who take care of Irene?

18:51.089 --> 18:53.675
No one. No one take care of Irene.

18:54.051 --> 18:55.636
I guess her name is Irene.

18:55.719 --> 18:58.222
Carter, I'm starting to feel bad
for Tricia.

18:58.305 --> 18:59.765
Maybe what she did to us was wrong,

18:59.848 --> 19:03.018
but sheesh, look at
what her own life has been like.

19:03.101 --> 19:04.811
I don't think I can do this.

19:04.895 --> 19:07.022
Well, this stuff's already in her drink.

19:12.945 --> 19:16.698
Mama Tricia!

19:21.286 --> 19:23.914
No!

19:33.841 --> 19:36.635
Where'd you get these?

19:36.718 --> 19:39.888
Oh, I see the guy.

19:42.933 --> 19:45.519
- You're a weird guy, Griffin.
- Uh, I don't know.

19:45.602 --> 19:46.728
You know, I've just been thinking,

19:46.812 --> 19:50.357
the way you and me fell
so fast for this lady and for no reason,

19:50.440 --> 19:52.609
maybe the problem ain't Tricia, you know.

19:52.693 --> 19:54.403
- Maybe it's us.
- What do you mean?

19:54.695 --> 19:56.446
Well, with my real mom gone,

19:56.530 --> 20:00.742
I guess, maybe I just needed
someone in my life to fill that role.

20:00.826 --> 20:04.204
Someone who loves me enough
to call me fat, and lazy, and stupid.

20:04.496 --> 20:06.665
Hmm, maybe you're right.

20:06.748 --> 20:10.085
And maybe I was just looking for a way
to feel young again.

20:10.210 --> 20:13.839
Hey, Carter, we're gonna be okay.

20:17.718 --> 20:19.928
Oh, crap, this thing was a rental.

20:20.470 --> 20:21.972
Here's your tux back. Bye.

20:25.767 --> 20:29.479
Well, I'm just glad all this nonsense
with Tricia Takanawa is over.

20:29.563 --> 20:31.190
Hey, whatever happened with Grandma?

20:31.273 --> 20:33.192
Yeah, that's what everybody
was thinking about, Meg.

20:33.275 --> 20:35.110
Trust me, she'll come back if we need her.

20:35.194 --> 20:36.361
Hey, Stewie, seriously,

20:36.445 --> 20:38.906
thanks for everything you did
to help me get my license back.

20:38.989 --> 20:41.533
My pleasure. But now, you owe me.

20:41.617 --> 20:44.703
That means one day I'm gonna
come to you and ask for a favor.

20:44.786 --> 20:46.371
But I need to know something.

20:46.455 --> 20:49.833
I need to know that you're gonna
say yes when that day comes.

20:49.917 --> 20:53.128
- Uh, okay.
- Can we go for ice cream?

20:58.217 --> 20:59.468
Come on.
