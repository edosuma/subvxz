00:55.597 --> 00:56.598
[engine stops]

01:30.048 --> 01:31.800
You like your fucking job?

01:33.426 --> 01:34.969
Just shut the door, please.

01:51.694 --> 01:52.612
Okay.

01:54.405 --> 01:56.116
I got the rest of this. Thank you.

02:01.371 --> 02:02.372
[grunts]

02:03.832 --> 02:04.749
Don't.

02:05.416 --> 02:07.293
-[grunts]
-What?

02:10.004 --> 02:13.341
[sighs] You cannot go after Nelson, okay?
You can't go after Helen.

02:13.800 --> 02:17.303
You understand? We can't afford
to lose you, too. You have to promise me.

02:19.222 --> 02:20.682
Wendy should should be here.

02:21.724 --> 02:23.726
Oh, well. We don't have time to wait.

02:23.810 --> 02:26.062
I don't fucking understand any of it.

02:27.021 --> 02:28.106
How'd they find him?

02:29.107 --> 02:31.484
He called Helen. Must've slipped up.

02:31.901 --> 02:33.903
[machine powers on]

02:36.614 --> 02:38.032
Why didn't he call me?

02:39.534 --> 02:40.577
Uh...

02:41.661 --> 02:43.997
I-- You know, I think that he was

02:44.330 --> 02:46.374
probably trying to make things right

02:46.457 --> 02:48.126
so that he could come back.

02:49.002 --> 02:50.587
I don't know. You know?

02:52.046 --> 02:53.840
I know that you loved him.

02:54.299 --> 02:55.466
Um...

02:56.342 --> 02:57.594
You wanna say anything?

03:00.346 --> 03:02.348
[breath trembling]

03:08.855 --> 03:10.190
[door opens]

03:12.901 --> 03:13.943
[door shuts]

03:14.694 --> 03:15.612

04:08.248 --> 04:10.250
[whirring]

04:17.465 --> 04:18.841
[sighs]

04:24.931 --> 04:25.974
[Marty] <i>You okay?</i>

04:40.154 --> 04:41.906
<i>Are you ready to tell me where you are?</i>

04:42.615 --> 04:43.658
[Wendy] <i>No.</i>

04:55.211 --> 04:56.087
[slurps]

04:56.671 --> 04:57.797
We're here,

04:59.048 --> 05:02.260
whenever you want to come home, okay?

05:11.185 --> 05:12.270
<i>The kids love you.</i>

05:14.063 --> 05:15.315
<i>And I love you.</i>

05:22.363 --> 05:24.324
Do you have his ashes? [sniffles]

05:26.826 --> 05:27.702
<i>Yeah.</i>

05:31.831 --> 05:32.957
[sobs] Are they heavy?

05:39.047 --> 05:40.048
Not very.

05:44.427 --> 05:46.429
[sniffling]

06:05.156 --> 06:07.158
[theme music playing]

06:14.957 --> 06:16.959

[shouts]

07:43.671 --> 07:46.007
[screams]

07:55.933 --> 07:57.894
[in English]
I need to get some of my affairs in order.

07:57.977 --> 07:59.020
Of course.

07:59.437 --> 08:01.147
The baby, he's not in the will.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.858
He didn't even have an official name
until yesterday.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.694
[Helen]
I am so sorry about your girlfriend.

08:13.534 --> 08:15.036
We're losing this war.

08:15.912 --> 08:18.247
-These things ebb and flow.
-[grunts]

08:19.081 --> 08:20.082
[Navarro sniffs]

08:24.003 --> 08:27.507
I want you to take the nanny and
the children to America until it is safe.

08:29.675 --> 08:30.760
Of course.

08:31.886 --> 08:34.138
The older boys' inheritance is in a trust

08:34.347 --> 08:35.515
with my ex-wife.

08:38.643 --> 08:41.395
I would like for you to transfer
all of my legitimate assets

08:41.479 --> 08:43.981
equally amongst the three of them,
in their names.

08:44.565 --> 08:45.942
I'll have the papers drawn up.

08:46.025 --> 08:46.859
Good.

08:50.446 --> 08:51.322
What is it?

08:52.823 --> 08:54.450
-Well, if I may.
-Please.

08:56.160 --> 08:57.787
Trusts and estates won't make a difference

08:57.870 --> 09:01.666
if the Byrdes drive your legitimate
businesses into the ground. I could help.

09:03.709 --> 09:04.669
How?

09:05.336 --> 09:06.212
Well, I...

09:06.963 --> 09:10.383
I would like to take control
of all the Byrde Enterprise affairs,

09:10.466 --> 09:14.387
just in case their involvement continues
to prove erratic.

09:24.814 --> 09:26.482
[Wyatt] What are they telling people?

09:30.403 --> 09:32.113
That he went to Knoxville.

09:34.574 --> 09:37.159
Figure out any more about what happened?

09:37.618 --> 09:39.120
Just that he fucked up...

09:41.414 --> 09:42.873
and called Helen.

09:44.625 --> 09:45.793
And then, that...

09:46.127 --> 09:48.629
that fucking robot who shot my dad...

09:49.630 --> 09:51.173
brought the body home.

09:52.508 --> 09:54.802
-[sighs]
-I guess, for Wendy.

09:55.094 --> 09:57.680
I think she's too fucked up
to drive anywhere, so...

09:58.389 --> 10:00.641
So, I don't-- I don't fucking know.

10:05.104 --> 10:07.106
[sighs]

10:07.815 --> 10:10.276
I'm so fucking tired, Wyatt.

10:12.903 --> 10:13.988
I know.

10:35.843 --> 10:38.095
[clears throat] Uh, how's Darlene?

10:42.683 --> 10:44.477
She wants me to meet her mom.

10:44.560 --> 10:45.686
[snorts]

10:47.229 --> 10:50.024
-[sniffles, laughs]
-What?

10:53.819 --> 10:56.656
-Well, that's fucking weird.
-[sputters]

11:00.117 --> 11:04.038
-[sighs] Do you think she'll like me?
-[laughing]

11:09.085 --> 11:10.419
Everybody likes you.

11:31.399 --> 11:32.441
I can't...

11:34.235 --> 11:36.570
I can't make fucking sense of it.

11:40.783 --> 11:43.994
I just think maybe
you should be asking why.

11:48.499 --> 11:49.500
What do you mean?

11:52.044 --> 11:53.212
Well, I think...

11:56.298 --> 11:58.342
I think you should be asking questions.

12:00.010 --> 12:03.723
And I think you shouldn't be afraid
of the answers that you might find.

12:07.727 --> 12:08.561
'Cause...

12:10.229 --> 12:11.897
the guy that I met

12:13.315 --> 12:15.443
was living for you.

12:17.737 --> 12:20.239
And I think that he would have
made it back here.

12:25.244 --> 12:26.829
And I also know that...

12:28.247 --> 12:30.040
when something feels off...

12:32.668 --> 12:34.128
it's probably off.

13:31.894 --> 13:33.938
-Seven out.
-[Sam groans]

13:34.063 --> 13:36.774
Baby, I think that's enough.
It's time to head out.

13:37.107 --> 13:38.317
One more pass.

13:39.193 --> 13:41.695
I have to pee, and the Cardinals
are playing at Milwaukee.

13:41.779 --> 13:44.114
Okay, okay, uh... Can you, um...

13:45.533 --> 13:47.326
Can you just count these for me?

13:53.624 --> 13:55.668
[gasps, shouts]

13:57.044 --> 13:58.712
Is this what I think it is?

13:59.338 --> 14:00.297
Even better.

14:04.134 --> 14:05.261
It's my mom.

14:06.011 --> 14:07.471
It's your mom's? [laughs]

14:08.430 --> 14:09.682
No, my mom,

14:10.224 --> 14:11.892
pressed hard and firm, and...

14:12.643 --> 14:14.728
wrapped around your finger for life.

14:18.691 --> 14:19.775
Try her on.

14:22.278 --> 14:23.445
Sam...

14:24.697 --> 14:25.739
[sighs]

14:27.116 --> 14:28.450
I'm worried about your gambling.

14:28.993 --> 14:30.494
I think you have a problem.

14:31.120 --> 14:32.246
Don't be silly.

14:32.621 --> 14:34.832
It's all you do,
and you're really bad at it.

14:35.624 --> 14:37.543
Well, that's just because
you don't know how it works.

14:39.169 --> 14:41.046
Okay, just don't worry.

14:41.547 --> 14:43.340
I've got everything under control.

14:44.425 --> 14:45.676
Sam Dermody.

14:47.011 --> 14:50.681
You are under arrest on suspicion
of being an accessory to money laundering.

14:51.098 --> 14:52.391
Oh, this is crazy.

14:53.684 --> 14:56.061
[sighs] Sweetie, this is crazy, okay?

14:56.145 --> 14:59.356
-Can she really do this?
-Oh, I can definitely do this.

14:59.440 --> 15:00.482
[Sam sighs]

15:03.319 --> 15:05.321
Just a misunderstanding, okay?

15:08.657 --> 15:10.826
Well, it's a matter
of expediency, really.

15:12.620 --> 15:15.956
If I had time to go through
the proper channels, I would.

15:19.627 --> 15:23.297
What makes you think I can just instantly
get you on a casino license?

15:23.797 --> 15:26.717
The fact that you're willing to come
to my house to take this meeting.

15:30.137 --> 15:31.639
Why? Are you saying you can't?

15:34.558 --> 15:38.687
I believe Marty and Wendy are very close
to losing their hold on the casino.

15:40.606 --> 15:41.941
And why do you think that?

15:42.441 --> 15:44.526
Well, as their attorney,
I can't violate privilege,

15:44.610 --> 15:48.697
but let's just say that I feel certain
that time is of the essence.

15:49.573 --> 15:51.617
I don't just back random power plays.

15:51.784 --> 15:55.204
Nor should you.
You hold 1,5% of the casino profits

15:55.287 --> 15:56.538
as a silent partner,

15:56.997 --> 15:58.999
which, unless I'm misinformed,

15:59.875 --> 16:02.711
is very helpful to prop up the rest
of your businesses.

16:04.546 --> 16:07.257
I don't believe I need to lecture you
on self-interest.

16:10.177 --> 16:12.304
I never saw you as the Ozark type.

16:13.013 --> 16:14.390
We adapt or die.

16:16.517 --> 16:17.810
All right, let's say...

16:20.396 --> 16:23.065
I managed to convince
the gaming commission

16:23.148 --> 16:24.984
to add you to the license.

16:25.401 --> 16:26.986
If that happened,

16:27.236 --> 16:30.864
-plans for a hotel and shopping center--
-Will be very much alive.

16:41.834 --> 16:45.212
Let's not pretend we both don't know
how badly they fucked you over.

16:55.723 --> 16:57.224
I hope you're proud of yourself.

16:57.766 --> 16:59.852
I don't know. Depends. What's the topic?

16:59.935 --> 17:02.104
[sighs] What do you think
your bosses are gonna say

17:02.187 --> 17:04.023
when you gotta release Sam Dermody
in a day

17:04.106 --> 17:06.650
because you don't have enough evidence
to hold him?

17:06.734 --> 17:09.028
I think you're using him to launder money.

17:09.278 --> 17:12.990
Well, I think you're using him
to put pressure on me, you know.

17:13.532 --> 17:17.286
I also think that you no longer care
about who you scare,

17:17.369 --> 17:18.454
who you hurt.

17:18.787 --> 17:20.914
I think that you're Agent Evans.

17:21.331 --> 17:22.332
Or Petty.

17:23.500 --> 17:25.753
I don't think you give a shit about
whose life you destroy

17:25.836 --> 17:28.213
or if the charges are bullshit.

17:29.339 --> 17:31.425
You don't get to be self-righteous
with me.

17:31.508 --> 17:33.761
I mean, it's not against the law
to lose money in a casino.

17:33.844 --> 17:34.887
No, it's not.

17:35.471 --> 17:37.347
Money-laundering, on the other hand...

17:37.431 --> 17:38.557
You took this job...

17:40.434 --> 17:42.686
to do some good. Am I right?

17:42.770 --> 17:47.399
And yet, I have given you
really solid information

17:47.483 --> 17:50.486
about cases that you care about,
and you haven't taken it.

17:50.819 --> 17:52.863
Have you ever stopped to think about why?

17:54.031 --> 17:55.741
I'm not gonna be compromised by you.

17:55.824 --> 17:59.161
It's not about me,
and it shouldn't be about you, either.

17:59.244 --> 18:01.747
You know, it should be about
all of us trying to do

18:01.830 --> 18:04.750
the good that we can do, right now.

18:05.542 --> 18:07.628
Your bosses understand that, you know?

18:07.711 --> 18:09.046
But you think you're above that.

18:09.838 --> 18:12.049
You're dragging Sam off? For what?

18:12.633 --> 18:14.635
You're waiting for the world to change

18:14.718 --> 18:17.179
to fit your pristine belief system,

18:17.262 --> 18:19.264
and it's just never gonna happen.

18:19.640 --> 18:22.893
What will happen is that
you're gonna lose your career, Maya.

18:23.936 --> 18:27.773
But hey, you'll be right.

19:01.557 --> 19:02.432
[woman] Connor!

19:03.559 --> 19:04.434
Connor.

19:05.894 --> 19:06.854
Oh, my God.

19:07.229 --> 19:08.397
There you are.

19:09.189 --> 19:11.275
You can't just walk off like that.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.819
I was losing my mind.

19:14.403 --> 19:15.529
Are you okay?

19:33.881 --> 19:35.549
[engine starts]

19:56.153 --> 19:57.154
[parking brake ratchets]

20:46.328 --> 20:47.412
Mom!

20:49.748 --> 20:50.791
[laughs] Hi.

20:52.334 --> 20:53.377
Hi.

20:59.633 --> 21:02.970
-Hey, sweetheart.
-Are you home for good?

21:08.350 --> 21:09.351
I am.

21:11.144 --> 21:12.562
What are you gonna do about Helen?

21:16.024 --> 21:17.067
What do you mean?

21:17.734 --> 21:19.278
She killed your brother.

21:19.695 --> 21:22.698
Jonah, let's-- let's let Mom get in

21:22.781 --> 21:24.616
and get settled for a moment.

21:25.033 --> 21:26.535
Helen's our partner.

21:28.829 --> 21:30.872
We have no choice but to work with her.

21:32.416 --> 21:35.127
-So we're supposed to forget about Ben?
-[Wendy] Of course not.

21:35.210 --> 21:36.253
Well, then, what?

21:36.336 --> 21:39.423
-[Marty] Let's try to get back to normal.
-[Jonah] "Normal"?!

21:39.923 --> 21:42.175
-Ben's dead!
-[Wendy] Jonah...

21:42.259 --> 21:45.721
Yeah, he's dead. You guys are gonna keep
working with the person who killed him?

21:47.431 --> 21:49.891
We cannot control
who we are partners with.

21:50.642 --> 21:51.852
I hate you.

21:52.936 --> 21:53.979
You don't mean that.

21:54.062 --> 21:57.316
[stammers] No, there's nothing normal
about anything that we do.

21:59.484 --> 22:01.069
And why aren't you saying anything?

22:04.656 --> 22:06.658
[breath trembling]

22:08.577 --> 22:09.661
[door slams shut]

22:49.534 --> 22:51.953
He just needs some time. Okay?

23:01.463 --> 23:02.422
We all do.

23:17.437 --> 23:18.647
[Charlotte sniffles]

23:24.319 --> 23:26.279
What the fuck were you thinking?

23:34.413 --> 23:36.706
-Helen's a murderer.
-I know.

23:40.335 --> 23:41.837
So-- So you just don't care?

23:42.003 --> 23:43.547
Of course I care.

23:44.423 --> 23:47.592
But you can't just yell at mom.
She's devastated.

23:49.761 --> 23:50.595
Good.

23:52.347 --> 23:55.142
You know they can't just magically
make all this go away, right?

24:01.731 --> 24:02.774
I miss him.

24:03.233 --> 24:04.317
I know.

24:06.445 --> 24:09.030
You understand these things
more than I do.

24:10.115 --> 24:12.659
And honestly,
I used to be jealous about it.

24:12.784 --> 24:15.412
But none of this works
if we don't stick together.

24:16.163 --> 24:19.249
[scoffs]
You sued to get out of the family.

24:23.712 --> 24:25.130
Yeah, but I came back.

24:26.631 --> 24:27.966
Maybe you shouldn't have.

24:29.009 --> 24:30.343
Fuck you.

24:36.725 --> 24:37.934
[door slams shut]

24:49.905 --> 24:52.449
[kids laughing, chattering]

24:54.034 --> 24:55.702
When do they go back to Mexico?

24:56.286 --> 24:58.955
Whenever it's safe, you know? Soon, never.

25:00.665 --> 25:02.667
You didn't come home right away.
Where did you go?

25:06.087 --> 25:07.130
Nowhere.

25:08.715 --> 25:10.926
Well, now,
that's an impossibility, isn't it?

25:13.845 --> 25:16.056
I just needed some time to clear my head.

25:17.182 --> 25:18.183
[Helen] And is it?

25:18.850 --> 25:20.936
-Clear?
-[Marty] I think what is clear

25:21.019 --> 25:22.896
is that we are committed

25:22.979 --> 25:25.232
to keeping things
moving forward peacefully.

25:26.650 --> 25:27.734
Is that true?

25:32.447 --> 25:34.115
I'm ready to go back to work.

25:36.826 --> 25:37.911
I'm glad.

25:40.747 --> 25:41.748
Are you?

25:42.332 --> 25:43.208
[Helen] I am.

25:44.417 --> 25:48.171
So, in the spirit of trust...
[clears throat]

25:49.548 --> 25:54.135
...my client wants to diversify control
of his children's assets between us.

25:55.470 --> 25:56.346
Meaning what?

25:56.805 --> 26:00.016
Meaning I would need to become a signatory
in Byrde Enterprises.

26:02.602 --> 26:03.520
Huh.

26:08.483 --> 26:10.360
I would need assurances

26:10.443 --> 26:14.197
that it was just Wendy and I
on the casino licenses.

26:15.115 --> 26:19.077
I have no interest in being
on any casino license.

26:21.079 --> 26:22.247
Then, no issue.

26:23.248 --> 26:25.000
I know how much you've sacrificed.

26:28.003 --> 26:29.462
[Wendy] <i>She's gonna have us killed.</i>

26:29.546 --> 26:31.339
-Don't be crazy.
-I'm not fucking crazy.

26:31.423 --> 26:33.508
-Do not-- Do not call me crazy.
-Okay.

26:33.925 --> 26:35.176
I-- I can feel it.

26:35.343 --> 26:36.970
Tell me why she'd do it.

26:37.053 --> 26:38.430
She doesn't trust me.

26:38.930 --> 26:40.765
Your brother is dead.

26:40.849 --> 26:42.642
You couldn't have made
a bigger sacrifice.

26:42.726 --> 26:44.769
-She even said it.
-She is making moves.

26:44.853 --> 26:47.814
She's doing paperwork
for a stressed-out boss

26:47.897 --> 26:49.858
who almost had
his entire family wiped out.

26:49.941 --> 26:52.068
No, I could hear it in her voice.

26:52.152 --> 26:53.194
You're just upset.

26:53.320 --> 26:56.156
No, she can't believe
that we won't hit back.

26:56.531 --> 26:57.866
I mean, that's what she'd do.

26:57.949 --> 27:02.370
She cannot believe that I don't share
the same warped worldview.

27:02.454 --> 27:04.331
Why don't you just take a couple
of deep breaths?

27:04.414 --> 27:05.874
Let's just-- Come on.

27:05.957 --> 27:08.501
I am telling you,
she's going to have us killed.

27:10.920 --> 27:11.880
I'm positive.

27:16.676 --> 27:18.011
You wanna get out in front of it?

27:18.094 --> 27:21.306
We tell Navarro
the sacrifice that we made for him.

27:21.389 --> 27:24.434
We make sure that she doesn't poison
our loyalty with him.

27:27.520 --> 27:28.355
You want me to do it?

27:29.022 --> 27:29.898
No.

27:32.108 --> 27:33.318
It needs to be me.

27:38.823 --> 27:40.033
[cell phone vibrating]

27:48.083 --> 27:49.125
Wendy Byrde.

27:52.087 --> 27:55.799
I just wanted to call
and say I am so sorry

27:56.675 --> 27:57.884
about your girlfriend.

27:59.427 --> 28:00.512
Thank you.

28:00.929 --> 28:04.265
<i>I saw your children at Helen's.</i>
<i>They look well.</i>

28:07.185 --> 28:09.229
Why are you really calling me, Wendy?

28:13.108 --> 28:14.359
Something happened...

28:17.612 --> 28:19.155
and we thought you should know.

28:20.949 --> 28:22.075
<i>Well, I'm listening.</i>

28:25.662 --> 28:26.663
My brother,

28:27.831 --> 28:30.250
Ben, was staying with us, and...

28:32.001 --> 28:35.255
he saw Marty be abducted
when he went down to Mexico.

28:37.340 --> 28:40.677
We tried to shield him
from the reality of our situation,

28:40.760 --> 28:42.470
but he knew too much.

28:46.057 --> 28:47.016
<i>And?</i>

28:49.644 --> 28:52.063
My brother had issues with mental illness.

28:53.648 --> 28:55.483
He could be a real wild card,

28:56.443 --> 28:59.112
<i>and we thought he was a danger</i>
<i>to your operation.</i>

29:03.533 --> 29:05.201
And so, you had him killed.

29:07.370 --> 29:08.329
[voice breaks] Yes.

29:11.416 --> 29:14.377
<i>And now you want me to know</i>
<i>that you're loyal to me?</i>

29:17.464 --> 29:18.423
[sniffles]

29:21.718 --> 29:22.594
I do.

29:24.471 --> 29:25.388
[sighs]

29:26.931 --> 29:29.184
What do you expect from me, Wendy, huh?

29:30.059 --> 29:31.603
You want me to throw my arms around you?

29:31.686 --> 29:34.439
Hold you close to my heart,
like your blood is my blood?

29:39.360 --> 29:41.196
I wanted you to hear it from me.

29:42.655 --> 29:44.282
And we thought you should know.

29:45.909 --> 29:47.327
<i>You did what was required.</i>

29:48.328 --> 29:50.246
Don't act like I should be grateful.

29:51.581 --> 29:53.583
[line disconnects]

29:55.710 --> 29:56.836
[door opens]

29:58.004 --> 30:00.048
[Ruth]
I need to know what happened to Ben.

30:00.131 --> 30:02.675
-[Marty] I told you--
-No, I wanna hear it from Wendy.

30:08.097 --> 30:09.599
[Wendy] They tracked us down on the road.

30:10.517 --> 30:13.228
I don't know-- I don't know how.
I mean, maybe Ben said something.

30:14.729 --> 30:17.148
All I know is that Helen's man...

30:19.192 --> 30:21.152
Helen's man showed up,
he pointed a gun at Ben,

30:21.236 --> 30:23.112
and told him to get into the SUV.

30:25.490 --> 30:26.783
In front of witnesses?

30:32.080 --> 30:33.498
It was empty.

30:35.250 --> 30:36.584
That's convenient.

30:39.462 --> 30:41.464
I don't know what you want from me.

30:42.841 --> 30:45.510
I want you to stop lying

30:45.593 --> 30:48.137
and tell me why Ben is dead.

30:48.930 --> 30:52.016
[Wendy] He's dead because
you got him out of the hospital,

30:52.141 --> 30:53.434
where he was safe.

30:54.018 --> 30:56.938
He's dead because you thought
you knew him better

30:57.021 --> 31:00.525
after two fucking months
than I did after his whole life!

31:00.942 --> 31:01.776
[Marty] Wendy.

31:02.735 --> 31:05.071
You fucking murdered him.

31:05.488 --> 31:07.991
I begged you not to get involved with him.

31:11.703 --> 31:14.163
You know about this, hmm?

31:19.252 --> 31:20.920
Your own fucking brother.

31:21.004 --> 31:23.798
Don't you look at me
with that blame in your face.

31:24.257 --> 31:26.551
I've spent my whole life protecting him!

31:26.634 --> 31:28.011
This is yours.

31:28.720 --> 31:30.096
You did this.

31:31.723 --> 31:33.558
Did you watch him die?

31:34.058 --> 31:37.854
Or were you too chickenshit,
like with my dad?

31:42.692 --> 31:44.777
We dragged you out of that trailer.

31:45.945 --> 31:47.864
We brought you into our family,

31:47.947 --> 31:50.700
and you are still too dumb
to listen to us.

31:55.872 --> 31:56.915
[sniffles]

32:02.378 --> 32:04.130
I fucking quit.

32:04.839 --> 32:07.008
[Wendy] 'Cause everything is
somebody else's fault?

32:07.425 --> 32:08.885
What about your uncles?

32:08.968 --> 32:11.846
Is that somebody else's fault, too,
or did you actually murder them?

32:11.971 --> 32:13.723
Wait, we're all saying things
we don't mean.

32:13.806 --> 32:17.143
No, I'm fucking done!
I'm fucking done, Marty.

32:19.062 --> 32:21.481
Well, you don't get to quit a drug cartel.

32:21.564 --> 32:24.609
What the fuck are you gonna do?

32:25.443 --> 32:26.486
Kill me?

32:26.945 --> 32:29.030
You fucking bitch wolf.

32:31.866 --> 32:34.202
I said I'm fucking done.

32:42.126 --> 32:43.044
Ruth.

32:43.795 --> 32:46.631
Ruth, come on.
Don't do this. We can work this out.

32:46.714 --> 32:49.133
I'm grateful for everything
you've done for me,

32:49.217 --> 32:50.843
but I'm not your daughter.

32:50.927 --> 32:53.471
I don't have to stay in your shit!

32:54.389 --> 32:56.641
[engine starts, revs]

32:56.724 --> 32:59.560
[tires screech]

33:18.329 --> 33:19.539
[Wendy sobbing]

33:21.582 --> 33:23.042
I can't do this anymore.

33:41.310 --> 33:42.311
[Wendy sighs]

33:46.941 --> 33:48.609
[Marty exhales] Okay.

33:56.034 --> 33:57.702
What do we do? You wanna run?

33:58.327 --> 34:00.830
You wanna... You wanna take the deal?

34:00.913 --> 34:02.331
You tell me what you need.

34:10.757 --> 34:13.051
Everything I've done,
I've done for nothing.

34:19.015 --> 34:20.433
The kids are alive.

34:22.935 --> 34:24.145
And they love us,

34:24.812 --> 34:26.064
against all odds.

34:30.610 --> 34:31.986
When we were at the restaurant,

34:32.070 --> 34:35.490
I asked Ben what he wanted
out of the next five years.

34:38.785 --> 34:40.495
Why would I do that?

34:40.578 --> 34:42.538
-Honey. Come on.
-[sniffling]

34:42.622 --> 34:44.916
I had already made the phone call.

34:44.999 --> 34:46.417
Don't do this to yourself.

34:46.501 --> 34:50.088
[huffs]
We were four hours away from Knoxville.

34:50.171 --> 34:51.923
-Listen...
-[sniffles]

34:53.132 --> 34:56.094
You'd be dead if we didn't do what we did.

34:56.177 --> 34:57.178
So would I.

34:59.013 --> 35:01.265
Jonah would be dead,
Charlotte would be dead.

35:04.435 --> 35:06.562
Those are just things we tell ourselves.

35:07.396 --> 35:10.441
-No, no. That's...
-[exhales, sniffles]

35:11.275 --> 35:13.861
That's the truth.
You know, that's our truth, honey.

35:23.162 --> 35:25.373
Do you ever think about the baby we lost?

35:29.627 --> 35:31.254
-[sighs]
-No.

35:32.296 --> 35:33.131
Hmm.

35:38.136 --> 35:40.096
Jonah would have been a middle child.

35:43.266 --> 35:44.559
I wonder...

35:46.727 --> 35:50.106
I wonder if he'd be so curious
about the world, or if...

35:51.315 --> 35:54.318
if all of his attention would have gone
to that baby, and...

35:56.237 --> 35:57.488
And Charlotte...

36:00.116 --> 36:02.577
She would have had to become
more responsible.

36:02.702 --> 36:03.661
Wendy...

36:06.164 --> 36:07.248
[Wendy sighs]

36:07.999 --> 36:09.292
You cannot disappear.

36:10.376 --> 36:12.753
Do you hear me?
I'm not gonna let that happen.

36:14.714 --> 36:15.631
Okay?

36:17.216 --> 36:18.301
You were right.

36:20.636 --> 36:22.054
When you wanted to run.

36:23.723 --> 36:26.601
Mnh-mnh. No, I wasn't.
We never would have been safe.

36:26.684 --> 36:27.560
[Wendy sniffles]

36:29.979 --> 36:31.522
I need you to get out of bed.

36:33.482 --> 36:35.443
Come on. You came back for a reason.

36:38.779 --> 36:40.239
I ran out of vodka.

36:45.620 --> 36:47.246
-I'm serious.
-So am I.

36:47.830 --> 36:48.789
Come on.

36:55.713 --> 36:57.215
What the hell are we gonna do?

37:05.139 --> 37:07.600
We can launder money
for a Mexican drug cartel.

37:12.021 --> 37:13.147
That's not funny.

37:13.648 --> 37:15.566
Your plan was right.

37:16.150 --> 37:18.569
Our security is tied to Navarro.

37:19.487 --> 37:20.988
We give him a future,

37:21.072 --> 37:22.156
he gives us a future.

37:22.240 --> 37:25.618
We just need to burrow right
into the center of this thing.

37:25.701 --> 37:27.828
[Wendy whimpers]

37:30.581 --> 37:31.999
[Marty] We can do that.

37:32.583 --> 37:34.126
And you made it possible.

37:35.002 --> 37:37.171
I just need you to get out of bed, honey.

38:00.236 --> 38:02.697
I wanted you to hear it
from my fucking mouth.

38:02.780 --> 38:04.407
I quit Marty and Wendy.

38:05.116 --> 38:07.535
You've taken a fucking lot from me,

38:07.618 --> 38:09.203
but I don't got beef with you.

38:09.620 --> 38:10.955
I don't want anything,

38:11.038 --> 38:13.165
I'm not coming after anybody,

38:13.416 --> 38:15.042
and I ain't a fucking rat.

38:16.794 --> 38:17.962
I'm just fucking done.

38:22.800 --> 38:24.593
If Marty and Wendy
were out of the picture,

38:24.677 --> 38:26.595
would you consider coming back to work?

38:31.642 --> 38:32.768
I ain't hard to find.

38:41.110 --> 38:43.696
[Darlene] <i>Do you really think</i>
<i>she's breaking with the Byrdes?</i>

38:45.740 --> 38:47.700
I don't see how she could stay.

38:50.036 --> 38:51.329
Because of the brother?

38:53.706 --> 38:55.624
And 'cause when she got beat up,

38:57.710 --> 38:59.670
she was supposed to be untouchable,

38:59.754 --> 39:03.549
but they refused to do anything
to Frank Jr., you know,

39:03.632 --> 39:05.843
even though he almost killed her.<i> </i>[scoffs]

39:07.762 --> 39:09.180
Oh, Jesus.

39:10.931 --> 39:13.184
What's wrong with these fucking people?

39:59.480 --> 40:01.482
[brushing teeth]

40:12.827 --> 40:13.702

41:06.046 --> 41:07.173
I was just wondering,

41:07.256 --> 41:11.135
is reason you like to beat up women
'cause you got a tiny dick?

41:11.218 --> 41:12.720
I don't know what you're talking about.

41:12.803 --> 41:13.762
-Where the hell is it?
-Ah!

41:13.846 --> 41:16.265
-[Frank Jr.] Lady, I don't even know you.
-Oh! There we go.

41:16.682 --> 41:19.226
Jesus. You pick your dog's teeth
with that thing?

41:19.935 --> 41:23.647
[grunts] No. Okay, okay, okay, I get it.
You're talking about Ruth.

41:23.772 --> 41:26.734
So, you remember
how you beat the hell out of her.

41:27.443 --> 41:29.945
-How did that make you feel?
-Sorry.

41:30.821 --> 41:32.615
I'm so sorry that I hurt her.

41:33.908 --> 41:34.825
Good.

41:35.576 --> 41:36.494

41:49.507 --> 41:51.800
-[Wendy] <i>Hey.</i>
-You didn't hear this from me.

41:53.093 --> 41:54.053
<i>Okay.</i>

41:55.721 --> 41:59.099
Helen Pierce is being issued
an expedited casino license

41:59.183 --> 42:01.227
on behalf of Byrde Enterprises.

42:04.813 --> 42:05.773
Fuck.

42:07.942 --> 42:09.652
<i>I take it you didn't know.</i>

42:12.988 --> 42:14.114
Are you positive?

42:14.448 --> 42:15.407
<i>Yeah.</i>

42:15.699 --> 42:19.453
If there's any discord in your ranks,

42:20.120 --> 42:22.706
I suggest you proceed very cautiously.

42:26.710 --> 42:27.711
Thank you, Jim.

42:30.172 --> 42:31.507
Everything all right?

42:34.677 --> 42:35.803
It's happening.

42:36.262 --> 42:38.931
Helen's on the casino license.
She's moving against us.

42:44.270 --> 42:48.107
And if she manages
to break Navarro's faith in us...

42:49.942 --> 42:51.026
What? We're dead?

42:52.027 --> 42:55.447
No. We would not let that happen, honey.

42:55.573 --> 42:58.200
She could say anything
to turn him against us.

42:58.284 --> 43:00.286
Everything about the man is on edge.

43:00.369 --> 43:01.453
I could hear it.

43:03.747 --> 43:06.667
We've gotta find a way
to be more valuable to him.

43:08.335 --> 43:11.338
Well, we got him a casino, and I wash
his money. What more could we do?

43:13.215 --> 43:16.844
We could volunteer to take his kids in.

43:19.013 --> 43:20.681
-Helen would fight that.
-Well...

43:21.432 --> 43:22.891
we have children here.

43:23.225 --> 43:25.603
Helen doesn't.
His kids would have other children.

43:25.686 --> 43:26.854
It would be a real home.

43:26.937 --> 43:30.024
The man is in a war,
and he doesn't trust us.

43:30.107 --> 43:31.859
He's not gonna give us his kids.

43:35.738 --> 43:38.282
Then we end the fucking war for him.

43:39.742 --> 43:41.201
Oh, yeah? Just like that?

43:42.286 --> 43:43.412
Maya said it.

43:44.747 --> 43:47.750
If a drug cartel commits violence
on US soil,

43:47.833 --> 43:50.586
the government sends troops in response.

43:51.003 --> 43:52.338
-The Lagunas cartel--
-That was--

43:52.421 --> 43:55.049
No, they killed those Cosgrove men.

43:55.924 --> 43:59.303
If we give that information to Maya,
then troops will roll on Lagunas.

43:59.386 --> 44:02.848
Do you think that she's gonna take my word
for it, that it was Lagunas?

44:06.018 --> 44:07.227
Jonah has video.

44:14.068 --> 44:15.152
[Navarro] <i>What?</i>

44:17.321 --> 44:18.489
[Wendy] <i>Marty did it.</i>

44:18.947 --> 44:20.532
<i>The FBI's on board.</i>

44:21.158 --> 44:22.034
How?

44:24.244 --> 44:25.371
They are...

44:25.788 --> 44:27.581
Well, they're ready
to push the US military

44:27.665 --> 44:30.000
to intervene against the Lagunas cartel.

44:31.710 --> 44:33.128
But first, uh...

44:35.839 --> 44:37.049
<i>Well, what is it, Wendy?</i>

44:39.510 --> 44:41.261
I'd like to ask for some assurances.

44:42.930 --> 44:44.306
You don't make demands.

44:44.390 --> 44:47.518
<i>Oh, no. It's-- It's not a demand.</i>

44:48.102 --> 44:50.729
<i>Just a-- Just a request.</i>

44:51.063 --> 44:53.482
<i>Just to make all of our lives easier.</i>

44:54.525 --> 44:58.362
<i>If-- If we help end this war,</i>

44:58.445 --> 45:00.114
we would like to request...

45:02.950 --> 45:05.536
that Helen is out
of any Byrde Enterprise business.

45:10.624 --> 45:12.960
I'll handle my business
the way that I choose.

45:18.382 --> 45:19.299
[clears throat]

45:25.723 --> 45:26.890
[Jonah] What's going on?

45:28.142 --> 45:30.561
[Charlotte] They're trying to make sure
Helen doesn't kill us.

45:43.449 --> 45:46.160
You're telling me
Marty Byrde is willing to stipulate

45:46.243 --> 45:49.204
that he launders money
for the Navarro drug cartel?

45:49.288 --> 45:51.331
In exchange for him
and his family being placed

45:51.415 --> 45:53.792
in the Federal Witness
Protection Program, correct.

45:54.918 --> 45:58.714
After turning down the offer at least
a half-dozen times over the past year?

45:58.797 --> 46:00.632
Well, I can only speak to his mindset now.

46:01.341 --> 46:02.760
[scoffs]

46:06.722 --> 46:10.225
I'll need a copy of that confession
on FBI letterhead

46:10.309 --> 46:11.977
in order for my client to sign.

46:13.312 --> 46:15.606
[Marty]
I ran these through recognition software,

46:15.689 --> 46:18.358
and they were all rented
at a Hertz in St. Louis

46:18.442 --> 46:21.987
by a company called Bennett Industrial,
which if you explore a little bit further,

46:22.070 --> 46:24.239
is a subsidiary of Ventrex Capital,

46:24.656 --> 46:26.200
which has headquarters in Panama

46:26.283 --> 46:28.911
and whose bank records hit a dead end

46:28.994 --> 46:30.412
until you pierce the shield,

46:30.496 --> 46:33.373
at a company that is known only
by that number.

46:35.459 --> 46:37.795
If you give that number
to the Bureau's task force,

46:37.878 --> 46:40.672
I guarantee you they're gonna find
that it is a shell company

46:40.756 --> 46:42.800
for the Lagunas cartel.

46:46.845 --> 46:48.222
How'd you get this footage?

46:49.598 --> 46:50.849
An anonymous tip.

46:51.225 --> 46:55.062
And you're not concerned
about your own conflict of interest?

46:56.438 --> 46:57.898
What conflict is that?

47:00.234 --> 47:01.735
We both know who your boss is.

47:02.820 --> 47:05.239
How can you work for Navarro

47:05.322 --> 47:09.535
and represent Marty Byrde
in his attempt to testify against Navarro?

47:10.369 --> 47:12.704
My conflicts aren't FBI business

47:13.247 --> 47:15.249
any more than your conflicts are mine.

47:16.416 --> 47:18.877
Does your prior relationship
with Agent Petty get in the way

47:18.961 --> 47:21.338
of you fulfilling your obligations
in this case?

47:24.842 --> 47:26.885
I'd like that confession before I leave.

47:27.177 --> 47:28.428
[Maya] <i>Why are there only stills?</i>

47:29.388 --> 47:30.889
I don't know. It's all I was given.

47:33.267 --> 47:36.937
If I saw the full video
and it wasn't cropped,

47:37.813 --> 47:40.732
would I see Ruth Langmore's truck
parked right here?

47:43.735 --> 47:47.364
American citizens were killed on US soil
by the Lagunas cartel.

47:47.447 --> 47:49.700
This is proof. This is good for the world.

47:50.617 --> 47:51.952
It's good for Navarro.

47:53.203 --> 47:56.164
Maya, you don't get this information
to your bosses, you're gonna get fired.

47:58.333 --> 47:59.501
I'll think about it.

48:00.669 --> 48:01.712
Okay.

48:10.178 --> 48:12.514
I need this acted on, immediately.

48:15.058 --> 48:17.227
If it's not, my family's gonna get killed.

48:22.441 --> 48:23.650
I said I'll think about it.

the business. I'll teach you.

49:55.575 --> 49:56.618
And besides,

49:57.119 --> 49:59.663
it's about time both of you
understood the value

49:59.746 --> 50:02.499
of people from here

50:04.918 --> 50:06.003
I'm sorry.

your back on what's come before.

50:20.142 --> 50:21.184
I know.

50:22.936 --> 50:24.146
I figured you did.

50:28.233 --> 50:30.360
You really shot his dick off?

50:31.737 --> 50:34.197
Took a minute to find it first.

It's yours, 50/50 split.

51:58.532 --> 52:01.493
I also talked to a community developer

about plans to build
three new opioid treatment centers,

52:05.789 --> 52:08.625

I did have your uncle killed,
because it had to be done,

all of our lives. That is true.

Uh, but...

You need to understand something.

No. You're lying.

where they were,

because she couldn't face you

55:53.767 --> 55:58.271
But you know that your mom did this.

55:59.022 --> 56:01.274
And that's why you want me
to stop talking.

56:05.528 --> 56:07.030
I'm sorry about your uncle.

56:08.323 --> 56:09.366
I really am.

56:10.533 --> 56:14.079
And I am so sorry that you are
in this mess.

56:14.746 --> 56:15.872
And I am...

56:17.332 --> 56:20.126
I'm sorry about Erin. I'm sorry about...

56:21.002 --> 56:22.087
[sighs]

56:22.837 --> 56:23.922
...so many things.

56:25.840 --> 56:27.634
But none of that changes the truth.

56:36.309 --> 56:37.310
Now...

56:40.730 --> 56:41.815
I am...

56:42.732 --> 56:44.150
going to stand up now.

56:45.985 --> 56:47.028
And I'm...

56:48.238 --> 56:49.739
going to go upstairs

56:50.740 --> 56:52.325
and get these kids ready

56:53.368 --> 56:55.161
to be reunited with their dad.

57:08.091 --> 57:10.093
[panting]

57:28.278 --> 57:30.155
How long are you gonna be gone for?

57:30.238 --> 57:31.656
Uh, I don't know. Not long.

57:32.240 --> 57:35.702
Everything's fine. Really.
Just keep an eye on Jonah.

57:35.785 --> 57:37.454
He needs some support.

57:37.537 --> 57:40.957
This is for Buddy's mausoleum.
Remember, increments of ten grand.

57:41.040 --> 57:43.126
-Make sure they lose by nine each day.
-Make sure they...

57:43.209 --> 57:45.003
-Rotate them every three days.
-Exactly. Thank you.

57:45.086 --> 57:46.254
Don't worry, I got it.

57:49.757 --> 57:50.800
I'm proud of you.

57:57.223 --> 57:58.892
[engine starts]

58:16.409 --> 58:17.660
[Wyatt] What do you think?

58:24.542 --> 58:26.252
I think it's fucking beautiful.

58:50.860 --> 58:52.737
You're taking a goddamn deal?

58:53.488 --> 58:56.449
Uh, what are you talking about?

58:57.075 --> 58:59.702
<i>My boss just told me</i>
<i>you're testifying against Navarro</i>

58:59.786 --> 59:01.371
<i>in exchange for witness protection.</i>

59:01.788 --> 59:04.082
Why would you take that deal
and not mine?

59:04.874 --> 59:07.085
<i>Are you scared of prison time?</i>
<i>Is this Wendy?</i>

59:09.837 --> 59:12.757
Uh, that is not true.

59:12.840 --> 59:15.343
I'm-- I'm not doing what they're saying.

59:16.761 --> 59:19.389
Okay, good. Blood pressure down.

59:19.472 --> 59:22.559
But you need to get yourself in here
right now and clear this up.

59:23.685 --> 59:24.978
I can't do that.

59:25.353 --> 59:26.479
<i>You have to.</i>

59:27.230 --> 59:28.690
<i>They typed up your statement.</i>

59:28.773 --> 59:31.442
<i>You do not want</i>
<i>false information leaking out.</i>

59:32.068 --> 59:34.279
Well, I'm about to get on a jet.

59:37.031 --> 59:38.658
Is that jet going to Mexico?

59:39.909 --> 59:40.868
<i>Marty.</i>

59:42.620 --> 59:46.332
<i>Marty, if that jet is going to Mexico,</i>
<i>do not get on.</i>

59:46.791 --> 59:47.792
Um...

59:48.918 --> 59:50.503
Thank you for the warning.

Welcome.

Thank you for coming, I...

1:03:05.239 --> 1:03:06.282
