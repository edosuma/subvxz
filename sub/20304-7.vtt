WEBVTT

00:01.042 --> 00:03.294
NARRATOR:<i> In the last episode</i>
<i>of </i>Hill Street Blues...

00:03.378 --> 00:05.005
It's gonna be all right, Joyce.
It's gonna be all right.

00:05.088 --> 00:06.548
-Leo, call an ambulance.
-(clamoring)

00:07.549 --> 00:09.342
-Money in the bank.
-Why? What happened?

00:09.718 --> 00:10.635
Whiplash.

00:10.719 --> 00:13.179
-Let me hear some numbers.
-Six thousand.

00:13.263 --> 00:16.224
-I'm growing a boil.
-Then let's go get it lanced.

00:16.516 --> 00:18.893
You're high, ain't you, Mizell?
Yeah, you're using.

00:19.978 --> 00:21.855
How'd you hurt your neck, LaRue?
Banging your head against the wall

00:21.938 --> 00:23.606
in your nowhere job
in your nowhere precinct?

00:23.690 --> 00:24.566
Let him go, man.

00:24.649 --> 00:26.526
Still Mr. Personality, aren't you, Mizell?

00:26.860 --> 00:28.403
Still on the Hill, aren't you, Furillo?

00:28.486 --> 00:30.864
-(grunts) Come on!
-You're sick!

00:30.947 --> 00:33.742
Pollack, let him go! Pollack!

00:34.075 --> 00:35.994
You heard about
the fight he had with LaRue?

00:37.037 --> 00:39.080
I want J.D. brought in for questioning.

00:40.373 --> 00:43.209
NARRATOR:<i> And now,</i>
<i>tonight on </i>Hill Street Blues.

00:43.293 --> 00:44.794
Two gunshots, one serious.

00:44.878 --> 00:47.380
I could have saved him.
I may have botched it.

00:47.464 --> 00:50.300
I don't think maybe you know
what it is you're saying here.

00:50.383 --> 00:55.138
The only person further out in the cold
on the Mizell case than I am is Mizell.

00:55.221 --> 00:56.639
What the hell's going on here?

00:56.723 --> 00:59.601
Guys like Daniels and Detweiler
make their careers

00:59.684 --> 01:02.187
on the backs of middle-level grunts
like you and me.

01:02.270 --> 01:05.273
I did my training. I did my service.

01:05.607 --> 01:06.566
A lot of people did.

01:06.649 --> 01:08.401
-In 'Nam?
-Yeah.

01:08.485 --> 01:09.861
How many people you shoot?

01:10.361 --> 01:13.531
-Can't you just lance it or something?
-I suppose I could try.

01:14.157 --> 01:16.284
-This might hurt a little.
-Oh, no.

01:16.367 --> 01:17.410
COFFEY: What's the beef?

01:17.494 --> 01:20.371
Guy's got eight people
and half a dozen weapons in there.

01:20.455 --> 01:22.207
-(police siren wailing)
-HOWARD: This is the police.

01:22.290 --> 01:24.334
Surrender yourself now,
and we'll consider this

01:24.417 --> 01:26.586
nothing more
than a minor misunderstanding.

01:29.756 --> 01:31.424
(people chattering)

01:31.508 --> 01:35.428
A personal aside, uh,
<i>en passant, </i>people...

01:35.970 --> 01:37.931
or gentlemen, I should say.

01:38.598 --> 01:40.683
If a mere one-tenth of the rumors
I've heard are true,

01:40.767 --> 01:42.894
last night's bachelor festivities...

01:42.977 --> 01:45.939
-(all murmuring)
-...at the Club Como charted new frontiers

01:46.022 --> 01:50.151
for bizarre off-duty behavior
intoxication-wise,

01:50.235 --> 01:53.279
interpersonal relation-wise and otherwise.

01:53.363 --> 01:56.032
In particular, those portions
of the evening's program

01:56.116 --> 01:59.953
which included, among other things,
green felt,<i> femmes de pauvres,</i>

02:00.036 --> 02:02.956
tire irons, and which, unfortunately,

02:03.039 --> 02:05.416
carried over to a nearby
public thoroughfare.

02:06.543 --> 02:08.753
At minimum, guys, next time...

02:09.087 --> 02:11.464
let's take it off the Hill, shall we?

02:11.548 --> 02:15.885
Uh, additionally, people,
with regards to events of last night,

02:17.053 --> 02:22.100
it appears that we've got a make
on a '75 Grand Prix, four-door,

02:22.183 --> 02:25.937
black on maroon, license:
Baker, Donald, Uncle, 737.

02:27.021 --> 02:29.774
This vehicle was observed
departing the Mizell homicide

02:29.858 --> 02:31.901
-at time and place of occurrence.
-(all groan)

02:31.985 --> 02:37.115
The observer, a civic-minded
street princess known as Chantelle.

02:37.198 --> 02:39.033
-(all murmuring)
-(man whistles)

02:39.117 --> 02:42.787
In so far as said vehicle
is registered not to J.D. LaRue,

02:42.871 --> 02:45.415
but rather to one James Feeny,

02:45.498 --> 02:48.626
also known as Jimmy Feeny,
also known as Jimbo,

02:48.710 --> 02:50.879
also known as Jimmy "The Nose" Flaherty.

02:50.962 --> 02:55.216
-(all laugh)
-Also known as Procaine James.

02:55.300 --> 02:57.969
May I remind you that although, uh,

02:58.052 --> 03:00.430
Detective Stanley Mizell
may never have won

03:00.513 --> 03:02.348
a popularity contest in this department,

03:02.432 --> 03:05.602
and although I personally,
when he was assigned up here in '78,

03:05.685 --> 03:08.313
felt obliged on one occasion to, uh,

03:08.771 --> 03:11.149
somewhat modify his orthodonture--

03:11.232 --> 03:12.609
-MAN: You too?
-(all laugh)

03:12.692 --> 03:15.570
Nevertheless, he was a police officer,

03:15.653 --> 03:18.323
and he was slain in the line of duty.

03:18.823 --> 03:19.949
In which further regard,

03:20.033 --> 03:22.368
the family has established
a memorial fund.

03:23.870 --> 03:25.455
Contributions are invited.

03:26.206 --> 03:29.792
Hey, next time Chantelle takes a bust,

03:30.043 --> 03:31.419
let's remember we owe her one, huh?

03:31.502 --> 03:34.631
-(all murmuring)
-MAN: All right! Yeah.

03:34.714 --> 03:37.467
Item 14, a new undercover operation

03:37.550 --> 03:40.220
will commence today
in the vicinity of Waverly Alley

03:40.303 --> 03:42.972
with Detective Belker undercover
to investigate

03:43.056 --> 03:46.768
the recent rash of auto-related
personal injury scams

03:46.851 --> 03:48.603
being perpetrated in the vicinity.

03:48.686 --> 03:51.731
The M.O. of said scams
involving, among other things,

03:51.814 --> 03:57.195
the recruitment of various Waverly
vagrants by an unknown consortium

03:57.278 --> 04:01.074
for pratfalls against the fenders
of unsuspecting and passing motorists,

04:01.157 --> 04:06.204
resulting in false injuries, fraudulent
medical examinations, doctored X-rays,

04:06.287 --> 04:11.834
consequent liability suits, and, often,
substantial out-of-court settlements.

04:11.918 --> 04:13.294
(all groaning, murmuring)

04:13.378 --> 04:16.506
Supporting roles in this investigation
are to be provided by

04:17.257 --> 04:21.511
Sergeant Henry Goldblume
and Officers Hill and Renko.

04:21.594 --> 04:25.556
The latter hopefully
cognizant of the, uh, fact

04:25.640 --> 04:30.979
that in acting, particularly,
less is oftentimes more.

04:31.062 --> 04:32.981
(all laugh)

04:34.107 --> 04:36.401
All right, that's it. Let's roll.

04:36.651 --> 04:39.821
And let's be careful out there.

04:42.282 --> 04:44.200
(telephone ringing)

04:44.284 --> 04:46.119
Can you believe
this Stan Mizell Memorial Fund?

04:46.202 --> 04:47.996
Yeah. The guy was my partner
for five months.

04:48.079 --> 04:49.330
He never paid for one haircut,

04:49.414 --> 04:51.457
one meal, one suit of clothes
the whole time he was here.

04:51.541 --> 04:54.252
The first week I'm in South Ferry,
I'm in the ladies room washin' up.

04:54.335 --> 04:56.796
Mizell pops out of a stall
and cops a feel.

04:56.879 --> 04:59.257
Then he got what he deserved... death.

05:01.092 --> 05:02.218
Oh, Captain, Captain.

05:02.302 --> 05:05.722
Look, about last night,
the party and then afterwards outside--

05:05.805 --> 05:06.764
I heard about it, J.D.

05:06.848 --> 05:07.932
I may not like what happened,

05:08.016 --> 05:10.935
but I don't blame you
specifically on any level.

05:11.019 --> 05:12.770
Work on Feeny this morning,
anything you can get.

05:12.854 --> 05:14.897
Right. Thanks, Captain.

05:16.357 --> 05:20.153
(grunts) Next time I send you out
for pipe tobacco, Ballantine,

05:20.236 --> 05:22.864
could you try to avoid
the Bulgarian brands?

05:22.947 --> 05:26.075
The clerk said Boris, Prince of Krum,
was excellent, sir.

05:26.159 --> 05:27.327
(groans, spits)

05:28.661 --> 05:31.039
Oh, Frank, I've been hearing a rumor

05:31.122 --> 05:34.876
of prostitutes on premises
at the Club Como last night.

05:34.959 --> 05:36.544
There was also a cop murder last night.

05:36.627 --> 05:38.296
Which would you have me
attend to first, Howard?

05:38.379 --> 05:41.132
(scoffs) Just issue
a gol-darn memo, Frank.

05:41.716 --> 05:43.301
When the need arises, men,

05:43.384 --> 05:47.221
move ten dollars
from one pocket to the other, and, uh...

05:47.847 --> 05:48.765
What?

05:49.557 --> 05:52.352
Judas Priest, man,
how do you spell relief?

05:52.935 --> 05:54.812
Frank. Frank.

05:55.188 --> 05:58.191
Chief Daniels wants to see you
and Jerry Fuchs on the Mizell homicide.

05:58.274 --> 06:00.193
-Division?
-He's coming here.

06:09.410 --> 06:11.329
Anybody belong to this apple juice?

06:12.705 --> 06:13.623
Henry?

06:23.216 --> 06:25.093
Yuck! (groans)

06:25.802 --> 06:27.720
Oh, is that wretched.

06:28.805 --> 06:30.098
It must have fermented.

06:31.057 --> 06:32.975
Ooh! Ew!

06:34.936 --> 06:36.020
MAN: Morning, Howard.

06:44.737 --> 06:46.531
All right, who's the joker?

06:48.199 --> 06:49.242
Where is it?

06:50.159 --> 06:52.537
I gotta be at the urologist's
in half an hour.

06:55.832 --> 06:59.168
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

06:59.252 --> 07:00.420
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

07:00.503 --> 07:04.424
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

07:04.507 --> 07:06.008
(sirens wailing)

07:11.472 --> 07:15.393
(theme music playing)

08:46.359 --> 08:48.569
Frank, I'm instructing you
to keep Jerry apprised

08:48.653 --> 08:50.738
at every phase of this investigation.

08:50.821 --> 08:53.324
Mizell was Special Narcotics,
so that's only fair.

08:53.407 --> 08:55.159
At the same time, Jerry,

08:55.243 --> 08:57.703
I want you to cooperate fully with Frank.

08:58.287 --> 09:00.373
I'll need his files, all his 347s.

09:00.706 --> 09:03.584
-Anything he needs, understood?
-Understood.

09:04.377 --> 09:05.545
That'll do it, gentlemen.

09:06.879 --> 09:08.839
-HOWARD: Oh, Frank...
-(door opens)

09:08.923 --> 09:11.259
...just 30 seconds of your time
on a different matter.

09:12.051 --> 09:13.928
You don't have to bother with this, Jerry.

09:19.600 --> 09:21.394
Forget every word I just said.

09:21.477 --> 09:24.355
-Fuchs gets nothing on this case.
-What?

09:24.438 --> 09:26.232
I don't want him involved, Frank.

09:26.315 --> 09:30.486
A homicide took place on the Hill,
and it is your job to take care of it.

09:31.362 --> 09:34.824
We just spent 20 minutes talking
about full and open communication.

09:34.907 --> 09:36.450
Don't you think that's
gonna be a little awkward?

09:36.534 --> 09:37.994
Captain Fuchs's hindquarters

09:38.077 --> 09:40.037
are flapping in the breeze
on this one, Frank.

09:40.121 --> 09:42.623
Under the circumstances,
it would hardly be appropriate

09:42.707 --> 09:44.959
to let him anywhere
near this investigation.

09:45.042 --> 09:46.335
What are you talking about?

09:46.877 --> 09:48.421
-(papers rustling)
-This, for openers

09:49.505 --> 09:50.673
Your eyes only, Frank.

09:51.257 --> 09:53.342
A copy of Mizell's autopsy report.

09:53.426 --> 09:55.761
Barbiturates, Percodan, cocaine...

09:56.637 --> 09:58.764
and every other damn thing in his body.

09:59.181 --> 10:01.392
The man had a raging case of gonorrhea.

10:02.560 --> 10:05.646
We're gonna be burying some very dirty
blue underwear tomorrow, Frank.

10:06.564 --> 10:08.858
I've worked with Fuchs for 12 years.

10:08.941 --> 10:12.278
He's a decent cop and a friend.
I'd rather not work behind his back now.

10:12.361 --> 10:14.614
There's a key in there too. Safe deposit.

10:15.031 --> 10:16.073
Run it down.

10:18.492 --> 10:21.996
Not everyone's as happy in their
occupational niche as you are, Frank.

10:22.663 --> 10:23.497
Meaning?

10:24.540 --> 10:28.127
Meaning, I've been watching Jerry Fuchs
operate for a year and a half now.

10:28.878 --> 10:32.548
Regular little empire he's building
over there in Special Narcotics.

10:32.965 --> 10:36.344
I like a man who's ambitious, Frank,
as long as he's a team player.

10:36.677 --> 10:40.056
But Fuchs has been carrying on
like he's not answerable to anyone.

10:42.933 --> 10:45.436
Maybe it's time for us
to bring him down a peg or two.

10:51.567 --> 10:53.152
Tell the truth. Is he after me?

10:54.695 --> 10:55.988
He's after me, isn't he?

10:57.031 --> 10:59.950
I mean, if he said I was ambitious,
he's gotta be after me, right?

11:00.034 --> 11:01.952
Is there something you should
be telling me right now

11:02.036 --> 11:03.329
that I don't know about, Jer?

11:04.330 --> 11:07.708
I swear on my mother, Frank,
I was gonna bring Mizell in.

11:08.042 --> 11:09.710
Didn't I tell you that last night?

11:10.544 --> 11:12.922
In the alley, didn't I? I said two weeks.

11:15.049 --> 11:17.218
I need all that stuff, Jer.
When can you get it to me?

11:18.594 --> 11:20.388
I gotta think this one out, Frank.

11:20.888 --> 11:23.057
If he's after me,
I gotta play it the same way.

11:23.140 --> 11:24.892
-I gotta protect myself.
-From what?

11:26.185 --> 11:28.771
Frank, we've been friends a long time.

11:28.854 --> 11:30.439
I gotta wrestle with the angel
on a couple of things.

11:30.523 --> 11:31.565
Not good enough, Jerry.

11:32.983 --> 11:34.193
Six o'clock then.

11:34.902 --> 11:36.112
Hey, six o'clock.

11:36.195 --> 11:39.115
It's gonna take me half that long
just to get everything together.

11:40.658 --> 11:43.661
You're asking me as a friend.
As a friend, sure, okay.

11:43.744 --> 11:45.454
But you better stay straight with me.

11:45.955 --> 11:48.290
If you're sitting on something,
I'm gonna find out about it anyway,

11:48.374 --> 11:49.583
so you may as well tell me now.

11:50.334 --> 11:54.505
Six o'clock, Frank.
I got some choices I gotta make.

12:07.017 --> 12:08.018
What do you want?

12:08.352 --> 12:09.812
COFFEY: We have a complaint
about noise, sir.

12:09.895 --> 12:11.188
Could you open the door?

12:12.857 --> 12:14.859
(locks clanking)

12:15.484 --> 12:19.947
I've had a noise complaint since 1969.
You the man I see about that?

12:20.030 --> 12:22.450
You make him go to work. Make him go!

12:29.707 --> 12:32.251
The counselors get him jobs.

12:32.543 --> 12:33.669
He don't go.

12:35.045 --> 12:38.424
He's got screamin' in his ears. Okay.

12:40.050 --> 12:41.051
But then...

12:41.385 --> 12:44.764
She won't even go to her own work.
She got a good job.

12:45.347 --> 12:47.224
Yet she'll mind my business.

12:47.725 --> 12:50.519
Like $1.75 an hour gonna help.

12:52.021 --> 12:54.482
Like a grown man gonna pack boxes.

12:55.149 --> 12:56.942
That a job for a grown man?

12:57.026 --> 12:59.987
WOMAN: It's a training program!

13:00.863 --> 13:02.990
Some people don't understand!

13:03.073 --> 13:06.160
I did my training. I did my service.

13:06.744 --> 13:07.953
A lot of people did.

13:09.079 --> 13:09.997
You?

13:10.915 --> 13:11.749
Yeah.

13:13.459 --> 13:14.627
In 'Nam?

13:15.377 --> 13:16.504
Yeah.

13:19.965 --> 13:23.302
-How many people you shoot?
-That's none of your business.

13:25.054 --> 13:26.806
-What's your problem, man?
-Nothin'.

13:28.432 --> 13:29.266
Nothin'.

13:29.600 --> 13:32.895
He was such a wonderful young man,

13:32.978 --> 13:35.439
just happy all the time, you know?

13:37.316 --> 13:40.027
Then he went over there,
and when he came back...

13:40.110 --> 13:40.945
Mm.

13:42.321 --> 13:44.824
It's like he couldn't do anything anymore.

13:45.741 --> 13:47.159
He couldn't sleep.

13:47.827 --> 13:49.787
He got bad dreams.

13:51.080 --> 13:52.957
He's gettin' violent.

13:54.708 --> 13:57.837
(stutters) He started goin'
for therapy over at the VA.

14:00.673 --> 14:02.800
But it was like too much had happened,

14:04.593 --> 14:05.427
or...

14:07.054 --> 14:08.597
I don't know.

14:10.349 --> 14:13.811
Nine years, he still gets the flashbacks.

14:16.647 --> 14:19.233
He goes over to the VA, but, uh...

14:23.153 --> 14:25.948
Seems like nobody can help Vernon.

14:29.243 --> 14:32.288
And he's so ashamed.

14:34.164 --> 14:36.208
Ashamed I see him this way...

14:39.378 --> 14:41.839
ashamed he's no man anymore.

14:43.841 --> 14:45.676
Look, if it means anything,

14:46.385 --> 14:49.430
when I got back,
I laid on my bed for three weeks.

14:50.472 --> 14:52.016
-I just--
-Three weeks?

14:53.267 --> 14:56.186
That the gospel? Twenty-one days?

14:56.687 --> 14:58.230
Yeah, it was driving me crazy.

14:58.981 --> 15:01.483
You know, people, buddies,

15:01.567 --> 15:03.652
everybody wantin' to ask
a lot of questions.

15:04.445 --> 15:06.864
I didn't want to talk to anybody,
so I just stayed in the house.

15:08.282 --> 15:09.199
Then I figured...

15:09.658 --> 15:12.077
it didn't mean anything, Vietnam.

15:12.953 --> 15:14.538
You just have to walk away from it.

15:20.085 --> 15:23.339
Look, this is not something
for the police.

15:32.973 --> 15:34.350
Try to get along.

15:48.447 --> 15:49.281
(door closes)

15:49.365 --> 15:51.367
(siren wailing)

15:53.577 --> 15:55.537
(siren wailing continues)

15:59.917 --> 16:01.835
(tires screech)

16:01.919 --> 16:03.003
(horn honks)

16:07.841 --> 16:09.677
-You're hurtin' my arm!
-I'll break your arm!

16:09.760 --> 16:11.261
Bobby, come on!
I got the store owner in the back.

16:11.345 --> 16:13.097
He's bleedin' to death. Get him in here!

16:16.392 --> 16:18.102
You move, and you're dead!

16:20.604 --> 16:22.439
(tires screech)

16:25.526 --> 16:27.111
Two gunshots! One serious!

16:27.403 --> 16:29.363
Get him into OR. Get Dr. Sweeney.

16:29.446 --> 16:31.115
D5 lactated ringers.

16:31.198 --> 16:34.410
Type and cross-match
six units of whole blood. Go!

16:34.493 --> 16:36.578
-Watch it, man. That hurt!
-I ain't gonna watch nothin' man.

16:36.662 --> 16:38.497
Don't bother about him.
He don't mind bleedin'.

16:38.580 --> 16:40.416
-The gunshot victim is hemorrhaging.
-Right.

16:40.499 --> 16:41.917
Hey, that's an intern.

16:42.001 --> 16:46.922
Dr. Tanzer and Dr. Leonard are in surgery.
Please get him in there, please.

16:47.006 --> 16:49.466
-Dr. Sweeney can handle it.
-Watch it, man. This hurts!

16:49.550 --> 16:51.135
Sit down and be quiet.

16:52.386 --> 16:53.595
(groans)

16:54.596 --> 16:57.683
Oh, man. You know, while you're at it,
you ought to just grab somebody

16:57.766 --> 16:59.852
and get that little fella
on your tushy reamed.

16:59.935 --> 17:01.687
Oh, I can manage, Renko.

17:01.770 --> 17:04.314
What, are you savin' it or something?
We're in a hospital.

17:04.398 --> 17:05.858
I'm busy, they're busy.

17:06.650 --> 17:08.444
Hey, Doc, would you take a look
at my partner for a second?

17:08.527 --> 17:12.072
He has a work-related ailment
sort of operating on one hemisphere.

17:12.156 --> 17:12.990
Renko!

17:13.073 --> 17:16.076
Sorry, but I'm not officially
on duty at the moment.

17:16.160 --> 17:17.661
One of our city's finest, Doc.

17:17.745 --> 17:21.373
Just risked his life
in a shoot-out of tremendous proportions.

17:21.457 --> 17:24.209
-Oh, man.
-Uh, well, if he's a police officer.

17:24.293 --> 17:26.253
Could you step this way, please?

17:26.336 --> 17:28.547
WOMAN (on P.A.)
<i>Dr. Webner, call the operator.</i>

17:29.006 --> 17:30.466
(Hill grunts)

17:35.596 --> 17:36.513
Oh, my!

17:38.849 --> 17:40.684
I've never seen one like it before.

17:41.226 --> 17:43.103
Well, can't you just lance it
or somethin'?

17:43.187 --> 17:45.064
Oh, my. Um...

17:45.564 --> 17:47.024
-No, it's too early.
-(groans)

17:47.107 --> 17:48.233
You'll have to wait another day at least.

17:48.317 --> 17:50.652
Oh, no, Doc, no.

17:51.361 --> 17:54.698
Please, can't you just do anything?
I'd really appreciate it.

17:54.782 --> 17:58.869
Well, um, yeah, I...
I suppose I could try.

18:01.663 --> 18:03.874
-This might hurt a little.
-Just do it.

18:06.960 --> 18:09.505
Oh, there you are, Mr. Sybert.

18:09.880 --> 18:11.965
You know, Dr. Schimmer has been
looking all over for these.

18:12.049 --> 18:15.552
-I'm very busy at the moment, nurse.
-Yes, I can see that.

18:15.636 --> 18:18.764
Susan is going to take you
back up to the fifth floor

18:18.847 --> 18:20.140
where they're gonna give you some Jell-O.

18:20.224 --> 18:21.683
You don't want to miss Jell-O.

18:21.767 --> 18:23.393
Okay, but then
I'll have to feed the ducks.

18:23.477 --> 18:24.353
Right.

18:25.479 --> 18:27.481
Hey, who is that guy? Isn't he a doctor?

18:27.856 --> 18:29.191
Oh, my.

18:30.567 --> 18:33.529
Oh, my. That is rather horrid.

18:36.615 --> 18:37.658
Did you get it fixed?

18:37.741 --> 18:41.036
Nah. Maybe tomorrow. It's not ready.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.454
What is that thing?

18:43.122 --> 18:45.082
What do you think it is? I sit on it.

18:47.376 --> 18:48.460
I lost him.

18:49.002 --> 18:51.505
Well, he was in bad shape, Doc.
It wasn't your fault.

18:51.588 --> 18:53.882
-I'm not so sure about that.
-What?

18:53.966 --> 18:55.467
I should have stopped
the carotid bleeding.

18:55.551 --> 18:56.802
-I don't know what--
-Sir...

18:57.136 --> 18:59.972
I don't think you know
what it is you're sayin' here.

19:00.973 --> 19:03.600
I could've saved him.
I may have botched it.

19:05.185 --> 19:06.228
Now, look here, Doc,

19:06.311 --> 19:08.772
you're broaching serious
issues of proximate cause here.

19:08.856 --> 19:11.400
We all know it was this piece of garbage
that killed him.

19:11.483 --> 19:12.359
Come here.

19:13.235 --> 19:17.781
Now, see, if people think
it was some kind of a medical accident,

19:17.865 --> 19:19.032
and some lawyer hears about it,

19:19.116 --> 19:21.243
this guy could get off in 18 months
on assault.

19:21.326 --> 19:23.162
But if we write it up DOA,

19:23.245 --> 19:26.290
we solve all kinds of problems
and tell the truth besides.

19:27.541 --> 19:30.252
Officer, what you just suggested...

19:30.335 --> 19:33.130
comes under the heading
of criminally fraudulent filing,

19:33.213 --> 19:35.382
which happens to be
a felony in this state.

19:36.633 --> 19:38.260
You're needed in Treatment, Sweeney.

19:41.680 --> 19:44.433
As for you, what's your name?

19:45.184 --> 19:46.268
Renko.

19:46.351 --> 19:49.479
Well, Officer Renko,
your captain will be hearing from me.

19:55.861 --> 19:58.947
MAN: And, uh, you make a cool
40 bucks for your trouble.

19:59.031 --> 20:01.533
Look, it's the simplest thing
in the world, pal.

20:01.617 --> 20:03.785
You stumble in front of a late-model car.

20:03.869 --> 20:06.371
You fall down and scream
like your back is broken.

20:06.455 --> 20:07.539
They come and cart you off

20:07.623 --> 20:10.626
to a doctor friend of mine
for a five-minute examination.

20:10.709 --> 20:14.922
-I'll do it.
-Beat it. Mind your own business.

20:15.172 --> 20:16.256
I'm sorry.

20:17.090 --> 20:19.718
(stutters) I don't mean to seem
out of line, or nothin', mister,

20:19.801 --> 20:21.929
but I couldn't help
overhearing your proposition.

20:22.012 --> 20:23.055
I said, beat it.

20:24.306 --> 20:27.726
I even got a trick shoulder.
It pushes right out of the socket.

20:27.809 --> 20:29.686
I'm just what you're lookin' for.

20:29.770 --> 20:32.189
(scoffs) You're too short.

20:32.773 --> 20:35.525
-Big guy makes a better splash.
-MAN: Oh, yeah?

20:35.901 --> 20:37.736
(grunting)

20:40.405 --> 20:42.991
(groaning)

20:53.210 --> 20:54.378
I like that.

20:55.837 --> 20:57.214
You do auditions.

20:57.631 --> 21:00.008
Hey, what about me?

21:04.429 --> 21:06.139
Here. Here's a couple quarters.

21:06.223 --> 21:07.224
Go kill yourself.

21:18.402 --> 21:20.279
(chuckles) Hey!

21:20.362 --> 21:23.323
(grunting)

21:23.407 --> 21:27.035
-(sneezes)
-You thing! You filth!

21:27.786 --> 21:30.414
-FAY: Yech!
-Fay?

21:32.082 --> 21:34.543
-Anything wrong?
-My best pair of boots

21:34.626 --> 21:36.920
just got saluted
by one of your wine stewards.

21:37.004 --> 21:39.214
Uh-huh. It's part of the terrain.

21:40.340 --> 21:42.342
Why don't you go in the ladies' room
and clean them off?

21:42.843 --> 21:44.720
I've been in your ladies' room before.

21:47.848 --> 21:50.225
-Here.
-(sighs)

21:50.517 --> 21:53.520
-What's that?
-My article on Jon Gennaro.

21:53.603 --> 21:54.563
So soon?

21:55.605 --> 21:57.566
I'm so mad, Frank, I could spit.

21:57.649 --> 22:00.610
"The inside story of Gennaro's death wish.
Was it drugs or suicide?"

22:00.694 --> 22:03.113
-Oh, my God.
-By Fay Furillo.

22:03.196 --> 22:05.240
They did a hatchet job on me, Frank.

22:05.615 --> 22:08.118
I mean, everything I wrote,
they turned it around.

22:08.201 --> 22:12.497
They made Jon look like
some sort of crazed, masochistic weirdo.

22:12.581 --> 22:16.460
I mean, it's lurid,
and it's distorted, and I'm gonna sue.

22:16.543 --> 22:19.629
You didn't know what they do to feature
articles in this kind of publication?

22:19.713 --> 22:21.423
No, I didn't.

22:21.965 --> 22:26.803
I mean, I wrote a very sensitive,
humane article about a great actor.

22:26.887 --> 22:29.514
They turned it
into a first-rate sleaze job.

22:29.973 --> 22:33.852
(sighs) I am a journalist.
I'm not a ghoul.

22:34.311 --> 22:36.021
Well, next time you'll be wiser.

22:37.230 --> 22:38.815
If there is a next time.

22:39.608 --> 22:43.070
You know, Gennaro's estate could sue me.

22:46.281 --> 22:47.449
It's happened.

22:50.911 --> 22:52.037
-Thanks.
-Oh.

23:01.171 --> 23:02.923
Yes. And 7:30.

23:04.466 --> 23:08.970
Mrs. Furillo, I was, um, I,
I was just looking for John LaRue.

23:09.054 --> 23:10.305
I accept.

23:11.431 --> 23:12.349
You accept?

23:12.432 --> 23:14.726
You wanted drinks and dinner,
you got drinks and dinner.

23:14.810 --> 23:15.936
Is 7:30 good for you?

23:17.354 --> 23:20.732
-Tonight?
-Read that. We'll talk about it later.

23:20.816 --> 23:22.567
(typewriter clacking)

23:23.485 --> 23:24.903
-Hello, Fay.
-Hi, Ray.

23:26.571 --> 23:27.572
Did you see that?

23:29.157 --> 23:31.576
I'll bet you a 20
I park in her garage tonight.

23:34.371 --> 23:37.749
MAN: I want my lawyer.
The cuffs are on too tight!

23:38.250 --> 23:40.460
-I want my lawyer!
-I'll be right there, Leo.

23:40.544 --> 23:44.256
Freaks! Communists! Robots!

23:44.589 --> 23:46.550
We picked up the car
in the Mizell shooting.

23:46.633 --> 23:48.552
He was in it with a police .38.

23:48.969 --> 23:50.887
-Name's James Feeny.
-He cop to anything?

23:50.971 --> 23:53.432
He's got four words. "I want my lawyer."

23:53.515 --> 23:56.017
-Car impounded, pistol going to the lab?
-Covered on that, Captain.

23:56.101 --> 23:57.853
-Get a search warrant on his home address.
-Got it.

23:57.936 --> 23:59.479
Oh. First call Jerry Fuchs.

23:59.563 --> 24:01.022
-I want him posted on this.
-All right.

24:01.106 --> 24:04.151
Al, I had the brace off
in front of 20 people,

24:04.234 --> 24:05.861
and I was dukin' with the guy.

24:05.944 --> 24:09.322
Under the most extreme form
of provocatory duress.

24:09.823 --> 24:10.657
No, no, no.

24:10.740 --> 24:14.411
All I see here is a possible supplementary
suit against Mizell's estate.

24:14.494 --> 24:15.495
No, no. I'm thinkin', man,

24:15.579 --> 24:17.831
I'm thinkin' we should settle
on the whiplash and run.

24:17.914 --> 24:22.043
John. John, you have never
been in a stronger position.

24:22.127 --> 24:25.755
Hey, you didn't just return a former
luxury car to your brother-in-law.

24:25.839 --> 24:27.382
The veins in his neck
were throbbin' so hard,

24:27.466 --> 24:29.259
I thought he was gonna pitch an embolism.

24:29.342 --> 24:30.760
(sighs)

24:31.094 --> 24:34.306
If I'm lucky, the guy sues me.
Otherwise, he breaks my legs.

24:34.681 --> 24:35.974
I mean, I can't blame him.

24:36.266 --> 24:39.603
He loans me some beautiful wheels.
They come back junk.

24:40.020 --> 24:42.606
The doctor diagnoses
an overheated imagination

24:42.689 --> 24:45.859
caused by acute financial difficulties.

24:47.277 --> 24:49.196
-You short of cash, John?
-(chuckles)

24:49.279 --> 24:50.614
-Hmm?
-(sighs)

24:50.697 --> 24:54.451
Would, um, a thousand dollars
help you out?

24:55.785 --> 24:58.622
Oh, hey. Hey, Al, uh,
I-- I couldn't. I mean--

24:58.705 --> 25:00.999
Come on, now. It's absolutely routine.

25:01.291 --> 25:03.293
It's an advance against
your settlement, hmm?

25:04.586 --> 25:08.924
I mean, you pay a...
a nominal rate of interest.

25:09.382 --> 25:11.176
Uh, what kind of rate?

25:11.259 --> 25:13.637
Ah, a couple of points a week.

25:15.764 --> 25:16.640
Not to worry.

25:19.976 --> 25:21.520
A man with a gun in a bar.

25:21.603 --> 25:23.980
101 Santa Fe Avenue. Possible hostages.

25:24.064 --> 25:25.690
Hey, Pepitone, Garcia.

25:25.774 --> 25:28.109
Coffey, Bates,
see Lieutenant Hunter at the scene.

25:28.652 --> 25:29.569
Let's go, Luce.

25:30.570 --> 25:32.447
(police sirens wailing)

25:32.531 --> 25:33.740
COFFEY: What's the beef?

25:34.115 --> 25:37.285
Some guy's got eight people,
and about half a dozen weapons in there.

25:38.078 --> 25:39.079
He's mad at somebody.

25:45.919 --> 25:48.630
You in there, this is the police.

25:48.964 --> 25:50.131
Surrender yourself now

25:50.215 --> 25:53.260
and we'll consider this nothing more
than a minor misunderstanding.

25:53.885 --> 25:56.012
If you should insist
on continuing, however,

25:56.096 --> 25:59.349
I cannot be responsible
for the immediate consequences.

26:01.393 --> 26:03.270
(helicopter blade whirring)

26:12.654 --> 26:13.697
You want us?

26:14.906 --> 26:16.825
Hey, you want us?

26:17.450 --> 26:19.786
Then just come on in!

26:24.291 --> 26:27.752
Deploy Casey on the overpass.
I want Charles on that roof over there.

26:27.836 --> 26:31.381
Put Lytel and Beckwith,
uh, over there by those side windows.

26:31.464 --> 26:33.008
I want Peterson around the back.

26:33.425 --> 26:36.303
-Any response, Joe?
-He's still not picking up, Lieutenant.

26:39.472 --> 26:40.640
I understand you and Bates

26:40.724 --> 26:43.268
had an encounter with this character
several hours ago.

26:43.351 --> 26:45.061
What sort of profile can you give me?

26:45.770 --> 26:46.813
The guy's a vet, sir,

26:46.896 --> 26:49.316
and he's got a lot of problems
left over from the war.

26:49.399 --> 26:50.650
Judas, man!

26:50.734 --> 26:54.279
The last planeload left that peninsula
nearly a decade ago.

26:56.156 --> 26:58.074
Let's deal with present tangibles,
shall we?

26:58.158 --> 27:02.120
Howard, this is Ray Saunders
from the South Side Veteran's Center.

27:02.370 --> 27:03.913
He's Tucker's counselor.

27:03.997 --> 27:06.791
No chance for a clean shot, sir,
not without goin' in.

27:07.125 --> 27:09.669
A shot? Isn't that a little premature,
Lieutenant?

27:11.254 --> 27:13.757
There are eight innocent people
in there with him, Saunders.

27:13.840 --> 27:15.091
What do you think their answer would be?

27:16.051 --> 27:18.470
Look, I've had over 400 hours of sessions
with Tucker, Lieutenant.

27:18.553 --> 27:21.723
Believe me, the only person
he'll hurt in there is himself.

27:24.142 --> 27:28.188
Alessi, I want you out in back
with Peterson. Now!

27:28.813 --> 27:29.814
Let me talk to him.

27:32.192 --> 27:33.443
He'll answer me.

27:36.571 --> 27:37.947
(sighs)

27:39.324 --> 27:40.575
Start dialing, Coffey.

27:50.418 --> 27:51.670
This is Ray, Vernon.

27:52.754 --> 27:54.130
I gotta talk to you, man.

27:57.592 --> 27:58.551
COFFEY: It's ringing.

27:59.052 --> 28:00.637
We can work this out, Vernon.

28:05.058 --> 28:05.892
(phone ringing)

28:05.975 --> 28:08.436
RAY (on megaphone): Pick up the phone,
<i>Vernon. Let's talk about it.</i>

28:09.270 --> 28:11.731
-(phone ringing continues)
<i>-Pick up the phone, man.</i>

28:15.777 --> 28:18.780
<i>I gotta talk to you, Vernon.</i>
<i>Can you hear me, Vernon?</i>

28:23.952 --> 28:26.830
There's a nothin' to talk about, Saunders.

28:27.288 --> 28:30.125
Talk to me, Vernon.
Tell me what you need, man.

28:30.417 --> 28:35.130
I need 20 cops bustin' in here
with rifles, counselor.

28:36.631 --> 28:40.468
I need someone to kill the screamin'
in my head, man.

28:51.479 --> 28:54.232
OFFICER: He rang off, Captain.
Yes, hold on.

28:55.191 --> 28:57.152
Got a patch-in from the captain, Howard.

28:58.111 --> 28:59.237
MAN: Stay back.

29:09.122 --> 29:12.167
Yes, I'm aware of that, Howard.
Chesley's already apprised me.

29:13.084 --> 29:14.753
No, I won't authorize it. Not yet.

29:17.172 --> 29:18.423
Have you sent for his wife?

29:20.884 --> 29:23.094
Well, we'll just have to
take that risk, won't we?

29:24.262 --> 29:25.847
Get her. Yeah.

29:27.599 --> 29:28.433
Yeah.

29:29.225 --> 29:30.602
Right.

29:42.489 --> 29:45.325
I trust you had a productive session
with your client, Ms. Currin.

29:45.408 --> 29:46.743
Yes, thank you, Captain.

29:46.826 --> 29:48.870
I take it that means
he's consented to plea.

29:50.079 --> 29:50.997
Not exactly.

29:53.666 --> 29:56.836
You're aware that we've placed Feeny
at the scene of the shooting.

29:57.212 --> 29:59.255
-Yeah, I am.
-In addition to which,

29:59.339 --> 30:01.841
Ballistics has positively ID'd the piece

30:01.925 --> 30:03.760
found at his residence
as the one that got Mizell.

30:04.928 --> 30:07.680
Your client doesn't have a hell
of a lot of leverage going in,

30:07.764 --> 30:10.225
so if you're gonna deal,
I'd do it while you still can.

30:14.103 --> 30:17.524
Strictly off the record, okay, Captain?
Strictly off the record?

30:18.107 --> 30:20.443
I admit my client was at the scene.

30:20.985 --> 30:23.738
I even admit
he was involved in the incident,

30:24.864 --> 30:27.116
but strictly as a matter of self-defense.

30:27.200 --> 30:28.785
But there are other dynamics
involved in this.

30:28.868 --> 30:30.078
Other dynamics?

30:30.954 --> 30:33.206
Well, we'll hash it all out later
with the D.A.

30:33.289 --> 30:34.457
What the hell's going on here?

30:34.874 --> 30:38.920
I gotta make a court date. Captain.

30:42.340 --> 30:44.968
-Ray, get me Daniels.
-His office just called.

30:45.802 --> 30:49.639
They said the D.A. would be over at 5:00
to talk about the, uh, Mizell homicide.

30:50.014 --> 30:52.141
-Call him right back.
-All right.

30:55.311 --> 30:57.605
My, aren't we looking
a little testy today?

30:57.689 --> 31:00.066
-What are you doing up here?
-Duty calls,

31:00.149 --> 31:03.987
incarnated as a 15-year-old rape artist
with three priors.

31:04.487 --> 31:05.989
Joyce, you just got out of the hospital.

31:06.072 --> 31:08.783
I admire devotion to duty,
but do you think this is smart?

31:09.367 --> 31:10.201
I think so.

31:11.244 --> 31:14.247
I think if I don't get back up
on the horse again fast,

31:14.330 --> 31:15.832
I may not get back on at all.

31:16.583 --> 31:18.084
-(grunts)
-Mm.

31:19.294 --> 31:22.297
Hmm. Don't you think 24 hours bed rest
might be in order?

31:23.006 --> 31:26.009
I had nightmares about
this place all last night. Some rest.

31:26.509 --> 31:29.804
Besides, I have an Italian bodyguard
with a killer right, remember?

31:29.888 --> 31:32.223
-(both chuckling)
-Uh, excuse me.

31:32.557 --> 31:35.101
Uh, the chief is out
for the rest of the afternoon, Frank.

31:35.184 --> 31:37.437
-I just left word.
-Damn. Thanks, Ray.

31:40.231 --> 31:41.316
What's happening?

31:42.442 --> 31:45.236
I just had a chat with Feeny's lawyer,

31:45.320 --> 31:47.780
who was doing an excellent impersonation
of the Cheshire Cat.

31:48.281 --> 31:51.618
I have the feeling the only person
further out in the cold

31:51.701 --> 31:54.203
in the Mizell case than I am, is Mizell.

31:56.664 --> 31:58.458
Better go see my little monster.

32:02.545 --> 32:04.047
First rate, Frank.

32:05.882 --> 32:09.218
I admire a man whose reach
exceeds his grasp.

32:10.595 --> 32:12.513
You'll have to excuse me,
Councilman Detweiler.

32:12.597 --> 32:13.681
I'm really jammed up here.

32:14.265 --> 32:17.143
Well, I understand you're having a problem
with the, uh, Mizell case.

32:17.226 --> 32:18.853
I'm not sure I follow you.

32:18.937 --> 32:22.565
Well, with your suspect,
actually, uh, James Feeny.

32:24.567 --> 32:25.860
Why don't you just get to the point?

32:26.653 --> 32:29.447
Well, what if I were to tell you
that the D.A.'s office,

32:29.530 --> 32:31.658
on direct orders
from your chief of police,

32:31.741 --> 32:34.535
is going to allow Mr. Feeny to walk.

32:35.036 --> 32:38.456
-Why would Daniels do that?
-To cover the dirt.

32:39.123 --> 32:43.920
Frank, the story on Officer Mizell
is beginning to, uh, spread.

32:44.629 --> 32:47.131
Your suspect could make it
front-page news.

32:47.465 --> 32:51.511
Everybody knows that Chief Daniels
is gonna run for mayor next November.

32:51.928 --> 32:57.141
A candidate who already has Lew Hogan
and Jefferson Heights around his neck

32:57.517 --> 32:59.852
-can't afford another scandal.
-I have Feeny cold.

33:00.478 --> 33:02.730
Yes, and, uh, Hitler took Moscow,
didn't he?

33:02.814 --> 33:06.359
Hold it. I'm tired of being
led around by the nose

33:06.442 --> 33:09.237
while you types play footsies
with one another under the table.

33:09.320 --> 33:10.780
If I'm gonna be in charge
of this investigation,

33:10.863 --> 33:12.824
I need all the cards, starting with yours.

33:12.907 --> 33:15.159
I'm telling you what I know, Furillo.

33:15.243 --> 33:16.869
Then tell me
what you're getting out of all this.

33:16.953 --> 33:19.664
Me? (chuckles) I'm not getting anything.

33:20.123 --> 33:23.751
I've just informed a police official
about an attempted cover-up,

33:23.960 --> 33:28.006
a cop who will do his darndest
to protect the integrity of the force.

33:29.132 --> 33:32.635
And put a knife in Daniels's
political balloon along the way.

33:32.719 --> 33:35.805
-Aw.
-Oh, I... I get it.

33:36.639 --> 33:37.974
You're running for mayor, too.

33:39.517 --> 33:40.893
I filed this morning.

33:41.436 --> 33:43.062
I'm the best man, Furillo.

33:43.646 --> 33:47.400
I could do the police a lot of good,
especially you.

33:47.817 --> 33:50.278
-And you can get out of here now.
-(door opens)

33:52.113 --> 33:56.200
Don't slide on this one, Captain.
You could get a butt full of splinters.

34:20.266 --> 34:22.226
-(tires screech)
-(horn honks)

34:27.815 --> 34:29.400
I didn't see you. I'm sorry.

34:30.276 --> 34:33.196
-You all right?
-(groans)

34:33.279 --> 34:36.115
Somebody call--
Somebody call an ambulance! Hurry!

34:37.492 --> 34:39.118
Can you feel that? I'm pinching your arm.

34:39.202 --> 34:40.995
-Can you feel that?
-(groans)

34:41.079 --> 34:43.206
HILL: All right, give him
some room. Stand back.

34:43.289 --> 34:45.541
-What happened?
-Uh, he came out from the--

34:45.625 --> 34:47.376
Did you hit him? Is that the idea?

34:47.460 --> 34:50.004
Go stand against the car.
If you hit him, go stand against the car.

34:50.088 --> 34:52.715
Back up, sir.
Back up on the sidewalk. Let's go.

34:52.799 --> 34:55.134
Sorry, ma'am, let's go.
Back on the sidewalk.

34:55.843 --> 34:57.220
Now, did anyone see what happened here?

34:58.346 --> 34:59.514
HILL: Did you see what happened?

35:00.098 --> 35:02.058
I saw the whole thing, Officer.

35:03.768 --> 35:05.728
(helicopter blade whirring)

35:09.607 --> 35:11.567
HOWARD: Pick up the phone, Tucker.

35:11.943 --> 35:14.529
Your wife would very much
like to speak to you.

35:15.363 --> 35:17.115
COFFEY: He's not answering, Lieutenant.

35:17.615 --> 35:19.826
You're running out of time, Tucker.

35:20.827 --> 35:21.953
The line just went dead.

35:23.329 --> 35:26.207
Sweeney feels he can get a percentage
shot off through the side window, sir.

35:27.166 --> 35:28.459
CHESLEY: Someone's coming out!

35:31.254 --> 35:32.380
Hold your fire!

35:39.220 --> 35:42.223
He's got a gun, and he wanted... (crying)

35:42.306 --> 35:44.267
Okay, okay. Take your time.

35:44.350 --> 35:46.227
Here, sit down. Sit down. Come on.

35:46.310 --> 35:49.063
Sit down. Take your time. Take your time.

35:50.064 --> 35:52.483
You're safe. You're safe.

35:53.818 --> 35:55.820
Listen to me. Listen to me.

35:57.113 --> 35:57.989
What does he want?

35:58.906 --> 36:01.659
He said he'd release all the hostages.

36:03.870 --> 36:04.829
On what terms?

36:04.912 --> 36:09.167
He wants his wife and some cop
he called "21 days."

36:09.250 --> 36:10.334
(sobs)

36:11.210 --> 36:12.420
I think he means me, Lieutenant.

36:13.129 --> 36:17.258
Negative. It's against policy
to exchange police officers for hostages.

36:17.717 --> 36:19.510
Eight for two.
That sounds like a fair deal.

36:19.594 --> 36:20.845
-Lieutenant.
-Joe...

36:21.804 --> 36:24.557
a policeman's function
is arbitration and action,

36:24.640 --> 36:28.227
not catering to the whims
of some lunatic with a weapon.

36:28.311 --> 36:31.522
He says he'll release all the hostages
if we give him his wife and Joe.

36:31.606 --> 36:32.899
FURILLO (on radio):
<i>Sounds risky. What do you think?</i>

36:32.982 --> 36:34.108
I say it's a good risk.

36:34.192 --> 36:35.109
<i>Only if they agree.</i>

36:35.193 --> 36:37.945
He seems more anxious
to make a point than to hurt anyone.

36:38.029 --> 36:39.906
<i>-Okay, go.</i>
-Right.

36:40.698 --> 36:41.866
Lieutenant.

36:42.491 --> 36:44.869
The captain says it's up
to Joe and Mrs. Tucker,

36:45.203 --> 36:47.663
but under no circumstances
does he get anyone else.

36:59.800 --> 37:02.929
Joseph, in two more minutes
I could secrete a weapon...

37:03.387 --> 37:04.222
It's all right, Lieutenant.

37:04.305 --> 37:07.308
This is not a situation
that you play according to Hoyle.

37:07.516 --> 37:10.102
Time is on your side, Wilna.
Time and love.

37:10.186 --> 37:11.312
I hope you're right.

37:11.395 --> 37:13.397
I promise you,
the longer you're in there with him,

37:13.481 --> 37:15.024
the better our chances are.

37:16.943 --> 37:19.820
Okay. How you doing?

37:20.279 --> 37:21.197
Pretty well.

37:23.658 --> 37:25.576
This whole thing's gonna
turn out all right.

37:26.994 --> 37:28.246
Can I get an amen?

37:29.330 --> 37:30.248
Amen.

37:44.512 --> 37:46.347
FRANK: How long have they been
out of view, Alf?

37:48.266 --> 37:49.642
Do you feel they're at risk?

37:50.893 --> 37:53.688
Uh, then have Howard's men
track for position.

37:53.771 --> 37:55.523
I don't want to-- Right.

37:55.940 --> 37:57.233
(tapping)

37:59.735 --> 38:01.195
I'm gonna be talking to the D.A.'s people

38:01.279 --> 38:02.947
for a couple of minutes,
so you coordinate with Leo.

38:03.030 --> 38:05.366
But this is authorization.
Do what you have to out there.

38:06.117 --> 38:07.243
(telephone thuds)

38:07.326 --> 38:08.494
What can I do you for, Captain?

38:08.995 --> 38:11.789
-I'd like to see your degree, Dr. Renko.
-Captain?

38:11.872 --> 38:14.625
-Your medical degree.
-I'm sorry, sir. I don't understand.

38:14.709 --> 38:17.169
Didn't you make a diagnosis
earlier today at County?

38:17.253 --> 38:20.548
Didn't you try to talk an intern
into writing up a shooting victim DOA?

38:20.631 --> 38:21.924
(sighs) Well, sir, yes, I--

38:22.008 --> 38:24.010
I raised the possibility
with the gentleman, sir,

38:24.093 --> 38:26.012
with an off-the-cuff suggestion.

38:26.095 --> 38:29.557
An attempt to coerce a physician
into criminally fraudulent filing

38:29.640 --> 38:31.892
is hardly an off-the-cuff
suggestion, mister.

38:32.268 --> 38:34.520
-You're lucky you still have a badge.
-The guy was dying in the car.

38:34.603 --> 38:36.439
So a little street justice
was in order, right?

38:36.522 --> 38:39.150
You opened this department
and precinct to all kinds of trouble.

38:39.233 --> 38:41.235
You risked your partner's reputation,
for one thing--

38:41.319 --> 38:43.779
Sir, I'm not gonna stand there
while some killer gets off!

38:43.863 --> 38:45.865
You're a lazy cop, Renko,
and that's a lying cop!

38:45.948 --> 38:48.117
You get your head up
or get out of this business.

38:50.911 --> 38:52.747
-Is that it?
-Yes.

38:54.915 --> 38:55.958
(door slams)

39:02.923 --> 39:05.134
(camera shutter clicks)

39:07.261 --> 39:09.430
I don't understand
why I gotta wear this thing.

39:09.722 --> 39:11.640
Your arm is hurt very terribly.

39:12.099 --> 39:16.062
Please to fill this at Fontain Pharmacy.
This is two blocks that way.

39:16.145 --> 39:18.481
-What's this for?
-The pain.

39:18.564 --> 39:21.984
-I don't feel any pain.
-The pain will begin later.

39:22.276 --> 39:25.237
-I don't have any money.
-They will extend credit.

39:25.863 --> 39:27.907
We need the record of medication.

39:28.574 --> 39:31.702
-What about X-rays?
-Not to be concerned.

39:31.786 --> 39:33.412
What do you mean, "not to be concerned"?

39:33.496 --> 39:35.039
Don't I need some X-rays?

39:35.122 --> 39:36.248
(chuckles)

39:36.332 --> 39:38.876
You are an inquisitive little bum,
aren't you?

39:39.960 --> 39:42.797
We took a special kind of X-ray
while you were sitting there.

39:44.131 --> 39:47.843
Now go to this pharmacy.
Then come to see me next week.

39:47.927 --> 39:51.013
-That's it?
-That's it. Very much.

39:55.976 --> 39:57.603
-Doctor.
-Thank you.

39:57.686 --> 39:58.771
Right this way.

40:00.272 --> 40:01.774
(chattering)

40:06.570 --> 40:09.532
Gloria Currin you know,
representing Jim Feeny.

40:10.199 --> 40:13.035
This is Leon Freed,
Drug Enforcement Administration,

40:13.119 --> 40:14.495
and, of course, Captain Fuchs.

40:14.578 --> 40:17.331
This where the captain finds out
what everybody else already knows?

40:18.040 --> 40:22.920
Very simply, Ms. Currin's client's
in a position to do the DEA a lot of good.

40:23.379 --> 40:26.215
He can make cases for us
in six different cities, Captain.

40:26.715 --> 40:29.802
-The guy does escrow on coke deals.
-Allegedly.

40:30.052 --> 40:32.263
-He also killed a cop.
-Allegedly.

40:32.346 --> 40:34.306
And while I wouldn't think
this is the best place

40:34.390 --> 40:36.392
to discuss the merits of our case...

40:36.475 --> 40:38.644
You'd be lucky
if you make it manslaughter.

40:38.727 --> 40:41.397
I will say that in declining to prosecute,

40:41.480 --> 40:45.734
we've considered that a policeman's life
and reputation are involved.

40:45.818 --> 40:46.819
Meaning...

40:48.696 --> 40:51.407
I put your cop on trial alongside Feeny,

40:52.158 --> 40:54.827
the stories I hear,
Feeny comes out second.

40:57.163 --> 40:58.080
He was your cop.

40:59.415 --> 41:00.624
It's federal, Frank.

41:01.125 --> 41:02.126
What terms?

41:03.461 --> 41:06.046
We waive prosecution in the death
and all adjunctive matters.

41:06.130 --> 41:08.174
DEA gets him for three years.

41:08.257 --> 41:10.801
-After which?
-Witness relocation.

41:10.885 --> 41:14.430
But we send him right back for trial,
Captain, the minute he doesn't cooperate.

41:15.097 --> 41:17.600
I mean, if you could think of it
in terms of priorities.

41:17.683 --> 41:20.352
Don't read me a lesson in civics,
Mr. Freed.

41:22.438 --> 41:24.148
We had an appointment, Captain Fuchs.

41:24.231 --> 41:27.109
Just for the wrap-up, Frank,
could I get all your paperwork on Mizell?

41:27.193 --> 41:28.152
Captain Fuchs.

41:28.235 --> 41:30.112
When can I get the paperwork, Captain?

41:30.196 --> 41:31.864
Call me tomorrow morning.

41:37.495 --> 41:40.539
The DEA's been romancing
Feeny for three months.

41:40.623 --> 41:42.041
I understand that.

41:43.000 --> 41:46.337
I also understand that someone
with the worries you had this morning

41:46.420 --> 41:48.797
would be delighted to see
this investigation closed.

41:48.881 --> 41:50.549
That's not gonna happen, Jerry.

41:51.425 --> 41:53.219
What is it with you, Furillo?

41:54.553 --> 41:56.805
You want to crucify me? Huh?

41:57.223 --> 41:59.725
You wanna make your career
by burying mine?

42:00.017 --> 42:03.938
If you didn't keep a tight enough rein
on Mizell, if he was freelancing,

42:04.021 --> 42:06.899
that's just bad
administrative judgment, Jer.

42:07.233 --> 42:11.070
But believe me, if you're thinking
about some kind of cover-up...

42:11.820 --> 42:13.864
All I'm doing is obeying orders

42:13.948 --> 42:16.033
-and letting the damn thing drop.
-(thuds)

42:16.116 --> 42:19.662
You're the only one
who's pushing the issue.

42:19.745 --> 42:21.914
Let me explain something to you, friend.

42:21.997 --> 42:25.793
All that happened in that room today
was that the D.A. declined prosecution.

42:25.876 --> 42:28.128
That means we don't do
Mizell's laundry in public.

42:28.212 --> 42:30.464
But he was a cop, and he was killed.

42:31.715 --> 42:34.718
For internal circulation,
never mind the possibility

42:34.802 --> 42:37.346
that Feeny loses his voice
as a federal witness,

42:37.429 --> 42:39.890
Daniels is gonna have a report.

42:39.974 --> 42:41.850
That means he's gonna
give you the opportunity

42:41.934 --> 42:45.688
to make just the mistake you've been
thinking about by holding back your files.

42:46.814 --> 42:49.608
I don't understand this, Frank.
What the hell's going on here?

42:49.692 --> 42:52.236
Come on, Jerry.
For God's sake, open your eyes.

42:52.319 --> 42:54.029
It's called a power play.

42:54.863 --> 42:57.366
Between Detweiler and Daniels
and the mayor's race,

42:57.449 --> 42:59.910
you might just end up
with your head on a platter.

43:01.579 --> 43:02.454
Oh, yeah?

43:02.913 --> 43:06.041
Well, maybe I'll just have to play
some politics of my own.

43:06.417 --> 43:09.336
Guys like Daniels and Detweiler
make their careers

43:09.420 --> 43:11.964
on the backs of middle-level grunts
like you and me.

43:12.047 --> 43:14.341
I'm telling you this as a friend, Jerry.

43:14.758 --> 43:18.512
Your only alternative
is to play it straight, by the numbers.

43:19.305 --> 43:22.766
You gotta believe me, Frank.
I don't deserve a hanging party.

43:23.142 --> 43:25.853
Look, if the files are embarrassing,
take the embarrassment.

43:25.936 --> 43:29.148
I can't believe they're any more than
that. You're just too good a cop.

43:29.231 --> 43:31.233
But if you hold back or sanitize them,

43:31.317 --> 43:33.611
Daniels can scapegoat you
anytime he wants.

43:33.694 --> 43:36.280
You'll spend the rest of your career
in his hip pocket.

43:42.286 --> 43:44.330
You'll have 'em on your desk
tomorrow morning.

44:02.014 --> 44:04.308
VERNON: What's the trouble, 21 days?

44:07.728 --> 44:08.854
My back hurts.

44:10.689 --> 44:13.067
Lord gives us crosses, huh?

44:13.150 --> 44:15.319
(chuckles)

44:22.326 --> 44:24.453
Vern, what do you say
we just get out of here

44:24.536 --> 44:26.163
and go get a pizza or something?

44:31.835 --> 44:34.171
-(crying)
-Hey, it's all right.

44:34.963 --> 44:35.964
Listen to her.

44:38.509 --> 44:40.010
She's got a talent for it.

44:41.637 --> 44:42.680
(crying continues)

44:42.763 --> 44:44.682
She's got a callin', you know?

44:45.224 --> 44:47.976
Just keep it up. Keep it up.

44:49.520 --> 44:52.022
-I'm sorry.
-Then keep it up!

44:53.399 --> 44:55.609
-Hey, why don't you lighten up, Vernon?
-Lighten up?

44:55.693 --> 44:56.902
Lighten up?

44:58.278 --> 44:59.196
Okay.

45:00.114 --> 45:01.323
VERNON: Okay, man.

45:03.242 --> 45:04.076
Okay.

45:06.370 --> 45:08.831
Here's the plan, 21 days.

45:11.166 --> 45:12.501
Here's the point.

45:13.502 --> 45:16.171
-Now, I'm gonna count down from five.
-(gun cocks)

45:17.131 --> 45:19.508
When I'm finished,
I'm taking you out, man.

45:21.343 --> 45:22.928
I'm gonna blow you away.

45:30.352 --> 45:31.228
(gun thuds)

45:31.729 --> 45:34.481
That... That's my plan.

45:34.732 --> 45:36.483
If you got a plan B,

45:37.901 --> 45:38.986
that's your problem.

45:40.904 --> 45:41.780
Okay?

45:45.951 --> 45:46.910
Vernon.

45:47.494 --> 45:49.288
So, now pick up the piece, turkey.

45:50.122 --> 45:52.207
Or if you ain't got a hair to do it...

45:52.916 --> 45:53.959
Now pick it up.

45:55.753 --> 45:57.129
Forget it, Vernon.
I'm not gonna shoot you.

45:57.212 --> 45:58.839
Forget it? Forget it?

45:59.965 --> 46:01.842
You forget it, 21 days!

46:01.925 --> 46:04.887
Hell, this is gonna take you all
until tomorrow afternoon

46:04.970 --> 46:06.764
to put this one behind you.

46:08.223 --> 46:11.393
It's gonna take a lot
of positive thinkin', man!

46:11.894 --> 46:13.437
Now pick it up!

46:14.730 --> 46:17.065
-I'm not doin' it, Vernon.
-Come on, man.

46:18.984 --> 46:20.444
Okay. Okay.

46:21.862 --> 46:25.574
Hey, maybe you don't mind
gamblin' with your own life.

46:28.243 --> 46:32.414
What about gamblin' with hers? Huh? Yeah.

46:32.498 --> 46:34.666
-Come on now. Stop it, Vernon!
-Yeah, yeah!

46:34.750 --> 46:37.669
VERNON: Come on, 21 days.
I'm counting, man!

46:37.753 --> 46:40.005
-Vernon, I said stop it!
-Five, four, three!

46:40.088 --> 46:42.424
Come on, man! Do it! Do it! Do it!

46:42.508 --> 46:43.717
Vernon! Vernon!

46:44.384 --> 46:46.011
(gunshot)

47:11.578 --> 47:15.123
When I went away and I got my uniform,

47:18.001 --> 47:21.338
on the way over,
I remember I was thinkin' about how

47:21.755 --> 47:23.215
when I was an old guy,

47:25.634 --> 47:29.012
I'd take my grandson up in the attic
and I'd show him the uniform.

47:38.438 --> 47:39.982
But after I got back,

47:41.149 --> 47:42.734
after those three weeks...

47:48.490 --> 47:49.533
when nobody wanted--

47:53.954 --> 47:56.123
I went out in the woods and I burned it.

47:58.250 --> 47:59.793
I burned my uniform.

48:17.644 --> 48:18.729
Long day, huh, Luce?

48:33.285 --> 48:36.288
(closing theme playing)
