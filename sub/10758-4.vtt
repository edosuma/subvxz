WEBVTT

00:10.375 --> 00:13.086
Well, I'd better be heading out.
Niles and I are meeting for dinner.

00:13.295 --> 00:14.713
And then we have tickets

00:14.880 --> 00:17.007
- to the theatrical event of the season.
- Really?

00:17.216 --> 00:19.635
<i>Yes. Sir Trevor Ainsley
in Tears of the Mariner.</i>

00:20.219 --> 00:21.970
It promises
to be a very exciting evening.

00:22.137 --> 00:26.725
You see, Seattle is Sir Trevor's
last stop on his farewell tour.

00:26.892 --> 00:29.353
After this,
he's retiring from the stage forever.

00:29.561 --> 00:31.897
<i>Tears of the Mariner.
I think I read a review of that.</i>

00:32.064 --> 00:35.067
<i>I thought it was one of those baseball
stories like Pride of the Yankees.</i>

00:35.317 --> 00:38.653
But it's just about some crabby
old sailor stuck in this little town...

00:38.820 --> 00:41.948
No, no, Dad, please. I have carefully
avoided all the reviews of this play.

00:42.157 --> 00:44.326
I don't wanna hear about it
before I see it.

00:44.576 --> 00:47.370
Well, I don't wanna hear about it
after you see it.

00:49.080 --> 00:50.582
- Oh, hello, Daphne.
- Hey, Daph.

00:50.749 --> 00:53.752
That's it? "Hello, Daphne"?
Haven't you seen the paper?

00:53.919 --> 00:56.171
No, I glanced at it. Why?
Did I miss something?

00:56.338 --> 00:57.380
Look.

00:57.589 --> 01:00.383
- Oh, my gosh. Is that you?
- Yes.

01:00.592 --> 01:03.428
Good heavens.
Well, it's kind of hard to tell.

01:03.595 --> 01:05.263
You've got your back
turned to the camera

01:05.430 --> 01:06.973
and your skirt's blown up
around your...

01:07.182 --> 01:10.310
Oh, well, it must have been
rather blustery out.

01:10.518 --> 01:12.437
I was in the park yesterday.
This photographer

01:12.604 --> 01:14.773
snapped my picture
for the "It's Your Seattle" column.

01:15.023 --> 01:17.525
The one where they show
some average person out and about,

01:17.692 --> 01:19.277
then use their name on the column.

01:19.527 --> 01:21.112
If they took a picture of Mr. Crane,

01:21.279 --> 01:23.740
the caption would read,
"Martin Crane's Seattle."

01:23.948 --> 01:26.284
If they took one of you,
it would say, "Frasier Crane's..."

01:26.451 --> 01:27.744
Yes, we get it.

01:28.620 --> 01:31.247
Don't crinkle it.
I want to send it home to my family.

01:31.456 --> 01:34.083
- You sure about that?
- Oh, don't be such an old fogy.

01:34.292 --> 01:36.461
So I'm bending down
and me knickers are showing a bit,

01:36.628 --> 01:39.881
but my family will still be as proud
as peacocks when they see that.

01:40.048 --> 01:42.467
"Daphne Moon's Seattle."

01:44.969 --> 01:46.846
She certainly does.

01:51.309 --> 01:53.978
Niles, will you just stop it?
The dinner was just fine.

01:54.145 --> 01:57.648
It was not fine. I made
those reservations weeks ago.

01:57.899 --> 01:59.358
They seated us
so close to the kitchen

01:59.567 --> 02:01.903
I'm surprised
they didn't make us wear hairnets.

02:02.069 --> 02:04.489
- I'm sure it was just a mix-up.
- Not a mix-up.

02:04.739 --> 02:06.407
It's part of an alarming trend
I've noticed

02:06.574 --> 02:09.118
- since Maris and I parted company.
- Oh, Niles.

02:09.327 --> 02:12.288
Last week, Roberta Phipps
snubbed me at the opera.

02:12.496 --> 02:14.290
I wasn't even invited
to that gala fundraiser

02:14.498 --> 02:15.791
for Saint Andrew's Orphanage.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.336
You can still send money
to the children.

02:18.753 --> 02:20.504
As usual, you've missed the point.

02:22.256 --> 02:23.507
I'm being shut out.

02:23.674 --> 02:27.386
It is as if someone snuck into my world
and changed all the locks.

02:28.012 --> 02:29.472
Oh, Niles.

02:29.680 --> 02:34.351
Well, at least you don't have to worry
about that tonight.

02:34.769 --> 02:37.188
- After you.
- Thank you. Evening.

02:37.354 --> 02:39.190
Tickets, please.

02:39.356 --> 02:42.193
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
These aren't for this performance.

02:42.443 --> 02:43.444
- What?
- What?

02:43.611 --> 02:46.280
But they say for the 16th.
There's the 16th right there.

02:46.447 --> 02:49.241
- That's today.
- Yes, sir. They were for the matinee.

02:49.450 --> 02:51.827
No, no, this had to be some mistake.
Let me just...

02:52.036 --> 02:55.164
- Oh, dear God.
- I'm so sorry, Niles.

02:55.372 --> 02:58.584
Well, surely you must hold
some tickets aside for emergencies.

02:58.792 --> 03:01.837
- We'll take anything, anything at all.
- Yes, yes, even mezzanine.

03:02.046 --> 03:04.548
If you like, you can try your luck
in the cancellation line.

03:08.719 --> 03:10.262
How could this happen?

03:11.555 --> 03:12.806
I have to see this play.

03:12.973 --> 03:14.683
I have to have people
see me see this play.

03:14.892 --> 03:17.561
- If I'm not seen seeing this play, see...
- Niles, Niles.

03:18.228 --> 03:19.605
I will make a simple phone call,

03:19.813 --> 03:21.899
and we'll get house seats
for tomorrow night.

03:22.149 --> 03:24.193
- All right?
- I suppose so.

03:24.401 --> 03:25.819
Come on, let's go.

03:25.986 --> 03:27.863
The last thing I need
is to have someone see us

03:28.071 --> 03:29.531
loitering here like gutter riffraff,

03:29.740 --> 03:33.160
pathetically scrounging
for last-minute tickets.

03:37.998 --> 03:39.041
Good luck.

03:46.923 --> 03:47.966
- Oh, Niles.
- Hello.

03:48.175 --> 03:50.469
I know I'm early.
I was hoping we might get a bite to eat.

03:50.677 --> 03:51.678
Actually, Niles...

03:51.928 --> 03:54.639
It'll be on me as a thank-you
for getting those replacement tickets.

03:54.848 --> 03:56.725
- About the tickets...
- I know I owe you money.

03:56.933 --> 03:58.685
And my gratitude,
and if I keep talking,

03:58.852 --> 04:01.521
you won't be able to tell me
you weren't able to get the tickets.

04:01.771 --> 04:04.566
- I haven't been able to get them yet.
- I knew you wouldn't get them.

04:04.774 --> 04:06.610
- Niles, please.
- It's too late. It's 6:00.

04:06.776 --> 04:09.195
Please just calm down.
I've made a few well-placed calls.

04:09.362 --> 04:11.990
I haven't heard back from
a couple of people. Someone will call.

04:12.198 --> 04:14.034
Well, someone better call,

04:14.284 --> 04:16.244
because everyone who's anyone
is seeing this play.

04:16.452 --> 04:20.290
You know who you are
if you're not anyone? You're no one.

04:20.540 --> 04:24.544
And I've been someone much too long
to start being no one now.

04:24.711 --> 04:27.547
Oh, hey, I thought no one was here.

04:28.381 --> 04:30.049
Niles, please, just relax.

04:30.300 --> 04:32.343
One way or another,
we are going to get tickets.

04:32.552 --> 04:35.305
You two still going on
about those tickets?

04:35.555 --> 04:37.348
If this play's any good,
in a couple of years,

04:37.557 --> 04:42.145
they'll do it at the dinner theatre and
you can get a nice prime rib with it.

04:48.901 --> 04:52.822
Dad, you don't understand.
You see, this isn't just about the play.

04:52.989 --> 04:55.074
This is literally our last opportunity

04:55.241 --> 04:58.661
to see one of the finest actors
of our time.

04:58.911 --> 05:00.872
You wanna go because
your snobby friends are going

05:01.080 --> 05:02.415
and you don't wanna feel left out.

05:02.665 --> 05:07.462
What we want is to sit in a theatre
and share a transcendent experience.

05:07.670 --> 05:11.674
- That nobody else could get tickets to.
- That's the transcendent part.

05:14.427 --> 05:16.137
It's them.

05:16.846 --> 05:18.222
Hello?

05:18.431 --> 05:19.807
Yes, I'll hold. It's Clea Fenwick.

05:20.016 --> 05:21.684
- Clea Fenwick?
- Yes, you remember her.

05:21.934 --> 05:24.478
She's on the board of the theatre.
You've seen her. Bad eye job.

05:24.687 --> 05:26.647
Dowager's hump
you could cross the Sahara on.

05:28.107 --> 05:30.443
Hello, Clea, you lovely thing.

05:32.695 --> 05:35.656
Oh, well, you're a dear
for trying. Thanks.

05:35.865 --> 05:39.160
Don't despair, Niles.
I'm getting another call. Hello?

05:39.368 --> 05:41.454
Yes, Dora. Yes.

05:42.621 --> 05:45.541
Too bad. Well, thank you.
Yeah...

05:45.708 --> 05:48.169
Oh, that is a wonderful idea.
Yes, I will.

05:48.377 --> 05:50.963
- Thank you. Bye-bye.
- She has a lead for us?

05:51.172 --> 05:53.007
Yes. She said I should call
Clea Fenwick.

05:56.719 --> 05:58.220
This is hopeless.

05:58.429 --> 06:01.974
Niles, there is another way.

06:03.142 --> 06:05.019
- You don't mean?
- Yes.

06:05.644 --> 06:07.813
I know it's a calculated risk.
It's a little uncertain.

06:07.980 --> 06:11.233
- You can't be serious. It's unthinkable.
- Niles, what other choice do we have?

06:11.442 --> 06:14.236
But the indignity.
It reeks of desperation.

06:14.486 --> 06:16.280
Now, now,
before you do anything desperate,

06:16.488 --> 06:19.450
at least go and stand
in the cancellation line.

06:20.284 --> 06:22.744
What did he think
we were talking about?

06:27.916 --> 06:30.586
You know, this isn't half
as humiliating as I thought it would be.

06:30.752 --> 06:33.380
Oh, you're right.
I don't know why we were so afraid.

06:35.257 --> 06:37.384
Oh, no.
There's Steven and Susan Kendall.

06:38.760 --> 06:42.264
Quick, turn around.
If they see us here, we'll be ruined.

06:42.431 --> 06:43.932
- They know everybody.
- Yes, I know.

06:44.099 --> 06:47.644
Their Sunday brunches
are a who's who of Seattle's elite.

06:49.354 --> 06:51.648
I think it's safe. No one saw us.

06:51.857 --> 06:54.276
- Hey, Frasier, Niles.
- Hi, Roz.

06:54.443 --> 06:57.487
- What are you doing here?
- And how did you get tickets?

06:57.696 --> 06:59.823
A friend couldn't use hers
so she gave them to me.

06:59.990 --> 07:04.161
I asked my cute new dentist.
He's a big fan of Sir What's-his-face.

07:04.369 --> 07:06.413
You refer to the world's greatest
living actor as...

07:06.621 --> 07:08.748
Now, Frasier, Roz may not
be familiar with Sir Trevor,

07:08.957 --> 07:10.458
but I'm sure she'll enjoy the play.

07:10.709 --> 07:13.003
- I trust you got good seats.
- I think so.

07:13.878 --> 07:17.007
- Row C.
- Row C. Excellent.

07:17.215 --> 07:19.592
Look, a whole bunch of naked men.

07:20.969 --> 07:22.095
What are you doing?

07:22.303 --> 07:24.014
Give me those.
You don't even know his name.

07:24.222 --> 07:26.224
Are you crazy?

07:28.476 --> 07:30.186
- Ready to go, Roz?
- Yes.

07:30.395 --> 07:32.564
- Dr. Mandel?
- Oh, hi, Niles.

07:32.772 --> 07:33.815
You two know each other?

07:33.982 --> 07:36.985
Sure.
How's the teeth bleaching going?

07:38.069 --> 07:39.362
Fine, thanks.

07:42.907 --> 07:43.950
Let's go, Rob.

07:44.158 --> 07:47.829
It's a long way to Row C
from the cancellation line.

07:48.329 --> 07:51.666
Hang in there, guys.
I wouldn't be surprised if you get lucky.

07:51.916 --> 07:53.960
I'd be stupefied if you didn't.

07:58.423 --> 08:01.509
I knew you were bleaching them.

08:01.676 --> 08:04.387
"No, really,
I just changed toothpastes."

08:04.595 --> 08:08.182
Is that Niles Crane? And Frasier?

08:08.433 --> 08:12.353
- Susan, Steven, good to see you.
- We're seeing everybody tonight.

08:12.520 --> 08:13.688
It's simply...

08:13.938 --> 08:16.983
Oh, dear. You're not waiting
for a cancellation, are you?

08:17.191 --> 08:21.404
A what? Oh, is that what this is?

08:25.616 --> 08:27.159
Oh, look at us.

08:27.368 --> 08:29.787
Blocking these poor unfortunates
who couldn't get tickets.

08:30.037 --> 08:31.706
I got one pair left. Who's next?

08:32.206 --> 08:35.001
- Curtain going up.
- Curtain going up. Shall we?

08:35.543 --> 08:38.294
- Next in line, please.
- Niles, are you coming?

08:40.047 --> 08:43.217
You'll have to forgive Niles.

08:43.384 --> 08:44.885
He's too ashamed to admit

08:45.136 --> 08:47.888
that he's just waiting
for one last cigarette.

08:48.139 --> 08:49.348
It's all right. You go ahead.

08:49.557 --> 08:52.560
- I'll just see the Kendalls in.
- Thank God, another smoker.

08:52.810 --> 08:55.354
Darling, maybe I'll just stay
and have a cigarette with Niles.

08:55.563 --> 08:57.731
Do you want these tickets, sir?

08:57.898 --> 08:58.941
Me?

09:02.069 --> 09:05.739
No, no, no.

09:05.906 --> 09:08.409
Steven, please,
I'd really like to sit down.

09:08.575 --> 09:10.369
All right. Niles, we'll make a date.

09:10.577 --> 09:12.955
I'll meet you here at intermission
and we'll have a smoke.

09:13.580 --> 09:16.166
Right here is where I'll be.

09:17.334 --> 09:19.962
- Enjoy.
- See you later.

09:22.506 --> 09:24.716
Well, this is just perfect.

09:24.925 --> 09:27.302
Not only are we missing the play,
but we have to hang around

09:27.469 --> 09:29.388
until intermission
so they won't catch on to us.

09:29.596 --> 09:30.848
What are you complaining about?

09:31.014 --> 09:33.934
I'm the one who has an hour
to learn how to smoke.

09:35.000 --> 09:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:43.360 --> 09:44.778
Niles, they're coming out.

09:45.028 --> 09:46.363
Come on, let's blend in.

09:50.409 --> 09:52.619
- Niles, what are you doing?
- I'm practising.

09:52.786 --> 09:54.955
I haven't held a cigarette
since I played Duke Mantee

09:55.122 --> 09:57.290
<i>in our junior high production
of The Petrified Forest.</i>

09:57.457 --> 10:00.669
Yes, I remember watching you
from the petrified audience. Come on.

10:01.294 --> 10:03.755
Oh, there they are. Let's go.

10:03.964 --> 10:06.341
- Oh, well, you got out here quickly.
- Yeah.

10:06.591 --> 10:08.468
I guess you needed one of these
more than I did.

10:08.677 --> 10:12.180
Yes, well, when you enjoy smoking
as much as I do.

10:16.518 --> 10:20.397
Bye-bye, feel better. I'll call you.

10:20.647 --> 10:22.399
The Gormleys.
Kendra isn't feeling well.

10:22.565 --> 10:24.818
- Richard is taking her home.
- Oh, well.

10:25.068 --> 10:27.654
- There's Miggy and Lyle.
- Poor old dears.

10:27.821 --> 10:29.280
They could only get balcony.

10:29.531 --> 10:33.410
Still, we should say hello.
They are your parents. Excuse us.

10:33.660 --> 10:35.036
Yes.

10:39.249 --> 10:41.334
Thank God.
Those things are turning me green.

10:41.501 --> 10:44.295
Never mind that, Niles.
The Gormleys aren't coming back.

10:44.504 --> 10:46.631
Let's sneak into their seats
and watch the second act.

10:46.840 --> 10:48.341
Come on, let's go.

10:48.508 --> 10:51.177
- Your ticket stubs, please.
- Oh, I beg your pardon?

10:51.427 --> 10:54.597
I'm sorry, we've had some people
try to sneak in after intermission.

10:54.847 --> 10:59.727
Well, you know,
I think we left our coats in our seats,

10:59.936 --> 11:01.813
and the stubs are in the coats.

11:02.021 --> 11:03.856
- Oh, well, don't worry about it.
- Thank you.

11:04.023 --> 11:05.566
We'll have someone
bring your coats.

11:05.775 --> 11:06.943
Where are your seats?

11:09.195 --> 11:12.698
I'll have to check the seating chart.

11:14.617 --> 11:16.577
- Aren't you going in?
- Oh, yes, yes.

11:16.786 --> 11:19.455
My brother just needed to have
one last cigarette.

11:19.622 --> 11:21.791
- Oh, you're worse than Steven.
- Yes, yes.

11:21.958 --> 11:24.710
Really, Niles, I do wish you'd quit.
I'm begging you.

11:25.211 --> 11:29.048
I just wish I didn't love
the damn things so much.

11:29.298 --> 11:32.677
Yes, well, if we don't see you
afterward, have a lovely evening.

11:32.885 --> 11:35.137
Actually,
we're having a small supper

11:35.388 --> 11:37.348
at La Chanteuse afterwards
for Sir Trevor.

11:37.556 --> 11:40.643
So if you're not busy,
say, around 11?

11:44.480 --> 11:47.191
Good. We'll see you then.

11:49.568 --> 11:51.362
Frasier.

11:52.947 --> 11:55.366
Dinner with Sir Trevor.
That's better than seeing the play.

11:55.574 --> 11:57.576
Niles, are you insane?

11:57.743 --> 11:59.995
We know absolutely nothing
about the damn play.

12:00.204 --> 12:02.873
How can we possibly talk
with this man?

12:03.082 --> 12:05.876
For God's sake, I just wish I'd read
that review in yesterday's paper.

12:06.085 --> 12:08.796
- Do you still have it?
- I might.

12:09.046 --> 12:10.881
Dad lets the papers
pile up for days sometimes.

12:11.090 --> 12:13.884
You know what? We've got just
enough time to get there and back.

12:14.093 --> 12:15.678
- Let's go.
- Where are you going?

12:15.886 --> 12:19.348
You see?
I told you it was the other way.

12:20.265 --> 12:21.767
Now.

12:23.936 --> 12:26.480
- What's going on?
- We're looking for yesterday's paper.

12:26.688 --> 12:28.732
- Well, it should be there.
- Oh, wait, Dad.

12:28.941 --> 12:31.318
<i>That review you're reading yesterday,
Tears of the Mariner.</i>

12:31.527 --> 12:32.736
- Do you remember it?
- Kind of.

12:32.945 --> 12:35.322
All right, just concentrate.
What was the play about?

12:35.531 --> 12:37.449
Well, let me see.

12:37.616 --> 12:40.994
It started out with this old guy
who was gutting a fish.

12:41.203 --> 12:42.246
All right, okay, good.

12:42.454 --> 12:45.999
And then he gives this fish to his son,
but his son rejects it.

12:46.208 --> 12:47.376
Good, good. Then what?

12:49.127 --> 12:52.339
Oh, yeah. Well, then it turns out
that he has this fatal disease.

12:52.547 --> 12:55.425
And the next thing you know,
he's in this big stadium,

12:55.634 --> 12:58.428
and he's telling everybody
that even though he's dying,

12:58.637 --> 13:01.848
that today, he considers himself
the luckiest man...

13:02.057 --> 13:03.725
<i>Dad, that is Pride of the Yankees.</i>

13:04.309 --> 13:07.062
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's right. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry about that.

13:07.229 --> 13:09.856
But I'm pretty sure
that fish part was right.

13:10.065 --> 13:13.318
- This is ridiculous.
- Fish part.

13:13.568 --> 13:14.653
- Wait, wait. Yes.
- Yes.

13:14.903 --> 13:15.946
Here it is. There it is.

13:16.154 --> 13:19.282
<i>"Sir Trevor Ainsley's bravura
performance in Tears of the Mariner</i>

13:19.491 --> 13:21.785
qualifies him as an..."

13:23.828 --> 13:26.665
"Continued on page A-16." A-16.

13:26.915 --> 13:28.416
Just give me a second here.

13:32.170 --> 13:33.922
- Where is it?
- Daphne.

13:34.089 --> 13:35.799
Her picture must've been
on the other side.

13:36.132 --> 13:38.426
It may still be here.
She was gonna mail it to her mother.

13:38.593 --> 13:40.887
Daphne's picture was in the paper?

13:41.096 --> 13:44.182
Yes, well, someone snapped
a candid photo of her in the park.

13:44.432 --> 13:47.310
It's not her most flattering angle,
but I'm sure you would disagree.

13:47.519 --> 13:48.770
Well, open it.

13:49.020 --> 13:50.939
Carefully.

13:51.105 --> 13:53.608
Oh, what the hell.
I'll buy her flowers.

13:54.776 --> 13:57.445
Hey, Dr. Crane,
I thought you went...?

13:58.363 --> 14:01.532
- Is that my letter?
- Daphne, let me explain.

14:01.741 --> 14:03.910
I should've known
I'd never get privacy in this house.

14:04.118 --> 14:05.495
You don't understand. I wanted to...

14:05.703 --> 14:08.831
You just wanted to find out if
I was gossiping about you to my mum.

14:08.998 --> 14:11.209
Well, fine, I was.

14:11.459 --> 14:14.212
A 73-year-old woman
in Manchester is about to find out

14:14.379 --> 14:16.297
that you dye the grey
out of your temples.

14:16.464 --> 14:17.632
There, you happy?

14:17.882 --> 14:21.010
No, I'm not happy. I am mortified.

14:22.220 --> 14:24.472
How did you know that?

14:26.265 --> 14:29.810
I keep my hair dye
in the false bottom of my cufflink box.

14:30.311 --> 14:34.774
Yeah, well, I'll let it go this time.

14:36.901 --> 14:39.695
We haven't got time for this.
We've gotta get down to that party.

14:39.904 --> 14:42.573
- I knew you were dying your hair.
- Shut up.

14:42.740 --> 14:44.617
"No, no, really,
it's just my new conditioner."

14:44.825 --> 14:46.285
Shut up.

14:49.163 --> 14:51.957
And whatever you do,
don't get specific about the play.

14:52.166 --> 14:53.626
That's the mistake
you made last year

14:53.834 --> 14:55.503
<i>when you lied about seeing
The Silent Echo.</i>

14:55.753 --> 14:58.589
All that yammering on about
how the play had third-act problems.

14:58.756 --> 15:00.674
- It fooled no one.
- What makes you so sure?

15:00.841 --> 15:04.512
<i>Well, for starters, The Silent Echo
doesn't have a third act.</i>

15:10.267 --> 15:12.269
Bravo!

15:14.521 --> 15:16.023
Thank you.

15:16.231 --> 15:18.776
God, I need a drink.

15:18.943 --> 15:21.945
- Double Scotch, no ice.
- Yes, sir.

15:22.529 --> 15:24.907
Frasier, Niles. How nice.

15:25.115 --> 15:26.742
Sir Trevor, this is Dr. Frasier Crane.

15:26.950 --> 15:29.078
- And his brother, Dr. Niles Crane.
- It's an honour.

15:29.286 --> 15:31.580
- How do you do?
- Two of our pre-eminent psychiatrists.

15:31.789 --> 15:33.040
- We're huge fans.
- Huge.

15:33.207 --> 15:35.834
They've set up a table for us
in the private room. Shall we?

15:36.043 --> 15:38.837
No, I'll just finish this
and be right along.

15:39.046 --> 15:41.256
Perhaps the two doctors
will keep me company.

15:41.465 --> 15:47.387
I'd love to hear a psychological
interpretation of the play.

15:47.596 --> 15:49.806
All right, but don't be too long.

15:50.057 --> 15:54.811
So tell me,
as students of the human psyche,

15:55.062 --> 15:57.606
did my character ring true?

15:58.649 --> 16:00.233
Oh, yes, so true.

16:00.609 --> 16:04.279
I can honestly say
I never saw a false moment.

16:06.156 --> 16:07.991
Well, what about the third act?

16:08.241 --> 16:11.119
The play clearly
has a third-act problem.

16:11.328 --> 16:12.746
At least it has a third act,

16:12.913 --> 16:16.208
<i>unlike The Silent Echo
which really could have used one.</i>

16:19.503 --> 16:20.587
I quite agree.

16:20.837 --> 16:24.216
<i>I did The Silent Echo
in London last year.</i>

16:24.424 --> 16:26.968
What did you think
of the hat scene?

16:31.681 --> 16:33.224
The hat scene. Well...

16:33.433 --> 16:36.144
You know, the most important thing
about the hat scene,

16:36.353 --> 16:38.646
and I have to stress this...
Dear God, is that clock right?

16:38.855 --> 16:42.650
I have to call the sitter and tell her I'm
going to be late, the children worry so.

16:44.360 --> 16:47.906
- Well, back to the play.
- Right.

16:48.114 --> 16:50.074
Well, you, of course, were brilliant.

16:50.283 --> 16:54.162
Oh, please, Dr. Crane, I just want

16:54.370 --> 16:57.624
your professional analysis
of what you saw tonight.

17:00.293 --> 17:02.629
Well, it...

17:03.796 --> 17:08.468
Of course, I could discuss subtext,
metaphor and imagery with you,

17:08.635 --> 17:10.553
but you see, I...

17:10.720 --> 17:13.056
I come to the theatre

17:13.222 --> 17:15.223
to feel,

17:15.391 --> 17:17.352
to be moved.

17:17.560 --> 17:21.564
And that's exactly
what happened to me tonight.

17:21.814 --> 17:23.523
Really?

17:24.567 --> 17:26.569
When?

17:32.492 --> 17:35.244
When? Well, let me see.

17:35.453 --> 17:39.498
It was... There was that...

17:40.082 --> 17:41.375
The gutting-the-fish scene.

17:42.919 --> 17:46.756
You made
the most heartbreaking gesture.

17:46.922 --> 17:50.718
It was, you know,

17:51.510 --> 17:54.347
the one with your hands. You...

17:57.683 --> 18:00.853
You mean,
when I offer the fish to my son,

18:01.020 --> 18:05.983
and he turns his back to me,
and I reach out to him like this:

18:06.192 --> 18:10.070
Yes, it's even more moving
the second time.

18:10.279 --> 18:11.614
Well...

18:11.780 --> 18:16.368
Who knows why a moment like that
touches us so? But...

18:17.661 --> 18:20.748
You see, that is your gift, Sir Trevor.

18:21.916 --> 18:23.917
You've given us

18:24.126 --> 18:26.253
hundreds of moments.

18:26.462 --> 18:30.632
Moments so real, so compelling,

18:30.799 --> 18:34.636
that we are revealed in their truth.

18:36.305 --> 18:39.683
You don't know
how refreshing this is

18:39.892 --> 18:42.186
to meet someone
who doesn't just come to the theatre

18:42.394 --> 18:45.355
but who gives himself over to it.

18:45.564 --> 18:49.151
That crowd in there, they only come
because it's fashionable.

18:49.401 --> 18:51.111
They don't care about art.

18:51.320 --> 18:53.739
I can spot them at a glance.

18:54.907 --> 18:57.618
The poseurs, the frauds.

18:57.826 --> 19:00.579
Oh, here comes your brother.

19:03.915 --> 19:05.167
The kids are fine.

19:08.920 --> 19:11.673
Excuse me, Sir Trevor, they're waiting
for you in the dining room.

19:11.882 --> 19:13.550
Very well.

19:13.759 --> 19:20.557
And thank you, Dr. Crane,
for your integrity and your passion.

19:22.100 --> 19:26.062
You are the reason that actors act.

19:35.363 --> 19:38.408
I'm sorry I deserted you,
but obviously you carried the day.

19:38.617 --> 19:42.495
- Bravo.
- Oh, yes, bravo for us.

19:43.955 --> 19:45.749
What do you mean?

19:45.957 --> 19:47.792
Do you realise
what we missed tonight?

19:48.460 --> 19:51.588
A potentially life-changing experience
in the theatre.

19:51.796 --> 19:53.673
And why?

19:53.882 --> 19:58.178
Because we were too embarrassed
to be seen in a cancellation line.

19:58.386 --> 20:01.139
Well, admittedly, it was a bit shallow.

20:01.306 --> 20:05.018
Yes, it was more than shallow,
it was shameful.

20:06.186 --> 20:07.937
You're right.

20:08.146 --> 20:09.147
What were we thinking,

20:09.314 --> 20:11.900
kowtowing to a group of snobs
like that?

20:12.150 --> 20:15.153
We weren't thinking.
Come on, let's get out of here.

20:15.403 --> 20:17.113
Frasier, Niles.

20:17.322 --> 20:19.866
Oh, Susan, I'm so sorry,
but we can't stay.

20:20.074 --> 20:22.618
Oh, no.
Sir Trevor will be so disappointed.

20:22.827 --> 20:24.579
He was quite taken with you.

20:25.580 --> 20:27.999
Well, send him our apologies.

20:28.166 --> 20:30.001
It really was wonderful to meet him.

20:30.918 --> 20:33.421
I know this is short notice,
but if you're free this weekend,

20:33.588 --> 20:35.590
we're having
one of our Sunday brunches.

20:35.840 --> 20:39.552
Senator Logan is coming
and Maria de Falco and the Whitneys...

20:39.760 --> 20:42.555
- Just thank you, but I'm afraid we...
- Oh, please try.

20:42.763 --> 20:46.767
I'll hold it open for you.
Check your books and let me know.

20:50.980 --> 20:53.816
Well, how's that for irony?

20:54.025 --> 20:55.651
Sunday brunch at the Kendalls'.

20:55.860 --> 20:57.903
An hour ago, we would have leapt
at that invitation.

20:58.112 --> 21:00.031
Not anymore.

21:00.197 --> 21:03.951
We've got a damned sight
too much integrity.

21:07.538 --> 21:09.415
Although...

21:11.125 --> 21:12.793
Are we being selfish?

21:13.043 --> 21:15.838
- Possibly. How?
- Here's my thinking.

21:16.463 --> 21:18.340
Why do shallow people
remain that way?

21:18.549 --> 21:20.801
The lack of positive influence.

21:21.051 --> 21:23.387
Perhaps our brand of integrity
is what that group needs.

21:23.554 --> 21:26.181
We can be like politicians who
change the system from within.

21:26.390 --> 21:29.393
Exactly. And who knows?
Maybe it'll rub off on Senator Logan.

21:29.560 --> 21:31.729
- He'll bring it back to Washington.
- We have to go.

21:31.979 --> 21:33.230
Yes. What are you wearing?

21:33.397 --> 21:37.818
- I'm gonna wear my new Prada suit.
- You're a fashion plate and a patriot.
