one of the kids you gave book reports to.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
What would be the harm?

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
They don't need the library like you.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
All they need is a passing grade.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
They don't care about story.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
They don't care about literary symbolism!

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
They don't respect books!

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
But why? Why did you do it?

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
I was worried... once you finished the series,

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
I'd have nobody else to talk to about books.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
Nobody else talks to me about books,

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
unless they want me to do a report for them.
