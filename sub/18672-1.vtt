01:17.411 --> 01:20.121
I keep nothing but a few
photographs in the bathroom

01:20.748 --> 01:22.874
of myself at an earlier time.

01:26.003 --> 01:30.214
The first shows me at the age of 25,
looking rather anxious.

01:30.424 --> 01:33.092
I've just bought a large house
in the country

01:33.594 --> 01:35.136
and cannot afford it.

01:36.096 --> 01:40.767
Here you see the young author
of Williwaw at the age of 19,

01:41.351 --> 01:43.060
still in uniform.

01:44.480 --> 01:46.939
Here, above the bathtub,
in the place of honor,

01:47.149 --> 01:50.443
are the debates
with William Buckley in 1968.

01:50.652 --> 01:53.404
He was a well known
right-wing commentator

01:53.697 --> 01:56.199
whose name seldom passes my lips.

02:22.518 --> 02:24.519
Cameras, please. Cameras.

02:25.312 --> 02:26.729
William F. Buckley.

02:30.984 --> 02:32.860
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.

02:34.488 --> 02:36.155
That was a very nice introduction.

02:38.116 --> 02:39.367
On the other hand,
if it hadn't been,

02:39.451 --> 02:41.202
I would've smashed you
in the goddamn face.

02:50.796 --> 02:52.463
I do this so well...

02:53.298 --> 02:54.715
and so terminally,

02:55.008 --> 02:59.595
I have left the bleeding corpse
of William F. Buckley, Jr.

03:00.138 --> 03:03.099
on the floor of
the convention hall in Chicago.

03:04.685 --> 03:06.519
I would definitely have
Gore Vidal and Bill Buckley

03:06.687 --> 03:07.979
on my television show.

03:08.146 --> 03:11.315
I would guess that the rematch
of the great conflict

03:11.483 --> 03:14.193
would attract people precisely
because it held out

03:14.570 --> 03:16.863
- the possibility of something--
- Violence.

03:18.407 --> 03:20.366
- Camera speeding.
- Action.

03:34.089 --> 03:36.048
In the 60's

03:36.300 --> 03:40.511
the institution in which
Americans had the greatest confidence

03:40.804 --> 03:42.346
was television news.

03:49.104 --> 03:51.772
Split-second organization
on a worldwide scale,

03:52.149 --> 03:55.401
speed and efficiency in
the nerve centers of NBC News.

03:55.736 --> 03:59.363
News was this big, bland center

03:59.531 --> 04:02.825
that determined for us
what America was.

04:02.993 --> 04:06.037
Which was white, Anglo-Saxon,

04:06.204 --> 04:08.456
there were never any vowels
at the end of the names.

04:08.707 --> 04:10.166
Chet Huntley and
David Brinkley

04:10.459 --> 04:11.876
still are the team supreme

04:12.044 --> 04:13.794
in the art of easygoing commentary.

04:15.255 --> 04:18.882
Networks, did they deal
in controversy? No!

04:19.343 --> 04:21.761
Did they invite controversy? No!

04:22.846 --> 04:25.139
They were in the center.

04:25.515 --> 04:28.267
They were cementers of idea,

04:28.435 --> 04:31.520
not disrupters of idea.

04:31.730 --> 04:34.690
This is the CBS Evening
News with Walter Cronkite.

04:34.858 --> 04:37.193
Good evening from our CBS newsroom
in New York.

04:37.361 --> 04:39.236
NBC and CBS
were fighting for the lead

04:39.404 --> 04:41.656
and ABC was clearly number three.

04:43.700 --> 04:47.620
The other two networks were doing
full coverage at the conventions,

04:48.455 --> 04:49.830
gavel-to-gavel.

04:52.834 --> 04:55.920
Turn the cameras and microphones on
and let them roll.

04:57.965 --> 05:02.426
And ABC had less money to spend
on these things.

05:03.303 --> 05:08.766
So, in 1968 ABC went to the truncated
version of convention coverage

05:08.934 --> 05:11.811
to do an hour and a half
from 9:30 to 11:00 at night.

05:12.604 --> 05:16.440
They didn't have Cronkite,
didn't have Huntley and Brinkley.

05:16.817 --> 05:19.568
They didn't have the standards.

05:19.903 --> 05:21.696
Cameras, please. Cameras.

05:29.287 --> 05:32.456
ABC was the third
of the three networks.

05:36.294 --> 05:38.421
Would've been fourth,
but there were only three.

05:39.172 --> 05:41.215
They had the weaker programming.

05:42.801 --> 05:45.469
Somebody famously said
that the way to end the Vietnam war

05:45.637 --> 05:48.848
was to put it on ABC and
it'd be canceled in 13 weeks.

05:52.436 --> 05:56.397
In order to be competitive,
with the 1968 convention,

05:56.857 --> 06:00.776
ABC needed something.
Provocative.

06:01.028 --> 06:02.611
A media event.

06:02.821 --> 06:05.656
And they settled on
Buckley and Vidal.

06:13.290 --> 06:15.583
It wasn't necessarily sensible.

06:16.668 --> 06:18.252
It was a shot in the dark.

06:19.046 --> 06:23.257
And it changed television... forever.

06:27.179 --> 06:29.472
Why are the races unreconciled?

06:29.639 --> 06:31.557
Why does poverty persevere?

06:31.725 --> 06:33.059
Why are the young disenchanted?

06:33.226 --> 06:35.519
Why do the birds sing so unhappily?

06:35.896 --> 06:37.605
It is easy to be carried away.

06:37.773 --> 06:40.816
And yet always there is
a strain of seriousness,

06:40.984 --> 06:42.568
something in the system
that warns us.

06:42.736 --> 06:45.905
Warns us that America had better
strike out on a different course,

06:46.073 --> 06:48.574
rather than face another
four years of asphyxiation

06:48.742 --> 06:49.825
by liberal premises.

06:50.619 --> 06:53.579
This is William F. Buckley, Jr.
in New York.

06:54.623 --> 06:57.041
Perfect.

06:58.085 --> 07:00.669
This is the William
F. Buckley America knows best.

07:00.837 --> 07:03.672
Grimacing or incredulous
or disdainful.

07:04.091 --> 07:06.550
Readying himself
for a deceptively quiet attack

07:06.718 --> 07:08.803
on his intellectual prey
of the moment.

07:09.721 --> 07:12.348
This is the William F. Buckley
Barry Goldwater insists

07:12.516 --> 07:14.308
fills a crying national need.

07:14.476 --> 07:17.520
We want Buckley!
We want Buckley!

07:20.440 --> 07:22.149
William F. Buckley, Jr.

07:22.400 --> 07:25.402
has a strong
definite opinion on every subject.

07:25.904 --> 07:28.239
So, wherever he goes,
he has to have an answer

07:28.406 --> 07:29.907
about every question.

07:30.534 --> 07:31.784
Do you think
America doesn't

07:31.952 --> 07:33.369
believe in itself
as much as it used to?

07:33.745 --> 07:34.995
Yes, I think that's true.

07:35.539 --> 07:39.834
I think it's happening
because of a restlessness

07:40.001 --> 07:42.795
for so long,
as liberalism suggested,

07:42.963 --> 07:45.381
that it could bring
happiness to the individual.

07:45.841 --> 07:48.050
Then people tended to look
to government agencies

07:48.260 --> 07:52.763
for those narcotic substitutes
for a search for happiness

07:53.098 --> 07:56.058
and contentment, which they ought
to have found in their religion,

07:56.226 --> 07:58.018
in their institutions
and their culture themselves.

08:02.899 --> 08:06.402
Buckley was the first
modern conservative intellectual

08:06.570 --> 08:10.656
to see that ideological debates
were cultural debates.

08:10.824 --> 08:15.536
And what he did was to put
conservatism on the march.

08:15.787 --> 08:18.664
And that's the creation of
the movement that we have today.

08:19.916 --> 08:23.252
He's stimulating.
He's exhausting. He's fun.

08:24.129 --> 08:28.424
Sometimes I could kill him...
but not too often.

08:29.092 --> 08:31.802
He could've been
the playboy of the Western world

08:31.970 --> 08:36.807
but he chose to be the St. Paul
of the conservative movement.

08:38.226 --> 08:39.476
Most work days,
he winds up

08:39.644 --> 08:41.604
in the offices of
the National Review,

08:41.770 --> 08:43.355
his journal
of conservative opinion

08:43.523 --> 08:48.110
which reaches 110,000 subscribers
and is read by many more.

08:51.114 --> 08:53.949
National Review
is the most influential

08:54.117 --> 08:55.743
magazine of our time.

08:56.494 --> 08:59.872
Why?
The magazine attached to a movement.

09:01.708 --> 09:04.418
My brother, Bill,
he was a conservative,

09:04.586 --> 09:06.712
right-wing libertarian Christian.

09:07.005 --> 09:08.380
That's what he was.

09:10.008 --> 09:13.052
But most of all,
Bill was a revolutionary.

09:14.596 --> 09:17.389
When the people at ABC
had first approached Bill,

09:17.641 --> 09:19.475
they had asked him would he
be willing to be

09:19.643 --> 09:23.479
the conservative debater commentator
with the national conventions.

09:23.647 --> 09:25.147
And he said, yes, he would.

09:25.315 --> 09:27.399
And they asked him, "Well, is there
anybody you wouldn't go on with?"

09:27.567 --> 09:30.819
And he said, "Well, I would
refuse to go on with a Communist."

09:31.196 --> 09:34.907
"And, apart from that, the only one
I can think of is Gore Vidal."

09:36.618 --> 09:38.118
Camera's rolling.

09:38.411 --> 09:41.372
Men and women
who are sexually repressed

09:41.539 --> 09:46.877
regard all sexual pleasure as
"dirty," "evil," "the devil's work."

09:47.254 --> 09:50.047
Yet we are all prostitutes
in one sense or another,

09:50.215 --> 09:51.674
ethically, if not sexually.

09:52.634 --> 09:55.261
For Buckley, Vidal was the devil.

09:55.428 --> 10:01.809
He represented everything
that was going to moral hell...

10:03.812 --> 10:06.522
that was degenerative
about the country.

10:07.190 --> 10:11.944
A cultural war has now joined
the race war in the United States.

10:12.904 --> 10:16.031
And the change
is going to be very difficult.

10:16.199 --> 10:19.076
And as our own
Thomas Jefferson once said,

10:19.244 --> 10:22.246
"The tree of liberty must
occasionally be watered with blood."

10:24.624 --> 10:28.127
In a sense, this was the beginning
of a war between an old order

10:28.295 --> 10:30.587
and what I hoped
would be a new order.

10:34.968 --> 10:37.177
Gore didn't just see
rioting in the streets,

10:37.387 --> 10:39.388
he saw revolution breaking out.

10:41.683 --> 10:44.184
Remember, Gore Vidal
was always an iconoclast.

10:45.061 --> 10:48.230
An apostate.
A writer against the grain.

10:49.858 --> 10:53.277
And he saw Buckley and his ideas
as anti-Democratic.

10:53.820 --> 10:58.073
If Buckley were not taken out,
his ideas would take down the nation.

10:59.367 --> 11:04.079
It occurred to me that the central
drive in human beings is power.

11:05.373 --> 11:08.167
And that has always been my theme,
that ideal in politics,

11:08.335 --> 11:10.419
which is an obvious
manifestation of power.

11:12.213 --> 11:14.173
Gore Vidal is one of
America's most successful

11:14.341 --> 11:15.674
and distinguished writers.

11:16.301 --> 11:19.303
He also lives in a personal cloud
of outrageous legends.

11:19.721 --> 11:22.556
After the early books, which first
brought him to the public eye,

11:22.974 --> 11:25.768
came a group of highly praised
historical novels

11:25.935 --> 11:27.311
which sold in the millions.

11:27.687 --> 11:30.689
But it was Myra Breckinridge
that confirmed Vidal's place

11:30.940 --> 11:34.401
as the enfant terrible of the
respectable American literary scene.

11:34.778 --> 11:38.113
By 1968, he had just
published a bombshell of a book,

11:38.281 --> 11:41.450
his greatest satire, and, I think,
one of the greatest satires written

11:41.618 --> 11:43.285
in English, Myra Breckinridge.

11:44.746 --> 11:46.663
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

11:46.831 --> 11:49.333
what you've all been waiting for...

11:49.542 --> 11:51.001
The book that couldn't be written

11:51.169 --> 11:54.463
is now the motion picture
that couldn't be made:

11:54.631 --> 11:56.673
Myra Breckinridge.

11:58.343 --> 12:01.261
He'd gotten, you know,
the cover of TIME magazine for it.

12:01.429 --> 12:03.305
And his career
was soaring at the time.

12:03.473 --> 12:06.266
But, it was edgy material.

12:06.851 --> 12:08.811
I don't know where Myra came from.

12:08.978 --> 12:12.022
I really was like the character,
each day wondering what Myra would do

12:12.190 --> 12:15.401
and roaring with laughter as this
thing presented herself to me.

12:17.153 --> 12:18.404
Gentlemen...

12:20.031 --> 12:22.116
I am Myron Breckinridge.

12:22.700 --> 12:25.077
Uncle Buck, your fag nephew
became your niece

12:25.245 --> 12:28.580
two years ago in Copenhagen,
and is now free as a bird

12:28.748 --> 12:32.626
and happy in being the most
extraordinary woman in the world!

12:33.545 --> 12:36.713
And suddenly, it occurred to me,
about sexual relations.

12:36.881 --> 12:40.592
How indeed much of it is based
not upon any pleasure principle,

12:40.760 --> 12:41.969
or even a procreative one,

12:42.470 --> 12:44.888
but of people
gaining power over others.

12:45.056 --> 12:46.557
Ah-ha! Gotcha!

12:47.058 --> 12:51.270
And so I conceived
of my androgynous protagonist

12:52.647 --> 12:55.190
who is a man who becomes a woman
who becomes a man.

12:55.900 --> 12:58.026
A transsexual seducing men,

12:58.194 --> 13:00.279
or in one case,
I believe, raping a man...

13:00.447 --> 13:02.865
Yay-haa!

13:03.450 --> 13:04.575
Uh...

13:06.286 --> 13:07.995
The themes of Myra Breckinridge,

13:08.163 --> 13:10.289
and also sexuality
and transsexuality,

13:10.457 --> 13:11.999
was way ahead of its time

13:12.167 --> 13:13.750
and got under Bill Buckley's skin.

13:16.337 --> 13:21.258
Mr. Buckley, did you see the film
Myra Breckinridge, and why not?

13:23.595 --> 13:25.721
That told the people at ABC:

13:25.889 --> 13:28.432
"Wow, we have a chance
for some great theater here!

13:28.600 --> 13:29.892
Let's get Gore Vidal."

13:35.315 --> 13:39.485
Gore Vidal is a whore of debate.

13:39.903 --> 13:43.197
And when it comes to values
of our country,

13:43.740 --> 13:45.240
and of historical forces,

13:45.408 --> 13:47.367
the man is brilliant.

13:48.119 --> 13:50.996
And the man is fun to watch.

13:51.789 --> 13:55.459
But there is always a residue,
in my opinion,

13:55.835 --> 13:58.378
when I watch him,
of nausea.

14:01.174 --> 14:03.300
I didn't say anything nasty
about him, did I?

14:06.304 --> 14:07.679
It is under... No.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.765
All right.

14:16.689 --> 14:18.732
It is understandable
that the Republicans decided

14:18.942 --> 14:21.693
to hold their convention
south of the Mason-Dixon line.

14:22.028 --> 14:24.821
They had not done so in 104 years.

14:25.114 --> 14:29.034
And it is obvious why anyone
might want to come to Miami Beach.

14:29.786 --> 14:32.371
But the real reasons for
the Republican presence here

14:32.539 --> 14:35.207
are less obvious.
And I blew that one. Let's--

14:45.468 --> 14:49.721
This nine-mile-long sandbar
has one advantage above all others,

14:49.889 --> 14:51.014
it is remote.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.809
It's therefore easy
for the Republicans

14:53.977 --> 14:56.853
to avoid the danger of large,
militant demonstrations.

15:03.861 --> 15:06.697
There's a huge, almost empty
convention hall down there

15:06.864 --> 15:09.783
waiting for
the 1968 Republican convention.

15:09.951 --> 15:13.495
There's very little work left to do
before the first gavel on Monday.

15:16.916 --> 15:21.044
Every political convention has
features no other before it has had.

15:21.212 --> 15:23.213
What's going to be distinctive
about this one?

15:23.381 --> 15:26.091
First of all, this is the first one
available to the public

15:26.259 --> 15:28.051
completely in beautiful color,

15:28.219 --> 15:30.387
and lady delegates have received
careful instructions

15:30.597 --> 15:33.932
about how to dress so as
to appear vivid, but not garish.

15:40.106 --> 15:42.065
Bill Buckley took off
for a week sailing

15:42.233 --> 15:44.484
before the Republican
National Convention.

15:45.153 --> 15:47.487
They sailed down to Cozumel.

15:48.197 --> 15:51.366
I would be rather surprised
if he did any special preparation

15:51.576 --> 15:53.869
for this encounter with Gore Vidal.

15:54.579 --> 15:56.496
Buckley expected this to be

15:56.664 --> 16:01.793
an opportunity to debate the issues,
to have some fun.

16:01.961 --> 16:05.297
He was not prepared for Mr. Vidal.

16:06.341 --> 16:08.634
Gore told me he hired a researcher.

16:08.801 --> 16:13.388
He wanted to paint National Review
as being racist,

16:13.556 --> 16:15.849
if he could, anti-Semitic.

16:16.893 --> 16:21.396
I don't think he was really
interested in conducting a debate

16:21.939 --> 16:25.025
about the issues
or about the parties

16:25.193 --> 16:28.779
or about the policies or about
the platforms of the two parties.

16:28.946 --> 16:32.449
What he wanted to do
was to expose Bill Buckley.

16:39.540 --> 16:42.459
Their confrontation
is about lifestyle,

16:43.586 --> 16:46.380
what kind of people should we be.

16:47.382 --> 16:50.759
Their real argument,
in front of the public,

16:51.177 --> 16:53.303
is "who is the better person."

16:56.683 --> 17:01.144
In one minute, A Second Look
with William Buckley and Gore Vidal.

17:04.440 --> 17:07.483
Across from us
was Howard K. Smith.

17:08.027 --> 17:11.238
Suave, intelligent,
madly apprehensive.

17:11.406 --> 17:14.825
Rehearsing with his lips the lines
he would presently deliver.

17:15.410 --> 17:18.869
Thirty, 40, 50 technicians,
reporters, directors

17:19.247 --> 17:20.747
filled the enormous room,

17:21.415 --> 17:24.501
at one corner of which,
earphones attached,

17:24.836 --> 17:27.796
Vidal and I awaited
the sound of the bell.

17:29.716 --> 17:30.841
From past experience, I knew

17:31.050 --> 17:33.719
that Buckley
would have done no research.

17:34.470 --> 17:37.222
That what facts he had at his command
would be jumbled

17:37.390 --> 17:39.391
by the strangest syntax.

17:41.144 --> 17:42.936
We'd exchanged minimal amenities.

17:43.104 --> 17:47.399
And I scribbled on my clipboard to
avoid having to banter with him.

17:47.984 --> 17:49.818
And he did the same.

17:50.486 --> 17:52.320
For all their
ideological differences,

17:52.488 --> 17:54.072
they both see what the problem is.

17:54.240 --> 17:56.450
That America can't stay
on the course it's on.

17:56.617 --> 17:58.869
And that the country's
being split at the seams.

17:59.746 --> 18:01.872
And each has staked out his position

18:02.039 --> 18:08.128
in ways that portend where our
country is divided right now.

18:12.300 --> 18:14.634
To help us extract meaning
from these conventions,

18:14.802 --> 18:17.971
two of America's most eloquent
and most decided commentators

18:18.139 --> 18:19.556
have joined us this year.

18:19.724 --> 18:23.769
They are Gore Vidal
and William F. Buckley, Jr.

18:23.936 --> 18:27.189
Can Mr. Vidal
assess the Republicans for us?

18:27.774 --> 18:32.402
Can a political party based almost
entirely upon human greed

18:33.154 --> 18:35.447
nominate anyone for President

18:35.615 --> 18:38.700
for whom a majority
of the American people would vote?

18:40.369 --> 18:42.579
May I comment, Mr. Smith?

18:42.747 --> 18:43.830
- Please do.
- Yeah.

18:43.998 --> 18:48.919
It seems to me that the author
of Myra Breckinridge

18:49.086 --> 18:51.588
is well acquainted with
the imperatives of human greed.

18:52.006 --> 18:54.007
Well, I would like to say,
Bill, if I may--

18:54.175 --> 18:57.177
If I may say, Bill,
before you go any further,

18:57.345 --> 19:01.515
I would like to say if there were a
contest for Mr. Myra Breckinridge

19:01.682 --> 19:03.225
you would unquestionably win it.

19:03.392 --> 19:05.936
I based her entire style
polemically upon you:

19:06.103 --> 19:07.479
passionate and irrelevant.

19:07.647 --> 19:14.361
Now, my point is that for Mr. Vidal
to contend a particular party

19:14.529 --> 19:16.613
as engaged in the pursuit
of human greed,

19:16.781 --> 19:19.658
requires us to understand
his rather eccentric definitions.

19:19.826 --> 19:21.618
Is it greedy really
for a people to suggest

19:21.786 --> 19:24.496
that what matters to poor people
is that they have houses?

19:24.664 --> 19:26.998
Is it really greedy to want to
preserve our freedom?

19:27.166 --> 19:32.254
We have the luxury of being able
to focus on those who are poor

19:32.421 --> 19:34.548
in our midst as though we can
do something about it.

19:34.715 --> 19:36.091
Which is something
that no other country

19:36.259 --> 19:38.885
less occupied with human greed has--

19:39.053 --> 19:42.180
The nice thing about the Republican
party is that every four years

19:42.348 --> 19:44.766
after denigrating the poor
amongst themselves,

19:44.934 --> 19:47.143
referring to them as "freeloaders,"
"they don't want to work,"

19:47.311 --> 19:49.271
and I have many quotes here
from Ronald Reagan.

19:49.438 --> 19:52.566
And then every four years you get
this sort of crocodile tears

19:52.733 --> 19:55.110
for the poor people
because they need their vote.

19:55.278 --> 19:58.947
It is quite true that Reagan is
capable of talking about freeloaders,

19:59.115 --> 20:02.367
so am I,
because there are freeloaders.

20:02.535 --> 20:07.163
It is one thing to say that
a society ought to concern itself

20:07.331 --> 20:08.957
with the plight of its poor.
I think the Republican party

20:09.125 --> 20:10.250
is saying that.

20:10.459 --> 20:11.751
Perhaps the Republican party
should have

20:11.919 --> 20:14.921
a platform on how to deal with Vidal.

20:15.089 --> 20:17.757
If absolutely necessary, I will write
it for them, but meanwhile--

20:17.925 --> 20:20.760
Meanwhile, I'd be very, very nervous.
You have written lately of your

20:20.928 --> 20:23.388
intimacy with Reagan and with Nixon

20:23.556 --> 20:25.682
and that you've discussed
the Vietnam War with them

20:25.850 --> 20:27.809
and that you are satisfied
with their positions.

20:27.977 --> 20:31.855
Since you're in favor of the nuclear
bombing of North Vietnam,

20:32.023 --> 20:35.817
I'd be very worried about
your kind of odd neurosis--

20:35.985 --> 20:39.613
Or more like neurosis being a friend
of anybody who might be a president.

20:39.780 --> 20:42.032
I've never advocated the nuclear
bombing of North Vietnam.

20:42.366 --> 20:45.619
You have, and I'll give you
time and place even.

20:45.953 --> 20:47.662
- Well, you won't, because I never--
- I will.

20:47.830 --> 20:49.414
I will if we don't mind.
The record--

20:49.582 --> 20:51.625
No, now wait a minute,
don't duck away from the record.

20:51.792 --> 20:55.086
You suggested the atom bombing
of the north of Vietnam

20:55.254 --> 20:57.339
in your little magazine,
which I do not read,

20:57.506 --> 21:01.051
but I'm told about,
on February 23, 1968.

21:01.218 --> 21:02.719
So you're very hawkish.

21:02.887 --> 21:05.764
And now, if both Nixon and Reagan
are listening to you,

21:05.932 --> 21:07.557
I'm very worried for the country.

21:07.725 --> 21:10.518
Now, it seems to me that
the Republican party

21:10.686 --> 21:14.189
has shown a record of greater
sobriety than Mr. Vidal,

21:14.357 --> 21:17.067
who boasts of not reading something
which he has prepared to misquote

21:17.234 --> 21:18.902
in the presence of the person
who edits this.

21:19.070 --> 21:22.572
Now, Bill Buckley,
if the quotation is exact...

21:22.740 --> 21:26.826
Now don't be... We know your
tendency is to be feline, Mr. Vidal,

21:27.119 --> 21:30.789
but just relax for a moment
and think very simply on this.

21:30.957 --> 21:34.209
I have not advocated...
I'm not horrified at the prospect.

21:34.377 --> 21:36.670
Bill, I just quoted where you said
these things and where.

21:36.837 --> 21:39.506
- Are you saying you didn't say them?
- I'm saying that I didn't say them.

21:39.674 --> 21:41.883
- You're taking them back?
- That your misquotation--

21:42.051 --> 21:44.511
Tune in this time tomorrow night
and we will have further evidence

21:44.679 --> 21:47.263
of Bill Buckley,
cold warrior turned hot.

21:47.431 --> 21:49.182
Right, and about the human greed
of everybody in the world

21:49.350 --> 21:51.601
- except yourself.
- There are saints.

21:51.769 --> 21:53.979
Tomorrow, what Mr. Vidal
thinks about the Kennedys.

21:54.146 --> 21:56.106
Good night, and let me tell you.

21:57.274 --> 21:58.817
Excuse me, gentlemen.

21:59.026 --> 22:01.319
It's been very enjoyable
hearing you articulate

22:01.487 --> 22:03.571
two points of view.
Thank you very much indeed.

22:03.739 --> 22:06.032
I think I detected some
unfinished lines of thought.

22:06.200 --> 22:08.493
We'll have time to follow them
through tomorrow.

22:08.661 --> 22:11.997
And tomorrow. And tomorrow.
Every night, we...

22:12.206 --> 22:14.374
There's nothing feigned
about the mutual antipathy.

22:15.376 --> 22:17.585
They really do despise one another.

22:18.713 --> 22:21.089
Each thought that the other
was quite dangerous.

22:21.507 --> 22:25.135
And it was drawn from quite a deep
well in both cases.

22:25.845 --> 22:28.638
Gore Vidal and William Buckley
first clashed,

22:28.806 --> 22:34.019
almost by proxy, in 1962
on The Jack Paar Program.

22:34.478 --> 22:36.062
Vidal had gone on Jack Paar's show

22:36.230 --> 22:38.732
and they both started
mocking Buckley:

22:38.899 --> 22:42.986
his eccentric mannerisms,
the voice,

22:43.154 --> 22:45.905
the facial tics, all the rest.

22:46.407 --> 22:48.324
So, in effect,
Buckley was given equal time.

22:48.492 --> 22:50.744
And he went on Jack Paar's show.

22:50.953 --> 22:56.750
And Paar expected that kind of
troglodyte Neanderthal

22:56.917 --> 23:01.880
man-of-the-right whom Vidal had
caricatured on the program.

23:02.048 --> 23:05.884
And instead,
you have this genius of debate.

23:06.677 --> 23:09.387
And Paar was stunned.

23:11.682 --> 23:14.684
We next met in San Francisco, 1964,

23:14.852 --> 23:17.228
during the Goldwater convention.

23:17.396 --> 23:20.523
I confessed to having prepared
a trap for Buckley.

23:20.691 --> 23:22.692
I egged him on.

23:22.860 --> 23:25.111
The next day, Buckley sent me
a letter to the effect

23:25.279 --> 23:27.363
that he never wanted to see me again.

23:28.074 --> 23:31.284
I found this sentiment agreeable.

23:33.329 --> 23:36.456
Buckley was eager
to be on television.

23:37.374 --> 23:41.669
The downside of it for Gore was that
he contributed to Buckley's...

23:42.463 --> 23:44.881
becoming an onscreen celebrity.

23:49.804 --> 23:52.722
Mr. Buckley,
read by many, but not that many,

23:52.890 --> 23:55.058
would be nothing if it wasn't for
his program Firing Line.

23:55.226 --> 23:57.811
Buckley sat in his chair
with a clipboard

23:57.978 --> 24:02.440
and would invite left-wingers
or liberals on his program,

24:02.608 --> 24:05.026
and they would go back and forth
for half an hour.

24:05.194 --> 24:08.238
People on the left are
more law-abiding than anybody else.

24:08.405 --> 24:10.323
That's why they're on the left.

24:10.616 --> 24:12.242
- Explain that, would you?
- I'd be happy to.

24:12.409 --> 24:14.202
You're marvelous. I adore you.

24:14.411 --> 24:15.787
You're the only man
who can ask your question,

24:15.955 --> 24:18.248
and convict the man
before he can answer the question.

24:18.916 --> 24:21.459
Television was happy to have Bill

24:21.627 --> 24:24.379
because everybody else
was saying the same thing.

24:24.547 --> 24:28.424
From my point of view,
what Elijah Muhammad is doing to you

24:28.592 --> 24:31.719
is diseasing your mind.

24:31.887 --> 24:37.767
You sit and tell me that we white
people like to divide and conquer.

24:37.935 --> 24:39.769
- You do.
- I grew up as a white child,

24:39.937 --> 24:43.398
I heard much more talk against Democrats
than I did against black people.

24:43.941 --> 24:47.735
When he began Firing Line
he did it in part to show off.

24:47.903 --> 24:50.697
But he actually did just what
pundit television should do.

24:50.906 --> 24:54.117
Which is he elevated the discourse
and he educated people through it.

24:58.455 --> 25:01.332
On the eve of the Republican
Convention, the heat is on.

25:01.500 --> 25:03.918
We bring you a report
on who did what to whom

25:04.086 --> 25:05.587
in the last hours before the gavel.

25:05.754 --> 25:09.340
Plus commentary and some dissent
from our guest commentators:

25:09.508 --> 25:10.800
author Gore Vidal...

25:10.968 --> 25:13.052
ABC's unconventional
convention coverage

25:13.220 --> 25:15.471
was a subject of ridicule

25:15.639 --> 25:19.184
as we were abdicating our
journalistic responsibility.

25:19.852 --> 25:23.730
But if the goal was to raise
ABC News' visibility,

25:24.398 --> 25:26.107
we certainly succeeded.

25:28.110 --> 25:29.402
Everybody watched the news.

25:29.570 --> 25:32.697
Nearly 80 percent of the country
watched coverage

25:32.865 --> 25:35.575
of the Republican and Democratic
conventions in 1968.

25:38.245 --> 25:39.662
We're going live
to the West Coast

25:39.872 --> 25:41.414
in about six or seven minutes.

25:41.582 --> 25:44.626
And then, ABC News' studio collapsed.

25:54.178 --> 25:57.722
The lighting grid fell down
onto the floor of the set.

25:59.433 --> 26:01.100
And the roof fell in...
...literally.

26:01.268 --> 26:03.478
It was built inside the arena.

26:03.646 --> 26:05.063
Hard hats on.

26:05.481 --> 26:10.151
ABC was really the Budget car rental
of television news.

26:10.319 --> 26:14.155
Pieces of the ceiling start flying,
and then all of a sudden,

26:14.323 --> 26:16.491
the whole thing started giving away.

26:17.952 --> 26:20.453
Mr. Lower, ABC promised to be
unconventional this year

26:20.621 --> 26:24.457
- but this is ridiculous.
- We're gonna be unconventional, Sam.

26:24.541 --> 26:25.667
I can tell you that.

26:26.126 --> 26:28.378
Thank you very much.
Now let's just cut it.

26:40.975 --> 26:42.934
This is Miami, day one.

26:43.102 --> 26:46.354
From Miami Beach,
ABC News presents...

26:47.022 --> 26:48.898
Race to the White House.

26:50.025 --> 26:51.651
They did what they could.

26:51.819 --> 26:53.653
Basically, they hung a lot of drapes.

26:53.821 --> 26:56.489
Lit the set with C stands and lamps.

26:57.491 --> 26:59.367
Frankly, I think it was
an improvement.

26:59.535 --> 27:02.954
We would like now to demonstrate how
the English language ought to be used

27:03.122 --> 27:05.415
by two craftsmen,
our guest commentators.

27:05.582 --> 27:07.166
On the air in ten...

27:09.169 --> 27:14.132
If you view debate purely as sport,
let's call it blood sport.

27:15.175 --> 27:17.427
Then really, all bets are off.

27:17.594 --> 27:21.180
Nine, eight, seven, six.
Standby now!

27:22.516 --> 27:26.477
You have one objective,
and that's to win in that moment.

27:29.023 --> 27:32.900
When you attack
the position of your opponent,

27:33.068 --> 27:35.862
you have to first attack it
clinically and rationally.

27:37.239 --> 27:39.449
Six, five, four...

27:40.200 --> 27:43.745
But mostly what you have to get at
is what's behind those things.

27:43.912 --> 27:47.165
What is driving the human being
who is in front of you.

27:47.333 --> 27:50.877
...three, two, one.

27:54.590 --> 27:57.300
- Gore Vidal.
- Tonight, the key question

27:57.468 --> 28:00.011
for every patriot is

28:00.179 --> 28:04.474
"Can an aging, Hollywood, juvenile
actor with a right-wing script

28:04.641 --> 28:07.727
defeat Richard Nixon,
a professional politician

28:07.895 --> 28:12.607
who currently represents no
discernible interest except his own?"

28:13.484 --> 28:15.693
As of yesterday morning,
Ronald Regan says,

28:15.861 --> 28:17.570
"The only function of government

28:17.738 --> 28:21.282
is to get out of our way and leave us
alone as much as possible."

28:21.700 --> 28:23.785
Now, on this occasion,
I'm afraid I have to agree

28:23.952 --> 28:26.537
with William Buckley,
the distinguished thinker,

28:26.830 --> 28:27.997
when he says...

28:28.165 --> 28:31.000
My favorite quotation from you.
I have a treasury here.

28:31.168 --> 28:34.295
"Today as never before, the State
has the necessary instrument

28:34.463 --> 28:36.464
of our proximate deliverance."

28:36.632 --> 28:38.925
As usual, in your slightly Latinate
and inaccurate style.

28:39.093 --> 28:41.135
But you do feel,
as most of us do,

28:41.303 --> 28:45.098
that the State must
have some responsibility

28:45.265 --> 28:47.642
for what happens in the country.
And now you have Ronald Regan,

28:47.810 --> 28:49.310
whom you approve of,
who does not want to use

28:49.478 --> 28:51.187
the federal government
to do anything at all.

28:51.355 --> 28:54.732
Mr. Smith, I confess
that anything complicated

28:54.900 --> 28:56.359
confuses Mr. Vidal.

28:56.527 --> 28:58.861
This has been plain
for a very long time.

28:59.029 --> 29:01.906
He has a great difficulty
reconciling

29:02.074 --> 29:05.660
even axiomatic positions
concerning political philosophy,

29:05.828 --> 29:09.330
but we were treated to
Mr. Gore Vidal, the playwright.

29:09.998 --> 29:12.333
Saying that, after all,
Ronald Regan

29:12.501 --> 29:18.131
was nothing more than
an "aging Hollywood juvenile actor."

29:18.298 --> 29:21.008
Now, to begin with,
everybody's aging,

29:21.301 --> 29:24.178
- even Mr. Vidal. That's right.
- Even you are, Bill.

29:24.638 --> 29:26.931
- Perceptibly before our eyes.
- Then he said "Hollywood."

29:27.099 --> 29:29.684
Now, one has either
acted in Hollywood

29:29.852 --> 29:33.563
during the time Mr. Reagan acted,
or one didn't act at all.

29:33.730 --> 29:36.858
Mr. Vidal sends all of his books
to Hollywood,

29:37.025 --> 29:38.609
many of which are rejected,

29:38.777 --> 29:40.570
but some of which
are ground out into--

29:40.737 --> 29:42.405
Bill, I never send any there.

29:42.573 --> 29:45.992
But he called him a juvenile actor
which is presumably

29:46.160 --> 29:49.954
to be distinguished from
an adult actor. Now my point is--

29:50.122 --> 29:53.458
Buckley was
his generation's greatest debater.

29:54.084 --> 29:56.294
He knew very well
how to make an argument.

29:56.462 --> 30:01.007
What he was even better at was
dismantling your argument.

30:01.175 --> 30:04.385
- Now, I think this kind of--
- Now, Bill, I think...

30:05.095 --> 30:08.681
- Bill, if I may say so--
- ...as I think ABC has the right...

30:08.849 --> 30:11.767
Just as I think ABC has
the authority... I'm almost through.

30:11.935 --> 30:13.769
No, you're n... In every sense.

30:13.937 --> 30:15.313
Let Mr. Buckley finish his sentence.

30:15.481 --> 30:17.982
Then, Mr. Vidal,
I assure you time to refute it.

30:18.150 --> 30:23.279
If ABC has the authority to invite
the author of Myra Breckinridge

30:23.447 --> 30:26.532
to come and to comment
on Republican politics,

30:26.700 --> 30:29.577
I think that the people
of California have the right,

30:29.745 --> 30:31.996
when they speak overwhelmingly,
to project somebody

30:32.164 --> 30:35.833
into national politics
even if he did commit the sin

30:36.001 --> 30:41.172
of having acted in movies that
were not written by Mr. Vidal.

30:41.340 --> 30:43.758
If Buckley was the great debater
of his time,

30:43.926 --> 30:46.594
Vidal was the great talker
of his time.

30:46.762 --> 30:48.804
Well, as usual, Mr. Buckley...

30:49.681 --> 30:52.433
with his enormous
and thrilling charm,

30:52.601 --> 30:55.895
manages to get away from the issue
toward the comedy.

30:56.605 --> 31:00.191
He's always to the right, I think,
and almost always in the wrong.

31:00.359 --> 31:03.903
And you certainly must, Bill,
maintain your reputation as being

31:04.071 --> 31:06.614
the Marie Antoinette
of the right wing

31:06.782 --> 31:10.201
and continually imposing your own
rather bloodthirsty neuroses

31:10.369 --> 31:13.037
on a political campaign.

31:13.205 --> 31:16.624
He also rehearsed his ad libs.

31:18.210 --> 31:20.878
All the great bon mot
that he unleashed on the air

31:21.046 --> 31:24.090
he tried out first on the reporters
in the press room.

31:26.343 --> 31:30.179
So calling Buckley the
Marie Antoinette of the right wing

31:30.305 --> 31:32.765
he had done that
with a reporter beforehand.

31:33.100 --> 31:34.809
This is the hobgoblinization

31:34.977 --> 31:37.103
- of the Marxists.
- Gentlemen, you have about

31:37.271 --> 31:41.065
one concluding sentence apiece.
Can you give us one?

31:41.900 --> 31:44.610
Well, I think that it is
something for which

31:44.778 --> 31:46.445
all of us have to be grateful,

31:46.613 --> 31:50.283
that there are left in America people
who believe in the democratic process

31:50.450 --> 31:55.538
sufficiently to know that
occasionally people can penetrate

31:55.706 --> 32:01.252
such myths as have been energetically
projected by Mr. Vidal.

32:02.087 --> 32:06.632
Which would be not only a philosophy
in an economy of stagnation,

32:06.800 --> 32:09.635
but also a spiritual world
of stagnation.

32:09.803 --> 32:12.513
Thank you very much indeed,
gentlemen. While...

32:12.681 --> 32:16.183
So these two guys were
circling each other early on.

32:16.351 --> 32:20.271
Why? Partly because each one
saw in the other

32:20.439 --> 32:25.484
a kind of exaggerated image of his
own anxious version of himself.

32:29.239 --> 32:31.741
It's almost as if they were
matter and anti-matter.

32:31.908 --> 32:34.410
Sort of parallel lives.

32:39.249 --> 32:42.460
They spoke with
these patrician languid accents.

32:42.628 --> 32:44.670
They'd both been to boarding schools.

32:44.838 --> 32:47.632
Very prestigious families
and backgrounds.

32:47.799 --> 32:48.966
So everyone thought.

32:49.551 --> 32:54.180
These were two guys who were not so
much of the Eastern establishment,

32:54.348 --> 32:57.266
as conquerors
of the Eastern establishment.

32:57.851 --> 33:00.603
Gore never went to college,

33:01.104 --> 33:03.773
which he was very proud of actually.

33:03.982 --> 33:05.733
We are savages, my family.

33:05.901 --> 33:07.985
Father was from the frontier.

33:09.404 --> 33:14.033
We didn't belong to Long Island
society, nor did we wish to.

33:15.494 --> 33:18.371
This has always been
an anti-intellectual country.

33:18.997 --> 33:22.917
These days, anybody who spoke
like those two men in public

33:23.085 --> 33:25.086
would be seen to be heartless.

33:25.504 --> 33:29.131
In fact, they're supposed to be what
American mass audience despises.

33:29.299 --> 33:32.343
They're intellectual.
They sound like elites.

33:32.511 --> 33:33.886
But people warmed to it.

33:34.054 --> 33:37.098
Mr. Buckley, do you think miniskirts
are in good taste?

33:37.265 --> 33:39.141
On you I think they are.

33:44.356 --> 33:46.482
- Those legs are in good taste.
- Great legs.

33:46.650 --> 33:48.776
I never would've
figured you for that kind.

33:51.321 --> 33:53.072
Gore Vidal famously said,

33:53.281 --> 33:56.617
sex and appearing on television."

33:56.785 --> 33:58.285
- Go ahead, Gore.
- Joanne Woodward.

33:58.537 --> 34:00.830
Very good.
That's one down and nine to go.

34:02.749 --> 34:04.417
Hey, put on your--

34:04.584 --> 34:08.545
They both instinctually knew
about the power of television

34:08.714 --> 34:11.716
in a way that a lot of American
intellectuals of that era did not.

34:11.882 --> 34:14.677
Why don't you just talk to me instead
of talking to the audience?

34:14.844 --> 34:17.304
Well, by a curious thing,
we have not found ourselves

34:17.472 --> 34:20.433
in a friendly neighborhood bar,
but both by election are sitting here

34:20.600 --> 34:22.518
with an audience.
So therefore it would be

34:22.686 --> 34:25.228
dishonest of us to pretend otherwise.

34:26.606 --> 34:29.483
Mr. Buckley, I've noticed that
whenever you appear on television,

34:29.650 --> 34:31.025
you're always seated.

34:31.235 --> 34:33.612
Does this mean
you can't think on your feet?

34:35.782 --> 34:38.743
It's very... very hard to stand up

34:38.909 --> 34:42.246
carrying the...
the weight of what I know.

34:45.751 --> 34:50.463
They were both very much aware that
TV is the present and the future.

34:50.630 --> 34:53.007
And you have to be on it
and you have to use it well.

35:04.853 --> 35:07.104
In a way, I think
the brilliant thing about Gore Vidal

35:07.272 --> 35:10.649
is he had opinions and he was willing
to air them and very, very bravely.

35:10.817 --> 35:13.152
I mean, this was the person that
wrote The City and the Pillar,

35:13.320 --> 35:15.279
published in 1948.

35:15.697 --> 35:18.741
It was the first novel
that dealt very openly...

35:20.327 --> 35:24.914
with homosexuality as being
a perfectly normal sexual activity.

35:26.541 --> 35:28.417
He was willing to take these risks

35:28.585 --> 35:33.088
that almost no one statistically
was ever willing to take.

35:33.632 --> 35:36.842
He deserved so much credit for that
that he does not get.

35:37.427 --> 35:40.471
You have your own narrow views
of what is correct sexual behavior.

35:40.639 --> 35:41.722
I happen to disagree with it

35:41.890 --> 35:43.516
and I think there are
a great many people who do.

35:43.683 --> 35:48.187
We cannot in any way encourage young
boys into this kind of relationship.

35:48.355 --> 35:50.898
You have every right to propagandize
from the pulpit,

35:51.066 --> 35:54.151
and give us the same right to
propagandize with books.

35:54.319 --> 35:56.529
I certainly am not gonna try
to shut down your church,

35:56.696 --> 35:58.948
as appalling
as I find your argument.

35:59.115 --> 36:01.492
Vidal's view is that sexual
orientation

36:01.660 --> 36:05.955
amongst civilized humans
is not named, discussed, or labeled.

36:07.916 --> 36:11.794
Gore Vidal would never
answer to the question:

36:11.962 --> 36:14.755
Are you gay?
"Yes, I'm gay."

36:16.633 --> 36:19.552
You have to understand
that Gore was obsessed

36:19.761 --> 36:22.304
with shedding sexual labels.

36:23.598 --> 36:25.182
It is as natural
to be homosexual

36:25.350 --> 36:26.600
as it is to be heterosexual.

36:26.768 --> 36:29.436
And the difference between a
homosexual and a heterosexual

36:29.604 --> 36:31.355
is about the difference between
somebody who has brown eyes

36:31.523 --> 36:33.190
- and somebody who has blue eyes.
- Who says so?

36:33.358 --> 36:36.819
I say so. It is a completely natural
act from the beginning of time.

36:37.654 --> 36:41.240
The morays of the country
are going to hell.

36:41.950 --> 36:44.243
And if there was one thing
William Buckley cared more about

36:44.411 --> 36:46.203
than anything,
it would have been that.

36:46.371 --> 36:48.747
We go on like this,
abortion will be on demand.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.418
Women will have sex with women.
The family will be over.

36:52.586 --> 36:54.420
The church won't be respected.

36:54.588 --> 36:57.548
People will be screwing in the
street, frightening the horses.

36:57.716 --> 36:59.508
Buggery will be legal.

37:00.343 --> 37:04.263
And if you'd said all that to Gore,
he'd have said, "Okay, bring it on."

37:07.893 --> 37:11.186
In a very moving piece
called "A Blow for Peace,"

37:11.354 --> 37:13.856
in that magazine I will not mention,

37:14.024 --> 37:16.400
on the 29th of December, 1964--

37:16.610 --> 37:18.986
We know that you'd like nothing
to sully your lips.

37:19.195 --> 37:22.531
You came out...
You will eat it first.

37:23.450 --> 37:28.370
You came out in favor of history
at H for such an act of greatness.

37:28.538 --> 37:31.123
That is the bombing of the Chinese
nuclear capacity.

37:31.291 --> 37:33.417
Mr. Vidal, I have no doubt
that there are...

37:33.585 --> 37:36.128
there is somebody in
Haight-Ashbury or Greenwich Village

37:36.296 --> 37:40.132
who considers that your caricature
is fetching. I don't.

37:40.383 --> 37:43.802
I was invited here and
am prepared to try to talk about

37:43.970 --> 37:45.846
- the Republican Convention.
- Yes.

37:46.014 --> 37:48.140
But I maintain that
it's very difficult to do so

37:48.308 --> 37:52.061
when you have somebody like this
who speaks in such verse

37:52.228 --> 37:54.563
and he likes to be naughty.

37:54.731 --> 37:56.607
Which has proved to be
a professionally

37:56.775 --> 37:58.567
highly merchandisable vice.

37:58.735 --> 38:01.946
Not unlike your so public vices
and wickedness.

38:03.114 --> 38:07.576
We have to keep in mind
the left-wing was never hesitant

38:07.744 --> 38:10.037
about smearing anybody
from the right-wing.

38:10.830 --> 38:13.916
That was a battle
Bill had to fight all the time.

38:14.084 --> 38:17.086
The disease of the right
is greed, bigotry,

38:17.337 --> 38:19.755
insensitivity and general stupidity.

38:19.923 --> 38:22.091
On a radio interview,
you said that you thought

38:22.342 --> 38:25.594
"the Jews tend to construct ongoing
political myth centered around

38:25.762 --> 38:28.389
the Hitlerian experience,
which more or less suggests

38:28.556 --> 38:30.474
that Hitler was the embodiment
of the ultra-right."

38:30.642 --> 38:34.311
True. Most Jews suggest Hitler was
the embodiment of the ultra-right.

38:34.479 --> 38:36.480
He certainly wasn't the embodiment
of the ultra-left.

38:36.648 --> 38:40.275
And do you care to read the context,
or shall I cram it down your throat?

38:40.443 --> 38:41.485
No, no, no.

38:41.653 --> 38:43.445
If you are a right-winger,

38:43.613 --> 38:46.240
you don't want to have
anything to do with

38:46.408 --> 38:50.077
the Gnostic heresies
of Nazism and Fascism.

38:50.829 --> 38:54.665
And that was a label that the
left-wing kept trying to pin

38:54.874 --> 38:56.291
on the right-wing.

38:58.128 --> 39:00.796
Which is the cherry bomb
that is waiting to go off.

39:00.964 --> 39:03.298
And eventually does.

39:06.261 --> 39:07.886
Good evening from Miami Beach.

39:08.054 --> 39:11.724
Again we bring you in 90 minutes
all that's worth seeing and knowing

39:11.891 --> 39:15.269
as the convention's moment of truth
comes near.

39:21.317 --> 39:22.901
- Can you hear me?
- Yes!

39:23.653 --> 39:25.279
I said "rich America!"

39:27.157 --> 39:28.365
Quiet!

39:30.493 --> 39:33.579
Never has obedience to law

39:33.747 --> 39:36.915
been so disdained.

39:37.667 --> 39:40.335
In 1968, you see the beginning

39:40.503 --> 39:42.921
of a Republican kind of rhetoric

39:43.089 --> 39:46.967
in which strategies of dividing
the country racially

39:47.135 --> 39:51.555
are disguised with language
along the lines of law and order.

39:51.848 --> 39:54.308
Let's make America first again,

39:54.476 --> 39:56.810
in respect for order
and justice under law.

39:57.020 --> 39:58.729
Now, isn't that what you want?!

39:58.938 --> 40:00.898
Isn't that where
we're going to go?

40:01.816 --> 40:04.777
You wanted law and order
in this town. You've got it.

40:05.320 --> 40:07.029
He's bluffing, boys. Let's get him.

40:09.532 --> 40:12.159
The next one gets a load of buckshot.
Any takers?

40:14.079 --> 40:17.498
Must we avoid
our great cities by night,

40:17.957 --> 40:23.253
as if they were guerilla-infested
hamlets out in Vietnam?

40:23.421 --> 40:24.630
No!

40:24.798 --> 40:26.548
10-27, we're setting up.

40:26.716 --> 40:30.928
There was a racial
protest that turned into a riot

40:31.096 --> 40:33.055
at the convention in Miami.

40:35.141 --> 40:38.519
These were two visions
of America clashing.

40:38.770 --> 40:40.854
Don't give me any
of that crap. Turn around.

40:41.231 --> 40:44.316
Look at that man back there.
You wanna look? Look at that picture.

40:44.484 --> 40:47.903
To be sure, this might have been
a trick by the lily-white climate

40:48.071 --> 40:51.073
of the Republican Convention
which is in progress right now

40:51.241 --> 40:52.825
just a few miles from here.

40:55.161 --> 41:00.791
The fault lines in our politics
were decided in the 1968 election.

41:01.459 --> 41:04.962
Alliances that connect
in shifting ways.

41:05.588 --> 41:09.591
Racial, religious, socio-economic.

41:09.759 --> 41:13.178
What we now call "identity politics"
was being formed then.

41:13.763 --> 41:17.307
And Buckley knew it, because to
some extent he'd helped create it.

41:21.271 --> 41:23.939
The subject for William
Buckley and Gore Vidal tonight:

41:24.107 --> 41:25.649
"Beyond the Nominations."

41:25.817 --> 41:29.069
What issues can the Republicans use
effectively to win?

41:29.237 --> 41:31.029
Well, I think two primarily.

41:31.197 --> 41:33.866
law and order.

41:34.033 --> 41:36.869
I wish there was a way of saying
"law and order"

41:37.036 --> 41:39.538
that didn't make critics say,

41:39.706 --> 41:41.582
"You're talking about
the racial question."

41:41.833 --> 41:45.878
I would like to know how to say
"law and order" by other means,

41:46.045 --> 41:47.796
but still mean law and order.

41:47.964 --> 41:51.925
And one of the problems that we face,
and that Nixon's gonna face, is this.

41:52.093 --> 41:54.136
What do we do about the growth

41:54.304 --> 41:58.557
of really mutinous members
of the American community?

41:58.725 --> 42:00.559
These people have got to be faced
not only politically,

42:00.727 --> 42:02.060
but philosophically.

42:02.228 --> 42:05.022
And this is something which,
in my judgment, Mr. Nixon

42:05.190 --> 42:10.152
has got to elevate into the status
of the genuine national debate.

42:10.820 --> 42:13.530
I think that if Richard Nixon
were elected President,

42:13.698 --> 42:16.575
it would be an absolute,
no matter with what good will,

42:17.202 --> 42:20.329
it would be a disaster because
the young, the black, the poor

42:20.496 --> 42:24.082
are disaffected and I don't see him
ever drawing them to him.

42:24.709 --> 42:28.086
Vidal understood what
it meant to take the positions that

42:28.254 --> 42:32.716
William F. Buckley, Jr. took towards
civil rights during those years.

42:33.801 --> 42:38.263
This was at a time when political
leaders had been able to block

42:38.431 --> 42:41.308
civil rights legislations
with the support

42:41.476 --> 42:43.977
of entities like
the National Review

42:44.145 --> 42:46.855
and figures like
William F. Buckley Jr.

42:48.149 --> 42:50.817
In the United States,
five percent of the population

42:50.985 --> 42:52.611
have 20 percent of the income.

42:52.779 --> 42:55.739
And the bottom 20 percent
have five percent of the income.

42:55.907 --> 42:58.742
- I think this is irrelevant.
- I know that you revel

42:58.910 --> 43:03.497
in this kind of inequality.
Your business is based upon that.

43:03.665 --> 43:06.750
I believe that freedom
breeds our inequality.

43:06.918 --> 43:08.377
Say that again?

43:08.544 --> 43:11.004
Freedom breeds inequality.

43:11.172 --> 43:13.840
- I'll say it a third time.
- No, twice was enough.

43:14.133 --> 43:16.551
- I think you made your point.
- Unless you have freedom

43:16.719 --> 43:19.680
to be unequal,
there is no such thing as freedom.

43:19.847 --> 43:24.059
And with Buckley, you see
a shrill defense of what he sees

43:24.227 --> 43:27.646
as a completely collapsing
social and cultural order.

43:28.856 --> 43:30.732
- What can I say?
- Not much.

43:30.900 --> 43:34.111
You've given that
ghastly position once again

43:34.654 --> 43:37.698
of the well to-do
and those who inherit money

43:37.865 --> 43:39.616
and believe that others
who do not...

43:39.784 --> 43:44.663
- This is balderdash.
- ...must somehow achieve equality.

43:44.831 --> 43:48.208
But, in actual fact,
you're going to have a revolution,

43:48.376 --> 43:50.544
if you don't give the people
the things they want.

43:50.712 --> 43:52.587
Now, I'm putting it
to your own self-interest,

43:52.755 --> 43:54.589
they're going to come
and take it away from you.

43:56.676 --> 43:58.719
Because Vidal is so educated,

43:58.886 --> 44:01.596
and so one of his class,

44:01.764 --> 44:04.224
for Buckley,
the betrayal of those values

44:04.392 --> 44:06.143
seems to be almost personal.

44:07.395 --> 44:09.646
Buckley, he didn't believe
in democracy.

44:10.398 --> 44:13.942
He believed in rule by elites,
starting with him.

44:24.120 --> 44:26.413
The conservative party
in New York state

44:26.581 --> 44:29.249
had gone to Buckley and said,
"Put your money where your mouth is.

44:29.417 --> 44:31.084
Run for mayor."

44:32.587 --> 44:35.547
So it was Bill Buckley,
the conservative candidate,

44:36.090 --> 44:39.926
and John Lindsay, the darling
of liberal Republicans,

44:40.094 --> 44:42.804
whom Buckley was intent on defeating.

44:43.222 --> 44:45.015
He has said
that you're out to destroy

44:45.224 --> 44:46.725
everything that he stands for.

44:46.893 --> 44:48.685
That is roughly correct.
I couldn't have put it better.

44:48.853 --> 44:50.520
I'm out to destroy
everything that he stands for:

44:50.688 --> 44:52.397
hypocrisy and ultra-leftism.

44:55.193 --> 44:58.111
Conservatism
in America is an insurgency.

45:00.656 --> 45:04.117
It's not the right
fighting the far left,

45:04.285 --> 45:09.164
it's the right fighting people
who are not quite far enough right.

45:10.792 --> 45:15.295
Buckley discovered a new constituency
for the Republican party.

45:15.463 --> 45:18.215
It was angry white ethnics

45:18.383 --> 45:20.384
in Brooklyn, in Queens,

45:20.551 --> 45:22.969
in Staten Island,
in the outer boroughs.

45:23.137 --> 45:26.640
The same people who voted
for Goldwater in '64

45:26.808 --> 45:31.103
at a time of mounting
racial unrest in America.

45:31.854 --> 45:33.855
The conservatives,
more than 1,200 of them,

45:34.023 --> 45:37.526
paid one dollar each
to see William F. Buckley Jr.

45:37.902 --> 45:39.986
There was nothing fancy
on the menu here.

45:40.154 --> 45:41.822
Just hot tongue and cold shoulder

45:41.989 --> 45:44.241
for everything distasteful
to the conservatives.

45:44.409 --> 45:47.661
Ladies and gentlemen, the
apparent winner of this election...

45:48.996 --> 45:51.206
is Mr. John Lindsay.

45:54.877 --> 45:57.921
He was realistic enough in 1965

45:58.089 --> 46:00.048
to realize that he could not win.

46:00.216 --> 46:04.970
What has made a difference is that
thanks to your efforts,

46:05.430 --> 46:09.975
we have begun to reintroduce the
two-party system to New York City.

46:11.352 --> 46:13.437
What Buckley had found
all through his career,

46:13.604 --> 46:15.730
he wrote about this when he was
still a fairly young man,

46:15.898 --> 46:18.859
is he said,
"I lose all the big battles,

46:19.026 --> 46:21.194
but I win all the small,
personal ones."

46:22.655 --> 46:24.364
He said it with kind of frustration.

46:24.782 --> 46:29.077
What he wanted to do
was to win the big war.

46:30.955 --> 46:35.459
The next president of
the United States, Richard Nixon!

46:39.255 --> 46:40.589
Bill Buckley says,

46:40.756 --> 46:44.050
"This election, it'll be decided
on the issue of law and order."

46:45.636 --> 46:47.095
And he was right.

46:50.558 --> 46:54.769
What is on people's minds,
what frightens them

46:54.937 --> 46:58.482
is the fear that a generation that,
by the New Deal,

46:58.649 --> 47:03.653
was put into the middle class is now
going to lose all of those gains.

47:05.615 --> 47:08.366
These are the debates
we're having today.

47:16.167 --> 47:17.959
Thank you very much, gentlemen.

47:18.127 --> 47:20.295
You'll certainly be back,
I'm delighted to know,

47:20.463 --> 47:23.006
for the Democratic Convention,
where Mr. Buckley may attack

47:23.174 --> 47:25.842
and Mr. Vidal will have to defend.

47:26.010 --> 47:28.053
We'll be back after this message.

47:31.224 --> 47:33.141
♪ ♪

47:35.895 --> 47:38.396
ABC was very happy
with the coverage.

47:39.565 --> 47:42.776
When you talk about Buckley-Vidal,
people took notice.

47:42.944 --> 47:44.986
And they got noticed in the press.

47:45.154 --> 47:49.407
That was very important in 1968
to everybody in television.

47:50.743 --> 47:54.538
It turned out that
this was kind of a hit.

47:54.997 --> 47:57.874
"About the only fun to be had
during the GOP convention,

47:58.042 --> 48:00.043
from a television observer's
point of view,

48:00.211 --> 48:02.128
was found
in the nightly tête-à-tête

48:02.296 --> 48:04.089
between William F. Buckley
and Gore Vidal."

48:05.967 --> 48:09.928
I'm never sure whether
politics leads what argument is,

48:10.096 --> 48:12.097
or argument leads what politics is.

48:12.765 --> 48:18.311
But together, Buckley and Vidal
are enormously successful.

48:24.819 --> 48:28.238
I've always tried to keep my
political life and my literary life

48:28.406 --> 48:29.614
somewhat apart.

48:29.782 --> 48:32.867
But in 1959,
I decided to bring the two together

48:33.035 --> 48:35.787
in a play that became a film.

48:37.415 --> 48:40.458
Gore does have a sense
of a deep America and a deep history.

48:41.335 --> 48:43.044
He's written The Best Man.

48:44.797 --> 48:47.549
The best play ever written about
an American political convention.

48:48.092 --> 48:50.969
Do you think people mistrust
intellectuals like you in politics?

48:51.137 --> 48:53.763
Intellectual?
You mean I wrote a book?

48:55.141 --> 48:56.558
Well, as Bertram Russell said,

48:56.726 --> 48:59.269
"People in a democracy tend to think
they have less to fear

48:59.437 --> 49:01.771
from a stupid man
than an intelligent one.

49:01.939 --> 49:04.566
Actually, it's the other way around.
It's the stupid man--"

49:04.734 --> 49:10.155
Vidal's interest in politics
was not only ideological.

49:10.531 --> 49:13.783
It was a very personal
and social thing.

49:13.993 --> 49:16.620
What image do you feel Senator
Campbell is projecting at the moment?

49:16.787 --> 49:18.496
I'm afraid I don't know
anything about images.

49:18.664 --> 49:21.291
That's a term from advertising where
you don't try to sell a product,

49:21.459 --> 49:23.793
you sell the image of the product.
Sometimes, the image is a fake!

49:23.961 --> 49:27.005
- After all, your own image is--
- A poor thing, but mine own.

49:27.173 --> 49:29.341
Paint me as I am, wart and all.

49:29.508 --> 49:31.676
Gore was born
into a political family.

49:31.844 --> 49:34.387
He's the grandson of a senator,
T.P. Gore of Oklahoma.

49:34.555 --> 49:36.348
His father was
in the Roosevelt administration.

49:36.515 --> 49:40.185
He saw himself as the heir
to this political dynasty.

49:40.353 --> 49:42.145
And he was going to be
the greatest of them all.

49:48.569 --> 49:50.445
Candidate Gore Vidal.

49:50.613 --> 49:53.573
Most of my plays,
most of my writing is political

49:53.783 --> 49:56.326
or in criticism of society,
should we say.

49:56.869 --> 49:59.746
Actually, for a change I'm getting
out and trying to do something.

50:01.040 --> 50:04.668
When Gore ran for Congress
from upstate New York in 1960,

50:04.835 --> 50:08.004
he saw it as the first stepping stone
to the Presidency.

50:10.466 --> 50:13.093
He doesn't exactly
have the common touch.

50:13.636 --> 50:16.846
He's not exactly someone
who's going to appeal

50:17.056 --> 50:20.892
to the working class voters
of the United States of America.

50:23.854 --> 50:28.525
He had a sense of himself
as being equal to and belonging

50:28.693 --> 50:32.696
in the world of
the powerful and the elite.

50:34.407 --> 50:37.033
Gore and Jackie Kennedy
were related by marriage.

50:37.201 --> 50:40.995
And Jack Kennedy gave campaign
appearances for him.

50:41.163 --> 50:43.123
He was on the Kennedy ticket.

50:44.917 --> 50:48.253
He was a welcome visitor
at the White House

50:48.421 --> 50:51.881
until there was a run-in
with Bobby Kennedy.

50:53.843 --> 50:56.052
This will sound absurd
with hindsight,

50:56.220 --> 51:00.014
but he probably saw Bobby Kennedy
as competition for the presidency

51:00.182 --> 51:01.850
later in the 60's.

51:02.017 --> 51:04.936
And that's one reason
Gore didn't like Bobby.

51:05.354 --> 51:08.398
Bobby Kennedy is neither liberal,
nor is he much of anything

51:08.566 --> 51:11.693
except a political opportunist
like most of them.

51:12.027 --> 51:14.070
The whole thing has been taken over
by this camera,

51:14.238 --> 51:19.492
by people projecting images,
a ghastly word, and it's...

51:20.244 --> 51:22.078
These are the cards
with which we play.

51:23.873 --> 51:28.001
Bobby Kennedy immediately took
a dislike to Gore Vidal.

51:28.169 --> 51:31.463
Thought he was pompous,
thought he was arrogant.

51:32.548 --> 51:33.798
What is your
current relationship

51:34.008 --> 51:36.760
with Mrs. Onassis, your stepsister?

51:37.178 --> 51:39.429
I haven't seen her since 1962.

51:39.597 --> 51:41.723
There's no reason
for our lines to cross.

51:41.891 --> 51:44.851
She was devoted to Bobby Kennedy,
and I was, as you know, plainly not.

51:45.060 --> 51:47.103
And we fell out over that.

51:52.401 --> 51:54.736
When Gore lost
the race for Congress,

51:55.196 --> 51:58.490
that led to not only a
disillusionment with politics,

51:58.657 --> 52:01.618
but a disillusionment
with the United States.

52:03.954 --> 52:05.455
Naturally,
I wanted to be a politician,

52:05.623 --> 52:07.415
but unfortunately
I was born a writer.

52:07.708 --> 52:13.129
And I would not say that
I've exactly had the life I wanted.

52:15.257 --> 52:17.509
Most of Vidal's work
is done at Ravello

52:17.676 --> 52:19.093
from the Sorrentine coast,

52:19.428 --> 52:22.972
amid lemon groves and vineyards,
2,000 feet above the sea.

52:24.475 --> 52:27.727
His house is improbably perched
above a precipice.

52:27.895 --> 52:31.648
The ideal spot, as he would say,
to observe the decline of the West.

52:34.860 --> 52:37.487
Playboy After Dark,
show number 15.

52:37.655 --> 52:38.905
Take one.

52:48.499 --> 52:52.252
Mr. Vidal, will you please sign
my copy of Myra Breckinridge?

52:52.419 --> 52:55.588
With great pleasure, with my
extra-special William Buckley pen.

52:57.091 --> 52:59.843
I wouldn't be seen without this pen.

53:00.928 --> 53:03.221
- I think this is the property--
- A gift from Bill.

53:03.389 --> 53:06.266
A gift from Bill?
Bill's not as nice as he looks.

53:06.433 --> 53:07.934
I know Bill personally.

53:08.686 --> 53:10.937
- I know both sides of him.
- That's the best way to know him.

53:11.397 --> 53:12.897
Personally.

53:19.947 --> 53:22.407
In the interval
between Miami and Chicago,

53:22.575 --> 53:24.534
I read Myra Breckinridge.

53:25.077 --> 53:27.829
It attempts heuristic allegory,
but fails,

53:27.997 --> 53:30.707
giving gratification only
to sadist homosexuals

53:30.875 --> 53:34.586
and challenge only to
taxonomists of perversion.

53:36.505 --> 53:37.964
I thought and thought about it.

53:38.090 --> 53:40.633
There is nothing left to say
about Myra.

53:45.097 --> 53:46.931
And so we met again,
in Chicago.

53:54.064 --> 53:57.483
Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Chairman...

53:59.361 --> 54:02.530
Good evening from the
International Amphitheater in Chicago.

54:02.698 --> 54:05.116
There are almost as many problems
still to be solved

54:05.284 --> 54:07.076
as there are flies
in this building

54:07.244 --> 54:10.330
located in the heart
of Chicago's stockyards.

54:16.462 --> 54:18.796
The cheery welcome sign
that is everywhere here

54:19.048 --> 54:21.507
is as much a command
as an invitation.

54:22.176 --> 54:24.594
Mayor Daley
has beautified everywhere.

54:24.845 --> 54:30.141
What he cannot beautify,
he's tried to hide behind new fences.

54:30.935 --> 54:33.686
Part of the tightest security checks
an American city

54:33.854 --> 54:36.689
not under riot conditions
has ever experienced.

54:37.024 --> 54:40.276
We want Eugene!
We want Eugene!

54:41.111 --> 54:45.156
Eugene McCarthy and Hubert
Humphrey arrived in Chicago today.

54:45.658 --> 54:48.660
The Democratic party
was in terrific disarray.

54:49.161 --> 54:53.831
Bobby Kennedy had just been killed
a couple of months earlier.

54:53.999 --> 54:56.584
He was already becoming a martyr.

54:59.088 --> 55:01.923
The fight over the Democratic
platform will move here,

55:02.091 --> 55:03.841
right onto the floor
of this convention

55:04.426 --> 55:06.469
demanding a repudiation
and a reversal

55:06.637 --> 55:09.597
of the Johnson administration
policies on Vietnam.

55:11.558 --> 55:14.811
At this moment, it is
the calm in the eye of the storm.

55:18.440 --> 55:21.567
Their wounds have had time to heal
since Miami Beach.

55:21.735 --> 55:24.821
They've had time to restock their
arsenal for new assaults.

55:24.989 --> 55:27.907
"They," of course,
are William Buckley and Gore Vidal.

55:29.243 --> 55:32.036
Mr. Vidal, do you feel more
comfortable, philosophically, here

55:32.204 --> 55:33.705
than you did in Miami?

55:34.206 --> 55:37.875
Philosophically. I wonder if that
word will ever be used again

55:38.252 --> 55:39.460
while we're here in Chicago.

55:40.254 --> 55:43.381
This place is a shambles.
It's a police state.

55:44.258 --> 55:46.592
One's aware of the horrors
of the world here:

55:46.760 --> 55:48.177
the smell of old blood,

55:48.345 --> 55:51.264
the shrieking of the pigs as
they're slaughtered in the morning,

55:51.432 --> 55:54.767
all this reminds one of...
of life and death.

55:55.227 --> 55:57.729
So, in a sense,
I do feel at home in a way,

55:57.896 --> 55:59.647
but not happy.

56:00.607 --> 56:04.193
Buckley realized
he had his intellectual equal

56:04.361 --> 56:05.862
sitting right next to him.

56:06.739 --> 56:08.781
Vidal had done
the homework in Miami.

56:09.241 --> 56:11.075
By the time we got to Chicago,

56:11.368 --> 56:14.162
Buckley had caught up
and done some homework as well.

56:14.747 --> 56:17.165
William Buckley,
while on the defensive in Miami,

56:17.332 --> 56:18.708
may now take the offensive.

56:18.876 --> 56:21.419
He was also
an extremely aggressive debater.

56:21.754 --> 56:26.257
And so he thought that justified
every technique he could use to win.

56:27.176 --> 56:31.012
As a matter of
testamentary integrity,

56:31.180 --> 56:34.766
I reveal a concrete proposal
contained in a letter

56:34.933 --> 56:38.644
sent to me by Senator Kennedy
about six months ago.

56:39.104 --> 56:41.355
The P.S. of which was:

56:41.940 --> 56:45.443
"I have changed
my platform from 1968

56:45.611 --> 56:47.695
from 'let's give blood
to the Viet Kong'

56:47.863 --> 56:50.573
to 'let's give Gore Vidal
to the Viet Kong."'

56:50.741 --> 56:52.366
May I see that? Really?

56:52.534 --> 56:55.078
I think, however,
that would be immoderate.

56:55.329 --> 56:58.915
In any case,
I do share Mr. Kennedy--

56:59.083 --> 57:03.294
- I must say.
- Mr. Kennedy's notion that Mr. Vidal

57:03.587 --> 57:06.380
is marred by his sort of
strange fantasies

57:06.548 --> 57:09.133
concerning the realisms of politics.

57:10.344 --> 57:13.763
We all recognize that moment
when we reach for a weapon

57:13.931 --> 57:16.599
that we know is sort of off-bounds.

57:16.767 --> 57:19.185
- This is Senator Bobby Kennedy.
- Yes, I realized.

57:19.353 --> 57:22.313
What a very curious handwriting.
It also slants up.

57:22.481 --> 57:24.023
Sign of a manic depressive.

57:24.399 --> 57:26.109
You still mad about Senator Kennedy?

57:26.652 --> 57:28.736
I did say that.
Whether you forged it or not,

57:28.904 --> 57:31.489
I don't know and I will have to have
my handwriting experts,

57:31.657 --> 57:34.492
the graphologists will have to look
at it. I put nothing beyond you.

57:35.119 --> 57:38.121
But to get back to the plank
while we...

57:38.288 --> 57:41.499
It's been fun inspecting your
correspondence, but...

57:41.667 --> 57:44.627
Vidal is relatively unfazed.

57:44.795 --> 57:46.963
He had almost a Zen technique.

57:47.881 --> 57:50.424
You let the guy lean forward
so that he falls over.

57:51.260 --> 57:54.679

And I think, to be perfectly bleak,
and to be perfectly blunt,

01:00:26.206 --> 01:00:29.000
I think we're headed
for total disaster, this empire,

01:00:29.167 --> 01:00:32.253
with people like Mr. Buckley here
beating the drum.

01:00:32.421 --> 01:00:35.423

I see little American flags

on the antenna of the car.

01:00:39.344 --> 01:00:40.511
They're getting ready
for a war.

01:00:40.637 --> 01:00:41.637
They're getting ready for war.

01:00:47.311 --> 01:00:50.062
What Vidal saw
was that the American empire

01:00:50.230 --> 01:00:52.982
was completely overextended.

01:00:55.819 --> 01:00:59.530
These empires are
very dangerous things to possess,

01:00:59.698 --> 01:01:01.532
as Pericles once pointed out.

01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:04.785
And once you get one,
it's very difficult to let it go.

01:01:04.953 --> 01:01:07.580
But if we don't let it go,
it's going to wreck us economically.

01:01:07.748 --> 01:01:08.372
We're already in trouble.

01:01:08.373 --> 01:01:09.081
We're already in trouble.

01:01:09.249 --> 01:01:11.500
And it has certainly divided
the country at a time

01:01:11.668 --> 01:01:14.795
when resources should go
to the slums and to the poor

01:01:14.963 --> 01:01:18.507
and to trying to revise
an extremely shabby country.

01:01:18.884 --> 01:01:22.345
I tell you, the day Rome falls
there will be a shout of freedom

01:01:22.512 --> 01:01:24.680
such as the world
has never heard before!

01:01:25.390 --> 01:01:27.558
Gore Vidal disliked
the United States of America.

01:01:27.809 --> 01:01:32.146
He always talked about the empire
in which he is now right.

01:01:32.606 --> 01:01:34.398
Gore Vidal was correct
in prophesizing

01:01:34.566 --> 01:01:36.025
that we would become an empire.

01:01:37.110 --> 01:01:38.986
That is our present dilemma.

01:01:50.999 --> 01:01:56.921
The whole world is watching!
The whole world is watching!

01:01:57.130 --> 01:01:59.673
This is the year
of "the whole world is watching."

01:01:59.841 --> 01:02:02.676
This is the year where all politics
is suddenly televisual.

01:02:02.844 --> 01:02:06.555
This is the year where the phrase
"living room war" comes.

01:02:07.682 --> 01:02:10.643
It was as if a theater
piece was taking place

01:02:10.811 --> 01:02:14.355
for the public watching television.

01:02:23.532 --> 01:02:26.158
Please, help me!

01:02:27.702 --> 01:02:31.497
If you do not leave,
you will be subject to arrest!

01:02:57.232 --> 01:03:01.360
Gore asked me to drive him
to an event with a couple of friends.

01:03:01.528 --> 01:03:06.615
So I had Gore Vidal, Arthur Miller
and Paul Newman in my car.

01:03:07.617 --> 01:03:10.077
And we drove
into a cloud of tear gas.

01:03:26.094 --> 01:03:27.887
Get away from the police.
Step up here.

01:03:28.096 --> 01:03:31.056
Put the flare down.
They're pushing and shoving.

01:03:31.516 --> 01:03:33.809
- We're gonna get it.
- Stop!

01:03:36.062 --> 01:03:39.190
The whole world is watching!
The whole world is watching!

01:03:42.235 --> 01:03:43.777
Who is first?
Mr. Vidal first.

01:03:45.614 --> 01:03:48.991
Uh, it's like living
under a Soviet regime here.

01:03:49.201 --> 01:03:53.537
The guards, the soldiers,
the agents provocateur,

01:03:53.705 --> 01:03:56.499
and the parts of the police,
you've seen the roughing up.

01:03:56.958 --> 01:04:00.419
There's very little that we can say
after those pictures...

01:04:01.463 --> 01:04:03.130
that would be in any way adequate.

01:04:03.298 --> 01:04:04.965
Let Mr. Buckley comment now.

01:04:05.133 --> 01:04:08.344
The effort here,
not only on your program tonight,

01:04:08.512 --> 01:04:11.388
but during the past two
or three days in Chicago

01:04:11.556 --> 01:04:14.808
has been to institutionalize
this complaint.

01:04:15.310 --> 01:04:19.855
So as to march forward and say we've
got sort of a Fascist situation,

01:04:20.690 --> 01:04:24.985
but don't infer from individual
and despicable acts of violence

01:04:25.153 --> 01:04:29.490
of Chicago policemen,
a case for implicit totalitarianism

01:04:29.658 --> 01:04:31.116
in the American system.

01:04:31.284 --> 01:04:33.410
If we can all work up an equal sweat,

01:04:33.578 --> 01:04:36.705
and if you all would be obliging
enough to have your cameras handy,

01:04:36.957 --> 01:04:39.333
every time a politician
commits demagogy,

01:04:39.501 --> 01:04:44.046
or every time a labor union beats up
people who refuse to join his union,

01:04:44.214 --> 01:04:47.550
then maybe we can work up some kind
of impartiality and resentment.

01:04:47.759 --> 01:04:50.094
These people came here
with no desire other

01:04:50.262 --> 01:04:51.595
than anybody's been able to prove,

01:04:51.763 --> 01:04:54.056
- than hold peaceful demonstration.
- I can prove it.

01:04:54.224 --> 01:04:57.685
I was 14 windows
above that gang last night.

01:04:57.852 --> 01:05:01.605
And the chant between 11:00
and 5:00 this morning

01:05:01.856 --> 01:05:03.482
from four or 5,000 voices

01:05:03.650 --> 01:05:06.068
was sheer utter obscenities

01:05:06.236 --> 01:05:08.445
directed to the president
of the United States.

01:05:08.613 --> 01:05:12.866
I think it is remarkable that there
was as much restraint shown

01:05:13.034 --> 01:05:16.537
as was shown, for instance, last
night by cops who were out there

01:05:16.705 --> 01:05:21.792
for 17 hours without inflicting a
single wound on a single person,

01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:24.920
even though that kind of disgusting
stuff is being thrown at them

01:05:25.088 --> 01:05:26.880
and at all of American society.

01:05:27.048 --> 01:05:30.426
Mr. Vidal, wasn't it a provocative
act to try to raise

01:05:30.594 --> 01:05:34.597
the Viet Kong flag in the park
in the film we just saw?

01:05:34.764 --> 01:05:37.933
Wouldn't that invite...
Raising a Nazi flag in WWII

01:05:38.101 --> 01:05:39.685
would've had similar consequences.

01:05:39.853 --> 01:05:41.854
- Yes, and--
- People in the United States

01:05:42.022 --> 01:05:46.066
happen to believe that the United
States' policy is wrong in Vietnam

01:05:46.234 --> 01:05:49.320
and that Viet Kong are correct in
wanting to organize their country

01:05:49.487 --> 01:05:51.155
in their own way politically.

01:05:51.323 --> 01:05:54.074
If it is a novelty in Chicago
that is too bad,

01:05:54.242 --> 01:05:56.368
but I assume that the point
of the American democracy

01:05:56.536 --> 01:05:58.996
is you can express
any point of view that you want.

01:05:59.164 --> 01:06:00.956
- Shut up a minute.
- No, I won't.

01:06:01.124 --> 01:06:04.501
Some people were pro-Nazi and the
answer is that they were well treated

01:06:04.711 --> 01:06:08.088
by people who ostracized them.
And I'm for ostracizing people

01:06:08.256 --> 01:06:11.050
who egg on other people to shoot
American Marines

01:06:11.217 --> 01:06:13.218
and American soldiers.
I know you don't care--

01:06:13.386 --> 01:06:15.596
As far as I'm concerned,
the only sort of pro

01:06:15.764 --> 01:06:18.098
or crypto-Nazi I can think of
is yourself.

01:06:18.266 --> 01:06:21.268
- Failing that, I will only say--
- Let's not call names.

01:06:21.436 --> 01:06:24.104
Now listen, you queer,
stop calling me a crypto-Nazi

01:06:24.356 --> 01:06:28.192
or I'll sock you in the goddamn
face and you'll stay plastered.

01:06:28.401 --> 01:06:29.777
- Gentlemen, let's--
- Bill.

01:06:29.944 --> 01:06:32.988
Tell the author of Myra Breckinridge
to go back to his pornography

01:06:33.156 --> 01:06:34.907
and stop making
any allusions of Nazism.

01:06:35.075 --> 01:06:37.117
I was in the Infantry
in the last war.

01:06:37.285 --> 01:06:40.371
You were not in the Infantry.
As a matter of fact, you were not.

01:06:40.538 --> 01:06:42.706
You're distorting
your own military record.

01:06:51.216 --> 01:06:53.133
The network nearly shat.

01:06:53.635 --> 01:06:56.595
Now listen, you queer,
stop calling me a crypto-Nazi.

01:06:56.763 --> 01:07:00.724
Or I'll sock you in the goddamn face
and you'll stay plastered.

01:07:00.892 --> 01:07:02.476
- Gentlemen--
- I was watching it

01:07:02.644 --> 01:07:05.771
with a number of the news executives
in the control room.

01:07:06.272 --> 01:07:08.357
Someone said,
"Can they say that?!"

01:07:08.733 --> 01:07:11.151
Well, you know, it's live.
They had.

01:07:12.362 --> 01:07:14.655
I think Gore Vidal was fortunate

01:07:14.823 --> 01:07:17.074
that Bill didn't
punch him in the nose.

01:07:17.492 --> 01:07:20.160
Bill could've broken Gore Vidal
over the back of his knee.

01:07:21.246 --> 01:07:23.372
When Gore Vidal called him
a crypto-Nazi,

01:07:23.873 --> 01:07:25.416
Bill let him have it.

01:07:25.917 --> 01:07:27.376
It is a slur.

01:07:27.544 --> 01:07:31.088
And the rictus of loathing
on Mr. Buckley's face

01:07:31.256 --> 01:07:32.631
is quite understated.

01:07:32.966 --> 01:07:36.051
Buckley called Vidal
"queer" on television.

01:07:37.053 --> 01:07:39.763
It's a slur. It would be
considered a hate slur today.

01:07:42.684 --> 01:07:49.148
Profanity today is "nigger,"
"faggot" and "cunt."

01:07:49.441 --> 01:07:52.693
Those are our only three
truly profane words.

01:07:53.903 --> 01:07:57.531
In 1968, you could
call somebody a crypto-Nazi

01:07:57.699 --> 01:08:01.118
or a queer,
and that was fighting words.

01:08:01.870 --> 01:08:05.330
You have every right in this country
to take any position you want to take

01:08:05.498 --> 01:08:07.374
because we are guaranteed
freedom of speech.

01:08:07.542 --> 01:08:10.419
We just listened to a rather
grotesque example of it.

01:08:10.587 --> 01:08:12.713
I think we've run out of time

01:08:12.881 --> 01:08:16.675
and I thank you very much
for the discussion.

01:08:16.843 --> 01:08:19.720
It was a little more heat
and a little less light than usual,

01:08:19.888 --> 01:08:21.889
but it was still very worth hearing.

01:08:23.308 --> 01:08:25.058
Tomorrow night, you'll have
a chance to...

01:08:25.435 --> 01:08:27.770
My pulse was racing
and my fingers trembled

01:08:27.937 --> 01:08:30.981
as wave after wave
of indignation swept over me.

01:08:32.024 --> 01:08:33.524
And then, suddenly,

01:08:33.693 --> 01:08:35.819
about to deposit the earphones
on the table stand,

01:08:36.112 --> 01:08:38.279
I stopped, frozen.

01:08:38.698 --> 01:08:42.033
Vidal, arranging his own set
was whispering to me.

01:08:42.827 --> 01:08:44.953
"Well," he said, smiling,

01:08:45.412 --> 01:08:48.122
"I guess we gave them
their money's worth tonight."

01:08:50.042 --> 01:08:54.171
It was a splendid moment.
Eyes rolling, mouth twitching,

01:08:54.339 --> 01:08:56.506
long, weak arms waving.

01:08:57.216 --> 01:09:00.844
Buckley skittered from slander
to glorious absurdity.

01:09:03.723 --> 01:09:06.850
I reached my trailer
after taking great strides

01:09:07.018 --> 01:09:09.645
through the maze of technicians,
operators, executives,

01:09:09.813 --> 01:09:11.604
reporters, guests.

01:09:11.939 --> 01:09:16.276
All of whom looked at me as I stomped
by, and then quickly looked away.

01:09:17.487 --> 01:09:21.406
Afraid, perhaps, that I would greet
anyone guilty of a lingering glance

01:09:21.573 --> 01:09:23.533
with a sock on his goddamn face.

01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:27.912
The door slammed
and I heard shouting.

01:09:28.081 --> 01:09:31.457
Paul Newman had been
in Vidal's trailer,

01:09:31.792 --> 01:09:34.169
and had been watching it on
television, ran down the stairs,

01:09:34.337 --> 01:09:38.423
ran into Buckley's trailer and
Buckley came in at the same time.

01:09:38.675 --> 01:09:43.470
And Buckley, according to Newman,
responded that it was a disaster.

01:09:49.769 --> 01:09:53.354
These ad hominem attacks
were not characteristic of Bill.

01:09:54.649 --> 01:09:58.569
This was a totally unprecedented
thing for him to do on television.

01:10:00.071 --> 01:10:02.739
Vidal was a smart enough
tactician to know

01:10:02.907 --> 01:10:05.701
that he had won the debate
in that moment.

01:10:11.833 --> 01:10:16.295
And that brings up the one final
question now the election is over.

01:10:16.796 --> 01:10:20.924
Will Bill Buckley and Gore Vidal
kiss and make up?

01:10:24.262 --> 01:10:26.471
I think Vidal would love that.

01:10:50.413 --> 01:10:54.207
After we did it, no network
ever again did wall-to-wall,

01:10:54.459 --> 01:10:55.751
gavel-to-gavel coverage.

01:10:57.545 --> 01:10:59.504
It could be that some
executive said, "Hey,

01:10:59.714 --> 01:11:03.550
whatever you may think of it, that
Vidal Buckley thing had a big impact.

01:11:04.844 --> 01:11:07.054
Get Mr. Pro and Mr. Con,

01:11:07.263 --> 01:11:10.265
Ms. For Abortion
and Ms. Against Abortion...

01:11:10.350 --> 01:11:13.977
Jack, I spent the holidays flying
back and forth across this country

01:11:14.145 --> 01:11:15.312
and I'm worried.

01:11:15.647 --> 01:11:18.857
The place seems all out of focus,
sea to shining sea.

01:11:19.609 --> 01:11:22.235
We've both flown many times, Shana,
coast to coast.

01:11:22.403 --> 01:11:23.737
But we see a different land below.

01:11:23.905 --> 01:11:26.615
And you have them argue
and that's punditry.

01:11:26.991 --> 01:11:28.408
That's enlightenment.

01:11:28.534 --> 01:11:31.203
Dan, there's an old saying:
"Behind every successful man

01:11:31.412 --> 01:11:34.206
there's a woman,
a loving, giving, caring woman."

01:11:36.501 --> 01:11:37.918
Jane, you ignorant slut.

01:11:42.048 --> 01:11:44.841
Argument is sugar
and the rest of us are flies.

01:11:48.012 --> 01:11:49.429
Welcome to Radio 81.

01:11:49.722 --> 01:11:51.848
I think this is Ron
and Gore Vidal is also here.

01:11:52.016 --> 01:11:54.559
I invariably agree
with your social views,

01:11:54.936 --> 01:11:56.436
the content of your ideas.

01:11:56.854 --> 01:11:59.231
And I contest with Buckley's views.

01:11:59.691 --> 01:12:03.068
But I hear you talk,
and William Buckley talk,

01:12:03.361 --> 01:12:06.488
I feel that Buckley
is the more honest man.

01:12:07.031 --> 01:12:09.533
In what way do you find him
more honest than I?

01:12:09.701 --> 01:12:12.911
I think it goes way back
to the debates

01:12:13.079 --> 01:12:15.038
you had with him on television.

01:12:15.331 --> 01:12:17.958
And you literally blew his mind.

01:12:18.126 --> 01:12:20.168
I've never seen Buckley
lose it like that.

01:12:20.336 --> 01:12:22.337
He swore at you
and stood up and said,

01:12:22.505 --> 01:12:24.381
"How dare you call me a neo-Nazi!"

01:12:24.549 --> 01:12:26.967
I thought him the scum of the world,
you see.

01:12:27.135 --> 01:12:28.760
- I know, he was over-excited, yeah?
- Yes.

01:12:28.928 --> 01:12:30.721
- But I think--
- What did you find dishonest

01:12:30.888 --> 01:12:32.472
about my performance?

01:12:32.682 --> 01:12:35.517
It had to do with
the glee in your face,

01:12:35.685 --> 01:12:37.477
in your eyes,
that you could not hide.

01:12:37.645 --> 01:12:40.188
Well, that isn't...
I wasn't being dishonest.

01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:42.607
I am a happy warrior.

01:12:42.775 --> 01:12:44.443
I'm in battle, I'm enjoying it.

01:12:44.610 --> 01:12:46.653
This is what these things are about.

01:12:46.821 --> 01:12:49.031
If somebody that I regard
is a very bad person...

01:12:49.949 --> 01:12:53.785
politically, then to expose him
on television for what he is

01:12:53.953 --> 01:12:55.537
is my job.

01:12:55.913 --> 01:12:58.540
And I think I accomplished it
very nicely, so did he.

01:12:58.750 --> 01:13:00.959
He brought suit against me
as a result of it.

01:13:02.837 --> 01:13:06.256
A year after these debates,
in August of 1969,

01:13:06.716 --> 01:13:09.801
Esquire published a long essay
that Bill had written,

01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:12.429
something like 12,000 words

01:13:13.097 --> 01:13:17.059
trying to explore why he had
reacted the way he did.

01:13:18.770 --> 01:13:20.896
Buckley couldn't let it go.

01:13:21.064 --> 01:13:22.981
He couldn't let this thing go.

01:13:24.942 --> 01:13:28.111
He thought he would avenge himself
or explain himself

01:13:28.279 --> 01:13:32.240
by writing in a sophisticated way
about Vidal in Esquire.

01:13:35.453 --> 01:13:37.996
For days and weeks,
indeed for months,

01:13:38.164 --> 01:13:40.874
I tormented myself
with the question...

01:13:41.751 --> 01:13:43.835
"What should I have said?"

01:13:44.629 --> 01:13:46.671
Was my mistake that of
going on TV at all,

01:13:46.839 --> 01:13:48.882
in light of the abundant warnings,
with Vidal?

01:13:50.426 --> 01:13:53.220
Could it be that my emotional
reaction was defensible

01:13:53.387 --> 01:13:54.888
and even healthy,

01:13:55.056 --> 01:13:57.808
but that my words were ill-chosen?

01:13:58.184 --> 01:14:01.561
The problem was, instead of
putting a cap on the debate,

01:14:01.729 --> 01:14:04.439
he's perpetuating it
on another platform,

01:14:04.649 --> 01:14:05.982
which really made it worse.

01:14:10.154 --> 01:14:12.364
Vidal then replied

01:14:12.573 --> 01:14:18.078
in print to this barn burner piece
to take the stage back.

01:14:21.624 --> 01:14:24.501
On Wednesday,
August 28, at 9:30,

01:14:24.794 --> 01:14:27.504
in full view of ten million people,

01:14:27.922 --> 01:14:31.633
the little door in William F. Buckley
Jr.'s forehead suddenly opened

01:14:31.926 --> 01:14:35.971
and out sprang that wild cuckoo
which I had always known was there,

01:14:36.139 --> 01:14:39.808
but had wanted so much for others,
preferably millions of others,

01:14:39.976 --> 01:14:41.643
to get a good look at.

01:14:42.937 --> 01:14:46.398
Vidal is always suspicious
of Buckley's sexuality.

01:14:47.233 --> 01:14:51.153
And makes references
that suggest that

01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:54.698
Buckley has an attraction
to the homoerotic.

01:14:56.284 --> 01:14:58.451
There was always a question of...

01:14:59.078 --> 01:15:00.120
Um...

01:15:02.707 --> 01:15:04.082
I don't know how to put it.

01:15:05.459 --> 01:15:09.045
That there was a kind of
sexual ambiguity about Bill.

01:15:10.381 --> 01:15:12.340
There were rumors,
none of them substantiated.

01:15:12.508 --> 01:15:14.801
It was more a manner of affect,
really.

01:15:15.803 --> 01:15:18.138
Buckley was kind of an effete guy.

01:15:18.723 --> 01:15:22.267
If you read the piece,
you are led to believe

01:15:22.435 --> 01:15:27.564
that among other things, William F.
Buckley, Jr. was homosexual.

01:15:31.861 --> 01:15:35.405
Buckley instituted a suit
against Esquire magazine

01:15:35.573 --> 01:15:37.157
and against Vidal.

01:15:37.909 --> 01:15:41.703
Vidal instituted a countersuit
against Buckley.

01:15:42.205 --> 01:15:46.625
The litigation
went on for three years.

01:15:46.792 --> 01:15:48.877
Is that still going back
and forth in the courts?

01:15:49.337 --> 01:15:51.546
It's going more back than forth.

01:15:51.714 --> 01:15:54.549
Just... it keeps on ticking away
like a bomb.

01:15:55.343 --> 01:15:57.719
At the time, it was
one of the longest lawsuits

01:15:57.887 --> 01:16:00.889
between two American public
intellectuals there'd ever been.

01:16:01.057 --> 01:16:02.265
Neither of them ever tired of it.

01:16:02.433 --> 01:16:05.810
It gave them enormous opportunity
for the practice of malice.

01:16:06.395 --> 01:16:08.605
It's still litigious, is it?

01:16:08.773 --> 01:16:10.148
Very litigious.

01:16:12.068 --> 01:16:16.404
By the third year, Esquire
said, "We've had enough."

01:16:18.282 --> 01:16:20.033
Esquire ended up settling.

01:16:20.201 --> 01:16:23.036
And then Buckley,
in a stroke of brilliance,

01:16:23.204 --> 01:16:25.622
gives a press conference
and declares victory.

01:16:26.207 --> 01:16:29.376
In the public imagination,
people thought that he had won

01:16:29.543 --> 01:16:32.420
this lawsuit they didn't
understand in the first place.

01:16:32.713 --> 01:16:34.381
I know that Gore hated that.

01:16:34.548 --> 01:16:37.676
Was it ever resolved, who came out
ahead on that whole thing?

01:16:38.052 --> 01:16:40.679
Well, it sort of went on
for several years.

01:16:40.846 --> 01:16:42.681
And then about a week
before we'd go into court,

01:16:42.848 --> 01:16:44.349
he called off the suit.

01:16:44.517 --> 01:16:46.768
- Pulled the suit out from under you?
- Exactly.

01:16:46.936 --> 01:16:49.980
Exactly.
I was looking forward to that.

01:16:59.657 --> 01:17:03.660
Why do you work so hard?
Why do you work so darn hard?

01:17:04.078 --> 01:17:05.704
There's a lot to do.

01:17:06.372 --> 01:17:09.291
Bill Buckley,
the popularizer, laid the foundation

01:17:09.959 --> 01:17:11.543
for the conservative movement.

01:17:11.711 --> 01:17:13.920
Which enabled Ronald Reagan
to come along

01:17:14.088 --> 01:17:17.549
and to win that presidency
by the margin that he did.

01:17:19.302 --> 01:17:22.178
I can't tell you exactly when
I discovered National Review.

01:17:22.888 --> 01:17:25.056
It had a profound impact on me.

01:17:28.602 --> 01:17:31.438
Well, my relationship
to Ronald Reagan was pretty close.

01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:35.483
There was an affinity of ideas.

01:17:37.903 --> 01:17:40.155
I visited him and he visited me.

01:17:40.323 --> 01:17:42.824
We took a liking to each other.

01:17:42.992 --> 01:17:44.409
Certainly I to him.

01:17:46.078 --> 01:17:48.621
When Ronald Reagan
saluted William Buckley

01:17:48.789 --> 01:17:50.874
and the National Review
as president,

01:17:51.167 --> 01:17:52.542
Buckley became a king maker.

01:17:52.710 --> 01:17:54.252
And he was seen to be a king maker.

01:17:54.420 --> 01:17:58.590
And appearance is at least as
important as reality in this world.

01:17:59.884 --> 01:18:02.052
When Buckley
and Reagan were ascended,

01:18:02.219 --> 01:18:06.848
and Vidal's political ideology
was taking a backseat,

01:18:07.016 --> 01:18:09.267
I think this was actually
a great period for him.

01:18:09.477 --> 01:18:12.062
Some of his greatest writing
occurred in the '80s,

01:18:12.229 --> 01:18:14.147
both in essays and in literature.

01:18:15.149 --> 01:18:16.858
When another right-wing critic

01:18:17.026 --> 01:18:19.569
attacked Gore Vidal
as being anti-American,

01:18:20.696 --> 01:18:22.781
Gore's reply was,
"How can you call me anti-American?

01:18:22.948 --> 01:18:24.741
I'm the country's official
biographer."

01:18:32.124 --> 01:18:34.793
In Burr,
Vidal got off one of his great lines.

01:18:35.378 --> 01:18:39.631
It was the beginning of Vidal's
attempt at revenge on Buckley.

01:18:40.299 --> 01:18:44.386
I believe his name was
"William de la Touche Clancey".

01:18:45.137 --> 01:18:46.805
And I think Vidal said somewhere

01:18:46.972 --> 01:18:49.682
that it could not possibly
be based on anyone,

01:18:49.934 --> 01:18:53.103
meaning that of course
it's based on Bill.

01:18:54.146 --> 01:18:56.481
William de la Touche
Clancey's voice

01:18:56.649 --> 01:18:58.983
is like that of a furious goose,

01:18:59.151 --> 01:19:00.819
all honks and hisses.

01:19:01.862 --> 01:19:03.822
He detests our democracy.

01:19:03.989 --> 01:19:06.533
He fills the pages of his magazine,
America,

01:19:06.700 --> 01:19:09.619
with libelous comments
on all things American.

01:19:09.787 --> 01:19:12.622
Despite a rich wife
and five children,

01:19:12.790 --> 01:19:14.791
he is a compulsive sodomite,

01:19:14.959 --> 01:19:17.961
forever preying on country boys
new to the city.

01:19:19.505 --> 01:19:21.047
It is extreme and...

01:19:22.466 --> 01:19:24.759
He was a good hater, Vidal.

01:19:27.430 --> 01:19:31.224
God knows what is at the very bottom
of that animosity.

01:19:33.352 --> 01:19:35.186
He talked about it every day.

01:19:35.813 --> 01:19:39.482
You don't talk about something
every day that didn't cut you.

01:19:39.900 --> 01:19:42.193
And I don't think
that ever really healed.

01:19:44.947 --> 01:19:48.658
We were in Ravello,
not much to do after dinner.

01:19:49.243 --> 01:19:53.663
He had acquired a VHS copy
of the Vidal/Buckley debates.

01:19:53.831 --> 01:19:56.708
I naively said,
"Do you think we could watch them?"

01:19:56.876 --> 01:20:00.420
Little did I realize this was
the main event for the night.

01:20:02.214 --> 01:20:04.841
We then watched them, I think,
again a couple nights later.

01:20:05.009 --> 01:20:09.220
And on subsequent trips we watched
them two or three times.

01:20:09.388 --> 01:20:12.015
And the thrill
of the first viewing was gone.

01:20:12.183 --> 01:20:13.975
And you began to have the sensation

01:20:14.143 --> 01:20:16.227
that you were edging
into Sunset Boulevard,

01:20:16.395 --> 01:20:18.354
Norma Desmond territory.

01:20:19.982 --> 01:20:22.108
It was Buckley
who was distressed by it.

01:20:24.069 --> 01:20:28.781
Buckley let it become personal
in a way that he had been a maestro

01:20:28.949 --> 01:20:30.200
of being able to avoid.

01:20:30.367 --> 01:20:32.952
And that haunted him
for a very long time.

01:20:36.123 --> 01:20:38.791
After 33 years on PBS,

01:20:38.959 --> 01:20:43.254
William F. Buckley, Jr. taped his
last program before an audience

01:20:43.422 --> 01:20:44.631
of invited guests.

01:20:45.174 --> 01:20:47.675
The last show was succeeded

01:20:47.843 --> 01:20:49.969
by an interview with Ted Koppel.

01:20:50.137 --> 01:20:52.764
And at one point,
he showed

01:20:52.932 --> 01:20:56.351
the now already infamous clip.

01:20:56.519 --> 01:20:59.562
Now listen, you queer,
stop calling me a crypto-Nazi,

01:20:59.855 --> 01:21:03.900
or I'll sock you in the goddamn face
and you'll stay plastered.

01:21:05.528 --> 01:21:08.863
Buckley, uncharacteristically,
said nothing

01:21:09.031 --> 01:21:11.282
and then they went
to the commercial break.

01:21:11.951 --> 01:21:13.660
I was in the audience that day.

01:21:14.078 --> 01:21:19.624
And he made a beeline up the aisle
to where I was sitting and said,

01:21:19.792 --> 01:21:23.086
"I thought that tape
had been destroyed."

01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:28.258
More than 30 years
after the original debates,

01:21:28.425 --> 01:21:31.469
he was still furious with Vidal,

01:21:31.637 --> 01:21:34.389
and still shaken
that he had reacted that way.

01:21:35.349 --> 01:21:37.892
- Do you wish you were 20?
- No!

01:21:38.143 --> 01:21:40.186
Absolutely not.

01:21:41.188 --> 01:21:42.897
No, I would...

01:21:43.065 --> 01:21:46.109
If I had a pill which would
reduce my age by 25 years,

01:21:46.277 --> 01:21:48.027
- I wouldn't take it.
- Why not?

01:21:48.195 --> 01:21:50.780
Because I'm tired of life.

01:21:50.948 --> 01:21:52.699
- Are you really?
- Yeah.

01:21:53.993 --> 01:21:54.993
I really am.

01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:58.788
I'm utterly prepared to stop...

01:21:59.623 --> 01:22:00.748
living on.

01:22:01.959 --> 01:22:05.837
Any regrets about this life
that you have lived?

01:22:07.881 --> 01:22:09.465
- Yeah...
- Like what?

01:22:09.633 --> 01:22:11.551
Well, I'm not sure I'd tell you.

01:22:13.721 --> 01:22:17.181
Someone asked when
Bill Buckley died what Gore thought.

01:22:18.601 --> 01:22:23.146
He said, "I thought that hell
will be a livelier place,

01:22:24.773 --> 01:22:28.943
that he will be permanently
among those he served in life,

01:22:30.487 --> 01:22:33.990
applauding their prejudices
and fanning their hatreds."

01:22:35.826 --> 01:22:37.702
The last line of that piece was:

01:22:38.203 --> 01:22:41.080
"WFB, rest in hell."

01:22:42.625 --> 01:22:44.292
It seems a little farfetched to say

01:22:44.460 --> 01:22:47.378
that Gore Vidal was waiting around
for Buckley to die

01:22:47.546 --> 01:22:48.880
so he could have the last word.

01:22:49.131 --> 01:22:52.717
But I promise you
that he took great pleasure in that.

01:22:53.886 --> 01:22:56.846
He was not satisfied if he didn't
have something to fight against.

01:22:57.014 --> 01:22:58.723
And at the end of his life,
I think he was fighting

01:22:58.891 --> 01:23:01.643
against the ghosts
of all these enemies.

01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:04.812
Truman Capote once famously said,

01:23:04.980 --> 01:23:08.900
that it wasn't a matter of when
Gore Vidal would be forgotten,

01:23:09.068 --> 01:23:11.861
it was more or less
when did he start to be forgotten?

01:23:13.197 --> 01:23:15.657
Gore was convinced this had
happened already.

01:23:16.784 --> 01:23:20.244
The young had forgotten him.
His books weren't being read anymore.

01:23:24.583 --> 01:23:27.794
These figures
become most interesting

01:23:27.961 --> 01:23:30.380
when they're not listened to
so much.

01:23:30.589 --> 01:23:33.925
Because then there's a kind of
big silence inside themselves.

01:23:38.013 --> 01:23:41.849
I compared it in an essay I wrote
to Wallace Stevens' great poem,

01:23:42.351 --> 01:23:45.603
The Snowman, where he says,

01:23:45.771 --> 01:23:47.647
"You have to have
a mind of winter

01:23:47.815 --> 01:23:50.900
to see nothing that is not there

01:23:51.068 --> 01:23:53.027
and the nothing that is."

01:24:05.165 --> 01:24:08.042
I think these great debates
are absolutely nonsense.

01:24:09.211 --> 01:24:12.046
The way they're set up, there's
almost no interchange of ideas,

01:24:12.214 --> 01:24:14.048
very little even of personality.

01:24:14.633 --> 01:24:16.926
There's also a terrible thing
about this medium

01:24:17.094 --> 01:24:18.720
that hardly anyone listens.

01:24:19.304 --> 01:24:21.389
They sort of get an impression
of somebody

01:24:21.557 --> 01:24:23.599
and they think they've figured out
just what he's like

01:24:23.767 --> 01:24:25.476
by seeing him on television.

01:24:26.311 --> 01:24:30.565
The Buckley-Vidal debate
was a harbinger

01:24:30.733 --> 01:24:32.150
of an unhappy future.

01:24:34.862 --> 01:24:37.363
Does television run America?

01:24:37.823 --> 01:24:41.909
There is an implicit
conflict of interest

01:24:42.077 --> 01:24:44.662
between that which is
highly viewable

01:24:44.830 --> 01:24:47.915
and that which is
highly illuminating.

01:24:53.839 --> 01:24:58.551
That was a time when
television was still a public square.

01:24:58.719 --> 01:25:03.222
Where Americans gathered and saw
pretty much the same thing.

01:25:03.974 --> 01:25:05.308
There's nothing like that now.

01:25:17.404 --> 01:25:20.281
That's terrifying!

01:25:21.742 --> 01:25:23.743
Well, it's because, see,
we're a debate show.

01:25:23.911 --> 01:25:25.369
- It's like saying--
- No, that'd be great,

01:25:25.537 --> 01:25:27.914
I would love to see a debate show.

01:25:28.081 --> 01:25:30.208
...a 24-hour day where we have
each side on as best we can--

01:25:30.501 --> 01:25:33.127
No. That would be great.
You're doing theater

01:25:33.378 --> 01:25:35.296
when you should be doing debate.

01:25:40.177 --> 01:25:43.346
The ability to talk
the same language is gone.

01:25:43.806 --> 01:25:48.976
More and more, we're divided
into communities of concern.

01:25:49.603 --> 01:25:53.272
Each side can ignore the other side
and live in its own world.

01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:55.024
It makes us less of a nation.

01:25:55.192 --> 01:25:59.487
Because, what binds us together
is the pictures in our heads.

01:25:59.863 --> 01:26:03.866
But if those people
are not sharing those ideas...

01:26:04.701 --> 01:26:06.536
they're not living
in the same place.

01:27:47.012 --> 01:27:49.013
You've got a few more seconds.
Are you capable

01:27:49.181 --> 01:27:51.515
- of summing up in ten seconds?
- No.
