WEBVTT

00:01.668 --> 00:05.297
Thirty-seven light years from Earth,
in the Star System Signus Alpha...

00:05.422 --> 00:08.717
a combat commander
from the planet Octarus fights a battle...

00:08.800 --> 00:12.846
that begins in space, but will subsequently
be fought on American soil.

00:15.807 --> 00:17.434
The Skrill are attempting to escape.

00:17.517 --> 00:19.770
They appear to be successfully doing so.

00:20.228 --> 00:22.189
Andros has his squadron after them.

00:27.611 --> 00:30.864
We are sorry to summon you
so early, Andros.

00:31.239 --> 00:34.618
I don't mind being summoned early.
What I mind is failure.

00:34.701 --> 00:37.495
- Then the Skrill have escaped.
- Yes, Sell.

00:38.246 --> 00:41.625
Fortunately the interceptor guardships
pursuing them were unmanned.

00:41.708 --> 00:43.543
They were making a path for...

00:43.627 --> 00:45.503
What's the name of the planet, Andros?

00:45.587 --> 00:48.715
Terra. Sometimes called Earth.

00:53.636 --> 00:56.222
Do you think
that you can clear up this mess?

00:56.556 --> 00:58.099
Bring the Skrill back?

00:58.224 --> 00:59.976
I'm prepared to leave for Earth.

01:00.060 --> 01:02.103
Perhaps you should take some assistance.

01:02.187 --> 01:05.607
There's an Earth creature with whom
my father and I have worked before.

01:05.732 --> 01:08.401
- I plan on sending word to her.
- Without consulting us?

01:08.568 --> 01:12.280
If you knew Wonder Woman,
you'd know why I've chosen her.

01:14.000 --> 01:20.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:23.416 --> 01:26.961
And there's no question in your mind
that whatever or whoever they are...

01:27.045 --> 01:29.839
they're coming from somewhere
outside of our solar system?

01:29.922 --> 01:32.216
We picked them up
on satellite tracking relay.

01:35.553 --> 01:36.763
What the heck?

02:04.999 --> 02:08.877
We shall be far more efficient recording
instruments using these young minds.

02:09.127 --> 02:10.211
Yes, we shall.

02:30.482 --> 02:33.485
Princess, am I in time to be of service?

02:33.694 --> 02:36.363
As always, your timing
is excellent, Andros.

02:36.447 --> 02:39.992
- These creatures, what are they?
- The Skrill?

02:41.702 --> 02:45.080
A plague, a sickness. Deadly.

02:50.544 --> 02:53.297
These Skrill, what exactly is their crime?

02:53.547 --> 02:55.257
They are thieves, Princess.

02:55.340 --> 02:57.050
- Thieves?
- Let me explain.

02:57.134 --> 03:01.054
The Skrill use these artificial crystals
as storage devices.

03:01.138 --> 03:05.726
They are designed to capture,
condense and store a living mind.

03:05.893 --> 03:07.936
And the Planetary Council allows this?

03:08.020 --> 03:10.564
No. It's illegal, outlawed.

03:10.647 --> 03:13.692
It's a crime to traffic in stolen minds.

03:15.110 --> 03:16.320
That's why I'm here.

03:16.945 --> 03:18.071
I command you...

03:18.572 --> 03:22.034
tell me who you are and what you are.

03:23.493 --> 03:24.536
What?

03:29.583 --> 03:30.792
I am...

03:32.586 --> 03:34.045
the Skrill.

03:41.928 --> 03:43.930
Unquestionably the same human.

03:46.182 --> 03:50.437
In the persona of Diana Prince,
she is vulnerable.

03:53.982 --> 03:58.987
Yes, I do believe that the Sardor
will be quite effective.

04:21.843 --> 04:23.595
Good. We have her.

05:44.633 --> 05:46.010
Let her go.

05:46.719 --> 05:48.095
Let her go!

05:52.307 --> 05:54.727
Don't worry, you'll have your fun.

05:55.185 --> 05:57.980
But let's not waste such a valuable mind.

06:02.151 --> 06:04.987
Patience is not one of the Sardor's virtues.

06:05.070 --> 06:06.947
But first things first.

06:07.739 --> 06:09.950
I'm doing you a favor, Diana.

06:10.159 --> 06:12.411
This way, there'll be no pain.

06:13.370 --> 06:16.540
- Control that beast, Skrill.
- Or what, Andros?

06:16.623 --> 06:19.585
Or I'll beam you
back to prison this instant.

06:26.425 --> 06:27.884
All of you!

06:28.176 --> 06:30.595
You're forgetting the minds
we've already stolen.

06:30.679 --> 06:32.431
You'll never recover them that way.

06:32.514 --> 06:33.724
I'm warning you, Skrill.

06:33.807 --> 06:37.185
I will sacrifice the minds you have
for the life of this lady.

06:38.937 --> 06:42.440
We seem to be at an impasse.
Neither one of us has an advantage.

06:42.524 --> 06:44.901
These bodies we inhabit are gamblers.

06:44.985 --> 06:46.945
How can you be sure you'll win?

06:47.070 --> 06:48.780
Are you willing to gamble?

06:48.864 --> 06:51.658
No more than you are
for the life of Diana Prince.

06:51.950 --> 06:53.994
Like I said, an impasse.

06:54.744 --> 06:58.790
Very much like a scene from one of
their Western movies, isn't it, Andros?

07:12.762 --> 07:14.472
We will meet again.

07:24.482 --> 07:25.733
Princess.

07:48.256 --> 07:49.340
Princess...

07:50.007 --> 07:51.676
are you all right?

07:52.051 --> 07:53.177
Yeah.

07:54.345 --> 07:57.265
I'm a bit shaky, but I think I'm all right.

07:58.224 --> 08:00.143
- The Skrill.
- Escaped.

08:00.977 --> 08:03.271
I had a feeling they would come for you.

08:04.564 --> 08:07.525
That means
that they know who I really am?

08:08.651 --> 08:11.821
Our greatest danger lies
in underestimating them.

08:20.871 --> 08:23.374
Now, Sardor, relax,
there'll be another time.

08:23.457 --> 08:24.583
Will there?

08:24.667 --> 08:27.378
We should have destroyed Andros
when we had the chance.

08:27.461 --> 08:29.547
We never really had the chance, have we?

08:29.630 --> 08:32.674
- A situation I intend to remedy shortly.
- How?

08:32.758 --> 08:34.135
Andros is my worry.

08:34.217 --> 08:37.972
You worry about making sure we leave
this planet with what we came for.

08:38.054 --> 08:39.265
Come on.

09:04.581 --> 09:07.209
- You did get that list, did you not?
- I have it.

09:07.459 --> 09:10.712
Stolen from a computer
at the headquarters of Tertex.

09:11.296 --> 09:12.339
Tertex?

09:12.422 --> 09:15.008
It's an elite group of the best minds
on the continent.

09:15.092 --> 09:18.387
They call it a "think tank. "
It advises the government secretly...

09:18.470 --> 09:20.013
in times of national crises.

09:20.097 --> 09:23.433
This list will lead us to
the most profitable minds on the planet.

09:23.517 --> 09:25.477
Three of them are right here in this area.

09:25.560 --> 09:29.147
- So is Andros.
- I told you, I'll take care of Andros.

09:29.523 --> 09:30.607
Directly.

09:30.691 --> 09:33.485
After my little rendezvous
which I thought up so cleverly.

09:33.568 --> 09:36.238
What about the other one,
Wonder Woman?

09:36.780 --> 09:38.281
Wonder Woman.

09:39.866 --> 09:42.119
We'll let the Sardor take care of her.

09:56.925 --> 09:58.134
- Hello?
- Diana?

09:58.218 --> 10:01.888
It looks like the Skrill have taken over
an abandoned building downtown.

10:01.972 --> 10:04.140
We need to get a hold of Andros
right away.

10:04.224 --> 10:06.434
Andros is here now. Hold on.

10:07.352 --> 10:08.728
It's Steve.

10:08.853 --> 10:09.938
Yes?

10:10.021 --> 10:12.357
Andros, we found some Skrill clothing...

10:12.440 --> 10:15.485
and one of those gauntlets
in an abandoned building downtown.

10:15.568 --> 10:16.653
Where?

10:16.736 --> 10:19.489
13th and Orchard.
They've cleared the area.

10:19.614 --> 10:22.826
Good. Make sure everyone stays away.
Everyone.

10:22.909 --> 10:24.661
-13th and Orchard?
- That's right.

10:24.744 --> 10:27.121
A car will pick you up from there
in two minutes.

10:27.205 --> 10:28.706
I'll be ready.

10:28.832 --> 10:31.417
It could be where they've hidden
the mind banks.

10:31.501 --> 10:32.794
- I'll go with you.
- No.

10:32.877 --> 10:36.548
It's been a long enough morning for you.
I'll let you know what I find out.

10:48.935 --> 10:52.355
Leave now, and stay back with the others.
No one must get in the way.

11:52.289 --> 11:53.958
Steve, it's Diana.

11:55.084 --> 11:56.877
I've been worrying about Andros.

11:56.961 --> 11:58.212
Maybe it's a trap.

11:58.295 --> 12:00.130
He's still the best one to handle it.

12:00.214 --> 12:03.634
And he did ask us to keep everyone away.
And he meant everyone, Diana.

12:03.717 --> 12:05.219
Be patient until wWe hear from him.

12:05.302 --> 12:07.054
Okay, I'll try.

14:08.299 --> 14:09.383
Princess?

14:45.544 --> 14:47.922
- Are you hurt?
- No, I'm fine.

14:50.633 --> 14:52.510
We've got to stop meeting like this.

14:52.801 --> 14:56.472
We seem to have an equally difficult
time staying out of trouble, don't we?

14:56.555 --> 14:59.391
Thanks to this plague
that's befallen your planet.

15:00.851 --> 15:04.438
The Skrill led you to believe
that they were here in order to kill you.

15:05.272 --> 15:06.357
Vermin.

15:06.440 --> 15:08.484
And now that they think
they've succeeded...

15:08.567 --> 15:11.278
they'll rob the Earth until
their mind banks are gutted.

15:11.362 --> 15:13.822
Any idea where they'll strike next?

15:14.156 --> 15:17.284
I wish I did, Princess. I wish I did.

15:29.296 --> 15:33.008
...would be unwise
because it could disturb the-

15:33.091 --> 15:34.968
Senator Wainright!

15:36.428 --> 15:39.640
That's right, son, but I'm afraid
you got the advantage of me.

15:39.723 --> 15:42.476
- You're absolutely right.
- If you could-

15:56.740 --> 15:59.659
I must say you're much prettier
than the other model.

15:59.743 --> 16:04.164
- She was taken ill, you say?
- Just a touch of the...

16:04.331 --> 16:05.373
Flu?

16:06.166 --> 16:10.629
Probably a new boyfriend,
but still, youth must be served.

16:11.379 --> 16:15.508
- Have you been modeling long?
- Just since I started my art classes.

16:16.092 --> 16:20.597
It's an honor to be posing for the
foremost sculptor in the United States.

16:20.847 --> 16:23.558
That's the opinion of some critics.

16:23.683 --> 16:25.060
I'm curious, though.

16:25.143 --> 16:29.355
Why on a project like Tertex
would they want a sculptress?

16:30.231 --> 16:34.819
How would a schoolgirl right out of
modeling class know about Tertex?

16:35.028 --> 16:36.196
How indeed?

16:47.540 --> 16:48.583
Prince.

16:48.791 --> 16:49.876
Where are you now?

16:49.959 --> 16:51.920
About 10 blocks from the complex. Why?

16:52.128 --> 16:53.921
The Skrill have been active again.

16:54.005 --> 16:56.966
- Where?
- Senator Wainright on a public street...

16:57.050 --> 16:59.052
Carla Burgess right out of her studio.

16:59.260 --> 17:02.597
Wainright and Burgess, members of-

17:02.680 --> 17:03.723
Tertex.

17:03.806 --> 17:06.893
Somehow, they got a read-out.
They're using it like a road map.

17:06.976 --> 17:09.060
Who else is in the Washington area?

17:09.228 --> 17:10.480
Just one.

17:11.314 --> 17:13.398
Dr. Paul Eidleman at the university.

17:13.483 --> 17:14.901
I'm heading over there.

17:14.983 --> 17:18.570
No, you're too far away.
I've already contacted the police.

17:18.654 --> 17:20.781
All we can do is wait.

17:21.949 --> 17:24.160
Hope that they find him before the Skrill.

17:56.609 --> 17:58.110
Prof. Eidleman?

18:00.362 --> 18:01.405
Well?

18:01.488 --> 18:03.616
They told me I'd probably find you here.

18:04.658 --> 18:08.203
They should also have told you
I detest being disturbed while I'm eating.

18:08.287 --> 18:11.123
This won't take long.
I just wanted to show you something.

18:11.206 --> 18:14.126
- What've you got there?
- Something quite remarkable, really.

18:14.209 --> 18:16.086
When you place it on-

18:22.634 --> 18:25.888
Just so your adventure
into higher learning isn't a total loss...

18:25.971 --> 18:27.347
Doctor, no!

18:29.057 --> 18:31.143
Forgive me, but I just wanted to see.

18:31.226 --> 18:34.479
Believe me, Doctor,
you don't want to see what this can do.

18:38.692 --> 18:40.485
At least we know who they're after.

18:40.569 --> 18:42.821
We'll stake out
the remaining Tertex members.

18:43.488 --> 18:47.034
If only we could capture one of
these Skrill. Learn their hiding place.

18:47.492 --> 18:49.411
Time. It'll take too much time.

18:50.871 --> 18:55.333
Andros, when the Council sent you here
to capture the Skrill...

18:55.667 --> 18:58.003
- they gave you a time limit, didn't they?
- Yes.

18:58.170 --> 19:00.714
- How much time?
- I was given six days.

19:00.797 --> 19:04.217
- How much time do you have left?
- I have only 48 hours.

19:06.219 --> 19:07.304
Then what happens?

19:07.387 --> 19:09.890
Then the Council will take matters
into their hands.

19:09.973 --> 19:12.309
- What'll they do?
- Decontaminate.

19:14.144 --> 19:15.896
How do they do that?

19:16.521 --> 19:19.733
The Skrill are mad sociopaths.

19:20.358 --> 19:23.612
Now, we have charted
a pattern of their madness.

19:24.446 --> 19:27.699
Arrogance, cruelty,
taking pleasure in giving pain.

19:28.199 --> 19:30.744
Now, we can reproduce
that pattern electronically...

19:30.827 --> 19:32.996
broadcast it at enhanced power...

19:33.079 --> 19:37.709
overload the Skrill's minds, bring them out
unable to control themselves.

19:38.668 --> 19:40.086
Then why don't you do it?

19:40.170 --> 19:42.505
Because Earth is a young planet.

19:42.797 --> 19:46.217
Because humans are young species...

19:46.885 --> 19:48.052
primitive.

19:48.178 --> 19:50.471
I'm sorry, Diana, Steve.

19:50.972 --> 19:54.934
But, yes. Primitive. Warlike.
Often arrogant. Cruel.

19:55.018 --> 19:56.477
In sum, like the Skrill.

19:56.561 --> 19:59.439
This electronic
decontamination broadcast...

19:59.814 --> 20:01.858
what will it do to humans?

20:02.567 --> 20:04.235
For most, nothing.

20:05.653 --> 20:09.574
For a small minority, discomfort.

20:10.408 --> 20:12.827
And for a tiny handful...

20:15.496 --> 20:16.747
madness.

20:19.041 --> 20:21.127
How many is a tiny handful?

20:21.752 --> 20:25.923
For a population of 4 billion odd,
say, perhaps 2 million.

20:26.591 --> 20:30.177
- Two million people driven mad?
- We can't let this happen.

20:30.261 --> 20:31.304
I agree.

20:31.387 --> 20:34.515
But the Council does not.
Unless we locate their hiding places...

20:34.599 --> 20:37.101
and the Skrill themselves
in the time I was given.

20:37.184 --> 20:38.769
They have to give you more time.

20:38.853 --> 20:42.857
Can't you tell the Council that we know
which minds the Skrill are after?

20:42.940 --> 20:45.860
Can't you tell them
that we're trying to capture the Skrill?

20:45.943 --> 20:47.778
You've got to make an appeal.

20:47.903 --> 20:50.614
The Council tends to be unbending
in these matters.

20:50.698 --> 20:52.533
Andros, you've got to try.

20:54.160 --> 20:55.244
Will you?

21:30.988 --> 21:32.448
Earth people believe they know...

21:32.531 --> 21:35.075
how to deal With the Skrill
Without our intervention.

21:35.159 --> 21:37.619
Earth people are little more
than Skrill themselves.

21:37.703 --> 21:40.122
Quiet, Sell. Hear him out.

21:40.664 --> 21:44.376
They believe that because they know
Whose minds the Skrill will be taking...

21:44.459 --> 21:47.588
they have way of capturing them
and locating their hiding place.

21:47.671 --> 21:50.465
They do not think
that the Skrill may think of this?

21:50.674 --> 21:53.552
And who is to prevent them
from changing their plan...

21:53.635 --> 21:56.096
and escaping with the minds
they have already stolen?

21:56.179 --> 21:59.474
Earth people must have a chance
to deal with the Skrill themselves.

21:59.558 --> 22:03.019
- They were. And they failed.
- They need more time.

22:03.103 --> 22:05.313
- How much more time?
- This is not negotiable.

22:05.397 --> 22:08.608
- You have 48 hours.
- Give me 48 hours more.

22:08.900 --> 22:13.155
Decontamination will occur
when and as planned.

22:13.363 --> 22:16.449
You must understand our position,
Andros.

22:17.117 --> 22:18.159
I do.

22:18.326 --> 22:21.162
You're willing to sacrifice 2 million minds.

22:21.246 --> 22:24.791
In order to save
hundreds of millions of others.

22:25.208 --> 22:29.379
You should know better than to waste our
time and yours with this useless bartering.

22:29.462 --> 22:31.047
Go back, Andros.

22:31.548 --> 22:33.633
You and that extraordinary woman...

22:34.134 --> 22:37.429
prepare the planet for what is inevitable.

23:04.789 --> 23:06.124
They said no.

23:10.086 --> 23:13.589
I suggest we use the remaining time
to tell the world what is happening.

23:13.673 --> 23:15.758
And what will be happening.

23:15.925 --> 23:20.096
There's an organization in New York that
represents all the countries of the world.

23:20.179 --> 23:21.764
We should start there.

23:21.848 --> 23:23.683
I'll do everything I can to help.

23:24.600 --> 23:28.229
Eve, get Assistant Secretary General
Nordling on the phone immediately.

23:28.312 --> 23:32.108
He's to arrange a meeting of
the General Assembly as soon as possible.

23:32.608 --> 23:36.070
Andros, you're about to be introduced
to the United Nations.

23:36.153 --> 23:39.198
I only wish
it was under happier circumstances.

24:05.975 --> 24:08.811
We can begin at any time, Mr. Andros.

24:09.812 --> 24:12.898
- Yes, but I was rather hoping that-
- Excuse me.

24:15.985 --> 24:17.027
Yes?

24:18.028 --> 24:20.197
Certainly. Admit her at once.

24:22.324 --> 24:26.286
- I thought I'd have to start without you.
- You should know me better than that.

24:26.495 --> 24:28.414
We can go at any time.

24:29.289 --> 24:30.332
Now.

24:30.416 --> 24:32.000
If you'll please.

24:50.352 --> 24:52.229
Ladies and gentlemen.

24:54.439 --> 24:58.235
Thank you all for allowing us
to address you on such short notice.

24:58.318 --> 25:00.070
But it's important to our planet.

25:00.153 --> 25:02.698
This is Andros, and he will explain.

25:04.282 --> 25:06.827
To begin with, I am not from Earth.

25:10.580 --> 25:12.874
- A question?
- Yes, sir.

25:12.958 --> 25:16.378
Did I understand you to say
that you 're not from this planet?

25:17.003 --> 25:18.421
That is correct, madam.

25:19.172 --> 25:20.215
Thank you, sir.

25:23.552 --> 25:26.513
Is the General Assembly in session,
Officer?

25:26.596 --> 25:29.891
That's right. But all press corps personnel
should be inside by now.

25:29.975 --> 25:31.476
Yes, but I'm not local, sir.

25:31.559 --> 25:34.562
Actually, I write for the youth page
for the Washington Sun...

25:34.646 --> 25:37.440
and the commuter flight
ran a little bit late this morning.

25:37.524 --> 25:39.234
We'll have to check it out.

25:39.317 --> 25:40.652
I should hope you would.

26:11.599 --> 26:13.434
So I'm afraid...

26:13.518 --> 26:16.104
your nations have no alternative...

26:16.229 --> 26:18.940
but to prepare
for the decontamination process.

26:23.611 --> 26:25.988
As Andros explained, only a minority...

26:26.072 --> 26:28.366
of your countries 'populations
will be affected.

26:28.449 --> 26:31.744
But you must make sure
the medical facilities and authorities...

26:31.828 --> 26:33.746
are prepared to handle these people.

26:33.830 --> 26:36.707
And you must do so in the next 18 hours.

26:37.124 --> 26:40.419
The decontamination process
is scheduled to begin at that time.

26:45.633 --> 26:47.134
I'm sorry.

26:49.637 --> 26:51.847
Ladies and gentlemen, please!

26:51.931 --> 26:54.725
Come to order.
We must discuss this immediately.

26:54.809 --> 26:56.477
Come to order, please.

26:56.602 --> 27:00.981
Please, ladies and gentlemen, let us
collect ourselves to discuss this matter.

27:01.732 --> 27:04.735
We understand that you feel you have
some special problems...

27:04.819 --> 27:06.320
concerning what you just heard?

27:06.403 --> 27:10.866
My country, for instance,
boasts five Nobel Prize winners.

27:10.950 --> 27:13.994
Is there not some way
you can protect their minds at least...

27:14.078 --> 27:16.789
from this dreadful decontamination?

27:18.791 --> 27:21.835
As I said, the process should not affect-

27:21.919 --> 27:24.546
I'm sorry, there is a security problem,
Mr. Secretary.

27:24.630 --> 27:27.299
We've arranged for another room,
if you'll come with us.

27:27.383 --> 27:29.176
This is most unusual.

27:31.220 --> 27:33.597
- Skrill.
- That's correct, Andros.

27:33.681 --> 27:36.058
Cooperate, and these people
will be unharmed.

27:36.141 --> 27:37.684
But if any of you move...

27:37.768 --> 27:41.396
These distinguished citizens
will be in danger of being...

27:41.855 --> 27:43.190
extinguished.

27:43.524 --> 27:44.650
She's fainting.

27:45.984 --> 27:47.611
What do you want?

27:48.028 --> 27:49.196
Andros.

27:58.580 --> 27:59.623
Get down.

29:06.356 --> 29:08.608
Wonder Woman, you're all right?

29:09.275 --> 29:10.777
I'm fine. What happened?

29:10.860 --> 29:13.029
We were helping the guards
evacuate the people.

29:13.112 --> 29:16.157
Then one of the guards, a young woman,
she stopped him...

29:16.240 --> 29:19.911
she said you were being overcome.
She was so convincing.

29:20.036 --> 29:22.080
I guess his thoughts were all for you.

29:22.163 --> 29:25.083
He started out,
there was a flash then, and he...

29:28.586 --> 29:29.962
Is he dead?

29:30.630 --> 29:33.424
No, but his mind is gone.

29:59.617 --> 30:01.494
No medications, Doctor?

30:01.952 --> 30:04.663
I don't know enough
about his metabolism.

30:05.790 --> 30:09.376
The fact that he has two hearts
complicates matters enough.

30:09.460 --> 30:12.338
I'm sorry, Diana.
I'm no more capable of treating Andros...

30:12.421 --> 30:15.090
than a witch doctor is up to
doing a brain transplant.

30:16.091 --> 30:17.176
I'm sorry.

30:17.968 --> 30:20.304
I understand, Doctor. Thank you.

31:18.612 --> 31:22.199
I am of the Earth,
but I'm also immortal and an Amazon.

31:22.282 --> 31:24.785
I found a kinship with Andros
from your World.

31:24.868 --> 31:26.411
What has happened to Andros?

31:27.329 --> 31:29.956
His mind has been captured by the Skrill.

31:30.415 --> 31:32.918
We feared as much
when we lost all contact.

31:33.001 --> 31:34.461
Can you help him?

31:34.544 --> 31:35.587
No.

31:35.670 --> 31:36.963
There's gotta be something-

31:37.047 --> 31:38.882
There is nothing we can do.

31:38.965 --> 31:42.844
We are no less vulnerable to the Skrill
than the rest of the universe.

31:42.928 --> 31:45.305
And that is why they must be destroyed.

31:45.388 --> 31:48.433
Andros told me what you intend to do.
It's horrible.

31:48.516 --> 31:49.851
It's regrettable.

31:49.976 --> 31:52.479
The Skrill must not leave your planet.

31:52.562 --> 31:56.066
They would vanish into the galaxy
if they were to escape now.

31:56.149 --> 31:59.402
The decontamination will create
havoc on my planet.

31:59.486 --> 32:02.155
There will be casualties, yes.

32:02.363 --> 32:05.241
There would be countless more
throughout the universe...

32:05.325 --> 32:07.619
if we did not decontaminate.

32:08.119 --> 32:09.704
You must realize that.

32:09.787 --> 32:13.625
I realize that the bureaucracy running
your galaxy is no more compassionate...

32:13.708 --> 32:15.877
or intelligent than any other bureaucracy.

32:15.960 --> 32:17.003
You are impertinent.

32:17.086 --> 32:20.298
And you're ready to destroy my world
in order to save it!

32:21.215 --> 32:24.135
The decontamination is still set
for three hours from now?

32:24.218 --> 32:26.137
It will occur in...

32:27.889 --> 32:31.059
165 of your Earth minutes.

32:31.434 --> 32:34.896
Then I have that much time
to try and capture the Skrill myself.

32:35.313 --> 32:39.567
I apologize if I seem indifferent to
your people's fate, Wonder Woman.

32:40.568 --> 32:42.695
Andros has great faith in you.

32:43.112 --> 32:45.448
And we think highly of Andros.

32:48.075 --> 32:50.328
I truly hope you succeed.

33:29.867 --> 33:34.371
That is a list of exactly where and when
the Skrill were spotted.

33:34.455 --> 33:36.040
And this...

33:42.129 --> 33:43.547
tells you precisely...

33:43.630 --> 33:46.633
where the members of Tertex
were when their minds were stolen.

33:46.717 --> 33:50.387
We've got to find their hiding place, Ira.
We only have two hours left.

33:50.471 --> 33:52.890
Data just received is being analyzed...

33:52.973 --> 33:57.227
for any pattern which would indicate
a possible center of operations.

33:57.644 --> 33:58.896
Thank you, Ira.

33:58.979 --> 34:03.567
This is all you can tell me about the
whereabouts and movements of the Skrill?

34:03.859 --> 34:04.902
I'm afraid so.

34:04.985 --> 34:08.780
We captured one member of the Skrill
who'd taken over the body of a student.

34:08.864 --> 34:11.449
All she told us is that they were hiding
in the woods.

34:11.533 --> 34:14.620
The Woods? This will also be considered.

34:25.672 --> 34:28.425
- You got something?
- Negative.

34:29.676 --> 34:32.219
- Nothing?
- Insufficient data.

34:32.304 --> 34:35.764
The activities of the Skrill
which you ha ve entered do not suggest...

34:35.849 --> 34:37.893
a center of operations.

34:37.976 --> 34:41.146
Particularly since a wooded area
was stipulated.

34:42.688 --> 34:44.608
Do you have any suggestions?

34:44.690 --> 34:45.775
Your only hope...

34:45.859 --> 34:50.030
is to have Wonder Woman re-interrogate
the captured member of the Skrill.

34:50.614 --> 34:52.991
If you can find Wonder Woman.

34:56.077 --> 34:58.079
Where are you hiding?

34:59.372 --> 35:00.582
Answer him.

35:01.916 --> 35:04.294
We're hiding in the wilderness.

35:05.253 --> 35:06.755
In the woods.

35:07.922 --> 35:10.008
There must be something more
you can tell us.

35:10.091 --> 35:11.426
There is nothing more.

35:11.509 --> 35:13.970
Too bad we didn't capture
one of their ring leaders.

35:14.053 --> 35:16.639
At least this one has seen
their hiding place.

35:16.764 --> 35:20.101
Maybe you don't know exactly where it is,
but you can describe it.

35:20.184 --> 35:21.686
I already have.

35:21.769 --> 35:24.564
Do it again. I want every detail.

35:25.440 --> 35:27.108
It's in the woods.

35:27.483 --> 35:31.446
There are trees, bushes, grass...

35:31.988 --> 35:34.866
and a hill, with rocks...

35:35.283 --> 35:37.160
- and a cave.
- A cave?

35:37.994 --> 35:40.621
A tunnel, going through the hill.

35:40.997 --> 35:42.248
A tunnel?

35:42.623 --> 35:45.126
Now, let's see.
There's no mine shafts around here...

35:45.209 --> 35:46.878
no old railroad tunnels.

35:46.961 --> 35:49.088
We've checked all the
underground aqueducts.

35:49.172 --> 35:52.800
- What else?
- It's in the woods. With animals.

35:53.384 --> 35:55.595
At least, there used to be animals.

35:56.679 --> 35:57.763
Animals?

35:58.681 --> 35:59.807
A zoo.

36:00.516 --> 36:03.519
Isn't there an old zoo
just outside the city?

36:03.603 --> 36:04.854
In Maryland?

36:05.313 --> 36:07.773
Yeah, but I wouldn't exactly
call that wilderness.

36:07.857 --> 36:12.361
The landscaping for the animals,
trees, grass, rocks...

36:12.486 --> 36:15.197
from the inside
it would look like a wilderness.

36:15.281 --> 36:16.824
Especially to aliens.

36:17.074 --> 36:19.201
Yeah, that would explain the tunnel, too.

36:19.452 --> 36:20.870
It's worth a try.

36:21.328 --> 36:23.164
Give me Maj. Zimmerman, right away.

36:23.247 --> 36:27.710
You'll be wrong. You'll never get us.
And you'll never save Andros either.

37:19.886 --> 37:22.264
Get the mind banks
ready for evacuation. Hurry!

37:22.347 --> 37:24.057
Leaving without saying goodbye?

37:27.269 --> 37:28.353
Fire!

37:45.370 --> 37:49.291
This is what you used to lure him to me.
Let's see how you like it.

38:02.137 --> 38:05.306
Now, Wonder Woman,
it's time to say good night.

40:04.174 --> 40:05.801
This must be it.

40:06.969 --> 40:10.013
His mind. Unbelievable.

40:17.020 --> 40:18.105
How does it work?

40:18.188 --> 40:21.525
I think, by simple physical contact.

40:29.449 --> 40:30.701
Thank you, Princess.

40:33.036 --> 40:35.455
- You're welcome.
- It's incredible.

40:35.706 --> 40:36.957
I agree.

40:37.040 --> 40:40.669
Doctor, I can show you how to perform
this small miracle for all of these.

40:40.752 --> 40:43.964
- What about the Skrill?
- I will remove them.

40:44.631 --> 40:47.425
First, Doctor, let's restore the others.

41:00.647 --> 41:01.731
Who are you?

41:01.815 --> 41:04.484
- My name is Andros.
- What is this?

41:04.567 --> 41:07.070
- Where am I?
- You'll know the whole story in time.

41:08.029 --> 41:11.032
They want to know
what they should do with the Skrill now.

41:11.116 --> 41:13.618
Nothing. I'll do the rest.

41:14.786 --> 41:17.455
Johnny, Kim, Karen...

41:17.956 --> 41:20.083
you're okay, don't worry about it.

41:41.896 --> 41:43.731
That's a pretty good trick.

41:44.148 --> 41:46.401
You mind telling me
what you did with them?

41:46.484 --> 41:49.445
They've been incarcerated,
light-years from here.

41:49.529 --> 41:53.574
I doubt they'll be back to plunder
your world, or anyone's, for a long time.

41:55.284 --> 41:57.787
Thank you, Andros,
for everything you've done for us.

41:57.870 --> 41:59.997
Our whole planet thanks you.

42:00.873 --> 42:04.544
And Diana asked for me to apologize
for her not being here.

42:04.627 --> 42:06.045
She said you'd understand.

42:08.673 --> 42:10.174
Thank you, Major.

42:12.260 --> 42:13.552
Déjà vu.

42:13.928 --> 42:17.890
The last time we said goodbye was when?
In 1943.

42:18.557 --> 42:21.185
Perhaps we should
keep track of our hellos instead.

42:21.560 --> 42:22.687
Even better-

42:22.853 --> 42:24.480
Don't ask me that.

42:27.775 --> 42:30.194
I know a planet with eight moons.

42:31.028 --> 42:34.073
They fill a night sky
like jewels in a crown.

42:37.243 --> 42:39.036
You'd be beautiful under that sky.

42:40.579 --> 42:43.415
Andros, I can't.

42:44.124 --> 42:45.292
I'm needed here.

42:51.966 --> 42:53.425
Yes, you are.

42:57.346 --> 42:59.056
So, Princess...

42:59.264 --> 43:00.516
until...

43:01.016 --> 43:02.267
whenever.

43:04.603 --> 43:06.480
Until whenever.

44:19.469 --> 44:22.972
Sorry not to have been
of greater assistance earlier.

44:23.389 --> 44:26.810
That's okay, Ira.
Re-interrogating that prisoner paid off.

44:27.018 --> 44:30.688
We were able to capture the rest of them
before the Council decontaminated.

44:30.772 --> 44:33.191
Thanks to Wonder Woman, no doubt.

44:33.942 --> 44:35.235
Affirmative.

44:35.318 --> 44:37.529
Where are the Skrill being held?

44:37.737 --> 44:39.405
Andros teleported them...

44:39.489 --> 44:42.951
to a rehabilitation facility
in the Star System Cynnus Alpha.

44:43.034 --> 44:47.121
Did it occur to you to ask for my records
on how the transportation...

44:47.205 --> 44:51.292
oflittle green men to a place
37 light-years away was achieved?

44:51.584 --> 44:54.670
Gee, I'm sorry, Ira. Next time I'll ask.

44:55.380 --> 44:57.882
Besides, they were
little green men and women.

44:57.965 --> 44:59.717
And what of Andros?

44:59.801 --> 45:01.010
He's gone.

45:01.677 --> 45:04.847
He returned to his ship
that's orbiting outside the Earth.

45:04.931 --> 45:08.142
He is on his way back
to the planet Octarus?

45:08.351 --> 45:12.772
Yes. And it's only 29 light-years away.
So he should be there by now.

45:13.022 --> 45:14.815
That is also unfortunate.

45:14.899 --> 45:18.110
Sorry. Had there been time,
I'm sure Andros would have enjoyed...

45:18.194 --> 45:20.154
a scintillating conversation with you.

45:20.237 --> 45:21.489
Affirmative.

45:21.572 --> 45:25.242
I am sure he found his interaction
with people on this planet...

45:25.326 --> 45:27.370
as uninspiring as I do.

45:27.536 --> 45:30.373
Well, lucky for you
that that's the end of my report.

45:30.456 --> 45:32.500
I won't have to bore you anymore tonight.

45:32.583 --> 45:35.419
Do not go away mad. Just go away.

45:36.921 --> 45:39.423
I see the lab boys are still trying
to program you...

45:39.507 --> 45:41.509
- with a sense of humor.
- Affirmative.

45:41.592 --> 45:45.262
They wish to make working with
an I.R.A.C. computer eight hours a day...

45:45.346 --> 45:47.014
more pleasant.

45:47.223 --> 45:49.266
I think
they may be defeating their purpose.

45:49.350 --> 45:51.435
I am reminded of a joke.

45:52.311 --> 45:55.064
I hope it's not as old as your last one.

45:55.272 --> 45:58.192
- Knock, knock.
- Oh, Ira.

45:58.776 --> 46:01.904
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?

46:01.987 --> 46:03.030
I.R.A. C.

46:03.113 --> 46:04.198
I.R.A.C. who?

46:04.281 --> 46:07.117
I rack my brains to make you look clever.

46:12.998 --> 46:15.000
I think I was better off boring you.

46:15.125 --> 46:16.668
But I have more.

46:16.752 --> 46:18.462
That's what I was afraid of.

46:18.545 --> 46:19.963
Good night, Ira.

46:20.339 --> 46:21.757
Miss Prince?

46:23.425 --> 46:24.635
Yes, Ira?

46:24.801 --> 46:28.513
Did you hear the one
about the female computer?

46:28.597 --> 46:29.640
No.

46:30.057 --> 46:31.600
She miscalculated.

46:34.311 --> 46:35.520
Good night...

46:35.646 --> 46:37.731
Miss Princess.

47:26.154 --> 47:28.531
I know a planet with eight moons.

47:29.532 --> 47:32.160
They fill a night sky
like jewels in a crown.

47:32.243 --> 47:34.204
You'd be beautiful under that sky.

47:37.081 --> 47:39.083
Until whenever, Andros.

47:42.545 --> 47:43.838
Whenever.

48:29.091 --> 48:30.134
