WEBVTT

00:22.564 --> 00:25.316
I really thought what I would do

00:25.317 --> 00:28.536
if I ever learned to draw properly

00:28.695 --> 00:32.039
was I would try to
change the world.

02:47.751 --> 02:49.594
Is this thing working?

02:49.878 --> 02:53.756
Right now, Ralph, what
exactly are we doing here?

02:53.757 --> 02:57.009
It's a very odd
idea to make a movie,

02:57.010 --> 02:59.637
a film, a documentary,

02:59.638 --> 03:02.306
about an artist, say me.

03:02.307 --> 03:04.975
And in one way it's
rather a good idea,

03:04.976 --> 03:09.397
and in another way you
wonder why one is doing it.

03:09.398 --> 03:13.025
Except that it's become

03:13.026 --> 03:17.363
far more personal as it's developed

03:17.364 --> 03:20.866
into something which really
is about my work and about me.

03:20.867 --> 03:23.619
And I think that makes
it more interesting

03:23.620 --> 03:26.706
because it takes in
the good and the bad.

03:26.707 --> 03:30.928
It takes in all
sides, all dimensions.

03:34.214 --> 03:38.968
It's almost, when you
come down to see us,

03:38.969 --> 03:42.304
we know what we're going to do, even
though we haven't planned anything.

03:42.305 --> 03:45.099
We just simply carry on
and if something comes out,

03:45.100 --> 03:47.476
something does, and
sometimes it doesn't.

03:47.477 --> 03:49.562
And so that seems to me

03:49.563 --> 03:53.863
the kind of thing that's
made this all worthwhile.

04:01.783 --> 04:06.834
I haven't seen Ralph since the
signing of Hunter's memorial poster.

04:06.955 --> 04:09.874
It's been a while, and I've
really been looking forward

04:09.875 --> 04:13.549
to catching up with him in
his studio at Loose Court.

04:17.214 --> 04:19.308
Right.

04:21.678 --> 04:24.601
I'm gonna put a piece
of paper down here.

04:25.015 --> 04:28.684
I don't know why. I think it's
because you're in the room.

04:28.685 --> 04:33.065
If you weren't here,
I'd be having a lie-down now.

04:36.026 --> 04:37.318
Are you ready for this?

04:37.319 --> 04:41.119
'Cause it might not be very
good, but it might be great, too.

04:42.199 --> 04:44.872
I love it.

04:58.799 --> 05:00.883
When I don't know what to do,

05:00.884 --> 05:02.593
I do that.

05:02.594 --> 05:07.056
It's a kind of cheat, in a
way, because you don't know

05:07.057 --> 05:10.392
whether you did it because

05:10.393 --> 05:13.062
you can't do anything and
there is nothing in your mind,

05:13.063 --> 05:15.907
or you did it because it
might just lead somewhere.

05:39.589 --> 05:41.841
It's fantastic when that happens.

05:42.300 --> 05:45.644
I can see a horse in there already.

05:56.898 --> 05:58.232
I didn't know what it was

05:58.233 --> 06:00.735
and then I suddenly
thought, "I know what it is."

06:01.236 --> 06:03.279
It's an unloved pet,

06:03.280 --> 06:06.574
and it's a shame that
I drew it, really,

06:06.575 --> 06:08.784
because I don't like it.

06:08.785 --> 06:11.120
It's a horrible-looking creature.

06:11.121 --> 06:14.999
And if it walked into the
living room, I'd kick it out.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.458
And it's a frame of mind.

06:16.459 --> 06:18.961
All I've done is made something

06:18.962 --> 06:21.797
that's part of a frame of mind
I might be in at the moment.

06:21.798 --> 06:24.221
What a terrible thing.

06:40.817 --> 06:44.403
It was 1969 when my
first book was published.

06:44.404 --> 06:46.155
It was a collected works

06:46.156 --> 06:51.076
of all my cartoons that I had done
since I had taken it seriously.

06:51.077 --> 06:53.579
That's absolutely amazing.

07:04.424 --> 07:07.676
This was the beginning,
really, the conducted tour,

07:07.677 --> 07:10.012
and the whole idea of
it being The Pioneers,

07:10.013 --> 07:14.350
it's like you're going, you know,
we're going off on a conducted tour

07:14.351 --> 07:16.435
and everything's comfortable.

07:16.436 --> 07:20.814
And they'd just get off the bus,
look around and get back on again.

07:20.815 --> 07:24.902
And then I thought of this
when they brought Muzak in.

07:24.903 --> 07:27.696
So I did the picture called
Down at the Old Bull and Bush.

07:27.697 --> 07:29.365
And there's the old
boy with his pint

07:29.366 --> 07:33.452
and then all this Muzak
coming out of the speaker.

07:33.453 --> 07:37.423
Because it was really only just
getting going, all this stuff.

08:00.146 --> 08:02.398
Part of my idea of humor

08:02.440 --> 08:06.365
was it would be slightly maniacal.

08:13.368 --> 08:16.036
But there was an arrogance missing.

08:16.037 --> 08:19.081
There was a wildness missing.

08:19.082 --> 08:22.005
There was a rawness missing.

08:22.127 --> 08:28.048
It lacked that bite I needed,
that real ferocious bite,

08:28.049 --> 08:31.428
the thing that would
make it noticeable.

08:39.394 --> 08:42.773
Still as relevant
today as it was then.

08:43.940 --> 08:47.444
Great. Amazing. Just incredible.

08:49.696 --> 08:52.072
The reason I learned to draw

08:52.073 --> 08:55.617
wasn't just to be able to draw
and people say, "That's pretty,"

08:55.618 --> 08:59.839
but that I needed to apply
it as a weapon almost.

09:00.957 --> 09:04.131
It was something quite savage.

09:05.587 --> 09:07.421
People would see the work

09:07.422 --> 09:10.175
and they would think about it.

09:16.806 --> 09:19.980
In a way, it was a
wonderful calling card.

09:20.894 --> 09:23.647
I took it with me to America.

09:23.772 --> 09:26.024
And that was 1970.

09:48.046 --> 09:50.005
Bus for New York City.

09:50.006 --> 09:53.342
Hey, driver, hold up.
I'm trying to get on.

09:53.343 --> 09:55.390
Hold up, man.

09:56.096 --> 09:58.724
All right. Thanks a lot.

09:59.724 --> 10:03.894
My idea was actually to do a
thousand pictures of New York.

10:03.895 --> 10:05.187
Well...

10:05.188 --> 10:07.272
What I was looking for
were things to draw.

10:07.273 --> 10:10.692
New York, skyscrapers
and everything.

10:10.693 --> 10:13.366
It's God's own city, man.

10:13.488 --> 10:16.198
Hey, what's up, man?
Hey, you look fine.

10:16.199 --> 10:19.201
What you trying to make
yourself five bucks for, bro?

10:19.202 --> 10:21.537
Yeah. Hey, hey.

10:21.538 --> 10:25.008
Just run across, man. Just run
across the street. Come on, man.

10:25.583 --> 10:27.334
What it does for me,

10:27.335 --> 10:29.378
it freezes a moment,

10:29.379 --> 10:31.713
that when I look back on it,

10:31.714 --> 10:34.883
I think, "Goodness me.
Did that really happen?"

10:34.884 --> 10:36.718
You know, it's just something

10:36.719 --> 10:40.764
that is frozen in time
and it's gonna change.

10:40.765 --> 10:43.142
Nothing stays the same.

11:07.167 --> 11:12.462
I found it upsetting seeing all these
vagrant people wandering the streets

11:12.463 --> 11:15.933
and always staggering towards you

11:16.301 --> 11:19.930
and grabbing you by the hand.

11:20.305 --> 11:25.058
And saying, "Give us a dime, buddy.
This is a tough city to get started in."

11:25.059 --> 11:28.187
It's hopeless. I could never do it.

11:28.188 --> 11:29.396
Yeah.

11:29.397 --> 11:33.276
And I wanted to capture
that sort of look, that face.

11:57.800 --> 12:00.719
I was drawn towards skid row,
I was drawn towards it

12:00.720 --> 12:07.148
as a sort of almost a museum
of misery and deprivation.

12:10.480 --> 12:14.233
And I think this is
a picture of a bum,

12:14.234 --> 12:16.401
and he's hanging
onto a fire hydrant,

12:16.402 --> 12:20.197
and there's a woman saying, "Why don't
you get up and get yourself a job?"

12:20.198 --> 12:21.823
You know, that sort of thing.

12:21.824 --> 12:25.244
"You're lyin' about on the
pavement doin' nothin'."

12:25.245 --> 12:28.123
"Leave me alone,
lady. Leave me alone."

12:36.130 --> 12:39.716
I think my experience in New York

12:39.717 --> 12:44.222
gave me the conviction
that I needed

12:45.181 --> 12:49.151
to make this the work of my life.

12:49.978 --> 12:55.075
I needed it to reassure myself
that I wasn't wasting my time.

12:55.942 --> 13:02.239
Cartooning meant more to me
than just doing funny pictures.

13:02.240 --> 13:07.462
It meant to change
things for the better.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.732
While I was in New York,

13:33.104 --> 13:35.777
I got a phone call.

13:42.280 --> 13:43.447
Hello?

13:43.448 --> 13:47.242
To go and meet an ex-Hells
Angel who just shaved his head,

13:47.243 --> 13:49.120
Hunter S. Thompson.

13:51.581 --> 13:53.879
Hunter, he always called you
in the middle of the night.

13:53.958 --> 13:57.127
It was always 3:00, 4:00 in the
morning. You knew it was Hunter.

13:57.128 --> 14:00.381
He said, "God damn it." He
always said, "God damn it."

14:00.757 --> 14:03.592
"Gotta go to the Kentucky Derby." Well,
it was, like, Wednesday or Thursday.

14:03.593 --> 14:05.010
Kentucky Derby was Saturday.

14:05.011 --> 14:08.388
I was like, "Well, okay, you wanna
go to the Kentucky Derby, we'll go."

14:08.389 --> 14:12.184
He says, "Well, a photographer?"
I said, "We'll find somebody."

14:12.185 --> 14:15.604
So, it was short notice, so I
thought of this guy Ralph Steadman,

14:15.605 --> 14:19.066
who was a British cartoonist
whose work I'd seen many times,

14:19.067 --> 14:21.943
very evil-minded,
twisted kind of guy.

14:21.944 --> 14:25.739
And so we dragged him to Kentucky

14:25.740 --> 14:30.410
and they ended up going through this
haze of alcohol and drugs, madness,

14:30.411 --> 14:34.757
and so they became part
of the story themselves.

14:39.921 --> 14:41.880
The next day was heavy.

14:41.881 --> 14:45.425
With 30 hours to post time,
I had no press credentials,

14:45.426 --> 14:48.637
and according to the sports editor
of the Louisville Courier-Journal,

14:48.638 --> 14:50.811
no hope at all of getting any.

14:52.809 --> 14:55.310
Worse, I needed two sets.

14:55.311 --> 14:57.813
One for myself and
another for Ralph Steadman,

14:57.814 --> 15:00.399
the English illustrator who was
coming all the way from London

15:00.400 --> 15:02.698
to do some derby drawings.

15:05.071 --> 15:09.866
All I knew about him was that this was
his first visit to the United States,

15:09.867 --> 15:13.912
and the more I pondered that
fact, the more it gave me fear.

15:13.913 --> 15:16.248
Would he bear up under
the heinous culture shock

15:16.249 --> 15:17.916
of being lifted out of London

15:17.917 --> 15:22.513
and plunged into a drunken mob
scene at the Kentucky Derby?

15:23.714 --> 15:26.967
We had to find each
other, as it were.

15:26.968 --> 15:29.687
Oh, God. Where is he?

15:33.474 --> 15:39.646
Eventually, I heard this
voice behind me saying,

15:39.647 --> 15:41.990
"Excuse me.

15:42.733 --> 15:46.407
"Are you... Are
you Ralph Steadman?"

15:54.245 --> 15:56.918
He said, "Would you like a drink?"

15:57.665 --> 16:00.964
Anyway, we went on
this binge for a week.

16:04.964 --> 16:07.757
I was making notes and drawing.

16:07.758 --> 16:13.054
Hunter said, "It's a filthy habit you've
got there, scribbling dark pictures.

16:13.055 --> 16:16.354
"And around these
parts that's an insult."

16:16.726 --> 16:20.526
He said, "I've got a horrible feeling
we're gonna have to get out of here."

16:24.650 --> 16:29.280
From that point on, the weekend
became a vicious drunken nightmare.

16:31.073 --> 16:33.575
We both went completely to pieces,

16:33.576 --> 16:37.204
and since poor Steadman had no
choice but to take what came his way,

16:37.205 --> 16:40.083
he was subjected to
shock after shock.

16:44.587 --> 16:47.339
We sort of went along
with whatever happened,

16:47.340 --> 16:49.257
and we'd made that agreement

16:49.258 --> 16:52.093
with ourselves, you
know, between each other.

16:52.094 --> 16:54.346
"That's what we do. We just
go and see what happens."

16:54.347 --> 16:57.225
"I'll do the drawings,
you write," you know?

17:03.981 --> 17:07.906
So that became the
beginning of Gonzo.

17:21.832 --> 17:23.875
Now, looking down
from the press box,

17:23.876 --> 17:27.796
I pointed to the huge grassy
meadow enclosed by the track.

17:27.797 --> 17:30.757
"That whole thing," I said,
"will be jammed with people,

17:30.758 --> 17:34.010
"50,000 or so, most of
them staggering drunk.

17:34.011 --> 17:37.305
"It's a fantastic scene,
thousands of people fainting,

17:37.306 --> 17:42.312
"crying, copulating, trampling each other
and fighting with broken whiskey bottles."

18:00.663 --> 18:02.163
I think what he saw,

18:02.164 --> 18:05.584
in our connection, was
somebody that somehow

18:05.585 --> 18:08.837
saw the thing in pictures as
he saw it in words, you know.

18:08.838 --> 18:12.882
And that seemed to me to be part
of the whole chemistry of it,

18:12.883 --> 18:16.136
that our chemistry there
made Gonzo possible.

18:18.347 --> 18:20.432
"What I'm trying to
find," he said, Hunter,

18:20.433 --> 18:25.188
"is a certain kind of Kentucky face,
the face of the Kentucky Derby."

18:27.565 --> 18:31.526
And the point is that
by the end of the week,

18:31.527 --> 18:33.236
the very face we were looking for

18:33.237 --> 18:37.207
was us looking back at
ourselves in the mirror.

18:43.873 --> 18:46.796
- I don't recognize anyone anymore.
- Yeah.

18:56.302 --> 19:00.352
What I in fact had done,
without realizing it,

19:00.556 --> 19:04.643
- was scored a bull's-eye
first time... - Yeah.

19:04.644 --> 19:06.686
On my first visit to America.

19:06.687 --> 19:12.651
I mean, I met up with the one man
I needed to meet in all the world,

19:12.652 --> 19:17.077
- in the whole of America, to work with.
- Yeah.

19:24.038 --> 19:28.291
I got very depressed when I got
back on the plane to England,

19:28.292 --> 19:30.960
because I was going
to have to go back

19:30.961 --> 19:35.340
to a completely
conventional cartoon job.

19:35.341 --> 19:40.347
And that really didn't
fill me with much happiness.

20:06.747 --> 20:09.290
Let's go, Beanie.

20:09.291 --> 20:11.793
Now, take it easy.

20:32.857 --> 20:37.078
A bit... Ever so free.

21:35.503 --> 21:37.962
A phone call came
and it was Hunter.

21:37.963 --> 21:39.923
"Ralph, I've got this manuscript.

21:39.924 --> 21:44.469
"Could you do us a dozen drawings
of something that could go with it?"

21:44.470 --> 21:46.392
"Well," I said, "I'll try."

21:52.436 --> 21:55.985
And I just set about it.

21:56.649 --> 21:58.817
Got myself some booze as well,

21:58.818 --> 22:03.243
'cause I seemed to need to be
a bit drunk to do it, you know.

22:08.869 --> 22:11.496
I did about a dozen drawings,

22:11.497 --> 22:14.716
rolled them up in a
tube and sent them off.

22:31.100 --> 22:34.435
"We were somewhere around
Barstow on the edge of the desert

22:34.436 --> 22:36.771
"when the drugs began to take hold.

22:36.772 --> 22:38.523
"I remember saying something like,

22:38.524 --> 22:42.026
"'I feel a bit light-headed.
Maybe you should drive.'

22:42.027 --> 22:44.904
"And suddenly there was a
terrible roar all around us

22:44.905 --> 22:48.408
"and the sky was full of
what looked like huge bats,

22:48.409 --> 22:51.995
"all swooping and screeching
and diving around the car,

22:51.996 --> 22:53.746
"which was going about
100 miles an hour

22:53.747 --> 22:57.467
"with the top down to Las Vegas."

23:03.924 --> 23:05.925
When Fear and Loathing
in Las Vegas came out,

23:05.926 --> 23:07.844
I think people were stunned by it.

23:07.845 --> 23:10.138
I mean, nobody had really
seen anything like that.

23:10.139 --> 23:13.725
It was a full-out celebration of
the most outrageous kind of behavior,

23:13.726 --> 23:16.228
and then it was so...

23:16.645 --> 23:22.026
Funny and dangerous
and eccentric and wild.

23:23.068 --> 23:27.072
Looks like it's gonna be a
classic of 20th century literature.

23:36.165 --> 23:38.917
So you're down on the main
floor playing blackjack

23:38.918 --> 23:41.796
and the stakes are getting high.

23:43.380 --> 23:45.423
When suddenly you chance to look up

23:45.424 --> 23:47.383
and there, right
smack above your head,

23:47.384 --> 23:49.302
is a half-naked 14-year-old girl

23:49.303 --> 23:52.972
being chased through the
air by a snarling Wolverine,

23:52.973 --> 23:57.393
which is suddenly locked in a death
battle with two silver-painted Polacks,

23:57.394 --> 24:00.396
who come swinging down
from opposite balconies

24:00.397 --> 24:04.197
and meet in mid-air on
the wolverine's neck.

24:11.575 --> 24:13.993
And no one had seen
anything like this before,

24:13.994 --> 24:16.997
certainly not in
American illustration.

24:17.831 --> 24:20.541
And the pictures really
weren't about the story,

24:20.542 --> 24:23.628
but they were a
reflection of the story,

24:23.629 --> 24:26.757
of what was in Hunter's mind.

24:34.807 --> 24:38.777
The casino scene, with all
the lizards, the hitchhiker...

24:39.103 --> 24:43.231
I mean, those things just
have a life of their own,

24:43.232 --> 24:46.234
because they're accompanied
by all this literature with it

24:46.235 --> 24:49.821
and whole stories that
go with each illustration,

24:49.822 --> 24:54.075
or illustrations to
go with each story,

24:54.076 --> 24:57.170
depending on which
point of view you take.

25:01.959 --> 25:04.252
I wanted to get it
out of my system.

25:04.253 --> 25:08.214
It was something that was just
lying there waiting to erupt.

25:08.215 --> 25:10.433
So it was a bit like being sick.

25:14.888 --> 25:17.140
I threw the pictures down

25:17.141 --> 25:20.393
and they worked because they
were about something specific,

25:20.394 --> 25:24.939
but they allowed me a
complete freedom to do...

25:24.940 --> 25:26.737
it was as though I was there.

25:31.780 --> 25:34.123
Are we marking?

25:34.908 --> 25:40.163
Do you feel like your lack
of drug-taking ever affected,

25:40.164 --> 25:42.331
had an effect on your
relationship with Hunter?

25:42.332 --> 25:44.625
No, no, in fact, it
was better that way.

25:44.626 --> 25:47.378
It was better that we
were like chalk and cheese.

25:47.379 --> 25:52.476
I mean, the whole idea of me being
like him would have been ridiculous.

25:52.801 --> 25:55.053
Hunter, it's me!

25:55.054 --> 25:58.473
Because he was someone
entirely different.

25:58.474 --> 26:01.434
We didn't necessarily
see eye to eye.

26:01.435 --> 26:06.189
We had entirely different
experiences of life.

26:06.190 --> 26:11.947
And to him I was weird,
and to me he was weird.

26:12.738 --> 26:15.115
Nice to see you.

26:26.460 --> 26:28.962
Can I get some water?

26:30.422 --> 26:32.970
- Right, you ready?
- Okay.

26:34.968 --> 26:37.011
I like that.

26:37.012 --> 26:39.430
- Did you get that?
- Great.

26:39.431 --> 26:42.725
Oh, dear. I like that one.

26:42.726 --> 26:44.769
Well, this is cartridge paper.

26:44.770 --> 26:47.980
It's a good-quality, very
thick cartridge paper.

26:47.981 --> 26:51.234
And this is Indian ink.

26:51.902 --> 26:53.277
I like a brush...

26:53.278 --> 26:55.655
For that kind of a stroke,

26:55.656 --> 26:58.616
I couldn't have done it
with this one, for instance,

26:58.617 --> 27:01.744
which is less weight.

27:01.745 --> 27:05.414
But it might do
something, and it's lovely.

27:05.415 --> 27:07.633
I love it, what it does.

27:08.001 --> 27:09.710
And I might do
another one down there.

27:09.711 --> 27:14.090
And the way I flick, you just
simply have a flick of the wrist,

27:14.091 --> 27:17.811
which is a sort of a
proper semicircle, in a way.

27:18.220 --> 27:20.221
And then I've got
this here, you know,

27:20.222 --> 27:24.443
and I could take
some of this and go...

27:27.354 --> 27:31.654
Then I could, for instance...

27:34.987 --> 27:37.489
An eye in there.

27:37.698 --> 27:41.200
And I like the idea
of an eye in there

27:41.201 --> 27:46.252
and a sense of some face
that's happening there.

27:48.792 --> 27:53.138
And I blow like so.

27:57.384 --> 27:59.477
And things happen.

28:19.364 --> 28:20.956
What are you doing right now?

28:21.450 --> 28:26.421
Well, I'm pulling away the
gesso from underneath the color.

28:27.789 --> 28:32.043
I think perhaps, you know,
art is just tricks, really.

28:32.044 --> 28:34.503
In a way, I don't know
what there is there.

28:34.504 --> 28:36.672
I mean, it's only a...

28:36.673 --> 28:42.637
it started out as a blank sheet of
paper and it's become more than that.

28:42.638 --> 28:46.267
- There's an event going on in there.
- Yeah.

28:46.767 --> 28:49.269
That's rather nice.

28:50.812 --> 28:52.021
Take Francis Bacon.

28:52.022 --> 28:56.776
He always seemed to manage to make
his pictures look like an event,

28:56.777 --> 28:59.904
even though they
were not necessarily

28:59.905 --> 29:03.407
specifically of somebody.

29:03.408 --> 29:10.331
But he brought excitement into an area that
was apparently, at first glance, nothing.

29:10.332 --> 29:14.877
And I found that to be
pretty amazing, really.

29:14.878 --> 29:20.508
Do you make any use of preliminary
studies or sketches of any sort?

29:20.509 --> 29:22.009
Yes, I do.

29:22.010 --> 29:28.266
But after that, chance and
what I call accident takes over,

29:28.267 --> 29:33.938
when consciously I don't
know what I'm doing.

29:33.939 --> 29:36.190
At that moment,
I'm thinking of nothing

29:36.191 --> 29:40.987
but how hopeless and impossible
this thing is to achieve.

29:40.988 --> 29:46.117
Suddenly there comes something
which your instinct seizes on

29:46.118 --> 29:50.623
as being for a moment the thing
by which it could begin to develop.

29:57.504 --> 30:00.506
What that is, in fact, is stop-out.

30:00.507 --> 30:05.344
If I blow more color
over that, then I rub it,

30:05.345 --> 30:10.817
and it pulls this stuff off with the color
and leaves the paper still where it was.

30:11.601 --> 30:14.524
So I'll just do this.

30:17.983 --> 30:22.069
But also I'm worried about
going too far with that

30:22.070 --> 30:24.530
and completely losing it, you know.

30:24.531 --> 30:28.035
- Sure.
- I'd like to leave it for a bit, I think.

30:34.458 --> 30:40.546
The most enigmatic
and inquiring artist

30:40.547 --> 30:44.017
that ever lived would be Rembrandt,

30:45.510 --> 30:48.888
who took it upon himself to do

30:48.889 --> 30:51.265
self-portrait after self-portrait

30:51.266 --> 30:54.519
in the process of getting older.

30:56.938 --> 30:59.565
It was the most undecorative idea,

30:59.566 --> 31:01.817
taking yourself

31:01.818 --> 31:04.741
and watching yourself grow old,

31:05.739 --> 31:10.117
and give us an
animation of his aging

31:10.118 --> 31:15.044
in beautiful paintings,
great self-portraits.

31:16.416 --> 31:21.587
It was the most scintillating
intellectual exercise

31:21.588 --> 31:23.931
that one could imagine.

31:46.279 --> 31:47.947
Now what I'm gonna do is,

31:47.948 --> 31:52.618
'cause on there, there's all
this lovely masking fluid,

31:52.619 --> 31:54.495
and this is the only thing
that will take it off,

31:54.496 --> 31:57.374
which is masking fluid gone solid.

32:00.001 --> 32:02.128
What's underneath there?

32:02.129 --> 32:05.473
And this coming out now.
You're watching this?

32:08.885 --> 32:14.016
Some sort of substantial sort of

32:15.851 --> 32:20.857
place exists beyond the skyline.

32:22.858 --> 32:25.609
I find this funny, because even
amongst all the great details,

32:25.610 --> 32:29.488
there's precision in your work,
but you're still very, very playful.

32:29.489 --> 32:32.491
Well, it's 'cause I'm
not very professional.

32:32.492 --> 32:35.578
I don't go out of my
way to be professional.

32:35.579 --> 32:37.913
I go out of my way to
try and make something

32:37.914 --> 32:42.835
that is as unexpected to me as
it is to anyone else, you know?

32:42.836 --> 32:44.963
That's perfect.

32:50.719 --> 32:56.015
I think, most importantly, Picasso
has been the biggest influence of all,

32:56.016 --> 33:02.521
because of his continuing
persistent creative daily life.

33:02.522 --> 33:08.119
The way he made his life into the
reason for his living every day.

33:08.862 --> 33:12.907
And it gave me a purpose,
too, in a strange kind of way,

33:12.908 --> 33:15.743
and a sense of, "God, is there
anything on that piece of paper?"

33:15.744 --> 33:17.703
"Anything can be there."

33:17.704 --> 33:22.880
And Picasso proved it day
after day after day after day.

33:33.720 --> 33:38.265
He convinced me that
the thing I can do is

33:38.266 --> 33:41.268
simply start a drawing

33:41.269 --> 33:43.729
and it will come out
the other end somehow.

33:43.730 --> 33:46.524
And I won't know how it's
going to come out completely,

33:46.525 --> 33:49.443
but that's the fascination.

33:49.444 --> 33:52.788
That makes it a worthwhile pursuit.

33:54.574 --> 33:57.076
If I knew what was going
to happen before I started,

33:57.077 --> 33:59.955
what would be the
point of doing it?

34:01.748 --> 34:06.754
If you surprise yourself still,
you really could have a good trip.

34:36.491 --> 34:37.949
Well, the phone rang.

34:37.951 --> 34:40.911
"Ralph, this is Hunter."

34:40.911 --> 34:45.583
"So they seem to have liked
the Kentucky Derby piece

34:45.583 --> 34:47.960
"and they want us to do
something else, you know.

34:47.960 --> 34:51.088
"They want us to go to Zaire

34:51.089 --> 34:53.507
"and cover the Ali/Foreman fight,

34:53.507 --> 34:55.635
"the Rumble in the Jungle."

34:55.677 --> 34:59.397
So I said, "Yes, Hunter,
I think that would be very nice."

35:05.186 --> 35:08.939
I flew from London
and I arrived in Zaire,

35:08.940 --> 35:11.984
and the first thing I noticed
when I got off the plane

35:11.985 --> 35:13.532
was the blanket of heat.

35:26.625 --> 35:28.375
The first thing Hunter did

35:28.376 --> 35:30.711
was to go out and buy himself

35:30.712 --> 35:34.216
a massive bag of grass.

35:35.133 --> 35:39.012
And I thought to myself,
"I'm not gonna enjoy this."

35:46.895 --> 35:49.313
The phone rang and it was Hunter.

35:49.314 --> 35:52.107
"Ralph, got a great story.

35:52.108 --> 35:54.401
"Cover the America's
Cup in Rhode island."

35:54.402 --> 35:57.906
And I said, "Well,
I don't really like boats."

36:00.158 --> 36:01.659
So when we got there,

36:01.660 --> 36:05.790
the weather was so
bad, the race was off.

36:11.169 --> 36:13.922
I got a call from him.
"Ralph, this is Hunter here."

36:14.005 --> 36:16.678
"How do you feel about
doing another story?"

36:17.509 --> 36:19.802
Sorry. "Dr. Hunter S. Thompson,

36:19.803 --> 36:22.388
"care of General Delivery,
Woody Creek, Colorado,

36:22.389 --> 36:24.482
"It was May 23, 1980."

36:25.225 --> 36:26.266
"Dear Hunter,

36:26.267 --> 36:28.895
"we would like you to cover
the Honolulu Marathon."

36:29.062 --> 36:32.564
"We will pay all expenses
and an excellent fee."

36:32.565 --> 36:35.944
"Think about it. This is a
good chance for a vacation."

36:36.486 --> 36:38.329
Feels nice.

36:42.075 --> 36:43.867
And the idea was

36:43.868 --> 36:46.036
Hunter and I would
come out of the chocks,

36:46.037 --> 36:48.288
"shoulder to shoulder,"
as he put it, you know,

36:48.289 --> 36:53.465
and run as fast as hell,
obviously leaving people behind.

36:54.087 --> 36:58.308
And a truck would pick us up and
take us the rest of the way, you see.

37:00.844 --> 37:02.720
George Foreman,
I will bruise him up.

37:02.721 --> 37:05.347
If I don't knock him out,
I will cut him all up.

37:05.348 --> 37:08.067
Nicks and cuts all over his face.

37:09.185 --> 37:11.603
On the eighth floor of
the Intercontinental,

37:11.604 --> 37:14.903
George Foreman would
go walking with the dog.

37:22.490 --> 37:24.783
I came up with another idea.

37:24.784 --> 37:28.370
Why don't we go in
amongst the two boats,

37:28.371 --> 37:31.081
the Gretel and the Intrepid,

37:31.082 --> 37:34.793
and I write something, with a spray
can, on the side of one of the boats?

37:34.794 --> 37:37.087
He said, "What are you
gonna write, Ralph?"

37:37.088 --> 37:41.434
I said, "Well, I thought
of writing 'Fuck the Pope.'"

37:46.598 --> 37:50.559
And we waited for the people
who were by this time knackered.

37:50.560 --> 37:53.279
Then we'd be there to jeer.

37:55.190 --> 37:58.785
"Run, you bastard,
run!" we would shout.

37:59.694 --> 38:04.656
They went, "You filthy buggers!
No sportsmanship in you."

38:04.657 --> 38:07.826
We'd gone there to
screw the race up.

38:07.827 --> 38:09.661
It's an awful thing to do.

38:09.662 --> 38:13.757
I mean, this is the
mean face of Gonzo.

38:18.463 --> 38:22.968
Hunter said, "Are you ready
for this?" I said, "Yes."

38:23.718 --> 38:27.721
And you know when you take a
spray can, you have to shake it.

38:27.722 --> 38:29.723
And there's a little
ball, so you've got this,

38:29.724 --> 38:31.058
"Click, click, click..."

38:31.059 --> 38:34.812
I heard somebody say, "What
are you guys doing down there?"

38:34.813 --> 38:37.105
And Hunter said, "God, pigs."

38:37.106 --> 38:39.817
"We've failed. We must flee."

38:39.818 --> 38:42.903
And he brought out Leary flares,

38:42.904 --> 38:46.865
which you only use in times of
distress in the middle of an ocean,

38:46.866 --> 38:50.077
which he set off in the harbor,

38:50.078 --> 38:54.879
and some of them fell onto
boats and that caused mayhem.

39:03.675 --> 39:06.218
I said to Hunter, "When
are we going to the fight?"

39:06.219 --> 39:10.064
"We're not, Ralph.
I sold the tickets." "What?"

39:11.015 --> 39:14.852
He went down to the pool,
threw the grass into the pool

39:14.853 --> 39:17.401
and dived straight into it.

39:19.440 --> 39:20.816
We couldn't go and see the fight.

39:20.817 --> 39:23.777
The only way I could go and
see it was on television,

39:23.778 --> 39:25.871
which I did in the bar.

39:30.577 --> 39:31.952
The moment the fight was over,

39:31.953 --> 39:35.998
everybody just wanted
to get out of Zaire.

39:35.999 --> 39:38.843
"We must get out of
here. We must flee."

39:44.340 --> 39:46.466
It's a good way to do
stuff, for no good reason.

39:46.467 --> 39:47.885
Another of Hunter's phrases.

39:47.886 --> 39:52.812
"Why are we doing this, Hunter?"
"For no good reason, Ralph."

39:56.311 --> 39:58.395
What I seem to have become

39:58.396 --> 40:04.494
is a kind of visual
chronicler of a part of Hunter.

40:04.903 --> 40:07.279
I had personified him.

40:07.280 --> 40:10.449
That was like a comic character.

40:10.450 --> 40:15.037
He'd got a cigarette holder. Had to
have it. It was part of the outfit.

40:15.038 --> 40:19.884
And he had all those things
and I gave them all to him.

40:26.341 --> 40:28.216
'Cause he didn't like the idea

40:28.217 --> 40:33.513
that anyone was going
to outwit him in any way,

40:33.514 --> 40:35.557
you know, that he would...

40:35.558 --> 40:40.063
He's in charge. He's the
writer. I'm just an artist.

40:40.188 --> 40:41.480
I'm Edward.

40:41.481 --> 40:44.566
He has a bird called Edward,
such a marvelous character...

40:44.567 --> 40:46.026
I think Hunter tormented it,

40:46.027 --> 40:48.528
but I think there was a
kind of two-way affection

40:48.529 --> 40:49.655
or something going on.

40:49.656 --> 40:52.454
Edward, talk to me. No?

40:52.825 --> 40:55.786
Hunter would use it, I think,
to bounce off, you know.

40:55.787 --> 40:57.621
He'd use it as a kind
of victim, you know,

40:57.622 --> 41:02.376
something to bring into the story
and how he was feeling about it,

41:02.377 --> 41:03.460
who was the bird.

41:03.461 --> 41:07.386
I suppose at some point I, in a
way, became the bird, you know.

41:13.346 --> 41:15.393
Now.

41:15.765 --> 41:19.485
Now we're going to talk,
Edward. Speak to me. Yes.

41:21.771 --> 41:24.064
I feel like Edward
sometimes, in a situation,

41:24.065 --> 41:26.733
I feel absolutely taken apart,

41:26.734 --> 41:30.028
as though he's had a whole
session of talking to me, you know,

41:30.029 --> 41:33.658
holding me like a bird and I'm
trying to bite my way out of it.

41:34.283 --> 41:36.877
And that was our
relationship, actually.

41:38.955 --> 41:42.959
It was ill-treatment,
you know, that he gave me.

41:44.836 --> 41:47.796
Speak up, Edward, speak
up. Speak up! Talk to me!

41:47.797 --> 41:51.508
He could be an absolute
son of a bitch, you know,

41:51.509 --> 41:58.358
and left me sometimes
in a right state.

43:53.381 --> 43:55.966
The basis of Ralph
and Hunter's friendship

43:55.967 --> 43:59.803
was that they saw kindred
spirits in each other.

43:59.804 --> 44:02.430
I think that the
difference was that

44:02.431 --> 44:06.606
Hunter realized that
Ralph was crazier than him.

44:07.311 --> 44:10.438
Ralph was willing to go to extremes
that Hunter was not willing to,

44:10.439 --> 44:13.775
and you'd think Hunter would be
the one who was the, you know,

44:13.776 --> 44:15.569
more outrageous and reckless

44:15.570 --> 44:17.946
and the one who would go
out on a limb on something.

44:17.947 --> 44:19.406
But Ralph was the one
who'd actually go there.

44:19.407 --> 44:21.825
I'm not talking
about physical safety.

44:21.826 --> 44:25.495
But I'm talking about
sort of, you know,

44:25.496 --> 44:30.792
mental, moral, philosophical,

44:30.793 --> 44:33.216
take a chance with your own work.

44:54.025 --> 44:56.484
I think America is where

44:56.485 --> 45:00.831
all that was going wrong in
the world was being nurtured.

45:04.118 --> 45:06.661
Blast the hell out
of North Vietnam...

45:06.662 --> 45:08.205
- Do you agree?
- Absolutely.

45:08.206 --> 45:13.543
If anything, before the election,
we're gonna bomb more, believe me.

45:13.544 --> 45:16.004
It seemed to me they
needed attacking.

45:16.005 --> 45:20.050
It was something that
absolutely had to be done.

45:20.051 --> 45:25.347
So it had fallen to me to do this.

45:25.348 --> 45:28.558
It was my duty to change the world.

45:28.559 --> 45:31.311
I'd always thought I
wanted to change the world.

45:31.312 --> 45:33.780
Now was the moment.

45:47.119 --> 45:50.664
Ralph was willing to say
anything about anybody.

45:50.665 --> 45:53.875
I mean, his moral
sensibility was affronted

45:53.876 --> 45:57.175
and he would just say
so, he wouldn't stop.

45:57.964 --> 46:01.513
And thus in a certain sense insane,

46:02.218 --> 46:06.179
willing to, you know, go to the
limits of what was appropriate,

46:06.180 --> 46:08.598
beyond the limits of what was
appropriate and what was sanity,

46:08.599 --> 46:10.225
and dangerous in that way.

46:14.105 --> 46:18.191
Because people have gotta know whether
or not their president's a crook.

46:18.192 --> 46:19.989
Well, I'm not a crook.

46:23.447 --> 46:28.994
I had found my voice and I
wasn't at all afraid anymore.

46:28.995 --> 46:33.375
I was going to use it as a weapon.

46:52.143 --> 46:55.145
One continually lives in hope

46:55.146 --> 46:59.691
and that you are coming along as
a sort of knight in shining armor

46:59.692 --> 47:01.776
and you're going to do your best.

47:01.777 --> 47:04.904
In a way, you're being
rather self-righteous.

47:04.905 --> 47:09.409
But be proud of the fact that
you are attempting to put right

47:09.410 --> 47:11.912
what really is wrong.

47:23.215 --> 47:25.759
Since then Steadman
has gone back and forth,

47:25.760 --> 47:28.928
contributing regularly to the
pages of Rolling Stone magazine,

47:28.929 --> 47:31.389
recording some of the
significant political events

47:31.390 --> 47:33.475
and personalities of American life.

47:33.476 --> 47:35.060
His output is prolific.

47:35.061 --> 47:39.031
He even writes Rolling Stone's
occasional gardening column.

47:39.732 --> 47:41.775
Yeah, I wanted to write.

47:41.776 --> 47:43.485
Really?

47:43.486 --> 47:47.614
And having Hunter saying
to me, "Don't write, Ralph.

47:47.615 --> 47:50.742
"You'll bring shame
on your family."

47:50.743 --> 47:54.247
That spurred me on and I
thought, "No, bugger you."

47:57.208 --> 48:01.838
She's my love

48:03.089 --> 48:07.509
She's my life

48:07.510 --> 48:12.639
It's really such a pity that
she's someone else's wife

48:12.640 --> 48:16.940
She's my love...

48:18.979 --> 48:22.107
Thank you for ringing.
I'm not here at the moment.

48:22.108 --> 48:28.331
I'm busy writing a book and
I'll ring you later. Thanks.

48:51.512 --> 48:54.597
I need a couple of drinks, actually,
to start on this, really do.

48:54.598 --> 48:56.641
What is the time now, by the way?

48:56.642 --> 48:58.314
- 12:00.
- Right.

49:02.314 --> 49:05.900
The task I set myself was
filled with such challenge

49:05.901 --> 49:09.279
that I feared the very
touching of the wall.

49:09.280 --> 49:12.365
At times I was overcome
with desperate fear

49:12.366 --> 49:16.621
and dared not mar the
whiteness there before me.

49:23.043 --> 49:27.589
And I began to paint upon the
wall itself on 6th June, 1505,

49:27.590 --> 49:30.889
at the stroke of the 13th hour.

49:30.968 --> 49:34.012
At the moment of putting
the brush upon the wall,

49:34.013 --> 49:38.563
the skies darkened and
the bells started to toll.

49:40.394 --> 49:43.354
Leonardo da Vinci was a genius.

49:43.355 --> 49:46.441
In fact, Sigmund Freud said

49:46.442 --> 49:49.240
he was the man who
woke up in the dark.

49:53.365 --> 49:56.784
I thought, "Am I knowledgeable
enough to know anything

49:56.785 --> 49:59.662
"about such a man as
Leonardo da Vinci?"

49:59.663 --> 50:01.915
There must be loads
of people around

50:01.916 --> 50:04.209
who have done books
about Leonardo da Vinci.

50:04.210 --> 50:08.838
And I found there were more than most
people have ever been written about.

50:08.839 --> 50:14.095
So how can I possibly write
a book that was different?

50:14.762 --> 50:16.930
How many books have
you read about Leonardo?

50:16.931 --> 50:19.307
I suppose I've been
through about 50,

50:19.308 --> 50:24.564
and I'm none the wiser.
I don't know a damn thing.

50:26.357 --> 50:28.691
About halfway through
I suddenly thought,

50:28.692 --> 50:31.903
"What if I call
myself 'I, Leonardo'?"

50:31.904 --> 50:34.406
And so I became Leonardo.

50:37.660 --> 50:40.663
It was 16th of December, 1982.

50:41.580 --> 50:44.799
The angle for my book
on Leonardo da Vinci.

50:45.000 --> 50:48.379
I would write it
in the first person.

50:48.671 --> 50:51.890
I would look through his eyes.

50:52.132 --> 50:55.176
Only I will know what it felt like.

50:55.177 --> 50:57.600
No experts can tell me.

51:01.308 --> 51:03.643
This allows me artistic license

51:03.644 --> 51:07.855
and affords me the luxury
of telling my life story

51:07.856 --> 51:12.827
without all the doubt that
accompanies most biographies about me.

51:25.165 --> 51:28.543
The reason I chose
Leonardo as a subject

51:28.544 --> 51:31.754
was because of something he said,

51:31.755 --> 51:35.304
that genius was the
capacity for taking pains.

51:37.720 --> 51:42.765
In a way I recognized
something of me in him,

51:42.766 --> 51:49.649
that I was trying hard to
be something rather special.

51:49.815 --> 51:52.275
And that's not swanky-ing about it.

51:52.276 --> 51:58.829
It's just trying to do something
as definitively as I possibly could

51:58.866 --> 52:03.121
that served the purpose
it was intended to serve.

52:08.876 --> 52:13.046
He was fascinated
by why things worked

52:13.047 --> 52:15.506
and how interrelated they all were.

52:15.507 --> 52:20.888
Everything that he
designed and invented

52:21.055 --> 52:26.061
were the result of
thinking about life itself.

52:28.103 --> 52:32.273
I think the most significant
thing that Leonardo did,

52:32.274 --> 52:34.233
that makes him so special,

52:34.234 --> 52:39.072
was that he came out with something that
probably other people had dreamed of,

52:39.073 --> 52:42.042
and that was how to fly.

52:45.162 --> 52:47.664
I devised a simple flying harness

52:47.665 --> 52:51.876
whereby myself, or someone who
might fit the harness willingly,

52:51.877 --> 52:55.472
would soar out from some eminence.

53:05.891 --> 53:09.060
The parachute invented by Leonardo

53:09.061 --> 53:13.031
would have been, you know, a
triangular... Like a pyramid.

53:29.581 --> 53:34.177
But then he came out with a
cleverer idea, which was the glider.

53:40.801 --> 53:42.218
It flies,

53:42.219 --> 53:44.392
but I don't.

53:51.437 --> 53:55.106
You know, I learned a lot from
him. I learned a lot from...

53:55.107 --> 53:56.566
This is how I got an education.

53:56.567 --> 54:01.413
I didn't have an education
before I started doing stuff.

54:02.823 --> 54:06.367
And, you know, I mean,
I left school with zilch.

54:06.368 --> 54:08.165
Yeah.

54:27.514 --> 54:29.640
I went to Abergele Grammar School.

54:29.641 --> 54:33.020
The headmaster's
name was D.B. Jones.

54:35.022 --> 54:38.617
He was such a sweet, gentle man.

54:40.277 --> 54:45.865
After D.B. Jones retired,
we got a new headmaster,

54:45.866 --> 54:48.201
Dr. Hubert Hughes.

54:48.202 --> 54:52.789
He took over and authority
became very important for him,

54:52.790 --> 54:55.292
and caning boys.

55:02.382 --> 55:07.386
My head is down because,
in a peculiar way,

55:07.387 --> 55:10.807
I felt that school was in some ways

55:10.808 --> 55:14.519
a rather authoritative process.

55:14.520 --> 55:17.104
And that's when I coined
a phrase which was,

55:17.105 --> 55:20.324
"Authority is the
mask of violence."

55:27.074 --> 55:29.492
I can't stand bullies,

55:29.493 --> 55:31.244
and there have been so many of them

55:31.245 --> 55:33.663
and they've been always
in positions of power.

55:33.664 --> 55:37.759
I'm afraid I find that
frankly unforgivable.

55:40.003 --> 55:45.424
The desire to shock is also a
way of getting back at authority.

55:45.425 --> 55:48.724
That idea that,
"Righto, you owe me."

55:48.804 --> 55:52.890
You scared the living
daylights out of me as a kid

55:52.891 --> 55:58.062
with your awful way of dealing
with children and school.

55:58.063 --> 56:04.366
I was trying to hurt the thing
that hurt me, if you like.

56:07.698 --> 56:14.620
It's the key to opening the
door into my dark spirit inside

56:14.621 --> 56:16.163
and out comes

56:16.164 --> 56:19.458
the drawing that some
people call vicious

56:19.459 --> 56:23.296
and all sorts of other
names, or perceptive even.

56:23.297 --> 56:24.889
Sure.

56:25.132 --> 56:28.718
It's like a filter
somewhere inside me

56:28.719 --> 56:32.346
that lets it through
and onto paper,

56:32.347 --> 56:35.316
and the anger is expressed.

56:35.434 --> 56:38.352
It doesn't matter that
I'm pleasant one minute

56:38.353 --> 56:41.564
and then I'm suddenly
vitriolic the next.

56:41.565 --> 56:44.363
They go together. It's perfect.

57:17.643 --> 57:20.353
Well, this is a little
booklet I put together

57:20.354 --> 57:22.730
to celebrate the 50th anniversary

57:22.731 --> 57:28.362
of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights.

57:29.029 --> 57:32.624
And so it's introduced
and illustrated by me.

57:35.160 --> 57:36.869
Article 1.

57:36.870 --> 57:40.706
All human beings are born free
and equal in dignity and rights.

57:40.707 --> 57:43.209
They are endowed with
reason and conscience

57:43.210 --> 57:47.546
and should act towards one
another in a spirit of brotherhood.

57:47.547 --> 57:49.507
Article 2.

57:49.508 --> 57:52.426
Everyone is entitled to
all the rights and freedoms

57:52.427 --> 57:54.512
set forth in this declaration.

57:54.513 --> 57:56.138
Article 3.

57:56.139 --> 58:00.815
Everyone has the right to life,
liberty and security of person.

58:00.894 --> 58:05.106
Article 4. No one shall be
held in slavery or servitude.

58:05.107 --> 58:09.694
Article 5. No one shall be
subject to torture or cruel...

58:09.695 --> 58:14.281
Article 6. Everyone has the
right to recognition everywhere

58:14.282 --> 58:17.660
as a person before the law.

58:17.661 --> 58:19.412
Article 7.

58:19.413 --> 58:21.080
All are equal before the law

58:21.081 --> 58:23.916
and are entitled without
any discrimination...

58:23.917 --> 58:29.296
Nothing in this declaration may be
interpreted as implying for any state,

58:29.297 --> 58:33.968
any right to engage in any
activity or to perform any act

58:33.969 --> 58:36.187
aimed at the destruction...

58:58.994 --> 59:04.373
People actually had the
balls, had the foresight,

59:04.374 --> 59:07.460
had the understanding
of human nature,

59:07.461 --> 59:12.131
to say, "We don't just talk
about it. We write it down."

59:12.132 --> 59:16.978
Then we remind ourselves
of what human rights are.

59:26.063 --> 59:28.773
What I'll try to do is draw things

59:28.774 --> 59:33.527
because I'm angry at these people
who are cheated and swindled.

59:33.528 --> 59:37.749
That's who my enemy
is. That's my object,

59:37.783 --> 59:41.583
the object of my protest.

59:44.539 --> 59:47.833
I just wanted to be taken seriously

59:47.834 --> 59:53.215
as an artist who was
doing serious cartoons.

01:00:00.555 --> 01:00:02.272
The age of miracles.

01:00:02.474 --> 01:00:06.685
A pocket-sized, folding,
electronically controlled,

01:00:06.686 --> 01:00:09.522
motor-driven,
single-lens reflex camera

01:00:09.523 --> 01:00:11.899
that quite simply
does the impossible.

01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:13.609
Come a bit closer.

01:00:13.610 --> 01:00:17.865
Focus. Train.

01:00:18.073 --> 01:00:20.658
Touch the electric button...

01:00:20.659 --> 01:00:22.627
And the impossible happens.

01:00:24.496 --> 01:00:29.251
In minutes, you have a finished
photograph of dazzling beauty.

01:00:32.671 --> 01:00:38.644
That is the Polaroid
SX-70 experience.

01:00:39.553 --> 01:00:41.100
Yeah, that's better.

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:43.682
- Ready?
- Yeah.

01:00:45.433 --> 01:00:48.310
- It worked.
- There's no film in it.

01:00:48.311 --> 01:00:50.233
I wanna do it again.

01:00:57.529 --> 01:01:00.865
In 1996, I published With Nails,

01:01:00.866 --> 01:01:03.325
which was a compilation
of film diaries,

01:01:03.326 --> 01:01:06.078
and I wanted

01:01:06.079 --> 01:01:09.415
the fly covers on the inside of
the book, the back and the front.

01:01:09.416 --> 01:01:14.420
I thought it'd be a good idea as
Ralph was so emblematic to Withnail.

01:01:14.421 --> 01:01:17.923
I asked Ralph if he could come
up with a drawing or some idea.

01:01:17.924 --> 01:01:22.270
And he said, "Come down
and we'll do paranoids."

01:01:40.405 --> 01:01:42.281
He took pictures of
well-known people,

01:01:42.282 --> 01:01:45.326
or characters like Bela
Lugosi or John Travolta,

01:01:45.327 --> 01:01:47.625
and then would stick
them on my face.

01:01:49.372 --> 01:01:50.748
- That one worked.
- Yeah.

01:01:50.749 --> 01:01:52.917
Okay, we're onto something now.

01:01:52.918 --> 01:01:55.586
Now, let me play with
these ones for a minute.

01:01:55.587 --> 01:01:58.714
And then work on the Polaroid
when it was still warm

01:01:58.715 --> 01:02:02.389
and fiddle around so that the
two images melded together.

01:02:06.723 --> 01:02:08.724
They're directly on the...

01:02:08.725 --> 01:02:11.936
- Done onto the film.
- Onto the film.

01:02:11.937 --> 01:02:14.521
While it's still...
While it's still...

01:02:14.522 --> 01:02:19.735
I was after getting the real person
and then doing something to it.

01:02:19.736 --> 01:02:23.197
I was actually trying to get
a good picture of somebody,

01:02:23.198 --> 01:02:25.032
then distorting it,

01:02:25.033 --> 01:02:27.956
to look like one of my drawings.

01:02:31.998 --> 01:02:34.541
It was the essence of my work

01:02:34.542 --> 01:02:40.549
to distort and yet
maintain the likeness.

01:02:46.137 --> 01:02:50.224
I thought, this is great, so I
just fiddled with each one I did,

01:02:50.225 --> 01:02:56.021
and made that happen, made
them move in an expressive way.

01:02:56.022 --> 01:03:00.025
And I thought, "Well, that speaks
to me as my kind of drawing."

01:03:00.026 --> 01:03:02.324
That's what I like, you know.

01:03:02.529 --> 01:03:09.412
So I started doing them of
the Queen and Princess Di.

01:03:10.829 --> 01:03:15.040
And that was Fergie, which I
thought, "That's coming out well."

01:03:15.041 --> 01:03:18.002
And I thought, "I've
got a book here."

01:03:18.003 --> 01:03:19.971
So I did a book of it.

01:03:42.861 --> 01:03:44.820
Anyway, they all
came out like that,

01:03:44.821 --> 01:03:47.574
and there was one,
and it's this one.

01:03:48.033 --> 01:03:52.870
We were at the
Jerome Hotel in Aspen,

01:03:52.871 --> 01:03:54.913
and there was a sort of reception

01:03:54.914 --> 01:03:58.667
and David Hockney had
been invited as well.

01:03:58.668 --> 01:04:01.795
And then I saw David in the bar.

01:04:01.796 --> 01:04:04.214
So I went up behind him,

01:04:04.215 --> 01:04:08.677
had the camera ready,
and I said, "David."

01:04:08.678 --> 01:04:11.055
And he turned round like
that and I went "Click, bash!"

01:04:11.056 --> 01:04:13.349
And the thing hit him, you see.

01:04:13.350 --> 01:04:16.148
And he said, "It won't
come out, you know."

01:04:16.436 --> 01:04:18.937
Goddamn know-all.

01:04:18.938 --> 01:04:21.816
It came out as one
of the best, actually.

01:04:24.486 --> 01:04:26.488
Can I pick it up?

01:04:33.870 --> 01:04:35.622
Does this sound distorted to you?

01:04:37.832 --> 01:04:39.041
Okeydoke.

01:04:39.042 --> 01:04:41.293
The war file...

01:04:41.294 --> 01:04:43.545
One more time. Sorry, Ralph.

01:04:43.546 --> 01:04:48.017
The war file, 1963, 2003.

01:04:49.427 --> 01:04:55.057
I protest, I protest, I protest,
I protest vehemently against the war.

01:04:55.058 --> 01:04:57.267
I protest vehemently
against the war.

01:04:57.268 --> 01:05:01.313
I'm seeking out every drawing
I've done since the '60s,

01:05:01.314 --> 01:05:05.526
which in one way or another displays
the irony of our crass stupidity.

01:05:05.527 --> 01:05:08.445
I will miss some things.
There are so many.

01:05:08.446 --> 01:05:10.197
I know nothing will be solved,

01:05:10.198 --> 01:05:13.542
but I do it for my
sanity and world peace.

01:05:14.577 --> 01:05:19.002
Our leaders are mindless,
arrogant and insane.

01:05:35.098 --> 01:05:40.144
The thing about Ralph's work is
it was just the energy, the anger,

01:05:40.145 --> 01:05:42.521
the venom that was just spewed out,

01:05:42.522 --> 01:05:45.024
and that's what I loved.

01:05:53.283 --> 01:05:57.953
I wish I'd had that kind of
ability to explode like Ralph does

01:05:57.954 --> 01:06:00.752
and still control
it at the same time.

01:06:09.549 --> 01:06:12.509
The problem with protest
is we were the protesters

01:06:12.510 --> 01:06:15.012
and we got old and we got tired.

01:06:15.013 --> 01:06:18.140
We screamed and shouted and we did
change the world to some degree,

01:06:18.141 --> 01:06:19.641
but not as much as we'd like.

01:06:19.642 --> 01:06:23.896
And that leads to depression and
a sort of sense of semi-impotence,

01:06:23.897 --> 01:06:26.482
which I think after a while
begins to just wear you down.

01:06:26.483 --> 01:06:29.401
You realize that you
did make these changes

01:06:29.402 --> 01:06:32.154
and you see a new generation
of people coming up

01:06:32.155 --> 01:06:37.326
who are the beneficiaries of
a lot of the noise we made,

01:06:37.327 --> 01:06:40.704
and they don't give a damn,
they don't give a toss.

01:06:40.705 --> 01:06:42.039
They're into shopping.

01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:45.009
So it gets very hard to
know what to do with this.

01:06:47.253 --> 01:06:50.506
Ralph can't stop.
I don't think I can stop.

01:06:50.507 --> 01:06:54.176
We'll go to our graves shouting
and screaming and making noise

01:06:54.177 --> 01:06:56.679
and nobody will listen.

01:07:03.603 --> 01:07:07.064
To John Dillinger and I
hope he is still alive.

01:07:07.065 --> 01:07:12.662
Thanksgiving Day,
November 28th, 1986.

01:07:14.447 --> 01:07:17.991
Thanks for the wild turkey
and the passenger pigeons

01:07:17.992 --> 01:07:19.743
destined to be shit out

01:07:19.744 --> 01:07:23.589
through wholesome American guts.

01:07:25.250 --> 01:07:29.380
Thanks for a continent
to despoil and poison.

01:07:31.256 --> 01:07:37.229
Thanks for Indians to provide a
modicum of challenge and danger.

01:07:38.930 --> 01:07:43.976
Thanks for vast herds of
bison to kill and skin,

01:07:43.977 --> 01:07:47.105
leaving the carcasses to rot.

01:07:49.816 --> 01:07:54.162
Thanks for bounties
on wolves and coyotes.

01:07:57.156 --> 01:08:01.326
Thanks for the American Dream
to vulgarize and falsify.

01:08:01.327 --> 01:08:04.913
Like 1987, '88, around then,

01:08:04.914 --> 01:08:10.252
I was asked to do these
records with William Burroughs,

01:08:10.253 --> 01:08:16.430
and that was so connected to
the world of Hunter and Ralph.

01:08:16.718 --> 01:08:19.845
And, of course, Ralph
adored this when he heard it.

01:08:19.845 --> 01:08:22.849
He liked the beginning
and the montage.

01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:27.319
You know, it was all
these worlds meeting.

01:08:28.104 --> 01:08:31.573
Thanks for "Kill a Queer
for Christ" stickers.

01:08:32.524 --> 01:08:36.029
Thanks for laboratory AIDS.

01:08:38.156 --> 01:08:42.911
Thanks for prohibition
and the war against drugs.

01:08:44.828 --> 01:08:50.836
Thanks for a country where nobody
is allowed to mind his own business.

01:08:51.669 --> 01:08:55.343
Thanks for a nation of finks.

01:08:55.881 --> 01:09:00.176
Yes, thanks for all the memories.

01:09:00.178 --> 01:09:03.596
All right, let's see your arms.

01:09:03.598 --> 01:09:06.265
You always were a headache

01:09:06.267 --> 01:09:09.441
and you always were a bore.

01:09:10.897 --> 01:09:14.066
Thanks for the last
and greatest betrayal

01:09:14.067 --> 01:09:18.822
of the last and
greatest of human dreams.

01:09:22.950 --> 01:09:27.912
'Cause that type of writing,
that type of drawing,

01:09:27.913 --> 01:09:29.831
is very admirable to me,

01:09:29.832 --> 01:09:33.502
'cause in an odd way it's what we're
thinking at the back of our heads

01:09:33.502 --> 01:09:36.129
but aren't capable
of getting it out.

01:09:36.130 --> 01:09:39.758
These guys have the
kind of minds that

01:09:39.759 --> 01:09:42.594
that comes out of them.

01:09:42.595 --> 01:09:45.805
I mean, look at Ralph as a person.

01:09:45.807 --> 01:09:49.309
You never met a warmer, generous...

01:09:49.310 --> 01:09:52.609
He is not his paintings.

01:09:55.942 --> 01:09:57.150
I don't know.

01:09:57.151 --> 01:10:00.904
- Everything's here except the guns.
- Guns?

01:10:00.905 --> 01:10:03.240
Everything's here except the guns.

01:10:03.241 --> 01:10:05.960
- He can hardly walk.
- Yeah.

01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:09.622
They must be in the car.

01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:16.294
We found a spot where he does
his shooting. He likes to shoot.

01:10:16.295 --> 01:10:19.005
And that's where we
set up the target.

01:10:19.006 --> 01:10:20.716
Six.

01:10:20.717 --> 01:10:23.510
When it stays open,
it's empty, see?

01:10:23.511 --> 01:10:25.137
Yeah. Right.

01:10:25.138 --> 01:10:26.596
- Understand?
- Yes.

01:10:26.597 --> 01:10:29.099
- Okay.
- Just about.

01:10:41.362 --> 01:10:43.864
So he comes forward

01:10:43.865 --> 01:10:46.658
and he was quite trembly
by this time and...

01:10:46.659 --> 01:10:49.745
Two, three, four,

01:10:49.746 --> 01:10:52.840
five, six, seven.

01:10:56.043 --> 01:10:57.715
Here I go.

01:11:02.008 --> 01:11:04.510
And he goes...

01:11:08.598 --> 01:11:12.318
Empties six rounds,
you see, like that.

01:11:13.770 --> 01:11:16.021
There, you cut his head off.

01:11:16.022 --> 01:11:20.108
I said, "Well, William,
you've missed," you know.

01:11:20.109 --> 01:11:24.409
They all went through his
neck, you see. So he said...

01:11:27.450 --> 01:11:29.952
He's dead, man.

01:11:33.790 --> 01:11:35.290
One of the privileges

01:11:35.291 --> 01:11:39.878
working with Hunter and
William Burroughs was

01:11:39.879 --> 01:11:42.631
they were perverse in many ways

01:11:42.632 --> 01:11:46.261
and yet incredibly honest.

01:11:47.178 --> 01:11:49.763
I think what attracted me to them

01:11:49.764 --> 01:11:53.099
was the fact that they
were honest writers,

01:11:53.100 --> 01:11:55.185
writing about real things

01:11:55.186 --> 01:11:57.521
that they actually experienced.

01:11:57.522 --> 01:12:03.819
So in some ways one would say
they were journalist-writers.

01:12:03.820 --> 01:12:07.449
- They wrote about what happened to them.
- Yeah.

01:12:09.033 --> 01:12:11.451
Isn't it awful? It's awful.

01:12:11.452 --> 01:12:15.747
And look how I look, as though
I'm, you know, in control.

01:12:15.748 --> 01:12:17.582
- Exactly.
- And I'm not.

01:12:17.583 --> 01:12:20.210
How many copies of this got out?

01:12:20.211 --> 01:12:22.713
About four million.

01:12:24.298 --> 01:12:26.508
No, no, no, no, no.

01:12:26.509 --> 01:12:29.845
Christ, he always puts me
down in this terrible way.

01:12:29.846 --> 01:12:32.690
I'm shutting this off for a
minute 'cause I'm pissed off.

01:12:34.392 --> 01:12:39.479
So, Ralph, was that the last
time you saw Hunter, at Owl Farm?

01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:44.276
Yes, that was the last time.
That was... That was October...

01:12:44.277 --> 01:12:48.702
September, October, 2004.

01:12:58.165 --> 01:13:00.417
I had one blowup today
in my pants, and this is

01:13:00.418 --> 01:13:01.626
- another blowup!
- Stop it. Stop it.

01:13:01.627 --> 01:13:03.379
- So you keep doing it...
- Stop it!

01:13:03.713 --> 01:13:05.755
- Don't do that.
- Please don't shout about it.

01:13:05.756 --> 01:13:07.799
I don't come into your house and
copy all your fucking drawings

01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:09.634
and then take them out
and run away with me, do I?

01:13:09.635 --> 01:13:10.969
I'm not doing that.

01:13:10.970 --> 01:13:15.307
Go on! Fucking well do
something, for Christ's sake!

01:13:15.308 --> 01:13:18.937
You miserable son of a bitch.
What the hell are you trying to do?

01:13:22.899 --> 01:13:26.109
Sitting here in this goddamn place!

01:13:26.110 --> 01:13:28.578
I think Ralph loved Hunter

01:13:28.905 --> 01:13:33.408
and was hoping that Hunter would
be something he couldn't be,

01:13:33.409 --> 01:13:36.578
a little more responsible
and a little more careful

01:13:36.579 --> 01:13:38.456
and a little more generous.

01:13:44.253 --> 01:13:47.839
Day one. The English
artist Ralph Steadman

01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:50.675
sets off with a BBC film
crew for Aspen, Colorado,

01:13:50.676 --> 01:13:52.010
to meet an old friend.

01:13:52.011 --> 01:13:54.471
The intermingling of the
commentary was so great.

01:13:54.472 --> 01:13:56.514
It was like, you
know, jealous brothers,

01:13:56.515 --> 01:13:59.643
or partners like Keith and
Mick or something like that,

01:13:59.644 --> 01:14:03.523
that just, you know,
was gonna blow apart.

01:14:05.399 --> 01:14:09.653
What I had presented myself as

01:14:09.654 --> 01:14:12.072
was a ready answer
to all your problems.

01:14:12.073 --> 01:14:15.450
And I took it quite readily, and
that's why you illustrated the book.

01:14:15.451 --> 01:14:19.162
It wasn't the only reason,
Hunter. It wasn't the only reason.

01:14:19.163 --> 01:14:23.083
No one would have noticed it had
it not been for my illustrations.

01:14:23.084 --> 01:14:24.626
No one.

01:14:24.627 --> 01:14:26.461
What you're saying, Ralph, is that

01:14:26.462 --> 01:14:30.382
Fear and Loathing in Las
Vegas would not have been a...

01:14:30.383 --> 01:14:31.758
The success it was.

01:14:31.759 --> 01:14:34.344
A success if it hadn't
been illustrated by you?

01:14:34.345 --> 01:14:37.138
Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.

01:14:37.139 --> 01:14:39.349
Yeah, that's the story, in fact.

01:14:39.350 --> 01:14:42.936
The story that was never told
was the story of my resentment,

01:14:42.937 --> 01:14:46.731
- my burning desperate resentment.
- That explains a lot, doesn't it?

01:14:46.732 --> 01:14:48.324
Yeah.

01:14:50.903 --> 01:14:53.196
I think in Hunter's
heart, he loved Ralph.

01:14:53.197 --> 01:14:55.665
Ralph was a brother to Hunter.

01:14:55.825 --> 01:14:58.702
And they were two
wonderful characters

01:14:58.703 --> 01:15:01.621
and they had a great
collaboration and friendship.

01:15:01.622 --> 01:15:05.291
But sometimes those
things tend to break apart,

01:15:05.292 --> 01:15:07.752
especially when you've
got irascible personalities

01:15:07.753 --> 01:15:11.047
and particularly when
you have, you know,

01:15:11.048 --> 01:15:15.598
Hunter's, you know, problem
with drink and drugs.

01:15:17.388 --> 01:15:20.983
- You don't care?
- I do care, actually.

01:15:21.308 --> 01:15:27.397
You know that, Hunter, but it's been a
fucking hard ride for all sorts of reasons.

01:15:27.398 --> 01:15:30.651
- Who do you wanna beat on?
- For fuck's sake.

01:15:31.986 --> 01:15:36.406
Hang on. I'm gonna stop this thing now,
'cause I can't talk to you like this.

01:15:36.407 --> 01:15:38.575
- Yeah, you get out of here.
- What?

01:15:38.576 --> 01:15:41.750
- I'm starting to feel queer.
- Christ.

01:15:48.127 --> 01:15:50.795
He just realized this
was the death of fun.

01:15:50.796 --> 01:15:53.298
There was no more fun.

01:15:57.261 --> 01:15:59.763
And the idea of going
into an old people's home,

01:15:59.764 --> 01:16:02.390
Hunter S. Thompson in
an old people's home,

01:16:02.391 --> 01:16:04.313
can you imagine?

01:16:08.898 --> 01:16:11.566
And he said, "I can't
bear the idea, Ralph.

01:16:11.567 --> 01:16:14.819
"I've got this awful
image in my mind of

01:16:14.820 --> 01:16:18.615
"me sitting there strapped
into the wheelchair."

01:16:18.616 --> 01:16:20.658
They'd have to strap him
in. Couldn't keep him in it.

01:16:20.659 --> 01:16:22.911
They'd strap him in the wheelchair.

01:16:22.912 --> 01:16:24.662
And he couldn't move.

01:16:24.663 --> 01:16:26.581
And he could see out of
the corner of his eye,

01:16:26.582 --> 01:16:28.750
there was an old crone

01:16:28.751 --> 01:16:32.170
and she was crawling across
the floor towards him,

01:16:32.171 --> 01:16:34.339
and he knew, instinctively,

01:16:34.340 --> 01:16:37.559
she was going to fondle his balls.

01:16:43.516 --> 01:16:46.351
His wife, Anita, went
off to the health club

01:16:46.352 --> 01:16:48.561
and she rang and said, "Hi, honey."

01:16:48.562 --> 01:16:52.607
And then there was a
certain faraway sound,

01:16:52.608 --> 01:16:56.069
as though she wasn't
necessarily up to the phone,

01:16:56.070 --> 01:16:59.280
when he put the gun in his
mouth and pulled the trigger.

01:16:59.281 --> 01:17:00.365
And that was it.

01:17:00.366 --> 01:17:03.701
Now, his son thought
he heard a book drop.

01:17:03.702 --> 01:17:06.296
'Cause it goes like that.

01:17:09.458 --> 01:17:13.128
- Quite ironic, really, when you think.
- Yeah.

01:17:13.129 --> 01:17:16.089
Yeah, well, it was kind
of that. He sort of...

01:17:16.090 --> 01:17:19.092
The way I... Same thing, the
way I came to terms with it

01:17:19.093 --> 01:17:24.722
was that this was a man who dictated
the way he was gonna live his life.

01:17:24.723 --> 01:17:27.559
He was most certainly gonna
dictate the way he left.

01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:28.977
- Yeah.
- And he did, you know.

01:17:28.978 --> 01:17:31.606
- He did exactly that, yeah.
- So...

01:17:32.398 --> 01:17:34.992
- It's sad, really.
- Very.

01:17:42.825 --> 01:17:44.993
I did love Hunter

01:17:44.994 --> 01:17:49.624
and I miss him quite a lot.

01:17:51.584 --> 01:17:54.419
Rather a lot, actually.

01:17:54.420 --> 01:18:00.592
Because he took away, when
he did what he did to himself,

01:18:00.593 --> 01:18:02.969
he took with him

01:18:02.970 --> 01:18:08.522
the raison d'être for the
kind of work we did together.

01:18:09.226 --> 01:18:11.102
It wasn't gonna happen again.

01:18:11.103 --> 01:18:15.106
It was the finality of it

01:18:15.107 --> 01:18:20.659
that perhaps is the most
shocking part for me.

01:18:21.447 --> 01:18:24.782
Because that's what
happens to everything.

01:18:24.783 --> 01:18:28.207
It disappears eventually.

01:18:39.006 --> 01:18:42.717
A lot of people want
a piece of Ralph's art,

01:18:42.718 --> 01:18:45.511
and Ralph holds onto
most of his originals,

01:18:45.512 --> 01:18:48.731
because he just does
not want to let them go.

01:18:49.350 --> 01:18:54.481
And this way somebody can get a
piece of Ralph's original artwork.

01:18:58.359 --> 01:19:00.777
Yeah, they are original.
Each one is an original.

01:19:00.778 --> 01:19:04.197
And each one's an original
because I sign each one separately

01:19:04.198 --> 01:19:08.451
and number it out of an edition.

01:19:08.452 --> 01:19:09.911
So that becomes the edition,

01:19:09.912 --> 01:19:15.384
and the edition can be
worth quite a lot of money.

01:19:37.648 --> 01:19:41.818
I'm a printmaker and we sell prints

01:19:41.819 --> 01:19:45.323
to, you know, Ralph's
collectors all over the world.

01:20:04.842 --> 01:20:07.427
It gives me a feeling of hope that,

01:20:07.428 --> 01:20:10.221
you know, I can keep the original

01:20:10.222 --> 01:20:13.521
and I can still make money.

01:20:19.273 --> 01:20:23.985
But I don't think that
it's good for me, in a way.

01:20:23.986 --> 01:20:27.822
Because it represses my spirit,

01:20:27.823 --> 01:20:31.951
my natural spirit, to
just do another drawing.

01:20:31.952 --> 01:20:35.705
And I think there's
something about that

01:20:35.706 --> 01:20:39.542
which perhaps I don't like,

01:20:39.543 --> 01:20:45.214
the idea that I'm not
only gonna sign this once

01:20:45.215 --> 01:20:47.008
and then maybe twice,

01:20:47.009 --> 01:20:49.802
or do the same drawing twice,

01:20:49.803 --> 01:20:54.149
I'm gonna sign 800 of them.

01:21:03.525 --> 01:21:06.369
Gonzo will not die.

01:21:06.779 --> 01:21:10.531
Ralph continues to
keep Hunter alive

01:21:10.532 --> 01:21:13.326
and Hunter keeps Ralph alive.

01:21:13.327 --> 01:21:15.829
- You know, the two together.
- Yeah.

01:21:20.250 --> 01:21:22.752
There's the sunshine coming in.

01:21:23.337 --> 01:21:25.505
Right. It's coming through?

01:21:25.506 --> 01:21:27.428
Testing, testing.

01:21:27.466 --> 01:21:29.884
One, two, three, four.

01:21:29.885 --> 01:21:33.889
So, Ralph, how you doing?

01:21:34.348 --> 01:21:40.901
I don't know. I'm feeling a bit
down, I think, really, somehow. Yeah.

01:21:42.189 --> 01:21:45.400
Apprehensive, anxious.

01:21:45.401 --> 01:21:46.818
And I just don't know what...

01:21:46.819 --> 01:21:50.539
It's partly to do with
getting older, you know.

01:21:51.031 --> 01:21:55.627
You don't know how...
How long it goes on.

01:21:56.203 --> 01:21:59.997
And, I don't know, I woke
up in the middle of the night

01:21:59.998 --> 01:22:02.750
and needed to go to the loo

01:22:02.751 --> 01:22:06.551
and felt...

01:22:08.841 --> 01:22:13.812
I don't know, I think I
felt slightly meaningless.

01:22:15.222 --> 01:22:18.057
That's the problem, I find,

01:22:18.058 --> 01:22:21.978
that things are a little
bit on the meaningless side.

01:22:21.979 --> 01:22:25.773
And why was I ever bothered

01:22:25.774 --> 01:22:28.067
- to do anything about it?
- Sure.

01:22:28.068 --> 01:22:32.539
Why did I ever try
to change the world?

01:22:33.490 --> 01:22:35.992
But it was...

01:22:37.828 --> 01:22:42.674
it was something to do,
you know, change the world.

01:22:49.339 --> 01:22:52.550
I left Ralph's with
my mind reeling from

01:22:52.551 --> 01:22:56.637
the sheer volume of a
lifetime's ideas and images,

01:22:56.638 --> 01:23:02.736
uplifted and inspired by an
artist's efforts to change the world.

01:23:07.149 --> 01:23:08.733
Look, you know, you've come here

01:23:08.734 --> 01:23:11.903
asking me this and asking me
that, asking me everything else.

01:23:11.904 --> 01:23:14.822
And as I go through
things, I suddenly realize

01:23:14.823 --> 01:23:17.116
I've done too much in my life.

01:23:17.117 --> 01:23:19.994
Really, what was the
point of all that?

01:23:19.995 --> 01:23:21.954
There is no need to do any more

01:23:21.955 --> 01:23:24.123
and yet I probably
may do some more,

01:23:24.124 --> 01:23:26.792
and I don't really
think it's a good idea

01:23:26.793 --> 01:23:31.506
because you become a polluter,
you know, a visual polluter.

01:23:31.507 --> 01:23:34.009
How about that?

01:23:45.437 --> 01:23:49.316
And I still haven't
proved that I'm an artist.

01:23:49.900 --> 01:23:53.402
Somehow I'm a cartoonist
to some, and that's...

01:23:53.403 --> 01:23:55.905
The cartoonist.

01:25:12.941 --> 01:25:16.777
It's amazing to see an artist
as they jump into the unknown,

01:25:16.778 --> 01:25:19.280
commit to the impossible.

01:25:21.158 --> 01:25:23.909
Make no mistake, Ralph.

01:25:23.910 --> 01:25:26.370
You are an inspiration.

01:25:26.371 --> 01:25:28.873
For no good reason.

01:25:41.345 --> 01:25:43.054
Is that all right?

01:25:43.055 --> 01:25:45.432
Perfect, yes.
