WEBVTT

00:06.540 --> 00:09.543
That's Russian, I think
they want us to get out.

00:09.577 --> 00:12.413
Very observant, Mr. Palmer.

00:12.446 --> 00:15.416
Okay, hey, the guns
are unnecessary, all right?

00:15.449 --> 00:17.385
I am a complete
physical coward.

00:17.418 --> 00:20.621
What exactly are
you looking for?

00:20.654 --> 00:22.290
I-I'm not a threat.

00:24.692 --> 00:26.494
It is my duty to inform you

00:26.527 --> 00:28.662
that this van
is the property of NCIS,

00:28.696 --> 00:30.731
and you're committing
a federal offense

00:30.764 --> 00:33.067
by... by searching...

00:33.101 --> 00:34.435
I don't think they care, Doctor.

00:55.423 --> 00:57.225
Diplomatic.

00:57.258 --> 01:00.228
Thanks, I was trying to
strike a discreet tone.

01:00.261 --> 01:04.298
No, Mr. Palmer, the plates
on their SUV were diplomatic.

01:04.332 --> 01:09.137
Yeah, fair to say Jethro's
little ruse is working.

01:12.440 --> 01:14.442
*

01:16.444 --> 01:20.448
Bishop, I heard you were
coming on a secret mission.

01:20.481 --> 01:22.650
Yeah, this town is
ridiculous to drive in.

01:22.683 --> 01:24.485
What's up with
the no left turns?

01:24.518 --> 01:26.120
Well, it's bad luck.

01:26.154 --> 01:28.589
But yours is good,
just in time for breakfast.

01:28.622 --> 01:29.757
No time.

01:29.790 --> 01:33.127
You need to take me
to Dr. Wade.

01:33.161 --> 01:35.496
I come bearing gifts.

01:36.697 --> 01:38.499
You could have just
brought bagels.

01:38.532 --> 01:40.168
Who says I didn't?

01:40.934 --> 01:43.471
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:43.504 --> 01:46.140
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

01:46.174 --> 01:48.509
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:48.542 --> 01:49.743
* How, how, how, how

01:49.777 --> 01:52.146
* Hey, hey

01:57.818 --> 01:59.453
* You gotta come on.

02:01.855 --> 02:03.424
Pavlenko was just
in New Orleans.

02:03.457 --> 02:04.858
Need to know why.

02:04.892 --> 02:06.860
Gibbs figures
his body holds a clue.

02:06.894 --> 02:08.862
So you shanghaied his
body and drove all night.

02:08.896 --> 02:10.264
That's badass, Bishop.

02:10.298 --> 02:11.732
Nerve-racking.

02:11.765 --> 02:13.567
Sure I'd be pulled over
by highway patrol.

02:13.601 --> 02:15.803
Had no idea how to explain the
dead Russian diplomat in my van.

02:15.836 --> 02:17.838
Wouldn't be the weirdest
thing they ever saw.

02:17.871 --> 02:19.273
Not by far.

02:21.309 --> 02:22.710
Hi, Dr. Wade.

02:22.743 --> 02:24.912
Special Agent Bishop,
what a surprise.

02:24.945 --> 02:28.549
Uh, I wasn't alerted
of any homicides this morning.

02:28.582 --> 02:30.551
Technically,
he died last night.

02:30.584 --> 02:32.920
Well, sad news to be sure,
but this is highly irregular.

02:32.953 --> 02:34.755
It's a medical examiner's job

02:34.788 --> 02:37.191
to secure the body, transfer it
from the crime scene.

02:37.225 --> 02:38.826
Chain of custody to consider.

02:38.859 --> 02:41.929
Well, chain of custody
doesn't really apply here.

02:43.797 --> 02:45.199
Does Dwayne know about this?

02:45.233 --> 02:46.600
PRIDE:
Package has been received.

02:46.634 --> 02:48.836
We'll hopefully have
some answers soon.

02:48.869 --> 02:50.838
GIBBS:
Problems?

02:50.871 --> 02:52.606
Loretta was not to thrilled.

02:52.640 --> 02:53.841
How'd the director take it?

02:53.874 --> 02:55.843
Oh,
you don't want to know.

02:55.876 --> 02:58.446
'Cause if you did tell him,

02:58.479 --> 03:00.581
he'd be required
to inform the Russians.

03:00.614 --> 03:02.816
Well, Russians
are already pissed.

03:02.850 --> 03:05.219
Their attaché's not only dead
but missing.

03:05.253 --> 03:07.655
I'd be pissed, too.

03:07.688 --> 03:09.557
So where does that
leave us, Gibbs?

03:09.590 --> 03:11.959
Other than on the brink
of an international incident?

03:11.992 --> 03:13.961
Well, we got five bodies
to consider...

03:13.994 --> 03:15.563
Jenner Blye's airplane.

03:15.596 --> 03:17.298
Yeah, Pavlenko's our only link.

03:17.331 --> 03:20.301
His body might hold the answer.

03:20.334 --> 03:22.303
And before he died,
he was here in New Orleans

03:22.336 --> 03:25.739
at a secret meeting with
our tech billionaire, Blye.

03:25.773 --> 03:28.409
And he's missing,
and he's probably dead.

03:28.442 --> 03:29.843
Yeah.

03:29.877 --> 03:31.845
Meeting was about Manta Ray?

03:31.879 --> 03:34.248
DoD compartmented project?

03:34.282 --> 03:35.883
Not anymore.

03:35.916 --> 03:37.318
I spoke to SecDef.

03:37.351 --> 03:38.719
He read me in.

03:38.752 --> 03:39.920
And you're next.

03:41.755 --> 03:43.557
Bishop?

03:43.591 --> 03:45.393
Hey, Brody.

03:45.426 --> 03:47.861
Had to come back from the
morgue, do some Russia research.

03:49.863 --> 03:51.665
Oh, I'm sitting on
your desk, aren't I?

03:51.699 --> 03:54.268
That's okay, stay comfortable,
make yourself at home.

03:54.302 --> 03:55.436
I'll-I'll brew you
a cup of green tea.

03:55.469 --> 03:56.737
Okay, hold on.

03:58.706 --> 04:00.274
What's up?

04:00.308 --> 04:02.276
Nothing.

04:02.310 --> 04:03.311
I'm gonna make
your tea.

04:03.344 --> 04:04.578
Mm.

04:04.612 --> 04:05.779
You know, don't you?

04:07.315 --> 04:08.982
You know about my divorce.

04:09.016 --> 04:11.419
Uh, McGee may have let
it slip on the phone,

04:11.452 --> 04:13.020
but I will not
say a word.

04:13.053 --> 04:15.856
SONJA:
Morning.

04:15.889 --> 04:17.858
Bishop, right?

04:17.891 --> 04:19.860
I'm Sonja Percy.

04:19.893 --> 04:21.295
Ah, the other new girl.

04:21.329 --> 04:23.297
It's nice
to finally meet you.

04:23.331 --> 04:26.700
Oh, and sorry
about your divorce.

04:26.734 --> 04:28.536
I may have let
it slip once.

04:28.569 --> 04:30.304
Okay.
Ellie.

04:30.338 --> 04:32.340
Hey.

04:32.373 --> 04:33.874
Hey, how you doing?
Good.

04:33.907 --> 04:35.309
Good, good.

04:35.343 --> 04:36.710
Listen, when
the case is done,

04:36.744 --> 04:37.945
we're gonna head
over to Sal's,

04:37.978 --> 04:39.347
crawfish and beer,

04:39.380 --> 04:41.482
and we'll sort
this all out.

04:42.516 --> 04:43.684
Maybe twice?

04:43.717 --> 04:45.686
All right,
project Manta Ray

04:45.719 --> 04:47.521
from Blye Industries.

04:47.555 --> 04:48.956
Next generation warship,

04:48.989 --> 04:50.824
undetectable by radar,

04:50.858 --> 04:52.893
able to deliver
missile payload

04:52.926 --> 04:54.728
anywhere in the world.
Never heard of it.

04:54.762 --> 04:55.963
'Cause it never
got off the ground.

04:55.996 --> 04:57.998
Shelved a year ago, too costly.

04:58.031 --> 04:59.833
Well, someone's killing for it.

04:59.867 --> 05:01.969
Best guess: Russian government.

05:02.002 --> 05:03.937
PRIDE:
One suspect in particular,

05:03.971 --> 05:08.376
Eva Azarova, GRU sleeper agent
trained as a special operative.

05:08.409 --> 05:10.378
Been in New Orleans
the last six months,

05:10.411 --> 05:13.381
gathering intel on Jenner Blye
and probably Manta Ray.

05:13.414 --> 05:15.583
May have killed Pavlenko and
the others after they found out

05:15.616 --> 05:17.050
what she was doing for
the Russian government.

05:17.084 --> 05:19.653
If she doesn't want
to be found, she won't be.

05:19.687 --> 05:21.955
Well, one person
who can help us.

05:27.995 --> 05:29.397
Luca?

05:29.430 --> 05:31.064
Agent Pride.

05:31.098 --> 05:33.467
Been too long.

05:35.102 --> 05:36.670
You expecting anyone?

05:36.704 --> 05:38.672
No.

05:38.706 --> 05:40.107
I'm all alone.

05:40.140 --> 05:41.942
I join you?

05:41.975 --> 05:43.377
Sure.

05:45.178 --> 05:46.914
PRIDE:
I'll take a dozen.

05:46.947 --> 05:49.750
Abby put a tracking device
in my shoe, didn't she?

05:49.783 --> 05:51.452
It's like college
all over again.

05:53.120 --> 05:57.090
No, she just figured after
two days away from home,

05:57.124 --> 05:59.159
you'd want oysters.

05:59.192 --> 06:00.594
You've wasted your time.

06:00.628 --> 06:02.896
I have no idea
where Eva is.

06:02.930 --> 06:04.865
She came in five minutes ago.

06:04.898 --> 06:06.099
She's in the ladies'.

06:07.735 --> 06:09.102
No back exit.

06:09.136 --> 06:10.438
Only way out's
through the front.

06:10.471 --> 06:11.639
Agent Pride, is it?

06:18.111 --> 06:19.413
Have a seat.

06:19.447 --> 06:21.682
I'm not staying.

06:21.715 --> 06:23.684
Like to ask you some questions.

06:23.717 --> 06:25.185
About what?

06:25.218 --> 06:27.020
PRIDE:
Six murders.

06:27.054 --> 06:29.857
Possibly a seventh.

06:29.890 --> 06:32.092
Including your
boss, Pavlenko.

06:33.494 --> 06:35.529
I haven't killed anyone.

06:35.563 --> 06:37.097
Then you won't mind coming in.

06:37.130 --> 06:39.066
I do mind.

06:39.099 --> 06:41.702
And if you don't tell
your agents to stop moving,

06:41.735 --> 06:43.203
I will start shooting.

06:43.236 --> 06:45.138
Whoa, Eva,
where'd that gun come from?

06:47.240 --> 06:50.043
It's all right, Luca.

06:50.077 --> 06:53.647
If she was gonna shoot, she
would have done it already.

06:53.681 --> 06:56.650
You don't want a scene,
and neither do I.

06:56.684 --> 06:59.487
I haven't hurt anyone yet,
and I don't want to start now,

06:59.520 --> 07:02.089
so just let me go in peace.

07:02.122 --> 07:03.824
Afraid I can't do that.

07:03.857 --> 07:05.092
MAN:
Oysters are up.

07:05.125 --> 07:07.194
Look, the food's here.

07:07.227 --> 07:08.862
Let's eat,

07:08.896 --> 07:10.564
and-and just figure
something out.

07:10.598 --> 07:12.032
Luca...

07:13.233 --> 07:15.168
...let your faith be bigger
than your fear.

07:16.837 --> 07:18.205
Yeah, that's a good
idea, Luca.

07:18.238 --> 07:19.640
Let's eat, okay?

07:19.673 --> 07:21.208
Come on.

07:30.518 --> 07:32.553
Hold Luca here.

07:56.610 --> 07:57.210
LUCA:
Am I under arrest?

07:57.244 --> 07:58.679
Not at the moment.

07:58.712 --> 07:59.680
Then I'm free to go.

07:59.713 --> 08:00.948
Didn't say that either.

08:00.981 --> 08:04.184
We found weapons, cash,

08:04.217 --> 08:07.621
and recording devices
in your house.

08:07.655 --> 08:11.124
Now you're helping
a suspected murderer.

08:11.158 --> 08:12.793
Eva's my friend.

08:14.061 --> 08:16.263
Come on now, Luca.

08:16.296 --> 08:18.265
Eva's a spy.

08:18.298 --> 08:20.768
She pretended
to be your friend.

08:20.801 --> 08:22.169
She seduced you,

08:22.202 --> 08:23.871
she drugged you,

08:23.904 --> 08:27.040
she dumped you
in a roadside motel.

08:27.074 --> 08:28.876
You're just like Abby.

08:28.909 --> 08:30.878
So untrusting.

08:30.911 --> 08:34.314
Untrusting is the last word
I would ever use

08:34.347 --> 08:36.249
to describe your sister.

08:37.818 --> 08:39.319
Go on, eat, kid.

08:39.352 --> 08:40.320
Can't eat that.

08:40.353 --> 08:41.689
Bread's no good.

08:41.722 --> 08:44.658
Fresh baked.
From the store.

08:47.360 --> 08:50.163
I apologize for not
baking it myself.

08:50.197 --> 08:53.166
Been kind of busy keeping
you out of trouble.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.669
Luca...

08:57.270 --> 08:59.039
I need your help.

08:59.072 --> 09:01.041
Need to know

09:01.074 --> 09:03.611
how to find Eva
and bring her in.

09:03.644 --> 09:07.615
Dwayne, I know it looks bad.

09:07.648 --> 09:10.618
I get that Eva isn't everything,

09:10.651 --> 09:14.054
or even anything,
that she claimed to be,

09:14.087 --> 09:17.257
but I also know
that she's good inside.

09:17.290 --> 09:20.293
I won't help you trap her,

09:20.327 --> 09:21.995
no matter what
you're gonna do to me.

09:22.029 --> 09:23.831
What I'm gonna do to you...

09:24.932 --> 09:26.299
I'm gonna keep you here...

09:27.300 --> 09:28.802
...so you don't get hurt.

09:28.836 --> 09:31.371
You can think about
everything I just said,

09:31.404 --> 09:32.973
however...

09:34.274 --> 09:36.777
...I'm the least
of your worries.

09:36.810 --> 09:38.812
ABBY:
Hello, Dwayne?
Abby.

09:38.846 --> 09:40.247
Please tell me
my brother's there.

09:40.280 --> 09:42.049
Yeah, he's right here.

09:45.786 --> 09:47.154
What you got, Miss Loretta?

09:47.187 --> 09:48.388
"What we know is not much.

09:48.421 --> 09:50.390
What we don't
know is enormous."

09:50.423 --> 09:51.992
How's that now?

09:52.025 --> 09:55.629
Pierre-Simon
de Laplace.

09:55.663 --> 09:56.830
Is he our suspect?

09:56.864 --> 09:58.666
No, Christopher.

09:58.699 --> 10:01.101
He's a French astronomer,
died in 1827.

10:01.134 --> 10:02.269
Those were
his last words.

10:02.302 --> 10:04.972
"Now comes the mystery."

10:05.005 --> 10:07.675
Oh, I'm afraid
I don't know that one.

10:07.708 --> 10:09.109
Henry Ward Beecher,

10:09.142 --> 10:10.944
a social reformer
and abolitionist.

10:10.978 --> 10:13.714
Well played, Ducky.

10:15.315 --> 10:17.818
How about our victim,
is he telling you anything?

10:17.851 --> 10:19.219
Uh, not much.

10:19.252 --> 10:21.421
But I can confirm
Mr. Pavlenko's death

10:21.454 --> 10:24.291
was caused by a very
powerful neurotoxin.

10:24.324 --> 10:26.860
Batrachotoxin, to be precise.

10:26.894 --> 10:29.362
Same as the five bodies
on the plane.

10:29.396 --> 10:30.798
Well, it doesn't seem
like that was worth

10:30.831 --> 10:32.199
all the smoke and mirrors

10:32.232 --> 10:33.834
to sneak him down here,
just for that.

10:33.867 --> 10:35.368
Patience, Agent Lasalle.

10:35.402 --> 10:37.170
Dr. Wade isn't finished.

10:37.204 --> 10:39.873
Yes, there's
something else.

10:40.841 --> 10:42.175
Mosquitos.

10:42.209 --> 10:43.677
Louisiana state bird.

10:43.711 --> 10:45.312
Oh, he has at least a dozen
of these bites

10:45.345 --> 10:47.047
on his ankles and arms.

10:47.080 --> 10:49.983
And judging by the inflammation,
recently acquired.

10:50.017 --> 10:51.685
I've taken samples

10:51.719 --> 10:53.987
and given them to Sebastian
to analyze.

10:54.021 --> 10:55.923
"I drank what?"

10:55.956 --> 10:57.257
Socrates'
last words,

10:57.290 --> 10:58.992
right after drinking hemlock.

11:00.327 --> 11:02.429
We're not doing that anymore,

11:02.462 --> 11:04.765
are we?

11:04.798 --> 11:06.767
Okay, well, I'm processing
the blood samples

11:06.800 --> 11:08.702
that I've gotten so far.

11:08.736 --> 11:11.471
Mosquitos can sometimes leave
microscopic traces behind.

11:11.504 --> 11:13.473
Theoretically,
a biological GPS.

11:13.506 --> 11:16.109
So these bites can tell us
where Pavlenko's been?

11:16.944 --> 11:18.378
Well, when do
we get the results?

11:18.411 --> 11:19.747
Oh.

11:19.780 --> 11:21.915
That'd be now.

11:21.949 --> 11:24.184
Sebastian did an analysis

11:24.217 --> 11:25.753
on Pavlenko's bug bites.

11:25.786 --> 11:27.420
Came back with a full spectrum

11:27.454 --> 11:29.389
of the little critter's
ecosystem--

11:29.422 --> 11:31.424
bacteria, plant life,

11:31.458 --> 11:32.926
and some other stuff.

11:32.960 --> 11:34.862
Points to a single
geographic area

11:34.895 --> 11:37.865
in the wetlands, hundred miles
outside of New Orleans.

11:37.898 --> 11:40.367
Well, what's the Russian
attaché doing in the boonies?

11:40.400 --> 11:42.102
Sightseeing?
No.

11:42.135 --> 11:43.470
This is a protected habitat.

11:43.503 --> 11:44.504
Some sort of rare turtle.

11:44.537 --> 11:46.339
No people allowed.

11:46.373 --> 11:49.209
However, I was able
to call in a favor to the NSA

11:49.242 --> 11:51.244
and get the most recent
satellite images.

11:53.546 --> 11:54.915
What am I looking at?

11:54.948 --> 11:56.183
Park ranger station?

11:56.216 --> 11:58.218
Not that far into the wetlands,

11:58.251 --> 11:59.486
an unmanned research facility

11:59.519 --> 12:01.521
set up to monitor the ecosystem.

12:01.554 --> 12:03.891
Owned and operated
by Blye Industries.

12:03.924 --> 12:06.326
And according
to thermal imaging...

12:07.460 --> 12:08.428
...there's someone in there.

12:08.461 --> 12:10.530
*

12:37.357 --> 12:39.827
MAN:
Whoa!

12:40.460 --> 12:41.962
Jenner Blye?

12:41.995 --> 12:43.797
In the flesh.

12:45.498 --> 12:48.936
NCIS Agents Pride
and Lasalle.

12:48.969 --> 12:51.571
You alone?
Yeah.

12:51.604 --> 12:54.107
You got a lot of people
lookin' for you.

12:54.141 --> 12:56.476
We gotta get you to safety.

12:56.509 --> 12:57.544
Not going anywhere.

12:57.577 --> 12:59.146
Your life is in danger.

12:59.179 --> 13:00.881
Not the first time.

13:00.914 --> 13:02.816
You don't understand.
BLYE:
But I do.

13:02.850 --> 13:04.517
I know exactly what kind
of danger I'm in.

13:04.551 --> 13:07.187
What happened
to the people on my plane.

13:07.220 --> 13:08.421
It's why I'm
staying here

13:08.455 --> 13:09.489
until you
sort it out.

13:09.522 --> 13:12.292
I got water, food...

13:15.362 --> 13:16.796
Nothing to worry about.

13:21.568 --> 13:23.503
PRIDE:
Hey. Hey.

13:34.614 --> 13:36.416
Jenner's been through
a terrible ordeal.

13:36.449 --> 13:37.851
Just spoke with his doctor.

13:37.885 --> 13:39.119
He has some sort of

13:39.152 --> 13:41.321
neurotoxin in his blood system.

13:41.354 --> 13:42.990
He's lucky to be alive.

13:43.023 --> 13:44.457
He may have permanent
paralysis in his left leg.

13:44.491 --> 13:45.959
He needs his rest.

13:45.993 --> 13:47.360
We understand that,

13:47.394 --> 13:48.495
but we just need to ask him
a few questions.

13:48.528 --> 13:49.930
You're gonna
have to wait.

13:49.963 --> 13:51.098
Back it up, Huxley.

13:51.131 --> 13:53.200
Boys saved my life.

13:53.233 --> 13:55.335
Let 'em ask their questions.

13:58.906 --> 14:00.107
Want to tell us

14:00.140 --> 14:02.209
about Manta Ray?

14:02.242 --> 14:03.576
Project we started for the Navy.

14:03.610 --> 14:05.378
Something special,
something different.

14:05.412 --> 14:08.315
So, of course, DoD decided
to scrap the project.

14:08.348 --> 14:09.883
Don't be cynical, Dalton.

14:09.917 --> 14:11.518
DoD gave us the green light

14:11.551 --> 14:13.353
to create a modified version

14:13.386 --> 14:14.354
of the ship

14:14.387 --> 14:16.056
for commercial use.

14:16.089 --> 14:18.425
Non-weaponized.

14:18.458 --> 14:21.194
Sold it to a Norwegian company
for oil exploration.

14:21.228 --> 14:22.429
How do Russians figure in?

14:22.462 --> 14:24.231
Backstrum Drull.

14:24.264 --> 14:26.533
A shell corporation
created in Moscow

14:26.566 --> 14:29.903
to buy foreign technology
otherwise unavailable to them.

14:32.339 --> 14:35.442
SONJA:
Norwegian national police
raided Backstrum Drull's

14:35.475 --> 14:37.210
factory early this morning.

14:37.244 --> 14:39.379
No sign of the ship at all.

14:39.412 --> 14:41.448
BRODY:
Manta Ray may already be built
and at sea.

14:41.481 --> 14:44.617
Russians were able
to trick Blye Industries

14:44.651 --> 14:46.286
into giving up Manta Ray.

14:46.319 --> 14:48.121
Then, when their plot
was exposed,

14:48.155 --> 14:50.357
they tried to kill
anyone in the know.

14:50.390 --> 14:53.393
One Russian has had access
to all of our victims.

14:53.426 --> 14:55.028
SONJA:
Eva Azarova.

14:55.062 --> 14:57.597
Not just a spy, but an assassin.

14:57.630 --> 15:00.067
If assassinating anyone

15:00.100 --> 15:01.969
with knowledge of the plot
was Eva's goal,

15:02.002 --> 15:03.971
then why stick around?
Why not split?

15:04.004 --> 15:05.372
I don't know. Maybe, uh...

15:05.405 --> 15:07.474
the job's not done.

15:07.507 --> 15:10.410
Commander Lively and Pavlenko
met at Jenner Blye's house.

15:10.443 --> 15:12.012
Who else was there?

15:12.045 --> 15:13.280
That'd be me.

15:14.347 --> 15:16.416
I was cooking that night.

15:19.386 --> 15:21.421
Come on.

15:21.454 --> 15:22.489
Don't hold anything back.

15:22.522 --> 15:23.723
Hold what back?

15:23.756 --> 15:25.225
Tell it to me straight.

15:25.258 --> 15:27.027
All the gory details.
I can handle it.

15:27.060 --> 15:29.329
Sebastian, what are
you talking about?

15:29.362 --> 15:31.398
And what are you doing?

15:32.499 --> 15:34.334
Huh? Oh, h-hold on.

15:34.367 --> 15:36.203
I got Dr. Mallard here.
He's talking me through

15:36.236 --> 15:38.271
the effects of
the batrachotoxin.

15:38.305 --> 15:39.672
My glove ripped
while I was handling

15:39.706 --> 15:41.108
the evidence from
Jenner Blye's cabin.

15:41.141 --> 15:42.575
Do you have any
hand sanitizer?

15:42.609 --> 15:45.478
Sebastian, if you've had contact
with batrachotoxin,

15:45.512 --> 15:48.181
hand sanitizer
will do you no good.

15:48.215 --> 15:49.749
Oh, man. That bad, huh?

15:49.782 --> 15:51.584
All right, well,
tell me the truth.

15:51.618 --> 15:54.421
Does it look like my nervous
system is shutting down?

15:54.454 --> 15:56.456
Considering
you're not convulsing,

15:56.489 --> 15:57.724
I think you'll be okay.

15:57.757 --> 15:59.192
Now move away from my closet.

15:59.226 --> 16:01.028
I don't want
Hurricane Sebastian

16:01.061 --> 16:03.330
blowing through
my shelves again.

16:03.363 --> 16:04.397
Oh, no, Dr. Mallard.

16:04.431 --> 16:06.266
I wasn't blowing
through anything.

16:06.299 --> 16:08.001
I was anxiously sifting,
if we're going to put a label..

16:08.035 --> 16:09.269
Ow! Ow, ow, ow.

16:09.302 --> 16:10.303
What is it?

16:10.337 --> 16:11.338
Oh, man, some kind of

16:11.371 --> 16:12.505
interference in the Bluetooth.

16:14.141 --> 16:18.345
Ooh. It gets worse as I get
closer to the freezers.

16:18.378 --> 16:19.446
Ah...

16:28.821 --> 16:31.191
SEBASTIAN:
It's a listening device
and a transmitter

16:31.224 --> 16:32.525
hidden inside an implant.

16:32.559 --> 16:34.561
Mandibular 19,
to be exact.

16:34.594 --> 16:36.596
And it's operating?

16:36.629 --> 16:40.500
Means someone's been listening
to every word said in autopsy.

16:40.533 --> 16:43.170
Now they know Pavlenko's
body is here.

16:43.203 --> 16:44.437
So much for
off the books.

16:44.471 --> 16:46.506
Yeah, but if it's the Russians,

16:46.539 --> 16:47.774
why haven't they come
to claim their body?

16:47.807 --> 16:50.310
Espionage, Sebastian.

16:50.343 --> 16:53.146
He's more valuable
in our custody...

16:53.180 --> 16:55.548
where they can monitor
everything we say.

16:55.582 --> 16:57.117
That's all right.

16:57.150 --> 17:00.053
We can use this
to draw them in.

17:00.087 --> 17:01.688
Sebastian...

17:01.721 --> 17:03.756
You up for a road trip?

17:06.159 --> 17:08.695
Man, gotta hand it
to them Russians.

17:08.728 --> 17:10.463
They OG with their tradecraft.

17:10.497 --> 17:12.432
Man had a transmitter
hidden in his tooth

17:12.465 --> 17:14.101
and he probably
didn't even know it.

17:14.134 --> 17:15.502
Can you trace the signal?

17:15.535 --> 17:17.470
Oh, I got in on
their frequency right away.

17:17.504 --> 17:19.139
Triangulation is a bit trickier.

17:19.172 --> 17:20.473
If it was one of ours,

17:20.507 --> 17:22.309
it would the size
of a fleck of dust

17:22.342 --> 17:24.277
that could be monitored
from halfway around the world.

17:24.311 --> 17:25.512
Man, I'd be all over that thing.

17:25.545 --> 17:26.746
But it's one of theirs.

17:26.779 --> 17:28.481
Old school, right?

17:28.515 --> 17:30.783
Yeah, Ruskies, they still
analog in the digital world.

17:30.817 --> 17:33.453
That's that Kruschev
five-year plan mess.

17:35.122 --> 17:37.624
Wait. I think I found
the origin of the signal.

17:37.657 --> 17:40.293
It's here, in New Orleans.

17:40.327 --> 17:42.795
Brighton House, huh?

17:42.829 --> 17:45.132
Not exactly cloak-and-dagger.

17:45.165 --> 17:46.666
More like
gin and tonic.

17:48.635 --> 17:51.604
But Patton backtraced the
transmitter signal to here.

17:59.746 --> 18:02.615
Yo, is that dubstep?

18:04.284 --> 18:06.886
:
Uh, you have to excuse Yanov.

18:08.621 --> 18:11.491
His taste in music
is atrocious.

18:11.524 --> 18:12.692
And you are?

18:12.725 --> 18:14.527
Paulina Kurteva.

18:16.596 --> 18:17.730
GRU.

18:17.764 --> 18:19.599
Well, actually, Dwayne,

18:19.632 --> 18:21.734
I work in
the diplomatic corps now.

18:21.768 --> 18:25.138
And you two know each other?

18:25.172 --> 18:26.739
We worked the same case.

18:26.773 --> 18:29.209
A crooked Marine embassy guard

18:29.242 --> 18:31.711
took advantage
of a naive Russian woman

18:31.744 --> 18:33.546
who worked for
the Foreign Service.

18:33.580 --> 18:35.482
Close.

18:35.515 --> 18:37.750
My Marine was the victim.

18:37.784 --> 18:40.920
Your "naive woman"

18:40.953 --> 18:42.555
was a honey trap.

18:42.589 --> 18:44.591
Agree to disagree.

18:45.825 --> 18:48.328
We need to talk, Paulina.

18:48.361 --> 18:50.597
The last time you and I talked

18:50.630 --> 18:52.632
was at a Turkish
coffeehouse

18:52.665 --> 18:56.736
and you recorded
the entire conversation.

19:00.573 --> 19:02.342
You can check me for a wire.

19:05.245 --> 19:06.813
Let's walk.

19:06.846 --> 19:09.349
Tell me about
Anton Pavlenko.

19:09.382 --> 19:12.219
Very sad state of affairs.

19:12.252 --> 19:13.886
Complicated by the fact

19:13.920 --> 19:17.357
that your agency
misplaced his body.

19:17.390 --> 19:19.859
You know exactly
where Pavlenko is.

19:19.892 --> 19:21.561
It's the reason
you're in New Orleans.

19:21.594 --> 19:25.565
I am in New Orleans
for rest and relaxation.

19:25.598 --> 19:28.668
Your men,
their tattoos...

19:28.701 --> 19:30.903
Russian Special Forces.

19:30.937 --> 19:34.374
Even soldiers
deserve a break.

19:38.678 --> 19:40.447
And Eva Azarova?

19:40.480 --> 19:42.749
I don't know that name.

19:42.782 --> 19:44.417
Should I?

19:46.686 --> 19:50.223
You haven't been using listening
devices, now, have you, Paulina?

19:51.791 --> 19:54.694
Now that would be considered
an act of espionage.

19:54.727 --> 19:56.696
Yeah, that's right.

19:56.729 --> 19:59.932
Only this time,
it'd be me arresting you.

20:01.634 --> 20:04.003
However, here I am,

20:04.036 --> 20:05.705
enjoying a Bloody Mary

20:05.738 --> 20:08.675
and not a handcuff
in sight.

20:11.911 --> 20:13.913
Not yet.

20:18.951 --> 20:21.454
ABBY:
From what I can tell,
it's Russian.

20:21.488 --> 20:23.756
The microcircuitry
is primitive.

20:23.790 --> 20:24.891
Yeah, and since
it's spy tech,

20:24.924 --> 20:26.759
there's probably
no serial number.

20:26.793 --> 20:28.027
Do you think
it's still on?

20:28.060 --> 20:29.596
No, Patton said that
he redirected the...

20:30.997 --> 20:32.432
...redirected the signal

20:32.465 --> 20:33.666
to control the
transmission, but...

20:33.700 --> 20:35.435
you know,
better safe than sorry.

20:35.468 --> 20:37.504
Spent the whole flight
just repeating stuff

20:37.537 --> 20:38.638
I read in Jack Ryan novels.

20:38.671 --> 20:40.507
So how's my brother?

20:40.540 --> 20:41.941
Uh, I haven't seen him.

20:41.974 --> 20:44.711
Been at the lab,
and he's being detained at NCIS.

20:44.744 --> 20:45.978
"Detained"?

20:46.012 --> 20:47.647
Like a prisoner?

20:47.680 --> 20:49.649
Uh, no. No, no, no, no.

20:49.682 --> 20:51.551
Just in the sense that,
you know, he can't leave,

20:51.584 --> 20:53.853
uh, or do anything

20:53.886 --> 20:56.856
and-and has to be monitored.

20:58.858 --> 21:00.660
Luca just doesn't get it.

21:00.693 --> 21:03.663
He could be in real trouble
here and go to real jail.

21:03.696 --> 21:06.065
All because of some
girl he met at church

21:06.098 --> 21:07.700
and he thinks he can save.

21:07.734 --> 21:10.370
You should tell him
that, Abby.

21:10.403 --> 21:12.372
I can't.

21:12.405 --> 21:14.841
He won't answer
my phone calls or my texts

21:14.874 --> 21:16.042
or my e-mails.

21:16.075 --> 21:17.076
A serial number.

21:17.109 --> 21:19.579
On the tooth?!

21:19.612 --> 21:21.448
On the tooth.

21:23.416 --> 21:24.784
LASALLE:
How'd it go?

21:24.817 --> 21:26.719
Pride saw an old friend today.

21:26.753 --> 21:28.521
Friend's a word for it.

21:28.555 --> 21:31.924
Uh, did you know Pride got
arrested in Moscow once?

21:31.958 --> 21:34.694
Been arrested in a lot
of interesting places, Sonja.

21:34.727 --> 21:36.796
Other than that,
did the Russians spill?

21:36.829 --> 21:38.030
Didn't expect 'em to.

21:38.064 --> 21:41.434
My man. My man,
my man, my man.

21:41.468 --> 21:43.069
Talk to me.
Did a good job, brother.

21:43.102 --> 21:44.471
SONJA:
Did good how?

21:44.504 --> 21:46.473
Oh, I put a program
in Pride's phone

21:46.506 --> 21:48.775
that allowed me to clone
any other cell phone

21:48.808 --> 21:50.377
it comes
in contact with.

21:50.410 --> 21:51.811
And it worked?
Like a charm.

21:51.844 --> 21:53.780
I'm imbedded in one
of those Russian phones.

21:53.813 --> 21:55.815
Brody and Bishop are following
the Russians as we speak,

21:55.848 --> 21:57.350
picking up every word
they're saying.

21:57.384 --> 21:58.685
*

22:24.911 --> 22:26.779
Can't listen
to any more of this.

22:26.813 --> 22:28.815
Driving around for 45 minutes,

22:28.848 --> 22:30.717
and Boris won't shut up
about his girlfriend.

22:30.750 --> 22:31.951
I think his name is Ilya.

22:31.984 --> 22:33.486
Boris is the one
with the shaved head.

22:33.520 --> 22:34.721
Mm.

22:34.754 --> 22:35.955
Listen, if you
need to talk

22:35.988 --> 22:37.824
about your divorce...
I don't.

22:37.857 --> 22:40.427
Okay.

22:40.460 --> 22:41.861
I get it.

22:41.894 --> 22:43.796
We barely know each other.

22:43.830 --> 22:45.698
It's your personal
business.

22:45.732 --> 22:47.400
I'll stay out of it.

22:47.434 --> 22:50.903
Everyone expects me to have
some kind of profound feeling,

22:50.937 --> 22:53.105
like the earth's moved and
my world's changed overnight,

22:53.139 --> 22:56.743
but the truth is
it doesn't feel any different.

22:56.776 --> 22:59.946
I'm still me,
Jake is still Jake.

22:59.979 --> 23:01.581
We just aren't together anymore,

23:01.614 --> 23:05.585
and that's sad but also right.

23:05.618 --> 23:08.588
Wow.

23:08.621 --> 23:11.591
I feel better.

23:11.624 --> 23:13.593
Thank you for that.

23:13.626 --> 23:15.828
Anytime.

23:27.173 --> 23:29.842
*

23:36.516 --> 23:37.517
Brody.

23:40.520 --> 23:42.088
Clear.

23:42.121 --> 23:44.957
Another one.

23:44.991 --> 23:47.159
Got a third.

23:55.234 --> 23:57.069
They got away.

24:10.583 --> 24:13.119
What is that delicious smell?

24:13.152 --> 24:15.655
Osso buco, for you.

24:15.688 --> 24:17.156
Oh, I'm a...
Vegan, I know.

24:17.189 --> 24:18.758
So is this.

24:18.791 --> 24:20.860
Made with carrots
instead of veal.

24:20.893 --> 24:22.194
Okay.

24:22.228 --> 24:24.230
*

24:30.737 --> 24:32.905
Mmm. That's good.

24:32.939 --> 24:35.908
I got some of the regular stuff
for Special Agent Bishop.

24:35.942 --> 24:38.745
Oh, she's heading
back to DC,

24:38.778 --> 24:40.179
briefing the director

24:40.212 --> 24:42.081
on all the trouble
your girlfriend's causing.

24:42.114 --> 24:44.083
Not my girlfriend.

24:44.116 --> 24:46.085
I mean, I want her to be.

24:46.118 --> 24:48.087
But there's complications,
as you know.

24:48.120 --> 24:50.690
Okay, stop, just stop.

24:50.723 --> 24:52.058
I-I know, I get it.

24:52.091 --> 24:53.993
She lied to me,
but underneath...

24:54.026 --> 24:55.728
Are more lies.

24:56.829 --> 24:58.230
Look.

24:58.264 --> 25:00.833
I know you want to believe her,

25:00.867 --> 25:02.835
but you got to accept the fact

25:02.869 --> 25:05.805
that Eva is not
who you think she is.

25:07.840 --> 25:09.809
That's not how faith works.

25:09.842 --> 25:11.844
You don't choose
to have it sometimes

25:11.878 --> 25:12.945
and not have it others.

25:12.979 --> 25:14.947
That's some church talk.

25:14.981 --> 25:17.550
Maybe.

25:17.584 --> 25:19.586
Doesn't make me wrong.

25:21.821 --> 25:24.557
I used to do
what Eva does.

25:24.591 --> 25:26.793
Worked undercover.

25:26.826 --> 25:28.861
Convinced a lot of people

25:28.895 --> 25:31.197
of a lot of things.

25:31.230 --> 25:32.765
She's wanted by us

25:32.799 --> 25:36.535
and her own people.

25:38.137 --> 25:40.873
There's nothing more
you can do for her now.

25:53.219 --> 25:55.788
Sorry if I kept you waiting.

25:55.822 --> 25:58.024
Last time we were together
in a room like this...

25:58.057 --> 26:00.627
I was on the other side
of the table.

26:00.660 --> 26:02.795
And the thermostat wasn't
working correctly,

26:02.829 --> 26:04.797
if I recall.

26:04.831 --> 26:08.034
This is gonna be good.

26:08.067 --> 26:10.369
Look at that
body language.

26:10.402 --> 26:15.107
Figured that was just an old
GRU interrogation technique.

26:15.141 --> 26:18.745
Oh, I have a subtler
touch, Dwayne.

26:18.778 --> 26:21.113
I recall.

26:21.147 --> 26:23.750
Times change, though.

26:23.783 --> 26:26.385
For instance, I see you
are no longer married.

26:26.418 --> 26:28.621
*

26:33.192 --> 26:35.161
That's the past.

26:35.194 --> 26:36.996
What the hell?

26:37.029 --> 26:39.699
Tell me what
happened today.

26:39.732 --> 26:44.170
My men were killed in a tragic
and unfortunate incident.

26:44.203 --> 26:46.405
In Eva Azarova's apartment.

26:46.438 --> 26:48.407
As attaché for
the Russian government,

26:48.440 --> 26:50.843
I have full diplomatic
immunity.

26:50.877 --> 26:52.311
I'll leave now.

26:52.344 --> 26:55.314
No, Paulina, you won't.

26:55.347 --> 26:57.917
The Russian government
has been involved

26:57.950 --> 27:00.720
in an operation
to steal U.S. Navy secrets.

27:00.753 --> 27:01.921
Project Manta Ray.

27:01.954 --> 27:02.989
That's an absurd accu...

27:03.022 --> 27:04.824
Don't play games.

27:04.857 --> 27:08.828
Anton Pavlenko, a member of your
consulate, exposed the plot.

27:08.861 --> 27:10.229
He and five others
were assassinated,

27:10.262 --> 27:14.366
probably by Eva Azarova,
your agent.

27:14.400 --> 27:18.971
Neither I nor my people
took part in any murders.

27:19.005 --> 27:20.339
I may be many
things, Dwayne...

27:20.372 --> 27:22.909
You are, Paulina.

27:24.043 --> 27:25.978
Have a seat.

27:30.817 --> 27:33.786
Eva was working directly
for Counselor Pavlenko.

27:33.820 --> 27:36.923
She was assigned
to a sensitive matter.

27:36.956 --> 27:39.125
Spying on Jenner Blye.

27:39.158 --> 27:43.462
In the last few days, we started
to question Pavlenko's loyalty.

27:43.495 --> 27:46.165
Because you were listening
to every word he said.

27:46.198 --> 27:48.701
Who's telling the story here?

27:48.735 --> 27:50.336
Sorry.

27:50.369 --> 27:51.971
Continue.

27:52.004 --> 27:55.975
I was dispatched to examine
the matter more closely.

27:56.008 --> 27:59.879
We called Eva in,
but she never responded.

27:59.912 --> 28:02.048
She's off the reservation?

28:04.150 --> 28:05.918
Work with me.

28:06.986 --> 28:08.287
We'll bring her back together,

28:08.320 --> 28:09.889
get some answers.

28:09.922 --> 28:11.758
No, I'm perfectly capable

28:11.791 --> 28:14.126
of keeping my own house
in order.

28:14.160 --> 28:16.328
Really?

28:17.764 --> 28:21.367
'Cause by my count,
you're down by five.

28:21.400 --> 28:23.369
I haven't lost anyone.

28:37.249 --> 28:39.051
PRIDE:
What the hell happened?

28:39.085 --> 28:41.487
He kicked through the back
window and jumped over the wall.

28:41.520 --> 28:42.955
Probably on his way
to find Eva.

28:42.989 --> 28:44.991
Who's probably gonna
try to kill him.

28:45.024 --> 28:46.826
I've already put
a BOLO out.

28:46.859 --> 28:48.828
Patton's monitoring his
cell phone and credit cards.

28:48.861 --> 28:50.062
We're hitting
the streets.

28:50.096 --> 28:51.463
He won't get far, King.

28:51.497 --> 28:53.099
Yeah, that's all
well and good,

28:53.132 --> 28:55.501
but there's still one thing
we need to do.

28:55.534 --> 28:57.503
Somebody's got
to tell Abby.

28:57.536 --> 29:00.472
*

29:00.506 --> 29:02.308
He did what?!

29:02.341 --> 29:03.943
How could you let this happen?!

29:03.976 --> 29:05.144
SEBASTIAN:
I... I-I didn't.

29:05.177 --> 29:06.979
I-I was here with
you, remember?

29:07.013 --> 29:08.815
Solving crime, tracking
Russian dentists.

29:08.848 --> 29:10.349
It's just, I drew the
short straw on this,

29:10.382 --> 29:12.084
so I had to be the
one to tell you.

29:12.118 --> 29:15.521
Luca has almost been killed,
like, three times in two days.

29:15.554 --> 29:17.824
Yeah, and everyone's working
really hard to get him back.

29:17.857 --> 29:20.492
That's not good
enough, Sebastian.

29:23.830 --> 29:27.433
Um...

29:27.466 --> 29:29.335
What... what are you doing?

29:29.368 --> 29:31.170
Breathing exercises.

29:31.203 --> 29:33.005
Trying to find serenity.

29:36.042 --> 29:38.811
And it's not working.

29:38.845 --> 29:42.949
If something happens to him,
I will never forgive myself.

29:42.982 --> 29:45.918
I shouldn't have let
him go back there.

29:47.253 --> 29:50.289
I can't lose him.

29:50.322 --> 29:52.124
Well, you-you haven't.

29:52.158 --> 29:54.126
It's like, um...

29:54.160 --> 29:55.928
It's like Schrodinger's cat.

29:55.962 --> 29:56.929
Okay?

29:56.963 --> 29:58.130
Cat's in
the box, right?

29:58.164 --> 29:59.966
Could be dead, could be alive,

29:59.999 --> 30:03.369
but as long as you
don't open that box,

30:03.402 --> 30:05.237
your brother's still alive.

30:07.974 --> 30:10.176
That's a horrible analogy.

30:10.209 --> 30:12.144
I know, I'm sorry, I just...
I'm not very good at analogies.

30:12.178 --> 30:13.545
Or physics.

30:13.579 --> 30:15.581
But look, look,
you-you would know

30:15.614 --> 30:17.016
if something bad
happened, right?

30:17.049 --> 30:18.217
Like with that plane.

30:18.250 --> 30:21.053
You just, you knew
that Luca was all right.

30:21.087 --> 30:22.821
Like he was sending you signals.

30:25.391 --> 30:27.960
Right.

30:27.994 --> 30:29.195
Signals.

30:29.228 --> 30:30.262
Yeah.

30:30.296 --> 30:33.265
Transmitter.

30:33.299 --> 30:36.102
It's the teeth,
Sebastian, the teeth.

30:42.008 --> 30:43.275
:
Oh.

30:43.309 --> 30:46.412
Takes more than a cup
of tea to warm me up.

30:46.445 --> 30:48.447
But you haven't
tasted it yet.

30:53.119 --> 30:55.521
I'm gonna do something
nice for you.

30:57.189 --> 31:00.226
You can do something
nice for me.

31:02.228 --> 31:04.063
What am I looking at?

31:04.096 --> 31:07.066
Your associate's teeth.

31:07.099 --> 31:08.167
Take a close look.

31:08.200 --> 31:12.204
Specifically, mandibular 19.

31:12.238 --> 31:14.073
Implants.

31:14.106 --> 31:16.175
Each implant contains
a transmitter.

31:16.208 --> 31:18.510
Jam, right?

31:18.544 --> 31:21.013
You remember.

31:21.047 --> 31:23.315
Pavlenko had one, too.

31:23.349 --> 31:25.351
It's how you tracked him
to New Orleans,

31:25.384 --> 31:27.053
listened to his conversations.

31:27.086 --> 31:29.455
We traced the implants
to a dentist

31:29.488 --> 31:33.225
in Moscow
who's making a tidy profit

31:33.259 --> 31:36.028
servicing members of the GRU.

31:36.062 --> 31:37.629
You probably been to him.

31:37.663 --> 31:40.332
Oh, these teeth are all mine.

31:40.366 --> 31:42.201
No implants.

31:42.234 --> 31:45.237
It's Eva we want.

31:45.271 --> 31:48.307
She's the one
with blood on her hands.

31:48.340 --> 31:51.377
She's not done.

31:51.410 --> 31:53.612
And she has an implant,
doesn't she?

31:55.147 --> 31:57.116
All I want is Eva's location.

31:57.149 --> 31:58.484
Give us the frequency

31:58.517 --> 32:01.253
of her transmitter.

32:01.287 --> 32:03.122
We'll work together on this.

32:03.155 --> 32:06.458
And when it's done,
you can go home.

32:21.140 --> 32:23.142
EVA:
Took you long enough.

32:25.211 --> 32:27.246
"Let your faith be bigger
than your fear."

32:27.279 --> 32:28.981
Said it at the oyster bar.

32:29.015 --> 32:30.649
And you said it
to me right here,

32:30.682 --> 32:33.485
the first time
that we kissed.

32:33.519 --> 32:36.155
You have a lot
to explain to me, Eva.

32:36.188 --> 32:38.124
They're saying
things about you.

32:38.157 --> 32:40.626
I wish I could deny them.

32:40.659 --> 32:42.561
It's true?

32:42.594 --> 32:44.563
Yes.

32:44.596 --> 32:47.433
And I want to apologize,
for what I've done,

32:47.466 --> 32:50.202
and for what
I'm about to do.

32:50.236 --> 32:51.670
What is it?

32:51.703 --> 32:53.372
What are you about to do?

32:53.405 --> 32:56.775
I knew that you would
follow me here.

32:56.808 --> 32:58.610
Even if it put you in danger.

32:58.644 --> 33:01.713
Even if everyone told
you that I was a killer.

33:01.747 --> 33:03.349
But I'm taking
advantage,

33:03.382 --> 33:06.085
because I knew that he
would follow you here, too.

33:06.118 --> 33:07.619
He's been tracking you.

33:07.653 --> 33:10.122
Who are you talking about?

33:10.156 --> 33:12.258
Luca, listen, I...

33:12.291 --> 33:13.025
Eva Azarova.

33:13.059 --> 33:15.261
Hands where we can
see them, okay?

33:17.396 --> 33:18.630
Luca,

33:18.664 --> 33:20.532
step away from her.

33:20.566 --> 33:22.434
Luca, down, down! Get down!

33:25.604 --> 33:27.306
SONJA:
Move! Down! Down!

33:42.288 --> 33:44.523
Brody, Lasalle,
you got eyes on the shooter?

33:44.556 --> 33:46.225
You got a location?

33:48.427 --> 33:50.462
Yeah, he's on the balcony,
black hat.

33:50.496 --> 33:52.231
Pride, it's Huxley.

33:52.264 --> 33:53.765
Yeah, I got him.

34:00.506 --> 34:01.773
Eva, stop!

34:16.722 --> 34:19.558
*

35:04.436 --> 35:06.238
PRIDE:
Huxley!

35:12.211 --> 35:13.445
Put it down.

35:21.887 --> 35:24.456
Time to come in, Eva.

35:26.392 --> 35:29.695
Can you explain
why Blake Huxley,

35:29.728 --> 35:33.165
Jenner Blye's security chief,
was trying to kill you?

35:33.199 --> 35:35.634
Technically, he was
trying to kill Luca.

35:35.667 --> 35:40.172
Because Luca was
the last person alive

35:40.206 --> 35:42.608
who attended a secret meeting
at Jenner Blye's house--

35:42.641 --> 35:46.478
a meeting about your people
stealing our technology.

35:46.512 --> 35:47.913
I have no people anymore.

35:47.946 --> 35:50.482
You proved that

35:50.516 --> 35:53.319
by killing
three Russian security agents.

35:53.352 --> 35:56.255
That was Huxley, too.

35:56.288 --> 36:00.892
Luca might believe
you're just a casualty here;

36:00.926 --> 36:04.530
I'm gonna need convincing.

36:04.563 --> 36:06.632
I know who's
behind that glass.

36:06.665 --> 36:10.502
And if I talk to you, she
puts me away for treason.

36:10.536 --> 36:11.803
And if I don't talk...

36:11.837 --> 36:14.172
I put you away for espionage.

36:15.541 --> 36:17.476
A woman without a country.

36:17.509 --> 36:19.311
But not without friends.

36:19.345 --> 36:23.615
"Let your faith be bigger
than your fear," right?

36:27.253 --> 36:29.655
Luca risked a lot for you.

36:29.688 --> 36:33.559
He supported you
when no one else would.

36:35.661 --> 36:37.363
At the very least,

36:37.396 --> 36:40.932
you might want to earn
his high regard here.

36:44.035 --> 36:46.938
Pavlenko was my mentor.

36:46.972 --> 36:51.009
He taught me that our work
was more than just spy games.

36:51.042 --> 36:52.911
Human lives on the line.

36:52.944 --> 36:54.713
:
Oh...

36:54.746 --> 36:58.584
So he had you seduce Luca...

36:58.617 --> 37:01.553
gather intelligence
on Jenner Blye,

37:01.587 --> 37:02.888
for human lives?

37:02.921 --> 37:06.725
Yes, actually.

37:06.758 --> 37:08.727
Pavlenko learned
that our government had stolen

37:08.760 --> 37:10.329
the Manta Ray designs.

37:11.730 --> 37:13.565
I was confirming it.

37:13.599 --> 37:15.434
The operation backfired.

37:15.467 --> 37:17.903
People started dying.

37:17.936 --> 37:19.705
But you didn't run.

37:19.738 --> 37:22.774
I needed to learn
who killed Pavlenko,

37:22.808 --> 37:24.743
make it right.

37:24.776 --> 37:27.679
But they were on
me, every moment.

37:27.713 --> 37:29.648
PRIDE:
Well, you, uh...

37:29.681 --> 37:32.518
you might want to consider
getting a new dentist.

37:34.653 --> 37:37.656
Transmitter.

37:37.689 --> 37:39.758
Mandibular 19.

37:49.468 --> 37:53.405
This is how I've lived
my entire life.

37:53.439 --> 37:56.775
Not as a person, but as a tool.

37:59.378 --> 38:01.647
But Luca sees me differently.

38:01.680 --> 38:04.883
So you used Luca as bait.

38:04.916 --> 38:07.052
Yes.

38:07.085 --> 38:08.654
In order to save his life.

38:10.856 --> 38:12.658
Otherwise, eventually,
Huxley would have murdered him.

38:12.691 --> 38:15.694
Why?

38:15.727 --> 38:20.932
Why did Blake Huxley
want everybody silenced?

38:20.966 --> 38:23.902
He serving the Russians, too?

38:25.804 --> 38:28.707
He's serving somebody.

38:30.041 --> 38:32.878
LASALLE:
Mr. Blye.

38:32.911 --> 38:33.879
Special Agent Lasalle.

38:33.912 --> 38:35.814
Spare a moment of your time?

38:35.847 --> 38:39.851
Still learning to move with
the paralysis in my left side.

38:41.687 --> 38:44.690
If I stop, I might
topple over.

38:44.723 --> 38:47.493
Lean on me.

38:47.526 --> 38:49.561
According to your
flight manifest,

38:49.595 --> 38:51.930
says you're heading
to Venezuela.

38:51.963 --> 38:55.367
They have a growing
shipping industry, new markets.

38:55.401 --> 38:57.703
And a complicated
extradition to the States.

38:57.736 --> 39:00.672
Pavlenko came to you
and your people,

39:00.706 --> 39:02.007
warning that
the Russians tricked you

39:02.040 --> 39:04.643
into selling them Manta Ray.

39:04.676 --> 39:06.812
But it wasn't a trick, was it?

39:06.845 --> 39:08.980
Watch yourself.

39:09.014 --> 39:10.716
You just accused me of treason.

39:10.749 --> 39:13.719
Also accusing you of
ordering your man Huxley

39:13.752 --> 39:15.421
to commit at least six murders.

39:15.454 --> 39:16.822
(sirens wailing,
tires screeching)

39:16.855 --> 39:18.824
Are you arresting me?

39:18.857 --> 39:21.827
I'm a sick man,
need medical attention.

39:21.860 --> 39:23.962
That's 'cause
you poisoned yourself.

39:23.995 --> 39:26.798
You wanted us to find
you in that cabin.

39:29.868 --> 39:32.971
What do you want?

39:33.004 --> 39:36.408
Other than a
full confession?

39:36.442 --> 39:38.877
How to locate
the Manta Ray.

39:44.550 --> 39:46.017
You okay?

39:46.051 --> 39:49.555
Yeah. It looks
worse than it is.

39:51.056 --> 39:54.092
They're letting me
say good-bye before I go.

39:54.125 --> 39:55.193
You should run.

39:55.226 --> 39:57.463
She should not, Luca.

39:59.498 --> 40:01.900
Thank you for believing in me.

40:01.933 --> 40:04.035
I always will.

40:04.069 --> 40:06.838
You're a good man.

40:15.814 --> 40:17.883
Call your sister.

40:31.663 --> 40:32.864
ABBY: Luca.
Abby.

40:32.898 --> 40:34.132
Where are you?
Why haven't you...

40:34.165 --> 40:35.701
We need to talk.

40:38.837 --> 40:41.473
Assuming I'm free to go.

40:41.507 --> 40:43.041
You are, Paulina.

40:43.074 --> 40:44.776
Aren't you
forgetting something?

40:44.810 --> 40:47.713
Don't think so.

40:47.746 --> 40:50.816
Hmm

40:50.849 --> 40:51.817
There she is.

40:51.850 --> 40:53.852
She is coming with me.

40:57.856 --> 40:59.791
PRIDE:
Uh, hold up.

40:59.825 --> 41:01.126
Uh, might be
a slight misunderstanding.

41:01.159 --> 41:02.894
She can't go with you just yet.

41:02.928 --> 41:03.629
DoD needs to debrief her.

41:03.662 --> 41:05.897
Could take a
couple of months,

41:05.931 --> 41:07.533
maybe longer.

41:07.566 --> 41:09.134
You know how
bureaucracy is.

41:09.167 --> 41:12.170
I won't even pretend
to be surprised, Dwayne.

41:13.572 --> 41:15.206
Well...

41:15.240 --> 41:16.875
Until next time.

41:22.280 --> 41:23.715
What she just say?

41:23.749 --> 41:25.917
I don't know.
She was whispering.

41:25.951 --> 41:28.920
Don't look at me.
I don't speak Russian.

41:30.756 --> 41:32.524
Thank you.

41:32.558 --> 41:35.761
Sonja's gonna get you up to DC.

41:36.962 --> 41:39.831
Meet with Special Agent Gibbs.

41:39.865 --> 41:41.533
Stay out of trouble.

41:47.973 --> 41:50.141
Huh. Gibbs.

41:51.743 --> 41:53.111
Nice of you to call.

41:53.144 --> 41:54.680
D-Man.

41:54.713 --> 41:56.114
Good job on Jenner Blye.

41:56.147 --> 41:58.249
Team effort, yours and mine.

41:58.283 --> 42:00.118
Just like that Miami op?

42:00.151 --> 42:02.854
Well, little less paperwork.

42:02.888 --> 42:05.023
Any luck tracking the Manta Ray?

42:05.056 --> 42:07.893
Well, I hear it's about
to hit an iceberg.

42:07.926 --> 42:09.294
Good.

42:09.327 --> 42:11.329
Didn't even cause
an international incident.

42:11.362 --> 42:13.298
Unlike the Miami op.

42:13.331 --> 42:14.900
Until next time.
