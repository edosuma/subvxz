CHRIS ROCK:
The holiday break was my
favorite time of the year.

00:07.475 --> 00:09.443
Two weeks of complete
freedom from school.

00:09.477 --> 00:12.413
No assignments and no homework.

00:12.446 --> 00:16.784
This year, my holiday gift
to you is a homework assignment.

00:16.817 --> 00:19.120
I'm glad I didn't
get her anything.

00:19.153 --> 00:21.455
Don't fret. This will be fun.

00:21.489 --> 00:24.492
Your assignment is to help
someone in need

00:24.525 --> 00:26.294
and give back to your community.

00:26.327 --> 00:28.462
I'm on vacation. Call Oprah.

00:28.496 --> 00:30.331
Oh, I'm gonna do
what I do every Christmas

00:30.364 --> 00:31.399
at the old folks' home.

00:31.432 --> 00:32.533
What's that?

00:32.566 --> 00:34.402
Pose for pictures
dressed as baby Jesus.

00:34.435 --> 00:38.506
I posed for pictures
as big baby Jesus. R.I.P., ODB.

00:38.539 --> 00:40.108
So what are you
gonna do?

00:40.141 --> 00:41.142
I don't know--
something quick

00:41.175 --> 00:43.111
so I can enjoy my vacation.

00:43.144 --> 00:45.813
Chris, what are
you gonna do?

00:45.846 --> 00:48.449
I don't know.
Maybe work at a soup kitchen.

00:48.482 --> 00:49.783
Oh, that's so nice.

00:49.817 --> 00:51.385
Oh, but the only thing is

00:51.419 --> 00:53.121
I don't think there's one
in my neighborhood.

00:53.154 --> 00:54.388
Oh, yes, there is.

00:55.889 --> 00:57.391
:
And could you give this

00:57.425 --> 01:00.294
back to Robert,
the manager?

01:00.328 --> 01:04.098
He dropped it in
sixth period study hall.

01:04.132 --> 01:06.367
Sure he did.

01:08.269 --> 01:09.270
Thanks, man.

01:09.303 --> 01:10.371
Come get some soup?

01:10.404 --> 01:11.705
Oh, no. Actually,
I'm here to volunteer.

01:11.739 --> 01:13.374
I got plenty of volunteers.

01:13.407 --> 01:15.509
This time of year,
everybody wants to give back.

01:15.543 --> 01:17.411
But I'm doing this
for a school assignment.

01:17.445 --> 01:18.446
You got any suggestions?

01:18.479 --> 01:19.680
I don't know, man.

01:19.713 --> 01:21.349
White people take all
the volunteer jobs

01:21.382 --> 01:22.816
at the soup kitchen.

01:22.850 --> 01:24.685
If they really wanted
to help the hungry,

01:24.718 --> 01:26.620
they'd volunteer
at the meat kitchen.

01:26.654 --> 01:27.655
Hey, Kill Moves.

01:27.688 --> 01:28.656
You waiting for soup?

01:28.689 --> 01:30.258
This a soup line?

01:30.291 --> 01:32.160
I was waiting to sit
on Santa's lap.

01:32.193 --> 01:34.262
Well, what do you want
Santa to give you?

01:34.295 --> 01:38.532
300 issues of Jet magazine,
a solid gold football helmet

01:38.566 --> 01:41.469
and an Ionic Breeze
air purifier.

01:41.502 --> 01:43.804
That last thing hadn't even
been invented yet.

01:43.837 --> 01:44.638
Anything else?

01:44.672 --> 01:48.476
A Christmas present
for my mother.

01:48.509 --> 01:50.478
Really?

01:50.511 --> 01:51.812
I can help you with that.

01:51.845 --> 01:53.547
This was
the perfect opportunity

01:53.581 --> 01:55.416
to get rid of my school
assignment,

01:55.449 --> 01:56.884
and it was the daily double;

01:56.917 --> 01:59.553
I got to help a homeless
person and a crazy person

01:59.587 --> 02:00.654
at the same time.

02:09.563 --> 02:11.165
* Ah, make it funky now.

CHRIS ROCK:
Christmas was my mother's
favorite time of year.

02:36.457 --> 02:38.592
She loved the food.

02:38.626 --> 02:41.195
And she loved the decorations.

02:41.229 --> 02:43.631
My father, on the other hand,
hated Christmas.

02:43.664 --> 02:45.199
He hated the food.

02:45.233 --> 02:47.335
I need to go
grocery shopping.

02:49.803 --> 02:51.572
And he hated the decorations.

02:51.605 --> 02:52.773
We need decorations.

02:56.510 --> 02:57.445
What's wrong, Julius?

02:57.478 --> 03:00.448
Man, those papers are
heavy this time of year.

03:00.481 --> 03:01.582
Kills my back.

03:01.615 --> 03:03.417
What's going on
for the holidays?

03:03.451 --> 03:04.418
Not much.

03:04.452 --> 03:05.886
I didn't get my
Christmas bonus.

03:05.919 --> 03:07.388
It's gonna be tight.

03:07.421 --> 03:08.689
It's tight,
all right, man.

03:08.722 --> 03:10.291
I ain't got
this year, man.

03:10.324 --> 03:11.392
I'm not buying
no gifts,

03:11.425 --> 03:12.493
I'm not buying
no cards.

03:12.526 --> 03:14.362
I'm not even
calling nobody, man.

03:14.395 --> 03:15.563
Everybody getting
the same gift

03:15.596 --> 03:16.797
from me
this year-- hope.

03:16.830 --> 03:18.732
Hope I buy
them something.

03:18.766 --> 03:20.468
Thanks, Manny
Have a good one, man.

03:20.501 --> 03:21.769
Good luck, man.

03:21.802 --> 03:24.338
My father would have given us
the best Christmas he could

03:24.372 --> 03:26.006
until he found out
he had another option.

03:26.039 --> 03:27.941
Brothers and sisters,

03:27.975 --> 03:30.744
we need to stop
this Christmas racket.

03:30.778 --> 03:32.513
What's all this?

03:32.546 --> 03:34.515
What's this?
Come over here, brother.

03:34.548 --> 03:39.587
We encourage you
to celebrate Kwanzaa this year.

03:39.620 --> 03:40.988
And stop being a slave

03:41.021 --> 03:42.390
to consumerism.

03:42.423 --> 03:44.592
Free yourself of your
financial oppressors

03:44.625 --> 03:46.527
by giving African love.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.596
What's Kwanzaa?

03:48.629 --> 03:51.532
Kwanzaa is celebrated
the seven days after Christmas

03:51.565 --> 03:54.635
and emphasizes principles of
family, community and culture.

03:54.668 --> 03:57.004
This peaceful African holiday

03:57.037 --> 03:59.940
was the great idea
of Dr. Malauna Karenga

03:59.973 --> 04:02.910
Later, one of his bad ideas
led him to prison for four years

04:02.943 --> 04:05.513
for felonious assault
and false imprisonment.

04:05.546 --> 04:07.681
Although Kwanzaa has enjoyed
limited success,

04:07.715 --> 04:09.550
felonious assault
swept the nation

04:09.583 --> 04:10.551
and continues to thrive

04:10.584 --> 04:12.620
throughout the African-American
community today.

04:15.323 --> 04:16.990
Well, are there presents?

04:17.024 --> 04:19.427
Yeah, but they should
come from the Earth.

04:19.460 --> 04:21.295
Like diamonds?
No.

04:21.329 --> 04:22.596
Well, they're
from the Earth

04:22.630 --> 04:24.598
and they're from Africa.

04:24.632 --> 04:26.700
Look, that may be true,
but I'm talking about

04:26.734 --> 04:27.668
crops and fruits and vegetables.

04:27.701 --> 04:29.970
What comes from the Earth
in Bed-Stuy

04:30.003 --> 04:32.473
are cigarette butts
and crack vials.

04:32.506 --> 04:34.642
But we want toys,
right, Chris?

04:34.675 --> 04:36.644
Doesn't make much
difference to me.

04:36.677 --> 04:38.546
I haven't gotten a present
in four years.

04:38.579 --> 04:40.814
Maybe this year
I can get some fruit.

04:40.848 --> 04:42.650
Judging from my luck
during past holidays,

04:42.683 --> 04:44.618
I'll be getting some pits.

04:46.654 --> 04:48.589
Julius, can I ask you
a question?

04:48.622 --> 04:49.990
Shoot.

04:50.023 --> 04:52.693
Are you doing Kwanzaa
'cause it's cheap?

04:52.726 --> 04:54.762
Yes!
No.

04:58.732 --> 05:00.100
Are you sure?

05:00.133 --> 05:01.535
No.

05:02.703 --> 05:03.771
Positive.

05:03.804 --> 05:06.574
I mean, we don't want our kids
growing up thinking

05:06.607 --> 05:09.477
holidays are all about
buying, buying, buying.

05:09.510 --> 05:10.344
There's more to life

05:10.378 --> 05:11.812
than just running
to the toy store.

05:15.583 --> 05:16.584
Okay.

05:16.617 --> 05:18.586
Mm... mwa!

05:18.619 --> 05:20.421
Happy Kwanzaa.

05:20.454 --> 05:22.656
While my family was
preparing for Kwanzaa,

05:22.690 --> 05:25.726
I was preparing to go shopping
with Kill Moves.

05:25.759 --> 05:27.861
I didn't know much about him
except that on Sunday mornings

05:27.895 --> 05:29.797
he directed traffic
in his underwear.

05:29.830 --> 05:31.365
Hey, Kill Moves.

05:31.399 --> 05:32.600
Merry...

05:32.633 --> 05:34.435
I thought you was
the mailman.

05:34.468 --> 05:36.404
I was gonna give him
this Christmas tip.

05:36.437 --> 05:37.438
Come on in.

05:39.907 --> 05:43.977
MAN :
When they get ready
to play on Sunday...

05:44.011 --> 05:44.978
You got cable?

05:45.012 --> 05:46.947
Can't miss Inside The NFL.

05:46.980 --> 05:49.750
I love Nick Buoniconti.

05:49.783 --> 05:51.719
So we looking for a gift
for your mother?

05:51.752 --> 05:52.786
No, it's actually
for your mother.

05:52.820 --> 05:55.456
Don't talk about
my mama!
I didn't mean
like that.

05:55.489 --> 05:56.824
That's okay.
I didn't hear you anyway.

05:56.857 --> 05:58.759
So what kinds of things
does your mother like?

05:58.792 --> 06:00.528
I don't know,

06:00.561 --> 06:03.130
but if it was your mother,
what would you get her?

06:03.163 --> 06:05.666
Diamonds and a white man.
Good choice.

06:05.699 --> 06:06.734
Okay, I don't think
we can buy that.

06:06.767 --> 06:08.869
But maybe chocolates?

06:08.902 --> 06:10.704
Sounds good.

06:10.738 --> 06:12.806
Good. So you got any money?

06:12.840 --> 06:15.843
Uh... just this.

06:19.847 --> 06:21.882
It's a bunch
of money in here!

06:21.915 --> 06:24.184
Where'd you get
all this?
In here.

06:24.217 --> 06:27.555
Okay. Well, let's go get
something for you mother.

06:27.588 --> 06:29.657
What crazy see, crazy do.

06:32.526 --> 06:33.561
Hey, Monica.

06:33.594 --> 06:35.563
Hey, Tonya. Cool hat.

06:35.596 --> 06:36.530
Merry Christmas.

06:36.564 --> 06:38.866
Oh, thanks, but you
didn't have to do this.

06:38.899 --> 06:39.900
Uh-huh.

06:39.933 --> 06:42.069
It's Christmas.

06:42.102 --> 06:43.804
Oh. Well, I have your gift.

06:43.837 --> 06:45.473
but I just...
I have to wrap it.

06:45.506 --> 06:46.474
That's cool.

06:46.507 --> 06:47.475
Hey, do you want

06:47.508 --> 06:49.810
to go Christmas caroling
with me and my cousins?

06:49.843 --> 06:52.145
Christmas caroling?
Black people

06:52.179 --> 06:53.814
No, my family's already
doing stuff,

06:53.847 --> 06:54.982
but we're doing it at home.

06:55.015 --> 06:57.184
Yeah. Bye.

06:57.217 --> 07:00.688
While Tonya wouldn't speak
about Kwanzaa,

07:00.721 --> 07:03.791
Drew was ready to start
speaking Swahili.

07:03.824 --> 07:06.494
The first principle
of Kwanzaa is umoja; unity.

07:06.527 --> 07:08.862
That means us black people
gotta stick together.

07:08.896 --> 07:10.163
Well, that's it for Kwanzaa.

07:10.197 --> 07:11.765
Come on, baby,
you're gonna miss it.

07:11.799 --> 07:14.735
Here. Here's your corn.

07:14.768 --> 07:16.704
What am I supposed
to do with this?

07:16.737 --> 07:19.206
You husk it, and then
we make hats out of it.

07:19.239 --> 07:21.709
You know, to keep the blue-eyed
demons out of our heads.

07:21.742 --> 07:23.744
Whatever.
Look, can I have some money

07:23.777 --> 07:26.113
to buy a Christmas present
for my friend Monica?

07:26.146 --> 07:28.882
Well, I'm afraid
that's not in accordance

07:28.916 --> 07:30.851
with the principles
of Kwanzaa.

07:30.884 --> 07:33.253
Or my father's cheapness.

07:33.286 --> 07:35.589
Well, she got me a gift,
so shouldn't I give one back?

07:35.623 --> 07:39.092
Absolutely. Here.
Give her this corn.

07:42.062 --> 07:43.797
You still got some money
left in here.

07:43.831 --> 07:45.065
You want it?

07:45.098 --> 07:46.734
No, thanks.

07:46.767 --> 07:49.002
Your mom's gonna love
those chocolates and the watch.

07:49.036 --> 07:50.270
I don't know.

07:50.303 --> 07:52.840
Are you sure this
is a good watch?

07:52.873 --> 07:54.174
Timex has a slogan.

07:54.207 --> 07:56.243
I never heard of a slogan
for Rolex.

07:56.276 --> 07:57.377
How about "It takes a lickin',

07:57.410 --> 08:00.113
and then you buy a new one
because you're rich"?

08:00.147 --> 08:01.549
Trust me, it's good.

08:01.582 --> 08:04.852
Anyway, thanks for your help.

08:04.885 --> 08:06.954
No problem. Merry Christmas.

08:06.987 --> 08:08.522
Happy Kwanzaa.

08:08.556 --> 08:09.723
And merry methadone.

08:09.757 --> 08:10.724
Say, listen,

08:10.758 --> 08:11.659
could you go with me tomorrow

08:11.692 --> 08:13.193
when I drop the gifts off
to her house?

08:13.226 --> 08:15.295
Sure. Where does she live?

08:15.328 --> 08:16.730
I don't know.

08:16.764 --> 08:18.098
I guess giving back
to the community

08:18.131 --> 08:19.867
wasn't goingto be
so quick and easy.

08:23.837 --> 08:25.005
I'll get it!

08:25.038 --> 08:26.940
CHRIS ROCK:
The hard thing about Kwanzaa

08:26.974 --> 08:28.542
was that everybody else
was celebrating Christmas.

08:28.576 --> 08:30.177
Even if you stayed
in the house,

08:30.210 --> 08:31.211
you couldn't escape it.

08:31.244 --> 08:32.279
Merry Christmas Eve.

08:32.312 --> 08:35.248
Hi, Greg. Uh, uh, come on in.

08:35.282 --> 08:37.317
Chris, Greg is here!

08:37.350 --> 08:38.786
I brought you
a Christmas gift.

08:38.819 --> 08:41.321
Thank you.
You didn't have to.

08:41.354 --> 08:45.225
Trivia fact:
those are his real ears.

08:45.258 --> 08:46.894
You didn't tell me
you'd be working

08:46.927 --> 08:48.128
as one of Santa's
elves this year.

08:48.161 --> 08:50.263
I'm not.
Oh.

08:50.297 --> 08:52.099
So where's your Christmas tree?

08:52.132 --> 08:54.267
We're celebrating Kwanzaa
this year.

08:54.301 --> 08:57.805
Happy Kwanzaa.

08:57.838 --> 08:58.806
Harambee!

08:58.839 --> 09:00.007
God bless you.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.009
Oh, beets!
These are my favorite!

09:02.042 --> 09:03.343
Lots of vitamin A.

09:03.376 --> 09:04.612
This was on my list.

09:04.645 --> 09:05.713
So what are you doing today?

09:05.746 --> 09:09.249
Well, I got to be back
at the North Pole by 11:00.

09:09.282 --> 09:10.851
But other than that, nothing.

09:10.884 --> 09:12.352
Good, 'cause I need your help.

09:12.385 --> 09:15.322
So we're gonna go through
some of your stuff

09:15.355 --> 09:17.357
and see if we can find
some clues to your
mother's whereabouts.

09:17.390 --> 09:19.226
We're going to point
to stuff and you're gonna
tell us what it is.

09:19.259 --> 09:20.728
Roger.

09:20.761 --> 09:21.929
You mean, yes?

09:21.962 --> 09:22.930
No, I mean Roger.

09:22.963 --> 09:24.097
You're pointing at Roger.

09:24.131 --> 09:26.867
That's the bear's name.

09:26.900 --> 09:29.870
And he finds pointing very rude.

09:29.903 --> 09:32.039
And he finds his owner
very crazy.

09:32.072 --> 09:34.374
I love Kwanzaa.

09:34.407 --> 09:36.744
Doesn't interfere
with Christmas

09:36.777 --> 09:39.346
and it's a good way
to bring the family together.

09:39.379 --> 09:42.182
You know, Christmas
is too materialistic.

09:42.215 --> 09:44.852
Yeah, well, my mom
made this for you.

09:44.885 --> 09:48.355
Ooh. Well, tell your mama
I said thank you.

09:49.923 --> 09:52.693
You know, I did
a little jail time

09:52.726 --> 09:54.361
with the guy
who invented Kwanzaa.

09:54.394 --> 09:56.163
Really?
Yeah!

09:56.196 --> 09:59.700
I won a hat just like this
from him in a card game.

09:59.733 --> 10:01.201
He was a good guy.

10:01.234 --> 10:03.003
If he hadn't committed
that felonious assault,

10:03.036 --> 10:05.338
Kwanzaa would have
caught on, been big.

10:05.372 --> 10:06.774
No, it wouldn't.

10:06.807 --> 10:08.308
Look, I got to go
in the back.

10:08.341 --> 10:09.777
Holler if you need something.

10:13.847 --> 10:16.917
She needed something.
She didn't holler.

10:18.218 --> 10:20.954
Well, I'll see you later, Doc.

10:22.823 --> 10:25.025
That's my CIA card from
the Bay of Pigs invasion.

10:25.058 --> 10:27.695
An address book.

10:27.728 --> 10:31.231
A piggy bank from the
1964 World's Fair.

10:31.264 --> 10:32.766
Wait, what
you just say?

10:32.800 --> 10:34.334
:
A piggy bank from the 19...

10:34.367 --> 10:36.804
No, no, you said this
is an address book.

10:39.940 --> 10:42.710
Mom.
Kathleen Devereaux.

10:42.743 --> 10:44.912
551 East 63 Street.

10:44.945 --> 10:45.846
Dude...

10:45.879 --> 10:48.749
that's on the Upper
East Side of Manhattan.

10:48.782 --> 10:50.183
Do you know what kind
of people live there?

10:50.217 --> 10:52.352
White people and Spike Lee.

10:54.955 --> 10:56.256
Why am I doing this?

10:56.289 --> 10:57.725
Well, if you're gonna
go see your mother,

10:57.758 --> 10:58.726
you gotta get cleaned up.

10:58.759 --> 11:00.828
All right. You're the elf.

11:01.929 --> 11:03.463
Cleaning up Kill Moves
was tougher

11:03.496 --> 11:05.799
than cleaning up
New Orleans after Katrina.

11:05.833 --> 11:07.434
Here! What
size you wear?

11:07.467 --> 11:09.302
650 long.

11:09.336 --> 11:11.104
All right.

11:11.138 --> 11:12.840
Uh... Oh, hey.

11:12.873 --> 11:14.775
Huh What
do you think?

11:14.808 --> 11:18.111
You have something
in a chartreuse?

11:18.145 --> 11:19.947
* Just a little bit...

11:19.980 --> 11:22.950
Stop moving around so much.

11:22.983 --> 11:24.284
Take it easy.
I'm tender-headed.

11:24.317 --> 11:25.285
Ow!

11:25.318 --> 11:27.020
After 15 bottles of shampoo

11:27.054 --> 11:30.490
and a Silkwood shower,
our job was complete.

11:30.523 --> 11:31.825
You're done.

11:31.859 --> 11:33.827
Ooh-ee.

11:33.861 --> 11:36.129
I look like a young
Cleavon Little.

11:36.163 --> 11:37.430
More like an old Clifton Davis.

11:37.464 --> 11:38.999
How much?

11:39.032 --> 11:41.969
Nothing. Just consider
it a Christmas gift.

11:42.002 --> 11:44.972
Hey, Slick, if you wasn't
a psychotic, homeless bum

11:45.005 --> 11:46.373
I'd go out with you.

11:46.406 --> 11:50.443
Get in line, sister.
Get in line.

11:50.477 --> 11:53.847
Since there was no "Kwanzaa
Eve" celebration for my family,

11:53.881 --> 11:56.984
Christmas Day turned
into just another Wednesday.

11:57.017 --> 11:58.318
Aren't there any
Kwanzaa shows on?

11:58.351 --> 12:00.954
Yeah. The Bob Hope
Kwanzaa Special.

12:00.988 --> 12:02.455
Everything is about Christmas.

12:02.489 --> 12:05.058
Our ancestors played
games and told stories.

12:05.092 --> 12:06.093
Because
our ancestors

12:06.126 --> 12:07.861
didn't have TV.

12:07.895 --> 12:08.896
See, that's Kwanzaa's
second principle,

12:08.929 --> 12:12.532
Kujichagulia--
self-determination.
Kuji

12:12.565 --> 12:15.002
We define ourselves.

12:15.035 --> 12:17.470
We don't need The Man
telling us what to watch.

12:17.504 --> 12:20.207
Do we have any
wrapping paper?

12:20.240 --> 12:22.175
We have Kwanzaa paper.

12:22.209 --> 12:23.343
Here you go. baby.

12:23.376 --> 12:24.444
Mr. Omar is outside.

12:24.477 --> 12:26.246
Oh. I'll get it.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.219
Merry Christmas, everybody!

12:32.252 --> 12:34.021
Let the yuletide ring!

12:34.054 --> 12:36.156
What is all this?

12:36.189 --> 12:39.893
Oh, the Widows'
Choir of Bed-Stuy.

12:39.927 --> 12:40.994
Hey, y'all.

12:41.028 --> 12:43.163
Hi.
Hey.
Hi.

12:43.196 --> 12:44.164
What's wrong with y'all?

12:44.197 --> 12:48.035
You look like the Grinch
stole your Christmas.

12:48.068 --> 12:49.903
We're not celebrating
Christmas this year.

12:49.937 --> 12:51.104
We're celebrating Kwanzaa.

12:51.138 --> 12:52.505
Yeah, we're tired
of being consumed

12:52.539 --> 12:56.076
by this capitalistic nation's
mindless consumerism.

12:56.109 --> 12:57.177
Tragic.

12:57.210 --> 12:58.812
Well, you won't
be needing this, then.

12:58.846 --> 12:59.980
Come on, ladies!

13:00.013 --> 13:02.149
Let's go and celebrate
some Christmas cheer.

13:06.920 --> 13:09.089
This has got to be wrong.

13:11.124 --> 13:12.993
Baby, welcome home.

13:13.026 --> 13:15.428
Hey, Mom, Merry Christmas.

13:17.097 --> 13:18.966
I guess this is it.

13:22.903 --> 13:25.072
Baby, it's so
good to see you.

13:25.105 --> 13:27.140
I've been
very worried.

13:27.174 --> 13:28.408
It's good to see
you, too, Mom.

13:28.441 --> 13:29.409
How have you been?

13:29.442 --> 13:30.410
Homeless.

13:30.443 --> 13:31.411
Other than that.

13:31.444 --> 13:33.947
Good. You know,
watching my diet.

13:33.981 --> 13:36.950
I get a lot of exercise, and
I don't talk to space people

13:36.984 --> 13:39.920
as much as I used to.
Except for Gazoo.

13:39.953 --> 13:41.421
Well, of course.

13:41.454 --> 13:42.455
And who are you?

13:42.489 --> 13:44.157
Oh, I'm Chris.

13:44.191 --> 13:46.093
Welcome to my
home, Chris.

13:46.126 --> 13:49.963
Wow. Looks like
a department store.

13:49.997 --> 13:53.366
Well, this is my
favorite time of year.

13:53.400 --> 13:55.102
I bought you
a Christmas present.

13:55.135 --> 13:56.136
Hmm.

13:59.006 --> 14:00.473
A watch.

14:04.477 --> 14:07.514
And...

14:07.547 --> 14:09.616
Turtles.

14:09.649 --> 14:12.219
Where did you
find turtles?!

14:12.252 --> 14:14.988
At the corner store.

14:15.022 --> 14:16.623
Didn't you see the Rolex?

14:16.656 --> 14:19.459
I have eight Rolexes,
but I haven't had a Turtle

14:19.492 --> 14:21.962
since I was a girl.

14:21.995 --> 14:24.131
This is very
sweet of you.
Thanks, Mom.

14:24.164 --> 14:25.632
Well, why don't you
put your coat down?

14:25.665 --> 14:29.002
Edgar, why don't you play
something for us on the piano?

14:29.036 --> 14:31.138
I want to talk to Chris
for a little while.

14:34.507 --> 14:37.144
Well, thank you for
bringing my boy home.

14:37.177 --> 14:39.346
He gets lost easily.

14:39.379 --> 14:40.948
Has he always
been like this?

14:40.981 --> 14:42.315
You mean "crazy"?

14:46.686 --> 14:47.988
Yeah.

14:48.021 --> 14:51.024
Oh, Edgar's always
been savant-like.

14:51.058 --> 14:52.192
As a little child,

14:52.225 --> 14:55.162
he had a talent
for charts, graphs,

14:55.195 --> 14:56.997
numbers and martial arts.

14:57.030 --> 14:58.131
Really?

14:58.165 --> 15:01.368
Edgar? What is the
square root of pi?

15:01.401 --> 15:05.172
1.77245385.

15:05.205 --> 15:07.207
I knew that.

15:07.240 --> 15:10.610
Until a few years ago,
he wa functioning semi-normally

15:10.643 --> 15:11.945
as an air traffic controller.

15:11.979 --> 15:12.946
What happened?

15:15.415 --> 15:17.184
Ronald Reagan.

15:17.217 --> 15:18.952
He fired us all.

15:18.986 --> 15:22.255
That sent me on
a downward spiral

15:22.289 --> 15:23.656
of paranoia,
schizophrenia...

15:23.690 --> 15:24.724
Reagan, too.

15:24.757 --> 15:25.692
I took to wandering

15:25.725 --> 15:28.361
the streets until I met
Gazoo, the space man,

15:28.395 --> 15:30.263
He told me that the
only true freedom

15:30.297 --> 15:32.265
could be found by
living in a box.

15:32.299 --> 15:34.367
Gazoo?

15:34.401 --> 15:36.536
From The Flintstones.

15:38.538 --> 15:40.407
Later Christmas day,
my family got a visit

15:40.440 --> 15:44.077
from the Ghost
of Shoplifting Present.

15:44.111 --> 15:45.345
Oh, yes?
Hi.

15:45.378 --> 15:47.214
I'm Monica's mother--
Tonya's friend.

15:47.247 --> 15:50.717
Oh, hi. How can I help you?

15:50.750 --> 15:52.419
I came to return this
gift Tonya gave her.

15:52.452 --> 15:54.054
It's too
expensive.

15:54.087 --> 15:57.057
It has to cost
like $30 or $40

15:57.090 --> 16:00.093
Oh, well, I
completely understand.

16:00.127 --> 16:01.328
Wait a minute.

16:04.131 --> 16:05.165
Would you like

16:05.198 --> 16:07.234
some beets?

16:07.267 --> 16:08.701
Why, thank you.

16:08.735 --> 16:09.769
Merry Christmas.

16:09.802 --> 16:11.571
Thank you.

16:11.604 --> 16:15.575
And a Happy Kwanzaa
to you as well.

16:15.608 --> 16:18.311
That look means, "I don't know
what the hell is going on,

16:18.345 --> 16:20.513
but I'm about to find out."

16:23.683 --> 16:24.717
Where'd you get this?

16:24.751 --> 16:27.387
Doc's store.

16:27.420 --> 16:28.555
Where'd you get the money?

16:30.457 --> 16:32.125
You did have
the money, didn't you?

16:32.159 --> 16:35.262
Monica got me
a Christmas present

16:35.295 --> 16:37.297
and I didn't
have one to give back, so...

16:37.330 --> 16:38.298
I took it.

16:38.331 --> 16:39.299
You took it.

16:39.332 --> 16:41.468
You mean you stole it.

16:41.501 --> 16:42.269
I'm sorry.

16:42.302 --> 16:43.736
Oh, you're gonna
be sorry.

16:43.770 --> 16:45.572
But first, you're
gonna take this

16:45.605 --> 16:46.806
back to Doc's
and you're gonna

16:46.839 --> 16:48.041
tell him what you did.

16:48.075 --> 16:49.342
Am I in trouble?

16:49.376 --> 16:54.281
Girl, you better be lucky
it's the holidays.

16:54.314 --> 16:56.749
Happy Kwanzaa.

16:56.783 --> 17:00.287
Nice to see you again, Mom,
but I gotta get home

17:00.320 --> 17:03.290
before somebody
moves into my box.

17:03.323 --> 17:06.293
I want you to keep
in touch this time.

17:06.326 --> 17:08.595
I will. I'll call you
from the phone in my head.

17:08.628 --> 17:10.497
Great. Chris,
this is my number.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.465
Will you call me from
the phone in your house

17:12.499 --> 17:14.067
and let me know
how he's doing?

17:14.101 --> 17:15.235
Yes.

17:15.268 --> 17:17.170
I appreciate that.

17:17.204 --> 17:18.638
You still have the
suitcase I gave you?

17:18.671 --> 17:19.439
Yes, ma'am.

17:19.472 --> 17:21.441
Well, is there
anything left in it?

17:21.474 --> 17:22.342
No, ma'am, it's empty.

17:22.375 --> 17:23.510
Well.

17:23.543 --> 17:25.078
Here's another.

17:27.347 --> 17:28.315
Thank you.

17:28.348 --> 17:30.517
And thank you, Chris.

17:30.550 --> 17:34.087
It's nice to know that
Edgar has a friend.

17:34.121 --> 17:35.788
Yeah. He's a
good friend, too.

17:35.822 --> 17:37.490
Bye, Mom.
Merry Christmas.

17:37.524 --> 17:39.126
My assignment was
to give something

17:39.159 --> 17:40.127
back to the community,

17:40.160 --> 17:42.529
and I didn't think
I had anything to give,

17:42.562 --> 17:45.665
but that's only because you
can't buy a friend at a store.

17:45.698 --> 17:49.169
Finding out that Kill Moves's
mother was a rich socialite

17:49.202 --> 17:51.404
should've been the biggest
surprise I had that day,

17:51.438 --> 17:52.405
but it wasn't.

17:52.439 --> 17:54.641
What's in there anyway?

17:54.674 --> 17:55.875
Same as last time.

17:55.908 --> 17:57.177
You want some?

17:57.210 --> 17:58.245
I can't eat it all.

17:59.379 --> 18:00.513
No, thanks.

18:00.547 --> 18:05.218
Well, at least
take this, uh...

18:05.252 --> 18:07.854
holiday card.

18:07.887 --> 18:08.855
Thanks.

18:08.888 --> 18:10.157
Merry Christmas.

18:10.190 --> 18:11.458
Merry Christmas, Chris.

18:11.491 --> 18:13.393
CAROLERS:
* We wish you
a merry Christmas *

18:13.426 --> 18:15.895
* We wish you
a merry Christmas *

18:15.928 --> 18:17.797
* And a happy new year

18:17.830 --> 18:22.235
* Good tidings we bring
to you and your friends *

18:22.269 --> 18:23.770
* We wish you
a merry Christmas *

18:23.803 --> 18:26.173
* And a happy new year...

18:26.206 --> 18:27.174
Rochelle.

18:27.207 --> 18:28.308
What's wrong?

18:28.341 --> 18:30.810
This is the just
worst holiday ever.

18:30.843 --> 18:34.181
Chris isn't home,
Tonya's stealing

18:34.214 --> 18:36.549
and Drew claims he's never gonna
talk to white people again.

18:36.583 --> 18:38.518
Years later, Drew
married a white woman.

18:38.551 --> 18:40.253
but every Christmas,
he ignores her

18:40.287 --> 18:41.788
I'm sorry, baby.

18:41.821 --> 18:44.424
Kwanzaa seemed
like a good idea.

18:44.457 --> 18:46.326
That's okay. We'll celebrate
Kwanzaa this time,

18:46.359 --> 18:48.361
but next year
we're having Christmas.

18:50.297 --> 18:51.431
I have a confession to make.

18:52.632 --> 18:53.733
What?

18:53.766 --> 18:56.403
Well, the reason we're not

18:56.436 --> 18:59.406
celebrating Christmas
this year is...

18:59.439 --> 19:00.707
I didn't get my bonus,

19:02.975 --> 19:04.211
I knew it!

19:04.244 --> 19:05.345
I knew it.

19:05.378 --> 19:07.514
You always choose cheap
over the truth.

19:07.547 --> 19:09.582
Why didn't you tell me you
didn't have any money?

19:09.616 --> 19:11.818
Well, I didn't want to
disappoint you, baby.

19:11.851 --> 19:15.388
Julius, we have been
15 years, three kids...

19:15.422 --> 19:17.290
And a partridge in a pear tree.

19:17.324 --> 19:19.592
I know you better
than you know yourself.

19:19.626 --> 19:22.695
Okay, fine. We just gotta
figure out a way to fix this.

19:22.729 --> 19:25.198
Kwanzaa had been
a disaster at my house,

19:25.232 --> 19:27.567
but at least Kill Moves
had a good Christmas.

19:27.600 --> 19:30.503
Then, just when I thought
I had nothing left to give,

19:30.537 --> 19:33.506
Hey! Happy holidays, 'lil dude.

19:33.540 --> 19:34.541
Let me hold a dollar.

19:34.574 --> 19:35.908
I don't have any money.

19:35.942 --> 19:37.510
But... I do have
this Christmas card.

19:39.812 --> 19:40.880
Thanks.

19:40.913 --> 19:41.948
You owe me a dollar.

19:41.981 --> 19:43.316
Merry Christmas.

19:43.350 --> 19:44.951
Even though Christmas
had passed,

19:44.984 --> 19:47.587
my parents wanted to let some
of our old traditions live.

19:47.620 --> 19:49.622
What's going on?

19:49.656 --> 19:50.823
BOTH:
Merry Christmas!

19:52.892 --> 19:56.929
Fortunately, one of the day-
after-Christmas traditions

19:56.963 --> 19:58.665
is that everything is 75% off.

19:58.698 --> 20:03.336
Kill Moves and his mother
taught me a valuable lesson--

20:03.370 --> 20:04.504
No matter what you celebrate,

20:04.537 --> 20:08.007
the holidays should be spent
with people you love.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.942
Thanks for that two
grand, 'lil dude.

20:09.976 --> 20:11.811
What two grand?

20:11.844 --> 20:13.813
It was in that Christmas
card you gave me.

20:13.846 --> 20:14.814
What?

20:14.847 --> 20:16.483
Yeah. In the
spirit of Christmas,

20:16.516 --> 20:19.619
I'm-a give you a dollar.

20:19.652 --> 20:21.554
You got change
for a hundred?

20:21.588 --> 20:24.591
