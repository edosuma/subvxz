WEBVTT

00:04.352 --> 00:05.483
Previously on
SEAL Team...

00:05.527 --> 00:06.876
I'm sorry about Leanne
and Hannah.

00:06.919 --> 00:08.617
You're part of the reason
that Hannah left.

00:08.660 --> 00:10.097
If you're flailing around
looking for somebody to blame,

00:10.140 --> 00:12.099
why don't you check
the fucking mirror for once?

00:12.142 --> 00:14.884
You think this nuclear program
is already up and running?

00:14.927 --> 00:17.104
There's more at stake down here
than any of us imagined.

00:18.105 --> 00:20.063
Might have to hit the pause
button on our project

00:20.107 --> 00:22.674
-while I'm gone.
-At least you can have some time
to decide

00:22.718 --> 00:24.807
if the side hustle
is a passion project

00:24.850 --> 00:27.027
or a distraction
from problems at work.

00:27.070 --> 00:28.332
Your head is not right,

00:28.376 --> 00:29.768
-and it hasn't been for months.
-You want

00:29.812 --> 00:31.596
to know what's fucking
dangerous? Threatening

00:31.640 --> 00:32.902
the team leader.
Fuckin' warning.

00:32.945 --> 00:34.425
CLAY:
This how we operate

00:34.469 --> 00:36.079
-the rest of the trip?
-Doesn't feel good

00:36.123 --> 00:38.038
going behind his back, but
I don't see we have any other

00:38.081 --> 00:39.735
option for protecting it.

00:44.348 --> 00:47.221
♪ Yeah!♪

00:47.264 --> 00:48.526
SONNY:
Ugh.

00:48.570 --> 00:50.050
JASON:
You got to be kidding me, man.

00:50.093 --> 00:51.616
Two weeks, and you're still shit
at this game, Sonny.

00:51.660 --> 00:53.966
[laughing]
You can't get in my head, man.

00:54.010 --> 00:55.794
There's nothing but space
in your head.

00:55.838 --> 00:57.535
You really must get sick
and tired of me

00:57.579 --> 00:59.711
beating you like a rented mule.

00:59.755 --> 01:01.583
You're out of your damn mind.
I beat you Tuesday,

01:01.626 --> 01:03.106
-I beat you Wednesday.
-Uh-uh. What?

01:03.150 --> 01:05.108
-What day is it now?
-Well, we've been sitting

01:05.152 --> 01:07.197
on our asses for, what,
16 days now, Davis?

01:07.241 --> 01:09.721
Yeah, 16 days.

01:09.765 --> 01:12.811
Look, now that we know
the dead Colectivos were exposed

01:12.855 --> 01:15.510
to uranium-235, I am just
waiting on intel from Smith

01:15.553 --> 01:18.121
so I can figure out where the
Venezuelans are enriching it.

01:18.165 --> 01:19.818
Tell you, why don't you just
play me this game

01:19.862 --> 01:22.386
so my greatness will rub off on
you, and we'll get some answers?

01:22.430 --> 01:24.693
I don't want to embarrass you,
but those two-- they could

01:24.736 --> 01:26.173
probably use a break
from rearranging

01:26.216 --> 01:28.479
-the fire-watch schedule.
-What? The Bobbsey Twins?

01:28.523 --> 01:29.828
Yeah, they need
to get the stick

01:29.872 --> 01:31.743
out of their asses,
if you ask me.

01:32.614 --> 01:34.224
Oh. Yee-haw. I win.

01:34.268 --> 01:36.835
The whole point of the game is
to get the rock in the hole,

01:36.879 --> 01:38.620
not blow it up, Sonny.

01:38.663 --> 01:41.231
Well, what's the fun of that?

01:42.189 --> 01:43.755
Boom!

01:46.410 --> 01:48.543
Hey, you know what I've noticed?

01:48.586 --> 01:51.633
All of my shifts,
either on watch or leave,

01:51.676 --> 01:53.200
now line up with one of you two.

01:53.243 --> 01:54.505
You want to explain that?

01:54.549 --> 01:55.767
Just managing the workload,
brother.

01:55.811 --> 01:57.813
Bullshit.
Both of you are looking

01:57.856 --> 01:59.293
for ways to look over
my shoulder, isn't that it?

01:59.336 --> 02:00.990
-It's not like that.
-It's not like that?

02:01.033 --> 02:02.426
If you don't think
I can lead this team,

02:02.470 --> 02:04.559
you tell it to my face
right now, Ray. Go ahead.

02:04.602 --> 02:06.648
Tell it to my face.

02:06.691 --> 02:08.693
-Straight up.
-[sighs]

02:08.737 --> 02:12.958
What? He get in your ear,
you listen to him?

02:13.002 --> 02:14.482
-We're just watching your back.
-Yeah.

02:14.525 --> 02:16.527
While sharpening your knives.

02:16.571 --> 02:17.833
After everything
we've been through,

02:17.876 --> 02:20.183
you trust
that little shit more than me?

02:20.227 --> 02:25.319
Jace, look, man, it's killing me
to say this, but...

02:25.362 --> 02:28.017
you're compromised, man, and
you're putting the team at risk.

02:28.060 --> 02:30.802
Because this guy here--
he's still bitching

02:30.846 --> 02:32.804
about the probe in North Korea?

02:32.848 --> 02:34.284
-No.
-No?

02:34.328 --> 02:37.113
Because you brought that
building down on us in Mali.

02:37.157 --> 02:38.201
Did not. Bullshit.

02:38.245 --> 02:40.377
Enemy did that,
and you know that.

02:41.204 --> 02:44.860
You and I found an EOD hazard
when we were clearing.

02:46.122 --> 02:49.038
Told me to mark it,
and then you forgot, right?

02:49.081 --> 02:51.606
You had the GIGN just
set a charge right on it.

02:54.348 --> 02:56.524
Just want what's best for you
and for the team, brother.

02:56.567 --> 02:59.527
I'm what's best for this team.
I'm what's best for this team!

02:59.570 --> 03:01.572
What, are you gonna go
to Command?

03:01.616 --> 03:03.357
-No.
-It's obvious to me

03:03.400 --> 03:07.099
that loyalty and brotherhood
are just words to you.

03:08.318 --> 03:10.581
You're both a disgrace
to the Trident. Both of you.

03:15.282 --> 03:17.545
♪

03:29.383 --> 03:31.776
Hey, how about, uh, how 'bout
you and I go check out

03:31.820 --> 03:35.084
the diving in Santa Marta
when Brock gets back?

03:35.127 --> 03:37.086
I was supposed to link up with
Jason to blow off some steam,

03:37.129 --> 03:41.264
but his, uh, watch schedule
was conveniently swapped.

03:43.092 --> 03:44.833
Means that you and I get
to hit the reset button

03:44.876 --> 03:47.096
and hang, like old times.

03:47.139 --> 03:50.708
Yeah, look, man, I know you
think you're a great substitute

03:50.752 --> 03:54.146
for Bravo 1, but you ain't.

03:56.323 --> 03:59.282
Think I'm gonna go in search
of, uh,

03:59.326 --> 04:01.458
Pablo's hippos.

04:05.288 --> 04:07.029
Where's Sonny off to?

04:07.072 --> 04:09.945
I don't know,
but it's nowhere good.

04:09.988 --> 04:14.036
Yeah, well,
we got bigger fish to fry.

04:14.079 --> 04:16.168
We need to try
and talk to Jason again.

04:16.212 --> 04:18.170
The Omega has proven
that I can divide the team,

04:18.214 --> 04:20.129
not hold it together.

04:21.435 --> 04:23.785
It's gonna be on you
to show Jason the light.

04:25.003 --> 04:28.703
Coming to Colombia thinking
I could keep an eye on everyone,

04:28.746 --> 04:31.227
over being with my son.

04:31.271 --> 04:33.447
Must be out
of my goddamn mind.

04:34.317 --> 04:39.540
You made that decision,
as hard as it was, for Jason.

04:39.583 --> 04:40.976
So don't abandon him now.

04:41.019 --> 04:43.326
Abandon him?

04:45.285 --> 04:48.418
Well, best-case scenario,
he boots me off Bravo.

04:48.462 --> 04:51.247
Worst case, he's got me sleeping
with one eye open.

04:51.291 --> 04:54.381
Man thinks he's losing the job
he loves most. He...

04:54.424 --> 04:55.947
He's terrified.

04:55.991 --> 04:58.167
A wounded animal is
the most dangerous.

04:58.210 --> 05:00.996
Yeah, especially to himself.

05:01.039 --> 05:03.868
Which is why
we have to make him understand

05:03.912 --> 05:06.044
that we're on his side.

05:06.088 --> 05:08.830
Outside the wire and in.

05:30.025 --> 05:34.334
Jace... what are you doing?

05:35.813 --> 05:38.686
Hey, we're here to work
this problem with you, boss.

05:38.729 --> 05:40.775
20 years of combat,

05:40.818 --> 05:42.646
and all the ways
I could've gone out.

05:42.690 --> 05:46.258
Command taking my bird is
the worst way it could end.

05:46.302 --> 05:48.391
Jason, no one's going
to Command, all right?

05:48.435 --> 05:50.001
So put the gun down
and let's talk.

05:50.045 --> 05:51.829
You know, the doctor in Germany,

05:51.873 --> 05:55.572
the fucking doctor in Germany
told me I was at risk for TBI.

05:55.616 --> 05:57.400
Wanted to run more tests.

05:57.444 --> 05:59.489
-More fucking tests.
-Well, did you?

05:59.533 --> 06:01.839
You know, I knew the combat
was catching up to me.

06:01.883 --> 06:03.363
You know, I felt it.

06:05.408 --> 06:08.455
I had memory loss,
I forgot things, it got spotty.

06:12.676 --> 06:16.593
Putting all of Bravo...

06:16.637 --> 06:18.682
in the hospital and...

06:18.726 --> 06:21.206
when I am supposed to be
leading my brothers, right?

06:21.250 --> 06:22.730
Supposed
to be leading my brothers,

06:22.773 --> 06:24.645
protecting my brothers.

06:24.688 --> 06:26.690
Brotherhood, loyalty-- it...

06:26.734 --> 06:29.214
it means the rest of us step up
to support you.

06:31.434 --> 06:34.394
All the shit
that I have seen in war,

06:34.437 --> 06:37.484
one thing
that scares me the most

06:37.527 --> 06:39.790
is becoming
as broken as Swanny.

06:39.834 --> 06:42.053
That's what scares me the most.

06:42.097 --> 06:44.186
CLAY:
Science moves fast.

06:44.229 --> 06:46.275
There's a breakthrough
around the corner.

06:47.668 --> 06:51.149
Swanny hadn't given up, he could
be in a study right now.

06:51.193 --> 06:53.151
There's a lot of promising
options out there, man.

06:53.195 --> 06:55.719
There's gene therapies,
psychedelics,

06:55.763 --> 06:58.896
magnetic e-resonance,
hydrogels. I mean, there...

06:58.940 --> 07:00.898
I did not sign up
to become a lab rat.

07:00.942 --> 07:02.683
-You understand?
-Jace,

07:02.726 --> 07:04.641
let us have your back
for the rest of the Omega,

07:04.685 --> 07:08.166
all right, the way
you've always had ours.

07:08.210 --> 07:10.952
When we're home, I'll help you
find a way forward.

07:10.995 --> 07:14.651
Hey, never out of the fight.

07:14.695 --> 07:18.263
Propped up and pitied.
Propped up and fucking pitied

07:18.307 --> 07:21.136
by the guys
that I'm supposed to lead.

07:21.179 --> 07:24.356
You give me no choice.

07:26.228 --> 07:29.405
I'm going out on my shield
on my terms.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.451
Fuck.

07:38.501 --> 07:40.416
Jace?

07:40.460 --> 07:42.462
Yo.

07:43.811 --> 07:45.769
Hey.

07:45.813 --> 07:48.337
I told you to leave me alone.

07:50.078 --> 07:52.776
[sighs]
Last night was a rough one, huh?

07:52.820 --> 07:56.519
[exhales sharply]
You think?

07:56.563 --> 07:58.216
Yeah, well, acknowledging

07:58.260 --> 08:01.872
you have a problem
is the hardest step, believe me.

08:01.916 --> 08:03.918
Shut up.

08:03.961 --> 08:06.398
And you did that, man.

08:06.442 --> 08:09.314
Now we just got to figure out
what to do about it.

08:09.358 --> 08:11.447
[sighs]

08:11.491 --> 08:13.841
Already told you what
I'm doing next, Ray, all right?

08:13.884 --> 08:17.366
Going out on your shield, man--
that-that was the shock talking.

08:17.409 --> 08:19.760
Look, I wrote a letter
to Mikey and Emma.

08:19.803 --> 08:22.545
Left it in the cages.
Make sure they get it, okay?

08:22.589 --> 08:26.070
You-you wrote a letter
before we came out here?

08:26.114 --> 08:29.247
You didn't think you'd make it
off the battlefield?

08:31.032 --> 08:32.990
[laughs]
You expect me to do nothing

08:33.034 --> 08:34.818
after what you did for me?

08:34.862 --> 08:39.214
I expect you to shut the fuck up
and get the fuck out of here.

08:39.257 --> 08:40.737
Well, you know what, Jace?

08:40.781 --> 08:43.044
That's the one thing
that I can't do.

08:43.871 --> 08:46.308
You are my brother, Jason.

08:47.701 --> 08:49.180
There's no man left behind.

08:49.224 --> 08:51.356
PTS is treatable, man,
and I'm really glad

08:51.400 --> 08:53.881
that you're on that path,
and you-you've done that,

08:53.924 --> 08:56.318
but I'm telling you,

08:56.361 --> 08:58.799
I got to get out...

08:58.842 --> 09:01.932
before I get worse.
You understand?

09:03.847 --> 09:06.763
Let's take a drive, hmm?

09:06.807 --> 09:08.896
Change of scenery.

09:10.680 --> 09:12.552
Let's get you
a breakfast burrito.

09:12.595 --> 09:14.815
You love breakfast burritos.

09:18.514 --> 09:20.472
You're not gonna
leave me alone, are you?

09:20.516 --> 09:22.953
No, I am not.

09:26.087 --> 09:27.958
If I go,

09:28.002 --> 09:30.265
do not talk to me,
you understand me?

09:30.308 --> 09:32.528
My head cannot take it.

09:35.313 --> 09:37.794
Won't say a word.

09:41.668 --> 09:43.670
SMITH:
Bet you didn't expect
such a haul

09:43.713 --> 09:45.933
when you requested
these files, Davis.

09:45.976 --> 09:47.674
Yeah.

09:51.242 --> 09:53.201
Couple more out there.

09:53.244 --> 09:54.637
What is all this?

09:54.681 --> 09:56.987
Hard copy of truck routes out
of ports

09:57.031 --> 09:59.294
in Venezuela
over the past six months.

09:59.337 --> 10:01.992
My plan is to cross-reference
the delivery manifests

10:02.036 --> 10:05.517
with the Colectivos' GPS data,
look for any materials

10:05.561 --> 10:07.868
that could be used
in nuclear enrichment.

10:07.911 --> 10:10.653
You couldn't farm this out
to someone back at Langley?

10:10.697 --> 10:12.655
Well, I came here
to prove myself.

10:12.699 --> 10:15.397
Delegating hunches
doesn't seem right.

10:16.746 --> 10:20.184
I don't know if my being here's
even been worth it, but...

10:20.228 --> 10:22.012
How you holding up?

10:23.013 --> 10:25.363
I'm having my doubts, too.

10:27.975 --> 10:30.151
Hey, do you have any idea
where Sonny went?

10:30.194 --> 10:33.633
He mostly communicates to me
with dirty looks lately, so...

10:33.676 --> 10:35.417
Why? You worried about him?

10:36.287 --> 10:40.074
Yeah, I, um... I've seen him
in some pretty dark places.

10:40.117 --> 10:43.643
Just something feels different
this time.

10:44.513 --> 10:47.037
Okay, now I'm worried about him.

10:49.779 --> 10:52.303
-What are you doing?
-Pinging his phone.

10:55.959 --> 10:59.006
He's in Dibulla.
It's-it's a rough area.

10:59.049 --> 11:00.268
It's totally off-limits.

11:01.138 --> 11:03.401
CLAY:
I'm gonna go check up on him

11:03.445 --> 11:05.926
and make sure
he's staying under the radar.

11:05.969 --> 11:08.319
He's lucky to have a friend
like you.

11:08.363 --> 11:10.626
They all are.

11:21.376 --> 11:23.508
You better be stopped

11:23.552 --> 11:25.859
because that burrito's
working through you.

11:25.902 --> 11:29.514
Fresh air'll be good for you.
Come on.

11:29.558 --> 11:31.038
Fucking kidding me.

11:32.430 --> 11:34.911
Welcome.

11:34.955 --> 11:36.391
How are you today?

11:36.434 --> 11:38.741
All right. I, uh, was wondering

11:38.785 --> 11:40.743
if you could help us find
Marc Lee.

11:40.787 --> 11:43.920
You're looking at him.
You must be Rick and Joe.

11:43.964 --> 11:46.531
Oh. [whistles] Hey.
What the hell's going on?

11:46.575 --> 11:48.533
This guy's expecting us?

11:48.577 --> 11:50.274
Yeah, well, I read about Marc

11:50.318 --> 11:51.798
when I started
working on my PTS.

11:51.841 --> 11:53.713
He's a former Ranger,
had a TBI,

11:53.756 --> 11:55.540
made worse
with post-traumatic stress.

11:55.584 --> 11:57.412
He found a way through.
I figured

11:57.455 --> 11:58.718
-his story could help you.
-All right, okay.

11:58.761 --> 11:59.936
Point this guy back
to Woodstock

11:59.980 --> 12:01.764
and let's get the fuck
out of here.

12:01.808 --> 12:03.679
Hey. I'm trying to find you
some hope, man.

12:03.723 --> 12:06.029
Hope? Okay.
You have a nice day.

12:06.073 --> 12:07.901
I'd like to wish you the same,
but your friend told me

12:07.944 --> 12:09.467
a little about you,
and I can't imagine

12:09.511 --> 12:11.121
you envision
many nice days ahead.

12:11.165 --> 12:12.949
What, you're just gonna
advertise

12:12.993 --> 12:14.821
what's going on with me on
Stars and Stripes?Is that it?

12:14.864 --> 12:18.955
Yeah. Yeah, I remember
that paranoid feeling.

12:18.999 --> 12:20.870
Living with my parents.

12:20.914 --> 12:24.656
Fired from my second job, eight
months after getting discharged.

12:24.700 --> 12:27.007
I couldn't stand to think
about them taking care

12:27.050 --> 12:28.748
of their grown-ass son,

12:28.791 --> 12:31.533
so I took matters
into my own hands.

12:32.839 --> 12:34.579
Yeah, well,
suck-starting a pistol's

12:34.623 --> 12:35.885
got a better
batting average, buddy.

12:35.929 --> 12:37.887
Well, I didn't want my family
to see

12:37.931 --> 12:39.976
what we've all seen
on the battlefield.

12:40.020 --> 12:42.544
I thought this would be easier
for 'em.

12:44.764 --> 12:48.550
My dad found me
before it was too late.

12:50.726 --> 12:53.424
I'm happy to tell you
about my journey.

12:58.386 --> 12:59.909
[Jason sighs]

12:59.953 --> 13:03.391
You know, there are records
of warriors complaining

13:03.434 --> 13:05.393
about slurred speech,

13:05.436 --> 13:08.657
inability to concentrate,
depression

13:08.700 --> 13:11.529
as far back as 3,000 years ago
in Mesopotamia.

13:11.573 --> 13:13.009
All right, look, I'm not really

13:13.053 --> 13:15.403
into this whole
3,000-year-old history lesson,

13:15.446 --> 13:16.883
so, let's go.

13:16.926 --> 13:18.754
Short version--
war fucked up my brain.

13:18.798 --> 13:21.539
I tried a few things
to unfuck it up.

13:21.583 --> 13:23.890
I had the most success
with this.

13:25.152 --> 13:26.370
Soup?

13:26.414 --> 13:28.459
It's huachuma cactus,

13:28.503 --> 13:29.896
more commonly known
by the name

13:29.939 --> 13:32.115
the first Europeans
who tried it gave it--

13:32.159 --> 13:34.204
San Pedro, after St. Peter.

13:34.248 --> 13:37.338
-St. Peter holds the keys
to heaven.
-That's right.

13:37.381 --> 13:42.560
Those who drink San Pedro reach
some sort of... enlightenment.

13:42.604 --> 13:45.607
Dissolving your ego
to confront fear has a way

13:45.650 --> 13:47.827
-of balancing you.
-Hmm. So you're saying

13:47.870 --> 13:51.656
the solution to your problems
is drinking some cactus plant

13:51.700 --> 13:53.484
that makes you shit yourself?

13:53.528 --> 13:55.704
Yeah, you're thinking
about ayahuasca,

13:55.747 --> 13:57.227
but the principle is the same.

13:57.271 --> 14:02.493
Psychedelic drugs work
by rewiring neural pathways.

14:02.537 --> 14:04.844
Friend of ours mentioned
research

14:04.887 --> 14:07.411
into psychedelics
as treatment for TBI.

14:07.455 --> 14:08.891
Right. Evidence shows

14:08.935 --> 14:11.546
that psychedelics decrease
neuroinflammation

14:11.589 --> 14:13.417
and increase neuroplasticity.

14:13.461 --> 14:15.942
Could you explain that
in English, bud?

14:15.985 --> 14:17.900
The rewiring--

14:17.944 --> 14:22.122
it allows the brain
to bypass scarred tissue and...

14:22.165 --> 14:25.255
rebuild itself.

14:26.474 --> 14:29.390
It's wild, man, and it works.

14:29.433 --> 14:33.481
Former athletes have started
companies to work this problem.

14:33.524 --> 14:35.570
Hell, DARPA's
spending $27 million

14:35.613 --> 14:38.355
to develop synthetics
with all the benefits

14:38.399 --> 14:39.791
and none
of the hallucinations

14:39.835 --> 14:41.706
to treat vets
with neuropsych issues.

14:41.750 --> 14:44.796
RAY:
The science is coming. I mean,

14:44.840 --> 14:48.148
be a damn shame if you gave up
before it got here.

14:48.191 --> 14:51.151
If this stuff didn't work,

14:51.194 --> 14:54.284
no way I'd be here.

14:54.328 --> 14:56.504
I'm in.

14:56.547 --> 14:59.811
-Give me the San Pedro.
Mix it up.
-Whoa, no. Hold on, wait.

14:59.855 --> 15:02.423
Go talk to the plant lady,
get it going, bud.

15:02.466 --> 15:03.728
I brought you here for answers,

15:03.772 --> 15:05.513
all right, some hope,
not to get high.

15:05.556 --> 15:07.210
Scientists are still
figuring this stuff out.

15:07.254 --> 15:09.517
One dose is not
gonna magically fix you.

15:09.560 --> 15:11.127
We'll wait
till we get back home,

15:11.171 --> 15:12.824
we'll find some treatments
that you're interested in,

15:12.868 --> 15:16.089
-find a doctor away
from Command.
-No.

15:16.132 --> 15:17.655
I go back home,
I'm not gonna have this option,

15:17.699 --> 15:19.919
you understand?
We're in an Omega op.

15:19.962 --> 15:22.008
Omega is not a blank check.
If Command was

15:22.051 --> 15:24.488
-to ever find out about this...
-You gonna tell Command?

15:25.881 --> 15:29.145
If Swanny wanted
to do something like this,

15:29.189 --> 15:31.800
would you say "no"?

15:42.463 --> 15:44.465
[upbeat music plays in distance]

15:44.508 --> 15:46.728
[indistinct chatter, laughter]

15:52.299 --> 15:54.301
[Spanish music playing]

15:54.344 --> 15:56.564
[chatter in Spanish]

16:08.793 --> 16:12.884
Say hello to my little Blondie!
[laughs]

16:12.928 --> 16:15.496
[sniffing]
Ooh.

16:15.539 --> 16:17.889
You have any idea
how many lines you've crossed?

16:17.933 --> 16:19.587
Well, the only lines

16:19.630 --> 16:21.719
I'm concerned about
are these tasty white ones.

16:21.763 --> 16:23.286
[sniffs]

16:25.245 --> 16:27.203
Hey, where did you get
all this shit?

16:27.247 --> 16:30.424
Took it off the Hilajos.

16:30.467 --> 16:32.600
-Who are "the Hilajos"?
-Hilajos.

16:32.643 --> 16:35.385
Local gangbangers--
Hijos del Diablo.

16:35.429 --> 16:37.431
Sons of the Devil.

16:37.474 --> 16:38.823
Yeah, that's appropriate,
actually,

16:38.867 --> 16:40.564
'cause they actually got
the red ass

16:40.608 --> 16:43.045
when I stole their cocaine
and their senorita.

16:43.089 --> 16:45.439
-You come here, little lady.
-[both laugh]

16:45.482 --> 16:47.354
SONNY:
Mm. Yeah.

16:47.397 --> 16:49.486
They was getting wild
at the club where I dance,

16:49.530 --> 16:53.055
and El Jefe here knocked them
out and took their stuff.

16:53.099 --> 16:56.145
I did, yeah, and I figured,
well, I got your party favors,

16:56.189 --> 16:59.148
so let's go have a party!
[whooping]

16:59.192 --> 17:01.672
Yeah, well, party's over. Sorry.

17:01.716 --> 17:03.196
-Oh, come on, man.
-Party's over.

17:03.239 --> 17:06.068
Hey, everyone get out.
Get out now. Get the fuck out!

17:06.112 --> 17:08.331
[speaking Spanish]
Come on.

17:08.375 --> 17:11.943
[speaking Spanish]
Let's go. Let's go.

17:11.987 --> 17:13.510
Everybody out. We got to go.
Party's over.

17:13.554 --> 17:16.165
-My hermanois el funo policia.
-Mmm.

17:16.209 --> 17:19.690
-Oh, that's right.
-Adios, papi.

17:19.734 --> 17:22.041
-Te amo mucho.
-Let's go.

17:29.265 --> 17:30.571
[door closes]

17:30.614 --> 17:33.052
You have just compromised
this entire operation.

17:33.095 --> 17:35.097
No, I haven't.

17:35.141 --> 17:37.447
-You haven't?
-Oh, that is strong.

17:37.491 --> 17:39.449
-Really?
-No, I haven't because...

17:39.493 --> 17:42.583
I actually paid for this
in Colombian cash,

17:42.626 --> 17:45.281
and it's not traceable,
and if you noticed,

17:45.325 --> 17:48.458
there's no security cameras
in this hotel.

17:48.502 --> 17:50.373
That is a shit ton
of coke and cash.

17:50.417 --> 17:53.115
-[laughs]
-Yeah, these dudes are gonna
want it back.

17:53.159 --> 17:56.945
Yeah, well, no, no. The shit
grows on trees down here.

17:56.988 --> 17:58.512
They're not gonna miss it, okay?

17:58.555 --> 18:00.079
And the gangbangers--

18:00.122 --> 18:03.169
they are all hat
and no cattle, okay?

18:03.212 --> 18:04.866
They're just a bunch
of local punks.

18:04.909 --> 18:06.172
They're definitely not cartel.
But I tell you what.

18:06.215 --> 18:08.522
I have a great idea, okay?
[sniffles]

18:08.565 --> 18:13.875
What do you say, you and I--
we fire back up this fiesta?

18:13.918 --> 18:15.833
You're too strung out to go back
to the team.

18:15.877 --> 18:17.966
-You need to sleep it off.
-No, no.

18:18.009 --> 18:19.881
Lay your ass down
and sleep it off.

18:19.924 --> 18:23.667
Take a nap, buddy.
Take a nap.

18:25.582 --> 18:27.715
[sighs]

18:30.892 --> 18:33.373
-Think it's kicked in yet?
-Yeah.

18:34.939 --> 18:38.204
Another way
this isn't like ayahuasca--

18:38.247 --> 18:41.294
he can manage
the journey alone.

18:41.337 --> 18:44.949
In case you'd rather try it
than keep watch.

18:44.993 --> 18:47.648
Oh. No, I think he needs me more

18:47.691 --> 18:50.172
than I need my mind bent
right now.

18:50.216 --> 18:51.652
You're a helper.

18:53.871 --> 18:56.396
Well, I haven't felt
like much of one lately,

18:56.439 --> 18:59.703
but it's how I was raised.

18:59.747 --> 19:03.011
My dad left pretty big shoes
to fill.

19:07.276 --> 19:09.496
Tell me about him.

19:11.280 --> 19:15.415
Um, he was a firefighter.

19:15.458 --> 19:18.374
Died on 9/11.

19:18.418 --> 19:20.724
My fault
he was working that shift.

19:23.814 --> 19:26.687
Sounds to me like,
because of you,

19:26.730 --> 19:29.646
he was in a position to help
a lot of people that morning.

19:33.259 --> 19:35.565
Never thought of it like that.

19:35.609 --> 19:37.567
I mean, beating yourself up
is natural,

19:37.611 --> 19:39.265
but maybe consider
all the people

19:39.308 --> 19:40.614
who lived to see another day

19:40.657 --> 19:43.834
because your dad got them
to safety.

19:51.277 --> 19:54.932
Yeah.

19:54.976 --> 19:57.108
[soft dripping]

19:57.152 --> 19:59.328
[loud dripping]

20:06.814 --> 20:10.861
MALE VOICE:
Hayes! The hell is taking
so long with those beers?

20:17.607 --> 20:19.435
[bottles clink]

20:22.221 --> 20:24.614
[man laughing]

20:26.355 --> 20:29.271
Cujo? What the fuck, man?

20:29.315 --> 20:31.665
You guys couldn't find
a more flattering picture?

20:31.708 --> 20:34.320
-I've, uh...
-Look at this.

20:34.363 --> 20:36.844
-Uh...
-[bottles clink]

20:36.887 --> 20:40.108
Yeah, well, I could've--
could find a new one, but I...

20:40.151 --> 20:43.633
I don't know if it
would make up for...

20:43.677 --> 20:45.287
Make up for what?

20:45.331 --> 20:47.724
Well, getting you killed
on the Al-Hazred op.

20:47.768 --> 20:49.639
Oh, Jesus.

20:49.683 --> 20:51.902
You've became a downer
in your old age.

20:51.946 --> 20:53.600
You're still hung up on that?

20:53.643 --> 20:55.732
You're not?

20:55.776 --> 20:57.343
[scoffs] I mean...

20:58.822 --> 21:02.391
Wouldn't be disappointed if you
named your son after me, but...

21:02.435 --> 21:04.132
How'd the rest of the op go?

21:05.916 --> 21:07.266
Huh?

21:07.309 --> 21:09.746
The team, they finish the job?
Erase Al-Hazred?

21:09.790 --> 21:10.791
Oh, yeah, I got him.

21:10.834 --> 21:12.140
You bagged the big trophy?

21:12.183 --> 21:13.750
Hell yes, brother.

21:13.794 --> 21:15.099
Yeah.

21:15.143 --> 21:19.060
I bet that
changed things for you.

21:19.103 --> 21:20.235
Hmm?

21:20.279 --> 21:23.760
There you go.

21:23.804 --> 21:27.808
Things go wrong,
but they also go right.

21:31.246 --> 21:33.814
To the things that go right.

21:33.857 --> 21:35.424
[bottles clink]

21:46.348 --> 21:49.525
[distant siren wailing]

21:49.569 --> 21:51.527
Let's go.

21:51.571 --> 21:54.704
[sighs] It's not enough
for you to ruin my deployment,

21:54.748 --> 21:56.793
you got to go ahead
and ruin my leave, too.

21:56.837 --> 21:58.752
Would you rather have Jason
come chase you down

21:58.795 --> 22:00.449
-after this bender?
-Jace would totally
understand, okay?

22:00.493 --> 22:03.104
That right there,
that is old-school team shit.

22:03.147 --> 22:04.801
Wow. You know, I never realized

22:04.845 --> 22:07.195
the old-school teams
were full of selfish assholes.

22:09.197 --> 22:12.722
It's time to put
your big boy pants on. Let's go.

22:18.206 --> 22:19.555
Really?

22:21.252 --> 22:22.515
You're gonna square up on me

22:22.558 --> 22:23.907
for pulling you out
of a career-ender?

22:23.951 --> 22:25.169
-Yeah, I am.
-Okay.

22:25.213 --> 22:27.171
Yeah, 'cause that ego of yours

22:27.215 --> 22:29.217
is gonna get
an ass-whupping one day.

22:29.260 --> 22:30.610
Let's hurry up and go.

22:30.653 --> 22:32.220
Come on.

22:34.962 --> 22:36.529
[door closes]

If you only think about the end,
you forget about the start.

36:50.425 --> 36:53.080
What's that?

36:53.123 --> 36:55.474
You know what that is.

36:55.517 --> 36:57.650
It's from the quarry.

37:20.455 --> 37:22.544
You uprooted your whole life,

37:22.588 --> 37:24.285
moved to a different hemisphere,

37:24.329 --> 37:27.157
to open a retreat. I...

37:27.201 --> 37:28.463
I admire your commitment.

37:28.507 --> 37:30.117
I'm flattered you think

37:30.160 --> 37:32.685
I had a life back home
to uproot. [chuckles]

37:36.471 --> 37:39.648
Curious how you managed
such a big pivot.

37:39.692 --> 37:42.999
I mean, considering warriors
and change do not mix.

37:43.043 --> 37:44.958
I had no choice.

37:46.655 --> 37:49.484
You ever think about that term,
"armed services"?

37:49.528 --> 37:53.314
Like, if I wanted
to be of service,

37:53.358 --> 37:56.230
why do I need to be armed?

37:56.274 --> 37:59.059
Used to wonder that
all the time.

38:03.193 --> 38:06.153
So, all this is your path
to forgiving yourself?

38:06.196 --> 38:09.896
San Pedro helped me
make sense of what I'd done.

38:11.941 --> 38:14.857
Thing is, I don't know
how much blood is on my hands,

38:14.901 --> 38:17.643
so the scales
may never be balanced.

38:20.733 --> 38:22.517
But each person I help

38:22.561 --> 38:25.477
gets me a little closer.

38:25.520 --> 38:30.482
RAY: Yeah, sometimes
helping one's hard enough.

38:32.962 --> 38:35.225
My wife and I, we-we...

38:35.269 --> 38:37.010
tried helping this vet,

38:37.053 --> 38:39.360
Sam,

38:39.404 --> 38:43.538
get him off the streets
and into the system, but he, uh,

38:43.582 --> 38:45.061
he disappeared on us.

38:45.105 --> 38:46.889
Well, you tried.

38:46.933 --> 38:48.978
That's more than
most people would do.

38:50.763 --> 38:53.983
Still, that failure stung.

38:56.290 --> 38:58.074
Thought I could
make up for it with plans

38:58.118 --> 39:00.076
to help even more guys like Sam.

39:00.120 --> 39:01.600
Something on the scale
of what you're doing.

39:01.643 --> 39:04.907
Oh, this place
is my full-time job.

39:04.951 --> 39:07.301
You already have one.

39:08.737 --> 39:11.653
Still feel like I'm abandoning
people who need me.

39:11.697 --> 39:13.699
He needs you,

39:13.742 --> 39:15.570
and you're here.

39:17.572 --> 39:20.706
Sounds to me like
you've found your path.

39:20.749 --> 39:24.449
You'll know when the time
is right to start walking it.

39:27.103 --> 39:28.627
Copy that.

39:35.503 --> 39:38.767
This is from the quarry
where we met.

39:38.811 --> 39:40.116
Yup.

39:40.160 --> 39:42.597
The start.

39:42.641 --> 39:46.122
The thing that went right.

39:46.166 --> 39:48.951
Yeah, I saw this in the water.

39:48.995 --> 39:51.780
Something happened, and you...

39:51.824 --> 39:54.479
you saved me from drowning.

39:56.089 --> 39:57.612
[sighs]

39:57.656 --> 40:00.180
You saved my life, and I...

40:02.835 --> 40:04.140
...took yours away.

40:04.184 --> 40:07.143
Oh, Jesus Christ,
will you stop saying that?

40:07.187 --> 40:08.536
Well, I did. I did.

40:08.580 --> 40:10.320
Were you driving
the truck that hit me?

40:10.364 --> 40:13.933
No, but you were in the car

40:13.976 --> 40:15.935
running an errand for me, so...

40:15.978 --> 40:17.371
I was buying

40:17.415 --> 40:20.113
wine, beer, and chicken

40:20.156 --> 40:22.202
for us.

40:22.245 --> 40:24.117
You're not responsible.

40:24.160 --> 40:26.641
But before that,

40:26.685 --> 40:30.123
you, uh, you had a life,
you sacrificed so much for me.

40:30.166 --> 40:32.168
You sacrificed everything,
and you gave it...

40:32.212 --> 40:33.518
you gave your whole life up.

40:33.561 --> 40:35.476
No, you don't get to tell me
what my life--

40:35.520 --> 40:39.393
what our life was
'cause we were both there,

40:39.437 --> 40:42.527
and despite what
you want to believe,

40:42.570 --> 40:46.052
our good days
outweighed our shitty ones.

40:48.968 --> 40:53.059
People who love me,
they end up just getting hurt,

40:53.102 --> 40:54.713
and with my situation now,

40:54.756 --> 40:58.238
with my head,
it's just gonna get worse.

41:00.501 --> 41:04.505
So that's why you want
to go out on your shield,

41:04.549 --> 41:06.507
to protect people who love you?

41:06.551 --> 41:08.248
And you're not deserving
of their love

41:08.291 --> 41:09.510
when you need it most?

41:09.554 --> 41:13.514
The choices I made
are why I'm here.

41:13.558 --> 41:17.039
I spent most of my life
loving you.

41:17.083 --> 41:18.954
Yeah.

41:19.912 --> 41:23.089
Well, that was a mistake.

41:23.132 --> 41:26.962
I don't regret one minute of it.

41:27.006 --> 41:29.051
I fucked up.

41:29.095 --> 41:31.097
I fucked us up. I fucked us up.

41:31.140 --> 41:34.579
-How could you not?
-[sniffles]

41:34.622 --> 41:37.669
-All the blood, all the trauma.
-[sighs]

41:37.712 --> 41:41.281
But that doesn't condemn you
to a life of misery.

41:45.154 --> 41:47.592
If I was alive
and asked you to try again...

41:49.463 --> 41:51.509
...you'd say no?

41:53.946 --> 41:55.425
You deserve better.

41:55.469 --> 41:59.255
You deserve
a lot better than me.

41:59.299 --> 42:02.084
Well, I guess we're back
where we started.

42:02.128 --> 42:04.304
What's that mean?

42:06.088 --> 42:09.048
I have to save you again.

42:16.229 --> 42:20.102
I will allow you regrets,

42:20.146 --> 42:23.976
but I won't allow you
to give up on yourself.

42:25.586 --> 42:26.935
I never did.

42:26.979 --> 42:28.589
[sniffles]

42:29.982 --> 42:32.941
Jason Hayes,

42:32.985 --> 42:36.031
you are worthy of love.

42:51.656 --> 42:53.222
Give me your cell phone.

42:59.925 --> 43:03.711
We got to scrub the vehicle.
Davis is sending a pickup.

43:03.755 --> 43:05.583
Whatever.

43:11.023 --> 43:13.547
Look, man, I...

43:13.591 --> 43:16.768
I've made peace
with the cost of this job,

43:16.811 --> 43:19.945
but I did not sign up to get
killed over your pity party.

43:19.988 --> 43:22.991
Never asked you
to come and save me.

43:23.035 --> 43:26.212
Nearly orphaning your son,
that's on you.

43:28.693 --> 43:31.391
What about Leanne?

43:32.348 --> 43:34.655
She's out of Vah Beach,
but she's not out of your life.

43:34.699 --> 43:36.657
But you're just gonna
just throw in the towel on her?

43:36.701 --> 43:38.354
Oh, we can't all be
as lucky as you, Clay,

43:38.398 --> 43:39.965
with the white
picket fence, okay?

43:40.008 --> 43:41.357
Oh, wow. Lucky?
Yeah, you know what?

43:41.401 --> 43:43.664
I'm-I'm fucking--
I'm really lucky, man.

43:43.708 --> 43:46.275
I've never held my son.

43:46.319 --> 43:48.408
He was, he was ripped away
from us at birth,

43:48.451 --> 43:49.844
stuck with a bunch of tubes,

43:49.888 --> 43:52.630
and he's been fighting
for his life all alone.

43:54.022 --> 43:56.546
I can only pray that he gets
the same shot at life

43:56.590 --> 43:58.244
that Leanne got.

44:00.028 --> 44:02.335
And for being so brave,

44:02.378 --> 44:04.380
his reward was nearly
losing his dad

44:04.424 --> 44:07.122
because of your fucking
pathetic ass.

44:14.347 --> 44:16.566
I'm sorry, Cl-Clay. I didn't--

44:16.610 --> 44:18.568
That's, like, a tough go
for your son, and I...

44:18.612 --> 44:21.136
You know what, just--
Sonny, shut up.

44:23.225 --> 44:26.272
I'm done, I'm done
with your-your bullshit, man.

44:26.315 --> 44:28.100
I'm done.

44:43.158 --> 44:45.204
I know this is more
than you came here for,

44:45.247 --> 44:49.077
but I hope it helps put you
on the path to healing.

44:49.121 --> 44:51.340
It definitely helped me.

44:51.384 --> 44:53.560
Jury's still out on him, though.

44:53.603 --> 44:55.083
Well...

44:55.127 --> 44:57.346
just keep him hydrated.

44:57.390 --> 44:59.435
-Stay in touch.
-Yes, sir.

44:59.479 --> 45:01.437
All right.

45:01.481 --> 45:03.004
Whoa.

45:03.048 --> 45:05.224
Let me get that
for you, brother.

45:10.664 --> 45:13.014
-[groans] Hey.
-Yeah?

45:13.058 --> 45:15.321
Thank you.

45:28.508 --> 45:31.598
-You did all this in one night?
-All the key drop-offs occur

45:31.641 --> 45:33.687
at different locations
within these

45:33.731 --> 45:35.297
five city blocks.

45:35.341 --> 45:37.169
Yeah, but the buildings
are abandoned.

45:37.212 --> 45:38.910
Except for the textile plant.

45:38.953 --> 45:41.260
Which makes it the perfect
shield to deter an airstrike

45:41.303 --> 45:42.522
for any surrounding building

45:42.565 --> 45:45.090
housing a nuclear
enrichment facility.

45:49.007 --> 45:51.923
It's underground.

45:53.315 --> 45:56.492
The textile plant
is directly above the center.

45:56.536 --> 46:00.366
These drop-off sites are
different entrances underground.
