11:40.250 --> 11:43.750
YOU CAN'T BE KILLER AND DAD.
HAVEN'T YOU LEARNED ANYTHING?

11:43.750 --> 11:45.750
HER MOTHER IS DEAD
BECAUSE OF YOU.

11:45.750 --> 11:47.417
- WHICH IS WHY
I NEED TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT

11:47.417 --> 11:48.959
AND BE A GOOD FATHER.

11:48.959 --> 11:50.375
- A GOOD FATHER
WOULD GET THOSE GIRLS

11:50.375 --> 11:53.333
AS FAR AWAY AS POSSIBLE.

11:59.208 --> 12:01.166
- HARRISON'S STILL
AT THE APARTMENT WITH SONYA.

12:01.166 --> 12:03.709
I'M GONNA GO GET HIM,
BRING HIM BACK HERE.

12:05.375 --> 12:07.834
[cabinet doors clacking]

12:12.917 --> 12:15.375

12:15.375 --> 12:17.208
YOU'RE GONNA BREAK SOMETHING.
RELAX.

12:17.208 --> 12:18.542
- YOU RELAX.
YOU'RE NOT ABOUT TO HAVE

12:18.542 --> 12:20.333
THE WORST MEETING
OF YOUR CAREER.

12:20.333 --> 12:22.333
- IT'S A UNION REP.
HE'S ON YOUR SIDE.

12:22.333 --> 12:24.834
YOU KNOW, JUST BE PROFESSIONAL
AND DON'T FREAK OUT

12:24.834 --> 12:26.375
UNTIL YOU ACTUALLY KNOW
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

12:26.375 --> 12:28.709
- I KNOW WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.
I'M GONNA GET FIRED--

12:28.709 --> 12:29.834
- NO, YOU'RE NOT.

12:29.834 --> 12:31.542
EVEN LAGUERTA SAID
THIS ISN'T GONNA STICK.

12:31.542 --> 12:33.750
- I'M SUPPOSED TO TRUST HER?
- NO.

12:33.750 --> 12:36.375
BUT YOU CAN TRUST ME.

12:36.375 --> 12:38.166
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE OKAY.

12:38.166 --> 12:39.959
YOU KNOW WHY?

12:39.959 --> 12:41.792
'CAUSE YOU'RE GONNA GET
YOUR JOB BACK.

12:41.792 --> 12:43.583
YOU GOEVERYONE
AT THE STATION ON YOUR SIDE.

12:43.583 --> 12:45.917
YOU GOT A BOYFRIEND
WHO LOVES YOU.

12:45.917 --> 12:47.208
- [laughs]

12:49.750 --> 12:52.792
SERIOUSLY? YOU'RE GONNA
DROP THAT ON ME NOW?

12:52.792 --> 12:54.875
- IT'S JUST AN EXPRESSION.
IT SLIPPED OUT.

12:54.875 --> 12:57.792
- I GOTTA GO.
- FINE. FORGET I SAID IT.

13:00.917 --> 13:02.959

SUNSHINE.

13:06.750 --> 13:08.917
YOU ALONE?
- YEAH. WHAT'S UP?

13:08.917 --> 13:10.750
- YOUR PECKER.
SOON AS YOU TAKE A LOOK

13:10.750 --> 13:13.959
AT THESE SNAPS I TOOK
OF YOUR BOY DEXTER MORGAN

13:13.959 --> 13:17.625
AND HIS GAL PAL ON SOME KIND OF
MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT BOAT RUN.

13:17.625 --> 13:19.667
WANNA MEET FOR A BEER?
- IT'S 7:00 A.M.

13:19.667 --> 13:20.959
- BEER IS GOOD ANYTIME.

13:20.959 --> 13:23.959
- YEAH. I GOTTA WORK.
- THEN I'LL COME TO YOU.

13:23.959 --> 13:26.000
- WHAT'D I JUST SAY?
I CAN'T NOW!

13:26.000 --> 13:27.750
I'LL CALL YOU LATER.

13:37.333 --> 13:38.625
- [pops tongue]

13:46.458 --> 13:49.375
- YOU SURE YOU WANNA KEEP
YOUR APPOINTMENT WITH JORDAN?

13:49.375 --> 13:51.125
- WELL, I NEED TO.

13:51.125 --> 13:53.959
THERE'S NOT GONNA BE ANOTHER
CHANCE TO GET THE BLOOD.

13:53.959 --> 13:57.542
BESIDES, IT'S SOMETHING
I ACTUALLY KNOW HOW TO DO.

13:57.542 --> 14:00.834
YOU WERE A TEENAGED GIRL,
RIGHT?

14:00.834 --> 14:03.041
HOW DO I DEAL WITH ASTOR?

14:03.041 --> 14:04.667
- TRY TALKING TO HER.

14:04.667 --> 14:06.041
- LAST TIME I DID THAT,

14:06.041 --> 14:07.917
SHE SAID SHE HATED ME
AND MOVED TO ORLANDO.

14:07.917 --> 14:09.834
- WELL, NOW YOU GET
A SECOND CHANCE.

14:14.667 --> 14:16.834
SHARE SOMETHING WITH HER...

14:16.834 --> 14:18.083
WHAT YOU DID
WHEN YOU WERE HER AGE.

14:18.083 --> 14:19.667
- I KILLED
THE NEIGHBOR'S DOG.

14:19.667 --> 14:22.834
- WELL, DON'T TELL HER THAT.

14:22.834 --> 14:24.667
[door opens]

14:24.667 --> 14:26.417
- SERIOUSLY, WHAT DO I DO?

14:26.417 --> 14:28.875
- JUST...CUT HER SOME SLACK.

14:28.875 --> 14:31.041
ALL KIDS THAT AGE
MAKE MISTAKES.

14:31.041 --> 14:33.834
TRUST ME, THE HANGOVER
WILL BE PUNISHMENT ENOUGH.

14:33.834 --> 14:37.917
- OH, IS THAT YOUR BROTHER?

14:37.917 --> 14:40.875
- HARRISON.

14:40.875 --> 14:43.917
HE DOESN'T EVEN
RECOGNIZE ME.

14:43.917 --> 14:46.583
- WELL...YOU DIDN'T LOOK
LIKE A RACCOON

14:46.583 --> 14:49.083
THE LAST TIME HE SAW YOU.

14:52.667 --> 14:54.709
- EAT.
IT'S HANGOVER FOOD.

14:54.709 --> 14:57.083
IT'LL SOAK UP THE ALCOHOL.

14:57.083 --> 14:59.500
- TALK TO HER.

14:59.500 --> 15:02.333
SHARE SOMETHING.

15:02.333 --> 15:06.709
SO I NEED TO GO
TO A MEETING IN A FEW MINUTES.

15:06.709 --> 15:09.291
BUT I WAS HOPING AFTER THAT

15:09.291 --> 15:11.041
WE COULD SPEND
THE DAY TOGETHER,

15:11.041 --> 15:15.083
'CAUSE WE REALLY SHOULD TALK.

15:17.583 --> 15:19.583
SO IS THAT OKAY?

15:19.583 --> 15:21.834
- CAN HARRISON COME?

15:21.834 --> 15:23.250
- SURE.
I'LL CALL THE BABYSITTER,

15:23.250 --> 15:25.083
TELL HER
THERE'S A CHANGE OF PLANS.

15:33.667 --> 15:35.542
- MAMA.

15:38.417 --> 15:40.083
MAMA.

15:41.625 --> 15:43.917
- I HAVE NO IDEA
WHY HE SAID THAT.

15:43.917 --> 15:46.500
I BARELY KNOW HIM.
- STOP LYING, OKAY?

15:46.500 --> 15:49.125
I'M NOT STUPID.

15:49.125 --> 15:51.792
SHE'S NOT YOUR MAMA.

15:51.792 --> 15:54.917
YOUR MAMA'S DEAD.
- ASTOR.

15:54.917 --> 15:56.792
- I'LL TELL YOU THIS.

15:56.792 --> 15:58.625
IF YOU WERE THE ONE WHO DIED,

15:58.625 --> 16:00.125
I REALLY DOUBT
MY MOM WOULD HAVE

16:00.125 --> 16:02.750
BROUGHT IN A TENANT
SO FAST.

16:06.917 --> 16:09.291
- I SHOULD GO.
- I KNOW.

16:09.291 --> 16:11.125
- WE'LL ONLY BE
A COUPLE HOURS.

16:11.125 --> 16:12.792
- I CAN HANDLE IT.

16:16.625 --> 16:19.959
- MY FAMILY
IS PRETTY WEIRD TOO.

16:25.792 --> 16:26.917
- HEY.

16:36.959 --> 16:39.000
- HOW'D IT GO
WITH THE UNION SUIT?

16:39.000 --> 16:41.458
- THEY'RE STICKING ME
IN THE FILE ROOM.

16:41.458 --> 16:43.041
TILL AFTER MY HEARING.

16:43.041 --> 16:45.125
- YOU'RE NOT FIRED.
IT'S GOOD NEWS.

16:45.125 --> 16:46.333
- YEAH, IT'S GREAT.

16:46.333 --> 16:47.875
EXCEPT EVERYBODY
STILL THINKS

16:47.875 --> 16:50.000
I'M RESPONSIBLE
FOR THAT GIRL DYING

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
AND ALL THOSE KIDS GETTING
WOUNDED IN THAT NIGHTCLUB.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.792
- FOR THE RECORD,

16:54.792 --> 16:57.166
MY REPORT
BACKED YOUR STORY 100%.

16:57.166 --> 16:58.959
NOT THAT IT MATTERED.

16:58.959 --> 17:00.792
THE BRASS BACKED MY WIFE.

17:00.792 --> 17:03.000
- MATTERS TO ME.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.667
THANK YOU.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.750
ANYBODY NEEDS
A REAL FUCKING DETECTIVE,

17:08.750 --> 17:11.125
I'LL BE IN THE FILE ROOM.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.333
DETECTIVE SCAPEGOAT
REPORTING FOR DUTY.

17:16.333 --> 17:19.375
- [chuckling]
THEY SAID YOU'D BE JOINING ME.

17:19.375 --> 17:22.834
COME ON.
I CAN GET YOU STARTED.

17:22.834 --> 17:25.041
RIGHT OVER THERE.

17:25.041 --> 17:28.208
SO...HOW'S IT GOING
WITH THAT MAN OF YOURS?

17:28.208 --> 17:30.875
- THIS MORNING
OUT OF THE BLUE, HE...

17:30.875 --> 17:32.375
TOLD ME HE LOVED ME.

17:32.375 --> 17:33.458
- OH!

17:33.458 --> 17:34.542
YOU SAY IT BACK?

17:34.542 --> 17:36.291
- NO. I RAN.

17:36.291 --> 17:37.959
- WHAT? WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

17:37.959 --> 17:39.542
YOU DON'T FEEL THE SAME WAY?

17:39.542 --> 17:41.208
- NO, THE PROBLEM IS
IS THAT...

17:41.208 --> 17:43.625
I'M AFRAID I MIGHT.
[laughs]

17:43.625 --> 17:45.041
- OH!
[chuckling]

17:45.041 --> 17:46.750
- WHAT IS THIS,
THE BARREL GIRLS CASE?

17:46.750 --> 17:49.750
FILE IT UNDER CREEPY?
- UNDER CLOSED CASES.

17:49.750 --> 17:51.667
NOT READ, HONEY. FILE.

17:51.667 --> 17:53.166
THAT'S WHAT I GET PAID TO DO,

17:53.166 --> 17:55.709
AND FOR THE NEXT FEW WEEKS,

17:55.709 --> 17:57.542
[whispers] SO DO YOU.

17:57.542 --> 18:00.000
[chuckling]

18:09.917 --> 18:11.083
- GOOD SESSION.

18:11.083 --> 18:13.625
- ANOTHER HOUR
OF RUNNING IN PLACE.

18:13.625 --> 18:16.166
- YOU SEEM MORE OPEN.
YOU FEEL THE DIFFERENCE?

18:16.166 --> 18:17.375
- YEAH.

18:17.375 --> 18:19.041
I FEEL LIKE I MIGHT...

18:19.041 --> 18:21.417
TAKE AWAY SOMETHING VALUABLE
THIS TIME.

18:21.417 --> 18:23.750
- MM. GOOD.

18:23.750 --> 18:25.834
WELL, I GOTTA TELL YA.

18:25.834 --> 18:27.542
I STILL FEEL LIKE

18:27.542 --> 18:30.083
YOU'RE NOT BEING
COMPLETELY HONEST WITH ME.

18:32.083 --> 18:34.542
- REALLY?
[water turns on]

18:34.542 --> 18:37.333
'BOUT WHAT?
- ABOUT WHAT YOU REALLY WANT.

18:37.333 --> 18:38.917
- WHAT I REALLY WANT...

18:38.917 --> 18:41.208
JUST A DROP.

18:41.208 --> 18:43.709
A 30-GAUGE NEEDLE SHOULD
SLIDE RIGHT IN UNDETECTED.

18:43.709 --> 18:46.083
[water continues running]

18:46.083 --> 18:48.625
HE WON'T EVEN NOTICE
IT'S MISSING.

18:48.625 --> 18:50.917
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

18:50.917 --> 18:53.750
- WHAT YOU WANT OUT OF LIFE.

18:53.750 --> 18:55.625
WHATEVER IT IS,
YOU HAVE TO TELL ME

18:55.625 --> 18:58.458
SO THAT I CAN HELP YOU
CONSTRUCT A PLAN TO GET THERE.

18:58.458 --> 19:00.000
- I HAVE A PLAN TO GET THERE.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.959
LUMEN AND I FOLLOW
THIS BLOOD TRAIL.

19:01.959 --> 19:03.291
WE TAKE YOU OUT.

19:03.291 --> 19:06.750
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
YOU'RE HELPING ME ALREADY.

19:06.750 --> 19:09.709
- I HOPE SO.
I REALLY DO.

19:09.709 --> 19:11.125
[water running]

19:12.875 --> 19:14.417
[faucet squeaks,
water stops]

19:16.959 --> 19:19.208
EACH OF US...

19:19.208 --> 19:21.458
DEEP DOWN,
WE KNOW WHAT WE REALLY WANT.

19:21.458 --> 19:24.542
IT'S JUST A MATTER
OF ACTUALLY DOING IT.

19:24.542 --> 19:25.500
- YEAH.

19:27.458 --> 19:29.875
OH.
I GOTTA GET BACK TO WORK.

19:29.875 --> 19:32.333
NEW EVIDENCE TO PROCESS.

19:32.333 --> 19:35.291
BUT, UH, THANKS AGAIN
FOR EVERYTHING.

19:35.291 --> 19:37.375
- SO WHEN'S OUR NEXT
APPOINTMENT?

19:37.375 --> 19:40.291
- I'LL CHECK WITH
THE RECEPTIONIST.

20:37.875 --> 20:39.875
- WHAT DID I TELL YOU?

20:39.875 --> 20:41.875
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
FILING THINGS AWAY,

20:41.875 --> 20:44.667
NOT MAKIN' A MESS.

20:44.667 --> 20:46.291
- WAIT, WAIT.
I WAS READING THAT.

20:46.291 --> 20:49.667
- YEAH, THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
- JUST GIVE ME ONE MORE SECOND.

20:53.250 --> 20:55.250
HOLY SHIT!
LOOK AT THIS.

20:55.250 --> 20:56.917
- WHAT AM I LOOKIN' AT?

20:56.917 --> 20:59.917
- DNA RESULTS.
MULTIPLE DNA RESULTS.

20:59.917 --> 21:02.000
THE BARREL GIRLS CASE?
- MM-HMM.

21:02.000 --> 21:05.250
- WE PINNED THIS ON ONE GUY
AND...

21:05.250 --> 21:07.917
LOOKS LIKE THERE ARE
MULTIPLE PERPS.

21:07.917 --> 21:10.625
I'M JUST GONNA...

21:10.625 --> 21:12.250
TELL ME WHAT YOU SEE.

21:12.250 --> 21:15.083
- DNA SEQUENCING REPORT,
UH...

21:15.083 --> 21:17.917
PARTIAL SEQUENCES ON THREE,
MAYBE FOUR PERPS?

21:17.917 --> 21:19.875
- WHAT CASE IS THIS?

21:19.875 --> 21:21.750
- BARREL GIRLS.

21:21.750 --> 21:23.792
- DIDN'T WE...DIDN'T WE
PIN THIS ON ONE GUY?

21:23.792 --> 21:25.417
- YES. BOYD FOWLER.

21:25.417 --> 21:28.041
BUT THE CORONER FOUND
TRACE DNA ON THE GIRLS

21:28.041 --> 21:29.792
THAT WASN'T BOYD'S.

21:29.792 --> 21:32.417
THERE WERE PARTIAL SEQUENCES
FROM MULTIPLE PEOPLE.

21:32.417 --> 21:34.208
IT'S ALL IN THE FILE.

21:34.208 --> 21:36.709
- WHY AM I ONLY HEARING
ABOUT THIS NOW?

21:36.709 --> 21:39.333
- BECAUSE BY THE TIME THE FINAL
CORONER REPORT CAME THROUGH,

21:39.333 --> 21:40.917
WE'D ALREADY CLOSED THE CASE.

21:40.917 --> 21:42.458
THE ONLY REASON
I CAME ACROSS THIS

21:42.458 --> 21:44.250
WAS BECAUSE I WAS
FILING IT ALL AWAY.

21:44.250 --> 21:46.375
LOOK.

21:46.375 --> 21:49.250
THIS IS COLE HARMON,
OUR ORIGINAL SUSPECT.

21:49.250 --> 21:51.417
JORDAN CHASE'S SECURITY GUY.
WE LET HIM GO.

21:51.417 --> 21:55.125
WE GOT DNA SAMPLES ON HIM.
TELL ME WHAT YOU SEE.

21:55.125 --> 21:57.291
- THERE ARE ENOUGH
COMMON MARKERS

21:57.291 --> 21:59.125
THAT COLE HARMON
IS LOOKING PRETTY GOOD

21:59.125 --> 22:01.208
FOR THE BARREL GIRLS' MURDERS.

22:01.208 --> 22:02.709
AT THE VERY LEAST,
HE CAN'T BE EXCLUDED.

22:02.709 --> 22:05.542
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING, THAT COLE
AND BOYD DID THIS TOGETHER?

22:05.542 --> 22:07.625
- YEAH.

22:07.625 --> 22:10.959
WITH MAYBE THREE
OR FOUR OTHERS.

22:10.959 --> 22:13.375
- WE GOTTA REOPEN THIS CASE.

22:13.375 --> 22:16.291
- I KNOW.
BUT I CAN'T TELL LAGUERTA.

22:16.291 --> 22:18.333
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE
ON FILE CLERK DUTY.

22:21.041 --> 22:23.000
- WH--I'M NOT TELLIN' HER.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.333
THIS CASE WAS SOLVED.

22:25.333 --> 22:27.417
IF I ASK HER TO REOPEN IT,

22:27.417 --> 22:29.500
I MAY AS WELL PUT
MY BALLS IN A VICE.

22:29.500 --> 22:32.166
AND NOT IN A HOT WAY EITHER.

22:32.166 --> 22:35.792
- WELL, THAT JUST LEAVES...ME.

22:45.625 --> 22:48.834
- HEY. YOU'RE LATE.

22:48.834 --> 22:51.166
- YEAH. TOUGH MORNING.

22:51.166 --> 22:54.333
ASTOR SHOWED UP
ON MY DOORSTEP LAST NIGHT

22:54.333 --> 22:56.333
DRUNK WITH A FRIEND.

22:56.333 --> 22:58.000
- HOW OLD'S THE FRIEND?

23:00.458 --> 23:02.500
JUST KIDDING.

23:07.792 --> 23:09.375
WHAT'S THAT?
BLOOD SAMPLE?

23:09.375 --> 23:11.500
- YES. IT'S A BLOOD SAMPLE.

23:14.166 --> 23:15.834
- TOP SECRET, HUH?
I GET IT.

23:15.834 --> 23:19.667
SO...WHAT IS IT?
BLOOD ALCOHOL FOR ASTOR?

23:19.667 --> 23:21.333
- SHE VOMITED
ALL OVER THE FLOOR.

23:21.333 --> 23:23.458
FURTHER TESTING'S
KIND OF UNNECESSARY.

23:23.458 --> 23:25.834
- STD PANEL?

23:25.834 --> 23:27.625
- VINCE, SHE'S 12.

23:27.625 --> 23:29.041
- I MEANT FOR YOU.

23:29.041 --> 23:30.959
[cell phone rings]

23:30.959 --> 23:32.667
- IT'S A HOMICIDE VICTIM

23:32.667 --> 23:34.875
I'M SUPPOSED TO HAVE
PROCESSED ALREADY.

23:34.875 --> 23:38.625
I MADE A MISTAKE,
FORGOT TO SUBMIT IT, OKAY?

23:38.625 --> 23:40.250
MORGAN.

23:40.250 --> 23:42.291
- DEXTER, THE GIRLS ARE GONE.

23:42.291 --> 23:44.417
- GONE WHERE?

23:44.417 --> 23:45.792
- I DON'T KNOW.
BUT THEY'RE MISSING.

23:45.792 --> 23:47.166
THEY FELT TERRIBLE,

23:47.166 --> 23:49.208
AND WE DIDN'T HAVE
ANY ADVIL IN THE HOUSE,

23:49.208 --> 23:50.667
SO I TOOK HARRISON
TO THE STORE.

23:50.667 --> 23:52.250
- YOU LEFT THEM ALONE?
- I WAS TRYING TO BE NICE.

23:52.250 --> 23:54.000
AND WHEN I GOT BACK,
THEY WERE GONE.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.667
- MAYBE THEY WENT FOR A WALK.
- I DON'T THINK SO.

23:56.667 --> 23:57.834
THE BACK DOOR WAS WIDE OPEN,

23:57.834 --> 24:00.041
AND THEIR CELL PHONES
ARE STILL HERE.

24:00.041 --> 24:01.583
DEXTER, WHAT 14-YEAR-OLD GIRL

24:01.583 --> 24:03.250
WILLINGLY LEAVES
HER CELL PHONE BEHIND?

24:03.250 --> 24:05.291
- DON'T MOVE.
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

24:05.291 --> 24:07.250
- I'M SO SORRY.
[beep]

24:20.125 --> 24:21.792
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

24:21.792 --> 24:24.208
- I WENT TO THE NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE
TO SEE IF HE SAW ANYTHING.

24:24.208 --> 24:25.750
- WHAT?
- HEY.

24:25.750 --> 24:27.750
SO I SAW SOME GUY
NEAR THE HOUSE.

24:27.750 --> 24:30.291
LIGHT HAIR, AVERAGE BUILD,
MID-30s.

24:30.291 --> 24:33.333
- LIKE COLE AND BOYD
AND DAN.

24:33.333 --> 24:34.625
- OH, HE HAD A WHITE PANEL VAN.

24:34.625 --> 24:36.333
AND IT WAS WEIRD ENOUGH
I CHECKED OUT THE PLATE.

24:36.333 --> 24:37.709
N4B SOMETHING.

24:37.709 --> 24:39.208
- WHY DIDN'T YOU STOP HIM?

24:39.208 --> 24:40.667
- I DIDN'T KNOW
THE GIRLS WERE IN THE HOUSE.

24:40.667 --> 24:42.583
I MEAN, I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
YOU HAD A TENANT.

24:42.583 --> 24:44.583
JUST THOUGHT HE WAS A--
A PAINTER OR SOMETHING.

24:44.583 --> 24:46.625
- WHICH IS WHY YOU THOUGHT
TO CHECK THE LICENSE PLATE?

24:46.625 --> 24:48.709
- WELL, NO, THAT'S JUST HABIT
FROM NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH.

24:48.709 --> 24:50.083
- THANKS.
- YEAH.

24:52.792 --> 24:54.083
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

24:54.083 --> 24:57.333
- LOOKING FOR SIGNS
OF A BREAK-IN.

24:57.333 --> 24:59.417
AN ABDUCTION--THAT'S WHAT
WE'RE THINKING HERE, RIGHT?

24:59.417 --> 25:01.000
- YEAH. BUT IT DOESN'T
MAKE ANY SENSE.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.333
- IT DOES IF SOMEONE
CAME LOOKING FOR US.

25:03.333 --> 25:05.208
- LIKE ONE OF JORDAN'S GUYS.

25:05.208 --> 25:06.834
- THERE'S A REASON
YOU WERE WORRIED LAST NIGHT

25:06.834 --> 25:08.333
WHEN YOU HEARD NOISES
IN THE HOUSE.

25:08.333 --> 25:10.375
- BUT I OVERREACTED.
IT WAS NOTHING.

25:10.375 --> 25:11.709
- ONLY THIS TIME
THERE WAS SOMEONE

25:11.709 --> 25:13.709
LURKING AROUND THE HOUSE.

25:15.166 --> 25:16.542
I SHOULDN'T HAVE STOLEN
THAT BLOOD SAMPLE.

25:16.542 --> 25:18.291
NOT WITH THE GIRLS HERE.

25:21.291 --> 25:22.875
WE NEED TO CALL THE COPS.

25:24.834 --> 25:27.000
- THEY'LL JUST START
ASKING QUESTIONS.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.542
AND IF IT DOES HAVE TO DO
WITH JORDAN,

25:28.542 --> 25:30.875
THEY'LL PROBABLY TRACE IT
ALL BACK TO US.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.417
[speed dial beeping]

25:34.417 --> 25:36.375
[line rings]
- METRO.

25:36.375 --> 25:38.500
- THIS IS DEXTER MORGAN
FROM HOMICIDE.

25:38.500 --> 25:41.500
I'D LIKE TO REPORT
A PROBABLE CHILD ABDUCTION.

25:41.500 --> 25:44.750
IT'S A WHITE PANEL VAN.
I HAVE A PARTIAL PLATE.

25:47.959 --> 25:49.709
- WE'VE ISSUED A BLANKET
APB ON THE VAN.

25:49.709 --> 25:52.709
NCIC HAS STARTED A FILE
ON THE GIRLS.

25:52.709 --> 25:54.417
- UNTIL WE GET THEM BACK
SAFELY,

25:54.417 --> 25:57.458
DETECTIVE LINKER WILL BE
OUR LIAISON TO MISSING PERSONS.

25:57.458 --> 25:58.959
- DID YOU CALL OLIVIA'S
PARENTS?

25:58.959 --> 26:00.375
- I TRIED.
I COULDN'T GET A HOLD OF THEM.

26:00.375 --> 26:02.458
- WHAT ABOUT ASTOR'S
GRANDPARENTS?

26:02.458 --> 26:03.709
- THEY HADN'T HEARD FROM HER.

26:03.709 --> 26:05.583
I DIDN'T TELL THEM
SHE WAS MISSING, THOUGH.

26:05.583 --> 26:06.917
DIDN'T WANT TO WORRY THEM.

26:06.917 --> 26:08.917
YET.
- MOST MISSING CHILDREN

26:08.917 --> 26:11.125
ARE ABDUCTED BY SOMEONE
THE PARENTS KNOW.

26:11.125 --> 26:13.083
IS THERE ANYONE
YOU CAN THINK OF?

26:13.083 --> 26:14.375
- NO. NOBODY.

26:14.375 --> 26:17.709
- YOU SURE?
NO ONE NEW?

26:17.709 --> 26:20.375
- WHERE WERE YOU, ANYWAY,
WHEN THEY WERE TAKEN?

26:20.375 --> 26:22.000
- I CAN'T LIE ABOUT THIS.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.375
NOT WITH ASTOR'S LIFE
ON THE LINE.

26:24.375 --> 26:26.917
I WAS WITH JORDAN CHASE.

26:30.417 --> 26:32.917
HE...OFFERED ME SOME

26:32.917 --> 26:35.500
PRIVATE SESSIONS
TO HELP DEAL WITH...

26:35.500 --> 26:37.709
RITA'S DEATH.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.291
WHAT?

26:42.875 --> 26:45.583
- A LOT OF FUCKED UP PEOPLE
CIRCLING THAT GUY, DEX.

26:45.583 --> 26:48.250
- A LOT? WHO?

26:48.250 --> 26:49.458
BESIDES BOYD FOWLER.

26:49.458 --> 26:51.417
- WELL, HIS HEAD OF SECURITY
FOR ONE.

26:51.417 --> 26:53.792
- I THOUGHT WE CLEARED HIM.

26:53.792 --> 26:55.375
- MAY HAVE BEEN PREMATURE.

26:55.375 --> 26:57.125
- OKAY...WHAT'S GOING ON?

26:57.125 --> 27:00.250
- THE BARREL GIRLS CASE MIGHT
NOT BE AS CLOSED AS WE THOUGHT.

27:00.250 --> 27:02.542
- CAN WE JUST FIND THE VAN?

27:04.333 --> 27:06.792
- [ahem]

27:15.375 --> 27:17.291
[police radio chatter]

27:23.208 --> 27:27.500
[alarm whoops]

27:27.500 --> 27:29.125
- DON'T MOVE!
- SHOW ME YOUR HANDS!

27:29.125 --> 27:30.792
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!
WHAT--WHAT'S GOING ON?

27:30.792 --> 27:33.125
- ON YOUR KNEES!
HANDS ON YOUR HEAD NOW!

27:33.125 --> 27:34.959
YEAH, RIGHT THERE.

27:34.959 --> 27:36.417
- WHO IS HE?

27:36.417 --> 27:38.000
- NAME'S BARRY KURT.
NO PRIORS.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.625
THEY FOUND HIM AT
A GAS STATION ON CORAL.

27:44.250 --> 27:45.667
- WHERE'S ASTOR?
- HEY--EASY!

27:45.667 --> 27:47.333
- IF YOU HURT HER,
I'LL KILL YOU.

27:47.333 --> 27:48.750
I'LL KILL YOU.
- GET YOUR HANDS OFF OF ME.

27:48.750 --> 27:51.333
- YOU UNDERSTAND ME?
- HE'S LOOKING FOR THE GIRLS

27:51.333 --> 27:53.041
JUST LIKE YOU.
- HE'S WHAT?

27:53.041 --> 27:55.000
- I'M OLIVIA'S FATHER.
SORT OF, ANYWAY.

27:55.000 --> 27:56.834
I LIVE WITH HER MOM.

27:56.834 --> 27:58.667
- [exhales]

27:58.667 --> 28:01.000
M ASTOR'S STEPFATHER,
DEXTER MORGAN.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.667
- YEAH. YOU SHOULD
TRY TO CALM DOWN.

28:02.667 --> 28:04.709
- HE THOUGHT SOMETHING
HAPPENED TO HIS DAUGHTER.

28:04.709 --> 28:07.417
- SOMETHING IS GONNA HAPPEN
TO THEM WHEN I FIND THEM.

28:07.417 --> 28:09.792
OLIVIA BROKE INTO
OUR LIQUOR CABINET,

28:09.792 --> 28:11.625
STOLE MONEY FROM HER MOTHER,
AND TOOK OFF.

28:11.625 --> 28:13.750
WE'VE GOT GPS TRACKING
ON HER MOBILE PHONE.

28:13.750 --> 28:16.166
I FOLLOWED IT TO YOUR HOUSE,
BUT THEY WEREN'T THERE.

28:16.166 --> 28:18.417
I FIGURED I'D GAS UP THE VAN
AND GO BACK.

28:18.417 --> 28:20.875
NEXT THING I KNOW,
I'M ON MY KNEES IN CUFFS

28:20.875 --> 28:23.625
LIKE SOME LOSER ON COPS.

28:23.625 --> 28:25.333
- SO WHERE ARE THEY?

28:25.333 --> 28:26.959
- PROBABLY CAUSING TROUBLE
SOMEWHERE.

28:26.959 --> 28:28.500
EVER SINCE ASTOR
MOVED DOWN THE BLOCK,

28:28.500 --> 28:32.041
OLIVIA'S BEEN NOTHING
BUT A PAIN IN THE ASS.

28:32.041 --> 28:33.917
[cell phone rings]

28:33.917 --> 28:35.125
- MORGAN.

28:35.125 --> 28:37.417
- IS HE ALWAYS THIS VIOLENT?

28:38.875 --> 28:40.709
- THEY FOUND THE GIRLS
AT BAYSIDE.

28:40.709 --> 28:42.333
THEY'RE HOLDING THEM
FOR SHOPLIFTING.

28:54.750 --> 28:56.166
ASTOR?

28:57.875 --> 28:59.041
- THANK GOD.

28:59.041 --> 29:01.166
WE HAD THE WHOLE DEPARTMENT
LOOKING FOR YOU.

29:01.166 --> 29:02.375
WE WERE SO WORRIED.

29:02.375 --> 29:03.875
- YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU
PUT US THROUGH TODAY.

29:03.875 --> 29:06.875
- I'M SORRY.
- WHAT WERE YOU EVEN THINKING

29:06.875 --> 29:09.166
RUNNING OFF LIKE THAT?
- SHOPLIFTING?

29:09.166 --> 29:10.625
THAT FIGURES.

29:10.625 --> 29:11.875
- WE DIDN'T STEAL ANYTHING.
I SWEAR.

29:11.875 --> 29:13.583
- I JUST TRIED ON A RING
AND FORGOT ABOUT IT.

29:13.583 --> 29:16.667
IT WAS A MISTAKE.
I GAVE IT BACK.

29:16.667 --> 29:18.625
- I'M DETECTIVE
DEBRA MORGAN

29:18.625 --> 29:19.583
FROM MIAMI METRO HOMICIDE.

29:19.583 --> 29:21.959
MIND IF I TAKE IT
FROM HERE?

29:21.959 --> 29:24.959
- JUST MAKE SURE I DON'T
SEE THESE TWO AGAIN.

29:29.792 --> 29:31.375
- COME ON, WE'RE GOING HOME.
- NO!

29:31.375 --> 29:32.959
- NOW.
- MY STUFF'S AT ASTOR'S.

29:32.959 --> 29:35.125
I NEED TO GO WITH HER.
- YOU NEED TO COME WITH ME.

29:35.125 --> 29:37.333
- I DON'T WANT TO.
- TELL YOU WHAT.

29:37.333 --> 29:38.583
THEIR STUFF IS AT MY HOUSE.

29:38.583 --> 29:40.291
WHY DON'T I TAKE THEM THERE,
GET THEM PACKED.

29:40.291 --> 29:41.792
WE'LL MEET YOU IN AN HOUR.

29:41.792 --> 29:44.417
YOU'RE GONNA NEED TO GET YOUR
VAN OUT OF IMPOUND ANYWAY.

29:44.417 --> 29:46.583
- WHICH YOU'RE PAYING FOR,
BY THE WAY.

29:46.583 --> 29:47.917
- WE'LL MEET YOU
AT THE ROADSIDE CAFE.

29:47.917 --> 29:51.083
IT'S RIGHT NEAR IMPOUND.
- GREAT.

29:52.417 --> 29:55.333
TEENAGERS.
THEY CAN MAKE YOU HOMICIDAL.

29:55.333 --> 29:57.417
- I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

30:05.500 --> 30:06.875
- YOU WANTED TO SEE ME?
- YEAH.

30:06.875 --> 30:08.542
YOU WANNA TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU

30:08.542 --> 30:11.041
AND DETECTIVE MORGAN?

30:11.041 --> 30:13.583
- NOTHING.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

30:13.583 --> 30:16.959
- OBVIOUSLY, YOU'VE BEEN TALKING
ABOUT THE BARREL GIRLS CASE.

30:16.959 --> 30:19.250
- WE FOUND SOME NEW EVIDENCE.

30:19.250 --> 30:21.583
- YOU AND DETECTIVE MORGAN.

30:21.583 --> 30:23.542
- SHE DID.
IN THE FILE ROOM.

30:23.542 --> 30:27.291
I WAS GOING TO TELL YOU.

30:27.291 --> 30:28.792
WHAT?

30:28.792 --> 30:30.125
- YOU REALLY DON'T SEE
WHAT'S GOING ON?

30:30.125 --> 30:34.625
I SEND HER TO THE FILE ROOM
WITH ONE ASSIGNMENT--FILE.

30:34.625 --> 30:36.875
AND THEN SHE MAGICALLY
FINDS EVIDENCE

30:36.875 --> 30:39.500
TO REOPEN A CASE
SHE KNOWS I PERSONALLY CLOSED.

30:39.500 --> 30:42.375
- MARIA...IT'S DNA.

30:42.375 --> 30:44.166
IT'S NOT LIKE SHE MADE IT UP.

30:44.166 --> 30:47.834
- SHE'S TRYING TO GET BACK
AT ME.

30:47.834 --> 30:50.792
WE PINNED THIS
ON BOYD FOWLER.

30:50.792 --> 30:53.125
I HAD FIVE DETECTIVES
TELL ME HE'S THE ONE.

30:53.125 --> 30:56.250
- AND NOW I AM TELLING YOU
THAT IT'S MORE COMPLICATED.

30:56.250 --> 30:59.834
YOU NEED TO REOPEN THE CASE.
- I DISAGREE.

30:59.834 --> 31:03.166
CHANGING FIVE NAMES
ON THE MURDER BOARD

31:03.166 --> 31:05.500
FROM BLACK TO RED ISN'T
GONNA HELP THIS DEPARTMENT.

31:05.500 --> 31:08.500
- THE DEPARTMENT?
OR YOU?

31:14.166 --> 31:15.709
- WHAT HAPPENED?

31:15.709 --> 31:18.625
- UH...THERE WERE AT BAYSIDE.

31:18.625 --> 31:21.041
- OH, THANK GOD.
- SHOPLIFTING.

31:22.709 --> 31:25.917
- YOU GONNA INTRODUCE US?

31:27.792 --> 31:29.166
- THAT'S THE ONE I WAS
TELLING YOU ABOUT.

31:29.166 --> 31:31.959
HIS NEW GIRLFRIEND.

31:31.959 --> 31:33.250
- SHE'S MY TENANT.

31:33.250 --> 31:34.750
[sighs]

31:34.750 --> 31:37.208
LUMEN, THIS IS
MY SISTER DEBRA.

31:37.208 --> 31:39.000
DEB, LUMEN.

31:41.083 --> 31:42.750
- I DIDN'T KNOW
HE HAD A TENANT.

31:42.750 --> 31:44.917
- DIDN'T KNOW
HE HAD A SISTER.

31:50.625 --> 31:53.375
- I'M GONNA...

31:53.375 --> 31:55.500
GO CHECK ON THE GIRLS.

31:58.291 --> 32:00.709
- SERIOUSLY?

32:00.709 --> 32:02.125
THAT'S YOUR TENANT?

32:02.125 --> 32:04.583
- YES.
- OH.

32:04.583 --> 32:07.375
WHERE'S ALL HER STUFF?

32:07.375 --> 32:10.417
- SHE HASN'T REALLY
MOVED IN YET.

32:10.417 --> 32:13.542
- BUT YOU KNOW HER WELL ENOUGH
TO TRUST HER WITH YOUR SON.

32:13.542 --> 32:14.709
- IT WAS AN EMERGENCY.

32:14.709 --> 32:16.166
I THOUGHT THE GIRLS
HAD BEEN TAKEN.

32:16.166 --> 32:18.041
- WHY ARE YOU KEEPING HER
A SECRET?

32:18.041 --> 32:19.083
- I'M NOT.

32:19.083 --> 32:20.542
- REALLY?
'CAUSE AT THE STATION

32:20.542 --> 32:22.041
WE ASKED YOU WHO YOU WERE
SPENDING YOUR TIME WITH.

32:22.041 --> 32:23.709
YOU DIDN'T THINK TO MENTION
THE HOT BLONDE

32:23.709 --> 32:25.792
THAT'S LIVING IN YOUR HOUSE?

32:25.792 --> 32:27.583
- DIDN'T SEEM...
LIKE IT MATTERED.

32:27.583 --> 32:29.583
OBVIOUSLY,
SHE DIDN'T TAKE THE GIRLS.

32:29.583 --> 32:32.458
- THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

32:32.458 --> 32:34.083
I'M NOT JUDGING YOU.

32:34.083 --> 32:36.125
BELIEVE ME, I UNDERSTAND REBOUND
AS MUCH AS ANYBODY.

32:36.125 --> 32:38.291
BUT DON'T YOU THINK
IT'S A LITTLE SOON?

32:38.291 --> 32:39.667
- I'M NOT ON ANY REBOUND.

32:39.667 --> 32:41.667
- COME ON.
SHE'S YOUR TENANT?

32:41.667 --> 32:43.250
REALLY?

32:43.250 --> 32:46.000
- THERE'S NOTHING GOING ON.

32:46.000 --> 32:47.792
- FINE.

32:47.792 --> 32:49.750
I GIVE UP.

32:49.750 --> 32:53.458
I GOTTA GET BACK
TO THE STATION.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.667
- DEB KNOWS ABOUT
MY PARTNER IN CRIME.

32:57.667 --> 33:00.625
THE WHOLE STATION KNOWS
I'M SEEING JORDAN CHASE.

- YOU PROTECTED ASTOR,

44:30.166 --> 44:32.667
PUT YOURSELF OUT THERE
FOR ANOTHER PERSON.

44:32.667 --> 44:36.625
I HAD NO IDEA
YOU HAD THAT IN YOU.

44:38.667 --> 44:40.083
I UNDERESTIMATED YOU.

44:40.083 --> 44:41.875
ASSUMED YOU WERE
A MONSTER

44:41.875 --> 44:44.458
WHEN YOU WERE CAPABLE

44:44.458 --> 44:46.875
OF SO MUCH MORE.

44:49.041 --> 44:50.500
IF ONLY I'D SEEN THAT,

44:50.500 --> 44:52.458
MAYBE I WOULDN'T HAVE
LED YOU DOWN THIS PATH.

45:07.500 --> 45:08.583
- DEB?

45:08.583 --> 45:10.291
- HI, HONEY.

45:18.500 --> 45:20.041
- GET THE FUCK
OUT OF MY APARTMENT.

45:20.041 --> 45:21.166
- I BROUGHT YOU
A PRESENT.

45:21.166 --> 45:23.041
DON'T YOU
WANT TO SEE WHAT IT IS?

45:23.041 --> 45:24.875

45:24.875 --> 45:27.917

AT 3:00 A.M. IN THE MORNING,

45:27.917 --> 45:29.917
AND THEY ARE NOT FUCKING.

45:29.917 --> 45:31.291
- WHAT'S IN THE BAGS?

45:31.291 --> 45:32.542
- SOMETHING HEAVY.

45:32.542 --> 45:33.834
I'M THINKING NARCOTICS,
MAYBE A BODY.

45:36.667 --> 45:37.750
- ARE YOU CRAZY?

45:37.750 --> 45:39.875
- YEAH, BUT THAT'S
BESIDE THE POINT.

45:39.875 --> 45:42.041
POINT IS THAT
WHEN THEY CAME BACK,

45:42.041 --> 45:43.458
THOSE BAGS WERE GONE,

45:43.458 --> 45:45.667
SO WHATEVER THEY'RE HIDING,
IT'S SOMETHING BIG.

45:45.667 --> 45:48.333
- THIS WAS A BAD IDEA.

45:49.709 --> 45:53.083
HERE. CONSIDER THIS
YOUR SEVERANCE PACKAGE.

45:53.083 --> 45:54.792
WE'RE DONE.

45:55.875 --> 45:57.750

45:57.750 --> 46:00.709

46:02.083 --> 46:04.583

46:04.583 --> 46:07.792
- AND I'M SAYIN' BULLSHIT.

46:07.792 --> 46:09.959
IF THIS THING IS AS BIG
AS I THINK IT IS,

46:09.959 --> 46:12.500
LAGUERTA AND ALL THEM
OTHER DOUCHEBAGS IN HOMICIDE

46:12.500 --> 46:13.917

KISSING MY ASS.

46:13.917 --> 46:15.125
- BACK OFF, LIDDY.

46:15.125 --> 46:16.583
I MEAN IT.

46:16.583 --> 46:19.792

46:21.542 --> 46:26.041

46:33.917 --> 46:36.583
AND STAY THE FUCK

46:40.834 --> 46:42.667
- [chuckles]

47:11.625 --> 47:14.625
- SO YOU REALLY DID
CHANGE YOUR MIND.

47:14.625 --> 47:16.417
- I READ THE REPORT.

47:18.208 --> 47:19.625
- THANK YOU.

47:19.625 --> 47:21.041
- DOES THIS MEAN...

47:23.333 --> 47:25.458
YOU'LL STOP SLEEPING
ON THE COUCH?

47:27.625 --> 47:30.458
- WE STILL GOT
A LONG WAY TO GO

47:30.458 --> 47:32.959
BETWEEN THE COUCH
AND THE BEDROOM, MARIA.

47:40.959 --> 47:42.875
- SO, WHAT, NOW YOU'RE
NOT EVEN TALKING TO ME?

47:46.458 --> 47:49.417
DEB, LOOK,
I HAD AN IDIOT THEORY

47:49.417 --> 47:51.750
AND I DROPPED IT.

47:51.750 --> 47:53.792
- YEAH, BECAUSE
LAGUERTA SUSPENDED YOU.

47:53.792 --> 47:56.875
- NO, BECAUSE I WAS WRONG.

47:56.875 --> 47:59.291
LOOK, WHAT I SAID
YESTERDAY IS TRUE.

47:59.291 --> 48:00.583
I LOVE YOU,

48:00.583 --> 48:02.208
AND I'M NOT TAKING
IT BACK.

48:04.750 --> 48:06.208
- YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS.

48:06.208 --> 48:08.458
- IT MEANS I'D NEVER DO
ANYTHING TO HURT YOU.

48:08.458 --> 48:10.667
EVER.

48:10.667 --> 48:13.000
- I TRUSTED YOU.

48:13.000 --> 48:14.458
AND WHILE YOU WERE
FUCKING ME,

48:14.458 --> 48:16.667
YOU WERE SPREADING SHIT
ABOUT MY BROTHER BEHIND MY BACK.

48:16.667 --> 48:19.208
YOU THINK
THAT'S NOT HURTING ME?

48:19.208 --> 48:20.750
FUCK YOU.

48:41.000 --> 48:43.208
- YOU WANT US
TO COME INSIDE WITH YOU?

48:43.208 --> 48:45.125
- NO, I'LL BE OKAY.

48:45.125 --> 48:46.750
I COULD BARELY UNDERSTAND
MY MOM ON THE PHONE

48:46.750 --> 48:48.333
WITH ALL THE CRYING,

48:48.333 --> 48:51.458
BUT SHE ACTUALLY SAID
BARRY DID HER A FAVOR LEAVING.

48:51.458 --> 48:53.000
HE DEFINITELY
DID ME A FAVOR.

48:53.000 --> 48:54.750
HE TOLD HER
SHE HAS A FAT ASS.

48:54.750 --> 48:55.792
[laughs]

48:55.792 --> 48:57.250
HE IS NOT COMING BACK.

49:05.417 --> 49:06.542
THANK YOU.

49:06.542 --> 49:08.792
CALL YOU LATER.

49:18.417 --> 49:19.917
[engine starts]

49:48.625 --> 49:50.375

50:25.083 --> 50:26.959

YOUR TENANT, THOUGH.

50:26.959 --> 50:29.458

50:29.458 --> 50:34.291
WHO'S BEEN
THROUGH SOME REALLY...

50:34.291 --> 50:35.583
REALLY BAD STUFF.

50:35.583 --> 50:38.917
I'M HELPING HER
DEAL WITH IT.

50:38.917 --> 50:42.000
- DOES IT MAKE YOU
FEEL BETTER?

50:42.000 --> 50:43.667
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

50:43.667 --> 50:45.375
- ABOUT MOM.

50:45.375 --> 50:46.917
BEING THERE FOR LUMEN,

50:46.917 --> 50:50.083
DOES IT MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO MOM?

51:00.875 --> 51:02.500
- I LOVE YOU.

51:04.750 --> 51:06.417

51:09.542 --> 51:10.834
- YOU SHOULD COME IN,

51:10.834 --> 51:13.667

51:13.667 --> 51:15.458

51:15.458 --> 51:16.834
ABOUT MIAMI.

51:29.208 --> 51:30.250

51:31.500 --> 51:33.375
- THIS IS MAMA?

51:34.458 --> 51:36.125
- MAMA.

51:39.000 --> 51:40.250
- OKAY, BUD.

51:43.917 --> 51:45.750
JORDAN CHASE TOLD ME
TO FIGURE OUT

51:45.750 --> 51:48.583
WHAT I WANT MOST.

51:48.583 --> 51:50.750
THE ANSWER IS SIMPLE.

51:50.750 --> 51:54.834
TO BE A GOOD DAD.

51:54.834 --> 51:56.125
BUT NOW THAT ASTOR'S SAFE,

51:56.125 --> 51:58.959
