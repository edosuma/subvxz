15:32.932 --> 15:35.238
- [ Dawn ]
  It's Buffy's--
- [ Xander ] Ex.

15:35.325 --> 15:39.460
And I'm thinking
it's a little more
complicated than just that.

15:39.547 --> 15:41.765
[ Xander ] Always is.You've changed.

15:41.852 --> 15:45.335
- I have.
- New clothing.
 Better hair.

15:45.422 --> 15:47.729
Not so much
with the crazy.
I like it.

15:47.816 --> 15:49.948
Now what do you want? Easy.

15:50.036 --> 15:52.777
If you think I like
putting myself here,

15:52.864 --> 15:56.476
surrounded by people who don't
particularly like me,
you'd be wrong.

15:56.563 --> 15:59.959
If you're uncomfortable,
we can make you leave.

16:00.046 --> 16:04.658
I'll be quick.
We need to talk.
Wanna do that here or privately?

16:04.745 --> 16:07.749
I'm thinking here, in the company of good friends and pointy weapons.

16:07.836 --> 16:10.186
-[ Buffy ]  You said something about quick? -[ Spike ] I did.

16:11.666 --> 16:14.234
Before I start,
and for the record,

16:14.321 --> 16:16.583
last you saw me,
I was a mess,

16:16.671 --> 16:20.153
out of my head--
admitted.

16:20.240 --> 16:22.633
Last week, living in
the school basement,

16:23.938 --> 16:26.375
well, you saw me.

16:28.335 --> 16:31.337
You did?

16:31.424 --> 16:34.036
Guys, just a second,
okay? Yes, I saw Spike.
I just didn't think--

16:34.123 --> 16:36.908
What? You just...
forgot to mention it?

16:36.995 --> 16:40.042
Things were insane
in the basement.
I saved your life.

16:40.129 --> 16:42.479
- We can discuss this later.
- Sure.

16:42.566 --> 16:45.091
- [ Xander ]  Whatever you want.- [ Dawn ] Right.

16:45.177 --> 16:48.181
'Cause that seems to be
the only time you let us in,
Buffy, whenever you want.

16:48.268 --> 16:50.573
- Now, in fairness to Buffy--
- Shut up, Spike!

16:50.661 --> 16:54.013
[ Buffy Sighs ]
Okay. Guys,
give us a second.

17:03.847 --> 17:07.374
Do not start by
saying you're sorry.I didn't come here to atone.

17:07.461 --> 17:09.288
- What the hell do you want?
- I'm here to help you.

17:09.375 --> 17:12.074
- Help me what?
- I was hoping you'd tell me.

17:12.161 --> 17:17.818
You're the Slayer,
connected to the visions,
long line of worthies, right?

17:17.905 --> 17:21.126
I'm just a guy
with his ear to the ground,
but even I can feel it.

17:21.213 --> 17:25.608
Something's coming.
I don't know what exactly,
but something's brewing.

17:25.694 --> 17:28.786
It's so big, ugly and damned,
it makes you and me look like
little, bitty puzzle pieces.

17:31.136 --> 17:34.617
If I'm wrong, say so.
Lovely. No hard feelings.

17:34.704 --> 17:38.709
I'll go out that door.
You can lock it behind me
with any spell you like.

17:38.796 --> 17:44.279
So? Am I wrong?Everything about you
is wrong, Spike.

17:47.021 --> 17:49.111
But something is coming.

17:52.288 --> 17:57.031
You're gonna need some help.Since when did you become
the champion of the people?

17:57.118 --> 17:59.077
I didn't. I'm just a guy
who can lend a hand
if you'll let me.

18:01.471 --> 18:03.343
Ball's in your court,
Slayer.

18:06.301 --> 18:08.782
Okay. We're gonna split.
Two pairs.

18:08.869 --> 18:11.263
Whatever this creature is,
it's burrowing
through solid ground.

18:11.351 --> 18:13.743
That means a strength
and power that we don't
usually deal with,

18:13.830 --> 18:17.096
but we may have to get
used to, now the Hellmouth
is getting all perky.

18:17.182 --> 18:20.882
Shouldn't we call
the police or something?And tell them?

18:20.969 --> 18:23.840
I'll stop interrupting.

18:23.928 --> 18:27.018
[ Buffy ]
Xander, take Nancy home.
Drive, don't walk.

18:27.105 --> 18:29.194
And try not to stop
till you get there. Understood.

18:29.281 --> 18:31.458
Is your girlfriend
always this... commanding?

18:31.545 --> 18:34.329
Who?

18:34.416 --> 18:36.984
Buffy?

18:37.072 --> 18:39.596
Oh, no, no, no. See,
uh-- I mean, she's--

18:39.682 --> 18:44.252
She's a girl and--
and she's a friend,
but she's not my girlfriend.

18:44.339 --> 18:46.646
Xander?
A little drool.

18:50.867 --> 18:53.044
Spike and I will
check out the scene. [ Xander ] Okay.

18:53.132 --> 18:55.960
In the biggest way,
I am not loving this plan.

18:56.047 --> 19:00.355
I'm not loving Spike.
[ Softly ]
He tried to rape you.

19:00.442 --> 19:03.054
And he failed.
I know I can take him.

19:03.142 --> 19:06.405
Xander, take Nancy home.
Spike and I will patrol.

19:08.190 --> 19:12.019
I'm command central,
so everybody check in with me.

19:12.106 --> 19:15.675
Okay. I'll be here doing
my homework, but the other one
sounded cooler.

19:15.762 --> 19:17.852
Be safe.
Let's go.

19:19.854 --> 19:22.551
Righty-o, then.

19:22.638 --> 19:25.032
Spike?

19:27.383 --> 19:32.126
You sleep, right?
You. Vampires.
You sleep.

19:32.213 --> 19:34.868
Yeah.
What's your point, niblet?

19:34.955 --> 19:37.219
Well, I can't take you
in a fight or anything,

19:37.306 --> 19:41.309
even with a chip
in your head,
but you do sleep.

19:41.396 --> 19:45.531
If you hurt my sister
at all, touch her,

19:45.618 --> 19:47.403
you're gonna wake up
on fire.

19:53.887 --> 19:57.847
[ Spike ]
You're awfully quiet.Wouldn't know what to say.

19:57.934 --> 20:01.982
Fine with me. I was
more than half expecting
to get an earful anyway.

20:02.069 --> 20:07.554
And when exactly did your sister
get unbelievably scary?What are you doing?

20:07.641 --> 20:13.080
What? I told you once,
straight up-- I'm here
to help and that's all.

20:13.167 --> 20:17.040
Think this here's
our spot? How'd you guess?

20:17.127 --> 20:19.521
I don't fancy
sticking my head
in that.

20:19.608 --> 20:22.221
Well, if something
bites it off,
that'd be a clue.

20:23.787 --> 20:25.659
[ Sighs ]

20:33.057 --> 20:34.971
So what happened to you?

20:35.058 --> 20:37.452
Well, you saw me.

20:37.539 --> 20:41.631
Those ghostly types
in the school basement
got in my head.

20:41.718 --> 20:45.374
They made me flat-out,
bug-shaggin' crazy.

20:45.461 --> 20:49.029
And I'm not exactly bragging
about it, but they were
stronger than I was--

20:49.116 --> 20:51.945
made me see things,
do things.

20:54.601 --> 20:56.516
And how come you never
told anyone you saw me?

20:56.603 --> 21:01.433
I don't know.
 I guess...

21:01.520 --> 21:04.000
I was partly hoping
you were some kind
of mirage.

21:04.087 --> 21:07.788
- Sorry to disappoint.
- Not your fault.

21:07.875 --> 21:10.355
Hold the torch,
will you?

21:15.273 --> 21:17.101
[ Straining ]

21:21.192 --> 21:25.153
[ Sighs ]
Look. This-- us working
together. It's not a way...

21:25.240 --> 21:27.589
for us to get back together,
if that's what you want.

21:27.676 --> 21:29.417
It's not.

21:31.289 --> 21:33.335
Look. I can't blame you
for being all skittish.

21:33.422 --> 21:37.034
Skittish? That's not a word
I would use for it.

21:38.339 --> 21:40.167
You tried to rape me.

21:41.996 --> 21:46.086
- I don't have the words.
- Neither do I.

21:46.173 --> 21:50.047
I can't say "Sorry."
 I can't use "Forgive me."

21:51.483 --> 21:55.662
All I can say is,
Buffy, I've changed.

21:55.749 --> 21:59.143
- I believe you.
- Well, that's something.

21:59.230 --> 22:01.624
I just don't know what you've changed into.

22:03.583 --> 22:06.063
You come back to town,
you make with
the big surprises.

22:06.150 --> 22:09.545
Twice. I don't know what your game is, Spike,

22:09.632 --> 22:11.894
but I know
there's something
you're not telling me.

22:11.981 --> 22:14.636
You're right.
There is.

22:17.378 --> 22:20.338
But we're not best friends
anymore, so too bad for me.
I'm not sharing.

22:21.775 --> 22:23.690
We've been through things--

22:23.777 --> 22:25.909
the end of the world
and back.

22:25.996 --> 22:28.825
I can be useful
'cause, honestly, I've got
nothing better to do.

22:28.912 --> 22:31.349
Make use of me
if you want.

22:33.613 --> 22:36.920
And there's nothing here.
Just a bit of slime.

22:37.007 --> 22:39.401
Mounds of displaced dirt
and such.

22:39.488 --> 22:41.837
Whatever our beastie is,
he's gone.

22:51.020 --> 22:52.848
[ Sighs ]

23:00.682 --> 23:04.383
Boy. I still can't believe
that all of this
is happening.

23:04.470 --> 23:08.734
I mean, even with this town's
reputation for, you know,
unexplained weirdness.

23:08.821 --> 23:12.391
Right. Sunnydale.
Come for the food.
Stay for the dismemberment.

23:12.478 --> 23:15.088
There's good food?

23:16.438 --> 23:19.528
Well, thanks.
[ Clears Throat ]

23:21.574 --> 23:23.792
And that's a couple of levels
of lameness right there--

23:23.880 --> 23:27.536
me saying "thanks"
after everything that
you've done for me tonight.

23:27.623 --> 23:30.844
Well, you could slip me
a 20, but then I'd have
to act all offended.

23:30.931 --> 23:33.324
Got it. So,

23:33.412 --> 23:36.414
um, do you think
I might instead...

23:36.501 --> 23:38.590
give you a call
some time?

23:38.677 --> 23:41.157
Just to check in?No, actually
I'm hitting on you.

23:41.244 --> 23:43.509
Even better.
I'm very listed.

23:43.596 --> 23:47.903
And I'm really pushy,
so that works out well
then.

23:47.990 --> 23:50.777
[ Sighs ]

23:50.864 --> 23:54.301
Good night.Uh--

23:54.388 --> 23:57.131
[ Rumbling ]

23:57.218 --> 23:58.653
Nancy--

24:01.743 --> 24:03.442
I just got
a swell idea.

24:04.703 --> 24:06.967
Run![ Screams ]

24:12.058 --> 24:14.365
[ Roaring ]

24:16.715 --> 24:18.544
[ Screaming ]

24:25.986 --> 24:29.510
Are you okay?I just--

24:29.597 --> 24:31.730
Dumb question.
Are you injured?
Are you hurt?

24:33.384 --> 24:35.647
I don't think so.
 I just--

24:35.734 --> 24:38.214
I don't think that I can
take any more of this.

24:40.695 --> 24:43.176
Two attacks
in the same night.

24:43.263 --> 24:46.048
I'm starting to think
it's not coincidence.

24:46.135 --> 24:49.226
Oh, sure. Why not?
A monster trying to kill me.

24:49.313 --> 24:53.403
It's just the thing
that was missing to make
my life absolutely perfect.

24:53.491 --> 24:57.191
Oh. Ronnie would
love this. Boy.Right.

25:00.106 --> 25:03.936
Who's Ronnie?Oh, um,

25:04.023 --> 25:08.419
only my psycho ex-boyfriend
that I've been trying to get
rid of for the past few weeks.

25:08.507 --> 25:10.290
[ Sighs ]
I almost prefer
the monster.

25:10.377 --> 25:14.076
Ronnie was,
um, trouble.

25:14.163 --> 25:16.818
Uh-huh.
And I'm just curious--

25:16.905 --> 25:22.259
Was this Ronnie guy
a borrowing money kind
of trouble, or...

25:22.346 --> 25:25.914
was he a raising demon
trouble kind of guy?

25:27.526 --> 25:29.919
Oh. Ronnie?
He couldn't.

25:31.529 --> 25:34.357
He just--

25:34.444 --> 25:38.624
He was an abusive bastard
is the catchy headline.

25:38.711 --> 25:40.451
And he'd just show up,
even after--

25:42.932 --> 25:45.107
You know the feeling
that you get...

25:45.194 --> 25:48.634
when your ex is constantly
ruining every part of your life,
and it just doesn't stop?

25:49.721 --> 25:52.115
Yes.

25:52.201 --> 25:56.423
And you get so tired of feeling
helpless that all you can do
is just wish that it would stop?

25:58.644 --> 26:00.732
Wish?

26:00.819 --> 26:03.038
And it's not the fact
that he cheated.

26:03.125 --> 26:05.519
It's the way he cheated,
you know?

26:05.606 --> 26:08.740
I mean, we could've talked.
 I could've handled it.

26:08.827 --> 26:11.569
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
I get it. Go on.

26:11.656 --> 26:15.398
You know what he is?
He's spineless. Yeah, that's it.

26:15.486 --> 26:18.924
He's-- He's like this
spineless little pig.

26:19.011 --> 26:22.189
And you know
what I wish?God, do I want to.

26:29.500 --> 26:33.679
You were saying?Um, I want
more quesadillas?

26:33.766 --> 26:35.984
Before that.A margarita.

26:36.072 --> 26:40.336
After that.Oh, yeah. God,
my boyfriend's spineless.

26:40.423 --> 26:43.818
He should just--

26:43.905 --> 26:47.823
You know, he should
just be spineless for real.No spine. Got it. I can do that.

26:47.910 --> 26:50.695
What do you mean?See, honey,

26:50.782 --> 26:54.002
what I'm driving us
towards here is sometimes,
don't you just wish that--

26:54.089 --> 26:55.875
Oh, penis.

26:57.615 --> 26:59.748
Is this the one
you talked to?

26:59.835 --> 27:03.230
I tell you what.
Why don't we put
a pin in it?

27:03.317 --> 27:06.929
Why don't you go get yourself
a drink, and we'll pick it up
in a few? Okay?

27:10.846 --> 27:13.935
You guys,
I am workinghere.We noticed.

27:14.022 --> 27:17.243
- It's why we're here.
- [ Xander ]
  Right.

27:17.330 --> 27:20.508
Did you turn
this nice lady's ex
into a giant worm monster?

27:20.595 --> 27:23.642
[ Chuckles ]
Yes.

27:23.729 --> 27:27.340
No way. Are you saying that that thing was Ronnie?

27:27.428 --> 27:29.385
You wish it. I dish it.
I thought we were
clear on this.

27:29.472 --> 27:31.561
I didn't think
you were gonna go
all narc on me.

27:31.650 --> 27:33.607
You wished your ex was a worm?

27:33.694 --> 27:35.609
We were just talking.

27:35.697 --> 27:39.440
Anya has a way
of making things happen.

27:39.527 --> 27:42.616
I had a quota.
The guy had it coming.
What's the big?

27:42.703 --> 27:45.794
- I think I'm gonna be sick.
- Anya, that thing
 you created...

27:45.881 --> 27:47.796
burst through solid pavement
and ate her dog.

27:49.450 --> 27:51.582
Oh! Puppy! Wait.

27:51.670 --> 27:54.367
That gets your sad noise?
People's lives are in danger,

27:54.454 --> 27:56.500
and you give it up
for the Yorkie?

27:56.586 --> 28:00.895
- You never understood me,
 Xander.
- Xander, who is this woman?

28:00.982 --> 28:03.463
Anya? She's, um,

28:03.550 --> 28:06.554
Anya, my ex.

28:06.641 --> 28:08.861
Oh.Hey!

28:08.948 --> 28:12.429
- Nobody's bragging here.
- Ah, ah, ah.

28:12.516 --> 28:16.390
Hey! Hands off
the merchandise, Spike.

28:16.477 --> 28:19.827
You don't get
to go there again.Please.

28:19.914 --> 28:21.787
I've already forgotten
about our little time together.

28:21.874 --> 28:24.049
I thought you were Xander's ex-girlfriend.

28:24.136 --> 28:26.574
- I am.
- But you and Spike--

28:26.661 --> 28:28.881
- Had a thing.
- Didn't last.

28:28.968 --> 28:32.013
- But weren't you Buffy--
- Briefly.
- Never serious.

28:32.101 --> 28:34.625
[ Sighs ]
Is there anyone here
that hasn't slept together?

28:34.712 --> 28:37.324
[ Anya ]
Look. At least
we're all bipeds,

28:37.411 --> 28:39.934
which is more than I can say
for Ronnie the worm boy.

28:40.021 --> 28:42.241
Okay, guys. Can we focus
here for just a second?

28:42.328 --> 28:46.028
Anya, this Ronnie?
He wasn't a worm.
Worms are, like, this big.

28:46.115 --> 28:49.249
- This thing was like--
- Sluggoth demon. Am I right?

28:50.423 --> 28:52.599
[ Sighs ]
Maybe.

28:52.686 --> 28:55.384
Wait.
I didn't wish for that.
I don't even know...

28:55.471 --> 28:57.518
what this whatchamacallit
demon thing is.

28:57.605 --> 29:00.913
Sluggoth demon.
It's a very large,
very nasty natural predator,

29:01.000 --> 29:03.045
who died around
the Crusades.

29:03.132 --> 29:06.005
Same phylum.
It's not cheating.
I just embellished.

29:06.092 --> 29:07.962
Well, you can
unembellish now.

29:09.703 --> 29:12.750
Bite me, Harris.
I have rules
to work with.

29:12.837 --> 29:15.275
Vengeance demon
codes of conduct.

29:15.362 --> 29:17.711
But you'll never
understand, 'cause
you're all still so...

human. [ Spike ] I'm not.

29:23.326 --> 29:27.374
Demon, just like
yourself, Anya.

29:27.461 --> 29:29.984
Now, you're gonna turn
the spell around,

29:30.071 --> 29:32.596
like a good little
vengeance demon,
or I-- What?

29:34.468 --> 29:36.383
Oh, my God.What are you staring at?

29:37.992 --> 29:41.083
Oh, my God.Right. Let's go.

29:41.170 --> 29:43.738
- How did you do it?
- Spike, what is
 she talking about?

29:43.825 --> 29:46.827
I can see you.Nothing. Let's go.
Got some worm hunting to do.

29:46.914 --> 29:48.176
How'd you do it?Shut up!

29:48.263 --> 29:50.396
- It shouldn't be possible!
- Shut your mouth!

29:50.483 --> 29:53.008
How did you get it?I said, you shut up!

29:57.621 --> 29:59.231
[ Crowd Chattering ] [ Woman ] Somebody help her!

30:09.676 --> 30:12.027
I am sogonna kick
your ass.

30:13.246 --> 30:15.203
Right, bitch.
Round and round--

30:15.290 --> 30:17.205
You haven't changed,
Spike.

30:22.429 --> 30:24.997
Workin' out some
personal issues, are we?

30:29.305 --> 30:32.481
Hey, I guess
this'll be first contact,
since you know when.

Ooh. Up for another
round on the balcony?

30:42.927 --> 30:48.585
Right you are, luv.
I haven't changed.
Not a lick!

30:48.672 --> 30:53.721
And watching your face
trying to figure me out
was absolutely delicious.

30:53.807 --> 30:57.159
- Buffy!
- Not now, Xander.

30:57.246 --> 31:00.075
Nancy. She's gone.
And out there all alone,
she's worm bait.

31:01.336 --> 31:03.862
[ Groans ]
I'll go find her.

31:03.949 --> 31:07.125
You stay with Anya.
Get her to reverse that spell.

31:07.212 --> 31:10.955
Hey, is that it? A little
touchy-feely, then you're
off to the batpoles?

31:14.001 --> 31:17.962
Freaks! Why do I surround
myself with freaks?

want me to do?

32:27.815 --> 32:30.209
Reverse the spell.It's not that easy,
Xander.

32:30.296 --> 32:32.863
You can do it.Yeah, sure.
The spell part.

32:32.951 --> 32:36.388
What about me?
I'm in enough trouble
as it is.

32:36.476 --> 32:40.914
Halfrek's all over my case.
D'Hoffryn is not pleased
with my work.

32:41.001 --> 32:43.917
You don't want
to see him angry.
Trust me.

32:44.005 --> 32:47.616
Nice friends you got.Nice friends I had.

32:47.703 --> 32:52.317
Chums, coworkers, bridesmaids--
I had the whole package
until something fell apart.

32:52.404 --> 32:56.234
What could that be, Xander?You're saying
this is my fault?

32:56.322 --> 33:00.760
All I'm saying is none
of this happened until youdumped me at the altar.

33:00.847 --> 33:04.547
And sooner or later, Anya,
that excuse just stops working.
