She has added a photo me and mom on "book".

00:27.174 --> 00:31.051
- Facebook, a social network.
- I am worried.

00:31.135 --> 00:34.180
It should not be.
All young people have it.

00:34.263 --> 00:38.770
It is a waste of time.
What in the world she writes?

00:38.853 --> 00:43.441
- She writes what suits her.
- Can anyone see it?

00:43.524 --> 00:46.735
All her friends.

00:47.736 --> 00:52.157
So I throw the computer out, so she'll stop.

01:26.441 --> 01:29.403
This is good.

01:47.587 --> 01:52.009
- It's too modern.
- You're so old-fashioned, Attilio.

01:52.092 --> 01:55.929
What did I say?
It's too modern for me.

01:58.348 --> 02:00.976
I think it's gonna end badly.

02:01.059 --> 02:04.353
Don Pietro could talk to Conte.

02:12.447 --> 02:15.199
Do not like it?

03:12.006 --> 03:16.094
<i>- Who is it?</i>
- It's me, Mom.

03:40.366 --> 03:42.871
Go.

03:47.334 --> 03:51.295
- Everything all right?
- Yeah, he's headed there.

04:35.672 --> 04:39.050
Salvato, do not smoke at the table.

04:39.133 --> 04:44.015
It is a false cigarette.
Can not you see the light?

04:44.099 --> 04:46.393
I try to keep up.

04:46.476 --> 04:50.479
It makes no difference that it is false.

04:50.563 --> 04:53.858
I do not want you smoke at the table.

05:00.239 --> 05:05.827
Lord, bless us and the daily
bread, our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

05:05.910 --> 05:08.037
Amen.

05:39.569 --> 05:44.659
Mom, you should be with a cooking program.

05:50.790 --> 05:53.292
Turn on.

06:06.429 --> 06:08.556
What is it?

06:10.975 --> 06:16.400
- What happened?
- Nothing. Relax. Wait.

06:16.483 --> 06:19.319
The pigs have set fire to the place.
Come here.

06:19.403 --> 06:23.739
- Salvatore...
- Calm down.

06:26.117 --> 06:28.160
Do not worry.

06:30.246 --> 06:32.790
- Do not worry.
- Where are we going?

06:34.125 --> 06:36.376
You mild.

06:39.879 --> 06:43.343
- We are dying now, Salvatore.
- Sit here.

06:47.848 --> 06:51.017
Full of grace, the Lord is with you.

06:51.100 --> 06:54.437
Blessed are you
among women and the fruit of your womb.

06:54.520 --> 06:58.190
Hello? I want to report a fire.

06:58.274 --> 07:01.777
It burns in with Stornaiolo 71

07:01.861 --> 07:05.780
No, I do not know.
You can see the fire from the street.

07:05.822 --> 07:11.244
No, I'm not.
I am a citizen. Anyone.

07:19.296 --> 07:23.341
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners,

07:23.424 --> 07:27.261
- Now and in our hour of death.

07:31.557 --> 07:34.936
It stinks of gasoline.
What's the deal?

07:35.019 --> 07:37.646
- The leaking well.
- Idiot.

07:37.729 --> 07:40.690
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

07:41.942 --> 07:47.282
You bet 1,000 on pupetta?
So we win 5,000.

07:49.368 --> 07:53.204
- Go to hell, Alfre.
- We can win 6,000, Atti.

07:53.287 --> 07:57.959
- 6,000.
- Shut up.

07:59.293 --> 08:03.714
Use them wisely.
I can not play my money up.

08:03.798 --> 08:08.593
- Then you need to keep them.
- Go to hell.

08:08.677 --> 08:12.764
My clothes stink. I'm going home
and change. Do you want to?

08:12.848 --> 08:14.852
Let's go.

08:14.935 --> 08:18.522
- See you.
- Hello.

10:28.359 --> 10:32.530
- Hello. Go ahead, come in..
- Thank you, Donna Imma.

10:34.783 --> 10:37.410
- Coffee?
- We will not interfere.

10:37.494 --> 10:40.412
- I do not interfere.
- Thank you.

10:40.496 --> 10:44.083
<i>- Carmela. Brew coffee.</i>
- Okay.

10:48.506 --> 10:52.134
What are you doing?

10:55.679 --> 10:58.181
Looking at her ass?

10:58.223 --> 11:01.059
- Not at all.
- Shame on you.

11:01.142 --> 11:07.774
Curcio writes 1.78
and De Rosa writes 1.2490.

11:09.108 --> 11:12.319
Don Pietro, is it safe?

11:12.403 --> 11:17.243
I do, but if Contes company is, we're done.

11:17.326 --> 11:22.331
I was out twice
and will not shafted by Conte again.

11:22.415 --> 11:23.873
I understand that.

11:23.957 --> 11:28.169
Firstly:
Speak well, there are ladies present.

11:28.253 --> 11:29.754
Sorry, Donna Imma.

11:29.838 --> 11:34.217
Second: Conte has grasped
he will not blunder.

11:34.301 --> 11:37.053
Can we be sure of that?

11:40.264 --> 11:44.518
Do as surveyor says then the contract home.

11:44.602 --> 11:46.689
Gennaro.

11:49.191 --> 11:53.821
Appendix 2 Russo, coefficient 14

11:53.863 --> 11:59.492
I would like to have been there
and see the bastard fucking pants.

11:59.576 --> 12:03.997
- He must remain in the skin.
- And fit Häschen.

12:04.080 --> 12:07.292
And if he does not get it?

12:14.215 --> 12:20.348
So we explain to him again that it is
Salvatore Conte's rules, not mine.

12:31.858 --> 12:35.362
- Donna Imma, excuse me.
- Ciro.

12:35.445 --> 12:39.199
I would hear Don Pietro if I can go.

12:39.282 --> 12:42.535
- It's all right. I say it.
- Good evening.

12:42.618 --> 12:46.831
Listen, Ciro.
Like this couch?

12:48.167 --> 12:51.546
Jeez. It is very nice.

12:51.629 --> 12:55.424
Then you get it off me.

12:55.507 --> 12:59.970
- Do you think about it?
- I can not accept it.

13:00.053 --> 13:05.016
You do me a favor.
I get a new bed in the morning.

13:05.100 --> 13:08.478
I ask Genny help you. Genny.

13:08.562 --> 13:11.647
<i>- What is it, Mom?</i>
- Come and Ciro.

13:14.442 --> 13:16.694
Here.

13:18.114 --> 13:21.117
- Thank you, Gennaro.
- You, Ciro?

13:23.745 --> 13:27.998
Call me next time grilling with Conte.

13:28.081 --> 13:33.003
Do not worry, you'll get the opportunity.
It's not over.

13:33.086 --> 13:37.257
Call me. Do you understand?

13:38.508 --> 13:40.635
Hey.

13:40.718 --> 13:43.304
- Thank you.
- Hello.

14:03.033 --> 14:06.954
Is it safe? I understand. Thank you.

14:07.037 --> 14:09.998
- Have Ciro taken couch?
- Yes, why?

14:10.082 --> 14:13.960
The new one is not good.

14:14.043 --> 14:18.005
It is not good. Not good.

14:18.089 --> 14:21.511
The family Capano has been
Sharm el-Sheikh.

14:21.594 --> 14:25.723
- Who wants to hear about Capano?
- Where are you grumpy.

14:25.807 --> 14:29.643
- I've been eating too many meatballs.
- He has only eaten fifteen.

14:29.726 --> 14:32.020
He probably tapeworms.

14:32.062 --> 14:37.359
- The kids would love Sharm el-Sheikh.
- They have fun anywhere.

14:37.442 --> 14:41.571
- But there's more fun there.
- You're so beautiful.

14:46.909 --> 14:49.998
It is late. Attilio!

14:51.833 --> 14:57.254
- Atti, we need to go.
- I can not take.

14:57.337 --> 15:00.883
I'll even go so.

15:00.966 --> 15:03.218
I'll call you.

15:03.302 --> 15:06.221
- Hey, Antonietta.
- Hello.

15:21.154 --> 15:23.531
- Hey, toupee.
- Ciro.

15:23.615 --> 15:25.742
Ciruzzo. A coffee?

15:25.784 --> 15:29.536
Ciro? Do I have with you?

15:29.620 --> 15:35.250
- Why do you think I'm here?
- Everything is planned in advance.

15:35.334 --> 15:41.382
- Can I ask you a favor?
- What is it toupee?

15:41.423 --> 15:45.593
My wife has a nephew He's good, but...

17:56.685 --> 18:02.023
Three dead. At least three dead.
And who are injured on the floor.

18:02.064 --> 18:05.151
The bastards also threw two bombs.

18:05.234 --> 18:10.865
- How are you?
- Never mind. You should have been dead.

18:10.948 --> 18:16.036
We fucked up, Atti. I knew
Conte would avenge the fire.

18:16.119 --> 18:20.582
Do not tell Pietro.
Do you understand that?

18:26.423 --> 18:30.384
It could have been any of us,
other than the immortal-

18:30.468 --> 18:33.804
- Him that no one can kill.

18:33.888 --> 18:39.769
Anyone of the Center. So would
we have arranged over one of ours.

18:40.770 --> 18:46.858
They shot at our house on a Sunday.
There could have been children.

18:47.859 --> 18:51.446
It is not something To remedy.

18:51.529 --> 18:54.326
We have to find him.

18:54.409 --> 18:59.122
And pulling his snake tongue.

18:59.206 --> 19:03.292
They say he's hiding in hats factory.

19:03.376 --> 19:06.796
No matter where he is, we'll find him.

19:06.879 --> 19:11.050
Yes, Don Piè, but we must start somewhere.

19:11.133 --> 19:14.303
We need to get him out.
It is not a place...

19:14.387 --> 19:18.306
- Not this place?
- We can not just walk into.

19:18.390 --> 19:22.143
- It's dangerous.
- I need to be more clear.

19:22.227 --> 19:26.775
We must think.
He guards everywhere.

19:26.859 --> 19:29.778
What are we thinking?

19:29.862 --> 19:34.699
If it was your son at the bar,
You should also think about first?

19:34.782 --> 19:37.785
And you should also think?

19:37.869 --> 19:40.913
- And you?
- Yes, but what do we do?

19:40.997 --> 19:43.624
Shut up.

19:45.542 --> 19:51.757
Conte should have thought of it before.
Now it's too late.

20:34.175 --> 20:38.262
How do we get in?
There are guards everywhere.

20:38.304 --> 20:43.267
It is his territory. What do you say?

20:43.351 --> 20:47.396
I do not know if we find Conte,
or if he finds us.

20:47.479 --> 20:51.942
- We have found him.
- I'm serious.

20:55.990 --> 21:00.911
Salvatore Conte does what he wants,
and Don Pietro obey him.

21:00.995 --> 21:06.583
He is not Pietro Savastano
for its blue eyes sake.

21:13.506 --> 21:16.342
You know what I think?

21:16.384 --> 21:22.055
Pietro Savastano has grown old,
and by Salvatore Conte.

21:27.980 --> 21:31.233
<i>Police technicians</i>
examine the blasting sites.

21:31.317 --> 21:36.529
Should we not buy that new couch
outside Naples? In Salerno.

21:36.613 --> 21:39.407
- What do you say?
- No.

21:39.490 --> 21:43.578
Should we buy the same
when we know that it is full of...

21:43.661 --> 21:46.748
We should not do anything.

21:49.791 --> 21:53.253
Should we hang warning signs up?

21:53.337 --> 21:59.303
I should have given them
an upside down and smashed shop.

21:59.345 --> 22:02.055
I think they knew something.

22:02.138 --> 22:05.350
- Speak well.
- Am I speaking Chinese?

22:05.433 --> 22:10.021
- We should not do anything.
- Shall we sit on the floor?

22:35.964 --> 22:39.217
Go ahead. Go to your father.

22:56.402 --> 23:00.239
- Clear path.
- Clear path.

23:01.949 --> 23:04.242
There are clear.

23:56.379 --> 23:59.048
- Hello.
- Hello.

24:15.021 --> 24:18.275
Hurry up.

24:18.358 --> 24:21.443
- Do you remember it?
- Yes.

24:24.572 --> 24:28.202
They have started a new organization.
Do you know?

24:28.286 --> 24:33.374
There are guards and journalists.
They have sold 300 fewer doses.

24:33.458 --> 24:36.960
- Did you talk to Pietro?
- They are waiting for us.

24:54.477 --> 24:57.231
There's nothing to do.

24:59.358 --> 25:04.488
I've tried, but he does not listen.
It must be done now.

25:04.571 --> 25:07.908
We are making his life a living hell.
As he did with us.

25:07.991 --> 25:12.913
Good. So we get the police
and the press after us again.

25:12.996 --> 25:15.040
Where is he hiding?

25:15.123 --> 25:18.752
He is there, where Häschen saved tomorrow.

25:18.835 --> 25:22.963
- Says who?
- I do not know. He just know.

25:23.047 --> 25:25.132
He's crazy.

25:25.216 --> 25:29.347
He says Conte spreading rumors
that Savastano is at risk.

25:29.430 --> 25:32.266
- That's what I said.
- Stop.

25:32.350 --> 25:37.104
We must do what is necessary.
Man for himself.

25:37.145 --> 25:39.898
Now we go.

25:51.284 --> 25:55.371
When you stop to slander Pietro?

25:55.454 --> 26:01.921
If they gossip,
you get a bullet in your head.

26:02.005 --> 26:07.009
Imagine if it was me, that would shoot you?

26:16.977 --> 26:21.439
Pino, I have no money.
Can I borrow some of yours?

26:21.522 --> 26:26.485
- Forget it.
- Come on. You get them during the week.

26:26.569 --> 26:30.658
What is it?
Are your feet are made of confections?

26:31.993 --> 26:37.581
Can I ask you something?
Is that marzipan confections?

26:39.791 --> 26:45.756
Because I have weird shoes on?
Idiots.

26:45.839 --> 26:49.176
I ask Genny about money.

26:49.259 --> 26:53.387
- What are you? He's on another line now.
- What is he doing?

26:54.680 --> 26:58.603
Please come here, confections.
Give a hand to the confection.

26:59.604 --> 27:03.358
Did you know that the
have lowered prices in Sanità?

27:03.441 --> 27:06.693
Now it costs heroin Eleven.

27:07.694 --> 27:11.949
They say this is due to a new organization.

27:13.951 --> 27:17.371
But I do not think.

27:17.454 --> 27:21.916
- Why so?
- The disposes of it.

27:21.999 --> 27:25.628
They know that soon hernia.
So there will be guards-

27:25.712 --> 27:30.301
- And with guards nearby,
you can not sell anything.

27:34.389 --> 27:37.474
Is it tomorrow?

27:41.478 --> 27:44.565
- I will.
- It does not, Gennaro.

27:44.648 --> 27:48.360
- Determines you over me?
- No.

27:48.444 --> 27:51.529
It is your father who decide.

27:55.742 --> 28:00.790
I want to show Dad, I can handle it.

28:00.874 --> 28:05.712
- If you are with, I can do it.
- I know you can.

28:05.795 --> 28:09.173
But it's still dangerous.

28:11.800 --> 28:15.262
Want to make your father happy?

28:15.304 --> 28:18.682
So stay home.

28:27.941 --> 28:30.111
Are you scared?

28:32.405 --> 28:35.784
Do you think it's strange?

28:38.077 --> 28:43.666
If Dad lets me take, so I protect you.

28:47.545 --> 28:49.797
That's right.

30:00.744 --> 30:04.581
Make a to receipt to Attilio Diotallevi.

30:07.000 --> 30:10.878
- Is that a problem?
- No.

30:10.961 --> 30:14.799
- Should he also have three stores?
- Yes.

30:17.009 --> 30:21.973
A receipt for Attilio
and two to Centocapelli and A 'Lisca.

30:29.896 --> 30:33.694
- Hit it.
- Here.

31:04.683 --> 31:07.311
- Hello.
- Hello.

31:12.607 --> 31:16.277
- When will you?
- Soon.

31:24.367 --> 31:27.537
Close the door slightly.

32:00.862 --> 32:03.992
- Where's the coffee?
- On the other hand.

32:16.713 --> 32:19.841
Where are you stupid.

32:28.557 --> 32:32.394
Father?
Can I take with Ciro tonight?

32:35.774 --> 32:39.528
- Dad?
- I heard you. The answer is no.

32:39.611 --> 32:43.740
- I'll stick with him.
- There is no reason for it.

32:43.823 --> 32:47.952
Go out and have fun.
Your time will come.

32:49.871 --> 32:52.832
You make me never have a chance.

32:52.915 --> 32:57.961
Gennaro, you are my son.
You need no chances.

33:32.120 --> 33:37.753
- Look straight ahead.
- I will die with combed hair.

33:37.836 --> 33:42.048
We buy his jacket
in children's clothing store next time.

33:42.131 --> 33:45.301
- Did you hear?
- Go to hell.

34:32.889 --> 34:36.228
- You all right, Michele?
- Fine, and you?

34:36.312 --> 34:39.065
It's going well. Hey.

34:40.900 --> 34:43.693
Lucia. She is an expert in billiards.

34:43.777 --> 34:49.032
- I do not shake your hand.
- She does not vibrate. Get it?

34:49.114 --> 34:53.244
Do you ever laugh a little?
You are always so angry.

34:53.328 --> 34:57.247
You are right. I'm mad.

35:10.096 --> 35:13.056
- What are you doing?
- Would you like something to drink?

35:13.139 --> 35:16.101
- She's with me.
- Your name would Noemi?

35:16.184 --> 35:19.312
Fatter not you? Are you stupid or what?

35:20.313 --> 35:23.775
- What did you say?
- Gennaro, stop.

35:23.858 --> 35:28.445
- I'll kill you.
- We are in their territory.

35:29.530 --> 35:32.157
Hello, Noemi.

36:05.107 --> 36:09.030
Put it on, immortal,
then you can be more calm.

36:25.420 --> 36:29.006
It's going to go to hell.

37:47.753 --> 37:49.421
Pis.

41:13.293 --> 41:15.629
Attilio!

41:18.631 --> 41:21.634
Attilio. Attilio.

41:36.272 --> 41:39.653
- It hurts.
- It'll be fine.

41:41.446 --> 41:44.783
- It'll be fine.
- It hurts.

41:48.744 --> 41:51.455
Atti.

41:56.127 --> 41:58.587
Atti.

42:12.686 --> 42:16.940
We must get away. The police come.
We go. He's dead.

42:17.024 --> 42:21.569
We can not do anything.
Would you be caught? Come on.

44:23.900 --> 44:29.405
What happens to you?
Why are you acting like this?

44:29.489 --> 44:34.451
I thought that it was better
to tell everything at once.

44:36.745 --> 44:39.331
Tell.

44:41.877 --> 44:46.757
Attilio's death. Centocapelli with.
And A 'and Lisca Africano.

44:46.840 --> 44:49.301
And skimmings?

44:49.384 --> 44:52.220
He fled when he was there.

44:52.303 --> 44:55.264
He was there. He was there.

44:55.306 --> 44:59.435
But all your men are dead.
There's no one left.

45:06.400 --> 45:09.278
It was probably for the best.

45:09.361 --> 45:12.616
It comes Conte to remember.

45:12.700 --> 45:16.537
Now he thinks about, before he slips up.

45:28.548 --> 45:31.718
I'm sorry, happened to Attilio.

45:31.801 --> 45:36.221
I know that he was like a father to you.

45:36.305 --> 45:39.808
You know also, That we may do it?

45:39.892 --> 45:42.855
And it must be like this?

45:47.526 --> 45:51.196
I make a funeral wreath for all.

45:51.279 --> 45:54.782
I'll take care of women and wives.

45:54.866 --> 46:01.498
I'll fix it. They get money every
month also their girlfriends.

46:03.124 --> 46:06.460
Bravo, immortal.

46:06.543 --> 46:09.505
You also get some money.

46:45.167 --> 46:48.796

47:13.485 --> 47:17.450
- Luana! Take that.

47:17.533 --> 47:20.911
One day it goes to pieces.

47:20.995 --> 47:24.164

47:34.799 --> 47:36.842
Hello?

47:36.926 --> 47:40.888
<i>Was</i> bloody bodies at the scene.

47:40.971 --> 47:45.436
- What do you think?
- Good choice.

47:45.519 --> 47:48.814
It was not very expensive.

47:52.067 --> 47:54.861
Is it fine that way?

47:56.905 --> 48:00.825
- Thank you. Goodbye. See you, signora.
- See you.

48:12.419 --> 48:15.842
Should we try the wonder?

48:18.469 --> 48:21.347
Yes, let's try it.

48:32.566 --> 48:37.195
- Is not that a little harsh?
- It's a little stiff, yes.

48:41.157 --> 48:46.456
Also backrest.
Is it so, or is it faulty?

48:46.539 --> 48:49.375
It must be so.

48:50.585 --> 48:55.672
I do not like it.
We need to exchange it.

48:57.424 --> 49:00.844
I should sit comfortably.

49:03.263 --> 49:06.600
We need to exchange it.

49:25.494 --> 49:31.375
Møgbetjente. You can stop
their microphones diagonally.

50:13.082 --> 50:15.751
Hello, Atti.

50:56.043 --> 50:58.212
- Come on.
- It's too late.

50:58.295 --> 51:01.548
- It is not.
