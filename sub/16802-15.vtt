 I was the first one to win
a buckle in the amateurs.

00:06.715 --> 00:09.300
And now I'm the first one to
have a big news story on me.

00:09.426 --> 00:11.803
What have you done first?

00:11.928 --> 00:12.721
Well, what?

00:19.269 --> 00:20.854
 I hear you missed
barrel racing.

00:20.979 --> 00:22.105
 It's nothing.

00:22.230 --> 00:23.565
 I promise I won't
stand in your way.

00:23.690 --> 00:24.315
 I can't believe this.

Do you trust me at all?

 It's not you, it's Clay.

I don't trust him.

 That's it?

 You're the one who
broke up with me, right?

00:33.658 --> 00:36.202
 I can't stop
feeling like this.

00:36.327 --> 00:37.495
I'm the one who
broke up with Adam,

00:37.620 --> 00:39.497

it's a long weekend.

02:58.011 --> 02:58.887
 No, forget it.

 You can't have it off.

 But--

03:01.848 --> 03:03.350
 No, no buts.

03:03.475 --> 03:04.684
You're not leaving
me high and dry

03:04.809 --> 03:06.895
so you can go running
around with Clay.

03:07.020 --> 03:07.979
 Running around?

03:08.104 --> 03:08.855
What's that supposed to mean?

03:08.980 --> 03:09.981
 I don't know.

03:10.106 --> 03:12.567
I don't want to know.

 Well, not that it's
any of your business,

to do with Clay.

There you go.

 Thank you.

 My dad invited me on a
fishing trip back east.

03:28.875 --> 03:30.627
 Oh, you fish?

 Well, no, not really, but
school's starting up again

03:33.505 --> 03:34.673
and this is probably
the last time I'm going

03:34.798 --> 03:36.007
to get to see him for a while.

03:36.132 --> 03:37.467
 Fine.

03:37.592 --> 03:39.094
Just give me a little
more notice next time,

03:39.219 --> 03:40.762
will you, please?

03:40.887 --> 03:41.763

 Hey, Georgie.

03:51.064 --> 03:52.941
This is my cousin Wyatt.

 Howdy.

 Seriously, dude?

03:55.485 --> 03:56.486
Nobody says that.

03:56.611 --> 03:57.237
 OK.

03:57.362 --> 03:58.655
 He's from the city.

03:58.780 --> 04:00.323
 Yeah, but that doesn't
mean I don't love

04:00.448 --> 04:02.534

hanging around

04:02.659 --> 04:03.868
with the big man in town.

04:03.993 --> 04:05.829
 I'm sure he's got

 Oh, yeah, with all
the, uh, buckles.

 Can you blame him?

 He's all something.

All that tack needs
a good cleaning.

I've been totally
putting it off.

polish, I don't think

05:02.552 --> 05:03.762
I could take that right now.

05:03.887 --> 05:05.930
 Maybe it's a project
for Georgie, then.

05:06.056 --> 05:08.266
 It's just not fair to make
her do it all by herself.

05:08.391 --> 05:09.768
 I could get Jade to help.

05:09.893 --> 05:12.020
I bet she wouldn't mind
making a few extra bucks.

05:12.145 --> 05:13.438
 Actually, that's a great idea.

05:13.563 --> 05:14.814

take much convincing.

14:37.127 --> 14:38.503
So the fishing trip's off.

14:38.628 --> 14:39.421
 Really?

14:39.546 --> 14:41.631
I'm sorry to hear that.

14:41.756 --> 14:46.052
Well, at least I don't
have to find a fill in.

14:46.177 --> 14:48.763
 Yeah, but here's the thing.

14:48.888 --> 14:51.433
This is gonna be my last
weekend at the diner.

14:51.558 --> 14:53.852
 I don't-- I don't
unders-- you're quitting?

14:53.977 --> 14:56.521
 Well, yeah, for now.

14:56.646 --> 14:58.523
I'm going down to the
southern circuit with Clay.

14:58.648 --> 15:00.233
 Jade, you're not
ready for that.

15:00.358 --> 15:01.901
Clay's not ready
for that either.

15:02.027 --> 15:03.486
 What about school?

15:03.611 --> 15:05.405
 Yeah, we gotta get you
ready for the spring sessions

15:05.530 --> 15:06.948
where you actually
have a chance.

15:07.073 --> 15:09.451
 Dad, I'm talking
about university.

15:09.576 --> 15:11.119
 Right, what about that?

15:11.244 --> 15:12.537
 I'll take a couple
semesters off.

15:12.662 --> 15:13.955
It's not going to kill me.

15:14.080 --> 15:16.624
 Your parents know about this?

15:16.750 --> 15:18.126
 It's been a long day.

15:18.251 --> 15:20.045
I'm gonna go home now.

15:20.170 --> 15:21.504
 All right.

15:21.629 --> 15:23.882
 I'll talk to her.

15:24.007 --> 15:25.258
Jade.

15:25.383 --> 15:28.428
Hey, he's just
looking out for you.

15:28.553 --> 15:32.974
You know, maybe you
should think about this.

15:33.099 --> 15:35.352
 It's-- it's only for a year.

15:35.477 --> 15:37.562
And you know, some
people turned out

15:37.687 --> 15:39.022
really well even
though they didn't

15:39.147 --> 15:40.398
actually go to university.

15:40.523 --> 15:43.443
 All right, having a
degree isn't everything.

15:43.568 --> 15:46.154
But if we are being honest
here, there are times

15:46.279 --> 15:48.823
when I regret not having one.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.533
 Well, you can always go back.

15:50.658 --> 15:54.496
 No, it's not that easy,
especially now that Ty

15:54.621 --> 15:56.331
and I are having a baby.

15:56.456 --> 15:57.624
Life happens.

15:57.749 --> 15:59.292
And once you get off
that education track,

15:59.417 --> 16:02.003
it's really hard to get back on.

16:02.128 --> 16:03.171
Just something to think about.

16:16.267 --> 16:17.268
 Good morning.

16:17.394 --> 16:18.186
 Morning.

16:18.311 --> 16:19.729
 You OK?

16:19.854 --> 16:22.691
 No, my hands are pretty
sore from all this polishing.

16:22.816 --> 16:25.527
I'm not even halfway done yet.

16:25.652 --> 16:26.820
Oh, boy.

16:26.945 --> 16:28.029
 What the--

16:33.118 --> 16:33.868
 You bought it?

16:33.993 --> 16:35.203
 No, not yet.

16:38.540 --> 16:40.917
So you want to go
for a test drive?

16:41.042 --> 16:41.835
 With the top down?

16:41.960 --> 16:42.961
It's freezing.

16:43.086 --> 16:44.212
 I mean, it's a convertible.

16:44.337 --> 16:46.172
I gotta feel the
wind in my hair.

16:46.297 --> 16:47.966
 You're gonna get frostbite.

16:48.091 --> 16:51.928
 No, see, I came prepared.

16:52.053 --> 16:55.890
I brought things.

16:56.016 --> 16:58.059
 This is Wyatt, Clay's cousin.

16:58.184 --> 17:00.854
 Oh, I guess confidence
runs in the family.

17:00.979 --> 17:03.189
I'm Amy.

17:03.314 --> 17:05.150
 I'm sorry, I can't.

17:05.275 --> 17:08.236
I have to finish cleaning tack.

17:08.361 --> 17:09.654
 Wow.

17:09.779 --> 17:13.825
As far as lame excuses
go, that was really lame.

17:13.950 --> 17:16.202
That was bad.

17:16.327 --> 17:17.704
Can you help me for
one second, please.

17:17.829 --> 17:19.914
Can you please tell her
that it's not often you get

17:20.040 --> 17:21.583
to test drive a car like this.

17:21.708 --> 17:23.292
 I just met you
and I'm supposed

17:23.417 --> 17:25.252
to be OK with Georgie
taking off just

17:25.377 --> 17:27.881
because you're related to Clay?

17:28.006 --> 17:30.842
 No, because I'm
related to Casey.

17:30.967 --> 17:34.763
But also because I promise to
get her back safe and sound.

17:34.888 --> 17:39.434
I'm just talking about a
very short, safe test drive.

17:43.063 --> 17:47.525
 He does have a point, the tack
will be here when you get back.

17:47.650 --> 17:50.153
 OK, a short ride.

17:50.278 --> 17:51.905
 Fine.
Short.

17:52.030 --> 17:52.864
 Thank you.

17:52.989 --> 17:54.115
 You're welcome.

17:54.240 --> 17:55.283
 Have fun.

18:01.206 --> 18:02.290
 Thank you.

18:06.586 --> 18:09.422
Hey, we're off.

18:09.547 --> 18:10.423
 Where are you going?

18:10.548 --> 18:12.717
 I'll be back in a bit.

18:12.842 --> 18:14.052
 What's that all about?

18:14.177 --> 18:16.096
 That was Clay's--

18:16.221 --> 18:18.598
Casey's nephew.

18:18.723 --> 18:21.434
And they're just going
for a short ride.

18:21.559 --> 18:23.311
I figure that she could
probably use the distraction.

18:23.436 --> 18:25.730
She's been a little off lately.

18:25.855 --> 18:26.731
 Yeah.

18:26.856 --> 18:28.149
Adam, right?

18:28.274 --> 18:29.776
 Yeah, I think she
really misses him.

18:32.821 --> 18:37.117
Grandpa, look, do
you remember Ghost?

18:37.242 --> 18:39.953
 I'll be, it is Ghost.

18:40.078 --> 18:41.037
 Look at his chest.

18:41.162 --> 18:42.664
He's hurt.

18:42.789 --> 18:43.623
I saw him this morning.

18:43.748 --> 18:45.583
He looked fine.

18:45.709 --> 18:46.835
He's bleeding pretty badly.

18:46.960 --> 18:48.336
We should call
Cassandra at the clinic.

18:48.461 --> 18:49.337
 Yeah.

18:52.465 --> 18:54.467
 I can't believe
that nephew of yours

18:54.592 --> 18:56.594
filling Jade's head
with all that crap.

18:56.720 --> 18:58.471
 Is she really
gonna go with him?

18:58.596 --> 19:00.432
 That's what she says.

19:00.557 --> 19:02.100
Oh, man, I'm telling you.

19:02.225 --> 19:04.019
 Look, you can't blame
Clay for all the decisions

19:04.144 --> 19:05.437
that she makes.

19:05.562 --> 19:07.814
 Yeah, well, he's
not a great influence.

19:07.939 --> 19:09.441
Just look at what's happened
since the two of them

19:09.566 --> 19:11.026
started hanging out.

19:11.151 --> 19:13.403
He got her so drunk, she
missed her first pro rodeo.

19:13.528 --> 19:14.696
 That's not fair.

19:14.821 --> 19:16.156
She was making
questionable decisions

19:16.281 --> 19:17.407
long before he ever
moved to Hudson,

19:17.532 --> 19:18.783
and you know that
better than anyone.

19:18.908 --> 19:21.661
 Yeah, well, he's no help.

19:21.786 --> 19:24.497
 Look, I know how
protective you are over Jade.

19:24.622 --> 19:27.292
And I love that, but I'm
not just gonna stand here

19:27.417 --> 19:28.793
and let you run down my nephew.

19:28.918 --> 19:30.378
It's like you've had it
in for him since day one.

19:30.503 --> 19:32.589
 Yeah, day one, the
day he walked in here

19:32.714 --> 19:33.882
and punched one of
my rodeo students.

19:36.676 --> 19:39.054
 Well, anyway, I don't
think going south to compete

19:39.179 --> 19:41.890
is the worst idea in the world.

19:42.015 --> 19:44.642
In fact, I've been
considering running

19:44.768 --> 19:46.811
the rails down there myself.

19:46.936 --> 19:49.356
 What?

19:49.481 --> 19:50.857
 Well, I'd be able
to keep my eye on him.

19:50.982 --> 19:53.443
And I'd be getting back
to something that I love.

19:53.568 --> 19:54.986
And winter's the
only time I don't

19:55.111 --> 19:56.363
have my own rodeos going on.

19:56.488 --> 20:00.033
 Seriously, you're gonna go?

20:00.158 --> 20:02.327
 I don't know.

20:02.452 --> 20:03.411
What do you think?

20:12.629 --> 20:14.339
 Why are we stopping?

20:14.464 --> 20:18.426
 I just wanted to
check out this cafe.

20:18.551 --> 20:19.928
 But I need to get back.

20:20.053 --> 20:21.763
You promised it would
be a short ride.

20:21.888 --> 20:25.308
 Yeah, but you need
to warm up first.

20:25.433 --> 20:27.727
Hot cocoas on me.

20:27.852 --> 20:29.229
OK.

20:29.354 --> 20:32.607
 OK, or you could just do
the top up on the stupid car.

20:32.732 --> 20:33.316
 What?

20:33.441 --> 20:34.401
 Nothing.

20:34.526 --> 20:35.443
 OK.

20:40.865 --> 20:42.117
 Welcome to my cafe.

20:42.242 --> 20:43.535
I'm Ian.

20:43.660 --> 20:46.413
Can I grab you a coffee
or perhaps a vase?

20:46.538 --> 20:48.665
I made them myself.

20:48.790 --> 20:49.874
 No.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.669
Thank you, but no.

20:52.794 --> 20:55.296
But jeez, I love the
kitschiness of this place.

20:55.422 --> 20:56.881
This is great.

20:57.007 --> 20:58.258
 Uh, thanks.

20:58.383 --> 21:00.593
 You've got a great
sense of humor, man.

21:00.719 --> 21:02.262
 OK.

21:02.387 --> 21:04.848
 Oh my God, that's--

21:04.973 --> 21:05.765
that's phenomenal.

21:05.890 --> 21:06.808
 What is it?

21:06.933 --> 21:11.312
 It is an old-timey
photo parlor.

21:11.438 --> 21:13.189
And they have costumes.

21:13.314 --> 21:16.484
[MUSIC - ROBYN DELL'UNTO, "CALL
 ME"]

21:16.609 --> 21:17.944
ROBYN DELL'UNTO: (SINGING) Wait.

21:18.069 --> 21:19.320
Did you wait

21:19.446 --> 21:20.905
 I feel good.

21:21.031 --> 21:21.740
ROBYN DELL'UNTO: (SINGING)
Before you walked away.

21:21.865 --> 21:22.782
 I'm feeling good.

21:22.907 --> 21:24.451
Come on, let's get
into character.

21:24.576 --> 21:25.326
ROBYN DELL'UNTO: (SINGING)
No, I don't mean to pick

21:25.452 --> 21:28.079
up old things and get low.

21:28.204 --> 21:33.001
But I can't let go,
can't let go, let it go.

21:33.126 --> 21:35.337
I still go tearing up the block.

21:35.462 --> 21:37.172
And I really wanna talk.

21:37.297 --> 21:38.214
Would you call me?

21:38.340 --> 21:39.132
A trip down the old street.

21:39.257 --> 21:40.258
Yeah.

21:40.383 --> 21:41.676
Lights out, you feel it beating.

21:41.801 --> 21:42.510
Oh-oh.

21:42.635 --> 21:44.095
Lines on the concrete.

21:44.220 --> 21:45.430
They're playing our song.

21:45.555 --> 21:46.431
Would you call me?

21:46.556 --> 21:48.016
Tear up the old street.

21:48.141 --> 21:49.893
I wanna tell you I was wrong.

21:50.018 --> 21:51.436
 Oh, yeah.

21:57.233 --> 21:58.276
 Oh, it's just you.

21:58.401 --> 21:59.694
 Just me?

21:59.819 --> 22:03.031
 Well, no offense, but
Georgie's gone AWOL.

22:03.156 --> 22:05.575
And so I've been left to clean
all of this stuff by myself.

22:05.700 --> 22:08.161
 I hope you didn't call
me over just to help.

22:08.286 --> 22:10.914
 No, I want to talk.

22:11.039 --> 22:13.208
 It's never a good thing
when a girl says that.

22:13.333 --> 22:14.334
 No, actually, it is.

22:14.459 --> 22:16.670
Because I've been thinking.

22:16.795 --> 22:18.338
 OK, now, I'm really scared.

22:18.463 --> 22:21.341
 OK, can you just shut up
for a second and let me talk.

22:21.466 --> 22:24.886
I think it's great that you
want to do the southern circuit.

22:25.011 --> 22:28.014
It would be a really
great adventure for us.

22:28.139 --> 22:28.973
 Us?

22:29.099 --> 22:30.183
You mean--

22:30.308 --> 22:31.935
 I've always
wanted to see Texas

22:32.060 --> 22:35.897
and New Mexico and Albuquerque
and compete with the big boys.

22:36.022 --> 22:38.400
And it would be
great for us to get

22:38.525 --> 22:39.317
to know each other like that.

22:39.442 --> 22:40.735
 Yeah.

22:40.860 --> 22:44.280
 The problem is I just
started second year.

22:44.406 --> 22:46.074
And I don't know, I just--

22:46.199 --> 22:48.451
I don't want to lose
that momentum, you know.

22:48.576 --> 22:49.869
 Look, Jade.

22:49.994 --> 22:54.165
 So I can't go,
just not right now.

22:54.290 --> 22:55.417
 Oh.

22:55.542 --> 22:58.712
Oh, geez, that's too bad.

23:02.465 --> 23:03.675
 You didn't want
me to go, did you?

23:03.800 --> 23:05.468
 I wouldn't put it that way.

23:05.593 --> 23:09.681
The truth is, it
never occurred to me.

23:09.806 --> 23:11.558
 We just started dating.

23:11.683 --> 23:14.269
How did you think that was gonna
work out if you just took off?

23:14.394 --> 23:16.187
 Well, I'll be
back in the spring.

23:16.312 --> 23:17.647
You'll still be here.

23:17.772 --> 23:19.107
We can pick up
where we left off.

23:24.696 --> 23:27.115
 You want me to
handle that rifle?

23:27.240 --> 23:28.908
 Why?

23:29.034 --> 23:31.870
You think this is the first
time I've shot one of these?

23:31.995 --> 23:35.123
 Hey, here he is.

23:35.248 --> 23:38.752
 You can't tranq him from here.

23:38.877 --> 23:42.380
I meant on account
of these trees.

23:42.505 --> 23:44.132
 How about you guys wait here.

23:44.257 --> 23:46.926
I'll go on my own and see if I
can bring him back towards us.

23:47.052 --> 23:48.762
 Or he'll get
completely out of range.

23:48.887 --> 23:50.472
 Oh, let's give her a chance.

24:02.233 --> 24:04.861
 Ghost, hey.

24:04.986 --> 24:06.821
Hey.

24:06.946 --> 24:09.657
You remember me?

24:09.783 --> 24:12.452
I'm not gonna hurt you.

24:12.577 --> 24:14.954
I want to help you.

24:15.080 --> 24:17.040
It's OK.

24:17.165 --> 24:20.335
Come here.

24:20.460 --> 24:21.586
Come on.

24:32.305 --> 24:34.182
That's it.

24:34.307 --> 24:35.975
Come on, good boy.

24:39.688 --> 24:42.190
That's it.

24:42.315 --> 24:43.191
I'm not gonna hurt you.

24:49.906 --> 24:50.532
Easy.

24:50.657 --> 24:52.158
Hey, hey, easy.

25:06.089 --> 25:07.048
[gunshot]

25:09.092 --> 25:12.804
Ghost, come back.

25:12.929 --> 25:13.555
 It's OK.

25:13.680 --> 25:14.723
He won't get far.

25:21.479 --> 25:24.441
 Are you OK?

25:24.566 --> 25:27.527
 I think he remembers me.

25:27.652 --> 25:30.113
Are you gonna be
able to help him?

25:30.238 --> 25:33.283
 You know what it's like when a
horse gets cut up on his chest.

25:33.408 --> 25:36.661
There's a lot of blood, but it
usually looks worse than it is.

25:36.786 --> 25:39.080
Probably got caught
up in barbed wire.

25:39.205 --> 25:42.542
He gashed himself
pretty badly, but it

25:42.667 --> 25:44.753
won't be too hard to suture.

25:44.878 --> 25:46.504
We'll give him some
antibiotics, and he should

25:46.629 --> 25:48.548
be fine once I'm through.

25:48.673 --> 25:49.591
 You hear that, boy?

25:49.716 --> 25:50.925
You're gonna be just fine.

26:01.978 --> 26:04.356
 I am in no mood for this.

26:04.481 --> 26:06.941
 Well, somebody has to
talk some sense into you.

26:07.067 --> 26:08.610
 I'm not going on the circuit.

26:08.735 --> 26:10.779
So you can spare
me the lecture, OK?

26:10.904 --> 26:12.405
 Really?

26:12.530 --> 26:15.367
 Yep, it turns out it was
never an option to begin with.

26:15.492 --> 26:16.409
 Well, that's great.

26:16.534 --> 26:18.161
 Clay didn't want me to go.

26:18.286 --> 26:21.748
 Well, I think you're
making the right choice.

26:21.873 --> 26:23.124
So is Clay still going?

26:23.249 --> 26:25.377
 He hasn't even given
it a second thought.

26:25.502 --> 26:28.672
He's just gonna go running
around doing who knows what.

26:28.797 --> 26:29.881
And I'm supposed
to just sit here

26:30.006 --> 26:31.549
and wait for him to come back.

26:31.675 --> 26:32.967
 Well, I'm sorry.

26:33.093 --> 26:34.052
 No, you're not.

26:34.177 --> 26:35.887
This is exactly what you wanted.

26:38.431 --> 26:42.352
You know, I actually thought
he wanted to be with me.

26:42.477 --> 26:44.562
But he's just like
everyone else in my life,

26:44.688 --> 26:47.565
moving as far away
from me as possible.

26:47.691 --> 26:51.319
So please, can you
just leave me alone?

26:59.202 --> 27:00.328
 See?

27:00.453 --> 27:02.163
 See what?

27:02.288 --> 27:05.041
 More fun than
cleaning tack, right?

27:05.166 --> 27:06.584
 It's not setting
the bar very high.

27:06.710 --> 27:07.794
 Come on.

27:07.919 --> 27:11.548
Just admit it,
you're having fun.

27:11.673 --> 27:15.176
Well, I know I'm having fun.

27:15.301 --> 27:16.136
I think you're great.

27:19.681 --> 27:23.018
 Well, you're OK, I guess.

27:23.143 --> 27:24.436
 Wow.

27:24.561 --> 27:26.146
You really know how
to pump a guy's tires.

27:35.989 --> 27:38.867
 Um, I--

27:38.992 --> 27:40.952
I can't.

27:41.077 --> 27:43.038
I'm sorry.

27:43.163 --> 27:44.873
 For what?

27:44.998 --> 27:46.458
 I really should get
back to Heartland.

27:46.583 --> 27:48.168
 Hey, hey.

27:48.293 --> 27:50.295
It's OK.

27:50.420 --> 27:51.212
I get it.

27:51.338 --> 27:52.339
It's fine.

27:52.464 --> 27:54.716
I mean, most girls
around here would rather

27:54.841 --> 27:58.845
be with a square-jawed,
restless, steer-to the-ground

27:58.970 --> 28:01.556
type of guy like my cousin.

28:01.681 --> 28:02.766
 No, no.

28:02.891 --> 28:03.725
That's not--

28:03.850 --> 28:05.310
 Hey, I said it's fine.

28:05.435 --> 28:06.227
I'll take you home.

28:18.073 --> 28:19.783
 I didn't mean to
hurt your feelings.

28:19.908 --> 28:21.409
I really did have
a great time today.

28:21.534 --> 28:24.704
It's not often I just get to
go with the flow and have fun.

28:24.829 --> 28:27.582
 Ah, sorry that I ruined it.

28:27.707 --> 28:29.000
 No, you didn't.

28:29.125 --> 28:32.671
The kiss was
actually pretty wow.

28:32.796 --> 28:34.547
 Really?

28:34.673 --> 28:40.303
Then why did you
kind of freak out?

28:40.428 --> 28:43.848
 I don't know,
it felt weird to--

28:43.973 --> 28:45.350
like, I just--

28:45.475 --> 28:46.851
I just broke up
with my boyfriend.

28:46.976 --> 28:49.396
And no, not the rugged
square-jawed type.

28:49.521 --> 28:54.984
What Adam is-- or what he
was was my best friend.

28:55.110 --> 28:57.821
In this world of
macho cowboy wannabes,

28:57.946 --> 29:00.824
he actually stands out
just as much as you do.

29:00.949 --> 29:03.118
 Sounds like an
interesting dude.

29:03.243 --> 29:04.244
 Yeah.

29:04.369 --> 29:06.746
And smart, like
ridiculously smart.

29:06.871 --> 29:08.790
And he makes me
laugh, he totally

29:08.915 --> 29:11.126
understands me, loves animals.

29:11.251 --> 29:13.795
He drives me crazy the way he
obsesses over how everything

29:13.920 --> 29:16.673
has to be a certain way.

29:16.798 --> 29:19.759
I'm even missing
that stuff right now.

29:19.884 --> 29:22.637
I'm sorry, you don't need
to hear about any of this.

29:22.762 --> 29:25.098
 No, please continue.

29:25.223 --> 29:27.434
I love listening to a cute
girl rattle on about how

29:27.559 --> 29:29.477
much she likes another guy.

29:29.602 --> 29:31.896
 Can you please put the top up?

29:32.022 --> 29:34.774
 Uh, no, we can't.

29:34.899 --> 29:37.569
 It's freezing, joke's over.

29:37.694 --> 29:38.528
 It's OK.

29:38.653 --> 29:40.363
It's broken.

29:40.488 --> 29:44.200
I wanted to take you out so bad
that I drove it over anyways.

29:44.325 --> 29:49.539
Truth is I haven't been having
a whole lot of luck with girls

29:49.664 --> 29:56.629
back home, which is why I
need a cool car like this.

29:56.755 --> 29:57.672
 I'm sorry.

29:57.797 --> 30:00.508
 No, please, no pity.

30:00.633 --> 30:04.637
Plus I think my luck's changing.

30:04.763 --> 30:08.516
I just found out that my
kisses are pretty wow.

30:12.771 --> 30:13.605
OK.

30:13.730 --> 30:14.856
 [laughs]

30:18.610 --> 30:20.737
 OK.

30:20.862 --> 30:24.115
He's all done, at least until
the sedative has worn off.

30:24.240 --> 30:25.700
 How long will that take?

30:25.825 --> 30:27.327
 A while yet.

30:27.452 --> 30:30.914
But we'll stay with him
until he's back on his feet.

30:31.039 --> 30:34.626
 Would you mind if I had
a moment alone with him?

30:34.751 --> 30:37.045
 Yeah, sure, that's fine.

30:37.170 --> 30:38.380
 Thanks.

30:38.505 --> 30:40.131
 You know, we can pack
up this stuff later.

30:51.893 --> 30:54.521
 You gotta be more careful.

30:54.646 --> 31:00.026
We got you all fixed up, but you
stay away from barbed wire, OK?

31:00.151 --> 31:03.071
Hey, do you remember Ty?

31:03.196 --> 31:04.531
We're gonna have a baby.

31:07.242 --> 31:10.453
We're gonna have a
family just like you.

31:10.578 --> 31:13.373
[horses nickering]

31:13.498 --> 31:17.377
[music playing]

31:23.800 --> 31:25.218
We're gonna be all right.

31:30.724 --> 31:31.975
 Really?

31:32.100 --> 31:34.853
What is there to
even say anymore?

31:34.978 --> 31:36.021
 I don't know.

31:38.356 --> 31:39.274
You tell me.

31:43.028 --> 31:48.074
I'm gonna bet that it's not
all about Clay going south.

31:48.199 --> 31:49.534
So what's the deal?

31:53.413 --> 31:54.289
Jade?

31:57.625 --> 32:00.086
OK, you don't want
to talk to me, fine.

32:04.215 --> 32:09.929
 Look, Tim, I know I've been
a total train wreck all year.

32:10.055 --> 32:16.019
 That's not true,
not completely.

32:16.144 --> 32:19.147
 No, I've been screwing
up all over the place.

32:19.272 --> 32:21.816
You're always the first
one to point it out.

32:21.941 --> 32:22.984
And you're right, OK?

32:23.109 --> 32:23.943
You're right.

32:24.069 --> 32:25.945
 Easy.

32:26.071 --> 32:31.242
OK, I'll admit, I've been a
little hard on you at times.

32:34.120 --> 32:36.748
But I also believe that there's
usually a reason why people

32:36.873 --> 32:38.166
go off the rails a little.

32:41.961 --> 32:45.965
Now, what did you mean about
everyone trying to get as

32:46.091 --> 32:47.467
far away from you as possible?

32:50.970 --> 32:54.599
 I'm just mad at Clay.

32:54.724 --> 32:56.685
 OK, we established that.

32:58.978 --> 33:00.021
What else?

33:04.192 --> 33:07.028
 My dad has this
new girlfriend.

33:07.153 --> 33:10.240
And she has kids, younger kids.

33:10.365 --> 33:14.160
And he's just really
busy all the time

33:14.285 --> 33:15.495
and he practically never calls.

33:21.835 --> 33:23.503
 What really happened
to the fishing trip?

33:27.424 --> 33:30.385
 His new daughter
had a dance recital.

33:34.514 --> 33:39.436
 It just-- it just feels
like he's completely

33:39.561 --> 33:43.815
forgotten about me, like I
don't even matter anymore.

33:43.940 --> 33:44.733
 Hey, come here.

33:52.407 --> 33:53.700
 It's a nice little church.

33:53.825 --> 33:54.951
You made a good choice.

33:55.076 --> 33:56.619
 I'm just glad I
was able to talk

33:56.745 --> 33:59.831
Caleb out of a Western themed
wedding at a rodeo arena.

33:59.956 --> 34:01.124
 [laughs]

34:01.249 --> 34:03.001
 No, I'm serious.

34:03.126 --> 34:04.878
 It might have been fun.

34:05.003 --> 34:07.088
 Hey, thanks, guys.

34:07.213 --> 34:10.507
I know it sounds weird, but
I finally feel like I made

34:10.632 --> 34:12.677
a connection with that horse.

34:12.802 --> 34:14.137
 That's great.

34:14.262 --> 34:15.388
I might not have been
able to get close enough

34:15.513 --> 34:17.223
to tranq him if you didn't.

34:17.349 --> 34:19.684
So I'm gonna go
check on the sutures

34:19.809 --> 34:21.226
while he's still
down for the count.

34:21.353 --> 34:23.730
 OK.

34:23.855 --> 34:30.195
 And you, you might have
saved that horse's life.

34:30.320 --> 34:31.279
 Thanks, grandpa.

34:34.199 --> 34:34.949
 Amy!

34:35.074 --> 34:36.117
Jack!

34:41.748 --> 34:42.916
 What happened?

34:43.041 --> 34:43.875
 He's gone.

34:44.000 --> 34:44.793
 Where did he get to?

34:44.918 --> 34:45.960
 I don't know.

34:46.085 --> 34:48.129
I came back and he wasn't here.

34:48.254 --> 34:49.922
 Maybe the sedative wore off.

34:50.047 --> 34:50.882
 No, it's too quick.

34:51.007 --> 34:51.800
That's impossible.

34:51.925 --> 34:53.385
 This is crazy.

34:53.510 --> 34:56.471
It's like he just disappeared.

35:05.188 --> 35:07.190
 So how'd it go with Jade?

35:07.315 --> 35:09.984
 It turns out it
wasn't all Clay.

35:10.110 --> 35:12.529
She had some issues
with her dad.

35:12.654 --> 35:14.072
 So does that mean my
nephew might actually

35:14.197 --> 35:16.825
be out of the doghouse?

35:16.950 --> 35:18.827
 Not even close.

35:18.952 --> 35:21.371
Because he's the one that
came up with that whole idea

35:21.496 --> 35:24.416
about the southern circuit.

35:24.541 --> 35:27.085
And you're gonna go on
it, too, aren't you?

35:27.210 --> 35:29.921
 I'd like to.

35:30.046 --> 35:33.091
But I would miss you like crazy.

35:33.216 --> 35:36.636
And the time would fly by.

35:36.761 --> 35:39.389
And you did say that you didn't
want to be the one to stand

35:39.514 --> 35:42.142
in between me and my dreams.

35:42.267 --> 35:43.393
 I said that?

35:43.518 --> 35:45.020
 You did, and I
love you for it.

35:45.145 --> 35:46.187
 I'm an idiot.

35:55.780 --> 35:57.240
There's nothing
for you over here.

35:57.365 --> 35:58.825
 [laughs]

36:10.587 --> 36:11.880
 Hey.

36:12.005 --> 36:13.673
 Hey.

36:13.798 --> 36:15.925
Can we talk?

36:16.051 --> 36:17.427
 I'm happy to take a break.

36:17.552 --> 36:18.803
 Clay's actually outside.

36:18.928 --> 36:19.721
 Oh, good.

36:25.185 --> 36:28.855
 So I've been thinking about
what you said yesterday.

36:28.980 --> 36:30.231
 Which part?

36:30.357 --> 36:33.902
 About that Adam guy.

36:34.027 --> 36:38.823
 My opinion is that
you have to go for it.

36:38.948 --> 36:42.202
Pull out all the stops,
let him know how you feel.

36:42.327 --> 36:47.290
Because if you can
say no to all of this,

36:47.415 --> 36:51.503
then that guy must be
pretty frickin' special.

36:54.381 --> 36:57.592
 It was great meeting you.

36:57.717 --> 36:59.427
 Yeah, you too.

37:02.722 --> 37:08.186
When I think of Hudson, it's
gonna be of you and how cool we

37:08.311 --> 37:10.772
look in these awesome costumes.

37:22.409 --> 37:24.035
 You look ridiculous.

37:24.160 --> 37:25.662
 Tell me about it.

37:25.787 --> 37:29.249
 Texas is sounding pretty
damn good right about now.

37:29.374 --> 37:32.419
 Sorry about my cousin
bugging poor Georgie again.

37:32.544 --> 37:34.170
 I'm sure she can handle it.

37:34.295 --> 37:35.422
Besides, how hard
can it be dealing

37:35.547 --> 37:36.881
with somebody who
actually wants to hang

37:37.007 --> 37:38.633
out with you all the time.

37:38.758 --> 37:40.051
Because it seems
like you can't wait

37:40.176 --> 37:41.886
to head in the opposite
direction from me.

37:42.012 --> 37:43.680
 Hold up.

37:43.805 --> 37:45.807
I'm not trying to
get away from you.

37:45.932 --> 37:48.018
I just want to compete.

37:48.143 --> 37:51.688
Like I said, things will pick
up exactly where we left off.

37:51.813 --> 37:55.483
 Oh, how nice of you to keep me
involved in your future plans.

37:55.608 --> 37:57.652
The only thing you're going to
be picking up when you get back

37:57.777 --> 38:01.239
to Hudson is your butt,
which I'm dumping right now

38:01.364 --> 38:04.159
and then kicking all over
the place next rodeo season.

38:04.284 --> 38:06.161
 Whoa.

38:06.286 --> 38:08.329
Should I go back in the barn?

38:08.455 --> 38:11.166
 No, I think we're done here.

38:11.291 --> 38:12.334
Happy trails.

38:15.628 --> 38:17.672
 Wow.

38:17.797 --> 38:20.675
Driving with the
top down is nothing.

38:20.800 --> 38:21.676
That felt cold.

38:32.020 --> 38:34.230
[video chat ringing]

38:34.356 --> 38:35.357
 Ty.

38:38.651 --> 38:41.488
Hey, thank God you're OK.

38:41.613 --> 38:42.822
Where have you been?

38:42.947 --> 38:43.990
Why haven't you been
answering my calls?

38:44.115 --> 38:45.784
 Calm down.

38:45.909 --> 38:48.411
I told you we went to a village
to immunize some livestock.

38:48.536 --> 38:50.163
It took a little longer
than we expected,

38:50.288 --> 38:51.331
so we stayed an extra night.

38:51.456 --> 38:53.333
 I was worried sick.

38:53.458 --> 38:55.460
 Everything's fine, Amy.

38:55.585 --> 38:56.878
 I'm sorry.

38:57.003 --> 38:59.839
It's just-- I'm having
these weird dreams.

38:59.964 --> 39:02.967
And-- and you know that
Appaloosa horse Ghost,

39:03.093 --> 39:04.177
he showed up here.

39:04.302 --> 39:06.429
 Ghost, from the fishing cabin?

39:06.554 --> 39:09.224
 Yeah, he was
injured really badly.

39:09.349 --> 39:11.685
And so it just made me feel like
something was wrong with you

39:11.810 --> 39:12.477
too.

39:12.602 --> 39:13.395
 Come on, Amy.

39:13.520 --> 39:15.522
 I know it sounds crazy.

39:15.647 --> 39:18.274
It's just the last
time I saw that horse,

39:18.400 --> 39:19.984
you had your
motorcycle accident.

39:20.110 --> 39:23.154
 You're right, that
does sound crazy.

39:23.279 --> 39:24.030
You said he was injured.

39:24.155 --> 39:24.989
Is he OK now?

39:25.115 --> 39:26.491
 I think he's gonna be OK.

39:26.616 --> 39:28.702
We were able to help him.

39:28.827 --> 39:30.829
But I went back to
check on him, Ty,

39:30.954 --> 39:34.833
and it was just
like he disappeared.

39:34.958 --> 39:36.543
 Weird.

39:36.668 --> 39:38.211
Well, you can relax.

39:38.336 --> 39:40.380
I'm OK.

39:40.505 --> 39:43.383
Completely exhausted, but I'm
excited to be coming home soon.

39:43.508 --> 39:44.342
 I know.

39:44.467 --> 39:46.011
I can't wait.

39:46.136 --> 39:48.722
I can't even believe that
you're coming home already.

39:48.847 --> 39:50.265
 Well, I have some
more unpacking to do.

39:50.390 --> 39:51.474
I'll call you back later, OK?

39:51.599 --> 39:52.976
 I love you so much.

39:53.101 --> 39:53.810
 I love you, too.

39:53.935 --> 39:54.769
Bye.

40:11.327 --> 40:13.288
 Ty, hey.

40:13.413 --> 40:14.914
Hey, hey.

40:15.040 --> 40:16.666
Another dizzy spell?

40:16.791 --> 40:17.959
You should sit down.

40:18.084 --> 40:19.002
 Yeah.

40:19.127 --> 40:19.961
 You good.

40:20.086 --> 40:21.212
 Yeah, I'm good.

40:21.338 --> 40:22.380
 I'll get you some water, OK?

40:22.505 --> 40:24.758
 I'm fine.

40:24.883 --> 40:27.761
I'm just-- just tired.

40:27.886 --> 40:29.637
 You been saying that
for a couple of days now.

40:29.763 --> 40:31.139
Here.

40:31.264 --> 40:33.850
 Thanks.

40:33.975 --> 40:35.769
 Dude, you are burning up.

40:35.894 --> 40:38.521
 I just need some sleep.

40:38.646 --> 40:40.273
I'll feel better
when I get some rest.

40:40.398 --> 40:44.819
[suspenseful music]

41:24.192 --> 41:26.277
 Hey, Adam it's me.

41:26.403 --> 41:27.278
I'm good.

41:27.404 --> 41:29.030
How are you?

41:29.155 --> 41:30.532
Good.

41:30.657 --> 41:34.160
Um, I was just wondering,
maybe we could get together.

41:34.285 --> 41:35.954
I just want to talk.

41:38.790 --> 41:40.000
OK.

41:40.125 --> 41:42.168
Yeah, yeah, sure,
it sounds good.

41:42.293 --> 41:43.420
All right, see you soon.

41:43.545 --> 41:44.629
Bye.

41:51.469 --> 41:52.971
 Hey, grandpa.

41:53.096 --> 41:55.306
 You look to be in
better spirits today.

41:55.432 --> 41:57.058
 I finally heard from Ty.

41:57.183 --> 41:57.976
And guess what?

41:58.101 --> 41:58.893
He's fine.

41:59.019 --> 42:00.603
So I was worrying for nothing.

42:00.729 --> 42:04.482
 I kind of figured
that was the case.

42:04.607 --> 42:07.068
 I wanted to thank you
for helping me with Ghost.

42:07.193 --> 42:08.862
 Well, happy to.

42:08.987 --> 42:12.073
I know that horse has a
special meaning to you.

42:12.198 --> 42:15.076
And I just hope you can
finally get some rest.

42:15.201 --> 42:17.203
 Well, I'm taking Spartan
out to get some exercise,

42:17.328 --> 42:19.539
and then I promise I will
give this whole napping

42:19.664 --> 42:21.583
thing another shot.

42:21.708 --> 42:23.209
 That sounds like a plan.

42:23.335 --> 42:24.836
 OK.
