00:00.080 --> 00:01.769
There's something about...

00:01.889 --> 00:03.199
what I've done...

00:03.929 --> 00:05.050
where I've been...

00:07.087 --> 00:08.396
I just don't know, David.

00:08.516 --> 00:11.848
Roth was doing something
in a secret lab for 3 months,

00:12.008 --> 00:15.185
doing something with Bob, and Bob
can't remember anything about it!

00:15.345 --> 00:16.895
Anything else come back to you ?

00:17.356 --> 00:19.639
I was with someone.
That same woman.

00:20.225 --> 00:23.139
We've had multiple cases of intravenous
drug users dying of liver failure.

00:23.259 --> 00:25.459
Is an existing Hep C
going into overdrive,

00:25.579 --> 00:27.614
or are we dealing
with something we've never seen?

00:28.528 --> 00:29.859
I've been infected.

00:29.979 --> 00:31.660
I'm proof the needles were tainted.

00:31.821 --> 00:33.820
Jesus.
We're looking at the wrong needles.

00:33.940 --> 00:35.872
You were stuck
with a blood collection needle.

00:36.032 --> 00:37.791
- What?
- One of the IDUs

00:37.951 --> 00:41.008
didn't want to get his blood tested
and I got caught in the struggle.

00:41.128 --> 00:44.839
I just got a positive from the Division
of Health's blood collecting needles.

00:44.999 --> 00:47.425
Somebody in this lab murdered 35 people

00:48.079 --> 00:50.512
and hung a death sentence
around hundreds of others.

00:51.709 --> 00:54.024
It's you. Jesus, you did it, didn't you?

00:55.403 --> 00:57.060
Your blood work came back.

00:57.355 --> 00:59.137
It's the Hep C super strain.

Oh, shit.

01:16.539 --> 01:18.707
Do I have to get a restraining order?

01:19.353 --> 01:22.139
I appreciate the dedication, Wes,
but you're sick.

01:22.259 --> 01:24.421
I was feeling fine
until I saw you, David.

01:24.581 --> 01:28.081
You should be in a hospital.
At least go home and get some rest.

01:28.682 --> 01:30.752
- I got a...
- Super Hep C, HIV.

01:30.872 --> 01:34.355
- Am I missing any letters?
- ... call from Riddlemeyer last night.

01:34.837 --> 01:38.951
You're on the largest dose of interferon
and ribavirin known to man.

01:39.071 --> 01:41.321
I know that's gotta make
you feel like shit.

01:41.864 --> 01:44.179
It does, but I'd rather feel like shit
at work than at home.

01:44.299 --> 01:46.519
But thanks for feigning concern.

01:48.343 --> 01:49.341
All right.

01:50.209 --> 01:51.720
Anything new on Cove?

01:52.060 --> 01:54.958
Police searched his house and
his cottage. They didn't find anything.

01:56.078 --> 01:58.413
I'll take a look
at the security tapes from his lab.

01:58.573 --> 02:00.110
That's all I'm saying, all right?

02:00.230 --> 02:03.422
Anyway, what's Carl got
his underwear in a knot for?

02:03.542 --> 02:06.902
There's an unusually high incidence
of brain inflammation in Michigan.

02:07.022 --> 02:09.007
Tell 'em to stop watching
professional wrestling.

02:09.616 --> 02:12.058
The local doctor thought
that it was bacterial meningitis.

02:12.178 --> 02:14.546
Now he thinks
it's progressive multifocal

02:14.666 --> 02:17.057
- leukoencepha...
- Encephalopathy?

02:17.217 --> 02:19.934
That's PML.
What's he going to think it is tomorrow?

02:20.054 --> 02:21.593
I don't know. Ask him.

02:21.713 --> 02:23.629
He's got 11 people
on the verge of death.

02:23.749 --> 02:25.690
You and Carlos
are on the 12:10 to Iron River.

02:26.367 --> 02:28.193
Is everybody at the CDC on vacation?

02:29.563 --> 02:31.116
You're staying at Mabel's Motel.

02:31.236 --> 02:33.204
I understand
they just got color television.

02:33.324 --> 02:34.247
Great.

02:35.036 --> 02:36.690
- You look good.
- She's lying.

02:36.810 --> 02:37.756
Shut up.

02:44.582 --> 02:47.212
It's just hard to believe
we're dealing with a PML epidemic.

02:47.529 --> 02:49.631
It's caused by a very common virus.

02:49.791 --> 02:53.334
Only people whose immune systems
aren't working get sick, like...

02:53.959 --> 02:55.804
organ transplant recipients or...

02:56.518 --> 02:57.986
Cancer, AIDS...

02:58.758 --> 03:01.893
- Your patients' immune system are fine.
- What are the other symptoms?

03:02.499 --> 03:05.688
Progressive weakness,
visual and speech deterioration.

03:07.159 --> 03:09.203
And eventually you get ataxia,

03:09.323 --> 03:11.107
paralysis and coma.

03:14.103 --> 03:16.241
We think it's spreading.

03:17.095 --> 03:18.340
Contagious PML?

03:18.903 --> 03:20.418
That's not possible.

03:20.905 --> 03:22.581
Look, I'm sorry, Dr. Kavanaugh,

03:22.701 --> 03:24.885
but we're gonna have to start
with the assumption

03:25.005 --> 03:28.044
that your lab tests are all screwed,
because if they're not, we are.

03:29.831 --> 03:31.675
Now you know why we called you.

Oxford's still in animal trials
on their Hep C cure, but they gave me

05:06.677 --> 05:09.587
the name of a Dutch scientist,
so I'm on my way to Amsterdam.

05:09.707 --> 05:13.069
I got a lead on some
new HCV research and...

05:13.302 --> 05:15.443
How did it go with the cannabinoid
inhibitor treatment?

05:16.472 --> 05:17.442
Good.

05:17.824 --> 05:19.128
Good. It went good.

05:19.899 --> 05:21.738
- Good but not great.
- No, it was fine.

05:21.858 --> 05:24.132
I just want to check out
this thing in Amsterdam.

05:24.252 --> 05:26.920
Apparently they're using these...

05:27.040 --> 05:31.034
these engineered red blood cells
to have HCV receptors in them.

05:33.507 --> 05:35.531
You there?
You wanna hear how it works?

05:36.883 --> 05:37.944
Not really.

05:38.906 --> 05:41.268
Wes, have you started
the antidepressants?

05:42.029 --> 05:45.110
Rachel, I need to take a pill just to
remember all the pills I need to take.

05:45.230 --> 05:47.267
Depression is a serious
side effect of interferon

05:47.427 --> 05:50.096
and you're on a massive dose, so you...

05:50.216 --> 05:52.234
I'm fine. Don't worry about it.

05:55.348 --> 05:56.489
Okay, listen...

05:57.714 --> 05:59.422
I'm gonna call you
from Amsterdam,

05:59.542 --> 06:02.239
but I want you to call me...

06:03.532 --> 06:06.402
if you wanna talk, okay?
Anytime. I mean it.

06:07.321 --> 06:09.721
The other line is ringing, Rachel.
I gotta go.

06:15.246 --> 06:17.046
Anyway, he doesn't want to go home.

06:17.695 --> 06:20.717
Keep an eye on him, 'cause Wes
doesn't know how bad off he is.

06:20.877 --> 06:23.308
<i>Bob's been checking on him
practically every half hour.</i>

06:23.428 --> 06:25.888
<i>Don't worry about him, David.
It's very unlike you.</i>

06:26.309 --> 06:27.320
<i>You're right.</i>

06:27.732 --> 06:29.224
So how's it going
down there?

06:29.344 --> 06:31.179
<i>Seem to be doing
all the right tests.</i>

06:31.448 --> 06:33.146
<i>Blood work confirms
everything he said.</i>

06:33.306 --> 06:36.399
The CAT scans show
lesions and that says PML.

06:36.760 --> 06:38.985
PML is caused by the JC virus, right?

06:39.685 --> 06:42.390
Correct. 80% of the population
has JC in them.

06:42.510 --> 06:44.907
In normal people, the virus hangs out
in the brain...

06:45.118 --> 06:48.326
Yeah, and it's kept in check
by the body's immune system.

06:48.446 --> 06:50.694
But if your immune system
goes on the fritz,

06:50.814 --> 06:53.427
it gets a chance to go to town
and it dissolves your brain.

06:53.547 --> 06:56.575
But I thought you said these people,
their immune systems are fine.

06:56.695 --> 06:58.796
They are. That's what's unexplainable.

06:59.080 --> 07:00.960
What the hell is happening here?

07:02.167 --> 07:06.201
What if the JC is not causing
the disease, but is triggered by it?

07:06.321 --> 07:08.681
A by-product.
That's an interesting idea.

07:08.973 --> 07:11.059
<i>I'm going to check
for infectious agents.</i>

07:11.219 --> 07:13.597
I'll collect blood, urine,
cerebrospinal fluid.

07:13.717 --> 07:15.438
- Start with Patient Zero.
- Right.

07:17.961 --> 07:20.568
<i>Hey, Mayko, can you switch me
over to Bob?</i>

07:20.778 --> 07:21.778
<i>Yeah, sure.</i>

07:23.890 --> 07:24.883
Hey, Bob.

07:25.751 --> 07:26.554
Hello.

07:26.674 --> 07:29.529
<i>Samples will be there tonight.
Let me know when they arrive.</i>

07:29.649 --> 07:32.076
<i>It'll be marked what to do.
I want everything started tonight.</i>

07:32.196 --> 07:34.883
<i>We should be back in TO by...
late morning.</i>

07:35.508 --> 07:38.016
- <i>Sure. No problem.</i>
- How are you doing?

07:38.136 --> 07:40.011
<i>I'm OK. No temperature.
Fewer headaches.</i>

07:40.498 --> 07:42.783
- Take it easy.
- I'm fine, David.

07:42.903 --> 07:44.342
<i>You keeping an eye on Wes?</i>

07:45.033 --> 07:47.761
- He's very depressed, David.
- Yeah, I know, Mayko told me.

07:48.745 --> 07:51.028
Listen, just...
talk to him.

07:51.336 --> 07:54.147
That's really the best thing. Talking.

07:55.393 --> 07:56.270
Yeah. Okay.

07:56.736 --> 07:58.151
I'll see you tomorrow.

08:41.859 --> 08:42.942
Hello, Weston.

08:47.007 --> 08:47.989
Hi, Bob.

08:49.386 --> 08:50.741
Beautiful day, isn't it?

08:51.820 --> 08:52.870
Yeah.

08:52.990 --> 08:56.629
Cirrus castellanus are
my favourite clouds.

08:56.749 --> 08:59.327
I especially love
the "towers" of cirrus,

08:59.447 --> 09:01.419
connected by a thinner base.

09:13.863 --> 09:15.471
My eyes are bleeding, Bob.

09:16.730 --> 09:18.530
They've been bleeding all morning.

09:18.650 --> 09:20.891
It's a side effect of the interferon.

09:21.836 --> 09:23.252
My eyes are bleeding.

09:27.328 --> 09:29.711
And my HIV's gonna turn to AIDS, Bob.

09:31.087 --> 09:32.662
Don't worry about it.

09:33.639 --> 09:36.245
Why don't we go downstairs
and I'll get some tea?

09:36.564 --> 09:40.509
I can make you your favourite sandwich
and we can sit down to talk...

09:44.536 --> 09:46.059
That'd be nice, Bob.

09:48.450 --> 09:49.505
Let's go.

09:50.161 --> 09:52.083
I'll meet you downstairs, okay?

09:53.231 --> 09:54.731
Come on, let's go.

09:56.841 --> 09:59.888
I just need a minute by myself, Bob.
I'll be down.

10:06.004 --> 10:07.949
I... I can't leave you up...

10:41.451 --> 10:43.537
This is a spinal fluid tap.

10:47.099 --> 10:51.015
I know after a few days in the hospital,
you'll feel a bit like a pincushion.

10:51.772 --> 10:52.679
Hey, Dad.

10:54.507 --> 10:55.585
Excuse me...

10:58.175 --> 10:59.417
I'm his daughter.

11:01.526 --> 11:02.873
Maybe you can help me.

11:06.876 --> 11:09.132
- Could you finish up, please?
- Yes, Doctor.

11:13.294 --> 11:14.927
I'm Dr. Carlos Serrano.

11:15.399 --> 11:16.600
Marie Gervais.

11:16.720 --> 11:19.839
- Your father was the first to get sick?
- Three weeks ago.

11:20.160 --> 11:21.745
I've never even heard of...

11:21.865 --> 11:23.019
progressive multi...

11:23.593 --> 11:27.248
Focal leukoencephalopathy.
PML. It's very rare.

11:29.017 --> 11:30.236
Why my dad?

11:30.799 --> 11:32.017
He was healthy.

11:32.416 --> 11:35.031
He never smoked. Rarely drinks.

11:36.189 --> 11:39.535
Has he done anything different lately,
been anywhere,

11:39.695 --> 11:41.272
changed his routine at all?

11:41.510 --> 11:42.652
No. Oh...

11:43.420 --> 11:45.041
he doesn't go hunting anymore.

11:45.402 --> 11:46.208
Why?

11:46.726 --> 11:47.898
When our dog...

11:48.554 --> 11:51.630
got hit... when she died,
he took it pretty bad.

11:52.751 --> 11:53.570
I see.

11:55.085 --> 11:55.885
Listen...

11:57.611 --> 12:00.598
my dad's pretty upset because...

12:01.028 --> 12:03.267
everyone thinks
he made everyone else sick.

12:03.427 --> 12:06.604
We don't even know if it's contagious,
and if it is contagious,

12:06.764 --> 12:08.592
then someone gave it to him, right?

12:09.416 --> 12:10.232
Look...

12:10.725 --> 12:12.108
Here's my cell.

12:12.600 --> 12:14.616
Call me if you have any questions.

12:14.920 --> 12:16.045
Okay. Thanks.

12:21.085 --> 12:22.328
How're we making out?

12:23.030 --> 12:24.249
Hang on a second.

12:26.194 --> 12:27.014
What?

12:30.120 --> 12:30.940
What?

12:34.040 --> 12:35.007
Ah, fuck...

12:38.903 --> 12:39.782
Okay.

13:07.074 --> 13:08.650
"... laughter from the gallery.

13:08.770 --> 13:12.079
"Rathin had traveled 3,100 miles
around a concrete block in Queens..."

13:17.293 --> 13:18.964
Hey, David. Carlos.

13:20.483 --> 13:21.846
It's mainly his left side.

13:22.006 --> 13:23.305
Fractured distal tibia,

13:23.835 --> 13:27.444
- broken femur but he's going to be OK.
- Any internal damage?

13:27.666 --> 13:29.562
They've done preliminaries,
but no word yet.

13:29.821 --> 13:32.523
He's scheduled for a full body scan
tomorrow morning.

13:34.356 --> 13:35.693
They took him off interferon.

13:38.011 --> 13:41.671
David, the HCV will close in now.
It's just a matter of time.

13:46.943 --> 13:48.496
I should've stopped him.

13:49.644 --> 13:50.958
I didn't know what to say.

13:51.118 --> 13:53.210
Bob, this had nothing to do with you.

13:53.453 --> 13:54.665
I know, David.

13:57.367 --> 14:00.133
- Could you take Bob back to my place?
- Yeah.

14:01.621 --> 14:02.629
Later, Bob.

14:47.784 --> 14:49.558
Must've died and gone to hell.

14:51.979 --> 14:54.897
You're interrupting me in the middle
of an online Scrabble game.

14:55.471 --> 14:56.607
Does Rachel know?

14:57.510 --> 14:58.623
Oh yeah.

15:00.686 --> 15:01.946
How'd she take it?

15:03.383 --> 15:05.501
The fact that you tried
to commit suicide

15:05.621 --> 15:07.660
or the fact that you're still alive?

15:09.968 --> 15:12.707
She took it on the chin,
like she does everything.

15:16.469 --> 15:17.670
How's he doing?

15:17.830 --> 15:21.632
Oh yeah, I'm supposed to ask that.
How you doing, Wes?

15:21.792 --> 15:23.165
Lotta pain, I hope.

15:23.834 --> 15:24.912
I'm good.

15:26.071 --> 15:28.368
Nice and doped up, thanks.

15:28.488 --> 15:30.665
Think you're ready for a little water?

15:30.785 --> 15:32.142
Maybe you'd like to help.

15:32.751 --> 15:33.758
Oh, sure.

15:35.889 --> 15:36.862
Thanks.

15:41.479 --> 15:42.698
All right, Wes.

15:45.394 --> 15:46.378
Okay.

15:49.847 --> 15:53.099
Got an email from Rachel last night,
as a matter of fact.

15:53.449 --> 15:57.042
Discovered some interesting work
being done on HCV in Amsterdam.

15:58.115 --> 16:00.388
Very, very encouraged.

16:03.043 --> 16:05.358
- I wish I had a camera.
- Why?

16:06.280 --> 16:09.555
I don't think anybody's ever seen you
be nice to me, David.

16:10.472 --> 16:12.016
Don't get used to it.

16:29.738 --> 16:32.508
Okay, what's with this mysterious email
you sent me?

16:32.628 --> 16:34.163
Wes requested surveillance tapes

16:34.324 --> 16:36.699
from Toronto Division of Health.
Watch this.

16:36.956 --> 16:38.925
This is the back of Cove's lab.

16:39.511 --> 16:40.507
Just wait.

16:45.241 --> 16:46.675
That's Cove.

16:47.140 --> 16:48.850
What's he taking out of there?

16:48.970 --> 16:52.473
- Tainted blood collection kits, maybe?
- It's hard to prove from this tape.

16:52.633 --> 16:54.934
Maybe we can find them.
He had to have hid them someplace.

16:55.054 --> 16:56.929
No, he would have thrown them
out by now.

16:57.049 --> 16:59.647
- David, we don't have to find them.
- Why?

16:59.959 --> 17:01.523
This is from last Sunday,

17:01.939 --> 17:04.327
after the lab
was declared a crime scene.

17:05.968 --> 17:07.866
Obstruction of justice?

17:09.425 --> 17:10.362
Okay...

17:10.925 --> 17:12.326
Good work, Mayko.

17:12.925 --> 17:13.952
Thank you.

17:14.895 --> 17:16.934
- Ready?
- Yeah. Two minutes.

17:22.113 --> 17:23.707
Bob. Conference room.

17:28.160 --> 17:29.051
Bob?

18:06.376 --> 18:07.712
Conference room.

18:12.329 --> 18:13.689
Conference room.

18:19.123 --> 18:21.516
- How was your check up?
- I'm going tomorrow.

18:22.716 --> 18:24.500
You still on the chloramphenicol?

18:26.177 --> 18:27.776
Yeah, portable pump delivers

18:28.333 --> 18:30.529
- 24 hours a day.
- Jesus.

18:30.689 --> 18:33.363
Kind of toxic
to be on an IV of the stuff, isn't it?

18:33.483 --> 18:35.826
It's effective on penetrating
the blood-brain barrier.

18:35.986 --> 18:38.287
You don't want the cure
to do more damage than the problem.

18:40.968 --> 18:42.163
How is Weston?

18:42.421 --> 18:44.668
Hangin' in there.
Whaddaya got on Iron River?

18:45.292 --> 18:47.988
The CAT scan and the cerebrospinal fluid

18:48.108 --> 18:51.197
still indicate progressive
multifocal leukoencephalopathy.

18:51.317 --> 18:54.720
- Blood work?
- No rabies, no viral meningitis...

18:54.840 --> 18:57.181
pathology comes up negative
on everything.

18:58.698 --> 19:01.956
Preliminary environmental tests
came back negative on air and soil.

19:02.076 --> 19:05.522
Some well water samples contained
low levels of PCBs and mercury.

19:05.873 --> 19:09.568
Here's the data. You'll have the results
on the full matrix of tests Monday PM.

19:09.728 --> 19:12.021
The MRI's confirm lesions in the brain.

19:13.300 --> 19:14.364
We have a disease

19:14.524 --> 19:16.729
that's affecting people
who should be able to fight it

19:16.849 --> 19:19.078
and it seems to be spreading
when it shouldn't.

19:19.238 --> 19:20.412
That's about it.

19:20.953 --> 19:22.688
But why? What's triggering it?

19:23.063 --> 19:27.294
We're testing for West Nile, St. Louis,
Western Equine encephalopathy...

19:27.454 --> 19:29.912
We have the university labs
running down the usual vectors...

19:30.032 --> 19:32.930
they're testing local mosquitoes,
ticks, parasites.

19:33.050 --> 19:36.359
Good. Bob,
could you run PCR diagnostics for...

19:38.175 --> 19:38.975
Bob?

19:42.425 --> 19:45.478
Could you run PCR diagnostic tests
on measles, mumps, rubella,

19:45.652 --> 19:47.327
EBV and chickenpox?

19:48.530 --> 19:50.053
Are we that desperate?

19:50.686 --> 19:52.861
Yeah. Let's get to work.

19:55.857 --> 19:57.159
Not you, Bob.

20:01.979 --> 20:04.427
Are you all right?
You got a headache or...

20:06.615 --> 20:08.710
I'm experiencing strange memories.

20:08.870 --> 20:10.003
Like what?

20:10.614 --> 20:12.807
They're surreal, but I'm there again.

20:12.927 --> 20:14.509
- Where?
- Roth's lab.

20:15.516 --> 20:16.954
Except it's deserted.

20:17.901 --> 20:18.704
Okay.

20:20.004 --> 20:20.952
Anything else?

20:21.331 --> 20:24.647
See, I'm trying to remember
what happened at Roth's lab, but...

20:24.767 --> 20:27.559
it's like I'm reliving it but I'm...

20:27.813 --> 20:28.863
awake.

20:31.112 --> 20:31.931
Okay...

20:33.065 --> 20:37.056
It may just be you still have swelling
on your brain, okay?

20:37.176 --> 20:40.285
Make sure you tell all this
to your neurologist tomorrow.

20:49.051 --> 20:51.336
I had a thought about Iron River.
Parasites, like...

20:51.496 --> 20:53.725
toxoplasmosis,
can also cause brain inflammation

20:53.845 --> 20:55.674
in people with weakened immune systems.

20:56.290 --> 20:57.678
I'll look into that.

20:58.076 --> 20:59.362
Yeah. Good idea.

20:59.855 --> 21:00.938
Thanks, Bob.

21:44.350 --> 21:46.892
See that, Bob?
That might be some residual pus.

21:47.473 --> 21:50.354
If it is, the antibiotics
still haven't cleared up the infection.

21:50.514 --> 21:52.439
- It's not spreading.
- No, but

21:52.600 --> 21:56.068
that doesn't mean I'm happy about it.
If it's infected, I need to drain it.

21:58.039 --> 21:59.260
No more surgery.

21:59.537 --> 22:01.449
I need to go in and examine it.

22:01.569 --> 22:05.286
If it's infected, I can find the best
antibiotic to kill the infection.

22:05.406 --> 22:07.161
I'm having these...

22:07.497 --> 22:08.672
memories...

22:09.765 --> 22:11.305
hallucinations.

22:11.425 --> 22:14.336
Even some mild swelling can cause that.
How bad?

22:15.141 --> 22:16.833
It's affecting my work.

22:18.045 --> 22:19.095
I can't sleep.

22:19.215 --> 22:20.671
I can't concentrate.

22:22.132 --> 22:24.204
I heard about this drug called...

22:24.504 --> 22:25.514
Imipramine...

22:25.674 --> 22:28.725
It's an anti-depressant that has
good effects with post-traumatic stress.

22:29.039 --> 22:30.686
Will it block all my memories?

22:30.846 --> 22:32.051
You know the drill...

22:32.171 --> 22:34.815
different subjects, different reactions.

22:36.564 --> 22:37.884
I wanna try it.

22:39.350 --> 22:42.041
Patient Zero, Gervais, died last night.

22:42.161 --> 22:44.574
Two young girls, twins,
slipped into a coma

22:44.734 --> 22:47.043
and another three admitted to hospital.

22:47.163 --> 22:51.106
Environmental update just came in.
They found traces of vinyl chloride.

22:51.226 --> 22:53.480
That's been connected to brain cancer,
hasn't it?

22:53.600 --> 22:56.003
Cancer yes,
not conclusively linked to brain cancer.

22:57.381 --> 22:59.673
- Didn't we drive by a landfill site?
- Yeah.

23:00.313 --> 23:03.093
Hair sprays and aerosols
used to contain vinyl chloride.

23:03.306 --> 23:05.447
A lot of vinyl chloride comes from
the breakdown of TCE,

23:05.567 --> 23:08.015
- stuff in dry cleaning.
- Also computer chips.

23:08.135 --> 23:10.808
- Have we looked at the manufacturing?
- There is no manufacturing.

23:12.850 --> 23:15.480
Inbreeding is starting to sound like
a very good possibility.

23:15.850 --> 23:19.484
No. I did a genome-wide SNP analysis
of all the patients.

23:19.644 --> 23:21.069
No obvious links between them.

23:22.412 --> 23:24.656
Why aren't we seeing PML
in any other towns?

23:24.850 --> 23:28.199
Why just Iron River? What's so special
about Iron River? What?

23:30.099 --> 23:30.903
Yeah.

23:32.520 --> 23:33.331
Really?

23:34.099 --> 23:35.668
He wants to make a deal?

23:35.788 --> 23:37.961
Why don't you tell Dr. Cove
to go fuck himself?

23:39.914 --> 23:41.048
Don't even ask.

24:00.317 --> 24:01.316
I'm sorry.

24:02.075 --> 24:03.599
Wes, it was the drugs.

24:03.913 --> 24:05.947
I just couldn't keep myself together.

24:06.107 --> 24:08.567
I just...
I've never felt so out of control.

24:08.913 --> 24:11.041
- I don't...
- Oh, stop. Stop.

24:11.161 --> 24:12.483
You're freezing...

24:16.475 --> 24:18.210
I don't want to be in this bed...

24:18.535 --> 24:20.087
I don't want to die, Rachel.

24:22.225 --> 24:23.656
You're not gonna die.

24:24.475 --> 24:25.763
Tell me the truth.

24:31.160 --> 24:33.712
The cannabinoid treatment in London...

24:34.556 --> 24:36.353
I'm still not sure about it.

24:36.513 --> 24:38.271
What about the Amsterdam treatment?

24:41.657 --> 24:43.527
It's too experimental.

24:45.724 --> 24:46.905
So that's it?

24:48.312 --> 24:51.934
Without treatment,
the HCV is gonna double every 12 hours.

24:54.162 --> 24:57.382
With the interferon,
I'm throwing myself off the roof.

25:00.100 --> 25:01.753
Give me the Amsterdam treatment.

25:02.224 --> 25:03.797
It's not just unproven...

25:03.975 --> 25:07.303
- it could be dangerous.
- Without it, I'm gonna die, Rachel.

25:07.423 --> 25:08.844
Do it. Give me the treatment.

25:11.349 --> 25:12.931
You gotta give me hope.

25:14.538 --> 25:17.185
There is one more possibility.
In Germany...

25:17.551 --> 25:20.348
I was talking with some people
in Berlin and it looks promising...

25:20.468 --> 25:22.065
Give me the treatment.

25:24.219 --> 25:25.485
I'll look into it.

25:25.849 --> 25:26.649
Okay?

25:32.522 --> 25:33.893
I love you, Rachel.

25:37.695 --> 25:39.168
You're not gonna die.

25:53.694 --> 25:57.625
So I've been analyzing our DNA sequence
data from the Iron River patients.

25:57.745 --> 25:59.561
I got a hit on some non-human DNA.

25:59.722 --> 26:02.848
- It's an unknown virus.
- How long to complete the genome?

26:02.968 --> 26:04.237
In about an hour.

26:05.226 --> 26:06.278
Hey, guys.

26:06.536 --> 26:08.001
Is everything okay?

26:08.668 --> 26:11.185
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Yes.

26:15.954 --> 26:17.871
I met with Dr. Van de Moortel
in Amsterdam.

26:18.259 --> 26:19.597
How's she doing?

26:19.717 --> 26:21.292
She sends her fondest.

26:21.412 --> 26:22.718
Her fondest, eh?

26:23.437 --> 26:25.367
How's Anika looking these days?

26:27.311 --> 26:28.402
You know, gorgeous.

26:28.522 --> 26:30.605
I let that one slip away.
I should call her.

26:30.725 --> 26:34.040
- She just got engaged.
- I'll wait 6 months. What's she up to?

26:34.160 --> 26:38.229
Basically, her lab has engineered
red blood cells to express CD81.

26:38.349 --> 26:40.532
It's a cell-surface receptor
for the HCV.

26:40.652 --> 26:45.094
So, the Hep C virus attaches itself
to the modified red blood cells,

26:45.214 --> 26:48.472
it thinks it's some liver,
crawls inside and it's trapped and...

26:48.862 --> 26:52.322
HCV can't replicate in red blood cells.
Can't get out. This is very clever.

26:52.684 --> 26:53.987
Very. Very clever.

26:55.595 --> 26:56.978
But, of course,

26:57.416 --> 26:58.911
lots of potential problems.

26:59.072 --> 27:02.210
Like what happens if his body rejects
the engineered cells?

27:02.661 --> 27:04.361
It's working in the mice.

27:05.774 --> 27:09.244
Yeah, I know. They hope to start
human trials in 18 months.

27:10.093 --> 27:11.989
Wes doesn't have 18 days.

27:12.661 --> 27:13.763
Yeah. I know.

27:15.722 --> 27:17.061
No, he can't wait.

27:18.341 --> 27:20.433
But you don't wanna kill him, though,
either, right?

27:20.593 --> 27:22.813
- We need to do something.
- Is this the right "something"?

27:22.933 --> 27:25.730
I don't know! I don't have
another "something." This is the best...

27:25.890 --> 27:27.961
It might also be the worst, Rachel.

27:29.411 --> 27:30.293
I know.

27:33.422 --> 27:34.664
I told Wes.

27:34.784 --> 27:36.123
He wants to do it.

27:44.284 --> 27:46.185
There is one other possibility.

27:48.599 --> 27:49.515
There is?

27:52.536 --> 27:54.981
- You know Cove's in custody, right?
- Yeah?

27:55.101 --> 27:58.539
He's charged with second-degree murder
for tainting the needles with HCV.

27:58.659 --> 28:00.006
I got a call today.

28:02.134 --> 28:03.685
He wants to make a deal.

28:03.997 --> 28:05.729
He says he has a cure.

28:05.889 --> 28:07.480
I think he's full of shit. But...

28:07.640 --> 28:09.274
I'm setting something up.

28:10.971 --> 28:12.318
And there she goes.

28:15.311 --> 28:16.811
No exact match.

28:16.931 --> 28:19.436
- We've discovered a new virus.
- Cool.

28:20.066 --> 28:21.786
What are its closest relatives?

28:22.649 --> 28:25.725
Okay: baboon cytomegalovirus...

28:26.114 --> 28:30.193
95% genetic similarity
to our unknown virus.

28:30.313 --> 28:32.414
Human cytomegalovirus...

28:32.534 --> 28:35.439
- 94% genetic similarity.
- So our unknown virus,

28:35.559 --> 28:39.170
I think we can conclude,
is in the cytomegalovirus family.

28:39.381 --> 28:40.833
Wait. Look at this.

28:42.229 --> 28:45.435
These are short stretches of DNA.
But 100% matches.

28:45.595 --> 28:46.885
Canine DNA?

28:47.055 --> 28:49.997
It's from the Dog Genome Project.
Oh, shit. You know what they did?

28:50.117 --> 28:52.095
They thought
they were just sequencing dog DNA,

28:52.215 --> 28:55.403
but they ended up sequencing viral DNA
that was in the dogs' cells.

28:57.057 --> 28:59.429
Which means that our mystery virus...

29:01.547 --> 29:03.029
Comes from dogs.

29:03.512 --> 29:04.680
One problem...

29:05.964 --> 29:08.333
Canine CMV has not been found.

29:08.588 --> 29:09.404
Well,

29:09.642 --> 29:12.042
- maybe we found it.
- Who are you calling?

29:12.473 --> 29:13.713
I used to date a vet.

29:14.629 --> 29:16.716
Probably the only woman
who ever understood you.

29:18.047 --> 29:18.884
Virginia.

29:19.046 --> 29:22.305
David Sandström. Professional call.
I'm gonna put you on speaker.

29:23.593 --> 29:26.282
Virginia,
what do you know about canine CMV?

29:26.402 --> 29:28.763
<i>Nothing. We don't see it, Sandström.</i>

29:29.012 --> 29:30.015
Yeah, I know.

29:30.135 --> 29:33.171
There must be thousands of viruses
that you haven't identified.

29:33.291 --> 29:36.086
Is canine CMV theoretically possible?

29:36.357 --> 29:39.773
<i>Absolutely, but if a canine CMV exists,
it would have to be benign.</i>

29:39.893 --> 29:41.741
<i>The nasty ones, we identify.</i>

29:41.901 --> 29:45.123
<i>So I guess the answer is:
Sure, it could and probably does exist.</i>

29:45.243 --> 29:48.651
That's the answer I wanted.
You and I should get together some...

29:48.771 --> 29:49.749
Whatever.

29:50.020 --> 29:51.626
But this virus is not benign, David.

29:51.892 --> 29:53.795
In humans. I'm betting it is in dogs.

29:54.777 --> 29:57.422
Valganciclovir works on human CMV.

29:57.542 --> 30:00.527
If it works on canine CMV,
we'll be able to stop this thing.

30:00.647 --> 30:01.970
It's worth a try.

30:12.504 --> 30:16.025
- Thank you for coming.
- Let's just hope it's worth our time.

30:16.185 --> 30:18.622
I don't generally visit mass murderers.

30:20.984 --> 30:22.528
So what have you got?

30:24.790 --> 30:26.536
Are you capable of making a deal?

30:26.697 --> 30:30.165
No, but the people who can want us
to make sure you're not full of shit.

30:31.666 --> 30:33.383
Sorry about your administrator.

30:33.503 --> 30:34.306
Why?

30:34.967 --> 30:36.763
Because he's not a junkie?

30:36.883 --> 30:40.240
It's okay to kill junkies,
but not to kill other people, right?

30:40.360 --> 30:41.926
Perhaps we can talk about my cure?

30:42.755 --> 30:44.637
- Piece of shit!
- Stop it!

30:44.798 --> 30:45.722
Stop!

30:45.883 --> 30:47.182
It's okay. We're okay.

30:47.343 --> 30:49.559
Why the fuck
should we believe you've got a cure?

30:50.940 --> 30:54.643
Because I had to watch
my daughter suffer with HCV for 5 years.

30:57.126 --> 30:59.980
- So I did everything I could.
- But you do have a cure.

31:00.146 --> 31:00.947
Yes.

31:02.427 --> 31:03.649
Toll receptors.

31:03.769 --> 31:05.905
I was working on a cure
with Toll receptor activators.

31:06.025 --> 31:08.677
It's a drug that convinces
the immune system it's under attack.

31:08.797 --> 31:10.496
We know what Toll receptors are.

31:10.616 --> 31:12.581
But did you get them
fighting a Hep C virus?

31:12.865 --> 31:13.670
Yes.

31:13.969 --> 31:16.503
Lot of people playing in that yard.
The trials are failing.

31:18.724 --> 31:19.964
Not my trials.

31:20.433 --> 31:22.008
Success rates are in the teens.

31:22.711 --> 31:24.728
I got 64% before I quit.

31:24.953 --> 31:26.058
With mice.

31:27.399 --> 31:28.635
With humans.

31:29.274 --> 31:30.767
Want to get more specific?

31:30.928 --> 31:31.742
Sure.

31:33.018 --> 31:34.896
As soon as you get me out of this place.

31:35.612 --> 31:37.376
We're gonna need some proof.

31:43.459 --> 31:45.323
How would you like
to look at my lab books?

31:54.019 --> 31:55.583
I tested for the CMV you sent me

31:55.747 --> 31:58.538
and found it in 5 of the 9 dogs
currently in my clinic.

31:58.658 --> 32:00.755
- Are they sick with it?
- No. But all 5 have

32:00.916 --> 32:03.464
Canine Transmissible Venereal Tumour.

32:03.584 --> 32:07.054
It's a communicable dog cancer,
where dogs pass cancer to one another?

32:07.174 --> 32:09.626
Right, through sex, licking, biting.

32:09.746 --> 32:12.392
I have a list of the PML patients...

32:12.553 --> 32:14.828
do any of the 5 dogs belong to them?

32:15.398 --> 32:16.396
Ted Wynn...

32:16.557 --> 32:19.232
His dog
Fergie had communicable dog cancer

32:19.392 --> 32:20.970
and died about a month ago.

32:21.314 --> 32:22.777
And Sally Cawthra.

32:22.938 --> 32:25.632
Her dog Dixie was sick with it
but recovered.

32:25.752 --> 32:28.449
- I didn't know she was sick.
- Just admitted.

32:28.812 --> 32:31.271
Where do you think the outbreak started?

32:31.715 --> 32:34.372
Gervais, Patient Zero,
did his dog have it?

32:34.533 --> 32:35.415
Boomer? No.

32:35.692 --> 32:37.014
Not that I know of.

32:37.567 --> 32:38.918
Now that we know of.

32:39.681 --> 32:40.570
True.

32:40.872 --> 32:43.172
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

32:45.844 --> 32:47.094
Yeah, David, it's me.

32:47.214 --> 32:50.094
I think you'd better get back
to Iron River as soon as possible.

32:50.214 --> 32:51.370
Call me back.

32:53.108 --> 32:54.416
We tested...

32:55.158 --> 32:58.021
All our patients
have the canine CMV you sent.

32:58.904 --> 33:01.950
We also tried the drug you suggested.
On the twins.

33:02.183 --> 33:03.318
They're improving.

33:03.839 --> 33:05.546
Finally, some good news.

33:06.853 --> 33:08.072
She's in there.

33:10.040 --> 33:12.535
Oh, and by the way, nice haircut.

33:18.492 --> 33:20.100
Marie, I'm so sorry...

33:22.919 --> 33:24.819
I guess it is contagious.

33:26.145 --> 33:29.093
But you did not get this
from your father. No one did.

33:32.284 --> 33:33.973
Marie Gervais, this is my colleague,

33:34.134 --> 33:35.558
- David Sandström.
- Hey.

33:37.020 --> 33:40.063
We think your dog passed this virus on
to you and your father.

33:41.784 --> 33:42.694
Boomer?

33:43.686 --> 33:45.640
She was never sick.

33:46.648 --> 33:50.586
- She got hit by a truck and died.
- Well, we talked to your vet.

33:50.706 --> 33:54.135
She said Boomer had 30 stitches in June,
what was that all about?

33:55.842 --> 33:57.003
She...

33:58.051 --> 34:00.500
got into a fight
with something in the woods.

34:01.621 --> 34:03.167
Her face got

34:03.764 --> 34:05.380
bit up pretty bad.

34:06.385 --> 34:09.858
My dad thought it was a wolf maybe.

34:11.803 --> 34:12.672
Why?

34:13.101 --> 34:16.766
Marie, where's Boomer buried?
We're gonna have to exhume the body.

35:13.910 --> 35:14.722
Hey.

35:15.466 --> 35:16.313
Bob.

35:16.841 --> 35:18.119
There's leftovers.

35:18.280 --> 35:19.089
Great.

35:19.989 --> 35:22.300
- Sorry for the mess.
- No problem.

35:22.925 --> 35:25.333
Your email
sounded like the trip was successful.

35:25.453 --> 35:27.078
Maybe. You know how it is.

35:31.498 --> 35:32.508
What about you?

35:33.831 --> 35:35.720
Your hallucinations...

35:36.304 --> 35:38.478
Any improvement with the Imipramine?

35:38.598 --> 35:40.903
You know the woman I was thinking about?

35:41.415 --> 35:44.054
I was heading home from work and...

35:44.748 --> 35:45.955
I smelled...

35:46.188 --> 35:47.190
jasmine...

35:47.516 --> 35:49.556
I think it was <i> Jasminum grandiflorum</i>...

35:49.676 --> 35:51.569
And I looked out across the street...

35:51.730 --> 35:54.197
She was walking along, so beautiful...

35:54.982 --> 35:57.718
I think she saw me, but I wasn't sure.

35:57.838 --> 35:59.319
So I stepped off...

36:02.240 --> 36:03.289
She wasn't there.

36:03.700 --> 36:05.623
Or I couldn't find her and...

36:06.470 --> 36:08.252
Or maybe she was never there...

36:08.412 --> 36:10.647
Bob,
that kind of thing happens to everybody.

36:12.639 --> 36:14.335
I'm fine, David.

36:15.573 --> 36:16.433
Okay.

36:16.712 --> 36:18.163
It's all new to me.

36:18.798 --> 36:19.757
Sure.

36:25.214 --> 36:27.580
You still don't know anything about her?

36:28.706 --> 36:29.995
I can draw her.

36:30.300 --> 36:32.218
I think Da Vinci was wrong.

36:32.502 --> 36:34.182
You can paint what you haven't seen.

36:34.412 --> 36:36.197
I read about this Turkish painter

36:36.357 --> 36:38.076
who was blind all his life.

36:38.196 --> 36:40.701
He painted mounts, and lakes,
and faces and butterflies,

36:40.861 --> 36:42.387
with perspective and shadow

36:42.692 --> 36:45.052
And they tested him in New York

36:45.172 --> 36:48.211
to see how the brain
and other senses construct images.

36:48.504 --> 36:49.629
So maybe...

36:50.965 --> 36:52.505
Maybe that's what you're doing.

36:53.832 --> 36:55.449
Maybe that's what I'm doing.

36:57.488 --> 36:59.434
And this is what she looks like?

37:00.072 --> 37:00.934
Yes.

37:02.115 --> 37:03.203
She's pretty.

37:05.678 --> 37:07.159
I wish I knew who she was.

37:08.389 --> 37:11.779
Well, now you know what she looks like.
That's good. That's great.

37:11.899 --> 37:13.118
We should celebrate.

37:18.041 --> 37:20.796
Imipramine is not a great thing
to mix with alcohol and antibiotics.

37:20.916 --> 37:23.215
Who said one of these is for you?

37:45.325 --> 37:47.852
- Morning.
- Hey, David, wanna take a look?

37:50.676 --> 37:51.522
What is it?

37:51.682 --> 37:54.013
- Communicable dog cancer.
- She had it!

37:54.519 --> 37:56.891
If she had not been hit by the car,
she would have a cancer.

37:57.011 --> 37:58.239
What about the virus?

37:58.778 --> 38:01.962
Rachel said she had two more minutes.
That was half an hour ago.

38:08.195 --> 38:09.165
There you are.

38:10.415 --> 38:12.667
I found the canine CMV in Boomer.

38:12.828 --> 38:14.283
Right in the cancer cells.

38:14.403 --> 38:17.757
There you go! Boomer must have infected
all the other dogs, eh?

38:18.830 --> 38:19.915
What's that?

38:21.283 --> 38:23.054
Cove really was running trials.

38:23.214 --> 38:24.722
Shows excellent results,

38:24.882 --> 38:28.017
for a cocktail
that he uses with a toll receptor drug.

38:28.417 --> 38:29.560
Great news.

38:29.967 --> 38:33.363
The cocktail includes ribavirin,
interferon and a protease inhibitor,

38:33.483 --> 38:37.693
but he does not list the details
of the toll receptor drug.

38:37.853 --> 38:40.112
Don't worry about that.
I'll get it out of him.

38:40.272 --> 38:42.442
- Five minutes in a room with me...
- David.

38:44.517 --> 38:45.743
He's dead.

38:46.430 --> 38:48.326
- Cove is dead.
- What?

38:48.754 --> 38:50.454
Yeah. Some inmates,

38:50.991 --> 38:53.000
where he was in custody...

38:53.976 --> 38:55.800
Mimico or somewhere...

38:56.476 --> 38:59.876
- They heard what he'd done and...
- Aw, fuck.

39:00.771 --> 39:01.926
In the showers...

39:02.450 --> 39:05.676
They apparently needed
his dental records to identify him.

39:07.875 --> 39:09.175
Rachel, I'm sorry.

39:10.475 --> 39:11.976
We were so close.

39:16.776 --> 39:19.277
- You need to take some time here.
- No.

39:19.617 --> 39:20.662
No, I...

39:21.634 --> 39:25.205
We're proving that a dog with cancer
can lick you and give you some disease

39:25.325 --> 39:28.455
that dissolves your brain.
It's really just the kind of...

39:29.130 --> 39:30.871
distraction that I need.

39:33.639 --> 39:35.889
We still have to nail transmission.

39:36.320 --> 39:38.889
How does it get from a cancer cell
on your lip into your brain?

39:39.009 --> 39:40.239
How does it enter?

39:44.248 --> 39:45.094
Mayko!

39:45.379 --> 39:46.595
Stay right there.

39:49.471 --> 39:52.685
I want you to go into the database
on the Iron River patients

39:52.845 --> 39:55.279
and see what their physical condition
was like... I'm looking for

39:55.399 --> 39:57.601
cuts, open sores, cold sores,

39:57.721 --> 39:59.724
chapped lips, cracked lips,
that sort of thing.

39:59.844 --> 40:00.684
Got ya.

40:08.068 --> 40:10.648
How does it get from a cancer cell
on your lip into your brain?

40:10.768 --> 40:12.300
How does it enter?

40:15.826 --> 40:16.645
Mayko!

40:16.994 --> 40:18.210
Stay right there.

40:21.125 --> 40:22.089
I want you to...

40:22.686 --> 40:23.507
Rachel?

40:23.982 --> 40:26.260
You wanted to have a meeting
about the canine CMV?

40:27.257 --> 40:29.407
- Um... yeah.
- You okay?

40:31.797 --> 40:33.184
I need to ask a favour.

40:34.788 --> 40:35.761
Sure.

40:40.205 --> 40:41.352
What's up?

40:45.019 --> 40:47.865
You know this decoy receptor treatment
we're thinking about for Wes?

40:48.350 --> 40:50.029
David's mentioned it.

40:50.592 --> 40:51.882
What do you think?

40:53.839 --> 40:55.664
I'm not a haematologist.

40:55.824 --> 40:57.054
What do you think?

40:59.901 --> 41:01.212
What does Wes say?

41:01.372 --> 41:04.048
Wes wants it.
But David thinks it might be too risky.

41:04.208 --> 41:05.155
It is.

41:06.599 --> 41:07.510
It is.

41:10.560 --> 41:12.431
But if I were Wes, I would do it.

41:13.416 --> 41:14.582
Yeah, me too.

41:20.784 --> 41:23.317
I want you to show me
how to administer the treatment.

41:23.477 --> 41:26.695
And I need to know how to administer
the decoy treatment myself.

41:26.961 --> 41:29.323
- Rachel, listen to me...
- Will you show me

41:29.702 --> 41:30.991
how to do this?

41:32.730 --> 41:36.581
It would take an oversight board
at least 7 days to make a decision.

41:37.743 --> 41:40.117
They'll never want to give you the OK.

41:42.717 --> 41:44.443
So what else can I do?

41:49.167 --> 41:50.010
Yeah.

41:57.469 --> 41:58.364
Thank you.

41:59.972 --> 42:00.867
Good luck.

42:23.662 --> 42:25.079
You're beautiful.

42:30.879 --> 42:31.969
You ready?

42:35.279 --> 42:37.892
You sure you wanna go through with this,
Wes? 'Cause...

42:38.052 --> 42:38.869
Yeah.

42:39.221 --> 42:40.245
Just do it.

42:41.887 --> 42:42.730
Okay.

42:51.913 --> 42:54.213
You understand the risks, right?

42:55.853 --> 42:59.455
And you're sure you understand how these
engineered red blood cells will work.

43:00.139 --> 43:03.500
You've explained it 3 times already,
Rachel.

43:33.601 --> 43:35.783
If it works,
we should see a reduction in viral load

43:35.943 --> 43:37.370
in about 4 hours.

43:39.544 --> 43:40.363
So?

43:40.614 --> 43:43.916
Well, of the original 9 patients
in Iron River,

43:46.280 --> 43:47.545
3 had minor abrasions,

43:47.705 --> 43:50.155
2 had chronic herpes mouth sores,

43:50.275 --> 43:52.388
- and 4 worked outside.
- That works for me.

43:52.508 --> 43:55.478
Working outdoors causes cracked lips.
Everybody else had open wounds.

43:55.598 --> 43:59.455
- Where are you going with this?
- Cancer cells replicate like crazy,

43:59.575 --> 44:02.550
and dogs pass them one to another.
CMV is a hitchhiker.

44:03.031 --> 44:06.476
It crawls into the cancer cells and lets
it do all the work for it: replication.

44:06.596 --> 44:09.780
And then the dogs transmit it
from one to the other,

44:09.900 --> 44:13.257
- dog goes to lick somebody...
- Virus crawls out of the cancer cell

44:13.377 --> 44:15.835
into an open cut
and enters into the body...

44:16.071 --> 44:17.618
And then you die.

44:18.861 --> 44:21.766
So, is this a freak occurrence
in Iron River?

44:21.886 --> 44:23.872
Like,
should I stop making out with dogs?

44:24.672 --> 44:27.001
Dunno. We'd have to find
a really smart post-doc

44:27.161 --> 44:29.169
to spend the next 5 years
helping us figure it out.

44:29.704 --> 44:31.391
What about the PML patients?

44:31.511 --> 44:34.174
Antivirals can stop the infection;
the problem is,

44:34.334 --> 44:37.699
when you realize somebody's got it,
damage to the brain has already happened

44:37.819 --> 44:39.401
and can't be undone.

44:55.672 --> 44:57.239
When all this is over,

44:58.233 --> 45:02.654
I'm renting us a room at the
Four Seasons in Papagayo, Costa Rica.

45:06.000 --> 45:07.664
Just the two of us.

45:16.539 --> 45:17.509
Common Wes!

45:17.670 --> 45:19.178
Help! I need somebody in here!

45:19.339 --> 45:20.662
He's not breathing!

45:20.782 --> 45:22.431
Take it easy. It's okay.

45:23.299 --> 45:24.910
I need someone now!

45:27.074 --> 45:30.043
Take it easy. Take it easy. Just relax.

45:30.913 --> 45:34.075
Did you read this?
The girl poisoned in Ottawa?

45:34.195 --> 45:36.445
She's the daughter
of city council Randall Oberman.

45:36.605 --> 45:38.739
He's trying to stop
the construction of a mosque.

45:38.899 --> 45:42.269
- It's got the Muslim all over him.
- He thinks they poisoned his daughter?

45:42.389 --> 45:44.870
Some boys, Arabs, Muslim kids,

45:45.030 --> 45:47.706
have been taunting her at school
and defaced her locker.

45:48.233 --> 45:49.171
If she dies...

45:49.291 --> 45:51.947
Homeland Security commissioned
3 biotechnology companies

45:52.067 --> 45:54.463
to come up with a cure
in case of a smallpox attack.

45:54.583 --> 45:56.757
Homeland wants NorBAC's opinion
on which drug to use.

45:56.877 --> 45:58.245
Is it contagious, Captain?

45:58.365 --> 46:00.636
Should the military stop
the inoculation program?

46:00.756 --> 46:02.346
No, it's not contagious.

46:02.507 --> 46:03.339
Not true.

46:03.459 --> 46:06.850
Marianne caught it from her husband,
so technically it is contagious.

46:07.088 --> 46:08.998
A kiss... did this?

46:09.118 --> 46:11.814
You better look at it fast.
They may have called us too late.

46:12.696 --> 46:14.233
He doesn't have months.

46:14.394 --> 46:16.610
We'll make him as comfortable as we can.

46:17.527 --> 46:18.816
You're a mess.

46:21.722 --> 46:23.909
I know you're not gonna give up on me.

46:24.276 --> 46:26.062
I don't think he's gonna make it.

46:28.148 --> 46:29.540
We'll think of something.

46:30.305 --> 46:36.897
