WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:03.003
(clock ticking)

00:17.385 --> 00:19.987
So, Gretchen,

00:20.020 --> 00:21.889
there's a topic
we haven't broached yet.

00:21.922 --> 00:24.125
How you seem to only own
one pair of jeans?

00:25.226 --> 00:27.395
You've been so focused
on Jimmy's dad.

00:27.428 --> 00:29.730
Has that stirred up any feelings
about your father?

00:31.732 --> 00:32.700
Nope!

00:32.733 --> 00:34.168
What about your mom?

00:34.202 --> 00:36.036
I've noticed some tension
around the subject.

00:36.070 --> 00:37.505
Tension?

00:37.538 --> 00:39.373
My mom's a baller-ass boss.
End of story.

00:39.407 --> 00:41.075
(gasps)
Did you see Wheel last night?

00:41.109 --> 00:43.844
Someone almost hit
the million-dollar wedge.

00:43.877 --> 00:45.446
I remember when they
brought that out in '08,

00:45.479 --> 00:48.716
I was like,
"What? That is nuts."

00:48.749 --> 00:51.352
So, would you say she's
controlling, manipulative?

00:51.385 --> 00:53.020
If I biffed a tennis match,

00:53.053 --> 00:55.089
she would take away
my sheets and pillows.

00:55.123 --> 00:56.624
But that is what made me strong.

00:56.657 --> 00:58.959
My friends had chill parents
who didn't push them,

00:58.992 --> 01:00.928
and now they're all
unmotivated babies.

01:00.961 --> 01:03.131
Maybe if they had a mom
like mine,

01:03.164 --> 01:05.866
they wouldn't be the pieces
of shit that they are currently.

01:05.899 --> 01:08.035
You know what?

01:08.068 --> 01:11.239
I'm gonna fix those shitty
babies, just like my mom would.

01:11.272 --> 01:12.606
I would actually advise you
not interfere

01:12.640 --> 01:13.607
with your friends' lives,

01:13.641 --> 01:14.942
Too late. Doing it.

01:14.975 --> 01:16.377
Of course you are.

01:16.410 --> 01:18.446
(sniffs) Okay, Gretchen.

01:18.479 --> 01:20.914
(clears throat)
This is obviously not working.

01:20.948 --> 01:22.916
The defensiveness,
the mid-session naps,

01:22.950 --> 01:24.752
the things you're writing
on the bathroom stalls,

01:24.785 --> 01:25.819
the name-calling...

01:25.853 --> 01:27.087
Oh, see, that one's on you.

01:27.121 --> 01:28.889
You let a dog on the bed once...

01:28.922 --> 01:30.057
No one is forcing you
to be here.

01:30.090 --> 01:32.426
Are you firing me?

01:32.460 --> 01:34.027
You don't fire me. I fire you.

01:37.531 --> 01:39.133
Okay.

01:39.167 --> 01:40.434
(scoffs softly) Wait.

01:40.468 --> 01:42.470
Uh, let's compromise. Uh...

01:42.503 --> 01:45.573
if I fix my friends and prove
that I'm right about my mom,

01:45.606 --> 01:48.809
do you promise not to fire me?

01:48.842 --> 01:50.077
I'm not firing you.

01:50.110 --> 01:51.579
That is not a compromise.

01:51.612 --> 01:53.080
And I don't agree to any of it.

01:53.113 --> 01:54.615
Great. Deal.

01:55.649 --> 01:56.784
Seriously,

01:56.817 --> 01:59.353
jeans are, like,
20 bucks at H&M.

01:59.387 --> 02:01.121
Get on it.

02:07.127 --> 02:09.930
* I'm gonna leave you anyway

02:09.963 --> 02:12.666
* I'm gonna leave you
anyway *

02:12.700 --> 02:16.003
* Gonna leave you anyway.

02:19.873 --> 02:21.875
(video game sound effects)

02:24.378 --> 02:25.813
(elephant trumpets)

02:27.348 --> 02:29.116
What are you doing?

02:29.149 --> 02:31.051
Zoo Entrepreneur?
What the hell is this?

02:31.084 --> 02:32.553
It's a highly invigorating game

02:32.586 --> 02:34.788
in which one builds
a virtual zoo.

02:34.822 --> 02:38.058
Mine's called "Jimmy's
Spectacular Zoo of Wonder

02:38.091 --> 02:39.527
"and Animal Friends

02:39.560 --> 02:43.063
Plus Cinnabons,
Parenthesis No Edgars Allowed."

02:43.096 --> 02:44.665
And you're
a professional writer.

02:44.698 --> 02:47.868
Gretchen, feeding the giraffe
and washing the rhinoceri

02:47.901 --> 02:49.870
exercises everything
that a writer needs

02:49.903 --> 02:51.339
for a productive day:

02:51.372 --> 02:54.808
problem solving, imagination,
word having.

02:54.842 --> 02:55.909
What's your giraffe's name?

02:55.943 --> 02:57.578
Necky.

02:57.611 --> 02:59.413
Jimmy, you have a deadline!
You need to be writing!

02:59.447 --> 03:01.349
Gretchen, it's
all writing!

03:01.382 --> 03:02.716
No, it's not.

03:02.750 --> 03:04.552
Playing, literally,
the world's most boring game

03:04.585 --> 03:05.586
is not writing.
(gasps)

03:05.619 --> 03:07.388
You know what's writing?
(gasps)

03:07.421 --> 03:08.656
Writing!

03:08.689 --> 03:09.890
Sorry, bor-- boring?

03:09.923 --> 03:11.659
Why, just yesterday
a seven-year-old

03:11.692 --> 03:13.427
fell into the
koala enclosure.

03:13.461 --> 03:14.728
He was not injured.

03:14.762 --> 03:17.498
But he sure was
severely nuzzled.

03:17.531 --> 03:18.566
Gretchen, what
are you-- No!

03:18.599 --> 03:19.767
No, plug the
router back in!

03:19.800 --> 03:20.901
My zoo is cloud-based.

03:20.934 --> 03:22.336
You show me some progress
on your book,

03:22.370 --> 03:23.871
and maybe you'll
get this back.

03:23.904 --> 03:27.675
Uh, my female elephant
has severe ADHD.

03:27.708 --> 03:29.677
If I don't provide her
with constant stimuli,

03:29.710 --> 03:31.545
she'll suck all the hair
off her tail.

03:31.579 --> 03:32.846
What's your elephant's name?

03:32.880 --> 03:34.214
Persephone Cordelia Fitzsimmons.

03:35.148 --> 03:36.417
Trunky.

03:38.819 --> 03:41.689
(sighs)

03:41.722 --> 03:43.190
(moaning):
Oh, yes.

03:43.223 --> 03:45.092
Oh, that's so good.

03:45.125 --> 03:46.360
Do it.

03:46.394 --> 03:48.462
PAUL: Ooh, would you
look at that?

03:48.496 --> 03:50.898
A new pokÃ© place just
opened up on Barrington.

03:52.633 --> 03:55.035
Actor Peter Gallagher

03:55.068 --> 03:58.806
has shaved $100,000
off the listing for his home,

03:58.839 --> 04:01.609
which features mature
fruit trees.

04:01.642 --> 04:02.876
Imagine that.

04:02.910 --> 04:04.244
(panting, moaning)
Oh.

04:04.278 --> 04:06.647
The bulky item drop-off event
is next weekend.

04:06.680 --> 04:09.483
We could dispose of
the broken wine fridge.

04:09.517 --> 04:10.718
Pull my hair.

04:10.751 --> 04:11.785
What?

04:11.819 --> 04:13.721
Another iOS update?

04:13.754 --> 04:15.623
These things are quite
the nuisance, but...

04:15.656 --> 04:17.591
Choke me.
...necessary for stability.

04:17.625 --> 04:19.827
Almost there.
Oh, my God, Lindsay.

04:19.860 --> 04:22.763
Did you know that every time
you evacuate your bowels,

04:22.796 --> 04:24.231
you lose one-third...
Almost there!

04:24.264 --> 04:26.500
...of the bacteria...
I'm almost there!

04:26.534 --> 04:27.801
...in your body.

04:27.835 --> 04:29.637
Goddamn it!

04:29.670 --> 04:32.139
Isn't that amazing?
(chuckles)

04:32.172 --> 04:34.642
Oh. Huh.

04:34.675 --> 04:36.910
KILLIAN: "Simon startled,
pulsing with desire,

04:36.944 --> 04:38.346
"for he had dreamed
of Kitty again.

04:38.379 --> 04:39.913
"He wondered if at that moment,

04:39.947 --> 04:42.282
she was dreaming of him,
moist and..."

04:42.316 --> 04:45.953
This is the worst day for me
to be absent from the zoo.

04:45.986 --> 04:48.822
I didn't order extra pellets
for the petting zoo.

04:48.856 --> 04:50.358
There's no way that those goats

04:50.391 --> 04:52.526
don't develop a taste
for human fingers.

04:52.560 --> 04:54.294
Can't do this today.

04:54.328 --> 04:56.330
You promised your agent two more
chapters by the end of the week.

04:56.364 --> 04:59.967
Well, we all make promises
we can't keep, Killian.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.703
(door opens)
Like you, with your
Presidential Fitness Challenge.

05:02.736 --> 05:04.304
(door closes)

05:10.644 --> 05:12.446
Uh, are you okay?

05:12.480 --> 05:14.948
Ever since my dad's roast,
I've felt odd.

05:14.982 --> 05:18.719
Just aimless,
but suddenly awakened.

05:18.752 --> 05:20.821
Like I'm accessing
areas of my brain

05:20.854 --> 05:22.690
that have been shut off
for years.

05:22.723 --> 05:25.793
I feel like Bradley Cooper,
you know, in that movie, uh...

05:25.826 --> 05:26.760
Aloha.
...Limitless.

05:28.596 --> 05:30.564
What is that body of water
down there?

05:30.598 --> 05:34.067
Is it some sort of public wash
for the destitute?

05:34.101 --> 05:35.669
Have you seriously never been
to the reservoir?

05:35.703 --> 05:37.571
There's a park,
a running trail,

05:37.605 --> 05:38.572
a rec center.

05:38.606 --> 05:40.474
Well, that settles that.

05:40.508 --> 05:42.309
To the...

05:42.342 --> 05:44.512
reservoir I shall go.

05:44.545 --> 05:46.013
I'd go with you,

05:46.046 --> 05:49.016
but I'm actually working on
a new Dr. Weed video.

05:49.049 --> 05:50.518
(door closes)
Did I ever tell you

05:50.551 --> 05:52.319
about my character, Dr. Weed?

05:52.352 --> 05:55.689
He's this doctor
who loves weed, but...

05:55.723 --> 05:58.091
Mister?

05:58.125 --> 05:59.860
Do you have any extra foods?

06:00.894 --> 06:02.295
Oh.

06:15.443 --> 06:16.777
Lindsay, you're a mess, right?

06:16.810 --> 06:18.712
Boy howdy.

06:18.746 --> 06:21.248
So, what is going on
in your life

06:21.281 --> 06:23.116
that I can berate you
into fixing my way?

06:23.150 --> 06:25.553
Hmm. Let's see.

06:25.586 --> 06:29.022
Well, I was having sex
with this hunk

06:29.056 --> 06:31.892
named Raul,
and I was about to splooge,

06:31.925 --> 06:34.695
but then Paul kept talking
and it went back inside.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.430
(chuckles): I still can't
believe you're cucking Paul.

06:36.464 --> 06:38.131
I'm what now?
Cuckolding.

06:38.165 --> 06:39.733
It's a subgenre of femdom.

06:39.767 --> 06:41.802
Well, whatever it is,
Paul's ruining it.

06:41.835 --> 06:44.104
I just want to be normal
and cheat on my husband

06:44.137 --> 06:45.706
without feeling guilty about it.

06:45.739 --> 06:48.208
And here you are
sulking about it like a loser.

06:48.241 --> 06:49.777
You know what winners do?

06:49.810 --> 06:51.779
They take what they want,
no matter what.

06:51.812 --> 06:53.413
So what are you gonna do
about it?

06:54.448 --> 06:56.283
I'm gonna...

06:56.316 --> 06:59.953
tell Paul to go away the next
time I want to pork a rando?

06:59.987 --> 07:01.822
And don't you come back
without results, young lady,

07:01.855 --> 07:03.457
or else no Must See TV for you!

07:03.491 --> 07:04.725
Why are you being so bossy?

07:04.758 --> 07:06.660
Not bossy, Lindsay.

07:07.695 --> 07:09.663
Maternal.

07:09.697 --> 07:10.498
(gasps)

07:10.531 --> 07:12.966
* I want to drive

07:13.000 --> 07:15.903
* Elsewhere in the place

07:15.936 --> 07:19.006
* In the dead of night

07:19.039 --> 07:23.410
* I want to see what makes

07:23.443 --> 07:25.846
* I want to see

07:25.879 --> 07:28.849
* Rusty cities
(barking)

07:28.882 --> 07:31.151
* Watch them fall

07:31.184 --> 07:35.288
* I want to see it all

07:35.322 --> 07:37.958
* I want to know

07:37.991 --> 07:40.460
* That there ain't no cure...

07:40.494 --> 07:43.130
You retrieved the projectile.

07:44.397 --> 07:46.700
But why?

07:47.701 --> 07:49.770
* I know
* I know *

07:49.803 --> 07:51.304
* There's something missing

07:51.338 --> 07:52.706
* I know
* I know *

07:52.740 --> 07:53.807
* There's something missing

07:53.841 --> 07:56.677
* I know
* I know *

07:56.710 --> 07:59.613
* It's all right.

07:59.647 --> 08:02.049
(howling)

08:02.082 --> 08:03.316
(howling)

08:03.350 --> 08:06.486
Do you guys watch Mr. Robot?

08:08.522 --> 08:09.890
(East L.A. accent):
Okay. Our first letter

08:09.923 --> 08:11.491
comes from Randall in Lubbock.

08:11.525 --> 08:12.960
(Southern accent):
"Dear Dr. Weed...
(door closes)

08:12.993 --> 08:15.729
"...every soap I
use in the shower

08:15.763 --> 08:17.364
dries my skin out."

08:17.397 --> 08:19.733
(East L.A. accent): Randall,
this is a very common problem.

08:19.767 --> 08:24.304
My diagnosis is:
twice a day, I want you...

08:24.337 --> 08:29.643
to smoke more weed...!

08:29.677 --> 08:31.344
What's going on here?

08:31.378 --> 08:33.714
(normal voice):
Uh, cut.

08:33.747 --> 08:35.649
Uh, just answering

08:35.683 --> 08:38.151
viewer mail.

08:38.185 --> 08:39.887
I-I write the questions myself.

08:40.954 --> 08:42.590
So what's the goal with this?

08:42.623 --> 08:44.024
Oh, nothing.
It's just something dumb

08:44.057 --> 08:45.593
I put on the Internet
for my vet friends.

08:45.626 --> 08:48.261
So you're wasting
your most valuable resource...

08:48.295 --> 08:50.564
My talent?
...your time, for no reason.

08:50.598 --> 08:52.432
Edgar, this has potential.

08:52.465 --> 08:54.101
Really? Thanks.

08:54.134 --> 08:56.069
Because, you know, I thought...
But just because you got

08:56.103 --> 08:57.638
your period at 11
does not make you a woman.

08:59.640 --> 09:01.008
Look, if you're gonna do
these videos,

09:01.041 --> 09:02.542
you got to do them all the way.

09:02.576 --> 09:04.177
(stammers)

09:04.211 --> 09:05.579
Okay.

09:05.613 --> 09:08.381
First, we're gonna
blast the video sites

09:08.415 --> 09:09.917
and anything
veteran related.
Mm-hmm.

09:09.950 --> 09:11.619
I'll sneak it to some contacts.

09:11.652 --> 09:12.920
Hey!

09:12.953 --> 09:15.255
You have a comment
from a journalist.

09:15.288 --> 09:18.558
"I'm producing a new piece on
how marijuana can help veterans,

09:18.592 --> 09:19.960
and I'd love to interview you."

09:19.993 --> 09:21.528
So have you reached out to him?

09:21.561 --> 09:23.764
Nah. I don't really want
that much attention.

09:27.400 --> 09:30.370
What's wrong?

09:30.403 --> 09:31.939
Are you mad at me?

09:31.972 --> 09:34.441
Sometimes I think I care
more about this than you do.

09:34.474 --> 09:36.243
No, no. I'm-I'm sorry.

09:36.276 --> 09:37.911
I was just nervous.
I'll e-mail the guy.

09:37.945 --> 09:39.446
Hey, hey.

09:44.317 --> 09:46.620
Is that the shirt
you're wearing?

09:46.654 --> 09:48.656
Hmm.

09:51.458 --> 09:54.828
(kids chattering playfully)

09:54.862 --> 09:56.830
(men chattering,
basketball bouncing)

09:56.864 --> 09:58.398
MAN:
Oh, yeah.

09:58.431 --> 09:59.767
Shoot it, shoot it,
shoot it, shoot it.

09:59.800 --> 10:01.501
Go in, go in,
go in, go in!

10:01.534 --> 10:04.104
Yeah!
JIMMY: Yay!

10:05.839 --> 10:07.641
Let's go.
Let's run next.

10:07.675 --> 10:09.276
You want in?

10:11.311 --> 10:14.114
Well, I am trying
new things today.

10:14.147 --> 10:15.415
I am in.

10:15.448 --> 10:17.450
Whose, uh... whose squad
shall I be on?

10:17.484 --> 10:18.986
The other one.

10:19.519 --> 10:20.453
Screen, screen, screen.

10:20.487 --> 10:22.455
*

10:27.527 --> 10:29.062
Hey, hey, hey!
You, you, you!

10:30.798 --> 10:32.833
*

10:35.035 --> 10:36.169
Watch screen, screen!
Yeah!

10:37.137 --> 10:38.706
Shoot it!

10:40.407 --> 10:41.441
Yes!

10:41.474 --> 10:43.443
I win! I win.

10:43.476 --> 10:44.611
(panting)

10:44.644 --> 10:46.613
What an invigorating hand sport.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.716
How often do you, uh,
you fellows play?

10:50.483 --> 10:51.985
(Jimmy screams)

10:52.019 --> 10:53.153
Ow, my ankle!

10:53.186 --> 10:54.221
W-We forfeit!

10:54.254 --> 10:55.789
My-my team forfeits!

10:55.823 --> 10:57.324
(groaning)

10:58.358 --> 11:00.761
Nice and clean.

11:06.266 --> 11:07.835
(shudders)

11:07.868 --> 11:09.102
So clean.

11:10.871 --> 11:11.839
(clears throat)

11:11.872 --> 11:12.873
Hey.

11:12.906 --> 11:14.374
Bear, can we talk?

11:14.407 --> 11:15.408
Of course.

11:18.378 --> 11:20.848
I love you so much.

11:20.881 --> 11:23.050
And I want to keep
being honest with you.

11:23.083 --> 11:25.018
Oh, God.
I just noticed how hard

11:25.052 --> 11:27.587
it's been for you
when Raul is around.

11:27.620 --> 11:32.559
So, for your sake, I'll spend
time with him, or whoever,

11:32.592 --> 11:35.896
somewhere else,
so you won't have to watch.

11:35.929 --> 11:36.930
For you.

11:39.432 --> 11:43.336
You can't have relations with
other men when I'm not there.

11:43.370 --> 11:44.838
That's adultery.

11:44.872 --> 11:47.674
Well, you're clearly not
enjoying cucking.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.042
Which is what we're doing.

11:49.076 --> 11:50.677
And it's ruining it for me.

11:50.710 --> 11:54.047
I am doing the hard work
to be a better partner

11:54.081 --> 11:55.415
and tell you
what I need.

11:55.448 --> 11:58.919
And if you can't
handle it...

11:58.952 --> 12:01.922
I just don't know, Paul.

12:01.955 --> 12:03.824
I just don't know.

12:04.892 --> 12:07.594
So...

12:07.627 --> 12:10.297
this cucking is something
many women fantasize about?

12:10.330 --> 12:12.565
All of them. They all do.

12:14.601 --> 12:16.603
(sighs)

12:19.807 --> 12:23.911
Boy. Now I'm embarrassed
by my prudishness.

12:24.945 --> 12:27.580
Well, if this is an established,

12:27.614 --> 12:29.482
rudimentary fetish,
then I suppose

12:29.516 --> 12:30.918
I am up for the challenge.

12:30.951 --> 12:33.586
I'm going to research
this fantasy of yours.

12:33.620 --> 12:35.055
You'll see.

12:35.088 --> 12:38.725
I'll be the best cuck ever.

12:38.758 --> 12:40.360
For our family.

12:42.429 --> 12:43.696
Family.

12:52.005 --> 12:54.774
(groans)
Are you sure it's not broken?

12:54.808 --> 12:56.409
It's just a sprain.
So what happened?

12:56.443 --> 12:59.246
(sighs)
I was hooping "b-ball"

12:59.279 --> 13:00.981
with some diverse
local athletes.

13:01.014 --> 13:02.282
Sick.

13:02.315 --> 13:04.284
I am so stoked
you called me for this.

13:04.317 --> 13:06.987
Well, don't have
insurance, so...

13:07.020 --> 13:07.988
Anyway, thanks.

13:08.021 --> 13:09.489
Uh-uh. We made a deal.

13:09.522 --> 13:11.791
I'm not doing your podcast.
You promised!

13:11.825 --> 13:14.828
I don't care. I'm not...

13:14.862 --> 13:18.165
Although, before yesterday,
I thought I hated dogs,

13:18.198 --> 13:22.335
sports, hipster picnics and
unrefrigerated cart fruit, too.

13:22.369 --> 13:24.204
Do you know what?
I will do it.

13:24.237 --> 13:26.106
Hell yeah! This is gonna be
the best episode

13:26.139 --> 13:28.641
since Adam Pally did
that extended bit

13:28.675 --> 13:30.177
where he pretended he was pissed

13:30.210 --> 13:32.980
and didn't know why
he was doing my show.

13:33.013 --> 13:34.982
You're slouching.

13:35.015 --> 13:37.650
Okay, almost ready.

13:37.684 --> 13:39.019
Okay.
Good.

13:39.052 --> 13:40.787
Edgar, tell the nice man
what we talked about.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.622
(whispers):
What's the blue screen for?

13:42.655 --> 13:45.058
Edgar. You can ask him.

13:47.861 --> 13:49.296
What's the blue screen for?

13:49.329 --> 13:52.665
Oh, uh, we have a
really cool digital set

13:52.699 --> 13:55.468
that we composite
in, like Tosh.0.

13:55.502 --> 13:56.469
And this card?

13:56.503 --> 13:57.570
White balance.

13:59.339 --> 14:00.773
(whispers):
White balance.

14:03.576 --> 14:06.546
Just bring it up a
little bit. Good.

14:07.915 --> 14:08.848
Okay.

14:09.950 --> 14:11.851
So, can you
introduce yourself?

14:11.885 --> 14:14.387
Well, my name is Edgar Quintero.

14:14.421 --> 14:16.223
6th Battalion, 8th Infantry.

14:16.256 --> 14:18.758
And what's your experience
with the V.A. been like?

14:18.791 --> 14:21.194
The V.A. is a great institution,

14:21.228 --> 14:24.431
but they're underfunded
and understaffed.

14:24.464 --> 14:26.499
People are literally dying

14:26.533 --> 14:28.568
because they can't get
the health care they need.

14:28.601 --> 14:30.203
And how long
have you been

14:30.237 --> 14:31.838
treating your PTSD
with marijuana?

14:31.871 --> 14:34.107
Oh, um, th...

14:34.141 --> 14:35.542
that wasn't...

14:35.575 --> 14:37.044
that's not really...

14:39.712 --> 14:41.581
I'm just
not comfortable being

14:41.614 --> 14:43.850
so open about
my self-medicating.

14:43.883 --> 14:46.686
Plus, this is all
a lot fancier than I expected.

14:46.719 --> 14:49.189
They got a blue screen
like Tosh.0.

14:49.222 --> 14:52.125
Honey... you're doing great.

14:52.159 --> 14:55.262
Now, if you don't
get back out there,

14:55.295 --> 14:57.330
we are not stopping for
milkshakes on the way home.

15:05.405 --> 15:07.774
(exhales)

15:07.807 --> 15:10.777
I have tried
a bunch of treatments,

15:10.810 --> 15:13.413
but nothing has fixed my PTSD.

15:15.415 --> 15:19.619
Lately though, I found that s...

15:19.652 --> 15:21.921
smoking pot has been
really effective.

15:23.923 --> 15:26.793
I even kind of feel like
a real person again.

15:29.429 --> 15:31.664
I don't know if marijuana
works for everyone,

15:31.698 --> 15:35.368
but it seems to be
working for me.

15:40.107 --> 15:41.641
(TV playing quietly)

15:44.277 --> 15:45.412
Is it bedtime?

15:45.445 --> 15:47.114
It's still day.

15:47.147 --> 15:48.948
Bedtime's for night.

15:48.982 --> 15:51.751
As promised, wife,
I've been researching

15:51.784 --> 15:53.186
this cuckolding fetish
we now have.

15:53.220 --> 15:54.321
Oh?

15:54.354 --> 15:55.588
Certain men intuit

15:55.622 --> 15:58.791
that they are genetically
inferior beta males.

15:58.825 --> 16:02.996
So they get aroused by watching
their partners copulate

16:03.030 --> 16:07.434
with someone of superior DNA,
e.g. Raul.

16:07.467 --> 16:12.105
Furthermore, I have a special
present for you, my hot wife.

16:12.139 --> 16:15.442
(giggles)
Where's my present?

16:15.475 --> 16:17.577
Right here.

16:20.347 --> 16:25.185
The cage symbolizes the cuck's
sexual inferiority

16:25.218 --> 16:27.154
and genital unworthiness.

16:27.187 --> 16:30.790
By associating
sexual arousal with...

16:30.823 --> 16:32.359
(strained):
extreme pain,

16:32.392 --> 16:35.962
my body will slowly learn
that I do not deserve

16:35.995 --> 16:38.831
erotic satisfaction.
(cage locks)

16:41.000 --> 16:42.302
Oh, God.

16:42.335 --> 16:44.871
Okay, Paul...
(knock on door)

16:48.908 --> 16:51.611
Part deux of my surprise.
(chuckles)

16:52.879 --> 16:54.547
Raul.

16:54.581 --> 16:56.083
Raul's friend.

16:56.116 --> 16:57.817
Good day.

16:57.850 --> 17:00.420
You may take
what you want.

17:03.022 --> 17:05.024
*

17:08.795 --> 17:10.197
Oh, boy.

17:10.230 --> 17:11.864
This is humiliating.

17:11.898 --> 17:15.902
Your genetic superiority
is extremely emasculating.

17:15.935 --> 17:18.271
Oh, boy,
that's my wife.

17:18.305 --> 17:19.706
I'm a worm.

17:19.739 --> 17:20.940
I'm a worm.

17:20.973 --> 17:21.941
That's my wife!

17:21.974 --> 17:24.043
I'm a worm!
Oh, oh.

17:24.077 --> 17:25.212
The cage!

17:25.245 --> 17:27.046
Oh, the cage.

17:29.249 --> 17:31.084
I was not expecting this.

17:31.118 --> 17:33.753
Dude, I have, like,
20,000 subscribers.

17:33.786 --> 17:35.422
Vernon, the
guest shower is

17:35.455 --> 17:37.224
completely clogged
by your curly hair.

17:37.257 --> 17:39.192
I swear to God, if you're not
taking your Propecia--

17:39.226 --> 17:41.361
Hi, Jimmy.
Let's test your levels, huh?

17:41.394 --> 17:43.029
You're on the podcast?

17:43.062 --> 17:44.297
Don't sound so shocked.

17:44.331 --> 17:46.099
I interned for Frosty,
Heidi and Frank.

17:46.133 --> 17:48.601
(harmonica plays)
ANNOUNCER:
This is Balloon Knot Media.

17:48.635 --> 17:50.170
(fart sound)

17:52.739 --> 17:55.375
Welcome to Vernon Down the House
on Balloon Knot Media.

17:55.408 --> 17:58.211
I am Dr. Vernon Barbara,
joined, as always,

17:58.245 --> 18:00.079
by my lovely wife
and sidekick...

18:00.113 --> 18:01.448
Uh, cohost.

18:01.481 --> 18:04.251
Hey, Bec.
Aw, did I say "sidekick" again?

18:04.284 --> 18:07.920
Hey, Vern. Uh, yeah, you did,
you stinker. (chuckles)

18:07.954 --> 18:09.556
VERNON: Visiting the
man cave this week

18:09.589 --> 18:11.924
is a very special guest;
he's a best-selling author,

18:11.958 --> 18:14.727
and one of my all-time
best buds,

18:14.761 --> 18:16.496
Jimmy Shive-Overly.
(canned applause)

18:16.529 --> 18:18.265
Welcome, Jimmy.

18:18.298 --> 18:19.499
Uh, thank you.

18:19.532 --> 18:21.601
So great.
So, Jimmy, where you from?

18:21.634 --> 18:23.002
Savannah, Georgia.

18:23.035 --> 18:24.637
(both laugh loudly)

18:24.671 --> 18:26.439
That's great.

18:26.473 --> 18:29.809
Uh, I'm actually from a
small town outside Manchester.

18:29.842 --> 18:31.077
England.

18:31.110 --> 18:33.180
Oh, Jimmy,
you are just too much.

18:33.213 --> 18:34.647
Ah, that is great stuff.

18:34.681 --> 18:37.350
So, Jimmy, are you in
a good place right now?

18:38.485 --> 18:39.819
Yes.

18:39.852 --> 18:41.488
Even with the recent death
of your father?

18:41.521 --> 18:42.489
BECCA:
Oh, yeah.

18:42.522 --> 18:44.824
It gets real in the man cave.

18:44.857 --> 18:46.326
He made Adam Pally cry.

18:46.359 --> 18:48.094
That guy's got some stuff.

18:48.127 --> 18:49.862
(brief dramatic music)
WOMAN (echoes): Dra-ma!

18:49.896 --> 18:54.467
Um... well, we had a
memorial service the other day.

18:54.501 --> 18:56.836
That helped me
get some closure.

18:56.869 --> 18:58.338
And why was closure important?

18:58.371 --> 19:00.840
(ticking clock sound)

19:00.873 --> 19:03.343
(ticking stops)
Well, I guess my
role in the family

19:03.376 --> 19:06.446
was basically to
annoy him, so...

19:06.479 --> 19:08.114
So you could get the attention
you wouldn't otherwise get.

19:08.147 --> 19:09.616
Is that why
you moved to L.A.,

19:09.649 --> 19:11.384
became a writer?
BECCA: Had your nipple pierced

19:11.418 --> 19:13.786
for two weeks, or fostered
that boa constrictor?

19:13.820 --> 19:15.188
Aw, Squeezy.

19:15.222 --> 19:17.524
Sounds like quite the weight
has been lifted off you, then.

19:17.557 --> 19:19.859
Yeah.

19:19.892 --> 19:21.728
Guess it sort of has.

19:21.761 --> 19:23.696
So, what's next for Jimmy?

19:26.666 --> 19:28.668
I've been working
on my new book.

19:28.701 --> 19:29.969
Although, to be honest,

19:30.002 --> 19:32.205
I haven't been getting
much writing done lately.

19:32.239 --> 19:36.175
But I thought you only became
a writer to piss off your dad.

19:36.209 --> 19:39.145
Yes, I did become a
writer to make him angry.

19:39.178 --> 19:41.548
So, if he's gone, why are you
still living your life

19:41.581 --> 19:42.649
in reaction to him?

19:42.682 --> 19:44.817
So, if I'm not writing,

19:44.851 --> 19:47.720
because I have no one to
write against anymore...

19:49.556 --> 19:51.558
...who am I?

19:51.591 --> 19:53.192
That's what I'm saying.
That's what he's saying.

19:53.226 --> 19:55.161
(harp plays a scale)
VOICES: Insight.

19:55.194 --> 19:57.230
I can start over now.

19:57.264 --> 19:59.399
Not in reaction to anyone,

19:59.432 --> 20:01.834
but in accordance
to my authentic self,

20:01.868 --> 20:04.036
whomever I was meant to be!

20:04.070 --> 20:06.038
(chuckles):
Oh, my God!

20:06.072 --> 20:08.841
What if what I was actually
meant to do is...

20:08.875 --> 20:11.578
I'm gonna stop you right there.
Got to pay some bills. Bec?

20:11.611 --> 20:13.613
(guitar music plays)
This week's
Vernon Down the House

20:13.646 --> 20:16.716
is exclusively sponsored
by Red Napkin.

20:16.749 --> 20:20.052
Guys, I love Red Napkin,
for so many reasons.

20:20.086 --> 20:21.888
(fading): You know how sometimes
you want a za'atar-spiced

20:21.921 --> 20:25.057
fennel stromboli, but you don't
want to leave the house?

20:34.166 --> 20:35.702
Hey, hon, you hungry?

20:35.735 --> 20:37.437
Don't "hon" me!

20:37.470 --> 20:39.138
Look at what you did.

20:39.171 --> 20:42.208
Those numbers don't lie!

20:42.241 --> 20:44.210
You know what else doesn't lie?

20:44.243 --> 20:45.912
War heroes!

20:45.945 --> 20:49.582
My name is Edgar Quintero,
6th Battalion, 8th Infantry.

20:49.616 --> 20:52.485
Smoking pot fixed my PTSD.

20:52.519 --> 20:55.455
The V.A.... expects all of us...
to shut the hell up.

20:55.488 --> 20:57.624
Marijuana works for everyone.

20:57.657 --> 20:59.726
People are literally dying

20:59.759 --> 21:01.394
because they can't
get marijuana.

21:01.428 --> 21:03.430
People literally... dying.

21:03.463 --> 21:05.665
They're... dying.
People... are dying.

21:05.698 --> 21:07.133
(militaristic rock music plays)

21:09.135 --> 21:10.337
(TV turns off)

21:10.370 --> 21:13.105
You got me in with
the pot people.

21:13.139 --> 21:14.807
They're the worst people.

21:14.841 --> 21:17.777
Worse than people who study
abroad or atheists or...

21:17.810 --> 21:19.145
Ooh, what about children
of celebrities who pretend

21:19.178 --> 21:20.980
that it didn't help
their careers.

21:21.013 --> 21:25.017
These pot activists leech off of
people with legitimate problems

21:25.051 --> 21:26.453
in order to further
their agenda,

21:26.486 --> 21:27.754
which is just
getting high!

21:27.787 --> 21:29.422
Why did you make me do this?!

21:29.456 --> 21:30.857
I was looking out
for your best interests.

21:30.890 --> 21:33.259
Yeah, well,
I'm done with Dr. Weed.

21:33.292 --> 21:34.961
Hey! If I quit every time

21:34.994 --> 21:37.096
my mother pushed me
to do something hard,

21:37.129 --> 21:38.365
I wouldn't have... I-I...

21:38.398 --> 21:40.600
Okay, well, I guess
I did quit eventually

21:40.633 --> 21:42.535
to start doing drugs
and having unprotected sex

21:42.569 --> 21:43.536
with college boys.

21:43.570 --> 21:45.137
But the point...

21:45.171 --> 21:46.706
No! No more advice!

21:46.739 --> 21:48.641
I hate you.

21:48.675 --> 21:50.710
(gasps) I was trying
to help you fill your...

21:50.743 --> 21:52.011
(door opens, closes)

21:52.044 --> 21:53.346
(sighs)

21:53.380 --> 21:55.815
Look what I made!
I went to Kinko's.

21:55.848 --> 21:57.517
Talked to some undergrads
making a 'zine.

21:57.550 --> 21:59.352
It's a lovely place.
Anyway, turns out

21:59.386 --> 22:02.288
I've been living my entire life
in opposition to my father.

22:02.321 --> 22:05.057
And now that he's dead,
I have no idea who I really am.

22:05.091 --> 22:06.659
Am I even a writer?
Who knows?

22:06.693 --> 22:08.395
Maybe I'm meant to be
a master carpenter,

22:08.428 --> 22:10.296
slash tree house architect,
slash singer-songwriter.

22:10.329 --> 22:11.798
(chuckles)

22:11.831 --> 22:14.634
Anyways, although my zoo
animals are likely dead

22:14.667 --> 22:17.169
or escaped, I'd like to
thank you for taking that router

22:17.203 --> 22:18.638
and forcing me
to explore the world.

22:18.671 --> 22:20.407
Okay.

22:20.440 --> 22:22.074
I'm gonna go into the backyard
and test some branches

22:22.108 --> 22:23.376
for load-bearing capacity.

22:27.414 --> 22:30.149
(door opens, closes)

22:30.182 --> 22:31.418
(phone chimes)

22:44.030 --> 22:45.364
Hey.

22:45.398 --> 22:46.599
Oh, sorry.

22:46.633 --> 22:48.701
Look...
Jesus Christ.

22:48.735 --> 22:51.838
Ugh, what is that?!
What...

22:51.871 --> 22:55.007
Order mozzarella sticks
like a person. (gags)

22:55.041 --> 22:58.010
Anyway, I-I don't want you
to cream your jeans or anything

22:58.044 --> 22:59.345
'cause I know
they're your only pair,

22:59.378 --> 23:01.280
but maybe my mom
wasn't so great.

23:01.313 --> 23:02.449
Seriously?
What, did you hack my e-mail?

23:02.482 --> 23:04.116
I mean, the pressure
made me rad,

23:04.150 --> 23:05.785
but have you ever slept
with no sheets?

23:05.818 --> 23:07.754
So scratchy.

23:07.787 --> 23:09.456
Five out of ten.
Would bang.

23:09.489 --> 23:11.591
Yup, that's her.
GRETCHEN:
Actually,

23:11.624 --> 23:15.462
that was the first time
I fell into a depression.

23:15.495 --> 23:18.230
*
It was after a tennis match
and I had won,

23:18.264 --> 23:20.933
but not by enough,
'cause it was never enough.

23:20.967 --> 23:25.572
And my mom was doing this...
this food withholding thing.

23:25.605 --> 23:28.140
I think she saw something
about it on a TV show

23:28.174 --> 23:30.142
as a way to control
your dog or something.

23:30.176 --> 23:32.211
* Black lights on all night

23:32.244 --> 23:34.581
* The day couldn't see

23:34.614 --> 23:36.649
* Two mirrors were talking

23:36.683 --> 23:39.586
* Just not listening

23:39.619 --> 23:41.888
* Angel with fire

23:41.921 --> 23:44.090
* Making a scene

23:44.123 --> 23:48.828
* Well, what were you thinking
you'd shake out of me? *

23:48.861 --> 23:50.763
* Is it all in my head?

23:50.797 --> 23:52.264
* Am I wrong?

23:52.298 --> 23:53.900
* Oh, you're killing me,
killing me *

23:53.933 --> 23:56.168
* Chasing my tail...

23:56.202 --> 23:59.171
(dog barks)

24:02.208 --> 24:05.144
