HAPPY DAYS

01:28.830 --> 01:33.680
Season 2 Episode 11
"Guess Who's Coming to Christmas?"

01:35.450 --> 01:38.997
Hey, Dad, can we up
anybody over for tonight?

01:39.037 --> 01:41.157
Now look, I thought
we had that all settled.

01:41.197 --> 01:42.867
We decided that
this Christmas Eve

01:42.907 --> 01:44.560
was gonna be
strictly for the family.

01:44.980 --> 01:47.357
Can I have just summon
the chipmunks over?

01:47.397 --> 01:50.517
Oh no! No, that would ruin it.
No chipmunks.

01:50.557 --> 01:52.557
And no Richie's friends,
or no bedlam.

01:52.597 --> 01:55.957
It's gonna be a nice, quiet
Christmas Eve.

01:55.997 --> 01:57.757
It's just family tonight.

01:57.797 --> 01:59.117
We're gonna have fun.

01:59.157 --> 02:02.327
Look, well. We'll pop popcorn,
and we'll toast marshmallows,

02:02.367 --> 02:04.767
and we'll drink some
cider, and trim the tree,

02:04.807 --> 02:07.677
and then, later on, I'll read
"The Night before Christmas".

02:07.717 --> 02:10.717
Jingle bells, jingle bells,
boring all the way.

02:10.757 --> 02:12.867
No singing
at the table, Joanie.

02:12.907 --> 02:15.417
Eat your eggs, Scrooge.

02:15.457 --> 02:17.260
We know.
Bah! Humbug!

02:20.460 --> 02:24.237
Jingle bells, jingle bells,
jingle...

02:24.277 --> 02:27.157
All right.
Who's started trimming a tree?

02:27.197 --> 02:29.037
Whose sock is this on a tree?

02:29.077 --> 02:30.917
Hey, dad.

02:30.957 --> 02:34.047
Is that you, Chuck?
I didn't know you were here.

02:34.087 --> 02:35.460
Is this your sock?

02:36.060 --> 02:38.967
Oh, that must have fell off
that bag of laundry I've brought in.

02:39.007 --> 02:41.570
Yeah, see, it is not a Christmas sock.
It's a sweat sock.

02:42.500 --> 02:45.157
I should have known.
Listen, I'm glad you here.

02:45.197 --> 02:47.317
I want you to help me
put Santa up in the yard.

02:47.357 --> 02:48.797
- Richie!
- Yeah, Dad?

02:48.837 --> 02:51.077
I need some help
with Santa Claus.

02:51.117 --> 02:53.420
Santa is here?
I thought you said no outsiders.

02:55.620 --> 02:57.540
Everyone in this family
is a comedian.

02:59.860 --> 03:02.420
Okay, Chuck, plug it in.

03:02.940 --> 03:04.727
Okay, dad.

03:04.767 --> 03:07.487
One's hardly moving.
Richie, try to turn in the handle.

03:07.527 --> 03:10.340
- Which way?
- To the right, as "fast".

03:11.140 --> 03:14.457
- Slow down, Rich. Slow...
- All right.

03:14.497 --> 03:15.477
Oh-ow!

03:15.517 --> 03:17.467
- What's the matter?
- The knob came off.

03:17.507 --> 03:19.437
Here, let me see.

03:19.477 --> 03:21.317
- Catch him! Catch him!
- I've got him!

03:21.357 --> 03:24.397
I can't get this link back on.

03:24.437 --> 03:26.477
- Will you help me?
- That's really funny, Richie.

03:26.517 --> 03:28.317
What's going on here?

03:28.357 --> 03:30.447
What do you...
What does it look like, Marion?

03:30.487 --> 03:32.337
Looks like you're being
mugged by Santa Claus.

03:32.377 --> 03:34.100
Ho-ho-ho, Marion.

03:35.260 --> 03:36.437
Excuse me, miss.

03:36.477 --> 03:39.860
I couldn't help to notice that you're
standing under the mistletoe.

03:43.660 --> 03:44.837
Merry Christmas!

03:44.877 --> 03:47.037
- Works every time, Ralphie.
- Hey.

03:47.077 --> 03:49.237
That's pretty neat.
How about me try it out?

03:49.277 --> 03:50.820
Why not.

03:51.930 --> 03:54.357
- Hey, that's Wendy.
- No, no. Not Wendy.

03:54.397 --> 03:55.677
Why not?
Here's your chance.

03:55.717 --> 03:56.957
- Now you do it.
- Okay.

03:56.997 --> 04:00.454
Hey, Wendy.
Can you come here for a sec?

04:00.494 --> 04:02.637
Is something wrong
with hamburger?

04:02.677 --> 04:06.517
No, but you're standing
under the mistletoe.

04:06.557 --> 04:08.877
It's parsley.

04:08.917 --> 04:12.300
Tough break. You picked
somebody who know salad.

04:13.140 --> 04:16.237
Hey, Marsh.
Got Christmas gift for ya.

04:16.277 --> 04:17.397
Thank you, Fonzie.

04:17.437 --> 04:19.997
Oh hey, and this is for you,
my little sugar plum fairy.

04:20.036 --> 04:21.156
Gee, thanks!

04:21.197 --> 04:23.477
And here is Louie,
Huey and Dewey.

04:23.517 --> 04:26.757
Merry Christmas, Merry
Christmas and Merry Christmas.

04:26.797 --> 04:27.917
Thanks.

04:27.957 --> 04:29.567
I don't have
anything for you, Fonz.

04:29.607 --> 04:32.217
So what? Christmas is
for giving, not receiving.

04:32.257 --> 04:34.697
I don't get it.
What's the act, Fonzie?

04:34.737 --> 04:36.217
Hey, what do you mean by act?

04:36.257 --> 04:37.997
Do you say I don't have
any Christmas spirit?

04:38.037 --> 04:39.677
Oh no, no, Fonz.
A lot of spirit.

04:39.717 --> 04:42.397
It's written all over your face.
You're walking Christmas card.

04:42.437 --> 04:45.487
Yeah. Just so happens that
I am very big on Christmas.

04:45.527 --> 04:47.557
I thought that was
well known about the Fonz.

04:47.597 --> 04:49.787
Oh, Fonzie, I just had
to open your present.

04:49.827 --> 04:54.067
It's beautiful.
Look, fellas, what it says.

04:54.107 --> 04:55.837
"You are the ginchiest."

04:55.877 --> 04:58.047
Isn't that something?

04:58.087 --> 05:00.810
There is a heart
underneath all that leather.

05:02.260 --> 05:06.197
This is from me, Fonzie.
That was the best I could do.

05:06.237 --> 05:09.007
Marsha, this is beautiful.

05:09.047 --> 05:11.697
You're a real Picasso-Pistachio,
you know what I mean?

05:11.737 --> 05:13.810
Oh, Fonzie!

05:14.340 --> 05:17.237
Hey, Fonz, since I
didn't get you anything,

05:17.277 --> 05:19.780
how about come into my home
for Christmas Turkey?

05:20.780 --> 05:23.540
- I've got plans.
- Yeah? What you're doing, Fonz?

05:24.180 --> 05:25.637
Oh...

05:25.677 --> 05:27.300
Well, uh...

05:27.780 --> 05:30.997
I'm going up to Waukesha.

05:31.037 --> 05:32.420
- Waukesha?
- Yeah.

05:32.900 --> 05:34.317
Yeah.

05:34.357 --> 05:36.637
I've got to debrief the thing
on Christmas time.

05:36.677 --> 05:39.157
My cousin lives up there.
A big house.

05:39.197 --> 05:41.140
They spread, they put up
for Christmas...

05:43.220 --> 05:46.277
See, you know, uh,
lots of presents, big family,

05:46.317 --> 05:49.637
big family,
big house, uh, lights...

05:49.677 --> 05:52.540
a big-big tree. Works.

05:53.900 --> 05:56.077
Oh yeah. Time no much
for family, you know.

05:56.117 --> 05:58.127
But I figured, once a year
I could take it.

05:58.167 --> 06:00.417
I'm leaving tonight
on a 4 o'clock bus.

06:00.457 --> 06:01.917
Have a good time.

06:01.957 --> 06:03.877
- Yeah, it sounds nice.
- Thanks.

06:03.917 --> 06:06.637
Yeah. There's something about
Christmas that gets to me, you know.

06:06.677 --> 06:08.540
Must be the spirit or something.

06:10.260 --> 06:12.637
It's beautiful, just beautiful.

06:12.677 --> 06:16.317
And so sweet.
Look, boys. See, what it says?

06:16.357 --> 06:18.300
"You are the ginchiest."

06:19.140 --> 06:21.557
You're such a poet, Fonzie.

06:21.597 --> 06:23.460
Hey.

06:25.540 --> 06:30.759
"Cunningham hardware
Have a cup of Christmas Cheer!"

06:30.799 --> 06:32.648
Merry Christmas to you.

06:32.688 --> 06:34.837
Bye-bye.

06:34.877 --> 06:38.247
How come she only pays her will
on a Christmas Eve, huh?

06:38.287 --> 06:41.517
Okay, everybody.
Stop working. Party time!

06:41.557 --> 06:43.277
Mrs. Harrison, how about
some egg-nogg?

06:43.317 --> 06:45.847
I'll wink anything,
but screwdriver.

06:45.887 --> 06:47.437
I'll see another
the whole year through.

06:47.477 --> 06:49.287
How about a rusty nail?

06:49.327 --> 06:51.167
Oh, he's just pomp your leg,
Mrs. Harrison.

06:51.207 --> 06:53.067
I just try to get a Niven.

06:53.107 --> 06:54.837
Dad, is that something
wrong with Buzz?

06:54.877 --> 06:56.220
He hasn't said a word all day.

06:57.980 --> 07:00.740
Oh. He's okay.

07:01.300 --> 07:04.037
His tongue gets numb
when he drinks.

07:04.077 --> 07:05.940
I think the numbness
spread to his body.

07:07.100 --> 07:10.157
Now I'd like to present
a little Christmas toast

07:10.197 --> 07:13.557
to the best personnel
of hardware store I ever had.

07:13.597 --> 07:16.837
- Hip-hip...
- Hurray! Hurray!

07:16.877 --> 07:20.277
Past the lips and over the gums...

07:20.317 --> 07:23.620
Look out tummy, here it comes.

07:25.220 --> 07:26.260
Very appropriate.

07:26.900 --> 07:29.237
Hey, Buzz, how about you?

07:29.277 --> 07:32.300
We have non of word from you
all afternoon.

07:37.300 --> 07:40.500
Well, maybe next Christmas.

07:45.220 --> 07:47.877
We're luck.
Fonzie's still at the garage.

07:47.917 --> 07:50.037
He says, he could fix it
if we get push it over there.

07:50.077 --> 07:52.580
Well, hurry up, before it gets dark.

07:53.540 --> 07:57.740
Why it is, that this car always picks
Sundays and holidays to get sick?

07:59.340 --> 08:00.767
All right.

08:00.807 --> 08:02.857
It's just a little leak
in your water hose.

08:02.897 --> 08:03.827
You ready to go now.

08:03.867 --> 08:06.347
Oh, thanks, Fonzie. Look, what.
How much do I owe you?

08:06.387 --> 08:09.477
Hey, it's Christmas Eve.
It's my little present to you.

08:09.517 --> 08:11.837
Oh, no, no, no.
I couldn't except that.

08:11.877 --> 08:13.140
I said it was my present.

08:14.300 --> 08:15.900
Well, thanks, Fonzie.

08:16.820 --> 08:19.097
Look, it's after four.
You missed your bus, Fonz.

08:19.137 --> 08:20.587
So what?
I'll catch the one at five.

08:20.627 --> 08:22.747
Yeah, but your cousins and everybody
are gonna be waiting for you.

08:22.787 --> 08:24.997
I think I just said, "So what?".

08:25.037 --> 08:28.437
Gee, I feel bad
about you missing your bus.

08:28.477 --> 08:29.317
Look, I'll tell you what.

08:29.357 --> 08:31.307
Why don't we go somewhere
and have some coffee and donuts

08:31.347 --> 08:32.437
till you catch the next one?

08:32.477 --> 08:33.447
Oh, no. No, it's okay.

08:33.486 --> 08:35.297
I can't eat right now.
I've got to save my appetite.

08:35.337 --> 08:37.047
The food they put up
for Christmas Eve

08:37.087 --> 08:38.437
is not to be believe!

08:38.477 --> 08:39.397
Listen, I got an idea.

08:39.437 --> 08:41.677
Waukesha is about what,
25 miles away?

08:41.717 --> 08:43.817
Why don't we just drive
Fonzie to his cousins?

08:43.857 --> 08:45.227
- Oh no.
- It's all right.

08:45.267 --> 08:47.677
We'll make get home and
have plenty of time for dinner.

08:47.717 --> 08:50.677
We could do that. Yeah.
We'll drive you to the Waukesha.

08:50.717 --> 08:52.557
No. No, it's okay, huh?

08:52.597 --> 08:54.637
And why don't you two guys
just get out of here?

08:54.677 --> 08:55.967
I did just a little job for you.

08:56.007 --> 08:57.667
Let's not make
a federal case out of this.

08:57.707 --> 08:59.890
Okay, okay.
Don't get so exited.

09:01.700 --> 09:03.050
Come on, Rich. Let's go.

09:10.860 --> 09:12.117
Hey, Mr. C.

09:12.157 --> 09:14.877
I know you're just trying
to be helpful, huh?

09:14.917 --> 09:16.477
That's okay, Fonzie.

09:16.517 --> 09:18.157
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

09:18.197 --> 09:20.780
Yeah, yeah. Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

09:42.420 --> 09:44.917
- What's the matter?
- I forgot to give Fonzie his present.

09:44.957 --> 09:48.260
- I got him three-in-one wrench.
- Well, give it to him.

10:28.420 --> 10:29.807
- Dad, I think...
- Richard.

10:29.847 --> 10:32.297
It's almost time for
an old-fashioned Christmas,

10:32.337 --> 10:34.197
and I am really
looking forward to it.

10:34.237 --> 10:35.847
It's gonna be just great.

10:35.887 --> 10:39.787
Just our all family
having Christmas together.

10:39.827 --> 10:41.420
Yeah.

10:45.700 --> 10:48.157
Jingle bells, jingle bells,

10:48.197 --> 10:50.327
jingle all the way.

10:50.367 --> 10:52.137
Yah-ta-ta, yah-ta-ta.

10:52.177 --> 10:54.007
You know, as soon as we
get the street tremor,

10:54.047 --> 10:56.027
I've gotta make us all
some nice hot cider

10:56.067 --> 10:57.507
and then we're gonna roast
some marshmallows,

10:57.547 --> 10:58.957
and pop the popcorn,

10:58.997 --> 11:01.597
and do all of fun things we used
to do when you kids were little.

11:01.637 --> 11:05.397
And we don't have to put our PJ's on
with the flyaway bottoms, do we?

11:05.437 --> 11:07.690
You better not, Chuck,
or your brain will catch cold.

11:09.140 --> 11:11.797
Hey look, Rich, we're having fun.

11:11.837 --> 11:13.687
Oh yeah, yeah. Fun.

11:13.727 --> 11:16.557
Oh-ow. Who put
the two green ones together?

11:16.597 --> 11:18.557
Howard, it's always
red, green, yellow, blue,

11:18.597 --> 11:19.757
red, green, yellow, blue.

11:19.797 --> 11:21.477
What is that, Santa's law?

11:21.517 --> 11:23.420
You made a mistake,
you don't try to defend it.

11:24.260 --> 11:27.007
Hi Chuck, here is the present
from Richie to you.

11:27.047 --> 11:28.100
What do you think it is?

11:29.300 --> 11:31.157
Hey, watch it.

11:31.197 --> 11:33.637
It might be
something breakable.

11:33.677 --> 11:34.767
Okay.

11:34.807 --> 11:38.220
I'm all set to put the star
on top of the tree.

11:38.540 --> 11:41.447
There we go.

11:41.487 --> 11:43.387
Okay, somebody plug in
the lights now.

11:43.427 --> 11:44.740
I will.

11:46.900 --> 11:48.517
Hey, they didn't go on.

11:48.557 --> 11:52.807
Well, it's still a nice tree,
even if it is a little dark.

11:52.847 --> 11:55.097
There must be a bad bulb.
Chuck, check it, huh?

11:55.137 --> 11:56.500
Right, dad.

11:58.700 --> 11:59.877
What's the matter with you?

11:59.917 --> 12:02.477
You've been mopping around
ever since we got home.

12:02.517 --> 12:04.757
Well, I guess I'm just
thinking about Fonzie.

12:04.797 --> 12:07.050
Fonzie? Why Fonzie?

12:07.820 --> 12:10.317
Dad, I don't think
he went to Waukesha.

12:10.357 --> 12:11.527
Sure, he did.

12:11.567 --> 12:14.117
Now look. He is with his family,
you are with your family.

12:14.157 --> 12:15.860
You're both where you belong.

12:16.420 --> 12:18.837
Richard, do you think
Fonzie is really alone?

12:18.877 --> 12:20.207
Yeah, I'm sure of it.

12:20.247 --> 12:23.267
Well, he made up some big story
about the party in Waukesha,

12:23.307 --> 12:25.157
but I know he's at home.

12:25.197 --> 12:27.297
I saw him eating ravioli
out of the can.

12:27.337 --> 12:29.947
Now what king of way is that
to spend Christmas Eve?

12:29.987 --> 12:32.060
Oh, poor Fonzie.

12:37.430 --> 12:40.167
Look, how 'bout singing
"Jingle bells", huh?

12:40.207 --> 12:41.587
Jingle bells, jingle bells...

12:41.627 --> 12:43.890
Oh, come on, Marion.
It's your favorite.

12:44.340 --> 12:47.340
Oh. Howard, I don't feel
like singing.

12:52.300 --> 12:53.947
Well, why don't you phone him?

12:53.987 --> 12:56.180
I tried. There's no answer.

12:57.980 --> 12:59.497
Dad.

12:59.537 --> 13:02.600
Why don't we just go over there?

13:02.910 --> 13:05.557
Yes, after all, it is a Christmas.

13:05.597 --> 13:08.877
Yeah, season of peace on Earth
and goodwill towards men.

13:08.917 --> 13:11.077
- Didoes!
- Now, wait a minute, wait a minute.

13:11.117 --> 13:13.527
You're all missing the whole
point of Christmas Eve.

13:13.567 --> 13:15.177
I mean, it's a family time.

13:15.217 --> 13:18.757
We spend time together,
doing all the fun things.

13:18.797 --> 13:22.497
Like trimming the tree
and drinking egg-nogg.

13:22.537 --> 13:26.017
And singing Christmas carols,
and decking the halls,

13:26.057 --> 13:27.727
and jingling the bells...

13:27.767 --> 13:30.700
and thinking of Fonzie.
Let's get our clothes on.

13:33.540 --> 13:35.577
Do you see, Dad?
He's in there.

13:35.617 --> 13:37.450
Go ahead. Knock.

13:38.420 --> 13:40.907
Didn't it could be embarrassing,
catching him like this?

13:40.947 --> 13:42.097
I mean, it could be embarrassing.

13:42.137 --> 13:44.617
Now look, Richie, you took us
away from our Christmas Eve,

13:44.657 --> 13:46.197
and you brought us
all away down here.

13:46.237 --> 13:47.597
- All right, all right.
- Get knock.

13:47.637 --> 13:49.560
I'll think of something to say.

13:50.820 --> 13:53.380
Fonz? It's me, Rich.

13:58.660 --> 14:01.900
Look, I know you're in there,
Fonz, I heard the music.

14:04.260 --> 14:07.837
Hey, Mr. C, how are ya?
My bus leaves in 15 minutes.

14:07.877 --> 14:09.377
I was just done my way
down at the station.

14:09.417 --> 14:11.147
I thought you catch in
the 6 o'clock. It's almost 8.

14:11.187 --> 14:13.237
Yeah well, a packing took me longer
than I thought, you know.

14:13.277 --> 14:14.927
I didn't know what to wear
and, uh...

14:14.967 --> 14:16.407
You want hop me down
to the station? Come on.

14:16.447 --> 14:19.387
Well, look, Fonzie. We'd like to
talk to you for just a second.

14:19.427 --> 14:22.237
- I'm gonna miss my bus.
- Just for a second, Fonz.

14:22.277 --> 14:24.437
All right.
But just for a second, huh?

14:24.477 --> 14:26.700
I mean, I don't want to miss my bus.

14:31.860 --> 14:34.040
- I travel light.
- Yeah.

14:36.900 --> 14:38.887
Hey, this is very nice place
you got here.

14:38.927 --> 14:41.757
Yeah. My bike likes it.

14:41.797 --> 14:43.877
You always park your bike
in your apartment?

14:43.917 --> 14:45.187
No, only in inclining weather.

14:45.227 --> 14:47.637
That's why I'm keeping it here,
where it's nice and warm.

14:47.677 --> 14:49.540
So, uh, what can I do for ya?

14:50.900 --> 14:52.540
Well, uh...

14:53.980 --> 14:57.157
Richie has something
he wants to ask you.

14:57.197 --> 14:58.200
Yeah, what's up?

15:00.140 --> 15:03.580
Well, we were wondering if, uh...

15:05.060 --> 15:07.437
if you mind not rather go to
Waukesha in the morning,

15:07.477 --> 15:09.527
and spend Christmas Eve with us.

15:09.567 --> 15:11.007
I mean, we did hold you up.

15:11.047 --> 15:13.507
Are you kiddin'?
They're waitin' for me.

15:13.547 --> 15:16.157
Yeah, but we have this really
terrific tree this year.

15:16.197 --> 15:17.700
And I just wish you could see it.

15:19.260 --> 15:20.700
I've got a tree.

15:24.540 --> 15:26.140
Oh, that's a very nice tree.

15:28.700 --> 15:31.197
Yeah, it reminds me that, uh...

15:31.237 --> 15:34.200
Well, I got you a present.
I forgot to give it to you before.

15:36.580 --> 15:37.650
Thanks.

15:41.140 --> 15:43.207
Well, I'm gonna get catch that bus.

15:43.247 --> 15:45.217
- Wait a minute, Fonzie.
- Wait a minute.

15:45.257 --> 15:46.357
Just a minute.

15:46.397 --> 15:50.140
I've got to tell you the real
reason why we're here.

15:51.100 --> 15:54.620
The... the real reason
we here is, uh...

15:55.730 --> 15:57.997
Do you remember
that Santa Claus

15:58.037 --> 16:00.587
that we put out
in our yard every year?

16:00.627 --> 16:04.797
Well, for some reason,
it's not working this year.

16:04.837 --> 16:06.877
Yeah. Yeah, Dad's right.

16:06.917 --> 16:09.250
We can't fix it.
We hate to bother you, but...

16:09.740 --> 16:13.500
Well, that Santa is sort
of a tradition with us.

16:14.370 --> 16:16.177
Well, it sounds simple.

16:16.217 --> 16:18.117
I could probably fix that
in two seconds.

16:18.157 --> 16:21.257
Well, of course.
And I hate to bother you again,

16:21.297 --> 16:24.747
especially you're up here putting
all that time on our car, but...

16:24.787 --> 16:28.877
Well, something is really missing
if the Santa doesn't work.

16:28.917 --> 16:30.647
All right, I'll fix it.

16:30.687 --> 16:32.417
But then I go and catch
the 9 o'clock bus,

16:32.457 --> 16:33.997
and it's the last one
tonight, huh?

16:34.037 --> 16:36.117
And there's no way
I'm gonna miss that buss.

16:36.157 --> 16:37.277
Come on.

16:37.317 --> 16:39.820
- Nice going, Dad.
- Thanks.

16:56.140 --> 16:58.610
Well, try another one, Chuck.

17:01.380 --> 17:03.690
Hey, Fonzie fixed Santa!

17:05.940 --> 17:08.637
Hi, you did a terrific job
on Santa, Fonzie.

17:08.676 --> 17:10.237
Thanks.

17:10.277 --> 17:11.257
Hi, Fonzie.

17:11.297 --> 17:13.196
Merry Christmas, Fonzie.

17:13.237 --> 17:17.186
Merry Christmas, Mrs. C.
Yeah. Glad tidings.

17:17.227 --> 17:20.847
Hey, this is nice,
it's real cozy.

17:20.887 --> 17:23.646
Hey, you people got
a nice tree, too.

17:23.686 --> 17:25.130
Well, thank you.

17:25.619 --> 17:28.237
Would you like some hot cider?
Worm you up.

17:28.277 --> 17:31.407
Well, yeah, maybe half a cup,
but I got to go in a minute.

17:31.447 --> 17:33.507
- Why don't you sit down, Fonz?
- No, no. I can't do it.

17:33.547 --> 17:35.497
- I gotta go, you know that.
- Yes, we heard that.

17:35.537 --> 17:37.227
I'm gonna have a nice time
of that, too, you know.

17:37.267 --> 17:39.157
They got a living room
twice as size of this.

17:39.197 --> 17:42.637
Better tree, nine-footer,
lots of presents around, you know.

17:42.677 --> 17:44.957
Dad, I cant find the bad one.
It's just doesn't work.

17:44.997 --> 17:47.717
- Keep trying, Chuck.
- I went through the whole string.

17:47.757 --> 17:49.637
We're just gonna have
to do without lights.

17:49.677 --> 17:51.317
Hey, what's the matter here?

17:51.357 --> 17:54.157
Well, the lights work for one,
and then they just went out.

17:54.197 --> 17:56.487
Yeah. I went through the whole
string with this new bulb.

17:56.527 --> 17:58.287
Yeah, did you ever think
that this new bulb

17:58.327 --> 17:59.917
might be the bad one, too?

17:59.957 --> 18:01.957
Well, it crossed my mind.

18:01.997 --> 18:03.717
But I thought I'd better
go ahead and check 'em all

18:03.757 --> 18:05.437
before I jumped
to any conclusions.

18:05.477 --> 18:06.697
Yeah, good thinking, huh?

18:06.737 --> 18:09.027
A Christmas tree
got to have lights.

18:09.067 --> 18:12.980
Without lights it's like
a pizza without mozzarella.

18:13.780 --> 18:15.220
This would take me
about a minute.

18:18.020 --> 18:20.290
How'd you people ever get
through Thanksgiving?

18:26.260 --> 18:27.477
There they go.

18:27.517 --> 18:28.757
- Hey, look at this!
- It's great!

18:28.797 --> 18:29.957
This is the bad one.

18:29.997 --> 18:31.957
What would we do
without you, Fonzie?

18:31.997 --> 18:33.407
Now you'd be up a creep, Mrs. C.

18:33.447 --> 18:35.197
Yeah, our car would be
stuck in the snow,

18:35.237 --> 18:36.347
our tree would be out,

18:36.387 --> 18:38.620
and our Santa Claus would be
mugging the neighbors.

18:39.940 --> 18:43.100
Yeah, but I hate to tell you,
this is 3 minutes past nine.

18:44.420 --> 18:47.060
Oh, you missed
your bus to Waukesha.

18:47.820 --> 18:51.340
- Yeah, that's the last one tonight.
- Yeah, I know.

18:54.300 --> 18:56.647
Well, why don't you
stay here tonight?

18:56.687 --> 18:59.317
Even if it's not as good as
your cousin's house.

18:59.357 --> 19:01.717
Well, I wouldn't say
it's not as good.

19:01.757 --> 19:03.227
Yeah, Fonzie, why don't you
just stick around?

19:03.267 --> 19:04.357
We'd like to have you.

19:04.397 --> 19:05.900
Right, Dad?

19:06.940 --> 19:08.717
Look, he wants to go.

19:08.757 --> 19:10.007
If you want to go to Waukesha,

19:10.047 --> 19:11.707
I'll tell you what,
I'll drive you to Waukesha.

19:11.747 --> 19:13.317
I can be back in an hour.

19:13.357 --> 19:16.807
Oh hey, Mr. C.,
it's really snowing hot now.

19:16.847 --> 19:18.587
I mean, I couldn't make
you drive all the way.

19:18.627 --> 19:20.507
You've got all the way
back in the snow.

19:20.547 --> 19:23.117
Fonzie, you're staying here.

19:23.157 --> 19:25.140
And I don't want to hear
another word about it.

19:26.300 --> 19:29.677
Hey, Mrs. C., my mother
used to talk to me like that.

19:29.717 --> 19:32.717
The only one who used
to get away with it, too.

19:32.757 --> 19:34.260
Until you.

19:36.620 --> 19:38.660
I accept your invitation.

19:43.500 --> 19:46.797
All right, everybody, let's get
back to popping the popcorn.

19:46.837 --> 19:48.419
Richie, brought some
marshmallows, huh?

19:48.459 --> 19:49.780
All right, Dad.

19:56.500 --> 19:59.797
Hey, Mr. C. Thanks a lot.

19:59.837 --> 20:03.740
- For what?
- I knew you hip to Waukesha.

20:04.250 --> 20:08.780
Well, to tell you the truth, Fonzie.
It was Richie who figured it out.

20:12.540 --> 20:14.477
Hey, do you mind if I did that?

20:14.517 --> 20:16.037
I was just noticing,
you don't do it right.

20:16.077 --> 20:20.100
See, to pop popcorn you got to get
much more the shaking motion.

20:20.140 --> 20:21.380
Oh?

20:21.420 --> 20:24.617
- Okay. Here.
- Thanks.

20:24.657 --> 20:26.580
Uh-huh.

20:32.660 --> 20:36.944
Thanks for having all of your
freckles in the right place.

20:36.984 --> 20:38.690
Hey, don't burn
those marshmallows.

20:38.730 --> 20:40.050
Here, keep turning them.
Keep turning.

20:40.090 --> 20:42.387
- Yeah, right.
- Yeah, like that, this way.

20:42.427 --> 20:45.277
Say, would someone like to read
"The Night before Christmas?

20:45.317 --> 20:47.727
Oh hey, I'd love to do that.
Would you mind if I did that?

20:47.767 --> 20:50.993
There's one thing I'm really great at.
That's reading poetry. All right?

20:51.033 --> 20:53.480
My gather repute.

20:54.300 --> 20:56.770
- Is everybody ready?
- Yeah.

20:57.540 --> 20:59.180
Hey, here we go.

21:00.820 --> 21:04.717
Twas the night before Christmas,
when all through the house

21:04.757 --> 21:08.477
Not a creature was stirring,
not even a mouse.

21:08.517 --> 21:10.317
Can you believe it?

21:10.357 --> 21:13.597
The stockings were hung
by the chimney with care,

21:13.637 --> 21:17.152
In hopes that St Nicholas
soon would be there.

21:17.192 --> 21:19.130
See?

21:19.580 --> 21:22.637
The children were nestled
all snug in their beds,

21:22.677 --> 21:27.640
While visions of sugar-plums
danced in their heads.

21:32.910 --> 21:34.097
Hey, wait a minute, Rich.

21:34.137 --> 21:35.667
Make sure you get
the ball on the picture.

21:35.707 --> 21:37.810
Well, you better put it
in the other hand.

21:39.740 --> 21:42.050
All right, I got it.

21:44.700 --> 21:48.130
Very nice palm trees, kid.

21:48.700 --> 21:52.207
Oh, and here is the Polynesian
girls baiting in the palm.

21:52.247 --> 21:54.210
Let me see that.

21:54.900 --> 21:56.837
It's just more palm trees.

21:56.877 --> 21:59.370
That's one for the kid.

22:02.820 --> 22:06.847
- Dinner is served.
- I'm ready.

22:06.887 --> 22:10.107
Well, Fonzie, it is so nice to have
you on a Christmas dinner.

22:10.147 --> 22:12.117
- Hey, it's my pleasure.
- Right over there.

22:12.157 --> 22:15.517
I have a room the next Easter.
You must come. Should be my place.

22:15.557 --> 22:17.787
- This looks terrific.
- Beautiful table, Marion.

22:17.827 --> 22:19.547
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

22:19.587 --> 22:21.727
Are you gonna to say
a grace, dear?

22:21.767 --> 22:23.377
Well, I kinda thought,

22:23.417 --> 22:25.197
that since Fonzie was
in guest for dinner,

22:25.237 --> 22:26.730
maybe he'd like to say it.

22:27.780 --> 22:29.220
Oh hey, uh...

22:38.460 --> 22:40.140
Oh, okay.

22:45.660 --> 22:46.970
Hey, God?

22:49.340 --> 22:50.900
Thanks.
