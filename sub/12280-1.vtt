<b>KUNG FU BROTHER</b>

00:27.267 --> 00:30.267
<b>Subrip: Pix</b>

02:19.811 --> 02:21.647
Jack, we are ready.

02:21.679 --> 02:22.681
Okay.

02:23.548 --> 02:25.784
Don't you think
the meat is done?

02:28.119 --> 02:30.789
Just can't give that E.
Coli a chance, you know?

02:32.191 --> 02:34.694
I still see some pink.

02:38.496 --> 02:39.531
I'm goin'
in to watch the game.

02:39.565 --> 02:42.567
No, no, no, don't go
in now, Pop, you promised.

02:42.601 --> 02:43.536
Come on.

02:43.568 --> 02:45.537
Surprise!

03:00.185 --> 03:02.121
Now everyone knows my age.

03:03.721 --> 03:06.958
Hey, what
are y'all talkin' about?

03:06.992 --> 03:08.727
You.

03:10.629 --> 03:13.433
You know, it's amazing how
much you look like your mother.

03:13.465 --> 03:16.568
Yeah, well I may look like
Mom, but I am your chip, Pop.

03:16.601 --> 03:19.638
Son, I'm talkin' about
your mother and me.

03:19.672 --> 03:22.776
Hey, Dad, Mom didn't
leave you, she died.

03:24.609 --> 03:26.478
How can I forget?

03:30.683 --> 03:33.752
Well that was touching.

03:38.224 --> 03:39.525
What?

03:40.792 --> 03:41.693
You were just crying.

03:41.727 --> 03:43.595
Well I had to do
somethin' to get in here.

03:43.629 --> 03:45.731
It's the 9th inning!

03:45.763 --> 03:47.499
This is Karen Takoni
live at the corner

03:47.532 --> 03:48.733
of 3rd and San Pedro

03:48.767 --> 03:51.603
where yet another brutal
killing has taken place.

03:51.637 --> 03:52.738
She's back.

03:52.770 --> 03:53.773
Karen.

03:53.805 --> 03:55.674
Does he know?

03:55.708 --> 03:57.609
No, I don't think he knows.

03:57.643 --> 03:59.479
Dad.

04:03.781 --> 04:05.184
Listen, I'm sorry.

04:06.719 --> 04:08.855
I guess I'm just
still not over Karen.

04:12.892 --> 04:14.127
Group hug.

04:27.940 --> 04:28.975
Yeah?

04:30.842 --> 04:32.511
Yeah?

04:32.545 --> 04:33.713
Yeah, on my way.

04:35.613 --> 04:36.748
What's up?

04:36.781 --> 04:38.284
They found your
missing millionaire.

04:38.317 --> 04:39.584
Where?

04:39.618 --> 04:41.687
At the Swagman
Hotel in Thai Town.

04:41.719 --> 04:43.555
Chief wants to see me.

04:43.589 --> 04:44.824
I'll meet you at the scene.

04:51.697 --> 04:52.964
What you got, Henry?

04:52.998 --> 04:55.635
Gary Figomoto, 36
year old Asian male.

04:55.668 --> 04:56.903
Been missin' for
over four weeks.

04:56.935 --> 04:58.738
Body found decapitated.

04:58.771 --> 05:00.306
Girlfriend was the only witness.

05:00.339 --> 05:02.240
But she's so coked up.

05:02.274 --> 05:03.942
Hotel manager says he
rarely saw the victim

05:03.976 --> 05:05.545
except for at night.

05:05.577 --> 05:07.812
Room's paid up six
months in advance.

05:07.846 --> 05:10.316
Well there goes our
kidnap for ransom theory.

05:10.349 --> 05:11.683
If I lived in Bel Air,

05:11.716 --> 05:13.752
why would I check
into a dump like this?

05:13.786 --> 05:15.788
Obviously he didn't wanna
be seen with Cinderella there.

05:16.955 --> 05:18.056
For six months?

05:18.089 --> 05:19.825
She ain't that ugly.

05:19.858 --> 05:21.694
He wasn't missing,
he was hiding.

05:21.726 --> 05:22.827
He knew the killer.

05:22.861 --> 05:23.896
Murder weapon?

05:23.928 --> 05:26.265
Still looking, but whatever
it was, it was sharp.

05:50.723 --> 05:51.824
Well it's your blood.

05:52.890 --> 05:54.660
So we meet again.

05:55.894 --> 05:58.030
It's called a.

05:58.062 --> 06:00.800
An ancient japanese
symbol of power.

06:00.832 --> 06:04.303
Gentlemen, I'd like to
introduce you to someone.

06:05.803 --> 06:07.639
This is Nathan Nett.

06:07.673 --> 06:09.709
He's on loan from the
government of Thailand.

06:09.741 --> 06:12.077
I've been tracking these
murderers for quite some time.

06:12.111 --> 06:13.779
Really?

06:15.880 --> 06:16.748
Listen.

06:17.582 --> 06:20.051
Nathan's family took
me in back in '69

06:20.084 --> 06:22.053
when I was stationed in Bangkok.

06:22.087 --> 06:24.156
I owe him.

06:24.188 --> 06:26.758
Now, I know you
don't like outsiders

06:26.791 --> 06:28.361
but he's only here to help.

06:28.394 --> 06:31.831
And right now any
little help will do.

06:31.863 --> 06:33.933
And I don't have to
mention how it rolls.

06:35.700 --> 06:36.701
Down hill.

06:36.735 --> 06:38.771
How far up this time?

06:38.803 --> 06:39.972
The governor.

06:41.807 --> 06:45.177
Share all pertinent
info with Agent Nett

06:45.209 --> 06:48.147
and treat him with the
utmost professional courtesy.

06:48.180 --> 06:50.916
Or I swear to God, I'll
suspend both of you

06:50.949 --> 06:52.885
before you can
say "without pay."

06:52.918 --> 06:54.086
-But, Dad...
-Captain!

07:05.964 --> 07:09.000
Welcome aboard.

07:09.034 --> 07:12.103
Well, Agent Nett is it?

07:12.137 --> 07:14.774
You can call me Nathan.

07:14.807 --> 07:18.010
Well, Nathan, you can
call me Detective Emerson.

07:18.043 --> 07:19.712
Fine.

07:21.880 --> 07:25.750
So, what do you know
about these murderers?

07:25.784 --> 07:27.752
How many others
have there been?

07:27.786 --> 07:29.954
So far
we got no suspects.

07:29.988 --> 07:31.891
One witness.

07:31.923 --> 07:33.191
Well, no witness.

07:33.224 --> 07:36.394
No motives, not even
a single fingerprint.

07:36.428 --> 07:38.096
And we're fresh out of DNA.

07:38.130 --> 07:39.764
Thus far the only
connection are these stars

07:39.798 --> 07:42.000
and the fact that all
the victims are Asian.

07:42.034 --> 07:44.070
So what's this gotta
do with Thailand?

07:44.103 --> 07:45.738
It's classified.

07:46.738 --> 07:47.972
Police say they
have no suspects

07:48.005 --> 07:52.410
to what is now being dubbed as

07:52.444 --> 07:54.113
The Weirding Murders.

07:57.014 --> 07:59.151
Are you okay?

07:59.183 --> 08:01.252
Yes, yeah, yeah.

08:01.286 --> 08:02.755
Let's go again.

08:02.788 --> 08:04.157
All right, ready
when you ready.

08:07.159 --> 08:08.827
I need to go to the
Asaka Martial Arts School

08:08.861 --> 08:10.995
in the Palisades as
soon as possible.

08:11.029 --> 08:12.898
Here's the address.

08:12.930 --> 08:13.933
What's up there?

08:13.966 --> 08:14.966
There's a man
there by the name

08:15.000 --> 08:16.469
of Hirohito Fujimoto.

08:16.502 --> 08:18.871
If we get there in time,
he may be able to help us.

08:18.904 --> 08:21.774
"Help," what you, a backup
singer with the Beatles now?

08:21.807 --> 08:24.043
"Fujimoto," so where
have I heard that name?

08:24.075 --> 08:25.978
He's very
important to this case.

08:26.011 --> 08:27.747
Yo, I'm hungry, you hungry?

08:27.780 --> 08:28.781
Let's eat, man.

08:28.814 --> 08:29.915
We really must hurry.

08:29.948 --> 08:31.817
Listen, Mr. Miyagi can wait.

08:31.849 --> 08:34.453
When Jack's gotta
eat, Jack's gotta eat.

08:41.126 --> 08:42.495
Yo!

08:45.531 --> 08:49.202
So, Nathan, what kinda
cop are you in Thailand?

08:51.869 --> 08:53.805
Good afternoon,
what can I get for you?

08:53.839 --> 08:55.840
Yeah, gimme a Number
Two with cheese,

08:55.873 --> 08:58.911
extra ketchup, extra
mayo, cut in half.

09:01.345 --> 09:05.784
Taco salad, no meat, no
cheese, large cup of water.

09:09.521 --> 09:10.656
Might as well
order somethin', man.

09:10.689 --> 09:13.092
It's gonna be a while before
we get a chance to eat again.

09:14.926 --> 09:16.995
I'll have a large
milk and an apple.

09:19.531 --> 09:22.968
Listen, Einstein,
this is a burger joint.

09:23.001 --> 09:24.336
Fast food.

09:24.368 --> 09:26.238
They don't got milk and
they don't got apples.

09:26.271 --> 09:28.873
I don't eat your
american fast food.

09:28.906 --> 09:30.309
What's my total?

09:30.342 --> 09:32.845
One
moment, please.

09:32.877 --> 09:35.948
So, Nathan, man, how come
you don't eat fast food?

09:35.980 --> 09:36.849
Do you know the
cholesterol level

09:36.882 --> 09:38.883
in just those fries alone?

09:38.916 --> 09:40.886
What about that Double
Beef 'N' Cheese?

09:40.919 --> 09:42.353
All that stuff does is
clog up your arteries

09:42.387 --> 09:44.223
and slows down your metabolism.

09:44.256 --> 09:46.826
That's how people become fat.

09:50.228 --> 09:53.898
First of all, I'm not fat,
I'm slightly overweight.

09:53.931 --> 09:56.568
You can just kiss my grits.

09:56.602 --> 09:59.538
Yo, supersize that
Number Two for me!

09:59.570 --> 10:02.207
That'll be
14.72 at the 2nd window.

10:10.114 --> 10:13.018
This is so good.

10:15.020 --> 10:17.256
Listen to them
arteries hardenin'.

10:18.956 --> 10:22.126
Feel that metabolism
bein' lubricated.

10:24.662 --> 10:26.865
Why are we still here?

10:26.898 --> 10:28.267
Because we haven't left.

10:29.901 --> 10:32.872
So, Nathan, man, what kind
of cop are you in Thailand?

10:32.905 --> 10:35.174
Well it's the
equivalent of the FBI.

10:35.206 --> 10:37.041
You know, I really
thought about goin' federal.

10:37.075 --> 10:39.612
Me, too, man, but all
that physical trainin'.

10:39.645 --> 10:41.380
Please.

10:41.412 --> 10:44.249
So, Nathan, what's
so classified?

10:44.282 --> 10:46.318
Well the man you're after
is no ordinary killer.

10:47.920 --> 10:50.955
Well we ain't ordinary cops.

10:50.988 --> 10:52.624
Well, I'm kinda ordinary.

10:52.657 --> 10:54.926
See, ordinary ain't gonna
cut it for the feds, man,

10:54.959 --> 10:57.396
'cause you gotta be, like, cool.

10:57.429 --> 10:58.898
FBI!

11:00.299 --> 11:01.400
FBI.

11:02.099 --> 11:04.369
F-B-I.
Can we go now?

11:04.402 --> 11:06.938
First, I gotta go
release some hostages.

11:08.006 --> 11:09.242
Where are you goin'?

11:11.243 --> 11:12.377
Classified.

11:13.645 --> 11:15.248
Where's he goin'?

11:17.349 --> 11:18.450
Take a poop.

11:18.483 --> 11:19.919
Can you hurry up?

11:19.951 --> 11:22.921
No, no, no,
listen, come on, man.

11:22.954 --> 11:25.623
When Nick's gotta
go, Nick's gotta go.

11:25.656 --> 11:28.259
Besides, ain't
nothin' in the world

11:28.292 --> 11:30.228
more important than
takin' a good poop.

11:39.371 --> 11:43.909
Did you see that?

11:47.979 --> 11:51.115
I got a possible 2-11
at a Stop 'N' Go Minmart

11:51.148 --> 11:53.151
on the corner of
105 and Abaline.

11:53.185 --> 11:54.152
Open the register!

11:54.185 --> 11:55.119
No!

11:55.152 --> 11:56.454
Open the register!

11:56.488 --> 11:58.023
Aren't you gonna do somethin'?

11:59.291 --> 12:01.026
First of all,
I'm still hungry.

12:01.059 --> 12:03.195
Second, I just did.

12:03.228 --> 12:04.662
Aren't you gonna
do something else?

12:04.695 --> 12:05.464
Come on, go, go!

12:07.099 --> 12:08.733
Open this register!

12:08.767 --> 12:11.402
Listen I work for the LAPD.

12:11.435 --> 12:13.104
You know what that stands for?

12:13.137 --> 12:15.206
Leave the African People Dead.

12:15.239 --> 12:16.374
When them white cops show up,

12:16.407 --> 12:18.978
all they see is a
black man with a gun.

12:19.011 --> 12:20.713
So unless I hear shots fired.

12:24.516 --> 12:25.985
Open the register!

12:26.017 --> 12:27.652
No, no, no, no open.

12:27.685 --> 12:28.320
Shots fired, shots fired

12:28.353 --> 12:30.189
at 2-11, Stop 'N' Go Minimart

12:30.222 --> 12:32.358
on the corner of
105 and Abaline.

12:32.391 --> 12:33.692
Open
the damn register!

12:33.724 --> 12:35.127
No, no, no open!

12:35.160 --> 12:36.728
You can't touch that, no open!

12:36.762 --> 12:37.997
What?

12:38.030 --> 12:39.098
Open the register!

12:40.799 --> 12:43.002
Open this register!

12:43.035 --> 12:44.236
Open the register!
No, no, no!

12:52.044 --> 12:53.713
Where's
the fuckin' money?

12:56.415 --> 12:59.284
James, James, I got
the money, let's go!

14:21.867 --> 14:23.435
Police! Freeze!

14:23.468 --> 14:24.837
Don't even think
about it, put it down.

14:24.869 --> 14:26.204
Put it down.

14:27.305 --> 14:28.574
Slowly.

14:28.607 --> 14:30.541
All right, stand up,
turn around, turn around!

14:30.575 --> 14:32.511
Put your hands behind your back.

14:32.544 --> 14:33.412
Slowly!

14:44.855 --> 14:47.258
Lady, I'm a cop,
put that gun down!

14:47.291 --> 14:48.660
I'm here to help you!

15:05.544 --> 15:08.413
Now hold on there
a minute, cowboy.

15:08.445 --> 15:10.648
Now I'm a cop.

15:10.681 --> 15:12.584
Now you don't wanna shoot a cop.

15:15.954 --> 15:18.457
Why don't we fight it out?

15:18.489 --> 15:20.592
You and me, man to man.

15:22.194 --> 15:23.329
Toe to toe.

15:24.695 --> 15:27.867
What you say, cowboy?

15:31.636 --> 15:34.272
I've always wanted
to kick a cop's ass.

15:36.241 --> 15:38.177
I got this.

16:02.300 --> 16:04.370
This milk is way past
its expiration date.

16:05.737 --> 16:06.905
I don't work here.

16:17.581 --> 16:19.650
Now this looks good.

16:19.684 --> 16:21.687
You're
about a stupid SOB.

16:21.719 --> 16:23.287
I don't work here.

16:23.320 --> 16:25.257
Listen, I'm a cop.

16:26.291 --> 16:28.227
You don't wanna shoot a cop.

16:28.259 --> 16:30.628
Why don't you and I
just fight it out?

16:30.661 --> 16:31.964
Toe to toe.

16:33.397 --> 16:34.666
What do you say, cowgirl?

16:35.767 --> 16:37.670
No thanks, I just ate.

16:40.772 --> 16:42.641
Toe to toe?

16:42.674 --> 16:43.943
You and me.

17:46.638 --> 17:50.007
You got the right
to shut the fuck up!

17:50.040 --> 17:51.375
And if you say
anything about this

17:51.409 --> 17:53.712
down at the department,
I'll kill ya.

17:53.745 --> 17:55.747
You know you made
me bump my head?

18:02.821 --> 18:04.823
What happened here?

18:04.855 --> 18:06.791
She snuck up behind me
and hit me in the head

18:06.825 --> 18:09.327
on a 1-11 gone bad and then,

18:09.361 --> 18:10.728
you know, Nathan, we
gotta do somethin'.

18:10.761 --> 18:13.531
He, he got all in the
way and everything.

18:13.565 --> 18:15.633
But I made the arrest by myself.

18:25.709 --> 18:32.684
So what's up at
the Osaki School?

18:36.888 --> 18:38.757
What, what are you doin'?

18:41.526 --> 18:43.362
What are you doin'?

18:43.394 --> 18:44.662
What are you doin'?

18:44.696 --> 18:46.498
Guys, this is urgent.

18:46.530 --> 18:47.765
Urgent.

18:47.798 --> 18:51.769
I mean, what
exactly is "urgent."

18:51.803 --> 18:55.707
Urgent, the calling
for immediate attention.

18:55.739 --> 18:58.410
Immediate attention
with haste, isn't it?

18:59.677 --> 19:01.513
You really did graduate.

19:01.546 --> 19:02.713
Told ya.

19:02.747 --> 19:04.382
Guys, can we hurry up?

19:04.415 --> 19:05.883
I get it.

19:05.917 --> 19:08.153
This is just cereal to you.

19:08.186 --> 19:09.654
But Samoto's on a quest.

19:09.687 --> 19:10.921
Samoto?

19:10.955 --> 19:12.691
Who's Samoto?

19:13.924 --> 19:16.127
Come on, Nathan,
lips don't fail me now.

19:17.461 --> 19:19.564
All right, what I'm
about to tell you guys

19:19.596 --> 19:20.865
is absolutely classified.

19:20.899 --> 19:23.468
I get it, so this
is the part where you say,

19:23.500 --> 19:26.504
"I can tell you, but then
I'll have to kill ya."

19:26.537 --> 19:28.906
The killer name
is Samoto Kanami.

19:28.940 --> 19:31.176
Samoto Kanami, how
do you spell Kanami?

19:31.209 --> 19:34.946
K-E-Nami,

19:34.978 --> 19:36.614
shit, I don't know, man.

19:36.648 --> 19:37.749
I flunked math.

19:37.782 --> 19:38.583
All
cars in the vicinity

19:38.615 --> 19:40.551
of Olympic and
Broadway, we have a 197

19:40.584 --> 19:42.688
reported at the Osaki
Martial Arts School.

19:43.921 --> 19:45.824
12-Henry-6 responding.

19:51.696 --> 19:53.465
You think you
can get any prints off this?

19:53.498 --> 19:54.632
Yeah,
shouldn't be a problem.

19:54.665 --> 19:56.717
There's some fresh ones
around inside there.

19:56.718 --> 19:59.438
Well, let's
hope they're our guys.

19:59.470 --> 20:00.439
Keep dusting.

20:02.841 --> 20:05.511
Ancient japanese
symbol of power.

20:08.712 --> 20:09.847
Get everything out
as soon as you can.

20:09.881 --> 20:11.917
We got hardly anything
to go on here.

20:13.918 --> 20:16.488
What were you two doin'
dickin' around a minimart?

20:16.520 --> 20:17.221
We just had to get...

20:17.255 --> 20:18.723
Listen.

20:18.756 --> 20:21.226
Has Nathan shared any
pertinent info with you yet?

20:21.258 --> 20:23.661
Well, he.

20:27.030 --> 20:28.800
Where is Nathan?

20:35.006 --> 20:37.843
I want a tight perimeter
around this building now!

20:38.809 --> 20:40.878
You two, lock down.

20:40.911 --> 20:42.747
The four of you check it out.

21:45.843 --> 21:47.879
Jesus, you nearly scared
the piss outta me!

22:23.881 --> 22:25.284
Jesus!

22:39.764 --> 22:41.065
No!

22:41.098 --> 22:42.700
No!

22:42.734 --> 22:43.669
Dad!

22:44.701 --> 22:45.570
Jesus.

22:46.403 --> 22:48.839
Jesus, get an ambulance!

22:48.873 --> 22:49.940
God, Dad.

22:49.973 --> 22:50.908
Secure this area!

22:50.941 --> 22:52.611
Get an ambulance!

22:52.643 --> 22:54.845
We'll get you outta here.

22:54.879 --> 23:01.753
It's gonna be okay,
it's gonna be okay.

23:15.767 --> 23:16.802
Excuse me.

23:18.068 --> 23:20.104
I'm very sorry.

23:28.211 --> 23:31.048
Is there not a decent
bone left in your body?

23:31.082 --> 23:33.418
Despite what you think,

23:33.450 --> 23:35.053
I loved and respected him.

23:35.085 --> 23:36.720
He was a good man.

23:36.754 --> 23:37.856
Respected him to the
point where you splattered

23:37.889 --> 23:39.791
his body all over the news?

23:39.824 --> 23:40.892
It's the beast.

23:43.061 --> 23:46.131
And then you leave
Nick standing at the altar.

23:49.467 --> 23:52.671
Nathan Nett boarded a plane
out of Mexico this morning.

23:54.771 --> 23:58.142
This will help you find him.

24:08.151 --> 24:09.688
I'm sure everything
will work out.

24:09.720 --> 24:11.789
I'm sure, too, thank you.

24:11.823 --> 24:14.126
Thank you for coming out.

24:17.894 --> 24:20.731
Your father was a good
man and a damned good cop.

24:21.865 --> 24:24.102
It's simple, like he wanted.

24:24.134 --> 24:26.171
Thank you for
understanding, sir.

24:26.203 --> 24:28.005
I think you two should
take some time off.

24:28.038 --> 24:29.773
Thank you, sir, that
won't be necessary.

24:29.806 --> 24:31.108
My brother and I
would like some time off

24:31.142 --> 24:32.209
to grieve, sir.

24:33.745 --> 24:35.147
Shall we say indefinite?

24:36.279 --> 24:42.119
Definitely, sir.

25:15.253 --> 25:16.921
It is hot.

25:16.953 --> 25:19.190
Man, I feel like a cup
of McDonald's coffee.

25:20.924 --> 25:22.259
You want taxi?

25:22.293 --> 25:25.630
Hell yeah I want
taxi, with ice.

25:29.499 --> 25:30.934
Hey, be careful with that.

25:30.968 --> 25:32.804
That's real imitation Gucci.

25:35.506 --> 25:37.275
Man, what's this?

25:37.307 --> 25:38.209
Taxi.

25:39.242 --> 25:40.845
It's not gonna fit.

25:42.180 --> 25:43.914
Taxi.

25:43.948 --> 25:47.953
Hell nah, man, I ain't
gettin' into no tricycle.

25:52.222 --> 25:54.091
Nick, just listen, okay?

25:54.124 --> 25:56.894
You can call it intuition.

25:56.928 --> 25:58.963
But I know how these
foreign countries work.

25:58.996 --> 26:00.965
So you just, just sit back

26:00.998 --> 26:03.168
and let me ask
all the questions.

26:04.199 --> 26:04.835
I got this.

27:58.950 --> 28:00.684
Why you here?

28:00.718 --> 28:03.187
It's obvious you
had the spicy onions.

28:07.024 --> 28:08.660
Dude, your breath stink.

28:09.660 --> 28:11.963
I mean, I bet when you
walk past toothpaste,

28:11.996 --> 28:13.098
it trembles.

28:14.398 --> 28:17.936
That's enough.

28:30.213 --> 28:31.715
Why'd you do it?

28:31.748 --> 28:32.650
I didn't.

28:32.683 --> 28:34.985
Before my father died,
he spoke your name.

28:35.018 --> 28:37.255
That may be so, but I never
would've killed my own father.

28:40.725 --> 28:42.226
During the Vietnam
conflict, my mother

28:42.258 --> 28:44.728
fell in love with a young GI.

28:44.761 --> 28:46.029
He didn't know she was pregnant.

28:46.063 --> 28:47.966
She didn't know he was TDY.

28:47.998 --> 28:49.132
What's TDY?

28:49.165 --> 28:50.969
Temporary duty assignment.

28:51.001 --> 28:53.370
He never knew about me and
I never knew about him.

28:53.403 --> 28:54.404
And even though I never met him,

28:54.439 --> 28:58.142
I always loved him and I
never would've killed him.

28:58.174 --> 29:00.478
That's very touching
but I lost my father

29:00.510 --> 29:02.346
and if you think I traveled
halfway around the world

29:02.380 --> 29:04.149
just to hear a pretty speech.

29:22.132 --> 29:24.201
This is personal.

29:24.235 --> 29:26.004
You bet your ass it is.

29:27.771 --> 29:31.141
All this may be tragic
but it still proves nothing.

29:33.044 --> 29:34.211
Come with me.

30:15.251 --> 30:17.055
You two wait right here.

30:21.225 --> 30:24.195
And don't touch anything.

30:38.342 --> 30:42.247
He said don't touch anything.

31:12.276 --> 31:13.344
Yo, Pops.

31:17.448 --> 31:23.621
Yo, Pops.

31:27.624 --> 31:30.894
Yo, you know Nathan,
black guy about,

31:30.928 --> 31:32.396
little taller than you.

31:32.429 --> 31:33.531
In your house, man.

31:33.564 --> 31:35.333
I mean, I hope you know him.

31:35.365 --> 31:37.167
Might have your TV by now.

31:38.568 --> 31:40.571
And he knocked
down your swords, too.

32:58.315 --> 33:00.651
So Papa was a rollin'
stone with jungle fever.

33:04.587 --> 33:07.691
He spoke to me of
his pain, of his guilt,

33:07.725 --> 33:10.661
of your mom's depression
when she found out.

33:10.693 --> 33:13.363
Of his failure of being a man.

33:13.396 --> 33:15.666
His failure of his
relationship with his son.

33:17.668 --> 33:19.938
He made me swear to
never say anything.

33:21.505 --> 33:22.707
Why couldn't he
just talk to me?

33:22.739 --> 33:24.709
He tried, Nick.

33:24.741 --> 33:27.344
Many times, he tried.

33:27.378 --> 33:29.680
Well not hard enough it seems.

33:29.712 --> 33:32.415
Can you all see that
we've been cheated?

33:32.449 --> 33:34.552
My mom, your mom.

33:34.584 --> 33:38.590
What Pops did was wrong,
and I hate him for it.

34:10.587 --> 34:11.522
Come with me.

34:12.723 --> 34:15.393
Someplace safe.

34:18.795 --> 34:24.467
We've lost many in this
battle, I hate to lose you, too.

37:06.497 --> 37:07.730
You two
wait right here.

37:07.763 --> 37:09.732
Yeah right.

37:09.765 --> 37:11.768
Look, here we
play by my rules.

37:11.801 --> 37:13.671
I call the shots.

37:13.703 --> 37:14.738
Where are we goin'?

37:14.770 --> 37:17.774
To a club.

37:29.520 --> 37:30.921
Damn!

37:30.953 --> 37:35.493
Um, um, um, hey!

37:36.660 --> 37:38.228
This what I'm talkin' 'bout!

37:38.261 --> 37:40.698
You act like you've
never seen a woman before.

37:40.730 --> 37:42.765
Well I ain't never
seen her before.

37:42.799 --> 37:44.802
And I ain't never seen her.

37:44.835 --> 37:47.805
And I just ran into
that one over there.

37:47.837 --> 37:49.672
Yeah, um!

37:49.705 --> 37:50.774
Well make yourselves
comfortable.

37:50.806 --> 37:52.576
I need to go talk to somebody.

37:54.310 --> 37:55.680
Damn!

37:58.614 --> 38:00.484
Ho, damn!

38:01.250 --> 38:03.053
Girl, you so fine,
just give me one number

38:03.085 --> 38:05.788
and I'll pick out the other six.

38:05.821 --> 38:07.590
I think she likes me.

38:07.623 --> 38:09.627
Yeah, you and all
your dead presidents.

38:17.834 --> 38:19.036
Can I get you a drink?

38:19.069 --> 38:21.971
Yes you can,
I'm havin' a Diet Coke

38:22.004 --> 38:23.740
and he's drinkin' Hatorade.

38:25.975 --> 38:26.877
Yes.

38:28.879 --> 38:31.815
Damn!

38:36.053 --> 38:39.991
Bend over, pick it up.

38:48.332 --> 38:49.799
This isn't funny.

38:52.602 --> 38:57.007
-Don't you love me?
-No, I don't love you.

38:57.040 --> 38:58.910
Okay, bye.

39:00.676 --> 39:03.948
-Still breakin' hearts.
-Whatever.

39:12.689 --> 39:14.692
How low can you go?

39:14.725 --> 39:16.860
How low can you go?

39:16.893 --> 39:18.762
How low can you go?

39:18.794 --> 39:20.830
How low can you go?

39:20.864 --> 39:22.900
How low can you go?

39:22.933 --> 39:25.035
How low can you go?

39:25.067 --> 39:26.870
How low can you go?

39:38.649 --> 39:40.384
How low can you go?

39:40.417 --> 39:42.652
How low can you go?

39:42.685 --> 39:44.721
How low can you go?

39:44.754 --> 39:46.756
How low can you go?

39:46.790 --> 39:47.891
How low can you go?

39:47.924 --> 39:50.828
-What'd you find out?
-Nothing.

39:50.861 --> 39:52.063
Can we go?

39:55.899 --> 39:58.801
Say, baby,
what's your name?

39:58.835 --> 40:00.037
Baby.

40:00.069 --> 40:02.038
Well that's easy.

40:02.071 --> 40:03.673
Okay, here.

40:04.975 --> 40:06.777
Not this one, I'm gonna
give you the big one.

40:06.810 --> 40:08.779
Okay, the big one.

40:08.812 --> 40:10.714
Here, that's the
big one right there.

40:10.747 --> 40:13.783
There you go.

40:17.988 --> 40:19.690
I gots to go.

40:48.951 --> 40:51.855
Nothing yet, but
the killer is here.

40:53.122 --> 40:54.891
I'll have more by deadline.

40:56.727 --> 40:57.862
Local to network.

41:01.864 --> 41:03.000
Excuse me.

41:03.033 --> 41:05.201
Get your feet off my
photos and off my desk.

41:05.234 --> 41:06.469
I'm so...

41:06.502 --> 41:07.904
Yeah, I know.

41:07.937 --> 41:09.038
Sorry.

41:09.071 --> 41:10.907
Damn, y'all let
anybody in this country.

41:12.274 --> 41:14.110
What are you doing here?

41:15.745 --> 41:17.714
Same reason you're here.

41:17.747 --> 41:18.781
Is she with you?

41:18.814 --> 41:20.216
-No!
-No!

41:20.250 --> 41:21.819
You know, you are incredible.

41:21.852 --> 41:22.786
After all that you've done.

41:22.819 --> 41:23.987
After all that I've done?

41:24.020 --> 41:26.123
If it wasn't for me, you
wouldn't even be here.

41:26.156 --> 41:27.825
How you figure?

41:29.091 --> 41:31.027
I gave you the file on Nathan.

41:35.297 --> 41:37.033
Didn't Jack tell you?

41:39.268 --> 41:41.104
Didn't you tell him?

41:43.806 --> 41:45.442
Intuition my ass!

41:49.011 --> 41:50.279
Okay, so what?

41:50.312 --> 41:51.881
So you helped out a
little bit, so what?

41:51.915 --> 41:53.817
You're not wanted here.

41:53.850 --> 41:57.020
If you expect to catch
this killer, you need me.

41:57.053 --> 41:59.022
This man is a Weirding warrior,

41:59.055 --> 42:00.890
a trained assassin.

42:00.924 --> 42:02.793
Weirding warrior?

42:02.826 --> 42:04.862
Yeah, they were a
secret society of japanese

42:04.895 --> 42:06.797
that migrated throughout
Asia and America

42:06.830 --> 42:08.498
after World War II.

42:08.531 --> 42:10.933
Weirding, weirding, weirding?

42:10.966 --> 42:11.934
Weirding murders?

42:11.968 --> 42:13.770
Weirding murderers.

42:13.803 --> 42:15.271
How did you find
out about this?

42:15.305 --> 42:16.940
On the Internet.

42:19.509 --> 42:21.844
I just don't know
what the scrolls are.

42:21.877 --> 42:22.779
Scrolls?

42:22.812 --> 42:24.280
Yes, scrolls, don't you know?

42:24.314 --> 42:26.183
This guy's not killing
out of vengeance,

42:26.216 --> 42:28.786
he's also after these
so-called sacred scrolls.

42:28.819 --> 42:29.520
That's enough.

42:29.553 --> 42:30.554
No, please continue!

42:30.587 --> 42:31.855
No.

42:31.888 --> 42:34.825
What else are
you not tellin' us?

42:38.895 --> 42:41.864
Samoto's after the
Kuji Den-dro scrolls.

42:41.897 --> 42:44.267
The Cujo Benji what?

42:44.301 --> 42:46.003
The Kuji Den-dro scrolls.

42:46.035 --> 42:48.204
What is so special
about these scrolls?

42:48.238 --> 42:50.140
These scrolls hold
thousands of years

42:50.172 --> 42:52.341
of laws and secrets
of the Weirding clan.

42:52.375 --> 42:54.344
They're a Weirding
warrior's birthright.

42:54.377 --> 42:55.512
They're said to
have been authored

42:55.544 --> 42:57.213
even before the birth of Christ.

42:57.247 --> 42:59.216
And they're like blueprints

42:59.248 --> 43:01.884
detailing the flawless
subtraction of life.

43:01.917 --> 43:04.020
A how-to book of murder.

43:04.053 --> 43:07.890
Pure, sacred convictions
so intense became sacred.

43:07.924 --> 43:11.027
But I've yet to find out exactly
how many scrolls there are.

43:11.060 --> 43:12.829
I've read that there
are six scrolls,

43:12.863 --> 43:15.332
but I've only found
reference to four.

43:15.364 --> 43:16.933
You've been holdin' out
on us this whole time.

43:16.966 --> 43:18.000
No, I haven't.

43:18.033 --> 43:20.102
Then what do you call it?

43:20.136 --> 43:22.907
Family, we ain't
even almost related.

43:25.007 --> 43:27.611
After Samoto's father
died, the remaining governors

43:27.643 --> 43:29.178
decide to disband.

43:29.212 --> 43:31.882
So they split up the scrolls
and fled the country.

43:31.915 --> 43:33.116
Some went to the Philippines.

43:33.149 --> 43:34.151
Some went to Thailand.

43:34.183 --> 43:35.852
Some went to the USA.

43:35.886 --> 43:37.888
But there were six governors
and only four scrolls

43:37.921 --> 43:39.256
and no one knows
who the other two

43:39.288 --> 43:42.124
keepers of the scrolls are.

43:42.158 --> 43:43.293
Would you have believed me

43:43.326 --> 43:44.261
if I would've come with
you in the beginning

43:44.294 --> 43:46.897
with a story like this?

43:46.930 --> 43:50.234
You two still think
I killed my father.

43:50.267 --> 43:51.401
I was just waiting
for the right moment

43:51.433 --> 43:53.903
to explain it all
in full detail.

43:53.937 --> 43:56.006
But first I felt I had
to gain your trust.

43:57.239 --> 43:58.375
I have a
description of the guy

43:58.408 --> 43:59.910
that may help lead
us to the killer.

44:01.977 --> 44:03.880
I have an address.

44:03.913 --> 44:04.948
Give it.

44:04.980 --> 44:05.948
-I go with?
-No!

44:05.982 --> 44:07.017
-No!
-No!

44:07.049 --> 44:09.986
I want this story,
I need this story!

44:10.020 --> 44:11.321
If I'm ever going to
make national news,

44:11.353 --> 44:13.323
I need this story!

44:13.355 --> 44:14.892
-No.
-No.

44:29.105 --> 44:30.974
You gonna eat that?

44:31.006 --> 44:32.008
No.

44:35.678 --> 44:37.914
I don't know how you can
eat all that saturated fat

44:37.948 --> 44:39.250
and expect to live long.

44:41.017 --> 44:44.087
It is not what you
eat, but what you keep.

44:44.120 --> 44:47.958
All this goin' out tomorrow.

44:52.161 --> 44:53.430
This ain't diet.

44:53.462 --> 44:55.265
I ordered diet.

44:59.002 --> 45:01.103
Same shit, different country.

45:01.136 --> 45:03.673
My
Stomach, I don't feel well.

45:07.243 --> 45:11.015
Take a hit of this.

45:15.118 --> 45:16.719
Smells like bubblegum.

45:16.752 --> 45:18.154
Well give it back.

45:20.022 --> 45:21.158
'Cause the last thing we need

45:21.190 --> 45:26.363
is your ass blowin' bubbles.

45:30.734 --> 45:32.136
Here we go.

45:34.404 --> 45:35.439
Stay.

46:00.263 --> 46:01.998
Hey, big guy, how ya doin'?

46:19.049 --> 46:20.384
Can I play?

46:20.417 --> 46:23.286
Show off.

46:28.058 --> 46:28.792
Stay back!

46:28.825 --> 46:30.227
You stay back!

46:31.560 --> 46:33.296
She die!

46:33.328 --> 46:34.731
Stay back!

46:36.332 --> 46:39.036
Man, she die!

46:43.372 --> 46:44.307
Hey!

46:46.408 --> 46:47.477
Stay back!

46:55.484 --> 46:56.419
Go!

47:00.223 --> 47:01.491
Stay back!

47:03.560 --> 47:04.795
Not in Thailand.

47:06.495 --> 47:08.764
Hey, hey, hey!

47:08.797 --> 47:11.100
Mister.

47:31.855 --> 47:33.824
Hey, Hey!

47:36.125 --> 47:38.062
Go, go!

50:49.852 --> 50:51.721
All right, get down, drop it!

50:51.754 --> 50:57.294
Drop it, drop it.

51:01.464 --> 51:04.468
Put it down, put it down.

51:31.727 --> 51:33.395
For what it's worth,

51:33.428 --> 51:34.863
I just wanna thank you.

51:34.897 --> 51:36.433
For what?

51:36.466 --> 51:38.768
For saving my life.

51:38.801 --> 51:40.469
Don't mention it.

51:40.502 --> 51:41.771
Look, about.

51:45.774 --> 51:47.510
About what?

51:49.145 --> 51:52.482
Maybe we could talk about
"what" over dinner tonight.

51:52.515 --> 51:53.549
My treat.

51:57.620 --> 51:59.422
I don't think
that's a good idea.

52:01.524 --> 52:03.794
I'm just not ready.

52:07.897 --> 52:10.067
Lemme hail you a cab.

52:40.730 --> 52:42.732
So how's Karen?

52:42.765 --> 52:44.167
She's all right.

52:44.200 --> 52:46.770
Little bit shaken,
but otherwise okay.

52:47.904 --> 52:50.741
I, sent her to
her hotel in a taxi.

52:54.710 --> 52:56.446
Anything?

52:56.478 --> 52:58.415
No, he hasn't said anything.

52:58.448 --> 52:59.716
Why won't he say anything?

52:59.748 --> 53:01.484
Because he'd lose face.

53:03.453 --> 53:04.788
You mean hit.

53:08.890 --> 53:10.159
Try to get some rest.

53:10.192 --> 53:15.698
We've got a big day tomorrow.

53:19.868 --> 53:21.970
Listen, man, there's, um,

53:22.004 --> 53:24.107
somethin' I gotta do.

53:24.140 --> 53:24.973
Um.

53:25.006 --> 53:27.176
Yeah, I'm sure.

53:27.210 --> 53:28.478
Don't wait up for me.

53:28.511 --> 53:29.746
Like I would.

53:37.652 --> 53:38.587
Yes!

57:02.792 --> 57:03.860
Who is it?

57:20.042 --> 57:21.810
Twice in one day?

57:21.843 --> 57:22.878
I'm sorry.

57:24.480 --> 57:26.149
What is this?

57:26.181 --> 57:32.788
Thought I'd bring
dinner to you.

57:37.158 --> 57:40.930
What is this?

57:45.468 --> 57:49.839
What is this?

57:53.808 --> 57:55.812
I must've thought
about this 1,000 times.

57:57.913 --> 58:00.116
What I was gonna say.

58:00.149 --> 58:01.718
What I was gonna do.

58:03.518 --> 58:04.921
And now that you're here.

58:06.522 --> 58:09.192
You say that you love me,

58:09.225 --> 58:11.127
yet you wanna change
me at every turn.

58:13.129 --> 58:14.864
What's wrong with who I am?

58:16.899 --> 58:18.902
I don't know, Karen, what
is wrong with who you are?

58:21.069 --> 58:23.739
This is who I am, Nick.

58:23.772 --> 58:26.007
I love my life, I love my job,

58:26.040 --> 58:27.810
I love where I'm
at in my career.

58:30.879 --> 58:31.948
Walls of Jericho?

58:33.149 --> 58:34.817
Can we just be
friends tonight?

58:48.062 --> 58:49.097
Sorry.

58:49.131 --> 58:50.734
It's okay.

58:51.834 --> 58:53.803
Nathan's waiting in the lobby.

58:54.803 --> 58:56.805
Um, one more thing.

58:56.839 --> 58:58.942
Remember when we talked
about the scrolls?

59:00.209 --> 59:03.546
Um, supposedly he who
possesses all six scrolls

59:03.578 --> 59:05.848
can summon special powers.

59:06.948 --> 59:10.185
No, not the special powers.

59:10.218 --> 59:11.553
What do you mean?

59:11.587 --> 59:13.189
What kind of special powers?

59:13.221 --> 59:15.091
I don't know, I'm
still researching,

59:15.123 --> 59:17.993
but supposedly he who
possesses all six scrolls

59:18.027 --> 59:20.329
can summon special powers.

59:20.361 --> 59:23.767
Powers that can heal whole
villages of sick people.

59:24.834 --> 59:27.136
Arrest natural catstrophes.

59:27.169 --> 59:29.839
Where there's famine, the
scrolls can bring feast.

59:29.872 --> 59:32.942
Where there's drought, the
scrolls can bring rain.

59:32.975 --> 59:34.911
I mean, it's pretty incredible.

59:36.044 --> 59:39.881
So more motivation for
Samoto to acquire the scrolls.

59:39.915 --> 59:40.984
Or Nathan.

59:42.951 --> 59:45.254
Can these scrolls,

59:45.286 --> 59:46.855
give you the lotto numbers?

59:54.897 --> 59:57.232
Man, I ain't gonna never
complain about Section 8 again.

59:57.265 --> 59:59.868
What's Section 8?

59:59.902 --> 01:00:01.904
Ain't no middle
class here?

01:00:01.937 --> 01:00:03.839
Either you extremely rich.

01:00:03.872 --> 01:00:04.973
Or extremely poor.

01:00:05.006 --> 01:00:06.107
Remember, when you're a kid,

01:00:06.140 --> 01:00:07.843
you're not worried
about being poor.

01:00:07.877 --> 01:00:08.978
You're just havin' fun.

01:00:09.011 --> 01:00:10.046
I guess.

01:00:10.078 --> 01:00:11.180
What's funny
about you Westerners

01:00:11.212 --> 01:00:12.948
is you always come
to what you consider

01:00:12.982 --> 01:00:15.284
a Third World country and try
to impose your way of life.

01:00:15.317 --> 01:00:17.219
The truth is, it's
country's just like yours

01:00:17.252 --> 01:00:18.353
that are responsible
for using up

01:00:18.386 --> 01:00:20.589
most of the world's resources.

01:00:20.622 --> 01:00:21.923
How you figure?

01:00:21.957 --> 01:00:22.825
Well, according
to your own EPA,

01:00:22.857 --> 01:00:24.993
America's only 6% of
the world's population

01:00:25.027 --> 01:00:27.930
but yet you generate
50% of the annual waste.

01:00:27.962 --> 01:00:30.131
Yeah, well, you know what?

01:00:30.165 --> 01:00:33.236
I'd rather generate 50% of
the waste bein' comfortable

01:00:33.268 --> 01:00:35.203
than takin' a shower in a cup.

01:00:35.236 --> 01:00:38.273
Yeah, that's it,
the old american spirit.

01:02:48.770 --> 01:02:50.406
Took long enough.

01:02:50.439 --> 01:02:51.774
What is this place?

01:02:51.806 --> 01:02:53.341
It's an abandoned
chinese temple.

01:02:53.375 --> 01:02:55.378
The Weirding clan used to
have their ceremonies here.

01:02:55.410 --> 01:02:56.711
Used to?

01:02:56.745 --> 01:02:58.013
Yeah, until
about 10 years ago,

01:02:58.047 --> 01:02:59.382
until they decided to go legit.

01:03:42.825 --> 01:03:44.460
Used to?

01:03:44.493 --> 01:03:46.062
Yeah.

01:03:46.861 --> 01:03:48.763
Yeah, well,
somebody ain't...

01:03:48.797 --> 01:03:49.766
No!

01:03:51.100 --> 01:03:52.435
Don't move!

01:03:52.468 --> 01:03:53.402
Get rid of the shoe.

01:03:53.435 --> 01:03:55.137
Man, these $200 shoes!

01:03:55.169 --> 01:03:56.538
This dart has been
chemically treated.

01:03:56.571 --> 01:03:58.473
It'll burn through your
soles, eat through your skin,

01:03:58.506 --> 01:04:04.546
pierce your body, and
make your heart explode.

01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:12.321
Hello?

01:04:13.555 --> 01:04:14.857
Poison gas, run!

01:04:40.415 --> 01:04:41.817
I have a new girl.

01:05:14.649 --> 01:05:15.852
Anything?

01:05:17.718 --> 01:05:20.155
Might as well make
yourselves comfortable.

01:05:20.189 --> 01:05:21.524
It's gonna be a long night.

01:08:57.537 --> 01:08:58.639
You okay?

01:08:58.671 --> 01:09:00.041
I saw him, we
were face to face!

01:09:00.075 --> 01:09:00.908
You okay?

01:09:00.942 --> 01:09:01.844
But I saw him.

01:09:01.876 --> 01:09:03.511
Listen, honey, calm down.

01:09:03.545 --> 01:09:06.549
I won't be a victim!

01:09:28.870 --> 01:09:30.406
Notice anything?

01:09:31.706 --> 01:09:33.841
You mean besides
the dead body?

01:09:33.875 --> 01:09:36.412
No one's been
decapitated or skinned.

01:09:39.514 --> 01:09:43.519
Samoto didn't get
what he came for.

01:09:51.693 --> 01:09:53.694
Shotoro's destroyed the scroll.

01:09:53.728 --> 01:09:54.730
So what does that mean?

01:09:54.763 --> 01:09:56.799
It means the scroll lives.

01:09:56.831 --> 01:09:59.535
How the hell a scroll live?

01:09:59.568 --> 01:10:00.703
In human skin.

01:10:02.604 --> 01:10:05.507
It was transferred to

01:10:05.540 --> 01:10:06.742
Tiku.

01:10:06.774 --> 01:10:08.143
His name's Tieku.

01:10:08.175 --> 01:10:09.477
Yeah.

01:10:09.510 --> 01:10:10.778
-Let's go.
-To where?

01:10:10.812 --> 01:10:11.747
The station.

01:10:11.779 --> 01:10:13.782
If Tiku's been scrolled,
he'll go into hiding.

01:10:13.814 --> 01:10:18.888
That's the only place
he knows to contact me.

01:10:23.224 --> 01:10:26.861
Listen, I need a favor.

01:10:26.894 --> 01:10:28.596
My girl's really freakin' out.

01:10:28.630 --> 01:10:29.598
Do you mind if she...

01:10:29.630 --> 01:10:31.732
She can stay with me.

01:10:31.765 --> 01:10:34.670
Thanks, I owe you.

01:10:34.702 --> 01:10:36.772
You owe everybody.

01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:48.716
Make sure those two
get home safely, okay.

01:10:48.750 --> 01:10:50.752
Okay.

01:11:22.951 --> 01:11:24.520
It's okay.

01:11:24.553 --> 01:11:25.520
Thanks.

01:11:25.554 --> 01:11:28.958
If I need you, I'll scream.

01:11:39.867 --> 01:11:41.703
Go ahead and make
yourself comfortable.

01:11:42.871 --> 01:11:47.743
I'm gonna take a long, hot bath.

01:11:51.979 --> 01:11:53.581
Are you cold?

01:11:54.683 --> 01:11:55.718
Here.

01:11:59.054 --> 01:12:04.960
Put this on.

01:12:09.598 --> 01:12:10.832
Don't mention it.

01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:15.904
I'm here if you need me.

01:12:19.873 --> 01:12:21.743
I can't just sit
here all night.

01:12:23.845 --> 01:12:25.281
Then make yourself useful.

01:12:46.768 --> 01:12:48.370
You hungry?

01:12:48.403 --> 01:12:49.705
That's a stupid question.

01:12:49.737 --> 01:12:50.838
What do you wanna eat?

01:12:51.906 --> 01:12:54.876
Well, any kind
of fried rice is cool.

01:12:56.044 --> 01:12:57.845
Long as it ain't no dog or cat.

01:13:01.782 --> 01:13:03.785
Well, he's got some of
your family qualities.

01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:01.743
Don't go in there until
I clean up all that glass.

01:14:01.776 --> 01:14:03.679
Stupid me, I dropped
my champagne glass.

01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:06.214
What's the matter?

01:14:06.246 --> 01:14:07.915
You don't like my music?

01:14:24.131 --> 01:14:24.965
Nick.

01:14:44.051 --> 01:14:47.188
I want you to stay in my
hotel until this is over.

01:14:47.221 --> 01:14:54.162
Okay.

01:14:58.832 --> 01:15:00.102
I'm so sorry.

01:15:01.269 --> 01:15:02.838
It's not your fault.

01:15:06.541 --> 01:15:08.810
I'm sorry.

01:15:08.843 --> 01:15:09.845
Yeah.

01:15:10.912 --> 01:15:12.214
Thanks.

01:15:12.246 --> 01:15:14.515
We can't seem to contact
any friends or family.

01:15:14.549 --> 01:15:15.751
Do you mind comin'
down to the station,

01:15:15.783 --> 01:15:17.185
fill out a report?

01:15:21.889 --> 01:15:22.924
No.

01:15:23.858 --> 01:15:25.894
I'll ride with you.

01:15:25.926 --> 01:15:27.196
That's okay, you.

01:15:28.929 --> 01:15:31.065
You go home with Karen,
I'll be all right.

01:15:54.188 --> 01:15:55.823
Yeah?

01:15:55.857 --> 01:15:57.091
Nathan!

01:15:59.093 --> 01:16:00.261
Yeah.

01:16:02.229 --> 01:16:04.098
Samoto's coming for me!

01:16:05.834 --> 01:16:07.068
Where are you?

01:16:07.100 --> 01:16:09.837
Meet me at temple on
top of the mountain!

01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:13.941
Temple?

01:16:15.042 --> 01:16:17.179
How do I, how do I get there?

01:16:37.297 --> 01:16:39.166
Yes, how
can I direct your call?

01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:41.368
Yeah, room 1-3-2 please.

01:16:41.402 --> 01:16:42.904
Thank you.

01:16:56.885 --> 01:16:58.887
That was supposed
to be me tonight.

01:17:03.190 --> 01:17:03.959
Nick?

01:17:08.028 --> 01:17:09.363
I have to tell you something.

01:17:14.001 --> 01:17:15.203
I wanted to be liked.

01:17:18.238 --> 01:17:22.243
I wanted the american
dream so bad.

01:17:32.287 --> 01:17:33.856
My parents aren't dead.

01:17:35.924 --> 01:17:37.259
Your parents are alive?

01:17:38.660 --> 01:17:42.898
Well, my mother is.

01:17:46.466 --> 01:17:49.004
But my father passed
away three months ago.

01:17:52.072 --> 01:17:53.241
I didn't even know.

01:17:56.944 --> 01:18:00.148
He asked my mother
not to tell me

01:18:00.180 --> 01:18:03.986
'cause he didn't wanna
bring anymore shame on me.

01:18:08.221 --> 01:18:10.959
I'm so sorry.

01:18:14.996 --> 01:18:17.632
I've traded
everything for this.

01:18:20.233 --> 01:18:21.636
I sold my soul.

01:18:23.438 --> 01:18:24.973
And for what?

01:18:28.376 --> 01:18:31.713
Maybe I should just pack
it all up and go home.

01:18:45.292 --> 01:18:46.361
Karen.

01:18:48.996 --> 01:18:50.064
You have to invest in here.

01:18:52.132 --> 01:18:53.969
This is your home.

01:18:57.537 --> 01:18:59.506
Do you think my
father could forgive me?

01:18:59.540 --> 01:19:01.143
I'm sure he would.

01:19:02.309 --> 01:19:07.014
Can you?

01:19:11.251 --> 01:19:12.254
Come here.

01:19:15.023 --> 01:19:16.690
I'm so sorry.

01:19:16.724 --> 01:19:17.759
It's okay.

01:19:28.736 --> 01:19:32.239
You have police
emergency message.

01:19:36.376 --> 01:19:37.711
Go to my room, lock the door,

01:19:37.745 --> 01:19:39.247
and don't open it for anyone.

01:22:13.233 --> 01:22:14.401
Dear Nick and Jack,

01:22:14.434 --> 01:22:17.237
I fear Tieku has
succumbed to his demise.

01:22:17.270 --> 01:22:19.506
With that, Samoto has
acquired all six scrolls

01:22:19.540 --> 01:22:21.576
and, therefore, must
complete the dance of Akita

01:22:21.608 --> 01:22:23.544
in the presence of
all six scrolls.

01:22:23.577 --> 01:22:25.312
This ritualistic
cadence commands

01:22:25.345 --> 01:22:27.314
the powers of the supernatural.

01:22:27.348 --> 01:22:29.184
His body will become like stone,

01:22:29.216 --> 01:22:31.219
his blood like sand.

01:22:31.251 --> 01:22:34.589
I cannot ask you for what
I, and I alone, must do.

01:22:34.621 --> 01:22:36.323
Forgive me. Nathan.

01:25:37.470 --> 01:25:39.406
You see what that
bastard keep doin'?

01:27:29.250 --> 01:27:31.719
Well, I
guess this is goodbye.

01:27:31.751 --> 01:27:32.986
Yep.

01:27:33.019 --> 01:27:34.721
See you around.

01:27:34.755 --> 01:27:36.491
'Fore you know it.

01:27:38.791 --> 01:27:40.527
So this is it.

01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:43.230
Well, I just wanna spend
more time with my mom.

01:27:43.264 --> 01:27:44.933
Got a lot of catching up to do.

01:27:46.032 --> 01:27:47.768
Well I hope things
work out for you.

01:27:49.870 --> 01:27:51.706
Close your eyes.

01:27:51.738 --> 01:27:52.806
Why?

01:27:52.840 --> 01:27:54.642
Close 'em.

01:27:54.675 --> 01:27:56.711
You know I don't
like surprises.

01:27:56.743 --> 01:27:58.746
Sounds familiar.

01:28:22.937 --> 01:28:24.805
What this?

01:28:24.837 --> 01:28:31.845
Nick, will you marry me?

01:28:32.305 --> 01:28:38.753
