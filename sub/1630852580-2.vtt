<i>Noah: "Give your dad the chance</i>
<i>to have an unexpected date</i>

00:10.510 --> 00:13.046
<i>with the mom of your choice."</i>

00:13.146 --> 00:16.716
<i>I would like for my dad to go</i>
<i>on a date with Karen, please.</i>

00:16.816 --> 00:18.518
<i>Alex: Yes!</i>

00:21.354 --> 00:23.490
<i>Jimmy better get in there, man.</i>
<i>He gotta hurry up.</i>

00:23.556 --> 00:25.492
<i>He's, like,</i>
<i>actually sleeping now.</i>

00:25.558 --> 00:28.328
It's so funny 'cause
he doesn't know we're
watching him right now.

00:28.395 --> 00:29.596
<i>There was, like,</i>
<i>a five-minute period</i>

00:29.696 --> 00:30.997
<i>where he was, like,</i>
<i>half awake,</i>

00:31.064 --> 00:33.433
<i>but now I think he might</i>
<i>actually be out cold.</i>

00:35.702 --> 00:37.003
<i>- Hey, Troy?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

00:37.070 --> 00:39.105
<i>- It's Jimmy.</i>
<i>- Hey, Jimmy.</i>

00:39.205 --> 00:41.775
<i>- Can I come in?</i>
<i>- Sure.</i>

00:41.875 --> 00:44.577
<i>So, Troy,</i>
<i>the dating consultants --</i>

00:44.677 --> 00:47.447
they didn't want you
to not have an experience,

00:47.547 --> 00:50.617
so they actually have
something special planned.

00:50.717 --> 00:52.452
<i>- Really?</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

00:52.552 --> 00:53.920
<i>All right. Let's go.</i>

00:54.020 --> 00:56.356
<i>Troy, why don't you</i>
<i>comb your hair a little bit?</i>

00:57.857 --> 01:00.693
Oh, my gosh.
What's about to happen?

01:00.760 --> 01:02.395
<i>- Oh!</i>
<i>- Oh!</i>

01:02.462 --> 01:04.564
<i>- Did they give them a room?</i>
<i>- Oh, my gosh.</i>

01:04.631 --> 01:06.766
<i>- That's what I'm wondering.</i>
<i>- Oh.</i>

01:06.866 --> 01:08.968
<i>- Oh, okay.</i>

01:09.069 --> 01:10.603
<i>But it's right next</i>
<i>to the bed, though.</i>

01:10.703 --> 01:12.539
<i>- On the balcony.</i>
<i>- Oh, thank you.</i>

01:12.605 --> 01:15.542
<i>And there's actually</i>
<i>one more surprise.</i>

01:15.608 --> 01:17.610
<i>I'll be right back.</i>

01:23.716 --> 01:24.984
- <i>Hey, Karen.</i>
<i>- Jimmy!</i>

01:25.085 --> 01:26.886
<i>Will you please</i>
<i>follow me?</i>

01:26.953 --> 01:27.987
<i>- Who, me?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

01:28.088 --> 01:29.722
<i>Oh, boy. </i>

01:29.789 --> 01:31.257
<i>Noah: Shit.</i>
<i>Sorry, Scott.</i>

01:31.324 --> 01:33.159
<i>- Scott!</i>
<i>- Sorry, buddy.</i>

01:33.259 --> 01:36.463
<i>- Bye, Karen.</i>
<i>- Hold tight. Drink another beer.</i>

01:40.633 --> 01:42.669
<i>- Hello.</i>
<i>- Hey.</i>

01:42.769 --> 01:45.171
<i>Wow! What's this?</i>

01:45.271 --> 01:46.439
<i>- Come on out.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

01:46.506 --> 01:48.441
<i>I think this is</i>
<i>obviously for us.</i>

01:48.508 --> 01:52.479
<i>Wow! I guess I'm not dateless</i>
<i>tonight, or at least completely.</i>

01:52.579 --> 01:55.348
<i>Oh.</i>
<i>Oh, you didn't plan this?</i>

01:55.448 --> 01:57.350
<i>- I wish I could say I did.</i>
<i>- You're welcome.</i>

01:57.450 --> 01:59.018
<i>Hey, this is beautiful.</i>
<i>I'm like --</i>

01:59.119 --> 02:00.487
<i>I'm sorry.</i>
<i>I'm like, wow.</i>

02:00.587 --> 02:01.855
<i>I'm totally wow,</i>

02:01.955 --> 02:03.656
and you're the biggest wow
of the whole thing.

02:03.756 --> 02:05.158
<i>I couldn't believe you walked</i>
<i>through that door.</i>

02:05.258 --> 02:06.960
<i>- Wow.</i>
<i>- How is your night?</i>

02:07.026 --> 02:08.695
<i>I don't want to be mean,</i>

02:08.795 --> 02:11.030
<i>but I think this is better</i>
<i>than the pool table date.</i>

02:11.131 --> 02:12.699
<i>Really?</i>
<i>I'll take that.</i>

02:12.799 --> 02:15.335
<i>- Okay.</i>
<i>- My dad -- he'll be fine.</i>

02:15.435 --> 02:17.704
<i>He's great. He's confident.</i>

02:17.804 --> 02:20.306
<i>He's himself.</i>
<i>I -- He's fine.</i>

02:20.373 --> 02:22.342
<i>Oh, my God.</i>
<i>Is this how Troy feels?</i>

02:22.442 --> 02:24.511
<i>I'm all alone.</i>

02:25.712 --> 02:28.615
<i>Yeah, we are here.</i>

02:28.681 --> 02:30.550
<i>Yeah.</i>

02:30.650 --> 02:31.985
<i>You're so quiet now.</i>

02:32.051 --> 02:33.653
Yeah, I kind of ran out of
stuff to talk about.

02:33.720 --> 02:35.121
<i>Why are you --</i>

02:35.188 --> 02:36.890
<i>My dad's choking, man,</i>
<i>now, kinda. He's not --</i>

02:36.990 --> 02:38.725
<i>Bro, it's good</i>
<i>to be nervous.</i>

02:38.825 --> 02:41.961
<i>My palms are fucking sweaty</i>
<i>right now.</i>

02:42.028 --> 02:43.496
<i>- All right.</i>

02:43.563 --> 02:45.698
<i>Do you guys literally think</i>
<i>this is going well?</i>

02:45.798 --> 02:47.500
<i>I don't think</i>
<i>it's going very good.</i>

02:47.567 --> 02:49.002
<i>I think</i>
<i>it's going horrible.</i>

02:49.068 --> 02:50.570
Oh, I think this is going
really good right now.

02:50.670 --> 02:52.305
<i>They're older,</i>
<i>and you still get nervous.</i>

02:52.372 --> 02:53.540
<i>That's when you know</i>
<i>it's something.</i>

02:53.640 --> 02:54.874
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>
<i>- Mmm.</i>

02:54.974 --> 02:56.409
- <i>This is moist.</i>
<i>- Yes,</i>

02:56.509 --> 02:59.078
<i>It's so delicious</i>
<i>and chocolaty.</i>

02:59.179 --> 03:00.880
<i>It looks delicious.</i>
<i>I'm not gonna lie.</i>

03:00.980 --> 03:03.016
<i>It's very smooth</i>
<i>on my tongue.</i>

03:03.082 --> 03:05.251
<i>Do you want to taste?</i>

03:05.351 --> 03:06.719
<i>May I?</i>

03:06.819 --> 03:08.555
<i>Absolutely.</i>

03:10.356 --> 03:11.424
<i>Mmm.</i>

03:11.524 --> 03:12.592
<i>that's very good.</i>

03:12.692 --> 03:14.227
<i>I'm so uncomfortable</i>
<i>right now.</i>

03:14.327 --> 03:16.429
<i>- Oh!</i>
<i>- Yeah, I hate this.</i>

03:16.529 --> 03:17.597
<i>Mmm.</i>

03:17.697 --> 03:18.831
<i>This is the whole point,</i>

03:18.898 --> 03:21.868
<i>is to find genuine connections</i>
<i>for them.</i>

03:21.935 --> 03:24.070
<i>- Ah.</i>
<i>- Kiss, kiss, kiss.</i>

03:24.170 --> 03:26.272
Damn, dude, I also don't want
to see my dad get rejected.

03:26.372 --> 03:27.440
<i>That would suck, man.</i>

03:27.540 --> 03:30.076
<i>It's kind of</i>
<i>a romantic moment.</i>

03:30.176 --> 03:31.411
<i>Absolutely is.</i>

03:31.511 --> 03:32.779
<i>MJ:</i>
<i>Yeah, I'm feeling a kiss.</i>

03:32.879 --> 03:34.881
<i>Like, they're totally</i>
<i>kissing tonight.</i>

03:34.948 --> 03:37.250
<i>I would be shocked if she kisses</i>
<i>on the first date...</i>

03:37.350 --> 03:39.085
<i>...'cause she never kisses</i>
<i>on the first date.</i>

03:39.185 --> 03:40.720
<i>- Ooh.</i>
<i>- Really?</i>

03:44.023 --> 03:48.061
<i>So would it be too clich√©</i>
<i>and too quick</i>

03:48.127 --> 03:49.629
<i>if I tried to</i>
<i>give you a kiss?</i>

03:49.729 --> 03:51.898
<i>- Aah!</i>
<i>- Oh, my God!</i>

03:51.965 --> 03:53.566
<i>I'm stressed.</i>

03:55.268 --> 03:57.570
<i>A little. </i>

03:57.637 --> 03:58.738
<i>- Too soon.</i>
<i>- I told you.</i>

03:58.805 --> 04:00.406
<i>- Oh!</i>
<i>- Told you.</i>

04:00.473 --> 04:03.309
<i>Got ya.</i>

04:03.409 --> 04:04.711
<i>A swing and a miss.</i>

04:04.777 --> 04:06.779
<i>- I mean, he looks sad.</i>
<i>- He looks a little sad.</i>

04:06.879 --> 04:09.749
<i>I'm sure his face</i>
<i>is gonna be so red, dude.</i>

04:09.816 --> 04:11.985
<i>So red.</i>

04:12.085 --> 04:14.654
<i>Troy: I feel like sometimes</i>
<i>I steamroll people,</i>

04:14.754 --> 04:18.992
<i>and I'm learning how to</i>
<i>take it down a notch or two.</i>

04:19.092 --> 04:20.827
<i>It doesn't mean</i>
<i>that you're not my number one.</i>

04:20.927 --> 04:22.295
<i>- Oh!</i>
<i>- I like that, actually.</i>

04:22.395 --> 04:24.264
- <i>I'm gonna think about that.</i>
<i>- You are?</i>

04:24.330 --> 04:25.798
<i>Yeah, something</i>
<i>to look forward to.</i>

04:25.898 --> 04:27.267
Is that what you're gonna
go to sleep with on your mind?

04:27.333 --> 04:29.168
<i>Yeah, actually, it is,</i>
<i>if I'm honest.</i>

04:29.269 --> 04:31.304
<i>It is? Wow. Okay.</i>

04:31.404 --> 04:32.739
<i>That makes me --</i>

04:32.805 --> 04:34.474
<i>that makes me feel, like...</i>

04:34.574 --> 04:36.609
<i>...like, tingly...</i>

04:36.676 --> 04:39.012
<i>...all inside.</i>

04:39.112 --> 04:41.347
<i>- Okay, all right. Never mind.</i>
<i>- I know where that feeling is.</i>

04:41.447 --> 04:43.082
<i>- Oh, no.</i>

04:43.149 --> 04:44.684
<i>- I like this.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

04:44.784 --> 04:46.286
<i>- This has been a good day.</i>
<i>- Aw.</i>

04:46.352 --> 04:47.820
<i>I think this is a great day,</i>
<i>actually.</i>

04:47.920 --> 04:49.622
<i>Thank you for tonight.</i>
<i>It was beautiful.</i>

04:49.689 --> 04:50.957
<i>It was great.</i>

04:51.024 --> 04:52.525
<i>Thank you. Yeah.</i>

04:52.625 --> 04:54.761
<i>Yes, we shall.</i>

05:00.967 --> 05:02.368
<i>Noah: Good night.</i>

05:02.468 --> 05:04.971
<i>Oh, my gosh. How's everybody</i>
<i>liking the floor?</i>

05:05.038 --> 05:07.607
<i>I have to sacrifice</i>
<i>my sleeping conditions,</i>

05:07.674 --> 05:09.208
<i>just to meddle with my parents.</i>

05:09.309 --> 05:11.978
<i>I mean, I guess it's worth it</i>
<i>for the dads and moms,</i>

05:12.045 --> 05:15.648
<i>but, you know,</i>
<i>my bed wasn't too comfy anyways.</i>

05:15.715 --> 05:17.617
We're some good-ass
kids, that's for sure.

05:17.684 --> 05:20.720
<i>Yeah, they should, like, buy me</i>
<i>a new car or something.</i>

05:20.820 --> 05:22.655
<i>- Yeah.</i>
<i>- Let's get this over with.</i>

05:22.722 --> 05:25.224
I'm gonna turn the lights out,
and we're going to bed.

05:25.325 --> 05:28.027
<i>Shut the door</i>
<i>so no monsters get in here.</i>

05:35.702 --> 05:37.570
<i>- Hey. Oh, that's four in a row.</i>
<i>- Oh!</i>

05:37.670 --> 05:39.405
<i>- On a roll.</i>
<i>- Come on, man.</i>

05:39.505 --> 05:40.740
<i>- I'm on a roll.</i>
<i>- Come on, man.</i>

05:40.840 --> 05:43.509
<i>- Kind of coming back here.</i>

05:46.412 --> 05:48.915
<i>- How you doing?</i>
<i>- Taking it all in.</i>

05:49.015 --> 05:52.352
I'm actually doing --
doing very well, thank you.

05:52.418 --> 05:55.088
Well, that's good that
they're getting to talk alone.

05:55.188 --> 05:57.857
<i>How did you get into this,</i>
<i>network marketing?</i>

05:57.924 --> 05:59.592
<i>I've never been</i>
<i>a 9-to-5er.</i>

05:59.692 --> 06:01.594
Like, I don't like people
telling me what to do.

06:01.694 --> 06:03.096
You know what I mean?
Like, I want to be able to

06:03.196 --> 06:05.331
<i>go to the bathroom</i>
<i>when I want to go.</i>

06:06.766 --> 06:09.102
If all else fails, I want to
hang out with your mom.

06:09.202 --> 06:10.737
<i>Right? </i>

06:10.837 --> 06:13.606
I would consider myself,
like, naturally, a giver.

06:13.706 --> 06:15.441
That's why I always like
to help other people,

06:15.541 --> 06:18.778
because there's always somebody
who's going through worse.

06:18.878 --> 06:20.346
<i>That's what my dad</i>
<i>always tells me</i>

06:20.413 --> 06:22.782
<i>every time I complain</i>
<i>about something small.</i>

06:22.882 --> 06:24.283
<i>That's phenomenal.</i>

06:24.384 --> 06:26.619
I mean, you're already such a
beautiful woman on the outside.

06:26.719 --> 06:30.790
<i>Thank you.</i>

06:30.890 --> 06:33.960
<i>you know,</i>
<i>beauty sells you short.</i>

06:34.060 --> 06:35.428
<i>MJ: I definitely feel</i>
<i>like my mom,</i>

06:35.528 --> 06:37.630
<i>like, loves your dad's</i>
<i>personality.</i>

06:37.730 --> 06:41.401
<i>I just feel like PJ's dad,</i>
<i>future-wise,</i>

06:41.467 --> 06:42.969
<i>will be the best</i>
<i>for my mom.</i>

06:43.069 --> 06:45.138
I think they definitely
have a lot in common.

06:45.238 --> 06:47.907
Like, even if you don't
see that long-term...

06:47.974 --> 06:49.942
<i>...just so many of the things</i>
<i>your mom has said,</i>

06:50.042 --> 06:52.311
I'm like, whoa, my dad's said
the exact same thing.

06:52.412 --> 06:55.148
<i>At the same time.</i>
<i>I mean, that's also a way</i>

06:55.248 --> 06:57.650
<i>to just make good,</i>
<i>like, best friends.</i>

06:57.750 --> 07:00.887
<i>I know my dad.</i>
<i>I know my dad's a great man.</i>

07:00.953 --> 07:04.557
<i>And I feel like</i>
<i>MJ doesn't see that.</i>

07:04.624 --> 07:05.758
<i>Yeah.</i>

07:05.825 --> 07:07.660
<i>I'm not really enjoying</i>
<i>this situation</i>

07:07.760 --> 07:09.662
<i>between my mom and Scott</i>

07:09.762 --> 07:15.001
<i>because outside of the retreat,</i>
<i>it's not all fun.</i>

07:15.101 --> 07:19.138
<i>And right now, I'm just not</i>
<i>comfortable with it.</i>

07:22.909 --> 07:24.977
<i>Noah: It's Meddle time!</i>

07:32.318 --> 07:34.120
<i>- Oh!</i>
<i>- Oh, my gosh. That's fun.</i>

07:34.187 --> 07:36.255
<i>- That's kind of cute.</i>
<i>- I just -- I think it's --</i>

07:36.322 --> 07:37.490
<i>- But...</i>
<i>- Oh.</i>

07:37.590 --> 07:39.692
<i>Alex: "In order to use</i>
<i>this Meddle,</i>

07:39.792 --> 07:42.028
<i>you must sacrifice dinner</i>
<i>tonight</i>

07:42.128 --> 07:44.297
<i>and eat only a broccoli buffet</i>

07:44.363 --> 07:48.301
<i>and drink broccoli beverages</i>
<i>for the rest of the night."</i>

07:48.367 --> 07:51.771
Broccoli beverages sound like
they need to be, like, illegal.

07:52.672 --> 07:55.041
<i>Do you wish to proceed?</i>
<i>Yes or no?</i>

07:55.141 --> 07:57.176
<i>I'm gonna proceed with no.</i>

07:59.145 --> 08:02.515
<i>Sacrificing food for broccoli?</i>

08:02.615 --> 08:04.450
<i>I'm so hungry tonight.</i>

08:04.517 --> 08:05.785
<i>I'm not doing that.</i>

08:05.852 --> 08:07.053
<i>My mom -- she's doing awesome,</i>

08:07.153 --> 08:09.655
<i>so I'm gonna say no to that.</i>

08:10.223 --> 08:12.058
<i>Yes.</i>
<i>Absolutely yes.</i>

08:12.158 --> 08:13.893
<i>He needs help.</i>
<i>He needs to relax.</i>

08:13.993 --> 08:16.963
<i>He's nervous, talking too much</i>
<i>about stuff nobody cares about.</i>

08:17.029 --> 08:19.232
<i>I'll do it with you.</i>
<i>I'll do it with you.</i>

08:19.332 --> 08:22.635
<i>I think I'm gonna say yes,</i>
<i>I'll proceed with that.</i>

08:22.702 --> 08:24.070
<i>There you go.</i>

08:24.170 --> 08:25.738
<i>Noah: Karen and my dad --</i>
<i>they've been having chemistry</i>

08:25.838 --> 08:28.574
<i>since the start of this,</i>
<i>but I also can't deny the fact</i>

08:28.674 --> 08:30.576
<i>that they need to explore</i>
<i>all their options.</i>

08:30.676 --> 08:33.679
<i>All right, guys, let's...</i>
<i>not eat broccoli.</i>

08:33.746 --> 08:35.548
<i>You guys can have fun.</i>

08:45.191 --> 08:46.926
<i>- Oh.</i>
<i>- Oh.</i>

08:47.026 --> 08:48.528
<i>Oh, they're dancing.</i>

08:48.594 --> 08:51.430
<i>Hey. And bump.</i>
<i>Yay!</i>

08:51.531 --> 08:52.832
<i>- Oh.</i>
<i>- Ew.</i>

08:52.899 --> 08:54.267
<i>Tacos.</i>

08:54.367 --> 08:57.570
<i>- Looks delish.</i>
<i>- Ew!</i>

08:57.670 --> 08:59.005
<i>That shit was kind of nasty.</i>

08:59.071 --> 09:00.006
<i>Is that a pie, though?</i>

09:00.072 --> 09:02.341
<i>Broccoli pie, taco broccoli.</i>

09:02.408 --> 09:03.743
<i>What do you guys want to</i>
<i>try first? The hot do--</i>

09:03.843 --> 09:05.278
<i>I'm kind of looking at</i>
<i>these hot dogs.</i>

09:05.378 --> 09:06.412
<i>Broccoli hot dogs.</i>

09:06.512 --> 09:09.382
<i>- Word.</i>
<i>- Broccoli juice.</i>

09:09.448 --> 09:12.418
<i>- Ew!</i>
<i>- You're a good son.</i>

09:12.518 --> 09:14.754
<i>And that was my cue</i>
<i>to go make some ice cream.</i>

09:16.455 --> 09:17.790
<i>- Oh, my God!</i>
<i>- Oh, oh.</i>

09:17.890 --> 09:20.059
<i>- Oh!</i>
<i>- Oh, oh. Uh-oh!</i>

09:20.126 --> 09:22.295
<i>Okay, why did my mom</i>
<i>just do that?</i>

09:25.231 --> 09:27.533
<i>So cringey,</i>
<i>this little --</i>

09:27.600 --> 09:30.469
<i>Yeah, this circle stuff</i>
<i>is...</i>

09:30.570 --> 09:31.971
<i>Way to go, guy.</i>

09:32.071 --> 09:35.808
<i>- Oh, my.</i>
<i>- What is going on with Scott?</i>

09:35.908 --> 09:38.578
Break it down! Break it down,
though, break it down.

09:40.079 --> 09:43.716
<i>I mean, my dad has no shame</i>
<i>with the moves, clearly.</i>

09:43.783 --> 09:46.152
<i>He's so authentically him.</i>

09:46.252 --> 09:49.221
<i>My dad is super-adamant</i>
<i>about always being</i>

09:49.288 --> 09:52.091
<i>our true, authentic selves.</i>

09:53.826 --> 09:57.830
<i>And it's amazing to see that my</i>
<i>dad practices what he preaches,</i>

09:57.930 --> 10:00.733
<i>always walking around,</i>
<i>being his goofy self, being him.</i>

10:00.800 --> 10:02.468
<i>He doesn't care</i>
<i>what people think.</i>

10:02.568 --> 10:03.836
<i>And I think it's amazing.</i>

10:03.936 --> 10:05.838
<i>I hope that I can</i>
<i>get to that point one day.</i>

10:05.938 --> 10:08.274
<i>I hope everyone can</i>
<i>get to that point one day.</i>

10:08.341 --> 10:10.076
<i>I'm gonna go stick my foot</i>
<i>in the hot tub.</i>

10:10.142 --> 10:11.844
<i>Yes, I was thinking</i>
<i>the same thing.</i>

10:11.944 --> 10:14.347
Maybe we should go over here,
girls, and give the men a break.

10:14.447 --> 10:16.182
<i>Oh, should we?</i>
<i>'Cause I was...</i>

10:16.282 --> 10:18.017
<i>No, you should definitely</i>
<i>not do that.</i>

10:18.117 --> 10:19.118
<i>Yeah, I'm like, what?</i>

10:19.185 --> 10:22.088
<i>That's cute.</i>

10:23.089 --> 10:25.958
<i>- Our parents are kind of close.</i>
<i>- Oh, a little bit.</i>

10:26.025 --> 10:27.493
<i>A little bit close.</i>
<i>They're cozy.</i>

10:27.593 --> 10:29.195
<i>- A little bit.</i>
<i>- Oh, they are.</i>

10:29.295 --> 10:32.498
<i>When we find love,</i>
<i>where would you want to go?</i>

10:32.598 --> 10:34.533
You know, I can't remember
exactly where it is,

10:34.634 --> 10:36.969
and I want to say it's
either Bali or the Maldives.

10:37.036 --> 10:40.339
They have these, like,
hut things out in the water,

10:40.439 --> 10:42.108
<i>and it seems like</i>
<i>one of the most beautiful,</i>

10:42.174 --> 10:43.609
<i>romantic places, you know?</i>

10:43.676 --> 10:45.645
<i>- I'm just gonna go there.</i>
<i>- You're just gonna go there?</i>

10:45.711 --> 10:48.547
And I'm just gonna move
a little bit closer.

10:48.648 --> 10:49.882
<i>Oh, LOL.</i>

10:49.982 --> 10:51.851
<i>MJ: I just feel like Scott</i>
<i>is kind of rushing</i>

10:51.951 --> 10:53.219
<i>a little bit too much,</i>

10:53.319 --> 10:55.655
<i>and I feel like</i>
<i>that's been my mom's problem</i>

10:55.721 --> 10:57.823
<i>in a lot of her recent</i>
<i>relationships,</i>

10:57.890 --> 11:00.226
<i>just going into it too quick.</i>

11:00.326 --> 11:01.994
<i>Troy: Karen,</i>
<i>what are you thinking?</i>

11:02.061 --> 11:03.996
<i>I want to go</i>
<i>to the Maldives island.</i>

11:04.063 --> 11:05.231
<i>Okay.</i>

11:05.331 --> 11:07.166
<i>And just have</i>
<i>a beautiful, romantic time,</i>

11:07.233 --> 11:08.834
<i>and I'm looking at you.</i>

11:08.901 --> 11:11.070
<i>- Oh!</i>
<i>- Oh!</i>

11:11.170 --> 11:12.405
<i>- Oh!</i>
<i>- Oh.</i>

11:12.505 --> 11:15.074
<i>- Oh, I see the sparks.</i>
<i>- I love that.</i>

11:15.174 --> 11:16.409
<i>I love the Maldives.</i>

11:16.509 --> 11:17.877
<i>- That sounds like a great idea.</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

11:17.977 --> 11:19.378
<i>- Good for you.</i>
<i>- Do you agree?</i>

11:19.478 --> 11:21.247
<i>I agree.</i>

11:21.347 --> 11:22.682
<i>I'm not liking that.</i>

11:22.748 --> 11:24.917
What, by just being
so confident, like...

11:25.017 --> 11:27.687
<i>Already like, yeah, like,</i>
<i>this was happening.</i>

11:27.753 --> 11:29.922
<i>And that never works out.</i>

11:30.022 --> 11:31.424
<i>Oh.</i>

11:32.892 --> 11:34.593
<i>- Wearing the same stuff.</i>
<i>- Look who's here.</i>

11:34.694 --> 11:36.429
<i>- Hi, guys.</i>
<i>- Jimmy!</i>

11:36.529 --> 11:38.831
<i>- I brought you a little treat.</i>
<i>- Should we be scared?</i>

11:38.898 --> 11:40.566
<i>Could you pass this down</i>
<i>to Phill?</i>

11:40.666 --> 11:43.235
<i>- Oh, Jimmy!</i>
<i>- Oh, Jimmy!</i>

11:43.335 --> 11:44.737
<i>What's the surprise,</i>
<i>Jimmy?</i>

11:44.837 --> 11:45.938
<i>Pass that to Karen.</i>

11:46.038 --> 11:48.207
<i>You may have to</i>
<i>read a fortune.</i>

11:48.274 --> 11:49.709
<i>Alex: Oh, they all</i>
<i>have cookies.</i>

11:49.775 --> 11:52.011
<i>They just don't</i>
<i>all have fortunes.</i>

11:52.078 --> 11:54.113
<i>Guys, if you do receive</i>
<i>a fortune,</i>

11:54.213 --> 11:55.614
<i>read to each other aloud,</i>

11:55.715 --> 11:58.784
<i>and good fortune</i>
<i>to you all.</i>

11:58.884 --> 12:00.419
<i>- Thank you.</i>
<i>- Thank you.</i>

12:00.519 --> 12:03.122
<i>- Thank you.</i>
<i>- Ah! No!</i>

12:03.222 --> 12:06.125
<i>Jimmy, Phill has no fortune.</i>

12:06.225 --> 12:08.127
<i>- Oh, my God! No!</i>
<i>- Oh!</i>

12:08.227 --> 12:09.929
<i>- I feel so bad!</i>

12:10.029 --> 12:11.230
<i>Yeah. I'm sorry, Dad.</i>

12:11.297 --> 12:12.798
<i>- Fortune.</i>
<i>- No, I don't have one.</i>

12:12.898 --> 12:14.300
<i>- Philip does.</i>
<i>- See, look.</i>

12:14.400 --> 12:16.435
<i>He has to hold it out here.</i>

12:16.535 --> 12:18.137
<i>Philip:</i>
<i>Well, my fortune says,</i>

12:18.237 --> 12:22.875
<i>"Listening is always better</i>
<i>than speaking."</i>

12:22.942 --> 12:24.376
<i>- Wow. That's deep.</i>
<i>- So true.</i>

12:24.443 --> 12:25.611
<i>That's deep.</i>
<i>I love that.</i>

12:25.711 --> 12:27.980
<i>- Yes.</i>
<i>- That's deep, bro.</i>

12:28.080 --> 12:30.149
<i>Yes, Trish. She knows.</i>
<i>She gets it.</i>

12:30.249 --> 12:33.886
<i>Okay, so let's see</i>
<i>what my fortune says.</i>

12:33.953 --> 12:37.490
<i>"Be a confident person.</i>
<i>Be strong.</i>

12:37.590 --> 12:40.960
<i>Make sure you view your options</i>

12:41.060 --> 12:43.929
<i>and use your time wisely."</i>

12:43.996 --> 12:46.732
<i>- Wow!</i>
<i>- Oh!</i>

12:46.799 --> 12:48.634
<i>Trish: I love that.</i>

12:48.734 --> 12:53.572
<i>"A wise man never puts</i>
<i>all his eggs in one basket."</i>

12:53.639 --> 12:54.673
<i>- Oh, okay.</i>
<i>- Mm.</i>

12:54.774 --> 12:56.342
<i>"Be wise."</i>

13:01.580 --> 13:03.015
<i>Awkward!</i>

13:03.115 --> 13:05.084
<i>It's good seeing my dad</i>
<i>enjoy himself like this,</i>

13:05.151 --> 13:06.852
<i>and he seems like</i>
<i>he met someone he likes,</i>

13:06.952 --> 13:08.921
<i>but I want him to take it slow.</i>

13:08.988 --> 13:10.589
<i>I don't want him</i>
<i>rushing in anything.</i>

13:10.656 --> 13:12.758
<i>It's a hard pill to swallow,</i>
<i>but you need to swallow it.</i>

13:12.825 --> 13:14.193
<i>- Cheers to good fortune.</i>
<i>- Cheers.</i>

13:14.293 --> 13:16.128
<i>- To good fortune.</i>
<i>- Cheers.</i>

13:24.370 --> 13:26.939
Why are my shoes making
this noise? It's so annoying.

13:27.006 --> 13:29.141
They probably got wet
or sticky or something.

13:29.208 --> 13:30.676
<i>Yeah, ew.</i>

13:30.776 --> 13:32.945
<i>You got to be able to, like,</i>
<i>talk with your parents</i>

13:33.012 --> 13:34.547
<i>like, about anything.</i>

13:34.647 --> 13:36.215
When I was 19, I never
talked to my dad, 'cause, like,

13:36.315 --> 13:38.117
he never really gave me
any advice on dating at all.

13:38.184 --> 13:39.485
<i>Right.</i>
<i>For relationships and stuff,</i>

13:39.552 --> 13:40.986
<i>I always keep that away</i>
<i>from my father.</i>

13:41.053 --> 13:42.521
<i>Going through the divorce</i>
<i>was definitely</i>

13:42.621 --> 13:43.722
<i>a hard time for my dad.</i>

13:43.823 --> 13:45.357
<i>I feel like that</i>
<i>could have had an effect</i>

13:45.457 --> 13:47.059
<i>on why he doesn't like</i>
<i>relationships, too, with me,</i>

13:47.159 --> 13:48.527
<i>and he wants me</i>
<i>to focus on myself.</i>

13:48.627 --> 13:50.462
<i>With my mom, I, like,</i>
<i>express with her.</i>

13:50.529 --> 13:53.199
<i>But I've currently been</i>
<i>in a relationship</i>

13:53.299 --> 13:54.300
<i>for almost two years.</i>

13:54.366 --> 13:55.501
<i>And I haven't</i>
<i>opened up to him</i>

13:55.568 --> 13:57.036
<i>about it yet,</i>
<i>but, I mean, like,</i>

13:57.136 --> 13:59.038
there's eventually a time
when my dad's gonna be like,

13:59.138 --> 14:00.206
<i>"What's this?"</i>
<i>You know what I mean?</i>

14:00.306 --> 14:01.574
<i>And I have to</i>
<i>come clean to him.</i>

14:01.674 --> 14:02.908
<i>You know what I mean?</i>

14:03.008 --> 14:05.344
<i>I feel like</i>
<i>throughout this experience,</i>

14:05.411 --> 14:06.745
<i>it could definitely</i>
<i>change his view,</i>

14:06.846 --> 14:10.015
<i>and maybe he'll be</i>
<i>a little more optimistic</i>

14:10.082 --> 14:12.484
<i>about relationships in general.</i>

14:12.551 --> 14:14.253
<i>Dude that's actually</i>
<i>super interesting,</i>

14:14.353 --> 14:16.088
the fact that you guys
went ahead and did this.

14:18.390 --> 14:21.193
<i>- Hi.</i>
<i>- How you guys doing?</i>

14:21.260 --> 14:22.428
<i>- Good.</i>
<i>- Good.</i>

14:22.528 --> 14:23.762
<i>All right, guys,</i>
<i>I'm about to give you</i>

14:23.863 --> 14:26.265
<i>an</i> <i> incredible</i>
<i>meddling opportunity.</i>

14:26.365 --> 14:30.002
Not only will you get to pick
a date for your mom or your dad

14:30.069 --> 14:32.104
<i>with whichever parents</i>
<i>you choose,</i>

14:32.204 --> 14:36.275
<i>but you'll also be able</i>
<i>to go undercover</i>

14:36.375 --> 14:37.443
<i>during the date.</i>

14:37.543 --> 14:39.178
<i>- I like that.</i>
<i>- Yeah!</i>

14:39.245 --> 14:40.779
<i>And while you're undercover,</i>
<i>you will help</i>

14:40.880 --> 14:42.448
<i>to steer</i>
<i>their romantic journey</i>

14:42.548 --> 14:44.116
<i>in the direction</i>
<i>of your choosing.</i>

14:44.216 --> 14:45.751
<i>- Oh, wow.</i>
<i>- Oh.</i>

14:45.851 --> 14:48.120
<i>Miles:</i>
<i>We get to go spy on a date,</i>

14:48.220 --> 14:52.558
<i>but not just a regular date --</i>
<i>a date off-site.</i>

14:52.625 --> 14:54.260
<i>Now that makes me want to win.</i>

14:54.360 --> 14:57.363
<i>So in order to win, we are gonna</i>
<i>play a little game</i>

14:57.429 --> 15:02.468
<i>to test your knowledge of your</i>
<i>parents' more flirtatious side.</i>

15:02.568 --> 15:04.236
<i>It's called...</i>

15:06.238 --> 15:09.308
Each of you are gonna take turns
sliding into the pool.

15:09.408 --> 15:10.643
<i>You're gonna grab a floaty,</i>

15:10.743 --> 15:14.246
<i>and underneath each floaty</i>
<i>is a quote,</i>

15:14.313 --> 15:18.117
pick-up lines that your parents
have actually written or said

15:18.217 --> 15:21.320
<i>to some unsuspecting</i>
<i>human being.</i>

15:21.420 --> 15:24.657
<i>You have to decide</i>
<i>if your parents said it or not,</i>

15:24.757 --> 15:26.225
<i>and if not,</i>

15:26.292 --> 15:29.595
<i>which mom or dad you think</i>
<i>actually said those words.</i>

15:29.662 --> 15:33.098
<i>I don't know if my mom's smooth</i>
<i>enough to slide into some DMs,</i>

15:33.165 --> 15:36.001
<i>but I guess we gonna</i>
<i>see what happens.</i>

15:36.101 --> 15:39.672
<i>The first one to slide in --</i>
<i>Breana.</i>

15:39.772 --> 15:41.473
<i>- Uh-oh.</i>
<i>- You're up.</i>

15:41.573 --> 15:43.142
<i>- Good luck.</i>

15:43.242 --> 15:46.312
<i>Breana: I want this because</i>
<i>the best thing for my mom</i>

15:46.412 --> 15:49.348
<i>would be go on dates with</i>
<i>every single one of the dads,</i>

15:49.448 --> 15:51.583
<i>just to test the waters</i>
<i>with each one.</i>

15:51.650 --> 15:54.520
<i>- Let's go!</i>
<i>- Breana! Breana!</i>

15:54.620 --> 15:55.688
<i>- Whoo!</i>

15:55.788 --> 15:57.990
<i>Yay! All right.</i>

15:58.090 --> 15:59.992
<i>Grab one. Boom.</i>

16:07.433 --> 16:08.701
<i>Who do you think it is?</i>

16:08.801 --> 16:10.669
<i>- It's obviously a dad.</i>
<i>- It's obviously a dad.</i>

16:10.769 --> 16:13.806
<i>I might say Troy,</i>
<i>possibly?</i>

16:13.872 --> 16:14.974
<i>Okay.</i>

16:15.040 --> 16:17.376
<i>- You are incorrect.</i>
<i>- Oh.</i>

16:17.476 --> 16:20.846
<i>The correct answer</i>
<i>is actually Philip Sr.</i>

16:20.946 --> 16:22.715
<i>- Oh! I was thinking...</i>
<i>- Philip!</i>

16:22.815 --> 16:26.051
<i>Very, like,</i>
<i>just vanilla, generic.</i>

16:26.151 --> 16:28.520
<i>That's him. Yeah.</i>

16:30.522 --> 16:35.327
"Aside from being sexy,
what else do you like doing?"

16:35.394 --> 16:37.796
<i>I'm just gonna say Troy.</i>

16:37.863 --> 16:39.398
<i>- Karen!</i>
<i>- Oh!</i>

16:39.498 --> 16:40.699
<i>- Oh!</i>
<i>- Karen!</i>

16:43.335 --> 16:46.572
<i>"I knew I loved you</i>
<i>before I met you."</i>

16:46.672 --> 16:48.574
<i>Got it!</i>

16:48.674 --> 16:49.675
<i>Troy.</i>

16:49.742 --> 16:50.743
<i>- Troy?</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

16:50.843 --> 16:52.811
<i>You are incorrect.</i>

16:52.878 --> 16:54.713
<i>- Oh.</i>
<i>- Oh, wow.</i>

16:54.813 --> 16:57.883
<i>- That was actually Philip!</i>
<i>- Philip Sr.?</i>

16:57.983 --> 16:59.485
<i>He got better game</i>
<i>than you thought.</i>

16:59.551 --> 17:01.387
<i>Yeah, that was a lot better</i>
<i>than the first one.</i>

17:01.487 --> 17:02.755
<i>Whoo!</i>

17:05.190 --> 17:07.493
<i>"You look amazing</i>
<i>in your pictures!</i>

17:07.559 --> 17:08.994
<i>How soon can we talk?"</i>

17:09.061 --> 17:11.397
<i>- Patricia. Patricia.</i>
<i>- You think it's your mom?</i>

17:11.497 --> 17:14.433
<i>- Yeah.</i>
<i>- That was said by...</i>

17:14.533 --> 17:15.734
- <i>...Troy!</i>
<i>- Oh!</i>

17:15.834 --> 17:17.002
<i>- Oh!</i>
<i>- Seriously?</i>

17:17.069 --> 17:19.271
<i>"You look amazing</i>
<i>in your pictures."</i>

17:19.371 --> 17:22.775
<i>So I'm saying, shawty,</i>
<i>how soon can we talk?</i>

17:22.875 --> 17:24.443
I mean, I don't think he said it
with the shoulders,

17:24.543 --> 17:26.412
<i>but that's how</i>
<i>I interpret it.</i>

17:26.512 --> 17:27.946
<i>- Oh, yeah.</i>
<i>- Wow.</i>

17:28.047 --> 17:29.848
<i>Side.</i>
<i>Oh, to the side.</i>

17:29.915 --> 17:33.052
<i>We getting real cocky out here.</i>
<i>Okay.</i>

17:33.118 --> 17:35.954
All right, this one says,
"Can I tie your shoes?

17:36.055 --> 17:38.724
'Cause I don't want you
falling for anyone else."

17:38.791 --> 17:41.226
<i>Wow!</i>

17:41.293 --> 17:43.362
<i>That is a Trish line.</i>

17:43.429 --> 17:44.730
<i>- Ah!</i>

17:44.797 --> 17:47.099
<i>Trish is cool</i>
<i>with the pick-up lines.</i>

17:47.199 --> 17:48.801
<i>I like that.</i>

17:48.901 --> 17:50.402
<i>All right, what do you got?</i>
<i>Let me see.</i>

17:50.469 --> 17:55.140
<i>"I know of an opening</i>
<i>for a third ex-wife.</i>

17:55.240 --> 17:56.708
<i>Interested?"</i>

17:56.775 --> 18:00.612
<i>I know Scott has two ex-wives,</i>
<i>Alex's dad.</i>

18:00.712 --> 18:03.482
<i>That's right.</i>

18:03.582 --> 18:04.950
<i>So I'm gonna go with Scott.</i>

18:05.050 --> 18:07.086
<i>- You gonna go with Scott?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

18:07.152 --> 18:08.821
<i>He's never said that.</i>
<i>There's no way.</i>

18:08.921 --> 18:10.756
<i>- That's your final answer?</i>
<i>- Final answer.</i>

18:10.823 --> 18:12.925
<i>Final answer.</i>

18:12.991 --> 18:14.660
<i>That is correct!</i>

18:14.760 --> 18:17.629
<i>- Your dad's been married twice?</i>
<i>- PJ's in the lead.</i>

18:17.729 --> 18:20.232
<i>Alex, you need this</i>
<i>to stay in the game.</i>

18:20.299 --> 18:22.000
<i>Let's go!</i>

18:22.101 --> 18:24.503
<i>Whoo!</i>
<i>Here she goes.</i>

18:24.603 --> 18:26.805
<i>All right, Alex.</i>

18:26.905 --> 18:28.173
<i>"Are you hoping to hook up</i>

18:28.273 --> 18:31.076
<i>and have really</i>
<i>disappointing sex tonight?</i>

18:31.143 --> 18:33.779
<i>If so, I'm your guy."</i>

18:33.846 --> 18:37.082
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

18:37.149 --> 18:39.618
<i>- Who said this?</i>
<i>- I'm gonna say it's Phill.</i>

18:39.685 --> 18:42.154
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>I can't see him saying that.</i>

18:42.254 --> 18:44.289
<i>Well, what's really</i>
<i>disappointing</i>

18:44.356 --> 18:46.191
<i>is that the person</i>
<i>who actually said this...</i>

18:46.291 --> 18:47.860
<i>- Is my dad?</i>
<i>- ...is your dad.</i>

18:47.960 --> 18:49.995
- <i>Dad!</i>
<i>- Wow.</i>

18:50.095 --> 18:52.965
<i>I've learned so much</i>
<i>about my dad,</i>

18:53.031 --> 18:56.368
<i>a lot of things that I probably</i>
<i>could have gone without knowing,</i>

18:56.468 --> 18:58.036
<i>but, you know what that's okay.</i>

18:58.137 --> 19:01.507
<i>All right, so PJ, you are</i>
<i>the winner of this meddle.</i>

19:01.607 --> 19:04.476
<i>That means your dad,</i>
<i>Philip Sr.,</i>

19:04.543 --> 19:08.213
gets to go on a date
with the mother of your choice.

19:08.313 --> 19:09.448
<i>Who will it be?</i>

19:09.515 --> 19:13.719
<i>Karen, Deneia,</i>
<i>or Patricia?</i>

19:13.819 --> 19:17.456
<i>I feel like Philip Sr.'s</i>
<i>a good choice for my mom.</i>

19:17.523 --> 19:20.893
<i>So I hope PJ</i>
<i>says my mom for the date.</i>

19:20.993 --> 19:22.694
I think it's good for him
to switch it around

19:22.794 --> 19:23.962
<i>in the first couple days,</i>
<i>so...</i>

19:24.029 --> 19:25.797
<i>- Okay.</i>
<i>- ...I'm gonna go with Karen.</i>

19:25.864 --> 19:28.367
<i>Yvonne: All right.</i>

19:28.467 --> 19:29.735
<i>Dang.</i>

19:29.835 --> 19:32.037
<i>- So you're gonna go undercover.</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

19:32.137 --> 19:34.072
<i>But Breana, I got a little</i>
<i>surprise for you.</i>

19:34.173 --> 19:37.409
<i>You</i> are also going
undercover with PJ...

19:37.509 --> 19:39.244
<i>...to help your mom out,</i>
<i>too.</i>

19:39.344 --> 19:40.546
<i>All right?</i>

19:40.646 --> 19:42.047
<i>We need all the help</i>
<i>we can get, so...</i>

19:42.147 --> 19:43.849
<i>- Yeah, they definitely do.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

19:43.916 --> 19:45.350
All right, I'll check in
on you guys tomorrow

19:45.417 --> 19:46.418
<i>and see how things went.</i>

19:46.518 --> 19:47.686
<i>- Sounds good.</i>
<i>- Thank you.</i>

19:47.753 --> 19:49.655
<i>- Have fun.</i>
<i>- Bye.</i>

19:49.721 --> 19:51.523
<i>- Bye!</i>
<i>- See you later.</i>

19:51.590 --> 19:52.925
<i>I'm really excited.</i>

19:53.025 --> 19:54.526
<i>I think that this is my chance</i>
<i>to get my mom</i>

19:54.593 --> 19:57.429
<i>to really pay attention</i>
<i>to what I have to say</i>

19:57.529 --> 20:00.232
<i>and take my advice</i>
<i>without actually knowing</i>

20:00.332 --> 20:01.833
<i>she's taking my advice.</i>

20:08.173 --> 20:09.775
<i>You brought a lot of shoes.</i>

20:09.875 --> 20:10.876
<i>Yeah, bro.</i>

20:10.943 --> 20:13.245
<i>Why all the shoes?</i>

20:13.345 --> 20:15.113
<i>I like how they look.</i>

20:24.389 --> 20:26.725
Our house was a mess,
and my mother's wondering...

20:26.792 --> 20:29.261
<i>Look how nice and clean</i>
<i>their kitchen is.</i>

20:30.562 --> 20:33.465
<i>Everything's clean.</i>

20:33.565 --> 20:35.300
<i>Hello, hello.</i>

20:35.400 --> 20:37.102
<i>- It's Yvonne.</i>
<i>- Hello!</i>

20:37.202 --> 20:40.639
<i>- Hello, hello, hello.</i>
<i>- Ah, look who's here.</i>

20:40.739 --> 20:43.575
<i>- Hey!</i>
<i>- Join me, join me.</i>

20:43.642 --> 20:45.577
Oh, they don't know
they're gonna go on a date yet,

20:45.644 --> 20:47.546
- <i>Karen and Phill.</i>
<i>- Oh, they don't know yet.</i>

20:47.613 --> 20:48.814
<i>They're about to</i>
<i>find out right now.</i>

20:48.914 --> 20:50.215
<i>- After you, ladies.</i>
<i>- Thank you.</i>

20:50.282 --> 20:51.750
<i>- Oh, what a gentleman.</i>
<i>- Thank you.</i>

20:51.817 --> 20:53.151
<i>No, I just like to see</i>
<i>where you're sitting</i>

20:53.252 --> 20:55.554
<i>so I can make my move in there,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

20:55.621 --> 20:57.389
<i>Don't give them a chance</i>
<i>to get away.</i>

20:57.456 --> 21:00.459
<i>All right, well,</i>
<i>as you know,</i>

21:00.559 --> 21:01.727
<i>we have</i>
<i>the dating consultants</i>

21:01.793 --> 21:03.729
<i>kind of checking out the vibe</i>

21:03.795 --> 21:06.098
<i>and seeing, like, you know,</i>
<i>what's going on.</i>

21:06.164 --> 21:07.833
<i>- Oh, that's us.</i>
<i>- Right.</i>

21:09.434 --> 21:15.007
So, two of you will be
going on a very romantic date

21:15.107 --> 21:16.942
<i>outside of the retreat</i>
<i>tonight.</i>

21:17.009 --> 21:18.910
<i>- Ooh.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

21:18.977 --> 21:20.312
<i>They've been</i>
<i>picking up the vibes</i>

21:20.412 --> 21:21.580
<i>that you guys</i>
<i>have been putting down,</i>

21:21.647 --> 21:23.148
<i>so they paired</i>
<i>you guys off.</i>

21:23.248 --> 21:25.684
<i>Oh, my dad probably thinks</i>
<i>it's gonna be him, too,</i>

21:25.784 --> 21:27.519
<i>'cause he last one</i>
<i>he got left out.</i>

21:27.619 --> 21:30.522
<i>- Oh!</i>
<i>- Aw!</i>

21:30.622 --> 21:35.627
<i>All right, the two of you</i>
<i>who will be going outside</i>

21:35.694 --> 21:38.864
<i>on the first</i>
<i>off-site date is...</i>

21:41.133 --> 21:44.136
<i>...Karen...</i>

21:44.202 --> 21:45.537
<i>and Philip.</i>

21:45.637 --> 21:47.873
<i>- Oh!</i>
<i>- Whoa!</i>

21:47.973 --> 21:50.442
<i>Oh, I feel so bad!</i>

21:50.509 --> 21:52.377
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

21:52.477 --> 21:53.478
<i>Philip!</i>

21:53.545 --> 21:54.813
<i>- That works.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

21:54.880 --> 21:56.214
<i>That's actually</i>
<i>really</i> <i> nice.</i>

21:56.315 --> 21:59.117
<i>- Little one-on-one action.</i>
<i>- His smile!</i>

21:59.184 --> 22:00.886
- <i>He's -- oh.</i>
<i>- Oh.</i>

22:00.986 --> 22:03.055
<i>So I hope you guys</i>
<i>are a little flexible,</i>

22:03.155 --> 22:05.724
'cause you're gonna be doing
some paddleboard yoga.

22:05.824 --> 22:07.225
<i>- On the water?</i>
<i>- Yeah!</i>

22:07.326 --> 22:09.628
<i>- Paddleboard yoga?</i>
<i>- Now I'm really jealous.</i>

22:09.695 --> 22:11.229
<i>You don't know how to</i>
<i>stand-up paddleboard?</i>

22:11.330 --> 22:12.531
<i>But -- but yoga?</i>

22:14.166 --> 22:17.002
<i>What? I'm gonna get educated,</i>
<i>I can see.</i>

22:17.069 --> 22:18.737
<i>Have you done</i>
<i>paddleboard yoga?</i>

22:18.837 --> 22:20.872
<i>No, but I paddleboard.</i>

22:20.972 --> 22:22.407
<i>- Yes.</i>
<i>- So now you're gonna combine.</i>

22:22.507 --> 22:25.210
<i>I know. I might fall,</i>
<i>but that's okay.</i>

22:25.310 --> 22:27.746
<i>Will you fall in love?</i>

22:30.515 --> 22:32.918
<i>Is Phill the unexpected player</i>
<i>of the house?</i>

22:33.018 --> 22:34.186
<i>No, no.</i>

22:34.252 --> 22:35.587
<i>Phill's holy water</i>
<i>of the house.</i>

22:35.687 --> 22:37.089
Okay, you got some more
scriptures for them?

22:37.189 --> 22:39.057
<i>That's not why</i>
<i>we call him holy water.</i>

22:39.157 --> 22:40.158
<i>Oh!</i>

22:40.225 --> 22:42.227
<i>- Ask Trish.</i>
<i>- Ask Trish.</i>

22:42.327 --> 22:43.929
<i>Trish: It's his presence to me,</i>
<i>yeah.</i>

22:44.029 --> 22:45.430
<i>Like he walks in</i>
<i>like a presence.</i>

22:45.530 --> 22:47.199
<i>I said everybody's gonna be</i>
<i>blessed if he's here.</i>

22:47.265 --> 22:50.102
That one just kind of
came out this morning, so...

22:52.404 --> 22:53.939
<i>Troy, how you feeling?</i>

22:54.039 --> 22:57.376
You know, I know that you kind
of have your eyes on Karen.

22:57.442 --> 22:58.777
<i>I think</i>
<i>it's pretty obvious.</i>

22:58.877 --> 23:02.114
<i>Are you all right</i>
<i>with this little pairing?</i>

23:02.214 --> 23:03.615
<i>I give you my blessing.</i>

23:03.715 --> 23:06.518
<i>I hope that you guys</i>
<i>have an amazing time.</i>

23:06.585 --> 23:08.286
<i>Liar.</i>

23:08.387 --> 23:09.588
<i>Sorry.</i>

23:11.223 --> 23:13.859
If you ask me, would I want
to be doing some paddleboarding

23:13.925 --> 23:17.195
<i>and yoga stuff</i>
<i>with Karen? Sure.</i>

23:17.262 --> 23:18.697
<i>Noah: I feel like we have</i>
<i>a lot more power</i>

23:18.764 --> 23:20.465
<i>than we actually</i>
<i>initially thought.</i>

23:20.565 --> 23:23.201
<i>- Do you kinda feel bad?</i>
<i>- Yeah, I kind of feel bad.</i>

23:23.268 --> 23:24.903
<i>Like, I feel bad, like,</i>
<i>splitting up</i>

23:24.970 --> 23:26.972
<i>the parents that already, like</i>
<i>have connections and stuff.</i>

23:27.072 --> 23:28.640
<i>I think my dad wasn't really</i>
<i>taking the hint</i>

23:28.740 --> 23:31.143
<i>that he needs to, like,</i>
<i>not just focus on Karen.</i>

23:31.243 --> 23:33.311
<i>He's not thinking</i>
<i>of the fortune cookie.</i>

23:33.412 --> 23:35.313
<i>So you ate broccoli</i>
<i>for nothing.</i>

23:35.414 --> 23:37.416
<i>Oh, dude,</i>
<i>it's the hard-knock life.</i>

23:39.751 --> 23:40.886
<i>- So...</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

23:40.952 --> 23:42.487
<i>- ...that was interesting.</i>
<i>- Yeah, it was.</i>

23:42.587 --> 23:44.823
<i>I thought it was gonna be</i>
<i>you and me.</i>

23:44.923 --> 23:46.892
<i>Yes! I did, too.</i>

23:46.958 --> 23:48.660
<i>And I wish it was me,</i>
<i>just so you know.</i>

23:48.760 --> 23:50.762
<i>Someday they're gonna</i>
<i>give me a chance</i>

23:50.829 --> 23:52.230
<i>to have a legitimate date.</i>

23:52.297 --> 23:55.000
<i>I'm feeling a little conflicted</i>
<i>'cause obviously</i>

23:55.100 --> 23:57.002
<i>there's a tremendous attraction</i>

23:57.102 --> 24:00.005
<i>and there's so many things</i>
<i>in common with Troy.</i>

24:00.105 --> 24:02.774
<i>But I'm really gonna</i>
<i>be present for Philip,</i>

24:02.841 --> 24:04.910
<i>and just, it's about Philip,</i>
<i>it's about me,</i>

24:04.976 --> 24:06.445
<i>and that's what</i>
<i>I need to focus on</i>

24:06.511 --> 24:07.512
<i>and see where it can go.</i>

24:07.612 --> 24:08.847
<i>I mean, I'm totally cool</i>
<i>with it.</i>

24:08.947 --> 24:10.015
<i>You guys are gonna</i>
<i>have a great time.</i>

24:10.115 --> 24:11.450
<i>Absolutely.</i>

24:11.516 --> 24:12.851
<i>It'll be fun.</i>

24:12.951 --> 24:15.487
<i>of being here</i>
<i>and kind of exploring options.</i>

24:15.587 --> 24:17.522
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

24:17.622 --> 24:19.524
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

24:24.162 --> 24:26.097
<i>Scott: You're gonna head out</i>
<i>with Karen?</i>

24:26.164 --> 24:28.533
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

24:28.633 --> 24:30.001
<i>and, you know,</i>
<i>likes to have fun.</i>

24:30.101 --> 24:31.336
<i>I'm excited for you.</i>

24:31.436 --> 24:33.104
<i>I think you're gonna have</i>
<i>a fantastic time.</i>

24:33.171 --> 24:36.341
Something about her just looked
really beautiful to me.

24:36.441 --> 24:37.676
<i>Um...</i>

24:37.776 --> 24:39.778
<i>I mean, I think I got</i>
<i>some work to do</i>

24:39.845 --> 24:41.446
<i>to try to pull her</i>
<i>away from Troy.</i>

24:41.513 --> 24:43.515
<i>I mean, it's still early,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

24:43.615 --> 24:45.717
<i>Who knows how these</i>
<i>connections are gonna form?</i>

24:45.817 --> 24:47.385
<i>See where it goes, man.</i>
<i>You never know.</i>

24:47.486 --> 24:50.121
Maybe give her a little sip
of the holy water today, huh?

25:02.067 --> 25:04.736
<i>So, Alex, what's going on?</i>
<i>What's going on with you?</i>

25:04.836 --> 25:07.339
<i>Looks like they're hanging out</i>
<i>by the pool.</i>

25:07.405 --> 25:09.374
<i>- Yep.</i>
<i>- Is that Troy sunbathing?</i>

25:09.474 --> 25:10.809
<i>Yeah.</i>

25:10.876 --> 25:12.043
<i>He's just chilling.</i>

25:12.143 --> 25:13.745
<i>Noah:</i>
<i>Yeah, he's so relaxed.</i>

25:13.845 --> 25:16.748
<i>Do you have</i>
<i>matching swim trunks?</i>

25:16.848 --> 25:18.316
<i>No, we don't have matching</i>
<i>swim trunks.</i>

25:18.383 --> 25:19.718
<i>Alex: Are you sure?</i>

25:19.818 --> 25:21.152
<i>You definitely have</i>
<i>matching swim trunks, bro.</i>

25:21.219 --> 25:22.754
<i>I got way better style</i>
<i>than that guy.</i>

25:22.854 --> 25:24.689
I wouldn't be caught dead
wearing the same thing.

25:29.394 --> 25:31.229
<i>When was</i>
<i>your last relationship?</i>

25:31.563 --> 25:32.931
<i>Scott: Um...</i>

25:33.031 --> 25:35.667
You know, several times
in the last 10 years,

25:35.734 --> 25:38.770
<i>I have gotten back together</i>
<i>with my ex-wife.</i>

25:38.870 --> 25:40.071
<i>- Really?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

25:40.171 --> 25:42.874
<i>It sounds like</i>
<i>a serious conversation.</i>

25:42.941 --> 25:44.109
<i>MJ: Yeah.</i>

25:44.209 --> 25:46.077
<i>Scott: And during the --</i>
<i>I don't know.</i>

25:46.177 --> 25:48.280
<i>There was just a moment</i>
<i>I had an epiphany.</i>

25:48.380 --> 25:50.682
I don't know whether it's
the damage we had done

25:50.749 --> 25:53.685
<i>during our marriage</i>
<i>and breakups,</i>

25:53.752 --> 25:55.020
<i>but where I was just like,</i>

25:55.086 --> 25:56.621
<i>you know, we're just</i>
<i>not right together.</i>

25:56.721 --> 25:58.623
<i>How does she handle it</i>
<i>when you told her?</i>

25:58.723 --> 26:00.926
<i>Or was she in</i>
<i>the same place you were?</i>

26:01.026 --> 26:03.795
<i>You know, I didn't</i>
<i>communicate well.</i>

26:03.895 --> 26:05.130
<i>Mm.</i>

26:05.230 --> 26:06.798
<i>I was afraid</i>
<i>to express myself.</i>

26:06.898 --> 26:09.267
<i>You know,</i>
<i>I just didn't want to hurt her.</i>

26:09.367 --> 26:12.470
<i>But in the process,</i>
<i>I was hurting her even more</i>

26:12.571 --> 26:15.440
<i>and wronging her</i>
<i>even more, you know?</i>

26:15.540 --> 26:17.809
<i>This conversation</i>
<i>is a little --</i>

26:17.909 --> 26:19.311
<i>It's kind of a lot.</i>

26:19.411 --> 26:21.913
Yeah. We haven't really seen him
like that yet, have we?

26:21.980 --> 26:25.383
<i>It's weird hearing him</i>
<i>be so vulnerable.</i>

26:25.450 --> 26:27.485
<i>I think when guys</i>
<i>don't tell the truth,</i>

26:27.586 --> 26:30.155
or I guess people in general
don't tell the truth,

26:30.255 --> 26:32.090
<i>you feel blindsided.</i>

26:32.157 --> 26:35.493
Right? You know, I will
never live in that fear again,

26:35.594 --> 26:37.996
and how I handle those
situations will be different.

26:38.096 --> 26:39.898
And it goes the same way.
You know, like, look,

26:39.965 --> 26:41.499
<i>if you got something to tell me</i>
<i>and you know</i>

26:41.600 --> 26:43.768
it's not gonna make me
feel good, tell me anyways.

26:43.835 --> 26:45.403
<i>I don't have a problem</i>
<i>with that. </i>

26:45.470 --> 26:46.905
<i>Yeah, well, you know,</i>

26:46.972 --> 26:48.173
<i>that's the person</i>
<i>I choose to be with.</i>

26:48.273 --> 26:49.608
<i>I want them to be</i>
<i>my best friend,</i>

26:49.674 --> 26:51.509
<i>you know, that I can confide in</i>
<i>with anything,</i>

26:51.610 --> 26:53.178
<i>you know, good and bad.</i>

26:53.278 --> 26:56.681
<i>Scott was not my first choice.</i>
<i>Philip was.</i>

26:56.781 --> 27:00.418
<i>With Scott, I just really love</i>
<i>his honesty</i>

27:00.485 --> 27:03.955
<i>and his openness.</i>

27:04.022 --> 27:05.090
<i>Proud of you.</i>

27:05.156 --> 27:07.759
<i>- Oh, thank you.</i>

27:07.826 --> 27:10.261
<i>- Deneia's so nice.</i>

27:10.328 --> 27:12.364
<i>She is,</i>
<i>and so beautiful, too.</i>

27:12.464 --> 27:14.199
<i>- Thank you.</i>
<i>- Oh, whoa.</i>

27:14.299 --> 27:17.335
<i>- That was really sweet.</i>
<i>- Straightforward, yeah.</i>

27:17.435 --> 27:18.770
<i>That was super sweet.</i>

27:18.837 --> 27:21.206
<i>You guys want me</i>
<i>to go inside or...?</i>

27:22.707 --> 27:25.210
<i>I don't want to crowd</i>
<i>anybody's time here.</i>

27:25.310 --> 27:27.445
<i>Deneia's getting ready to</i>
<i>pounce, and I gotta cruise.</i>

27:27.512 --> 27:31.850
<i>My mom should, I guess, explore</i>
<i>if that's what she wants to do.</i>

27:31.950 --> 27:34.352
<i>But my mom and Scott --</i>
<i>I think they would have</i>

27:34.452 --> 27:39.324
<i>a better friendship</i>
<i>than a relationship.</i>

27:52.537 --> 27:55.340
<i>Phill shooting pool alone</i>
<i>again.</i>

27:55.407 --> 27:56.641
<i>Poor guy.</i>

27:56.708 --> 27:58.243
<i>He's the lonely</i>
<i>billiards player.</i>

27:58.343 --> 27:59.544
<i>I know.</i>

27:59.644 --> 28:01.546
<i>Well, he's cooler than I am</i>
<i>'cause I just go</i>

28:01.646 --> 28:04.249
and sulk in my bed,
apparently, by myself.

28:04.349 --> 28:05.817
<i>Nobody loves me.</i>

28:09.854 --> 28:11.723
<i>- Road trip.</i>
<i>- I'm so excited.</i>

28:11.823 --> 28:13.091
<i>Should be fun.</i>

28:13.191 --> 28:16.528
<i>Going undercover on this</i>
<i>off-site date with PJ</i>

28:16.594 --> 28:18.229
<i>is gonna be really fun.</i>

28:18.329 --> 28:19.931
<i>Let's watch them</i>
<i>fall in that water.</i>

28:21.566 --> 28:23.735
<i>My dad is, like, one of</i>
<i>the nicest people that I know.</i>

28:23.835 --> 28:26.037
<i>He's very positive.</i>
<i>He likes to have a good time.</i>

28:26.104 --> 28:27.238
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

28:27.338 --> 28:28.606
<i>And, you know,</i>
<i>he's a good-looking dude.</i>

28:28.707 --> 28:30.041
<i>He's 56 with a six-pack.</i>

28:30.108 --> 28:33.111
<i>So I'm hoping my dad</i>
<i>and Karen hit it off.</i>

28:33.211 --> 28:34.913
<i>I want to see him</i>
<i>build some connections.</i>

28:39.884 --> 28:43.188
<i>Perfect day to paddleboard.</i>

28:43.254 --> 28:45.523
<i>Welcome. I'm Sarah.</i>

28:45.590 --> 28:47.192
<i>- I'm Breana.</i>
<i>- Nice to meet you.</i>

28:47.258 --> 28:48.893
<i>- I'm PJ.</i>
<i>- Nice to meet you.</i>

28:48.960 --> 28:50.528
<i>PJ: Okay, so our parents</i>
<i>are in a retreat right now,</i>

28:50.595 --> 28:52.430
<i>and they have no idea</i>
<i>that we're meddling</i>

28:52.530 --> 28:53.965
<i>in their dates</i>
<i>and their love life.</i>

28:54.065 --> 28:55.967
<i>I like it.</i>

28:56.067 --> 28:57.302
<i>through</i>
<i>the walkie-talkie,</i>

28:57.402 --> 28:58.903
<i>and we're gonna</i>
<i>put this in your ear</i>

28:58.970 --> 29:00.405
<i>so you can hear us.</i>

29:00.472 --> 29:02.307
<i>Do we want them</i>
<i>to fall into the water today?</i>

29:02.407 --> 29:04.476
<i>- I think yeah.</i>
<i>- Awesome. Let's do it.</i>

29:04.576 --> 29:06.111
<i>PJ: Talk to you soon.</i>

29:07.879 --> 29:09.481
<i>Breana: I'm really protective</i>
<i>over my mom</i>

29:09.581 --> 29:12.150
<i>because I saw all the hurt</i>
<i>that she went through</i>

29:12.250 --> 29:13.485
<i>through the divorce</i>

29:13.585 --> 29:16.721
<i>and through her relationships</i>
<i>after that.</i>

29:16.788 --> 29:18.289
<i>And just the most</i>
<i>important thing</i>

29:18.389 --> 29:21.159
<i>is that I find someone</i>
<i>who truly loves my mom</i>

29:21.259 --> 29:22.827
<i>who is gonna</i>
<i>really treat her right.</i>

29:22.927 --> 29:25.897
<i>Breana: Oh, what are these?</i>
<i>Yoga poses?</i>

29:25.964 --> 29:28.133
<i>No, no, no.</i>

29:28.233 --> 29:30.335
<i>Oh. Oh, my God.</i>

29:30.435 --> 29:33.271
<i>"Yab Yum"?</i>

29:33.338 --> 29:34.839
<i>Oh, wait.</i>
<i>I hear my dad.</i>

29:34.939 --> 29:36.074
<i>Oh.</i>

29:36.141 --> 29:38.810
<i>- Let me help you out.</i>
<i>- Thank you.</i>

29:38.910 --> 29:40.311
<i>- Oh, that was nice.</i>
<i>- Good job, Dad.</i>

29:40.411 --> 29:42.347
<i>Such a gentleman.</i>

29:42.447 --> 29:45.583
<i>- Wow. This is awesome!</i>
<i>- Wow. Look at this.</i>

29:45.650 --> 29:46.684
<i>- Yeah.</i>
<i>- The views. It's beautiful.</i>

29:46.785 --> 29:48.920
<i>- Yes.</i>
<i>- Wow.</i>

29:48.987 --> 29:50.688
<i>Oh, I think I saw our</i>
<i>instructor.</i>

29:50.789 --> 29:52.023
<i>- Hi. Welcome.</i>
<i>- Hi.</i>

29:52.123 --> 29:53.458
<i>- Thank you.</i>
<i>- How are you guys?</i>

29:53.525 --> 29:55.360
<i>- Good. How are you?</i>
<i>- Good. My name's Sarah.</i>

29:55.460 --> 29:56.661
<i>I'm Karen.</i>
<i>Nice to meet you.</i>

29:56.761 --> 29:58.463
<i>- I'm Philip.</i>
<i>- Nice to meet you.</i>

29:58.530 --> 30:00.665
- <i>All right. Let's do it.</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

30:00.765 --> 30:02.367
<i>Off they go.</i>

30:03.701 --> 30:06.805
<i>Philip:</i>
<i>Paddleboard yoga on a date</i>

30:06.871 --> 30:09.541
<i>is something</i>
<i>I didn't know existed.</i>

30:09.641 --> 30:11.342
<i>I've paddleboarded before.</i>

30:11.442 --> 30:14.179
<i>Yoga I've done, like,</i>
<i>once in my life.</i>

30:14.279 --> 30:17.048
<i>So, you know,</i>
<i>the combination --</i>

30:17.148 --> 30:18.950
<i>it really actually</i>
<i>makes me kind of nervous.</i>

30:24.656 --> 30:26.558
<i>Ooh, I did not</i>
<i>see that coming.</i>

30:26.658 --> 30:27.992
<i>How about you and the girls?</i>

30:28.059 --> 30:29.460
<i>How do you feel about the girls,</i>
<i>like, for real?</i>

30:29.527 --> 30:30.895
<i>- I love them.</i>
<i>- You love them?</i>

30:30.995 --> 30:33.331
I love them. I feel like
there's not a single thing

30:33.398 --> 30:37.235
I haven't shared with
someone here, especially you.

30:37.335 --> 30:39.838
<i>Yeah, we've definitely been</i>
<i>pretty honest...</i>

30:39.904 --> 30:42.507
<i>Yeah.</i>

30:42.574 --> 30:44.409
<i>I'm never this vulnerable.</i>

30:44.509 --> 30:47.645
<i>It's a little weird.</i>

30:47.712 --> 30:50.481
<i>I like to daydream about having</i>
<i>a relationship with Alex.</i>

30:50.548 --> 30:52.317
<i>Oh, my God, Alex.</i>

30:52.383 --> 30:53.751
<i>Don't look at me like that.</i>
<i>I can't.</i>

30:53.852 --> 30:55.553
<i>Okay, I'll turn away.</i>

30:55.653 --> 30:58.756
<i>Noah: I find her extremely</i>
<i>attractive.</i>

30:58.857 --> 31:00.024
<i>When we talk, it's just like,</i>

31:00.091 --> 31:01.392
<i>I'm super comfortable</i>
<i>around her.</i>

31:01.492 --> 31:02.861
<i>And you don't find that</i>
<i>very often,</i>

31:02.927 --> 31:04.596
<i>especially</i>
<i>in a romantic situation.</i>

31:04.696 --> 31:07.232
<i>When I wake up and your head</i>
<i>is right there,</i>

31:07.332 --> 31:08.600
<i>I'm just like, wow.</i>

31:08.700 --> 31:10.101
<i>Last night I flipped around,</i>
<i>and you're like,</i>

31:10.201 --> 31:11.502
<i>"Oh, you just want to</i>
<i>be close to me?"</i>

31:11.569 --> 31:12.670
<i>And I was like,</i>
<i>"That could be it."</i>

31:12.737 --> 31:14.606
<i>Real smooth.</i>

31:14.706 --> 31:16.107
<i>I -- </i>

31:16.207 --> 31:18.776
<i>I'm not the smoothest guy</i>
<i>in the world all the time,</i>

31:18.877 --> 31:21.546
<i>but, uh...</i>

31:21.613 --> 31:27.452
<i>I'm not expecting any romance</i>
<i>out of this experience.</i>

31:27.552 --> 31:30.255
<i>But...</i>

31:30.355 --> 31:33.124
<i>I-I guess things happen.</i>

31:33.224 --> 31:36.394
<i>What year did you graduate</i>
<i>high school?</i>

31:36.961 --> 31:39.230
<i>Uh...</i>

31:39.297 --> 31:42.600
<i>2021.</i>

31:42.700 --> 31:44.602
<i>And you graduated</i>
<i>college --</i>

31:44.702 --> 31:46.304
<i>when did you</i>
<i>graduate college?</i>

31:46.404 --> 31:47.872
<i>In 2020.</i>

31:47.939 --> 31:49.874
<i>I mean, mentally,</i>
<i>I'm like 25 now.</i>

31:49.941 --> 31:52.043
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

31:52.110 --> 31:55.146
Yeah, so I'm not a cougar.
It's cool. It's cool.

31:55.246 --> 31:56.981
<i>But does that mean</i>
<i>you're coming on to me?</i>

31:57.081 --> 31:58.650
<i>No.</i>

31:58.750 --> 32:01.552
<i>No.</i>

32:03.087 --> 32:07.759
<i>On the surface,</i>
<i>Noah is an energetic kid,</i>

32:07.825 --> 32:11.462
<i>but once you spend</i>
<i>a little more time with him</i>

32:11.562 --> 32:14.999
<i>and start getting into</i>
<i>deeper conversations,</i>

32:15.099 --> 32:16.901
<i>there's so much more to him,</i>

32:16.968 --> 32:22.674
<i>and it definitely made me see</i>
<i>him in a whole new perspective.</i>

32:25.143 --> 32:27.245
<i>- Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.</i>
<i>- You're okay.</i>

32:28.646 --> 32:30.181
<i>Once he starts falling</i>
<i>and getting nervous.</i>

32:30.281 --> 32:32.350
<i>Sarah: You got it. You got it.</i>
<i>We're clearing the boats.</i>

32:32.450 --> 32:34.252
<i>Karen: I don't know</i>
<i>if Philip paddleboards.</i>

32:34.319 --> 32:35.687
<i>Your thing's in my way.</i>

32:35.787 --> 32:37.956
<i>We're gonna see if maybe</i>
<i>I have to save him.</i>

32:38.022 --> 32:39.691
<i>He might have to save me.</i>
<i>I don't know.</i>

32:39.791 --> 32:41.626
Okay, you got to come on
over here. Where you going?

32:41.693 --> 32:42.927
<i>I'm trying!</i>

32:42.994 --> 32:44.529
<i>Hey!</i>
<i>Where you going?</i>

32:44.629 --> 32:48.199
<i>It feels great to be doing</i>
<i>something new and different.</i>

32:48.299 --> 32:50.335
<i>Hold on.</i>

32:50.435 --> 32:52.971
<i>that's actually the part</i>
<i>that I'm excited about.</i>

32:53.037 --> 32:54.339
<i>PJ: He's getting a workout</i>
<i>over there.</i>

32:54.439 --> 32:57.709
<i>Oh, wait.</i>
<i>We can see them right there.</i>

32:57.809 --> 32:59.043
<i>Really?</i>
<i>You see them?</i>

32:59.143 --> 33:01.112
<i>Yeah, I see them.</i>

33:01.179 --> 33:04.048
<i>Looks like some kind of</i>
<i>Greek god or something.</i>

33:04.148 --> 33:06.150
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa.</i>
<i>Sorry. </i>

33:06.217 --> 33:10.822
Sarah, ask them what first
attracted them to each other.

33:10.888 --> 33:13.658
<i>- So, both single parents.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

33:13.725 --> 33:16.227
<i>- Both single ready to mingle?</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

33:16.327 --> 33:17.962
<i>Oh, she's fantastic.</i>

33:18.029 --> 33:21.199
What was it, though, that
attracted you to each other?

33:21.299 --> 33:23.401
<i>- My God, look at him.</i>
<i>- Well, I know.</i>

33:23.501 --> 33:25.737
I could totally answer
that question for both of you.

33:25.837 --> 33:29.173
In my case, we were on
the dance floor the other night,

33:29.240 --> 33:31.576
<i>and it just --</i>
<i>we were kind of connecting...</i>

33:31.676 --> 33:34.078
<i>...and just -- it just felt</i>
<i>right at the time.</i>

33:34.178 --> 33:35.546
<i>I love that.</i>

33:35.646 --> 33:36.914
I mean, she's been
feeling this other guy,

33:37.015 --> 33:38.182
<i>to tell you the truth.</i>

33:39.550 --> 33:42.587
<i>After that whole speech?</i>
<i>Forget that guy.</i>

33:42.687 --> 33:45.923
<i>I'm open.</i>
<i>That's why I'm here, so...</i>

33:46.024 --> 33:48.726
<i>Hopefully she's keeping</i>
<i>her options open.</i>

33:48.826 --> 33:51.929
<i>Philip is not the type of guy</i>
<i>that she would usually go for.</i>

33:52.030 --> 33:53.898
<i>He's a little more reserved,</i>

33:53.998 --> 33:56.601
<i>but maybe opposites</i>
<i>could attract.</i>

33:56.701 --> 33:59.270
Hey, Sarah, can you put them
on the same board now?

33:59.370 --> 34:01.272
<i>We're gonna</i>
<i>move on to one board.</i>

34:01.372 --> 34:03.174
Are you sure we got
enough room for that?

34:03.241 --> 34:05.009
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

34:05.076 --> 34:06.444
<i>I...</i>

34:06.544 --> 34:08.012
<i>- I'm coming over.</i>
<i>- Let's get you -- okay.</i>

34:08.079 --> 34:10.014
<i>Come on slow, though.</i>
<i>Come on, now.</i>

34:13.885 --> 34:15.453
<i>There you go.</i>
<i>There you go.</i>

34:15.553 --> 34:16.721
<i>Karen: There we go.</i>

34:16.788 --> 34:18.623
<i>We're gonna do child pose</i>
<i>meets fish.</i>

34:18.723 --> 34:21.592
<i>Sarah: So, Philip,</i>
<i>what you're going to do</i>

34:21.692 --> 34:23.895
<i>is come into child's pose.</i>

34:23.961 --> 34:26.564
<i>You have it,</i>
<i>slow and gentle.</i>

34:26.631 --> 34:28.966
<i>We're getting some water</i>
<i>coming in here.</i>

34:29.067 --> 34:30.935
<i>Oh, they're sinking it.</i>

34:31.035 --> 34:32.136
<i>Philip:</i>
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh.</i>

34:32.236 --> 34:33.971
<i>Now, so what you're gonna</i>
<i>do, Karen,</i>

34:34.072 --> 34:38.076
<i>is you're gonna sit</i>
<i>basically up onto him.</i>

34:38.142 --> 34:39.377
<i>- Whoa, whoa, whoa.</i>
<i>- Aah!</i>

34:39.444 --> 34:42.980
<i>- Whoa.</i>
<i>- Then I want you to lie back.</i>

34:43.081 --> 34:45.817
<i>Yes, just keep moving</i>
<i>that slow.</i>

34:48.920 --> 34:51.989
<i>Now I'll start to</i>
<i>lean back.</i>

34:52.090 --> 34:53.925
<i>- You guys doing amazing.</i>

34:53.991 --> 34:56.594
<i>- Oh, wow, they did it.</i>
<i>- Oh, okay.</i>

34:56.661 --> 34:59.730
<i>Let's breathe together.</i>
<i>Inhale.</i>

34:59.797 --> 35:01.732
<i>Exhale.</i>

35:01.799 --> 35:03.000
<i>I think</i>
<i>this is a good date.</i>

35:03.101 --> 35:04.335
<i>This is a good date.</i>

35:04.435 --> 35:06.504
<i>They're getting along</i>
<i>really, really well.</i>

35:06.604 --> 35:08.339
<i>He's gonna give Troy</i>
<i>a run for his money.</i>

35:08.439 --> 35:10.408
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>
<i>Troy need to watch out, man.</i>

35:10.475 --> 35:12.343
<i>My dad is --</i>
<i>once he gets comfortable,</i>

35:12.443 --> 35:14.011
<i>he's a force</i>
<i>to be reckoned with.</i>

35:14.112 --> 35:15.847
<i>Sarah: Inhale.</i>

35:15.947 --> 35:17.448
<i>- Wow. Wow.</i>
<i>- Yes. Exhale.</i>

35:17.515 --> 35:20.251
<i>This is an amazing view</i>
<i>right here.</i>

35:20.318 --> 35:22.653
<i>- Oh, no.</i>
<i>- Ugh. Wow.</i>

35:22.753 --> 35:24.021
<i>Okay, okay, okay.</i>

35:24.122 --> 35:25.656
<i>do you know how to do</i>
<i>headstands?</i>

35:25.756 --> 35:27.458
<i>- No.</i>
<i>- Oh, make her do one.</i>

35:27.525 --> 35:29.093
<i>- I got you.</i>
<i>- You</i> <i> do it.</i>

35:30.161 --> 35:32.763
<i>Impress me.</i>
<i>Turn me on.</i>

35:32.830 --> 35:34.632
<i>Impress me</i>
<i>with that headstand.</i>

35:34.699 --> 35:37.135
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

35:37.201 --> 35:38.703
<i>She's gonna freak out</i>
<i>once she knows</i>

35:38.803 --> 35:40.605
I'm literally watching her
say all these things.

35:41.873 --> 35:43.341
<i>You got it.</i>
<i>You got it.</i>

35:43.441 --> 35:44.876
<i>- Ah!</i>
<i>- Oh, shoot. Oh, shoot.</i>

35:44.976 --> 35:47.211
<i>- Oh!</i>

35:47.311 --> 35:49.213
<i>Ah, man!</i>

35:49.313 --> 35:51.516
<i>Sarah, we're gonna have him</i>
<i>do camel pose.</i>

35:51.616 --> 35:53.551
<i>Sarah: I got one more pose</i>
<i>for you.</i>

35:53.651 --> 35:55.786
<i>You're coming in</i>
<i>super</i> <i> close.</i>

35:55.853 --> 35:57.522
<i>I like that.</i>

35:59.323 --> 36:00.958
<i>- Oh, whoa, whoa!</i>
<i>- Oh!</i>

36:03.528 --> 36:06.197
<i>He's having a lot of fun, man.</i>
<i>This is great.</i>

36:06.297 --> 36:08.900
<i>Hey, yo!</i>

36:09.000 --> 36:11.035
<i>- Whoa, whoa, whoa!</i>
<i>- Philip! Philip!</i>

36:13.971 --> 36:15.473
<i>- Whoa!</i>
<i>- Oh! There we go.</i>

36:15.540 --> 36:17.642
<i>- Whoo! There we go!</i>
<i>- There it is.</i>

36:17.708 --> 36:19.810
<i>- Aah!</i>
<i>- End it with a bang.</i>

36:19.877 --> 36:22.647
<i>- It's freezing!</i>
<i>- Okay, let's get in the water.</i>

36:22.713 --> 36:23.881
<i>- Aah!</i>
<i>- That was good.</i>

36:23.981 --> 36:25.082
<i>That was a good way</i>
<i>to end it.</i>

36:26.517 --> 36:28.386
<i>Philip:</i>
<i>Doing something like that --</i>

36:28.486 --> 36:30.321
<i>just, I felt like it</i>
<i>just brought us together</i>

36:30.388 --> 36:32.023
<i>in a way</i>
<i>that hadn't happened before.</i>

36:32.089 --> 36:34.225
<i>It felt warm.</i>
<i>That felt good.</i>

36:34.325 --> 36:37.695
<i>I'm more attracted to Karen now</i>
<i>after this date, for sure.</i>

36:37.762 --> 36:39.363
<i>Karen: That was amazing.</i>
<i>Thank you, Sarah.</i>

36:39.430 --> 36:40.731
<i>Sarah: You're welcome.</i>

36:40.831 --> 36:43.034
<i>The paddleboard date</i>
<i>with Philip was amazing.</i>

36:43.100 --> 36:45.403
<i>I definitely enjoyed</i>
<i>this experience with Philip.</i>

36:45.503 --> 36:47.772
<i>But I may be thinking</i>
<i>a little bit about Troy</i>

36:47.872 --> 36:50.675
<i>while I'm on this date,</i>
<i>which makes it a little awkward.</i>

37:00.885 --> 37:02.787
<i>- You look really cute.</i>
<i>- Thank you.</i>

37:02.887 --> 37:04.055
<i>Wait.</i>
<i>All the way...</i>

37:07.058 --> 37:08.793
<i>Yo, we got a meddle!</i>

37:09.927 --> 37:12.129
<i>"Now is your chance</i>
<i>to turn up the heat</i>

37:12.230 --> 37:14.365
<i>and learn more about</i>
<i>your parents.</i>

37:14.432 --> 37:18.736
<i>Option A -- Send in a spicy game</i>
<i>of Truth or Dare."</i>

37:18.803 --> 37:23.140
"Or Option B -- Have your
parents play Spin the Bottle."

37:23.241 --> 37:25.309
<i>- Oh, my God.</i>
<i>- Oh!</i>

37:25.409 --> 37:27.979
I think Truth or Dare
might be the safe option.

37:28.079 --> 37:30.114
<i>Yeah, I don't want to see</i>
<i>none of the parents kissing.</i>

37:30.214 --> 37:31.882
<i>And it says spicy game</i>
<i>of Truth or Dare,</i>

37:31.949 --> 37:33.317
<i>so it won't be</i>
<i>a boring one.</i>

37:33.417 --> 37:35.319
This is the most likely
to not kiss option.

37:35.419 --> 37:37.722
<i>- Yeah, let's save our eyes.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

37:37.788 --> 37:41.259
<i>MJ:</i>
<i>All aboard for Option A?</i>

37:41.325 --> 37:43.427
<i>All opposed?</i>

37:43.494 --> 37:44.495
<i>All right, so Option A.</i>

37:44.595 --> 37:46.230
<i>- Okay.</i>
<i>- Wait a second.</i>

37:46.297 --> 37:48.399
<i>MJ: Oh! I forgot.</i>

37:51.102 --> 37:53.137
- <i>Oh!</i>
<i>- Oh!</i>

37:57.908 --> 38:00.311
<i>Hell no! Hell no!</i>

38:00.411 --> 38:01.812
<i>Forget the game!</i>

38:01.912 --> 38:04.415
<i>Myles, you have like 20 pairs.</i>
<i>You can sacrifice 5.</i>

38:04.482 --> 38:05.583
<i>Yes!</i>

38:05.650 --> 38:09.020
<i>Noah:</i>
<i>Do you wish to proceed, Myles?</i>

38:10.855 --> 38:12.423
<i>You have so many shoes.</i>

38:12.490 --> 38:15.026
Yeah, but I-I like them
for certain outfits.

38:15.126 --> 38:17.028
<i>Dude, those off-whites</i>
<i>would go with anything.</i>

38:17.128 --> 38:19.030
<i>But they're $1,400.</i>

38:19.130 --> 38:20.698
<i>I don't want to wear them</i>
<i>with everything.</i>

38:20.798 --> 38:22.800
I only have four pairs of shoes,
and I'd give them all up.

38:22.867 --> 38:24.001
<i>- Myles. Yeah.</i>
<i>- I'd go barefoot.</i>

38:24.101 --> 38:25.336
<i>My shoes mean a lot to me.</i>

38:25.436 --> 38:27.038
<i>I brought them for a reason,</i>

38:27.138 --> 38:29.774
<i>so I could drip out</i>
<i>in some clothes.</i>

38:39.884 --> 38:41.886
<i>That's a yes.</i>

38:43.988 --> 38:45.990
<i>Whitney:</i>
<i>Good job, Myles, good job.</i>

38:46.057 --> 38:47.725
<i>Thank you, Myles!</i>
<i>You're great.</i>

38:47.825 --> 38:48.893
<i>MJ: Aah!</i>

38:48.993 --> 38:51.329
<i>- You hear him scream?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

38:51.395 --> 38:54.165
<i>Oh.</i>

38:54.231 --> 38:57.201
<i>- Oh!</i>
<i>- You're sad.</i>

38:57.301 --> 39:00.237
<i>Noah: Which one -- can you show</i>
<i>us which ones you gave up?</i>

39:00.338 --> 39:01.572
<i>MJ: I'm sad.</i>

39:01.672 --> 39:02.907
<i>You never know what can happen</i>

39:03.007 --> 39:06.911
<i>when five pairs of shoes</i>
<i>are just...gone.</i>

39:07.011 --> 39:08.045
<i>Are you okay?</i>

39:08.145 --> 39:09.747
<i>They could be creased.</i>

39:09.847 --> 39:12.183
<i>They can be messed up,</i>
<i>get a little dirt on them.</i>

39:15.419 --> 39:18.656
<i>This is -- I don't really know</i>
<i>what to do here.</i>

39:18.723 --> 39:21.192
<i>Do you want, like,</i>
<i>a snack?</i>

39:21.258 --> 39:22.760
<i>Whitney:</i>
<i>Chocolate milk?</i>

39:22.860 --> 39:25.429
<i>And I don't trust anyone else</i>
<i>on my shoes but me.</i>

39:25.529 --> 39:27.598
<i>Do you need a hug?</i>

39:36.040 --> 39:38.843
So how many hours do the
18 holes take you in general?

39:38.909 --> 39:41.579
<i>Depends on how the course is</i>
<i>and how backed it is.</i>

39:41.679 --> 39:43.047
<i>Plus, we always have</i>
<i>extra stuff --</i>

39:43.114 --> 39:46.784
<i>coolers full of waters</i>
<i>and tunes going.</i>

39:46.884 --> 39:48.285
<i>Oh, you can play music</i>
<i>on a golf course?</i>

39:48.386 --> 39:49.720
<i>- Oh, yeah.</i>
<i>- I didn't know that.</i>

39:49.787 --> 39:51.589
<i>You're not supposed to.</i>
<i>but these guys...</i>

39:53.090 --> 39:55.192
<i>- What are they drinking?</i>
<i>- Water.</i>

39:55.259 --> 39:58.596
<i>- Tequila.</i>
<i>- Water.</i>

39:58.696 --> 40:00.131
<i>So what do you think</i>
<i>the kids are doing?</i>

40:02.466 --> 40:03.634
<i>- Oh!</i>
<i>- Oh!</i>

40:03.734 --> 40:05.202
<i>Whitney:</i>
<i>Thank you, Myles.</i>

40:05.269 --> 40:06.937
<i>Noah: This is when we find out</i>
<i>if it was worth it.</i>

40:07.037 --> 40:08.472
<i>- Yeah.</i>
<i>- And if it wasn't...</i>

40:08.572 --> 40:11.308
<i>we're all gonna feel, like,</i>
<i>horrible about ourselves.</i>

40:11.409 --> 40:12.943
<i>- Ooh!</i>
<i>- Wow!</i>

40:13.043 --> 40:14.578
<i>- Jimmy's back again.</i>
<i>- Yeah!</i>

40:14.645 --> 40:15.646
<i>Oh.</i>

40:15.746 --> 40:18.149
<i>We have a fun little activity</i>

40:18.249 --> 40:19.950
<i>that our dating consultants</i>
<i>planned --</i>

40:20.050 --> 40:22.052
<i>a little game</i>
<i>you might have heard of</i>

40:22.119 --> 40:24.488
<i>called Truth or Dare.</i>

40:24.588 --> 40:26.223
<i>- Oh!</i>
<i>- Oh!</i>

40:26.290 --> 40:28.392
<i>Spicy Truth or Dare.</i>

40:28.459 --> 40:31.495
<i>The pink jar has</i>
<i>all the truth questions.</i>

40:31.595 --> 40:33.831
<i>The purple jar has</i>
<i>all the dare questions.</i>

40:33.931 --> 40:35.833
<i>I'm gonna go ahead</i>
<i>and put this in the center.</i>

40:35.933 --> 40:37.668
<i>Oh, they're probably</i>
<i>super nervous now.</i>

40:37.768 --> 40:39.069
<i>- Oh, God.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

40:39.136 --> 40:40.438
<i>- Thank you, Jimmy.</i>
<i>- All right, bye, you guys.</i>

40:40.504 --> 40:42.506
<i>- Thank you, Jimmy.</i>
<i>- Bye.</i>

40:43.441 --> 40:46.744
<i>Truth or dare...Troy?</i>

40:46.811 --> 40:48.112
<i>You know what?</i>
<i>I'm gonna try a dare.</i>

40:48.179 --> 40:49.580
<i>- Oh, my God.</i>
<i>- Let's go, Dad!</i>

40:49.647 --> 40:51.415
<i>- Good job, Troy.</i>
<i>- That's what we like.</i>

40:51.482 --> 40:53.317
<i>- Good job, Troy.</i>
<i>- That's what it's about.</i>

40:53.417 --> 40:56.854
<i>- What is he gonna have to do?</i>
<i>- Oh, God.</i>

40:58.022 --> 41:00.324
<i>"Use your tongue</i>

41:00.424 --> 41:02.526
<i>to write your name</i>
<i>on someone's arm."</i>

41:04.595 --> 41:07.331
<i>Oh, that's super weird.</i>

41:07.431 --> 41:09.633
<i>- Aah!</i>
<i>- Sorry, fellas.</i>

41:12.269 --> 41:15.139
<i>Troy: Trish, roll up</i>
<i>that sleeve.</i>

41:15.206 --> 41:16.540
<i>I'm coming in.</i>

41:16.640 --> 41:18.943
<i>I don't want to see this!</i>

41:19.009 --> 41:21.212
<i>- Oh!</i>
<i>- Eeee!</i>

41:21.312 --> 41:25.316
<i>Ah, ah, ah.</i>

41:25.382 --> 41:27.351
<i>Dad! Oh, God!</i>

41:27.451 --> 41:30.054
<i>- Dude.</i>
<i>- Ew!</i>

41:33.491 --> 41:35.025
<i>Here you go.</i>

41:36.193 --> 41:37.862
<i>Ah!</i>

41:37.962 --> 41:40.030
<i>- Oh!</i>
<i>- Mom's embarrassed.</i>

41:40.130 --> 41:41.232
<i>Bless her little heart.</i>

41:41.332 --> 41:42.900
<i>Trish: Okay, Phill,</i>
<i>truth or dare?</i>

41:43.000 --> 41:46.170
<i>What you think, guys?</i>
<i>Take one for the team.</i>

41:46.237 --> 41:48.205
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>
<i>- Oh, I'm scared.</i>

41:48.305 --> 41:50.174
<i>- How bad is it?</i>

41:50.241 --> 41:52.543
<i>- It's not that bad.</i>
<i>- It's always bad.</i>

41:52.643 --> 41:56.747
<i>"Feed someone else</i>
<i>using only...</i>

41:56.847 --> 41:58.482
<i>your mouth."</i>

41:58.549 --> 42:00.751
<i>- Good luck with that, girls.</i>

42:02.753 --> 42:04.421
<i>Get something long...</i>

42:04.522 --> 42:06.824
<i>...like a Twizzler or a piece</i>
<i>of spaghetti or something.</i>

42:06.891 --> 42:07.925
<i>Yeah.</i>

42:10.094 --> 42:11.662
<i>- Ahhhhhh!</i>
<i>- Who's more shy?</i>

42:11.729 --> 42:14.865
<i>- Yeah.</i>
<i>- Ahhhhh!</i>

42:14.932 --> 42:17.268
<i>- It's a banana!</i>
<i>- I thought it was a green apple.</i>

42:17.368 --> 42:19.403
<i>Don't bring nothing</i>
<i>over here!</i>

42:29.346 --> 42:30.948
<i>- Oh!</i>
<i>- Good job.</i>

42:31.048 --> 42:32.683
<i>- Okay, he didn't take it back.</i>
<i>- Good job!</i>

42:32.750 --> 42:34.118
<i>- There you go.</i>
<i>- Yay!</i>

42:34.218 --> 42:35.953
<i>- It wasn't that bad.</i>
<i>- Was it good for you?</i>

42:39.957 --> 42:42.459
<i>- Scotty, let's go.</i>
<i>- I said truth.</i>

42:42.560 --> 42:45.696
<i>He shouldn't be</i>
<i>doing truth, but...</i>

42:45.763 --> 42:48.299
<i>"What's the sexiest gift</i>

42:48.399 --> 42:49.934
<i>you've ever received?"</i>

42:50.034 --> 42:51.802
<i>Probably a cock ring.</i>

42:51.902 --> 42:53.604
<i>- Jesus.</i>
<i>- I knew he was gonna say that.</i>

42:53.704 --> 42:56.473
Did he just
come out with that?

42:56.574 --> 42:59.310
<i>A what? A cock ring?</i>

42:59.410 --> 43:01.579
<i>- Ew!</i>
<i>- A cock ring?</i>

43:01.645 --> 43:03.213
<i>Did he just say cock ring?</i>

43:03.280 --> 43:07.151
<i>It was a cock ring with</i>
<i>a little vibrator on the top.</i>

43:07.251 --> 43:08.719
<i>And he elaborates.</i>

43:08.786 --> 43:11.589
<i>- Ah, your dad has a cock ring.</i>
<i>- Oh, my God! Cock ring?</i>

43:11.655 --> 43:14.491
<i>I'm gonna cry.</i>
<i>That's disgusting.</i>

43:14.592 --> 43:15.793
<i>- Troy?</i>
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

43:15.893 --> 43:18.662
<i>"Sit on someone's lap</i>
<i>of your choice</i>

43:18.762 --> 43:21.732
<i>for the rest of the game."</i>

43:21.799 --> 43:23.167
<i>You can sit on my lap.</i>

43:23.267 --> 43:26.103
<i>I can tell you whose laps</i>
<i>I'm</i> <i> not</i> <i> sitting on.</i>

43:26.170 --> 43:28.739
<i>I've already licked</i>
<i>Trish's arm.</i>

43:28.806 --> 43:31.408
Oh, a car.
Who is that?

43:31.475 --> 43:33.077
<i>- It's Karen.</i>
<i>- Karen.</i>

43:35.179 --> 43:37.014
<i>I'm a pretty big guy.</i>

43:37.114 --> 43:38.916
<i>You're gonna have to hold up</i>
<i>some of your weight</i>

43:38.983 --> 43:40.584
<i>on your legs.</i>

43:40.651 --> 43:42.920
<i>- Be a good workout for you.</i>
<i>- I'm not gonna go full tank.</i>

43:42.987 --> 43:44.421
You don't want that.
That's too much weight.

43:44.488 --> 43:47.124
<i>Your mom's holding up</i>
<i>225 pounds right now.</i>

43:47.191 --> 43:48.792
<i>- Thank you.</i>
<i>- Oh, you're welcome.</i>

43:48.859 --> 43:50.861
<i>- I'm sorry I'm so heavy.</i>
<i>- You're not heavy.</i>

43:53.597 --> 43:55.199
<i>- Ah!</i>
<i>- What's going on?</i>

43:55.299 --> 43:58.102
<i>- Hello!</i>
<i>- It's the party crew.</i>

43:59.803 --> 44:02.473
<i>You took my place</i>
<i>already?</i>

44:02.539 --> 44:04.375
<i>Okay, what are you doing</i>
<i>in her lap?</i>
