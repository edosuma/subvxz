00:00.882 --> 00:02.512
My name is michael westen.

00:02.522 --> 00:05.141
I used to be a spy until...

00:05.151 --> 00:08.180
We got a burn notice on
you. You're blacklisted.

00:08.189 --> 00:10.489
When you're burned,you've
got nothing --

00:10.499 --> 00:12.998
no cash,no credit,no job history.

00:13.008 --> 00:15.228
You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.

00:15.238 --> 00:17.497
- Where am I?
- Miami.

00:17.507 --> 00:20.416
You do whatever work comes your way.

00:20.426 --> 00:23.725
You rely on anyone  who's
still talking to you.

00:23.745 --> 00:25.185
A trigger-happy
ex-girlfriend...

00:25.195 --> 00:26.344
should we shoot them?

00:26.354 --> 00:28.914
An old friend who used  to
inform on you to the fbi...

00:28.924 --> 00:31.663
you know spies -- a bunch
of bitchy little girls.

00:31.673 --> 00:32.403
Family,too...

00:32.412 --> 00:33.552
hey,is that your mom again?

00:33.562 --> 00:34.802
If you're desperate.

00:34.812 --> 00:36.301
Someone needs your help,michael.

00:36.311 --> 00:38.851
Bottom line --  as
long as you're burned...

00:38.891 --> 00:41.440
you're not going anywhere.

00:53.956 --> 00:57.225
There are advantages  to training
with someone  you're close to.

00:57.235 --> 01:00.284
Knowing each other's moves
makes training more effective.

01:00.294 --> 01:06.742
But being involved  in each other's personal
lives  can also make training  a lot more painful.

01:06.772 --> 01:08.382
Is there something you
want to talk about,fi?

01:08.392 --> 01:10.251
Not really.

01:11.031 --> 01:15.809
I know you're not thrilled about me
reaching out to the intelligence community.

01:15.819 --> 01:17.929
No. I don't have a problem with it.

01:17.939 --> 01:18.959
You want your old job back.

01:18.969 --> 01:21.188
I said I'd be supportive.

01:22.837 --> 01:24.277
Not a problem.

01:25.107 --> 01:26.556
Fi.

01:27.506 --> 01:29.425
Fiona!

01:30.485 --> 01:32.824
Are you expecting company?

01:51.999 --> 01:54.538
That's like two days' worth of yogurt.

01:55.528 --> 02:01.546
That is either a brilliantly disguised
bomb,or somebody knows the way to your heart.

02:01.556 --> 02:02.665
And they're shy.

02:02.675 --> 02:05.085
They didn't stick around.

02:06.024 --> 02:08.033
A thank-you gift from a client?

02:08.044 --> 02:10.633
Well,that's the most you've
ever been paid for a job.

02:10.643 --> 02:14.512
Pretty soon,you'll be able
to stop bumming money from me.

02:11.863 --> 02:14.042
{\a6}frozen yogurt,cocowalk 10AM,a friend

02:17.291 --> 02:19.850
It's a gift from your
agency friends,isn't it?

02:19.860 --> 02:21.660
Could be.

02:21.670 --> 02:23.599
Good for you.

02:23.609 --> 02:25.938
Looks like you're getting back in.

02:41.934 --> 02:45.233
Meeting a new operative  is a
lot like  going on a blind date.

02:45.243 --> 02:48.242
You're bound to be nervous  the
first couple of times  you do it.

02:48.252 --> 02:51.901
But live through a few,and
you get to be an expert.

02:53.780 --> 02:56.909
You should arrive
early,prepare an exit strategy,

02:56.919 --> 02:59.718
and know you could be
in  for an ugly surprise.

02:59.728 --> 03:03.277
You know,I figured you'd run surveillance
from the bistro 'cause of the sight lines,

03:03.287 --> 03:05.986
but,uh,you're the spy,right?

03:05.996 --> 03:07.076
This place is better.

03:07.086 --> 03:10.445
Better escape routes,better iced tea.

03:11.045 --> 03:12.574
So,michael,you like the yogurt?

03:12.584 --> 03:13.854
No,I haven't tried it yet.

03:13.864 --> 03:17.013
I was always taught "never
take yogurt from strangers.

03:17.023 --> 03:20.762
Well,let's not be strangers.

03:23.571 --> 03:25.840
Name's tom strickler.

03:27.600 --> 03:29.349
And what is it that you do,tom?

03:29.359 --> 03:31.099
Match people with opportunities.

03:31.109 --> 03:32.158
It's a bit like an agent.

03:32.168 --> 03:35.038
A man with your skills is extremely
valuable,as I'm sure you're aware,

03:35.048 --> 03:39.126
and,uh,I just make sure all
that doesn't go to waste.

03:39.156 --> 03:42.075
strickler agent to the spies

03:42.085 --> 03:46.554
You're operating in miami with no
resources,no operational support.

03:46.564 --> 03:48.204
That's no way to live.

03:48.214 --> 03:50.583
It's not safe,for you or
the people you care about.

03:50.593 --> 03:51.803
And you're the solution to that?

03:51.813 --> 03:53.852
Yeah. I'm not asking
you to change a thing.

03:53.862 --> 03:56.011
You get to just keep
doing what comes naturally.

03:56.021 --> 03:56.991
And what is that?

03:57.001 --> 03:58.580
Surviving.

03:58.590 --> 04:00.360
You're great at surviving.

04:00.370 --> 04:02.319
Now,you're a man with
enemies. We know that.

04:02.329 --> 04:05.119
But your enemies have
enemies of their own --

04:05.129 --> 04:08.178
people that'll pay to have you
take care of their problems.

04:08.188 --> 04:09.037
It's called synergy.

04:09.047 --> 04:11.407
The enemy of your enemy is
your financial opportunity.

04:11.417 --> 04:12.536
What's in it for you?

04:12.546 --> 04:13.656
10%.

04:13.666 --> 04:15.865
I'm putting together a
deal for you now,actually.

04:15.875 --> 04:21.144
I heard a rumor about,uh,an old associate
of yours who's making a move to miami.

04:21.154 --> 04:23.753
Figure the smart money's on
michael westen in that little fight.

04:23.763 --> 04:25.572
And you're the smart money.

04:25.582 --> 04:27.472
Any more details on this old associate?

04:27.482 --> 04:29.061
Still working on that.

04:29.071 --> 04:34.150
Apparently,there's some ukrainian who's
very upset about an op you ran in the '90s.

04:34.160 --> 04:35.989
I'll let you know more
as I get the details.

04:35.999 --> 04:37.699
Yeah,sorry. I'm not a killer for hire.

04:37.709 --> 04:39.368
Oh,well,let's not get
ahead of ourselves.

04:39.378 --> 04:41.678
This might be a killing
thing. It might not.

04:41.688 --> 04:44.397
Let me do my
homework,and,uh,we'll discuss.

04:44.407 --> 04:45.956
There's nothing to discuss.

04:45.966 --> 04:49.095
Well,the thing is,this guy's
coming one way or another --

04:49.105 --> 04:51.665
- tom...
- okay.

04:51.685 --> 04:54.594
Okay. You have my
number. We'll talk soon.

04:54.604 --> 04:58.033
Unless the ukrainian cuts
your tongue out first,right?

05:04.621 --> 05:06.920
So,who's the secret admirer?

05:06.930 --> 05:09.079
Whoever they are,they
have good taste in yogurt.

05:09.089 --> 05:10.659
His name's strickler.

05:10.669 --> 05:15.537
He says someone I crossed paths with in the
ukraine is in town,looking to settle an old score.

05:15.547 --> 05:17.747
And he's here to profit
from any bloodshed.

05:17.757 --> 05:18.406
Charming.

05:18.416 --> 05:19.886
Who's the ukrainian?

05:19.896 --> 05:22.435
Strickler claims not to
know,which is inconvenient,

05:22.445 --> 05:26.814
because there's quite a few people from that
region who would like to see me stop breathing.

05:28.853 --> 05:30.913
I know a guy.Goes by "beck."

05:30.923 --> 05:32.002
He might be able to help.

05:32.012 --> 05:35.491
He's made a lot of money for some
very powerful people over there.

05:35.501 --> 05:37.501
If there's a ukrainian in
town,he'll be able to fill you in.

05:37.511 --> 05:39.110
Based in miami?

05:39.650 --> 05:41.819
Started as a local
gangster and went big-time.

05:41.829 --> 05:46.918
He hijacks cargoand ships it,like
fedex with a kalashnikov set.

05:46.928 --> 05:51.007
He's about as connected as a miami
hustler who doesn't speak russian can get.

05:51.017 --> 05:53.076
Think you can get mea meeting?

05:53.796 --> 05:54.866
You might not want
meas your go-between.

05:54.876 --> 05:59.084
I may have intercepted a
coupleof his shipments once.

05:59.094 --> 06:01.903
Sparkly new p90s,michael.

06:01.913 --> 06:03.433
They deserved a good home.

06:03.443 --> 06:06.002
So I get to walk upto him cold? Great.

06:06.032 --> 06:07.742
Well,at least you'll
geta good cup of coffee.

06:07.752 --> 06:10.091
I know his favorite spot.

06:11.101 --> 06:12.600
Yeah,sam.

06:12.610 --> 06:14.760
Yeah,mike,uh,I'm at your mom'S.

06:14.770 --> 06:17.949
She got some curtainsfrom
a guy named tom strickler.

06:17.989 --> 06:20.228
Is this a business associateof yours?

06:20.238 --> 06:24.317
Put it this way --you know that broker
that contacted youin east germany in '89?

06:24.327 --> 06:28.945
Yeah,mueller --tried to pay me to "accidentally"
blow upa factory during an operation.

06:28.955 --> 06:29.805
Bloodsucker.

06:29.815 --> 06:31.355
I have my own parasite.

06:31.365 --> 06:33.444
Some ukrainian's in townlooking for me.

06:33.454 --> 06:35.073
If I can get to
himbefore he gets to me...

06:35.083 --> 06:38.192
strickler cuts you a check, and you're
one step closer to being a mercenary --

06:38.202 --> 06:39.022
what are you gonna do?

06:39.032 --> 06:42.161
Try and run down the
ukrainianthrough a contact of fi'S.

06:42.171 --> 06:43.531
Sam,can
you --

06:43.541 --> 06:46.350
check out strickler? I'm on it.

06:48.449 --> 06:50.009
No one else gave mea

06:50.039 --> 06:53.468
house-rewarming present,not
even the guywho blew up my house.

06:53.478 --> 06:55.497
Maddy,I thoughtwe were over that.

06:55.507 --> 06:57.827
Forgiveness is a process.

06:57.837 --> 07:00.856
Pick me up some curtain rods,and maybe.

07:00.866 --> 07:03.895
Fine. Curtain rods.You got it.

07:07.054 --> 07:10.823
The cold approach  is something you
try to avoid in intelligence work.

07:10.833 --> 07:14.102
You want to ease into a
relationship over time.

07:14.112 --> 07:19.300
When that's impossible,you just have to
turn on the charm  and hope for the best.

07:19.310 --> 07:21.290
John beck,right?

07:21.879 --> 07:22.979
Name is michael.

07:22.989 --> 07:25.458
I heard that you mightbe able to
help me with a little situation.

07:25.468 --> 07:27.358
Word is you'rea guy with connections.

07:27.368 --> 07:29.227
That's what they say.

07:29.237 --> 07:31.476
beck guy with connections

07:31.636 --> 07:33.106
I just needa little information.

07:33.116 --> 07:35.045
And why should igive it to you?

07:35.055 --> 07:36.425
I'm a good friend to have.

07:36.435 --> 07:37.845
Let me explainsomething to you,man.

07:37.855 --> 07:39.104
I don't have friends.

07:39.114 --> 07:40.324
I'm a businessman.

07:40.334 --> 07:42.433
I got rivals.I got associates.

07:42.443 --> 07:43.983
I even got a few enemies.

07:43.993 --> 07:48.471
But friends? Sorry.
That's not how I roll.

07:48.481 --> 07:54.869
I just need helptracking down a ukrainian
who might be in townlooking for me.

07:54.879 --> 07:56.519
Sounds likeyou're in a bind.

07:56.529 --> 07:58.278
Could be. That's whatI'm
trying to find out.

07:58.288 --> 07:59.518
Good luck.

07:59.528 --> 08:01.707
Not my problem.

08:05.296 --> 08:09.045
A while ago,one of your
shipmentsof p90s was "diverted."

08:09.055 --> 08:12.564
I can make surethat kind of thing stops.

08:12.574 --> 08:15.353
See,I don't like peoplein my business.

08:15.363 --> 08:18.512
This here friendship
hasgotten off to a bad start.

08:18.522 --> 08:20.532
Friendshipsare about give and take.

08:20.542 --> 08:23.961
You give methe information,I will
take careof your shipment issues.

08:23.971 --> 08:29.299
How about i give you one morechance to get
out of here before I shoot youin the face?

08:34.248 --> 08:36.116
That ukrainianI
mentioned --

08:36.126 --> 08:39.905
he brought a few extra
guysinto town with him.

08:40.206 --> 08:44.454
A flash-bang grenade temporarily
impairs hearing and vision.

08:44.474 --> 08:46.184
I'd get down.

08:50.213 --> 08:54.641
It makes fighting back or attempting
escape futile  and dangerous to civilians.

08:54.651 --> 08:59.290
So if you have to shoot blind,it's
better to use a camera than a gun.

09:04.398 --> 09:05.978
That was a short meeting.

09:06.778 --> 09:08.367
Michael?

09:10.977 --> 09:12.496
get him now!

09:20.164 --> 09:22.013
Michael!

09:22.313 --> 09:23.663
they were together

09:23.673 --> 09:25.512
take them both

09:41.827 --> 09:47.396
In a hostage situation,the same things
that get you killed  will extend your life.

09:47.406 --> 09:50.665
Hey,hey,hey,look,I don'tknow
who you guys are,okay?

09:50.685 --> 09:52.014
But I got no problemwith you,

09:52.054 --> 09:55.763
and I guarantee that youdon't want no problems
with me or the peoplethat I work with,huh?

09:55.773 --> 09:57.872
So let's just cut this
thing offright here.

09:57.882 --> 09:59.092
No harm,no foul.

09:59.102 --> 09:59.882
Everybody goes home.

09:59.892 --> 10:02.181
And we just --we just
forget all about it.

10:02.191 --> 10:04.820
If you have money,you'll
live till you pay.

10:04.830 --> 10:07.919
If you have information,you'll
live till you talk.

10:07.929 --> 10:09.939
Hey,come on! Look,you got the wrong guy!

10:09.949 --> 10:10.948
I'm not a part of this.

10:10.958 --> 10:13.798
I just met him for the
first timefive minutes ago.

10:13.808 --> 10:14.987
What do you thinkthey're gonna do?

10:14.997 --> 10:18.116
Drop you off at starbucks,give you
a couple of bucksfor a cup of coffee?

10:18.126 --> 10:20.126
Shut up. We'll figure it out.

10:20.166 --> 10:22.425
Come on. I'm serious,man!
You got the wrong guy!

10:22.435 --> 10:26.924
And if you have nothing,you're
pretty much disposable.

10:26.964 --> 10:29.313
the coward thinks...

10:29.343 --> 10:30.793
he can buy his life...

10:30.842 --> 10:32.592
by betraying me.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.271
we bring them both to chechik

10:34.311 --> 10:36.881
let him decide what he wants to do

10:46.408 --> 10:47.597
Excuse me.

10:47.607 --> 10:49.467
We need tokeep this area clear.

10:49.477 --> 10:55.145
Oh,well... you know,I was --I was in
here,and I-I ran outwhen those men showed up.

10:55.155 --> 10:57.924
And my husband
--he's still in here.

10:57.934 --> 11:00.254
Go ahead. Go ahead.

11:02.593 --> 11:03.293
Yeah,fi.

11:03.303 --> 11:05.882
Sam,I'm at the caf?
wheremichael was meeting beck.

11:05.892 --> 11:06.672
What's wrong?

11:06.682 --> 11:07.811
He's gone.

11:07.821 --> 11:09.401
So is beck.

11:09.411 --> 11:13.140
An extraction team --
professionals,from what I'm overhearing.

11:13.150 --> 11:15.889
Jesus. You think mikey'sukrainian
made his move already?

11:15.899 --> 11:19.068
Well,he moved quickerthan
anyone expected.

11:19.078 --> 11:21.147
Wait a second.

11:24.896 --> 11:27.096
Michael's cell.

11:29.575 --> 11:30.974
He took a picture of the team.

11:30.984 --> 11:33.314
You know what? We got to find strickler.

11:33.324 --> 11:35.103
Maybe he can put some
namesto these faces.

11:35.113 --> 11:36.213
I don't trust that guy.

11:36.223 --> 11:37.912
Yeah,well,he's all we got.

11:37.922 --> 11:39.952
Plus,it'll give us a
chanceto kick his teeth in.

11:39.962 --> 11:41.681
Well,I'm wearingmy teeth-kicking heels.

11:41.691 --> 11:43.061
See you in five.

11:43.071 --> 11:44.910
Is something wrong?

11:44.920 --> 11:47.150
Uh,no. Not at all.

11:47.160 --> 11:48.249
Why would you think that?

11:48.259 --> 11:50.668
So why you packing your
gunand your bulletproof vest?

11:50.678 --> 11:52.998
Look,it's nothing to worry
about. I justgot to run an errand.

11:53.008 --> 11:54.317
Really?

11:54.327 --> 11:56.757
So tell meabout this errand.

11:59.696 --> 12:01.195
are we close

12:01.235 --> 12:02.515
thirty minutes

12:02.525 --> 12:06.144
After the adrenaline rush of
an operation comes a crash.

12:06.154 --> 12:08.803
Heightened reflexes and
awareness don't last.

12:08.813 --> 12:14.261
Two boring hours of driving later,even the
sharpest killing machine  lets down his guard.

12:14.271 --> 12:17.360
You don't wantto meet this guy chechik.

12:19.620 --> 12:22.749
When it's time,get tothe
back door and open it.

12:22.759 --> 12:24.508
What are you doing?

12:25.988 --> 12:30.756
Just remember
--set your jaw.

12:32.646 --> 12:34.135
You traitor!
You son of a --

12:34.145 --> 12:37.214
are you thinking ofselling
me out to chechik?!

12:37.264 --> 12:39.184
I will kill you!

12:55.249 --> 12:56.509
You have to headinto the trees.

12:56.529 --> 12:59.498
Hey,I got nothingto do with this!

13:00.807 --> 13:02.577
I don't even know him!

13:02.587 --> 13:05.486
What do you want,an apology? Let's go!

13:06.736 --> 13:09.455
after them, now!

13:45.504 --> 13:47.793
Look,maddy,how many timesdo
we have to go over this?

13:47.803 --> 13:49.773
I mean,we're just doinga
little practice thing.

13:49.783 --> 13:51.572
Mike is fine,I swear.

13:51.582 --> 13:54.861
You're gonna hear some swearing
if you don'ttell me the truth.

13:54.891 --> 13:57.010
Sam,what istaking you so long?

13:57.020 --> 13:58.700
Oh,look! There's fiona.

13:58.710 --> 14:00.389
She never shows upwhen there's trouble.

14:00.399 --> 14:02.039
I'm telling you,there's no trouble.

14:02.049 --> 14:06.618
Fi's just hereto pick
me up for... a movie.

14:06.628 --> 14:08.357
Really?

14:08.367 --> 14:10.067
Well,I'm in the moodfor a matinee.

14:10.077 --> 14:12.176
Should I bring a gun,too?

14:13.056 --> 14:13.675
Madelyn
--

14:13.685 --> 14:15.625
don't you patronize me.

14:15.635 --> 14:18.454
I have a right to knowwhat's
happening with my son.

14:18.464 --> 14:23.163
Did I fall apart the last
timeyou told me what was going on?

14:23.173 --> 14:25.092
Someone took michael.

14:25.102 --> 14:26.212
They took him? Where?

14:26.222 --> 14:27.481
Well,that's whatwe need to find out.

14:27.491 --> 14:29.681
The secondyou find out
anything,I expect you to call me.

14:29.691 --> 14:30.640
Okay,maddy.

14:30.650 --> 14:34.509
Sam,let me remind you,you are
staying in myguest room,all right?

14:34.529 --> 14:38.248
You call me,or god as my witness,I
will smother youin your sleep.

14:38.258 --> 14:40.497
All right,all right. We'll call.

14:45.996 --> 14:47.145
Stop,stop,stop right now!

14:47.175 --> 14:48.605
Look,beck,we don'thave time for this.

14:48.615 --> 14:49.975
You want to shoot me?

14:49.985 --> 14:52.374
You'll have the same
problem,just with one less bullet.

14:52.384 --> 14:55.153
Yeah,well,maybe I'll dragyour ass
back to that road as a peace offering.

14:55.163 --> 14:56.792
I deal with russiansall the time.

14:56.802 --> 14:57.802
You speak the language?

14:57.812 --> 14:58.962
No.I got guys for that.

14:58.972 --> 15:00.201
Well,you better learn fast.

15:00.211 --> 15:01.841
Chechik didn't hiregoodwill ambassadors.

15:01.851 --> 15:04.990
They're not gonna waitfor a translator
to show up before they start shooting.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.229
So maybe I'll put a bullet in
your headin front of them,huh?

15:07.239 --> 15:08.979
That don't requirea lot of translation.

15:08.989 --> 15:11.308
Listen,beck,I got youinto
this. I will get you out.

15:11.318 --> 15:12.188
If we head
east --

15:12.198 --> 15:14.107
what? You want to
godeeper into the woods?!

15:14.117 --> 15:17.876
We got enough problems
without adding alligators to the list.

15:17.886 --> 15:19.526
You go whatever way you want.

15:19.536 --> 15:24.564
I'm going -- I'm -- I'm
--I'm going this way.

15:24.574 --> 15:27.453
Beck,save your ammo -- a few days
wandering around here starving,

15:27.463 --> 15:29.773
you're gonna want to
eat that last bullet.

15:32.832 --> 15:35.851
If you want to survive,beck,follow me.

15:59.784 --> 16:01.923
You missed a spot.

16:04.582 --> 16:05.842
Hello.

16:06.801 --> 16:08.191
You're michael's friends,right?

16:08.201 --> 16:09.071
Where is he?

16:09.081 --> 16:10.680
Want a mojito?

16:10.690 --> 16:12.940
Don't look so concerned,sweetheart.

16:13.489 --> 16:18.208
Let me guess -- our favorite spyis in a bit
of a jam,and you're hoping I can get him out.

16:18.808 --> 16:20.097
I wish it was that simple.

16:20.107 --> 16:23.886
I was the one telling him to keep his head down
till I could find out more about who was after him.

16:23.896 --> 16:24.906
And?

16:24.916 --> 16:26.216
I have some calls out.

16:26.226 --> 16:27.585
You've got some calls out?

16:27.595 --> 16:29.035
I suggest you try harder.

16:29.045 --> 16:30.514
No need for theatrics.

16:30.524 --> 16:32.784
I want michael aliveas
much as the next guy.

16:32.794 --> 16:35.293
Unless,of course,the
next guy's ukrainian.

16:35.333 --> 16:36.403
You know that fella?

16:36.413 --> 16:38.452
Michael took this
picturebefore he was snatched.

16:38.462 --> 16:40.581
Oh,yeah. I know that pretty boy.

16:40.591 --> 16:44.100
His name'svlad byrubin,balubin?

16:44.140 --> 16:45.810
Ugh,"b" something.

16:45.830 --> 16:49.439
Anyway,last time I checked,he's part of
a criminalsyndicate run by pyotr chechik.

16:49.449 --> 16:51.018
Chechik?

16:51.028 --> 16:52.548
That rings a bell.

16:52.558 --> 16:56.556
Mikey met him back in
'97when he blew up a --

16:56.586 --> 16:59.106
well,let's just saythat
he really hates mikey.

16:59.116 --> 17:00.585
Where can we find chechik?

17:00.595 --> 17:05.184
Huh,well,guyswith records like
him don't cross borderstoo easily.

17:05.194 --> 17:07.453
If he is in miami,he
didn't fly commercial.

17:07.463 --> 17:10.472
I know some of the pilots that
do themiami/eastern europe route.

17:10.482 --> 17:11.571
Could put out some feelers.

17:11.612 --> 17:13.601
Give me a couple of hours.

17:13.621 --> 17:15.471
I'm not giving youa couple minutes.

17:15.501 --> 17:17.750
I want names now.

17:24.127 --> 17:28.156
When on the run,subtle things like
broken branches,flattened grass,

17:28.166 --> 17:31.816
and disturbed ground  can give
you away to an expert tracker.

17:31.826 --> 17:36.215
An inexperienced tracker  may
require a more obvious trail.

17:36.225 --> 17:37.054
What is this?

17:37.064 --> 17:38.284
You trying to get us killed?

17:38.294 --> 17:42.493
No,followed -- we needto lead them deeper
in,turn their strengthsto weaknesses.

17:42.503 --> 17:44.772
Their bulletproof vestswill get
hotter,their guns will get heavy.

17:44.782 --> 17:46.401
We got to get them
fartherfrom their supplies.

17:46.411 --> 17:48.581
Whatever you got planned,okay,they're
far enough already.

17:48.591 --> 17:49.231
Beck,listen to me.

17:49.241 --> 17:50.230
No,you listen to me.

17:50.240 --> 17:51.800
I grew up in theflorida backwoods,man.

17:51.810 --> 17:53.749
I spent my whole lifetrying to get out.

17:53.759 --> 17:57.478
I fought my way down to miami so I'd never
have to swat bugsin another damn mangrove swamp,

17:57.488 --> 17:59.258
and now you justdragged me back.

17:59.268 --> 18:01.397
Man,I say we make our stand right here.

18:01.407 --> 18:02.377
You want to make a stand?

18:02.387 --> 18:03.796
Yes.

18:04.946 --> 18:07.425
Can we make the standover there?

18:07.435 --> 18:09.155
Okay.

18:24.350 --> 18:25.880
Still thinkyou can take them?

18:25.890 --> 18:27.179
There's five of them.

18:27.189 --> 18:28.259
I got five rounds.

18:28.269 --> 18:29.269
Oh,that's your plan?

18:29.279 --> 18:31.148
You have a 100% kill ratewith a handgun?

18:31.158 --> 18:33.267
Look,it's better than
runningaround in a damn swamp!

18:33.277 --> 18:34.527
I ain't too bad with a gun.

18:34.537 --> 18:35.907
I might teach you something.

18:35.917 --> 18:37.606
You fire,they'll get our position.

18:37.616 --> 18:40.005
They'll flank usand pin us down.

18:41.545 --> 18:43.494
We have to separate them.

18:44.044 --> 18:46.783
We got to lead themjust
a little farther in.

18:46.793 --> 18:48.023
And then we strike?

18:48.033 --> 18:50.102
And then we strike.

19:12.546 --> 19:15.515
Looks like the guy strickler
said flew chechikinto the country.

19:15.525 --> 19:18.004
Why anyone would allow him to
pilot a plane is beyond me.

19:18.014 --> 19:20.533
Oh,great.A drunk with a gun.

19:20.543 --> 19:22.403
This calls for subtlety.

19:22.413 --> 19:23.922
I can do subtle.

19:24.422 --> 19:26.201
I don't like to.

19:26.241 --> 19:28.091
But I can.

19:35.109 --> 19:39.517
What is a sweet,little girl like
you doing in a big,bad bar like this?

19:39.527 --> 19:44.226
I'm looking fora big,bad man... mm....

19:44.236 --> 19:45.966
Like you.

19:48.035 --> 19:52.094
Come with me or say goodbyeto
your two closest friends.

19:59.012 --> 20:01.181
We got a few hundred yards on them.

20:03.200 --> 20:04.640
Give me your shoelaces.

20:04.670 --> 20:06.779
Look,I may not be rambo,okay,but
ifyou're making a trap --

20:06.789 --> 20:08.229
it doesn't have to work.

20:08.239 --> 20:09.808
They'll see it. They'll
figure we're close.

20:09.818 --> 20:11.298
They'll fan out,and we'll
injure one of them.

20:11.308 --> 20:12.268
We're injuring them?

20:12.278 --> 20:13.647
It'll slow them down.

20:13.657 --> 20:17.586
If I have to drag a complaining pain in
the ass through the woods,they can,too.

20:17.596 --> 20:18.486
Now give meyour shoelaces.

20:18.496 --> 20:21.845
You know what --maybe it's time we
listen to the guy with a gunfor a while.

20:21.855 --> 20:23.084
Fine.

20:23.284 --> 20:26.873
Now give me your shoelaces.

20:42.798 --> 20:44.848
Mr.Smartass.

20:51.356 --> 20:52.855
All right. Let's try this again.

20:52.865 --> 20:56.534
Give me your shoelaces.Please.

21:03.812 --> 21:07.831
Hello.Yeah,maddy. You wanted
meto call,so I'm calling.

21:07.841 --> 21:09.031
Did you find michael?

21:09.041 --> 21:12.539
No,but we found some guy who might
be able to tell us where he is.

21:12.549 --> 21:14.299
Look,we're leaving hall and ale right now.

21:14.309 --> 21:17.018
We're heading over to the
loftto ask him some questions.

21:17.028 --> 21:18.468
You bring himhere instead.

21:18.478 --> 21:19.107
Madelyn.

21:19.117 --> 21:22.816
It's closerthan michael's loft,and
you don'thave time to waste.

21:56.366 --> 22:00.205
Fanning out in a search pattern  is
a great way to cover a lot of area,

22:00.245 --> 22:02.504
but it also divides your forces.

22:59.697 --> 23:00.727
Stand back!Stand back!

23:00.807 --> 23:03.126
Don'T.We need him alive,remember?

23:05.775 --> 23:10.184
You want to hit him again?***

23:22.820 --> 23:25.959
military units  are a
lot like marching bands.

23:28.209 --> 23:32.947
Take out the guy  conducting the operation,and
you'll throw everyone  out of sync.

23:33.367 --> 23:35.337
{\a6}the bastards wrecked my knee

23:34.947 --> 23:37.896
Pretty soon,all you have
left  is sound and fury.

23:42.004 --> 23:45.543
Hey,we got two
guns,explosives,a serious knife.

23:45.593 --> 23:47.233
We could even the oddsreal quick.

23:47.293 --> 23:49.702
Not until they call chechik.We
need to lure him out here.

23:49.882 --> 23:50.952
What are you talking about?

23:51.032 --> 23:53.231
If we get chechik,we can
end this.It's the only way.

23:53.321 --> 23:54.901
What,you wantmore men out here?

23:54.981 --> 23:57.810
When you started out,who wasthe
biggest hijacker in miami?

23:57.880 --> 23:59.489
Cuban guy
-- montez.

23:59.529 --> 24:01.529
How did youtake him down?

24:01.629 --> 24:04.708
Well,I paid one of his
guysto let me into his place,

24:04.748 --> 24:08.616
and then I stuck a gunin his mouth
until he decidedto move back to L.A.

24:08.706 --> 24:11.106
You dealt with the problemat the
top.That's whatwe're doing here.

24:11.176 --> 24:12.625
But what if they don't call chechik?

24:12.705 --> 24:14.625
They will.They're in over
their heads,and they know it.

24:21.363 --> 24:23.702
a*

24:23.882 --> 24:25.172
*

24:25.271 --> 24:27.021
See?

24:27.401 --> 24:29.230
Don't get cocky.

24:43.026 --> 24:46.845
You've been running upfrequent-flier
miles with a lotof shady characters.

24:46.965 --> 24:49.984
I wonder whatthe feds would think.

24:50.044 --> 24:52.333
I told you,man.All I
do is fly the plane.

24:53.183 --> 24:54.923
I doubt the boys in
suitswould see it that way.

24:55.023 --> 24:58.721
See,chechik is a bad guy.War
crimes,murder for hire.

24:58.771 --> 25:01.301
Why do you thinkI'm
keeping my mouth shut?

25:11.817 --> 25:14.557
That guy is more afraidof
chechik than he is of us.

25:14.607 --> 25:15.956
We're gonna have tosqueeze him harder.

25:15.986 --> 25:17.756
If by "squeeze"you
mean "choke" --

25:17.816 --> 25:19.405
he can't talkif he can't breathe,fi.

25:19.475 --> 25:20.905
He can whisper.I have good hearing.

25:20.975 --> 25:22.834
You push him too
hard,he's gonna snap,okay?

25:22.914 --> 25:24.904
And then he's just
gonnastart making crap up.

25:25.014 --> 25:27.553
Sam axe wisdom.

25:35.320 --> 25:37.830
How you doing?

25:38.000 --> 25:40.559
You comfortable?You need anything?

25:41.619 --> 25:43.328
Mind if I sit?

25:44.528 --> 25:46.677
You want a cigarette?

25:47.007 --> 25:49.196
Mind if I do?

25:54.285 --> 25:56.854
Sorry.I don'tmean to bother you.It's
just I needa little peace and quiet.

25:56.914 --> 25:59.493
They get loudwhen they're angry.

26:09.020 --> 26:11.490
Luckily,this placeis well-insulated.

26:11.769 --> 26:14.529
You can't even hear a peepfrom outside.

26:15.208 --> 26:18.108
Probably whythey like it so much.

26:21.966 --> 26:24.726
I'm sorry.I hope I didn'tgive
you the wrong impression.

26:24.796 --> 26:29.264
I have never once,ever,everseen
them make anyone suffer.

26:31.234 --> 26:34.773
If they don't thinkyou'll
break,they end it quick.

26:35.652 --> 26:38.291
You sure you don'twant a cigarette?

26:38.391 --> 26:40.481
It's good for the nerves.

26:40.551 --> 26:43.740
It's not like you have to
worryabout getting cancer anymore.

26:47.269 --> 26:49.638
Ooh,I'm sorry.Did I hurt you?

26:51.607 --> 26:53.627
There you go.

27:04.764 --> 27:06.773
Good,huh?

27:09.062 --> 27:11.621
- I don't micromanage you.
- I'm not micromanaging you,either.

27:11.671 --> 27:15.280
He dropped them off by seaplanea few hours
ago -- a small cabin in the middleof the swamp.

27:15.320 --> 27:18.239
There's no address,but I
gotthe latitude and longitude.

27:19.369 --> 27:20.699
How?

27:20.779 --> 27:22.388
Oh,honey,I've met guyslike this before.

27:22.448 --> 27:25.327
They're only bravewhen
people are yelling at them.

27:26.547 --> 27:30.046
So you gonna go get my son,or
do I have to do that,too?!

27:41.402 --> 27:46.151
When fighting in the wilderness,the biggest
threats are often the ones you don't see --

27:46.241 --> 27:47.931
dehydration...

27:50.220 --> 27:53.089
...exhaustion,and nerves.

27:55.848 --> 27:59.707
But boatloads of hostiles
don't help,either.

28:01.326 --> 28:03.526
- There's chechik.
- Damn!

28:03.916 --> 28:05.855
Is there a russian wordfor "hard-ass"?

28:05.975 --> 28:08.674
***

28:21.450 --> 28:25.069
If we can get him into the woods,we'll have
enough cover to separate him from his men.

28:25.159 --> 28:28.658
You sound pretty confident for a guy hiding
in a jungle with a pair of designer slacks.

28:28.698 --> 28:30.958
We wanted chechik.There he is.

28:31.028 --> 28:33.717
Yeah,along with more
men,moreguns,and damn airboats,man!

28:33.797 --> 28:36.796
We take out chechik,and
allthose guys will come after us.

28:36.876 --> 28:39.385
The men who work for you -- if you
were taken out,what would they do?

28:39.455 --> 28:41.045
Shoot the bastards who did it.

28:41.115 --> 28:43.434
Really?You really think so?

28:43.494 --> 28:46.493
You saidyou had no friends.All
right,think like a businessman.

28:46.593 --> 28:51.062
How long would they stomparound in this swamp once
the guy who cuts their checks is out of commission?

29:06.397 --> 29:07.667
Hey,how you doing?

29:07.737 --> 29:09.216
Yeah,how you doing?

29:09.256 --> 29:11.795
Hey,what'll it take to rent one
of these babiesfor a couple hours?

29:11.845 --> 29:15.074
90 bucks,plus insurance.

29:15.144 --> 29:18.423
$25 for basic coverage,$15
for supplemental liability.

29:18.493 --> 29:20.413
Does that cover small-arms fire?

29:20.593 --> 29:26.001
Uh,what my friend here is saying
is,uh,we're not big on paperwork.

29:28.670 --> 29:31.529
50 extra bucks,you
guys weren't even here.

29:31.869 --> 29:34.149
Look.We just disappeared.

29:34.898 --> 29:36.998
Thank you,sir.

30:06.009 --> 30:08.318
So,we get him when he
goes into the woods,huh?

30:08.428 --> 30:10.148
Only he ain't going into the woods.

30:10.278 --> 30:11.657
We have to get him to
move.The point is --

30:11.667 --> 30:13.747
the point is that you
wanted them to call for backup.

30:13.787 --> 30:16.526
And they did,okay,and now we're
out numbered five to one.

30:16.576 --> 30:20.705
In battle,not even the best-laid
plans survive contact with the enemy.

30:20.755 --> 30:24.263
If you want to survive,you
have to be willing to improvise.

30:24.313 --> 30:26.913
- All right,if you distract
his men -- wait,wait,wait!

30:26.993 --> 30:28.942
Distract a dozen guys with guns?

30:29.022 --> 30:30.302
Forget it!You and me are done!

30:30.362 --> 30:32.611
I'd rather take my chanceswith
mr.Hard-ass over there.

30:32.651 --> 30:34.450
Beck,stop.Beck!

30:35.540 --> 30:36.790
You're gonnaget yourself killed.

30:36.850 --> 30:38.349
So,what you gonna do,shoot me,huh?

30:38.399 --> 30:39.559
Give away your position?

30:39.659 --> 30:43.058
Of course,there's such a thing
as too much improvisation.

30:43.118 --> 30:45.097
Hey,it's like you
said.I'm a businessman.

30:45.147 --> 30:47.437
I got something they want.Now
it's time to negotiate.

30:48.396 --> 30:50.206
I want to make a deal!

30:50.356 --> 30:52.405
You want westen,I can give you westen!

31:51.267 --> 31:52.937
Guess I have to.

32:10.651 --> 32:12.051
They went in the river.

32:13.940 --> 32:15.840
**

32:36.854 --> 32:39.703
You know,I should have shot you
when you first interruptedmy coffee.

32:39.753 --> 32:42.272
Let's not dwellon missed opportunities.

32:44.461 --> 32:48.080
You know,I got 25 peopleon my payroll.

32:48.490 --> 32:53.189
I got -- I got peoplewho report
to people who report to people.

32:53.429 --> 32:56.868
And here I am,alonein the middle of
nowhere,about to diefrom a damn leg wound!

32:56.918 --> 32:58.287
Well,you're not alone.

32:59.997 --> 33:02.686
The hell I'm not.What,you gonna
stick aroundand watch me die?

33:02.766 --> 33:04.245
No.We're gonna getthrough this together.

33:04.345 --> 33:05.765
What?What are you,crazy?

33:05.835 --> 33:08.014
You've seen what happens
topeople with leg wounds out here.

33:08.104 --> 33:10.354
Look,it doesn'thave to be that way.

33:10.384 --> 33:12.013
But you have todecide right now.

33:12.043 --> 33:15.922
Are you ready to trust meand figure out a
plan,or do you wantto die out here alone?

33:18.021 --> 33:20.351
Is it really that tough of a call?

33:24.759 --> 33:30.048
Delaying tactics aren't the most glamorous part  of
a battle plan,but they're often the most important.

33:30.128 --> 33:34.046
Slowing the enemy down  buys you time
to prepare the ground ahead of you,

33:34.166 --> 33:38.555
and that,more than almost
anything else,wins battles.

33:38.645 --> 33:40.285
Where is your friend?

33:40.384 --> 33:42.254
I got nothingto say to you.

33:44.493 --> 33:46.383
Where is michael?

33:46.463 --> 33:48.932
Why should I tell you?You'rejust
gonna kill me anyway!

33:50.052 --> 33:52.351
Maybe.Maybe not.

33:52.471 --> 33:55.490
You're nobody.I'm here for westen.

33:56.310 --> 34:01.898
You tell me where he is,and I'll give
you some waterand bandages for the wound.

34:07.226 --> 34:08.656
You see this?

34:08.726 --> 34:12.495
I swear on the cross,on
the eyes of my children.

34:13.654 --> 34:16.274
All right.Fine.

34:16.344 --> 34:21.172
He went that way.There's a
swamp wherethe airboats can't go.

34:47.904 --> 34:50.583

hope you brought bug spray.

35:10.008 --> 35:11.797
That must bechechik's airboat.

35:11.887 --> 35:13.666
They got to be close.

35:19.095 --> 35:21.944
For a spy,there's no shame in retreat.

35:21.994 --> 35:26.852
When faced with a more powerful enemy,you're
trained to get out of the way and keep moving.

35:26.902 --> 35:28.942
It's not about running
away or giving up.

35:28.992 --> 35:34.600
The goal of any retreat is to find the right
place  to marshal your resources and make a stand.

35:43.677 --> 35:48.706
Military history is filled  with stories
of small forces taking on larger ones.

35:48.796 --> 35:52.525
Whether it's david fighting goliath  or
the french resistance fighting the nazis,

35:52.585 --> 35:56.614
the strategy is basically the same --
you have to choose the right ground,

35:56.703 --> 35:58.663
deploy your resources carefully,

35:58.713 --> 36:02.742
and remember that the greatest
weapon in any battle  is surprise.

36:08.830 --> 36:11.059
Give me the radio.

36:13.169 --> 36:14.488
Well,well,michael.

36:14.658 --> 36:20.526
Here we are again,after so many
years -- you,me,plenty of guns.

36:20.776 --> 36:23.246
I almost forgot how
much I enjoyed the hunt.

36:23.295 --> 36:28.014
You know,I thought after serving 10 years for
war crimes you would have found a new hobby.

36:28.094 --> 36:30.983
Oh,10 years just made
me want to find you more.

36:31.053 --> 36:33.612
Never get over the one that got away.

36:33.712 --> 36:35.172
Well,I'm flattered.

36:35.232 --> 36:37.561
You brought a whole army just
to find little old me?

36:37.621 --> 36:39.351
Times change, michael.

36:39.411 --> 36:42.010
An army that big,I
got to fold my laundry.

36:42.090 --> 36:43.779
I work for fedor markov now.

36:43.859 --> 36:48.888
Markov?You know,I liked you kgb
officers better before you sold out.

36:48.938 --> 36:50.907
You know,at least you
believed in something.

36:50.977 --> 36:53.107
You should be happy,michael.

36:53.167 --> 36:56.945
We all live american dream,dream
spies like you helped make.

36:56.995 --> 36:59.844
Open borders,free
markets.Everyone's friends.

37:00.024 --> 37:05.033
Look at me --ukrainian with russian
team,german weapons,funding from the west.

37:05.073 --> 37:10.221
So many backgrounds,so many people working together
just to drag every secret out of michael westen's

37:10.291 --> 37:13.380
head before we cut it
off and feed it to the dogs.

37:13.450 --> 37:14.740
But enough talk.

37:14.820 --> 37:17.949
As much as I'd like to catch up,you
should have turned your radio off.

Get your men to drop their
guns,or you're a dead man.

37:52.289 --> 37:53.738
Chechik:All right,all right.

37:53.888 --> 37:56.148
Guns down now.

38:06.285 --> 38:08.304

to worry about any more.

38:10.893 --> 38:12.343
Get up.

38:14.312 --> 38:16.771
- Thanks,man.-
Easy-peasy,huh?

38:24.809 --> 38:26.768
I expect some serious memory
loss.You understand?

38:26.798 --> 38:28.758
Yeah,yeah.

38:28.938 --> 38:30.157
You think this is over?

38:30.277 --> 38:33.736
Shevchenkos look outfor their
own.Markov will find you.

38:33.806 --> 38:35.676
Don't you know it's rude to drop names?

38:35.756 --> 38:37.065
Beck:Yeah,stupid,too.

38:37.135 --> 38:40.504
Especially when a "nobody"like
me can drop bigger ones.

38:40.544 --> 38:42.704
All those kgb colonels in
the russian mafia?

38:42.754 --> 38:47.612
Well,they work for an old kgb general who
happens to be a business associate of mine.

38:47.732 --> 38:52.781
Now,I don't want to name names,but he can
controlsabout 800 miles of the siberian oil pipeline.

38:53.010 --> 38:54.950
Yeah.

38:55.230 --> 38:57.769
Yeah,I do alltheir import/export work.

38:57.819 --> 39:00.048
You nearly cost them a
lot of money today.

39:00.158 --> 39:03.377
I'm gonna have togive them a
call,see how they feel about that.

39:03.427 --> 39:06.216
I give you $50,000,and I
swear you'll never see me again.

39:06.296 --> 39:08.706
I know i won'T.Get this fool out of here.

39:08.736 --> 39:10.065
Stop.$100,000.

39:10.165 --> 39:12.285
Don't be stupid! Come on!

39:12.355 --> 39:14.324
There's not enough money in the world.

39:16.273 --> 39:20.722
Mikey,next time you get kidnapped,can
you stay out of the everglades?

39:20.822 --> 39:23.971
There ain't gonna be no next
time,at least not for these boys.

39:24.571 --> 39:27.460
And you still owe me a shipment
of p90s.Don't think I forgot.

39:27.520 --> 39:29.649
I'll make sure they get to you.

39:29.679 --> 39:32.828
You know,one day,I think we're gonna look
back on this as a nice day out in nature.

39:32.888 --> 39:34.878
Yeah,don't push it.

39:35.078 --> 39:37.207
I'll just say this.

39:37.247 --> 39:39.996
You said you were a good friend to have.

39:40.436 --> 39:42.815
Could do worse.

39:47.614 --> 39:51.033
So... what brings you two out
to this neck of the woods?

39:51.153 --> 39:53.952
Oh,well,you know,it's such a sunny day.

39:54.062 --> 39:56.451
I thought you might need these.

40:08.198 --> 40:12.247
I'm beginning to think I should
get you one of those harness things.

40:12.327 --> 40:14.356
You know,like they have for toddlers.

40:14.436 --> 40:17.085
You've been wandering off a
little too much these days.

40:17.505 --> 40:20.104
It's nothing I can't handle,mom.

40:20.204 --> 40:26.472
No,see,you don't get to act that casual when I'm
interrogating strange men in my garage to save your life.

40:28.332 --> 40:30.161
I'm sorry about that,mom.

40:30.201 --> 40:31.681
Whatever.

40:31.741 --> 40:35.240
Getting answers out of him was a hell of
a lot easier than getting them out of you.

40:37.599 --> 40:39.248
Be careful.

40:40.258 --> 40:42.068
Okay?

40:45.996 --> 40:49.096
So,do you likemy new curtains?

40:50.105 --> 40:51.995
You hung your curtainsby yourself?

40:52.075 --> 40:54.844
Actually,no.Some very
nice people came over and did it.

40:54.884 --> 40:57.603
They were sent overby
your friend strickler.

40:57.753 --> 40:59.232
Wonderful.

40:59.292 --> 41:02.781
Try not to wrinkle them
when you're sweeping them for bugs.

41:16.797 --> 41:18.467
No gift basket?

41:18.507 --> 41:21.866
Michael,so niceto have you back in town.

41:21.956 --> 41:24.475
Uh,no,no gift basket.I
got you something better --

41:24.795 --> 41:27.224
your share of the ukrainian deal.

41:27.294 --> 41:31.313
Turns out a group of baltic separatists wanted
chechik out of the picture just as much as you did.

41:31.403 --> 41:33.942
Some quick negotiating on
my part,and,voil?

41:33.992 --> 41:36.141
your day-trip to the
swamp paid for itself.

41:36.201 --> 41:38.241
I didn't fight off chechik for the cash.

41:38.281 --> 41:40.180
I know.You did it for you.

41:40.210 --> 41:42.599
This is justa wonderful by-product.

41:42.659 --> 41:45.129
And this is just the beginning.I can
get you whatever you want,michael.

41:45.179 --> 41:47.968
Let me save you some time,strickler.I'm
never gonna work with you.

41:48.018 --> 41:51.457
Not for the money,not for the
yogurt,for the curtains.

41:51.527 --> 41:53.046
I'm not a mercenary.

41:53.106 --> 41:55.016
Okay.

41:55.086 --> 41:57.985
But,michael,you got toask yourself
this.What is it that you want?

41:58.045 --> 41:59.394
What is it that you deserve?

41:59.434 --> 42:03.893
A man with your skills,with your
background,burned,out in the cold,with nothing?

42:04.313 --> 42:07.542
Don't answer right
now.Just think about it.

42:10.641 --> 42:12.101
I'll be around.
