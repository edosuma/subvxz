[woman vocalizing]

03:55.903 --> 03:58.003
[vocalizing ends]

04:00.274 --> 04:02.541
[supreme leader]
You may think you know me,

04:02.543 --> 04:04.076
you don't.

04:04.078 --> 04:06.778
You think you
understand my cause,

04:06.780 --> 04:09.114
you don't.

04:09.116 --> 04:11.617
Does this image of me
make you think?

04:11.619 --> 04:13.952
Does it make you feel something?

04:13.954 --> 04:17.956
Think of your life,
your friends, your family.

04:17.958 --> 04:22.194
Can you see them, are they
crystal-clear in your mind?

04:24.231 --> 04:26.965
Now, set that image on fire,

04:26.967 --> 04:30.902
the image of everything you know
surrounded by flames.

04:30.904 --> 04:33.805
Your world despises us,

04:33.807 --> 04:37.042
robs our lands
with the promise of freedom.

04:37.044 --> 04:40.479
Your freedom enslaves
our beliefs in the lockbox

04:40.481 --> 04:43.749
of forever Western ideals.

04:43.751 --> 04:46.385
You lied to my people.

04:46.387 --> 04:48.920
You choke on the promises
of tomorrow.

04:48.922 --> 04:53.158
The image of my family,
my culture and beliefs

04:53.160 --> 04:56.295
ripped away and replaced
with an establishment

04:56.297 --> 04:59.564
that we did not elect
or agree to.

04:59.566 --> 05:02.167
That is my freedom.

05:02.169 --> 05:05.404
The freedom to be enslaved.

05:05.406 --> 05:09.875
Your Western world tells
my people to "suck it up".

05:10.644 --> 05:13.445
But this mission is for you.

05:13.447 --> 05:15.580
We are supposed
to sit back and watch

05:15.582 --> 05:18.650
as you run wild
across our lands.

05:18.652 --> 05:20.252
For what?

05:20.254 --> 05:22.120
A better life?

05:22.122 --> 05:24.222
A better cause?

05:25.192 --> 05:28.026
Is this a better cause?

05:28.028 --> 05:31.663
You live your happy lives
a million miles away,

05:31.665 --> 05:34.166
while my people live caged
in your zoo,

05:34.168 --> 05:36.702
on display for all to see.

05:38.205 --> 05:41.707
You walk past our cages
thinking nothing of us

05:41.709 --> 05:44.042
or your failed ideas.

05:44.044 --> 05:50.315
For 16 years, you have held my
country and my people hostage.

05:50.317 --> 05:54.886
The world will say
I am a monster.

05:54.888 --> 05:57.823
I'm the monster
of the perfect design

05:57.825 --> 06:00.359
because your government
created me.

06:01.228 --> 06:03.228
Take a good look.

06:03.230 --> 06:07.499
This war is far beyond
the sands of my homeland.

06:07.501 --> 06:09.401
This war is global.

06:09.403 --> 06:12.104
These lands around me
are ruled with no laws...

06:13.307 --> 06:16.808
no justice, no feelings
or remorse.

06:16.810 --> 06:20.746
If you are still wondering
what pushes my motive,

06:20.748 --> 06:25.584
what makes my cause
more than just an idea?

06:25.586 --> 06:28.286
Ask yourself one question.

06:30.357 --> 06:33.859
Can you still see that image
of your life in your mind?

06:33.861 --> 06:36.328
Have you applied what I said?

06:37.731 --> 06:40.665
Have the flames burned
that image to ashes...

06:41.769 --> 06:45.370
ashes blowing away in the winds
of distant memory

06:45.372 --> 06:48.240
of what was once our lives.

06:49.910 --> 06:53.578
Those memories are the same
in my mind.

06:53.580 --> 06:57.682
They are images of what we
used to know and understand.

06:59.887 --> 07:02.754
Does that still make
me the monster...

07:04.792 --> 07:07.492
or does it make me
the hero?

07:25.746 --> 07:27.946
Watch this.

07:56.343 --> 07:58.877
[vocalizing]

08:13.760 --> 08:15.427
[screaming]

08:19.333 --> 08:21.733
[gunfire]

08:31.645 --> 08:33.245
Get them!

08:43.690 --> 08:45.390
[speaking Arabic]

08:58.972 --> 09:00.705
They're right in there!

09:03.210 --> 09:05.043

[speaking Arabic]

09:40.781 --> 09:43.315
[yelling in Arabic]

10:04.137 --> 10:05.870
No, please, leave them alone!

10:05.872 --> 10:07.305
[shouts, indistinct]

10:10.077 --> 10:11.309
[speaking Arabic]

10:26.393 --> 10:28.226
[in English]
Do you know who I am?

10:31.131 --> 10:32.597
Good.

10:32.599 --> 10:34.332
We have nothing.

10:35.902 --> 10:39.037
We are...
We are a peaceful village.

10:39.840 --> 10:41.606
Please.

10:41.608 --> 10:43.008
I'm begging you.

10:43.010 --> 10:44.309
Let us go.

10:44.945 --> 10:46.211
Peaceful?

10:48.248 --> 10:49.814
You know why I'm here?

10:51.485 --> 10:54.185
We're in this fight together,
do you understand?

10:54.855 --> 10:56.721
We are not soldiers.

10:59.960 --> 11:01.993
We are innocent.

11:01.995 --> 11:04.929
No one is innocent.
Even your son.

11:04.931 --> 11:08.833
He must fight for us.
Otherwise, he is my enemy.

11:08.835 --> 11:10.602
We're not your enemy.

11:11.605 --> 11:13.538
This is not our fight.

11:13.540 --> 11:16.775
Not your fight?
Look around you.

11:16.777 --> 11:18.943
They have
destroyed everything.

11:18.945 --> 11:21.279
Do you think they
will not do this to you?

11:21.281 --> 11:23.548
Lambs waiting to be slaughtered.

11:23.550 --> 11:27.018
The war is raging, lines in
the sand have been drawn.

11:31.224 --> 11:34.526
You're either with me
or against me.

11:35.796 --> 11:37.696
Make your choice.

11:38.832 --> 11:41.099
Please, please.

11:41.868 --> 11:43.535
[speaks Arabic]

11:43.537 --> 11:47.839
No! No, no, not my son! No!

11:51.044 --> 11:52.644
Oh, no.

11:52.646 --> 11:56.915
Don't you understand?
This is war!

11:58.318 --> 11:59.918
I will not ask you again!

12:25.112 --> 12:26.377
No!

12:26.379 --> 12:27.912
[speaking Arabic]

12:27.914 --> 12:33.384
No! Oh, no.
Please, please, please!

12:33.386 --> 12:36.087
If there must be bloodshed
for you, well, take my life!

12:36.089 --> 12:39.724
But please don't--
don't take-- don't take hers.

12:39.726 --> 12:43.528
Run! Run! Please!

Do you need anything else, sir?

15:29.863 --> 15:32.130
I need this transcribed.

15:34.935 --> 15:36.935
Get it over
to the Pentagon ASAP.

15:36.937 --> 15:38.803
Absolutely.

15:56.323 --> 15:57.655
Welcome, sir.
Thank you.

15:57.657 --> 15:59.090
How are we looking?

15:59.092 --> 16:00.959
Good, sir. The team is
waiting for you.

16:00.961 --> 16:02.427
Excellent.

16:02.429 --> 16:04.829
If you follow me, I have
your war room set up.

16:06.599 --> 16:07.966
Lead the way.

16:18.178 --> 16:20.378
Marino.
Sir.

16:23.149 --> 16:26.184
[sighs] Cozy.

16:26.186 --> 16:27.785
We've access
to satellites.

16:27.787 --> 16:30.154
Comm links for mission, armory,
everything you need.

16:31.157 --> 16:33.558
The file you requested.

16:35.128 --> 16:37.562
Team?
I'll get them now.

16:55.015 --> 16:58.383
No need for formalities,
as you were.

17:00.320 --> 17:02.720
You've all met, so we
can skip introductions.

17:03.723 --> 17:05.556
Your respective countries
have deemed you

17:05.558 --> 17:07.625
the best at what you do.

17:07.627 --> 17:11.295
What I'm going to ask you to do
will test you on every level.

17:11.297 --> 17:13.564
These missions
are off the record.

17:13.566 --> 17:15.333
No one outside this room
will know who you are,

17:15.335 --> 17:16.733
or what we're about to do.

17:16.736 --> 17:19.303
Sever any ties back home,
at least for now.

17:19.305 --> 17:22.173
Our enemies are unique.

17:22.175 --> 17:24.642
Intel from the CIA
and our European allies

17:24.644 --> 17:28.846
have pinpointed Muhammad Aabib
as our first person of interest.

17:28.848 --> 17:30.648
He's an arms dealer
to terrorist groups

17:30.650 --> 17:34.085
throughout the Middle East
and has ties to the Black Masks.

17:34.087 --> 17:35.820
Black Masks?

17:35.822 --> 17:38.723
A bad group with ruthless
intentions, leadership unknown.

17:38.725 --> 17:41.993
That's what makes Aabib
a key asset.

17:41.995 --> 17:45.063
Small town north of here
is his last known location.

17:45.065 --> 17:47.532
We believe he's still there.

17:47.534 --> 17:49.267
This our first mission.

17:49.269 --> 17:52.570
Due to the urgency
and current Intel,

17:52.572 --> 17:55.506
we'll forego any bonding
and training exercises.

17:55.508 --> 17:59.077
Get along and do your jobs.

18:19.966 --> 18:21.866
Yeah, no rules.

18:23.536 --> 18:25.403
Hey, everything we do
has an impact.

18:25.405 --> 18:26.604
Let's find these guys.

18:26.606 --> 18:28.606
Let's just get
one thing straight.

18:28.608 --> 18:32.543
Keep your weapons up
and stay out of my way.

not just your seal sisters.

18:38.952 --> 18:40.718
Let it go, brother.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.887
Yeah, James, let it go.

18:42.889 --> 18:44.722
Listen to locks of love.

18:44.724 --> 18:46.157
Why don't you chill out, Ralph?

18:46.159 --> 18:48.392
We've been here all of
five minutes, all right?

18:50.096 --> 18:51.462
James.

19:07.981 --> 19:10.214
Knives your thing?

19:12.585 --> 19:14.385
Cool, cool, cool.

19:18.324 --> 19:19.991
People.

19:19.993 --> 19:21.425
Sir.

19:24.197 --> 19:25.897
It's time.

19:28.501 --> 19:31.502
It's like the first day
of school. We got this.

Hey, keep your eyes peeled.

20:03.536 --> 20:07.371
We don't know what we're
walking into. On me, guys.

20:07.373 --> 20:10.374
No, on me.

20:10.376 --> 20:12.510
Is this how
it's going to be?

20:12.512 --> 20:14.512
Just keep moving, Chris.

20:14.514 --> 20:16.414
Copy that.

20:40.240 --> 20:41.339
One POI.

20:44.244 --> 20:45.576
I got this, mate.

20:45.578 --> 20:47.578

20:47.580 --> 20:49.447
Oy, I was on my vacation.

20:49.449 --> 20:52.183
Now I'm in the middle of
the desert with you lot.

20:54.420 --> 20:56.053
Go, team.

21:34.127 --> 21:36.193
Welcome to the party, mate.

21:40.733 --> 21:42.933
POI means person of interest.

21:42.935 --> 21:44.502
That man was clearly
surrendering.

He could have had intel.

25:25.057 --> 25:27.892
Good work. Bring him home.

25:30.196 --> 25:32.062
Fucking American assholes!

25:32.064 --> 25:33.697
American? What the fuck?

25:35.635 --> 25:37.535
[yelling indistinct]
Trust me!

25:38.905 --> 25:40.804
I'm fucking French!

25:43.743 --> 25:45.743
Galina, let's go.
We gotta move!

25:45.745 --> 25:48.379
[gasps] Twenty seconds.
There's shit everywhere!

25:48.381 --> 25:50.214
Come on,
we're running out of time!

25:57.089 --> 25:59.223
Fuck! Med pack, James.
Move, move!

25:59.225 --> 26:01.992
Med pack, med pack!
Man down, man down!

26:02.495 --> 26:03.761
Man down.

26:03.763 --> 26:05.362
Goddamn it,
get that headset back on!

26:05.364 --> 26:06.931
I need a new evac route.

26:06.933 --> 26:09.733
Let's go! Move, move!
Come on, James!

26:09.735 --> 26:13.070
Fuck! Lay down.
Yo, pull it out, pull it out!

26:13.072 --> 26:14.538
Chris, Chris, Chris.
Look at me.

26:14.540 --> 26:16.340
Fuck! Come on, Chris.
Look at me. Look at me.

26:16.342 --> 26:19.543
Oh fuck, he's fucking-- Aah!
Give me that fucking gun!

26:19.545 --> 26:21.679
Chris, Chris, Chris!
[Ralph] Commander Brisco!

26:21.681 --> 26:23.681
Stay with me, okay?
I'm gonna get you out of here.

26:23.683 --> 26:25.883
Fuck. Give me one more, more!
You guys gotta go!

26:25.885 --> 26:28.018
Galina, cut the fucking cord!

26:29.288 --> 26:31.622
Galina, cut the cord!
Come on. Eyes open, eyes open!

26:31.624 --> 26:33.891
Pull, pull!

26:33.893 --> 26:35.626
Shit. [grunts]

26:35.628 --> 26:37.094
Go, go, go!

26:40.132 --> 26:41.699
[gunfire]
We're coming in hot!

26:46.739 --> 26:49.306
Jesus Christ, the whole town's
alive. Where's that evac route?

26:52.278 --> 26:53.877
New evac map on screen.

26:56.048 --> 26:58.916
Daniel, move south. Fifty yards
ahead, there's an alley.

26:58.918 --> 27:00.684
Go right.
That's the exit out of town.

27:04.957 --> 27:06.490
What the fuck is going on?

27:06.492 --> 27:08.459
Weapons free,
weapons free!

27:08.461 --> 27:10.494
Enemy... There!
[gunfire]

27:11.330 --> 27:13.330
Move, move, move!
I cover you guys!

27:17.937 --> 27:20.137
Move! Move!
Let's go! Let's move!

27:20.139 --> 27:21.338
We've reached the alley!

27:21.340 --> 27:22.673
[Brisco on radio]
<i>Keep moving!</i>

27:22.675 --> 27:24.408
Exit clear!

27:24.410 --> 27:26.710
James, come on.
I need your help.

27:29.348 --> 27:31.248
We're losing him.

27:31.250 --> 27:33.017
Fuck! Ah, fuck.

27:33.019 --> 27:35.085
Chris, Chris, Chris.
Stay with me.

27:35.087 --> 27:36.253
Stay with me.

27:37.289 --> 27:38.922
There's more coming!

27:43.596 --> 27:44.828
[man shouting in Arabic]

27:44.830 --> 27:47.698
Come on, come on.
[shouts]

27:53.673 --> 27:55.839
[bullets ricocheting]

27:58.711 --> 28:00.077
I can slow them down!

28:01.180 --> 28:02.279
Come on!

28:04.483 --> 28:06.517
Grenade out! Take cover!

28:12.191 --> 28:14.391
Chris, Chris, look at me.
Stay with me. Hey, hey, hey.

28:14.393 --> 28:17.961
It's gonna be all right.
No, no. Hey, hey, hey!

28:17.963 --> 28:21.331
We're gonna get you home,
okay? Bandages!

28:21.333 --> 28:22.966
[indistinct yelling]

28:27.540 --> 28:29.306
We're not out of this yet!

28:29.308 --> 28:31.108
Hold the line!

28:32.745 --> 28:34.411
Stay with me. Stay with me.

28:34.413 --> 28:35.846
Xu, Xu, adrenaline shot.

28:35.848 --> 28:37.848
Adrenaline shot.
Let's go, let's go. Come on.

28:37.850 --> 28:40.017
Chris, Chris, look at me.
Stay with me.

28:40.019 --> 28:43.353
Let's go. Let's go. Hey, what
the fuck you doing? Come on!

28:43.355 --> 28:44.888
Hey, Chris, stay with me.

28:47.827 --> 28:49.593
He's losing a lot of blood!

28:51.230 --> 28:52.663
Status?

28:52.665 --> 28:54.231
I count half a dozen
moving down the street.

28:56.869 --> 28:58.268
Come on, come on.

29:08.514 --> 29:10.013
What's your count?

29:13.285 --> 29:15.219
Six, maybe more!

29:15.221 --> 29:18.355
We have to find a way out!
Xu, we need you up here with us!

29:18.357 --> 29:19.623
On it!

29:28.400 --> 29:32.636
Okay, okay.
All right, here we go.

29:32.638 --> 29:34.471
Okay, we're gonna get you home.

29:37.042 --> 29:39.109
No, no, no, no, no.

29:53.425 --> 29:54.892
Mag reload!

30:08.607 --> 30:10.140
Clear!

30:11.243 --> 30:13.076
We're losing track.
Come on, move back!

30:13.078 --> 30:14.444
Let's go!
Let's go.

30:14.446 --> 30:16.513
How is he?

30:19.018 --> 30:20.851
He's gone.

30:25.791 --> 30:27.658
Let's get him home.

30:34.600 --> 30:36.166
He's gone.

30:43.943 --> 30:45.776
[pilot over radio]
<i>On final, right face.</i>

30:45.778 --> 30:49.446
[radio tech] <i> Bear right,</i>
<i>clear left, clear to land.</i>

30:49.448 --> 30:51.782
[pilot]
<i>We have one KIA.</i>

30:59.792 --> 31:01.959
[grunts]

31:01.961 --> 31:05.896
I know today was hard.
You all did your jobs.

31:05.898 --> 31:08.498
We have to keep moving forward.

31:08.500 --> 31:10.234
Detail to secure Chris' body.

31:10.236 --> 31:12.369
Yes, sir. We're on it.

31:12.371 --> 31:13.570
What did you find?

31:13.572 --> 31:16.073
I have a pack
full of intel.

31:16.075 --> 31:17.507
Get that to the war room.

31:17.509 --> 31:18.642
Yes, sir.

31:18.644 --> 31:20.043
Start going through it.

31:20.813 --> 31:22.479
Debrief, one hour.

31:28.921 --> 31:31.221
That was intense.

31:32.558 --> 31:34.491
What did you expect?

31:36.228 --> 31:38.495
More like fucked up.

31:40.566 --> 31:44.034
You heard the commander.
We have to push forward.

31:44.036 --> 31:46.203
What happened today
can't hold us back

31:46.205 --> 31:47.537
from completing our mission.

31:47.539 --> 31:49.306
You know what you
signed up for.

32:11.397 --> 32:14.164
[speaking Arabic]

32:18.437 --> 32:20.537
[in English]
We are being hunted.

32:22.808 --> 32:24.207
Americans?

32:25.210 --> 32:28.045
Not sure. It could be.

32:28.047 --> 32:31.348
But they continue to lurk
in the shadows of our cause.

32:31.984 --> 32:33.984
What's the damage?

32:33.986 --> 32:37.054
One of our villages was
hit early in the morning.

32:37.756 --> 32:39.423
Aabib's outpost.

32:39.425 --> 32:41.658
We are still looking
into what was taken.

32:41.660 --> 32:45.495
If he had any information
about our mission,

32:45.497 --> 32:48.799
they could follow the trail
leading them back to us.

32:50.102 --> 32:51.501
And Aabib?

32:52.905 --> 32:55.105
He's dead.

32:55.107 --> 32:57.341
You predicted they will come.

32:58.444 --> 33:00.377
We always expected a fight.

33:01.580 --> 33:02.980
From the beginning.

33:02.982 --> 33:04.448
Not to worry.

33:04.450 --> 33:06.483
They think they are
fighting back-yard clowns

33:06.485 --> 33:09.319
with a rusty AK,
with no concept of war...

33:10.756 --> 33:12.122
but soon they will realize

33:12.124 --> 33:14.024
who they are dealing with
in this battle.

33:14.026 --> 33:16.026
We'll continue
as planned.

33:17.029 --> 33:19.696
Always ahead,
always on the move...

33:20.632 --> 33:22.499
our plans will go forward.

33:25.537 --> 33:27.004
Do you fear them?

33:27.873 --> 33:29.006
No.

33:30.509 --> 33:34.611
You cannot instill fear into
something as simple as an idea.

33:35.814 --> 33:37.414
Fear is mental.

33:38.450 --> 33:42.219
It's an emotion that can be
turned on and off,

33:42.221 --> 33:45.022
like water running from a hose.

33:45.024 --> 33:48.191
A million of their soldiers
can cover these lands,

33:48.193 --> 33:50.327
raid our villages,

33:50.329 --> 33:51.862
but they will win nothing...

33:53.032 --> 33:55.198
change nothing.

33:55.200 --> 33:58.735
The smallest being
poses the greatest threats

33:58.737 --> 34:01.471
to their idea
and way of life.

34:03.008 --> 34:04.908
I do not fear them.

34:04.910 --> 34:06.943
I do not fear anyone.

34:10.516 --> 34:11.882
What about Aabib?

34:12.484 --> 34:14.851
He was coward. Weak.

34:14.853 --> 34:17.687
His work has
run its course for us.

34:17.688 --> 34:22.359
His arrogance and carelessness
landed him in the grave.

34:22.360 --> 34:26.228
I pray for his family,
but I do not mourn his loss.

34:26.231 --> 34:29.565
Loss feeds our need
to push on.

34:30.735 --> 34:34.103
Our faith in you as our leader
has never been stronger.

34:34.106 --> 34:37.474
The men and women
who stand by our side...

34:38.577 --> 34:40.243
do not doubt our cause.

34:41.580 --> 34:43.914
Our mission is clear.

34:43.916 --> 34:47.083
Our path might be rocky

34:47.085 --> 34:50.286
but we will not let one loss
define the moves we make.

34:51.690 --> 34:54.991
I want what you have ready to
move forward to our next camp.

34:56.360 --> 34:58.428
We will continue
preparing the weapons

34:58.430 --> 35:00.163
and prepare the camp
to be moved.

35:03.135 --> 35:05.535
Do not doubt my resolve.

35:05.537 --> 35:07.270
We will win this war.

35:10.075 --> 35:11.808
I never doubted you.

35:12.878 --> 35:16.613
You are feared
across these lands.

35:16.615 --> 35:19.282
Your strength will lead us.

35:19.284 --> 35:22.719
Loyalty is something
much bigger than fear.

35:22.721 --> 35:25.055
Assembled men with an idea

35:25.057 --> 35:28.024
is much stronger than any bomb
you can ever build.

35:29.995 --> 35:31.495
I understand.

35:31.497 --> 35:34.564
Our men will follow suit
and achieve our mission.

35:35.968 --> 35:38.735
Carelessness
will not be tolerated.

35:38.737 --> 35:40.837
Mistakes cannot be made.

35:40.839 --> 35:43.573
We are on course
to change the world.

35:43.575 --> 35:45.075
To accomplish great things,

35:45.077 --> 35:47.744
we must be ready
to sacrifice everything.

35:47.746 --> 35:50.847
I am ready to lay down
my life for you...

35:51.750 --> 35:53.350
for the cause.

35:53.352 --> 35:55.685
We have come too far
for failure.

35:55.687 --> 35:58.455
Let them come.

35:58.457 --> 36:00.757
They'll discover the meaning
behind the masks

36:00.759 --> 36:02.526
and be met with the swift,
crushing blow

36:02.528 --> 36:04.227
of our clenched fists.

36:05.464 --> 36:07.531
They begged for their war.

36:07.533 --> 36:09.666
A war is what they will get.

36:09.668 --> 36:12.836
They finally have met
their match on the battlefield.

36:12.838 --> 36:14.604
We stand with you.

36:15.340 --> 36:16.740
Good.

36:17.676 --> 36:19.376
Make it known around camp.

36:20.612 --> 36:23.046
I want them to be ready
for anything.

36:24.816 --> 36:26.950
If what you say is true,

36:26.952 --> 36:29.853
I want everyone to be ready
at a moment's notice.

36:46.705 --> 36:48.338
What do you think?

36:48.340 --> 36:51.007
Laptops are up and running.
Still trying to pull data.

36:51.009 --> 36:52.909
Other than that,
all we have are these maps.

36:52.911 --> 36:54.311
And?

36:54.313 --> 36:55.845
Each map is different
in a few ways,

36:55.847 --> 36:58.248
but all end up
pointing to one area.

36:58.250 --> 37:00.750
This patch of desert
just south of us.

37:00.752 --> 37:04.087
Nothing there on the scanners,
but to have it on each map,

37:04.089 --> 37:05.589
it makes me think
something's there.

37:06.725 --> 37:08.191
Commander.
Sir.

37:08.193 --> 37:09.926
What do you have for me?

37:09.928 --> 37:11.494
The computers are running the
decryption of the laptop data,

37:11.496 --> 37:13.029
and we found something
on these maps.

37:13.031 --> 37:15.699
We found a stretch of desert
just south of us.

37:15.701 --> 37:17.867
Nothing there,
that we know of.

37:17.869 --> 37:21.371
Each map has the same area mark,
possible hideout.

37:21.373 --> 37:23.840
Get a satellite
over that area.

37:23.842 --> 37:26.309
We might just have found
ourselves a new location.

37:26.878 --> 37:27.978
Good work.

37:37.956 --> 37:39.589
[device beeping]

38:31.243 --> 38:34.377
[speaking Arabic]

39:06.611 --> 39:08.878
He was a true warrior.

39:11.116 --> 39:12.615
Now one of the best.

39:18.623 --> 39:21.758
We've been through the shit
more than a few times.

39:23.628 --> 39:25.295
Pakistan?

39:25.297 --> 39:28.298
Yeah.
[sniffles]

39:28.300 --> 39:30.767
I didn't think we were
gonna make it out of that one.

39:32.137 --> 39:33.636
Yeah.

39:34.339 --> 39:36.439
We fought hard.

39:39.411 --> 39:41.144
We stayed in there.

39:42.881 --> 39:44.814
We made it home.

39:50.555 --> 39:52.288
All right, brother.

39:54.559 --> 39:58.328
To those before us,
to those among us,

39:58.330 --> 40:00.697
and to those we shall see
on the other side.

40:00.699 --> 40:03.833
Lord, let us not prove unworthy
of our brothers.

40:26.191 --> 40:28.158
What?
Nothing.

40:33.365 --> 40:34.764
Spit it out, mate.

40:34.766 --> 40:36.299
What the fuck happened
out there?

40:36.301 --> 40:38.067
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean?

40:38.069 --> 40:40.303
You really think
you're all that, don't you?

40:40.305 --> 40:41.738
You want to make this real?

40:41.740 --> 40:44.474
Hey! Hey, hey!

40:44.476 --> 40:48.311
Hey! Hey, hey, break it up!

40:48.313 --> 40:50.146
Break it up! Break it up.

40:50.148 --> 40:51.281
Keep your fucking dog
off me!

40:51.283 --> 40:52.782
Watch your fucking back!

40:52.784 --> 40:56.085
Hey, calm down.
Look at me. Look at me.

40:56.087 --> 40:57.387
That asshole thinks
he's a one-man army,

40:57.389 --> 40:58.621
while our brother
lays dead in there!

40:58.623 --> 40:59.923
Hey, I didn't kill him!

40:59.925 --> 41:01.858
Give me two fucking seconds,
all right?

41:02.961 --> 41:05.128
Look at me. Huh?

41:05.964 --> 41:07.997
It's nobody's fault.

41:07.999 --> 41:10.600
It's them. They did this.

41:10.602 --> 41:13.770
Now what would Chris want
from us? Hmm?

41:13.772 --> 41:15.805
What would he say
if he were here right now,

41:15.807 --> 41:17.240
and I was the one in the bag?

41:19.144 --> 41:21.511
The mission.
Exactly, the mission.

41:22.681 --> 41:25.348
Now all we got is each other.
Yeah.

41:25.350 --> 41:27.517
Okay. All right?

41:28.820 --> 41:31.588
I don't care what background
or what country you're from.

41:31.590 --> 41:35.158
None of that shit matters.
It's not about you or you or me.

41:35.160 --> 41:37.660
So cut this shit out.
Let's get our heads in the game.

41:37.662 --> 41:39.696
We've got a long road ahead.

41:39.698 --> 41:41.831
A lot of people counting on us.

42:29.881 --> 42:32.015
No. Something's off
with these images.

42:32.017 --> 42:33.716
What is it?

42:33.718 --> 42:36.753
They like to hide in
plain sight, right?

42:36.755 --> 42:38.521
Satellite, zoom in
for better look.

42:38.523 --> 42:40.056
Yes, sir.

42:40.058 --> 42:43.226
[Brisco] Zoom in, keep going.
Hold it right there.

42:46.164 --> 42:47.897
Those coordinates match the map.

42:47.899 --> 42:49.799
Yes, sir.
We're in the right area.

42:53.538 --> 42:55.238
Those tents?

42:55.240 --> 42:57.073
Yeah, it looks abandoned.

42:57.075 --> 42:59.943
Abandoned tents in the middle
of nowhere. Highly unlikely.

42:59.945 --> 43:01.678
What are they up to?

43:03.248 --> 43:06.349
Could be a supply area,
a weapons outpost.

43:06.351 --> 43:08.451
During the Iraq War, we found
outposts all over the place.

43:08.453 --> 43:10.553
Scattered tent cities.
Right.

43:10.555 --> 43:12.455
Their main goal was
to supply surrounding towns

43:12.457 --> 43:14.090
with weapons and ammo
to fight our troops.

43:14.092 --> 43:15.625
Exactly.

43:15.627 --> 43:17.260
That's where they are.

43:17.262 --> 43:18.795
Get a transport.
We go in at first light.

43:18.797 --> 43:19.929
Yes, sir.

43:23.902 --> 43:26.035
I'm telling you,
the food in France

43:26.037 --> 43:28.037
is better than
anywhere in the world.

43:28.039 --> 43:29.772
Not true.

43:29.774 --> 43:32.875
What do you know?
All your food is the same.

43:34.713 --> 43:38.915
I like Chinese food.
I could eat that about now.

43:38.917 --> 43:43.553
Yeah?
Compared to French,
always stuffing things.

43:43.555 --> 43:46.889
My friends,
you have not lived until--

43:46.891 --> 43:48.324
That shit reeks!

43:48.326 --> 43:50.126
What? Really?

43:50.795 --> 43:52.395
Everyone else?

43:53.765 --> 43:54.831
Right here.

43:54.833 --> 43:56.966
Excellent.

43:56.968 --> 43:59.636
The intel you people snagged
is looking like a good lead.

43:59.638 --> 44:02.472
We have eyes on a location of
interest just south of here.

44:02.474 --> 44:05.575
Task is simple. Go in,
check it out. Maybe get lucky.

44:05.577 --> 44:07.310
What's the count on the ground?

44:07.312 --> 44:09.278
Nothing from satellite footage,
but don't take it to heart.

44:09.280 --> 44:11.948
Be ready for anything.
Copy that.

44:11.950 --> 44:13.750
We don't want to attract
any undue attention,

44:13.752 --> 44:16.686
so our bird's going to drop you
two klicks below the target.

44:16.688 --> 44:18.354
Get ready.

44:19.791 --> 44:21.424
Wipe your face, son.

44:21.426 --> 44:23.426
You're a soldier,
not a food critic.

44:37.542 --> 44:41.110
[Brisco over radio]
<i>A lot of ground to cover</i>
<i>down there, guys. Be thorough.</i>

45:43.274 --> 45:45.675
Three, out front.

45:45.677 --> 45:46.876
Anything else?

45:46.878 --> 45:48.277
[Galina]
Main entrance is covered,

45:48.279 --> 45:49.612
but not by much.

45:49.614 --> 45:51.114
Nice, little setup,

45:51.116 --> 45:54.417
probably enough here
to supply a small town.

45:54.419 --> 45:55.885
Jacques, you're with me.

45:55.887 --> 45:57.620
Xu, Ralph and James,
you take the west end.

45:57.622 --> 45:58.988
Copy.

46:00.258 --> 46:01.958
Okay, bro, we got this.

46:01.960 --> 46:04.327
Galina, you know what to do.
Let's move.

46:20.145 --> 46:22.011
Okay, people,
let's get that feed up.

46:36.427 --> 46:38.427
My mission is before me,

46:38.429 --> 46:41.464
and the enemy is around me.

46:41.466 --> 46:42.965
My mission.

46:42.967 --> 46:45.468
[inhales deeply, exhales]

46:45.470 --> 46:47.170
[gunshot]

47:38.656 --> 47:40.756
I got one at twelve o'clock.

47:53.204 --> 47:54.370
Ready?

47:54.372 --> 47:55.805
It's on your go.

48:05.917 --> 48:06.983
Nice work, Galina.

48:10.655 --> 48:13.422
Repositioning now
to the far side.

48:24.235 --> 48:25.568
Xu.

48:36.114 --> 48:37.747
All clear.

48:37.749 --> 48:40.549
Come on. Where is everyone?

48:40.551 --> 48:42.118
It's way too quiet out here.

48:48.192 --> 48:49.926
I have a bad feeling about this.

48:50.628 --> 48:52.128
Keep moving.

49:35.340 --> 49:38.474
You ready? On three.
One.

49:38.476 --> 49:40.676
Two.
Three.

49:43.781 --> 49:45.147
Clear!

49:48.987 --> 49:50.519
What is all this stuff?

49:50.521 --> 49:53.923
Everything you need
to make a bomb. Wires, timers.

49:53.925 --> 49:57.026
Bomb room. They're making
a bomb or made one.

49:58.663 --> 50:00.629
Commander,
we found something.

50:00.631 --> 50:02.331
Go ahead.

50:02.333 --> 50:04.133
[Daniel] <i> We found parts</i>
<i>for making a bomb.</i>

50:05.503 --> 50:08.871
Daniel,
I think we have a problem.

50:09.941 --> 50:13.743
Shit. Sir, I think we have
a dirty bomb in play.

50:15.279 --> 50:17.279
Here we go.

Contact, contact.

Keep moving.
What's your 20?

50:48.679 --> 50:50.713
We're moving south!

50:53.384 --> 50:54.984
Moving south, exit to ten.

Push forward!

He said he'll be
right behind us.

Galina, do you have eyes
on Daniel?

01:00:56.754 --> 01:00:59.221

01:02:11.028 --> 01:02:12.394
Come on.
We'll get him back.

01:02:13.163 --> 01:02:14.596
Let's go.

01:02:14.598 --> 01:02:17.833
[shouting in Arabic]

01:02:32.416 --> 01:02:34.516
Hello, Daniel.

01:02:45.062 --> 01:02:47.262
[pilot] <i> Ten minutes out.</i>

01:02:57.141 --> 01:02:58.740
We'll get him back.

01:02:58.742 --> 01:03:00.675
Sir, they're going to
fucking kill him.

01:03:01.879 --> 01:03:03.779
I've got him.

01:03:31.909 --> 01:03:34.009
Marino, get the president
on the line.

01:03:50.694 --> 01:03:52.327
James.

01:03:55.699 --> 01:03:57.933
These guys are the real deal.

01:03:57.935 --> 01:03:59.668
Yeah, and so are we.

01:03:59.670 --> 01:04:02.437
And we're gonna take every last
one of them out to find him.

01:04:05.275 --> 01:04:07.108
We have to bring him back.

01:04:07.110 --> 01:04:10.512
And we will.
We're a team.

01:04:23.060 --> 01:04:25.527
[President] <i> Commander,</i>
<i>I've been briefed about Daniel,</i>

01:04:25.529 --> 01:04:28.463
but I need you
to tell me exactly
what's going on over there.

01:04:28.465 --> 01:04:30.632
Even with the capture
of Daniel,

01:04:30.634 --> 01:04:32.500
we've been able to make
some headway.

01:04:32.502 --> 01:04:35.537
We have new intel
that the Black Masks
are making a dirty bomb.

01:04:35.539 --> 01:04:37.172
And what does that mean?

01:04:37.174 --> 01:04:39.708
Team discovered a bomb room
in a tent compound,

01:04:39.710 --> 01:04:41.009
evidence of sarin gas.

01:04:41.011 --> 01:04:43.078
Any ideas on targets?

01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:44.846
Working on that, sir.

01:04:44.848 --> 01:04:47.382
And we know so far they only
have one bomb capacity.

01:04:47.384 --> 01:04:50.352
Commander, let me be
perfectly clear.

01:04:50.354 --> 01:04:52.554
I agree with the other nations.

01:04:52.556 --> 01:04:54.990
We must not,
under any circumstances,

01:04:54.992 --> 01:04:56.691
allow their plan to go forward.

01:04:56.693 --> 01:04:58.026
Understood.

01:04:58.028 --> 01:05:01.062
Now any new technology
requires testing.

01:05:01.064 --> 01:05:02.764
We need to find out

01:05:02.766 --> 01:05:06.401
where they're gonna test it,
any possible sites.

01:05:06.403 --> 01:05:08.370
[Brisco] <i> Yes, sir.</i>

01:05:08.372 --> 01:05:11.006
You keep me updated
on possible targets.

01:05:11.008 --> 01:05:12.107
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

01:05:13.210 --> 01:05:15.911
Do your job, Commander.
Let's get this done.

01:05:42.039 --> 01:05:43.672
Comfortable?

01:05:44.441 --> 01:05:46.174
Let's take a walk.

01:06:12.302 --> 01:06:14.402
Anything?

01:06:14.404 --> 01:06:16.304
[sighs]
Nothing yet, sir.

01:06:17.007 --> 01:06:18.606
Well, keep on it.

01:06:18.608 --> 01:06:20.408
We will find it.

01:06:20.410 --> 01:06:21.810
I need answers!

01:06:21.812 --> 01:06:22.978
Yes, sir.

01:06:24.581 --> 01:06:26.314
What are you working on?

01:06:28.685 --> 01:06:30.852
Some homemade designs.

01:06:34.758 --> 01:06:37.492
We were hit
pretty hard today.

01:06:37.494 --> 01:06:40.495
And this is your idea...

01:06:40.497 --> 01:06:41.830
Yeah.

01:06:41.832 --> 01:06:44.232
This little guy is
one of my own design.

01:06:45.168 --> 01:06:48.603
A little bit of C-4,
equipped with this.

01:06:49.940 --> 01:06:52.674
Place a few of these...

01:06:53.777 --> 01:06:55.810
in a wide enough range,

01:06:55.812 --> 01:06:59.414
and at the right time,
boom...

01:07:00.717 --> 01:07:02.217
Total chaos.

01:07:05.689 --> 01:07:07.389
Officers?

01:07:13.397 --> 01:07:15.130
I think I have found something.

01:07:18.702 --> 01:07:20.301
Get Commander Brisco.

01:07:37.988 --> 01:07:39.087
What do you have?

01:07:39.089 --> 01:07:40.588
It may be nothing, but--

01:07:40.590 --> 01:07:42.257
Go ahead.

01:07:42.259 --> 01:07:45.727
These guys, they have been
unpredictable from the start.

01:07:45.729 --> 01:07:47.996
Always a step ahead,
always prepared.

01:07:47.998 --> 01:07:49.397
Okay.

01:07:49.399 --> 01:07:51.433
So I took some of
their last known locations

01:07:51.435 --> 01:07:52.767
from the intel we have

01:07:52.769 --> 01:07:54.536
and compiled it together.

01:07:54.538 --> 01:07:57.072
The next possible
village attack

01:07:57.074 --> 01:08:00.442
is less than 15 miles
from our last mission.

01:08:01.445 --> 01:08:04.212
Why not walk down the road
and find out?

01:08:04.214 --> 01:08:05.880
In and out.

01:08:05.882 --> 01:08:07.715
If Galina is right,

01:08:07.717 --> 01:08:09.384
this town
would never expect them.

01:08:09.386 --> 01:08:11.619
They're hidden in a valley,
totally helpless.

01:08:11.621 --> 01:08:13.955
Marino, I want SAT images
of the town.

01:08:13.957 --> 01:08:16.791
I want our eye in the sky
all over those guys.

01:08:16.792 --> 01:08:18.926
If they're there,
Daniel's close.

01:08:18.929 --> 01:08:20.428
Understood, sir.

01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:47.055
[coughing]

01:08:48.425 --> 01:08:50.225
[speaking Arabic]

01:09:09.145 --> 01:09:14.149
Do you have the slightest idea
of where you are and who I am?

01:09:16.118 --> 01:09:17.719
Fuck you.

01:09:21.858 --> 01:09:24.591
Your country has
done that already.

01:09:27.296 --> 01:09:29.997
I want you to understand.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.765
I want you to see...

01:09:34.671 --> 01:09:37.205
soldier to soldier.

01:09:46.550 --> 01:09:48.515
Why do you think
you have business here?

01:09:51.321 --> 01:09:53.787
I'm leading a revolution,

01:09:53.790 --> 01:09:56.257
just like your country
once did.

01:09:57.861 --> 01:10:02.630
Yet yours was labeled
heroic and brave...

01:10:04.301 --> 01:10:07.035
and mine is labeled terrorism.

01:10:08.405 --> 01:10:10.605
We fought our wars
for freedom...

01:10:11.575 --> 01:10:13.308
not destruction and chaos.

01:10:14.377 --> 01:10:17.345
You don't think
this is about freedom?

01:10:17.347 --> 01:10:18.446
Is it?

01:10:20.917 --> 01:10:25.820
Countries have occupied
these lands for 16 years.

01:10:26.723 --> 01:10:28.823
Where do my people stand?

01:10:28.825 --> 01:10:31.159
Where do we make our changes?

01:10:31.161 --> 01:10:33.761
Make our plans for our future?

01:10:36.666 --> 01:10:39.234
You took that from my country
and my family

01:10:39.236 --> 01:10:41.236
without permission.

01:10:41.238 --> 01:10:44.439
You made this
your backyard experiment

01:10:44.441 --> 01:10:47.575
without regard to anything
but yourselves.

01:10:50.847 --> 01:10:51.980
No more.

01:10:53.750 --> 01:10:56.751
You and your world

01:10:56.753 --> 01:10:58.953
will be reintroduced to mine

01:10:58.955 --> 01:11:02.857
in the language
we all speak fluently...

01:11:06.863 --> 01:11:08.596
violence.

01:11:12.602 --> 01:11:14.869
Marino, get me the president.
Yes, sir.

01:11:20.744 --> 01:11:22.977
I have Commander Brisco
for the president.

01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:25.446
[President] <i> Any word on Daniel?</i>

01:11:25.448 --> 01:11:26.914
Nothing on Daniel, sir.

01:11:26.916 --> 01:11:28.483
Damn it.

01:11:28.485 --> 01:11:30.985
I want to know as soon
as you do hear something.

01:11:30.987 --> 01:11:33.421
Everything we have suggests
that the Black Masks

01:11:33.423 --> 01:11:36.457
are planning an immediate test
close to the last location.

01:11:36.459 --> 01:11:38.459
Well, expand on that,
please.

01:11:38.461 --> 01:11:40.228
A town just north of
the last outpost.

01:11:40.230 --> 01:11:42.430
Ninety percent chance they're
moving in that direction.

01:11:42.432 --> 01:11:44.432
You think they're going to
test it there?

01:11:44.434 --> 01:11:46.634
Make sure it's operational.
Move forward their objective.

01:11:46.636 --> 01:11:48.069
Yes, sir.
It makes sense to me.

01:11:48.071 --> 01:11:50.138
Well, you keep me informed
around the clock.

01:11:50.140 --> 01:11:52.073
Commander,
I want Daniel back.

01:11:52.075 --> 01:11:55.943
I do not want to lose another
man in this war, understood?

01:11:55.945 --> 01:11:57.512
Understood, sir.

01:12:02.185 --> 01:12:06.354
You come into our world,
waving your flags of freedom,

01:12:06.356 --> 01:12:09.023
expecting us
to fall to our knees.

01:12:10.126 --> 01:12:12.827
But one thing
I'll never understand.

01:12:21.638 --> 01:12:23.838
Your views and culture
are here...

01:12:25.475 --> 01:12:27.942
and my views and culture
are here.

01:12:29.012 --> 01:12:32.914
And in between,
it's just a line in the sand

01:12:34.517 --> 01:12:36.551
that cannot be removed.

01:12:43.693 --> 01:12:45.827
Did you not think
we would not act?

01:12:45.829 --> 01:12:48.363
Did you think
we would not respond?

01:12:50.900 --> 01:12:54.035
Keep thinking that you are
the leaders of the free world.

01:13:06.683 --> 01:13:11.085
Marino. Let the team know
we move out at first light.

01:13:11.087 --> 01:13:12.587
Yes, sir.

01:13:15.392 --> 01:13:16.657
Thanks.

01:13:52.562 --> 01:13:53.761
It's time.

01:14:08.745 --> 01:14:13.080
People, this is your standard
sneak-and-peek operation.

01:14:13.082 --> 01:14:16.317
Not much to explain, but due
to the nature of this mission,

01:14:16.319 --> 01:14:18.386
I want to be clear
about a few things.

01:14:18.388 --> 01:14:22.156
Your drop off point will be
a hike to your objective.

01:14:22.158 --> 01:14:24.792
There's very little intel,
so keep your eyes open.

01:14:24.794 --> 01:14:27.929
Satellite images indicate that
our primary point of interest

01:14:27.931 --> 01:14:29.730
is the village center.

01:14:29.732 --> 01:14:31.599
Expect a crowd,
you'll need to blend in.

01:14:31.601 --> 01:14:35.336
So, traditional
Middle Eastern outfit.

01:14:41.311 --> 01:14:42.910
Nice dress.

01:14:42.912 --> 01:14:45.012
Wait for my order before you
make a move, understood?

01:14:45.014 --> 01:14:46.547
[all] Yes, sir.
Excellent.

01:14:52.856 --> 01:14:54.856
[speaking Arabic]
What is it?

01:14:54.858 --> 01:14:56.591
We are ready for testing.

01:14:56.593 --> 01:14:59.427
The compound,
is it stable?

01:14:59.429 --> 01:15:04.098
Yes, all the tests and research
we've been conducting
are complete.

01:15:04.100 --> 01:15:07.335
We just need an ideal place
to test the compound

01:15:07.337 --> 01:15:10.371
and study the effect of the gas.

01:15:10.373 --> 01:15:11.539
Good.

01:15:12.542 --> 01:15:15.076
There is a village
to the east from here.

01:15:17.313 --> 01:15:21.782
Their town leader is weak,
a puppet for the West.

01:15:21.784 --> 01:15:23.150
He stands at his post

01:15:23.152 --> 01:15:25.553
spreading Western propaganda
to his people.

01:15:26.656 --> 01:15:28.523
The record must be
set straight.

01:15:28.525 --> 01:15:31.459
His people must know the truth
of what we stand for.

01:15:32.529 --> 01:15:34.262
His true is based on lies.

01:15:35.865 --> 01:15:39.066
The West has no business
in these lands,

01:15:39.068 --> 01:15:42.970
no business forcing our people
into a new way of life.

01:15:42.972 --> 01:15:45.206
For far too long,
the West has established

01:15:45.208 --> 01:15:48.409
their so-called leaders
around these lands.

01:15:48.411 --> 01:15:51.312
If it takes every last ounce
of strength in my body

01:15:51.314 --> 01:15:52.980
to complete our mission...

01:15:53.917 --> 01:15:55.650
we will continue our fight.

01:15:56.686 --> 01:15:58.319
We will continue this war...

01:15:59.355 --> 01:16:02.223
until every last one
of those so-called leaders

01:16:02.225 --> 01:16:03.324
have been dethroned.

01:16:03.326 --> 01:16:05.560
The bloodshed that ensues,

01:16:05.562 --> 01:16:08.095
lays firmly on the hands
of the Western world.

01:16:08.097 --> 01:16:11.499
If they want to test my resolve,
let them.

01:16:11.501 --> 01:16:13.034
My fist is clenched.

01:16:13.036 --> 01:16:14.535
My strength is solid.

01:16:14.537 --> 01:16:18.539
I am ready to sacrifice
everything and everyone,

01:16:18.541 --> 01:16:21.175
to prove our idea to the world.

01:16:21.177 --> 01:16:24.412
Worlds cannot be changed
based on a different ideology.

01:16:24.414 --> 01:16:26.714
It has no place in these lands.

01:16:26.716 --> 01:16:30.418
We want nothing more than to be
respected around the world.

01:16:30.420 --> 01:16:35.556
Our lands are filled with riches
beyond belief below the sands.

01:16:35.558 --> 01:16:38.392
Our history is
the history of the world.

01:16:38.394 --> 01:16:40.461
This is our revolution.

01:16:40.463 --> 01:16:42.597
[speaking Arabic]

01:16:42.599 --> 01:16:44.632
[in English]
What about the team?

01:16:44.634 --> 01:16:46.434
Let them come.

01:16:46.436 --> 01:16:48.102
I invite any and all

01:16:48.104 --> 01:16:50.204
who think they can
stand in front of us.

01:16:50.206 --> 01:16:52.873
They will be met with
our overwhelming force.

01:16:52.875 --> 01:16:54.976
They do not understand.

01:16:54.978 --> 01:16:58.045
No, they do not,
but soon they will.

01:17:00.116 --> 01:17:02.783
What about the compound
after detonation?

01:17:02.785 --> 01:17:06.654
Yes, the compound
will be attached to a detonator

01:17:06.656 --> 01:17:08.322
inside a case.

01:17:08.324 --> 01:17:10.925
When the case explodes,

01:17:10.927 --> 01:17:13.461
the gas will be ejected
into the air.

01:17:13.463 --> 01:17:16.097
Within a few minutes,

01:17:16.099 --> 01:17:18.799
the gas will intermix

01:17:18.801 --> 01:17:21.736
with the surrounding air,
surround in the town.

01:17:22.939 --> 01:17:24.805
The effects?

01:17:24.807 --> 01:17:26.540
Total destruction of life.

01:17:27.744 --> 01:17:31.579
They will choke on the broken
promises from the West.

01:17:31.581 --> 01:17:33.280
Great.

01:17:33.282 --> 01:17:35.016
No one will survive.

01:17:36.419 --> 01:17:38.252
Perhaps only then

01:17:38.254 --> 01:17:40.521
they will truly
understand our mission.

01:17:40.523 --> 01:17:44.458
The world must know
what you stand for.

01:17:44.460 --> 01:17:47.528
Together we stand
as the messengers,

01:17:47.530 --> 01:17:51.098
whether we live to see
the success of this mission,

01:17:51.100 --> 01:17:53.300
or die on our mission's path,

01:17:53.302 --> 01:17:55.369
the world will
finally understand

01:17:55.371 --> 01:17:58.272
the gravity of their position
against ours.

01:17:58.274 --> 01:17:59.940
Your line in the sand.

01:17:59.942 --> 01:18:03.711
Exactly. We must stay true
to what we stand for.

01:18:04.681 --> 01:18:07.782
Without that,
we are nothing.

01:18:09.352 --> 01:18:10.851
[speaks Arabic]

01:18:10.853 --> 01:18:14.055
The traitors must face
their fate head on.

01:18:14.057 --> 01:18:16.190
And the American?
Let them come.

01:18:16.192 --> 01:18:19.894
If they have something to prove,
so do we.

01:18:22.231 --> 01:18:23.898
We have the upper hand

01:18:23.900 --> 01:18:27.668
and will continue to be
a step ahead of them as planned.

01:18:27.670 --> 01:18:30.638
Daniel being our guest
is a bonus for us.

01:18:31.641 --> 01:18:34.542
If they come too close,
we'll kill him.

01:18:34.544 --> 01:18:36.811
Once they fail
their mission to stop us,

01:18:36.813 --> 01:18:40.081
we'll send out a message
to the world,

01:18:40.083 --> 01:18:42.550
showing his death as a symbol

01:18:42.552 --> 01:18:45.219
of what will happen
to whoever challenge us.

01:18:45.221 --> 01:18:48.556
For far too long, we have
been used as an experiment.

01:18:48.558 --> 01:18:50.524
They have tried
to show the world

01:18:50.526 --> 01:18:53.160
that our lands can be
transformed and adapted

01:18:53.162 --> 01:18:54.762
to their views and culture.

01:18:54.764 --> 01:18:57.765
Our civilization is one of
the oldest in the history.

01:18:57.767 --> 01:19:01.502
We will not bow down to a nation
that is less than 300 years.

01:19:01.504 --> 01:19:05.339
These lands have beared mankind
for thousands of years.

01:19:05.341 --> 01:19:08.609
They are greatly mistaken
in their way of thinking.

01:19:08.611 --> 01:19:10.578
[speaking Arabic]

01:19:10.580 --> 01:19:16.550
[in English]
Our way of life was built
on tradition and belief.

01:19:16.552 --> 01:19:18.352
In the West,

01:19:18.354 --> 01:19:20.488
their fast-paced lifestyle...

01:19:21.557 --> 01:19:23.457
and their careless actions...

01:19:24.460 --> 01:19:27.695
will be met with a swift,
hammering blow,

01:19:27.697 --> 01:19:29.463
crippling their governments.

01:19:29.465 --> 01:19:34.368
Exactly. Without their leaders,
governments and stock markets,

01:19:34.370 --> 01:19:36.604
their countries will collapse.

01:19:36.606 --> 01:19:39.373
One falling after the other,
begging for mercy.

01:19:39.375 --> 01:19:43.444
<i>Sidi, </i> after our tests,
there is no going back.

01:19:43.446 --> 01:19:47.314
Once completed, they will
forever label us as terrorists.

01:19:47.316 --> 01:19:49.416
Call it whatever you want.

01:19:49.418 --> 01:19:52.753
Terrorism, freedom fighters,
revolutionists...

01:19:52.755 --> 01:19:54.622
It doesn't matter.

01:19:54.624 --> 01:19:57.424
The world will never look at us
in a favorable way.

01:19:57.426 --> 01:19:59.493
Once this mission is over

01:19:59.495 --> 01:20:01.595
and the dust has settled
from this war,

01:20:01.597 --> 01:20:04.331
history will look
back on these moments,

01:20:04.333 --> 01:20:07.568
and a true understanding
of our cause will be determined.

01:20:07.570 --> 01:20:10.304
Our world will survive.

01:20:10.306 --> 01:20:12.506
The tables will
finally be reset,

01:20:12.508 --> 01:20:15.142
and we will take back
our rightful states again.

01:20:15.144 --> 01:20:17.912
If they want to come
for their American brother,

01:20:17.914 --> 01:20:19.313
let them come.

01:20:20.483 --> 01:20:23.250
If they want to come
to change our ideas,

01:20:23.252 --> 01:20:24.985
let them come.

01:20:24.987 --> 01:20:28.255
They are fools for thinking
they have a say in our freedom.

01:20:28.257 --> 01:20:30.191
History will look back
at them

01:20:30.193 --> 01:20:32.193
and their misguided missions,

01:20:32.195 --> 01:20:33.527
and laugh.

01:20:36.799 --> 01:20:38.833
[speaking Arabic]

01:20:48.110 --> 01:20:49.510
[pilot]
<i>Coming up on the drop.</i>

01:20:49.512 --> 01:20:52.079
<i>LZ two mikes out from sound.</i>
<i>Good luck.</i>

01:20:56.552 --> 01:21:00.621
[applause]

01:21:43.266 --> 01:21:45.599
Galina, you good?

01:21:45.601 --> 01:21:47.868
<i> Da. </i> Good.

01:21:47.870 --> 01:21:50.271
Xu, Jacques,
you take the north end.

01:21:50.273 --> 01:21:52.306
Ralph, you're with me.

01:21:55.945 --> 01:21:57.912
Screen up.

01:22:14.196 --> 01:22:15.629
Stay close.

01:22:27.476 --> 01:22:29.476
If this goes bad,
we're sitting ducks.

01:23:20.129 --> 01:23:21.362
I got eyes on them.

01:23:23.332 --> 01:23:25.232
I said no one move.

01:23:27.269 --> 01:23:29.703
Come on, come on.
I know you're there.

01:23:30.639 --> 01:23:32.339
Show yourself.

01:23:40.116 --> 01:23:43.450
[murmuring]

01:23:58.734 --> 01:24:00.801
Moving down the side
of the square.

01:24:15.751 --> 01:24:18.152
[women exclaiming]

01:24:18.154 --> 01:24:19.453
He's here.

01:24:26.495 --> 01:24:27.661
Enough!

01:24:28.998 --> 01:24:31.331
[crowd screaming]

01:24:32.368 --> 01:24:34.768
Sir, we have
a hostage situation.

01:24:34.770 --> 01:24:36.503
[Brisco] <i> Stand down.</i>

01:24:43.112 --> 01:24:44.778
[Brisco]
<i>Galina. What's your status?</i>

01:24:44.780 --> 01:24:46.914
Sixty seconds.

01:25:42.171 --> 01:25:43.370
I'm in position.

01:25:48.944 --> 01:25:51.578
Team! You're here!

01:25:54.617 --> 01:25:58.118
Be careful.
I press this button,

01:25:58.120 --> 01:26:01.688
and the last five minutes
of your lives begin.

01:26:01.690 --> 01:26:03.123
[crowd murmuring]

01:26:03.125 --> 01:26:05.592
Your move!

01:26:05.594 --> 01:26:07.060
Stand fast.

01:26:11.267 --> 01:26:13.000
Wise choice.

01:26:25.681 --> 01:26:27.681
Bomb location?
Center stage.

01:26:27.683 --> 01:26:29.316
Bomb location,
center stage.

01:26:29.318 --> 01:26:30.651
[James]
<i>Forward. Move to the stage!</i>

01:26:30.653 --> 01:26:32.319
[Ralph]
<i>Permission to pursue him.</i>

01:26:32.321 --> 01:26:34.521
Stay on mission,
disarm the bomb.

01:26:40.896 --> 01:26:43.096
Jacques!
Go right now!

01:26:48.871 --> 01:26:51.171
I'm good, I'm good.
It went through my shoulder.

01:26:51.173 --> 01:26:52.806
[indistinct shouting]

01:27:01.350 --> 01:27:03.116
Help me get to that bomb.

01:27:13.429 --> 01:27:15.562
Get these people out of here!

01:27:16.432 --> 01:27:18.098
This way, move!

01:27:24.039 --> 01:27:25.472
Come on, come on!

01:27:34.350 --> 01:27:35.482
And make it count.

01:27:58.941 --> 01:28:00.807
We should get out now!
It won't matter.

01:28:00.809 --> 01:28:02.609
What?
The gas--

01:28:02.611 --> 01:28:03.977
There's enough gas
in this bomb

01:28:03.979 --> 01:28:05.412
to cover
a thousand-yard radius.

01:28:05.414 --> 01:28:06.680
The whole town will be gone.

01:28:08.083 --> 01:28:09.750
How much time?

01:28:09.752 --> 01:28:11.718
Uh, 44 seconds.

01:28:13.088 --> 01:28:14.388
Oh, shit. I can't move my arm.

01:28:14.390 --> 01:28:16.990
Someone's going to
have to do this.

01:28:18.160 --> 01:28:19.593
What's going on down there?

01:28:19.595 --> 01:28:21.228
[James]
<i>Sir, Jacques is fucked up.</i>

01:28:21.230 --> 01:28:22.896
<i>We gotta disarm the bomb.</i>
Get out.

01:28:22.898 --> 01:28:25.299
<i>It won't matter. If this thing</i>
<i>goes off, we're all dead.</i>

01:28:25.301 --> 01:28:28.168
Xu, give Ralph your knife.

01:28:30.739 --> 01:28:32.272
All right.

01:28:32.274 --> 01:28:34.941
Running around the time system
right here, slowly.

01:28:34.943 --> 01:28:37.544
Slowly pull the timer back.
Slowly.

01:28:38.347 --> 01:28:39.513
Twenty seconds.

01:28:39.515 --> 01:28:41.014
Oh, shit.
That's a lot of sarin.

01:28:41.016 --> 01:28:42.582
We're not going to fucking die.
I'm just saying.

01:28:42.584 --> 01:28:43.817
Fifteen seconds.

01:28:43.819 --> 01:28:45.585
Galina, spread out

01:28:45.587 --> 01:28:48.255
the different colors of the
wires attached to the detonator.

01:28:48.257 --> 01:28:49.356
What are the colors?

01:28:49.358 --> 01:28:51.591
Blue, red, white, green.

01:28:51.593 --> 01:28:52.759
[whispering]

01:28:52.761 --> 01:28:53.927
Ten, nine, eight...

01:28:53.929 --> 01:28:55.862
Come on. Do it, do it.

01:28:55.864 --> 01:28:57.097
What color?
Five, four!

01:28:57.099 --> 01:28:58.598
No, it's a backward detonator.

01:28:58.600 --> 01:29:00.701
What? Which one's he cut?
I love my country.

01:29:00.703 --> 01:29:02.269
Green! Cut the green!

01:29:04.540 --> 01:29:06.039
[Galina] Oh!

01:29:06.041 --> 01:29:07.708
Thank God.

01:29:07.710 --> 01:29:10.811
"Thank God"? You didn't know?

01:29:10.813 --> 01:29:12.612
I love my country so much.

01:29:12.614 --> 01:29:15.048
I'd rather die
than cut my country's color.

01:29:15.884 --> 01:29:17.484
[Xu shouting
in foreign language]

01:29:17.486 --> 01:29:19.319
[sighs] Oh.

01:29:19.321 --> 01:29:21.321
We're clear.
We're all clear.

01:29:21.323 --> 01:29:22.756
All right!
Yes!

01:29:24.693 --> 01:29:25.892
This fucking guy.

01:29:25.894 --> 01:29:27.627
Not even a thank you?

01:29:27.629 --> 01:29:29.663
Just hold your breath.

01:29:29.665 --> 01:29:32.632
What a nightmare.
All for what?

01:29:34.336 --> 01:29:36.670
Some symbol, some message

01:29:36.672 --> 01:29:40.474
to say they can do whatever
they want without consequences.

01:29:40.476 --> 01:29:42.376
Dangerous times, man.

01:29:42.378 --> 01:29:44.644
Masked men running
around the globe.

01:29:44.646 --> 01:29:46.813
It's pretty dangerous.

01:29:47.916 --> 01:29:49.216
Thanks for having my back.

01:29:49.218 --> 01:29:51.251
We're a team.

01:29:52.221 --> 01:29:54.254
Yeah... Yeah.

01:29:57.359 --> 01:29:58.792
Let's go.

01:30:51.046 --> 01:30:52.446
We got him.

01:30:54.983 --> 01:30:56.249
Any progress?

01:30:56.251 --> 01:30:58.418
Sir, no leads on Daniel.

01:30:58.420 --> 01:31:00.654
Everybody in
the war room.

01:31:15.404 --> 01:31:17.637
Do you still feel free?

01:31:19.174 --> 01:31:22.642
That red, white and blue
still raging inside of you?

01:31:30.853 --> 01:31:32.586
How free am I?

01:31:35.157 --> 01:31:36.990
How free are you?

01:31:36.992 --> 01:31:38.658
You're on the run.

01:31:38.660 --> 01:31:41.862
Moving from one patch of
fucking desert to another...

01:31:43.298 --> 01:31:45.432
raising your flag to what end?

01:31:46.468 --> 01:31:48.602
[laughs]

01:31:52.307 --> 01:31:55.842
[yells]

01:32:01.049 --> 01:32:02.382
Fuck!

01:32:03.685 --> 01:32:07.187
One day you'll see.
One day you'll understand.

01:32:11.393 --> 01:32:14.060
[laughing]

01:32:27.910 --> 01:32:30.744
As you were.

01:32:30.746 --> 01:32:33.680
The CIA released a video to us.
We uploaded it 20 minutes ago.

01:32:33.682 --> 01:32:36.182
We're still authenticating
the date and time,

01:32:36.184 --> 01:32:39.986
but we know it's Daniel,
so we have proof of life.

01:32:42.758 --> 01:32:44.491
Intel is working around
the clock

01:32:44.493 --> 01:32:47.394
to pull any clues they can
from that video.

01:32:47.396 --> 01:32:49.729
Marino, put it on the screen.

01:32:52.434 --> 01:32:54.167
[groans]

01:32:59.341 --> 01:33:01.675
[Supreme Leader]
<i> One day you'll see.</i>

01:33:01.677 --> 01:33:03.677
<i> One day you'll understand.</i>

01:33:15.357 --> 01:33:17.257
You know what this means?

01:33:18.226 --> 01:33:20.794
Yeah. It means
we're going after Daniel,

01:33:20.796 --> 01:33:22.963
and we're going to kill
this prick.

01:33:22.965 --> 01:33:24.531
Count me in.

01:33:25.701 --> 01:33:27.267
Me too.

01:33:27.769 --> 01:33:29.102
Team, right?

01:33:29.104 --> 01:33:30.470
Right.

01:33:31.907 --> 01:33:34.040
Hell, you're already
deemed rogue.

01:33:34.042 --> 01:33:36.042
Sir, when do we start?

01:33:36.578 --> 01:33:38.044
Now.
