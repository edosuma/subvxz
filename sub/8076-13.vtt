WEBVTT

00:04.305 --> 00:05.673
[music playing]

00:10.244 --> 00:13.081
Well, Jackie, some
things never change.

00:13.114 --> 00:16.350
Millions of dollars
and still no life.

00:16.384 --> 00:17.351
Dan--

00:17.385 --> 00:19.353
Hm-- If you're
looking for Roseanne,

00:19.387 --> 00:22.056
she had to go back to the mall.

00:22.090 --> 00:25.059
All the kids went to see
that dalmatian movie.

00:25.093 --> 00:26.160
Some coffee?

00:26.194 --> 00:28.262
No.

00:28.296 --> 00:29.463
Hey, how's your mom doing?

00:29.497 --> 00:31.765
Good-- she's good-- real good.

00:31.799 --> 00:34.335
Because I know we
didn't get to talk.

00:34.368 --> 00:36.504
You know, with all the holiday
stuff going on everything--

00:36.537 --> 00:39.540
and I just wondered what
you were doing to kill

00:39.573 --> 00:41.075
time out there in California?

00:41.109 --> 00:43.010
Well, you know, I got my
mom set up with the facility.

00:43.043 --> 00:44.578
And I saw some sites--

00:44.612 --> 00:46.780
drove up the coast.

00:46.814 --> 00:48.116
That's about it.

00:48.149 --> 00:49.883
Oh, I spent a lot of
time picking avocados

00:49.917 --> 00:50.884
off my sandwiches.

00:50.918 --> 00:53.387
They put it on
everything out there.

00:53.421 --> 00:55.323
Well, you were out there for
a couple of months, though.

00:55.356 --> 00:57.991
You meet anybody interesting?

00:58.025 --> 01:00.594
Hey, I saw Don Rickles
at a gas station--

01:00.628 --> 01:03.531
that hockey puck.

01:03.564 --> 01:06.267
But nobody else though?

01:06.300 --> 01:08.969
Well, I didn't go out
there celebrity stalking.

01:09.002 --> 01:10.504
Well, what would you
do on an average day?

01:10.538 --> 01:11.739
You know-- because
I know that you

01:11.772 --> 01:13.441
would go visit your mom
at the hospital, but then

01:13.474 --> 01:15.075
what would you do?

01:15.109 --> 01:16.310
I don't know-- have lunch.

01:16.344 --> 01:17.611
Alone?

01:17.645 --> 01:18.679
That had to have been hard.

01:18.712 --> 01:20.714
You know, nobody to
talk to or eat with.

01:20.748 --> 01:22.650
Well, Jackie, obviously,
I talked to people.

01:22.683 --> 01:23.884
Yeah, but, like,
who in particular?

01:23.917 --> 01:25.186
Jackie, what else
do you want to know?

01:25.219 --> 01:27.555
What color shirt
I wore every day?

01:27.588 --> 01:29.757
Hey, I got a jaywalking
ticket from a bicycle cop.

01:29.790 --> 01:31.325
I gave him some sass
about his bare legs

01:31.359 --> 01:33.127
and he upsided me in the
head with a bicycle pump.

01:33.161 --> 01:35.963
How's that?

01:35.996 --> 01:37.731
Were you walking across
the street all by yourself?

01:37.765 --> 01:38.866
What the hell are
you talking about?

01:38.899 --> 01:40.301
I'm just trying to
figure out who you were

01:40.334 --> 01:42.270
on the phone with yesterday.

01:42.303 --> 01:44.905
Oh, you mean my mom.

01:44.938 --> 01:48.709
Well, it didn't
sound like that to me.

01:48.742 --> 01:53.281
Thanks for being so
great with my mom.

01:53.314 --> 01:56.016
Well, it's one of
my mom's doctors.

01:56.049 --> 01:57.618
It was hard being away
from you for Christmas.

01:57.651 --> 02:00.354
See, that's what
I'm not getting.

02:00.388 --> 02:03.090
You wanted to spend
Christmas with her doctor?

02:03.123 --> 02:04.425
Well, I mean--
and where the hell

02:04.458 --> 02:07.328
do you get off listening to
my conversations in my house?

02:07.361 --> 02:08.462
Oh, don't turn
it around on me.

02:08.496 --> 02:09.797
I just want to know what
the hell is going on.

02:09.830 --> 02:10.698
Nothing's going on.

02:10.731 --> 02:12.466
That's bull and you know it.

02:25.446 --> 02:26.514
What is going on, Dan?

02:31.252 --> 02:35.756
THEME SONG: What doesn't kill
us is making us stronger.

02:35.789 --> 02:40.328
What's going to last longer than
that greatest wall in China?

02:40.361 --> 02:43.497
Or that rabbit with the drum.

02:43.531 --> 02:47.968
If there's one thing
that I've learned,

02:48.001 --> 02:51.805
while waiting for my turn,
it's that in each life

02:51.839 --> 02:55.509
some rain falls, but
you also get some sun.

02:55.543 --> 03:00.281
And we'll make out
better than OK.

03:00.314 --> 03:03.751
Hear what I say.

03:03.784 --> 03:06.186
Yeah-- any day.

03:17.731 --> 03:20.368
What was going
on out there, Dan?

03:20.401 --> 03:22.803
Please tell me that it's
not what I think it is.

03:28.208 --> 03:30.744
Oh my god.

03:30.778 --> 03:35.349
It is, isn't it.

03:35.383 --> 03:36.617
Oh my god.

03:41.722 --> 03:42.523
Who is she?

03:45.559 --> 03:47.328
She's my mother's nurse.

03:47.361 --> 03:49.597
Oh Dan-- oh my god.

03:49.630 --> 03:53.166
Dan, how could you do that?

03:53.200 --> 03:54.668
Jackie, you don't understand.

03:54.702 --> 03:55.769
No.

03:55.803 --> 03:57.571
I know it's got to be
really complicated.

03:57.605 --> 03:59.172
Jackie, nothing has happened.

04:02.109 --> 04:03.344
We have feelings for each other.

04:03.377 --> 04:05.546
Dan, just-- oh, come on.

04:05.579 --> 04:10.684
Do you-- see, now that you
have money, you think now,

04:10.718 --> 04:12.620
all of a sudden,
you're Mr. Popular?

04:12.653 --> 04:14.154
Do you think that
this woman wants

04:14.187 --> 04:15.589
you for your girlish figure?

04:18.659 --> 04:20.127
This has nothing
to do with money.

04:20.160 --> 04:21.261
No, right-- no.

04:21.295 --> 04:24.064
It's a 45-year-old married
man with four kids.

04:24.097 --> 04:26.567
What a catch.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.869
Are you spending a
lot of money on her?

04:28.902 --> 04:31.305
Just because she likes me
to take her to nice places

04:31.339 --> 04:32.706
doesn't mean that
she's after my money.

04:32.740 --> 04:34.608
No-- no, of
course, it doesn't.

04:34.642 --> 04:37.077
She would like you just as much
if you were still a dry waller.

04:37.110 --> 04:39.613
She would-- see,
you don't know her.

04:39.647 --> 04:41.449
So you have no idea what
you're talking about.

04:41.482 --> 04:43.083
No, but I don't need
to know her to know

04:43.116 --> 04:44.552
that she's not your wife.

04:44.585 --> 04:46.520
Look, Jackie, I've been
over and over this trying

04:46.554 --> 04:47.621
to figure out what happened.

04:47.655 --> 04:49.423
I don't know, maybe
there is a part

04:49.457 --> 04:50.658
of me that needed something.

04:50.691 --> 04:54.795
Well, I know exactly
what part that was.

04:54.828 --> 04:56.196
Jackie, you don't understand.

04:56.229 --> 04:57.365
Nothing has happened.

04:57.398 --> 05:00.401
And you have no idea
what this is doing to me.

05:00.434 --> 05:02.202
Being back around
the family-- trying

05:02.235 --> 05:04.972
to pretend that everything
is back the way it was.

05:05.005 --> 05:06.206
The guilt is eating me alive.

05:06.239 --> 05:09.410
When are you going
to tell Roseanne?

05:09.443 --> 05:10.578
Soon-- OK.

05:10.611 --> 05:13.814
I just have to find
the right words.

05:13.847 --> 05:14.715
I still love her.

05:14.748 --> 05:17.685
Cut the crap.

05:17.718 --> 05:19.052
Feelings are one thing.

05:19.086 --> 05:20.621
It's what you do that counts.

05:20.654 --> 05:22.155
I'm not saying
what I did was right,

05:22.189 --> 05:23.524
but you've got to
understand something.

05:23.557 --> 05:24.892
I married young.

05:24.925 --> 05:26.226
I gave up a lot in my life.

05:26.259 --> 05:28.195
Oh, boo hoo-- who hasn't?

05:28.228 --> 05:29.897
Jackie, you don't
know what it's like.

05:29.930 --> 05:32.199
Things are different out there.

05:32.232 --> 05:33.367
Life is easier.

05:33.401 --> 05:35.268
People are 60 years
old-- they look 40.

05:35.302 --> 05:37.471
It's 72 degrees and
sunny all the time.

05:37.505 --> 05:39.239
It's not like here.

05:39.272 --> 05:42.443
I don't know why I expected
better from you, Dan.

05:42.476 --> 05:44.244
It is very clear to
me, now, that the apple

05:44.277 --> 05:45.813
doesn't fall far from the tree.

05:45.846 --> 05:47.114
What the hell's
that supposed to mean?

05:47.147 --> 05:49.617
Your father also had, kind
of, an eye for the ladies,

05:49.650 --> 05:51.218
didn't he-- like
father, like son.

05:51.251 --> 05:52.420
Boy, that's a low blow.

05:52.453 --> 05:54.121
Well, it's true.

05:54.154 --> 05:56.757
All these years, thinking that
you were better than your dad.

05:56.790 --> 05:58.091
You're way out of line.

05:58.125 --> 06:01.695
First time out on the road,
you do the exact same thing.

06:01.729 --> 06:04.565
I guess the Conner men
don't travel very well.

06:04.598 --> 06:05.833
And I will tell you something.

06:05.866 --> 06:07.935
It wouldn't surprise me if
years from now, your sons

06:07.968 --> 06:09.903
aren't visiting their mother
in a mental institution.

06:09.937 --> 06:13.974
Who in the hell are you to
tell me what to do, anyway?

06:14.007 --> 06:15.175
ROSEANNE: Dan--

06:15.208 --> 06:16.343
You tell her or I will.

06:19.146 --> 06:21.515
Hi, Jackie.

06:21.549 --> 06:23.951
I dropped the kids over at
mom's for an overnighter.

06:26.787 --> 06:27.821
What's up with you guys?

06:27.855 --> 06:29.189
Hmm?

06:29.222 --> 06:31.559
Oh, Jackie and I are having
that same old fight about who's

06:31.592 --> 06:33.594
a better cop, Jimmy
Smits or that guy

06:33.627 --> 06:34.428
that's all showing his ass.

06:41.168 --> 06:42.570
How was the white sale?

06:42.603 --> 06:43.971
Well, it was awesome.

06:44.004 --> 06:47.174
For the first time I didn't
have to buy any irregulars.

06:47.207 --> 06:52.079
All the fitted sheets I got
are shaped just like a bed.

06:52.112 --> 06:54.114
You must be anxious to
get the bedroom remodeled?

06:54.147 --> 06:56.383
Well, hey-- these babies
are top of the line--

06:56.416 --> 06:59.086
350 thread count cotton.

06:59.119 --> 06:59.987
Nice.

07:00.020 --> 07:01.822
Yes, very nice.

07:01.855 --> 07:04.124
Not too nice, though, I hope,
because I still want to be

07:04.157 --> 07:07.761
the softest thing in the bed.

07:07.795 --> 07:10.030
Dan, did you hear what I said?

07:10.063 --> 07:11.932
I was talking about the
sheets, you know-- so I go,

07:11.965 --> 07:13.801
I hope they're not too nice
because I still want to be

07:13.834 --> 07:15.102
the softest thing in the bed.

07:15.135 --> 07:15.936
Yeah--

07:19.306 --> 07:22.876
All right, I'm going to
go, but I will be back.

07:22.910 --> 07:25.178
Hey, yeah, that means
we'll only have what?

07:25.212 --> 07:26.714
Six more weeks of winter, right?

07:31.919 --> 07:33.320
Roseanne, I've got
to tell you something.

07:33.353 --> 07:36.389
Hold it, hold it-- you are
not going to believe this.

07:36.423 --> 07:39.827
I go by the Gas and Sip, you
know, for a bladder buster.

07:39.860 --> 07:43.263
And uh, I look up there
at the tabloid rack,

07:43.296 --> 07:47.467
you know, to see how the
chicken boy scored on his SATs.

07:47.501 --> 07:49.537
And look what I found.

07:49.570 --> 07:52.506
Doesn't need build
theme park in Gaza Strip.

07:52.540 --> 07:54.207
No, not that-- right there--

07:54.241 --> 07:56.710
that Prince-- that Prince
Carlos that Jackie's dating.

07:56.744 --> 07:57.911
Look at that.

07:57.945 --> 08:00.981
Look at that-- he married
his chambermaid, Dan.

08:01.014 --> 08:03.617
He just met her last month,
because as it turns out,

08:03.651 --> 08:05.318
he had never even
been to the West

08:05.352 --> 08:08.656
Wing of his own damn palace.

08:08.689 --> 08:10.490
Says here, it was
love at first sight.

08:10.524 --> 08:12.425
Look at her, Dan,
she's 50 years old.

08:12.459 --> 08:14.928
She's got the crow's feet
and everything like that.

08:14.962 --> 08:17.397
How am I going to tell Jackie?

08:17.430 --> 08:20.868
God-- men are so
damn predictable.

08:20.901 --> 08:24.237
Well, Rose-- I mean, you
don't know the whole situation.

08:24.271 --> 08:25.873
I mean, you know, maybe--

08:25.906 --> 08:27.274
maybe he--

08:27.307 --> 08:29.409
Don't go sticking up for the
guy just because you are one.

08:32.813 --> 08:34.014
You know, I'm just
lucky that I got

08:34.047 --> 08:37.284
me one of the few good ones.

08:37.317 --> 08:39.687
What were you going to tell me?

08:39.720 --> 08:40.487
Nothing.

08:44.057 --> 08:46.393
[music playing]

08:56.369 --> 08:57.738
Here you go.

08:57.771 --> 09:00.674
You've got to keep them elevated
to keep them from swelling up.

09:00.708 --> 09:04.344
DJ, that's so sweet.

09:04.377 --> 09:08.415
All right, what's the
scam, you little grifter?

09:08.448 --> 09:11.985
Well, god, Darlene,
you're 25 weeks pregnant--

09:12.019 --> 09:13.386
just trying to be nice.

09:13.420 --> 09:15.823
Yeah, right-- last night you
didn't fight me for the remote.

09:15.856 --> 09:18.125
This morning you offered
to make me pancakes.

09:18.158 --> 09:19.026
Now I'm getting fed up.

09:19.059 --> 09:20.427
Just tell me what you want.

09:20.460 --> 09:22.295
Come on, Darlene, he's
your little brother.

09:22.329 --> 09:23.731
Just because he's
being nice doesn't

09:23.764 --> 09:25.498
mean he wants something.

09:25.532 --> 09:27.300
I think it's beautiful, DJ.

09:27.334 --> 09:30.237
Shut up, Snow White.

09:30.270 --> 09:31.672
She's right.

09:31.705 --> 09:32.706
I do want something.

09:32.740 --> 09:33.741
All right.

09:33.774 --> 09:36.309
I want to videotape
you giving birth.

09:36.343 --> 09:37.577
Forget it.

09:37.611 --> 09:40.781
You can bring in your
coonskin cap to show and tell.

09:40.814 --> 09:42.115
Well, no, wait a minute.

09:42.149 --> 09:44.584
I mean, this may not have been
the best method of asking,

09:44.618 --> 09:47.220
but we do need
someone to film it.

09:47.254 --> 09:50.924
I don't want this little
creep looking at my patootie.

09:50.958 --> 09:52.325
You film it.

09:52.359 --> 09:55.729
Please-- Darlene,
it's a portal of life.

09:55.763 --> 09:56.897
Besides, I can't film it.

09:56.930 --> 09:58.465
I'm going to be coaching you.

09:58.498 --> 10:00.300
I'm getting really
good with the camera.

10:00.333 --> 10:01.869
Besides, who else
you going to get?

10:01.902 --> 10:04.004
David Stoner, the friend
who did your wedding--

10:04.037 --> 10:06.039
the other 45 minutes
Anne-Marie passed

10:06.073 --> 10:08.742
out in her shrimp cocktail.

10:08.776 --> 10:10.644
I think it's a great idea, DJ.

10:10.678 --> 10:11.578
We'll talk about it.

10:11.611 --> 10:12.680
And we'll get back to you.

10:12.713 --> 10:13.947
All right, but you
got to let me know soon.

10:19.252 --> 10:20.287
Patootie?

10:20.320 --> 10:22.089
Portal of life?

10:22.122 --> 10:24.491
[music playing]

10:28.528 --> 10:31.531
Oh, yeah-- bedroom's
going to be great, Roseanne.

10:31.564 --> 10:34.134
Great-- I-- I like
the, uh-- what do you

10:34.167 --> 10:36.136
call that-- the Medieval theme.

10:36.169 --> 10:37.838
Yeah, well, that's because
I ordered a lot of it

10:37.871 --> 10:39.773
out of the Cher's catalog here.

10:39.807 --> 10:42.743
Boy, she's just got great taste.

10:42.776 --> 10:44.978
She can make any room
in your house look

10:45.012 --> 10:49.549
like a dungeon for
less than $10,000.

10:49.582 --> 10:54.621
Jackie-- um, I want
to talk to you.

10:54.654 --> 10:57.324
Oh, we don't really
need to talk, Roseanne.

10:57.357 --> 10:59.026
We talk all the time.

10:59.059 --> 11:00.027
No, come on--

11:00.060 --> 11:00.928
it's different.

11:00.961 --> 11:02.595
Sit down.

11:02.629 --> 11:05.232
It's best that you
hear this from me.

11:05.265 --> 11:06.266
What?

11:06.299 --> 11:07.067
Sit down.

11:11.138 --> 11:15.542
[sigh]

11:15.575 --> 11:18.545
There's-- there's just
no easy way to say this.

11:18.578 --> 11:22.249
Oh my god--

11:22.282 --> 11:23.984
Let's face it Jackie.

11:24.017 --> 11:27.888
Some relationships just are
not meant to last forever.

11:27.921 --> 11:33.293
Yeah, but this one, you know,
I thought would be different.

11:33.326 --> 11:34.194
Oh, you know?

11:34.227 --> 11:36.263
Yeah, I know.

11:36.296 --> 11:37.230
Men are dogs.

11:37.264 --> 11:38.498
Oh, they are--

11:38.531 --> 11:41.368
Roseanne, they are dogs.

11:41.401 --> 11:42.535
And they are pigs.

11:42.569 --> 11:47.674
And they are swine,
which are pigs.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.877
Yeah, but at least
pigs have an excuse--

11:49.910 --> 11:51.244
they're pigs.

11:51.278 --> 11:53.013
So what is it with men?

11:53.046 --> 11:54.347
Why are they so pathetic?

11:54.381 --> 11:55.448
I don't know.

11:55.482 --> 11:56.884
I guess they're just
little babies, you know.

11:56.917 --> 11:58.285
And they miss their
mommies or something--

11:58.318 --> 12:01.021
they got to get somebody
else to take care of them.

12:01.054 --> 12:02.289
That's why they
always fall in love

12:02.322 --> 12:06.794
with her maids, or waitresses,
or nurses, you know.

12:06.827 --> 12:11.631
I just-- I can't believe
it's over, finished, kaput.

12:11.664 --> 12:15.202
Well, now that it's over
I want you know something.

12:15.235 --> 12:16.469
I never really liked
the guy anyhow.

12:19.539 --> 12:20.507
What?

12:20.540 --> 12:22.742
It was all like
an act, you know.

12:22.776 --> 12:24.812
He smelled the money.

12:24.845 --> 12:26.914
How can you say that?

12:26.947 --> 12:28.782
--because I'm
just being honest.

12:28.816 --> 12:30.450
And honestly, I
can't even believe

12:30.483 --> 12:31.418
that it lasted this long.

12:37.290 --> 12:39.426
I mean, I didn't believe
it when I read it

12:39.459 --> 12:44.364
in the Globe or the Star, but
when I seen it in the Enquirer,

12:44.397 --> 12:47.700
I knew it had to be true.

12:47.734 --> 12:48.735
It was in the Enquirer?

12:54.842 --> 12:55.642
Oh my god!

12:59.312 --> 13:03.283
Jackie, we are going to
get through this together.

13:03.316 --> 13:05.618
[music playing]

13:12.059 --> 13:14.862
You know, I don't know
about DJ taping the birth.

13:14.895 --> 13:17.497
Oh, he'll be fine.

13:17.530 --> 13:21.301
OK, DJ, watch this tape of
our friend Janet giving birth.

13:21.334 --> 13:23.837
This is an excellent example
of what we're looking for.

13:23.871 --> 13:25.538
Yo, Spielberg, pillow--

13:29.042 --> 13:34.147
See, the camera is present,
but unobtrusive, you know.

13:34.181 --> 13:36.549
OK, DJ, just to help you
out, that person in the middle

13:36.583 --> 13:37.417
of the screen is a woman.

13:40.620 --> 13:41.488
OK.

13:41.521 --> 13:42.622
There she is--

13:42.655 --> 13:44.824
100% effaced.

13:44.858 --> 13:45.725
OK.

13:45.758 --> 13:48.528
It's crowning.

13:48.561 --> 13:51.064
That's the doctor
picking up the scissors

13:51.098 --> 13:53.733
to perform the episiotomy.

13:53.766 --> 13:55.903
Just a little clip
for the perineum to make

13:55.936 --> 13:59.272
room for the baby's head.

13:59.306 --> 14:01.108
Man, that's a lot of blood.

14:04.244 --> 14:05.778
DAVID: Oh, here comes the baby.

14:05.812 --> 14:08.615
God, isn't that beautiful?

14:08.648 --> 14:11.618
DARLENE: Wow, look at that
gush of amniotic fluid.

14:16.123 --> 14:18.458
[music playing]

14:27.834 --> 14:31.438
Hey, this Cher catalog's got
some stuff I think we'll both

14:31.471 --> 14:32.839
like-- like this wallpaper.

14:32.872 --> 14:34.041
OK.

14:34.074 --> 14:36.676
This here's a chastity
belt, but from a distance

14:36.709 --> 14:39.947
I think it looks
like a tool belt.

14:39.980 --> 14:40.780
Yeah, great--

14:43.583 --> 14:47.220
So I told Jackie
about the Prince.

14:47.254 --> 14:51.992
She didn't even seem that
upset, but you know Jackie.

14:52.025 --> 14:54.194
Yeah, well, if he's
anything like the Moldavians

14:54.227 --> 14:56.263
I've met, to hell with him.

14:56.296 --> 14:58.966
Well, she said his toes
were all webbed and stuff,

14:58.999 --> 15:02.035
you know, because all
the inbreeding, I guess.

15:02.069 --> 15:04.904
Look, Roseanne, a lots gone
down over the last six months.

15:04.938 --> 15:07.140
And I've had a real hard
time dealing with it.

15:07.174 --> 15:09.943
Well, yeah, it's been rough on
all of us, Dan, but, you know,

15:09.977 --> 15:12.345
now that you're home
we'll get back to normal.

15:12.379 --> 15:13.780
Well, yeah-- even
though I'm home I still

15:13.813 --> 15:15.115
feel like I'm somewhere else.

15:15.148 --> 15:16.516
Well, that's
because you got a lot

15:16.549 --> 15:19.552
of that residual California crap
still left out in your system,

15:19.586 --> 15:20.753
you know.

15:20.787 --> 15:23.056
You'll be fine again once
you get back to drinking

15:23.090 --> 15:25.192
water out of the tap.

15:25.225 --> 15:27.995
You know, when I was
alone and away out there

15:28.028 --> 15:31.064
I had a lot of time
to think about things.

15:31.098 --> 15:34.067
And I feel like there's
something inside--

15:34.101 --> 15:36.769
you know, something's missing.

15:36.803 --> 15:40.007
Like, there's a big hole there.

15:40.040 --> 15:43.376
Well, as long as there's
no exit wound I don't

15:43.410 --> 15:45.678
think we should worry about it.

15:45.712 --> 15:47.180
I don't what I'm saying here.

15:47.214 --> 15:48.715
I've got something
really hard to tell you.

15:48.748 --> 15:51.151
And I don't know how to start.

15:51.184 --> 15:53.186
Well, I am your wife, Dan.

15:53.220 --> 15:54.487
I think you can tell me--

15:54.521 --> 15:56.023
Roseanne, something really,
really awful has happened.

15:56.056 --> 15:56.856
I've met someone.

16:06.533 --> 16:07.400
Someone?

16:07.434 --> 16:08.235
I met a woman.

16:11.204 --> 16:12.139
OK.

16:12.172 --> 16:17.844
So by met, you
don't mean just met

16:17.877 --> 16:20.580
or it wouldn't have taken
you so long to tell me.

16:20.613 --> 16:23.583
It's more than just met.

16:23.616 --> 16:24.417
How much more?

16:27.120 --> 16:30.223
I met her at the hospital.

16:30.257 --> 16:31.324
Oh, yeah?

16:31.358 --> 16:33.493
So-- so there's a chance
she'll be dead soon?

16:36.629 --> 16:38.865
She's my mother's nurse.

16:38.898 --> 16:39.766
What?

16:39.799 --> 16:41.601
I didn't sleep with her.

16:41.634 --> 16:42.969
Roseanne, you got
to believe this.

16:43.002 --> 16:44.304
I did not go looking for this.

16:44.337 --> 16:45.405
I didn't plan on this.

16:45.438 --> 16:46.973
If I had a choice this
wouldn't have happened.

16:47.006 --> 16:48.608
Wait a minute.
If you had a choice--

16:48.641 --> 16:50.143
you didn't really just
say that to me, did you?

16:50.177 --> 16:51.444
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

16:51.478 --> 16:54.281
It's just-- look, after I
had my heart attack I got--

16:54.314 --> 16:55.215
I got spooked.

16:55.248 --> 16:58.985
I started facing
my own mortality.

16:59.018 --> 17:01.554
Oh, I get it.

17:01.588 --> 17:03.223
She's younger--

17:03.256 --> 17:04.257
Oh, Rosey--
ROSEANNE: No.

17:04.291 --> 17:05.158
I'm right, aren't I?

17:05.192 --> 17:06.326
How much younger than me is she?

17:06.359 --> 17:09.796
Come on, Roseanne-- what
do you want me to say?

17:09.829 --> 17:11.431
So what does she
do for you, Dan?

17:11.464 --> 17:12.499
She hangs on your every word.

17:12.532 --> 17:13.700
What?

17:13.733 --> 17:15.502
She rubs the knots out
of the back of your neck.

17:15.535 --> 17:18.571
Does your mother know what
you were doing out there?

17:18.605 --> 17:20.273
No.

17:20.307 --> 17:22.109
I don't know what I
was doing out there.

17:25.278 --> 17:28.781
I don't know what else to say.

17:28.815 --> 17:31.218
Well, are you
in love with her?

17:34.187 --> 17:36.389
I'm very confused.

17:36.423 --> 17:37.524
I know that I still love you.

17:40.160 --> 17:41.828
Oh my god-- who
wrote that line?

17:44.797 --> 17:45.698
I'm sorry.

17:45.732 --> 17:46.533
I'm sorry.

17:53.106 --> 17:54.774
Well, this never would
have happened if we hadn't

17:54.807 --> 17:55.608
won that money, would it?

17:58.578 --> 17:59.546
So what now, Dan?

17:59.579 --> 18:01.714
We're part of the
privileged class.

18:01.748 --> 18:04.984
And I get to give you
the typical response

18:05.017 --> 18:07.220
of the numb society wife.

18:07.254 --> 18:08.588
Like I'm supposed to
look the other way

18:08.621 --> 18:13.092
when they catch you in a
hotel with some call girl.

18:13.126 --> 18:15.395
Well, I don't have
that blindness

18:15.428 --> 18:16.929
that only money can buy, Dan.

18:16.963 --> 18:19.366
I'm not Rose Kennedy.

18:19.399 --> 18:22.135
I'm working class.

18:22.169 --> 18:24.304
And that means there's a
right and there's wrong.

18:24.337 --> 18:27.073
There's black and there's white.

18:27.106 --> 18:29.876
And no amount of money is
going to get me to see gray.

18:29.909 --> 18:31.978
I know that.

18:32.011 --> 18:34.113
And I know that I have
a duty to this family.

18:34.147 --> 18:35.582
And I intend to see it through.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.350
So that's what we are to
you after all these years,

18:37.384 --> 18:39.519
Dan-- you're duty, right?

18:39.552 --> 18:40.753
Well, isn't that
just great for you.

18:40.787 --> 18:43.823
Then you get to be the
hero and the martyr.

18:43.856 --> 18:45.892
Well, don't bother, Dan,
because while you were gone

18:45.925 --> 18:47.194
I learned something too.

18:47.227 --> 18:49.128
I'm going to be fine.

18:49.162 --> 18:50.330
It's killing me, Roseanne.

18:50.363 --> 18:52.199
You've got to understand
this is tearing me apart.

18:57.136 --> 18:59.406
After all these
years this is truly--

18:59.439 --> 19:01.674
truly, the very last
thing I would have

19:01.708 --> 19:03.476
ever expected our of you, Dan.

19:08.047 --> 19:10.183
Your duty is over.

19:10.217 --> 19:13.186
You're free.

19:13.220 --> 19:23.263
Go-- You know.

19:23.263 --> 19:33.273
Go-- You know.

19:49.289 --> 19:50.557
I overheard him on the phone.

19:50.590 --> 19:51.624
Why didn't you tell me?

19:51.658 --> 19:53.293
I thought it was
better coming from him,

19:53.326 --> 19:55.495
but if he didn't tell
you, then I was going to.

19:55.528 --> 20:00.733
Gal-- god, it's
like I never knew him.

20:00.767 --> 20:02.702
If he could do this
to you after everything

20:02.735 --> 20:06.473
that you guys have been through
then maybe you're better off.

20:14.381 --> 20:16.416
You know what I
just figured out?

20:16.449 --> 20:19.085
We got dumped on
the very same day.

20:19.118 --> 20:21.754
Oh, now that's a first.

20:21.788 --> 20:28.094
Well-- I know you're not
used to it, but I am, so--

20:28.127 --> 20:30.730
and I'll tell you something
too, this is not an ending.

20:30.763 --> 20:33.165
This is a beginning.

20:33.199 --> 20:35.535
I knew something was going on.
I told you.

20:35.568 --> 20:36.669
Listen to me.

20:36.703 --> 20:37.570
We are young.

20:37.604 --> 20:39.306
We are rich.

20:39.339 --> 20:41.274
And we are free.

20:41.308 --> 20:43.610
We are entering the
prime of our lives.

20:43.643 --> 20:46.979
And there is no man
there to hold us back.

20:47.013 --> 20:49.549
We have got one
less egg to answer--

20:49.582 --> 20:51.718
one less bell to fry.

20:51.751 --> 20:57.690
We can do anything
we want to do.

20:57.724 --> 21:01.227
So don't you worry
because we're going

21:01.260 --> 21:04.531
to get through this together.

21:04.564 --> 21:06.899
[music playing]

21:15.575 --> 21:18.010
OK.
I can do this.

21:18.044 --> 21:22.081
